PRELUDE
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Who
that
cares
much
to
know
the
history
of
man
,
and
how
the
mysterious
*NL*
mixture
behaves
under
the
varying
experiments
of
Time
,
has
not
dwelt
,
*NL*
at
least
briefly
,
on
the
life
of
Saint
Theresa
,
has
not
smiled
with
*NL*
some
gentleness
at
the
thought
of
the
little
girl
walking
forth
one
*NL*
morning
hand-in-hand
with
her
still
smaller
brother
,
to
go
and
seek
*NL*
martyrdom
in
the
country
of
the
Moors
?
Out
they
toddled
from
rugged
*NL*
Avila
,
wide-eyed
and
helpless-looking
as
two
fawns
,
but
with
human
*NL*
hearts
,
already
beating
to
a
national
idea
;
until
domestic
reality
met
*NL*
them
in
the
shape
of
uncles
,
and
turned
them
back
from
their
great
*NL*
resolve
.
That
child-pilgrimage
was
a
fit
beginning
.
Theresa
's
*NL*
passionate
,
ideal
nature
demanded
an
epic
life
:
what
were
many-volumed
*NL*
romances
of
chivalry
and
the
social
conquests
of
a
brilliant
girl
to
*NL*
her
?
Her
flame
quickly
burned
up
that
light
fuel
;
and
,
fed
from
*NL*
within
,
soared
after
some
illimitable
satisfaction
,
some
object
which
*NL*
would
never
justify
weariness
,
which
would
reconcile
self-despair
with
*NL*
the
rapturous
consciousness
of
life
beyond
self
.
She
found
her
epos
in
*NL*
the
reform
of
a
religious
order
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
Spanish
woman
who
lived
three
hundred
years
ago
,
was
certainly
not
*NL*
the
last
of
her
kind
.
Many
Theresas
have
been
born
who
found
for
*NL*
themselves
no
epic
life
wherein
there
was
a
constant
unfolding
of
*NL*
far-resonant
action
;
perhaps
only
a
life
of
mistakes
,
the
offspring
of
*NL*
a
certain
spiritual
grandeur
ill-matched
with
the
meanness
of
*NL*
opportunity
;
perhaps
a
tragic
failure
which
found
no
sacred
poet
and
*NL*
sank
unwept
into
oblivion
.
With
dim
lights
and
tangled
circumstance
*NL*
they
tried
to
shape
their
thought
and
deed
in
noble
agreement
;
but
*NL*
after
all
,
to
common
eyes
their
struggles
seemed
mere
inconsistency
and
*NL*
formlessness
;
for
these
later-born
Theresas
were
helped
by
no
coherent
*NL*
social
faith
and
order
which
could
perform
the
function
of
knowledge
*NL*
for
the
ardently
willing
soul
.
Their
ardor
alternated
between
a
vague
*NL*
ideal
and
the
common
yearning
of
womanhood
;
so
that
the
one
was
*NL*
disapproved
as
extravagance
,
and
the
other
condemned
as
a
lapse
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
have
felt
that
these
blundering
lives
are
due
to
the
inconvenient
*NL*
indefiniteness
with
which
the
Supreme
Power
has
fashioned
the
natures
*NL*
of
women
:
if
there
were
one
level
of
feminine
incompetence
as
strict
as
*NL*
the
ability
to
count
three
and
no
more
,
the
social
lot
of
women
might
*NL*
be
treated
with
scientific
certitude
.
Meanwhile
the
indefiniteness
*NL*
remains
,
and
the
limits
of
variation
are
really
much
wider
than
any
one
*NL*
would
imagine
from
the
sameness
of
women
's
coiffure
and
the
favorite
*NL*
love-stories
in
prose
and
verse
.
Here
and
there
a
cygnet
is
reared
*NL*
uneasily
among
the
ducklings
in
the
brown
pond
,
and
never
finds
the
*NL*
living
stream
in
fellowship
with
its
own
oary-footed
kind
.
Here
and
*NL*
there
is
born
a
Saint
Theresa
,
foundress
of
nothing
,
whose
loving
*NL*
heart-beats
and
sobs
after
an
unattained
goodness
tremble
off
and
are
*NL*
dispersed
among
hindrances
,
instead
of
centring
in
some
*NL*
long-recognizable
deed
.

*NL*
--
The
Maid
's
Tragedy
:
BEAUMONT
AND
FLETCHER
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Brooke
had
that
kind
of
beauty
which
seems
to
be
thrown
into
*NL*
relief
by
poor
dress
.
Her
hand
and
wrist
were
so
finely
formed
that
*NL*
she
could
wear
sleeves
not
less
bare
of
style
than
those
in
which
the
*NL*
Blessed
Virgin
appeared
to
Italian
painters
;
and
her
profile
as
well
as
*NL*
her
stature
and
bearing
seemed
to
gain
the
more
dignity
from
her
plain
*NL*
garments
,
which
by
the
side
of
provincial
fashion
gave
her
the
*NL*
impressiveness
of
a
fine
quotation
from
the
Bible
,
--
or
from
one
of
our
*NL*
elder
poets
,
--
in
a
paragraph
of
to-day
's
newspaper
.
She
was
usually
*NL*
spoken
of
as
being
remarkably
clever
,
but
with
the
addition
that
her
*NL*
sister
Celia
had
more
common-sense
.
Nevertheless
,
Celia
wore
scarcely
*NL*
more
trimmings
;
and
it
was
only
to
close
observers
that
her
dress
*NL*
differed
from
her
sister
's
,
and
had
a
shade
of
coquetry
in
its
*NL*
arrangements
;
for
Miss
Brooke
's
plain
dressing
was
due
to
mixed
*NL*
conditions
,
in
most
of
which
her
sister
shared
.
The
pride
of
being
*NL*
ladies
had
something
to
do
with
it
:
the
Brooke
connections
,
though
not
*NL*
exactly
aristocratic
,
were
unquestionably
``
good
:
''
if
you
inquired
*NL*
backward
for
a
generation
or
two
,
you
would
not
find
any
yard-measuring
*NL*
or
parcel-tying
forefathers
--
anything
lower
than
an
admiral
or
a
*NL*
clergyman
;
and
there
was
even
an
ancestor
discernible
as
a
Puritan
*NL*
gentleman
who
served
under
Cromwell
,
but
afterwards
conformed
,
and
*NL*
managed
to
come
out
of
all
political
troubles
as
the
proprietor
of
a
*NL*
respectable
family
estate
.
Young
women
of
such
birth
,
living
in
a
*NL*
quiet
country-house
,
and
attending
a
village
church
hardly
larger
than
*NL*
a
parlor
,
naturally
regarded
frippery
as
the
ambition
of
a
huckster
's
*NL*
daughter
.
Then
there
was
well-bred
economy
,
which
in
those
days
made
*NL*
show
in
dress
the
first
item
to
be
deducted
from
,
when
any
margin
was
*NL*
required
for
expenses
more
distinctive
of
rank
.
Such
reasons
would
*NL*
have
been
enough
to
account
for
plain
dress
,
quite
apart
from
religious
*NL*
feeling
;
but
in
Miss
Brooke
's
case
,
religion
alone
would
have
*NL*
determined
it
;
and
Celia
mildly
acquiesced
in
all
her
sister
's
*NL*
sentiments
,
only
infusing
them
with
that
common-sense
which
is
able
to
*NL*
accept
momentous
doctrines
without
any
eccentric
agitation
.
Dorothea
*NL*
knew
many
passages
of
Pascal
's
Pensees
and
of
Jeremy
Taylor
by
heart
;
*NL*
and
to
her
the
destinies
of
mankind
,
seen
by
the
light
of
Christianity
,
*NL*
made
the
solicitudes
of
feminine
fashion
appear
an
occupation
for
*NL*
Bedlam
.
She
could
not
reconcile
the
anxieties
of
a
spiritual
life
*NL*
involving
eternal
consequences
,
with
a
keen
interest
in
gimp
and
*NL*
artificial
protrusions
of
drapery
.
Her
mind
was
theoretic
,
and
yearned
*NL*
by
its
nature
after
some
lofty
conception
of
the
world
which
might
*NL*
frankly
include
the
parish
of
Tipton
and
her
own
rule
of
conduct
there
;
*NL*
she
was
enamoured
of
intensity
and
greatness
,
and
rash
in
embracing
*NL*
whatever
seemed
to
her
to
have
those
aspects
;
likely
to
seek
martyrdom
,
*NL*
to
make
retractations
,
and
then
to
incur
martyrdom
after
all
in
a
*NL*
quarter
where
she
had
not
sought
it
.
Certainly
such
elements
in
the
*NL*
character
of
a
marriageable
girl
tended
to
interfere
with
her
lot
,
and
*NL*
hinder
it
from
being
decided
according
to
custom
,
by
good
looks
,
*NL*
vanity
,
and
merely
canine
affection
.
With
all
this
,
she
,
the
elder
of
*NL*
the
sisters
,
was
not
yet
twenty
,
and
they
had
both
been
educated
,
since
*NL*
they
were
about
twelve
years
old
and
had
lost
their
parents
,
on
plans
*NL*
at
once
narrow
and
promiscuous
,
first
in
an
English
family
and
*NL*
afterwards
in
a
Swiss
family
at
Lausanne
,
their
bachelor
uncle
and
*NL*
guardian
trying
in
this
way
to
remedy
the
disadvantages
of
their
*NL*
orphaned
condition
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
hardly
a
year
since
they
had
come
to
live
at
Tipton
Grange
with
*NL*
their
uncle
,
a
man
nearly
sixty
,
of
acquiescent
temper
,
miscellaneous
*NL*
opinions
,
and
uncertain
vote
.
He
had
travelled
in
his
younger
years
,
*NL*
and
was
held
in
this
part
of
the
county
to
have
contracted
a
too
*NL*
rambling
habit
of
mind
.
Mr.
Brooke
's
conclusions
were
as
difficult
to
*NL*
predict
as
the
weather
:
it
was
only
safe
to
say
that
he
would
act
with
*NL*
benevolent
intentions
,
and
that
he
would
spend
as
little
money
as
*NL*
possible
in
carrying
them
out
.
For
the
most
glutinously
indefinite
*NL*
minds
enclose
some
hard
grains
of
habit
;
and
a
man
has
been
seen
lax
*NL*
about
all
his
own
interests
except
the
retention
of
his
snuff-box
,
*NL*
concerning
which
he
was
watchful
,
suspicious
,
and
greedy
of
clutch
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
Mr.
Brooke
the
hereditary
strain
of
Puritan
energy
was
clearly
in
*NL*
abeyance
;
but
in
his
niece
Dorothea
it
glowed
alike
through
faults
and
*NL*
virtues
,
turning
sometimes
into
impatience
of
her
uncle
's
talk
or
his
*NL*
way
of
``
letting
things
be
''
on
his
estate
,
and
making
her
long
all
the
*NL*
more
for
the
time
when
she
would
be
of
age
and
have
some
command
of
*NL*
money
for
generous
schemes
.
She
was
regarded
as
an
heiress
;
for
not
*NL*
only
had
the
sisters
seven
hundred
a-year
each
from
their
parents
,
but
*NL*
if
Dorothea
married
and
had
a
son
,
that
son
would
inherit
Mr.
Brooke
's
*NL*
estate
,
presumably
worth
about
three
thousand
a-year
--
a
rental
which
*NL*
seemed
wealth
to
provincial
families
,
still
discussing
Mr.
Peel
's
late
*NL*
conduct
on
the
Catholic
question
,
innocent
of
future
gold-fields
,
and
*NL*
of
that
gorgeous
plutocracy
which
has
so
nobly
exalted
the
necessities
*NL*
of
genteel
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
how
should
Dorothea
not
marry
?
--
a
girl
so
handsome
and
with
such
*NL*
prospects
?
Nothing
could
hinder
it
but
her
love
of
extremes
,
and
her
*NL*
insistence
on
regulating
life
according
to
notions
which
might
cause
a
*NL*
wary
man
to
hesitate
before
he
made
her
an
offer
,
or
even
might
lead
*NL*
her
at
last
to
refuse
all
offers
.
A
young
lady
of
some
birth
and
*NL*
fortune
,
who
knelt
suddenly
down
on
a
brick
floor
by
the
side
of
a
sick
*NL*
laborer
and
prayed
fervidly
as
if
she
thought
herself
living
in
the
*NL*
time
of
the
Apostles
--
who
had
strange
whims
of
fasting
like
a
Papist
,
*NL*
and
of
sitting
up
at
night
to
read
old
theological
books
!
Such
a
wife
*NL*
might
awaken
you
some
fine
morning
with
a
new
scheme
for
the
*NL*
application
of
her
income
which
would
interfere
with
political
economy
*NL*
and
the
keeping
of
saddle-horses
:
a
man
would
naturally
think
twice
*NL*
before
he
risked
himself
in
such
fellowship
.
Women
were
expected
to
*NL*
have
weak
opinions
;
but
the
great
safeguard
of
society
and
of
domestic
*NL*
life
was
,
that
opinions
were
not
acted
on
.
Sane
people
did
what
their
*NL*
neighbors
did
,
so
that
if
any
lunatics
were
at
large
,
one
might
know
*NL*
and
avoid
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
rural
opinion
about
the
new
young
ladies
,
even
among
the
cottagers
,
*NL*
was
generally
in
favor
of
Celia
,
as
being
so
amiable
and
*NL*
innocent-looking
,
while
Miss
Brooke
's
large
eyes
seemed
,
like
her
*NL*
religion
,
too
unusual
and
striking
.
Poor
Dorothea
!
compared
with
her
,
*NL*
the
innocent-looking
Celia
was
knowing
and
worldly-wise
;
so
much
*NL*
subtler
is
a
human
mind
than
the
outside
tissues
which
make
a
sort
of
*NL*
blazonry
or
clock-face
for
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
those
who
approached
Dorothea
,
though
prejudiced
against
her
by
*NL*
this
alarming
hearsay
,
found
that
she
had
a
charm
unaccountably
*NL*
reconcilable
with
it
.
Most
men
thought
her
bewitching
when
she
was
on
*NL*
horseback
.
She
loved
the
fresh
air
and
the
various
aspects
of
the
*NL*
country
,
and
when
her
eyes
and
cheeks
glowed
with
mingled
pleasure
she
*NL*
looked
very
little
like
a
devotee
.
Riding
was
an
indulgence
which
she
*NL*
allowed
herself
in
spite
of
conscientious
qualms
;
she
felt
that
she
*NL*
enjoyed
it
in
a
pagan
sensuous
way
,
and
always
looked
forward
to
*NL*
renouncing
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
open
,
ardent
,
and
not
in
the
least
self-admiring
;
indeed
,
it
*NL*
was
pretty
to
see
how
her
imagination
adorned
her
sister
Celia
with
*NL*
attractions
altogether
superior
to
her
own
,
and
if
any
gentleman
*NL*
appeared
to
come
to
the
Grange
from
some
other
motive
than
that
of
*NL*
seeing
Mr.
Brooke
,
she
concluded
that
he
must
be
in
love
with
Celia
:
*NL*
Sir
James
Chettam
,
for
example
,
whom
she
constantly
considered
from
*NL*
Celia
's
point
of
view
,
inwardly
debating
whether
it
would
be
good
for
*NL*
Celia
to
accept
him
.
That
he
should
be
regarded
as
a
suitor
to
herself
*NL*
would
have
seemed
to
her
a
ridiculous
irrelevance
.
Dorothea
,
with
all
*NL*
her
eagerness
to
know
the
truths
of
life
,
retained
very
childlike
ideas
*NL*
about
marriage
.
She
felt
sure
that
she
would
have
accepted
the
*NL*
judicious
Hooker
,
if
she
had
been
born
in
time
to
save
him
from
that
*NL*
wretched
mistake
he
made
in
matrimony
;
or
John
Milton
when
his
*NL*
blindness
had
come
on
;
or
any
of
the
other
great
men
whose
odd
habits
*NL*
it
would
have
been
glorious
piety
to
endure
;
but
an
amiable
handsome
*NL*
baronet
,
who
said
``
Exactly
''
to
her
remarks
even
when
she
expressed
*NL*
uncertainty
,
--
how
could
he
affect
her
as
a
lover
?
The
really
*NL*
delightful
marriage
must
be
that
where
your
husband
was
a
sort
of
*NL*
father
,
and
could
teach
you
even
Hebrew
,
if
you
wished
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
peculiarities
of
Dorothea
's
character
caused
Mr.
Brooke
to
be
all
*NL*
the
more
blamed
in
neighboring
families
for
not
securing
some
*NL*
middle-aged
lady
as
guide
and
companion
to
his
nieces
.
But
he
himself
*NL*
dreaded
so
much
the
sort
of
superior
woman
likely
to
be
available
for
*NL*
such
a
position
,
that
he
allowed
himself
to
be
dissuaded
by
Dorothea
's
*NL*
objections
,
and
was
in
this
case
brave
enough
to
defy
the
world
--
that
*NL*
is
to
say
,
Mrs.
Cadwallader
the
Rector
's
wife
,
and
the
small
group
of
*NL*
gentry
with
whom
he
visited
in
the
northeast
corner
of
Loamshire
.
So
*NL*
Miss
Brooke
presided
in
her
uncle
's
household
,
and
did
not
at
all
*NL*
dislike
her
new
authority
,
with
the
homage
that
belonged
to
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
James
Chettam
was
going
to
dine
at
the
Grange
to-day
with
another
*NL*
gentleman
whom
the
girls
had
never
seen
,
and
about
whom
Dorothea
felt
*NL*
some
venerating
expectation
.
This
was
the
Reverend
Edward
Casaubon
,
*NL*
noted
in
the
county
as
a
man
of
profound
learning
,
understood
for
many
*NL*
years
to
be
engaged
on
a
great
work
concerning
religious
history
;
also
*NL*
as
a
man
of
wealth
enough
to
give
lustre
to
his
piety
,
and
having
views
*NL*
of
his
own
which
were
to
be
more
clearly
ascertained
on
the
publication
*NL*
of
his
book
.
His
very
name
carried
an
impressiveness
hardly
to
be
*NL*
measured
without
a
precise
chronology
of
scholarship
.
*NL*
*NL*
Early
in
the
day
Dorothea
had
returned
from
the
infant
school
which
she
*NL*
had
set
going
in
the
village
,
and
was
taking
her
usual
place
in
the
*NL*
pretty
sitting-room
which
divided
the
bedrooms
of
the
sisters
,
bent
on
*NL*
finishing
a
plan
for
some
buildings
-LRB-
a
kind
of
work
which
she
delighted
*NL*
in
-RRB-
,
when
Celia
,
who
had
been
watching
her
with
a
hesitating
desire
to
*NL*
propose
something
,
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dorothea
,
dear
,
if
you
do
n't
mind
--
if
you
are
not
very
busy
--
suppose
*NL*
we
looked
at
mamma
's
jewels
to-day
,
and
divided
them
?
It
is
exactly
*NL*
six
months
to-day
since
uncle
gave
them
to
you
,
and
you
have
not
looked
*NL*
at
them
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Celia
's
face
had
the
shadow
of
a
pouting
expression
in
it
,
the
full
*NL*
presence
of
the
pout
being
kept
back
by
an
habitual
awe
of
Dorothea
and
*NL*
principle
;
two
associated
facts
which
might
show
a
mysterious
*NL*
electricity
if
you
touched
them
incautiously
.
To
her
relief
,
*NL*
Dorothea
's
eyes
were
full
of
laughter
as
she
looked
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
wonderful
little
almanac
you
are
,
Celia
!
Is
it
six
calendar
or
*NL*
six
lunar
months
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
the
last
day
of
September
now
,
and
it
was
the
first
of
April
*NL*
when
uncle
gave
them
to
you
.
You
know
,
he
said
that
he
had
forgotten
*NL*
them
till
then
.
I
believe
you
have
never
thought
of
them
since
you
*NL*
locked
them
up
in
the
cabinet
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
dear
,
we
should
never
wear
them
,
you
know
.
''
Dorothea
spoke
in
a
*NL*
full
cordial
tone
,
half
caressing
,
half
explanatory
.
She
had
her
*NL*
pencil
in
her
hand
,
and
was
making
tiny
side-plans
on
a
margin
.
*NL*
*NL*
Celia
colored
,
and
looked
very
grave
.
``
I
think
,
dear
,
we
are
wanting
*NL*
in
respect
to
mamma
's
memory
,
to
put
them
by
and
take
no
notice
of
*NL*
them
.
And
,
''
she
added
,
after
hesitating
a
little
,
with
a
rising
sob
of
*NL*
mortification
,
``
necklaces
are
quite
usual
now
;
and
Madame
Poincon
,
who
*NL*
was
stricter
in
some
things
even
than
you
are
,
used
to
wear
ornaments
.
*NL*
And
Christians
generally
--
surely
there
are
women
in
heaven
now
who
wore
*NL*
jewels
.
''
Celia
was
conscious
of
some
mental
strength
when
she
really
*NL*
applied
herself
to
argument
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
would
like
to
wear
them
?
''
exclaimed
Dorothea
,
an
air
of
astonished
*NL*
discovery
animating
her
whole
person
with
a
dramatic
action
which
she
*NL*
had
caught
from
that
very
Madame
Poincon
who
wore
the
ornaments
.
``
Of
*NL*
course
,
then
,
let
us
have
them
out
.
Why
did
you
not
tell
me
before
?
*NL*
But
the
keys
,
the
keys
!
''
She
pressed
her
hands
against
the
sides
of
her
*NL*
head
and
seemed
to
despair
of
her
memory
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
here
,
''
said
Celia
,
with
whom
this
explanation
had
been
long
*NL*
meditated
and
prearranged
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pray
open
the
large
drawer
of
the
cabinet
and
get
out
the
jewel-box
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
casket
was
soon
open
before
them
,
and
the
various
jewels
spread
*NL*
out
,
making
a
bright
parterre
on
the
table
.
It
was
no
great
*NL*
collection
,
but
a
few
of
the
ornaments
were
really
of
remarkable
*NL*
beauty
,
the
finest
that
was
obvious
at
first
being
a
necklace
of
purple
*NL*
amethysts
set
in
exquisite
gold
work
,
and
a
pearl
cross
with
five
*NL*
brilliants
in
it
.
Dorothea
immediately
took
up
the
necklace
and
*NL*
fastened
it
round
her
sister
's
neck
,
where
it
fitted
almost
as
closely
*NL*
as
a
bracelet
;
but
the
circle
suited
the
Henrietta-Maria
style
of
*NL*
Celia
's
head
and
neck
,
and
she
could
see
that
it
did
,
in
the
pier-glass
*NL*
opposite
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
Celia
!
you
can
wear
that
with
your
Indian
muslin
.
But
this
*NL*
cross
you
must
wear
with
your
dark
dresses
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Celia
was
trying
not
to
smile
with
pleasure
.
``
O
Dodo
,
you
must
keep
*NL*
the
cross
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
dear
,
no
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
putting
up
her
hand
with
careless
*NL*
deprecation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
indeed
you
must
;
it
would
suit
you
--
in
your
black
dress
,
now
,
''
*NL*
said
Celia
,
insistingly
.
``
You
_
might
_
wear
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
for
the
world
,
not
for
the
world
.
A
cross
is
the
last
thing
I
*NL*
would
wear
as
a
trinket
.
''
Dorothea
shuddered
slightly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
will
think
it
wicked
in
me
to
wear
it
,
''
said
Celia
,
uneasily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
dear
,
no
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
stroking
her
sister
's
cheek
.
``
Souls
*NL*
have
complexions
too
:
what
will
suit
one
will
not
suit
another
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
might
like
to
keep
it
for
mamma
's
sake
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
have
other
things
of
mamma
's
--
her
sandal-wood
box
which
I
am
so
*NL*
fond
of
--
plenty
of
things
.
In
fact
,
they
are
all
yours
,
dear
.
We
need
*NL*
discuss
them
no
longer
.
There
--
take
away
your
property
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Celia
felt
a
little
hurt
.
There
was
a
strong
assumption
of
superiority
*NL*
in
this
Puritanic
toleration
,
hardly
less
trying
to
the
blond
flesh
of
*NL*
an
unenthusiastic
sister
than
a
Puritanic
persecution
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
how
can
I
wear
ornaments
if
you
,
who
are
the
elder
sister
,
will
*NL*
never
wear
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
Celia
,
that
is
too
much
to
ask
,
that
I
should
wear
trinkets
to
*NL*
keep
you
in
countenance
.
If
I
were
to
put
on
such
a
necklace
as
that
,
*NL*
I
should
feel
as
if
I
had
been
pirouetting
.
The
world
would
go
round
*NL*
with
me
,
and
I
should
not
know
how
to
walk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Celia
had
unclasped
the
necklace
and
drawn
it
off
.
``
It
would
be
a
*NL*
little
tight
for
your
neck
;
something
to
lie
down
and
hang
would
suit
*NL*
you
better
,
''
she
said
,
with
some
satisfaction
.
The
complete
unfitness
*NL*
of
the
necklace
from
all
points
of
view
for
Dorothea
,
made
Celia
*NL*
happier
in
taking
it
.
She
was
opening
some
ring-boxes
,
which
disclosed
*NL*
a
fine
emerald
with
diamonds
,
and
just
then
the
sun
passing
beyond
a
*NL*
cloud
sent
a
bright
gleam
over
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
very
beautiful
these
gems
are
!
''
said
Dorothea
,
under
a
new
current
*NL*
of
feeling
,
as
sudden
as
the
gleam
.
``
It
is
strange
how
deeply
colors
*NL*
seem
to
penetrate
one
,
like
scent
.
I
suppose
that
is
the
reason
why
*NL*
gems
are
used
as
spiritual
emblems
in
the
Revelation
of
St.
John
.
They
*NL*
look
like
fragments
of
heaven
.
I
think
that
emerald
is
more
beautiful
*NL*
than
any
of
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
there
is
a
bracelet
to
match
it
,
''
said
Celia
.
``
We
did
not
notice
*NL*
this
at
first
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
lovely
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
slipping
the
ring
and
bracelet
on
her
*NL*
finely
turned
finger
and
wrist
,
and
holding
them
towards
the
window
on
*NL*
a
level
with
her
eyes
.
All
the
while
her
thought
was
trying
to
justify
*NL*
her
delight
in
the
colors
by
merging
them
in
her
mystic
religious
joy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
_
would
_
like
those
,
Dorothea
,
''
said
Celia
,
rather
falteringly
,
*NL*
beginning
to
think
with
wonder
that
her
sister
showed
some
weakness
,
*NL*
and
also
that
emeralds
would
suit
her
own
complexion
even
better
than
*NL*
purple
amethysts
.
``
You
must
keep
that
ring
and
bracelet
--
if
nothing
*NL*
else
.
But
see
,
these
agates
are
very
pretty
and
quiet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
!
I
will
keep
these
--
this
ring
and
bracelet
,
''
said
Dorothea
.
*NL*
Then
,
letting
her
hand
fall
on
the
table
,
she
said
in
another
*NL*
tone
--
``
Yet
what
miserable
men
find
such
things
,
and
work
at
them
,
and
*NL*
sell
them
!
''
She
paused
again
,
and
Celia
thought
that
her
sister
was
*NL*
going
to
renounce
the
ornaments
,
as
in
consistency
she
ought
to
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
dear
,
I
will
keep
these
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
decidedly
.
``
But
take
*NL*
all
the
rest
away
,
and
the
casket
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
took
up
her
pencil
without
removing
the
jewels
,
and
still
looking
*NL*
at
them
.
She
thought
of
often
having
them
by
her
,
to
feed
her
eye
at
*NL*
these
little
fountains
of
pure
color
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
you
wear
them
in
company
?
''
said
Celia
,
who
was
watching
her
with
*NL*
real
curiosity
as
to
what
she
would
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
glanced
quickly
at
her
sister
.
Across
all
her
imaginative
*NL*
adornment
of
those
whom
she
loved
,
there
darted
now
and
then
a
keen
*NL*
discernment
,
which
was
not
without
a
scorching
quality
.
If
Miss
Brooke
*NL*
ever
attained
perfect
meekness
,
it
would
not
be
for
lack
of
inward
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
,
''
she
said
,
rather
haughtily
.
``
I
can
not
tell
to
what
level
I
*NL*
may
sink
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Celia
blushed
,
and
was
unhappy
:
she
saw
that
she
had
offended
her
*NL*
sister
,
and
dared
not
say
even
anything
pretty
about
the
gift
of
the
*NL*
ornaments
which
she
put
back
into
the
box
and
carried
away
.
Dorothea
*NL*
too
was
unhappy
,
as
she
went
on
with
her
plan-drawing
,
questioning
the
*NL*
purity
of
her
own
feeling
and
speech
in
the
scene
which
had
ended
with
*NL*
that
little
explosion
.
*NL*
*NL*
Celia
's
consciousness
told
her
that
she
had
not
been
at
all
in
the
*NL*
wrong
:
it
was
quite
natural
and
justifiable
that
she
should
have
asked
*NL*
that
question
,
and
she
repeated
to
herself
that
Dorothea
was
*NL*
inconsistent
:
either
she
should
have
taken
her
full
share
of
the
*NL*
jewels
,
or
,
after
what
she
had
said
,
she
should
have
renounced
them
*NL*
altogether
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sure
--
at
least
,
I
trust
,
''
thought
Celia
,
``
that
the
wearing
of
a
*NL*
necklace
will
not
interfere
with
my
prayers
.
And
I
do
not
see
that
I
*NL*
should
be
bound
by
Dorothea
's
opinions
now
we
are
going
into
society
,
*NL*
though
of
course
she
herself
ought
to
be
bound
by
them
.
But
Dorothea
*NL*
is
not
always
consistent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
Celia
,
mutely
bending
over
her
tapestry
,
until
she
heard
her
*NL*
sister
calling
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
,
Kitty
,
come
and
look
at

As
Celia
bent
over
the
paper
,
Dorothea
put
her
cheek
against
her
*NL*
sister
's
arm
caressingly
.
Celia
understood
the
action
.
Dorothea
saw
*NL*
that
she
had
been
in
the
wrong
,
and
Celia
pardoned
her
.
Since
they
*NL*
could
remember
,
there
had
been
a
mixture
of
criticism
and
awe
in
the
*NL*
attitude
of
Celia
's
mind
towards
her
elder
sister
.
The
younger
had
*NL*
always
worn
a
yoke
;

is
there
any
yoked
creature
without
its
private

opinions

``
Sir
Humphry
Davy
?
''
said
Mr.
Brooke
,
over
the
soup
,
in
his
easy
smiling
*NL*
way
,
taking
up
Sir
James
Chettam
's
remark
that
he
was
studying
Davy
's
*NL*
Agricultural
Chemistry
.
``
Well
,
now
,
Sir
Humphry
Davy
;
I
dined
with
him
*NL*
years
ago
at
Cartwright
's
,
and
Wordsworth
was
there
too
--
the
poet
*NL*
Wordsworth
,
you
know
.
Now
there
was
something
singular
.
I
was
at
*NL*
Cambridge
when
Wordsworth
was
there
,
and
I
never
met
him
--
and
I
dined
*NL*
with
him
twenty
years
afterwards
at
Cartwright
's
.
There
's
an
oddity
in
*NL*
things
,
now
.
But
Davy
was
there
:
he
was
a
poet
too
.
Or
,
as
I
may
say
,
*NL*
Wordsworth
was
poet
one
,
and
Davy
was
poet
two
.
That
was
true
in
every
*NL*
sense
,
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
felt
a
little
more
uneasy
than
usual
.
In
the
beginning
of
*NL*
dinner
,
the
party
being
small
and
the
room
still
,
these
motes
from
the
*NL*
mass
of
a
magistrate
's
mind
fell
too
noticeably
.
She
wondered
how
a
*NL*
man
like
Mr.
Casaubon
would
support
such
triviality
.
His
manners
,
she
*NL*
thought
,
were
very
dignified
;
the
set
of
his
iron-gray
hair
and
his
*NL*
deep
eye-sockets
made
him
resemble
the
portrait
of
Locke
.
He
had
the
*NL*
spare
form
and
the
pale
complexion
which
became
a
student
;
as
different
*NL*
as
possible
from
the
blooming
Englishman
of
the
red-whiskered
type
*NL*
represented
by
Sir
James
Chettam
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
reading
the
Agricultural
Chemistry
,
''
said
this
excellent
baronet
,
*NL*
``
because
I
am
going
to
take
one
of
the
farms
into
my
own
hands
,
and
see
*NL*
if
something
can
not
be
done
in
setting
a
good
pattern
of
farming
among
*NL*
my
tenants
.
Do
you
approve
of
that
,
Miss
Brooke
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
great
mistake
,
Chettam
,
''
interposed
Mr.
Brooke
,
``
going
into
*NL*
electrifying
your
land
and
that
kind
of
thing
,
and
making
a
parlor
of
*NL*
your
cow-house
.
It
wo
n't
do
.
I
went
into
science
a
great
deal
myself
*NL*
at
one
time
;
but
I
saw
it
would
not
do
.
It
leads
to
everything
;
you
*NL*
can
let
nothing
alone
.
No
,
no
--
see
that
your
tenants
do
n't
sell
their
*NL*
straw
,
and
that
kind
of
thing
;
and
give
them
draining-tiles
,
you
know
.
*NL*
But
your
fancy
farming
will
not
do
--
the
most
expensive
sort
of
whistle
*NL*
you
can
buy
:
you
may
as
well
keep
a
pack
of
hounds
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Surely
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
``
it
is
better
to
spend
money
in
finding
out
*NL*
how
men
can
make
the
most
of
the
land
which
supports
them
all
,
than
in
*NL*
keeping
dogs
and
horses
only
to
gallop
over
it
.
It
is
not
a
sin
to
*NL*
make
yourself
poor
in
performing
experiments
for
the
good
of
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
spoke
with
more
energy
than
is
expected
of
so
young
a
lady
,
but
Sir
*NL*
James
had
appealed
to
her
.
He
was
accustomed
to
do
so
,
and
she
had
*NL*
often
thought
that
she
could
urge
him
to
many
good
actions
when
he
was
*NL*
her
brother-in-law
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Casaubon
turned
his
eyes
very
markedly
on
Dorothea
while
she
was
*NL*
speaking
,
and
seemed
to
observe
her
newly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Young
ladies
do
n't
understand
political
economy
,
you
know
,
''
said
Mr.
*NL*
Brooke
,
smiling
towards
Mr.
Casaubon
.
``
I
remember
when
we
were
all
*NL*
reading
Adam
Smith
.
_
There
_
is
a
book
,
now
.
I
took
in
all
the
new
*NL*
ideas
at
one
time
--
human
perfectibility
,
now
.
But
some
say
,
history
*NL*
moves
in
circles
;
and
that
may
be
very
well
argued
;
I
have
argued
it
*NL*
myself
.
The
fact
is
,
human
reason
may
carry
you
a
little
too
far
--
over
*NL*
the
hedge
,
in
fact
.
It
carried
me
a
good
way
at
one
time
;
but
I
saw
it
*NL*
would
not
do
.
I
pulled
up
;
I
pulled
up
in
time
.
But
not
too
hard
.
I
*NL*
have
always
been
in
favor
of
a
little
theory
:
we
must
have
Thought
;
*NL*
else
we
shall
be
landed
back
in
the
dark
ages
.
But
talking
of
books
,
*NL*
there
is
Southey
's
`
Peninsular
War
.
'
I
am
reading
that
of
a
morning
.
*NL*
You
know
Southey
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
''
said
Mr.
Casaubon
,
not
keeping
pace
with
Mr.
Brooke
's
impetuous
*NL*
reason
,
and
thinking
of
the
book
only
.
``
I
have
little
leisure
for
such
*NL*
literature
just
now
.
I
have
been
using
up
my
eyesight
on
old
*NL*
characters
lately
;
the
fact
is
,
I
want
a
reader
for
my
evenings
;
but
I
*NL*
am
fastidious
in
voices
,
and
I
can
not
endure
listening
to
an
imperfect
*NL*
reader
.
It
is
a
misfortune
,
in
some
senses
:
I
feed
too
much
on
the
*NL*
inward
sources
;
I
live
too
much
with
the
dead
.
My
mind
is
something
*NL*
like
the
ghost
of
an
ancient
,
wandering
about
the
world
and
trying
*NL*
mentally
to
construct
it
as
it
used
to
be
,
in
spite
of
ruin
and
*NL*
confusing
changes
.
But
I
find
it
necessary
to
use
the
utmost
caution
*NL*
about
my
eyesight
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
first
time
that
Mr.
Casaubon
had
spoken
at
any
length
.
He
*NL*
delivered
himself
with
precision
,
as
if
he
had
been
called
upon
to
make
*NL*
a
public
statement
;
and
the
balanced
sing-song
neatness
of
his
speech
,
*NL*
occasionally
corresponded
to
by
a
movement
of
his
head
,
was
the
more
*NL*
conspicuous
from
its
contrast
with
good
Mr.
Brooke
's
scrappy
*NL*
slovenliness
.
Dorothea
said
to
herself
that
Mr.
Casaubon
was
the
most
*NL*
interesting
man
she
had
ever
seen
,
not
excepting
even
Monsieur
Liret
,
*NL*
the
Vaudois
clergyman
who
had
given
conferences
on
the
history
of
the
*NL*
Waldenses
.
To
reconstruct
a
past
world
,
doubtless
with
a
view
to
the
*NL*
highest
purposes
of
truth
--
what
a
work
to
be
in
any
way
present
at
,
to
*NL*
assist
in
,
though
only
as
a
lamp-holder
!
This
elevating
thought
lifted
*NL*
her
above
her
annoyance
at
being
twitted
with
her
ignorance
of
*NL*
political
economy
,
that
never-explained
science
which
was
thrust
as
an
*NL*
extinguisher
over
all
her
lights
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
are
fond
of
riding
,
Miss
Brooke
,
''
Sir
James
presently
took
an
*NL*
opportunity
of
saying
.
``
I
should
have
thought
you
would
enter
a
little
*NL*
into
the
pleasures
of
hunting
.
I
wish
you
would
let
me
send
over
a
*NL*
chestnut
horse
for
you
to
try
.
It
has
been
trained
for
a
lady
.
I
saw
*NL*
you
on
Saturday
cantering
over
the
hill
on
a
nag
not
worthy
of
you
.
My
*NL*
groom
shall
bring
Corydon
for
you
every
day
,
if
you
will
only
mention
*NL*
the
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
you
are
very
good
.
I
mean
to
give
up
riding
.
I
shall
not
*NL*
ride
any
more
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
urged
to
this
brusque
resolution
by
a
*NL*
little
annoyance
that
Sir
James
would
be
soliciting
her
attention
when
*NL*
she
wanted
to
give
it
all
to
Mr.
Casaubon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
that
is
too
hard
,
''
said
Sir
James
,
in
a
tone
of
reproach
that
*NL*
showed
strong
interest
.
``
Your
sister
is
given
to
self-mortification
,
*NL*
is
she
not
?
''
he
continued
,
turning
to
Celia
,
who
sat
at
his
right
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
she
is
,
''
said
Celia
,
feeling
afraid
lest
she
should
say
*NL*
something
that
would
not
please
her
sister
,
and
blushing
as
prettily
as
*NL*
possible
above
her
necklace
.
``
She
likes
giving
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
that
were
true
,
Celia
,
my
giving-up
would
be
self-indulgence
,
not
*NL*
self-mortification
.
But
there
may
be
good
reasons
for
choosing
not
to
*NL*
do
what
is
very
agreeable
,
''
said
Dorothea
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Brooke
was
speaking
at
the
same
time
,
but
it
was
evident
that
Mr.
*NL*
Casaubon
was
observing
Dorothea
,
and
she
was
aware
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Exactly
,
''
said
Sir
James
.
``
You
give
up
from
some
high
,
generous
*NL*
motive
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
indeed
,
not
exactly
.
I
did
not
say
that
of
myself
,
''
answered
*NL*
Dorothea
,
reddening
.
Unlike
Celia
,
she
rarely
blushed
,
and
only
from
*NL*
high
delight
or
anger
.
At
this
moment
she
felt
angry
with
the
perverse
*NL*
Sir
James
.
Why
did
he
not
pay
attention
to
Celia
,
and
leave
her
to
*NL*
listen
to
Mr.
Casaubon
?
--
if
that
learned
man
would
only
talk
,
instead
*NL*
of
allowing
himself
to
be
talked
to
by
Mr.
Brooke
,
who
was
just
then
*NL*
informing
him
that
the
Reformation
either
meant
something
or
it
did
*NL*
not
,
that
he
himself
was
a
Protestant
to
the
core
,
but
that
Catholicism
*NL*
was
a
fact
;
and
as
to
refusing
an
acre
of
your
ground
for
a
Romanist
*NL*
chapel
,
all
men
needed
the
bridle
of
religion
,
which
,
properly
*NL*
speaking
,
was
the
dread
of
a
Hereafter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
made
a
great
study
of
theology
at
one
time
,
''
said
Mr.
Brooke
,
as
if
*NL*
to
explain
the
insight
just
manifested
.
``
I
know
something
of
all
*NL*
schools
.
I
knew
Wilberforce
in
his
best
days
.
Do
you
know

Wilberforce

*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Casaubon
said
,
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Wilberforce
was
perhaps
not
enough
of
a
thinker
;
but
if
I
went
*NL*
into
Parliament

as
I
have
been
asked
to
do
,
I
should
sit
on
the
*NL*
independent
bench
,
as
Wilberforce
did
,
and
work
at
philanthropy

*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Casaubon
bowed
,
and
observed
that
it
was
a
wide
field
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Mr.
Brooke
,
with
an
easy
smile
,
``
but
I
have
documents

began
a
long
while
ago

want
arranging

*NL*
when
a
question
has
struck
me
,
I
have
written
to
somebody
and
got
an
*NL*
answer
.
I
have
documents
at
my
back

But
now
,
how
do
you
arrange
your
*NL*
documents

*NL*
*NL*
``
In
pigeon-holes
partly
,

said
Mr.
Casaubon
,
with
rather
a
startled
air
*NL*
of
effort
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
pigeon-holes
will
not
do
.
I
have
tried
pigeon-holes
,
but
*NL*
everything
gets
mixed
in
pigeon-holes
:
I
never
know
whether
a
paper
is
*NL*
in
A
or
Z.

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
you
would
let
me
sort
your
papers
for
you

said
*NL*
Dorothea
.
``
I
would
letter
them
all
,
and
then
make
a
list
of
subjects
*NL*
under
each
letter

*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Casaubon
gravely
smiled
approval
,
and
said
to
Mr.
Brooke
,
``
You
have
*NL*
an
excellent
secretary
at
hand
,
you
perceive

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

no

said
Mr.
Brooke
,
shaking
his
head
;
``
I
can
not
let

*NL*
meddle
with
my
documents
.
Young
ladies
are
too
flighty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
felt
hurt
.
Mr.
Casaubon
would
think
that
her
uncle
had
some
*NL*
special
reason
for
delivering
this
opinion
,
whereas
the
remark
lay
in
*NL*
his
mind
as
lightly
as
the
broken
wing
of
an
insect
among
all
the
other
*NL*
fragments
there
,
and
a
chance
current
had
sent
it
alighting
on
_
her
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
two
girls
were
in
the
drawing-room
alone
,
Celia
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``

very
ugly
Mr.

*NL*
*NL*
``

``

,
walking
away
a
little
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Casaubon
is
so
sallow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
the
better

I
suppose
you
admire

*NL*
*NL*
``
Dodo

''
exclaimed
Celia
,
looking
after
her
in
surprise
.
``
I
never
heard
*NL*
you
make
such
a
comparison
before
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
should
I
make
it
before
the
occasion
came
?
It
is
a
good
*NL*
comparison
:
the
match
is
perfect
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Brooke
was
clearly
forgetting
herself
,
and
Celia
thought
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wonder
you
show
temper
,
Dorothea

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
so
painful
in
you
,
Celia
,
that
you
will
look
at
human
beings
as
*NL*
if
they
were
merely
animals
with
a
toilet
,
and
never
see
the
great
soul
*NL*
in
a
man
's
face
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
Mr.
Casaubon
a
great
soul
?
''
Celia
was
not
without
a
touch
of
naive
*NL*
malice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
believe
he
has
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
with
the
full
voice
of
*NL*
decision
.
``
Everything
I
see
in
him
corresponds
to
his
pamphlet
on
*NL*
Biblical
Cosmology
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
talks
very
little
,
''
said
Celia
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
no
one
for
him
to
talk
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Celia
thought
privately
,
``
Dorothea
quite
despises
Sir
James
Chettam
;
I
*NL*
believe
she
would
not
accept
him
.
''
Celia
felt
that
this
was
a
pity
.
*NL*
She
had
never
been
deceived
as
to
the
object
of
the
baronet
's
interest
.
*NL*
Sometimes
,
indeed
,
she
had
reflected
that
Dodo
would
perhaps
not
make
a
*NL*
husband
happy
who
had
not
her
way
of
looking
at
things
;
and
stifled
in
*NL*
the
depths
of
her
heart
was
the
feeling
that
her
sister
was
too
*NL*
religious
for
family
comfort
.
Notions
and
scruples
were
like
spilt
*NL*
needles
,
making
one
afraid
of
treading
,
or
sitting
down
,
or
even
eating
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Miss
Brooke
was
at
the
tea-table
,
Sir
James
came
to
sit
down
by
*NL*
her
,
not
having
felt
her
mode
of
answering
him
at
all
offensive
.
Why
*NL*
should
he
?
He
thought
it
probable
that
Miss
Brooke
liked
him
,
and
*NL*
manners
must
be
very
marked
indeed
before
they
cease
to
be
interpreted
*NL*
by
preconceptions
either
confident
or
distrustful
.
She
was
thoroughly
*NL*
charming
to
him
,
but
of
course
he
theorized
a
little
about
his
*NL*
attachment
.
He
was
made
of
excellent
human
dough
,
and
had
the
rare
*NL*
merit
of
knowing
that
his
talents
,
even
if
let
loose
,
would
not
set
the
*NL*
smallest
stream
in
the
county
on
fire
:
hence
he
liked
the
prospect
of
a
*NL*
wife
to
whom
he
could
say
,
``
What
shall
we
do
?
''
about
this
or
that
;
who
*NL*
could
help
her
husband
out
with
reasons
,
and
would
also
have
the
*NL*
property
qualification
for
doing
so
.
As
to
the
excessive
religiousness
*NL*
alleged
against
Miss
Brooke
,
he
had
a
very
indefinite
notion
of
what
it
*NL*
consisted
in
,
and
thought
that
it
would
die
out
with
marriage
.
In
*NL*
short
,
he
felt
himself
to
be
in
love
in
the
right
place
,
and
was
ready
*NL*
to
endure
a
great
deal
of
predominance
,
which
,
after
all
,
a
man
could
*NL*
always
put
down
when
he
liked
.
Sir
James
had
no
idea
that
he
should
*NL*
ever
like
to
put
down
the
predominance
of
this
handsome
girl
,
in
whose
*NL*
cleverness
he
delighted
.
Why
not
?
A
man
's
mind
--
what
there
is
of
*NL*
it
--
has
always
the
advantage
of
being
masculine
,
--
as
the
smallest
*NL*
birch-tree
is
of
a
higher
kind
than
the
most
soaring
palm
,
--
and
even
*NL*
his
ignorance
is
of
a
sounder
quality
.
Sir
James
might
not
have
*NL*
originated
this
estimate
;
but
a
kind
Providence
furnishes
the
limpest
*NL*
personality
with
a
little
gum
or
starch
in
the
form
of
tradition
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
hope
that
you
will
rescind
that
resolution
about
the
horse
,
*NL*
Miss
Brooke
,
''
said
the
persevering
admirer
.
``
I
assure
you
,
riding
is
*NL*
the
most
healthy
of
exercises
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
aware
of
it
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
coldly
.
``
I
think
it
would
do
Celia
*NL*
good
--
if
she
would
take
to
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
are
such
a
perfect
horsewoman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excuse
me
;
I
have
had
very
little
practice
,
and
I
should
be
easily
*NL*
thrown
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
that
is
a
reason
for
more
practice
.
Every
lady
ought
to
be
a
*NL*
perfect
horsewoman
,
that
she
may
accompany
her
husband
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
how
widely
we
differ
,
Sir
James
.
I
have
made
up
my
mind
that
*NL*
I
ought
not
to
be
a
perfect
horsewoman
,
and
so
I
should
never
*NL*
correspond
to
your
pattern
of
a
lady
.
''
Dorothea
looked
straight
before
*NL*
her
,
and
spoke
with
cold
brusquerie
,
very
much
with
the
air
of
a
*NL*
handsome
boy
,
in
amusing
contrast
with
the
solicitous
amiability
of
her
*NL*
admirer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
like
to
know
your
reasons
for
this
cruel
resolution
.
It
is
*NL*
not
possible
that
you
should
think
horsemanship
wrong
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
quite
possible
that
I
should
think
it
wrong
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
why
?
''
said
Sir
James
,
in
a
tender
tone
of
remonstrance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Casaubon
had
come
up
to
the
table
,
teacup
in
hand
,
and
was
*NL*
listening
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
must
not
inquire
too
curiously
into
motives
,
''
he
interposed
,
in
his
*NL*
measured
way
.
``
Miss
Brooke
knows
that
they
are
apt
to
become
feeble
in
*NL*
the
utterance
:
the
aroma
is
mixed
with
the
grosser
air
.
We
must
keep
*NL*
the
germinating
grain
away
from
the
light
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
colored
with
pleasure
,
and
looked
up
gratefully
to
the
*NL*
speaker
.
Here
was
a
man
who
could
understand
the
higher
inward
life
,
*NL*
and
with
whom
there
could
be
some
spiritual
communion
;
nay
,
who
could
*NL*
illuminate
principle
with
the
widest
knowledge
a
man
whose
learning
*NL*
almost
amounted
to
a
proof
of
whatever
he
believed
!
*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
's
inferences
may
seem
large
;
but
really
life
could
never
have
*NL*
gone
on
at
any
period
but
for
this
liberal
allowance
of
conclusions
,
*NL*
which
has
facilitated
marriage
under
the
difficulties
of
civilization
.
*NL*
Has
any
one
ever
pinched
into
its
pilulous
smallness
the
cobweb
of
*NL*
pre-matrimonial
acquaintanceship
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
,
''
said
good
Sir
James
.
``
Miss
Brooke
shall
not
be
urged
to
*NL*
tell
reasons
she
would
rather
be
silent
upon
.
I
am
sure
her
reasons
*NL*
would
do
her
honor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
not
in
the
least
jealous
of
the
interest
with
which
Dorothea
had
*NL*
looked
up
at
Mr.
Casaubon
:
it
never
occurred
to
him
that
a
girl
to
whom
*NL*
he
was
meditating
an
offer
of
marriage
could
care
for
a
dried
bookworm
*NL*
towards
fifty
,
except
,
indeed
,
in
a
religious
sort
of
way
,
as
for
a
*NL*
clergyman
of
some
distinction
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
since
Miss
Brooke
had
become
engaged
in
a
conversation
with
*NL*
Mr.
Casaubon
about
the
Vaudois
clergy
,
Sir
James
betook
himself
to
*NL*
Celia
,
and
talked
to
her
about
her
sister
;
spoke
of
a
house
in
town
,
*NL*
and
asked
whether
Miss
Brooke
disliked
London
.
Away
from
her
sister
,
*NL*
Celia
talked
quite
easily
,
and
Sir
James
said
to
himself
that
the
*NL*
second
Miss
Brooke
was
certainly
very
agreeable
as
well
as
pretty
,
*NL*
though
not
,
as
some
people
pretended
,
more
clever
and
sensible
than
the
*NL*
elder
sister
.
He
felt
that
he
had
chosen
the
one
who
was
in
all
*NL*
respects
the
superior
;
and
a
man
naturally
likes
to
look
forward
to
*NL*
having
the
best
.
He
would
be
the
very
Mawworm
of
bachelors
who
*NL*
pretended
not
to
expect
it
.

If
it
had
really
occurred
to
Mr.
Casaubon
to
think
of
Miss
Brooke
as
a
*NL*
suitable
wife
for
him
,
the
reasons
that
might
induce
her
to
accept
him
*NL*
were
already
planted
in
her
mind
,
and
by
the
evening
of
the
next
day
*NL*
the
reasons
had
budded
and
bloomed
.
For
they
had
had
a
long
*NL*
conversation
in
the
morning
,
while
Celia
,
who
did
not
like
the
company
*NL*
of
Mr.
Casaubon
's
moles
and
sallowness
,
had
escaped
to
the
vicarage
to
*NL*
play
with
the
curate
's
ill-shod
but
merry
children
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
by
this
time
had
looked
deep
into
the
ungauged
reservoir
of
*NL*
Mr.
Casaubon
's
mind
,
seeing
reflected
there
in
vague
labyrinthine
*NL*
extension
every
quality
she
herself
brought
;
had
opened
much
of
her
own
*NL*
experience
to
him
,
and
had
understood
from
him
the
scope
of
his
great
*NL*
work
,
also
of
attractively
labyrinthine
extent
.
For
he
had
been
as
*NL*
instructive
as
Milton
's
``
affable
archangel
;
''
and
with
something
of
the
*NL*
archangelic
manner
he
told
her
how
he
had
undertaken
to
show
-LRB-
what
*NL*
indeed
had
been
attempted
before
,
but
not
with
that
thoroughness
,
*NL*
justice
of
comparison
,
and
effectiveness
of
arrangement
at
which
Mr.
*NL*
Casaubon
aimed
-RRB-
that
all
the
mythical
systems
or
erratic
mythical
*NL*
fragments
in
the
world
were
corruptions
of
a
tradition
originally
*NL*
revealed
.
Having
once
mastered
the
true
position
and
taken
a
firm
*NL*
footing
there
,
the
vast
field
of
mythical
constructions
became
*NL*
intelligible
,
nay
,
luminous
with
the
reflected
light
of
*NL*
correspondences
.
But
to
gather
in
this
great
harvest
of
truth
was
no
*NL*
light
or
speedy
work
.
His
notes
already
made
a
formidable
range
of
*NL*
volumes
,
but
the
crowning
task
would
be
to
condense
these
voluminous
*NL*
still-accumulating
results
and
bring
them
,
like
the
earlier
vintage
of
*NL*
Hippocratic
books
,
to
fit
a
little
shelf
.
In
explaining
this
to
*NL*
Dorothea
,
Mr.
Casaubon
expressed
himself
nearly
as
he
would
have
done
*NL*
to
a
fellow-student
,
for
he
had
not
two
styles
of
talking
at
command
:
*NL*
it
is
true
that
when
he
used
a
Greek
or
Latin
phrase
he
always
gave
the
*NL*
English
with
scrupulous
care
,
but
he
would
probably
have
done
this
in
*NL*
any
case
.
A
learned
provincial
clergyman
is
accustomed
to
think
of
his
*NL*
acquaintances
as
of
``
lords
,
knyghtes
,
and
other
noble
and
worthi
men
,
*NL*
that
conne
Latyn
but
lytille
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
was
altogether
captivated
by
the
wide
embrace
of
this
*NL*
conception
.
Here
was
something
beyond
the
shallows
of
ladies
'
school
*NL*
literature
:
here
was
a
living
Bossuet
,
whose
work
would
reconcile
*NL*
complete
knowledge
with
devoted
piety
;
here
was
a
modern
Augustine
who
*NL*
united
the
glories
of
doctor
and
saint
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sanctity
seemed
no
less
clearly
marked
than
the
learning
,
for
when
*NL*
Dorothea
was
impelled
to
open
her
mind
on
certain
themes
which
she
*NL*
could
speak
of
to
no
one
whom
she
had
before
seen
at
Tipton
,
especially
*NL*
on
the
secondary
importance
of
ecclesiastical
forms
and
articles
of
*NL*
belief
compared
with
that
spiritual
religion
,
that
submergence
of
self
*NL*
in
communion
with
Divine
perfection
which
seemed
to
her
to
be
expressed
*NL*
in
the
best
Christian
books
of
widely
distant
ages
,
she
found
in
Mr.
*NL*
Casaubon
a
listener
who
understood
her
at
once
,
who
could
assure
her
of
*NL*
his
own
agreement
with
that
view
when
duly
tempered
with
wise
*NL*
conformity
,
and
could
mention
historical
examples
before
unknown
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
thinks
with
me
,
''
said
Dorothea
to
herself
,
``
or
rather
,
he
thinks
a
*NL*
whole
world
of
which
my
thought
is
but
a
poor
twopenny
mirror
.
And
his
*NL*
feelings
too
,
his
whole
experience
--
what
a
lake
compared
with
my
little
*NL*
pool
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Brooke
argued
from
words
and
dispositions
not
less
unhesitatingly
*NL*
than
other
young
ladies
of
her
age
.
Signs
are
small
measurable
things
,
*NL*
but
interpretations
are
illimitable
,
and
in
girls
of
sweet
,
ardent
*NL*
nature
,
every
sign
is
apt
to
conjure
up
wonder
,
hope
,
belief
,
vast
as
a
*NL*
sky
,
and
colored
by
a
diffused
thimbleful
of
matter
in
the
shape
of
*NL*
knowledge
.
They
are
not
always
too
grossly
deceived
;
for
Sinbad
*NL*
himself
may
have
fallen
by
good-luck
on
a
true
description
,
and
wrong
*NL*
reasoning
sometimes
lands
poor
mortals
in
right
conclusions
:
starting
a
*NL*
long
way
off
the
true
point
,
and
proceeding
by
loops
and
zigzags
,
we
*NL*
now
and
then
arrive
just
where
we
ought
to
be
.
Because
Miss
Brooke
was
*NL*
hasty
in
her
trust
,
it
is
not
therefore
clear
that
Mr.
Casaubon
was
*NL*
unworthy
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
stayed
a
little
longer
than
he
had
intended
,
on
a
slight
pressure
of
*NL*
invitation
from
Mr.
Brooke
,
who
offered
no
bait
except
his
own
*NL*
documents
on
machine-breaking
and
rick-burning
.
Mr.
Casaubon
was
called
*NL*
into
the
library
to
look
at
these
in
a
heap
,
while
his
host
picked
up
*NL*
first
one
and
then
the
other
to
read
aloud
from
in
a
skipping
and
*NL*
uncertain
way
,
passing
from
one
unfinished
passage
to
another
with
a
*NL*
``
Yes
,
now
,
but
here
!
''
and
finally
pushing
them
all
aside
to
open
the
*NL*
journal
of
his
youthful
Continental

Mr.
Brooke
wound
up
,
rubbing
his
thumb
*NL*
transversely
along
the
edges
of
the
leaves
as
he
held
the
book
forward
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Casaubon
made
a
dignified
though
somewhat
sad
audience
;
bowed
in
*NL*
the
right
place
,
and
avoided
looking
at
anything
documentary
as
far
as
*NL*
possible
,
without
showing
disregard
or
impatience
;
mindful
that
this
*NL*
desultoriness
was
associated
with
the
institutions
of
the
country
,
and
*NL*
that
the
man
who
took
him
on
this
severe
mental
scamper
was
not
only
an
*NL*
amiable
host
,
but
a
landholder
and
custos
rotulorum
.
Was
his
endurance
*NL*
aided
also
by
the
reflection
that
Mr.
Brooke
was
the
uncle
of
Dorothea
?
*NL*
*NL*
Certainly
he
seemed
more
and
more
bent
on
making
her
talk
to
him
,
on
*NL*
drawing
her
out
,
as
Celia
remarked
to
herself
;
and
in
looking
at
her
*NL*
his
face
was
often
lit
up
by
a
smile
like
pale
wintry
sunshine
.
Before
*NL*
he
left
the
next
morning
,
while
taking
a
pleasant
walk
with
Miss
Brooke
*NL*
along
the
gravelled
terrace
,
he
had
mentioned
to
her
that
he
felt
the
*NL*
disadvantage
of
loneliness
,
the
need
of
that
cheerful
companionship
*NL*
with
which
the
presence
of
youth
can
lighten
or
vary
the
serious
toils
*NL*
of
maturity
.
And
he
delivered
this
statement
with
as
much
careful
*NL*
precision
as
if
he
had
been
a
diplomatic
envoy
whose
words
would
be
*NL*
attended
with
results
.
Indeed
,
Mr.
Casaubon
was
not
used
to
expect
*NL*
that
he
should
have
to
repeat
or
revise
his
communications
of
a
*NL*
practical
or
personal
kind
.
The
inclinations
which
he
had
deliberately
*NL*
stated
on
the
2d
of
October
he
would
think
it
enough
to
refer
to
by
the
*NL*
mention
of
that
date
;
judging
by
the
standard
of
his
own
memory
,
which
*NL*
was
a
volume
where
a
vide
supra
could
serve
instead
of
repetitions
,
and
*NL*
not
the
ordinary
long-used
blotting-book
which
only
tells
of
forgotten
*NL*
writing
.
But
in
this
case
Mr.
Casaubon
's
confidence
was
not
likely
to
*NL*
be
falsified
,
for
Dorothea
heard
and
retained
what
he
said
with
the
*NL*
eager
interest
of
a
fresh
young
nature
to
which
every
variety
in
*NL*
experience
is
an
epoch
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
three
o'clock
in
the
beautiful
breezy
autumn
day
when
Mr.
*NL*
Casaubon
drove
off
to
his
Rectory
at
Lowick
,
only
five
miles
from
*NL*
Tipton
;
and
Dorothea
,
who
had
on
her
bonnet
and
shawl
,
hurried
along
*NL*
the
shrubbery
and
across
the
park
that
she
might
wander
through
the
*NL*
bordering
wood
with
no
other
visible
companionship
than
that
of
Monk
,
*NL*
the
Great
St.
Bernard
dog
,
who
always
took
care
of
the
young
ladies
in
*NL*
their
walks
.
There
had
risen
before
her
the
girl
's
vision
of
a
*NL*
possible
future
for
herself
to
which
she
looked
forward
with
trembling
*NL*
hope
,
and
she
wanted
to
wander
on
in
that
visionary
future
without
*NL*
interruption
.
She
walked
briskly
in
the
brisk
air
,
the
color
rose
in
*NL*
her
cheeks
,
and
her
straw
bonnet
-LRB-
which
our
contemporaries
might
look
*NL*
at
with
conjectural
curiosity
as
at
an
obsolete
form
of
basket
-RRB-
fell
a
*NL*
little
backward
.
She
would
perhaps
be
hardly
characterized
enough
if
*NL*
it
were
omitted
that
she
wore
her
brown
hair
flatly
braided
and
coiled
*NL*
behind
so
as
to
expose
the
outline
of
her
head
in
a
daring
manner
at
a
*NL*
time
when
public
feeling
required
the
meagreness
of
nature
to
be
*NL*
dissimulated
by
tall
barricades
of
frizzed
curls
and
bows
,
never
*NL*
surpassed
by
any
great
race
except
the
Feejeean
.
This
was
a
trait
of
*NL*
Miss
Brooke
's
asceticism
.
But
there
was
nothing
of
an
ascetic
's
*NL*
expression
in
her
bright
full
eyes
,
as
she
looked
before
her
,
not
*NL*
consciously
seeing
,
but
absorbing
into
the
intensity
of
her
mood
,
the
*NL*
solemn
glory
of
the
afternoon
with
its
long
swathes
of
light
between
*NL*
the
far-off
rows
of
limes
,
whose
shadows
touched
each
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
people
,
young
or
old
-LRB-
that
is
,
all
people
in
those
ante-reform
*NL*
times
-RRB-
,
would
have
thought
her
an
interesting
object
if
they
had
*NL*
referred
the
glow
in
her
eyes
and
cheeks
to
the
newly
awakened
ordinary
*NL*
images
of
young
love
:
the
illusions
of
Chloe
about
Strephon
have
been
*NL*
sufficiently
consecrated
in
poetry
,
as
the
pathetic
loveliness
of
all
*NL*
spontaneous
trust
ought
to
be
.
Miss
Pippin
adoring
young
Pumpkin
,
and
*NL*
dreaming
along
endless
vistas
of
unwearying
companionship
,
was
a
little
*NL*
drama
which
never
tired
our
fathers
and
mothers
,
and
had
been
put
into
*NL*
all
costumes
.
Let
but
Pumpkin
have
a
figure
which
would
sustain
the
*NL*
disadvantages
of
the
shortwaisted
swallow-tail
,
and
everybody
felt
it
*NL*
not
only
natural
but
necessary
to
the
perfection
of
womanhood
,
that
a
*NL*
sweet
girl
should
be
at
once
convinced
of
his
virtue
,
his
exceptional
*NL*
ability
,
and
above
all
,
his
perfect
sincerity
.
But
perhaps
no
persons
*NL*
then
living
--
certainly
none
in
the
neighborhood
of
Tipton
--
would
have
*NL*
had
a
sympathetic
understanding
for
the
dreams
of
a
girl
whose
notions
*NL*
about
marriage
took
their
color
entirely
from
an
exalted
enthusiasm
*NL*
about
the
ends
of
life
,
an
enthusiasm
which
was
lit
chiefly
by
its
own
*NL*
fire
,
and
included
neither
the
niceties
of
the
trousseau
,
the
pattern
*NL*
of
plate
,
nor
even
the
honors
and
sweet
joys
of
the
blooming
matron
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
had
now
entered
Dorothea
's
mind
that
Mr.
Casaubon
might
wish
to
make
*NL*
her
his
wife
,
and
the
idea
that
he
would
do
so
touched
her
with
a
sort
*NL*
of
reverential
gratitude
.
How
good
of
him
--
nay
,
it
would
be
almost
as
*NL*
if
a
winged
messenger
had
suddenly
stood
beside
her
path
and
held
out
*NL*
his
hand
towards
her
!
For
a
long
while
she
had
been
oppressed
by
the
*NL*
indefiniteness
which
hung
in
her
mind
,
like
a
thick
summer
haze
,
over
*NL*
all
her
desire
to
make
her
life
greatly
effective
.
What
could
she
do
,
*NL*
what
ought
she
to
do
?
--
she
,
hardly
more
than
a
budding
woman
,
but
yet
*NL*
with
an
active
conscience
and
a
great
mental
need
,
not
to
be
satisfied
*NL*
by
a
girlish
instruction
comparable
to
the
nibblings
and
judgments
of
a
*NL*
discursive
mouse
.
With
some
endowment
of
stupidity
and
conceit
,
she
*NL*
might
have
thought
that
a
Christian
young
lady
of
fortune
should
find
*NL*
her
ideal
of
life
in
village
charities
,
patronage
of
the
humbler
*NL*
clergy
,
the
perusal
of
``
Female
Scripture
Characters
,
''
unfolding
the
*NL*
private
experience
of
Sara
under
the
Old
Dispensation
,
and
Dorcas
under
*NL*
the
New
,
and
the
care
of
her
soul
over
her
embroidery
in
her
own
*NL*
boudoir
--
with
a
background
of
prospective
marriage
to
a
man
who
,
if
*NL*
less
strict
than
herself
,
as
being
involved
in
affairs
religiously
*NL*
inexplicable
,
might
be
prayed
for
and
seasonably
exhorted
.
From
such
*NL*
contentment
poor
Dorothea
was
shut
out
.
The
intensity
of
her
religious
*NL*
disposition
,
the
coercion
it
exercised
over
her
life
,
was
but
one
*NL*
aspect
of
a
nature
altogether
ardent
,
theoretic
,
and
intellectually
*NL*
consequent
:
and
with
such
a
nature
struggling
in
the
bands
of
a
narrow
*NL*
teaching
,
hemmed
in
by
a
social
life
which
seemed
nothing
but
a
*NL*
labyrinth
of
petty
courses
,
a
walled-in
maze
of
small
paths
that
led
no
*NL*
whither
,
the
outcome
was
sure
to
strike
others
as
at
once
exaggeration
*NL*
and
inconsistency
.
The
thing
which
seemed
to
her
best
,
she
wanted
to
*NL*
justify
by
the
completest
knowledge
;
and
not
to
live
in
a
pretended
*NL*
admission
of
rules
which
were
never
acted
on
.
Into
this
soul-hunger
as
*NL*
yet
all
her
youthful
passion
was
poured
;
the
union
which
attracted
her
*NL*
was
one
that
would
deliver
her
from
her
girlish
subjection
to
her
own
*NL*
ignorance
,
and
give
her
the
freedom
of
voluntary
submission
to
a
guide
*NL*
who
would
take
her
along
the
grandest
path
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
learn
everything
then
,
''
she
said
to
herself
,
still
walking
*NL*
quickly
along
the
bridle
road
through
the
wood
.
``
It
would
be
my
duty
*NL*
to
study
that
I
might
help
him
the
better
in
his
great
works
.
There
*NL*
would
be
nothing
trivial
about
our
lives
.
Every-day
things
with
us
*NL*
would
mean
the
greatest
things
.
It
would
be
like
marrying
Pascal
.
I
*NL*
should
learn
to
see
the
truth
by
the
same
light
as
great
men
have
seen
*NL*
it
by
.
And
then
I
should
know
what
to
do
,
when
I
got
older
:
I
should
*NL*
see
how
it
was
possible
to
lead
a
grand
life
here
--
now
--
in
England
.
I
*NL*
do
n't
feel
sure
about
doing
good
in
any
way
now
:
everything
seems
like
*NL*
going
on
a
mission
to
a
people
whose
language
I
do
n't
know
;
--
unless
it
*NL*
were
building
good
cottages
--
there
can
be
no
doubt
about
that
.
Oh
,
I
*NL*
hope
I
should
be
able
to
get
the
people
well
housed
in
Lowick
!
I
will
*NL*
draw
plenty
of
plans
while
I
have
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
checked
herself
suddenly
with
self-rebuke
for
the
presumptuous
*NL*
way
in
which
she
was
reckoning
on
uncertain
events
,
but
she
was
spared
*NL*
any
inward
effort
to
change
the
direction
of
her
thoughts
by
the
*NL*
appearance
of
a
cantering
horseman
round
a
turning
of
the
road
.
The
*NL*
well-groomed
chestnut
horse
and
two
beautiful
setters
could
leave
no
*NL*
doubt
that
the
rider
was
Sir
James
Chettam
.
He
discerned
Dorothea
,
*NL*
jumped
off
his
horse
at
once
,
and
,
having
delivered
it
to
his
groom
,
*NL*
advanced
towards
her
with
something
white
on
his
arm
,
at
which
the
two
*NL*
setters
were
barking
in
an
excited
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
delightful
to
meet
you
,
Miss
Brooke
,
''
he
said
,
raising
his
hat
and
*NL*
showing
his
sleekly
waving
blond
hair
.
``
It
has
hastened
the
pleasure
I
*NL*
was
looking
forward
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Brooke
was
annoyed
at
the
interruption
.
This
amiable
baronet
,
*NL*
really
a
suitable
husband
for
Celia
,
exaggerated
the
necessity
of
*NL*
making
himself
agreeable
to
the
elder
sister
.
Even
a
prospective
*NL*
brother-in-law
may
be
an
oppression
if
he
will
always
be
presupposing
*NL*
too
good
an
understanding
with
you
,
and
agreeing
with
you
even
when
you
*NL*
contradict
him
.
The
thought
that
he
had
made
the
mistake
of
paying
his
*NL*
addresses
to
herself
could
not
take
shape
:
all
her
mental
activity
was
*NL*
used
up
in
persuasions
of
another
kind
.
But
he
was
positively
*NL*
obtrusive
at
this
moment
,
and
his
dimpled
hands
were
quite
*NL*
disagreeable
.
Her
roused
temper
made
her
color
deeply
,
as
she
returned
*NL*
his
greeting
with
some
haughtiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
James
interpreted
the
heightened
color
in
the
way
most
gratifying
*NL*
to
himself
,
and
thought
he
never
saw
Miss
Brooke
looking
so
handsome
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
brought
a
little
petitioner
,
''
he
said
,
``
or
rather
,
I
have
*NL*
brought
him
to
see
if
he
will
be
approved
before
his
petition
is
*NL*
offered
.
''
He
showed
the
white
object
under
his
arm
,
which
was
a
tiny
*NL*
Maltese
puppy
,
one
of
nature
's
most
naive
toys
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
painful
to
me
to
see
these
creatures
that
are
bred
merely
as
*NL*
pets
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
whose
opinion
was
forming
itself
that
very
moment
*NL*
-LRB-
as
opinions
will
-RRB-
under
the
heat
of
irritation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
why
?
''
said
Sir
James
,
as
they
walked
forward
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
all
the
petting
that
is
given
them
does
not
make
them
happy
.
*NL*
They
are
too
helpless
:
their
lives
are
too
frail
.
A
weasel
or
a
mouse
*NL*
that
gets
its
own
living
is
more
interesting
.
I
like
to
think
that
the
*NL*
animals
about
us
have
souls
something
like
our
own
,
and
either
carry
on
*NL*
their
own
little
affairs
or
can
be
companions
to
us
,
like
Monk
here
.
*NL*
Those
creatures
are
parasitic
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
so
glad
I
know
that
you
do
not
like
them
,
''
said
good
Sir
James
.
*NL*
``
I
should
never
keep
them
for
myself
,
but
ladies
usually
are
fond
of
*NL*
these
Maltese
dogs
.
Here
,
John
,
take
this
dog
,
will
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
objectionable
puppy
,
whose
nose
and
eyes
were
equally
black
and
*NL*
expressive
,
was
thus
got
rid
of
,
since
Miss
Brooke
decided
that
it
had
*NL*
better
not
have
been
born
.
But
she
felt
it
necessary
to
explain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
not
judge
of
Celia
's
feeling
from
mine
.
I
think
she
likes
*NL*
these
small
pets
.
She
had
a
tiny
terrier
once
,
which
she
was
very
fond
*NL*
of
.
It
made
me
unhappy
,
because
I
was
afraid
of
treading
on
it
.
I
am
*NL*
rather
short-sighted
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
your
own
opinion
about
everything
,
Miss
Brooke
,
and
it
is
*NL*
always
a
good
opinion

*NL*
*NL*
What
answer
was
possible
to
such
stupid
complimenting
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
,
I
envy
you
that
,
''
Sir
James
said
,
as
they
continued
*NL*
walking
at
the
rather
brisk
pace
set
by
Dorothea
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
quite
understand
what
you
mean

about

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
there
are
few
who
would
see
it
more
readily
.
Do
you
know
,
*NL*
Lovegood
was
telling
me
yesterday
that
you
had
the
best
notion
in
the
*NL*
world
of
a
plan
for
cottages
--
quite
wonderful
for
a
young
lady
,
he
*NL*
thought
.
You
had
a
real
_
genus
_
,
to
use
his
expression
.
He
said
you
*NL*
wanted
Mr.
Brooke
to
build
a
new
set
of
cottages
,
but
he
seemed
to
*NL*
think
it
hardly
probable
that
your
uncle
would
consent
.
Do
you
know
,
*NL*
that
is
one
of
the
things
I
wish
to
do
--
I
mean
,
on
my
own
estate
.
I
*NL*
should
be
so
glad
to
carry
out
that
plan
of
yours
,
if
you
would
let
me
*NL*
see
it
.
Of
course
,
it
is
sinking
money
;
that
is
why
people
object
to
*NL*
it
.
Laborers
can
never
pay
rent
to
make
it
answer
.
But
,
after
all
,
it
*NL*
is
worth
doing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Worth
doing
!
yes
,
indeed
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
energetically
,
forgetting
*NL*
her
previous
small
vexations
.
``
I
think
we
deserve
to
be
beaten
out
of
*NL*
our
beautiful
houses
with
a
scourge
of
small
cords
--
all
of
us
who
let
*NL*
tenants
live
in
such
sties
as
we
see
round
us
.
Life
in
cottages
might
*NL*
be
happier
than
ours
,
if
they
were
real
houses
fit
for
human
beings
*NL*
from
whom
we
expect
duties
and

*NL*

*NL*
``
Yes

I
dare

very
faulty

But
I
have
been
*NL*
examining
all
the
plans
for
cottages
in
Loudon
's
book
,
and
picked
out
*NL*
what
seem
the
best
things
.
Oh
what
a
happiness
it
would
be
to
set
the
*NL*
pattern
about
here
!
I
think
instead
of
Lazarus
at
the
gate
,
we
should
*NL*
put
the
pigsty
cottages
outside
the
park-gate
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
was
in
the
best
temper
now
.
Sir
James
,
as
brother
in-law
,
*NL*
building
model
cottages
on
his
estate
,
and
then
,
perhaps
,
others
being
*NL*
built
at
Lowick
,
and
more
and
more
elsewhere
in
imitation
--
it
would
be
*NL*
as
if
the
spirit
of
Oberlin
had
passed
over
the
parishes
to
make
the
*NL*
life
of
poverty
beautiful
!
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
James
saw
all
the
plans
,
and
took
one
away
to
consult
upon
with
*NL*
Lovegood
.
He
also
took
away
a
complacent
sense
that
he
was
making
*NL*
great
progress
in
Miss
Brooke
's
good
opinion
.
The
Maltese
puppy
was
*NL*
not
offered
to
Celia
;
an
omission
which
Dorothea
afterwards
thought
of
*NL*
with
surprise
;
but
she
blamed
herself
for
it
.
She
had
been
engrossing
*NL*
Sir
James
.
After
all
,
it
was
a
relief
that
there
was
no
puppy
to
tread
*NL*
upon
.
*NL*
*NL*
Celia
was
present
while
the
plans
were
being
examined
,
and
observed
Sir
*NL*
James
's
illusion
.
``
He
thinks
that
Dodo
cares
about
him
,
and
she
only
*NL*
cares
about
her
plans
.
Yet
I
am
not
certain
that
she
would
refuse
him
*NL*
if
she
thought
he
would
let
her
manage
everything
and
carry
out
all
her
*NL*
notions
.
And
how
very
uncomfortable
Sir
James
would
be
!
I
can
not
bear
*NL*
notions
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
Celia
's
private
luxury
to
indulge
in
this
dislike
.
She
dared
*NL*
not
confess
it
to
her
sister
in
any
direct
statement
,
for
that
would
be
*NL*
laying
herself
open
to
a
demonstration
that
she
was
somehow
or
other
at
*NL*
war
with
all
goodness
.
But
on
safe
opportunities
,
she
had
an
indirect
*NL*
mode
of
making
her
negative
wisdom
tell
upon
Dorothea
,
and
calling
her
*NL*
down
from
her
rhapsodic
mood
by
reminding
her
that
people
were
staring
,
*NL*
not
listening
.
Celia
was
not
impulsive
:
what
she
had
to
say
could
*NL*
wait
,
and
came
from
her
always
with
the
same
quiet
staccato
evenness
.
*NL*
When
people
talked
with
energy
and
emphasis
she
watched
their
faces
and
*NL*
features
merely
.
She
never
could
understand
how
well-bred
persons
*NL*
consented
to
sing
and
open
their
mouths
in
the
ridiculous
manner
*NL*
requisite
for
that
vocal
exercise
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
many
days
before
Mr.
Casaubon
paid
a
morning
visit
,
on
which
*NL*
he
was
invited
again
for
the
following
week
to
dine
and
stay
the
night
.
*NL*
Thus
Dorothea
had
three
more
conversations
with
him
,
and
was
convinced
*NL*
that
her
first
impressions
had
been
just
.
He
was
all
she
had
at
first
*NL*
imagined
him
to
be
:
almost
everything
he
had
said
seemed
like
a
*NL*
specimen
from
a
mine
,
or
the
inscription
on
the
door
of
a
museum
which
*NL*
might
open
on
the
treasures
of
past
ages
;
and
this
trust
in
his
mental
*NL*
wealth
was
all
the
deeper
and
more
effective
on
her
inclination
because
*NL*
it
was
now
obvious
that
his
visits
were
made
for
her
sake
.
This
*NL*
accomplished
man
condescended
to
think
of
a
young
girl
,
and
take
the
*NL*
pains
to
talk
to
her
,
not
with
absurd
compliment
,
but
with
an
appeal
to
*NL*
her
understanding
,
and
sometimes
with
instructive
correction
.
What
*NL*
delightful
companionship
!
Mr.
Casaubon
seemed
even
unconscious
that
*NL*
trivialities
existed
,
and
never
handed
round
that
small-talk
of
heavy
*NL*
men
which
is
as
acceptable
as
stale
bride-cake
brought
forth
with
an
*NL*
odor
of
cupboard
.
He
talked
of
what
he
was
interested
in
,
or
else
he
*NL*
was
silent
and
bowed
with
sad
civility
.
To
Dorothea
this
was
adorable
*NL*
genuineness
,
and
religious
abstinence
from
that
artificiality
which
*NL*
uses
up
the
soul
in
the
efforts
of
pretence
.
For
she
looked
as
*NL*
reverently
at
Mr.
Casaubon
's
religious
elevation
above
herself
as
she
*NL*
did
at
his
intellect
and
learning
.
He
assented
to
her
expressions
of
*NL*
devout
feeling
,
and
usually
with
an
appropriate
quotation
;
he
allowed
*NL*
himself
to
say
that
he
had
gone
through
some
spiritual
conflicts
in
his
*NL*
youth
;
in
short
,
Dorothea
saw
that
here
she
might
reckon
on
*NL*
understanding
,
sympathy
,
and
guidance
.
On
one
--
only
one
--
of
her
*NL*
favorite
themes
she
was
disappointed
.
Mr.
Casaubon
apparently
did
not
*NL*
care
about
building
cottages
,
and
diverted
the
talk
to
the
extremely
*NL*
narrow
accommodation
which
was
to
be
had
in
the
dwellings
of
the
*NL*
ancient
Egyptians
,
as
if
to
check
a
too
high
standard
.
After
he
was
*NL*
gone
,
Dorothea
dwelt
with
some
agitation
on
this
indifference
of
his
;
*NL*
and
her
mind
was
much
exercised
with
arguments
drawn
from
the
varying
*NL*
conditions
of
climate
which
modify
human
needs
,
and
from
the
admitted
*NL*
wickedness
of
pagan
despots
.
Should
she
not
urge
these
arguments
on
*NL*
Mr.
Casaubon
when
he
came
again
?
But
further
reflection
told
her
that
*NL*
she
was
presumptuous
in
demanding
his
attention
to
such
a
subject
;
he
*NL*
would
not
disapprove
of
her
occupying
herself
with
it
in
leisure
*NL*
moments
,
as
other
women
expected
to
occupy
themselves
with
their
dress
*NL*
and
embroidery
--
would
not
forbid
it
when
--
Dorothea
felt
rather
ashamed
*NL*
as
she
detected
herself
in
these
speculations
.
But
her
uncle
had
been
*NL*
invited
to
go
to
Lowick
to
stay
a
couple
of
days
:
was
it
reasonable
to
*NL*
suppose
that
Mr.
Casaubon
delighted
in
Mr.
Brooke
's
society
for
its
own
*NL*
sake
,
either
with
or
without
documents
?
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
that
little
disappointment
made
her
delight
the
more
in
Sir
*NL*
James
Chettam
's
readiness
to
set
on
foot
the
desired
improvements
.
He
*NL*
came
much
oftener
than
Mr.
Casaubon
,
and
Dorothea
ceased
to
find
him
*NL*
disagreeable
since
he
showed
himself
so
entirely
in
earnest
;
for
he
had
*NL*
already
entered
with
much
practical
ability
into
Lovegood
's
estimates
,
*NL*
and
was
charmingly
docile
.
She
proposed
to
build
a
couple
of
cottages
,
*NL*
and
transfer
two
families
from
their
old
cabins
,
which
could
then
be
*NL*
pulled
down
,
so
that
new
ones
could
be
built
on
the
old
sites
.
Sir
*NL*
James
said
``
Exactly
,
''
and
she
bore
the
word
remarkably
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
Certainly
these
men
who
had
so
few
spontaneous
ideas
might
be
very
*NL*
useful
members
of
society
under
good
feminine
direction
,
if
they
were
*NL*
fortunate
in
choosing
their
sisters-in-law
!
It
is
difficult
to
say
*NL*
whether
there
was
or
was
not
a
little
wilfulness
in
her
continuing
*NL*
blind
to
the
possibility
that
another
sort
of
choice
was
in
question
in
*NL*
relation
to
her
.
But
her
life
was
just
now
full
of
hope
and
action
:
*NL*
she
was
not
only
thinking
of
her
plans
,
but
getting
down
learned
books
*NL*
from
the
library
and
reading
many
things
hastily
-LRB-
that
she
might
be
a
*NL*
little
less
ignorant
in
talking
to
Mr.
Casaubon
-RRB-
,
all
the
while
being
*NL*
visited
with
conscientious
questionings
whether
she
were
not
exalting
*NL*
these
poor
doings
above
measure
and
contemplating
them
with
that
*NL*
self-satisfaction
which
was
the
last
doom
of
ignorance
and
folly
.

inconsiderately

``

``

said

recollecting
herself
,
and
laying

hand
on

her
sister
's
a
moment
,
``

``

,
in

usual
purring
way
.
``
They

Dorothea
laughed

``

creature

She
pinched
*NL*
Celia
's
chin
,
being
in
the
mood
now
to
think
her
very
winning
and
*NL*
lovely
--
fit
hereafter
to
be
an
eternal
cherub
,
and
if
it
were
not
*NL*
doctrinally
wrong
to
say
so
,
hardly
more
in
need
of
salvation
than
a
*NL*
squirrel
.
``
Of

*NL*
``

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly

Dorothea
*NL*
had
never
hinted
this
before
,
waiting
,
from
a
certain
shyness
on
such
*NL*
subjects
which
was
mutual
between
the
sisters
,
until
it
should
be
*NL*
introduced
by
some
decisive
event

Celia
blushed
,
but
said
at
once
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pray
do
not
make
that
mistake
any
longer

When
Tantripp
was

brushing
my
hair

she
said
that

knew
from

``
How

Dorothea
,
indignantly
,
not
the
less
angry
because
details
asleep
in
her

memory
were
now
awakened
to
confirm
the
unwelcome
revelation
.
``
You

must
have
asked

questions

is
degrading

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
no

The
revulsion
was
so
strong
and
painful
in
Dorothea
's
mind
that
the
*NL*
tears
welled
up
and
flowed
abundantly
.
All
her
dear
plans
were
*NL*
embittered
,
and
she
thought
with
disgust
of
Sir
James
's
conceiving
that
*NL*
she
recognized
him
as
her
lover

There
was
vexation
too
on
account
of
*NL*
Celia
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
could
he
expect
it

she
burst
forth
in
her
most
impetuous
manner

*NL*
``
I
have
never
agreed

``
Fond

How
can
you
choose
such
odious
expressions

said
*NL*
Dorothea
,
passionately
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
me
,
Dorothea
,
I
suppose
it
would
be
right
for
you
to
be
fond
of
a
*NL*
man
whom
you
accepted
for
a
husband
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
offensive
to
me
to
say
that
Sir
James
could
think
I
was
fond
of
*NL*
him
.
Besides
,
it
is
not
the
right
word
for
the
feeling
I
must
have
*NL*
towards
the
man
I
would
accept
as
a
husband
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
am
sorry
for
Sir
James
.
I
thought
it
right
to
tell
you
,
*NL*
because
you
went
on
as
you
always
do
,
never
looking
just
where
you
are
,
*NL*
and
treading
in
the
wrong
place
.
You
always
see
what
nobody
else
sees
;
*NL*
it
is
impossible
to
satisfy
you
;
yet
you
never
see
what
is
quite
plain
.
*NL*
That
's
your
way
,
Dodo
.
''
Something
certainly
gave
Celia
unusual
courage
;
*NL*
and
she
was
not
sparing
the
sister
of
whom
she
was
occasionally
in
awe
.
*NL*
Who
can
tell
what
just
criticisms
Murr
the
Cat
may
be
passing
on
us
*NL*
beings
of
wider
speculation
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
very
painful
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
feeling
scourged
.
``
I
can
have
no
*NL*
more
to
do
with
the
cottages
.
I
must
be
uncivil
to
him

I
must
tell
*NL*
him
I
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
them

It
is
very
painful

''
Her
eyes
*NL*
filled
again
with
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait
a
little

Think
about
it

You

going
away

two
to
see
his
sister

There
will
be
nobody
besides
Lovegood

''
*NL*
Celia
could
not
help
relenting
.
``
Poor
Dodo
,
''
she
went
on
,
in
an
*NL*
amiable
staccato
.
``
It
is
very
hard

Do
you

care
about
my

fellow-creatures

houses
in
that
childish
way
?
I
may
well
make

mistakes

How
can
one
ever
do
anything
nobly
Christian
,
living
among
*NL*
people
with
such
petty
thoughts
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
No
more
was
said
;
Dorothea
was
too
much
jarred
to
recover
her
temper
*NL*
and
behave
so
as
to
show
that
she
admitted
any
error
in
herself
.
She
*NL*
was
disposed
rather
to
accuse
the
intolerable
narrowness
and
the
*NL*
purblind
conscience
of
the
society
around
her
:
and
Celia
was
no
longer
*NL*
the
eternal
cherub
,
but
a
thorn
in
her
spirit
,
a
pink-and-white
*NL*
nullifidian
,
worse
than
any
discouraging
presence
in
the
``
Pilgrim
's
*NL*
Progress
.
''
The
_
fad
_
of
drawing
plans
!
What
was
life
worth
--
what
great
*NL*
faith
was
possible
when
the
whole
effect
of
one
's
actions
could
be
*NL*
withered
up
into
such
parched
rubbish
as
that
?
When
she
got
out
of
the
*NL*
carriage
,
her
cheeks
were
pale
and
her
eyelids
red
.
She
was
an
image
*NL*
of
sorrow
,
and
her
uncle
who
met
her
in
the
hall
would
have
been
*NL*
alarmed
,
if
Celia
had
not
been
close
to
her
looking
so
pretty
and
*NL*
composed
,
that
he
at
once
concluded
Dorothea
's
tears
to
have
their
*NL*
origin
in
her
excessive
religiousness
.
He
had
returned
,
during
their
*NL*
absence
,
from
a
journey
to
the
county
town
,
about
a
petition
for
the
*NL*
pardon
of
some
criminal
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
my
dears
,
''
he
said
,
kindly
,
as
they
went
up
to
kiss
him
,
``
I
hope
*NL*
nothing
disagreeable
has
happened
while
I
have
been
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
uncle
,
''
said
Celia
,
``
we
have
been
to
Freshitt
to
look
at
the
*NL*
cottages
.
We
thought
you
would
have
been
at
home
to
lunch
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
came
by
Lowick
to
lunch
--
you
did
n't
know
I
came
by
Lowick
.
And
I
*NL*
have
brought
a
couple
of
pamphlets
for
you
,
Dorothea
--
in
the
library
,
*NL*
you
know
;
they
lie
on
the
table
in
the
library
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
seemed
as
if
an
electric
stream
went
through
Dorothea
,
thrilling
her
*NL*
from
despair
into
expectation
.
They
were
pamphlets
about
the
early
*NL*
Church
.
The
oppression
of
Celia
,
Tantripp
,
and
Sir
James
was
shaken
*NL*
off
,
and
she
walked
straight
to
the
library
.
Celia
went
up-stairs
.
Mr.
*NL*
Brooke
was
detained
by
a
message
,
but
when
he
re-entered
the
library
,
*NL*
he
found
Dorothea
seated
and
already
deep
in
one
of
the
pamphlets
which
*NL*
had
some
marginal
manuscript
of
Mr.
Casaubon
's
,
--
taking
it
in
as
*NL*
eagerly
as
she
might
have
taken
in
the
scent
of
a
fresh
bouquet
after
a
*NL*
dry
,
hot
,
dreary
walk
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
getting
away
from
Tipton
and
Freshitt
,
and
her
own
sad
*NL*
liability
to
tread
in
the
wrong
places
on
her
way
to
the
New
Jerusalem
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Brooke
sat
down
in
his
arm-chair
,
stretched
his
legs
towards
the
*NL*
wood-fire
,
which
had
fallen
into
a
wondrous
mass
of
glowing
dice
*NL*
between
the
dogs
,
and
rubbed
his
hands
gently
,
looking
very
mildly
*NL*
towards
Dorothea
,
but
with
a
neutral
leisurely
air
,
as
if
he
had
*NL*
nothing
particular
to
say
.
Dorothea
closed
her
pamphlet
,
as
soon
as
*NL*
she
was
aware
of
her
uncle
's
presence
,
and
rose
as
if
to
go
.
Usually
*NL*
she
would
have
been
interested
about
her
uncle
's
merciful
errand
on
*NL*
behalf
of
the
criminal
,
but
her
late
agitation
had
made
her
*NL*
absent-minded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
came
back
by
Lowick
,
you
know
,
''
said
Mr.
Brooke
,
not
as
if
with
any
*NL*
intention
to
arrest
her
departure
,
but
apparently
from
his
usual
*NL*
tendency
to
say
what
he
had
said
before
.
This
fundamental
principle
of
*NL*
human
speech
was
markedly
exhibited
in
Mr.
Brooke
.
``
I
lunched
there
*NL*
and
saw
Casaubon
's
library
,
and
that
kind
of
thing
.
There
's
a
sharp
*NL*
air
,
driving
.
Wo
n't
you
sit
down
,
my
dear
?
You
look
cold
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
felt
quite
inclined
to
accept
the
invitation
.
Some
times
,
*NL*
when
her
uncle
's
easy
way
of
taking
things
did
not
happen
to
be
*NL*
exasperating
,
it
was
rather
soothing
.
She
threw
off
her
mantle
and
*NL*
bonnet
,
and
sat
down
opposite
to
him
,
enjoying
the
glow
,
but
lifting
up
*NL*
her
beautiful
hands
for
a
screen
.
They
were
not
thin
hands
,
or
small
*NL*
hands
;
but
powerful
,
feminine
,
maternal
hands
.
She
seemed
to
be
*NL*
holding
them
up
in
propitiation
for
her
passionate
desire
to
know
and
*NL*
to
think
,
which
in
the
unfriendly
mediums
of
Tipton
and
Freshitt
had
*NL*
issued
in
crying
and
red
eyelids
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
bethought
herself
now
of
the
condemned
criminal
.
``
What
news
have
*NL*
you
brought
about
the
sheep-stealer
,
uncle
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
poor
Bunch
?
--
well
,
it
seems
we
ca
n't
get
him
off
--
he
is
to
be
*NL*
hanged
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
's
brow
took
an
expression
of
reprobation
and
pity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hanged
,
you
know
,
''
said
Mr.
Brooke
,
with
a
quiet
nod
.
``
Poor
Romilly
!
*NL*
he
would
have
helped
us
.
I
knew
Romilly

Casaubon
did
n't
know

Romilly
.
He
is
a
little
buried
in
books
,
you
know
,
Casaubon
is

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
a
man
has
great
studies
and
is
writing
a
great
work
,
he
must
of
*NL*
course
give
up
seeing
much
of
the
world
.
How
can
he
go
about
making
*NL*
acquaintances
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
true

But

I
have
always
been
a

bachelor
too
,
but
I
have
that
sort
of
disposition
that
I
never
moped

*NL*
it
was
my
way
to
go
about
everywhere

take
in
everything

I
never

moped

It
would

Dorothea

energetically

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
Mr.
Brooke
,
without
showing
any
surprise
,
or
*NL*
other
emotion
.
``
Well

ten
years

I
never
got
anything
out

any
ideas

However

he
is
a
tiptop
man
and
may
be
a
bishop
--
that
kind

*NL*
thing
,

Dorothea
could
not
speak

*NL*

long
and

short
of

*NL*
No
one
could
have
detected
any
anxiety

manner

he
*NL*
did
really

something

did
not

he

repeated

Mr.

feeling
some
of
her
late
irritation
revive

*NL*
*NL*
Mr.

wondered

felt
that
women
were
an
inexhaustible
subject

of
study
,
since
even
he
at
his
age
was
not
in
a
perfect
state

prediction
about

no

at
all

Mr.

Brooke
,
whose
conscience
was
really
roused
to
do
the
best
he
could
for
*NL*
his
niece
on
this
occasion
.
``
Life
is
n't
cast
in
a
mould
--
not
cut
out
*NL*
by
rule
and
line
,
and
that
sort
of
thing
.
I
never
married
myself
,
and
*NL*
it
will
be
the
better
for
you
and
yours
.
The
fact
is
,
I
never
loved
*NL*
any
one
well
enough
to
put
myself
into
a
noose
for
them
.
It
_
is
_
a
*NL*
noose
,
you
know
.
Temper
,
now
.
There
is
temper
.
And
a
husband
likes
*NL*
to
be
master
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
that
I
must
expect
trials
,
uncle
.
Marriage
is
a
state
of
*NL*
higher
duties
.
I
never
thought
of
it
as
mere
personal
ease
,
''
said
poor
*NL*
Dorothea
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
are
not
fond
of
show
,
a
great
establishment
,
balls
,
dinners
,
*NL*
that
kind
of
thing
.
I
can
see
that
Casaubon
's
ways
might
suit
you
*NL*
better
than
Chettam
's
.
And
you
shall
do
as
you
like
,
my
dear
.
I
would
*NL*
not
hinder
Casaubon
;
I
said
so
at
once
;
for
there
is
no
knowing
how
*NL*
anything
may
turn
out
.
You
have
not
the
same
tastes
as
every
young
*NL*
lady
;
and
a
clergyman
and
scholar
--
who
may
be
a
bishop
--
that
kind
of
*NL*
thing
--
may
suit
you
better
than
Chettam
.
Chettam
is
a
good
fellow
,
a
*NL*
good
sound-hearted
fellow
,
you
know
;
but
he
does
n't
go
much
into
ideas
.
*NL*
I
did
,
when
I
was
his
age
.
But
Casaubon
's
eyes
,
now
.
I
think
he
has
*NL*
hurt
them
a
little
with
too
much
reading
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
be
all
the
happier
,
uncle
,
the
more
room
there
was
for
me
to
*NL*
help
him
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
ardently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
quite
made
up
your
mind
,
I
see
.
Well
,
my
dear
,
the
fact
is
,
*NL*
I
have
a
letter
for
you
in
my
pocket
.
''
Mr.
Brooke
handed
the
letter
to
*NL*
Dorothea
,
but
as
she
rose
to
go
away
,
he
added
,
``
There
is
not
too
much
*NL*
hurry
,
my
dear
.
Think
about
it
,
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
Dorothea
had
left
him
,
he
reflected
that
he
had
certainly
spoken
*NL*
strongly
:
he
had
put
the
risks
of
marriage
before
her
in
a
striking
*NL*
manner
.
It
was
his
duty
to
do
so
.
But
as
to
pretending
to
be
wise
for
*NL*
young
people
,
--
no
uncle
,
however
much
he
had
travelled
in
his
youth
,
*NL*
absorbed
the
new
ideas
,
and
dined
with
celebrities
now
deceased
,
could
*NL*
pretend
to
judge
what
sort
of
marriage
would
turn
out
well
for
a
young
*NL*
girl
who
preferred
Casaubon
to
Chettam
.
In
short
,
woman
was
a
problem
*NL*
which
,
since
Mr.
Brooke
's
mind
felt
blank
before
it
,
could
be
hardly
*NL*
less
complicated
than
the
revolutions
of
an
irregular
solid

MY
DEAR
MISS
BROOKE
,
--
I
have
your
guardian
's
permission
to
address
you
*NL*
on
a
subject
than
which
I
have
none
more
at
heart
.
I
am
not
,
I
trust
,
*NL*
mistaken
in
the
recognition
of
some
deeper
correspondence
than
that
of
*NL*
date
in
the
fact
that
a
consciousness
of
need
in
my
own
life
had
arisen
*NL*
contemporaneously
with
the
possibility
of
my
becoming
acquainted
with
*NL*
you
.
For
in
the
first
hour
of
meeting
you
,
I
had
an
impression
of
your
*NL*
eminent
and
perhaps
exclusive
fitness
to
supply
that
need
-LRB-
connected
,
I
*NL*
may
say
,
with
such
activity
of
the
affections
as
even
the
*NL*
preoccupations
of
a
work
too
special
to
be
abdicated
could
not
*NL*
uninterruptedly
dissimulate
-RRB-
;
and
each
succeeding
opportunity
for
*NL*
observation
has
given
the
impression
an
added
depth
by
convincing
me
*NL*
more
emphatically
of
that
fitness
which
I
had
preconceived
,
and
thus
*NL*
evoking
more
decisively
those
affections
to
which
I
have
but
now
*NL*
referred
.
Our
conversations
have
,
I
think
,
made
sufficiently
clear
to
*NL*
you
the
tenor
of
my
life
and
purposes
:
a
tenor
unsuited
,
I
am
aware
,
to
*NL*
the
commoner
order
of
minds
.
But
I
have
discerned
in
you
an
elevation
*NL*
of
thought
and
a
capability
of
devotedness
,
which
I
had
hitherto
not
*NL*
conceived
to
be
compatible
either
with
the
early
bloom
of
youth
or
with
*NL*
those
graces
of
sex
that
may
be
said
at
once
to
win
and
to
confer
*NL*
distinction
when
combined
,
as
they
notably
are
in
you
,
with
the
mental
*NL*
qualities
above
indicated
.
It
was
,
I
confess
,
beyond
my
hope
to
meet
*NL*
with
this
rare
combination
of
elements
both
solid
and
attractive
,
*NL*
adapted
to
supply
aid
in
graver
labors
and
to
cast
a
charm
over
vacant
*NL*
hours
;
and
but
for
the
event
of
my
introduction
to
you
-LRB-
which
,
let
me
*NL*
again
say
,
I
trust
not
to
be
superficially
coincident
with
*NL*
foreshadowing
needs
,
but
providentially
related
thereto
as
stages
*NL*
towards
the
completion
of
a
life
's
plan
-RRB-
,
I
should
presumably
have
gone
*NL*
on
to
the
last
without
any
attempt
to
lighten
my
solitariness
by
a
*NL*
matrimonial
union
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
,
my
dear
Miss
Brooke
,
is
the
accurate
statement
of
my
feelings
;
*NL*
and
I
rely
on
your
kind
indulgence
in
venturing
now
to
ask
you
how
far
*NL*
your
own
are
of
a
nature
to
confirm
my
happy
presentiment
.
To
be
*NL*
accepted
by
you
as
your
husband
and
the
earthly
guardian
of
your
*NL*
welfare
,
I
should
regard
as
the
highest
of
providential
gifts
.
In
*NL*
return
I
can
at
least
offer
you
an
affection
hitherto
unwasted
,
and
the
*NL*
faithful
consecration
of
a
life
which
,
however
short
in
the
sequel
,
has
*NL*
no
backward
pages
whereon
,
if
you
choose
to
turn
them
,
you
will
find
*NL*
records
such
as
might
justly
cause
you
either
bitterness
or
shame
.
I
*NL*
await
the
expression
of
your
sentiments
with
an
anxiety
which
it
would
*NL*
be
the
part
of
wisdom
-LRB-
were
it
possible
-RRB-
to
divert
by
a
more
arduous
*NL*
labor
than
usual
.
But
in
this
order
of
experience
I
am
still
young
,
*NL*
and
in
looking
forward
to
an
unfavorable
possibility
I
can
not
but
feel
*NL*
that
resignation
to
solitude
will
be
more
difficult
after
the
temporary
*NL*
illumination
of
hope
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
any
case
,
I
shall
remain
,
*NL*
Yours
with
sincere
devotion
,
*NL*
EDWARD
CASAUBON
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
trembled
while
she
read
this
letter
;
then
she
fell
on
her
*NL*
knees
,
buried
her
face
,
and
sobbed
.
She
could
not
pray
:
under
the
rush
*NL*
of
solemn
emotion
in
which
thoughts
became
vague
and
images
floated
*NL*
uncertainly
,
she
could
but
cast
herself
,
with
a
childlike
sense
of
*NL*
reclining
,
in
the
lap
of
a
divine
consciousness
which
sustained
her
*NL*
own
.
She
remained
in
that
attitude
till
it
was
time
to
dress
for
*NL*
dinner
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
could
it
occur
to
her
to
examine
the
letter
,
to
look
at
it
*NL*
critically
as
a
profession
of
love
?
Her
whole
soul
was
possessed
by
*NL*
the
fact
that
a
fuller
life
was
opening
before
her
:
she
was
a
neophyte
*NL*
about
to
enter
on
a
higher
grade
of
initiation
.
She
was
going
to
have
*NL*
room
for
the
energies
which
stirred
uneasily
under
the
dimness
and
*NL*
pressure
of
her
own
ignorance
and
the
petty
peremptoriness
of
the
*NL*
world
's
habits
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
she
would
be
able
to
devote
herself
to
large
yet
definite
duties
;
*NL*
now
she
would
be
allowed
to
live
continually
in
the
light
of
a
mind
*NL*
that
she
could
reverence
.
This
hope
was
not
unmixed
with
the
glow
of
*NL*
proud
delight
--
the
joyous
maiden
surprise
that
she
was
chosen
by
the
*NL*
man
whom
her
admiration
had
chosen
.
All
Dorothea
's
passion
was
*NL*
transfused
through
a
mind
struggling
towards
an
ideal
life
;
the
*NL*
radiance
of
her
transfigured
girlhood
fell
on
the
first
object
that
*NL*
came
within
its
level
.
The
impetus
with
which
inclination
became
*NL*
resolution
was
heightened
by
those
little
events
of
the
day
which
had
*NL*
roused
her
discontent
with
the
actual
conditions
of
her
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
dinner
,
when
Celia
was
playing
an
``
air
,
with
variations
,
''
a
small
*NL*
kind
of
tinkling
which
symbolized
the
aesthetic
part
of
the
young
*NL*
ladies
'
education
,
Dorothea
went
up
to
her
room
to
answer
Mr.
*NL*
Casaubon
's
letter
.
Why
should
she
defer
the
answer
?
She
wrote
it
over
*NL*
three
times
,
not
because
she
wished
to
change
the
wording
,
but
because
*NL*
her
hand
was
unusually
uncertain
,
and
she
could
not
bear
that
Mr.
*NL*
Casaubon
should
think
her
handwriting
bad
and
illegible
.
She
piqued
*NL*
herself
on
writing
a
hand
in
which
each
letter
was
distinguishable
*NL*
without
any
large
range
of
conjecture
,
and
she
meant
to
make
much
use
*NL*
of
this
accomplishment
,
to
save
Mr.
Casaubon
's
eyes
.
Three
times
she
*NL*
wrote
.
*NL*
*NL*
MY
DEAR
MR.
CASAUBON
,
--
I
am
very
grateful
to
you
for
loving
me
,
and
*NL*
thinking
me
worthy
to
be
your
wife
.
I
can
look
forward
to
no
better
*NL*
happiness
than
that
which
would
be
one
with
yours
.
If
I
said
more
,
it
*NL*
would
only
be
the
same
thing
written
out
at
greater
length
,
for
I
*NL*
can
not
now
dwell
on
any
other
thought
than
that
I
may
be
through
life

*NL*
Yours
devotedly

DOROTHEA

Later
in
the
evening
she
followed
her
uncle
into
the
library
to
give
*NL*
him
the
letter
,
that
he
might
send
it
in
the
morning
.
He
was
*NL*
surprised
,
but
his
surprise
only
issued
in
a
few
moments
'
silence
,
*NL*
during
which
he
pushed
about
various
objects
on
his
writing-table
,
and
*NL*
finally
stood
with
his
back
to
the
fire
,
his
glasses
on
his
nose
,
*NL*
looking
at
the
address
of
Dorothea
's
letter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
thought
enough
about
this
,
my
dear
?
''
he
said
at
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
was
no
need
to
think
long
,
uncle
.
I
know
of
nothing
to
make
me
*NL*
vacillate
.
If
I
changed
my
mind
,
it
must
be
because
of
something
*NL*
important
and
entirely
new
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
--
then
you
have
accepted
him
?
Then
Chettam
has
no
chance
?
Has
*NL*
Chettam
offended
you
--
offended
you
,
you
know
?
What
is
it
you
do
n't
*NL*
like
in
Chettam
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
nothing
that
I
like
in
him
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
rather
*NL*
impetuously
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Brooke
threw
his
head
and
shoulders
backward
as
if
some
one
had
*NL*
thrown
a
light
missile
at
him
.
Dorothea
immediately
felt
some
*NL*
self-rebuke
,
and
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
mean
in
the
light
of
a
husband
.
He
is
very
kind
,
I
think
--
really
*NL*
very
good
about
the
cottages
.
A
well-meaning
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
must
have
a
scholar
,
and
that
sort
of
thing
?
Well
,
it
lies
a
*NL*
little
in
our
family
.
I
had
it
myself
--
that
love
of
knowledge
,
and
*NL*
going
into
everything
--
a
little
too
much
--
it
took
me
too
far
;
though
*NL*
that
sort
of
thing
does
n't
often
run
in
the
female-line
;
or
it
runs
*NL*
underground
like
the
rivers
in
Greece
,
you
know
--
it
comes
out
in
the
*NL*
sons
.
Clever
sons
,
clever
mothers
.
I
went
a
good
deal
into
that
,
at
*NL*
one
time
.
However
,
my
dear
,
I
have
always
said
that
people
should
do
*NL*
as
they
like
in
these
things
,
up
to
a
certain
point
.
I
could
n't
,
as
*NL*
your
guardian
,
have
consented
to
a
bad
match
.
But
Casaubon
stands
*NL*
well
:
his
position
is
good
.
I
am
afraid
Chettam
will
be
hurt
,
though
,
*NL*
and
Mrs.
Cadwallader
will
blame
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
evening
,
of
course
,
Celia
knew
nothing
of
what
had
happened
.
She
*NL*
attributed
Dorothea
's
abstracted
manner
,
and
the
evidence
of
further
*NL*
crying
since
they
had
got
home
,
to
the
temper
she
had
been
in
about
Sir
*NL*
James
Chettam
and
the
buildings
,
and
was
careful
not
to
give
further
*NL*
offence
:
having
once
said
what
she
wanted
to
say
,
Celia
had
no
*NL*
disposition
to
recur
to
disagreeable
subjects
.
It
had
been
her
nature
*NL*
when
a
child
never
to
quarrel
with
any
one
--
only
to
observe
with
wonder
*NL*
that
they
quarrelled
with
her
,
and
looked
like
turkey-cocks
;
whereupon
*NL*
she
was
ready
to
play
at
cat
's
cradle
with
them
whenever
they
recovered
*NL*
themselves
.
And
as
to
Dorothea
,
it
had
always
been
her
way
to
find
*NL*
something
wrong
in
her
sister
's
words
,
though
Celia
inwardly
protested
*NL*
that
she
always
said
just
how
things
were
,
and
nothing
else
:
she
never
*NL*
did
and
never
could
put
words
together
out
of
her
own
head
.
But
the
*NL*
best
of
Dodo
was
,
that
she
did
not
keep
angry
for
long
together
.
Now
,
*NL*
though
they
had
hardly
spoken
to
each
other
all
the
evening
,
yet
when
*NL*
Celia
put
by
her
work
,
intending
to
go
to
bed
,
a
proceeding
in
which
*NL*
she
was
always
much
the
earlier
,
Dorothea
,
who
was
seated
on
a
low
*NL*
stool
,
unable
to
occupy
herself
except
in
meditation
,
said
,
with
the
*NL*
musical
intonation
which
in
moments
of
deep
but
quiet
feeling
made
her
*NL*
speech
like
a
fine
bit
of
recitative
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Celia
,
dear
,
come
and
kiss
me
,
''
holding
her
arms
open
as
she
spoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
Celia
knelt
down
to
get
the
right
level
and
gave
her
little
butterfly
*NL*
kiss
,
while
Dorothea
encircled
her
with
gentle
arms
and
pressed
her
*NL*
lips
gravely
on
each
cheek
in
turn
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
sit
up
,
Dodo
,
you
are
so
pale
to-night
:
go
to
bed
soon
,
''
said
*NL*
Celia
,
in
a
comfortable
way
,
without
any
touch
of
pathos
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
dear
,
I
am
very
,
very
happy
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
fervently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
much
the
better
,
''
thought
Celia
.
``
But
how
strangely
Dodo
goes
from
*NL*
one
extreme
to
the
other
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
,
at
luncheon
,
the
butler
,
handing
something
to
Mr.
Brooke
,
*NL*
said
,
``
Jonas
is
come
back
,
sir
,
and
has
brought
this
letter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Brooke
read
the
letter
,
and
then
,
nodding
toward
Dorothea
,
said
,
*NL*
``
Casaubon
,
my
dear
:
he
will
be
here
to
dinner
;
he
did
n't
wait
to
write
*NL*
more
--
did
n't
wait
,
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
could
not
seem
remarkable
to
Celia
that
a
dinner
guest
should
be
*NL*
announced
to
her
sister
beforehand
,
but
,
her
eyes
following
the
same
*NL*
direction
as
her
uncle
's
,
she
was
struck
with
the
peculiar
effect
of
*NL*
the
announcement
on
Dorothea
.
It
seemed
as
if
something
like
the
*NL*
reflection
of
a
white
sunlit
wing
had
passed
across
her
features
,
*NL*
ending
in
one
of
her
rare
blushes
.
For
the
first
time
it
entered
into
*NL*
Celia
's
mind
that
there
might
be
something
more
between
Mr.
Casaubon
*NL*
and
her
sister
than
his
delight
in
bookish
talk
and
her
delight
in
*NL*
listening
.
Hitherto
she
had
classed
the
admiration
for
this
``
ugly
''
and
*NL*
learned
acquaintance
with
the
admiration
for
Monsieur
Liret
at
*NL*
Lausanne
,
also
ugly
and
learned
.
Dorothea
had
never
been
tired
of
*NL*
listening
to
old
Monsieur
Liret
when
Celia
's
feet
were
as
cold
as
*NL*
possible
,
and
when
it
had
really
become
dreadful
to
see
the
skin
of
his
*NL*
bald
head
moving
about
.
Why
then
should
her
enthusiasm
not
extend
to
*NL*
Mr.
Casaubon
simply
in
the
same
way
as
to
Monsieur
Liret
?
And
it
*NL*
seemed
probable
that
all
learned
men
had
a
sort
of
schoolmaster
's
view
*NL*
of
young
people
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
now
Celia
was
really
startled
at
the
suspicion
which
had
darted
*NL*
into
her
mind
.
She
was
seldom
taken
by
surprise
in
this
way
,
her
*NL*
marvellous
quickness
in
observing
a
certain
order
of
signs
generally
*NL*
preparing
her
to
expect
such
outward
events
as
she
had
an
interest
in
.
*NL*
Not
that
she
now
imagined
Mr.
Casaubon
to
be
already
an
accepted
lover
:
*NL*
she
had
only
begun
to
feel
disgust
at
the
possibility
that
anything
in
*NL*
Dorothea
's
mind
could
tend
towards
such
an
issue
.
Here
was
something
*NL*
really
to
vex
her
about
Dodo
:
it
was
all
very
well
not
to
accept
Sir
*NL*
James
Chettam
,
but
the
idea
of
marrying
Mr.
Casaubon
!
Celia
felt
a
*NL*
sort
of
shame
mingled
with
a
sense
of
the
ludicrous
.
But
perhaps
Dodo
,
*NL*
if
she
were
really
bordering
on
such
an
extravagance
,
might
be
turned
*NL*
away
from
it
:
experience
had
often
shown
that
her
impressibility
might
*NL*
be
calculated
on
.
The
day
was
damp
,
and
they
were
not
going
to
walk
*NL*
out
,
so
they
both
went
up
to
their
sitting-room
;
and
there
Celia
*NL*
observed
that
Dorothea
,
instead
of
settling
down
with
her
usual
*NL*
diligent
interest
to
some
occupation
,
simply
leaned
her
elbow
on
an
*NL*
open
book
and
looked
out
of
the
window
at
the
great
cedar
silvered
with
*NL*
the
damp
.
She
herself
had
taken
up
the
making
of
a
toy
for
the
*NL*
curate
's
children
,
and
was
not
going
to
enter
on
any
subject
too
*NL*
precipitately
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
was
in
fact
thinking
that
it
was
desirable
for
Celia
to
know
*NL*
of
the
momentous
change
in
Mr.
Casaubon
's
position
since
he
had
last
*NL*
been
in
the
house
:
it
did
not
seem
fair
to
leave
her
in
ignorance
of
*NL*
what
would
necessarily
affect
her
attitude
towards
him
;
but
it
was
*NL*
impossible
not
to
shrink
from
telling
her
.
Dorothea
accused
herself
of
*NL*
some
meanness
in
this
timidity
:
it
was
always
odious
to
her
to
have
any
*NL*
small
fears
or
contrivances
about
her
actions
,
but
at
this
moment
she
*NL*
was
seeking
the
highest
aid
possible
that
she
might
not
dread
the
*NL*
corrosiveness
of
Celia
's
pretty
carnally
minded
prose
.
Her
reverie
was
*NL*
broken
,
and
the
difficulty
of
decision
banished
,
by
Celia
's
small
and
*NL*
rather
guttural
voice
speaking
in
its
usual
tone
,
of
a
remark
aside
or
*NL*
a
``
by
the
bye
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
any
one
else
coming
to
dine
besides
Mr.
Casaubon
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
that
I
know
of
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
there
is
some
one
else
.
Then
I
shall
not
hear
him
eat
his
soup
*NL*
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
there
remarkable
about
his
soup-eating
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
,
Dodo
,
ca
n't
you
hear
how
he
scrapes
his
spoon
?
And
he
always
*NL*
blinks
before
he
speaks
.
I
do
n't
know
whether
Locke
blinked
,
but
I
'm
*NL*
sure
I
am
sorry
for
those
who
sat
opposite
to
him
if
he
did
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Celia
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
with
emphatic
gravity
,
``
pray
do
n't
make
any
*NL*
more
observations
of
that
kind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
not
?
They
are
quite
true
,
''
returned
Celia
,
who
had
her
reasons
*NL*
for
persevering
,
though
she
was
beginning
to
be
a
little
afraid
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Many
things
are
true
which
only
the
commonest
minds
observe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
think
the
commonest
minds
must
be
rather
useful
.
I
think
it
is
*NL*
a
pity
Mr.
Casaubon
's
mother
had
not
a
commoner
mind
:
she
might
have
*NL*
taught
him
better
.
''
Celia
was
inwardly
frightened
,
and
ready
to
run
*NL*
away
,
now
she
had
hurled
this
light
javelin
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
's
feelings
had
gathered
to
an
avalanche
,
and
there
could
be
no
*NL*
further
preparation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
right
to
tell
you
,
Celia
,
that
I
am
engaged
to
marry
Mr.
*NL*
Casaubon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Perhaps
Celia
had
never
turned
so
pale
before
.
The
paper
man
she
was
*NL*
making
would
have
had
his
leg
injured
,
but
for
her
habitual
care
of
*NL*
whatever
she
held
in
her
hands
.
She
laid
the
fragile
figure
down
at
*NL*
once
,
and
sat
perfectly
still
for
a
few
moments
.
When
she
spoke
there
*NL*
was
a
tear
gathering
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Dodo
,
I
hope
you
will
be
happy
.
''
Her
sisterly
tenderness
could
not
*NL*
but
surmount
other
feelings
at
this
moment
,
and
her
fears
were
the
*NL*
fears
of
affection
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
was
still
hurt
and
agitated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
quite
decided
,
then
?
''
said
Celia
,
in
an
awed
under
tone
.
``
And
*NL*
uncle
knows
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
accepted
Mr.
Casaubon
's
offer
.
My
uncle
brought
me
the
letter
*NL*
that
contained
it
;
he
knew
about
it
beforehand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beg
your
pardon
,
if
I
have
said
anything
to
hurt
you
,
Dodo
,
''
said
*NL*
Celia
,
with
a
slight
sob
.
She
never
could
have
thought
that
she
should
*NL*
feel
as
she
did
.
There
was
something
funereal
in
the
whole
affair
,
and
*NL*
Mr.
Casaubon
seemed
to
be
the
officiating
clergyman
,
about
whom
it
*NL*
would
be
indecent
to
make
remarks
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
mind
,
Kitty
,
do
not
grieve
.
We
should
never
admire
the
same
*NL*
people
.
I
often
offend
in
something
of
the
same
way
;
I
am
apt
to
speak
*NL*
too
strongly
of
those
who
do
n't
please
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
spite
of
this
magnanimity
Dorothea
was
still
smarting
:
perhaps
as
*NL*
much
from
Celia
's
subdued
astonishment
as
from
her
small
criticisms
.
*NL*
Of
course
all
the
world
round
Tipton
would
be
out
of
sympathy
with
this
*NL*
marriage
.
Dorothea
knew
of
no
one
who
thought
as
she
did
about
life
*NL*
and
its
best
objects
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
before
the
evening
was
at
an
end
she
was
very
happy
.
In
*NL*
an
hour
's
tete-a-tete
with
Mr.
Casaubon
she
talked
to
him
with
more
*NL*
freedom
than
she
had
ever
felt
before
,
even
pouring
out
her
joy
at
the
*NL*
thought
of
devoting
herself
to
him
,
and
of
learning
how
she
might
best
*NL*
share
and
further
all
his
great
ends
.
Mr.
Casaubon
was
touched
with
an
*NL*
unknown
delight
-LRB-
what
man
would
not
have
been
?
-RRB-
at
this
childlike
*NL*
unrestrained
ardor
:
he
was
not
surprised
-LRB-
what
lover
would
have
been
?
-RRB-
*NL*
that
he
should
be
the
object
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
young
lady
--
Miss
Brooke
--
Dorothea
!
''
he
said
,
pressing
her
hand
*NL*
between
his
hands
,
``
this
is
a
happiness
greater
than
I
had
ever
*NL*
imagined
to
be
in
reserve
for
me
.
That
I
should
ever
meet
with
a
mind
*NL*
and
person
so
rich
in
the
mingled
graces
which
could
render
marriage
*NL*
desirable
,
was
far
indeed
from
my
conception
.
You
have
all
--
nay
,
more
*NL*
than
all
--
those
qualities
which
I
have
ever
regarded
as
the
*NL*
characteristic
excellences
of
womanhood
.
The
great
charm
of
your
sex
*NL*
is
its
capability
of
an
ardent
self-sacrificing
affection
,
and
herein
*NL*
we
see
its
fitness
to
round
and
complete
the
existence
of
our
own
.
*NL*
Hitherto
I
have
known
few
pleasures
save
of
the
severer
kind
:
my
*NL*
satisfactions
have
been
those
of
the
solitary
student
.
I
have
been
*NL*
little
disposed
to
gather
flowers
that
would
wither
in
my
hand
,
but
now
*NL*
I
shall
pluck
them
with
eagerness
,
to
place
them
in
your
bosom
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
No
speech
could
have
been
more
thoroughly
honest
in
its
intention
:
the
*NL*
frigid
rhetoric
at
the
end
was
as
sincere
as
the
bark
of
a
dog
,
or
the
*NL*
cawing
of
an
amorous
rook
.
Would
it
not
be
rash
to
conclude
that
there
*NL*
was
no
passion
behind
those
sonnets
to
Delia
which
strike
us
as
the
*NL*
thin
music
of
a
mandolin
?
*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
's
faith
supplied
all
that
Mr.
Casaubon
's
words
seemed
to
leave
*NL*
unsaid
:
what
believer
sees
a
disturbing
omission
or
infelicity
?
The
*NL*
text
,
whether
of
prophet
or
of
poet
,
expands
for
whatever
we
can
put
*NL*
into
it
,
and
even
his
bad
grammar
is
sublime
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
ignorant
--
you
will
quite
wonder
at
my
ignorance
,
''
said
*NL*
Dorothea
.
``
I
have
so
many
thoughts
that
may
be
quite
mistaken
;
and
now
*NL*
I
shall
be
able
to
tell
them
all
to
you
,
and
ask
you
about
them
.
But
,
''
*NL*
she
added
,
with
rapid
imagination
of
Mr.
Casaubon
's
probable
feeling
,
*NL*
``
I
will
not
trouble
you
too
much
;
only
when
you
are
inclined
to
listen
*NL*
to
me
.
You
must
often
be
weary
with
the
pursuit
of
subjects
in
your
*NL*
own
track
.
I
shall
gain
enough
if
you
will
take
me
with
you
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
should
I
be
able
now
to
persevere
in
any
path
without
your
*NL*
companionship
?
''
said
Mr.
Casaubon
,
kissing
her
candid
brow
,
and
feeling
*NL*
that
heaven
had
vouchsafed
him
a
blessing
in
every
way
suited
to
his
*NL*
peculiar
wants
.
He
was
being
unconsciously
wrought
upon
by
the
charms
*NL*
of
a
nature
which
was
entirely
without
hidden
calculations
either
for
*NL*
immediate
effects
or
for
remoter
ends
.
It
was
this
which
made
Dorothea
*NL*
so
childlike
,
and
,
according
to
some
judges
,
so
stupid
,
with
all
her
*NL*
reputed
cleverness
;
as
,
for
example
,
in
the
present
case
of
throwing
*NL*
herself
,
metaphorically
speaking
,
at
Mr.
Casaubon
's
feet
,
and
kissing
*NL*
his
unfashionable
shoe-ties
as
if
he
were
a
Protestant
Pope
.
She
was
*NL*
not
in
the
least
teaching
Mr.
Casaubon
to
ask
if
he
were
good
enough
*NL*
for
her
,
but
merely
asking
herself
anxiously
how
she
could
be
good
*NL*
enough
for
Mr.
Casaubon
.
Before
he
left
the
next
day
it
had
been
*NL*
decided
that
the
marriage
should
take
place
within
six
weeks
.
Why
not
?
*NL*
Mr.
Casaubon
's
house
was
ready
.
It
was
not
a
parsonage
,
but
a
*NL*
considerable
mansion
,
with
much
land
attached
to
it
.
The
parsonage
was
*NL*
inhabited
by
the
curate
,
who
did
all
the
duty
except
preaching
the
*NL*
morning
sermon
.

As
Mr.
Casaubon
's
carriage
was
passing
out
of
the
gateway
,
it
arrested
*NL*
the
entrance
of
a
pony
phaeton
driven
by
a
lady
with
a
servant
seated
*NL*
behind
.
It
was
doubtful
whether
the
recognition
had
been
mutual
,
for
*NL*
Mr.
Casaubon
was
looking
absently
before
him
;
but
the
lady
was
*NL*
quick-eyed
,
and
threw
a
nod
and
a
``
How
do
you
do
?
''
in
the
nick
of
time
.
*NL*
In
spite
of
her
shabby
bonnet
and
very
old
Indian
shawl
,
it
was
plain
*NL*
that
the
lodge-keeper
regarded
her
as
an
important
personage
,
from
the
*NL*
low
curtsy
which
was
dropped
on
the
entrance
of
the
small
phaeton
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Mrs.
Fitchett
,
how
are
your
fowls
laying
now
?
''
said
the
*NL*
high-colored
,
dark-eyed
lady
,
with
the
clearest
chiselled
utterance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pretty
well
for
laying
,
madam
,
but
they
've
ta'en
to
eating
their
eggs
:
*NL*
I
've
no
peace
o

mind
with
'em
at
all

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
the
cannibals
!
Better
sell
them
cheap
at
once

What
will
you
*NL*
sell
them

?
One
ca
n't

fowls
of
a
bad
character
at
a
high
*NL*
price

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

,
half-a-crown

I
could
n't
let
'em
go
,
not
under

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Half-a-crown
,
these
times
!
Come
now
--
for
the
Rector
's
chicken-broth
*NL*
on
a
Sunday
.
He
has
consumed
all
ours
that
I
can
spare
.
You
are
half
*NL*
paid
with
the
sermon
,
Mrs.
Fitchett
,
remember
that
.
Take
a
pair
of
*NL*
tumbler-pigeons
for
them
--
little
beauties
.
You
must
come
and
see
them
.
*NL*
You
have
no
tumblers
among
your
pigeons
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
madam
,
Master
Fitchett
shall
go
and
see
'em
after
work

He
's
*NL*
very
hot
on
new
sorts

oblige
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oblige
me

It
will
be
the
best
bargain

ever
made

A
pair
of
*NL*
church
pigeons

a
couple
of
wicked
Spanish
fowls
that
eat
their
own
*NL*
eggs
!
Do
n't
you
and
Fitchett
boast
too
much
,
that
is
all
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
phaeton
was
driven
onwards
with
the
last
words
,
leaving
Mrs.
*NL*
Fitchett
laughing
and
shaking
her
head
slowly
,
with
an
interjectional
*NL*
``
Sure_ly
_
,
sure_ly
_
!
''
--
from
which
it
might
be
inferred
that
she
would
*NL*
have
found
the
country-side
somewhat
duller
if
the
Rector
's
lady
had
*NL*
been
less
free-spoken
and
less
of
a
skinflint
.
Indeed
,
both
the
*NL*
farmers
and
laborers
in
the
parishes
of
Freshitt
and
Tipton
would
have
*NL*
felt
a
sad
lack
of
conversation
but
for
the
stories
about
what
Mrs.
*NL*
Cadwallader
said
and
did
:
a
lady
of
immeasurably
high
birth
,
descended
,
*NL*
as
it
were
,
from
unknown
earls
,
dim
as
the
crowd
of
heroic
shades
--
who
*NL*
pleaded
poverty
,
pared
down
prices
,
and
cut
jokes
in
the
most
*NL*
companionable
manner
,
though
with
a
turn
of
tongue
that
let
you
know
*NL*
who
she
was
.
Such
a
lady
gave
a
neighborliness
to
both
rank
and
*NL*
religion
,
and
mitigated
the
bitterness
of
uncommuted
tithe
.
A
much
*NL*
more
exemplary
character
with
an
infusion
of
sour
dignity
would
not
*NL*
have
furthered
their
comprehension
of
the
Thirty-nine
Articles
,
and
*NL*
would
have
been
less
socially
uniting
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Brooke
,
seeing
Mrs.
Cadwallader
's
merits
from
a
different
point
of
*NL*
view
,
winced
a
little
when
her
name
was
announced
in
the
library
,
where
*NL*
he
was
sitting
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
you
have
had
our
Lowick
Cicero
here
,
''
she
said
,
seating
herself
*NL*
comfortably
,
throwing
back
her
wraps
,
and
showing
a
thin
but
well-built
*NL*
figure
.
``
I
suspect
you
and
he
are
brewing
some
bad
polities

else
you
*NL*
would
not
be
seeing
so
much
of
the
lively
man

I
shall
inform

you

remember
you
are
both
suspicious
characters

you
took
Peel
's
*NL*
side
about
the
Catholic
Bill

I
shall
tell

that
you
are
*NL*
going
to
put
up
for
Middlemarch
on
the
Whig
side
when
old
Pinkerton
*NL*
resigns
,
and
that
Casaubon
is
going
to
help
you
in
an
underhand
manner
:
*NL*
going
to
bribe
the
voters
with
pamphlets
,
and
throw
open
the
*NL*
public-houses
to
distribute
them

Come

confess
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
of
the
sort

said
Mr.
Brooke
,
smiling
and
rubbing
his
*NL*
eye-glasses
,
but
really
blushing
a
little
at
the
impeachment
.
*NL*
``

enjoyed

prophetic

*NL*
``
I
do

said
Mr.

,
*NL*
with
an
air
of
smiling
indifference
,
but
feeling
rather
unpleasantly
*NL*
conscious
that
this
attack
of
Mrs.

had
opened
the
*NL*
defensive
campaign
to
which
certain
rash

had
exposed
him

Mr.

reflected
in

the

there

*NL*
Mr.

again
winced
inwardly

for
Dorothea

engagement
had
no
*NL*
sooner
been
decided
,
than
he
had
thought
of
Mrs.

*NL*
prospective
taunts

It
might
have
been
easy
for
ignorant
observers
to
*NL*
say
,
``
Quarrel

Mrs.
Cadwallader

but
where
is
a
country
gentleman
*NL*
to
go
who
quarrels
with
his
oldest
neighbors
?
Who
could
taste
the
fine
*NL*
flavor
in
the
name
of
Brooke
if
it
were
delivered
casually
,
like
wine
*NL*
without
a
seal

Certainly
a
man
can
only
be
cosmopolitan
up
to
a
*NL*
certain
point

*NL*
``

Chettam

said
Mr.

*NL*
much
relieved
to
see
through
the
window
that

coming
in

Celia
entered

blooming
from

the

saying

clergyman
,
and
made
myself
a
pitiable
object
*NL*
among
the
De
Bracys
--
obliged
to
get
my
coals
by
stratagem
,
and
pray
to
*NL*
heaven
for
my
salad
oil
.
However
,
Casaubon
has
money
enough
;
I
must
do
*NL*
him
that
justice
.
As
to
his
blood
,
I
suppose
the
family
quarterings
*NL*
are
three
cuttle-fish
sable
,
and
a
commentator
rampant
.
By
the
bye
,
*NL*
before
I
go
,
my
dear
,
I
must
speak
to
your
Mrs.
Carter
about
pastry
.
I
*NL*
want
to
send
my
young
cook
to
learn
of
her
.
Poor
people
with
four
*NL*
children
,
like
us
,
you
know
,
ca
n't
afford
to
keep
a
good
cook
.
I
have
*NL*
no
doubt
Mrs.
Carter
will
oblige
me
.
Sir
James
's
cook
is
a
perfect
*NL*
dragon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
less
than
an
hour
,
Mrs.
Cadwallader
had
circumvented
Mrs.
Carter
and
*NL*
driven
to
Freshitt
Hall
,
which
was
not
far
from
her
own
parsonage
,
her
*NL*
husband
being
resident
in
Freshitt
and
keeping
a
curate
in
Tipton
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
James
Chettam
had
returned
from
the
short
journey
which
had
kept
*NL*
him
absent
for
a
couple
of
days
,
and
had
changed
his
dress
,
intending
*NL*
to
ride
over
to
Tipton
Grange
.
His
horse
was
standing
at
the
door
when
*NL*
Mrs.
Cadwallader
drove
up
,
and
he
immediately
appeared
there
himself
,
*NL*
whip
in
hand
.
Lady
Chettam
had
not
yet
returned
,
but
Mrs.
*NL*
Cadwallader
's
errand
could
not
be
despatched
in
the
presence
of
grooms
,
*NL*
so
she
asked
to
be
taken
into
the
conservatory
close
by
,
to
look
at
the
*NL*
new
plants
;
and
on
coming
to
a
contemplative
stand
,
she
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
a
great
shock
for
you
;
I
hope
you
are
not
so
far
gone
in
love
*NL*
as
you
pretended
to
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
of
no
use
protesting
,
against
Mrs.
Cadwallader
's
way
of
putting
*NL*
things
.
But
Sir
James
's
countenance
changed
a
little
.
He
felt
a
vague
*NL*
alarm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
believe
Brooke
is
going
to
expose
himself
after
all
.
I
accused
*NL*
him
of
meaning
to
stand
for
Middlemarch
on
the
Liberal
side
,
and
he
*NL*
looked
silly
and
never
denied
it
--
talked
about
the
independent
line
,
*NL*
and
the
usual
nonsense
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
all
?
''
said
Sir
James
,
much
relieved
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
''
rejoined
Mrs.
Cadwallader
,
with
a
sharper
note
,
``
you
do
n't
mean
*NL*
to
say
that
you
would
like
him
to
turn
public
man
in
that
way
--
making
a
*NL*
sort
of
political
Cheap
Jack
of
himself
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
might
be
dissuaded
,
I
should
think
.
He
would
not
like
the
expense
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
what
I
told
him
.
He
is
vulnerable
to
reason
there
--
always
a
*NL*
few
grains
of
common-sense
in
an
ounce
of
miserliness
.
Miserliness
is
*NL*
a
capital
quality
to
run
in
families
;
it
's
the
safe
side
for
madness
to
*NL*
dip
on
.
And
there
must
be
a
little
crack
in
the
Brooke
family
,
else
we
*NL*
should
not
see
what
we
are
to
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
Brooke
standing
for
Middlemarch
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Worse
than
that
.
I
really
feel
a
little
responsible
.
I
always
told
*NL*
you
Miss
Brooke
would
be
such
a
fine
match
.
I
knew
there
was
a
great
*NL*
deal
of
nonsense
in
her
--
a
flighty
sort
of
Methodistical
stuff
.
But
*NL*
these
things
wear
out
of
girls
.
However
,
I
am
taken
by
surprise
for
*NL*
once
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
,
Mrs.
Cadwallader
?
''
said
Sir
James
.
His
fear
lest
*NL*
Miss
Brooke
should
have
run
away
to
join
the
Moravian
Brethren
,
or
some
*NL*
preposterous
sect
unknown
to
good
society
,
was
a
little
allayed
by
the
*NL*
knowledge
that
Mrs.
Cadwallader
always
made
the
worst
of
things
.
``
What
*NL*
has
happened
to
Miss
Brooke
?
Pray
speak
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
.
She
is
engaged
to
be
married
.
''
Mrs.
Cadwallader
paused
a
*NL*
few
moments
,
observing
the
deeply
hurt
expression
in
her
friend
's
face
,
*NL*
which
he
was
trying
to
conceal
by
a
nervous
smile
,
while
he
whipped
his
*NL*
boot
;
but
she
soon
added
,
``
Engaged
to
Casaubon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
James
let
his
whip
fall
and
stooped
to
pick
it
up
.
Perhaps
his
*NL*
face
had
never
before
gathered
so
much
concentrated
disgust
as
when
he
*NL*
turned
to
Mrs.
Cadwallader
and
repeated
,
``
Casaubon
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Even
so
.
You
know
my
errand
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
God
!
It
is
horrible
!
He
is
no
better
than
a
mummy
!

-LRB-
The
point
*NL*
of
view
has
to
be
allowed
for
,
as
that
of
a
blooming
and
disappointed
*NL*
rival
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
``

Mrs.
Cadwallader
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What

Sir

She
would
think
better
of
it
then

guardian
for

``
As

*NL*
``
Not

I
never

will
even
speak
well
of
the
bishop

though
I
tell

him
it
is
unnatural
in
a
beneficed

what
can
one
do
with

so
little

up

rid

would
have

stars
by

Between
ourselves

little
Celia
is
worth
two
of

and
likely
after
all
to
be
the
better

``
Oh

on

it
is
for

try

*NL*
``
Well

Humphrey
does

But
when
I
tell

if

when

exaggeration

Good-by

''
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
James
handed
Mrs.
Cadwallader
to
the
phaeton
,
and
then
jumped
on
*NL*
his
horse
.
He
was
not
going
to
renounce
his
ride
because
of
his
*NL*
friend
's
unpleasant
news
--
only
to
ride
the
faster
in
some
other
*NL*
direction
than
that
of
Tipton
Grange
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
why
on
earth
should
Mrs.
Cadwallader
have
been
at
all
busy
about
*NL*
Miss
Brooke
's
marriage
;
and
why
,
when
one
match
that
she
liked
to
think
*NL*
she
had
a
hand
in
was
frustrated
,
should
she
have
straightway
contrived
*NL*
the
preliminaries
of
another
?
Was
there
any
ingenious
plot
,
any
*NL*
hide-and-seek
course
of
action
,
which
might
be
detected
by
a
careful
*NL*
telescopic
watch
?
Not
at
all
:
a
telescope
might
have
swept
the
*NL*
parishes
of
Tipton
and
Freshitt
,
the
whole
area
visited
by
Mrs.
*NL*
Cadwallader
in
her
phaeton
,
without
witnessing
any
interview
that
could
*NL*
excite
suspicion
,
or
any
scene
from
which
she
did
not
return
with
the
*NL*
same
unperturbed
keenness
of
eye
and
the
same
high
natural
color
.
In
*NL*
fact
,
if
that
convenient
vehicle
had
existed
in
the
days
of
the
Seven
*NL*
Sages
,
one
of
them
would
doubtless
have
remarked
,
that
you
can
know
*NL*
little
of
women
by
following
them
about
in
their
pony-phaetons
.
Even
*NL*
with
a
microscope
directed
on
a
water-drop
we
find
ourselves
making
*NL*
interpretations
which
turn
out
to
be
rather
coarse
;
for
whereas
under
a
*NL*
weak
lens
you
may
seem
to
see
a
creature
exhibiting
an
active
voracity
*NL*
into
which
other
smaller
creatures
actively
play
as
if
they
were
so
*NL*
many
animated
tax-pennies
,
a
stronger
lens
reveals
to
you
certain
*NL*
tiniest
hairlets
which
make
vortices
for
these
victims
while
the
*NL*
swallower
waits
passively
at
his
receipt
of
custom
.
In
this
way
,
*NL*
metaphorically
speaking
,
a
strong
lens
applied
to
Mrs.
Cadwallader
's
*NL*
match-making
will
show
a
play
of
minute
causes
producing
what
may
be
*NL*
called
thought
and
speech
vortices
to
bring
her
the
sort
of
food
she
*NL*
needed
.
Her
life
was
rurally
simple
,
quite
free
from
secrets
either
*NL*
foul
,
dangerous
,
or
otherwise
important
,
and
not
consciously
affected
*NL*
by
the
great
affairs
of
the
world
.
All
the
more
did
the
affairs
of
the
*NL*
great
world
interest
her
,
when
communicated
in
the
letters
of
high-born
*NL*
relations
:
the
way
in
which
fascinating
younger
sons
had
gone
to
the
*NL*
dogs
by
marrying
their
mistresses
;
the
fine
old-blooded
idiocy
of
young
*NL*
Lord
Tapir
,
and
the
furious
gouty
humors
of
old
Lord
Megatherium
;
the
*NL*
exact
crossing
of
genealogies
which
had
brought
a
coronet
into
a
new
*NL*
branch
and
widened
the
relations
of
scandal
,
--
these
were
topics
of
*NL*
which
she
retained
details
with
the
utmost
accuracy
,
and
reproduced
*NL*
them
in
an
excellent
pickle
of
epigrams
,
which
she
herself
enjoyed
the
*NL*
more
because
she
believed
as
unquestionably
in
birth
and
no-birth
as
*NL*
she
did
in
game
and
vermin
.
She
would
never
have
disowned
any
one
on
*NL*
the
ground
of
poverty
:
a
De
Bracy
reduced
to
take
his
dinner
in
a
basin
*NL*
would
have
seemed
to
her
an
example
of
pathos
worth
exaggerating
,
and
I
*NL*
fear
his
aristocratic
vices
would
not
have
horrified
her
.
But
her
*NL*
feeling
towards
the
vulgar
rich
was
a
sort
of
religious
hatred
:
they
*NL*
had
probably
made
all
their
money
out
of
high
retail
prices
,
and
Mrs.
*NL*
Cadwallader
detested
high
prices
for
everything
that
was
not
paid
in
*NL*
kind
at
the
Rectory
:
such
people
were
no
part
of
God
's
design
in
making
*NL*
the
world
;
and
their
accent
was
an
affliction
to
the
ears
.
A
town
*NL*
where
such
monsters
abounded
was
hardly
more
than
a
sort
of
low
comedy
,
*NL*
which
could
not
be
taken
account
of
in
a
well-bred
scheme
of
the
*NL*
universe
.
Let
any
lady
who
is
inclined
to
be
hard
on
Mrs.
Cadwallader
*NL*
inquire
into
the
comprehensiveness
of
her
own
beautiful
views
,
and
be
*NL*
quite
sure
that
they
afford
accommodation
for
all
the
lives
which
have
*NL*
the
honor
to
coexist
with
hers
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
such
a
mind
,
active
as
phosphorus
,
biting
everything
that
came
*NL*
near
into
the
form
that
suited
it
,
how
could
Mrs.
Cadwallader
feel
that
*NL*
the
Miss
Brookes
and
their
matrimonial
prospects
were
alien
to
her
?
*NL*
especially
as
it
had
been
the
habit
of
years
for
her
to
scold
Mr.
*NL*
Brooke
with
the
friendliest
frankness
,
and
let
him
know
in
confidence
*NL*
that
she
thought
him
a
poor
creature
.
From
the
first
arrival
of
the
*NL*
young
ladies
in
Tipton
she
had
prearranged
Dorothea
's
marriage
with
Sir
*NL*
James
,
and
if
it
had
taken
place
would
have
been
quite
sure
that
it
was
*NL*
her
doing
:
that
it
should
not
take
place
after
she
had
preconceived
it
,
*NL*
caused
her
an
irritation
which
every
thinker
will
sympathize
with
.
She
*NL*
was
the
diplomatist
of
Tipton
and
Freshitt
,
and
for
anything
to
happen
*NL*
in
spite
of
her
was
an
offensive
irregularity
.
As
to
freaks
like
this
*NL*
of
Miss
Brooke
's
,
Mrs.
Cadwallader
had
no
patience
with
them
,
and
now
*NL*
saw
that
her
opinion
of
this
girl
had
been
infected
with
some
of
her
*NL*
husband
's
weak
charitableness
:
those
Methodistical
whims
,
that
air
of
*NL*
being
more
religious
than
the
rector
and
curate
together
,
came
from
a
*NL*
deeper
and
more
constitutional
disease
than
she
had
been
willing
to
*NL*
believe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
However
,
''
said
Mrs.
Cadwallader
,
first
to
herself
and
afterwards
to
*NL*
her
husband
,
``
I
throw
her
over
:
there
was
a
chance
,
if
she
had
married
*NL*
Sir
James
,
of
her
becoming
a
sane
,
sensible
woman
.
He
would
never
have
*NL*
contradicted
her
,
and
when
a
woman
is
not
contradicted
,
she
has
no
*NL*
motive
for
obstinacy
in
her
absurdities
.
But
now
I
wish
her
joy
of
her
*NL*
hair
shirt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
followed
that
Mrs.
Cadwallader
must
decide
on
another
match
for
Sir
*NL*
James
,
and
having
made
up
her
mind
that
it
was
to
be
the
younger
Miss
*NL*
Brooke
,
there
could
not
have
been
a
more
skilful
move
towards
the
*NL*
success
of
her
plan
than
her
hint
to
the
baronet
that
he
had
made
an
*NL*
impression
on
Celia
's
heart
.
For
he
was
not
one
of
those
gentlemen
who
*NL*
languish
after
the
unattainable
Sappho
's
apple
that
laughs
from
the
*NL*
topmost
bough
--
the
charms
which
*NL*
*NL*
``
Smile
like
the
knot
of
cowslips
on
the
cliff
,
*NL*
Not
to
be
come
at
by
the
willing
hand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
no
sonnets
to
write
,
and
it
could
not
strike
him
agreeably
that
*NL*
he
was
not
an
object
of
preference
to
the
woman
whom
he
had
preferred
.
*NL*
Already
the
knowledge
that
Dorothea
had
chosen
Mr.
Casaubon
had
bruised
*NL*
his
attachment
and
relaxed
its
hold
.
Although
Sir
James
was
a
*NL*
sportsman
,
he
had
some
other
feelings
towards
women
than
towards
grouse
*NL*
and
foxes
,
and
did
not
regard
his
future
wife
in
the
light
of
prey
,
*NL*
valuable
chiefly
for
the
excitements
of
the
chase
.
Neither
was
he
so
*NL*
well
acquainted
with
the
habits
of
primitive
races
as
to
feel
that
an
*NL*
ideal
combat
for
her
,
tomahawk
in
hand
,
so
to
speak
,
was
necessary
to
*NL*
the
historical
continuity
of
the
marriage-tie
.
On
the
contrary
,
having
*NL*
the
amiable
vanity
which
knits
us
to
those
who
are
fond
of
us
,
and
*NL*
disinclines
us
to
those
who
are
indifferent
,
and
also
a
good
grateful
*NL*
nature
,
the
mere
idea
that
a
woman
had
a
kindness
towards
him
spun
*NL*
little
threads
of
tenderness
from
out
his
heart
towards
hers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
it
happened
,
that
after
Sir
James
had
ridden
rather
fast
for
half
*NL*
an
hour
in
a
direction
away
from
Tipton
Grange
,
he
slackened
his
pace
,
*NL*
and
at
last
turned
into
a
road
which
would
lead
him
back
by
a
shorter
*NL*
cut
.
Various
feelings
wrought
in
him
the
determination
after
all
to
go
*NL*
to
the
Grange
to-day
as
if
nothing
new
had
happened
.
He
could
not
help
*NL*
rejoicing
that
he
had
never
made
the
offer
and
been
rejected
;
mere
*NL*
friendly
politeness
required
that
he
should
call
to
see
Dorothea
about
*NL*
the
cottages
,
and
now
happily
Mrs.
Cadwallader
had
prepared
him
to
*NL*
offer
his
congratulations
,
if
necessary
,
without
showing
too
much
*NL*
awkwardness
.
He
really
did
not
like
it
:
giving
up
Dorothea
was
very
*NL*
painful
to
him
;
but
there
was
something
in
the
resolve
to
make
this
*NL*
visit
forthwith
and
conquer
all
show
of
feeling
,
which
was
a
sort
of
*NL*
file-biting
and
counter-irritant
.
And
without
his
distinctly
*NL*
recognizing
the
impulse
,
there
certainly
was
present
in
him
the
sense
*NL*
that
Celia
would
be
there
,
and
that
he
should
pay
her
more
attention
*NL*
than
he
had
done
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
mortals
,
men
and
women
,
devour
many
a
disappointment
between
*NL*
breakfast
and
dinner-time
;
keep
back
the
tears
and
look
a
little
pale
*NL*
about
the
lips
,
and
in
answer
to
inquiries
say
,
``
Oh
,
nothing
!
''
Pride
*NL*
helps
us
;
and
pride
is
not
a
bad
thing
when
it
only
urges
us
to
hide
*NL*
our
own
hurts
--
not
to
hurt
others
.

CHAPTER
VII

*NL*
*NL*
``
Piacer
e
popone
*NL*
Vuol
la
sua
stagione
.
''
*NL*
--
Italian
Proverb
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Casaubon
,
as
might
be
expected
,
spent
a
great
deal
of
his
time
at
*NL*
the
Grange
in
these
weeks
,
and
the
hindrance
which
courtship
occasioned
*NL*
to
the
progress
of
his
great
work
--
the
Key
to
all
*NL*
Mythologies
--
naturally
made
him
look
forward
the
more
eagerly
to
the
*NL*
happy
termination
of
courtship
.
But
he
had
deliberately
incurred
the
*NL*
hindrance
,
having
made
up
his
mind
that
it
was
now
time
for
him
to
*NL*
adorn
his
life
with
the
graces
of
female
companionship
,
to
irradiate
*NL*
the
gloom
which
fatigue
was
apt
to
hang
over
the
intervals
of
studious
*NL*
labor
with
the
play
of
female
fancy
,
and
to
secure
in
this
,
his
*NL*
culminating
age
,
the
solace
of
female
tendance
for
his
declining
years
.
*NL*
Hence
he
determined
to
abandon
himself
to
the
stream
of
feeling
,
and
*NL*
perhaps
was
surprised
to
find
what
an
exceedingly
shallow
rill
it
was
.
*NL*
As
in
droughty
regions
baptism
by
immersion
could
only
be
performed
*NL*
symbolically
,
Mr.
Casaubon
found
that
sprinkling
was
the
utmost
*NL*
approach
to
a
plunge
which
his
stream
would
afford
him
;
and
he
*NL*
concluded
that
the
poets
had
much
exaggerated
the
force
of
masculine
*NL*
passion
.
Nevertheless
,
he
observed
with
pleasure
that
Miss
Brooke
*NL*
showed
an
ardent
submissive
affection
which
promised
to
fulfil
his
most
*NL*
agreeable
previsions
of
marriage
.
It
had
once
or
twice
crossed
his
*NL*
mind
that
possibly
there
was
some
deficiency
in
Dorothea
to
account
for
*NL*
the
moderation
of
his
abandonment
;
but
he
was
unable
to
discern
the
*NL*
deficiency
,
or
to
figure
to
himself
a
woman
who
would
have
pleased
him
*NL*
better
;
so
that
there
was
clearly
no
reason
to
fall
back
upon
but
the
*NL*
exaggerations
of
human
tradition
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Could
I
not
be
preparing
myself
now
to
be
more
useful
?
''
said
Dorothea
*NL*
to
him
,
one
morning
,
early
in
the
time
of
courtship
;
``
could
I
not
learn
*NL*
to
read
Latin
and
Greek
aloud
to
you
,
as
Milton
's
daughters
did
to
*NL*
their
father
,
without
understanding
what
they
read
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
fear
that
would
be
wearisome
to
you
,
''
said
Mr.
Casaubon
,
smiling
;
*NL*
``
and
,
indeed
,
if
I
remember
rightly
,
the
young
women
you
have
mentioned
*NL*
regarded
that
exercise
in
unknown
tongues
as
a
ground
for
rebellion
*NL*
against
the
poet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
but
in
the
first
place
they
were
very
naughty
girls
,
else
they
*NL*
would
have
been
proud
to
minister
to
such
a
father
;
and
in
the
second
*NL*
place
they
might
have
studied
privately
and
taught
themselves
to
*NL*
understand
what
they
read
,
and
then
it
would
have
been
interesting
.
I
*NL*
hope
you
do
n't
expect
me
to
be
naughty
and
stupid
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
expect
you
to
be
all
that
an
exquisite
young
lady
can
be
in
every
*NL*
possible
relation
of
life
.
Certainly
it
might
be
a
great
advantage
if
*NL*
you
were
able
to
copy
the
Greek
character
,
and
to
that
end
it
were
well
*NL*
to
begin
with
a
little
reading
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
seized
this
as
a
precious
permission
.
She
would
not
have
*NL*
asked
Mr.
Casaubon
at
once
to
teach
her
the
languages
,
dreading
of
all
*NL*
things
to
be
tiresome
instead
of
helpful
;
but
it
was
not
entirely
out
*NL*
of
devotion
to
her
future
husband
that
she
wished
to
know
Latin
and
*NL*
Greek
.
Those
provinces
of
masculine
knowledge
seemed
to
her
a
*NL*
standing-ground
from
which
all
truth
could
be
seen
more
truly
.
As
it
*NL*
was
,
she
constantly
doubted
her
own
conclusions
,
because
she
felt
her
*NL*
own
ignorance
:
how
could
she
be
confident
that
one-roomed
cottages
were
*NL*
not
for
the
glory
of
God
,
when
men
who
knew
the
classics
appeared
to
*NL*
conciliate
indifference
to
the
cottages
with
zeal
for
the
glory
?
*NL*
Perhaps
even
Hebrew
might
be
necessary
--
at
least
the
alphabet
and
a
few
*NL*
roots
--
in
order
to
arrive
at
the
core
of
things
,
and
judge
soundly
on
*NL*
the
social
duties
of
the
Christian
.
And
she
had
not
reached
that
point
*NL*
of
renunciation
at
which
she
would
have
been
satisfied
with
having
a
*NL*
wise
husband
:
she
wished
,
poor
child
,
to
be
wise
herself
.
Miss
Brooke
*NL*
was
certainly
very
naive
with
all
her
alleged
cleverness
.
Celia
,
whose
*NL*
mind
had
never
been
thought
too
powerful
,
saw
the
emptiness
of
other
*NL*
people
's
pretensions
much
more
readily
.
To
have
in
general
but
little
*NL*
feeling
,
seems
to
be
the
only
security
against
feeling
too
much
on
any
*NL*
particular
occasion
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
Mr.
Casaubon
consented
to
listen
and
teach
for
an
hour
*NL*
together
,
like
a
schoolmaster
of
little
boys
,
or
rather
like
a
lover
,
*NL*
to
whom
a
mistress
's
elementary
ignorance
and
difficulties
have
a
*NL*
touching
fitness
.
Few
scholars
would
have
disliked
teaching
the
*NL*
alphabet
under
such
circumstances
.
But
Dorothea
herself
was
a
little
*NL*
shocked
and
discouraged
at
her
own
stupidity
,
and
the
answers
she
got
*NL*
to
some
timid
questions
about
the
value
of
the
Greek
accents
gave
her
a
*NL*
painful
suspicion
that
here
indeed
there
might
be
secrets
not
capable
*NL*
of
explanation
to
a
woman
's
reason
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Brooke
had
no
doubt
on
that
point
,
and
expressed
himself
with
his
*NL*
usual
strength
upon
it
one
day
that
he
came
into
the
library
while
the
*NL*
reading
was
going
forward
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
but
now
,
Casaubon
,
such
deep
studies
,
classics
,
mathematics
,
*NL*
that
kind
of
thing
,
are
too
taxing
for
a
woman
--
too
taxing
,
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dorothea
is
learning
to
read
the
characters
simply
,
''
said
Mr.
*NL*
Casaubon
,
evading
the
question
.
``
She
had
the
very
considerate
thought
*NL*
of
saving
my
eyes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
well
,
without
understanding
,
you
know
--
that
may
not
be
so
bad
.
*NL*
But
there
is
a
lightness
about
the
feminine
mind
--
a
touch
and
*NL*
go
--
music
,
the
fine
arts
,
that
kind
of
thing
--
they
should
study
those
*NL*
up
to
a
certain
point
,
women
should
;
but
in
a
light
way
,
you
know
.
A
*NL*
woman
should
be
able
to
sit
down
and
play
you
or
sing
you
a
good
old
*NL*
English
tune
.
That
is
what
I
like
;
though
I
have
heard
most
*NL*
things
--
been
at
the
opera
in
Vienna
:
Gluck
,
Mozart
,
everything
of
that
*NL*
sort
.
But
I
'm
a
conservative
in
music
--
it
's
not
like
ideas
,
you
know
.
*NL*
I
stick
to
the
good
old
tunes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Casaubon
is
not
fond
of
the
piano
,
and
I
am
very
glad
he
is
not
,
''
*NL*
said
Dorothea
,
whose
slight
regard
for
domestic
music
and
feminine
fine
*NL*
art
must
be
forgiven
her
,
considering
the
small
tinkling
and
smearing
*NL*
in
which
they
chiefly
consisted
at
that
dark
period
.
She
smiled
and
*NL*
looked
up
at
her
betrothed
with
grateful
eyes
.
If
he
had
always
been
*NL*
asking
her
to
play
the
``
Last
Rose
of
Summer
,
''
she
would
have
required
*NL*
much
resignation
.
``
He
says
there
is
only
an
old
harpsichord
at
Lowick
,
*NL*
and
it
is
covered
with
books
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
there
you
are
behind
Celia
,
my
dear
.
Celia
,
now
,
plays
very
*NL*
prettily

and
is
always
ready
to
play
.
However
,
since
Casaubon
does
*NL*
not
like
it
,
you
are
all
right
.
But
it
's
a
pity
you
should
not
have
*NL*
little
recreations
of
that
sort
,
Casaubon
:
the
bow
always
strung
--
that
*NL*
kind
of
thing
,
you
know
--
will
not
do

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
could
look
on
it
in
the
light
of
a
recreation
to
have
my
ears
*NL*
teased
with
measured
noises
,
''
said
Mr.
Casaubon
.
``
A
tune
much
iterated
*NL*
has
the
ridiculous
effect
of
making
the
words
in
my
mind
perform
a
sort
*NL*
of
minuet
to
keep
time
--
an
effect
hardly
tolerable
,
I
imagine
,
after
*NL*
boyhood
.
As
to
the
grander
forms
of
music
,
worthy
to
accompany
solemn
*NL*
celebrations
,
and
even
to
serve
as
an
educating
influence
according
to
*NL*
the
ancient
conception
,
I
say
nothing
,
for
with
these
we
are
not
*NL*
immediately
concerned
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
but
music
of
that
sort
I
should
enjoy
,
''
said
Dorothea
.
``
When
we
*NL*
were
coming
home
from
Lausanne
my
uncle
took
us
to
hear
the
great
organ
*NL*
at
Freiberg
,
and
it
made
me
sob
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
kind
of
thing
is
not
healthy
,
my
dear
,
''
said
Mr.
Brooke
.
*NL*
``
Casaubon
,
she
will
be
in
your
hands
now
:
you
must
teach
my
niece
to
*NL*
take
things
more
quietly
,
eh
,
Dorothea
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
ended
with
a
smile
,
not
wishing
to
hurt
his
niece
,
but
really
*NL*
thinking
that
it
was
perhaps
better
for
her
to
be
early
married
to
so
*NL*
sober
a
fellow
as
Casaubon
,
since
she
would
not
hear
of
Chettam
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
wonderful
,
though
,
''
he
said
to
himself
as
he
shuffled
out
of
the
*NL*
room
--
``
it
is
wonderful
that
she
should
have
liked
him
.
However
,
the
*NL*
match
is
good
.
I
should
have
been
travelling
out
of
my
brief
to
have
*NL*
hindered
it
,
let
Mrs.
Cadwallader
say
what
she
will
.
He
is
pretty
*NL*
certain
to
be
a
bishop
,
is
Casaubon
.
That
was
a
very
seasonable
*NL*
pamphlet
of
his
on
the
Catholic
Question
:
--
a
deanery
at
least
.
They
*NL*
owe
him
a
deanery
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
here
I
must
vindicate
a
claim
to
philosophical
reflectiveness
,
by
*NL*
remarking
that
Mr.
Brooke
on
this
occasion
little
thought
of
the
*NL*
Radical
speech
which
,
at
a
later
period
,
he
was
led
to
make
on
the
*NL*
incomes
of
the
bishops
.
What
elegant
historian
would
neglect
a
*NL*
striking
opportunity
for
pointing
out
that
his
heroes
did
not
foresee
*NL*
the
history
of
the
world
,
or
even
their
own
actions
?
--
For
example
,
that
*NL*
Henry
of
Navarre
,
when
a
Protestant
baby
,
little
thought
of
being
a
*NL*
Catholic
monarch
;
or
that
Alfred
the
Great
,
when
he
measured
his
*NL*
laborious
nights
with
burning
candles
,
had
no
idea
of
future
gentlemen
*NL*
measuring
their
idle
days
with
watches
.
Here
is
a
mine
of
truth
,
*NL*
which
,
however
vigorously
it
may
be
worked
,
is
likely
to
outlast
our
*NL*
coal
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
of
Mr.
Brooke
I
make
a
further
remark
perhaps
less
warranted
by
*NL*
precedent
--
namely
,
that
if
he
had
foreknown
his
speech
,
it
might
not
*NL*
have
made
any
great
difference
.
To
think
with
pleasure
of
his
niece
's
*NL*
husband
having
a
large
ecclesiastical
income
was
one
thing
--
to
make
a
*NL*
Liberal
speech
was
another
thing
;
and
it
is
a
narrow
mind
which
can
not
*NL*
look
at
a
subject
from
various
points
of
view
.

CHAPTER
VIII
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
rescue
her
!
I
am
her
brother
now
,
*NL*
And
you
her
father
.
Every
gentle
maid
*NL*
Should
have
a
guardian
in
each
gentleman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
wonderful
to
Sir
James
Chettam
how
well
he
continued
to
like
*NL*
going
to
the
Grange
after
he
had
once
encountered
the
difficulty
of
*NL*
seeing
Dorothea
for
the
first
time
in
the
light
of
a
woman
who
was
*NL*
engaged
to
another
man
.
Of
course
the
forked
lightning
seemed
to
pass
*NL*
through
him
when
he
first
approached
her
,
and
he
remained
conscious
*NL*
throughout
the
interview
of
hiding
uneasiness
;
but
,
good
as
he
was
,
it
*NL*
must
be
owned
that
his
uneasiness
was
less
than
it
would
have
been
if
*NL*
he
had
thought
his
rival
a
brilliant
and
desirable
match
.
He
had
no
*NL*
sense
of
being
eclipsed
by
Mr.
Casaubon
;
he
was
only
shocked
that
*NL*
Dorothea
was
under
a
melancholy
illusion
,
and
his
mortification
lost
*NL*
some
of
its
bitterness
by
being
mingled
with
compassion
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
while
Sir
James
said
to
himself
that
he
had
completely
*NL*
resigned
her
,
since
with
the
perversity
of
a
Desdemona
she
had
not
*NL*
affected
a
proposed
match
that
was
clearly
suitable
and
according
to
*NL*
nature
;
he
could
not
yet
be
quite
passive
under
the
idea
of
her
*NL*
engagement
to
Mr.
Casaubon
.
On
the
day
when
he
first
saw
them
together
*NL*
in
the
light
of
his
present
knowledge
,
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
not
*NL*
taken
the
affair
seriously
enough
.
Brooke
was
really
culpable
;
he
*NL*
ought
to
have
hindered
it
.
Who
could
speak
to
him
?
Something
might
be
*NL*
done
perhaps
even
now
,
at
least
to
defer
the
marriage
.
On
his
way
home
*NL*
he
turned
into
the
Rectory
and
asked
for
Mr.
Cadwallader
.
Happily
,
the
*NL*
Rector
was
at
home
,
and
his
visitor
was
shown
into
the
study
,
where
all
*NL*
the
fishing
tackle
hung
.
But
he
himself
was
in
a
little
room
*NL*
adjoining
,
at
work
with
his
turning
apparatus
,
and
he
called
to
the
*NL*
baronet
to
join
him
there
.
The
two
were
better
friends
than
any
other
*NL*
landholder
and
clergyman
in
the
county
--
a
significant
fact
which
was
in
*NL*
agreement
with
the
amiable
expression
of
their
faces
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Cadwallader
was
a
large
man
,
with
full
lips
and
a
sweet
smile
;
very
*NL*
plain
and
rough
in
his
exterior
,
but
with
that
solid
imperturbable
ease
*NL*
and
good-humor
which
is
infectious
,
and
like
great
grassy
hills
in
the
*NL*
sunshine
,
quiets
even
an
irritated
egoism
,
and
makes
it
rather
ashamed
*NL*
of
itself
.
``
Well
,
how
are
you
?
''
he
said
,
showing
a
hand
not
quite
fit
*NL*
to
be
grasped
.
``
Sorry
I
missed
you
before
.
Is
there
anything
*NL*
particular
?
You
look
vexed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
James
's
brow
had
a
little
crease
in
it
,
a
little
depression
of
the
*NL*
eyebrow
,
which
he
seemed
purposely
to
exaggerate
as
he
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
only
this
conduct
of
Brooke
's
.
I
really
think
somebody
should
*NL*
speak
to
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
meaning
to
stand
?
''
said
Mr.
Cadwallader
,
going
on
with
the
*NL*
arrangement
of
the
reels
which
he
had
just
been
turning
.
``
I
hardly
*NL*
think
he
means
it
.
But
where
's
the
harm
,
if
he
likes
it
?
Any
one
who
*NL*
objects
to
Whiggery
should
be
glad
when
the
Whigs
do
n't
put
up
the
*NL*
strongest
fellow
.
They
wo
n't
overturn
the
Constitution
with
our
friend
*NL*
Brooke
's
head
for
a
battering
ram
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
do
n't
mean
that
,
''
said
Sir
James
,
who
,
after
putting
down
his
*NL*
hat
and
throwing
himself
into
a
chair
,
had
begun
to
nurse
his
leg
and
*NL*
examine
the
sole
of
his
boot
with
much
bitterness
.
``
I
mean
this
*NL*
marriage
.
I
mean
his
letting
that
blooming
young
girl
marry
Casaubon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
matter
with
Casaubon
?
I
see
no
harm
in
him
--
if
the
girl
*NL*
likes
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
too
young
to
know
what
she
likes
.
Her
guardian
ought
to
*NL*
interfere
.
He
ought
not
to
allow
the
thing
to
be
done
in
this
headlong
*NL*
manner
.
I
wonder
a
man
like
you
,
Cadwallader
--
a
man
with
daughters
,
*NL*
can
look
at
the
affair
with
indifference
:
and
with
such
a
heart
as
*NL*
yours
!
Do
think
seriously
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
joking
;
I
am
as
serious
as
possible
,
''
said
the
Rector
,
with
a
*NL*
provoking
little
inward
laugh
.
``
You
are
as
bad
as
Elinor
.
She
has
*NL*
been
wanting
me
to
go
and
lecture
Brooke
;
and
I
have
reminded
her
that
*NL*
her
friends
had
a
very
poor
opinion
of
the
match
she
made
when
she
*NL*
married
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
look
at
Casaubon
,
''
said
Sir
James
,
indignantly
.
``
He
must
be
*NL*
fifty
,
and
I
do
n't
believe
he
could
ever
have
been
much
more
than
the
*NL*
shadow
of
a
man
.
Look
at
his
legs
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Confound
you
handsome
young
fellows
!
you
think
of
having
it
all
your
*NL*
own
way
in
the
world
.
You
do
n't
under
stand
women
.
They
do
n't
admire
*NL*
you
half
so
much
as
you
admire
yourselves
.
Elinor
used
to
tell
her
*NL*
sisters
that
she
married
me
for
my
ugliness
--
it
was
so
various
and
*NL*
amusing
that
it
had
quite
conquered
her
prudence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
!
it
was
easy
enough
for
a
woman
to
love
you
.
But
this
is
no
*NL*
question
of
beauty
.
I
do
n't
_
like
_
Casaubon
.
''
This
was
Sir
James
's
*NL*
strongest
way
of
implying
that
he
thought
ill
of
a
man
's
character
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
what
do
you
know
against
him
?
''
said
the
Rector
laying
down
his
*NL*
reels
,
and
putting
his
thumbs
into
his
armholes
with
an
air
of
*NL*
attention
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
James
paused
.
He
did
not
usually
find
it
easy
to
give
his
reasons
:
*NL*
it
seemed
to
him
strange
that
people
should
not
know
them
without
being
*NL*
told
,
since
he
only
felt
what
was
reasonable
.
At
last
he
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Cadwallader
,
has
he
got
any
heart
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
yes
.
I
do
n't
mean
of
the
melting
sort
,
but
a
sound
kernel
,
*NL*
_
that
_
you
may
be
sure
of
.
He
is
very
good
to
his
poor
relations
:
*NL*
pensions
several
of
the
women
,
and
is
educating
a
young
fellow
at
a
*NL*
good
deal
of
expense
.
Casaubon
acts
up
to
his
sense
of
justice
.
His
*NL*
mother
's
sister
made
a
bad
match
--
a
Pole
,
I
think
--
lost
herself
--
at
any
*NL*
rate
was
disowned
by
her
family
.
If
it
had
not
been
for
that
,
Casaubon
*NL*
would
not
have
had
so
much
money
by
half
.
I
believe
he
went
himself
to
*NL*
find
out
his
cousins
,
and
see
what
he
could
do
for
them
.
Every
man
*NL*
would
not
ring
so
well
as
that
,
if
you
tried
his
metal
.
_
You
_
would
,
*NL*
Chettam
;
but
not
every
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
said
Sir
James
,
coloring
.
``
I
am
not
so
sure
of
*NL*
myself
.
''
He
paused
a
moment
,
and
then
added
,
``
That
was
a
right
thing
*NL*
for
Casaubon
to
do
.
But
a
man
may
wish
to
do
what
is
right
,
and
yet
be
*NL*
a
sort
of
parchment
code
.
A
woman
may
not
be
happy
with
him
.
And
I
*NL*
think
when
a
girl
is
so
young
as
Miss
Brooke
is
,
her
friends
ought
to
*NL*
interfere
a
little
to
hinder
her
from
doing
anything
foolish
.
You
*NL*
laugh
,
because
you
fancy
I
have
some
feeling
on
my
own
account
.
But
*NL*
upon
my
honor
,
it
is
not
that
.
I
should
feel
just
the
same
if
I
were
*NL*
Miss
Brooke
's
brother
or
uncle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
but
what
should
you
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
say
that
the
marriage
must
not
be
decided
on
until
she
was
of
*NL*
age
.
And
depend
upon
it
,
in
that
case
,
it
would
never
come
off
.
I
*NL*
wish
you
saw
it
as
I
do
--
I
wish
you
would
talk
to
Brooke
about
it

''
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
James
rose
as
he
was
finishing
his
sentence
,
for
he
saw
Mrs.
*NL*
Cadwallader
entering
from
the
study
.
She
held
by
the
hand
her
youngest
*NL*
girl
,
about
five
years
old
,
who
immediately
ran
to
papa
,
and
was
made
*NL*
comfortable
on
his
knee
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hear
what
you
are
talking
about

''
said
the
wife
.
``
But
you
will
make

no

long

everybody
is
what
he
ought
to
be

Bless
you

Casaubon
has
got
a

trout-stream

there
be
a
better
fellow

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

there
is
something
in
that

said
the
Rector
,
with
his
quiet
,
*NL*
inward
laugh
.
``
It
is
a
very
good
quality

a
man
to
have
a
*NL*
trout-stream

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
seriously

''
said
Sir
James
,
whose
vexation
had
not
yet
spent
*NL*
itself
,
``
do
n't
you
think
the
Rector
might
do
some
good
by
speaking
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
told
you
beforehand
what

answered
Mrs.

Cadwallader

lifting
up
her
eyebrows
.
``
I
have
done
what
I
could

I

wash
my

*NL*
*NL*
``
In

the

looking
rather
grave

nonsensical

*NL*
*NL*
``
He
might

surer

I

took
on
the

Catholic

that
was
unexpected

has
always
been
civil

``

*NL*
*NL*
``

as
good

is
a
scholarly

creditable
to

Some

Radical
fellow
speechifying
at
Middlemarch
said
Casaubon
was
the

learned
straw-chopping

see
that

The
Rector
ended
with
*NL*
his
silent
laugh
.
He
always
saw
the
joke
of
any
satire
against
*NL*
himself
.
His
conscience
was
large
and
easy
,
like
the
rest
of
him
:
it
*NL*
did
only
what
it
could
do
without
any
trouble
.
*NL*
*NL*
Clearly
,
there
would
be
no
interference
with
Miss
Brooke
's
marriage
*NL*
through
Mr.
Cadwallader
;
and
Sir
James
felt
with
some
sadness
that
she
*NL*
was
to
have
perfect
liberty
of
misjudgment
.
It
was
a
sign
of
his
good
*NL*
disposition
that
he
did
not
slacken
at
all
in
his
intention
of
carrying
*NL*
out
Dorothea
's
design
of
the
cottages
.
Doubtless
this
persistence
was
*NL*
the
best
course
for
his
own
dignity
:
but
pride
only
helps
us
to
be
*NL*
generous
;
it
never
makes
us
so
,
any
more
than
vanity
makes
us
witty
.
*NL*
She
was
now
enough
aware
of
Sir
James
's
position
with
regard
to
her
,
to
*NL*
appreciate
the
rectitude
of
his
perseverance
in
a
landlord
's
duty
,
to
*NL*
which
he
had
at
first
been
urged
by
a
lover
's
complaisance
,
and
her
*NL*
pleasure
in
it
was
great
enough
to
count
for
something
even
in
her
*NL*
present
happiness
.
Perhaps
she
gave
to
Sir
James
Chettam
's
cottages
*NL*
all
the
interest
she
could
spare
from
Mr.
Casaubon
,
or
rather
from
the
*NL*
symphony
of
hopeful
dreams
,
admiring
trust
,
and
passionate
self
*NL*
devotion
which
that
learned
gentleman
had
set
playing
in
her
soul
.
*NL*
Hence
it
happened
that
in
the
good
baronet
's
succeeding
visits
,
while
*NL*
he
was
beginning
to
pay
small
attentions
to
Celia
,
he
found
himself
*NL*
talking
with
more
and
more
pleasure
to
Dorothea
.
She
was
perfectly
*NL*
unconstrained
and
without
irritation
towards
him
now
,
and
he
was
*NL*
gradually
discovering
the
delight
there
is
in
frank
kindness
and
*NL*
companionship
between
a
man
and
a
woman
who
have
no
passion
to
hide
or
*NL*
confess
.

CHAPTER
IX
.
*NL*
*NL*
1st
Gent
.
An
ancient
land
in
ancient
oracles
*NL*
Is
called
``
law-thirsty
''
:
all
the
struggle
there
*NL*
Was
after
order
and
a
perfect
rule
.
*NL*
Pray
,
where
lie
such
lands
now
?
...
*NL*
2d
Gent
.
Why
,
where
they
lay
of
old
--
in
human
souls
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Casaubon
's
behavior
about
settlements
was
highly
satisfactory
to
*NL*
Mr.
Brooke
,
and
the
preliminaries
of
marriage
rolled
smoothly
along
,
*NL*
shortening
the
weeks
of
courtship
.
The
betrothed
bride
must
see
her
*NL*
future
home
,
and
dictate
any
changes
that
she
would
like
to
have
made
*NL*
there
.
A
woman
dictates
before
marriage
in
order
that
she
may
have
an
*NL*
appetite
for
submission
afterwards
.
And
certainly
,
the
mistakes
that
*NL*
we
male
and
female
mortals
make
when
we
have
our
own
way
might
fairly
*NL*
raise
some
wonder
that
we
are
so
fond
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
a
gray
but
dry
November
morning
Dorothea
drove
to
Lowick
in
company
*NL*
with
her
uncle
and
Celia
.
Mr.
Casaubon
's
home
was
the
manor-house
.
*NL*
Close
by
,
visible
from
some
parts
of
the
garden
,
was
the
little
church
,
*NL*
with
the
old
parsonage
opposite
.
In
the
beginning
of
his
career
,
Mr.
*NL*
Casaubon
had
only
held
the
living
,
but
the
death
of
his
brother
had
put
*NL*
him
in
possession
of
the
manor
also
.
It
had
a
small
park
,
with
a
fine
*NL*
old
oak
here
and
there
,
and
an
avenue
of
limes
towards
the
southwest
*NL*
front
,
with
a
sunk
fence
between
park
and
pleasure-ground
,
so
that
from
*NL*
the
drawing-room
windows
the
glance
swept
uninterruptedly
along
a
slope
*NL*
of
greensward
till
the
limes
ended
in
a
level
of
corn
and
pastures
,
*NL*
which
often
seemed
to
melt
into
a
lake
under
the
setting
sun
.
This
was
*NL*
the
happy
side
of
the
house
,
for
the
south
and
east
looked
rather
*NL*
melancholy
even
under
the
brightest
morning
.
The
grounds
here
were
*NL*
more
confined
,
the
flower-beds
showed
no
very
careful
tendance
,
and
*NL*
large
clumps
of
trees
,
chiefly
of
sombre
yews
,
had
risen
high
,
not
ten
*NL*
yards
from
the
windows
.
The
building
,
of
greenish
stone
,
was
in
the
*NL*
old
English
style
,
not
ugly
,
but
small-windowed
and
melancholy-looking
:
*NL*
the
sort
of
house
that
must
have
children
,
many
flowers
,
open
windows
,
*NL*
and
little
vistas
of
bright
things
,
to
make
it
seem
a
joyous
home
.
In
*NL*
this
latter
end
of
autumn
,
with
a
sparse
remnant
of
yellow
leaves
*NL*
falling
slowly
athwart
the
dark
evergreens
in
a
stillness
without
*NL*
sunshine
,
the
house
too
had
an
air
of
autumnal
decline
,
and
Mr.
*NL*
Casaubon
,
when
he
presented
himself
,
had
no
bloom
that
could
be
thrown
*NL*
into
relief
by
that
background
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
dear
!
''
Celia
said
to
herself
,
``
I
am
sure
Freshitt
Hall
would
have
*NL*
been
pleasanter
than
this
.
''
She
thought
of
the
white
freestone
,
the
*NL*
pillared
portico
,
and
the
terrace
full
of
flowers
,
Sir
James
smiling
*NL*
above
them
like
a
prince
issuing
from
his
enchantment
in
a
rose-bush
,
*NL*
with
a
handkerchief
swiftly
metamorphosed
from
the
most
delicately
*NL*
odorous
petals
--
Sir
James
,
who
talked
so
agreeably
,
always
about
things
*NL*
which
had
common-sense
in
them
,
and
not
about
learning
!
Celia
had
*NL*
those
light
young
feminine
tastes
which
grave
and
weatherworn
gentlemen
*NL*
sometimes
prefer
in
a
wife
;
but
happily
Mr.
Casaubon
's
bias
had
been
*NL*
different
,
for
he
would
have
had
no
chance
with
Celia
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
,
on
the
contrary
,
found
the
house
and
grounds
all
that
she
*NL*
could
wish
:
the
dark
book-shelves
in
the
long
library
,
the
carpets
and
*NL*
curtains
with
colors
subdued
by
time
,
the
curious
old
maps
and
*NL*
bird
's
-
eye
views
on
the
walls
of
the
corridor
,
with
here
and
there
an
*NL*
old
vase
below
,
had
no
oppression
for
her
,
and
seemed
more
cheerful
*NL*
than
the
easts
and
pictures
at
the
Grange
,
which
her
uncle
had
long
ago
*NL*
brought
home
from
his
travels
--
they
being
probably
among
the
ideas
he
*NL*
had
taken
in
at
one
time
.
To
poor
Dorothea
these
severe
classical
*NL*
nudities
and
smirking
Renaissance-Correggiosities
were
painfully
*NL*
inexplicable
,
staring
into
the
midst
of
her
Puritanic
conceptions
:
she
*NL*
had
never
been
taught
how
she
could
bring
them
into
any
sort
of
*NL*
relevance
with
her
life
.
But
the
owners
of
Lowick
apparently
had
not
*NL*
been
travellers
,
and
Mr.
Casaubon
's
studies
of
the
past
were
not
*NL*
carried
on
by
means
of
such
aids
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
walked
about
the
house
with
delightful
emotion
.
Everything
*NL*
seemed
hallowed
to
her
:
this
was
to
be
the
home
of
her
wifehood
,
and
*NL*
she
looked
up
with
eyes
full
of
confidence
to
Mr.
Casaubon
when
he
drew
*NL*
her
attention
specially
to
some
actual
arrangement
and
asked
her
if
she
*NL*
would
like
an
alteration
.
All
appeals
to
her
taste
she
met
gratefully
,
*NL*
but
saw
nothing
to
alter
.
His
efforts
at
exact
courtesy
and
formal
*NL*
tenderness
had
no
defect
for
her
.
She
filled
up
all
blanks
with
*NL*
unmanifested
perfections
,
interpreting
him
as
she
interpreted
the
works
*NL*
of
Providence
,
and
accounting
for
seeming
discords
by
her
own
deafness
*NL*
to
the
higher
harmonies
.
And
there
are
many
blanks
left
in
the
weeks
*NL*
of
courtship
which
a
loving
faith
fills
with
happy
assurance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
my
dear
Dorothea
,
I
wish
you
to
favor
me
by
pointing
out
which
*NL*
room
you
would
like
to
have
as
your
boudoir
,
''
said
Mr.
Casaubon
,
*NL*
showing
that
his
views
of
the
womanly
nature
were
sufficiently
large
to
*NL*
include
that
requirement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
very
kind
of
you
to
think
of
that
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
``
but
I
assure
*NL*
you
I
would
rather
have
all
those
matters
decided
for
me
.
I
shall
be
*NL*
much
happier
to
take
everything
as
it
is
--
just
as
you
have
been
used
to
*NL*
have
it
,
or
as
you
will
yourself
choose
it
to
be
.
I
have
no
motive
for
*NL*
wishing
anything
else
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Dodo
,
''
said
Celia
,
``
will
you
not
have
the
bow-windowed
room
*NL*
up-stairs
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Casaubon
led
the
way
thither
.
The
bow-window
looked
down
the
*NL*
avenue
of
limes
;
the
furniture
was
all
of
a
faded
blue
,
and
there
were
*NL*
miniatures
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
with
powdered
hair
hanging
in
a
*NL*
group
.
A
piece
of
tapestry
over
a
door
also
showed
a
blue-green
world
*NL*
with
a
pale
stag
in
it
.
The
chairs
and
tables
were
thin-legged
and
*NL*
easy
to
upset
.
It
was
a
room
where
one
might
fancy
the
ghost
of
a
*NL*
tight-laced
lady
revisiting
the
scene
of
her
embroidery
.
A
light
*NL*
bookcase
contained
duodecimo
volumes
of
polite
literature
in
calf
,
*NL*
completing
the
furniture
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Mr.
Brooke
,
``
this
would
be
a
pretty
room
with
some
new
*NL*
hangings
,
sofas
,
and
that
sort
of
thing
.
A
little
bare
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
uncle
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
eagerly
.
``
Pray
do
not
speak
of
altering
*NL*
anything
.
There
are
so
many
other
things
in
the
world
that
want
*NL*
altering
--
I
like
to
take
these
things
as
they
are
.
And
you
like
them
*NL*
as
they
are
,
do
n't
you
?
''
she
added
,
looking
at
Mr.
Casaubon
.
``
Perhaps
*NL*
this
was
your
mother
's
room
when
she
was
young
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
,
''
he
said
,
with
his
slow
bend
of
the
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
your
mother
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
who
had
turned
to
examine
the
*NL*
group
of
miniatures
.
``
It
is
like
the
tiny
one
you
brought
me
;
only
,
I
*NL*
should
think
,
a
better
portrait
.
And
this
one
opposite
,
who
is
this
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Her
elder
sister
.
They
were
,
like
you
and
your
sister
,
the
only
two
*NL*
children
of
their
parents
,
who
hang
above
them
,
you
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
sister
is
pretty
,
''
said
Celia
,
implying
that
she
thought
less
*NL*
favorably
of
Mr.
Casaubon
's
mother
.
It
was
a
new
opening
to
Celia
's
*NL*
imagination
,
that
he
came
of
a
family
who
had
all
been
young
in
their
*NL*
time
--
the
ladies
wearing
necklaces
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
peculiar
face
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
looking
closely
.
``
Those
deep
*NL*
gray
eyes
rather
near
together
--
and
the
delicate
irregular
nose
with
a
*NL*
sort
of
ripple
in
it
--
and
all
the
powdered
curls
hanging
backward
.
*NL*
Altogether
it
seems
to
me
peculiar
rather
than
pretty
.
There
is
not
*NL*
even
a
family
likeness
between
her
and
your
mother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
And
they
were
not
alike
in
their
lot
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
did
not
mention
her
to
me
,
''
said
Dorothea
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
aunt
made
an
unfortunate
marriage
.
I
never
saw
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
wondered
a
little
,
but
felt
that
it
would
be
indelicate
just
*NL*
then
to
ask
for
any
information
which
Mr.
Casaubon
did
not
proffer
,
and
*NL*
she
turned
to
the
window
to
admire
the
view
.
The
sun
had
lately
*NL*
pierced
the
gray
,
and
the
avenue
of
limes
cast
shadows
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
we
not
walk
in
the
garden
now
?
''
said
Dorothea
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
would
like
to
see
the
church
,
you
know
,
''
said
Mr.
Brooke
.
``
It
*NL*
is
a
droll
little
church
.
And
the
village
.
It
all
lies
in
a
*NL*
nut-shell
.
By
the
way
,
it
will
suit
you
,
Dorothea
;
for
the
cottages
are
*NL*
like
a
row
of
alms-houses
--
little
gardens
,
gilly-flowers
,
that
sort
of
*NL*
thing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
please
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
looking
at
Mr.
Casaubon
,
``
I
should
like
*NL*
to
see
all
that
.
''
She
had
got
nothing
from
him
more
graphic
about
the
*NL*
Lowick
cottages
than
that
they
were
``
not
bad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
soon
on
a
gravel
walk
which
led
chiefly
between
grassy
*NL*
borders
and
clumps
of
trees
,
this
being
the
nearest
way
to
the
church
,
*NL*
Mr.
Casaubon
said
.
At
the
little
gate
leading
into
the
churchyard
*NL*
there
was
a
pause
while
Mr.
Casaubon
went
to
the
parsonage
close
by
to
*NL*
fetch
a
key
.
Celia
,
who
had
been
hanging
a
little
in
the
rear
,
came
up
*NL*
presently
,
when
she
saw
that
Mr.
Casaubon
was
gone
away
,
and
said
in
*NL*
her
easy
staccato
,
which
always
seemed
to
contradict
the
suspicion
of
*NL*
any
malicious
intent
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
,
Dorothea
,
I
saw
some
one
quite
young
coming
up
one
of
the
*NL*
walks
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
astonishing
,
Celia
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
may
be
a
young
gardener
,
you
know
--
why
not
?
''
said
Mr.
Brooke
.
*NL*
``
I
told
Casaubon
he
should
change
his
gardener
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
not
a
gardener
,
''
said
Celia
;
``
a
gentleman
with
a
sketch-book
.
He
*NL*
had
light-brown
curls
.
I
only
saw
his
back
.
But
he
was
quite
young
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
curate
's
son
,
perhaps
,
''
said
Mr.
Brooke
.
``
Ah
,
there
is
Casaubon
*NL*
again
,
and
Tucker
with
him
.
He
is
going
to
introduce
Tucker
.
You
*NL*
do
n't
know
Tucker
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Tucker
was
the
middle-aged
curate
,
one
of
the
``
inferior
clergy
,
''
*NL*
who
are
usually
not
wanting
in
sons
.
But
after
the
introduction
,
the
*NL*
conversation
did
not
lead
to
any
question
about
his
family
,
and
the
*NL*
startling
apparition
of
youthfulness
was
forgotten
by
every
one
but
*NL*
Celia
.
She
inwardly
declined
to
believe
that
the
light-brown
curls
and
*NL*
slim
figure
could
have
any
relationship
to
Mr.
Tucker
,
who
was
just
as
*NL*
old
and
musty-looking
as
she
would
have
expected
Mr.
Casaubon
's
curate
*NL*
to
be
;
doubtless
an
excellent
man
who
would
go
to
heaven
-LRB-
for
Celia
*NL*
wished
not
to
be
unprincipled
-RRB-
,
but
the
corners
of
his
mouth
were
so
*NL*
unpleasant
.
Celia
thought
with
some
dismalness
of
the
time
she
should
*NL*
have
to
spend
as
bridesmaid
at
Lowick
,
while
the
curate
had
probably
no
*NL*
pretty
little
children
whom
she
could
like
,
irrespective
of
principle
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Tucker
was
invaluable
in
their
walk
;
and
perhaps
Mr.
Casaubon
had
*NL*
not
been
without
foresight
on
this
head
,
the
curate
being
able
to
*NL*
answer
all
Dorothea
's
questions
about
the
villagers
and
the
other
*NL*
parishioners
.
Everybody
,
he
assured
her
,
was
well
off
in
Lowick
:
not
a
*NL*
cottager
in
those
double
cottages
at
a
low
rent
but
kept
a
pig
,
and
the
*NL*
strips
of
garden
at
the
back
were
well
tended
.
The
small
boys
wore
*NL*
excellent
corduroy
,
the
girls
went
out
as
tidy
servants
,
or
did
a
*NL*
little
straw-plaiting
at
home
:
no
looms
here
,
no
Dissent
;
and
though
*NL*
the
public
disposition
was
rather
towards
laying
by
money
than
towards
*NL*
spirituality
,
there
was
not
much
vice
.
The
speckled
fowls
were
so
*NL*
numerous
that
Mr.
Brooke
observed
,
``
Your
farmers
leave
some
barley
for
*NL*
the
women
to
glean
,
I
see
.
The
poor
folks
here
might
have
a
fowl
in
*NL*
their
pot
,
as
the
good
French
king
used
to
wish
for
all
his
people
.
*NL*
The
French
eat
a
good
many
fowls
--
skinny
fowls
,
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
it
was
a
very
cheap
wish
of
his
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
indignantly
.
*NL*
``
Are
kings
such
monsters
that
a
wish
like
that
must
be
reckoned
a
royal
*NL*
virtue
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
if
he
wished
them
a
skinny
fowl
,
''
said
Celia
,
``
that
would
not
be
*NL*
nice
.
But
perhaps
he
wished
them
to
have
fat
fowls
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
the
word
has
dropped
out
of
the
text
,
or
perhaps
was
*NL*
subauditum
;
that
is
,
present
in
the
king
's
mind
,
but
not
uttered
,
''
said
*NL*
Mr.
Casaubon
,
smiling
and
bending
his
head
towards
Celia
,
who
*NL*
immediately
dropped
backward
a
little
,
because
she
could
not
bear
Mr.
*NL*
Casaubon
to
blink
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
sank
into
silence
on
the
way
back
to
the
house
.
She
felt
some
*NL*
disappointment
,
of
which
she
was
yet
ashamed
,
that
there
was
nothing
*NL*
for
her
to
do
in
Lowick
;
and
in
the
next
few
minutes
her
mind
had
*NL*
glanced
over
the
possibility
,
which
she
would
have
preferred
,
of
*NL*
finding
that
her
home
would
be
in
a
parish
which
had
a
larger
share
of
*NL*
the
world
's
misery
,
so
that
she
might
have
had
more
active
duties
in
*NL*
it
.
Then
,
recurring
to
the
future
actually
before
her
,
she
made
a
*NL*
picture
of
more
complete
devotion
to
Mr.
Casaubon
's
aims
in
which
she
*NL*
would
await
new
duties
.
Many
such
might
reveal
themselves
to
the
*NL*
higher
knowledge
gained
by
her
in
that
companionship
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Tucker
soon
left
them
,
having
some
clerical
work
which
would
not
*NL*
allow
him
to
lunch
at
the
Hall
;
and
as
they
were
re-entering
the
garden
*NL*
through
the
little
gate
,
Mr.
Casaubon
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
seem
a
little
sad
,
Dorothea
.
I
trust
you
are
pleased
with
what
*NL*
you
have
seen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
feeling
something
which
is
perhaps
foolish
and
wrong
,
''
answered
*NL*
Dorothea
,
with
her
usual
openness
--
``
almost
wishing
that
the
people
*NL*
wanted
more
to
be
done
for
them
here
.
I
have
known
so
few
ways
of
*NL*
making
my
life
good
for
anything
.
Of
course
,
my
notions
of
usefulness
*NL*
must
be
narrow
.
I
must
learn
new
ways
of
helping
people
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Doubtless
,
''
said
Mr.
Casaubon
.
``
Each
position
has
its
corresponding
*NL*
duties
.
Yours
,
I
trust
,
as
the
mistress
of
Lowick
,
will
not
leave
any
*NL*
yearning
unfulfilled
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
I
believe
that
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
earnestly
.
``
Do
not
suppose
*NL*
that
I
am
sad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
well
.
But
,
if
you
are
not
tired
,
we
will
take
another
way
to
*NL*
the
house
than
that
by
which
we
came
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
was
not
at
all
tired
,
and
a
little
circuit
was
made
towards
a
*NL*
fine
yew-tree
,
the
chief
hereditary
glory
of
the
grounds
on
this
side
*NL*
of
the
house
.
As
they
approached
it
,
a
figure
,
conspicuous
on
a
dark
*NL*
background
of
evergreens
,
was
seated
on
a
bench
,
sketching
the
old
*NL*
tree
.
Mr.
Brooke
,
who
was
walking
in
front
with
Celia
,
turned
his
*NL*
head
,
and
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
that
youngster
,
Casaubon
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
come
very
near
when
Mr.
Casaubon
answered
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
a
young
relative
of
mine
,
a
second
cousin
:
the
grandson
,
in
*NL*
fact
,
''
he
added
,
looking
at
Dorothea
,
``
of
the
lady
whose
portrait
you
*NL*
have
been
noticing
,
my
aunt
Julia
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
had
laid
down
his
sketch-book
and
risen
.
His
bushy
*NL*
light-brown
curls
,
as
well
as
his
youthfulness
,
identified
him
at
once
*NL*
with
Celia
's
apparition
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dorothea
,
let
me
introduce
to
you
my
cousin
,
Mr.
Ladislaw
.
Will
,
this
*NL*
is
Miss
Brooke
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
cousin
was
so
close
now
,
that
,
when
he
lifted
his
hat
,
Dorothea
*NL*
could
see
a
pair
of
gray
eyes
rather
near
together
,
a
delicate
*NL*
irregular
nose
with
a
little
ripple
in
it
,
and
hair
falling
backward
;
*NL*
but
there
was
a
mouth
and
chin
of
a
more
prominent
,
threatening
aspect
*NL*
than
belonged
to
the
type
of
the
grandmother
's
miniature
.
Young
*NL*
Ladislaw
did
not
feel
it
necessary
to
smile
,
as
if
he
were
charmed
with
*NL*
this
introduction
to
his
future
second
cousin
and
her
relatives
;
but
*NL*
wore
rather
a
pouting
air
of
discontent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
an
artist
,
I
see
,
''
said
Mr.
Brooke
,
taking
up
the
sketch-book
*NL*
and
turning
it
over
in
his
unceremonious
fashion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
only
sketch
a
little
.
There
is
nothing
fit
to
be
seen
there
,
''
*NL*
said
young
Ladislaw
,
coloring
,
perhaps
with
temper
rather
than
modesty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
come
,
this
is
a
nice
bit
,
now
.
I
did
a
little
in
this
way
myself
*NL*
at
one
time
,
you
know
.
Look
here
,
now
;
this
is
what
I
call
a
nice
*NL*
thing
,
done
with
what
we
used
to
call
_
brio
_
.
''
Mr.
Brooke
held
out
*NL*
towards
the
two
girls
a
large
colored
sketch
of
stony
ground
and
trees
,
*NL*
with
a
pool
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
no
judge
of
these
things
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
not
coldly
,
but
with
an
*NL*
eager
deprecation
of
the
appeal
to
her
.
``
You
know
,
uncle
,
I
never
see
*NL*
the
beauty
of
those
pictures
which
you
say
are
so
much
praised
.
They
*NL*
are
a
language
I
do
not
understand
.
I
suppose
there
is
some
relation
*NL*
between
pictures
and
nature
which
I
am
too
ignorant
to
feel
--
just
as
*NL*
you
see
what
a
Greek
sentence
stands
for
which
means
nothing
to
me
.
''
*NL*
Dorothea
looked
up
at
Mr.
Casaubon
,
who
bowed
his
head
towards
her
,
*NL*
while
Mr.
Brooke
said
,
smiling
nonchalantly
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bless
me
,
now
,
how
different
people
are
!
But
you
had
a
bad
style
of
*NL*
teaching
,
you
know
--
else
this
is
just
the
thing
for
girls
--
sketching
,
*NL*
fine
art
and
so
on
.
But
you
took
to
drawing
plans
;
you
do
n't
*NL*
understand
morbidezza
,
and
that
kind
of
thing
.
You
will
come
to
my
*NL*
house
,
I
hope
,
and
I
will
show
you
what
I
did
in
this
way
,
''
he
*NL*
continued
,
turning
to
young
Ladislaw
,
who
had
to
be
recalled
from
his
*NL*
preoccupation
in
observing
Dorothea
.
Ladislaw
had
made
up
his
mind
*NL*
that
she
must
be
an
unpleasant
girl
,
since
she
was
going
to
marry
*NL*
Casaubon
,
and
what
she
said
of
her
stupidity
about
pictures
would
have
*NL*
confirmed
that
opinion
even
if
he
had
believed
her
.
As
it
was
,
he
took
*NL*
her
words
for
a
covert
judgment
,
and
was
certain
that
she
thought
his
*NL*
sketch
detestable
.
There
was
too
much
cleverness
in
her
apology
:
she
*NL*
was
laughing
both
at
her
uncle
and
himself
.
But
what
a
voice
!
It
was
*NL*
like
the
voice
of
a
soul
that
had
once
lived
in
an
Aeolian
harp
.
This
*NL*
must
be
one
of
Nature
's
inconsistencies
.
There
could
be
no
sort
of
*NL*
passion
in
a
girl
who
would
marry
Casaubon
.
But
he
turned
from
her
,
*NL*
and
bowed
his
thanks
for
Mr.
Brooke
's
invitation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
will
turn
over
my
Italian
engravings
together
,
''
continued
that
*NL*
good-natured
man
.
``
I
have
no
end
of
those
things
,
that
I
have
laid
by
*NL*
for
years
.
One
gets
rusty
in
this
part
of
the
country
,
you
know
.
Not
*NL*
you
,
Casaubon
;
you
stick
to
your
studies
;
but
my
best
ideas
get
*NL*
undermost
--
out
of
use
,
you
know
.
You
clever
young
men
must
guard
*NL*
against
indolence
.
I
was
too
indolent
,
you
know
:
else
I
might
have
*NL*
been
anywhere
at
one
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
a
seasonable
admonition
,
''
said
Mr.
Casaubon
;
``
but
now
we
will
*NL*
pass
on
to
the
house
,
lest
the
young
ladies
should
be
tired
of
*NL*
standing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
their
backs
were
turned
,
young
Ladislaw
sat
down
to
go
on
with
his
*NL*
sketching
,
and
as
he
did
so
his
face
broke
into
an
expression
of
*NL*
amusement
which
increased
as
he
went
on
drawing
,
till
at
last
he
threw
*NL*
back
his
head
and
laughed
aloud
.
Partly
it
was
the
reception
of
his
*NL*
own
artistic
production
that
tickled
him
;
partly
the
notion
of
his
*NL*
grave
cousin
as
the
lover
of
that
girl
;
and
partly
Mr.
Brooke
's
*NL*
definition
of
the
place
he
might
have
held
but
for
the
impediment
of
*NL*
indolence
.
Mr.
Will
Ladislaw
's
sense
of
the
ludicrous
lit
up
his
*NL*
features
very
agreeably
:
it
was
the
pure
enjoyment
of
comicality
,
and
*NL*
had
no
mixture
of
sneering
and
self-exaltation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
your
nephew
going
to
do
with
himself
,
Casaubon
?
''
said
Mr.
*NL*
Brooke
,
as
they
went
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
cousin
,
you
mean
--
not
my
nephew
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
cousin
.
But
in
the
way
of
a
career
,
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
answer
to
that
question
is
painfully
doubtful
.
On
leaving
Rugby
*NL*
he
declined
to
go
to
an
English
university
,
where
I
would
gladly
have
*NL*
placed
him
,
and
chose
what
I
must
consider
the
anomalous
course
of
*NL*
studying
at
Heidelberg
.
And
now
he
wants
to
go
abroad
again
,
without
*NL*
any
special
object
,
save
the
vague
purpose
of
what
he
calls
culture
,
*NL*
preparation
for
he
knows
not
what
.
He
declines
to
choose
a
profession
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
no
means
but
what
you
furnish
,
I
suppose
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
always
given
him
and
his
friends
reason
to
understand
that
I
*NL*
would
furnish
in
moderation
what
was
necessary
for
providing
him
with
a
*NL*
scholarly
education
,
and
launching
him
respectably
.
I
am-therefore
*NL*
bound
to
fulfil
the
expectation
so
raised
,
''
said
Mr.
Casaubon
,
putting
*NL*
his
conduct
in
the
light
of
mere
rectitude
:
a
trait
of
delicacy
which
*NL*
Dorothea
noticed
with
admiration
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
a
thirst
for
travelling
;
perhaps
he
may
turn
out
a
Bruce
or
a
*NL*
Mungo
Park
,
''
said
Mr.
Brooke
.
``
I
had
a
notion
of
that
myself
at
one
*NL*
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
he
has
no
bent
towards
exploration
,
or
the
enlargement
of
our
*NL*
geognosis
:
that
would
be
a
special
purpose
which
I
could
recognize
with
*NL*
some
approbation
,
though
without
felicitating
him
on
a
career
which
so
*NL*
often
ends
in
premature
and
violent
death
.
But
so
far
is
he
from
*NL*
having
any
desire
for
a
more
accurate
knowledge
of
the
earth
's
surface
,
*NL*
that
he
said
he
should
prefer
not
to
know
the
sources
of
the
Nile
,
and
*NL*
that
there
should
be
some
unknown
regions
preserved
as
hunting
grounds
*NL*
for
the
poetic
imagination
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
there
is
something
in
that
,
you
know
,
''
said
Mr.
Brooke
,
who
had
*NL*
certainly
an
impartial
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
,
I
fear
,
nothing
more
than
a
part
of
his
general
inaccuracy
and
*NL*
indisposition
to
thoroughness
of
all
kinds
,
which
would
be
a
bad
augury
*NL*
for
him
in
any
profession
,
civil
or
sacred
,
even
were
he
so
far
*NL*
submissive
to
ordinary
rule
as
to
choose
one

*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
he
has
conscientious
scruples
founded
on
his
own
unfitness

''
*NL*
said
Dorothea
,
who
was
interesting
herself
in
finding
a
favorable
*NL*
explanation
.
``
Because
the
law
and
medicine
should
be
very
serious

professions
to
undertake

not

lives

depend
on
them

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Doubtless
;
but
I
fear
that
my
young
relative
Will
Ladislaw
is
chiefly
*NL*
determined
in
his
aversion

callings
by
a
dislike
to
steady

instrumentally

is
not
charming
or
immediately
inviting

self-indulgent
taste

I
have
insisted
to
him
on
what
Aristotle
has
*NL*
stated
with
admirable
brevity
,
that
for
the
achievement
of
any
work
*NL*
regarded
as
an
end
there
must
be
a
prior
exercise
of
many
energies
or
*NL*
acquired
facilities
of
a
secondary
order
,
demanding
patience
.
I
have
*NL*
pointed
to
my
own
manuscript
volumes
,
which
represent
the
toil
of
years
*NL*
preparatory
to
a
work
not
yet
accomplished
.
But
in
vain
.
To
careful
*NL*
reasoning
of
this
kind
he
replies
by
calling
himself
Pegasus
,
and
every
*NL*
form
of
prescribed
work

harness

*NL*
Celia
laughed
.
She
was
surprised
to
find
that
Mr.
Casaubon
could
say
*NL*
something
quite
amusing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
know
,
he
may
turn
out
a
Byron
,
a
Chatterton
,
a
*NL*
Churchill
--
that
sort
of
thing
--
there
's
no
telling
,
''
said
Mr.
Brooke
.
*NL*
``
Shall
you
let
him
go
to
Italy
,
or
wherever
else
he
wants
to
go
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
I
have
agreed
to
furnish
him
with
moderate
supplies
for
a
year
or
*NL*
so
;
he
asks
no
more
.
I
shall
let
him
be
tried
by
the
test
of
freedom
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
very
kind
of
you
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
looking
up
at
Mr.
Casaubon
*NL*
with
delight
.
``
It
is
noble
.
After
all
,
people
may
really
have
in
them
*NL*
some
vocation
which
is
not
quite
plain
to
themselves
,
may
they
not
?
*NL*
They
may
seem
idle
and
weak
because
they
are
growing
.
We
should
be
*NL*
very
patient
with
each
other
,
I
think
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
it
is
being
engaged
to
be
married

has
made
you
think
*NL*
patience
good

''
said
Celia
,
as
soon
as
she
and
Dorothea
were
alone
*NL*
together
,
taking
off
their
wrappings
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
mean
that
I
am
very
impatient
,
Celia
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
when
people
do
n't
do
and
say
just
what
you
like

''
Celia
had
*NL*
become
less
afraid
of
``
saying
things
''
to
Dorothea
since
this
*NL*
engagement
:
cleverness
seemed
to
her
more
pitiable
than
ever

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Young
Ladislaw
did
not
pay
that
visit
to
which
Mr.
Brooke
had
invited
*NL*
him
,
and
only
six
days
afterwards
Mr.
Casaubon
mentioned
that
his
young
*NL*
relative
had
started
for
the
Continent
,
seeming
by
this
cold
vagueness
*NL*
to
waive
inquiry
.
Indeed
,
Will
had
declined
to
fix
on
any
more
precise
*NL*
destination
than
the
entire
area
of
Europe
.
Genius
,
he
held
,
is
*NL*
necessarily
intolerant
of
fetters
:
on
the
one
hand
it
must
have
the
*NL*
utmost
play
for
its
spontaneity
;
on
the
other
,
it
may
confidently
await
*NL*
those
messages
from
the
universe
which
summon
it
to
its
peculiar
work
,
*NL*
only
placing
itself
in
an
attitude
of
receptivity
towards
all
sublime
*NL*
chances
.
The
attitudes
of
receptivity
are
various
,
and
Will
had
*NL*
sincerely
tried
many
of
them
.
He
was
not
excessively
fond
of
wine
,
but
*NL*
he
had
several
times
taken
too
much
,
simply
as
an
experiment
in
that
*NL*
form
of
ecstasy
;
he
had
fasted
till
he
was
faint
,
and
then
supped
on
*NL*
lobster
;
he
had
made
himself
ill
with
doses
of
opium
.
Nothing
greatly
*NL*
original
had
resulted
from
these
measures
;
and
the
effects
of
the
opium
*NL*
had
convinced
him
that
there
was
an
entire
dissimilarity
between
his
*NL*
constitution
and
De
Quincey
's
.
The
superadded
circumstance
which
would
*NL*
evolve
the
genius
had
not
yet
come
;
the
universe
had
not
yet
beckoned
.
*NL*
Even
Caesar
's
fortune
at
one
time
was
,
but
a
grand
presentiment
.
We
*NL*
know
what
a
masquerade
all
development
is
,
and
what
effective
shapes
*NL*
may
be
disguised
in
helpless
embryos
.
--
In
fact
,
the
world
is
full
of
*NL*
hopeful
analogies
and
handsome
dubious
eggs
called
possibilities
.
Will
*NL*
saw
clearly
enough
the
pitiable
instances
of
long
incubation
producing
*NL*
no
chick
,
and
but
for
gratitude
would
have
laughed
at
Casaubon
,
whose
*NL*
plodding
application
,
rows
of
note-books
,
and
small
taper
of
learned
*NL*
theory
exploring
the
tossed
ruins
of
the
world
,
seemed
to
enforce
a
*NL*
moral
entirely
encouraging
to
Will
's
generous
reliance
on
the
*NL*
intentions
of
the
universe
with
regard
to
himself
.
He
held
that
*NL*
reliance
to
be
a
mark
of
genius
;
and
certainly
it
is
no
mark
to
the
*NL*
contrary
;
genius
consisting
neither
in
self-conceit
nor
in
humility
,
*NL*
but
in
a
power
to
make
or
do
,
not
anything
in
general
,
but
something
in
*NL*
particular
.
Let
him
start
for
the
Continent
,
then
,
without
our
*NL*
pronouncing
on
his
future
.
Among
all
forms
of
mistake
,
prophecy
is
the
*NL*
most
gratuitous
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
at
present
this
caution
against
a
too
hasty
judgment
interests
me
*NL*
more
in
relation
to
Mr.
Casaubon
than
to
his
young
cousin
.
If
to
*NL*
Dorothea
Mr.
Casaubon
had
been
the
mere
occasion
which
had
set
alight
*NL*
the
fine
inflammable
material
of
her
youthful
illusions
,
does
it
follow
*NL*
that
he
was
fairly
represented
in
the
minds
of
those
less
impassioned
*NL*
personages
who
have
hitherto
delivered
their
judgments
concerning
him
?
*NL*
I
protest
against
any
absolute
conclusion
,
any
prejudice
derived
from
*NL*
Mrs.
Cadwallader
's
contempt
for
a
neighboring
clergyman
's
alleged
*NL*
greatness
of
soul
,
or
Sir
James
Chettam
's
poor
opinion
of
his
rival
's
*NL*
legs
,
--
from
Mr.
Brooke
's
failure
to
elicit
a
companion
's
ideas
,
or
from
*NL*
Celia
's
criticism
of
a
middle-aged
scholar
's
personal
appearance
.
I
am
*NL*
not
sure
that
the
greatest
man
of
his
age
,
if
ever
that
solitary
*NL*
superlative
existed
,
could
escape
these
unfavorable
reflections
of
*NL*
himself
in
various
small
mirrors
;
and
even
Milton
,
looking
for
his
*NL*
portrait
in
a
spoon
,
must
submit
to
have
the
facial
angle
of
a
bumpkin
.
*NL*
Moreover
,
if
Mr.
Casaubon
,
speaking
for
himself
,
has
rather
a
chilling
*NL*
rhetoric
,
it
is
not
therefore
certain
that
there
is
no
good
work
or
*NL*
fine
feeling
in
him
.
Did
not
an
immortal
physicist
and
interpreter
of
*NL*
hieroglyphs
write
detestable
verses
?
Has
the
theory
of
the
solar
*NL*
system
been
advanced
by
graceful
manners
and
conversational
tact
?
*NL*
Suppose
we
turn
from
outside
estimates
of
a
man
,
to
wonder
,
with
keener
*NL*
interest
,
what
is
the
report
of
his
own
consciousness
about
his
doings
*NL*
or
capacity
:
with
what
hindrances
he
is
carrying
on
his
daily
labors
;
*NL*
what
fading
of
hopes
,
or
what
deeper
fixity
of
self-delusion
the
years
*NL*
are
marking
off
within
him
;
and
with
what
spirit
he
wrestles
against
*NL*
universal
pressure
,
which
will
one
day
be
too
heavy
for
him
,
and
bring
*NL*
his
heart
to
its
final
pause
.
Doubtless
his
lot
is
important
in
his
*NL*
own
eyes
;
and
the
chief
reason
that
we
think
he
asks
too
large
a
place
*NL*
in
our
consideration
must
be
our
want
of
room
for
him
,
since
we
refer
*NL*
him
to
the
Divine
regard
with
perfect
confidence
;
nay
,
it
is
even
held
*NL*
sublime
for
our
neighbor
to
expect
the
utmost
there
,
however
little
he
*NL*
may
have
got
from
us
.
Mr.
Casaubon
,
too
,
was
the
centre
of
his
own
*NL*
world
;
if
he
was
liable
to
think
that
others
were
providentially
made
*NL*
for
him
,
and
especially
to
consider
them
in
the
light
of
their
fitness
*NL*
for
the
author
of
a
``
Key
to
all
Mythologies
,
''
this
trait
is
not
quite
*NL*
alien
to
us
,
and
,
like
the
other
mendicant
hopes
of
mortals
,
claims
*NL*
some
of
our
pity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Certainly
this
affair
of
his
marriage
with
Miss
Brooke
touched
him
more
*NL*
nearly
than
it
did
any
one
of
the
persons
who
have
hitherto
shown
their
*NL*
disapproval
of
it
,
and
in
the
present
stage
of
things
I
feel
more
*NL*
tenderly
towards
his
experience
of
success
than
towards
the
*NL*
disappointment
of
the
amiable
Sir
James
.
For
in
truth
,
as
the
day
*NL*
fixed
for
his
marriage
came
nearer
,
Mr.
Casaubon
did
not
find
his
*NL*
spirits
rising
;
nor
did
the
contemplation
of
that
matrimonial
garden
*NL*
scene
,
where
,
as
all
experience
showed
,
the
path
was
to
be
bordered
*NL*
with
flowers
,
prove
persistently
more
enchanting
to
him
than
the
*NL*
accustomed
vaults
where
he
walked
taper
in
hand
.
He
did
not
confess
to
*NL*
himself
,
still
less
could
he
have
breathed
to
another
,
his
surprise
*NL*
that
though
he
had
won
a
lovely
and
noble-hearted
girl
he
had
not
won
*NL*
delight
,
--
which
he
had
also
regarded
as
an
object
to
be
found
by
*NL*
search
.
It
is
true
that
he
knew
all
the
classical
passages
implying
*NL*
the
contrary
;
but
knowing
classical
passages
,
we
find
,
is
a
mode
of
*NL*
motion
,
which
explains
why
they
leave
so
little
extra
force
for
their
*NL*
personal
application
.
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Mr.
Casaubon
had
imagined
that
his
long
studious
bachelorhood
had
*NL*
stored
up
for
him
a
compound
interest
of
enjoyment
,
and
that
large
*NL*
drafts
on
his
affections
would
not
fail
to
be
honored
;
for
we
all
of
*NL*
us
,
grave
or
light
,
get
our
thoughts
entangled
in
metaphors
,
and
act
*NL*
fatally
on
the
strength
of
them
.
And
now
he
was
in
danger
of
being
*NL*
saddened
by
the
very
conviction
that
his
circumstances
were
unusually
*NL*
happy
:
there
was
nothing
external
by
which
he
could
account
for
a
*NL*
certain
blankness
of
sensibility
which
came
over
him
just
when
his
*NL*
expectant
gladness
should
have
been
most
lively
,
just
when
he
exchanged
*NL*
the
accustomed
dulness
of
his
Lowick
library
for
his
visits
to
the
*NL*
Grange
.
Here
was
a
weary
experience
in
which
he
was
as
utterly
*NL*
condemned
to
loneliness
as
in
the
despair
which
sometimes
threatened
*NL*
him
while
toiling
in
the
morass
of
authorship
without
seeming
nearer
to
*NL*
the
goal
.
And
his
was
that
worst
loneliness
which
would
shrink
from
*NL*
sympathy
.
He
could
not
but
wish
that
Dorothea
should
think
him
not
*NL*
less
happy
than
the
world
would
expect
her
successful
suitor
to
be
;
and
*NL*
in
relation
to
his
authorship
he
leaned
on
her
young
trust
and
*NL*
veneration
,
he
liked
to
draw
forth
her
fresh
interest
in
listening
,
as
*NL*
a
means
of
encouragement
to
himself
:
in
talking
to
her
he
presented
all
*NL*
his
performance
and
intention
with
the
reflected
confidence
of
the
*NL*
pedagogue
,
and
rid
himself
for
the
time
of
that
chilling
ideal
audience
*NL*
which
crowded
his
laborious
uncreative
hours
with
the
vaporous
pressure
*NL*
of
Tartarean
shades
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
to
Dorothea
,
after
that
toy-box
history
of
the
world
adapted
to
*NL*
young
ladies
which
had
made
the
chief
part
of
her
education
,
Mr.
*NL*
Casaubon
's
talk
about
his
great
book
was
full
of
new
vistas
;
and
this
*NL*
sense
of
revelation
,
this
surprise
of
a
nearer
introduction
to
Stoics
*NL*
and
Alexandrians
,
as
people
who
had
ideas
not
totally
unlike
her
own
,
*NL*
kept
in
abeyance
for
the
time
her
usual
eagerness
for
a
binding
theory
*NL*
which
could
bring
her
own
life
and
doctrine
into
strict
connection
with
*NL*
that
amazing
past
,
and
give
the
remotest
sources
of
knowledge
some
*NL*
bearing
on
her
actions
.
That
more
complete
teaching
would
come
--
Mr.
*NL*
Casaubon
would
tell
her
all
that
:
she
was
looking
forward
to
higher
*NL*
initiation
in
ideas
,
as
she
was
looking
forward
to
marriage
,
and
*NL*
blending
her
dim
conceptions
of
both
.
It
would
be
a
great
mistake
to
*NL*
suppose
that
Dorothea
would
have
cared
about
any
share
in
Mr.
*NL*
Casaubon
's
learning
as
mere
accomplishment
;
for
though
opinion
in
the
*NL*
neighborhood
of
Freshitt
and
Tipton
had
pronounced
her
clever
,
that
*NL*
epithet
would
not
have
described
her
to
circles
in
whose
more
precise
*NL*
vocabulary
cleverness
implies
mere
aptitude
for
knowing
and
doing
,
*NL*
apart
from
character
.
All
her
eagerness
for
acquirement
lay
within
*NL*
that
full
current
of
sympathetic
motive
in
which
her
ideas
and
impulses
*NL*
were
habitually
swept
along
.
She
did
not
want
to
deck
herself
with
*NL*
knowledge
--
to
wear
it
loose
from
the
nerves
and
blood
that
fed
her
*NL*
action
;
and
if
she
had
written
a
book
she
must
have
done
it
as
Saint
*NL*
Theresa
did
,
under
the
command
of
an
authority
that
constrained
her
*NL*
conscience
.
But
something
she
yearned
for
by
which
her
life
might
be
*NL*
filled
with
action
at
once
rational
and
ardent
;
and
since
the
time
was
*NL*
gone
by
for
guiding
visions
and
spiritual
directors
,
since
prayer
*NL*
heightened
yearning
but
not
instruction
,
what
lamp
was
there
but
*NL*
knowledge
?
Surely
learned
men
kept
the
only
oil
;
and
who
more
learned
*NL*
than
Mr.
Casaubon
?
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
in
these
brief
weeks
Dorothea
's
joyous
grateful
expectation
was
*NL*
unbroken
,
and
however
her
lover
might
occasionally
be
conscious
of
*NL*
flatness
,
he
could
never
refer
it
to
any
slackening
of
her
affectionate
*NL*
interest
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
season
was
mild
enough
to
encourage
the
project
of
extending
the
*NL*
wedding
journey
as
far
as
Rome
,
and
Mr.
Casaubon
was
anxious
for
this
*NL*
because
he
wished
to
inspect
some
manuscripts
in
the
Vatican
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
still
regret
that
your
sister
is
not
to
accompany
us
,
''
he
said
one
*NL*
morning
,
some
time
after
it
had
been
ascertained
that
Celia
objected
to
*NL*
go
,
and
that
Dorothea
did
not
wish
for
her
companionship
.
``
You
will
*NL*
have
many
lonely
hours
,
Dorothea
,
for
I
shall
be
constrained
to
make
*NL*
the
utmost
use
of
my
time
during
our
stay
in
Rome
,
and
I
should
feel
*NL*
more
at
liberty
if
you
had
a
companion
.

*NL*
*NL*
The
words
``
I
should
feel
more
at
liberty
''
grated
on
Dorothea
.
For
the
*NL*
first
time
in
speaking
to
Mr.
Casaubon
she
colored
from
annoyance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
have
misunderstood
me
very
much
,
''
she
said
,
``
if
you
think
I
*NL*
should
not
enter
into
the
value
of
your
time
--
if
you
think
that
I
*NL*
should
not
willingly
give
up
whatever
interfered
with
your
using
it
to
*NL*
the
best
purpose
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
very
amiable
in
you
,
my
dear
Dorothea
,
''
said
Mr.
Casaubon
,
not
*NL*
in
the
least
noticing
that
she
was
hurt
;
``
but
if
you
had
a
lady
as
your
*NL*
companion
,
I
could
put
you
both
under
the
care
of
a
cicerone
,
and
we
*NL*
could
thus
achieve
two
purposes
in
the
same
space
of
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beg
you
will
not
refer
to
this
again
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
rather
*NL*
haughtily
.
But
immediately
she
feared
that
she
was
wrong
,
and
turning
*NL*
towards
him
she
laid
her
hand
on
his
,
adding
in
a
different
tone
,
``
Pray
*NL*
do
not
be
anxious
about
me
.
I
shall
have
so
much
to
think
of
when
I
am
*NL*
alone
.
And
Tantripp
will
be
a
sufficient
companion
,
just
to
take
care
*NL*
of
me
.
I
could
not
bear
to
have
Celia
:
she
would
be
miserable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
time
to
dress
.
There
was
to
be
a
dinner-party
that
day
,
the
*NL*
last
of
the
parties
which
were
held
at
the
Grange
as
proper
*NL*
preliminaries
to
the
wedding
,
and
Dorothea
was
glad
of
a
reason
for
*NL*
moving
away
at
once
on
the
sound
of
the
bell
,
as
if
she
needed
more
*NL*
than
her
usual
amount
of
preparation
.
She
was
ashamed
of
being
*NL*
irritated
from
some
cause
she
could
not
define
even
to
herself
;
for
*NL*
though
she
had
no
intention
to
be
untruthful
,
her
reply
had
not
touched
*NL*
the
real
hurt
within
her
.
Mr.
Casaubon
's
words
had
been
quite
*NL*
reasonable
,
yet
they
had
brought
a
vague
instantaneous
sense
of
*NL*
aloofness
on
his
part
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Surely
I
am
in
a
strangely
selfish
weak
state
of
mind
,
''
she
said
to
*NL*
herself
.
``
How
can
I
have
a
husband
who
is
so
much
above
me
without
*NL*
knowing
that
he
needs
me
less
than
I
need
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Having
convinced
herself
that
Mr.
Casaubon
was
altogether
right
,
she
*NL*
recovered
her
equanimity
,
and
was
an
agreeable
image
of
serene
dignity
*NL*
when
she
came
into
the
drawing-room
in
her
silver-gray
dress
--
the
*NL*
simple
lines
of
her
dark-brown
hair
parted
over
her
brow
and
coiled
*NL*
massively
behind
,
in
keeping
with
the
entire
absence
from
her
manner
*NL*
and
expression
of
all
search
after
mere
effect
.
Sometimes
when
*NL*
Dorothea
was
in
company
,
there
seemed
to
be
as
complete
an
air
of
*NL*
repose
about
her
as
if
she
had
been
a
picture
of
Santa
Barbara
looking
*NL*
out
from
her
tower
into
the
clear
air
;
but
these
intervals
of
quietude
*NL*
made
the
energy
of
her
speech
and
emotion
the
more
remarked
when
some
*NL*
outward
appeal
had
touched
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
naturally
the
subject
of
many
observations
this
evening
,
for
*NL*
the
dinner-party
was
large
and
rather
more
miscellaneous
as
to
the
male
*NL*
portion
than
any
which
had
been
held
at
the
Grange
since
Mr.
Brooke
's
*NL*
nieces
had
resided
with
him
,
so
that
the
talking
was
done
in
duos
and
*NL*
trios
more
or
less
inharmonious
.
There
was
the
newly
elected
mayor
of
*NL*
Middlemarch
,
who
happened
to
be
a
manufacturer
;
the
philanthropic
*NL*
banker
his
brother-in-law
,
who
predominated
so
much
in
the
town
that
*NL*
some
called
him
a
Methodist
,
others
a
hypocrite
,
according
to
the
*NL*
resources
of
their
vocabulary
;
and
there
were
various
professional
men
.
*NL*
In
fact
,
Mrs.
Cadwallader
said
that
Brooke
was
beginning
to
treat
the
*NL*
Middlemarchers
,
and
that
she
preferred
the
farmers
at
the
tithe-dinner
,
*NL*
who
drank
her
health
unpretentiously
,
and
were
not
ashamed
of
their
*NL*
grandfathers
'
furniture
.
For
in
that
part
of
the
country
,
before
*NL*
reform
had
done
its
notable
part
in
developing
the
political
*NL*
consciousness
,
there
was
a
clearer
distinction
of
ranks
and
a
dimmer
*NL*
distinction
of
parties
;
so
that
Mr.
Brooke
's
miscellaneous
invitations
*NL*
seemed
to
belong
to
that
general
laxity
which
came
from
his
inordinate
*NL*
travel
and
habit
of
taking
too
much
in
the
form
of
ideas
.
*NL*
*NL*
Already
,
as
Miss
Brooke
passed
out
of
the
dining-room
,
opportunity
was
*NL*
found
for
some
interjectional
``
asides
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
fine
woman
,
Miss
Brooke
!
an
uncommonly
fine
woman
,
by
God
!
''
said
Mr.
*NL*
Standish
,
the
old
lawyer
,
who
had
been
so
long
concerned
with
the
*NL*
landed
gentry
that
he
had
become
landed
himself
,
and
used
that
oath
in
*NL*
a
deep-mouthed
manner
as
a
sort
of
armorial
bearings
,
stamping
the
*NL*
speech
of
a
man
who
held
a
good
position
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bulstrode
,
the
banker
,
seemed
to
be
addressed
,
but
that
gentleman
*NL*
disliked
coarseness
and
profanity
,
and
merely
bowed
.
The
remark
was
*NL*
taken
up
by
Mr.
Chichely
,
a
middle-aged
bachelor
and
coursing
*NL*
celebrity
,
who
had
a
complexion
something
like
an
Easter
egg
,
a
few
*NL*
hairs
carefully
arranged
,
and
a
carriage
implying
the
consciousness
of
*NL*
a
distinguished
appearance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
not
my
style
of
woman
:
I
like
a
woman
who
lays
herself
out
a
*NL*
little
more
to
please
us
.
There
should
be
a
little
filigree
about
a
*NL*
woman
--
something
of
the
coquette
.
A
man
likes
a
sort
of
challenge
.
*NL*
The
more
of
a
dead
set
she
makes
at
you
the
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
some
truth
in
that
,
''
said
Mr.
Standish
,
disposed
to
be
genial
.
*NL*
``
And
,
by
God
,
it
's
usually
the
way
with
them
.
I
suppose
it
answers
*NL*
some
wise
ends
:
Providence
made
them
so
,
eh
,
Bulstrode
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
be
disposed
to
refer
coquetry
to
another
source
,
''
said
Mr.
*NL*
Bulstrode
.
``
I
should
rather
refer
it
to
the
devil
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
to
be
sure
,
there
should
be
a
little
devil
in
a
woman
,
''
said
Mr.
*NL*
Chichely
,
whose
study
of
the
fair
sex
seemed
to
have
been
detrimental
*NL*
to
his
theology
.
``
And
I
like
them
blond
,
with
a
certain
gait
,
and
a
*NL*
swan
neck
.
Between
ourselves
,
the
mayor
's
daughter
is
more
to
my
taste
*NL*
than
Miss
Brooke
or
Miss
Celia
either
.
If
I
were
a
marrying
man
I
*NL*
should
choose
Miss
Vincy
before
either
of
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
make
up
,
make
up
,
''
said
Mr.
Standish
,
jocosely
;
``
you
see
the
*NL*
middle-aged
fellows
early
the
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Chichely
shook
his
head
with
much
meaning
:
he
was
not
going
to
*NL*
incur
the
certainty
of
being
accepted
by
the
woman
he
would
choose
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Miss
Vincy
who
had
the
honor
of
being
Mr.
Chichely
's
ideal
was
of
*NL*
course
not
present
;
for
Mr.
Brooke
,
always
objecting
to
go
too
far
,
*NL*
would
not
have
chosen
that
his
nieces
should
meet
the
daughter
of
a
*NL*
Middlemarch
manufacturer
,
unless
it
were
on
a
public
occasion
.
The
*NL*
feminine
part
of
the
company
included
none
whom
Lady
Chettam
or
Mrs.
*NL*
Cadwallader
could
object
to
;
for
Mrs.
Renfrew
,
the
colonel
's
widow
,
was
*NL*
not
only
unexceptionable
in
point
of
breeding
,
but
also
interesting
on
*NL*
the
ground
of
her
complaint
,
which
puzzled
the
doctors
,
and
seemed
*NL*
clearly
a
case
wherein
the
fulness
of
professional
knowledge
might
need
*NL*
the
supplement
of
quackery
.
Lady
Chettam
,
who
attributed
her
own
*NL*
remarkable
health
to
home-made
bitters
united
with
constant
medical
*NL*
attendance
,
entered
with
much
exercise
of
the
imagination
into
Mrs.
*NL*
Renfrew
's
account
of
symptoms
,
and
into
the
amazing
futility
in
her
*NL*
case
of
all
strengthening
medicines
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
can
all
the
strength
of
those
medicines
go
,
my
dear
?
''
said
the
*NL*
mild
but
stately
dowager
,
turning
to
Mrs.
Cadwallader
reflectively
,
*NL*
when
Mrs.
Renfrew
's
attention
was
called
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
strengthens
the
disease
,
''
said
the
Rector
's
wife
,
much
too
*NL*
well-born
not
to
be
an
amateur
in
medicine
.
``
Everything
depends
on
the
*NL*
constitution
:
some
people
make
fat
,
some
blood
,
and
some
bile
--
that
's
*NL*
my
view
of
the
matter
;
and
whatever
they
take
is
a
sort
of
grist
to
the
*NL*
mill
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
she
ought
to
take
medicines
that
would
reduce

reduce
the
*NL*
disease
,
you
know
,
if
you
are
right
,
my
dear

And
I
think
what
you
say
*NL*
is
reasonable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
it
is
reasonable
.
You
have
two
sorts
of
potatoes
,
fed
on
*NL*
the
same
soil

One
of
them
grows
more
and
more
watery

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

this
poor
Mrs.
Renfrew

that
is
what
I
think

Dropsy
!
There
*NL*
is
no
swelling
yet
--
it
is
inward
.
I
should
say
she
ought
to
take
*NL*
drying
medicines
,
should
n't
you
?
--
or
a
dry
hot-air
bath
.
Many
things
*NL*
might
be
tried

of
a
drying
nature

*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
her
try
a
certain
person
's
pamphlets

said
Mrs.
Cadwallader
in
an
*NL*
undertone
,
seeing
the
gentlemen
enter
.
``
He
does
not
want
drying

*NL*
*NL*
``
Who

my
dear

''
said
Lady
Chettam
,
a
charming
woman
,
not
so
quick
as
to
*NL*
nullify
the
pleasure
of
explanation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
bridegroom

Casaubon

He
has
certainly
been
drying
up
faster

the
engagement

the
flame

passion

I
suppose

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
think
he
is
far
from
having

said
Lady

Chettam
,
with
a
still
deeper
undertone

``
And
then
his
studies

so
very
*NL*
dry

you
say

*NL*
*NL*
``
Really

by
the
side
of
Sir
James

he
looks

the
occasion

Mark
my
words

in
a
year
from
this
time
that

girl
will
hate

She
looks
up

be
at

*NL*
``
There

not

anything
worse

said
Lady

with

so
vivid
a
conception
of
the
physic
that
she
seemed
to
have
learned
*NL*
something
exact
about
Mr.

's
disadvantages
.
``
However

*NL*
*NL*
``
That

make-believe

she
appreciates
him

I
hope

little

Certainly

not

But
we
were
talking
of
physic

Tell
me
about
*NL*
this
new
young
surgeon
,
Mr.
Lydgate

I
am
told
he
is
wonderfully

clever

he

looks
it

a
fine
brow
indeed

``
Yes

Mr.

says
he
is
one
of
the
Lydgates

Northumberland

really
well
connected

One
does
not
expect
it
in
a
practitioner

that
kind

For
my
own

I
like
a
medical
man
more
on
a
footing

they
are

I
assure
you
I

found
poor
Hicks

judgment
unfailing
;
I
never
knew
him

He
was
*NL*
coarse
and
butcher-like

he
knew
my
constitution

It
was
a
loss
to
*NL*
me
his
going
off
so
suddenly
.
Dear
me
,
what
a
very
animated
*NL*
conversation
Miss
Brooke
seems
to
be
having
with
this
Mr.
Lydgate
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
talking
cottages
and
hospitals
with
him
,
''
said
Mrs.
*NL*
Cadwallader
,
whose
ears
and
power
of
interpretation
were
quick
.
``
I
*NL*
believe
he
is
a
sort
of
philanthropist
,
so
Brooke
is
sure
to
take
him
*NL*
up

''
*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
The
affable
dowager
declared
herself
delighted
with
this
opportunity
of
*NL*
making
Mr.
Lydgate
's
acquaintance
,
having
heard
of
his
success
in
*NL*
treating
fever
on
a
new
plan
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Lydgate
had
the
medical
accomplishment
of
looking
perfectly
grave
*NL*
whatever
nonsense
was
talked
to
him
,
and
his
dark
steady
eyes
gave
him
*NL*
impressiveness
as
a
listener
.
He
was
as
little
as
possible
like
the
*NL*
lamented
Hicks
,
especially
in
a
certain
careless
refinement
about
his
*NL*
toilet
and
utterance
.
Yet
Lady
Chettam
gathered
much
confidence
in
*NL*
him
.
He
confirmed
her
view
of
her
own
constitution
as
being
peculiar
,
*NL*
by
admitting
that
all
constitutions
might
be
called
peculiar
,
and
he
*NL*
did
not
deny
that
hers
might
be
more
peculiar
than
others
.
He
did
not
*NL*
approve
of
a
too
lowering
system
,
including
reckless
cupping
,
nor
,
on
*NL*
the
other
hand
,
of
incessant
port
wine
and
bark
.
He
said
``
I
think
so
''
*NL*
with
an
air
of
so
much
deference
accompanying
the
insight
of
agreement
,
*NL*
that
she
formed
the
most
cordial
opinion
of
his
talents
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
quite
pleased
with
your
protege
,
''
she
said
to
Mr.
Brooke
before
*NL*
going
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
protege
?
--
dear
me
!
--
who
is
that
?
''
said
Mr.
Brooke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
young
Lydgate
,
the
new
doctor
.
He
seems
to
me
to
understand
his
*NL*
profession
admirably
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Lydgate
!
he
is
not
my
protege
,
you
know
;
only
I
knew
an
uncle
of
*NL*
his
who
sent
me
a
letter
about
him
.
However
,
I
think
he
is
likely
to
*NL*
be
first-rate
--
has
studied
in
Paris
,
knew
Broussais
;
has
ideas
,
you
*NL*
know
--
wants
to
raise
the
profession
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lydgate
has
lots
of
ideas
,
quite
new
,
about
ventilation
and
diet
,
that
*NL*
sort
of
thing
,
''
resumed
Mr.
Brooke
,
after
he
had
handed
out
Lady
*NL*
Chettam
,
and
had
returned
to
be
civil
to
a
group
of
Middlemarchers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hang
it
,
do
you
think
that
is
quite
sound
?
--
upsetting
The
old
*NL*
treatment
,
which
has
made
Englishmen
what
they
are
?
''
said
Mr.
Standish
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Medical
knowledge
is
at
a
low
ebb
among
us
,
''
said
Mr.
Bulstrode
,
who
*NL*
spoke
in
a
subdued
tone
,
and
had
rather
a
sickly
air
.
``
I
,
for
my
part
,
*NL*
hail
the
advent
of
Mr.
Lydgate
.
I
hope
to
find
good
reason
for
*NL*
confiding
the
new
hospital
to
his
management
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
all
very
fine
,
''
replied
Mr.
Standish
,
who
was
not
fond
of
Mr.
*NL*
Bulstrode
;
``
if
you
like
him
to
try
experiments
on
your
hospital
*NL*
patients
,
and
kill
a
few
people
for
charity
I
have
no
objection
.
But
I
*NL*
am
not
going
to
hand
money
out
of
my
purse
to
have
experiments
tried
on
*NL*
me
.
I
like
treatment
that
has
been
tested
a
little
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
know
,
Standish
,
every
dose
you
take
is
an
experiment-an
*NL*
experiment
,
you
know
,
''
said
Mr.
Brooke
,
nodding
towards
the
lawyer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
if
you
talk
in
that
sense
!
''
said
Mr.
Standish
,
with
as
much
*NL*
disgust
at
such
non-legal
quibbling
as
a
man
can
well
betray
towards
a
*NL*
valuable
client
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
be
glad
of
any
treatment
that
would
cure
me
without
reducing
*NL*
me
to
a
skeleton
,
like
poor
Grainger
,
''
said
Mr.
Vincy
,
the
mayor
,
a
*NL*
florid
man
,
who
would
have
served
for
a
study
of
flesh
in
striking
*NL*
contrast
with
the
Franciscan
tints
of
Mr.
Bulstrode
.
``
It
's
an
*NL*
uncommonly
dangerous
thing
to
be
left
without
any
padding
against
the
*NL*
shafts
of
disease
,
as
somebody
said
,
--
and
I
think
it
a
very
good
*NL*
expression
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Lydgate
,
of
course
,
was
out
of
hearing
.
He
had
quitted
the
party
*NL*
early
,
and
would
have
thought
it
altogether
tedious
but
for
the
novelty
*NL*
of
certain
introductions
,
especially
the
introduction
to
Miss
Brooke
,
*NL*
whose
youthful
bloom
,
with
her
approaching
marriage
to
that
faded
*NL*
scholar
,
and
her
interest
in
matters
socially
useful
,
gave
her
the
*NL*
piquancy
of
an
unusual
combination
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
a
good
creature
--
that
fine
girl
--
but
a
little
too
earnest
,
''
he
*NL*
thought
.
``
It
is
troublesome
to
talk
to
such
women
.
They
are
always
*NL*
wanting
reasons
,
yet
they
are
too
ignorant
to
understand
the
merits
of
*NL*
any
question
,
and
usually
fall
back
on
their
moral
sense
to
settle
*NL*
things
after
their
own
taste
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Evidently
Miss
Brooke
was
not
Mr.
Lydgate
's
style
of
woman
any
more
*NL*
than
Mr.
Chichely
's
.
Considered
,
indeed
,
in
relation
to
the
latter
,
*NL*
whose
mind
was
matured
,
she
was
altogether
a
mistake
,
and
calculated
to
*NL*
shock
his
trust
in
final
causes
,
including
the
adaptation
of
fine
young
*NL*
women
to
purplefaced
bachelors
.
But
Lydgate
was
less
ripe
,
and
might
*NL*
possibly
have
experience
before
him
which
would
modify
his
opinion
as
*NL*
to
the
most
excellent
things
in
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Brooke
,
however
,
was
not
again
seen
by
either
of
these
gentlemen
*NL*
under
her
maiden
name
.
Not
long
after
that
dinner-party
she
had
become
*NL*
Mrs.
Casaubon
,
and
was
on
her
way
to
Rome

``

such

do

BEN
JONSON
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Lydgate
,
in
fact
,
was
already
conscious
of
being
fascinated
by
a
woman
*NL*
strikingly
different
from
Miss
Brooke
:
he
did
not
in
the
least
suppose
*NL*
that
he
had
lost
his
balance
and
fallen
in
love
,
but
he
had
said
of
*NL*
that
particular
woman
,
``
She
is
grace
itself
;
she
is
perfectly
lovely
*NL*
and
accomplished
.
That
is
what
a
woman
ought
to
be
:
she
ought
to
*NL*
produce
the
effect
of
exquisite
music
.
''
Plain
women
he
regarded
as
he
*NL*
did
the
other
severe
facts
of
life
,
to
be
faced
with
philosophy
and
*NL*
investigated
by
science
.
But
Rosamond
Vincy
seemed
to
have
the
true
*NL*
melodic
charm
;
and
when
a
man
has
seen
the
woman
whom
he
would
have
*NL*
chosen
if
he
had
intended
to
marry
speedily
,
his
remaining
a
bachelor
*NL*
will
usually
depend
on
her
resolution
rather
than
on
his
.
Lydgate
*NL*
believed
that
he
should
not
marry
for
several
years
:
not
marry
until
he
*NL*
had
trodden
out
a
good
clear
path
for
himself
away
from
the
broad
road
*NL*
which
was
quite
ready
made
.
He
had
seen
Miss
Vincy
above
his
horizon
*NL*
almost
as
long
as
it
had
taken
Mr.
Casaubon
to
become
engaged
and
*NL*
married
:
but
this
learned
gentleman
was
possessed
of
a
fortune
;
he
had
*NL*
assembled
his
voluminous
notes
,
and
had
made
that
sort
of
reputation
*NL*
which
precedes
performance
,
--
often
the
larger
part
of
a
man
's
fame
.
He
*NL*
took
a
wife
,
as
we
have
seen
,
to
adorn
the
remaining
quadrant
of
his
*NL*
course
,
and
be
a
little
moon
that
would
cause
hardly
a
calculable
*NL*
perturbation
.
But
Lydgate
was
young
,
poor
,
ambitious
.
He
had
his
*NL*
half-century
before
him
instead
of
behind
him
,
and
he
had
come
to
*NL*
Middlemarch
bent
on
doing
many
things
that
were
not
directly
fitted
to
*NL*
make
his
fortune
or
even
secure
him
a
good
income
.
To
a
man
under
such
*NL*
circumstances
,
taking
a
wife
is
something
more
than
a
question
of
*NL*
adornment
,
however
highly
he
may
rate
this
;
and
Lydgate
was
disposed
to
*NL*
give
it
the
first
place
among
wifely
functions
.
To
his
taste
,
guided
*NL*
by
a
single
conversation
,
here
was
the
point
on
which
Miss
Brooke
would
*NL*
be
found
wanting
,
notwithstanding
her
undeniable
beauty
.
She
did
not
*NL*
look
at
things
from
the
proper
feminine
angle
.
The
society
of
such
*NL*
women
was
about
as
relaxing
as
going
from
your
work
to
teach
the
second
*NL*
form
,
instead
of
reclining
in
a
paradise
with
sweet
laughs
for
*NL*
bird-notes
,
and
blue
eyes
for
a
heaven
.
*NL*
*NL*
Certainly
nothing
at
present
could
seem
much
less
important
to
Lydgate
*NL*
than
the
turn
of
Miss
Brooke
's
mind
,
or
to
Miss
Brooke
than
the
*NL*
qualities
of
the
woman
who
had
attracted
this
young
surgeon
.
But
any
*NL*
one
watching
keenly
the
stealthy
convergence
of
human
lots
,
sees
a
slow
*NL*
preparation
of
effects
from
one
life
on
another
,
which
tells
like
a
*NL*
calculated
irony
on
the
indifference
or
the
frozen
stare
with
which
we
*NL*
look
at
our
unintroduced
neighbor
.
Destiny
stands
by
sarcastic
with
*NL*
our
dramatis
personae
folded
in
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
Old
provincial
society
had
its
share
of
this
subtle
movement
:
had
not
*NL*
only
its
striking
downfalls
,
its
brilliant
young
professional
dandies
*NL*
who
ended
by
living
up
an
entry
with
a
drab
and
six
children
for
their
*NL*
establishment
,
but
also
those
less
marked
vicissitudes
which
are
*NL*
constantly
shifting
the
boundaries
of
social
intercourse
,
and
begetting
*NL*
new
consciousness
of
interdependence
.
Some
slipped
a
little
downward
,
*NL*
some
got
higher
footing
:
people
denied
aspirates
,
gained
wealth
,
and
*NL*
fastidious
gentlemen
stood
for
boroughs
;
some
were
caught
in
political
*NL*
currents
,
some
in
ecclesiastical
,
and
perhaps
found
themselves
*NL*
surprisingly
grouped
in
consequence
;
while
a
few
personages
or
families
*NL*
that
stood
with
rocky
firmness
amid
all
this
fluctuation
,
were
slowly
*NL*
presenting
new
aspects
in
spite
of
solidity
,
and
altering
with
the
*NL*
double
change
of
self
and
beholder
.
Municipal
town
and
rural
parish
*NL*
gradually
made
fresh
threads
of
connection
--
gradually
,
as
the
old
*NL*
stocking
gave
way
to
the
savings-bank
,
and
the
worship
of
the
solar
*NL*
guinea
became
extinct
;
while
squires
and
baronets
,
and
even
lords
who
*NL*
had
once
lived
blamelessly
afar
from
the
civic
mind
,
gathered
the
*NL*
faultiness
of
closer
acquaintanceship
.
Settlers
,
too
,
came
from
*NL*
distant
counties
,
some
with
an
alarming
novelty
of
skill
,
others
with
*NL*
an
offensive
advantage
in
cunning
.
In
fact
,
much
the
same
sort
of
*NL*
movement
and
mixture
went
on
in
old
England
as
we
find
in
older
*NL*
Herodotus
,
who
also
,
in
telling
what
had
been
,
thought
it
well
to
take
*NL*
a
woman
's
lot
for
his
starting-point
;
though
Io
,
as
a
maiden
apparently
*NL*
beguiled
by
attractive
merchandise
,
was
the
reverse
of
Miss
Brooke
,
and
*NL*
in
this
respect
perhaps
bore
more
resemblance
to
Rosamond
Vincy
,
who
*NL*
had
excellent
taste
in
costume
,
with
that
nymph-like
figure
and
pure
*NL*
blindness
which
give
the
largest
range
to
choice
in
the
flow
and
color
*NL*
of
drapery
.
But
these
things
made
only
part
of
her
charm
.
She
was
*NL*
admitted
to
be
the
flower
of
Mrs.
Lemon
's
school
,
the
chief
school
in
*NL*
the
county
,
where
the
teaching
included
all
that
was
demanded
in
the
*NL*
accomplished
female
--
even
to
extras
,
such
as
the
getting
in
and
out
of
*NL*
a
carriage
.
Mrs.
Lemon
herself
had
always
held
up
Miss
Vincy
as
an
*NL*
example
:
no
pupil
,
she
said
,
exceeded
that
young
lady
for
mental
*NL*
acquisition
and
propriety
of
speech
,
while
her
musical
execution
was
*NL*
quite
exceptional
.
We
can
not
help
the
way
in
which
people
speak
of
us
,
*NL*
and
probably
if
Mrs.
Lemon
had
undertaken
to
describe
Juliet
or
Imogen
,
*NL*
these
heroines
would
not
have
seemed
poetical
.
The
first
vision
of
*NL*
Rosamond
would
have
been
enough
with
most
judges
to
dispel
any
*NL*
prejudice
excited
by
Mrs.
Lemon
's
praise
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lydgate
could
not
be
long
in
Middlemarch
without
having
that
agreeable
*NL*
vision
,
or
even
without
making
the
acquaintance
of
the
Vincy
family
;
*NL*
for
though
Mr.
Peacock
,
whose
practice
he
had
paid
something
to
enter
*NL*
on
,
had
not
been
their
doctor
-LRB-
Mrs.
Vincy
not
liking
the
lowering
*NL*
system
adopted
by
him
-RRB-
,
he
had
many
patients
among
their
connections
*NL*
and
acquaintances
.
For
who
of
any
consequence
in
Middlemarch
was
not
*NL*
connected
or
at
least
acquainted
with
the
Vincys
?
They
were
old
*NL*
manufacturers
,
and
had
kept
a
good
house
for
three
generations
,
in
*NL*
which
there
had
naturally
been
much
intermarrying
with
neighbors
more
*NL*
or
less
decidedly
genteel
.
Mr.
Vincy
's
sister
had
made
a
wealthy
match
*NL*
in
accepting
Mr.
Bulstrode
,
who
,
however
,
as
a
man
not
born
in
the
*NL*
town
,
and
altogether
of
dimly
known
origin
,
was
considered
to
have
done
*NL*
well
in
uniting
himself
with
a
real
Middlemarch
family
;
on
the
other
*NL*
hand
,
Mr.
Vincy
had
descended
a
little
,
having
taken
an
innkeeper
's
*NL*
daughter
.
But
on
this
side
too
there
was
a
cheering
sense
of
money
;
*NL*
for
Mrs.
Vincy
's
sister
had
been
second
wife
to
rich
old
Mr.
*NL*
Featherstone
,
and
had
died
childless
years
ago
,
so
that
her
nephews
and
*NL*
nieces
might
be
supposed
to
touch
the
affections
of
the
widower
.
And
*NL*
it
happened
that
Mr.
Bulstrode
and
Mr.
Featherstone
,
two
of
Peacock
's
*NL*
most
important
patients
,
had
,
from
different
causes
,
given
an
*NL*
especially
good
reception
to
his
successor
,
who
had
raised
some
*NL*
partisanship
as
well
as
discussion
.
Mr.
Wrench
,
medical
attendant
to
*NL*
the
Vincy
family
,
very
early
had
grounds
for
thinking
lightly
of
*NL*
Lydgate
's
professional
discretion
,
and
there
was
no
report
about
him
*NL*
which
was
not
retailed
at
the
Vincys
'
,
where
visitors
were
frequent
.
*NL*
Mr.
Vincy
was
more
inclined
to
general
good-fellowship
than
to
taking
*NL*
sides
,
but
there
was
no
need
for
him
to
be
hasty
in
making
any
new
man
*NL*
acquaintance
.
Rosamond
silently
wished
that
her
father
would
invite
*NL*
Mr.
Lydgate
.
She
was
tired
of
the
faces
and
figures
she
had
always
*NL*
been
used
to
--
the
various
irregular
profiles
and
gaits
and
turns
of
*NL*
phrase
distinguishing
those
Middlemarch
young
men
whom
she
had
known
as
*NL*
boys
.
She
had
been
at
school
with
girls
of
higher
position
,
whose
*NL*
brothers
,
she
felt
sure
,
it
would
have
been
possible
for
her
to
be
more
*NL*
interested
in
,
than
in
these
inevitable
Middlemarch
companions
.
But
*NL*
she
would
not
have
chosen
to
mention
her
wish
to
her
father
;
and
he
,
*NL*
for
his
part
,
was
in
no
hurry
on
the
subject
.
An
alderman
about
to
be
*NL*
mayor
must
by-and-by
enlarge
his
dinner-parties
,
but
at
present
there
*NL*
were
plenty
of
guests
at
his
well-spread
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
table
often
remained
covered
with
the
relics
of
the
family
*NL*
breakfast
long
after
Mr.
Vincy
had
gone
with
his
second
son
to
the
*NL*
warehouse
,
and
when
Miss
Morgan
was
already
far
on
in
morning
lessons
*NL*
with
the
younger
girls
in
the
schoolroom
.
It
awaited
the
family
*NL*
laggard
,
who
found
any
sort
of
inconvenience
-LRB-
to
others
-RRB-
less
*NL*
disagreeable
than
getting
up
when
he
was
called
.
This
was
the
case
one
*NL*
morning
of
the
October
in
which
we
have
lately
seen
Mr.
Casaubon
*NL*
visiting
the
Grange
;
and
though
the
room
was
a
little
overheated
with
*NL*
the
fire
,
which
had
sent
the
spaniel
panting
to
a
remote
corner
,
*NL*
Rosamond
,
for
some
reason
,
continued
to
sit
at
her
embroidery
longer
*NL*
than
usual
,
now
and
then
giving
herself
a
little
shake
,
and
laying
her
*NL*
work
on
her
knee
to
contemplate
it
with
an
air
of
hesitating
weariness
.
*NL*
Her
mamma
,
who
had
returned
from
an
excursion
to
the
kitchen
,
sat
on
*NL*
the
other
side
of
the
small
work-table
with
an
air
of
more
entire
*NL*
placidity
,
until
,
the
clock
again
giving
notice
that
it
was
going
to
*NL*
strike
,
she
looked
up
from
the
lace-mending
which
was
occupying
her
*NL*
plump
fingers
and
rang
the
bell
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Knock
at
Mr.
Fred
's
door
again
,
Pritchard
,
and
tell
him
it
has
struck
*NL*
half-past
ten
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
said
without
any
change
in
the
radiant
good-humor
of
Mrs.
*NL*
Vincy
's
face
,
in
which
forty-five
years
had
delved
neither
angles
nor
*NL*
parallels
;
and
pushing
back
her
pink
capstrings
,
she
let
her
work
rest
*NL*
on
her
lap
,
while
she
looked
admiringly
at
her
daughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mamma

said
Rosamond
,
``

down
I

Rosamond

broke
into

two

Fred
drew

said
nothing

*NL*

Rosamond

really
wished

of
all

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

as

was
passing
out

*NL*
*NL*
``
Really

Fred

*NL*

This

led
to
an
adjustment

for
Rosamond
had
set
her
mind
on
*NL*
that
particular
ride

*NL*
*NL*
So
Fred
was
gratified
with
nearly
an

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
ride
to
Stone
Court
,
which
Fred
and
Rosamond
took
the
next
morning
,
*NL*
lay
through
a
pretty
bit
of
midland
landscape
,
almost
all
meadows
and
*NL*
pastures
,
with
hedgerows
still
allowed
to
grow
in
bushy
beauty
and
to
*NL*
spread
out
coral
fruit
for
the
birds
.
Little
details
gave
each
field
a
*NL*
particular
physiognomy
,
dear
to
the
eyes
that
have
looked
on
them
from
*NL*
childhood
:
the
pool
in
the
corner
where
the
grasses
were
dank
and
trees
*NL*
leaned
whisperingly
;
the
great
oak
shadowing
a
bare
place
in
*NL*
mid-pasture
;
the
high
bank
where
the
ash-trees
grew
;
the
sudden
slope
*NL*
of
the
old
marl-pit
making
a
red
background
for
the
burdock
;
the
*NL*
huddled
roofs
and
ricks
of
the
homestead
without
a
traceable
way
of
*NL*
approach
;
the
gray
gate
and
fences
against
the
depths
of
the
bordering
*NL*
wood
;
and
the
stray
hovel
,
its
old
,
old
thatch
full
of
mossy
hills
and
*NL*
valleys
with
wondrous
modulations
of
light
and
shadow
such
as
we
travel
*NL*
far
to
see
in
later
life
,
and
see
larger
,
but
not
more
beautiful
.
*NL*
These
are
the
things
that
make
the
gamut
of
joy
in
landscape
to
*NL*
midland-bred
souls
--
the
things
they
toddled
among
,
or
perhaps
learned
*NL*
by
heart
standing
between
their
father
's
knees
while
he
drove
leisurely
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
road
,
even
the
byroad
,
was
excellent
;
for
Lowick
,
as
we
have
*NL*
seen
,
was
not
a
parish
of
muddy
lanes
and
poor
tenants
;
and
it
was
into
*NL*
Lowick
parish
that
Fred
and
Rosamond
entered
after
a
couple
of
miles
'
*NL*
riding
.
Another
mile
would
bring
them
to
Stone
Court
,
and
at
the
end
*NL*
of
the
first
half
,
the
house
was
already
visible
,
looking
as
if
it
had
*NL*
been
arrested
in
its
growth
toward
a
stone
mansion
by
an
unexpected
*NL*
budding
of
farm-buildings
on
its
left
flank
,
which
had
hindered
it
from
*NL*
becoming
anything
more
than
the
substantial
dwelling
of
a
gentleman
*NL*
farmer
.
It
was
not
the
less
agreeable
an
object
in
the
distance
for
*NL*
the
cluster
of
pinnacled
corn-ricks
which
balanced
the
fine
row
of
*NL*
walnuts
on
the
right
.
*NL*
*NL*
Presently
it
was
possible
to
discern
something
that
might
be
a
gig
on
*NL*
the
circular
drive
before
the
front
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
me
,
''
said
Rosamond
,
``
I
hope
none
of
my
uncle
's
horrible
relations
*NL*
are
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
,
though
.
That
is
Mrs.
Waule
's
gig
--
the
last
yellow
gig
left
,
*NL*
I
should
think
.
When
I
see
Mrs.
Waule
in
it
,
I
understand
how
yellow
*NL*
can
have
been
worn
for
mourning
.
That
gig
seems
to
me
more
funereal
*NL*
than
a
hearse
.
But
then
Mrs.
Waule
always
has
black
crape
on
.
How
*NL*
does
she
manage
it
,
Rosy
?
Her
friends
ca
n't
always
be
dying
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
at
all
.
And
she
is
not
in
the
least
evangelical
,
''
said
*NL*
Rosamond
,
reflectively
,
as
if
that
religious
point
of
view
would
have
*NL*
fully
accounted
for
perpetual
crape
.
``
And
,
not
poor
,
''
she
added
,
after
*NL*
a
moment
's
pause
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
by
George
!
They
are
as
rich
as
Jews
,
those
Waules
and
*NL*
Featherstones
;
I
mean
,
for
people
like
them
,
who
do
n't
want
to
spend
*NL*
anything
.
And
yet
they
hang
about
my
uncle
like
vultures
,
and
are
*NL*
afraid
of
a
farthing
going
away
from
their
side
of
the
family
.
But
I
*NL*
believe
he
hates
them
all

*NL*
*NL*
The
Mrs.
Waule
who
was
so
far
from
being
admirable
in
the
eyes
of
these
*NL*
distant
connections
,
had
happened
to
say
this
very
morning
-LRB-
not
at
all
*NL*
with
a
defiant
air
,
but
in
a
low
,
muffled
,
neutral
tone
,
as
of
a
voice
*NL*
heard
through
cotton
wool
-RRB-
that
she
did
not
wish
``
to
enjoy
their
good
*NL*
opinion
.
''
She
was
seated
,
as
she
observed
,
on
her
own
brother
's
hearth
,
*NL*
and
had
been
Jane
Featherstone
five-and-twenty
years
before
she
had
*NL*
been
Jane
Waule
,
which
entitled
her
to
speak
when
her
own
brother
's
*NL*
name
had
been
made
free
with
by
those
who
had
no
right
to
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
driving
at
there
?
''
said
Mr.
Featherstone
,
holding
his
*NL*
stick
between
his
knees
and
settling
his
wig
,
while
he
gave
her
a
*NL*
momentary
sharp
glance
,
which
seemed
to
react
on
him
like
a
draught
of
*NL*
cold
air
and
set
him
coughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Waule
had
to
defer
her
answer
till
he
was
quiet
again
,
till
Mary
*NL*
Garth
had
supplied
him
with
fresh
syrup
,
and
he
had
begun
to
rub
the
*NL*
gold
knob
of
his
stick
,
looking
bitterly
at
the
fire
.
It
was
a
bright
*NL*
fire
,
but
it
made
no
difference
to
the
chill-looking
purplish
tint
of
*NL*
Mrs.
Waule
's
face
,
which
was
as
neutral
as
her
voice
;
having
mere
*NL*
chinks
for
eyes
,
and
lips
that
hardly
moved
in
speaking
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
doctors

it

*NL*

another

Mr.

rubbed
the

had
much
the

genuineness

chuckle
over
a

Still
looking

There
was
a

so

her

Go
to
the
window
,
missy
;
I
thought
I
heard
a
horse
.
See
if
the
*NL*
doctor
's
coming
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
got
up
by
me
,
brother
,
nor
yet
by
Solomon
,
who
,
whatever
else
he
*NL*
may
be
--
and
I
do
n't
deny
he
has
oddities
--
has
made
his
will
and
parted
*NL*
his
property
equal
between
such
kin
as
he
's
friends
with
;
though
,
for
*NL*
my
part
,
I
think
there
are
times
when
some
should
be
considered
more
*NL*
than
others
.
But
Solomon
makes
it
no
secret
what
he
means
to
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
more
fool
he
!
''
said
Mr.
Featherstone
,
with
some
difficulty
;
*NL*
breaking
into
a
severe
fit
of
coughing
that
required
Mary
Garth
to
*NL*
stand
near
him
,
so
that
she
did
not
find
out
whose
horses
they
were
*NL*
which
presently
paused
stamping
on
the
gravel
before
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
Mr.
Featherstone
's
cough
was
quiet
,
Rosamond
entered
,
bearing
up
*NL*
her
riding-habit
with
much
grace
.
She
bowed
ceremoniously
to
Mrs.
*NL*
Waule
,
who
said
stiffly
,
``
How
do
you
do
,
miss
?
''
smiled
and
nodded
*NL*
silently
to
Mary
,
and
remained
standing
till
the
coughing
should
cease
,
*NL*
and
allow
her
uncle
to
notice
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Heyday
,
miss
!
''
he
said
at
last
,
``
you
have
a
fine
color
.
Where
's
Fred
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Seeing
about
the
horses
.
He
will
be
in
presently
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sit
down
,
sit
down
.
Mrs.
Waule
,
you
'd
better
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Even
those
neighbors
who
had
called
Peter
Featherstone
an
old
fox
,
had
*NL*
never
accused
him
of
being
insincerely
polite
,
and
his
sister
was
quite
*NL*
used
to
the
peculiar
absence
of
ceremony
with
which
he
marked
his
sense
*NL*
of
blood-relationship
.
Indeed
,
she
herself
was
accustomed
to
think
that
*NL*
entire
freedom
from
the
necessity
of
behaving
agreeably
was
included
in
*NL*
the
Almighty
's
intentions
about
families
.
She
rose
slowly
without
any
*NL*
sign
of
resentment
,
and
said
in
her
usual
muffled
monotone
,
``
Brother
,
I
*NL*
hope
the
new
doctor
will
be
able
to
do
something
for
you
.
Solomon
says
*NL*
there
's
great
talk
of
his
cleverness
.
I
'm
sure
it
's
my
wish
you
should
*NL*
be
spared
.
And
there
's
none
more
ready
to
nurse
you
than
your
own
*NL*
sister
and
your
own
nieces
,
if
you
'd
only
say
the
word
.
There
's
*NL*
Rebecca
,
and
Joanna
,
and
Elizabeth
,
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
ay
,
I
remember
--
you
'll
see
I
've
remembered
'em
all
--
all
dark
and
*NL*
ugly
.
They
'd
need
have
some
money
,
eh
?
There
never
was
any
beauty
in
*NL*
the
women
of
our
family
;
but
the
Featherstones
have
always
had
some
*NL*
money
,
and
the
Waules
too
.
Waule
had
money
too
.
A
warm
man
was
Waule
.
*NL*
Ay
,
ay
;
money
's
a
good
egg
;
and
if
you
've
got
money
to
leave
behind
*NL*
you
,
lay
it
in
a
warm
nest
.
Good-by
,
Mrs.
Waule
.
''
Here
Mr.
*NL*
Featherstone
pulled
at
both
sides
of
his
wig
as
if
he
wanted
to
deafen
*NL*
himself
,
and
his
sister
went
away
ruminating
on
this
oracular
speech
of
*NL*
his
.
Notwithstanding
her
jealousy
of
the
Vincys
and
of
Mary
Garth
,
*NL*
there
remained
as
the
nethermost
sediment
in
her
mental
shallows
a
*NL*
persuasion
that
her
brother
Peter
Featherstone
could
never
leave
his
*NL*
chief
property
away
from
his
blood-relations
:
--
else
,
why
had
the
*NL*
Almighty
carried
off
his
two
wives
both
childless
,
after
he
had
gained
*NL*
so
much
by
manganese
and
things
,
turning
up
when
nobody
expected
*NL*
it
?
--
and
why
was
there
a
Lowick
parish
church
,
and
the
Waules
and
*NL*
Powderells
all
sitting
in
the
same
pew
for
generations
,
and
the
*NL*
Featherstone
pew
next
to
them
,
if
,
the
Sunday
after
her
brother
Peter
's
*NL*
death
,
everybody
was
to
know
that
the
property
was
gone
out
of
the
*NL*
family
?
The
human
mind
has
at
no
period
accepted
a
moral
chaos
;
and
so
*NL*
preposterous
a
result
was
not
strictly
conceivable
.
But
we
are
*NL*
frightened
at
much
that
is
not
strictly
conceivable
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Fred
came
in
the
old
man
eyed
him
with
a
peculiar
twinkle
,
which
*NL*
the
younger
had
often
had
reason
to
interpret
as
pride
in
the
*NL*
satisfactory
details
of
his
appearance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
two
misses
go
away
,
''
said
Mr.
Featherstone
.
``
I
want
to
speak
to
*NL*
Fred
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
into
my
room
,
Rosamond
,
you
will
not
mind
the
cold
for
a
little
*NL*
while
,
''
said
Mary
.
The
two
girls
had
not
only
known
each
other
in
*NL*
childhood
,
but
had
been
at
the
same
provincial
school
together
-LRB-
Mary
as
*NL*
an
articled
pupil
-RRB-
,
so
that
they
had
many
memories
in
common
,
and
liked
*NL*
very
well
to
talk
in
private
.
Indeed
,
this
tete-a-tete
was
one
of
*NL*
Rosamond
's
objects
in
coming
to
Stone
Court
.
*NL*
*NL*
Old
Featherstone
would
not
begin
the
dialogue
till
the
door
had
been
*NL*
closed
.
He
continued
to
look
at
Fred
with
the
same
twinkle
and
with
*NL*
one
of
his
habitual
grimaces
,
alternately
screwing
and
widening
his
*NL*
mouth
;
and
when
he
spoke
,
it
was
in
a
low
tone
,
which
might
be
taken
*NL*
for
that
of
an
informer
ready
to
be
bought
off
,
rather
than
for
the
*NL*
tone
of
an
offended
senior
.
He
was
not
a
man
to
feel
any
strong
moral
*NL*
indignation
even
on
account
of
trespasses
against
himself
.
It
was
*NL*
natural
that
others
should
want
to
get
an
advantage
over
him
,
but
then
,
*NL*
he
was
a
little
too
cunning
for
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
,
sir
,
you
've
been
paying
ten
per
cent
for
money
which
you
've
*NL*
promised
to
pay
off
by
mortgaging
my
land
when
I
'm
dead
and
gone
,
eh
?
*NL*
You
put
my
life
at
a
twelvemonth
,
say
.
But
I
can
alter
my
will
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fred
blushed
.
He
had
not
borrowed
money
in
that
way
,
for
excellent
*NL*
reasons
.
But
he
was
conscious
of
having
spoken
with
some
confidence
*NL*
-LRB-
perhaps
with
more
than
he
exactly
remembered
-RRB-
about
his
prospect
of
*NL*
getting
Featherstone
's
land
as
a
future
means
of
paying
present
debts
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
what
you
refer
to
,
sir
.
I
have
certainly
never
borrowed
*NL*
any
money
on
such
an
insecurity
.
Please
do
explain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
,
it
's
you
must
explain
.
I
can
alter
my
will
yet
,
let
me
tell
*NL*
you
.
I
'm
of
sound
mind
--
can
reckon
compound
interest
in
my
head
,
and
*NL*
remember
every
fool
's
name
as
well
as
I
could
twenty
years
ago
.
What
*NL*
the
deuce
?
I
'm
under
eighty
.
I
say
,
you
must
contradict
this
story
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
contradicted
it
,
sir
,
''
Fred
answered
,
with
a
touch
of
*NL*
impatience
,
not
remembering
that
his
uncle
did
not
verbally
*NL*
discriminate
contradicting
from
disproving
,
though
no
one
was
further
*NL*
from
confounding
the
two
ideas
than
old
Featherstone
,
who
often
*NL*
wondered
that
so
many
fools
took
his
own
assertions
for
proofs
.
``
But
I
*NL*
contradict
it
again
.
The
story
is
a
silly
lie
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nonsense
!
you
must
bring
dockiments
.
It
comes
from
authority
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Name
the
authority
,
and
make
him
name
the
man
of
whom
I
borrowed
the
*NL*
money
,
and
then
I
can
disprove
the
story
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
pretty
good
authority
,
I
think
--
a
man
who
knows
most
of
what
goes
*NL*
on
in
Middlemarch
.
It
's
that
fine
,
religious
,
charitable
uncle
o
'
*NL*
yours
.
Come
now
!
''
Here
Mr.
Featherstone
had
his
peculiar
inward
shake
*NL*
which
signified
merriment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Bulstrode
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
else
,
eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
the
story
has
grown
into
this
lie
out
of
some
sermonizing
words
*NL*
he
may
have
let
fall
about
me
.
Do
they
pretend
that
he
named
the
man
*NL*
who
lent
me
the
money
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
there
is
such
a
man

depend
upon
it

knows
him

But
,
*NL*
supposing
you
only
tried
to
get
the
money
lent
,
and
did
n't
get
*NL*
it
--
Bulstrode
`
ud
know
that
too
.
You
bring
me
a
writing
from
Bulstrode
*NL*
to
say
he
does
n't
believe
you
've
ever
promised
to
pay
your
debts
out
o
'
*NL*
my
land
.
Come
now
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Featherstone
's
face
required
its
whole
scale
of
grimaces
as
a
*NL*
muscular
outlet
to
his
silent
triumph
in
the
soundness
of
his
faculties
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fred
felt
himself
to
be
in
a
disgusting
dilemma
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
be
joking
,
sir
.
Mr.
Bulstrode
,
like
other
men
,
believes
*NL*
scores
of
things
that
are
not
true
,
and
he
has
a
prejudice
against
me
.
*NL*
I
could
easily
get
him
to
write
that
he
knew
no
facts
in
proof
of
the
*NL*
report
you
speak
of
,
though
it
might
lead
to
unpleasantness
.
But
I
*NL*
could
hardly
ask
him
to
write
down
what
he
believes
or
does
not
believe
*NL*
about
me
.
''
Fred
paused
an
instant
,
and
then
added
,
in
politic
appeal
to
*NL*
his
uncle
's
vanity
,
``
That
is
hardly
a
thing
for
a
gentleman
to
ask
.
''
*NL*
But
he
was
disappointed
in
the
result
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
I
know
what
you
mean
.
You
'd
sooner
offend
me
than
Bulstrode
.
And
*NL*
what
's
he
?
--
he
's
got
no
land
hereabout
that
ever
I
heard
tell
of
.
A
*NL*
speckilating
fellow
!
He
may
come
down
any
day
,
when
the
devil
leaves
*NL*
off
backing
him
.
And
that
's
what
his
religion
means
:
he
wants
God
*NL*
A'mighty
to
come
in
.
That
's
nonsense
!
There
's
one
thing
I
made
out
*NL*
pretty
clear
when
I
used
to
go
to
church
--
and
it
's
this
:
God
A'mighty
*NL*
sticks
to
the
land
.
He
promises
land
,
and
He
gives
land
,
and
He
makes
*NL*
chaps
rich
with
corn
and
cattle
.
But
you
take
the
other
side
.
You
*NL*
like
Bulstrode
and
speckilation
better
than
Featherstone
and
land
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beg
your
pardon
,
sir
,
''
said
Fred
,
rising
,
standing
with
his
back
to
*NL*
the
fire
and
beating
his
boot
with
his
whip
.
``
I
like
neither
Bulstrode
*NL*
nor
speculation
.
''
He
spoke
rather
sulkily
,
feeling
himself
stalemated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
well
,
you
can
do
without
me
,
that
's
pretty
clear
,
''
said
old
*NL*
Featherstone
,
secretly
disliking
the
possibility
that
Fred
would
show
*NL*
himself
at
all
independent
.
``
You
neither
want
a
bit
of
land
to
make
a
*NL*
squire
of
you
instead
of
a
starving
parson
,
nor
a
lift
of
a
hundred
*NL*
pound
by
the
way
.
It
's
all
one
to
me
.
I
can
make
five
codicils
if
I
*NL*
like
,
and
I
shall
keep
my
bank-notes
for
a
nest-egg
.
It
's
all
one
to
*NL*
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fred
colored
again
.
Featherstone
had
rarely
given
him
presents
of
*NL*
money
,
and
at
this
moment
it
seemed
almost
harder
to
part
with
the
*NL*
immediate
prospect
of
bank-notes
than
with
the
more
distant
prospect
of
*NL*
the
land
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
ungrateful
,
sir
.
I
never
meant
to
show
disregard
for
any
*NL*
kind
intentions
you
might
have
towards
me
.
On
the
contrary
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
good

Then
prove
it

You
bring
me
a
letter
from
Bulstrode

believe

've
been
cracking
and
promising
to

your

out

then

if
there
's
any
scrape
you

*NL*
into

we
'll
see
if
I
ca
n't
back
you
a

Come
now

That
's
a
*NL*
bargain

Here
,
give
me
your
arm

I
'll
try
and
walk
round
the
room

*NL*
*NL*
Fred
,
in
spite
of
his
irritation
,
had
kindness
enough
in
him
to
be
a
*NL*
little
sorry
for
the
unloved
,
unvenerated
old
man
,
who
with
his
*NL*
dropsical
legs
looked
more
than
usually
pitiable
in
walking
.
While
*NL*
giving
his
arm
,
he
thought
that
he
should
not
himself
like
to
be
an
old
*NL*
fellow
with
his
constitution
breaking
up
;
and
he
waited
*NL*
good-temperedly
,
first
before
the
window
to
hear
the
wonted
remarks
*NL*
about
the
guinea-fowls
and
the
weather-cock
,
and
then
before
the
scanty
*NL*
book-shelves
,
of
which
the
chief
glories
in
dark
calf
were
Josephus
,
*NL*
Culpepper
,
Klopstock
's
``
Messiah
,
''
and
several
volumes
of
the
*NL*
``
Gentleman

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Read

the
books

Come
now

you
're
a
college
man

*NL*
*NL*
Fred
gave
him
the
titles
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
did
missy
want
with
more
books
?
What
must
you
be
bringing
her
*NL*
more
books
for

*NL*
*NL*
``
They
amuse

She

very
fond

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
little
too
fond

said
Mr.
Featherstone
,
captiously
.
``
She
was
for
*NL*
reading
when
she
sat
with

But
I
put
a
stop

's
got
the
*NL*
newspaper
to
read
out
loud

That
's
enough
for
one
day
,
I
should
think
.
*NL*
I
ca
n't
abide
to
see
her
reading
to
herself
.
You
mind
and
not
bring
*NL*
her
any
more
books
,
do
you
hear
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
,
I
hear
.
''
Fred
had
received
this
order
before
,
and
had
*NL*
secretly
disobeyed
it
.
He
intended
to
disobey
it
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ring
the
bell
,
''
said
Mr.
Featherstone
;
``
I
want
missy
to
come
down
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Rosamond
and
Mary
had
been
talking
faster
than
their
male
friends
.
*NL*
They
did
not
think
of
sitting
down
,
but
stood
at
the
toilet-table
near
*NL*
the
window
while
Rosamond
took
off
her
hat
,
adjusted
her
veil
,
and
*NL*
applied
little
touches
of
her
finger-tips
to
her
hair
--
hair
of
*NL*
infantine
fairness
,
neither
flaxen
nor
yellow
.
Mary
Garth
seemed
all
*NL*
the
plainer
standing
at
an
angle
between
the
two
nymphs
--
the
one
in
the
*NL*
glass
,
and
the
one
out
of
it
,
who
looked
at
each
other
with
eyes
of
*NL*
heavenly
blue
,
deep
enough
to
hold
the
most
exquisite
meanings
an
*NL*
ingenious
beholder
could
put
into
them
,
and
deep
enough
to
hide
the
*NL*
meanings
of
the
owner
if
these
should
happen
to
be
less
exquisite
.
*NL*
Only
a
few
children
in
Middlemarch
looked
blond
by
the
side
of
*NL*
Rosamond
,
and
the
slim
figure
displayed
by
her
riding-habit
had
*NL*
delicate
undulations
.
In
fact
,
most
men
in
Middlemarch
,
except
her
*NL*
brothers
,
held
that
Miss
Vincy
was
the
best
girl
in
the
world
,
and
some
*NL*
called
her
an
angel
.
Mary
Garth
,
on
the
contrary
,
had
the
aspect
of
an
*NL*
ordinary
sinner
:
she
was
brown
;
her
curly
dark
hair
was
rough
and
*NL*
stubborn
;
her
stature
was
low
;
and
it
would
not
be
true
to
declare
,
in
*NL*
satisfactory
antithesis
,
that
she
had
all
the
virtues
.
Plainness
has
*NL*
its
peculiar
temptations
and
vices
quite
as
much
as
beauty
;
it
is
apt
*NL*
either
to
feign
amiability
,
or
,
not
feigning
it
,
to
show
all
the
*NL*
repulsiveness
of
discontent
:
at
any
rate
,
to
be
called
an
ugly
thing
in
*NL*
contrast
with
that
lovely
creature
your
companion
,
is
apt
to
produce
*NL*
some
effect
beyond
a
sense
of
fine
veracity
and
fitness
in
the
phrase
.
*NL*
At
the
age
of
two-and-twenty
Mary
had
certainly
not
attained
that
*NL*
perfect
good
sense
and
good
principle
which
are
usually
recommended
to
*NL*
the
less
fortunate
girl
,
as
if
they
were
to
be
obtained
in
quantities
*NL*
ready
mixed
,
with
a
flavor
of
resignation
as
required
.
Her
shrewdness
*NL*
had
a
streak
of
satiric
bitterness
continually
renewed
and
never
*NL*
carried
utterly
out
of
sight
,
except
by
a
strong
current
of
gratitude
*NL*
towards
those
who
,
instead
of
telling
her
that
she
ought
to
be
*NL*
contented
,
did
something
to
make
her
so
.
Advancing
womanhood
had
*NL*
tempered
her
plainness
,
which
was
of
a
good
human
sort
,
such
as
the
*NL*
mothers
of
our
race
have
very
commonly
worn
in
all
latitudes
under
a
*NL*
more
or
less
becoming
headgear
.
Rembrandt
would
have
painted
her
with
*NL*
pleasure
,
and
would
have
made
her
broad
features
look
out
of
the
canvas
*NL*
with
intelligent
honesty
.
For
honesty
,
truth-telling
fairness
,
was
*NL*
Mary
's
reigning
virtue
:
she
neither
tried
to
create
illusions
,
nor
*NL*
indulged
in
them
for
her
own
behoof
,
and
when
she
was
in
a
good
mood
*NL*
she
had
humor
enough
in
her
to
laugh
at
herself
.
When
she
and
Rosamond
*NL*
happened
both
to
be
reflected
in
the
glass
,
she
said
,
laughingly
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
brown
patch
I
am
by
the
side
of
you
,
Rosy
!
You
are
the
most
*NL*
unbecoming
companion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
!
No
one
thinks
of
your
appearance
,
you
are
so
sensible
and
*NL*
useful
,
Mary
.
Beauty
is
of
very
little
consequence
in
reality
,
''
said
*NL*
Rosamond
,
turning
her
head
towards
Mary
,
but
with
eyes
swerving
towards
*NL*
the
new
view
of
her
neck
in
the
glass
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
mean
my
beauty
,
''
said
Mary
,
rather
sardonically
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rosamond
thought
,
``
Poor
Mary
,
she
takes
the
kindest
things
ill
.
''
Aloud
*NL*
she
said
,
``
What
have
you
been
doing
lately
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
?
Oh
,
minding
the
house
--
pouring
out
syrup
--
pretending
to
be
amiable
*NL*
and
contented
--
learning
to
have
a
bad
opinion
of
everybody
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
wretched
life
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Mary
,
curtly
,
with
a
little
toss
of
her
head
.
``
I
think
my
*NL*
life
is
pleasanter
than
your
Miss
Morgan
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
but
Miss
Morgan
is
so
uninteresting
,
and
not
young
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
interesting
to
herself
,
I
suppose
;
and
I
am
not
at
all
sure
*NL*
that
everything
gets
easier
as
one
gets
older
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Rosamond
,
reflectively
;
``
one
wonders
what
such
people
do
,
*NL*
without
any
prospect
.
To
be
sure
,
there
is
religion
as
a
support
.
*NL*
But
,
''
she
added
,
dimpling
,
``
it
is
very
different
with
you
,
Mary
.
You
*NL*
may
have
an
offer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
any
one
told
you
he
means
to
make
me
one
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
not
.
I
mean
,
there
is
a
gentleman
who
may
fall
in
love
with
*NL*
you
,
seeing
you
almost
every
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
certain
change
in
Mary
's
face
was
chiefly
determined
by
the
resolve
*NL*
not
to
show
any
change
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
that
always
make
people
fall
in
love
?
''
she
answered
,
carelessly
;
*NL*
``
it
seems
to
me
quite
as
often
a
reason
for
detesting
each
other
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
when
they
are
interesting
and
agreeable
.
I
hear
that
Mr.
Lydgate
*NL*
is
both
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Mr.
Lydgate
!
''
said
Mary
,
with
an
unmistakable
lapse
into
*NL*
indifference
.
``
You
want
to
know
something
about
him
,
''
she
added
,
not
*NL*
choosing
to
indulge
Rosamond
's
indirectness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Merely
,
how
you
like
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
no
question
of
liking
at
present
.
My
liking
always
wants
*NL*
some
little
kindness
to
kindle
it
.
I
am
not
magnanimous
enough
to
like
*NL*
people
who
speak
to
me
without
seeming
to
see
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
he
so
haughty
?
''
said
Rosamond
,
with
heightened
satisfaction
.
``
You
*NL*
know
that
he
is
of
good
family
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
he
did
not
give
that

a
reason

*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
one
describe

an
inventory

eyebrows

thick
dark
hair

large
solid

you
will
see
him

You
know
this
is
about
the
*NL*
time

his
visits

''
*NL*
*NL*
Rosamond
blushed
a
little
,
but
said
,
meditatively
,
``
I
rather
like
a
*NL*
haughty
manner

I
can
not
endure
a
rattling
young
man

*NL*

little
Mamselle
used
to
say

*NL*
*NL*

Mrs.

Waule

been
telling

that
Fred

very
unsteady

''
Mary
spoke
*NL*
from
a
girlish
impulse
which
got
the
better
of
her
judgment
.
There
was
*NL*
a
vague
uneasiness
associated
with
the
word
``
unsteady
''
which
she
hoped
*NL*
Rosamond
might
say
something
to
dissipate
.
But
she
purposely
abstained
*NL*
from
mentioning
Mrs.
Waule
's
more
special
insinuation

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Fred
is
horrid
!

said
Rosamond

She
would
not
have
allowed

herself
so
unsuitable
a
word
to
any
one
but
Mary

*NL*
*NL*

this

Mr.
Lydgate
was
rather
late
this
morning
,
but
the
visitors
stayed
long
*NL*
enough
to
see
him
;
for
Mr.
Featherstone
asked
Rosamond
to
sing
to
him
,
*NL*
and
she
herself
was
so
kind
as
to
propose
a
second
favorite
song
of
*NL*
his
--
``
Flow
on
,
thou
shining
river
''
--
after
she
had
sung
``
Home
,
sweet
*NL*
home
''
-LRB-
which
she
detested
-RRB-
.
This
hard-headed
old
Overreach
approved
of
*NL*
the
sentimental
song
,
as
the
suitable
garnish
for
girls
,
and
also
as
*NL*
fundamentally
fine
,
sentiment
being
the
right
thing
for
a
song
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Featherstone
was
still
applauding
the
last
performance
,
and
*NL*
assuring
missy
that
her
voice
was
as
clear
as
a
blackbird
's
,
when
Mr.
*NL*
Lydgate
's
horse
passed
the
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
dull
expectation
of
the
usual
disagreeable
routine
with
an
aged
*NL*
patient
--
who
can
hardly
believe
that
medicine
would
not
``
set
him
up
''
if
*NL*
the
doctor
were
only
clever
enough
--
added
to
his
general
disbelief
in
*NL*
Middlemarch
charms
,
made
a
doubly
effective
background
to
this
vision
*NL*
of
Rosamond
,
whom
old
Featherstone
made
haste
ostentatiously
to
*NL*
introduce
as
his
niece
,
though
he
had
never
thought
it
worth
while
to
*NL*
speak
of
Mary
Garth
in
that
light
.
Nothing
escaped
Lydgate
in
*NL*
Rosamond
's
graceful
behavior
:
how
delicately
she
waived
the
notice
*NL*
which
the
old
man
's
want
of
taste
had
thrust
upon
her
by
a
quiet
*NL*
gravity
,
not
showing
her
dimples
on
the
wrong
occasion
,
but
showing
*NL*
them
afterwards
in
speaking
to
Mary
,
to
whom
she
addressed
herself
with
*NL*
so
much
good-natured
interest
,
that
Lydgate
,
after
quickly
examining
*NL*
Mary
more
fully
than
he
had
done
before
,
saw
an
adorable
kindness
in
*NL*
Rosamond
's
eyes
.
But
Mary
from
some
cause
looked
rather
out
of
temper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Rosy
has
been
singing
me
a
song
--
you
've
nothing
to
say
against
*NL*
that
,
eh
,
doctor
?
''
said
Mr.
Featherstone
.
``
I
like
it
better
than
your
*NL*
physic
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
has
made
me
forget
how
the
time
was
going
,
''
said
Rosamond
,
rising
*NL*
to
reach
her
hat
,
which
she
had
laid
aside
before
singing
,
so
that
her
*NL*
flower-like
head
on
its
white
stem
was
seen
in
perfection
above-her
*NL*
riding-habit
.
``
Fred
,
we
must
really
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
good
,
''
said
Fred
,
who
had
his
own
reasons
for
not
being
in
the
*NL*
best
spirits
,
and
wanted
to
get
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Vincy
is
a
musician
?
''
said
Lydgate
,
following
her
with
his
eyes
.
*NL*
-LRB-
Every
nerve
and
muscle
in
Rosamond
was
adjusted
to
the
consciousness
*NL*
that
she
was
being
looked
at
.
She
was
by
nature
an
actress
of
parts
*NL*
that
entered
into
her
physique
:
she
even
acted
her
own
character
,
and
*NL*
so
well
,
that
she
did
not
know
it
to
be
precisely
her
own
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
best
in
Middlemarch
,
I
'll
be
bound
,
''
said
Mr.
Featherstone
,
``
let
*NL*
the
next
be
who
she
will
.
Eh
,
Fred
?
Speak
up
for
your
sister
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
afraid
I
'm
out
of
court
,
sir
.
My
evidence
would
be
good
for
*NL*
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Middlemarch
has
not
a
very
high
standard
,
uncle
,
''
said
Rosamond
,
with
*NL*
a
pretty
lightness
,
going
towards
her
whip
,
which
lay
at
a
distance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lydgate
was
quick
in
anticipating
her
.
He
reached
the
whip
before
she
*NL*
did
,
and
turned
to
present
it
to
her
.
She
bowed
and
looked
at
him
:
he
*NL*
of
course
was
looking
at
her
,
and
their
eyes
met
with
that
peculiar
*NL*
meeting
which
is
never
arrived
at
by
effort
,
but
seems
like
a
sudden
*NL*
divine
clearance
of
haze
.
I
think
Lydgate
turned
a
little
paler
than
*NL*
usual
,
but
Rosamond
blushed
deeply
and
felt
a
certain
astonishment
.
*NL*
After
that
,
she
was
really
anxious
to
go
,
and
did
not
know
what
sort
of
*NL*
stupidity
her
uncle
was
talking
of
when
she
went
to
shake
hands
with
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
this
result
,
which
she
took
to
be
a
mutual
impression
,
called
*NL*
falling
in
love
,
was
just
what
Rosamond
had
contemplated
beforehand
.
*NL*
Ever
since
that
important
new
arrival
in
Middlemarch
she
had
woven
a
*NL*
little
future
,
of
which
something
like
this
scene
was
the
necessary
*NL*
beginning
.
Strangers
,
whether
wrecked
and
clinging
to
a
raft
,
or
duly
*NL*
escorted
and
accompanied
by
portmanteaus
,
have
always
had
a
*NL*
circumstantial
fascination
for
the
virgin
mind
,
against
which
native
*NL*
merit
has
urged
itself
in
vain
.
And
a
stranger
was
absolutely
*NL*
necessary
to
Rosamond
's
social
romance
,
which
had
always
turned
on
a
*NL*
lover
and
bridegroom
who
was
not
a
Middlemarcher
,
and
who
had
no
*NL*
connections
at
all
like
her
own
:
of
late
,
indeed
,
the
construction
*NL*
seemed
to
demand
that
he
should
somehow
be
related
to
a
baronet
.
Now
*NL*
that
she
and
the
stranger
had
met
,
reality
proved
much
more
moving
than
*NL*
anticipation
,
and
Rosamond
could
not
doubt
that
this
was
the
great
*NL*
epoch
of
her
life
.
She
judged
of
her
own
symptoms
as
those
of
*NL*
awakening
love
,
and
she
held
it
still
more
natural
that
Mr.
Lydgate
*NL*
should
have
fallen
in
love
at
first
sight
of
her
.
These
things
*NL*
happened
so
often
at
balls
,
and
why
not
by
the
morning
light
,
when
the
*NL*
complexion
showed
all
the
better
for
it
?
Rosamond
,
though
no
older
*NL*
than
Mary
,
was
rather
used
to
being
fallen
in
love
with
;
but
she
,
for
*NL*
her
part
,
had
remained
indifferent
and
fastidiously
critical
towards
*NL*
both
fresh
sprig
and
faded
bachelor
.
And
here
was
Mr.
Lydgate
suddenly
*NL*
corresponding
to
her
ideal
,
being
altogether
foreign
to
Middlemarch
,
*NL*
carrying
a
certain
air
of
distinction
congruous
with
good
family
,
and
*NL*
possessing
connections
which
offered
vistas
of
that
middle-class
*NL*
heaven
,
rank
;
a
man
of
talent
,
also
,
whom
it
would
be
especially
*NL*
delightful
to
enslave
:
in
fact
,
a
man
who
had
touched
her
nature
quite
*NL*
newly
,
and
brought
a
vivid
interest
into
her
life
which
was
better
than
*NL*
any
fancied
``
might-be
''
such
as
she
was
in
the
habit
of
opposing
to
the
*NL*
actual
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
,
in
riding
home
,
both
the
brother
and
the
sister
were
preoccupied
*NL*
and
inclined
to
be
silent
.
Rosamond
,
whose
basis
for
her
structure
had
*NL*
the
usual
airy
slightness
,
was
of
remarkably
detailed
and
realistic
*NL*
imagination
when
the
foundation
had
been
once
presupposed
;
and
before
*NL*
they
had
ridden
a
mile
she
was
far
on
in
the
costume
and
introductions
*NL*
of
her
wedded
life
,
having
determined
on
her
house
in
Middlemarch
,
and
*NL*
foreseen
the
visits
she
would
pay
to
her
husband
's
high-bred
relatives
*NL*
at
a
distance
,
whose
finished
manners
she
could
appropriate
as
*NL*
thoroughly
as
she
had
done
her
school
accomplishments
,
preparing
*NL*
herself
thus
for
vaguer
elevations
which
might
ultimately
come
.
There
*NL*
was
nothing
financial
,
still
less
sordid
,
in
her
previsions
:
she
cared
*NL*
about
what
were
considered
refinements
,
and
not
about
the
money
that
*NL*
was
to
pay
for
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fred
's
mind
,
on
the
other
hand
,
was
busy
with
an
anxiety
which
even
his
*NL*
ready
hopefulness
could
not
immediately
quell
.
He
saw
no
way
of
*NL*
eluding
Featherstone
's
stupid
demand
without
incurring
consequences
*NL*
which
he
liked
less
even
than
the
task
of
fulfilling
it
.
His
father
*NL*
was
already
out
of
humor
with
him
,
and
would
be
still
more
so
if
he
*NL*
were
the
occasion
of
any
additional
coolness
between
his
own
family
and
*NL*
the
Bulstrodes
.
Then
,
he
himself
hated
having
to
go
and
speak
to
his
*NL*
uncle
Bulstrode
,
and
perhaps
after
drinking
wine
he
had
said
many
*NL*
foolish
things
about
Featherstone
's
property
,
and
these
had
been
*NL*
magnified
by
report
.
Fred
felt
that
he
made
a
wretched
figure
as
a
*NL*
fellow
who
bragged
about
expectations
from
a
queer
old
miser
like
*NL*
Featherstone
,
and
went
to
beg
for
certificates
at
his
bidding
.
*NL*
But
--
those
expectations
!
He
really
had
them
,
and
he
saw
no
agreeable
*NL*
alternative
if
he
gave
them
up
;
besides
,
he
had
lately
made
a
debt
*NL*
which
galled
him
extremely
,
and
old
Featherstone
had
almost
bargained
*NL*
to
pay
it
off
.
The
whole
affair
was
miserably
small
:
his
debts
were
*NL*
small
,
even
his
expectations
were
not
anything
so
very
magnificent
.
*NL*
Fred
had
known
men
to
whom
he
would
have
been
ashamed
of
confessing
the
*NL*
smallness
of
his
scrapes
.
Such
ruminations
naturally
produced
a
streak
*NL*
of
misanthropic
bitterness
.
To
be
born
the
son
of
a
Middlemarch
*NL*
manufacturer
,
and
inevitable
heir
to
nothing
in
particular
,
while
such
*NL*
men
as
Mainwaring
and
Vyan
--
certainly
life
was
a
poor
business
,
when
a
*NL*
spirited
young
fellow
,
with
a
good
appetite
for
the
best
of
everything
,
*NL*
had
so
poor
an
outlook
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
had
not
occurred
to
Fred
that
the
introduction
of
Bulstrode
's
name
*NL*
in
the
matter
was
a
fiction
of
old
Featherstone
's
;
nor
could
this
have
*NL*
made
any
difference
to
his
position
.
He
saw
plainly
enough
that
the
*NL*
old
man
wanted
to
exercise
his
power
by
tormenting
him
a
little
,
and
*NL*
also
probably
to
get
some
satisfaction
out
of
seeing
him
on
unpleasant
*NL*
terms
with
Bulstrode
.
Fred
fancied
that
he
saw
to
the
bottom
of
his
*NL*
uncle
Featherstone
's
soul
,
though
in
reality
half
what
he
saw
there
was
*NL*
no
more
than
the
reflex
of
his
own
inclinations
.
The
difficult
task
of
*NL*
knowing
another
soul
is
not
for
young
gentlemen
whose
consciousness
is
*NL*
chiefly
made
up
of
their
own
wishes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fred
's
main
point
of
debate
with
himself
was
,
whether
he
should
tell
*NL*
his
father
,
or
try
to
get
through
the
affair
without
his
father
's
*NL*
knowledge
.
It
was
probably
Mrs.
Waule
who
had
been
talking
about
him
;
*NL*
and
if
Mary
Garth
had
repeated
Mrs.
Waule
's
report
to
Rosamond
,
it
*NL*
would
be
sure
to
reach
his
father
,
who
would
as
surely
question
him
*NL*
about
it
.
He
said
to
Rosamond
,
as
they
slackened
their
pace
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rosy
,
did
Mary
tell
you
that
Mrs.
Waule
had
said
anything
about
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
indeed
,
she
did
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
you
were
very
unsteady
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
that
all
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
think
that
was
enough
,
Fred
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
sure
she
said
no
more
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mary
mentioned
nothing
else
.
But
really
,
Fred
,
I
think
you
ought
to
*NL*
be
ashamed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
fudge
!
Do
n't
lecture
me
.
What
did
Mary
say
about
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
obliged
to
tell
you
.
You
care
so
very
much
what
Mary
says
,
*NL*
and
you
are
too
rude
to
allow
me
to
speak
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
I
care
what
Mary
says
.
She
is
the
best
girl
I
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
never
have
thought
she
was
a
girl
to
fall
in
love
with
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
know
what
men
would
fall
in
love
with
?
Girls
never
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
least
,
Fred
,
let
me
advise
_
you
_
not
to
fall
in
love
with
her
,
for
*NL*
she
says
she
would
not
marry
you
if
you
asked
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
might
have
waited
till
I
did
ask
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
knew
it
would
nettle
you

Fred

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all
.
She
would
not
have
said
so
if
you
had
not
provoked
her
.
''
*NL*
Before
reaching
home
,
Fred
concluded
that
he
would
tell
the
whole
*NL*
affair
as
simply
as
possible
to
his
father
,
who
might
perhaps
take
on
*NL*
himself
the
unpleasant
business
of
speaking
to
Bulstrode

1st
Gent

How
class
your
man
?
--
as
better
than
the
most
,
*NL*
Or
,
seeming
better
,
worse
beneath
that

?

As

pilgrim
or
hypocrite

Gent
.
Nay
,
tell
me
how
you
class
your
wealth
of
books
*NL*
The
drifted
relics
of
all
time
.
*NL*
As
well
sort
them
at
once
by
size
and
livery
:
*NL*
Vellum
,
tall
copies
,
and
the
common
calf
*NL*
Will
hardly
cover
more
diversity
*NL*
Than
all
your
labels
cunningly
devised
*NL*
To
class
your
unread
authors
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
In
consequence
of
what
he
had
heard
from
Fred
,
Mr.
Vincy
determined
to
*NL*
speak
with
Mr.
Bulstrode
in
his
private
room
at
the
Bank
at
half-past
*NL*
one
,
when
he
was
usually
free
from
other
callers
.
But
a
visitor
had
*NL*
come
in
at
one
o'clock
,
and
Mr.
Bulstrode
had
so
much
to
say
to
him
,
*NL*
that
there
was
little
chance
of
the
interview
being
over
in
half
an
*NL*
hour
.
The
banker
's
speech
was
fluent
,
but
it
was
also
copious
,
and
he
*NL*
used
up
an
appreciable
amount
of
time
in
brief
meditative
pauses
.
Do
*NL*
not
imagine
his
sickly
aspect
to
have
been
of
the
yellow
,
black-haired
*NL*
sort
:
he
had
a
pale
blond
skin
,
thin
gray-besprinkled
brown
hair
,
*NL*
light-gray
eyes
,
and
a
large
forehead
.
Loud
men
called
his
subdued
*NL*
tone
an
undertone
,
and
sometimes
implied
that
it
was
inconsistent
with
*NL*
openness
;
though
there
seems
to
be
no
reason
why
a
loud
man
should
not
*NL*
be
given
to
concealment
of
anything
except
his
own
voice
,
unless
it
can
*NL*
be
shown
that
Holy
Writ
has
placed
the
seat
of
candor
in
the
lungs
.
*NL*
Mr.
Bulstrode
had
also
a
deferential
bending
attitude
in
listening
,
and
*NL*
an
apparently
fixed
attentiveness
in
his
eyes
which
made
those
persons
*NL*
who
thought
themselves
worth
hearing
infer
that
he
was
seeking
the
*NL*
utmost
improvement
from
their
discourse
.
Others
,
who
expected
to
make
*NL*
no
great
figure
,
disliked
this
kind
of
moral
lantern
turned
on
them
.
*NL*
If
you
are
not
proud
of
your
cellar
,
there
is
no
thrill
of
satisfaction
*NL*
in
seeing
your
guest
hold
up
his
wine-glass
to
the
light
and
look
*NL*
judicial
.
Such
joys
are
reserved
for
conscious
merit
.
Hence
Mr.
*NL*
Bulstrode
's
close
attention
was
not
agreeable
to
the
publicans
and
*NL*
sinners
in
Middlemarch
;
it
was
attributed
by
some
to
his
being
a
*NL*
Pharisee
,
and
by
others
to
his
being
Evangelical
.
Less
superficial
*NL*
reasoners
among
them
wished
to
know
who
his
father
and
grandfather
*NL*
were
,
observing
that
five-and-twenty
years
ago
nobody
had
ever
heard
of
*NL*
a
Bulstrode
in
Middlemarch
.
To
his
present
visitor
,
Lydgate
,
the
*NL*
scrutinizing
look
was
a
matter
of
indifference
:
he
simply
formed
an
*NL*
unfavorable
opinion
of
the
banker
's
constitution
,
and
concluded
that
he
*NL*
had
an
eager
inward
life
with
little
enjoyment
of
tangible
things
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
be
exceedingly
obliged
if
you
will
look
in
on
me
here
*NL*
occasionally
,
Mr.
Lydgate
,
''
the
banker
observed
,
after
a
brief
pause
.
*NL*
``
If
,
as
I
dare
to
hope
,
I
have
the
privilege
of
finding
you
a
valuable
*NL*
coadjutor
in
the
interesting
matter
of
hospital
management
,
there
will
*NL*
be
many
questions
which
we
shall
need
to
discuss
in
private
.
As
to
the
*NL*
new
hospital
,
which
is
nearly
finished
,
I
shall
consider
what
you
have
*NL*
said
about
the
advantages
of
the
special
destination
for
fevers
.
The
*NL*
decision
will
rest
with
me
,
for
though
Lord
Medlicote
has
given
the
*NL*
land
and
timber
for
the
building
,
he
is
not
disposed
to
give
his
*NL*
personal
attention
to
the
object
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
few
things
better
worth
the
pains
in
a
provincial
town
like
*NL*
this
,
''
said
Lydgate
.
``
A
fine
fever
hospital
in
addition
to
the
old
*NL*
infirmary
might
be
the
nucleus
of
a
medical
school
here
,
when
once
we
*NL*
get
our
medical
reforms
;
and
what
would
do
more
for
medical
education
*NL*
than
the
spread
of
such
schools
over
the
country
?
A
born
provincial
*NL*
man
who
has
a
grain
of
public
spirit
as
well
as
a
few
ideas
,
should
do
*NL*
what
he
can
to
resist
the
rush
of
everything
that
is
a
little
better
*NL*
than
common
towards
London
.
Any
valid
professional
aims
may
often
find
*NL*
a
freer
,
if
not
a
richer
field
,
in
the
provinces
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
Lydgate
's
gifts
was
a
voice
habitually
deep
and
sonorous
,
yet
*NL*
capable
of
becoming
very
low
and
gentle
at
the
right
moment
.
About
his
*NL*
ordinary
bearing
there
was
a
certain
fling
,
a
fearless
expectation
of
*NL*
success
,
a
confidence
in
his
own
powers
and
integrity
much
fortified
by
*NL*
contempt
for
petty
obstacles
or
seductions
of
which
he
had
had
no
*NL*
experience
.
But
this
proud
openness
was
made
lovable
by
an
expression
*NL*
of
unaffected
good-will
.
Mr.
Bulstrode
perhaps
liked
him
the
better
for
*NL*
the
difference
between
them
in
pitch
and
manners
;
he
certainly
liked
*NL*
him
the
better
,
as
Rosamond
did
,
for
being
a
stranger
in
Middlemarch
.
*NL*
One
can
begin
so
many
things
with
a
new
person
!
--
even
begin
to
be
a
*NL*
better
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
rejoice
to
furnish
your
zeal
with
fuller
opportunities
,
''
Mr.
*NL*
Bulstrode
answered
;
``
I
mean
,
by
confiding
to
you
the
superintendence
of
*NL*
my
new
hospital
,
should
a
maturer
knowledge
favor
that
issue
,
for
I
am
*NL*
determined
that
so
great
an
object
shall
not
be
shackled
by
our
two
*NL*
physicians
.
Indeed
,
I
am
encouraged
to
consider
your
advent
to
this
*NL*
town
as
a
gracious
indication
that
a
more
manifest
blessing
is
now
to
*NL*
be
awarded
to
my
efforts
,
which
have
hitherto
been
much
with
stood
.
*NL*
With
regard
to
the
old
infirmary
,
we
have
gained
the
initial
point
--
I
*NL*
mean
your
election
.
And
now
I
hope
you
will
not
shrink
from
incurring
*NL*
a
certain
amount
of
jealousy
and
dislike
from
your
professional
*NL*
brethren
by
presenting
yourself
as
a
reformer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
not
profess
bravery
,
''
said
Lydgate
,
smiling
,
``
but
I
acknowledge
*NL*
a
good
deal
of
pleasure
in
fighting
,
and
I
should
not
care
for
my
*NL*
profession
,
if
I
did
not
believe
that
better
methods
were
to
be
found
*NL*
and
enforced
there
as
well
as
everywhere
else
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
standard
of
that
profession
is
low
in
Middlemarch
,
my
dear
sir
,
''
*NL*
said
the
banker
.
``
I
mean
in
knowledge
and
skill
;
not
in
social
status
,
*NL*
for
our
medical
men
are
most
of
them
connected
with
respectable
*NL*
townspeople
here
.
My
own
imperfect
health
has
induced
me
to
give
some
*NL*
attention
to
those
palliative
resources
which
the
divine
mercy
has
*NL*
placed
within
our
reach
.
I
have
consulted
eminent
men
in
the
*NL*
metropolis
,
and
I
am
painfully
aware
of
the
backwardness
under
which
*NL*
medical
treatment
labors
in
our
provincial
districts
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
--
with
our
present
medical
rules
and
education
,
one
must
be
*NL*
satisfied
now
and
then
to
meet
with
a
fair
practitioner
.
As
to
all
the
*NL*
higher
questions
which
determine
the
starting-point
of
a
diagnosis
--
as
*NL*
to
the
philosophy
of
medical
evidence
--
any
glimmering
of
these
can
only
*NL*
come
from
a
scientific
culture
of
which
country
practitioners
have
*NL*
usually
no
more
notion
than
the
man
in
the
moon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bulstrode
,
bending
and
looking
intently
,
found
the
form
which
*NL*
Lydgate
had
given
to
his
agreement
not
quite
suited
to
his
*NL*
comprehension
.
Under
such
circumstances
a
judicious
man
changes
the
*NL*
topic
and
enters
on
ground
where
his
own
gifts
may
be
more
useful
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
aware
,
''
he
said
,
``
that
the
peculiar
bias
of
medical
ability
is
*NL*
towards
material
means
.
Nevertheless
,
Mr.
Lydgate
,
I
hope
we
shall
not
*NL*
vary
in
sentiment
as
to
a
measure
in
which
you
are
not
likely
to
be
*NL*
actively
concerned
,
but
in
which
your
sympathetic
concurrence
may
be
an
*NL*
aid
to
me
.
You
recognize
,
I
hope
;
the
existence
of
spiritual
interests
*NL*
in
your
patients
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
I
do
.
But
those
words
are
apt
to
cover
different
meanings
*NL*
to
different
minds
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Precisely
.
And
on
such
subjects
wrong
teaching
is
as
fatal
as
no
*NL*
teaching
.
Now
a
point
which
I
have
much
at
heart
to
secure
is
a
new
*NL*
regulation
as
to
clerical
attendance
at
the
old
infirmary
.
The
*NL*
building
stands
in
Mr.
Farebrother

parish

You
know
Mr.
Farebrother

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
seen
him

He
gave
me
his
vote

I
must
call

naturalist

*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Farebrother

my

is
a
man
deeply
painful
to
contemplate

I
suppose
there
is
not
a
clergyman
in
this
country
who
has
greater
*NL*
talents

''
Mr.
Bulstrode
paused
and
looked
meditative
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
not
yet
been
pained
by
finding
any
excessive
talent
in
*NL*
Middlemarch
,
''
said
Lydgate
,
bluntly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
I
desire
,
''
Mr.
Bulstrode
continued
,
looking
still
more
serious
,
*NL*
``
is
that
Mr.
Farebrother
's
attendance
at
the
hospital
should
be
*NL*
superseded
by
the
appointment
of
a
chaplain

of
Mr.
Tyke
,
in
fact
--
and
*NL*
that
no
other
spiritual
aid
should
be
called
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
a
medical
man
I
could
have
no
opinion
on
such
a
point
unless
I
knew
*NL*
Mr.
Tyke
,
and
even
then
I
should
require
to
know
the
cases
in
which
he
*NL*
was
applied
.
''
Lydgate
smiled
,
but
he
was
bent
on
being
circumspect
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
you
can
not
enter
fully
into
the
merits
of
this
measure
at
*NL*
present
.
But
''
--
here
Mr.
Bulstrode
began
to
speak
with
a
more
chiselled
*NL*
emphasis
--
``
the
subject
is
likely
to
be
referred
to
the
medical
board
of
*NL*
the
infirmary
,
and
what
I
trust
I
may
ask
of
you
is
,
that
in
virtue
of
*NL*
the
cooperation
between
us
which
I
now
look
forward
to
,
you
will
not
,
*NL*
so
far
as
you
are
concerned
,
be
influenced
by
my
opponents
in
this
*NL*
matter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
I
shall
have
nothing
to
do
with
clerical
disputes
,
''
said
*NL*
Lydgate
.
``
The
path
I
have
chosen
is
to
work
well
in
my
own
profession
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
responsibility
,
Mr.
Lydgate
,
is
of
a
broader
kind
.
With
me
,
*NL*
indeed
,
this
question
is
one
of
sacred
accountableness
;
whereas
with
my
*NL*
opponents
,
I
have
good
reason
to
say
that
it
is
an
occasion
for
*NL*
gratifying
a
spirit
of
worldly
opposition

But
I
shall
not
therefore
*NL*
drop
one
iota
of
my
convictions
,
or
cease
to
identify
myself
with
that
*NL*
truth
which
an
evil
generation
hates
.
I
have
devoted
myself
to
this
*NL*
object
of
hospital-improvement
,
but
I
will
boldly
confess
to
you
,
Mr.
*NL*
Lydgate
,
that
I
should
have
no
interest
in
hospitals
if
I
believed
that
*NL*
nothing
more
was
concerned
therein
than
the
cure
of
mortal
diseases
.
I
*NL*
have
another
ground
of
action
,
and
in
the
face
of
persecution
I
will
*NL*
not
conceal
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bulstrode
's
voice
had
become
a
loud
and
agitated
whisper
as
he
said
*NL*
the
last
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
we
certainly
differ
,
''
said
Lydgate
.
But
he
was
not
sorry
that
*NL*
the
door
was
now
opened
,
and
Mr.
Vincy
was
announced
.
That
florid
*NL*
sociable
personage
was
become
more
interesting
to
him
since
he
had
seen
*NL*
Rosamond
.
Not
that
,
like
her
,
he
had
been
weaving
any
future
in
which
*NL*
their
lots
were
united
;
but
a
man
naturally
remembers
a
charming
girl
*NL*
with
pleasure
,
and
is
willing
to
dine
where
he
may
see
her
again
.
*NL*
Before
he
took
leave
,
Mr.
Vincy
had
given
that
invitation
which
he
had
*NL*
been
``
in
no
hurry
about

''
for
Rosamond
at
breakfast
had
mentioned
that
*NL*
she
thought
her
uncle
Featherstone
had
taken
the
new
doctor
into
great
*NL*
favor

*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bulstrode
,
alone
with
his
brother-in-law
,
poured
himself
out
a
*NL*
glass
of
water
,
and
opened
a
sandwich-box
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

said
Mr.

Vincy
,
unable
to
omit
his
portable
theory

``
However

he
went
on
,
*NL*
accenting
the
word
,
as
if
to
dismiss
all
irrelevance
,
``
what
I

here

out

telling

expensive

has
succeeded

nothing

in
*NL*
giving
him
extravagant
idle
habits

are
now
reaping
the

consequences

*NL*
*NL*
To
point
out
other
people
's
errors
was
a
duty
that
Mr.
Bulstrode
rarely
*NL*
shrank
from
,
but
Mr.
Vincy
was
not
equally
prepared
to
be
patient

When
a
man
has
the
immediate
prospect
of
being
mayor
,

is
ready
,
in
*NL*
the
interests
of
commerce
,
to
take
up
a
firm
attitude
on
politics
*NL*
generally
,
he
has
naturally
a
sense
of
his
importance
to
the
framework
*NL*
of
things
which
seems
to
throw
questions
of
private
conduct
into
the
*NL*
background
.
And
this
particular
reproof
irritated
him
more
than
any
*NL*
other
.
It
was
eminently
superfluous
to
him
to
be
told
that
he
was
*NL*
reaping
the
consequences
.
But
he
felt
his
neck
under
Bulstrode
's
yoke
;
*NL*
and
though
he
usually
enjoyed
kicking
,
he
was
anxious
to
refrain
from
*NL*
that
relief
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
to
that

Bulstrode

it
's
no

back

I
do

I
could

foresee
everything

trade

there
was

a
finer
business
in
Middlemarch

ours

the

clever

My
poor

would

done
well

that

him
off

said
Mr.

finishing
his

thrown

back
in

Yes

yes

The
long

of

somebody

you
as
the
authority

that
Fred

been
borrowing

to
borrow
money

Of

you

never
said

But
the

insist
on
it

that

should
bring
him
a
denial
in

that
is

just
*NL*
a

of
a
note

either
*NL*
of

having
borrowed

tried
to
borrow
in
such
a

suppose
you
can
have
no

do

*NL*
*NL*
``
Pardon
me

I
have
an

that

foolish

to
supply
him
on

vague
a

presumption

lax
money-lending
as
of
other

folly

But
Fred

I

future
possession

to

pen
this

of
affidavit

profitable

that

all

Mr.

burst
out
very
bluntly
.
``
It
may
be
for

it

Mr.

paused
a
little
before

answered

still
less

make

clear

becomes

complain
of

withholding
material

the
worldly
position

must
remind
you

thoroughly
nettled

a
result

seldom

retarded

previous

more

strain
at

refuse

*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Vincy
rose
,
began
to
button
his
great-coat
,
and
looked
steadily
at
*NL*
his
brother-in-law
,
meaning
to
imply
a
demand
for
a
decisive
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
not
the
first
time
that
Mr.
Bulstrode
had
begun
by
admonishing
*NL*
Mr.
Vincy
,
and
had
ended
by
seeing
a
very
unsatisfactory
reflection
of
*NL*
himself
in
the
coarse
unflattering
mirror
which
that
manufacturer
's
*NL*
mind
presented
to
the
subtler
lights
and
shadows
of
his
fellow-men
;
and
*NL*
perhaps
his
experience
ought
to
have
warned
him
how
the
scene
would
*NL*
end
.
But
a
full-fed
fountain
will
be
generous
with
its
waters
even
in
*NL*
the
rain
,
when
they
are
worse
than
useless
;
and
a
fine
fount
of
*NL*
admonition
is
apt
to
be
equally
irrepressible
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
in
Mr.
Bulstrode
's
nature
to
comply
directly
in
consequence
*NL*
of
uncomfortable
suggestions
.
Before
changing
his
course
,
he
always
*NL*
needed
to
shape
his
motives
and
bring
them
into
accordance
with
his
*NL*
habitual
standard

He
said
,
at
last
--

*NL*
``

Mr.
Bulstrode
's
consultation
of
Harriet
seemed
to
have
had
the
effect
*NL*
desired
by
Mr.
Vincy
,
for
early
the
next
morning
a
letter
came
which
*NL*
Fred
could
carry
to
Mr.
Featherstone
as
the
required
testimony
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
gentleman
was
staying
in
bed
on
account
of
the
cold
weather
,
*NL*
and
as
Mary
Garth
was
not
to
be
seen
in
the
sitting-room
,
Fred
went
*NL*
up-stairs
immediately
and
presented
the
letter
to
his
uncle
,
who
,
*NL*
propped
up
comfortably
on
a
bed-rest
,
was
not
less
able
than
usual
to
*NL*
enjoy
his
consciousness
of
wisdom
in
distrusting
and
frustrating
*NL*
mankind
.
He
put
on
his
spectacles
to
read
the
letter
,
pursing
up
his
*NL*
lips
and
drawing
down
their
corners
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Under
the
circumstances
I
will
not
decline
to
state
my
*NL*
conviction
--
tchah
!
what
fine
words
the
fellow
puts
!
He
's
as
fine
as
an
*NL*
auctioneer
--
that
your
son
Frederic
has
not
obtained
any
advance
of
*NL*
money
on
bequests
promised
by
Mr.

promised

I
promise
nothing

I
shall
make
codicils

I
like

and
that
considering
the
nature
of
such
a
proceeding
,
it
is
*NL*
unreasonable
to
presume
that
a
young
man
of
sense
and
character
would
*NL*
attempt
it

ah

the
gentleman
does
n't
say

As
to
my
own
concern

any
*NL*
report
of
such
a
nature

I
distinctly
affirm
that
I
never
made
any
*NL*
statement
to
the

that
your
son
had
borrowed
money
on
any
*NL*
property
that
might
accrue
to
him
on
Mr.

Well

Mr.
*NL*
Featherstone
here
looked
over
his
spectacles
at
Fred
,
while
he
handed
*NL*
back
the
letter
to
him
with
a
contemptuous
gesture
,
``
you

writes
it
out
fine

*NL*
*NL*
Fred
colored
.
``
You

should
think
it

told
you

denies

said
Mr.

curtly
,
keeping
on
his

spectacles
,
but
withdrawing
his
hands
under
his
wraps
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
expect
nothing

Fred
with
difficulty
restrained
himself
from
*NL*
venting
his
irritation
.
``
I
came
to
bring
you
the
letter

you
like

you
good

a
servant
who
came
in
answer
to
the
bell
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell

said
Mr.
Featherstone
,
impatiently
.
``

had

go
away

He
spoke
in

tone
when

came

*NL*
``
Why
could
n't
you
sit
still
here

I
told

always
to
put

bed

*NL*
*NL*
Mary
's
eyes
looked
rather
red
,
as
if
she
had
been
crying
.
It
was
clear
*NL*
that
Mr.
Featherstone
was
in
one
of
his
most
snappish
humors
this
*NL*
morning
,
and
though
Fred
had
now
the
prospect
of
receiving
the
*NL*
much-needed
present
of
money
,
he
would
have
preferred
being
free
to
*NL*
turn
round
on
the
old
tyrant
and
tell
him
that
Mary
Garth
was
too
good
*NL*
to
be
at
his
beck
.
Though
Fred
had
risen
as
she
entered
the
room
,
she
*NL*
had
barely
noticed
him
,
and
looked
as
if
her
nerves
were
quivering
with
*NL*
the
expectation
that
something
would
be
thrown
at
her
.
But
she
never
*NL*
had
anything
worse
than
words
to
dread
.
When
she
went
to
reach
the
*NL*
waistcoat
from
a
peg
,
Fred
went
up
to
her
and
said
,
``
Allow
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
it
alone
!
You
bring
it
,
missy
,
and
lay
it
down
here
,
''
said
Mr.
*NL*
Featherstone
.
``
Now
you
go
away
again
till
I
call
you
,
''
he
added
,
when
*NL*
the
waistcoat
was
laid
down
by
him
.
It
was
usual
with
him
to
season
*NL*
his
pleasure
in
showing
favor
to
one
person
by
being
especially
*NL*
disagreeable
to
another
,
and
Mary
was
always
at
hand
to
furnish
the
*NL*
condiment
.
When
his
own
relatives
came
she
was
treated
better
.
Slowly
*NL*
he
took
out
a
bunch
of
keys
from
the
waistcoat
pocket
,
and
slowly
he
*NL*
drew
forth
a
tin
box
which
was
under
the
bed-clothes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
expect
I
am
going
to
give
you
a
little
fortune
,
eh
?
''
he
said
,
*NL*
looking
above
his
spectacles
and
pausing
in
the
act
of
opening
the
lid
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all
,
sir
.
You
were
good
enough
to
speak
of
making
me
a
present
*NL*
the
other
day
,
else
,
of
course
,
I
should
not
have
thought
of
the
*NL*
matter
.
''
But
Fred
was
of
a
hopeful
disposition
,
and
a
vision
had
*NL*
presented
itself
of
a
sum
just
large
enough
to
deliver
him
from
a
*NL*
certain
anxiety
.
When
Fred
got
into
debt
,
it
always
seemed
to
him
*NL*
highly
probable
that
something
or
other
--
he
did
not
necessarily
*NL*
conceive
what
--
would
come
to
pass
enabling
him
to
pay
in
due
time
.
And
*NL*
now
that
the
providential
occurrence
was
apparently
close
at
hand
,
it
*NL*
would
have
been
sheer
absurdity
to
think
that
the
supply
would
be
short
*NL*
of
the
need
:
as
absurd
as
a
faith
that
believed
in
half
a
miracle
for
*NL*
want
of
strength
to
believe
in
a
whole
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
deep-veined
hands
fingered
many
bank-notes-one
after
the
other
,
*NL*
laying
them
down
flat
again
,
while
Fred
leaned
back
in
his
chair
,
*NL*
scorning
to
look
eager
.
He
held
himself
to
be
a
gentleman
at
heart
,
*NL*
and
did
not
like
courting
an
old
fellow
for
his
money
.
At
last
,
Mr.
*NL*
Featherstone
eyed
him
again
over
his
spectacles
and
presented
him
with
*NL*
a
little
sheaf
of
notes
:
Fred
could
see
distinctly
that
there
were
but
*NL*
five
,
as
the
less
significant
edges
gaped
towards
him
.
But
then
,
each
*NL*
might
mean
fifty
pounds
.
He
took
them
,
saying
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
,
sir
,
''
and
was
going
to
roll
them
up
*NL*
without
seeming
to
think
of
their
value
.
But
this
did
not
suit
Mr.
*NL*
Featherstone
,
who
was
eying
him
intently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
do
n't
you
think
it
worth
your
while
to
count
'em
?
You
take
*NL*
money
like
a
lord
;
I
suppose
you
lose
it
like
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
I
was
not
to
look
a
gift-horse
in
the
mouth
,
sir
.
But
I
*NL*
shall
be
very
happy
to
count
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fred
was
not
so
happy
,
however
,
after
he
had
counted
them
.
For
they
*NL*
actually
presented
the
absurdity
of
being
less
than
his
hopefulness
had
*NL*
decided
that
they
must
be
.
What
can
the
fitness
of
things
mean
,
if
not
*NL*
their
fitness
to
a
man
's
expectations
?
Failing
this
,
absurdity
and
*NL*
atheism
gape
behind
him
.
The
collapse
for
Fred
was
severe
when
he
*NL*
found
that
he
held
no
more
than
five
twenties
,
and
his
share
in
the
*NL*
higher
education
of
this
country
did
not
seem
to
help
him
.
*NL*
Nevertheless
he
said
,
with
rapid
changes
in
his
fair
complexion
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
very
handsome
of
you
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
think
it
is
,
''
said
Mr.
Featherstone
,
locking
his
box
and
*NL*
replacing
it
,
then
taking
off
his
spectacles
deliberately
,
and
at
*NL*
length
,
as
if
his
inward
meditation
had
more
deeply
convinced
him
,
*NL*
repeating
,
``
I
should
think
it
handsome
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
assure
you
,
sir
,
I
am
very
grateful
,
''
said
Fred
,
who
had
had
time
to
*NL*
recover
his
cheerful
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
ought
to
be
.
You
want
to
cut
a
figure
in
the
world
,
and
I
*NL*
reckon
Peter
Featherstone
is
the
only
one
you
've
got
to
trust
to
.
''
Here
*NL*
the
old
man
's
eyes
gleamed
with
a
curiously
mingled
satisfaction
in
the
*NL*
consciousness
that
this
smart
young
fellow
relied
upon
him
,
and
that
*NL*
the
smart
young
fellow
was
rather
a
fool
for
doing
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
indeed
:
I
was
not
born
to
very
splendid
chances
.
Few
men
have
*NL*
been
more
cramped
than
I
have
been
,
''
said
Fred
,
with
some
sense
of
*NL*
surprise
at
his
own
virtue
,
considering
how
hardly
he
was
dealt
with
.
*NL*
``
It
really
seems
a
little
too
bad
to
have
to
ride
a
broken-winded
*NL*
hunter
,
and
see
men
,
who
,
are
not
half
such
good
judges
as
yourself
,
*NL*
able
to
throw
away
any
amount
of
money
on
buying
bad
bargains
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
can
buy
yourself
a
fine
hunter
now
.
Eighty
pound
is
enough
*NL*
for
that
,
I
reckon
--
and
you
'll
have
twenty
pound
over
to
get
yourself
*NL*
out
of
any
little
scrape
,
''
said
Mr.
Featherstone
,
chuckling
slightly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
very
good
,
sir
,
''
said
Fred
,
with
a
fine
sense
of
contrast
*NL*
between
the
words
and
his
feeling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
rather
a
better
uncle
than
your
fine
uncle
Bulstrode
.
You
wo
n't
*NL*
get
much
out
of
his
spekilations
,
I
think
.
He
's
got
a
pretty
strong
*NL*
string
round
your
father
's
leg
,
by
what
I
hear
,
eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
father
never
tells
me
anything
about
his
affairs
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
he
shows
some
sense
there
.
But
other
people
find
'em
out
*NL*
without
his
telling
.
_
He
'll
_
never
have
much
to
leave
you
:
he
'll
*NL*
most-like
die
without
a
will
--
he
's
the
sort
of
man
to
do
it
--
let
'em
*NL*
make
him
mayor
of
Middlemarch
as
much
as
they
like
.
But
you
wo
n't
get
*NL*
much
by
his
dying
without
a
will
,
though
you
_
are
_
the
eldest
son
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fred
thought
that
Mr.
Featherstone
had
never
been
so
disagreeable
*NL*
before
.
True
,
he
had
never
before
given
him
quite
so
much
money
at
*NL*
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
I
destroy
this
letter
of
Mr.
Bulstrode
's
,
sir
?
''
said
Fred
,
*NL*
rising
with
the
letter
as
if
he
would
put
it
in
the
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
ay
,
I
do
n't
want
it
.
It
's
worth
no
money
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fred
carried
the
letter
to
the
fire
,
and
thrust
the
poker
through
it
*NL*
with
much
zest
.
He
longed
to
get
out
of
the
room
,
but
he
was
a
little
*NL*
ashamed
before
his
inner
self
,
as
well
as
before
his
uncle
,
to
run
away
*NL*
immediately
after
pocketing
the
money
.
Presently
,
the
farm-bailiff
*NL*
came
up
to
give
his
master
a
report
,
and
Fred
,
to
his
unspeakable
*NL*
relief
,
was
dismissed
with
the
injunction
to
come
again
soon
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
longed
not
only
to
be
set
free
from
his
uncle
,
but
also
to
find
*NL*
Mary
Garth
.
She
was
now
in
her
usual
place
by
the
fire
,
with
sewing
in
*NL*
her
hands
and
a
book
open
on
the
little
table
by
her
side
.
Her
eyelids
*NL*
had
lost
some
of
their
redness
now
,
and
she
had
her
usual
air
of
*NL*
self-command
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Am
I
wanted
up-stairs
?
''
she
said
,
half
rising
as
Fred
entered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
I
am
only
dismissed
,
because
Simmons
is
gone
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
sat
down
again
,
and
resumed
her
work
.
She
was
certainly
treating
*NL*
him
with
more
indifference
than
usual
:
she
did
not
know
how
*NL*
affectionately
indignant
he
had
felt
on
her
behalf
up-stairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
I
stay
here
a
little
,
Mary
,
or
shall
I
bore
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pray
sit
down
,
''
said
Mary
;
``
you
will
not
be
so
heavy
a
bore
as
Mr.
*NL*
John
Waule
,
who
was
here
yesterday
,
and
he
sat
down
without
asking
my
*NL*
leave
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
fellow
!
I
think
he
is
in
love
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
aware
of
it
.
And
to
me
it
is
one
of
the
most
odious
things
*NL*
in
a
girl
's
life
,
that
there
must
always
be
some
supposition
of
falling
*NL*
in
love
coming
between
her
and
any
man
who
is
kind
to
her
,
and
to
whom
*NL*
she
is
grateful
.
I
should
have
thought
that
I
,
at
least
,
might
have
*NL*
been
safe
from
all
that
.
I
have
no
ground
for
the
nonsensical
vanity
*NL*
of
fancying
everybody
who
comes
near
me
is
in
love
with
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
did
not
mean
to
betray
any
feeling
,
but
in
spite
of
herself
she
*NL*
ended
in
a
tremulous
tone
of
vexation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Confound
John
Waule
!
I
did
not
mean
to
make
you
angry
.
I
did
n't
know
*NL*
you
had
any
reason
for
being
grateful
to
me
.
I
forgot
what
a
great
*NL*
service
you
think
it
if
any
one
snuffs
a
candle
for
you
.
''
Fred
also
had
*NL*
his
pride
,
and
was
not
going
to
show
that
he
knew
what
had
called
forth
*NL*
this
outburst
of
Mary
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
am
not
angry
,
except
with
the
ways
of
the
world

I
do
like
to
*NL*
be
spoken
to
as
if
I
had
common-sense
.
I
really
often
feel
as
if
I
*NL*
could
understand
a
little
more
than
I
ever
hear
even
from
young
*NL*
gentlemen
who
have
been
to
college
.
''
Mary
had
recovered
,
and
she
spoke
*NL*
with
a
suppressed
rippling
under-current
of
laughter
pleasant
to
hear
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
care
how
merry
you
are
at
my
expense
this
morning

''
said
Fred
,
*NL*
``
I
thought
you
looked
so
sad
when
you
came
up-stairs
.
It
is
a
shame
you
*NL*
should
stay
here
to
be
bullied
in
that
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
have
an
easy
life

by
comparison

I
have
tried
being
a
teacher

*NL*
and
I
am
not
fit
for
that
:
my
mind
is
too
fond
of
wandering
on
its
own
*NL*
way

I
think
any

is
better

pretending

do
what

paid
for

never
really
doing

Everything
here
I
can
do

perhaps
better

cried
Fred

in
a
tone
of
profound
brotherly
scepticism

``
Come

said
Mary

emphatically

laughing

*NL*
``
So

Fred
broke
off

stood
up

leaning
against
the

mantel-piece

*NL*
``
How

Mary

lifting
the
volume
on
the
table

``
However

naughty
you

Mary
was
sewing
swiftly
,
and
seemed
provokingly
*NL*
mistress
of
the
situation
.
When
a
conversation
has
taken
a
wrong
turn
*NL*
for
us
,
we
only
get
farther
and
farther
into
the
swamp

awkwardness

Fred

felt

strikes

said
Mary
,
the
corners
of
her
mouth
curling
archly
;
``
I
*NL*
must
go
back
on
my
experience
.
There
is
Juliet
--
she
seems
an
example
*NL*
of
what
you
say
.
But
then
Ophelia
had
probably
known
Hamlet
a
long
*NL*
while
;
and
Brenda
Troil
--
she
had
known
Mordaunt
Merton
ever
since
they
*NL*
were
children
;
but
then
he
seems
to
have
been
an
estimable
young
man
;
*NL*
and
Minna
was
still
more
deeply
in
love
with
Cleveland
,
who
was
a
*NL*
stranger
.
Waverley
was
new
to
Flora
MacIvor
;
but
then
she
did
not
fall
*NL*
in
love
with
him
.
And
there
are
Olivia
and
Sophia
Primrose
,
and
*NL*
Corinne
--
they
may
be
said
to
have
fallen
in
love
with
new
men
.
*NL*
Altogether
,
my
experience
is
rather
mixed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
looked
up
with
some
roguishness
at
Fred
,
and
that
look
of
hers
was
*NL*
very
dear
to
him
,
though
the
eyes
were
nothing
more
than
clear
windows
*NL*
where
observation
sat
laughingly
.
He
was
certainly
an
affectionate
*NL*
fellow
,
and
as
he
had
grown
from
boy
to
man
,
he
had
grown
in
love
with
*NL*
his
old
playmate
,
notwithstanding
that
share
in
the
higher
education
of
*NL*
the
country
which
had
exalted
his
views
of
rank
and
income
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
a
man
is
not
loved
,
it
is
no
use
for
him
to
say
that
he
could
be

a
better
fellow

could
do
anything

he
were

''
*NL*
*NL*
Fred
was
stung
,
and
released
her
hand
.
She
walked
to
the
door
,
but
*NL*
there
she
turned
and
said
:
``
Fred
,
you
have
always
been
so
good
,
so
*NL*
generous
to
me

I
am
not

never
speak
to

in
that
*NL*
way
again

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
''
said
Fred
,
sulkily
,
taking
up
his
hat
and
whip
.
His
*NL*
complexion
showed
patches
of
pale
pink
and
dead
white
.
Like
many
a
*NL*
plucked
idle
young
gentleman
,
he
was
thoroughly
in
love
,
and
with
a
*NL*
plain
girl
,
who
had
no
money
!
But
having
Mr.
Featherstone
's
land
in
*NL*
the
background
,
and
a
persuasion
that
,
let
Mary
say
what
she
would
,
she
*NL*
really
did
care
for
him
,
Fred
was
not
utterly
in
despair
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
got
home
,
he
gave
four
of
the
twenties
to
his
mother
,
asking
*NL*
her
to
keep
them
for
him
.
``
I
do
n't
want
to
spend
that
money
,
mother
.
*NL*
I
want
it
to
pay
a
debt
with

So
keep
it
safe
away
from
my
fingers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bless
you
,
my
dear

''
said
Mrs.
Vincy
.
She
doted
on
her
eldest
son
and
*NL*
her
youngest
girl
-LRB-
a
child
of
six
-RRB-
,
whom
others
thought
her
two
*NL*
naughtiest
children
.
The
mother
's
eyes
are
not
always
deceived
in
*NL*
their
partiality
:
she
at
least
can
best
judge
who
is
the
tender
,
*NL*
filial-hearted
child
.
And
Fred
was
certainly
very
fond
of
his
mother
.
*NL*
Perhaps
it
was
his
fondness
for
another
person
also
that
made
him
*NL*
particularly
anxious
to
take
some
security
against
his
own
liability
to
*NL*
spend
the
hundred
pounds
.
For
the
creditor
to
whom
he
owed
a
hundred
*NL*

sixty
held
a
firmer
security
in
the
shape
of
a
bill
signed
by

*NL*
A
great
historian
,
as
he
insisted
on
calling
himself
,
who
had
the
*NL*
happiness
to
be
dead
a
hundred
and
twenty
years
ago
,
and
so
to
take
his
*NL*
place
among
the
colossi
whose
huge
legs
our
living
pettiness
is
*NL*
observed
to
walk
under
,
glories
in
his
copious
remarks
and
digressions
*NL*
as
the
least
imitable
part
of
his
work
,
and
especially
in
those
initial
*NL*
chapters
to
the
successive
books
of
his
history
,
where
he
seems
to
*NL*
bring
his
armchair
to
the
proscenium
and
chat
with
us
in
all
the
lusty
*NL*
ease
of
his
fine
English
.
But
Fielding
lived
when
the
days
were
longer
*NL*
-LRB-
for
time
,
like
money
,
is
measured
by
our
needs
-RRB-
,
when
summer
*NL*
afternoons
were
spacious
,
and
the
clock
ticked
slowly
in
the
winter
*NL*
evenings
.
We
belated
historians
must
not
linger
after
his
example
;
and
*NL*
if
we
did
so
,
it
is
probable
that
our
chat
would
be
thin
and
eager
,
as
*NL*
if
delivered
from
a
campstool
in
a
parrot-house
.
I
at
least
have
so
*NL*
much
to
do
in
unraveling
certain
human
lots
,
and
seeing
how
they
were
*NL*
woven
and
interwoven
,
that
all
the
light
I
can
command
must
be
*NL*
concentrated
on
this
particular
web
,
and
not
dispersed
over
that
*NL*
tempting
range
of
relevancies
called
the
universe
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
present
I
have
to
make
the
new
settler
Lydgate
better
known
to
any
*NL*
one
interested
in
him
than
he
could
possibly
be
even
to
those
who
had
*NL*
seen
the
most
of
him
since
his
arrival
in
Middlemarch
.
For
surely
all
*NL*
must
admit
that
a
man
may
be
puffed
and
belauded
,
envied
,
ridiculed
,
*NL*
counted
upon
as
a
tool
and
fallen
in
love
with
,
or
at
least
selected
as
*NL*
a
future
husband
,
and
yet
remain
virtually
unknown
--
known
merely
as
a
*NL*
cluster
of
signs
for
his
neighbors
'
false
suppositions
.
There
was
a
*NL*
general
impression
,
however
,
that
Lydgate
was
not
altogether
a
common
*NL*
country
doctor
,
and
in
Middlemarch
at
that
time
such
an
impression
was
*NL*
significant
of
great
things
being
expected
from
him
.
For
everybody
's
*NL*
family
doctor
was
remarkably
clever
,
and
was
understood
to
have
*NL*
immeasurable
skill
in
the
management
and
training
of
the
most
skittish
*NL*
or
vicious
diseases
.
The
evidence
of
his
cleverness
was
of
the
higher
*NL*
intuitive
order
,
lying
in
his
lady-patients
'
immovable
conviction
,
and
*NL*
was
unassailable
by
any
objection
except
that
their
intuitions
were
*NL*
opposed
by
others
equally
strong
;
each
lady
who
saw
medical
truth
in
*NL*
Wrench
and
``
the
strengthening
treatment
''
regarding
Toller
and
``
the
*NL*
lowering
system
''
as
medical
perdition
.
For
the
heroic
times
of
copious
*NL*
bleeding
and
blistering
had
not
yet
departed
,
still
less
the
times
of
*NL*
thorough-going
theory
,
when
disease
in
general
was
called
by
some
bad
*NL*
name
,
and
treated
accordingly
without
shilly-shally
--
as
if
,
for
*NL*
example
,
it
were
to
be
called
insurrection
,
which
must
not
be
fired
on
*NL*
with
blank-cartridge
,
but
have
its
blood
drawn
at
once
.
The
*NL*
strengtheners
and
the
lowerers
were
all
``
clever
''
men
in
somebody
's
*NL*
opinion
,
which
is
really
as
much
as
can
be
said
for
any
living
talents
.
*NL*
Nobody
's
imagination
had
gone
so
far
as
to
conjecture
that
Mr.
Lydgate
*NL*
could
know
as
much
as
Dr.
Sprague
and
Dr.
Minchin
,
the
two
physicians
,
*NL*
who
alone
could
offer
any
hope
when
danger
was
extreme
,
and
when
the
*NL*
smallest
hope
was
worth
a
guinea
.
Still
,
I
repeat
,
there
was
a
general
*NL*
impression
that
Lydgate
was
something
rather
more
uncommon
than
any
*NL*
general
practitioner
in
Middlemarch
.
And
this
was
true
.
He
was
but
*NL*
seven-and-twenty
,
an
age
at
which
many
men
are
not
quite
common
--
at
*NL*
which
they
are
hopeful
of
achievement
,
resolute
in
avoidance
,
thinking
*NL*
that
Mammon
shall
never
put
a
bit
in
their
mouths
and
get
astride
their
*NL*
backs
,
but
rather
that
Mammon
,
if
they
have
anything
to
do
with
him
,
*NL*
shall
draw
their
chariot
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
been
left
an
orphan
when
he
was
fresh
from
a
public
school
.
His
*NL*
father
,
a
military
man
,
had
made
but
little
provision
for
three
*NL*
children
,
and
when
the
boy
Tertius
asked
to
have
a
medical
education
,
*NL*
it
seemed
easier
to
his
guardians
to
grant
his
request
by
apprenticing
*NL*
him
to
a
country
practitioner
than
to
make
any
objections
on
the
score
*NL*
of
family
dignity
.
He
was
one
of
the
rarer
lads
who
early
get
a
*NL*
decided
bent
and
make
up
their
minds
that
there
is
something
particular
*NL*
in
life
which
they
would
like
to
do
for
its
own
sake
,
and
not
because
*NL*
their
fathers
did
it
.
Most
of
us
who
turn
to
any
subject
with
love
*NL*
remember
some
morning
or
evening
hour
when
we
got
on
a
high
stool
to
*NL*
reach
down
an
untried
volume
,
or
sat
with
parted
lips
listening
to
a
*NL*
new
talker
,
or
for
very
lack
of
books
began
to
listen
to
the
voices
*NL*
within
,
as
the
first
traceable
beginning
of
our
love
.
Something
of
*NL*
that
sort
happened
to
Lydgate
.
He
was
a
quick
fellow
,
and
when
hot
*NL*
from
play
,
would
toss
himself
in
a
corner
,
and
in
five
minutes
be
deep
*NL*
in
any
sort
of
book
that
he
could
lay
his
hands
on
:
if
it
were
Rasselas
*NL*
or
Gulliver
,
so
much
the
better
,
but
Bailey
's
Dictionary
would
do
,
or
*NL*
the
Bible
with
the
Apocrypha
in
it
.
Something
he
must
read
,
when
he
*NL*
was
not
riding
the
pony
,
or
running
and
hunting
,
or
listening
to
the
*NL*
talk
of
men
.
All
this
was
true
of
him
at
ten
years
of
age
;
he
had
then
*NL*
read
through
``
Chrysal
,
or
the
Adventures
of
a
Guinea
,
''
which
was
*NL*
neither
milk
for
babes
,
nor
any
chalky
mixture
meant
to
pass
for
milk
,
*NL*
and
it
had
already
occurred
to
him
that
books
were
stuff
,
and
that
life
*NL*
was
stupid
.
His
school
studies
had
not
much
modified
that
opinion
,
for
*NL*
though
he
``
did
''
his
classics
and
mathematics
,
he
was
not
pre-eminent
in
*NL*
them
.
It
was
said
of
him
,
that
Lydgate
could
do
anything
he
liked
,
but
*NL*
he
had
certainly
not
yet
liked
to
do
anything
remarkable
.
He
was
a
*NL*
vigorous
animal
with
a
ready
understanding
,
but
no
spark
had
yet
*NL*
kindled
in
him
an
intellectual
passion
;
knowledge
seemed
to
him
a
very
*NL*
superficial
affair
,
easily
mastered
:
judging
from
the
conversation
of
*NL*
his
elders
,
he
had
apparently
got
already
more
than
was
necessary
for
*NL*
mature
life
.
Probably
this
was
not
an
exceptional
result
of
expensive
*NL*
teaching
at
that
period
of
short-waisted
coats
,
and
other
fashions
*NL*
which
have
not
yet
recurred
.
But
,
one
vacation
,
a
wet
day
sent
him
to
*NL*
the
small
home
library
to
hunt
once
more
for
a
book
which
might
have
*NL*
some
freshness
for
him
:
in
vain
!
unless
,
indeed
,
he
took
down
a
dusty
*NL*
row
of
volumes
with
gray-paper
backs
and
dingy
labels
--
the
volumes
of
*NL*
an
old
Cyclopaedia
which
he
had
never
disturbed
.
It
would
at
least
be
*NL*
a
novelty
to
disturb
them
.
They
were
on
the
highest
shelf
,
and
he
*NL*
stood
on
a
chair
to
get
them
down
.
But
he
opened
the
volume
which
he
*NL*
first
took
from
the
shelf
:
somehow
,
one
is
apt
to
read
in
a
makeshift
*NL*
attitude
,
just
where
it
might
seem
inconvenient
to
do
so
.
The
page
he
*NL*
opened
on
was
under
the
head
of
Anatomy
,
and
the
first
passage
that
*NL*
drew
his
eyes
was
on
the
valves
of
the
heart
.
He
was
not
much
*NL*
acquainted
with
valves
of
any
sort
,
but
he
knew
that
valvae
were
*NL*
folding-doors
,
and
through
this
crevice
came
a
sudden
light
startling
*NL*
him
with
his
first
vivid
notion
of
finely
adjusted
mechanism
in
the
*NL*
human
frame
.
A
liberal
education
had
of
course
left
him
free
to
read
*NL*
the
indecent
passages
in
the
school
classics
,
but
beyond
a
general
*NL*
sense
of
secrecy
and
obscenity
in
connection
with
his
internal
*NL*
structure
,
had
left
his
imagination
quite
unbiassed
,
so
that
for
*NL*
anything
he
knew
his
brains
lay
in
small
bags
at
his
temples
,
and
he
*NL*
had
no
more
thought
of
representing
to
himself
how
his
blood
circulated
*NL*
than
how
paper
served
instead
of
gold
.
But
the
moment
of
vocation
had
*NL*
come
,
and
before
he
got
down
from
his
chair
,
the
world
was
made
new
to
*NL*
him
by
a
presentiment
of
endless
processes
filling
the
vast
spaces
*NL*
planked
out
of
his
sight
by
that
wordy
ignorance
which
he
had
supposed
*NL*
to
be
knowledge
.
From
that
hour
Lydgate
felt
the
growth
of
an
*NL*
intellectual
passion
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
are
not
afraid
of
telling
over
and
over
again
how
a
man
comes
to
*NL*
fall
in
love
with
a
woman
and
be
wedded
to
her
,
or
else
be
fatally
*NL*
parted
from
her
.
Is
it
due
to
excess
of
poetry
or
of
stupidity
that
we
*NL*
are
never
weary
of
describing
what
King
James
called
a
woman
's
``
makdom
*NL*
and
her
fairnesse
,
''
never
weary
of
listening
to
the
twanging
of
the
old
*NL*
Troubadour
strings
,
and
are
comparatively
uninterested
in
that
other
*NL*
kind
of
``
makdom
and
fairnesse
''
which
must
be
wooed
with
industrious
*NL*
thought
and
patient
renunciation
of
small
desires
?
In
the
story
of
*NL*
this
passion
,
too
,
the
development
varies
:
sometimes
it
is
the
glorious
*NL*
marriage
,
sometimes
frustration
and
final
parting
.
And
not
seldom
the
*NL*
catastrophe
is
bound
up
with
the
other
passion
,
sung
by
the
*NL*
Troubadours
.
For
in
the
multitude
of
middle-aged
men
who
go
about
*NL*
their
vocations
in
a
daily
course
determined
for
them
much
in
the
same
*NL*
way
as
the
tie
of
their
cravats
,
there
is
always
a
good
number
who
once
*NL*
meant
to
shape
their
own
deeds
and
alter
the
world
a
little
.
The
story
*NL*
of
their
coming
to
be
shapen
after
the
average
and
fit
to
be
packed
by
*NL*
the
gross
,
is
hardly
ever
told
even
in
their
consciousness
;
for
perhaps
*NL*
their
ardor
in
generous
unpaid
toil
cooled
as
imperceptibly
as
the
*NL*
ardor
of
other
youthful
loves
,
till
one
day
their
earlier
self
walked
*NL*
like
a
ghost
in
its
old
home
and
made
the
new
furniture
ghastly
.
*NL*
Nothing
in
the
world
more
subtle
than
the
process
of
their
gradual
*NL*
change
!
In
the
beginning
they
inhaled
it
unknowingly
:
you
and
I
may
*NL*
have
sent
some
of
our
breath
towards
infecting
them
,
when
we
uttered
*NL*
our
conforming
falsities
or
drew
our
silly
conclusions
:
or
perhaps
it
*NL*
came
with
the
vibrations
from
a
woman
's
glance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lydgate
did
not
mean
to
be
one
of
those
failures
,
and
there
was
the
*NL*
better
hope
of
him
because
his
scientific
interest
soon
took
the
form
*NL*
of
a
professional
enthusiasm
:
he
had
a
youthful
belief
in
his
*NL*
bread-winning
work
,
not
to
be
stifled
by
that
initiation
in
makeshift
*NL*
called
his
`
prentice
days
;
and
he
carried
to
his
studies
in
London
,
*NL*
Edinburgh
,
and
Paris
,
the
conviction
that
the
medical
profession
as
it
*NL*
might
be
was
the
finest
in
the
world
;
presenting
the
most
perfect
*NL*
interchange
between
science
and
art
;
offering
the
most
direct
alliance
*NL*
between
intellectual
conquest
and
the
social
good
.
Lydgate
's
nature
*NL*
demanded
this
combination
:
he
was
an
emotional
creature
,
with
a
*NL*
flesh-and-blood
sense
of
fellowship
which
withstood
all
the
*NL*
abstractions
of
special
study
.
He
cared
not
only
for
``
cases
,
''
but
for
*NL*
John
and
Elizabeth
,
especially
Elizabeth
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
another
attraction
in
his
profession
:
it
wanted
reform
,
and
*NL*
gave
a
man
an
opportunity
for
some
indignant
resolve
to
reject
its
*NL*
venal
decorations
and
other
humbug
,
and
to
be
the
possessor
of
genuine
*NL*
though
undemanded
qualifications
.
He
went
to
study
in
Paris
with
the
*NL*
determination
that
when
he
came
home
again
he
would
settle
in
some
*NL*
provincial
town
as
a
general
practitioner
,
and
resist
the
*NL*
irrational
severance
between
medical
and
surgical
knowledge
in
the
*NL*
interest
of
his
own
scientific
pursuits
,
as
well
as
of
the
general
*NL*
advance
:
he
would
keep
away
from
the
range
of
London
intrigues
,
*NL*
jealousies
,
and
social
truckling
,
and
win
celebrity
,
however
slowly
,
as
*NL*
Jenner
had
done
,
by
the
independent
value
of
his
work
.
For
it
must
be
*NL*
remembered
that
this
was
a
dark
period
;
and
in
spite
of
venerable
*NL*
colleges
which
used
great
efforts
to
secure
purity
of
knowledge
by
*NL*
making
it
scarce
,
and
to
exclude
error
by
a
rigid
exclusiveness
in
*NL*
relation
to
fees
and
appointments
,
it
happened
that
very
ignorant
young
*NL*
gentlemen
were
promoted
in
town
,
and
many
more
got
a
legal
right
to
*NL*
practise
over
large
areas
in
the
country
.
Also
,
the
high
standard
held
*NL*
up
to
the
public
mind
by
the
College
of
Physicians
,
which
gave
its
peculiar
*NL*
sanction
to
the
expensive
and
highly
rarefied
medical
instruction
*NL*
obtained
by
graduates
of
Oxford
and
Cambridge
,
did
not
hinder
quackery
*NL*
from
having
an
excellent
time
of
it
;
for
since
professional
practice
*NL*
chiefly
consisted
in
giving
a
great
many
drugs
,
the
public
inferred
*NL*
that
it
might
be
better
off
with
more
drugs
still
,
if
they
could
only
*NL*
be
got
cheaply
,
and
hence
swallowed
large
cubic
measures
of
physic
*NL*
prescribed
by
unscrupulous
ignorance
which
had
taken
no
degrees
.
*NL*
Considering
that
statistics
had
not
yet
embraced
a
calculation
as
to
*NL*
the
number
of
ignorant
or
canting
doctors
which
absolutely
must
exist
*NL*
in
the
teeth
of
all
changes
,
it
seemed
to
Lydgate
that
a
change
in
the
*NL*
units
was
the
most
direct
mode
of
changing
the
numbers
.
He
meant
to
be
*NL*
a
unit
who
would
make
a
certain
amount
of
difference
towards
that
*NL*
spreading
change
which
would
one
day
tell
appreciably
upon
the
*NL*
averages
,
and
in
the
mean
time
have
the
pleasure
of
making
an
*NL*
advantageous
difference
to
the
viscera
of
his
own
patients
.
But
he
did
*NL*
not
simply
aim
at
a
more
genuine
kind
of
practice
than
was
common
.
He
*NL*
was
ambitious
of
a
wider
effect
:
he
was
fired
with
the
possibility
that
*NL*
he
might
work
out
the
proof
of
an
anatomical
conception
and
make
a
link
*NL*
in
the
chain
of
discovery
.
*NL*
*NL*
Does
it
seem
incongruous
to
you
that
a
Middlemarch
surgeon
should
dream
*NL*
of
himself
as
a
discoverer
?
Most
of
us
,
indeed
,
know
little
of
the
*NL*
great
originators
until
they
have
been
lifted
up
among
the
*NL*
constellations
and
already
rule
our
fates
.
But
that
Herschel
,
for
*NL*
example
,
who
``
broke
the
barriers
of
the
heavens
''
--
did
he
not
once
play
*NL*
a
provincial
church-organ
,
and
give
music-lessons
to
stumbling
*NL*
pianists
?
Each
of
those
Shining
Ones
had
to
walk
on
the
earth
among
*NL*
neighbors
who
perhaps
thought
much
more
of
his
gait
and
his
garments
*NL*
than
of
anything
which
was
to
give
him
a
title
to
everlasting
fame
:
*NL*
each
of
them
had
his
little
local
personal
history
sprinkled
with
small
*NL*
temptations
and
sordid
cares
,
which
made
the
retarding
friction
of
his
*NL*
course
towards
final
companionship
with
the
immortals
.
Lydgate
was
not
*NL*
blind
to
the
dangers
of
such
friction
,
but
he
had
plenty
of
confidence
*NL*
in
his
resolution
to
avoid
it
as
far
as
possible
:
being
*NL*
seven-and-twenty
,
he
felt
himself
experienced
.
And
he
was
not
going
to
*NL*
have
his
vanities
provoked
by
contact
with
the
showy
worldly
successes
*NL*
of
the
capital
,
but
to
live
among
people
who
could
hold
no
rivalry
with
*NL*
that
pursuit
of
a
great
idea
which
was
to
be
a
twin
object
with
the
*NL*
assiduous
practice
of
his
profession
.
There
was
fascination
in
the
*NL*
hope
that
the
two
purposes
would
illuminate
each
other
:
the
careful
*NL*
observation
and
inference
which
was
his
daily
work
,
the
use
of
the
lens
*NL*
to
further
his
judgment
in
special
cases
,
would
further
his
thought
as
*NL*
an
instrument
of
larger
inquiry
.
Was
not
this
the
typical
pre-eminence
*NL*
of
his
profession
?
He
would
be
a
good
Middlemarch
doctor
,
and
by
that
*NL*
very
means
keep
himself
in
the
track
of
far-reaching
investigation
.
On
*NL*
one
point
he
may
fairly
claim
approval
at
this
particular
stage
of
his
*NL*
career
:
he
did
not
mean
to
imitate
those
philanthropic
models
who
make
*NL*
a
profit
out
of
poisonous
pickles
to
support
themselves
while
they
are
*NL*
exposing
adulteration
,
or
hold
shares
in
a
gambling-hell
that
they
may
*NL*
have
leisure
to
represent
the
cause
of
public
morality
.
He
intended
to
*NL*
begin
in
his
own
case
some
particular
reforms
which
were
quite
*NL*
certainly
within
his
reach
,
and
much
less
of
a
problem
than
the
*NL*
demonstrating
of
an
anatomical
conception
.
One
of
these
reforms
was
to
*NL*
act
stoutly
on
the
strength
of
a
recent
legal
decision
,
and
simply
*NL*
prescribe
,
without
dispensing
drugs
or
taking
percentage
from
*NL*
druggists
.
This
was
an
innovation
for
one
who
had
chosen
to
adopt
the
*NL*
style
of
general
practitioner
in
a
country
town
,
and
would
be
felt
as
*NL*
offensive
criticism
by
his
professional
brethren
.
But
Lydgate
meant
to
*NL*
innovate
in
his
treatment
also
,
and
he
was
wise
enough
to
see
that
the
*NL*
best
security
for
his
practising
honestly
according
to
his
belief
was
*NL*
to
get
rid
of
systematic
temptations
to
the
contrary
.
*NL*
*NL*
Perhaps
that
was
a
more
cheerful
time
for
observers
and
theorizers
than
*NL*
the
present
;
we
are
apt
to
think
it
the
finest
era
of
the
world
when
*NL*
America
was
beginning
to
be
discovered
,
when
a
bold
sailor
,
even
if
he
*NL*
were
wrecked
,
might
alight
on
a
new
kingdom
;
and
about
1829
the
dark
*NL*
territories
of
Pathology
were
a
fine
America
for
a
spirited
young
*NL*
adventurer
.
Lydgate
was
ambitious
above
all
to
contribute
towards
*NL*
enlarging
the
scientific
,
rational
basis
of
his
profession
.
The
more
*NL*
he
became
interested
in
special
questions
of
disease
,
such
as
the
*NL*
nature
of
fever
or
fevers
,
the
more
keenly
he
felt
the
need
for
that
*NL*
fundamental
knowledge
of
structure
which
just
at
the
beginning
of
the
*NL*
century
had
been
illuminated
by
the
brief
and
glorious
career
of
*NL*
Bichat
,
who
died
when
he
was
only
one-and-thirty
,
but
,
like
another
*NL*
Alexander
,
left
a
realm
large
enough
for
many
heirs
.
That
great
*NL*
Frenchman
first
carried
out
the
conception
that
living
bodies
,
*NL*
fundamentally
considered
,
are
not
associations
of
organs
which
can
be
*NL*
understood
by
studying
them
first
apart
,
and
then
as
it
were
federally
;
*NL*
but
must
be
regarded
as
consisting
of
certain
primary
webs
or
tissues
,
*NL*
out
of
which
the
various
organs
--
brain
,
heart
,
lungs
,
and
so
on
--
are
*NL*
compacted
,
as
the
various
accommodations
of
a
house
are
built
up
in
*NL*
various
proportions
of
wood
,
iron
,
stone
,
brick
,
zinc
,
and
the
rest
,
*NL*
each
material
having
its
peculiar
composition
and
proportions
.
No
man
,
*NL*
one
sees
,
can
understand
and
estimate
the
entire
structure
or
its
*NL*
parts
--
what
are
its
frailties
and
what
its
repairs
,
without
knowing
the
*NL*
nature
of
the
materials
.
And
the
conception
wrought
out
by
Bichat
,
*NL*
with
his
detailed
study
of
the
different
tissues
,
acted
necessarily
on
*NL*
medical
questions
as
the
turning
of
gas-light
would
act
on
a
dim
,
*NL*
oil-lit
street
,
showing
new
connections
and
hitherto
hidden
facts
of
*NL*
structure
which
must
be
taken
into
account
in
considering
the
symptoms
*NL*
of
maladies
and
the
action
of
medicaments
.
But
results
which
depend
on
*NL*
human
conscience
and
intelligence
work
slowly
,
and
now
at
the
end
of
*NL*
1829
,
most
medical
practice
was
still
strutting
or
shambling
along
the
*NL*
old
paths
,
and
there
was
still
scientific
work
to
be
done
which
might
*NL*
have
seemed
to
be
a
direct
sequence
of
Bichat
's
.
This
great
seer
did
*NL*
not
go
beyond
the
consideration
of
the
tissues
as
ultimate
facts
in
the
*NL*
living
organism
,
marking
the
limit
of
anatomical
analysis
;
but
it
was
*NL*
open
to
another
mind
to
say
,
have
not
these
structures
some
common
*NL*
basis
from
which
they
have
all
started
,
as
your
sarsnet
,
gauze
,
net
,
*NL*
satin
,
and
velvet
from
the
raw
cocoon
?
Here
would
be
another
light
,
as
*NL*
of
oxy-hydrogen
,
showing
the
very
grain
of
things
,
and
revising
all
*NL*
former
explanations
.
Of
this
sequence
to
Bichat
's
work
,
already
*NL*
vibrating
along
many
currents
of
the
European
mind
,
Lydgate
was
*NL*
enamoured
;
he
longed
to
demonstrate
the
more
intimate
relations
of
*NL*
living
structure
,
and
help
to
define
men
's
thought
more
accurately
*NL*
after
the
true
order
.
The
work
had
not
yet
been
done
,
but
only
*NL*
prepared
for
those
who
knew
how
to
use
the
preparation
.
What
was
the
*NL*
primitive
tissue
?
In
that
way
Lydgate
put
the
question
--
not
quite
in
*NL*
the
way
required
by
the
awaiting
answer
;
but
such
missing
of
the
right
*NL*
word
befalls
many
seekers
.
And
he
counted
on
quiet
intervals
to
be
*NL*
watchfully
seized
,
for
taking
up
the
threads
of
investigation
--
on
many
*NL*
hints
to
be
won
from
diligent
application
,
not
only
of
the
scalpel
,
but
*NL*
of
the
microscope
,
which
research
had
begun
to
use
again
with
new
*NL*
enthusiasm
of
reliance
.
Such
was
Lydgate
's
plan
of
his
future
:
to
do
*NL*
good
small
work
for
Middlemarch
,
and
great
work
for
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
certainly
a
happy
fellow
at
this
time
:
to
be
seven-and-twenty
,
*NL*
without
any
fixed
vices
,
with
a
generous
resolution
that
his
action
*NL*
should
be
beneficent
,
and
with
ideas
in
his
brain
that
made
life
*NL*
interesting
quite
apart
from
the
cultus
of
horseflesh
and
other
mystic
*NL*
rites
of
costly
observance
,
which
the
eight
hundred
pounds
left
him
*NL*
after
buying
his
practice
would
certainly
not
have
gone
far
in
paying
*NL*
for
.
He
was
at
a
starting-point
which
makes
many
a
man
's
career
a
fine
*NL*
subject
for
betting
,
if
there
were
any
gentlemen
given
to
that
*NL*
amusement
who
could
appreciate
the
complicated
probabilities
of
an
*NL*
arduous
purpose
,
with
all
the
possible
thwartings
and
furtherings
of
*NL*
circumstance
,
all
the
niceties
of
inward
balance
,
by
which
a
man
swims
*NL*
and
makes
his
point
or
else
is
carried
headlong
.
The
risk
would
remain
*NL*
even
with
close
knowledge
of
Lydgate
's
character
;
for
character
too
is
*NL*
a
process
and
an
unfolding
.
The
man
was
still
in
the
making
,
as
much
*NL*
as
the
Middlemarch
doctor
and
immortal
discoverer
,
and
there
were
both
*NL*
virtues
and
faults
capable
of
shrinking
or
expanding
.
The
faults
will
*NL*
not
,
I
hope
,
be
a
reason
for
the
withdrawal
of
your
interest
in
him
.
*NL*
Among
our
valued
friends
is
there
not
some
one
or
other
who
is
a
little
*NL*
too
self-confident
and
disdainful
;
whose
distinguished
mind
is
a
little
*NL*
spotted
with
commonness
;
who
is
a
little
pinched
here
and
protuberant
*NL*
there
with
native
prejudices
;
or
whose
better
energies
are
liable
to
*NL*
lapse
down
the
wrong
channel
under
the
influence
of
transient
*NL*
solicitations
?
All
these
things
might
be
alleged
against
Lydgate
,
but
*NL*
then
,
they
are
the
periphrases
of
a
polite
preacher
,
who
talks
of
Adam
,
*NL*
and
would
not
like
to
mention
anything
painful
to
the
pew-renters
.
The
*NL*
particular
faults
from
which
these
delicate
generalities
are
distilled
*NL*
have
distinguishable
physiognomies
,
diction
,
accent
,
and
grimaces
;
*NL*
filling
up
parts
in
very
various
dramas
.
Our
vanities
differ
as
our
*NL*
noses
do
:
all
conceit
is
not
the
same
conceit
,
but
varies
in
*NL*
correspondence
with
the
minutiae
of
mental
make
in
which
one
of
us
*NL*
differs
from
another
.
Lydgate
's
conceit
was
of
the
arrogant
sort
,
*NL*
never
simpering
,
never
impertinent
,
but
massive
in
its
claims
and
*NL*
benevolently
contemptuous
.
He
would
do
a
great
deal
for
noodles
,
being
*NL*
sorry
for
them
,
and
feeling
quite
sure
that
they
could
have
no
power
*NL*
over
him
:
he
had
thought
of
joining
the
Saint
Simonians
when
he
was
in
*NL*
Paris
,
in
order
to
turn
them
against
some
of
their
own
doctrines
.
All
*NL*
his
faults
were
marked
by
kindred
traits
,
and
were
those
of
a
man
who
*NL*
had
a
fine
baritone
,
whose
clothes
hung
well
upon
him
,
and
who
even
in
*NL*
his
ordinary
gestures
had
an
air
of
inbred
distinction
.
Where
then
lay
*NL*
the
spots
of
commonness
?
says
a
young
lady
enamoured
of
that
careless
*NL*
grace
.
How
could
there
be
any
commonness
in
a
man
so
well-bred
,
so
*NL*
ambitious
of
social
distinction
,
so
generous
and
unusual
in
his
views
*NL*
of
social
duty
?
As
easily
as
there
may
be
stupidity
in
a
man
of
genius
*NL*
if
you
take
him
unawares
on
the
wrong
subject
,
or
as
many
a
man
who
has
*NL*
the
best
will
to
advance
the
social
millennium
might
be
ill-inspired
in
*NL*
imagining
its
lighter
pleasures
;
unable
to
go
beyond
Offenbach
's
music
,
*NL*
or
the
brilliant
punning
in
the
last
burlesque
.
Lydgate
's
spots
of
*NL*
commonness
lay
in
the
complexion
of
his
prejudices
,
which
,
in
spite
of
*NL*
noble
intention
and
sympathy
,
were
half
of
them
such
as
are
found
in
*NL*
ordinary
men
of
the
world
:
that
distinction
of
mind
which
belonged
to
*NL*
his
intellectual
ardor
,
did
not
penetrate
his
feeling
and
judgment
*NL*
about
furniture
,
or
women
,
or
the
desirability
of
its
being
known
*NL*
-LRB-
without
his
telling
-RRB-
that
he
was
better
born
than
other
country
*NL*
surgeons
.
He
did
not
mean
to
think
of
furniture
at
present
;
but
*NL*
whenever
he
did
so
it
was
to
be
feared
that
neither
biology
nor
schemes
*NL*
of
reform
would
lift
him
above
the
vulgarity
of
feeling
that
there
*NL*
would
be
an
incompatibility
in
his
furniture
not
being
of
the
best
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
to
women
,
he
had
once
already
been
drawn
headlong
by
impetuous
*NL*
folly
,
which
he
meant
to
be
final
,
since
marriage
at
some
distant
*NL*
period
would
of
course
not
be
impetuous
.
For
those
who
want
to
be
*NL*
acquainted
with
Lydgate
it
will
be
good
to
know
what
was
that
case
of
*NL*
impetuous
folly
,
for
it
may
stand
as
an
example
of
the
fitful
swerving
*NL*
of
passion
to
which
he
was
prone
,
together
with
the
chivalrous
kindness
*NL*
which
helped
to
make
him
morally
lovable
.
The
story
can
be
told
*NL*
without
many
words
.
It
happened
when
he
was
studying
in
Paris
,
and
*NL*
just
at
the
time
when
,
over
and
above
his
other
work
,
he
was
occupied
*NL*
with
some
galvanic
experiments
.
One
evening
,
tired
with
his
*NL*
experimenting
,
and
not
being
able
to
elicit
the
facts
he
needed
,
he
*NL*
left
his
frogs
and
rabbits
to
some
repose
under
their
trying
and
*NL*
mysterious
dispensation
of
unexplained
shocks
,
and
went
to
finish
his
*NL*
evening
at
the
theatre
of
the
Porte
Saint
Martin
,
where
there
was
a
*NL*
melodrama
which
he
had
already
seen
several
times
;
attracted
,
not
by
*NL*
the
ingenious
work
of
the
collaborating
authors
,
but
by
an
actress
*NL*
whose
part
it
was
to
stab
her
lover
,
mistaking
him
for
the
*NL*
evil-designing
duke
of
the
piece
.
Lydgate
was
in
love
with
this
*NL*
actress
,
as
a
man
is
in
love
with
a
woman
whom
he
never
expects
to
*NL*
speak
to
.
She
was
a
Provencale
,
with
dark
eyes
,
a
Greek
profile
,
and
*NL*
rounded
majestic
form
,
having
that
sort
of
beauty
which
carries
a
sweet
*NL*
matronliness
even
in
youth
,
and
her
voice
was
a
soft
cooing
.
She
had
*NL*
but
lately
come
to
Paris
,
and
bore
a
virtuous
reputation
,
her
husband
*NL*
acting
with
her
as
the
unfortunate
lover
.
It
was
her
acting
which
was
*NL*
``
no
better
than
it
should
be
,
''
but
the
public
was
satisfied
.
Lydgate
's
*NL*
only
relaxation
now
was
to
go
and
look
at
this
woman
,
just
as
he
might
*NL*
have
thrown
himself
under
the
breath
of
the
sweet
south
on
a
bank
of
*NL*
violets
for
a
while
,
without
prejudice
to
his
galvanism
,
to
which
he
*NL*
would
presently
return
.
But
this
evening
the
old
drama
had
a
new
*NL*
catastrophe
.
At
the
moment
when
the
heroine
was
to
act
the
stabbing
of
*NL*
her
lover
,
and
he
was
to
fall
gracefully
,
the
wife
veritably
stabbed
*NL*
her
husband
,
who
fell
as
death
willed
.
A
wild
shriek
pierced
the
*NL*
house
,
and
the
Provencale
fell
swooning
:
a
shriek
and
a
swoon
were
*NL*
demanded
by
the
play
,
but
the
swooning
too
was
real
this
time
.
Lydgate
*NL*
leaped
and
climbed
,
he
hardly
knew
how
,
on
to
the
stage
,
and
was
active
*NL*
in
help
,
making
the
acquaintance
of
his
heroine
by
finding
a
contusion
*NL*
on
her
head
and
lifting
her
gently
in
his
arms
.
Paris
rang
with
the
*NL*
story
of
this
death
:
--
was
it
a
murder
?
Some
of
the
actress
's
warmest
*NL*
admirers
were
inclined
to
believe
in
her
guilt
,
and
liked
her
the
*NL*
better
for
it
-LRB-
such
was
the
taste
of
those
times
-RRB-
;
but
Lydgate
was
not
*NL*
one
of
these
.
He
vehemently
contended
for
her
innocence
,
and
the
*NL*
remote
impersonal
passion
for
her
beauty
which
he
had
felt
before
,
had
*NL*
passed
now
into
personal
devotion
,
and
tender
thought
of
her
lot
.
The
*NL*
notion
of
murder
was
absurd
:
no
motive
was
discoverable
,
the
young
*NL*
couple
being
understood
to
dote
on
each
other
;
and
it
was
not
*NL*
unprecedented
that
an
accidental
slip
of
the
foot
should
have
brought
*NL*
these
grave
consequences
.
The
legal
investigation
ended
in
Madame
*NL*
Laure
's
release
.
Lydgate
by
this
time
had
had
many
interviews
with
*NL*
her
,
and
found
her
more
and
more
adorable
.
She
talked
little
;
but
that
*NL*
was
an
additional
charm
.
She
was
melancholy
,
and
seemed
grateful
;
her
*NL*
presence
was
enough
,
like
that
of
the
evening
light
.
Lydgate
was
madly
*NL*
anxious
about
her
affection
,
and
jealous
lest
any
other
man
than
*NL*
himself
should
win
it
and
ask
her
to
marry
him
.
But
instead
of
*NL*
reopening
her
engagement
at
the
Porte
Saint
Martin
,
where
she
would
*NL*
have
been
all
the
more
popular
for
the
fatal
episode
,
she
left
Paris
*NL*
without
warning
,
forsaking
her
little
court
of
admirers
.
Perhaps
no
*NL*
one
carried
inquiry
far
except
Lydgate
,
who
felt
that
all
science
had
*NL*
come
to
a
stand-still
while
he
imagined
the
unhappy
Laure
,
stricken
by
*NL*
ever-wandering
sorrow
,
herself
wandering
,
and
finding
no
faithful
*NL*
comforter
.
Hidden
actresses
,
however
,
are
not
so
difficult
to
find
as
*NL*
some
other
hidden
facts
,
and
it
was
not
long
before
Lydgate
gathered
*NL*
indications
that
Laure
had
taken
the
route
to
Lyons
.
He
found
her
at
*NL*
last
acting
with
great
success
at
Avignon
under
the
same
name
,
looking
*NL*
more
majestic
than
ever
as
a
forsaken
wife
carrying
her
child
in
her
*NL*
arms
.
He
spoke
to
her
after
the
play
,
was
received
with
the
usual
*NL*
quietude
which
seemed
to
him
beautiful
as
clear
depths
of
water
,
and
*NL*
obtained
leave
to
visit
her
the
next
day
;
when
he
was
bent
on
telling
*NL*
her
that
he
adored
her
,
and
on
asking
her
to
marry
him
.
He
knew
that
*NL*
this
was
like
the
sudden
impulse
of
a
madman
--
incongruous
even
with
his
*NL*
habitual
foibles
.
No
matter
!
It
was
the
one
thing
which
he
was
*NL*
resolved
to
do
.
He
had
two
selves
within
him
apparently
,
and
they
must
*NL*
learn
to
accommodate
each
other
and
bear
reciprocal
impediments
.
*NL*
Strange
,
that
some
of
us
,
with
quick
alternate
vision
,
see
beyond
our
*NL*
infatuations
,
and
even
while
we
rave
on
the
heights
,
behold
the
wide
*NL*
plain
where
our
persistent
self
pauses
and
awaits
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
have
approached
Laure
with
any
suit
that
was
not
reverentially
*NL*
tender
would
have
been
simply
a
contradiction
of
his
whole
feeling
*NL*
towards
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
come
all
the
way
from
Paris
to
find
me
?
''
she
said
to
him
the
*NL*
next
day
,
sitting
before
him
with
folded
arms
,
and
looking
at
him
with
*NL*
eyes
that
seemed
to
wonder
as
an
untamed
ruminating
animal
wonders
.
*NL*
``
Are
all
Englishmen
like
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
came
because
I
could
not
live
without
trying
to
see
you
.
You
are
*NL*
lonely
;
I
love
you
;
I
want
you
to
consent
to
be
my
wife
;
I
will
wait
,
*NL*
but
I
want
you
to
promise
that
you
will
marry
me
--
no
one
else
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Laure
looked
at
him
in
silence
with
a
melancholy
radiance
from
under
*NL*
her
grand
eyelids
,
until
he
was
full
of
rapturous
certainty
,
and
knelt
*NL*
close
to
her
knees
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
tell
you
something
,
''
she
said
,
in
her
cooing
way
,
keeping
her
*NL*
arms
folded
.
``
My
foot
really
slipped
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
,
I
know
,
''
said
Lydgate
,
deprecatingly
.
``
It
was
a
fatal
*NL*
accident
--
a
dreadful
stroke
of
calamity
that
bound
me
to
you
the
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
Laure
paused
a
little
and
then
said
,
slowly
,
''
_
I
meant
to
do
it
.
_
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lydgate
,
strong
man
as
he
was
,
turned
pale
and
trembled
:
moments
seemed
*NL*
to
pass
before
he
rose
and
stood
at
a
distance
from
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
was
a
secret
,
then
,
''
he
said
at
last
,
even
vehemently
.
``
He
was
*NL*
brutal
to
you
:
you
hated
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
!
he
wearied
me
;
he
was
too
fond
:
he
would
live
in
Paris
,
and
not
in
*NL*
my
country
;
that
was
not
agreeable
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Great
God
!
''
said
Lydgate
,
in
a
groan
of
horror
.
``
And
you
planned
to
*NL*
murder
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
not
plan
:
it
came
to
me
in
the
play
--
_
I
meant
to
do
it
.
_
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lydgate
stood
mute
,
and
unconsciously
pressed
his
hat
on
while
he
*NL*
looked
at
her
.
He
saw
this
woman
--
the
first
to
whom
he
had
given
his
*NL*
young
adoration
--
amid
the
throng
of
stupid
criminals
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
a
good
young
man
,
''
she
said
.
``
But
I
do
not
like
husbands
.
I
*NL*
will
never
have
another
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Three
days
afterwards
Lydgate
was
at
his
galvanism
again
in
his
Paris
*NL*
chambers
,
believing
that
illusions
were
at
an
end
for
him
.
He
was
*NL*
saved
from
hardening
effects
by
the
abundant
kindness
of
his
heart
and
*NL*
his
belief
that
human
life
might
be
made
better
.
But
he
had
more
*NL*
reason
than
ever
for
trusting
his
judgment
,
now
that
it
was
so
*NL*
experienced
;
and
henceforth
he
would
take
a
strictly
scientific
view
of
*NL*
woman
,
entertaining
no
expectations
but
such
as
were
justified
*NL*
beforehand
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
one
in
Middlemarch
was
likely
to
have
such
a
notion
of
Lydgate
's
*NL*
past
as
has
here
been
faintly
shadowed
,
and
indeed
the
respectable
*NL*
townsfolk
there
were
not
more
given
than
mortals
generally
to
any
eager
*NL*
attempt
at
exactness
in
the
representation
to
themselves
of
what
did
*NL*
not
come
under
their
own
senses
.
Not
only
young
virgins
of
that
town
,
*NL*
but
gray-bearded
men
also
,
were
often
in
haste
to
conjecture
how
a
new
*NL*
acquaintance
might
be
wrought
into
their
purposes
,
contented
with
very
*NL*
vague
knowledge
as
to
the
way
in
which
life
had
been
shaping
him
for
*NL*
that
instrumentality
.
Middlemarch
,
in
fact
,
counted
on
swallowing
*NL*
Lydgate
and
assimilating
him
very
comfortably
.

SIR
CHARLES
SEDLEY
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
question
whether
Mr.
Tyke
should
be
appointed
as
salaried
chaplain
*NL*
to
the
hospital
was
an
exciting
topic
to
the
Middlemarchers
;
and
*NL*
Lydgate
heard
it
discussed
in
a
way
that
threw
much
light
on
the
power
*NL*
exercised
in
the
town
by
Mr.
Bulstrode
.
The
banker
was
evidently
a
*NL*
ruler
,
but
there
was
an
opposition
party
,
and
even
among
his
supporters
*NL*
there
were
some
who
allowed
it
to
be
seen
that
their
support
was
a
*NL*
compromise
,
and
who
frankly
stated
their
impression
that
the
general
*NL*
scheme
of
things
,
and
especially
the
casualties
of
trade
,
required
you
*NL*
to
hold
a
candle
to
the
devil
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bulstrode
's
power
was
not
due
simply
to
his
being
a
country
banker
,
*NL*
who
knew
the
financial
secrets
of
most
traders
in
the
town
and
could
*NL*
touch
the
springs
of
their
credit
;
it
was
fortified
by
a
beneficence
*NL*
that
was
at
once
ready
and
severe
--
ready
to
confer
obligations
,
and
*NL*
severe
in
watching
the
result
.
He
had
gathered
,
as
an
industrious
man
*NL*
always
at
his
post
,
a
chief
share
in
administering
the
town
charities
,
*NL*
and
his
private
charities
were
both
minute
and
abundant
.
He
would
take
*NL*
a
great
deal
of
pains
about
apprenticing
Tegg
the
shoemaker
's
son
,
and
*NL*
he
would
watch
over
Tegg
's
church-going
;
he
would
defend
Mrs.
Strype
*NL*
the
washerwoman
against
Stubbs
's
unjust
exaction
on
the
score
of
her
*NL*
drying-ground
,
and
he
would
himself
scrutinize
a
calumny
against
Mrs.
*NL*
Strype
.
His
private
minor
loans
were
numerous
,
but
he
would
inquire
*NL*
strictly
into
the
circumstances
both
before
and
after
.
In
this
way
a
*NL*
man
gathers
a
domain
in
his
neighbors
'
hope
and
fear
as
well
as
*NL*
gratitude
;
and
power
,
when
once
it
has
got
into
that
subtle
region
,
*NL*
propagates
itself
,
spreading
out
of
all
proportion
to
its
external
*NL*
means
.
It
was
a
principle
with
Mr.
Bulstrode
to
gain
as
much
power
as
*NL*
possible
,
that
he
might
use
it
for
the
glory
of
God
.
He
went
through
a
*NL*
great
deal
of
spiritual
conflict
and
inward
argument
in
order
to
adjust
*NL*
his
motives
,
and
make
clear
to
himself
what
God
's
glory
required
.
But
,
*NL*
as
we
have
seen
,
his
motives
were
not
always
rightly
appreciated
.
*NL*
There
were
many
crass
minds
in
Middlemarch
whose
reflective
scales
*NL*
could
only
weigh
things
in
the
lump
;
and
they
had
a
strong
suspicion
*NL*
that
since
Mr.
Bulstrode
could
not
enjoy
life
in
their
fashion
,
eating
*NL*
and
drinking
so
little
as
he
did
,
and
worreting
himself
about
*NL*
everything
,
he
must
have
a
sort
of
vampire
's
feast
in
the
sense
of
*NL*
mastery
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
subject
of
the
chaplaincy
came
up
at
Mr.
Vincy
's
table
when
Lydgate
*NL*
was
dining
there
,
and
the
family
connection
with
Mr.
Bulstrode
did
not
,
*NL*
he
observed
,
prevent
some
freedom
of
remark
even
on
the
part
of
the
*NL*
host
himself
,
though
his
reasons
against
the
proposed
arrangement
*NL*
turned
entirely
on
his
objection
to
Mr.
Tyke
's
sermons
,
which
were
all
*NL*
doctrine
,
and
his
preference
for
Mr.
Farebrother
,
whose
sermons
were
*NL*
free
from
that
taint
.
Mr.
Vincy
liked
well
enough
the
notion
of
the
*NL*
chaplain
's
having
a
salary
,
supposing
it
were
given
to
Farebrother
,
who
*NL*
was
as
good
a
little
fellow
as
ever
breathed
,
and
the
best
preacher
*NL*
anywhere
,
and
companionable
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
line
shall
you
take
,
then
?
''
said
Mr.
Chichely
,
the
coroner
,
a
*NL*
great
coursing
comrade
of
Mr.
Vincy
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
'm
precious
glad
I
'm
not
one
of
the
Directors
now
.
I
shall
vote
*NL*
for
referring
the
matter
to
the
Directors
and
the
Medical
Board
*NL*
together
.
I
shall
roll
some
of
my
responsibility
on
your
shoulders
,
*NL*
Doctor
,
''
said
Mr.
Vincy
,
glancing
first
at
Dr.
Sprague
,
the
senior
*NL*
physician
of
the
town
,
and
then
at
Lydgate
who
sat
opposite
.
``
You
*NL*
medical
gentlemen
must
consult
which
sort
of
black
draught
you
will
*NL*
prescribe
,
eh
,
Mr.
Lydgate
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
little
of
either
,
''
said
Lydgate
;
``
but
in
general
,
appointments
*NL*
are
apt
to
be
made
too
much
a
question
of
personal
liking
.
The
fittest
*NL*
man
for
a
particular
post
is
not
always
the
best
fellow
or
the
most
*NL*
agreeable
.
Sometimes
,
if
you
wanted
to
get
a
reform
,
your
only
way
*NL*
would
be
to
pension
off
the
good
fellows
whom
everybody
is
fond
of
,
and
*NL*
put
them
out
of
the
question
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dr.
Sprague
,
who
was
considered
the
physician
of
most
``
weight
,
''
though
*NL*
Dr.
Minchin
was
usually
said
to
have
more
``
penetration
,
''
divested
his
*NL*
large
heavy
face
of
all
expression
,
and
looked
at
his
wine-glass
while
*NL*
Lydgate
was
speaking
.
Whatever
was
not
problematical
and
suspected
*NL*
about
this
young
man
--
for
example
,
a
certain
showiness
as
to
foreign
*NL*
ideas
,
and
a
disposition
to
unsettle
what
had
been
settled
and
*NL*
forgotten
by
his
elders
--
was
positively
unwelcome
to
a
physician
whose
*NL*
standing
had
been
fixed
thirty
years
before
by
a
treatise
on
*NL*
Meningitis
,
of
which
at
least
one
copy
marked
``
own
''
was
bound
in
calf
.
*NL*
For
my
part
I
have
some
fellow-feeling
with
Dr.
Sprague
:
one
's
*NL*
self-satisfaction
is
an
untaxed
kind
of
property
which
it
is
very
*NL*
unpleasant
to
find
deprecated
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lydgate
's
remark
,
however
,
did
not
meet
the
sense
of
the
company
.
Mr.
*NL*
Vincy
said
,
that
if
he
could
have
_
his
_
way
,
he
would
not
put
*NL*
disagreeable
fellows
anywhere
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hang
your
reforms
!
''
said
Mr.
Chichely
.
``
There
's
no
greater
humbug
in
*NL*
the
world
.
You
never
hear
of
a
reform
,
but
it
means
some
trick
to
put
*NL*
in
new
men
.
I
hope
you
are
not
one
of
the
`
Lancet
's
'
men
,
Mr.
*NL*
Lydgate
--
wanting
to
take
the
coronership
out
of
the
hands
of
the
legal
*NL*
profession
:
your
words
appear
to
point
that
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
disapprove
of
Wakley
,
''
interposed
Dr.
Sprague
,
``
no
man
more
:
he
is
*NL*
an
ill-intentioned
fellow
,
who
would
sacrifice
the
respectability
of
*NL*
the
profession
,
which
everybody
knows
depends
on
the
London
Colleges
,
*NL*
for
the
sake
of
getting
some
notoriety
for
himself
.
There
are
men
who
*NL*
do
n't
mind
about
being
kicked
blue
if
they
can
only
get
talked
about
.
*NL*
But
Wakley
is
right
sometimes
,
''
the
Doctor
added
,
judicially
.
``
I
could
*NL*
mention
one
or
two
points
in
which
Wakley
is
in
the
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
well
,
''
said
Mr.
Chichely
,
``
I
blame
no
man
for
standing
up
in
favor
*NL*
of
his
own
cloth
;
but
,
coming
to
argument
,
I
should
like
to
know
how
a
*NL*
coroner
is
to
judge
of
evidence
if
he
has
not
had
a
legal
training
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
my
opinion
,
''
said
Lydgate
,
``
legal
training
only
makes
a
man
more
*NL*
incompetent
in
questions
that
require
knowledge
a
of
another
kind
.
*NL*
People
talk
about
evidence
as
if
it
could
really
be
weighed
in
scales
*NL*
by
a
blind
Justice
.
No
man
can
judge
what
is
good
evidence
on
any
*NL*
particular
subject
,
unless
he
knows
that
subject
well
.
A
lawyer
is
no
*NL*
better
than
an
old
woman
at
a
post-mortem
examination
.
How
is
he
to
*NL*
know
the
action
of
a
poison
?
You
might
as
well
say
that
scanning
verse
*NL*
will
teach
you
to
scan
the
potato
crops
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
aware
,
I
suppose
,
that
it
is
not
the
coroner
's
business
to
*NL*
conduct
the
post-mortem
,
but
only
to
take
the
evidence
of
the
medical
*NL*
witness
?
''
said
Mr.
Chichely
,
with
some
scorn
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
often
almost
as
ignorant
as
the
coroner
himself
,
''
said
Lydgate
.
*NL*
``
Questions
of
medical
jurisprudence
ought
not
to
be
left
to
the
chance
*NL*
of
decent
knowledge
in
a
medical
witness
,
and
the
coroner
ought
not
to
*NL*
be
a
man
who
will
believe
that
strychnine
will
destroy
the
coats
of
the
*NL*
stomach
if
an
ignorant
practitioner
happens
to
tell
him
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lydgate
had
really
lost
sight
of
the
fact
that
Mr.
Chichely
was
his
*NL*
Majesty
's
coroner
,
and
ended
innocently
with
the
question
,
``
Do
n't
you
*NL*
agree
with
me
,
Dr.
Sprague
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
a
certain
extent
--
with
regard
to
populous
districts
,
and
in
the
*NL*
metropolis
,
''
said
the
Doctor
.
``
But
I
hope
it
will
be
long
before
this
*NL*
part
of
the
country
loses
the
services
of
my
friend
Chichely
,
even
*NL*
though
it
might
get
the
best
man
in
our
profession
to
succeed
him
.
I
*NL*
am
sure
Vincy
will
agree
with
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
give
me
a
coroner
who
is
a
good
coursing
man
,
''
said
Mr.
*NL*
Vincy
,
jovially
.
``
And
in
my
opinion
,
you
're
safest
with
a
lawyer
.
*NL*
Nobody
can
know
everything
.
Most
things
are
`
visitation
of
God
.
'
And
as
*NL*
to
poisoning
,
why
,
what
you
want
to
know
is
the
law
.
Come
,
shall
we
*NL*
join
the
ladies
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lydgate
's
private
opinion
was
that
Mr.
Chichely
might
be
the
very
*NL*
coroner
without
bias
as
to
the
coats
of
the
stomach
,
but
he
had
not
*NL*
meant
to
be
personal
.
This
was
one
of
the
difficulties
of
moving
in
*NL*
good
Middlemarch
society
:
it
was
dangerous
to
insist
on
knowledge
as
a
*NL*
qualification
for
any
salaried
office
.
Fred
Vincy
had
called
Lydgate
a
*NL*
prig
,
and
now
Mr.
Chichely
was
inclined
to
call
him
prick-eared
;
*NL*
especially
when
,
in
the
drawing-room
,
he
seemed
to
be
making
himself
*NL*
eminently
agreeable
to
Rosamond
,
whom
he
had
easily
monopolized
in
a
*NL*
tete-a-tete
,
since
Mrs.
Vincy
herself
sat
at
the
tea-table
.
She
*NL*
resigned
no
domestic
function
to
her
daughter
;
and
the
matron
's
*NL*
blooming
good-natured
face
,
with
the
two
volatile
pink
strings
floating
*NL*
from
her
fine
throat
,
and
her
cheery
manners
to
husband
and
children
,
*NL*
was
certainly
among
the
great
attractions
of
the
Vincy
*NL*
house
--
attractions
which
made
it
all
the
easier
to
fall
in
love
with
*NL*
the
daughter
.
The
tinge
of
unpretentious
,
inoffensive
vulgarity
in
*NL*
Mrs.
Vincy
gave
more
effect
to
Rosamond
's
refinement
,
which
was
beyond
*NL*
what
Lydgate
had
expected
.
*NL*
*NL*
Certainly
,
small
feet
and
perfectly
turned
shoulders
aid
the
impression
*NL*
of
refined
manners
,
and
the
right
thing
said
seems
quite
astonishingly
*NL*
right
when
it
is
accompanied
with
exquisite
curves
of
lip
and
eyelid
.
*NL*
And
Rosamond
could
say
the
right
thing
;
for
she
was
clever
with
that
*NL*
sort
of
cleverness
which
catches
every
tone
except
the
humorous
.
*NL*
Happily
she
never
attempted
to
joke
,
and
this
perhaps
was
the
most
*NL*
decisive
mark
of
her
cleverness
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
and
Lydgate
readily
got
into
conversation
.
He
regretted
that
he
*NL*
had
not
heard
her
sing
the
other
day
at
Stone
Court
.
The
only
pleasure
*NL*
he
allowed
himself
during
the
latter
part
of
his
stay
in
Paris
was
to
*NL*
go
and
hear
music
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
studied
music
,
probably
?
''
said
Rosamond
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
know
the
notes
of
many
birds
,
and
I
know
many
melodies
by
ear
;
*NL*
but
the
music
that
I
do
n't
know
at
all
,
and
have
no
notion
about
,
*NL*
delights
me
--
affects
me
.
How
stupid
the
world
is
that
it
does
not
make
*NL*
more
use
of
such
a
pleasure
within
its
reach
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
and
you
will
find
Middlemarch
very
tuneless
.
There
are
hardly
*NL*
any
good
musicians
.
I
only
know
two
gentlemen
who
sing
at
all
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
it
is
the
fashion
to
sing
comic
songs
in
a
rhythmic
way
,
*NL*
leaving
you
to
fancy
the
tune
--
very
much
as
if
it
were
tapped
on
a
*NL*
drum
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
you
have
heard
Mr.
Bowyer
,
''
said
Rosamond
,
with
one
of
her
rare
*NL*
smiles
.
``
But
we
are
speaking
very
ill
of
our
neighbors
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lydgate
was
almost
forgetting
that
he
must
carry
on
the
conversation
,
*NL*
in
thinking
how
lovely
this
creature
was
,
her
garment
seeming
to
be
*NL*
made
out
of
the
faintest
blue
sky
,
herself
so
immaculately
blond
,
as
if
*NL*
the
petals
of
some
gigantic
flower
had
just
opened
and
disclosed
her
;
*NL*
and
yet
with
this
infantine
blondness
showing
so
much
ready
,
*NL*
self-possessed
grace
.
Since
he
had
had
the
memory
of
Laure
,
Lydgate
*NL*
had
lost
all
taste
for
large-eyed
silence
:
the
divine
cow
no
longer
*NL*
attracted
him
,
and
Rosamond
was
her
very
opposite
.
But
he
recalled
*NL*
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
let
me
hear
some
music
to-night
,
I
hope
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
let
you
hear
my
attempts
,
if
you
like
,
''
said
Rosamond
.
``
Papa
*NL*
is
sure
to
insist
on
my
singing
.
But
I
shall
tremble
before
you
,
who
*NL*
have
heard
the
best
singers
in
Paris
.
I
have
heard
very
little
:
I
have
*NL*
only
once
been
to
London
.
But
our
organist
at
St.
Peter
's
is
a
good
*NL*
musician
,
and
I
go
on
studying
with
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
what
you
saw
in
London
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
little
.
''
-LRB-
A
more
naive
girl
would
have
said
,
``
Oh
,
everything
!
''
*NL*
But
Rosamond
knew
better
.
-RRB-
``
A
few
of
the
ordinary
sights
,
such
as
raw
*NL*
country
girls
are
always
taken
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
call
yourself
a
raw
country
girl
?
''
said
Lydgate
,
looking
at
her
*NL*
with
an
involuntary
emphasis
of
admiration
,
which
made
Rosamond
blush
*NL*
with
pleasure
.
But
she
remained
simply
serious
,
turned
her
long
neck
a
*NL*
little
,
and
put
up
her
hand
to
touch
her
wondrous
hair-plaits
--
an
*NL*
habitual
gesture
with
her
as
pretty
as
any
movements
of
a
kitten
's
paw
.
*NL*
Not
that
Rosamond
was
in
the
least
like
a
kitten
:
she
was
a
sylph
*NL*
caught
young
and
educated
at
Mrs.
Lemon
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
assure
you
my
mind
is
raw
,
''
she
said
immediately
;
``
I
pass
at
*NL*
Middlemarch
.
I
am
not
afraid
of
talking
to
our
old
neighbors
.
But
I
*NL*
am
really
afraid
of
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
accomplished
woman
almost
always
knows
more
than
we
men
,
though
her
*NL*
knowledge
is
of
a
different
sort
.
I
am
sure
you
could
teach
me
a
*NL*
thousand
things
--
as
an
exquisite
bird
could
teach
a
bear
if
there
were
*NL*
any
common
language
between
them
.
Happily
,
there
is
a
common
language
*NL*
between
women
and
men
,
and
so
the
bears
can
get
taught
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
there
is
Fred
beginning
to
strum
!
I
must
go
and
hinder
him
from
*NL*
jarring
all
your
nerves
,
''
said
Rosamond
,
moving
to
the
other
side
of
*NL*
the
room
,
where
Fred
having
opened
the
piano
,
at
his
father
's
desire
,
*NL*
that
Rosamond
might
give
them
some
music
,
was
parenthetically
*NL*
performing
``
Cherry
Ripe
!
''
with
one
hand
.
Able
men
who
have
passed
*NL*
their
examinations
will
do
these
things
sometimes
,
not
less
than
the
*NL*
plucked
Fred
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fred
,
pray
defer
your
practising
till
to-morrow
;
you
will
make
Mr.
*NL*
Lydgate
ill
,
''
said
Rosamond
.
``
He
has
an
ear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fred
laughed
,
and
went
on
with
his
tune
to
the
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rosamond
turned
to
Lydgate
,
smiling
gently
,
and
said
,
``
You
perceive
,
*NL*
the
bears
will
not
always
be
taught
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
then
,
Rosy
!
''
said
Fred
,
springing
from
the
stool
and
twisting
it
*NL*
upward
for
her
,
with
a
hearty
expectation
of
enjoyment
.
``
Some
good
*NL*
rousing
tunes
first
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Rosamond
played
admirably
.
Her
master
at
Mrs.
Lemon
's
school
-LRB-
close
to
*NL*
a
county
town
with
a
memorable
history
that
had
its
relics
in
church
*NL*
and
castle
-RRB-
was
one
of
those
excellent
musicians
here
and
there
to
be
*NL*
found
in
our
provinces
,
worthy
to
compare
with
many
a
noted
*NL*
Kapellmeister
in
a
country
which
offers
more
plentiful
conditions
of
*NL*
musical
celebrity
.
Rosamond
,
with
the
executant
's
instinct
,
had
seized
*NL*
his
manner
of
playing
,
and
gave
forth
his
large
rendering
of
noble
*NL*
music
with
the
precision
of
an
echo
.
It
was
almost
startling
,
heard
*NL*
for
the
first
time
.
A
hidden
soul
seemed
to
be
flowing
forth
from
*NL*
Rosamond
's
fingers
;
and
so
indeed
it
was
,
since
souls
live
on
in
*NL*
perpetual
echoes
,
and
to
all
fine
expression
there
goes
somewhere
an
*NL*
originating
activity
,
if
it
be
only
that
of
an
interpreter
.
Lydgate
*NL*
was
taken
possession
of
,
and
began
to
believe
in
her
as
something
*NL*
exceptional
.
After
all
,
he
thought
,
one
need
not
be
surprised
to
find
*NL*
the
rare
conjunctions
of
nature
under
circumstances
apparently
*NL*
unfavorable
:
come
where
they
may
,
they
always
depend
on
conditions
that
*NL*
are
not
obvious
.
He
sat
looking
at
her
,
and
did
not
rise
to
pay
her
*NL*
any
compliments
,
leaving
that
to
others
,
now
that
his
admiration
was
*NL*
deepened
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
singing
was
less
remarkable
,
but
also
well
trained
,
and
sweet
to
*NL*
hear
as
a
chime
perfectly
in
tune
.
It
is
true
she
sang
``
Meet
me
by
*NL*
moonlight
,
''
and
``
I
've
been
roaming
''
;
for
mortals
must
share
the
*NL*
fashions
of
their
time
,
and
none
but
the
ancients
can
be
always
*NL*
classical
.
But
Rosamond
could
also
sing
``
Black-eyed
Susan
''
with
*NL*
effect
,
or
Haydn
's
canzonets
,
or
``
Voi
,
che
sapete
,
''
or
``
Batti
,
*NL*
batti
''
--
she
only
wanted
to
know
what
her
audience
liked
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
father
looked
round
at
the
company
,
delighting
in
their
admiration
.
*NL*
Her
mother
sat
,
like
a
Niobe
before
her
troubles
,
with
her
youngest
*NL*
little
girl
on
her
lap
,
softly
beating
the
child
's
hand
up
and
down
in
*NL*
time
to
the
music
.
And
Fred
,
notwithstanding
his
general
scepticism
*NL*
about
Rosy
,
listened
to
her
music
with
perfect
allegiance
,
wishing
he
*NL*
could
do
the
same
thing
on
his
flute
.
It
was
the
pleasantest
family
*NL*
party
that
Lydgate
had
seen
since
he
came
to
Middlemarch
.
The
Vincys
*NL*
had
the
readiness
to
enjoy
,
the
rejection
of
all
anxiety
,
and
the
*NL*
belief
in
life
as
a
merry
lot
,
which
made
a
house
exceptional
in
most
*NL*
county
towns
at
that
time
,
when
Evangelicalism
had
cast
a
certain
*NL*
suspicion
as
of
plague-infection
over
the
few
amusements
which
survived
*NL*
in
the
provinces
.
At
the
Vincys
'
there
was
always
whist
,
and
the
*NL*
card-tables
stood
ready
now
,
making
some
of
the
company
secretly
*NL*
impatient
of
the
music
.
Before
it
ceased
Mr.
Farebrother
came
in
--
a
*NL*
handsome
,
broad-chested
but
otherwise
small
man
,
about
forty
,
whose
*NL*
black
was
very
threadbare
:
the
brilliancy
was
all
in
his
quick
gray
*NL*
eyes
.
He
came
like
a
pleasant
change
in
the
light
,
arresting
little
*NL*
Louisa
with
fatherly
nonsense
as
she
was
being
led
out
of
the
room
by
*NL*
Miss
Morgan
,
greeting
everybody
with
some
special
word
,
and
seeming
to
*NL*
condense
more
talk
into
ten
minutes
than
had
been
held
all
through
the
*NL*
evening
.
He
claimed
from
Lydgate
the
fulfilment
of
a
promise
to
come
*NL*
and
see
him
.
``
I
ca
n't
let
you
off
,
you
know
,
because
I
have
some
*NL*
beetles
to
show
you
.
We
collectors
feel
an
interest
in
every
new
man
*NL*
till
he
has
seen
all
we
have
to
show
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
soon
he
swerved
to
the
whist-table
,
rubbing
his
hands
and
saying
,
*NL*
``
Come
now
,
let
us
be
serious
!
Mr.
Lydgate
?
not
play
?
Ah
!
you
are
too
*NL*
young
and
light
for
this
kind
of
thing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lydgate
said
to
himself
that
the
clergyman
whose
abilities
were
so
*NL*
painful
to
Mr.
Bulstrode
,
appeared
to
have
found
an
agreeable
resort
in
*NL*
this
certainly
not
erudite
household
.
He
could
half
understand
it
:
the
*NL*
good-humor
,
the
good
looks
of
elder
and
younger
,
and
the
provision
for
*NL*
passing
the
time
without
any
labor
of
intelligence
,
might
make
the
*NL*
house
beguiling
to
people
who
had
no
particular
use
for
their
odd
hours
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everything
looked
blooming
and
joyous
except
Miss
Morgan
,
who
was
*NL*
brown
,
dull
,
and
resigned
,
and
altogether
,
as
Mrs.
Vincy
often
said
,
*NL*
just
the
sort
of
person
for
a
governess
.
Lydgate
did
not
mean
to
pay
*NL*
many
such
visits
himself
.
They
were
a
wretched
waste
of
the
evenings
;
*NL*
and
now
,
when
he
had
talked
a
little
more
to
Rosamond
,
he
meant
to
*NL*
excuse
himself
and
go
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
not
like
us
at
Middlemarch
,
I
feel
sure
,
''
she
said
,
when
the
*NL*
whist-players
were
settled
.
``
We
are
very
stupid
,
and
you
have
been
*NL*
used
to
something
quite
different
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
all
country
towns
are
pretty
much
alike
,
''
said
Lydgate
.
*NL*
``
But
I
have
noticed
that
one
always
believes
one
's
own
town
to
be
more
*NL*
stupid
than
any
other
.
I
have
made
up
my
mind
to
take
Middlemarch
as
*NL*
it
comes
,
and
shall
be
much
obliged
if
the
town
will
take
me
in
the
*NL*
same
way
.
I
have
certainly
found
some
charms
in
it
which
are
much
*NL*
greater
than
I
had
expected
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
mean
the
rides
towards
Tipton
and
Lowick
;
every
one
is
pleased
*NL*
with
those
,
''
said
Rosamond
,
with
simplicity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
mean
something
much
nearer
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Rosamond
rose
and
reached
her
netting
,
and
then
said
,
``
Do
you
care
*NL*
about
dancing
at
all
?
I
am
not
quite
sure
whether
clever
men
ever
*NL*
dance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
dance
with
you
if
you
would
allow
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
said
Rosamond
,
with
a
slight
deprecatory
laugh
.
``
I
was
only
*NL*
going
to
say
that
we
sometimes
have
dancing
,
and
I
wanted
to
know
*NL*
whether
you
would
feel
insulted
if
you
were
asked
to
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
on
the
condition
I
mentioned
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
this
chat
Lydgate
thought
that
he
was
going
,
but
on
moving
*NL*
towards
the
whist-tables
,
he
got
interested
in
watching
Mr.
*NL*
Farebrother
's
play
,
which
was
masterly
,
and
also
his
face
,
which
was
a
*NL*
striking
mixture
of
the
shrewd
and
the
mild
.
At
ten
o'clock
supper
was
*NL*
brought
in
-LRB-
such
were
the
customs
of
Middlemarch
-RRB-
and
there
was
*NL*
punch-drinking
;
but
Mr.
Farebrother
had
only
a
glass
of
water
.
He
was
*NL*
winning
,
but
there
seemed
to
be
no
reason
why
the
renewal
of
rubbers
*NL*
should
end
,
and
Lydgate
at
last
took
his
leave
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
as
it
was
not
eleven
o'clock
,
he
chose
to
walk
in
the
brisk
air
*NL*
towards
the
tower
of
St.
Botolph
's
,
Mr.
Farebrother
's
church
,
which
*NL*
stood
out
dark
,
square
,
and
massive
against
the
starlight
.
It
was
the
*NL*
oldest
church
in
Middlemarch
;
the
living
,
however
,
was
but
a
vicarage
*NL*
worth
barely
four
hundred
a-year
.
Lydgate
had
heard
that
,
and
he
*NL*
wondered
now
whether
Mr.
Farebrother
cared
about
the
money
he
won
at
*NL*
cards
;
thinking
,
``
He
seems
a
very
pleasant
fellow
,
but
Bulstrode
may
*NL*
have
his
good
reasons
.
''
Many
things
would
be
easier
to
Lydgate
if
it
*NL*
should
turn
out
that
Mr.
Bulstrode
was
generally
justifiable
.
``
What
is
*NL*
his
religious
doctrine
to
me
,
if
he
carries
some
good
notions
along
*NL*
with
it
?
One
must
use
such
brains
as
are
to
be
found
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
These
were
actually
Lydgate
's
first
meditations
as
he
walked
away
from
*NL*
Mr.
Vincy
's
,
and
on
this
ground
I
fear
that
many
ladies
will
consider
*NL*
him
hardly
worthy
of
their
attention
.
He
thought
of
Rosamond
and
her
*NL*
music
only
in
the
second
place
;
and
though
,
when
her
turn
came
,
he
*NL*
dwelt
on
the
image
of
her
for
the
rest
of
his
walk
,
he
felt
no
*NL*
agitation
,
and
had
no
sense
that
any
new
current
had
set
into
his
life
.
*NL*
He
could
not
marry
yet
;
he
wished
not
to
marry
for
several
years
;
and
*NL*
therefore
he
was
not
ready
to
entertain
the
notion
of
being
in
love
*NL*
with
a
girl
whom
he
happened
to
admire
.
He
did
admire
Rosamond
*NL*
exceedingly
;
but
that
madness
which
had
once
beset
him
about
Laure
was
*NL*
not
,
he
thought
,
likely
to
recur
in
relation
to
any
other
woman
.
*NL*
Certainly
,
if
falling
in
love
had
been
at
all
in
question
,
it
would
*NL*
have
been
quite
safe
with
a
creature
like
this
Miss
Vincy
,
who
had
just
*NL*
the
kind
of
intelligence
one
would
desire
in
a
woman
--
polished
,
*NL*
refined
,
docile
,
lending
itself
to
finish
in
all
the
delicacies
of
*NL*
life
,
and
enshrined
in
a
body
which
expressed
this
with
a
force
of
*NL*
demonstration
that
excluded
the
need
for
other
evidence
.
Lydgate
felt
*NL*
sure
that
if
ever
he
married
,
his
wife
would
have
that
feminine
*NL*
radiance
,
that
distinctive
womanhood
which
must
be
classed
with
flowers
*NL*
and
music
,
that
sort
of
beauty
which
by
its
very
nature
was
virtuous
,
*NL*
being
moulded
only
for
pure
and
delicate
joys
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
since
he
did
not
mean
to
marry
for
the
next
five
years
--
his
more
*NL*
pressing
business
was
to
look
into
Louis
'
new
book
on
Fever
,
which
he
*NL*
was
specially
interested
in
,
because
he
had
known
Louis
in
Paris
,
and
*NL*
had
followed
many
anatomical
demonstrations
in
order
to
ascertain
the
*NL*
specific
differences
of
typhus
and
typhoid
.
He
went
home
and
read
far
*NL*
into
the
smallest
hour
,
bringing
a
much
more
testing
vision
of
details
*NL*
and
relations
into
this
pathological
study
than
he
had
ever
thought
it
*NL*
necessary
to
apply
to
the
complexities
of
love
and
marriage
,
these
*NL*
being
subjects
on
which
he
felt
himself
amply
informed
by
literature
,
*NL*
and
that
traditional
wisdom
which
is
handed
down
in
the
genial
*NL*
conversation
of
men
.
Whereas
Fever
had
obscure
conditions
,
and
gave
*NL*
him
that
delightful
labor
of
the
imagination
which
is
not
mere
*NL*
arbitrariness
,
but
the
exercise
of
disciplined
power
--
combining
and
*NL*
constructing
with
the
clearest
eye
for
probabilities
and
the
fullest
*NL*
obedience
to
knowledge
;
and
then
,
in
yet
more
energetic
alliance
with
*NL*
impartial
Nature
,
standing
aloof
to
invent
tests
by
which
to
try
its
*NL*
own
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
Many
men
have
been
praised
as
vividly
imaginative
on
the
strength
of
*NL*
their
profuseness
in
indifferent
drawing
or
cheap
narration
:
--
reports
*NL*
of
very
poor
talk
going
on
in
distant
orbs
;
or
portraits
of
Lucifer
*NL*
coming
down
on
his
bad
errands
as
a
large
ugly
man
with
bat
's
wings
and
*NL*
spurts
of
phosphorescence
;
or
exaggerations
of
wantonness
that
seem
to
*NL*
reflect
life
in
a
diseased
dream
.
But
these
kinds
of
inspiration
*NL*
Lydgate
regarded
as
rather
vulgar
and
vinous
compared
with
the
*NL*
imagination
that
reveals
subtle
actions
inaccessible
by
any
sort
of
*NL*
lens
,
but
tracked
in
that
outer
darkness
through
long
pathways
of
*NL*
necessary
sequence
by
the
inward
light
which
is
the
last
refinement
of
*NL*
Energy
,
capable
of
bathing
even
the
ethereal
atoms
in
its
ideally
*NL*
illuminated
space
.
He
for
his
part
had
tossed
away
all
cheap
*NL*
inventions
where
ignorance
finds
itself
able
and
at
ease
:
he
was
*NL*
enamoured
of
that
arduous
invention
which
is
the
very
eye
of
research
,
*NL*
provisionally
framing
its
object
and
correcting
it
to
more
and
more
*NL*
exactness
of
relation
;
he
wanted
to
pierce
the
obscurity
of
those
*NL*
minute
processes
which
prepare
human
misery
and
joy
,
those
invisible
*NL*
thoroughfares
which
are
the
first
lurking-places
of
anguish
,
mania
,
and
*NL*
crime
,
that
delicate
poise
and
transition
which
determine
the
growth
of
*NL*
happy
or
unhappy
consciousness
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
threw
down
his
book
,
stretched
his
legs
towards
the
embers
in
the
*NL*
grate
,
and
clasped
his
hands
at
the
back
of
his
head
,
in
that
agreeable
*NL*
afterglow
of
excitement
when
thought
lapses
from
examination
of
a
*NL*
specific
object
into
a
suffusive
sense
of
its
connections
with
all
the
*NL*
rest
of
our
existence
--
seems
,
as
it
were
,
to
throw
itself
on
its
back
*NL*
after
vigorous
swimming
and
float
with
the
repose
of
unexhausted
*NL*
strength
--
Lydgate
felt
a
triumphant
delight
in
his
studies
,
and
*NL*
something
like
pity
for
those
less
lucky
men
who
were
not
of
his
*NL*
profession
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
had
not
taken
that
turn
when
I
was
a
lad
,
''
he
thought
,
``
I
might
*NL*
have
got
into
some
stupid
draught-horse
work
or
other
,
and
lived
always
*NL*
in
blinkers
.
I
should
never
have
been
happy
in
any
profession
that
did
*NL*
not
call
forth
the
highest
intellectual
strain
,
and
yet
keep
me
in
good
*NL*
warm
contact
with
my
neighbors
.
There
is
nothing
like
the
medical
*NL*
profession
for
that
:
one
can
have
the
exclusive
scientific
life
that
*NL*
touches
the
distance
and
befriend
the
old
fogies
in
the
parish
too
.
It
*NL*
is
rather
harder
for
a
clergyman
:
Farebrother
seems
to
be
an
anomaly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
last
thought
brought
back
the
Vincys
and
all
the
pictures
of
the
*NL*
evening
.
They
floated
in
his
mind
agreeably
enough
,
and
as
he
took
up
*NL*
his
bed-candle
his
lips
were
curled
with
that
incipient
smile
which
is
*NL*
apt
to
accompany
agreeable
recollections
.
He
was
an
ardent
fellow
,
but
*NL*
at
present
his
ardor
was
absorbed
in
love
of
his
work
and
in
the
*NL*
ambition
of
making
his
life
recognized
as
a
factor
in
the
better
life
*NL*
of
mankind
--
like
other
heroes
of
science
who
had
nothing
but
an
obscure
*NL*
country
practice
to
begin
with
.
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Lydgate
!
or
shall
I
say
,
Poor
Rosamond
!
Each
lived
in
a
world
of
*NL*
which
the
other
knew
nothing
.
It
had
not
occurred
to
Lydgate
that
he
*NL*
had
been
a
subject
of
eager
meditation
to
Rosamond
,
who
had
neither
any
*NL*
reason
for
throwing
her
marriage
into
distant
perspective
,
nor
any
*NL*
pathological
studies
to
divert
her
mind
from
that
ruminating
habit
,
*NL*
that
inward
repetition
of
looks
,
words
,
and
phrases
,
which
makes
a
*NL*
large
part
in
the
lives
of
most
girls
.
He
had
not
meant
to
look
at
her
*NL*
or
speak
to
her
with
more
than
the
inevitable
amount
of
admiration
and
*NL*
compliment
which
a
man
must
give
to
a
beautiful
girl
;
indeed
,
it
seemed
*NL*
to
him
that
his
enjoyment
of
her
music
had
remained
almost
silent
,
for
*NL*
he
feared
falling
into
the
rudeness
of
telling
her
his
great
surprise
*NL*
at
her
possession
of
such
accomplishment
.
But
Rosamond
had
registered
*NL*
every
look
and
word
,
and
estimated
them
as
the
opening
incidents
of
a
*NL*
preconceived
romance
--
incidents
which
gather
value
from
the
foreseen
*NL*
development
and
climax
.
In
Rosamond
's
romance
it
was
not
necessary
to
*NL*
imagine
much
about
the
inward
life
of
the
hero
,
or
of
his
serious
*NL*
business
in
the
world
:
of
course
,
he
had
a
profession
and
was
clever
,
*NL*
as
well
as
sufficiently
handsome
;
but
the
piquant
fact
about
Lydgate
*NL*
was
his
good
birth
,
which
distinguished
him
from
all
Middlemarch
*NL*
admirers
,
and
presented
marriage
as
a
prospect
of
rising
in
rank
and
*NL*
getting
a
little
nearer
to
that
celestial
condition
on
earth
in
which
*NL*
she
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
vulgar
people
,
and
perhaps
at
last
*NL*
associate
with
relatives
quite
equal
to
the
county
people
who
looked
*NL*
down
on
the
Middlemarchers
.
It
was
part
of
Rosamond
's
cleverness
to
*NL*
discern
very
subtly
the
faintest
aroma
of
rank
,
and
once
when
she
had
*NL*
seen
the
Miss
Brookes
accompanying
their
uncle
at
the
county
assizes
,
*NL*
and
seated
among
the
aristocracy
,
she
had
envied
them
,
notwithstanding
*NL*
their
plain
dress
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
you
think
it
incredible
that
to
imagine
Lydgate
as
a
man
of
family
*NL*
could
cause
thrills
of
satisfaction
which
had
anything
to
do
with
the
*NL*
sense
that
she
was
in
love
with
him
,
I
will
ask
you
to
use
your
power
*NL*
of
comparison
a
little
more
effectively
,
and
consider
whether
red
cloth
*NL*
and
epaulets
have
never
had
an
influence
of
that
sort
.
Our
passions
do
*NL*
not
live
apart
in
locked
chambers
,
but
,
dressed
in
their
small
wardrobe
*NL*
of
notions
,
bring
their
provisions
to
a
common
table
and
mess
together
,
*NL*
feeding
out
of
the
common
store
according
to
their
appetite
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rosamond
,
in
fact
,
was
entirely
occupied
not
exactly
with
Tertius
*NL*
Lydgate
as
he
was
in
himself
,
but
with
his
relation
to
her
;
and
it
was
*NL*
excusable
in
a
girl
who
was
accustomed
to
hear
that
all
young
men
*NL*
might
,
could
,
would
be
,
or
actually
were
in
love
with
her
,
to
believe
*NL*
at
once
that
Lydgate
could
be
no
exception
.
His
looks
and
words
meant
*NL*
more
to
her
than
other
men
's
,
because
she
cared
more
for
them
:
she
*NL*
thought
of
them
diligently
,
and
diligently
attended
to
that
perfection
*NL*
of
appearance
,
behavior
,
sentiments
,
and
all
other
elegancies
,
which
*NL*
would
find
in
Lydgate
a
more
adequate
admirer
than
she
had
yet
been
*NL*
conscious
of
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
Rosamond
,
though
she
would
never
do
anything
that
was
disagreeable
*NL*
to
her
,
was
industrious
;
and
now
more
than
ever
she
was
active
in
*NL*
sketching
her
landscapes
and
market-carts
and
portraits
of
friends
,
in
*NL*
practising
her
music
,
and
in
being
from
morning
till
night
her
own
*NL*
standard
of
a
perfect
lady
,
having
always
an
audience
in
her
own
*NL*
consciousness
,
with
sometimes
the
not
unwelcome
addition
of
a
more
*NL*
variable
external
audience
in
the
numerous
visitors
of
the
house
.
She
*NL*
found
time
also
to
read
the
best
novels
,
and
even
the
second
best
,
and
*NL*
she
knew
much
poetry
by
heart
.
Her
favorite
poem
was
``
Lalla
Rookh
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
best
girl
in
the
world
!
He
will
be
a
happy
fellow
who
gets
her
!
''
*NL*
was
the
sentiment
of
the
elderly
gentlemen
who
visited
the
Vincys
;
and
*NL*
the
rejected
young
men
thought
of
trying
again
,
as
is
the
fashion
in
*NL*
country
towns
where
the
horizon
is
not
thick
with
coming
rivals
.
But
*NL*
Mrs.
Plymdale
thought
that
Rosamond
had
been
educated
to
a
ridiculous
*NL*
pitch
,
for
what
was
the
use
of
accomplishments
which
would
be
all
laid
*NL*
aside
as
soon
as
she
was
married
?
While
her
aunt
Bulstrode
,
who
had
a
*NL*
sisterly
faithfulness
towards
her
brother
's
family
,
had
two
sincere
*NL*
wishes
for
Rosamond
--
that
she
might
show
a
more
serious
turn
of
mind
,
*NL*
and
that
she
might
meet
with
a
husband
whose
wealth
corresponded
to
her
*NL*
habits
.

*NL*
The
Rev.
Camden
Farebrother
,
whom
Lydgate
went
to
see
the
next
evening
,
*NL*
lived
in
an
old
parsonage
,
built
of
stone
,
venerable
enough
to
match
*NL*
the
church
which
it
looked
out
upon
.
All
the
furniture
too
in
the
*NL*
house
was
old
,
but
with
another
grade
of
age
--
that
of
Mr.
Farebrother
's
*NL*
father
and
grandfather
.
There
were
painted
white
chairs
,
with
gilding
*NL*
and
wreaths
on
them
,
and
some
lingering
red
silk
damask
with
slits
in
*NL*
it
.
There
were
engraved
portraits
of
Lord
Chancellors
and
other
*NL*
celebrated
lawyers
of
the
last
century
;
and
there
were
old
pier-glasses
*NL*
to
reflect
them
,
as
well
as
the
little
satin-wood
tables
and
the
sofas
*NL*
resembling
a
prolongation
of
uneasy
chairs
,
all
standing
in
relief
*NL*
against
the
dark
wainscot
.
This
was
the
physiognomy
of
the
drawing-room
*NL*
into
which
Lydgate
was
shown
;
and
there
were
three
ladies
to
receive
*NL*
him
,
who
were
also
old-fashioned
,
and
of
a
faded
but
genuine
*NL*
respectability
:
Mrs.
Farebrother
,
the
Vicar
's
white-haired
mother
,
*NL*
befrilled
and
kerchiefed
with
dainty
cleanliness
,
upright
,
quick-eyed
,
*NL*
and
still
under
seventy
;
Miss
Noble
,
her
sister
,
a
tiny
old
lady
of
*NL*
meeker
aspect
,
with
frills
and
kerchief
decidedly
more
worn
and
mended
;
*NL*
and
Miss
Winifred
Farebrother
,
the
Vicar
's
elder
sister
,
well-looking
*NL*
like
himself
,
but
nipped
and
subdued
as
single
women
are
apt
to
be
who
*NL*
spend
their
lives
in
uninterrupted
subjection
to
their
elders
.
Lydgate
*NL*
had
not
expected
to
see
so
quaint
a
group
:
knowing
simply
that
Mr.
*NL*
Farebrother
was
a
bachelor
,
he
had
thought
of
being
ushered
into
a
*NL*
snuggery
where
the
chief
furniture
would
probably
be
books
and
*NL*
collections
of
natural
objects
.
The
Vicar
himself
seemed
to
wear
*NL*
rather
a
changed
aspect
,
as
most
men
do
when
acquaintances
made
*NL*
elsewhere
see
them
for
the
first
time
in
their
own
homes
;
some
indeed
*NL*
showing
like
an
actor
of
genial
parts
disadvantageously
cast
for
the
*NL*
curmudgeon
in
a
new
piece
.
This
was
not
the
case
with
Mr.
Farebrother
:
*NL*
he
seemed
a
trifle
milder
and
more
silent
,
the
chief
talker
being
his
*NL*
mother
,
while
he
only
put
in
a
good-humored
moderating
remark
here
and
*NL*
there
.
The
old
lady
was
evidently
accustomed
to
tell
her
company
what
*NL*
they
ought
to
think
,
and
to
regard
no
subject
as
quite
safe
without
her
*NL*
steering
.
She
was
afforded
leisure
for
this
function
by
having
all
her
*NL*
little
wants
attended
to
by
Miss
Winifred
.
Meanwhile
tiny
Miss
Noble
*NL*
carried
on
her
arm
a
small
basket
,
into
which
she
diverted
a
bit
of
*NL*
sugar
,
which
she
had
first
dropped
in
her
saucer
as
if
by
mistake
;
*NL*
looking
round
furtively
afterwards
,
and
reverting
to
her
teacup
with
a
*NL*
small
innocent
noise
as
of
a
tiny
timid
quadruped
.
Pray
think
no
ill
*NL*
of
Miss
Noble
.
That
basket
held
small
savings
from
her
more
portable
*NL*
food
,
destined
for
the
children
of
her
poor
friends
among
whom
she
*NL*
trotted
on
fine
mornings
;
fostering
and
petting
all
needy
creatures
*NL*
being
so
spontaneous
a
delight
to
her
,
that
she
regarded
it
much
as
if
*NL*
it
had
been
a
pleasant
vice
that
she
was
addicted
to
.
Perhaps
she
was
*NL*
conscious
of
being
tempted
to
steal
from
those
who
had
much
that
she
*NL*
might
give
to
those
who
had
nothing
,
and
carried
in
her
conscience
the
*NL*
guilt
of
that
repressed
desire
.
One
must
be
poor
to
know
the
luxury
of
*NL*
giving
!
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Farebrother
welcomed
the
guest
with
a
lively
formality
and
*NL*
precision
.
She
presently
informed
him
that
they
were
not
often
in
want
*NL*
of
medical
aid
in
that
house
.
She
had
brought
up
her
children
to
wear
*NL*
flannel
and
not
to
over-eat
themselves
,
which
last
habit
she
considered
*NL*
the
chief
reason
why
people
needed
doctors
.
Lydgate
pleaded
for
those
*NL*
whose
fathers
and
mothers
had
over-eaten
themselves
,
but
Mrs.
*NL*
Farebrother
held
that
view
of
things
dangerous
:
Nature
was
more
just
*NL*
than
that
;
it
would
be
easy
for
any
felon
to
say
that
his
ancestors
*NL*
ought
to
have
been
hanged
instead
of
him
.
If
those
who
had
bad
fathers
*NL*
and
mothers
were
bad
themselves
,
they
were
hanged
for
that
.
There
was
*NL*
no
need
to
go
back
on
what
you
could
n't
see
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
mother
is
like
old
George
the
Third
,
''
said
the
Vicar
,
``
she
objects
*NL*
to
metaphysics
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
object
to
what
is
wrong
,
Camden
.
I
say
,
keep
hold
of
a
few
plain
*NL*
truths
,
and
make
everything
square
with
them
.
When
I
was
young
,
Mr.
*NL*
Lydgate
,
there
never
was
any
question
about
right
and
wrong
.
We
knew
*NL*
our
catechism
,
and
that
was
enough
;
we
learned
our
creed
and
our
duty
.
*NL*
Every
respectable
Church
person
had
the
same
opinions
.
But
now
,
if
you
*NL*
speak
out
of
the
Prayer-book
itself
,
you
are
liable
to
be
contradicted
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
makes
rather
a
pleasant
time
of
it
for
those
who
like
to
maintain
*NL*
their
own
point

said
Lydgate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
my
mother
always
gives
way
,
''
said
the
Vicar
,
slyly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
Camden
,
you
must
not
lead
Mr.
Lydgate
into
a
mistake
about
*NL*
_
me
_
.
I
shall
never
show
that
disrespect
to
my
parents
,
to
give
up
what
*NL*
they
taught
me
.
Any
one
may
see
what
comes
of
turning
.
If
you
change
*NL*
once
,
why
not
twenty
times
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
man
might
see
good
arguments
for
changing
once
,
and
not
see
them
for
*NL*
changing
again

said
Lydgate
,
amused
with
the
decisive
old
lady
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excuse
me
there

If
you
go
upon
arguments

they
are
never
wanting
,
*NL*
when
a
man
has
no
constancy
of
mind

My
father
never
changed
,
and
he
*NL*
preached
plain
moral
sermons
without
arguments
,
and
was
a
good
man
--
few
*NL*
better
.
When
you
get
me
a
good
man
made
out
of
arguments
,
I
will
get
*NL*
you
a
good
dinner
with
reading
you
the
cookery-book
.
That
's
my
opinion
,
*NL*

I
think
anybody
's
stomach
will
bear
me
out

*NL*
*NL*
``
About
the
dinner

said
Mr.
Farebrother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
the
same
thing
,
the
dinner
or
the
man
.
I
am
nearly
seventy
,
Mr.
*NL*
Lydgate
,
and
I
go
upon
experience
.
I
am
not
likely
to
follow
new
*NL*
lights
,
though
there
are
plenty
of
them
here
as
elsewhere
.
I
say
,
they
*NL*
came
in
with
the
mixed
stuffs
that
will
neither
wash
nor
wear
.
It
was
*NL*
not
so
in
my
youth
:
a
Churchman
was
a
Churchman
,
and
a
clergyman
,
you
*NL*
might
be
pretty
sure

was
a
gentleman

nothing

now
he

be
no
better
than
a

want
to
push
aside

doctrine

But
whoever
may
wish
to
push
him
aside

I
am
*NL*
proud
to
say

Mr.
Lydgate

that
he
will
compare
with
any
preacher
in

this
kingdom

not
to
speak
of
this
town

which
is
but
a
low
standard
to
*NL*
go
by
;
at

,
to
my
thinking

for
I
was
born

bred
at
Exeter

*NL*
*NL*
``
A

is
never
partial

said
Mr.

,
smiling
.
``

confidence

Mr.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

Camden
!

said
Miss
Winifred
,
``
Griffin
and
his

told
me
only
*NL*
to-day

that
Mr.

should
have
no
more
coals
if
they
came
*NL*
to
hear
you
preach

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Farebrother
laid
down
her
knitting
,
which
she
had
resumed
after
*NL*
her
small
allowance
of
tea
and
toast
,
and
looked
at
her
son
as
if
to
*NL*
say
``
You
hear

''
Miss
Noble
said
,
``
Oh
poor
things
!
poor
things
!
''
*NL*
in
reference
,
probably
,
to
the
double
loss
of
preaching
and
coal
.
But
*NL*
the
Vicar
answered
quietly
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
because
they
are
not
my
parishioners

And
I
do
n't
think

*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.

said
Mrs.
Farebrother
,
who
could
not
let
this
pass
,
``
you
*NL*
do
n't
know
my

he
always
undervalues
himself

I
tell
him
he
is
*NL*
undervaluing
the
God
who
made
him
,
and
made
him
a
most
excellent
*NL*
preacher
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
must
be
a
hint
for
me
to
take
Mr.
Lydgate
away
to
my
study

*NL*
mother

''
said
the
Vicar
,
laughing
.
``
I
promised
to
show
you
my
*NL*
collection

''
he
added
,
turning
to
Lydgate
;
``
shall
we
go
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
three
ladies
remonstrated
.
Mr.
Lydgate
ought
not
to
be
hurried
*NL*
away
without
being
allowed
to
accept
another
cup
of
tea
:
Miss
Winifred
*NL*
had
abundance
of
good
tea
in
the
pot
.
Why
was
Camden
in
such
haste
to
*NL*
take
a
visitor
to
his
den
?
There
was
nothing
but
pickled
vermin
,
and
*NL*
drawers
full
of
blue-bottles
and
moths
,
with
no
carpet
on
the
floor
.
*NL*
Mr.
Lydgate
must
excuse
it
.
A
game
at
cribbage
would
be
far
better
.
*NL*
In
short
,
it
was
plain
that
a
vicar
might
be
adored
by
his
womankind
as
*NL*
the
king
of
men
and
preachers
,
and
yet
be
held
by
them
to
stand
in
much
*NL*
need
of
their
direction
.
Lydgate
,
with
the
usual
shallowness
of
a
*NL*
young
bachelor
,
wondered
that
Mr.
Farebrother
had
not
taught
them
*NL*
better
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
mother
is
not
used
to
my
having
visitors
who
can
take
any
interest
*NL*
in
my
hobbies
,
''
said
the
Vicar
,
as
he
opened
the
door
of
his
study
,
*NL*
which
was
indeed
as
bare
of
luxuries
for
the
body
as
the
ladies
had
*NL*
implied
,
unless
a
short
porcelain
pipe
and
a
tobacco-box
were
to
be
*NL*
excepted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Men
of
your
profession
do
n't
generally
smoke
,
''
he
said
.
Lydgate
*NL*
smiled
and
shook
his
head
.
``
Nor
of
mine
either
,
properly
,
I
suppose
.
*NL*
You
will
hear
that
pipe
alleged
against
me
by
Bulstrode
and
Company
.
*NL*
They
do
n't
know
how
pleased
the
devil
would
be
if
I
gave
it
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
understand
.
You
are
of
an
excitable
temper
and
want
a
sedative
.
I
*NL*
am
heavier
,
and
should
get
idle
with
it
.
I
should
rush
into
idleness
,
*NL*
and
stagnate
there
with
all
my
might
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
mean
to
give
it
all
to
your
work

I
am
some
ten
or
twelve
*NL*
years
older
than
you
,
and
have
come
to
a
compromise
.
I
feed
a
weakness
*NL*
or
two
lest
they
should
get
clamorous
.
See

''
continued
the
Vicar
,
*NL*
opening
several
small
drawers
,
``
I
fancy
I
have
made
an
exhaustive
study
*NL*
of
the
entomology
of
this
district
.
I
am
going
on
both
with
the
fauna
*NL*
and
flora
;
but
I
have
at
least
done
my
insects
well
.
We
are
singularly
*NL*
rich
in
orthoptera
:
I
do
n't
know
whether
--
Ah
!
you
have
got
hold
of
that
*NL*
glass
jar
--
you
are
looking
into
that
instead
of
my
drawers

You
do
n't

really
care
about
these
things
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
by
the
side
of
this
lovely
anencephalous
monster
.
I
have
never
*NL*
had
time
to
give
myself
much
to
natural
history
.
I
was
early
bitten
*NL*
with
an
interest
in
structure
,
and
it
is
what
lies
most
directly
in
my
*NL*
profession
.
I
have
no
hobby
besides
.
I
have
the
sea
to
swim
in
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
you
are
a
happy
fellow
,
''
said
Mr.
Farebrother
,
turning
on
his
heel
*NL*
and
beginning
to
fill
his
pipe
.
``
You
do
n't
know
what
it
is
to
want
*NL*
spiritual
tobacco
--
bad
emendations
of
old
texts
,
or
small
items
about
a
*NL*
variety
of
Aphis
Brassicae
,
with
the
well-known
signature
of
*NL*
Philomicron
,
for
the
`
Twaddler
's
Magazine
;
'
or
a
learned
treatise
on
*NL*
the
entomology
of
the
Pentateuch
,
including
all
the
insects
not
*NL*
mentioned
,
but
probably
met
with
by
the
Israelites
in
their
passage
*NL*
through
the
desert
;
with
a
monograph
on
the
Ant
,
as
treated
by
Solomon
,
*NL*
showing
the
harmony
of
the
Book
of
Proverbs
with
the
results
of
modern
*NL*
research
.
You
do
n't
mind
my
fumigating
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lydgate
was
more
surprised
at
the
openness
of
this
talk
than
at
its
*NL*
implied
meaning
--
that
the
Vicar
felt
himself
not
altogether
in
the
*NL*
right
vocation
.
The
neat
fitting-up
of
drawers
and
shelves
,
and
the
*NL*
bookcase
filled
with
expensive
illustrated
books
on
Natural
History
,
*NL*
made
him
think
again
of
the
winnings
at
cards
and
their
destination
.
*NL*
But
he
was
beginning
to
wish
that
the
very
best
construction
of
*NL*
everything
that
Mr.
Farebrother
did
should
be
the
true
one
.
The
*NL*
Vicar
's
frankness
seemed
not
of
the
repulsive
sort
that
comes
from
an
*NL*
uneasy
consciousness
seeking
to
forestall
the
judgment
of
others
,
but
*NL*
simply
the
relief
of
a
desire
to
do
with
as
little
pretence
as
*NL*
possible
.
Apparently
he
was
not
without
a
sense
that
his
freedom
of
*NL*
speech
might
seem
premature
,
for
he
presently
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
not
yet
told
you
that
I
have
the
advantage
of
you
,
Mr.
Lydgate
,
*NL*
and
know
you
better
than
you
know
me
.
You
remember
Trawley
who
shared
*NL*
your
apartment
at
Paris
for
some
time
?
I
was
a
correspondent
of
his
,
*NL*
and
he
told
me
a
good
deal
about
you
.
I
was
not
quite
sure
when
you
*NL*
first
came
that
you
were
the
same
man
.
I
was
very
glad
when
I
found
*NL*
that
you
were
.
Only
I
do
n't
forget
that
you
have
not
had
the
like
*NL*
prologue
about
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lydgate
divined
some
delicacy
of
feeling
here
,
but
did
not
half
*NL*
understand
it
.
``
By
the
way
,
''
he
said
,
``
what
has
become
of
Trawley
?
I
*NL*
have
quite
lost
sight
of
him
.
He
was
hot
on
the
French
social
systems
,
*NL*
and
talked
of
going
to
the
Backwoods
to
found
a
sort
of
Pythagorean
*NL*
community
.
Is
he
gone
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all
.
He
is
practising
at
a
German
bath
,
and
has
married
a
rich
*NL*
patient
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
my
notions
wear
the
best
,
so
far
,
''
said
Lydgate
,
with
a
short
*NL*
scornful
laugh
.
``
He
would
have
it
,
the
medical
profession
was
an
*NL*
inevitable
system
of
humbug
.
I
said
,
the
fault
was
in
the
men
--
men
who
*NL*
truckle
to
lies
and
folly
.
Instead
of
preaching
against
humbug
outside
*NL*
the
walls
,
it
might
be
better
to
set
up
a
disinfecting
apparatus
*NL*
within
.
In
short
--
I
am
reporting
my
own
conversation
--
you
may
be
sure
*NL*
I
had
all
the
good
sense
on
my
side

*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
scheme

a
good

more
difficult

carry
out

not
only
got
the
old
Adam

yourself

you

you
have
got
all
those

the
*NL*
original
Adam

around

see

twelve

thirteen
years
more

my
knowledge
of

difficulties

But

--
Mr.
Farebrother
broke
off
a
moment
,
and
then
*NL*
added
,
``
you
are
eying

about
*NL*
all
my
new

''
The
Vicar
,
while
he
talked
in
this
way
,
*NL*
alternately
moved
about
with
his
pipe
in
his
mouth
,
and
returned
to
*NL*
hang
rather
fondly
over
his
drawers
.
``
That
would
be
good
discipline
,
*NL*
you
know
,
for
a
young
doctor
who
has
to
please
his
patients
in
*NL*
Middlemarch
.
You
must
learn
to
be
bored
,
remember
.
However
,
you
shall
*NL*
have
the
monster
on
your
own
terms
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
think
men
overrate
the
necessity
for
humoring
everybody
's
*NL*
nonsense
,
till
they
get
despised
by
the
very
fools
they
humor
?
''
said
*NL*
Lydgate
,
moving
to
Mr.
Farebrother
's
side
,
and
looking
rather
absently
*NL*
at
the
insects
ranged
in
fine
gradation
,
with
names
subscribed
in
*NL*
exquisite
writing
.
``
The
shortest
way
is
to
make
your
value
felt
,
so
*NL*
that
people
must
put
up
with
you
whether
you
flatter
them
or
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
all
my
heart
.
But
then
you
must
be
sure
of
having
the
value
,
and
*NL*
you
must
keep
yourself
independent
.
Very
few
men
can
do
that
.
Either
*NL*
you
slip
out
of
service
altogether
,
and
become
good
for
nothing
,
or
you
*NL*
wear
the
harness
and
draw
a
good
deal
where
your
yoke-fellows
pull
you
.
*NL*
But
do
look
at
these
delicate
orthoptera
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lydgate
had
after
all
to
give
some
scrutiny
to
each
drawer
,
the
Vicar
*NL*
laughing
at
himself
,
and
yet
persisting
in
the
exhibition
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Apropos
of
what
you
said
about
wearing
harness
,
''
Lydgate
began
,
after
*NL*
they
had
sat
down
,
``
I
made
up
my
mind
some
time
ago
to
do
with
as
*NL*
little
of
it
as
possible
.
That
was
why
I
determined
not
to
try
anything
*NL*
in
London
,
for
a
good
many
years
at
least
.
I
did
n't
like
what
I
saw
*NL*
when
I
was
studying
there
--
so
much
empty
bigwiggism
,
and
obstructive
*NL*
trickery
.
In
the
country
,
people
have
less
pretension
to
knowledge
,
*NL*
and
are
less
of
companions
,
but
for
that
reason
they
affect
one
's
*NL*
amour-propre
less
:
one
makes
less
bad
blood
,
and
can
follow
one
's
own
*NL*
course
more
quietly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
well
--
you
have
got
a
good
start
;
you
are
in
the
right
profession
,
*NL*
the
work
you
feel
yourself
most
fit
for
.
Some
people
miss
that
,
and
*NL*
repent
too
late
.
But
you
must
not
be
too
sure
of
keeping
your
*NL*
independence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
mean
of
family
ties
?
''
said
Lydgate
,
conceiving
that
these
might
*NL*
press
rather
tightly
on
Mr.
Farebrother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
altogether
.
Of
course
they
make
many
things
more
difficult
.
But
*NL*
a
good
wife
--
a
good
unworldly
woman
--
may
really
help
a
man
,
and
keep
*NL*
him
more
independent
.
There
's
a
parishioner
of
mine
--
a
fine
fellow
,
*NL*
but
who
would
hardly
have
pulled
through
as
he
has
done
without
his
*NL*
wife
.
Do
you
know
the
Garths
?
I
think
they
were
not
Peacock
's
*NL*
patients
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
but
there
is
a
Miss
Garth
at
old
Featherstone
's
,
at
Lowick
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Their
daughter
:
an
excellent
girl
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
very
quiet
--
I
have
hardly
noticed
her
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
She
has
taken
notice
of
you
,
though
,
depend
upon
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
understand
,
''
said
Lydgate
;
he
could
hardly
say
``
Of
course
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
she
gauges
everybody
.
I
prepared
her
for
confirmation
--
she
is
a
*NL*
favorite
of
mine

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Farebrother
puffed
a
few
moments
in
silence
,
Lydgate
not
caring
to
*NL*
know
more
about
the
Garths
.
At
last
the
Vicar
laid
down
his
pipe
,
*NL*
stretched
out
his
legs
,
and
turned
his
bright
eyes
with
a
smile
towards
*NL*
Lydgate
,
saying
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
we
Middlemarchers
are
not
so
tame
as
you
take
us
to
be
.
We
have
*NL*
our
intrigues
and
our
parties
.
I
am
a
party
man
,
for
example
,
and
*NL*
Bulstrode
is
another
.
If
you
vote
for
me
you
will
offend
Bulstrode
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
there
against
Bulstrode
?
''
said
Lydgate
,
emphatically
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
not
say
there
was
anything
against
him
except
that
.
If
you
vote
*NL*
against
him
you
will
make
him
your
enemy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
that
I
need
mind
about
that
,
''
said
Lydgate
,
rather
*NL*
proudly
;
``
but
he
seems
to
have
good
ideas
about
hospitals
,
and
he
*NL*
spends
large
sums
on
useful
public
objects
.
He
might
help
me
a
good
*NL*
deal
in
carrying
out
my
ideas
.
As
to
his
religious
notions
--
why
,
as
*NL*
Voltaire
said
,
incantations
will
destroy
a
flock
of
sheep
if
*NL*
administered
with
a
certain
quantity
of
arsenic
.
I
look
for
the
man
*NL*
who
will
bring
the
arsenic
,
and
do
n't
mind
about
his
incantations
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
good
.
But
then
you
must
not
offend
your
arsenic-man
.
You
will
*NL*
not
offend
me
,
you
know
,
''
said
Mr.
Farebrother
,
quite
unaffectedly
.
``
I
*NL*
do
n't
translate
my
own
convenience
into
other
people
's
duties
.
I
am
*NL*
opposed
to
Bulstrode
in
many
ways
.
I
do
n't
like
the
set
he
belongs
to
:
*NL*
they
are
a
narrow
ignorant
set
,
and
do
more
to
make
their
neighbors
*NL*
uncomfortable
than
to
make
them
better
.
Their
system
is
a
sort
of
*NL*
worldly-spiritual
cliqueism
:
they
really
look
on
the
rest
of
mankind
as
*NL*
a
doomed
carcass
which
is
to
nourish
them
for
heaven
.
But
,
''
he
added
,
*NL*
smilingly
,
``
I
do
n't
say
that
Bulstrode
's
new
hospital
is
a
bad
thing
;
*NL*
and
as
to
his
wanting
to
oust
me
from
the
old
one
--
why
,
if
he
thinks
me
*NL*
a
mischievous
fellow
,
he
is
only
returning
a
compliment
.
And
I
am
not
*NL*
a
model
clergyman
--
only
a
decent
makeshift
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lydgate
was
not
at
all
sure
that
the
Vicar
maligned
himself
.
A
model
*NL*
clergyman
,
like
a
model
doctor
,
ought
to
think
his
own
profession
the
*NL*
finest
in
the
world
,
and
take
all
knowledge
as
mere
nourishment
to
his
*NL*
moral
pathology
and
therapeutics
.
He
only
said
,
``
What
reason
does
*NL*
Bulstrode
give
for
superseding
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
I
do
n't
teach
his
opinions
--
which
he
calls
spiritual
religion
;
*NL*
and
that
I
have
no
time
to
spare
.
Both
statements
are
true
.
But
then
*NL*
I
could
make
time
,
and
I
should
be
glad
of
the
forty
pounds
.
That
is
*NL*
the
plain
fact
of
the
case
.
But
let
us
dismiss
it
.
I
only
wanted
to
*NL*
tell
you
that
if
you
vote
for
your
arsenic-man
,
you
are
not
to
cut
me
*NL*
in
consequence
.
I
ca
n't
spare
you
.
You
are
a
sort
of
circumnavigator
*NL*
come
to
settle
among
us
,
and
will
keep
up
my
belief
in
the
antipodes

''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Some
weeks
passed
after
this
conversation
before
the
question
of
the
*NL*
chaplaincy
gathered
any
practical
import
for
Lydgate
,
and
without
*NL*
telling
himself
the
reason
,
he
deferred
the
predetermination
on
which
*NL*
side
he
should
give
his
vote
.
It
would
really
have
been
a
matter
of
*NL*
total
indifference
to
him
--
that
is
to
say
,
he
would
have
taken
the
more
*NL*
convenient
side
,
and
given
his
vote
for
the
appointment
of
Tyke
without
*NL*
any
hesitation
--
if
he
had
not
cared
personally
for
Mr.
Farebrother
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
his
liking
for
the
Vicar
of
St.
Botolph
's
grew
with
growing
*NL*
acquaintanceship
.
That
,
entering
into
Lydgate
's
position
as
a
*NL*
new-comer
who
had
his
own
professional
objects
to
secure
,
Mr.
*NL*
Farebrother
should
have
taken
pains
rather
to
warn
off
than
to
obtain
*NL*
his
interest
,
showed
an
unusual
delicacy
and
generosity
,
which
*NL*
Lydgate
's
nature
was
keenly
alive
to
.
It
went
along
with
other
points
*NL*
of
conduct
in
Mr.
Farebrother
which
were
exceptionally
fine
,
and
made
*NL*
his
character
resemble
those
southern
landscapes
which
seem
divided
*NL*
between
natural
grandeur
and
social
slovenliness
.
Very
few
men
could
*NL*
have
been
as
filial
and
chivalrous
as
he
was
to
the
mother
,
aunt
,
and
*NL*
sister
,
whose
dependence
on
him
had
in
many
ways
shaped
his
life
rather
*NL*
uneasily
for
himself
;
few
men
who
feel
the
pressure
of
small
needs
are
*NL*
so
nobly
resolute
not
to
dress
up
their
inevitably
self-interested
*NL*
desires
in
a
pretext
of
better
motives
.
In
these
matters
he
was
*NL*
conscious
that
his
life
would
bear
the
closest
scrutiny
;
and
perhaps
*NL*
the
consciousness
encouraged
a
little
defiance
towards
the
critical
*NL*
strictness
of
persons
whose
celestial
intimacies
seemed
not
to
improve
*NL*
their
domestic
manners
,
and
whose
lofty
aims
were
not
needed
to
account
*NL*
for
their
actions
.
Then
,
his
preaching
was
ingenious
and
pithy
,
like
*NL*
the
preaching
of
the
English
Church
in
its
robust
age
,
and
his
sermons
*NL*
were
delivered
without
book
.
People
outside
his
parish
went
to
hear
*NL*
him
;
and
,
since
to
fill
the
church
was
always
the
most
difficult
part
*NL*
of
a
clergyman
's
function
,
here
was
another
ground
for
a
careless
sense
*NL*
of
superiority
.
Besides
,
he
was
a
likable
man
:
sweet-tempered
,
*NL*
ready-witted
,
frank
,
without
grins
of
suppressed
bitterness
or
other
*NL*
conversational
flavors
which
make
half
of
us
an
affliction
to
our
*NL*
friends
.
Lydgate
liked
him
heartily
,
and
wished
for
his
friendship
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
this
feeling
uppermost
,
he
continued
to
waive
the
question
of
the
*NL*
chaplaincy
,
and
to
persuade
himself
that
it
was
not
only
no
proper
*NL*
business
of
his
,
but
likely
enough
never
to
vex
him
with
a
demand
for
*NL*
his
vote
.
Lydgate
,
at
Mr.
Bulstrode
's
request
,
was
laying
down
plans
*NL*
for
the
internal
arrangements
of
the
new
hospital
,
and
the
two
were
*NL*
often
in
consultation
.
The
banker
was
always
presupposing
that
he
*NL*
could
count
in
general
on
Lydgate
as
a
coadjutor
,
but
made
no
special
*NL*
recurrence
to
the
coming
decision
between
Tyke
and
Farebrother
.
When
*NL*
the
General
Board
of
the
Infirmary
had
met
,
however
,
and
Lydgate
had
*NL*
notice
that
the
question
of
the
chaplaincy
was
thrown
on
a
council
of
*NL*
the
directors
and
medical
men
,
to
meet
on
the
following
Friday
,
he
had
*NL*
a
vexed
sense
that
he
must
make
up
his
mind
on
this
trivial
Middlemarch
*NL*
business
.
He
could
not
help
hearing
within
him
the
distinct
*NL*
declaration
that
Bulstrode
was
prime
minister
,
and
that
the
Tyke
affair
*NL*
was
a
question
of
office
or
no
office
;
and
he
could
not
help
an
equally
*NL*
pronounced
dislike
to
giving
up
the
prospect
of
office
.
For
his
*NL*
observation
was
constantly
confirming
Mr.
Farebrother
's
assurance
that
*NL*
the
banker
would
not
overlook
opposition
.
``
Confound
their
petty
*NL*
politics
!
''
was
one
of
his
thoughts
for
three
mornings
in
the
meditative
*NL*
process
of
shaving
,
when
he
had
begun
to
feel
that
he
must
really
hold
*NL*
a
court
of
conscience
on
this
matter
.
Certainly
there
were
valid
*NL*
things
to
be
said
against
the
election
of
Mr.
Farebrother
:
he
had
too
*NL*
much
on
his
hands
already
,
especially
considering
how
much
time
he
*NL*
spent
on
non-clerical
occupations
.
Then
again
it
was
a
continually
*NL*
repeated
shock
,
disturbing
Lydgate
's
esteem
,
that
the
Vicar
should
*NL*
obviously
play
for
the
sake
of
money
,
liking
the
play
indeed
,
but
*NL*
evidently
liking
some
end
which
it
served
.
Mr.
Farebrother
contended
*NL*
on
theory
for
the
desirability
of
all
games
,
and
said
that
Englishmen
's
*NL*
wit
was
stagnant
for
want
of
them
;
but
Lydgate
felt
certain
that
he
*NL*
would
have
played
very
much
less
but
for
the
money
.
There
was
a
*NL*
billiard-room
at
the
Green
Dragon
,
which
some
anxious
mothers
and
wives
*NL*
regarded
as
the
chief
temptation
in
Middlemarch
.
The
Vicar
was
a
*NL*
first-rate
billiard-player
,
and
though
he
did
not
frequent
the
Green
*NL*
Dragon
,
there
were
reports
that
he
had
sometimes
been
there
in
the
*NL*
daytime
and
had
won
money
.
And
as
to
the
chaplaincy
,
he
did
not
*NL*
pretend
that
he
cared
for
it
,
except
for
the
sake
of
the
forty
pounds
.
*NL*
Lydgate
was
no
Puritan
,
but
he
did
not
care
for
play
,
and
winning
money
*NL*
at
it
had
always
seemed
a
meanness
to
him
;
besides
,
he
had
an
ideal
of
*NL*
life
which
made
this
subservience
of
conduct
to
the
gaining
of
small
*NL*
sums
thoroughly
hateful
to
him
.
Hitherto
in
his
own
life
his
wants
had
*NL*
been
supplied
without
any
trouble
to
himself
,
and
his
first
impulse
was
*NL*
always
to
be
liberal
with
half-crowns
as
matters
of
no
importance
to
a
*NL*
gentleman
;
it
had
never
occurred
to
him
to
devise
a
plan
for
getting
*NL*
half-crowns
.
He
had
always
known
in
a
general
way
that
he
was
not
*NL*
rich
,
but
he
had
never
felt
poor
,
and
he
had
no
power
of
imagining
the
*NL*
part
which
the
want
of
money
plays
in
determining
the
actions
of
men
.
*NL*
Money
had
never
been
a
motive
to
him
.
Hence
he
was
not
ready
to
frame
*NL*
excuses
for
this
deliberate
pursuit
of
small
gains
.
It
was
altogether
*NL*
repulsive
to
him
,
and
he
never
entered
into
any
calculation
of
the
*NL*
ratio
between
the
Vicar
's
income
and
his
more
or
less
necessary
*NL*
expenditure
.
It
was
possible
that
he
would
not
have
made
such
a
*NL*
calculation
in
his
own
case
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
,
when
the
question
of
voting
had
come
,
this
repulsive
fact
told
*NL*
more
strongly
against
Mr.
Farebrother
than
it
had
done
before
.
One
*NL*
would
know
much
better
what
to
do
if
men
's
characters
were
more
*NL*
consistent
,
and
especially
if
one
's
friends
were
invariably
fit
for
any
*NL*
function
they
desired
to
undertake
!
Lydgate
was
convinced
that
if
*NL*
there
had
been
no
valid
objection
to
Mr.
Farebrother
,
he
would
have
*NL*
voted
for
him
,
whatever
Bulstrode
might
have
felt
on
the
subject
:
he
*NL*
did
not
intend
to
be
a
vassal
of
Bulstrode
's
.
On
the
other
hand
,
there
*NL*
was
Tyke
,
a
man
entirely
given
to
his
clerical
office
,
who
was
simply
*NL*
curate
at
a
chapel
of
ease
in
St.
Peter
's
parish
,
and
had
time
for
*NL*
extra
duty
.
Nobody
had
anything
to
say
against
Mr.
Tyke
,
except
that
*NL*
they
could
not
bear
him
,
and
suspected
him
of
cant
.
Really
,
from
his
*NL*
point
of
view
,
Bulstrode
was
thoroughly
justified
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
whichever
way
Lydgate
began
to
incline
,
there
was
something
to
make
*NL*
him
wince
;
and
being
a
proud
man
,
he
was
a
little
exasperated
at
being
*NL*
obliged
to
wince
.
He
did
not
like
frustrating
his
own
best
purposes
by
*NL*
getting
on
bad
terms
with
Bulstrode
;
he
did
not
like
voting
against
*NL*
Farebrother
,
and
helping
to
deprive
him
of
function
and
salary
;
and
the
*NL*
question
occurred
whether
the
additional
forty
pounds
might
not
leave
*NL*
the
Vicar
free
from
that
ignoble
care
about
winning
at
cards
.
*NL*
Moreover
,
Lydgate
did
not
like
the
consciousness
that
in
voting
for
*NL*
Tyke
he
should
be
voting
on
the
side
obviously
convenient
for
himself
.
*NL*
But
would
the
end
really
be
his
own
convenience
?
Other
people
would
*NL*
say
so
,
and
would
allege
that
he
was
currying
favor
with
Bulstrode
for
*NL*
the
sake
of
making
himself
important
and
getting
on
in
the
world
.
What
*NL*
then
?
He
for
his
own
part
knew
that
if
his
personal
prospects
simply
*NL*
had
been
concerned
,
he
would
not
have
cared
a
rotten
nut
for
the
*NL*
banker
's
friendship
or
enmity
.
What
he
really
cared
for
was
a
medium
*NL*
for
his
work
,
a
vehicle
for
his
ideas
;
and
after
all
,
was
he
not
bound
*NL*
to
prefer
the
object
of
getting
a
good
hospital
,
where
he
could
*NL*
demonstrate
the
specific
distinctions
of
fever
and
test
therapeutic
*NL*
results
,
before
anything
else
connected
with
this
chaplaincy
?
For
the
*NL*
first
time
Lydgate
was
feeling
the
hampering
threadlike
pressure
of
*NL*
small
social
conditions
,
and
their
frustrating
complexity
.
At
the
end
*NL*
of
his
inward
debate
,
when
he
set
out
for
the
hospital
,
his
hope
was
*NL*
really
in
the
chance
that
discussion
might
somehow
give
a
new
aspect
to
*NL*
the
question
,
and
make
the
scale
dip
so
as
to
exclude
the
necessity
for
*NL*
voting
.
I
think
he
trusted
a
little
also
to
the
energy
which
is
*NL*
begotten
by
circumstances
--
some
feeling
rushing
warmly
and
making
*NL*
resolve
easy
,
while
debate
in
cool
blood
had
only
made
it
more
*NL*
difficult
.
However
it
was
,
he
did
not
distinctly
say
to
himself
on
*NL*
which
side
he
would
vote
;
and
all
the
while
he
was
inwardly
resenting
*NL*
the
subjection
which
had
been
forced
upon
him
.
It
would
have
seemed
*NL*
beforehand
like
a
ridiculous
piece
of
bad
logic
that
he
,
with
his
*NL*
unmixed
resolutions
of
independence
and
his
select
purposes
,
would
find
*NL*
himself
at
the
very
outset
in
the
grasp
of
petty
alternatives
,
each
of
*NL*
which
was
repugnant
to
him
.
In
his
student
's
chambers
,
he
had
*NL*
prearranged
his
social
action
quite
differently
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lydgate
was
late
in
setting
out
,
but
Dr.
Sprague
,
the
two
other
*NL*
surgeons
,
and
several
of
the
directors
had
arrived
early
;
Mr.
*NL*
Bulstrode
,
treasurer
and
chairman
,
being
among
those
who
were
still
*NL*
absent
.
The
conversation
seemed
to
imply
that
the
issue
was
*NL*
problematical
,
and
that
a
majority
for
Tyke
was
not
so
certain
as
had
*NL*
been
generally
supposed
.
The
two
physicians
,
for
a
wonder
,
turned
out
*NL*
to
be
unanimous
,
or
rather
,
though
of
different
minds
,
they
concurred
*NL*
in
action
.
Dr.
Sprague
,
the
rugged
and
weighty
,
was
,
as
every
one
had
*NL*
foreseen
,
an
adherent
of
Mr.
Farebrother
.
The
Doctor
was
more
than
*NL*
suspected
of
having
no
religion
,
but
somehow
Middlemarch
tolerated
this
*NL*
deficiency
in
him
as
if
he
had
been
a
Lord
Chancellor
;
indeed
it
is
*NL*
probable
that
his
professional
weight
was
the
more
believed
in
,
the
*NL*
world-old
association
of
cleverness
with
the
evil
principle
being
still
*NL*
potent
in
the
minds
even
of
lady-patients
who
had
the
strictest
ideas
*NL*
of
frilling
and
sentiment
.
It
was
perhaps
this
negation
in
the
Doctor
*NL*
which
made
his
neighbors
call
him
hard-headed
and
dry-witted
;
*NL*
conditions
of
texture
which
were
also
held
favorable
to
the
storing
of
*NL*
judgments
connected
with
drugs
.
At
all
events
,
it
is
certain
that
if
*NL*
any
medical
man
had
come
to
Middlemarch
with
the
reputation
of
having
*NL*
very
definite
religious
views
,
of
being
given
to
prayer
,
and
of
*NL*
otherwise
showing
an
active
piety
,
there
would
have
been
a
general
*NL*
presumption
against
his
medical
skill
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
this
ground
it
was
-LRB-
professionally
speaking
-RRB-
fortunate
for
Dr.
*NL*
Minchin
that
his
religious
sympathies
were
of
a
general
kind
,
and
such
*NL*
as
gave
a
distant
medical
sanction
to
all
serious
sentiment
,
whether
of
*NL*
Church
or
Dissent
,
rather
than
any
adhesion
to
particular
tenets
.
If
*NL*
Mr.
Bulstrode
insisted
,
as
he
was
apt
to
do
,
on
the
Lutheran
doctrine
*NL*
of
justification
,
as
that
by
which
a
Church
must
stand
or
fall
,
Dr.
*NL*
Minchin
in
return
was
quite
sure
that
man
was
not
a
mere
machine
or
a
*NL*
fortuitous
conjunction
of
atoms
;
if
Mrs.
Wimple
insisted
on
a
*NL*
particular
providence
in
relation
to
her
stomach
complaint
,
Dr.
Minchin
*NL*
for
his
part
liked
to
keep
the
mental
windows
open
and
objected
to
*NL*
fixed
limits
;
if
the
Unitarian
brewer
jested
about
the
Athanasian
*NL*
Creed
,
Dr.
Minchin
quoted
Pope
's
``
Essay
on
Man
.
''
He
objected
to
the
*NL*
rather
free
style
of
anecdote
in
which
Dr.
Sprague
indulged
,
preferring
*NL*
well-sanctioned
quotations
,
and
liking
refinement
of
all
kinds
:
it
was
*NL*
generally
known
that
he
had
some
kinship
to
a
bishop
,
and
sometimes
*NL*
spent
his
holidays
at
``
the
palace
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dr.
Minchin
was
soft-handed
,
pale-complexioned
,
and
of
rounded
outline
,
*NL*
not
to
be
distinguished
from
a
mild
clergyman
in
appearance
:
whereas
*NL*
Dr.
Sprague
was
superfluously
tall
;
his
trousers
got
creased
at
the
*NL*
knees
,
and
showed
an
excess
of
boot
at
a
time
when
straps
seemed
*NL*
necessary
to
any
dignity
of
bearing
;
you
heard
him
go
in
and
out
,
and
*NL*
up
and
down
,
as
if
he
had
come
to
see
after
the
roofing
.
In
short
,
he
*NL*
had
weight
,
and
might
be
expected
to
grapple
with
a
disease
and
throw
*NL*
it
;
while
Dr.
Minchin
might
be
better
able
to
detect
it
lurking
and
to
*NL*
circumvent
it
.
They
enjoyed
about
equally
the
mysterious
privilege
of
*NL*
medical
reputation
,
and
concealed
with
much
etiquette
their
contempt
*NL*
for
each
other
's
skill
.
Regarding
themselves
as
Middlemarch
*NL*
institutions
,
they
were
ready
to
combine
against
all
innovators
,
and
*NL*
against
non-professionals
given
to
interference
.
On
this
ground
they
*NL*
were
both
in
their
hearts
equally
averse
to
Mr.
Bulstrode
,
though
Dr.
*NL*
Minchin
had
never
been
in
open
hostility
with
him
,
and
never
differed
*NL*
from
him
without
elaborate
explanation
to
Mrs.
Bulstrode
,
who
had
found
*NL*
that
Dr.
Minchin
alone
understood
her
constitution
.
A
layman
who
pried
*NL*
into
the
professional
conduct
of
medical
men
,
and
was
always
obtruding
*NL*
his
reforms
,
--
though
he
was
less
directly
embarrassing
to
the
two
*NL*
physicians
than
to
the
surgeon-apothecaries
who
attended
paupers
by
*NL*
contract
,
was
nevertheless
offensive
to
the
professional
nostril
as
*NL*
such
;
and
Dr.
Minchin
shared
fully
in
the
new
pique
against
Bulstrode
,
*NL*
excited
by
his
apparent
determination
to
patronize
Lydgate
.
The
*NL*
long-established
practitioners
,
Mr.
Wrench
and
Mr.
Toller
;
were
just
*NL*
now
standing
apart
and
having
a
friendly
colloquy
,
in
which
they
agreed
*NL*
that
Lydgate
was
a
jackanapes
,
just
made
to
serve
Bulstrode
's
purpose
.
*NL*
To
non-medical
friends
they
had
already
concurred
in
praising
the
other
*NL*
young
practitioner
,
who
had
come
into
the
town
on
Mr.
Peacock
's
*NL*
retirement
without
further
recommendation
than
his
own
merits
and
such
*NL*
argument
for
solid
professional
acquirement
as
might
be
gathered
from
*NL*
his
having
apparently
wasted
no
time
on
other
branches
of
knowledge
.
*NL*
It
was
clear
that
Lydgate
,
by
not
dispensing
drugs
,
intended
to
cast
*NL*
imputations
on
his
equals
,
and
also
to
obscure
the
limit
between
his
*NL*
own
rank
as
a
general
practitioner
and
that
of
the
physicians
,
who
,
in
*NL*
the
interest
of
the
profession
,
felt
bound
to
maintain
its
various
*NL*
grades
,
--
especially
against
a
man
who
had
not
been
to
either
of
the
*NL*
English
universities
and
enjoyed
the
absence
of
anatomical
and
bedside
*NL*
study
there
,
but
came
with
a
libellous
pretension
to
experience
in
*NL*
Edinburgh
and
Paris
,
where
observation
might
be
abundant
indeed
,
but
*NL*
hardly
sound
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
it
happened
that
on
this
occasion
Bulstrode
became
identified
with
*NL*
Lydgate
,
and
Lydgate
with
Tyke
;
and
owing
to
this
variety
of
*NL*
interchangeable
names
for
the
chaplaincy
question
,
diverse
minds
were
*NL*
enabled
to
form
the
same
judgment
concerning
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dr.
Sprague
said
at
once
bluntly
to
the
group
assembled
when
he
*NL*
entered
,
``
I
go
for
Farebrother
.
A
salary
,
with
all
my
heart
.
But
why
*NL*
take
it
from
the
Vicar
?
He
has
none
too
much
--
has
to
insure
his
life
,
*NL*
besides
keeping
house
,
and
doing
a
vicar
's
charities
.
Put
forty
pounds
*NL*
in
his
pocket
and
you
'll
do
no
harm
.
He
's
a
good
fellow
,
is
*NL*
Farebrother
,
with
as
little
of
the
parson
about
him
as
will
serve
to
*NL*
carry
orders
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ho
,
ho
!
Doctor
,
''
said
old
Mr.
Powderell
,
a
retired
iron-monger
of
*NL*
some
standing
--
his
interjection
being
something
between
a
laugh
and
a
*NL*
Parliamentary
disapproval
;
``
we
must
let
you
have
your
say
.
But
what
we
*NL*
have
to
consider
is
not
anybody
's
income
--
it
's
the
souls
of
the
poor
*NL*
sick
people
''
--
here
Mr.
Powderell
's
voice
and
face
had
a
sincere
pathos
*NL*
in
them
.
``
He
is
a
real
Gospel
preacher
,
is
Mr.
Tyke
.
I
should
vote
*NL*
against
my
conscience
if
I
voted
against
Mr.
Tyke
--
I
should
indeed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Tyke
's
opponents
have
not
asked
any
one
to
vote
against
his
*NL*
conscience
,
I
believe
,

said
Mr.
Hackbutt
,
a
rich
tanner
of
fluent
*NL*
speech
,
whose
glittering
spectacles
and
erect
hair
were
turned
with
*NL*
some
severity
towards
innocent
Mr.
Powderell
.
``
But
in
my
judgment
it
*NL*
behoves
us
,
as
Directors
,
to
consider
whether
we
will
regard
it
as
our
*NL*
whole
business
to
carry
out
propositions
emanating
from
a
single
*NL*
quarter
.
Will
any
member
of
the
committee
aver
that
he
would
have
*NL*
entertained
the
idea
of
displacing
the
gentleman
who
has
always
*NL*
discharged
the
function
of
chaplain
here
,
if
it
had
not
been
suggested
*NL*
to
him
by
parties

disposition
it
is
to
regard
every
institution
*NL*
of
this
town
as
a
machinery
for
carrying
out

own
views

I
tax
no
*NL*
man
's
motives
:
let
them
lie
between
himself

a
higher
Power

I
*NL*
do
say
,
that
there
are
influences
at
work
here
which
are
incompatible

with
genuine
independence

that
a
crawling
servility
is
usually

dictated
by
circumstances

gentlemen
so
conducting
themselves

could
not
afford
either
morally
or
financially
to
avow

I
myself
am
a
*NL*
layman

I
have
given
no
inconsiderable
attention

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

burst
in
Mr.
Frank
Hawley
,
lawyer
and
*NL*
town-clerk
,
who
rarely
presented
himself
at
the
board
,
but
now
looked
*NL*
in
hurriedly
,
whip
in
hand
.
``

``

said

;
at
which
everybody
turned

away
from
Mr.

,
leaving
him
to
feel
the
uselessness
of
superior
*NL*
gifts
in
Middlemarch

have
you
on

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

said
Dr.
Minchin

nodding
and
shaking
hands
here
and

there
;
``
at
whatever
cost
to
my
feelings

*NL*
*NL*
``
If
there
's
any

I
think

''
said
Mr.
Frank
Hawley
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
confess
I
have
feelings
on
the
other
side
also
.
I
have
a
divided

said
Dr.
Minchin
,
rubbing
his
hands
.
``
I
consider
Mr.
Tyke
an
*NL*
exemplary
man
--
none
more
so
--
and
I
believe
him
to
be
proposed
from
*NL*
unimpeachable
motives
.
I
,
for
my
part
,
wish
that
I
could
give
him
my
*NL*
vote
.
But
I
am
constrained
to
take
a
view
of
the
case
which
gives
the
*NL*
preponderance
to
Mr.
Farebrother
's
claims
.
He
is
an
amiable
man
,
an
*NL*
able
preacher
,
and
has
been
longer
among
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Old
Mr.
Powderell
looked
on
,
sad
and
silent
.
Mr.
Plymdale
settled
his
*NL*
cravat
,
uneasily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
set
up
Farebrother
as
a
pattern
of
what
a
clergyman
ought
to
*NL*
be
,
I
hope
,
''
said
Mr.
Larcher
,
the
eminent
carrier
,
who
had
just
come
*NL*
in
.
``
I
have
no
ill-will
towards
him
,
but
I
think
we
owe
something
to
*NL*
the
public
,
not
to
speak
of
anything
higher
,
in
these
appointments
.
In
*NL*
my
opinion
Farebrother
is
too
lax
for
a
clergyman
.
I
do
n't
wish
to
*NL*
bring
up
particulars
against
him
;
but
he
will
make
a
little
attendance
*NL*
here
go
as
far
as
he
can
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
a
devilish
deal
better
than
too
much
,
''
said
Mr.
Hawley
,
whose
bad
*NL*
language
was
notorious
in
that
part
of
the
county
.
``
Sick
people
ca
n't
*NL*
bear
so
much
praying
and
preaching
.
And
that
methodistical
sort
of
*NL*
religion
is
bad
for
the
spirits
--
bad
for
the
inside
,
eh
?
''
he
added
,
*NL*
turning
quickly
round
to
the
four
medical
men
who
were
assembled
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
any
answer
was
dispensed
with
by
the
entrance
of
three
gentlemen
,
*NL*
with
whom
there
were
greetings
more
or
less
cordial
.
These
were
the
*NL*
Reverend
Edward
Thesiger
,
Rector
of
St.
Peter
's
,
Mr.
Bulstrode
,
and
our
*NL*
friend
Mr.
Brooke
of
Tipton
,
who
had
lately
allowed
himself
to
be
put
*NL*
on
the
board
of
directors
in
his
turn
,
but
had
never
before
attended
,
*NL*
his
attendance
now
being
due
to
Mr.
Bulstrode
's
exertions
.
Lydgate
was
*NL*
the
only
person
still
expected
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
one
now
sat
down
,
Mr.
Bulstrode
presiding
,
pale
and
*NL*
self-restrained
as
usual
.
Mr.
Thesiger
,
a
moderate
evangelical
,
wished
*NL*
for
the
appointment
of
his
friend
Mr.
Tyke
,
a
zealous
able
man
,
who
,
*NL*
officiating
at
a
chapel
of
ease
,
had
not
a
cure
of
souls
too
extensive
*NL*
to
leave
him
ample
time
for
the
new
duty
.
It
was
desirable
that
*NL*
chaplaincies
of
this
kind
should
be
entered
on
with
a
fervent
*NL*
intention
:
they
were
peculiar
opportunities
for
spiritual
influence
;
*NL*
and
while
it
was
good
that
a
salary
should
be
allotted
,
there
was
the
*NL*
more
need
for
scrupulous
watching
lest
the
office
should
be
perverted
*NL*
into
a
mere
question
of
salary
.
Mr.
Thesiger
's
manner
had
so
much
*NL*
quiet
propriety
that
objectors
could
only
simmer
in
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Brooke
believed
that
everybody
meant
well
in
the
matter
.
He
had
*NL*
not
himself
attended
to
the
affairs
of
the
Infirmary
,
though
he
had
a
*NL*
strong
interest
in
whatever
was
for
the
benefit
of
Middlemarch
,
and
was
*NL*
most
happy
to
meet
the
gentlemen
present
on
any
public
question
--
``
any
*NL*
public
question
,
you
know
,
''
Mr.
Brooke
repeated
,
with
his
nod
of
*NL*
perfect
understanding
.
``
I
am
a
good
deal
occupied
as
a
magistrate
,
and
*NL*
in
the
collection
of
documentary
evidence
,
but
I
regard
my
time
as
*NL*
being
at
the
disposal
of
the
public
--
and
,
in
short
,
my
friends
have
*NL*
convinced
me
that
a
chaplain
with
a
salary
--
a
salary
,
you
know
--
is
a
*NL*
very
good
thing
,
and
I
am
happy
to
be
able
to
come
here
and
vote
for
*NL*
the
appointment
of
Mr.
Tyke
,
who
,
I
understand
,
is
an
unexceptionable
*NL*
man
,
apostolic
and
eloquent
and
everything
of
that
kind
--
and
I
am
the
*NL*
last
man
to
withhold
my
vote

under
the
circumstances

you
know

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
seems
to
me
that
you
have
been
crammed
with
one
side
of
the
*NL*
question

Mr.
Brooke
,
''
said
Mr.
Frank
Hawley
,
who
was
afraid
of
nobody
,
*NL*
and
was
a
Tory
suspicious
of
electioneering
intentions
.
``
You
do
n't
*NL*
seem

one
of
the
worthiest
men
we
have
has
been
doing

as
chaplain
here
for
years
without
pay
,
and
that
Mr.
Tyke
is
proposed
*NL*
to
supersede
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excuse
me
,
Mr.
Hawley
,
''
said
Mr.
Bulstrode
.
``

By

flashed
out
Mr.

*NL*
*NL*
``

Mr.

Thesiger

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll

there

retorted
Mr.
Hawley
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gentlemen

''
said
Mr.
Bulstrode
,
in
a
subdued
tone
,
``
the
merits
of
the
*NL*
question
may
be
very
briefly
stated
,
and
if
any
one
present
doubts
that
*NL*
every
gentleman
who
is
about
to
give
his
vote
has
not
been
fully
*NL*
informed
,
I
can
now
recapitulate
the
considerations
that
should
weigh
*NL*
on
either
side
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
see
the
good
of
that
,
''
said
Mr.
Hawley
.
``
I
suppose
we
all
*NL*
know
whom
we
mean
to
vote
for
.
Any
man
who
wants
to
do
justice
does
*NL*
not
wait
till
the
last
minute
to
hear
both
sides
of
the
question
.
I
*NL*
have
no
time
to
lose
,
and
I
propose
that
the
matter
be
put
to
the
vote
*NL*
at
once
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
brief
but
still
hot
discussion
followed
before
each
person
wrote
*NL*
``
Tyke
''
or
``
Farebrother
''
on
a
piece
of
paper
and
slipped
it
into
a
glass
*NL*
tumbler
;
and
in
the
mean
time
Mr.
Bulstrode
saw
Lydgate
enter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
perceive
that
the
votes
are
equally
divided
at
present
,
''
said
Mr.
*NL*
Bulstrode
,
in
a
clear
biting
voice
.
Then
,
looking
up
at
Lydgate
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
a
casting-vote
still
to
be
given
.
It
is
yours
,
Mr.
Lydgate
:
*NL*
will
you
be
good
enough
to
write
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
thing
is
settled
now
,
''
said
Mr.
Wrench
,
rising
.
``
We
all
know
how
*NL*
Mr.
Lydgate
will
vote
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
seem
to
speak
with
some
peculiar
meaning
,
sir
,
''
said
Lydgate
,
*NL*
rather
defiantly
,
and
keeping
his
pencil
suspended
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
merely
mean
that
you
are
expected
to
vote
with
Mr.
Bulstrode
.
Do
*NL*
you
regard
that
meaning
as
offensive
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
may
be
offensive
to
others
.
But
I
shall
not
desist
from
voting
*NL*
with
him
on
that
account
.
''
Lydgate
immediately
wrote
down
``
Tyke
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
the
Rev.
Walter
Tyke
became
chaplain
to
the
Infirmary
,
and
Lydgate
*NL*
continued
to
work
with
Mr.
Bulstrode
.
He
was
really
uncertain
whether
*NL*
Tyke
were
not
the
more
suitable
candidate
,
and
yet
his
consciousness
*NL*
told
him
that
if
he
had
been
quite
free
from
indirect
bias
he
should
*NL*
have
voted
for
Mr.
Farebrother
.
The
affair
of
the
chaplaincy
remained
*NL*
a
sore
point
in
his
memory
as
a
case
in
which
this
petty
medium
of
*NL*
Middlemarch
had
been
too
strong
for
him
.
How
could
a
man
be
satisfied
*NL*
with
a
decision
between
such
alternatives
and
under
such
circumstances
?
*NL*
No
more
than
he
can
be
satisfied
with
his
hat
,
which
he
has
chosen
from
*NL*
among
such
shapes
as
the
resources
of
the
age
offer
him
,
wearing
it
at
*NL*
best
with
a
resignation
which
is
chiefly
supported
by
comparison
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Mr.
Farebrother
met
him
with
the
same
friendliness
as
before
.
The
*NL*
character
of
the
publican
and
sinner
is
not
always
practically
*NL*
incompatible
with
that
of
the
modern
Pharisee
,
for
the
majority
of
us
*NL*
scarcely
see
more
distinctly
the
faultiness
of
our
own
conduct
than
the
*NL*
faultiness
of
our
own
arguments
,
or
the
dulness
of
our
own
jokes
.
But
*NL*
the
Vicar
of
St.
Botolph
's
had
certainly
escaped
the
slightest
tincture
*NL*
of
the
Pharisee
,
and
by
dint
of
admitting
to
himself
that
he
was
too
*NL*
much
as
other
men
were
,
he
had
become
remarkably
unlike
them
in
*NL*
this
--
that
he
could
excuse
others
for
thinking
slightly
of
him
,
and
*NL*
could
judge
impartially
of
their
conduct
even
when
it
told
against
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
world
has
been
too
strong
for
_
me
_
,
I
know
,
''
he
said
one
day
to
*NL*
Lydgate
.
``
But
then
I
am
not
a
mighty
man
--
I
shall
never
be
a
man
of
*NL*
renown
.
The
choice
of
Hercules
is
a
pretty
fable
;
but
Prodicus
makes
*NL*
it
easy
work
for
the
hero
,
as
if
the
first
resolves
were
enough
.
*NL*
Another
story
says
that
he
came
to
hold
the
distaff
,
and
at
last
wore
*NL*
the
Nessus
shirt
.
I
suppose
one
good
resolve
might
keep
a
man
right
if
*NL*
everybody
else
's
resolve
helped
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Vicar
's
talk
was
not
always
inspiriting
:
he
had
escaped
being
a
*NL*
Pharisee
,
but
he
had
not
escaped
that
low
estimate
of
possibilities
*NL*
which
we
rather
hastily
arrive
at
as
an
inference
from
our
own
failure
.
*NL*
Lydgate
thought
that
there
was
a
pitiable
infirmity
of
will
in
Mr.
*NL*
Farebrother

When
George
the
Fourth
was
still
reigning
over
the
privacies
of
*NL*
Windsor
,
when
the
Duke
of
Wellington
was
Prime
Minister
,
and
Mr.
Vincy
*NL*
was
mayor
of
the
old
corporation
in
Middlemarch
,
Mrs.
Casaubon
,
born
*NL*
Dorothea
Brooke
,
had
taken
her
wedding
journey
to
Rome
.
In
those
days
*NL*
the
world
in
general
was
more
ignorant
of
good
and
evil
by
forty
years
*NL*
than
it
is
at
present
.
Travellers
did
not
often
carry
full
information
*NL*
on
Christian
art
either
in
their
heads
or
their
pockets
;
and
even
the
*NL*
most
brilliant
English
critic
of
the
day
mistook
the
flower-flushed
*NL*
tomb
of
the
ascended
Virgin
for
an
ornamental
vase
due
to
the
painter
's
*NL*
fancy
.
Romanticism
,
which
has
helped
to
fill
some
dull
blanks
with
*NL*
love
and
knowledge
,
had
not
yet
penetrated
the
times
with
its
leaven
*NL*
and
entered
into
everybody
's
food
;
it
was
fermenting
still
as
a
*NL*
distinguishable
vigorous
enthusiasm
in
certain
long-haired
German
*NL*
artists
at
Rome
,
and
the
youth
of
other
nations
who
worked
or
idled
*NL*
near
them
were
sometimes
caught
in
the
spreading
movement
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
fine
morning
a
young
man
whose
hair
was
not
immoderately
long
,
but
*NL*
abundant
and
curly
,
and
who
was
otherwise
English
in
his
equipment
,
had
*NL*
just
turned
his
back
on
the
Belvedere
Torso
in
the
Vatican
and
was
*NL*
looking
out
on
the
magnificent
view
of
the
mountains
from
the
adjoining
*NL*
round
vestibule
.
He
was
sufficiently
absorbed
not
to
notice
the
*NL*
approach
of
a
dark-eyed
,
animated
German
who
came
up
to
him
and
placing
*NL*
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
,
said
with
a
strong
accent
,
``
Come
here
,
quick
!
*NL*
else
she
will
have
changed
her
pose
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Quickness
was
ready
at
the
call
,
and
the
two
figures
passed
lightly
*NL*
along
by
the
Meleager
,
towards
the
hall
where
the
reclining
Ariadne
,
*NL*
then
called
the
Cleopatra
,
lies
in
the
marble
voluptuousness
of
her
*NL*
beauty
,
the
drapery
folding
around
her
with
a
petal-like
ease
and
*NL*
tenderness
.
They
were
just
in
time
to
see
another
figure
standing
*NL*
against
a
pedestal
near
the
reclining
marble
:
a
breathing
blooming
*NL*
girl
,
whose
form
,
not
shamed
by
the
Ariadne
,
was
clad
in
Quakerish
gray
*NL*
drapery
;
her
long
cloak
,
fastened
at
the
neck
,
was
thrown
backward
from
*NL*
her
arms
,
and
one
beautiful
ungloved
hand
pillowed
her
cheek
,
pushing
*NL*
somewhat
backward
the
white
beaver
bonnet
which
made
a
sort
of
halo
to
*NL*
her
face
around
the
simply
braided
dark-brown
hair
.
She
was
not
*NL*
looking
at
the
sculpture
,
probably
not
thinking
of
it
:
her
large
eyes
*NL*
were
fixed
dreamily
on
a
streak
of
sunlight
which
fell
across
the
*NL*
floor
.
But
she
became
conscious
of
the
two
strangers
who
suddenly
*NL*
paused
as
if
to
contemplate
the
Cleopatra
,
and
,
without
looking
at
*NL*
them
,
immediately
turned
away
to
join
a
maid-servant
and
courier
who
*NL*
were
loitering
along
the
hall
at
a
little
distance
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
think
of
that
for
a
fine
bit
of
antithesis
?
''
said
the
*NL*
German
,
searching
in
his
friend
's
face
for
responding
admiration
,
but
*NL*
going
on
volubly
without
waiting
for
any
other
answer
.
``
There
lies
*NL*
antique
beauty

not
corpse-like

in

in

here
stands
beauty
*NL*
in

life
,
with
the
consciousness
of

centuries
in

its

But
she
should
be
dressed
as
a
nun
;
I
think
she
looks
*NL*
almost
what
you
call
a
Quaker
;
I
would
dress
her
as
a
nun
in
my
*NL*
picture
.
However
,
she
is
married
;
I
saw
her
wedding-ring
on
that
*NL*
wonderful
left
hand
,
otherwise
I
should
have
thought
the
sallow
*NL*
Geistlicher
was
her
father
.
I
saw
him
parting
from
her
a
good
while
*NL*
ago
,
and
just
now
I
found
her
in
that
magnificent
pose
.
Only
think
!
he
*NL*
is
perhaps
rich
,
and
would
like
to
have
her
portrait
taken

Ah

Two
hours
later
,
Dorothea
was
seated
in
an
inner
room
or
boudoir
of
a
*NL*
handsome
apartment
in
the
Via
Sistina
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
am
sorry
to
add
that
she
was
sobbing
bitterly
,
with
such
abandonment
*NL*
to
this
relief
of
an
oppressed
heart
as
a
woman
habitually
controlled
*NL*
by
pride
on
her
own
account
and
thoughtfulness
for
others
will
*NL*
sometimes
allow
herself
when
she
feels
securely
alone
.
And
Mr.
*NL*
Casaubon
was
certain
to
remain
away
for
some
time
at
the
Vatican
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
Dorothea
had
no
distinctly
shapen
grievance
that
she
could
state
*NL*
even
to
herself
;
and
in
the
midst
of
her
confused
thought
and
passion
,
*NL*
the
mental
act
that
was
struggling
forth
into
clearness
was
a
*NL*
self-accusing
cry
that
her
feeling
of
desolation
was
the
fault
of
her
*NL*
own
spiritual
poverty
.
She
had
married
the
man
of
her
choice
,
and
with
*NL*
the
advantage
over
most
girls
that
she
had
contemplated
her
marriage
*NL*
chiefly
as
the
beginning
of
new
duties
:
from
the
very
first
she
had
*NL*
thought
of
Mr.
Casaubon
as
having
a
mind
so
much
above
her
own
,
that
he
*NL*
must
often
be
claimed
by
studies
which
she
could
not
entirely
share
;
*NL*
moreover
,
after
the
brief
narrow
experience
of
her
girlhood
she
was
*NL*
beholding
Rome
,
the
city
of
visible
history
,
where
the
past
of
a
whole
*NL*
hemisphere
seems
moving
in
funeral
procession
with
strange
ancestral
*NL*
images
and
trophies
gathered
from
afar
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
this
stupendous
fragmentariness
heightened
the
dreamlike
*NL*
strangeness
of
her
bridal
life
.
Dorothea
had
now
been
five
weeks
in
*NL*
Rome
,
and
in
the
kindly
mornings
when
autumn
and
winter
seemed
to
go
*NL*
hand
in
hand
like
a
happy
aged
couple
one
of
whom
would
presently
*NL*
survive
in
chiller
loneliness
,
she
had
driven
about
at
first
with
Mr.
*NL*
Casaubon
,
but
of
late
chiefly
with
Tantripp
and
their
experienced
*NL*
courier
.
She
had
been
led
through
the
best
galleries
,
had
been
taken
*NL*
to
the
chief
points
of
view
,
had
been
shown
the
grandest
ruins
and
the
*NL*
most
glorious
churches
,
and
she
had
ended
by
oftenest
choosing
to
drive
*NL*
out
to
the
Campagna
where
she
could
feel
alone
with
the
earth
and
sky
,
*NL*
away-from
the
oppressive
masquerade
of
ages
,
in
which
her
own
life
too
*NL*
seemed
to
become
a
masque
with
enigmatical
costumes
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
those
who
have
looked
at
Rome
with
the
quickening
power
of
a
*NL*
knowledge
which
breathes
a
growing
soul
into
all
historic
shapes
,
and
*NL*
traces
out
the
suppressed
transitions
which
unite
all
contrasts
,
Rome
*NL*
may
still
be
the
spiritual
centre
and
interpreter
of
the
world
.
But
*NL*
let
them
conceive
one
more
historical
contrast
:
the
gigantic
broken
*NL*
revelations
of
that
Imperial
and
Papal
city
thrust
abruptly
on
the
*NL*
notions
of
a
girl
who
had
been
brought
up
in
English
and
Swiss
*NL*
Puritanism
,
fed
on
meagre
Protestant
histories
and
on
art
chiefly
of
*NL*
the
hand-screen
sort
;
a
girl
whose
ardent
nature
turned
all
her
small
*NL*
allowance
of
knowledge
into
principles
,
fusing
her
actions
into
their
*NL*
mould
,
and
whose
quick
emotions
gave
the
most
abstract
things
the
*NL*
quality
of
a
pleasure
or
a
pain
;
a
girl
who
had
lately
become
a
wife
,
*NL*
and
from
the
enthusiastic
acceptance
of
untried
duty
found
herself
*NL*
plunged
in
tumultuous
preoccupation
with
her
personal
lot
.
The
weight
*NL*
of
unintelligible
Rome
might
lie
easily
on
bright
nymphs
to
whom
it
*NL*
formed
a
background
for
the
brilliant
picnic
of
Anglo-foreign
society
;
*NL*
but
Dorothea
had
no
such
defence
against
deep
impressions
.
Ruins
and
*NL*
basilicas
,
palaces
and
colossi
,
set
in
the
midst
of
a
sordid
present
,
*NL*
where
all
that
was
living
and
warm-blooded
seemed
sunk
in
the
deep
*NL*
degeneracy
of
a
superstition
divorced
from
reverence
;
the
dimmer
but
*NL*
yet
eager
Titanic
life
gazing
and
struggling
on
walls
and
ceilings
;
the
*NL*
long
vistas
of
white
forms
whose
marble
eyes
seemed
to
hold
the
*NL*
monotonous
light
of
an
alien
world
:
all
this
vast
wreck
of
ambitious
*NL*
ideals
,
sensuous
and
spiritual
,
mixed
confusedly
with
the
signs
of
*NL*
breathing
forgetfulness
and
degradation
,
at
first
jarred
her
as
with
an
*NL*
electric
shock
,
and
then
urged
themselves
on
her
with
that
ache
*NL*
belonging
to
a
glut
of
confused
ideas
which
check
the
flow
of
emotion
.
*NL*
Forms
both
pale
and
glowing
took
possession
of
her
young
sense
,
and
*NL*
fixed
themselves
in
her
memory
even
when
she
was
not
thinking
of
them
,
*NL*
preparing
strange
associations
which
remained
through
her
after-years
.
*NL*
Our
moods
are
apt
to
bring
with
them
images
which
succeed
each
other
*NL*
like
the
magic-lantern
pictures
of
a
doze
;
and
in
certain
states
of
*NL*
dull
forlornness
Dorothea
all
her
life
continued
to
see
the
vastness
of
*NL*
St.
Peter
's
,
the
huge
bronze
canopy
,
the
excited
intention
in
the
*NL*
attitudes
and
garments
of
the
prophets
and
evangelists
in
the
mosaics
*NL*
above
,
and
the
red
drapery
which
was
being
hung
for
Christmas
spreading
*NL*
itself
everywhere
like
a
disease
of
the
retina
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
that
this
inward
amazement
of
Dorothea
's
was
anything
very
*NL*
exceptional
:
many
souls
in
their
young
nudity
are
tumbled
out
among
*NL*
incongruities
and
left
to
``
find
their
feet
''
among
them
,
while
their
*NL*
elders
go
about
their
business
.
Nor
can
I
suppose
that
when
Mrs.
*NL*
Casaubon
is
discovered
in
a
fit
of
weeping
six
weeks
after
her
wedding
,
*NL*
the
situation
will
be
regarded
as
tragic
.
Some
discouragement
,
some
*NL*
faintness
of
heart
at
the
new
real
future
which
replaces
the
imaginary
,
*NL*
is
not
unusual
,
and
we
do
not
expect
people
to
be
deeply
moved
by
what
*NL*
is
not
unusual
.
That
element
of
tragedy
which
lies
in
the
very
fact
of
*NL*
frequency
,
has
not
yet
wrought
itself
into
the
coarse
emotion
of
*NL*
mankind
;
and
perhaps
our
frames
could
hardly
bear
much
of
it
.
If
we
*NL*
had
a
keen
vision
and
feeling
of
all
ordinary
human
life
,
it
would
be
*NL*
like
hearing
the
grass
grow
and
the
squirrel
's
heart
beat
,
and
we
*NL*
should
die
of
that
roar
which
lies
on
the
other
side
of
silence
.
As
it
*NL*
is
,
the
quickest
of
us
walk
about
well
wadded
with
stupidity
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
Dorothea
was
crying
,
and
if
she
had
been
required
to
state
the
*NL*
cause
,
she
could
only
have
done
so
in
some
such
general
words
as
I
have
*NL*
already
used
:
to
have
been
driven
to
be
more
particular
would
have
been
*NL*
like
trying
to
give
a
history
of
the
lights
and
shadows
,
for
that
new
*NL*
real
future
which
was
replacing
the
imaginary
drew
its
material
from
*NL*
the
endless
minutiae
by
which
her
view
of
Mr.
Casaubon
and
her
wifely
*NL*
relation
,
now
that
she
was
married
to
him
,
was
gradually
changing
with
*NL*
the
secret
motion
of
a
watch-hand
from
what
it
had
been
in
her
maiden
*NL*
dream
.
It
was
too
early
yet
for
her
fully
to
recognize
or
at
least
*NL*
admit
the
change
,
still
more
for
her
to
have
readjusted
that
*NL*
devotedness
which
was
so
necessary
a
part
of
her
mental
life
that
she
*NL*
was
almost
sure
sooner
or
later
to
recover
it
.
Permanent
rebellion
,
*NL*
the
disorder
of
a
life
without
some
loving
reverent
resolve
,
was
not
*NL*
possible
to
her
;
but
she
was
now
in
an
interval
when
the
very
force
of
*NL*
her
nature
heightened
its
confusion
.
In
this
way
,
the
early
months
of
*NL*
marriage
often
are
times
of
critical
tumult
--
whether
that
of
a
*NL*
shrimp-pool
or
of
deeper
waters
--
which
afterwards
subsides
into
*NL*
cheerful
peace
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
was
not
Mr.
Casaubon
just
as
learned
as
before
?
Had
his
forms
of
*NL*
expression
changed
,
or
his
sentiments
become
less
laudable
?
Oh
*NL*
waywardness
of
womanhood
!
did
his
chronology
fail
him
,
or
his
ability
*NL*
to
state
not
only
a
theory
but
the
names
of
those
who
held
it
;
or
his
*NL*
provision
for
giving
the
heads
of
any
subject
on
demand
?
And
was
not
*NL*
Rome
the
place
in
all
the
world
to
give
free
play
to
such
*NL*
accomplishments
?
Besides
,
had
not
Dorothea
's
enthusiasm
especially
*NL*
dwelt
on
the
prospect
of
relieving
the
weight
and
perhaps
the
sadness
*NL*
with
which
great
tasks
lie
on
him
who
has
to
achieve
them
?
--
And
that
*NL*
such
weight
pressed
on
Mr.
Casaubon
was
only
plainer
than
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
these
are
crushing
questions
;
but
whatever
else
remained
the
same
,
*NL*
the
light
had
changed
,
and
you
can
not
find
the
pearly
dawn
at
noonday
.
*NL*
The
fact
is
unalterable
,
that
a
fellow-mortal
with
whose
nature
you
are
*NL*
acquainted
solely
through
the
brief
entrances
and
exits
of
a
few
*NL*
imaginative
weeks
called
courtship
,
may
,
when
seen
in
the
continuity
of
*NL*
married
companionship
,
be
disclosed
as
something
better
or
worse
than
*NL*
what
you
have
preconceived
,
but
will
certainly
not
appear
altogether
*NL*
the
same
.
And
it
would
be
astonishing
to
find
how
soon
the
change
is
*NL*
felt
if
we
had
no
kindred
changes
to
compare
with
it
.
To
share
*NL*
lodgings
with
a
brilliant
dinner-companion
,
or
to
see
your
favorite
*NL*
politician
in
the
Ministry
,
may
bring
about
changes
quite
as
rapid
:
in
*NL*
these
cases
too
we
begin
by
knowing
little
and
believing
much
,
and
we
*NL*
sometimes
end
by
inverting
the
quantities
.
*NL*
*NL*
Still
,
such
comparisons
might
mislead
,
for
no
man
was
more
incapable
of
*NL*
flashy
make-believe
than
Mr.
Casaubon
:
he
was
as
genuine
a
character
as
*NL*
any
ruminant
animal
,
and
he
had
not
actively
assisted
in
creating
any
*NL*
illusions
about
himself
.
How
was
it
that
in
the
weeks
since
her
*NL*
marriage
,
Dorothea
had
not
distinctly
observed
but
felt
with
a
stifling
*NL*
depression
,
that
the
large
vistas
and
wide
fresh
air
which
she
had
*NL*
dreamed
of
finding
in
her
husband
's
mind
were
replaced
by
anterooms
and
*NL*
winding
passages
which
seemed
to
lead
nowhither
?
I
suppose
it
was
that
*NL*
in
courtship
everything
is
regarded
as
provisional
and
preliminary
,
and
*NL*
the
smallest
sample
of
virtue
or
accomplishment
is
taken
to
guarantee
*NL*
delightful
stores
which
the
broad
leisure
of
marriage
will
reveal
.
But
*NL*
the
door-sill
of
marriage
once
crossed
,
expectation
is
concentrated
on
*NL*
the
present
.
Having
once
embarked
on
your
marital
voyage
,
it
is
*NL*
impossible
not
to
be
aware
that
you
make
no
way
and
that
the
sea
is
not
*NL*
within
sight
--
that
,
in
fact
,
you
are
exploring
an
enclosed
basin
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
their
conversation
before
marriage
,
Mr.
Casaubon
had
often
dwelt
on
*NL*
some
explanation
or
questionable
detail
of
which
Dorothea
did
not
see
*NL*
the
bearing
;
but
such
imperfect
coherence
seemed
due
to
the
brokenness
*NL*
of
their
intercourse
,
and
,
supported
by
her
faith
in
their
future
,
she
*NL*
had
listened
with
fervid
patience
to
a
recitation
of
possible
arguments
*NL*
to
be
brought
against
Mr.
Casaubon
's
entirely
new
view
of
the
*NL*
Philistine
god
Dagon
and
other
fish-deities
,
thinking
that
hereafter
*NL*
she
should
see
this
subject
which
touched
him
so
nearly
from
the
same
*NL*
high
ground
whence
doubtless
it
had
become
so
important
to
him
.
Again
,
*NL*
the
matter-of-course
statement
and
tone
of
dismissal
with
which
he
*NL*
treated
what
to
her
were
the
most
stirring
thoughts
,
was
easily
*NL*
accounted
for
as
belonging
to
the
sense
of
haste
and
preoccupation
in
*NL*
which
she
herself
shared
during
their
engagement
.
But
now
,
since
they
*NL*
had
been
in
Rome
,
with
all
the
depths
of
her
emotion
roused
to
*NL*
tumultuous
activity
,
and
with
life
made
a
new
problem
by
new
elements
,
*NL*
she
had
been
becoming
more
and
more
aware
,
with
a
certain
terror
,
that
*NL*
her
mind
was
continually
sliding
into
inward
fits
of
anger
and
*NL*
repulsion
,
or
else
into
forlorn
weariness
.
How
far
the
judicious
*NL*
Hooker
or
any
other
hero
of
erudition
would
have
been
the
same
at
Mr.
*NL*
Casaubon
's
time
of
life
,
she
had
no
means
of
knowing
,
so
that
he
could
*NL*
not
have
the
advantage
of
comparison
;
but
her
husband
's
way
of
*NL*
commenting
on
the
strangely
impressive
objects
around
them
had
begun
to
*NL*
affect
her
with
a
sort
of
mental
shiver
:
he
had
perhaps
the
best
*NL*
intention
of
acquitting
himself
worthily
,
but
only
of
acquitting
*NL*
himself
.
What
was
fresh
to
her
mind
was
worn
out
to
his
;
and
such
*NL*
capacity
of
thought
and
feeling
as
had
ever
been
stimulated
in
him
by
*NL*
the
general
life
of
mankind
had
long
shrunk
to
a
sort
of
dried
*NL*
preparation
,
a
lifeless
embalmment
of
knowledge
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
said
,
``
Does
this
interest
you
,
Dorothea
?
Shall
we
stay
a
*NL*
little
longer
?
I
am
ready
to
stay
if
you
wish
it
,
''
--
it
seemed
to
her
*NL*
as
if
going
or
staying
were
alike
dreary
.
Or
,
``
Should
you
like
to
go
*NL*
to
the
Farnesina
,
Dorothea
?
It
contains
celebrated
frescos
designed
or
*NL*
painted
by
Raphael
,
which
most
persons
think
it
worth
while
to
visit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
do
you
care
about
them
?
''
was
always
Dorothea
's
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
,
I
believe
,
highly
esteemed
.
Some
of
them
represent
the
*NL*
fable
of
Cupid
and
Psyche
,
which
is
probably
the
romantic
invention
of
*NL*
a
literary
period
,
and
can
not
,
I
think
,
be
reckoned
as
a
genuine
*NL*
mythical
product
.
But
if
you
like
these
wall-paintings
we
can
easily
*NL*
drive
thither
;
and
you
will
then
,
I
think
,
have
seen
the
chief
works
of
*NL*
Raphael
,
any
of
which
it
were
a
pity
to
omit
in
a
visit
to
Rome
.
He
is
*NL*
the
painter
who
has
been
held
to
combine
the
most
complete
grace
of
*NL*
form
with
sublimity
of
expression
.
Such
at
least
I
have
gathered
to
be
*NL*
the
opinion
of
cognoscenti
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
kind
of
answer
given
in
a
measured
official
tone
,
as
of
a
*NL*
clergyman
reading
according
to
the
rubric
,
did
not
help
to
justify
the
*NL*
glories
of
the
Eternal
City
,
or
to
give
her
the
hope
that
if
she
knew
*NL*
more
about
them
the
world
would
be
joyously
illuminated
for
her
.
There
*NL*
is
hardly
any
contact
more
depressing
to
a
young
ardent
creature
than
*NL*
that
of
a
mind
in
which
years
full
of
knowledge
seem
to
have
issued
in
*NL*
a
blank
absence
of
interest
or
sympathy
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
other
subjects
indeed
Mr.
Casaubon
showed
a
tenacity
of
occupation
*NL*
and
an
eagerness
which
are
usually
regarded
as
the
effect
of
*NL*
enthusiasm
,
and
Dorothea
was
anxious
to
follow
this
spontaneous
*NL*
direction
of
his
thoughts
,
instead
of
being
made
to
feel
that
she
*NL*
dragged
him
away
from
it
.
But
she
was
gradually
ceasing
to
expect
with
*NL*
her
former
delightful
confidence
that
she
should
see
any
wide
opening
*NL*
where
she
followed
him
.
Poor
Mr.
Casaubon
himself
was
lost
among
small
*NL*
closets
and
winding
stairs
,
and
in
an
agitated
dimness
about
the
*NL*
Cabeiri
,
or
in
an
exposure
of
other
mythologists
'
ill-considered
*NL*
parallels
,
easily
lost
sight
of
any
purpose
which
had
prompted
him
to
*NL*
these
labors
.
With
his
taper
stuck
before
him
he
forgot
the
absence
of
*NL*
windows
,
and
in
bitter
manuscript
remarks
on
other
men
's
notions
about
*NL*
the
solar
deities
,
he
had
become
indifferent
to
the
sunlight
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
characteristics
,
fixed
and
unchangeable
as
bone
in
Mr.
Casaubon
,
*NL*
might
have
remained
longer
unfelt
by
Dorothea
if
she
had
been
*NL*
encouraged
to
pour
forth
her
girlish
and
womanly
feeling
--
if
he
would
*NL*
have
held
her
hands
between
his
and
listened
with
the
delight
of
*NL*
tenderness
and
understanding
to
all
the
little
histories
which
made
up
*NL*
her
experience
,
and
would
have
given
her
the
same
sort
of
intimacy
in
*NL*
return
,
so
that
the
past
life
of
each
could
be
included
in
their
mutual
*NL*
knowledge
and
affection
--
or
if
she
could
have
fed
her
affection
with
*NL*
those
childlike
caresses
which
are
the
bent
of
every
sweet
woman
,
who
*NL*
has
begun
by
showering
kisses
on
the
hard
pate
of
her
bald
doll
,
*NL*
creating
a
happy
soul
within
that
woodenness
from
the
wealth
of
her
own
*NL*
love
.
That
was
Dorothea
's
bent
.
With
all
her
yearning
to
know
what
*NL*
was
afar
from
her
and
to
be
widely
benignant
,
she
had
ardor
enough
for
*NL*
what
was
near
,
to
have
kissed
Mr.
Casaubon
's
coat-sleeve
,
or
to
have
*NL*
caressed
his
shoe-latchet
,
if
he
would
have
made
any
other
sign
of
*NL*
acceptance
than
pronouncing
her
,
with
his
unfailing
propriety
,
to
be
of
*NL*
a
most
affectionate
and
truly
feminine
nature
,
indicating
at
the
same
*NL*
time
by
politely
reaching
a
chair
for
her
that
he
regarded
these
*NL*
manifestations
as
rather
crude
and
startling
.
Having
made
his
clerical
*NL*
toilet
with
due
care
in
the
morning
,
he
was
prepared
only
for
those
*NL*
amenities
of
life
which
were
suited
to
the
well-adjusted
stiff
cravat
*NL*
of
the
period
,
and
to
a
mind
weighted
with
unpublished
matter
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
by
a
sad
contradiction
Dorothea
's
ideas
and
resolves
seemed
like
*NL*
melting
ice
floating
and
lost
in
the
warm
flood
of
which
they
had
been
*NL*
but
another
form
.
She
was
humiliated
to
find
herself
a
mere
victim
of
*NL*
feeling
,
as
if
she
could
know
nothing
except
through
that
medium
:
all
*NL*
her
strength
was
scattered
in
fits
of
agitation
,
of
struggle
,
of
*NL*
despondency
,
and
then
again
in
visions
of
more
complete
renunciation
,
*NL*
transforming
all
hard
conditions
into
duty
.
Poor
Dorothea
!
she
was
*NL*
certainly
troublesome
--
to
herself
chiefly
;
but
this
morning
for
the
*NL*
first
time
she
had
been
troublesome
to
Mr.
Casaubon
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
begun
,
while
they
were
taking
coffee
,
with
a
determination
to
*NL*
shake
off
what
she
inwardly
called
her
selfishness
,
and
turned
a
face
*NL*
all
cheerful
attention
to
her
husband
when
he
said
,
``
My
dear
Dorothea
,
*NL*
we
must
now
think
of
all
that
is
yet
left
undone
,
as
a
preliminary
to
*NL*
our
departure
.
I
would
fain
have
returned
home
earlier
that
we
might
*NL*
have
been
at
Lowick
for
the
Christmas
;
but
my
inquiries
here
have
been
*NL*
protracted
beyond
their
anticipated
period
.
I
trust
,
however
,
that
the
*NL*
time
here
has
not
been
passed
unpleasantly
to
you
.
Among
the
sights
of
*NL*
Europe
,
that
of
Rome
has
ever
been
held
one
of
the
most
striking
and
in
*NL*
some
respects
edifying
.
I
well
remember
that
I
considered
it
an
epoch
*NL*
in
my
life
when
I
visited
it
for
the
first
time
;
after
the
fall
of
*NL*
Napoleon
,
an
event
which
opened
the
Continent
to
travellers
.
Indeed
I
*NL*
think
it
is
one
among
several
cities
to
which
an
extreme
hyperbole
has
*NL*
been
applied
--
`
See
Rome
and
die
:
'
but
in
your
case
I
would
propose
an
*NL*
emendation
and
say
,
See
Rome
as
a
bride
,
and
live
henceforth
as
a
happy
*NL*
wife
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Casaubon
pronounced
this
little
speech
with
the
most
conscientious
*NL*
intention
,
blinking
a
little
and
swaying
his
head
up
and
down
,
and
*NL*
concluding
with
a
smile
.
He
had
not
found
marriage
a
rapturous
state
,
*NL*
but
he
had
no
idea
of
being
anything
else
than
an
irreproachable
*NL*
husband
,
who
would
make
a
charming
young
woman
as
happy
as
she
deserved
*NL*
to
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
you
are
thoroughly
satisfied
with
our
stay
--
I
mean
,
with
the
*NL*
result
so
far
as
your
studies
are
concerned
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
trying
to
*NL*
keep
her
mind
fixed
on
what
most
affected
her
husband
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Mr.
Casaubon
,
with
that
peculiar
pitch
of
voice
which
makes
*NL*
the
word
half
a
negative
.
``
I
have
been
led
farther
than
I
had
*NL*
foreseen
,
and
various
subjects
for
annotation
have
presented
themselves
*NL*
which
,
though
I
have
no
direct
need
of
them
,
I
could
not
pretermit
.
*NL*
The
task
,
notwithstanding
the
assistance
of
my
amanuensis
,
has
been
a
*NL*
somewhat
laborious
one
,
but
your
society
has
happily
prevented
me
from
*NL*
that
too
continuous
prosecution
of
thought
beyond
the
hours
of
study
*NL*
which
has
been
the
snare
of
my
solitary
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
glad
that
my
presence
has
made
any
difference
to
you
,
''
said
*NL*
Dorothea
,
who
had
a
vivid
memory
of
evenings
in
which
she
had
supposed
*NL*
that
Mr.
Casaubon
's
mind
had
gone
too
deep
during
the
day
to
be
able
to
*NL*
get
to
the
surface
again
.
I
fear
there
was
a
little
temper
in
her
*NL*
reply
.
``
I
hope
when
we
get
to
Lowick
,
I
shall
be
more
useful
to
you
,
*NL*
and
be
able
to
enter
a
little
more
into
what
interests
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Doubtless
,
my
dear
,
''
said
Mr.
Casaubon
,
with
a
slight
bow
.
``
The
notes
*NL*
I
have
here
made
will
want
sifting
,
and
you
can
,
if
you
please
,
extract
*NL*
them
under
my
direction
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
all
your
notes
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
whose
heart
had
already
burned
*NL*
within
her
on
this
subject
,
so
that
now
she
could
not
help
speaking
*NL*
with
her
tongue
.
``
All
those
rows
of
volumes
--
will
you
not
now
do
what
*NL*
you
used
to
speak
of
?
--
will
you
not
make
up
your
mind
what
part
of
them
*NL*
you
will
use
,
and
begin
to
write
the
book
which
will
make
your
vast
*NL*
knowledge
useful
to
the
world
?
I
will
write
to
your
dictation
,
or
I
*NL*
will
copy
and
extract
what
you
tell
me
:
I
can
be
of
no
other
use
.
''
*NL*
Dorothea
,
in
a
most
unaccountable
,
darkly
feminine
manner
,
ended
with
a
*NL*
slight
sob
and
eyes
full
of
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
excessive
feeling
manifested
would
alone
have
been
highly
*NL*
disturbing
to
Mr.
Casaubon
,
but
there
were
other
reasons
why
Dorothea
's
*NL*
words
were
among
the
most
cutting
and
irritating
to
him
that
she
could
*NL*
have
been
impelled
to
use
.
She
was
as
blind
to
his
inward
troubles
as
*NL*
he
to
hers
:
she
had
not
yet
learned
those
hidden
conflicts
in
her
*NL*
husband
which
claim
our
pity
.
She
had
not
yet
listened
patiently
to
*NL*
his
heartbeats
,
but
only
felt
that
her
own
was
beating
violently
.
In
*NL*
Mr.
Casaubon
's
ear
,
Dorothea
's
voice
gave
loud
emphatic
iteration
to
*NL*
those
muffled
suggestions
of
consciousness
which
it
was
possible
to
*NL*
explain
as
mere
fancy
,
the
illusion
of
exaggerated
sensitiveness
:
*NL*
always
when
such
suggestions
are
unmistakably
repeated
from
without
,
*NL*
they
are
resisted
as
cruel
and
unjust
.
We
are
angered
even
by
the
full
*NL*
acceptance
of
our
humiliating
confessions
--
how
much
more
by
hearing
in
*NL*
hard
distinct
syllables
from
the
lips
of
a
near
observer
,
those
*NL*
confused
murmurs
which
we
try
to
call
morbid
,
and
strive
against
as
if
*NL*
they
were
the
oncoming
of
numbness
!
And
this
cruel
outward
accuser
was
*NL*
there
in
the
shape
of
a
wife
--
nay
,
of
a
young
bride
,
who
,
instead
of
*NL*
observing
his
abundant
pen-scratches
and
amplitude
of
paper
with
the
*NL*
uncritical
awe
of
an
elegant-minded
canary-bird
,
seemed
to
present
*NL*
herself
as
a
spy
watching
everything
with
a
malign
power
of
inference
.
*NL*
Here
,
towards
this
particular
point
of
the
compass
,
Mr.
Casaubon
had
a
*NL*
sensitiveness
to
match
Dorothea
's
,
and
an
equal
quickness
to
imagine
*NL*
more
than
the
fact
.
He
had
formerly
observed
with
approbation
her
*NL*
capacity
for
worshipping
the
right
object
;
he
now
foresaw
with
sudden
*NL*
terror
that
this
capacity
might
be
replaced
by
presumption
,
this
*NL*
worship
by
the
most
exasperating
of
all
criticism
,
--
that
which
sees
*NL*
vaguely
a
great
many
fine
ends
,
and
has
not
the
least
notion
what
it
*NL*
costs
to
reach
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
the
first
time
since
Dorothea
had
known
him
,
Mr.
Casaubon
's
face
*NL*
had
a
quick
angry
flush
upon
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
love
,
''
he
said
,
with
irritation
reined
in
by
propriety
,
``
you
may
*NL*
rely
upon
me
for
knowing
the
times
and
the
seasons
,
adapted
to
the
*NL*
different
stages
of
a
work
which
is
not
to
be
measured
by
the
facile
*NL*
conjectures
of
ignorant
onlookers
.
It
had
been
easy
for
me
to
gain
a
*NL*
temporary
effect
by
a
mirage
of
baseless
opinion
;
but
it
is
ever
the
*NL*
trial
of
the
scrupulous
explorer
to
be
saluted
with
the
impatient
scorn
*NL*
of
chatterers
who
attempt
only
the
smallest
achievements
,
being
indeed
*NL*
equipped
for
no
other
.
And
it
were
well
if
all
such
could
be
*NL*
admonished
to
discriminate
judgments
of
which
the
true
subject-matter
*NL*
lies
entirely
beyond
their
reach
,
from
those
of
which
the
elements
may
*NL*
be
compassed
by
a
narrow
and
superficial
survey
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
speech
was
delivered
with
an
energy
and
readiness
quite
unusual
*NL*
with
Mr.
Casaubon
.
It
was
not
indeed
entirely
an
improvisation
,
but
*NL*
had
taken
shape
in
inward
colloquy
,
and
rushed
out
like
the
round
*NL*
grains
from
a
fruit
when
sudden
heat
cracks
it
.
Dorothea
was
not
only
*NL*
his
wife
:
she
was
a
personification
of
that
shallow
world
which
*NL*
surrounds
the
appreciated
or
desponding
author
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
was
indignant
in
her
turn
.
Had
she
not
been
repressing
*NL*
everything
in
herself
except
the
desire
to
enter
into
some
fellowship
*NL*
with
her
husband
's
chief
interests
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
judgment
_
was
_
a
very
superficial
one
--
such
as
I
am
capable
of
*NL*
forming
,
''
she
answered
,
with
a
prompt
resentment
,
that
needed
no
*NL*
rehearsal
.
``
You
showed
me
the
rows
of
notebooks
--
you
have
often
spoken
*NL*
of
them
--
you
have
often
said
that
they
wanted
digesting
.
But
I
never
*NL*
heard
you
speak
of
the
writing
that
is
to
be
published
.
Those
were
*NL*
very
simple
facts
,
and
my
judgment
went
no
farther
.
I
only
begged
you
*NL*
to
let
me
be
of
some
good
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
rose
to
leave
the
table
and
Mr.
Casaubon
made
no
reply
,
taking
*NL*
up
a
letter
which
lay
beside
him
as
if
to
reperuse
it
.
Both
were
*NL*
shocked
at
their
mutual
situation
--
that
each
should
have
betrayed
anger
*NL*
towards
the
other
.
If
they
had
been
at
home
,
settled
at
Lowick
in
*NL*
ordinary
life
among
their
neighbors
,
the
clash
would
have
been
less
*NL*
embarrassing
:
but
on
a
wedding
journey
,
the
express
object
of
which
is
*NL*
to
isolate
two
people
on
the
ground
that
they
are
all
the
world
to
each
*NL*
other
,
the
sense
of
disagreement
is
,
to
say
the
least
,
confounding
and
*NL*
stultifying
.
To
have
changed
your
longitude
extensively
and
placed
*NL*
yourselves
in
a
moral
solitude
in
order
to
have
small
explosions
,
to
*NL*
find
conversation
difficult
and
to
hand
a
glass
of
water
without
*NL*
looking
,
can
hardly
be
regarded
as
satisfactory
fulfilment
even
to
the
*NL*
toughest
minds
.
To
Dorothea
's
inexperienced
sensitiveness
,
it
seemed
*NL*
like
a
catastrophe
,
changing
all
prospects
;
and
to
Mr.
Casaubon
it
was
*NL*
a
new
pain
,
he
never
having
been
on
a
wedding
journey
before
,
or
found
*NL*
himself
in
that
close
union
which
was
more
of
a
subjection
than
he
had
*NL*
been
able
to
imagine
,
since
this
charming
young
bride
not
only
obliged
*NL*
him
to
much
consideration
on
her
behalf
-LRB-
which
he
had
sedulously
*NL*
given
-RRB-
,
but
turned
out
to
be
capable
of
agitating
him
cruelly
just
*NL*
where
he
most
needed
soothing
.
Instead
of
getting
a
soft
fence
against
*NL*
the
cold
,
shadowy
,
unapplausive
audience
of
his
life
,
had
he
only
given
*NL*
it
a
more
substantial
presence
?
*NL*
*NL*
Neither
of
them
felt
it
possible
to
speak
again
at
present
.
To
have
*NL*
reversed
a
previous
arrangement
and
declined
to
go
out
would
have
been
*NL*
a
show
of
persistent
anger
which
Dorothea
's
conscience
shrank
from
,
*NL*
seeing
that
she
already
began
to
feel
herself
guilty
.
However
just
her
*NL*
indignation
might
be
,
her
ideal
was
not
to
claim
justice
,
but
to
give
*NL*
tenderness
.
So
when
the
carriage
came
to
the
door
,
she
drove
with
Mr.
*NL*
Casaubon
to
the
Vatican
,
walked
with
him
through
the
stony
avenue
of
*NL*
inscriptions
,
and
when
she
parted
with
him
at
the
entrance
to
the
*NL*
Library
,
went
on
through
the
Museum
out
of
mere
listlessness
as
to
what
*NL*
was
around
her
.
She
had
not
spirit
to
turn
round
and
say
that
she
*NL*
would
drive
anywhere
.
It
was
when
Mr.
Casaubon
was
quitting
her
that
*NL*
Naumann
had
first
seen
her
,
and
he
had
entered
the
long
gallery
of
*NL*
sculpture
at
the
same
time
with
her
;
but
here
Naumann
had
to
await
*NL*
Ladislaw
with
whom
he
was
to
settle
a
bet
of
champagne
about
an
*NL*
enigmatical
mediaeval-looking
figure
there
.
After
they
had
examined
*NL*
the
figure
,
and
had
walked
on
finishing
their
dispute
,
they
had
parted
,
*NL*
Ladislaw
lingering
behind
while
Naumann
had
gone
into
the
Hall
of
*NL*
Statues
where
he
again
saw
Dorothea
,
and
saw
her
in
that
brooding
*NL*
abstraction
which
made
her
pose
remarkable
.
She
did
not
really
see
the
*NL*
streak
of
sunlight
on
the
floor
more
than
she
saw
the
statues
:
she
was
*NL*
inwardly
seeing
the
light
of
years
to
come
in
her
own
home
and
over
the
*NL*
English
fields
and
elms
and
hedge-bordered
highroads
;
and
feeling
that
*NL*
the
way
in
which
they
might
be
filled
with
joyful
devotedness
was
not
*NL*
so
clear
to
her
as
it
had
been
.
But
in
Dorothea
's
mind
there
was
a
*NL*
current
into
which
all
thought
and
feeling
were
apt
sooner
or
later
to
*NL*
flow
--
the
reaching
forward
of
the
whole
consciousness
towards
the
*NL*
fullest
truth
,
the
least
partial
good
.
There
was
clearly
something
*NL*
better
than
anger
and
despondency
.

--
CHAUCER
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
in
that
way
Dorothea
came
to
be
sobbing
as
soon
as
she
was
*NL*
securely
alone
.
But
she
was
presently
roused
by
a
knock
at
the
door
,
*NL*
which
made
her
hastily
dry
her
eyes
before
saying
,
``
Come
in
.
''
Tantripp
*NL*
had
brought
a
card
,
and
said
that
there
was
a
gentleman
waiting
in
the
*NL*
lobby
.
The
courier
had
told
him
that
only
Mrs.
Casaubon
was
at
home
,
*NL*
but
he
said
he
was
a
relation
of
Mr.
Casaubon
's
:
would
she
see
him
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
without
pause
;
``
show
him
into
the
salon
.
''
Her
*NL*
chief
impressions
about
young
Ladislaw
were
that
when
she
had
seen
him
*NL*
at
Lowick
she
had
been
made
aware
of
Mr.
Casaubon
's
generosity
towards
*NL*
him
,
and
also
that
she
had
been
interested
in
his
own
hesitation
about
*NL*
his
career
.
She
was
alive
to
anything
that
gave
her
an
opportunity
for
*NL*
active
sympathy
,
and
at
this
moment
it
seemed
as
if
the
visit
had
come
*NL*
to
shake
her
out
of
her
self-absorbed
discontent
--
to
remind
her
of
her
*NL*
husband
's
goodness
,
and
make
her
feel
that
she
had
now
the
right
to
be
*NL*
his
helpmate
in
all
kind
deeds
.
She
waited
a
minute
or
two
,
but
when
*NL*
she
passed
into
the
next
room
there
were
just
signs
enough
that
she
had
*NL*
been
crying
to
make
her
open
face
look
more
youthful
and
appealing
than
*NL*
usual
.
She
met
Ladislaw
with
that
exquisite
smile
of
good-will
which
*NL*
is
unmixed
with
vanity
,
and
held
out
her
hand
to
him
.
He
was
the
elder
*NL*
by
several
years
,
but
at
that
moment
he
looked
much
the
younger
,
for
*NL*
his
transparent
complexion
flushed
suddenly
,
and
he
spoke
with
a
*NL*
shyness
extremely
unlike
the
ready
indifference
of
his
manner
with
his
*NL*
male
companion
,
while
Dorothea
became
all
the
calmer
with
a
wondering
*NL*
desire
to
put
him
at
ease
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
not
aware
that
you
and
Mr.
Casaubon
were
in
Rome
,
until
this
*NL*
morning
,
when
I
saw
you
in
the
Vatican
Museum
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
knew
you
*NL*
at
once
--
but
--
I
mean
,
that
I
concluded
Mr.
Casaubon
's
address
would
be
*NL*
found
at
the
Poste
Restante
,
and
I
was
anxious
to
pay
my
respects
to

him

you
as
early
as
possible

*NL*
*NL*
``
Pray
sit
down

not
here
now
,
but
he
will
be
glad
to
hear
of

you

I
am
sure

''
said
Dorothea
,
seating
herself
unthinkingly
between
*NL*
the
fire
and
the
light
of
the
tall
window
,
and
pointing
to
a
chair
*NL*
opposite
,
with
the
quietude
of
a
benignant
matron
.
The
signs
of
*NL*
girlish
sorrow
in
her
face
were
only
the
more
striking
.
``
Mr.
Casaubon
*NL*
is
much
engaged
;
but
you
will
leave
your
address
--
will
you
not
?
--
and
*NL*
he
will
write
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
very
good
,
''
said
Ladislaw
,
beginning
to
lose
his
diffidence
in
*NL*
the
interest
with
which
he
was
observing
the
signs
of
weeping
which
had
*NL*
altered
her
face
.
``
My
address
is
on
my
card
.
But
if
you
will
allow
me
*NL*
I
will
call
again
to-morrow
at
an
hour
when
Mr.
Casaubon
is
likely
to
*NL*
be
at
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
goes
to
read
in
the
Library
of
the
Vatican
every
day
,

you
can
*NL*
hardly
see
him
except
by
an
appointment
.
Especially
now
.
We
are
about
*NL*
to
leave
Rome
,
and
he
is
very
busy
.
He
is
usually
away
almost
from
*NL*
breakfast
till
dinner
.
But
I
am
sure
he
will
wish
you
to
dine
with
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Will
Ladislaw
was
struck
mute
for
a
few
moments
.
He
had
never
been
*NL*
fond
of
Mr.
Casaubon
,
and
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
sense
of
*NL*
obligation
,
would
have
laughed
at
him
as
a
Bat
of
erudition
.
But
the
*NL*
idea
of
this
dried-up
pedant
,
this
elaborator
of
small
explanations
*NL*
about
as
important
as
the
surplus
stock
of
false
antiquities
kept
in
a
*NL*
vendor
's
back
chamber
,
having
first
got
this
adorable
young
creature
to
*NL*
marry
him
,
and
then
passing
his
honeymoon
away
from
her
,
groping
after
*NL*
his
mouldy
futilities
-LRB-
Will
was
given
to
hyperbole
-RRB-
--
this
sudden
*NL*
picture
stirred
him
with
a
sort
of
comic
disgust
:
he
was
divided
*NL*
between
the
impulse
to
laugh
aloud
and
the
equally
unseasonable
impulse
*NL*
to
burst
into
scornful
invective
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
an
instant
he
felt
that
the
struggle
,
was
causing
a
queer
*NL*
contortion
of
his
mobile
features
,
but
with
a
good
effort
he
resolved
*NL*
it
into
nothing
more
offensive
than
a
merry
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
wondered
;
but
the
smile
was
irresistible
,
and
shone
back
from
*NL*
her
face
too
.
Will
Ladislaw
's
smile
was
delightful
,
unless
you
were
*NL*
angry
with
him
beforehand
:
it
was
a
gush
of
inward
light
illuminating
*NL*
the
transparent
skin
as
well
as
the
eyes
,
and
playing
about
every
curve
*NL*
and
line
as
if
some
Ariel
were
touching
them
with
a
new
charm
,
and
*NL*
banishing
forever
the
traces
of
moodiness
.
The
reflection
of
that
*NL*
smile
could
not
but
have
a
little
merriment
in
it
too
,
even
under
dark
*NL*
eyelashes
still
moist
,
as
Dorothea
said
inquiringly
,
``
Something
amuses
*NL*
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Will
,
quick
in
finding
resources
.
``
I
am
thinking
of
the
*NL*
sort
of
figure
I
cut
the
first
time
I
saw
you
,
when
you
annihilated
my
*NL*
poor
sketch
with
your
criticism
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
criticism
?
''
said
Dorothea
,
wondering
still
more
.
``
Surely
not
.
I
*NL*
always
feel
particularly
ignorant
about
painting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suspected
you
of
knowing
so
much
,
that
you
knew
how
to
say
just
what
*NL*
was
most
cutting
.
You
said
--
I
dare
say
you
do
n't
remember
it
as
I
*NL*
do
--
that
the
relation
of
my
sketch
to
nature
was
quite
hidden
from
you
.
*NL*
At
least
,
you
implied
that
.
''
Will
could
laugh
now
as
well
as
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
was
really
my
ignorance
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
admiring
*NL*
Will
's
good-humor
.
``
I
must
have
said
so
only
because
I
never
could
see
*NL*
any
beauty
in
the
pictures
which
my
uncle
told
me
all
judges
thought
*NL*
very
fine
.
And
I
have
gone
about
with
just
the
same
ignorance
in
Rome
.
*NL*
There
are
comparatively
few
paintings
that
I
can
really
enjoy
.
At
*NL*
first
when
I
enter
a
room
where
the
walls
are
covered
with
frescos
,
or
*NL*
with
rare
pictures
,
I
feel
a
kind
of
awe
--
like
a
child
present
at
great
*NL*
ceremonies
where
there
are
grand
robes
and
processions
;
I
feel
myself
*NL*
in
the
presence
of
some
higher
life
than
my
own
.
But
when
I
begin
to
*NL*
examine
the
pictures
one
by
one
the
life
goes
out
of
them
,
or
else
is
*NL*
something
violent
and
strange
to
me
.
It
must
be
my
own
dulness
.
I
am
*NL*
seeing
so
much
all
at
once
,
and
not
understanding
half
of
it
.
That
*NL*
always
makes
one
feel
stupid
.
It
is
painful
to
be
told
that
anything
*NL*
is
very
fine
and
not
be
able
to
feel
that
it
is
fine
--
something
like
*NL*
being
blind
,
while
people
talk
of
the
sky
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
there
is
a
great
deal
in
the
feeling
for
art
which
must
be
*NL*
acquired
,
''
said
Will
.
-LRB-
It
was
impossible
now
to
doubt
the
directness
*NL*
of
Dorothea
's
confession
.
-RRB-
``
Art
is
an
old
language
with
a
great
many
*NL*
artificial
affected
styles
,
and
sometimes
the
chief
pleasure
one
gets
*NL*
out
of
knowing
them
is
the
mere
sense
of
knowing
.
I
enjoy
the
art
of
*NL*
all
sorts
here
immensely
;
but
I
suppose
if
I
could
pick
my
enjoyment
to
*NL*
pieces
I
should
find
it
made
up
of
many
different
threads
.
There
is
*NL*
something
in
daubing
a
little
one
's
self
,
and
having
an
idea
of
the
*NL*
process
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
mean
perhaps
to
be
a
painter
?
''
said
Dorothea
,
with
a
new
direction
*NL*
of
interest
.
``
You
mean
to
make
painting
your
profession
?
Mr.
Casaubon
*NL*
will
like
to
hear
that
you
have
chosen
a
profession
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
oh
no
,
''
said
Will
,
with
some
coldness
.
``
I
have
quite
made
up
my
*NL*
mind
against
it
.
It
is
too
one-sided
a
life
.
I
have
been
seeing
a
*NL*
great
deal
of
the
German
artists
here
:
I
travelled
from
Frankfort
with
*NL*
one
of
them
.
Some
are
fine
,
even
brilliant
fellows
--
but
I
should
not
*NL*
like
to
get
into
their
way
of
looking
at
the
world
entirely
from
the
*NL*
studio
point
of
view
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
I
can
understand
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
cordially
.
``
And
in
Rome
it
*NL*
seems
as
if
there
were
so
many
things
which
are
more
wanted
in
the
*NL*
world
than
pictures
.
But
if
you
have
a
genius
for
painting
,
would
it
*NL*
not
be
right
to
take
that
as
a
guide
?
Perhaps
you
might
do
better
*NL*
things
than
these
--
or
different
,
so
that
there
might
not
be
so
many
*NL*
pictures
almost
all
alike
in
the
same
place
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
mistaking
this
simplicity
,
and
Will
was
won
by
it
into
*NL*
frankness
.
``
A
man
must
have
a
very
rare
genius
to
make
changes
of
that
*NL*
sort
.
I
am
afraid
mine
would
not
carry
me
even
to
the
pitch
of
doing
*NL*
well
what
has
been
done
already
,
at
least
not
so
well
as
to
make
it
*NL*
worth
while
.
And
I
should
never
succeed
in
anything
by
dint
of
*NL*
drudgery
.
If
things
do
n't
come
easily
to
me
I
never
get
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
heard
Mr.
Casaubon
say
that
he
regrets
your
want
of
patience
,
''
*NL*
said
Dorothea
,
gently
.
She
was
rather
shocked
at
this
mode
of
taking
*NL*
all
life
as
a
holiday
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
know
Mr.
Casaubon
's
opinion
.
He
and
I
differ
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
slight
streak
of
contempt
in
this
hasty
reply
offended
Dorothea
.
*NL*
She
was
all
the
more
susceptible
about
Mr.
Casaubon
because
of
her
*NL*
morning
's
trouble
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
you
differ
,
''
she
said
,
rather
proudly
.
``
I
did
not
think
of
*NL*
comparing
you
:
such
power
of
persevering
devoted
labor
as
Mr.
*NL*
Casaubon
's
is
not
common
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Will
saw
that
she
was
offended
,
but
this
only
gave
an
additional
*NL*
impulse
to
the
new
irritation
of
his
latent
dislike
towards
Mr.
*NL*
Casaubon
.
It
was
too
intolerable
that
Dorothea
should
be
worshipping
*NL*
this
husband
:
such
weakness
in
a
woman
is
pleasant
to
no
man
but
the
*NL*
husband
in
question
.
Mortals
are
easily
tempted
to
pinch
the
life
out
*NL*
of
their
neighbor
's
buzzing
glory
,
and
think
that
such
killing
is
no
*NL*
murder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
indeed
,
''
he
answered
,
promptly
.
``
And
therefore
it
is
a
pity
that
*NL*
it
should
be
thrown
away
,
as
so
much
English
scholarship
is
,
for
want
*NL*
of
knowing
what
is
being
done
by
the
rest
of
the
world
.
If
Mr.
*NL*
Casaubon
read
German
he
would
save
himself
a
great
deal
of
trouble
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
understand
you
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
startled
and
anxious
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
merely
mean
,
''
said
Will
,
in
an
offhand
way
,
``
that
the
Germans
have
*NL*
taken
the
lead
in
historical
inquiries
,
and
they
laugh
at
results
which
*NL*
are
got
by
groping
about
in
woods
with
a
pocket-compass
while
they
have
*NL*
made
good
roads
.
When
I
was
with
Mr.
Casaubon
I
saw
that
he
deafened
*NL*
himself
in
that
direction
:
it
was
almost
against
his
will
that
he
read
*NL*
a
Latin
treatise
written
by
a
German
.
I
was
very
sorry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Will
only
thought
of
giving
a
good
pinch
that
would
annihilate
that
*NL*
vaunted
laboriousness
,
and
was
unable
to
imagine
the
mode
in
which
*NL*
Dorothea
would
be
wounded
.
Young
Mr.
Ladislaw
was
not
at
all
deep
*NL*
himself
in
German
writers
;
but
very
little
achievement
is
required
in
*NL*
order
to
pity
another
man
's
shortcomings
.
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Dorothea
felt
a
pang
at
the
thought
that
the
labor
of
her
*NL*
husband
's
life
might
be
void
,
which
left
her
no
energy
to
spare
for
the
*NL*
question
whether
this
young
relative
who
was
so
much
obliged
to
him
*NL*
ought
not
to
have
repressed
his
observation
.
She
did
not
even
speak
,
*NL*
but
sat
looking
at
her
hands
,
absorbed
in
the
piteousness
of
that
*NL*
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
Will
,
however
,
having
given
that
annihilating
pinch
,
was
rather
*NL*
ashamed
,
imagining
from
Dorothea
's
silence
that
he
had
offended
her
*NL*
still
more
;
and
having
also
a
conscience
about
plucking
the
*NL*
tail-feathers
from
a
benefactor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
regretted
it
especially
,
''
he
resumed
,
taking
the
usual
course
from
*NL*
detraction
to
insincere
eulogy
,
``
because
of
my
gratitude
and
respect
*NL*
towards
my
cousin
.
It
would
not
signify
so
much
in
a
man
whose
talents
*NL*
and
character
were
less
distinguished
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
raised
her
eyes
,
brighter
than
usual
with
excited
feeling
,
and
*NL*
said
in
her
saddest
recitative
,
``
How
I
wish
I
had
learned
German
when
I
*NL*
was
at
Lausanne
!
There
were
plenty
of
German
teachers
.
But
now
I
can
*NL*
be
of
no
use
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
new
light
,
but
still
a
mysterious
light
,
for
Will
in
*NL*
Dorothea
's
last
words
.
The
question
how
she
had
come
to
accept
Mr.
*NL*
Casaubon
--
which
he
had
dismissed
when
he
first
saw
her
by
saying
that
*NL*
she
must
be
disagreeable
in
spite
of
appearances
--
was
not
now
to
be
*NL*
answered
on
any
such
short
and
easy
method
.
Whatever
else
she
might
*NL*
be
,
she
was
not
disagreeable
.
She
was
not
coldly
clever
and
indirectly
*NL*
satirical
,
but
adorably
simple
and
full
of
feeling
.
She
was
an
angel
*NL*
beguiled
.
It
would
be
a
unique
delight
to
wait
and
watch
for
the
*NL*
melodious
fragments
in
which
her
heart
and
soul
came
forth
so
directly
*NL*
and
ingenuously
.
The
Aeolian
harp
again
came
into
his
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
must
have
made
some
original
romance
for
herself
in
this
marriage
.
*NL*
And
if
Mr.
Casaubon
had
been
a
dragon
who
had
carried
her
off
to
his
*NL*
lair
with
his
talons
simply
and
without
legal
forms
,
it
would
have
been
*NL*
an
unavoidable
feat
of
heroism
to
release
her
and
fall
at
her
feet
.
*NL*
But
he
was
something
more
unmanageable
than
a
dragon
:
he
was
a
*NL*
benefactor
with
collective
society
at
his
back
,
and
he
was
at
that
*NL*
moment
entering
the
room
in
all
the
unimpeachable
correctness
of
his
*NL*
demeanor
,
while
Dorothea
was
looking
animated
with
a
newly
roused
alarm
*NL*
and
regret
,
and
Will
was
looking
animated
with
his
admiring
speculation
*NL*
about
her
feelings
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Casaubon
felt
a
surprise
which
was
quite
unmixed
with
pleasure
,
but
*NL*
he
did
not
swerve
from
his
usual
politeness
of
greeting
,
when
Will
rose
*NL*
and
explained
his
presence
.
Mr.
Casaubon
was
less
happy
than
usual
,
*NL*
and
this
perhaps
made
him
look
all
the
dimmer
and
more
faded
;
else
,
the
*NL*
effect
might
easily
have
been
produced
by
the
contrast
of
his
young
*NL*
cousin
's
appearance
.
The
first
impression
on
seeing
Will
was
one
of
*NL*
sunny
brightness
,
which
added
to
the
uncertainty
of
his
changing
*NL*
expression
.
Surely
,
his
very
features
changed
their
form
,
his
jaw
*NL*
looked
sometimes
large
and
sometimes
small
;
and
the
little
ripple
in
*NL*
his
nose
was
a
preparation
for
metamorphosis
.
When
he
turned
his
head
*NL*
quickly
his
hair
seemed
to
shake
out
light
,
and
some
persons
thought
*NL*
they
saw
decided
genius
in
this
coruscation
.
Mr.
Casaubon
,
on
the
*NL*
contrary
,
stood
rayless
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
Dorothea
's
eyes
were
turned
anxiously
on
her
husband
she
was
perhaps
*NL*
not
insensible
to
the
contrast
,
but
it
was
only
mingled
with
other
*NL*
causes
in
making
her
more
conscious
of
that
new
alarm
on
his
behalf
*NL*
which
was
the
first
stirring
of
a
pitying
tenderness
fed
by
the
*NL*
realities
of
his
lot
and
not
by
her
own
dreams
.
Yet
it
was
a
source
of
*NL*
greater
freedom
to
her
that
Will
was
there
;
his
young
equality
was
*NL*
agreeable
,
and
also
perhaps
his
openness
to
conviction
.
She
felt
an
*NL*
immense
need
of
some
one
to
speak
to
,
and
she
had
never
before
seen
any
*NL*
one
who
seemed
so
quick
and
pliable
,
so
likely
to
understand
everything
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Casaubon
gravely
hoped
that
Will
was
passing
his
time
profitably
as
*NL*
well
as
pleasantly
in
Rome
--
had
thought
his
intention
was
to
remain
in
*NL*
South
Germany
--
but
begged
him
to
come
and
dine
to-morrow
,
when
he
could
*NL*
converse
more
at
large
:
at
present
he
was
somewhat
weary
.
Ladislaw
*NL*
understood
,
and
accepting
the
invitation
immediately
took
his
leave
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
's
eyes
followed
her
husband
anxiously
,
while
he
sank
down
*NL*
wearily
at
the
end
of
a
sofa
,
and
resting
his
elbow
supported
his
head
*NL*
and
looked
on
the
floor
.
A
little
flushed
,
and
with
bright
eyes
,
she
*NL*
seated
herself
beside
him
,
and
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Forgive
me
for
speaking
so
hastily
to
you
this
morning
.
I
was
wrong
.
*NL*
I
fear
I
hurt
you
and
made
the
day
more
burdensome
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
glad
that
you
feel
that
,
my
dear
,
''
said
Mr.
Casaubon
.
He
spoke
*NL*
quietly
and
bowed
his
head
a
little
,
but
there
was
still
an
uneasy
*NL*
feeling
in
his
eyes
as
he
looked
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
do
forgive
me
?
''
said
Dorothea
,
with
a
quick
sob
.
In
her
need
*NL*
for
some
manifestation
of
feeling
she
was
ready
to
exaggerate
her
own
*NL*
fault
.
Would
not
love
see
returning
penitence
afar
off
,
and
fall
on
*NL*
its
neck
and
kiss
it
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Dorothea
--
`
who
with
repentance
is
not
satisfied
,
is
not
of
*NL*
heaven
nor
earth
:
'
--
you
do
not
think
me
worthy
to
be
banished
by
that
*NL*
severe
sentence
,
''
said
Mr.
Casaubon
,
exerting
himself
to
make
a
strong
*NL*
statement
,
and
also
to
smile
faintly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
was
silent
,
but
a
tear
which
had
come
up
with
the
sob
would
*NL*
insist
on
falling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
excited
,
my
dear
.
And
I
also
am
feeling
some
unpleasant
*NL*
consequences
of
too
much
mental
disturbance
,
''
said
Mr.
Casaubon
.
In
*NL*
fact
,
he
had
it
in
his
thought
to
tell
her
that
she
ought
not
to
have
*NL*
received
young
Ladislaw
in
his
absence
:
but
he
abstained
,
partly
from
*NL*
the
sense
that
it
would
be
ungracious
to
bring
a
new
complaint
in
the
*NL*
moment
of
her
penitent
acknowledgment
,
partly
because
he
wanted
to
*NL*
avoid
further
agitation
of
himself
by
speech
,
and
partly
because
he
was
*NL*
too
proud
to
betray
that
jealousy
of
disposition
which
was
not
so
*NL*
exhausted
on
his
scholarly
compeers
that
there
was
none
to
spare
in
*NL*
other
directions
.
There
is
a
sort
of
jealousy
which
needs
very
little
*NL*
fire
:
it
is
hardly
a
passion
,
but
a
blight
bred
in
the
cloudy
,
damp
*NL*
despondency
of
uneasy
egoism
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
it
is
time
for
us
to
dress
,
''
he
added
,
looking
at
his
watch
.
*NL*
They
both
rose
,
and
there
was
never
any
further
allusion
between
them
*NL*
to
what
had
passed
on
this
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Dorothea
remembered
it
to
the
last
with
the
vividness
with
which
we
*NL*
all
remember
epochs
in
our
experience
when
some
dear
expectation
dies
,
*NL*
or
some
new
motive
is
born
.
Today
she
had
begun
to
see
that
she
had
*NL*
been
under
a
wild
illusion
in
expecting
a
response
to
her
feeling
from
*NL*
Mr.
Casaubon
,
and
she
had
felt
the
waking
of
a
presentiment
that
there
*NL*
might
be
a
sad
consciousness
in
his
life
which
made
as
great
a
need
on
*NL*
his
side
as
on
her
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
are
all
of
us
born
in
moral
stupidity
,
taking
the
world
as
an
udder
*NL*
to
feed
our
supreme
selves
:
Dorothea
had
early
begun
to
emerge
from
*NL*
that
stupidity
,
but
yet
it
had
been
easier
to
her
to
imagine
how
she
*NL*
would
devote
herself
to
Mr.
Casaubon
,
and
become
wise
and
strong
in
his
*NL*
strength
and
wisdom
,
than
to
conceive
with
that
distinctness
which
is
*NL*
no
longer
reflection
but
feeling
--
an
idea
wrought
back
to
the
*NL*
directness
of
sense
,
like
the
solidity
of
objects
--
that
he
had
an
*NL*
equivalent
centre
of
self
,
whence
the
lights
and
shadows
must
always
*NL*
fall
with
a
certain
difference
.

ALFRED
DE
MUSSET
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Will
Ladislaw
was
delightfully
agreeable
at
dinner
the
next
day
,
and
*NL*
gave
no
opportunity
for
Mr.
Casaubon
to
show
disapprobation
.
On
the
*NL*
contrary
it
seemed
to
Dorothea
that
Will
had
a
happier
way
of
drawing
*NL*
her
husband
into
conversation
and
of
deferentially
listening
to
him
*NL*
than
she
had
ever
observed
in
any
one
before
.
To
be
sure
,
the
*NL*
listeners
about
Tipton
were
not
highly
gifted
!
Will
talked
a
good
deal
*NL*
himself
,
but
what
he
said
was
thrown
in
with
such
rapidity
,
and
with
*NL*
such
an
unimportant
air
of
saying
something
by
the
way
,
that
it
seemed
*NL*
a
gay
little
chime
after
the
great
bell
.
If
Will
was
not
always
*NL*
perfect
,
this
was
certainly
one
of
his
good
days
.
He
described
touches
*NL*
of
incident
among
the
poor
people
in
Rome
,
only
to
be
seen
by
one
who
*NL*
could
move
about
freely
;
he
found
himself
in
agreement
with
Mr.
*NL*
Casaubon
as
to
the
unsound
opinions
of
Middleton
concerning
the
*NL*
relations
of
Judaism
and
Catholicism
;
and
passed
easily
to
a
*NL*
half-enthusiastic
half-playful
picture
of
the
enjoyment
he
got
out
of
*NL*
the
very
miscellaneousness
of
Rome
,
which
made
the
mind
flexible
with
*NL*
constant
comparison
,
and
saved
you
from
seeing
the
world
's
ages
as
a
*NL*
set
of
box-like
partitions
without
vital
connection
.
Mr.
Casaubon
's
*NL*
studies
,
Will
observed
,
had
always
been
of
too
broad
a
kind
for
that
,
*NL*
and
he
had
perhaps
never
felt
any
such
sudden
effect
,
but
for
himself
*NL*
he
confessed
that
Rome
had
given
him
quite
a
new
sense
of
history
as
a
*NL*
whole
:
the
fragments
stimulated
his
imagination
and
made
him
*NL*
constructive
.
Then
occasionally
,
but
not
too
often
,
he
appealed
to
*NL*
Dorothea
,
and
discussed
what
she
said
,
as
if
her
sentiment
were
an
item
*NL*
to
be
considered
in
the
final
judgment
even
of
the
Madonna
di
Foligno
*NL*
or
the
Laocoon
.
A
sense
of
contributing
to
form
the
world
's
opinion
*NL*
makes
conversation
particularly
cheerful
;
and
Mr.
Casaubon
too
was
not
*NL*
without
his
pride
in
his
young
wife
,
who
spoke
better
than
most
women
,
*NL*
as
indeed
he
had
perceived
in
choosing
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Since
things
were
going
on
so
pleasantly
,
Mr.
Casaubon
's
statement
that
*NL*
his
labors
in
the
Library
would
be
suspended
for
a
couple
of
days
,
and
*NL*
that
after
a
brief
renewal
he
should
have
no
further
reason
for
staying
*NL*
in
Rome
,
encouraged
Will
to
urge
that
Mrs.
Casaubon
should
not
go
away
*NL*
without
seeing
a
studio
or
two
.
Would
not
Mr.
Casaubon
take
her
?
That
*NL*
sort
of
thing
ought
not
to
be
missed
:
it
was
quite
special
:
it
was
a
*NL*
form
of
life
that
grew
like
a
small
fresh
vegetation
with
its
*NL*
population
of
insects
on
huge
fossils
.
Will
would
be
happy
to
conduct
*NL*
them
--
not
to
anything
wearisome
,
only
to
a
few
examples
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Casaubon
,
seeing
Dorothea
look
earnestly
towards
him
,
could
not
but
*NL*
ask
her
if
she
would
be
interested
in
such
visits
:
he
was
now
at
her
*NL*
service
during
the
whole
day
;
and
it
was
agreed
that
Will
should
come
*NL*
on
the
morrow
and
drive
with
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Will
could
not
omit
Thorwaldsen
,
a
living
celebrity
about
whom
even
Mr.
*NL*
Casaubon
inquired
,
but
before
the
day
was
far
advanced
he
led
the
way
*NL*
to
the
studio
of
his
friend
Adolf
Naumann
,
whom
he
mentioned
as
one
of
*NL*
the
chief
renovators
of
Christian
art
,
one
of
those
who
had
not
only
*NL*
revived
but
expanded
that
grand
conception
of
supreme
events
as
*NL*
mysteries
at
which
the
successive
ages
were
spectators
,
and
in
relation
*NL*
to
which
the
great
souls
of
all
periods
became
as
it
were
*NL*
contemporaries
.
Will
added
that
he
had
made
himself
Naumann
's
pupil
*NL*
for
the
nonce
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
been
making
some
oil-sketches
under
him
,
''
said
Will
.
``
I
hate
*NL*
copying
.
I
must
put
something
of
my
own
in
.
Naumann
has
been
painting
*NL*
the
Saints
drawing
the
Car
of
the
Church
,
and
I
have
been
making
a
*NL*
sketch
of
Marlowe
's
Tamburlaine
Driving
the
Conquered
Kings
in
his
*NL*
Chariot
.
I
am
not
so
ecclesiastical
as
Naumann
,
and
I
sometimes
twit
*NL*
him
with
his
excess
of
meaning
.
But
this
time
I
mean
to
outdo
him
in
*NL*
breadth
of
intention
.
I
take
Tamburlaine
in
his
chariot
for
the
*NL*
tremendous
course
of
the
world
's
physical
history
lashing
on
the
*NL*
harnessed
dynasties
.
In
my
opinion
,
that
is
a
good
mythical
*NL*
interpretation
.
''
Will
here
looked
at
Mr.
Casaubon
,
who
received
this
*NL*
offhand
treatment
of
symbolism
very
uneasily
,
and
bowed
with
a
neutral
*NL*
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
sketch
must
be
very
grand
,
if
it
conveys
so
much
,
''
said
Dorothea
.
*NL*
``
I
should
need
some
explanation
even
of
the
meaning
you
give
.
Do
you
*NL*
intend
Tamburlaine
to
represent
earthquakes
and
volcanoes
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
,
''
said
Will
,
laughing
,
``
and
migrations
of
races
and
clearings
*NL*
of
forests
--
and
America
and
the
steam-engine
.
Everything
you
can
*NL*
imagine
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
difficult
kind
of
shorthand
!
''
said
Dorothea
,
smiling
towards
*NL*
her
husband
.
``
It
would
require
all
your
knowledge
to
be
able
to
read
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Casaubon
blinked
furtively
at
Will
.
He
had
a
suspicion
that
he
was
*NL*
being
laughed
at
.
But
it
was
not
possible
to
include
Dorothea
in
the
*NL*
suspicion
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
found
Naumann
painting
industriously
,
but
no
model
was
present
;
*NL*
his
pictures
were
advantageously
arranged
,
and
his
own
plain
vivacious
*NL*
person
set
off
by
a
dove-colored
blouse
and
a
maroon
velvet
cap
,
so
*NL*
that
everything
was
as
fortunate
as
if
he
had
expected
the
beautiful
*NL*
young
English
lady
exactly
at
that
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
painter
in
his
confident
English
gave
little
dissertations
on
his
*NL*
finished
and
unfinished
subjects
,
seeming
to
observe
Mr.
Casaubon
as
*NL*
much
as
he
did
Dorothea
.
Will
burst
in
here
and
there
with
ardent
*NL*
words
of
praise
,
marking
out
particular
merits
in
his
friend
's
work
;
*NL*
and
Dorothea
felt
that
she
was
getting
quite
new
notions
as
to
the
*NL*
significance
of
Madonnas
seated
under
inexplicable
canopied
thrones
*NL*
with
the
simple
country
as
a
background
,
and
of
saints
with
*NL*
architectural
models
in
their
hands
,
or
knives
accidentally
wedged
in
*NL*
their
skulls
.
Some
things
which
had
seemed
monstrous
to
her
were
*NL*
gathering
intelligibility
and
even
a
natural
meaning
:
but
all
this
was
*NL*
apparently
a
branch
of
knowledge
in
which
Mr.
Casaubon
had
not
*NL*
interested
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
would
rather
feel
that
painting
is
beautiful
than
have
to
*NL*
read
it
as
an
enigma
;
but
I
should
learn
to
understand
these
pictures
*NL*
sooner
than
yours
with
the
very
wide
meaning
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
speaking
*NL*
to
Will
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
speak
of
my
painting
before
Naumann
,
''
said
Will
.
``
He
will
tell
*NL*
you
,
it
is
all
pfuscherei
,
which
is
his
most
opprobrious
word
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
true
?
''
said
Dorothea
,
turning
her
sincere
eyes
on
Naumann
,
who
*NL*
made
a
slight
grimace
and
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
he
does
not
mean
it
seriously
with
painting
.
His
walk
must
be
*NL*
belles-lettres
.
That
is
wi-ide
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Naumann
's
pronunciation
of
the
vowel
seemed
to
stretch
the
word
*NL*
satirically
.
Will
did
not
half
like
it
,
but
managed
to
laugh
:
and
Mr.
*NL*
Casaubon
,
while
he
felt
some
disgust
at
the
artist
's
German
accent
,
*NL*
began
to
entertain
a
little
respect
for
his
judicious
severity
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
respect
was
not
diminished
when
Naumann
,
after
drawing
Will
aside
*NL*
for
a
moment
and
looking
,
first
at
a
large
canvas
,
then
at
Mr.
*NL*
Casaubon
,
came
forward
again
and
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
friend
Ladislaw
thinks
you
will
pardon
me
,
sir
,
if
I
say
that
a
*NL*
sketch
of
your
head
would
be
invaluable
to
me
for
the
St.
Thomas
*NL*
Aquinas
in
my
picture
there
.
It
is
too
much
to
ask
;
but
I
so
seldom
*NL*
see
just
what
I
want
--
the
idealistic
in
the
real
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
astonish
me
greatly
,
sir
,
''
said
Mr.
Casaubon
,
his
looks
improved
*NL*
with
a
glow
of
delight
;
``
but
if
my
poor
physiognomy
,
which
I
have
been
*NL*
accustomed
to
regard
as
of
the
commonest
order
,
can
be
of
any
use
to
*NL*
you
in
furnishing
some
traits
for
the
angelical
doctor
,
I
shall
feel
*NL*
honored
.
That
is
to
say
,
if
the
operation
will
not
be
a
lengthy
one
;
*NL*
and
if
Mrs.
Casaubon
will
not
object
to
the
delay
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
Dorothea
,
nothing
could
have
pleased
her
more
,
unless
it
had
*NL*
been
a
miraculous
voice
pronouncing
Mr.
Casaubon
the
wisest
and
*NL*
worthiest
among
the
sons
of
men
.
In
that
case
her
tottering
faith
*NL*
would
have
become
firm
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Naumann
's
apparatus
was
at
hand
in
wonderful
completeness
,
and
the
*NL*
sketch
went
on
at
once
as
well
as
the
conversation
.
Dorothea
sat
down
*NL*
and
subsided
into
calm
silence
,
feeling
happier
than
she
had
done
for
a
*NL*
long
while
before
.
Every
one
about
her
seemed
good
,
and
she
said
to
*NL*
herself
that
Rome
,
if
she
had
only
been
less
ignorant
,
would
have
been
*NL*
full
of
beauty
:
its
sadness
would
have
been
winged
with
hope
.
No
nature
*NL*
could
be
less
suspicious
than
hers
:
when
she
was
a
child
she
believed
*NL*
in
the
gratitude
of
wasps
and
the
honorable
susceptibility
of
sparrows
,
*NL*
and
was
proportionately
indignant
when
their
baseness
was
made
manifest
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
adroit
artist
was
asking
Mr.
Casaubon
questions
about
English
*NL*
polities
,
which
brought
long
answers
,
and
,
Will
meanwhile
had
perched
*NL*
himself
on
some
steps
in
the
background
overlooking
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
Presently
Naumann
said
--
``
Now
if
I
could
lay
this
by
for
half
an
hour
*NL*
and
take
it
up
again
--
come
and
look
,
Ladislaw
--
I
think
it
is
perfect
so
*NL*
far
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Will
vented
those
adjuring
interjections
which
imply
that
admiration
is
*NL*
too
strong
for
syntax
;
and
Naumann
said
in
a
tone
of
piteous
regret
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
--
now
--
if
I
could
but
have
had
more
--
but
you
have
other
*NL*
engagements
--
I
could
not
ask
it
--
or
even
to
come
again
to-morrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
let
us
stay
!
''
said
Dorothea
.
``
We
have
nothing
to
do
to-day
except
*NL*
go
about
,
have
we
?
''
she
added
,
looking
entreatingly
at
Mr.
Casaubon
.
*NL*
``
It
would
be
a
pity
not
to
make
the
head
as
good
as
possible
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
at
your
service
,
sir
,
in
the
matter
,
''
said
Mr.
Casaubon
,
with
*NL*
polite
condescension
.
``
Having
given
up
the
interior
of
my
head
to
*NL*
idleness
,
it
is
as
well
that
the
exterior
should
work
in
this
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
unspeakably
good
--
now
I
am
happy
!
''
said
Naumann
,
and
then
went
*NL*
on
in
German
to
Will
,
pointing
here
and
there
to
the
sketch
as
if
he
*NL*
were
considering
that
.
Putting
it
aside
for
a
moment
,
he
looked
round
*NL*
vaguely
,
as
if
seeking
some
occupation
for
his
visitors
,
and
afterwards
*NL*
turning
to
Mr.
Casaubon
,
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
the
beautiful
bride
,
the
gracious
lady
,
would
not
be
unwilling
*NL*
to
let
me
fill
up
the
time
by
trying
to
make
a
slight
sketch
of
*NL*
her
--
not
,
of
course
,
as
you
see
,
for
that
picture
--
only
as
a
single
*NL*
study
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Casaubon
,
bowing
,
doubted
not
that
Mrs.
Casaubon
would
oblige
him
,
*NL*
and
Dorothea
said
,
at
once
,
``
Where
shall
I
put
myself
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Naumann
was
all
apologies
in
asking
her
to
stand
,
and
allow
him
to
*NL*
adjust
her
attitude
,
to
which
she
submitted
without
any
of
the
affected
*NL*
airs
and
laughs
frequently
thought
necessary
on
such
occasions
,
when
*NL*
the
painter
said
,
``
It
is
as
Santa
Clara
that
I
want
you
to
*NL*
stand
--
leaning
so
,
with
your
cheek
against
your
hand
--
so
--
looking
at
*NL*
that
stool
,
please
,
so
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Will
was
divided
between
the
inclination
to
fall
at
the
Saint
's
feet
*NL*
and
kiss
her
robe
,
and
the
temptation
to
knock
Naumann
down
while
he
*NL*
was
adjusting
her
arm
.
All
this
was
impudence
and
desecration
,
and
he
*NL*
repented
that
he
had
brought
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
artist
was
diligent
,
and
Will
recovering
himself
moved
about
and
*NL*
occupied
Mr.
Casaubon
as
ingeniously
as
he
could
;
but
he
did
not
in
the
*NL*
end
prevent
the
time
from
seeming
long
to
that
gentleman
,
as
was
clear
*NL*
from
his
expressing
a
fear
that
Mrs.
Casaubon
would
be
tired
.
Naumann
*NL*
took
the
hint
and
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
sir
,
if
you
can
oblige
me
again
;
I
will
release
the
lady-wife
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
Mr.
Casaubon
's
patience
held
out
further
,
and
when
after
all
it
*NL*
turned
out
that
the
head
of
Saint
Thomas
Aquinas
would
be
more
perfect
*NL*
if
another
sitting
could
be
had
,
it
was
granted
for
the
morrow
.
On
the
*NL*
morrow
Santa
Clara
too
was
retouched
more
than
once
.
The
result
of
all
*NL*
was
so
far
from
displeasing
to
Mr.
Casaubon
,
that
he
arranged
for
the
*NL*
purchase
of
the
picture
in
which
Saint
Thomas
Aquinas
sat
among
the
*NL*
doctors
of
the
Church
in
a
disputation
too
abstract
to
be
represented
,
*NL*
but
listened
to
with
more
or
less
attention
by
an
audience
above
.
The
*NL*
Santa
Clara
,
which
was
spoken
of
in
the
second
place
,
Naumann
declared
*NL*
himself
to
be
dissatisfied
with
--
he
could
not
,
in
conscience
,
engage
*NL*
to
make
a
worthy
picture
of
it
;
so
about
the
Santa
Clara
the
*NL*
arrangement
was
conditional
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
will
not
dwell
on
Naumann
's
jokes
at
the
expense
of
Mr.
Casaubon
that
*NL*
evening
,
or
on
his
dithyrambs
about
Dorothea
's
charm
,
in
all
which
Will
*NL*
joined
,
but
with
a
difference
.
No
sooner
did
Naumann
mention
any
*NL*
detail
of
Dorothea
's
beauty
,
than
Will
got
exasperated
at
his
*NL*
presumption
:
there
was
grossness
in
his
choice
of
the
most
ordinary
*NL*
words
,
and
what
business
had
he
to
talk
of
her
lips
?
She
was
not
a
*NL*
woman
to
be
spoken
of
as
other
women
were
.
Will
could
not
say
just
*NL*
what
he
thought
,
but
he
became
irritable
.
And
yet
,
when
after
some
*NL*
resistance
he
had
consented
to
take
the
Casaubons
to
his
friend
's
*NL*
studio
,
he
had
been
allured
by
the
gratification
of
his
pride
in
being
*NL*
the
person
who
could
grant
Naumann
such
an
opportunity
of
studying
her
*NL*
loveliness
--
or
rather
her
divineness
,
for
the
ordinary
phrases
which
*NL*
might
apply
to
mere
bodily
prettiness
were
not
applicable
to
her
.
*NL*
-LRB-
Certainly
all
Tipton
and
its
neighborhood
,
as
well
as
Dorothea
*NL*
herself
,
would
have
been
surprised
at
her
beauty
being
made
so
much
of
.
*NL*
In
that
part
of
the
world
Miss
Brooke
had
been
only
a
``
fine
young
*NL*
woman
.
''
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oblige
me
by
letting
the
subject
drop
,
Naumann
.
Mrs.
Casaubon
is
not
*NL*
to
be
talked
of
as
if
she
were
a
model
,
''
said
Will
.
Naumann
stared
at
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Schon
!
I
will
talk
of
my
Aquinas
.
The
head
is
not
a
bad
type
,
after
*NL*
all
.
I
dare
say
the
great
scholastic
himself
would
have
been
flattered
*NL*
to
have
his
portrait
asked
for
.
Nothing
like
these
starchy
doctors
for
*NL*
vanity
!
It
was
as
I
thought
:
he
cared
much
less
for
her
portrait
than
*NL*
his
own
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
a
cursed
white-blooded
pedantic
coxcomb
,
''
said
Will
,
with
*NL*
gnashing
impetuosity
.
His
obligations
to
Mr.
Casaubon
were
not
known
*NL*
to
his
hearer
,
but
Will
himself
was
thinking
of
them
,
and
wishing
that
*NL*
he
could
discharge
them
all
by
a
check
.
*NL*
*NL*
Naumann
gave
a
shrug
and
said
,
``
It
is
good
they
go
away
soon
,
my
dear
.
*NL*
They
are
spoiling
your
fine
temper
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
Will
's
hope
and
contrivance
were
now
concentrated
on
seeing
*NL*
Dorothea
when
she
was
alone
.
He
only
wanted
her
to
take
more
emphatic
*NL*
notice
of
him
;
he
only
wanted
to
be
something
more
special
in
her
*NL*
remembrance
than
he
could
yet
believe
himself
likely
to
be
.
He
was
*NL*
rather
impatient
under
that
open
ardent
good-will
,
which
he
saw
was
her
*NL*
usual
state
of
feeling
.
The
remote
worship
of
a
woman
throned
out
of
*NL*
their
reach
plays
a
great
part
in
men
's
lives
,
but
in
most
cases
the
*NL*
worshipper
longs
for
some
queenly
recognition
,
some
approving
sign
by
*NL*
which
his
soul
's
sovereign
may
cheer
him
without
descending
from
her
*NL*
high
place
.
That
was
precisely
what
Will
wanted
.
But
there
were
*NL*
plenty
of
contradictions
in
his
imaginative
demands
.
It
was
beautiful
*NL*
to
see
how
Dorothea
's
eyes
turned
with
wifely
anxiety
and
beseeching
to
*NL*
Mr.
Casaubon
:
she
would
have
lost
some
of
her
halo
if
she
had
been
*NL*
without
that
duteous
preoccupation
;
and
yet
at
the
next
moment
the
*NL*
husband
's
sandy
absorption
of
such
nectar
was
too
intolerable
;
and
*NL*
Will
's
longing
to
say
damaging
things
about
him
was
perhaps
not
the
*NL*
less
tormenting
because
he
felt
the
strongest
reasons
for
restraining
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Will
had
not
been
invited
to
dine
the
next
day
.
Hence
he
persuaded
*NL*
himself
that
he
was
bound
to
call
,
and
that
the
only
eligible
time
was
*NL*
the
middle
of
the
day
,
when
Mr.
Casaubon
would
not
be
at
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
,
who
had
not
been
made
aware
that
her
former
reception
of
Will
*NL*
had
displeased
her
husband
,
had
no
hesitation
about
seeing
him
,
*NL*
especially
as
he
might
be
come
to
pay
a
farewell
visit
.
When
he
*NL*
entered
she
was
looking
at
some
cameos
which
she
had
been
buying
for
*NL*
Celia
.
She
greeted
Will
as
if
his
visit
were
quite
a
matter
of
course
,
*NL*
and
said
at
once
,
having
a
cameo
bracelet
in
her
hand
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
so
glad
you
are
come
.
Perhaps
you
understand
all
about
cameos
,
*NL*
and
can
tell
me
if
these
are
really
good
.
I
wished
to
have
you
with
us
*NL*
in
choosing
them
,
but
Mr.
Casaubon
objected
:
he
thought
there
was
not
*NL*
time
.
He
will
finish
his
work
to-morrow
,
and
we
shall
go
away
in
three
*NL*
days
.
I
have
been
uneasy
about
these
cameos
.
Pray
sit
down
and
look
*NL*
at
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
particularly
knowing
,
but
there
can
be
no
great
mistake
about
*NL*
these
little
Homeric
bits
:
they
are
exquisitely
neat
.
And
the
color
is
*NL*
fine
:
it
will
just
suit
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
they
are
for
my
sister
,
who
has
quite
a
different
complexion
.
You
*NL*
saw
her
with
me
at
Lowick
:
she
is
light-haired
and
very
pretty
--
at
*NL*
least
I
think
so
.
We
were
never
so
long
away
from
each
other
in
our
*NL*
lives
before
.
She
is
a
great
pet
and
never
was
naughty
in
her
life
.
I
*NL*
found
out
before
I
came
away
that
she
wanted
me
to
buy
her
some
cameos
,
*NL*
and
I
should
be
sorry
for
them
not
to
be
good
--
after
their
kind
.
''
*NL*
Dorothea
added
the
last
words
with
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
seem
not
to
care
about
cameos
,
''
said
Will
,
seating
himself
at
some
*NL*
distance
from
her
,
and
observing
her
while
she
closed
the
cases
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
frankly
,
I
do
n't
think
them
a
great
object
in
life
,
''
said
Dorothea
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
fear
you
are
a
heretic
about
art
generally
.
How
is
that
?
I
should
*NL*
have
expected
you
to
be
very
sensitive
to
the
beautiful
everywhere
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
I
am
dull
about
many
things
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
simply
.
``
I
*NL*
should
like
to
make
life
beautiful
--
I
mean
everybody
's
life
.
And
then
*NL*
all
this
immense
expense
of
art
,
that
seems
somehow
to
lie
outside
life
*NL*
and
make
it
no
better
for
the
world
,
pains
one
.
It
spoils
my
enjoyment
*NL*
of
anything
when
I
am
made
to
think
that
most
people
are
shut
out
from
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
call
that
the
fanaticism
of
sympathy
,
''
said
Will
,
impetuously
.
``
You
*NL*
might
say
the
same
of
landscape
,
of
poetry
,
of
all
refinement
.
If
you
*NL*
carried
it
out
you
ought
to
be
miserable
in
your
own
goodness
,
and
turn
*NL*
evil
that
you
might
have
no
advantage
over
others
.
The
best
piety
is
*NL*
to
enjoy
--
when
you
can
.
You
are
doing
the
most
then
to
save
the
*NL*
earth
's
character
as
an
agreeable
planet
.
And
enjoyment
radiates
.
It
*NL*
is
of
no
use
to
try
and
take
care
of
all
the
world
;
that
is
being
taken
*NL*
care
of
when
you
feel
delight
--
in
art
or
in
anything
else
.
Would
you
*NL*
turn
all
the
youth
of
the
world
into
a
tragic
chorus
,
wailing
and
*NL*
moralizing
over
misery
?
I
suspect
that
you
have
some
false
belief
in
*NL*
the
virtues
of
misery
,
and
want
to
make
your
life
a
martyrdom
.
''
Will
*NL*
had
gone
further
than
he
intended
,
and
checked
himself
.
But
Dorothea
's
*NL*
thought
was
not
taking
just
the
same
direction
as
his
own
,
and
she
*NL*
answered
without
any
special
emotion
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
you
mistake
me
.
I
am
not
a
sad
,
melancholy
creature
.
I
am
*NL*
never
unhappy
long
together
.
I
am
angry
and
naughty
--
not
like
Celia
:
I
*NL*
have
a
great
outburst
,
and
then
all
seems
glorious
again
.
I
can
not
*NL*
help
believing
in
glorious
things
in
a
blind
sort
of
way
.
I
should
be
*NL*
quite
willing
to
enjoy
the
art
here
,
but
there
is
so
much
that
I
do
n't
*NL*
know
the
reason
of
--
so
much
that
seems
to
me
a
consecration
of
ugliness
*NL*
rather
than
beauty
.
The
painting
and
sculpture
may
be
wonderful
,
but
*NL*
the
feeling
is
often
low
and
brutal
,
and
sometimes
even
ridiculous
.
*NL*
Here
and
there
I
see
what
takes
me
at
once
as
noble
--
something
that
I
*NL*
might
compare
with
the
Alban
Mountains
or
the
sunset
from
the
Pincian
*NL*
Hill
;
but
that
makes
it
the
greater
pity
that
there
is
so
little
of
the
*NL*
best
kind
among
all
that
mass
of
things
over
which
men
have
toiled
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
there
is
always
a
great
deal
of
poor
work
:
the
rarer
things
*NL*
want
that
soil
to
grow
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
dear
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
taking
up
that
thought
into
the
chief
current
*NL*
of
her
anxiety
;
``
I
see
it
must
be
very
difficult
to
do
anything
good
.
*NL*
I
have
often
felt
since
I
have
been
in
Rome
that
most
of
our
lives
*NL*
would
look
much
uglier
and
more
bungling
than
the
pictures
,
if
they
*NL*
could
be
put
on
the
wall
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
parted
her
lips
again
as
if
she
were
going
to
say
more
,
but
*NL*
changed
her
mind
and
paused
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
too
young
--
it
is
an
anachronism
for
you
to
have
such
*NL*
thoughts
,
''
said
Will
,
energetically
,
with
a
quick
shake
of
the
head
*NL*
habitual
to
him
.
``
You
talk
as
if
you
had
never
known
any
youth
.
It
is
*NL*
monstrous
--
as
if
you
had
had
a
vision
of
Hades
in
your
childhood
,
like
*NL*
the
boy
in
the
legend
.
You
have
been
brought
up
in
some
of
those
*NL*
horrible
notions
that
choose
the
sweetest
women
to
devour
--
like
*NL*
Minotaurs
.
And
now
you
will
go
and
be
shut
up
in
that
stone
prison
at
*NL*
Lowick
:
you
will
be
buried
alive
.
It
makes
me
savage
to
think
of
it
!
*NL*
I
would
rather
never
have
seen
you
than
think
of
you
with
such
a
*NL*
prospect
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Will
again
feared
that
he
had
gone
too
far
;
but
the
meaning
we
attach
*NL*
to
words
depends
on
our
feeling
,
and
his
tone
of
angry
regret
had
so
*NL*
much
kindness
in
it
for
Dorothea
's
heart
,
which
had
always
been
giving
*NL*
out
ardor
and
had
never
been
fed
with
much
from
the
living
beings
*NL*
around
her
,
that
she
felt
a
new
sense
of
gratitude
and
answered
with
a
*NL*
gentle
smile
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
very
good
of
you
to
be
anxious
about
me
.
It
is
because
you
did
*NL*
not
like
Lowick
yourself
:
you
had
set
your
heart
on
another
kind
of
*NL*
life
.
But
Lowick
is
my
chosen
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
last
sentence
was
spoken
with
an
almost
solemn
cadence
,
and
Will
*NL*
did
not
know
what
to
say
,
since
it
would
not
be
useful
for
him
to
*NL*
embrace
her
slippers
,
and
tell
her
that
he
would
die
for
her
:
it
was
*NL*
clear
that
she
required
nothing
of
the
sort
;
and
they
were
both
silent
*NL*
for
a
moment
or
two
,
when
Dorothea
began
again
with
an
air
of
saying
at
*NL*
last
what
had
been
in
her
mind
beforehand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wanted
to
ask
you
again
about
something
you
said
the
other
day
.
*NL*
Perhaps
it
was
half
of
it
your
lively
way
of
speaking
:
I
notice
that
*NL*
you
like
to
put
things
strongly
;
I
myself
often
exaggerate
when
I
speak
*NL*
hastily
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
was
it
?
''
said
Will
,
observing
that
she
spoke
with
a
timidity
*NL*
quite
new
in
her
.
``
I
have
a
hyperbolical
tongue
:
it
catches
fire
as
it
*NL*
goes
.
I
dare
say
I
shall
have
to
retract
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
mean
what
you
said
about
the
necessity
of
knowing
German
--
I
mean
,
*NL*
for
the
subjects
that
Mr.
Casaubon
is
engaged
in
.
I
have
been
thinking
*NL*
about
it
;
and
it
seems
to
me
that
with
Mr.
Casaubon
's
learning
he
must
*NL*
have
before
him
the
same
materials
as
German
scholars
--
has
he
not
?
''
*NL*
Dorothea
's
timidity
was
due
to
an
indistinct
consciousness
that
she
was
*NL*
in
the
strange
situation
of
consulting
a
third
person
about
the
*NL*
adequacy
of
Mr.
Casaubon
's
learning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
exactly
the
same
materials
,
''
said
Will
,
thinking
that
he
would
be
*NL*
duly
reserved
.
``
He
is
not
an
Orientalist
,
you
know
.
He
does
not
*NL*
profess
to
have
more
than
second-hand
knowledge
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
there
are
very
valuable
books
about
antiquities
which
were
written
*NL*
a
long
while
ago
by
scholars
who
knew
nothing
about
these
modern
*NL*
things
;
and
they
are
still
used
.
Why
should
Mr.
Casaubon
's
not
be
*NL*
valuable
,
like
theirs
?
''
said
Dorothea
,
with
more
remonstrant
energy
.
*NL*
She
was
impelled
to
have
the
argument
aloud
,
which
she
had
been
having
*NL*
in
her
own
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
depends
on
the
line
of
study
taken
,
''
said
Will
,
also
getting
a
*NL*
tone
of
rejoinder
.
``
The
subject
Mr.
Casaubon
has
chosen
is
as
changing
*NL*
as
chemistry
:
new
discoveries
are
constantly
making
new
points
of
view
.
*NL*
Who
wants
a
system
on
the
basis
of
the
four
elements
,
or
a
book
to
*NL*
refute
Paracelsus
?
Do
you
not
see
that
it
is
no
use
now
to
be
crawling
*NL*
a
little
way
after
men
of
the
last
century
--
men
like
Bryant
--
and
*NL*
correcting
their
mistakes
?
--
living
in
a
lumber-room
and
furbishing
up
*NL*
broken-legged
theories
about
Chus
and
Mizraim
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
you
bear
to
speak
so
lightly
?
''
said
Dorothea
,
with
a
look
*NL*
between
sorrow
and
anger
.
``
If
it
were
as
you
say
,
what
could
be
sadder
*NL*
than
so
much
ardent
labor
all
in
vain
?
I
wonder
it
does
not
affect
you
*NL*
more
painfully
,
if
you
really
think
that
a
man
like
Mr.
Casaubon
,
of
so
*NL*
much
goodness
,
power
,
and
learning
,
should
in
any
way
fail
in
what
has
*NL*
been
the
labor
of
his
best
years
.
''
She
was
beginning
to
be
shocked
that
*NL*
she
had
got
to
such
a
point
of
supposition
,
and
indignant
with
Will
for
*NL*
having
led
her
to
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
questioned
me
about
the
matter
of
fact
,
not
of
feeling
,
''
said
*NL*
Will
.
``
But
if
you
wish
to
punish
me
for
the
fact
,
I
submit
.
I
am
not
*NL*
in
a
position
to
express
my
feeling
toward
Mr.
Casaubon
:
it
would
be
at
*NL*
best
a
pensioner
's
eulogy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pray
excuse
me
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
coloring
deeply
.
``
I
am
aware
,
as
you
*NL*
say
,
that
I
am
in
fault
in
having
introduced
the
subject
.
Indeed
,
I
am
*NL*
wrong
altogether
.
Failure
after
long
perseverance
is
much
grander
than
*NL*
never
to
have
a
striving
good
enough
to
be
called
a
failure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
quite
agree
with
you
,
''
said
Will
,
determined
to
change
the
*NL*
situation
--
``
so
much
so
that
I
have
made
up
my
mind
not
to
run
that
*NL*
risk
of
never
attaining
a
failure
.
Mr.
Casaubon
's
generosity
has
*NL*
perhaps
been
dangerous
to
me
,
and
I
mean
to
renounce
the
liberty
it
has
*NL*
given
me
.
I
mean
to
go
back
to
England
shortly
and
work
my
own
*NL*
way

depend
on
nobody
else
than
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
fine
--
I
respect
that
feeling
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
with
returning
*NL*
kindness
.
``
But
Mr.
Casaubon
,
I
am
sure
,
has
never
thought
of
anything
*NL*
in
the
matter
except
what
was
most
for
your
welfare
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
has
obstinacy
and
pride
enough
to
serve
instead
of
love
,
now
she
*NL*
has
married
him

said
Will
to
himself
.
Aloud
he
said
,
rising
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
not
see
you
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
stay
till
Mr.
Casaubon
comes
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
earnestly
.
``
I
am
so
*NL*
glad
we
met
in
Rome
.
I
wanted
to
know
you

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
have
made
you
angry

said
Will
.
``
I

made
you

ill

me

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no

My
sister
tells
me
I
am
always
angry
with
people
who
do
not
*NL*
say
just
what
I
like

But
I
hope
I
am
not
given
to
think
ill
of
them

*NL*
In
the
end
I
am
usually
obliged
to
think
ill
of
myself
for
being
so
*NL*
impatient
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Still
,
you
do
n't
like
me

I
have
made
myself
an
unpleasant
thought
to
*NL*
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all

said
Dorothea
,
with
the
most
open
kindness
.
``
I
like
you
*NL*
very
much

*NL*
*NL*
Will
was
not
quite
contented
,
thinking
that
he
would
apparently
have
*NL*
been
of
more
importance
if
he
had
been
disliked
.
He
said
nothing
,
but
*NL*
looked
dull
,
not
to
say
sulky
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
am
quite
interested
to
see
what
you
will
do
,
''
Dorothea
went
on
*NL*
cheerfully
.
``
I
believe
devoutly
in
a
natural
difference
of
vocation

*NL*
If
it
were
not
for
that
belief
,
I
suppose
I
should
be
very
narrow
--
there
*NL*
are
so
many
things
,
besides
painting
,
that
I
am
quite
ignorant
*NL*
of
.
You
would
hardly
believe
how
little
I
have
taken
in
of
music
and
*NL*
literature
,
which
you
know
so
much
of
.
I
wonder
what
your
vocation
*NL*
will
turn
out
to
be
:
perhaps
you
will
be
a
poet
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
depends
.
To
be
a
poet
is
to
have
a
soul
so
quick
to
discern
that
*NL*
no
shade
of
quality
escapes
it
,
and
so
quick
to
feel
,
that
discernment
*NL*
is
but
a
hand
playing
with
finely
ordered
variety
on
the
chords
of
*NL*
emotion
--
a
soul
in
which
knowledge
passes
instantaneously
into
feeling
,
*NL*
and
feeling
flashes
back
as
a
new
organ
of
knowledge
.
One
may
have
*NL*
that
condition
by
fits
only
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
leave
out
the
poems
,
''
said
Dorothea
.
``
I
think
they
are
wanted
*NL*
to
complete
the
poet

I
understand
what
you
mean
about
knowledge

passing
into
feeling

for
that
seems
to
be
just
what
I
experience

*NL*
``
You

a

that
is

what

makes
up
the
poet

consciousness
in
his

said
Will
,
*NL*
showing
such
originality
as
we
all
share
with
the
morning
and
the
*NL*
spring-time
and
other
endless
renewals
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
glad
to
hear
it

said
Dorothea
,
laughing
out
her
words
in
a
*NL*
bird-like
modulation
,
and
looking
at
Will
with
playful
gratitude
in
her
*NL*
eyes
.
``
What
very
kind
things
you
say
to
me
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish

service

I
fear
I

never

Will
spoke
with
fervor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
cordially
.
``
It
will
come
;
and
I
shall
*NL*
remember
how
well
you
wish
me

I
quite
hoped
that
we

be
friends
*NL*
when
I
first
saw
you
--
because
of
your
relationship
to
Mr.
Casaubon
.
''
*NL*
There
was
a
certain
liquid
brightness
in
her
eyes
,
and
Will
was
*NL*
conscious
that
his
own
were
obeying
a
law
of
nature
and
filling
too
.
*NL*
The
allusion
to
Mr.
Casaubon
would
have
spoiled
all
if
anything
at
that
*NL*
moment
could
have
spoiled
the
subduing
power
,
the
sweet
dignity
,
of
her
*NL*
noble
unsuspicious
inexperience
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
there
is
one
thing
even
now
that
you
can
do
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
*NL*
rising
and
walking
a
little
way
under
the
strength
of
a
recurring
*NL*
impulse
.
``
Promise
me
that
you
will
not
again
,
to
any
one

speak
of
*NL*
that
subject

I
mean
about
Mr.

's
writings
--
I
mean
in
that
*NL*
kind
of
way
.
It
was
I
who
led
to
it
.
It
was
my
fault

But
promise
*NL*
me

*NL*
*NL*
She
had
returned
from
her
brief
pacing
and
stood
opposite
Will
,
looking
*NL*
gravely
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
,
I
will
promise
you
,
''
said
Will
,
reddening
however
.
If
he
*NL*
never
said
a
cutting
word
about
Mr.
Casaubon
again
and
left
off
*NL*
receiving
favors
from
him
,
it
would
clearly
be
permissible
to
hate
him
*NL*
the
more
.
The
poet
must
know
how
to
hate
,
says
Goethe
;
and
Will
was
at
*NL*
least
ready
with
that
accomplishment
.
He
said
that
he
must
go
now
*NL*
without
waiting
for
Mr.
Casaubon
,
whom
he
would
come
to
take
leave
of
*NL*
at
the
last
moment
.
Dorothea
gave
him
her
hand
,
and
they
exchanged
a
*NL*
simple
``
Good-by
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
going
out
of
the
porte
cochere
he
met
Mr.
Casaubon
,
and
that
*NL*
gentleman
,
expressing
the
best
wishes
for
his
cousin
,
politely
waived
*NL*
the
pleasure
of
any
further
leave-taking
on
the
morrow
,
which
would
be
*NL*
sufficiently
crowded
with
the
preparations
for
departure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
something
to
tell
you
about
our
cousin
Mr.
Ladislaw
,
which
I
*NL*
think
will
heighten
your
opinion
of
him
,
''
said
Dorothea
to
her
husband
*NL*
in
the
coarse
of
the
evening
.
She
had
mentioned
immediately
on
his
*NL*
entering
that
Will
had
just
gone
away
,
and
would
come
again
,
but
Mr.
*NL*
Casaubon
had
said
,
``
I
met
him
outside
,
and
we
made
our
final
adieux
,
I
*NL*
believe
,
''
saying
this
with
the
air
and
tone
by
which
we
imply
that
any
*NL*
subject
,
whether
private
or
public
,
does
not
interest
us
enough
to
wish
*NL*
for
a
further
remark
upon
it
.
So
Dorothea
had
waited
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
that
,
my
love
?
''
said
Mr
Casaubon
-LRB-
he
always
said
``
my
love
''
*NL*
when
his
manner
was
the
coldest
-RRB-
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
made
up
his
mind
to
leave
off
wandering
at
once
,
and
to
give
up
*NL*
his
dependence
on
your
generosity
.
He
means
soon
to
go
back
to
*NL*
England
,
and
work
his
own
way
.
I
thought
you
would
consider
that
a
*NL*
good
sign

said
Dorothea
,
with
an
appealing
look
into
her
husband
's
*NL*
neutral
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
he
mention
the

*NL*
*NL*
Fred
Vincy
,
we
have
seen
,
had
a
debt
on
his
mind
,
and
though
no
such
*NL*
immaterial
burthen
could
depress
that
buoyant-hearted
young
gentleman
*NL*
for
many
hours
together
,
there
were
circumstances
connected
with
this
*NL*
debt
which
made
the
thought
of
it
unusually
importunate
.
The
creditor
*NL*
was
Mr.
Bambridge
a
horse-dealer
of
the
neighborhood
,
whose
company
was
*NL*
much
sought
in
Middlemarch
by
young
men
understood
to
be
``
addicted
to
*NL*
pleasure
.
''
During
the
vacations
Fred
had
naturally
required
more
*NL*
amusements
than
he
had
ready
money
for
,
and
Mr.
Bambridge
had
been
*NL*
accommodating
enough
not
only
to
trust
him
for
the
hire
of
horses
and
*NL*
the
accidental
expense
of
ruining
a
fine
hunter
,
but
also
to
make
a
*NL*
small
advance
by
which
he
might
be
able
to
meet
some
losses
at
*NL*
billiards
.
The
total
debt
was
a
hundred
and
sixty
pounds
.
Bambridge
*NL*
was
in
no
alarm
about
his
money
,
being
sure
that
young
Vincy
had
*NL*
backers
;
but
he
had
required
something
to
show
for
it
,
and
Fred
had
at
*NL*
first
given
a
bill
with
his
own
signature
.
Three
months
later
he
had
*NL*
renewed
this
bill
with
the
signature
of
Caleb
Garth
.
On
both
occasions
*NL*
Fred
had
felt
confident
that
he
should
meet
the
bill
himself
,
having
*NL*
ample
funds
at
disposal
in
his
own
hopefulness
.
You
will
hardly
demand
*NL*
that
his
confidence
should
have
a
basis
in
external
facts
;
such
*NL*
confidence
,
we
know
,
is
something
less
coarse
and
materialistic
:
it
is
*NL*
a
comfortable
disposition
leading
us
to
expect
that
the
wisdom
of
*NL*
providence
or
the
folly
of
our
friends
,
the
mysteries
of
luck
or
the
*NL*
still
greater
mystery
of
our
high
individual
value
in
the
universe
,
*NL*
will
bring
about
agreeable
issues
,
such
as
are
consistent
with
our
good
*NL*
taste
in
costume
,
and
our
general
preference
for
the
best
style
of
*NL*
thing
.
Fred
felt
sure
that
he
should
have
a
present
from
his
uncle
,
*NL*
that
he
should
have
a
run
of
luck
,
that
by
dint
of
``
swapping
''
he
should
*NL*
gradually
metamorphose
a
horse
worth
forty
pounds
into
a
horse
that
*NL*
would
fetch
a
hundred
at
any
moment
--
``
judgment
''
being
always
equivalent
*NL*
to
an
unspecified
sum
in
hard
cash
.
And
in
any
case
,
even
supposing
*NL*
negations
which
only
a
morbid
distrust
could
imagine
,
Fred
had
always
*NL*
-LRB-
at
that
time
-RRB-
his
father
's
pocket
as
a
last
resource
,
so
that
his
*NL*
assets
of
hopefulness
had
a
sort
of
gorgeous
superfluity
about
them
.
*NL*
Of
what
might
be
the
capacity
of
his
father
's
pocket
,
Fred
had
only
a
*NL*
vague
notion
:
was
not
trade
elastic
?
And
would
not
the
deficiencies
of
*NL*
one
year
be
made
up
for
by
the
surplus
of
another
?
The
Vincys
lived
in
*NL*
an
easy
profuse
way
,
not
with
any
new
ostentation
,
but
according
to
the
*NL*
family
habits
and
traditions
,
so
that
the
children
had
no
standard
of
*NL*
economy
,
and
the
elder
ones
retained
some
of
their
infantine
notion
*NL*
that
their
father
might
pay
for
anything
if
he
would
.
Mr.
Vincy
*NL*
himself
had
expensive
Middlemarch
habits
--
spent
money
on
coursing
,
on
*NL*
his
cellar
,
and
on
dinner-giving
,
while
mamma
had
those
running
*NL*
accounts
with
tradespeople
,
which
give
a
cheerful
sense
of
getting
*NL*
everything
one
wants
without
any
question
of
payment
.
But
it
was
in
*NL*
the
nature
of
fathers
,
Fred
knew
,
to
bully
one
about
expenses
:
there
*NL*
was
always
a
little
storm
over
his
extravagance
if
he
had
to
disclose
a
*NL*
debt
,
and
Fred
disliked
bad
weather
within
doors
.
He
was
too
filial
to
*NL*
be
disrespectful
to
his
father
,
and
he
bore
the
thunder
with
the
*NL*
certainty
that
it
was
transient
;
but
in
the
mean
time
it
was
*NL*
disagreeable
to
see
his
mother
cry
,
and
also
to
be
obliged
to
look
*NL*
sulky
instead
of
having
fun
;
for
Fred
was
so
good-tempered
that
if
he
*NL*
looked
glum
under
scolding
,
it
was
chiefly
for
propriety
's
sake
.
The
*NL*
easier
course
plainly
,
was
to
renew
the
bill
with
a
friend
's
signature
.
*NL*
Why
not
?
With
the
superfluous
securities
of
hope
at
his
command
,
there
*NL*
was
no
reason
why
he
should
not
have
increased
other
people
's
*NL*
liabilities
to
any
extent
,
but
for
the
fact
that
men
whose
names
were
*NL*
good
for
anything
were
usually
pessimists
,
indisposed
to
believe
that
*NL*
the
universal
order
of
things
would
necessarily
be
agreeable
to
an
*NL*
agreeable
young
gentleman
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
a
favor
to
ask
we
review
our
list
of
friends
,
do
justice
to
their
*NL*
more
amiable
qualities
,
forgive
their
little
offenses
,
and
concerning
*NL*
each
in
turn
,
try
to
arrive
at
the
conclusion
that
he
will
be
eager
to
*NL*
oblige
us
,
our
own
eagerness
to
be
obliged
being
as
communicable
as
*NL*
other
warmth
.
Still
there
is
always
a
certain
number
who
are
dismissed
*NL*
as
but
moderately
eager
until
the
others
have
refused
;
and
it
happened
*NL*
that
Fred
checked
off
all
his
friends
but
one
,
on
the
ground
that
*NL*
applying
to
them
would
be
disagreeable
;
being
implicitly
convinced
that
*NL*
he
at
least
-LRB-
whatever
might
be
maintained
about
mankind
generally
-RRB-
had
*NL*
a
right
to
be
free
from
anything
disagreeable
.
That
he
should
ever
*NL*
fall
into
a
thoroughly
unpleasant
position
--
wear
trousers
shrunk
with
*NL*
washing
,
eat
cold
mutton
,
have
to
walk
for
want
of
a
horse
,
or
to
``
duck
*NL*
under
''
in
any
sort
of
way
--
was
an
absurdity
irreconcilable
with
those
*NL*
cheerful
intuitions
implanted
in
him
by
nature
.
And
Fred
winced
under
*NL*
the
idea
of
being
looked
down
upon
as
wanting
funds
for
small
debts
.
*NL*
Thus
it
came
to
pass
that
the
friend
whom
he
chose
to
apply
to
was
at
*NL*
once
the
poorest
and
the
kindest
--
namely
,
Caleb
Garth
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Garths
were
very
fond
of
Fred
,
as
he
was
of
them
;
for
when
he
and
*NL*
Rosamond
were
little
ones
,
and
the
Garths
were
better
off
,
the
slight
*NL*
connection
between
the
two
families
through
Mr.
Featherstone
's
double
*NL*
marriage
-LRB-
the
first
to
Mr.
Garth
's
sister
,
and
the
second
to
Mrs.
*NL*
Vincy
's
-RRB-
had
led
to
an
acquaintance
which
was
carried
on
between
the
*NL*
children
rather
than
the
parents
:
the
children
drank
tea
together
out
*NL*
of
their
toy
teacups
,
and
spent
whole
days
together
in
play
.
Mary
was
*NL*
a
little
hoyden
,
and
Fred
at
six
years
old
thought
her
the
nicest
girl
*NL*
in
the
world
,
making
her
his
wife
with
a
brass
ring
which
he
had
cut
*NL*
from
an
umbrella
.
Through
all
the
stages
of
his
education
he
had
kept
*NL*
his
affection
for
the
Garths
,
and
his
habit
of
going
to
their
house
as
*NL*
a
second
home
,
though
any
intercourse
between
them
and
the
elders
of
*NL*
his
family
had
long
ceased
.
Even
when
Caleb
Garth
was
prosperous
,
the
*NL*
Vincys
were
on
condescending
terms
with
him
and
his
wife
,
for
there
*NL*
were
nice
distinctions
of
rank
in
Middlemarch
;
and
though
old
*NL*
manufacturers
could
not
any
more
than
dukes
be
connected
with
none
but
*NL*
equals
,
they
were
conscious
of
an
inherent
social
superiority
which
was
*NL*
defined
with
great
nicety
in
practice
,
though
hardly
expressible
*NL*
theoretically
.
Since
then
Mr.
Garth
had
failed
in
the
building
*NL*
business
,
which
he
had
unfortunately
added
to
his
other
avocations
of
*NL*
surveyor
,
valuer
,
and
agent
,
had
conducted
that
business
for
a
time
*NL*
entirely
for
the
benefit
of
his
assignees
,
and
had
been
living
*NL*
narrowly
,
exerting
himself
to
the
utmost
that
he
might
after
all
pay
*NL*
twenty
shillings
in
the
pound
.
He
had
now
achieved
this
,
and
from
all
*NL*
who
did
not
think
it
a
bad
precedent
,
his
honorable
exertions
had
won
*NL*
him
due
esteem
;
but
in
no
part
of
the
world
is
genteel
visiting
founded
*NL*
on
esteem
,
in
the
absence
of
suitable
furniture
and
complete
*NL*
dinner-service
.
Mrs.
Vincy
had
never
been
at
her
ease
with
Mrs.
Garth
,
*NL*
and
frequently
spoke
of
her
as
a
woman
who
had
had
to
work
for
her
*NL*
bread
--
meaning
that
Mrs.
Garth
had
been
a
teacher
before
her
marriage
;
*NL*
in
which
case
an
intimacy
with
Lindley
Murray
and
Mangnall
's
Questions
*NL*
was
something
like
a
draper
's
discrimination
of
calico
trademarks
,
or
a
*NL*
courier
's
acquaintance
with
foreign
countries
:
no
woman
who
was
better
*NL*
off
needed
that
sort
of
thing
.
And
since
Mary
had
been
keeping
Mr.
*NL*
Featherstone
's
house
,
Mrs.
Vincy
's
want
of
liking
for
the
Garths
had
*NL*
been
converted
into
something
more
positive
,
by
alarm
lest
Fred
should
*NL*
engage
himself
to
this
plain
girl
,
whose
parents
``
lived
in
such
a
small
*NL*
way
.
''
Fred
,
being
aware
of
this
,
never
spoke
at
home
of
his
visits
to
*NL*
Mrs.
Garth
,
which
had
of
late
become
more
frequent
,
the
increasing
*NL*
ardor
of
his
affection
for
Mary
inclining
him
the
more
towards
those
*NL*
who
belonged
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Garth
had
a
small
office
in
the
town
,
and
to
this
Fred
went
with
*NL*
his
request
.
He
obtained
it
without
much
difficulty
,
for
a
large
*NL*
amount
of
painful
experience
had
not
sufficed
to
make
Caleb
Garth
*NL*
cautious
about
his
own
affairs
,
or
distrustful
of
his
fellow-men
when
*NL*
they
had
not
proved
themselves
untrustworthy
;
and
he
had
the
highest
*NL*
opinion
of
Fred
,
was
``
sure
the
lad
would
turn
out
well
--
an
open
*NL*
affectionate
fellow
,
with
a
good
bottom
to
his
character
--
you
might
*NL*
trust
him
for
anything
.
''
Such
was
Caleb
's
psychological
argument
.
He
*NL*
was
one
of
those
rare
men
who
are
rigid
to
themselves
and
indulgent
to
*NL*
others
.
He
had
a
certain
shame
about
his
neighbors
'
errors
,
and
never
*NL*
spoke
of
them
willingly
;
hence
he
was
not
likely
to
divert
his
mind
*NL*
from
the
best
mode
of
hardening
timber
and
other
ingenious
devices
in
*NL*
order
to
preconceive
those
errors
.
If
he
had
to
blame
any
one
,
it
was
*NL*
necessary
for
him
to
move
all
the
papers
within
his
reach
,
or
describe
*NL*
various
diagrams
with
his
stick
,
or
make
calculations
with
the
odd
*NL*
money
in
his
pocket
,
before
he
could
begin
;
and
he
would
rather
do
*NL*
other
men
's
work
than
find
fault
with
their
doing
.
I
fear
he
was
a
bad
*NL*
disciplinarian
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Fred
stated
the
circumstances
of
his
debt
,
his
wish
to
meet
it
*NL*
without
troubling
his
father
,
and
the
certainty
that
the
money
would
be
*NL*
forthcoming
so
as
to
cause
no
one
any
inconvenience
,
Caleb
pushed
his
*NL*
spectacles
upward
,
listened
,
looked
into
his
favorite
's
clear
young
*NL*
eyes
,
and
believed
him
,
not
distinguishing
confidence
about
the
future
*NL*
from
veracity
about
the
past
;
but
he
felt
that
it
was
an
occasion
for
a
*NL*
friendly
hint
as
to
conduct
,
and
that
before
giving
his
signature
he
*NL*
must
give
a
rather
strong
admonition
.
Accordingly
,
he
took
the
paper
*NL*
and
lowered
his
spectacles
,
measured
the
space
at
his
command
,
reached
*NL*
his
pen
and
examined
it
,
dipped
it
in
the
ink
and
examined
it
again
,
*NL*
then
pushed
the
paper
a
little
way
from
him
,
lifted
up
his
spectacles
*NL*
again
,
showed
a
deepened
depression
in
the
outer
angle
of
his
bushy
*NL*
eyebrows
,
which
gave
his
face
a
peculiar
mildness
-LRB-
pardon
these
details
*NL*
for
once
--
you
would
have
learned
to
love
them
if
you
had
known
Caleb
*NL*
Garth
-RRB-
,
and
said
in
a
comfortable
tone
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
a
misfortune
,
eh
,
that
breaking
the
horse
's
knees
?
And
then
,
*NL*
these
exchanges
,
they
do
n't
answer
when
you
have
`
cute
jockeys
to
deal
*NL*
with
.
You
'll
be
wiser
another
time
,
my
boy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Whereupon
Caleb
drew
down
his
spectacles
,
and
proceeded
to
write
his
*NL*
signature
with
the
care
which
he
always
gave
to
that
performance
;
for
*NL*
whatever
he
did
in
the
way
of
business
he
did
well
.
He
contemplated
*NL*
the
large
well-proportioned
letters
and
final
flourish
,
with
his
head
a
*NL*
trifle
on
one
side
for
an
instant
,
then
handed
it
to
Fred
,
said
*NL*
``
Good-by
,
''
and
returned
forthwith
to
his
absorption
in
a
plan
for
Sir
*NL*
James
Chettam
's
new
farm-buildings
.
*NL*
*NL*
Either
because
his
interest
in
this
work
thrust
the
incident
of
the
*NL*
signature
from
his
memory
,
or
for
some
reason
of
which
Caleb
was
more
*NL*
conscious
,
Mrs.
Garth
remained
ignorant
of
the
affair
.
*NL*
*NL*
Since
it
occurred
,
a
change
had
come
over
Fred
's
sky
,
which
altered
his
*NL*
view
of
the
distance
,
and
was
the
reason
why
his
uncle
Featherstone
's
*NL*
present
of
money
was
of
importance
enough
to
make
his
color
come
and
*NL*
go
,
first
with
a
too
definite
expectation
,
and
afterwards
with
a
*NL*
proportionate
disappointment
.
His
failure
in
passing
his
examination
,
*NL*
had
made
his
accumulation
of
college
debts
the
more
unpardonable
by
his
*NL*
father
,
and
there
had
been
an
unprecedented
storm
at
home
.
Mr.
Vincy
*NL*
had
sworn
that
if
he
had
anything
more
of
that
sort
to
put
up
with
,
*NL*
Fred
should
turn
out
and
get
his
living
how
he
could
;
and
he
had
never
*NL*
yet
quite
recovered
his
good-humored
tone
to
his
son
,
who
had
*NL*
especially
enraged
him
by
saying
at
this
stage
of
things
that
he
did
*NL*
not
want
to
be
a
clergyman
,
and
would
rather
not
``
go
on
with
that
.
''
*NL*
Fred
was
conscious
that
he
would
have
been
yet
more
severely
dealt
with
*NL*
if
his
family
as
well
as
himself
had
not
secretly
regarded
him
as
Mr.
*NL*
Featherstone
's
heir
;
that
old
gentleman
's
pride
in
him
,
and
apparent
*NL*
fondness
for
him
,
serving
in
the
stead
of
more
exemplary
conduct
--
just
*NL*
as
when
a
youthful
nobleman
steals
jewellery
we
call
the
act
*NL*
kleptomania
,
speak
of
it
with
a
philosophical
smile
,
and
never
think
of
*NL*
his
being
sent
to
the
house
of
correction
as
if
he
were
a
ragged
boy
*NL*
who
had
stolen
turnips
.
In
fact
,
tacit
expectations
of
what
would
be
*NL*
done
for
him
by
uncle
Featherstone
determined
the
angle
at
which
most
*NL*
people
viewed
Fred
Vincy
in
Middlemarch
;
and
in
his
own
consciousness
,
*NL*
what
uncle
Featherstone
would
do
for
him
in
an
emergency
,
or
what
he
*NL*
would
do
simply
as
an
incorporated
luck
,
formed
always
an
immeasurable
*NL*
depth
of
aerial
perspective
.
But
that
present
of
bank-notes
,
once
*NL*
made
,
was
measurable
,
and
being
applied
to
the
amount
of
the
debt
,
*NL*
showed
a
deficit
which
had
still
to
be
filled
up
either
by
Fred
's
*NL*
``
judgment
''
or
by
luck
in
some
other
shape
.
For
that
little
episode
of
*NL*
the
alleged
borrowing
,
in
which
he
had
made
his
father
the
agent
in
*NL*
getting
the
Bulstrode
certificate
,
was
a
new
reason
against
going
to
*NL*
his
father
for
money
towards
meeting
his
actual
debt
.
Fred
was
keen
*NL*
enough
to
foresee
that
anger
would
confuse
distinctions
,
and
that
his
*NL*
denial
of
having
borrowed
expressly
on
the
strength
of
his
uncle
's
will
*NL*
would
be
taken
as
a
falsehood
.
He
had
gone
to
his
father
and
told
him
*NL*
one
vexatious
affair
,
and
he
had
left
another
untold
:
in
such
cases
the
*NL*
complete
revelation
always
produces
the
impression
of
a
previous
*NL*
duplicity
.
Now
Fred
piqued
himself
on
keeping
clear
of
lies
,
and
even
*NL*
fibs
;
he
often
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
made
a
significant
grimace
at
*NL*
what
he
called
Rosamond
's
fibs
-LRB-
it
is
only
brothers
who
can
associate
*NL*
such
ideas
with
a
lovely
girl
-RRB-
;
and
rather
than
incur
the
accusation
of
*NL*
falsehood
he
would
even
incur
some
trouble
and
self-restraint
.
It
was
*NL*
under
strong
inward
pressure
of
this
kind
that
Fred
had
taken
the
wise
*NL*
step
of
depositing
the
eighty
pounds
with
his
mother
.
It
was
a
pity
*NL*
that
he
had
not
at
once
given
them
to
Mr.
Garth
;
but
he
meant
to
make
*NL*
the
sum
complete
with
another
sixty
,
and
with
a
view
to
this
,
he
had
*NL*
kept
twenty
pounds
in
his
own
pocket
as
a
sort
of
seed-corn
,
which
,
*NL*
planted
by
judgment
,
and
watered
by
luck
,
might
yield
more
than
*NL*
threefold
--
a
very
poor
rate
of
multiplication
when
the
field
is
a
young
*NL*
gentleman
's
infinite
soul
,
with
all
the
numerals
at
command
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fred
was
not
a
gambler
:
he
had
not
that
specific
disease
in
which
the
*NL*
suspension
of
the
whole
nervous
energy
on
a
chance
or
risk
becomes
as
*NL*
necessary
as
the
dram
to
the
drunkard
;
he
had
only
the
tendency
to
that
*NL*
diffusive
form
of
gambling
which
has
no
alcoholic
intensity
,
but
is
*NL*
carried
on
with
the
healthiest
chyle-fed
blood
,
keeping
up
a
joyous
*NL*
imaginative
activity
which
fashions
events
according
to
desire
,
and
*NL*
having
no
fears
about
its
own
weather
,
only
sees
the
advantage
there
*NL*
must
be
to
others
in
going
aboard
with
it
.
Hopefulness
has
a
pleasure
*NL*
in
making
a
throw
of
any
kind
,
because
the
prospect
of
success
is
*NL*
certain
;
and
only
a
more
generous
pleasure
in
offering
as
many
as
*NL*
possible
a
share
in
the
stake
.
Fred
liked
play
,
especially
billiards
,
*NL*
as
he
liked
hunting
or
riding
a
steeple-chase
;
and
he
only
liked
it
the
*NL*
better
because
he
wanted
money
and
hoped
to
win
.
But
the
twenty
*NL*
pounds
'
worth
of
seed-corn
had
been
planted
in
vain
in
the
seductive
*NL*
green
plot
--
all
of
it
at
least
which
had
not
been
dispersed
by
the
*NL*
roadside
--
and
Fred
found
himself
close
upon
the
term
of
payment
with
no
*NL*
money
at
command
beyond
the
eighty
pounds
which
he
had
deposited
with
*NL*
his
mother
.
The
broken-winded
horse
which
he
rode
represented
a
*NL*
present
which
had
been
made
to
him
a
long
while
ago
by
his
uncle
*NL*
Featherstone
:
his
father
always
allowed
him
to
keep
a
horse
,
Mr.
*NL*
Vincy
's
own
habits
making
him
regard
this
as
a
reasonable
demand
even
*NL*
for
a
son
who
was
rather
exasperating
.
This
horse
,
then
,
was
Fred
's
*NL*
property
,
and
in
his
anxiety
to
meet
the
imminent
bill
he
determined
to
*NL*
sacrifice
a
possession
without
which
life
would
certainly
be
worth
*NL*
little
.
He
made
the
resolution
with
a
sense
of
heroism
--
heroism
forced
*NL*
on
him
by
the
dread
of
breaking
his
word
to
Mr.
Garth
,
by
his
love
for
*NL*
Mary
and
awe
of
her
opinion
.
He
would
start
for
Houndsley
horse-fair
*NL*
which
was
to
be
held
the
next
morning
,
and
--
simply
sell
his
horse
,
*NL*
bringing
back
the
money
by
coach
?
--
Well
,
the
horse
would
hardly
fetch
*NL*
more
than
thirty
pounds
,
and
there
was
no
knowing
what
might
happen
;
it
*NL*
would
be
folly
to
balk
himself
of
luck
beforehand
.
It
was
a
hundred
to
*NL*
one
that
some
good
chance
would
fall
in
his
way
;
the
longer
he
thought
*NL*
of
it
,
the
less
possible
it
seemed
that
he
should
not
have
a
good
*NL*
chance
,
and
the
less
reasonable
that
he
should
not
equip
himself
with
*NL*
the
powder
and
shot
for
bringing
it
down
.
He
would
ride
to
Houndsley
*NL*
with
Bambridge
and
with
Horrock
``
the
vet
,
''
and
without
asking
them
*NL*
anything
expressly
,
he
should
virtually
get
the
benefit
of
their
*NL*
opinion
.
Before
he
set
out
,
Fred
got
the
eighty
pounds
from
his
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
Most
of
those
who
saw
Fred
riding
out
of
Middlemarch
in
company
with
*NL*
Bambridge
and
Horrock
,
on
his
way
of
course
to
Houndsley
horse-fair
,
*NL*
thought
that
young
Vincy
was
pleasure-seeking
as
usual
;
and
but
for
an
*NL*
unwonted
consciousness
of
grave
matters
on
hand
,
he
himself
would
have
*NL*
had
a
sense
of
dissipation
,
and
of
doing
what
might
be
expected
of
a
*NL*
gay
young
fellow
.
Considering
that
Fred
was
not
at
all
coarse
,
that
he
*NL*
rather
looked
down
on
the
manners
and
speech
of
young
men
who
had
not
*NL*
been
to
the
university
,
and
that
he
had
written
stanzas
as
pastoral
and
*NL*
unvoluptuous
as
his
flute-playing
,
his
attraction
towards
Bambridge
and
*NL*
Horrock
was
an
interesting
fact
which
even
the
love
of
horse-flesh
*NL*
would
not
wholly
account
for
without
that
mysterious
influence
of
*NL*
Naming
which
determinates
so
much
of
mortal
choice
.
Under
any
other
*NL*
name
than
``
pleasure
''
the
society
of
Messieurs
Bambridge
and
Horrock
*NL*
must
certainly
have
been
regarded
as
monotonous
;
and
to
arrive
with
*NL*
them
at
Houndsley
on
a
drizzling
afternoon
,
to
get
down
at
the
Red
Lion
*NL*
in
a
street
shaded
with
coal-dust
,
and
dine
in
a
room
furnished
with
a
*NL*
dirt-enamelled
map
of
the
county
,
a
bad
portrait
of
an
anonymous
horse
*NL*
in
a
stable
,
His
Majesty
George
the
Fourth
with
legs
and
cravat
,
and
*NL*
various
leaden
spittoons
,
might
have
seemed
a
hard
business
,
but
for
*NL*
the
sustaining
power
of
nomenclature
which
determined
that
the
pursuit
*NL*
of
these
things
was
``
gay
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
Mr.
Horrock
there
was
certainly
an
apparent
unfathomableness
which
*NL*
offered
play
to
the
imagination
.
Costume
,
at
a
glance
,
gave
him
a
*NL*
thrilling
association
with
horses
-LRB-
enough
to
specify
the
hat-brim
which
*NL*
took
the
slightest
upward
angle
just
to
escape
the
suspicion
of
bending
*NL*
downwards
-RRB-
,
and
nature
had
given
him
a
face
which
by
dint
of
Mongolian
*NL*
eyes
,
and
a
nose
,
mouth
,
and
chin
seeming
to
follow
his
hat-brim
in
a
*NL*
moderate
inclination
upwards
,
gave
the
effect
of
a
subdued
unchangeable
*NL*
sceptical
smile
,
of
all
expressions
the
most
tyrannous
over
a
*NL*
susceptible
mind
,
and
,
when
accompanied
by
adequate
silence
,
likely
to
*NL*
create
the
reputation
of
an
invincible
understanding
,
an
infinite
fund
*NL*
of
humor
--
too
dry
to
flow
,
and
probably
in
a
state
of
immovable
*NL*
crust
,
--
and
a
critical
judgment
which
,
if
you
could
ever
be
fortunate
*NL*
enough
to
know
it
,
would
be
_
the
_
thing
and
no
other
.
It
is
a
*NL*
physiognomy
seen
in
all
vocations
,
but
perhaps
it
has
never
been
more
*NL*
powerful
over
the
youth
of
England
than
in
a
judge
of
horses
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Horrock
,
at
a
question
from
Fred
about
his
horse
's
fetlock
,
turned
*NL*
sideways
in
his
saddle
,
and
watched
the
horse
's
action
for
the
space
of
*NL*
three
minutes
,
then
turned
forward
,
twitched
his
own
bridle
,
and
*NL*
remained
silent
with
a
profile
neither
more
nor
less
sceptical
than
it
*NL*
had
been
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
part
thus
played
in
dialogue
by
Mr.
Horrock
was
terribly
effective
.
*NL*
A
mixture
of
passions
was
excited
in
Fred
--
a
mad
desire
to
thrash
*NL*
Horrock
's
opinion
into
utterance
,
restrained
by
anxiety
to
retain
the
*NL*
advantage
of
his
friendship
.
There
was
always
the
chance
that
Horrock
*NL*
might
say
something
quite
invaluable
at
the
right
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bambridge
had
more
open
manners
,
and
appeared
to
give
forth
his
*NL*
ideas
without
economy
.
He
was
loud
,
robust
,
and
was
sometimes
spoken
*NL*
of
as
being
``
given
to
indulgence
''
--
chiefly
in
swearing
,
drinking
,
and
*NL*
beating
his
wife
.
Some
people
who
had
lost
by
him
called
him
a
vicious
*NL*
man
;
but
he
regarded
horse-dealing
as
the
finest
of
the
arts
,
and
might
*NL*
have
argued
plausibly
that
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
morality
.
He
was
*NL*
undeniably
a
prosperous
man
,
bore
his
drinking
better
than
others
bore
*NL*
their
moderation
,
and
,
on
the
whole
,
flourished
like
the
green
*NL*
bay-tree
.
But
his
range
of
conversation
was
limited
,
and
like
the
fine
*NL*
old
tune
,
``
Drops
of
brandy
,
''
gave
you
after
a
while
a
sense
of
*NL*
returning
upon
itself
in
a
way
that
might
make
weak
heads
dizzy
.
But
a
*NL*
slight
infusion
of
Mr.
Bambridge
was
felt
to
give
tone
and
character
to
*NL*
several
circles
in
Middlemarch
;
and
he
was
a
distinguished
figure
in
*NL*
the
bar
and
billiard-room
at
the
Green
Dragon
.
He
knew
some
anecdotes
*NL*
about
the
heroes
of
the
turf
,
and
various
clever
tricks
of
Marquesses
*NL*
and
Viscounts
which
seemed
to
prove
that
blood
asserted
its
*NL*
pre-eminence
even
among
black-legs
;
but
the
minute
retentiveness
of
his
*NL*
memory
was
chiefly
shown
about
the
horses
he
had
himself
bought
and
*NL*
sold
;
the
number
of
miles
they
would
trot
you
in
no
time
without
*NL*
turning
a
hair
being
,
after
the
lapse
of
years
,
still
a
subject
of
*NL*
passionate
asseveration
,
in
which
he
would
assist
the
imagination
of
*NL*
his
hearers
by
solemnly
swearing
that
they
never
saw
anything
like
it
.
*NL*
In
short
,
Mr.
Bambridge
was
a
man
of
pleasure
and
a
gay
companion
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fred
was
subtle
,
and
did
not
tell
his
friends
that
he
was
going
to
*NL*
Houndsley
bent
on
selling
his
horse
:
he
wished
to
get
indirectly
at
*NL*
their
genuine
opinion
of
its
value
,
not
being
aware
that
a
genuine
*NL*
opinion
was
the
last
thing
likely
to
be
extracted
from
such
eminent
*NL*
critics
.
It
was
not
Mr.
Bambridge
's
weakness
to
be
a
gratuitous
*NL*
flatterer
.
He
had
never
before
been
so
much
struck
with
the
fact
that
*NL*
this
unfortunate
bay
was
a
roarer
to
a
degree
which
required
the
*NL*
roundest
word
for
perdition
to
give
you
any
idea
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
made
a
bad
hand
at
swapping
when
you
went
to
anybody
but
me
,
*NL*
Vincy
!
Why
,
you
never
threw
your
leg
across
a
finer
horse
than
that
*NL*
chestnut
,
and
you
gave
him
for
this
brute
.
If
you
set
him
cantering
,
*NL*
he
goes
on
like
twenty
sawyers
.
I
never
heard
but
one
worse
roarer
in
*NL*
my
life
,
and
that
was
a
roan
:
it
belonged
to
Pegwell
,
the
corn-factor
;
*NL*
he
used
to
drive
him
in
his
gig
seven
years
ago
,
and
he
wanted
me
to
*NL*
take
him
,
but
I
said
,
`
Thank
you
,
Peg
,
I
do
n't
deal
in
*NL*
wind-instruments
.
'
That
was
what
I
said
.
It
went
the
round
of
the
*NL*
country
,
that
joke
did
.
But
,
what
the
hell
!
the
horse
was
a
penny
*NL*
trumpet
to
that
roarer
of
yours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
you
said
just
now
his
was
worse
than
mine
,
''
said
Fred
,
more
*NL*
irritable
than
usual
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
said
a
lie
,
then
,
''
said
Mr.
Bambridge
,
emphatically
.
``
There
was
n't
*NL*
a
penny
to
choose
between
'em
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fred
spurred
his
horse
,
and
they
trotted
on
a
little
way
.
When
they
*NL*
slackened
again
,
Mr.
Bambridge
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
but
what
the
roan
was
a
better
trotter
than
yours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
quite
satisfied
with
his
paces
,
I
know
,
''
said
Fred
,
who
required
*NL*
all
the
consciousness
of
being
in
gay
company
to
support
him
;
``
I
say
*NL*
his
trot
is
an
uncommonly
clean
one
,
eh
,
Horrock
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Horrock
looked
before
him
with
as
complete
a
neutrality
as
if
he
*NL*
had
been
a
portrait
by
a
great
master
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fred
gave
up
the
fallacious
hope
of
getting
a
genuine
opinion
;
but
on
*NL*
reflection
he
saw
that
Bambridge
's
depreciation
and
Horrock
's
silence
*NL*
were
both
virtually
encouraging
,
and
indicated
that
they
thought
better
*NL*
of
the
horse
than
they
chose
to
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
very
evening
,
indeed
,
before
the
fair
had
set
in
,
Fred
thought
he
*NL*
saw
a
favorable
opening
for
disposing
advantageously
of
his
horse
,
but
*NL*
an
opening
which
made
him
congratulate
himself
on
his
foresight
in
*NL*
bringing
with
him
his
eighty
pounds
.
A
young
farmer
,
acquainted
with
*NL*
Mr.
Bambridge
,
came
into
the
Red
Lion
,
and
entered
into
conversation
*NL*
about
parting
with
a
hunter
,
which
he
introduced
at
once
as
Diamond
,
*NL*
implying
that
it
was
a
public
character
.
For
himself
he
only
wanted
a
*NL*
useful
hack
,
which
would
draw
upon
occasion
;
being
about
to
marry
and
*NL*
to
give
up
hunting
.
The
hunter
was
in
a
friend
's
stable
at
some
little
*NL*
distance
;
there
was
still
time
for
gentlemen
to
see
it
before
dark
.
*NL*
The
friend
's
stable
had
to
be
reached
through
a
back
street
where
you
*NL*
might
as
easily
have
been
poisoned
without
expense
of
drugs
as
in
any
*NL*
grim
street
of
that
unsanitary
period
.
Fred
was
not
fortified
against
*NL*
disgust
by
brandy
,
as
his
companions
were
,
but
the
hope
of
having
at
*NL*
last
seen
the
horse
that
would
enable
him
to
make
money
was
*NL*
exhilarating
enough
to
lead
him
over
the
same
ground
again
the
first
*NL*
thing
in
the
morning
.
He
felt
sure
that
if
he
did
not
come
to
a
*NL*
bargain
with
the
farmer
,
Bambridge
would
;
for
the
stress
of
*NL*
circumstances
,
Fred
felt
,
was
sharpening
his
acuteness
and
endowing
him
*NL*
with
all
the
constructive
power
of
suspicion
.
Bambridge
had
run
down
*NL*
Diamond
in
a
way
that
he
never
would
have
done
-LRB-
the
horse
being
a
*NL*
friend
's
-RRB-
if
he
had
not
thought
of
buying
it
;
every
one
who
looked
at
*NL*
the
animal
--
even
Horrock
--
was
evidently
impressed
with
its
merit
.
To
*NL*
get
all
the
advantage
of
being
with
men
of
this
sort
,
you
must
know
how
*NL*
to
draw
your
inferences
,
and
not
be
a
spoon
who
takes
things
literally
.
*NL*
The
color
of
the
horse
was
a
dappled
gray
,
and
Fred
happened
to
know
*NL*
that
Lord
Medlicote
's
man
was
on
the
look-out
for
just
such
a
horse
.
*NL*
After
all
his
running
down
,
Bambridge
let
it
out
in
the
course
of
the
*NL*
evening
,
when
the
farmer
was
absent
,
that
he
had
seen
worse
horses
go
*NL*
for
eighty
pounds
.
Of
course
he
contradicted
himself
twenty
times
*NL*
over
,
but
when
you
know
what
is
likely
to
be
true
you
can
test
a
man
's
*NL*
admissions
.
And
Fred
could
not
but
reckon
his
own
judgment
of
a
horse
*NL*
as
worth
something
.
The
farmer
had
paused
over
Fred
's
respectable
*NL*
though
broken-winded
steed
long
enough
to
show
that
he
thought
it
worth
*NL*
consideration
,
and
it
seemed
probable
that
he
would
take
it
,
with
*NL*
five-and-twenty
pounds
in
addition
,
as
the
equivalent
of
Diamond
.
In
*NL*
that
case
Fred
,
when
he
had
parted
with
his
new
horse
for
at
least
*NL*
eighty
pounds
,
would
be
fifty-five
pounds
in
pocket
by
the
transaction
,
*NL*
and
would
have
a
hundred
and
thirty-five
pounds
towards
meeting
the
*NL*
bill
;
so
that
the
deficit
temporarily
thrown
on
Mr.
Garth
would
at
the
*NL*
utmost
be
twenty-five
pounds
.
By
the
time
he
was
hurrying
on
his
*NL*
clothes
in
the
morning
,
he
saw
so
clearly
the
importance
of
not
losing
*NL*
this
rare
chance
,
that
if
Bambridge
and
Horrock
had
both
dissuaded
him
,
*NL*
he
would
not
have
been
deluded
into
a
direct
interpretation
of
their
*NL*
purpose
:
he
would
have
been
aware
that
those
deep
hands
held
something
*NL*
else
than
a
young
fellow
's
interest
.
With
regard
to
horses
,
distrust
*NL*
was
your
only
clew
.
But
scepticism
,
as
we
know
,
can
never
be
*NL*
thoroughly
applied
,
else
life
would
come
to
a
standstill
:
something
we
*NL*
must
believe
in
and
do
,
and
whatever
that
something
may
be
called
,
it
*NL*
is
virtually
our
own
judgment
,
even
when
it
seems
like
the
most
slavish
*NL*
reliance
on
another
.
Fred
believed
in
the
excellence
of
his
bargain
,
*NL*
and
even
before
the
fair
had
well
set
in
,
had
got
possession
of
the
*NL*
dappled
gray
,
at
the
price
of
his
old
horse
and
thirty
pounds
in
*NL*
addition
--
only
five
pounds
more
than
he
had
expected
to
give
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
felt
a
little
worried
and
wearied
,
perhaps
with
mental
debate
,
*NL*
and
without
waiting
for
the
further
gayeties
of
the
horse-fair
,
he
set
*NL*
out
alone
on
his
fourteen
miles
'
journey
,
meaning
to
take
it
very
*NL*
quietly
and
keep
his
horse
fresh
.

SHAKESPEARE

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
am
sorry
to
say
that
only
the
third
day
after
the
propitious
events
*NL*
at
Houndsley
Fred
Vincy
had
fallen
into
worse
spirits
than
he
had
known
*NL*
in
his
life
before
.
Not
that
he
had
been
disappointed
as
to
the
*NL*
possible
market
for
his
horse
,
but
that
before
the
bargain
could
be
*NL*
concluded
with
Lord
Medlicote
's
man
,
this
Diamond
,
in
which
hope
to
the
*NL*
amount
of
eighty
pounds
had
been
invested
,
had
without
the
slightest
*NL*
warning
exhibited
in
the
stable
a
most
vicious
energy
in
kicking
,
had
*NL*
just
missed
killing
the
groom
,
and
had
ended
in
laming
himself
severely
*NL*
by
catching
his
leg
in
a
rope
that
overhung
the
stable-board
.
There
was
*NL*
no
more
redress
for
this
than
for
the
discovery
of
bad
temper
after
*NL*
marriage
--
which
of
course
old
companions
were
aware
of
before
the
*NL*
ceremony
.
For
some
reason
or
other
,
Fred
had
none
of
his
usual
*NL*
elasticity
under
this
stroke
of
ill-fortune
:
he
was
simply
aware
that
*NL*
he
had
only
fifty
pounds
,
that
there
was
no
chance
of
his
getting
any
*NL*
more
at
present
,
and
that
the
bill
for
a
hundred
and
sixty
would
be
*NL*
presented
in
five
days
.
Even
if
he
had
applied
to
his
father
on
the
*NL*
plea
that
Mr.
Garth
should
be
saved
from
loss
,
Fred
felt
smartingly
*NL*
that
his
father
would
angrily
refuse
to
rescue
Mr.
Garth
from
the
*NL*
consequence
of
what
he
would
call
encouraging
extravagance
and
deceit
.
*NL*
He
was
so
utterly
downcast
that
he
could
frame
no
other
project
than
to
*NL*
go
straight
to
Mr.
Garth
and
tell
him
the
sad
truth
,
carrying
with
him
*NL*
the
fifty
pounds
,
and
getting
that
sum
at
least
safely
out
of
his
own
*NL*
hands
.
His
father
,
being
at
the
warehouse
,
did
not
yet
know
of
the
*NL*
accident
:
when
he
did
,
he
would
storm
about
the
vicious
brute
being
*NL*
brought
into
his
stable
;
and
before
meeting
that
lesser
annoyance
Fred
*NL*
wanted
to
get
away
with
all
his
courage
to
face
the
greater
.
He
took
*NL*
his
father
's
nag
,
for
he
had
made
up
his
mind
that
when
he
had
told
Mr.
*NL*
Garth
,
he
would
ride
to
Stone
Court
and
confess
all
to
Mary
.
In
fact
,
*NL*
it
is
probable
that
but
for
Mary
's
existence
and
Fred
's
love
for
her
,
*NL*
his
conscience
would
have
been
much
less
active
both
in
previously
*NL*
urging
the
debt
on
his
thought
and
impelling
him
not
to
spare
himself
*NL*
after
his
usual
fashion
by
deferring
an
unpleasant
task
,
but
to
act
as
*NL*
directly
and
simply
as
he
could
.
Even
much
stronger
mortals
than
Fred
*NL*
Vincy
hold
half
their
rectitude
in
the
mind
of
the
being
they
love
*NL*
best
.
``
The
theatre
of
all
my
actions
is
fallen
,
''
said
an
antique
*NL*
personage
when
his
chief
friend
was
dead
;
and
they
are
fortunate
who
*NL*
get
a
theatre
where
the
audience
demands
their
best
.
Certainly
it
*NL*
would
have
made
a
considerable
difference
to
Fred
at
that
time
if
Mary
*NL*
Garth
had
had
no
decided
notions
as
to
what
was
admirable
in
character
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Garth
was
not
at
the
office
,
and
Fred
rode
on
to
his
house
,
which
*NL*
was
a
little
way
outside
the
town
--
a
homely
place
with
an
orchard
in
*NL*
front
of
it
,
a
rambling
,
old-fashioned
,
half-timbered
building
,
which
*NL*
before
the
town
had
spread
had
been
a
farm-house
,
but
was
now
*NL*
surrounded
with
the
private
gardens
of
the
townsmen
.
We
get
the
fonder
*NL*
of
our
houses
if
they
have
a
physiognomy
of
their
own
,
as
our
friends
*NL*
have
.
The
Garth
family
,
which
was
rather
a
large
one
,
for
Mary
had
*NL*
four
brothers
and
one
sister
,
were
very
fond
of
their
old
house
,
from
*NL*
which
all
the
best
furniture
had
long
been
sold
.
Fred
liked
it
too
,
*NL*
knowing
it
by
heart
even
to
the
attic
which
smelt
deliciously
of
apples
*NL*
and
quinces
,
and
until
to-day
he
had
never
come
to
it
without
pleasant
*NL*
expectations
;
but
his
heart
beat
uneasily
now
with
the
sense
that
he
*NL*
should
probably
have
to
make
his
confession
before
Mrs.
Garth
,
of
whom
*NL*
he
was
rather
more
in
awe
than
of
her
husband
.
Not
that
she
was
*NL*
inclined
to
sarcasm
and
to
impulsive
sallies
,
as
Mary
was
.
In
her
*NL*
present
matronly
age
at
least
,
Mrs.
Garth
never
committed
herself
by
*NL*
over-hasty
speech
;
having
,
as
she
said
,
borne
the
yoke
in
her
youth
,
*NL*
and
learned
self-control
.
She
had
that
rare
sense
which
discerns
what
*NL*
is
unalterable
,
and
submits
to
it
without
murmuring
.
Adoring
her
*NL*
husband
's
virtues
,
she
had
very
early
made
up
her
mind
to
his
*NL*
incapacity
of
minding
his
own
interests
,
and
had
met
the
consequences
*NL*
cheerfully
.
She
had
been
magnanimous
enough
to
renounce
all
pride
in
*NL*
teapots
or
children
's
frilling
,
and
had
never
poured
any
pathetic
*NL*
confidences
into
the
ears
of
her
feminine
neighbors
concerning
Mr.
*NL*
Garth
's
want
of
prudence
and
the
sums
he
might
have
had
if
he
had
been
*NL*
like
other
men
.
Hence
these
fair
neighbors
thought
her
either
proud
or
*NL*
eccentric
,
and
sometimes
spoke
of
her
to
their
husbands
as
``
your
fine
*NL*
Mrs.
Garth
.
''
She
was
not
without
her
criticism
of
them
in
return
,
being
*NL*
more
accurately
instructed
than
most
matrons
in
Middlemarch
,
and
--
where
*NL*
is
the
blameless
woman
?
--
apt
to
be
a
little
severe
towards
her
own
sex
,
*NL*
which
in
her
opinion
was
framed
to
be
entirely
subordinate
.
On
the
*NL*
other
hand
,
she
was
disproportionately
indulgent
towards
the
failings
*NL*
of
men
,
and
was
often
heard
to
say
that
these
were
natural
.
Also
,
it
*NL*
must
be
admitted
that
Mrs.
Garth
was
a
trifle
too
emphatic
in
her
*NL*
resistance
to
what
she
held
to
be
follies
:
the
passage
from
governess
*NL*
into
housewife
had
wrought
itself
a
little
too
strongly
into
her
*NL*
consciousness
,
and
she
rarely
forgot
that
while
her
grammar
and
accent
*NL*
were
above
the
town
standard
,
she
wore
a
plain
cap
,
cooked
the
family
*NL*
dinner
,
and
darned
all
the
stockings
.
She
had
sometimes
taken
pupils
*NL*
in
a
peripatetic
fashion
,
making
them
follow
her
about
in
the
kitchen
*NL*
with
their
book
or
slate
.
She
thought
it
good
for
them
to
see
that
she
*NL*
could
make
an
excellent
lather
while
she
corrected
their
blunders
*NL*
``
without
looking
,
''
--
that
a
woman
with
her
sleeves
tucked
up
above
her
*NL*
elbows
might
know
all
about
the
Subjunctive
Mood
or
the
Torrid
*NL*
Zone
--
that
,
in
short
,
she
might
possess
``
education
''
and
other
good
*NL*
things
ending
in
``
tion
,
''
and
worthy
to
be
pronounced
emphatically
,
*NL*
without
being
a
useless
doll
.
When
she
made
remarks
to
this
edifying
*NL*
effect
,
she
had
a
firm
little
frown
on
her
brow
,
which
yet
did
not
*NL*
hinder
her
face
from
looking
benevolent
,
and
her
words
which
came
forth
*NL*
like
a
procession
were
uttered
in
a
fervid
agreeable
contralto
.
*NL*
Certainly
,
the
exemplary
Mrs.
Garth
had
her
droll
aspects
,
but
her
*NL*
character
sustained
her
oddities
,
as
a
very
fine
wine
sustains
a
flavor
*NL*
of
skin
.
*NL*
*NL*
Towards
Fred
Vincy
she
had
a
motherly
feeling
,
and
had
always
been
*NL*
disposed
to
excuse
his
errors
,
though
she
would
probably
not
have
*NL*
excused
Mary
for
engaging
herself
to
him
,
her
daughter
being
included
*NL*
in
that
more
rigorous
judgment
which
she
applied
to
her
own
sex
.
But
*NL*
this
very
fact
of
her
exceptional
indulgence
towards
him
made
it
the
*NL*
harder
to
Fred
that
he
must
now
inevitably
sink
in
her
opinion
.
And
*NL*
the
circumstances
of
his
visit
turned
out
to
be
still
more
unpleasant
*NL*
than
he
had
expected
;
for
Caleb
Garth
had
gone
out
early
to
look
at
*NL*
some
repairs
not
far
off
.
Mrs.
Garth
at
certain
hours
was
always
in
*NL*
the
kitchen
,
and
this
morning
she
was
carrying
on
several
occupations
*NL*
at
once
there
--
making
her
pies
at
the
well-scoured
deal
table
on
one
*NL*
side
of
that
airy
room
,
observing
Sally
's
movements
at
the
oven
and
*NL*
dough-tub
through
an
open
door
,
and
giving
lessons
to
her
youngest
boy
*NL*
and
girl
,
who
were
standing
opposite
to
her
at
the
table
with
their
*NL*
books
and
slates
before
them
.
A
tub
and
a
clothes-horse
at
the
other
*NL*
end
of
the
kitchen
indicated
an
intermittent
wash
of
small
things
also
*NL*
going
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Garth
,
with
her
sleeves
turned
above
her
elbows
,
deftly
handling
*NL*
her
pastry
--
applying
her
rolling-pin
and
giving
ornamental
pinches
,
*NL*
while
she
expounded
with
grammatical
fervor
what
were
the
right
views
*NL*
about
the
concord
of
verbs
and
pronouns
with
``
nouns
of
multitude
or
*NL*
signifying
many
,
''
was
a
sight
agreeably
amusing
.
She
was
of
the
same
*NL*
curly-haired
,
square-faced
type
as
Mary
,
but
handsomer
,
with
more
*NL*
delicacy
of
feature
,
a
pale
skin
,
a
solid
matronly
figure
,
and
a
*NL*
remarkable
firmness
of
glance
.
In
her
snowy-frilled
cap
she
reminded
*NL*
one
of
that
delightful
Frenchwoman
whom
we
have
all
seen
marketing
,
*NL*
basket
on
arm
.
Looking
at
the
mother
,
you
might
hope
that
the
daughter
*NL*
would
become
like
her
,
which
is
a
prospective
advantage
equal
to
a
*NL*
dowry
--
the
mother
too
often
standing
behind
the
daughter
like
a
*NL*
malignant
prophecy
--
``
Such
as
I
am
,
she
will
shortly
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
let
us
go
through
that
once
more
,
''
said
Mrs.
Garth
,
pinching
an
*NL*
apple-puff
which
seemed
to
distract
Ben
,
an
energetic
young
male
with
a
*NL*
heavy
brow
,
from
due
attention
to
the
lesson
.
''
`
Not
without
regard
to
*NL*
the
import
of
the
word
as
conveying
unity

plurality
of
idea

me
again
what
that
means

*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
Mrs.
Garth
,
like
more
celebrated
educators
,
had
her
favorite
ancient
*NL*
paths
,
and
in
a
general
wreck
of
society
would
have
tried
to
hold
her
*NL*
``
Lindley
Murray
''
above
the
waves
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

it
means

you
must
think
what
you

said
Ben
,
rather
*NL*
peevishly
.
``
I
hate

the

*NL*

*NL*

Ben

stoutly
;

said
*NL*
Letty
,
with
an
air
of
superiority

You

``
No

said
Mrs.

was
an
agreeable

was
concerned

*NL*
``

said
Mrs.

,
*NL*
accustomed
to
these
obstructive
arguments
from
her
male
offspring
.
*NL*
Having
finished
her
pies
,
she
moved
towards
the
clothes-horse
,
and
*NL*
said
,
``
Come

from

-LRB-
Mrs.
*NL*
Garth
delivered
this
awful
sentence
with
much
majesty
of
enunciation
,
*NL*
and
Letty
felt
that
between
repressed
volubility
and
general
disesteem
,
*NL*
that
of
the
Romans
inclusive

life
was
already
a
painful
affair

*NL*
``

Letty

with
injured
looks

not
without
a
wish
*NL*
to
make
her
mother
repent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well

said
Ben
,
contemptuously
.
``
But
that

a

*NL*
*NL*
``
Come

carefully
serious

Run

*NL*
*NL*
The
knock
was
Fred

;
and
when
Letty
said
that
her
father
was
not
in
*NL*
yet
,
but
that
her
mother
was
in
the
kitchen
,
Fred
had
no
alternative
.
*NL*
He
could
not
depart
from
his
usual
practice
of
going
to
see
Mrs.
Garth
*NL*
in
the
kitchen
if
she
happened
to
be
at
work
there
.
He
put
his
arm
*NL*
round
Letty
's
neck
silently
,
and
led
her
into
the
kitchen
without
his
*NL*
usual
jokes
and
caresses
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Garth
was
surprised
to
see
Fred
at
this
hour
,
but
surprise
was
not
*NL*
a
feeling
that
she
was
given
to
express
,
and
she
only
said
,
quietly
*NL*
continuing
her
work
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You

Fred

so
early

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want

said
Fred
,
not
yet
ready
to
say
*NL*
more
--
``
and
to
you
also

''
he
added
,
after
a
little
pause
,
for
he
had
no
*NL*
doubt
that
Mrs.
Garth
knew
everything
about
the
bill
,
and
he
must
in
the
*NL*
end
speak
of
it
before
her
,
if
not
to
her
solely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Caleb

be
in

Mrs.

who

imagined
some
trouble
between
Fred

his
father

``

*NL*

who

taken

whip
out
of

was
trying
its
efficiency
on
the

cat

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

rendering
up
the

with
an
air
of
not
being
obliged
to
do
it

*NL*
*NL*
``

with
an
unpleasant
twinge

Enough

Mrs.

seeing
that
Fred

teased
...
*NL*
*NL*
``

Ben

said
Fred
,
when
*NL*
the
children
were
gone
and
it
was
needful
to
say
something
that
would
*NL*
pass
the
time
.
He
was
not
yet
sure
whether
he
should
wait
for
Mr.

Garth
,
or
use
any
good
opportunity
in
conversation
to
confess
to
Mrs.
*NL*
Garth
herself

give
her
the
money
and
ride
away

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
Mrs.

smiling
.
``
I
am

a
low

ebb

But
I
have
saved
my

purse

*NL*
premium

I
have
ninety-two
pounds

He

Mr.
Hanmer

he
*NL*
is
just
at
the
right
age

''
*NL*
*NL*
This
did
not
lead
well
towards
the
news
that
Mr.
Garth
was
on
the
brink
*NL*
of
losing
ninety-two
pounds
and
more
.
Fred
was
silent
.
``
Young
*NL*
gentlemen
who
go
to
college
are
rather
more
costly
than
that

Mrs.

Garth
innocently
continued
,
pulling
out
the
edging
on
a
cap-border

*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
When
they
entered
the
parlor
Caleb
had
thrown
down
his

and
was
*NL*
seated
at
his
desk

*NL*
*NL*
``
What

he
said
,
in
a
tone
of
mild
surprise
,
holding
his
*NL*
pen
still
undipped
;
``
you
are
here
betimes

''
But
missing
the
usual
*NL*
expression
of
cheerful
greeting
in
Fred
's
face
,
he
immediately
added
,
*NL*
``
Is
there
anything
up

anything
the

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

hundred

sixty

*NL*
*NL*
While
Fred
was
speaking
,
he
had
taken
out
the
notes
and
laid
them
on
*NL*
the
desk
before
Mr.
Garth
.
He
had
burst
forth
at
once
with
the
plain
*NL*
fact
,
feeling
boyishly
miserable
and
without
verbal
resources
.
Mrs.
*NL*
Garth
was
mutely
astonished
,
and
looked
at
her
husband
for
an
*NL*
explanation
.
Caleb
blushed
,
and
after
a
little
pause
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

made

*NL*
*NL*
There
was
an
evident
change
in
Mrs.
Garth
's
face
,
but
it
was
like
a
*NL*
change
below
the
surface
of
water
which
remains
smooth
.
She
fixed
her
*NL*
eyes
on
Fred
,
saying

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

said
Fred
,
biting
his
lip
,
and
speaking
with
more
difficulty
;
*NL*
``
but
I
know
it
will
be

no

*NL*
``
It
has
come
at
an

said
Caleb
,
in
his
hesitating

way

looking
down
at
the
notes
and
nervously
fingering
the
paper
,
*NL*
``
Christmas
upon
us

I
'm
rather
hard
up
just
now

You
see
,
I
have
to
*NL*
cut
out
everything
like
a
tailor
with
short
measure
.
What
can
we
do
,
*NL*
Susan
?
I
shall
want
every
farthing
we
have
in
the
bank

It
's
a
*NL*
hundred
and
ten
pounds

deuce

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
give
you
the
ninety-two
pounds

I
have
put
by
for
Alfred

said
Mrs.
Garth
,
gravely
and
decisively
,
though
a
nice
ear
*NL*
might
have
discerned
a
slight
tremor
in
some
of
the
words
.
``
And
I
have
*NL*
no
doubt
that
Mary
has
twenty
pounds
saved
from
her
salary
by
this
*NL*
time

She
will
advance
it

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Garth
had
not
again
looked
at
Fred
,
and
was
not
in
the
least
*NL*
calculating
what
words
she
should
use
to
cut
him
the
most
effectively
.
*NL*
Like
the
eccentric
woman
she
was
,
she
was
at
present
absorbed
in
*NL*
considering
what
was
to
be
done
,
and
did
not
fancy
that
the
end
could
*NL*
be
better
achieved
by
bitter
remarks
or
explosions
.
But
she
had
made
*NL*
Fred
feel
for
the
first
time
something
like
the
tooth
of
remorse
.
*NL*
Curiously
enough
,
his
pain
in
the
affair
beforehand
had
consisted
*NL*
almost
entirely
in
the
sense
that
he
must
seem
dishonorable
,
and
sink
*NL*
in
the
opinion
of
the
Garths
:
he
had
not
occupied
himself
with
the
*NL*
inconvenience
and
possible
injury
that
his
breach
might
occasion
them
,
*NL*
for
this
exercise
of
the
imagination
on
other
people
's
needs
is
not
*NL*
common
with
hopeful
young
gentlemen
.
Indeed
we
are
most
of
us
brought
*NL*
up
in
the
notion
that
the
highest
motive
for
not
doing
a
wrong
is
*NL*
something
irrespective
of
the
beings
who
would
suffer
the
wrong
.
But
*NL*
at
this
moment
he
suddenly
saw
himself
as
a
pitiful
rascal
who
was
*NL*
robbing
two
women
of
their
savings
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
certainly
pay
it
all
,
Mrs.
Garth
--
ultimately
,
''
he
stammered
*NL*
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
ultimately
,
''
said
Mrs.
Garth
,
who
having
a
special
dislike
to
*NL*
fine
words
on
ugly
occasions
,
could
not
now
repress
an
epigram
.
``
But
*NL*
boys
can
not
well
be
apprenticed
ultimately
:
they
should
be
apprenticed
*NL*
at
fifteen
.
''
She
had
never
been
so
little
inclined
to
make
excuses
for
*NL*
Fred
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
the
most
in
the
wrong
,
Susan
,
''
said
Caleb
.
``
Fred
made
sure
of
*NL*
finding
the
money

But
I
'd
no
business
to
be
fingering
bills

I
*NL*
suppose
you
have
looked
all
round
and
tried
all
honest
means
?
''
he
*NL*
added
,
fixing
his
merciful
gray
eyes
on
Fred
.
Caleb
was
too
delicate
,
*NL*
to
specify
Mr.
Featherstone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
have
tried
everything
--
I
really
have
.
I
should
have
had
a
*NL*
hundred
and
thirty
pounds
ready
but
for
a
misfortune
with
a
horse
which
*NL*
I
was
about
to
sell
.
My
uncle
had
given
me
eighty
pounds
,
and
I
paid
*NL*
away
thirty
with
my
old
horse
in
order
to
get
another
which
I
was
going
*NL*
to
sell
for
eighty
or
more
--
I
meant
to
go
without
a
horse
--
but
now
it
*NL*
has
turned
out
vicious
and
lamed
itself
.
I
wish
I
and
the
horses
too
*NL*
had
been
at
the
devil
,
before
I
had
brought
this
on
you
.
There
's
no
*NL*
one
else
I
care
so
much
for
:
you
and
Mrs.
Garth
have
always
been
so
*NL*
kind
to
me
.
However
,
it
's
no
use
saying
that
.
You
will
always
think
*NL*
me
a
rascal
now

''
*NL*
*NL*
Fred
turned
round
and
hurried
out
of
the
room
,
conscious
that
he
was
*NL*
getting
rather
womanish
,
and
feeling
confusedly
that
his
being
sorry
*NL*
was
not
of
much
use
to
the
Garths
.
They
could
see
him
mount
,
and
*NL*
quickly
pass
through
the
gate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
disappointed
in
Fred
Vincy
,
''
said
Mrs.
Garth
.
``
I
would
not
have
*NL*
believed
beforehand
that
he
would
have
drawn
you
into
his
debts

I
*NL*
knew
he
was
extravagant
,
but
I
did
not
think
that
he
would
be
so
mean
*NL*
as
to
hang
his
risks
on
his
oldest
friend
,
who
could
the
least
afford
*NL*
to
lose
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
a
fool

Susan

*NL*
*NL*
``
That

said
the
wife
,
nodding
and
smiling
.
``
But
I
should
not
*NL*
have
gone
to
publish
it
in
the
market-place

Why
should
you
keep
such

things
from
me
?
It
is
just
so
with
your
buttons
:
you
let
them
burst
*NL*
off
without
telling
me
,
and
go
out
with
your
wristband
hanging
.
If
I
*NL*
had
only
known
I
might
have
been
ready
with
some
better
plan
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
sadly
cut
up
,
I
know
,
Susan
,
''
said
Caleb
,
looking
feelingly
at
*NL*
her
.
``
I
ca
n't
abide
your
losing
the
money
you
've
scraped
together
for
*NL*
Alfred
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
very
well
that
I
_
had
_
scraped
it
together
;
and
it
is
you
who
*NL*
will
have
to
suffer
,
for
you
must
teach
the
boy
yourself
.
You
must
*NL*
give
up
your
bad
habits
.
Some
men
take
to
drinking
,
and
you
have
taken
*NL*
to
working
without
pay
.
You
must
indulge
yourself
a
little
less
in
*NL*
that
.
And
you
must
ride
over
to
Mary
,
and
ask
the
child
what
money
she
*NL*
has
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Caleb
had
pushed
his
chair
back
,
and
was
leaning
forward
,
shaking
his
*NL*
head
slowly
,
and
fitting
his
finger-tips
together
with
much
nicety
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
Mary
!
''
he
said
.
``
Susan
,
''
he
went
on
in
a
lowered
tone
,
``
I
'm
*NL*
afraid
she
may
be
fond
of
Fred
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
!
She
always
laughs
at
him
;
and
he
is
not
likely
to
think
of
her
*NL*
in
any
other
than
a
brotherly
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Caleb
made
no
rejoinder
,
but
presently
lowered
his
spectacles
,
drew
up
*NL*
his
chair
to
the
desk
,
and
said
,
``
Deuce
take
the
bill
--
I
wish
it
was
*NL*
at
Hanover
!
These
things
are
a
sad
interruption
to
business
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
part
of
this
speech
comprised
his
whole
store
of
maledictory
*NL*
expression
,
and
was
uttered
with
a
slight
snarl
easy
to
imagine
.
But
*NL*
it
would
be
difficult
to
convey
to
those
who
never
heard
him
utter
the
*NL*
word
``
business
,
''
the
peculiar
tone
of
fervid
veneration
,
of
religious
*NL*
regard
,
in
which
he
wrapped
it
,
as
a
consecrated
symbol
is
wrapped
in
*NL*
its
gold-fringed
linen
.
*NL*
*NL*
Caleb
Garth
often
shook
his
head
in
meditation
on
the
value
,
the
*NL*
indispensable
might
of
that
myriad-headed
,
myriad-handed
labor
by
which
*NL*
the
social
body
is
fed
,
clothed
,
and
housed
.
It
had
laid
hold
of
his
*NL*
imagination
in
boyhood
.
The
echoes
of
the
great
hammer
where
roof
or
*NL*
keel
were
a-making
,
the
signal-shouts
of
the
workmen
,
the
roar
of
the
*NL*
furnace
,
the
thunder
and
plash
of
the
engine
,
were
a
sublime
music
to
*NL*
him
;
the
felling
and
lading
of
timber
,
and
the
huge
trunk
vibrating
*NL*
star-like
in
the
distance
along
the
highway
,
the
crane
at
work
on
the
*NL*
wharf
,
the
piled-up
produce
in
warehouses
,
the
precision
and
variety
of
*NL*
muscular
effort
wherever
exact
work
had
to
be
turned
out
,
--
all
these
*NL*
sights
of
his
youth
had
acted
on
him
as
poetry
without
the
aid
of
the
*NL*
poets
,
had
made
a
philosophy
for
him
without
the
aid
of
philosophers
,
*NL*
a
religion
without
the
aid
of
theology
.
His
early
ambition
had
been
to
*NL*
have
as
effective
a
share
as
possible
in
this
sublime
labor
,
which
was
*NL*
peculiarly
dignified
by
him
with
the
name
of
``
business
;
''
and
though
he
*NL*
had
only
been
a
short
time
under
a
surveyor
,
and
had
been
chiefly
his
*NL*
own
teacher
,
he
knew
more
of
land
,
building
,
and
mining
than
most
of
*NL*
the
special
men
in
the
county
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
classification
of
human
employments
was
rather
crude
,
and
,
like
the
*NL*
categories
of
more
celebrated
men
,
would
not
be
acceptable
in
these
*NL*
advanced
times
.
He
divided
them
into
``
business
,
politics
,
preaching
,
*NL*
learning
,
and
amusement
.
''
He
had
nothing
to
say
against
the
last
four
;
*NL*
but
he
regarded
them
as
a
reverential
pagan
regarded
other
gods
than
*NL*
his
own
.
In
the
same
way
,
he
thought
very
well
of
all
ranks
,
but
he
*NL*
would
not
himself
have
liked
to
be
of
any
rank
in
which
he
had
not
such
*NL*
close
contact
with
``
business
''
as
to
get
often
honorably
decorated
with
*NL*
marks
of
dust
and
mortar
,
the
damp
of
the
engine
,
or
the
sweet
soil
of
*NL*
the
woods
and
fields
.
Though
he
had
never
regarded
himself
as
other
*NL*
than
an
orthodox
Christian
,
and
would
argue
on
prevenient
grace
if
the
*NL*
subject
were
proposed
to
him
,
I
think
his
virtual
divinities
were
good
*NL*
practical
schemes
,
accurate
work
,
and
the
faithful
completion
of
*NL*
undertakings
:
his
prince
of
darkness
was
a
slack
workman
.
But
there
*NL*
was
no
spirit
of
denial
in
Caleb
,
and
the
world
seemed
so
wondrous
to
*NL*
him
that
he
was
ready
to
accept
any
number
of
systems
,
like
any
number
*NL*
of
firmaments
,
if
they
did
not
obviously
interfere
with
the
best
*NL*
land-drainage
,
solid
building
,
correct
measuring
,
and
judicious
boring
*NL*
-LRB-
for
coal
-RRB-
.
In
fact
,
he
had
a
reverential
soul
with
a
strong
practical
*NL*
intelligence
.
But
he
could
not
manage
finance
:
he
knew
values
well
,
*NL*
but
he
had
no
keenness
of
imagination
for
monetary
results
in
the
shape
*NL*
of
profit
and
loss
:
and
having
ascertained
this
to
his
cost
,
he
*NL*
determined
to
give
up
all
forms
of
his
beloved
``
business
''
which
*NL*
required
that
talent
.
He
gave
himself
up
entirely
to
the
many
kinds
of
*NL*
work
which
he
could
do
without
handling
capital
,
and
was
one
of
those
*NL*
precious
men
within
his
own
district
whom
everybody
would
choose
to
*NL*
work
for
them
,
because
he
did
his
work
well
,
charged
very
little
,
and
*NL*
often
declined
to
charge
at
all
.
It
is
no
wonder
,
then
,
that
the
*NL*
Garths
were
poor
,
and
``
lived
in
a
small
way
.
''
However
,
they
did
not
*NL*
mind
it

*NL*
Fred
Vincy
wanted
to
arrive
at
Stone
Court
when
Mary
could
not
expect
*NL*
him
,
and
when
his
uncle
was
not
down-stairs
in
that
case
she
might
be
*NL*
sitting
alone
in
the
wainscoted
parlor
.
He
left
his
horse
in
the
yard
*NL*
to
avoid
making
a
noise
on
the
gravel
in
front
,
and
entered
the
parlor
*NL*
without
other
notice
than
the
noise
of
the
door-handle
.
Mary
was
in
her
*NL*
usual
corner
,
laughing
over
Mrs.
Piozzi
's
recollections
of
Johnson
,
and
*NL*
looked
up
with
the
fun
still
in
her
face
.
It
gradually
faded
as
she
*NL*
saw
Fred
approach
her
without
speaking
,
and
stand
before
her
with
his
*NL*
elbow
on
the
mantel-piece
,
looking
ill
.
She
too
was
silent
,
only
*NL*
raising
her
eyes
to
him
inquiringly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mary

he
began
,
``
I

``

one
of

trying

smile
,
but
feeling
alarmed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

fifty
pounds

And
I
ca
n't
ask
my
father
for
the
money
:
he
*NL*
would
not
give
me
a
farthing
.
And
my
uncle
gave
me
a
hundred
a
little
*NL*
while
ago
.
So
what
can
I
do
?
And
now
your
father
has
no
ready
money
*NL*
to
spare
,
and
your
mother
will
have
to
pay
away
her
ninety-two
pounds
*NL*
that
she
has
saved
,
and
she
says
your
savings
must
go
too

You

what

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
poor
mother

poor
father

said
Mary
,
her
eyes
filling
with
tears
,
*NL*
and
a
little
sob
rising
which
she
tried
to
repress
.
She
looked
*NL*
straight
before
her
and
took
no
notice
of
Fred
,
all
the
consequences
at
*NL*
home
becoming
present
to
her
.
He
too
remained
silent
for
some
moments
,
*NL*
feeling
more
miserable
than
ever
.
``
I
would
n't
have
hurt
you
for
the
*NL*
world
,
Mary
,
''
he
said
at
last
.
``
You
can
never
forgive
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
does
it
matter
whether
I
forgive
you
?
''
said
Mary
,
passionately
.
*NL*
``
Would
that
make
it
any
better
for
my
mother

lose
the
money

been
earning

four
years
,
that
she
might
send
Alfred

Should
you
think
all
that
pleasant
enough
if
I
forgave
*NL*
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
what
you

I
deserve
it
all

*NL*
*NL*

I
do

said
Mary
,
more
quietly
,
``

my
anger

is
of
no
use

She
dried
her
eyes
,
threw
aside
her
book
,
rose
and
*NL*
fetched
her
sewing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fred
followed
her
with
his
eyes
,
hoping
that
they
would
meet
hers
,
and
*NL*
in
that
way
find
access
for
his
imploring
penitence
.
But
no
!
Mary
*NL*
could
easily
avoid
looking
upward
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
care
about
your
mother
's
money
going

he
said
,
when
she
was
*NL*
seated
again
and
sewing
quickly
.
``
I
wanted
to
ask

were

tell
him

tell
him

*NL*
*NL*
``
My

not
fond

you
a

hundred

He
rarely
makes
presents

he
has
never
made
presents

to
us

I
am
sure
my
father
will
not
ask
him
for
anything

even
if

I
chose
to
beg
of

it

*NL*
*NL*
``
There

other

I
see
enough
of
that
every

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
hardly
fair
to
call
me
selfish

must
be
selfish

not

``
How

*NL*
said
Mary
,
in
a
deep
tone
of
indignation
.
``
He
never
got
into
trouble
*NL*
by
thinking
of
his

idle
pleasures
,
but
because
he
was
always
*NL*
thinking
of
the
work
he
was
doing
for
other
people

he
has
fared

hard

worked
hard
to

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
think
that
I
shall
never

is
not
generous
to
believe
the
worst
of
a
man

When
you
have
got
any

power
over
him
,
I
think
you
might
try
and
use
it
to
make
him
better
;
*NL*
but
that
is
what
you
never
do

However
,
I
'm
going

Fred
ended
,
*NL*
languidly
.
``
I
shall
never
speak
to
you
about
anything
again

I
'm
very
*NL*
sorry
for
all
the

I
've
caused

that
's
all

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
had
dropped
her
work
out
of
her
hand
and
looked
up
.
There
is
*NL*
often
something
maternal
even
in
a
girlish
love
,
and
Mary
's
hard
*NL*
experience
had
wrought
her
nature
to
an
impressibility
very
different
*NL*
from
that
hard
slight
thing
which
we
call
girlishness
.
At
Fred
's
last
*NL*
words
she
felt
an
instantaneous
pang
,
something
like
what
a
mother
*NL*
feels
at
the
imagined
sobs
or
cries
of
her
naughty
truant
child
,
which
*NL*
may
lose
itself
and
get
harm
.
And
when
,
looking
up
,
her
eyes
met
his
*NL*
dull
despairing
glance
,
her
pity
for
him
surmounted
her
anger
and
all
*NL*
her
other
anxieties
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Fred
,
how
ill
you
look
!
Sit
down
a
moment
.
Do
n't
go
yet
.
Let
me
*NL*
tell
uncle
that
you
are
here
.
He
has
been
wondering
that
he
has
not
*NL*
seen
you
for
a
whole
week
.
''
Mary
spoke
hurriedly
,
saying
the
words
*NL*
that
came
first
without
knowing
very
well
what
they
were
,
but
saying
*NL*
them
in
a
half-soothing
half-beseeching
tone
,
and
rising
as
if
to
go
*NL*
away
to
Mr.
Featherstone
.
Of
course
Fred
felt
as
if
the
clouds
had
*NL*
parted
and
a
gleam
had
come
:
he
moved
and
stood
in
her
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
one
word
,
Mary
,

I
will
do
anything

Say
you

not
think
*NL*
the
worst
of
me
--
will
not
give
me
up
altogether
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
if
it
were
any
pleasure
to
me
to
think
ill
of
you

said
Mary
,
in
a
*NL*
mournful
tone
.
``
As
if
it
were
not
very
painful
to
me
to
see
you
an
*NL*
idle
frivolous
creature
.
How
can
you
bear
to
be
so
contemptible
,
when
*NL*
others
are
working
and
striving
,
and
there
are
so
many
things
to
be
*NL*
done
--
how
can
you
bear
to
be
fit
for
nothing
in
the
world
that
is
*NL*
useful
?
And
with
so
much
good
in
your
disposition
,
Fred
,
--
you
might
*NL*
be
worth
a
great
deal
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
try
to
be
anything
you
like

Mary

you
will
say
that
you
*NL*
love
me

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
be
ashamed
to
say
that
I
loved
a
man
who
must
always
be
*NL*
hanging
on
others
,
and
reckoning
on
what
they
would
do
for
him
.
What
*NL*
will
you
be
when
you
are
forty
?
Like
Mr.
Bowyer
,
I
suppose
--
just
as
*NL*
idle
,
living
in
Mrs.
Beck
's
front
parlor
--
fat
and
shabby
,
hoping
*NL*
somebody
will
invite
you
to
dinner
--
spending
your
morning
in
learning
a
*NL*
comic
song
--
oh
no
!
learning
a
tune
on
the
flute
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
's
lips
had
begun
to
curl
with
a
smile
as
soon
as
she
had
asked
*NL*
that
question
about
Fred
's
future
-LRB-
young
souls
are
mobile
-RRB-
,
and
before
*NL*
she
ended
,
her
face
had
its
full
illumination
of
fun
.
To
him
it
was
*NL*
like
the
cessation
of
an
ache
that
Mary
could
laugh
at
him
,
and
with
a
*NL*
passive
sort
of
smile
he
tried
to
reach
her
hand
;
but
she
slipped
away
*NL*
quickly
towards
the
door
and
said
,
``
I
shall
tell
uncle
.
You
_
must
_
see
*NL*
him
for
a
moment
or
two
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fred
secretly
felt
that
his
future
was
guaranteed
against
the
*NL*
fulfilment
of
Mary
's
sarcastic
prophecies
,
apart
from
that
``
anything
''
*NL*
which
he
was
ready
to
do
if
she
would
define
it
.
He
never
dared
in
*NL*
Mary
's
presence
to
approach
the
subject
of
his
expectations
from
Mr.
*NL*
Featherstone
,
and
she
always
ignored
them
,
as
if
everything
depended
on
*NL*
himself
.
But
if
ever
he
actually
came
into
the
property
,
she
must
*NL*
recognize
the
change
in
his
position
.
All
this
passed
through
his
mind
*NL*
somewhat
languidly
,
before
he
went
up
to
see
his
uncle
.
He
stayed
but
*NL*
a
little
while
,
excusing
himself
on
the
ground
that
he
had
a
cold
;
and
*NL*
Mary
did
not
reappear
before
he
left
the
house
.
But
as
he
rode
home
,
*NL*
he
began
to
be
more
conscious
of
being
ill
,
than
of
being
melancholy
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Caleb
Garth
arrived
at
Stone
Court
soon
after
dusk
,
Mary
was
not
*NL*
surprised
,
although
he
seldom
had
leisure
for
paying
her
a
visit
,
and
*NL*
was
not
at
all
fond
of
having
to
talk
with
Mr.
Featherstone
.
The
old
*NL*
man
,
on
the
other
hand
,
felt
himself
ill
at
ease
with
a
brother-in-law
*NL*
whom
he
could
not
annoy
,
who
did
not
mind
about
being
considered
poor
,
*NL*
had
nothing
to
ask
of
him
,
and
understood
all
kinds
of
farming
and
*NL*
mining
business
better
than
he
did
.
But
Mary
had
felt
sure
that
her
*NL*
parents
would
want
to
see
her
,
and
if
her
father
had
not
come
,
she
*NL*
would
have
obtained
leave
to
go
home
for
an
hour
or
two
the
next
day
.
*NL*
After
discussing
prices
during
tea
with
Mr.
Featherstone
Caleb
rose
to
*NL*
bid
him
good-by
,
and
said
,
``
I
want
to
speak
to
you
,
Mary
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
took
a
candle
into
another
large
parlor
,
where
there
was
no
fire
,
*NL*
and
setting
down
the
feeble
light
on
the
dark
mahogany
table
,
turned
*NL*
round
to
her
father
,
and
putting
her
arms
round
his
neck
kissed
him
*NL*
with
childish
kisses
which
he
delighted
in
,
--
the
expression
of
his
*NL*
large
brows
softening
as
the
expression
of
a
great
beautiful
dog
*NL*
softens
when
it
is
caressed
.
Mary
was
his
favorite
child
,
and
whatever
*NL*
Susan
might
say
,
and
right
as
she
was
on
all
other
subjects
,
Caleb
*NL*
thought
it
natural
that
Fred
or
any
one
else
should
think
Mary
more
*NL*
lovable
than
other
girls
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
got
something
to
tell
you
,
my
dear

''
said
Caleb
in
his
hesitating
*NL*
way
.
``
No
very
good
news

but
then
it
might
be
worse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
About

I
think
I
know
what
it
is

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay

how
can
that
be

see

've
been
a
bit
of
a
fool
again

*NL*
put
my
name
to
a
bill
,
and
now
it
comes
to
paying
;
and
your
mother
has
*NL*
got
to
part
with
her
savings

that
's
the
worst
of
it
,
and
even
they
*NL*
wo
n't
quite
make
things
even

wanted
a
hundred
and
ten
pounds
:
your
*NL*
mother
has
ninety-two
,
and
I
have
none
to
spare
in
the
bank
;

she
*NL*
thinks

you
have
some
savings

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes

have
more
than
four-and-twenty

bag

*NL*
Mary
took
out
the
folded
money
from

reticule

put
it
into
her

father
's
hand

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
Caleb
,
who
,
in
his
*NL*
unconquerable
indifference
to
money
,
was
beginning
to
be
chiefly
*NL*
concerned
about
the
relation
the
affair
might
have
to
Mary
's
affections
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fred
told
me
this
morning

afraid

said
the

with
*NL*
hesitating
tenderness
.
``
He
means
better

acts

perhaps

*NL*

not

putting

against
her
cheek

here
Caleb

voice
became
more
tender
;
he
had
been
pushing
his

hat
about
on
the

looking
at
it

finally
he
turned
his

turned

Mr.

shook
his

help
out
the
inadequacy
of
words
--
``
what
I
am
thinking
of
is

what
it
*NL*
must
be
for
a
wife
when
she
's
never
sure
of
her
husband
,
when
he
has
n't
*NL*
got
a
principle
in
him
to
make
him
more
afraid
of
doing
the
wrong
thing
*NL*
by
others
than
of
getting
his
own
toes
pinched

That
's
the
long
and
*NL*
the
short
of
it

Mary

Young
folks
may
get
fond
of
each
other
before
*NL*
they
know
what
life
is
,
and
they
may
think
it
all
holiday

they
can
*NL*
only
get
together

but
it
soon
turns
into
working
day

my
dear

*NL*
However
,
you
have
more
sense
than
most
,
and
you
have
n't
been
kept
in
*NL*
cotton-wool
:
there
may
be
no
occasion
for
me
to
say
this
,
but
a
father
*NL*
trembles
for
his
daughter

and
you
are
all
by
yourself
here

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
fear
for
me

father

''
said
Mary
,
gravely
meeting
her
father
's
*NL*
eyes
;
``
Fred
has
always
been
very
good
to
me

he
is
kind-hearted

affectionate
,
and
not
false

I
think
,
with
all
his
self-indulgence

But
*NL*
I
will
never
engage
myself
to
one
who
has
no
manly
independence
,
and
*NL*
who
goes
on
loitering
away
his
time
on
the
chance
that
others
will
*NL*
provide
for
him
.
You
and
my
mother
have
taught
me
too
much
pride
for
*NL*
that
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
right
--
that
's
right

Then
I
am
easy

said
Mr.
Garth
,
taking
*NL*
up
his
hat
.
``
But
it
's
hard
to
run
away
with
your
earnings

eh
child

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Father
!
''
said
Mary
,
in
her
deepest
tone
of
remonstrance
.
``
Take
*NL*
pocketfuls
of
love
besides
to
them
all
at
home
,
''
was
her
last
word
*NL*
before
he
closed
the
outer
door
on
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
your
father
wanted
your
earnings

''
said
old
Mr.
*NL*
Featherstone
,
with
his
usual
power
of
unpleasant
surmise
,
when
Mary
*NL*
returned
to
him
.
``
He
makes
but
a
tight
fit
,
I
reckon

You

of

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
consider
my
father

said
*NL*
Mary
,
coldly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Featherstone
grunted
:
he
could
not
deny
that
an
ordinary
sort
of
*NL*
girl
like
her
might
be
expected
to
be
useful
,
so
he
thought
of
another
*NL*
rejoinder
,
disagreeable
enough
to
be
always
apropos
.
``
If
Fred
Vincy
*NL*

CHAPTER
XXVI
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
beats
me
and
I
rail
at
him
:
O
worthy
satisfaction
!
*NL*
would
it
were
otherwise
--
that
I
could
beat
him
while
*NL*
he
railed
at
me

*NL*

Troilus
and
Cressida
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
But
Fred
did
not
go
to
Stone
Court
the
next
day
,
for
reasons
that
were
*NL*
quite
peremptory
.
From
those
visits
to
unsanitary
Houndsley
streets
in
*NL*
search
of
Diamond
,
he
had
brought
back
not
only
a
bad
bargain
in
*NL*
horse-flesh
,
but
the
further
misfortune
of
some
ailment
which
for
a
day
*NL*
or
two
had
deemed
mere
depression
and
headache
,
but
which
got
so
much
*NL*
worse
when
he
returned
from
his
visit
to
Stone
Court
that
,
going
into
*NL*
the
dining-room
,
he
threw
himself
on
the
sofa
,
and
in
answer
to
his
*NL*
mother
's
anxious
question
,
said
,
``
I
feel
very
ill
:
I
think
you
must
*NL*
send
for
Wrench
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Wrench
came
,
but
did
not
apprehend
anything
serious
,
spoke
of
a
``
slight
*NL*
derangement
,
''
and
did
not
speak
of
coming
again
on
the
morrow
.
He
had
*NL*
a
due
value
for
the
Vincys
'
house
,
but
the
wariest
men
are
apt
to
be
*NL*
dulled
by
routine
,
and
on
worried
mornings
will
sometimes
go
through
*NL*
their
business
with
the
zest
of
the
daily
bell-ringer
.
Mr.
Wrench
was
*NL*
a
small
,
neat
,
bilious
man
,
with
a
well-dressed
wig
:
he
had
a
laborious
*NL*
practice
,
an
irascible
temper
,
a
lymphatic
wife
and
seven
children
;
and
*NL*
he
was
already
rather
late
before
setting
out
on
a
four-miles
drive
to
*NL*
meet
Dr.
Minchin
on
the
other
side
of
Tipton
,
the
decease
of
Hicks
,
a
*NL*
rural
practitioner
,
having
increased
Middlemarch
practice
in
that
*NL*
direction
.
Great
statesmen
err
,
and
why
not
small
medical
men
?
Mr.
*NL*
Wrench
did
not
neglect
sending
the
usual
white
parcels
,
which
this
time
*NL*
had
black
and
drastic
contents
.
Their
effect
was
not
alleviating
to
*NL*
poor
Fred
,
who
,
however
,
unwilling
as
he
said
to
believe
that
he
was
*NL*
``
in
for
an
illness
,
''
rose
at
his
usual
easy
hour
the
next
morning
and
*NL*
went
down-stairs
meaning
to
breakfast
,
but
succeeded
in
nothing
but
in
*NL*
sitting
and
shivering
by
the
fire
.
Mr.
Wrench
was
again
sent
for
,
but
*NL*
was
gone
on
his
rounds
,
and
Mrs.
Vincy
seeing
her
darling
's
changed
*NL*
looks
and
general
misery
,
began
to
cry
and
said
she
would
send
for
Dr.
*NL*
Sprague
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
nonsense
,
mother
!
It
's
nothing
,
''
said
Fred
,
putting
out
his
hot
*NL*
dry
hand
to
her
,
``
I
shall
soon
be
all
right
.
I
must
have
taken
cold
in
*NL*
that
nasty
damp
ride
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mamma
!
''
said
Rosamond
,
who
was
seated
near
the
window
-LRB-
the
dining-room
*NL*
windows
looked
on
that
highly
respectable
street
called
Lowick
Gate
-RRB-
,
*NL*
``
there
is
Mr.
Lydgate
,
stopping
to
speak
to
some
one
.
If
I
were
you
I
*NL*
would
call
him
in
.
He
has
cured
Ellen
Bulstrode
.
They
say
he
cures
*NL*
every
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Vincy
sprang
to
the
window
and
opened
it
in
an
instant
,
thinking
*NL*
only
of
Fred
and
not
of
medical
etiquette
.
Lydgate
was
only
two
yards
*NL*
off
on
the
other
side
of
some
iron
palisading
,
and
turned
round
at
the
*NL*
sudden
sound
of
the
sash
,
before
she
called
to
him
.
In
two
minutes
he
*NL*
was
in
the
room
,
and
Rosamond
went
out
,
after
waiting
just
long
enough
*NL*
to
show
a
pretty
anxiety
conflicting
with
her
sense
of
what
was
*NL*
becoming
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lydgate
had
to
hear
a
narrative
in
which
Mrs.
Vincy
's
mind
insisted
*NL*
with
remarkable
instinct
on
every
point
of
minor
importance
,
especially
*NL*
on
what
Mr.
Wrench
had
said
and
had
not
said
about
coming
again
.
That
*NL*
there
might
be
an
awkward
affair
with
Wrench
,
Lydgate
saw
at
once
;
but
*NL*
the
case
was
serious
enough
to
make
him
dismiss
that
consideration
:
he
*NL*
was
convinced
that
Fred
was
in
the
pink-skinned
stage
of
typhoid
fever
,
*NL*
and
that
he
had
taken
just
the
wrong
medicines
.
He
must
go
to
bed
*NL*
immediately
,
must
have
a
regular
nurse
,
and
various
appliances
and
*NL*
precautions
must
be
used
,
about
which
Lydgate
was
particular
.
Poor
*NL*
Mrs.
Vincy
's
terror
at
these
indications
of
danger
found
vent
in
such
*NL*
words
as
came
most
easily
.
She
thought
it
``
very
ill
usage
on
the
part
*NL*
of
Mr.
Wrench
,
who
had
attended
their
house
so
many
years
in
preference
*NL*
to
Mr.
Peacock
,
though
Mr.
Peacock
was
equally
a
friend
.
Why
Mr.
*NL*
Wrench
should
neglect
her
children
more
than
others
,
she
could
not
for
*NL*
the
life
of
her
understand
.
He
had
not
neglected
Mrs.
Larcher
's
when
*NL*
they
had
the
measles
,
nor
indeed
would
Mrs.
Vincy
have
wished
that
he
*NL*
should
.
And
if
anything
should
happen
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
poor
Mrs.
Vincy
's
spirit
quite
broke
down
,
and
her
Niobe
throat
*NL*
and
good-humored
face
were
sadly
convulsed
.
This
was
in
the
hall
out
*NL*
of
Fred
's
hearing
,
but
Rosamond
had
opened
the
drawing-room
door
,
and
*NL*
now
came
forward
anxiously
.
Lydgate
apologized
for
Mr.
Wrench
,
said
*NL*
that
the
symptoms
yesterday
might
have
been
disguising
,
and
that
this
*NL*
form
of
fever
was
very
equivocal
in
its
beginnings
:
he
would
go
*NL*
immediately
to
the
druggist
's
and
have
a
prescription
made
up
in
order
*NL*
to
lose
no
time
,
but
he
would
write
to
Mr.
Wrench
and
tell
him
what
had
*NL*
been
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
must
come
again
--
you
must
go
on
attending
Fred
.
I
ca
n't
have
*NL*
my
boy
left
to
anybody
who
may
come
or
not
.
I
bear
nobody
ill-will
,
*NL*
thank
God
,
and
Mr.
Wrench
saved
me
in
the
pleurisy
,
but
he
'd
better
*NL*
have
let
me
die
--
if
--
if
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
meet
Mr.
Wrench
here
,
then
,
shall
I
?
''
said
Lydgate
,
really
*NL*
believing
that
Wrench
was
not
well
prepared
to
deal
wisely
with
a
case
*NL*
of
this
kind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pray
make
that
arrangement
,
Mr.
Lydgate
,
''
said
Rosamond
,
coming
to
her
*NL*
mother
's
aid
,
and
supporting
her
arm
to
lead
her
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Mr.
Vincy
came
home
he
was
very
angry
with
Wrench
,
and
did
not
*NL*
care
if
he
never
came
into
his
house
again
.
Lydgate
should
go
on
now
,
*NL*
whether
Wrench
liked
it
or
not
.
It
was
no
joke
to
have
fever
in
the
*NL*
house
.
Everybody
must
be
sent
to
now
,
not
to
come
to
dinner
on
*NL*
Thursday
.
And
Pritchard
need
n't
get
up
any
wine
:
brandy
was
the
best
*NL*
thing
against
infection
.
``
I
shall
drink
brandy
,
''
added
Mr.
Vincy
,
*NL*
emphatically
--
as
much
as
to
say
,
this
was
not
an
occasion
for
firing
*NL*
with
blank-cartridges
.
``
He
's
an
uncommonly
unfortunate
lad
,
is
Fred
.
*NL*
He
'd
need
have
--
some
luck
by-and-by
to
make
up
for
all
this
--
else
I
*NL*
do
n't
know
who
'd
have
an
eldest
son
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
say
so
,
Vincy
,
''
said
the
mother
,
with
a
quivering
lip
,
``
if
you
*NL*
do
n't
want
him
to
be
taken
from
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
will
worret
you
to
death
,
Lucy
;
_
that
_
I
can
see
,
''
said
Mr.
Vincy
,
*NL*
more
mildly
.
``
However
,
Wrench
shall
know
what
I
think
of
the
matter
.
''
*NL*
-LRB-
What
Mr.
Vincy
thought
confusedly
was
,
that
the
fever
might
somehow
*NL*
have
been
hindered
if
Wrench
had
shown
the
proper
solicitude
about
*NL*
his
--
the
Mayor
's
--
family
.
-RRB-
``
I
'm
the
last
man
to
give
in
to
the
cry
*NL*
about
new
doctors
,
or
new
parsons
either
--
whether
they
're
Bulstrode
's
*NL*
men
or
not
.
But
Wrench
shall
know
what
I
think
,
take
it
as
he
will
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Wrench
did
not
take
it
at
all
well
.
Lydgate
was
as
polite
as
he
could
*NL*
be
in
his
offhand
way
,
but
politeness
in
a
man
who
has
placed
you
at
a
*NL*
disadvantage
is
only
an
additional
exasperation
,
especially
if
he
*NL*
happens
to
have
been
an
object
of
dislike
beforehand
.
Country
*NL*
practitioners
used
to
be
an
irritable
species
,
susceptible
on
the
point
*NL*
of
honor
;
and
Mr.
Wrench
was
one
of
the
most
irritable
among
them
.
He
*NL*
did
not
refuse
to
meet
Lydgate
in
the
evening
,
but
his
temper
was
*NL*
somewhat
tried
on
the
occasion
.
He
had
to
hear
Mrs.
Vincy
say
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Mr.
Wrench
,
what
have
I
ever
done
that
you
should
use
me
so
?
--
To
*NL*
go
away
,
and
never
to
come
again
!
And
my
boy
might
have
been
stretched
*NL*
a
corpse
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Vincy
,
who
had
been
keeping
up
a
sharp
fire
on
the
enemy
Infection
,
*NL*
and
was
a
good
deal
heated
in
consequence
,
started
up
when
he
heard
*NL*
Wrench
come
in
,
and
went
into
the
hall
to
let
him
know
what
he
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
tell
you
what
,
Wrench
,
this
is
beyond
a
joke
,
''
said
the
Mayor
,
*NL*
who
of
late
had
had
to
rebuke
offenders
with
an
official
air
,
and
how
*NL*
broadened
himself
by
putting
his
thumbs
in
his
armholes
.
--
``
To
let
*NL*
fever
get
unawares
into
a
house
like
this
.
There
are
some
things
that
*NL*
ought
to
be
actionable
,
and
are
not
so
--
that
's
my
opinion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
irrational
reproaches
were
easier
to
bear
than
the
sense
of
being
*NL*
instructed
,
or
rather
the
sense
that
a
younger
man
,
like
Lydgate
,
*NL*
inwardly
considered
him
in
need
of
instruction
,
for
``
in
point
of
fact
,
''
*NL*
Mr.
Wrench
afterwards
said
,
Lydgate
paraded
flighty
,
foreign
notions
,
*NL*
which
would
not
wear
.
He
swallowed
his
ire
for
the
moment
,
but
he
*NL*
afterwards
wrote
to
decline
further
attendance
in
the
case
.
The
house
*NL*
might
be
a
good
one
,
but
Mr.
Wrench
was
not
going
to
truckle
to
anybody
*NL*
on
a
professional
matter
.
He
reflected
,
with
much
probability
on
his
*NL*
side
,
that
Lydgate
would
by-and-by
be
caught
tripping
too
,
and
that
his
*NL*
ungentlemanly
attempts
to
discredit
the
sale
of
drugs
by
his
*NL*
professional
brethren
,
would
by-and-by
recoil
on
himself
.
He
threw
out
*NL*
biting
remarks
on
Lydgate
's
tricks
,
worthy
only
of
a
quack
,
to
get
*NL*
himself
a
factitious
reputation
with
credulous
people
.
That
cant
about
*NL*
cures
was
never
got
up
by
sound
practitioners
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
a
point
on
which
Lydgate
smarted
as
much
as
Wrench
could
*NL*
desire
.
To
be
puffed
by
ignorance
was
not
only
humiliating
,
but
*NL*
perilous
,
and
not
more
enviable
than
the
reputation
of
the
*NL*
weather-prophet
.
He
was
impatient
of
the
foolish
expectations
amidst
*NL*
which
all
work
must
be
carried
on
,
and
likely
enough
to
damage
himself
*NL*
as
much
as
Mr.
Wrench
could
wish
,
by
an
unprofessional
openness
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
Lydgate
was
installed
as
medical
attendant
on
the
Vincys
,
and
*NL*
the
event
was
a
subject
of
general
conversation
in
Middlemarch
.
Some
*NL*
said
,
that
the
Vincys
had
behaved
scandalously
,
that
Mr.
Vincy
had
*NL*
threatened
Wrench
,
and
that
Mrs.
Vincy
had
accused
him
of
poisoning
her
*NL*
son
.
Others
were
of
opinion
that
Mr.
Lydgate
's
passing
by
was
*NL*
providential
,
that
he
was
wonderfully
clever
in
fevers
,
and
that
*NL*
Bulstrode
was
in
the
right
to
bring
him
forward
.
Many
people
believed
*NL*
that
Lydgate
's
coming
to
the
town
at
all
was
really
due
to
Bulstrode
;
*NL*
and
Mrs.
Taft
,
who
was
always
counting
stitches
and
gathered
her
*NL*
information
in
misleading
fragments
caught
between
the
rows
of
her
*NL*
knitting
,
had
got
it
into
her
head
that
Mr.
Lydgate
was
a
natural
son
*NL*
of
Bulstrode
's
,
a
fact
which
seemed
to
justify
her
suspicions
of
*NL*
evangelical
laymen
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
one
day
communicated
this
piece
of
knowledge
to
Mrs.
Farebrother
,
*NL*
who
did
not
fail
to
tell
her
son
of
it
,
observing
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
not
be
surprised
at
anything
in
Bulstrode
,
but
I
should
be
*NL*
sorry
to
think
it
of
Mr.
Lydgate
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
mother
,
''
said
Mr.
Farebrother
,
after
an
explosive
laugh
,
``
you
*NL*
know
very
well
that
Lydgate
is
of
a
good
family
in
the
North
.
He
never
*NL*
heard
of
Bulstrode
before
he
came
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
satisfactory
so
far
as
Mr.
Lydgate
is
concerned
,
Camden
,
''
said
*NL*
the
old
lady
,
with
an
air
of
precision
.
--
``
But
as
to
Bulstrode
--
the
*NL*
report
may
be
true
of
some
other
son
.

CHAPTER
XXVII
.
*NL*
*NL*
Let
the
high
Muse
chant
loves
Olympian
:
*NL*
We
are
but
mortals
,
and
must
sing
of
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
An
eminent
philosopher
among
my
friends
,
who
can
dignify
even
your
ugly
*NL*
furniture
by
lifting
it
into
the
serene
light
of
science
,
has
shown
me
*NL*
this
pregnant
little
fact
.
Your
pier-glass
or
extensive
surface
of
*NL*
polished
steel
made
to
be
rubbed
by
a
housemaid
,
will
be
minutely
and
*NL*
multitudinously
scratched
in
all
directions
;
but
place
now
against
it
a
*NL*
lighted
candle
as
a
centre
of
illumination
,
and
lo
!
the
scratches
will
*NL*
seem
to
arrange
themselves
in
a
fine
series
of
concentric
circles
round
*NL*
that
little
sun
.
It
is
demonstrable
that
the
scratches
are
going
*NL*
everywhere
impartially
and
it
is
only
your
candle
which
produces
the
*NL*
flattering
illusion
of
a
concentric
arrangement
,
its
light
falling
with
*NL*
an
exclusive
optical
selection
.
These
things
are
a
parable
.
The
*NL*
scratches
are
events
,
and
the
candle
is
the
egoism
of
any
person
now
*NL*
absent
--
of
Miss
Vincy
,
for
example
.
Rosamond
had
a
Providence
of
her
*NL*
own
who
had
kindly
made
her
more
charming
than
other
girls
,
and
who
*NL*
seemed
to
have
arranged
Fred
's
illness
and
Mr.
Wrench
's
mistake
in
*NL*
order
to
bring
her
and
Lydgate
within
effective
proximity
.
It
would
*NL*
have
been
to
contravene
these
arrangements
if
Rosamond
had
consented
to
*NL*
go
away
to
Stone
Court
or
elsewhere
,
as
her
parents
wished
her
to
do
,
*NL*
especially
since
Mr.
Lydgate
thought
the
precaution
needless
.
*NL*
Therefore
,
while
Miss
Morgan
and
the
children
were
sent
away
to
a
*NL*
farmhouse
the
morning
after
Fred
's
illness
had
declared
itself
,
*NL*
Rosamond
refused
to
leave
papa
and
mamma
.
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
mamma
indeed
was
an
object
to
touch
any
creature
born
of
woman
;
*NL*
and
Mr.
Vincy
,
who
doted
on
his
wife
,
was
more
alarmed
on
her
account
*NL*
than
on
Fred
's
.
But
for
his
insistence
she
would
have
taken
no
rest
:
*NL*
her
brightness
was
all
bedimmed
;
unconscious
of
her
costume
which
had
*NL*
always
been
so
fresh
and
gay
,
she
was
like
a
sick
bird
with
languid
eye
*NL*
and
plumage
ruffled
,
her
senses
dulled
to
the
sights
and
sounds
that
*NL*
used
most
to
interest
her
.
Fred
's
delirium
,
in
which
he
seemed
to
be
*NL*
wandering
out
of
her
reach
,
tore
her
heart
.
After
her
first
outburst
*NL*
against
Mr.
Wrench
she
went
about
very
quietly
:
her
one
low
cry
was
to
*NL*
Lydgate
.
She
would
follow
him
out
of
the
room
and
put
her
hand
on
his
*NL*
arm
moaning
out
,
``
Save
my
boy
.
''
Once
she
pleaded
,
``
He
has
always
been
*NL*
good
to
me
,
Mr.
Lydgate
:
he
never
had
a
hard
word
for
his
mother
,
''
--
as
*NL*
if
poor
Fred
's
suffering
were
an
accusation
against
him
.
All
the
*NL*
deepest
fibres
of
the
mother
's
memory
were
stirred
,
and
the
young
man
*NL*
whose
voice
took
a
gentler
tone
when
he
spoke
to
her
,
was
one
with
the
*NL*
babe
whom
she
had
loved
,
with
a
love
new
to
her
,
before
he
was
born
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
good
hope
,
Mrs.
Vincy
,
''
Lydgate
would
say
.
``
Come
down
with
me
*NL*
and
let
us
talk
about
the
food
.
''
In
that
way
he
led
her
to
the
parlor
*NL*
where
Rosamond
was
,
and
made
a
change
for
her
,
surprising
her
into
*NL*
taking
some
tea
or
broth
which
had
been
prepared
for
her
.
There
was
a
*NL*
constant
understanding
between
him
and
Rosamond
on
these
matters
.
He
*NL*
almost
always
saw
her
before
going
to
the
sickroom
,
and
she
appealed
to
*NL*
him
as
to
what
she
could
do
for
mamma
.
Her
presence
of
mind
and
*NL*
adroitness
in
carrying
out
his
hints
were
admirable
,
and
it
is
not
*NL*
wonderful
that
the
idea
of
seeing
Rosamond
began
to
mingle
itself
with
*NL*
his
interest
in
the
case
.
Especially
when
the
critical
stage
was
*NL*
passed
,
and
he
began
to
feel
confident
of
Fred
's
recovery
.
In
the
more
*NL*
doubtful
time
,
he
had
advised
calling
in
Dr.
Sprague
-LRB-
who
,
if
he
could
,
*NL*
would
rather
have
remained
neutral
on
Wrench
's
account
-RRB-
;
but
after
two
*NL*
consultations
,
the
conduct
of
the
case
was
left
to
Lydgate
,
and
there
*NL*
was
every
reason
to
make
him
assiduous
.
Morning
and
evening
he
was
at
*NL*
Mr.
Vincy
's
,
and
gradually
the
visits
became
cheerful
as
Fred
became
*NL*
simply
feeble
,
and
lay
not
only
in
need
of
the
utmost
petting
but
*NL*
conscious
of
it
,
so
that
Mrs.
Vincy
felt
as
if
,
after
all
,
the
illness
*NL*
had
made
a
festival
for
her
tenderness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Both
father
and
mother
held
it
an
added
reason
for
good
spirits
,
when
*NL*
old
Mr.
Featherstone
sent
messages
by
Lydgate
,
saying
that
Fred
must
*NL*
make
haste
and
get
well
,
as
he
,
Peter
Featherstone
,
could
not
do
*NL*
without
him
,
and
missed
his
visits
sadly
.
The
old
man
himself
was
*NL*
getting
bedridden
.
Mrs.
Vincy
told
these
messages
to
Fred
when
he
*NL*
could
listen
,
and
he
turned
towards
her
his
delicate
,
pinched
face
,
*NL*
from
which
all
the
thick
blond
hair
had
been
cut
away
,
and
in
which
the
*NL*
eyes
seemed
to
have
got
larger
,
yearning
for
some
word
about
*NL*
Mary
--
wondering
what
she
felt
about
his
illness
.
No
word
passed
his
*NL*
lips
;
but
``
to
hear
with
eyes
belongs
to
love
's
rare
wit
,
''
and
the
*NL*
mother
in
the
fulness
of
her
heart
not
only
divined
Fred
's
longing
,
but
*NL*
felt
ready
for
any
sacrifice
in
order
to
satisfy
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
can
only
see
my
boy
strong
again
,
''
she
said
,
in
her
loving
folly
;
*NL*
``
and
who
knows
?
--
perhaps
master
of
Stone
Court
!
and
he
can
marry
*NL*
anybody
he
likes
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
if
they
wo
n't
have
me
,
mother
,
''
said
Fred
.
The
illness
had
made
*NL*
him
childish
,
and
tears
came
as
he
spoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
take
a
bit
of
jelly
,
my
dear
,
''
said
Mrs.
Vincy
,
secretly
*NL*
incredulous
of
any
such
refusal
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
never
left
Fred
's
side
when
her
husband
was
not
in
the
house
,
and
*NL*
thus
Rosamond
was
in
the
unusual
position
of
being
much
alone
.
*NL*
Lydgate
,
naturally
,
never
thought
of
staying
long
with
her
,
yet
it
*NL*
seemed
that
the
brief
impersonal
conversations
they
had
together
were
*NL*
creating
that
peculiar
intimacy
which
consists
in
shyness
.
They
were
*NL*
obliged
to
look
at
each
other
in
speaking
,
and
somehow
the
looking
*NL*
could
not
be
carried
through
as
the
matter
of
course
which
it
really
*NL*
was
.
Lydgate
began
to
feel
this
sort
of
consciousness
unpleasant
and
*NL*
one
day
looked
down
,
or
anywhere
,
like
an
ill-worked
puppet
.
But
this
*NL*
turned
out
badly
:
the
next
day
,
Rosamond
looked
down
,
and
the
*NL*
consequence
was
that
when
their
eyes
met
again
,
both
were
more
*NL*
conscious
than
before
.
There
was
no
help
for
this
in
science
,
and
as
*NL*
Lydgate
did
not
want
to
flirt
,
there
seemed
to
be
no
help
for
it
in
*NL*
folly
.
It
was
therefore
a
relief
when
neighbors
no
longer
considered
*NL*
the
house
in
quarantine
,
and
when
the
chances
of
seeing
Rosamond
alone
*NL*
were
very
much
reduced
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
that
intimacy
of
mutual
embarrassment
,
in
which
each
feels
that
the
*NL*
other
is
feeling
something
,
having
once
existed
,
its
effect
is
not
to
*NL*
be
done
away
with
.
Talk
about
the
weather
and
other
well-bred
topics
*NL*
is
apt
to
seem
a
hollow
device
,
and
behavior
can
hardly
become
easy
*NL*
unless
it
frankly
recognizes
a
mutual
fascination
--
which
of
course
need
*NL*
not
mean
anything
deep
or
serious
.
This
was
the
way
in
which
Rosamond
*NL*
and
Lydgate
slid
gracefully
into
ease
,
and
made
their
intercourse
*NL*
lively
again
.
Visitors
came
and
went
as
usual
,
there
was
once
more
*NL*
music
in
the
drawing-room
,
and
all
the
extra
hospitality
of
Mr.
Vincy
's
*NL*
mayoralty
returned
.
Lydgate
,
whenever
he
could
,
took
his
seat
by
*NL*
Rosamond
's
side
,
and
lingered
to
hear
her
music
,
calling
himself
her
*NL*
captive
--
meaning
,
all
the
while
,
not
to
be
her
captive
.
The
*NL*
preposterousness
of
the
notion
that
he
could
at
once
set
up
a
*NL*
satisfactory
establishment
as
a
married
man
was
a
sufficient
guarantee
*NL*
against
danger
.
This
play
at
being
a
little
in
love
was
agreeable
,
and
*NL*
did
not
interfere
with
graver
pursuits
.
Flirtation
,
after
all
,
was
not
*NL*
necessarily
a
singeing
process
.
Rosamond
,
for
her
part
,
had
never
*NL*
enjoyed
the
days
so
much
in
her
life
before
:
she
was
sure
of
being
*NL*
admired
by
some
one
worth
captivating
,
and
she
did
not
distinguish
*NL*
flirtation
from
love
,
either
in
herself
or
in
another
.
She
seemed
to
*NL*
be
sailing
with
a
fair
wind
just
whither
she
would
go
,
and
her
thoughts
*NL*
were
much
occupied
with
a
handsome
house
in
Lowick
Gate
which
she
hoped
*NL*
would
by-and-by
be
vacant
.
She
was
quite
determined
,
when
she
was
*NL*
married
,
to
rid
herself
adroitly
of
all
the
visitors
who
were
not
*NL*
agreeable
to
her
at
her
father
's
;
and
she
imagined
the
drawing-room
in
*NL*
her
favorite
house
with
various
styles
of
furniture
.
*NL*
*NL*
Certainly
her
thoughts
were
much
occupied
with
Lydgate
himself
;
he
*NL*
seemed
to
her
almost
perfect
:
if
he
had
known
his
notes
so
that
his
*NL*
enchantment
under
her
music
had
been
less
like
an
emotional
elephant
's
,
*NL*
and
if
he
had
been
able
to
discriminate
better
the
refinements
of
her
*NL*
taste
in
dress
,
she
could
hardly
have
mentioned
a
deficiency
in
him
.
*NL*
How
different
he
was
from
young
Plymdale
or
Mr.
Caius
Larcher
!
Those
*NL*
young
men
had
not
a
notion
of
French
,
and
could
speak
on
no
subject
*NL*
with
striking
knowledge
,
except
perhaps
the
dyeing
and
carrying
trades
,
*NL*
which
of
course
they
were
ashamed
to
mention
;
they
were
Middlemarch
*NL*
gentry
,
elated
with
their
silver-headed
whips
and
satin
stocks
,
but
*NL*
embarrassed
in
their
manners
,
and
timidly
jocose
:
even
Fred
was
above
*NL*
them
,
having
at
least
the
accent
and
manner
of
a
university
man
.
*NL*
Whereas
Lydgate
was
always
listened
to
,
bore
himself
with
the
careless
*NL*
politeness
of
conscious
superiority
,
and
seemed
to
have
the
right
*NL*
clothes
on
by
a
certain
natural
affinity
,
without
ever
having
to
think
*NL*
about
them
.
Rosamond
was
proud
when
he
entered
the
room
,
and
when
he
*NL*
approached
her
with
a
distinguishing
smile
,
she
had
a
delicious
sense
*NL*
that
she
was
the
object
of
enviable
homage
.
If
Lydgate
had
been
aware
*NL*
of
all
the
pride
he
excited
in
that
delicate
bosom
,
he
might
have
been
*NL*
just
as
well
pleased
as
any
other
man
,
even
the
most
densely
ignorant
*NL*
of
humoral
pathology
or
fibrous
tissue
:
he
held
it
one
of
the
prettiest
*NL*
attitudes
of
the
feminine
mind
to
adore
a
man
's
pre-eminence
without
*NL*
too
precise
a
knowledge
of
what
it
consisted
in
.
But
Rosamond
was
not
*NL*
one
of
those
helpless
girls
who
betray
themselves
unawares
,
and
whose
*NL*
behavior
is
awkwardly
driven
by
their
impulses
,
instead
of
being
*NL*
steered
by
wary
grace
and
propriety
.
Do
you
imagine
that
her
rapid
*NL*
forecast
and
rumination
concerning
house-furniture
and
society
were
*NL*
ever
discernible
in
her
conversation
,
even
with
her
mamma
?
On
the
*NL*
contrary
,
she
would
have
expressed
the
prettiest
surprise
and
*NL*
disapprobation
if
she
had
heard
that
another
young
lady
had
been
*NL*
detected
in
that
immodest
prematureness
--
indeed
,
would
probably
have
*NL*
disbelieved
in
its
possibility
.
For
Rosamond
never
showed
any
*NL*
unbecoming
knowledge
,
and
was
always
that
combination
of
correct
*NL*
sentiments
,
music
,
dancing
,
drawing
,
elegant
note-writing
,
private
*NL*
album
for
extracted
verse
,
and
perfect
blond
loveliness
,
which
made
the
*NL*
irresistible
woman
for
the
doomed
man
of
that
date
.
Think
no
unfair
*NL*
evil
of
her
,
pray
:
she
had
no
wicked
plots
,
nothing
sordid
or
*NL*
mercenary
;
in
fact
,
she
never
thought
of
money
except
as
something
*NL*
necessary
which
other
people
would
always
provide
.
She
was
not
in
the
*NL*
habit
of
devising
falsehoods
,
and
if
her
statements
were
no
direct
clew
*NL*
to
fact
,
why
,
they
were
not
intended
in
that
light
--
they
were
among
*NL*
her
elegant
accomplishments
,
intended
to
please
.
Nature
had
inspired
*NL*
many
arts
in
finishing
Mrs.
Lemon
's
favorite
pupil
,
who
by
general
*NL*
consent
-LRB-
Fred
's
excepted
-RRB-
was
a
rare
compound
of
beauty
,
cleverness
,
*NL*
and
amiability
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lydgate
found
it
more
and
more
agreeable
to
be
with
her
,
and
there
was
*NL*
no
constraint
now
,
there
was
a
delightful
interchange
of
influence
in
*NL*
their
eyes
,
and
what
they
said
had
that
superfluity
of
meaning
for
*NL*
them
,
which
is
observable
with
some
sense
of
flatness
by
a
third
*NL*
person
;
still
they
had
no
interviews
or
asides
from
which
a
third
*NL*
person
need
have
been
excluded
.
In
fact
,
they
flirted
;
and
Lydgate
was
*NL*
secure
in
the
belief
that
they
did
nothing
else
.
If
a
man
could
not
*NL*
love
and
be
wise
,
surely
he
could
flirt
and
be
wise
at
the
same
time
?
*NL*
Really
,
the
men
in
Middlemarch
,
except
Mr.
Farebrother
,
were
great
*NL*
bores
,
and
Lydgate
did
not
care
about
commercial
politics
or
cards
:
*NL*
what
was
he
to
do
for
relaxation
?
He
was
often
invited
to
the
*NL*
Bulstrodes
'
;
but
the
girls
there
were
hardly
out
of
the
schoolroom
;
and
*NL*
Mrs.
Bulstrode
's
_
naive
_
way
of
conciliating
piety
and
worldliness
,
the
*NL*
nothingness
of
this
life
and
the
desirability
of
cut
glass
,
the
*NL*
consciousness
at
once
of
filthy
rags
and
the
best
damask
,
was
not
a
*NL*
sufficient
relief
from
the
weight
of
her
husband
's
invariable
*NL*
seriousness
.
The
Vincys
'
house
,
with
all
its
faults
,
was
the
*NL*
pleasanter
by
contrast
;
besides
,
it
nourished
Rosamond
--
sweet
to
look
*NL*
at
as
a
half-opened
blush-rose
,
and
adorned
with
accomplishments
for
*NL*
the
refined
amusement
of
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
made
some
enemies
,
other
than
medical
,
by
his
success
with
Miss
*NL*
Vincy
.
One
evening
he
came
into
the
drawing-room
rather
late
,
when
*NL*
several
other
visitors
were
there
.
The
card-table
had
drawn
off
the
*NL*
elders
,
and
Mr.
Ned
Plymdale
-LRB-
one
of
the
good
matches
in
Middlemarch
,
*NL*
though
not
one
of
its
leading
minds
-RRB-
was
in
tete-a-tete
with
Rosamond
.
*NL*
He
had
brought
the
last
``
Keepsake
,
''
the
gorgeous
watered-silk
*NL*
publication
which
marked
modern
progress
at
that
time
;
and
he
*NL*
considered
himself
very
fortunate
that
he
could
be
the
first
to
look
*NL*
over
it
with
her
,
dwelling
on
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
with
shiny
*NL*
copper-plate
cheeks
and
copper-plate
smiles
,
and
pointing
to
comic
*NL*
verses
as
capital
and
sentimental
stories
as
interesting
.
Rosamond
was
*NL*
gracious
,
and
Mr.
Ned
was
satisfied
that
he
had
the
very
best
thing
in
*NL*
art
and
literature
as
a
medium
for
``
paying
addresses
''
--
the
very
thing
*NL*
to
please
a
nice
girl
.
He
had
also
reasons
,
deep
rather
than
*NL*
ostensible
,
for
being
satisfied
with
his
own
appearance
.
To
*NL*
superficial
observers
his
chin
had
too
vanishing
an
aspect
,
looking
as
*NL*
if
it
were
being
gradually
reabsorbed
.
And
it
did
indeed
cause
him
*NL*
some
difficulty
about
the
fit
of
his
satin
stocks
,
for
which
chins
were
*NL*
at
that
time
useful
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
the
Honorable
Mrs.
S.
is
something
like
you
,
''
said
Mr.
Ned
.
*NL*
He
kept
the
book
open
at
the
bewitching
portrait
,
and
looked
at
it
*NL*
rather
languishingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Her
back
is
very
large
;
she
seems
to
have
sat
for
that
,
''
said
*NL*
Rosamond
,
not
meaning
any
satire
,
but
thinking
how
red
young
Plymdale
's
*NL*
hands
were
,
and
wondering
why
Lydgate
did
not
come
.
She
went
on
with
*NL*
her
tatting
all
the
while
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
not
say
she
was
as
beautiful
as
you
are
,
''
said
Mr.
Ned
,
*NL*
venturing
to
look
from
the
portrait
to
its
rival
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suspect
you
of
being
an
adroit
flatterer
,
''
said
Rosamond
,
feeling
*NL*
sure
that
she
should
have
to
reject
this
young
gentleman
a
second
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
now
Lydgate
came
in
;
the
book
was
closed
before
he
reached
*NL*
Rosamond
's
corner
,
and
as
he
took
his
seat
with
easy
confidence
on
the
*NL*
other
side
of
her
,
young
Plymdale
's
jaw
fell
like
a
barometer
towards
*NL*
the
cheerless
side
of
change
.
Rosamond
enjoyed
not
only
Lydgate
's
*NL*
presence
but
its
effect
:
she
liked
to
excite
jealousy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
late
comer
you
are
!
''
she
said
,
as
they
shook
hands
.
``
Mamma
had
*NL*
given
you
up
a
little
while
ago
.
How
do
you
find
Fred
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
usual
;
going
on
well
,
but
slowly
.
I
want
him
to
go
away
--
to
Stone
*NL*
Court
,
for
example
.
But
your
mamma
seems
to
have
some
objection
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
fellow
!
''
said
Rosamond
,
prettily
.
``
You
will
see
Fred
so
*NL*
changed
,
''
she
added
,
turning
to
the
other
suitor
;
``
we
have
looked
to
*NL*
Mr.
Lydgate
as
our
guardian
angel
during
this
illness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Ned
smiled
nervously
,
while
Lydgate
,
drawing
the
``
Keepsake
''
towards
*NL*
him
and
opening
it
,
gave
a
short
scornful
laugh
and
tossed
up
his
*NL*
chin
,
as
if
in
wonderment
at
human
folly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
laughing
at
so
profanely
?
''
said
Rosamond
,
with
bland
*NL*
neutrality
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wonder
which
would
turn
out
to
be
the
silliest
--
the
engravings
or
*NL*
the
writing
here
,
''
said
Lydgate
,
in
his
most
convinced
tone
,
while
he
*NL*
turned
over
the
pages
quickly
,
seeming
to
see
all
through
the
book
in
*NL*
no
time
,
and
showing
his
large
white
hands
to
much
advantage
,
as
*NL*
Rosamond
thought
.
``
Do
look
at
this
bridegroom
coming
out
of
church
:
*NL*
did
you
ever
see
such
a
`
sugared
invention
'
--
as
the
Elizabethans
used
*NL*
to
say
?
Did
any
haberdasher
ever
look
so
smirking
?
Yet
I
will
answer
*NL*
for
it
the
story
makes
him
one
of
the
first
gentlemen
in
the
land
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
so
severe
,
I
am
frightened
at
you
,
''
said
Rosamond
,
keeping
her
*NL*
amusement
duly
moderate
.
Poor
young
Plymdale
had
lingered
with
*NL*
admiration
over
this
very
engraving
,
and
his
spirit
was
stirred
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
a
great
many
celebrated
people
writing
in
the
`
Keepsake
,
'
at
*NL*
all
events
,
''
he
said
,
in
a
tone
at
once
piqued
and
timid
.
``
This
is
the
*NL*
first
time
I
have
heard
it
called
silly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
shall
turn
round
on
you
and
accuse
you
of
being
a
Goth
,
''
*NL*
said
Rosamond
,
looking
at
Lydgate
with
a
smile
.
``
I
suspect
you
know
*NL*
nothing
about
Lady
Blessington
and
L.
E.
L.
''
Rosamond
herself
was
not
*NL*
without
relish
for
these
writers
,
but
she
did
not
readily
commit
*NL*
herself
by
admiration
,
and
was
alive
to
the
slightest
hint
that
*NL*
anything
was
not
,
according
to
Lydgate
,
in
the
very
highest
taste
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
Sir
Walter
Scott
--
I
suppose
Mr.
Lydgate
knows
him
,
''
said
young
*NL*
Plymdale
,
a
little
cheered
by
this
advantage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
read
no
literature
now
,
''
said
Lydgate
,
shutting
the
book
,
and
*NL*
pushing
it
away
.
``
I
read
so
much
when
I
was
a
lad
,
that
I
suppose
it
*NL*
will
last
me
all
my
life
.
I
used
to
know
Scott
's
poems
by
heart
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
like
to
know
when
you
left
off
,
''
said
Rosamond
,
``
because
then
*NL*
I
might
be
sure
that
I
knew
something
which
you
did
not
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Lydgate
would
say
that
was
not
worth
knowing
,
''
said
Mr.
Ned
,
*NL*
purposely
caustic
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
contrary
,
''
said
Lydgate
,
showing
no
smart
;
but
smiling
with
*NL*
exasperating
confidence
at
Rosamond
.
``
It
would
be
worth
knowing
by
the
*NL*
fact
that
Miss
Vincy
could
tell
it
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Young
Plymdale
soon
went
to
look
at
the
whist-playing
,
thinking
that
*NL*
Lydgate
was
one
of
the
most
conceited
,
unpleasant
fellows
it
had
ever
*NL*
been
his
ill-fortune
to
meet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
rash
you
are
!
''
said
Rosamond
,
inwardly
delighted
.
``
Do
you
see
*NL*
that
you
have
given
offence
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
is
it
Mr.
Plymdale
's
book
?
I
am
sorry
.
I
did
n't
think
about
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
begin
to
admit
what
you
said
of
yourself
when
you
first
came
*NL*
here
--
that
you
are
a
bear
,
and
want
teaching
by
the
birds
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
there
is
a
bird
who
can
teach
me
what
she
will
.
Do
n't
I
listen
*NL*
to
her
willingly
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
Rosamond
it
seemed
as
if
she
and
Lydgate
were
as
good
as
engaged
.
*NL*
That
they
were
some
time
to
be
engaged
had
long
been
an
idea
in
her
*NL*
mind
;
and
ideas
,
we
know
,
tend
to
a
more
solid
kind
of
existence
,
the
*NL*
necessary
materials
being
at
hand
.
It
is
true
,
Lydgate
had
the
*NL*
counter-idea
of
remaining
unengaged
;
but
this
was
a
mere
negative
,
a
*NL*
shadow
cast
by
other
resolves
which
themselves
were
capable
of
*NL*
shrinking
.
Circumstance
was
almost
sure
to
be
on
the
side
of
*NL*
Rosamond
's
idea
,
which
had
a
shaping
activity
and
looked
through
*NL*
watchful
blue
eyes
,
whereas
Lydgate
's
lay
blind
and
unconcerned
as
a
*NL*
jelly-fish
which
gets
melted
without
knowing
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
evening
when
he
went
home
,
he
looked
at
his
phials
to
see
how
a
*NL*
process
of
maceration
was
going
on
,
with
undisturbed
interest
;
and
he
*NL*
wrote
out
his
daily
notes
with
as
much
precision
as
usual
.
The
*NL*
reveries
from
which
it
was
difficult
for
him
to
detach
himself
were
*NL*
ideal
constructions
of
something
else
than
Rosamond
's
virtues
,
and
the
*NL*
primitive
tissue
was
still
his
fair
unknown
.
Moreover
,
he
was
*NL*
beginning
to
feel
some
zest
for
the
growing
though
half-suppressed
feud
*NL*
between
him
and
the
other
medical
men
,
which
was
likely
to
become
more
*NL*
manifest
,
now
that
Bulstrode
's
method
of
managing
the
new
hospital
was
*NL*
about
to
be
declared
;
and
there
were
various
inspiriting
signs
that
his
*NL*
non-acceptance
by
some
of
Peacock
's
patients
might
be
counterbalanced
*NL*
by
the
impression
he
had
produced
in
other
quarters
.
Only
a
few
days
*NL*
later
,
when
he
had
happened
to
overtake
Rosamond
on
the
Lowick
road
and
*NL*
had
got
down
from
his
horse
to
walk
by
her
side
until
he
had
quite
*NL*
protected
her
from
a
passing
drove
,
he
had
been
stopped
by
a
servant
on
*NL*
horseback
with
a
message
calling
him
in
to
a
house
of
some
importance
*NL*
where
Peacock
had
never
attended
;
and
it
was
the
second
instance
of
*NL*
this
kind
.
The
servant
was
Sir
James
Chettam
's
,
and
the
house
was
*NL*
Lowick
Manor
.

CHAPTER

*NL*
*NL*
1st
Gent

All
times
are
good
to
seek
your
wedded
home
*NL*
Bringing
a
mutual
delight
.
*NL*
*NL*
2d
Gent
.
Why
,
true
.
*NL*
The
calendar
hath
not
an
evil
day
*NL*
For
souls
made
one
by
love
,
and
even
death
*NL*
Were
sweetness
,
if
it
came
like
rolling
waves
*NL*
While
they
two
clasped
each
other
,
and
foresaw
*NL*
No
life
apart
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Casaubon
,
returning
from
their
wedding
journey
,
arrived
at
*NL*
Lowick
Manor
in
the
middle
of
January
.
A
light
snow
was
falling
as
*NL*
they
descended
at
the
door
,
and
in
the
morning
,
when
Dorothea
passed
*NL*
from
her
dressing-room
avenue
the
blue-green
boudoir
that
we
know
of
,
*NL*
she
saw
the
long
avenue
of
limes
lifting
their
trunks
from
a
white
*NL*
earth
,
and
spreading
white
branches
against
the
dun
and
motionless
sky
.
*NL*
The
distant
flat
shrank
in
uniform
whiteness
and
low-hanging
uniformity
*NL*
of
cloud
.
The
very
furniture
in
the
room
seemed
to
have
shrunk
since
*NL*
she
saw
it
before
:
the
stag
in
the
tapestry
looked
more
like
a
ghost
in
*NL*
his
ghostly
blue-green
world
;
the
volumes
of
polite
literature
in
the
*NL*
bookcase
looked
more
like
immovable
imitations
of
books
.
The
bright
*NL*
fire
of
dry
oak-boughs
burning
on
the
logs
seemed
an
incongruous
*NL*
renewal
of
life
and
glow
--
like
the
figure
of
Dorothea
herself
as
she
*NL*
entered
carrying
the
red-leather
cases
containing
the
cameos
for
Celia
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
glowing
from
her
morning
toilet
as
only
healthful
youth
can
*NL*
glow
:
there
was
gem-like
brightness
on
her
coiled
hair
and
in
her
hazel
*NL*
eyes
;
there
was
warm
red
life
in
her
lips
;
her
throat
had
a
breathing
*NL*
whiteness
above
the
differing
white
of
the
fur
which
itself
seemed
to
*NL*
wind
about
her
neck
and
cling
down
her
blue-gray
pelisse
with
a
*NL*
tenderness
gathered
from
her
own
,
a
sentient
commingled
innocence
which
*NL*
kept
its
loveliness
against
the
crystalline
purity
of
the
outdoor
snow
.
*NL*
As
she
laid
the
cameo-cases
on
the
table
in
the
bow-window
,
she
*NL*
unconsciously
kept
her
hands
on
them
,
immediately
absorbed
in
looking
*NL*
out
on
the
still
,
white
enclosure
which
made
her
visible
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Casaubon
,
who
had
risen
early
complaining
of
palpitation
,
was
in
*NL*
the
library
giving
audience
to
his
curate
Mr.
Tucker
.
By-and-by
Celia
*NL*
would
come
in
her
quality
of
bridesmaid
as
well
as
sister
,
and
through
*NL*
the
next
weeks
there
would
be
wedding
visits
received
and
given
;
all
in
*NL*
continuance
of
that
transitional
life
understood
to
correspond
with
the
*NL*
excitement
of
bridal
felicity
,
and
keeping
up
the
sense
of
busy
*NL*
ineffectiveness
,
as
of
a
dream
which
the
dreamer
begins
to
suspect
.
*NL*
The
duties
of
her
married
life
,
contemplated
as
so
great
beforehand
,
*NL*
seemed
to
be
shrinking
with
the
furniture
and
the
white
vapor-walled
*NL*
landscape
.
The
clear
heights
where
she
expected
to
walk
in
full
*NL*
communion
had
become
difficult
to
see
even
in
her
imagination
;
the
*NL*
delicious
repose
of
the
soul
on
a
complete
superior
had
been
shaken
*NL*
into
uneasy
effort
and
alarmed
with
dim
presentiment
.
When
would
the
*NL*
days
begin
of
that
active
wifely
devotion
which
was
to
strengthen
her
*NL*
husband
's
life
and
exalt
her
own
?
Never
perhaps
,
as
she
had
*NL*
preconceived
them
;
but
somehow
--
still
somehow
.
In
this
solemnly
*NL*
pledged
union
of
her
life
,
duty
would
present
itself
in
some
new
form
*NL*
of
inspiration
and
give
a
new
meaning
to
wifely
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
there
was
the
snow
and
the
low
arch
of
dun
vapor
--
there
was
*NL*
the
stifling
oppression
of
that
gentlewoman
's
world
,
where
everything
*NL*
was
done
for
her
and
none
asked
for
her
aid
--
where
the
sense
of
*NL*
connection
with
a
manifold
pregnant
existence
had
to
be
kept
up
*NL*
painfully
as
an
inward
vision
,
instead
of
coming
from
without
in
claims
*NL*
that
would
have
shaped
her
energies
.
--
``
What
shall
I
do
?
''
``
Whatever
you
*NL*
please
,
my
dear
:
''
that
had
been
her
brief
history
since
she
had
left
*NL*
off
learning
morning
lessons
and
practising
silly
rhythms
on
the
hated
*NL*
piano
.
Marriage
,
which
was
to
bring
guidance
into
worthy
and
*NL*
imperative
occupation
,
had
not
yet
freed
her
from
the
gentlewoman
's
*NL*
oppressive
liberty
:
it
had
not
even
filled
her
leisure
with
the
*NL*
ruminant
joy
of
unchecked
tenderness
.
Her
blooming
full-pulsed
youth
*NL*
stood
there
in
a
moral
imprisonment
which
made
itself
one
with
the
*NL*
chill
,
colorless
,
narrowed
landscape
,
with
the
shrunken
furniture
,
the
*NL*
never-read
books
,
and
the
ghostly
stag
in
a
pale
fantastic
world
that
*NL*
seemed
to
be
vanishing
from
the
daylight
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
first
minutes
when
Dorothea
looked
out
she
felt
nothing
but
the
*NL*
dreary
oppression
;
then
came
a
keen
remembrance
,
and
turning
away
from
*NL*
the
window
she
walked
round
the
room
.
The
ideas
and
hopes
which
were
*NL*
living
in
her
mind
when
she
first
saw
this
room
nearly
three
months
*NL*
before
were
present
now
only
as
memories
:
she
judged
them
as
we
judge
*NL*
transient
and
departed
things
.
All
existence
seemed
to
beat
with
a
*NL*
lower
pulse
than
her
own
,
and
her
religious
faith
was
a
solitary
cry
,
*NL*
the
struggle
out
of
a
nightmare
in
which
every
object
was
withering
and
*NL*
shrinking
away
from
her
.
Each
remembered
thing
in
the
room
was
*NL*
disenchanted
,
was
deadened
as
an
unlit
transparency
,
till
her
wandering
*NL*
gaze
came
to
the
group
of
miniatures
,
and
there
at
last
she
saw
*NL*
something
which
had
gathered
new
breath
and
meaning
:
it
was
the
*NL*
miniature
of
Mr.
Casaubon
's
aunt
Julia
,
who
had
made
the
unfortunate
*NL*
marriage
--
of
Will
Ladislaw
's
grandmother
.
Dorothea
could
fancy
that
*NL*
it
was
alive
now
--
the
delicate
woman
's
face
which
yet
had
a
headstrong
*NL*
look
,
a
peculiarity
difficult
to
interpret
.
Was
it
only
her
friends
*NL*
who
thought
her
marriage
unfortunate
?
or
did
she
herself
find
it
out
to
*NL*
be
a
mistake
,
and
taste
the
salt
bitterness
of
her
tears
in
the
*NL*
merciful
silence
of
the
night
?
What
breadths
of
experience
Dorothea
*NL*
seemed
to
have
passed
over
since
she
first
looked
at
this
miniature
!
*NL*
She
felt
a
new
companionship
with
it
,
as
if
it
had
an
ear
for
her
and
*NL*
could
see
how
she
was
looking
at
it
.
Here
was
a
woman
who
had
known
*NL*
some
difficulty
about
marriage
.
Nay
,
the
colors
deepened
,
the
lips
and
*NL*
chin
seemed
to
get
larger
,
the
hair
and
eyes
seemed
to
be
sending
out
*NL*
light
,
the
face
was
masculine
and
beamed
on
her
with
that
full
gaze
*NL*
which
tells
her
on
whom
it
falls
that
she
is
too
interesting
for
the
*NL*
slightest
movement
of
her
eyelid
to
pass
unnoticed
and
uninterpreted
.
*NL*
The
vivid
presentation
came
like
a
pleasant
glow
to
Dorothea
:
she
felt
*NL*
herself
smiling
,
and
turning
from
the
miniature
sat
down
and
looked
up
*NL*
as
if
she
were
again
talking
to
a
figure
in
front
of
her
.
But
the
*NL*
smile
disappeared
as
she
went
on
meditating
,
and
at
last
she
said
*NL*
aloud
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it
was
cruel
to
speak
so
!
How
sad
--
how
dreadful
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
rose
quickly
and
went
out
of
the
room
,
hurrying
along
the
corridor
,
*NL*
with
the
irresistible
impulse
to
go
and
see
her
husband
and
inquire
if
*NL*
she
could
do
anything
for
him
.
Perhaps
Mr.
Tucker
was
gone
and
Mr.
*NL*
Casaubon
was
alone
in
the
library
.
She
felt
as
if
all
her
morning
's
*NL*
gloom
would
vanish
if
she
could
see
her
husband
glad
because
of
her
*NL*
presence
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
when
she
reached
the
head
of
the
dark
oak
there
was
Celia
coming
*NL*
up
,
and
below
there
was
Mr.
Brooke
,
exchanging
welcomes
and
*NL*
congratulations
with
Mr.
Casaubon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dodo
!
''
said
Celia
,
in
her
quiet
staccato
;
then
kissed
her
sister
,
*NL*
whose
arms
encircled
her
,
and
said
no
more
.
I
think
they
both
cried
a
*NL*
little
in
a
furtive
manner
,
while
Dorothea
ran
down-stairs
to
greet
her
*NL*
uncle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
need
not
ask
how
you
are
,
my
dear
,
''
said
Mr.
Brooke
,
after
kissing
*NL*
her
forehead
.
``
Rome
has
agreed
with
you
,
I
see
--
happiness
,
frescos
,
*NL*
the
antique
--
that
sort
of
thing
.
Well
,
it
's
very
pleasant
to
have
you
*NL*
back
again
,
and
you
understand
all
about
art
now
,
eh
?
But
Casaubon
is
*NL*
a
little
pale
,
I
tell
him
--
a
little
pale
,
you
know
.
Studying
hard
in
*NL*
his
holidays
is
carrying
it
rather
too
far
.
I
overdid
it
at
one
*NL*
time
''
--
Mr.
Brooke
still
held
Dorothea
's
hand
,
but
had
turned
his
face
*NL*
to
Mr.
Casaubon
--
``
about
topography
,
ruins
,
temples
--
I
thought
I
had
a
*NL*
clew
,
but
I
saw
it
would
carry
me
too
far
,
and
nothing
might
come
of
*NL*
it
.
You
may
go
any
length
in
that
sort
of
thing
,
and
nothing
may
come
*NL*
of
it
,
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
's
eyes
also
were
turned
up
to
her
husband
's
face
with
some
*NL*
anxiety
at
the
idea
that
those
who
saw
him
afresh
after
absence
might
*NL*
be
aware
of
signs
which
she
had
not
noticed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
to
alarm
you
,
my
dear
,
''
said
Mr.
Brooke
,
observing
her
*NL*
expression
.
``
A
little
English
beef
and
mutton
will
soon
make
a
*NL*
difference
.
It
was
all
very
well
to
look
pale
,
sitting
for
the
*NL*
portrait
of
Aquinas
,
you
know
--
we
got
your
letter
just
in
time
.
But
*NL*
Aquinas
,
now
--
he
was
a
little
too
subtle
,
was
n't
he
?
Does
anybody
read
*NL*
Aquinas
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
not
indeed
an
author
adapted
to
superficial
minds
,
''
said
Mr.
*NL*
Casaubon
,
meeting
these
timely
questions
with
dignified
patience
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
would
like
coffee
in
your
own
room
,
uncle
?
''
said
Dorothea
,
coming
*NL*
to
the
rescue
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
and
you
must
go
to
Celia
:
she
has
great
news
to
tell
you
,
you
*NL*
know
.
I
leave
it
all
to
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
blue-green
boudoir
looked
much
more
cheerful
when
Celia
was
seated
*NL*
there
in
a
pelisse
exactly
like
her
sister
's
,
surveying
the
cameos
with
*NL*
a
placid
satisfaction
,
while
the
conversation
passed
on
to
other
topics
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
it
nice
to
go
to
Rome
on
a
wedding
journey
?
''
said
Celia
,
*NL*
with
her
ready
delicate
blush
which
Dorothea
was
used
to
on
the
*NL*
smallest
occasions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
not
suit
all
--
not
you
,
dear
,
for
example
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
*NL*
quietly
.
No
one
would
ever
know
what
she
thought
of
a
wedding
journey
*NL*
to
Rome
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mrs.
Cadwallader
says
it
is
nonsense
,
people
going
a
long
journey
when
*NL*
they
are
married

She
says
they
get
tired
to
death
of
each
other
,
and
*NL*
ca
n't
quarrel
comfortably
,
as
they
would
at
home

And
Lady
Chettam
*NL*
says
she
went
to
Bath

''
Celia
's
color
changed
again
and
again
--
seemed
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
come
and
go
with
tidings
from
the
heart
,
*NL*
As
it
a
running
messenger
had
been
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
must
mean
more
than
Celia
's
blushing
usually
did
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Celia
!
has
something
happened
?
''
said
Dorothea
,
in
a
tone
full
of
*NL*
sisterly
feeling
.
``
Have
you
really
any
great
news
to
tell
me

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was

there
was
nobody

said
Celia
,
with
a
certain
roguishness
in
her
*NL*
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
understand

It
is

Dorothea
,
*NL*
taking
her
sister
's
face
between
her
hands
,
and
looking
at
her
half
*NL*
anxiously
.
Celia
's
marriage
seemed
more
serious
than
it
used
to
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
only
three

``
I
found
that

*NL*
*NL*
One
morning
,
some
weeks
after
her
arrival
at
Lowick
,
Dorothea
--
but
why
*NL*
always
Dorothea
?
Was
her
point
of
view
the
only
possible
one
with
*NL*
regard
to
this
marriage
?
I
protest
against
all
our
interest
,
all
our
*NL*
effort
at
understanding
being
given
to
the
young
skins
that
look
*NL*
blooming
in
spite
of
trouble
;
for
these
too
will
get
faded
,
and
will
*NL*
know
the
older
and
more
eating
griefs
which
we
are
helping
to
neglect
.
*NL*
In
spite
of
the
blinking
eyes
and
white
moles
objectionable
to
Celia
,
*NL*
and
the
want
of
muscular
curve
which
was
morally
painful
to
Sir
James
,
*NL*
Mr.
Casaubon
had
an
intense
consciousness
within
him
,
and
was
*NL*
spiritually
a-hungered
like
the
rest
of
us
.
He
had
done
nothing
*NL*
exceptional
in
marrying
--
nothing
but
what
society
sanctions
,
and
*NL*
considers
an
occasion
for
wreaths
and
bouquets
.
It
had
occurred
to
him
*NL*
that
he
must
not
any
longer
defer
his
intention
of
matrimony
,
and
he
*NL*
had
reflected
that
in
taking
a
wife
,
a
man
of
good
position
should
*NL*
expect
and
carefully
choose
a
blooming
young
lady
--
the
younger
the
*NL*
better
,
because
more
educable
and
submissive
--
of
a
rank
equal
to
his
*NL*
own
,
of
religious
principles
,
virtuous
disposition
,
and
good
*NL*
understanding
.
On
such
a
young
lady
he
would
make
handsome
*NL*
settlements
,
and
he
would
neglect
no
arrangement
for
her
happiness
:
in
*NL*
return
,
he
should
receive
family
pleasures
and
leave
behind
him
that
*NL*
copy
of
himself
which
seemed
so
urgently
required
of
a
man
--
to
the
*NL*
sonneteers
of
the
sixteenth
century
.
Times
had
altered
since
then
,
and
*NL*
no
sonneteer
had
insisted
on
Mr.
Casaubon
's
leaving
a
copy
of
himself
;
*NL*
moreover
,
he
had
not
yet
succeeded
in
issuing
copies
of
his
*NL*
mythological
key
;
but
he
had
always
intended
to
acquit
himself
by
*NL*
marriage
,
and
the
sense
that
he
was
fast
leaving
the
years
behind
him
,
*NL*
that
the
world
was
getting
dimmer
and
that
he
felt
lonely
,
was
a
reason
*NL*
to
him
for
losing
no
more
time
in
overtaking
domestic
delights
before
*NL*
they
too
were
left
behind
by
the
years
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
when
he
had
seen
Dorothea
he
believed
that
he
had
found
even
more
*NL*
than
he
demanded
:
she
might
really
be
such
a
helpmate
to
him
as
would
*NL*
enable
him
to
dispense
with
a
hired
secretary
,
an
aid
which
Mr.
*NL*
Casaubon
had
never
yet
employed
and
had
a
suspicious
dread
of
.
-LRB-
Mr.
*NL*
Casaubon
was
nervously
conscious
that
he
was
expected
to
manifest
a
*NL*
powerful
mind
.
-RRB-
Providence
,
in
its
kindness
,
had
supplied
him
with
the
*NL*
wife
he
needed
.
A
wife
,
a
modest
young
lady
,
with
the
purely
*NL*
appreciative
,
unambitious
abilities
of
her
sex
,
is
sure
to
think
her
*NL*
husband
's
mind
powerful
.
Whether
Providence
had
taken
equal
care
of
*NL*
Miss
Brooke
in
presenting
her
with
Mr.
Casaubon
was
an
idea
which
could
*NL*
hardly
occur
to
him
.
Society
never
made
the
preposterous
demand
that
a
*NL*
man
should
think
as
much
about
his
own
qualifications
for
making
a
*NL*
charming
girl
happy
as
he
thinks
of
hers
for
making
himself
happy
.
As
*NL*
if
a
man
could
choose
not
only
his
wife
but
his
wife
's
husband
!
Or
as
*NL*
if
he
were
bound
to
provide
charms
for
his
posterity
in
his
own
*NL*
person
!
--
When
Dorothea
accepted
him
with
effusion
,
that
was
only
*NL*
natural
;
and
Mr.
Casaubon
believed
that
his
happiness
was
going
to
*NL*
begin
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
not
had
much
foretaste
of
happiness
in
his
previous
life
.
To
*NL*
know
intense
joy
without
a
strong
bodily
frame
,
one
must
have
an
*NL*
enthusiastic
soul
.
Mr.
Casaubon
had
never
had
a
strong
bodily
frame
,
*NL*
and
his
soul
was
sensitive
without
being
enthusiastic
:
it
was
too
*NL*
languid
to
thrill
out
of
self-consciousness
into
passionate
delight
;
it
*NL*
went
on
fluttering
in
the
swampy
ground
where
it
was
hatched
,
thinking
*NL*
of
its
wings
and
never
flying
.
His
experience
was
of
that
pitiable
*NL*
kind
which
shrinks
from
pity
,
and
fears
most
of
all
that
it
should
be
*NL*
known
:
it
was
that
proud
narrow
sensitiveness
which
has
not
mass
enough
*NL*
to
spare
for
transformation
into
sympathy
,
and
quivers
thread-like
in
*NL*
small
currents
of
self-preoccupation
or
at
best
of
an
egoistic
*NL*
scrupulosity
.
And
Mr.
Casaubon
had
many
scruples
:
he
was
capable
of
a
*NL*
severe
self-restraint
;
he
was
resolute
in
being
a
man
of
honor
*NL*
according
to
the
code
;
he
would
be
unimpeachable
by
any
recognized
*NL*
opinion
.
In
conduct
these
ends
had
been
attained
;
but
the
difficulty
*NL*
of
making
his
Key
to
all
Mythologies
unimpeachable
weighed
like
lead
*NL*
upon
his
mind
;
and
the
pamphlets
--
or
``
Parerga
''
as
he
called
them
--
by
*NL*
which
he
tested
his
public
and
deposited
small
monumental
records
of
*NL*
his
march
,
were
far
from
having
been
seen
in
all
their
significance
.
*NL*
He
suspected
the
Archdeacon
of
not
having
read
them
;
he
was
in
painful
*NL*
doubt
as
to
what
was
really
thought
of
them
by
the
leading
minds
of
*NL*
Brasenose
,
and
bitterly
convinced
that
his
old
acquaintance
Carp
had
*NL*
been
the
writer
of
that
depreciatory
recension
which
was
kept
locked
in
*NL*
a
small
drawer
of
Mr.
Casaubon
's
desk
,
and
also
in
a
dark
closet
of
his
*NL*
verbal
memory
.
These
were
heavy
impressions
to
struggle
against
,
and
*NL*
brought
that
melancholy
embitterment
which
is
the
consequence
of
all
*NL*
excessive
claim
:
even
his
religious
faith
wavered
with
his
wavering
*NL*
trust
in
his
own
authorship
,
and
the
consolations
of
the
Christian
hope
*NL*
in
immortality
seemed
to
lean
on
the
immortality
of
the
still
unwritten
*NL*
Key
to
all
Mythologies
.
For
my
part
I
am
very
sorry
for
him
.
It
is
an
*NL*
uneasy
lot
at
best
,
to
be
what
we
call
highly
taught
and
yet
not
to
*NL*
enjoy
:
to
be
present
at
this
great
spectacle
of
life
and
never
to
be
*NL*
liberated
from
a
small
hungry
shivering
self
--
never
to
be
fully
*NL*
possessed
by
the
glory
we
behold
,
never
to
have
our
consciousness
*NL*
rapturously
transformed
into
the
vividness
of
a
thought
,
the
ardor
of
a
*NL*
passion
,
the
energy
of
an
action
,
but
always
to
be
scholarly
and
*NL*
uninspired
,
ambitious
and
timid
,
scrupulous
and
dim-sighted
.
Becoming
a
*NL*
dean
or
even
a
bishop
would
make
little
difference
,
I
fear
,
to
Mr.
*NL*
Casaubon
's
uneasiness
.
Doubtless
some
ancient
Greek
has
observed
that
*NL*
behind
the
big
mask
and
the
speaking-trumpet
,
there
must
always
be
our
*NL*
poor
little
eyes
peeping
as
usual
and
our
timorous
lips
more
or
less
*NL*
under
anxious
control
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
this
mental
estate
mapped
out
a
quarter
of
a
century
before
,
to
*NL*
sensibilities
thus
fenced
in
,
Mr.
Casaubon
had
thought
of
annexing
*NL*
happiness
with
a
lovely
young
bride
;
but
even
before
marriage
,
as
we
*NL*
have
seen
,
he
found
himself
under
a
new
depression
in
the
consciousness
*NL*
that
the
new
bliss
was
not
blissful
to
him
.
Inclination
yearned
back
*NL*
to
its
old
,
easier
custom
.
And
the
deeper
he
went
in
domesticity
the
*NL*
more
did
the
sense
of
acquitting
himself
and
acting
with
propriety
*NL*
predominate
over
any
other
satisfaction
.
Marriage
,
like
religion
and
*NL*
erudition
,
nay
,
like
authorship
itself
,
was
fated
to
become
an
outward
*NL*
requirement
,
and
Edward
Casaubon
was
bent
on
fulfilling
unimpeachably
*NL*
all
requirements
.
Even
drawing
Dorothea
into
use
in
his
study
,
*NL*
according
to
his
own
intention
before
marriage
,
was
an
effort
which
he
*NL*
was
always
tempted
to
defer
,
and
but
for
her
pleading
insistence
it
*NL*
might
never
have
begun
.
But
she
had
succeeded
in
making
it
a
matter
of
*NL*
course
that
she
should
take
her
place
at
an
early
hour
in
the
library
*NL*
and
have
work
either
of
reading
aloud
or
copying
assigned
her
.
The
*NL*
work
had
been
easier
to
define
because
Mr.
Casaubon
had
adopted
an
*NL*
immediate
intention
:
there
was
to
be
a
new
Parergon
,
a
small
monograph
*NL*
on
some
lately
traced
indications
concerning
the
Egyptian
mysteries
*NL*
whereby
certain
assertions
of
Warburton
's
could
be
corrected
.
*NL*
References
were
extensive
even
here
,
but
not
altogether
shoreless
;
and
*NL*
sentences
were
actually
to
be
written
in
the
shape
wherein
they
would
*NL*
be
scanned
by
Brasenose
and
a
less
formidable
posterity
.
These
minor
*NL*
monumental
productions
were
always
exciting
to
Mr.
Casaubon
;
digestion
*NL*
was
made
difficult
by
the
interference
of
citations
,
or
by
the
rivalry
*NL*
of
dialectical
phrases
ringing
against
each
other
in
his
brain
.
And
*NL*
from
the
first
there
was
to
be
a
Latin
dedication
about
which
*NL*
everything
was
uncertain
except
that
it
was
not
to
be
addressed
to
*NL*
Carp
:
it
was
a
poisonous
regret
to
Mr.
Casaubon
that
he
had
once
*NL*
addressed
a
dedication
to
Carp
in
which
he
had
numbered
that
member
of
*NL*
the
animal
kingdom
among
the
viros
nullo
aevo
perituros
,
a
mistake
*NL*
which
would
infallibly
lay
the
dedicator
open
to
ridicule
in
the
next
*NL*
age
,
and
might
even
be
chuckled
over
by
Pike
and
Tench
in
the
present
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
Mr.
Casaubon
was
in
one
of
his
busiest
epochs
,
and
as
I
began
to
*NL*
say
a
little
while
ago
,
Dorothea
joined
him
early
in
the
library
where
*NL*
he
had
breakfasted
alone
.
Celia
at
this
time
was
on
a
second
visit
to
*NL*
Lowick
,
probably
the
last
before
her
marriage
,
and
was
in
the
*NL*
drawing-room
expecting
Sir
James
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
had
learned
to
read
the
signs
of
her
husband
's
mood
,
and
she
*NL*
saw
that
the
morning
had
become
more
foggy
there
during
the
last
hour
.
*NL*
She
was
going
silently
to
her
desk
when
he
said
,
in
that
distant
tone
*NL*
which
implied
that
he
was
discharging
a
disagreeable
duty
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dorothea
,
here
is
a
letter
for
you
,
which
was
enclosed
in
one
*NL*
addressed
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
letter
of
two
pages
,
and
she
immediately
looked
at
the
*NL*
signature
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Ladislaw
!
What
can
he
have
to
say
to
me
?
''
she
exclaimed
,
in
a
*NL*
tone
of
pleased
surprise
.
``
But
,
''
she
added
,
looking
at
Mr.
Casaubon
,
*NL*
``
I
can
imagine
what
he
has
written
to
you
about
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
,
if
you
please
,
read
the
letter
,
''
said
Mr.
Casaubon
,
severely
*NL*
pointing
to
it
with
his
pen
,
and
not
looking
at
her
.
``
But
I
may
as
*NL*
well
say
beforehand
,
that
I
must
decline
the
proposal
it
contains
to
*NL*
pay
a
visit
here
.
I
trust
I
may
be
excused
for
desiring
an
interval
of
*NL*
complete
freedom
from
such
distractions
as
have
been
hitherto
*NL*
inevitable
,
and
especially
from
guests
whose
desultory
vivacity
makes
*NL*
their
presence
a
fatigue
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
had
been
no
clashing
of
temper
between
Dorothea
and
her
husband
*NL*
since
that
little
explosion
in
Rome
,
which
had
left
such
strong
traces
*NL*
in
her
mind
that
it
had
been
easier
ever
since
to
quell
emotion
than
to
*NL*
incur
the
consequence
of
venting
it
.
But
this
ill-tempered
*NL*
anticipation
that
she
could
desire
visits
which
might
be
disagreeable
*NL*
to
her
husband
,
this
gratuitous
defence
of
himself
against
selfish
*NL*
complaint
on
her
part
,
was
too
sharp
a
sting
to
be
meditated
on
until
*NL*
after
it
had
been
resented
.
Dorothea
had
thought
that
she
could
have
*NL*
been
patient
with
John
Milton
,
but
she
had
never
imagined
him
behaving
*NL*
in
this
way
;
and
for
a
moment
Mr.
Casaubon
seemed
to
be
stupidly
*NL*
undiscerning
and
odiously
unjust
.
Pity
,
that
``
new-born
babe
''
which
was
*NL*
by-and-by
to
rule
many
a
storm
within
her
,
did
not
``
stride
the
blast
''
*NL*
on
this
occasion
.
With
her
first
words
,
uttered
in
a
tone
that
shook
*NL*
him
,
she
startled
Mr.
Casaubon
into
looking
at
her
,
and
meeting
the
*NL*
flash
of
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
you
attribute
to
me
a
wish
for
anything
that
would
annoy
you
?
*NL*
You
speak
to
me
as
if
I
were
something
you
had
to
contend
against
.
*NL*
Wait
at
least
till
I
appear
to
consult
my
own
pleasure
apart
from
*NL*
yours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dorothea
,
you
are
hasty
,
''
answered
Mr.
Casaubon
,
nervously
.
*NL*
*NL*
Decidedly
,
this
woman
was
too
young
to
be
on
the
formidable
level
of
*NL*
wifehood
--
unless
she
had
been
pale
and
featureless
and
taken
*NL*
everything
for
granted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
it
was
you
who
were
first
hasty
in
your
false
suppositions
*NL*
about
my
feeling
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
in
the
same
tone
.
The
fire
was
not
*NL*
dissipated
yet
,
and
she
thought
it
was
ignoble
in
her
husband
not
to
*NL*
apologize
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
will
,
if
you
please
,
say
no
more
on
this
subject
,
Dorothea
.
I
have
*NL*
neither
leisure
nor
energy
for
this
kind
of
debate
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
Mr.
Casaubon
dipped
his
pen
and
made
as
if
he
would
return
to
his
*NL*
writing
,
though
his
hand
trembled
so
much
that
the
words
seemed
to
be
*NL*
written
in
an
unknown
character
.
There
are
answers
which
,
in
turning
*NL*
away
wrath
,
only
send
it
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
,
and
to
have
a
*NL*
discussion
coolly
waived
when
you
feel
that
justice
is
all
on
your
own
*NL*
side
is
even
more
exasperating
in
marriage
than
in
philosophy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
left
Ladislaw
's
two
letters
unread
on
her
husband
's
*NL*
writing-table
and
went
to
her
own
place
,
the
scorn
and
indignation
*NL*
within
her
rejecting
the
reading
of
these
letters
,
just
as
we
hurl
away
*NL*
any
trash
towards
which
we
seem
to
have
been
suspected
of
mean
*NL*
cupidity
.
She
did
not
in
the
least
divine
the
subtle
sources
of
her
*NL*
husband
's
bad
temper
about
these
letters
:
she
only
knew
that
they
had
*NL*
caused
him
to
offend
her
.
She
began
to
work
at
once
,
and
her
hand
did
*NL*
not
tremble
;
on
the
contrary
,
in
writing
out
the
quotations
which
had
*NL*
been
given
to
her
the
day
before
,
she
felt
that
she
was
forming
her
*NL*
letters
beautifully
,
and
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
saw
the
construction
*NL*
of
the
Latin
she
was
copying
,
and
which
she
was
beginning
to
*NL*
understand
,
more
clearly
than
usual
.
In
her
indignation
there
was
a
*NL*
sense
of
superiority
,
but
it
went
out
for
the
present
in
firmness
of
*NL*
stroke
,
and
did
not
compress
itself
into
an
inward
articulate
voice
*NL*
pronouncing
the
once
``
affable
archangel
''
a
poor
creature
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
had
been
this
apparent
quiet
for
half
an
hour
,
and
Dorothea
had
*NL*
not
looked
away
from
her
own
table
,
when
she
heard
the
loud
bang
of
a
*NL*
book
on
the
floor
,
and
turning
quickly
saw
Mr.
Casaubon
on
the
library
*NL*
steps
clinging
forward
as
if
he
were
in
some
bodily
distress
.
She
*NL*
started
up
and
bounded
towards
him
in
an
instant
:
he
was
evidently
in
*NL*
great
straits
for
breath
.
Jumping
on
a
stool
she
got
close
to
his
*NL*
elbow
and
said
with
her
whole
soul
melted
into
tender
alarm
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
you
lean
on
me
,
dear
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
still
for
two
or
three
minutes
,
which
seemed
endless
to
her
,
*NL*
unable
to
speak
or
move
,
gasping
for
breath
.
When
at
last
he
descended
*NL*
the
three
steps
and
fell
backward
in
the
large
chair
which
Dorothea
had
*NL*
drawn
close
to
the
foot
of
the
ladder
,
he
no
longer
gasped
but
seemed
*NL*
helpless
and
about
to
faint
.
Dorothea
rang
the
bell
violently
,
and
*NL*
presently
Mr.
Casaubon
was
helped
to
the
couch
:
he
did
not
faint
,
and
*NL*
was
gradually
reviving
,
when
Sir
James
Chettam
came
in
,
having
been
met
*NL*
in
the
hall
with
the
news
that
Mr.
Casaubon
had
``
had
a
fit
in
the
*NL*
library
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
God
!
this
is
just
what
might
have
been
expected
,
''
was
his
*NL*
immediate
thought
.
If
his
prophetic
soul
had
been
urged
to
*NL*
particularize
,
it
seemed
to
him
that
``
fits
''
would
have
been
the
*NL*
definite
expression
alighted
upon
.
He
asked
his
informant
,
the
butler
,
*NL*
whether
the
doctor
had
been
sent
for
.
The
butler
never
knew
his
master
*NL*
to
want
the
doctor
before
;
but
would
it
not
be
right
to
send
for
a
*NL*
physician
?
*NL*
*NL*
When
Sir
James
entered
the
library
,
however
,
Mr.
Casaubon
could
make
*NL*
some
signs
of
his
usual
politeness
,
and
Dorothea
,
who
in
the
reaction
*NL*
from
her
first
terror
had
been
kneeling
and
sobbing
by
his
side
now
*NL*
rose
and
herself
proposed
that
some
one
should
ride
off
for
a
medical
*NL*
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
recommend
you
to
send
for
Lydgate
,
''
said
Sir
James
.
``
My
mother
has
*NL*
called
him
in
,
and
she
has
found
him
uncommonly
clever
.
She
has
had
a
*NL*
poor
opinion
of
the
physicians
since
my
father
's
death
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
appealed
to
her
husband
,
and
he
made
a
silent
sign
of
*NL*
approval
.
So
Mr.
Lydgate
was
sent
for
and
he
came
wonderfully
soon
,
*NL*
for
the
messenger
,
who
was
Sir
James
Chettam
's
man
and
knew
Mr.
*NL*
Lydgate
,
met
him
leading
his
horse
along
the
Lowick
road
and
giving
his
*NL*
arm
to
Miss
Vincy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Celia
,
in
the
drawing-room
,
had
known
nothing
of
the
trouble
till
Sir
*NL*
James
told
her
of
it
.
After
Dorothea
's
account
,
he
no
longer
*NL*
considered
the
illness
a
fit
,
but
still
something
``
of
that
nature
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
dear
Dodo
--
how
dreadful
!
''
said
Celia
,
feeling
as
much
grieved
as
*NL*
her
own
perfect
happiness
would
allow
.
Her
little
hands
were
clasped
,
*NL*
and
enclosed
by
Sir
James
's
as
a
bud
is
enfolded
by
a
liberal
calyx
.
*NL*
``
It
is
very
shocking
that
Mr.
Casaubon
should
be
ill
;
but
I
never
did
*NL*
like
him
.
And
I
think
he
is
not
half
fond
enough
of
Dorothea
;
and
he
*NL*
ought
to
be
,
for
I
am
sure
no
one
else
would
have
had
him
--
do
you
*NL*
think
they
would
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
always
thought
it
a
horrible
sacrifice
of
your
sister
,
''
said
Sir
*NL*
James
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
But
poor
Dodo
never
did
do
what
other
people
do
,
and
I
think
she
*NL*
never
will
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
a
noble
creature
,
''
said
the
loyal-hearted
Sir
James
.
He
had
*NL*
just
had
a
fresh
impression
of
this
kind
,
as
he
had
seen
Dorothea
*NL*
stretching
her
tender
arm
under
her
husband
's
neck
and
looking
at
him
*NL*
with
unspeakable
sorrow
.
He
did
not
know
how
much
penitence
there
was
*NL*
in
the
sorrow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Celia
,
thinking
it
was
very
well
for
Sir
James
to
say
so
,
*NL*
but
_
he
_
would
not
have
been
comfortable
with
Dodo
.
``
Shall
I
go
to
*NL*
her
?
Could
I
help
her
,
do
you
think
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
it
would
be
well
for
you
just
to
go
and
see
her
before
Lydgate
*NL*
comes
,
''
said
Sir
James
,
magnanimously
.
``
Only
do
n't
stay
long
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
Celia
was
gone
he
walked
up
and
down
remembering
what
he
had
*NL*
originally
felt
about
Dorothea
's
engagement
,
and
feeling
a
revival
of
*NL*
his
disgust
at
Mr.
Brooke
's
indifference
.
If
Cadwallader
--
if
every
*NL*
one
else
had
regarded
the
affair
as
he
,
Sir
James
,
had
done
,
the
*NL*
marriage
might
have
been
hindered
.
It
was
wicked
to
let
a
young
girl
*NL*
blindly
decide
her
fate
in
that
way
,
without
any
effort
to
save
her
.
*NL*
Sir
James
had
long
ceased
to
have
any
regrets
on
his
own
account
:
his
*NL*
heart
was
satisfied
with
his
engagement
to
Celia
.
But
he
had
a
*NL*
chivalrous
nature
-LRB-
was
not
the
disinterested
service
of
woman
among
the
*NL*
ideal
glories
of
old
chivalry
?
-RRB-
:
his
disregarded
love
had
not
turned
to
*NL*
bitterness
;
its
death
had
made
sweet
odors
--
floating
memories
that
*NL*
clung
with
a
consecrating
effect
to
Dorothea
.
He
could
remain
her
*NL*
brotherly
friend
,
interpreting
her
actions
with
generous
trustfulness
.

CHAPTER
XXX

*NL*
``
Qui
veut
delasser
hors
de
propos
,
lasse
.
''
--
PASCAL
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Casaubon
had
no
second
attack
of
equal
severity
with
the
first
,
and
*NL*
in
a
few
days
began
to
recover
his
usual
condition
.
But
Lydgate
seemed
*NL*
to
think
the
case
worth
a
great
deal
of
attention
.
He
not
only
used
*NL*
his
stethoscope
-LRB-
which
had
not
become
a
matter
of
course
in
practice
at
*NL*
that
time
-RRB-
,
but
sat
quietly
by
his
patient
and
watched
him
.
To
Mr.
*NL*
Casaubon
's
questions
about
himself
,
he
replied
that
the
source
of
the
*NL*
illness
was
the
common
error
of
intellectual
men
--
a
too
eager
and
*NL*
monotonous
application
:
the
remedy
was
,
to
be
satisfied
with
moderate
*NL*
work
,
and
to
seek
variety
of
relaxation
.
Mr.
Brooke
,
who
sat
by
on
one
*NL*
occasion
,
suggested
that
Mr.
Casaubon
should
go
fishing
,
as
Cadwallader
*NL*
did
,
and
have
a
turning-room
,
make
toys
,
table-legs
,
and
that
kind
of
*NL*
thing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
short
,
you
recommend
me
to
anticipate
the
arrival
of
my
second
*NL*
childhood
,
''
said
poor
Mr.
Casaubon
,
with
some
bitterness
.
``
These
*NL*
things
,
''
he
added
,
looking
at
Lydgate
,
``
would
be
to
me
such
relaxation
*NL*
as
tow-picking
is
to
prisoners
in
a
house
of
correction
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
confess
,
''
said
Lydgate
,
smiling
,
``
amusement
is
rather
an
*NL*
unsatisfactory
prescription
.
It
is
something
like
telling
people
to
*NL*
keep
up
their
spirits
.
Perhaps
I
had
better
say
,
that
you
must
submit
*NL*
to
be
mildly
bored
rather
than
to
go
on
working
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
''
said
Mr.
Brooke
.
``
Get
Dorothea
to
play
backgammon
with
you
*NL*
in
the
evenings
.
And
shuttlecock
,
now
--
I
do
n't
know
a
finer
game
than
*NL*
shuttlecock
for
the
daytime
.
I
remember
it
all
the
fashion
.
To
be
*NL*
sure
,
your
eyes
might
not
stand
that
,
Casaubon
.
But
you
must
unbend
,
*NL*
you
know
.
Why
,
you
might
take
to
some
light
study
:
conchology
,
now
:
I
*NL*
always
think
that
must
be
a
light
study
.
Or
get
Dorothea
to
read
you
*NL*
light
things
,
Smollett
--
`
Roderick
Random
,
'
`
Humphrey
Clinker
:
'
they
*NL*
are
a
little
broad
,
but
she
may
read
anything
now
she
's
married
,
you
*NL*
know
.
I
remember
they
made
me
laugh
uncommonly
--
there
's
a
droll
bit
*NL*
about
a
postilion
's
breeches
.
We
have
no
such
humor
now
.
I
have
gone
*NL*
through
all
these
things
,
but
they
might
be
rather
new
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
new
as
eating
thistles
,
''
would
have
been
an
answer
to
represent
Mr.
*NL*
Casaubon
's
feelings
.
But
he
only
bowed
resignedly
,
with
due
respect
to
*NL*
his
wife
's
uncle
,
and
observed
that
doubtless
the
works
he
mentioned
*NL*
had
``
served
as
a
resource
to
a
certain
order
of
minds
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
''
said
the
able
magistrate
to
Lydgate
,
when
they
were
outside
*NL*
the
door
,
``
Casaubon
has
been
a
little
narrow
:
it
leaves
him
rather
at
a
*NL*
loss
when
you
forbid
him
his
particular
work
,
which
I
believe
is
*NL*
something
very
deep
indeed
--
in
the
line
of
research
,
you
know
.
I
would
*NL*
never
give
way
to
that
;
I
was
always
versatile
.
But
a
clergyman
is
*NL*
tied
a
little
tight
.
If
they
would
make
him
a
bishop
,
now
!
--
he
did
a
*NL*
very
good
pamphlet
for
Peel
.
He
would
have
more
movement
then
,
more
*NL*
show
;
he
might
get
a
little
flesh
.
But
I
recommend
you
to
talk
to
Mrs.
*NL*
Casaubon
.
She
is
clever
enough
for
anything
,
is
my
niece
.
Tell
her
,
*NL*
her
husband
wants
liveliness
,
diversion
:
put
her
on
amusing
tactics
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Without
Mr.
Brooke
's
advice
,
Lydgate
had
determined
on
speaking
to
*NL*
Dorothea
.
She
had
not
been
present
while
her
uncle
was
throwing
out
*NL*
his
pleasant
suggestions
as
to
the
mode
in
which
life
at
Lowick
might
*NL*
be
enlivened
,
but
she
was
usually
by
her
husband
's
side
,
and
the
*NL*
unaffected
signs
of
intense
anxiety
in
her
face
and
voice
about
*NL*
whatever
touched
his
mind
or
health
,
made
a
drama
which
Lydgate
was
*NL*
inclined
to
watch
.
He
said
to
himself
that
he
was
only
doing
right
in
*NL*
telling
her
the
truth
about
her
husband
's
probable
future
,
but
he
*NL*
certainly
thought
also
that
it
would
be
interesting
to
talk
*NL*
confidentially
with
her
.
A
medical
man
likes
to
make
psychological
*NL*
observations
,
and
sometimes
in
the
pursuit
of
such
studies
is
too
*NL*
easily
tempted
into
momentous
prophecy
which
life
and
death
easily
set
*NL*
at
nought
.
Lydgate
had
often
been
satirical
on
this
gratuitous
*NL*
prediction
,
and
he
meant
now
to
be
guarded
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
asked
for
Mrs.
Casaubon
,
but
being
told
that
she
was
out
walking
,
he
*NL*
was
going
away
,
when
Dorothea
and
Celia
appeared
,
both
glowing
from
*NL*
their
struggle
with
the
March
wind
.
When
Lydgate
begged
to
speak
with
*NL*
her
alone
,
Dorothea
opened
the
library
door
which
happened
to
be
the
*NL*
nearest
,
thinking
of
nothing
at
the
moment
but
what
he
might
have
to
*NL*
say
about
Mr.
Casaubon
.
It
was
the
first
time
she
had
entered
this
*NL*
room
since
her
husband
had
been
taken
ill
,
and
the
servant
had
chosen
*NL*
not
to
open
the
shutters
.
But
there
was
light
enough
to
read
by
from
*NL*
the
narrow
upper
panes
of
the
windows
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
not
mind
this
sombre
light
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
standing
in
the
*NL*
middle
of
the
room
.
``
Since
you
forbade
books
,
the
library
has
been
out
*NL*
of
the
question
.
But
Mr.
Casaubon
will
soon
be
here
again
,
I
hope
.
Is
*NL*
he
not
making
progress
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
much
more
rapid
progress
than
I
at
first
expected
.
Indeed
,
he
is
*NL*
already
nearly
in
his
usual
state
of
health
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
not
fear
that
the
illness
will
return
?
''
said
Dorothea
,
whose
*NL*
quick
ear
had
detected
some
significance
in
Lydgate
's
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Such
cases
are
peculiarly
difficult
to
pronounce
upon
,
''
said
Lydgate
.
*NL*
``
The
only
point
on
which
I
can
be
confident
is
that
it
will
be
*NL*
desirable
to
be
very
watchful
on
Mr.
Casaubon
's
account
,
lest
he
should
*NL*
in
any
way
strain
his
nervous
power
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beseech
you
to
speak
quite
plainly
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
in
an
imploring
*NL*
tone
.
``
I
can
not
bear
to
think
that
there
might
be
something
which
I
*NL*
did
not
know
,
and
which
,
if
I
had
known
it
,
would
have
made
me
act
*NL*
differently
.
''
The
words
came
out
like
a
cry
:
it
was
evident
that
they
*NL*
were
the
voice
of
some
mental
experience
which
lay
not
very
far
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sit
down
,
''
she
added
,
placing
herself
on
the
nearest
chair
,
and
*NL*
throwing
off
her
bonnet
and
gloves
,
with
an
instinctive
discarding
of
*NL*
formality
where
a
great
question
of
destiny
was
concerned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
you
say
now
justifies
my
own
view
,
''
said
Lydgate
.
``
I
think
it
is
*NL*
one
's
function
as
a
medical
man
to
hinder
regrets
of
that
sort
as
far
*NL*
as
possible
.
But
I
beg
you
to
observe
that
Mr.
Casaubon
's
case
is
*NL*
precisely
of
the
kind
in
which
the
issue
is
most
difficult
to
pronounce
*NL*
upon
.
He
may
possibly
live
for
fifteen
years
or
more
,
without
much
*NL*
worse
health
than
he
has
had
hitherto
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
had
turned
very
pale
,
and
when
Lydgate
paused
she
said
in
a
*NL*
low
voice
,
``
You
mean
if
we
are
very
careful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
careful
against
mental
agitation
of
all
kinds
,
and
against
*NL*
excessive
application
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
would
be
miserable
,
if
he
had
to
give
up
his
work
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
*NL*
with
a
quick
prevision
of
that
wretchedness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
aware
of
that
.
The
only
course
is
to
try
by
all
means
,
direct
*NL*
and
indirect
,
to
moderate
and
vary
his
occupations
.
With
a
happy
*NL*
concurrence
of
circumstances
,
there
is
,
as
I
said
,
no
immediate
danger
*NL*
from
that
affection
of
the
heart
,
which
I
believe
to
have
been
the
*NL*
cause
of
his
late
attack
.
On
the
other
hand
,
it
is
possible
that
the
*NL*
disease
may
develop
itself
more
rapidly
:
it
is
one
of
those
cases
in
*NL*
which
death
is
sometimes
sudden
.
Nothing
should
be
neglected
which
*NL*
might
be
affected
by
such
an
issue
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
silence
for
a
few
moments
,
while
Dorothea
sat
as
if
she
had
*NL*
been
turned
to
marble
,
though
the
life
within
her
was
so
intense
that
*NL*
her
mind
had
never
before
swept
in
brief
time
over
an
equal
range
of
*NL*
scenes
and
motives
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Help
me
,
pray
,
''
she
said
,
at
last
,
in
the
same
low
voice
as
before
.
*NL*
``
Tell
me
what
I
can
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
think
of
foreign
travel
?
You
have
been
lately
in
Rome
,
I
*NL*
think
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
memories
which
made
this
resource
utterly
hopeless
were
a
new
*NL*
current
that
shook
Dorothea
out
of
her
pallid
immobility
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
that
would
not
do
--
that
would
be
worse
than
anything
,
''
she
said
*NL*
with
a
more
childlike
despondency
,
while
the
tears
rolled
down
.
*NL*
``
Nothing
will
be
of
any
use
that
he
does
not
enjoy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
that
I
could
have
spared
you
this
pain
,
''
said
Lydgate
,
deeply
*NL*
touched
,
yet
wondering
about
her
marriage
.
Women
just
like
Dorothea
*NL*
had
not
entered
into
his
traditions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
right
of
you
to
tell
me
.
I
thank
you
for
telling
me
the
truth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
you
to
understand
that
I
shall
not
say
anything
to
enlighten
*NL*
Mr.
Casaubon
himself
.
I
think
it
desirable
for
him
to
know
nothing
*NL*
more
than
that
he
must
not
overwork
himself
,
and
must
observe
certain
*NL*
rules
.
Anxiety
of
any
kind
would
be
precisely
the
most
unfavorable
*NL*
condition
for
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lydgate
rose
,
and
Dorothea
mechanically
rose
at
the
same
time
,
*NL*
unclasping
her
cloak
and
throwing
it
off
as
if
it
stifled
her
.
He
was
*NL*
bowing
and
quitting
her
,
when
an
impulse
which
if
she
had
been
alone
*NL*
would
have
turned
into
a
prayer
,
made
her
say
with
a
sob
in
her
voice
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
are
a
wise
man
,
are
you
not
?
You
know
all
about
life
and
*NL*
death
.
Advise
me
.
Think
what
I
can
do
.
He
has
been
laboring
all
his
*NL*
life
and
looking
forward
.
He
minds
about
nothing
else
.
--
And
I
mind
*NL*
about
nothing
else
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
years
after
Lydgate
remembered
the
impression
produced
in
him
by
*NL*
this
involuntary
appeal
--
this
cry
from
soul
to
soul
,
without
other
*NL*
consciousness
than
their
moving
with
kindred
natures
in
the
same
*NL*
embroiled
medium
,
the
same
troublous
fitfully
illuminated
life
.
But
*NL*
what
could
he
say
now
except
that
he
should
see
Mr.
Casaubon
again
*NL*
to-morrow
?
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
was
gone
,
Dorothea
's
tears
gushed
forth
,
and
relieved
her
*NL*
stifling
oppression
.
Then
she
dried
her
eyes
,
reminded
that
her
*NL*
distress
must
not
be
betrayed
to
her
husband
;
and
looked
round
the
room
*NL*
thinking
that
she
must
order
the
servant
to
attend
to
it
as
usual
,
*NL*
since
Mr.
Casaubon
might
now
at
any
moment
wish
to
enter
.
On
his
*NL*
writing-table
there
were
letters
which
had
lain
untouched
since
the
*NL*
morning
when
he
was
taken
ill
,
and
among
them
,
as
Dorothea
well
*NL*
remembered
,
there
were
young
Ladislaw
's
letters
,
the
one
addressed
to
*NL*
her
still
unopened
.
The
associations
of
these
letters
had
been
made
*NL*
the
more
painful
by
that
sudden
attack
of
illness
which
she
felt
that
*NL*
the
agitation
caused
by
her
anger
might
have
helped
to
bring
on
:
it
*NL*
would
be
time
enough
to
read
them
when
they
were
again
thrust
upon
her
,
*NL*
and
she
had
had
no
inclination
to
fetch
them
from
the
library
.
But
now
*NL*
it
occurred
to
her
that
they
should
be
put
out
of
her
husband
's
sight
:
*NL*
whatever
might
have
been
the
sources
of
his
annoyance
about
them
,
he
*NL*
must
,
if
possible
,
not
be
annoyed
again
;
and
she
ran
her
eyes
first
*NL*
over
the
letter
addressed
to
him
to
assure
herself
whether
or
not
it
*NL*
would
be
necessary
to
write
in
order
to
hinder
the
offensive
visit
.
*NL*
*NL*
Will
wrote
from
Rome
,
and
began
by
saying
that
his
obligations
to
Mr.
*NL*
Casaubon
were
too
deep
for
all
thanks
not
to
seem
impertinent
.
It
was
*NL*
plain
that
if
he
were
not
grateful
,
he
must
be
the
poorest-spirited
*NL*
rascal
who
had
ever
found
a
generous
friend
.
To
expand
in
wordy
thanks
*NL*
would
be
like
saying
,
``
I
am
honest
.
''
But
Will
had
come
to
perceive
that
*NL*
his
defects
--
defects
which
Mr.
Casaubon
had
himself
often
pointed
*NL*
to
--
needed
for
their
correction
that
more
strenuous
position
which
his
*NL*
relative
's
generosity
had
hitherto
prevented
from
being
inevitable
.
He
*NL*
trusted
that
he
should
make
the
best
return
,
if
return
were
possible
,
*NL*
by
showing
the
effectiveness
of
the
education
for
which
he
was
*NL*
indebted
,
and
by
ceasing
in
future
to
need
any
diversion
towards
*NL*
himself
of
funds
on
which
others
might
have
a
better
claim
.
He
was
*NL*
coming
to
England
,
to
try
his
fortune
,
as
many
other
young
men
were
*NL*
obliged
to
do
whose
only
capital
was
in
their
brains
.
His
friend
*NL*
Naumann
had
desired
him
to
take
charge
of
the
``
Dispute
''
--
the
picture
*NL*
painted
for
Mr.
Casaubon
,
with
whose
permission
,
and
Mrs.
Casaubon
's
,
*NL*
Will
would
convey
it
to
Lowick
in
person
.
A
letter
addressed
to
the
*NL*
Poste
Restante
in
Paris
within
the
fortnight
would
hinder
him
,
if
*NL*
necessary
,
from
arriving
at
an
inconvenient
moment
.
He
enclosed
a
*NL*
letter
to
Mrs.
Casaubon
in
which
he
continued
a
discussion
about
art
,
*NL*
begun
with
her
in
Rome
.
*NL*
*NL*
Opening
her
own
letter
Dorothea
saw
that
it
was
a
lively
continuation
*NL*
of
his
remonstrance
with
her
fanatical
sympathy
and
her
want
of
sturdy
*NL*
neutral
delight
in
things
as
they
were
--
an
outpouring
of
his
young
*NL*
vivacity
which
it
was
impossible
to
read
just
now
.
She
had
immediately
*NL*
to
consider
what
was
to
be
done
about
the
other
letter
:
there
was
still
*NL*
time
perhaps
to
prevent
Will
from
coming
to
Lowick
.
Dorothea
ended
by
*NL*
giving
the
letter
to
her
uncle
,
who
was
still
in
the
house
,
and
begging
*NL*
him
to
let
Will
know
that
Mr.
Casaubon
had
been
ill
,
and
that
his
*NL*
health
would
not
allow
the
reception
of
any
visitors
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
one
more
ready
than
Mr.
Brooke
to
write
a
letter
:
his
only
*NL*
difficulty
was
to
write
a
short
one
,
and
his
ideas
in
this
case
*NL*
expanded
over
the
three
large
pages
and
the
inward
foldings
.
He
had
*NL*
simply
said
to
Dorothea
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
be
sure
,
I
will
write
,
my
dear
.
He
's
a
very
clever
young
*NL*
fellow
--
this
young
Ladislaw
--
I
dare
say
will
be
a
rising
young
man
.
*NL*
It
's
a
good
letter
--
marks
his
sense
of
things
,
you
know
.
However
,
I
*NL*
will
tell
him
about
Casaubon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
end
of
Mr.
Brooke
's
pen
was
a
thinking
organ
,
evolving
*NL*
sentences
,
especially
of
a
benevolent
kind
,
before
the
rest
of
his
mind
*NL*
could
well
overtake
them
.
It
expressed
regrets
and
proposed
remedies
,
*NL*
which
,
when
Mr.
Brooke
read
them
,
seemed
felicitously
*NL*
worded
--
surprisingly
the
right
thing
,
and
determined
a
sequel
which
he
*NL*
had
never
before
thought
of
.
In
this
case
,
his
pen
found
it
such
a
pity
*NL*
young
Ladislaw
should
not
have
come
into
the
neighborhood
just
at
*NL*
that
time
,
in
order
that
Mr.
Brooke
might
make
his
acquaintance
more
*NL*
fully
,
and
that
they
might
go
over
the
long-neglected
Italian
drawings
*NL*
together
--
it
also
felt
such
an
interest
in
a
young
man
who
was
starting
*NL*
in
life
with
a
stock
of
ideas
--
that
by
the
end
of
the
second
page
it
*NL*
had
persuaded
Mr.
Brooke
to
invite
young
Ladislaw
,
since
he
could
not
*NL*
be
received
at
Lowick
,
to
come
to
Tipton
Grange
.
Why
not
?
They
could
*NL*
find
a
great
many
things
to
do
together
,
and
this
was
a
period
of
*NL*
peculiar
growth
--
the
political
horizon
was
expanding
,
and
--
in
short
,
*NL*
Mr.
Brooke
's
pen
went
off
into
a
little
speech
which
it
had
lately
*NL*
reported
for
that
imperfectly
edited
organ
the
``
Middlemarch
Pioneer
.
''
*NL*
While
Mr.
Brooke
was
sealing
this
letter
,
he
felt
elated
with
an
influx
*NL*
of
dim
projects
:
--
a
young
man
capable
of
putting
ideas
into
form
,
the
*NL*
``
Pioneer
''
purchased
to
clear
the
pathway
for
a
new
candidate
,
documents
*NL*
utilized
--
who
knew
what
might
come
of
it
all
?
Since
Celia
was
going
to
*NL*
marry
immediately
,
it
would
be
very
pleasant
to
have
a
young
fellow
at
*NL*
table
with
him
,
at
least
for
a
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
went
away
without
telling
Dorothea
what
he
had
put
into
the
*NL*
letter
,
for
she
was
engaged
with
her
husband
,
and
--
in
fact
,
these
*NL*
things
were
of
no
importance
to
her
.

CHAPTER
XXXI
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
will
you
know
the
pitch
of
that
great
bell
*NL*
Too
large
for
you
to
stir
?
Let
but
a
flute
*NL*
Play
`
neath
the
fine-mixed
metal
listen
close
*NL*
Till
the
right
note
flows
forth
,
a
silvery
rill
.
*NL*
Then
shall
the
huge
bell
tremble
--
then
the
mass
*NL*
With
myriad
waves
concurrent
shall
respond
*NL*
In
low
soft
unison
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Lydgate
that
evening
spoke
to
Miss
Vincy
of
Mrs.
Casaubon
,
and
laid
*NL*
some
emphasis
on
the
strong
feeling
she
appeared
to
have
for
that
*NL*
formal
studious
man
thirty
years
older
than
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
she
is
devoted
to
her
husband
,
''
said
Rosamond
,
implying
a
*NL*
notion
of
necessary
sequence
which
the
scientific
man
regarded
as
the
*NL*
prettiest
possible
for
a
woman
;
but
she
was
thinking
at
the
same
time
*NL*
that
it
was
not
so
very
melancholy
to
be
mistress
of
Lowick
Manor
with
*NL*
a
husband
likely
to
die
soon
.
``
Do
you
think
her
very
handsome
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
certainly
is
handsome
,
but
I
have
not
thought
about
it
,
''
said
*NL*
Lydgate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
it
would
be
unprofessional
,
''
said
Rosamond
,
dimpling
.
``
But
*NL*
how
your
practice
is
spreading
!
You
were
called
in
before
to
the
*NL*
Chettams
,
I
think
;
and
now
,
the
Casaubons
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Lydgate
,
in
a
tone
of
compulsory
admission
.
``
But
I
do
n't
*NL*
really
like
attending
such
people
so
well
as
the
poor
.
The
cases
are
*NL*
more
monotonous
,
and
one
has
to
go
through
more
fuss
and
listen
more
*NL*
deferentially
to
nonsense
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
more
than
in
Middlemarch
,
''
said
Rosamond
.
``
And
at
least
you
go
*NL*
through
wide
corridors
and
have
the
scent
of
rose-leaves
everywhere
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
true
,
Mademoiselle
de
Montmorenci
,
''
said
Lydgate
,
just
bending
*NL*
his
head
to
the
table
and
lifting
with
his
fourth
finger
her
delicate
*NL*
handkerchief
which
lay
at
the
mouth
of
her
reticule
,
as
if
to
enjoy
its
*NL*
scent
,
while
he
looked
at
her
with
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
this
agreeable
holiday
freedom
with
which
Lydgate
hovered
about
the
*NL*
flower
of
Middlemarch
,
could
not
continue
indefinitely
.
It
was
not
*NL*
more
possible
to
find
social
isolation
in
that
town
than
elsewhere
,
and
*NL*
two
people
persistently
flirting
could
by
no
means
escape
from
``
the
*NL*
various
entanglements
,
weights
,
blows
,
clashings
,
motions
,
by
which
*NL*
things
severally
go
on
.
''
Whatever
Miss
Vincy
did
must
be
remarked
,
and
*NL*
she
was
perhaps
the
more
conspicuous
to
admirers
and
critics
because
*NL*
just
now
Mrs.
Vincy
,
after
some
struggle
,
had
gone
with
Fred
to
stay
a
*NL*
little
while
at
Stone
Court
,
there
being
no
other
way
of
at
once
*NL*
gratifying
old
Featherstone
and
keeping
watch
against
Mary
Garth
,
who
*NL*
appeared
a
less
tolerable
daughter-in-law
in
proportion
as
Fred
's
*NL*
illness
disappeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
Aunt
Bulstrode
,
for
example
,
came
a
little
oftener
into
Lowick
Gate
to
*NL*
see
Rosamond
,
now
she
was
alone
.
For
Mrs.
Bulstrode
had
a
true
*NL*
sisterly
feeling
for
her
brother
;
always
thinking
that
he
might
have
*NL*
married
better
,
but
wishing
well
to
the
children
.
Now
Mrs.
Bulstrode
*NL*
had
a
long-standing
intimacy
with
Mrs.
Plymdale
.
They
had
nearly
the
*NL*
same
preferences
in
silks
,
patterns
for
underclothing
,
china-ware
,
and
*NL*
clergymen
;
they
confided
their
little
troubles
of
health
and
household
*NL*
management
to
each
other
,
and
various
little
points
of
superiority
on
*NL*
Mrs.
Bulstrode
's
side
,
namely
,
more
decided
seriousness
,
more
*NL*
admiration
for
mind
,
and
a
house
outside
the
town
,
sometimes
served
to
*NL*
give
color
to
their
conversation
without
dividing
them
--
well-meaning
*NL*
women
both
,
knowing
very
little
of
their
own
motives
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Bulstrode
,
paying
a
morning
visit
to
Mrs.
Plymdale
,
happened
to
*NL*
say
that
she
could
not
stay
longer
,
because
she
was
going
to
see
poor
*NL*
Rosamond
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
you
say
`
poor
Rosamond
'
?
''
said
Mrs.
Plymdale
,
a
round-eyed
*NL*
sharp
little
woman
,
like
a
tamed
falcon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
so
pretty
,
and
has
been
brought
up
in
such
thoughtlessness
.
*NL*
The
mother
,
you
know
,
had
always
that
levity
about
her
,
which
makes
me
*NL*
anxious
for
the
children
.

*NL*

Well

Mrs.

,
with
*NL*
emphasis
,
``
I
must
say
,
anybody
would
suppose
you

Mr.
Bulstrode
*NL*

be
delighted
with

for
you

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
Mrs.

in
genuine
surprise

*NL*
*NL*
``
Not

what
I
am
truly
thankful

said
Mrs.
Plymdale
.
*NL*
``
He
could
certainly
better
afford
to
keep
such
a
wife

some
people
*NL*
can
;
but
I
should
wish
him
to
look
elsewhere

Still
a
mother
has
*NL*
anxieties
,
and
some
young
men
would
take
to
a
bad
life
in
consequence
.
*NL*
Besides
,
if
I
was
obliged
to
speak
,
I
should
say
I
was
not
fond

strangers
coming
into
a

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know

said
Mrs.
Bulstrode
,
with
a
little
emphasis
in
*NL*
her
turn
.
``
Mr.
Bulstrode
was
a
stranger
here
at
one

Abraham

were
strangers
in

we
are
told
to
entertain

strangers

And
especially
,

she
added
,
after
a
slight
pause
,
``
when
*NL*
they
are
unexceptionable

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
not
speaking

*NL*
*NL*
``
Selina

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

pride

Mrs.
Plymdale
,
who
had
never

given
all
her
confidence
to
*NL*
``
Harriet

on
this
subject

``
No
young
man
in
Middlemarch
was
good

enough
for
her
:
I
have
heard
her

say
as
much
.
That
is
not
a
*NL*
Christian
spirit
,
I
think
.
But
now
,
from
all
I
hear
,
she
has
found
a

man
as
proud
as
herself

*NL*
*NL*
``
You

that
there
is
anything

said
Mrs.
Bulstrode
,
rather
mortified
at
finding
out
her
own
*NL*
ignorance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it

*NL*
*NL*
``

I
go
about
so
little

am
sure

I
thought
,
at
one

is
a
little

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do

Mrs.

together
without

However
,
it

not

Shall
I
put
up
the
pattern

''
*NL*
*NL*
After
this
Mrs.
Bulstrode
drove
to
her
niece
with
a
mind
newly
*NL*
weighted
.
She
was
herself
handsomely
dressed
,
but
she
noticed
with
a
*NL*
little
more
regret
than
usual
that
Rosamond
,
who
was
just
come
in
and
*NL*
met
her
in
walking-dress
,
was
almost
as
expensively
equipped
.
Mrs.
*NL*
Bulstrode
was
a
feminine
smaller
edition
of
her
brother
,
and
had
none
*NL*
of
her
husband
's
low-toned
pallor
.
She
had
a
good
honest
glance
and
*NL*
used
no
circumlocution
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
alone
,
I
see
,
my
dear
,
''
she
said
,
as
they
entered
the
*NL*
drawing-room
together
,
looking
round
gravely
.
Rosamond
felt
sure
that
*NL*
her
aunt
had
something
particular
to
say
,
and
they
sat
down
near
each
*NL*
other
.
Nevertheless
,
the
quilling
inside
Rosamond
's
bonnet
was
so
*NL*
charming
that
it
was
impossible
not
to
desire
the
same
kind
of
thing
*NL*
for
Kate
,
and
Mrs.
Bulstrode
's
eyes
,
which
were
rather
fine
,
rolled
*NL*
round
that
ample
quilled
circuit
,
while
she
spoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
just
heard
something
about
you
that
has
surprised
me
very
much
,
*NL*
Rosamond
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
that
,
aunt
?
''
Rosamond
's
eyes
also
were
roaming
over
her
*NL*
aunt
's
large
embroidered
collar
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
hardly
believe
it
--
that
you
should
be
engaged
without
my
knowing
*NL*
it
--
without
your
father
's
telling
me
.
''
Here
Mrs.
Bulstrode
's
eyes
*NL*
finally
rested
on
Rosamond
's
,
who
blushed
deeply
,
and
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
engaged
,
aunt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
is
it
that
every
one
says
so
,
then
--
that
it
is
the
town
's
talk
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
town
's
talk
is
of
very
little
consequence
,
I
think
,
''
said
*NL*
Rosamond
,
inwardly
gratified
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
dear
,
be
more
thoughtful
;
do
n't
despise
your
neighbors
so
.
*NL*
Remember
you
are
turned
twenty-two
now
,
and
you
will
have
no
fortune
:
*NL*
your
father
,
I
am
sure
,
will
not
be
able
to
spare
you
anything
.
Mr.
*NL*
Lydgate
is
very
intellectual
and
clever
;
I
know
there
is
an
attraction
*NL*
in
that
.
I
like
talking
to
such
men
myself
;
and
your
uncle
finds
him
*NL*
very
useful
.
But
the
profession
is
a
poor
one
here
.
To
be
sure
,
this
*NL*
life
is
not
everything
;
but
it
is
seldom
a
medical
man
has
true
*NL*
religious
views
--
there
is
too
much
pride
of
intellect
.
And
you
are
not
*NL*
fit
to
marry
a
poor
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Lydgate
is
not
a
poor
man
,
aunt
.
He
has
very
high
connections
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
told
me
himself
he
was
poor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
because
he
is
used
to
people
who
have
a
high
style
of
living
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Rosamond
,
_
you
_
must
not
think
of
living
in
high
style
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Rosamond
looked
down
and
played
with
her
reticule
.
She
was
not
a
fiery
*NL*
young
lady
and
had
no
sharp
answers
,
but
she
meant
to
live
as
she
*NL*
pleased
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
it
is
really
true
?
''
said
Mrs.
Bulstrode
,
looking
very
earnestly
*NL*
at
her
niece
.
``
You
are
thinking
of
Mr.
Lydgate
--
there
is
some
*NL*
understanding
between
you
,
though
your
father
does
n't
know
.
Be
open
,
*NL*
my
dear
Rosamond
:
Mr.
Lydgate
has
really
made
you
an
offer
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Rosamond
's
feelings
were
very
unpleasant
.
She
had
been
quite
easy
*NL*
as
to
Lydgate
's
feeling
and
intention
,
but
now
when
her
aunt
put
this
*NL*
question
she
did
not
like
being
unable
to
say
Yes
.
Her
pride
was
hurt
,
*NL*
but
her
habitual
control
of
manner
helped
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pray
excuse
me
,
aunt
.
I
would
rather
not
speak
on
the
subject
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
would
not
give
your
heart
to
a
man
without
a
decided
prospect
,
I
*NL*
trust
,
my
dear
.
And
think
of
the
two
excellent
offers
I
know
of
that
*NL*
you
have
refused
!
--
and
one
still
within
your
reach
,
if
you
will
not
*NL*
throw
it
away
.
I
knew
a
very
great
beauty
who
married
badly
at
last
,
*NL*
by
doing
so
.
Mr.
Ned
Plymdale
is
a
nice
young
man
--
some
might
think
*NL*
good-looking
;
and
an
only
son
;
and
a
large
business
of
that
kind
is
*NL*
better
than
a
profession
.
Not
that
marrying
is
everything
.
I
would
*NL*
have
you
seek
first
the
kingdom
of
God
.
But
a
girl
should
keep
her
*NL*
heart
within
her
own
power
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
never
give
it
to
Mr.
Ned
Plymdale
,
if
it
were
.
I
have
*NL*
already
refused
him
.
If
I
loved
,
I
should
love
at
once
and
without
*NL*
change
,
''
said
Rosamond
,
with
a
great
sense
of
being
a
romantic
heroine
,
*NL*
and
playing
the
part
prettily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
how
it
is
,
my
dear
,
''
said
Mrs.
Bulstrode
,
in
a
melancholy
voice
,
*NL*
rising
to
go
.
``
You
have
allowed
your
affections
to
be
engaged
without
*NL*
return
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
indeed
,
aunt
,
''
said
Rosamond
,
with
emphasis
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
are
quite
confident
that
Mr.
Lydgate
has
a
serious
attachment
*NL*
to
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Rosamond
's
cheeks
by
this
time
were
persistently
burning
,
and
she
felt
*NL*
much
mortification
.
She
chose
to
be
silent
,
and
her
aunt
went
away
all
*NL*
the
more
convinced
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bulstrode
in
things
worldly
and
indifferent
was
disposed
to
do
what
*NL*
his
wife
bade
him
,
and
she
now
,
without
telling
her
reasons
,
desired
*NL*
him
on
the
next
opportunity
to
find
out
in
conversation
with
Mr.
*NL*
Lydgate
whether
he
had
any
intention
of
marrying
soon
.
The
result
was
*NL*
a
decided
negative
.
Mr.
Bulstrode
,
on
being
cross-questioned
,
showed
*NL*
that
Lydgate
had
spoken
as
no
man
would
who
had
any
attachment
that
*NL*
could
issue
in
matrimony
.
Mrs.
Bulstrode
now
felt
that
she
had
a
*NL*
serious
duty
before
her
,
and
she
soon
managed
to
arrange
a
tete-a-tete
*NL*
with
Lydgate
,
in
which
she
passed
from
inquiries
about
Fred
Vincy
's
*NL*
health
,
and
expressions
of
her
sincere
anxiety
for
her
brother
's
large
*NL*
family
,
to
general
remarks
on
the
dangers
which
lay
before
young
people
*NL*
with
regard
to
their
settlement
in
life
.
Young
men
were
often
wild
and
*NL*
disappointing
,
making
little
return
for
the
money
spent
on
them
,
and
a
*NL*
girl
was
exposed
to
many
circumstances
which
might
interfere
with
her
*NL*
prospects
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Especially
when
she
has
great
attractions
,
and
her
parents
see
much
*NL*
company
,
''
said
Mrs.
Bulstrode
``
Gentlemen
pay
her
attention
,
and
engross
*NL*
her
all
to
themselves
,
for
the
mere
pleasure
of
the
moment
,
and
that
*NL*
drives
off
others
.
I
think
it
is
a
heavy
responsibility
,
Mr.
Lydgate
,
*NL*
to
interfere
with
the
prospects
of
any
girl
.
''
Here
Mrs.
Bulstrode
fixed
*NL*
her
eyes
on
him
,
with
an
unmistakable
purpose
of
warning
,
if
not
of
*NL*
rebuke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Clearly
,
''
said
Lydgate
,
looking
at
her
--
perhaps
even
staring
a
little
*NL*
in
return
.
``
On
the
other
hand
,
a
man
must
be
a
great
coxcomb
to
go
*NL*
about
with
a
notion
that
he
must
not
pay
attention
to
a
young
lady
lest
*NL*
she
should
fall
in
love
with
him
,
or
lest
others
should
think
she
must
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Mr.
Lydgate
,
you
know
well
what
your
advantages
are
.
You
know
*NL*
that
our
young
men
here
can
not
cope
with
you
.
Where
you
frequent
a
*NL*
house
it
may
militate
very
much
against
a
girl
's
making
a
desirable
*NL*
settlement
in
life
,
and
prevent
her
from
accepting
offers
even
if
they
*NL*
are
made
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lydgate
was
less
flattered
by
his
advantage
over
the
Middlemarch
*NL*
Orlandos
than
he
was
annoyed
by
the
perception
of
Mrs.
Bulstrode
's
*NL*
meaning
.
She
felt
that
she
had
spoken
as
impressively
as
it
was
*NL*
necessary
to
do
,
and
that
in
using
the
superior
word
``
militate
''
she
had
*NL*
thrown
a
noble
drapery
over
a
mass
of
particulars
which
were
still
*NL*
evident
enough
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lydgate
was
fuming
a
little
,
pushed
his
hair
back
with
one
hand
,
felt
*NL*
curiously
in
his
waistcoat-pocket
with
the
other
,
and
then
stooped
to
*NL*
beckon
the
tiny
black
spaniel
,
which
had
the
insight
to
decline
his
*NL*
hollow
caresses
.
It
would
not
have
been
decent
to
go
away
,
because
he
*NL*
had
been
dining
with
other
guests
,
and
had
just
taken
tea
.
But
Mrs.
*NL*
Bulstrode
,
having
no
doubt
that
she
had
been
understood
,
turned
the
*NL*
conversation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Solomon
's
Proverbs
,
I
think
,
have
omitted
to
say
,
that
as
the
sore
*NL*
palate
findeth
grit
,
so
an
uneasy
consciousness
heareth
innuendoes
.
*NL*
The
next
day
Mr.
Farebrother
,
parting
from
Lydgate
in
the
street
,
*NL*
supposed
that
they
should
meet
at
Vincy
's
in
the
evening
.
Lydgate
*NL*
answered
curtly
,
no
--
he
had
work
to
do
--
he
must
give
up
going
out
in
*NL*
the
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
you
are
going
to
get
lashed
to
the
mast
,
eh
,
and
are
stopping
*NL*
your
ears
?
''
said
the
Vicar
.
``
Well
,
if
you
do
n't
mean
to
be
won
by
the
*NL*
sirens
,
you
are
right
to
take
precautions
in
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
days
before
,
Lydgate
would
have
taken
no
notice
of
these
words
as
*NL*
anything
more
than
the
Vicar
's
usual
way
of
putting
things
.
They
*NL*
seemed
now
to
convey
an
innuendo
which
confirmed
the
impression
that
he
*NL*
had
been
making
a
fool
of
himself
and
behaving
so
as
to
be
*NL*
misunderstood
:
not
,
he
believed
,
by
Rosamond
herself
;
she
,
he
felt
*NL*
sure
,
took
everything
as
lightly
as
he
intended
it
.
She
had
an
*NL*
exquisite
tact
and
insight
in
relation
to
all
points
of
manners
;
but
*NL*
the
people
she
lived
among
were
blunderers
and
busybodies
.
However
,
*NL*
the
mistake
should
go
no
farther
.
He
resolved
--
and
kept
his
*NL*
resolution
--
that
he
would
not
go
to
Mr.
Vincy
's
except
on
business
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rosamond
became
very
unhappy
.
The
uneasiness
first
stirred
by
her
*NL*
aunt
's
questions
grew
and
grew
till
at
the
end
of
ten
days
that
she
had
*NL*
not
seen
Lydgate
,
it
grew
into
terror
at
the
blank
that
might
possibly
*NL*
come
--
into
foreboding
of
that
ready
,
fatal
sponge
which
so
cheaply
*NL*
wipes
out
the
hopes
of
mortals
.
The
world
would
have
a
new
dreariness
*NL*
for
her
,
as
a
wilderness
that
a
magician
's
spells
had
turned
for
a
*NL*
little
while
into
a
garden
.
She
felt
that
she
was
beginning
to
know
*NL*
the
pang
of
disappointed
love
,
and
that
no
other
man
could
be
the
*NL*
occasion
of
such
delightful
aerial
building
as
she
had
been
enjoying
*NL*
for
the
last
six
months
.
Poor
Rosamond
lost
her
appetite
and
felt
as
*NL*
forlorn
as
Ariadne
--
as
a
charming
stage
Ariadne
left
behind
with
all
*NL*
her
boxes
full
of
costumes
and
no
hope
of
a
coach
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
are
many
wonderful
mixtures
in
the
world
which
are
all
alike
*NL*
called
love
,
and
claim
the
privileges
of
a
sublime
rage
which
is
an
*NL*
apology
for
everything
-LRB-
in
literature
and
the
drama
-RRB-
.
Happily
Rosamond
*NL*
did
not
think
of
committing
any
desperate
act
:
she
plaited
her
fair
*NL*
hair
as
beautifully
as
usual
,
and
kept
herself
proudly
calm
.
Her
most
*NL*
cheerful
supposition
was
that
her
aunt
Bulstrode
had
interfered
in
some
*NL*
way
to
hinder
Lydgate
's
visits
:
everything
was
better
than
a
*NL*
spontaneous
indifference
in
him
.
Any
one
who
imagines
ten
days
too
*NL*
short
a
time
--
not
for
falling
into
leanness
,
lightness
,
or
other
*NL*
measurable
effects
of
passion
,
but
--
for
the
whole
spiritual
circuit
of
*NL*
alarmed
conjecture
and
disappointment
,
is
ignorant
of
what
can
go
on
in
*NL*
the
elegant
leisure
of
a
young
lady
's
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
eleventh
day
,
however
,
Lydgate
when
leaving
Stone
Court
was
*NL*
requested
by
Mrs.
Vincy
to
let
her
husband
know
that
there
was
a
marked
*NL*
change
in
Mr.
Featherstone
's
health
,
and
that
she
wished
him
to
come
to
*NL*
Stone
Court
on
that
day
.
Now
Lydgate
might
have
called
at
the
*NL*
warehouse
,
or
might
have
written
a
message
on
a
leaf
of
his
pocket-book
*NL*
and
left
it
at
the
door
.
Yet
these
simple
devices
apparently
did
not
*NL*
occur
to
him
,
from
which
we
may
conclude
that
he
had
no
strong
*NL*
objection
to
calling
at
the
house
at
an
hour
when
Mr.
Vincy
was
not
at
*NL*
home
,
and
leaving
the
message
with
Miss
Vincy
.
A
man
may
,
from
various
*NL*
motives
,
decline
to
give
his
company
,
but
perhaps
not
even
a
sage
would
*NL*
be
gratified
that
nobody
missed
him
.
It
would
be
a
graceful
,
easy
way
*NL*
of
piecing
on
the
new
habits
to
the
old
,
to
have
a
few
playful
words
*NL*
with
Rosamond
about
his
resistance
to
dissipation
,
and
his
firm
resolve
*NL*
to
take
long
fasts
even
from
sweet
sounds
.
It
must
be
confessed
,
also
,
*NL*
that
momentary
speculations
as
to
all
the
possible
grounds
for
Mrs.
*NL*
Bulstrode
's
hints
had
managed
to
get
woven
like
slight
clinging
hairs
*NL*
into
the
more
substantial
web
of
his
thoughts
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Vincy
was
alone
,
and
blushed
so
deeply
when
Lydgate
came
in
that
*NL*
he
felt
a
corresponding
embarrassment
,
and
instead
of
any
playfulness
,
*NL*
he
began
at
once
to
speak
of
his
reason
for
calling
,
and
to
beg
her
,
*NL*
almost
formally
,
to
deliver
the
message
to
her
father
.
Rosamond
,
who
*NL*
at
the
first
moment
felt
as
if
her
happiness
were
returning
,
was
keenly
*NL*
hurt
by
Lydgate
's
manner
;
her
blush
had
departed
,
and
she
assented
*NL*
coldly
,
without
adding
an
unnecessary
word
,
some
trivial
chain-work
*NL*
which
she
had
in
her
hands
enabling
her
to
avoid
looking
at
Lydgate
*NL*
higher
than
his
chin
.
In
all
failures
,
the
beginning
is
certainly
the
*NL*
half
of
the
whole
.
After
sitting
two
long
moments
while
he
moved
his
*NL*
whip
and
could
say
nothing
,
Lydgate
rose
to
go
,
and
Rosamond
,
made
*NL*
nervous
by
her
struggle
between
mortification
and
the
wish
not
to
*NL*
betray
it
,
dropped
her
chain
as
if
startled
,
and
rose
too
,
*NL*
mechanically
.
Lydgate
instantaneously
stooped
to
pick
up
the
chain
.
*NL*
When
he
rose
he
was
very
near
to
a
lovely
little
face
set
on
a
fair
*NL*
long
neck
which
he
had
been
used
to
see
turning
about
under
the
most
*NL*
perfect
management
of
self-contented
grace
.
But
as
he
raised
his
eyes
*NL*
now
he
saw
a
certain
helpless
quivering
which
touched
him
quite
newly
,
*NL*
and
made
him
look
at
Rosamond
with
a
questioning
flash
.
At
this
moment
*NL*
she
was
as
natural
as
she
had
ever
been
when
she
was
five
years
old
:
*NL*
she
felt
that
her
tears
had
risen
,
and
it
was
no
use
to
try
to
do
*NL*
anything
else
than
let
them
stay
like
water
on
a
blue
flower
or
let
*NL*
them
fall
over
her
cheeks
,
even
as
they
would
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
moment
of
naturalness
was
the
crystallizing
feather-touch
:
it
*NL*
shook
flirtation
into
love
.
Remember
that
the
ambitious
man
who
was
*NL*
looking
at
those
Forget-me-nots
under
the
water
was
very
warm-hearted
*NL*
and
rash
.
He
did
not
know
where
the
chain
went
;
an
idea
had
thrilled
*NL*
through
the
recesses
within
him
which
had
a
miraculous
effect
in
*NL*
raising
the
power
of
passionate
love
lying
buried
there
in
no
sealed
*NL*
sepulchre
,
but
under
the
lightest
,
easily
pierced
mould
.
His
words
*NL*
were
quite
abrupt
and
awkward
;
but
the
tone
made
them
sound
like
an
*NL*
ardent
,
appealing
avowal
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
matter
?
you
are
distressed
.
Tell
me
,
pray
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Rosamond
had
never
been
spoken
to
in
such
tones
before
.
I
am
not
sure
*NL*
that
she
knew
what
the
words
were
:
but
she
looked
at
Lydgate
and
the
*NL*
tears
fell
over
her
cheeks
.
There
could
have
been
no
more
complete
*NL*
answer
than
that
silence
,
and
Lydgate
,
forgetting
everything
else
,
*NL*
completely
mastered
by
the
outrush
of
tenderness
at
the
sudden
belief
*NL*
that
this
sweet
young
creature
depended
on
him
for
her
joy
,
actually
*NL*
put
his
arms
round
her
,
folding
her
gently
and
protectingly
--
he
was
*NL*
used
to
being
gentle
with
the
weak
and
suffering
--
and
kissed
each
of
*NL*
the
two
large
tears
.
This
was
a
strange
way
of
arriving
at
an
*NL*
understanding
,
but
it
was
a
short
way
.
Rosamond
was
not
angry
,
but
she
*NL*
moved
backward
a
little
in
timid
happiness
,
and
Lydgate
could
now
sit
*NL*
near
her
and
speak
less
incompletely
.
Rosamond
had
to
make
her
little
*NL*
confession
,
and
he
poured
out
words
of
gratitude
and
tenderness
with
*NL*
impulsive
lavishment
.
In
half
an
hour
he
left
the
house
an
engaged
*NL*
man
,
whose
soul
was
not
his
own
,
but
the
woman
's
to
whom
he
had
bound
*NL*
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
came
again
in
the
evening
to
speak
with
Mr.
Vincy
,
who
,
just
*NL*
returned
from
Stone
Court
,
was
feeling
sure
that
it
would
not
be
long
*NL*
before
he
heard
of
Mr.
Featherstone
's
demise
.
The
felicitous
word
*NL*
``
demise
,
''
which
had
seasonably
occurred
to
him
,
had
raised
his
spirits
*NL*
even
above
their
usual
evening
pitch
.
The
right
word
is
always
a
*NL*
power
,
and
communicates
its
definiteness
to
our
action
.
Considered
as
*NL*
a
demise
,
old
Featherstone
's
death
assumed
a
merely
legal
aspect
,
so
*NL*
that
Mr.
Vincy
could
tap
his
snuff-box
over
it
and
be
jovial
,
without
*NL*
even
an
intermittent
affectation
of
solemnity
;
and
Mr.
Vincy
hated
both
*NL*
solemnity
and
affectation
.
Who
was
ever
awe
struck
about
a
testator
,
*NL*
or
sang
a
hymn
on
the
title
to
real
property
?
Mr.
Vincy
was
inclined
*NL*
to
take
a
jovial
view
of
all
things
that
evening
:
he
even
observed
to
*NL*
Lydgate
that
Fred
had
got
the
family
constitution
after
all
,
and
would
*NL*
soon
be
as
fine
a
fellow
as
ever
again
;
and
when
his
approbation
of
*NL*
Rosamond
's
engagement
was
asked
for
,
he
gave
it
with
astonishing
*NL*
facility
,
passing
at
once
to
general
remarks
on
the
desirableness
of
*NL*
matrimony
for
young
men
and
maidens
,
and
apparently
deducing
from
the
*NL*
whole
the
appropriateness
of
a
little
more
punch
.

SHAKESPEARE
:
Tempest
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
triumphant
confidence
of
the
Mayor
founded
on
Mr.
Featherstone
's
*NL*
insistent
demand
that
Fred
and
his
mother
should
not
leave
him
,
was
a
*NL*
feeble
emotion
compared
with
all
that
was
agitating
the
breasts
of
the
*NL*
old
man
's
blood-relations
,
who
naturally
manifested
more
their
sense
of
*NL*
the
family
tie
and
were
more
visibly
numerous
now
that
he
had
become
*NL*
bedridden
.
Naturally
:
for
when
``
poor
Peter
''
had
occupied
his
arm-chair
*NL*
in
the
wainscoted
parlor
,
no
assiduous
beetles
for
whom
the
cook
*NL*
prepares
boiling
water
could
have
been
less
welcome
on
a
hearth
which
*NL*
they
had
reasons
for
preferring
,
than
those
persons
whose
Featherstone
*NL*
blood
was
ill-nourished
,
not
from
penuriousness
on
their
part
,
but
from
*NL*
poverty
.
Brother
Solomon
and
Sister
Jane
were
rich
,
and
the
family
*NL*
candor
and
total
abstinence
from
false
politeness
with
which
they
were
*NL*
always
received
seemed
to
them
no
argument
that
their
brother
in
the
*NL*
solemn
act
of
making
his
will
would
overlook
the
superior
claims
of
*NL*
wealth
.
Themselves
at
least
he
had
never
been
unnatural
enough
to
*NL*
banish
from
his
house
,
and
it
seemed
hardly
eccentric
that
he
should
*NL*
have
kept
away
Brother
Jonah
,
Sister
Martha
,
and
the
rest
,
who
had
no
*NL*
shadow
of
such
claims
.
They
knew
Peter
's
maxim
,
that
money
was
a
good
*NL*
egg
,
and
should
be
laid
in
a
warm
nest
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Brother
Jonah
,
Sister
Martha
,
and
all
the
needy
exiles
,
held
a
*NL*
different
point
of
view
.
Probabilities
are
as
various
as
the
faces
to
*NL*
be
seen
at
will
in
fretwork
or
paper-hangings
:
every
form
is
there
,
*NL*
from
Jupiter
to
Judy
,
if
you
only
look
with
creative
inclination
.
To
*NL*
the
poorer
and
least
favored
it
seemed
likely
that
since
Peter
had
done
*NL*
nothing
for
them
in
his
life
,
he
would
remember
them
at
the
last
.
*NL*
Jonah
argued
that
men
liked
to
make
a
surprise
of
their
wills
,
while
*NL*
Martha
said
that
nobody
need
be
surprised
if
he
left
the
best
part
of
*NL*
his
money
to
those
who
least
expected
it
.
Also
it
was
not
to
be
*NL*
thought
but
that
an
own
brother
``
lying
there
''
with
dropsy
in
his
legs
*NL*
must
come
to
feel
that
blood
was
thicker
than
water
,
and
if
he
did
n't
*NL*
alter
his
will
,
he
might
have
money
by
him
.
At
any
rate
some
*NL*
blood-relations
should
be
on
the
premises
and
on
the
watch
against
*NL*
those
who
were
hardly
relations
at
all
.
Such
things
had
been
known
as
*NL*
forged
wills
and
disputed
wills
,
which
seemed
to
have
the
golden-hazy
*NL*
advantage
of
somehow
enabling
non-legatees
to
live
out
of
them
.
Again
,
*NL*
those
who
were
no
blood-relations
might
be
caught
making
away
with
*NL*
things
--
and
poor
Peter
``
lying
there
''
helpless
!
Somebody
should
be
on
*NL*
the
watch
.
But
in
this
conclusion
they
were
at
one
with
Solomon
and
*NL*
Jane
;
also
,
some
nephews
,
nieces
,
and
cousins
,
arguing
with
still
*NL*
greater
subtilty
as
to
what
might
be
done
by
a
man
able
to
``
will
away
''
*NL*
his
property
and
give
himself
large
treats
of
oddity
,
felt
in
a
*NL*
handsome
sort
of
way
that
there
was
a
family
interest
to
be
attended
*NL*
to
,
and
thought
of
Stone
Court
as
a
place
which
it
would
be
nothing
but
*NL*
right
for
them
to
visit
.
Sister
Martha
,
otherwise
Mrs.
Cranch
,
living
*NL*
with
some
wheeziness
in
the
Chalky
Flats
,
could
not
undertake
the
*NL*
journey
;
but
her
son
,
as
being
poor
Peter
's
own
nephew
,
could
represent
*NL*
her
advantageously
,
and
watch
lest
his
uncle
Jonah
should
make
an
*NL*
unfair
use
of
the
improbable
things
which
seemed
likely
to
happen
.
In
*NL*
fact
there
was
a
general
sense
running
in
the
Featherstone
blood
that
*NL*
everybody
must
watch
everybody
else
,
and
that
it
would
be
well
for
*NL*
everybody
else
to
reflect
that
the
Almighty
was
watching
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
Stone
Court
continually
saw
one
or
other
blood-relation
alighting
*NL*
or
departing
,
and
Mary
Garth
had
the
unpleasant
task
of
carrying
their
*NL*
messages
to
Mr.
Featherstone
,
who
would
see
none
of
them
,
and
sent
her
*NL*
down
with
the
still
more
unpleasant
task
of
telling
them
so
.
As
*NL*
manager
of
the
household
she
felt
bound
to
ask
them
in
good
provincial
*NL*
fashion
to
stay
and
eat
;
but
she
chose
to
consult
Mrs.
Vincy
on
the
*NL*
point
of
extra
down-stairs
consumption
now
that
Mr.
Featherstone
was
*NL*
laid
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
dear
,
you
must
do
things
handsomely
where
there
's
last
illness
*NL*
and
a
property
.
God
knows
,
I
do
n't
grudge
them
every
ham
in
the
*NL*
house
--
only
,
save
the
best
for
the
funeral
.
Have
some
stuffed
veal
*NL*
always
,
and
a
fine
cheese
in
cut
.
You
must
expect
to
keep
open
house
*NL*
in
these
last
illnesses
,
''
said
liberal
Mrs.
Vincy
,
once
more
of
*NL*
cheerful
note
and
bright
plumage
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
some
of
the
visitors
alighted
and
did
not
depart
after
the

and

Brother
Jonah
,
for
example
-LRB-
there
are
such
*NL*
unpleasant
people
in
most
families
;
perhaps
even
in
the
highest
*NL*
aristocracy
there
are
Brobdingnag
specimens
,
gigantically
in
debt
and
*NL*
bloated
at
greater
expense
-RRB-
--
Brother
Jonah
,
I
say
,
having
come
down
in
*NL*
the
world
,
was
mainly
supported
by
a
calling
which
he
was
modest
enough
*NL*
not
to
boast
of
,
though
it
was
much
better
than
swindling
either
on
*NL*
exchange
or
turf
,
but
which
did
not
require
his
presence
at
Brassing
so
*NL*
long
as
he
had
a
good
corner
to
sit
in
and
a
supply
of
food
.
He
chose
*NL*
the
kitchen-corner
,
partly
because
he
liked
it
best
,
and
partly
because
*NL*
he
did
not
want
to
sit
with
Solomon
,
concerning
whom
he
had
a
strong
*NL*
brotherly
opinion
.
Seated
in
a
famous
arm-chair
and
in
his
best
suit
,
*NL*
constantly
within
sight
of
good
cheer
,
he
had
a
comfortable
*NL*
consciousness
of
being
on
the
premises
,
mingled
with
fleeting
*NL*
suggestions
of
Sunday
and
the
bar
at
the
Green
Man
;
and
he
informed
*NL*
Mary
Garth
that
he
should
not
go
out
of
reach
of
his
brother
Peter
*NL*
while
that
poor
fellow
was
above
ground
.
The
troublesome
ones
in
a
*NL*
family
are
usually
either
the
wits
or
the
idiots
.
Jonah
was
the
wit
*NL*
among
the
Featherstones
,
and
joked
with
the
maid-servants
when
they
*NL*
came
about
the
hearth
,
but
seemed
to
consider
Miss
Garth
a
suspicious
*NL*
character
,
and
followed
her
with
cold
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
would
have
borne
this
one
pair
of
eyes
with
comparative
ease
,
but
*NL*
unfortunately
there
was
young
Cranch
,
who
,
having
come
all
the
way
from
*NL*
the
Chalky
Flats
to
represent
his
mother
and
watch
his
uncle
Jonah
,
*NL*
also
felt
it
his
duty
to
stay
and
to
sit
chiefly
in
the
kitchen
to
give
*NL*
his
uncle
company
.
Young
Cranch
was
not
exactly
the
balancing
point
*NL*
between
the
wit
and
the
idiot
,
--
verging
slightly
towards
the
latter
*NL*
type
,
and
squinting
so
as
to
leave
everything
in
doubt
about
his
*NL*
sentiments
except
that
they
were
not
of
a
forcible
character
.
When
*NL*
Mary
Garth
entered
the
kitchen
and
Mr.
Jonah
Featherstone
began
to
*NL*
follow
her
with
his
cold
detective
eyes
,
young
Cranch
turning
his
head
*NL*
in
the
same
direction
seemed
to
insist
on
it
that
she
should
remark
how
*NL*
he
was
squinting
,
as
if
he
did
it
with
design
,
like
the
gypsies
when
*NL*
Borrow
read
the
New
Testament
to
them
.
This
was
rather
too
much
for
*NL*
poor
Mary
;
sometimes
it
made
her
bilious
,
sometimes
it
upset
her
*NL*
gravity
.
One
day
that
she
had
an
opportunity
she
could
not
resist
*NL*
describing
the
kitchen
scene
to
Fred
,
who
would
not
be
hindered
from
*NL*
immediately
going
to
see
it
,
affecting
simply
to
pass
through
.
But
no
*NL*
sooner
did
he
face
the
four
eyes
than
he
had
to
rush
through
the
*NL*
nearest
door
which
happened
to
lead
to
the
dairy
,
and
there
under
the
*NL*
high
roof
and
among
the
pans
he
gave
way
to
laughter
which
made
a
*NL*
hollow
resonance
perfectly
audible
in
the
kitchen
.
He
fled
by
another
*NL*
doorway
,
but
Mr.
Jonah
,
who
had
not
before
seen
Fred
's
white
*NL*
complexion
,
long
legs
,
and
pinched
delicacy
of
face
,
prepared
many
*NL*
sarcasms
in
which
these
points
of
appearance
were
wittily
combined
with
*NL*
the
lowest
moral
attributes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
Tom
,
_
you
_
do
n't
wear
such
gentlemanly
trousers
--
you
have
n't
got
*NL*
half
such
fine
long
legs
,
''
said
Jonah
to
his
nephew
,
winking
at
the
*NL*
same
time
,
to
imply
that
there
was
something
more
in
these
statements
*NL*
than
their
undeniableness
.
Tom
looked
at
his
legs
,
but
left
it
*NL*
uncertain
whether
he
preferred
his
moral
advantages
to
a
more
vicious
*NL*
length
of
limb
and
reprehensible
gentility
of
trouser
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
large
wainscoted
parlor
too
there
were
constantly
pairs
of
eyes
*NL*
on
the
watch
,
and
own
relatives
eager
to
be
``
sitters-up
.
''
Many
came
,
*NL*
lunched
,
and
departed
,
but
Brother
Solomon
and
the
lady
who
had
been
*NL*
Jane
Featherstone
for
twenty-five
years
before
she
was
Mrs.
Waule
found
*NL*
it
good
to
be
there
every
day
for
hours
,
without
other
calculable
*NL*
occupation
than
that
of
observing
the
cunning
Mary
Garth
-LRB-
who
was
so
*NL*
deep
that
she
could
be
found
out
in
nothing
-RRB-
and
giving
occasional
dry
*NL*
wrinkly
indications
of
crying
--
as
if
capable
of
torrents
in
a
wetter
*NL*
season
--
at
the
thought
that
they
were
not
allowed
to
go
into
Mr.
*NL*
Featherstone
's
room
.
For
the
old
man
's
dislike
of
his
own
family
*NL*
seemed
to
get
stronger
as
he
got
less
able
to
amuse
himself
by
saying
*NL*
biting
things
to
them
.
Too
languid
to
sting
,
he
had
the
more
venom
*NL*
refluent
in
his
blood
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
fully
believing
the
message
sent
through
Mary
Garth
,
they
had
*NL*
presented
themselves
together
within
the
door
of
the
bedroom
,
both
in
*NL*
black
--
Mrs.
Waule
having
a
white
handkerchief
partially
unfolded
in
her
*NL*
hand
--
and
both
with
faces
in
a
sort
of
half-mourning
purple
;
while
Mrs.
*NL*
Vincy
with
her
pink
cheeks
and
pink
ribbons
flying
was
actually
*NL*
administering
a
cordial
to
their
own
brother
,
and
the
*NL*
light-complexioned
Fred
,
his
short
hair
curling
as
might
be
expected
in
*NL*
a
gambler
's
,
was
lolling
at
his
ease
in
a
large
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
Old
Featherstone
no
sooner
caught
sight
of
these
funereal
figures
*NL*
appearing
in
spite
of
his
orders
than
rage
came
to
strengthen
him
more
*NL*
successfully
than
the
cordial
.
He
was
propped
up
on
a
bed-rest
,
and
*NL*
always
had
his
gold-headed
stick
lying
by
him
.
He
seized
it
now
and
*NL*
swept
it
backwards
and
forwards
in
as
large
an
area
as
he
could
,
*NL*
apparently
to
ban
these
ugly
spectres
,
crying
in
a
hoarse
sort
of
*NL*
screech
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Back
,
back
,
Mrs.
Waule
!
Back
,
Solomon
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Brother
.
Peter
,
''
Mrs.
Waule
began
--
but
Solomon
put
his
hand
*NL*
before
her
repressingly
.
He
was
a
large-cheeked
man
,
nearly
seventy
,
*NL*
with
small
furtive
eyes
,
and
was
not
only
of
much
blander
temper
but
*NL*
thought
himself
much
deeper
than
his
brother
Peter
;
indeed
not
likely
*NL*
to
be
deceived
in
any
of
his
fellow-men
,
inasmuch
as
they
could
not
*NL*
well
be
more
greedy
and
deceitful
than
he
suspected
them
of
being
.
*NL*
Even
the
invisible
powers
,
he
thought
,
were
likely
to
be
soothed
by
a
*NL*
bland
parenthesis
here
and
there
--
coming
from
a
man
of
property
,
who
*NL*
might
have
been
as
impious
as
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Brother
Peter
,
''
he
said
,
in
a
wheedling
yet
gravely
official
tone
,
*NL*
``
It
's
nothing
but
right
I
should
speak
to
you
about
the
Three
Crofts
*NL*
and
the
Manganese
.
The
Almighty
knows
what
I
've
got
on
my
mind
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
he
knows
more
than
I
want
to
know
,
''
said
Peter
,
laying
down
his
*NL*
stick
with
a
show
of
truce
which
had
a
threat
in
it
too
,
for
he
*NL*
reversed
the
stick
so
as
to
make
the
gold
handle
a
club
in
case
of
*NL*
closer
fighting
,
and
looked
hard
at
Solomon
's
bald
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
things
you
might
repent
of
,
Brother
,
for
want
of
speaking
to
*NL*
me
,
''
said
Solomon
,
not
advancing
,
however
.
``
I
could
sit
up
with
you
*NL*
to-night
,
and
Jane
with
me
,
willingly
,
and
you
might
take
your
own
time
*NL*
to
speak
,
or
let
me
speak
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
shall
take
my
own
time
--
you
need
n't
offer
me
yours
,
''
said
Peter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
ca
n't
take
your
own
time
to
die
in
,
Brother
,
''
began
Mrs.
*NL*
Waule
,
with
her
usual
woolly
tone
.
``
And
when
you
lie
speechless
you
*NL*
may
be
tired
of
having
strangers
about
you
,
and
you
may
think
of
me
and
*NL*
my
children
''
--
but
here
her
voice
broke
under
the
touching
thought
which
*NL*
she
was
attributing
to
her
speechless
brother
;
the
mention
of
ourselves
*NL*
being
naturally
affecting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
sha
n't
,
''
said
old
Featherstone
,
contradictiously
.
``
I
sha
n't
*NL*
think
of
any
of
you
.
I
've
made
my
will
,
I
tell
you
,
I
've
made
my
*NL*
will
.
''
Here
he
turned
his
head
towards
Mrs.
Vincy
,
and
swallowed
some
*NL*
more
of
his
cordial
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Some
people
would
be
ashamed
to
fill
up
a
place
belonging
by
rights
to
*NL*
others
,
''
said
Mrs.
Waule
,
turning
her
narrow
eyes
in
the
same
direction
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
sister
,
''
said
Solomon
,
with
ironical
softness
,
``
you
and
me
are
not
*NL*
fine
,
and
handsome
,
and
clever
enough
:
we
must
be
humble
and
let
smart
*NL*
people
push
themselves
before
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fred
's
spirit
could
not
bear
this
:
rising
and
looking
at
Mr.
*NL*
Featherstone
,
he
said
,
``
Shall
my
mother
and
I
leave
the
room
,
sir
,
that
*NL*
you
may
be
alone
with
your
friends
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sit
down
,
I
tell
you
,
''
said
old
Featherstone
,
snappishly
.
``
Stop
where
*NL*
you
are
.
Good-by
,
Solomon
,
''
he
added
,
trying
to
wield
his
stick
again
,
*NL*
but
failing
now
that
he
had
reversed
the
handle
.
``
Good-by
,
Mrs.
Waule
.
*NL*
Do
n't
you
come
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
be
down-stairs
,
Brother
,
whether
or
no
,
''
said
Solomon
.
``
I
*NL*
shall
do
my
duty
,
and
it
remains
to
be
seen
what
the
Almighty
will
*NL*
allow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
in
property
going
out
of
families
,
''
said
Mrs.
Waule
,
in
*NL*
continuation
,
--
``
and
where
there
's
steady
young
men
to
carry
on
.
But
I
*NL*
pity
them
who
are
not
such
,
and
I
pity
their
mothers
.
Good-by
,
Brother
*NL*
Peter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Remember
,
I
'm
the
eldest
after
you
,
Brother
,
and
prospered
from
the
*NL*
first
,
just
as
you
did
,
and
have
got
land
already
by
the
name
of
*NL*
Featherstone
,
''
said
Solomon
,
relying
much
on
that
reflection
,
as
one
*NL*
which
might
be
suggested
in
the
watches
of
the
night
.
``
But
I
bid
you
*NL*
good-by
for
the
present
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Their
exit
was
hastened
by
their
seeing
old
Mr.
Featherstone
pull
his
*NL*
wig
on
each
side
and
shut
his
eyes
with
his
mouth-widening
grimace
,
as
*NL*
if
he
were
determined
to
be
deaf
and
blind
.
*NL*
*NL*
None
the
less
they
came
to
Stone
Court
daily
and
sat
below
at
the
post
*NL*
of
duty
,
sometimes
carrying
on
a
slow
dialogue
in
an
undertone
in
which
*NL*
the
observation
and
response
were
so
far
apart
,
that
any
one
hearing
*NL*
them
might
have
imagined
himself
listening
to
speaking
automata
,
in
*NL*
some
doubt
whether
the
ingenious
mechanism
would
really
work
,
or
wind
*NL*
itself
up
for
a
long
time
in
order
to
stick
and
be
silent
.
Solomon
and
*NL*
Jane
would
have
been
sorry
to
be
quick
:
what
that
led
to
might
be
seen
*NL*
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
in
the
person
of
Brother
Jonah
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
their
watch
in
the
wainscoted
parlor
was
sometimes
varied
by
the
*NL*
presence
of
other
guests
from
far
or
near
.
Now
that
Peter
Featherstone
*NL*
was
up-stairs
,
his
property
could
be
discussed
with
all
that
local
*NL*
enlightenment
to
be
found
on
the
spot
:
some
rural
and
Middlemarch
*NL*
neighbors
expressed
much
agreement
with
the
family
and
sympathy
with
*NL*
their
interest
against
the
Vincys
,
and
feminine
visitors
were
even
*NL*
moved
to
tears
,
in
conversation
with
Mrs.
Waule
,
when
they
recalled
the
*NL*
fact
that
they
themselves
had
been
disappointed
in
times
past
by
*NL*
codicils
and
marriages
for
spite
on
the
part
of
ungrateful
elderly
*NL*
gentlemen
,
who
,
it
might
have
been
supposed
,
had
been
spared
for
*NL*
something
better
.
Such
conversation
paused
suddenly
,
like
an
organ
*NL*
when
the
bellows
are
let
drop
,
if
Mary
Garth
came
into
the
room
;
and
*NL*
all
eyes
were
turned
on
her
as
a
possible
legatee
,
or
one
who
might
get
*NL*
access
to
iron
chests
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
younger
men
who
were
relatives
or
connections
of
the
family
,
*NL*
were
disposed
to
admire
her
in
this
problematic
light
,
as
a
girl
who
*NL*
showed
much
conduct
,
and
who
among
all
the
chances
that
were
flying
*NL*
might
turn
out
to
be
at
least
a
moderate
prize
.
Hence
she
had
her
*NL*
share
of
compliments
and
polite
attentions
.
*NL*
*NL*
Especially
from
Mr.
Borthrop
Trumbull
,
a
distinguished
bachelor
and
*NL*
auctioneer
of
those
parts
,
much
concerned
in
the
sale
of
land
and
*NL*
cattle
:
a
public
character
,
indeed
,
whose
name
was
seen
on
widely
*NL*
distributed
placards
,
and
who
might
reasonably
be
sorry
for
those
who
*NL*
did
not
know
of
him
.
He
was
second
cousin
to
Peter
Featherstone
,
and
*NL*
had
been
treated
by
him
with
more
amenity
than
any
other
relative
,
*NL*
being
useful
in
matters
of
business
;
and
in
that
programme
of
his
*NL*
funeral
which
the
old
man
had
himself
dictated
,
he
had
been
named
as
a
*NL*
Bearer
.
There
was
no
odious
cupidity
in
Mr.
Borthrop
Trumbull
--
nothing
*NL*
more
than
a
sincere
sense
of
his
own
merit
,
which
,
he
was
aware
,
in
*NL*
case
of
rivalry
might
tell
against
competitors
;
so
that
if
Peter
*NL*
Featherstone
,
who
so
far
as
he
,
Trumbull
,
was
concerned
,
had
*NL*
behaved
like
as
good
a
soul
as
ever
breathed
,
should
have
done
anything
*NL*
handsome
by
him
,
all
he
could
say
was
,
that
he
had
never
fished
and
*NL*
fawned
,
but
had
advised
him
to
the
best
of
his
experience
,
which
now
*NL*
extended
over
twenty
years
from
the
time
of
his
apprenticeship
at
*NL*
fifteen
,
and
was
likely
to
yield
a
knowledge
of
no
surreptitious
kind
.
*NL*
His
admiration
was
far
from
being
confined
to
himself
,
but
was
*NL*
accustomed
professionally
as
well
as
privately
to
delight
in
estimating
*NL*
things
at
a
high
rate
.
He
was
an
amateur
of
superior
phrases
,
and
*NL*
never
used
poor
language
without
immediately
correcting
himself
--
which
*NL*
was
fortunate
,
as
he
was
rather
loud
,
and
given
to
predominate
,
*NL*
standing
or
walking
about
frequently
,
pulling
down
his
waistcoat
with
*NL*
the
air
of
a
man
who
is
very
much
of
his
own
opinion
,
trimming
himself
*NL*
rapidly
with
his
fore-finger
,
and
marking
each
new
series
in
these
*NL*
movements
by
a
busy
play
with
his
large
seals
.
There
was
occasionally
*NL*
a
little
fierceness
in
his
demeanor
,
but
it
was
directed
chiefly
*NL*
against
false
opinion
,
of
which
there
is
so
much
to
correct
in
the
*NL*
world
that
a
man
of
some
reading
and
experience
necessarily
has
his
*NL*
patience
tried
.
He
felt
that
the
Featherstone
family
generally
was
of
*NL*
limited
understanding
,
but
being
a
man
of
the
world
and
a
public
*NL*
character
,
took
everything
as
a
matter
of
course
,
and
even
went
to
*NL*
converse
with
Mr.
Jonah
and
young
Cranch
in
the
kitchen
,
not
doubting
*NL*
that
he
had
impressed
the
latter
greatly
by
his
leading
questions
*NL*
concerning
the
Chalky
Flats
.
If
anybody
had
observed
that
Mr.
Borthrop
*NL*
Trumbull
,
being
an
auctioneer
,
was
bound
to
know
the
nature
of
*NL*
everything
,
he
would
have
smiled
and
trimmed
himself
silently
with
the
*NL*
sense
that
he
came
pretty
near
that
.
On
the
whole
,
in
an
auctioneering
*NL*
way
,
he
was
an
honorable
man
,
not
ashamed
of
his
business
,
and
feeling
*NL*
that
``
the
celebrated
Peel
,
now
Sir
Robert
,
''
if
introduced
to
him
,
would
*NL*
not
fail
to
recognize
his
importance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
mind
if
I
have
a
slice
of
that
ham
,
and
a
glass
of
that
ale
,
*NL*
Miss
Garth
,
if
you
will
allow
me
,
''
he
said
,
coming
into
the
parlor
at
*NL*
half-past
eleven
,
after
having
had
the
exceptional
privilege
of
seeing
*NL*
old
Featherstone
,
and
standing
with
his
back
to
the
fire
between
Mrs.
*NL*
Waule
and
Solomon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
not
necessary
for
you
to
go
out
;
--
let
me
ring
the
bell
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
''
said
Mary
,
``
I
have
an
errand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Mr.
Trumbull
,
you
're
highly
favored
,
''
said
Mrs.
Waule
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
seeing
the
old
man
?
''
said
the
auctioneer
,
playing
with
his
seals
*NL*
dispassionately
.
``
Ah
,
you
see
he
has
relied
on
me
considerably
.
''
Here
*NL*
he
pressed
his
lips
together
,
and
frowned
meditatively
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Might
anybody
ask
what
their
brother
has
been
saying
?
''
said
Solomon
,
*NL*
in
a
soft
tone
of
humility
,
in
which
he
had
a
sense
of
luxurious
*NL*
cunning
,
he
being
a
rich
man
and
not
in
need
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
,
anybody
may
ask
,
''
said
Mr.
Trumbull
,
with
loud
and
*NL*
good-humored
though
cutting
sarcasm
.
``
Anybody
may
interrogate
.
Any
*NL*
one
may
give
their
remarks
an
interrogative
turn
,
''
he
continued
,
his
*NL*
sonorousness
rising
with
his
style
.
``
This
is
constantly
done
by
good
*NL*
speakers
,
even
when
they
anticipate
no
answer
.
It
is
what
we
call
a
*NL*
figure
of
speech
--
speech
at
a
high
figure
,
as
one
may
say
.
''
The
*NL*
eloquent
auctioneer
smiled
at
his
own
ingenuity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
n't
be
sorry
to
hear
he
'd
remembered
you
,
Mr.
Trumbull
,
''
said
*NL*
Solomon
.
``
I
never
was
against
the
deserving
.
It
's
the
undeserving
I
'm
*NL*
against
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
there
it
is
,
you
see
,
there
it
is
,
''
said
Mr.
Trumbull
,
*NL*
significantly
.
``
It
ca
n't
be
denied
that
undeserving
people
have
been
*NL*
legatees
,
and
even
residuary
legatees
.
It
is
so
,
with
testamentary
*NL*
dispositions
.
''
Again
he
pursed
up
his
lips
and
frowned
a
little
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
mean
to
say
for
certain
,
Mr.
Trumbull
,
that
my
brother
has
left
*NL*
his
land
away
from
our
family
?
''
said
Mrs.
Waule
,
on
whom
,
as
an
*NL*
unhopeful
woman
,
those
long
words
had
a
depressing
effect
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
man
might
as
well
turn
his
land
into
charity
land
at
once
as
leave
*NL*
it
to
some
people
,
''
observed
Solomon
,
his
sister
's
question
having
*NL*
drawn
no
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
Blue-Coat
land
?
''
said
Mrs.
Waule
,
again
.
``
Oh
,
Mr.
Trumbull
,
you
*NL*
never
can
mean
to
say
that
.
It
would
be
flying
in
the
face
of
the
*NL*
Almighty
that
's
prospered
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
Mrs.
Waule
was
speaking
,
Mr.
Borthrop
Trumbull
walked
away
from
*NL*
the
fireplace
towards
the
window
,
patrolling
with
his
fore-finger
round
*NL*
the
inside
of
his
stock
,
then
along
his
whiskers
and
the
curves
of
his
*NL*
hair
.
He
now
walked
to
Miss
Garth
's
work-table
,
opened
a
book
which
*NL*
lay
there
and
read
the
title
aloud
with
pompous
emphasis
as
if
he
were
*NL*
offering
it
for
sale
:

or
the
`
Maiden
of
the
*NL*
Mist
,
by
the
author
of
Waverley
.
'
''
Then
turning
the
page
,
he
began
*NL*
sonorously
--
``
The
course
of
four
centuries
has
well-nigh
elapsed
since
*NL*
the
series
of
events
which
are
related
in
the
following
chapters
took
*NL*
place
on
the
Continent
.
''
He
pronounced
the
last
truly
admirable
word
*NL*
with
the
accent
on
the
last
syllable
,
not
as
unaware
of
vulgar
usage
,
*NL*
but
feeling
that
this
novel
delivery
enhanced
the
sonorous
beauty
which
*NL*
his
reading
had
given
to
the
whole
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
the
servant
came
in
with
the
tray
,
so
that
the
moments
for
*NL*
answering
Mrs.
Waule
's
question
had
gone
by
safely
,
while
she
and
*NL*
Solomon
,
watching
Mr.
Trumbull
's
movements
,
were
thinking
that
high
*NL*
learning
interfered
sadly
with
serious
affairs
.
Mr.
Borthrop
Trumbull
*NL*
really
knew
nothing
about
old
Featherstone
's
will
;
but
he
could
hardly
*NL*
have
been
brought
to
declare
any
ignorance
unless
he
had
been
arrested
*NL*
for
misprision
of
treason
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
take
a
mere
mouthful
of
ham
and
a
glass
of
ale
,
''
he
said
,
*NL*
reassuringly
.
``
As
a
man
with
public
business
,
I
take
a
snack
when
I
*NL*
can
.
I
will
back
this
ham
,
''
he
added
,
after
swallowing
some
morsels
*NL*
with
alarming
haste
,
``
against
any
ham
in
the
three
kingdoms
.
In
my
*NL*
opinion
it
is
better
than
the
hams
at
Freshitt
Hall
--
and
I
think
I
am
*NL*
a
tolerable
judge
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Some
do
n't
like
so
much
sugar
in
their
hams
,
''
said
Mrs.
Waule
.
``
But
*NL*
my
poor
brother
would
always
have
sugar
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
any
person
demands
better
,
he
is
at
liberty

do
so

bless
me

what
an
aroma
!
I
should
be
glad
to
buy
in

quality

I
*NL*
know

There
is
some
gratification
to
a
gentleman
''
--
here
Mr.
*NL*
Trumbull
's
voice
conveyed
an
emotional
remonstrance
--
``
in
having
this
*NL*
kind
of
ham
set
on
his
table
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
pushed
aside
his
plate
,
poured
out
his
glass
of
ale
and
drew
his
*NL*
chair
a
little
forward
,
profiting
by
the
occasion
to
look
at
the
inner
*NL*
side
of
his
legs
,
which
he
stroked
approvingly
--
Mr.
Trumbull
having
*NL*
all
those
less
frivolous
airs
and
gestures
which
distinguish
the
*NL*
predominant
races
of
the
north
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
an
interesting
work
there
,

Garth

he
observed
,
*NL*
when
Mary
re-entered
.
``
It
is
by

that
is
Sir

one
of
his
works
myself

very
superior
publication

entitled
`
Ivanhoe

You
will
not

get
any
writer

beat
him
in
a
hurry

I
think

he
will
not

in
my
*NL*
opinion

be
speedily
surpassed

I
have
just
been

never

always

in

on

*NL*
``
I

hastening
away
again

``

I
have

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should

said
Mr.
Solomon
,
in
a
very
low
undertone
,
when
she
had
shut
the
door

behind
her

pointing
with
his
head
towards
the
absent
Mary

``
She

*NL*
*NL*
``
A

said
Mr.
Trumbull
,
finishing

his
ale
and
starting
up
with
an
emphatic
adjustment
of
his
waistcoat
.
*NL*
``

observed
her

been
mixing

point
in
a

and
a
*NL*
great
point
for
our
friend
up-stairs

poor

A
man
whose

When
Mr.

had
departed
with
a
fine

Solomon

leaning

forward

observed
to

2
Henry
VI
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
That
night
after
twelve
o'clock
Mary
Garth
relieved
the
watch
in
Mr.
*NL*
Featherstone
's
room
,
and
sat
there
alone
through
the
small
hours
.
She
*NL*
often
chose
this
task
,
in
which
she
found
some
pleasure
,
*NL*
notwithstanding
the
old
man
's
testiness
whenever
he
demanded
her
*NL*
attentions
.
There
were
intervals
in
which
she
could
sit
perfectly
*NL*
still
,
enjoying
the
outer
stillness
and
the
subdued
light
.
The
red
*NL*
fire
with
its
gently
audible
movement
seemed
like
a
solemn
existence
*NL*
calmly
independent
of
the
petty
passions
,
the
imbecile
desires
,
the
*NL*
straining
after
worthless
uncertainties
,
which
were
daily
moving
her
*NL*
contempt
.
Mary
was
fond
of
her
own
thoughts
,
and
could
amuse
herself
*NL*
well
sitting
in
twilight
with
her
hands
in
her
lap
;
for
,
having
early
*NL*
had
strong
reason
to
believe
that
things
were
not
likely
to
be
arranged
*NL*
for
her
peculiar
satisfaction
,
she
wasted
no
time
in
astonishment
and
*NL*
annoyance
at
that
fact
.
And
she
had
already
come
to
take
life
very
*NL*
much
as
a
comedy
in
which
she
had
a
proud
,
nay
,
a
generous
resolution
*NL*
not
to
act
the
mean
or
treacherous
part
.
Mary
might
have
become
*NL*
cynical
if
she
had
not
had
parents
whom
she
honored
,
and
a
well
of
*NL*
affectionate
gratitude
within
her
,
which
was
all
the
fuller
because
she
*NL*
had
learned
to
make
no
unreasonable
claims
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
sat
to-night
revolving
,
as
she
was
wont
,
the
scenes
of
the
day
,
her
*NL*
lips
often
curling
with
amusement
at
the
oddities
to
which
her
fancy
*NL*
added
fresh
drollery
:
people
were
so
ridiculous
with
their
illusions
,
*NL*
carrying
their
fool
's
caps
unawares
,
thinking
their
own
lies
opaque
*NL*
while
everybody
else
's
were
transparent
,
making
themselves
exceptions
*NL*
to
everything
,
as
if
when
all
the
world
looked
yellow
under
a
lamp
they
*NL*
alone
were
rosy
.
Yet
there
were
some
illusions
under
Mary
's
eyes
which
*NL*
were
not
quite
comic
to
her
.
She
was
secretly
convinced
,
though
she
*NL*
had
no
other
grounds
than
her
close
observation
of
old
Featherstone
's
*NL*
nature
,
that
in
spite
of
his
fondness
for
having
the
Vincys
about
him
,
*NL*
they
were
as
likely
to
be
disappointed
as
any
of
the
relations
whom
he
*NL*
kept
at
a
distance
.
She
had
a
good
deal
of
disdain
for
Mrs.
Vincy
's
*NL*
evident
alarm
lest
she
and
Fred
should
be
alone
together
,
but
it
did
*NL*
not
hinder
her
from
thinking
anxiously
of
the
way
in
which
Fred
would
*NL*
be
affected
,
if
it
should
turn
out
that
his
uncle
had
left
him
as
poor
*NL*
as
ever
.
She
could
make
a
butt
of
Fred
when
he
was
present
,
but
she
*NL*
did
not
enjoy
his
follies
when
he
was
absent
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
she
liked
her
thoughts
:
a
vigorous
young
mind
not
overbalanced
by
*NL*
passion
,
finds
a
good
in
making
acquaintance
with
life
,
and
watches
its
*NL*
own
powers
with
interest
.
Mary
had
plenty
of
merriment
within
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
thought
was
not
veined
by
any
solemnity
or
pathos
about
the
old
man
*NL*
on
the
bed
:
such
sentiments
are
easier
to
affect
than
to
feel
about
an
*NL*
aged
creature
whose
life
is
not
visibly
anything
but
a
remnant
of
*NL*
vices
.
She
had
always
seen
the
most
disagreeable
side
of
Mr.
*NL*
Featherstone
:
he
was
not
proud
of
her
,
and
she
was
only
useful
to
him
.
*NL*
To
be
anxious
about
a
soul
that
is
always
snapping
at
you
must
be
left
*NL*
to
the
saints
of
the
earth
;
and
Mary
was
not
one
of
them
.
She
had
*NL*
never
returned
him
a
harsh
word
,
and
had
waited
on
him
faithfully
:
that
*NL*
was
her
utmost
.
Old
Featherstone
himself
was
not
in
the
least
anxious
*NL*
about
his
soul
,
and
had
declined
to
see
Mr.
Tucker
on
the
subject
.
*NL*
*NL*
To-night
he
had
not
snapped
,
and
for
the
first
hour
or
two
he
lay
*NL*
remarkably
still
,
until
at
last
Mary
heard
him
rattling
his
bunch
of
*NL*
keys
against
the
tin
box
which
he
always
kept
in
the
bed
beside
him
.
*NL*
About
three
o'clock
he
said
,
with
remarkable
distinctness
,
``
Missy
,
come
*NL*
here
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
obeyed
,
and
found
that
he
had
already
drawn
the
tin
box
from
under
*NL*
the
clothes
,
though
he
usually
asked
to
have
this
done
for
him
;
and
he
*NL*
had
selected
the
key
.
He
now
unlocked
the
box
,
and
,
drawing
from
it
*NL*
another
key
,
looked
straight
at
her
with
eyes
that
seemed
to
have
*NL*
recovered
all
their
sharpness
and
said
,
``
How
many
of
'em
are
in
the
*NL*
house
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
mean
of
your
own
relations
,
sir
,
''
said
Mary
,
well
used
to
the
old
*NL*
man
's
way
of
speech
.
He
nodded
slightly
and
she
went
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Jonah
Featherstone
and
young
Cranch
are
sleeping
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
ay
,
they
stick
,
do
they
?
and
the
rest
--
they
come
every
day
,
I
'll
*NL*
warrant
--
Solomon
and
Jane
,
and
all
the
young
uns
?
They
come
peeping
,
*NL*
and
counting
and
casting
up
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
all
of
them
every
day
.
Mr.
Solomon
and
Mrs.
Waule
are
here
every
*NL*
day
,
and
the
others
come
often
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
man
listened
with
a
grimace
while
she
spoke
,
and
then
said
,
*NL*
relaxing
his
face
,
``
The
more
fools
they
.
You
hearken
,
missy
.
It
's
*NL*
three
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
and
I
've
got
all
my
faculties
as
well
as
*NL*
ever
I
had
in
my
life
.
I
know
all
my
property
,
and
where
the
money
's
*NL*
put
out
,
and
everything
.
And
I
've
made
everything
ready
to
change
my
*NL*
mind
,
and
do
as
I
like
at
the
last
.
Do
you
hear
,
missy
?
I
've
got
my
*NL*
faculties
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
sir
?
''
said
Mary
,
quietly
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
now
lowered
his
tone
with
an
air
of
deeper
cunning
.
``
I
've
made
two
*NL*
wills
,
and
I
'm
going
to
burn
one
.
Now
you
do
as
I
tell
you
.
This
is
*NL*
the
key
of
my
iron
chest
,
in
the
closet
there
.
You
push
well
at
the
*NL*
side
of
the
brass
plate
at
the
top
,
till
it
goes
like
a
bolt
:
then
you
*NL*
can
put
the
key
in
the
front
lock
and
turn
it
.
See
and
do
that
;
and
*NL*
take
out
the
topmost
paper
--
Last
Will
and
Testament
--
big
printed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
,
''
said
Mary
,
in
a
firm
voice
,
``
I
can
not
do
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
do
it
?
I
tell
you
,
you
must
,
''
said
the
old
man
,
his
voice
*NL*
beginning
to
shake
under
the
shock
of
this
resistance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
touch
your
iron
chest
or
your
will
.
I
must
refuse
to
do
*NL*
anything
that
might
lay
me
open
to
suspicion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
tell
you
,
I
'm
in
my
right
mind
.
Sha
n't
I
do
as
I
like
at
the
last
?
*NL*
I
made
two
wills
on
purpose
.
Take
the
key
,
I
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
,
I
will
not
,
''
said
Mary
,
more
resolutely
still
.
Her
repulsion
*NL*
was
getting
stronger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
tell
you
,
there
's
no
time
to
lose
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
help
that
,
sir
.
I
will
not
let
the
close
of
your
life
soil
*NL*
the
beginning
of
mine
.
I
will
not
touch
your
iron
chest
or
your
will
.
''
*NL*
She
moved
to
a
little
distance
from
the
bedside
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
man
paused
with
a
blank
stare
for
a
little
while
,
holding
the
*NL*
one
key
erect
on
the
ring
;
then
with
an
agitated
jerk
he
began
to
work
*NL*
with
his
bony
left
hand
at
emptying
the
tin
box
before
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Missy
,
''
he
began
to
say
,
hurriedly
,
``
look
here
!
take
the
money
--
the
*NL*
notes
and
gold
--
look
here
--
take
it
--
you
shall
have
it
all
--
do
as
I
*NL*
tell
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
made
an
effort
to
stretch
out
the
key
towards
her
as
far
as
*NL*
possible
,
and
Mary
again
retreated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
not
touch
your
key
or
your
money
,
sir
.
Pray
do
n't
ask
me
to
do
*NL*
it
again
.
If
you
do
,
I
must
go
and
call
your
brother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
let
his
hand
fall
,
and
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
Mary
saw
old
*NL*
Peter
Featherstone
begin
to
cry
childishly
.
She
said
,
in
as
gentle
a
*NL*
tone
as
she
could
command
,
``
Pray
put
up
your
money
,
sir
;
''
and
then
went
*NL*
away
to
her
seat
by
the
fire
,
hoping
this
would
help
to
convince
him
*NL*
that
it
was
useless
to
say
more
.
Presently
he
rallied
and
said
*NL*
eagerly
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
here
,
then
.
Call
the
young
chap
.
Call
Fred
Vincy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
's
heart
began
to
beat
more
quickly
.
Various
ideas
rushed
through
*NL*
her
mind
as
to
what
the
burning
of
a
second
will
might
imply
.
She
had
*NL*
to
make
a
difficult
decision
in
a
hurry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
call
him
,
if
you
will
let
me
call
Mr.
Jonah
and
others
with
*NL*
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nobody
else
,
I
say
.
The
young
chap
.
I
shall
do
as
I
like
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait
till
broad
daylight
,
sir
,
when
every
one
is
stirring
.
Or
let
me
*NL*
call
Simmons
now
,
to
go
and
fetch
the
lawyer
?
He
can
be
here
in
less
*NL*
than
two
hours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lawyer
?
What
do
I
want
with
the
lawyer
?
Nobody
shall
know
--
I
say
,
*NL*
nobody

know
.
I
shall
do
as
I
like
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
call
some
one
else
,
sir
,
''
said
Mary
,
persuasively
.
She
did
not
*NL*
like
her
position
--
alone
with
the
old
man
,
who
seemed
to
show
a
strange
*NL*
flaring
of
nervous
energy
which
enabled
him
to
speak
again
and
again
*NL*
without
falling
into
his
usual
cough
;
yet
she
desired
not
to
push
*NL*
unnecessarily
the
contradiction
which
agitated
him
.
``
Let
me
,
pray
,
*NL*
call
some
one
else
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
let
me
alone
,
I
say
.
Look
here
,
missy
.
Take
the
money
.
You
'll
*NL*
never
have
the
chance
again
.
It
's
pretty
nigh
two
hundred
--
there
's
*NL*
more
in
the
box
,
and
nobody
knows
how
much
there
was
.
Take
it
and
do
*NL*
as
I
tell
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
,
standing
by
the
fire
,
saw
its
red
light
falling
on
the
old
man
,
*NL*
propped
up
on
his
pillows
and
bed-rest
,
with
his
bony
hand
holding
out
*NL*
the
key
,
and
the
money
lying
on
the
quilt
before
him
.
She
never
forgot
*NL*
that
vision
of
a
man
wanting
to
do
as
he
liked
at
the
last
.
But
the
*NL*
way
in
which
he
had
put
the
offer
of
the
money
urged
her
to
speak
with
*NL*
harder
resolution
than
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
of
no
use
,
sir
.
I
will
not
do
it
.
Put
up
your
money
.
I
will
*NL*
not
touch
your
money
.
I
will
do
anything
else
I
can
to
comfort
you
;
*NL*
but
I
will
not
touch
your
keys
or
your
money
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anything
else
anything
else
!
''
said
old
Featherstone
,
with
hoarse
rage
,
*NL*
which
,
as
if
in
a
nightmare
,
tried
to
be
loud
,
and
yet
was
only
just
*NL*
audible
.
``
I
want
nothing
else
.
You
come
here
--
you
come
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
approached
him
cautiously
,
knowing
him
too
well
.
She
saw
him
*NL*
dropping
his
keys
and
trying
to
grasp
his
stick
,
while
he
looked
at
her
*NL*
like
an
aged
hyena
,
the
muscles
of
his
face
getting
distorted
with
the
*NL*
effort
of
his
hand
.
She
paused
at
a
safe
distance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
give
you
some
cordial
,
''
she
said
,
quietly
,
``
and
try
to
compose
*NL*
yourself
.
You
will
perhaps
go
to
sleep
.
And
to-morrow
by
daylight
you
*NL*
can
do
as
you
like
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
lifted
the
stick
,
in
spite
of
her
being
beyond
his
reach
,
and
threw
*NL*
it
with
a
hard
effort
which
was
but
impotence
.
It
fell
,
slipping
over
*NL*
the
foot
of
the
bed
.
Mary
let
it
lie
,
and
retreated
to
her
chair
by
*NL*
the
fire
.
By-and-by
she
would
go
to
him
with
the
cordial
.
Fatigue
*NL*
would
make
him
passive
.
It
was
getting
towards
the
chillest
moment
of
*NL*
the
morning
,
the
fire
had
got
low
,
and
she
could
see
through
the
chink
*NL*
between
the
moreen
window-curtains
the
light
whitened
by
the
blind
.
*NL*
Having
put
some
wood
on
the
fire
and
thrown
a
shawl
over
her
,
she
sat
*NL*
down
,
hoping
that
Mr.
Featherstone
might
now
fall
asleep
.
If
she
went
*NL*
near
him
the
irritation
might
be
kept
up
.
He
had
said
nothing
after
*NL*
throwing
the
stick
,
but
she
had
seen
him
taking
his
keys
again
and
*NL*
laying
his
right
hand
on
the
money
.
He
did
not
put
it
up
,
however
,
and
*NL*
she
thought
that
he
was
dropping
off
to
sleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Mary
herself
began
to
be
more
agitated
by
the
remembrance
of
what
*NL*
she
had
gone
through
,
than
she
had
been
by
the
reality
--
questioning
*NL*
those
acts
of
hers
which
had
come
imperatively
and
excluded
all
*NL*
question
in
the
critical
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
Presently
the
dry
wood
sent
out
a
flame
which
illuminated
every
*NL*
crevice
,
and
Mary
saw
that
the
old
man
was
lying
quietly
with
his
head
*NL*
turned
a
little
on
one
side
.
She
went
towards
him
with
inaudible
*NL*
steps
,
and
thought
that
his
face
looked
strangely
motionless
;
but
the
*NL*
next
moment
the
movement
of
the
flame
communicating
itself
to
all
*NL*
objects
made
her
uncertain
.
The
violent
beating
of
her
heart
rendered
*NL*
her
perceptions
so
doubtful
that
even
when
she
touched
him
and
listened
*NL*
for
his
breathing
,
she
could
not
trust
her
conclusions
.
She
went
to
*NL*
the
window
and
gently
propped
aside
the
curtain
and
blind
,
so
that
the
*NL*
still
light
of
the
sky
fell
on
the
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
moment
she
ran
to
the
bell
and
rang
it
energetically
.
In
a
*NL*
very
little
while
there
was
no
longer
any
doubt
that
Peter
Featherstone
*NL*
was
dead
,
with
his
right
hand
clasping
the
keys
,
and
his
left
hand
*NL*
lying
on
the
heap
of
notes
and
gold
.

''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
on
a
morning
of
May
that
Peter
Featherstone
was
buried
.
In
the
*NL*
prosaic
neighborhood
of
Middlemarch
,
May
was
not
always
warm
and
sunny
,
*NL*
and
on
this
particular
morning
a
chill
wind
was
blowing
the
blossoms
*NL*
from
the
surrounding
gardens
on
to
the
green
mounds
of
Lowick
*NL*
churchyard
.
Swiftly
moving
clouds
only
now
and
then
allowed
a
gleam
to
*NL*
light
up
any
object
,
whether
ugly
or
beautiful
,
that
happened
to
stand
*NL*
within
its
golden
shower
.
In
the
churchyard
the
objects
were
*NL*
remarkably
various
,
for
there
was
a
little
country
crowd
waiting
to
see
*NL*
the
funeral
.
The
news
had
spread
that
it
was
to
be
a
``
big
burying
;
''
*NL*
the
old
gentleman
had
left
written
directions
about
everything
and
*NL*
meant
to
have
a
funeral
``
beyond
his
betters
.
''
This
was
true
;
for
old
*NL*
Featherstone
had
not
been
a
Harpagon
whose
passions
had
all
been
*NL*
devoured
by
the
ever-lean
and
ever-hungry
passion
of
saving
,
and
who
*NL*
would
drive
a
bargain
with
his
undertaker
beforehand
.
He
loved
money
,
*NL*
but
he
also
loved
to
spend
it
in
gratifying
his
peculiar
tastes
,
and
*NL*
perhaps
he
loved
it
best
of
all
as
a
means
of
making
others
feel
his
*NL*
power
more
or
less
uncomfortably
.
If
any
one
will
here
contend
that
*NL*
there
must
have
been
traits
of
goodness
in
old
Featherstone
,
I
will
not
*NL*
presume
to
deny
this
;
but
I
must
observe
that
goodness
is
of
a
modest
*NL*
nature
,
easily
discouraged
,
and
when
much
privacy
,
elbowed
in
early
*NL*
life
by
unabashed
vices
,
is
apt
to
retire
into
extreme
privacy
,
so
that
*NL*
it
is
more
easily
believed
in
by
those
who
construct
a
selfish
old
*NL*
gentleman
theoretically
,
than
by
those
who
form
the
narrower
judgments
*NL*
based
on
his
personal
acquaintance
.
In
any
case
,
he
had
been
bent
on
*NL*
having
a
handsome
funeral
,
and
on
having
persons
``
bid
''
to
it
who
would
*NL*
rather
have
stayed
at
home
.
He
had
even
desired
that
female
relatives
*NL*
should
follow
him
to
the
grave
,
and
poor
sister
Martha
had
taken
a
*NL*
difficult
journey
for
this
purpose
from
the
Chalky
Flats
.
She
and
Jane
*NL*
would
have
been
altogether
cheered
-LRB-
in
a
tearful
manner
-RRB-
by
this
sign
*NL*
that
a
brother
who
disliked
seeing
them
while
he
was
living
had
been
*NL*
prospectively
fond
of
their
presence
when
he
should
have
become
a
*NL*
testator
,
if
the
sign
had
not
been
made
equivocal
by
being
extended
to
*NL*
Mrs.
Vincy
,
whose
expense
in
handsome
crape
seemed
to
imply
the
most
*NL*
presumptuous
hopes
,
aggravated
by
a
bloom
of
complexion
which
told
*NL*
pretty
plainly
that
she
was
not
a
blood-relation
,
but
of
that
generally
*NL*
objectionable
class
called
wife
's
kin
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
are
all
of
us
imaginative
in
some
form
or
other
,
for
images
are
the
*NL*
brood
of
desire
;
and
poor
old
Featherstone
,
who
laughed
much
at
the
way
*NL*
in
which
others
cajoled
themselves
,
did
not
escape
the
fellowship
of
*NL*
illusion
.
In
writing
the
programme
for
his
burial
he
certainly
did
not
*NL*
make
clear
to
himself
that
his
pleasure
in
the
little
drama
of
which
it
*NL*
formed
a
part
was
confined
to
anticipation
.
In
chuckling
over
the
*NL*
vexations
he
could
inflict
by
the
rigid
clutch
of
his
dead
hand
,
he
*NL*
inevitably
mingled
his
consciousness
with
that
livid
stagnant
presence
,
*NL*
and
so
far
as
he
was
preoccupied
with
a
future
life
,
it
was
with
one
of
*NL*
gratification
inside
his
coffin
.
Thus
old
Featherstone
was
*NL*
imaginative
,
after
his
fashion
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
the
three
mourning-coaches
were
filled
according
to
the
*NL*
written
orders
of
the
deceased
.
There
were
pall-bearers
on
horseback
,
*NL*
with
the
richest
scarfs
and
hatbands
,
and
even
the
under-bearers
had
*NL*
trappings
of
woe
which
were
of
a
good
well-priced
quality
.
The
black
*NL*
procession
,
when
dismounted
,
looked
the
larger
for
the
smallness
of
the
*NL*
churchyard
;
the
heavy
human
faces
and
the
black
draperies
shivering
in
*NL*
the
wind
seemed
to
tell
of
a
world
strangely
incongruous
with
the
*NL*
lightly
dropping
blossoms
and
the
gleams
of
sunshine
on
the
daisies
.
*NL*
The
clergyman
who
met
the
procession
was
Mr.
Cadwallader
--
also
*NL*
according
to
the
request
of
Peter
Featherstone
,
prompted
as
usual
by
*NL*
peculiar
reasons
.
Having
a
contempt
for
curates
,
whom
he
always
called
*NL*
understrappers
,
he
was
resolved
to
be
buried
by
a
beneficed
clergyman
.
*NL*
Mr.
Casaubon
was
out
of
the
question
,
not
merely
because
he
declined
*NL*
duty
of
this
sort
,
but
because
Featherstone
had
an
especial
dislike
to
*NL*
him
as
the
rector
of
his
own
parish
,
who
had
a
lien
on
the
land
in
the
*NL*
shape
of
tithe
,
also
as
the
deliverer
of
morning
sermons
,
which
the
old
*NL*
man
,
being
in
his
pew
and
not
at
all
sleepy
,
had
been
obliged
to
sit
*NL*
through
with
an
inward
snarl
.
He
had
an
objection
to
a
parson
stuck
up
*NL*
above
his
head
preaching
to
him
.
But
his
relations
with
Mr.
*NL*
Cadwallader
had
been
of
a
different
kind
:
the
trout-stream
which
ran
*NL*
through
Mr.
Casaubon
's
land
took
its
course
through
Featherstone
's
*NL*
also
,
so
that
Mr.
Cadwallader
was
a
parson
who
had
had
to
ask
a
favor
*NL*
instead
of
preaching
.
Moreover
,
he
was
one
of
the
high
gentry
living
*NL*
four
miles
away
from
Lowick
,
and
was
thus
exalted
to
an
equal
sky
with
*NL*
the
sheriff
of
the
county
and
other
dignities
vaguely
regarded
as
*NL*
necessary
to
the
system
of
things
.
There
would
be
a
satisfaction
in
*NL*
being
buried
by
Mr.
Cadwallader
,
whose
very
name
offered
a
fine
*NL*
opportunity
for
pronouncing
wrongly
if
you
liked
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
distinction
conferred
on
the
Rector
of
Tipton
and
Freshitt
was
the
*NL*
reason
why
Mrs.
Cadwallader
made
one
of
the
group
that
watched
old
*NL*
Featherstone
's
funeral
from
an
upper
window
of
the
manor
.
She
was
not
*NL*
fond
of
visiting
that
house
,
but
she
liked
,
as
she
said
,
to
see
*NL*
collections
of
strange
animals
such
as
there
would
be
at
this
funeral
;
*NL*
and
she
had
persuaded
Sir
James
and
the
young
Lady
Chettam
to
drive
the
*NL*
Rector
and
herself
to
Lowick
in
order
that
the
visit
might
be
*NL*
altogether
pleasant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
go
anywhere
with
you
,
Mrs.
Cadwallader
,
''
Celia
had
said
;
``
but
I
*NL*
do
n't
like
funerals
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
dear
,
when
you
have
a
clergyman
in
your
family
you
must
*NL*
accommodate
your
tastes
:
I
did
that
very
early
.
When
I
married
*NL*
Humphrey
I
made
up
my
mind
to
like
sermons
,
and
I
set
out
by
liking
the
*NL*
end
very
much
.
That
soon
spread
to
the
middle
and
the
beginning
,
*NL*
because
I
could
n't
have
the
end
without
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
to
be
sure
not
,
''
said
the
Dowager
Lady
Chettam
,
with
stately
*NL*
emphasis
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
upper
window
from
which
the
funeral
could
be
well
seen
was
in
the
*NL*
room
occupied
by
Mr.
Casaubon
when
he
had
been
forbidden
to
work
;
but
*NL*
he
had
resumed
nearly
his
habitual
style
of
life
now
in
spite
of
*NL*
warnings
and
prescriptions
,
and
after
politely
welcoming
Mrs.
*NL*
Cadwallader
had
slipped
again
into
the
library
to
chew
a
cud
of
erudite
*NL*
mistake
about
Cush
and
Mizraim
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
for
her
visitors
Dorothea
too
might
have
been
shut
up
in
the
*NL*
library
,
and
would
not
have
witnessed
this
scene
of
old
Featherstone
's
*NL*
funeral
,
which
,
aloof
as
it
seemed
to
be
from
the
tenor
of
her
life
,
*NL*
always
afterwards
came
back
to
her
at
the
touch
of
certain
sensitive
*NL*
points
in
memory
,
just
as
the
vision
of
St.
Peter
's
at
Rome
was
inwoven
*NL*
with
moods
of
despondency
.
Scenes
which
make
vital
changes
in
our
*NL*
neighbors
'
lot
are
but
the
background
of
our
own
,
yet
,
like
a
*NL*
particular
aspect
of
the
fields
and
trees
,
they
become
associated
for
*NL*
us
with
the
epochs
of
our
own
history
,
and
make
a
part
of
that
unity
*NL*
which
lies
in
the
selection
of
our
keenest
consciousness
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
dream-like
association
of
something
alien
and
ill-understood
with
*NL*
the
deepest
secrets
of
her
experience
seemed
to
mirror
that
sense
of
*NL*
loneliness
which
was
due
to
the
very
ardor
of
Dorothea
's
nature
.
The
*NL*
country
gentry
of
old
time
lived
in
a
rarefied
social
air
:
dotted
apart
*NL*
on
their
stations
up
the
mountain
they
looked
down
with
imperfect
*NL*
discrimination
on
the
belts
of
thicker
life
below
.
And
Dorothea
was
*NL*
not
at
ease
in
the
perspective
and
chilliness
of
that
height
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
not
look
any
more
,
''
said
Celia
,
after
the
train
had
entered
*NL*
the
church
,
placing
herself
a
little
behind
her
husband
's
elbow
so
that
*NL*
she
could
slyly
touch
his
coat
with
her
cheek
.
``
I
dare
say
Dodo
likes
*NL*
it
:
she
is
fond
of
melancholy
things
and
ugly
people
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
fond
of
knowing
something
about
the
people
I
live
among
,
''
said
*NL*
Dorothea
,
who
had
been
watching
everything
with
the
interest
of
a
monk
*NL*
on
his
holiday
tour
.
``
It
seems
to
me
we
know
nothing
of
our
neighbors
,
*NL*
unless
they
are
cottagers
.
One
is
constantly
wondering
what
sort
of
*NL*
lives
other
people
lead
,
and
how
they
take
things
.
I
am
quite
obliged
*NL*
to
Mrs.
Cadwallader
for
coming
and
calling
me
out
of
the
library
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
right
to
feel
obliged
to
me
,
''
said
Mrs.
Cadwallader
.
``
Your
rich
*NL*
Lowick
farmers
are
as
curious
as
any
buffaloes
or
bisons
,
and
I
dare
*NL*
say
you
do
n't
half
see
them
at
church
.
They
are
quite
different
from
*NL*
your
uncle
's
tenants
or
Sir
James
's
--
monsters

farmers
without

landlords

*NL*
*NL*
``
Most
of
these
followers
are
not

''
said
Sir
James
;
``
I
*NL*
suppose
they
are
legatees
from
a
distance
,
or
from
Middlemarch

*NL*
Lovegood
tells
me

old
fellow

left
a
good
deal
of
money
as
well

as

*NL*
*NL*
``

now

many
younger
sons

said
Mrs.
Cadwallader
.
``
Ah

turning
round
at
the
sound
of
*NL*
the
opening
door
,
``
here
is
Mr.
Brooke

felt
that

funeral

Mr.

nodding
at
Dorothea
as
she
came
towards
him

looked
into

library

I
saw

``

``

Sir

looking
interrogatively
at

with

Dorothea

It
is
a
blot
on
the
morning
I
can
not
bear
to
*NL*
think
that
any
one
should
die
and
leave
no
love
behind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
going
to
say
more
,
but
she
saw
her
husband
enter
and
seat
*NL*
himself
a
little
in
the
background
.
The
difference
his
presence
made
*NL*
to
her
was
not
always
a
happy
one
:
she
felt
that
he
often
inwardly
*NL*
objected
to
her
speech
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Positively
,
''
exclaimed
Mrs.
Cadwallader
,
``
there
is
a
new
face
come
out
*NL*
from
behind
that
broad
man
queerer
than
any
of
them
:
a
little
round
*NL*
head
with
bulging
eyes
--
a
sort
of
frog-face
--
do
look
.
He
must
be
of
*NL*
another
blood
,
I
think
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
see
!
''
said
Celia
,
with
awakened
curiosity
,
standing
behind
Mrs.
*NL*
Cadwallader
and
leaning
forward
over
her
head
.
``
Oh
,
what
an
odd
face
!
''
*NL*
Then
with
a
quick
change
to
another
sort
of
surprised
expression
,
she
*NL*
added
,
``
Why
,
Dodo
,
you
never
told
me
that
Mr.
Ladislaw
was
come
again
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
felt
a
shock
of
alarm
:
every
one
noticed
her
sudden
paleness
*NL*
as
she
looked
up
immediately
at
her
uncle
,
while
Mr.
Casaubon
looked
at
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
came
with
me
,
you
know
;
he
is
my
guest
--
puts
up
with
me
at
the
*NL*
Grange
,
''
said
Mr.
Brooke
,
in
his
easiest
tone
,
nodding
at
Dorothea
,
as
*NL*
if
the
announcement
were
just
what
she
might
have
expected
.
``
And
we
*NL*
have
brought
the
picture
at
the
top
of
the
carriage
.
I
knew
you
would
*NL*
be
pleased
with
the
surprise
,
Casaubon
.
There
you
are
to
the
very
*NL*
life
--
as
Aquinas
,
you
know
.
Quite
the
right
sort
of
thing
.
And
you
*NL*
will
hear
young
Ladislaw
talk
about
it
.
He
talks
uncommonly
*NL*
well
--
points
out
this
,
that
,
and
the
other
--
knows
art
and
everything
of
*NL*
that
kind
--
companionable
,
you
know
--
is
up
with
you
in
any
track
--
what
*NL*
I
've
been
wanting
a
long
while
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Casaubon
bowed
with
cold
politeness
,
mastering
his
irritation
,
but
*NL*
only
so
far
as
to
be
silent
.
He
remembered
Will
's
letter
quite
as
well
*NL*
as
Dorothea
did
;
he
had
noticed
that
it
was
not
among
the
letters
which
*NL*
had
been
reserved
for
him
on
his
recovery
,
and
secretly
concluding
that
*NL*
Dorothea
had
sent
word
to
Will
not
to
come
to
Lowick
,
he
had
shrunk
*NL*
with
proud
sensitiveness
from
ever
recurring
to
the
subject
.
He
now
*NL*
inferred
that
she
had
asked
her
uncle
to
invite
Will
to
the
Grange
;
and
*NL*
she
felt
it
impossible
at
that
moment
to
enter
into
any
explanation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Cadwallader
's
eyes
,
diverted
from
the
churchyard
,
saw
a
good
deal
*NL*
of
dumb
show
which
was
not
so
intelligible
to
her
as
she
could
have
*NL*
desired
,
and
could
not
repress
the
question
,
``
Who
is
Mr.
Ladislaw
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
young
relative
of
Mr.
Casaubon
's
,
''
said
Sir
James
,
promptly
.
His
*NL*
good-nature
often
made
him
quick
and
clear-seeing
in
personal
matters
,
*NL*
and
he
had
divined
from
Dorothea
's
glance
at
her
husband
that
there
was
*NL*
some
alarm
in
her
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
very
nice
young
fellow
--
Casaubon
has
done
everything
for
him
,
''
*NL*
explained
Mr.
Brooke
.
``
He
repays
your
expense
in
him
,
Casaubon
,
''
he
*NL*
went
on
,
nodding
encouragingly
.
``
I
hope
he
will
stay
with
me
a
long
*NL*
while
and
we
shall
make
something
of
my
documents
.
I
have
plenty
of
*NL*
ideas
and
facts
,
you
know
,
and
I
can
see
he
is
just
the
man
to
put
them
*NL*
into
shape
--
remembers
what
the
right
quotations
are
,
omne
tulit
*NL*
punctum
,
and
that
sort
of
thing
--
gives
subjects
a
kind
of
turn
.
I
*NL*
invited
him
some
time
ago
when
you
were
ill
,
Casaubon
;
Dorothea
said
*NL*
you
could
n't
have
anybody
in
the
house
,
you
know
,
and
she
asked
me
to
*NL*
write
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Dorothea
felt
that
every
word
of
her
uncle
's
was
about
as
pleasant
*NL*
as
a
grain
of
sand
in
the
eye
to
Mr.
Casaubon
.
It
would
be
altogether
*NL*
unfitting
now
to
explain
that
she
had
not
wished
her
uncle
to
invite
*NL*
Will
Ladislaw
.
She
could
not
in
the
least
make
clear
to
herself
the
*NL*
reasons
for
her
husband
's
dislike
to
his
presence
--
a
dislike
painfully
*NL*
impressed
on
her
by
the
scene
in
the
library
;
but
she
felt
the
*NL*
unbecomingness
of
saying
anything
that
might
convey
a
notion
of
it
to
*NL*
others
.
Mr.
Casaubon
,
indeed
,
had
not
thoroughly
represented
those
*NL*
mixed
reasons
to
himself
;
irritated
feeling
with
him
,
as
with
all
of
*NL*
us
,
seeking
rather
for
justification
than
for
self-knowledge
.
But
he
*NL*
wished
to
repress
outward
signs
,
and
only
Dorothea
could
discern
the
*NL*
changes
in
her
husband
's
face
before
he
observed
with
more
of
dignified
*NL*
bending
and
sing-song
than
usual
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
exceedingly
hospitable
,
my
dear
sir
;
and
I
owe
you
*NL*
acknowledgments
for
exercising
your
hospitality
towards
a
relative
of
*NL*
mine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
funeral
was
ended
now
,
and
the
churchyard
was
being
cleared
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
you
can
see
him
,
Mrs.
Cadwallader
,
''
said
Celia
.
``
He
is
just
like
*NL*
a
miniature
of
Mr.
Casaubon
's
aunt
that
hangs
in
Dorothea
's
*NL*
boudoir
--
quite
nice-looking
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
very
pretty
sprig
,
''
said
Mrs.
Cadwallader
,
dryly
.
``
What
is
your
*NL*
nephew
to
be
,
Mr.
Casaubon
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pardon
me
,

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

you

''
interposed
Mr.
Brooke
,
``
he
is
trying
his
wings

He
*NL*
is
just
the
sort
of
young
fellow
to
rise

I
should
be
glad
to
give
him
*NL*
an
opportunity

He
would
make
a
good

Swift

that
sort
of
man

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I

said
Mrs.
Cadwallader
.
``
One
who
can
write
speeches

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
fetch
him
in
now

eh

Casaubon
?
''
said
Mr.
Brooke
.
``
He
would
n't
*NL*
come
in
till
I
had
announced
him
,
you
know

And
we
'll
go
down
and
look
*NL*
at
the
picture

There
you
are
to
the
life
:
a
deep
subtle
sort
of
*NL*
thinker
with
his
fore-finger
on
the
page
,
while
Saint
Bonaventure
or
*NL*
somebody
else
,
rather
fat
and
florid
,
is
looking
up
at
the
Trinity

*NL*
Everything
is
symbolical
,
you
know

the
higher
style
of
art
:
I
like
*NL*
that
up
to
a
certain
point
,
but
not
too
far

it

rather
straining
to

keep
up
with

you

you
are
at
home

And

your
painter

flesh

good

solidity

transparency

everything

I
went
into
that
a
great
deal

one

REGNARD

Le

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
animals
entered
the
Ark
in
pairs
,
one
may
imagine
that
allied
*NL*
species
made
much
private
remark
on
each
other
,
and
were
tempted
to
*NL*
think
that
so
many
forms
feeding
on
the
same
store
of
fodder
were
*NL*
eminently
superfluous
,
as
tending
to
diminish
the
rations
.
-LRB-
I
fear
the
*NL*
part
played
by
the
vultures
on
that
occasion
would
be
too
painful
for
*NL*
art
to
represent
,
those
birds
being
disadvantageously
naked
about
the
*NL*
gullet
,
and
apparently
without
rites
and
ceremonies
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
The
same
sort
of
temptation
befell
the
Christian
Carnivora
who
formed
*NL*
Peter
Featherstone
's
funeral
procession
;
most
of
them
having
their
*NL*
minds
bent
on
a
limited
store
which
each
would
have
liked
to
get
the
*NL*
most
of
.
The
long-recognized
blood-relations
and
connections
by
*NL*
marriage
made
already
a
goodly
number
,
which
,
multiplied
by
*NL*
possibilities
,
presented
a
fine
range
for
jealous
conjecture
and
*NL*
pathetic
hopefulness
.
Jealousy
of
the
Vincys
had
created
a
fellowship
*NL*
in
hostility
among
all
persons
of
the
Featherstone
blood
,
so
that
in
*NL*
the
absence
of
any
decided
indication
that
one
of
themselves
was
to
*NL*
have
more
than
the
rest
,
the
dread
lest
that
long-legged
Fred
Vincy
*NL*
should
have
the
land
was
necessarily
dominant
,
though
it
left
abundant
*NL*
feeling
and
leisure
for
vaguer
jealousies
,
such
as
were
entertained
*NL*
towards
Mary
Garth
.
Solomon
found
time
to
reflect
that
Jonah
was
*NL*
undeserving
,
and
Jonah
to
abuse
Solomon
as
greedy
;
Jane
,
the
elder
*NL*
sister
,
held
that
Martha
's
children
ought
not
to
expect
so
much
as
the
*NL*
young
Waules
;
and
Martha
,
more
lax
on
the
subject
of
primogeniture
,
was
*NL*
sorry
to
think
that
Jane
was
so
``
having
.
''
These
nearest
of
kin
were
*NL*
naturally
impressed
with
the
unreasonableness
of
expectations
in
*NL*
cousins
and
second
cousins
,
and
used
their
arithmetic
in
reckoning
the
*NL*
large
sums
that
small
legacies
might
mount
to
,
if
there
were
too
many
*NL*
of
them
.
Two
cousins
were
present
to
hear
the
will
,
and
a
second
*NL*
cousin
besides
Mr.
Trumbull
.
This
second
cousin
was
a
Middlemarch
*NL*
mercer
of
polite
manners
and
superfluous
aspirates
.
The
two
cousins
*NL*
were
elderly
men
from
Brassing
,
one
of
them
conscious
of
claims
on
the
*NL*
score
of
inconvenient
expense
sustained
by
him
in
presents
of
oysters
*NL*
and
other
eatables
to
his
rich
cousin
Peter
;
the
other
entirely
*NL*
saturnine
,
leaning
his
hands
and
chin
on
a
stick
,
and
conscious
of
*NL*
claims
based
on
no
narrow
performance
but
on
merit
generally
:
both
*NL*
blameless
citizens
of
Brassing
,
who
wished
that
Jonah
Featherstone
did
*NL*
not
live
there
.
The
wit
of
a
family
is
usually
best
received
among
*NL*
strangers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
Trumbull
himself
is
pretty
sure
of
five
hundred
--
_
that
_
you
may
*NL*
depend
,
--
I
should
n't
wonder
if
my
brother
promised
him
,
''
said
Solomon
,
*NL*
musing
aloud
with
his
sisters
,
the
evening
before
the
funeral
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
,
dear
!
''
said
poor
sister
Martha
,
whose
imagination
of
hundreds
*NL*
had
been
habitually
narrowed
to
the
amount
of
her
unpaid
rent
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
in
the
morning
all
the
ordinary
currents
of
conjecture
were
*NL*
disturbed
by
the
presence
of
a
strange
mourner
who
had
plashed
among
*NL*
them
as
if
from
the
moon
.
This
was
the
stranger
described
by
Mrs.
*NL*
Cadwallader
as
frog-faced
:
a
man
perhaps
about
two
or
three
and
thirty
,
*NL*
whose
prominent
eyes
,
thin-lipped
,
downward-curved
mouth
,
and
hair
*NL*
sleekly
brushed
away
from
a
forehead
that
sank
suddenly
above
the
ridge
*NL*
of
the
eyebrows
,
certainly
gave
his
face
a
batrachian
unchangeableness
*NL*
of
expression
.
Here
,
clearly
,
was
a
new
legatee
;
else
why
was
he
*NL*
bidden
as
a
mourner
?
Here
were
new
possibilities
,
raising
a
new
*NL*
uncertainty
,
which
almost
checked
remark
in
the
mourning-coaches
.
We
*NL*
are
all
humiliated
by
the
sudden
discovery
of
a
fact
which
has
existed
*NL*
very
comfortably
and
perhaps
been
staring
at
us
in
private
while
we
*NL*
have
been
making
up
our
world
entirely
without
it
.
No
one
had
seen
*NL*
this
questionable
stranger
before
except
Mary
Garth
,
and
she
knew
*NL*
nothing
more
of
him
than
that
he
had
twice
been
to
Stone
Court
when
Mr.
*NL*
Featherstone
was
down-stairs
,
and
had
sat
alone
with
him
for
several
*NL*
hours
.
She
had
found
an
opportunity
of
mentioning
this
to
her
father
,
*NL*
and
perhaps
Caleb
's
were
the
only
eyes
,
except
the
lawyer
's
,
which
*NL*
examined
the
stranger
with
more
of
inquiry
than
of
disgust
or
*NL*
suspicion
.
Caleb
Garth
,
having
little
expectation
and
less
cupidity
,
*NL*
was
interested
in
the
verification
of
his
own
guesses
,
and
the
calmness
*NL*
with
which
he
half
smilingly
rubbed
his
chin
and
shot
intelligent
*NL*
glances
much
as
if
he
were
valuing
a
tree
,
made
a
fine
contrast
with
*NL*
the
alarm
or
scorn
visible
in
other
faces
when
the
unknown
mourner
,
*NL*
whose
name
was
understood
to
be
Rigg
,
entered
the
wainscoted
parlor
and
*NL*
took
his
seat
near
the
door
to
make
part
of
the
audience
when
the
will
*NL*
should
be
read
.
Just
then
Mr.
Solomon
and
Mr.
Jonah
were
gone
*NL*
up-stairs
with
the
lawyer
to
search
for
the
will
;
and
Mrs.
Waule
,
*NL*
seeing
two
vacant
seats
between
herself
and
Mr.
Borthrop
Trumbull
,
had
*NL*
the
spirit
to
move
next
to
that
great
authority
,
who
was
handling
his
*NL*
watch-seals
and
trimming
his
outlines
with
a
determination
not
to
show
*NL*
anything
so
compromising
to
a
man
of
ability
as
wonder
or
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
you
know
everything
about
what
my
poor
brother
's
done
,
Mr.
*NL*
Trumbull
,
''
said
Mrs.
Waule
,
in
the
lowest
of
her
woolly
tones
,
while
*NL*
she
turned
her
crape-shadowed
bonnet
towards
Mr.
Trumbull
's

*NL*
*NL*
``
My
good
lady
,
whatever
was
told
me
was
told
in
confidence

''
said
the
*NL*
auctioneer
,
putting
his
hand
up
to
screen
that
secret
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Them
who
've
made
sure
of
their
good-luck
may
be
disappointed
yet
,
''
*NL*
Mrs.
Waule
continued
,
finding
some
relief
in
this
communication
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hopes
are
often
delusive
,
''
said
Mr.
Trumbull
,
still
in
confidence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
said
Mrs.
Waule
,
looking
across
at
the
Vincys
,
and
then
moving
*NL*
back
to
the
side
of
her
sister
Martha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
wonderful
how
close
poor
Peter
was
,
''
she
said
,
in
the
same
*NL*
undertones
.
``
We
none
of
us
know
what
he
might
have
had
on
his
mind
.
I
*NL*
only
hope
and
trust
he
was
n't
a
worse
liver
than
we
think
of
,
Martha
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Mrs.
Cranch
was
bulky
,
and
,
breathing
asthmatically
,
had
the
*NL*
additional
motive
for
making
her
remarks
unexceptionable
and
giving
*NL*
them
a
general
bearing
,
that
even
her
whispers
were
loud
and
liable
to
*NL*
sudden
bursts
like
those
of
a
deranged
barrel-organ
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
_
was
_
covetous
,
Jane
,
''
she
replied
;
``
but
I
have
six
children
*NL*
and
have
buried
three
,
and
I
did
n't
marry
into
money
.
The
eldest
,
that
*NL*
sits
there
,
is
but
nineteen
--
so
I
leave
you
to
guess
.
And
stock
always
*NL*
short
,
and
land
most
awkward
.
But
if
ever
I
've
begged
and
prayed
;
it
's
*NL*
been
to
God
above
;
though
where
there
's
one
brother
a
bachelor
and
the
*NL*
other
childless
after
twice
marrying
--
anybody
might
think
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
Mr.
Vincy
had
glanced
at
the
passive
face
of
Mr.
Rigg
,
and
*NL*
had
taken
out
his
snuff-box
and
tapped
it
,
but
had
put
it
again
*NL*
unopened
as
an
indulgence
which
,
however
clarifying
to
the
judgment
,
*NL*
was
unsuited
to
the
occasion
.
``
I
should
n't
wonder
if
Featherstone
had
*NL*
better
feelings
than
any
of
us
gave
him
credit
for
,
''
he
observed
,
in
*NL*
the
ear
of
his
wife
.
``
This
funeral
shows
a
thought
about
everybody
:
it
*NL*
looks
well
when
a
man
wants
to
be
followed
by
his
friends
,
and
if
they
*NL*
are
humble
,
not
to
be
ashamed
of
them
.
I
should
be
all
the
better
*NL*
pleased
if
he
'd
left
lots
of
small
legacies
.
They
may
be
uncommonly
*NL*
useful
to
fellows
in
a
small
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Everything
is
as
handsome
as
could
be
,
crape
and
silk
and
everything
,
''
*NL*
said
Mrs.
Vincy
,
contentedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
am
sorry
to
say
that
Fred
was
under
some
difficulty
in
repressing
*NL*
a
laugh
,
which
would
have
been
more
unsuitable
than
his
father
's
*NL*
snuff-box
.
Fred
had
overheard
Mr.
Jonah
suggesting
something
about
a
*NL*
``
love-child
,
''
and
with
this
thought
in
his
mind
,
the
stranger
's
face
,
*NL*
which
happened
to
be
opposite
him
,
affected
him
too
ludicrously
.
Mary
*NL*
Garth
,
discerning
his
distress
in
the
twitchings
of
his
mouth
,
and
his
*NL*
recourse
to
a
cough
,
came
cleverly
to
his
rescue
by
asking
him
to
*NL*
change
seats
with
her
,
so
that
he
got
into
a
shadowy
corner
.
Fred
was
*NL*
feeling
as
good-naturedly
as
possible
towards
everybody
,
including
*NL*
Rigg
;
and
having
some
relenting
towards
all
these
people
who
were
less
*NL*
lucky
than
he
was
aware
of
being
himself
,
he
would
not
for
the
world
*NL*
have
behaved
amiss
;
still
,
it
was
particularly
easy
to
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
entrance
of
the
lawyer
and
the
two
brothers
drew
every
one
's
*NL*
attention
.
The
lawyer
was
Mr.
Standish
,
and
he
had
come
to
Stone
Court
*NL*
this
morning
believing
that
he
knew
thoroughly
well
who
would
be
*NL*
pleased
and
who
disappointed
before
the
day
was
over
.
The
will
he
*NL*
expected
to
read
was
the
last
of
three
which
he
had
drawn
up
for
Mr.
*NL*
Featherstone
.
Mr.
Standish
was
not
a
man
who
varied
his
manners
:
he
*NL*
behaved
with
the
same
deep-voiced
,
off-hand
civility
to
everybody
,
as
*NL*
if
he
saw
no
difference
in
them
,
and
talked
chiefly
of
the
hay-crop
,
*NL*
which
would
be
``
very
fine
,
by
God
!
''
of
the
last
bulletins
concerning
*NL*
the
King
,
and
of
the
Duke
of
Clarence
,
who
was
a
sailor
every
inch
of
*NL*
him
,
and
just
the
man
to
rule
over
an
island
like
Britain
.
*NL*
*NL*
Old
Featherstone
had
often
reflected
as
he
sat
looking
at
the
fire
that
*NL*
Standish
would
be
surprised
some
day
:
it
is
true
that
if
he
had
done
as
*NL*
he
liked
at
the
last
,
and
burnt
the
will
drawn
up
by
another
lawyer
,
he
*NL*
would
not
have
secured
that
minor
end
;
still
he
had
had
his
pleasure
in
*NL*
ruminating
on
it
.
And
certainly
Mr.
Standish
was
surprised
,
but
not
at
*NL*
all
sorry
;
on
the
contrary
,
he
rather
enjoyed
the
zest
of
a
little
*NL*
curiosity
in
his
own
mind
,
which
the
discovery
of
a
second
will
added
*NL*
to
the
prospective
amazement
on
the
part
of
the
Featherstone
family
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
to
the
sentiments
of
Solomon
and
Jonah
,
they
were
held
in
utter
*NL*
suspense
:
it
seemed
to
them
that
the
old
will
would
have
a
certain
*NL*
validity
,
and
that
there
might
be
such
an
interlacement
of
poor
Peter
's
*NL*
former
and
latter
intentions
as
to
create
endless
``
lawing
''
before
*NL*
anybody
came
by
their
own
--
an
inconvenience
which
would
have
at
least
*NL*
the
advantage
of
going
all
round
.
Hence
the
brothers
showed
a
*NL*
thoroughly
neutral
gravity
as
they
re-entered
with
Mr.
Standish
;
but
*NL*
Solomon
took
out
his
white
handkerchief
again
with
a
sense
that
in
any
*NL*
case
there
would
be
affecting
passages
,
and
crying
at
funerals
,
however
*NL*
dry
,
was
customarily
served
up
in
lawn
.
*NL*
*NL*
Perhaps
the
person
who
felt
the
most
throbbing
excitement
at
this
*NL*
moment
was
Mary
Garth
,
in
the
consciousness
that
it
was
she
who
had
*NL*
virtually
determined
the
production
of
this
second
will
,
which
might
*NL*
have
momentous
effects
on
the
lot
of
some
persons
present
.
No
soul
*NL*
except
herself
knew
what
had
passed
on
that
final
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
will
I
hold
in
my
hand
,
''
said
Mr.
Standish
,
who
,
seated
at
the
*NL*
table
in
the
middle
of
the
room
,
took
his
time
about
everything
,
*NL*
including
the
coughs
with
which
he
showed
a
disposition
to
clear
his
*NL*
voice
,
``
was
drawn
up
by
myself
and
executed
by
our
deceased
friend
on
*NL*
the
9th
of
August
,
1825
.
But
I
find
that
there
is
a
subsequent
*NL*
instrument
hitherto
unknown
to
me
,
bearing
date
the
20th
of
July
,
1826
,
*NL*
hardly
a
year
later
than
the
previous
one
.
And
there
is
farther
,
I
*NL*
see
''
--
Mr.
Standish
was
cautiously
travelling
over
the
document
with
his
*NL*
spectacles
--
``
a
codicil
to
this
latter
will
,
bearing
date
March
1
,
1828
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
,
dear
!
''
said
sister
Martha
,
not
meaning
to
be
audible
,
but
driven
*NL*
to
some
articulation
under
this
pressure
of
dates
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
begin
by
reading
the
earlier
will
,
''
continued
Mr.
Standish
,
*NL*
``
since
such
,
as
appears
by
his
not
having
destroyed
the
document
,
was
*NL*
the
intention
of
deceased
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
preamble
was
felt
to
be
rather
long
,
and
several
besides
Solomon
*NL*
shook
their
heads
pathetically
,
looking
on
the
ground
:
all
eyes
avoided
*NL*
meeting
other
eyes
,
and
were
chiefly
fixed
either
on
the
spots
in
the
*NL*
table-cloth
or
on
Mr.
Standish
's
bald
head
;
excepting
Mary
Garth
's
.
*NL*
When
all
the
rest
were
trying
to
look
nowhere
in
particular
,
it
was
*NL*
safe
for
her
to
look
at
them
.
And
at
the
sound
of
the
first
``
give
and
*NL*
bequeath
''
she
could
see
all
complexions
changing
subtly
,
as
if
some
*NL*
faint
vibration
were
passing
through
them
,
save
that
of
Mr.
Rigg
.
He
*NL*
sat
in
unaltered
calm
,
and
,
in
fact
,
the
company
,
preoccupied
with
more
*NL*
important
problems
,
and
with
the
complication
of
listening
to
bequests
*NL*
which
might
or
might
not
be
revoked
,
had
ceased
to
think
of
him
.
Fred
*NL*
blushed
,
and
Mr.
Vincy
found
it
impossible
to
do
without
his
snuff-box
*NL*
in
his
hand
,
though
he
kept
it
closed
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
small
bequests
came
first
,
and
even
the
recollection
that
there
was
*NL*
another
will
and
that
poor
Peter
might
have
thought
better
of
it
,
could
*NL*
not
quell
the
rising
disgust
and
indignation
.
One
likes
to
be
done
*NL*
well
by
in
every
tense
,
past
,
present
,
and
future
.
And
here
was
Peter
*NL*
capable
five
years
ago
of
leaving
only
two
hundred
apiece
to
his
own
*NL*
brothers
and
sisters
,
and
only
a
hundred
apiece
to
his
own
nephews
and
*NL*
nieces
:
the
Garths
were
not
mentioned
,
but
Mrs.
Vincy
and
Rosamond
were
*NL*
each
to
have
a
hundred
.
Mr.
Trumbull
was
to
have
the
gold-headed
cane
*NL*
and
fifty
pounds
;
the
other
second
cousins
and
the
cousins
present
were
*NL*
each
to
have
the
like
handsome
sum
,
which
,
as
the
saturnine
cousin
*NL*
observed
,
was
a
sort
of
legacy
that
left
a
man
nowhere
;
and
there
was
*NL*
much
more
of
such
offensive
dribbling
in
favor
of
persons
not
*NL*
present
--
problematical
,
and
,
it
was
to
be
feared
,
low
connections
.
*NL*
Altogether
,
reckoning
hastily
,
here
were
about
three
thousand
disposed
of
.
*NL*
Where
then
had
Peter
meant
the
rest
of
the
money
to
go
--
and
where
the
*NL*
land
?
and
what
was
revoked
and
what
not
revoked
--
and
was
the
revocation
*NL*
for
better
or
for
worse
?
All
emotion
must
be
conditional
,
and
might
turn
*NL*
out
to
be
the
wrong
thing
.
The
men
were
strong
enough
to
bear
up
and
*NL*
keep
quiet
under
this
confused
suspense
;
some
letting
their
lower
lip
*NL*
fall
,
others
pursing
it
up
,
according
to
the
habit
of
their
muscles
.
*NL*
But
Jane
and
Martha
sank
under
the
rush
of
questions
,
and
began
to
cry
;
*NL*
poor
Mrs.
Cranch
being
half
moved
with
the
consolation
of
getting
any
*NL*
hundreds
at
all
without
working
for
them
,
and
half
aware
that
her
share
*NL*
was
scanty
;
whereas
Mrs.
Waule
's
mind
was
entirely
flooded
with
the
*NL*
sense
of
being
an
own
sister
and
getting
little
,
while
somebody
else
*NL*
was
to
have
much
.
The
general
expectation
now
was
that
the
``
much
''
*NL*
would
fall
to
Fred
Vincy
,
but
the
Vincys
themselves
were
surprised
when
*NL*
ten
thousand
pounds
in
specified
investments
were
declared
to
be
*NL*
bequeathed
to
him
:
--
was
the
land
coming
too
?
Fred
bit
his
lips
:
it
was
*NL*
difficult
to
help
smiling
,
and
Mrs.
Vincy
felt
herself
the
happiest
of
*NL*
women
--
possible
revocation
shrinking
out
of
sight
in
this
dazzling
*NL*
vision
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
still
a
residue
of
personal
property
as
well
as
the
land
,
but
*NL*
the
whole
was
left
to
one
person
,
and
that
person
was
--
O
*NL*
possibilities
!
O
expectations
founded
on
the
favor
of
``
close
''
old
*NL*
gentlemen
!
O
endless
vocatives
that
would
still
leave
expression
*NL*
slipping
helpless
from
the
measurement
of
mortal
folly
!
--
that
*NL*
residuary
legatee
was
Joshua
Rigg
,
who
was
also
sole
executor
,
and
who
*NL*
was
to
take
thenceforth
the
name
of
Featherstone
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
rustling
which
seemed
like
a
shudder
running
round
the
*NL*
room
.
Every
one
stared
afresh
at
Mr.
Rigg
,
who
apparently
experienced
*NL*
no
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
most
singular
testamentary
disposition
!
''
exclaimed
Mr.
Trumbull
,
*NL*
preferring
for
once
that
he
should
be
considered
ignorant
in
the
past
.
*NL*
``
But
there
is
a
second
will
--
there
is
a
further
document
.
We
have
not
*NL*
yet
heard
the
final
wishes
of
the
deceased
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
Garth
was
feeling
that
what
they
had
yet
to
hear
were
not
the
*NL*
final
wishes
.
The
second
will
revoked
everything
except
the
legacies
*NL*
to
the
low
persons
before
mentioned
-LRB-
some
alterations
in
these
being
*NL*
the
occasion
of
the
codicil
-RRB-
,
and
the
bequest
of
all
the
land
lying
in
*NL*
Lowick
parish
with
all
the
stock
and
household
furniture
,
to
Joshua
*NL*
Rigg
.
The
residue
of
the
property
was
to
be
devoted
to
the
erection
*NL*
and
endowment
of
almshouses
for
old
men
,
to
be
called
Featherstone
's
*NL*
Alms-Houses
,
and
to
be
built
on
a
piece
of
land
near
Middlemarch
*NL*
already
bought
for
the
purpose
by
the
testator
,
he
wishing
--
so
the
*NL*
document
declared
--
to
please
God
Almighty
.
Nobody
present
had
a
*NL*
farthing
;
but
Mr.
Trumbull
had
the
gold-headed
cane
.
It
took
some
time
*NL*
for
the
company
to
recover
the
power
of
expression
.
Mary
dared
not
*NL*
look
at
Fred
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Vincy
was
the
first
to
speak
--
after
using
his
snuff-box
*NL*
energetically
--
and
he
spoke
with
loud
indignation
.
``
The
most
*NL*
unaccountable
will
I
ever
heard
!
I
should
say
he
was
not
in
his
right
*NL*
mind
when
he
made
it
.
I
should
say
this
last
will
was
void
,
''
added
Mr.
*NL*
Vincy
,
feeling
that
this
expression
put
the
thing
in
the
true
light
.
*NL*
``
Eh
Standish
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Our
deceased
friend
always
knew
what
he
was
about
,
I
think
,
''
said
Mr.
*NL*
Standish
.
``
Everything
is
quite
regular
.
Here
is
a
letter
from
*NL*
Clemmens
of
Brassing
tied
with
the
will
.
He
drew

said
Borthrop
Trumbull
,
``
but
I
call
this

will
eccentric

I
was
always
willingly
of
service
to
the

and
*NL*
he
intimated
pretty
plainly
a
sense
of
obligation
which
would
show
*NL*
itself
in
his
will

The
gold-headed
cane
is
farcical
considered
as
an
*NL*
acknowledgment
to
me

happily
I
am
above
mercenary
considerations

Caleb
Garth

``
Anybody
might
have
had
more
reason
for
wondering
if
the
*NL*
will
had
been
what
you
might
expect
from
an
open-minded
straightforward
*NL*
man
.
For
my
part
,
I
wish
there
was
no
such
thing
as
a
will

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
a
strange
sentiment
to
come
from

Christian
man

said
*NL*
the
lawyer
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
said
Caleb
,
leaning
forward
,
adjusting
his
finger-tips
with
*NL*
nicety
and
looking
meditatively
on
the
ground
.
It
always
seemed
to
him
*NL*
that
words
were
the
hardest
part
of
``
business
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
here
Mr.
Jonah
Featherstone
made
himself
heard
.
``
Well
,
he
always
*NL*
was
a
fine
hypocrite
,
was
my
brother
Peter
.
But
this
will
cuts
out
*NL*
everything
.
If
I
'd
known
,
a
wagon
and
six
horses
should
n't
have
drawn
*NL*
me
from

I
'll
put
a

*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear

wept
Mrs.
Cranch

``
and
we
've
been
at
the
expense

that
poor
lad
sitting

long
!
It
's
the
*NL*
first
time
I
ever
heard
my
brother
Peter

so
wishful
to
please
God

Almighty

if

hard

Solomon
,
*NL*
with
a
bitterness
which
was
remarkably
genuine
,
though
his
tone
could
*NL*
not
help
being
sly

impudence

show
it
at

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
all
the

had
got
his

lawful

has
sat
in
church

said
Mrs.
Waule
.
``
And
might
have
left
his

so
respectable

to
them
that

never
been
used

extravagance

unsteadiness
in
no
manner

not
so
poor

what
they

him

things
on

allowed

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

no

Solomon

said
Jonah
.
``
It
never
*NL*
answers

You
'd
better
be

the
*NL*

But
those
above

learn
a

*NL*
``
There
's
more

Solomon

I

it

I
like
Featherstones

brewed
such
,
*NL*
and
not
turned
Featherstones
with
sticking
the
name
on
'em

''
*NL*
*NL*
Solomon
addressed
these
remarks
in
a
loud
aside
to
Mrs.
Waule
as
he
*NL*
rose
to
accompany
her
.
Brother
Jonah
felt
himself
capable
of
much
more
*NL*
stinging
wit
than
this
,
but
he
reflected
that
there
was
no
use
in
*NL*
offending
the
new
proprietor
of
Stone
Court
,
until
you
were
certain
*NL*
that
he
was
quite
without
intentions
of
hospitality
towards
witty
men
*NL*
whose
name
he
was
about
to
bear
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Joshua
Rigg
,
in
fact
,
appeared
to
trouble
himself
little
about
any
*NL*
innuendoes
,
but
showed
a
notable
change
of
manner
,
walking
coolly
up
to
*NL*
Mr.
Standish
and
putting
business
questions
with
much
coolness
.
He
had
*NL*
a
high
chirping
voice
and
a
vile
accent
.
Fred
,
whom
he
no
longer
moved
*NL*
to
laughter
,
thought
him
the
lowest
monster
he
had
ever
seen
.
But
Fred
*NL*
was
feeling
rather
sick
.
The
Middlemarch
mercer
waited
for
an
*NL*
opportunity
of
engaging
Mr.
Rigg
in
conversation
:
there
was
no
knowing
*NL*
how
many
pairs
of
legs
the
new
proprietor
might
require
hose
for
,
and
*NL*
profits
were
more
to
be
relied
on
than
legacies
.
Also
,
the
mercer
,
as
*NL*
a
second
cousin
,
was
dispassionate
enough
to
feel
curiosity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Vincy
,
after
his
one
outburst
,
had
remained
proudly
silent
,
though
*NL*
too
much
preoccupied
with
unpleasant
feelings
to
think
of
moving
,
till
*NL*
he
observed
that
his
wife
had
gone
to
Fred
's
side
and
was
crying
*NL*
silently
while
she
held
her
darling
's
hand
.
He
rose
immediately
,
and
*NL*
turning
his
back
on
the
company
while
he
said
to
her
in
an
*NL*
undertone
,
--
``
Do
n't
give
way
,
Lucy
;
do
n't
make
a
fool
of
yourself
,
my
*NL*
dear
,
before
these
people
,
''
he
added
in
his
usual
loud
voice
--
``
Go
and
*NL*
order
the
phaeton
,
Fred
;
I
have
no
time
to
waste
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
Garth
had
before
this
been
getting
ready
to
go
home
with
her
*NL*
father
.
She
met
Fred
in
the
hall
,
and
now
for
the
first
time
had
the
*NL*
courage
to
look
at
him
.
He
had
that
withered
sort
of
paleness
which
*NL*
will
sometimes
come
on
young
faces
,
and
his
hand
was
very
cold
when
she
*NL*
shook
it
.
Mary
too
was
agitated
;
she
was
conscious
that
fatally
,
*NL*
without
will
of
her
own
,
she
had
perhaps
made
a
great
difference
to
*NL*
Fred
's
lot
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-by
,
''
she
said
,
with
affectionate
sadness
.
``
Be
brave
,
Fred
.
I
do
*NL*
believe
you
are
better
without
the
money
.
What
was
the
good
of
it
to
*NL*
Mr.
Featherstone
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
all
very
fine
,
''
said
Fred
,
pettishly
.
``
What
is
a
fellow
to
do
?
*NL*
I
must
go
into
the
Church
now
.
''
-LRB-
He
knew
that
this
would
vex
Mary
:
*NL*
very
well
;
then
she
must
tell
him
what
else
he
could
do
.
-RRB-
``
And
I
*NL*
thought
I
should
be
able
to
pay
your
father
at
once
and
make
everything
*NL*
right
.
And
you
have
not
even
a
hundred
pounds
left
you
.
What
shall
*NL*
you
do
now
,
Mary
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
another
situation
,
of
course
,
as
soon
as
I
can
get
one
.
My
*NL*
father
has
enough
to
do
to
keep
the
rest
,
without
me
.
Good-by

''
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
very
short
time
Stone
Court
was
cleared
of
well-brewed
*NL*
Featherstones
and
other
long-accustomed
visitors
.
Another
stranger
had
*NL*
been
brought
to
settle
in
the
neighborhood
of
Middlemarch
,
but
in
the
*NL*
case
of
Mr.
Rigg
Featherstone
there
was
more
discontent
with
immediate
*NL*
visible
consequences
than
speculation
as
to
the
effect
which
his
*NL*
presence
might
have
in
the
future
.
No
soul
was
prophetic
enough
to
*NL*
have
any
foreboding
as
to
what
might
appear
on
the
trial
of
Joshua
Rigg
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
here
I
am
naturally
led
to
reflect
on
the
means
of
elevating
a
low
*NL*
subject
.
Historical
parallels
are
remarkably
efficient
in
this
way
.
*NL*
The
chief
objection
to
them
is
,
that
the
diligent
narrator
may
lack
*NL*
space
,
or
-LRB-
what
is
often
the
same
thing
-RRB-
may
not
be
able
to
think
of
*NL*
them
with
any
degree
of
particularity
,
though
he
may
have
a
*NL*
philosophical
confidence
that
if
known
they
would
be
illustrative
.
It
*NL*
seems
an
easier
and
shorter
way
to
dignity
,
to
observe
that
--
since
*NL*
there
never
was
a
true
story
which
could
not
be
told
in
parables
,
where
*NL*
you
might
put
a
monkey
for
a
margrave
,
and
vice
versa
--
whatever
has
*NL*
been
or
is
to
be
narrated
by
me
about
low
people
,
may
be
ennobled
by
*NL*
being
considered
a
parable
;
so
that
if
any
bad
habits
and
ugly
*NL*
consequences
are
brought
into
view
,
the
reader
may
have
the
relief
of
*NL*
regarding
them
as
not
more
than
figuratively
ungenteel
,
and
may
feel
*NL*
himself
virtually
in
company
with
persons
of
some
style
.
Thus
while
I
*NL*
tell
the
truth
about
loobies
,
my
reader
's
imagination
need
not
be
*NL*
entirely
excluded
from
an
occupation
with
lords
;
and
the
petty
sums
*NL*
which
any
bankrupt
of
high
standing
would
be
sorry
to
retire
upon
,
may
*NL*
be
lifted
to
the
level
of
high
commercial
transactions
by
the
*NL*
inexpensive
addition
of
proportional
ciphers
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
to
any
provincial
history
in
which
the
agents
are
all
of
high
moral
*NL*
rank
,
that
must
be
of
a
date
long
posterior
to
the
first
Reform
Bill
,
*NL*
and
Peter
Featherstone
,
you
perceive
,
was
dead
and
buried
some
months
*NL*
before
Lord
Grey
came
into
office

DANIEL
:
Tragedy
of
Philotas
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Vincy
went
home
from
the
reading
of
the
will
with
his
point
of
view
*NL*
considerably
changed
in
relation
to
many
subjects
.
He
was
an
*NL*
open-minded
man
,
but
given
to
indirect
modes
of
expressing
himself
:
*NL*
when
he
was
disappointed
in
a
market
for
his
silk
braids
,
he
swore
at
*NL*
the
groom
;
when
his
brother-in-law
Bulstrode
had
vexed
him
,
he
made
*NL*
cutting
remarks
on
Methodism
;
and
it
was
now
apparent
that
he
regarded
*NL*
Fred
's
idleness
with
a
sudden
increase
of
severity
,
by
his
throwing
an
*NL*
embroidered
cap
out
of
the
smoking-room
on
to
the
hall-floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
sir
,
''
he
observed
,
when
that
young
gentleman
was
moving
off
to
*NL*
bed
,
``
I
hope
you
've
made
up
your
mind
now
to
go
up
next
term
and
pass
*NL*
your
examination
.
I
've
taken
my
resolution
,
so
I
advise
you
to
lose
no
*NL*
time
in
taking
yours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fred
made
no
answer
:
he
was
too
utterly
depressed
.
Twenty-four
hours
*NL*
ago
he
had
thought
that
instead
of
needing
to
know
what
he
should
do
,
*NL*
he
should
by
this
time
know
that
he
needed
to
do
nothing
:
that
he
*NL*
should
hunt
in
pink
,
have
a
first-rate
hunter
,
ride
to
cover
on
a
fine
*NL*
hack
,
and
be
generally
respected
for
doing
so
;
moreover
,
that
he
should
*NL*
be
able
at
once
to
pay
Mr.
Garth
,
and
that
Mary
could
no
longer
have
*NL*
any
reason
for
not
marrying
him
.
And
all
this
was
to
have
come
without
*NL*
study
or
other
inconvenience
,
purely
by
the
favor
of
providence
in
the
*NL*
shape
of
an
old
gentleman
's
caprice
.
But
now
,
at
the
end
of
the
*NL*
twenty-four
hours
,
all
those
firm
expectations
were
upset
.
It
was
*NL*
``
rather
hard
lines
''
that
while
he
was
smarting
under
this
*NL*
disappointment
he
should
be
treated
as
if
he
could
have
helped
it
.
But
*NL*
he
went
away
silently
and
his
mother
pleaded
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
be
hard
on
the
poor
boy
,
Vincy
.
He
'll
turn
out
well
yet
,
though
*NL*
that
wicked
man
has
deceived
him
.
I
feel
as
sure
as
I
sit
here
,
Fred
*NL*
will
turn
out
well
--
else
why
was
he
brought
back
from
the
brink
of
the
*NL*
grave
?
And
I
call
it
a
robbery
:
it
was
like
giving
him
the
land
,
to
*NL*
promise
it
;
and
what
is
promising
,
if
making
everybody
believe
is
not
*NL*
promising
?
And
you
see
he
did
leave
him
ten
thousand
pounds
,
and
then
*NL*
took
it
away
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Took
it
away
again

Mr.

pettishly

Mrs.
Vincy
,
easily
*NL*
recovering
her
cheerful
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
knows
what
babies
will
turn
to
?
I
was
fool
enough
,
I
dare
say
,
''
*NL*
said
the
husband
--
more
mildly
,
however
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
who
has
handsomer
,
better
children
than
ours
?
Fred
is
far
beyond
*NL*
other
people
's
sons
:
you
may
hear
it
in
his
speech
,
that
he
has
kept
*NL*
college
company
.
And
Rosamond
--
where
is
there
a
girl
like
her
?
She
*NL*
might
stand
beside
any
lady
in
the
land
,
and
only
look
the
better
for
*NL*
it
.
You
see
--
Mr.
Lydgate
has
kept
the
highest
company
and
been
*NL*
everywhere
,
and
he
fell
in
love
with
her
at
once
.
Not
but
what
I
could
*NL*
have
wished
Rosamond
had
not
engaged
herself
.
She
might
have
met
*NL*
somebody
on
a
visit
who
would
have
been
a
far
better
match
;
I
mean
at
*NL*
her
schoolfellow
Miss
Willoughby
's
.
There
are
relations
in
that
family
*NL*
quite
as
high
as
Mr.
Lydgate
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Damn
relations
!
''
said
Mr.
Vincy
;
``
I
've
had
enough
of
them
.
I
do
n't
*NL*
want
a
son-in-law
who
has
got
nothing
but
his
relations
to
recommend
*NL*
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
my
dear
,
''
said
Mrs.
Vincy
,
``
you
seemed
as
pleased
as
could
be
*NL*
about
it
.
It
's
true
,
I
was
n't
at
home
;
but
Rosamond
told
me
you
had
n't
*NL*
a
word
to
say
against
the
engagement
.
And
she
has
begun
to
buy
in
the
*NL*
best
linen
and
cambric
for
her
underclothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
by
my
will

''
said
Mr.
Vincy
.
``
I
shall
have
enough
to
do
this
*NL*
year
,
with
an
idle
scamp
of
a
son
,
without
paying
for
wedding-clothes
.
*NL*
The
times
are
as
tight
as
can
be
;
everybody
is
being
ruined
;
and
I
*NL*
do
n't
believe
Lydgate
has
got
a
farthing
.
I
sha
n't
give
my
consent
to
*NL*
their
marrying

Let
'em
wait

their
elders
have
done
before
'em
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Rosamond
will
take
it
hard

Vincy

know
you
never
could
bear
*NL*
to
cross
her

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
could

The
sooner
the
engagement
's
off

the
better

do

he
'll
ever
make
an
income

the
way

goes
on

makes

enemies

that
's
all
I
hear
of
his
making

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
he
stands
very
high
with
Mr.
Bulstrode

I
should
think

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
Mr.
Vincy
.

thinks
I

going

to
set
up
*NL*
housekeeping
,
he
's
mistaken

that
's
all

I
expect
I
shall
have
to
put
*NL*
down
my
horses
soon
.
You
'd
better
tell
Rosy
what
I
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
a
not
infrequent
procedure
with
Mr.
Vincy
--
to
be
rash
in
*NL*
jovial
assent
,
and
on
becoming
subsequently
conscious
that
he
had
been
*NL*
rash
,
to
employ
others
in
making
the
offensive
retractation
.
However
,
*NL*
Mrs.
Vincy
,
who
never
willingly
opposed
her
husband
,
lost
no
time
the
*NL*
next
morning
in
letting
Rosamond
know
what
he
had
said
.
Rosamond
,
*NL*
examining
some
muslin-work
,
listened
in
silence
,
and
at
the
end
gave
a
*NL*
certain
turn
of
her
graceful
neck
,
of
which
only
long
experience
could
*NL*
teach
you
that
it
meant
perfect
obstinacy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
say
,
my
dear
?
''
said
her
mother
,
with
affectionate
*NL*
deference
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Papa
does
not
mean
anything
of
the
kind
,
''
said
Rosamond
,
quite
calmly
.
*NL*
``
He
has
always
said
that
he
wished
me
to
marry
the
man
I
loved
.
And
I
*NL*
shall
marry
Mr.
Lydgate
.
It
is
seven
weeks
now
since
papa
gave
his
*NL*
consent
.
And
I
hope
we
shall
have
Mrs.
Bretton
's
house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
my
dear
,
I
shall
leave
you

manage
your
papa

You
always
do

manage
everybody

But
if
we
ever
do
go
and
get
damask
,
Sadler
's
is
the
*NL*
place
--
far
better
than
Hopkins
's
.
Mrs.
Bretton
's
is
very
large
,
though
:
*NL*
I
should
love
you
to
have
such
a
house
;
but
it
will
take
a
great
deal
*NL*
of
furniture
--
carpeting
and
everything
,
besides
plate
and
glass
.
And
*NL*
you
hear
,
your
papa
says
he
will
give
no
money

Do
you
think
Mr.
*NL*
Lydgate
expects
it
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
not
imagine
that
I
should
ask
him

Of
course

understands

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
he
may
have
been
looking
for
money

my

we
all
thought
of

your
having
a
pretty
legacy
as
well
as
Fred
;
--
and
now
everything
is
so
*NL*
dreadful

there
's
no
pleasure
in
thinking
of
anything
,
with
that
poor
*NL*
boy
disappointed
as
he
is

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
has
nothing
to
do
with
my

Fred
must
leave
off

being
idle

I
am
going
up-stairs
to
take
this
work
to
Miss
Morgan
:
she
*NL*
does
the
open
hemming
very
well
.
Mary
Garth
might
do
some
work
for

now

I
should
think

Her
sewing
is
exquisite

it
is
the
nicest
thing
I

know
about
Mary

I
should
so
like
to
have
all
my
cambric
frilling
*NL*
double-hemmed
.
And
it
takes
a
long
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Vincy
's
belief
that
Rosamond
could
manage
her
papa
was
well
*NL*
founded
.
Apart
from
his
dinners
and
his
coursing
,
Mr.
Vincy
,
*NL*
blustering
as
he
was
,
had
as
little
of
his
own
way
as
if
he
had
been
a
*NL*
prime
minister
:
the
force
of
circumstances
was
easily
too
much
for
him
,
*NL*
as
it
is
for
most
pleasure-loving
florid
men
;
and
the
circumstance
*NL*
called
Rosamond
was
particularly
forcible
by
means
of
that
mild
*NL*
persistence
which
,
as
we
know
,
enables
a
white
soft
living
substance
to
*NL*
make
its
way
in
spite
of
opposing
rock
.
Papa
was
not
a
rock
:
he
had
no
*NL*
other
fixity
than
that
fixity
of
alternating
impulses
sometimes
called
*NL*
habit
,
and
this
was
altogether
unfavorable
to
his
taking
the
only
*NL*
decisive
line
of
conduct
in
relation
to
his
daughter
's
*NL*
engagement
--
namely
,
to
inquire
thoroughly
into
Lydgate
's
circumstances
,
*NL*
declare
his
own
inability
to
furnish
money
,
and
forbid
alike
either
a
*NL*
speedy
marriage
or
an
engagement
which
must
be
too
lengthy
.
That
seems
*NL*
very
simple
and
easy
in
the
statement
;
but
a
disagreeable
resolve
*NL*
formed
in
the
chill
hours
of
the
morning
had
as
many
conditions
against
*NL*
it
as
the
early
frost
,
and
rarely
persisted
under
the
warming
*NL*
influences
of
the
day
.
The
indirect
though
emphatic
expression
of
*NL*
opinion
to
which
Mr.
Vincy
was
prone
suffered
much
restraint
in
this
*NL*
case
:
Lydgate
was
a
proud
man
towards
whom
innuendoes
were
obviously
*NL*
unsafe
,
and
throwing
his
hat
on
the
floor
was
out
of
the
question
.
Mr.
*NL*
Vincy
was
a
little
in
awe
of
him
,
a
little
vain
that
he
wanted
to
marry
*NL*
Rosamond
,
a
little
indisposed
to
raise
a
question
of
money
in
which
his
*NL*
own
position
was
not
advantageous
,
a
little
afraid
of
being
worsted
in
*NL*
dialogue
with
a
man
better
educated
and
more
highly
bred
than
himself
,
*NL*
and
a
little
afraid
of
doing
what
his
daughter
would
not
like
.
The
*NL*
part
Mr.
Vincy
preferred
playing
was
that
of
the
generous
host
whom
*NL*
nobody
criticises
.
In
the
earlier
half
of
the
day
there
was
business
*NL*
to
hinder
any
formal
communication
of
an
adverse
resolve
;
in
the
later
*NL*
there
was
dinner
,
wine
,
whist
,
and
general
satisfaction
.
And
in
the
*NL*
mean
while
the
hours
were
each
leaving
their
little
deposit
and
*NL*
gradually
forming
the
final
reason
for
inaction
,
namely
,
that
action
*NL*
was
too
late
.
The
accepted
lover
spent
most
of
his
evenings
in
Lowick
*NL*
Gate
,
and
a
love-making
not
at
all
dependent
on
money-advances
from
*NL*
fathers-in-law
,
or
prospective
income
from
a
profession
,
went
on
*NL*
flourishingly
under
Mr.
Vincy
's
own
eyes
.
Young
love-making
--
that
*NL*
gossamer
web
!
Even
the
points
it
clings
to
--
the
things
whence
its
*NL*
subtle
interlacings
are
swung
--
are
scarcely
perceptible
:
momentary
*NL*
touches
of
fingertips
,
meetings
of
rays
from
blue
and
dark
orbs
,
*NL*
unfinished
phrases
,
lightest
changes
of
cheek
and
lip
,
faintest
*NL*
tremors
.
The
web
itself
is
made
of
spontaneous
beliefs
and
indefinable
*NL*
joys
,
yearnings
of
one
life
towards
another
,
visions
of
completeness
,
*NL*
indefinite
trust
.
And
Lydgate
fell
to
spinning
that
web
from
his
*NL*
inward
self
with
wonderful
rapidity
,
in
spite
of
experience
supposed
to
*NL*
be
finished
off
with
the
drama
of
Laure
--
in
spite
too
of
medicine
and
*NL*
biology
;
for
the
inspection
of
macerated
muscle
or
of
eyes
presented
in
*NL*
a
dish
-LRB-
like
Santa
Lucia
's
-RRB-
,
and
other
incidents
of
scientific
inquiry
,
*NL*
are
observed
to
be
less
incompatible
with
poetic
love
than
a
native
*NL*
dulness
or
a
lively
addiction
to
the
lowest
prose
.
As
for
Rosamond
,
*NL*
she
was
in
the
water-lily
's
expanding
wonderment
at
its
own
fuller
*NL*
life
,
and
she
too
was
spinning
industriously
at
the
mutual
web
.
All
*NL*
this
went
on
in
the
corner
of
the
drawing-room
where
the
piano
stood
,
*NL*
and
subtle
as
it
was
,
the
light
made
it
a
sort
of
rainbow
visible
to
*NL*
many
observers
besides
Mr.
Farebrother
.
The
certainty
that
Miss
Vincy
*NL*
and
Mr.
Lydgate
were
engaged
became
general
in
Middlemarch
without
the
*NL*
aid
of
formal
announcement
.
*NL*
*NL*
Aunt
Bulstrode
was
again
stirred
to
anxiety
;
but
this
time
she
*NL*
addressed
herself
to
her
brother
,
going
to
the
warehouse
expressly
to
*NL*
avoid
Mrs.
Vincy
's
volatility
.
His
replies
were
not
satisfactory
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Walter
,
you
never
mean
to
tell
me
that
you
have
allowed
all
this
to
go
*NL*
on
without
inquiry
into
Mr.
Lydgate
's
prospects
?
''
said
Mrs.
Bulstrode
,
*NL*
opening
her
eyes
with
wider
gravity
at
her
brother
,
who
was
in
his
*NL*
peevish
warehouse
humor
.
``
Think
of
this
girl
brought
up
in
luxury
--
in
*NL*
too
worldly
a
way
,
I
am
sorry
to
say
--
what
will
she
do
on
a
small
*NL*
income
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
confound
it
,
Harriet
!
What
can
I
do
when
men
come
into
the
town

any
asking
of
mine
?
Did
you
shut
your
house
up
against
*NL*
Lydgate
?
Bulstrode
has
pushed
him
forward
more
than
anybody
.
I
never
*NL*
made
any
fuss
about
the
young
fellow
.
You
should
go
and
talk
to
your
*NL*
husband
about
it

not
me

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
really
,
Walter
,
how
can
Mr.
Bulstrode
be
to
blame

am
sure

did
not
wish
for
the
engagement

*NL*
*NL*
``

had
not
taken
him
by

hand

should
never
have

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
called
him
in
to
attend
on
Fred

I
am
sure
that
was
a
*NL*
mercy

said
Mrs.
Bulstrode
,
losing
her
clew
in
the
intricacies
of
the
*NL*
subject
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
about
mercy

said
Mr.
Vincy
,
testily
.
``
I
know
I
am
*NL*
worried
more
than
I
like
with
my
family
.
I
was
a
good
brother
to
you
,
*NL*
Harriet
,
before
you
married
Bulstrode
,
and
I
must
say
he
does
n't
always
*NL*
show
that
friendly
spirit
towards
your
family
that
might
have
been
*NL*
expected
of
him
.
''
Mr.
Vincy
was
very
little
like
a
Jesuit
,
but
no
*NL*
accomplished
Jesuit
could
have
turned
a
question
more
adroitly
.
*NL*
Harriet
had
to
defend
her
husband
instead
of
blaming
her
brother
,
and
*NL*
the
conversation
ended
at
a
point
as
far
from
the
beginning
as
some
*NL*
recent
sparring
between
the
brothers-in-law
at
a
vestry
meeting
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Bulstrode
did
not
repeat
her
brother
's
complaints
to
her
husband
,
*NL*
but
in
the
evening
she
spoke
to
him
of
Lydgate
and
Rosamond
.
He
did
*NL*
not
share
her
warm
interest
,
however
;
and
only
spoke
with
resignation
*NL*
of
the
risks
attendant
on
the
beginning
of
medical
practice
and
the
*NL*
desirability
of
prudence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sure
we
are
bound
to
pray
for
that
thoughtless
girl
--
brought
up
*NL*
as
she
has
been

''
said
Mrs.
Bulstrode
,
wishing
to
rouse
her
husband
's
*NL*
feelings
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Truly
,
my
dear

said
Mr.
Bulstrode
,
assentingly
.
``
Those
who
are
not
*NL*
of
this
world

do
little
else
to
arrest
the
errors

worldly
.
That
is
what
we
must
accustom
ourselves
to
*NL*
recognize
with
regard
to
your
brother
's
family
.
I
could
have
wished
*NL*
that
Mr.
Lydgate
had
not
entered
into
such
a
union
;
but
my
relations
*NL*
with
him
are
limited
to
that
use
of
his
gifts
for
God
's
purposes
which
*NL*
is
taught
us
by
the
divine
government
under
each
dispensation

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Bulstrode
said
no
more
,
attributing
some
dissatisfaction
which
she
*NL*
felt
to
her
own
want
of
spirituality
.
She
believed
that
her
husband
*NL*
was
one
of
those
men
whose
memoirs
should
be
written
when
they
died
.
*NL*
*NL*

to
Lydgate
himself
,
having
been
accepted
,
he
was
prepared
to
accept
*NL*
all
the
consequences
which
he
believed
himself
to
foresee
with
perfect
*NL*
clearness
.
Of
course
he
must
be
married
in
a
year
--
perhaps
even
in
*NL*
half
a
year
.
This
was
not
what
he
had
intended
;
but
other
schemes
*NL*
would
not
be
hindered
:
they
would
simply
adjust
themselves
anew
.
*NL*
Marriage
,
of
course
,
must
be
prepared
for
in
the
usual
way
.
A
house
*NL*
must
be
taken
instead
of
the
rooms
he
at
present
occupied
;
and
Lydgate
,
*NL*
having
heard
Rosamond
speak
with
admiration
of
old
Mrs.
Bretton
's
house
*NL*
-LRB-
situated
in
Lowick
Gate
-RRB-
,
took
notice
when
it
fell
vacant
after
the
*NL*
old
lady
's
death
,
and
immediately
entered
into
treaty
for
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
this
in
an
episodic
way
,
very
much
as
he
gave
orders
to
his
*NL*
tailor
for
every
requisite
of
perfect
dress
,
without
any
notion
of
*NL*
being
extravagant
.
On
the
contrary
,
he
would
have
despised
any
*NL*
ostentation
of
expense
;
his
profession
had
familiarized
him
with
all
*NL*
grades
of
poverty
,
and
he
cared
much
for
those
who
suffered
hardships
.
*NL*
He
would
have
behaved
perfectly
at
a
table
where
the
sauce
was
served
*NL*
in
a
jug
with
the
handle
off
,
and
he
would
have
remembered
nothing
*NL*
about
a
grand
dinner
except
that
a
man
was
there
who
talked
well
.
But
*NL*
it
had
never
occurred
to
him
that
he
should
live
in
any
other
than
what
*NL*
he
would
have
called
an
ordinary
way
,
with
green
glasses
for
hock
,
and
*NL*
excellent
waiting
at
table
.
In
warming
himself
at
French
social
*NL*
theories
he
had
brought
away
no
smell
of
scorching
.
We
may
handle
even
*NL*
extreme
opinions
with
impunity
while
our
furniture
,
our
dinner-giving
,
*NL*
and
preference
for
armorial
bearings
in
our
own
case
,
link
us
*NL*
indissolubly
with
the
established
order
.
And
Lydgate
's
tendency
was
*NL*
not
towards
extreme
opinions
:
he
would
have
liked
no
barefooted
*NL*
doctrines
,
being
particular
about
his
boots
:
he
was
no
radical
in
*NL*
relation
to
anything
but
medical
reform
and
the
prosecution
of
*NL*
discovery
.
In
the
rest
of
practical
life
he
walked
by
hereditary
*NL*
habit
;
half
from
that
personal
pride
and
unreflecting
egoism
which
I
*NL*
have
already
called
commonness
,
and
half
from
that
naivete
which
*NL*
belonged
to
preoccupation
with
favorite
ideas
.
*NL*
*NL*
Any
inward
debate
Lydgate
had
as
to
the
consequences
of
this
engagement
*NL*
which
had
stolen
upon
him
,
turned
on
the
paucity
of
time
rather
than
of
*NL*
money
.
Certainly
,
being
in
love
and
being
expected
continually
by
some
*NL*
one
who
always
turned
out
to
be
prettier
than
memory
could
represent
*NL*
her
to
be
,
did
interfere
with
the
diligent
use
of
spare
hours
which
*NL*
might
serve
some
``
plodding
fellow
of
a
German
''
to
make
the
great
,
*NL*
imminent
discovery
.
This
was
really
an
argument
for
not
deferring
the
*NL*
marriage
too
long
,
as
he
implied
to
Mr.
Farebrother
,
one
day
that
the
*NL*
Vicar
came
to
his
room
with
some
pond-products
which
he
wanted
to
*NL*
examine
under
a
better
microscope
than
his
own
,
and
,
finding
Lydgate
's
*NL*
tableful
of
apparatus
and
specimens
in
confusion
,
said
sarcastically
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eros
has
degenerated
;
he
began
by
introducing
order
and
harmony
,
and
*NL*
now
he
brings
back
chaos
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
at
some
stages
,
''
said
Lydgate
,
lifting
his
brows
and
smiling
,
*NL*
while
he
began
to
arrange
his
microscope
.
``
But
a
better
order
will
*NL*
begin
after
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Soon
?
''
said
the
Vicar
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
so
,
really
.
This
unsettled
state
of
affairs
uses
up
the
time
,
*NL*
and
when
one
has
notions
in
science
,
every
moment
is
an
opportunity
.
I
*NL*
feel
sure
that
marriage
must
be
the
best
thing
for
a
man
who
wants
to
*NL*
work
steadily
.
He
has
everything
at
home
then
--
no
teasing
with
*NL*
personal
speculations
--
he
can
get
calmness
and
freedom
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
an
enviable
dog
,
''
said
the
Vicar
,
``
to
have
such
a
*NL*
prospect
--
Rosamond
,
calmness
and
freedom
,
all
to
your
share
.
Here
am
*NL*
I
with
nothing
but
my
pipe
and
pond-animalcules
.
Now
,
are
you
ready
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lydgate
did
not
mention
to
the
Vicar
another
reason
he
had
for
wishing
*NL*
to
shorten
the
period
of
courtship
.
It
was
rather
irritating
to
him
,
*NL*
even
with
the
wine
of
love
in
his
veins
,
to
be
obliged
to
mingle
so
*NL*
often
with
the
family
party
at
the
Vincys
'
,
and
to
enter
so
much
into
*NL*
Middlemarch
gossip
,
protracted
good
cheer
,
whist-playing
,
and
general
*NL*
futility
.
He
had
to
be
deferential
when
Mr.
Vincy
decided
questions
*NL*
with
trenchant
ignorance
,
especially
as
to
those
liquors
which
were
the
*NL*
best
inward
pickle
,
preserving
you
from
the
effects
of
bad
air
.
Mrs.
*NL*
Vincy
's
openness
and
simplicity
were
quite
unstreaked
with
suspicion
as
*NL*
to
the
subtle
offence
she
might
give
to
the
taste
of
her
intended
*NL*
son-in-law
;
and
altogether
Lydgate
had
to
confess
to
himself
that
he
*NL*
was
descending
a
little
in
relation
to
Rosamond
's
family
.
But
that
*NL*
exquisite
creature
herself
suffered
in
the
same
sort
of
way
:
--
it
was
*NL*
at
least
one
delightful
thought
that
in
marrying
her
,
he
could
give
her
*NL*
a
much-needed
transplantation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
!
''
he
said
to
her
one
evening
,
in
his
gentlest
tone
,
as
he
sat
*NL*
down
by
her
and
looked
closely
at
her
face
--
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
must
first
say
that
he
had
found
her
alone
in
the
drawing-room
,
*NL*
where
the
great
old-fashioned
window
,
almost
as
large
as
the
side
of
*NL*
the
room
,
was
opened
to
the
summer
scents
of
the
garden
at
the
back
of
*NL*
the
house
.
Her
father
and
mother
were
gone
to
a
party
,
and
the
rest
*NL*
were
all
out
with
the
butterflies
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
!
your
eyelids
are
red
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
they
?
''
said
Rosamond
.
``
I
wonder
why
.
''
It
was
not
in
her
nature
*NL*
to
pour
forth
wishes
or
grievances
.
They
only
came
forth
gracefully
on
*NL*
solicitation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
if
you
could
hide
it
from
me
!
''
said
Lydgate
,
laying
his
hand
*NL*
tenderly
on
both
of
hers
.
``
Do
n't
I
see
a
tiny
drop
on
one
of
the
*NL*
lashes
?
Things
trouble
you
,
and
you
do
n't
tell
me
.
That
is
unloving
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
should
I
tell
you
what
you
can
not
alter
?
They
are
every-day
*NL*
things
:
--
perhaps
they
have
been
a
little
worse
lately
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Family
annoyances
.
Do
n't
fear
speaking
.
I
guess
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Papa
has
been
more
irritable
lately
.
Fred
makes
him
angry
,
and
this
*NL*
morning
there
was
a
fresh
quarrel
because
Fred
threatens
to
throw
his
*NL*
whole
education
away
,
and
do
something
quite
beneath
him
.
And
*NL*
besides
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Rosamond
hesitated
,
and
her
cheeks
were
gathering
a
slight
flush
.
*NL*
Lydgate
had
never
seen
her
in
trouble
since
the
morning
of
their
*NL*
engagement
,
and
he
had
never
felt
so
passionately
towards
her
as
at
*NL*
this
moment
.
He
kissed
the
hesitating
lips
gently
,
as
if
to
encourage
*NL*
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
feel
that
papa
is
not
quite
pleased
about
our
engagement
,
''
Rosamond
*NL*
continued
,
almost
in
a
whisper
;
``
and
he
said
last
night
that
he
should
*NL*
certainly
speak
to
you
and
say
it
must
be
given
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
give
it
up
?
''
said
Lydgate
,
with
quick
energy
--
almost
angrily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
give
up
anything
that
I
choose
to
do
,
''
said
Rosamond
,
*NL*
recovering
her
calmness
at
the
touching
of
this
chord
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
bless
you
!
''
said
Lydgate
,
kissing
her
again
.
This
constancy
of
*NL*
purpose
in
the
right
place
was
adorable
.
He
went
on
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
too
late
now
for
your
father
to
say
that
our
engagement
must
be
*NL*
given
up
.
You
are
of
age
,
and
I
claim
you
as
mine
.
If
anything
is
*NL*
done
to
make
you
unhappy
,
--
that
is
a
reason
for
hastening
our
marriage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
An
unmistakable
delight
shone
forth
from
the
blue
eyes
that
met
his
,
*NL*
and
the
radiance
seemed
to
light
up
all
his
future
with
mild
sunshine
.
*NL*
Ideal
happiness
-LRB-
of
the
kind
known
in
the
Arabian
Nights
,
in
which
you
*NL*
are
invited
to
step
from
the
labor
and
discord
of
the
street
into
a
*NL*
paradise
where
everything
is
given
to
you
and
nothing
claimed
-RRB-
seemed
*NL*
to
be
an
affair
of
a
few
weeks
'
waiting
,
more
or
less
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
should
we
defer
it
?
''
he
said
,
with
ardent
insistence
.
``
I
have
*NL*
taken
the
house
now
:
everything
else
can
soon
be
got
ready
--
can
it
*NL*
not
?
You
will
not
mind
about
new
clothes
.
Those
can
be
bought
*NL*
afterwards
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
original
notions
you
clever
men
have
!
''
said
Rosamond
,
dimpling
*NL*
with
more
thorough
laughter
than
usual
at
this
humorous
incongruity
.
*NL*
``
This
is
the
first
time
I
ever
heard
of
wedding-clothes
being
bought
*NL*
after
marriage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
do
n't
mean
to
say
you
would
insist
on
my
waiting
months
for
*NL*
the
sake
of
clothes
?
''
said
Lydgate
,
half
thinking
that
Rosamond
was
*NL*
tormenting
him
prettily
,
and
half
fearing
that
she
really
shrank
from
*NL*
speedy
marriage
.
``
Remember
,
we
are
looking
forward
to
a
better
sort
of
*NL*
happiness
even
than
this
--
being
continually
together
,
independent
of
*NL*
others
,
and
ordering
our
lives
as
we
will
.
Come
,
dear
,
tell
me
how
*NL*
soon
you
can
be
altogether
mine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
serious
pleading
in
Lydgate
's
tone
,
as
if
he
felt
that
she
*NL*
would
be
injuring
him
by
any
fantastic
delays
.
Rosamond
became
serious
*NL*
too
,
and
slightly
meditative
;
in
fact
,
she
was
going
through
many
*NL*
intricacies
of
lace-edging
and
hosiery
and
petticoat-tucking
,
in
order
*NL*
to
give
an
answer
that
would
at
least
be
approximative
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Six
weeks
would
be
ample
--
say
so
,
Rosamond
,
''
insisted
Lydgate
,
*NL*
releasing
her
hands
to
put
his
arm
gently
round
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
little
hand
immediately
went
to
pat
her
hair
,
while
she
gave
her
*NL*
neck
a
meditative
turn
,
and
then
said
seriously
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
would
be
the
house-linen
and
the
furniture
to
be
prepared
.
*NL*
Still
,
mamma
could
see
to
those
while
we
were
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
to
be
sure
.
We
must
be
away
a
week
or
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
more
than
that
!
''
said
Rosamond
,
earnestly
.
She
was
thinking
of
*NL*
her
evening
dresses
for
the
visit
to
Sir
Godwin
Lydgate
's
,
which
she
*NL*
had
long
been
secretly
hoping
for
as
a
delightful
employment
of
at
*NL*
least
one
quarter
of
the
honeymoon
,
even
if
she
deferred
her
*NL*
introduction
to
the
uncle
who
was
a
doctor
of
divinity
-LRB-
also
a
pleasing
*NL*
though
sober
kind
of
rank
,
when
sustained
by
blood
-RRB-
.
She
looked
at
her
*NL*
lover
with
some
wondering
remonstrance
as
she
spoke
,
and
he
readily
*NL*
understood
that
she
might
wish
to
lengthen
the
sweet
time
of
double
*NL*
solitude
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whatever
you
wish
,
my
darling
,
when
the
day
is
fixed
.
But
let
us
take
*NL*
a
decided
course
,
and
put
an
end
to
any
discomfort
you
may
be
*NL*
suffering
.
Six
weeks
!
--
I
am
sure
they
would
be
ample
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
certainly
hasten
the
work
,
''
said
Rosamond
.
``
Will
you
,
then
,
*NL*
mention
it
to
papa
?
--
I
think
it
would
be
better
to
write
to
him
.
''
She
*NL*
blushed
and
looked
at
him
as
the
garden
flowers
look
at
us
when
we
walk
*NL*
forth
happily
among
them
in
the
transcendent
evening
light
:
is
there
*NL*
not
a
soul
beyond
utterance
,
half
nymph
,
half
child
,
in
those
delicate
*NL*
petals
which
glow
and
breathe
about
the
centres
of
deep
color
?
*NL*
*NL*
He
touched
her
ear
and
a
little
bit
of
neck
under
it
with
his
lips
,
and
*NL*
they
sat
quite
still
for
many
minutes
which
flowed
by
them
like
a
small
*NL*
gurgling
brook
with
the
kisses
of
the
sun
upon
it
.
Rosamond
thought
*NL*
that
no
one
could
be
more
in
love
than
she
was
;
and
Lydgate
thought
*NL*
that
after
all
his
wild
mistakes
and
absurd
credulity
,
he
had
found
*NL*
perfect
womanhood
--
felt
as
if
already
breathed
upon
by
exquisite
wedded
*NL*
affection
such
as
would
be
bestowed
by
an
accomplished
creature
who
*NL*
venerated
his
high
musings
and
momentous
labors
and
would
never
*NL*
interfere
with
them
;
who
would
create
order
in
the
home
and
accounts
*NL*
with
still
magic
,
yet
keep
her
fingers
ready
to
touch
the
lute
and
*NL*
transform
life
into
romance
at
any
moment
;
who
was
instructed
to
the
*NL*
true
womanly
limit
and
not
a
hair
's
-
breadth
beyond
--
docile
,
therefore
,
*NL*
and
ready
to
carry
out
behests
which
came
from
that
limit
.
It
was
*NL*
plainer
now
than
ever
that
his
notion
of
remaining
much
longer
a
*NL*
bachelor
had
been
a
mistake
:
marriage
would
not
be
an
obstruction
but
a
*NL*
furtherance
.
And
happening
the
next
day
to
accompany
a
patient
to
*NL*
Brassing
,
he
saw
a
dinner-service
there
which
struck
him
as
so
exactly
*NL*
the
right
thing
that
he
bought
it
at
once
.
It
saved
time
to
do
these
*NL*
things
just
when
you
thought
of
them
,
and
Lydgate
hated
ugly
crockery
.
*NL*
The
dinner-service
in
question
was
expensive
,
but
that
might
be
in
the
*NL*
nature
of
dinner-services
.
Furnishing
was
necessarily
expensive
;
but
*NL*
then
it
had
to
be
done
only
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
must
be
lovely
,
''
said
Mrs.
Vincy
,
when
Lydgate
mentioned
his
*NL*
purchase
with
some
descriptive
touches
.
``
Just
what
Rosy
ought
to
have
.
*NL*
I
trust
in
heaven
it
wo
n't
be
broken
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
must
hire
servants
who
will
not
break
things
,
''
said
Lydgate
.
*NL*
-LRB-
Certainly
,
this
was
reasoning
with
an
imperfect
vision
of
sequences
.
*NL*
But
at
that
period
there
was
no
sort
of
reasoning
which
was
not
more
or
*NL*
less
sanctioned
by
men
of
science
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
Of
course
it
was
unnecessary
to
defer
the
mention
of
anything
to
mamma
,
*NL*
who
did
not
readily
take
views
that
were
not
cheerful
,
and
being
a
*NL*
happy
wife
herself
,
had
hardly
any
feeling
but
pride
in
her
daughter
's
*NL*
marriage
.
But
Rosamond
had
good
reasons
for
suggesting
to
Lydgate
that
*NL*
papa
should
be
appealed
to
in
writing
.
She
prepared
for
the
arrival
of
*NL*
the
letter
by
walking
with
her
papa
to
the
warehouse
the
next
morning
,
*NL*
and
telling
him
on
the
way
that
Mr.
Lydgate
wished
to
be
married
soon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nonsense
,
my
dear
!
''
said
Mr.
Vincy
.
``
What
has
he
got
to
marry
on
?
*NL*
You
'd
much
better
give
up
the
engagement

I
've
told
you
so
pretty
*NL*
plainly
before
this
.
What
have
you
had
such
an
education
for
,
if
you
*NL*
are
to
go
and
marry
a
poor
man
?
It
's
a
cruel
thing
for
a
father
to
*NL*
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Lydgate
is
not
poor

He
bought
Mr.
Peacock

say
,
is
worth
eight
or
nine
hundred
a-year

*NL*
*NL*
``
Stuff

On

*NL*
``
A

We

*NL*
``

he
has
such
very
high

to
rise
in
one
way
or
another
.
He
is
engaged
*NL*
in
making
scientific
discoveries
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Vincy
was
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
give
up
my
only
prospect
of

Mr.
Lydgate
is
a

gentleman

I
could
never
love
any
one
who
was
not
a
perfect
gentleman
.
*NL*
You
would
not
like
me
to
go
into
a
consumption
,
as
Arabella
Hawley
did
.
*NL*
And
you
know
that
I
never
change
my
mind

''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
papa
was
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Promise
me
,
papa
,
that
you
will
consent
to
what
we
wish

We
shall
*NL*
never
give
each
other
up
;
and
you
know
that
you
have
always
objected
to
*NL*
long
courtships
and
late
marriages
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
little
more
urgency
of
this
kind
,
till
Mr.
Vincy
said
,
*NL*
``
Well
,
well
,
child
,
he
must
write
to
me
first
before
I
can
answer
*NL*
him
,
''
--
and
Rosamond
was
certain
that
she
had
gained
her
point
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Vincy
's
answer
consisted
chiefly
in
a
demand
that
Lydgate
should
*NL*
insure
his
life
--
a
demand
immediately
conceded
.
This
was
a
*NL*
delightfully
reassuring
idea
supposing
that
Lydgate
died
,
but
in
the
*NL*
mean
time
not
a
self-supporting
idea
.
However
,
it
seemed
to
make
*NL*
everything
comfortable
about
Rosamond
's
marriage
;
and
the
necessary
*NL*
purchases
went
on
with
much
spirit
.
Not
without
prudential
*NL*
considerations
,
however
.
A
bride
-LRB-
who
is
going
to
visit
at
a
*NL*
baronet
's
-RRB-
must
have
a
few
first-rate
pocket-handkerchiefs
;
but
beyond
*NL*
the
absolutely
necessary
half-dozen
,
Rosamond
contented
herself
without
*NL*
the
very
highest
style
of
embroidery
and
Valenciennes
.
Lydgate
also
,
*NL*
finding
that
his
sum
of
eight
hundred
pounds
had
been
considerably
*NL*
reduced
since
he
had
come
to
Middlemarch
,
restrained
his
inclination
*NL*
for
some
plate
of
an
old
pattern
which
was
shown
to
him
when
he
went
*NL*
into
Kibble
's
establishment
at
Brassing
to
buy
forks
and
spoons
.
He
*NL*
was
too
proud
to
act
as
if
he
presupposed
that
Mr.
Vincy
would
advance
*NL*
money
to
provide
furniture
;
and
though
,
since
it
would
not
be
*NL*
necessary
to
pay
for
everything
at
once
,
some
bills
would
be
left
*NL*
standing
over
,
he
did
not
waste
time
in
conjecturing
how
much
his
*NL*
father-in-law
would
give
in
the
form
of
dowry
,
to
make
payment
easy
.
*NL*
He
was
not
going
to
do
anything
extravagant
,
but
the
requisite
things
*NL*
must
be
bought
,
and
it
would
be
bad
economy
to
buy
them
of
a
poor
*NL*
quality
.
All
these
matters
were
by
the
bye
.
Lydgate
foresaw
that
*NL*
science
and
his
profession
were
the
objects
he
should
alone
pursue
*NL*
enthusiastically
;
but
he
could
not
imagine
himself
pursuing
them
in
*NL*
such
a
home
as
Wrench
had
--
the
doors
all
open
,
the
oil-cloth
worn
,
the
*NL*
children
in
soiled
pinafores
,
and
lunch
lingering
in
the
form
of
bones
,
*NL*
black-handled
knives
,
and
willow-pattern
.
But
Wrench
had
a
wretched
*NL*
lymphatic
wife
who
made
a
mummy
of
herself
indoors
in
a
large
shawl
;
*NL*
and
he
must
have
altogether
begun
with
an
ill-chosen
domestic
apparatus
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rosamond
,
however
,
was
on
her
side
much
occupied
with
conjectures
,
*NL*
though
her
quick
imitative
perception
warned
her
against
betraying
them
*NL*
too
crudely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
like
so
much
to
know
your
family
,
''
she
said
one
day
,
when
the
*NL*
wedding
journey
was
being
discussed
.
``
We
might
perhaps
take
a
*NL*
direction
that
would
allow
us
to
see
them
as
we
returned
.
Which
of
*NL*
your
uncles
do
you
like
best
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
--
my
uncle
Godwin
,
I
think
.
He
is
a
good-natured
old
fellow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
were
constantly
at
his
house
at
Quallingham
,
when
you
were
a
boy
,
*NL*
were
you
not
?
I
should
so
like
to
see
the
old
spot
and
everything
you
*NL*
were
used
to
.
Does
he
know
you
are
going
to
be
married
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Lydgate
,
carelessly
,
turning
in
his
chair
and
rubbing
his
*NL*
hair
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
send
him
word
of
it
,
you
naughty
undutiful
nephew
.
He
will
perhaps
*NL*
ask
you
to
take
me
to
Quallingham
;
and
then
you
could
show
me
about
the
*NL*
grounds
,
and
I
could
imagine
you
there
when
you
were
a
boy
.
Remember
,
*NL*
you
see
me
in
my
home
,
just
as
it
has
been
since
I
was
a
child
.
It
is
*NL*
not
fair
that
I
should
be
so
ignorant
of
yours
.
But
perhaps
you
would
*NL*
be
a
little
ashamed
of
me
.
I
forgot
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lydgate
smiled
at
her
tenderly
,
and
really
accepted
the
suggestion
that
*NL*
the
proud
pleasure
of
showing
so
charming
a
bride
was
worth
some
*NL*
trouble
.
And
now
he
came
to
think
of
it
,
he
would
like
to
see
the
old
*NL*
spots
with
Rosamond
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
write
to
him
,
then
.
But
my
cousins
are
bores
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
seemed
magnificent
to
Rosamond
to
be
able
to
speak
so
slightingly
of
*NL*
a
baronet
's
family
,
and
she
felt
much
contentment
in
the
prospect
of
*NL*
being
able
to
estimate
them
contemptuously
on
her
own
account
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
mamma
was
near
spoiling
all
,
a
day
or
two
later
,
by
saying
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
your
uncle
Sir
Godwin
will
not
look
down
on
Rosy
,
Mr.
Lydgate
.
*NL*
I
should
think
he
would
do
something
handsome
.
A
thousand
or
two
can
*NL*
be
nothing
to
a
baronet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mamma
!
''
said
Rosamond
,
blushing
deeply
;
and
Lydgate
pitied
her
so
much
*NL*
that
he
remained
silent
and
went
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
to
*NL*
examine
a
print
curiously
,
as
if
he
had
been
absent-minded
.
Mamma
had
a
*NL*
little
filial
lecture
afterwards
,
and
was
docile
as
usual
.
But
*NL*
Rosamond
reflected
that
if
any
of
those
high-bred
cousins
who
were
*NL*
bores
,
should
be
induced
to
visit
Middlemarch
,
they
would
see
many
*NL*
things
in
her
own
family
which
might
shock
them
.
Hence
it
seemed
*NL*
desirable
that
Lydgate
should
by-and-by
get
some
first-rate
position
*NL*
elsewhere
than
in
Middlemarch
;
and
this
could
hardly
be
difficult
in
*NL*
the
case
of
a
man
who
had
a
titled
uncle
and
could
make
discoveries
.
*NL*
Lydgate
,
you
perceive
,
had
talked
fervidly
to
Rosamond
of
his
hopes
as
*NL*
to
the
highest
uses
of
his
life
,
and
had
found
it
delightful
to
be
*NL*
listened
to
by
a
creature
who
would
bring
him
the
sweet
furtherance
of
*NL*
satisfying
affection
--
beauty
--
repose
--
such
help
as
our
thoughts
get
*NL*
from
the
summer
sky
and
the
flower-fringed
meadows
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lydgate
relied
much
on
the
psychological
difference
between
what
for
*NL*
the
sake
of
variety
I
will
call
goose
and
gander
:
especially
on
the
*NL*
innate
submissiveness
of
the
goose
as
beautifully
corresponding
to
the
*NL*
strength
of
the
gander
.

*NL*
The
doubt
hinted
by
Mr.
Vincy
whether
it
were
only
the
general
election
*NL*
or
the
end
of
the
world
that
was
coming
on
,
now
that
George
the
Fourth
*NL*
was
dead
,
Parliament
dissolved
,
Wellington
and
Peel
generally
*NL*
depreciated
and
the
new
King
apologetic
,
was
a
feeble
type
of
the
*NL*
uncertainties
in
provincial
opinion
at
that
time
.
With
the
glow-worm
*NL*
lights
of
country
places
,
how
could
men
see
which
were
their
own
*NL*
thoughts
in
the
confusion
of
a
Tory
Ministry
passing
Liberal
measures
,
*NL*
of
Tory
nobles
and
electors
being
anxious
to
return
Liberals
rather
*NL*
than
friends
of
the
recreant
Ministers
,
and
of
outcries
for
remedies
*NL*
which
seemed
to
have
a
mysteriously
remote
bearing
on
private
interest
,
*NL*
and
were
made
suspicious
by
the
advocacy
of
disagreeable
neighbors
?
*NL*
Buyers
of
the
Middlemarch
newspapers
found
themselves
in
an
anomalous
*NL*
position
:
during
the
agitation
on
the
Catholic
Question
many
had
given
*NL*
up
the
``
Pioneer
''
--
which
had
a
motto
from
Charles
James
Fox
and
was
in
*NL*
the
van
of
progress
--
because
it
had
taken
Peel
's
side
about
the
*NL*
Papists
,
and
had
thus
blotted
its
Liberalism
with
a
toleration
of
*NL*
Jesuitry
and
Baal
;
but
they
were
ill-satisfied
with
the
``
Trumpet
,
''
*NL*
which
--
since
its
blasts
against
Rome
,
and
in
the
general
flaccidity
of
*NL*
the
public
mind
-LRB-
nobody
knowing
who
would
support
whom
-RRB-
--
had
become
*NL*
feeble
in
its
blowing
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
time
,
according
to
a
noticeable
article
in
the
``
Pioneer
,
''
when
*NL*
the
crying
needs
of
the
country
might
well
counteract
a
reluctance
to
*NL*
public
action
on
the
part
of
men
whose
minds
had
from
long
experience
*NL*
acquired
breadth
as
well
as
concentration
,
decision
of
judgment
as
well
*NL*
as
tolerance
,
dispassionateness
as
well
as
energy
--
in
fact
,
all
those
*NL*
qualities
which
in
the
melancholy
experience
of
mankind
have
been
the
*NL*
least
disposed
to
share
lodgings
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Hackbutt
,
whose
fluent
speech
was
at
that
time
floating
more
widely
*NL*
than
usual
,
and
leaving
much
uncertainty
as
to
its
ultimate
channel
,
*NL*
was
heard
to
say
in
Mr.
Hawley
's
office
that
the
article
in
question
*NL*
``
emanated
''
from
Brooke
of
Tipton
,
and
that
Brooke
had
secretly
bought
*NL*
the
``

some
months
ago

*NL*
*NL*
``
That

said
Mr.

business
has
an
old
county
man
to
come
currying

with

low
set
of

dark-blue
freemen

As
to
his
paper

I
only
hope

It
would
be
worth

*NL*

go

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Hawley
's
disgust
at
the
notion
of
the
``
Pioneer
''
being
edited
by
an
*NL*
emissary
,
and
of
Brooke
becoming
actively
political
--
as
if
a
tortoise
*NL*
of
desultory
pursuits
should
protrude
its
small
head
ambitiously
and
*NL*
become
rampant
--
was
hardly
equal
to
the
annoyance
felt
by
some
members
*NL*
of
Mr.
Brooke
's
own
family
.
The
result
had
oozed
forth
gradually
,
like
*NL*
the
discovery
that
your
neighbor
has
set
up
an
unpleasant
kind
of
*NL*
manufacture
which
will
be
permanently
under
your
nostrils
without
legal
*NL*
remedy
.
The
``
Pioneer
''
had
been
secretly
bought
even
before
Will
*NL*
Ladislaw
's
arrival
,
the
expected
opportunity
having
offered
itself
in
*NL*
the
readiness
of
the
proprietor
to
part
with
a
valuable
property
which
*NL*
did
not
pay
;
and
in
the
interval
since
Mr.
Brooke
had
written
his
*NL*
invitation
,
those
germinal
ideas
of
making
his
mind
tell
upon
the
world
*NL*
at
large
which
had
been
present
in
him
from
his
younger
years
,
but
had
*NL*
hitherto
lain
in
some
obstruction
,
had
been
sprouting
under
cover
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
development
was
much
furthered
by
a
delight
in
his
guest
which
*NL*
proved
greater
even
than
he
had
anticipated
.
For
it
seemed
that
Will
*NL*
was
not
only
at
home
in
all
those
artistic
and
literary
subjects
which
*NL*
Mr.
Brooke
had
gone
into
at
one
time
,
but
that
he
was
strikingly
ready
*NL*
at
seizing
the
points
of
the
political
situation
,
and
dealing
with
them
*NL*
in
that
large
spirit
which
,
aided
by
adequate
memory
,
lends
itself
to
*NL*
quotation
and
general
effectiveness
of
treatment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
seems
to
me
a
kind
of
Shelley
,
you
know
,
''
Mr.
Brooke
took
an
*NL*
opportunity
of
saying
,
for
the
gratification
of
Mr.
Casaubon
.
``
I
do
n't
*NL*
mean
as
to
anything
objectionable
--
laxities
or
atheism
,
or
anything
of
*NL*
that
kind
,
you
know
--
Ladislaw
's
sentiments
in
every
way
I
am
sure
are
*NL*
good
--
indeed
,
we
were
talking
a
great
deal
together
last
night
.
But
he
*NL*
has
the
same
sort
of
enthusiasm
for
liberty
,
freedom
,
emancipation
--
a
*NL*
fine
thing
under
guidance
--
under
guidance
,
you
know
.
I
think
I
shall
*NL*
be
able
to
put
him
on
the
right
tack
;
and
I
am
the
more
pleased
because
*NL*
he
is
a
relation
of
yours
,
Casaubon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
If
the
right
tack
implied
anything
more
precise
than
the
rest
of
Mr.
*NL*
Brooke
's
speech
,
Mr.
Casaubon
silently
hoped
that
it
referred
to
some
*NL*
occupation
at
a
great
distance
from
Lowick
.
He
had
disliked
Will
while
*NL*
he
helped
him
,
but
he
had
begun
to
dislike
him
still
more
now
that
Will
*NL*
had
declined
his
help
.
That
is
the
way
with
us
when
we
have
any
uneasy
*NL*
jealousy
in
our
disposition
:
if
our
talents
are
chiefly
of
the
*NL*
burrowing
kind
,
our
honey-sipping
cousin
-LRB-
whom
we
have
grave
reasons
*NL*
for
objecting
to
-RRB-
is
likely
to
have
a
secret
contempt
for
us
,
and
any
*NL*
one
who
admires
him
passes
an
oblique
criticism
on
ourselves
.
Having
*NL*
the
scruples
of
rectitude
in
our
souls
,
we
are
above
the
meanness
of
*NL*
injuring
him
--
rather
we
meet
all
his
claims
on
us
by
active
benefits
;
*NL*
and
the
drawing
of
cheques
for
him
,
being
a
superiority
which
he
must
*NL*
recognize
,
gives
our
bitterness
a
milder
infusion
.
Now
Mr.
Casaubon
*NL*
had
been
deprived
of
that
superiority
-LRB-
as
anything
more
than
a
*NL*
remembrance
-RRB-
in
a
sudden
,
capricious
manner
.
His
antipathy
to
Will
did
*NL*
not
spring
from
the
common
jealousy
of
a
winter-worn
husband
:
it
was
*NL*
something
deeper
,
bred
by
his
lifelong
claims
and
discontents
;
but
*NL*
Dorothea
,
now
that
she
was
present
--
Dorothea
,
as
a
young
wife
who
*NL*
herself
had
shown
an
offensive
capability
of
criticism
,
necessarily
*NL*
gave
concentration
to
the
uneasiness
which
had
before
been
vague
.
*NL*
*NL*
Will
Ladislaw
on
his
side
felt
that
his
dislike
was
flourishing
at
the
*NL*
expense
of
his
gratitude
,
and
spent
much
inward
discourse
in
justifying
*NL*
the
dislike
.
Casaubon
hated
him
--
he
knew
that
very
well
;
on
his
first
*NL*
entrance
he
could
discern
a
bitterness
in
the
mouth
and
a
venom
in
the
*NL*
glance
which
would
almost
justify
declaring
war
in
spite
of
past
*NL*
benefits
.
He
was
much
obliged
to
Casaubon
in
the
past
,
but
really
the
*NL*
act
of
marrying
this
wife
was
a
set-off
against
the
obligation
.
It
was
*NL*
a
question
whether
gratitude
which
refers
to
what
is
done
for
one
's
*NL*
self
ought
not
to
give
way
to
indignation
at
what
is
done
against
*NL*
another
.
And
Casaubon
had
done
a
wrong
to
Dorothea
in
marrying
her
.
A
*NL*
man
was
bound
to
know
himself
better
than
that
,
and
if
he
chose
to
grow
*NL*
gray
crunching
bones
in
a
cavern
,
he
had
no
business
to
be
luring
a
*NL*
girl
into
his
companionship
.
``
It
is
the
most
horrible
of
*NL*
virgin-sacrifices
,
''
said
Will
;
and
he
painted
to
himself
what
were
*NL*
Dorothea
's
inward
sorrows
as
if
he
had
been
writing
a
choric
wail
.
But
*NL*
he
would
never
lose
sight
of
her
:
he
would
watch
over
her
--
if
he
gave
*NL*
up
everything
else
in
life
he
would
watch
over
her
,
and
she
should
know
*NL*
that
she
had
one
slave
in
the
world
,
Will
had
--
to
use
Sir
Thomas
*NL*
Browne
's
phrase
--
a
``
passionate
prodigality
''
of
statement
both
to
*NL*
himself
and
others
.
The
simple
truth
was
that
nothing
then
invited
him
*NL*
so
strongly
as
the
presence
of
Dorothea
.
*NL*
*NL*
Invitations
of
the
formal
kind
had
been
wanting
,
however
,
for
Will
had
*NL*
never
been
asked
to
go
to
Lowick
.
Mr.
Brooke
,
indeed
,
confident
of
*NL*
doing
everything
agreeable
which
Casaubon
,
poor
fellow
,
was
too
much
*NL*
absorbed
to
think
of
,
had
arranged
to
bring
Ladislaw
to
Lowick
several
*NL*
times
-LRB-
not
neglecting
meanwhile
to
introduce
him
elsewhere
on
every
*NL*
opportunity
as
``
a
young
relative
of
Casaubon
's
''
-RRB-
.
And
though
Will
had
*NL*
not
seen
Dorothea
alone
,
their
interviews
had
been
enough
to
restore
*NL*
her
former
sense
of
young
companionship
with
one
who
was
cleverer
than
*NL*
herself
,
yet
seemed
ready
to
be
swayed
by
her
.
Poor
Dorothea
before
*NL*
her
marriage
had
never
found
much
room
in
other
minds
for
what
she
*NL*
cared
most
to
say
;
and
she
had
not
,
as
we
know
,
enjoyed
her
husband
's
*NL*
superior
instruction
so
much
as
she
had
expected
.
If
she
spoke
with
*NL*
any
keenness
of
interest
to
Mr.
Casaubon
,
he
heard
her
with
an
air
of
*NL*
patience
as
if
she
had
given
a
quotation
from
the
Delectus
familiar
to
*NL*
him
from
his
tender
years
,
and
sometimes
mentioned
curtly
what
ancient
*NL*
sects
or
personages
had
held
similar
ideas
,
as
if
there
were
too
much
*NL*
of
that
sort
in
stock
already
;
at
other
times
he
would
inform
her
that
*NL*
she
was
mistaken
,
and
reassert
what
her
remark
had
questioned
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Will
Ladislaw
always
seemed
to
see
more
in
what
she
said
than
she
*NL*
herself
saw
.
Dorothea
had
little
vanity
,
but
she
had
the
ardent
*NL*
woman
's
need
to
rule
beneficently
by
making
the
joy
of
another
soul
.
*NL*
Hence
the
mere
chance
of
seeing
Will
occasionally
was
like
a
lunette
*NL*
opened
in
the
wall
of
her
prison
,
giving
her
a
glimpse
of
the
sunny
*NL*
air
;
and
this
pleasure
began
to
nullify
her
original
alarm
at
what
her
*NL*
husband
might
think
about
the
introduction
of
Will
as
her
uncle
's
*NL*
guest
.
On
this
subject
Mr.
Casaubon
had
remained
dumb
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Will
wanted
to
talk
with
Dorothea
alone
,
and
was
impatient
of
slow
*NL*
circumstance
.
However
slight
the
terrestrial
intercourse
between
Dante
*NL*
and
Beatrice
or
Petrarch
and
Laura
,
time
changes
the
proportion
of
*NL*
things
,
and
in
later
days
it
is
preferable
to
have
fewer
sonnets
and
*NL*
more
conversation
.
Necessity
excused
stratagem
,
but
stratagem
was
*NL*
limited
by
the
dread
of
offending
Dorothea
.
He
found
out
at
last
that
*NL*
he
wanted
to
take
a
particular
sketch
at
Lowick
;
and
one
morning
when
*NL*
Mr.
Brooke
had
to
drive
along
the
Lowick
road
on
his
way
to
the
county
*NL*
town
,
Will
asked
to
be
set
down
with
his
sketch-book
and
camp-stool
at
*NL*
Lowick
,
and
without
announcing
himself
at
the
Manor
settled
himself
to
*NL*
sketch
in
a
position
where
he
must
see
Dorothea
if
she
came
out
to
*NL*
walk
--
and
he
knew
that
she
usually
walked
an
hour
in
the
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
stratagem
was
defeated
by
the
weather
.
Clouds
gathered
with
*NL*
treacherous
quickness
,
the
rain
came
down
,
and
Will
was
obliged
to
take
*NL*
shelter
in
the
house
.
He
intended
,
on
the
strength
of
relationship
,
to
*NL*
go
into
the
drawing-room
and
wait
there
without
being
announced
;
and
*NL*
seeing
his
old
acquaintance
the
butler
in
the
hall
,
he
said
,
``
Do
n't
*NL*
mention
that
I
am
here
,
Pratt
;
I
will
wait
till
luncheon
;
I
know
Mr.
*NL*
Casaubon
does
not
like
to
be
disturbed
when
he
is
in
the
library
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Master
is
out
,
sir
;
there
's
only
Mrs.
Casaubon
in
the
library
.
I
'd
*NL*
better
tell
her
you
're
here
,
sir
,
''
said
Pratt
,
a
red-cheeked
man
given
*NL*
to
lively
converse
with
Tantripp
,
and
often
agreeing
with
her
that
it
*NL*
must
be
dull
for
Madam
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
very
well
;
this
confounded
rain
has
hindered
me
from
sketching
,
''
*NL*
said
Will
,
feeling
so
happy
that
he
affected
indifference
with
*NL*
delightful
ease
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
another
minute
he
was
in
the
library
,
and
Dorothea
was
meeting
him
*NL*
with
her
sweet
unconstrained
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Casaubon
has
gone
to
the
Archdeacon
's
,
''
she
said
,
at
once
.
``
I
*NL*
do
n't
know
whether
he
will
be
at
home
again
long
before
dinner
.
He
was
*NL*
uncertain
how
long
he
should
be
.
Did
you
want
to
say
anything
*NL*
particular
to
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
I
came
to
sketch
,
but
the
rain
drove
me
in
.
Else
I
would
not
have
*NL*
disturbed
you
yet
.
I
supposed
that
Mr.
Casaubon
was
here
,
and
I
know
*NL*
he
dislikes
interruption
at
this
hour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
indebted
to
the
rain
,
then
.
I
am
so
glad
to
see
you
.
''
Dorothea
*NL*
uttered
these
common
words
with
the
simple
sincerity
of
an
unhappy
*NL*
child
,
visited
at
school
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
really
came
for
the
chance
of
seeing
you
alone
,
''
said
Will
,
*NL*
mysteriously
forced
to
be
just
as
simple
as
she
was
.
He
could
not
stay
*NL*
to
ask
himself
,
why
not
?
``
I
wanted
to
talk
about
things
,
as
we
did
in
*NL*
Rome
.
It
always
makes
a
difference
when
other
people
are
present
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
in
her
clear
full
tone
of
assent
.
``
Sit
down
.
''
*NL*
She
seated
herself
on
a
dark
ottoman
with
the
brown
books
behind
her
,
*NL*
looking
in
her
plain
dress
of
some
thin
woollen-white
material
,
without
*NL*
a
single
ornament
on
her
besides
her
wedding-ring
,
as
if
she
were
under
*NL*
a
vow
to
be
different
from
all
other
women
;
and
Will
sat
down
opposite
*NL*
her
at
two
yards
'
distance
,
the
light
falling
on
his
bright
curls
and
*NL*
delicate
but
rather
petulant
profile
,
with
its
defiant
curves
of
lip
*NL*
and
chin
.
Each
looked
at
the
other
as
if
they
had
been
two
flowers
*NL*
which
had
opened
then
and
there
.
Dorothea
for
the
moment
forgot
her
*NL*
husband
's
mysterious
irritation
against
Will
:
it
seemed
fresh
water
at
*NL*
her
thirsty
lips
to
speak
without
fear
to
the
one
person
whom
she
had
*NL*
found
receptive
;
for
in
looking
backward
through
sadness
she
*NL*
exaggerated
a
past
solace
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
often
thought
that
I
should
like
to
talk
to
you
again
,
''
she
*NL*
said
,
immediately
.
``
It
seems
strange
to
me
how
many
things
I
said
to
*NL*
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
remember
them
all
,
''
said
Will
,
with
the
unspeakable
content
in
his
*NL*
soul
of
feeling
that
he
was
in
the
presence
of
a
creature
worthy
to
be
*NL*
perfectly
loved
.
I
think
his
own
feelings
at
that
moment
were
perfect
,
*NL*
for
we
mortals
have
our
divine
moments
,
when
love
is
satisfied
in
the
*NL*
completeness
of
the
beloved
object
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
tried
to
learn
a
great
deal
since
we
were
in
Rome
,
''
said
*NL*
Dorothea
.
``
I
can
read
Latin
a
little
,
and
I
am
beginning
to
understand
*NL*
just
a
little
Greek
.
I
can
help
Mr.
Casaubon
better
now
.
I
can
find
*NL*
out
references
for
him
and
save
his
eyes
in
many
ways
.
But
it
is
very
*NL*
difficult
to
be
learned
;
it
seems
as
if
people
were
worn
out
on
the
way
*NL*
to
great
thoughts
,
and
can
never
enjoy
them
because
they
are
too
tired
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
a
man
has
a
capacity
for
great
thoughts
,
he
is
likely
to
overtake
*NL*
them
before
he
is
decrepit
,
''
said
Will
,
with
irrepressible
quickness
.
*NL*
But
through
certain
sensibilities
Dorothea
was
as
quick
as
he
,
and
*NL*
seeing
her
face
change
,
he
added
,
immediately
,
``
But
it
is
quite
true
*NL*
that
the
best
minds
have
been
sometimes
overstrained
in
working
out
*NL*
their
ideas
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
correct
me
,
''
said
Dorothea
.
``
I
expressed
myself
ill
.
I
should
*NL*
have
said
that
those
who
have
great
thoughts
get
too
much
worn
in
*NL*
working
them
out
.
I
used
to
feel
about
that
,
even
when
I
was
a
little
*NL*
girl
;
and
it
always
seemed
to
me
that
the
use
I
should
like
to
make
of
*NL*
my
life
would
be
to
help
some
one
who
did
great
works
,
so
that
his
*NL*
burthen
might
be
lighter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
was
led
on
to
this
bit
of
autobiography
without
any
sense
of
*NL*
making
a
revelation
.
But
she
had
never
before
said
anything
to
Will
*NL*
which
threw
so
strong
a
light
on
her
marriage
.
He
did
not
shrug
his
*NL*
shoulders
;
and
for
want
of
that
muscular
outlet
he
thought
the
more
*NL*
irritably
of
beautiful
lips
kissing
holy
skulls
and
other
emptinesses
*NL*
ecclesiastically
enshrined
.
Also
he
had
to
take
care
that
his
speech
*NL*
should
not
betray
that
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
may
easily
carry
the
help
too
far
,
''
he
said
,
``
and
get
*NL*
over-wrought
yourself
.
Are
you
not
too
much
shut
up
?
You
already
look
*NL*
paler
.
It
would
be
better
for
Mr.
Casaubon
to
have
a
secretary
;
he
*NL*
could
easily
get
a
man
who
would
do
half
his
work
for
him
.
It
would
*NL*
save
him
more
effectually
,
and
you
need
only
help
him
in
lighter
ways
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
you
think
of
that
?
''
said
Dorothea
,
in
a
tone
of
earnest
*NL*
remonstrance
.
``
I
should
have
no
happiness
if
I
did
not
help
him
in
his
*NL*
work
.
What
could
I
do
?
There
is
no
good
to
be
done
in
Lowick
.
The
*NL*
only
thing
I
desire
is
to
help
him
more
.
And
he
objects
to
a
*NL*
secretary
:
please
not
to
mention
that
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
not
,
now
I
know
your
feeling
.
But
I
have
heard
both
Mr.
*NL*
Brooke
and
Sir
James
Chettam
express
the
same
wish
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
?
''
said
Dorothea
,
``
but
they
do
n't
understand
--
they
want
me
to
be
a
*NL*
great
deal
on
horseback
,
and
have
the
garden
altered
and
new
*NL*
conservatories
,
to
fill
up
my
days
.
I
thought
you
could
understand
*NL*
that
one
's
mind
has
other
wants
,
''
she
added
,
rather
*NL*
impatiently
--
``
besides
,
Mr.
Casaubon
can
not
bear
to
hear
of
a
secretary
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
mistake
is
excusable
,
''
said
Will
.
``
In
old
days
I
used
to
hear
Mr.
*NL*
Casaubon
speak
as
if
he
looked
forward
to
having
a
secretary
.
Indeed
*NL*
he
held
out
the
prospect
of
that
office
to
me
.
But
I
turned
out
to
*NL*
be
--
not
good
enough
for
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
was
trying
to
extract
out
of
this
an
excuse
for
her
husband
's
*NL*
evident
repulsion
,
as
she
said
,
with
a
playful
smile
,
``
You
were
not
a
*NL*
steady
worker
enough
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Will
,
shaking
his
head
backward
somewhat
after
the
manner
of
*NL*
a
spirited
horse
.
And
then
,
the
old
irritable
demon
prompting
him
to
*NL*
give
another
good
pinch
at
the
moth-wings
of
poor
Mr.
Casaubon
's
glory
,
*NL*
he
went
on
,
``
And
I
have
seen
since
that
Mr.
Casaubon
does
not
like
any
*NL*
one
to
overlook
his
work
and
know
thoroughly
what
he
is
doing
.
He
is
*NL*
too
doubtful
--
too
uncertain
of
himself
.
I
may
not
be
good
for
much
,
*NL*
but
he
dislikes
me
because
I
disagree
with
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Will
was
not
without
his
intentions
to
be
always
generous
,
but
our
*NL*
tongues
are
little
triggers
which
have
usually
been
pulled
before
*NL*
general
intentions
can
be
brought
to
bear
.
And
it
was
too
intolerable
*NL*
that
Casaubon
's
dislike
of
him
should
not
be
fairly
accounted
for
to
*NL*
Dorothea
.
Yet
when
he
had
spoken
he
was
rather
uneasy
as
to
the
effect
*NL*
on
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Dorothea
was
strangely
quiet
--
not
immediately
indignant
,
as
she
had
*NL*
been
on
a
like
occasion
in
Rome
.
And
the
cause
lay
deep
.
She
was
no
*NL*
longer
struggling
against
the
perception
of
facts
,
but
adjusting
*NL*
herself
to
their
clearest
perception
;
and
now
when
she
looked
steadily
*NL*
at
her
husband
's
failure
,
still
more
at
his
possible
consciousness
of
*NL*
failure
,
she
seemed
to
be
looking
along
the
one
track
where
duty
became
*NL*
tenderness
.
Will
's
want
of
reticence
might
have
been
met
with
more
*NL*
severity
,
if
he
had
not
already
been
recommended
to
her
mercy
by
her
*NL*
husband
's
dislike
,
which
must
seem
hard
to
her
till
she
saw
better
*NL*
reason
for
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
answer
at
once
,
but
after
looking
down
ruminatingly
she
*NL*
said
,
with
some
earnestness
,
``
Mr.
Casaubon
must
have
overcome
his
*NL*
dislike
of
you
so
far
as
his
actions
were
concerned
:
and
that
is
*NL*
admirable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
he
has
shown
a
sense
of
justice
in
family
matters
.
It
was
an
*NL*
abominable
thing
that
my
grandmother
should
have
been
disinherited
*NL*
because
she
made
what
they
called
a
mesalliance
,
though
there
was
*NL*
nothing
to
be
said
against
her
husband
except
that
he
was
a
Polish
*NL*
refugee
who
gave
lessons
for
his
bread
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
I
knew
all
about
her
!
''
said
Dorothea
.
``
I
wonder
how
she
bore
*NL*
the
change
from
wealth
to
poverty
:
I
wonder
whether
she
was
happy
with
*NL*
her
husband
!
Do
you
know
much
about
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
only
that
my
grandfather
was
a
patriot
--
a
bright
fellow
--
could
*NL*
speak
many
languages
--
musical
--
got
his
bread
by
teaching
all
sorts
of
*NL*
things
.
They
both
died
rather
early
.
And
I
never
knew
much
of
my
*NL*
father
,
beyond
what
my
mother
told
me
;
but
he
inherited
the
musical
*NL*
talents
.
I
remember
his
slow
walk
and
his
long
thin
hands
;
and
one
day
*NL*
remains
with
me
when
he
was
lying
ill
,
and
I
was
very
hungry
,
and
had
*NL*
only
a
little
bit
of
bread
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
what
a
different
life
from
mine
!
''
said
Dorothea
,
with
keen
*NL*
interest
,
clasping
her
hands
on
her
lap
.
``
I
have
always
had
too
much
*NL*
of
everything
.
But
tell
me
how
it
was
--
Mr.
Casaubon
could
not
have
*NL*
known
about
you
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
but
my
father
had
made
himself
known
to
Mr.
Casaubon
,
and
that
was
*NL*
my
last
hungry
day
.
My
father
died
soon
after
,
and
my
mother
and
I
*NL*
were
well
taken
care
of
.
Mr.
Casaubon
always
expressly
recognized
it
*NL*
as
his
duty
to
take
care
of
us
because
of
the
harsh
injustice
which
had
*NL*
been
shown
to
his
mother
's
sister
.
But
now
I
am
telling
you
what
is
*NL*
not
new
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
his
inmost
soul
Will
was
conscious
of
wishing
to
tell
Dorothea
what
*NL*
was
rather
new
even
in
his
own
construction
of
things
--
namely
,
that
*NL*
Mr.
Casaubon
had
never
done
more
than
pay
a
debt
towards
him
.
Will
was
*NL*
much
too
good
a
fellow
to
be
easy
under
the
sense
of
being
ungrateful
.
*NL*
And
when
gratitude
has
become
a
matter
of
reasoning
there
are
many
ways
*NL*
of
escaping
from
its
bonds
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
answered
Dorothea
;
``
Mr.
Casaubon
has
always
avoided
dwelling
on
*NL*
his
own
honorable
actions
.
''
She
did
not
feel
that
her
husband
's
*NL*
conduct
was
depreciated
;
but
this
notion
of
what
justice
had
required
*NL*
in
his
relations
with
Will
Ladislaw
took
strong
hold
on
her
mind
.
*NL*
After
a
moment
's
pause
,
she
added
,
``
He
had
never
told
me
that
he
*NL*
supported
your
mother
.
Is
she
still
living
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
she
died
by
an
accident
--
a
fall
--
four
years
ago
.
It
is
curious
*NL*
that
my
mother
,
too
,
ran
away
from
her
family
,
but
not
for
the
sake
of
*NL*
her
husband
.
She
never
would
tell
me
anything
about
her
family
,
except
*NL*
that
she
forsook
them
to
get
her
own
living
--
went
on
the
stage
,
in
*NL*
fact
.
She
was
a
dark-eyed
creature
,
with
crisp
ringlets
,
and
never
*NL*
seemed
to
be
getting
old
.
You
see
I
come
of
rebellious
blood
on
both
*NL*
sides
,
''
Will
ended
,
smiling
brightly
at
Dorothea
,
while
she
was
still
*NL*
looking
with
serious
intentness
before
her
,
like
a
child
seeing
a
drama
*NL*
for
the
first
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
her
face
,
too
,
broke
into
a
smile
as
she
said
,
``
That
is
your
*NL*
apology
,
I
suppose
,
for
having
yourself
been
rather
rebellious
;
I
mean
,
*NL*
to
Mr.
Casaubon
's
wishes
.
You
must
remember
that
you
have
not
done
*NL*
what
he
thought
best
for
you
.
And
if
he
dislikes
you
--
you
were
*NL*
speaking
of
dislike
a
little
while
ago
--
but
I
should
rather
say
,
if
he
*NL*
has
shown
any
painful
feelings
towards
you
,
you
must
consider
how
*NL*
sensitive
he
has
become
from
the
wearing
effect
of
study
.
Perhaps
,
''
*NL*
she
continued
,
getting
into
a
pleading
tone
,
``
my
uncle
has
not
told
you
*NL*
how
serious
Mr.
Casaubon
's
illness
was
.
It
would
be
very
petty
of
us
*NL*
who
are
well
and
can
bear
things
,
to
think
much
of
small
offences
from
*NL*
those
who
carry
a
weight
of
trial
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
teach
me
better
,
''
said
Will
.
``
I
will
never
grumble
on
that
*NL*
subject
again
.
''
There
was
a
gentleness
in
his
tone
which
came
from
the
*NL*
unutterable
contentment
of
perceiving
--
what
Dorothea
was
hardly
*NL*
conscious
of
--
that
she
was
travelling
into
the
remoteness
of
pure
pity
*NL*
and
loyalty
towards
her
husband
.
Will
was
ready
to
adore
her
pity
and
*NL*
loyalty
,
if
she
would
associate
himself
with
her
in
manifesting
them
.
*NL*
``
I
have
really
sometimes
been
a
perverse
fellow
,
''
he
went
on
,
``
but
I
*NL*
will
never
again
,
if
I
can
help
it
,
do
or
say
what
you
would
*NL*
disapprove
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
very
good
of
you
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
with
another
open
smile
.
``
I
*NL*
shall
have
a
little
kingdom
then
,
where
I
shall
give
laws
.
But
you
*NL*
will
soon
go
away
,
out
of
my
rule
,
I
imagine
.
You
will
soon
be
tired
*NL*
of
staying
at
the
Grange
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
a
point
I
wanted
to
mention
to
you
--
one
of
the
reasons
why
I
*NL*
wished
to
speak
to
you
alone
.
Mr.
Brooke
proposes
that
I
should
stay
*NL*
in
this
neighborhood
.
He
has
bought
one
of
the
Middlemarch
newspapers
,
*NL*
and
he
wishes
me
to
conduct
that
,
and
also
to
help
him
in
other
ways
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
not
that
be
a
sacrifice
of
higher
prospects
for
you
?
''
said
*NL*
Dorothea
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
;
but
I
have
always
been
blamed
for
thinking
of
prospects
,
and
*NL*
not
settling
to
anything

And
here
is
something
offered
to
me
.
If
you
*NL*
would
not
like
me
to
accept
it
,
I
will
give
it
up
.
Otherwise
I
would
*NL*
rather
stay
in
this
part
of
the
country
than
go
away

I
belong
to
*NL*
nobody
anywhere
else

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
like
you
to
stay
very
much
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
at
once
,
as
*NL*
simply
and
readily
as
she
had
spoken
at
Rome
.
There
was
not
the
shadow
*NL*
of
a
reason
in
her
mind
at
the
moment
why
she
should
not
say
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I

will
_
stay

said
Ladislaw
,
shaking
his
head
backward
,
rising
*NL*
and
going
towards
the
window
,
as
if
to
see
whether
the
rain
had
ceased
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
next
moment
,
Dorothea
,
according
to
a
habit
which
was
getting
*NL*
continually
stronger
,
began
to
reflect
that
her
husband
felt
*NL*
differently
from
herself
,
and
she
colored
deeply
under
the
double
*NL*
embarrassment
of
having
expressed
what
might
be
in
opposition
to
her
*NL*
husband
's
feeling
,
and
of
having
to
suggest
this
opposition
to
Will
.
*NL*
His
face
was
not
turned
towards
her
,
and
this
made
it
easier
to
say
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
my
opinion
is
of
little
consequence
on
such
a
subject
.
I
think
*NL*
you
should
be
guided
by
Mr.
Casaubon
.
I
spoke
without
thinking
of
*NL*
anything
else
than
my
own
feeling
,
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
*NL*
real
question
.
But
it
now
occurs
to
me
--
perhaps
Mr.
Casaubon
might
*NL*
see
that
the
proposal
was
not
wise
.
Can
you
not
wait
now
and
mention
*NL*
it
to
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
wait
to-day
,
''
said
Will
,
inwardly
seared
by
the
possibility
*NL*
that
Mr.
Casaubon
would
enter
.
``
The
rain
is
quite
over
now
.
I
told
*NL*
Mr.
Brooke
not
to
call
for
me
:
I
would
rather
walk
the
five
miles
.
I
*NL*
shall
strike
across
Halsell
Common
,
and
see
the
gleams
on
the
wet
*NL*
grass
.
I
like
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
approached
her
to
shake
hands
quite
hurriedly
,
longing
but
not
*NL*
daring
to
say
,
``
Do
n't
mention
the
subject
to
Mr.
Casaubon
.
''
No
,
he
*NL*
dared
not
,
could
not
say
it
.
To
ask
her
to
be
less
simple
and
direct
*NL*
would
be
like
breathing
on
the
crystal
that
you
want
to
see
the
light
*NL*
through
.
And
there
was
always
the
other
great
dread
--
of
himself
*NL*
becoming
dimmed
and
forever
ray-shorn
in
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
you
could
have
stayed
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
with
a
touch
of
*NL*
mournfulness
,
as
she
rose
and
put
out
her
hand
.
She
also
had
her
*NL*
thought
which
she
did
not
like
to
express
:
--
Will
certainly
ought
to
*NL*
lose
no
time
in
consulting
Mr.
Casaubon
's
wishes
,
but
for
her
to
urge
*NL*
this
might
seem
an
undue
dictation
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
they
only
said
``
Good-by
,
''
and
Will
quitted
the
house
,
striking
*NL*
across
the
fields
so
as
not
to
run
any
risk
of
encountering
Mr.
*NL*
Casaubon
's
carriage
,
which
,
however
,
did
not
appear
at
the
gate
until
*NL*
four
o'clock
.
That
was
an
unpropitious
hour
for
coming
home
:
it
was
too
*NL*
early
to
gain
the
moral
support
under
ennui
of
dressing
his
person
for
*NL*
dinner
,
and
too
late
to
undress
his
mind
of
the
day
's
frivolous
*NL*
ceremony
and
affairs
,
so
as
to
be
prepared
for
a
good
plunge
into
the
*NL*
serious
business
of
study
.
On
such
occasions
he
usually
threw
into
an
*NL*
easy-chair
in
the
library
,
and
allowed
Dorothea
to
read
the
London
*NL*
papers
to
him
,
closing
his
eyes
the
while
.
To-day
,
however
,
he
*NL*
declined
that
relief
,
observing
that
he
had
already
had
too
many
public
*NL*
details
urged
upon
him
;
but
he
spoke
more
cheerfully
than
usual
,
when
*NL*
Dorothea
asked
about
his
fatigue
,
and
added
with
that
air
of
formal
*NL*
effort
which
never
forsook
him
even
when
he
spoke
without
his
waistcoat
*NL*
and
cravat
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
had
the
gratification
of
meeting
my
former
acquaintance
,
Dr.
*NL*
Spanning
,
to-day
,
and
of
being
praised
by
one
who
is
himself
a
worthy
*NL*
recipient
of
praise
.
He
spoke
very
handsomely
of
my
late
tractate
on
*NL*
the
Egyptian
Mysteries
,
--
using
,
in
fact
,
terms
which
it
would
not
*NL*
become
me
to
repeat
.
''
In
uttering
the
last
clause
,
Mr.
Casaubon
leaned
*NL*
over
the
elbow
of
his
chair
,
and
swayed
his
head
up
and
down
,
*NL*
apparently
as
a
muscular
outlet
instead
of
that
recapitulation
which
*NL*
would
not
have
been
becoming
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
glad
you
have
had
that
pleasure
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
delighted
*NL*
to
see
her
husband
less
weary
than
usual
at
this
hour
.
``
Before
you
*NL*
came
I
had
been
regretting
that
you
happened
to
be
out
to-day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
so
,
my
dear
?
''
said
Mr.
Casaubon
,
throwing
himself
backward
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
Mr.
Ladislaw
has
been
here
;
and
he
has
mentioned
a
proposal
of
*NL*
my
uncle
's
which
I
should
like
to
know
your
opinion
of
.
''
Her
husband
*NL*
she
felt
was
really
concerned
in
this
question
.
Even
with
her
*NL*
ignorance
of
the
world
she
had
a
vague
impression
that
the
position
*NL*
offered
to
Will
was
out
of
keeping
with
his
family
connections
,
and
*NL*
certainly
Mr.
Casaubon
had
a
claim
to
be
consulted
.
He
did
not
speak
,
*NL*
but
merely
bowed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
uncle
,
you
know
,
has
many
projects
.
It
appears
that
he
has
*NL*
bought
one
of
the
Middlemarch
newspapers
,
and
he
has
asked
Mr.
Ladislaw
*NL*
to
stay
in
this
neighborhood
and
conduct
the
paper
for
him
,
besides
*NL*
helping
him
in
other
ways
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
looked
at
her
husband
while
she
spoke
,
but
he
had
at
first
*NL*
blinked
and
finally
closed
his
eyes
,
as
if
to
save
them
;
while
his
lips
*NL*
became
more
tense
.
``
What
is
your
opinion
?
''
she
added
,
rather
timidly
,
*NL*
after
a
slight
pause
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
Mr.
Ladislaw
come
on
purpose
to
ask
my
opinion
?
''
said
Mr.
*NL*
Casaubon
,
opening
his
eyes
narrowly
with
a
knife-edged
look
at
*NL*
Dorothea
.
She
was
really
uncomfortable
on
the
point
he
inquired
about
,
*NL*
but
she
only
became
a
little
more
serious
,
and
her
eyes
did
not
swerve
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
she
answered
immediately
,
``
he
did
not
say
that
he
came
to
ask
*NL*
your
opinion
.
But
when
he
mentioned
the
proposal
,
he
of
course
*NL*
expected
me
to
tell
you
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Casaubon
was
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
feared
that
you
might
feel
some
objection
.
But
certainly
a
young
*NL*
man
with
so
much
talent
might
be
very
useful
to
my
uncle
--
might
help
*NL*
him
to
do
good
in
a
better
way
.
And
Mr.
Ladislaw
wishes
to
have
some
*NL*
fixed
occupation
.
He
has
been
blamed
,
he
says
,
for
not
seeking
*NL*
something
of
that
kind
,
and
he
would
like
to
stay
in
this
neighborhood
*NL*
because
no
one
cares
for
him
elsewhere
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
felt
that
this
was
a
consideration
to
soften
her
husband
.
*NL*
However
,
he
did
not
speak
,
and
she
presently
recurred
to
Dr.
Spanning
*NL*
and
the
Archdeacon
's
breakfast
.
But
there
was
no
longer
sunshine
on
*NL*
these
subjects
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
morning
,
without
Dorothea
's
knowledge
,
Mr.
Casaubon
despatched
*NL*
the
following
letter
,
beginning
``
Dear
Mr.
Ladislaw
''
-LRB-
he
had
always
*NL*
before
addressed
him
as
``
Will
''
-RRB-
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mrs.
Casaubon
informs
me
that
a
proposal
has
been
made
to
you
,
and
*NL*
-LRB-
according
to
an
inference
by
no
means
stretched
-RRB-
has
on
your
part
been
*NL*
in
some
degree
entertained
,
which
involves
your
residence
in
this
*NL*
neighborhood
in
a
capacity
which
I
am
justified
in
saying
touches
my
*NL*
own
position
in
such
a
way
as
renders
it
not
only
natural
and
*NL*
warrantable
in
me
when
that
effect
is
viewed
under
the
influence
of
*NL*
legitimate
feeling
,
but
incumbent
on
me
when
the
same
effect
is
*NL*
considered
in
the
light
of
my
responsibilities
,
to
state
at
once
that
*NL*
your
acceptance
of
the
proposal
above
indicated
would
be
highly
*NL*
offensive
to
me
.
That
I
have
some
claim
to
the
exercise
of
a
veto
*NL*
here
,
would
not
,
I
believe
,
be
denied
by
any
reasonable
person
*NL*
cognizant
of
the
relations
between
us
:
relations
which
,
though
thrown
*NL*
into
the
past
by
your
recent
procedure
,
are
not
thereby
annulled
in
*NL*
their
character
of
determining
antecedents
.
I
will
not
here
make
*NL*
reflections
on
any
person
's
judgment
.
It
is
enough
for
me
to
point
out
*NL*
to
yourself
that
there
are
certain
social
fitnesses
and
proprieties
*NL*
which
should
hinder
a
somewhat
near
relative
of
mine
from
becoming
any
*NL*
wise
conspicuous
in
this
vicinity
in
a
status
not
only
much
beneath
my
*NL*
own
,
but
associated
at
best
with
the
sciolism
of
literary
or
political
*NL*
adventurers
.
At
any
rate
,
the
contrary
issue
must
exclude
you
from
*NL*
further
reception
at
my
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yours
faithfully
,
*NL*
``
EDWARD
CASAUBON

''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
Dorothea
's
mind
was
innocently
at
work
towards
the
further
*NL*
embitterment
of
her
husband
;
dwelling
,
with
a
sympathy
that
grew
to
*NL*
agitation
,
on
what
Will
had
told
her
about
his
parents
and
*NL*
grandparents
.
Any
private
hours
in
her
day
were
usually
spent
in
her
*NL*
blue-green
boudoir
,
and
she
had
come
to
be
very
fond
of
its
pallid
*NL*
quaintness
.
Nothing
had
been
outwardly
altered
there
;
but
while
the
*NL*
summer
had
gradually
advanced
over
the
western
fields
beyond
the
avenue
*NL*
of
elms
,
the
bare
room
had
gathered
within
it
those
memories
of
an
*NL*
inward
life
which
fill
the
air
as
with
a
cloud
of
good
or
bad
angels
,
*NL*
the
invisible
yet
active
forms
of
our
spiritual
triumphs
or
our
*NL*
spiritual
falls
.
She
had
been
so
used
to
struggle
for
and
to
find
*NL*
resolve
in
looking
along
the
avenue
towards
the
arch
of
western
light
*NL*
that
the
vision
itself
had
gained
a
communicating
power
.
Even
the
pale
*NL*
stag
seemed
to
have
reminding
glances
and
to
mean
mutely
,
``
Yes
,
we
*NL*
know
.
''
And
the
group
of
delicately
touched
miniatures
had
made
an
*NL*
audience
as
of
beings
no
longer
disturbed
about
their
own
earthly
lot
,
*NL*
but
still
humanly
interested
.
Especially
the
mysterious
``
Aunt
Julia
''
*NL*
about
whom
Dorothea
had
never
found
it
easy
to
question
her
husband
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
,
since
her
conversation
with
Will
,
many
fresh
images
had
*NL*
gathered
round
that
Aunt
Julia
who
was
Will
's
grandmother
;
the
presence
*NL*
of
that
delicate
miniature
,
so
like
a
living
face
that
she
knew
,
*NL*
helping
to
concentrate
her
feelings
.
What
a
wrong
,
to
cut
off
the
girl
*NL*
from
the
family
protection
and
inheritance
only
because
she
had
chosen
*NL*
a
man
who
was
poor
!
Dorothea
,
early
troubling
her
elders
with
*NL*
questions
about
the
facts
around
her
,
had
wrought
herself
into
some
*NL*
independent
clearness
as
to
the
historical
,
political
reasons
why
*NL*
eldest
sons
had
superior
rights
,
and
why
land
should
be
entailed
:
those
*NL*
reasons
,
impressing
her
with
a
certain
awe
,
might
be
weightier
than
she
*NL*
knew
,
but
here
was
a
question
of
ties
which
left
them
uninfringed
.
*NL*
Here
was
a
daughter
whose
child
--
even
according
to
the
ordinary
aping
*NL*
of
aristocratic
institutions
by
people
who
are
no
more
aristocratic
*NL*
than
retired
grocers
,
and
who
have
no
more
land
to
``
keep
together
''
than
*NL*
a
lawn
and
a
paddock
--
would
have
a
prior
claim
.
Was
inheritance
a
*NL*
question
of
liking
or
of
responsibility
?
All
the
energy
of
Dorothea
's
*NL*
nature
went
on
the
side
of
responsibility
--
the
fulfilment
of
claims
*NL*
founded
on
our
own
deeds
,
such
as
marriage
and
parentage
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
true
,
she
said
to
herself
,
that
Mr.
Casaubon
had
a
debt
to
the
*NL*
Ladislaws
--
that
he
had
to
pay
back
what
the
Ladislaws
had
been
wronged
*NL*
of
.
And
now
she
began
to
think
of
her
husband
's
will
,
which
had
been
*NL*
made
at
the
time
of
their
marriage
,
leaving
the
bulk
of
his
property
to
*NL*
her
,
with
proviso
in
case
of
her
having
children
.
That
ought
to
be
*NL*
altered
;
and
no
time
ought
to
be
lost
.
This
very
question
which
had
*NL*
just
arisen
about
Will
Ladislaw
's
occupation
,
was
the
occasion
for
*NL*
placing
things
on
a
new
,
right
footing
.
Her
husband
,
she
felt
sure
,
*NL*
according
to
all
his
previous
conduct
,
would
be
ready
to
take
the
just
*NL*
view
,
if
she
proposed
it
--
she
,
in
whose
interest
an
unfair
*NL*
concentration
of
the
property
had
been
urged
.
His
sense
of
right
had
*NL*
surmounted
and
would
continue
to
surmount
anything
that
might
be
called
*NL*
antipathy
.
She
suspected
that
her
uncle
's
scheme
was
disapproved
by
*NL*
Mr.
Casaubon
,
and
this
made
it
seem
all
the
more
opportune
that
a
fresh
*NL*
understanding
should
be
begun
,
so
that
instead
of
Will
's
starting
*NL*
penniless
and
accepting
the
first
function
that
offered
itself
,
he
*NL*
should
find
himself
in
possession
of
a
rightful
income
which
should
be
*NL*
paid
by
her
husband
during
his
life
,
and
,
by
an
immediate
alteration
of
*NL*
the
will
,
should
be
secured
at
his
death
.
The
vision
of
all
this
as
*NL*
what
ought
to
be
done
seemed
to
Dorothea
like
a
sudden
letting
in
of
*NL*
daylight
,
waking
her
from
her
previous
stupidity
and
incurious
*NL*
self-absorbed
ignorance
about
her
husband
's
relation
to
others
.
Will
*NL*
Ladislaw
had
refused
Mr.
Casaubon
's
future
aid
on
a
ground
that
no
*NL*
longer
appeared
right
to
her
;
and
Mr.
Casaubon
had
never
himself
seen
*NL*
fully
what
was
the
claim
upon
him
.
``
But
he
will
!
''
said
Dorothea
.
``
The
*NL*
great
strength
of
his
character
lies
here
.
And
what
are
we
doing
with
*NL*
our
money
?
We
make
no
use
of
half
of
our
income
.
My
own
money
buys
me
*NL*
nothing
but
an
uneasy
conscience
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
peculiar
fascination
for
Dorothea
in
this
division
of
*NL*
property
intended
for
herself
,
and
always
regarded
by
her
as
excessive
.
*NL*
She
was
blind
,
you
see
,
to
many
things
obvious
to
others
--
likely
to
*NL*
tread
in
the
wrong
places
,
as
Celia
had
warned
her
;
yet
her
blindness
*NL*
to
whatever
did
not
lie
in
her
own
pure
purpose
carried
her
safely
by
*NL*
the
side
of
precipices
where
vision
would
have
been
perilous
with
fear
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
thoughts
which
had
gathered
vividness
in
the
solitude
of
her
*NL*
boudoir
occupied
her
incessantly
through
the
day
on
which
Mr.
Casaubon
*NL*
had
sent
his
letter
to
Will
.
Everything
seemed
hindrance
to
her
till
*NL*
she
could
find
an
opportunity
of
opening
her
heart
to
her
husband
.
To
*NL*
his
preoccupied
mind
all
subjects
were
to
be
approached
gently
,
and
she
*NL*
had
never
since
his
illness
lost
from
her
consciousness
the
dread
of
*NL*
agitating
him
.
But
when
young
ardor
is
set
brooding
over
the
*NL*
conception
of
a
prompt
deed
,
the
deed
itself
seems
to
start
forth
with
*NL*
independent
life
,
mastering
ideal
obstacles
.
The
day
passed
in
a
*NL*
sombre
fashion
,
not
unusual
,
though
Mr.
Casaubon
was
perhaps
unusually
*NL*
silent
;
but
there
were
hours
of
the
night
which
might
be
counted
on
as
*NL*
opportunities
of
conversation
;
for
Dorothea
,
when
aware
of
her
*NL*
husband
's
sleeplessness
,
had
established
a
habit
of
rising
,
lighting
a
*NL*
candle
,
and
reading
him
to
sleep
again
.
And
this
night
she
was
from
*NL*
the
beginning
sleepless
,
excited
by
resolves
.
He
slept
as
usual
for
a
*NL*
few
hours
,
but
she
had
risen
softly
and
had
sat
in
the
darkness
for
*NL*
nearly
an
hour
before
he
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dorothea
,
since
you
are
up
,
will
you
light
a
candle
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
feel
ill
,
dear
?
''
was
her
first
question
,
as
she
obeyed
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
not
at
all
;
but
I
shall
be
obliged
,
since
you
are
up
,
if
you
will
*NL*
read
me
a
few
pages
of
Lowth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
I
talk
to
you
a
little
instead
?
''
said
Dorothea
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
been
thinking
about
money
all
day
--
that
I
have
always
had
too
*NL*
much
,
and
especially
the
prospect
of
too
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
These
,
my
dear
Dorothea
,
are
providential
arrangements
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
if
one
has
too
much
in
consequence
of
others
being
wronged
,
it
*NL*
seems
to
me
that
the
divine
voice
which
tells
us
to
set
that
wrong
*NL*
right
must
be
obeyed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
my
love
,
is
the
bearing
of
your
remark
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
you
have
been
too
liberal
in
arrangements
for
me
--
I
mean
,
with
*NL*
regard
to
property
;
and
that
makes
me
unhappy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
so
?
I
have
none
but
comparatively
distant
connections
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
been
led
to
think
about
your
aunt
Julia
,
and
how
she
was
left
*NL*
in
poverty
only
because
she
married
a
poor
man
,
an
act
which
was
not
*NL*
disgraceful
,
since
he
was
not
unworthy
.
It
was
on
that
ground
,
I
know
,
*NL*
that
you
educated
Mr.
Ladislaw
and
provided
for
his
mother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
waited
a
few
moments
for
some
answer
that
would
help
her
*NL*
onward
.
None
came
,
and
her
next
words
seemed
the
more
forcible
to
her
,
*NL*
falling
clear
upon
the
dark
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
surely
we
should
regard
his
claim
as
a
much
greater
one
,
even
to
*NL*
the
half
of
that
property
which
I
know
that
you
have
destined
for
me
.
*NL*
And
I
think
he
ought
at
once
to
be
provided
for
on
that
understanding
.
*NL*
It
is
not
right
that
he
should
be
in
the
dependence
of
poverty
while
we
*NL*
are
rich
.
And
if
there
is
any
objection
to
the
proposal
he
mentioned
,
*NL*
the
giving
him
his
true
place
and
his
true
share
would
set
aside
any
*NL*
motive
for
his
accepting
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Ladislaw
has
probably
been
speaking
to
you
on
this
subject
?
''
said
*NL*
Mr.
Casaubon
,
with
a
certain
biting
quickness
not
habitual
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
no
!
''
said
Dorothea
,
earnestly
.
``
How
can
you
imagine
it
,
since
*NL*
he
has
so
lately
declined
everything
from
you
?
I
fear
you
think
too
*NL*
hardly
of
him
,
dear
.
He
only
told
me
a
little
about
his
parents
and
*NL*
grandparents
,
and
almost
all
in
answer
to
my
questions
.
You
are
so
*NL*
good
,
so
just
--
you
have
done
everything
you
thought
to
be
right
.
But
*NL*
it
seems
to
me
clear
that
more
than
that
is
right
;
and
I
must
speak
*NL*
about
it
,
since
I
am
the
person
who
would
get
what
is
called
benefit
by
*NL*
that
`
more
'
not
being
done
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
perceptible
pause
before
Mr.
Casaubon
replied
,
not
quickly
*NL*
as
before
,
but
with
a
still
more
biting
emphasis
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dorothea
,
my
love
,
this
is
not
the
first
occasion
,
but
it
were
well
*NL*
that
it
should
be
the
last
,
on
which
you
have
assumed
a
judgment
on
*NL*
subjects
beyond
your
scope
.
Into
the
question
how
far
conduct
,
*NL*
especially
in
the
matter
of
alliances
,
constitutes
a
forfeiture
of
*NL*
family
claims
,
I
do
not
now
enter
.
Suffice
it
,
that
you
are
not
here
*NL*
qualified
to
discriminate
.
What
I
now
wish
you
to
understand
is
,
that
*NL*
I
accept
no
revision
,
still
less
dictation
within
that
range
of
affairs
*NL*
which
I
have
deliberated
upon
as
distinctly
and
properly
mine
.
It
is
*NL*
not
for
you
to
interfere
between
me
and
Mr.
Ladislaw
,
and
still
less
to
*NL*
encourage
communications
from
him
to
you
which
constitute
a
criticism
*NL*
on
my
procedure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Dorothea
,
shrouded
in
the
darkness
,
was
in
a
tumult
of
conflicting
*NL*
emotions
.
Alarm
at
the
possible
effect
on
himself
of
her
husband
's
*NL*
strongly
manifested
anger
,
would
have
checked
any
expression
of
her
own
*NL*
resentment
,
even
if
she
had
been
quite
free
from
doubt
and
compunction
*NL*
under
the
consciousness
that
there
might
be
some
justice
in
his
last
*NL*
insinuation
.
Hearing
him
breathe
quickly
after
he
had
spoken
,
she
sat
*NL*
listening
,
frightened
,
wretched
--
with
a
dumb
inward
cry
for
help
to
*NL*
bear
this
nightmare
of
a
life
in
which
every
energy
was
arrested
by
*NL*
dread
.
But
nothing
else
happened
,
except
that
they
both
remained
a
*NL*
long
while
sleepless
,
without
speaking
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
,
Mr.
Casaubon
received
the
following
answer
from
Will
*NL*
Ladislaw
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
DEAR
MR.
CASAUBON
,
--
I
have
given
all
due
consideration
to
your
letter
*NL*
of
yesterday
,
but
I
am
unable
to
take
precisely
your
view
of
our
mutual
*NL*
position
.
With
the
fullest
acknowledgment
of
your
generous
conduct
to
*NL*
me
in
the
past
,
I
must
still
maintain
that
an
obligation
of
this
kind
*NL*
can
not
fairly
fetter
me
as
you
appear
to
expect
that
it
should
.
*NL*
Granted
that
a
benefactor
's
wishes
may
constitute
a
claim
;
there
must
*NL*
always
be
a
reservation
as
to
the
quality
of
those
wishes
.
They
may
*NL*
possibly
clash
with
more
imperative
considerations
.
Or
a
benefactor
's
*NL*
veto
might
impose
such
a
negation
on
a
man
's
life
that
the
consequent
*NL*
blank
might
be
more
cruel
than
the
benefaction
was
generous
.
I
am
*NL*
merely
using
strong
illustrations
.
In
the
present
case
I
am
unable
to
*NL*
take
your
view
of
the
bearing
which
my
acceptance
of
occupation
--
not
*NL*
enriching
certainly
,
but
not
dishonorable
--
will
have
on
your
own
*NL*
position
which
seems
to
me
too
substantial
to
be
affected
in
that
*NL*
shadowy
manner
.
And
though
I
do
not
believe
that
any
change
in
our
*NL*
relations
will
occur
-LRB-
certainly
none
has
yet
occurred
-RRB-
which
can
*NL*
nullify
the
obligations
imposed
on
me
by
the
past
,
pardon
me
for
not
*NL*
seeing
that
those
obligations
should
restrain
me
from
using
the
*NL*
ordinary
freedom
of
living
where
I
choose
,
and
maintaining
myself
by
*NL*
any
lawful
occupation
I
may
choose
.
Regretting
that
there
exists
this
*NL*
difference
between
us
as
to
a
relation
in
which
the
conferring
of
*NL*
benefits
has
been
entirely
on
your
side
--
*NL*
*NL*
I
remain
,
yours
with
persistent
obligation
,
*NL*
WILL
LADISLAW
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Mr.
Casaubon
felt
-LRB-
and
must
not
we
,
being
impartial
,
feel
with
him
*NL*
a
little
?
-RRB-
that
no
man
had
juster
cause
for
disgust
and
suspicion
than
*NL*
he
.
Young
Ladislaw
,
he
was
sure
,
meant
to
defy
and
annoy
him
,
meant
to
*NL*
win
Dorothea
's
confidence
and
sow
her
mind
with
disrespect
,
and
perhaps
*NL*
aversion
,
towards
her
husband
.
Some
motive
beneath
the
surface
had
*NL*
been
needed
to
account
for
Will
's
sudden
change
of
course
in
rejecting
Mr.
*NL*
Casaubon
's
aid
and
quitting
his
travels
;
and
this
defiant
determination
*NL*
to
fix
himself
in
the
neighborhood
by
taking
up
something
so
much
at
*NL*
variance
with
his
former
choice
as
Mr.
Brooke
's
Middlemarch
projects
,
*NL*
revealed
clearly
enough
that
the
undeclared
motive
had
relation
to
*NL*
Dorothea
.
Not
for
one
moment
did
Mr.
Casaubon
suspect
Dorothea
of
any
*NL*
doubleness
:
he
had
no
suspicions
of
her
,
but
he
had
-LRB-
what
was
little
*NL*
less
uncomfortable
-RRB-
the
positive
knowledge
that
her
tendency
to
form
*NL*
opinions
about
her
husband
's
conduct
was
accompanied
with
a
disposition
*NL*
to
regard
Will
Ladislaw
favorably
and
be
influenced
by
what
he
said
.
*NL*
His
own
proud
reticence
had
prevented
him
from
ever
being
undeceived
in
*NL*
the
supposition
that
Dorothea
had
originally
asked
her
uncle
to
invite
*NL*
Will
to
his
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
,
on
receiving
Will
's
letter
,
Mr.
Casaubon
had
to
consider
his
*NL*
duty
.
He
would
never
have
been
easy
to
call
his
action
anything
else
*NL*
than
duty
;
but
in
this
case
,
contending
motives
thrust
him
back
into
*NL*
negations
.
*NL*
*NL*
Should
he
apply
directly
to
Mr.
Brooke
,
and
demand
of
that
troublesome
*NL*
gentleman
to
revoke
his
proposal
?
Or
should
he
consult
Sir
James
*NL*
Chettam
,
and
get
him
to
concur
in
remonstrance
against
a
step
which
*NL*
touched
the
whole
family
?
In
either
case
Mr.
Casaubon
was
aware
that
*NL*
failure
was
just
as
probable
as
success
.
It
was
impossible
for
him
to
*NL*
mention
Dorothea
's
name
in
the
matter
,
and
without
some
alarming
*NL*
urgency
Mr.
Brooke
was
as
likely
as
not
,
after
meeting
all
*NL*
representations
with
apparent
assent
,
to
wind
up
by
saying
,
``
Never
*NL*
fear
,
Casaubon
!
Depend
upon
it
,
young
Ladislaw
will
do
you
credit
.
*NL*
Depend
upon
it
,
I
have
put
my
finger
on
the
right
thing
.
''
And
Mr.
*NL*
Casaubon
shrank
nervously
from
communicating
on
the
subject
with
Sir
*NL*
James
Chettam
,
between
whom
and
himself
there
had
never
been
any
*NL*
cordiality
,
and
who
would
immediately
think
of
Dorothea
without
any
*NL*
mention
of
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Mr.
Casaubon
was
distrustful
of
everybody
's
feeling
towards
him
,
*NL*
especially
as
a
husband
.
To
let
any
one
suppose
that
he
was
jealous
*NL*
would
be
to
admit
their
-LRB-
suspected
-RRB-
view
of
his
disadvantages
:
to
let
*NL*
them
know
that
he
did
not
find
marriage
particularly
blissful
would
*NL*
imply
his
conversion
to
their
-LRB-
probably
-RRB-
earlier
disapproval
.
It
would
*NL*
be
as
bad
as
letting
Carp
,
and
Brasenose
generally
,
know
how
backward
*NL*
he
was
in
organizing
the
matter
for
his
``
Key
to
all
Mythologies
.
''
All
*NL*
through
his
life
Mr.
Casaubon
had
been
trying
not
to
admit
even
to
*NL*
himself
the
inward
sores
of
self-doubt
and
jealousy
.
And
on
the
most
*NL*
delicate
of
all
personal
subjects
,
the
habit
of
proud
suspicious
*NL*
reticence
told
doubly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
Mr.
Casaubon
remained
proudly
,
bitterly
silent
.
But
he
had
*NL*
forbidden
Will
to
come
to
Lowick
Manor
,
and
he
was
mentally
preparing
*NL*
other
measures
of
frustration
.

for

lounging

Whiggish

hoists
Brougham
and
Useful
Knowledge

that
's
the
worst
I
know
of
*NL*
him
;

and
he
says
that
Brooke
is
getting
up
a
pretty
strong
party
.
*NL*
Bulstrode
,
the
banker
,
is
his
foremost
man

But
he
thinks
Brooke
would
*NL*
come
off
badly
at
a
nomination

*NL*
*NL*
``
Exactly
,

said
Sir
James
,
with
earnestness
.
``
I
have
been
inquiring
*NL*
into
the
thing
,
for
I
've
never
known
anything
about
Middlemarch
*NL*
politics
before
--
the
county
being
my
business
.
What
Brooke
trusts
to
,
*NL*
is
that
they
are
going
to
turn
out
Oliver
because
he
is
a
Peelite
.
But
*NL*
Hawley
tells
me
that
if
they
send
up
a
Whig
at
all
it
is
sure
to
be
*NL*
Bagster
,
one
of
those
candidates
who
come
from
heaven
knows
where
,
but
*NL*
dead
against
Ministers
,
and
an
experienced
Parliamentary
man
.
Hawley
's
*NL*
rather
rough
:
he
forgot
that
he
was
speaking
to
me
.
He
said
if
Brooke
*NL*
wanted
a
pelting
,
he
could
get
it
cheaper
than
by
going
to
the
*NL*
hustings

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
warned
you
all
of
it

said
Mrs.
Cadwallader

waving
her
hands
*NL*
outward

``
I
said
to
Humphrey
long

make
a

And
now
he
has
done
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

he
might
have
taken
it
into
his
head

said
the
Rector

*NL*
``
That
would
have
been
a
graver
mess

a
little
flirtation

*NL*
``
He
may
do
that
afterwards

said
Mrs.
Cadwallader

come

out
on

ague

Sir

Of

I
care
the
more

he
's
getting
on
in
life

now
,

I
do
n't
like
to
think
of
his
exposing
himself

They
will
be

raking
up
everything

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
it

no

such
an

*NL*
*NL*

Well

no

said
Sir

``
I

I

Brooke

Ladislaw
seems
clever
enough
for
anything

I
thought
it

as
well
to
hear
what
he
had
to

he
is
against

I

this

again

had
him
two

now
I
find
*NL*

's
in
everybody

in
Middlemarch

the
editor

There

with

it
strikes
me

And
Thomas

I
saw
him
the

One

he
told

point-blank
that

seldom

did
mischief

meddled

he
said

roars
himself
red
at

boroughs

and
does
*NL*
not
mind
if
every
field
on
his
farms
has
a
rotten
gate

a
man
very
*NL*
open-hearted
to
Leeds

no

out
of

a
little
return
on

to

help
a

to
buy
stock

an
outlay
on
repairs

keep
the

out

increases
directly
as

so
on

what

ended
the
Rector
,
*NL*
throwing
down
the
paper
,
and
clasping
his
hands
at
the
back
of
his

head
,

he
looked
at
Mr.

with
an
air
of

neutrality

*NL*
*NL*
``
Come

good

said
Mr.

,
taking
up
the

paper
and
trying
to
bear
the
attack
as
easily
as
his
neighbor
did
,
but
*NL*
coloring
and
smiling
rather
nervously
;
``
that
about
roaring
himself
red

I
never

as
to
roaring
myself
red

these

carefully

choke

carte

my
view

said
the
Rector
,
broadening
himself
by
sticking
*NL*
his
thumbs
in
his
armholes
,
and
laughing
towards
Mr.
Brooke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
a
showy
sort
of
thing

do

know

said
Mr.

``
But
*NL*
I
should
like
you
to
tell
me
of
another
landlord

has
distressed
his

tenants

arrears
as
little
as
I
have
.
I
let

old

stay

I
take
my

*NL*
After
that
,
Mr.
Brooke
remembered
that
there
was
a
packet
which
he
had
*NL*
omitted
to
send
off
from
the
Grange
,
and
he
bade
everybody
hurriedly
*NL*
good-by
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
want
to
take
a
liberty
with
Brooke

''
said
Sir
James
;
``
I
see
*NL*
he
is
nettled
.
But
as
to
what
he
says
about
old
tenants
,
in
point
of
*NL*
fact
no
new
tenant
would
take
the
farms
on
the
present
terms
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
a
notion
that
he
will
be
brought
round
in
time

said
the
*NL*
Rector
.
``
But
you
were
pulling
one
way

Elinor

we
were
pulling

another

You
wanted

frighten
him
away
from
expense
,
and
we
want
to
*NL*
frighten
him
into
it

Better
let
him
try
to
be
popular
and
see
that
*NL*
his
character
as
a
landlord
stands
in
his
way

I
do
n't
think

two
straws
about
the

Pioneer
,

or
Ladislaw
,
or
Brooke
's
*NL*
speechifying
to
the
Middlemarchers

it
does
signify
about
the

Tipton
being
comfortable

*NL*
``
Excuse
me

it
is
you
two

pulled
together

If

a-horseback

warn

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
James
Chettam
's
mind
was
not
fruitful
in
devices
,
but
his
growing
*NL*
anxiety
to
``
act
on
Brooke
,
''
once
brought
close
to
his
constant
belief
*NL*
in
Dorothea
's
capacity
for
influence
,
became
formative
,
and
issued
in
a
*NL*
little
plan
;
namely
,
to
plead
Celia
's
indisposition
as
a
reason
for
*NL*
fetching
Dorothea
by
herself
to
the
Hall
,
and
to
leave
her
at
the
*NL*
Grange
with
the
carriage
on
the
way
,
after
making
her
fully
aware
of
*NL*
the
situation
concerning
the
management
of
the
estate
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
way
it
happened
that
one
day
near
four
o'clock
,
when
Mr.
Brooke
*NL*
and
Ladislaw
were
seated
in
the
library
,
the
door
opened
and
Mrs.
*NL*
Casaubon
was
announced
.
*NL*
*NL*
Will
,
the
moment
before
,
had
been
low
in
the
depths
of
boredom
,
and
,
*NL*
obliged
to
help
Mr.
Brooke
in
arranging
``
documents
''
about
hanging
*NL*
sheep-stealers
,
was
exemplifying
the
power
our
minds
have
of
riding
*NL*
several
horses
at
once
by
inwardly
arranging
measures
towards
getting
a
*NL*
lodging
for
himself
in
Middlemarch
and
cutting
short
his
constant
*NL*
residence
at
the
Grange
;
while
there
flitted
through
all
these
steadier
*NL*
images
a
tickling
vision
of
a
sheep-stealing
epic
written
with
Homeric
*NL*
particularity
.
When
Mrs.
Casaubon
was
announced
he
started
up
as
from
*NL*
an
electric
shock
,
and
felt
a
tingling
at
his
finger-ends
.
Any
one
*NL*
observing
him
would
have
seen
a
change
in
his
complexion
,
in
the
*NL*
adjustment
of
his
facial
muscles
,
in
the
vividness
of
his
glance
,
which
*NL*
might
have
made
them
imagine
that
every
molecule
in
his
body
had
passed
*NL*
the
message
of
a
magic
touch
.
And
so
it
had
.
For
effective
magic
is
*NL*
transcendent
nature
;
and
who
shall
measure
the
subtlety
of
those
*NL*
touches
which
convey
the
quality
of
soul
as
well
as
body
,
and
make
a
*NL*
man
's
passion
for
one
woman
differ
from
his
passion
for
another
as
joy
*NL*
in
the
morning
light
over
valley
and
river
and
white
mountain-top
*NL*
differs
from
joy
among
Chinese
lanterns
and
glass
panels
?
Will
,
too
,
*NL*
was
made
of
very
impressible
stuff
.
The
bow
of
a
violin
drawn
near
him
*NL*
cleverly
,
would
at
one
stroke
change
the
aspect
of
the
world
for
him
,
*NL*
and
his
point
of
view
shifted
--
as
easily
as
his
mood
.
Dorothea
's
*NL*
entrance
was
the
freshness
of
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
my
dear
,
this
is
pleasant
,
now
,
''
said
Mr.
Brooke
,
meeting
and
*NL*
kissing
her
.
``
You
have
left
Casaubon
with
his
books
,
I
suppose
.
*NL*
That
's
right
.
We
must
not
have
you
getting
too
learned
for
a
woman
,
*NL*
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
no
fear
of
that
,
uncle
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
turning
to
Will
and
*NL*
shaking
hands
with
open
cheerfulness
,
while
she
made
no
other
form
of
*NL*
greeting
,
but
went
on
answering
her
uncle
.
``
I
am
very
slow
.
When
I
*NL*
want
to
be
busy
with
books
,
I
am
often
playing
truant
among
my
*NL*
thoughts
.
I
find
it
is
not
so
easy
to
be
learned
as
to
plan
cottages
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
seated
herself
beside
her
uncle
opposite
to
Will
,
and
was
evidently
*NL*
preoccupied
with
something
that
made
her
almost
unmindful
of
him
.
He
*NL*
was
ridiculously
disappointed
,
as
if
he
had
imagined
that
her
coming
*NL*
had
anything
to
do
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
yes

my
dear
,
it
was
quite
your
hobby

draw
plans

But
it
was

good
to
break
that
off
a
little

ran
away

never
let
myself

run
away

always
pulled
up

That

what
I
tell
Ladislaw

and
I
are
alike

know

likes
to
go

into
everything

We
are

*NL*
great
deal
together
,
Ladislaw
and
I.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
with
characteristic
directness
,
``
Sir
James
has
*NL*
been
telling
me
that
he
is
in
hope
of
seeing
a
great
change
made
soon
*NL*
in
your
management
of
the
estate
--
that
you
are
thinking
of
having
the
*NL*
farms
valued
,
and
repairs
made
,
and
the
cottages
improved
,
so
that
*NL*
Tipton
may
look
quite
another
place
.
Oh
,
how
happy
!
''
--
she
went
on
,
*NL*
clasping
her
hands
,
with
a
return
to
that
more
childlike
impetuous
*NL*
manner
,
which
had
been
subdued
since
her
marriage
.
``
If
I
were
at
home
*NL*
still
,
I
should
take
to
riding
again
,
that
I
might
go
about
with
you
*NL*
and
see
all
that
!
And
you
are
going
to
engage
Mr.
Garth
,
who
praised
*NL*
my
cottages
,
Sir
James
says
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Chettam
is
a
little
hasty
,
my
dear
,
''
said
Mr.
Brooke
,
coloring
*NL*
slightly
;
``
a
little
hasty
,
you
know
.
I
never
said
I
should
do
anything
*NL*
of
the
kind
.
I
never
said
I
should
_
not
_
do
it
,
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
only
feels
confident
that
you
will
do
it
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
in
a
*NL*
voice
as
clear
and
unhesitating
as
that
of
a
young
chorister
chanting
a
*NL*
credo
,
``
because
you
mean
to
enter
Parliament
as
a
member
who
cares
for
*NL*
the
improvement
of
the
people
,
and
one
of
the
first
things
to
be
made
*NL*
better
is
the
state
of
the
land
and
the
laborers
.
Think
of
Kit
Downes
,
*NL*
uncle
,
who
lives
with
his
wife
and
seven
children
in
a
house
with
one
*NL*
sitting
room
and
one
bedroom
hardly
larger
than
this
table
!
--
and
those
*NL*
poor
Dagleys
,
in
their
tumble-down
farmhouse
,
where
they
live
in
the
*NL*
back
kitchen
and
leave
the
other
rooms
to
the
rats
!
That
is
one
reason
*NL*
why
I
did
not
like
the
pictures
here
,
dear
uncle
--
which
you
think
me
*NL*
stupid
about
.
I
used
to
come
from
the
village
with
all
that
dirt
and
*NL*
coarse
ugliness
like
a
pain
within
me
,
and
the
simpering
pictures
in
*NL*
the
drawing-room
seemed
to
me
like
a
wicked
attempt
to
find
delight
in
*NL*
what
is
false
,
while
we
do
n't
mind
how
hard
the
truth
is
for
the
*NL*
neighbors
outside
our
walls
.
I
think
we
have
no
right
to
come
forward
*NL*
and
urge
wider
changes
for
good
,
until
we
have
tried
to
alter
the
evils
*NL*
which
lie
under
our
own
hands
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
had
gathered
emotion
as
she
went
on
,
and
had
forgotten
*NL*
everything
except
the
relief
of
pouring
forth
her
feelings
,
unchecked
:
*NL*
an
experience
once
habitual
with
her
,
but
hardly
ever
present
since
her
*NL*
marriage
,
which
had
been
a
perpetual
struggle
of
energy
with
fear
.
For
*NL*
the
moment
,
Will
's
admiration
was
accompanied
with
a
chilling
sense
of
*NL*
remoteness
.
A
man
is
seldom
ashamed
of
feeling
that
he
can
not
love
a
*NL*
woman
so
well
when
he
sees
a
certain
greatness
in
her
:
nature
having
*NL*
intended
greatness
for
men
.
But
nature
has
sometimes
made
sad
*NL*
oversights
in
carrying
out
her
intention
;
as
in
the
case
of
good
Mr.
*NL*
Brooke
,
whose
masculine
consciousness
was
at
this
moment
in
rather
a
*NL*
stammering
condition
under
the
eloquence
of
his
niece
.
He
could
not
*NL*
immediately
find
any
other
mode
of
expressing
himself
than
that
of
*NL*
rising
,
fixing
his
eye-glass
,
and
fingering
the
papers
before
him
.
At
*NL*
last
he
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
something
in
what
you
say
,
my
dear
,
something
in
what
you
*NL*
say
--
but
not
everything
--
eh
,
Ladislaw
?
You
and
I
do
n't
like
our
*NL*
pictures
and
statues
being
found
fault
with
.
Young
ladies
are
a
little
*NL*
ardent
,
you
know
--
a
little
one-sided
,
my
dear
.
Fine
art
,
poetry
,
that
*NL*
kind
of
thing
,
elevates
a
nation
--
emollit
mores
--
you
understand
a
*NL*
little
Latin
now
.
But
--
eh
?
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
These
interrogatives
were
addressed
to
the
footman
who
had
come
in
to
*NL*
say
that
the
keeper
had
found
one
of
Dagley
's
boys
with
a
leveret
in
*NL*
his
hand
just
killed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
come
,
I
'll
come
.
I
shall
let
him
off
easily
,
you
know
,
''
said
Mr.
*NL*
Brooke
aside
to
Dorothea
,
shuffling
away
very
cheerfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
you
feel
how
right
this
change
is
that
I
--
that
Sir
James
wishes
*NL*
for
,
''
said
Dorothea
to
Will
,
as
soon
as
her
uncle
was
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
,
now
I
have
heard
you
speak
about
it
.
I
shall
not
forget
what
*NL*
you
have
said
.
But
can
you
think
of
something
else
at
this
moment
?
I
*NL*
may
not
have
another
opportunity
of
speaking
to
you
about
what
has
*NL*
occurred
,
''
said
Will
,
rising
with
a
movement
of
impatience
,
and
holding
*NL*
the
back
of
his
chair
with
both
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pray
tell
me
what
it
is
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
anxiously
,
also
rising
and
*NL*
going
to
the
open
window
,
where
Monk
was
looking
in
,
panting
and
*NL*
wagging
his
tail
.
She
leaned
her
back
against
the
window-frame
,
and
*NL*
laid
her
hand
on
the
dog
's
head
;
for
though
,
as
we
know
,
she
was
not
*NL*
fond
of
pets
that
must
be
held
in
the
hands
or
trodden
on
,
she
was
*NL*
always
attentive
to
the
feelings
of
dogs
,
and
very
polite
if
she
had
to
*NL*
decline
their
advances
.
*NL*
*NL*
Will
followed
her
only
with
his
eyes
and
said
,
``
I
presume
you
know
that
*NL*
Mr.
Casaubon
has
forbidden
me
to
go
to
his
house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
did
not
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
after
a
moment
's
pause
.
She
was
*NL*
evidently
much
moved
.
``
I
am
very
,
very
sorry
,
''
she
added
,
mournfully
.
*NL*
She
was
thinking
of
what
Will
had
no
knowledge
of
--
the
conversation
*NL*
between
her
and
her
husband
in
the
darkness
;
and
she
was
anew
smitten
*NL*
with
hopelessness
that
she
could
influence
Mr.
Casaubon
's
action
.
But
*NL*
the
marked
expression
of
her
sorrow
convinced
Will
that
it
was
not
all
*NL*
given
to
him
personally
,
and
that
Dorothea
had
not
been
visited
by
the
*NL*
idea
that
Mr.
Casaubon
's
dislike
and
jealousy
of
him
turned
upon
*NL*
herself
.
He
felt
an
odd
mixture
of
delight
and
vexation
:
of
delight
*NL*
that
he
could
dwell
and
be
cherished
in
her
thought
as
in
a
pure
home
,
*NL*
without
suspicion
and
without
stint
--
of
vexation
because
he
was
of
too
*NL*
little
account
with
her
,
was
not
formidable
enough
,
was
treated
with
an
*NL*
unhesitating
benevolence
which
did
not
flatter
him
.
But
his
dread
of
*NL*
any
change
in
Dorothea
was
stronger
than
his
discontent
,
and
he
began
*NL*
to
speak
again
in
a
tone
of
mere
explanation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Casaubon
's
reason
is
,
his
displeasure
at
my
taking
a
position
here
*NL*
which
he
considers
unsuited
to
my
rank
as
his
cousin
.
I
have
told
him
*NL*
that
I
can
not
give
way
on
this
point
.
It
is
a
little
too
hard
on
me
to
*NL*
expect
that
my
course
in
life
is
to
be
hampered
by
prejudices
which
I
*NL*
think
ridiculous
.
Obligation
may
be
stretched
till
it
is
no
better
*NL*
than
a
brand
of
slavery
stamped
on
us
when
we
were
too
young
to
know
*NL*
its
meaning
.
I
would
not
have
accepted
the
position
if
I
had
not
meant
*NL*
to
make
it
useful
and
honorable
.
I
am
not
bound
to
regard
family
*NL*
dignity
in
any
other
light
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
felt
wretched
.
She
thought
her
husband
altogether
in
the
*NL*
wrong
,
on
more
grounds
than
Will
had
mentioned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
better
for
us
not
to
speak
on
the
subject
,
''
she
said
,
with
a
*NL*
tremulousness
not
common
in
her
voice
,
``
since
you
and
Mr.
Casaubon
*NL*
disagree
.
You
intend
to
remain
?
''
She
was
looking
out
on
the
lawn
,
*NL*
with
melancholy
meditation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
but
I
shall
hardly
ever
see
you
now
,
''
said
Will
,
in
a
tone
of
*NL*
almost
boyish
complaint
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
turning
her
eyes
full
upon
him
,
``
hardly
ever
.
But
*NL*
I
shall
hear
of
you
.
I
shall
know
what
you
are
doing
for
my
uncle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
know
hardly
anything
about
you
,
''
said
Will
.
``
No
one
will
tell
*NL*
me
anything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
life
is
very
simple
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
her
lips
curling
with
an
*NL*
exquisite
smile
,
which
irradiated
her
melancholy
.
``
I
am
always
at
*NL*
Lowick
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
a
dreadful
imprisonment
,
''
said
Will
,
impetuously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
do
n't
think
that
,
''
said
Dorothea
.
``
I
have
no
longings
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
speak
,
but
she
replied
to
some
change
in
his
expression
.
``
I
*NL*
mean
,
for
myself
.
Except
that
I
should
like
not
to
have
so
much
more
*NL*
than
my
share
without
doing
anything
for
others
.
But
I
have
a
belief
*NL*
of
my
own
,
and
it
comforts
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
that
?
''
said
Will
,
rather
jealous
of
the
belief
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
by
desiring
what
is
perfectly
good
,
even
when
we
do
n't
quite
know
*NL*
what
it
is
and
can
not
do
what
we
would
,
we
are
part
of
the
divine
power
*NL*
against
evil
--
widening
the
skirts
of
light
and
making
the
struggle
with
*NL*
darkness
narrower
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
a
beautiful
mysticism
--
it
is
a

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Please
not
to
call
it
by
any
name
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
putting
out
her
*NL*
hands
entreatingly
.
``
You
will
say
it
is
Persian
,
or
something
else
*NL*
geographical
.
It
is
my
life
.
I
have
found
it
out
,
and
can
not
part
*NL*
with
it
.
I
have
always
been
finding
out
my
religion
since
I
was
a
*NL*
little
girl
.
I
used
to
pray
so
much
--
now
I
hardly
ever
pray
.
I
try
*NL*
not
to
have
desires
merely
for
myself
,
because
they
may
not
be
good
for
*NL*
others
,
and
I
have
too
much
already
.
I
only
told
you
,
that
you
might
*NL*
know
quite
well
how
my
days
go
at
Lowick
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
bless
you
for
telling
me
!
''
said
Will
,
ardently
,
and
rather
*NL*
wondering
at
himself
.
They
were
looking
at
each
other
like
two
fond
*NL*
children
who
were
talking
confidentially
of
birds
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
_
your
_
religion
?
''
said
Dorothea
.
``
I
mean
--
not
what
you
know
*NL*
about
religion
,
but
the
belief
that
helps
you
most
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
love
what
is
good
and
beautiful
when
I
see
it
,
''
said
Will
.
``
But
I
*NL*
am
a
rebel
:
I
do
n't
feel
bound
,
as
you
do
,
to
submit
to
what
I
do
n't
*NL*
like

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
if
you
like
what
is
good
,
that
comes
to
the
same
thing

said
*NL*
Dorothea
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
you
are
subtle
,

said
Will
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
Mr.
Casaubon
often
says
I
am
too
subtle

I
do
n't
feel
as
if
I
*NL*
were
subtle

''
said
Dorothea
,
playfully
.
``
But
how
long
my
uncle
is
!
I
*NL*
must
go
and
look
for
him
.
I
must
really
go
on
to
the
Hall
.
Celia
is
*NL*
expecting
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Will
offered
to
tell
Mr.
Brooke
,
who
presently
came
and
said
that
he
*NL*
would
step
into
the
carriage
and
go
with
Dorothea
as
far
as
Dagley
's
,
*NL*
to
speak
about
the
small
delinquent
who
had
been
caught
with
the
*NL*
leveret
.
Dorothea
renewed
the
subject
of
the
estate
as
they
drove
*NL*
along
,
but
Mr.
Brooke
,
not
being
taken
unawares
,
got
the
talk
under
his
*NL*
own
control
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Chettam
,
now
,
''
he
replied
;
``
he
finds
fault
with
me
,
my
dear
;
but
I
*NL*
should
not
preserve
my
game
if
it
were
not
for
Chettam
,
and
he
ca
n't
*NL*
say
that
that
expense
is
for
the
sake
of
the
tenants
,
you
know
.
It
's
a
*NL*
little
against
my
feeling
:
--
poaching
,
now
,
if
you
come
to
look
into
*NL*
it
--
I
have
often
thought
of
getting
up
the
subject
.
Not
long
ago
,
*NL*
Flavell
,
the
Methodist
preacher
,
was
brought
up
for
knocking
down
a
*NL*
hare
that
came
across
his
path
when
he
and
his
wife
were
walking
out
*NL*
together
.
He
was
pretty
quick
,
and
knocked
it
on
the
neck
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
was
very
brutal
,
I
think
,
''
said
Dorothea
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
now
,
it
seemed
rather
black
to
me
,
I
confess
,
in
a
Methodist
*NL*
preacher
,
you
know
.
And
Johnson
said
,
`
You
may
judge
what
a
*NL*
_
hypocrite
_
he
is
.
'
And
upon
my
word
,
I
thought
Flavell
looked
very
*NL*
little
like
`
the
highest
style
of
man
'
--
as
somebody
calls
the
*NL*
Christian
--
Young
,
the
poet
Young
,
I
think
--
you
know
Young
?
Well
,
now
,
*NL*
Flavell
in
his
shabby
black
gaiters
,
pleading
that
he
thought
the
Lord
*NL*
had
sent
him
and
his
wife
a
good
dinner
,
and
he
had
a
right
to
knock
it
*NL*
down
,
though
not
a
mighty
hunter
before
the
Lord
,
as
Nimrod
was
--
I
*NL*
assure
you
it
was
rather
comic
:
Fielding
would
have
made
something
of
*NL*
it
--
or
Scott
,
now
--
Scott
might
have
worked
it
up
.
But
really
,
when
I
*NL*
came
to
think
of
it
,
I
could
n't
help
liking
that
the
fellow
should
have
*NL*
a
bit
of
hare
to
say
grace
over
.
It
's
all
a
matter
of
*NL*
prejudice
--
prejudice
with
the
law
on
its
side
,
you
know
--
about
the
*NL*
stick
and
the
gaiters
,
and
so
on
.
However
,
it
does
n't
do
to
reason
*NL*
about
things
;
and
law
is
law
.
But
I
got
Johnson
to
be
quiet
,
and
I
*NL*
hushed
the
matter
up
.
I
doubt
whether
Chettam
would
not
have
been
more
*NL*
severe
,
and
yet
he
comes
down
on
me
as
if
I
were
the
hardest
man
in
the
*NL*
county
.
But
here
we
are
at
Dagley
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Brooke
got
down
at
a
farmyard-gate
,
and
Dorothea
drove
on
.
It
is
*NL*
wonderful
how
much
uglier
things
will
look
when
we
only
suspect
that
we
*NL*
are
blamed
for
them
.
Even
our
own
persons
in
the
glass
are
apt
to
*NL*
change
their
aspect
for
us
after
we
have
heard
some
frank
remark
on
*NL*
their
less
admirable
points
;
and
on
the
other
hand
it
is
astonishing
*NL*
how
pleasantly
conscience
takes
our
encroachments
on
those
who
never
*NL*
complain
or
have
nobody
to
complain
for
them
.
Dagley
's
homestead
never
*NL*
before
looked
so
dismal
to
Mr.
Brooke
as
it
did
today
,
with
his
mind
*NL*
thus
sore
about
the
fault-finding
of
the
``
Trumpet
,
''
echoed
by
Sir
James
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
true
that
an
observer
,
under
that
softening
influence
of
the
fine
*NL*
arts
which
makes
other
people
's
hardships
picturesque
,
might
have
been
*NL*
delighted
with
this
homestead
called
Freeman
's
End
:
the
old
house
had
*NL*
dormer-windows
in
the
dark
red
roof
,
two
of
the
chimneys
were
choked
*NL*
with
ivy
,
the
large
porch
was
blocked
up
with
bundles
of
sticks
,
and
*NL*
half
the
windows
were
closed
with
gray
worm-eaten
shutters
about
which
*NL*
the
jasmine-boughs
grew
in
wild
luxuriance
;
the
mouldering
garden
wall
*NL*
with
hollyhocks
peeping
over
it
was
a
perfect
study
of
highly
mingled
*NL*
subdued
color
,
and
there
was
an
aged
goat
-LRB-
kept
doubtless
on
*NL*
interesting
superstitious
grounds
-RRB-
lying
against
the
open
back-kitchen
*NL*
door
.
The
mossy
thatch
of
the
cow-shed
,
the
broken
gray
barn-doors
,
*NL*
the
pauper
laborers
in
ragged
breeches
who
had
nearly
finished
*NL*
unloading
a
wagon
of
corn
into
the
barn
ready
for
early
thrashing
;
the
*NL*
scanty
dairy
of
cows
being
tethered
for
milking
and
leaving
one
half
of
*NL*
the
shed
in
brown
emptiness
;
the
very
pigs
and
white
ducks
seeming
to
*NL*
wander
about
the
uneven
neglected
yard
as
if
in
low
spirits
from
*NL*
feeding
on
a
too
meagre
quality
of
rinsings
,
--
all
these
objects
under
*NL*
the
quiet
light
of
a
sky
marbled
with
high
clouds
would
have
made
a
*NL*
sort
of
picture
which
we
have
all
paused
over
as
a
``
charming
bit
,
''
*NL*
touching
other
sensibilities
than
those
which
are
stirred
by
the
*NL*
depression
of
the
agricultural
interest
,
with
the
sad
lack
of
farming
*NL*
capital
,
as
seen
constantly
in
the
newspapers
of
that
time
.
But
these
*NL*
troublesome
associations
were
just
now
strongly
present
to
Mr.
Brooke
,
*NL*
and
spoiled
the
scene
for
him
.
Mr.
Dagley
himself
made
a
figure
in
the
*NL*
landscape
,
carrying
a
pitchfork
and
wearing
his
milking-hat
--
a
very
old
*NL*
beaver
flattened
in
front
.
His
coat
and
breeches
were
the
best
he
had
,
*NL*
and
he
would
not
have
been
wearing
them
on
this
weekday
occasion
if
he
*NL*
had
not
been
to
market
and
returned
later
than
usual
,
having
given
*NL*
himself
the
rare
treat
of
dining
at
the
public
table
of
the
Blue
Bull
.
*NL*
How
he
came
to
fall
into
this
extravagance
would
perhaps
be
matter
of
*NL*
wonderment
to
himself
on
the
morrow
;
but
before
dinner
something
in
the
*NL*
state
of
the
country
,
a
slight
pause
in
the
harvest
before
the
Far
Dips
*NL*
were
cut
,
the
stories
about
the
new
King
and
the
numerous
handbills
on
*NL*
the
walls
,
had
seemed
to
warrant
a
little
recklessness
.
It
was
a
maxim
*NL*
about
Middlemarch
,
and
regarded
as
self-evident
,
that
good
meat
should
*NL*
have
good
drink
,
which
last
Dagley
interpreted
as
plenty
of
table
ale
*NL*
well
followed
up
by
rum-and-water
.
These
liquors
have
so
far
truth
in
*NL*
them
that
they
were
not
false
enough
to
make
poor
Dagley
seem
merry
:
*NL*
they
only
made
his
discontent
less
tongue-tied
than
usual
.
He
had
also
*NL*
taken
too
much
in
the
shape
of
muddy
political
talk
,
a
stimulant
*NL*
dangerously
disturbing
to
his
farming
conservatism
,
which
consisted
in
*NL*
holding
that
whatever
is
,
is
bad
,
and
any
change
is
likely
to
be
worse
.
*NL*
He
was
flushed
,
and
his
eyes
had
a
decidedly
quarrelsome
stare
as
he
*NL*
stood
still
grasping
his
pitchfork
,
while
the
landlord
approached
with
*NL*
his
easy
shuffling
walk
,
one
hand
in
his
trouser-pocket
and
the
other
*NL*
swinging
round
a
thin
walking-stick
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dagley
,
my
good
fellow
,
''
began
Mr.
Brooke
,
conscious
that
he
was
going
*NL*
to
be
very
friendly
about
the
boy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
ay
,
I
'm
a
good
feller
,
am
I
?
Thank
ye
,
sir
,
thank
ye
,
''
said
*NL*
Dagley
,
with
a
loud
snarling
irony
which
made
Fag
the
sheep-dog
stir
*NL*
from
his
seat
and
prick
his
ears
;
but
seeing
Monk
enter
the
yard
after
*NL*
some
outside
loitering
,
Fag
seated
himself
again
in
an
attitude
of
*NL*
observation
.
``
I
'm
glad
to
hear
I
'm
a
good
feller
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Brooke
reflected
that
it
was
market-day
,
and
that
his
worthy
tenant
*NL*
had
probably
been
dining
,
but
saw
no
reason
why
he
should
not
go
on
,
*NL*
since
he
could
take
the
precaution
of
repeating
what
he
had
to
say
to
*NL*
Mrs.
Dagley
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
little
lad
Jacob
has
been
caught
killing
a
leveret
,
Dagley
:
I
*NL*
have
told
Johnson
to
lock
him
up
in
the
empty
stable
an
hour
or
two
,
*NL*
just
to
frighten
him
,
you
know
.
But
he
will
be
brought
home
by-and-by
,
*NL*
before
night
:
and
you
'll
just
look
after
him
,
will
you
,
and
give
him
a
*NL*
reprimand
,
you
know
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
woo
n't
:
I
'll
be
dee
'd
if
I
'll
leather
my
boy
to
please
you
or
*NL*
anybody
else
,
not
if
you
was
twenty
landlords
istid
o
'
one
,
and
that
a
*NL*
bad
un
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dagley
's
words
were
loud
enough
to
summon
his
wife
to
the
back-kitchen
*NL*
door
--
the
only
entrance
ever
used
,
and
one
always
open
except
in
bad
*NL*
weather
--
and
Mr.
Brooke
,
saying
soothingly
,
``
Well
,
well
,
I
'll
speak
to
*NL*
your
wife
--
I
did
n't
mean
beating
,
you
know
,
''
turned
to
walk
to
the
*NL*
house
.
But
Dagley
,
only
the
more
inclined
to
``
have
his
say
''
with
a
*NL*
gentleman
who
walked
away
from
him
,
followed
at
once
,
with
Fag
*NL*
slouching
at
his
heels
and
sullenly
evading
some
small
and
probably
*NL*
charitable
advances
on
the
part
of
Monk
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
do
,
Mrs.
Dagley
?
''
said
Mr.
Brooke
,
making
some
haste
.
``
I
*NL*
came
to
tell
you
about
your
boy
:
I
do
n't
want
you
to
give
him

stick
,
you
know

''
He
was
careful
to
speak
quite
plainly
this
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
Overworked
Mrs.
Dagley
--
a
thin
,
worn
woman
,
from
whose
life
pleasure
*NL*
had
so
entirely
vanished
that
she
had
not
even
any
Sunday
clothes
which
*NL*
could
give
her
satisfaction
in
preparing
for
church
--
had
already
had
a
*NL*
misunderstanding
with
her
husband
since
he
had
come
home
,
and
was
in
*NL*
low
spirits
,
expecting
the
worst
.
But
her
husband
was
beforehand
in
*NL*
answering
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
nor
he
woo
n't
hev
the
stick
,
whether
you
want
it
or
no
,
''
pursued
*NL*
Dagley
,
throwing
out
his
voice
,
as
if
he
wanted
it
to
hit
hard
.
*NL*
``
You
've
got
no
call
to
come

talk
about

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'd
far
better
hold
your
tongue

said
the
wife
,
``
and
not

been
an

at

the

*NL*
*NL*
``
Niver

more
fiercely
,
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
My
good
fellow
,
you
're
drunk

said
Mr.
Brooke
,
*NL*
confidentially
but
not
judiciously
.
``
Another

another

he
*NL*
added
,
turning
as
if
to
go
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Dagley
immediately
fronted
him
,
and
Fag
at
his
heels
growled
low
,
*NL*
as
his
master
's
voice
grew
louder
and
more
insulting
,
while
Monk
also
*NL*
drew
close
in
silent
dignified
watch
.
The
laborers
on
the
wagon
were
*NL*
pausing
to
listen
,
and
it
seemed
wiser
to
be
quite
passive
than
to
*NL*
attempt
a
ridiculous
flight
pursued
by
a
bawling
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
no
more
drunk
nor
you

nor
so
much

said
Dagley
.
``

That
's
what

I
'n
got

''
concluded
Mr.
Dagley
,
striking
his
fork
into
the
*NL*
ground
with
a
firmness
which
proved
inconvenient
as
he
tried
to
draw
it
*NL*
up
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
last
action
Monk
began
to
bark
loudly
,
and
it
was
a
moment
for
*NL*
Mr.
Brooke
to
escape
.
He
walked
out
of
the
yard
as
quickly
as
he
*NL*
could
,
in
some
amazement
at
the
novelty
of
his
situation
.
He
had
never
*NL*
been
insulted
on
his
own
land
before
,
and
had
been
inclined
to
regard
*NL*
himself
as
a
general
favorite
-LRB-
we
are
all
apt
to
do
so
,
when
we
think
*NL*
of
our
own
amiability
more
than
of
what
other
people
are
likely
to
want
*NL*
of
us
-RRB-
.
When
he
had
quarrelled
with
Caleb
Garth
twelve
years
before
he
*NL*
had
thought
that
the
tenants
would
be
pleased
at
the
landlord
's
taking
*NL*
everything
into
his
own
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
who
follow
the
narrative
of
his
experience
may
wonder
at
the
*NL*
midnight
darkness
of
Mr.
Dagley
;
but
nothing
was
easier
in
those
times
*NL*
than
for
an
hereditary
farmer
of
his
grade
to
be
ignorant
,
in
spite
*NL*
somehow
of
having
a
rector
in
the
twin
parish
who
was
a
gentleman
to
*NL*
the
backbone
,
a
curate
nearer
at
hand
who
preached
more
learnedly
than
*NL*
the
rector
,
a
landlord
who
had
gone
into
everything
,
especially
fine
*NL*
art
and
social
improvement
,
and
all
the
lights
of
Middlemarch
only
*NL*
three
miles
off
.
As
to
the
facility
with
which
mortals
escape
*NL*
knowledge
,
try
an
average
acquaintance
in
the
intellectual
blaze
of
*NL*
London
,
and
consider
what
that
eligible
person
for
a
dinner-party
would
*NL*
have
been
if
he
had
learned
scant
skill
in
``
summing
''
from
the
*NL*
parish-clerk
of
Tipton
,
and
read
a
chapter
in
the
Bible
with
immense
*NL*
difficulty
,
because
such
names
as
Isaiah
or
Apollos
remained
*NL*
unmanageable
after
twice
spelling
.
Poor
Dagley
read
a
few
verses
*NL*
sometimes
on
a
Sunday
evening
,
and
the
world
was
at
least
not
darker
to
*NL*
him
than
it
had
been
before
.
Some
things
he
knew
thoroughly
,
namely
,
*NL*
the
slovenly
habits
of
farming
,
and
the
awkwardness
of
weather
,
stock
*NL*
and
crops
,
at
Freeman
's
End
--
so
called
apparently
by
way
of
sarcasm
,
*NL*
to
imply
that
a
man
was
free
to
quit
it
if
he
chose
,
but
that
there
was
*NL*
no
earthly
``
beyond
''
open
to
him
.

CHAPTER
XL
.
*NL*
*NL*
Wise
in
his
daily
work
was
he
:
*NL*
To
fruits
of
diligence
,
*NL*
And
not
to
faiths
or
polity
,
*NL*
He
plied
his
utmost
sense
.
*NL*
These
perfect
in
their
little
parts
,
*NL*
Whose
work
is
all
their
prize
--
*NL*
Without
them
how
could
laws
,
or
arts
,
*NL*
Or
towered
cities
rise
?
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
In
watching
effects
,
if
only
of
an
electric
battery
,
it
is
often
*NL*
necessary
to
change
our
place
and
examine
a
particular
mixture
or
group
*NL*
at
some
distance
from
the
point
where
the
movement
we
are
interested
in
*NL*
was
set
up
.
The
group
I
am
moving
towards
is
at
Caleb
Garth
's
*NL*
breakfast-table
in
the
large
parlor
where
the
maps
and
desk
were
:
*NL*
father
,
mother
,
and
five
of
the
children
.
Mary
was
just
now
at
home
*NL*
waiting
for
a
situation
,
while
Christy
,
the
boy
next
to
her
,
was
*NL*
getting
cheap
learning
and
cheap
fare
in
Scotland
,
having
to
his
*NL*
father
's
disappointment
taken
to
books
instead
of
that
sacred
calling
*NL*
``
business
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
letters
had
come
--
nine
costly
letters
,
for
which
the
postman
had
*NL*
been
paid
three
and
twopence
,
and
Mr.
Garth
was
forgetting
his
tea
and
*NL*
toast
while
he
read
his
letters
and
laid
them
open
one
above
the
other
,
*NL*
sometimes
swaying
his
head
slowly
,
sometimes
screwing
up
his
mouth
in
*NL*
inward
debate
,
but
not
forgetting
to
cut
off
a
large
red
seal
unbroken
,
*NL*
which
Letty
snatched
up
like
an
eager
terrier
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
talk
among
the
rest
went
on
unrestrainedly
,
for
nothing
disturbed
*NL*
Caleb
's
absorption
except
shaking
the
table
when
he
was
writing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
letters
of
the
nine
had
been
for
Mary
.
After
reading
them
,
she
had
*NL*
passed
them
to
her
mother
,
and
sat
playing
with
her
tea-spoon
absently
,
*NL*
till
with
a
sudden
recollection
she
returned
to
her
sewing
,
which
she
*NL*
had
kept
on
her
lap
during
breakfast
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
do
n't
sew
,
Mary
!
''
said
Ben
,
pulling
her
arm
down
.
``
Make
me
a
*NL*
peacock
with
this
bread-crumb
.
''
He
had
been
kneading
a
small
mass
for
*NL*
the
purpose
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
Mischief
!
''
said
Mary
,
good-humoredly
,
while
she
pricked
his
*NL*
hand
lightly
with
her
needle
.
``
Try
and
mould
it
yourself
:
you
have
*NL*
seen
me
do
it
often
enough
.
I
must
get
this
sewing
done
.
It
is
for
*NL*
Rosamond
Vincy
:
she
is
to
be
married
next
week
,
and
she
ca
n't
be
*NL*
married
without
this
handkerchief
.
''
Mary
ended
merrily
,
amused
with
*NL*
the
last
notion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
ca
n't
she
,
Mary
?
''
said
Letty
,
seriously
interested
in
this
*NL*
mystery
,
and
pushing
her
head
so
close
to
her
sister
that
Mary
now
*NL*
turned
the
threatening
needle
towards
Letty
's
nose
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
this
is
one
of
a
dozen
,
and
without
it
there
would
only
be
*NL*
eleven
,
''
said
Mary
,
with
a
grave
air
of
explanation
,
so
that
Letty
sank
*NL*
back
with
a
sense
of
knowledge
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
made
up
your
mind
,
my
dear
?
''
said
Mrs.
Garth
,
laying
the
*NL*
letters
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
go
to
the
school
at
York
,
''
said
Mary
.
``
I
am
less
unfit
to
*NL*
teach
in
a
school
than
in
a
family
.
I
like
to
teach
classes
best
.
*NL*
And
,
you
see
,
I
must
teach
:
there
is
nothing
else
to
be
done
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Teaching
seems
to
me
the
most
delightful
work
in
the
world
,
''
said
Mrs.
*NL*
Garth
,
with
a
touch
of
rebuke
in
her
tone
.
``
I
could
understand
your
*NL*
objection
to
it
if
you
had
not
knowledge
enough
,
Mary
,
or
if
you
*NL*
disliked
children
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
we
never
quite
understand
why
another
dislikes
what
we
like
,
*NL*
mother
,
''
said
Mary
,
rather
curtly
.
``
I
am
not
fond
of
a
schoolroom
:
I
*NL*
like
the
outside
world
better
.
It
is
a
very
inconvenient
fault
of
*NL*
mine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
must
be
very
stupid
to
be
always
in
a
girls
'
school
,
''
said
Alfred
.
*NL*
``
Such
a
set
of
nincompoops
,
like
Mrs.
Ballard
's
pupils
walking
two
and
*NL*
two
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
they
have
no
games
worth
playing
at
,
''
said
Jim
.
``
They
can
neither
*NL*
throw
nor
leap
.
I
do
n't
wonder
at
Mary
's
not
liking
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
that
Mary
does
n't
like
,
eh
?
''
said
the
father
,
looking
over
his
*NL*
spectacles
and
pausing
before
he
opened
his
next
letter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Being
among
a
lot
of
nincompoop
girls
,
''
said
Alfred
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
the
situation
you
had
heard
of
,
Mary
?
''
said
Caleb
,
gently
,
*NL*
looking
at
his
daughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
father
:
the
school
at
York
.
I
have
determined
to
take
it
.
It
is
*NL*
quite
the
best
.
Thirty-five
pounds
a-year
,
and
extra
pay
for
teaching
*NL*
the
smallest
strummers
at
the
piano
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
child
!
I
wish
she
could
stay
at
home
with
us
,
Susan
,
''
said
*NL*
Caleb
,
looking
plaintively
at
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mary
would
not
be
happy
without
doing
her
duty
,
''
said
Mrs.
Garth
,
*NL*
magisterially
,
conscious
of
having
done
her
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
n't
make
me
happy
to
do
such
a
nasty
duty
as
that
,
''
said
*NL*
Alfred
--
at
which
Mary
and
her
father
laughed
silently
,
but
Mrs.
Garth
*NL*
said
,
gravely
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
find
a
fitter
word
than
nasty
,
my
dear
Alfred
,
for
everything
that
*NL*
you
think
disagreeable
.
And
suppose
that
Mary
could
help
you
to
go
to
*NL*
Mr.
Hanmer
's
with
the
money
she
gets
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
seems
to
me
a
great
shame
.
But
she
's
an
old
brick
,
''
said
Alfred
,
*NL*
rising
from
his
chair
,
and
pulling
Mary
's
head
backward
to
kiss
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
colored
and
laughed
,
but
could
not
conceal
that
the
tears
were
*NL*
coming
.
Caleb
,
looking
on
over
his
spectacles
,
with
the
angles
of
his
*NL*
eyebrows
falling
,
had
an
expression
of
mingled
delight
and
sorrow
as
he
*NL*
returned
to
the
opening
of
his
letter
;
and
even
Mrs.
Garth
,
her
lips
*NL*
curling
with
a
calm
contentment
,
allowed
that
inappropriate
language
to
*NL*
pass
without
correction
,
although
Ben
immediately
took
it
up
,
and
sang
,
*NL*
``
She
's
an
old
brick
,
old
brick
,
old
brick
!
''
to
a
cantering
measure
,
*NL*
which
he
beat
out
with
his
fist
on
Mary
's
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Mrs.
Garth
's
eyes
were
now
drawn
towards
her
husband
,
who
was
*NL*
already
deep
in
the
letter
he
was
reading
.
His
face
had
an
expression
*NL*
of
grave
surprise
,
which
alarmed
her
a
little
,
but
he
did
not
like
to
*NL*
be
questioned
while
he
was
reading
,
and
she
remained
anxiously
watching
*NL*
till
she
saw
him
suddenly
shaken
by
a
little
joyous
laugh
as
he
turned
*NL*
back
to
the
beginning
of
the
letter
,
and
looking
at
her
above
his
*NL*
spectacles
,
said
,
in
a
low
tone
,
``
What
do
you
think
,
Susan
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
went
and
stood
behind
him
,
putting
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
,
while
*NL*
they
read
the
letter
together
.
It
was
from
Sir
James
Chettam
,
offering
*NL*
to
Mr.
Garth
the
management
of
the
family
estates
at
Freshitt
and
*NL*
elsewhere
,
and
adding
that
Sir
James
had
been
requested
by
Mr.
Brooke
*NL*
of
Tipton
to
ascertain
whether
Mr.
Garth
would
be
disposed
at
the
same
*NL*
time
to
resume
the
agency
of
the
Tipton
property
.
The
Baronet
added
in
*NL*
very
obliging
words
that
he
himself
was
particularly
desirous
of
seeing
*NL*
the
Freshitt
and
Tipton
estates
under
the
same
management
,
and
he
hoped
*NL*
to
be
able
to
show
that
the
double
agency
might
be
held
on
terms
*NL*
agreeable
to
Mr.
Garth
,
whom
he
would
be
glad
to
see
at
the
Hall
at
*NL*
twelve
o'clock
on
the
following
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
writes
handsomely
,
does
n't
he
,
Susan
?
''
said
Caleb
,
turning
his
eyes
*NL*
upward
to
his
wife
,
who
raised
her
hand
from
his
shoulder
to
his
ear
,
*NL*
while
she
rested
her
chin
on
his
head
.
``
Brooke
did
n't
like
to
ask
me
*NL*
himself
,
I
can
see
,
''
he
continued
,
laughing
silently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
is
an
honor
to
your
father
,
children
,
''
said
Mrs.
Garth
,
looking
*NL*
round
at
the
five
pair
of
eyes
,
all
fixed
on
the
parents
.
``
He
is
asked
*NL*
to
take
a
post
again
by
those
who
dismissed
him
long
ago
.
That
shows
*NL*
that
he
did
his
work
well
,
so
that
they
feel
the
want
of
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Like
Cincinnatus
--
hooray
!
''
said
Ben
,
riding
on
his
chair
,
with
a
*NL*
pleasant
confidence
that
discipline
was
relaxed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
they
come
to
fetch
him
,
mother
?
''
said
Letty
,
thinking
of
the
*NL*
Mayor
and
Corporation
in
their
robes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Garth
patted
Letty
's
head
and
smiled
,
but
seeing
that
her
husband
*NL*
was
gathering
up
his
letters
and
likely
soon
to
be
out
of
reach
in
that
*NL*
sanctuary
``
business
,
''
she
pressed
his
shoulder
and
said
emphatically
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
mind
you
ask
fair
pay
,
Caleb
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
,
''
said
Caleb
,
in
a
deep
voice
of
assent
,
as
if
it
would
be
*NL*
unreasonable
to
suppose
anything
else
of
him
.
``
It
'll
come
to
between
*NL*
four
and
five
hundred
,
the
two
together
.
''
Then
with
a
little
start
of
*NL*
remembrance
he
said
,
``
Mary
,
write
and
give
up
that
school
.
Stay
and
*NL*
help
your
mother
.
I
'm
as
pleased
as
Punch
,
now
I
've
thought
of
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
No
manner
could
have
been
less
like
that
of
Punch
triumphant
than
*NL*
Caleb
's
,
but
his
talents
did
not
lie
in
finding
phrases
,
though
he
was
*NL*
very
particular
about
his
letter-writing
,
and
regarded
his
wife
as
a
*NL*
treasury
of
correct
language
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
almost
an
uproar
among
the
children
now
,
and
Mary
held
up
the
*NL*
cambric
embroidery
towards
her
mother
entreatingly
,
that
it
might
be
*NL*
put
out
of
reach
while
the
boys
dragged
her
into
a
dance
.
Mrs.
Garth
,
*NL*
in
placid
joy
,
began
to
put
the
cups
and
plates
together
,
while
Caleb
*NL*
pushing
his
chair
from
the
table
,
as
if
he
were
going
to
move
to
the
*NL*
desk
,
still
sat
holding
his
letters
in
his
hand
and
looking
on
the
*NL*
ground
meditatively
,
stretching
out
the
fingers
of
his
left
hand
,
*NL*
according
to
a
mute
language
of
his
own
.
At
last
he
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
thousand
pities
Christy
did
n't
take
to
business
,
Susan
.
I
*NL*
shall
want
help
by-and-by
.
And
Alfred
must
go
off
to
the
*NL*
engineering
--
I
've
made
up
my
mind
to
that
.
''
He
fell
into
meditation
and
*NL*
finger-rhetoric
again
for
a
little
while
,
and
then
continued
:
``
I
shall
*NL*
make
Brooke
have
new
agreements
with
the
tenants
,
and
I
shall
draw
up
a
*NL*
rotation
of
crops
.
And
I
'll
lay
a
wager
we
can
get
fine
bricks
out
of
*NL*
the
clay
at
Bott
's
corner
.
I
must
look
into
that
:
it
would
cheapen
the
*NL*
repairs
.
It
's
a
fine
bit
of
work
,
Susan
!
A
man
without
a
family
would
*NL*
be
glad
to
do
it
for
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mind
you
do
n't
,
though
,
''
said
his
wife
,
lifting
up
her
finger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
;
but
it
's
a
fine
thing
to
come
to
a
man
when
he
's
seen
into
the
*NL*
nature
of
business
:
to
have
the
chance
of
getting
a
bit
of
the
country
*NL*
into
good
fettle
,
as
they
say
,
and
putting
men
into
the
right
way
with
*NL*
their
farming
,
and
getting
a
bit
of
good
contriving
and
solid
building
*NL*
done
--
that
those
who
are
living
and
those
who
come
after
will
be
the
*NL*
better
for
.
I
'd
sooner
have
it
than
a
fortune
.
I
hold
it
the
most
*NL*
honorable
work
that
is
.
''
Here
Caleb
laid
down
his
letters
,
thrust
his
*NL*
fingers
between
the
buttons
of
his
waistcoat
,
and
sat
upright
,
but
*NL*
presently
proceeded
with
some
awe
in
his
voice
and
moving
his
head
*NL*
slowly
aside
--
``
It
's
a
great
gift
of
God
,
Susan
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
it
is
,
Caleb
,
''
said
his
wife
,
with
answering
fervor
.
``
And
it
*NL*
will
be
a
blessing
to
your
children
to
have
had
a
father
who
did
such
*NL*
work
:
a
father
whose
good
work
remains
though
his
name
may
be
*NL*
forgotten
.
''
She
could
not
say
any
more
to
him
then
about
the
pay
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
evening
,
when
Caleb
,
rather
tired
with
his
day
's
work
,
was
*NL*
seated
in
silence
with
his
pocket-book
open
on
his
knee
,
while
Mrs.
*NL*
Garth
and
Mary
were
at
their
sewing
,
and
Letty
in
a
corner
was
*NL*
whispering
a
dialogue
with
her
doll
,
Mr.
Farebrother
came
up
the
*NL*
orchard
walk
,
dividing
the
bright
August
lights
and
shadows
with
the
*NL*
tufted
grass
and
the
apple-tree
boughs
.
We
know
that
he
was
fond
of
*NL*
his
parishioners
the
Garths
,
and
had
thought
Mary
worth
mentioning
to
*NL*
Lydgate
.
He
used
to
the
full
the
clergyman
's
privilege
of
disregarding
*NL*
the
Middlemarch
discrimination
of
ranks
,
and
always
told
his
mother
*NL*
that
Mrs.
Garth
was
more
of
a
lady
than
any
matron
in
the
town
.
Still
,
*NL*
you
see
,
he
spent
his
evenings
at
the
Vincys
'
,
where
the
matron
,
though
*NL*
less
of
a
lady
,
presided
over
a
well-lit
drawing-room
and
whist
.
In
*NL*
those
days
human
intercourse
was
not
determined
solely
by
respect
.
But
*NL*
the
Vicar
did
heartily
respect
the
Garths
,
and
a
visit
from
him
was
no
*NL*
surprise
to
that
family
.
Nevertheless
he
accounted
for
it
even
while
*NL*
he
was
shaking
hands
,
by
saying
,
``
I
come
as
an
envoy
,
Mrs.
Garth
:
I
*NL*
have
something
to
say
to
you
and
Garth
on
behalf
of
Fred
Vincy
.
The
*NL*
fact
is
,
poor
fellow
,
''
he
continued
,
as
he
seated
himself
and
looked
*NL*
round
with
his
bright
glance
at
the
three
who
were
listening
to
him
,
*NL*
``
he
has
taken
me
into
his
confidence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
's
heart
beat
rather
quickly
:
she
wondered
how
far
Fred
's
*NL*
confidence
had
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
n't
seen
the
lad
for
months
,
''
said
Caleb
.
``
I
could
n't
think
*NL*
what
was
become
of
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
been
away
on
a
visit
,
''
said
the
Vicar
,
``
because
home
was
a
*NL*
little
too
hot
for
him
,
and
Lydgate
told
his
mother
that
the
poor
*NL*
fellow
must
not
begin
to
study
yet
.
But
yesterday
he
came
and
poured
*NL*
himself
out
to
me
.
I
am
very
glad
he
did
,
because
I
have
seen
him
grow
*NL*
up
from
a
youngster
of
fourteen
,
and
I
am
so
much
at
home
in
the
house
*NL*
that
the
children
are
like
nephews
and
nieces
to
me
.
But
it
is
a
*NL*
difficult
case
to
advise
upon
.
However
,
he
has
asked
me
to
come
and
*NL*
tell
you
that
he
is
going
away
,
and
that
he
is
so
miserable
about
his
*NL*
debt
to
you
,
and
his
inability
to
pay
,
that
he
ca
n't
bear
to
come
*NL*
himself
even
to
bid
you
good
by
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
him
it
does
n't
signify
a
farthing
,
''
said
Caleb
,
waving
his
hand
.
*NL*
``
We
've
had
the
pinch
and
have
got
over
it
.
And
now
I
'm
going
to
be
as
*NL*
rich
as
a
Jew
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Which
means
,
''
said
Mrs.
Garth
,
smiling
at
the
Vicar
,
``
that
we
are
*NL*
going
to
have
enough
to
bring
up
the
boys
well
and
to
keep
Mary
at
*NL*
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
treasure-trove
?
''
said
Mr.
Farebrother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
going
to
be
agent
for
two
estates
,
Freshitt
and
Tipton
;
and
*NL*
perhaps
for
a
pretty
little
bit
of
land
in
Lowick
besides
:
it
's
all
the
*NL*
same
family
connection
,
and
employment
spreads
like
water
if
it
's
once
*NL*
set
going
.
It
makes
me
very
happy
,
Mr.
Farebrother
''
--
here
Caleb
threw
*NL*
back
his
head
a
little
,
and
spread
his
arms
on
the
elbows
of
his
*NL*
chair
--
``
that
I
've
got
an
opportunity
again
with
the
letting
of
the
*NL*
land
,
and
carrying
out
a
notion
or
two
with
improvements
.
It
's
a
most
*NL*
uncommonly
cramping
thing
,
as
I
've
often
told
Susan
,
to
sit
on
*NL*
horseback
and
look
over
the
hedges
at
the
wrong
thing
,
and
not
be
able
*NL*
to
put
your
hand
to
it
to
make
it
right
.
What
people
do
who
go
into
*NL*
politics
I
ca
n't
think
:
it
drives
me
almost
mad
to
see
mismanagement
*NL*
over
only
a
few
hundred
acres
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
seldom
that
Caleb
volunteered
so
long
a
speech
,
but
his
*NL*
happiness
had
the
effect
of
mountain
air
:
his
eyes
were
bright
,
and
the
*NL*
words
came
without
effort
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
congratulate
you
heartily
,
Garth
,
''
said
the
Vicar
.
``
This
is
the
*NL*
best
sort
of
news
I
could
have
had
to
carry
to
Fred
Vincy
,
for
he
dwelt
*NL*
a
good
deal
on
the
injury
he
had
done
you
in
causing
you
to
part
with
*NL*
money
--
robbing
you
of
it
,
he
said
--
which
you
wanted
for
other
purposes
.
*NL*
I
wish
Fred
were
not
such
an
idle
dog
;
he
has
some
very
good
points
,
*NL*
and
his
father
is
a
little
hard
upon
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
is
he
going
?
''
said
Mrs.
Garth
,
rather
coldly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
means
to
try
again
for
his
degree
,
and
he
is
going
up
to
study
*NL*
before
term
.
I
have
advised
him
to
do
that
.
I
do
n't
urge
him
to
enter
*NL*
the
Church
--
on
the
contrary
.
But
if
he
will
go
and
work
so
as
to
pass
,
*NL*
that
will
be
some
guarantee
that
he
has
energy
and
a
will
;
and
he
is
*NL*
quite
at
sea
;
he
does
n't
know
what
else
to
do
.
So
far
he
will
please
*NL*
his
father
,
and
I
have
promised
in
the
mean
time
to
try
and
reconcile
*NL*
Vincy
to
his
son
's
adopting
some
other
line
of
life
.
Fred
says
frankly
*NL*
he
is
not
fit
for
a
clergyman
,
and
I
would
do
anything
I
could
to
*NL*
hinder
a
man
from
the
fatal
step
of
choosing
the
wrong
profession
.
He
*NL*
quoted
to
me
what
you
said
,
Miss
Garth
--
do
you
remember
it
?
''
-LRB-
Mr.
*NL*
Farebrother
used
to
say
``
Mary
''
instead
of
``
Miss
Garth
,
''
but
it
was
part
*NL*
of
his
delicacy
to
treat
her
with
the
more
deference
because
,
according
*NL*
to
Mrs.
Vincy
's
phrase
,
she
worked
for
her
bread
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
felt
uncomfortable
,
but
,
determined
to
take
the
matter
lightly
,
*NL*
answered
at
once
,
``
I
have
said
so
many
impertinent
things
to
Fred
--
we
*NL*
are
such
old
playfellows
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
said
,
according
to
him
,
that
he
would
be
one
of
those
ridiculous
*NL*
clergymen
who
help
to
make
the
whole
clergy
ridiculous
.
Really
,
that
*NL*
was
so
cutting
that
I
felt
a
little
cut
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Caleb
laughed
.
``
She
gets
her
tongue
from
you
,
Susan
,
''
he
said
,
with
*NL*
some
enjoyment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
its
flippancy
,
father
,
''
said
Mary
,
quickly
,
fearing
that
her
*NL*
mother
would
be
displeased
.
``
It
is
rather
too
bad
of
Fred
to
repeat
my
*NL*
flippant
speeches
to
Mr.
Farebrother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
certainly
a
hasty
speech
,
my
dear
,
''
said
Mrs.
Garth
,
with
whom
*NL*
speaking
evil
of
dignities
was
a
high
misdemeanor
.
``
We
should
not
*NL*
value
our
Vicar
the
less
because
there
was
a
ridiculous
curate
in
the
*NL*
next
parish
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
something
in
what
she
says
,
though
,
''
said
Caleb
,
not
disposed
*NL*
to
have
Mary
's
sharpness
undervalued
.
``
A
bad
workman
of
any
sort
makes
*NL*
his
fellows
mistrusted
.
Things
hang
together
,
''
he
added
,
looking
on
*NL*
the
floor
and
moving
his
feet
uneasily
with
a
sense
that
words
were
*NL*
scantier
than
thoughts
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Clearly
,
''
said
the
Vicar
,
amused
.
``
By
being
contemptible
we
set
men
's
*NL*
minds
,
to
the
tune
of
contempt
.
I
certainly
agree
with
Miss
Garth
's
*NL*
view
of
the
matter
,
whether
I
am
condemned
by
it
or
not
.
But
as
to
*NL*
Fred
Vincy
,
it
is
only
fair
he
should
be
excused
a
little
:
old
*NL*
Featherstone
's
delusive
behavior
did
help
to
spoil
him
.
There
was
*NL*
something
quite
diabolical
in
not
leaving
him
a
farthing
after
all
.
*NL*
But
Fred
has
the
good
taste
not
to
dwell
on
that
.
And
what
he
cares
*NL*
most
about
is
having
offended
you
,
Mrs.
Garth
;
he
supposes
you
will
*NL*
never
think
well
of
him
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
been
disappointed
in
Fred
,
''
said
Mrs.
Garth
,
with
decision
.
*NL*
``
But
I
shall
be
ready
to
think
well
of
him
again
when
he
gives
me
good
*NL*
reason
to
do
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
point
Mary
went
out
of
the
room
,
taking
Letty
with
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
we
must
forgive
young
people
when
they
're
sorry
,
''
said
Caleb
,
*NL*
watching
Mary
close
the
door
.
``
And
as
you
say
,
Mr.
Farebrother
,
there
*NL*
was
the
very
devil
in
that
old
man
.
Now
Mary
's
gone
out
,
I
must
tell
you
*NL*
a
thing
--
it
's
only
known
to
Susan
and
me
,
and
you
'll
not
tell
it
again
.
*NL*
The
old
scoundrel
wanted
Mary
to
burn
one
of
the
wills
the
very
night
*NL*
he
died
,
when
she
was
sitting
up
with
him
by
herself
,
and
he
offered
her
*NL*
a
sum
of
money
that
he
had
in
the
box
by
him
if
she
would
do
it
.
But
Mary
,
*NL*
you
understand
,
could
do
no
such
thing
--
would
not
be
handling
his
iron
*NL*
chest
,
and
so
on
.
Now
,
you
see
,
the
will
he
wanted
burnt
was
this
last
,
*NL*
so
that
if
Mary
had
done
what
he
wanted
,
Fred
Vincy
would
have
had
ten
*NL*
thousand
pounds
.
The
old
man
did
turn
to
him
at
the
last
.
That
touches
*NL*
poor
Mary
close
;
she
could
n't
help
it
--
she
was
in
the
right
to
do
what
*NL*
she
did
,
but
she
feels
,
as
she
says
,
much
as
if
she
had
knocked
down
*NL*
somebody
's
property
and
broken
it
against
her
will
,
when
she
was
*NL*
rightfully
defending
herself
.
I
feel
with
her
,
somehow
,
and
if
I
could
*NL*
make
any
amends
to
the
poor
lad
,
instead
of
bearing
him
a
grudge
for
*NL*
the
harm
he
did
us
,
I
should
be
glad
to
do
it
.
Now
,
what
is
your
opinion
,
*NL*
sir
?
Susan
does
n't
agree
with
me
.
She
says
--
tell
what
you
say
,
Susan
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mary
could
not
have
acted
otherwise
,
even
if
she
had
known
what
would
*NL*
be
the
effect
on
Fred

''
said
Mrs.
Garth
,
pausing
from
her
work
,
and
*NL*
looking
at
Mr.
Farebrother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
she
was
quite
ignorant
of
it
.
It
seems
to
me
,
a
loss
which
falls
*NL*
on
another
because
we
have
done
right
is
not
to
lie
upon
our
*NL*
conscience
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Vicar
did
not
answer
immediately
,
and
Caleb
said
,
``
It
's
the
*NL*
feeling

The
child
feels
in
that
way
,
and
I
feel
with
her

do
n't
*NL*
mean
your
horse
to
tread
on
a
dog
when
you
're
backing
out
of
the
way

it
goes
through
you

when
it
's
done

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sure
Mrs.
Garth
would
agree
with
you
there
,
''
said
Mr.
*NL*
Farebrother
,
who
for
some
reason
seemed
more
inclined
to
ruminate
than
*NL*
to
speak
.
``
One
could
hardly
say
that
the
feeling
you
mention
about
*NL*
Fred
is
wrong
--
or
rather
,
mistaken

though
no
man
ought
to
make
a
claim
*NL*
on
such
feeling
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

well

said
Caleb
,
``
it
's
a
secret

You
will
not
tell
Fred
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
not
.
But
I
shall
carry
the
other
good
news
--
that
you
can
*NL*
afford
the
loss
he
caused
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Farebrother
left
the
house
soon
after
,
and
seeing
Mary
in
the
*NL*
orchard
with
Letty
,
went
to
say
good-by
to
her
.
They
made
a
pretty
*NL*
picture
in
the
western
light
which
brought
out
the
brightness
of
the
*NL*
apples
on
the
old
scant-leaved
boughs
--
Mary
in
her
lavender
gingham
and
*NL*
black
ribbons
holding
a
basket
,
while
Letty
in
her
well-worn
nankin
*NL*
picked
up
the
fallen
apples
.
If
you
want
to
know
more
particularly
how
*NL*
Mary
looked
,
ten
to
one
you
will
see
a
face
like
hers
in
the
crowded
*NL*
street
to-morrow
,
if
you
are
there
on
the
watch
:
she
will
not
be
among
*NL*
those
daughters
of
Zion
who
are
haughty
,
and
walk
with
stretched-out
*NL*
necks
and
wanton
eyes
,
mincing
as
they
go
:
let
all
those
pass
,
and
fix
*NL*
your
eyes
on
some
small
plump
brownish
person
of
firm
but
quiet
*NL*
carriage
,
who
looks
about
her
,
but
does
not
suppose
that
anybody
is
*NL*
looking
at
her
.
If
she
has
a
broad
face
and
square
brow
,
well-marked
*NL*
eyebrows
and
curly
dark
hair
,
a
certain
expression
of
amusement
in
her
*NL*
glance
which
her
mouth
keeps
the
secret
of
,
and
for
the
rest
features
*NL*
entirely
insignificant
--
take
that
ordinary
but
not
disagreeable
person
*NL*
for
a
portrait
of
Mary
Garth
.
If
you
made
her
smile
,
she
would
show
*NL*
you
perfect
little
teeth
;
if
you
made
her
angry
,
she
would
not
raise
*NL*
her
voice
,
but
would
probably
say
one
of
the
bitterest
things
you
have
*NL*
ever
tasted
the
flavor
of
;
if
you
did
her
a
kindness
,
she
would
never
*NL*
forget
it
.
Mary
admired
the
keen-faced
handsome
little
Vicar
in
his
*NL*
well-brushed
threadbare
clothes
more
than
any
man
she
had
had
the
*NL*
opportunity
of
knowing
.
She
had
never
heard
him
say
a
foolish
thing
,
*NL*
though
she
knew
that
he
did
unwise
ones
;
and
perhaps
foolish
sayings
*NL*
were
more
objectionable
to
her
than
any
of
Mr.
Farebrother
's
unwise
*NL*
doings
.
At
least
,
it
was
remarkable
that
the
actual
imperfections
of
*NL*
the
Vicar
's
clerical
character
never
seemed
to
call
forth
the
same
*NL*
scorn
and
dislike
which
she
showed
beforehand
for
the
predicted
*NL*
imperfections
of
the
clerical
character
sustained
by
Fred
Vincy
.
These
*NL*
irregularities
of
judgment
,
I
imagine
,
are
found
even
in
riper
minds
*NL*
than
Mary
Garth
's
:
our
impartiality
is
kept
for
abstract
merit
and
*NL*
demerit
,
which
none
of
us
ever
saw
.
Will
any
one
guess
towards
which
*NL*
of
those
widely
different
men
Mary
had
the
peculiar
woman
's
*NL*
tenderness
?
--
the
one
she
was
most
inclined
to
be
severe
on
,
or
the
*NL*
contrary
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
any
message
for
your
old
playfellow
,
Miss
Garth
?
''
said
the
*NL*
Vicar
,
as
he
took
a
fragrant
apple
from
the
basket
which
she
held
*NL*
towards
him
,
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
.
``
Something
to
soften
down
that
*NL*
harsh
judgment
?
I
am
going
straight
to
see
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Mary
,
shaking
her
head
,
and
smiling
.
``
If
I
were
to
say
that
*NL*
he
would
not
be
ridiculous
as
a
clergyman
,
I
must
say
that
he
would
be
*NL*
something
worse
than
ridiculous
.
But
I
am
very
glad
to
hear
that
he
is
*NL*
going
away
to
work
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
other
hand
,
I
am
very
glad
to
hear
that
_
you
_
are
not
going
*NL*
away
to
work
.
My
mother
,
I
am
sure
,
will
be
all
the
happier
if
you
*NL*
will
come
to
see
her
at
the
vicarage
:
you
know
she
is
fond
of
having
*NL*
young
people
to
talk
to
,
and
she
has
a
great
deal
to
tell
about
old
*NL*
times
.
You
will
really
be
doing
a
kindness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
like
it
very
much
,
if
I
may
,
''
said
Mary
.
``
Everything
seems
*NL*
too
happy
for
me
all
at
once
.
I
thought
it
would
always
be
part
of
my
*NL*
life
to
long
for
home
,
and
losing
that
grievance
makes
me
feel
rather
*NL*
empty
:
I
suppose
it
served
instead
of
sense
to
fill
up
my
mind
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
I
go
with
you
,
Mary
?
''
whispered
Letty
--
a
most
inconvenient
child
,
*NL*
who
listened
to
everything
.
But
she
was
made
exultant
by
having
her
*NL*
chin
pinched
and
her
cheek
kissed
by
Mr.
Farebrother
--
an
incident
*NL*
which
she
narrated
to
her
mother
and
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
Vicar
walked
to
Lowick
,
any
one
watching
him
closely
might
have
*NL*
seen
him
twice
shrug
his
shoulders
.
I
think
that
the
rare
Englishmen
*NL*
who
have
this
gesture
are
never
of
the
heavy
type
--
for
fear
of
any
*NL*
lumbering
instance
to
the
contrary
,
I
will
say
,
hardly
ever
;
they
have
*NL*
usually
a
fine
temperament
and
much
tolerance
towards
the
smaller
*NL*
errors
of
men
-LRB-
themselves
inclusive
-RRB-
.
The
Vicar
was
holding
an
inward
*NL*
dialogue
in
which
he
told
himself
that
there
was
probably
something
*NL*
more
between
Fred
and
Mary
Garth
than
the
regard
of
old
playfellows
,
*NL*
and
replied
with
a
question
whether
that
bit
of
womanhood
were
not
a
*NL*
great
deal
too
choice
for
that
crude
young
gentleman
.
The
rejoinder
to
*NL*
this
was
the
first
shrug
.
Then
he
laughed
at
himself
for
being
likely
*NL*
to
have
felt
jealous
,
as
if
he
had
been
a
man
able
to
marry
,
which
,
*NL*
added
he
,
it
is
as
clear
as
any
balance-sheet
that
I
am
not
.
Whereupon
*NL*
followed
the
second
shrug
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
could
two
men
,
so
different
from
each
other
,
see
in
this
``
brown
*NL*
patch
,
''
as
Mary
called
herself
?
It
was
certainly
not
her
plainness
*NL*
that
attracted
them
-LRB-
and
let
all
plain
young
ladies
be
warned
against
*NL*
the
dangerous
encouragement
given
them
by
Society
to
confide
in
their
*NL*
want
of
beauty
-RRB-
.
A
human
being
in
this
aged
nation
of
ours
is
a
very
*NL*
wonderful
whole
,
the
slow
creation
of
long
interchanging
influences
:
*NL*
and
charm
is
a
result
of
two
such
wholes
,
the
one
loving
and
the
one
*NL*
loved
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Garth
were
sitting
alone
,
Caleb
said
,
``

*NL*
*NL*
``

Caleb

gravely
;

the
nature

it
might

the
making

hardly
anything

more

Mrs.

,
decidedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
care

about

said
Caleb
,
with
a
sturdiness
*NL*
which
he
was
apt
to
show
when
he
had
an
opinion
.
``
The
lad
is
of
age

must
get
his
bread

He
has

enough

he

it

my
belief

well

*NL*
``
But
would

has
the

sort
of
feeling
himself

all

And
if

proposal
came
from
you

putting

moving

down

*NL*
taking
a
pinch
of
snuff
and
holding
it
up
between
his

as

was
fond

he
usually
forgot
that
this
indulgence
was
at

looked
attentive

left
it

in

he
caught

it
were

snatches

The

having

forward

between
Mr.

Mr.
Joshua
Rigg
Featherstone
concerning
the

land
attached
to
Stone
Court

had
occasioned
the
interchange
of
a
*NL*
letter
or
two
between
these
personages
.
*NL*
*NL*
Who
shall
tell
what
may
be
the
effect
of
writing
?
If
it
happens
to
*NL*
have
been
cut
in
stone
,
though
it
lie
face
down-most
for
ages
on
a
*NL*
forsaken
beach
,
or
``
rest
quietly
under
the
drums
and
tramplings
of
many
*NL*
conquests
,
''
it
may
end
by
letting
us
into
the
secret
of
usurpations
and
*NL*
other
scandals
gossiped
about
long
empires
ago
:
--
this
world
being
*NL*
apparently
a
huge
whispering-gallery
.
Such
conditions
are
often
*NL*
minutely
represented
in
our
petty
lifetimes
.
As
the
stone
which
has
*NL*
been
kicked
by
generations
of
clowns
may
come
by
curious
little
links
*NL*
of
effect
under
the
eyes
of
a
scholar
,
through
whose
labors
it
may
at
*NL*
last
fix
the
date
of
invasions
and
unlock
religions
,
so
a
bit
of
ink
*NL*
and
paper
which
has
long
been
an
innocent
wrapping
or
stop-gap
may
at
*NL*
last
be
laid
open
under
the
one
pair
of
eyes
which
have
knowledge
*NL*
enough
to
turn
it
into
the
opening
of
a
catastrophe
.
To
Uriel
watching
*NL*
the
progress
of
planetary
history
from
the
sun
,
the
one
result
would
be
*NL*
just
as
much
of
a
coincidence
as
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
made
this
rather
lofty
comparison
I
am
less
uneasy
in
calling
*NL*
attention
to
the
existence
of
low
people
by
whose
interference
,
however
*NL*
little
we
may
like
it
,
the
course
of
the
world
is
very
much
determined
.
*NL*
It
would
be
well
,
certainly
,
if
we
could
help
to
reduce
their
number
,
*NL*
and
something
might
perhaps
be
done
by
not
lightly
giving
occasion
to
*NL*
their
existence
.
Socially
speaking
,
Joshua
Rigg
would
have
been
*NL*
generally
pronounced
a
superfluity
.
But
those
who
like
Peter
*NL*
Featherstone
never
had
a
copy
of
themselves
demanded
,
are
the
very
last
*NL*
to
wait
for
such
a
request
either
in
prose
or
verse
.
The
copy
in
this
*NL*
case
bore
more
of
outside
resemblance
to
the
mother
,
in
whose
sex
*NL*
frog-features
,
accompanied
with
fresh-colored
cheeks
and
a
well-rounded
*NL*
figure
,
are
compatible
with
much
charm
for
a
certain
order
of
admirers
.
*NL*
The
result
is
sometimes
a
frog-faced
male
,
desirable
,
surely
,
to
no
*NL*
order
of
intelligent
beings
.
Especially
when
he
is
suddenly
brought
*NL*
into
evidence
to
frustrate
other
people
's
expectations
--
the
very
*NL*
lowest
aspect
in
which
a
social
superfluity
can
present
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Mr.
Rigg
Featherstone
's
low
characteristics
were
all
of
the
sober
,
*NL*
water-drinking
kind
.
From
the
earliest
to
the
latest
hour
of
the
day
*NL*
he
was
always
as
sleek
,
neat
,
and
cool
as
the
frog
he
resembled
,
and
*NL*
old
Peter
had
secretly
chuckled
over
an
offshoot
almost
more
*NL*
calculating
,
and
far
more
imperturbable
,
than
himself
.
I
will
add
that
*NL*
his
finger-nails
were
scrupulously
attended
to
,
and
that
he
meant
to
*NL*
marry
a
well-educated
young
lady
-LRB-
as
yet
unspecified
-RRB-
whose
person
was
*NL*
good
,
and
whose
connections
,
in
a
solid
middle-class
way
,
were
*NL*
undeniable
.
Thus
his
nails
and
modesty
were
comparable
to
those
of
*NL*
most
gentlemen
;
though
his
ambition
had
been
educated
only
by
the
*NL*
opportunities
of
a
clerk
and
accountant
in
the
smaller
commercial
*NL*
houses
of
a
seaport
.
He
thought
the
rural
Featherstones
very
simple
*NL*
absurd
people
,
and
they
in
their
turn
regarded
his
``
bringing
up
''
in
a
*NL*
seaport
town
as
an
exaggeration
of
the
monstrosity
that
their
brother
*NL*
Peter
,
and
still
more
Peter
's
property
,
should
have
had
such
belongings
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
garden
and
gravel
approach
,
as
seen
from
the
two
windows
of
the
*NL*
wainscoted
parlor
at
Stone
Court
,
were
never
in
better
trim
than
now
,
*NL*
when
Mr.
Rigg
Featherstone
stood
,
with
his
hands
behind
him
,
looking
*NL*
out
on
these
grounds
as
their
master
.
But
it
seemed
doubtful
whether
*NL*
he
looked
out
for
the
sake
of
contemplation
or
of
turning
his
back
to
a
*NL*
person
who
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
,
with
his
legs
considerably
*NL*
apart
and
his
hands
in
his
trouser-pockets
:
a
person
in
all
respects
a
*NL*
contrast
to
the
sleek
and
cool
Rigg
.
He
was
a
man
obviously
on
the
way
*NL*
towards
sixty
,
very
florid
and
hairy
,
with
much
gray
in
his
bushy
*NL*
whiskers
and
thick
curly
hair
,
a
stoutish
body
which
showed
to
*NL*
disadvantage
the
somewhat
worn
joinings
of
his
clothes
,
and
the
air
of
*NL*
a
swaggerer
,
who
would
aim
at
being
noticeable
even
at
a
show
of
*NL*
fireworks
,
regarding
his
own
remarks
on
any
other
person
's
performance
*NL*
as
likely
to
be
more
interesting
than
the
performance
itself
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
name
was
John
Raffles
,
and
he
sometimes
wrote
jocosely
W.A.G.
*NL*
after
his
signature
,
observing
when
he
did
so
,
that
he
was
once
taught
*NL*
by
Leonard
Lamb
of
Finsbury
who
wrote
B.A.
after
his
name
,
and
that
he
,
*NL*
Raffles
,
originated
the
witticism
of
calling
that
celebrated
principal
*NL*
Ba-Lamb
.
Such
were
the
appearance
and
mental
flavor
of
Mr.
Raffles
,
*NL*
both
of
which
seemed
to
have
a
stale
odor
of
travellers
'
rooms
in
the
*NL*
commercial
hotels
of
that
period
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
now
,
Josh
,
''
he
was
saying
,
in
a
full
rumbling
tone
,
``
look
at
it
*NL*
in
this
light
:
here
is
your
poor
mother
going
into
the
vale
of
years
,
*NL*
and
you
could
afford
something
handsome
now
to
make
her
comfortable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
while
you
live
.
Nothing
would
make
her
comfortable
while
you
*NL*
live
,
''
returned
Rigg
,
in
his
cool
high
voice
.
``
What
I
give
her
,
you
'll
*NL*
take
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
bear
me
a
grudge
,
Josh
,
that
I
know
.
But
come
,
now
--
as
between
*NL*
man
and
man
--
without
humbug
--
a
little
capital
might
enable
me
to
make
a
*NL*
first-rate
thing
of
the
shop
.
The
tobacco
trade
is
growing
.
I
should
*NL*
cut
my
own
nose
off
in
not
doing
the
best
I
could
at
it
.
I
should
*NL*
stick
to
it
like
a
flea
to
a
fleece
for
my
own
sake
.
I
should
always
*NL*
be
on
the
spot
.
And
nothing
would
make
your
poor
mother
so
happy
.
*NL*
I
've
pretty
well
done
with
my
wild
oats
--
turned
fifty-five
.
I
want
to
*NL*
settle
down
in
my
chimney-corner
.
And
if
I
once
buckled
to
the
tobacco
*NL*
trade
,
I
could
bring
an
amount
of
brains
and
experience
to
bear
on
it
*NL*
that
would
not
be
found
elsewhere
in
a
hurry
.
I
do
n't
want
to
be
*NL*
bothering
you
one
time
after
another
,
but
to
get
things
once
for
all
*NL*
into
the
right
channel
.
Consider
that
,
Josh
--
as
between
man
and
*NL*
man
--
and
with
your
poor
mother
to
be
made
easy
for
her
life
.
I
was
*NL*
always
fond
of
the
old
woman
,
by
Jove
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
done
?
''
said
Mr.
Rigg
,
quietly
,
without
looking
away
from
the
*NL*
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
've
done
,
''
said
Raffles
,
taking
hold
of
his
hat
which
stood
*NL*
before
him
on
the
table
,
and
giving
it
a
sort
of
oratorical
push
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
just
listen
to
me
.
The
more
you
say
anything
,
the
less
I
shall
*NL*
believe
it
.
The
more
you
want
me
to
do
a
thing
,
the
more
reason
I
*NL*
shall
have
for
never
doing
it
.
Do
you
think
I
mean
to
forget
your
*NL*
kicking
me
when
I
was
a
lad
,
and
eating
all
the
best
victual
away
from
*NL*
me
and
my
mother
?
Do
you
think
I
forget
your
always
coming
home
to
*NL*
sell
and
pocket
everything
,
and
going
off
again
leaving
us
in
the
*NL*
lurch
?
I
should
be
glad
to
see
you
whipped
at
the
cart-tail
.
My
*NL*
mother
was
a
fool
to
you
:
she
'd
no
right
to
give
me
a
father-in-law
,
*NL*
and
she
's
been
punished
for
it
.
She
shall
have
her
weekly
allowance
*NL*
paid
and
no
more
:
and
that
shall
be
stopped
if
you
dare
to
come
on
to
*NL*
these
premises
again
,
or
to
come
into
this
country
after
me
again
.
The
*NL*
next
time
you
show
yourself
inside
the
gates
here
,
you
shall
be
driven
*NL*
off
with
the
dogs
and
the
wagoner
's
whip
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
Rigg
pronounced
the
last
words
he
turned
round
and
looked
at
Raffles
*NL*
with
his
prominent
frozen
eyes
.
The
contrast
was
as
striking
as
it
*NL*
could
have
been
eighteen
years
before
,
when
Rigg
was
a
most
unengaging
*NL*
kickable
boy
,
and
Raffles
was
the
rather
thick-set
Adonis
of
bar-rooms
*NL*
and
back-parlors
.
But
the
advantage
now
was
on
the
side
of
Rigg
,
and
*NL*
auditors
of
this
conversation
might
probably
have
expected
that
Raffles
*NL*
would
retire
with
the
air
of
a
defeated
dog
.
Not
at
all
.
He
made
a
*NL*
grimace
which
was
habitual
with
him
whenever
he
was
``
out
''
in
a
game
;
*NL*
then
subsided
into
a
laugh
,
and
drew
a
brandy-flask
from
his
pocket
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
Josh
,
''
he
said
,
in
a
cajoling
tone
,
``
give
us
a
spoonful
of
*NL*
brandy
,
and
a
sovereign
to
pay
the
way
back
,
and
I
'll
go
.
Honor
*NL*
bright
!
I
'll
go
like
a
bullet
,
_
by
_
Jove
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mind
,
''
said
Rigg
,
drawing
out
a
bunch
of
keys
,
``
if
I
ever
see
you
*NL*
again
,
I
sha
n't
speak
to
you
.
I
do
n't
own
you
any
more
than
if
I
saw
a
*NL*
crow
;
and
if
you
want
to
own
me
you
'll
get
nothing
by
it
but
a
*NL*
character
for
being
what
you
are
--
a
spiteful
,
brassy
,
bullying
rogue
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
a
pity
,
now
,
Josh
,
''
said
Raffles
,
affecting
to
scratch
his
head
*NL*
and
wrinkle
his
brows
upward
as
if
he
were
nonplussed
.
``
I
'm
very
fond
*NL*
of
you
;
_
by
_
Jove
,
I
am
!
There
's
nothing
I
like
better
than
plaguing
*NL*
you
--
you
're
so
like
your
mother
,
and
I
must
do
without
it
.
But
the
*NL*
brandy
and
the
sovereign
's
a
bargain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
jerked
forward
the
flask
and
Rigg
went
to
a
fine
old
oaken
bureau
*NL*
with
his
keys
.
But
Raffles
had
reminded
himself
by
his
movement
with
*NL*
the
flask
that
it
had
become
dangerously
loose
from
its
leather
*NL*
covering
,
and
catching
sight
of
a
folded
paper
which
had
fallen
within
*NL*
the
fender
,
he
took
it
up
and
shoved
it
under
the
leather
so
as
to
make
*NL*
the
glass
firm
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
that
time
Rigg
came
forward
with
a
brandy-bottle
,
filled
the
flask
,
*NL*
and
handed
Raffles
a
sovereign
,
neither
looking
at
him
nor
speaking
to
*NL*
him
.
After
locking
up
the
bureau
again
,
he
walked
to
the
window
and
*NL*
gazed
out
as
impassibly
as
he
had
done
at
the
beginning
of
the
*NL*
interview
,
while
Raffles
took
a
small
allowance
from
the
flask
,
screwed
*NL*
it
up
,
and
deposited
it
in
his
side-pocket
,
with
provoking
slowness
,
*NL*
making
a
grimace
at
his
stepson
's
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Farewell
,
Josh
--
and
if
forever
!
''
said
Raffles
,
turning
back
his
head
*NL*
as
he
opened
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rigg
saw
him
leave
the
grounds
and
enter
the
lane
.
The
gray
day
had
*NL*
turned
to
a
light
drizzling
rain
,
which
freshened
the
hedgerows
and
the
*NL*
grassy
borders
of
the
by-roads
,
and
hastened
the
laborers
who
were
*NL*
loading
the
last
shocks
of
corn
.
Raffles
,
walking
with
the
uneasy
gait
*NL*
of
a
town
loiterer
obliged
to
do
a
bit
of
country
journeying
on
foot
,
*NL*
looked
as
incongruous
amid
this
moist
rural
quiet
and
industry
as
if
he
*NL*
had
been
a
baboon
escaped
from
a
menagerie
.
But
there
were
none
to
*NL*
stare
at
him
except
the
long-weaned
calves
,
and
none
to
show
dislike
of
*NL*
his
appearance
except
the
little
water-rats
which
rustled
away
at
his
*NL*
approach
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
fortunate
enough
when
he
got
on
to
the
highroad
to
be
overtaken
*NL*
by
the
stage-coach
,
which
carried
him
to
Brassing
;
and
there
he
took
*NL*
the
new-made
railway
,
observing
to
his
fellow-passengers
that
he
*NL*
considered
it
pretty
well
seasoned
now
it
had
done
for
Huskisson
.
Mr.
*NL*
Raffles
on
most
occasions
kept
up
the
sense
of
having
been
educated
at
*NL*
an
academy
,
and
being
able
,
if
he
chose
,
to
pass
well
everywhere
;
*NL*
indeed
,
there
was
not
one
of
his
fellow-men
whom
he
did
not
feel
*NL*
himself
in
a
position
to
ridicule
and
torment
,
confident
of
the
*NL*
entertainment
which
he
thus
gave
to
all
the
rest
of
the
company
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
played
this
part
now
with
as
much
spirit
as
if
his
journey
had
been
*NL*
entirely
successful
,
resorting
at
frequent
intervals
to
his
flask
.
The
*NL*
paper
with
which
he
had
wedged
it
was
a
letter
signed
Nicholas
*NL*
Bulstrode
,
but
Raffles
was
not
likely
to
disturb
it
from
its
present
*NL*
useful
position
.

``

*NL*
--
SHAKESPEARE
:
Henry
VIII
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
the
professional
calls
made
by
Lydgate
soon
after
his
return
*NL*
from
his
wedding-journey
was
to
Lowick
Manor
,
in
consequence
of
a
*NL*
letter
which
had
requested
him
to
fix
a
time
for
his
visit
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Casaubon
had
never
put
any
question
concerning
the
nature
of
his
*NL*
illness
to
Lydgate
,
nor
had
he
even
to
Dorothea
betrayed
any
anxiety
as
*NL*
to
how
far
it
might
be
likely
to
cut
short
his
labors
or
his
life
.
On
*NL*
this
point
,
as
on
all
others
,
he
shrank
from
pity
;
and
if
the
suspicion
*NL*
of
being
pitied
for
anything
in
his
lot
surmised
or
known
in
spite
of
*NL*
himself
was
embittering
,
the
idea
of
calling
forth
a
show
of
compassion
*NL*
by
frankly
admitting
an
alarm
or
a
sorrow
was
necessarily
intolerable
*NL*
to
him
.
Every
proud
mind
knows
something
of
this
experience
,
and
*NL*
perhaps
it
is
only
to
be
overcome
by
a
sense
of
fellowship
deep
enough
*NL*
to
make
all
efforts
at
isolation
seem
mean
and
petty
instead
of
*NL*
exalting
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Mr.
Casaubon
was
now
brooding
over
something
through
which
the
*NL*
question
of
his
health
and
life
haunted
his
silence
with
a
more
*NL*
harassing
importunity
even
than
through
the
autumnal
unripeness
of
his
*NL*
authorship
.
It
is
true
that
this
last
might
be
called
his
central
*NL*
ambition
;
but
there
are
some
kinds
of
authorship
in
which
by
far
the
*NL*
largest
result
is
the
uneasy
susceptibility
accumulated
in
the
*NL*
consciousness
of
the
author
--
one
knows
of
the
river
by
a
few
streaks
*NL*
amid
a
long-gathered
deposit
of
uncomfortable
mud
.
That
was
the
way
*NL*
with
Mr.
Casaubon
's
hard
intellectual
labors
.
Their
most
*NL*
characteristic
result
was
not
the
``
Key
to
all
Mythologies
,
''
but
a
*NL*
morbid
consciousness
that
others
did
not
give
him
the
place
which
he
*NL*
had
not
demonstrably
merited
--
a
perpetual
suspicious
conjecture
that
*NL*
the
views
entertained
of
him
were
not
to
his
advantage
--
a
melancholy
*NL*
absence
of
passion
in
his
efforts
at
achievement
,
and
a
passionate
*NL*
resistance
to
the
confession
that
he
had
achieved
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
his
intellectual
ambition
which
seemed
to
others
to
have
absorbed
*NL*
and
dried
him
,
was
really
no
security
against
wounds
,
least
of
all
*NL*
against
those
which
came
from
Dorothea
.
And
he
had
begun
now
to
frame
*NL*
possibilities
for
the
future
which
were
somehow
more
embittering
to
him
*NL*
than
anything
his
mind
had
dwelt
on
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
Against
certain
facts
he
was
helpless
:
against
Will
Ladislaw
's
*NL*
existence
,
his
defiant
stay
in
the
neighborhood
of
Lowick
,
and
his
*NL*
flippant
state
of
mind
with
regard
to
the
possessors
of
authentic
,
*NL*
well-stamped
erudition
:
against
Dorothea
's
nature
,
always
taking
on
*NL*
some
new
shape
of
ardent
activity
,
and
even
in
submission
and
silence
*NL*
covering
fervid
reasons
which
it
was
an
irritation
to
think
of
:
against
*NL*
certain
notions
and
likings
which
had
taken
possession
of
her
mind
in
*NL*
relation
to
subjects
that
he
could
not
possibly
discuss
with
her
.
*NL*
There
was
no
denying
that
Dorothea
was
as
virtuous
and
lovely
a
young
*NL*
lady
as
he
could
have
obtained
for
a
wife
;
but
a
young
lady
turned
out
*NL*
to
be
something
more
troublesome
than
he
had
conceived
.
She
nursed
*NL*
him
,
she
read
to
him
,
she
anticipated
his
wants
,
and
was
solicitous
*NL*
about
his
feelings
;
but
there
had
entered
into
the
husband
's
mind
the
*NL*
certainty
that
she
judged
him
,
and
that
her
wifely
devotedness
was
like
*NL*
a
penitential
expiation
of
unbelieving
thoughts
--
was
accompanied
with
a
*NL*
power
of
comparison
by
which
himself
and
his
doings
were
seen
too
*NL*
luminously
as
a
part
of
things
in
general
.
His
discontent
passed
*NL*
vapor-like
through
all
her
gentle
loving
manifestations
,
and
clung
to
*NL*
that
inappreciative
world
which
she
had
only
brought
nearer
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Mr.
Casaubon
!
This
suffering
was
the
harder
to
bear
because
it
*NL*
seemed
like
a
betrayal
:
the
young
creature
who
had
worshipped
him
with
*NL*
perfect
trust
had
quickly
turned
into
the
critical
wife
;
and
early
*NL*
instances
of
criticism
and
resentment
had
made
an
impression
which
no
*NL*
tenderness
and
submission
afterwards
could
remove
.
To
his
suspicious
*NL*
interpretation
Dorothea
's
silence
now
was
a
suppressed
rebellion
;
a
*NL*
remark
from
her
which
he
had
not
in
any
way
anticipated
was
an
*NL*
assertion
of
conscious
superiority
;
her
gentle
answers
had
an
*NL*
irritating
cautiousness
in
them
;
and
when
she
acquiesced
it
was
a
*NL*
self-approved
effort
of
forbearance
.
The
tenacity
with
which
he
strove
*NL*
to
hide
this
inward
drama
made
it
the
more
vivid
for
him
;
as
we
hear
*NL*
with
the
more
keenness
what
we
wish
others
not
to
hear
.
*NL*
*NL*
Instead
of
wondering
at
this
result
of
misery
in
Mr.
Casaubon
,
I
think
*NL*
it
quite
ordinary
.
Will
not
a
tiny
speck
very
close
to
our
vision
blot
*NL*
out
the
glory
of
the
world
,
and
leave
only
a
margin
by
which
we
see
the
*NL*
blot
?
I
know
no
speck
so
troublesome
as
self
.
And
who
,
if
Mr.
*NL*
Casaubon
had
chosen
to
expound
his
discontents
--
his
suspicions
that
he
*NL*
was
not
any
longer
adored
without
criticism
--
could
have
denied
that
*NL*
they
were
founded
on
good
reasons
?
On
the
contrary
,
there
was
a
strong
*NL*
reason
to
be
added
,
which
he
had
not
himself
taken
explicitly
into
*NL*
account
--
namely
,
that
he
was
not
unmixedly
adorable
.
He
suspected
*NL*
this
,
however
,
as
he
suspected
other
things
,
without
confessing
it
,
and
*NL*
like
the
rest
of
us
,
felt
how
soothing
it
would
have
been
to
have
a
*NL*
companion
who
would
never
find
it
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
sore
susceptibility
in
relation
to
Dorothea
was
thoroughly
*NL*
prepared
before
Will
Ladislaw
had
returned
to
Lowick
,
and
what
had
*NL*
occurred
since
then
had
brought
Mr.
Casaubon
's
power
of
suspicious
*NL*
construction
into
exasperated
activity
.
To
all
the
facts
which
he
*NL*
knew
,
he
added
imaginary
facts
both
present
and
future
which
became
*NL*
more
real
to
him
than
those
because
they
called
up
a
stronger
dislike
,
*NL*
a
more
predominating
bitterness
.
Suspicion
and
jealousy
of
Will
*NL*
Ladislaw
's
intentions
,
suspicion
and
jealousy
of
Dorothea
's
*NL*
impressions
,
were
constantly
at
their
weaving
work
.
It
would
be
quite
*NL*
unjust
to
him
to
suppose
that
he
could
have
entered
into
any
coarse
*NL*
misinterpretation
of
Dorothea
:
his
own
habits
of
mind
and
conduct
,
*NL*
quite
as
much
as
the
open
elevation
of
her
nature
,
saved
him
from
any
*NL*
such
mistake
.
What
he
was
jealous
of
was
her
opinion
,
the
sway
that
*NL*
might
be
given
to
her
ardent
mind
in
its
judgments
,
and
the
future
*NL*
possibilities
to
which
these
might
lead
her
.
As
to
Will
,
though
until
*NL*
his
last
defiant
letter
he
had
nothing
definite
which
he
would
choose
*NL*
formally
to
allege
against
him
,
he
felt
himself
warranted
in
believing
*NL*
that
he
was
capable
of
any
design
which
could
fascinate
a
rebellious
*NL*
temper
and
an
undisciplined
impulsiveness
.
He
was
quite
sure
that
*NL*
Dorothea
was
the
cause
of
Will
's
return
from
Rome
,
and
his
*NL*
determination
to
settle
in
the
neighborhood
;
and
he
was
penetrating
*NL*
enough
to
imagine
that
Dorothea
had
innocently
encouraged
this
course
.
*NL*
It
was
as
clear
as
possible
that
she
was
ready
to
be
attached
to
Will
*NL*
and
to
be
pliant
to
his
suggestions
:
they
had
never
had
a
tete-a-tete
*NL*
without
her
bringing
away
from
it
some
new
troublesome
impression
,
and
*NL*
the
last
interview
that
Mr.
Casaubon
was
aware
of
-LRB-
Dorothea
,
on
*NL*
returning
from
Freshitt
Hall
,
had
for
the
first
time
been
silent
about
*NL*
having
seen
Will
-RRB-
had
led
to
a
scene
which
roused
an
angrier
feeling
*NL*
against
them
both
than
he
had
ever
known
before
.
Dorothea
's
outpouring
*NL*
of
her
notions
about
money
,
in
the
darkness
of
the
night
,
had
done
*NL*
nothing
but
bring
a
mixture
of
more
odious
foreboding
into
her
*NL*
husband
's
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
there
was
the
shock
lately
given
to
his
health
always
sadly
present
*NL*
with
him
.
He
was
certainly
much
revived
;
he
had
recovered
all
his
*NL*
usual
power
of
work
:
the
illness
might
have
been
mere
fatigue
,
and
*NL*
there
might
still
be
twenty
years
of
achievement
before
him
,
which
*NL*
would
justify
the
thirty
years
of
preparation
.
That
prospect
was
made
*NL*
the
sweeter
by
a
flavor
of
vengeance
against
the
hasty
sneers
of
Carp
&
*NL*
Company
;
for
even
when
Mr.
Casaubon
was
carrying
his
taper
among
the
*NL*
tombs
of
the
past
,
those
modern
figures
came
athwart
the
dim
light
,
and
*NL*
interrupted
his
diligent
exploration
.
To
convince
Carp
of
his
mistake
,
*NL*
so
that
he
would
have
to
eat
his
own
words
with
a
good
deal
of
*NL*
indigestion
,
would
be
an
agreeable
accident
of
triumphant
authorship
,
*NL*
which
the
prospect
of
living
to
future
ages
on
earth
and
to
all
*NL*
eternity
in
heaven
could
not
exclude
from
contemplation
.
Since
,
thus
,
*NL*
the
prevision
of
his
own
unending
bliss
could
not
nullify
the
bitter
*NL*
savors
of
irritated
jealousy
and
vindictiveness
,
it
is
the
less
*NL*
surprising
that
the
probability
of
a
transient
earthly
bliss
for
other
*NL*
persons
,
when
he
himself
should
have
entered
into
glory
,
had
not
a
*NL*
potently
sweetening
effect
.
If
the
truth
should
be
that
some
*NL*
undermining
disease
was
at
work
within
him
,
there
might
be
large
*NL*
opportunity
for
some
people
to
be
the
happier
when
he
was
gone
;
and
if
*NL*
one
of
those
people
should
be
Will
Ladislaw
,
Mr.
Casaubon
objected
so
*NL*
strongly
that
it
seemed
as
if
the
annoyance
would
make
part
of
his
*NL*
disembodied
existence
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
is
a
very
bare
and
therefore
a
very
incomplete
way
of
putting
the
*NL*
case
.
The
human
soul
moves
in
many
channels
,
and
Mr.
Casaubon
,
we
*NL*
know
,
had
a
sense
of
rectitude
and
an
honorable
pride
in
satisfying
the
*NL*
requirements
of
honor
,
which
compelled
him
to
find
other
reasons
for
*NL*
his
conduct
than
those
of
jealousy
and
vindictiveness
.
The
way
in
*NL*
which
Mr.
Casaubon
put
the
case
was
this
:
--
``
In
marrying
Dorothea
Brooke
*NL*
I
had
to
care
for
her
well-being
in
case
of
my
death
.
But
well-being
*NL*
is
not
to
be
secured
by
ample
,
independent
possession
of
property
;
on
*NL*
the
contrary
,
occasions
might
arise
in
which
such
possession
might
*NL*
expose
her
to
the
more
danger
.
She
is
ready
prey
to
any
man
who
knows
*NL*
how
to
play
adroitly
either
on
her
affectionate
ardor
or
her
Quixotic
*NL*
enthusiasm
;
and
a
man
stands
by
with
that
very
intention
in
his
mind
--
a
*NL*
man
with
no
other
principle
than
transient
caprice
,
and
who
has
a
*NL*
personal
animosity
towards
me
--
I
am
sure
of
it
--
an
animosity
which
is
*NL*
fed
by
the
consciousness
of
his
ingratitude
,
and
which
he
has
*NL*
constantly
vented
in
ridicule
of
which
I
am
as
well
assured
as
if
I
had
*NL*
heard
it
.
Even
if
I
live
I
shall
not
be
without
uneasiness
as
to
what
*NL*
he
may
attempt
through
indirect
influence
.
This
man
has
gained
*NL*
Dorothea
's
ear
:
he
has
fascinated
her
attention
;
he
has
evidently
tried
*NL*
to
impress
her
mind
with
the
notion
that
he
has
claims
beyond
anything
*NL*
I
have
done
for
him
.
If
I
die
--
and
he
is
waiting
here
on
the
watch
for
*NL*
that
--
he
will
persuade
her
to
marry
him
.
That
would
be
calamity
for
*NL*
her
and
success
for
him
.
_
She
_
would
not
think
it
calamity
:
he
would
*NL*
make
her
believe
anything
;
she
has
a
tendency
to
immoderate
attachment
*NL*
which
she
inwardly
reproaches
me
for
not
responding
to
,
and
already
her
*NL*
mind
is
occupied
with
his
fortunes
.
He
thinks
of
an
easy
conquest
and
*NL*
of
entering
into
my
nest
.
That
I
will
hinder
!
Such
a
marriage
would
be
*NL*
fatal
to
Dorothea
.
Has
he
ever
persisted
in
anything
except
from
*NL*
contradiction
?
In
knowledge
he
has
always
tried
to
be
showy
at
small
*NL*
cost
.
In
religion
he
could
be
,
as
long
as
it
suited
him
,
the
facile
*NL*
echo
of
Dorothea
's
vagaries
.
When
was
sciolism
ever
dissociated
from
*NL*
laxity
?
I
utterly
distrust
his
morals
,
and
it
is
my
duty
to
hinder
to
*NL*
the
utmost
the
fulfilment
of
his
designs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
arrangements
made
by
Mr.
Casaubon
on
his
marriage
left
strong
*NL*
measures
open
to
him
,
but
in
ruminating
on
them
his
mind
inevitably
*NL*
dwelt
so
much
on
the
probabilities
of
his
own
life
that
the
longing
to
*NL*
get
the
nearest
possible
calculation
had
at
last
overcome
his
proud
*NL*
reticence
,
and
had
determined
him
to
ask
Lydgate
's
opinion
as
to
the
*NL*
nature
of
his
illness
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
mentioned
to
Dorothea
that
Lydgate
was
coming
by
appointment
at
*NL*
half-past
three
,
and
in
answer
to
her
anxious
question
,
whether
he
had
*NL*
felt
ill
,
replied
,
--
``
No
,
I
merely
wish
to
have
his
opinion
concerning
*NL*
some
habitual
symptoms
.
You
need
not
see
him
,
my
dear
.
I
shall
give
*NL*
orders
that
he
may
be
sent
to
me
in
the
Yew-tree
Walk
,
where
I
shall
be
*NL*
taking
my
usual
exercise
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
Lydgate
entered
the
Yew-tree
Walk
he
saw
Mr.
Casaubon
slowly
*NL*
receding
with
his
hands
behind
him
according
to
his
habit
,
and
his
head
*NL*
bent
forward
.
It
was
a
lovely
afternoon
;
the
leaves
from
the
lofty
*NL*
limes
were
falling
silently
across
the
sombre
evergreens
,
while
the
*NL*
lights
and
shadows
slept
side
by
side
:
there
was
no
sound
but
the
*NL*
cawing
of
the
rooks
,
which
to
the
accustomed
ear
is
a
lullaby
,
or
that
*NL*
last
solemn
lullaby
,
a
dirge
.
Lydgate
,
conscious
of
an
energetic
frame
*NL*
in
its
prime
,
felt
some
compassion
when
the
figure
which
he
was
likely
*NL*
soon
to
overtake
turned
round
,
and
in
advancing
towards
him
showed
more
*NL*
markedly
than
ever
the
signs
of
premature
age
--
the
student
's
bent
*NL*
shoulders
,
the
emaciated
limbs
,
and
the
melancholy
lines
of
the
mouth
.
*NL*
``
Poor
fellow
,
''
he
thought
,
``
some
men
with
his
years
are
like
lions
;
one
*NL*
can
tell
nothing
of
their
age
except
that
they
are
full
grown
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Lydgate
,
''
said
Mr.
Casaubon
,
with
his
invariably
polite
air
,
``
I
am
*NL*
exceedingly
obliged
to
you
for
your
punctuality
.
We
will
,
if
you
*NL*
please
,
carry
on
our
conversation
in
walking
to
and
fro
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
your
wish
to
see
me
is
not
due
to
the
return
of
unpleasant
*NL*
symptoms
,
''
said
Lydgate
,
filling
up
a
pause
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
immediately
--
no
.
In
order
to
account
for
that
wish
I
must
*NL*
mention
--
what
it
were
otherwise
needless
to
refer
to
--
that
my
life
,
on
*NL*
all
collateral
accounts
insignificant
,
derives
a
possible
importance
*NL*
from
the
incompleteness
of
labors
which
have
extended
through
all
its
*NL*
best
years
.
In
short
,
I
have
long
had
on
hand
a
work
which
I
would
*NL*
fain
leave
behind
me
in
such
a
state
,
at
least
,
that
it
might
be
*NL*
committed
to
the
press
by
--
others
.
Were
I
assured
that
this
is
the
*NL*
utmost
I
can
reasonably
expect
,
that
assurance
would
be
a
useful
*NL*
circumscription
of
my
attempts
,
and
a
guide
in
both
the
positive
and
*NL*
negative
determination
of
my
course
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
Mr.
Casaubon
paused
,
removed
one
hand
from
his
back
and
thrust
it
*NL*
between
the
buttons
of
his
single-breasted
coat
.
To
a
mind
largely
*NL*
instructed
in
the
human
destiny
hardly
anything
could
be
more
*NL*
interesting
than
the
inward
conflict
implied
in
his
formal
measured
*NL*
address
,
delivered
with
the
usual
sing-song
and
motion
of
the
head
.
*NL*
Nay
,
are
there
many
situations
more
sublimely
tragic
than
the
struggle
*NL*
of
the
soul
with
the
demand
to
renounce
a
work
which
has
been
all
the
*NL*
significance
of
its
life
--
a
significance
which
is
to
vanish
as
the
*NL*
waters
which
come
and
go
where
no
man
has
need
of
them
?
But
there
was
*NL*
nothing
to
strike
others
as
sublime
about
Mr.
Casaubon
,
and
Lydgate
,
*NL*
who
had
some
contempt
at
hand
for
futile
scholarship
,
felt
a
little
*NL*
amusement
mingling
with
his
pity
.
He
was
at
present
too
ill
acquainted
*NL*
with
disaster
to
enter
into
the
pathos
of
a
lot
where
everything
is
*NL*
below
the
level
of
tragedy
except
the
passionate
egoism
of
the
sufferer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
refer
to
the
possible
hindrances
from
want
of
health
?
''
he
said
,
*NL*
wishing
to
help
forward
Mr.
Casaubon
's
purpose
,
which
seemed
to
be
*NL*
clogged
by
some
hesitation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
.
You
have
not
implied
to
me
that
the
symptoms
which
--
I
am
bound
*NL*
to
testify
--
you
watched
with
scrupulous
care
,
were
those
of
a
fatal
*NL*
disease
.
But
were
it
so
,
Mr.
Lydgate
,
I
should
desire
to
know
the
*NL*
truth
without
reservation
,
and
I
appeal
to
you
for
an
exact
statement
*NL*
of
your
conclusions
:
I
request
it
as
a
friendly
service
.
If
you
can
*NL*
tell
me
that
my
life
is
not
threatened
by
anything
else
than
ordinary
*NL*
casualties
,
I
shall
rejoice
,
on
grounds
which
I
have
already
indicated
.
*NL*
If
not
,
knowledge
of
the
truth
is
even
more
important
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
can
no
longer
hesitate
as
to
my
course
,
''
said
Lydgate
;
``
but
the
*NL*
first
thing
I
must
impress
on
you
is
that
my
conclusions
are
doubly
*NL*
uncertain
--
uncertain
not
only
because
of
my
fallibility
,
but
because
*NL*
diseases
of
the
heart
are
eminently
difficult
to
found
predictions
on
.
*NL*
In
any
case
,
one
can
hardly
increase
appreciably
the
tremendous
*NL*
uncertainty
of
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Casaubon
winced
perceptibly
,
but
bowed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
that
you
are
suffering
from
what
is
called
fatty
*NL*
degeneration
of
the
heart
,
a
disease
which
was
first
divined
and
*NL*
explored
by
Laennec
,
the
man
who
gave
us
the
stethoscope
,
not
so
very
*NL*
many
years
ago
.
A
good
deal
of
experience
--
a
more
lengthened
*NL*
observation
--
is
wanting
on
the
subject
.
But
after
what
you
have
said
,
*NL*
it
is
my
duty
to
tell
you
that
death
from
this
disease
is
often
sudden
.
*NL*
At
the
same
time
,
no
such
result
can
be
predicted
.
Your
condition
may
*NL*
be
consistent
with
a
tolerably
comfortable
life
for
another
fifteen
*NL*
years
,
or
even
more
.
I
could
add
no
information
to
this
beyond
*NL*
anatomical
or
medical
details
,
which
would
leave
expectation
at
*NL*
precisely
the
same
point
.
''
Lydgate
's
instinct
was
fine
enough
to
tell
*NL*
him
that
plain
speech
,
quite
free
from
ostentatious
caution
,
would
be
*NL*
felt
by
Mr.
Casaubon
as
a
tribute
of
respect
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thank
you
,
Mr.
Lydgate
,
''
said
Mr.
Casaubon
,
after
a
moment
's
pause
.
*NL*
``
One
thing
more
I
have
still
to
ask
:
did
you
communicate
what
you
have
*NL*
now
told
me
to
Mrs.
Casaubon
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Partly
--
I
mean
,
as
to
the
possible
issues
.
''
Lydgate
was
going
to
*NL*
explain
why
he
had
told
Dorothea
,
but
Mr.
Casaubon
,
with
an
*NL*
unmistakable
desire
to
end
the
conversation
,
waved
his
hand
slightly
,
*NL*
and
said
again
,
``
I
thank
you
,
''
proceeding
to
remark
on
the
rare
beauty
*NL*
of
the
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lydgate
,
certain
that
his
patient
wished
to
be
alone
,
soon
left
him
;
*NL*
and
the
black
figure
with
hands
behind
and
head
bent
forward
continued
*NL*
to
pace
the
walk
where
the
dark
yew-trees
gave
him
a
mute
companionship
*NL*
in
melancholy
,
and
the
little
shadows
of
bird
or
leaf
that
fleeted
*NL*
across
the
isles
of
sunlight
,
stole
along
in
silence
as
in
the
presence
*NL*
of
a
sorrow
.
Here
was
a
man
who
now
for
the
first
time
found
himself
*NL*
looking
into
the
eyes
of
death
--
who
was
passing
through
one
of
those
*NL*
rare
moments
of
experience
when
we
feel
the
truth
of
a
commonplace
,
*NL*
which
is
as
different
from
what
we
call
knowing
it
,
as
the
vision
of
*NL*
waters
upon
the
earth
is
different
from
the
delirious
vision
of
the
*NL*
water
which
can
not
be
had
to
cool
the
burning
tongue
.
When
the
*NL*
commonplace
``
We
must
all
die
''
transforms
itself
suddenly
into
the
acute
*NL*
consciousness
``
I
must
die
--
and
soon
,
''
then
death
grapples
us
,
and
his
*NL*
fingers
are
cruel
;
afterwards
,
he
may
come
to
fold
us
in
his
arms
as
*NL*
our
mother
did
,
and
our
last
moment
of
dim
earthly
discerning
may
be
*NL*
like
the
first
.
To
Mr.
Casaubon
now
,
it
was
as
if
he
suddenly
found
*NL*
himself
on
the
dark
river-brink
and
heard
the
plash
of
the
oncoming
*NL*
oar
,
not
discerning
the
forms
,
but
expecting
the
summons
.
In
such
an
*NL*
hour
the
mind
does
not
change
its
lifelong
bias
,
but
carries
it
onward
*NL*
in
imagination
to
the
other
side
of
death
,
gazing
backward
--
perhaps
*NL*
with
the
divine
calm
of
beneficence
,
perhaps
with
the
petty
anxieties
*NL*
of
self-assertion
.
What
was
Mr.
Casaubon
's
bias
his
acts
will
give
us
a
*NL*
clew
to
.
He
held
himself
to
be
,
with
some
private
scholarly
*NL*
reservations
,
a
believing
Christian
,
as
to
estimates
of
the
present
and
*NL*
hopes
of
the
future
.
But
what
we
strive
to
gratify
,
though
we
may
call
*NL*
it
a
distant
hope
,
is
an
immediate
desire
:
the
future
estate
for
which
*NL*
men
drudge
up
city
alleys
exists
already
in
their
imagination
and
love
.
*NL*
And
Mr.
Casaubon
's
immediate
desire
was
not
for
divine
communion
and
*NL*
light
divested
of
earthly
conditions
;
his
passionate
longings
,
poor
*NL*
man
,
clung
low
and
mist-like
in
very
shady
places
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
had
been
aware
when
Lydgate
had
ridden
away
,
and
she
had
*NL*
stepped
into
the
garden
,
with
the
impulse
to
go
at
once
to
her
husband
.
*NL*
But
she
hesitated
,
fearing
to
offend
him
by
obtruding
herself
;
for
her
*NL*
ardor
,
continually
repulsed
,
served
,
with
her
intense
memory
,
to
*NL*
heighten
her
dread
,
as
thwarted
energy
subsides
into
a
shudder
;
and
she
*NL*
wandered
slowly
round
the
nearer
clumps
of
trees
until
she
saw
him
*NL*
advancing
.
Then
she
went
towards
him
,
and
might
have
represented
a
*NL*
heaven-sent
angel
coming
with
a
promise
that
the
short
hours
remaining
*NL*
should
yet
be
filled
with
that
faithful
love
which
clings
the
closer
to
*NL*
a
comprehended
grief
.
His
glance
in
reply
to
hers
was
so
chill
that
*NL*
she
felt
her
timidity
increased
;
yet
she
turned
and
passed
her
hand
*NL*
through
his
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Casaubon
kept
his
hands
behind
him
and
allowed
her
pliant
arm
to
*NL*
cling
with
difficulty
against
his
rigid
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
something
horrible
to
Dorothea
in
the
sensation
which
this
*NL*
unresponsive
hardness
inflicted
on
her
.
That
is
a
strong
word
,
but
not
*NL*
too
strong
:
it
is
in
these
acts
called
trivialities
that
the
seeds
of
*NL*
joy
are
forever
wasted
,
until
men
and
women
look
round
with
haggard
*NL*
faces
at
the
devastation
their
own
waste
has
made
,
and
say
,
the
earth
*NL*
bears
no
harvest
of
sweetness
--
calling
their
denial
knowledge
.
You
may
*NL*
ask
why
,
in
the
name
of
manliness
,
Mr.
Casaubon
should
have
behaved
in
*NL*
that
way
.
Consider
that
his
was
a
mind
which
shrank
from
pity
:
have
*NL*
you
ever
watched
in
such
a
mind
the
effect
of
a
suspicion
that
what
is
*NL*
pressing
it
as
a
grief
may
be
really
a
source
of
contentment
,
either
*NL*
actual
or
future
,
to
the
being
who
already
offends
by
pitying
?
*NL*
Besides
,
he
knew
little
of
Dorothea
's
sensations
,
and
had
not
reflected
*NL*
that
on
such
an
occasion
as
the
present
they
were
comparable
in
*NL*
strength
to
his
own
sensibilities
about
Carp
's
criticisms
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
did
not
withdraw
her
arm
,
but
she
could
not
venture
to
speak
.
*NL*
Mr.
Casaubon
did
not
say
,
``
I
wish
to
be
alone
,
''
but
he
directed
his
*NL*
steps
in
silence
towards
the
house
,
and
as
they
entered
by
the
glass
*NL*
door
on
this
eastern
side
,
Dorothea
withdrew
her
arm
and
lingered
on
*NL*
the
matting
,
that
she
might
leave
her
husband
quite
free
.
He
entered
*NL*
the
library
and
shut
himself
in
,
alone
with
his
sorrow
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
went
up
to
her
boudoir
.
The
open
bow-window
let
in
the
serene
*NL*
glory
of
the
afternoon
lying
in
the
avenue
,
where
the
lime-trees
cast
*NL*
long
shadows
.
But
Dorothea
knew
nothing
of
the
scene
.
She
threw
*NL*
herself
on
a
chair
,
not
heeding
that
she
was
in
the
dazzling
sun-rays
:
*NL*
if
there
were
discomfort
in
that
,
how
could
she
tell
that
it
was
not
*NL*
part
of
her
inward
misery
?
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
in
the
reaction
of
a
rebellious
anger
stronger
than
any
she
had
*NL*
felt
since
her
marriage
.
Instead
of
tears
there
came
words
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
have
I
done
--
what
am
I
--
that
he
should
treat
me
so
?
He
never
*NL*
knows
what
is
in
my
mind
--
he
never
cares
.
What
is
the
use
of
anything
*NL*
I
do
?
He
wishes
he
had
never
married
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
began
to
hear
herself
,
and
was
checked
into
stillness
.
Like
one
*NL*
who
has
lost
his
way
and
is
weary
,
she
sat
and
saw
as
in
one
glance
all
*NL*
the
paths
of
her
young
hope
which
she
should
never
find
again
.
And
*NL*
just
as
clearly
in
the
miserable
light
she
saw
her
own
and
her
*NL*
husband
's
solitude
--
how
they
walked
apart
so
that
she
was
obliged
to
*NL*
survey
him
.
If
he
had
drawn
her
towards
him
,
she
would
never
have
*NL*
surveyed
him
--
never
have
said
,
``
Is
he
worth
living
for
?
''
but
would
have
*NL*
felt
him
simply
a
part
of
her
own
life
.
Now
she
said
bitterly
,
``
It
is
*NL*
his
fault
,
not
mine
.
''
In
the
jar
of
her
whole
being
,
Pity
was
*NL*
overthrown
.
Was
it
her
fault
that
she
had
believed
in
him
--
had
*NL*
believed
in
his
worthiness
?
--
And
what
,
exactly
,
was
he
?
--
She
was
able
*NL*
enough
to
estimate
him
--
she
who
waited
on
his
glances
with
trembling
,
*NL*
and
shut
her
best
soul
in
prison
,
paying
it
only
hidden
visits
,
that
*NL*
she
might
be
petty
enough
to
please
him
.
In
such
a
crisis
as
this
,
*NL*
some
women
begin
to
hate
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sun
was
low
when
Dorothea
was
thinking
that
she
would
not
go
down
*NL*
again
,
but
would
send
a
message
to
her
husband
saying
that
she
was
not
*NL*
well
and
preferred
remaining
up-stairs
.
She
had
never
deliberately
*NL*
allowed
her
resentment
to
govern
her
in
this
way
before
,
but
she
*NL*
believed
now
that
she
could
not
see
him
again
without
telling
him
the
*NL*
truth
about
her
feeling
,
and
she
must
wait
till
she
could
do
it
without
*NL*
interruption
.
He
might
wonder
and
be
hurt
at
her
message
.
It
was
good
*NL*
that
he
should
wonder
and
be
hurt
.
Her
anger
said
,
as
anger
is
apt
to
*NL*
say
,
that
God
was
with
her
--
that
all
heaven
,
though
it
were
crowded
*NL*
with
spirits
watching
them
,
must
be
on
her
side
.
She
had
determined
to
*NL*
ring
her
bell
,
when
there
came
a
rap
at
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Casaubon
had
sent
to
say
that
he
would
have
his
dinner
in
the
*NL*
library
.
He
wished
to
be
quite
alone
this
evening
,
being
much
occupied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
not
dine
,
then
,
Tantripp
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
madam
,
let
me
bring
you
a
little
something
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
I
am
not
well
.
Get
everything
ready
in
my
dressing
room
,
but
pray
*NL*
do
not
disturb
me
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
sat
almost
motionless
in
her
meditative
struggle
,
while
the
*NL*
evening
slowly
deepened
into
night
.
But
the
struggle
changed
*NL*
continually
,
as
that
of
a
man
who
begins
with
a
movement
towards
*NL*
striking
and
ends
with
conquering
his
desire
to
strike
.
The
energy
*NL*
that
would
animate
a
crime
is
not
more
than
is
wanted
to
inspire
a
*NL*
resolved
submission
,
when
the
noble
habit
of
the
soul
reasserts
itself
.
*NL*
That
thought
with
which
Dorothea
had
gone
out
to
meet
her
husband
--
her
*NL*
conviction
that
he
had
been
asking
about
the
possible
arrest
of
all
his
*NL*
work
,
and
that
the
answer
must
have
wrung
his
heart
,
could
not
be
long
*NL*
without
rising
beside
the
image
of
him
,
like
a
shadowy
monitor
looking
*NL*
at
her
anger
with
sad
remonstrance
.
It
cost
her
a
litany
of
pictured
*NL*
sorrows
and
of
silent
cries
that
she
might
be
the
mercy
for
those
*NL*
sorrows
--
but
the
resolved
submission
did
come
;
and
when
the
house
was
*NL*
still
,
and
she
knew
that
it
was
near
the
time
when
Mr.
Casaubon
*NL*
habitually
went
to
rest
,
she
opened
her
door
gently
and
stood
outside
*NL*
in
the
darkness
waiting
for
his
coming
up-stairs
with
a
light
in
his
*NL*
hand
.
If
he
did
not
come
soon
she
thought
that
she
would
go
down
and
*NL*
even
risk
incurring
another
pang
.
She
would
never
again
expect
*NL*
anything
else
.
But
she
did
hear
the
library
door
open
,
and
slowly
the
*NL*
light
advanced
up
the
staircase
without
noise
from
the
footsteps
on
the
*NL*
carpet
.
When
her
husband
stood
opposite
to
her
,
she
saw
that
his
face
*NL*
was
more
haggard
.
He
started
slightly
on
seeing
her
,
and
she
looked
up
*NL*
at
him
beseechingly
,
without
speaking
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dorothea
!
''
he
said
,
with
a
gentle
surprise
in
his

When

*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
seldom
left
home
without
her
husband
,
but
she
did
occasionally
*NL*
drive
into
Middlemarch
alone
,
on
little
errands
of
shopping
or
charity
*NL*
such
as
occur
to
every
lady
of
any
wealth
when
she
lives
within
three
*NL*
miles
of
a
town
.
Two
days
after
that
scene
in
the
Yew-tree
Walk
,
she
*NL*
determined
to
use
such
an
opportunity
in
order
if
possible
to
see
*NL*
Lydgate
,
and
learn
from
him
whether
her
husband
had
really
felt
any
*NL*
depressing
change
of
symptoms
which
he
was
concealing
from
her
,
and
*NL*
whether
he
had
insisted
on
knowing
the
utmost
about
himself
.
She
felt
*NL*
almost
guilty
in
asking
for
knowledge
about
him
from
another
,
but
the
*NL*
dread
of
being
without
it
--
the
dread
of
that
ignorance
which
would
make
*NL*
her
unjust
or
hard
--
overcame
every
scruple
.
That
there
had
been
some
*NL*
crisis
in
her
husband
's
mind
she
was
certain
:
he
had
the
very
next
day
*NL*
begun
a
new
method
of
arranging
his
notes
,
and
had
associated
her
quite
*NL*
newly
in
carrying
out
his
plan
.
Poor
Dorothea
needed
to
lay
up
stores
*NL*
of
patience
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
about
four
o'clock
when
she
drove
to
Lydgate
's
house
in
Lowick
*NL*
Gate
,
wishing
,
in
her
immediate
doubt
of
finding
him
at
home
,
that
she
*NL*
had
written
beforehand
.
And
he
was
not
at
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
Mrs.
Lydgate
at
home
?
''
said
Dorothea
,
who
had
never
,
that
she
knew
*NL*
of
,
seen
Rosamond
,
but
now
remembered
the
fact
of
the
marriage
.
Yes
,
*NL*
Mrs.
Lydgate
was
at
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
go
in
and
speak
to
her
,
if
she
will
allow
me
.
Will
you
ask
her
*NL*
if
she
can
see
me
--
see
Mrs.
Casaubon
,
for
a
few
minutes
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
servant
had
gone
to
deliver
that
message
,
Dorothea
could
hear
*NL*
sounds
of
music
through
an
open
window
--
a
few
notes
from
a
man
's
voice
*NL*
and
then
a
piano
bursting
into
roulades
.
But
the
roulades
broke
off
*NL*
suddenly
,
and
then
the
servant
came
back
saying
that
Mrs.
Lydgate
would
*NL*
be
happy
to
see
Mrs.
Casaubon
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
drawing-room
door
opened
and
Dorothea
entered
,
there
was
a
*NL*
sort
of
contrast
not
infrequent
in
country
life
when
the
habits
of
the
*NL*
different
ranks
were
less
blent
than
now
.
Let
those
who
know
,
tell
us
*NL*
exactly
what
stuff
it
was
that
Dorothea
wore
in
those
days
of
mild
*NL*
autumn
--
that
thin
white
woollen
stuff
soft
to
the
touch
and
soft
to
the
*NL*
eye
.
It
always
seemed
to
have
been
lately
washed
,
and
to
smell
of
the
*NL*
sweet
hedges
--
was
always
in
the
shape
of
a
pelisse
with
sleeves
hanging
*NL*
all
out
of
the
fashion
.
Yet
if
she
had
entered
before
a
still
audience
*NL*
as
Imogene
or
Cato
's
daughter
,
the
dress
might
have
seemed
right
*NL*
enough
:
the
grace
and
dignity
were
in
her
limbs
and
neck
;
and
about
her
*NL*
simply
parted
hair
and
candid
eyes
the
large
round
poke
which
was
then
*NL*
in
the
fate
of
women
,
seemed
no
more
odd
as
a
head-dress
than
the
gold
*NL*
trencher
we
call
a
halo
.
By
the
present
audience
of
two
persons
,
no
*NL*
dramatic
heroine
could
have
been
expected
with
more
interest
than
Mrs.
*NL*
Casaubon
.
To
Rosamond
she
was
one
of
those
county
divinities
not
*NL*
mixing
with
Middlemarch
mortality
,
whose
slightest
marks
of
manner
or
*NL*
appearance
were
worthy
of
her
study
;
moreover
,
Rosamond
was
not
without
*NL*
satisfaction
that
Mrs.
Casaubon
should
have
an
opportunity
of
studying
*NL*
_
her
_
.
What
is
the
use
of
being
exquisite
if
you
are
not
seen
by
the
*NL*
best
judges
?
and
since
Rosamond
had
received
the
highest
compliments
at
*NL*
Sir
Godwin
Lydgate
's
,
she
felt
quite
confident
of
the
impression
she
*NL*
must
make
on
people
of
good
birth
.
Dorothea
put
out
her
hand
with
her
*NL*
usual
simple
kindness
,
and
looked
admiringly
at
Lydgate
's
lovely
*NL*
bride
--
aware
that
there
was
a
gentleman
standing
at
a
distance
,
but
*NL*
seeing
him
merely
as
a
coated
figure
at
a
wide
angle
.
The
gentleman
*NL*
was
too
much
occupied
with
the
presence
of
the
one
woman
to
reflect
on
*NL*
the
contrast
between
the
two
--
a
contrast
that
would
certainly
have
been
*NL*
striking
to
a
calm
observer
.
They
were
both
tall
,
and
their
eyes
were
*NL*
on
a
level
;
but
imagine
Rosamond
's
infantine
blondness
and
wondrous
*NL*
crown
of
hair-plaits
,
with
her
pale-blue
dress
of
a
fit
and
fashion
so
*NL*
perfect
that
no
dressmaker
could
look
at
it
without
emotion
,
a
large
*NL*
embroidered
collar
which
it
was
to
be
hoped
all
beholders
would
know
*NL*
the
price
of
,
her
small
hands
duly
set
off
with
rings
,
and
that
*NL*
controlled
self-consciousness
of
manner
which
is
the
expensive
*NL*
substitute
for
simplicity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
very
much
for
allowing
me
to
interrupt
you
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
*NL*
immediately
.
``
I
am
anxious
to
see
Mr.
Lydgate
,
if
possible
,
before
I
*NL*
go
home
,
and
I
hoped
that
you
might
possibly
tell
me
where
I
could
find
*NL*
him
,
or
even
allow
me
to
wait
for
him
,
if
you
expect
him
soon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
at
the
New
Hospital
,
''
said
Rosamond
;
``
I
am
not
sure
how
soon
he
*NL*
will
come
home
.
But
I
can
send
for
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
let
me
go
and
fetch
him
?
''
said
Will
Ladislaw
,
coming
forward
.
*NL*
He
had
already
taken
up
his
hat
before
Dorothea
entered
.
She
colored
*NL*
with
surprise
,
but
put
out
her
hand
with
a
smile
of
unmistakable
*NL*
pleasure
,
saying
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
not
know
it
was
you
:
I
had
no
thought
of
seeing
you
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
I
go
to
the
Hospital
and
tell
Mr.
Lydgate
that
you
wish
to
see
*NL*
him
?
''
said
Will
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
be
quicker
to
send
the
carriage
for
him
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
``
if
*NL*
you
will
be
kind
enough
to
give
the
message
to
the
coachman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Will
was
moving
to
the
door
when
Dorothea
,
whose
mind
had
flashed
in
an
*NL*
instant
over
many
connected
memories
,
turned
quickly
and
said
,
``
I
will
*NL*
go
myself
,
thank
you
.
I
wish
to
lose
no
time
before
getting
home
*NL*
again
.
I
will
drive
to
the
Hospital
and
see
Mr.
Lydgate
there
.
Pray
*NL*
excuse
me
,
Mrs.
Lydgate
.
I
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
mind
was
evidently
arrested
by
some
sudden
thought
,
and
she
left
*NL*
the
room
hardly
conscious
of
what
was
immediately
around
her
--
hardly
*NL*
conscious
that
Will
opened
the
door
for
her
and
offered
her
his
arm
to
*NL*
lead
her
to
the
carriage
.
She
took
the
arm
but
said
nothing
.
Will
was
*NL*
feeling
rather
vexed
and
miserable
,
and
found
nothing
to
say
on
his
*NL*
side
.
He
handed
her
into
the
carriage
in
silence
,
they
said
good-by
,
*NL*
and
Dorothea
drove
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
five
minutes
'
drive
to
the
Hospital
she
had
time
for
some
*NL*
reflections
that
were
quite
new
to
her
.
Her
decision
to
go
,
and
her
*NL*
preoccupation
in
leaving
the
room
,
had
come
from
the
sudden
sense
that
*NL*
there
would
be
a
sort
of
deception
in
her
voluntarily
allowing
any
*NL*
further
intercourse
between
herself
and
Will
which
she
was
unable
to
*NL*
mention
to
her
husband
,
and
already
her
errand
in
seeking
Lydgate
was
a
*NL*
matter
of
concealment
.
That
was
all
that
had
been
explicitly
in
her
*NL*
mind
;
but
she
had
been
urged
also
by
a
vague
discomfort
.
Now
that
she
*NL*
was
alone
in
her
drive
,
she
heard
the
notes
of
the
man
's
voice
and
the
*NL*
accompanying
piano
,
which
she
had
not
noted
much
at
the
time
,
returning
*NL*
on
her
inward
sense
;
and
she
found
herself
thinking
with
some
wonder
*NL*
that
Will
Ladislaw
was
passing
his
time
with
Mrs.
Lydgate
in
her
*NL*
husband
's
absence
.
And
then
she
could
not
help
remembering
that
he
had
*NL*
passed
some
time
with
her
under
like
circumstances
,
so
why
should
there
*NL*
be
any
unfitness
in
the
fact
?
But
Will
was
Mr.
Casaubon
's
relative
,
*NL*
and
one
towards
whom
she
was
bound
to
show
kindness
.
Still
there
had
*NL*
been
signs
which
perhaps
she
ought
to
have
understood
as
implying
that
*NL*
Mr.
Casaubon
did
not
like
his
cousin
's
visits
during
his
own
absence
.
*NL*
``
Perhaps
I
have
been
mistaken
in
many
things
,
''
said
poor
Dorothea
to
*NL*
herself
,
while
the
tears
came
rolling
and
she
had
to
dry
them
quickly
.
*NL*
She
felt
confusedly
unhappy
,
and
the
image
of
Will
which
had
been
so
*NL*
clear
to
her
before
was
mysteriously
spoiled
.
But
the
carriage
stopped
*NL*
at
the
gate
of
the
Hospital
.
She
was
soon
walking
round
the
grass
*NL*
plots
with
Lydgate
,
and
her
feelings
recovered
the
strong
bent
which
*NL*
had
made
her
seek
for
this
interview
.
*NL*
*NL*
Will
Ladislaw
,
meanwhile
,
was
mortified
,
and
knew
the
reason
of
it
*NL*
clearly
enough
.
His
chances
of
meeting
Dorothea
were
rare
;
and
here
*NL*
for
the
first
time
there
had
come
a
chance
which
had
set
him
at
a
*NL*
disadvantage
.
It
was
not
only
,
as
it
had
been
hitherto
,
that
she
was
*NL*
not
supremely
occupied
with
him
,
but
that
she
had
seen
him
under
*NL*
circumstances
in
which
he
might
appear
not
to
be
supremely
occupied
*NL*
with
her
.
He
felt
thrust
to
a
new
distance
from
her
,
amongst
the
*NL*
circles
of
Middlemarchers
who
made
no
part
of
her
life
.
But
that
was
*NL*
not
his
fault
:
of
course
,
since
he
had
taken
his
lodgings
in
the
town
,
*NL*
he
had
been
making
as
many
acquaintances
as
he
could
,
his
position
*NL*
requiring
that
he
should
know
everybody
and
everything
.
Lydgate
was
*NL*
really
better
worth
knowing
than
any
one
else
in
the
neighborhood
,
and
*NL*
he
happened
to
have
a
wife
who
was
musical
and
altogether
worth
calling
*NL*
upon
.
Here
was
the
whole
history
of
the
situation
in
which
Diana
had
*NL*
descended
too
unexpectedly
on
her
worshipper
.
It
was
mortifying
.
Will
*NL*
was
conscious
that
he
should
not
have
been
at
Middlemarch
but
for
*NL*
Dorothea
;
and
yet
his
position
there
was
threatening
to
divide
him
from
*NL*
her
with
those
barriers
of
habitual
sentiment
which
are
more
fatal
to
*NL*
the
persistence
of
mutual
interest
than
all
the
distance
between
Rome
*NL*
and
Britain
.
Prejudices
about
rank
and
status
were
easy
enough
to
defy
*NL*
in
the
form
of
a
tyrannical
letter
from
Mr.
Casaubon
;
but
prejudices
,
*NL*
like
odorous
bodies
,
have
a
double
existence
both
solid
and
subtle
--
solid
*NL*
as
the
pyramids
,
subtle
as
the
twentieth
echo
of
an
echo
,
or
as
*NL*
the
memory
of
hyacinths
which
once
scented
the
darkness
.
And
Will
was
*NL*
of
a
temperament
to
feel
keenly
the
presence
of
subtleties
:
a
man
of
*NL*
clumsier
perceptions
would
not
have
felt
,
as
he
did
,
that
for
the
first
*NL*
time
some
sense
of
unfitness
in
perfect
freedom
with
him
had
sprung
up
*NL*
in
Dorothea
's
mind
,
and
that
their
silence
,
as
he
conducted
her
to
the
*NL*
carriage
,
had
had
a
chill
in
it
.
Perhaps
Casaubon
,
in
his
hatred
and
*NL*
jealousy
,
had
been
insisting
to
Dorothea
that
Will
had
slid
below
her
*NL*
socially
.
Confound
Casaubon
!
*NL*
*NL*
Will
re-entered
the
drawing-room
,
took
up
his
hat
,
and
looking
*NL*
irritated
as
he
advanced
towards
Mrs.
Lydgate
,
who
had
seated
herself
*NL*
at
her
work-table
,
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
always
fatal
to
have
music
or
poetry
interrupted
.
May
I
come
*NL*
another
day
and
just
finish
about
the
rendering
of
`
Lungi
dal
caro
*NL*
bene
'
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
be
happy
to
be
taught
,
''
said
Rosamond
.
``
But
I
am
sure
you
*NL*
admit
that
the
interruption
was
a
very
beautiful
one
.
I
quite
envy
*NL*
your
acquaintance
with
Mrs.
Casaubon
.
Is
she
very
clever
?
She
looks
*NL*
as
if
she
were
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
,
I
never
thought
about
it
,
''
said
Will
,
sulkily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
just
the
answer
Tertius
gave
me
,
when
I
first
asked
him
if
she
*NL*
were
handsome
.
What
is
it
that
you
gentlemen
are
thinking
of
when
you
*NL*
are
with
Mrs.
Casaubon

not

to
provoke
the
charming
Mrs.

When

never

*NL*
``

nothing
of

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
does
not
seem
to
have
been
the
effect

them
to
be
compared
with

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

said
Will

almost
pettishly
.
``
Worship
is
usually
a

I
am
practising
it

at

*NL*
When
her

was
at
home
again

Rosamond
said
,
standing
in

of

him

holding
his
coat-collar
with
both
her
hands

``
Mr.

was

here

you

disliked

Surely
your

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

no

of
gypsy

he
thinks
nothing

*NL*
*NL*
``
Music

*NL*
``
Yes

Mrs.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
devil

said
Lydgate
,
smiling
and
pinching
his
wife
's
ears
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rosamond
felt
herself
beginning
to
know
a
great
deal
of
the
world
,
*NL*
especially
in
discovering
what
when
she
was
in
her
unmarried
girlhood
*NL*
had
been
inconceivable
to
her
except
as
a
dim
tragedy
in
by-gone
*NL*
costumes
--
that
women
,
even
after
marriage
,
might
make
conquests
and
*NL*
enslave
men
.
At
that
time
young
ladies
in
the
country
,
even
when
*NL*
educated
at
Mrs.
Lemon
's
,
read
little
French
literature
later
than
*NL*
Racine
,
and
public
prints
had
not
cast
their
present
magnificent
*NL*
illumination
over
the
scandals
of
life
.
Still
,
vanity
,
with
a
woman
's
*NL*
whole
mind
and
day
to
work
in
,
can
construct
abundantly
on
slight
*NL*
hints
,
especially
on
such
a
hint
as
the
possibility
of
indefinite
*NL*
conquests
.
How
delightful
to
make
captives
from
the
throne
of
marriage
*NL*
with
a
husband
as
crown-prince
by
your
side
--
himself
in
fact
a
*NL*
subject
--
while
the
captives
look
up
forever
hopeless
,
losing
their
*NL*
rest
probably
,
and
if
their
appetite
too
,
so
much
the
better
!
But
*NL*
Rosamond
's
romance
turned
at
present
chiefly
on
her
crown-prince
,
and
*NL*
it
was
enough
to
enjoy
his
assured
subjection
.
When
he
said
,
``
Poor
*NL*
devil
!
''
she
asked
,
with
playful
curiosity
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

what
can
a

do

neglects

runs
up

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

letting
his

looking
at

CHAPTER
XLIV
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
would
not
creep
along
the
coast
but
steer
*NL*
Out
in
mid-sea
,
by
guidance
of
the
stars
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
Dorothea
,
walking
round
the
laurel-planted
plots
of
the
New
*NL*
Hospital
with
Lydgate
,
had
learned
from
him
that
there
were
no
signs
of
*NL*
change
in
Mr.
Casaubon
's
bodily
condition
beyond
the
mental
sign
of
*NL*
anxiety
to
know
the
truth
about
his
illness
,
she
was
silent
for
a
few
*NL*
moments
,
wondering
whether
she
had
said
or
done
anything
to
rouse
this
*NL*
new
anxiety
.
Lydgate
,
not
willing
to
let
slip
an
opportunity
of
*NL*
furthering
a
favorite
purpose
,
ventured
to
say
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
whether
your
or
Mr.
--
Casaubon
's
attention
has
been
drawn
*NL*
to
the
needs
of
our
New
Hospital
.
Circumstances
have
made
it
seem
*NL*
rather
egotistic
in
me
to
urge
the
subject
;
but
that
is
not
my
fault
:
*NL*
it
is
because
there
is
a
fight
being
made
against
it
by
the
other
*NL*
medical
men
.
I
think
you
are
generally
interested
in
such
things
,
for
*NL*
I
remember
that
when
I
first
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
at
Tipton
*NL*
Grange
before
your
marriage
,
you
were
asking
me
some
questions
about
*NL*
the
way
in
which
the
health
of
the
poor
was
affected
by
their
miserable
*NL*
housing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
indeed
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
brightening
.
``
I
shall
be
quite
grateful
*NL*
to
you
if
you
will
tell
me
how
I
can
help
to
make
things
a
little
*NL*
better
.
Everything
of
that
sort
has
slipped
away
from
me
since
I
have
*NL*
been
married
.
I
mean
,
''
she
said
,
after
a
moment
's
hesitation
,
``
that
*NL*
the
people
in
our
village
are
tolerably
comfortable
,
and
my
mind
has
*NL*
been
too
much
taken
up
for
me
to
inquire
further
.
But
here
--
in
such
a
*NL*
place
as
Middlemarch
--
there
must
be
a
great
deal
to
be
done
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
everything
to
be
done
,
''
said
Lydgate
,
with
abrupt
energy
.
*NL*
``
And
this
Hospital
is
a
capital
piece
of
work
,
due
entirely
to
Mr.
*NL*
Bulstrode
's
exertions
,
and
in
a
great
degree
to
his
money
.
But
one
man
*NL*
ca
n't
do
everything
in
a
scheme
of
this
sort
.
Of
course
he
looked
*NL*
forward
to
help
.
And
now
there
's
a
mean
,
petty
feud
set
up
against
the
*NL*
thing
in
the
town
,
by
certain
persons
who
want
to
make
it
a
failure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
can
be
their
reasons
?
''
said
Dorothea
,
with
naive
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Chiefly
Mr.
Bulstrode
's
unpopularity
,
to
begin
with
.
Half
the
town
*NL*
would
almost
take
trouble
for
the
sake
of
thwarting
him
.
In
this
*NL*
stupid
world
most
people
never
consider
that
a
thing
is
good
to
be
done
*NL*
unless
it
is
done
by
their
own
set
.
I
had
no
connection
with
Bulstrode
*NL*
before
I
came
here
.
I
look
at
him
quite
impartially
,
and
I
see
that
he
*NL*
has
some
notions
--
that
he
has
set
things
on
foot
--
which
I
can
turn
to
*NL*
good
public
purpose
.
If
a
fair
number
of
the
better
educated
men
went
*NL*
to
work
with
the
belief
that
their
observations
might
contribute
to
the
*NL*
reform
of
medical
doctrine
and
practice
,
we
should
soon
see
a
change
*NL*
for
the
better
.
That
's
my
point
of
view
.
I
hold
that
by
refusing
to
*NL*
work
with
Mr.
Bulstrode
I
should
be
turning
my
back
on
an
opportunity
*NL*
of
making
my
profession
more
generally
serviceable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
quite
agree
with
you
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
at
once
fascinated
by
the
*NL*
situation
sketched
in
Lydgate
's
words
.
``
But
what
is
there
against
Mr.
*NL*
Bulstrode
?
I
know
that
my
uncle
is
friendly
with
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
People
do
n't
like
his
religious
tone
,
''
said
Lydgate
,
breaking
off
*NL*
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
all
the
stronger
reason
for
despising
such
an
opposition
,
''
*NL*
said
Dorothea
,
looking
at
the
affairs
of
Middlemarch
by
the
light
of
*NL*
the
great
persecutions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
put
the
matter
quite
fairly
,
they
have
other
objections
to
him
:
--
he
*NL*
is
masterful
and
rather
unsociable
,
and
he
is
concerned
with
trade
,
*NL*
which
has
complaints
of
its
own
that
I
know
nothing
about
.
But
what
*NL*
has
that
to
do
with
the
question
whether
it
would
not
be
a
fine
thing
*NL*
to
establish
here
a
more
valuable
hospital
than
any
they
have
in
the
*NL*
county
?
The
immediate
motive
to
the
opposition
,
however
,
is
the
fact
*NL*
that
Bulstrode
has
put
the
medical
direction
into
my
hands
.
Of
course
*NL*
I
am
glad
of
that
.
It
gives
me
an
opportunity
of
doing
some
good
*NL*
work
,
--
and
I
am
aware
that
I
have
to
justify
his
choice
of
me
.
But
the
*NL*
consequence
is
,
that
the
whole
profession
in
Middlemarch
have
set
*NL*
themselves
tooth
and
nail
against
the
Hospital
,
and
not
only
refuse
to
*NL*
cooperate
themselves
,
but
try
to
blacken
the
whole
affair
and
hinder
*NL*
subscriptions
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
very
petty
!
''
exclaimed
Dorothea
,
indignantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
one
must
expect
to
fight
one
's
way
:
there
is
hardly
anything
*NL*
to
be
done
without
it
.
And
the
ignorance
of
people
about
here
is
*NL*
stupendous
.
I
do
n't
lay
claim
to
anything
else
than
having
used
some
*NL*
opportunities
which
have
not
come
within
everybody
's
reach
;
but
there
*NL*
is
no
stifling
the
offence
of
being
young
,
and
a
new-comer
,
and
*NL*
happening
to
know
something
more
than
the
old
inhabitants
.
Still
,
if
I
*NL*
believe
that
I
can
set
going
a
better
method
of
treatment
--
if
I
*NL*
believe
that
I
can
pursue
certain
observations
and
inquiries
which
may
*NL*
be
a
lasting
benefit
to
medical
practice
,
I
should
be
a
base
truckler
*NL*
if
I
allowed
any
consideration
of
personal
comfort
to
hinder
me
.
And
*NL*
the
course
is
all
the
clearer
from
there
being
no
salary
in
question
to
*NL*
put
my
persistence
in
an
equivocal
light
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
glad
you
have
told
me
this
,
Mr.
Lydgate
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
*NL*
cordially
.
``
I
feel
sure
I
can
help
a
little
.
I
have
some
money
,
and
*NL*
do
n't
know
what
to
do
with
it
--
that
is
often
an
uncomfortable
thought
*NL*
to
me
.
I
am
sure
I
can
spare
two
hundred
a-year
for
a
grand
purpose
*NL*
like
this
.
How
happy
you
must
be
,
to
know
things
that
you
feel
sure
*NL*
will
do
great
good
!
I
wish
I
could
awake
with
that
knowledge
every
*NL*
morning
.
There
seems
to
be
so
much
trouble
taken
that
one
can
hardly
*NL*
see
the
good
of
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
melancholy
cadence
in
Dorothea
's
voice
as
she
spoke
these
*NL*
last
words
.
But
she
presently
added
,
more
cheerfully
,
``
Pray
come
to
*NL*
Lowick
and
tell
us
more
of
this
.
I
will
mention
the
subject
to
Mr.
*NL*
Casaubon
.
I
must
hasten
home
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
mention
it
that
evening
,
and
said
that
she
should
like
to
*NL*
subscribe
two
hundred
a-year
--
she
had
seven
hundred
a-year
as
the
*NL*
equivalent
of
her
own
fortune
,
settled
on
her
at
her
marriage
.
Mr.
*NL*
Casaubon
made
no
objection
beyond
a
passing
remark
that
the
sum
might
*NL*
be
disproportionate
in
relation
to
other
good
objects
,
but
when
*NL*
Dorothea
in
her
ignorance
resisted
that
suggestion
,
he
acquiesced
.
He
*NL*
did
not
care
himself
about
spending
money
,
and
was
not
reluctant
to
*NL*
give
it
.
If
he
ever
felt
keenly
any
question
of
money
it
was
through
*NL*
the
medium
of
another
passion
than
the
love
of
material
property
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
told
him
that
she
had
seen
Lydgate
,
and
recited
the
gist
of
*NL*
her
conversation
with
him
about
the
Hospital
.
Mr.
Casaubon
did
not
*NL*
question
her
further
,
but
he
felt
sure
that
she
had
wished
to
know
what
*NL*
had
passed
between
Lydgate
and
himself
``
She
knows

said

the
ever-restless
voice
within
;
but
that
increase
of
tacit
knowledge
*NL*
only
thrust
further
off
any
confidence
between
them

He
distrusted
her

affection

what
loneliness
is
more
lonely
than
distrust

CHAPTER
XLV
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
the
humor
of
many
heads
to
extol
the
days
of
their
*NL*
forefathers
,
and
declaim
against
the
wickedness
of
times
*NL*
present
.
Which
notwithstanding
they
can
not
handsomely
do
,
*NL*
without
the
borrowed
help
and
satire
of
times
past
;
*NL*
condemning
the
vices
of
their
own
times
,
by
the
expressions
*NL*
of
vices
in
times
which
they
commend
,
which
can
not
but
argue
*NL*
the
community
of
vice
in
both
.
Horace
,
therefore
,
Juvenal
,
*NL*
and
Persius
,
were
no
prophets
,
although
their
lines
did
seem
*NL*
to
indigitate
and
point
at
our
times
.
--
SIR
THOMAS
BROWNE
:
*NL*
Pseudodoxia
Epidemica
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
That
opposition
to
the
New
Fever
Hospital
which
Lydgate
had
sketched
to
*NL*
Dorothea
was
,
like
other
oppositions
,
to
be
viewed
in
many
different
*NL*
lights
.
He
regarded
it
as
a
mixture
of
jealousy
and
dunderheaded
*NL*
prejudice
.
Mr.
Bulstrode
saw
in
it
not
only
medical
jealousy
but
a
*NL*
determination
to
thwart
himself
,
prompted
mainly
by
a
hatred
of
that
*NL*
vital
religion
of
which
he
had
striven
to
be
an
effectual
lay
*NL*
representative
--
a
hatred
which
certainly
found
pretexts
apart
from
*NL*
religion
such
as
were
only
too
easy
to
find
in
the
entanglements
of
*NL*
human
action
.
These
might
be
called
the
ministerial
views
.
But
*NL*
oppositions
have
the
illimitable
range
of
objections
at
command
,
which
*NL*
need
never
stop
short
at
the
boundary
of
knowledge
,
but
can
draw
*NL*
forever
on
the
vasts
of
ignorance
.
What
the
opposition
in
Middlemarch
*NL*
said
about
the
New
Hospital
and
its
administration
had
certainly
a
*NL*
great
deal
of
echo
in
it
,
for
heaven
has
taken
care
that
everybody
*NL*
shall
not
be
an
originator
;
but
there
were
differences
which
*NL*
represented
every
social
shade
between
the
polished
moderation
of
Dr.
*NL*
Minchin
and
the
trenchant
assertion
of
Mrs.
Dollop
,
the
landlady
of
the
*NL*
Tankard
in
Slaughter
Lane
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Dollop
became
more
and
more
convinced
by
her
own
asseveration
,
*NL*
that
Dr.
Lydgate
meant
to
let
the
people
die
in
the
Hospital
,
if
not
to
*NL*
poison
them
,
for
the
sake
of
cutting
them
up
without
saying
by
your
*NL*
leave
or
with
your
leave
;
for
it
was
a
known
``
fac
''
that
he
had
wanted
*NL*
to
cut
up
Mrs.
Goby
,
as
respectable
a
woman
as
any
in
Parley
Street
,
*NL*
who
had
money
in
trust
before
her
marriage
--
a
poor
tale
for
a
doctor
,
*NL*
who
if
he
was
good
for
anything
should
know
what
was
the
matter
with
*NL*
you
before
you
died
,
and
not
want
to
pry
into
your
inside
after
you
*NL*
were
gone
.
If
that
was
not
reason
,
Mrs.
Dollop
wished
to
know
what
*NL*
was
;
but
there
was
a
prevalent
feeling
in
her
audience
that
her
opinion
*NL*
was
a
bulwark
,
and
that
if
it
were
overthrown
there
would
be
no
limits
*NL*
to
the
cutting-up
of
bodies
,
as
had
been
well
seen
in
Burke
and
Hare
*NL*
with
their
pitch-plaisters
--
such
a
hanging
business
as
that
was
not
*NL*
wanted
in
Middlemarch
!
*NL*
*NL*
And
let
it
not
be
supposed
that
opinion
at
the
Tankard
in
Slaughter
*NL*
Lane
was
unimportant
to
the
medical
profession
:
that
old
authentic
*NL*
public-house
--
the
original
Tankard
,
known
by
the
name
of
Dollop
's
--
was
*NL*
the
resort
of
a
great
Benefit
Club
,
which
had
some
months
before
put
to
*NL*
the
vote
whether
its
long-standing
medical
man
,
``
Doctor
Gambit
,
''
should
*NL*
not
be
cashiered
in
favor
of
``
this
Doctor
Lydgate
,
''
who
was
capable
of
*NL*
performing
the
most
astonishing
cures
,
and
rescuing
people
altogether
*NL*
given
up
by
other
practitioners
.
But
the
balance
had
been
turned
*NL*
against
Lydgate
by
two
members
,
who
for
some
private
reasons
held
that
*NL*
this
power
of
resuscitating
persons
as
good
as
dead
was
an
equivocal
*NL*
recommendation
,
and
might
interfere
with
providential
favors
.
In
the
*NL*
course
of
the
year
,
however
,
there
had
been
a
change
in
the
public
*NL*
sentiment
,
of
which
the
unanimity
at
Dollop
's
was
an
index
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
good
deal
more
than
a
year
ago
,
before
anything
was
known
of
*NL*
Lydgate
's
skill
,
the
judgments
on
it
had
naturally
been
divided
,
*NL*
depending
on
a
sense
of
likelihood
,
situated
perhaps
in
the
pit
of
the
*NL*
stomach
or
in
the
pineal
gland
,
and
differing
in
its
verdicts
,
but
not
*NL*
the
less
valuable
as
a
guide
in
the
total
deficit
of
evidence
.
*NL*
Patients
who
had
chronic
diseases
or
whose
lives
had
long
been
worn
*NL*
threadbare
,
like
old
Featherstone
's
,
had
been
at
once
inclined
to
try
*NL*
him
;
also
,
many
who
did
not
like
paying
their
doctor
's
bills
,
thought
*NL*
agreeably
of
opening
an
account
with
a
new
doctor
and
sending
for
him
*NL*
without
stint
if
the
children
's
temper
wanted
a
dose
,
occasions
when
*NL*
the
old
practitioners
were
often
crusty
;
and
all
persons
thus
inclined
*NL*
to
employ
Lydgate
held
it
likely
that
he
was
clever
.
Some
considered
*NL*
that
he
might
do
more
than
others
``
where
there
was
liver
;
''
--
at
least
*NL*
there
would
be
no
harm
in
getting
a
few
bottles
of
``
stuff
''
from
him
,
*NL*
since
if
these
proved
useless
it
would
still
be
possible
to
return
to
*NL*
the
Purifying
Pills
,
which
kept
you
alive
if
they
did
not
remove
the
*NL*
yellowness
.
But
these
were
people
of
minor
importance
.
Good
*NL*
Middlemarch
families
were
of
course
not
going
to
change
their
doctor
*NL*
without
reason
shown
;
and
everybody
who
had
employed
Mr.
Peacock
did
*NL*
not
feel
obliged
to
accept
a
new
man
merely
in
the
character
of
his
*NL*
successor
,
objecting
that
he
was
``
not
likely
to
be
equal
to
Peacock
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Lydgate
had
not
been
long
in
the
town
before
there
were
particulars
*NL*
enough
reported
of
him
to
breed
much
more
specific
expectations
and
to
*NL*
intensify
differences
into
partisanship
;
some
of
the
particulars
being
*NL*
of
that
impressive
order
of
which
the
significance
is
entirely
hidden
,
*NL*
like
a
statistical
amount
without
a
standard
of
comparison
,
but
with
a
*NL*
note
of
exclamation
at
the
end
.
The
cubic
feet
of
oxygen
yearly
*NL*
swallowed
by
a
full-grown
man
--
what
a
shudder
they
might
have
created
*NL*
in
some
Middlemarch
circles
!
``
Oxygen
!
nobody
knows
what
that
may
*NL*
be
--
is
it
any
wonder
the
cholera
has
got
to
Dantzic
?
And
yet
there
are
*NL*
people
who
say
quarantine
is
no
good
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
the
facts
quickly
rumored
was
that
Lydgate
did
not
dispense
*NL*
drugs
.
This
was
offensive
both
to
the
physicians
whose
exclusive
*NL*
distinction
seemed
infringed
on
,
and
to
the
surgeon-apothecaries
with
*NL*
whom
he
ranged
himself
;
and
only
a
little
while
before
,
they
might
have
*NL*
counted
on
having
the
law
on
their
side
against
a
man
who
without
*NL*
calling
himself
a
London-made
M.D.
dared
to
ask
for
pay
except
as
a
*NL*
charge
on
drugs
.
But
Lydgate
had
not
been
experienced
enough
to
*NL*
foresee
that
his
new
course
would
be
even
more
offensive
to
the
laity
;
*NL*
and
to
Mr.
Mawmsey
,
an
important
grocer
in
the
Top
Market
,
who
,
though
*NL*
not
one
of
his
patients
,
questioned
him
in
an
affable
manner
on
the
*NL*
subject
,
he
was
injudicious
enough
to
give
a
hasty
popular
explanation
*NL*
of
his
reasons
,
pointing
out
to
Mr.
Mawmsey
that
it
must
lower
the
*NL*
character
of
practitioners
,
and
be
a
constant
injury
to
the
public
,
if
*NL*
their
only
mode
of
getting
paid
for
their
work
was
by
their
making
out
*NL*
long
bills
for
draughts
,
boluses
,
and
mixtures
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
in
that
way
that
hard-working
medical
men
may
come
to
be
almost
*NL*
as
mischievous
as
quacks
,
''
said
Lydgate
,
rather
thoughtlessly
.
``
To
get
*NL*
their
own
bread
they
must
overdose
the
king
's
lieges
;
and
that
's
a
bad
*NL*
sort
of
treason
,
Mr.
Mawmsey
--
undermines
the
constitution
in
a
fatal
*NL*
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Mawmsey
was
not
only
an
overseer
-LRB-
it
was
about
a
question
of
*NL*
outdoor
pay
that
he
was
having
an
interview
with
Lydgate
-RRB-
,
he
was
also
*NL*
asthmatic
and
had
an
increasing
family
:
thus
,
from
a
medical
point
of
*NL*
view
,
as
well
as
from
his
own
,
he
was
an
important
man
;
indeed
,
an
*NL*
exceptional
grocer
,
whose
hair
was
arranged
in
a
flame-like
pyramid
,
*NL*
and
whose
retail
deference
was
of
the
cordial
,
encouraging
*NL*
kind
--
jocosely
complimentary
,
and
with
a
certain
considerate
abstinence
*NL*
from
letting
out
the
full
force
of
his
mind
.
It
was
Mr.
Mawmsey
's
*NL*
friendly
jocoseness
in
questioning
him
which
had
set
the
tone
of
*NL*
Lydgate
's
reply
.
But
let
the
wise
be
warned
against
too
great
*NL*
readiness
at
explanation
:
it
multiplies
the
sources
of
mistake
,
*NL*
lengthening
the
sum
for
reckoners
sure
to
go
wrong
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lydgate
smiled
as
he
ended
his
speech
,
putting
his
foot
into
the
*NL*
stirrup
,
and
Mr.
Mawmsey
laughed
more
than
he
would
have
done
if
he
had
*NL*
known
who
the
king
's
lieges
were
,
giving
his
``
Good
morning
,
sir
,
*NL*
good-morning
,
sir
,
''
with
the
air
of
one
who
saw
everything
clearly
*NL*
enough
.
But
in
truth
his
views
were
perturbed
.
For
years
he
had
been
*NL*
paying
bills
with
strictly
made
items
,
so
that
for
every
half-crown
and
*NL*
eighteen-pence
he
was
certain
something
measurable
had
been
delivered
.
*NL*
He
had
done
this
with
satisfaction
,
including
it
among
his
*NL*
responsibilities
as
a
husband
and
father
,
and
regarding
a
longer
bill
*NL*
than
usual
as
a
dignity
worth
mentioning
.
Moreover
,
in
addition
to
the
*NL*
massive
benefit
of
the
drugs
to
``
self
and
family
,
''
he
had
enjoyed
the
*NL*
pleasure
of
forming
an
acute
judgment
as
to
their
immediate
effects
,
so
*NL*
as
to
give
an
intelligent
statement
for
the
guidance
of
Mr.
Gambit
--
a
*NL*
practitioner
just
a
little
lower
in
status
than
Wrench
or
Toller
,
and
*NL*
especially
esteemed
as
an
accoucheur
,
of
whose
ability
Mr.
Mawmsey
had
*NL*
the
poorest
opinion
on
all
other
points
,
but
in
doctoring
,
he
was
wont
*NL*
to
say
in
an
undertone
,
he
placed
Gambit
above
any
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
were
deeper
reasons
than
the
superficial
talk
of
a
new
man
,
which
*NL*
appeared
still
flimsier
in
the
drawing-room
over
the
shop
,
when
they
*NL*
were
recited
to
Mrs.
Mawmsey
,
a
woman
accustomed
to
be
made
much
of
as
*NL*
a
fertile
mother
,
--
generally
under
attendance
more
or
less
frequent
*NL*
from
Mr.
Gambit
,
and
occasionally
having
attacks
which
required
Dr.
*NL*
Minchin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
this
Mr.
Lydgate
mean
to
say
there
is
no
use
in
taking
medicine
?
''
*NL*
said
Mrs.
Mawmsey
,
who
was
slightly
given
to
drawling
.
``
I
should
like
*NL*
him
to
tell
me
how
I
could
bear
up
at
Fair
time
,
if
I
did
n't
take
*NL*
strengthening
medicine
for
a
month
beforehand
.
Think
of
what
I
have
to
*NL*
provide
for
calling
customers
,
my
dear
!
''
--
here
Mrs.
Mawmsey
turned
to
*NL*
an
intimate
female
friend
who
sat
by
--
``
a
large
veal
pie
--
a
stuffed
*NL*
fillet
--
a
round
of
beef
--
ham
,
tongue
,
et
cetera
,
et
cetera
!
But
what
*NL*
keeps
me
up
best
is
the
pink
mixture
,
not
the
brown
.
I
wonder
,
Mr.
*NL*
Mawmsey
,
with
_
your
_
experience
,
you
could
have
patience
to
listen
.
I
*NL*
should
have
told
him
at
once
that
I
knew
a
little
better
than
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
no
,
''
said
Mr.
Mawmsey
;
``
I
was
not
going
to
tell
him
my
*NL*
opinion
.
Hear
everything
and
judge
for
yourself
is
my
motto
.
But
he
*NL*
did
n't
know
who
he
was
talking
to
.
I
was
not
to
be
turned
on
_
his
_
*NL*
finger
.
People
often
pretend
to
tell
me
things
,
when
they
might
as
*NL*
well
say
,
`
Mawmsey
,
you
're
a
fool
.
'
But
I
smile
at
it
:
I
humor
*NL*
everybody
's
weak
place
.
If
physic
had
done
harm
to
self
and
family
,
I
*NL*
should
have
found
it
out
by
this
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
Mr.
Gambit
was
told
that
Lydgate
went
about
saying
physic
*NL*
was
of
no
use
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
!
''
said
he
,
lifting
his
eyebrows
with
cautious
surprise
.
-LRB-
He
*NL*
was
a
stout
husky
man
with
a
large
ring
on
his
fourth
finger
.
-RRB-
``
How
*NL*
will
he
cure
his
patients
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
what
I
say
,
''
returned
Mrs.
Mawmsey
,
who
habitually
gave
weight
*NL*
to
her
speech
by
loading
her
pronouns
.
``
Does
_
he
_
suppose
that
people
*NL*
will
pay
him
only
to
come
and
sit
with
them
and
go
away
again
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Mawmsey
had
had
a
great
deal
of
sitting
from
Mr.
Gambit
,
including
*NL*
very
full
accounts
of
his
own
habits
of
body
and
other
affairs
;
but
of
*NL*
course
he
knew
there
was
no
innuendo
in
her
remark
,
since
his
spare
*NL*
time
and
personal
narrative
had
never
been
charged
for
.
So
he
replied
,
*NL*
humorously
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Lydgate
is
a
good-looking
young
fellow
,
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
one
that
I
would
employ

said
Mrs.
Mawmsey
.
''
_
Others

''
*NL*
*NL*
Hence
Mr.
Gambit
could
go
away
from
the
chief
grocer
's
without
fear
of
*NL*
rivalry
,
but
not
without
a
sense
that
Lydgate
was
one
of
those
*NL*
hypocrites
who
try
to
discredit
others
by
advertising
their
own
*NL*
honesty
,
and
that
it
might
be
worth
some
people
's
while
to
show
him
up
.
*NL*
Mr.
Gambit
,
however
,
had
a
satisfactory
practice
,
much
pervaded
by
the
*NL*
smells
of
retail
trading
which
suggested
the
reduction
of
cash
payments
*NL*
to
a
balance
.
And
he
did
not
think
it
worth
his
while
to
show
Lydgate
*NL*
up
until
he
knew
how
.
He
had
not
indeed
great
resources
of
education
,
*NL*
and
had
had
to
work
his
own
way
against
a
good
deal
of
professional
*NL*
contempt
;
but
he
made
none
the
worse
accoucheur
for
calling
the
*NL*
breathing
apparatus
``
longs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Other
medical
men
felt
themselves
more
capable
.
Mr.
Toller
shared
the
*NL*
highest
practice
in
the
town
and
belonged
to
an
old
Middlemarch
family
:
*NL*
there
were
Tollers
in
the
law
and
everything
else
above
the
line
of
*NL*
retail
trade
.
Unlike
our
irascible
friend
Wrench
,
he
had
the
easiest
*NL*
way
in
the
world
of
taking
things
which
might
be
supposed
to
annoy
him
,
*NL*
being
a
well-bred
,
quietly
facetious
man
,
who
kept
a
good
house
,
was
*NL*
very
fond
of
a
little
sporting
when
he
could
get
it
,
very
friendly
with
*NL*
Mr.
Hawley
,
and
hostile
to
Mr.
Bulstrode
.
It
may
seem
odd
that
with
*NL*
such
pleasant
habits
he
should
have
been
given
to
the
heroic
treatment
,
*NL*
bleeding
and
blistering
and
starving
his
patients
,
with
a
dispassionate
*NL*
disregard
to
his
personal
example
;
but
the
incongruity
favored
the
*NL*
opinion
of
his
ability
among
his
patients
,
who
commonly
observed
that
*NL*
Mr.
Toller
had
lazy
manners
,
but
his
treatment
was
as
active
as
you
*NL*
could
desire
:
no
man
,
said
they
,
carried
more
seriousness
into
his
*NL*
profession
:
he
was
a
little
slow
in
coming
,
but
when
he
came
,
he
_
did
_
*NL*
something
.
He
was
a
great
favorite
in
his
own
circle
,
and
whatever
he
*NL*
implied
to
any
one
's
disadvantage
told
doubly
from
his
careless
*NL*
ironical
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
naturally
got
tired
of
smiling
and
saying
,
``
Ah
!
''
when
he
was
told
*NL*
that
Mr.
Peacock
's
successor
did
not
mean
to
dispense
medicines
;
and
*NL*
Mr.
Hackbutt
one
day
mentioning
it
over
the
wine
at
a
dinner-party
,
Mr.
*NL*
Toller
said
,
laughingly
,
``
Dibbitts
will
get
rid
of
his
stale
drugs
,
*NL*
then
.
I
'm
fond
of
little
Dibbitts
--
I
'm
glad
he
's
in
luck
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
your
meaning
,
Toller
,
''
said
Mr.
Hackbutt
,
``
and
I
am
entirely
of
*NL*
your
opinion
.
I
shall
take
an
opportunity
of
expressing
myself
to
that
*NL*
effect
.
A
medical
man
should
be
responsible
for
the
quality
of
the
*NL*
drugs
consumed
by
his
patients
.
That
is
the
rationale
of
the
system
of
*NL*
charging
which
has
hitherto
obtained
;
and
nothing
is
more
offensive
*NL*
than
this
ostentation
of
reform
,
where
there
is
no
real
amelioration
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ostentation
,
Hackbutt
?
''
said
Mr.
Toller
,
ironically
.
``
I
do
n't
see
*NL*
that
.
A
man
ca
n't
very
well
be
ostentatious
of
what
nobody
believes
*NL*
in
.
There
's
no
reform
in
the
matter
:
the
question
is
,
whether
the
*NL*
profit
on
the
drugs
is
paid
to
the
medical
man
by
the
druggist
or
by
*NL*
the
patient
,
and
whether
there
shall
be
extra
pay
under
the
name
of
*NL*
attendance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
to
be
sure
;
one
of
your
damned
new
versions
of
old
humbug
,
''
said
*NL*
Mr.
Hawley
,
passing
the
decanter
to
Mr.
Wrench
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Wrench
,
generally
abstemious
,
often
drank
wine
rather
freely
at
a
*NL*
party
,
getting
the
more
irritable
in
consequence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
to
humbug
,
Hawley
,
''
he
said
,
``
that
's
a
word
easy
to
fling
about
.
*NL*
But
what
I
contend
against
is
the
way
medical
men
are
fouling
their
own
*NL*
nest
,
and
setting
up
a
cry
about
the
country
as
if
a
general
*NL*
practitioner
who
dispenses
drugs
could
n't
be
a
gentleman
.
I
throw
back
*NL*
the
imputation
with
scorn
.
I
say
,
the
most
ungentlemanly
trick
a
man
*NL*
can
be
guilty
of
is
to
come
among
the
members
of
his
profession
with
*NL*
innovations
which
are
a
libel
on
their
time-honored
procedure
.
That
is
*NL*
my
opinion
,
and
I
am
ready
to
maintain
it
against
any
one
who
*NL*
contradicts
me
.
''
Mr.
Wrench
's
voice
had
become
exceedingly
sharp
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
oblige
you
there
,
Wrench
,
''
said
Mr.
Hawley
,
thrusting
his
*NL*
hands
into
his
trouser-pockets
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
fellow
,
''
said
Mr.
Toller
,
striking
in
pacifically
,
and
looking
*NL*
at
Mr.
Wrench
,
``
the
physicians
have
their
toes
trodden
on
more
than

have

If
you
come

a
question
for
Minchin

Sprague

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
medical
jurisprudence
provide
nothing
against
these

said
Mr.
Hackbutt
,
with
a
disinterested
desire
to
offer
*NL*
his
lights
.
``
How
does
the

eh
,
Hawley
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing

''
said
Mr.

.
``
I

into

only
break
your

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pooh
!
no

''
said
Mr.
Toller
.
``
So
far
as
practice
is
*NL*
concerned
the
attempt
is
an
absurdity
.
No
patient
will
like
*NL*
it
--
certainly
not
Peacock
's
,
who
have
been
used
to
depletion
.
Pass
the
*NL*
wine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Toller
's
prediction
was
partly
verified
.
If
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Mawmsey
,
*NL*
who
had
no
idea
of
employing
Lydgate
,
were
made
uneasy
by
his
supposed
*NL*
declaration
against
drugs
,
it
was
inevitable
that
those
who
called
him
*NL*
in
should
watch
a
little
anxiously
to
see
whether
he
did
``
use
all
the
*NL*
means
he
might
use
''
in
the
case
.
Even
good
Mr.
Powderell
,
who
in
his
*NL*
constant
charity
of
interpretation
was
inclined
to
esteem
Lydgate
the
*NL*
more
for
what
seemed
a
conscientious
pursuit
of
a
better
plan
,
had
his
*NL*
mind
disturbed
with
doubts
during
his
wife
's
attack
of
erysipelas
,
and
*NL*
could
not
abstain
from
mentioning
to
Lydgate
that
Mr.
Peacock
on
a
*NL*
similar
occasion
had
administered
a
series
of
boluses
which
were
not
*NL*
otherwise
definable
than
by
their
remarkable
effect
in
bringing
Mrs.
*NL*
Powderell
round
before
Michaelmas
from
an
illness
which
had
begun
in
a
*NL*
remarkably
hot
August
.
At
last
,
indeed
,
in
the
conflict
between
his
*NL*
desire
not
to
hurt
Lydgate
and
his
anxiety
that
no
``
means
''
should
be
*NL*
lacking
,
he
induced
his
wife
privately
to
take
Widgeon
's
Purifying
*NL*
Pills
,
an
esteemed
Middlemarch
medicine
,
which
arrested
every
disease
*NL*
at
the
fountain
by
setting
to
work
at
once
upon
the
blood
.
This
*NL*
co-operative
measure
was
not
to
be
mentioned
to
Lydgate
,
and
Mr.
*NL*
Powderell
himself
had
no
certain
reliance
on
it
,
only
hoping
that
it
*NL*
might
be
attended
with
a
blessing
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
in
this
doubtful
stage
of
Lydgate
's
introduction
he
was
helped
by
*NL*
what
we
mortals
rashly
call
good
fortune
.
I
suppose
no
doctor
ever
*NL*
came
newly
to
a
place
without
making
cures
that
surprised
somebody
--
cures
*NL*
which
may
be
called
fortune
's
testimonials
,
and
deserve
as
much
*NL*
credit
as
the
written
or
printed
kind
.
Various
patients
got
well
while
*NL*
Lydgate
was
attending
them
,
some
even
of
dangerous
illnesses
;
and
it
*NL*
was
remarked
that
the
new
doctor
with
his
new
ways
had
at
least
the
*NL*
merit
of
bringing
people
back
from
the
brink
of
death
.
The
trash
*NL*
talked
on
such
occasions
was
the
more
vexatious
to
Lydgate
,
because
it
*NL*
gave
precisely
the
sort
of
prestige
which
an
incompetent
and
*NL*
unscrupulous
man
would
desire
,
and
was
sure
to
be
imputed
to
him
by
the
*NL*
simmering
dislike
of
the
other
medical
men
as
an
encouragement
on
his
*NL*
own
part
of
ignorant
puffing
.
But
even
his
proud
outspokenness
was
*NL*
checked
by
the
discernment
that
it
was
as
useless
to
fight
against
the
*NL*
interpretations
of
ignorance
as
to
whip
the
fog
;
and
``
good
fortune
''
*NL*
insisted
on
using
those
interpretations
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Larcher
having
just
become
charitably
concerned
about
alarming
*NL*
symptoms
in
her
charwoman
,
when
Dr.
Minchin
called
,
asked
him
to
see
*NL*
her
then
and
there
,
and
to
give
her
a
certificate
for
the
Infirmary
;
*NL*
whereupon
after
examination
he
wrote
a
statement
of
the
case
as
one
of
*NL*
tumor
,
and
recommended
the
bearer
Nancy
Nash
as
an
out-patient
.
Nancy
,
*NL*
calling
at
home
on
her
way
to
the
Infirmary
,
allowed
the
stay
maker
and
*NL*
his
wife
,
in
whose
attic
she
lodged
,
to
read
Dr.
Minchin
's
paper
,
and
*NL*
by
this
means
became
a
subject
of
compassionate
conversation
in
the
*NL*
neighboring
shops
of
Churchyard
Lane
as
being
afflicted
with
a
tumor
at
*NL*
first
declared
to
be
as
large
and
hard
as
a
duck
's
egg
,
but
later
in
*NL*
the
day
to
be
about
the
size
of
``
your
fist
.
''
Most
hearers
agreed
that
*NL*
it
would
have
to
be
cut
out
,
but
one
had
known
of
oil
and
another
of
*NL*
``
squitchineal
''
as
adequate
to
soften
and
reduce
any
lump
in
the
body
*NL*
when
taken
enough
of
into
the
inside
--
the
oil
by
gradually
``
soopling
,
''
*NL*
the
squitchineal
by
eating
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
when
Nancy
presented
herself
at
the
Infirmary
,
it
happened
to
*NL*
be
one
of
Lydgate
's
days
there
.
After
questioning
and
examining
her
,
*NL*
Lydgate
said
to
the
house-surgeon
in
an
undertone
,
``
It
's
not
tumor
:
*NL*
it
's
cramp
.
''
He
ordered
her
a
blister
and
some
steel
mixture
,
and
told
*NL*
her
to
go
home
and
rest
,
giving
her
at
the
same
time
a
note
to
Mrs.
*NL*
Larcher
,
who
,
she
said
,
was
her
best
employer
,
to
testify
that
she
was
*NL*
in
need
of
good
food
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
by-and-by
Nancy
,
in
her
attic
,
became
portentously
worse
,
the
*NL*
supposed
tumor
having
indeed
given
way
to
the
blister
,
but
only
*NL*
wandered
to
another
region
with
angrier
pain
.
The
staymaker
's
wife
*NL*
went
to
fetch
Lydgate
,
and
he
continued
for
a
fortnight
to
attend
Nancy
*NL*
in
her
own
home
,
until
under
his
treatment
she
got
quite
well
and
went
*NL*
to
work
again
.
But
the
case
continued
to
be
described
as
one
of
tumor
*NL*
in
Churchyard
Lane
and
other
streets
--
nay
,
by
Mrs.
Larcher
also
;
for
*NL*
when
Lydgate
's
remarkable
cure
was
mentioned
to
Dr.
Minchin
,
he
*NL*
naturally
did
not
like
to
say
,
``
The
case
was
not
one
of
tumor
,
and
I
*NL*
was
mistaken
in
describing
it
as
such
,
''
but
answered
,
``
Indeed
!
ah
!
I
*NL*
saw
it
was
a
surgical
case
,
not
of
a
fatal
kind
.
''
He
had
been
inwardly
*NL*
annoyed
,
however
,
when
he
had
asked
at
the
Infirmary
about
the
woman
he
*NL*
had
recommended
two
days
before
,
to
hear
from
the
house-surgeon
,
a
*NL*
youngster
who
was
not
sorry
to
vex
Minchin
with
impunity
,
exactly
what
*NL*
had
occurred
:
he
privately
pronounced
that
it
was
indecent
in
a
general
*NL*
practitioner
to
contradict
a
physician
's
diagnosis
in
that
open
manner
,
*NL*
and
afterwards
agreed
with
Wrench
that
Lydgate
was
disagreeably
*NL*
inattentive
to
etiquette
.
Lydgate
did
not
make
the
affair
a
ground
for
*NL*
valuing
himself
or
-LRB-
very
particularly
-RRB-
despising
Minchin
,
such
*NL*
rectification
of
misjudgments
often
happening
among
men
of
equal
*NL*
qualifications
.
But
report
took
up
this
amazing
case
of
tumor
,
not
*NL*
clearly
distinguished
from
cancer
,
and
considered
the
more
awful
for
*NL*
being
of
the
wandering
sort
;
till
much
prejudice
against
Lydgate
's
*NL*
method
as
to
drugs
was
overcome
by
the
proof
of
his
marvellous
skill
in
*NL*
the
speedy
restoration
of
Nancy
Nash
after
she
had
been
rolling
and
*NL*
rolling
in
agonies
from
the
presence
of
a
tumor
both
hard
and
*NL*
obstinate
,
but
nevertheless
compelled
to
yield
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
could
Lydgate
help
himself
?
It
is
offensive
to
tell
a
lady
when
*NL*
she
is
expressing
her
amazement
at
your
skill
,
that
she
is
altogether
*NL*
mistaken
and
rather
foolish
in
her
amazement
.
And
to
have
entered
into
*NL*
the
nature
of
diseases
would
only
have
added
to
his
breaches
of
medical
*NL*
propriety
.
Thus
he
had
to
wince
under
a
promise
of
success
given
by
*NL*
that
ignorant
praise
which
misses
every
valid
quality
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
case
of
a
more
conspicuous
patient
,
Mr.
Borthrop
Trumbull
,
*NL*
Lydgate
was
conscious
of
having
shown
himself
something
better
than
an
*NL*
every-day
doctor
,
though
here
too
it
was
an
equivocal
advantage
that
he
*NL*
won
.
The
eloquent
auctioneer
was
seized
with
pneumonia
,
and
having
*NL*
been
a
patient
of
Mr.
Peacock
's
,
sent
for
Lydgate
,
whom
he
had
*NL*
expressed
his
intention
to
patronize
.
Mr
Trumbull
was
a
robust
man
,
a
*NL*
good
subject
for
trying
the
expectant
theory
upon
--
watching
the
course
*NL*
of
an
interesting
disease
when
left
as
much
as
possible
to
itself
,
so
*NL*
that
the
stages
might
be
noted
for
future
guidance
;
and
from
the
air
*NL*
with
which
he
described
his
sensations
Lydgate
surmised
that
he
would
*NL*
like
to
be
taken
into
his
medical
man
's
confidence
,
and
be
represented
*NL*
as
a
partner
in
his
own
cure
.
The
auctioneer
heard
,
without
much
*NL*
surprise
,
that
his
was
a
constitution
which
-LRB-
always
with
due
watching
-RRB-
*NL*
might
be
left
to
itself
,
so
as
to
offer
a
beautiful
example
of
a
*NL*
disease
with
all
its
phases
seen
in
clear
delineation
,
and
that
he
*NL*
probably
had
the
rare
strength
of
mind
voluntarily
to
become
the
test
*NL*
of
a
rational
procedure
,
and
thus
make
the
disorder
of
his
pulmonary
*NL*
functions
a
general
benefit
to
society
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Trumbull
acquiesced
at
once
,
and
entered
strongly
into
the
view
*NL*
that
an
illness
of
his
was
no
ordinary
occasion
for
medical
science
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
fear
,
sir
;
you
are
not
speaking
to
one
who
is
altogether
*NL*
ignorant
of
the
vis
medicatrix
,
''
said
he
,
with
his
usual
superiority
of
*NL*
expression
,
made
rather
pathetic
by
difficulty
of
breathing
.
And
he
*NL*
went
without
shrinking
through
his
abstinence
from
drugs
,
much
*NL*
sustained
by
application
of
the
thermometer
which
implied
the
*NL*
importance
of
his
temperature
,
by
the
sense
that
he
furnished
objects
*NL*
for
the
microscope
,
and
by
learning
many
new
words
which
seemed
suited
*NL*
to
the
dignity
of
his
secretions
.
For
Lydgate
was
acute
enough
to
*NL*
indulge
him
with
a
little
technical
talk
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
may
be
imagined
that
Mr.
Trumbull
rose
from
his
couch
with
a
*NL*
disposition
to
speak
of
an
illness
in
which
he
had
manifested
the
*NL*
strength
of
his
mind
as
well
as
constitution
;
and
he
was
not
backward
*NL*
in
awarding
credit
to
the
medical
man
who
had
discerned
the
quality
of
*NL*
patient
he
had
to
deal
with
.
The
auctioneer
was
not
an
ungenerous
man
,
*NL*
and
liked
to
give
others
their
due
,
feeling
that
he
could
afford
it
.
*NL*
He
had
caught
the
words
``
expectant
method
,
''
and
rang
chimes
on
this
and
*NL*
other
learned
phrases
to
accompany
the
assurance
that
Lydgate
``
knew
a
*NL*
thing
or
two
more
than
the
rest
of
the
doctors
--
was
far
better
versed
*NL*
in
the
secrets
of
his
profession
than
the
majority
of
his
compeers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
had
happened
before
the
affair
of
Fred
Vincy
's
illness
had
given
*NL*
to
Mr.
Wrench
's
enmity
towards
Lydgate
more
definite
personal
ground
.
*NL*
The
new-comer
already
threatened
to
be
a
nuisance
in
the
shape
of
*NL*
rivalry
,
and
was
certainly
a
nuisance
in
the
shape
of
practical
*NL*
criticism
or
reflections
on
his
hard-driven
elders
,
who
had
had
*NL*
something
else
to
do
than
to
busy
themselves
with
untried
notions
.
His
*NL*
practice
had
spread
in
one
or
two
quarters
,
and
from
the
first
the
*NL*
report
of
his
high
family
had
led
to
his
being
pretty
generally
*NL*
invited
,
so
that
the
other
medical
men
had
to
meet
him
at
dinner
in
the
*NL*
best
houses
;
and
having
to
meet
a
man
whom
you
dislike
is
not
observed
*NL*
always
to
end
in
a
mutual
attachment
.
There
was
hardly
ever
so
much
*NL*
unanimity
among
them
as
in
the
opinion
that
Lydgate
was
an
arrogant
*NL*
young
fellow
,
and
yet
ready
for
the
sake
of
ultimately
predominating
to
*NL*
show
a
crawling
subservience
to
Bulstrode
.
That
Mr.
Farebrother
,
whose
*NL*
name
was
a
chief
flag
of
the
anti-Bulstrode
party
,
always
defended
*NL*
Lydgate
and
made
a
friend
of
him
,
was
referred
to
Farebrother
's
*NL*
unaccountable
way
of
fighting
on
both
sides
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
was
plenty
of
preparation
for
the
outburst
of
professional
disgust
*NL*
at
the
announcement
of
the
laws
Mr.
Bulstrode
was
laying
down
for
the
*NL*
direction
of
the
New
Hospital
,
which
were
the
more
exasperating
because
*NL*
there
was
no
present
possibility
of
interfering
with
his
will
and
*NL*
pleasure
,
everybody
except
Lord
Medlicote
having
refused
help
towards
*NL*
the
building
,
on
the
ground
that
they
preferred
giving
to
the
Old
*NL*
Infirmary
.
Mr.
Bulstrode
met
all
the
expenses
,
and
had
ceased
to
be
*NL*
sorry
that
he
was
purchasing
the
right
to
carry
out
his
notions
of
*NL*
improvement
without
hindrance
from
prejudiced
coadjutors
;
but
he
had
*NL*
had
to
spend
large
sums
,
and
the
building
had
lingered
.
Caleb
Garth
*NL*
had
undertaken
it
,
had
failed
during
its
progress
,
and
before
the
*NL*
interior
fittings
were
begun
had
retired
from
the
management
of
the
*NL*
business
;
and
when
referring
to
the
Hospital
he
often
said
that
however
*NL*
Bulstrode
might
ring
if
you
tried
him
,
he
liked
good
solid
carpentry
*NL*
and
masonry
,
and
had
a
notion
both
of
drains
and
chimneys
.
In
fact
,
*NL*
the
Hospital
had
become
an
object
of
intense
interest
to
Bulstrode
,
and
*NL*
he
would
willingly
have
continued
to
spare
a
large
yearly
sum
that
he
*NL*
might
rule
it
dictatorially
without
any
Board
;
but
he
had
another
*NL*
favorite
object
which
also
required
money
for
its
accomplishment
:
he
*NL*
wished
to
buy
some
land
in
the
neighborhood
of
Middlemarch
,
and
*NL*
therefore
he
wished
to
get
considerable
contributions
towards
*NL*
maintaining
the
Hospital
.
Meanwhile
he
framed
his
plan
of
management
.
*NL*
The
Hospital
was
to
be
reserved
for
fever
in
all
its
forms
;
Lydgate
was
*NL*
to
be
chief
medical
superintendent
,
that
he
might
have
free
authority
*NL*
to
pursue
all
comparative
investigations
which
his
studies
,
*NL*
particularly
in
Paris
,
had
shown
him
the
importance
of
,
the
other
*NL*
medical
visitors
having
a
consultative
influence
,
but
no
power
to
*NL*
contravene
Lydgate
's
ultimate
decisions
;
and
the
general
management
was
*NL*
to
be
lodged
exclusively
in
the
hands
of
five
directors
associated
with
*NL*
Mr.
Bulstrode
,
who
were
to
have
votes
in
the
ratio
of
their
*NL*
contributions
,
the
Board
itself
filling
up
any
vacancy
in
its
numbers
,
*NL*
and
no
mob
of
small
contributors
being
admitted
to
a
share
of
*NL*
government
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
an
immediate
refusal
on
the
part
of
every
medical
man
in
the
*NL*
town
to
become
a
visitor
at
the
Fever
Hospital
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
''
said
Lydgate
to
Mr.
Bulstrode
,
``
we
have
a
capital
*NL*
house-surgeon
and
dispenser
,
a
clear-headed
,
neat-handed
fellow
;
we
'll
*NL*
get
Webbe
from
Crabsley
,
as
good
a
country
practitioner
as
any
of
them
,
*NL*
to
come
over
twice
a-week
,
and
in
case
of
any
exceptional
operation
,
*NL*
Protheroe
will
come
from
Brassing
.
I
must
work
the
harder
,
that
's
all
,
*NL*
and
I
have
given
up
my
post
at
the
Infirmary
.
The
plan
will
flourish
*NL*
in
spite
of
them
,
and
then
they
'll
be
glad
to
come
in
.
Things
ca
n't
*NL*
last
as
they
are
:
there
must
be
all
sorts
of
reform
soon
,
and
then
*NL*
young
fellows
may
be
glad
to
come
and
study
here
.
''
Lydgate
was
in
high
*NL*
spirits
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
not
flinch
,
you
may
depend
upon
it
,
Mr.
Lydgate
,
''
said
Mr.
*NL*
Bulstrode
.
``
While
I
see
you
carrying
out
high
intentions
with
vigor
,
*NL*
you
shall
have
my
unfailing
support
.
And
I
have
humble
confidence
that
*NL*
the
blessing
which
has
hitherto
attended
my
efforts
against
the
spirit
*NL*
of
evil
in
this
town
will
not
be
withdrawn
.
Suitable
directors
to
*NL*
assist
me
I
have
no
doubt
of
securing
.
Mr.
Brooke
of
Tipton
has
*NL*
already
given
me
his
concurrence
,
and
a
pledge
to
contribute
yearly
:
he
*NL*
has
not
specified
the
sum
--
probably
not
a
great
one
.
But
he
will
be
a
*NL*
useful
member
of
the
board
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
useful
member
was
perhaps
to
be
defined
as
one
who
would
originate
*NL*
nothing
,
and
always
vote
with
Mr.
Bulstrode
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
medical
aversion
to
Lydgate
was
hardly
disguised
now
.
Neither
Dr.
*NL*
Sprague
nor
Dr.
Minchin
said
that
he
disliked
Lydgate
's
knowledge
,
or
*NL*
his
disposition
to
improve
treatment
:
what
they
disliked
was
his
*NL*
arrogance
,
which
nobody
felt
to
be
altogether
deniable
.
They
implied
*NL*
that
he
was
insolent
,
pretentious
,
and
given
to
that
reckless
*NL*
innovation
for
the
sake
of
noise
and
show
which
was
the
essence
of
the
*NL*
charlatan
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
word
charlatan
once
thrown
on
the
air
could
not
be
let
drop
.
In
*NL*
those
days
the
world
was
agitated
about
the
wondrous
doings
of
Mr.
St.
*NL*
John
Long
,
``
noblemen
and
gentlemen
''
attesting
his
extraction
of
a
fluid
*NL*
like
mercury
from
the
temples
of
a
patient
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Toller
remarked
one
day
,
smilingly
,
to
Mrs.
Taft
,
that
``
Bulstrode
*NL*
had
found
a
man
to
suit
him
in
Lydgate
;
a
charlatan
in
religion
is
sure
*NL*
to
like
other
sorts
of
charlatans
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
indeed
,
I
can
imagine
,
''
said
Mrs.
Taft
,
keeping
the
number
of
*NL*
thirty
stitches
carefully
in
her
mind
all
the
while
;
``
there
are
so
many
*NL*
of
that
sort
.
I
remember
Mr.
Cheshire
,
with
his
irons
,
trying
to
make
*NL*
people
straight
when
the
Almighty
had
made
them
crooked
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
''
said
Mr.
Toller
,
``
Cheshire
was
all
right
--
all
fair
and
above
*NL*
board
.
But
there
's
St.
John
Long
--
that
's
the
kind
of
fellow
we
call
a
*NL*
charlatan
,
advertising
cures
in
ways
nobody
knows
anything
about
:
a
*NL*
fellow
who
wants
to
make
a
noise
by
pretending
to
go
deeper
than
other
*NL*
people
.
The
other
day
he
was
pretending
to
tap
a
man
's
brain
and
get
*NL*
quicksilver
out
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
gracious
!
what
dreadful
trifling
with
people
's
constitutions
!
''
*NL*
said
Mrs.
Taft
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
this
,
it
came
to
be
held
in
various
quarters
that
Lydgate
played
*NL*
even
with
respectable
constitutions
for
his
own
purposes
,
and
how
much
*NL*
more
likely
that
in
his
flighty
experimenting
he
should
make
sixes
and
*NL*
sevens
of
hospital
patients
.
Especially
it
was
to
be
expected
,
as
the
*NL*
landlady
of
the
Tankard
had
said
,
that
he
would
recklessly
cut
up
their
*NL*
dead
bodies
.
For
Lydgate
having
attended
Mrs.
Goby
,
who
died
*NL*
apparently
of
a
heart-disease
not
very
clearly
expressed
in
the
*NL*
symptoms
,
too
daringly
asked
leave
of
her
relatives
to
open
the
body
,
*NL*
and
thus
gave
an
offence
quickly
spreading
beyond
Parley
Street
,
where
*NL*
that
lady
had
long
resided
on
an
income
such
as
made
this
association
*NL*
of
her
body
with
the
victims
of
Burke
and
Hare
a
flagrant
insult
to
her
*NL*
memory
.
*NL*
*NL*
Affairs
were
in
this
stage
when
Lydgate
opened
the
subject
of
the
*NL*
Hospital
to
Dorothea
.
We
see
that
he
was
bearing
enmity
and
silly
*NL*
misconception
with
much
spirit
,
aware
that
they
were
partly
created
by
*NL*
his
good
share
of
success
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
will
not
drive
me
away
,
''
he
said
,
talking
confidentially
in
Mr.
*NL*
Farebrother
's
study
.
``
I
have
got
a
good
opportunity
here
,
for
the
ends
*NL*
I
care
most
about
;
and
I
am
pretty
sure
to
get
income
enough
for
our
*NL*
wants
.
By-and-by
I
shall
go
on
as
quietly
as
possible
:
I
have
no
*NL*
seductions
now
away
from
home
and
work
.
And
I
am
more
and
more
*NL*
convinced
that
it
will
be
possible
to
demonstrate
the
homogeneous
*NL*
origin
of
all
the
tissues
.
Raspail
and
others
are
on
the
same
track
,
*NL*
and
I
have
been
losing
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
no
power
of
prophecy
there
,
''
said
Mr.
Farebrother
,
who
had
been
*NL*
puffing
at
his
pipe
thoughtfully
while
Lydgate
talked
;
``
but
as
to
the
*NL*
hostility
in
the
town
,
you
'll
weather
it
if
you
are
prudent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
am
I
to
be
prudent
?
''
said
Lydgate
,
``
I
just
do
what
comes
before
me
*NL*
to
do
.
I
ca
n't
help
people
's
ignorance
and
spite
,
any
more
than
*NL*
Vesalius
could
.
It
is
n't
possible
to
square
one
's
conduct
to
silly
*NL*
conclusions
which
nobody
can
foresee
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
true
;
I
did
n't
mean
that
.
I
meant
only
two
things
.
One
is
,
*NL*
keep
yourself
as
separable
from
Bulstrode
as
you
can
:
of
course
,
you
*NL*
can
go
on
doing
good
work
of
your
own
by
his
help
;
but
do
n't
get
tied
.
*NL*
Perhaps
it
seems
like
personal
feeling
in
me
to
say
so
--
and
there
's
a
*NL*
good
deal
of
that
,
I
own
--
but
personal
feeling
is
not
always
in
the
*NL*
wrong
if
you
boil
it
down
to
the
impressions
which
make
it
simply
an
*NL*
opinion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bulstrode
is
nothing
to
me
,
''
said
Lydgate
,
carelessly
,
``
except
on
*NL*
public
grounds
.
As
to
getting
very
closely
united
to
him
,
I
am
not
*NL*
fond
enough
of
him
for
that
.
But
what
was
the
other
thing
you
meant
?
''
*NL*
said
Lydgate
,
who
was
nursing
his
leg
as
comfortably
as
possible
,
and
*NL*
feeling
in
no
great
need
of
advice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
this
.
Take
care
--
experto
crede
--
take
care
not
to
get
hampered
*NL*
about
money
matters
.
I
know
,
by
a
word
you
let
fall
one
day
,
that
you
*NL*
do
n't
like
my
playing
at
cards
so
much
for
money
.
You
are
right
enough
*NL*
there
.
But
try
and
keep
clear
of
wanting
small
sums
that
you
have
n't
*NL*
got
.
I
am
perhaps
talking
rather
superfluously
;
but
a
man
likes
to
*NL*
assume
superiority
over
himself
,
by
holding
up
his
bad
example
and
*NL*
sermonizing
on
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lydgate
took
Mr.
Farebrother
's
hints
very
cordially
,
though
he
would
*NL*
hardly
have
borne
them
from
another
man
.
He
could
not
help
remembering
*NL*
that
he
had
lately
made
some
debts
,
but
these
had
seemed
inevitable
,
*NL*
and
he
had
no
intention
now
to
do
more
than
keep
house
in
a
simple
way
.
*NL*
The
furniture
for
which
he
owed
would
not
want
renewing
;
nor
even
the
*NL*
stock
of
wine
for
a
long
while
.
*NL*
*NL*
Many
thoughts
cheered
him
at
that
time
--
and
justly
.
A
man
conscious
of
*NL*
enthusiasm
for
worthy
aims
is
sustained
under
petty
hostilities
by
the
*NL*
memory
of
great
workers
who
had
to
fight
their
way
not
without
wounds
,
*NL*
and
who
hover
in
his
mind
as
patron
saints
,
invisibly
helping
.
At
*NL*
home
,
that
same
evening
when
he
had
been
chatting
with
Mr.
Farebrother
,
*NL*
he
had
his
long
legs
stretched
on
the
sofa
,
his
head
thrown
back
,
and
*NL*
his
hands
clasped
behind
it
according
to
his
favorite
ruminating
*NL*
attitude
,
while
Rosamond
sat
at
the
piano
,
and
played
one
tune
after
*NL*
another
,
of
which
her
husband
only
knew
-LRB-
like
the
emotional
elephant
he
*NL*
was
!
-RRB-
that
they
fell
in
with
his
mood
as
if
they
had
been
melodious
*NL*
sea-breezes
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
something
very
fine
in
Lydgate
's
look
just
then
,
and
any
one
*NL*
might
have
been
encouraged
to
bet
on
his
achievement
.
In
his
dark
eyes
*NL*
and
on
his
mouth
and
brow
there
was
that
placidity
which
comes
from
the
*NL*
fulness
of
contemplative
thought
--
the
mind
not
searching
,
but
*NL*
beholding
,
and
the
glance
seeming
to
be
filled
with
what
is
behind
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Presently
Rosamond
left
the
piano
and
seated
herself
on
a
chair
close
*NL*
to
the
sofa
and
opposite
her
husband
's
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
enough
music
for
you
,
my
lord
?
''
she
said
,
folding
her
hands
*NL*
before
her
and
putting
on
a
little
air
of
meekness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
dear
,
if
you
are
tired
,
''
said
Lydgate
,
gently
,
turning
his
eyes
*NL*
and
resting
them
on
her
,
but
not
otherwise
moving
.
Rosamond
's
presence
*NL*
at
that
moment
was
perhaps
no
more
than
a
spoonful
brought
to
the
lake
,
*NL*
and
her
woman
's
instinct
in
this
matter
was
not
dull
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
absorbing
you
?
''
she
said
,
leaning
forward
and
bringing
her
*NL*
face
nearer
to
his
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
moved
his
hands
and
placed
them
gently
behind
her
shoulders
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
thinking
of
a
great
fellow
,
who
was
about
as
old
as
I
am
three
*NL*
hundred
years
ago
,
and
had
already
begun
a
new
era
in
anatomy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
guess
,
''
said
Rosamond
,
shaking
her
head
.
``
We
used
to
play
at
*NL*
guessing
historical
characters
at
Mrs.
Lemon
's
,
but
not
anatomists
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
tell
you
.
His
name
was
Vesalius
.
And
the
only
way
he
could
get
*NL*
to
know
anatomy
as
he
did
,
was
by
going
to
snatch
bodies
at
night
,
from
*NL*
graveyards
and
places
of
execution
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
said
Rosamond
,
with
a
look
of
disgust
on
her
pretty
face
,
``
I
am
*NL*
very
glad
you
are
not
Vesalius
.
I
should
have
thought
he
might
find
*NL*
some
less
horrible
way
than
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
he
could
n't
,
''
said
Lydgate
,
going
on
too
earnestly
to
take
much
*NL*
notice
of
her
answer
.
``
He
could
only
get
a
complete
skeleton
by
*NL*
snatching
the
whitened
bones
of
a
criminal
from
the
gallows
,
and
*NL*
burying
them
,
and
fetching
them
away
by
bits
secretly
,
in
the
dead
of
*NL*
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
he
is
not
one
of
your
great
heroes
,
''
said
Rosamond
,
half
*NL*
playfully
,
half
anxiously
,
``
else
I
shall
have
you
getting
up
in
the
*NL*
night
to
go
to
St.
Peter
's
churchyard
.
You
know
how
angry
you
told
me
*NL*
the
people
were
about
Mrs.
Goby
.
You
have
enemies
enough
already
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
had
Vesalius
,
Rosy
.
No
wonder
the
medical
fogies
in
Middlemarch
*NL*
are
jealous
,
when
some
of
the
greatest
doctors
living
were
fierce
upon
*NL*
Vesalius
because
they
had
believed
in
Galen
,
and
he
showed
that
Galen
*NL*
was
wrong
.
They
called
him
a
liar
and
a
poisonous
monster
.
But
the
*NL*
facts
of
the
human
frame
were
on
his
side
;
and
so
he
got
the
better
of
*NL*
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
happened
to
him
afterwards
?
''
said
Rosamond
,
with
some
*NL*
interest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
he
had
a
good
deal
of
fighting
to
the
last
.
And
they
did
*NL*
exasperate
him
enough
at
one
time
to
make
him
burn
a
good
deal
of
his
*NL*
work
.
Then
he
got
shipwrecked
just
as
he
was
coming
from
Jerusalem
to
*NL*
take
a
great
chair
at
Padua
.
He
died
rather
miserably
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
moment
's
pause
before
Rosamond
said
,
``
Do
you
know
,
Tertius
,
*NL*
I
often
wish
you
had
not
been
a
medical
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
Rosy
,
do
n't
say
that
,
''
said
Lydgate
,
drawing
her
closer
to
him
.
*NL*
``
That
is
like
saying
you
wish
you
had
married
another
man

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all

you
are
clever
enough
for
anything

you
might
easily
have

been
something
else

your
cousins
at
Quallingham
all
think
that

sunk
below

in
your
choice
of
a
profession

*NL*
*NL*
``
The
cousins
at
Quallingham
may
go
to
the
devil

said
Lydgate
,
with
*NL*
scorn
.
``
It
was
like
their
impudence
if
they
said
anything
of
the
sort
*NL*
to
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
Still

said
Rosamond
,
``
I
do

it

much
quiet
perseverance
in

``
It

the
grandest

Lydgate

*NL*
gravely
.
``
And
to
say
that
you
love
me
without
loving
the
medical
man

in
me

is
the

sort
of
thing
as
to
say
that
you
like
eating
a
peach

*NL*

``
Very

said
Rosy

dimpling
,
``
I

declare

``
No

us
like

what

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
While
Lydgate
,
safely
married
and
with
the
Hospital
under
his
command
,
*NL*
felt
himself
struggling
for
Medical
Reform
against
Middlemarch
,
*NL*
Middlemarch
was
becoming
more
and
more
conscious
of
the
national
*NL*
struggle
for
another
kind
of
Reform
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
the
time
that
Lord
John
Russell
's
measure
was
being
debated
in
the
*NL*
House
of
Commons
,
there
was
a
new
political
animation
in
Middlemarch
,
*NL*
and
a
new
definition
of
parties
which
might
show
a
decided
change
of
*NL*
balance
if
a
new
election
came
.
And
there
were
some
who
already
*NL*
predicted
this
event
,
declaring
that
a
Reform
Bill
would
never
be
*NL*
carried
by
the
actual
Parliament
.
This
was
what
Will
Ladislaw
dwelt
on
*NL*
to
Mr.
Brooke
as
a
reason
for
congratulation
that
he
had
not
yet
tried
*NL*
his
strength
at
the
hustings
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Things
will
grow
and
ripen
as
if
it
were
a
comet
year
,
''
said
Will
.
*NL*
``
The
public
temper
will
soon
get
to
a
cometary
heat
,
now
the
question
*NL*
of
Reform
has
set
in
.
There
is
likely
to
be
another
election
before
*NL*
long
,
and
by
that
time
Middlemarch
will
have
got
more
ideas
into
its
*NL*
head
.
What
we
have
to
work
at
now
is
the
`
Pioneer
'
and
political
*NL*
meetings
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
right
,
Ladislaw
;
we
shall
make
a
new
thing
of
opinion
here
,
''
*NL*
said
Mr.
Brooke
.
``
Only
I
want
to
keep
myself
independent
about
Reform
,
*NL*
you
know
;
I
do
n't
want
to
go
too
far
.
I
want
to
take
up
*NL*
Wilberforce
's
and
Romilly
's
line
,
you
know
,
and
work
at
Negro
*NL*
Emancipation
,
Criminal
Law
--
that
kind
of
thing
.
But
of
course
I
should
*NL*
support
Grey
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
go
in
for
the
principle
of
Reform
,
you
must
be
prepared
to
take
*NL*
what
the
situation
offers
,
''
said
Will
.
``
If
everybody
pulled
for
his
*NL*
own
bit
against
everybody
else
,
the
whole
question
would
go
to
tatters
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
I
agree
with
you
--
I
quite
take
that
point
of
view
.
I
should
*NL*
put
it
in
that
light
.
I
should
support
Grey
,
you
know
.
But
I
do
n't
*NL*
want
to
change
the
balance
of
the
constitution
,
and
I
do
n't
think
Grey
*NL*
would
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
that
is
what
the
country
wants
,
''
said
Will
.
``
Else
there
would
be
*NL*
no
meaning
in
political
unions
or
any
other
movement
that
knows
what
*NL*
it
's
about
.
It
wants
to
have
a
House
of
Commons
which
is
not
weighted
*NL*
with
nominees
of
the
landed
class
,
but
with
representatives
of
the
*NL*
other
interests
.
And
as
to
contending
for
a
reform
short
of
that
,
it
*NL*
is
like
asking
for
a
bit
of
an
avalanche
which
has
already
begun
to
*NL*
thunder
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
fine
,
Ladislaw
:
that
is
the
way
to
put
it
.
Write
that
down
,
*NL*
now
.
We
must
begin
to
get
documents
about
the
feeling
of
the
country
,
*NL*
as
well
as
the
machine-breaking
and
general
distress
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
to
documents
,
''
said
Will
,
``
a
two-inch
card
will
hold
plenty
.
A
few
*NL*
rows
of
figures
are
enough
to
deduce
misery
from
,
and
a
few
more
will
*NL*
show
the
rate
at
which
the
political
determination
of
the
people
is
*NL*
growing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
:
draw
that
out
a
little
more
at
length

Ladislaw
.
That
is
an
*NL*
idea

now
:
write
it
out
in
the
`
Pioneer
.

Put
the
figures
and
deduce
*NL*
the
misery
,
you
know
;
and
put
the
other
figures
and
deduce
--
and
so
on
.
*NL*
You
have
a
way
of
putting
things

Burke
,
now
:
--
when
I
think
of
Burke
,
*NL*
I
ca
n't
help
wishing
somebody
had
a
pocket-borough
to
give
you
,
*NL*
Ladislaw
.
You
'd
never
get
elected
,
you
know
.
And
we
shall
always
want
*NL*
talent
in
the
House
:
reform
as
we
will
,
we
shall
always
want
talent
.
*NL*
That
avalanche
and
the
thunder
,
now
,
was
really
a
little
like
Burke
.
I
*NL*
want
that
sort
of
thing
--
not
ideas
,
you
know
,
but
a
way
of
putting
*NL*
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pocket-boroughs
would
be
a
fine
thing
,
''
said
Ladislaw
,
``
if
they
were
*NL*
always
in
the
right
pocket
,
and
there
were
always
a
Burke
at
hand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Will
was
not
displeased
with
that
complimentary
comparison
,
even
from
*NL*
Mr.
Brooke
;
for
it
is
a
little
too
trying
to
human
flesh
to
be
*NL*
conscious
of
expressing
one
's
self
better
than
others
and
never
to
have
*NL*
it
noticed
,
and
in
the
general
dearth
of
admiration
for
the
right
*NL*
thing
,
even
a
chance
bray
of
applause
falling
exactly
in
time
is
rather
*NL*
fortifying
.
Will
felt
that
his
literary
refinements
were
usually
*NL*
beyond
the
limits
of
Middlemarch
perception
;
nevertheless
,
he
was
*NL*
beginning
thoroughly
to
like
the
work
of
which
when
he
began
he
had
*NL*
said
to
himself
rather
languidly
,
``
Why
not
?
''
--
and
he
studied
the
*NL*
political
situation
with
as
ardent
an
interest
as
he
had
ever
given
to
*NL*
poetic
metres
or
mediaevalism
.
It
is
undeniable
that
but
for
the
*NL*
desire
to
be
where
Dorothea
was
,
and
perhaps
the
want
of
knowing
what
*NL*
else
to
do
,
Will
would
not
at
this
time
have
been
meditating
on
the
*NL*
needs
of
the
English
people
or
criticising
English
statesmanship
:
he
*NL*
would
probably
have
been
rambling
in
Italy
sketching
plans
for
several
*NL*
dramas
,
trying
prose
and
finding
it
too
jejune
,
trying
verse
and
*NL*
finding
it
too
artificial
,
beginning
to
copy
``
bits
''
from
old
pictures
,
*NL*
leaving
off
because
they
were
``
no
good
,
''
and
observing
that
,
after
all
,
*NL*
self-culture
was
the
principal
point
;
while
in
politics
he
would
have
*NL*
been
sympathizing
warmly
with
liberty
and
progress
in
general
.
Our
*NL*
sense
of
duty
must
often
wait
for
some
work
which
shall
take
the
place
*NL*
of
dilettanteism
and
make
us
feel
that
the
quality
of
our
action
is
not
*NL*
a
matter
of
indifference
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ladislaw
had
now
accepted
his
bit
of
work
,
though
it
was
not
that
*NL*
indeterminate
loftiest
thing
which
he
had
once
dreamed
of
as
alone
*NL*
worthy
of
continuous
effort
.
His
nature
warmed
easily
in
the
presence
*NL*
of
subjects
which
were
visibly
mixed
with
life
and
action
,
and
the
*NL*
easily
stirred
rebellion
in
him
helped
the
glow
of
public
spirit
.
In
*NL*
spite
of
Mr.
Casaubon
and
the
banishment
from
Lowick
,
he
was
rather
*NL*
happy
;
getting
a
great
deal
of
fresh
knowledge
in
a
vivid
way
and
for
*NL*
practical
purposes
,
and
making
the
``
Pioneer
''
celebrated
as
far
as
*NL*
Brassing
-LRB-
never
mind
the
smallness
of
the
area
;
the
writing
was
not
*NL*
worse
than
much
that
reaches
the
four
corners
of
the
earth
-RRB-
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Brooke
was
occasionally
irritating
;
but
Will
's
impatience
was
*NL*
relieved
by
the
division
of
his
time
between
visits
to
the
Grange
and
*NL*
retreats
to
his
Middlemarch
lodgings
,
which
gave
variety
to
his
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shift
the
pegs
a
little
,
''
he
said
to
himself
,
``
and
Mr.
Brooke
might
be
*NL*
in
the
Cabinet
,
while
I
was
Under-Secretary
.
That
is
the
common
order
*NL*
of
things
:
the
little
waves
make
the
large
ones
and
are
of
the
same
*NL*
pattern
.
I
am
better
here
than
in
the
sort
of
life
Mr.
Casaubon
would
*NL*
have
trained
me
for
,
where
the
doing
would
be
all
laid
down
by
a
*NL*
precedent
too
rigid
for
me
to
react
upon
.
I
do
n't
care
for
prestige
or
*NL*
high
pay
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
Lydgate
had
said
of
him
,
he
was
a
sort
of
gypsy
,
rather
enjoying
the
*NL*
sense
of
belonging
to
no
class
;
he
had
a
feeling
of
romance
in
his
*NL*
position
,
and
a
pleasant
consciousness
of
creating
a
little
surprise
*NL*
wherever
he
went
.
That
sort
of
enjoyment
had
been
disturbed
when
he
*NL*
had
felt
some
new
distance
between
himself
and
Dorothea
in
their
*NL*
accidental
meeting
at
Lydgate
's
,
and
his
irritation
had
gone
out
*NL*
towards
Mr.
Casaubon
,
who
had
declared
beforehand
that
Will
would
lose
*NL*
caste
.
``
I
never
had
any
caste
,
''
he
would
have
said
,
if
that
prophecy
*NL*
had
been
uttered
to
him
,
and
the
quick
blood
would
have
come
and
gone
*NL*
like
breath
in
his
transparent
skin
.
But
it
is
one
thing
to
like
*NL*
defiance
,
and
another
thing
to
like
its
consequences
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
the
town
opinion
about
the
new
editor
of
the
``
Pioneer
''
was
*NL*
tending
to
confirm
Mr.
Casaubon
's
view
.
Will
's
relationship
in
that
*NL*
distinguished
quarter
did
not
,
like
Lydgate
's
high
connections
,
serve
*NL*
as
an
advantageous
introduction
:
if
it
was
rumored
that
young
Ladislaw
*NL*
was
Mr.
Casaubon
's
nephew
or
cousin
,
it
was
also
rumored
that
``
Mr.
*NL*
Casaubon
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Brooke
has
taken
him
up
,
''
said
Mr.
Hawley
,
``
because
that
is
what
no
*NL*
man
in
his
senses
could
have
expected
.
Casaubon
has
devilish
good
*NL*
reasons
,
you
may
be
sure
,
for
turning
the
cold
shoulder
on
a
young
*NL*
fellow
whose
bringing-up
he
paid
for
.
Just
like
Brooke
--
one
of
those
*NL*
fellows
who
would
praise
a
cat
to
sell
a
horse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
some
oddities
of
Will
's
,
more
or
less
poetical
,
appeared
to
support
*NL*
Mr.
Keck
,
the
editor
of
the
``
Trumpet
,
''
in
asserting
that
Ladislaw
,
if
*NL*
the
truth
were
known
,
was
not
only
a
Polish
emissary
but
crack-brained
,
*NL*
which
accounted
for
the
preternatural
quickness
and
glibness
of
his
*NL*
speech
when
he
got
on
to
a
platform
--
as
he
did
whenever
he
had
an
*NL*
opportunity
,
speaking
with
a
facility
which
cast
reflections
on
solid
*NL*
Englishmen
generally
.
It
was
disgusting
to
Keck
to
see
a
strip
of
a
*NL*
fellow
,
with
light
curls
round
his
head
,
get
up
and
speechify
by
the
*NL*
hour
against
institutions
``
which
had
existed
when
he
was
in
his
*NL*
cradle
.
''
And
in
a
leading
article
of
the
``
Trumpet
,
''
Keck
characterized
*NL*
Ladislaw
's
speech
at
a
Reform
meeting
as
``
the
violence
of
an
*NL*
energumen
--
a
miserable
effort
to
shroud
in
the
brilliancy
of
fireworks
*NL*
the
daring
of
irresponsible
statements
and
the
poverty
of
a
knowledge
*NL*
which
was
of
the
cheapest
and
most
recent
description
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
was
a
rattling
article
yesterday
,
Keck
,
''
said
Dr.
Sprague
,
with
*NL*
sarcastic
intentions
.
``
But
what
is
an
energumen
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
a
term
that
came
up
in
the
French
Revolution
,
''
said
Keck
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
dangerous
aspect
of
Ladislaw
was
strangely
contrasted
with
other
*NL*
habits
which
became
matter
of
remark
.
He
had
a
fondness
,
half
*NL*
artistic
,
half
affectionate
,
for
little
children
--
the
smaller
they
were
*NL*
on
tolerably
active
legs
,
and
the
funnier
their
clothing
,
the
better
*NL*
Will
liked
to
surprise
and
please
them
.
We
know
that
in
Rome
he
was
*NL*
given
to
ramble
about
among
the
poor
people
,
and
the
taste
did
not
quit
*NL*
him
in
Middlemarch
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
somehow
picked
up
a
troop
of
droll
children
,
little
hatless
boys
*NL*
with
their
galligaskins
much
worn
and
scant
shirting
to
hang
out
,
*NL*
little
girls
who
tossed
their
hair
out
of
their
eyes
to
look
at
him
,
*NL*
and
guardian
brothers
at
the
mature
age
of
seven
.
This
troop
he
had
*NL*
led
out
on
gypsy
excursions
to
Halsell
Wood
at
nutting-time
,
and
since
*NL*
the
cold
weather
had
set
in
he
had
taken
them
on
a
clear
day
to
gather
*NL*
sticks
for
a
bonfire
in
the
hollow
of
a
hillside
,
where
he
drew
out
a
*NL*
small
feast
of
gingerbread
for
them
,
and
improvised
a
Punch-and-Judy
*NL*
drama
with
some
private
home-made
puppets
.
Here
was
one
oddity
.
*NL*
Another
was
,
that
in
houses
where
he
got
friendly
,
he
was
given
to
*NL*
stretch
himself
at
full
length
on
the
rug
while
he
talked
,
and
was
apt
*NL*
to
be
discovered
in
this
attitude
by
occasional
callers
for
whom
such
*NL*
an
irregularity
was
likely
to
confirm
the
notions
of
his
dangerously
*NL*
mixed
blood
and
general
laxity
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Will
's
articles
and
speeches
naturally
recommended
him
in
families
*NL*
which
the
new
strictness
of
party
division
had
marked
off
on
the
side
*NL*
of
Reform
.
He
was
invited
to
Mr.
Bulstrode
's
;
but
here
he
could
not
*NL*
lie
down
on
the
rug
,
and
Mrs.
Bulstrode
felt
that
his
mode
of
talking
*NL*
about
Catholic
countries
,
as
if
there
were
any
truce
with
Antichrist
,
*NL*
illustrated
the
usual
tendency
to
unsoundness
in
intellectual
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
Mr.
Farebrother
's
,
however
,
whom
the
irony
of
events
had
brought
on
*NL*
the
same
side
with
Bulstrode
in
the
national
movement
,
Will
became
a
*NL*
favorite
with
the
ladies
;
especially
with
little
Miss
Noble
,
whom
it
*NL*
was
one
of
his
oddities
to
escort
when
he
met
her
in
the
street
with
*NL*
her
little
basket
,
giving
her
his
arm
in
the
eyes
of
the
town
,
and
*NL*
insisting
on
going
with
her
to
pay
some
call
where
she
distributed
her
*NL*
small
filchings
from
her
own
share
of
sweet
things
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
house
where
he
visited
oftenest
and
lay
most
on
the
rug
was
*NL*
Lydgate
's
.
The
two
men
were
not
at
all
alike
,
but
they
agreed
none
the
*NL*
worse
.
Lydgate
was
abrupt
but
not
irritable
,
taking
little
notice
of
*NL*
megrims
in
healthy
people
;
and
Ladislaw
did
not
usually
throw
away
his
*NL*
susceptibilities
on
those
who
took
no
notice
of
them
.
With
Rosamond
,
*NL*
on
the
other
hand
,
he
pouted
and
was
wayward
--
nay
,
often
*NL*
uncomplimentary
,
much
to
her
inward
surprise
;
nevertheless
he
was
*NL*
gradually
becoming
necessary
to
her
entertainment
by
his
companionship
*NL*
in
her
music
,
his
varied
talk
,
and
his
freedom
from
the
grave
*NL*
preoccupation
which
,
with
all
her
husband
's
tenderness
and
indulgence
,
*NL*
often
made
his
manners
unsatisfactory
to
her
,
and
confirmed
her
dislike
*NL*
of
the
medical
profession
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lydgate
,
inclined
to
be
sarcastic
on
the
superstitious
faith
of
the
*NL*
people
in
the
efficacy
of
``
the
bill
,
''
while
nobody
cared
about
the
low
*NL*
state
of
pathology
,
sometimes
assailed
Will
with
troublesome
questions
.
*NL*
One
evening
in
March
,
Rosamond
in
her
cherry-colored
dress
with
*NL*
swansdown
trimming
about
the
throat
sat
at
the
tea-table
;
Lydgate
,
*NL*
lately
come
in
tired
from
his
outdoor
work
,
was
seated
sideways
on
an
*NL*
easy-chair
by
the
fire
with
one
leg
over
the
elbow
,
his
brow
looking
a
*NL*
little
troubled
as
his
eyes
rambled
over
the
columns
of
the
``
Pioneer
,
''
*NL*
while
Rosamond
,
having
noticed
that
he
was
perturbed
,
avoided
looking
*NL*
at
him
,
and
inwardly
thanked
heaven
that
she
herself
had
not
a
moody
*NL*
disposition
.
Will
Ladislaw
was
stretched
on
the
rug
contemplating
the
*NL*
curtain-pole
abstractedly
,
and
humming
very
low
the
notes
of
``
When
*NL*
first
I
saw
thy
face
;
''
while
the
house
spaniel
,
also
stretched
out
with
*NL*
small
choice
of
room
,
looked
from
between
his
paws
at
the
usurper
of
*NL*
the
rug
with
silent
but
strong
objection
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rosamond
bringing
Lydgate
his
cup
of
tea
,
he
threw
down
the
paper
,
and
*NL*
said
to
Will
,
who
had
started
up
and
gone
to
the
table
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
no
use
your
puffing
Brooke
as
a
reforming
landlord
,
Ladislaw
:
*NL*
they
only
pick
the
more
holes
in
his
coat
in
the
`
Trumpet
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
matter
;
those
who
read
the
`
Pioneer
'
do
n't
read
the
`
Trumpet

'
''
*NL*
said
Will
,
swallowing
his
tea
and
walking
about
.
``
Do
you
suppose
the
*NL*
public
reads
with
a
view
to
its
own
conversion
?
We
should
have
a
*NL*
witches
'
brewing
with
a
vengeance
then
--

Mingle
,
mingle
,
mingle

*NL*
mingle

You
that

nobody
would
know

side
he
was
*NL*
going
to
take
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Farebrother
says
,
he
does
n't
believe
Brooke
would
get
elected
if
the
*NL*
opportunity
came
:
the
very
men
who
profess
to
be
for
him
would
bring
*NL*
another
member
out
of
the
bag
at
the
right

*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
no

trying

It
's
good
to
have
resident
members

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
said
Lydgate
,
who
was
much
given
to
use
that
inconvenient
word
*NL*
in
a
curt
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
represent
the
local
stupidity
better

said
Will
,
laughing
,
and
*NL*
shaking
his
curls
;
``

they
are
kept

best
behavior

he

done
some
good

things
on
his
estate

never
would
have
done

for
this

Parliamentary
bite

*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
not
fitted
to
be

said
Lydgate
,
with
contemptuous
*NL*
decision
.
``
He
would
disappoint
everybody
who
counted
on
him

I
can
see

Only

there
Bulstrode
holds
the
reins

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
depends
on
how
you
fix
your
standard

said
Will

*NL*
``

good
enough
for

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
the
way
with

political
writers

crying
up

a
universal
cure

and
crying
up
men

``

said
Will
,
who
could
find
reasons
impromptu
,
when
*NL*
he
had
not
thought
of
a
question
beforehand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
no
excuse

encouraging
the
superstitious
exaggeration
of

hopes
about
this

helping
the
cry

swallow
it
*NL*
whole
and
to
send
up
voting
popinjays
who
are
good
for
nothing
but
to
*NL*
carry
it
.
You
go
against
rottenness
,
and
there
is
nothing
more
*NL*
thoroughly
rotten
than
making
people
believe
that
society
can
be
cured
*NL*
by
a
political
hocus-pocus
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
very
fine
,
my
dear
fellow

But
your
cure
must
begin
somewhere
,
*NL*
and
put
it
that
a
thousand
things
which
debase
a
population
can
never
*NL*
be
reformed
without
this
particular
reform
to
begin
with
.
Look
what
*NL*
Stanley
said
the
other
day
--
that
the
House
had
been
tinkering
long
*NL*
enough
at
small
questions
of
bribery
,
inquiring
whether
this
or
that
*NL*
voter
has
had
a
guinea
when
everybody
knows
that
the
seats
have
been
*NL*
sold
wholesale
.
Wait
for
wisdom
and
conscience
in
public
*NL*
agents
--
fiddlestick
!
The
only
conscience
we
can
trust
to
is
the
*NL*
massive
sense
of
wrong
in
a
class
,
and
the
best
wisdom
that
will
work
*NL*
is
the
wisdom
of
balancing
claims
.
That
's
my
text
--
which
side
is
*NL*
injured
?
I
support
the
man
who
supports
their
claims
;
not
the
virtuous
*NL*
upholder
of
the
wrong

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
general
talk
about
a
particular
case
is
mere
question
begging

*NL*
Ladislaw

When
I
say
,
I
go
in
for
the
dose
that
cures
,
it
does
n't
*NL*
follow
that
I
go
in
for
opium

Should
you
go
on

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
of
course

said
Lydgate
,
seeing
himself
checkmated
by
a
move
*NL*
which
he
had
often
used
himself
,
``

,
things
must
come
to
a
dead-lock
.
Suppose
the
worst
opinion
*NL*
in
the
town
about
Bulstrode
were
a
true
one
,
that
would
not
make
it
*NL*
less
true
that
he
has
the
sense
and
the
resolution
to
do
what
I
think
*NL*
ought
to
be
done
in
the
matters
I
know
and
care
most
about
;
but
that
is
*NL*
the
only
ground
on
which
I
go
with
him
,
''
Lydgate
added
rather
proudly
,
*NL*
bearing
in
mind
Mr.
Farebrother
's
remarks
.
``
He
is
nothing
to
me
*NL*
otherwise
;
I
would
not
cry
him
up
on
any
personal
ground
--
I
would
keep
*NL*
clear
of
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
mean
that
I
cry
up
Brooke
on
any
personal
ground
?
''
said
Will
*NL*
Ladislaw
,
nettled
,
and
turning
sharp
round
.
For
the
first
time
he
felt
*NL*
offended
with
Lydgate
;
not
the
less
so
,
perhaps
,
because
he
would
have
*NL*
declined
any
close
inquiry
into
the
growth
of
his
relation
to
Mr.
*NL*
Brooke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all
,
''
said
Lydgate
,
``
I
was
simply
explaining
my
own
action
.
I
*NL*
meant
that
a
man
may
work
for
a
special
end
with
others
whose
motives
*NL*
and
general
course
are
equivocal
,
if
he
is
quite
sure
of
his
personal
*NL*
independence
,
and
that
he
is
not
working
for
his
private
*NL*
interest
--
either
place
or
money
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
why
do
n't
you
extend
your
liberality
to
others
?
''
said
Will
,
*NL*
still
nettled
.
``
My
personal
independence
is
as
important
to
me
as
*NL*
yours
is
to
you
.
You
have
no
more
reason
to
imagine
that
I
have
*NL*
personal
expectations
from
Brooke
,
than
I
have
to
imagine
that
you
have
*NL*
personal
expectations
from
Bulstrode
.
Motives
are
points
of
honor
,
I
*NL*
suppose
--
nobody
can
prove
them
.
But
as
to
money
and
place
in
the
*NL*
world
.
''
Will
ended
,
tossing
back
his
head
,
``
I
think
it
is
pretty
clear
*NL*
that
I
am
not
determined
by
considerations
of
that
sort
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
quite
mistake
me
,
Ladislaw
,
''
said
Lydgate
,
surprised
.
He
had
been
*NL*
preoccupied
with
his
own
vindication
,
and
had
been
blind
to
what
*NL*
Ladislaw
might
infer
on
his
own
account
.
``
I
beg
your
pardon
for
*NL*
unintentionally
annoying
you
.
In
fact
,
I
should
rather
attribute
to
*NL*
you
a
romantic
disregard
of
your
own
worldly
interests
.
On
the
*NL*
political
question
,
I
referred
simply
to
intellectual
bias
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
very
unpleasant
you
both
are
this
evening
!
''
said
Rosamond
.
``
I
*NL*
can
not
conceive
why
money
should
have
been
referred
to
.
Polities
and
*NL*
Medicine
are
sufficiently
disagreeable
to
quarrel
upon
.
You
can
both
*NL*
of
you
go
on
quarrelling
with
all
the
world
and
with
each
other
on
*NL*
those
two
topics
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Rosamond
looked
mildly
neutral
as
she
said
this
,
rising
to
ring
the
*NL*
bell
,
and
then
crossing
to
her
work-table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
Rosy
!
''
said
Lydgate
,
putting
out
his
hand
to
her
as
she
was
*NL*
passing
him
.
``
Disputation
is
not
amusing
to
cherubs
.
Have
some
music
.
*NL*
Ask
Ladislaw
to
sing
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
Will
was
gone
Rosamond
said
to
her
husband
,
``
What
put
you
out
of
*NL*
temper
this
evening
,
Tertius
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Me
?
It
was
Ladislaw
who
was
out
of
temper
.
He
is
like
a
bit
of
*NL*
tinder
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
mean
,
before
that
.
Something
had
vexed
you
before
you
came
in
,
*NL*
you
looked
cross
.
And
that
made
you
begin
to
dispute
with
Mr.
*NL*
Ladislaw
.
You
hurt
me
very
much
when
you
look
so

Tertius

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
I
?
Then
I
am
a
brute
,

said
Lydgate
,
caressing
her
penitently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
vexed
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
outdoor
things
--
business
.
''
It
was
really
a
letter
insisting
on
*NL*
the
payment
of
a
bill
for
furniture
.
But
Rosamond
was
expecting
to
*NL*
have
a
baby
,
and
Lydgate
wished
to
save
her
from
any
perturbation
.

CHAPTER
XLVII
.
*NL*
*NL*
Was
never
true
love
loved
in
vain
,
*NL*
For
truest
love
is
highest
gain
.
*NL*
No
art
can
make
it
:
it
must
spring
*NL*
Where
elements
are
fostering
.
*NL*
So
in

and

Springs

little
native
flower
,
*NL*
Downward

and

Shapen

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
happened
to
be
on
a
Saturday
evening
that
Will
Ladislaw
had
that
*NL*
little
discussion
with
Lydgate
.
Its
effect
when
he
went
to
his
own
*NL*
rooms
was
to
make
him
sit
up
half
the
night
,
thinking
over
again
,
under
*NL*
a
new
irritation
,
all
that
he
had
before
thought
of
his
having
settled
*NL*
in
Middlemarch
and
harnessed
himself
with
Mr.
Brooke
.
Hesitations
*NL*
before
he
had
taken
the
step
had
since
turned
into
susceptibility
to
*NL*
every
hint
that
he
would
have
been
wiser
not
to
take
it
;
and
hence
came
*NL*
his
heat
towards
Lydgate
--
a
heat
which
still
kept
him
restless
.
Was
he
*NL*
not
making
a
fool
of
himself
?
--
and
at
a
time
when
he
was
more
than
*NL*
ever
conscious
of
being
something
better
than
a
fool
?
And
for
what
end
?
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
for
no
definite
end
.
True
,
he
had
dreamy
visions
of
*NL*
possibilities
:
there
is
no
human
being
who
having
both
passions
and
*NL*
thoughts
does
not
think
in
consequence
of
his
passions
--
does
not
find
*NL*
images
rising
in
his
mind
which
soothe
the
passion
with
hope
or
sting
*NL*
it
with
dread
.
But
this
,
which
happens
to
us
all
,
happens
to
some
with
*NL*
a
wide
difference
;
and
Will
was
not
one
of
those
whose
wit
``
keeps
the
*NL*
roadway
:
''
he
had
his
bypaths
where
there
were
little
joys
of
his
own
*NL*
choosing
,
such
as
gentlemen
cantering
on
the
highroad
might
have
*NL*
thought
rather
idiotic
.
The
way
in
which
he
made
a
sort
of
happiness
*NL*
for
himself
out
of
his
feeling
for
Dorothea
was
an
example
of
this
.
It
*NL*
may
seem
strange
,
but
it
is
the
fact
,
that
the
ordinary
vulgar
vision
*NL*
of
which
Mr.
Casaubon
suspected
him
--
namely
,
that
Dorothea
might
become
*NL*
a
widow
,
and
that
the
interest
he
had
established
in
her
mind
might
*NL*
turn
into
acceptance
of
him
as
a
husband
--
had
no
tempting
,
arresting
*NL*
power
over
him
;
he
did
not
live
in
the
scenery
of
such
an
event
,
and
*NL*
follow
it
out
,
as
we
all
do
with
that
imagined
``
otherwise
''
which
is
our
*NL*
practical
heaven
.
It
was
not
only
that
he
was
unwilling
to
entertain
*NL*
thoughts
which
could
be
accused
of
baseness
,
and
was
already
uneasy
in
*NL*
the
sense
that
he
had
to
justify
himself
from
the
charge
of
*NL*
ingratitude
--
the
latent
consciousness
of
many
other
barriers
between
*NL*
himself
and
Dorothea
besides
the
existence
of
her
husband
,
had
helped
*NL*
to
turn
away
his
imagination
from
speculating
on
what
might
befall
Mr.
*NL*
Casaubon
.
And
there
were
yet
other
reasons
.
Will
,
we
know
,
could
not
*NL*
bear
the
thought
of
any
flaw
appearing
in
his
crystal
:
he
was
at
once
*NL*
exasperated
and
delighted
by
the
calm
freedom
with
which
Dorothea
*NL*
looked
at
him
and
spoke
to
him
,
and
there
was
something
so
exquisite
in
*NL*
thinking
of
her
just
as
she
was
,
that
he
could
not
long
for
a
change
*NL*
which
must
somehow
change
her
.
Do
we
not
shun
the
street
version
of
a
*NL*
fine
melody
?
--
or
shrink
from
the
news
that
the
rarity
--
some
bit
of
*NL*
chiselling
or
engraving
perhaps
--
which
we
have
dwelt
on
even
with
*NL*
exultation
in
the
trouble
it
has
cost
us
to
snatch
glimpses
of
it
,
is
*NL*
really
not
an
uncommon
thing
,
and
may
be
obtained
as
an
every-day
*NL*
possession
?
Our
good
depends
on
the
quality
and
breadth
of
our
*NL*
emotion
;
and
to
Will
,
a
creature
who
cared
little
for
what
are
called
*NL*
the
solid
things
of
life
and
greatly
for
its
subtler
influences
,
to
*NL*
have
within
him
such
a
feeling
as
he
had
towards
Dorothea
,
was
like
the
*NL*
inheritance
of
a
fortune
.
What
others
might
have
called
the
futility
*NL*
of
his
passion
,
made
an
additional
delight
for
his
imagination
:
he
was
*NL*
conscious
of
a
generous
movement
,
and
of
verifying
in
his
own
*NL*
experience
that
higher
love-poetry
which
had
charmed
his
fancy
.
*NL*
Dorothea
,
he
said
to
himself
,
was
forever
enthroned
in
his
soul
:
no
*NL*
other
woman
could
sit
higher
than
her
footstool
;
and
if
he
could
have
*NL*
written
out
in
immortal
syllables
the
effect
she
wrought
within
him
,
he
*NL*
might
have
boasted
after
the
example
of
old
Drayton
,
that
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Queens
hereafter
might
be
glad
to
live
*NL*
Upon
the
alms
of
her
superfluous
praise
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
this
result
was
questionable
.
And
what
else
could
he
do
for
*NL*
Dorothea
?
What
was
his
devotion
worth
to
her
?
It
was
impossible
to
*NL*
tell
.
He
would
not
go
out
of
her
reach
.
He
saw
no
creature
among
her
*NL*
friends
to
whom
he
could
believe
that
she
spoke
with
the
same
simple
*NL*
confidence
as
to
him
.
She
had
once
said
that
she
would
like
him
to
*NL*
stay
;
and
stay
he
would
,
whatever
fire-breathing
dragons
might
hiss
*NL*
around
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
had
always
been
the
conclusion
of
Will
's
hesitations
.
But
he
was
*NL*
not
without
contradictoriness
and
rebellion
even
towards
his
own
*NL*
resolve
.
He
had
often
got
irritated
,
as
he
was
on
this
particular
*NL*
night
,
by
some
outside
demonstration
that
his
public
exertions
with
Mr.
*NL*
Brooke
as
a
chief
could
not
seem
as
heroic
as
he
would
like
them
to
be
,
*NL*
and
this
was
always
associated
with
the
other
ground
of
*NL*
irritation
--
that
notwithstanding
his
sacrifice
of
dignity
for
*NL*
Dorothea
's
sake
,
he
could
hardly
ever
see
her
.
Whereupon
,
not
being
*NL*
able
to
contradict
these
unpleasant
facts
,
he
contradicted
his
own
*NL*
strongest
bias
and
said
,
``
I
am
a
fool
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
since
the
inward
debate
necessarily
turned
on
Dorothea
,
*NL*
he
ended
,
as
he
had
done
before
,
only
by
getting
a
livelier
sense
of
*NL*
what
her
presence
would
be
to
him
;
and
suddenly
reflecting
that
the
*NL*
morrow
would
be
Sunday
,
he
determined
to
go
to
Lowick
Church
and
see
*NL*
her
.
He
slept
upon
that
idea
,
but
when
he
was
dressing
in
the
rational
*NL*
morning
light
,
Objection
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
will
be
a
virtual
defiance
of
Mr.
Casaubon
's
prohibition
to
visit
*NL*
Lowick
,
and
Dorothea
will
be
displeased
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nonsense
!
''
argued
Inclination
,
``
it
would
be
too
monstrous
for
him
to
*NL*
hinder
me
from
going
out
to
a
pretty
country
church
on
a
spring
*NL*
morning
.
And
Dorothea
will
be
glad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
will
be
clear
to
Mr.
Casaubon
that
you
have
come
either
to
annoy
*NL*
him
or
to
see
Dorothea
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
not
true
that
I
go
to
annoy
him
,
and
why
should
I
not
go
to
see
*NL*
Dorothea
?
Is
he
to
have
everything
to
himself
and
be
always
*NL*
comfortable
?
Let
him
smart
a
little
,
as
other
people
are
obliged
to
*NL*
do
.
I
have
always
liked
the
quaintness
of
the
church
and
congregation
;
*NL*
besides
,
I
know
the
Tuckers
:
I
shall
go
into
their
pew
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Having
silenced
Objection
by
force
of
unreason
,
Will
walked
to
Lowick
*NL*
as
if
he
had
been
on
the
way
to
Paradise
,
crossing
Halsell
Common
and
*NL*
skirting
the
wood
,
where
the
sunlight
fell
broadly
under
the
budding
*NL*
boughs
,
bringing
out
the
beauties
of
moss
and
lichen
,
and
fresh
green
*NL*
growths
piercing
the
brown
.
Everything
seemed
to
know
that
it
was
*NL*
Sunday
,
and
to
approve
of
his
going
to
Lowick
Church
.
Will
easily
felt
*NL*
happy
when
nothing
crossed
his
humor
,
and
by
this
time
the
thought
of
*NL*
vexing
Mr.
Casaubon
had
become
rather
amusing
to
him
,
making
his
face
*NL*
break
into
its
merry
smile
,
pleasant
to
see
as
the
breaking
of
sunshine
*NL*
on
the
water
--
though
the
occasion
was
not
exemplary
.
But
most
of
us
*NL*
are
apt
to
settle
within
ourselves
that
the
man
who
blocks
our
way
is
*NL*
odious
,
and
not
to
mind
causing
him
a
little
of
the
disgust
which
his
*NL*
personality
excites
in
ourselves
.
Will
went
along
with
a
small
book
*NL*
under
his
arm
and
a
hand
in
each
side-pocket
,
never
reading
,
but
*NL*
chanting
a
little
,
as
he
made
scenes
of
what
would
happen
in
church
and
*NL*
coming
out
.
He
was
experimenting
in
tunes
to
suit
some
words
of
his
*NL*
own
,
sometimes
trying
a
ready-made
melody
,
sometimes
improvising
.
The
*NL*
words
were
not
exactly
a
hymn
,
but
they
certainly
fitted
his
Sunday
*NL*
experience
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
me
,
O
me
,
what
frugal
cheer
*NL*
My
love
doth
feed
upon
!
*NL*
A
touch
,
a
ray
,
that
is
not
here
,
*NL*
A
shadow
that
is
gone
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
dream
of
breath
that
might
be
near
,
*NL*
An
inly-echoed
tone
,
*NL*
The
thought
that
one
may
think
me
dear
,
*NL*
The
place
where
one
was
known
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
tremor
of
a
banished
fear
,
*NL*
An
ill
that
was
not
done
--
*NL*
O
me
,
O
me
,
what
frugal
cheer
*NL*
My
love
doth
feed
upon
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
,
when
he
took
off
his
hat
,
shaking
his
head
backward
,
and
*NL*
showing
his
delicate
throat
as
he
sang
,
he
looked
like
an
incarnation
*NL*
of
the
spring
whose
spirit
filled
the
air
--
a
bright
creature
,
abundant
*NL*
in
uncertain
promises
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
bells
were
still
ringing
when
he
got
to
Lowick
,
and
he
went
into
*NL*
the
curate
's
pew
before
any
one
else
arrived
there
.
But
he
was
still
*NL*
left
alone
in
it
when
the
congregation
had
assembled
.
The
curate
's
pew
*NL*
was
opposite
the
rector
's
at
the
entrance
of
the
small
chancel
,
and
*NL*
Will
had
time
to
fear
that
Dorothea
might
not
come
while
he
looked
*NL*
round
at
the
group
of
rural
faces
which
made
the
congregation
from
year
*NL*
to
year
within
the
white-washed
walls
and
dark
old
pews
,
hardly
with
*NL*
more
change
than
we
see
in
the
boughs
of
a
tree
which
breaks
here
and
*NL*
there
with
age
,
but
yet
has
young
shoots
.
Mr.
Rigg
's
frog-face
was
*NL*
something
alien
and
unaccountable
,
but
notwithstanding
this
shock
to
*NL*
the
order
of
things
,
there
were
still
the
Waules
and
the
rural
stock
of
*NL*
the
Powderells
in
their
pews
side
by
side
;
brother
Samuel
's
cheek
had
*NL*
the
same
purple
round
as
ever
,
and
the
three
generations
of
decent
*NL*
cottagers
came
as
of
old
with
a
sense
of
duty
to
their
betters
*NL*
generally
--
the
smaller
children
regarding
Mr.
Casaubon
,
who
wore
the
*NL*
black
gown
and
mounted
to
the
highest
box
,
as
probably
the
chief
of
all
*NL*
betters
,
and
the
one
most
awful
if
offended
.
Even
in
1831
Lowick
was
*NL*
at
peace
,
not
more
agitated
by
Reform
than
by
the
solemn
tenor
of
the
*NL*
Sunday
sermon
.
The
congregation
had
been
used
to
seeing
Will
at
church
*NL*
in
former
days
,
and
no
one
took
much
note
of
him
except
the
choir
,
who
*NL*
expected
him
to
make
a
figure
in
the
singing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
did
at
last
appear
on
this
quaint
background
,
walking
up
the
*NL*
short
aisle
in
her
white
beaver
bonnet
and
gray
cloak
--
the
same
she
had
*NL*
worn
in
the
Vatican
.
Her
face
being
,
from
her
entrance
,
towards
the
*NL*
chancel
,
even
her
shortsighted
eyes
soon
discerned
Will
,
but
there
was
*NL*
no
outward
show
of
her
feeling
except
a
slight
paleness
and
a
grave
bow
*NL*
as
she
passed
him
.
To
his
own
surprise
Will
felt
suddenly
*NL*
uncomfortable
,
and
dared
not
look
at
her
after
they
had
bowed
to
each
*NL*
other
.
Two
minutes
later
,
when
Mr.
Casaubon
came
out
of
the
vestry
,
*NL*
and
,
entering
the
pew
,
seated
himself
in
face
of
Dorothea
,
Will
felt
*NL*
his
paralysis
more
complete
.
He
could
look
nowhere
except
at
the
choir
*NL*
in
the
little
gallery
over
the
vestry-door
:
Dorothea
was
perhaps
*NL*
pained
,
and
he
had
made
a
wretched
blunder
.
It
was
no
longer
amusing
*NL*
to
vex
Mr.
Casaubon
,
who
had
the
advantage
probably
of
watching
him
and
*NL*
seeing
that
he
dared
not
turn
his
head
.
Why
had
he
not
imagined
this
*NL*
beforehand
?
--
but
he
could
not
expect
that
he
should
sit
in
that
square
*NL*
pew
alone
,
unrelieved
by
any
Tuckers
,
who
had
apparently
departed
from
*NL*
Lowick
altogether
,
for
a
new
clergyman
was
in
the
desk
.
Still
he
*NL*
called
himself
stupid
now
for
not
foreseeing
that
it
would
be
*NL*
impossible
for
him
to
look
towards
Dorothea
--
nay
,
that
she
might
feel
*NL*
his
coming
an
impertinence
.
There
was
no
delivering
himself
from
his
*NL*
cage
,
however
;
and
Will
found
his
places
and
looked
at
his
book
as
if
*NL*
he
had
been
a
school-mistress
,
feeling
that
the
morning
service
had
*NL*
never
been
so
immeasurably
long
before
,
that
he
was
utterly
ridiculous
,
*NL*
out
of
temper
,
and
miserable
.
This
was
what
a
man
got
by
worshipping
*NL*
the
sight
of
a
woman
!
The
clerk
observed
with
surprise
that
Mr.
*NL*
Ladislaw
did
not
join
in
the
tune
of
Hanover
,
and
reflected
that
he
*NL*
might
have
a
cold
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Casaubon
did
not
preach
that
morning
,
and
there
was
no
change
in
*NL*
Will
's
situation
until
the
blessing
had
been
pronounced
and
every
one
*NL*
rose
.
It
was
the
fashion
at
Lowick
for
``
the
betters
''
to
go
out
first
.
*NL*
With
a
sudden
determination
to
break
the
spell
that
was
upon
him
,
Will
*NL*
looked
straight
at
Mr.
Casaubon
.
But
that
gentleman
's
eyes
were
on
the
*NL*
button
of
the
pew-door
,
which
he
opened
,
allowing
Dorothea
to
pass
,
and
*NL*
following
her
immediately
without
raising
his
eyelids
.
Will
's
glance
*NL*
had
caught
Dorothea
's
as
she
turned
out
of
the
pew
,
and
again
she
*NL*
bowed
,
but
this
time
with
a
look
of
agitation
,
as
if
she
were
*NL*
repressing
tears
.
Will
walked
out
after
them
,
but
they
went
on
towards
*NL*
the
little
gate
leading
out
of
the
churchyard
into
the
shrubbery
,
never
*NL*
looking
round
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
impossible
for
him
to
follow
them
,
and
he
could
only
walk
back
*NL*
sadly
at
mid-day
along
the
same
road
which
he
had
trodden
hopefully
in
*NL*
the
morning
.
The
lights
were
all
changed
for
him
both
without
and
*NL*
within
.

CHAPTER
XLVIII
*NL*
*NL*
Surely
the
golden
hours
are
turning
gray
*NL*
And
dance
no
more
,
and
vainly
strive
to
run
:
*NL*
I
see
their
white
locks
streaming
in
the
wind
--
*NL*
Each
face
is
haggard
as
it
looks
at
me
,
*NL*
Slow
turning
in
the
constant
clasping
round
*NL*
Storm-driven
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
's
distress
when
she
was
leaving
the
church
came
chiefly
from
*NL*
the
perception
that
Mr.
Casaubon
was
determined
not
to
speak
to
his
*NL*
cousin
,
and
that
Will
's
presence
at
church
had
served
to
mark
more
*NL*
strongly
the
alienation
between
them
.
Will
's
coming
seemed
to
her
*NL*
quite
excusable
,
nay
,
she
thought
it
an
amiable
movement
in
him
towards
*NL*
a
reconciliation
which
she
herself
had
been
constantly
wishing
for
.
He
*NL*
had
probably
imagined
,
as
she
had
,
that
if
Mr.
Casaubon
and
he
could
*NL*
meet
easily
,
they
would
shake
hands
and
friendly
intercourse
might
*NL*
return
.
But
now
Dorothea
felt
quite
robbed
of
that
hope
.
Will
was
*NL*
banished
further
than
ever
,
for
Mr.
Casaubon
must
have
been
newly
*NL*
embittered
by
this
thrusting
upon
him
of
a
presence
which
he
refused
to
*NL*
recognize
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
not
been
very
well
that
morning
,
suffering
from
some
difficulty
*NL*
in
breathing
,
and
had
not
preached
in
consequence
;
she
was
not
*NL*
surprised
,
therefore
,
that
he
was
nearly
silent
at
luncheon
,
still
less
*NL*
that
he
made
no
allusion
to
Will
Ladislaw
.
For
her
own
part
she
felt
*NL*
that
she
could
never
again
introduce
that
subject
.
They
usually
spent
*NL*
apart
the
hours
between
luncheon
and
dinner
on
a
Sunday
;
Mr.
Casaubon
*NL*
in
the
library
dozing
chiefly
,
and
Dorothea
in
her
boudoir
,
where
she
*NL*
was
wont
to
occupy
herself
with
some
of
her
favorite
books
.
There
was
*NL*
a
little
heap
of
them
on
the
table
in
the
bow-window
--
of
various
sorts
,
*NL*
from
Herodotus
,
which
she
was
learning
to
read
with
Mr.
Casaubon
,
to
*NL*
her
old
companion
Pascal
,
and
Keble
's
``
Christian
Year
.
''
But
to-day
*NL*
opened
one
after
another
,
and
could
read
none
of
them
.
Everything
*NL*
seemed
dreary
:
the
portents
before
the
birth
of
Cyrus
--
Jewish
*NL*
antiquities
--
oh
dear
!
--
devout
epigrams
--
the
sacred
chime
of
favorite
*NL*
hymns
--
all
alike
were
as
flat
as
tunes
beaten
on
wood
:
even
the
spring
*NL*
flowers
and
the
grass
had
a
dull
shiver
in
them
under
the
afternoon
*NL*
clouds
that
hid
the
sun
fitfully
;
even
the
sustaining
thoughts
which
*NL*
had
become
habits
seemed
to
have
in
them
the
weariness
of
long
future
*NL*
days
in
which
she
would
still
live
with
them
for
her
sole
companions
.
*NL*
It
was
another
or
rather
a
fuller
sort
of
companionship
that
poor
*NL*
Dorothea
was
hungering
for
,
and
the
hunger
had
grown
from
the
perpetual
*NL*
effort
demanded
by
her
married
life
.
She
was
always
trying
to
be
what
*NL*
her
husband
wished
,
and
never
able
to
repose
on
his
delight
in
what
she
*NL*
was
.
The
thing
that
she
liked
,
that
she
spontaneously
cared
to
have
,
*NL*
seemed
to
be
always
excluded
from
her
life
;
for
if
it
was
only
granted
*NL*
and
not
shared
by
her
husband
it
might
as
well
have
been
denied
.
About
*NL*
Will
Ladislaw
there
had
been
a
difference
between
them
from
the
first
,
*NL*
and
it
had
ended
,
since
Mr.
Casaubon
had
so
severely
repulsed
*NL*
Dorothea
's
strong
feeling
about
his
claims
on
the
family
property
,
by
*NL*
her
being
convinced
that
she
was
in
the
right
and
her
husband
in
the
*NL*
wrong
,
but
that
she
was
helpless
.
This
afternoon
the
helplessness
was
*NL*
more
wretchedly
benumbing
than
ever
:
she
longed
for
objects
who
could
*NL*
be
dear
to
her
,
and
to
whom
she
could
be
dear
.
She
longed
for
work
*NL*
which
would
be
directly
beneficent
like
the
sunshine
and
the
rain
,
and
*NL*
now
it
appeared
that
she
was
to
live
more
and
more
in
a
virtual
tomb
,
*NL*
where
there
was
the
apparatus
of
a
ghastly
labor
producing
what
would
*NL*
never
see
the
light
.
Today
she
had
stood
at
the
door
of
the
tomb
and
*NL*
seen
Will
Ladislaw
receding
into
the
distant
world
of
warm
activity
and
*NL*
fellowship
--
turning
his
face
towards
her
as
he
went
.
*NL*
*NL*
Books
were
of
no
use
.
Thinking
was
of
no
use
.
It
was
Sunday
,
and
she
*NL*
could
not
have
the
carriage
to
go
to
Celia
,
who
had
lately
had
a
baby
.
*NL*
There
was
no
refuge
now
from
spiritual
emptiness
and
discontent
,
and
*NL*
Dorothea
had
to
bear
her
bad
mood
,
as
she
would
have
borne
a
headache
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
dinner
,
at
the
hour
when
she
usually
began
to
read
aloud
,
Mr.
*NL*
Casaubon
proposed
that
they
should
go
into
the
library
,
where
,
he
said
,
*NL*
he
had
ordered
a
fire
and
lights
.
He
seemed
to
have
revived
,
and
to
be
*NL*
thinking
intently
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
library
Dorothea
observed
that
he
had
newly
arranged
a
row
of
*NL*
his
note-books
on
a
table
,
and
now
he
took
up
and
put
into
her
hand
a
*NL*
well-known
volume
,
which
was
a
table
of
contents
to
all
the
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
oblige
me
,
my
dear
,
''
he
said
,
seating
himself
,
``
if
instead
of
*NL*
other
reading
this
evening
,
you
will
go
through
this
aloud
,
pencil
in
*NL*
hand
,
and
at
each
point
where
I
say
`
mark
,
'
will
make
a
cross
with
your
*NL*
pencil
.
This
is
the
first
step
in
a
sifting
process
which
I
have
long
*NL*
had
in
view
,
and
as
we
go
on
I
shall
be
able
to
indicate
to
you
certain
*NL*
principles
of
selection
whereby
you
will
,
I
trust
,
have
an
intelligent
*NL*
participation
in
my
purpose
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
proposal
was
only
one
more
sign
added
to
many
since
his
memorable
*NL*
interview
with
Lydgate
,
that
Mr.
Casaubon
's
original
reluctance
to
let
*NL*
Dorothea
work
with
him
had
given
place
to
the
contrary
disposition
,
*NL*
namely
,
to
demand
much
interest
and
labor
from
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
she
had
read
and
marked
for
two
hours
,
he
said
,
``
We
will
take
the
*NL*
volume
up-stairs
--
and
the
pencil
,
if
you
please
--
and
in
case
of
*NL*
reading
in
the
night
,
we
can
pursue
this
task
.
It
is
not
wearisome
to
*NL*
you
,
I
trust
,
Dorothea
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
prefer
always
reading
what
you
like
best
to
hear
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
*NL*
who
told
the
simple
truth
;
for
what
she
dreaded
was
to
exert
herself
in
*NL*
reading
or
anything
else
which
left
him
as
joyless
as
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
proof
of
the
force
with
which
certain
characteristics
in
*NL*
Dorothea
impressed
those
around
her
,
that
her
husband
,
with
all
his
*NL*
jealousy
and
suspicion
,
had
gathered
implicit
trust
in
the
integrity
of
*NL*
her
promises
,
and
her
power
of
devoting
herself
to
her
idea
of
the
*NL*
right
and
best
.
Of
late
he
had
begun
to
feel
that
these
qualities
were
*NL*
a
peculiar
possession
for
himself
,
and
he
wanted
to
engross
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
reading
in
the
night
did
come
.
Dorothea
in
her
young
weariness
had
*NL*
slept
soon
and
fast
:
she
was
awakened
by
a
sense
of
light
,
which
seemed
*NL*
to
her
at
first
like
a
sudden
vision
of
sunset
after
she
had
climbed
a
*NL*
steep
hill
:
she
opened
her
eyes
and
saw
her
husband
wrapped
in
his
warm
*NL*
gown
seating
himself
in
the
arm-chair
near
the
fire-place
where
the
*NL*
embers
were
still
glowing
.
He
had
lit
two
candles
,
expecting
that
*NL*
Dorothea
would
awake
,
but
not
liking
to
rouse
her
by
more
direct
means
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
ill
,
Edward
?
''
she
said
,
rising
immediately
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
felt
some
uneasiness
in
a
reclining
posture
.
I
will
sit
here
for
a
*NL*
time
.
''
She
threw
wood
on
the
fire
,
wrapped
herself
up
,
and
said
,
``
You
*NL*
would
like
me
to
read
to
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
would
oblige
me
greatly
by
doing
so
,
Dorothea
,
''
said
Mr.
Casaubon
,
*NL*
with
a
shade
more
meekness
than
usual
in
his
polite
manner
.
``
I
am
*NL*
wakeful
:
my
mind
is
remarkably
lucid
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
fear
that
the
excitement
may
be
too
great
for
you
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
*NL*
remembering
Lydgate
's
cautions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
am
not
conscious
of
undue
excitement
.
Thought
is
easy
.
''
*NL*
Dorothea
dared
not
insist
,
and
she
read
for
an
hour
or
more
on
the
same
*NL*
plan
as
she
had
done
in
the
evening
,
but
getting
over
the
pages
with
*NL*
more
quickness
.
Mr.
Casaubon
's
mind
was
more
alert
,
and
he
seemed
to
*NL*
anticipate
what
was
coming
after
a
very
slight
verbal
indication
,
*NL*
saying
,
``
That
will
do
--
mark
that
''
--
or
``
Pass
on
to
the
next
head
--
I
omit
*NL*
the
second
excursus
on
Crete
.
''
Dorothea
was
amazed
to
think
of
the
*NL*
bird-like
speed
with
which
his
mind
was
surveying
the
ground
where
it
*NL*
had
been
creeping
for
years
.
At
last
he
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Close
the
book
now
,
my
dear
.
We
will
resume
our
work
to-morrow
.
I
*NL*
have
deferred
it
too
long
,
and
would
gladly
see
it
completed
.
But
you
*NL*
observe
that
the
principle
on
which
my
selection
is
made
,
is
to
give
*NL*
adequate
,
and
not
disproportionate
illustration
to
each
of
the
theses
*NL*
enumerated
in
my
introduction
,
as
at
present
sketched
.
You
have
*NL*
perceived
that
distinctly
,
Dorothea
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
rather
tremulously
.
She
felt
sick
at
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
I
think
that
I
can
take
some
repose
,
''
said
Mr.
Casaubon
.
He
*NL*
laid
down
again
and
begged
her
to
put
out
the
lights
.
When
she
had
*NL*
lain
down
too
,
and
there
was
a
darkness
only
broken
by
a
dull
glow
on
*NL*
the
hearth
,
he
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Before
I
sleep
,
I
have
a
request
to
make
,
Dorothea
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
said
Dorothea
,
with
dread
in
her
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
that
you
will
let
me
know
,
deliberately
,
whether
,
in
case
of
my
*NL*
death
,
you
will
carry
out
my
wishes
:
whether
you
will
avoid
doing
what
*NL*
I
should
deprecate
,
and
apply
yourself
to
do
what
I
should
desire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
was
not
taken
by
surprise
:
many
incidents
had
been
leading
her
*NL*
to
the
conjecture
of
some
intention
on
her
husband
's
part
which
might
*NL*
make
a
new
yoke
for
her
.
She
did
not
answer
immediately
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
refuse
?
''
said
Mr.
Casaubon
,
with
more
edge
in
his
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
do
not
yet
refuse
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
in
a
clear
voice
,
the
need
of
*NL*
freedom
asserting
itself
within
her
;
``
but
it
is
too
solemn
--
I
think
it
*NL*
is
not
right
--
to
make
a
promise
when
I
am
ignorant
what
it
will
bind
me
*NL*
to
.
Whatever
affection
prompted
I
would
do
without
promising
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
would
use
your
own
judgment
:
I
ask
you
to
obey
mine
;
you
*NL*
refuse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
dear
,
no
!
''
said
Dorothea
,
beseechingly
,
crushed
by
opposing
fears
.
*NL*
``
But
may
I
wait
and
reflect
a
little
while
?
I
desire
with
my
whole
*NL*
soul
to
do
what
will
comfort
you
;
but
I
can
not
give
any
pledge
*NL*
suddenly
--
still
less
a
pledge
to
do
I
know
not
what
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
not
then
confide
in
the
nature
of
my
wishes
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Grant
me
till
to-morrow
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
beseechingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Till
to-morrow
then
,
''
said
Mr.
Casaubon
.
*NL*
*NL*
Soon
she
could
hear
that
he
was
sleeping
,
but
there
was
no
more
sleep
*NL*
for
her
.
While
she
constrained
herself
to
lie
still
lest
she
should
*NL*
disturb
him
,
her
mind
was
carrying
on
a
conflict
in
which
imagination
*NL*
ranged
its
forces
first
on
one
side
and
then
on
the
other
.
She
had
no
*NL*
presentiment
that
the
power
which
her
husband
wished
to
establish
over
*NL*
her
future
action
had
relation
to
anything
else
than
his
work
.
But
it
*NL*
was
clear
enough
to
her
that
he
would
expect
her
to
devote
herself
to
*NL*
sifting
those
mixed
heaps
of
material
,
which
were
to
be
the
doubtful
*NL*
illustration
of
principles
still
more
doubtful
.
The
poor
child
had
*NL*
become
altogether
unbelieving
as
to
the
trustworthiness
of
that
Key
*NL*
which
had
made
the
ambition
and
the
labor
of
her
husband
's
life
.
It
*NL*
was
not
wonderful
that
,
in
spite
of
her
small
instruction
,
her
judgment
*NL*
in
this
matter
was
truer
than
his
:
for
she
looked
with
unbiassed
*NL*
comparison
and
healthy
sense
at
probabilities
on
which
he
had
risked
*NL*
all
his
egoism
.
And
now
she
pictured
to
herself
the
days
,
and
months
,
*NL*
and
years
which
she
must
spend
in
sorting
what
might
be
called
*NL*
shattered
mummies
,
and
fragments
of
a
tradition
which
was
itself
a
*NL*
mosaic
wrought
from
crushed
ruins
--
sorting
them
as
food
for
a
theory
*NL*
which
was
already
withered
in
the
birth
like
an
elfin
child
.
Doubtless
*NL*
a
vigorous
error
vigorously
pursued
has
kept
the
embryos
of
truth
*NL*
a-breathing
:
the
quest
of
gold
being
at
the
same
time
a
questioning
of
*NL*
substances
,
the
body
of
chemistry
is
prepared
for
its
soul
,
and
*NL*
Lavoisier
is
born
.
But
Mr.
Casaubon
's
theory
of
the
elements
which
*NL*
made
the
seed
of
all
tradition
was
not
likely
to
bruise
itself
unawares
*NL*
against
discoveries
:
it
floated
among
flexible
conjectures
no
more
*NL*
solid
than
those
etymologies
which
seemed
strong
because
of
likeness
in
*NL*
sound
until
it
was
shown
that
likeness
in
sound
made
them
impossible
:
*NL*
it
was
a
method
of
interpretation
which
was
not
tested
by
the
necessity
*NL*
of
forming
anything
which
had
sharper
collisions
than
an
elaborate
*NL*
notion
of
Gog
and
Magog
:
it
was
as
free
from
interruption
as
a
plan
for
*NL*
threading
the
stars
together
.
And
Dorothea
had
so
often
had
to
check
*NL*
her
weariness
and
impatience
over
this
questionable
riddle-guessing
,
as
*NL*
it
revealed
itself
to
her
instead
of
the
fellowship
in
high
knowledge
*NL*
which
was
to
make
life
worthier
!
She
could
understand
well
enough
now
*NL*
why
her
husband
had
come
to
cling
to
her
,
as
possibly
the
only
hope
*NL*
left
that
his
labors
would
ever
take
a
shape
in
which
they
could
be
*NL*
given
to
the
world
.
At
first
it
had
seemed
that
he
wished
to
keep
even
*NL*
her
aloof
from
any
close
knowledge
of
what
he
was
doing
;
but
gradually
*NL*
the
terrible
stringency
of
human
need
--
the
prospect
of
a
too
speedy
*NL*
death
--
*NL*
*NL*
And
here
Dorothea
's
pity
turned
from
her
own
future
to
her
husband
's
*NL*
past
--
nay
,
to
his
present
hard
struggle
with
a
lot
which
had
grown
out
*NL*
of
that
past
:
the
lonely
labor
,
the
ambition
breathing
hardly
under
the
*NL*
pressure
of
self-distrust
;
the
goal
receding
,
and
the
heavier
limbs
;
*NL*
and
now
at
last
the
sword
visibly
trembling
above
him
!
And
had
she
not
*NL*
wished
to
marry
him
that
she
might
help
him
in
his
life
's
labor
?
--
But
*NL*
she
had
thought
the
work
was
to
be
something
greater
,
which
she
could
*NL*
serve
in
devoutly
for
its
own
sake
.
Was
it
right
,
even
to
soothe
his
*NL*
grief
--
would
it
be
possible
,
even
if
she
promised
--
to
work
as
in
a
*NL*
treadmill
fruitlessly
?
*NL*
*NL*
And
yet
,
could
she
deny
him
?
Could
she
say
,
``
I
refuse
to
content
this
*NL*
pining
hunger
?
''
It
would
be
refusing
to
do
for
him
dead
,
what
she
was
*NL*
almost
sure
to
do
for
him
living
.
If
he
lived
as
Lydgate
had
said
he
*NL*
might
,
for
fifteen
years
or
more
,
her
life
would
certainly
be
spent
in
*NL*
helping
him
and
obeying
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Still
,
there
was
a
deep
difference
between
that
devotion
to
the
living
*NL*
and
that
indefinite
promise
of
devotion
to
the
dead
.
While
he
lived
,
*NL*
he
could
claim
nothing
that
she
would
not
still
be
free
to
remonstrate
*NL*
against
,
and
even
to
refuse
.
But
--
the
thought
passed
through
her
mind
*NL*
more
than
once
,
though
she
could
not
believe
in
it
--
might
he
not
mean
*NL*
to
demand
something
more
from
her
than
she
had
been
able
to
imagine
,
*NL*
since
he
wanted
her
pledge
to
carry
out
his
wishes
without
telling
her
*NL*
exactly
what
they
were
?
No
;
his
heart
was
bound
up
in
his
work
only
:
*NL*
that
was
the
end
for
which
his
failing
life
was
to
be
eked
out
by
hers
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
,
if
she
were
to
say
,
``
No
!
if
you
die
,
I
will
put
no
finger
to
*NL*
your
work
''
--
it
seemed
as
if
she
would
be
crushing
that
bruised
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
four
hours
Dorothea
lay
in
this
conflict
,
till
she
felt
ill
and
*NL*
bewildered
,
unable
to
resolve
,
praying
mutely
.
Helpless
as
a
child
*NL*
which
has
sobbed
and
sought
too
long
,
she
fell
into
a
late
morning
*NL*
sleep
,
and
when
she
waked
Mr.
Casaubon
was
already
up
.
Tantripp
told
*NL*
her
that
he
had
read
prayers
,
breakfasted
,
and
was
in
the
library
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
saw
you
look
so
pale
,
madam
,
''
said
Tantripp
,
a
solid-figured
*NL*
woman
who
had
been
with
the
sisters
at
Lausanne
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
I
ever
high-colored
,
Tantripp
?
''
said
Dorothea
,
smiling
faintly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
not
to
say
high-colored
,
but
with
a
bloom
like
a
Chiny
rose
.
*NL*
But
always
smelling
those
leather
books
,
what
can
be
expected
?
Do
rest
*NL*
a
little
this
morning
,
madam
.
Let
me
say
you
are
ill
and
not
able
to
*NL*
go
into
that
close
library
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
,
no
!
let
me
make
haste
,
''
said
Dorothea
.
``
Mr.
Casaubon
wants
me
*NL*
particularly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
went
down
she
felt
sure
that
she
should
promise
to
fulfil
his
*NL*
wishes
;
but
that
would
be
later
in
the
day
--
not
yet
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
Dorothea
entered
the
library
,
Mr.
Casaubon
turned
round
from
the
*NL*
table
where
he
had
been
placing
some
books
,
and
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
waiting
for
your
appearance
,
my
dear
.
I
had
hoped
to
set
to
*NL*
work
at
once
this
morning
,
but
I
find
myself
under
some
indisposition
,
*NL*
probably
from
too
much
excitement
yesterday
.
I
am
going
now
to
take
a
*NL*
turn
in
the
shrubbery
,
since
the
air
is
milder
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
glad
to
hear
that
,
''
said
Dorothea
.
``
Your
mind
,
I
feared
,
was
too
*NL*
active
last
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
fain
have
it
set
at
rest
on
the
point
I
last
spoke
of
,
*NL*
Dorothea
.
You
can
now
,
I
hope
,
give
me
an
answer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
I
come
out
to
you
in
the
garden
presently
?
''
said
Dorothea
,
winning
*NL*
a
little
breathing
space
in
that
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
be
in
the
Yew-tree
Walk
for
the
next
half-hour
,
''
said
Mr.
*NL*
Casaubon
,
and
then
he
left
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
,
feeling
very
weary
,
rang
and
asked
Tantripp
to
bring
her
some
*NL*
wraps
.
She
had
been
sitting
still
for
a
few
minutes
,
but
not
in
any
*NL*
renewal
of
the
former
conflict
:
she
simply
felt
that
she
was
going
to
*NL*
say
``
Yes
''
to
her
own
doom
:
she
was
too
weak
,
too
full
of
dread
at
the
*NL*
thought
of
inflicting
a
keen-edged
blow
on
her
husband
,
to
do
anything
*NL*
but
submit
completely
.
She
sat
still
and
let
Tantripp
put
on
her
*NL*
bonnet
and
shawl
,
a
passivity
which
was
unusual
with
her
,
for
she
liked
*NL*
to
wait
on
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
bless
you
,
madam
!
''
said
Tantripp
,
with
an
irrepressible
movement
*NL*
of
love
towards
the
beautiful
,
gentle
creature
for
whom
she
felt
unable
*NL*
to
do
anything
more
,
now
that
she
had
finished
tying
the
bonnet
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
too
much
for
Dorothea
's
highly-strung
feeling
,
and
she
burst
*NL*
into
tears
,
sobbing
against
Tantripp
's
arm
.
But
soon
she
checked
*NL*
herself
,
dried
her
eyes
,
and
went
out
at
the
glass
door
into
the
*NL*
shrubbery
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
every
book
in
that
library
was
built
into
a
caticom
for
your
*NL*
master
,
''
said
Tantripp
to
Pratt
,
the
butler
,
finding
him
in
the
*NL*
breakfast-room
.
She
had
been
at
Rome
,
and
visited
the
antiquities
,
as
*NL*
we
know
;
and
she
always
declined
to
call
Mr.
Casaubon
anything
but
*NL*
``
your
master
,
''
when
speaking
to
the
other
servants
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pratt
laughed
.
He
liked
his
master
very
well
,
but
he
liked
Tantripp
*NL*
better
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Dorothea
was
out
on
the
gravel
walks
,
she
lingered
among
the
*NL*
nearer
clumps
of
trees
,
hesitating
,
as
she
had
done
once
before
,
though
*NL*
from
a
different
cause
.
Then
she
had
feared
lest
her
effort
at
*NL*
fellowship
should
be
unwelcome
;
now
she
dreaded
going
to
the
spot
where
*NL*
she
foresaw
that
she
must
bind
herself
to
a
fellowship
from
which
she
*NL*
shrank
.
Neither
law
nor
the
world
's
opinion
compelled
her
to
*NL*
this
--
only
her
husband
's
nature
and
her
own
compassion
,
only
the
ideal
*NL*
and
not
the
real
yoke
of
marriage
.
She
saw
clearly
enough
the
whole
*NL*
situation
,
yet
she
was
fettered
:
she
could
not
smite
the
stricken
soul
*NL*
that
entreated
hers
.
If
that
were
weakness
,
Dorothea
was
weak
.
But
*NL*
the
half-hour
was
passing
,
and
she
must
not
delay
longer
.
When
she
*NL*
entered
the
Yew-tree
Walk
she
could
not
see
her
husband
;
but
the
walk
*NL*
had
bends
,
and
she
went
,
expecting
to
catch
sight
of
his
figure
wrapped
*NL*
in
a
blue
cloak
,
which
,
with
a
warm
velvet
cap
,
was
his
outer
garment
*NL*
on
chill
days
for
the
garden
.
It
occurred
to
her
that
he
might
be
*NL*
resting
in
the
summer-house
,
towards
which
the
path
diverged
a
little
.
*NL*
Turning
the
angle
,
she
could
see
him
seated
on
the
bench
,
close
to
a
*NL*
stone
table
.
His
arms
were
resting
on
the
table
,
and
his
brow
was
*NL*
bowed
down
on
them
,
the
blue
cloak
being
dragged
forward
and
screening
*NL*
his
face
on
each
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
exhausted
himself
last
night
,
''
Dorothea
said
to
herself
,
thinking
*NL*
at
first
that
he
was
asleep
,
and
that
the
summer-house
was
too
damp
a
*NL*
place
to
rest
in
.
But
then
she
remembered
that
of
late
she
had
seen
*NL*
him
take
that
attitude
when
she
was
reading
to
him
,
as
if
he
found
it
*NL*
easier
than
any
other
;
and
that
he
would
sometimes
speak
,
as
well
as
*NL*
listen
,
with
his
face
down
in
that
way
.
She
went
into
the
summerhouse
*NL*
and
said
,
``
I
am
come
,
Edward
;
I
am
ready
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
no
notice
,
and
she
thought
that
he
must
be
fast
asleep
.
She
*NL*
laid
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
,
and
repeated
,
``
I
am
ready
!
''
Still
he
was
*NL*
motionless
;
and
with
a
sudden
confused
fear
,
she
leaned
down
to
him
,
*NL*
took
off
his
velvet
cap
,
and
leaned
her
cheek
close
to
his
head
,
crying
*NL*
in
a
distressed
tone
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wake
,
dear
,
wake
!
Listen
to
me
.
I
am
come
to
answer
.
''
But
Dorothea
*NL*
never
gave
her
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
Later
in
the
day
,
Lydgate
was
seated
by
her
bedside
,
and
she
was
*NL*
talking
deliriously
,
thinking
aloud
,
and
recalling
what
had
gone
*NL*
through
her
mind
the
night
before
.
She
knew
him
,
and
called
him
by
his
*NL*
name
,
but
appeared
to
think
it
right
that
she
should
explain
everything
*NL*
to
him
;
and
again
,
and
again
,
begged
him
to
explain
everything
to
her
*NL*
husband
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
him
I
shall
go
to
him
soon
:
I
am
ready
to
promise
.
Only
,
*NL*
thinking
about
it
was
so
dreadful
--
it
has
made
me
ill
.
Not
very
ill
.
*NL*
I
shall
soon
be
better
.
Go
and
tell
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
silence
in
her
husband
's
ear
was
never
more
to
be
broken
.

A
task
too
strong
for
wizard
spells
*NL*
This
squire
had
brought
about
;
*NL*
'
T
is
easy
dropping
stones
in

But
who
shall
get
them
out
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
to
God
we
could
hinder
Dorothea
from
knowing
this
,
''
said
Sir
*NL*
James
Chettam
,
with
a
little
frown
on
his
brow
,
and
an
expression
of
*NL*
intense
disgust
about
his
mouth
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
standing
on
the
hearth-rug
in
the
library
at
Lowick
Grange
,
and
*NL*
speaking
to
Mr.
Brooke
.
It
was
the
day
after
Mr.
Casaubon
had
been
*NL*
buried
,
and
Dorothea
was
not
yet
able
to
leave
her
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
would
be
difficult
,
you
know
,
Chettam
,
as
she
is
an
executrix
,
*NL*
and
she
likes
to
go
into
these
things
--
property
,
land
,
that
kind
of
*NL*
thing
.
She
has
her
notions
,
you
know
,
''
said
Mr.
Brooke
,
sticking
his
*NL*
eye-glasses
on
nervously
,
and
exploring
the
edges
of
a
folded
paper
*NL*
which
he
held
in
his
hand
;
``
and
she
would
like
to
act
--
depend
upon
it
,
*NL*
as
an
executrix
Dorothea
would
want
to
act
.
And
she
was
twenty-one
*NL*
last
December
,
you
know
.
I
can
hinder
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
James
looked
at
the
carpet
for
a
minute
in
silence
,
and
then
*NL*
lifting
his
eyes
suddenly
fixed
them
on
Mr.
Brooke
,
saying
,
``
I
will
*NL*
tell
you
what
we
can
do
.
Until
Dorothea
is
well
,
all
business
must
be
*NL*
kept
from
her
,
and
as
soon
as
she
is
able
to
be
moved
she
must
come
to
*NL*
us
.
Being
with
Celia
and
the
baby
will
be
the
best
thing
in
the
world
*NL*
for
her
,
and
will
pass
away
the
time
.
And
meanwhile
you
must
get
rid
*NL*
of
Ladislaw
:
you
must
send
him
out
of
the
country
.
''
Here
Sir
James
's
*NL*
look
of
disgust
returned
in
all
its
intensity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Brooke
put
his
hands
behind
him
,
walked
to
the
window
and
*NL*
straightened
his
back
with
a
little
shake
before
he
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
easily
said
,
Chettam
,
easily
said
,
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
sir
,
''
persisted
Sir
James
,
restraining
his
indignation
within
*NL*
respectful
forms
,
``
it
was
you
who
brought
him
here
,
and
you
who
keep
*NL*
him
here
--
I
mean
by
the
occupation
you
give
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
I
ca
n't
dismiss
him
in
an
instant
without
assigning
reasons
,
*NL*
my
dear
Chettam
.
Ladislaw
has
been
invaluable
,
most
satisfactory
.
I
*NL*
consider
that
I
have
done
this
part
of
the
country
a
service
by
*NL*
bringing
him
--
by
bringing
him
,
you
know
.
''
Mr.
Brooke
ended
with
a
nod
,
*NL*
turning
round
to
give
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
pity
this
part
of
the
country
did
n't
do
without
him
,
that
's
all
*NL*
I
have
to
say
about
it
.
At
any
rate
,
as
Dorothea
's
brother-in-law
,
I
*NL*
feel
warranted
in
objecting
strongly
to
his
being
kept
here
by
any
*NL*
action
on
the
part
of
her
friends
.
You
admit
,
I
hope
,
that
I
have
a
*NL*
right
to
speak
about
what
concerns
the
dignity
of
my
wife
's
sister
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
James
was
getting
warm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
,
my
dear
Chettam
,
of
course

But
you
and
I
have
different

ideas

different
--

*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
about
this
action
of
Casaubon
's
,
I
should
hope
,
''
interrupted
Sir
*NL*
James
.
``
I
say
that
he
has
most
unfairly
compromised
Dorothea
.
I
say
*NL*
that
there
never
was
a
meaner
,
more
ungentlemanly
action
than
this
--
a
*NL*
codicil
of
this
sort
to
a
will
which
he
made
at
the
time
of
his
*NL*
marriage
with
the
knowledge
and
reliance
of
her
family
--
a
positive
*NL*
insult
to
Dorothea
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
know
,
Casaubon
was
a
little
twisted
about
Ladislaw
.
*NL*
Ladislaw
has
told
me
the
reason
--
dislike
of
the
bent
he
took
,
you
*NL*
know
--
Ladislaw
did
n't
think
much
of
Casaubon
's
notions
,
Thoth
and
*NL*
Dagon
--
that
sort
of
thing
:
and
I
fancy
that
Casaubon
did
n't
like
the
*NL*
independent
position
Ladislaw
had
taken
up
.
I
saw
the
letters
between
*NL*
them
,
you
know
.
Poor
Casaubon
was
a
little
buried
in
books
--
he
did
n't
*NL*
know
the
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
all
very
well
for
Ladislaw
to
put
that
color
on
it
,
''
said
Sir
*NL*
James
.
``
But
I
believe
Casaubon
was
only
jealous
of
him
on
Dorothea
's
*NL*
account
,
and
the
world
will
suppose
that
she
gave
him
some
reason
;
and
*NL*
that
is
what
makes
it
so
abominable
--
coupling
her
name
with
this
young
*NL*
fellow
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Chettam
,
it
wo
n't
lead
to
anything
,
you
know

said
Mr.
*NL*
Brooke
,
seating
himself
and
sticking
on
his
eye-glass
again
.
``
It
's
all
*NL*
of
a
piece

oddity

use

it
was
locked
up
*NL*
in
the
desk
with
the
will

I
suppose

meant
Dorothea
to
publish
his

researches

eh

she
'll
do
it

has
gone
into

studies
uncommonly

*NL*
``
My

said
Sir
James

impatiently
,
``
that

neither

there

the
propriety

sending

said
Mr
Brooke
,
becoming
acute
about
the
truths
that
*NL*
lay
on
the
side
of
his
own
wishes
.
``
I
might
get
rid
of
Ladislaw
up

a
certain
point

take
away
the
`
Pioneer

from
him

that
sort

thing

I
could
n't
send
him
out

*NL*
*NL*
Mr.

,
persisting
as
quietly
as
if
he
were
only
discussing
the
*NL*
nature
of
last
year
's
weather
,
and
nodding
at
the
end
with
his
usual
*NL*
amenity
,
was
an
exasperating
form
of
obstinacy

``

Sir

with

much
passion

he
ever

*NL*
Canterbury
Tales

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
had
been
safe
at
Freshitt
Hall
nearly
a
week
before
she
had
*NL*
asked
any
dangerous
questions
.
Every
morning
now
she
sat
with
Celia
in
*NL*
the
prettiest
of
up-stairs
sitting-rooms
,
opening
into
a
small
*NL*
conservatory
--
Celia
all
in
white
and
lavender
like
a
bunch
of
mixed
*NL*
violets
,
watching
the
remarkable
acts
of
the
baby
,
which
were
so
*NL*
dubious
to
her
inexperienced
mind
that
all
conversation
was
interrupted
*NL*
by
appeals
for
their
interpretation
made
to
the
oracular
nurse
.
*NL*
Dorothea
sat
by
in
her
widow
's
dress
,
with
an
expression
which
rather
*NL*
provoked
Celia
,
as
being
much
too
sad
;
for
not
only
was
baby
quite
*NL*
well
,
but
really
when
a
husband
had
been
so
dull
and
troublesome
while
*NL*
he
lived
,
and
besides
that
had
--
well
,
well
!
Sir
James
,
of
course
,
had
*NL*
told
Celia
everything
,
with
a
strong
representation
how
important
it
*NL*
was
that
Dorothea
should
not
know
it
sooner
than
was
inevitable
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Mr.
Brooke
had
been
right
in
predicting
that
Dorothea
would
not
*NL*
long
remain
passive
where
action
had
been
assigned
to
her
;
she
knew
the
*NL*
purport
of
her
husband
's
will
made
at
the
time
of
their
marriage
,
and
*NL*
her
mind
,
as
soon
as
she
was
clearly
conscious
of
her
position
,
was
*NL*
silently
occupied
with
what
she
ought
to
do
as
the
owner
of
Lowick
*NL*
Manor
with
the
patronage
of
the
living
attached
to
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
morning
when
her
uncle
paid
his
usual
visit
,
though
with
an
unusual
*NL*
alacrity
in
his
manner
which
he
accounted
for
by
saying
that
it
was
now
*NL*
pretty
certain
Parliament
would
be
dissolved
forthwith
,
Dorothea
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Uncle
,
it
is
right
now
that
I
should
consider
who
is
to
have
the
*NL*
living
at
Lowick
.
After
Mr.
Tucker
had
been
provided
for
,
I
never
*NL*
heard
my
husband
say
that
he
had
any
clergyman
in
his
mind
as
a
*NL*
successor
to
himself
.
I
think
I
ought
to
have
the
keys
now
and
go
to
*NL*
Lowick
to
examine
all
my
husband
's
papers
.
There
may
be
something
that
*NL*
would
throw
light
on
his
wishes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
hurry
,
my
dear
,
''
said
Mr.
Brooke
,
quietly
.
``
By-and-by
,
you
know
,
*NL*
you
can
go
,
if
you
like
.
But
I
cast
my
eyes
over
things
in
the
desks
*NL*
and
drawers
--
there
was
nothing
--
nothing
but
deep
subjects
,
you
*NL*
know
--
besides
the
will
.
Everything
can
be
done
by-and-by
.
As
to
the
*NL*
living
,
I
have
had
an
application
for
interest
already
--
I
should
say
*NL*
rather
good
.
Mr.
Tyke
has
been
strongly
recommended
to
me
--
I
had
*NL*
something
to
do
with
getting
him
an
appointment
before
.
An
apostolic
*NL*
man
,
I
believe
--
the
sort
of
thing
that
would
suit
you
,
my
dear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
like
to
have
fuller
knowledge
about
him
,
uncle
,
and
judge
for
*NL*
myself
,
if
Mr.
Casaubon
has
not
left
any
expression
of
his
wishes
.
He
*NL*
has
perhaps
made
some
addition
to
his
will
--
there
may
be
some
*NL*
instructions
for
me
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
who
had
all
the
while
had
this
*NL*
conjecture
in
her
mind
with
relation
to
her
husband
's
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
about
the
rectory
,
my
dear
--
nothing
,
''
said
Mr.
Brooke
,
rising
*NL*
to
go
away
,
and
putting
out
his
hand
to
his
nieces
:
``
nor
about
his
*NL*
researches
,
you
know
.
Nothing
in
the
will
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
's
lip
quivered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
you
must
not
think
of
these
things
yet
,
my
dear
.
By-and-by
,
you
*NL*
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
quite
well
now
,
uncle
;
I
wish
to
exert
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
well
,
we
shall
see
.
But
I
must
run
away
now
--
I
have
no
end
of
*NL*
work
now
--
it
's
a
crisis
--
a
political
crisis
,
you
know
.
And
here
is
*NL*
Celia
and
her
little
man
--
you
are
an
aunt
,
you
know
,
now
,
and
I
am
a
*NL*
sort
of
grandfather
,
''
said
Mr.
Brooke
,
with
placid
hurry
,
anxious
to
*NL*
get
away
and
tell
Chettam
that
it
would
not
be
his
-LRB-
Mr.
Brooke
's
-RRB-
fault
*NL*
if
Dorothea
insisted
on
looking
into
everything
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
sank
back
in
her
chair
when
her
uncle
had
left
the
room
,
and
*NL*
cast
her
eyes
down
meditatively
on
her
crossed
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
,
Dodo
!
look
at
him
!
Did
you
ever
see
anything
like
that
?
''
said
*NL*
Celia
,
in
her
comfortable
staccato
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
Kitty
?
''
said
Dorothea
,
lifting
her
eyes
rather
absently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
why
,
his
upper
lip
;
see
how
he
is
drawing
it
down
,
as
if
he
*NL*
meant
to
make
a
face
.
Is
n't
it
wonderful
!
He
may
have
his
little
*NL*
thoughts
.
I
wish
nurse
were
here
.
Do
look
at
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
large
tear
which
had
been
for
some
time
gathering
,
rolled
down
*NL*
Dorothea
's
cheek
as
she
looked
up
and
tried
to
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
be
sad
,
Dodo
;
kiss
baby
.
What
are
you
brooding
over
so
?
I
am
*NL*
sure
you
did
everything
,
and
a
great
deal
too
much
.
You
should
be
*NL*
happy
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wonder
if
Sir
James
would
drive
me
to
Lowick
.
I
want
to
look
over
*NL*
everything
--
to
see
if
there
were
any
words
written
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
not
to
go
till
Mr.
Lydgate
says
you
may
go
.
And
he
has
not
*NL*
said
so
yet
-LRB-
here
you
are
,
nurse
;
take
baby
and
walk
up
and
down
the
*NL*
gallery
-RRB-
.
Besides
,
you
have
got
a
wrong
notion
in
your
head
as
usual
,
*NL*
Dodo
--
I
can
see
that
:
it
vexes
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
am
I
wrong
,
Kitty
?
''
said
Dorothea
,
quite
meekly
.
She
was
almost
*NL*
ready
now
to
think
Celia
wiser
than
herself
,
and
was
really
wondering
*NL*
with
some
fear
what
her
wrong
notion
was
.
Celia
felt
her
advantage
,
*NL*
and
was
determined
to
use
it
.
None
of
them
knew
Dodo
as
well
as
she
*NL*
did
,
or
knew
how
to
manage
her
.
Since
Celia
's
baby
was
born
,
she
had
*NL*
had
a
new
sense
of
her
mental
solidity
and
calm
wisdom
.
It
seemed
*NL*
clear
that
where
there
was
a
baby
,
things
were
right
enough
,
and
that
*NL*
error
,
in
general
,
was
a
mere
lack
of
that
central
poising
force
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
see
what
you
are
thinking
of
as
well
as
can
be
,
Dodo
,
''
said
*NL*
Celia
.
``
You
are
wanting
to
find
out
if
there
is
anything
uncomfortable
*NL*
for
you
to
do
now
,
only
because
Mr.
Casaubon
wished
it
.
As
if
you
had
*NL*
not
been
uncomfortable
enough
before
.
And
he
does
n't
deserve
it
,
and
*NL*
you
will
find
that
out
.
He
has
behaved
very
badly
.
James
is
as
angry
*NL*
with
him
as
can
be
.
And
I
had
better
tell
you
,
to
prepare
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Celia
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
entreatingly
,
``
you
distress
me
.
Tell
me
at
*NL*
once
what
you
mean
.
''
It
glanced
through
her
mind
that
Mr.
Casaubon
*NL*
had
left
the
property
away
from
her
--
which
would
not
be
so
very
*NL*
distressing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
he
has
made
a
codicil
to
his
will
,
to
say
the
property
was
all
to
*NL*
go
away
from
you
if
you
married
--
I
mean
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
of
no
consequence
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
breaking
in
impetuously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
if
you
married
Mr.
Ladislaw
,
not
anybody
else
,
''
Celia
went
on
with
*NL*
persevering
quietude
.
``
Of
course
that
is
of
no
consequence
in
one
*NL*
way
--
you
never
_
would
_
marry
Mr.
Ladislaw
;
but
that
only
makes
it
worse
*NL*
of
Mr.
Casaubon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
blood
rushed
to
Dorothea
's
face
and
neck
painfully
.
But
Celia
was
*NL*
administering
what
she
thought
a
sobering
dose
of
fact
.
It
was
taking
*NL*
up
notions
that
had
done
Dodo
's
health
so
much
harm
.
So
she
went
on
in
*NL*
her
neutral
tone
,
as
if
she
had
been
remarking
on
baby
's
robes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
James
says
so
.
He
says
it
is
abominable
,
and
not
like
a
gentleman
.
*NL*
And
there
never
was
a
better
judge
than
James
.
It
is
as
if
Mr.
*NL*
Casaubon
wanted
to
make
people
believe
that
you
would
wish
to
marry
Mr.
*NL*
Ladislaw
--
which
is
ridiculous
.
Only
James
says
it
was
to
hinder
Mr.
*NL*
Ladislaw
from
wanting
to
marry
you
for
your
money
--
just
as
if
he
ever
*NL*
would
think
of
making
you
an
offer
.
Mrs.
Cadwallader
said
you
might
as
*NL*
well
marry
an
Italian
with
white
mice
!
But
I
must
just
go
and
look
at
*NL*
baby
,
''
Celia
added
,
without
the
least
change
of
tone
,
throwing
a
light
*NL*
shawl
over
her
,
and
tripping
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
by
this
time
had
turned
cold
again
,
and
now
threw
herself
back
*NL*
helplessly
in
her
chair
.
She
might
have
compared
her
experience
at
*NL*
that
moment
to
the
vague
,
alarmed
consciousness
that
her
life
was
*NL*
taking
on
a
new
form
,
that
she
was
undergoing
a
metamorphosis
in
which
*NL*
memory
would
not
adjust
itself
to
the
stirring
of
new
organs
.
*NL*
Everything
was
changing
its
aspect
:
her
husband
's
conduct
,
her
own
*NL*
duteous
feeling
towards
him
,
every
struggle
between
them
--
and
yet
*NL*
more
,
her
whole
relation
to
Will
Ladislaw
.
Her
world
was
in
a
state
of
*NL*
convulsive
change
;
the
only
thing
she
could
say
distinctly
to
herself
*NL*
was
,
that
she
must
wait
and
think
anew
.
One
change
terrified
her
as
if
*NL*
it
had
been
a
sin
;
it
was
a
violent
shock
of
repulsion
from
her
*NL*
departed
husband
,
who
had
had
hidden
thoughts
,
perhaps
perverting
*NL*
everything
she
said
and
did
.
Then
again
she
was
conscious
of
another
*NL*
change
which
also
made
her
tremulous
;
it
was
a
sudden
strange
yearning
*NL*
of
heart
towards
Will
Ladislaw
.
It
had
never
before
entered
her
mind
*NL*
that
he
could
,
under
any
circumstances
,
be
her
lover
:
conceive
the
*NL*
effect
of
the
sudden
revelation
that
another
had
thought
of
him
in
that
*NL*
light
--
that
perhaps
he
himself
had
been
conscious
of
such
a
*NL*
possibility
,
--
and
this
with
the
hurrying
,
crowding
vision
of
unfitting
*NL*
conditions
,
and
questions
not
soon
to
be
solved
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
seemed
a
long
while
--
she
did
not
know
how
long
--
before
she
heard
*NL*
Celia
saying
,
``
That
will
do
,
nurse
;
he
will
be
quiet
on
my
lap
now
.
*NL*
You
can
go
to
lunch
,
and
let
Garratt
stay
in
the
next
room
.
''
``
What
I
*NL*
think
,
Dodo
,
''
Celia
went
on
,
observing
nothing
more
than
that
Dorothea
*NL*
was
leaning
back
in
her
chair
,
and
likely
to
be
passive
,
``
is
that
Mr.
*NL*
Casaubon
was
spiteful
.
I
never
did
like
him
,
and
James
never
did
.
I
*NL*
think
the
corners
of
his
mouth
were
dreadfully
spiteful
.
And
now
he
*NL*
has
behaved
in
this
way
,
I
am
sure
religion
does
not
require
you
to
*NL*
make
yourself
uncomfortable
about
him
.
If
he
has
been
taken
away
,
that
*NL*
is
a
mercy
,
and
you
ought
to
be
grateful
.
We
should
not
grieve
,
should
*NL*
we
,
baby
?
''
said
Celia
confidentially
to
that
unconscious
centre
and
*NL*
poise
of
the
world
,
who
had
the
most
remarkable
fists
all
complete
even
*NL*
to
the
nails
,
and
hair
enough
,
really
,
when
you
took
his
cap
off
,
to
*NL*
make
--
you
did
n't
know
what
:
--
in
short
,
he
was
Bouddha
in
a
Western
*NL*
form
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
crisis
Lydgate
was
announced
,
and
one
of
the
first
things
he
*NL*
said
was
,
``
I
fear
you
are
not
so
well
as
you
were
,
Mrs.
Casaubon
;
have
*NL*
you
been
agitated
?
allow
me
to
feel
your
pulse
.
''
Dorothea
's
hand
was
*NL*
of
a
marble
coldness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
wants
to
go
to
Lowick
,
to
look
over
papers
,
''
said
Celia
.
``
She
*NL*
ought
not
,
ought
she
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lydgate
did
not
speak
for
a
few
moments
.
Then
he
said
,
looking
at
*NL*
Dorothea
.
``
I
hardly
know
.
In
my
opinion
Mrs.
Casaubon
should
do
what
*NL*
would
give
her
the
most
repose
of
mind
.
That
repose
will
not
always
*NL*
come
from
being
forbidden
to
act
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
exerting
herself
,
``
I
am
sure
that
is
wise
.
*NL*
There
are
so
many
things
which
I
ought
to
attend
to
.
Why
should
I
sit
*NL*
here
idle
?
''
Then
,
with
an
effort
to
recall
subjects
not
connected
with
*NL*
her
agitation
,
she
added
,
abruptly
,
``
You
know
every
one
in
Middlemarch
,
*NL*
I
think
,
Mr.
Lydgate
.
I
shall
ask
you
to
tell
me
a
great
deal
.
I
have
*NL*
serious
things
to
do
now
.
I
have
a
living
to
give
away
.
You
know
Mr.
*NL*
Tyke
and
all
the
--
''
But
Dorothea
's
effort
was
too
much
for
her
;
she
*NL*
broke
off
and
burst
into
sobs
.
Lydgate
made
her
drink
a
dose
of
sal
*NL*
volatile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
Mrs.
Casaubon
do
as
she
likes
,
''
he
said
to
Sir
James
,
whom
he
*NL*
asked
to
see
before
quitting
the
house
.
``
She
wants
perfect
freedom
,
I
*NL*
think
,
more
than
any
other
prescription
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
attendance
on
Dorothea
while
her
brain
was
excited
,
had
enabled
him
*NL*
to
form
some
true
conclusions
concerning
the
trials
of
her
life
.
He
*NL*
felt
sure
that
she
had
been
suffering
from
the
strain
and
conflict
of
*NL*
self-repression
;
and
that
she
was
likely
now
to
feel
herself
only
in
*NL*
another
sort
of
pinfold
than
that
from
which
she
had
been
released
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lydgate
's
advice
was
all
the
easier
for
Sir
James
to
follow
when
he
*NL*
found
that
Celia
had
already
told
Dorothea
the
unpleasant
fact
about
*NL*
the
will
.
There
was
no
help
for
it
now
--
no
reason
for
any
further
*NL*
delay
in
the
execution
of
necessary
business
.
And
the
next
day
Sir
*NL*
James
complied
at
once
with
her
request
that
he
would
drive
her
to
*NL*
Lowick
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
no
wish
to
stay
there
at
present
,
''
said
Dorothea
;
``
I
could
*NL*
hardly
bear
it
.
I
am
much
happier
at
Freshitt
with
Celia
.
I
shall
be
*NL*
able
to
think
better
about
what
should
be
done
at
Lowick
by
looking
at
*NL*
it
from
a
distance
.
And
I
should
like
to
be
at
the
Grange
a
little
*NL*
while
with
my
uncle
,
and
go
about
in
all
the
old
walks
and
among
the
*NL*
people
in
the
village
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
yet
,
I
think
.
Your
uncle
is
having
political
company
,
and
you
are
*NL*
better
out
of
the
way
of
such
doings
,
''
said
Sir
James
,
who
at
that
*NL*
moment
thought
of
the
Grange
chiefly
as
a
haunt
of
young
Ladislaw
's
.
*NL*
But
no
word
passed
between
him
and
Dorothea
about
the
objectionable
*NL*
part
of
the
will
;
indeed
,
both
of
them
felt
that
the
mention
of
it
*NL*
between
them
would
be
impossible
.
Sir
James
was
shy
,
even
with
men
,
*NL*
about
disagreeable
subjects
;
and
the
one
thing
that
Dorothea
would
have
*NL*
chosen
to
say
,
if
she
had
spoken
on
the
matter
at
all
,
was
forbidden
to
*NL*
her
at
present
because
it
seemed
to
be
a
further
exposure
of
her
*NL*
husband
's
injustice
.
Yet
she
did
wish
that
Sir
James
could
know
what
*NL*
had
passed
between
her
and
her
husband
about
Will
Ladislaw
's
moral
*NL*
claim
on
the
property
:
it
would
then
,
she
thought
,
be
apparent
to
him
*NL*
as
it
was
to
her
,
that
her
husband
's
strange
indelicate
proviso
had
*NL*
been
chiefly
urged
by
his
bitter
resistance
to
that
idea
of
claim
,
and
*NL*
not
merely
by
personal
feelings
more
difficult
to
talk
about
.
Also
,
it
*NL*
must
be
admitted
,
Dorothea
wished
that
this
could
be
known
for
Will
's
*NL*
sake
,
since
her
friends
seemed
to
think
of
him
as
simply
an
object
of
*NL*
Mr.
Casaubon
's
charity
.
Why
should
he
be
compared
with
an
Italian
*NL*
carrying
white
mice
?
That
word
quoted
from
Mrs.
Cadwallader
seemed
*NL*
like
a
mocking
travesty
wrought
in
the
dark
by
an
impish
finger
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
Lowick
Dorothea
searched
desk
and
drawer
--
searched
all
her
husband
's
*NL*
places
of
deposit
for
private
writing
,
but
found
no
paper
addressed
*NL*
especially
to
her
,
except
that
``
Synoptical
Tabulation
,
''
which
was
*NL*
probably
only
the
beginning
of
many
intended
directions
for
her
*NL*
guidance
.
In
carrying
out
this
bequest
of
labor
to
Dorothea
,
as
in
all
*NL*
else
,
Mr.
Casaubon
had
been
slow
and
hesitating
,
oppressed
in
the
plan
*NL*
of
transmitting
his
work
,
as
he
had
been
in
executing
it
,
by
the
sense
*NL*
of
moving
heavily
in
a
dim
and
clogging
medium
:
distrust
of
Dorothea
's
*NL*
competence
to
arrange
what
he
had
prepared
was
subdued
only
by
distrust
*NL*
of
any
other
redactor
.
But
he
had
come
at
last
to
create
a
trust
for
*NL*
himself
out
of
Dorothea
's
nature
:
she
could
do
what
she
resolved
to
do
:
*NL*
and
he
willingly
imagined
her
toiling
under
the
fetters
of
a
promise
to
*NL*
erect
a
tomb
with
his
name
upon
it
.
-LRB-
Not
that
Mr.
Casaubon
called
the
*NL*
future
volumes
a
tomb
;
he
called
them
the
Key
to
all
Mythologies
.
-RRB-
But
*NL*
the
months
gained
on
him
and
left
his
plans
belated
:
he
had
only
had
*NL*
time
to
ask
for
that
promise
by
which
he
sought
to
keep
his
cold
grasp
*NL*
on
Dorothea
's
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
grasp
had
slipped
away
.
Bound
by
a
pledge
given
from
the
depths
of
*NL*
her
pity
,
she
would
have
been
capable
of
undertaking
a
toil
which
her
*NL*
judgment
whispered
was
vain
for
all
uses
except
that
consecration
of
*NL*
faithfulness
which
is
a
supreme
use
.
But
now
her
judgment
,
instead
of
*NL*
being
controlled
by
duteous
devotion
,
was
made
active
by
the
*NL*
imbittering
discovery
that
in
her
past
union
there
had
lurked
the
*NL*
hidden
alienation
of
secrecy
and
suspicion
.
The
living
,
suffering
man
*NL*
was
no
longer
before
her
to
awaken
her
pity
:
there
remained
only
the
*NL*
retrospect
of
painful
subjection
to
a
husband
whose
thoughts
had
been
*NL*
lower
than
she
had
believed
,
whose
exorbitant
claims
for
himself
had
*NL*
even
blinded
his
scrupulous
care
for
his
own
character
,
and
made
him
*NL*
defeat
his
own
pride
by
shocking
men
of
ordinary
honor
.
As
for
the
*NL*
property
which
was
the
sign
of
that
broken
tie
,
she
would
have
been
*NL*
glad
to
be
free
from
it
and
have
nothing
more
than
her
original
fortune
*NL*
which
had
been
settled
on
her
,
if
there
had
not
been
duties
attached
to
*NL*
ownership
,
which
she
ought
not
to
flinch
from
.
About
this
property
*NL*
many
troublous
questions
insisted
on
rising
:
had
she
not
been
right
in
*NL*
thinking
that
the
half
of
it
ought
to
go
to
Will
Ladislaw
?
--
but
was
it
*NL*
not
impossible
now
for
her
to
do
that
act
of
justice
?
Mr.
Casaubon
had
*NL*
taken
a
cruelly
effective
means
of
hindering
her
:
even
with
indignation
*NL*
against
him
in
her
heart
,
any
act
that
seemed
a
triumphant
eluding
of
*NL*
his
purpose
revolted
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
collecting
papers
of
business
which
she
wished
to
examine
,
she
*NL*
locked
up
again
the
desks
and
drawers
--
all
empty
of
personal
words
for
*NL*
her
--
empty
of
any
sign
that
in
her
husband
's
lonely
brooding
his
heart
*NL*
had
gone
out
to
her
in
excuse
or
explanation
;
and
she
went
back
to
*NL*
Freshitt
with
the
sense
that
around
his
last
hard
demand
and
his
last
*NL*
injurious
assertion
of
his
power
,
the
silence
was
unbroken
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
tried
now
to
turn
her
thoughts
towards
immediate
duties
,
and
*NL*
one
of
these
was
of
a
kind
which
others
were
determined
to
remind
her
*NL*
of
.
Lydgate
's
ear
had
caught
eagerly
her
mention
of
the
living
,
and
as
*NL*
soon
as
he
could
,
he
reopened
the
subject
,
seeing
here
a
possibility
of
*NL*
making
amends
for
the
casting-vote
he
had
once
given
with
an
*NL*
ill-satisfied
conscience
.
``
Instead
of
telling
you
anything
about
Mr.
*NL*
Tyke
,
''
he
said
,
``
I
should
like
to
speak
of
another
man
--
Mr.
*NL*
Farebrother
,
the
Vicar
of
St.
Botolph
's
.
His
living
is
a
poor
one
,
and
*NL*
gives
him
a
stinted
provision
for
himself
and
his
family
.
His
mother
,
*NL*
aunt
,
and
sister
all
live
with
him
,
and
depend
upon
him
.
I
believe
he
*NL*
has
never
married
because
of
them
.
I
never
heard
such
good
preaching
*NL*
as
his
--
such
plain
,
easy
eloquence
.
He
would
have
done
to
preach
at
*NL*
St.
Paul
's
Cross
after
old
Latimer
.
His
talk
is
just
as
good
about
all
*NL*
subjects
:
original
,
simple
,
clear
.
I
think
him
a
remarkable
fellow
:
he
*NL*
ought
to
have
done
more
than
he
has
done
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
has
he
not
done
more
?
''
said
Dorothea
,
interested
now
in
all
who
*NL*
had
slipped
below
their
own
intention
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
a
hard
question
,
''
said
Lydgate
.
``
I
find
myself
that
it
's
*NL*
uncommonly
difficult
to
make
the
right
thing
work
:
there
are
so
many
*NL*
strings
pulling
at
once
.
Farebrother
often
hints
that
he
has
got
into
*NL*
the
wrong
profession
;
he
wants
a
wider
range
than
that
of
a
poor
*NL*
clergyman
,
and
I
suppose
he
has
no
interest
to
help
him
on
.
He
is
very
*NL*
fond
of
Natural
History
and
various
scientific
matters
,
and
he
is
*NL*
hampered
in
reconciling
these
tastes
with
his
position
.
He
has
no
*NL*
money
to
spare
--
hardly
enough
to
use
;
and
that
has
led
him
into
*NL*
card-playing
--
Middlemarch
is
a
great
place
for
whist
.
He
does
play
for
*NL*
money
,
and
he
wins
a
good
deal
.
Of
course
that
takes
him
into
company
*NL*
a
little
beneath
him
,
and
makes
him
slack
about
some
things
;
and
yet
,
*NL*
with
all
that
,
looking
at
him
as
a
whole
,
I
think
he
is
one
of
the
most
*NL*
blameless
men
I
ever
knew
.
He
has
neither
venom
nor
doubleness
in
him
,
*NL*
and
those
often
go
with
a
more
correct
outside
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wonder
whether
he
suffers
in
his
conscience
because
of
that
habit
,
''
*NL*
said
Dorothea
;
``
I
wonder
whether
he
wishes
he
could
leave
it
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
no
doubt
he
would
leave
it
off
,
if
he
were
transplanted
into
*NL*
plenty
:
he
would
be
glad
of
the
time
for
other
things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
uncle
says
that
Mr.
Tyke
is
spoken
of
as
an
apostolic
man
,
''
said
*NL*
Dorothea
,
meditatively
.
She
was
wishing
it
were
possible
to
restore
*NL*
the
times
of
primitive
zeal
,
and
yet
thinking
of
Mr.
Farebrother
with
a
*NL*
strong
desire
to
rescue
him
from
his
chance-gotten
money
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
pretend
to
say
that
Farebrother
is
apostolic
,
''
said
Lydgate
.
*NL*
``
His
position
is
not
quite
like
that
of
the
Apostles
:
he
is
only
a
*NL*
parson
among
parishioners
whose
lives
he
has
to
try
and
make
better
.
*NL*
Practically
I
find
that
what
is
called
being
apostolic
now
,
is
an
*NL*
impatience
of
everything
in
which
the
parson
does
n't
cut
the
principal
*NL*
figure
.
I
see
something
of
that
in
Mr.
Tyke
at
the
Hospital
:
a
good
*NL*
deal
of
his
doctrine
is
a
sort
of
pinching
hard
to
make
people
*NL*
uncomfortably
aware
of
him
.
Besides
,
an
apostolic
man
at
Lowick
!
--
he
*NL*
ought
to
think
,
as
St.
Francis
did
,
that
it
is
needful
to
preach
to
the
*NL*
birds
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
True
,
''
said
Dorothea
.
``
It
is
hard
to
imagine
what
sort
of
notions
our
*NL*
farmers
and
laborers
get
from
their
teaching
.
I
have
been
looking
into
*NL*
a
volume
of
sermons
by
Mr.
Tyke
:
such
sermons
would
be
of
no
use
at
*NL*
Lowick
--
I
mean
,
about
imputed
righteousness
and
the
prophecies
in
the
*NL*
Apocalypse
.
I
have
always
been
thinking
of
the
different
ways
in
which
*NL*
Christianity
is
taught
,
and
whenever
I
find
one
way
that
makes
it
a
*NL*
wider
blessing
than
any
other
,
I
cling
to
that
as
the
truest
--
I
mean
*NL*
that
which
takes
in
the
most
good
of
all
kinds
,
and
brings
in
the
most
*NL*
people
as
sharers
in
it
.
It
is
surely
better
to
pardon
too
much
,
than
*NL*
to
condemn
too
much
.
But
I
should
like
to
see
Mr.
Farebrother
and
hear
*NL*
him
preach
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
,
''
said
Lydgate
;
``
I
trust
to
the
effect
of
that
.
He
is
very
much
*NL*
beloved
,
but
he
has
his
enemies
too
:
there
are
always
people
who
ca
n't
*NL*
forgive
an
able
man
for
differing
from
them
.
And
that
money-winning
*NL*
business
is
really
a
blot
.
You
do
n't
,
of
course
,
see
many
Middlemarch
*NL*
people
:
but
Mr.
Ladislaw
,
who
is
constantly
seeing
Mr.
Brooke
,
is
a
*NL*
great
friend
of
Mr.
Farebrother
's
old
ladies
,
and
would
be
glad
to
sing
*NL*
the
Vicar
's
praises
.
One
of
the
old
ladies
--
Miss
Noble
,
the
aunt
--
is
a
*NL*
wonderfully
quaint
picture
of
self-forgetful
goodness
,
and
Ladislaw
*NL*
gallants
her
about
sometimes
.
I
met
them
one
day
in
a
back
street
:
you
*NL*
know
Ladislaw
's
look
--
a
sort
of
Daphnis
in
coat
and
waistcoat
;
and
this
*NL*
little
old
maid
reaching
up
to
his
arm
--
they
looked
like
a
couple
*NL*
dropped
out
of
a
romantic
comedy
.
But
the
best
evidence
about
*NL*
Farebrother
is
to
see
him
and
hear
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Happily
Dorothea
was
in
her
private
sitting-room
when
this
conversation
*NL*
occurred
,
and
there
was
no
one
present
to
make
Lydgate
's
innocent
*NL*
introduction
of
Ladislaw
painful
to
her
.
As
was
usual
with
him
in
*NL*
matters
of
personal
gossip
,
Lydgate
had
quite
forgotten
Rosamond
's
*NL*
remark
that
she
thought
Will
adored
Mrs.
Casaubon
.
At
that
moment
he
*NL*
was
only
caring
for
what
would
recommend
the
Farebrother
family
;
and
he
*NL*
had
purposely
given
emphasis
to
the
worst
that
could
be
said
about
the
*NL*
Vicar
,
in
order
to
forestall
objections
.
In
the
weeks
since
Mr.
*NL*
Casaubon
's
death
he
had
hardly
seen
Ladislaw
,
and
he
had
heard
no
rumor
*NL*
to
warn
him
that
Mr.
Brooke
's
confidential
secretary
was
a
dangerous
*NL*
subject
with
Mrs.
Casaubon
.
When
he
was
gone
,
his
picture
of
Ladislaw
*NL*
lingered
in
her
mind
and
disputed
the
ground
with
that
question
of
the
*NL*
Lowick
living
.
What
was
Will
Ladislaw
thinking
about
her
?
Would
he
*NL*
hear
of
that
fact
which
made
her
cheeks
burn
as
they
never
used
to
do
?
*NL*
And
how
would
he
feel
when
he
heard
it
?
--
But
she
could
see
as
well
as
*NL*
possible
how
he
smiled
down
at
the
little
old
maid
.
An
Italian
with
*NL*
white
mice
!
--
on
the
contrary
,
he
was
a
creature
who
entered
into
every
*NL*
one
's
feelings
,
and
could
take
the
pressure
of
their
thought
instead
of
*NL*
urging
his
own
with
iron
resistance
.

CHAPTER
LI
.
*NL*
*NL*
Party
is
Nature
too
,
and
you
shall
see
*NL*
By
force
of
Logic
how
they
both
agree
:
*NL*
The
Many
in
the
One
,
the
One
in
Many
;
*NL*
All
is
not
Some
,
nor
Some
the
same
as
Any
:
*NL*
Genus
holds
species
,
both
are
great
or
small
;
*NL*
One
genus
highest
,
one
not
high
at
all
;
*NL*
Each
species
has
its
differentia
too
,
*NL*
This
is
not
That
,
and
He
was
never
You
,
*NL*
Though
this
and
that
are
AYES
,
and
you
and
he
*NL*
Are
like
as
one
to
one
,
or
three
to
three
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
No
gossip
about
Mr.
Casaubon
's
will
had
yet
reached
Ladislaw
:
the
air
*NL*
seemed
to
be
filled
with
the
dissolution
of
Parliament
and
the
coming
*NL*
election
,
as
the
old
wakes
and
fairs
were
filled
with
the
rival
clatter
*NL*
of
itinerant
shows
;
and
more
private
noises
were
taken
little
notice
*NL*
of
.
The
famous
``
dry
election
''
was
at
hand
,
in
which
the
depths
of
*NL*
public
feeling
might
be
measured
by
the
low
flood-mark
of
drink
.
Will
*NL*
Ladislaw
was
one
of
the
busiest
at
this
time
;
and
though
Dorothea
's
*NL*
widowhood
was
continually
in
his
thought
,
he
was
so
far
from
wishing
to
*NL*
be
spoken
to
on
the
subject
,
that
when
Lydgate
sought
him
out
to
tell
*NL*
him
what
had
passed
about
the
Lowick
living
,
he
answered
rather
*NL*
waspishly
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
should
you
bring
me
into
the
matter
?
I
never
see
Mrs.
Casaubon
,
*NL*
and
am
not
likely
to
see
her
,
since
she
is
at
Freshitt
.
I
never
go
*NL*
there
.
It
is
Tory
ground
,
where
I
and
the
`
Pioneer
'
are
no
more
*NL*
welcome
than
a
poacher
and
his
gun
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
fact
was
that
Will
had
been
made
the
more
susceptible
by
observing
*NL*
that
Mr.
Brooke
,
instead
of
wishing
him
,
as
before
,
to
come
to
the
*NL*
Grange
oftener
than
was
quite
agreeable
to
himself
,
seemed
now
to
*NL*
contrive
that
he
should
go
there
as
little
as
possible
.
This
was
a
*NL*
shuffling
concession
of
Mr.
Brooke
's
to
Sir
James
Chettam
's
indignant
*NL*
remonstrance
;
and
Will
,
awake
to
the
slightest
hint
in
this
direction
,
*NL*
concluded
that
he
was
to
be
kept
away
from
the
Grange
on
Dorothea
's
*NL*
account
.
Her
friends
,
then
,
regarded
him
with
some
suspicion
?
Their
*NL*
fears
were
quite
superfluous
:
they
were
very
much
mistaken
if
they
*NL*
imagined
that
he
would
put
himself
forward
as
a
needy
adventurer
trying
*NL*
to
win
the
favor
of
a
rich
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
Until
now
Will
had
never
fully
seen
the
chasm
between
himself
and
*NL*
Dorothea
--
until
now
that
he
was
come
to
the
brink
of
it
,
and
saw
her
on
*NL*
the
other
side
.
He
began
,
not
without
some
inward
rage
,
to
think
of
*NL*
going
away
from
the
neighborhood
:
it
would
be
impossible
for
him
to
*NL*
show
any
further
interest
in
Dorothea
without
subjecting
himself
to
*NL*
disagreeable
imputations
--
perhaps
even
in
her
mind
,
which
others
might
*NL*
try
to
poison
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
forever
divided
,
''
said
Will
.
``
I
might
as
well
be
at
Rome
;
she
*NL*
would
be
no
farther
from
me
.
''
But
what
we
call
our
despair
is
often
*NL*
only
the
painful
eagerness
of
unfed
hope
.
There
were
plenty
of
reasons
*NL*
why
he
should
not
go
--
public
reasons
why
he
should
not
quit
his
post
at
*NL*
this
crisis
,
leaving
Mr.
Brooke
in
the
lurch
when
he
needed
``
coaching
''
*NL*
for
the
election
,
and
when
there
was
so
much
canvassing
,
direct
and
*NL*
indirect
,
to
be
carried
on
.
Will
could
not
like
to
leave
his
own
*NL*
chessmen
in
the
heat
of
a
game
;
and
any
candidate
on
the
right
side
,
*NL*
even
if
his
brain
and
marrow
had
been
as
soft
as
was
consistent
with
a
*NL*
gentlemanly
bearing
,
might
help
to
turn
a
majority
.
To
coach
Mr.
*NL*
Brooke
and
keep
him
steadily
to
the
idea
that
he
must
pledge
himself
to
*NL*
vote
for
the
actual
Reform
Bill
,
instead
of
insisting
on
his
*NL*
independence
and
power
of
pulling
up
in
time
,
was
not
an
easy
task
.
*NL*
Mr.
Farebrother
's
prophecy
of
a
fourth
candidate
``
in
the
bag
''
had
not
*NL*
yet
been
fulfilled
,
neither
the
Parliamentary
Candidate
Society
nor
any
*NL*
other
power
on
the
watch
to
secure
a
reforming
majority
seeing
a
worthy
*NL*
nodus
for
interference
while
there
was
a
second
reforming
candidate
*NL*
like
Mr.
Brooke
,
who
might
be
returned
at
his
own
expense
;
and
the
*NL*
fight
lay
entirely
between
Pinkerton
the
old
Tory
member
,
Bagster
the
*NL*
new
Whig
member
returned
at
the
last
election
,
and
Brooke
the
future
*NL*
independent
member
,
who
was
to
fetter
himself
for
this
occasion
only
.
*NL*
Mr.
Hawley
and
his
party
would
bend
all
their
forces
to
the
return
of
*NL*
Pinkerton
,
and
Mr.
Brooke
's
success
must
depend
either
on
plumpers
*NL*
which
would
leave
Bagster
in
the
rear
,
or
on
the
new
minting
of
Tory
*NL*
votes
into
reforming
votes
.
The
latter
means
,
of
course
,
would
be
*NL*
preferable
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
prospect
of
converting
votes
was
a
dangerous
distraction
to
Mr.
*NL*
Brooke
:
his
impression
that
waverers
were
likely
to
be
allured
by
*NL*
wavering
statements
,
and
also
the
liability
of
his
mind
to
stick
afresh
*NL*
at
opposing
arguments
as
they
turned
up
in
his
memory
,
gave
Will
*NL*
Ladislaw
much
trouble
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
there
are
tactics
in
these
things
,
''
said
Mr.
Brooke
;
``
meeting
*NL*
people
half-way
--
tempering
your
ideas
--
saying
,
`
Well
now
,
there
's
*NL*
something
in
that
,
'
and
so
on
.
I
agree
with
you
that
this
is
a
*NL*
peculiar
occasion
--
the
country
with
a
will
of
its
own
--
political
*NL*
unions
--
that
sort
of
thing
--
but
we
sometimes
cut
with
rather
too
sharp
*NL*
a
knife
,
Ladislaw
.
These
ten-pound
householders
,
now
:
why
ten
?
Draw
*NL*
the
line
somewhere
--
yes
:
but
why
just
at
ten
?
That
's
a
difficult
*NL*
question
,
now
,
if
you
go
into
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
it
is
,
''
said
Will
,
impatiently
.
``
But
if
you
are
to
wait
*NL*
till
we
get
a
logical
Bill
,
you
must
put
yourself
forward
as
a
*NL*
revolutionist
,
and
then
Middlemarch
would
not
elect
you
,
I
fancy
.
As
*NL*
for
trimming
,
this
is
not
a
time
for
trimming
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Brooke
always
ended
by
agreeing
with
Ladislaw
,
who
still
appeared
*NL*
to
him
a
sort
of
Burke
with
a
leaven
of
Shelley
;
but
after
an
interval
*NL*
the
wisdom
of
his
own
methods
reasserted
itself
,
and
he
was
again
drawn
*NL*
into
using
them
with
much
hopefulness
.
At
this
stage
of
affairs
he
was
*NL*
in
excellent
spirits
,
which
even
supported
him
under
large
advances
of
*NL*
money
;
for
his
powers
of
convincing
and
persuading
had
not
yet
been
*NL*
tested
by
anything
more
difficult
than
a
chairman
's
speech
introducing
*NL*
other
orators
,
or
a
dialogue
with
a
Middlemarch
voter
,
from
which
he
*NL*
came
away
with
a
sense
that
he
was
a
tactician
by
nature
,
and
that
it
*NL*
was
a
pity
he
had
not
gone
earlier
into
this
kind
of
thing
.
He
was
a
*NL*
little
conscious
of
defeat
,
however
,
with
Mr.
Mawmsey
,
a
chief
*NL*
representative
in
Middlemarch
of
that
great
social
power
,
the
retail
*NL*
trader
,
and
naturally
one
of
the
most
doubtful
voters
in
the
*NL*
borough
--
willing
for
his
own
part
to
supply
an
equal
quality
of
teas
*NL*
and
sugars
to
reformer
and
anti-reformer
,
as
well
as
to
agree
*NL*
impartially
with
both
,
and
feeling
like
the
burgesses
of
old
that
this
*NL*
necessity
of
electing
members
was
a
great
burthen
to
a
town
;
for
even
*NL*
if
there
were
no
danger
in
holding
out
hopes
to
all
parties
beforehand
,
*NL*
there
would
be
the
painful
necessity
at
last
of
disappointing
*NL*
respectable
people
whose
names
were
on
his
books
.
He
was
accustomed
to
*NL*
receive
large
orders
from
Mr.
Brooke
of
Tipton
;
but
then
,
there
were
*NL*
many
of
Pinkerton
's
committee
whose
opinions
had
a
great
weight
of
*NL*
grocery
on
their
side
.
Mr.
Mawmsey
thinking
that
Mr.
Brooke
,
as
not
*NL*
too
``
clever
in
his
intellects
,
''
was
the
more
likely
to
forgive
a
grocer
*NL*
who
gave
a
hostile
vote
under
pressure
,
had
become
confidential
in
his
*NL*
back
parlor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
to
Reform
,
sir
,
put
it
in
a
family
light
,
''
he
said
,
rattling
the
*NL*
small
silver
in
his
pocket
,
and
smiling
affably
.
``
Will
it
support
Mrs.
*NL*
Mawmsey
,
and
enable
her
to
bring
up
six
children
when
I
am
no
more
?
I
*NL*
put
the
question
_
fictiously
_
,
knowing
what
must
be
the
answer
.
Very
*NL*
well
,
sir
.
I
ask
you
what
,
as
a
husband
and
a
father
,
I
am
to
do
when
*NL*
gentlemen
come
to
me
and
say

you
like

you

,
I
shall
get
my

elsewhere

when
I

my
liquor

like
to
feel
that
I
am
benefiting
the
country
by
maintaining

tradesmen
of
the
right
color

Those
very
words
have
been
spoken
to
*NL*
me

,
in
the
very
chair
where
you
are
now
sitting

your
honorable
self

complains
to
me

of
your
goods

said
Mr.
Brooke
,
soothingly
,
``

spices

*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
,

am

humble
servant

greatly
obliged

said
Mr.
Mawmsey
,
*NL*
feeling
that
politics
were
clearing
up
a
little
.
``
There
would
be
some
*NL*
pleasure

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

Mr.

it
the

got

no

Mr.
Brooke
*NL*
ended
,
with
a
sense
of
being
a
little
out
at
sea
,
though
finding
it
*NL*
still
enjoyable
.
But
Mr.
Mawmsey
answered
in
a
tone
of
decisive
check
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beg
your
pardon
,
sir
,
but
I
ca
n't
afford
that
.
When
I
give
a
vote
I
*NL*
must
know
what
I
am
doing
;
I
must
look
to
what
will
be
the
effects
on
*NL*
my
till
and
ledger
,
speaking
respectfully
.
Prices
,
I
'll
admit
,
are
*NL*
what
nobody
can
know
the
merits
of
;
and
the
sudden
falls
after
you
've
*NL*
bought
in
currants
,
which
are
a
goods
that
will
not
keep
--
I
've
never
;
*NL*
myself
seen
into
the
ins
and
outs
there
;
which
is
a
rebuke
to
human
*NL*
pride
.
But
as
to
one
family
,
there
's
debtor
and
creditor
,
I
hope
;
*NL*
they
're
not
going
to
reform
that
away
;
else
I
should
vote
for
things

staying
as
they
are

Few
men
have
less
need
to
cry
for
change
than
I

have
,
personally
speaking

that
is
,
for
self

family

I
am
not
one
*NL*
of
those
who
have
nothing
to
lose
:
I
mean
as
to
respectability
both
in
*NL*
parish
and
private
business
,
and
noways
in
respect
of
your
honorable
*NL*
self
and
custom
,
which
you
was
good
enough
to
say
you
would
not
*NL*
withdraw
from
me
,
vote
or
no
vote
,
while
the
article
sent
in
was
*NL*
satisfactory
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
this
conversation
Mr.
Mawmsey
went
up
and
boasted
to
his
wife
*NL*
that
he
had
been
rather
too
many
for
Brooke
of
Tipton
,
and
that
he
*NL*
did
n't
mind
so
much
now
about
going
to
the
poll
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Brooke
on
this
occasion
abstained
from
boasting
of
his
tactics
to
*NL*
Ladislaw
,
who
for
his
part
was
glad
enough
to
persuade
himself
that
he
*NL*
had
no
concern
with
any
canvassing
except
the
purely
argumentative
*NL*
sort
,
and
that
he
worked
no
meaner
engine
than
knowledge
.
Mr.
Brooke
,
*NL*
necessarily
,
had
his
agents
,
who
understood
the
nature
of
the
*NL*
Middlemarch
voter
and
the
means
of
enlisting
his
ignorance
on
the
side
*NL*
of
the
Bill
--
which
were
remarkably
similar
to
the
means
of
enlisting
it
*NL*
on
the
side
against
the
Bill
.
Will
stopped
his
ears
.
Occasionally
*NL*
Parliament
,
like
the
rest
of
our
lives
,
even
to
our
eating
and
apparel
,
*NL*
could
hardly
go
on
if
our
imaginations
were
too
active
about
processes
.
*NL*
There
were
plenty
of
dirty-handed
men
in
the
world
to
do
dirty
*NL*
business
;
and
Will
protested
to
himself
that
his
share
in
bringing
Mr.
*NL*
Brooke
through
would
be
quite
innocent
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
whether
he
should
succeed
in
that
mode
of
contributing
to
the
*NL*
majority
on
the
right
side
was
very
doubtful
to
him
.
He
had
written
*NL*
out
various
speeches
and
memoranda
for
speeches
,
but
he
had
begun
to
*NL*
perceive
that
Mr.
Brooke
's
mind
,
if
it
had
the
burthen
of
remembering
*NL*
any
train
of
thought
,
would
let
it
drop
,
run
away
in
search
of
it
,
and
*NL*
not
easily
come
back
again
.
To
collect
documents
is
one
mode
of
*NL*
serving
your
country
,
and
to
remember
the
contents
of
a
document
is
*NL*
another
.
No
!
the
only
way
in
which
Mr.
Brooke
could
be
coerced
into
*NL*
thinking
of
the
right
arguments
at
the
right
time
was
to
be
well
plied
*NL*
with
them
till
they
took
up
all
the
room
in
his
brain
.
But
here
there
*NL*
was
the
difficulty
of
finding
room
,
so
many
things
having
been
taken
in
*NL*
beforehand
.
Mr.
Brooke
himself
observed
that
his
ideas
stood
rather
in
*NL*
his
way
when
he
was
speaking
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
Ladislaw
's
coaching
was
forthwith
to
be
put
to
the
test
,
for
*NL*
before
the
day
of
nomination
Mr.
Brooke
was
to
explain
himself
to
the
*NL*
worthy
electors
of
Middlemarch
from
the
balcony
of
the
White
Hart
,
*NL*
which
looked
out
advantageously
at
an
angle
of
the
market-place
,
*NL*
commanding
a
large
area
in
front
and
two
converging
streets
.
It
was
a
*NL*
fine
May
morning
,
and
everything
seemed
hopeful
:
there
was
some
*NL*
prospect
of
an
understanding
between
Bagster
's
committee
and
Brooke
's
,
*NL*
to
which
Mr.
Bulstrode
,
Mr.
Standish
as
a
Liberal
lawyer
,
and
such
*NL*
manufacturers
as
Mr.
Plymdale
and
Mr.
Vincy
,
gave
a
solidity
which
*NL*
almost
counterbalanced
Mr.
Hawley
and
his
associates
who
sat
for
*NL*
Pinkerton
at
the
Green
Dragon
.
Mr.
Brooke
,
conscious
of
having
*NL*
weakened
the
blasts
of
the
``
Trumpet
''
against
him
,
by
his
reforms
as
a
*NL*
landlord
in
the
last
half
year
,
and
hearing
himself
cheered
a
little
as
*NL*
he
drove
into
the
town
,
felt
his
heart
tolerably
light
under
his
*NL*
buff-colored
waistcoat
.
But
with
regard
to
critical
occasions
,
it
*NL*
often
happens
that
all
moments
seem
comfortably
remote
until
the
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
looks
well
,
eh
?
''
said
Mr.
Brooke
as
the
crowd
gathered
.
``
I
shall
*NL*
have
a
good
audience
,
at
any
rate
.
I
like
this
,
now
--
this
kind
of
*NL*
public
made
up
of
one
's
own
neighbors
,
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
weavers
and
tanners
of
Middlemarch
,
unlike
Mr.
Mawmsey
,
had
never
*NL*
thought
of
Mr.
Brooke
as
a
neighbor
,
and
were
not
more
attached
to
him
*NL*
than
if
he
had
been
sent
in
a
box
from
London
.
But
they
listened
*NL*
without
much
disturbance
to
the
speakers
who
introduced
the
candidate
,
*NL*
one
of
them
--
a
political
personage
from
Brassing
,
who
came
to
tell
*NL*
Middlemarch
its
duty
--
spoke
so
fully
,
that
it
was
alarming
to
think
*NL*
what
the
candidate
could
find
to
say
after
him
.
Meanwhile
the
crowd
*NL*
became
denser
,
and
as
the
political
personage
neared
the
end
of
his
*NL*
speech
,
Mr.
Brooke
felt
a
remarkable
change
in
his
sensations
while
he
*NL*
still
handled
his
eye-glass
,
trifled
with
documents
before
him
,
and
*NL*
exchanged
remarks
with
his
committee
,
as
a
man
to
whom
the
moment
of
*NL*
summons
was
indifferent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
take
another
glass
of
sherry
,
Ladislaw
,
''
he
said
,
with
an
easy
*NL*
air
,
to
Will
,
who
was
close
behind
him
,
and
presently
handed
him
the
*NL*
supposed
fortifier
.
It
was
ill-chosen
;
for
Mr.
Brooke
was
an
*NL*
abstemious
man
,
and
to
drink
a
second
glass
of
sherry
quickly
at
no
*NL*
great
interval
from
the
first
was
a
surprise
to
his
system
which
tended
*NL*
to
scatter
his
energies
instead
of
collecting
them
.
Pray
pity
him
:
so
*NL*
many
English
gentlemen
make
themselves
miserable
by
speechifying
on
*NL*
entirely
private
grounds
!
whereas
Mr.
Brooke
wished
to
serve
his
*NL*
country
by
standing
for
Parliament
--
which
,
indeed
,
may
also
be
done
on
*NL*
private
grounds
,
but
being
once
undertaken
does
absolutely
demand
some
*NL*
speechifying
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
about
the
beginning
of
his
speech
that
Mr.
Brooke
was
at
all
*NL*
anxious
;
this
,
he
felt
sure
,
would
be
all
right
;
he
should
have
it
*NL*
quite
pat
,
cut
out
as
neatly
as
a
set
of
couplets
from
Pope
.
Embarking
*NL*
would
be
easy
,
but
the
vision
of
open
sea
that
might
come
after
was
*NL*
alarming
.
``
And
questions
,
now
,
''
hinted
the
demon
just
waking
up
in
his
*NL*
stomach
,
``
somebody
may
put
questions
about
the
schedules
.
--
Ladislaw
,
''
*NL*
he
continued
,
aloud
,
``
just
hand
me
the
memorandum
of
the
schedules
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
Mr.
Brooke
presented
himself
on
the
balcony
,
the
cheers
were
quite
*NL*
loud
enough
to
counterbalance
the
yells
,
groans
,
brayings
,
and
other
*NL*
expressions
of
adverse
theory
,
which
were
so
moderate
that
Mr.
Standish
*NL*
-LRB-
decidedly
an
old
bird
-RRB-
observed
in
the
ear
next
to
him
,
``
This
looks
*NL*
dangerous
,
by
God
!
Hawley
has
got
some
deeper
plan
than
this
.
''
Still
,
*NL*
the
cheers
were
exhilarating
,
and
no
candidate
could
look
more
amiable
*NL*
than
Mr.
Brooke
,
with
the
memorandum
in
his
breast-pocket
,
his
left
*NL*
hand
on
the
rail
of
the
balcony
,
and
his
right
trifling
with
his
*NL*
eye-glass
.
The
striking
points
in
his
appearance
were
his
buff
*NL*
waistcoat
,
short-clipped
blond
hair
,
and
neutral
physiognomy
.
He
began
*NL*
with
some
confidence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gentlemen
--
Electors
of
Middlemarch
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
so
much
the
right
thing
that
a
little
pause
after
it
seemed
*NL*
natural
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
uncommonly
glad
to
be
here
--
I
was
never
so
proud
and
happy
in
my
*NL*
life
--
never
so
happy
,
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
a
bold
figure
of
speech
,
but
not
exactly
the
right
thing
;
for
,
*NL*
unhappily
,
the
pat
opening
had
slipped
away
--
even
couplets
from
Pope
*NL*
may
be
but
``
fallings
from
us
,
vanishings
,
''
when
fear
clutches
us
,
and
a
*NL*
glass
of
sherry
is
hurrying
like
smoke
among
our
ideas
.
Ladislaw
,
who
*NL*
stood
at
the
window
behind
the
speaker
,
thought
,
``
it
's
all
up
now
.
The
*NL*
only
chance
is
that
,
since
the
best
thing
wo
n't
always
do
,
floundering
*NL*
may
answer
for
once
.
''
Mr.
Brooke
,
meanwhile
,
having
lost
other
clews
,
*NL*
fell
back
on
himself
and
his
qualifications
--
always
an
appropriate
*NL*
graceful
subject
for
a
candidate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
a
close
neighbor
of
yours
,
my
good
friends
--
you
've
known
me
on
*NL*
the
bench
a
good
while
--
I
've
always
gone
a
good
deal
into
public
*NL*
questions
--
machinery
,
now
,
and
machine-breaking
--
you
're
many
of
you
*NL*
concerned
with
machinery
,
and
I
've
been
going
into
that
lately
.
It
*NL*
wo
n't
do
,
you
know
,
breaking
machines
:
everything
must
go
on
--
trade
,
*NL*
manufactures
,
commerce
,
interchange
of
staples
--
that
kind
of
*NL*
thing
--
since
Adam
Smith
,
that
must
go
on
.
We
must
look
all
over
the
*NL*
globe
:
--
`
Observation
with
extensive
view
,
'
must
look
everywhere
,
`
from
*NL*
China
to
Peru
,
'
as
somebody
says
--
Johnson
,
I
think
,
`
The
Rambler
,
'
you
*NL*
know
.
That
is
what
I
have
done
up
to
a
certain
point
--
not
as
far
as
*NL*
Peru
;
but
I
've
not
always
stayed
at
home
--
I
saw
it
would
n't
do
.
I
've
*NL*
been
in
the
Levant
,
where
some
of
your
Middlemarch
goods
go
--
and
then
,
*NL*
again
,
in
the
Baltic
.
The
Baltic
,
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Plying
among
his
recollections
in
this
way
,
Mr.
Brooke
might
have
got
*NL*
along
,
easily
to
himself
,
and
would
have
come
back
from
the
remotest
*NL*
seas
without
trouble
;
but
a
diabolical
procedure
had
been
set
up
by
the
*NL*
enemy
.
At
one
and
the
same
moment
there
had
risen
above
the
shoulders
*NL*
of
the
crowd
,
nearly
opposite
Mr.
Brooke
,
and
within
ten
yards
of
him
,
*NL*
the
effigy
of
himself
:
buff-colored
waistcoat
,
eye-glass
,
and
neutral
*NL*
physiognomy
,
painted
on
rag
;
and
there
had
arisen
,
apparently
in
the
*NL*
air
,
like
the
note
of
the
cuckoo
,
a
parrot-like
,
Punch-voiced
echo
of
*NL*
his
words
.
Everybody
looked
up
at
the
open
windows
in
the
houses
at
*NL*
the
opposite
angles
of
the
converging
streets
;
but
they
were
either
*NL*
blank
,
or
filled
by
laughing
listeners
.
The
most
innocent
echo
has
an
*NL*
impish
mockery
in
it
when
it
follows
a
gravely
persistent
speaker
,
and
*NL*
this
echo
was
not
at
all
innocent
;
if
it
did
not
follow
with
the
*NL*
precision
of
a
natural
echo
,
it
had
a
wicked
choice
of
the
words
it
*NL*
overtook
.
By
the
time
it
said
,
``
The
Baltic
,
now
,
''
the
laugh
which
had
*NL*
been
running
through
the
audience
became
a
general
shout
,
and
but
for
*NL*
the
sobering
effects
of
party
and
that
great
public
cause
which
the
*NL*
entanglement
of
things
had
identified
with
``
Brooke
of
Tipton
,
''
the
*NL*
laugh
might
have
caught
his
committee
.
Mr.
Bulstrode
asked
,
*NL*
reprehensively
,
what
the
new
police
was
doing
;
but
a
voice
could
not
*NL*
well
be
collared
,
and
an
attack
on
the
effigy
of
the
candidate
would
*NL*
have
been
too
equivocal
,
since
Hawley
probably
meant
it
to
be
pelted
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Brooke
himself
was
not
in
a
position
to
be
quickly
conscious
of
*NL*
anything
except
a
general
slipping
away
of
ideas
within
himself
:
he
had
*NL*
even
a
little
singing
in
the
ears
,
and
he
was
the
only
person
who
had
*NL*
not
yet
taken
distinct
account
of
the
echo
or
discerned
the
image
of
*NL*
himself
.
Few
things
hold
the
perceptions
more
thoroughly
captive
than
*NL*
anxiety
about
what
we
have
got
to
say
.
Mr.
Brooke
heard
the
laughter
;
*NL*
but
he
had
expected
some
Tory
efforts
at
disturbance
,
and
he
was
at
*NL*
this
moment
additionally
excited
by
the
tickling
,
stinging
sense
that
*NL*
his
lost
exordium
was
coming
back
to
fetch
him
from
the
Baltic
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
reminds
me
,
''
he
went
on
,
thrusting
a
hand
into
his
side-pocket
,
*NL*
with
an
easy
air
,
``
if
I
wanted
a
precedent
,
you
know
--
but
we
never
want
*NL*
a
precedent
for
the
right
thing
--
but
there
is
Chatham
,
now
;
I
ca
n't
say
*NL*
I
should
have
supported
Chatham
,
or
Pitt
,
the
younger
Pitt
--
he
was
not
*NL*
a
man
of
ideas
,
and
we
want
ideas
,
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Blast
your
ideas
!
we
want
the
Bill
,
''
said
a
loud
rough
voice
from
the
*NL*
crowd
below
.
*NL*
*NL*
Immediately
the
invisible
Punch
,
who
had
hitherto
followed
Mr.
Brooke
,
*NL*
repeated
,
``
Blast
your
ideas
!
we
want
the
Bill
.
''
The
laugh
was
louder
*NL*
than
ever
,
and
for
the
first
time
Mr.
Brooke
being
himself
silent
,
*NL*
heard
distinctly
the
mocking
echo
.
But
it
seemed
to
ridicule
his
*NL*
interrupter
,
and
in
that
light
was
encouraging
;
so
he
replied
with
*NL*
amenity
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
something
in
what
you
say
,
my
good
friend
,
and
what
do
we
*NL*
meet
for
but
to
speak
our
minds
--
freedom
of
opinion
,
freedom
of
the
*NL*
press
,
liberty
--
that
kind
of
thing
?
The
Bill
,
now
--
you
shall
have
the
*NL*
Bill
''
--
here
Mr.
Brooke
paused
a
moment
to
fix
on
his
eye-glass
and
take
*NL*
the
paper
from
his
breast-pocket
,
with
a
sense
of
being
practical
and
*NL*
coming
to
particulars
.
The
invisible
Punch
followed
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
shall
have
the
Bill
,
Mr.
Brooke
,
per
electioneering
contest
,
and
a
*NL*
seat
outside
Parliament
as
delivered
,
five
thousand
pounds
,
seven
*NL*
shillings
,
and
fourpence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Brooke
,
amid
the
roars
of
laughter
,
turned
red
,
let
his
eye-glass
*NL*
fall
,
and
looking
about
him
confusedly
,
saw
the
image
of
himself
,
which
*NL*
had
come
nearer
.
The
next
moment
he
saw
it
dolorously
bespattered
with
*NL*
eggs
.
His
spirit
rose
a
little
,
and
his
voice
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Buffoonery
,
tricks
,
ridicule
the
test
of
truth
--
all
that
is
very
*NL*
well
''
--
here
an
unpleasant
egg
broke
on
Mr.
Brooke
's
shoulder
,
as
the
*NL*
echo
said
,
``
All
that
is
very
well
;
''
then
came
a
hail
of
eggs
,
chiefly
*NL*
aimed
at
the
image
,
but
occasionally
hitting
the
original
,
as
if
by
*NL*
chance
.
There
was
a
stream
of
new
men
pushing
among
the
crowd
;
*NL*
whistles
,
yells
,
bellowings
,
and
fifes
made
all
the
greater
hubbub
*NL*
because
there
was
shouting
and
struggling
to
put
them
down
.
No
voice
*NL*
would
have
had
wing
enough
to
rise
above
the
uproar
,
and
Mr.
Brooke
,
*NL*
disagreeably
anointed
,
stood
his
ground
no
longer
.
The
frustration
*NL*
would
have
been
less
exasperating
if
it
had
been
less
gamesome
and
*NL*
boyish
:
a
serious
assault
of
which
the
newspaper
reporter
``
can
aver
*NL*
that
it
endangered
the
learned
gentleman
's
ribs
,
''
or
can
respectfully
*NL*
bear
witness
to
``
the
soles
of
that
gentleman
's
boots
having
been
*NL*
visible
above
the
railing
,
''
has
perhaps
more
consolations
attached
to
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Brooke
re-entered
the
committee-room
,
saying
,
as
carelessly
as
he
*NL*
could
,
``
This
is
a
little
too
bad
,
you
know
.
I
should
have
got
the
ear
*NL*
of
the
people
by-and-by
--
but
they
did
n't
give
me
time
.
I
should
have
*NL*
gone
into
the
Bill
by-and-by
,
you
know
,
''
he
added
,
glancing
at
*NL*
Ladislaw
.
``
However
,
things
will
come
all
right
at
the
nomination
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
was
not
resolved
unanimously
that
things
would
come
right
;
on
*NL*
the
contrary
,
the
committee
looked
rather
grim
,
and
the
political
*NL*
personage
from
Brassing
was
writing
busily
,
as
if
he
were
brewing
new
*NL*
devices
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
Bowyer
who
did
it
,
''
said
Mr.
Standish
,
evasively
.
``
I
know
it
*NL*
as
well
as
if
he
had
been
advertised
.
He
's
uncommonly
good
at
*NL*
ventriloquism
,
and
he
did
it
uncommonly
well
,
by
God
!
Hawley
has
been
*NL*
having
him
to
dinner
lately
:
there
's
a
fund
of
talent
in
Bowyer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
know
,
you
never
mentioned
him
to
me
,
Standish
,
else
I
would
*NL*
have
invited
him
to
dine
,
''
said
poor
Mr.
Brooke
,
who
had
gone
through
a
*NL*
great
deal
of
inviting
for
the
good
of
his
country
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
not
a
more
paltry
fellow
in
Middlemarch
than
Bowyer
,
''
said
*NL*
Ladislaw
,
indignantly
,
``
but
it
seems
as
if
the
paltry
fellows
were
*NL*
always
to
turn
the
scale
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Will
was
thoroughly
out
of
temper
with
himself
as
well
as
with
his
*NL*
``
principal
,
''
and
he
went
to
shut
himself
in
his
rooms
with
a
*NL*
half-formed
resolve
to
throw
up
the
``
Pioneer
''
and
Mr.
Brooke
together
.
*NL*
Why
should
he
stay
?
If
the
impassable
gulf
between
himself
and
*NL*
Dorothea
were
ever
to
be
filled
up
,
it
must
rather
be
by
his
going
away
*NL*
and
getting
into
a
thoroughly
different
position
than
by
staying
here
*NL*
and
slipping
into
deserved
contempt
as
an
understrapper
of
Brooke
's
.
*NL*
Then
came
the
young
dream
of
wonders
that
he
might
do
--
in
five
years
,
*NL*
for
example
:
political
writing
,
political
speaking
,
would
get
a
higher
*NL*
value
now
public
life
was
going
to
be
wider
and
more
national
,
and
they
*NL*
might
give
him
such
distinction
that
he
would
not
seem
to
be
asking
*NL*
Dorothea
to
step
down
to
him
.
Five
years
:
--
if
he
could
only
be
sure
*NL*
that
she
cared
for
him
more
than
for
others
;
if
he
could
only
make
her
*NL*
aware
that
he
stood
aloof
until
he
could
tell
his
love
without
lowering
*NL*
himself
--
then
he
could
go
away
easily
,
and
begin
a
career
which
at
*NL*
five-and-twenty
seemed
probable
enough
in
the
inward
order
of
things
,
*NL*
where
talent
brings
fame
,
and
fame
everything
else
which
is
delightful
.
*NL*
He
could
speak
and
he
could
write
;
he
could
master
any
subject
if
he
*NL*
chose
,
and
he
meant
always
to
take
the
side
of
reason
and
justice
,
on
*NL*
which
he
would
carry
all
his
ardor
.
Why
should
he
not
one
day
be
*NL*
lifted
above
the
shoulders
of
the
crowd
,
and
feel
that
he
had
won
that
*NL*
eminence
well
?
Without
doubt
he
would
leave
Middlemarch
,
go
to
town
,
*NL*
and
make
himself
fit
for
celebrity
by
``
eating
his
dinners
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
not
immediately
:
not
until
some
kind
of
sign
had
passed
between
him
*NL*
and
Dorothea
.
He
could
not
be
satisfied
until
she
knew
why
,
even
if
he
*NL*
were
the
man
she
would
choose
to
marry
,
he
would
not
marry
her
.
Hence
*NL*
he
must
keep
his
post
and
bear
with
Mr.
Brooke
a
little
longer
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
soon
had
reason
to
suspect
that
Mr.
Brooke
had
anticipated
him
*NL*
in
the
wish
to
break
up
their
connection
.
Deputations
without
and
*NL*
voices
within
had
concurred
in
inducing
that
philanthropist
to
take
a
*NL*
stronger
measure
than
usual
for
the
good
of
mankind
;
namely
,
to
*NL*
withdraw
in
favor
of
another
candidate
,
to
whom
he
left
the
advantages
*NL*
of
his
canvassing
machinery
.
He
himself
called
this
a
strong
measure
,
*NL*
but
observed
that
his
health
was
less
capable
of
sustaining
excitement
*NL*
than
he
had
imagined
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
felt
uneasy
about
the
chest
--
it
wo
n't
do
to
carry
that
too
*NL*
far
,
''
he
said
to
Ladislaw
in
explaining
the
affair
.
``
I
must
pull
up
.
*NL*
Poor
Casaubon
was
a
warning
,
you
know
.
I
've
made
some
heavy
advances
,
*NL*
but
I
've
dug
a
channel
.
It
's
rather
coarse
work
--
this
electioneering
,
*NL*
eh
,
Ladislaw
?
dare
say
you
are
tired
of
it
.
However
,
we
have
dug
a
*NL*
channel
with
the
`
Pioneer
'
--
put
things
in
a
track
,
and
so
on
.
A
more
*NL*
ordinary
man
than
you
might
carry
it
on
now
--
more
ordinary
,
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
wish
me
to
give
it
up
?
''
said
Will
,
the
quick
color
coming
in
*NL*
his
face
,
as
he
rose
from
the
writing-table
,
and
took
a
turn
of
three
*NL*
steps
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
.
``
I
am
ready
to
do
so
whenever
you
*NL*
wish
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
to
wishing
,
my
dear
Ladislaw

I
have
the
highest
opinion

your

powers

But
about
the
`
Pioneer

I
have
been
consulting
a
*NL*
little
with
some
of
the
men
on
our
side

and
they
are
inclined
to
take
*NL*
it
into
their
hands
--
indemnify
me
to
a
certain
extent

carry
it
on

in

fact

And
under
the
circumstances
,
you
might
like
to
give
up
--
might
*NL*
find
a
better
field

These
people
might
not
take

high
view

you

which
I
have
always
taken

as
an
alter
ego

a

I
*NL*
always
looked
forward

doing

a

But
I
'll
write
you
any
letters

Althorpe

people
of
that
kind

I
've
met
Althorpe

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
exceedingly
obliged
to
you
,
''
said
Ladislaw
,
proudly
.
``
Since
you
*NL*
are
going
to
part
with
the

'
I
need
not
trouble
you
about
the

steps
I
shall
take
.
I
may
choose
to
continue
here
for
the
present
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
Mr.
Brooke
had
left
him
Will
said
to
himself
,
``
The
rest
of
the
*NL*
family
have
been
urging
him

I

WORDSWORTH

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
On
that
June
evening
when
Mr.
Farebrother
knew
that
he
was
to
have
the
*NL*
Lowick
living
,
there
was
joy
in
the
old
fashioned
parlor
,
and
even
the
*NL*
portraits
of
the
great
lawyers
seemed
to
look
on
with
satisfaction
.
*NL*
His
mother
left
her
tea
and
toast
untouched
,
but
sat
with
her
usual
*NL*
pretty
primness
,
only
showing
her
emotion
by
that
flush
in
the
cheeks
*NL*
and
brightness
in
the
eyes
which
give
an
old
woman
a
touching
momentary
*NL*
identity
with
her
far-off
youthful
self
,
and
saying
decisively
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
greatest
comfort
,
Camden
,
is
that
you
have
deserved
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
a
man
gets
a
good
berth

mother

half
the
deserving
must
come
*NL*
after

''
said
the
son
,
brimful
of
pleasure
,
and
not
trying
to
conceal
*NL*
it
.
The
gladness
in
his
face
was
of
that
active
kind
which
seems
to
*NL*
have
energy
enough
not
only
to
flash
outwardly
,
but
to
light
up
busy
*NL*
vision
within
:
one
seemed
to
see
thoughts
,
as
well
as
delight
,
in
his
*NL*
glances
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
aunt
,
''
he
went
on
,
rubbing
his
hands
and
looking
at
Miss
Noble
,
*NL*
who
was
making
tender
little
beaver-like
noises
,
``
There
shall
be
*NL*
sugar-candy
always
on
the
table

you
to
steal

a

many

*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Noble
nodded
at
her
nephew
with
a
subdued
half-frightened
laugh
,
*NL*
conscious
of
having
already
dropped
an
additional
lump
of
sugar
into
*NL*
her
basket
on
the
strength
of
the
new
preferment

*NL*
*NL*
``

the
Vicar

on

Miss

*NL*
crying
heartily

was
her
way

smiled
through

said

``

the
Vicar

rising

pushing
his

away

looking

down
at
himself

the

not

with
majestic

discretion

In

said
Mrs.
Farebrother
,
innocent
of
the
meaning
*NL*
that
whist
had
for
her
son
,
and
speaking
rather
sharply
,
as
at
some
*NL*
dangerous
countenancing
of
new
doctrine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
be
too
busy
for
whist

I
shall
have
two
parishes

''
said
the
*NL*
Vicar
,
preferring
not
to
discuss
the
virtues
of
that
game
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
already
said
to
Dorothea
,
``
I
do
n't
feel
bound
to
give
up
St.
*NL*
Botolph
's
.
It
is
protest
enough
against
the
pluralism
they
want
to
*NL*
reform
if
I
give
somebody
else
most
of
the
money
.
The
stronger
thing
*NL*
is
not
to
give
up
power
,
but
to
use
it
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
thought
of
that
,
''
said
Dorothea
.
``
So
far
as
self
is
concerned
,
*NL*
I
think
it
would
be
easier
to
give
up
power
and
money
than
to
keep
*NL*
them
.
It
seems
very
unfitting
that
I
should
have
this
patronage
,
yet
I
*NL*
felt
that
I
ought
not
to
let
it
be
used
by
some
one
else
instead
of
me
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
I
who
am
bound
to
act
so
that
you
will
not
regret
your
power

*NL*
said
Mr.
Farebrother
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
was
one
of
the
natures
in
which
conscience
gets
the
more
active
*NL*
when
the
yoke
of
life
ceases
to
gall
them
.
He
made
no
display
of
*NL*
humility
on
the
subject
,
but
in
his
heart
he
felt
rather
ashamed
that
*NL*
his
conduct
had
shown
laches
which
others
who
did
not
get
benefices
*NL*
were
free
from
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
used
often
to
wish
I
had
been
something
else
than
a
clergyman
,
''
he
*NL*
said
to
Lydgate
,
``
but
perhaps
it
will
be
better
to
try
and
make
as
good
*NL*
a
clergyman
out
of
myself
as
I
can
.
That
is
the
well-beneficed
point
*NL*
of
view
,
you
perceive
,
from
which
difficulties
are
much
simplified

he
*NL*
ended
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Vicar
did
feel
then
as
if
his
share
of
duties
would
be
easy
.
But
*NL*
Duty
has
a
trick
of
behaving
unexpectedly
--
something
like
a
heavy
*NL*
friend
whom
we
have
amiably
asked
to
visit
us
,
and
who
breaks
his
leg
*NL*
within
our
gates

*NL*
*NL*
Hardly
a
week
later
,
Duty
presented
itself
in
his
study
under
the
*NL*
disguise
of
Fred
Vincy
,
now
returned
from
Omnibus
College
with
his
*NL*
bachelor
's
degree
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
ashamed
to
trouble
you
,
Mr.
Farebrother
,
''
said
Fred
,
whose
fair
*NL*
open
face
was
propitiating
,
``
but
you
are
the
only
friend
I
can
consult
.
*NL*
I
told
you
everything
once
before
,
and
you
were
so
good
that
I
ca
n't
*NL*
help
coming
to
you
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sit
down
,
Fred
,
I
'm
ready
to
hear
and
do
anything
I
can
,
''
said
the
*NL*
Vicar
,
who
was
busy
packing
some
small
objects
for
removal
,
and
went
on
*NL*
with
his
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wanted
to
tell
you
--
''
Fred
hesitated
an
instant
and
then
went
on
*NL*
plungingly
,
``
I
might
go
into
the
Church
now
;
and
really
,
look
where
I
*NL*
may
,
I
ca
n't
see
anything
else
to
do
.
I
do
n't
like
it
,
but
I
know
it
's
*NL*
uncommonly
hard
on
my
father
to
say
so
,
after
he
has
spent
a
good
deal
*NL*
of
money
in
educating
me
for
it
.
''
Fred
paused
again
an
instant
,
and
*NL*
then
repeated
,
``
and
I
ca
n't
see
anything
else
to
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
talk
to
your
father
about
it
,
Fred
,
but
I
made
little
way
with
*NL*
him
.
He
said
it
was
too
late
.
But
you
have
got
over
one
bridge
now
:
*NL*
what
are
your
other
difficulties
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Merely
that
I
do
n't
like
it
.
I
do
n't
like
divinity
,
and
preaching
,
*NL*
and
feeling
obliged
to
look
serious
.
I
like
riding
across
country
,
and
*NL*
doing
as
other
men
do
.
I
do
n't
mean
that
I
want
to
be
a
bad
fellow
in
*NL*
any
way
;
but
I
've
no
taste
for
the
sort
of
thing
people
expect
of
a
*NL*
clergyman
.
And
yet
what
else
am
I
to
do
?
My
father
ca
n't
spare
me
any
*NL*
capital
,
else
I
might
go
into
farming
.
And
he
has
no
room
for
me
in
*NL*
his
trade
.
And
of
course
I
ca
n't
begin
to
study
for
law
or
physic
now
,
*NL*
when
my
father
wants
me
to
earn
something
.
It
's
all
very
well
to
say
*NL*
I
'm
wrong
to
go
into
the
Church
;
but
those
who
say
so
might
as
well
*NL*
tell
me
to
go
into
the
backwoods
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fred
's
voice
had
taken
a
tone
of
grumbling
remonstrance
,
and
Mr.
*NL*
Farebrother
might
have
been
inclined
to
smile
if
his
mind
had
not
been
*NL*
too
busy
in
imagining
more
than
Fred
told
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
any
difficulties
about
doctrines
--
about
the
Articles
?
''
he
*NL*
said
,
trying
hard
to
think
of
the
question
simply
for
Fred
's
sake
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
I
suppose
the
Articles
are
right
.
I
am
not
prepared
with
any
*NL*
arguments
to
disprove
them
,
and
much
better
,
cleverer
fellows
than
I
am
*NL*
go
in
for
them
entirely
.
I
think
it
would
be
rather
ridiculous
in
me
*NL*
to
urge
scruples
of
that
sort
,
as
if
I
were
a
judge
,
''
said
Fred
,
quite
*NL*
simply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
,
then
,
it
has
occurred
to
you
that
you
might
be
a
fair
*NL*
parish
priest
without
being
much
of
a
divine
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
,
if
I
am
obliged
to
be
a
clergyman
,
I
shall
try
and
do
my
*NL*
duty
,
though
I
may
n't
like
it
.
Do
you
think
any
body
ought
to
blame
*NL*
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
going
into
the
Church
under
the
circumstances
?
That
depends
on
*NL*
your
conscience
,
Fred
--
how
far
you
have
counted
the
cost
,
and
seen
what
*NL*
your
position
will
require
of
you
.
I
can
only
tell
you
about
myself
,
*NL*
that
I
have
always
been
too
lax
,
and
have
been
uneasy
in
consequence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
there
is
another
hindrance
,
''
said
Fred
,
coloring
.
``
I
did
not
tell
*NL*
you
before
,
though
perhaps
I
may
have
said
things
that
made
you
guess
*NL*
it
.
There
is
somebody
I
am
very
fond
of
:
I
have
loved
her
ever
since
*NL*
we
were
children
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Garth
,
I
suppose
?
''
said
the
Vicar
,
examining
some
labels
very
*NL*
closely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
I
should
n't
mind
anything
if
she
would
have
me
.
And
I
know
I
*NL*
could
be
a
good
fellow
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
think
she
returns
the
feeling
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
never
will
say
so
;
and
a
good
while
ago
she
made
me
promise
not
to
*NL*
speak
to
her
about
it
again
.
And
she
has
set
her
mind
especially
*NL*
against
my
being
a
clergyman
;
I
know
that
.
But
I
ca
n't
give
her
up
.
I
*NL*
do
think
she
cares
about
me
.
I
saw
Mrs.
Garth
last
night
,
and
she
said
*NL*
that
Mary
was
staying
at
Lowick
Rectory
with
Miss
Farebrother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
she
is
very
kindly
helping
my
sister

Do
you
wish
to
go
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
want
to
ask
a
great
favor
of
you
.
I
am
ashamed
to
bother
you
in
*NL*
this
way
;
but
Mary
might
listen
to
what
you
said
,
if
you
mentioned
the
*NL*
subject
to
her
--
I
mean
about
my
going
into
the
Church
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
rather
a
delicate
task
,
my
dear
Fred
.
I
shall
have
to
*NL*
presuppose
your
attachment
to
her
;
and
to
enter
on
the
subject
as
you
*NL*
wish
me
to
do
,
will
be
asking
her
to
tell
me
whether
she
returns
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
what
I
want
her
to
tell
you
,

said
Fred
,
bluntly
.
``
I
do
n't
*NL*
know
what
to
do
,
unless
I
can
get
at
her
feeling

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
mean
that
you
would
be
guided
by
that
as
to
your
going
into
the
*NL*
Church

*NL*
*NL*
``
If
Mary
said
she

never
have
me

well
go
wrong
in
one
*NL*
way

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
nonsense
,
Fred
.
Men
outlive
their
love

but
they
do
n't
*NL*
outlive
the
consequences
of
their
recklessness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
my
sort
of
love
:
I
have
never
been
without
loving
Mary

If
I
had
*NL*
to
give
her
up
,
it
would
be
like
beginning
to
live
on
wooden
legs

*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
she
not
be
hurt
at
my
intrusion

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

I
feel
sure

you
more

she

not
put
you
off
with
fun
as
she
does
me

Of
course
I
could
*NL*
not
have
told
any
one
else

or
asked
any
one
else
to
speak
to
her
,

*NL*
you

There
is
no
one
else
who
could
be
such
a
friend
to
both
of
us
.
''
*NL*
Fred
paused
a
moment
,
and
then
said
,
rather
complainingly
,
``
And
she
*NL*
ought
to
acknowledge
that
I
have
worked
in
order
to
pass

She
ought
to
*NL*
believe
that
I
would
exert
myself
for
her
sake
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
moment
's
silence
before
Mr.
Farebrother
laid
down
his
work
,
*NL*
and
putting
out
his
hand
to
Fred
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
my
boy
.
I
will
do
what
you
wish
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
very
day
Mr.
Farebrother
went
to
Lowick
parsonage
on
the
nag
which
*NL*
he
had
just
set
up
.
``
Decidedly
I
am
an
old
stalk
,
''
he
thought
,
``
the
*NL*
young
growths
are
pushing
me
aside
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
found
Mary
in
the
garden
gathering
roses
and
sprinkling
the
petals
*NL*
on
a
sheet
.
The
sun
was
low
,
and
tall
trees
sent
their
shadows
across
*NL*
the
grassy
walks
where
Mary
was
moving
without
bonnet
or
parasol
.
She
*NL*
did
not
observe
Mr.
Farebrother
's
approach
along
the
grass
,
and
had
*NL*
just
stooped
down
to
lecture
a
small
black-and-tan
terrier
,
which
would
*NL*
persist
in
walking
on
the
sheet
and
smelling
at
the
rose-leaves
as
Mary
*NL*
sprinkled
them
.
She
took
his
fore-paws
in
one
hand
,
and
lifted
up
the
*NL*
forefinger
of
the
other
,
while
the
dog
wrinkled
his
brows
and
looked
*NL*
embarrassed
.
``
Fly
,
Fly
,
I
am
ashamed
of
you
,
''
Mary
was
saying
in
a
*NL*
grave
contralto
.
``
This
is
not
becoming
in
a
sensible
dog
;
anybody
*NL*
would
think
you
were
a
silly
young
gentleman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
unmerciful
to
young
gentlemen
,
Miss
Garth
,
''
said
the
Vicar
,
*NL*
within
two
yards
of
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
started
up
and
blushed
.
``
It
always
answers
to
reason
with
Fly
,
''
*NL*
she
said
,
laughingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
not
with
young
gentlemen
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
with
some
,
I
suppose
;
since
some
of
them
turn
into
excellent
men
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
glad
of
that
admission
,
because
I
want
at
this
very
moment
to
*NL*
interest
you
in
a
young
gentleman
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
a
silly
one
,
I
hope

said
Mary
,
beginning
to
pluck
the
roses
*NL*
again
,
and
feeling
her
heart
beat
uncomfortably
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
though
perhaps
wisdom
is
not
his
strong
point
,
but
rather
*NL*
affection
and
sincerity
.
However
,
wisdom
lies
more
in
those
two
*NL*
qualities
than
people
are
apt
to
imagine
.
I
hope
you
know
by
those
*NL*
marks
what
young
gentleman
I
mean

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
think
I
do
,
''
said
Mary
,
bravely
,
her
face
getting
more
serious
,
*NL*
and
her
hands
cold
;
``
it
must
be
Fred
Vincy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
asked
me
to
consult
you
about
his
going
into
the
Church
.
I
*NL*
hope
you
will
not
think
that
I
consented
to
take
a
liberty
in
promising
*NL*
to
do
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
contrary
,
Mr.
Farebrother
,
''
said
Mary
,
giving
up
the
roses
,
and
*NL*
folding
her
arms
,
but
unable
to
look
up
,
``
whenever
you
have
anything
to
*NL*
say
to
me
I
feel
honored
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
before
I
enter
on
that
question
,
let
me
just
touch
a
point
on
*NL*
which
your
father
took
me
into
confidence
;
by
the
way
,
it
was
that
very
*NL*
evening
on
which
I
once
before
fulfilled
a
mission
from
Fred
,
just
*NL*
after
he
had
gone
to
college
.
Mr.
Garth
told
me
what
happened
on
the
*NL*
night
of
Featherstone
's
death
--
how
you
refused
to
burn
the
will
;
and
he
*NL*
said
that
you
had
some
heart-prickings
on
that
subject
,
because
you
had
*NL*
been
the
innocent
means
of
hindering
Fred
from
getting
his
ten
thousand
*NL*
pounds
.
I
have
kept
that
in
mind
,
and
I
have
heard
something
that
may
*NL*
relieve
you
on
that
score
--
may
show
you
that
no
sin-offering
is
*NL*
demanded
from
you
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Farebrother
paused
a
moment
and
looked
at
Mary
.
He
meant
to
give
*NL*
Fred
his
full
advantage
,
but
it
would
be
well
,
he
thought
,
to
clear
her
*NL*
mind
of
any
superstitions
,
such
as
women
sometimes
follow
when
they
do
*NL*
a
man
the
wrong
of
marrying
him
as
an
act
of
atonement
.
Mary
's
cheeks
*NL*
had
begun
to
burn
a
little
,
and
she
was
mute
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
mean
,
that
your
action
made
no
real
difference
to
Fred
's
lot
.
I
*NL*
find
that
the
first
will
would
not
have
been
legally
good
after
the
*NL*
burning
of
the
last
;
it
would
not
have
stood
if
it
had
been
disputed
,
*NL*
and
you
may
be
sure
it
would
have
been
disputed
.
So
,
on
that
score
,
*NL*
you
may
feel
your
mind
free
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
Mr.
Farebrother
,
''
said
Mary
,
earnestly
.
``
I
am
grateful
to
*NL*
you
for
remembering
my
feelings
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
now
I
may
go
on
.
Fred
,
you
know
,
has
taken
his
degree
.
He
has
*NL*
worked
his
way
so
far
,
and
now
the
question
is
,
what
is
he
to
do
?
That
*NL*
question
is
so
difficult
that
he
is
inclined
to
follow
his
father
's
*NL*
wishes
and
enter
the
Church
,
though
you
know
better
than
I
do
that
he
*NL*
was
quite
set
against
that
formerly
.
I
have
questioned
him
on
the
*NL*
subject
,
and
I
confess
I
see
no
insuperable
objection
to
his
being
a
*NL*
clergyman
,
as
things
go
.
He
says
that
he
could
turn
his
mind
to
doing
*NL*
his
best
in
that
vocation
,
on
one
condition
.
If
that
condition
were
*NL*
fulfilled
I
would
do
my
utmost
in
helping
Fred
on
.
After
a
time
--
not
,
*NL*
of
course
,
at
first
--
he
might
be
with
me
as
my
curate
,
and
he
would
*NL*
have
so
much
to
do
that
his
stipend
would
be
nearly
what
I
used
to
get
*NL*
as
vicar
.
But
I
repeat
that
there
is
a
condition
without
which
all
*NL*
this
good
can
not
come
to
pass
.
He
has
opened
his
heart
to
me
,
Miss
*NL*
Garth
,
and
asked
me
to
plead
for
him
.
The
condition
lies
entirely
in
*NL*
your
feeling
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
looked
so
much
moved
,
that
he
said
after
a
moment
,
``
Let
us
walk
a
*NL*
little
;
''
and
when
they
were
walking
he
added
,
``
To
speak
quite
plainly

Fred
will
not
take
any
course
which
would
lessen
the
chance
that
you
*NL*
would
consent
to
be
his
wife

with
that
prospect
,
he
will
try
his
*NL*
best
at
anything
you
approve

*NL*
``
I
can
not
possibly
say
that
I

ever

Mr.
Farebrother

I
certainly
never
will
be
his
wife
if
he
becomes
a
clergyman

What
*NL*
you
say
is
most
generous
and
kind
;
I
do
n't
mean
for
a
moment
to
correct
*NL*
your
judgment

It
is
only
that
I
have
my
girlish
,
mocking
way
of
*NL*
looking
at
things
,
''
said
Mary
,
with
a
returning
sparkle
of
playfulness
*NL*
in
her
answer
which
only
made
its
modesty
more
charming
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
wishes
me
to
report
exactly
what
you
think
,
''
said
Mr.
Farebrother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
not
love
a
man
who
is
ridiculous
,
''
said
Mary
,
not
choosing
to
*NL*
go
deeper
.
``
Fred
has
sense
and
knowledge
enough
to
make
him
*NL*
respectable
,
if
he
likes
,
in
some
good
worldly
business
,
but
I
can
*NL*
never
imagine
him
preaching
and
exhorting
,
and
pronouncing
blessings
,
*NL*
and
praying
by
the
sick
,
without
feeling
as
if
I
were
looking
at
a
*NL*
caricature
.
His
being
a
clergyman
would
be
only
for
gentility
's
sake
,
*NL*
and
I
think
there
is
nothing
more
contemptible
than
such
imbecile
*NL*
gentility
.
I
used
to
think
that
of
Mr.
Crowse
,
with
his
empty
face
and
*NL*
neat
umbrella
,
and
mincing
little
speeches
.
What
right
have
such
men
*NL*
to
represent
Christianity
--
as
if
it
were
an
institution
for
getting
up
*NL*
idiots
genteelly
--
as
if
--
''
Mary
checked
herself
.
She
had
been
carried
*NL*
along
as
if
she
had
been
speaking
to
Fred
instead
of
Mr.
Farebrother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Young
women
are
severe
:
they
do
n't
feel
the
stress
of
action
as
men
*NL*
do
,
though
perhaps
I
ought
to
make
you
an
exception
there
.
But
you
*NL*
do
n't
put
Fred
Vincy
on
so
low
a
level
as
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
indeed
,
he
has
plenty
of
sense
,
but
I
think
he
would
not
show
it
*NL*
as
a
clergyman
.
He
would
be
a
piece
of
professional
affectation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
the
answer
is
quite
decided
.
As
a
clergyman
he
could
have
no
*NL*
hope
?

*NL*
*NL*
Mary
shook
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
if
he
braved
all
the
difficulties
of
getting
his
bread
in
some
*NL*
other

will
you
give
him
the
support
of
hope

May
he
count
on
*NL*
winning
you
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
Fred
ought
not
to
need
telling
again
what
I
have
already
said
*NL*
to
him
,
''
Mary
answered
,
with
a
slight
resentment
in
her
manner
.
``
I
*NL*
mean
that
he
ought
not
to
put
such
questions
until
he
has
done
*NL*
something
worthy
,
instead
of
saying
that
he
could
do
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Farebrother
was
silent
for
a
minute
or
more
,
and
then
,
as
they
*NL*
turned
and
paused
under
the
shadow
of
a
maple
at
the
end
of
a
grassy
*NL*
walk
,
said
,
``
I
understand
that
you
resist
any
attempt
to
fetter
you
,
*NL*
but
either
your
feeling
for
Fred
Vincy
excludes
your
entertaining
*NL*
another
attachment
,
or
it
does
not
:
either
he
may
count
on
your
*NL*
remaining
single
until
he
shall
have
earned
your
hand
,
or
he
may
in
any
*NL*
case
be
disappointed
.
Pardon
me
,
Mary
--
you
know
I
used
to
catechise
*NL*
you
under
that
name
--
but
when
the
state
of
a
woman
's
affections
touches
*NL*
the
happiness
of
another
life
--
of
more
lives
than
one
--
I
think
it
would
*NL*
be
the
nobler
course
for
her
to
be
perfectly
direct
and
open
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
in
her
turn
was
silent
,
wondering
not
at
Mr.
Farebrother
's
manner
*NL*
but
at
his
tone
,
which
had
a
grave
restrained
emotion
in
it
.
When
the
*NL*
strange
idea
flashed
across
her
that
his
words
had
reference
to
*NL*
himself
,
she
was
incredulous
,
and
ashamed
of
entertaining
it
.
She
had
*NL*
never
thought
that
any
man
could
love
her
except
Fred
,
who
had
espoused
*NL*
her
with
the
umbrella
ring
,
when
she
wore
socks
and
little
strapped
*NL*
shoes
;
still
less
that
she
could
be
of
any
importance
to
Mr.
*NL*
Farebrother
,
the
cleverest
man
in
her
narrow
circle
.
She
had
only
time
*NL*
to
feel
that
all
this
was
hazy
and
perhaps
illusory
;
but
one
thing
was
*NL*
clear
and
determined
--
her
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Since
you
think
it
my
duty
,
Mr.
Farebrother
,
I
will
tell
you
that
I
*NL*
have
too
strong
a
feeling
for
Fred
to
give
him
up
for
any
one
else
.
I
*NL*
should
never
be
quite
happy
if
I
thought
he
was
unhappy
for
the
loss
of
*NL*
me
.
It
has
taken
such
deep
root
in
me
--
my
gratitude
to
him
for
always
*NL*
loving
me
best
,
and
minding
so
much
if
I
hurt
myself
,
from
the
time
*NL*
when
we
were
very
little
.
I
can
not
imagine
any
new
feeling
coming
to
*NL*
make
that
weaker
.
I
should
like
better
than
anything
to
see
him
worthy
*NL*
of
every
one
's
respect
.
But
please
tell
him
I
will
not
promise
to
*NL*
marry
him
till
then
:
I
should
shame
and
grieve
my
father
and
mother
.
*NL*
He
is
free
to
choose
some
one
else
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
have
fulfilled
my
commission
thoroughly
,
''
said
Mr.
Farebrother
,
*NL*
putting
out
his
hand
to
Mary
,
``
and
I
shall
ride
back
to
Middlemarch
*NL*
forthwith
.
With
this
prospect
before
him
,
we
shall
get
Fred
into
the
*NL*
right
niche
somehow
,
and
I
hope
I
shall
live
to
join
your
hands
.
God
*NL*
bless
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
please
stay
,
and
let
me
give
you
some
tea
,
''
said
Mary
.
Her
eyes
*NL*
filled
with
tears
,
for
something
indefinable
,
something
like
the
*NL*
resolute
suppression
of
a
pain
in
Mr.
Farebrother
's
manner
,
made
her
*NL*
feel
suddenly
miserable
,
as
she
had
once
felt
when
she
saw
her
father
's
*NL*
hands
trembling
in
a
moment
of
trouble
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
my
dear
,
no
.
I
must
get
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
three
minutes
the
Vicar
was
on
horseback
again
,
having
gone
*NL*
magnanimously
through
a
duty
much
harder
than
the
renunciation
of
*NL*
whist
,
or
even
than
the
writing
of
penitential
meditations
.

CHAPTER
LIII
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
but
a
shallow
haste
which
concludeth
insincerity
from
*NL*
what
outsiders
call
inconsistency
--
putting
a
dead
mechanism
*NL*
of
``
ifs
''
and
``
therefores
''
for
the
living
myriad
of
hidden
*NL*
suckers
whereby
the
belief
and
the
conduct
are
wrought
into
*NL*
mutual
sustainment
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bulstrode
,
when
he
was
hoping
to
acquire
a
new
interest
in
Lowick
,
*NL*
had
naturally
had
an
especial
wish
that
the
new
clergyman
should
be
one
*NL*
whom
he
thoroughly
approved
;
and
he
believed
it
to
be
a
chastisement
*NL*
and
admonition
directed
to
his
own
shortcomings
and
those
of
the
nation
*NL*
at
large
,
that
just
about
the
time
when
he
came
in
possession
of
the
*NL*
deeds
which
made
him
the
proprietor
of
Stone
Court
,
Mr.
Farebrother
*NL*
``
read
himself
''
into
the
quaint
little
church
and
preached
his
first
*NL*
sermon
to
the
congregation
of
farmers
,
laborers
,
and
village
artisans
.
*NL*
It
was
not
that
Mr.
Bulstrode
intended
to
frequent
Lowick
Church
or
to
*NL*
reside
at
Stone
Court
for
a
good
while
to
come
:
he
had
bought
the
*NL*
excellent
farm
and
fine
homestead
simply
as
a
retreat
which
he
might
*NL*
gradually
enlarge
as
to
the
land
and
beautify
as
to
the
dwelling
,
until
*NL*
it
should
be
conducive
to
the
divine
glory
that
he
should
enter
on
it
*NL*
as
a
residence
,
partially
withdrawing
from
his
present
exertions
in
the
*NL*
administration
of
business
,
and
throwing
more
conspicuously
on
the
side
*NL*
of
Gospel
truth
the
weight
of
local
landed
proprietorship
,
which
*NL*
Providence
might
increase
by
unforeseen
occasions
of
purchase
.
A
*NL*
strong
leading
in
this
direction
seemed
to
have
been
given
in
the
*NL*
surprising
facility
of
getting
Stone
Court
,
when
every
one
had
expected
*NL*
that
Mr.
Rigg
Featherstone
would
have
clung
to
it
as
the
Garden
of
*NL*
Eden
.
That
was
what
poor
old
Peter
himself
had
expected
;
having
often
,
*NL*
in
imagination
,
looked
up
through
the
sods
above
him
,
and
,
unobstructed
*NL*
by
perspective
,
seen
his
frog-faced
legatee
enjoying
the
fine
old
*NL*
place
to
the
perpetual
surprise
and
disappointment
of
other
survivors
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
how
little
we
know
what
would
make
paradise
for
our
neighbors
!
We
*NL*
judge
from
our
own
desires
,
and
our
neighbors
themselves
are
not
always
*NL*
open
enough
even
to
throw
out
a
hint
of
theirs
.
The
cool
and
judicious
*NL*
Joshua
Rigg
had
not
allowed
his
parent
to
perceive
that
Stone
Court
was
*NL*
anything
less
than
the
chief
good
in
his
estimation
,
and
he
had
*NL*
certainly
wished
to
call
it
his
own
.
But
as
Warren
Hastings
looked
at
*NL*
gold
and
thought
of
buying
Daylesford
,
so
Joshua
Rigg
looked
at
Stone
*NL*
Court
and
thought
of
buying
gold
.
He
had
a
very
distinct
and
intense
*NL*
vision
of
his
chief
good
,
the
vigorous
greed
which
he
had
inherited
*NL*
having
taken
a
special
form
by
dint
of
circumstance
:
and
his
chief
good
*NL*
was
to
be
a
moneychanger
.
From
his
earliest
employment
as
an
*NL*
errand-boy
in
a
seaport
,
he
had
looked
through
the
windows
of
the
*NL*
moneychangers
as
other
boys
look
through
the
windows
of
the
*NL*
pastry-cooks
;
the
fascination
had
wrought
itself
gradually
into
a
deep
*NL*
special
passion
;
he
meant
,
when
he
had
property
,
to
do
many
things
,
one
*NL*
of
them
being
to
marry
a
genteel
young
person
;
but
these
were
all
*NL*
accidents
and
joys
that
imagination
could
dispense
with
.
The
one
joy
*NL*
after
which
his
soul
thirsted
was
to
have
a
money-changer
's
shop
on
a
*NL*
much-frequented
quay
,
to
have
locks
all
round
him
of
which
he
held
the
*NL*
keys
,
and
to
look
sublimely
cool
as
he
handled
the
breeding
coins
of
*NL*
all
nations
,
while
helpless
Cupidity
looked
at
him
enviously
from
the
*NL*
other
side
of
an
iron
lattice
.
The
strength
of
that
passion
had
been
a
*NL*
power
enabling
him
to
master
all
the
knowledge
necessary
to
gratify
it
.
*NL*
And
when
others
were
thinking
that
he
had
settled
at
Stone
Court
for
*NL*
life
,
Joshua
himself
was
thinking
that
the
moment
now
was
not
far
off
*NL*
when
he
should
settle
on
the
North
Quay
with
the
best
appointments
in
*NL*
safes
and
locks
.
*NL*
*NL*
Enough
.
We
are
concerned
with
looking
at
Joshua
Rigg
's
sale
of
his
*NL*
land
from
Mr.
Bulstrode
's
point
of
view
,
and
he
interpreted
it
as
a
*NL*
cheering
dispensation
conveying
perhaps
a
sanction
to
a
purpose
which
*NL*
he
had
for
some
time
entertained
without
external
encouragement
;
he
*NL*
interpreted
it
thus
,
but
not
too
confidently
,
offering
up
his
*NL*
thanksgiving
in
guarded
phraseology
.
His
doubts
did
not
arise
from
the
*NL*
possible
relations
of
the
event
to
Joshua
Rigg
's
destiny
,
which
*NL*
belonged
to
the
unmapped
regions
not
taken
under
the
providential
*NL*
government
,
except
perhaps
in
an
imperfect
colonial
way
;
but
they
arose
*NL*
from
reflecting
that
this
dispensation
too
might
be
a
chastisement
for
*NL*
himself
,
as
Mr.
Farebrother
's
induction
to
the
living
clearly
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
not
what
Mr.
Bulstrode
said
to
any
man
for
the
sake
of
*NL*
deceiving
him
:
it
was
what
he
said
to
himself
--
it
was
as
genuinely
his
*NL*
mode
of
explaining
events
as
any
theory
of
yours
may
be
,
if
you
happen
*NL*
to
disagree
with
him
.
For
the
egoism
which
enters
into
our
theories
*NL*
does
not
affect
their
sincerity
;
rather
,
the
more
our
egoism
is
*NL*
satisfied
,
the
more
robust
is
our
belief
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
whether
for
sanction
or
for
chastisement
,
Mr.
Bulstrode
,
*NL*
hardly
fifteen
months
after
the
death
of
Peter
Featherstone
,
had
become
*NL*
the
proprietor
of
Stone
Court
,
and
what
Peter
would
say
``
if
he
were
*NL*
worthy
to
know
,
''
had
become
an
inexhaustible
and
consolatory
subject
of
*NL*
conversation
to
his
disappointed
relatives
.
The
tables
were
now
turned
*NL*
on
that
dear
brother
departed
,
and
to
contemplate
the
frustration
of
*NL*
his
cunning
by
the
superior
cunning
of
things
in
general
was
a
cud
of
*NL*
delight
to
Solomon
.
Mrs.
Waule
had
a
melancholy
triumph
in
the
proof
*NL*
that
it
did
not
answer
to
make
false
Featherstones
and
cut
off
the
*NL*
genuine
;
and
Sister
Martha
receiving
the
news
in
the
Chalky
Flats
said
,
*NL*
``
Dear
,
dear
!
then
the
Almighty
could
have
been
none
so
pleased
with
the
*NL*
almshouses
after
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Affectionate
Mrs.
Bulstrode
was
particularly
glad
of
the
advantage
*NL*
which
her
husband
's
health
was
likely
to
get
from
the
purchase
of
Stone
*NL*
Court
.
Few
days
passed
without
his
riding
thither
and
looking
over
*NL*
some
part
of
the
farm
with
the
bailiff
,
and
the
evenings
were
delicious
*NL*
in
that
quiet
spot
,
when
the
new
hay-ricks
lately
set
up
were
sending
*NL*
forth
odors
to
mingle
with
the
breath
of
the
rich
old
garden
.
One
*NL*
evening
,
while
the
sun
was
still
above
the
horizon
and
burning
in
*NL*
golden
lamps
among
the
great
walnut
boughs
,
Mr.
Bulstrode
was
pausing
*NL*
on
horseback
outside
the
front
gate
waiting
for
Caleb
Garth
,
who
had
*NL*
met
him
by
appointment
to
give
an
opinion
on
a
question
of
stable
*NL*
drainage
,
and
was
now
advising
the
bailiff
in
the
rick-yard
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bulstrode
was
conscious
of
being
in
a
good
spiritual
frame
and
more
*NL*
than
usually
serene
,
under
the
influence
of
his
innocent
recreation
.
*NL*
He
was
doctrinally
convinced
that
there
was
a
total
absence
of
merit
in
*NL*
himself
;
but
that
doctrinal
conviction
may
be
held
without
pain
when
*NL*
the
sense
of
demerit
does
not
take
a
distinct
shape
in
memory
and
*NL*
revive
the
tingling
of
shame
or
the
pang
of
remorse
.
Nay
,
it
may
be
*NL*
held
with
intense
satisfaction
when
the
depth
of
our
sinning
is
but
a
*NL*
measure
for
the
depth
of
forgiveness
,
and
a
clenching
proof
that
we
are
*NL*
peculiar
instruments
of
the
divine
intention
.
The
memory
has
as
many
*NL*
moods
as
the
temper
,
and
shifts
its
scenery
like
a
diorama
.
At
this
*NL*
moment
Mr.
Bulstrode
felt
as
if
the
sunshine
were
all
one
with
that
of
*NL*
far-off
evenings
when
he
was
a
very
young
man
and
used
to
go
out
*NL*
preaching
beyond
Highbury
.
And
he
would
willingly
have
had
that
*NL*
service
of
exhortation
in
prospect
now
.
The
texts
were
there
still
,
*NL*
and
so
was
his
own
facility
in
expounding
them
.
His
brief
reverie
was
*NL*
interrupted
by
the
return
of
Caleb
Garth
,
who
also
was
on
horseback
,
*NL*
and
was
just
shaking
his
bridle
before
starting
,
when
he
exclaimed
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bless
my
heart
!
what
's
this
fellow
in
black
coming
along
the
lane
?
*NL*
He
's
like
one
of
those
men
one
sees
about
after
the
races
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bulstrode
turned
his
horse
and
looked
along
the
lane
,
but
made
no
*NL*
reply
.
The
comer
was
our
slight
acquaintance
Mr.
Raffles
,
whose
*NL*
appearance
presented
no
other
change
than
such
as
was
due
to
a
suit
of
*NL*
black
and
a
crape
hat-band
.
He
was
within
three
yards
of
the
horseman
*NL*
now
,
and
they
could
see
the
flash
of
recognition
in
his
face
as
he
*NL*
whirled
his
stick
upward
,
looking
all
the
while
at
Mr.
Bulstrode
,
and
*NL*
at
last
exclaiming
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
Jove
,
Nick
,
it
's
you
!
I
could
n't
be
mistaken
,
though
the
*NL*
five-and-twenty
years
have
played
old
Boguy
with
us
both
!
How
are
you
,
*NL*
eh
?
you
did
n't
expect
to
see
_
me
_
here
.
Come
,
shake
us
by
the
hand
.
''
*NL*
To
say
that
Mr.
Raffles
'
manner
was
rather
excited
would
be
only
one
*NL*
mode
of
saying
that
it
was
evening
.
Caleb
Garth
could
see
that
there
*NL*
was
a
moment
of
struggle
and
hesitation
in
Mr.
Bulstrode
,
but
it
ended
*NL*
in
his
putting
out
his
hand
coldly
to
Raffles
and
saying
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
not
indeed
expect
to
see
you
in
this
remote
country
place
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
it
belongs
to
a
stepson
of
mine
,
''
said
Raffles
,
adjusting
*NL*
himself
in
a
swaggering
attitude
.
``
I
came
to
see
him
here
before
.
I
'm
*NL*
not
so
surprised
at
seeing
you
,
old
fellow
,
because
I
picked
up
a
*NL*
letter
--
what
you
may
call
a
providential
thing
.
It
's
uncommonly
*NL*
fortunate
I
met
you
,
though
;
for
I
do
n't
care
about
seeing
my
stepson
:
*NL*
he
's
not
affectionate
,
and
his
poor
mother
's
gone
now
.
To
tell
the
*NL*
truth
,
I
came
out
of
love
to
you
,
Nick
:
I
came
to
get
your
address
,
*NL*
for
--
look
here
!
''
Raffles
drew
a
crumpled
paper
from
his
pocket
.
*NL*
*NL*
Almost
any
other
man
than
Caleb
Garth
might
have
been
tempted
to
linger
*NL*
on
the
spot
for
the
sake
of
hearing
all
he
could
about
a
man
whose
*NL*
acquaintance
with
Bulstrode
seemed
to
imply
passages
in
the
banker
's
*NL*
life
so
unlike
anything
that
was
known
of
him
in
Middlemarch
that
they
*NL*
must
have
the
nature
of
a
secret
to
pique
curiosity
.
But
Caleb
was
*NL*
peculiar
:
certain
human
tendencies
which
are
commonly
strong
were
*NL*
almost
absent
from
his
mind
;
and
one
of
these
was
curiosity
about
*NL*
personal
affairs
.
Especially
if
there
was
anything
discreditable
to
be
*NL*
found
out
concerning
another
man
,
Caleb
preferred
not
to
know
it
;
and
*NL*
if
he
had
to
tell
anybody
under
him
that
his
evil
doings
were
*NL*
discovered
,
he
was
more
embarrassed
than
the
culprit
.
He
now
spurred
*NL*
his
horse
,
and
saying
,
``
I
wish
you
good
evening
,
Mr.
Bulstrode
;
I
must
*NL*
be
getting
home
,
''
set
off
at
a
trot
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
did
n't
put
your
full
address
to
this
letter
,
''
Raffles
continued
.
*NL*
``
That
was
not
like
the
first-rate
man
of
business
you
used
to
be
.
`
The
*NL*
Shrubs
,
'
--
they
may
be
anywhere
:
you
live
near
at
hand
,
eh
?
--
have
cut
*NL*
the
London
concern
altogether
--
perhaps
turned
country
squire
--
have
a
*NL*
rural
mansion
to
invite
me
to
.
Lord
,
how
many
years
it
is
ago
!
The
*NL*
old
lady
must
have
been
dead
a
pretty
long
while
--
gone
to
glory
without
*NL*
the
pain
of
knowing
how
poor
her
daughter
was
,
eh
?
But
,
by
Jove
!
*NL*
you
're
very
pale
and
pasty
,
Nick
.
Come
,
if
you
're
going
home
,
I
'll
*NL*
walk
by
your
side
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bulstrode
's
usual
paleness
had
in
fact
taken
an
almost
deathly
hue
.
*NL*
Five
minutes
before
,
the
expanse
of
his
life
had
been
submerged
in
its
*NL*
evening
sunshine
which
shone
backward
to
its
remembered
morning
:
sin
*NL*
seemed
to
be
a
question
of
doctrine
and
inward
penitence
,
humiliation
*NL*
an
exercise
of
the
closet
,
the
bearing
of
his
deeds
a
matter
of
private
*NL*
vision
adjusted
solely
by
spiritual
relations
and
conceptions
of
the
*NL*
divine
purposes
.
And
now
,
as
if
by
some
hideous
magic
,
this
loud
red
*NL*
figure
had
risen
before
him
in
unmanageable
solidity
--
an
incorporate
*NL*
past
which
had
not
entered
into
his
imagination
of
chastisements
.
But
*NL*
Mr.
Bulstrode
's
thought
was
busy
,
and
he
was
not
a
man
to
act
or
speak
*NL*
rashly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
going
home
,
''
he
said
,
``
but
I
can
defer
my
ride
a
little
.
And
*NL*
you
can
,
if
you
please
,
rest
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
''
said
Raffles
,
making
a
grimace
.
``
I
do
n't
care
now
about
*NL*
seeing
my
stepson
.
I
'd
rather
go
home
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
stepson
,
if
Mr.
Rigg
Featherstone
was
he
,
is
here
no
longer
.
I
*NL*
am
master
here
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Raffles
opened
wide
eyes
,
and
gave
a
long
whistle
of
surprise
,
before
*NL*
he
said
,
``
Well
then
,
I
've
no
objection
.
I
've
had
enough
walking
from
*NL*
the
coach-road
.
I
never
was
much
of
a
walker
,
or
rider
either
.
What
I
*NL*
like
is
a
smart
vehicle
and
a
spirited
cob
.
I
was
always
a
little
*NL*
heavy
in
the
saddle
.
What
a
pleasant
surprise
it
must
be
to
you
to
see
*NL*
me
,
old
fellow
!
''
he
continued
,
as
they
turned
towards
the
house
.
``
You
*NL*
do
n't
say
so
;
but
you
never
took
your
luck
heartily
--
you
were
always
*NL*
thinking
of
improving
the
occasion
--
you
'd
such
a
gift
for
improving
*NL*
your
luck
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Raffles
seemed
greatly
to
enjoy
his
own
wit
,
and
swung
his
leg
in
a
*NL*
swaggering
manner
which
was
rather
too
much
for
his
companion
's
*NL*
judicious
patience
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
remember
rightly
,
''
Mr.
Bulstrode
observed
,
with
chill
anger
,
``
our
*NL*
acquaintance
many
years
ago
had
not
the
sort
of
intimacy
which
you
are
*NL*
now
assuming
,
Mr.
Raffles
.
Any
services
you
desire
of
me
will
be
the
*NL*
more
readily
rendered
if
you
will
avoid
a
tone
of
familiarity
which
did
*NL*
not
lie
in
our
former
intercourse
,
and
can
hardly
be
warranted
by
more
*NL*
than
twenty
years
of
separation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
like
being
called
Nick
?
Why
,
I
always
called
you
Nick
in
my
*NL*
heart
,
and
though
lost
to
sight
,
to
memory
dear
.
By
Jove
!
my
feelings
*NL*
have
ripened
for
you
like
fine
old
cognac
.
I
hope
you
've
got
some
in
*NL*
the
house
now
.
Josh
filled
my
flask
well
the
last
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bulstrode
had
not
yet
fully
learned
that
even
the
desire
for
cognac
*NL*
was
not
stronger
in
Raffles
than
the
desire
to
torment
,
and
that
a
hint
*NL*
of
annoyance
always
served
him
as
a
fresh
cue
.
But
it
was
at
least
*NL*
clear
that
further
objection
was
useless
,
and
Mr.
Bulstrode
,
in
giving
*NL*
orders
to
the
housekeeper
for
the
accommodation
of
the
guest
,
had
a
*NL*
resolute
air
of
quietude
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
the
comfort
of
thinking
that
this
housekeeper
had
been
in
the
*NL*
service
of
Rigg
also
,
and
might
accept
the
idea
that
Mr.
Bulstrode
*NL*
entertained
Raffles
merely
as
a
friend
of
her
former
master
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
there
was
food
and
drink
spread
before
his
visitor
in
the
*NL*
wainscoted
parlor
,
and
no
witness
in
the
room
,
Mr.
Bulstrode
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
habits
and
mine
are
so
different
,
Mr.
Raffles
,
that
we
can
hardly
*NL*
enjoy
each
other
's
society
.
The
wisest
plan
for
both
of
us
will
*NL*
therefore
be
to
part
as
soon
as
possible
.
Since
you
say
that
you
*NL*
wished
to
meet
me
,
you
probably
considered
that
you
had
some
business
*NL*
to
transact
with
me
.
But
under
the
circumstances
I
will
invite
you
to
*NL*
remain
here
for
the
night
,
and
I
will
myself
ride
over
here
early
*NL*
to-morrow
morning
--
before
breakfast
,
in
fact
,
when
I
can
receive
any
*NL*
Communication
you
have
to
make
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
all
my
heart
,
''
said
Raffles
;
``
this
is
a
comfortable
place
--
a
*NL*
little
dull
for
a
continuance
;
but
I
can
put
up
with
it
for
a
night
,
*NL*
with
this
good
liquor
and
the
prospect
of
seeing
you
again
in
the
*NL*
morning
.
You
're
a
much
better
host
than
my
stepson
was
;
but
Josh
owed
*NL*
me
a
bit
of
a
grudge
for
marrying
his
mother
;
and
between
you
and
me
*NL*
there
was
never
anything
but
kindness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bulstrode
,
hoping
that
the
peculiar
mixture
of
joviality
and
*NL*
sneering
in
Raffles
'
manner
was
a
good
deal
the
effect
of
drink
,
had
*NL*
determined
to
wait
till
he
was
quite
sober
before
he
spent
more
words
*NL*
upon
him
.
But
he
rode
home
with
a
terribly
lucid
vision
of
the
*NL*
difficulty
there
would
be
in
arranging
any
result
that
could
be
*NL*
permanently
counted
on
with
this
man
.
It
was
inevitable
that
he
should
*NL*
wish
to
get
rid
of
John
Raffles
,
though
his
reappearance
could
not
be
*NL*
regarded
as
lying
outside
the
divine
plan
.
The
spirit
of
evil
might
*NL*
have
sent
him
to
threaten
Mr.
Bulstrode
's
subversion
as
an
instrument
*NL*
of
good
;
but
the
threat
must
have
been
permitted
,
and
was
a
*NL*
chastisement
of
a
new
kind
.
It
was
an
hour
of
anguish
for
him
very
*NL*
different
from
the
hours
in
which
his
struggle
had
been
securely
*NL*
private
,
and
which
had
ended
with
a
sense
that
his
secret
misdeeds
were
*NL*
pardoned
and
his
services
accepted
.
Those
misdeeds
even
when
*NL*
committed
--
had
they
not
been
half
sanctified
by
the
singleness
of
his
*NL*
desire
to
devote
himself
and
all
he
possessed
to
the
furtherance
of
the
*NL*
divine
scheme
?
And
was
he
after
all
to
become
a
mere
stone
of
*NL*
stumbling
and
a
rock
of
offence
?
For
who
would
understand
the
work
*NL*
within
him
?
Who
would
not
,
when
there
was
the
pretext
of
casting
*NL*
disgrace
upon
him
,
confound
his
whole
life
and
the
truths
he
had
*NL*
espoused
,
in
one
heap
of
obloquy
?
*NL*
*NL*
In
his
closest
meditations
the
life-long
habit
of
Mr.
Bulstrode
's
mind
*NL*
clad
his
most
egoistic
terrors
in
doctrinal
references
to
superhuman
*NL*
ends
.
But
even
while
we
are
talking
and
meditating
about
the
earth
's
*NL*
orbit
and
the
solar
system
,
what
we
feel
and
adjust
our
movements
to
is
*NL*
the
stable
earth
and
the
changing
day
.
And
now
within
all
the
*NL*
automatic
succession
of
theoretic
phrases
--
distinct
and
inmost
as
the
*NL*
shiver
and
the
ache
of
oncoming
fever
when
we
are
discussing
abstract
*NL*
pain
,
was
the
forecast
of
disgrace
in
the
presence
of
his
neighbors
and
*NL*
of
his
own
wife
.
For
the
pain
,
as
well
as
the
public
estimate
of
*NL*
disgrace
,
depends
on
the
amount
of
previous
profession
.
To
men
who
*NL*
only
aim
at
escaping
felony
,
nothing
short
of
the
prisoner
's
dock
is
*NL*
disgrace
.
But
Mr.
Bulstrode
had
aimed
at
being
an
eminent
Christian
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
more
than
half-past
seven
in
the
morning
when
he
again
*NL*
reached
Stone
Court
.
The
fine
old
place
never
looked
more
like
a
*NL*
delightful
home
than
at
that
moment
;
the
great
white
lilies
were
in
*NL*
flower
,
the
nasturtiums
,
their
pretty
leaves
all
silvered
with
dew
,
*NL*
were
running
away
over
the
low
stone
wall
;
the
very
noises
all
around
*NL*
had
a
heart
of
peace
within
them
.
But
everything
was
spoiled
for
the
*NL*
owner
as
he
walked
on
the
gravel
in
front
and
awaited
the
descent
of
*NL*
Mr.
Raffles
,
with
whom
he
was
condemned
to
breakfast
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
long
before
they
were
seated
together
in
the
wainscoted
*NL*
parlor
over
their
tea
and
toast
,
which
was
as
much
as
Raffles
cared
to
*NL*
take
at
that
early
hour
.
The
difference
between
his
morning
and
*NL*
evening
self
was
not
so
great
as
his
companion
had
imagined
that
it
*NL*
might
be
;
the
delight
in
tormenting
was
perhaps
even
the
stronger
*NL*
because
his
spirits
were
rather
less
highly
pitched
.
Certainly
his
*NL*
manners
seemed
more
disagreeable
by
the
morning
light
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
I
have
little
time
to
spare
,
Mr.
Raffles
,
''
said
the
banker
,
who
*NL*
could
hardly
do
more
than
sip
his
tea
and
break
his
toast
without
*NL*
eating
it
,
``
I
shall
be
obliged
if
you
will
mention
at
once
the
ground
*NL*
on
which
you
wished
to
meet
with
me
.
I
presume
that
you
have
a
home
*NL*
elsewhere
and
will
be
glad
to
return
to
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
if
a
man
has
got
any
heart
,
does
n't
he
want
to
see
an
old
friend
,
*NL*
Nick
?
--
I
must
call
you
Nick
--
we
always
did
call
you
young
Nick
when
we
*NL*
knew
you
meant
to
marry
the
old
widow
.
Some
said
you
had
a
handsome
*NL*
family
likeness
to
old
Nick
,
but
that
was
your
mother
's
fault
,
calling
*NL*
you
Nicholas
.
Are
n't
you
glad
to
see
me
again
?
I
expected
an
invite
*NL*
to
stay
with
you
at
some
pretty
place
.
My
own
establishment
is
broken
*NL*
up
now
my
wife
's
dead
.
I
've
no
particular
attachment
to
any
spot
;
I
*NL*
would
as
soon
settle
hereabout
as
anywhere
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
I
ask
why
you
returned
from
America
?
I
considered
that
the
strong
*NL*
wish
you
expressed
to
go
there
,
when
an
adequate
sum
was
furnished
,
was
*NL*
tantamount
to
an
engagement
that
you
would
remain
there
for
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
knew
that
a
wish
to
go
to
a
place
was
the
same
thing
as
a
wish
*NL*
to
stay
.
But
I
did
stay
a
matter
of
ten
years
;
it
did
n't
suit
me
to
*NL*
stay
any
longer
.
And
I
'm
not
going
again
,
Nick
.
''
Here
Mr.
Raffles
*NL*
winked
slowly
as
he
looked
at
Mr.
Bulstrode
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
wish
to
be
settled
in
any
business
?
What
is
your
calling
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
my
calling
is
to
enjoy
myself
as
much
as
I
can
.
I
do
n't
*NL*
care
about
working
any
more
.
If
I
did
anything
it
would
be
a
little
*NL*
travelling
in
the
tobacco
line
--
or
something
of
that
sort
,
which
takes
*NL*
a
man
into
agreeable
company
.
But
not
without
an
independence
to
fall
*NL*
back
upon
.
That
's
what
I
want
:
I
'm
not
so
strong
as
I
was
,
Nick
,
*NL*
though
I
've
got
more
color
than
you
.
I
want
an
independence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
could
be
supplied
to
you
,
if
you
would
engage
to
keep
at
a
*NL*
distance
,
''
said
Mr.
Bulstrode
,
perhaps
with
a
little
too
much
eagerness
*NL*
in
his
undertone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
must
be
as
it
suits
my
convenience
,
''
said
Raffles
coolly
.
``
I
see
*NL*
no
reason
why
I
should
n't
make
a
few
acquaintances
hereabout
.
I
'm
not
*NL*
ashamed
of
myself
as
company
for
anybody
.
I
dropped
my
portmanteau
at
*NL*
the
turnpike
when
I
got
down
--
change
of
linen
--
genuine
--
honor
bright
--
more
*NL*
than
fronts
and
wristbands
;
and
with
this
suit
of
mourning
,
straps
*NL*
and
everything
,
I
should
do
you
credit
among
the
nobs
here
.
''
Mr.
*NL*
Raffles
had
pushed
away
his
chair
and
looked
down
at
himself
,
*NL*
particularly
at
his
straps
.
His
chief
intention
was
to
annoy
*NL*
Bulstrode
,
but
he
really
thought
that
his
appearance
now
would
produce
*NL*
a
good
effect
,
and
that
he
was
not
only
handsome
and
witty
,
but
clad
in
*NL*
a
mourning
style
which
implied
solid
connections
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
intend
to
rely
on
me
in
any
way
,
Mr.
Raffles
,
''
said
Bulstrode
,
*NL*
after
a
moment
's
pause
,
``
you
will
expect
to
meet
my
wishes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
to
be
sure
,
''
said
Raffles
,
with
a
mocking
cordiality
.
``
Did
n't
I
*NL*
always
do
it
?
Lord
,
you
made
a
pretty
thing
out
of
me
,
and
I
got
but
*NL*
little
.
I
've
often
thought
since
,
I
might
have
done
better
by
telling
*NL*
the
old
woman
that
I
'd
found
her
daughter
and
her
grandchild
:
it
would
*NL*
have
suited
my
feelings
better
;
I
've
got
a
soft
place
in
my
heart
.
But
*NL*
you
've
buried
the
old
lady
by
this
time
,
I
suppose
--
it
's
all
one
to
her
*NL*
now
.
And
you
've
got
your
fortune
out
of
that
profitable
business
which
*NL*
had
such
a
blessing
on
it
.
You
've
taken
to
being
a
nob
,
buying
land
,
*NL*
being
a
country
bashaw
.
Still
in
the
Dissenting
line
,
eh
?
Still
*NL*
godly
?
Or
taken
to
the
Church
as
more
genteel
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
time
Mr.
Raffles
'
slow
wink
and
slight
protrusion
of
his
tongue
*NL*
was
worse
than
a
nightmare
,
because
it
held
the
certitude
that
it
was
*NL*
not
a
nightmare
,
but
a
waking
misery
.
Mr.
Bulstrode
felt
a
shuddering
*NL*
nausea
,
and
did
not
speak
,
but
was
considering
diligently
whether
he
*NL*
should
not
leave
Raffles
to
do
as
he
would
,
and
simply
defy
him
as
a
*NL*
slanderer
.
The
man
would
soon
show
himself
disreputable
enough
to
make
*NL*
people
disbelieve
him
.
``
But
not
when
he
tells
any
ugly-looking
truth
*NL*
about
_
you
_
,
''
said
discerning
consciousness
.
And
again
:
it
seemed
no
*NL*
wrong
to
keep
Raffles
at
a
distance
,
but
Mr.
Bulstrode
shrank
from
the
*NL*
direct
falsehood
of
denying
true
statements
.
It
was
one
thing
to
look
*NL*
back
on
forgiven
sins
,
nay
,
to
explain
questionable
conformity
to
lax
*NL*
customs
,
and
another
to
enter
deliberately
on
the
necessity
of
*NL*
falsehood
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
since
Bulstrode
did
not
speak
,
Raffles
ran
on
,
by
way
of
using
time
*NL*
to
the
utmost
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
not
had
such
fine
luck
as
you
,
by
Jove
!
Things
went
confoundedly
*NL*
with
me
in
New
York
;
those
Yankees
are
cool
hands
,
and
a
man
of
*NL*
gentlemanly
feelings
has
no
chance
with
them
.
I
married
when
I
came
*NL*
back
--
a
nice
woman
in
the
tobacco
trade
--
very
fond
of
me
--
but
the
*NL*
trade
was
restricted
,
as
we
say
.
She
had
been
settled
there
a
good
*NL*
many
years
by
a
friend
;
but
there
was
a
son
too
much
in
the
case
.
Josh
*NL*
and
I
never
hit
it
off
.
However
,
I
made
the
most
of
the
position
,
and
*NL*
I
've
always
taken
my
glass
in
good
company
.
It
's
been
all
on
the
*NL*
square
with
me
;
I
'm
as
open
as
the
day
.
You
wo
n't
take
it
ill
of
me
*NL*
that
I
did
n't
look
you
up
before
.
I
've
got
a
complaint
that
makes
me
a
*NL*
little
dilatory
.
I
thought
you
were
trading
and
praying
away
in
London
*NL*
still
,
and
did
n't
find
you
there
.
But
you
see
I
was
sent
to
you
,
*NL*
Nick
--
perhaps
for
a
blessing
to
both
of
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Raffles
ended
with
a
jocose
snuffle
:
no
man
felt
his
intellect
more
*NL*
superior
to
religious
cant
.
And
if
the
cunning
which
calculates
on
the
*NL*
meanest
feelings
in
men
could
be
called
intellect
,
he
had
his
share
,
*NL*
for
under
the
blurting
rallying
tone
with
which
he
spoke
to
Bulstrode
,
*NL*
there
was
an
evident
selection
of
statements
,
as
if
they
had
been
so
*NL*
many
moves
at
chess
.
Meanwhile
Bulstrode
had
determined
on
his
move
,
*NL*
and
he
said
,
with
gathered
resolution
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
do
well
to
reflect
,
Mr.
Raffles
,
that
it
is
possible
for
a
*NL*
man
to
overreach
himself
in
the
effort
to
secure
undue
advantage
.
*NL*
Although
I
am
not
in
any
way
bound
to
you
,
I
am
willing
to
supply
you
*NL*
with
a
regular
annuity
--
in
quarterly
payments
--
so
long
as
you
fulfil
a
*NL*
promise
to
remain
at
a
distance
from
this
neighborhood
.
It
is
in
your
*NL*
power
to
choose
.
If
you
insist
on
remaining
here
,
even
for
a
short
*NL*
time
,
you
will
get
nothing
from
me
.
I
shall
decline
to
know
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ha
,
ha
!
''
said
Raffles
,
with
an
affected
explosion
,
``
that
reminds
me
of
*NL*
a
droll
dog
of
a
thief
who
declined
to
know
the
constable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
allusions
are
lost
on
me
sir
,
''
said
Bulstrode
,
with
white
heat
;
*NL*
``
the
law
has
no
hold
on
me
either
through
your
agency
or
any
other
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ca
n't
understand
a
joke
,
my
good
fellow
.
I
only
meant
that
I
*NL*
should
never
decline
to
know
you
.
But
let
us
be
serious
.
Your
*NL*
quarterly
payment
wo
n't
quite
suit
me
.
I
like
my
freedom
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
Raffles
rose
and
stalked
once
or
twice
up
and
down
the
room
,
*NL*
swinging
his
leg
,
and
assuming
an
air
of
masterly
meditation
.
At
last
*NL*
he
stopped
opposite
Bulstrode
,
and
said
,
``
I
'll
tell
you
what
!
Give
us
*NL*
a
couple
of
hundreds
--
come
,
that
's
modest
--
and
I
'll
go
away
--
honor
*NL*
bright
!
--
pick
up
my
portmanteau
and
go
away
.
But
I
shall
not
give
up
*NL*
my
Liberty
for
a
dirty
annuity
.
I
shall
come
and
go
where
I
like
.
*NL*
Perhaps
it
may
suit
me
to
stay
away
,
and
correspond
with
a
friend
;
*NL*
perhaps
not
.
Have
you
the
money
with
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
have
one
hundred
,
''
said
Bulstrode
,
feeling
the
immediate
*NL*
riddance
too
great
a
relief
to
be
rejected
on
the
ground
of
future
*NL*
uncertainties
.
``
I
will
forward
you
the
other
if
you
will
mention
an
*NL*
address
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
'll
wait
here
till
you
bring
it
,
''
said
Raffles
.
``
I
'll
take
a
*NL*
stroll
and
have
a
snack
,
and
you
'll
be
back
by
that
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bulstrode
's
sickly
body
,
shattered
by
the
agitations
he
had
gone
*NL*
through
since
the
last
evening
,
made
him
feel
abjectly
in
the
power
of
*NL*
this
loud
invulnerable
man
.
At
that
moment
he
snatched
at
a
temporary
*NL*
repose
to
be
won
on
any
terms
.
He
was
rising
to
do
what
Raffles
*NL*
suggested
,
when
the
latter
said
,
lifting
up
his
finger
as
if
with
a
*NL*
sudden
recollection
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
have
another
look
after
Sarah
again
,
though
I
did
n't
tell
you
;
*NL*
I
'd
a
tender
conscience
about
that
pretty
young
woman
.
I
did
n't
find
*NL*
her
,
but
I
found
out
her
husband
's
name
,
and
I
made
a
note
of
it
.
But
*NL*
hang
it
,
I
lost
my
pocketbook
.
However
,
if
I
heard
it
,
I
should
know
*NL*
it
again
.
I
've
got
my
faculties
as
if
I
was
in
my
prime
,
but
names
*NL*
wear
out
,
by
Jove
!
Sometimes
I
'm
no
better
than
a
confounded
tax-paper
*NL*
before
the
names
are
filled
in
.
However
,
if
I
hear
of
her
and
her
*NL*
family
,
you
shall
know
,
Nick
.
You
'd
like
to
do
something
for
her
,
now
*NL*
she
's
your
step-daughter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Doubtless
,
''
said
Mr.
Bulstrode
,
with
the
usual
steady
look
of
his
*NL*
light-gray
eyes
;
``
though
that
might
reduce
my
power
of
assisting
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
walked
out
of
the
room
,
Raffles
winked
slowly
at
his
back
,
and
*NL*
then
turned
towards
the
window
to
watch
the
banker
riding
away
--
virtually
*NL*
at
his
command
.
His
lips
first
curled
with
a
smile
and
then
opened
*NL*
with
a
short
triumphant
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
the
deuce
was
the
name
?
''
he
presently
said
,
half
aloud
,
*NL*
scratching
his
head
,
and
wrinkling
his
brows
horizontally
.
He
had
not
*NL*
really
cared
or
thought
about
this
point
of
forgetfulness
until
it
*NL*
occurred
to
him
in
his
invention
of
annoyances
for
Bulstrode
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
began
with
L
;
it
was
almost
all
l
's
I
fancy
,
''
he
went
on
,
with
a
*NL*
sense
that
he
was
getting
hold
of
the
slippery
name
.
But
the
hold
was
*NL*
too
slight
,
and
he
soon
got
tired
of
this
mental
chase
;
for
few
men
*NL*
were
more
impatient
of
private
occupation
or
more
in
need
of
making
*NL*
themselves
continually
heard
than
Mr.
Raffles
.
He
preferred
using
his
*NL*
time
in
pleasant
conversation
with
the
bailiff
and
the
housekeeper
,
*NL*
from
whom
he
gathered
as
much
as
he
wanted
to
know
about
Mr.
*NL*
Bulstrode
's
position
in
Middlemarch
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
all
,
however
,
there
was
a
dull
space
of
time
which
needed
*NL*
relieving
with
bread
and
cheese
and
ale
,
and
when
he
was
seated
alone
*NL*
with
these
resources
in
the
wainscoted
parlor
,
he
suddenly
slapped
his
*NL*
knee
,
and
exclaimed
,
``
Ladislaw
!
''
That
action
of
memory
which
he
had
*NL*
tried
to
set
going
,
and
had
abandoned
in
despair
,
had
suddenly
*NL*
completed
itself
without
conscious
effort
--
a
common
experience
,
*NL*
agreeable
as
a
completed
sneeze
,
even
if
the
name
remembered
is
of
no
*NL*
value
.
Raffles
immediately
took
out
his
pocket-book
,
and
wrote
down
*NL*
the
name
,
not
because
he
expected
to
use
it
,
but
merely
for
the
sake
of
*NL*
not
being
at
a
loss
if
he
ever
did
happen
to
want
it
.
He
was
not
going
*NL*
to
tell
Bulstrode
:
there
was
no
actual
good
in
telling
,
and
to
a

DANTE

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
By
that
delightful
morning
when
the
hay-ricks
at
Stone
Court
were
*NL*
scenting
the
air
quite
impartially
,
as
if
Mr.
Raffles
had
been
a
guest
*NL*
worthy
of
finest
incense
,
Dorothea
had
again
taken
up
her
abode
at
*NL*
Lowick
Manor
.
After
three
months
Freshitt
had
become
rather
*NL*
oppressive
:
to
sit
like
a
model
for
Saint
Catherine
looking
rapturously
*NL*
at
Celia
's
baby
would
not
do
for
many
hours
in
the
day
,
and
to
remain
*NL*
in
that
momentous
babe
's
presence
with
persistent
disregard
was
a
*NL*
course
that
could
not
have
been
tolerated
in
a
childless
sister
.
*NL*
Dorothea
would
have
been
capable
of
carrying
baby
joyfully
for
a
mile
*NL*
if
there
had
been
need
,
and
of
loving
it
the
more
tenderly
for
that
*NL*
labor
;
but
to
an
aunt
who
does
not
recognize
her
infant
nephew
as
*NL*
Bouddha
,
and
has
nothing
to
do
for
him
but
to
admire
,
his
behavior
is
*NL*
apt
to
appear
monotonous
,
and
the
interest
of
watching
him
exhaustible
.
*NL*
This
possibility
was
quite
hidden
from
Celia
,
who
felt
that
Dorothea
's
*NL*
childless
widowhood
fell
in
quite
prettily
with
the
birth
of
little
*NL*
Arthur
-LRB-
baby
was
named
after
Mr.
Brooke
-RRB-
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dodo
is
just
the
creature
not
to
mind
about
having
anything
of
her
*NL*
own
--
children
or
anything
!
''
said
Celia
to
her
husband
.
``
And
if
she
*NL*
had
had
a
baby
,
it
never
could
have
been
such
a
dear
as
Arthur
.
Could
*NL*
it
,
James
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
if
it
had
been
like
Casaubon
,
''
said
Sir
James
,
conscious
of
some
*NL*
indirectness
in
his
answer
,
and
of
holding
a
strictly
private
opinion
*NL*
as
to
the
perfections
of
his
first-born
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
!
just
imagine
!
Really
it
was
a
mercy
,
''
said
Celia
;
``
and
I
think
it
*NL*
is
very
nice
for
Dodo
to
be
a
widow
.
She
can
be
just
as
fond
of
our
*NL*
baby
as
if
it
were
her
own
,
and
she
can
have
as
many
notions
of
her
own
*NL*
as
she
likes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
pity
she
was
not
a
queen
,
''
said
the
devout
Sir
James
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
should
we
have
been
then
?
We
must
have
been
something
else
,
''
*NL*
said
Celia
,
objecting
to
so
laborious
a
flight
of
imagination
.
``
I
like
*NL*
her
better
as
she
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hence
,
when
she
found
that
Dorothea
was
making
arrangements
for
her
*NL*
final
departure
to
Lowick
,
Celia
raised
her
eyebrows
with
*NL*
disappointment
,
and
in
her
quiet
unemphatic
way
shot
a
needle-arrow
of
*NL*
sarcasm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
will
you
do
at
Lowick
,
Dodo
?
You
say
yourself
there
is
nothing
*NL*
to
be
done
there
:
everybody
is
so
clean
and
well
off
,
it
makes
you
*NL*
quite
melancholy
.
And
here
you
have
been
so
happy
going
all
about
*NL*
Tipton
with
Mr.
Garth
into
the
worst
backyards
.
And
now
uncle
is
*NL*
abroad
,
you
and
Mr.
Garth
can
have
it
all
your
own
way
;
and
I
am
sure
*NL*
James
does
everything
you
tell
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
often
come
here
,
and
I
shall
see
how
baby
grows
all
the
*NL*
better
,
''
said
Dorothea
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
will
never
see
him
washed
,
''
said
Celia
;
``
and
that
is
quite
the
*NL*
best
part
of
the
day
.
''
She
was
almost
pouting
:
it
did
seem
to
her
very
*NL*
hard
in
Dodo
to
go
away
from
the
baby
when
she
might
stay
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
Kitty
,
I
will
come
and
stay
all
night
on
purpose
,
''
said
Dorothea
;
*NL*
``
but
I
want
to
be
alone
now
,
and
in
my
own
home
.
I
wish
to
know
the
*NL*
Farebrothers
better
,
and
to
talk
to
Mr.
Farebrother
about
what
there
is
*NL*
to
be
done
in
Middlemarch
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
's
native
strength
of
will
was
no
longer
all
converted
into
*NL*
resolute
submission
.
She
had
a
great
yearning
to
be
at
Lowick
,
and
was
*NL*
simply
determined
to
go
,
not
feeling
bound
to
tell
all
her
reasons
.
*NL*
But
every
one
around
her
disapproved
.
Sir
James
was
much
pained
,
and
*NL*
offered
that
they
should
all
migrate
to
Cheltenham
for
a
few
months
*NL*
with
the
sacred
ark
,
otherwise
called
a
cradle
:
at
that
period
a
man
*NL*
could
hardly
know
what
to
propose
if
Cheltenham
were
rejected
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Dowager
Lady
Chettam
,
just
returned
from
a
visit
to
her
daughter
in
*NL*
town
,
wished
,
at
least
,
that
Mrs.
Vigo
should
be
written
to
,
and
*NL*
invited
to
accept
the
office
of
companion
to
Mrs.
Casaubon
:
it
was
not
*NL*
credible
that
Dorothea
as
a
young
widow
would
think
of
living
alone
in
*NL*
the
house
at
Lowick
.
Mrs.
Vigo
had
been
reader
and
secretary
to
royal
*NL*
personages
,
and
in
point
of
knowledge
and
sentiments
even
Dorothea
*NL*
could
have
nothing
to
object
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Cadwallader
said
,
privately
,
``
You
will
certainly
go
mad
in
that
*NL*
house
alone
,
my
dear
.
You
will
see
visions
.
We
have
all
got
to
exert
*NL*
ourselves
a
little
to
keep
sane
,
and
call
things
by
the
same
names
as
*NL*
other
people
call
them
by
.
To
be
sure
,
for
younger
sons
and
women
who
*NL*
have
no
money
,
it
is
a
sort
of
provision
to
go
mad
:
they
are
taken
care
*NL*
of
then
.
But
you
must
not
run
into
that
.
I
dare
say
you
are
a
little
*NL*
bored
here
with
our
good
dowager
;
but
think
what
a
bore
you
might
*NL*
become
yourself
to
your
fellow-creatures
if
you
were
always
playing
*NL*
tragedy
queen
and
taking
things
sublimely
.
Sitting
alone
in
that
*NL*
library
at
Lowick
you
may
fancy
yourself
ruling
the
weather
;
you
must
*NL*
get
a
few
people
round
you
who
would
n't
believe
you
if
you
told
them
.
*NL*
That
is
a
good
lowering
medicine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
called
everything
by
the
same
name
that
all
the
people
about
*NL*
me
did
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
stoutly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
suppose
you
have
found
out
your
mistake
,
my
dear
,
''
said
Mrs.
*NL*
Cadwallader
,
``
and
that
is
a
proof
of
sanity
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
was
aware
of
the
sting
,
but
it
did
not
hurt
her
.
``
No
,
''
she
*NL*
said
,
``
I
still
think
that
the
greater
part
of
the
world
is
mistaken
*NL*
about
many
things
.
Surely
one
may
be
sane
and
yet
think
so
,
since
the
*NL*
greater
part
of
the
world
has
often
had
to
come
round
from
its
opinion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Cadwallader
said
no
more
on
that
point
to
Dorothea
,
but
to
her
*NL*
husband
she
remarked
,
``
It
will
be
well
for
her
to
marry
again
as
soon
*NL*
as
it
is
proper
,
if
one
could
get
her
among
the
right
people
.
Of
*NL*
course
the
Chettams
would
not
wish
it
.
But
I
see
clearly
a
husband
is
*NL*
the
best
thing
to
keep
her
in
order
.
If
we
were
not
so
poor
I
would
*NL*
invite
Lord
Triton
.
He
will
be
marquis
some
day
,
and
there
is
no
*NL*
denying
that
she
would
make
a
good
marchioness
:
she
looks
handsomer
*NL*
than
ever
in
her
mourning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Elinor
,
do
let
the
poor
woman
alone
.
Such
contrivances
are
of
*NL*
no
use
,
''
said
the
easy
Rector
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
use
?
How
are
matches
made
,
except
by
bringing
men
and
women
*NL*
together
?
And
it
is
a
shame
that
her
uncle
should
have
run
away
and
*NL*
shut
up
the
Grange
just
now
.
There
ought
to
be
plenty
of
eligible
*NL*
matches
invited
to
Freshitt
and
the
Grange
.
Lord
Triton
is
precisely
*NL*
the
man
:
full
of
plans
for
making
the
people
happy
in
a
soft-headed
*NL*
sort
of
way
.
That
would
just
suit
Mrs.
Casaubon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
Mrs.
Casaubon
choose
for
herself
,
Elinor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
the
nonsense
you
wise
men
talk
!
How
can
she
choose
if
she
has
*NL*
no
variety
to
choose
from
?
A
woman
's
choice
usually
means
taking
the
*NL*
only
man
she
can
get
.
Mark
my
words
,
Humphrey
.
If
her
friends
do
n't
*NL*
exert
themselves
,
there
will
be
a
worse
business
than
the
Casaubon
*NL*
business
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
heaven
's
sake
do
n't
touch
on
that
topic
,
Elinor
!
It
is
a
very
sore
*NL*
point
with
Sir
James
.
He
would
be
deeply
offended
if
you
entered
on
it
*NL*
to
him
unnecessarily
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
never
entered
on
it
,
''
said
Mrs
Cadwallader
,
opening
her
hands
.
*NL*
``
Celia
told
me
all
about
the
will
at
the
beginning
,
without
any
asking
*NL*
of
mine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
;
but
they
want
the
thing
hushed
up
,
and
I
understand
that
the
*NL*
young
fellow
is
going
out
of
the
neighborhood
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Cadwallader
said
nothing
,
but
gave
her
husband
three
significant
*NL*
nods
,
with
a
very
sarcastic
expression
in
her
dark
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
quietly
persisted
in
spite
of
remonstrance
and
persuasion
.
So
*NL*
by
the
end
of
June
the
shutters
were
all
opened
at
Lowick
Manor
,
and
*NL*
the
morning
gazed
calmly
into
the
library
,
shining
on
the
rows
of
*NL*
note-books
as
it
shines
on
the
weary
waste
planted
with
huge
stones
,
*NL*
the
mute
memorial
of
a
forgotten
faith
;
and
the
evening
laden
with
*NL*
roses
entered
silently
into
the
blue-green
boudoir
where
Dorothea
chose
*NL*
oftenest
to
sit
.
At
first
she
walked
into
every
room
,
questioning
the
*NL*
eighteen
months
of
her
married
life
,
and
carrying
on
her
thoughts
as
if
*NL*
they
were
a
speech
to
be
heard
by
her
husband
.
Then
,
she
lingered
in
*NL*
the
library
and
could
not
be
at
rest
till
she
had
carefully
ranged
all
*NL*
the
note-books
as
she
imagined
that
he
would
wish
to
see
them
,
in
*NL*
orderly
sequence
.
The
pity
which
had
been
the
restraining
compelling
*NL*
motive
in
her
life
with
him
still
clung
about
his
image
,
even
while
she
*NL*
remonstrated
with
him
in
indignant
thought
and
told
him
that
he
was
*NL*
unjust
.
One
little
act
of
hers
may
perhaps
be
smiled
at
as
*NL*
superstitious
.
The
Synoptical
Tabulation
for
the
use
of
Mrs.
Casaubon
,
*NL*
she
carefully
enclosed
and
sealed
,
writing
within
the
envelope
,
``
I
*NL*
could
not
use
it
.
Do
you
not
see
now
that
I
could
not
submit
my
soul
*NL*
to
yours
,
by
working
hopelessly
at
what
I
have
no
belief
in
--
Dorothea
?
''
*NL*
Then
she
deposited
the
paper
in
her
own
desk
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
silent
colloquy
was
perhaps
only
the
more
earnest
because
*NL*
underneath
and
through
it
all
there
was
always
the
deep
longing
which
*NL*
had
really
determined
her
to
come
to
Lowick
.
The
longing
was
to
see
*NL*
Will
Ladislaw
.
She
did
not
know
any
good
that
could
come
of
their
*NL*
meeting
:
she
was
helpless
;
her
hands
had
been
tied
from
making
up
to
*NL*
him
for
any
unfairness
in
his
lot
.
But
her
soul
thirsted
to
see
him
.
*NL*
How
could
it
be
otherwise
?
If
a
princess
in
the
days
of
enchantment
*NL*
had
seen
a
four-footed
creature
from
among
those
which
live
in
herds
*NL*
come
to
her
once
and
again
with
a
human
gaze
which
rested
upon
her
with
*NL*
choice
and
beseeching
,
what
would
she
think
of
in
her
journeying
,
what
*NL*
would
she
look
for
when
the
herds
passed
her
?
Surely
for
the
gaze
*NL*
which
had
found
her
,
and
which
she
would
know
again
.
Life
would
be
no
*NL*
better
than
candle-light
tinsel
and
daylight
rubbish
if
our
spirits
*NL*
were
not
touched
by
what
has
been
,
to
issues
of
longing
and
constancy
.
*NL*
It
was
true
that
Dorothea
wanted
to
know
the
Farebrothers
better
,
and
*NL*
especially
to
talk
to
the
new
rector
,
but
also
true
that
remembering
*NL*
what
Lydgate
had
told
her
about
Will
Ladislaw
and
little
Miss
Noble
,
*NL*
she
counted
on
Will
's
coming
to
Lowick
to
see
the
Farebrother
family
.
*NL*
The
very
first
Sunday
,
_
before
_
she
entered
the
church
,
she
saw
him
as
*NL*
she
had
seen
him
the
last
time
she
was
there
,
alone
in
the
clergyman
's
*NL*
pew
;
but
_
when
_
she
entered
his
figure
was
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
week-days
when
she
went
to
see
the
ladies
at
the
Rectory
,
she
*NL*
listened
in
vain
for
some
word
that
they
might
let
fall
about
Will
;
but
*NL*
it
seemed
to
her
that
Mrs.
Farebrother
talked
of
every
one
else
in
the
*NL*
neighborhood
and
out
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Probably
some
of
Mr.
Farebrother
's
Middlemarch
hearers
may
follow
him
*NL*
to
Lowick
sometimes
.
Do
you
not
think
so
?
''
said
Dorothea
,
rather
*NL*
despising
herself
for
having
a
secret
motive
in
asking
the
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
they
are
wise
they
will
,
Mrs.
Casaubon
,
''
said
the
old
lady
.
``
I
see
*NL*
that
you
set
a
right
value
on
my
son
's
preaching
.
His
grandfather
on
*NL*
my
side
was
an
excellent
clergyman
,
but
his
father
was
in
the
law
:
--
most
*NL*
exemplary
and
honest
nevertheless
,
which
is
a
reason
for
our
never
*NL*
being
rich
.
They
say
Fortune
is
a
woman
and
capricious
.
But
sometimes
*NL*
she
is
a
good
woman
and
gives
to
those
who
merit
,
which
has
been
the
*NL*
case
with
you
,
Mrs.
Casaubon
,
who
have
given
a
living
to
my
son
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Farebrother
recurred
to
her
knitting
with
a
dignified
satisfaction
*NL*
in
her
neat
little
effort
at
oratory
,
but
this
was
not
what
Dorothea
*NL*
wanted
to
hear
.
Poor
thing
!
she
did
not
even
know
whether
Will
*NL*
Ladislaw
was
still
at
Middlemarch
,
and
there
was
no
one
whom
she
dared
*NL*
to
ask
,
unless
it
were
Lydgate
.
But
just
now
she
could
not
see
Lydgate
*NL*
without
sending
for
him
or
going
to
seek
him
.
Perhaps
Will
Ladislaw
,
*NL*
having
heard
of
that
strange
ban
against
him
left
by
Mr.
Casaubon
,
had
*NL*
felt
it
better
that
he
and
she
should
not
meet
again
,
and
perhaps
she
*NL*
was
wrong
to
wish
for
a
meeting
that
others
might
find
many
good
*NL*
reasons
against
.
Still
``
I
do
wish
it
''
came
at
the
end
of
those
wise
*NL*
reflections
as
naturally
as
a
sob
after
holding
the
breath
.
And
the
*NL*
meeting
did
happen
,
but
in
a
formal
way
quite
unexpected
by
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
morning
,
about
eleven
,
Dorothea
was
seated
in
her
boudoir
with
a
*NL*
map
of
the
land
attached
to
the
manor
and
other
papers
before
her
,
*NL*
which
were
to
help
her
in
making
an
exact
statement
for
herself
of
her
*NL*
income
and
affairs
.
She
had
not
yet
applied
herself
to
her
work
,
but
*NL*
was
seated
with
her
hands
folded
on
her
lap
,
looking
out
along
the
*NL*
avenue
of
limes
to
the
distant
fields
.
Every
leaf
was
at
rest
in
the
*NL*
sunshine
,
the
familiar
scene
was
changeless
,
and
seemed
to
represent
*NL*
the
prospect
of
her
life
,
full
of
motiveless
ease
--
motiveless
,
if
her
*NL*
own
energy
could
not
seek
out
reasons
for
ardent
action
.
The
widow
's
*NL*
cap
of
those
times
made
an
oval
frame
for
the
face
,
and
had
a
crown
*NL*
standing
up
;
the
dress
was
an
experiment
in
the
utmost
laying
on
of
*NL*
crape
;
but
this
heavy
solemnity
of
clothing
made
her
face
look
all
the
*NL*
younger
,
with
its
recovered
bloom
,
and
the
sweet
,
inquiring
candor
of
*NL*
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
reverie
was
broken
by
Tantripp
,
who
came
to
say
that
Mr.
Ladislaw
*NL*
was
below
,
and
begged
permission
to
see
Madam
if
it
were
not
too
early
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
see
him
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
rising
immediately
.
``
Let
him
be
shown
*NL*
into
the
drawing-room
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
drawing-room
was
the
most
neutral
room
in
the
house
to
her
--
the
*NL*
one
least
associated
with
the
trials
of
her
married
life
:
the
damask
*NL*
matched
the
wood-work
,
which
was
all
white
and
gold
;
there
were
two
*NL*
tall
mirrors
and
tables
with
nothing
on
them
--
in
brief
,
it
was
a
room
*NL*
where
you
had
no
reason
for
sitting
in
one
place
rather
than
in
*NL*
another
.
It
was
below
the
boudoir
,
and
had
also
a
bow-window
looking
*NL*
out
on
the
avenue
.
But
when
Pratt
showed
Will
Ladislaw
into
it
the
*NL*
window
was
open
;
and
a
winged
visitor
,
buzzing
in
and
out
now
and
then
*NL*
without
minding
the
furniture
,
made
the
room
look
less
formal
and
*NL*
uninhabited
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Glad
to
see
you
here
again
,
sir
,
''
said
Pratt
,
lingering
to
adjust
a
*NL*
blind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
only
come
to
say
good-by
,
Pratt
,
''
said
Will
,
who
wished
even
the
*NL*
butler
to
know
that
he
was
too
proud
to
hang
about
Mrs.
Casaubon
now
*NL*
she
was
a
rich
widow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
sorry
to
hear
it
,
sir
,
''
said
Pratt
,
retiring
.
Of
course
,
as
a
*NL*
servant
who
was
to
be
told
nothing
,
he
knew
the
fact
of
which
Ladislaw
*NL*
was
still
ignorant
,
and
had
drawn
his
inferences
;
indeed
,
had
not
*NL*
differed
from
his
betrothed
Tantripp
when
she
said
,
``
Your
master
was
as
*NL*
jealous
as
a
fiend
--
and
no
reason
.
Madam
would
look
higher
than
Mr.
*NL*
Ladislaw
,
else
I
do
n't
know
her
.
Mrs.
Cadwallader
's
maid
says
there
's
*NL*
a
lord
coming
who
is
to
marry
her
when
the
mourning
's
over
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
not
many
moments
for
Will
to
walk
about
with
his
hat
in
his
*NL*
hand
before
Dorothea
entered
.
The
meeting
was
very
different
from
that
*NL*
first
meeting
in
Rome
when
Will
had
been
embarrassed
and
Dorothea
calm
.
*NL*
This
time
he
felt
miserable
but
determined
,
while
she
was
in
a
state
of
*NL*
agitation
which
could
not
be
hidden
.
Just
outside
the
door
she
had
*NL*
felt
that
this
longed-for
meeting
was
after
all
too
difficult
,
and
when
*NL*
she
saw
Will
advancing
towards
her
,
the
deep
blush
which
was
rare
in
*NL*
her
came
with
painful
suddenness
.
Neither
of
them
knew
how
it
was
,
but
*NL*
neither
of
them
spoke
.
She
gave
her
hand
for
a
moment
,
and
then
they
*NL*
went
to
sit
down
near
the
window
,
she
on
one
settee
and
he
on
another
*NL*
opposite
.
Will
was
peculiarly
uneasy
:
it
seemed
to
him
not
like
*NL*
Dorothea
that
the
mere
fact
of
her
being
a
widow
should
cause
such
a
*NL*
change
in
her
manner
of
receiving
him
;
and
he
knew
of
no
other
*NL*
condition
which
could
have
affected
their
previous
relation
to
each
*NL*
other
--
except
that
,
as
his
imagination
at
once
told
him
,
her
friends
*NL*
might
have
been
poisoning
her
mind
with
their
suspicions
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
I
have
not
presumed
too
much
in
calling
,
''
said
Will
;
``
I
could
*NL*
not
bear
to
leave
the
neighborhood
and
begin
a
new
life
without
seeing
*NL*
you
to
say
good-by
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Presumed
?
Surely
not
.
I
should
have
thought
it
unkind
if
you
had
not
*NL*
wished
to
see
me
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
her
habit
of
speaking
with
perfect
*NL*
genuineness
asserting
itself
through
all
her
uncertainty
and
agitation
.
*NL*
``
Are
you
going
away
immediately
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
soon
,
I
think
.
I
intend
to
go
to
town
and
eat
my
dinners
as
a
*NL*
barrister
,
since
,
they
say
,
that
is
the
preparation
for
all
public
*NL*
business
.
There
will
be
a
great
deal
of
political
work
to
be
done
*NL*
by-and-by
,
and
I
mean
to
try
and
do
some
of
it
.
Other
men
have
managed
*NL*
to
win
an
honorable
position
for
themselves
without
family
or
money
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
that
will
make
it
all
the
more
honorable
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
*NL*
ardently
.
``
Besides
,
you
have
so
many
talents
.
I
have
heard
from
my
*NL*
uncle
how
well
you
speak
in
public
,
so
that
every
one
is
sorry
when
you
*NL*
leave
off
,
and
how
clearly
you
can
explain
things
.
And
you
care
that
*NL*
justice
should
be
done
to
every
one
.
I
am
so
glad
.
When
we
were
in
*NL*
Rome
,
I
thought
you
only
cared
for
poetry
and
art
,
and
the
things
that
*NL*
adorn
life
for
us
who
are
well
off
.
But
now
I
know
you
think
about
the
*NL*
rest
of
the
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
she
was
speaking
Dorothea
had
lost
her
personal
embarrassment
,
*NL*
and
had
become
like
her
former
self
.
She
looked
at
Will
with
a
direct
*NL*
glance
,
full
of
delighted
confidence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
approve
of
my
going
away
for
years
,
then
,
and
never
coming
here
*NL*
again
till
I
have
made
myself
of
some
mark
in
the
world
?
''
said
Will
,
*NL*
trying
hard
to
reconcile
the
utmost
pride
with
the
utmost
effort
to
get
*NL*
an
expression
of
strong
feeling
from
Dorothea
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
not
aware
how
long
it
was
before
she
answered
.
She
had
turned
*NL*
her
head
and
was
looking
out
of
the
window
on
the
rose-bushes
,
which
*NL*
seemed
to
have
in
them
the
summers
of
all
the
years
when
Will
would
be
*NL*
away
.
This
was
not
judicious
behavior
.
But
Dorothea
never
thought
of
*NL*
studying
her
manners
:
she
thought
only
of
bowing
to
a
sad
necessity
*NL*
which
divided
her
from
Will
.
Those
first
words
of
his
about
his
*NL*
intentions
had
seemed
to
make
everything
clear
to
her
:
he
knew
,
she
*NL*
supposed
,
all
about
Mr.
Casaubon
's
final
conduct
in
relation
to
him
,
*NL*
and
it
had
come
to
him
with
the
same
sort
of
shock
as
to
herself
.
He
*NL*
had
never
felt
more
than
friendship
for
her
--
had
never
had
anything
in
*NL*
his
mind
to
justify
what
she
felt
to
be
her
husband
's
outrage
on
the
*NL*
feelings
of
both
:
and
that
friendship
he
still
felt
.
Something
which
*NL*
may
be
called
an
inward
silent
sob
had
gone
on
in
Dorothea
before
she
*NL*
said
with
a
pure
voice
,
just
trembling
in
the
last
words
as
if
only
*NL*
from
its
liquid
flexibility
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
must
be
right
for
you
to
do
as
you
say
.
I
shall
be
very
happy
*NL*
when
I
hear
that
you
have
made
your
value
felt
.
But
you
must
have
*NL*
patience
.
It
will
perhaps
be
a
long
while
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Will
never
quite
knew
how
it
was
that
he
saved
himself
from
falling
*NL*
down
at
her
feet
,
when
the
``
long
while
''
came
forth
with
its
gentle
*NL*
tremor
.
He
used
to
say
that
the
horrible
hue
and
surface
of
her
crape
*NL*
dress
was
most
likely
the
sufficient
controlling
force
.
He
sat
still
,
*NL*
however
,
and
only
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
never
hear
from
you
.
And
you
will
forget
all
about
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
``
I
shall
never
forget
you
.
I
have
never
forgotten
*NL*
any
one
whom
I
once
knew
.
My
life
has
never
been
crowded
,
and
seems
*NL*
not
likely
to
be
so
.
And
I
have
a
great
deal
of
space
for
memory
at
*NL*
Lowick
,
have
n't
I
?
''
She
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
God
!
''
Will
burst
out
passionately
,
rising
,
with
his
hat
still
in
*NL*
his
hand
,
and
walking
away
to
a
marble
table
,
where
he
suddenly
turned
*NL*
and
leaned
his
back
against
it
.
The
blood
had
mounted
to
his
face
and
*NL*
neck
,
and
he
looked
almost
angry
.
It
had
seemed
to
him
as
if
they
were
*NL*
like
two
creatures
slowly
turning
to
marble
in
each
other
's
presence
,
*NL*
while
their
hearts
were
conscious
and
their
eyes
were
yearning
.
But
*NL*
there
was
no
help
for
it
.
It
should
never
be
true
of
him
that
in
this
*NL*
meeting
to
which
he
had
come
with
bitter
resolution
he
had
ended
by
a
*NL*
confession
which
might
be
interpreted
into
asking
for
her
fortune
.
*NL*
Moreover
,
it
was
actually
true
that
he
was
fearful
of
the
effect
which
*NL*
such
confessions
might
have
on
Dorothea
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
at
him
from
that
distance
in
some
trouble
,
imagining
that
*NL*
there
might
have
been
an
offence
in
her
words
.
But
all
the
while
there
*NL*
was
a
current
of
thought
in
her
about
his
probable
want
of
money
,
and
*NL*
the
impossibility
of
her
helping
him
.
If
her
uncle
had
been
at
home
,
*NL*
something
might
have
been
done
through
him
!
It
was
this
preoccupation
*NL*
with
the
hardship
of
Will
's
wanting
money
,
while
she
had
what
ought
to
*NL*
have
been
his
share
,
which
led
her
to
say
,
seeing
that
he
remained
*NL*
silent
and
looked
away
from
her
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wonder
whether
you
would
like
to
have
that
miniature
which
hangs
*NL*
up-stairs
--
I
mean
that
beautiful
miniature
of
your
grandmother
.
I
*NL*
think
it
is
not
right
for
me
to
keep
it
,
if
you
would
wish
to
have
it
.
*NL*
It
is
wonderfully
like
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
very
good
,
''
said
Will
,
irritably
.
``
No
;
I
do
n't
mind
about
it
.
*NL*
It
is
not
very
consoling
to
have
one
's
own
likeness
.
It
would
be
more
*NL*
consoling
if
others
wanted
to
have
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
you
would
like
to
cherish
her
memory
--
I
thought
--
''
Dorothea
*NL*
broke
off
an
instant
,
her
imagination
suddenly
warning
her
away
from
*NL*
Aunt
Julia
's
history
--
``
you
would
surely
like
to
have
the
miniature
as
a
*NL*
family
memorial
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
should
I
have
that
,
when
I
have
nothing
else
!
A
man
with
only
a
*NL*
portmanteau
for
his
stowage

keep
his
memorials
in
his

''
*NL*
*NL*
Will
spoke
at
random
:
he
was
merely
venting
his
petulance
;
it
was
a
*NL*
little
too
exasperating
to
have
his
grandmother
's
portrait
offered
him
*NL*
at
that
moment
.
But
to
Dorothea
's
feeling
his
words
had
a
peculiar
*NL*
sting
.
She
rose
and
said
with
a
touch
of
indignation
as
well
as
*NL*
hauteur
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
much
the
happier
of
us
two
,
Mr.
Ladislaw
,
to
have
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Will
was
startled
.
Whatever
the
words
might
be
,
the
tone
seemed
like
a
*NL*
dismissal
;
and
quitting
his
leaning
posture
,
he
walked
a
little
way
*NL*
towards
her
.
Their
eyes
met
,
but
with
a
strange
questioning
gravity
.
*NL*
Something
was
keeping
their
minds
aloof
,
and
each
was
left
to
*NL*
conjecture
what
was
in
the
other
.
Will
had
really
never
thought
of
*NL*
himself
as
having
a
claim
of
inheritance
on
the
property
which
was
held
*NL*
by
Dorothea
,
and
would
have
required
a
narrative
to
make
him
understand
*NL*
her
present
feeling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
felt
it
a
misfortune
to
have
nothing
till
now
,
''
he
said
.
``
But
*NL*
poverty
may
be
as
bad
as
leprosy
,
if
it
divides
us
from
what
we
most
*NL*
care
for
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
words
cut
Dorothea
to
the
heart
,
and
made
her
relent
.
She
answered
*NL*
in
a
tone
of
sad
fellowship
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sorrow
comes
in
so
many
ways
.
Two
years
ago
I
had
no
notion
of
*NL*
that
--
I
mean
of
the
unexpected
way
in
which
trouble
comes
,
and
ties
our
*NL*
hands
,
and
makes
us
silent
when
we
long
to
speak
.
I
used
to
despise
*NL*
women
a
little
for
not
shaping
their
lives
more
,
and
doing
better
*NL*
things
.
I
was
very
fond
of
doing
as
I
liked
,
but
I
have
almost
given
*NL*
it
up
,
''
she
ended
,
smiling
playfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
not
given
up
doing
as
I
like
,
but
I
can
very
seldom
do
it
,
''
*NL*
said
Will
.
He
was
standing
two
yards
from
her
with
his
mind
full
of
*NL*
contradictory
desires
and
resolves
--
desiring
some
unmistakable
proof
*NL*
that
she
loved
him
,
and
yet
dreading
the
position
into
which
such
a
*NL*
proof
might
bring
him
.
``
The
thing
one
most
longs
for
may
be
surrounded
*NL*
with
conditions
that
would
be
intolerable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
moment
Pratt
entered
and
said
,
``
Sir
James
Chettam
is
in
the
*NL*
library
,
madam
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ask
Sir
James
to
come
in
here
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
immediately
.
It
was
as
*NL*
if
the
same
electric
shock
had
passed
through
her
and
Will
.
Each
of
*NL*
them
felt
proudly
resistant
,
and
neither
looked
at
the
other
,
while
*NL*
they
awaited
Sir
James
's
entrance
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
shaking
hands
with
Dorothea
,
he
bowed
as
slightly
as
possible
to
*NL*
Ladislaw
,
who
repaid
the
slightness
exactly
,
and
then
going
towards
*NL*
Dorothea
,
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
say
good-by
,
Mrs.
Casaubon
;
and
probably
for
a
long
while
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
put
out
her
hand
and
said
her
good-by
cordially
.
The
sense
*NL*
that
Sir
James
was
depreciating
Will
,
and
behaving
rudely
to
him
,
*NL*
roused
her
resolution
and
dignity
:
there
was
no
touch
of
confusion
in
*NL*
her
manner
.
And
when
Will
had
left
the
room
,
she
looked
with
such
calm
*NL*
self-possession
at
Sir
James
,
saying
,
``
How
is
Celia
?
''
that
he
was
*NL*
obliged
to
behave
as
if
nothing
had
annoyed
him
.
And
what
would
be
the
*NL*
use
of
behaving
otherwise
?
Indeed
,
Sir
James
shrank
with
so
much
*NL*
dislike
from
the
association
even
in
thought
of
Dorothea
with
Ladislaw
*NL*
as
her
possible
lover
,
that
he
would
himself
have
wished
to
avoid
an
*NL*
outward
show
of
displeasure
which
would
have
recognized
the
*NL*
disagreeable
possibility
.
If
any
one
had
asked
him
why
he
shrank
in
*NL*
that
way
,
I
am
not
sure
that
he
would
at
first
have
said
anything
*NL*
fuller
or
more
precise
than
''
_
That
_
Ladislaw
!
''
--
though
on
reflection
*NL*
he
might
have
urged
that
Mr.
Casaubon
's
codicil
,
barring
Dorothea
's
*NL*
marriage
with
Will
,
except
under
a
penalty
,
was
enough
to
cast
*NL*
unfitness
over
any
relation
at
all
between
them
.
His
aversion
was
all
*NL*
the
stronger
because
he
felt
himself
unable
to
interfere
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Sir
James
was
a
power
in
a
way
unguessed
by
himself
.
Entering
at
*NL*
that
moment
,
he
was
an
incorporation
of
the
strongest
reasons
through
*NL*
which
Will
's
pride
became
a
repellent
force
,
keeping
him
asunder
from
*NL*
Dorothea
.

CHAPTER
LV
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hath
she
her
faults
?
I
would
you
had
them
too
.
*NL*
They
are
the
fruity
must
of
soundest
wine
;
*NL*
Or
say
,
they
are
regenerating
fire
*NL*
Such
as
hath
turned
the
dense
black
element
*NL*
Into
a
crystal
pathway
for
the
sun
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
If
youth
is
the
season
of
hope
,
it
is
often
so
only
in
the
sense
that
*NL*
our
elders
are
hopeful
about
us
;
for
no
age
is
so
apt
as
youth
to
think
*NL*
its
emotions
,
partings
,
and
resolves
are
the
last
of
their
kind
.
Each
*NL*
crisis
seems
final
,
simply
because
it
is
new
.
We
are
told
that
the
*NL*
oldest
inhabitants
in
Peru
do
not
cease
to
be
agitated
by
the
*NL*
earthquakes
,
but
they
probably
see
beyond
each
shock
,
and
reflect
that
*NL*
there
are
plenty
more
to
come
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
Dorothea
,
still
in
that
time
of
youth
when
the
eyes
with
their
long
*NL*
full
lashes
look
out
after
their
rain
of
tears
unsoiled
and
unwearied
*NL*
as
a
freshly
opened
passion-flower
,
that
morning
's
parting
with
Will
*NL*
Ladislaw
seemed
to
be
the
close
of
their
personal
relations
.
He
was
*NL*
going
away
into
the
distance
of
unknown
years
,
and
if
ever
he
came
back
*NL*
he
would
be
another
man
.
The
actual
state
of
his
mind
--
his
proud
*NL*
resolve
to
give
the
lie
beforehand
to
any
suspicion
that
he
would
play
*NL*
the
needy
adventurer
seeking
a
rich
woman
--
lay
quite
out
of
her
*NL*
imagination
,
and
she
had
interpreted
all
his
behavior
easily
enough
by
*NL*
her
supposition
that
Mr.
Casaubon
's
codicil
seemed
to
him
,
as
it
did
to
*NL*
her
,
a
gross
and
cruel
interdict
on
any
active
friendship
between
them
.
*NL*
Their
young
delight
in
speaking
to
each
other
,
and
saying
what
no
one
*NL*
else
would
care
to
hear
,
was
forever
ended
,
and
become
a
treasure
of
*NL*
the
past
.
For
this
very
reason
she
dwelt
on
it
without
inward
check
.
*NL*
That
unique
happiness
too
was
dead
,
and
in
its
shadowed
silent
chamber
*NL*
she
might
vent
the
passionate
grief
which
she
herself
wondered
at
.
For
*NL*
the
first
time
she
took
down
the
miniature
from
the
wall
and
kept
it
*NL*
before
her
,
liking
to
blend
the
woman
who
had
been
too
hardly
judged
*NL*
with
the
grandson
whom
her
own
heart
and
judgment
defended
.
Can
any
*NL*
one
who
has
rejoiced
in
woman
's
tenderness
think
it
a
reproach
to
her
*NL*
that
she
took
the
little
oval
picture
in
her
palm
and
made
a
bed
for
it
*NL*
there
,
and
leaned
her
cheek
upon
it
,
as
if
that
would
soothe
the
*NL*
creatures
who
had
suffered
unjust
condemnation
?
She
did
not
know
then
*NL*
that
it
was
Love
who
had
come
to
her
briefly
,
as
in
a
dream
before
*NL*
awaking
,
with
the
hues
of
morning
on
his
wings
--
that
it
was
Love
to
*NL*
whom
she
was
sobbing
her
farewell
as
his
image
was
banished
by
the
*NL*
blameless
rigor
of
irresistible
day
.
She
only
felt
that
there
was
*NL*
something
irrevocably
amiss
and
lost
in
her
lot
,
and
her
thoughts
about
*NL*
the
future
were
the
more
readily
shapen
into
resolve
.
Ardent
souls
,
*NL*
ready
to
construct
their
coming
lives
,
are
apt
to
commit
themselves
to
*NL*
the
fulfilment
of
their
own
visions
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
that
she
went
to
Freshitt
to
fulfil
her
promise
of
staying
all
*NL*
night
and
seeing
baby
washed
,
Mrs.
Cadwallader
came
to
dine
,
the
Rector
*NL*
being
gone
on
a
fishing
excursion
.
It
was
a
warm
evening
,
and
even
in
*NL*
the
delightful
drawing-room
,
where
the
fine
old
turf
sloped
from
the
*NL*
open
window
towards
a
lilied
pool
and
well-planted
mounds
,
the
heat
was
*NL*
enough
to
make
Celia
in
her
white
muslin
and
light
curls
reflect
with
*NL*
pity
on
what
Dodo
must
feel
in
her
black
dress
and
close
cap
.
But
this
*NL*
was
not
until
some
episodes
with
baby
were
over
,
and
had
left
her
mind
*NL*
at
leisure
.
She
had
seated
herself
and
taken
up
a
fan
for
some
time
*NL*
before
she
said
,
in
her
quiet
guttural
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
Dodo
,
do
throw
off
that
cap
.
I
am
sure
your
dress
must
make
you
*NL*
feel
ill
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
so
used
to
the
cap
--
it
has
become
a
sort
of
shell
,
''
said
*NL*
Dorothea
,
smiling
.
``
I
feel
rather
bare
and
exposed
when
it
is
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
see
you
without
it
;
it
makes
us
all
warm
,
''
said
Celia
,
throwing
*NL*
down
her
fan
,
and
going
to
Dorothea
.
It
was
a
pretty
picture
to
see
*NL*
this
little
lady
in
white
muslin
unfastening
the
widow
's
cap
from
her
*NL*
more
majestic
sister
,
and
tossing
it
on
to
a
chair
.
Just
as
the
coils
*NL*
and
braids
of
dark-brown
hair
had
been
set
free
,
Sir
James
entered
the
*NL*
room
.
He
looked
at
the
released
head
,
and
said
,
``
Ah
!
''
in
a
tone
of
*NL*
satisfaction
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
I
who
did
it
,
James
,
''
said
Celia
.
``
Dodo
need
not
make
such
a
*NL*
slavery
of
her
mourning
;
she
need
not
wear
that
cap
any
more
among
her
*NL*
friends
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Celia
,
''
said
Lady
Chettam
,
``
a
widow
must
wear
her
mourning
at
*NL*
least
a
year
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
if
she
marries
again
before
the
end
of
it
,
''
said
Mrs.
Cadwallader
,
*NL*
who
had
some
pleasure
in
startling
her
good
friend
the
Dowager
.
Sir
*NL*
James
was
annoyed
,
and
leaned
forward
to
play
with
Celia
's
Maltese
dog
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
very
rare
,
I
hope
,
''
said
Lady
Chettam
,
in
a
tone
intended
to
*NL*
guard
against
such
events
.
``
No
friend
of
ours
ever
committed
herself
*NL*
in
that
way
except
Mrs.
Beevor
,
and
it
was
very
painful
to
Lord
*NL*
Grinsell
when
she
did
so
.
Her
first
husband
was
objectionable
,
which
*NL*
made
it
the
greater
wonder
.
And
severely
she
was
punished
for
it
.
*NL*
They
said
Captain
Beevor
dragged
her
about
by
the
hair
,
and
held
up
*NL*
loaded
pistols
at
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
if
she
took
the
wrong
man
!
''
said
Mrs.
Cadwallader
,
who
was
in
a
*NL*
decidedly
wicked
mood
.
``
Marriage
is
always
bad
then
,
first
or
second
.
*NL*
Priority
is
a
poor
recommendation
in
a
husband
if
he
has
got
no
other
.
*NL*
I
would
rather
have
a
good
second
husband
than
an
indifferent
first
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
,
your
clever
tongue
runs
away
with
you
,
''
said
Lady
Chettam
.
*NL*
``
I
am
sure
you
would
be
the
last
woman
to
marry
again
prematurely
,
if
*NL*
our
dear
Rector
were
taken
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
make
no
vows
;
it
might
be
a
necessary
economy

It
is
lawful
to
*NL*
marry
again
,
I
suppose
;
else
we
might
as
well
be
Hindoos
instead
of
*NL*
Christians
.
Of
course
if
a
woman
accepts
the
wrong
man
,
she
must
take
*NL*
the
consequences
,
and
one
who
does
it
twice
over
deserves
her
fate

*NL*
But
if
she
can
marry
blood
,
beauty

and
bravery

the
sooner
the
*NL*
better

*NL*
``
I
think
the
subject
of

conversation

very
ill-chosen

James

with
a
look

disgust

``
Suppose

change
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
Not

determined
not

the
opportunity
of
freeing
herself
from
certain
oblique
references
to

excellent
matches

``
If

are
speaking
on

I
can
assure
you
*NL*
that
no

be
more
indifferent

impersonal
to

second

fox-hunting

for
my
part
,
object
to
the
discussion
of
Human
Nature
,
*NL*
because
that
is
the
nature
of
rectors
'
wives
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Later
in
the
evening
,
after
Mrs.
Cadwallader
was
gone
,
Celia
said
*NL*
privately
to
Dorothea
,
``
Really
,
Dodo
,
taking
your
cap
off
made
you
like
*NL*
yourself
again
in
more
ways
than
one
.
You
spoke
up
just
as
you
used
to
*NL*
do
,
when
anything
was
said
to
displease
you
.
But
I
could
hardly
make
*NL*
out
whether
it
was
James
that
you
thought
wrong
,
or
Mrs.
Cadwallader
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Neither
,
''
said
Dorothea
.
``
James
spoke
out
of
delicacy
to
me
,
but
he
*NL*
was
mistaken
in
supposing
that
I
minded
what
Mrs.
Cadwallader
said
.
I
*NL*
should
only
mind
if
there
were
a
law
obliging
me
to
take
any
piece
of
*NL*
blood
and
beauty
that
she
or
anybody
else
recommended
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
know
,
Dodo
,
if
you
ever
did
marry
,
it
would
be
all
the
better
*NL*
to
have
blood
and
beauty
,
''
said
Celia
,
reflecting
that
Mr.
Casaubon
had
*NL*
not
been
richly
endowed
with
those
gifts
,
and
that
it
would
be
well
to
*NL*
caution
Dorothea
in
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
be
anxious
,
Kitty
;
I
have
quite
other
thoughts
about
my
life
.
I
*NL*
shall
never
marry
again
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
touching
her
sister
's
chin
,
*NL*
and
looking
at
her
with
indulgent
affection
.
Celia
was
nursing
her
*NL*
baby
,
and
Dorothea
had
come
to
say
good-night
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
--
quite
?
''
said
Celia
.
``
Not
anybody
at
all
--
if
he
were
very
*NL*
wonderful
indeed
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
shook
her
head
slowly
.
``
Not
anybody
at
all
.
I
have
*NL*
delightful
plans
.
I
should
like
to
take
a
great
deal
of
land
,
and
*NL*
drain
it
,
and
make
a
little
colony
,
where
everybody
should
work
,
and
*NL*
all
the
work
should
be
done
well
.
I
should
know
every
one
of
the
*NL*
people
and
be
their
friend
.
I
am
going
to
have
great
consultations
*NL*
with
Mr.
Garth
:
he
can
tell
me
almost
everything
I
want
to
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
_
will
_
be
happy
,
if
you
have
a
plan
,
Dodo
?
''
said
Celia
.
*NL*
``
Perhaps
little
Arthur
will
like
plans
when
he
grows
up
,
and
then
he
*NL*
can
help
you

''
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
James
was
informed
that
same
night
that
Dorothea
was
really
quite
*NL*
set
against
marrying
anybody
at
all
,
and
was
going
to
take
to
``
all
*NL*
sorts
of
plans
,
''
just
like
what
she
used
to
have
.
Sir
James
made
no
*NL*
remark
.
To
his
secret
feeling
there
was
something
repulsive
in
a
*NL*
woman
's
second
marriage
,
and
no
match
would
prevent
him
from
feeling
it
*NL*
a
sort
of
desecration
for
Dorothea
.
He
was
aware
that
the
world
would
*NL*
regard
such
a
sentiment
as
preposterous
,
especially
in
relation
to
a
*NL*
woman
of
one-and-twenty
;
the
practice
of
``
the
world
''
being
to
treat
of
*NL*
a
young
widow
's
second
marriage
as
certain
and
probably
near
,
and
to
*NL*
smile
with
meaning
if
the
widow
acts
accordingly
.
But
if
Dorothea
did
*NL*
choose
to
espouse
her
solitude
,
he
felt
that
the
resolution
would
well
*NL*
become
her
.

SIR
HENRY
WOTTON
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
's
confidence
in
Caleb
Garth
's
knowledge
,
which
had
begun
on
*NL*
her
hearing
that
he
approved
of
her
cottages
,
had
grown
fast
during
her
*NL*
stay
at
Freshitt
,
Sir
James
having
induced
her
to
take
rides
over
the
*NL*
two
estates
in
company
with
himself
and
Caleb
,
who
quite
returned
her
*NL*
admiration
,
and
told
his
wife
that
Mrs.
Casaubon
had
a
head
for
*NL*
business
most
uncommon
in
a
woman
.
It
must
be
remembered
that
by
*NL*
``
business
''
Caleb
never
meant
money
transactions
,
but
the
skilful
*NL*
application
of
labor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Most
uncommon
!
''
repeated
Caleb
.
``
She
said
a
thing
I
often
used
to
*NL*
think
myself
when
I
was
a
lad
:
--
`
Mr.
Garth
,
I
should
like
to
feel
,
if
I
*NL*
lived
to
be
old
,
that
I
had
improved
a
great
piece
of
land
and
built
a
*NL*
great
many
good
cottages
,
because
the
work
is
of
a
healthy
kind
while
*NL*
it
is
being
done
,
and
after
it
is
done
,
men
are
the
better
for
it
.
'
*NL*
Those
were
the
very
words
:
she
sees
into
things
in
that
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
womanly
,
I
hope
,
''
said
Mrs.
Garth
,
half
suspecting
that
Mrs.
*NL*
Casaubon
might
not
hold
the
true
principle
of
subordination
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
ca
n't
think
!
''
said
Caleb
,
shaking
his
head
.
``
You
would
like
*NL*
to
hear
her
speak
,
Susan
.
She
speaks
in
such
plain
words
,
and
a
voice
*NL*
like
music
.
Bless
me
!
it
reminds
me
of
bits
in
the
`
Messiah
'
--
`
and
*NL*
straightway
there
appeared
a
multitude
of
the
heavenly
host
,
praising
*NL*
God
and
saying
;
'
it
has
a
tone
with
it
that
satisfies
your
ear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Caleb
was
very
fond
of
music
,
and
when
he
could
afford
it
went
to
hear
*NL*
an
oratorio
that
came
within
his
reach
,
returning
from
it
with
a
*NL*
profound
reverence
for
this
mighty
structure
of
tones
,
which
made
him
*NL*
sit
meditatively
,
looking
on
the
floor
and
throwing
much
unutterable
*NL*
language
into
his
outstretched
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
this
good
understanding
between
them
,
it
was
natural
that
Dorothea
*NL*
asked
Mr.
Garth
to
undertake
any
business
connected
with
the
three
*NL*
farms
and
the
numerous
tenements
attached
to
Lowick
Manor
;
indeed
,
his
*NL*
expectation
of
getting
work
for
two
was
being
fast
fulfilled
.
As
he
*NL*
said
,
``
Business
breeds
.
''
And
one
form
of
business
which
was
beginning
*NL*
to
breed
just
then
was
the
construction
of
railways
.
A
projected
line
*NL*
was
to
run
through
Lowick
parish
where
the
cattle
had
hitherto
grazed
*NL*
in
a
peace
unbroken
by
astonishment
;
and
thus
it
happened
that
the
*NL*
infant
struggles
of
the
railway
system
entered
into
the
affairs
of
*NL*
Caleb
Garth
,
and
determined
the
course
of
this
history
with
regard
to
*NL*
two
persons
who
were
dear
to
him
.
The
submarine
railway
may
have
its
*NL*
difficulties
;
but
the
bed
of
the
sea
is
not
divided
among
various
*NL*
landed
proprietors
with
claims
for
damages
not
only
measurable
but
*NL*
sentimental
.
In
the
hundred
to
which
Middlemarch
belonged
railways
*NL*
were
as
exciting
a
topic
as
the
Reform
Bill
or
the
imminent
horrors
of
*NL*
Cholera
,
and
those
who
held
the
most
decided
views
on
the
subject
were
*NL*
women
and
landholders
.
Women
both
old
and
young
regarded
travelling
by
*NL*
steam
as
presumptuous
and
dangerous
,
and
argued
against
it
by
saying
*NL*
that
nothing
should
induce
them
to
get
into
a
railway
carriage
;
while
*NL*
proprietors
,
differing
from
each
other
in
their
arguments
as
much
as
*NL*
Mr.
Solomon
Featherstone
differed
from
Lord
Medlicote
,
were
yet
*NL*
unanimous
in
the
opinion
that
in
selling
land
,
whether
to
the
Enemy
of
*NL*
mankind
or
to
a
company
obliged
to
purchase
,
these
pernicious
agencies
*NL*
must
be
made
to
pay
a
very
high
price
to
landowners
for
permission
to
*NL*
injure
mankind
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
slower
wits
,
such
as
Mr.
Solomon
and
Mrs.
Waule
,
who
both
*NL*
occupied
land
of
their
own
,
took
a
long
time
to
arrive
at
this
*NL*
conclusion
,
their
minds
halting
at
the
vivid
conception
of
what
it
*NL*
would
be
to
cut
the
Big
Pasture
in
two
,
and
turn
it
into
three-cornered
*NL*
bits
,
which
would
be
``
nohow
;
''
while
accommodation-bridges
and
high
*NL*
payments
were
remote
and
incredible
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
cows
will
all
cast
their
calves
,
brother
,
''
said
Mrs.
Waule
,
in
a
*NL*
tone
of
deep
melancholy
,
``
if
the
railway
comes
across
the
Near
Close
;
*NL*
and
I
should
n't
wonder
at
the
mare
too
,
if
she
was
in
foal
.
It
's
a
*NL*
poor
tale
if
a
widow
's
property
is
to
be
spaded
away
,
and
the
law
say
*NL*
nothing
to
it
.
What
's
to
hinder
'em
from
cutting
right
and
left
if
*NL*
they
begin
?
It
's
well
known
,
_
I
_
ca
n't
fight
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
best
way
would
be
to
say
nothing
,
and
set
somebody
on
to
send
'em
*NL*
away
with
a
flea
in
their
ear
,
when
they
came
spying
and
measuring
,
''
*NL*
said
Solomon
.
``
Folks
did
that
about
Brassing
,
by
what
I
can
*NL*
understand
.
It
's
all
a
pretence
,
if
the
truth
was
known
,
about
their
*NL*
being
forced
to
take
one
way
.
Let
'em
go
cutting
in
another
parish
.
*NL*
And
I
do
n't
believe
in
any
pay
to
make
amends
for
bringing
a
lot
of
*NL*
ruffians
to
trample
your
crops
.
Where
's
a
company
's
pocket
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Brother
Peter
,
God
forgive
him
,
got
money
out
of
a
company
,
''
said
Mrs.
*NL*
Waule
.
``
But
that
was
for
the
manganese
.
That
was
n't
for
railways
to
*NL*
blow
you
to
pieces
right
and
left
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
there
's
this
to
be
said
,
Jane
,
''
Mr.
Solomon
concluded
,
lowering
*NL*
his
voice
in
a
cautious
manner
--
``
the
more
spokes
we
put
in
their
wheel
,
*NL*
the
more
they
'll
pay
us
to
let
'em
go
on
,
if
they
must
come
whether
or
*NL*
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
reasoning
of
Mr.
Solomon
's
was
perhaps
less
thorough
than
he
*NL*
imagined
,
his
cunning
bearing
about
the
same
relation
to
the
course
of
*NL*
railways
as
the
cunning
of
a
diplomatist
bears
to
the
general
chill
or
*NL*
catarrh
of
the
solar
system
.
But
he
set
about
acting
on
his
views
in
a
*NL*
thoroughly
diplomatic
manner
,
by
stimulating
suspicion
.
His
side
of
*NL*
Lowick
was
the
most
remote
from
the
village
,
and
the
houses
of
the
*NL*
laboring
people
were
either
lone
cottages
or
were
collected
in
a
hamlet
*NL*
called
Frick
,
where
a
water-mill
and
some
stone-pits
made
a
little
*NL*
centre
of
slow
,
heavy-shouldered
industry
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
absence
of
any
precise
idea
as
to
what
railways
were
,
public
*NL*
opinion
in
Frick
was
against
them
;
for
the
human
mind
in
that
grassy
*NL*
corner
had
not
the
proverbial
tendency
to
admire
the
unknown
,
holding
*NL*
rather
that
it
was
likely
to
be
against
the
poor
man
,
and
that
*NL*
suspicion
was
the
only
wise
attitude
with
regard
to
it
.
Even
the
rumor
*NL*
of
Reform
had
not
yet
excited
any
millennial
expectations
in
Frick
,
*NL*
there
being
no
definite
promise
in
it
,
as
of
gratuitous
grains
to
*NL*
fatten
Hiram
Ford
's
pig
,
or
of
a
publican
at
the
``
Weights
and
Scales
''
*NL*
who
would
brew
beer
for
nothing
,
or
of
an
offer
on
the
part
of
the
*NL*
three
neighboring
farmers
to
raise
wages
during
winter
.
And
without
*NL*
distinct
good
of
this
kind
in
its
promises
,
Reform
seemed
on
a
footing
*NL*
with
the
bragging
of
pedlers
,
which
was
a
hint
for
distrust
to
every
*NL*
knowing
person
.
The
men
of
Frick
were
not
ill-fed
,
and
were
less
given
*NL*
to
fanaticism
than
to
a
strong
muscular
suspicion
;
less
inclined
to
*NL*
believe
that
they
were
peculiarly
cared
for
by
heaven
,
than
to
regard
*NL*
heaven
itself
as
rather
disposed
to
take
them
in
--
a
disposition
*NL*
observable
in
the
weather
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
the
mind
of
Frick
was
exactly
of
the
sort
for
Mr.
Solomon
*NL*
Featherstone
to
work
upon
,
he
having
more
plenteous
ideas
of
the
same
*NL*
order
,
with
a
suspicion
of
heaven
and
earth
which
was
better
fed
and
*NL*
more
entirely
at
leisure
.
Solomon
was
overseer
of
the
roads
at
that
*NL*
time
,
and
on
his
slow-paced
cob
often
took
his
rounds
by
Frick
to
look
*NL*
at
the
workmen
getting
the
stones
there
,
pausing
with
a
mysterious
*NL*
deliberation
,
which
might
have
misled
you
into
supposing
that
he
had
*NL*
some
other
reason
for
staying
than
the
mere
want
of
impulse
to
move
.
*NL*
After
looking
for
a
long
while
at
any
work
that
was
going
on
,
he
would
*NL*
raise
his
eyes
a
little
and
look
at
the
horizon
;
finally
he
would
shake
*NL*
his
bridle
,
touch
his
horse
with
the
whip
,
and
get
it
to
move
slowly
*NL*
onward
.
The
hour-hand
of
a
clock
was
quick
by
comparison
with
Mr.
*NL*
Solomon
,
who
had
an
agreeable
sense
that
he
could
afford
to
be
slow
.
*NL*
He
was
in
the
habit
of
pausing
for
a
cautious
,
vaguely
designing
chat
*NL*
with
every
hedger
or
ditcher
on
his
way
,
and
was
especially
willing
to
*NL*
listen
even
to
news
which
he
had
heard
before
,
feeling
himself
at
an
*NL*
advantage
over
all
narrators
in
partially
disbelieving
them
.
One
day
,
*NL*
however
,
he
got
into
a
dialogue
with
Hiram
Ford
,
a
wagoner
,
in
which
he
*NL*
himself
contributed
information
.
He
wished
to
know
whether
Hiram
had
*NL*
seen
fellows
with
staves
and
instruments
spying
about
:
they
called
*NL*
themselves
railroad
people
,
but
there
was
no
telling
what
they
were
or
*NL*
what
they
meant
to
do
.
The
least
they
pretended
was
that
they
were
*NL*
going
to
cut
Lowick

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

they

said
Hiram
,
who
had
a
dim
notion
*NL*
of
London
as
a
centre
of
hostility
to
the
country
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay

to
be
sure

And
in
some
parts
against

I
've

the
folks
fell
on
'em
when
they
were
spying

and
broke
their
*NL*
peep-holes
as
they
carry

and
drove
'em
away

*NL*
``

Hiram
,
whose
fun
was
much
*NL*
restricted
by
circumstances
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
would
n't
meddle
with

said
Solomon
.
``
But
some

*NL*
this

seen

the

being
*NL*
overrun
with
these
fellows
trampling
right
and
left
,
and
wanting
to
cut
*NL*
it
up
into
railways
;
and
all
for
the
big
traffic

swallow
up
the
*NL*
little

The
ruin
of
this
countryside
by
*NL*
railroads
was
discussed
,
not
only
at
the
``
Weights
and
Scales
,
''
but
in
*NL*
the
hay-field
,
where
the
muster
of
working
hands
gave
opportunities
for
*NL*
talk
such
as
were
rarely
had
through
the
rural
year
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
morning
,
not
long
after
that
interview
between
Mr.
Farebrother
and
*NL*
Mary
Garth
,
in
which
she
confessed
to
him
her
feeling
for
Fred
Vincy
,
*NL*
it
happened
that
her
father
had
some
business
which
took
him
to
*NL*
Yoddrell
's
farm
in
the
direction
of
Frick
:
it
was
to
measure
and
value
*NL*
an
outlying
piece
of
land
belonging
to
Lowick
Manor
,
which
Caleb
*NL*
expected
to
dispose
of
advantageously
for
Dorothea
-LRB-
it
must
be
*NL*
confessed
that
his
bias
was
towards
getting
the
best
possible
terms
*NL*
from
railroad
companies
-RRB-
.
He
put
up
his
gig
at
Yoddrell
's
,
and
in
*NL*
walking
with
his
assistant
and
measuring-chain
to
the
scene
of
his
*NL*
work
,
he
encountered
the
party
of
the
company
's
agents
,
who
were
*NL*
adjusting
their
spirit-level
.
After
a
little
chat
he
left
them
,
*NL*
observing
that
by-and-by
they
would
reach
him
again
where
he
was
going
*NL*
to
measure
.
It
was
one
of
those
gray
mornings
after
light
rains
,
which
*NL*
become
delicious
about
twelve
o'clock
,
when
the
clouds
part
a
little
,
*NL*
and
the
scent
of
the
earth
is
sweet
along
the
lanes
and
by
the
*NL*
hedgerows
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
scent
would
have
been
sweeter
to
Fred
Vincy
,
who
was
coming
along
*NL*
the
lanes
on
horseback
,
if
his
mind
had
not
been
worried
by
*NL*
unsuccessful
efforts
to
imagine
what
he
was
to
do
,
with
his
father
on
*NL*
one
side
expecting
him
straightway
to
enter
the
Church
,
with
Mary
on
*NL*
the
other
threatening
to
forsake
him
if
he
did
enter
it
,
and
with
the
*NL*
working-day
world
showing
no
eager
need
whatever
of
a
young
gentleman
*NL*
without
capital
and
generally
unskilled
.
It
was
the
harder
to
Fred
's
*NL*
disposition
because
his
father
,
satisfied
that
he
was
no
longer
*NL*
rebellious
,
was
in
good
humor
with
him
,
and
had
sent
him
on
this
*NL*
pleasant
ride
to
see
after
some
greyhounds
.
Even
when
he
had
fixed
on
*NL*
what
he
should
do
,
there
would
be
the
task
of
telling
his
father
.
But
*NL*
it
must
be
admitted
that
the
fixing
,
which
had
to
come
first
,
was
the
*NL*
more
difficult
task
:
--
what
secular
avocation
on
earth
was
there
for
a
*NL*
young
man
-LRB-
whose
friends
could
not
get
him
an
``
appointment
''
-RRB-
which
was
*NL*
at
once
gentlemanly
,
lucrative
,
and
to
be
followed
without
special
*NL*
knowledge
?
Riding
along
the
lanes
by
Frick
in
this
mood
,
and
*NL*
slackening
his
pace
while
he
reflected
whether
he
should
venture
to
go
*NL*
round
by
Lowick
Parsonage
to
call
on
Mary
,
he
could
see
over
the
hedges
*NL*
from
one
field
to
another
.
Suddenly
a
noise
roused
his
attention
,
and
*NL*
on
the
far
side
of
a
field
on
his
left
hand
he
could
see
six
or
seven
*NL*
men
in
smock-frocks
with
hay-forks
in
their
hands
making
an
offensive
*NL*
approach
towards
the
four
railway
agents
who
were
facing
them
,
while
*NL*
Caleb
Garth
and
his
assistant
were
hastening
across
the
field
to
join
*NL*
the
threatened
group
.
Fred
,
delayed
a
few
moments
by
having
to
find
*NL*
the
gate
,
could
not
gallop
up
to
the
spot
before
the
party
in
*NL*
smock-frocks
,
whose
work
of
turning
the
hay
had
not
been
too
pressing
*NL*
after
swallowing
their
mid-day
beer
,
were
driving
the
men
in
coats
*NL*
before
them
with
their
hay-forks
;
while
Caleb
Garth
's
assistant
,
a
lad
*NL*
of
seventeen
,
who
had
snatched
up
the
spirit-level
at
Caleb
's
order
,
*NL*
had
been
knocked
down
and
seemed
to
be
lying
helpless
.
The
coated
men
*NL*
had
the
advantage
as
runners
,
and
Fred
covered
their
retreat
by
getting
*NL*
in
front
of
the
smock-frocks
and
charging
them
suddenly
enough
to
throw
*NL*
their
chase
into
confusion
.
``
What
do
you
confounded
fools
mean
?
''
*NL*
shouted
Fred
,
pursuing
the
divided
group
in
a
zigzag
,
and
cutting
right
*NL*
and
left
with
his
whip
.
``
I
'll
swear
to
every
one
of
you
before
the
*NL*
magistrate
.
You
've
knocked
the
lad
down
and
killed
him
,
for
what
I
*NL*
know
.
You
'll
every
one
of
you
be
hanged
at
the
next
assizes
,
if
you
*NL*
do
n't
mind
,
''
said
Fred
,
who
afterwards
laughed
heartily
as
he
*NL*
remembered
his
own
phrases
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
laborers
had
been
driven
through
the
gate-way
into
their
hay-field
,
*NL*
and
Fred
had
checked
his
horse
,
when
Hiram
Ford
,
observing
himself
at
a
*NL*
safe
challenging
distance
,
turned
back
and
shouted
a
defiance
which
he
*NL*
did
not
know
to
be
Homeric
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yo
're
a
coward
,
yo
are
.
Yo
git
off
your
horse
,
young
measter
,
and
*NL*
I
'll
have
a
round
wi

ye

I
wull
.
Yo
dared
n't
come
on
wi'out
your
hoss

I
'd
soon
knock
the
breath
out
on
ye
,
I
would
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait
a
minute
,
and
I
'll
come
back
presently
,
and
have
a
round
with
you
*NL*
all
in
turn
,
if
you
like
,
''
said
Fred
,
who
felt
confidence
in
his
power
*NL*
of
boxing
with
his
dearly
beloved
brethren
.
But
just
now
he
wanted
to
*NL*
hasten
back
to
Caleb
and
the
prostrate
youth
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
lad
's
ankle
was
strained
,
and
he
was
in
much
pain
from
it
,
but
he
*NL*
was
no
further
hurt
,
and
Fred
placed
him
on
the
horse
that
he
might
*NL*
ride
to
Yoddrell
's
and
be
taken
care
of
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
them
put
the
horse
in
the
stable
,
and
tell
the
surveyors
they
can
*NL*
come
back
for
their
traps
,
''
said
Fred
.
``
The
ground
is
clear
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
''
said
Caleb
,
``
here
's
a
breakage
.
They
'll
have
to
give
up
for
*NL*
to-day
,
and
it
will
be
as
well
.
Here
,
take
the
things
before
you
on
*NL*
the
horse
,
Tom
.
They
'll
see
you
coming
,
and
they
'll
turn
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
glad
I
happened
to
be
here
at
the
right
moment
,
Mr.
Garth
,
''
said
*NL*
Fred
,
as
Tom
rode
away
.
``
No
knowing
what
might
have
happened
if
the
*NL*
cavalry
had
not
come
up
in
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
ay
,
it
was
lucky
,
''
said
Caleb
,
speaking
rather
absently
,
and
*NL*
looking
towards
the
spot
where
he
had
been
at
work
at
the
moment
of
*NL*
interruption
.
``
But
--
deuce
take
it
--
this
is
what
comes
of
men
being
*NL*
fools

I
'm
hindered

my
day
's
work
.
I
ca
n't
get
along
without
*NL*
somebody
to
help
me
with
the
measuring-chain
.
However
!
''
He
was
*NL*
beginning
to
move
towards
the
spot
with
a
look
of
vexation
,
as
if
he
*NL*
had
forgotten
Fred
's
presence
,
but
suddenly
he
turned
round
and
said
*NL*
quickly
,
``
What
have
you
got
to
do
to-day
,
young
fellow
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
,
Mr.
Garth
.
I
'll
help
you
with
pleasure
--
can
I
?
''
said
Fred
,
*NL*
with
a
sense
that
he
should
be
courting
Mary
when
he
was
helping
her
*NL*
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
must
n't
mind
stooping
and
getting
hot
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
mind
anything

Only
I
want
to
go
first
and
have
a
round
with
*NL*
that
hulky
fellow
who
turned
to
challenge
me
.
It
would
be
a
good
*NL*
lesson
for
him
.
I
shall
not
be
five
minutes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nonsense
!
''
said
Caleb
,
with
his
most
peremptory
intonation
.
``
I
shall
*NL*
go
and
speak
to
the
men
myself
.
It
's
all
ignorance
.
Somebody
has
been
*NL*
telling
them
lies
.
The
poor
fools
do
n't
know
any
better

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
go
with
you
,
then
,
''
said
Fred
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no

stay
where
you
are

I
do
n't
want
your
young
blood

I
can
*NL*
take
care
of
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Caleb
was
a
powerful
man
and
knew
little
of
any
fear
except
the
fear
of
*NL*
hurting
others
and
the
fear
of
having
to
speechify
.
But
he
felt
it
his
*NL*
duty
at
this
moment
to
try
and
give
a
little
harangue
.
There
was
a
*NL*
striking
mixture
in
him
--
which
came
from
his
having
always
been
a
*NL*
hard-working
man
himself
--
of
rigorous
notions
about
workmen
and
*NL*
practical
indulgence
towards
them
.
To
do
a
good
day
's
work
and
to
do
*NL*
it
well
,
he
held
to
be
part
of
their
welfare
,
as
it
was
the
chief
part
*NL*
of
his
own
happiness
;
but
he
had
a
strong
sense
of
fellowship
with
*NL*
them
.
When
he
advanced
towards
the
laborers
they
had
not
gone
to
work
*NL*
again
,
but
were
standing
in
that
form
of
rural
grouping
which
consists
*NL*
in
each
turning
a
shoulder
towards
the
other
,
at
a
distance
of
two
or
*NL*
three
yards
.
They
looked
rather
sulkily
at
Caleb
,
who
walked
quickly
*NL*
with
one
hand
in
his
pocket
and
the
other
thrust
between
the
buttons
of
*NL*
his
waistcoat
,
and
had
his
every-day
mild
air
when
he
paused
among
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
my
lads
,
how
's
this
?
''
he
began
,
taking
as
usual
to
brief
phrases
,
*NL*
which
seemed
pregnant
to
himself
,
because
he
had
many
thoughts
lying
*NL*
under
them
,
like
the
abundant
roots
of
a
plant
that
just
manages
to
*NL*
peep
above
the
water
.
``
How
came
you
to
make
such
a
mistake
as
this
?
*NL*
Somebody
has
been
telling
you
lies
.
You
thought
those
men
up
there
*NL*
wanted
to
do
mischief
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aw
!
''
was
the
answer
,
dropped
at
intervals
by
each
according
to
his
*NL*
degree
of
unreadiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nonsense
!
No
such
thing
!
They
're
looking
out
to
see
which
way
the
*NL*
railroad
is
to
take
.
Now
,
my
lads
,
you
ca
n't
hinder
the
railroad
:
it
*NL*
will
be
made
whether
you
like
it
or
not
.
And
if
you
go
fighting
*NL*
against
it
,
you
'll
get
yourselves
into
trouble
.
The
law
gives
those
*NL*
men
leave
to
come
here
on
the
land
.
The
owner
has
nothing
to
say
*NL*
against
it
,
and
if
you
meddle
with
them
you
'll
have
to
do
with
the
*NL*
constable
and
Justice
Blakesley
,
and
with
the
handcuffs
and
Middlemarch
*NL*
jail
.
And
you
might
be
in
for
it
now
,
if
anybody
informed
against
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Caleb
paused
here
,
and
perhaps
the
greatest
orator
could
not
have
*NL*
chosen
either
his
pause
or
his
images
better
for
the
occasion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
come
,
you
did
n't
mean
any
harm
.
Somebody
told
you
the
railroad
*NL*
was
a
bad
thing
.
That
was
a
lie
.
It
may
do
a
bit
of
harm
here
and
*NL*
there
,
to
this
and
to
that
;
and
so
does
the
sun
in
heaven
.
But
the
*NL*
railway
's
a
good
thing

*NL*
*NL*
``
Aw
!
good
for
the
big
folks
to
make
money
out
on

said
old
Timothy
*NL*
Cooper
,
who
had
stayed
behind
turning
his
hay
while
the
others
had
been
*NL*
gone
on
their
spree
;

Timothy
was
a
wiry
old
laborer
,
of
a
type
lingering
in
those
times
--
who
*NL*
had
his
savings
in
a
stocking-foot
,
lived
in
a
lone
cottage
,
and
was
*NL*
not
to
be
wrought
on
by
any
oratory
,
having
as
little
of
the
feudal
*NL*
spirit
,
and
believing
as
little
,
as
if
he
had
not
been
totally
*NL*
unacquainted
with
the
Age
of
Reason
and
the
Rights
of
Man
.
Caleb
was
*NL*
in
a
difficulty
known
to
any
person
attempting
in
dark
times
and
*NL*
unassisted
by
miracle
to
reason
with
rustics
who
are
in
possession
of
*NL*
an
undeniable
truth
which
they
know
through
a
hard
process
of
feeling
,
*NL*
and
can
let
it
fall
like
a
giant
's
club
on
your
neatly
carved
argument
*NL*
for
a
social
benefit
which
they
do
not
feel
.
Caleb
had
no
cant
at
*NL*
command
,
even
if
he
could
have
chosen
to
use
it
;
and
he
had
been
*NL*
accustomed
to
meet
all
such
difficulties
in
no
other
way
than
by
doing
*NL*
his
``
business
''
faithfully
.
He
answered
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you

n't
think
well

Tim
,
never

that

Things

be
bad

bad
they

but
I
*NL*
want
the
lads
here
not
to
do
what
will
make
things
worse
for

themselves

The

may
have
a
heavy
load

*NL*
``

said
Hiram

who
was

consequences
.
``

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
``

Timothy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

*NL*
``
Aw

we
wooant

do

--
were
the
*NL*
forms
in
which
Caleb
got
his
pledges
;
and
then
he
hastened
back
to
*NL*
Fred
,
who
had
followed
him
,
and
watched
him
in
the
gateway
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
went
to
work
,
and
Fred
helped
vigorously
.
His
spirits
had
risen
,
*NL*
and
he
heartily
enjoyed
a
good
slip
in
the
moist
earth
under
the
*NL*
hedgerow
,
which
soiled
his
perfect
summer
trousers
.
Was
it
his
*NL*
successful
onset
which
had
elated
him
,
or
the
satisfaction
of
helping
*NL*
Mary
's
father
?
Something
more
.
The
accidents
of
the
morning
had
*NL*
helped
his
frustrated
imagination
to
shape
an
employment
for
himself
*NL*
which
had
several
attractions
.
I
am
not
sure
that
certain
fibres
in
*NL*
Mr.
Garth
's
mind
had
not
resumed
their
old
vibration
towards
the
very
*NL*
end
which
now
revealed
itself
to
Fred
.
For
the
effective
accident
is
*NL*
but
the
touch
of
fire
where
there
is
oil
and
tow
;
and
it
always
*NL*
appeared
to
Fred
that
the
railway
brought
the
needed
touch
.
But
they
*NL*
went
on
in
silence
except
when
their
business
demanded
speech
.
At
*NL*
last
,
when
they
had
finished
and
were
walking
away
,
Mr.
Garth
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
young
fellow
need
n't
be
a
B.
A.
to
do
this
sort
of
work
,
eh
,
Fred
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
I
had
taken
to
it
before
I
had
thought
of
being
a
B.
A.
,
''
said
*NL*
Fred
.
He
paused
a
moment
,
and
then
added
,
more
hesitatingly
,
``
Do
you
*NL*
think
I
am
too
old
to
learn
your
business
,
Mr.
Garth
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
business
is
of
many
sorts
,
my
boy
,
''
said
Mr.
Garth
,
smiling
.
``
A
*NL*
good
deal
of
what
I
know
can
only
come
from
experience
:
you
ca
n't
learn
*NL*
it
off
as
you
learn
things
out
of
a
book
.
But
you
are
young
enough
to
*NL*
lay
a
foundation
yet
.
''
Caleb
pronounced
the
last
sentence
*NL*
emphatically
,
but
paused
in
some
uncertainty
.
He
had
been
under
the
*NL*
impression
lately
that
Fred
had
made
up
his
mind
to
enter
the
Church
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
think
I
could
do
some
good
at
it
,
if
I
were
to
try
?
''
said
Fred
,
*NL*
more
eagerly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
depends
,
''
said
Caleb
,
turning
his
head
on
one
side
and
lowering
*NL*
his
voice
,
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
felt
himself
to
be
saying
*NL*
something
deeply
religious
.
``
You
must
be
sure
of
two
things
:
you
must
*NL*
love
your
work
,
and
not
be
always
looking
over
the
edge
of
it
,
wanting
*NL*
your
play
to
begin
.
And
the
other
is
,
you
must
not
be
ashamed
of
your
*NL*
work
,
and
think
it
would
be
more
honorable
to
you
to
be
doing
something
*NL*
else
.
You
must
have
a
pride
in
your
own
work
and
in
learning
to
do
it
*NL*
well
,
and
not
be
always
saying
,
There
's
this
and
there
's
that
--
if
I
had
*NL*
this
or
that
to
do
,
I
might
make
something
of
it
.
No
matter
what
a
man
*NL*
is
--
I
would
n't
give
twopence
for
him
''
--
here
Caleb
's
mouth
looked
*NL*
bitter
,
and
he
snapped
his
fingers
--
``
whether
he
was
the
prime
minister
*NL*
or
the
rick-thatcher
,
if
he
did
n't
do
well
what
he
undertook
to
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
never
feel
that
I
should
do
that
in
being
a
clergyman
,
''
said
*NL*
Fred
,
meaning
to
take
a
step
in
argument
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
let
it
alone
,
my
boy
,
''
said
Caleb
,
abruptly
,
``
else
you
'll
never
*NL*
be
easy
.
Or
,
if
you
_
are
_
easy
,
you
'll
be
a
poor
stick
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
very
nearly
what
Mary
thinks
about
it
,
''
said
Fred
,
coloring
.
*NL*
``
I
think
you
must
know
what
I
feel
for
Mary
,
Mr.
Garth
:
I
hope
it
does
*NL*
not
displease
you
that
I
have
always
loved
her
better
than
any
one
*NL*
else
,
and
that
I
shall
never
love
any
one
as
I
love
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
expression
of
Caleb
's
face
was
visibly
softening
while
Fred
spoke
.
*NL*
But
he
swung
his
head
with
a
solemn
slowness
,
and
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
makes
things
more
serious
,
Fred
,
if
you
want
to
take
Mary
's
*NL*
happiness
into
your
keeping
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
that
,
Mr.
Garth
,
''
said
Fred
,
eagerly
,
``
and
I
would
do
anything
*NL*
for
_
her
_
.
She
says
she
will
never
have
me
if
I
go
into
the
Church
;
*NL*
and
I
shall
be
the
most
miserable
devil
in
the
world
if
I
lose
all
hope
*NL*
of
Mary
.
Really
,
if
I
could
get
some
other
profession
,
*NL*
business
--
anything
that
I
am
at
all
fit
for
,
I
would
work
hard
,
I
would
*NL*
deserve
your
good
opinion
.
I
should
like
to
have
to
do
with
outdoor
*NL*
things
.
I
know
a
good
deal
about
land
and
cattle
already
.
I
used
to
*NL*
believe
,
you
know
--
though
you
will
think
me
rather
foolish
for
it
--
that
*NL*
I
should
have
land
of
my
own
.
I
am
sure
knowledge
of
that
sort
would
*NL*
come
easily
to
me
,
especially
if
I
could
be
under
you
in
any
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Softly
,
my
boy
,
''
said
Caleb
,
having
the
image
of
``
Susan
''
before
his
*NL*
eyes
.
``
What
have
you
said
to
your
father
about
all
this
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing

yet
;
but
I
must
tell
him
.
I
am
only
waiting
to
know
what
I
*NL*
can
do
instead
of
entering
the
Church
.
I
am
very
sorry
to
disappoint
*NL*
him
,
but
a
man
ought
to
be
allowed
to
judge
for
himself
when
he
is
*NL*
four-and-twenty
.
How
could
I
know
when
I
was
fifteen
,
what
it
would
be
*NL*
right
for
me
to
do
now
?
My
education
was
a
mistake
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
hearken
to
this
,
Fred
,
''
said
Caleb
.
``
Are
you
sure
Mary
is
fond
of
*NL*
you
,
or
would
ever
have
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
asked
Mr.
Farebrother
to
talk
to
her
,
because
she
had
forbidden
*NL*
me
--
I
did
n't
know
what
else
to
do
,

said
Fred
,
apologetically
.
``
And
he
*NL*
says
that
I
have
every
reason
to
hope
,
if
I
can
put
myself
in
an
*NL*
honorable
position
--
I
mean
,
out
of
the
Church

I
dare
say
you
think
it
*NL*
unwarrantable
in
me
,
Mr.
Garth
,
to
be
troubling
you
and
obtruding
my
*NL*

*NL*
Of

I
have
not

claim

indeed

I
have
already
a
debt
to
*NL*
you
which
will
never
be
discharged
,
even
when
I
have
been

able
to
pay

it
in
the
shape
of
money

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
my
boy
,
you
have
a
claim

''
said
Caleb
,
with
much
feeling
in
his
*NL*
voice
.
``
The
young
ones
have
always
a
claim
on
the
old
to
help
them

forward

I
was
young
myself
once
and
had
to
do
without
much
help
;
but
*NL*
help
would
have
been
welcome
to
me
,
if
it
had
been
only
for
the
*NL*
fellow-feeling
's
sake
.
But
I
must
consider
.
Come
to
me
to-morrow
at
*NL*
the
office
,
at
nine
o'clock
.
At
the
office
,
mind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Garth
would
take
no
important
step
without
consulting
Susan
,
but
it
*NL*
must
be
confessed
that
before
he
reached
home
he
had
taken
his
*NL*
resolution
.
With
regard
to
a
large
number
of
matters
about
which
other
*NL*
men
are
decided
or
obstinate
,
he
was
the
most
easily
manageable
man
in
*NL*
the
world
.
He
never
knew
what
meat
he
would
choose
,
and
if
Susan
had
*NL*
said
that
they
ought
to
live
in
a
four-roomed
cottage
,
in
order
to
*NL*
save
,
he
would
have
said
,
``
Let
us
go
,
''
without
inquiring
into
details
.
*NL*
But
where
Caleb
's
feeling
and
judgment
strongly
pronounced
,
he
was
a
*NL*
ruler
;
and
in
spite
of
his
mildness
and
timidity
in
reproving
,
every
*NL*
one
about
him
knew
that
on
the
exceptional
occasions
when
he
chose
,
he
*NL*
was
absolute
.
He
never
,
indeed
,
chose
to
be
absolute
except
on
some
*NL*
one
else
's
behalf
.
On
ninety-nine
points
Mrs.
Garth
decided
,
but
on
*NL*
the
hundredth
she
was
often
aware
that
she
would
have
to
perform
the
*NL*
singularly
difficult
task
of
carrying
out
her
own
principle
,
and
to
*NL*
make
herself
subordinate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
come
round
as
I
thought
,
Susan
,
''
said
Caleb
,
when
they
were
*NL*
seated
alone
in
the
evening
.
He
had
already
narrated
the
adventure
*NL*
which
had
brought
about
Fred
's
sharing
in
his
work
,
but
had
kept
back
*NL*
the
further
result
.
``
The
children
_
are
_
fond
of
each
other
--
I
mean
,
*NL*
Fred
and
Mary
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Garth
laid
her
work
on
her
knee
,
and
fixed
her
penetrating
eyes
*NL*
anxiously
on
her
husband
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
After
we
'd
done
our
work
,
Fred
poured
it
all
out
to
me
.
He
ca
n't
bear
*NL*
to
be
a
clergyman
,
and
Mary
says
she
wo
n't
have
him
if
he
is
one
;
and
*NL*
the
lad
would
like
to
be
under
me
and
give
his
mind
to
business
.
And
*NL*
I
've
determined
to
take
him
and
make
a
man
of
him

*NL*
*NL*
``
Caleb

said
Mrs.
Garth
,
in
a
deep
contralto
,
expressive
of
resigned
*NL*
astonishment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
fine
thing
to
do

said
Mr.
Garth
,
settling
himself
firmly
*NL*
against
the
back
of
his
chair
,
and
grasping
the
elbows
.
``
I
shall
have
*NL*
trouble
with
him
,
but
I
think
I
shall
carry
it
through

The
lad
loves
*NL*
Mary
,
and
a
true
love
for
a
good
woman
is
a
great
thing
,
Susan
.
It
*NL*
shapes
many
a
rough
fellow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
Mary
spoken
to
you
on
the
subject
?
''
said
Mrs
Garth
,
secretly
a
*NL*
little
hurt
that
she
had
to
be
informed
on
it
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
a
word

I
asked
her
about
Fred
once

I
gave
her
a
bit
of
a
*NL*
warning

But
she
assured
me
she
would
never
marry
an
idle
*NL*
self-indulgent
man
--
nothing
since
.
But
it
seems
Fred
set
on
Mr.
*NL*
Farebrother
to
talk
to
her
,
because
she
had
forbidden
him
to
speak
*NL*
himself
,
and
Mr.
Farebrother
has
found
out
that
she
is
fond
of
Fred
,
*NL*
but
says
he
must
not
be
a
clergyman
.
Fred
's
heart
is
fixed
on
Mary
,
*NL*
that
I
can
see
:
it
gives
me
a
good
opinion
of
the
lad
--
and
we
always
*NL*
liked
him
,
Susan
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
pity
for
Mary
,
I
think
,
''
said
Mrs.
Garth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
--
a
pity
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
,
Caleb
,
she
might
have
had
a
man
who
is
worth
twenty
Fred
*NL*
Vincy
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
?
''
said
Caleb
,
with
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
firmly
believe
that
Mr.
Farebrother
is
attached
to
her
,
and
meant
to
*NL*
make
her
an
offer
;
but
of
course
,
now
that
Fred
has
used
him
as
an
*NL*
envoy
,
there
is
an
end
to
that
better
prospect
.
''
There
was
a
severe
*NL*
precision
in
Mrs.
Garth
's
utterance
.
She
was
vexed
and
disappointed
,
*NL*
but
she
was
bent
on
abstaining
from
useless
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
Caleb
was
silent
a
few
moments
under
a
conflict
of
feelings
.
He
looked
*NL*
at
the
floor
and
moved
his
head
and
hands
in
accompaniment
to
some
*NL*
inward
argumentation
.
At
last
he
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
would
have
made
me
very
proud
and
happy
,
Susan
,
and
I
should
have
*NL*
been
glad
for
your
sake
.
I
've
always
felt
that
your
belongings
have
*NL*
never
been
on
a
level
with
you
.
But
you
took
me
,
though
I
was
a
plain
*NL*
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
took
the
best
and
cleverest
man
I
had
ever
known
,
''
said
Mrs.
Garth
,
*NL*
convinced
that
_
she
_
would
never
have
loved
any
one
who
came
short
of
*NL*
that
mark
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
perhaps
others
thought
you
might
have
done
better
.
But
it
would
*NL*
have
been
worse
for
me
.
And
that
is
what
touches
me
close
about
Fred
.
*NL*
The
lad
is
good
at
bottom
,
and
clever
enough
to
do
,
if
he
's
put
in
the
*NL*
right
way
;
and
he
loves
and
honors
my
daughter
beyond
anything
,
and
she
*NL*
has
given
him
a
sort
of
promise
according
to
what
he
turns
out
.
I
say
,
*NL*
that
young
man
's
soul
is
in
my
hand
;
and
I
'll
do
the
best
I
can
for
*NL*
him
,
so
help
me
God
!
It
's
my
duty
,
Susan
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Garth
was
not
given
to
tears
,
but
there
was
a
large
one
rolling
*NL*
down
her
face
before
her
husband
had
finished
.
It
came
from
the
*NL*
pressure
of
various
feelings
,
in
which
there
was
much
affection
and
*NL*
some
vexation
.
She
wiped
it
away
quickly
,
saying
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Few
men
besides
you
would
think
it
a
duty
to
add
to
their
anxieties
in
*NL*
that
way
,
Caleb
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
signifies
nothing
--
what
other
men
would
think
.
I
've
got
a
clear
*NL*
feeling
inside
me
,
and
that
I
shall
follow
;
and
I
hope
your
heart
will
*NL*
go
with
me
,
Susan
,
in
making
everything
as
light
as
can
be
to
Mary
,
*NL*
poor
child
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Caleb
,
leaning
back
in
his
chair
,
looked
with
anxious
appeal
towards
*NL*
his
wife
.
She
rose
and
kissed
him
,
saying
,
``
God
bless
you
,
Caleb
!
Our
*NL*
children
have
a
good
father
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
went
out
and
had
a
hearty
cry
to
make
up
for
the
suppression
of
*NL*
her
words
.
She
felt
sure
that
her
husband
's
conduct
would
be
*NL*
misunderstood
,
and
about
Fred
she
was
rational
and
unhopeful
.
Which
*NL*
would
turn
out
to
have
the
more
foresight
in
it
--
her
rationality
or
*NL*
Caleb
's
ardent
generosity
?
*NL*
*NL*
When
Fred
went
to
the
office
the
next
morning
,
there
was
a
test
to
be
*NL*
gone
through
which
he
was
not
prepared
for
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
Fred
,
''
said
Caleb
,
``
you
will
have
some
desk-work
.
I
have
always
*NL*
done
a
good
deal
of
writing
myself
,
but
I
ca
n't
do
without
help
,
and
as
*NL*
I
want
you
to
understand
the
accounts
and
get
the
values
into
your
*NL*
head
,
I
mean
to
do
without
another
clerk
.
So
you
must
buckle
to
.
How
*NL*
are
you
at
writing
and
arithmetic
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fred
felt
an
awkward
movement
of
the
heart
;
he
had
not
thought
of
*NL*
desk-work
;
but
he
was
in
a
resolute
mood
,
and
not
going
to
shrink
.
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
afraid
of
arithmetic
,
Mr.
Garth
:
it
always
came
easily
to
me
.
*NL*
I
think
you
know
my
writing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
see
,
''
said
Caleb
,
taking
up
a
pen
,
examining
it
carefully
and
*NL*
handing
it
,
well
dipped
,
to
Fred
with
a
sheet
of
ruled
paper
.
``
Copy
me
*NL*
a
line
or
two
of
that
valuation
,
with
the
figures
at
the
end
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
time
the
opinion
existed
that
it
was
beneath
a
gentleman
to
*NL*
write
legibly
,
or
with
a
hand
in
the
least
suitable
to
a
clerk
.
Fred
*NL*
wrote
the
lines
demanded
in
a
hand
as
gentlemanly
as
that
of
any
*NL*
viscount
or
bishop
of
the
day
:
the
vowels
were
all
alike
and
the
*NL*
consonants
only
distinguishable
as
turning
up
or
down
,
the
strokes
had
*NL*
a
blotted
solidity
and
the
letters
disdained
to
keep
the
line
--
in
*NL*
short
,
it
was
a
manuscript
of
that
venerable
kind
easy
to
interpret
*NL*
when
you
know
beforehand
what
the
writer
means
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
Caleb
looked
on
,
his
visage
showed
a
growing
depression
,
but
when
*NL*
Fred
handed
him
the
paper
he
gave
something
like
a
snarl
,
and
rapped
*NL*
the
paper
passionately
with
the
back
of
his
hand
.
Bad
work
like
this
*NL*
dispelled
all
Caleb
's
mildness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
deuce
!
''
he
exclaimed
,
snarlingly
.
``
To
think
that
this
is
a
*NL*
country
where
a
man
's
education
may
cost
hundreds
and
hundreds
,
and
it
*NL*
turns
you
out
this
!
''
Then
in
a
more
pathetic
tone
,
pushing
up
his
*NL*
spectacles
and
looking
at
the
unfortunate
scribe
,
``
The
Lord
have
mercy
*NL*
on
us
,
Fred
,
I
ca
n't
put
up
with
this
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
can
I
do
,
Mr.
Garth
?
''
said
Fred
,
whose
spirits
had
sunk
very
low
,
*NL*
not
only
at
the
estimate
of
his
handwriting
,
but
at
the
vision
of
*NL*
himself
as
liable
to
be
ranked
with
office
clerks
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
?
Why
,
you
must
learn
to
form
your
letters
and
keep
the
line
.
*NL*
What
's
the
use
of
writing
at
all
if
nobody
can
understand
it
?
''
asked
*NL*
Caleb
,
energetically
,
quite
preoccupied
with
the
bad
quality
of
the
*NL*
work
.
``
Is
there
so
little
business
in
the
world
that
you
must
be
*NL*
sending
puzzles
over
the
country
?
But
that
's
the
way
people
are
*NL*
brought
up
.
I
should
lose
no
end
of
time
with
the
letters
some
people
*NL*
send
me
,
if
Susan
did
not
make
them
out
for
me
.
It
's
disgusting
.
''
Here
*NL*
Caleb
tossed
the
paper
from
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Any
stranger
peeping
into
the
office
at
that
moment
might
have
wondered
*NL*
what
was
the
drama
between
the
indignant
man
of
business
,
and
the
*NL*
fine-looking
young
fellow
whose
blond
complexion
was
getting
rather
*NL*
patchy
as
he
bit
his
lip
with
mortification
.
Fred
was
struggling
with
*NL*
many
thoughts
.
Mr.
Garth
had
been
so
kind
and
encouraging
at
the
*NL*
beginning
of
their
interview
,
that
gratitude
and
hopefulness
had
been
*NL*
at
a
high
pitch
,
and
the
downfall
was
proportionate
.
He
had
not
*NL*
thought
of
desk-work
--
in
fact
,
like
the
majority
of
young
gentlemen
,
he
*NL*
wanted
an
occupation
which
should
be
free
from
disagreeables
.
I
can
not
*NL*
tell
what
might
have
been
the
consequences
if
he
had
not
distinctly
*NL*
promised
himself
that
he
would
go
to
Lowick
to
see
Mary
and
tell
her
*NL*
that
he
was
engaged
to
work
under
her
father
.
He
did
not
like
to
*NL*
disappoint
himself
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
sorry
,
''
were
all
the
words
that
he
could
muster
.
But
Mr.
*NL*
Garth
was
already
relenting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
must
make
the
best
of
it
,
Fred
,
''
he
began
,
with
a
return
to
his
*NL*
usual
quiet
tone
.
``
Every
man
can
learn
to
write
.
I
taught
myself
.
Go
*NL*
at
it
with
a
will
,
and
sit
up
at
night
if
the
day-time
is
n't
enough
.
*NL*
We
'll
be
patient
,
my
boy
.
Callum
shall
go
on
with
the
books
for
a
bit
,
*NL*
while
you
are
learning
.
But
now
I
must
be
off
,
''
said
Caleb
,
rising
.
*NL*
``
You
must
let
your
father
know
our
agreement
.
You
'll
save
me
Callum
's
*NL*
salary
,
you
know
,
when
you
can
write
;
and
I
can
afford
to
give
you
*NL*
eighty
pounds
for
the
first
year
,
and
more
after
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
Fred
made
the
necessary
disclosure
to
his
parents
,
the
relative
*NL*
effect
on
the
two
was
a
surprise
which
entered
very
deeply
into
his
*NL*
memory
.
He
went
straight
from
Mr.
Garth
's
office
to
the
warehouse
,
*NL*
rightly
feeling
that
the
most
respectful
way
in
which
he
could
behave
*NL*
to
his
father
was
to
make
the
painful
communication
as
gravely
and
*NL*
formally
as
possible
.
Moreover
,
the
decision
would
be
more
certainly
*NL*
understood
to
be
final
,
if
the
interview
took
place
in
his
father
's
*NL*
gravest
hours
,
which
were
always
those
spent
in
his
private
room
at
the
*NL*
warehouse
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fred
entered
on
the
subject
directly
,
and
declared
briefly
what
he
had
*NL*
done
and
was
resolved
to
do
,
expressing
at
the
end
his
regret
that
he
*NL*
should
be
the
cause
of
disappointment
to
his
father
,
and
taking
the
*NL*
blame
on
his
own
deficiencies
.
The
regret
was
genuine
,
and
inspired
*NL*
Fred
with
strong
,
simple
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Vincy
listened
in
profound
surprise
without
uttering
even
an
*NL*
exclamation
,
a
silence
which
in
his
impatient
temperament
was
a
sign
of
*NL*
unusual
emotion
.
He
had
not
been
in
good
spirits
about
trade
that
*NL*
morning
,
and
the
slight
bitterness
in
his
lips
grew
intense
as
he
*NL*
listened
.
When
Fred
had
ended
,
there
was
a
pause
of
nearly
a
minute
,
*NL*
during
which
Mr.
Vincy
replaced
a
book
in
his
desk
and
turned
the
key
*NL*
emphatically
.
Then
he
looked
at
his
son
steadily
,
and
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
've
made
up
your
mind
at
last
,
sir
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
father
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
;
stick
to
it
.
I
've
no
more
to
say
.
You
've
thrown
away
your
*NL*
education
,
and
gone
down
a
step
in
life
,
when
I
had
given
you
the
means
*NL*
of
rising
,
that
's
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
sorry
that
we
differ
,
father
.
I
think
I
can
be
quite
as
*NL*
much
of
a
gentleman
at
the
work
I
have
undertaken
,
as
if
I
had
been
a
*NL*
curate
.
But
I
am
grateful
to
you
for
wishing
to
do
the
best
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
;
I
have
no
more
to
say
.
I
wash
my
hands
of
you
.
I
only
*NL*
hope
,
when
you
have
a
son
of
your
own
he
will
make
a
better
return
for
*NL*
the
pains
you
spend
on
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
very
cutting
to
Fred
.
His
father
was
using
that
unfair
*NL*
advantage
possessed
by
us
all
when
we
are
in
a
pathetic
situation
and
*NL*
see
our
own
past
as
if
it
were
simply
part
of
the
pathos
.
In
reality
,
*NL*
Mr.
Vincy
's
wishes
about
his
son
had
had
a
great
deal
of
pride
,
*NL*
inconsiderateness
,
and
egoistic
folly
in
them
.
But
still
the
*NL*
disappointed
father
held
a
strong
lever
;
and
Fred
felt
as
if
he
were
*NL*
being
banished
with
a
malediction
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
you
will
not
object
to
my
remaining
at
home
,
sir
?
''
he
said
,
*NL*
after
rising
to
go
;
``
I
shall
have
a
sufficient
salary
to
pay
for
my
*NL*
board
,
as
of
course
I
should
wish
to
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Board
be
hanged
!
''
said
Mr.
Vincy
,
recovering
himself
in
his
disgust
at
*NL*
the
notion
that
Fred
's
keep
would
be
missed
at
his
table
.
``
Of
course
*NL*
your
mother
will
want
you
to
stay
.
But
I
shall
keep
no
horse
for
you
,
*NL*
you
understand
;
and
you
will
pay
your
own
tailor
.
You
will
do
with
a
*NL*
suit
or
two
less
,
I
fancy
,
when
you
have
to
pay
for
'em
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fred
lingered
;
there
was
still
something
to
be
said
.
At
last
it
came
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
you
will
shake
hands
with
me
,
father
,
and
forgive
me
the
*NL*
vexation
I
have
caused
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Vincy
from
his
chair
threw
a
quick
glance
upward
at
his
son
,
who
*NL*
had
advanced
near
to
him
,
and
then
gave
his
hand
,
saying
hurriedly
,
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
let
us
say
no
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fred
went
through
much
more
narrative
and
explanation
with
his
mother
,
*NL*
but
she
was
inconsolable
,
having
before
her
eyes
what
perhaps
her
*NL*
husband
had
never
thought
of
,
the
certainty
that
Fred
would
marry
Mary
*NL*
Garth
,
that
her
life
would
henceforth
be
spoiled
by
a
perpetual
*NL*
infusion
of
Garths
and
their
ways
,
and
that
her
darling
boy
,
with
his
*NL*
beautiful
face
and
stylish
air
``
beyond
anybody
else
's
son
in
*NL*
Middlemarch
,
''
would
be
sure
to
get
like
that
family
in
plainness
of
*NL*
appearance
and
carelessness
about
his
clothes
.
To
her
it
seemed
that
*NL*
there
was
a
Garth
conspiracy
to
get
possession
of
the
desirable
Fred
,
*NL*
but
she
dared
not
enlarge
on
this
opinion
,
because
a
slight
hint
of
it
*NL*
had
made
him
``
fly
out
''
at
her
as
he
had
never
done
before
.
Her
temper
*NL*
was
too
sweet
for
her
to
show
any
anger
,
but
she
felt
that
her
*NL*
happiness
had
received
a
bruise
,
and
for
several
days
merely
to
look
at
*NL*
Fred
made
her
cry
a
little
as
if
he
were
the
subject
of
some
baleful
*NL*
prophecy
.
Perhaps
she
was
the
slower
to
recover
her
usual
cheerfulness
*NL*
because
Fred
had
warned
her
that
she
must
not
reopen
the
sore
question
*NL*
with
his
father
,
who
had
accepted
his
decision
and
forgiven
him
.
If
*NL*
her
husband
had
been
vehement
against
Fred
,
she
would
have
been
urged
*NL*
into
defence
of
her
darling
.
It
was
the
end
of
the
fourth
day
when
Mr.
*NL*
Vincy
said
to
her
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
Lucy
,
my
dear
,
do
n't
be
so
down-hearted
.
You
always
have
spoiled
*NL*
the
boy
,
and
you
must
go
on
spoiling
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
ever
did
cut
me
so
before
,
Vincy
,
''
said
the
wife
,
her
fair
*NL*
throat
and
chin
beginning
to
tremble
again
,
``
only
his
illness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pooh
,
pooh
,
never
mind
!
We
must
expect
to
have
trouble
with
our
*NL*
children
.
Do
n't
make
it
worse
by
letting
me
see
you
out
of
spirits
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
wo
n't
,
''
said
Mrs.
Vincy
,
roused
by
this
appeal
and
adjusting
*NL*
herself
with
a
little
shake
as
of
a
bird
which
lays
down
its
ruffled
*NL*
plumage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
wo
n't
do
to
begin
making
a
fuss
about
one
,
''
said
Mr.
Vincy
,
wishing
*NL*
to
combine
a
little
grumbling
with
domestic
cheerfulness
.
``
There
's
*NL*
Rosamond
as
well
as
Fred
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
poor
thing
.
I
'm
sure
I
felt
for
her
being
disappointed
of
her
*NL*
baby
;
but
she
got
over
it
nicely
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Baby
,
pooh
!
I
can
see
Lydgate
is
making
a
mess
of
his
practice
,
and
*NL*
getting
into
debt
too
,
by
what
I
hear
.
I
shall
have
Rosamond
coming
to
*NL*
me
with
a
pretty
tale
one
of
these
days
.
But
they
'll
get
no
money
from
*NL*
me
,
I
know
.
Let
_
his
_
family
help
him
.
I
never
did
like
that
*NL*
marriage
.
But
it
's
no
use
talking
.
Ring
the
bell
for
lemons
,
and
*NL*
do
n't
look
dull
any
more

Lucy

I
'll
drive
you
and
Louisa
to
Riverston
*NL*
to-morrow

CHAPTER
LVII
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
numbered
scarce
eight
summers
when
a
name
*NL*
Rose
on
their
souls
and
stirred
such
motions
there
*NL*
As
thrill
the
buds
and
shape
their
hidden
frame
*NL*
At
penetration
of
the
quickening
air
:
*NL*
His
name
who
told
of
loyal
Evan
Dhu
,
*NL*
Of
quaint
Bradwardine
,
and
Vich
Ian
Vor
,
*NL*
Making
the
little
world
their
childhood
knew
*NL*
Large
with
a
land
of
mountain
lake
and
scaur
,
*NL*
And
larger
yet
with
wonder
love
belief
*NL*
Toward
Walter
Scott
who
living
far
away
*NL*
Sent
them
this
wealth
of
joy
and
noble
grief

*NL*
The
book
and
they
must
part
,
but
day
by
day
,
*NL*
In
lines
that
thwart
like
portly
spiders
ran
*NL*
They
wrote
the
tale
,
from
Tully
Veolan
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
evening
that
Fred
Vincy
walked
to
Lowick
parsonage
-LRB-
he
had
begun
to
*NL*
see
that
this
was
a
world
in
which
even
a
spirited
young
man
must
*NL*
sometimes
walk
for
want
of
a
horse
to
carry
him
-RRB-
he
set
out
at
five
*NL*
o'clock
and
called
on
Mrs.
Garth
by
the
way
,
wishing
to
assure
himself
*NL*
that
she
accepted
their
new
relations
willingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
found
the
family
group
,
dogs
and
cats
included
,
under
the
great
*NL*
apple-tree
in
the
orchard
.
It
was
a
festival
with
Mrs.
Garth
,
for
her
*NL*
eldest
son
,
Christy
,
her
peculiar
joy
and
pride
,
had
come
home
for
a
*NL*
short
holiday
--
Christy
,
who
held
it
the
most
desirable
thing
in
the
*NL*
world
to
be
a
tutor
,
to
study
all
literatures
and
be
a
regenerate
*NL*
Porson
,
and
who
was
an
incorporate
criticism
on
poor
Fred
,
a
sort
of
*NL*
object-lesson
given
to
him
by
the
educational
mother
.
Christy
himself
,
*NL*
a
square-browed
,
broad-shouldered
masculine
edition
of
his
mother
not
*NL*
much
higher
than
Fred
's
shoulder
--
which
made
it
the
harder
that
he
*NL*
should
be
held
superior
--
was
always
as
simple
as
possible
,
and
thought
*NL*
no
more
of
Fred
's
disinclination
to
scholarship
than
of
a
giraffe
's
,
*NL*
wishing
that
he
himself
were
more
of
the
same
height
.
He
was
lying
on
*NL*
the
ground
now
by
his
mother
's
chair
,
with
his
straw
hat
laid
flat
over
*NL*
his
eyes
,
while
Jim
on
the
other
side
was
reading
aloud
from
that
*NL*
beloved
writer
who
has
made
a
chief
part
in
the
happiness
of
many
young
*NL*
lives
.
The
volume
was
``
Ivanhoe
,
''
and
Jim
was
in
the
great
archery
*NL*
scene
at
the
tournament
,
but
suffered
much
interruption
from
Ben
,
who
*NL*
had
fetched
his
own
old
bow
and
arrows
,
and
was
making
himself
*NL*
dreadfully
disagreeable
,
Letty
thought
,
by
begging
all
present
to
*NL*
observe
his
random
shots
,
which
no
one
wished
to
do
except
Brownie
,
the
*NL*
active-minded
but
probably
shallow
mongrel
,
while
the
grizzled
*NL*
Newfoundland
lying
in
the
sun
looked
on
with
the
dull-eyed
neutrality
*NL*
of
extreme
old
age
.
Letty
herself
,
showing
as
to
her
mouth
and
*NL*
pinafore
some
slight
signs
that
she
had
been
assisting
at
the
gathering
*NL*
of
the
cherries
which
stood
in
a
coral-heap
on
the
tea-table
,
was
now
*NL*
seated
on
the
grass
,
listening
open-eyed
to
the
reading
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
centre
of
interest
was
changed
for
all
by
the
arrival
of
Fred
*NL*
Vincy
.
When
,
seating
himself
on
a
garden-stool
,
he
said
that
he
was
on
*NL*
his
way
to
Lowick
Parsonage
,
Ben
,
who
had
thrown
down
his
bow
,
and
*NL*
snatched
up
a
reluctant
half-grown
kitten
instead
,
strode
across
Fred
's
*NL*
outstretched
leg
,
and
said
``
Take
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
and
me
too
,
''
said
Letty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ca
n't
keep
up
with
Fred
and
me
,
''
said
Ben
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
can
.
Mother
,
please
say
that
I
am
to
go
,
''
urged
Letty
,
whose
*NL*
life
was
much
checkered
by
resistance
to
her
depreciation
as
a
girl
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
stay
with
Christy
,
''
observed
Jim
;
as
much
as
to
say
that
he
*NL*
had
the
advantage
of
those
simpletons
;
whereupon
Letty
put
her
hand
up
*NL*
to
her
head
and
looked
with
jealous
indecision
from
the
one
to
the
*NL*
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
all
go
and
see
Mary
,
''
said
Christy
,
opening
his
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
my
dear
child
,
we
must
not
go
in
a
swarm
to
the
parsonage
.
And
*NL*
that
old
Glasgow
suit
of
yours
would
never
do
.
Besides
,
your
father
*NL*
will
come
home
.
We
must
let
Fred
go
alone
.
He
can
tell
Mary
that
you
*NL*
are
here
,
and
she
will
come
back
to-morrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Christy
glanced
at
his
own
threadbare
knees
,
and
then
at
Fred
's
*NL*
beautiful
white
trousers
.
Certainly
Fred
's
tailoring
suggested
the
*NL*
advantages
of
an
English
university
,
and
he
had
a
graceful
way
even
of
*NL*
looking
warm
and
of
pushing
his
hair
back
with
his
handkerchief
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Children
,
run
away
,
''
said
Mrs.
Garth
;
``
it
is
too
warm
to
hang
about
*NL*
your
friends
.
Take
your
brother
and
show
him
the
rabbits
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
eldest
understood
,
and
led
off
the
children
immediately
.
Fred
felt
*NL*
that
Mrs.
Garth
wished
to
give
him
an
opportunity
of
saying
anything
he
*NL*
had
to
say
,
but
he
could
only
begin
by
observing
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
glad
you
must
be
to
have
Christy
here
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
he
has
come
sooner
than
I
expected
.
He
got
down
from
the
coach
*NL*
at
nine
o'clock
,
just
after
his
father
went
out
.
I
am
longing
for
*NL*
Caleb
to
come
and
hear
what
wonderful
progress
Christy
is
making
.
He
*NL*
has
paid
his
expenses
for
the
last
year
by
giving
lessons
,
carrying
on
*NL*
hard
study
at
the
same
time
.
He
hopes
soon
to
get
a
private
tutorship
*NL*
and
go
abroad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
a
great
fellow
,
''
said
Fred
,
to
whom
these
cheerful
truths
had
a
*NL*
medicinal
taste
,
``
and
no
trouble
to
anybody
.
''
After
a
slight
pause
,
he
*NL*
added
,
``
But
I
fear
you
will
think
that
I
am
going
to
be
a
great
deal
of
*NL*
trouble
to
Mr.
Garth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Caleb
likes
taking
trouble
:
he
is
one
of
those
men
who
always
do
more
*NL*
than
any
one
would
have
thought
of
asking
them
to
do
,
''
answered
Mrs.
*NL*
Garth
.
She
was
knitting
,
and
could
either
look
at
Fred
or
not
,
as
she
*NL*
chose
--
always
an
advantage
when
one
is
bent
on
loading
speech
with
*NL*
salutary
meaning
;
and
though
Mrs.
Garth
intended
to
be
duly
reserved
,
*NL*
she
did
wish
to
say
something
that
Fred
might
be
the
better
for
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
you
think
me
very
undeserving
,
Mrs.
Garth
,
and
with
good
*NL*
reason
,
''
said
Fred
,
his
spirit
rising
a
little
at
the
perception
of
*NL*
something
like
a
disposition
to
lecture
him
.
``
I
happen
to
have
behaved
*NL*
just
the
worst
to
the
people
I
ca
n't
help
wishing
for
the
most
from
.
*NL*
But
while
two
men
like
Mr.
Garth
and
Mr.
Farebrother
have
not
given
me
*NL*
up
,
I
do
n't
see
why
I
should
give
myself
up
.
''
Fred
thought
it
might
be
*NL*
well
to
suggest
these
masculine
examples
to
Mrs.
Garth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Assuredly
,
''
said
she
,
with
gathering
emphasis
.
``
A
young
man
for
whom
*NL*
two
such
elders
had
devoted
themselves
would
indeed
be
culpable
if
he
*NL*
threw
himself
away
and
made
their
sacrifices
vain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fred
wondered
a
little
at
this
strong
language
,
but
only
said
,
``
I
hope
*NL*
it
will
not
be
so
with
me
,
Mrs.
Garth
,
since
I
have
some
encouragement
*NL*
to
believe
that
I
may
win
Mary
.
Mr.
Garth
has
told
you
about
that
?
*NL*
You
were
not
surprised
,
I
dare
say
?
''
Fred
ended
,
innocently
referring
*NL*
only
to
his
own
love
as
probably
evident
enough
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
surprised
that
Mary
has
given
you
encouragement
?
''
returned
Mrs.
*NL*
Garth
,
who
thought
it
would
be
well
for
Fred
to
be
more
alive
to
the
*NL*
fact
that
Mary
's
friends
could
not
possibly
have
wished
this
*NL*
beforehand
,
whatever
the
Vincys
might
suppose
.
``
Yes
,
I
confess
I
was
*NL*
surprised
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
never
did
give
me
any
--
not
the
least
in
the
world
,
when
I
talked
*NL*
to
her
myself
,
''
said
Fred
,
eager
to
vindicate
Mary
.
``
But
when
I
asked
*NL*
Mr.
Farebrother
to
speak
for
me
,
she
allowed
him
to
tell
me
there
was
a
*NL*
hope
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
power
of
admonition
which
had
begun
to
stir
in
Mrs.
Garth
had
not
*NL*
yet
discharged
itself
.
It
was
a
little
too
provoking
even
for
_
her
_
*NL*
self-control
that
this
blooming
youngster
should
flourish
on
the
*NL*
disappointments
of
sadder
and
wiser
people
--
making
a
meal
of
a
*NL*
nightingale
and
never
knowing
it
--
and
that
all
the
while
his
family
*NL*
should
suppose
that
hers
was
in
eager
need
of
this
sprig
;
and
her
*NL*
vexation
had
fermented
the
more
actively
because
of
its
total
*NL*
repression
towards
her
husband
.
Exemplary
wives
will
sometimes
find
*NL*
scapegoats
in
this
way
.
She
now
said
with
energetic
decision
,
``
You
*NL*
made
a
great
mistake
,
Fred
,
in
asking
Mr.
Farebrother
to
speak
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
I
?
''
said
Fred
,
reddening
instantaneously
.
He
was
alarmed
,
but
at
*NL*
a
loss
to
know
what
Mrs.
Garth
meant
,
and
added
,
in
an
apologetic
tone
,
*NL*
``
Mr.
Farebrother
has
always
been
such
a
friend
of
ours
;
and
Mary
,
I
*NL*
knew
,
would
listen
to
him
gravely
;
and
he
took
it
on
himself
quite
*NL*
readily
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
young
people
are
usually
blind
to
everything
but
their
own
*NL*
wishes
,
and
seldom
imagine
how
much
those
wishes
cost
others
,
''
said
*NL*
Mrs.
Garth
.
She
did
not
mean
to
go
beyond
this
salutary
general
*NL*
doctrine
,
and
threw
her
indignation
into
a
needless
unwinding
of
her
*NL*
worsted
,
knitting
her
brow
at
it
with
a
grand
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
conceive
how
it
could
be
any
pain
to
Mr.
Farebrother
,
''
said
*NL*
Fred
,
who
nevertheless
felt
that
surprising
conceptions
were
beginning
*NL*
to
form
themselves
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Precisely
;
you
can
not
conceive
,
''
said
Mrs.
Garth
,
cutting
her
words
as
*NL*
neatly
as
possible
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
moment
Fred
looked
at
the
horizon
with
a
dismayed
anxiety
,
and
*NL*
then
turning
with
a
quick
movement
said
almost
sharply
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
mean
to
say
,
Mrs.
Garth
,
that
Mr.
Farebrother
is
in
love
with
*NL*
Mary
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
if
it
were
so
,
Fred
,
I
think
you
are
the
last
person
who
ought
to
*NL*
be
surprised
,
''
returned
Mrs.
Garth
,
laying
her
knitting
down
beside
her
*NL*
and
folding
her
arms
.
It
was
an
unwonted
sign
of
emotion
in
her
that
*NL*
she
should
put
her
work
out
of
her
hands
.
In
fact
her
feelings
were
*NL*
divided
between
the
satisfaction
of
giving
Fred
his
discipline
and
the
*NL*
sense
of
having
gone
a
little
too
far
.
Fred
took
his
hat
and
stick
and
*NL*
rose
quickly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
think
I
am
standing
in
his
way
,
and
in
Mary
's
too
?
''
he
said
,
*NL*
in
a
tone
which
seemed
to
demand
an
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Garth
could
not
speak
immediately
.
She
had
brought
herself
into
*NL*
the
unpleasant
position
of
being
called
on
to
say
what
she
really
felt
,
*NL*
yet
what
she
knew
there
were
strong
reasons
for
concealing
.
And
to
her
*NL*
the
consciousness
of
having
exceeded
in
words
was
peculiarly
*NL*
mortifying
.
Besides
,
Fred
had
given
out
unexpected
electricity
,
and
he
*NL*
now
added
,
``
Mr.
Garth
seemed
pleased
that
Mary
should
be
attached
to
*NL*
me
.
He
could
not
have
known
anything
of
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Garth
felt
a
severe
twinge
at
this
mention
of
her
husband
,
the
*NL*
fear
that
Caleb
might
think
her
in
the
wrong
not
being
easily
*NL*
endurable
.
She
answered
,
wanting
to
check
unintended
consequences
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
spoke
from
inference
only
.
I
am
not
aware
that
Mary
knows
anything
*NL*
of
the
matter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
hesitated
to
beg
that
he
would
keep
entire
silence
on
a
subject
*NL*
which
she
had
herself
unnecessarily
mentioned
,
not
being
used
to
stoop
*NL*
in
that
way
;
and
while
she
was
hesitating
there
was
already
a
rush
of
*NL*
unintended
consequences
under
the
apple-tree
where
the
tea-things
*NL*
stood
.
Ben
,
bouncing
across
the
grass
with
Brownie
at
his
heels
,
and
*NL*
seeing
the
kitten
dragging
the
knitting
by
a
lengthening
line
of
wool
,
*NL*
shouted
and
clapped
his
hands
;
Brownie
barked
,
the
kitten
,
desperate
,
*NL*
jumped
on
the
tea-table
and
upset
the
milk
,
then
jumped
down
again
and
*NL*
swept
half
the
cherries
with
it
;
and
Ben
,
snatching
up
the
half-knitted
*NL*
sock-top
,
fitted
it
over
the
kitten
's
head
as
a
new
source
of
madness
,
*NL*
while
Letty
arriving
cried
out
to
her
mother
against
this
cruelty
--
it
*NL*
was
a
history
as
full
of
sensation
as
``
This
is
the
house
that
Jack
*NL*
built
.
''
Mrs.
Garth
was
obliged
to
interfere
,
the
other
young
ones
came
*NL*
up
and
the
tete-a-tete
with
Fred
was
ended
.
He
got
away
as
soon
as
he
*NL*
could
,
and
Mrs.
Garth
could
only
imply
some
retractation
of
her
*NL*
severity
by
saying
``
God
bless
you
''
when
she
shook
hands
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
unpleasantly
conscious
that
she
had
been
on
the
verge
of
*NL*
speaking
as
``
one
of
the
foolish
women
speaketh
''
--
telling
first
and
*NL*
entreating
silence
after
.
But
she
had
not
entreated
silence
,
and
to
*NL*
prevent
Caleb
's
blame
she
determined
to
blame
herself
and
confess
all
*NL*
to
him
that
very
night
.
It
was
curious
what
an
awful
tribunal
the
mild
*NL*
Caleb
's
was
to
her
,
whenever
he
set
it
up
.
But
she
meant
to
point
out
*NL*
to
him
that
the
revelation
might
do
Fred
Vincy
a
great
deal
of
good
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
doubt
it
was
having
a
strong
effect
on
him
as
he
walked
to
Lowick
.
*NL*
Fred
's
light
hopeful
nature
had
perhaps
never
had
so
much
of
a
bruise
*NL*
as
from
this
suggestion
that
if
he
had
been
out
of
the
way
Mary
might
*NL*
have
made
a
thoroughly
good
match
.
Also
he
was
piqued
that
he
had
been
*NL*
what
he
called
such
a
stupid
lout
as
to
ask
that
intervention
from
Mr.
*NL*
Farebrother
.
But
it
was
not
in
a
lover
's
nature
--
it
was
not
in
*NL*
Fred
's
,
that
the
new
anxiety
raised
about
Mary
's
feeling
should
not
*NL*
surmount
every
other
.
Notwithstanding
his
trust
in
Mr.
Farebrother
's
*NL*
generosity
,
notwithstanding
what
Mary
had
said
to
him
,
Fred
could
not
*NL*
help
feeling
that
he
had
a
rival
:
it
was
a
new
consciousness
,
and
he
*NL*
objected
to
it
extremely
,
not
being
in
the
least
ready
to
give
up
Mary
*NL*
for
her
good
,
being
ready
rather
to
fight
for
her
with
any
man
*NL*
whatsoever
.
But
the
fighting
with
Mr.
Farebrother
must
be
of
a
*NL*
metaphorical
kind
,
which
was
much
more
difficult
to
Fred
than
the
*NL*
muscular
.
Certainly
this
experience
was
a
discipline
for
Fred
hardly
*NL*
less
sharp
than
his
disappointment
about
his
uncle
's
will
.
The
iron
*NL*
had
not
entered
into
his
soul
,
but
he
had
begun
to
imagine
what
the
*NL*
sharp
edge
would
be
.
It
did
not
once
occur
to
Fred
that
Mrs.
Garth
*NL*
might
be
mistaken
about
Mr.
Farebrother
,
but
he
suspected
that
she
*NL*
might
be
wrong
about
Mary
.
Mary
had
been
staying
at
the
parsonage
*NL*
lately
,
and
her
mother
might
know
very
little
of
what
had
been
passing
*NL*
in
her
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
feel
easier
when
he
found
her
looking
cheerful
with
the
*NL*
three
ladies
in
the
drawing-room
.
They
were
in
animated
discussion
on
*NL*
some
subject
which
was
dropped
when
he
entered
,
and
Mary
was
copying
*NL*
the
labels
from
a
heap
of
shallow
cabinet
drawers
,
in
a
minute
*NL*
handwriting
which
she
was
skilled
in
.
Mr.
Farebrother
was
somewhere
in
*NL*
the
village
,
and
the
three
ladies
knew
nothing
of
Fred
's
peculiar
*NL*
relation
to
Mary
:
it
was
impossible
for
either
of
them
to
propose
that
*NL*
they
should
walk
round
the
garden
,
and
Fred
predicted
to
himself
that
*NL*
he
should
have
to
go
away
without
saying
a
word
to
her
in
private
.
He
*NL*
told
her
first
of
Christy
's
arrival
and
then
of
his
own
engagement
with
*NL*
her
father
;
and
he
was
comforted
by
seeing
that
this
latter
news
*NL*
touched
her
keenly
.
She
said
hurriedly
,
``
I
am
so
glad
,
''
and
then
bent
*NL*
over
her
writing
to
hinder
any
one
from
noticing
her
face
.
But
here
*NL*
was
a
subject
which
Mrs.
Farebrother
could
not
let
pass
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
mean
,
my
dear
Miss
Garth
,
that
you
are
glad
to
hear
of
a
*NL*
young
man
giving
up
the
Church
for
which
he
was
educated
:
you
only
mean
*NL*
that
things
being
so
,
you
are
glad
that
he
should
be
under
an
excellent
*NL*
man
like
your
father
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
really
,
Mrs.
Farebrother
,
I
am
glad
of
both
,
I
fear
,
''
said
Mary
,
*NL*
cleverly
getting
rid
of
one
rebellious
tear
.
``
I
have
a
dreadfully
*NL*
secular
mind
.
I
never
liked
any
clergyman
except
the
Vicar
of
*NL*
Wakefield
and
Mr.
Farebrother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
why
,
my
dear
?
''
said
Mrs.
Farebrother
,
pausing
on
her
large
wooden
*NL*
knitting-needles
and
looking
at
Mary
.
``
You
have
always
a
good
reason
*NL*
for
your
opinions
,
but
this
astonishes
me
.
Of
course
I
put
out
of
the
*NL*
question
those
who
preach
new
doctrine
.
But
why
should
you
dislike
*NL*
clergymen
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
dear
,
''
said
Mary
,
her
face
breaking
into
merriment
as
she
seemed
to
*NL*
consider
a
moment
,
``
I
do
n't
like
their
neckcloths
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
you
do
n't
like
Camden
's
,
then
,
''
said
Miss
Winifred
,
in
some
*NL*
anxiety
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
do
,
''
said
Mary
.
``
I
do
n't
like
the
other
clergymen
's
*NL*
neckcloths
,
because
it
is
they
who
wear
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
very
puzzling
!
''
said
Miss
Noble
,
feeling
that
her
own
intellect
*NL*
was
probably
deficient
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
,
you
are
joking
.
You
would
have
better
reasons
than
these
for
*NL*
slighting
so
respectable
a
class
of
men
,
''
said
Mrs.
Farebrother
,
*NL*
majestically
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Garth
has
such
severe
notions
of
what
people
should
be
that
it
is
*NL*
difficult
to
satisfy
her
,
''
said
Fred
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
am
glad
at
least
that
she
makes
an
exception
in
favor
of
my
*NL*
son
,
''
said
the
old
lady
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
was
wondering
at
Fred
's
piqued
tone
,
when
Mr.
Farebrother
came
in
*NL*
and
had
to
hear
the
news
about
the
engagement
under
Mr.
Garth
.
At
the
*NL*
end
he
said
with
quiet
satisfaction
,
''
_
That
_
is
right
;
''
and
then
bent
*NL*
to
look
at
Mary
's
labels
and
praise
her
handwriting
.
Fred
felt
*NL*
horribly
jealous
--
was
glad
,
of
course
,
that
Mr.
Farebrother
was
so
*NL*
estimable
,
but
wished
that
he
had
been
ugly
and
fat
as
men
at
forty
*NL*
sometimes
are
.
It
was
clear
what
the
end
would
be
,
since
Mary
openly
*NL*
placed
Farebrother
above
everybody
,
and
these
women
were
all
evidently
*NL*
encouraging
the
affair
.
He
was
feeling
sure
that
he
should
have
no
*NL*
chance
of
speaking
to
Mary
,
when
Mr.
Farebrother
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fred
,
help
me
to
carry
these
drawers
back
into
my
study
--
you
have
*NL*
never
seen
my
fine
new
study
.
Pray
come
too
,
Miss
Garth
.
I
want
you
*NL*
to
see
a
stupendous
spider
I
found
this
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
at
once
saw
the
Vicar
's
intention
.
He
had
never
since
the
*NL*
memorable
evening
deviated
from
his
old
pastoral
kindness
towards
her
,
*NL*
and
her
momentary
wonder
and
doubt
had
quite
gone
to
sleep
.
Mary
was
*NL*
accustomed
to
think
rather
rigorously
of
what
was
probable
,
and
if
a
*NL*
belief
flattered
her
vanity
she
felt
warned
to
dismiss
it
as
*NL*
ridiculous
,
having
early
had
much
exercise
in
such
dismissals
.
It
was
*NL*
as
she
had
foreseen
:
when
Fred
had
been
asked
to
admire
the
fittings
of
*NL*
the
study
,
and
she
had
been
asked
to
admire
the
spider
,
Mr.
Farebrother
*NL*
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait
here
a
minute
or
two
.
I
am
going
to
look
out
an
engraving
which
*NL*
Fred
is
tall
enough
to
hang
for
me
.
I
shall
be
back
in
a
few
minutes
.
''
*NL*
And
then
he
went
out
.
Nevertheless
,
the
first
word
Fred
said
to
Mary
*NL*
was
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
of
no
use
,
whatever
I
do
,
Mary
.
You
are
sure
to
marry
*NL*
Farebrother
at
last
.
''
There
was
some
rage
in
his
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
,
Fred
?
''
Mary
exclaimed
indignantly
,
blushing
deeply
,
*NL*
and
surprised
out
of
all
her
readiness
in
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
impossible
that
you
should
not
see
it
all
clearly
enough
--
you
*NL*
who
see
everything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
only
see
that
you
are
behaving
very
ill
,
Fred
,
in
speaking
so
of
Mr.
*NL*
Farebrother
after
he
has
pleaded
your
cause
in
every
way
.
How
can
you
*NL*
have
taken
up
such
an
idea
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fred
was
rather
deep
,
in
spite
of
his
irritation
.
If
Mary
had
really
*NL*
been
unsuspicious
,
there
was
no
good
in
telling
her
what
Mrs.
Garth
had
*NL*
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
follows
as
a
matter
of
course
,
''
he
replied
.
``
When
you
are
*NL*
continually
seeing
a
man
who
beats
me
in
everything
,
and
whom
you
set
*NL*
up
above
everybody
,
I
can
have
no
fair
chance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
very
ungrateful
,
Fred
,
''
said
Mary
.
``
I
wish
I
had
never
told
*NL*
Mr.
Farebrother
that
I
cared
for
you
in
the
least
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
am
not
ungrateful
;
I
should
be
the
happiest
fellow
in
the
world
*NL*
if
it
were
not
for
this
.
I
told
your
father
everything
,
and
he
was
*NL*
very
kind
;
he
treated
me
as
if
I
were
his
son
.
I
could
go
at
the
work
*NL*
with
a
will
,
writing
and
everything
,
if
it
were
not
for
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
this
?
for
what
?
''
said
Mary
,
imagining
now
that
something
specific
*NL*
must
have
been
said
or
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
dreadful
certainty
that
I
shall
be
bowled
out
by
Farebrother
.
''
*NL*
Mary
was
appeased
by
her
inclination
to
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fred
,
''
she
said
,
peeping
round
to
catch
his
eyes
,
which
were
sulkily
*NL*
turned
away
from
her
,
``
you
are
too
delightfully
ridiculous
.
If
you
*NL*
were
not
such
a
charming
simpleton
,
what
a
temptation
this
would
be
to
*NL*
play
the
wicked
coquette
,
and
let
you
suppose
that
somebody
besides
you
*NL*
has
made
love
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
really
like
me
best
,
Mary
?
''
said
Fred
,
turning
eyes
full
of
*NL*
affection
on
her
,
and
trying
to
take
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
like
you
at
all
at
this
moment
,
''
said
Mary
,
retreating
,
and
*NL*
putting
her
hands
behind
her
.
``
I
only
said
that
no
mortal
ever
made
*NL*
love
to
me
besides
you
.
And
that
is
no
argument
that
a
very
wise
man
*NL*
ever
will

''
she
ended
,
merrily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
you
would
tell
me
that
you
could
not
possibly
ever
think
of
*NL*
him
,

said
Fred
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
dare
to
mention
this
any
more
to
me

Fred

said
Mary
,
getting
*NL*
serious
again
.
``
I
do
n't
know
whether
it
is
more
stupid
or
ungenerous
*NL*
in
you
not
to
see
that
Mr.
Farebrother
has
left
us
together
on
purpose
*NL*
that
we
might
speak
freely
.
I
am
disappointed
that
you
should
be
so
*NL*
blind
to
his
delicate
feeling
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
time
to
say
any
more
before
Mr.
Farebrother
came
back
with
*NL*
the
engraving
;
and
Fred
had
to
return
to
the
drawing-room
still
with
a
*NL*
jealous
dread
in
his
heart
,
but
yet
with
comforting
arguments
from
*NL*
Mary
's
words
and
manner
.
The
result
of
the
conversation
was
on
the
*NL*
whole
more
painful
to
Mary
:
inevitably
her
attention
had
taken
a
new
*NL*
attitude
,
and
she
saw
the
possibility
of
new
interpretations
.
She
was
*NL*
in
a
position
in
which
she
seemed
to
herself
to
be
slighting
Mr.
*NL*
Farebrother
,
and
this
,
in
relation
to
a
man
who
is
much
honored
,
is
*NL*
always
dangerous
to
the
firmness
of
a
grateful
woman
.
To
have
a
reason
*NL*
for
going
home
the
next
day
was
a
relief
,
for
Mary
earnestly
desired
to
*NL*
be
always
clear
that
she
loved
Fred
best
.
When
a
tender
affection
has
*NL*
been
storing
itself
in
us
through
many
of
our
years
,
the
idea
that
we
*NL*
could
accept
any
exchange
for
it
seems
to
be
a
cheapening
of
our
lives
.
*NL*
And
we
can
set
a
watch
over
our
affections
and
our
constancy
as
we
can
*NL*
over
other
treasures
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fred
has
lost
all
his
other
expectations
;
he
must
keep
this
,
''
Mary
*NL*
said
to
herself
,
with
a
smile
curling
her
lips
.
It
was
impossible
to
*NL*
help
fleeting
visions
of
another
kind
--
new
dignities
and
an
*NL*
acknowledged
value
of
which
she
had
often
felt
the
absence
.
But
these
*NL*
things
with
Fred
outside
them
,
Fred
forsaken
and
looking
sad
for
the
*NL*
want
of
her
,
could
never
tempt
her
deliberate
thought
.

SHAKESPEARE
:
Sonnets
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
time
when
Mr.
Vincy
uttered
that
presentiment
about
Rosamond
,
*NL*
she
herself
had
never
had
the
idea
that
she
should
be
driven
to
make
*NL*
the
sort
of
appeal
which
he
foresaw
.
She
had
not
yet
had
any
anxiety
*NL*
about
ways
and
means
,
although
her
domestic
life
had
been
expensive
as
*NL*
well
as
eventful
.
Her
baby
had
been
born
prematurely
,
and
all
the
*NL*
embroidered
robes
and
caps
had
to
be
laid
by
in
darkness
.
This
*NL*
misfortune
was
attributed
entirely
to
her
having
persisted
in
going
out
*NL*
on
horseback
one
day
when
her
husband
had
desired
her
not
to
do
so
;
but
*NL*
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
she
had
shown
temper
on
the
occasion
,
or
*NL*
rudely
told
him
that
she
would
do
as
she
liked
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
led
her
particularly
to
desire
horse-exercise
was
a
visit
from
*NL*
Captain
Lydgate
,
the
baronet
's
third
son
,
who
,
I
am
sorry
to
say
,
was
*NL*
detested
by
our
Tertius
of
that
name
as
a
vapid
fop
``
parting
his
hair
*NL*
from
brow
to
nape
in
a
despicable
fashion
''
-LRB-
not
followed
by
Tertius
*NL*
himself
-RRB-
,
and
showing
an
ignorant
security
that
he
knew
the
proper
*NL*
thing
to
say
on
every
topic
.
Lydgate
inwardly
cursed
his
own
folly
*NL*
that
he
had
drawn
down
this
visit
by
consenting
to
go
to
his
uncle
's
on
*NL*
the
wedding-tour
,
and
he
made
himself
rather
disagreeable
to
Rosamond
*NL*
by
saying
so
in
private
.
For
to
Rosamond
this
visit
was
a
source
of
*NL*
unprecedented
but
gracefully
concealed
exultation
.
She
was
so
*NL*
intensely
conscious
of
having
a
cousin
who
was
a
baronet
's
son
staying
*NL*
in
the
house
,
that
she
imagined
the
knowledge
of
what
was
implied
by
*NL*
his
presence
to
be
diffused
through
all
other
minds
;
and
when
she
*NL*
introduced
Captain
Lydgate
to
her
guests
,
she
had
a
placid
sense
that
*NL*
his
rank
penetrated
them
as
if
it
had
been
an
odor
.
The
satisfaction
*NL*
was
enough
for
the
time
to
melt
away
some
disappointment
in
the
*NL*
conditions
of
marriage
with
a
medical
man
even
of
good
birth
:
it
seemed
*NL*
now
that
her
marriage
was
visibly
as
well
as
ideally
floating
her
above
*NL*
the
Middlemarch
level
,
and
the
future
looked
bright
with
letters
and
*NL*
visits
to
and
from
Quallingham
,
and
vague
advancement
in
consequence
*NL*
for
Tertius
.
Especially
as
,
probably
at
the
Captain
's
suggestion
,
his
*NL*
married
sister
,
Mrs.
Mengan
,
had
come
with
her
maid
,
and
stayed
two
*NL*
nights
on
her
way
from
town
.
Hence
it
was
clearly
worth
while
for
*NL*
Rosamond
to
take
pains
with
her
music
and
the
careful
selection
of
her
*NL*
lace
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
to
Captain
Lydgate
himself
,
his
low
brow
,
his
aquiline
nose
bent
on
*NL*
one
side
,
and
his
rather
heavy
utterance
,
might
have
been
*NL*
disadvantageous
in
any
young
gentleman
who
had
not
a
military
bearing
*NL*
and
mustache
to
give
him
what
is
doted
on
by
some
flower-like
blond
*NL*
heads
as
``
style
.
''
He
had
,
moreover
,
that
sort
of
high-breeding
which
*NL*
consists
in
being
free
from
the
petty
solicitudes
of
middle-class
*NL*
gentility
,
and
he
was
a
great
critic
of
feminine
charms
.
Rosamond
*NL*
delighted
in
his
admiration
now
even
more
than
she
had
done
at
*NL*
Quallingham
,
and
he
found
it
easy
to
spend
several
hours
of
the
day
in
*NL*
flirting
with
her
.
The
visit
altogether
was
one
of
the
pleasantest
*NL*
larks
he
had
ever
had
,
not
the
less
so
perhaps
because
he
suspected
*NL*
that
his
queer
cousin
Tertius
wished
him
away
:
though
Lydgate
,
who
*NL*
would
rather
-LRB-
hyperbolically
speaking
-RRB-
have
died
than
have
failed
in
*NL*
polite
hospitality
,
suppressed
his
dislike
,
and
only
pretended
*NL*
generally
not
to
hear
what
the
gallant
officer
said
,
consigning
the
*NL*
task
of
answering
him
to
Rosamond
.
For
he
was
not
at
all
a
jealous
*NL*
husband
,
and
preferred
leaving
a
feather-headed
young
gentleman
alone
*NL*
with
his
wife
to
bearing
him
company
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
you
would
talk
more
to
the
Captain
at
dinner
,
Tertius
,
''
said
*NL*
Rosamond
,
one
evening
when
the
important
guest
was
gone
to
Loamford
to
*NL*
see
some
brother
officers
stationed
there
.
``
You
really
look
so
absent
*NL*
sometimes
--
you
seem
to
be
seeing
through
his
head
into
something
behind
*NL*
it
,
instead
of
looking
at
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Rosy
,
you
do
n't
expect
me
to
talk
much
to
such
a
conceited
ass
*NL*
as
that
,
I
hope
,
''
said
Lydgate
,
brusquely
.
``
If
he
got
his
head
broken
,
*NL*
I
might
look
at
it
with
interest
,
not
before
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
conceive
why
you
should
speak
of
your
cousin
so
*NL*
contemptuously
,
''
said
Rosamond
,
her
fingers
moving
at
her
work
while
*NL*
she
spoke
with
a
mild
gravity
which
had
a
touch
of
disdain
in
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ask
Ladislaw
if
he
does
n't
think
your
Captain
the
greatest
bore
he
*NL*
ever
met
with
.
Ladislaw
has
almost
forsaken
the
house
since
he
came
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Rosamond
thought
she
knew
perfectly
well
why
Mr.
Ladislaw
disliked
the
*NL*
Captain
:
he
was
jealous
,
and
she
liked
his
being
jealous
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
impossible
to
say
what
will
suit
eccentric
persons
,
''
she
*NL*
answered
,
``
but
in
my
opinion
Captain
Lydgate
is
a
thorough
gentleman
,
*NL*
and
I
think
you
ought
not
,
out
of
respect
to
Sir
Godwin
,
to
treat
him
*NL*
with
neglect
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
dear
;
but
we
have
had
dinners
for
him
.
And
he
comes
in
and
goes
*NL*
out
as
he
likes
.
He
does
n't
want
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Still
,
when
he
is
in
the
room
,
you
might
show
him
more
attention
.
He
*NL*
may
not
be
a
phoenix
of
cleverness
in
your
sense
;
his
profession
is
*NL*
different
;
but
it
would
be
all
the
better
for
you
to
talk
a
little
on
*NL*
his
subjects
.
_
I
_
think
his
conversation
is
quite
agreeable
.
And
he
*NL*
is
anything
but
an
unprincipled
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
fact
is
,
you
would
wish
me
to
be
a
little
more
like
him
,
Rosy
,
''
*NL*
said
Lydgate
,
in
a
sort
of
resigned
murmur
,
with
a
smile
which
was
not
*NL*
exactly
tender
,
and
certainly
not
merry
.
Rosamond
was
silent
and
did
*NL*
not
smile
again
;
but
the
lovely
curves
of
her
face
looked
good-tempered
*NL*
enough
without
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
Those
words
of
Lydgate
's
were
like
a
sad
milestone
marking
how
far
he
*NL*
had
travelled
from
his
old
dreamland
,
in
which
Rosamond
Vincy
appeared
*NL*
to
be
that
perfect
piece
of
womanhood
who
would
reverence
her
husband
's
*NL*
mind
after
the
fashion
of
an
accomplished
mermaid
,
using
her
comb
and
*NL*
looking-glass
and
singing
her
song
for
the
relaxation
of
his
adored
*NL*
wisdom
alone
.
He
had
begun
to
distinguish
between
that
imagined
*NL*
adoration
and
the
attraction
towards
a
man
's
talent
because
it
gives
*NL*
him
prestige
,
and
is
like
an
order
in
his
button-hole
or
an
Honorable
*NL*
before
his
name
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
might
have
been
supposed
that
Rosamond
had
travelled
too
,
since
she
*NL*
had
found
the
pointless
conversation
of
Mr.
Ned
Plymdale
perfectly
*NL*
wearisome
;
but
to
most
mortals
there
is
a
stupidity
which
is
*NL*
unendurable
and
a
stupidity
which
is
altogether
acceptable
--
else
,
*NL*
indeed
,
what
would
become
of
social
bonds
?
Captain
Lydgate
's
stupidity
*NL*
was
delicately
scented
,
carried
itself
with
``
style
,
''
talked
with
a
good
*NL*
accent
,
and
was
closely
related
to
Sir
Godwin
.
Rosamond
found
it
quite
*NL*
agreeable
and
caught
many
of
its
phrases
.
*NL*
*NL*
Therefore
since
Rosamond
,
as
we
know
,
was
fond
of
horseback
,
there
were
*NL*
plenty
of
reasons
why
she
should
be
tempted
to
resume
her
riding
when
*NL*
Captain
Lydgate
,
who
had
ordered
his
man
with
two
horses
to
follow
him
*NL*
and
put
up
at
the
``
Green
Dragon
,
''
begged
her
to
go
out
on
the
gray
*NL*
which
he
warranted
to
be
gentle
and
trained
to
carry
a
lady
--
indeed
,
he
*NL*
had
bought
it
for
his
sister
,
and
was
taking
it
to
Quallingham
.
*NL*
Rosamond
went
out
the
first
time
without
telling
her
husband
,
and
came
*NL*
back
before
his
return
;
but
the
ride
had
been
so
thorough
a
success
,
*NL*
and
she
declared
herself
so
much
the
better
in
consequence
,
that
he
was
*NL*
informed
of
it
with
full
reliance
on
his
consent
that
she
should
go
*NL*
riding
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
contrary
Lydgate
was
more
than
hurt
--
he
was
utterly
confounded
*NL*
that
she
had
risked
herself
on
a
strange
horse
without
referring
the
*NL*
matter
to
his
wish
.
After
the
first
almost
thundering
exclamations
of
*NL*
astonishment
,
which
sufficiently
warned
Rosamond
of
what
was
coming
,
he
*NL*
was
silent
for
some
moments
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
However
,
you
have
come
back
safely
,
''
he
said
,
at
last
,
in
a
decisive
*NL*
tone
.
``
You
will
not
go
again
,
Rosy
;
that
is
understood
.
If
it
were
*NL*
the
quietest
,
most
familiar
horse
in
the
world
,
there
would
always
be
*NL*
the
chance
of
accident
.
And
you
know
very
well
that
I
wished
you
to
*NL*
give
up
riding
the
roan
on
that
account
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
there
is
the
chance
of
accident
indoors

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
darling
,
do
n't
talk
nonsense
,
''
said
Lydgate
,
in
an
imploring
tone
;
*NL*
``
surely
I
am
the
person
to
judge
for
you
.
I
think
it
is
enough
that
I
*NL*
say
you
are
not
to
go
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Rosamond
was
arranging
her
hair
before
dinner
,
and
the
reflection
of
*NL*
her
head
in
the
glass
showed
no
change
in
its
loveliness
except
a
*NL*
little
turning
aside
of
the
long
neck
.
Lydgate
had
been
moving
about
*NL*
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
,
and
now
paused
near
her
,
as
if
he
*NL*
awaited
some
assurance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
you
would
fasten
up
my
plaits
,
dear
,
''
said
Rosamond
,
letting
*NL*
her
arms
fall
with
a
little
sigh
,
so
as
to
make
a
husband
ashamed
of
*NL*
standing
there
like
a
brute
.
Lydgate
had
often
fastened
the
plaits
*NL*
before
,
being
among
the
deftest
of
men
with
his
large
finely
formed
*NL*
fingers
.
He
swept
up
the
soft
festoons
of
plaits
and
fastened
in
the
*NL*
tall
comb
-LRB-
to
such
uses
do
men
come
!
-RRB-
;
and
what
could
he
do
then
but
*NL*
kiss
the
exquisite
nape
which
was
shown
in
all
its
delicate
curves
?
*NL*
But
when
we
do
what
we
have
done
before
,
it
is
often
with
a
difference
.
*NL*
Lydgate
was
still
angry
,
and
had
not
forgotten
his
point
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
tell
the
Captain
that
he
ought
to
have
known
better
than
offer
*NL*
you
his
horse
,
''
he
said
,
as
he
moved
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beg
you
will
not
do
anything
of
the
kind
,
Tertius
,
''
said
Rosamond
,
*NL*
looking
at
him
with
something
more
marked
than
usual
in
her
speech
.
*NL*
``
It
will
be
treating
me
as
if
I
were
a
child
.
Promise
that
you
will
*NL*
leave
the
subject
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
did
seem
to
be
some
truth
in
her
objection
.
Lydgate
said
,
``
Very
*NL*
well
,
''
with
a
surly
obedience
,
and
thus
the
discussion
ended
with
his
*NL*
promising
Rosamond
,
and
not
with
her
promising
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
fact
,
she
had
been
determined
not
to
promise
.
Rosamond
had
that
*NL*
victorious
obstinacy
which
never
wastes
its
energy
in
impetuous
*NL*
resistance
.
What
she
liked
to
do
was
to
her
the
right
thing
,
and
all
*NL*
her
cleverness
was
directed
to
getting
the
means
of
doing
it
.
She
*NL*
meant
to
go
out
riding
again
on
the
gray
,
and
she
did
go
on
the
next
*NL*
opportunity
of
her
husband
's
absence
,
not
intending
that
he
should
know
*NL*
until
it
was
late
enough
not
to
signify
to
her
.
The
temptation
was
*NL*
certainly
great
:
she
was
very
fond
of
the
exercise
,
and
the
*NL*
gratification
of
riding
on
a
fine
horse
,
with
Captain
Lydgate
,
Sir
*NL*
Godwin
's
son
,
on
another
fine
horse
by
her
side
,
and
of
being
met
in
*NL*
this
position
by
any
one
but
her
husband
,
was
something
as
good
as
her
*NL*
dreams
before
marriage
:
moreover
she
was
riveting
the
connection
with
*NL*
the
family
at
Quallingham
,
which
must
be
a
wise
thing
to
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
gentle
gray
,
unprepared
for
the
crash
of
a
tree
that
was
being
*NL*
felled
on
the
edge
of
Halsell
wood
,
took
fright
,
and
caused
a
worse
*NL*
fright
to
Rosamond
,
leading
finally
to
the
loss
of
her
baby
.
Lydgate
*NL*
could
not
show
his
anger
towards
her
,
but
he
was
rather
bearish
to
the
*NL*
Captain
,
whose
visit
naturally
soon
came
to
an
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
all
future
conversations
on
the
subject
,
Rosamond
was
mildly
certain
*NL*
that
the
ride
had
made
no
difference
,
and
that
if
she
had
stayed
at
*NL*
home
the
same
symptoms
would
have
come
on
and
would
have
ended
in
the
*NL*
same
way
,
because
she
had
felt
something
like
them
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lydgate
could
only
say
,
``
Poor
,
poor
darling
!
''
--
but
he
secretly
wondered
*NL*
over
the
terrible
tenacity
of
this
mild
creature
.
There
was
gathering
*NL*
within
him
an
amazed
sense
of
his
powerlessness
over
Rosamond
.
His
*NL*
superior
knowledge
and
mental
force
,
instead
of
being
,
as
he
had
*NL*
imagined
,
a
shrine
to
consult
on
all
occasions
,
was
simply
set
aside
on
*NL*
every
practical
question
.
He
had
regarded
Rosamond
's
cleverness
as
*NL*
precisely
of
the
receptive
kind
which
became
a
woman
.
He
was
now
*NL*
beginning
to
find
out
what
that
cleverness
was
--
what
was
the
shape
into
*NL*
which
it
had
run
as
into
a
close
network
aloof
and
independent
.
No
one
*NL*
quicker
than
Rosamond
to
see
causes
and
effects
which
lay
within
the
*NL*
track
of
her
own
tastes
and
interests
:
she
had
seen
clearly
Lydgate
's
*NL*
preeminence
in
Middlemarch
society
,
and
could
go
on
imaginatively
*NL*
tracing
still
more
agreeable
social
effects
when
his
talent
should
have
*NL*
advanced
him
;
but
for
her
,
his
professional
and
scientific
ambition
had
*NL*
no
other
relation
to
these
desirable
effects
than
if
they
had
been
the
*NL*
fortunate
discovery
of
an
ill-smelling
oil
.
And
that
oil
apart
,
with
*NL*
which
she
had
nothing
to
do
,
of
course
she
believed
in
her
own
opinion
*NL*
more
than
she
did
in
his
.
Lydgate
was
astounded
to
find
in
numberless
*NL*
trifling
matters
,
as
well
as
in
this
last
serious
case
of
the
riding
,
*NL*
that
affection
did
not
make
her
compliant
.
He
had
no
doubt
that
the
*NL*
affection
was
there
,
and
had
no
presentiment
that
he
had
done
anything
*NL*
to
repel
it
.
For
his
own
part
he
said
to
himself
that
he
loved
her
as
*NL*
tenderly
as
ever
,
and
could
make
up
his
mind
to
her
negations
;
*NL*
but
--
well
!
Lydgate
was
much
worried
,
and
conscious
of
new
elements
in
*NL*
his
life
as
noxious
to
him
as
an
inlet
of
mud
to
a
creature
that
has
*NL*
been
used
to
breathe
and
bathe
and
dart
after
its
illuminated
prey
in
*NL*
the
clearest
of
waters
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rosamond
was
soon
looking
lovelier
than
ever
at
her
worktable
,
enjoying
*NL*
drives
in
her
father
's
phaeton
and
thinking
it
likely
that
she
might
be
*NL*
invited
to
Quallingham
.
She
knew
that
she
was
a
much
more
exquisite
*NL*
ornament
to
the
drawing-room
there
than
any
daughter
of
the
family
,
and
*NL*
in
reflecting
that
the
gentlemen
were
aware
of
that
,
did
not
perhaps
*NL*
sufficiently
consider
whether
the
ladies
would
be
eager
to
see
*NL*
themselves
surpassed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lydgate
,
relieved
from
anxiety
about
her
,
relapsed
into
what
she
*NL*
inwardly
called
his
moodiness
--
a
name
which
to
her
covered
his
*NL*
thoughtful
preoccupation
with
other
subjects
than
herself
,
as
well
as
*NL*
that
uneasy
look
of
the
brow
and
distaste
for
all
ordinary
things
as
if
*NL*
they
were
mixed
with
bitter
herbs
,
which
really
made
a
sort
of
*NL*
weather-glass
to
his
vexation
and
foreboding
.
These
latter
states
of
*NL*
mind
had
one
cause
amongst
others
,
which
he
had
generously
but
*NL*
mistakenly
avoided
mentioning
to
Rosamond
,
lest
it
should
affect
her
*NL*
health
and
spirits
.
Between
him
and
her
indeed
there
was
that
total
*NL*
missing
of
each
other
's
mental
track
,
which
is
too
evidently
possible
*NL*
even
between
persons
who
are
continually
thinking
of
each
other
.
To
*NL*
Lydgate
it
seemed
that
he
had
been
spending
month
after
month
in
*NL*
sacrificing
more
than
half
of
his
best
intent
and
best
power
to
his
*NL*
tenderness
for
Rosamond
;
bearing
her
little
claims
and
interruptions
*NL*
without
impatience
,
and
,
above
all
,
bearing
without
betrayal
of
*NL*
bitterness
to
look
through
less
and
less
of
interfering
illusion
at
the
*NL*
blank
unreflecting
surface
her
mind
presented
to
his
ardor
for
the
more
*NL*
impersonal
ends
of
his
profession
and
his
scientific
study
,
an
ardor
*NL*
which
he
had
fancied
that
the
ideal
wife
must
somehow
worship
as
*NL*
sublime
,
though
not
in
the
least
knowing
why
.
But
his
endurance
was
*NL*
mingled
with
a
self-discontent
which
,
if
we
know
how
to
be
candid
,
we
*NL*
shall
confess
to
make
more
than
half
our
bitterness
under
grievances
,
*NL*
wife
or
husband
included
.
It
always
remains
true
that
if
we
had
been
*NL*
greater
,
circumstance
would
have
been
less
strong
against
us
.
Lydgate
*NL*
was
aware
that
his
concessions
to
Rosamond
were
often
little
more
than
*NL*
the
lapse
of
slackening
resolution
,
the
creeping
paralysis
apt
to
seize
*NL*
an
enthusiasm
which
is
out
of
adjustment
to
a
constant
portion
of
our
*NL*
lives
.
And
on
Lydgate
's
enthusiasm
there
was
constantly
pressing
not
a
*NL*
simple
weight
of
sorrow
,
but
the
biting
presence
of
a
petty
degrading
*NL*
care
,
such
as
casts
the
blight
of
irony
over
all
higher
effort
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
care
which
he
had
hitherto
abstained
from
mentioning
to
*NL*
Rosamond
;
and
he
believed
,
with
some
wonder
,
that
it
had
never
entered
*NL*
her
mind
,
though
certainly
no
difficulty
could
be
less
mysterious
.
It
*NL*
was
an
inference
with
a
conspicuous
handle
to
it
,
and
had
been
easily
*NL*
drawn
by
indifferent
observers
,
that
Lydgate
was
in
debt
;
and
he
could
*NL*
not
succeed
in
keeping
out
of
his
mind
for
long
together
that
he
was
*NL*
every
day
getting
deeper
into
that
swamp
,
which
tempts
men
towards
it
*NL*
with
such
a
pretty
covering
of
flowers
and
verdure
.
It
is
wonderful
*NL*
how
soon
a
man
gets
up
to
his
chin
there
--
in
a
condition
in
which
,
*NL*
in
spite
of
himself
,
he
is
forced
to
think
chiefly
of
release
,
though
he
*NL*
had
a
scheme
of
the
universe
in
his
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
Eighteen
months
ago
Lydgate
was
poor
,
but
had
never
known
the
eager
*NL*
want
of
small
sums
,
and
felt
rather
a
burning
contempt
for
any
one
who
*NL*
descended
a
step
in
order
to
gain
them
.
He
was
now
experiencing
*NL*
something
worse
than
a
simple
deficit
:
he
was
assailed
by
the
vulgar
*NL*
hateful
trials
of
a
man
who
has
bought
and
used
a
great
many
things
*NL*
which
might
have
been
done
without
,
and
which
he
is
unable
to
pay
for
,
*NL*
though
the
demand
for
payment
has
become
pressing
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
this
came
about
may
be
easily
seen
without
much
arithmetic
or
*NL*
knowledge
of
prices
.
When
a
man
in
setting
up
a
house
and
preparing
*NL*
for
marriage
finds
that
his
furniture
and
other
initial
expenses
come
*NL*
to
between
four
and
five
hundred
pounds
more
than
he
has
capital
to
pay
*NL*
for
;
when
at
the
end
of
a
year
it
appears
that
his
household
expenses
,
*NL*
horses
and
et
caeteras
,
amount
to
nearly
a
thousand
,
while
the
proceeds
*NL*
of
the
practice
reckoned
from
the
old
books
to
be
worth
eight
hundred
*NL*
per
annum
have
sunk
like
a
summer
pond
and
make
hardly
five
hundred
,
*NL*
chiefly
in
unpaid
entries
,
the
plain
inference
is
that
,
whether
he
*NL*
minds
it
or
not
,
he
is
in
debt
.
Those
were
less
expensive
times
than
*NL*
our
own
,
and
provincial
life
was
comparatively
modest
;
but
the
ease
*NL*
with
which
a
medical
man
who
had
lately
bought
a
practice
,
who
thought
*NL*
that
he
was
obliged
to
keep
two
horses
,
whose
table
was
supplied
*NL*
without
stint
,
and
who
paid
an
insurance
on
his
life
and
a
high
rent
*NL*
for
house
and
garden
,
might
find
his
expenses
doubling
his
receipts
,
*NL*
can
be
conceived
by
any
one
who
does
not
think
these
details
beneath
*NL*
his
consideration
.
Rosamond
,
accustomed
from
her
childhood
to
an
extravagant
*NL*
household
,
thought
that
good
housekeeping
consisted
simply
in
ordering
*NL*
the
best
of
everything
--
nothing
else
``
answered
;
''
and
Lydgate
supposed
*NL*
that
``
if
things
were
done
at
all
,
they
must
be
done
properly
''
--
he
did
*NL*
not
see
how
they
were
to
live
otherwise
.
If
each
head
of
household
*NL*
expenditure
had
been
mentioned
to
him
beforehand
,
he
would
have
*NL*
probably
observed
that
``
it
could
hardly
come
to
much
,
''
and
if
any
one
*NL*
had
suggested
a
saving
on
a
particular
article
--
for
example
,
the
*NL*
substitution
of
cheap
fish
for
dear
--
it
would
have
appeared
to
him
*NL*
simply
a
penny-wise
,
mean
notion
.
Rosamond
,
even
without
such
an
*NL*
occasion
as
Captain
Lydgate
's
visit
,
was
fond
of
giving
invitations
,
*NL*
and
Lydgate
,
though
he
often
thought
the
guests
tiresome
,
did
not
*NL*
interfere
.
This
sociability
seemed
a
necessary
part
of
professional
*NL*
prudence
,
and
the
entertainment
must
be
suitable
.
It
is
true
Lydgate
*NL*
was
constantly
visiting
the
homes
of
the
poor
and
adjusting
his
*NL*
prescriptions
of
diet
to
their
small
means
;
but
,
dear
me
!
has
it
not
by
*NL*
this
time
ceased
to
be
remarkable
--
is
it
not
rather
that
we
expect
in
*NL*
men
,
that
they
should
have
numerous
strands
of
experience
lying
side
by
*NL*
side
and
never
compare
them
with
each
other
?
Expenditure
--
like
*NL*
ugliness
and
errors
--
becomes
a
totally
new
thing
when
we
attach
our
own
*NL*
personality
to
it
,
and
measure
it
by
that
wide
difference
which
is
*NL*
manifest
-LRB-
in
our
own
sensations
-RRB-
between
ourselves
and
others
.
Lydgate
*NL*
believed
himself
to
be
careless
about
his
dress
,
and
he
despised
a
man
*NL*
who
calculated
the
effects
of
his
costume
;
it
seemed
to
him
only
a
*NL*
matter
of
course
that
he
had
abundance
of
fresh
garments
--
such
things
*NL*
were
naturally
ordered
in
sheaves
.
It
must
be
remembered
that
he
had
*NL*
never
hitherto
felt
the
check
of
importunate
debt
,
and
he
walked
by
*NL*
habit
,
not
by
self-criticism
.
But
the
check
had
come
.
*NL*
*NL*
Its
novelty
made
it
the
more
irritating
.
He
was
amazed
,
disgusted
that
*NL*
conditions
so
foreign
to
all
his
purposes
,
so
hatefully
disconnected
*NL*
with
the
objects
he
cared
to
occupy
himself
with
,
should
have
lain
in
*NL*
ambush
and
clutched
him
when
he
was
unaware
.
And
there
was
not
only
*NL*
the
actual
debt
;
there
was
the
certainty
that
in
his
present
position
*NL*
he
must
go
on
deepening
it
.
Two
furnishing
tradesmen
at
Brassing
,
*NL*
whose
bills
had
been
incurred
before
his
marriage
,
and
whom
*NL*
uncalculated
current
expenses
had
ever
since
prevented
him
from
paying
,
*NL*
had
repeatedly
sent
him
unpleasant
letters
which
had
forced
themselves
*NL*
on
his
attention
.
This
could
hardly
have
been
more
galling
to
any
*NL*
disposition
than
to
Lydgate
's
,
with
his
intense
pride
--
his
dislike
of
*NL*
asking
a
favor
or
being
under
an
obligation
to
any
one
.
He
had
scorned
*NL*
even
to
form
conjectures
about
Mr.
Vincy
's
intentions
on
money
matters
,
*NL*
and
nothing
but
extremity
could
have
induced
him
to
apply
to
his
*NL*
father-in-law
,
even
if
he
had
not
been
made
aware
in
various
indirect
*NL*
ways
since
his
marriage
that
Mr.
Vincy
's
own
affairs
were
not
*NL*
flourishing
,
and
that
the
expectation
of
help
from
him
would
be
*NL*
resented
.
Some
men
easily
trust
in
the
readiness
of
friends
;
it
had
*NL*
never
in
the
former
part
of
his
life
occurred
to
Lydgate
that
he
should
*NL*
need
to
do
so
:
he
had
never
thought
what
borrowing
would
be
to
him
;
but
*NL*
now
that
the
idea
had
entered
his
mind
,
he
felt
that
he
would
rather
*NL*
incur
any
other
hardship
.
In
the
mean
time
he
had
no
money
or
*NL*
prospects
of
money
;
and
his
practice
was
not
getting
more
lucrative
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
wonder
that
Lydgate
had
been
unable
to
suppress
all
signs
of
inward
*NL*
trouble
during
the
last
few
months
,
and
now
that
Rosamond
was
regaining
*NL*
brilliant
health
,
he
meditated
taking
her
entirely
into
confidence
on
*NL*
his
difficulties
.
New
conversance
with
tradesmen
's
bills
had
forced
*NL*
his
reasoning
into
a
new
channel
of
comparison
:
he
had
begun
to
*NL*
consider
from
a
new
point
of
view
what
was
necessary
and
unnecessary
in
*NL*
goods
ordered
,
and
to
see
that
there
must
be
some
change
of
habits
.
*NL*
How
could
such
a
change
be
made
without
Rosamond
's
concurrence
?
The
*NL*
immediate
occasion
of
opening
the
disagreeable
fact
to
her
was
forced
*NL*
upon
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
no
money
,
and
having
privately
sought
advice
as
to
what
security
*NL*
could
possibly
be
given
by
a
man
in
his
position
,
Lydgate
had
offered
*NL*
the
one
good
security
in
his
power
to
the
less
peremptory
creditor
,
who
*NL*
was
a
silversmith
and
jeweller
,
and
who
consented
to
take
on
himself
*NL*
the
upholsterer
's
credit
also
,
accepting
interest
for
a
given
term
.
*NL*
The
security
necessary
was
a
bill
of
sale
on
the
furniture
of
his
*NL*
house
,
which
might
make
a
creditor
easy
for
a
reasonable
time
about
a
*NL*
debt
amounting
to
less
than
four
hundred
pounds
;
and
the
silversmith
,
*NL*
Mr.
Dover
,
was
willing
to
reduce
it
by
taking
back
a
portion
of
the
*NL*
plate
and
any
other
article
which
was
as
good
as
new
.
``
Any
other
*NL*
article
''
was
a
phrase
delicately
implying
jewellery
,
and
more
*NL*
particularly
some
purple
amethysts
costing
thirty
pounds
,
which
Lydgate
*NL*
had
bought
as
a
bridal
present
.
*NL*
*NL*
Opinions
may
be
divided
as
to
his
wisdom
in
making
this
present
:
some
*NL*
may
think
that
it
was
a
graceful
attention
to
be
expected
from
a
man
*NL*
like
Lydgate
,
and
that
the
fault
of
any
troublesome
consequences
lay
in
*NL*
the
pinched
narrowness
of
provincial
life
at
that
time
,
which
offered
*NL*
no
conveniences
for
professional
people
whose
fortune
was
not
*NL*
proportioned
to
their
tastes
;
also
,
in
Lydgate
's
ridiculous
*NL*
fastidiousness
about
asking
his
friends
for
money
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
it
had
seemed
a
question
of
no
moment
to
him
on
that
fine
*NL*
morning
when
he
went
to
give
a
final
order
for
plate
:
in
the
presence
*NL*
of
other
jewels
enormously
expensive
,
and
as
an
addition
to
orders
of
*NL*
which
the
amount
had
not
been
exactly
calculated
,
thirty
pounds
for
*NL*
ornaments
so
exquisitely
suited
to
Rosamond
's
neck
and
arms
could
*NL*
hardly
appear
excessive
when
there
was
no
ready
cash
for
it
to
exceed
.
*NL*
But
at
this
crisis
Lydgate
's
imagination
could
not
help
dwelling
on
the
*NL*
possibility
of
letting
the
amethysts
take
their
place
again
among
Mr.
*NL*
Dover
's
stock
,
though
he
shrank
from
the
idea
of
proposing
this
to
*NL*
Rosamond
.
Having
been
roused
to
discern
consequences
which
he
had
*NL*
never
been
in
the
habit
of
tracing
,
he
was
preparing
to
act
on
this
*NL*
discernment
with
some
of
the
rigor
-LRB-
by
no
means
all
-RRB-
that
he
would
have
*NL*
applied
in
pursuing
experiment
.
He
was
nerving
himself
to
this
rigor
*NL*
as
he
rode
from
Brassing
,
and
meditated
on
the
representations
he
must
*NL*
make
to
Rosamond
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
evening
when
he
got
home
.
He
was
intensely
miserable
,
this
*NL*
strong
man
of
nine-and-twenty
and
of
many
gifts
.
He
was
not
saying
*NL*
angrily
within
himself
that
he
had
made
a
profound
mistake
;
but
the
*NL*
mistake
was
at
work
in
him
like
a
recognized
chronic
disease
,
mingling
*NL*
its
uneasy
importunities
with
every
prospect
,
and
enfeebling
every
*NL*
thought
.
As
he
went
along
the
passage
to
the
drawing-room
,
he
heard
*NL*
the
piano
and
singing
.
Of
course
,
Ladislaw
was
there
.
It
was
some
*NL*
weeks
since
Will
had
parted
from
Dorothea
,
yet
he
was
still
at
the
old
*NL*
post
in
Middlemarch
.
Lydgate
had
no
objection
in
general
to
Ladislaw
's
*NL*
coming
,
but
just
now
he
was
annoyed
that
he
could
not
find
his
hearth
*NL*
free
.
When
he
opened
the
door
the
two
singers
went
on
towards
the
*NL*
key-note
,
raising
their
eyes
and
looking
at
him
indeed
,
but
not
*NL*
regarding
his
entrance
as
an
interruption
.
To
a
man
galled
with
his
*NL*
harness
as
poor
Lydgate
was
,
it
is
not
soothing
to
see
two
people
*NL*
warbling
at
him
,
as
he
comes
in
with
the
sense
that
the
painful
day
has
*NL*
still
pains
in
store
.
His
face
,
already
paler
than
usual
,
took
on
a
*NL*
scowl
as
he
walked
across
the
room
and
flung
himself
into
a
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
singers
feeling
themselves
excused
by
the
fact
that
they
had
only
*NL*
three
bars
to
sing
,
now
turned
round
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
are
you
,
Lydgate
?
''
said
Will
,
coming
forward
to
shake
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lydgate
took
his
hand
,
but
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
dined
,
Tertius
?
I
expected
you
much
earlier
,
''
said
Rosamond
,
*NL*
who
had
already
seen
that
her
husband
was
in
a
``
horrible
humor
.
''
She
*NL*
seated
herself
in
her
usual
place
as
she
spoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
dined
.
I
should
like
some
tea
,
please
,
''
said
Lydgate
,
curtly
,
*NL*
still
scowling
and
looking
markedly
at
his
legs
stretched
out
before
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Will
was
too
quick
to
need
more
.
``
I
shall
be
off
,
''
he
said
,
reaching
*NL*
his
hat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tea
is
coming
,
''
said
Rosamond
;
``
pray
do
n't
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Lydgate
is
bored
,
''
said
Will
,
who
had
more
comprehension
of
*NL*
Lydgate
than
Rosamond
had
,
and
was
not
offended
by
his
manner
,
easily
*NL*
imagining
outdoor
causes
of
annoyance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
the
more
need
for
you
to
stay
,
''
said
Rosamond
,
playfully
,
and
*NL*
in
her
lightest
accent
;
``
he
will
not
speak
to
me
all
the
evening
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Rosamond
,
I
shall
,
''
said
Lydgate
,
in
his
strong
baritone
.
``
I
*NL*
have
some
serious
business
to
speak
to
you
about
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
No
introduction
of
the
business
could
have
been
less
like
that
which
*NL*
Lydgate
had
intended
;
but
her
indifferent
manner
had
been
too
provoking
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
!
you
see
,
''
said
Will
.
``
I
'm
going
to
the
meeting
about
the
*NL*
Mechanics
'
Institute
.
Good-by
;
''
and
he
went
quickly
out
of
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rosamond
did
not
look
at
her
husband
,
but
presently
rose
and
took
her
*NL*
place
before
the
tea-tray
.
She
was
thinking
that
she
had
never
seen
him
*NL*
so
disagreeable
.
Lydgate
turned
his
dark
eyes
on
her
and
watched
her
*NL*
as
she
delicately
handled
the
tea-service
with
her
taper
fingers
,
and
*NL*
looked
at
the
objects
immediately
before
her
with
no
curve
in
her
face
*NL*
disturbed
,
and
yet
with
an
ineffable
protest
in
her
air
against
all
*NL*
people
with
unpleasant
manners
.
For
the
moment
he
lost
the
sense
of
*NL*
his
wound
in
a
sudden
speculation
about
this
new
form
of
feminine
*NL*
impassibility
revealing
itself
in
the
sylph-like
frame
which
he
had
*NL*
once
interpreted
as
the
sign
of
a
ready
intelligent
sensitiveness
.
His
*NL*
mind
glancing
back
to
Laure
while
he
looked
at
Rosamond
,
he
said
*NL*
inwardly
,
``
Would
_
she
_
kill
me
because
I
wearied
her
?
''
and
then
,
``
It
is
*NL*
the
way
with
all
women
.
''
But
this
power
of
generalizing
which
gives
men
*NL*
so
much
the
superiority
in
mistake
over
the
dumb
animals
,
was
*NL*
immediately
thwarted
by
Lydgate
's
memory
of
wondering
impressions
from
*NL*
the
behavior
of
another
woman
--
from
Dorothea
's
looks
and
tones
of
*NL*
emotion
about
her
husband
when
Lydgate
began
to
attend
him
--
from
her
*NL*
passionate
cry
to
be
taught
what
would
best
comfort
that
man
for
whose
*NL*
sake
it
seemed
as
if
she
must
quell
every
impulse
in
her
except
the
*NL*
yearnings
of
faithfulness
and
compassion
.
These
revived
impressions
*NL*
succeeded
each
other
quickly
and
dreamily
in
Lydgate
's
mind
while
the
*NL*
tea
was
being
brewed
.
He
had
shut
his
eyes
in
the
last
instant
of
*NL*
reverie
while
he
heard
Dorothea
saying
,
``
Advise
me
--
think
what
I
can
*NL*
do
--
he
has
been
all
his
life
laboring
and
looking
forward
.
He
minds
*NL*
about
nothing
else
--
and
I
mind
about
nothing
else
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
voice
of
deep-souled
womanhood
had
remained
within
him
as
the
*NL*
enkindling
conceptions
of
dead
and
sceptred
genius
had
remained
within
*NL*
him
-LRB-
is
there
not
a
genius
for
feeling
nobly
which
also
reigns
over
*NL*
human
spirits
and
their
conclusions
?
-RRB-
;
the
tones
were
a
music
from
*NL*
which
he
was
falling
away
--
he
had
really
fallen
into
a
momentary
doze
,
*NL*
when
Rosamond
said
in
her
silvery
neutral
way
,
``
Here
is
your
tea
,
*NL*
Tertius
,
''
setting
it
on
the
small
table
by
his
side
,
and
then
moved
*NL*
back
to
her
place
without
looking
at
him
.
Lydgate
was
too
hasty
in
*NL*
attributing
insensibility
to
her
;
after
her
own
fashion
,
she
was
*NL*
sensitive
enough
,
and
took
lasting
impressions
.
Her
impression
now
was
*NL*
one
of
offence
and
repulsion
.
But
then
,
Rosamond
had
no
scowls
and
had
*NL*
never
raised
her
voice
:
she
was
quite
sure
that
no
one
could
justly
*NL*
find
fault
with
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Perhaps
Lydgate
and
she
had
never
felt
so
far
off
each
other
before
;
*NL*
but
there
were
strong
reasons
for
not
deferring
his
revelation
,
even
if
*NL*
he
had
not
already
begun
it
by
that
abrupt
announcement
;
indeed
some
of
*NL*
the
angry
desire
to
rouse
her
into
more
sensibility
on
his
account
*NL*
which
had
prompted
him
to
speak
prematurely
,
still
mingled
with
his
*NL*
pain
in
the
prospect
of
her
pain
.
But
he
waited
till
the
tray
was
*NL*
gone
,
the
candles
were
lit
,
and
the
evening
quiet
might
be
counted
on
:
*NL*
the
interval
had
left
time
for
repelled
tenderness
to
return
into
the
*NL*
old
course
.
He
spoke
kindly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
Rosy
,
lay
down
your
work
and
come
to
sit
by
me
,
''
he
said
,
gently
,
*NL*
pushing
away
the
table
,
and
stretching
out
his
arm
to
draw
a
chair
near
*NL*
his
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rosamond
obeyed
.
As
she
came
towards
him
in
her
drapery
of
transparent
*NL*
faintly
tinted
muslin
,
her
slim
yet
round
figure
never
looked
more
*NL*
graceful
;
as
she
sat
down
by
him
and
laid
one
hand
on
the
elbow
of
his
*NL*
chair
,
at
last
looking
at
him
and
meeting
his
eyes
,
her
delicate
neck
*NL*
and
cheek
and
purely
cut
lips
never
had
more
of
that
untarnished
beauty
*NL*
which
touches
as
in
spring-time
and
infancy
and
all
sweet
freshness
.
*NL*
It
touched
Lydgate
now
,
and
mingled
the
early
moments
of
his
love
for
*NL*
her
with
all
the
other
memories
which
were
stirred
in
this
crisis
of
*NL*
deep
trouble
.
He
laid
his
ample
hand
softly
on
hers
,
saying
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
!
''
with
the
lingering
utterance
which
affection
gives
to
the
word
.
*NL*
Rosamond
too
was
still
under
the
power
of
that
same
past
,
and
her
*NL*
husband
was
still
in
part
the
Lydgate
whose
approval
had
stirred
*NL*
delight
.
She
put
his
hair
lightly
away
from
his
forehead
,
then
laid
*NL*
her
other
hand
on
his
,
and
was
conscious
of
forgiving
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
obliged
to
tell
you
what
will
hurt
you
,
Rosy
.
But
there
are
*NL*
things
which
husband
and
wife
must
think
of
together
.
I
dare
say
it
*NL*
has
occurred
to
you
already
that
I
am
short
of
money
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lydgate
paused
;
but
Rosamond
turned
her
neck
and
looked
at
a
vase
on
*NL*
the
mantel-piece
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
not
able
to
pay
for
all
the
things
we
had
to
get
before
we
were
*NL*
married
,
and
there
have
been
expenses
since
which
I
have
been
obliged
*NL*
to
meet
.
The
consequence
is
,
there
is
a
large
debt
at
Brassing
--
three
*NL*
hundred
and
eighty
pounds
--
which
has
been
pressing
on
me
a
good
while
,
*NL*
and
in
fact
we
are
getting
deeper
every
day
,
for
people
do
n't
pay
me
*NL*
the
faster
because
others
want
the
money
.
I
took
pains
to
keep
it
from
*NL*
you
while
you
were
not
well
;
but
now
we
must
think
together
about
it
,
*NL*
and
you
must
help
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
can
--
I
--
do
,
Tertius
?
''
said
Rosamond
,
turning
her
eyes
on
him
*NL*
again
.
That
little
speech
of
four
words
,
like
so
many
others
in
all
*NL*
languages
,
is
capable
by
varied
vocal
inflections
of
expressing
all
*NL*
states
of
mind
from
helpless
dimness
to
exhaustive
argumentative
*NL*
perception
,
from
the
completest
self-devoting
fellowship
to
the
most
*NL*
neutral
aloofness
.
Rosamond
's
thin
utterance
threw
into
the
words
*NL*
``
What
can
--
I
--
do
!
''
as
much
neutrality
as
they
could
hold
.
They
fell
*NL*
like
a
mortal
chill
on
Lydgate
's
roused
tenderness
.
He
did
not
storm
*NL*
in
indignation
--
he
felt
too
sad
a
sinking
of
the
heart
.
And
when
he
*NL*
spoke
again
it
was
more
in
the
tone
of
a
man
who
forces
himself
to
*NL*
fulfil
a
task
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
necessary
for
you
to
know
,
because
I
have
to
give
security
for
a
*NL*
time
,
and
a
man
must
come
to
make
an
inventory
of
the
furniture
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Rosamond
colored
deeply
.
``
Have
you
not
asked
papa
for
money
?
''
she
*NL*
said
,
as
soon
as
she
could
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
must
ask
him
!
''
she
said
,
releasing
her
hands
from
Lydgate
's
,
*NL*
and
rising
to
stand
at
two
yards
'
distance
from
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Rosy
,
''
said
Lydgate
,
decisively
.
``
It
is
too
late
to
do
that
.
The
*NL*
inventory
will
be
begun
to-morrow
.
Remember
it
is
a
mere
security
:
it
*NL*
will
make
no
difference
:
it
is
a
temporary
affair
.
I
insist
upon
it
*NL*
that
your
father
shall
not
know
,
unless
I
choose
to
tell
him
,
''
added
*NL*
Lydgate
,
with
a
more
peremptory
emphasis
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
certainly
was
unkind
,
but
Rosamond
had
thrown
him
back
on
evil
*NL*
expectation
as
to
what
she
would
do
in
the
way
of
quiet
steady
*NL*
disobedience
.
The
unkindness
seemed
unpardonable
to
her
:
she
was
not
*NL*
given
to
weeping
and
disliked
it
,
but
now
her
chin
and
lips
began
to
*NL*
tremble
and
the
tears
welled
up
.
Perhaps
it
was
not
possible
for
*NL*
Lydgate
,
under
the
double
stress
of
outward
material
difficulty
and
of
*NL*
his
own
proud
resistance
to
humiliating
consequences
,
to
imagine
fully
*NL*
what
this
sudden
trial
was
to
a
young
creature
who
had
known
nothing
*NL*
but
indulgence
,
and
whose
dreams
had
all
been
of
new
indulgence
,
more
*NL*
exactly
to
her
taste
.
But
he
did
wish
to
spare
her
as
much
as
he
*NL*
could
,
and
her
tears
cut
him
to
the
heart
.
He
could
not
speak
again
*NL*
immediately
;
but
Rosamond
did
not
go
on
sobbing
:
she
tried
to
conquer
*NL*
her
agitation
and
wiped
away
her
tears
,
continuing
to
look
before
her
*NL*
at
the
mantel-piece
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Try
not
to
grieve
,
darling
,
''
said
Lydgate
,
turning
his
eyes
up
towards
*NL*
her
.
That
she
had
chosen
to
move
away
from
him
in
this
moment
of
her
*NL*
trouble
made
everything
harder
to
say
,
but
he
must
absolutely
go
on
.
*NL*
``
We
must
brace
ourselves
to
do
what
is
necessary
.
It
is
I
who
have
*NL*
been
in
fault
:
I
ought
to
have
seen
that
I
could
not
afford
to
live
in
*NL*
this
way
.
But
many
things
have
told
against
me
in
my
practice
,
and
it
*NL*
really
just
now
has
ebbed
to
a
low
point
.
I
may
recover
it
,
but
in
the
*NL*
mean
time
we
must
pull
up
--
we
must
change
our
way
of
living
.
We
shall
*NL*
weather
it
.
When
I
have
given
this
security
I
shall
have
time
to
look
*NL*
about
me
;
and
you
are
so
clever
that
if
you
turn
your
mind
to
managing
*NL*
you
will
school
me
into
carefulness
.
I
have
been
a
thoughtless
rascal
*NL*
about
squaring
prices
--
but
come
,
dear
,
sit
down
and
forgive
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lydgate
was
bowing
his
neck
under
the
yoke
like
a
creature
who
had
*NL*
talons
,
but
who
had
Reason
too
,
which
often
reduces
us
to
meekness
.
*NL*
When
he
had
spoken
the
last
words
in
an
imploring
tone
,
Rosamond
*NL*
returned
to
the
chair
by
his
side
.
His
self-blame
gave
her
some
hope
*NL*
that
he
would
attend
to
her
opinion
,
and
she
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
can
you
not
put
off
having
the
inventory
made
?
You
can
send
the
*NL*
men
away
to-morrow
when
they
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
not
send
them
away
,
''
said
Lydgate
,
the
peremptoriness
rising
*NL*
again
.
Was
it
of
any
use
to
explain
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
we
left
Middlemarch
?
there
would
of
course
be
a
sale
,
and
that
*NL*
would
do
as
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
we
are
not
going
to
leave
Middlemarch
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sure
,
Tertius
,
it
would
be
much
better
to
do
so
.
Why
can
we
not
*NL*
go
to
London
?
Or
near
Durham
,
where
your
family
is
known
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
can
go
nowhere
without
money
,
Rosamond
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
friends
would
not
wish
you
to
be
without
money
.
And
surely
these
*NL*
odious
tradesmen
might
be
made
to
understand
that
,
and
to
wait
,
if
you
*NL*
would
make
proper
representations
to
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
idle
Rosamond
,
''
said
Lydgate
,
angrily
.
``
You
must
learn
to
*NL*
take
my
judgment
on
questions
you
do
n't
understand
.
I
have
made
*NL*
necessary
arrangements
,
and
they
must
be
carried
out
.
As
to
friends
,
I
*NL*
have
no
expectations
whatever
from
them
,
and
shall
not
ask
them
for
*NL*
anything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Rosamond
sat
perfectly
still
.
The
thought
in
her
mind
was
that
if
she
*NL*
had
known
how
Lydgate
would
behave
,
she
would
never
have
married
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
no
time
to
waste
now
on
unnecessary
words
,
dear
,
''
said
*NL*
Lydgate
,
trying
to
be
gentle
again
.
``
There
are
some
details
that
I
*NL*
want
to
consider
with
you
.
Dover
says
he
will
take
a
good
deal
of
the
*NL*
plate
back
again
,
and
any
of
the
jewellery
we
like
.
He
really
behaves
*NL*
very
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
we
to
go
without
spoons
and
forks
then
?
''
said
Rosamond
,
whose
very
*NL*
lips
seemed
to
get
thinner
with
the
thinness
of
her
utterance
.
She
was
*NL*
determined
to
make
no
further
resistance
or
suggestions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
,
dear
!
''
said
Lydgate
.
``
But
look
here
,
''
he
continued
,
drawing
a
*NL*
paper
from
his
pocket
and
opening
it
;
``
here
is
Dover
's
account
.
See
,
I
*NL*
have
marked
a
number
of
articles
,
which
if
we
returned
them
would
*NL*
reduce
the
amount
by
thirty
pounds
and
more
.
I
have
not
marked
any
*NL*
of
the
jewellery
.
''
Lydgate
had
really
felt
this
point
of
the
jewellery
*NL*
very
bitter
to
himself
;
but
he
had
overcome
the
feeling
by
severe
*NL*
argument
.
He
could
not
propose
to
Rosamond
that
she
should
return
any
*NL*
particular
present
of
his
,
but
he
had
told
himself
that
he
was
bound
to
*NL*
put
Dover
's
offer
before
her
,
and
her
inward
prompting
might
make
the
*NL*
affair
easy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
useless
for
me
to
look
,
Tertius
,
''
said
Rosamond
,
calmly
;
``
you
*NL*
will
return
what
you
please
.
''
She
would
not
turn
her
eyes
on
the
*NL*
paper
,
and
Lydgate
,
flushing
up
to
the
roots
of
his
hair
,
drew
it
back
*NL*
and
let
it
fall
on
his
knee
.
Meanwhile
Rosamond
quietly
went
out
of
*NL*
the
room
,
leaving
Lydgate
helpless
and
wondering
.
Was
she
not
coming
*NL*
back
?
It
seemed
that
she
had
no
more
identified
herself
with
him
than
*NL*
if
they
had
been
creatures
of
different
species
and
opposing
interests
.
*NL*
He
tossed
his
head
and
thrust
his
hands
deep
into
his
pockets
with
a
*NL*
sort
of
vengeance
.
There
was
still
science
--
there
were
still
good
*NL*
objects
to
work
for
.
He
must
give
a
tug
still
--
all
the
stronger
*NL*
because
other
satisfactions
were
going
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
door
opened
and
Rosamond
re-entered
.
She
carried
the
leather
*NL*
box
containing
the
amethysts
,
and
a
tiny
ornamental
basket
which
*NL*
contained
other
boxes
,
and
laying
them
on
the
chair
where
she
had
been
*NL*
sitting
,
she
said
,
with
perfect
propriety
in
her
air
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
all
the
jewellery
you
ever
gave
me
.
You
can
return
what
you
*NL*
like
of
it
,
and
of
the
plate
also
.
You
will
not
,
of
course
,
expect
me
*NL*
to
stay
at
home
to-morrow
.
I
shall
go
to
papa
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
many
women
the
look
Lydgate
cast
at
her
would
have
been
more
*NL*
terrible
than
one
of
anger
:
it
had
in
it
a
despairing
acceptance
of
the
*NL*
distance
she
was
placing
between
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
when
shall
you
come
back
again
?
''
he
said
,
with
a
bitter
edge
on
*NL*
his
accent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
in
the
evening
.
Of
course
I
shall
not
mention
the
subject
to
*NL*
mamma
.
''
Rosamond
was
convinced
that
no
woman
could
behave
more
*NL*
irreproachably
than
she
was
behaving
;
and
she
went
to
sit
down
at
her
*NL*
work-table
.
Lydgate
sat
meditating
a
minute
or
two
,
and
the
result
was
*NL*
that
he
said
,
with
some
of
the
old
emotion
in
his
tone
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
we
have
been
united
,
Rosy
,
you
should
not
leave
me
to
myself
in
*NL*
the
first
trouble
that
has
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
not
,
''
said
Rosamond
;
``
I
shall
do
everything
it
becomes
me
to
*NL*
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
not
right
that
the
thing
should
be
left
to
servants
,
or
that
I
*NL*
should
have
to
speak
to
them
about
it
.
And
I
shall
be
obliged
to
go
*NL*
out
--
I
do
n't
know
how
early
.
I
understand
your
shrinking
from
the
*NL*
humiliation
of
these
money
affairs
.
But
,
my
dear
Rosamond
,
as
a
*NL*
question
of
pride
,
which
I
feel
just
as
much
as
you
can
,
it
is
surely
*NL*
better
to
manage
the
thing
ourselves
,
and
let
the
servants
see
as
*NL*
little
of
it
as
possible
;
and
since
you
are
my
wife
,
there
is
no
*NL*
hindering
your
share
in
my
disgraces
--
if
there
were
disgraces
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Rosamond
did
not
answer
immediately
,
but
at
last
she
said
,
``
Very
well
,
*NL*
I
will
stay
at
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
not
touch
these
jewels
,
Rosy
.
Take
them
away
again
.
But
I
*NL*
will
write
out
a
list
of
plate
that
we
may
return
,
and
that
can
be
*NL*
packed
up
and
sent
at
once
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
servants
will
know
_
that
_
,
''
said
Rosamond
,
with
the
slightest
*NL*
touch
of
sarcasm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
we
must
meet
some
disagreeables
as
necessities
.
Where
is
the
*NL*
ink
,
I
wonder
?
''
said
Lydgate
,
rising
,
and
throwing
the
account
on
the
*NL*
larger
table
where
he
meant
to
write
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rosamond
went
to
reach
the
inkstand
,
and
after
setting
it
on
the
table
*NL*
was
going
to
turn
away
,
when
Lydgate
,
who
was
standing
close
by
,
put
*NL*
his
arm
round
her
and
drew
her
towards
him
,
saying
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
darling
,
let
us
make
the
best
of
things
.
It
will
only
be
for
a
*NL*
time
,
I
hope
,
that
we
shall
have
to
be
stingy
and
particular
.
Kiss
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
native
warm-heartedness
took
a
great
deal
of
quenching
,
and
it
is
a
*NL*
part
of
manliness
for
a
husband
to
feel
keenly
the
fact
that
an
*NL*
inexperienced
girl
has
got
into
trouble
by
marrying
him
.
She
received
*NL*
his
kiss
and
returned
it
faintly
,
and
in
this
way
an
appearance
of
*NL*
accord
was
recovered
for
the
time
.
But
Lydgate
could
not
help
looking
*NL*
forward
with
dread
to
the
inevitable
future
discussions
about
*NL*
expenditure
and
the
necessity
for
a
complete
change
in
their
way
of
*NL*
living

*NL*
They
said
of
old
the
Soul
had
human
shape

*NL*
But
smaller
,
subtler
than
the
fleshly

*NL*
So
wandered
forth
for
airing
when
it
pleased
.
*NL*
And
see
!
beside
her
cherub-face
there
floats
*NL*
A
pale-lipped
form
aerial
whispering
*NL*
Its
promptings
in
that
little
shell
her
ear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
News
is
often
dispersed
as
thoughtlessly
and
effectively
as
that
pollen
*NL*
which
the
bees
carry
off
-LRB-
having
no
idea
how
powdery
they
are
-RRB-
when
*NL*
they
are
buzzing
in
search
of
their
particular
nectar
.
This
fine
*NL*
comparison
has
reference
to
Fred
Vincy
,
who
on
that
evening
at
Lowick
*NL*
Parsonage
heard
a
lively
discussion
among
the
ladies
on
the
news
which
*NL*
their
old
servant
had
got
from
Tantripp
concerning
Mr.
Casaubon
's
*NL*
strange
mention
of
Mr.
Ladislaw
in
a
codicil
to
his
will
made
not
long
*NL*
before
his
death
.
Miss
Winifred
was
astounded
to
find
that
her
brother
*NL*
had
known
the
fact
before
,
and
observed
that
Camden
was
the
most
*NL*
wonderful
man
for
knowing
things
and
not
telling
them
;
whereupon
Mary
*NL*
Garth
said
that
the
codicil
had
perhaps
got
mixed
up
with
the
habits
of
*NL*
spiders
,
which
Miss
Winifred
never
would
listen
to
.
Mrs.
Farebrother
*NL*
considered
that
the
news
had
something
to
do
with
their
having
only
*NL*
once
seen
Mr.
Ladislaw
at
Lowick
,
and
Miss
Noble
made
many
small
*NL*
compassionate
mewings
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fred
knew
little
and
cared
less
about
Ladislaw
and
the
Casaubons
,
and
*NL*
his
mind
never
recurred
to
that
discussion
till
one
day
calling
on
*NL*
Rosamond
at
his
mother
's
request
to
deliver
a
message
as
he
passed
,
he
*NL*
happened
to
see
Ladislaw
going
away
.
Fred
and
Rosamond
had
little
to
*NL*
say
to
each
other
now
that
marriage
had
removed
her
from
collision
with
*NL*
the
unpleasantness
of
brothers
,
and
especially
now
that
he
had
taken
*NL*
what
she
held
the
stupid
and
even
reprehensible
step
of
giving
up
the
*NL*
Church
to
take
to
such
a
business
as
Mr.
Garth
's
.
Hence
Fred
talked
by
*NL*
preference
of
what
he
considered
indifferent
news
,
and
``
a
propos
of
*NL*
that
young
Ladislaw
''
mentioned
what
he
had
heard
at
Lowick
Parsonage
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
Lydgate
,
like
Mr.
Farebrother
,
knew
a
great
deal
more
than
he
told
,
*NL*
and
when
he
had
once
been
set
thinking
about
the
relation
between
Will
*NL*
and
Dorothea
his
conjectures
had
gone
beyond
the
fact
.
He
imagined
*NL*
that
there
was
a
passionate
attachment
on
both
sides
,
and
this
struck
*NL*
him
as
much
too
serious
to
gossip
about
.
He
remembered
Will
's
*NL*
irritability
when
he
had
mentioned
Mrs.
Casaubon
,
and
was
the
more
*NL*
circumspect
.
On
the
whole
his
surmises
,
in
addition
to
what
he
knew
of
*NL*
the
fact
,
increased
his
friendliness
and
tolerance
towards
Ladislaw
,
*NL*
and
made
him
understand
the
vacillation
which
kept
him
at
Middlemarch
*NL*
after
he
had
said
that
he
should
go
away
.
It
was
significant
of
the
*NL*
separateness
between
Lydgate
's
mind
and
Rosamond
's
that
he
had
no
*NL*
impulse
to
speak
to
her
on
the
subject
;
indeed
,
he
did
not
quite
trust
*NL*
her
reticence
towards
Will
.
And
he
was
right
there
;
though
he
had
no
*NL*
vision
of
the
way
in
which
her
mind
would
act
in
urging
her
to
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
repeated
Fred
's
news
to
Lydgate
,
he
said
,
``
Take
care
you
do
n't
*NL*
drop
the
faintest
hint
to
Ladislaw
,
Rosy
.
He
is
likely
to
fly
out
as
*NL*
if
you
insulted
him
.
Of
course
it
is
a
painful
affair
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Rosamond
turned
her
neck
and
patted
her
hair
,
looking
the
image
of
*NL*
placid
indifference
.
But
the
next
time
Will
came
when
Lydgate
was
*NL*
away
,
she
spoke
archly
about
his
not
going
to
London
as
he
had
*NL*
threatened
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
all
about
it
.
I
have
a
confidential
little
bird
,
''
said
she
,
*NL*
showing
very
pretty
airs
of
her
head
over
the
bit
of
work
held
high
*NL*
between
her
active
fingers
.
``
There
is
a
powerful
magnet
in
this
*NL*
neighborhood
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
be
sure
there
is
.
Nobody
knows
that
better
than
you
,
''
said
Will
,
*NL*
with
light
gallantry
,
but
inwardly
prepared
to
be
angry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
really
the
most
charming
romance
:
Mr.
Casaubon
jealous
,
and
*NL*
foreseeing
that
there
was
no
one
else
whom
Mrs.
Casaubon
would
so
much
*NL*
like
to
marry
,
and
no
one
who
would
so
much
like
to
marry
her
as
a
*NL*
certain
gentleman
;
and
then
laying
a
plan
to
spoil
all
by
making
her
*NL*
forfeit
her
property
if
she
did
marry
that
gentleman
--
and
then
--
and
*NL*
then
--
and
then
--
oh
,
I
have
no
doubt
the
end
will
be
thoroughly
*NL*
romantic
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Great
God
!
what
do
you
mean
?
''
said
Will
,
flushing
over
face
and
ears
,
*NL*
his
features
seeming
to
change
as
if
he
had
had
a
violent
shake
.
*NL*
``
Do
n't
joke
;
tell
me
what
you
mean
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
really
know
?
''
said
Rosamond
,
no
longer
playful
,
and
desiring
*NL*
nothing
better
than
to
tell
in
order
that
she
might
evoke
effects
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
!
''
he
returned
,
impatiently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
know
that
Mr.
Casaubon
has
left
it
in
his
will
that
if
Mrs.
*NL*
Casaubon
marries
you
she
is
to
forfeit
all
her
property
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
know
that
it
is
true
?
''
said
Will
,
eagerly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
brother
Fred
heard
it
from
the
Farebrothers
.
''
Will
started
up
from
*NL*
his
chair
and
reached
his
hat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
dare
say
she
likes
you
better
than
the
property
,
''
said
Rosamond
,
*NL*
looking
at
him
from
a
distance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pray
do
n't
say
any
more
about
it
,
''
said
Will
,
in
a
hoarse
undertone
*NL*
extremely
unlike
his
usual
light
voice
.
``
It
is
a
foul
insult
to
her
*NL*
and
to
me
.
''
Then
he
sat
down
absently
,
looking
before
him
,
but
seeing
*NL*
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
you
are
angry
with
_
me
_
,
''
said
Rosamond
.
``
It
is
too
bad
to
bear
*NL*
_
me
_
malice
.
You
ought
to
be
obliged
to
me
for
telling
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
I
am
,
''
said
Will
,
abruptly
,
speaking
with
that
kind
of
double
soul
*NL*
which
belongs
to
dreamers
who
answer
questions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
expect
to
hear
of
the
marriage
,
''
said
Rosamond
,
playfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
!
You
will
never
hear
of
the
marriage
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
those
words
uttered
impetuously
,
Will
rose
,
put
out
his
hand
to
*NL*
Rosamond
,
still
with
the
air
of
a
somnambulist
,
and
went
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
was
gone
,
Rosamond
left
her
chair
and
walked
to
the
other
end
*NL*
of
the
room
,
leaning
when
she
got
there
against
a
chiffonniere
,
and
*NL*
looking
out
of
the
window
wearily
.
She
was
oppressed
by
ennui
,
and
by
*NL*
that
dissatisfaction
which
in
women
's
minds
is
continually
turning
into
*NL*
a
trivial
jealousy
,
referring
to
no
real
claims
,
springing
from
no
*NL*
deeper
passion
than
the
vague
exactingness
of
egoism
,
and
yet
capable
*NL*
of
impelling
action
as
well
as
speech
.
``
There
really
is
nothing
to
*NL*
care
for
much
,
''
said
poor
Rosamond
inwardly
,
thinking
of
the
family
at
*NL*
Quallingham
,
who
did
not
write
to
her
;
and
that
perhaps
Tertius
when
he
*NL*
came
home
would
tease
her
about
expenses
.
She
had
already
secretly
*NL*
disobeyed
him
by
asking
her
father
to
help
them
,
and
he
had
ended
*NL*
decisively
by
saying
,
``
I
am
more
likely
to
want
help
myself
.

CHAPTER
LX
.
*NL*
*NL*
Good
phrases
are
surely
,
and
ever
were
,
very
commendable
.
*NL*
--
Justice
Shallow
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
days
afterwards
--
it
was
already
the
end
of
August
--
there
was
an
*NL*
occasion
which
caused
some
excitement
in
Middlemarch
:
the
public
,
if
it
*NL*
chose
,
was
to
have
the
advantage
of
buying
,
under
the
distinguished
*NL*
auspices
of
Mr.
Borthrop
Trumbull
,
the
furniture
,
books
,
and
pictures
*NL*
which
anybody
might
see
by
the
handbills
to
be
the
best
in
every
kind
,
*NL*
belonging
to
Edwin
Larcher
,
Esq.
.
This
was
not
one
of
the
sales
*NL*
indicating
the
depression
of
trade
;
on
the
contrary
,
it
was
due
to
Mr.
*NL*
Larcher
's
great
success
in
the
carrying
business
,
which
warranted
his
*NL*
purchase
of
a
mansion
near
Riverston
already
furnished
in
high
style
by
*NL*
an
illustrious
Spa
physician
--
furnished
indeed
with
such
large
*NL*
framefuls
of
expensive
flesh-painting
in
the
dining-room
,
that
Mrs.
*NL*
Larcher
was
nervous
until
reassured
by
finding
the
subjects
to
be
*NL*
Scriptural
.
Hence
the
fine
opportunity
to
purchasers
which
was
well
*NL*
pointed
out
in
the
handbills
of
Mr.
Borthrop
Trumbull
,
whose
*NL*
acquaintance
with
the
history
of
art
enabled
him
to
state
that
the
hall
*NL*
furniture
,
to
be
sold
without
reserve
,
comprised
a
piece
of
carving
by
*NL*
a
contemporary
of
Gibbons
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
Middlemarch
in
those
times
a
large
sale
was
regarded
as
a
kind
of
*NL*
festival
.
There
was
a
table
spread
with
the
best
cold
eatables
,
as
at
*NL*
a
superior
funeral
;
and
facilities
were
offered
for
that
*NL*
generous-drinking
of
cheerful
glasses
which
might
lead
to
generous
and
*NL*
cheerful
bidding
for
undesirable
articles
.
Mr.
Larcher
's
sale
was
the
*NL*
more
attractive
in
the
fine
weather
because
the
house
stood
just
at
the
*NL*
end
of
the
town
,
with
a
garden
and
stables
attached
,
in
that
pleasant
*NL*
issue
from
Middlemarch
called
the
London
Road
,
which
was
also
the
road
*NL*
to
the
New
Hospital
and
to
Mr.
Bulstrode
's
retired
residence
,
known
as
*NL*
the
Shrubs
.
In
short
,
the
auction
was
as
good
as
a
fair
,
and
drew
all
*NL*
classes
with
leisure
at
command
:
to
some
,
who
risked
making
bids
in
*NL*
order
simply
to
raise
prices
,
it
was
almost
equal
to
betting
at
the
*NL*
races
.
The
second
day
,
when
the
best
furniture
was
to
be
sold
,
*NL*
``
everybody
''
was
there
;
even
Mr.
Thesiger
,
the
rector
of
St.
Peter
's
,
*NL*
had
looked
in
for
a
short
time
,
wishing
to
buy
the
carved
table
,
and
*NL*
had
rubbed
elbows
with
Mr.
Bambridge
and
Mr.
Horrock
.
There
was
a
*NL*
wreath
of
Middlemarch
ladies
accommodated
with
seats
round
the
large
*NL*
table
in
the
dining-room
,
where
Mr.
Borthrop
Trumbull
was
mounted
with
*NL*
desk
and
hammer
;
but
the
rows
chiefly
of
masculine
faces
behind
were
*NL*
often
varied
by
incomings
and
outgoings
both
from
the
door
and
the
*NL*
large
bow-window
opening
on
to
the
lawn
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Everybody
''
that
day
did
not
include
Mr.
Bulstrode
,
whose
health
could
*NL*
not
well
endure
crowds
and
draughts
.
But
Mrs.
Bulstrode
had
*NL*
particularly
wished
to
have
a
certain
picture
--
a
``
Supper
at
Emmaus
,
''
*NL*
attributed
in
the
catalogue
to
Guido
;
and
at
the
last
moment
before
the
*NL*
day
of
the
sale
Mr.
Bulstrode
had
called
at
the
office
of
the
*NL*
``
Pioneer
,
''
of
which
he
was
now
one
of
the
proprietors
,
to
beg
of
Mr.
*NL*
Ladislaw
as
a
great
favor
that
he
would
obligingly
use
his
remarkable
*NL*
knowledge
of
pictures
on
behalf
of
Mrs.
Bulstrode
,
and
judge
of
the
*NL*
value
of
this
particular
painting
--
``
if
,
''
added
the
scrupulously
polite
*NL*
banker
,
``
attendance
at
the
sale
would
not
interfere
with
the
*NL*
arrangements
for
your
departure
,
which
I
know
is
imminent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
proviso
might
have
sounded
rather
satirically
in
Will
's
ear
if
he
*NL*
had
been
in
a
mood
to
care
about
such
satire
.
It
referred
to
an
*NL*
understanding
entered
into
many
weeks
before
with
the
proprietors
of
*NL*
the
paper
,
that
he
should
be
at
liberty
any
day
he
pleased
to
hand
over
*NL*
the
management
to
the
subeditor
whom
he
had
been
training
;
since
he
*NL*
wished
finally
to
quit
Middlemarch
.
But
indefinite
visions
of
ambition
*NL*
are
weak
against
the
ease
of
doing
what
is
habitual
or
beguilingly
*NL*
agreeable
;
and
we
all
know
the
difficulty
of
carrying
out
a
resolve
*NL*
when
we
secretly
long
that
it
may
turn
out
to
be
unnecessary
.
In
such
*NL*
states
of
mind
the
most
incredulous
person
has
a
private
leaning
*NL*
towards
miracle
:
impossible
to
conceive
how
our
wish
could
be
*NL*
fulfilled
,
still
--
very
wonderful
things
have
happened
!
Will
did
not
*NL*
confess
this
weakness
to
himself
,
but
he
lingered
.
What
was
the
use
of
*NL*
going
to
London
at
that
time
of
the
year
?
The
Rugby
men
who
would
*NL*
remember
him
were
not
there
;
and
so
far
as
political
writing
was
*NL*
concerned
,
he
would
rather
for
a
few
weeks
go
on
with
the
``
Pioneer
.
''
*NL*
At
the
present
moment
,
however
,
when
Mr.
Bulstrode
was
speaking
to
him
,
*NL*
he
had
both
a
strengthened
resolve
to
go
and
an
equally
strong
resolve
*NL*
not
to
go
till
he
had
once
more
seen
Dorothea
.
Hence
he
replied
that
*NL*
he
had
reasons
for
deferring
his
departure
a
little
,
and
would
be
happy
*NL*
to
go
to
the
sale
.
*NL*
*NL*
Will
was
in
a
defiant
mood
,
his
consciousness
being
deeply
stung
with
*NL*
the
thought
that
the
people
who
looked
at
him
probably
knew
a
fact
*NL*
tantamount
to
an
accusation
against
him
as
a
fellow
with
low
designs
*NL*
which
were
to
be
frustrated
by
a
disposal
of
property
.
Like
most
*NL*
people
who
assert
their
freedom
with
regard
to
conventional
*NL*
distinction
,
he
was
prepared
to
be
sudden
and
quick
at
quarrel
with
any
*NL*
one
who
might
hint
that
he
had
personal
reasons
for
that
assertion
--
that
*NL*
there
was
anything
in
his
blood
,
his
bearing
,
or
his
character
to
*NL*
which
he
gave
the
mask
of
an
opinion
.
When
he
was
under
an
irritating
*NL*
impression
of
this
kind
he
would
go
about
for
days
with
a
defiant
look
,
*NL*
the
color
changing
in
his
transparent
skin
as
if
he
were
on
the
qui
*NL*
vive
,
watching
for
something
which
he
had
to
dart
upon
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
expression
was
peculiarly
noticeable
in
him
at
the
sale
,
and
those
*NL*
who
had
only
seen
him
in
his
moods
of
gentle
oddity
or
of
bright
*NL*
enjoyment
would
have
been
struck
with
a
contrast
.
He
was
not
sorry
to
*NL*
have
this
occasion
for
appearing
in
public
before
the
Middlemarch
*NL*
tribes
of
Toller
,
Hackbutt
,
and
the
rest
,
who
looked
down
on
him
as
an
*NL*
adventurer
,
and
were
in
a
state
of
brutal
ignorance
about
Dante
--
who
*NL*
sneered
at
his
Polish
blood
,
and
were
themselves
of
a
breed
very
much
*NL*
in
need
of
crossing
.
He
stood
in
a
conspicuous
place
not
far
from
the
*NL*
auctioneer
,
with
a
fore-finger
in
each
side-pocket
and
his
head
thrown
*NL*
backward
,
not
caring
to
speak
to
anybody
,
though
he
had
been
cordially
*NL*
welcomed
as
a
connoiss_ure
_
by
Mr.
Trumbull
,
who
was
enjoying
the
*NL*
utmost
activity
of
his
great
faculties
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
surely
among
all
men
whose
vocation
requires
them
to
exhibit
their
*NL*
powers
of
speech
,
the
happiest
is
a
prosperous
provincial
auctioneer
*NL*
keenly
alive
to
his
own
jokes
and
sensible
of
his
encyclopedic
*NL*
knowledge
.
Some
saturnine
,
sour-blooded
persons
might
object
to
be
*NL*
constantly
insisting
on
the
merits
of
all
articles
from
boot-jacks
to
*NL*
``
Berghems
;
''
but
Mr.
Borthrop
Trumbull
had
a
kindly
liquid
in
his
veins
;
*NL*
he
was
an
admirer
by
nature
,
and
would
have
liked
to
have
the
universe
*NL*
under
his
hammer
,
feeling
that
it
would
go
at
a
higher
figure
for
his
*NL*
recommendation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
Mrs.
Larcher
's
drawing-room
furniture
was
enough
for
him
.
*NL*
When
Will
Ladislaw
had
come
in
,
a
second
fender
,
said
to
have
been
*NL*
forgotten
in
its
right
place
,
suddenly
claimed
the
auctioneer
's
*NL*
enthusiasm
,
which
he
distributed
on
the
equitable
principle
of
praising
*NL*
those
things
most
which
were
most
in
need
of
praise
.
The
fender
was
of
*NL*
polished
steel
,
with
much
lancet-shaped
open-work
and
a
sharp
edge
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
ladies
,
''
said
he
,
``
I
shall
appeal
to
you
.
Here
is
a
fender
which
*NL*
at
any
other
sale
would
hardly
be
offered
with
out
reserve
,
being
,
as
I
*NL*
may
say
,
for
quality
of
steel
and
quaintness
of
design
,
a
kind
of
*NL*
thing
''
--
here
Mr.
Trumbull
dropped
his
voice
and
became
slightly
nasal
,
*NL*
trimming
his
outlines
with
his
left
finger
--
``
that
might
not
fall
in
*NL*
with
ordinary
tastes

Allow
me
to
tell
you
that
by-and-by
this

*NL*
of
workmanship
will
be
the
only
one
in
vogue

half-a-crown

you
said

*NL*
thank
you

at
half-a-crown

characteristic
fender

and
I
*NL*
have
particular
information
that
the
antique
style
is
very
much
sought
*NL*
after
in
high
quarters

Three
shillings

it

Look
,
ladies
,
at
the
chastity
of
the
design

I
have
*NL*
no
doubt
myself
that
it
was
turned
out
in
the
last
century

Mawmsey

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
not
a
thing
I
would
put
in

drawing-room

said
Mrs.
Mawmsey
,
*NL*
audibly
,
for
the
warning
of
the
rash
husband
.
``
I
wonder
_
at
_
Mrs.
*NL*
Larcher
.
Every
blessed
child

head
that
fell
against
it

be
cut
*NL*
in

The
edge
is
like

*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
true

''
rejoined
Mr.
Trumbull
,
quickly
,
``
and
most
uncommonly
*NL*
useful
to
have
a
fender

will
cut

you
have
a

*NL*
shoe-tie
or
a
bit
of
string
that
wants
cutting
and
no
knife
at
hand
:
*NL*
many
a
man
has
been
left
hanging
because
there
was
no
knife
to
cut
him
*NL*
down
.
Gentlemen
,
here
's
a
fender
that
if
you
had
the
misfortune
to
*NL*
hang
yourselves
would
cut
you
down
in
no
time

with
astonishing
*NL*
celerity

four-and-sixpence

five

five-and-sixpence

appropriate

a
spare

there
was
a

little
out
of
his
mind

''
The
auctioneer
's
glance
,
which
had
*NL*
been
searching
round
him
with
a
preternatural
susceptibility
to
all
*NL*
signs
of
bidding
,
here
dropped
on
the
paper
before
him
,
and
his
voice
*NL*
too
dropped
into
a
tone
of
indifferent
despatch
as
he
said
,
``
Mr.
*NL*
Clintup
.
Be
handy
,
Joseph
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
worth
six
shillings
to
have
a
fender
you
could
always
tell
that
*NL*
joke
on
,
''
said
Mr.
Clintup
,
laughing
low
and
apologetically
to
his
next
*NL*
neighbor
.
He
was
a
diffident
though
distinguished
nurseryman
,
and
*NL*
feared
that
the
audience
might
regard
his
bid
as
a
foolish
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
Joseph
had
brought
a
trayful
of
small
articles
.
``
Now
,
*NL*
ladies
,
''
said
Mr.
Trumbull
,
taking
up
one
of
the
articles
,
``
this
tray
*NL*
contains
a
very
recherchy
lot
--
a
collection
of
trifles
for
the
*NL*
drawing-room
table

and
trifles
make
the
sum
_
of
_
human
things
--
nothing
*NL*
more
important
than
trifles

Mr.
Ladislaw

round

Joseph
--
these
bijoux

*NL*
This
I
have
in
my
hand
is
an
ingenious
contrivance
--
a
sort
of
*NL*
practical
rebus
,
I
may
call
it
:
here
,
you
see
,
it
looks
like
an
elegant
*NL*
heart-shaped
box
,
portable
--
for
the
pocket
;
there
,
again
,
it
becomes
*NL*
like
a
splendid
double
flower
--
an
ornament
for
the
table
;
and
now
''
--
Mr.
*NL*
Trumbull
allowed
the
flower
to
fall
alarmingly
into
strings
of
*NL*
heart-shaped
leaves
--
``
a
book
of
riddles
!
No
less
than
five
hundred
*NL*
printed
in

beautiful
red
.
Gentlemen
,
if
I
had
less
of
a
conscience
,
*NL*
I
should
not
wish
you
to
bid
high
for
this
lot
--
I
have
a
longing
for
*NL*
it
myself
.
What
can
promote
innocent
mirth
,
and
I
may
say
virtue
,
more
*NL*
than
a
good
riddle
?
--
it
hinders
profane
language
,
and
attaches
a
man
to
*NL*
the
society
of
refined
females
.
This
ingenious
article
itself
,
without
*NL*
the
elegant
domino-box
,
card-basket
,
&
c.
,
ought
alone
to
give
a
high
*NL*
price
to
the
lot
.
Carried
in
the
pocket
it
might
make
an
individual
*NL*
welcome
in
any
society

Four
shillings
,

?
--
four
shillings
for
this
*NL*
remarkable
collection
of
riddles
with
the

caeteras

Here
is
a
*NL*
sample
:
`
How
must
you
spell
honey
to
make
it
catch
lady-birds
?
*NL*
Answer
--
money
.
'
You
hear
?
--
lady-birds
--
honey
money

This
is
an
*NL*
amusement
to
sharpen
the
intellect
;
it
has
a
sting
--
it
has
what
we
call
*NL*
satire
,
and
wit
without
indecency
.
Four-and-sixpence
--
five
shillings
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
bidding
ran
on
with
warming
rivalry
.
Mr.
Bowyer
was
a
bidder
,
and
*NL*
this
was
too
exasperating
.
Bowyer
could
n't
afford
it
,
and
only
wanted
*NL*
to
hinder
every
other
man
from
making
a
figure
.
The
current
carried
*NL*
even
Mr.
Horrock
with
it
,
but
this
committal
of
himself
to
an
opinion
*NL*
fell
from
him
with
so
little
sacrifice
of
his
neutral
expression
,
that
*NL*
the
bid
might
not
have
been
detected
as
his
but
for
the
friendly
oaths
*NL*
of
Mr.
Bambridge
,
who
wanted
to
know
what
Horrock
would
do
with
blasted
*NL*
stuff
only
fit
for
haberdashers
given
over
to
that
state
of
perdition
*NL*
which
the
horse-dealer
so
cordially
recognized
in
the
majority
of
*NL*
earthly
existences
.
The
lot
was
finally
knocked
down
at
a
guinea
to
*NL*
Mr.
Spilkins
,
a
young
Slender
of
the
neighborhood
,
who
was
reckless
*NL*
with
his
pocket-money
and
felt
his
want
of
memory
for
riddles
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
Trumbull
,
this
is
too
bad
--
you
've
been
putting
some
old
maid
's
*NL*
rubbish
into
the
sale

''
murmured
Mr.
Toller
,
getting
close
to
the
*NL*
auctioneer
.
``
I
want
to
see
how

I
must
be
off

_
Im_mediately

Now
,
gentlemen
,
you
who
are
connoiss_ures
_
,
you
are
going
to
have
*NL*
a
treat
.
Here
is
an
engraving
of
the
Duke
of
Wellington
surrounded
by
*NL*
his
staff
on
the
Field
of
Waterloo
;
and
notwithstanding
recent
events
*NL*
which
have
,
as
it
were
,
enveloped
our
great
Hero
in
a
cloud
,
I
will
be
*NL*
bold
to
say
--
for
a
man
in
my
line
must
not
be
blown
about
by
political
*NL*
winds
--
that
a
finer
subject
--
of
the
modern
order
,
belonging
to
our
own
*NL*
time
and
epoch
--
the
understanding
of
man
could
hardly
conceive
:
angels
*NL*
might
,
perhaps
,
but
not
men
,
sirs
,
not
men
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
painted
it
?
''
said
Mr.
Powderell
,
much
impressed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
proof
before
the
letter
,
Mr.
Powderell
--
the
painter
is
not
*NL*
known
,
''
answered
Trumbull
,
with
a
certain
gaspingness
in
his
last
*NL*
words
,
after
which
he
pursed
up
his
lips
and
stared
round
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
bid
a
pound
!
''
said
Mr.
Powderell
,
in
a
tone
of
resolved
emotion
,
*NL*
as
of
a
man
ready
to
put
himself
in
the
breach
.
Whether
from
awe
or
*NL*
pity
,
nobody
raised
the
price
on
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Next
came
two
Dutch
prints
which
Mr.
Toller
had
been
eager
for
,
and
*NL*
after
he
had
secured
them
he
went
away
.
Other
prints
,
and
afterwards
*NL*
some
paintings
,
were
sold
to
leading
Middlemarchers
who
had
come
with
a
*NL*
special
desire
for
them
,
and
there
was
a
more
active
movement
of
the
*NL*
audience
in
and
out
;
some
,
who
had
bought
what
they
wanted
,
going
away
,
*NL*
others
coming
in
either
quite
newly
or
from
a
temporary
visit
to
the
*NL*
refreshments
which
were
spread
under
the
marquee
on
the
lawn
.
It
was
*NL*
this
marquee
that
Mr.
Bambridge
was
bent
on
buying
,
and
he
appeared
to
*NL*
like
looking
inside
it
frequently
,
as
a
foretaste
of
its
possession
.
*NL*
On
the
last
occasion
of
his
return
from
it
he
was
observed
to
bring
*NL*
with
him
a
new
companion
,
a
stranger
to
Mr.
Trumbull
and
every
one
*NL*
else
,
whose
appearance
,
however
,
led
to
the
supposition
that
he
might
*NL*
be
a
relative
of
the
horse-dealer
's
--
also
``
given
to
indulgence
.
''
His
*NL*
large
whiskers
,
imposing
swagger
,
and
swing
of
the
leg
,
made
him
a
*NL*
striking
figure
;
but
his
suit
of
black
,
rather
shabby
at
the
edges
,
*NL*
caused
the
prejudicial
inference
that
he
was
not
able
to
afford
himself
*NL*
as
much
indulgence
as
he
liked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
it
you
've
picked
up
,
Bam
?
''
said
Mr.
Horrock
,
aside
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ask
him
yourself
,
''
returned
Mr.
Bambridge
.
``
He
said
he
'd
just
turned
*NL*
in
from
the
road
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Horrock
eyed
the
stranger
,
who
was
leaning
back
against
his
stick
*NL*
with
one
hand
,
using
his
toothpick
with
the
other
,
and
looking
about
*NL*
him
with
a
certain
restlessness
apparently
under
the
silence
imposed
on
*NL*
him
by
circumstances
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
the
``
Supper
at
Emmaus
''
was
brought
forward
,
to
Will
's
immense
*NL*
relief
,
for
he
was
getting
so
tired
of
the
proceedings
that
he
had
*NL*
drawn
back
a
little
and
leaned
his
shoulder
against
the
wall
just
*NL*
behind
the
auctioneer
.
He
now
came
forward
again
,
and
his
eye
caught
*NL*
the
conspicuous
stranger
,
who
,
rather
to
his
surprise
,
was
staring
at
*NL*
him
markedly
.
But
Will
was
immediately
appealed
to
by
Mr.
Trumbull
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Mr.
Ladislaw
,
yes
;
this
interests
you
as
a
connoiss_ure
_
,
I
*NL*
think
.
It
is
some
pleasure
,
''
the
auctioneer
went
on
with
a
rising
*NL*
fervor
,
``
to
have
a
picture
like
this
to
show
to
a
company
of
ladies
and
*NL*
gentlemen
--
a
picture
worth
any
sum
to
an
individual
whose
means
were
on
*NL*
a
level
with
his
judgment
.
It
is
a
painting
of
the
Italian
school
--
by
*NL*
the
celebrated
Guydo
,
the
greatest
painter
in
the
world
,
the
chief
of
*NL*
the
Old
Masters
,
as
they
are
called
--
I
take
it
,
because
they
were
up
*NL*
to
a
thing
or
two
beyond
most
of
us
--
in
possession
of
secrets
now
lost
*NL*
to
the
bulk
of
mankind
.
Let
me
tell
you
,
gentlemen
,
I
have
seen
a
*NL*
great
many
pictures
by
the
Old
Masters
,
and
they
are
not
all
up
to
this
*NL*
mark
--
some
of
them
are
darker
than
you
might
like
and
not
family
*NL*
subjects
.
But
here
is
a
Guydo
--
the
frame
alone
is
worth
pounds
--
which
*NL*
any
lady
might
be
proud
to
hang
up
--
a
suitable
thing
for
what
we
call
a
*NL*
refectory
in
a
charitable
institution
,
if
any
gentleman
of
the
*NL*
Corporation
wished
to
show
his
munifi_cence
_
.
Turn
it
a
little
,
sir
?
*NL*
yes
.
Joseph
,
turn
it
a
little
towards
Mr.
Ladislaw
--
Mr.
Ladislaw
,
*NL*
having
been
abroad
,
understands
the
merit
of
these
things
,
you
observe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
eyes
were
for
a
moment
turned
towards
Will
,
who
said
,
coolly
,
``
Five
*NL*
pounds
.
''
The
auctioneer
burst
out
in
deep
remonstrance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
Mr.
Ladislaw
!
the
frame
alone
is
worth
that
.
Ladies
and
*NL*
gentlemen
,
for
the
credit
of
the
town
!
Suppose
it
should
be
discovered
*NL*
hereafter
that
a
gem
of
art
has
been
amongst
us
in
this
town
,
and
*NL*
nobody
in
Middlemarch
awake
to
it
.
Five
guineas
--
five
seven-six
--
five
*NL*
ten
.
Still
,
ladies
,
still
!
It
is
a
gem
,
and
`
Full
many
a
gem
,
'
as
the
*NL*
poet
says
,
has
been
allowed
to
go
at
a
nominal
price
because
the
public
*NL*
knew
no
better
,
because
it
was
offered
in
circles
where
there
was
--
I
*NL*
was
going
to
say
a
low
feeling
,
but
no
!
--
Six
pounds
--
six
guineas
--
a
*NL*
Guydo
of
the
first
order
going
at
six
guineas
--
it
is
an
insult
to
*NL*
religion
,
ladies
;
it
touches
us
all
as
Christians
,
gentlemen
,
that
a
*NL*
subject
like
this
should
go
at
such
a
low
figure
--
six
pounds
*NL*
ten
--
seven
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
bidding
was
brisk
,
and
Will
continued
to
share
in
it
,
remembering
*NL*
that
Mrs.
Bulstrode
had
a
strong
wish
for
the
picture
,
and
thinking
*NL*
that
he
might
stretch
the
price
to
twelve
pounds
.
But
it
was
knocked
*NL*
down
to
him
at
ten
guineas
,
whereupon
he
pushed
his
way
towards
the
*NL*
bow-window
and
went
out
.
He
chose
to
go
under
the
marquee
to
get
a
*NL*
glass
of
water
,
being
hot
and
thirsty
:
it
was
empty
of
other
visitors
,
*NL*
and
he
asked
the
woman
in
attendance
to
fetch
him
some
fresh
water
;
but
*NL*
before
she
was
well
gone
he
was
annoyed
to
see
entering
the
florid
*NL*
stranger
who
had
stared
at
him
.
It
struck
Will
at
this
moment
that
the
*NL*
man
might
be
one
of
those
political
parasitic
insects
of
the
bloated
*NL*
kind
who
had
once
or
twice
claimed
acquaintance
with
him
as
having
*NL*
heard
him
speak
on
the
Reform
question
,
and
who
might
think
of
getting
*NL*
a
shilling
by
news
.
In
this
light
his
person
,
already
rather
heating
*NL*
to
behold
on
a
summer
's
day
,
appeared
the
more
disagreeable
;
and
Will
,
*NL*
half-seated
on
the
elbow
of
a
garden-chair
,
turned
his
eyes
carefully
*NL*
away
from
the
comer
.
But
this
signified
little
to
our
acquaintance
Mr.
*NL*
Raffles
,
who
never
hesitated
to
thrust
himself
on
unwilling
*NL*
observation
,
if
it
suited
his
purpose
to
do
so
.
He
moved
a
step
or
two
*NL*
till
he
was
in
front
of
Will
,
and
said
with
full-mouthed
haste
,
``
Excuse
*NL*
me
,
Mr.
Ladislaw
--
was
your
mother
's
name
Sarah
Dunkirk
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Will
,
starting
to
his
feet
,
moved
backward
a
step
,
frowning
,
and
saying
*NL*
with
some
fierceness
,
``
Yes
,
sir
,
it
was
.
And
what
is
that
to
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
in
Will
's
nature
that
the
first
spark
it
threw
out
was
a
direct
*NL*
answer
of
the
question
and
a
challenge
of
the
consequences
.
To
have
*NL*
said
,
``
What
is
that
to
you
?
''
in
the
first
instance
,
would
have
seemed
*NL*
like
shuffling
--
as
if
he
minded
who
knew
anything
about
his
origin
!
*NL*
*NL*
Raffles
on
his
side
had
not
the
same
eagerness
for
a
collision
which
*NL*
was
implied
in
Ladislaw
's
threatening
air
.
The
slim
young
fellow
with
*NL*
his
girl
's
complexion
looked
like
a
tiger-cat
ready
to
spring
on
him
.
*NL*
Under
such
circumstances
Mr.
Raffles
's
pleasure
in
annoying
his
company
*NL*
was
kept
in
abeyance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
offence
,
my
good
sir
,
no
offence
!
I
only
remember
your
mother
--
knew
*NL*
her
when
she
was
a
girl
.
But
it
is
your
father
that
you
feature
,
*NL*
sir
.
I
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
your
father
too
.
Parents
alive
,
Mr.
*NL*
Ladislaw
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
!
''
thundered
Will
,
in
the
same
attitude
as
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Should
be
glad
to
do
you
a
service
,
Mr.
Ladislaw
--
by
Jove
,
I
should
!
*NL*
Hope
to
meet
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hereupon
Raffles
,
who
had
lifted
his
hat
with
the
last
words
,
turned
*NL*
himself
round
with
a
swing
of
his
leg
and
walked
away
.
Will
looked
*NL*
after
him
a
moment
,
and
could
see
that
he
did
not
re-enter
the
*NL*
auction-room
,
but
appeared
to
be
walking
towards
the
road
.
For
an
*NL*
instant
he
thought
that
he
had
been
foolish
not
to
let
the
man
go
on
*NL*
talking
;
--
but
no
!
on
the
whole
he
preferred
doing
without
knowledge
*NL*
from
that
source
.
*NL*
*NL*
Later
in
the
evening
,
however
,
Raffles
overtook
him
in
the
street
,
and
*NL*
appearing
either
to
have
forgotten
the
roughness
of
his
former
*NL*
reception
or
to
intend
avenging
it
by
a
forgiving
familiarity
,
greeted
*NL*
him
jovially
and
walked
by
his
side
,
remarking
at
first
on
the
*NL*
pleasantness
of
the
town
and
neighborhood
.
Will
suspected
that
the
man
*NL*
had
been
drinking
and
was
considering
how
to
shake
him
off
when
Raffles
*NL*
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
been
abroad
myself
,
Mr.
Ladislaw
--
I
've
seen
the
world
--
used
to
*NL*
parley-vous
a
little
.
It
was
at
Boulogne
I
saw
your
father
--
a
most
*NL*
uncommon
likeness
you
are
of
him
,
by
Jove
!

--
nose
--
eyes
--
hair
*NL*
turned
off
your
brow
just
like
his
--
a
little
in
the
foreign
style
.
*NL*
John
Bull
does
n't
do
much
of
that
.
But
your
father
was
very
ill
when
I
*NL*
saw
him
.
Lord
,
lord
!
hands
you
might
see
through
.
You
were
a
small
*NL*
youngster
then
.
Did
he
get
well
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Will
,
curtly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
Well
!
I
've
often
wondered
what
became
of
your
mother
.
She
ran
*NL*
away
from
her
friends
when
she
was
a
young
lass
--
a
proud-spirited
*NL*
lass
,
and
pretty
,
by
Jove
!
I
knew
the
reason
why
she
ran
away
,
''
said
*NL*
Raffles
,
winking
slowly
as
he
looked
sideways
at
Will
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
nothing
dishonorable
of
her
,
sir
,
''
said
Will
,
turning
on
him
*NL*
rather
savagely
.
But
Mr.
Raffles
just
now
was
not
sensitive
to
shades
*NL*
of
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
a
bit
!
''
said
he
,
tossing
his
head
decisively
``
She
was
a
little
too
*NL*
honorable
to
like
her
friends
--
that
was
it
!
''
Here
Raffles
again
winked
*NL*
slowly
.
``
Lord
bless
you
,
I
knew
all
about
'em
--
a
little
in
what
you
*NL*
may
call
the
respectable
thieving
line
--
the
high
style
of
*NL*
receiving-house
--
none
of
your
holes
and
corners
--
first-rate
.
Slap-up
*NL*
shop
,
high
profits
and
no
mistake
.
But
Lord
!
Sarah
would
have
known
*NL*
nothing
about
it
--
a
dashing
young
lady
she
was
--
fine
*NL*
boarding-school
--
fit
for
a
lord
's
wife
--
only
Archie
Duncan
threw
it
at
*NL*
her
out
of
spite
,
because
she
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
him
.
And
*NL*
so
she
ran
away
from
the
whole
concern
.
I
travelled
for
'em
,
sir
,
in
a
*NL*
gentlemanly
way
--
at
a
high
salary
.
They
did
n't
mind
her
running
away
*NL*
at
first
--
godly
folks
,
sir
,
very
godly
--
and
she
was
for
the
stage
.
The
*NL*
son
was
alive
then
,
and
the
daughter
was
at
a
discount
.
Hallo
!
here
we
*NL*
are
at
the
Blue
Bull
.
What
do
you
say
,
Mr.
Ladislaw
?
--
shall
we
turn
in
*NL*
and
have
a
glass
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
must
say
good
evening
,
''
said
Will
,
dashing
up
a
passage
which
*NL*
led
into
Lowick
Gate
,
and
almost
running
to
get
out
of
Raffles
's
reach
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
walked
a
long
while
on
the
Lowick
road
away
from
the
town
,
glad
of
*NL*
the
starlit
darkness
when
it
came
.
He
felt
as
if
he
had
had
dirt
cast
*NL*
on
him
amidst
shouts
of
scorn
.
There
was
this
to
confirm
the
fellow
's
*NL*
statement
--
that
his
mother
never
would
tell
him
the
reason
why
she
had
*NL*
run
away
from
her
family
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
!
what
was
he
,
Will
Ladislaw
,
the
worse
,
supposing
the
truth
about
*NL*
that
family
to
be
the
ugliest
?
His
mother
had
braved
hardship
in
order
*NL*
to
separate
herself
from
it
.
But
if
Dorothea
's
friends
had
known
this
*NL*
story
--
if
the
Chettams
had
known
it
--
they
would
have
had
a
fine
color
*NL*
to
give
their
suspicions
a
welcome
ground
for
thinking
him
unfit
to
*NL*
come
near
her
.
However
,
let
them
suspect
what
they
pleased
,
they
would
*NL*
find
themselves
in
the
wrong
.
They
would
find
out
that
the
blood
in
*NL*
his
veins
was
as
free
from
the
taint
of
meanness
as
theirs
.

The
same
night
,
when
Mr.
Bulstrode
returned
from
a
journey
to
Brassing
*NL*
on
business
,
his
good
wife
met
him
in
the
entrance-hall
and
drew
him
*NL*
into
his
private
sitting-room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nicholas
,
''
she
said
,
fixing
her
honest
eyes
upon
him
anxiously
,
``
there
*NL*
has
been
such
a
disagreeable
man
here
asking
for
you
--
it
has
made
me
*NL*
quite
uncomfortable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
kind
of
man
,
my
dear
,
''
said
Mr.
Bulstrode
,
dreadfully
certain
of
*NL*
the
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
red-faced
man
with
large
whiskers
,
and
most
impudent
in
his
manner
.
*NL*
He
declared
he
was
an
old
friend
of
yours
,
and
said
you
would
be
sorry
*NL*
not
to
see
him
.
He
wanted
to
wait
for
you
here
,
but
I
told
him
he
*NL*
could
see
you
at
the
Bank
to-morrow
morning
.
Most
impudent
he
*NL*
was
!
--
stared
at
me
,
and
said
his
friend
Nick
had
luck
in
wives
.
I
*NL*
do
n't
believe
he
would
have
gone
away
,
if
Blucher
had
not
happened
to
*NL*
break
his
chain
and
come
running
round
on
the
gravel
--
for
I
was
in
the
*NL*
garden
;
so
I
said
,
`
You
'd
better
go
away
--
the
dog
is
very
fierce
,
and
I
*NL*
ca
n't
hold
him
.
'
Do
you
really
know
anything
of
such
a
man
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
I
know
who
he
is
,
my
dear
,
''
said
Mr.
Bulstrode
,
in
his
usual
*NL*
subdued
voice
,
``
an
unfortunate
dissolute
wretch
,
whom
I
helped
too
much
*NL*
in
days
gone
by
.
However
,
I
presume
you
will
not
be
troubled
by
him
*NL*
again
.
He
will
probably
come
to
the
Bank
--
to
beg
,
doubtless
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
No
more
was
said
on
the
subject
until
the
next
day
,
when
Mr.
Bulstrode
*NL*
had
returned
from
the
town
and
was
dressing
for
dinner
.
His
wife
,
not
*NL*
sure
that
he
was
come
home
,
looked
into
his
dressing-room
and
saw
him
*NL*
with
his
coat
and
cravat
off
,
leaning
one
arm
on
a
chest
of
drawers
and
*NL*
staring
absently
at
the
ground
.
He
started
nervously
and
looked
up
as
*NL*
she
entered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
look
very
ill
,
Nicholas
.
Is
there
anything
the
matter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
a
good
deal
of
pain
in
my
head
,
''
said
Mr.
Bulstrode
,
who
was
so
*NL*
frequently
ailing
that
his
wife
was
always
ready
to
believe
in
this
*NL*
cause
of
depression
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sit
down
and
let
me
sponge
it
with
vinegar
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Physically
Mr.
Bulstrode
did
not
want
the
vinegar
,
but
morally
the
*NL*
affectionate
attention
soothed
him
.
Though
always
polite
,
it
was
his
*NL*
habit
to
receive
such
services
with
marital
coolness
,
as
his
wife
's
*NL*
duty
.
But
to-day
,
while
she
was
bending
over
him
,
he
said
,
``
You
are
*NL*
very
good
,
Harriet
,
''
in
a
tone
which
had
something
new
in
it
to
her
*NL*
ear
;
she
did
not
know
exactly
what
the
novelty
was
,
but
her
woman
's
*NL*
solicitude
shaped
itself
into
a
darting
thought
that
he
might
be
going
*NL*
to
have
an
illness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
anything
worried
you
?
''
she
said
.
``
Did
that
man
come
to
you
at
the
*NL*
Bank
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
it
was
as
I
had
supposed
.
He
is
a
man
who
at
one
time
might
have
*NL*
done
better
.
But
he
has
sunk
into
a
drunken
debauched
creature
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
he
quite
gone
away
?
''
said
Mrs.
Bulstrode
,
anxiously
but
for
certain
*NL*
reasons
she
refrained
from
adding
,
``
It
was
very
disagreeable
to
hear
*NL*
him
calling
himself
a
friend
of
yours
.
''
At
that
moment
she
would
not
*NL*
have
liked
to
say
anything
which
implied
her
habitual
consciousness
*NL*
that
her
husband
's
earlier
connections
were
not
quite
on
a
level
with
*NL*
her
own
.
Not
that
she
knew
much
about
them
.
That
her
husband
had
at
*NL*
first
been
employed
in
a
bank
,
that
he
had
afterwards
entered
into
what
*NL*
he
called
city
business
and
gained
a
fortune
before
he
was
*NL*
three-and-thirty
,
that
he
had
married
a
widow
who
was
much
older
than
*NL*
himself
--
a
Dissenter
,
and
in
other
ways
probably
of
that
*NL*
disadvantageous
quality
usually
perceptible
in
a
first
wife
if
inquired
*NL*
into
with
the
dispassionate
judgment
of
a
second
--
was
almost
as
much
as
*NL*
she
had
cared
to
learn
beyond
the
glimpses
which
Mr.
Bulstrode
's
*NL*
narrative
occasionally
gave
of
his
early
bent
towards
religion
,
his
*NL*
inclination
to
be
a
preacher
,
and
his
association
with
missionary
and
*NL*
philanthropic
efforts
.
She
believed
in
him
as
an
excellent
man
whose
*NL*
piety
carried
a
peculiar
eminence
in
belonging
to
a
layman
,
whose
*NL*
influence
had
turned
her
own
mind
toward
seriousness
,
and
whose
share
*NL*
of
perishable
good
had
been
the
means
of
raising
her
own
position
.
But
*NL*
she
also
liked
to
think
that
it
was
well
in
every
sense
for
Mr.
*NL*
Bulstrode
to
have
won
the
hand
of
Harriet
Vincy
;
whose
family
was
*NL*
undeniable
in
a
Middlemarch
light
--
a
better
light
surely
than
any
*NL*
thrown
in
London
thoroughfares
or
dissenting
chapel-yards
.
The
*NL*
unreformed
provincial
mind
distrusted
London
;
and
while
true
religion
*NL*
was
everywhere
saving
,
honest
Mrs.
Bulstrode
was
convinced
that
to
be
*NL*
saved
in
the
Church
was
more
respectable
.
She
so
much
wished
to
ignore
*NL*
towards
others
that
her
husband
had
ever
been
a
London
Dissenter
,
that
*NL*
she
liked
to
keep
it
out
of
sight
even
in
talking
to
him
.
He
was
quite
*NL*
aware
of
this
;
indeed
in
some
respects
he
was
rather
afraid
of
this
*NL*
ingenuous
wife
,
whose
imitative
piety
and
native
worldliness
were
*NL*
equally
sincere
,
who
had
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
,
and
whom
he
had
*NL*
married
out
of
a
thorough
inclination
still
subsisting
.
But
his
fears
*NL*
were
such
as
belong
to
a
man
who
cares
to
maintain
his
recognized
*NL*
supremacy
:
the
loss
of
high
consideration
from
his
wife
,
as
from
every
*NL*
one
else
who
did
not
clearly
hate
him
out
of
enmity
to
the
truth
,
would
*NL*
be
as
the
beginning
of
death
to
him
.
When
she
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
he
quite
gone
away
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
trust
so
,
''
he
answered
,
with
an
effort
to
throw
as
much
sober
*NL*
unconcern
into
his
tone
as
possible
!
*NL*
*NL*
But
in
truth
Mr.
Bulstrode
was
very
far
from
a
state
of
quiet
trust
.
*NL*
In
the
interview
at
the
Bank
,
Raffles
had
made
it
evident
that
his
*NL*
eagerness
to
torment
was
almost
as
strong
in
him
as
any
other
greed
.
*NL*
He
had
frankly
said
that
he
had
turned
out
of
the
way
to
come
to
*NL*
Middlemarch
,
just
to
look
about
him
and
see
whether
the
neighborhood
*NL*
would
suit
him
to
live
in
.
He
had
certainly
had
a
few
debts
to
pay
*NL*
more
than
he
expected
,
but
the
two
hundred
pounds
were
not
gone
yet
:
a
*NL*
cool
five-and-twenty
would
suffice
him
to
go
away
with
for
the
present
.
*NL*
What
he
had
wanted
chiefly
was
to
see
his
friend
Nick
and
family
,
and
*NL*
know
all
about
the
prosperity
of
a
man
to
whom
he
was
so
much
attached
.
*NL*
By-and-by
he
might
come
back
for
a
longer
stay
.
This
time
Raffles
*NL*
declined
to
be
``
seen
off
the
premises
,
''
as
he
expressed
it
--
declined
to
*NL*
quit
Middlemarch
under
Bulstrode
's
eyes
.
He
meant
to
go
by
coach
the
*NL*
next
day
--
if
he
chose
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bulstrode
felt
himself
helpless
.
Neither
threats
nor
coaxing
could
*NL*
avail
:
he
could
not
count
on
any
persistent
fear
nor
on
any
promise
.
*NL*
On
the
contrary
,
he
felt
a
cold
certainty
at
his
heart
that
*NL*
Raffles
--
unless
providence
sent
death
to
hinder
him
--
would
come
back
*NL*
to
Middlemarch
before
long
.
And
that
certainty
was
a
terror
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
that
he
was
in
danger
of
legal
punishment
or
of
beggary
:
he
*NL*
was
in
danger
only
of
seeing
disclosed
to
the
judgment
of
his
neighbors
*NL*
and
the
mournful
perception
of
his
wife
certain
facts
of
his
past
life
*NL*
which
would
render
him
an
object
of
scorn
and
an
opprobrium
of
the
*NL*
religion
with
which
he
had
diligently
associated
himself
.
The
terror
*NL*
of
being
judged
sharpens
the
memory
:
it
sends
an
inevitable
glare
over
*NL*
that
long-unvisited
past
which
has
been
habitually
recalled
only
in
*NL*
general
phrases
.
Even
without
memory
,
the
life
is
bound
into
one
by
a
*NL*
zone
of
dependence
in
growth
and
decay
;
but
intense
memory
forces
a
man
*NL*
to
own
his
blameworthy
past
.
With
memory
set
smarting
like
a
reopened
*NL*
wound
,
a
man
's
past
is
not
simply
a
dead
history
,
an
outworn
*NL*
preparation
of
the
present
:
it
is
not
a
repented
error
shaken
loose
*NL*
from
the
life
:
it
is
a
still
quivering
part
of
himself
,
bringing
*NL*
shudders
and
bitter
flavors
and
the
tinglings
of
a
merited
shame
.
*NL*
*NL*
Into
this
second
life
Bulstrode
's
past
had
now
risen
,
only
the
*NL*
pleasures
of
it
seeming
to
have
lost
their
quality
.
Night
and
day
,
*NL*
without
interruption
save
of
brief
sleep
which
only
wove
retrospect
and
*NL*
fear
into
a
fantastic
present
,
he
felt
the
scenes
of
his
earlier
life
*NL*
coming
between
him
and
everything
else
,
as
obstinately
as
when
we
look
*NL*
through
the
window
from
a
lighted
room
,
the
objects
we
turn
our
backs
*NL*
on
are
still
before
us
,
instead
of
the
grass
and
the
trees
.
The
*NL*
successive
events
inward
and
outward
were
there
in
one
view
:
though
*NL*
each
might
be
dwelt
on
in
turn
,
the
rest
still
kept
their
hold
in
the
*NL*
consciousness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Once
more
he
saw
himself
the
young
banker
's
clerk
,
with
an
agreeable
*NL*
person
,
as
clever
in
figures
as
he
was
fluent
in
speech
and
fond
of
*NL*
theological
definition
:
an
eminent
though
young
member
of
a
Calvinistic
*NL*
dissenting
church
at
Highbury
,
having
had
striking
experience
in
*NL*
conviction
of
sin
and
sense
of
pardon
.
Again
he
heard
himself
called
*NL*
for
as
Brother
Bulstrode
in
prayer
meetings
,
speaking
on
religious
*NL*
platforms
,
preaching
in
private
houses
.
Again
he
felt
himself
thinking
*NL*
of
the
ministry
as
possibly
his
vocation
,
and
inclined
towards
*NL*
missionary
labor
.
That
was
the
happiest
time
of
his
life
:
that
was
the
*NL*
spot
he
would
have
chosen
now
to
awake
in
and
find
the
rest
a
dream
.
*NL*
The
people
among
whom
Brother
Bulstrode
was
distinguished
were
very
*NL*
few
,
but
they
were
very
near
to
him
,
and
stirred
his
satisfaction
the
*NL*
more
;
his
power
stretched
through
a
narrow
space
,
but
he
felt
its
*NL*
effect
the
more
intensely
.
He
believed
without
effort
in
the
peculiar
*NL*
work
of
grace
within
him
,
and
in
the
signs
that
God
intended
him
for
*NL*
special
instrumentality
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
came
the
moment
of
transition
;
it
was
with
the
sense
of
promotion
*NL*
he
had
when
he
,
an
orphan
educated
at
a
commercial
charity-school
,
was
*NL*
invited
to
a
fine
villa
belonging
to
Mr.
Dunkirk
,
the
richest
man
in
*NL*
the
congregation
.
Soon
he
became
an
intimate
there
,
honored
for
his
*NL*
piety
by
the
wife
,
marked
out
for
his
ability
by
the
husband
,
whose
*NL*
wealth
was
due
to
a
flourishing
city
and
west-end
trade
.
That
was
the
*NL*
setting-in
of
a
new
current
for
his
ambition
,
directing
his
prospects
*NL*
of
``
instrumentality
''
towards
the
uniting
of
distinguished
religious
*NL*
gifts
with
successful
business
.
*NL*
*NL*
By-and-by
came
a
decided
external
leading
:
a
confidential
subordinate
*NL*
partner
died
,
and
nobody
seemed
to
the
principal
so
well
fitted
to
fill
*NL*
the
severely
felt
vacancy
as
his
young
friend
Bulstrode
,
if
he
would
*NL*
become
confidential
accountant
.
The
offer
was
accepted
.
The
business
*NL*
was
a
pawnbroker
's
,
of
the
most
magnificent
sort
both
in
extent
and
*NL*
profits
;
and
on
a
short
acquaintance
with
it
Bulstrode
became
aware
*NL*
that
one
source
of
magnificent
profit
was
the
easy
reception
of
any
*NL*
goods
offered
,
without
strict
inquiry
as
to
where
they
came
from
.
But
*NL*
there
was
a
branch
house
at
the
west
end
,
and
no
pettiness
or
dinginess
*NL*
to
give
suggestions
of
shame
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
remembered
his
first
moments
of
shrinking
.
They
were
private
,
and
*NL*
were
filled
with
arguments
;
some
of
these
taking
the
form
of
prayer
.
*NL*
The
business
was
established
and
had
old
roots
;
is
it
not
one
thing
to
*NL*
set
up
a
new
gin-palace
and
another
to
accept
an
investment
in
an
old
*NL*
one
?
The
profits
made
out
of
lost
souls
--
where
can
the
line
be
drawn
*NL*
at
which
they
begin
in
human
transactions
?
Was
it
not
even
God
's
way
*NL*
of
saving
His
chosen
?
``
Thou
knowest
,
''
--
the
young
Bulstrode
had
said
*NL*
then
,
as
the
older
Bulstrode
was
saying
now
--
``
Thou
knowest
how
loose
*NL*
my
soul
sits
from
these
things
--
how
I
view
them
all
as
implements
for
*NL*
tilling
Thy
garden
rescued
here
and
there
from
the
wilderness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Metaphors
and
precedents
were
not
wanting
;
peculiar
spiritual
*NL*
experiences
were
not
wanting
which
at
last
made
the
retention
of
his
*NL*
position
seem
a
service
demanded
of
him
:
the
vista
of
a
fortune
had
*NL*
already
opened
itself
,
and
Bulstrode
's
shrinking
remained
private
.
Mr.
*NL*
Dunkirk
had
never
expected
that
there
would
be
any
shrinking
at
all
:
he
*NL*
had
never
conceived
that
trade
had
anything
to
do
with
the
scheme
of
*NL*
salvation
.
And
it
was
true
that
Bulstrode
found
himself
carrying
on
*NL*
two
distinct
lives
;
his
religious
activity
could
not
be
incompatible
*NL*
with
his
business
as
soon
as
he
had
argued
himself
into
not
feeling
it
*NL*
incompatible
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mentally
surrounded
with
that
past
again
,
Bulstrode
had
the
same
*NL*
pleas
--
indeed
,
the
years
had
been
perpetually
spinning
them
into
*NL*
intricate
thickness
,
like
masses
of
spider-web
,
padding
the
moral
*NL*
sensibility
;
nay
,
as
age
made
egoism
more
eager
but
less
enjoying
,
his
*NL*
soul
had
become
more
saturated
with
the
belief
that
he
did
everything
*NL*
for
God
's
sake
,
being
indifferent
to
it
for
his
own
.
And
yet
--
if
he
*NL*
could
be
back
in
that
far-off
spot
with
his
youthful
poverty
--
why
,
then
*NL*
he
would
choose
to
be
a
missionary
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
train
of
causes
in
which
he
had
locked
himself
went
on
.
There
*NL*
was
trouble
in
the
fine
villa
at
Highbury
.
Years
before
,
the
only
*NL*
daughter
had
run
away
,
defied
her
parents
,
and
gone
on
the
stage
;
and
*NL*
now
the
only
boy
died
,
and
after
a
short
time
Mr.
Dunkirk
died
also
.
*NL*
The
wife
,
a
simple
pious
woman
,
left
with
all
the
wealth
in
and
out
of
*NL*
the
magnificent
trade
,
of
which
she
never
knew
the
precise
nature
,
had
*NL*
come
to
believe
in
Bulstrode
,
and
innocently
adore
him
as
women
often
*NL*
adore
their
priest
or
``
man-made
''
minister
.
It
was
natural
that
after
a
*NL*
time
marriage
should
have
been
thought
of
between
them
.
But
Mrs.
*NL*
Dunkirk
had
qualms
and
yearnings
about
her
daughter
,
who
had
long
been
*NL*
regarded
as
lost
both
to
God
and
her
parents
.
It
was
known
that
the
*NL*
daughter
had
married
,
but
she
was
utterly
gone
out
of
sight
.
The
*NL*
mother
,
having
lost
her
boy
,
imagined
a
grandson
,
and
wished
in
a
*NL*
double
sense
to
reclaim
her
daughter
.
If
she
were
found
,
there
would
*NL*
be
a
channel
for
property
--
perhaps
a
wide
one
--
in
the
provision
for
*NL*
several
grandchildren
.
Efforts
to
find
her
must
be
made
before
Mrs.
*NL*
Dunkirk
would
marry
again
.
Bulstrode
concurred
;
but
after
*NL*
advertisement
as
well
as
other
modes
of
inquiry
had
been
tried
,
the
*NL*
mother
believed
that
her
daughter
was
not
to
be
found
,
and
consented
to
*NL*
marry
without
reservation
of
property
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
daughter
had
been
found
;
but
only
one
man
besides
Bulstrode
knew
*NL*
it
,
and
he
was
paid
for
keeping
silence
and
carrying
himself
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
the
bare
fact
which
Bulstrode
was
now
forced
to
see
in
the
*NL*
rigid
outline
with
which
acts
present
themselves
onlookers
.
But
for
*NL*
himself
at
that
distant
time
,
and
even
now
in
burning
memory
,
the
fact
*NL*
was
broken
into
little
sequences
,
each
justified
as
it
came
by
*NL*
reasonings
which
seemed
to
prove
it
righteous
.
Bulstrode
's
course
up
*NL*
to
that
time
had
,
he
thought
,
been
sanctioned
by
remarkable
*NL*
providences
,
appearing
to
point
the
way
for
him
to
be
the
agent
in
*NL*
making
the
best
use
of
a
large
property
and
withdrawing
it
from
*NL*
perversion
.
Death
and
other
striking
dispositions
,
such
as
feminine
*NL*
trustfulness
,
had
come
;
and
Bulstrode
would
have
adopted
Cromwell
's
*NL*
words
--
``
Do
you
call
these
bare
events
?
The
Lord
pity
you
!
''
The
*NL*
events
were
comparatively
small
,
but
the
essential
condition
was
*NL*
there
--
namely
,
that
they
were
in
favor
of
his
own
ends
.
It
was
easy
*NL*
for
him
to
settle
what
was
due
from
him
to
others
by
inquiring
what
*NL*
were
God
's
intentions
with
regard
to
himself
.
Could
it
be
for
God
's
*NL*
service
that
this
fortune
should
in
any
considerable
proportion
go
to
a
*NL*
young
woman
and
her
husband
who
were
given
up
to
the
lightest
pursuits
,
*NL*
and
might
scatter
it
abroad
in
triviality
--
people
who
seemed
to
lie
*NL*
outside
the
path
of
remarkable
providences
?
Bulstrode
had
never
said
*NL*
to
himself
beforehand
,
``
The
daughter
shall
not
be
found
''
--
nevertheless
*NL*
when
the
moment
came
he
kept
her
existence
hidden
;
and
when
other
*NL*
moments
followed
,
he
soothed
the
mother
with
consolation
in
the
*NL*
probability
that
the
unhappy
young
woman
might
be
no
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
hours
in
which
Bulstrode
felt
that
his
action
was
*NL*
unrighteous
;
but
how
could
he
go
back
?
He
had
mental
exercises
,
called
*NL*
himself
nought
,
laid
hold
on
redemption
,
and
went
on
in
his
course
of
*NL*
instrumentality
.
And
after
five
years
Death
again
came
to
widen
his
*NL*
path
,
by
taking
away
his
wife
.
He
did
gradually
withdraw
his
capital
,
*NL*
but
he
did
not
make
the
sacrifices
requisite
to
put
an
end
to
the
*NL*
business
,
which
was
carried
on
for
thirteen
years
afterwards
before
it
*NL*
finally
collapsed
.
Meanwhile
Nicholas
Bulstrode
had
used
his
hundred
*NL*
thousand
discreetly
,
and
was
become
provincially
,
solidly
important
--
a
*NL*
banker
,
a
Churchman
,
a
public
benefactor
;
also
a
sleeping
partner
in
*NL*
trading
concerns
,
in
which
his
ability
was
directed
to
economy
in
the
*NL*
raw
material
,
as
in
the
case
of
the
dyes
which
rotted
Mr.
Vincy
's
silk
.
*NL*
And
now
,
when
this
respectability
had
lasted
undisturbed
for
nearly
*NL*
thirty
years
--
when
all
that
preceded
it
had
long
lain
benumbed
in
the
*NL*
consciousness
--
that
past
had
risen
and
immersed
his
thought
as
if
with
*NL*
the
terrible
irruption
of
a
new
sense
overburthening
the
feeble
being
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
in
his
conversation
with
Raffles
,
he
had
learned
something
*NL*
momentous
,
something
which
entered
actively
into
the
struggle
of
his
*NL*
longings
and
terrors
.
There
,
he
thought
,
lay
an
opening
towards
*NL*
spiritual
,
perhaps
towards
material
rescue
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
spiritual
kind
of
rescue
was
a
genuine
need
with
him
.
There
may
be
*NL*
coarse
hypocrites
,
who
consciously
affect
beliefs
and
emotions
for
the
*NL*
sake
of
gulling
the
world
,
but
Bulstrode
was
not
one
of
them
.
He
was
*NL*
simply
a
man
whose
desires
had
been
stronger
than
his
theoretic
*NL*
beliefs
,
and
who
had
gradually
explained
the
gratification
of
his
*NL*
desires
into
satisfactory
agreement
with
those
beliefs
.
If
this
be
*NL*
hypocrisy
,
it
is
a
process
which
shows
itself
occasionally
in
us
all
,
*NL*
to
whatever
confession
we
belong
,
and
whether
we
believe
in
the
future
*NL*
perfection
of
our
race
or
in
the
nearest
date
fixed
for
the
end
of
the
*NL*
world
;
whether
we
regard
the
earth
as
a
putrefying
nidus
for
a
saved
*NL*
remnant
,
including
ourselves
,
or
have
a
passionate
belief
in
the
*NL*
solidarity
of
mankind
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
service
he
could
do
to
the
cause
of
religion
had
been
through
life
*NL*
the
ground
he
alleged
to
himself
for
his
choice
of
action
:
it
had
been
*NL*
the
motive
which
he
had
poured
out
in
his
prayers
.
Who
would
use
money
*NL*
and
position
better
than
he
meant
to
use
them
?
Who
could
surpass
him
*NL*
in
self-abhorrence
and
exaltation
of
God
's
cause
?
And
to
Mr.
Bulstrode
*NL*
God
's
cause
was
something
distinct
from
his
own
rectitude
of
conduct
:
*NL*
it
enforced
a
discrimination
of
God
's
enemies
,
who
were
to
be
used
*NL*
merely
as
instruments
,
and
whom
it
would
be
as
well
if
possible
to
keep
*NL*
out
of
money
and
consequent
influence
.
Also
,
profitable
investments
in
*NL*
trades
where
the
power
of
the
prince
of
this
world
showed
its
most
*NL*
active
devices
,
became
sanctified
by
a
right
application
of
the
profits
*NL*
in
the
hands
of
God
's
servant
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
implicit
reasoning
is
essentially
no
more
peculiar
to
evangelical
*NL*
belief
than
the
use
of
wide
phrases
for
narrow
motives
is
peculiar
to
*NL*
Englishmen
.
There
is
no
general
doctrine
which
is
not
capable
of
*NL*
eating
out
our
morality
if
unchecked
by
the
deep-seated
habit
of
direct
*NL*
fellow-feeling
with
individual
fellow-men
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
a
man
who
believes
in
something
else
than
his
own
greed
,
has
*NL*
necessarily
a
conscience
or
standard
to
which
he
more
or
less
adapts
*NL*
himself
.
Bulstrode
's
standard
had
been
his
serviceableness
to
God
's
*NL*
cause
:
``
I
am
sinful
and
nought
--
a
vessel
to
be
consecrated
by
use
--
but
*NL*
use
me
!
''
--
had
been
the
mould
into
which
he
had
constrained
his
immense
*NL*
need
of
being
something
important
and
predominating
.
And
now
had
come
*NL*
a
moment
in
which
that
mould
seemed
in
danger
of
being
broken
and
*NL*
utterly
cast
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
if
the
acts
he
had
reconciled
himself
to
because
they
made
him
a
*NL*
stronger
instrument
of
the
divine
glory
,
were
to
become
the
pretext
of
*NL*
the
scoffer
,
and
a
darkening
of
that
glory
?
If
this
were
to
be
the
*NL*
ruling
of
Providence
,
he
was
cast
out
from
the
temple
as
one
who
had
*NL*
brought
unclean
offerings
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
long
poured
out
utterances
of
repentance
.
But
today
a
*NL*
repentance
had
come
which
was
of
a
bitterer
flavor
,
and
a
threatening
*NL*
Providence
urged
him
to
a
kind
of
propitiation
which
was
not
simply
a
*NL*
doctrinal
transaction
.
The
divine
tribunal
had
changed
its
aspect
for
*NL*
him
;
self-prostration
was
no
longer
enough
,
and
he
must
bring
*NL*
restitution
in
his
hand
.
It
was
really
before
his
God
that
Bulstrode
*NL*
was
about
to
attempt
such
restitution
as
seemed
possible
:
a
great
dread
*NL*
had
seized
his
susceptible
frame
,
and
the
scorching
approach
of
shame
*NL*
wrought
in
him
a
new
spiritual
need
.
Night
and
day
,
while
the
*NL*
resurgent
threatening
past
was
making
a
conscience
within
him
,
he
was
*NL*
thinking
by
what
means
he
could
recover
peace
and
trust
--
by
what
*NL*
sacrifice
he
could
stay
the
rod
.
His
belief
in
these
moments
of
dread
*NL*
was
,
that
if
he
spontaneously
did
something
right
,
God
would
save
him
*NL*
from
the
consequences
of
wrong-doing
.
For
religion
can
only
change
when
*NL*
the
emotions
which
fill
it
are
changed
;
and
the
religion
of
personal
*NL*
fear
remains
nearly
at
the
level
of
the
savage
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
seen
Raffles
actually
going
away
on
the
Brassing
coach
,
and
this
*NL*
was
a
temporary
relief
;
it
removed
the
pressure
of
an
immediate
dread
,
*NL*
but
did
not
put
an
end
to
the
spiritual
conflict
and
the
need
to
win
*NL*
protection
.
At
last
he
came
to
a
difficult
resolve
,
and
wrote
a
letter
*NL*
to
Will
Ladislaw
,
begging
him
to
be
at
the
Shrubs
that
evening
for
a
*NL*
private
interview
at
nine
o'clock
.
Will
had
felt
no
particular
surprise
*NL*
at
the
request
,
and
connected
it
with
some
new
notions
about
the
*NL*
``
Pioneer
;
''
but
when
he
was
shown
into
Mr.
Bulstrode
's
private
room
,
he
*NL*
was
struck
with
the
painfully
worn
look
on
the
banker
's
face
,
and
was
*NL*
going
to
say
,
``
Are
you
ill
?
''
when
,
checking
himself
in
that
abruptness
,
*NL*
he
only
inquired
after
Mrs.
Bulstrode
,
and
her
satisfaction
with
the
*NL*
picture
bought
for
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
she
is
quite
satisfied
;
she
has
gone
out
with
her
daughters
*NL*
this
evening
.
I
begged
you
to
come
,
Mr.
Ladislaw
,
because
I
have
a
*NL*
communication
of
a
very
private
--
indeed
,
I
will
say
,
of
a
sacredly
*NL*
confidential
nature
,
which
I
desire
to
make
to
you
.
Nothing
,
I
dare
*NL*
say
,
has
been
farther
from
your
thoughts
than
that
there
had
been
*NL*
important
ties
in
the
past
which
could
connect
your
history
with
mine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Will
felt
something
like
an
electric
shock
.
He
was
already
in
a
state
*NL*
of
keen
sensitiveness
and
hardly
allayed
agitation
on
the
subject
of
*NL*
ties
in
the
past
,
and
his
presentiments
were
not
agreeable
.
It
seemed
*NL*
like
the
fluctuations
of
a
dream
--
as
if
the
action
begun
by
that
loud
*NL*
bloated
stranger
were
being
carried
on
by
this
pale-eyed
sickly
looking
*NL*
piece
of
respectability
,
whose
subdued
tone
and
glib
formality
of
*NL*
speech
were
at
this
moment
almost
as
repulsive
to
him
as
their
*NL*
remembered
contrast
.
He
answered
,
with
a
marked
change
of
color
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
indeed
,
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
before
you
,
Mr.
Ladislaw
,
a
man
who
is
deeply
stricken
.
But
*NL*
for
the
urgency
of
conscience
and
the
knowledge
that
I
am
before
the
*NL*
bar
of
One
who
seeth
not
as
man
seeth
,
I
should
be
under
no
compulsion
*NL*
to
make
the
disclosure
which
has
been
my
object
in
asking
you
to
come
*NL*
here
to-night
.
So
far
as
human
laws
go
,
you
have
no
claim
on
me
*NL*
whatever
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Will
was
even
more
uncomfortable
than
wondering
.
Mr.
Bulstrode
had
*NL*
paused
,
leaning
his
head
on
his
hand
,
and
looking
at
the
floor
.
But
he
*NL*
now
fixed
his
examining
glance
on
Will
and
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
told
that
your
mother
's
name
was
Sarah
Dunkirk
,
and
that
she
ran
*NL*
away
from
her
friends
to
go
on
the
stage
.
Also
,
that
your
father
was
*NL*
at
one
time
much
emaciated
by
illness
.
May
I
ask
if
you
can
confirm
*NL*
these
statements
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
they
are
all
true
,
''
said
Will
,
struck
with
the
order
in
which
an
*NL*
inquiry
had
come
,
that
might
have
been
expected
to
be
preliminary
to
*NL*
the
banker
's
previous
hints
.
But
Mr.
Bulstrode
had
to-night
followed
*NL*
the
order
of
his
emotions
;
he
entertained
no
doubt
that
the
opportunity
*NL*
for
restitution
had
come
,
and
he
had
an
overpowering
impulse
towards
*NL*
the
penitential
expression
by
which
he
was
deprecating
chastisement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
any
particulars
of
your
mother
's
family
?
''
he
continued
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
she
never
liked
to
speak
of
them
.
She
was
a
very
generous
,
*NL*
honorable
woman
,
''
said
Will
,
almost
angrily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
wish
to
allege
anything
against
her
.
Did
she
never
mention
*NL*
her
mother
to
you
at
all
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
heard
her
say
that
she
thought
her
mother
did
not
know
the
*NL*
reason
of
her
running
away
.
She
said
`
poor
mother
'
in
a
pitying
tone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
mother
became
my
wife
,
''
said
Bulstrode
,
and
then
paused
a
moment
*NL*
before
he
added
,
``
you
have
a
claim
on
me
,
Mr.
Ladislaw
:
as
I
said
*NL*
before
,
not
a
legal
claim
,
but
one
which
my
conscience
recognizes
.
I
*NL*
was
enriched
by
that
marriage
--
a
result
which
would
probably
not
have
*NL*
taken
place
--
certainly
not
to
the
same
extent
--
if
your
grandmother
*NL*
could
have
discovered
her
daughter
.
That
daughter
,
I
gather
,
is
no
*NL*
longer
living
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Will
,
feeling
suspicion
and
repugnance
rising
so
strongly
*NL*
within
him
,
that
without
quite
knowing
what
he
did
,
he
took
his
hat
*NL*
from
the
floor
and
stood
up
.
The
impulse
within
him
was
to
reject
the
*NL*
disclosed
connection
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pray
be
seated
,
Mr.
Ladislaw
,
''
said
Bulstrode
,
anxiously
.
``
Doubtless
*NL*
you
are
startled
by
the
suddenness
of
this
discovery
.
But
I
entreat
*NL*
your
patience
with
one
who
is
already
bowed
down
by
inward
trial
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Will
reseated
himself
,
feeling
some
pity
which
was
half
contempt
for
*NL*
this
voluntary
self-abasement
of
an
elderly
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
my
wish
,
Mr.
Ladislaw
,
to
make
amends
for
the
deprivation
which
*NL*
befell
your
mother
.
I
know
that
you
are
without
fortune
,
and
I
wish
to
*NL*
supply
you
adequately
from
a
store
which
would
have
probably
already
*NL*
been
yours
had
your
grandmother
been
certain
of
your
mother
's
existence
*NL*
and
been
able
to
find
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bulstrode
paused
.
He
felt
that
he
was
performing
a
striking
piece
*NL*
of
scrupulosity
in
the
judgment
of
his
auditor
,
and
a
penitential
act
*NL*
in
the
eyes
of
God
.
He
had
no
clew
to
the
state
of
Will
Ladislaw
's
*NL*
mind
,
smarting
as
it
was
from
the
clear
hints
of
Raffles
,
and
with
its
*NL*
natural
quickness
in
construction
stimulated
by
the
expectation
of
*NL*
discoveries
which
he
would
have
been
glad
to
conjure
back
into
*NL*
darkness
.
Will
made
no
answer
for
several
moments
,
till
Mr.
Bulstrode
,
*NL*
who
at
the
end
of
his
speech
had
cast
his
eyes
on
the
floor
,
now
raised
*NL*
them
with
an
examining
glance
,
which
Will
met
fully
,
saying
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
you
did
know
of
my
mother
's
existence
,
and
knew
where
she
*NL*
might
have
been
found
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bulstrode
shrank
--
there
was
a
visible
quivering
in
his
face
and
hands
.
*NL*
He
was
totally
unprepared
to
have
his
advances
met
in
this
way
,
or
to
*NL*
find
himself
urged
into
more
revelation
than
he
had
beforehand
set
down
*NL*
as
needful
.
But
at
that
moment
he
dared
not
tell
a
lie
,
and
he
felt
*NL*
suddenly
uncertain
of
his
ground
which
he
had
trodden
with
some
*NL*
confidence
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
not
deny
that
you
conjecture
rightly
,
''
he
answered
,
with
a
*NL*
faltering
in
his
tone
.
``
And
I
wish
to
make
atonement
to
you
as
the
one
*NL*
still
remaining
who
has
suffered
a
loss
through
me
.
You
enter
,
I
*NL*
trust
,
into
my
purpose
,
Mr.
Ladislaw
,
which
has
a
reference
to
higher
*NL*
than
merely
human
claims
,
and
as
I
have
already
said
,
is
entirely
*NL*
independent
of
any
legal
compulsion
.
I
am
ready
to
narrow
my
own
*NL*
resources
and
the
prospects
of
my
family
by
binding
myself
to
allow
you
*NL*
five
hundred
pounds
yearly
during
my
life
,
and
to
leave
you
a
*NL*
proportional
capital
at
my
death
--
nay
,
to
do
still
more
,
if
more
should
*NL*
be
definitely
necessary
to
any
laudable
project
on
your
part
.
''
Mr.
*NL*
Bulstrode
had
gone
on
to
particulars
in
the
expectation
that
these
*NL*
would
work
strongly
on
Ladislaw
,
and
merge
other
feelings
in
grateful
*NL*
acceptance
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Will
was
looking
as
stubborn
as
possible
,
with
his
lip
pouting
and
*NL*
his
fingers
in
his
side-pockets
.
He
was
not
in
the
least
touched
,
and
*NL*
said
firmly
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Before
I
make
any
reply
to
your
proposition
,
Mr.
Bulstrode
,
I
must
beg
*NL*
you
to
answer
a
question
or
two
.
Were
you
connected
with
the
business
*NL*
by
which
that
fortune
you
speak
of
was
originally
made
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bulstrode
's
thought
was
,
``
Raffles
has
told
him
.
''
How
could
he
*NL*
refuse
to
answer
when
he
had
volunteered
what
drew
forth
the
question
?
*NL*
He
answered
,
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
was
that
business
--
or
was
it
not
--
a
thoroughly
dishonorable
*NL*
one
--
nay
,
one
that
,
if
its
nature
had
been
made
public
,
might
have
*NL*
ranked
those
concerned
in
it
with
thieves
and
convicts
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Will
's
tone
had
a
cutting
bitterness
:
he
was
moved
to
put
his
question
*NL*
as
nakedly
as
he
could
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bulstrode
reddened
with
irrepressible
anger
.
He
had
been
prepared
for
*NL*
a
scene
of
self-abasement
,
but
his
intense
pride
and
his
habit
of
*NL*
supremacy
overpowered
penitence
,
and
even
dread
,
when
this
young
man
,
*NL*
whom
he
had
meant
to
benefit
,
turned
on
him
with
the
air
of
a
judge
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
business
was
established
before
I
became
connected
with
it
,
sir
;
*NL*
nor
is
it
for
you
to
institute
an
inquiry
of
that
kind
,
''
he
answered
,
*NL*
not
raising
his
voice
,
but
speaking
with
quick
defiantness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
is
,
''
said
Will
,
starting
up
again
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
.
*NL*
``
It
is
eminently
mine
to
ask
such
questions
,
when
I
have
to
decide
*NL*
whether
I
will
have
transactions
with
you
and
accept
your
money
.
My
*NL*
unblemished
honor
is
important
to
me
.
It
is
important
to
me
to
have
no
*NL*
stain
on
my
birth
and
connections
.
And
now
I
find
there
is
a
stain
*NL*
which
I
ca
n't
help
.
My
mother
felt
it
,
and
tried
to
keep
as
clear
of
*NL*
it
as
she
could
,
and
so
will
I
.
You
shall
keep
your
ill-gotten
money
.
*NL*
If
I
had
any
fortune
of
my
own
,
I
would
willingly
pay
it
to
any
one
who
*NL*
could
disprove
what
you
have
told
me
.
What
I
have
to
thank
you
for
is
*NL*
that
you
kept
the
money
till
now
,
when
I
can
refuse
it
.
It
ought
to
*NL*
lie
with
a
man
's
self
that
he
is
a
gentleman
.
Good-night
,
sir

''
*NL*
*NL*
Bulstrode
was
going
to
speak
,
but
Will
,
with
determined
quickness
,
was
*NL*
out
of
the
room
in
an
instant
,
and
in
another
the
hall-door
had
closed
*NL*
behind
him
.
He
was
too
strongly
possessed
with
passionate
rebellion
*NL*
against
this
inherited
blot
which
had
been
thrust
on
his
knowledge
to
*NL*
reflect
at
present
whether
he
had
not
been
too
hard
on
Bulstrode
--
too
*NL*
arrogantly
merciless
towards
a
man
of
sixty
,
who
was
making
efforts
at
*NL*
retrieval
when
time
had
rendered
them
vain
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
third
person
listening
could
have
thoroughly
understood
the
*NL*
impetuosity
of
Will
's
repulse
or
the
bitterness
of
his
words
.
No
one
*NL*
but
himself
then
knew
how
everything
connected
with
the
sentiment
of
*NL*
his
own
dignity
had
an
immediate
bearing
for
him
on
his
relation
to
*NL*
Dorothea
and
to
Mr.
Casaubon
's
treatment
of
him
.
And
in
the
rush
of
*NL*
impulses
by
which
he
flung
back
that
offer
of
Bulstrode
's
there
was
*NL*
mingled
the
sense
that
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
him
ever
to
*NL*
tell
Dorothea
that
he
had
accepted
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
Bulstrode
--
when
Will
was
gone
he
suffered
a
violent
reaction
,
*NL*
and
wept
like
a
woman
.
It
was
the
first
time
he
had
encountered
an
*NL*
open
expression
of
scorn
from
any
man
higher
than
Raffles
;
and
with
*NL*
that
scorn
hurrying
like
venom
through
his
system
,
there
was
no
*NL*
sensibility
left
to
consolations
.
But
the
relief
of
weeping
had
to
be
*NL*
checked
.
His
wife
and
daughters
soon
came
home
from
hearing
the
*NL*
address
of
an
Oriental
missionary
,
and
were
full
of
regret
that
papa
*NL*
had
not
heard
,
in
the
first
instance
,
the
interesting
things
which
they
*NL*
tried
to
repeat
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Perhaps
,
through
all
other
hidden
thoughts
,
the
one
that
breathed
most
*NL*
comfort
was
,
that
Will
Ladislaw
at
least
was
not
likely
to
publish
what
*NL*
had
taken
place
that
evening
.

CHAPTER
LXII

*NL*
``
He

of
lowe

*NL*
That

king
's
daughter
of
Hungrie
.
*NL*
--
Old
Romance
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Will
Ladislaw
's
mind
was
now
wholly
bent
on
seeing
Dorothea
again
,
and
*NL*
forthwith
quitting
Middlemarch
.
The
morning
after
his
agitating
scene
*NL*
with
Bulstrode
he
wrote
a
brief
letter
to
her
,
saying
that
various
*NL*
causes
had
detained
him
in
the
neighborhood
longer
than
he
had
*NL*
expected
,
and
asking
her
permission
to
call
again
at
Lowick
at
some
*NL*
hour
which
she
would
mention
on
the
earliest
possible
day
,
he
being
*NL*
anxious
to
depart
,
but
unwilling
to
do
so
until
she
had
granted
him
an
*NL*
interview
.
He
left
the
letter
at
the
office
,
ordering
the
messenger
to
*NL*
carry
it
to
Lowick
Manor
,
and
wait
for
an
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ladislaw
felt
the
awkwardness
of
asking
for
more
last
words
.
His
*NL*
former
farewell
had
been
made
in
the
hearing
of
Sir
James
Chettam
,
and
*NL*
had
been
announced
as
final
even
to
the
butler
.
It
is
certainly
trying
*NL*
to
a
man
's
dignity
to
reappear
when
he
is
not
expected
to
do
so
:
a
*NL*
first
farewell
has
pathos
in
it
,
but
to
come
back
for
a
second
lends
an
*NL*
opening
to
comedy
,
and
it
was
possible
even
that
there
might
be
bitter
*NL*
sneers
afloat
about
Will
's
motives
for
lingering
.
Still
it
was
on
the
*NL*
whole
more
satisfactory
to
his
feeling
to
take
the
directest
means
of
*NL*
seeing
Dorothea
,
than
to
use
any
device
which
might
give
an
air
of
*NL*
chance
to
a
meeting
of
which
he
wished
her
to
understand
that
it
was
*NL*
what
he
earnestly
sought
.
When
he
had
parted
from
her
before
,
he
had
*NL*
been
in
ignorance
of
facts
which
gave
a
new
aspect
to
the
relation
*NL*
between
them
,
and
made
a
more
absolute
severance
than
he
had
then
*NL*
believed
in
.
He
knew
nothing
of
Dorothea
's
private
fortune
,
and
being
*NL*
little
used
to
reflect
on
such
matters
,
took
it
for
granted
that
*NL*
according
to
Mr.
Casaubon
's
arrangement
marriage
to
him
,
Will
Ladislaw
,
*NL*
would
mean
that
she
consented
to
be
penniless
.
That
was
not
what
he
*NL*
could
wish
for
even
in
his
secret
heart
,
or
even
if
she
had
been
ready
*NL*
to
meet
such
hard
contrast
for
his
sake
.
And
then
,
too
,
there
was
the
*NL*
fresh
smart
of
that
disclosure
about
his
mother
's
family
,
which
if
*NL*
known
would
be
an
added
reason
why
Dorothea
's
friends
should
look
down
*NL*
upon
him
as
utterly
below
her
.
The
secret
hope
that
after
some
years
*NL*
he
might
come
back
with
the
sense
that
he
had
at
least
a
personal
value
*NL*
equal
to
her
wealth
,
seemed
now
the
dreamy
continuation
of
a
dream
.
*NL*
This
change
would
surely
justify
him
in
asking
Dorothea
to
receive
him
*NL*
once
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Dorothea
on
that
morning
was
not
at
home
to
receive
Will
's
note
.
*NL*
In
consequence
of
a
letter
from
her
uncle
announcing
his
intention
to
*NL*
be
at
home
in
a
week
,
she
had
driven
first
to
Freshitt
to
carry
the
*NL*
news
,
meaning
to
go
on
to
the
Grange
to
deliver
some
orders
with
which
*NL*
her
uncle
had
intrusted
her
--
thinking
,
as
he
said
,
``
a
little
mental
*NL*
occupation
of
this
sort
good
for
a
widow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
If
Will
Ladislaw
could
have
overheard
some
of
the
talk
at
Freshitt
that
*NL*
morning
,
he
would
have
felt
all
his
suppositions
confirmed
as
to
the
*NL*
readiness
of
certain
people
to
sneer
at
his
lingering
in
the
*NL*
neighborhood
.
Sir
James
,
indeed
,
though
much
relieved
concerning
*NL*
Dorothea
,
had
been
on
the
watch
to
learn
Ladislaw
's
movements
,
and
had
*NL*
an
instructed
informant
in
Mr.
Standish
,
who
was
necessarily
in
his
*NL*
confidence
on
this
matter
.
That
Ladislaw
had
stayed
in
Middlemarch
*NL*
nearly
two
months
after
he
had
declared
that
he
was
going
immediately
,
*NL*
was
a
fact
to
embitter
Sir
James
's
suspicions
,
or
at
least
to
justify
*NL*
his
aversion
to
a
``
young
fellow
''
whom
he
represented
to
himself
as
*NL*
slight
,
volatile
,
and
likely
enough
to
show
such
recklessness
as
*NL*
naturally
went
along
with
a
position
unriveted
by
family
ties
or
a
*NL*
strict
profession
.
But
he
had
just
heard
something
from
Standish
*NL*
which
,
while
it
justified
these
surmises
about
Will
,
offered
a
means
of
*NL*
nullifying
all
danger
with
regard
to
Dorothea
.
*NL*
*NL*
Unwonted
circumstances
may
make
us
all
rather
unlike
ourselves
:
there
*NL*
are
conditions
under
which
the
most
majestic
person
is
obliged
to
*NL*
sneeze
,
and
our
emotions
are
liable
to
be
acted
on
in
the
same
*NL*
incongruous
manner
.
Good
Sir
James
was
this
morning
so
far
unlike
*NL*
himself
that
he
was
irritably
anxious
to
say
something
to
Dorothea
on
a
*NL*
subject
which
he
usually
avoided
as
if
it
had
been
a
matter
of
shame
to
*NL*
them
both
.
He
could
not
use
Celia
as
a
medium
,
because
he
did
not
*NL*
choose
that
she
should
know
the
kind
of
gossip
he
had
in
his
mind
;
and
*NL*
before
Dorothea
happened
to
arrive
he
had
been
trying
to
imagine
how
,
*NL*
with
his
shyness
and
unready
tongue
,
he
could
ever
manage
to
introduce
*NL*
his
communication
.
Her
unexpected
presence
brought
him
to
utter
*NL*
hopelessness
in
his
own
power
of
saying
anything
unpleasant
;
but
*NL*
desperation
suggested
a
resource
;
he
sent
the
groom
on
an
unsaddled
*NL*
horse
across
the
park
with
a
pencilled
note
to
Mrs.
Cadwallader
,
who
*NL*
already
knew
the
gossip
,
and
would
think
it
no
compromise
of
herself
to
*NL*
repeat
it
as
often
as
required
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
was
detained
on
the
good
pretext
that
Mr.
Garth
,
whom
she
*NL*
wanted
to
see
,
was
expected
at
the
hall
within
the
hour
,
and
she
was
*NL*
still
talking
to
Caleb
on
the
gravel
when
Sir
James
,
on
the
watch
for
*NL*
the
rector
's
wife
,
saw
her
coming
and
met
her
with
the
needful
hints
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Enough
!
I
understand
,
''
--
said
Mrs.
Cadwallader
.
``
You
shall
be
*NL*
innocent
.
I
am
such
a
blackamoor
that
I
can
not
smirch
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
mean
that
it
's
of
any
consequence
,
''
said
Sir
James
,
disliking
*NL*
that
Mrs.
Cadwallader
should
understand
too
much
.
``
Only
it
is
*NL*
desirable
that
Dorothea
should
know
there
are
reasons
why
she
should
*NL*
not
receive
him
again
;
and
I
really
ca
n't
say
so
to
her
.
It
will
come
*NL*
lightly
from
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
came
very
lightly
indeed
.
When
Dorothea
quitted
Caleb
and
turned
to
*NL*
meet
them
,
it
appeared
that
Mrs.
Cadwallader
had
stepped
across
the
*NL*
park
by
the
merest
chance
in
the
world
,
just
to
chat
with
Celia
in
a
*NL*
matronly
way
about
the
baby
.
And
so
Mr.
Brooke
was
coming
back
?
*NL*
Delightful
!
--
coming
back
,
it
was
to
be
hoped
,
quite
cured
of
*NL*
Parliamentary
fever
and
pioneering
.
Apropos
of
the
``
Pioneer
''
--
somebody
*NL*
had
prophesied
that
it
would
soon
be
like
a
dying
dolphin
,
and
turn
all
*NL*
colors
for
want
of
knowing
how
to
help
itself
,
because
Mr.
Brooke
's
*NL*
protege
,
the
brilliant
young
Ladislaw
,
was
gone
or
going
.
Had
Sir
*NL*
James
heard
that
?
*NL*
*NL*
The
three
were
walking
along
the
gravel
slowly
,
and
Sir
James
,
turning
*NL*
aside
to
whip
a
shrub
,
said
he
had
heard
something
of
that
sort
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
false
!
''
said
Mrs.
Cadwallader
.
``
He
is
not
gone
,
or
going
,
*NL*
apparently
;
the
`
Pioneer
'
keeps
its
color
,
and
Mr.
Orlando
Ladislaw
is
*NL*
making
a
sad
dark-blue
scandal
by
warbling
continually
with
your
Mr.
*NL*
Lydgate
's
wife
,
who
they
tell
me
is
as
pretty
as
pretty
can
be
.
It
*NL*
seems
nobody
ever
goes
into
the
house
without
finding
this
young
*NL*
gentleman
lying
on
the
rug
or
warbling
at
the
piano
.
But
the
people
in
*NL*
manufacturing
towns
are
always
disreputable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
began
by
saying
that
one
report
was
false
,
Mrs.
Cadwallader
,
and
I
*NL*
believe
this
is
false
too
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
with
indignant
energy
;
``
at
*NL*
least
,
I
feel
sure
it
is
a
misrepresentation
.
I
will
not
hear
any
evil
*NL*
spoken
of
Mr.
Ladislaw
;
he
has
already
suffered
too
much
injustice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
when
thoroughly
moved
cared
little
what
any
one
thought
of
her
*NL*
feelings
;
and
even
if
she
had
been
able
to
reflect
,
she
would
have
held
*NL*
it
petty
to
keep
silence
at
injurious
words
about
Will
from
fear
of
*NL*
being
herself
misunderstood
.
Her
face
was
flushed
and
her
lip
trembled
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
James
,
glancing
at
her
,
repented
of
his
stratagem
;
but
Mrs.
*NL*
Cadwallader
,
equal
to
all
occasions
,
spread
the
palms
of
her
hands
*NL*
outward
and
said
--
``
Heaven
grant
it
,
my
dear
!
--
I
mean
that
all
bad
tales
*NL*
about
anybody
may
be
false
.
But
it
is
a
pity
that
young
Lydgate
should
*NL*
have
married
one
of
these
Middlemarch
girls
.
Considering
he
's
a
son
of
*NL*
somebody
,
he
might
have
got
a
woman
with
good
blood
in
her
veins
,
and
*NL*
not
too
young
,
who
would
have
put
up
with
his
profession
.
There
's
*NL*
Clara
Harfager
,
for
instance
,
whose
friends
do
n't
know
what
to
do
with
*NL*
her
;
and
she
has
a
portion
.
Then
we
might
have
had
her
among
us
.
*NL*
However
!
--
it
's
no
use
being
wise
for
other
people
.
Where
is
Celia
?
*NL*
Pray
let
us
go
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
going
on
immediately
to
Tipton
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
rather
haughtily
.
*NL*
``
Good-by
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
James
could
say
nothing
as
he
accompanied
her
to
the
carriage
.
He
*NL*
was
altogether
discontented
with
the
result
of
a
contrivance
which
had
*NL*
cost
him
some
secret
humiliation
beforehand
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
drove
along
between
the
berried
hedgerows
and
the
shorn
*NL*
corn-fields
,
not
seeing
or
hearing
anything
around
.
The
tears
came
and
*NL*
rolled
down
her
cheeks
,
but
she
did
not
know
it
.
The
world
,
it
seemed
,
*NL*
was
turning
ugly
and
hateful
,
and
there
was
no
place
for
her
*NL*
trustfulness
.
``
It
is
not
true
--
it
is
not
true
!
''
was
the
voice
within
*NL*
her
that
she
listened
to
;
but
all
the
while
a
remembrance
to
which
*NL*
there
had
always
clung
a
vague
uneasiness
would
thrust
itself
on
her
*NL*
attention
--
the
remembrance
of
that
day
when
she
had
found
Will
Ladislaw
*NL*
with
Mrs.
Lydgate
,
and
had
heard
his
voice
accompanied
by
the
piano
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
said
he
would
never
do
anything
that
I
disapproved
--
I
wish
I
could
*NL*
have
told
him
that
I
disapproved
of
that
,
''
said
poor
Dorothea
,
*NL*
inwardly
,
feeling
a
strange
alternation
between
anger
with
Will
and
the
*NL*
passionate
defence
of
him
.
``
They
all
try
to
blacken
him
before
me
;
but
*NL*
I
will
care
for
no
pain
,
if
he
is
not
to
blame
.
I
always
believed
he
*NL*
was
good
.
''
--
These
were
her
last
thoughts
before
she
felt
that
the
*NL*
carriage
was
passing
under
the
archway
of
the
lodge-gate
at
the
Grange
,
*NL*
when
she
hurriedly
pressed
her
handkerchief
to
her
face
and
began
to
*NL*
think
of
her
errands
.
The
coachman
begged
leave
to
take
out
the
horses
*NL*
for
half
an
hour
as
there
was
something
wrong
with
a
shoe
;
and
*NL*
Dorothea
,
having
the
sense
that
she
was
going
to
rest
,
took
off
her
*NL*
gloves
and
bonnet
,
while
she
was
leaning
against
a
statue
in
the
*NL*
entrance-hall
,
and
talking
to
the
housekeeper
.
At
last
she
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
stay
here
a
little
,
Mrs.
Kell
.
I
will
go
into
the
library
and
*NL*
write
you
some
memoranda
from
my
uncle
's
letter
,
if
you
will
open
the
*NL*
shutters
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
shutters
are
open
,
madam
,
''
said
Mrs.
Kell
,
following
Dorothea
,
who
*NL*
had
walked
along
as
she
spoke
.
``
Mr.
Ladislaw
is
there
,
looking
for
*NL*
something
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
Will
had
come
to
fetch
a
portfolio
of
his
own
sketches
which
he
had
*NL*
missed
in
the
act
of
packing
his
movables
,
and
did
not
choose
to
leave
*NL*
behind
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
's
heart
seemed
to
turn
over
as
if
it
had
had
a
blow
,
but
she
*NL*
was
not
perceptibly
checked
:
in
truth
,
the
sense
that
Will
was
there
*NL*
was
for
the
moment
all-satisfying
to
her
,
like
the
sight
of
something
*NL*
precious
that
one
has
lost
.
When
she
reached
the
door
she
said
to
Mrs.
*NL*
Kell
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
in
first
,
and
tell
him
that
I
am
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Will
had
found
his
portfolio
,
and
had
laid
it
on
the
table
at
the
far
*NL*
end
of
the
room
,
to
turn
over
the
sketches
and
please
himself
by
*NL*
looking
at
the
memorable
piece
of
art
which
had
a
relation
to
nature
*NL*
too
mysterious
for
Dorothea
.
He
was
smiling
at
it
still
,
and
shaking
*NL*
the
sketches
into
order
with
the
thought
that
he
might
find
a
letter
*NL*
from
her
awaiting
him
at
Middlemarch
,
when
Mrs.
Kell
close
to
his
elbow
*NL*
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mrs.
Casaubon
is
coming
in
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Will
turned
round
quickly
,
and
the
next
moment
Dorothea
was
entering
.
*NL*
As
Mrs.
Kell
closed
the
door
behind
her
they
met
:
each
was
looking
at
*NL*
the
other
,
and
consciousness
was
overflowed
by
something
that
*NL*
suppressed
utterance
.
It
was
not
confusion
that
kept
them
silent
,
for
*NL*
they
both
felt
that
parting
was
near
,
and
there
is
no
shamefacedness
in
*NL*
a
sad
parting
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
moved
automatically
towards
her
uncle
's
chair
against
the
*NL*
writing-table
,
and
Will
,
after
drawing
it
out
a
little
for
her
,
went
a
*NL*
few
paces
off
and
stood
opposite
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pray
sit
down
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
crossing
her
hands
on
her
lap
;
``
I
am
*NL*
very
glad
you
were
here
.
''
Will
thought
that
her
face
looked
just
as
it
*NL*
did
when
she
first
shook
hands
with
him
in
Rome
;
for
her
widow
's
cap
,
*NL*
fixed
in
her
bonnet
,
had
gone
off
with
it
,
and
he
could
see
that
she
*NL*
had
lately
been
shedding
tears
.
But
the
mixture
of
anger
in
her
*NL*
agitation
had
vanished
at
the
sight
of
him
;
she
had
been
used
,
when
*NL*
they
were
face
to
face
,
always
to
feel
confidence
and
the
happy
freedom
*NL*
which
comes
with
mutual
understanding
,
and
how
could
other
people
's
*NL*
words
hinder
that
effect
on
a
sudden
?
Let
the
music
which
can
take
*NL*
possession
of
our
frame
and
fill
the
air
with
joy
for
us
,
sound
once
*NL*
more
--
what
does
it
signify
that
we
heard
it
found
fault
with
in
its
*NL*
absence
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
sent
a
letter
to
Lowick
Manor
to-day
,
asking
leave
to
see
you
,
''
*NL*
said
Will
,
seating
himself
opposite
to
her
.
``
I
am
going
away
*NL*
immediately
,
and
I
could
not
go
without
speaking
to
you
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
we
had
parted
when
you
came
to
Lowick
many
weeks
ago
--
you
*NL*
thought
you
were
going
then
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
her
voice
trembling
a
*NL*
little
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
but
I
was
in
ignorance
then
of
things
which
I
know
now
--
things
*NL*
which
have
altered
my
feelings
about
the
future
.
When
I
saw
you
*NL*
before
,
I
was
dreaming
that
I
might
come
back
some
day
.
I
do
n't
think
*NL*
I
ever
shall
--
now
.
''
Will
paused
here
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
wished
me
to
know
the
reasons
?
''
said
Dorothea
,
timidly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Will
,
impetuously
,
shaking
his
head
backward
,
and
looking
*NL*
away
from
her
with
irritation
in
his
face
.
``
Of
course
I
must
wish
it
.
*NL*
I
have
been
grossly
insulted
in
your
eyes
and
in
the
eyes
of
others
.
*NL*
There
has
been
a
mean
implication
against
my
character
.
I
wish
you
to
*NL*
know
that
under
no
circumstances
would
I
have
lowered
myself
by
--
under
*NL*
no
circumstances
would
I
have
given
men
the
chance
of
saying
that
I
*NL*
sought
money
under
the
pretext
of
seeking
--
something
else
.
There
was
*NL*
no
need
of
other
safeguard
against
me
--
the
safeguard
of
wealth
was
*NL*
enough
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Will
rose
from
his
chair
with
the
last
word
and
went
--
he
hardly
knew
*NL*
where
;
but
it
was
to
the
projecting
window
nearest
him
,
which
had
been
*NL*
open
as
now
about
the
same
season
a
year
ago
,
when
he
and
Dorothea
had
*NL*
stood
within
it
and
talked
together
.
Her
whole
heart
was
going
out
at
*NL*
this
moment
in
sympathy
with
Will
's
indignation
:
she
only
wanted
to
*NL*
convince
him
that
she
had
never
done
him
injustice
,
and
he
seemed
to
*NL*
have
turned
away
from
her
as
if
she
too
had
been
part
of
the
unfriendly
*NL*
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
be
very
unkind
of
you
to
suppose
that
I
ever
attributed
any
*NL*
meanness
to
you
,
''
she
began
.
Then
in
her
ardent
way
,
wanting
to
plead
*NL*
with
him
,
she
moved
from
her
chair
and
went
in
front
of
him
to
her
old
*NL*
place
in
the
window
,
saying
,
``
Do
you
suppose
that
I
ever
disbelieved
in
*NL*
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
Will
saw
her
there
,
he
gave
a
start
and
moved
backward
out
of
the
*NL*
window
,
without
meeting
her
glance
.
Dorothea
was
hurt
by
this
movement
*NL*
following
up
the
previous
anger
of
his
tone
.
She
was
ready
to
say
that
*NL*
it
was
as
hard
on
her
as
on
him
,
and
that
she
was
helpless
;
but
those
*NL*
strange
particulars
of
their
relation
which
neither
of
them
could
*NL*
explicitly
mention
kept
her
always
in
dread
of
saying
too
much
.
At
*NL*
this
moment
she
had
no
belief
that
Will
would
in
any
case
have
wanted
*NL*
to
marry
her
,
and
she
feared
using
words
which
might
imply
such
a
*NL*
belief
.
She
only
said
earnestly
,
recurring
to
his
last
word
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sure
no
safeguard
was
ever
needed
against
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Will
did
not
answer
.
In
the
stormy
fluctuation
of
his
feelings
these
*NL*
words
of
hers
seemed
to
him
cruelly
neutral
,
and
he
looked
pale
and
*NL*
miserable
after
his
angry
outburst
.
He
went
to
the
table
and
fastened
*NL*
up
his
portfolio
,
while
Dorothea
looked
at
him
from
the
distance
.
They
*NL*
were
wasting
these
last
moments
together
in
wretched
silence
.
What
*NL*
could
he
say
,
since
what
had
got
obstinately
uppermost
in
his
mind
was
*NL*
the
passionate
love
for
her
which
he
forbade
himself
to
utter
?
What
*NL*
could
she
say
,
since
she
might
offer
him
no
help
--
since
she
was
forced
*NL*
to
keep
the
money
that
ought
to
have
been
his
?
--
since
to-day
he
seemed
*NL*
not
to
respond
as
he
used
to
do
to
her
thorough
trust
and
liking
?
*NL*
*NL*
But
Will
at
last
turned
away
from
his
portfolio
and
approached
the
*NL*
window
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
go
,
''
he
said
,
with
that
peculiar
look
of
the
eyes
which
*NL*
sometimes
accompanies
bitter
feeling
,
as
if
they
had
been
tired
and
*NL*
burned
with
gazing
too
close
at
a
light
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
shall
you
do
in
life
?
''
said
Dorothea
,
timidly
.
``
Have
your
*NL*
intentions
remained
just
the
same
as
when
we
said
good-by
before
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Will
,
in
a
tone
that
seemed
to
waive
the
subject
as
*NL*
uninteresting
.
``
I
shall
work
away
at
the
first
thing
that
offers
.
I
*NL*
suppose
one
gets
a
habit
of
doing
without
happiness
or
hope
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
what
sad
words
!
''
said
Dorothea
,
with
a
dangerous
tendency
to
sob
.
*NL*
Then
trying
to
smile
,
she
added
,
``
We
used
to
agree
that
we
were
alike
*NL*
in
speaking
too
strongly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
not
spoken
too
strongly
now
,
''
said
Will
,
leaning
back
against
*NL*
the
angle
of
the
wall
.
``
There
are
certain
things
which
a
man
can
only
*NL*
go
through
once
in
his
life
;
and
he
must
know
some
time
or
other
that
*NL*
the
best
is
over
with
him
.
This
experience
has
happened
to
me
while
I
*NL*
am
very
young
--
that
is
all
.
What
I
care
more
for
than
I
can
ever
care
*NL*
for
anything
else
is
absolutely
forbidden
to
me
--
I
do
n't
mean
merely
*NL*
by
being
out
of
my
reach
,
but
forbidden
me
,
even
if
it
were
within
my
*NL*
reach
,
by
my
own
pride
and
honor
--
by
everything
I
respect
myself
for
.
*NL*
Of
course
I
shall
go
on
living
as
a
man
might
do
who
had
seen
heaven
in
*NL*
a
trance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Will
paused
,
imagining
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
Dorothea
to
*NL*
misunderstand
this
;
indeed
he
felt
that
he
was
contradicting
himself
*NL*
and
offending
against
his
self-approval
in
speaking
to
her
so
plainly
;
*NL*
but
still
--
it
could
not
be
fairly
called
wooing
a
woman
to
tell
her
*NL*
that
he
would
never
woo
her
.
It
must
be
admitted
to
be
a
ghostly
kind
*NL*
of
wooing
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Dorothea
's
mind
was
rapidly
going
over
the
past
with
quite
another
*NL*
vision
than
his
.
The
thought
that
she
herself
might
be
what
Will
most
*NL*
cared
for
did
throb
through
her
an
instant
,
but
then
came
doubt
:
the
*NL*
memory
of
the
little
they
had
lived
through
together
turned
pale
and
*NL*
shrank
before
the
memory
which
suggested
how
much
fuller
might
have
*NL*
been
the
intercourse
between
Will
and
some
one
else
with
whom
he
had
*NL*
had
constant
companionship
.
Everything
he
had
said
might
refer
to
that
*NL*
other
relation
,
and
whatever
had
passed
between
him
and
herself
was
*NL*
thoroughly
explained
by
what
she
had
always
regarded
as
their
simple
*NL*
friendship
and
the
cruel
obstruction
thrust
upon
it
by
her
husband
's
*NL*
injurious
act
.
Dorothea
stood
silent
,
with
her
eyes
cast
down
*NL*
dreamily
,
while
images
crowded
upon
her
which
left
the
sickening
*NL*
certainty
that
Will
was
referring
to
Mrs.
Lydgate
.
But
why
sickening
?
*NL*
He
wanted
her
to
know
that
here
too
his
conduct
should
be
above
*NL*
suspicion
.
*NL*
*NL*
Will
was
not
surprised
at
her
silence
.
His
mind
also
was
tumultuously
*NL*
busy
while
he
watched
her
,
and
he
was
feeling
rather
wildly
that
*NL*
something
must
happen
to
hinder
their
parting
--
some
miracle
,
clearly
*NL*
nothing
in
their
own
deliberate
speech
.
Yet
,
after
all
,
had
she
any
*NL*
love
for
him
?
--
he
could
not
pretend
to
himself
that
he
would
rather
*NL*
believe
her
to
be
without
that
pain
.
He
could
not
deny
that
a
secret
*NL*
longing
for
the
assurance
that
she
loved
him
was
at
the
root
of
all
his
*NL*
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
Neither
of
them
knew
how
long
they
stood
in
that
way
.
Dorothea
was
*NL*
raising
her
eyes
,
and
was
about
to
speak
,
when
the
door
opened
and
her
*NL*
footman
came
to
say
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
horses
are
ready
,
madam
,
whenever
you
like
to
start
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Presently
,
''
said
Dorothea
.
Then
turning
to
Will
,
she
said
,
``
I
have
*NL*
some
memoranda
to
write
for
the
housekeeper
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
go
,
''
said
Will
,
when
the
door
had
closed
again
--
advancing
*NL*
towards
her
.
``
The
day
after
to-morrow
I
shall
leave
Middlemarch
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
acted
in
every
way
rightly
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
in
a
low
tone
,
*NL*
feeling
a
pressure
at
her
heart
which
made
it
difficult
to
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
put
out
her
hand
,
and
Will
took
it
for
an
instant
without
speaking
,
*NL*
for
her
words
had
seemed
to
him
cruelly
cold
and
unlike
herself
.
Their
*NL*
eyes
met
,
but
there
was
discontent
in
his
,
and
in
hers
there
was
only
*NL*
sadness
.
He
turned
away
and
took
his
portfolio
under
his
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
never
done
you
injustice
.
Please
remember
me
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
*NL*
repressing
a
rising
sob
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
should
you
say
that
?
''
said
Will
,
with
irritation
.
``
As
if
I
were
*NL*
not
in
danger
of
forgetting
everything
else
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
really
a
movement
of
anger
against
her
at
that
moment
,
and
it
*NL*
impelled
him
to
go
away
without
pause
.
It
was
all
one
flash
to
*NL*
Dorothea
--
his
last
words
--
his
distant
bow
to
her
as
he
reached
the
*NL*
door
--
the
sense
that
he
was
no
longer
there
.
She
sank
into
the
chair
,
*NL*
and
for
a
few
moments
sat
like
a
statue
,
while
images
and
emotions
were
*NL*
hurrying
upon
her
.
Joy
came
first
,
in
spite
of
the
threatening
train
*NL*
behind
it
--
joy
in
the
impression
that
it
was
really
herself
whom
Will
*NL*
loved
and
was
renouncing
,
that
there
was
really
no
other
love
less
*NL*
permissible
,
more
blameworthy
,
which
honor
was
hurrying
him
away
from
.
*NL*
They
were
parted
all
the
same
,
but
--
Dorothea
drew
a
deep
breath
and
*NL*
felt
her
strength
return
--
she
could
think
of
him
unrestrainedly
.
At
*NL*
that
moment
the
parting
was
easy
to
bear
:
the
first
sense
of
loving
and
*NL*
being
loved
excluded
sorrow
.
It
was
as
if
some
hard
icy
pressure
had
*NL*
melted
,
and
her
consciousness
had
room
to
expand
:
her
past
was
come
*NL*
back
to
her
with
larger
interpretation
.
The
joy
was
not
the
*NL*
less
--
perhaps
it
was
the
more
complete
just
then
--
because
of
the
*NL*
irrevocable
parting
;
for
there
was
no
reproach
,
no
contemptuous
wonder
*NL*
to
imagine
in
any
eye
or
from
any
lips
.
He
had
acted
so
as
to
defy
*NL*
reproach
,
and
make
wonder
respectful
.
*NL*
*NL*
Any
one
watching
her
might
have
seen
that
there
was
a
fortifying
*NL*
thought
within
her
.
Just
as
when
inventive
power
is
working
with
glad
*NL*
ease
some
small
claim
on
the
attention
is
fully
met
as
if
it
were
only
*NL*
a
cranny
opened
to
the
sunlight
,
it
was
easy
now
for
Dorothea
to
write
*NL*
her
memoranda
.
She
spoke
her
last
words
to
the
housekeeper
in
cheerful
*NL*
tones
,
and
when
she
seated
herself
in
the
carriage
her
eyes
were
bright
*NL*
and
her
cheeks
blooming
under
the
dismal
bonnet
.
She
threw
back
the
*NL*
heavy
``
weepers
,
''
and
looked
before
her
,
wondering
which
road
Will
had
*NL*
taken
.
It
was
in
her
nature
to
be
proud
that
he
was
blameless
,
and
*NL*
through
all
her
feelings
there
ran
this
vein
--
``
I
was
right
to
defend
*NL*
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
coachman
was
used
to
drive
his
grays
at
a
good
pace
,
Mr.
Casaubon
*NL*
being
unenjoying
and
impatient
in
everything
away
from
his
desk
,
and
*NL*
wanting
to
get
to
the
end
of
all
journeys
;
and
Dorothea
was
now
bowled
*NL*
along
quickly
.
Driving
was
pleasant
,
for
rain
in
the
night
had
laid
*NL*
the
dust
,
and
the
blue
sky
looked
far
off
,
away
from
the
region
of
the
*NL*
great
clouds
that
sailed
in
masses
.
The
earth
looked
like
a
happy
*NL*
place
under
the
vast
heavens
,
and
Dorothea
was
wishing
that
she
might
*NL*
overtake
Will
and
see
him
once
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
turn
of
the
road
,
there
he
was
with
the
portfolio
under
his
*NL*
arm
;
but
the
next
moment
she
was
passing
him
while
he
raised
his
hat
,
*NL*
and
she
felt
a
pang
at
being
seated
there
in
a
sort
of
exaltation
,
*NL*
leaving
him
behind
.
She
could
not
look
back
at
him
.
It
was
as
if
a
*NL*
crowd
of
indifferent
objects
had
thrust
them
asunder
,
and
forced
them
*NL*
along
different
paths
,
taking
them
farther
and
farther
away
from
each
*NL*
other
,
and
making
it
useless
to
look
back
.
She
could
no
more
make
any
*NL*
sign
that
would
seem
to
say
,
``
Need
we
part
?
''
than
she
could
stop
the
*NL*
carriage
to
wait
for
him
.
Nay
,
what
a
world
of
reasons
crowded
upon
*NL*
her
against
any
movement
of
her
thought
towards
a
future
that
might
*NL*
reverse
the
decision
of
this
day
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
only
wish
I
had
known
before
--
I
wish
he
knew
--
then
we
could
be
quite
*NL*
happy
in
thinking
of
each
other
,
though
we
are
forever
parted
.
And
if
*NL*
I
could
but
have
given
him
the
money
,
and
made
things
easier
for
*NL*
him
!
''
--
were
the
longings
that
came
back
the
most
persistently
.
And
*NL*
yet
,
so
heavily
did
the
world
weigh
on
her
in
spite
of
her
independent
*NL*
energy
,
that
with
this
idea
of
Will
as
in
need
of
such
help
and
at
a
*NL*
disadvantage
with
the
world
,
there
came
always
the
vision
of
that
*NL*
unfittingness
of
any
closer
relation
between
them
which
lay
in
the
*NL*
opinion
of
every
one
connected
with
her
.
She
felt
to
the
full
all
the
*NL*
imperativeness
of
the
motives
which
urged
Will
's
conduct
.
How
could
he
*NL*
dream
of
her
defying
the
barrier
that
her
husband
had
placed
between
*NL*
them
?
--
how
could
she
ever
say
to
herself
that
she
would
defy
it
?
*NL*
*NL*
Will
's
certainty
as
the
carriage
grew
smaller
in
the
distance
,
had
much
*NL*
more
bitterness
in
it
.
Very
slight
matters
were
enough
to
gall
him
in
*NL*
his
sensitive
mood
,
and
the
sight
of
Dorothea
driving
past
him
while
he
*NL*
felt
himself
plodding
along
as
a
poor
devil
seeking
a
position
in
a
*NL*
world
which
in
his
present
temper
offered
him
little
that
he
coveted
,
*NL*
made
his
conduct
seem
a
mere
matter
of
necessity
,
and
took
away
the
*NL*
sustainment
of
resolve
.
After
all
,
he
had
no
assurance
that
she
loved
*NL*
him
:
could
any
man
pretend
that
he
was
simply
glad
in
such
a
case
to
*NL*
have
the
suffering
all
on
his
own
side
?
*NL*
*NL*
That
evening
Will
spent
with
the
Lydgates
;
the
next
evening
he
was
gone
.

*NL*
``
Have
you
seen
much
of
your
scientific
phoenix
,
Lydgate
,
lately
?
''
said
*NL*
Mr.
Toller
at
one
of
his
Christmas
dinner-parties
,
speaking
to
Mr.
*NL*
Farebrother
on
his
right
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
much
,
I
am
sorry
to
say
,
''
answered
the
Vicar
,
accustomed
to
parry
*NL*
Mr.
Toller
's
banter
about
his
belief
in
the
new
medical
light
.
``
I
am
*NL*
out
of
the
way
and
he
is
too
busy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
he
?
I
am
glad
to
hear
it
,
''
said
Dr.
Minchin
,
with
mingled
suavity
*NL*
and
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
gives
a
great
deal
of
time
to
the
New
Hospital
,
''
said
Mr.
*NL*
Farebrother
,
who
had
his
reasons
for
continuing
the
subject
:
``
I
hear
of
*NL*
that
from
my
neighbor
,
Mrs.
Casaubon
,
who
goes
there
often
.
She
says
*NL*
Lydgate
is
indefatigable
,
and
is
making
a
fine
thing
of
Bulstrode
's
*NL*
institution
.
He
is
preparing
a
new
ward
in
case
of
the
cholera
coming
*NL*
to
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
preparing
theories
of
treatment
to
try
on
the
patients
,
I
*NL*
suppose
,
''
said
Mr.
Toller
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
Toller
,
be
candid
,
''
said
Mr.
Farebrother
.
``
You
are
too
clever
*NL*
not
to
see
the
good
of
a
bold
fresh
mind
in
medicine
,
as
well
as
in
*NL*
everything
else
;
and
as
to
cholera
,
I
fancy
,
none
of
you
are
very
sure
*NL*
what
you
ought
to
do
.
If
a
man
goes
a
little
too
far
along
a
new
road
,
*NL*
it
is
usually
himself
that
he
harms
more
than
any
one
else
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sure
you
and
Wrench
ought
to
be
obliged
to
him
,
''
said
Dr.
*NL*
Minchin
,
looking
towards
Toller
,
``
for
he
has
sent
you
the
cream
of
*NL*
Peacock
's
patients
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lydgate
has
been
living
at
a
great
rate
for
a
young
beginner
,
''
said
*NL*
Mr.
Harry
Toller
,
the
brewer
.
``
I
suppose
his
relations
in
the
North
*NL*
back
him
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
so
,
''
said
Mr.
Chichely
,
``
else
he
ought
not
to
have
married
that
*NL*
nice
girl
we
were
all
so
fond
of
.
Hang
it
,
one
has
a
grudge
against
a
*NL*
man
who
carries
off
the
prettiest
girl
in
the
town
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
by
God
!
and
the
best
too
,
''
said
Mr.
Standish
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
friend
Vincy
did
n't
half
like
the
marriage
,
I
know
that
,
''
said
Mr.
*NL*
Chichely
.
''
_
He
_
would
n't
do
much
.
How
the
relations
on
the
other
side
*NL*
may
have
come
down
I
ca
n't
say
.
''
There
was
an
emphatic
kind
of
*NL*
reticence
in
Mr.
Chichely
's
manner
of
speaking
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
should
n't
think
Lydgate
ever
looked
to
practice
for
a
living
,
''
*NL*
said
Mr.
Toller
,
with
a
slight
touch
of
sarcasm
,
and
there
the
subject
*NL*
was
dropped
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
not
the
first
time
that
Mr.
Farebrother
had
heard
hints
of
*NL*
Lydgate
's
expenses
being
obviously
too
great
to
be
met
by
his
practice
,
*NL*
but
he
thought
it
not
unlikely
that
there
were
resources
or
*NL*
expectations
which
excused
the
large
outlay
at
the
time
of
Lydgate
's
*NL*
marriage
,
and
which
might
hinder
any
bad
consequences
from
the
*NL*
disappointment
in
his
practice
.
One
evening
,
when
he
took
the
pains
to
*NL*
go
to
Middlemarch
on
purpose
to
have
a
chat
with
Lydgate
as
of
old
,
he
*NL*
noticed
in
him
an
air
of
excited
effort
quite
unlike
his
usual
easy
way
*NL*
of
keeping
silence
or
breaking
it
with
abrupt
energy
whenever
he
had
*NL*
anything
to
say
.
Lydgate
talked
persistently
when
they
were
in
his
*NL*
work-room
,
putting
arguments
for
and
against
the
probability
of
certain
*NL*
biological
views
;
but
he
had
none
of
those
definite
things
to
say
or
to
*NL*
show
which
give
the
waymarks
of
a
patient
uninterrupted
pursuit
,
such
*NL*
as
he
used
himself
to
insist
on
,
saying
that
``
there
must
be
a
systole
*NL*
and
diastole
in
all
inquiry
,
''
and
that
``
a
man
's
mind
must
be
*NL*
continually
expanding
and
shrinking
between
the
whole
human
horizon
and
*NL*
the
horizon
of
an
object-glass
.
''
That
evening
he
seemed
to
be
talking
*NL*
widely
for
the
sake
of
resisting
any
personal
bearing
;
and
before
long
*NL*
they
went
into
the
drawing
room
,
where
Lydgate
,
having
asked
Rosamond
*NL*
to
give
them
music
,
sank
back
in
his
chair
in
silence
,
but
with
a
*NL*
strange
light
in
his
eyes
.
``
He
may
have
been
taking
an
opiate
,
''
was
a
*NL*
thought
that
crossed
Mr.
Farebrother
's
mind
--
``
tic-douloureux
*NL*
perhaps
--
or
medical
worries
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
did
not
occur
to
him
that
Lydgate
's
marriage
was
not
delightful
:
he
*NL*
believed
,
as
the
rest
did
,
that
Rosamond
was
an
amiable
,
docile
*NL*
creature
,
though
he
had
always
thought
her
rather
uninteresting
--
a
*NL*
little
too
much
the
pattern-card
of
the
finishing-school
;
and
his
*NL*
mother
could
not
forgive
Rosamond
because
she
never
seemed
to
see
that
*NL*
Henrietta
Noble
was
in
the
room
.
``
However
,
Lydgate
fell
in
love
with
*NL*
her
,
''
said
the
Vicar
to
himself
,
``
and
she
must
be
to
his
taste
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Farebrother
was
aware
that
Lydgate
was
a
proud
man
,
but
having
very
*NL*
little
corresponding
fibre
in
himself
,
and
perhaps
too
little
care
*NL*
about
personal
dignity
,
except
the
dignity
of
not
being
mean
or
*NL*
foolish
,
he
could
hardly
allow
enough
for
the
way
in
which
Lydgate
*NL*
shrank
,
as
from
a
burn
,
from
the
utterance
of
any
word
about
his
*NL*
private
affairs
.
And
soon
after
that
conversation
at
Mr.
Toller
's
,
the
*NL*
Vicar
learned
something
which
made
him
watch
the
more
eagerly
for
an
*NL*
opportunity
of
indirectly
letting
Lydgate
know
that
if
he
wanted
to
*NL*
open
himself
about
any
difficulty
there
was
a
friendly
ear
ready
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
opportunity
came
at
Mr.
Vincy
's
,
where
,
on
New
Year
's
Day
,
there
*NL*
was
a
party
,
to
which
Mr.
Farebrother
was
irresistibly
invited
,
on
the
*NL*
plea
that
he
must
not
forsake
his
old
friends
on
the
first
new
year
of
*NL*
his
being
a
greater
man
,
and
Rector
as
well
as
Vicar
.
And
this
party
*NL*
was
thoroughly
friendly
:
all
the
ladies
of
the
Farebrother
family
were
*NL*
present
;
the
Vincy
children
all
dined
at
the
table
,
and
Fred
had
*NL*
persuaded
his
mother
that
if
she
did
not
invite
Mary
Garth
,
the
*NL*
Farebrothers
would
regard
it
as
a
slight
to
themselves
,
Mary
being
*NL*
their
particular
friend
.
Mary
came
,
and
Fred
was
in
high
spirits
,
*NL*
though
his
enjoyment
was
of
a
checkered
kind
--
triumph
that
his
mother
*NL*
should
see
Mary
's
importance
with
the
chief
personages
in
the
party
*NL*
being
much
streaked
with
jealousy
when
Mr.
Farebrother
sat
down
by
her
.
*NL*
Fred
used
to
be
much
more
easy
about
his
own
accomplishments
in
the
*NL*
days
when
he
had
not
begun
to
dread
being
``
bowled
out
by
Farebrother
,
''
*NL*
and
this
terror
was
still
before
him
.
Mrs.
Vincy
,
in
her
fullest
*NL*
matronly
bloom
,
looked
at
Mary
's
little
figure
,
rough
wavy
hair
,
and
*NL*
visage
quite
without
lilies
and
roses
,
and
wondered
;
trying
*NL*
unsuccessfully
to
fancy
herself
caring
about
Mary
's
appearance
in
*NL*
wedding
clothes
,
or
feeling
complacency
in
grandchildren
who
would
*NL*
``
feature
''
the
Garths
.
However
,
the
party
was
a
merry
one
,
and
Mary
was
*NL*
particularly
bright
;
being
glad
,
for
Fred
's
sake
,
that
his
friends
were
*NL*
getting
kinder
to
her
,
and
being
also
quite
willing
that
they
should
*NL*
see
how
much
she
was
valued
by
others
whom
they
must
admit
to
be
judges
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Farebrother
noticed
that
Lydgate
seemed
bored
,
and
that
Mr.
Vincy
*NL*
spoke
as
little
as
possible
to
his
son-in-law
.
Rosamond
was
perfectly
*NL*
graceful
and
calm
,
and
only
a
subtle
observation
such
as
the
Vicar
had
*NL*
not
been
roused
to
bestow
on
her
would
have
perceived
the
total
absence
*NL*
of
that
interest
in
her
husband
's
presence
which
a
loving
wife
is
sure
*NL*
to
betray
,
even
if
etiquette
keeps
her
aloof
from
him
.
When
Lydgate
*NL*
was
taking
part
in
the
conversation
,
she
never
looked
towards
him
any
*NL*
more
than
if
she
had
been
a
sculptured
Psyche
modelled
to
look
another
*NL*
way
:
and
when
,
after
being
called
out
for
an
hour
or
two
,
he
re-entered
*NL*
the
room
,
she
seemed
unconscious
of
the
fact
,
which
eighteen
months
*NL*
before
would
have
had
the
effect
of
a
numeral
before
ciphers
.
In
*NL*
reality
,
however
,
she
was
intensely
aware
of
Lydgate
's
voice
and
*NL*
movements
;
and
her
pretty
good-tempered
air
of
unconsciousness
was
a
*NL*
studied
negation
by
which
she
satisfied
her
inward
opposition
to
him
*NL*
without
compromise
of
propriety
.
When
the
ladies
were
in
the
*NL*
drawing-room
after
Lydgate
had
been
called
away
from
the
dessert
,
Mrs.
*NL*
Farebrother
,
when
Rosamond
happened
to
be
near
her
,
said
--
``
You
have
to
*NL*
give
up
a
great
deal
of
your
husband
's
society
,
Mrs.
Lydgate
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
the
life
of
a
medical
man
is
very
arduous
:
especially
when
he
is
*NL*
so
devoted
to
his
profession
as
Mr.
Lydgate
is
,
''
said
Rosamond
,
who
was
*NL*
standing
,
and
moved
easily
away
at
the
end
of
this
correct
little
*NL*
speech
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
dreadfully
dull
for
her
when
there
is
no
company
,
''
said
Mrs.
*NL*
Vincy
,
who
was
seated
at
the
old
lady
's
side
.
``
I
am
sure
I
thought
so
*NL*
when
Rosamond
was
ill
,
and
I
was
staying
with
her
.
You
know
,
Mrs.
*NL*
Farebrother
,
ours
is
a
cheerful
house
.
I
am
of
a
cheerful
disposition
*NL*
myself
,
and
Mr.
Vincy
always
likes
something
to
be
going
on
.
That
is
*NL*
what
Rosamond
has
been
used
to
.
Very
different
from
a
husband
out
at
*NL*
odd
hours
,
and
never
knowing
when
he
will
come
home
,
and
of
a
close
,
*NL*
proud
disposition
,
_
I
_
think
''
--
indiscreet
Mrs.
Vincy
did
lower
her
tone
*NL*
slightly
with
this
parenthesis
.
``
But
Rosamond
always
had
an
angel
of
a
*NL*
temper
;
her
brothers
used
very
often
not
to
please
her
,
but
she
was
*NL*
never
the
girl
to
show
temper
;
from
a
baby
she
was
always
as
good
as
*NL*
good
,
and
with
a
complexion
beyond
anything
.
But
my
children
are
all
*NL*
good-tempered
,
thank
God
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
easily
credible
to
any
one
looking
at
Mrs.
Vincy
as
she
threw
*NL*
back
her
broad
cap-strings
,
and
smiled
towards
her
three
little
girls
,
*NL*
aged
from
seven
to
eleven
.
But
in
that
smiling
glance
she
was
obliged
*NL*
to
include
Mary
Garth
,
whom
the
three
girls
had
got
into
a
corner
to
*NL*
make
her
tell
them
stories
.
Mary
was
just
finishing
the
delicious
tale
*NL*
of
Rumpelstiltskin
,
which
she
had
well
by
heart
,
because
Letty
was
*NL*
never
tired
of
communicating
it
to
her
ignorant
elders
from
a
favorite
*NL*
red
volume
.
Louisa
,
Mrs.
Vincy
's
darling
,
now
ran
to
her
with
*NL*
wide-eyed
serious
excitement
,
crying
,
``
Oh
mamma
,
mamma
,
the
little
man
*NL*
stamped
so
hard
on
the
floor
he
could
n't
get
his
leg
out
again
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bless
you
,
my
cherub
!
''
said
mamma
;
``
you
shall
tell
me
all
about
it
*NL*
to-morrow
.
Go
and
listen
!
''
and
then
,
as
her
eyes
followed
Louisa
back
*NL*
towards
the
attractive
corner
,
she
thought
that
if
Fred
wished
her
to
*NL*
invite
Mary
again
she
would
make
no
objection
,
the
children
being
so
*NL*
pleased
with
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
presently
the
corner
became
still
more
animated
,
for
Mr.
*NL*
Farebrother
came
in
,
and
seating
himself
behind
Louisa
,
took
her
on
his
*NL*
lap
;
whereupon
the
girls
all
insisted
that
he
must
hear
*NL*
Rumpelstiltskin
,
and
Mary
must
tell
it
over
again
.
He
insisted
too
,
*NL*
and
Mary
,
without
fuss
,
began
again
in
her
neat
fashion
,
with
precisely
*NL*
the
same
words
as
before
.
Fred
,
who
had
also
seated
himself
near
,
*NL*
would
have
felt
unmixed
triumph
in
Mary
's
effectiveness
if
Mr.
*NL*
Farebrother
had
not
been
looking
at
her
with
evident
admiration
,
while
*NL*
he
dramatized
an
intense
interest
in
the
tale
to
please
the
children
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
never
care
any
more
about
my
one-eyed
giant
,
Loo
,
''
said
Fred
*NL*
at
the
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
shall
.
Tell
about
him
now
,
''
said
Louisa
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
dare
say
;
I
am
quite
cut
out
.
Ask
Mr.
Farebrother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
added
Mary
;
``
ask
Mr.
Farebrother
to
tell
you
about
the
ants
*NL*
whose
beautiful
house
was
knocked
down
by
a
giant
named
Tom
,
and
he
*NL*
thought
they
did
n't
mind
because
he
could
n't
hear
them
cry
,
or
see
them
*NL*
use
their
pocket-handkerchiefs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Please
,
''
said
Louisa
,
looking
up
at
the
Vicar
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
I
am
a
grave
old
parson
.
If
I
try
to
draw
a
story
out
of
my
*NL*
bag
a
sermon
comes
instead
.
Shall
I
preach
you
a
sermon
?
''
said
he
,
*NL*
putting
on
his
short-sighted
glasses
,
and
pursing
up
his
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Louisa
,
falteringly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
see
,
then
.
Against
cakes
:
how
cakes
are
bad
things
,
especially
*NL*
if
they
are
sweet
and
have
plums
in
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Louisa
took
the
affair
rather
seriously
,
and
got
down
from
the
Vicar
's
*NL*
knee
to
go
to
Fred
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
I
see
it
will
not
do
to
preach
on
New
Year
's
Day
,
''
said
Mr.
*NL*
Farebrother
,
rising
and
walking
away
.
He
had
discovered
of
late
that
*NL*
Fred
had
become
jealous
of
him
,
and
also
that
he
himself
was
not
losing
*NL*
his
preference
for
Mary
above
all
other
women
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
delightful
young
person
is
Miss
Garth
,
''
said
Mrs.
Farebrother
,
who
*NL*
had
been
watching
her
son
's
movements
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Mrs.
Vincy
,
obliged
to
reply
,
as
the
old
lady
turned
to
her
*NL*
expectantly
.
``
It
is
a
pity
she
is
not
better-looking
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
say
that
,
''
said
Mrs.
Farebrother
,
decisively
.
``
I
like
her
*NL*
countenance
.
We
must
not
always
ask
for
beauty
,
when
a
good
God
has
*NL*
seen
fit
to
make
an
excellent
young
woman
without
it
.
I
put
good
*NL*
manners
first
,
and
Miss
Garth
will
know
how
to
conduct
herself
in
any
*NL*
station
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
lady
was
a
little
sharp
in
her
tone
,
having
a
prospective
*NL*
reference
to
Mary
's
becoming
her
daughter-in-law
;
for
there
was
this
*NL*
inconvenience
in
Mary
's
position
with
regard
to
Fred
,
that
it
was
not
*NL*
suitable
to
be
made
public
,
and
hence
the
three
ladies
at
Lowick
*NL*
Parsonage
were
still
hoping
that
Camden
would
choose
Miss
Garth
.
*NL*
*NL*
New
visitors
entered
,
and
the
drawing-room
was
given
up
to
music
and
*NL*
games
,
while
whist-tables
were
prepared
in
the
quiet
room
on
the
other
*NL*
side
of
the
hall
.
Mr.
Farebrother
played
a
rubber
to
satisfy
his
*NL*
mother
,
who
regarded
her
occasional
whist
as
a
protest
against
scandal
*NL*
and
novelty
of
opinion
,
in
which
light
even
a
revoke
had
its
dignity
.
*NL*
But
at
the
end
he
got
Mr.
Chichely
to
take
his
place
,
and
left
the
*NL*
room
.
As
he
crossed
the
hall
,
Lydgate
had
just
come
in
and
was
taking
*NL*
off
his
great-coat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
the
man
I
was
going
to
look
for
,
''
said
the
Vicar
;
and
instead
*NL*
of
entering
the
drawing-room
,
they
walked
along
the
hall
and
stood
*NL*
against
the
fireplace
,
where
the
frosty
air
helped
to
make
a
glowing
*NL*
bank
.
``
You
see
,
I
can
leave
the
whist-table
easily
enough
,
''
he
went
*NL*
on
,
smiling
at
Lydgate
,
``
now
I
do
n't
play
for
money
.
I
owe
that
to
*NL*
you
,
Mrs.
Casaubon
says
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
?
''
said
Lydgate
,
coldly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
you
did
n't
mean
me
to
know
it
;
I
call
that
ungenerous
reticence
.
*NL*
You
should
let
a
man
have
the
pleasure
of
feeling
that
you
have
done
*NL*
him
a
good
turn
.
I
do
n't
enter
into
some
people
's
dislike
of
being
*NL*
under
an
obligation
:
upon
my
word
,
I
prefer
being
under
an
obligation
*NL*
to
everybody
for
behaving
well
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
tell
what
you
mean
,
''
said
Lydgate
,
``
unless
it
is
that
I
once
*NL*
spoke
of
you
to
Mrs.
Casaubon
.
But
I
did
not
think
that
she
would
*NL*
break
her
promise
not
to
mention
that
I
had
done
so
,
''
said
Lydgate
,
*NL*
leaning
his
back
against
the
corner
of
the
mantel-piece
,
and
showing
no
*NL*
radiance
in
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
Brooke
who
let
it
out
,
only
the
other
day
.
He
paid
me
the
*NL*
compliment
of
saying
that
he
was
very
glad
I
had
the
living
though
you
*NL*
had
come
across
his
tactics
,
and
had
praised
me
up
as
a
lien
and
a
*NL*
Tillotson
,
and
that
sort
of
thing
,
till
Mrs.
Casaubon
would
hear
of
no
*NL*
one
else
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Brooke
is
such
a
leaky-minded
fool
,
''
said
Lydgate
,
contemptuously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
was
glad
of
the
leakiness
then
.
I
do
n't
see
why
you
should
n't
*NL*
like
me
to
know
that
you
wished
to
do
me
a
service
,
my
dear
fellow
.
*NL*
And
you
certainly
have
done
me
one
.
It
's
rather
a
strong
check
to
*NL*
one
's
self-complacency
to
find
how
much
of
one
's
right
doing
depends
on
*NL*
not
being
in
want
of
money
.
A
man
will
not
be
tempted
to
say
the
*NL*
Lord
's
Prayer
backward
to
please
the
devil
,
if
he
does
n't
want
the
*NL*
devil
's
services
.
I
have
no
need
to
hang
on
the
smiles
of
chance
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
see
that
there
's
any
money-getting
without
chance
,
''
said
*NL*
Lydgate
;
``
if
a
man
gets
it
in
a
profession
,
it
's
pretty
sure
to
come
by
*NL*
chance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Farebrother
thought
he
could
account
for
this
speech
,
in
striking
*NL*
contrast
with
Lydgate
's
former
way
of
talking
,
as
the
perversity
which
*NL*
will
often
spring
from
the
moodiness
of
a
man
ill
at
ease
in
his
*NL*
affairs
.
He
answered
in
a
tone
of
good-humored
admission
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
there
's
enormous
patience
wanted
with
the
way
of
the
world
.
But
*NL*
it
is
the
easier
for
a
man
to
wait
patiently
when
he
has
friends
who
*NL*
love
him
,
and
ask
for
nothing
better
than
to
help
him
through
,
so
far
*NL*
as
it
lies
in
their
power
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
,
''
said
Lydgate
,
in
a
careless
tone
,
changing
his
attitude
and
*NL*
looking
at
his
watch
.
``
People
make
much
more
of
their
difficulties
*NL*
than
they
need
to
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
knew
as
distinctly
as
possible
that
this
was
an
offer
of
help
to
*NL*
himself
from
Mr.
Farebrother
,
and
he
could
not
bear
it
.
So
strangely
*NL*
determined
are
we
mortals
,
that
,
after
having
been
long
gratified
with
*NL*
the
sense
that
he
had
privately
done
the
Vicar
a
service
,
the
*NL*
suggestion
that
the
Vicar
discerned
his
need
of
a
service
in
return
*NL*
made
him
shrink
into
unconquerable
reticence
.
Besides
,
behind
all
*NL*
making
of
such
offers
what
else
must
come
?
--
that
he
should
``
mention
his
*NL*
case
,
''
imply
that
he
wanted
specific
things
.
At
that
moment
,
suicide
*NL*
seemed
easier
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Farebrother
was
too
keen
a
man
not
to
know
the
meaning
of
that
*NL*
reply
,
and
there
was
a
certain
massiveness
in
Lydgate
's
manner
and
*NL*
tone
,
corresponding
with
his
physique
,
which
if
he
repelled
your
*NL*
advances
in
the
first
instance
seemed
to
put
persuasive
devices
out
of
*NL*
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
time
are
you
?
''
said
the
Vicar
,
devouring
his
wounded
feeling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
After
eleven
,
''
said
Lydgate
.
And
they
went
into
the
drawing-room

CHAPTER
LXIV

1st

Where
lies
the
power

there
let
the
blame
lie
too

*NL*
2d
Gent
.
Nay
,
power
is
relative
;
you
can
not
fright
*NL*
The
coming
pest
with
border
fortresses
,
*NL*
Or
catch
your
carp
with
subtle
argument
.
*NL*
All
force
is
twain
in
one
:
cause
is
not
cause
*NL*
Unless
effect
be
there
;
and
action
's
self
*NL*
Must
needs
contain
a
passive
.
So
command
*NL*
Exists
but
with
obedience
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Even
if
Lydgate
had
been
inclined
to
be
quite
open
about
his
affairs
,
*NL*
he
knew
that
it
would
have
hardly
been
in
Mr.
Farebrother
's
power
to
*NL*
give
him
the
help
he
immediately
wanted
.
With
the
year
's
bills
coming
*NL*
in
from
his
tradesmen
,
with
Dover
's
threatening
hold
on
his
furniture
,
*NL*
and
with
nothing
to
depend
on
but
slow
dribbling
payments
from
patients
*NL*
who
must
not
be
offended
--
for
the
handsome
fees
he
had
had
from
*NL*
Freshitt
Hall
and
Lowick
Manor
had
been
easily
absorbed
--
nothing
less
*NL*
than
a
thousand
pounds
would
have
freed
him
from
actual
embarrassment
,
*NL*
and
left
a
residue
which
,
according
to
the
favorite
phrase
of
*NL*
hopefulness
in
such
circumstances
,
would
have
given
him
``
time
to
look
*NL*
about
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Naturally
,
the
merry
Christmas
bringing
the
happy
New
Year
,
when
*NL*
fellow-citizens
expect
to
be
paid
for
the
trouble
and
goods
they
have
*NL*
smilingly
bestowed
on
their
neighbors
,
had
so
tightened
the
pressure
of
*NL*
sordid
cares
on
Lydgate
's
mind
that
it
was
hardly
possible
for
him
to
*NL*
think
unbrokenly
of
any
other
subject
,
even
the
most
habitual
and
*NL*
soliciting
.
He
was
not
an
ill-tempered
man
;
his
intellectual
activity
,
*NL*
the
ardent
kindness
of
his
heart
,
as
well
as
his
strong
frame
,
would
*NL*
always
,
under
tolerably
easy
conditions
,
have
kept
him
above
the
petty
*NL*
uncontrolled
susceptibilities
which
make
bad
temper
.
But
he
was
now
a
*NL*
prey
to
that
worst
irritation
which
arises
not
simply
from
annoyances
,
*NL*
but
from
the
second
consciousness
underlying
those
annoyances
,
of
*NL*
wasted
energy
and
a
degrading
preoccupation
,
which
was
the
reverse
of
*NL*
all
his
former
purposes
.
''
_
This
_
is
what
I
am
thinking
of
;
and
_
that
_
*NL*
is
what
I
might
have
been
thinking
of
,
''
was
the
bitter
incessant
murmur
*NL*
within
him
,
making
every
difficulty
a
double
goad
to
impatience
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
gentlemen
have
made
an
amazing
figure
in
literature
by
general
*NL*
discontent
with
the
universe
as
a
trap
of
dulness
into
which
their
*NL*
great
souls
have
fallen
by
mistake
;
but
the
sense
of
a
stupendous
self
*NL*
and
an
insignificant
world
may
have
its
consolations
.
Lydgate
's
*NL*
discontent
was
much
harder
to
bear
:
it
was
the
sense
that
there
was
a
*NL*
grand
existence
in
thought
and
effective
action
lying
around
him
,
while
*NL*
his
self
was
being
narrowed
into
the
miserable
isolation
of
egoistic
*NL*
fears
,
and
vulgar
anxieties
for
events
that
might
allay
such
fears
.
*NL*
His
troubles
will
perhaps
appear
miserably
sordid
,
and
beneath
the
*NL*
attention
of
lofty
persons
who
can
know
nothing
of
debt
except
on
a
*NL*
magnificent
scale
.
Doubtless
they
were
sordid
;
and
for
the
majority
,
*NL*
who
are
not
lofty
,
there
is
no
escape
from
sordidness
but
by
being
free
*NL*
from
money-craving
,
with
all
its
base
hopes
and
temptations
,
its
*NL*
watching
for
death
,
its
hinted
requests
,
its
horse-dealer
's
desire
to
*NL*
make
bad
work
pass
for
good
,
its
seeking
for
function
which
ought
to
be
*NL*
another
's
,
its
compulsion
often
to
long
for
Luck
in
the
shape
of
a
wide
*NL*
calamity
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
because
Lydgate
writhed
under
the
idea
of
getting
his
neck
*NL*
beneath
this
vile
yoke
that
he
had
fallen
into
a
bitter
moody
state
*NL*
which
was
continually
widening
Rosamond
's
alienation
from
him
.
After
*NL*
the
first
disclosure
about
the
bill
of
sale
,
he
had
made
many
efforts
*NL*
to
draw
her
into
sympathy
with
him
about
possible
measures
for
*NL*
narrowing
their
expenses
,
and
with
the
threatening
approach
of
*NL*
Christmas
his
propositions
grew
more
and
more
definite
.
``
We
two
can
do
*NL*
with
only
one
servant
,
and
live
on
very
little
,
''
he
said
,
``
and
I
shall
*NL*
manage
with
one
horse
.
''
For
Lydgate
,
as
we
have
seen
,
had
begun
to
*NL*
reason
,
with
a
more
distinct
vision
,
about
the
expenses
of
living
,
and
*NL*
any
share
of
pride
he
had
given
to
appearances
of
that
sort
was
meagre
*NL*
compared
with
the
pride
which
made
him
revolt
from
exposure
as
a
*NL*
debtor
,
or
from
asking
men
to
help
him
with
their
money
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
you
can
dismiss
the
other
two
servants
,
if
you
like
,
''
said
*NL*
Rosamond
;
``
but
I
should
have
thought
it
would
be
very
injurious
to
your
*NL*
position
for
us
to
live
in
a
poor
way
.
You
must
expect
your
practice
*NL*
to
be
lowered
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Rosamond
,
it
is
not
a
question
of
choice
.
We
have
begun
too
*NL*
expensively
.
Peacock
,
you
know
,
lived
in
a
much
smaller
house
than
*NL*
this
.
It
is
my
fault
:
I
ought
to
have
known
better
,
and
I
deserve
a
*NL*
thrashing
--
if
there
were
anybody
who
had
a
right
to
give
it
me
--
for
*NL*
bringing
you
into
the
necessity
of
living
in
a
poorer
way
than
you
have
*NL*
been
used
to
.
But
we
married
because
we
loved
each
other
,
I
suppose
.
*NL*
And
that
may
help
us
to
pull
along
till
things
get
better
.
Come
,
dear
,
*NL*
put
down
that
work
and
come
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
really
in
chill
gloom
about
her
at
that
moment
,
but
he
dreaded
a
*NL*
future
without
affection
,
and
was
determined
to
resist
the
oncoming
of
*NL*
division
between
them
.
Rosamond
obeyed
him
,
and
he
took
her
on
his
*NL*
knee
,
but
in
her
secret
soul
she
was
utterly
aloof
from
him
.
The
poor
*NL*
thing
saw
only
that
the
world
was
not
ordered
to
her
liking
,
and
*NL*
Lydgate
was
part
of
that
world
.
But
he
held
her
waist
with
one
hand
*NL*
and
laid
the
other
gently
on
both
of
hers
;
for
this
rather
abrupt
man
*NL*
had
much
tenderness
in
his
manners
towards
women
,
seeming
to
have
*NL*
always
present
in
his
imagination
the
weakness
of
their
frames
and
the
*NL*
delicate
poise
of
their
health
both
in
body
and
mind
.
And
he
began
*NL*
again
to
speak
persuasively
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
find
,
now
I
look
into
things
a
little
,
Rosy
,
that
it
is
wonderful
*NL*
what
an
amount
of
money
slips
away
in
our
housekeeping
.
I
suppose
the
*NL*
servants
are
careless
,
and
we
have
had
a
great
many
people
coming
.
But
*NL*
there
must
be
many
in
our
rank
who
manage
with
much
less
:
they
must
do
*NL*
with
commoner
things
,
I
suppose
,
and
look
after
the
scraps
.
It
seems
,
*NL*
money
goes
but
a
little
way
in
these
matters
,
for
Wrench
has
everything
*NL*
as
plain
as
possible
,
and
he
has
a
very
large
practice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
if
you
think
of
living
as
the
Wrenches
do
!
''
said
Rosamond
,
with
a
*NL*
little
turn
of
her
neck
.
``
But
I
have
heard
you
express
your
disgust
at
*NL*
that
way
of
living
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
they
have
bad
taste
in
everything
--
they
make
economy
look
ugly
.
*NL*
We
need
n't
do
that
.
I
only
meant
that
they
avoid
expenses
,
although
*NL*
Wrench
has
a
capital
practice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
should
not
you
have
a
good
practice
,
Tertius
?
Mr.
Peacock
had
.
*NL*
You
should
be
more
careful
not
to
offend
people
,
and
you
should
send
*NL*
out
medicines
as
the
others
do
.
I
am
sure
you
began
well
,
and
you
got
*NL*
several
good
houses
.
It
can
not
answer
to
be
eccentric
;
you
should
*NL*
think
what
will
be
generally
liked
,
''
said
Rosamond
,
in
a
decided
little
*NL*
tone
of
admonition
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lydgate
's
anger
rose
:
he
was
prepared
to
be
indulgent
towards
feminine
*NL*
weakness
,
but
not
towards
feminine
dictation
.
The
shallowness
of
a
*NL*
waternixie
's
soul
may
have
a
charm
until
she
becomes
didactic
.
But
he
*NL*
controlled
himself
,
and
only
said
,
with
a
touch
of
despotic
firmness
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
I
am
to
do
in
my
practice
,
Rosy
,
it
is
for
me
to
judge
.
That
is
*NL*
not
the
question
between
us
.
It
is
enough
for
you
to
know
that
our
*NL*
income
is
likely
to
be
a
very
narrow
one
--
hardly
four
hundred
,
perhaps
*NL*
less
,
for
a
long
time
to
come
,
and
we
must
try
to
re-arrange
our
lives
*NL*
in
accordance
with
that
fact
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Rosamond
was
silent
for
a
moment
or
two
,
looking
before
her
,
and
then
*NL*
said
,
``
My
uncle
Bulstrode
ought
to
allow
you
a
salary
for
the
time
you
*NL*
give
to
the
Hospital
:
it
is
not
right
that
you
should
work
for
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
understood
from
the
beginning
that
my
services
would
be
*NL*
gratuitous
.
That
,
again
,
need
not
enter
into
our
discussion
.
I
have
*NL*
pointed
out
what
is
the
only
probability
,
''
said
Lydgate
,
impatiently
.
*NL*
Then
checking
himself
,
he
went
on
more
quietly
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
see
one
resource
which
would
free
us
from
a
good
deal
of
the
*NL*
present
difficulty
.
I
hear
that
young
Ned
Plymdale
is
going
to
be
*NL*
married
to
Miss
Sophy
Toller
.
They
are
rich
,
and
it
is
not
often
that
*NL*
a
good
house
is
vacant
in
Middlemarch
.
I
feel
sure
that
they
would
be
*NL*
glad
to
take
this
house
from
us
with
most
of
our
furniture
,
and
they
*NL*
would
be
willing
to
pay
handsomely
for
the
lease
.
I
can
employ
*NL*
Trumbull
to
speak
to
Plymdale
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Rosamond
left
her
husband
's
knee
and
walked
slowly
to
the
other
end
of
*NL*
the
room
;
when
she
turned
round
and
walked
towards
him
it
was
evident
*NL*
that
the
tears
had
come
,
and
that
she
was
biting
her
under-lip
and
*NL*
clasping
her
hands
to
keep
herself
from
crying
.
Lydgate
was
*NL*
wretched
--
shaken
with
anger
and
yet
feeling
that
it
would
be
unmanly
to
*NL*
vent
the
anger
just
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
sorry
,
Rosamond
;
I
know
this
is
painful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
,
at
least
,
when
I
had
borne
to
send
the
plate
back
and
have
*NL*
that
man
taking
an
inventory
of
the
furniture
--
I
should
have
thought
*NL*
_
that
_
would
suffice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
explained
it
to
you
at
the
time
,
dear
.
That
was
only
a
security
and
*NL*
behind
that
security
there
is
a
debt
.
And
that
debt
must
be
paid
*NL*
within
the
next
few
months
,
else
we
shall
have
our
furniture
sold
.
If
*NL*
young
Plymdale
will
take
our
house
and
most
of
our
furniture
,
we
shall
*NL*
be
able
to
pay
that
debt
,
and
some
others
too
,
and
we
shall
be
quit
of
*NL*
a
place
too
expensive
for
us
.
We
might
take
a
smaller
house
:
Trumbull
,
*NL*
I
know
,
has
a
very
decent
one
to
let
at
thirty
pounds
a-year
,
and
this
*NL*
is
ninety
.
''
Lydgate
uttered
this
speech
in
the
curt
hammering
way
with
*NL*
which
we
usually
try
to
nail
down
a
vague
mind
to
imperative
facts
.
*NL*
Tears
rolled
silently
down
Rosamond
's
cheeks
;
she
just
pressed
her
*NL*
handkerchief
against
them
,
and
stood
looking
at
the
large
vase
on
the
*NL*
mantel-piece
.
It
was
a
moment
of
more
intense
bitterness
than
she
had
*NL*
ever
felt
before
.
At
last
she
said
,
without
hurry
and
with
careful
*NL*
emphasis
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
could
have
believed
that
you
would
like
to
act
in
that
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Like
it
?
''
burst
out
Lydgate
,
rising
from
his
chair
,
thrusting
his
*NL*
hands
in
his
pockets
and
stalking
away
from
the
hearth
;
``
it
's
not
a
*NL*
question
of
liking
.
Of
course
,
I
do
n't
like
it
;
it
's
the
only
thing
I
*NL*
can
do
.
''
He
wheeled
round
there
,
and
turned
towards
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
have
thought
there
were
many
other
means
than
that
,
''
said
*NL*
Rosamond
.
``
Let
us
have
a
sale
and
leave
Middlemarch
altogether
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
do
what
?
What
is
the
use
of
my
leaving
my
work
in
Middlemarch
to
*NL*
go
where
I
have
none
?
We
should
be
just
as
penniless
elsewhere
as
we
*NL*
are
here
,
''
said
Lydgate
still
more
angrily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
we
are
to
be
in
that
position
it
will
be
entirely
your
own
doing
,
*NL*
Tertius
,
''
said
Rosamond
,
turning
round
to
speak
with
the
fullest
*NL*
conviction
.
``
You
will
not
behave
as
you
ought
to
do
to
your
own
*NL*
family
.
You
offended
Captain
Lydgate
.
Sir
Godwin
was
very
kind
to
me
*NL*
when
we
were
at
Quallingham
,
and
I
am
sure
if
you
showed
proper
regard
*NL*
to
him
and
told
him
your
affairs
,
he
would
do
anything
for
you
.
But
*NL*
rather
than
that
,
you
like
giving
up
our
house
and
furniture
to
Mr.
Ned
*NL*
Plymdale
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
something
like
fierceness
in
Lydgate
's
eyes
,
as
he
answered
*NL*
with
new
violence
,
``
Well
,
then
,
if
you
will
have
it
so
,
I
do
like
it
.
*NL*
I
admit
that
I
like
it
better
than
making
a
fool
of
myself
by
going
to
*NL*
beg
where
it
's
of
no
use
.
Understand
then
,
that
it
is
what
I
_
like
to
*NL*
do
.
_
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
tone
in
the
last
sentence
which
was
equivalent
to
the
*NL*
clutch
of
his
strong
hand
on
Rosamond
's
delicate
arm
.
But
for
all
*NL*
that
,
his
will
was
not
a
whit
stronger
than
hers
.
She
immediately
*NL*
walked
out
of
the
room
in
silence
,
but
with
an
intense
determination
to
*NL*
hinder
what
Lydgate
liked
to
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
out
of
the
house
,
but
as
his
blood
cooled
he
felt
that
the
*NL*
chief
result
of
the
discussion
was
a
deposit
of
dread
within
him
at
the
*NL*
idea
of
opening
with
his
wife
in
future
subjects
which
might
again
urge
*NL*
him
to
violent
speech
.
It
was
as
if
a
fracture
in
delicate
crystal
had
*NL*
begun
,
and
he
was
afraid
of
any
movement
that
might
make
it
fatal
.
His
*NL*
marriage
would
be
a
mere
piece
of
bitter
irony
if
they
could
not
go
on
*NL*
loving
each
other
.
He
had
long
ago
made
up
his
mind
to
what
he
thought
*NL*
was
her
negative
character
--
her
want
of
sensibility
,
which
showed
*NL*
itself
in
disregard
both
of
his
specific
wishes
and
of
his
general
*NL*
aims
.
The
first
great
disappointment
had
been
borne
:
the
tender
*NL*
devotedness
and
docile
adoration
of
the
ideal
wife
must
be
renounced
,
*NL*
and
life
must
be
taken
up
on
a
lower
stage
of
expectation
,
as
it
is
by
*NL*
men
who
have
lost
their
limbs
.
But
the
real
wife
had
not
only
her
*NL*
claims
,
she
had
still
a
hold
on
his
heart
,
and
it
was
his
intense
*NL*
desire
that
the
hold
should
remain
strong
.
In
marriage
,
the
certainty
,
*NL*
``
She
will
never
love
me
much
,
''
is
easier
to
bear
than
the
fear
,
``
I
*NL*
shall
love
her
no
more
.
''
Hence
,
after
that
outburst
,
his
inward
effort
*NL*
was
entirely
to
excuse
her
,
and
to
blame
the
hard
circumstances
which
*NL*
were
partly
his
fault
.
He
tried
that
evening
,
by
petting
her
,
to
heal
*NL*
the
wound
he
had
made
in
the
morning
,
and
it
was
not
in
Rosamond
's
*NL*
nature
to
be
repellent
or
sulky
;
indeed
,
she
welcomed
the
signs
that
*NL*
her
husband
loved
her
and
was
under
control
.
But
this
was
something
*NL*
quite
distinct
from
loving
_
him
_
.
Lydgate
would
not
have
chosen
soon
to
*NL*
recur
to
the
plan
of
parting
with
the
house
;
he
was
resolved
to
carry
*NL*
it
out
,
and
say
as
little
more
about
it
as
possible
.
But
Rosamond
*NL*
herself
touched
on
it
at
breakfast
by
saying
,
mildly
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
spoken
to
Trumbull
yet
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Lydgate
,
``
but
I
shall
call
on
him
as
I
go
by
this
morning
.
*NL*
No
time
must
be
lost
.
''
He
took
Rosamond
's
question
as
a
sign
that
she
*NL*
withdrew
her
inward
opposition
,
and
kissed
her
head
caressingly
when
he
*NL*
got
up
to
go
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
it
was
late
enough
to
make
a
call
,
Rosamond
went
to
Mrs.
*NL*
Plymdale
,
Mr.
Ned
's
mother
,
and
entered
with
pretty
congratulations
*NL*
into
the
subject
of
the
coming
marriage
.
Mrs.
Plymdale
's
maternal
view
*NL*
was
,
that
Rosamond
might
possibly
now
have
retrospective
glimpses
of
*NL*
her
own
folly
;
and
feeling
the
advantages
to
be
at
present
all
on
the
*NL*
side
of
her
son
,
was
too
kind
a
woman
not
to
behave
graciously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Ned
is
most
happy
,
I
must
say
.
And
Sophy
Toller
is
all
I
could
*NL*
desire
in
a
daughter-in-law
.
Of
course
her
father
is
able
to
do
*NL*
something
handsome
for
her
--
that
is
only
what
would
be
expected
with
a
*NL*
brewery
like
his
.
And
the
connection
is
everything
we
should
desire
.
*NL*
But
that
is
not
what
I
look
at
.
She
is
such
a
very
nice
girl
--
no
airs
,
*NL*
no
pretensions
,
though
on
a
level
with
the
first
.
I
do
n't
mean
with
*NL*
the
titled
aristocracy
.
I
see
very
little
good
in
people
aiming
out
of
*NL*
their
own
sphere
.
I
mean
that
Sophy
is
equal
to
the
best
in
the
town
,
*NL*
and
she
is
contented
with
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
always
thought
her
very
agreeable
,
''
said
Rosamond
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
look
upon
it
as
a
reward
for
Ned
,
who
never
held
his
head
too
high
,
*NL*
that
he
should
have
got
into
the
very
best
connection
,
''
continued
Mrs.
*NL*
Plymdale
,
her
native
sharpness
softened
by
a
fervid
sense
that
she
was
*NL*
taking
a
correct
view
.
``
And
such
particular
people
as
the
Tollers
are
,
*NL*
they
might
have
objected
because
some
of
our
friends
are
not
theirs
.
*NL*
It
is
well
known
that
your
aunt
Bulstrode
and
I
have
been
intimate
from
*NL*
our
youth
,
and
Mr.
Plymdale
has
been
always
on
Mr.
Bulstrode
's
side
.
*NL*
And
I
myself
prefer
serious
opinions
.
But
the
Tollers
have
welcomed
*NL*
Ned
all
the
same
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sure
he
is
a
very
deserving
,
well-principled
young
man
,
''
said
*NL*
Rosamond
,
with
a
neat
air
of
patronage
in
return
for
Mrs.
Plymdale
's
*NL*
wholesome
corrections
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
he
has
not
the
style
of
a
captain
in
the
army
,
or
that
sort
of
*NL*
carriage
as
if
everybody
was
beneath
him
,
or
that
showy
kind
of
*NL*
talking
,
and
singing
,
and
intellectual
talent
.
But
I
am
thankful
he
*NL*
has
not
.
It
is
a
poor
preparation
both
for
here
and
Hereafter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
dear
,
yes
;
appearances
have
very
little
to
do
with
happiness
,
''
said
*NL*
Rosamond
.
``
I
think
there
is
every
prospect
of
their
being
a
happy
*NL*
couple
.
What
house
will
they
take
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
as
for
that
,
they
must
put
up
with
what
they
can
get
.
They
have
*NL*
been
looking
at
the
house
in
St.
Peter
's
Place
,
next
to
Mr.
Hackbutt
's
;
*NL*
it
belongs
to
him
,
and
he
is
putting
it
nicely
in
repair
.
I
suppose
*NL*
they
are
not
likely
to
hear
of
a
better
.
Indeed
,
I
think
Ned
will
*NL*
decide
the
matter
to-day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
think
it
is
a
nice
house
;
I
like
St.
Peter
's
Place
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
it
is
near
the
Church
,
and
a
genteel
situation
.
But
the
windows
*NL*
are
narrow
,
and
it
is
all
ups
and
downs
.
You
do
n't
happen
to
know
of
*NL*
any
other
that
would
be
at
liberty
?
''
said
Mrs.
Plymdale
,
fixing
her
*NL*
round
black
eyes
on
Rosamond
with
the
animation
of
a
sudden
thought
in
*NL*
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
;
I
hear
so
little
of
those
things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Rosamond
had
not
foreseen
that
question
and
answer
in
setting
out
to
*NL*
pay
her
visit
;
she
had
simply
meant
to
gather
any
information
which
*NL*
would
help
her
to
avert
the
parting
with
her
own
house
under
*NL*
circumstances
thoroughly
disagreeable
to
her
.
As
to
the
untruth
in
her
*NL*
reply
,
she
no
more
reflected
on
it
than
she
did
on
the
untruth
there
*NL*
was
in
her
saying
that
appearances
had
very
little
to
do
with
*NL*
happiness
.
Her
object
,
she
was
convinced
,
was
thoroughly
justifiable
:
*NL*
it
was
Lydgate
whose
intention
was
inexcusable
;
and
there
was
a
plan
in
*NL*
her
mind
which
,
when
she
had
carried
it
out
fully
,
would
prove
how
very
*NL*
false
a
step
it
would
have
been
for
him
to
have
descended
from
his
*NL*
position
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
returned
home
by
Mr.
Borthrop
Trumbull
's
office
,
meaning
to
call
*NL*
there
.
It
was
the
first
time
in
her
life
that
Rosamond
had
thought
of
*NL*
doing
anything
in
the
form
of
business
,
but
she
felt
equal
to
the
*NL*
occasion
.
That
she
should
be
obliged
to
do
what
she
intensely
*NL*
disliked
,
was
an
idea
which
turned
her
quiet
tenacity
into
active
*NL*
invention
.
Here
was
a
case
in
which
it
could
not
be
enough
simply
to
*NL*
disobey
and
be
serenely
,
placidly
obstinate
:
she
must
act
according
to
*NL*
her
judgment
,
and
she
said
to
herself
that
her
judgment
was
*NL*
right
--
``
indeed
,
if
it
had
not
been
,
she
would
not
have
wished
to
act
on
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Trumbull
was
in
the
back-room
of
his
office
,
and
received
Rosamond
*NL*
with
his
finest
manners
,
not
only
because
he
had
much
sensibility
to
*NL*
her
charms
,
but
because
the
good-natured
fibre
in
him
was
stirred
by
*NL*
his
certainty
that
Lydgate
was
in
difficulties
,
and
that
this
*NL*
uncommonly
pretty
woman
--
this
young
lady
with
the
highest
personal
*NL*
attractions
--
was
likely
to
feel
the
pinch
of
trouble
--
to
find
herself
*NL*
involved
in
circumstances
beyond
her
control
.
He
begged
her
to
do
him
*NL*
the
honor
to
take
a
seat
,
and
stood
before
her
trimming
and
comporting
*NL*
himself
with
an
eager
solicitude
,
which
was
chiefly
benevolent
.
*NL*
Rosamond
's
first
question
was
,
whether
her
husband
had
called
on
Mr.
*NL*
Trumbull
that
morning
,
to
speak
about
disposing
of
their
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
ma'am
,
yes
,
he
did
;
he
did
so
,
''
said
the
good
auctioneer
,
trying
*NL*
to
throw
something
soothing
into
his
iteration
.
``
I
was
about
to
fulfil
*NL*
his
order
,
if
possible
,
this
afternoon
.
He
wished
me
not
to
*NL*
procrastinate
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
called
to
tell
you
not
to
go
any
further
,
Mr.
Trumbull
;
and
I
beg
of
*NL*
you
not
to
mention
what
has
been
said
on
the
subject
.
Will
you
oblige
*NL*
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
I
will
,
Mrs.
Lydgate
,
certainly
.
Confidence
is
sacred
with
*NL*
me
on
business
or
any
other
topic
.
I
am
then
to
consider
the
*NL*
commission
withdrawn
?
''
said
Mr.
Trumbull
,
adjusting
the
long
ends
of
*NL*
his
blue
cravat
with
both
hands
,
and
looking
at
Rosamond
deferentially
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
if
you
please
.
I
find
that
Mr.
Ned
Plymdale
has
taken
a
house
--
the
*NL*
one
in
St.
Peter
's
Place
next
to
Mr.
Hackbutt
's
.
Mr.
Lydgate
would
be
*NL*
annoyed
that
his
orders
should
be
fulfilled
uselessly
.
And
besides
*NL*
that
,
there
are
other
circumstances
which
render
the
proposal
*NL*
unnecessary
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
good
,
Mrs.
Lydgate
,
very
good
.
I
am
at
your
commands
,
whenever
*NL*
you
require
any
service
of
me
,
''
said
Mr.
Trumbull
,
who
felt
pleasure
in
*NL*
conjecturing
that
some
new
resources
had
been
opened
.
``
Rely
on
me
,
I
*NL*
beg
.
The
affair
shall
go
no
further
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
evening
Lydgate
was
a
little
comforted
by
observing
that
Rosamond
*NL*
was
more
lively
than
she
had
usually
been
of
late
,
and
even
seemed
*NL*
interested
in
doing
what
would
please
him
without
being
asked
.
He
*NL*
thought
,
``
If
she
will
be
happy
and
I
can
rub
through
,
what
does
it
all
*NL*
signify
?
It
is
only
a
narrow
swamp
that
we
have
to
pass
in
a
long
*NL*
journey
.
If
I
can
get
my
mind
clear
again
,
I
shall
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
so
much
cheered
that
he
began
to
search
for
an
account
of
*NL*
experiments
which
he
had
long
ago
meant
to
look
up
,
and
had
neglected
*NL*
out
of
that
creeping
self-despair
which
comes
in
the
train
of
petty
*NL*
anxieties
.
He
felt
again
some
of
the
old
delightful
absorption
in
a
*NL*
far-reaching
inquiry
,
while
Rosamond
played
the
quiet
music
which
was
*NL*
as
helpful
to
his
meditation
as
the
plash
of
an
oar
on
the
evening
*NL*
lake
.
It
was
rather
late
;
he
had
pushed
away
all
the
books
,
and
was
*NL*
looking
at
the
fire
with
his
hands
clasped
behind
his
head
in
*NL*
forgetfulness
of
everything
except
the
construction
of
a
new
*NL*
controlling
experiment
,
when
Rosamond
,
who
had
left
the
piano
and
was
*NL*
leaning
back
in
her
chair
watching
him
,
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Ned
Plymdale
has
taken
a
house
already
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lydgate
,
startled
and
jarred
,
looked
up
in
silence
for
a
moment
,
like
a
*NL*
man
who
has
been
disturbed
in
his
sleep
.
Then
flushing
with
an
*NL*
unpleasant
consciousness
,
he
asked
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
know
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
called
at
Mrs.
Plymdale
's
this
morning
,
and
she
told
me
that
he
had
*NL*
taken
the
house
in
St.
Peter
's
Place
,
next
to
Mr.
Hackbutt
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lydgate
was
silent
.
He
drew
his
hands
from
behind
his
head
and
pressed
*NL*
them
against
the
hair
which
was
hanging
,
as
it
was
apt
to
do
,
in
a
mass
*NL*
on
his
forehead
,
while
he
rested
his
elbows
on
his
knees
.
He
was
*NL*
feeling
bitter
disappointment
,
as
if
he
had
opened
a
door
out
of
a
*NL*
suffocating
place
and
had
found
it
walled
up
;
but
he
also
felt
sure
*NL*
that
Rosamond
was
pleased
with
the
cause
of
his
disappointment
.
He
*NL*
preferred
not
looking
at
her
and
not
speaking
,
until
he
had
got
over
*NL*
the
first
spasm
of
vexation
.
After
all
,
he
said
in
his
bitterness
,
*NL*
what
can
a
woman
care
about
so
much
as
house
and
furniture
?
a
husband
*NL*
without
them
is
an
absurdity
.
When
he
looked
up
and
pushed
his
hair
*NL*
aside
,
his
dark
eyes
had
a
miserable
blank
non-expectance
of
sympathy
*NL*
in
them
,
but
he
only
said
,
coolly
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
some
one
else
may
turn
up
.
I
told
Trumbull
to
be
on
the
*NL*
look-out
if
he
failed
with
Plymdale
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Rosamond
made
no
remark
.
She
trusted
to
the
chance
that
nothing
more
*NL*
would
pass
between
her
husband
and
the
auctioneer
until
some
issue
*NL*
should
have
justified
her
interference
;
at
any
rate
,
she
had
hindered
*NL*
the
event
which
she
immediately
dreaded
.
After
a
pause
,
she
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
much
money
is
it
that
those
disagreeable
people
want
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
disagreeable
people
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Those
who
took
the
list
--
and
the
others
.
I
mean
,
how
much
money
would
*NL*
satisfy
them
so
that
you
need
not
be
troubled
any
more
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lydgate
surveyed
her
for
a
moment
,
as
if
he
were
looking
for
symptoms
,
*NL*
and
then
said
,
``
Oh
,
if
I
could
have
got
six
hundred
from
Plymdale
for
*NL*
furniture
and
as
premium
,
I
might
have
managed
.
I
could
have
paid
off
*NL*
Dover
,
and
given
enough
on
account
to
the
others
to
make
them
wait
*NL*
patiently
,
if
we
contracted
our
expenses
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
mean
how
much
should
you
want
if
we
stayed
in
this
house
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
More
than
I
am
likely
to
get
anywhere
,
''
said
Lydgate
,
with
rather
a
*NL*
grating
sarcasm
in
his
tone
.
It
angered
him
to
perceive
that
*NL*
Rosamond
's
mind
was
wandering
over
impracticable
wishes
instead
of
*NL*
facing
possible
efforts
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
should
you
not
mention
the
sum
?
''
said
Rosamond
,
with
a
mild
*NL*
indication
that
she
did
not
like
his
manners
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Lydgate
in
a
guessing
tone
,
``
it
would
take
at
least
a
*NL*
thousand
to
set
me
at
ease
.
But
,
''
he
added
,
incisively
,
``
I
have
to
*NL*
consider
what
I
shall
do
without
it
,
not
with
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Rosamond
said
no
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
next
day
she
carried
out
her
plan
of
writing
to
Sir
Godwin
*NL*
Lydgate
.
Since
the
Captain
's
visit
,
she
had
received
a
letter
from
*NL*
him
,
and
also
one
from
Mrs.
Mengan
,
his
married
sister
,
condoling
with
*NL*
her
on
the
loss
of
her
baby
,
and
expressing
vaguely
the
hope
that
they
*NL*
should
see
her
again
at
Quallingham
.
Lydgate
had
told
her
that
this
*NL*
politeness
meant
nothing
;
but
she
was
secretly
convinced
that
any
*NL*
backwardness
in
Lydgate
's
family
towards
him
was
due
to
his
cold
and
*NL*
contemptuous
behavior
,
and
she
had
answered
the
letters
in
her
most
*NL*
charming
manner
,
feeling
some
confidence
that
a
specific
invitation
*NL*
would
follow
.
But
there
had
been
total
silence
.
The
Captain
evidently
*NL*
was
not
a
great
penman
,
and
Rosamond
reflected
that
the
sisters
might
*NL*
have
been
abroad
.
However
,
the
season
was
come
for
thinking
of
friends
*NL*
at
home
,
and
at
any
rate
Sir
Godwin
,
who
had
chucked
her
under
the
*NL*
chin
,
and
pronounced
her
to
be
like
the
celebrated
beauty
,
Mrs.
Croly
,
*NL*
who
had
made
a
conquest
of
him
in
1790
,
would
be
touched
by
any
appeal
*NL*
from
her
,
and
would
find
it
pleasant
for
her
sake
to
behave
as
he
ought
*NL*
to
do
towards
his
nephew
.
Rosamond
was
naively
convinced
of
what
an
*NL*
old
gentleman
ought
to
do
to
prevent
her
from
suffering
annoyance
.
And
*NL*
she
wrote
what
she
considered
the
most
judicious
letter
possible
--
one
*NL*
which
would
strike
Sir
Godwin
as
a
proof
of
her
excellent
sense
--
pointing
*NL*
out
how
desirable
it
was
that
Tertius
should
quit
such
a
place
*NL*
as
Middlemarch
for
one
more
fitted
to
his
talents
,
how
the
unpleasant
*NL*
character
of
the
inhabitants
had
hindered
his
professional
success
,
and
*NL*
how
in
consequence
he
was
in
money
difficulties
,
from
which
it
would
*NL*
require
a
thousand
pounds
thoroughly
to
extricate
him
.
She
did
not
say
*NL*
that
Tertius
was
unaware
of
her
intention
to
write
;
for
she
had
the
*NL*
idea
that
his
supposed
sanction
of
her
letter
would
be
in
accordance
*NL*
with
what
she
did
say
of
his
great
regard
for
his
uncle
Godwin
as
the
*NL*
relative
who
had
always
been
his
best
friend
.
Such
was
the
force
of
*NL*
Poor
Rosamond
's
tactics
now
she
applied
them
to
affairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
had
happened
before
the
party
on
New
Year
's
Day
,
and
no
answer
had
*NL*
yet
come
from
Sir
Godwin
.
But
on
the
morning
of
that
day
Lydgate
had
*NL*
to
learn
that
Rosamond
had
revoked
his
order
to
Borthrop
Trumbull
.
*NL*
Feeling
it
necessary
that
she
should
be
gradually
accustomed
to
the
*NL*
idea
of
their
quitting
the
house
in
Lowick
Gate
,
he
overcame
his
*NL*
reluctance
to
speak
to
her
again
on
the
subject
,
and
when
they
were
*NL*
breakfasting
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
try
to
see
Trumbull
this
morning
,
and
tell
him
to
advertise
*NL*
the
house
in
the
`
Pioneer
'
and
the
`
Trumpet
.
'
If
the
thing
were
*NL*
advertised
,
some
one
might
be
inclined
to
take
it
who
would
not
*NL*
otherwise
have
thought
of
a
change
.
In
these
country
places
many
*NL*
people
go
on
in
their
old
houses
when
their
families
are
too
large
for
*NL*
them
,
for
want
of
knowing
where
they
can
find
another
.
And
Trumbull
*NL*
seems
to
have
got
no
bite
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Rosamond
knew
that
the
inevitable
moment
was
come
.
``
I
ordered
Trumbull
*NL*
not
to
inquire
further
,
''
she
said
,
with
a
careful
calmness
which
was
*NL*
evidently
defensive
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lydgate
stared
at
her
in
mute
amazement
.
Only
half
an
hour
before
he
*NL*
had
been
fastening
up
her
plaits
for
her
,
and
talking
the
``
little
*NL*
language
''
of
affection
,
which
Rosamond
,
though
not
returning
it
,
*NL*
accepted
as
if
she
had
been
a
serene
and
lovely
image
,
now
and
then
*NL*
miraculously
dimpling
towards
her
votary
.
With
such
fibres
still
astir
*NL*
in
him
,
the
shock
he
received
could
not
at
once
be
distinctly
anger
;
it
*NL*
was
confused
pain
.
He
laid
down
the
knife
and
fork
with
which
he
was
*NL*
carving
,
and
throwing
himself
back
in
his
chair
,
said
at
last
,
with
a
*NL*
cool
irony
in
his
tone
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
I
ask
when
and
why
you
did
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
I
knew
that
the
Plymdales
had
taken
a
house
,
I
called
to
tell
him
*NL*
not
to
mention
ours
to
them
;
and
at
the
same
time
I
told
him
not
to
let
*NL*
the
affair
go
on
any
further
.
I
knew
that
it
would
be
very
injurious
*NL*
to
you
if
it
were
known
that
you
wished
to
part
with
your
house
and
*NL*
furniture
,
and
I
had
a
very
strong
objection
to
it
.
I
think
that
was
*NL*
reason
enough
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
of
no
consequence
then
that
I
had
told
you
imperative
reasons
*NL*
of
another
kind
;
of
no
consequence
that
I
had
come
to
a
different
*NL*
conclusion
,
and
given
an
order
accordingly
?
''
said
Lydgate
,
bitingly
,
*NL*
the
thunder
and
lightning
gathering
about
his
brow
and
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
effect
of
any
one
's
anger
on
Rosamond
had
always
been
to
make
her
*NL*
shrink
in
cold
dislike
,
and
to
become
all
the
more
calmly
correct
,
in
*NL*
the
conviction
that
she
was
not
the
person
to
misbehave
whatever
others
*NL*
might
do
.
She
replied
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
had
a
perfect
right
to
speak
on
a
subject
which
concerns
me
*NL*
at
least
as
much
as
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Clearly
--
you
had
a
right
to
speak
,
but
only
to
me
.
You
had
no
right
*NL*
to
contradict
my
orders
secretly
,
and
treat
me
as
if
I
were
a
fool
,
''
*NL*
said
Lydgate
,
in
the
same
tone
as
before
.
Then
with
some
added
scorn
,
*NL*
``
Is
it
possible
to
make
you
understand
what
the
consequences
will
be
?
*NL*
Is
it
of
any
use
for
me
to
tell
you
again
why
we
must
try
to
part
with
*NL*
the
house
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
not
necessary
for
you
to
tell
me
again
,
''
said
Rosamond
,
in
a
*NL*
voice
that
fell
and
trickled
like
cold
water-drops
.
``
I
remembered
what
*NL*
you
said
.
You
spoke
just
as
violently
as
you
do
now
.
But
that
does
*NL*
not
alter
my
opinion
that
you
ought
to
try
every
other
means
rather
*NL*
than
take
a
step
which
is
so
painful
to
me
.
And
as
to
advertising
the
*NL*
house
,
I
think
it
would
be
perfectly
degrading
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
suppose
I
disregard
your
opinion
as
you
disregard
mine
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
do
so
,
of
course
.
But
I
think
you
ought
to
have
told
me
*NL*
before
we
were
married
that
you
would
place
me
in
the
worst
position
,
*NL*
rather
than
give
up
your
own
will
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lydgate
did
not
speak
,
but
tossed
his
head
on
one
side
,
and
twitched
*NL*
the
corners
of
his
mouth
in
despair
.
Rosamond
,
seeing
that
he
was
not
*NL*
looking
at
her
,
rose
and
set
his
cup
of
coffee
before
him
;
but
he
took
*NL*
no
notice
of
it
,
and
went
on
with
an
inward
drama
and
argument
,
*NL*
occasionally
moving
in
his
seat
,
resting
one
arm
on
the
table
,
and
*NL*
rubbing
his
hand
against
his
hair
.
There
was
a
conflux
of
emotions
and
*NL*
thoughts
in
him
that
would
not
let
him
either
give
thorough
way
to
his
*NL*
anger
or
persevere
with
simple
rigidity
of
resolve
.
Rosamond
took
*NL*
advantage
of
his
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
we
were
married
everyone
felt
that
your
position
was
very
high
.
*NL*
I
could
not
have
imagined
then
that
you
would
want
to
sell
our
*NL*
furniture
,
and
take
a
house
in
Bride
Street
,
where
the
rooms
are
like
*NL*
cages
.
If
we
are
to
live
in
that
way
let
us
at
least
leave
*NL*
Middlemarch
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
These
would
be
very
strong
considerations
,
''
said
Lydgate
,
half
*NL*
ironically
--
still
there
was
a
withered
paleness
about
his
lips
as
he
*NL*
looked
at
his
coffee
,
and
did
not
drink
--
``
these
would
be
very
strong
*NL*
considerations
if
I
did
not
happen
to
be
in
debt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Many
persons
must
have
been
in
debt
in
the
same
way
,
but
if
they
are
*NL*
respectable
,
people
trust
them
.
I
am
sure
I
have
heard
papa
say
that
*NL*
the
Torbits
were
in
debt
,
and
they
went
on
very
well
.
It
can
not
be
*NL*
good
to
act
rashly
,
''
said
Rosamond
,
with
serene
wisdom
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lydgate
sat
paralyzed
by
opposing
impulses
:
since
no
reasoning
he
could
*NL*
apply
to
Rosamond
seemed
likely
to
conquer
her
assent
,
he
wanted
to
*NL*
smash
and
grind
some
object
on
which
he
could
at
least
produce
an
*NL*
impression
,
or
else
to
tell
her
brutally
that
he
was
master
,
and
she
*NL*
must
obey
.
But
he
not
only
dreaded
the
effect
of
such
extremities
on
*NL*
their
mutual
life
--
he
had
a
growing
dread
of
Rosamond
's
quiet
elusive
*NL*
obstinacy
,
which
would
not
allow
any
assertion
of
power
to
be
final
;
*NL*
and
again
,
she
had
touched
him
in
a
spot
of
keenest
feeling
by
implying
*NL*
that
she
had
been
deluded
with
a
false
vision
of
happiness
in
marrying
*NL*
him
.
As
to
saying
that
he
was
master
,
it
was
not
the
fact
.
The
very
*NL*
resolution
to
which
he
had
wrought
himself
by
dint
of
logic
and
*NL*
honorable
pride
was
beginning
to
relax
under
her
torpedo
contact
.
He
*NL*
swallowed
half
his
cup
of
coffee
,
and
then
rose
to
go
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
may
at
least
request
that
you
will
not
go
to
Trumbull
at
*NL*
present
--
until
it
has
been
seen
that
there
are
no
other
means
,
''
said
*NL*
Rosamond
.
Although
she
was
not
subject
to
much
fear
,
she
felt
it
safer
*NL*
not
to
betray
that
she
had
written
to
Sir
Godwin
.
``
Promise
me
that
you
*NL*
will
not
go
to
him
for
a
few
weeks
,
or
without
telling
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lydgate
gave
a
short
laugh
.
``
I
think
it
is
I
who
should
exact
a
*NL*
promise
that
you
will
do
nothing
without
telling
me
,
''
he
said
,
turning
*NL*
his
eyes
sharply
upon
her
,
and
then
moving
to
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
remember
that
we
are
going
to
dine
at
papa
's
,
''
said
Rosamond
,
*NL*
wishing
that
he
should
turn
and
make
a
more
thorough
concession
to
her
.
*NL*
But
he
only
said
``
Oh
yes
,
''
impatiently
,
and
went
away
.
She
held
it
to
*NL*
be
very
odious
in
him
that
he
did
not
think
the
painful
propositions
he
*NL*
had
had
to
make
to
her
were
enough
,
without
showing
so
unpleasant
a
*NL*
temper
.
And
when
she
put
the
moderate
request
that
he
would
defer
*NL*
going
to
Trumbull
again
,
it
was
cruel
in
him
not
to
assure
her
of
what
*NL*
he
meant
to
do
.
She
was
convinced
of
her
having
acted
in
every
way
for
*NL*
the
best
;
and
each
grating
or
angry
speech
of
Lydgate
's
served
only
as
*NL*
an
addition
to
the
register
of
offences
in
her
mind
.
Poor
Rosamond
for
*NL*
months
had
begun
to
associate
her
husband
with
feelings
of
*NL*
disappointment
,
and
the
terribly
inflexible
relation
of
marriage
had
*NL*
lost
its
charm
of
encouraging
delightful
dreams
.
It
had
freed
her
from
*NL*
the
disagreeables
of
her
father
's
house
,
but
it
had
not
given
her
*NL*
everything
that
she
had
wished
and
hoped
.
The
Lydgate
with
whom
she
*NL*
had
been
in
love
had
been
a
group
of
airy
conditions
for
her
,
most
of
*NL*
which
had
disappeared
,
while
their
place
had
been
taken
by
every-day
*NL*
details
which
must
be
lived
through
slowly
from
hour
to
hour
,
not
*NL*
floated
through
with
a
rapid
selection
of
favorable
aspects
.
The
*NL*
habits
of
Lydgate
's
profession
,
his
home
preoccupation
with
scientific
*NL*
subjects
,
which
seemed
to
her
almost
like
a
morbid
vampire
's
taste
,
his
*NL*
peculiar
views
of
things
which
had
never
entered
into
the
dialogue
of
*NL*
courtship
--
all
these
continually
alienating
influences
,
even
without
*NL*
the
fact
of
his
having
placed
himself
at
a
disadvantage
in
the
town
,
*NL*
and
without
that
first
shock
of
revelation
about
Dover
's
debt
,
would
*NL*
have
made
his
presence
dull
to
her
.
There
was
another
presence
which
*NL*
ever
since
the
early
days
of
her
marriage
,
until
four
months
ago
,
had
*NL*
been
an
agreeable
excitement
,
but
that
was
gone
:
Rosamond
would
not
*NL*
confess
to
herself
how
much
the
consequent
blank
had
to
do
with
her
*NL*
utter
ennui
;
and
it
seemed
to
her
-LRB-
perhaps
she
was
right
-RRB-
that
an
*NL*
invitation
to
Quallingham
,
and
an
opening
for
Lydgate
to
settle
*NL*
elsewhere
than
in
Middlemarch
--
in
London
,
or
somewhere
likely
to
be
*NL*
free
from
unpleasantness
--
would
satisfy
her
quite
well
,
and
make
her
*NL*
indifferent
to
the
absence
of
Will
Ladislaw
,
towards
whom
she
felt
some
*NL*
resentment
for
his
exaltation
of
Mrs.
Casaubon
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
the
state
of
things
with
Lydgate
and
Rosamond
on
the
New
*NL*
Year
's
Day
when
they
dined
at
her
father
's
,
she
looking
mildly
neutral
*NL*
towards
him
in
remembrance
of
his
ill-tempered
behavior
at
breakfast
,
*NL*
and
he
carrying
a
much
deeper
effect
from
the
inward
conflict
in
which
*NL*
that
morning
scene
was
only
one
of
many
epochs
.
His
flushed
effort
*NL*
while
talking
to
Mr.
Farebrother
--
his
effort
after
the
cynical
pretence
*NL*
that
all
ways
of
getting
money
are
essentially
the
same
,
and
that
*NL*
chance
has
an
empire
which
reduces
choice
to
a
fool
's
illusion
--
was
but
*NL*
the
symptom
of
a
wavering
resolve
,
a
benumbed
response
to
the
old
*NL*
stimuli
of
enthusiasm
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
was
he
to
do
?
He
saw
even
more
keenly
than
Rosamond
did
the
*NL*
dreariness
of
taking
her
into
the
small
house
in
Bride
Street
,
where
*NL*
she
would
have
scanty
furniture
around
her
and
discontent
within
:
a
*NL*
life
of
privation
and
life
with
Rosamond
were
two
images
which
had
*NL*
become
more
and
more
irreconcilable
ever
since
the
threat
of
privation
*NL*
had
disclosed
itself
.
But
even
if
his
resolves
had
forced
the
two
*NL*
images
into
combination
,
the
useful
preliminaries
to
that
hard
change
*NL*
were
not
visibly
within
reach
.
And
though
he
had
not
given
the
promise
*NL*
which
his
wife
had
asked
for
,
he
did
not
go
again
to
Trumbull
.
He
even
*NL*
began
to
think
of
taking
a
rapid
journey
to
the
North
and
seeing
Sir
*NL*
Godwin
.
He
had
once
believed
that
nothing
would
urge
him
into
making
*NL*
an
application
for
money
to
his
uncle
,
but
he
had
not
then
known
the
*NL*
full
pressure
of
alternatives
yet
more
disagreeable
.
He
could
not
*NL*
depend
on
the
effect
of
a
letter
;
it
was
only
in
an
interview
,
however
*NL*
disagreeable
this
might
be
to
himself
,
that
he
could
give
a
thorough
*NL*
explanation
and
could
test
the
effectiveness
of
kinship
.
No
sooner
had
*NL*
Lydgate
begun
to
represent
this
step
to
himself
as
the
easiest
than
*NL*
there
was
a
reaction
of
anger
that
he
--
he
who
had
long
ago
determined
*NL*
to
live
aloof
from
such
abject
calculations
,
such
self-interested
*NL*
anxiety
about
the
inclinations
and
the
pockets
of
men
with
whom
he
had
*NL*
been
proud
to
have
no
aims
in
common
--
should
have
fallen
not
simply
to
*NL*
their
level
,
but
to
the
level
of
soliciting
them
.

The
bias
of
human
nature
to
be
slow
in
correspondence
triumphs
even
*NL*
over
the
present
quickening
in
the
general
pace
of
things
:
what
wonder
*NL*
then
that
in
1832
old
Sir
Godwin
Lydgate
was
slow
to
write
a
letter
*NL*
which
was
of
consequence
to
others
rather
than
to
himself
?
Nearly
*NL*
three
weeks
of
the
new
year
were
gone
,
and
Rosamond
,
awaiting
an
answer
*NL*
to
her
winning
appeal
,
was
every
day
disappointed
.
Lydgate
,
in
total
*NL*
ignorance
of
her
expectations
,
was
seeing
the
bills
come
in
,
and
*NL*
feeling
that
Dover
's
use
of
his
advantage
over
other
creditors
was
*NL*
imminent
.
He
had
never
mentioned
to
Rosamond
his
brooding
purpose
of
*NL*
going
to
Quallingham
:
he
did
not
want
to
admit
what
would
appear
to
her
*NL*
a
concession
to
her
wishes
after
indignant
refusal
,
until
the
last
*NL*
moment
;
but
he
was
really
expecting
to
set
off
soon
.
A
slice
of
the
*NL*
railway
would
enable
him
to
manage
the
whole
journey
and
back
in
four
*NL*
days
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
one
morning
after
Lydgate
had
gone
out
,
a
letter
came
addressed
to
*NL*
him
,
which
Rosamond
saw
clearly
to
be
from
Sir
Godwin
.
She
was
full
of
*NL*
hope
.
Perhaps
there
might
be
a
particular
note
to
her
enclosed
;
but
*NL*
Lydgate
was
naturally
addressed
on
the
question
of
money
or
other
aid
,
*NL*
and
the
fact
that
he
was
written
to
,
nay
,
the
very
delay
in
writing
at
*NL*
all
,
seemed
to
certify
that
the
answer
was
thoroughly
compliant
.
She
*NL*
was
too
much
excited
by
these
thoughts
to
do
anything
but
light
*NL*
stitching
in
a
warm
corner
of
the
dining-room
,
with
the
outside
of
this
*NL*
momentous
letter
lying
on
the
table
before
her
.
About
twelve
she
heard
*NL*
her
husband
's
step
in
the
passage
,
and
tripping
to
open
the
door
,
she
*NL*
said
in
her
lightest
tones
,
``
Tertius
,
come
in
here
--
here
is
a
letter
*NL*
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
?
''
he
said
,
not
taking
off
his
hat
,
but
just
turning
her
round
*NL*
within
his
arm
to
walk
towards
the
spot
where
the
letter
lay
.
``
My
*NL*
uncle
Godwin
!
''
he
exclaimed
,
while
Rosamond
reseated
herself
,
and
*NL*
watched
him
as
he
opened
the
letter
.
She
had
expected
him
to
be
*NL*
surprised
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
Lydgate
's
eyes
glanced
rapidly
over
the
brief
letter
,
she
saw
his
*NL*
face
,
usually
of
a
pale
brown
,
taking
on
a
dry
whiteness
;
with
nostrils
*NL*
and
lips
quivering
he
tossed
down
the
letter
before
her
,
and
said
*NL*
violently
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
will
be
impossible
to
endure
life
with
you
,
if
you
will
always
be
*NL*
acting
secretly
--
acting
in
opposition
to
me
and
hiding
your
actions
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
checked
his
speech
and
turned
his
back
on
her
--
then
wheeled
round
*NL*
and
walked
about
,
sat
down
,
and
got
up
again
restlessly
,
grasping
hard
*NL*
the
objects
deep
down
in
his
pockets
.
He
was
afraid
of
saying
*NL*
something
irremediably
cruel
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rosamond
too
had
changed
color
as
she
read
.
The
letter
ran
in
this
*NL*
way
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
DEAR
TERTIUS
,
--
Do
n't
set
your
wife
to
write
to
me
when
you
have
*NL*
anything
to
ask
.
It
is
a
roundabout
wheedling
sort
of
thing
which
I
*NL*
should
not
have
credited
you
with
.
I
never
choose
to
write
to
a
woman
*NL*
on
matters
of
business
.
As
to
my
supplying
you
with
a
thousand
pounds
,
*NL*
or
only
half
that
sum
,
I
can
do
nothing
of
the
sort
.
My
own
family
*NL*
drains
me
to
the
last
penny
.
With
two
younger
sons
and
three
*NL*
daughters
,
I
am
not
likely
to
have
cash
to
spare
.
You
seem
to
have
got
*NL*
through
your
own
money
pretty
quickly
,
and
to
have
made
a
mess
where
*NL*
you
are
;
the
sooner
you
go
somewhere
else
the
better
.
But
I
have
*NL*
nothing
to
do
with
men
of
your
profession
,
and
ca
n't
help
you
there
.
I
*NL*
did
the
best
I
could
for
you
as
guardian
,
and
let
you
have
your
own
way
*NL*
in
taking
to
medicine
.
You
might
have
gone
into
the
army
or
the
*NL*
Church
.
Your
money
would
have
held
out
for
that
,
and
there
would
have
*NL*
been
a
surer
ladder
before
you
.
Your
uncle
Charles
has
had
a
grudge
*NL*
against
you
for
not
going
into
his
profession
,
but
not
I.
I
have
always
*NL*
wished
you
well
,
but
you
must
consider
yourself
on
your
own
legs
*NL*
entirely
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
Your
affectionate
uncle
,
*NL*
GODWIN
LYDGATE
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
Rosamond
had
finished
reading
the
letter
she
sat
quite
still
,
with
*NL*
her
hands
folded
before
her
,
restraining
any
show
of
her
keen
*NL*
disappointment
,
and
intrenching
herself
in
quiet
passivity
under
her
*NL*
husband
's
wrath
.
Lydgate
paused
in
his
movements
,
looked
at
her
again
,
*NL*
and
said
,
with
biting
severity
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
this
be
enough
to
convince
you
of
the
harm
you
may
do
by
secret
*NL*
meddling
?
Have
you
sense
enough
to
recognize
now
your
incompetence
to
*NL*
judge
and
act
for
me
--
to
interfere
with
your
ignorance
in
affairs
which
*NL*
it
belongs
to
me
to
decide
on
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
words
were
hard
;
but
this
was
not
the
first
time
that
Lydgate
had
*NL*
been
frustrated
by
her
.
She
did
not
look
at
him
,
and
made
no
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
nearly
resolved
on
going
to
Quallingham
.
It
would
have
cost
me
*NL*
pain
enough
to
do
it
,
yet
it
might
have
been
of
some
use
.
But
it
has
*NL*
been
of
no
use
for
me
to
think
of
anything
.
You
have
always
been
*NL*
counteracting
me
secretly
.
You
delude
me
with
a
false
assent
,
and
then
*NL*
I
am
at
the
mercy
of
your
devices
.
If
you
mean
to
resist
every
wish
I
*NL*
express
,
say
so
and
defy
me
.
I
shall
at
least
know
what
I
am
doing
*NL*
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
a
terrible
moment
in
young
lives
when
the
closeness
of
love
's
*NL*
bond
has
turned
to
this
power
of
galling
.
In
spite
of
Rosamond
's
*NL*
self-control
a
tear
fell
silently
and
rolled
over
her
lips
.
She
still
*NL*
said
nothing
;
but
under
that
quietude
was
hidden
an
intense
effect
:
she
*NL*
was
in
such
entire
disgust
with
her
husband
that
she
wished
she
had
*NL*
never
seen
him
.
Sir
Godwin
's
rudeness
towards
her
and
utter
want
of
*NL*
feeling
ranged
him
with
Dover
and
all
other
creditors
--
disagreeable
*NL*
people
who
only
thought
of
themselves
,
and
did
not
mind
how
annoying
*NL*
they
were
to
her
.
Even
her
father
was
unkind
,
and
might
have
done
more
*NL*
for
them
.
In
fact
there
was
but
one
person
in
Rosamond
's
world
whom
*NL*
she
did
not
regard
as
blameworthy
,
and
that
was
the
graceful
creature
*NL*
with
blond
plaits
and
with
little
hands
crossed
before
her
,
who
had
*NL*
never
expressed
herself
unbecomingly
,
and
had
always
acted
for
the
*NL*
best
--
the
best
naturally
being
what
she
best
liked
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lydgate
pausing
and
looking
at
her
began
to
feel
that
half-maddening
*NL*
sense
of
helplessness
which
comes
over
passionate
people
when
their
*NL*
passion
is
met
by
an
innocent-looking
silence
whose
meek
victimized
air
*NL*
seems
to
put
them
in
the
wrong
,
and
at
last
infects
even
the
justest
*NL*
indignation
with
a
doubt
of
its
justice
.
He
needed
to
recover
the
full
*NL*
sense
that
he
was
in
the
right
by
moderating
his
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
you
not
see
,
Rosamond
,
''
he
began
again
,
trying
to
be
simply
grave
*NL*
and
not
bitter
,
``
that
nothing
can
be
so
fatal
as
a
want
of
openness
and
*NL*
confidence
between
us
?
It
has
happened
again
and
again
that
I
have
*NL*
expressed
a
decided
wish
,
and
you
have
seemed
to
assent
,
yet
after
that
*NL*
you
have
secretly
disobeyed
my
wish
.
In
that
way
I
can
never
know
what
*NL*
I
have
to
trust
to
.
There
would
be
some
hope
for
us
if
you
would
admit
*NL*
this
.
Am
I
such
an
unreasonable
,
furious
brute
?
Why
should
you
not
be
*NL*
open
with
me
?
''
Still
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
only
say
that
you
have
been
mistaken
,
and
that
I
may
depend
*NL*
on
your
not
acting
secretly
in
future
?
''
said
Lydgate
,
urgently
,
but
*NL*
with
something
of
request
in
his
tone
which
Rosamond
was
quick
to
*NL*
perceive
.
She
spoke
with
coolness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
possibly
make
admissions
or
promises
in
answer
to
such
words
*NL*
as
you
have
used
towards
me
.
I
have
not
been
accustomed
to
language
of
*NL*
that
kind
.
You
have
spoken
of
my
`
secret
meddling
,
'
and
my
*NL*
`
interfering
ignorance
,
'
and
my
`
false
assent
.
'
I
have
never
expressed
*NL*
myself
in
that
way
to
you
,
and
I
think
that
you
ought
to
apologize
.
*NL*
You
spoke
of
its
being
impossible
to
live
with
me
.
Certainly
you
have
*NL*
not
made
my
life
pleasant
to
me
of
late
.
I
think
it
was
to
be
expected
*NL*
that
I
should
try
to
avert
some
of
the
hardships
which
our
marriage
has
*NL*
brought
on
me
.
''
Another
tear
fell
as
Rosamond
ceased
speaking
,
and
she
*NL*
pressed
it
away
as
quietly
as
the
first
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lydgate
flung
himself
into
a
chair
,
feeling
checkmated
.
What
place
was
*NL*
there
in
her
mind
for
a
remonstrance
to
lodge
in
?
He
laid
down
his
*NL*
hat
,
flung
an
arm
over
the
back
of
his
chair
,
and
looked
down
for
some
*NL*
moments
without
speaking
.
Rosamond
had
the
double
purchase
over
him
of
*NL*
insensibility
to
the
point
of
justice
in
his
reproach
,
and
of
*NL*
sensibility
to
the
undeniable
hardships
now
present
in
her
married
*NL*
life
.
Although
her
duplicity
in
the
affair
of
the
house
had
exceeded
*NL*
what
he
knew
,
and
had
really
hindered
the
Plymdales
from
knowing
of
it
,
*NL*
she
had
no
consciousness
that
her
action
could
rightly
be
called
false
.
*NL*
We
are
not
obliged
to
identify
our
own
acts
according
to
a
strict
*NL*
classification
,
any
more
than
the
materials
of
our
grocery
and
clothes
.
*NL*
Rosamond
felt
that
she
was
aggrieved
,
and
that
this
was
what
Lydgate
*NL*
had
to
recognize
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
him
,
the
need
of
accommodating
himself
to
her
nature
,
which
was
*NL*
inflexible
in
proportion
to
its
negations
,
held
him
as
with
pincers
.
*NL*
He
had
begun
to
have
an
alarmed
foresight
of
her
irrevocable
loss
of
*NL*
love
for
him
,
and
the
consequent
dreariness
of
their
life
.
The
ready
*NL*
fulness
of
his
emotions
made
this
dread
alternate
quickly
with
the
*NL*
first
violent
movements
of
his
anger
.
It
would
assuredly
have
been
a
*NL*
vain
boast
in
him
to
say
that
he
was
her
master
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
not
made
my
life
pleasant
to
me
of
late
''
--
``
the
hardships
*NL*
which
our
marriage
has
brought
on
me
''
--
these
words
were
stinging
his
*NL*
imagination
as
a
pain
makes
an
exaggerated
dream
.
If
he
were
not
only
*NL*
to
sink
from
his
highest
resolve
,
but
to
sink
into
the
hideous
*NL*
fettering
of
domestic
hate
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rosamond
,
''
he
said
,
turning
his
eyes
on
her
with
a
melancholy
look
,
*NL*
``
you
should
allow
for
a
man
's
words
when
he
is
disappointed
and
*NL*
provoked
.
You
and
I
can
not
have
opposite
interests
.
I
can
not
part
my
*NL*
happiness
from
yours
.
If
I
am
angry
with
you
,
it
is
that
you
seem
not
*NL*
to
see
how
any
concealment
divides
us
.
How
could
I
wish
to
make
*NL*
anything
hard
to
you
either
by
my
words
or
conduct
?
When
I
hurt
you
,
I
*NL*
hurt
part
of
my
own
life
.
I
should
never
be
angry
with
you
if
you
*NL*
would
be
quite
open
with
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
only
wished
to
prevent
you
from
hurrying
us
into
wretchedness
*NL*
without
any
necessity
,
''
said
Rosamond
,
the
tears
coming
again
from
a
*NL*
softened
feeling
now
that
her
husband
had
softened
.
``
It
is
so
very
*NL*
hard
to
be
disgraced
here
among
all
the
people
we
know
,
and
to
live
in
*NL*
such
a
miserable
way
.
I
wish
I
had
died
with
the
baby
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
spoke
and
wept
with
that
gentleness
which
makes
such
words
and
*NL*
tears
omnipotent
over
a
loving-hearted
man
.
Lydgate
drew
his
chair
*NL*
near
to
hers
and
pressed
her
delicate
head
against
his
cheek
with
his
*NL*
powerful
tender
hand
.
He
only
caressed
her
;
he
did
not
say
anything
;
*NL*
for
what
was
there
to
say
?
He
could
not
promise
to
shield
her
from
the
*NL*
dreaded
wretchedness
,
for
he
could
see
no
sure
means
of
doing
so
.
When
*NL*
he
left
her
to
go
out
again
,
he
told
himself
that
it
was
ten
times
*NL*
harder
for
her
than
for
him
:
he
had
a
life
away
from
home
,
and
constant
*NL*
appeals
to
his
activity
on
behalf
of
others
.
He
wished
to
excuse
*NL*
everything
in
her
if
he
could
--
but
it
was
inevitable
that
in
that
*NL*
excusing
mood
he
should
think
of
her
as
if
she
were
an
animal
of
*NL*
another
and
feebler
species
.
Nevertheless
she
had
mastered
him
.

Measure
for
Measure
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Lydgate
certainly
had
good
reason
to
reflect
on
the
service
his
*NL*
practice
did
him
in
counteracting
his
personal
cares
.
He
had
no
longer
*NL*
free
energy
enough
for
spontaneous
research
and
speculative
thinking
,
*NL*
but
by
the
bedside
of
patients
,
the
direct
external
calls
on
his
*NL*
judgment
and
sympathies
brought
the
added
impulse
needed
to
draw
him
*NL*
out
of
himself
.
It
was
not
simply
that
beneficent
harness
of
routine
*NL*
which
enables
silly
men
to
live
respectably
and
unhappy
men
to
live
*NL*
calmly
--
it
was
a
perpetual
claim
on
the
immediate
fresh
application
of
*NL*
thought
,
and
on
the
consideration
of
another
's
need
and
trial
.
Many
of
*NL*
us
looking
back
through
life
would
say
that
the
kindest
man
we
have
*NL*
ever
known
has
been
a
medical
man
,
or
perhaps
that
surgeon
whose
fine
*NL*
tact
,
directed
by
deeply
informed
perception
,
has
come
to
us
in
our
*NL*
need
with
a
more
sublime
beneficence
than
that
of
miracle-workers
.
Some
*NL*
of
that
twice-blessed
mercy
was
always
with
Lydgate
in
his
work
at
the
*NL*
Hospital
or
in
private
houses
,
serving
better
than
any
opiate
to
quiet
*NL*
and
sustain
him
under
his
anxieties
and
his
sense
of
mental
degeneracy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Farebrother
's
suspicion
as
to
the
opiate
was
true
,
however
.
Under
*NL*
the
first
galling
pressure
of
foreseen
difficulties
,
and
the
first
*NL*
perception
that
his
marriage
,
if
it
were
not
to
be
a
yoked
loneliness
,
*NL*
must
be
a
state
of
effort
to
go
on
loving
without
too
much
care
about
*NL*
being
loved
,
he
had
once
or
twice
tried
a
dose
of
opium
.
But
he
had
no
*NL*
hereditary
constitutional
craving
after
such
transient
escapes
from
the
*NL*
hauntings
of
misery
.
He
was
strong
,
could
drink
a
great
deal
of
wine
,
*NL*
but
did
not
care
about
it
;
and
when
the
men
round
him
were
drinking
*NL*
spirits
,
he
took
sugar
and
water
,
having
a
contemptuous
pity
even
for
*NL*
the
earliest
stages
of
excitement
from
drink
.
It
was
the
same
with
*NL*
gambling
.
He
had
looked
on
at
a
great
deal
of
gambling
in
Paris
,
*NL*
watching
it
as
if
it
had
been
a
disease
.
He
was
no
more
tempted
by
*NL*
such
winning
than
he
was
by
drink
.
He
had
said
to
himself
that
the
*NL*
only
winning
he
cared
for
must
be
attained
by
a
conscious
process
of
*NL*
high
,
difficult
combination
tending
towards
a
beneficent
result
.
The
*NL*
power
he
longed
for
could
not
be
represented
by
agitated
fingers
*NL*
clutching
a
heap
of
coin
,
or
by
the
half-barbarous
,
half-idiotic
*NL*
triumph
in
the
eyes
of
a
man
who
sweeps
within
his
arms
the
ventures
of
*NL*
twenty
chapfallen
companions
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
just
as
he
had
tried
opium
,
so
his
thought
now
began
to
turn
upon
*NL*
gambling
--
not
with
appetite
for
its
excitement
,
but
with
a
sort
of
*NL*
wistful
inward
gaze
after
that
easy
way
of
getting
money
,
which
implied
*NL*
no
asking
and
brought
no
responsibility
.
If
he
had
been
in
London
or
*NL*
Paris
at
that
time
,
it
is
probable
that
such
thoughts
,
seconded
by
*NL*
opportunity
,
would
have
taken
him
into
a
gambling-house
,
no
longer
to
*NL*
watch
the
gamblers
,
but
to
watch
with
them
in
kindred
eagerness
.
*NL*
Repugnance
would
have
been
surmounted
by
the
immense
need
to
win
,
if
*NL*
chance
would
be
kind
enough
to
let
him
.
An
incident
which
happened
not
*NL*
very
long
after
that
airy
notion
of
getting
aid
from
his
uncle
had
been
*NL*
excluded
,
was
a
strong
sign
of
the
effect
that
might
have
followed
any
*NL*
extant
opportunity
of
gambling
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
billiard-room
at
the
Green
Dragon
was
the
constant
resort
of
a
*NL*
certain
set
,
most
of
whom
,
like
our
acquaintance
Mr.
Bambridge
,
were
*NL*
regarded
as
men
of
pleasure
.
It
was
here
that
poor
Fred
Vincy
had
made
*NL*
part
of
his
memorable
debt
,
having
lost
money
in
betting
,
and
been
*NL*
obliged
to
borrow
of
that
gay
companion
.
It
was
generally
known
in
*NL*
Middlemarch
that
a
good
deal
of
money
was
lost
and
won
in
this
way
;
and
*NL*
the
consequent
repute
of
the
Green
Dragon
as
a
place
of
dissipation
*NL*
naturally
heightened
in
some
quarters
the
temptation
to
go
there
.
*NL*
Probably
its
regular
visitants
,
like
the
initiates
of
freemasonry
,
*NL*
wished
that
there
were
something
a
little
more
tremendous
to
keep
to
*NL*
themselves
concerning
it
;
but
they
were
not
a
closed
community
,
and
*NL*
many
decent
seniors
as
well
as
juniors
occasionally
turned
into
the
*NL*
billiard-room
to
see
what
was
going
on
.
Lydgate
,
who
had
the
muscular
*NL*
aptitude
for
billiards
,
and
was
fond
of
the
game
,
had
once
or
twice
in
*NL*
the
early
days
after
his
arrival
in
Middlemarch
taken
his
turn
with
the
*NL*
cue
at
the
Green
Dragon
;
but
afterwards
he
had
no
leisure
for
the
game
,
*NL*
and
no
inclination
for
the
socialities
there
.
One
evening
,
however
,
he
*NL*
had
occasion
to
seek
Mr.
Bambridge
at
that
resort
.
The
horsedealer
had
*NL*
engaged
to
get
him
a
customer
for
his
remaining
good
horse
,
for
which
*NL*
Lydgate
had
determined
to
substitute
a
cheap
hack
,
hoping
by
this
*NL*
reduction
of
style
to
get
perhaps
twenty
pounds
;
and
he
cared
now
for
*NL*
every
small
sum
,
as
a
help
towards
feeding
the
patience
of
his
*NL*
tradesmen
.
To
run
up
to
the
billiard-room
,
as
he
was
passing
,
would
*NL*
save
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bambridge
was
not
yet
come
,
but
would
be
sure
to
arrive
by-and-by
,
*NL*
said
his
friend
Mr.
Horrock
;
and
Lydgate
stayed
,
playing
a
game
for
the
*NL*
sake
of
passing
the
time
.
That
evening
he
had
the
peculiar
light
in
*NL*
the
eyes
and
the
unusual
vivacity
which
had
been
once
noticed
in
him
by
*NL*
Mr.
Farebrother
.
The
exceptional
fact
of
his
presence
was
much
noticed
*NL*
in
the
room
,
where
there
was
a
good
deal
of
Middlemarch
company
;
and
*NL*
several
lookers-on
,
as
well
as
some
of
the
players
,
were
betting
with
*NL*
animation
.
Lydgate
was
playing
well
,
and
felt
confident
;
the
bets
were
*NL*
dropping
round
him
,
and
with
a
swift
glancing
thought
of
the
probable
*NL*
gain
which
might
double
the
sum
he
was
saving
from
his
horse
,
he
began
*NL*
to
bet
on
his
own
play
,
and
won
again
and
again
.
Mr.
Bambridge
had
*NL*
come
in
,
but
Lydgate
did
not
notice
him
.
He
was
not
only
excited
with
*NL*
his
play
,
but
visions
were
gleaming
on
him
of
going
the
next
day
to
*NL*
Brassing
,
where
there
was
gambling
on
a
grander
scale
to
be
had
,
and
*NL*
where
,
by
one
powerful
snatch
at
the
devil
's
bait
,
he
might
carry
it
*NL*
off
without
the
hook
,
and
buy
his
rescue
from
his
daily
solicitings
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
still
winning
when
two
new
visitors
entered
.
One
of
them
was
a
*NL*
young
Hawley
,
just
come
from
his
law
studies
in
town
,
and
the
other
was
*NL*
Fred
Vincy
,
who
had
spent
several
evenings
of
late
at
this
old
haunt
of
*NL*
his
.
Young
Hawley
,
an
accomplished
billiard-player
,
brought
a
cool
*NL*
fresh
hand
to
the
cue
.
But
Fred
Vincy
,
startled
at
seeing
Lydgate
,
and
*NL*
astonished
to
see
him
betting
with
an
excited
air
,
stood
aside
,
and
*NL*
kept
out
of
the
circle
round
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fred
had
been
rewarding
resolution
by
a
little
laxity
of
late
.
He
had
*NL*
been
working
heartily
for
six
months
at
all
outdoor
occupations
under
*NL*
Mr.
Garth
,
and
by
dint
of
severe
practice
had
nearly
mastered
the
*NL*
defects
of
his
handwriting
,
this
practice
being
,
perhaps
,
a
little
the
*NL*
less
severe
that
it
was
often
carried
on
in
the
evening
at
Mr.
Garth
's
*NL*
under
the
eyes
of
Mary
.
But
the
last
fortnight
Mary
had
been
staying
*NL*
at
Lowick
Parsonage
with
the
ladies
there
,
during
Mr.
Farebrother
's
*NL*
residence
in
Middlemarch
,
where
he
was
carrying
out
some
parochial
*NL*
plans
;
and
Fred
,
not
seeing
anything
more
agreeable
to
do
,
had
turned
*NL*
into
the
Green
Dragon
,
partly
to
play
at
billiards
,
partly
to
taste
the
*NL*
old
flavor
of
discourse
about
horses
,
sport
,
and
things
in
general
,
*NL*
considered
from
a
point
of
view
which
was
not
strenuously
correct
.
He
*NL*
had
not
been
out
hunting
once
this
season
,
had
had
no
horse
of
his
own
*NL*
to
ride
,
and
had
gone
from
place
to
place
chiefly
with
Mr.
Garth
in
his
*NL*
gig
,
or
on
the
sober
cob
which
Mr.
Garth
could
lend
him
.
It
was
a
*NL*
little
too
bad
,
Fred
began
to
think
,
that
he
should
be
kept
in
the
*NL*
traces
with
more
severity
than
if
he
had
been
a
clergyman
.
``
I
will
*NL*
tell
you
what
,
Mistress
Mary
--
it
will
be
rather
harder
work
to
learn
*NL*
surveying
and
drawing
plans
than
it
would
have
been
to
write
sermons
,
''
*NL*
he
had
said
,
wishing
her
to
appreciate
what
he
went
through
for
her
*NL*
sake
;
``
and
as
to
Hercules
and
Theseus
,
they
were
nothing
to
me
.
They
*NL*
had
sport
,
and
never
learned
to
write
a
bookkeeping
hand
.
''
And
now
,
*NL*
Mary
being
out
of
the
way
for
a
little
while
,
Fred
,
like
any
other
*NL*
strong
dog
who
can
not
slip
his
collar
,
had
pulled
up
the
staple
of
his
*NL*
chain
and
made
a
small
escape
,
not
of
course
meaning
to
go
fast
or
far
.
*NL*
There
could
be
no
reason
why
he
should
not
play
at
billiards
,
but
he
*NL*
was
determined
not
to
bet
.
As
to
money
just
now
,
Fred
had
in
his
mind
*NL*
the
heroic
project
of
saving
almost
all
of
the
eighty
pounds
that
Mr.
*NL*
Garth
offered
him
,
and
returning
it
,
which
he
could
easily
do
by
giving
*NL*
up
all
futile
money-spending
,
since
he
had
a
superfluous
stock
of
*NL*
clothes
,
and
no
expense
in
his
board
.
In
that
way
he
could
,
in
one
*NL*
year
,
go
a
good
way
towards
repaying
the
ninety
pounds
of
which
he
had
*NL*
deprived
Mrs.
Garth
,
unhappily
at
a
time
when
she
needed
that
sum
more
*NL*
than
she
did
now
.
Nevertheless
,
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
on
this
*NL*
evening
,
which
was
the
fifth
of
his
recent
visits
to
the
billiard-room
,
*NL*
Fred
had
,
not
in
his
pocket
,
but
in
his
mind
,
the
ten
pounds
which
he
*NL*
meant
to
reserve
for
himself
from
his
half-year
's
salary
-LRB-
having
before
*NL*
him
the
pleasure
of
carrying
thirty
to
Mrs.
Garth
when
Mary
was
likely
*NL*
to
be
come
home
again
-RRB-
--
he
had
those
ten
pounds
in
his
mind
as
a
fund
*NL*
from
which
he
might
risk
something
,
if
there
were
a
chance
of
a
good
*NL*
bet
.
Why
?
Well
,
when
sovereigns
were
flying
about
,
why
should
n't
he
*NL*
catch
a
few
?
He
would
never
go
far
along
that
road
again
;
but
a
man
*NL*
likes
to
assure
himself
,
and
men
of
pleasure
generally
,
what
he
could
*NL*
do
in
the
way
of
mischief
if
he
chose
,
and
that
if
he
abstains
from
*NL*
making
himself
ill
,
or
beggaring
himself
,
or
talking
with
the
utmost
*NL*
looseness
which
the
narrow
limits
of
human
capacity
will
allow
,
it
is
*NL*
not
because
he
is
a
spooney
.
Fred
did
not
enter
into
formal
reasons
,
*NL*
which
are
a
very
artificial
,
inexact
way
of
representing
the
tingling
*NL*
returns
of
old
habit
,
and
the
caprices
of
young
blood
:
but
there
was
*NL*
lurking
in
him
a
prophetic
sense
that
evening
,
that
when
he
began
to
*NL*
play
he
should
also
begin
to
bet
--
that
he
should
enjoy
some
*NL*
punch-drinking
,
and
in
general
prepare
himself
for
feeling
``
rather
*NL*
seedy
''
in
the
morning
.
It
is
in
such
indefinable
movements
that
action
*NL*
often
begins
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
last
thing
likely
to
have
entered
Fred
's
expectation
was
that
*NL*
he
should
see
his
brother-in-law
Lydgate
--
of
whom
he
had
never
quite
*NL*
dropped
the
old
opinion
that
he
was
a
prig
,
and
tremendously
conscious
*NL*
of
his
superiority
--
looking
excited
and
betting
,
just
as
he
himself
*NL*
might
have
done
.
Fred
felt
a
shock
greater
than
he
could
quite
account
*NL*
for
by
the
vague
knowledge
that
Lydgate
was
in
debt
,
and
that
his
*NL*
father
had
refused
to
help
him
;
and
his
own
inclination
to
enter
into
*NL*
the
play
was
suddenly
checked
.
It
was
a
strange
reversal
of
attitudes
:
*NL*
Fred
's
blond
face
and
blue
eyes
,
usually
bright
and
careless
,
ready
to
*NL*
give
attention
to
anything
that
held
out
a
promise
of
amusement
,
*NL*
looking
involuntarily
grave
and
almost
embarrassed
as
if
by
the
sight
*NL*
of
something
unfitting
;
while
Lydgate
,
who
had
habitually
an
air
of
*NL*
self-possessed
strength
,
and
a
certain
meditativeness
that
seemed
to
*NL*
lie
behind
his
most
observant
attention
,
was
acting
,
watching
,
speaking
*NL*
with
that
excited
narrow
consciousness
which
reminds
one
of
an
animal
*NL*
with
fierce
eyes
and
retractile
claws
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lydgate
,
by
betting
on
his
own
strokes
,
had
won
sixteen
pounds
;
but
*NL*
young
Hawley
's
arrival
had
changed
the
poise
of
things
.
He
made
*NL*
first-rate
strokes
himself
,
and
began
to
bet
against
Lydgate
's
strokes
,
*NL*
the
strain
of
whose
nerves
was
thus
changed
from
simple
confidence
in
*NL*
his
own
movements
to
defying
another
person
's
doubt
in
them
.
The
*NL*
defiance
was
more
exciting
than
the
confidence
,
but
it
was
less
sure
.
*NL*
He
continued
to
bet
on
his
own
play
,
but
began
often
to
fail
.
Still
he
*NL*
went
on
,
for
his
mind
was
as
utterly
narrowed
into
that
precipitous
*NL*
crevice
of
play
as
if
he
had
been
the
most
ignorant
lounger
there
.
*NL*
Fred
observed
that
Lydgate
was
losing
fast
,
and
found
himself
in
the
*NL*
new
situation
of
puzzling
his
brains
to
think
of
some
device
by
which
,
*NL*
without
being
offensive
,
he
could
withdraw
Lydgate
's
attention
,
and
*NL*
perhaps
suggest
to
him
a
reason
for
quitting
the
room
.
He
saw
that
*NL*
others
were
observing
Lydgate
's
strange
unlikeness
to
himself
,
and
it
*NL*
occurred
to
him
that
merely
to
touch
his
elbow
and
call
him
aside
for
a
*NL*
moment
might
rouse
him
from
his
absorption
.
He
could
think
of
nothing
*NL*
cleverer
than
the
daring
improbability
of
saying
that
he
wanted
to
see
*NL*
Rosy
,
and
wished
to
know
if
she
were
at
home
this
evening
;
and
he
was
*NL*
going
desperately
to
carry
out
this
weak
device
,
when
a
waiter
came
up
*NL*
to
him
with
a
message
,
saying
that
Mr.
Farebrother
was
below
,
and
*NL*
begged
to
speak
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fred
was
surprised
,
not
quite
comfortably
,
but
sending
word
that
he
*NL*
would
be
down
immediately
,
he
went
with
a
new
impulse
up
to
Lydgate
,
*NL*
said
,
``
Can
I
speak
to
you
a
moment
?
''
and
drew
him
aside
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Farebrother
has
just
sent
up
a
message
to
say
that
he
wants
to
speak
*NL*
to
me
.
He
is
below
.
I
thought
you
might
like
to
know
he
was
there
,
if
*NL*
you
had
anything
to
say
to
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fred
had
simply
snatched
up
this
pretext
for
speaking
,
because
he
could
*NL*
not
say
,
``
You
are
losing
confoundedly
,
and
are
making
everybody
stare
*NL*
at
you
;
you
had
better
come
away
.
''
But
inspiration
could
hardly
have
*NL*
served
him
better
.
Lydgate
had
not
before
seen
that
Fred
was
present
,
*NL*
and
his
sudden
appearance
with
an
announcement
of
Mr.
Farebrother
had
*NL*
the
effect
of
a
sharp
concussion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
''
said
Lydgate
;
``
I
have
nothing
particular
to
say
to
him
.
*NL*
But
--
the
game
is
up
--
I
must
be
going
--
I
came
in
just
to
see
Bambridge
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bambridge
is
over
there
,
but
he
is
making
a
row
--
I
do
n't
think
he
's
*NL*
ready
for
business
.
Come
down
with
me
to
Farebrother
.
I
expect
he
is
*NL*
going
to
blow
me
up
,
and
you
will
shield
me
,
''
said
Fred
,
with
some
*NL*
adroitness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lydgate
felt
shame
,
but
could
not
bear
to
act
as
if
he
felt
it
,
by
*NL*
refusing
to
see
Mr.
Farebrother
;
and
he
went
down
.
They
merely
shook
*NL*
hands
,
however
,
and
spoke
of
the
frost
;
and
when
all
three
had
turned
*NL*
into
the
street
,
the
Vicar
seemed
quite
willing
to
say
good-by
to
*NL*
Lydgate
.
His
present
purpose
was
clearly
to
talk
with
Fred
alone
,
and
*NL*
he
said
,
kindly
,
``
I
disturbed
you
,
young
gentleman
,
because
I
have
some
*NL*
pressing
business
with
you
.
Walk
with
me
to
St.
Botolph
's
,
will
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
fine
night
,
the
sky
thick
with
stars
,
and
Mr.
Farebrother
*NL*
proposed
that
they
should
make
a
circuit
to
the
old
church
by
the
*NL*
London
road
.
The
next
thing
he
said
was
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
Lydgate
never
went
to
the
Green
Dragon
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
did
I
,
''
said
Fred
.
``
But
he
said
that
he
went
to
see
Bambridge
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
was
not
playing
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fred
had
not
meant
to
tell
this
,
but
he
was
obliged
now
to
say
,
``
Yes
,
*NL*
he
was
.
But
I
suppose
it
was
an
accidental
thing
.
I
have
never
seen
*NL*
him
there
before
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
been
going
often
yourself
,
then
,
lately
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
about
five
or
six
times
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
you
had
some
good
reason
for
giving
up
the
habit
of
going
*NL*
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
You
know
all
about
it
,
''
said
Fred
,
not
liking
to
be
catechised
*NL*
in
this
way
.
``
I
made
a
clean
breast
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
that
gives
me
a
warrant
to
speak
about
the
matter
now
.
It
*NL*
is
understood
between
us
,
is
it
not
?
--
that
we
are
on
a
footing
of
open
*NL*
friendship
:
I
have
listened
to
you
,
and
you
will
be
willing
to
listen
*NL*
to
me
.
I
may
take
my
turn
in
talking
a
little
about
myself
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
under
the
deepest
obligation
to
you
,
Mr.
Farebrother
,
''
said
Fred
,
*NL*
in
a
state
of
uncomfortable
surmise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
not
affect
to
deny
that
you
are
under
some
obligation
to
me
.
*NL*
But
I
am
going
to
confess
to
you
,
Fred
,
that
I
have
been
tempted
to
*NL*
reverse
all
that
by
keeping
silence
with
you
just
now
.
When
somebody
*NL*
said
to
me
,
`
Young
Vincy
has
taken
to
being
at
the
billiard-table
every
*NL*
night
again
--
he
wo
n't
bear
the
curb
long
;
'
I
was
tempted
to
do
the
*NL*
opposite
of
what
I
am
doing
--
to
hold
my
tongue
and
wait
while
you
went
*NL*
down
the
ladder
again
,
betting
first
and
then
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
not
made
any
bets
,
''
said
Fred
,
hastily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Glad
to
hear
it
.
But
I
say
,
my
prompting
was
to
look
on
and
see
you
*NL*
take
the
wrong
turning
,
wear
out
Garth
's
patience
,
and
lose
the
best
*NL*
opportunity
of
your
life
--
the
opportunity
which
you
made
some
rather
*NL*
difficult
effort
to
secure
.
You
can
guess
the
feeling
which
raised
*NL*
that
temptation
in
me
--
I
am
sure
you
know
it
.
I
am
sure
you
know
that
*NL*
the
satisfaction
of
your
affections
stands
in
the
way
of
mine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
pause
.
Mr.
Farebrother
seemed
to
wait
for
a
recognition
of
*NL*
the
fact
;
and
the
emotion
perceptible
in
the
tones
of
his
fine
voice
*NL*
gave
solemnity
to
his
words
.
But
no
feeling
could
quell
Fred
's
alarm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
not
be
expected
to
give
her
up
,
''
he
said
,
after
a
moment
's
*NL*
hesitation
:
it
was
not
a
case
for
any
pretence
of
generosity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Clearly
not
,
when
her
affection
met
yours
.
But
relations
of
this
*NL*
sort
,
even
when
they
are
of
long
standing
,
are
always
liable
to
change
.
*NL*
I
can
easily
conceive
that
you
might
act
in
a
way
to
loosen
the
tie
she
*NL*
feels
towards
you
--
it
must
be
remembered
that
she
is
only
conditionally
*NL*
bound
to
you
--
and
that
in
that
case
,
another
man
,
who
may
flatter
*NL*
himself
that
he
has
a
hold
on
her
regard
,
might
succeed
in
winning
that
*NL*
firm
place
in
her
love
as
well
as
respect
which
you
had
let
slip
.
I
*NL*
can
easily
conceive
such
a
result
,
''
repeated
Mr.
Farebrother
,
*NL*
emphatically
.
``
There
is
a
companionship
of
ready
sympathy
,
which
might
*NL*
get
the
advantage
even
over
the
longest
associations
.
''
It
seemed
to
*NL*
Fred
that
if
Mr.
Farebrother
had
had
a
beak
and
talons
instead
of
his
*NL*
very
capable
tongue
,
his
mode
of
attack
could
hardly
be
more
cruel
.
He
*NL*
had
a
horrible
conviction
that
behind
all
this
hypothetic
statement
*NL*
there
was
a
knowledge
of
some
actual
change
in
Mary
's
feeling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
I
know
it
might
easily
be
all
up
with
me
,
''
he
said
,
in
a
*NL*
troubled
voice
.
``
If
she
is
beginning
to
compare
--
''
He
broke
off
,
not
*NL*
liking
to
betray
all
he
felt
,
and
then
said
,
by
the
help
of
a
little
*NL*
bitterness
,
``
But
I
thought
you
were
friendly
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
I
am
;
that
is
why
we
are
here
.
But
I
have
had
a
strong
disposition
*NL*
to
be
otherwise
.
I
have
said
to
myself
,
`
If
there
is
a
likelihood
of
*NL*
that
youngster
doing
himself
harm
,
why
should
you
interfere
?
Are
n't
*NL*
you
worth
as
much
as
he
is
,
and
do
n't
your
sixteen
years
over
and
above
*NL*
his
,
in
which
you
have
gone
rather
hungry
,
give
you
more
right
to
*NL*
satisfaction
than
he
has
?
If
there
's
a
chance
of
his
going
to
the
*NL*
dogs
,
let
him
--
perhaps
you
could
nohow
hinder
it
--
and
do
you
take
the
*NL*
benefit
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
pause
,
in
which
Fred
was
seized
by
a
most
uncomfortable
*NL*
chill
.
What
was
coming
next
?
He
dreaded
to
hear
that
something
had
*NL*
been
said
to
Mary
--
he
felt
as
if
he
were
listening
to
a
threat
rather
*NL*
than
a
warning
.
When
the
Vicar
began
again
there
was
a
change
in
his
*NL*
tone
like
the
encouraging
transition
to
a
major
key
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
had
once
meant
better
than
that
,
and
I
am
come
back
to
my
old
*NL*
intention
.
I
thought
that
I
could
hardly
_
secure
myself
_
in
it
better
,
*NL*
Fred
,
than
by
telling
you
just
what
had
gone
on
in
me
.
And
now
,
do
you
*NL*
understand
me
?
I
want
you
to
make
the
happiness
of
her
life
and
your
*NL*
own
,
and
if
there
is
any
chance
that
a
word
of
warning
from
me
may
turn
*NL*
aside
any
risk
to
the
contrary
--
well
,
I
have
uttered
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
drop
in
the
Vicar
's
voice
when
he
spoke
the
last
words
.
He
*NL*
paused
--
they
were
standing
on
a
patch
of
green
where
the
road
diverged
*NL*
towards
St.
Botolph
's
,
and
he
put
out
his
hand
,
as
if
to
imply
that
the
*NL*
conversation
was
closed
.
Fred
was
moved
quite
newly
.
Some
one
highly
*NL*
susceptible
to
the
contemplation
of
a
fine
act
has
said
,
that
it
*NL*
produces
a
sort
of
regenerating
shudder
through
the
frame
,
and
makes
*NL*
one
feel
ready
to
begin
a
new
life
.
A
good
degree
of
that
effect
was
*NL*
just
then
present
in
Fred
Vincy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
try
to
be
worthy
,
''
he
said
,
breaking
off
before
he
could
say
*NL*
``
of
you
as
well
as
of
her
.
''
And
meanwhile
Mr.
Farebrother
had
gathered
*NL*
the
impulse
to
say
something
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
not
imagine
that
I
believe
there
is
at
present
any
decline
in
*NL*
her
preference
of
you
,
Fred
.
Set
your
heart
at
rest
,
that
if
you
keep
*NL*
right
,
other
things
will
keep
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
never
forget
what
you
have
done
,
''
Fred
answered
.
``
I
ca
n't
say
*NL*
anything
that
seems
worth
saying
--
only
I
will
try
that
your
goodness
*NL*
shall
not
be
thrown
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
enough
.
Good-by
,
and
God
bless
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
that
way
they
parted
.
But
both
of
them
walked
about
a
long
while
*NL*
before
they
went
out
of
the
starlight
.
Much
of
Fred
's
rumination
might
*NL*
be
summed
up
in
the
words
,
``
It
certainly
would
have
been
a
fine
thing
*NL*
for
her
to
marry
Farebrother
--
but
if
she
loves
me
best
and
I
am
a
good
*NL*
husband
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Perhaps
Mr.
Farebrother
's
might
be
concentrated
into
a
single
shrug

little
speech

``
To
think
of
the
part
one
little
woman
can
play
in

the
life
of
a
man

so
that
to

CHAPTER
LXVII
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
is
there
civil
war
within
the
soul
:
*NL*
Resolve
is
thrust
from
off
the
sacred
throne
*NL*
By
clamorous
Needs
,
and
Pride
the
grand-vizier
*NL*
Makes
humble
compact
,
plays
the
supple
part
*NL*
Of
envoy
and
deft-tongued
apologist
*NL*
For
hungry
rebels
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Happily
Lydgate
had
ended
by
losing
in
the
billiard-room
,
and
brought
*NL*
away
no
encouragement
to
make
a
raid
on
luck
.
On
the
contrary
,
he
felt
*NL*
unmixed
disgust
with
himself
the
next
day
when
he
had
to
pay
four
or
*NL*
five
pounds
over
and
above
his
gains
,
and
he
carried
about
with
him
a
*NL*
most
unpleasant
vision
of
the
figure
he
had
made
,
not
only
rubbing
*NL*
elbows
with
the
men
at
the
Green
Dragon
but
behaving
just
as
they
did
.
*NL*
A
philosopher
fallen
to
betting
is
hardly
distinguishable
from
a
*NL*
Philistine
under
the
same
circumstances
:
the
difference
will
chiefly
be
*NL*
found
in
his
subsequent
reflections
,
and
Lydgate
chewed
a
very
*NL*
disagreeable
cud
in
that
way
.
His
reason
told
him
how
the
affair
might
*NL*
have
been
magnified
into
ruin
by
a
slight
change
of
scenery
--
if
it
had
*NL*
been
a
gambling-house
that
he
had
turned
into
,
where
chance
could
be
*NL*
clutched
with
both
hands
instead
of
being
picked
up
with
thumb
and
*NL*
fore-finger
.
Nevertheless
,
though
reason
strangled
the
desire
to
*NL*
gamble
,
there
remained
the
feeling
that
,
with
an
assurance
of
luck
to
*NL*
the
needful
amount
,
he
would
have
liked
to
gamble
,
rather
than
take
the
*NL*
alternative
which
was
beginning
to
urge
itself
as
inevitable
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
alternative
was
to
apply
to
Mr.
Bulstrode
.
Lydgate
had
so
many
*NL*
times
boasted
both
to
himself
and
others
that
he
was
totally
*NL*
independent
of
Bulstrode
,
to
whose
plans
he
had
lent
himself
solely
*NL*
because
they
enabled
him
to
carry
out
his
own
ideas
of
professional
*NL*
work
and
public
benefit
--
he
had
so
constantly
in
their
personal
*NL*
intercourse
had
his
pride
sustained
by
the
sense
that
he
was
making
a
*NL*
good
social
use
of
this
predominating
banker
,
whose
opinions
he
thought
*NL*
contemptible
and
whose
motives
often
seemed
to
him
an
absurd
mixture
of
*NL*
contradictory
impressions
--
that
he
had
been
creating
for
himself
*NL*
strong
ideal
obstacles
to
the
proffering
of
any
considerable
request
to
*NL*
him
on
his
own
account
.
*NL*
*NL*
Still
,
early
in
March
his
affairs
were
at
that
pass
in
which
men
begin
*NL*
to
say
that
their
oaths
were
delivered
in
ignorance
,
and
to
perceive
*NL*
that
the
act
which
they
had
called
impossible
to
them
is
becoming
*NL*
manifestly
possible
.
With
Dover
's
ugly
security
soon
to
be
put
in
*NL*
force
,
with
the
proceeds
of
his
practice
immediately
absorbed
in
paying
*NL*
back
debts
,
and
with
the
chance
,
if
the
worst
were
known
,
of
daily
*NL*
supplies
being
refused
on
credit
,
above
all
with
the
vision
of
*NL*
Rosamond
's
hopeless
discontent
continually
haunting
him
,
Lydgate
had
*NL*
begun
to
see
that
he
should
inevitably
bend
himself
to
ask
help
from
*NL*
somebody
or
other
.
At
first
he
had
considered
whether
he
should
write
*NL*
to
Mr.
Vincy
;
but
on
questioning
Rosamond
he
found
that
,
as
he
had
*NL*
suspected
,
she
had
already
applied
twice
to
her
father
,
the
last
time
*NL*
being
since
the
disappointment
from
Sir
Godwin
;
and
papa
had
said
that
*NL*
Lydgate
must
look
out
for
himself
.
``
Papa
said
he
had
come
,
with
one
*NL*
bad
year
after
another
,
to
trade
more
and
more
on
borrowed
capital
,
and
*NL*
had
had
to
give
up
many
indulgences
;
he
could
not
spare
a
single
*NL*
hundred
from
the
charges
of
his
family
.
He
said
,
let
Lydgate
ask
*NL*
Bulstrode
:
they
have
always
been
hand
and
glove
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Indeed
,
Lydgate
himself
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
if
he
must
end
*NL*
by
asking
for
a
free
loan
,
his
relations
with
Bulstrode
,
more
at
least
*NL*
than
with
any
other
man
,
might
take
the
shape
of
a
claim
which
was
not
*NL*
purely
personal
.
Bulstrode
had
indirectly
helped
to
cause
the
failure
*NL*
of
his
practice
,
and
had
also
been
highly
gratified
by
getting
a
*NL*
medical
partner
in
his
plans
:
--
but
who
among
us
ever
reduced
himself
*NL*
to
the
sort
of
dependence
in
which
Lydgate
now
stood
,
without
trying
to
*NL*
believe
that
he
had
claims
which
diminished
the
humiliation
of
asking
?
*NL*
It
was
true
that
of
late
there
had
seemed
to
be
a
new
languor
of
*NL*
interest
in
Bulstrode
about
the
Hospital
;
but
his
health
had
got
worse
,
*NL*
and
showed
signs
of
a
deep-seated
nervous
affection
.
In
other
respects
*NL*
he
did
not
appear
to
be
changed
:
he
had
always
been
highly
polite
,
but
*NL*
Lydgate
had
observed
in
him
from
the
first
a
marked
coldness
about
his
*NL*
marriage
and
other
private
circumstances
,
a
coldness
which
he
had
*NL*
hitherto
preferred
to
any
warmth
of
familiarity
between
them
.
He
*NL*
deferred
the
intention
from
day
to
day
,
his
habit
of
acting
on
his
*NL*
conclusions
being
made
infirm
by
his
repugnance
to
every
possible
*NL*
conclusion
and
its
consequent
act
.
He
saw
Mr.
Bulstrode
often
,
but
he
*NL*
did
not
try
to
use
any
occasion
for
his
private
purpose
.
At
one
moment
*NL*
he
thought
,
``
I
will
write
a
letter
:
I
prefer
that
to
any
circuitous
*NL*
talk
;
''
at
another
he
thought
,
``
No
;
if
I
were
talking
to
him
,
I
could
*NL*
make
a
retreat
before
any
signs
of
disinclination
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Still
the
days
passed
and
no
letter
was
written
,
no
special
interview
*NL*
sought
.
In
his
shrinking
from
the
humiliation
of
a
dependent
attitude
*NL*
towards
Bulstrode
,
he
began
to
familiarize
his
imagination
with
another
*NL*
step
even
more
unlike
his
remembered
self
.
He
began
spontaneously
to
*NL*
consider
whether
it
would
be
possible
to
carry
out
that
puerile
notion
*NL*
of
Rosamond
's
which
had
often
made
him
angry
,
namely
,
that
they
should
*NL*
quit
Middlemarch
without
seeing
anything
beyond
that
preface
.
The
*NL*
question
came
--
``
Would
any
man
buy
the
practice
of
me
even
now
,
for
as
*NL*
little
as
it
is
worth
?
Then
the
sale
might
happen
as
a
necessary
*NL*
preparation
for
going
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
against
his
taking
this
step
,
which
he
still
felt
to
be
a
*NL*
contemptible
relinquishment
of
present
work
,
a
guilty
turning
aside
*NL*
from
what
was
a
real
and
might
be
a
widening
channel
for
worthy
*NL*
activity
,
to
start
again
without
any
justified
destination
,
there
was
*NL*
this
obstacle
,
that
the
purchaser
,
if
procurable
at
all
,
might
not
be
*NL*
quickly
forthcoming
.
And
afterwards
?
Rosamond
in
a
poor
lodging
,
*NL*
though
in
the
largest
city
or
most
distant
town
,
would
not
find
the
*NL*
life
that
could
save
her
from
gloom
,
and
save
him
from
the
reproach
of
*NL*
having
plunged
her
into
it
.
For
when
a
man
is
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
*NL*
in
his
fortunes
,
he
may
stay
a
long
while
there
in
spite
of
*NL*
professional
accomplishment
.
In
the
British
climate
there
is
no
*NL*
incompatibility
between
scientific
insight
and
furnished
lodgings
:
the
*NL*
incompatibility
is
chiefly
between
scientific
ambition
and
a
wife
who
*NL*
objects
to
that
kind
of
residence
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
in
the
midst
of
his
hesitation
,
opportunity
came
to
decide
him
.
A
*NL*
note
from
Mr.
Bulstrode
requested
Lydgate
to
call
on
him
at
the
Bank
.
*NL*
A
hypochondriacal
tendency
had
shown
itself
in
the
banker
's
*NL*
constitution
of
late
;
and
a
lack
of
sleep
,
which
was
really
only
a
*NL*
slight
exaggeration
of
an
habitual
dyspeptic
symptom
,
had
been
dwelt
on
*NL*
by
him
as
a
sign
of
threatening
insanity
.
He
wanted
to
consult
Lydgate
*NL*
without
delay
on
that
particular
morning
,
although
he
had
nothing
to
*NL*
tell
beyond
what
he
had
told
before
.
He
listened
eagerly
to
what
*NL*
Lydgate
had
to
say
in
dissipation
of
his
fears
,
though
this
too
was
*NL*
only
repetition
;
and
this
moment
in
which
Bulstrode
was
receiving
a
*NL*
medical
opinion
with
a
sense
of
comfort
,
seemed
to
make
the
*NL*
communication
of
a
personal
need
to
him
easier
than
it
had
been
in
*NL*
Lydgate
's
contemplation
beforehand
.
He
had
been
insisting
that
it
*NL*
would
be
well
for
Mr.
Bulstrode
to
relax
his
attention
to
business
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
sees
how
any
mental
strain
,
however
slight
,
may
affect
a
delicate
*NL*
frame
,
''
said
Lydgate
at
that
stage
of
the
consultation
when
the
remarks
*NL*
tend
to
pass
from
the
personal
to
the
general
,
``
by
the
deep
stamp
which
*NL*
anxiety
will
make
for
a
time
even
on
the
young
and
vigorous
.
I
am
*NL*
naturally
very
strong
;
yet
I
have
been
thoroughly
shaken
lately
by
an
*NL*
accumulation
of
trouble
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
presume
that
a
constitution
in
the
susceptible
state
in
which
mine
*NL*
at
present
is
,
would
be
especially
liable
to
fall
a
victim
to
cholera
,
*NL*
if
it
visited
our
district
.
And
since
its
appearance
near
London
,
we
*NL*
may
well
besiege
the
Mercy-seat
for
our
protection
,
''
said
Mr.
*NL*
Bulstrode
,
not
intending
to
evade
Lydgate
's
allusion
,
but
really
*NL*
preoccupied
with
alarms
about
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
at
all
events
taken
your
share
in
using
good
practical
*NL*
precautions
for
the
town
,
and
that
is
the
best
mode
of
asking
for
*NL*
protection
,
''
said
Lydgate
,
with
a
strong
distaste
for
the
broken
*NL*
metaphor
and
bad
logic
of
the
banker
's
religion
,
somewhat
increased
by
*NL*
the
apparent
deafness
of
his
sympathy
.
But
his
mind
had
taken
up
its
*NL*
long-prepared
movement
towards
getting
help
,
and
was
not
yet
arrested
.
*NL*
He
added
,
``
The
town
has
done
well
in
the
way
of
cleansing
,
and
finding
*NL*
appliances
;
and
I
think
that
if
the
cholera
should
come
,
even
our
*NL*
enemies
will
admit
that
the
arrangements
in
the
Hospital
are
a
public
*NL*
good
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Truly
,
''
said
Mr.
Bulstrode
,
with
some
coldness
.
``
With
regard
to
what
*NL*
you
say
,
Mr.
Lydgate
,
about
the
relaxation
of
my
mental
labor
,
I
have
*NL*
for
some
time
been
entertaining
a
purpose
to
that
effect
--
a
purpose
of
*NL*
a
very
decided
character
.
I
contemplate
at
least
a
temporary
*NL*
withdrawal
from
the
management
of
much
business
,
whether
benevolent
or
*NL*
commercial
.
Also
I
think
of
changing
my
residence
for
a
time
:
probably
*NL*
I
shall
close
or
let
`
The
Shrubs
,
'
and
take
some
place
near
the
*NL*
coast
--
under
advice
of
course
as
to
salubrity
.
That
would
be
a
measure
*NL*
which
you
would
recommend
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
,
''
said
Lydgate
,
falling
backward
in
his
chair
,
with
*NL*
ill-repressed
impatience
under
the
banker
's
pale
earnest
eyes
and
*NL*
intense
preoccupation
with
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
for
some
time
felt
that
I
should
open
this
subject
with
you
in
*NL*
relation
to
our
Hospital
,
''
continued
Bulstrode
.
``
Under
the
*NL*
circumstances
I
have
indicated
,
of
course
I
must
cease
to
have
any
*NL*
personal
share
in
the
management
,
and
it
is
contrary
to
my
views
of
*NL*
responsibility
to
continue
a
large
application
of
means
to
an
*NL*
institution
which
I
can
not
watch
over
and
to
some
extent
regulate
.
I
*NL*
shall
therefore
,
in
case
of
my
ultimate
decision
to
leave
Middlemarch
,
*NL*
consider
that
I
withdraw
other
support
to
the
New
Hospital
than
that
*NL*
which
will
subsist
in
the
fact
that
I
chiefly
supplied
the
expenses
of
*NL*
building
it
,
and
have
contributed
further
large
sums
to
its
successful
*NL*
working
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lydgate
's
thought
,
when
Bulstrode
paused
according
to
his
wont
,
was
,
*NL*
``
He
has
perhaps
been
losing
a
good
deal
of
money
.
''
This
was
the
most
*NL*
plausible
explanation
of
a
speech
which
had
caused
rather
a
startling
*NL*
change
in
his
expectations
.
He
said
in
reply
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
loss
to
the
Hospital
can
hardly
be
made
up
,
I
fear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hardly
,
''
returned
Bulstrode
,
in
the
same
deliberate
,
silvery
tone
;
*NL*
``
except
by
some
changes
of
plan
.
The
only
person
who
may
be
certainly
*NL*
counted
on
as
willing
to
increase
her
contributions
is
Mrs.
Casaubon
.
*NL*
I
have
had
an
interview
with
her
on
the
subject
,
and
I
have
pointed
out
*NL*
to
her
,
as
I
am
about
to
do
to
you
,
that
it
will
be
desirable
to
win
a
*NL*
more
general
support
to
the
New
Hospital
by
a
change
of
system
.
''
*NL*
Another
pause
,
but
Lydgate
did
not
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
change
I
mean
is
an
amalgamation
with
the
Infirmary
,
so
that
the
*NL*
New
Hospital
shall
be
regarded
as
a
special
addition
to
the
elder
*NL*
institution
,
having
the
same
directing
board
.
It
will
be
necessary
,
*NL*
also
,
that
the
medical
management
of
the
two
shall
be
combined
.
In
*NL*
this
way
any
difficulty
as
to
the
adequate
maintenance
of
our
new
*NL*
establishment
will
be
removed
;
the
benevolent
interests
of
the
town
*NL*
will
cease
to
be
divided
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bulstrode
had
lowered
his
eyes
from
Lydgate
's
face
to
the
buttons
*NL*
of
his
coat
as
he
again
paused
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
doubt
that
is
a
good
device
as
to
ways
and
means
,
''
said
Lydgate
,
*NL*
with
an
edge
of
irony
in
his
tone
.
``
But
I
ca
n't
be
expected
to
rejoice
*NL*
in
it
at
once
,
since
one
of
the
first
results
will
be
that
the

*NL*
medical
men
will
upset
or
interrupt
my
methods
,
if
it
were
only
because
*NL*
they
are
mine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
myself
,
as
you
know
,
Mr.
Lydgate
,
highly
valued
the
opportunity
of
*NL*
new
and
independent
procedure
which
you
have
diligently
employed
:
the
*NL*
original
plan
,
I
confess
,
was
one
which
I
had
much
at
heart
,
under
*NL*
submission
to
the
Divine
Will
.
But
since
providential
indications
*NL*
demand
a
renunciation
from
me
,
I
renounce
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bulstrode
showed
a
rather
exasperating
ability
in
this
conversation
.
*NL*
The
broken
metaphor
and
bad
logic
of
motive
which
had
stirred
his
*NL*
hearer
's
contempt
were
quite
consistent
with
a
mode
of
putting
the
*NL*
facts
which
made
it
difficult
for
Lydgate
to
vent
his
own
indignation
*NL*
and
disappointment
.
After
some
rapid
reflection
,
he
only
asked
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
did
Mrs.
Casaubon
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
was
the
further
statement
which
I
wished
to
make
to
you
,
''
said
*NL*
Bulstrode
,
who
had
thoroughly
prepared
his
ministerial
explanation
.
*NL*
``
She
is
,
you
are
aware
,
a
woman
of
most
munificent
disposition
,
and
*NL*
happily
in
possession
--
not
I
presume
of
great
wealth
,
but
of
funds
*NL*
which
she
can
well
spare
.
She
has
informed
me
that
though
she
has
*NL*
destined
the
chief
part
of
those
funds
to
another
purpose
,
she
is
*NL*
willing
to
consider
whether
she
can
not
fully
take
my
place
in
relation
*NL*
to
the
Hospital
.
But
she
wishes
for
ample
time
to
mature
her
thoughts
*NL*
on
the
subject
,
and
I
have
told
her
that
there
is
no
need
for
*NL*
haste
--
that
,
in
fact
,
my
own
plans
are
not
yet
absolute
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lydgate
was
ready
to
say
,
``
If
Mrs.
Casaubon
would
take
your
place
,
*NL*
there
would
be
gain
,
instead
of
loss
.
''
But
there
was
still
a
weight
on
*NL*
his
mind
which
arrested
this
cheerful
candor
.
He
replied
,
``
I
suppose
,
*NL*
then
,
that
I
may
enter
into
the
subject
with
Mrs.
Casaubon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Precisely
;
that
is
what
she
expressly
desires
.
Her
decision
,
she
*NL*
says
,
will
much
depend
on
what
you
can
tell
her
.
But
not
at
present
:
*NL*
she
is
,
I
believe
,
just
setting
out
on
a
journey
.
I
have
her
letter
*NL*
here
,
''
said
Mr.
Bulstrode
,
drawing
it
out
,
and
reading
from
it
.
''
'
I
am
*NL*
immediately
otherwise
engaged
,
'
she
says
.
'
I
am
going
into
Yorkshire
*NL*
with
Sir
James
and
Lady
Chettam
;
and
the
conclusions
I
come
to
about
*NL*
some
land
which
I
am
to
see
there
may
affect
my
power
of
contributing
*NL*
to
the
Hospital
.
'
Thus
,
Mr.
Lydgate
,
there
is
no
haste
necessary
in
*NL*
this
matter
;
but
I
wished
to
apprise
you
beforehand
of
what
may
*NL*
possibly
occur
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bulstrode
returned
the
letter
to
his
side-pocket
,
and
changed
his
*NL*
attitude
as
if
his
business
were
closed
.
Lydgate
,
whose
renewed
hope
*NL*
about
the
Hospital
only
made
him
more
conscious
of
the
facts
which
*NL*
poisoned
his
hope
,
felt
that
his
effort
after
help
,
if
made
at
all
,
*NL*
must
be
made
now
and
vigorously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
much
obliged
to
you
for
giving
me
full
notice
,
''
he
said
,
with
a
*NL*
firm
intention
in
his
tone
,
yet
with
an
interruptedness
in
his
delivery
*NL*
which
showed
that
he
spoke
unwillingly
.
``
The
highest
object
to
me
is
*NL*
my
profession
,
and
I
had
identified
the
Hospital
with
the
best
use
I
*NL*
can
at
present
make
of
my
profession
.
But
the
best
use
is
not
always
*NL*
the
same
with
monetary
success
.
Everything
which
has
made
the
Hospital
*NL*
unpopular
has
helped
with
other
causes
--
I
think
they
are
all
connected
*NL*
with
my
professional
zeal
--
to
make
me
unpopular
as
a
practitioner
.
I
*NL*
get
chiefly
patients
who
ca
n't
pay
me
.
I
should
like
them
best
,
if
I
*NL*
had
nobody
to
pay
on
my
own
side
.
''
Lydgate
waited
a
little
,
but
*NL*
Bulstrode
only
bowed
,
looking
at
him
fixedly
,
and
he
went
on
with
the
*NL*
same
interrupted
enunciation
--
as
if
he
were
biting
an
objectional
leek
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
slipped
into
money
difficulties
which
I
can
see
no
way
out
of
,
*NL*
unless
some
one
who
trusts
me
and
my
future
will
advance
me
a
sum
*NL*
without
other
security
.
I
had
very
little
fortune
left
when
I
came
*NL*
here
.
I
have
no
prospects
of
money
from
my
own
family
.
My
expenses
,
*NL*
in
consequence
of
my
marriage
,
have
been
very
much
greater
than
I
had
*NL*
expected
.
The
result
at
this
moment
is
that
it
would
take
a
thousand
*NL*
pounds
to
clear
me
.
I
mean
,
to
free
me
from
the
risk
of
having
all
my
*NL*
goods
sold
in
security
of
my
largest
debt
--
as
well
as
to
pay
my
other
*NL*
debts
--
and
leave
anything
to
keep
us
a
little
beforehand
with
our
small
*NL*
income
.
I
find
that
it
is
out
of
the
question
that
my
wife
's
father
*NL*
should
make
such
an
advance
.
That
is
why
I
mention
my
position
to
--
to
*NL*
the
only
other
man
who
may
be
held
to
have
some
personal
connection
*NL*
with
my
prosperity
or
ruin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lydgate
hated
to
hear
himself
.
But
he
had
spoken
now
,
and
had
spoken
*NL*
with
unmistakable
directness
.
Mr.
Bulstrode
replied
without
haste
,
but
*NL*
also
without
hesitation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
grieved
,
though
,
I
confess
,
not
surprised
by
this
information
,
*NL*
Mr.
Lydgate
.
For
my
own
part
,
I
regretted
your
alliance
with
my
*NL*
brother-in-law
's
family
,
which
has
always
been
of
prodigal
habits
,
and
*NL*
which
has
already
been
much
indebted
to
me
for
sustainment
in
its
*NL*
present
position
.
My
advice
to
you
,
Mr.
Lydgate
,
would
be
,
that
*NL*
instead
of
involving
yourself
in
further
obligations
,
and
continuing
a
*NL*
doubtful
struggle
,
you
should
simply
become
a
bankrupt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
would
not
improve
my
prospect
,
''
said
Lydgate
,
rising
and
speaking
*NL*
bitterly
,
``
even
if
it
were
a
more
agreeable
thing
in
itself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
always
a
trial

''
said
Mr.
Bulstrode
;
``
but
trial
,
my
dear
sir
,
is
*NL*
our
portion
here

and
is
a
needed
corrective

I
recommend
you
to
weigh
*NL*
the
advice
I
have
given
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you

said
Lydgate

not
quite
knowing

*NL*
That
change
of
plan
and
shifting
of
interest
which
Bulstrode
stated
or
*NL*
betrayed
in
his
conversation
with
Lydgate
,
had
been
determined
in
him
*NL*
by
some
severe
experience
which
he
had
gone
through
since
the
epoch
of
*NL*
Mr.
Larcher
's
sale
,
when
Raffles
had
recognized
Will
Ladislaw
,
and
when
*NL*
the
banker
had
in
vain
attempted
an
act
of
restitution
which
might
move
*NL*
Divine
Providence
to
arrest
painful
consequences
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
certainty
that
Raffles
,
unless
he
were
dead
,
would
return
to
*NL*
Middlemarch
before
long
,
had
been
justified
.
On
Christmas
Eve
he
had
*NL*
reappeared
at
The
Shrubs
.
Bulstrode
was
at
home
to
receive
him
,
and
*NL*
hinder
his
communication
with
the
rest
of
the
family
,
but
he
could
not
*NL*
altogether
hinder
the
circumstances
of
the
visit
from
compromising
*NL*
himself
and
alarming
his
wife
.
Raffles
proved
more
unmanageable
than
*NL*
he
had
shown
himself
to
be
in
his
former
appearances
,
his
chronic
state
*NL*
of
mental
restlessness
,
the
growing
effect
of
habitual
intemperance
,
*NL*
quickly
shaking
off
every
impression
from
what
was
said
to
him
.
He
*NL*
insisted
on
staying
in
the
house
,
and
Bulstrode
,
weighing
two
sets
of
*NL*
evils
,
felt
that
this
was
at
least
not
a
worse
alternative
than
his
*NL*
going
into
the
town
.
He
kept
him
in
his
own
room
for
the
evening
and
*NL*
saw
him
to
bed
,
Raffles
all
the
while
amusing
himself
with
the
*NL*
annoyance
he
was
causing
this
decent
and
highly
prosperous
*NL*
fellow-sinner
,
an
amusement
which
he
facetiously
expressed
as
sympathy
*NL*
with
his
friend
's
pleasure
in
entertaining
a
man
who
had
been
*NL*
serviceable
to
him
,
and
who
had
not
had
all
his
earnings
.
There
was
a
*NL*
cunning
calculation
under
this
noisy
joking
--
a
cool
resolve
to
extract
*NL*
something
the
handsomer
from
Bulstrode
as
payment
for
release
from
this
*NL*
new
application
of
torture
.
But
his
cunning
had
a
little
overcast
its
*NL*
mark
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bulstrode
was
indeed
more
tortured
than
the
coarse
fibre
of
Raffles
*NL*
could
enable
him
to
imagine
.
He
had
told
his
wife
that
he
was
simply
*NL*
taking
care
of
this
wretched
creature
,
the
victim
of
vice
,
who
might
*NL*
otherwise
injure
himself
;
he
implied
,
without
the
direct
form
of
*NL*
falsehood
,
that
there
was
a
family
tie
which
bound
him
to
this
care
,
*NL*
and
that
there
were
signs
of
mental
alienation
in
Raffles
which
urged
*NL*
caution
.
He
would
himself
drive
the
unfortunate
being
away
the
next
*NL*
morning
.
In
these
hints
he
felt
that
he
was
supplying
Mrs.
Bulstrode
*NL*
with
precautionary
information
for
his
daughters
and
servants
,
and
*NL*
accounting
for
his
allowing
no
one
but
himself
to
enter
the
room
even
*NL*
with
food
and
drink
.
But
he
sat
in
an
agony
of
fear
lest
Raffles
*NL*
should
be
overheard
in
his
loud
and
plain
references
to
past
facts
--
lest
*NL*
Mrs.
Bulstrode
should
be
even
tempted
to
listen
at
the
door
.
How
*NL*
could
he
hinder
her
,
how
betray
his
terror
by
opening
the
door
to
*NL*
detect
her
?
She
was
a
woman
of
honest
direct
habits
,
and
little
likely
*NL*
to
take
so
low
a
course
in
order
to
arrive
at
painful
knowledge
;
but
*NL*
fear
was
stronger
than
the
calculation
of
probabilities
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
way
Raffles
had
pushed
the
torture
too
far
,
and
produced
an
*NL*
effect
which
had
not
been
in
his
plan
.
By
showing
himself
hopelessly
*NL*
unmanageable
he
had
made
Bulstrode
feel
that
a
strong
defiance
was
the
*NL*
only
resource
left
.
After
taking
Raffles
to
bed
that
night
the
banker
*NL*
ordered
his
closed
carriage
to
be
ready
at
half-past
seven
the
next
*NL*
morning
.
At
six
o'clock
he
had
already
been
long
dressed
,
and
had
*NL*
spent
some
of
his
wretchedness
in
prayer
,
pleading
his
motives
for
*NL*
averting
the
worst
evil
if
in
anything
he
had
used
falsity
and
spoken
*NL*
what
was
not
true
before
God
.
For
Bulstrode
shrank
from
a
direct
lie
*NL*
with
an
intensity
disproportionate
to
the
number
of
his
more
indirect
*NL*
misdeeds
.
But
many
of
these
misdeeds
were
like
the
subtle
muscular
*NL*
movements
which
are
not
taken
account
of
in
the
consciousness
,
though
*NL*
they
bring
about
the
end
that
we
fix
our
mind
on
and
desire
.
And
it
is
*NL*
only
what
we
are
vividly
conscious
of
that
we
can
vividly
imagine
to
be
*NL*
seen
by
Omniscience
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bulstrode
carried
his
candle
to
the
bedside
of
Raffles
,
who
was
*NL*
apparently
in
a
painful
dream
.
He
stood
silent
,
hoping
that
the
*NL*
presence
of
the
light
would
serve
to
waken
the
sleeper
gradually
and
*NL*
gently
,
for
he
feared
some
noise
as
the
consequence
of
a
too
sudden
*NL*
awakening
.
He
had
watched
for
a
couple
of
minutes
or
more
the
*NL*
shudderings
and
pantings
which
seemed
likely
to
end
in
waking
,
when
*NL*
Raffles
,
with
a
long
half-stifled
moan
,
started
up
and
stared
round
him
*NL*
in
terror
,
trembling
and
gasping
.
But
he
made
no
further
noise
,
and
*NL*
Bulstrode
,
setting
down
the
candle
,
awaited
his
recovery
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
before
Bulstrode
,
with
a
cold
*NL*
peremptoriness
of
manner
which
he
had
not
before
shown
,
said
,
``
I
came
*NL*
to
call
you
thus
early
,
Mr.
Raffles
,
because
I
have
ordered
the
*NL*
carriage
to
be
ready
at
half-past
seven
,
and
intend
myself
to
conduct
*NL*
you
as
far
as
Ilsely
,
where
you
can
either
take
the
railway
or
await
a
*NL*
coach
.
''
Raffles
was
about
to
speak
,
but
Bulstrode
anticipated
him
*NL*
imperiously
with
the
words
,
``
Be
silent
,
sir
,
and
hear
what
I
have
to
*NL*
say
.
I
shall
supply
you
with
money
now
,
and
I
will
furnish
you
with
a
*NL*
reasonable
sum
from
time
to
time
,
on
your
application
to
me
by
letter
;
*NL*
but
if
you
choose
to
present
yourself
here
again
,
if
you
return
to
*NL*
Middlemarch
,
if
you
use
your
tongue
in
a
manner
injurious
to
me
,
you
*NL*
will
have
to
live
on
such
fruits
as
your
malice
can
bring
you
,
without
*NL*
help
from
me
.
Nobody
will
pay
you
well
for
blasting
my
name
:
I
know
*NL*
the
worst
you
can
do
against
me
,
and
I
shall
brave
it
if
you
dare
to
*NL*
thrust
yourself
upon
me
again
.
Get
up
,
sir
,
and
do
as
I
order

without
noise
,
or
I
will
send
for
a
policeman
to
take
you
off
my
*NL*
premises
,
and
you
may
carry
your
stories
into
every
pothouse
in
the
*NL*
town
,
but
you
shall
have
no
sixpence
from
me
to
pay
your
expenses
*NL*
there

''
*NL*
*NL*
Bulstrode
had
rarely
in
his
life
spoken
with
such
nervous
energy
:
he
*NL*
had
been
deliberating
on
this
speech
and
its
probable
effects
through
a
*NL*
large
part
of
the
night
;
and
though
he
did
not
trust
to
its
ultimately
*NL*
saving
him
from
any
return
of
Raffles
,
he
had
concluded
that
it
was
the
*NL*
best
throw
he
could
make
.
It
succeeded
in
enforcing
submission
from
*NL*
the
jaded
man
this
morning
:
his
empoisoned
system
at
this
moment
*NL*
quailed
before
Bulstrode
's
cold
,
resolute
bearing
,
and
he
was
taken
off
*NL*
quietly
in
the
carriage
before
the
family
breakfast
time
.
The
servants
*NL*
imagined
him
to
be
a
poor
relation
,
and
were
not
surprised
that
a
*NL*
strict
man
like
their
master
,
who
held
his
head
high
in
the
world
,
*NL*
should
be
ashamed
of
such
a
cousin
and
want
to
get
rid
of
him
.
The
*NL*
banker
's
drive
of
ten
miles
with
his
hated
companion
was
a
dreary
*NL*
beginning
of
the
Christmas
day
;
but
at
the
end
of
the
drive
,
Raffles
*NL*
had
recovered
his
spirits
,
and
parted
in
a
contentment
for
which
there
*NL*
was
the
good
reason
that
the
banker
had
given
him
a
hundred
pounds
.
*NL*
Various
motives
urged
Bulstrode
to
this
open-handedness
,
but
he
did
not
*NL*
himself
inquire
closely
into
all
of
them
.
As
he
had
stood
watching
*NL*
Raffles
in
his
uneasy
sleep
,
it
had
certainly
entered
his
mind
that
the
*NL*
man
had
been
much
shattered
since
the
first
gift
of
two
hundred
pounds
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
taken
care
to
repeat
the
incisive
statement
of
his
resolve
not
*NL*
to
be
played
on
any
more
;
and
had
tried
to
penetrate
Raffles
with
the
*NL*
fact
that
he
had
shown
the
risks
of
bribing
him
to
be
quite
equal
to
*NL*
the
risks
of
defying
him
.
But
when
,
freed
from
his
repulsive
presence
,
*NL*
Bulstrode
returned
to
his
quiet
home
,
he
brought
with
him
no
confidence
*NL*
that
he
had
secured
more
than
a
respite
.
It
was
as
if
he
had
had
a
*NL*
loathsome
dream
,
and
could
not
shake
off
its
images
with
their
hateful
*NL*
kindred
of
sensations
--
as
if
on
all
the
pleasant
surroundings
of
his
*NL*
life
a
dangerous
reptile
had
left
his
slimy
traces
.
*NL*
*NL*
Who
can
know
how
much
of
his
most
inward
life
is
made
up
of
the
*NL*
thoughts
he
believes
other
men
to
have
about
him
,
until
that
fabric
of
*NL*
opinion
is
threatened
with
ruin
?
*NL*
*NL*
Bulstrode
was
only
the
more
conscious
that
there
was
a
deposit
of
*NL*
uneasy
presentiment
in
his
wife
's
mind
,
because
she
carefully
avoided
*NL*
any
allusion
to
it
.
He
had
been
used
every
day
to
taste
the
flavor
of
*NL*
supremacy
and
the
tribute
of
complete
deference
:
and
the
certainty
that
*NL*
he
was
watched
or
measured
with
a
hidden
suspicion
of
his
having
some
*NL*
discreditable
secret
,
made
his
voice
totter
when
he
was
speaking
to
*NL*
edification
.
Foreseeing
,
to
men
of
Bulstrode
's
anxious
temperament
,
is
*NL*
often
worse
than
seeing
;
and
his
imagination
continually
heightened
the
*NL*
anguish
of
an
imminent
disgrace
.
Yes
,
imminent
;
for
if
his
defiance
of
*NL*
Raffles
did
not
keep
the
man
away
--
and
though
he
prayed
for
this
result
*NL*
he
hardly
hoped
for
it
--
the
disgrace
was
certain
.
In
vain
he
said
to
*NL*
himself
that
,
if
permitted
,
it
would
be
a
divine
visitation
,
a
*NL*
chastisement
,
a
preparation
;
he
recoiled
from
the
imagined
burning
;
and
*NL*
he
judged
that
it
must
be
more
for
the
Divine
glory
that
he
should
*NL*
escape
dishonor
.
That
recoil
had
at
last
urged
him
to
make
*NL*
preparations
for
quitting
Middlemarch
.
If
evil
truth
must
be
reported
*NL*
of
him
,
he
would
then
be
at
a
less
scorching
distance
from
the
contempt
*NL*
of
his
old
neighbors
;
and
in
a
new
scene
,
where
his
life
would
not
have
*NL*
gathered
the
same
wide
sensibility
,
the
tormentor
,
if
he
pursued
him
,
*NL*
would
be
less
formidable
.
To
leave
the
place
finally
would
,
he
knew
,
*NL*
be
extremely
painful
to
his
wife
,
and
on
other
grounds
he
would
have
*NL*
preferred
to
stay
where
he
had
struck
root
.
Hence
he
made
his
*NL*
preparations
at
first
in
a
conditional
way
,
wishing
to
leave
on
all
*NL*
sides
an
opening
for
his
return
after
brief
absence
,
if
any
favorable
*NL*
intervention
of
Providence
should
dissipate
his
fears
.
He
was
*NL*
preparing
to
transfer
his
management
of
the
Bank
,
and
to
give
up
any
*NL*
active
control
of
other
commercial
affairs
in
the
neighborhood
,
on
the
*NL*
ground
of
his
failing
health
,
but
without
excluding
his
future
*NL*
resumption
of
such
work
.
The
measure
would
cause
him
some
added
*NL*
expense
and
some
diminution
of
income
beyond
what
he
had
already
*NL*
undergone
from
the
general
depression
of
trade
;
and
the
Hospital
*NL*
presented
itself
as
a
principal
object
of
outlay
on
which
he
could
*NL*
fairly
economize
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
experience
which
had
determined
his
conversation
with
*NL*
Lydgate
.
But
at
this
time
his
arrangements
had
most
of
them
gone
no
*NL*
farther
than
a
stage
at
which
he
could
recall
them
if
they
proved
to
be
*NL*
unnecessary
.
He
continually
deferred
the
final
steps
;
in
the
midst
of
*NL*
his
fears
,
like
many
a
man
who
is
in
danger
of
shipwreck
or
of
being
*NL*
dashed
from
his
carriage
by
runaway
horses
,
he
had
a
clinging
*NL*
impression
that
something
would
happen
to
hinder
the
worst
,
and
that
to
*NL*
spoil
his
life
by
a
late
transplantation
might
be
over-hasty
--
especially
*NL*
since
it
was
difficult
to
account
satisfactorily
to
his
wife
for
the
*NL*
project
of
their
indefinite
exile
from
the
only
place
where
she
would
*NL*
like
to
live
.
*NL*
*NL*
Among
the
affairs
Bulstrode
had
to
care
for
,
was
the
management
of
the
*NL*
farm
at
Stone
Court
in
case
of
his
absence
;
and
on
this
as
well
as
on
*NL*
all
other
matters
connected
with
any
houses
and
land
he
possessed
in
or
*NL*
about
Middlemarch
,
he
had
consulted
Caleb
Garth
.
Like
every
one
else
*NL*
who
had
business
of
that
sort
,
he
wanted
to
get
the
agent
who
was
more
*NL*
anxious
for
his
employer
's
interests
than
his
own
.
With
regard
to
*NL*
Stone
Court
,
since
Bulstrode
wished
to
retain
his
hold
on
the
stock
,
*NL*
and
to
have
an
arrangement
by
which
he
himself
could
,
if
he
chose
,
*NL*
resume
his
favorite
recreation
of
superintendence
,
Caleb
had
advised
*NL*
him
not
to
trust
to
a
mere
bailiff
,
but
to
let
the
land
,
stock
,
and
*NL*
implements
yearly
,
and
take
a
proportionate
share
of
the
proceeds
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
I
trust
to
you
to
find
me
a
tenant
on
these
terms
,
Mr.
Garth
?
''
*NL*
said
Bulstrode
.
``
And
will
you
mention
to
me
the
yearly
sum
which
would
*NL*
repay
you
for
managing
these
affairs
which
we
have
discussed
together
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
think
about
it
,
''
said
Caleb
,
in
his
blunt
way
.
``
I
'll
see
how
I
*NL*
can
make
it
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
If
it
had
not
been
that
he
had
to
consider
Fred
Vincy
's
future
,
Mr.
*NL*
Garth
would
not
probably
have
been
glad
of
any
addition
to
his
work
,
of
*NL*
which
his
wife
was
always
fearing
an
excess
for
him
as
he
grew
older
.
*NL*
But
on
quitting
Bulstrode
after
that
conversation
,
a
very
alluring
idea
*NL*
occurred
to
him
about
this
said
letting
of
Stone
Court
.
What
if
*NL*
Bulstrode
would
agree
to
his
placing
Fred
Vincy
there
on
the
*NL*
understanding
that
he
,
Caleb
Garth
,
should
be
responsible
for
the
*NL*
management
?
It
would
be
an
excellent
schooling
for
Fred
;
he
might
make
*NL*
a
modest
income
there
,
and
still
have
time
left
to
get
knowledge
by
*NL*
helping
in
other
business
.
He
mentioned
his
notion
to
Mrs.
Garth
with
*NL*
such
evident
delight
that
she
could
not
bear
to
chill
his
pleasure
by
*NL*
expressing
her
constant
fear
of
his
undertaking
too
much
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
lad
would
be
as
happy
as
two
,
''
he
said
,
throwing
himself
back
in
*NL*
his
chair
,
and
looking
radiant
,
``
if
I
could
tell
him
it
was
all
*NL*
settled
.
Think
;
Susan
!
His
mind
had
been
running
on
that
place
for
*NL*
years
before
old
Featherstone
died
.
And
it
would
be
as
pretty
a
turn
*NL*
of
things
as
could
be
that
he
should
hold
the
place
in
a
good
*NL*
industrious
way
after
all
--
by
his
taking
to
business
.
For
it
's
likely
*NL*
enough
Bulstrode
might
let
him
go
on
,
and
gradually
buy
the
stock
.
He
*NL*
has
n't
made
up
his
mind
,
I
can
see
,
whether
or
not
he
shall
settle
*NL*
somewhere
else
as
a
lasting
thing
.
I
never
was
better
pleased
with
a
*NL*
notion
in
my
life
.
And
then
the
children
might
be
married
by-and-by
,
*NL*
Susan
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
not
give
any
hint
of
the
plan
to
Fred
,
until
you
are
sure
*NL*
that
Bulstrode
would
agree
to
the
plan
?
''
said
Mrs.
Garth
,
in
a
tone
of
*NL*
gentle
caution
.
``
And
as
to
marriage
,
Caleb
,
we
old
people
need
not
*NL*
help
to
hasten
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
do
n't
know
,
''
said
Caleb
,
swinging
his
head
aside
.
``
Marriage
is
*NL*
a
taming
thing
.
Fred
would
want
less
of
my
bit
and
bridle
.
However
,
I
*NL*
shall
say
nothing
till
I
know
the
ground
I
'm
treading
on
.
I
shall
*NL*
speak
to
Bulstrode
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
his
earliest
opportunity
of
doing
so
.
Bulstrode
had
anything
*NL*
but
a
warm
interest
in
his
nephew
Fred
Vincy
,
but
he
had
a
strong
wish
*NL*
to
secure
Mr.
Garth
's
services
on
many
scattered
points
of
business
at
*NL*
which
he
was
sure
to
be
a
considerable
loser
,
if
they
were
under
less
*NL*
conscientious
management
.
On
that
ground
he
made
no
objection
to
Mr.
*NL*
Garth
's
proposal
;
and
there
was
also
another
reason
why
he
was
not
*NL*
sorry
to
give
a
consent
which
was
to
benefit
one
of
the
Vincy
family
.
*NL*
It
was
that
Mrs.
Bulstrode
,
having
heard
of
Lydgate
's
debts
,
had
been
*NL*
anxious
to
know
whether
her
husband
could
not
do
something
for
poor
*NL*
Rosamond
,
and
had
been
much
troubled
on
learning
from
him
that
*NL*
Lydgate
's
affairs
were
not
easily
remediable
,
and
that
the
wisest
plan
*NL*
was
to
let
them
``
take
their
course
.
''
Mrs.
Bulstrode
had
then
said
for
*NL*
the
first
time
,
``
I
think
you
are
always
a
little
hard
towards
my
*NL*
family
,
Nicholas
.
And
I
am
sure
I
have
no
reason
to
deny
any
of
my
*NL*
relatives
.
Too
worldly
they
may
be
,
but
no
one
ever
had
to
say
that
*NL*
they
were
not
respectable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Harriet
,
''
said
Mr.
Bulstrode
,
wincing
under
his
wife
's
eyes
,
*NL*
which
were
filling
with
tears
,
``
I
have
supplied
your
brother
with
a
*NL*
great
deal
of
capital
.
I
can
not
be
expected
to
take
care
of
his
*NL*
married
children
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
seemed
to
be
true
,
and
Mrs.
Bulstrode
's
remonstrance
subsided
into
*NL*
pity
for
poor
Rosamond
,
whose
extravagant
education
she
had
always
*NL*
foreseen
the
fruits
of
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
remembering
that
dialogue
,
Mr.
Bulstrode
felt
that
when
he
had
to
*NL*
talk
to
his
wife
fully
about
his
plan
of
quitting
Middlemarch
,
he
*NL*
should
be
glad
to
tell
her
that
he
had
made
an
arrangement
which
might
*NL*
be
for
the
good
of
her
nephew
Fred
.
At
present
he
had
merely
mentioned
*NL*
to
her
that
he
thought
of
shutting
up
The
Shrubs
for
a
few
months
,
and
*NL*
taking
a
house
on
the
Southern
Coast
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hence
Mr.
Garth
got
the
assurance
he
desired
,
namely
,
that
in
case
of
*NL*
Bulstrode
's
departure
from
Middlemarch
for
an
indefinite
time
,
Fred
*NL*
Vincy
should
be
allowed
to
have
the
tenancy
of
Stone
Court
on
the
terms
*NL*
proposed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Caleb
was
so
elated
with
his
hope
of
this
``
neat
turn
''
being
given
to
*NL*
things
,
that
if
his
self-control
had
not
been
braced
by
a
little
*NL*
affectionate
wifely
scolding
,
he
would
have
betrayed
everything
to
*NL*
Mary
,
wanting
``
to
give
the
child
comfort
.
''
However
,
he
restrained
*NL*
himself
,
and
kept
in
strict
privacy
from
Fred
certain
visits
which
he
*NL*
was
making
to
Stone
Court
,
in
order
to
look
more
thoroughly
into
the
*NL*
state
of
the
land
and
stock
,
and
take
a
preliminary
estimate
.
He
was
*NL*
certainly
more
eager
in
these
visits
than
the
probable
speed
of
events
*NL*
required
him
to
be
;
but
he
was
stimulated
by
a
fatherly
delight
in
*NL*
occupying
his
mind
with
this
bit
of
probable
happiness
which
he
held
in
*NL*
store
like
a
hidden
birthday
gift
for
Fred
and
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
suppose
the
whole
scheme
should
turn
out
to
be
a
castle
in
the
*NL*
air
?
''
said
Mrs.
Garth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
well
,
''
replied
Caleb
;
``
the
castle
will
tumble
about
nobody
's
*NL*
head

Mr.
Bulstrode
was
still
seated
in
his
manager
's
room
at
the
Bank
,
about
*NL*
three
o'clock
of
the
same
day
on
which
he
had
received
Lydgate
there
,
*NL*
when
the
clerk
entered
to
say
that
his
horse
was
waiting
,
and
also
that
*NL*
Mr.
Garth
was
outside
and
begged
to
speak
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
all
means
,
''
said
Bulstrode
;
and
Caleb
entered
.
``
Pray
sit
down
,
Mr.
*NL*
Garth
,
''
continued
the
banker
,
in
his
suavest
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
glad
that
you
arrived
just
in
time
to
find
me
here
.
I
know
you
*NL*
count
your
minutes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
said
Caleb
,
gently
,
with
a
slow
swing
of
his
head
on
one
side
,
as
*NL*
he
seated
himself
and
laid
his
hat
on
the
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
at
the
ground
,
leaning
forward
and
letting
his
long
fingers
*NL*
droop
between
his
legs
,
while
each
finger
moved
in
succession
,
as
if
it
*NL*
were
sharing
some
thought
which
filled
his
large
quiet
brow
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bulstrode
,
like
every
one
else
who
knew
Caleb
,
was
used
to
his
*NL*
slowness
in
beginning
to
speak
on
any
topic
which
he
felt
to
be
*NL*
important
,
and
rather
expected
that
he
was
about
to
recur
to
the
buying
*NL*
of
some
houses
in
Blindman
's
Court
,
for
the
sake
of
pulling
them
down
,
*NL*
as
a
sacrifice
of
property
which
would
be
well
repaid
by
the
influx
of
*NL*
air
and
light
on
that
spot
.
It
was
by
propositions
of
this
kind
that
*NL*
Caleb
was
sometimes
troublesome
to
his
employers
;
but
he
had
usually
*NL*
found
Bulstrode
ready
to
meet
him
in
projects
of
improvement
,
and
they
*NL*
had
got
on
well
together
.
When
he
spoke
again
,
however
,
it
was
to
say
,
*NL*
in
rather
a
subdued
voice
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
just
come
away
from
Stone
Court
,
Mr.
Bulstrode
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
found
nothing
wrong
there
,
I
hope
,
''
said
the
banker
;
``
I
was
there
*NL*
myself
yesterday
.
Abel
has
done
well
with
the
lambs
this
year
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
yes
,
''
said
Caleb
,
looking
up
gravely
,
``
there
is
something
wrong
--
a
*NL*
stranger
,
who
is
very
ill
,
I
think
.
He
wants
a
doctor
,
and
I
came
to
*NL*
tell
you
of
that
.
His
name
is
Raffles
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
saw
the
shock
of
his
words
passing
through
Bulstrode
's
frame
.
On
*NL*
this
subject
the
banker
had
thought
that
his
fears
were
too
constantly
*NL*
on
the
watch
to
be
taken
by
surprise
;
but
he
had
been
mistaken
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
wretch
!
''
he
said
in
a
compassionate
tone
,
though
his
lips
*NL*
trembled
a
little
.
``
Do
you
know
how
he
came
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
took
him
myself
,
''
said
Caleb
,
quietly
--
``
took
him
up
in
my
gig
.
He
*NL*
had
got
down
from
the
coach
,
and
was
walking
a
little
beyond
the
*NL*
turning
from
the
toll-house
,
and
I
overtook
him
.
He
remembered
seeing
*NL*
me
with
you
once
before
,
at
Stone
Court
,
and
he
asked
me
to
take
him
*NL*
on
.
I
saw
he
was
ill
:
it
seemed
to
me
the
right
thing
to
do
,
to
carry
*NL*
him
under
shelter
.
And
now
I
think
you
should
lose
no
time
in
getting
*NL*
advice
for
him
.
''
Caleb
took
up
his
hat
from
the
floor
as
he
ended
,
and
*NL*
rose
slowly
from
his
seat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
,
''
said
Bulstrode
,
whose
mind
was
very
active
at
this
moment
.
*NL*
``
Perhaps
you
will
yourself
oblige
me
,
Mr.
Garth
,
by
calling
at
Mr.
*NL*
Lydgate
's
as
you
pass
--
or
stay
!
he
may
at
this
hour
probably
be
at
the
*NL*
Hospital
.
I
will
first
send
my
man
on
the
horse
there
with
a
note
this
*NL*
instant
,
and
then
I
will
myself
ride
to
Stone
Court
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bulstrode
quickly
wrote
a
note
,
and
went
out
himself
to
give
the
*NL*
commission
to
his
man
.
When
he
returned
,
Caleb
was
standing
as
before
*NL*
with
one
hand
on
the
back
of
the
chair
,
holding
his
hat
with
the
other
.
*NL*
In
Bulstrode
's
mind
the
dominant
thought
was
,
``
Perhaps
Raffles
only
*NL*
spoke
to
Garth
of
his
illness
.
Garth
may
wonder
,
as
he
must
have
done
*NL*
before
,
at
this
disreputable
fellow
's
claiming
intimacy
with
me
;
but
he
*NL*
will
know
nothing
.
And
he
is
friendly
to
me
--
I
can
be
of
use
to
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
longed
for
some
confirmation
of
this
hopeful
conjecture
,
but
to
have
*NL*
asked
any
question
as
to
what
Raffles
had
said
or
done
would
have
been
*NL*
to
betray
fear
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
exceedingly
obliged
to
you
,
Mr.
Garth
,
''
he
said
,
in
his
usual
*NL*
tone
of
politeness
.
``
My
servant
will
be
back
in
a
few
minutes
,
and
I
*NL*
shall
then
go
myself
to
see
what
can
be
done
for
this
unfortunate
man
.
*NL*
Perhaps
you
had
some
other
business
with
me
?
If
so
,
pray
be
seated
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
''
said
Caleb
,
making
a
slight
gesture
with
his
right
hand
to
*NL*
waive
the
invitation
.
``
I
wish
to
say
,
Mr.
Bulstrode
,
that
I
must
*NL*
request
you
to
put
your
business
into
some
other
hands
than
mine
.
I
am
*NL*
obliged
to
you
for
your
handsome
way
of
meeting
me
--
about
the
letting
*NL*
of
Stone
Court
,
and
all
other
business
.
But
I
must
give
it
up
.
''
A
*NL*
sharp
certainty
entered
like
a
stab
into
Bulstrode
's
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
sudden
,
Mr.
Garth
,
''
was
all
he
could
say
at
first
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
,
''
said
Caleb
;
``
but
it
is
quite
fixed
.
I
must
give
it
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
spoke
with
a
firmness
which
was
very
gentle
,
and
yet
he
could
see
*NL*
that
Bulstrode
seemed
to
cower
under
that
gentleness
,
his
face
looking
*NL*
dried
and
his
eyes
swerving
away
from
the
glance
which
rested
on
him
.
*NL*
Caleb
felt
a
deep
pity
for
him
,
but
he
could
have
used
no
pretexts
to
*NL*
account
for
his
resolve
,
even
if
they
would
have
been
of
any
use
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
been
led
to
this
,
I
apprehend
,
by
some
slanders
concerning
me
*NL*
uttered
by
that
unhappy
creature
,
''
said
Bulstrode
,
anxious
now
to
know
*NL*
the
utmost
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
true
.
I
ca
n't
deny
that
I
act
upon
what
I
heard
from
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
a
conscientious
man
,
Mr.
Garth
--
a
man
,
I
trust
,
who
feels
*NL*
himself
accountable
to
God
.
You
would
not
wish
to
injure
me
by
being
*NL*
too
ready
to
believe
a
slander
,
''
said
Bulstrode
,
casting
about
for
*NL*
pleas
that
might
be
adapted
to
his
hearer
's
mind
.
``
That
is
a
poor
*NL*
reason
for
giving
up
a
connection
which
I
think
I
may
say
will
be
*NL*
mutually
beneficial
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
injure
no
man
if
I
could
help
it
,
''
said
Caleb
;
``
even
if
I
*NL*
thought
God
winked
at
it
.
I
hope
I
should
have
a
feeling
for
my
*NL*
fellow-creature
.
But
,
sir
--
I
am
obliged
to
believe
that
this
Raffles
*NL*
has
told
me
the
truth
.
And
I
ca
n't
be
happy
in
working
with
you
,
or
*NL*
profiting
by
you
.
It
hurts
my
mind
.
I
must
beg
you
to
seek
another
*NL*
agent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
Mr.
Garth
.
But
I
must
at
least
claim
to
know
the
worst
*NL*
that
he
has
told
you
.
I
must
know
what
is
the
foul
speech
that
I
am
*NL*
liable
to
be
the
victim
of
,
''
said
Bulstrode
,
a
certain
amount
of
anger
*NL*
beginning
to
mingle
with
his
humiliation
before
this
quiet
man
who
*NL*
renounced
his
benefits
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
needless
,
''
said
Caleb
,
waving
his
hand
,
bowing
his
head
*NL*
slightly
,
and
not
swerving
from
the
tone
which
had
in
it
the
merciful
*NL*
intention
to
spare
this
pitiable
man
.
``
What
he
has
said
to
me
will
*NL*
never
pass
from
my
lips
,
unless
something
now
unknown
forces
it
from
*NL*
me
.
If
you
led
a
harmful
life
for
gain
,
and
kept
others
out
of
their
*NL*
rights
by
deceit
,
to
get
the
more
for
yourself
,
I
dare
say
you
*NL*
repent
--
you
would
like
to
go
back
,
and
ca
n't
:
that
must
be
a
bitter
*NL*
thing
''
--
Caleb
paused
a
moment
and
shook
his
head
--
``
it
is
not
for
me
to
*NL*
make
your
life
harder
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
do
--
you
do
make
it
harder
to
me
,
''
said
Bulstrode
constrained
*NL*
into
a
genuine
,
pleading
cry
.
``
You
make
it
harder
to
me
by
turning
*NL*
your
back
on
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
I
'm
forced
to
do
,
''
said
Caleb
,
still
more
gently
,
lifting
up
his
*NL*
hand
.
``
I
am
sorry
.
I
do
n't
judge
you
and
say
,
he
is
wicked
,
and
I
am
*NL*
righteous
.
God
forbid
.
I
do
n't
know
everything
.
A
man
may
do
wrong
,
*NL*
and
his
will
may
rise
clear
out
of
it
,
though
he
ca
n't
get
his
life
*NL*
clear
.
That
's
a
bad
punishment
.
If
it
is
so
with
you
,
--
well
,
I
'm
*NL*
very
sorry
for
you
.
But
I
have
that
feeling
inside
me
,
that
I
ca
n't
go
*NL*
on
working
with
you
.
That
's
all
,
Mr.
Bulstrode
.
Everything
else
is
*NL*
buried
,
so
far
as
my
will
goes
.
And
I
wish
you
good-day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
moment
,
Mr.
Garth
!
''
said
Bulstrode
,
hurriedly
.
``
I
may
trust
then
*NL*
to
your
solemn
assurance
that
you
will
not
repeat
either
to
man
or
*NL*
woman
what
--
even
if
it
have
any
degree
of
truth
in
it
--
is
yet
a
*NL*
malicious
representation
?
''
Caleb
's
wrath
was
stirred
,
and
he
said
,
*NL*
indignantly
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
should
I
have
said
it
if
I
did
n't
mean
it
?
I
am
in
no
fear
of
*NL*
you
.
Such
tales
as
that
will
never
tempt
my
tongue
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excuse
me
--
I
am
agitated
--
I
am
the
victim
of
this
abandoned
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stop
a
bit
!
you
have
got
to
consider
whether
you
did
n't
help
to
make
*NL*
him
worse
,
when
you
profited
by
his
vices
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
wronging
me
by
too
readily
believing
him
,
''
said
Bulstrode
,
*NL*
oppressed
,
as
by
a
nightmare
,
with
the
inability
to
deny
flatly
what
*NL*
Raffles
might
have
said
;
and
yet
feeling
it
an
escape
that
Caleb
had
*NL*
not
so
stated
it
to
him
as
to
ask
for
that
flat
denial
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Caleb
,
lifting
his
hand
deprecatingly
;
``
I
am
ready
to
*NL*
believe
better
,
when
better
is
proved
.
I
rob
you
of
no
good
chance
.
*NL*
As
to
speaking
,
I
hold
it
a
crime
to
expose
a
man
's
sin
unless
I
'm
*NL*
clear
it
must
be
done
to
save
the
innocent
.
That
is
my
way
of
*NL*
thinking
,
Mr.
Bulstrode
,
and
what
I
say
,
I
've
no
need
to
swear
.
I
wish
*NL*
you
good-day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Some
hours
later
,
when
he
was
at
home
,
Caleb
said
to
his
wife
,
*NL*
incidentally
,
that
he
had
had
some
little
differences
with
Bulstrode
,
*NL*
and
that
in
consequence
,
he
had
given
up
all
notion
of
taking
Stone
*NL*
Court
,
and
indeed
had
resigned
doing
further
business
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
was
disposed
to
interfere
too
much
,
was
he
?
''
said
Mrs.
Garth
,
*NL*
imagining
that
her
husband
had
been
touched
on
his
sensitive
point
,
and
*NL*
not
been
allowed
to
do
what
he
thought
right
as
to
materials
and
modes
*NL*
of
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
said
Caleb
,
bowing
his
head
and
waving
his
hand
gravely
.
And
*NL*
Mrs.
Garth
knew
that
this
was
a
sign
of
his
not
intending
to
speak
*NL*
further
on
the
subject
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
Bulstrode
,
he
had
almost
immediately
mounted
his
horse
and
set
*NL*
off
for
Stone
Court
,
being
anxious
to
arrive
there
before
Lydgate
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
mind
was
crowded
with
images
and
conjectures
,
which
were
a
language
*NL*
to
his
hopes
and
fears
,
just
as
we
hear
tones
from
the
vibrations
which
*NL*
shake
our
whole
system
.
The
deep
humiliation
with
which
he
had
winced
*NL*
under
Caleb
Garth
's
knowledge
of
his
past
and
rejection
of
his
*NL*
patronage
,
alternated
with
and
almost
gave
way
to
the
sense
of
safety
*NL*
in
the
fact
that
Garth
,
and
no
other
,
had
been
the
man
to
whom
Raffles
*NL*
had
spoken
.
It
seemed
to
him
a
sort
of
earnest
that
Providence
*NL*
intended
his
rescue
from
worse
consequences
;
the
way
being
thus
left
*NL*
open
for
the
hope
of
secrecy
.
That
Raffles
should
be
afflicted
with
*NL*
illness
,
that
he
should
have
been
led
to
Stone
Court
rather
than
*NL*
elsewhere
--
Bulstrode
's
heart
fluttered
at
the
vision
of
probabilities
*NL*
which
these
events
conjured
up
.
If
it
should
turn
out
that
he
was
*NL*
freed
from
all
danger
of
disgrace
--
if
he
could
breathe
in
perfect
*NL*
liberty
--
his
life
should
be
more
consecrated
than
it
had
ever
been
*NL*
before
.
He
mentally
lifted
up
this
vow
as
if
it
would
urge
the
result
*NL*
he
longed
for
--
he
tried
to
believe
in
the
potency
of
that
prayerful
*NL*
resolution
--
its
potency
to
determine
death
.
He
knew
that
he
ought
to
*NL*
say
,
``
Thy
will
be
done
;
''
and
he
said
it
often
.
But
the
intense
desire
*NL*
remained
that
the
will
of
God
might
be
the
death
of
that
hated
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
when
he
arrived
at
Stone
Court
he
could
not
see
the
change
in
*NL*
Raffles
without
a
shock
.
But
for
his
pallor
and
feebleness
,
Bulstrode
*NL*
would
have
called
the
change
in
him
entirely
mental
.
Instead
of
his
*NL*
loud
tormenting
mood
,
he
showed
an
intense
,
vague
terror
,
and
seemed
to
*NL*
deprecate
Bulstrode
's
anger
,
because
the
money
was
all
gone
--
he
had
*NL*
been
robbed
--
it
had
half
of
it
been
taken
from
him
.
He
had
only
come
*NL*
here
because
he
was
ill
and
somebody
was
hunting
him
--
somebody
was
*NL*
after
him
,
he
had
told
nobody
anything
,
he
had
kept
his
mouth
shut
.
*NL*
Bulstrode
,
not
knowing
the
significance
of
these
symptoms
,
interpreted
*NL*
this
new
nervous
susceptibility
into
a
means
of
alarming
Raffles
into
*NL*
true
confessions
,
and
taxed
him
with
falsehood
in
saying
that
he
had
*NL*
not
told
anything
,
since
he
had
just
told
the
man
who
took
him
up
in
*NL*
his
gig
and
brought
him
to
Stone
Court
.
Raffles
denied
this
with
*NL*
solemn
adjurations
;
the
fact
being
that
the
links
of
consciousness
were
*NL*
interrupted
in
him
,
and
that
his
minute
terror-stricken
narrative
to
*NL*
Caleb
Garth
had
been
delivered
under
a
set
of
visionary
impulses
which
*NL*
had
dropped
back
into
darkness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bulstrode
's
heart
sank
again
at
this
sign
that
he
could
get
no
grasp
*NL*
over
the
wretched
man
's
mind
,
and
that
no
word
of
Raffles
could
be
*NL*
trusted
as
to
the
fact
which
he
most
wanted
to
know
,
namely
,
whether
or
*NL*
not
he
had
really
kept
silence
to
every
one
in
the
neighborhood
except
*NL*
Caleb
Garth
.
The
housekeeper
had
told
him
without
the
least
constraint
*NL*
of
manner
that
since
Mr.
Garth
left
,
Raffles
had
asked
her
for
beer
,
*NL*
and
after
that
had
not
spoken
,
seeming
very
ill
.
On
that
side
it
might
*NL*
be
concluded
that
there
had
been
no
betrayal
.
Mrs.
Abel
thought
,
like
*NL*
the
servants
at
The
Shrubs
,
that
the
strange
man
belonged
to
the
*NL*
unpleasant
``
kin
''
who
are
among
the
troubles
of
the
rich
;
she
had
at
*NL*
first
referred
the
kinship
to
Mr.
Rigg
,
and
where
there
was
property
*NL*
left
,
the
buzzing
presence
of
such
large
blue-bottles
seemed
natural
*NL*
enough
.
How
he
could
be
``
kin
''
to
Bulstrode
as
well
was
not
so
clear
,
*NL*
but
Mrs.
Abel
agreed
with
her
husband
that
there
was
``
no
knowing
,
''
a
*NL*
proposition
which
had
a
great
deal
of
mental
food
for
her
,
so
that
she
*NL*
shook
her
head
over
it
without
further
speculation
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
less
than
an
hour
Lydgate
arrived
.
Bulstrode
met
him
outside
the
*NL*
wainscoted
parlor
,
where
Raffles
was
,
and
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
called
you
in
,
Mr.
Lydgate
,
to
an
unfortunate
man
who
was
once
*NL*
in
my
employment
,
many
years
ago
.
Afterwards
he
went
to
America
,
and
*NL*
returned
I
fear
to
an
idle
dissolute
life
.
Being
destitute
,
he
has
a
*NL*
claim
on
me
.
He
was
slightly
connected
with
Rigg
,
the
former
owner
of
*NL*
this
place
,
and
in
consequence
found
his
way
here
.
I
believe
he
is
*NL*
seriously
ill
:
apparently
his
mind
is
affected
.
I
feel
bound
to
do
the
*NL*
utmost
for
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lydgate
,
who
had
the
remembrance
of
his
last
conversation
with
*NL*
Bulstrode
strongly
upon
him
,
was
not
disposed
to
say
an
unnecessary
*NL*
word
to
him
,
and
bowed
slightly
in
answer
to
this
account
;
but
just
*NL*
before
entering
the
room
he
turned
automatically
and
said
,
``
What
is
his
*NL*
name
?
''
--
to
know
names
being
as
much
a
part
of
the
medical
man
's
*NL*
accomplishment
as
of
the
practical
politician
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Raffles
,
John
Raffles
,
''
said
Bulstrode
,
who
hoped
that
whatever
became
*NL*
of
Raffles
,
Lydgate
would
never
know
any
more
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
had
thoroughly
examined
and
considered
the
patient
,
Lydgate
*NL*
ordered
that
he
should
go
to
bed
,
and
be
kept
there
in
as
complete
*NL*
quiet
as
possible
,
and
then
went
with
Bulstrode
into
another
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
serious
case
,
I
apprehend
,
''
said
the
banker
,
before
Lydgate
*NL*
began
to
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
and
yes
,
''
said
Lydgate
,
half
dubiously
.
``
It
is
difficult
to
*NL*
decide
as
to
the
possible
effect
of
long-standing
complications
;
but
*NL*
the
man
had
a
robust
constitution
to
begin
with
.
I
should
not
expect
*NL*
this
attack
to
be
fatal
,
though
of
course
the
system
is
in
a
ticklish
*NL*
state
.
He
should
be
well
watched
and
attended
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
remain
here
myself
,
''
said
Bulstrode
.
``
Mrs.
Abel
and
her
*NL*
husband
are
inexperienced
.
I
can
easily
remain
here
for
the
night
,
if
*NL*
you
will
oblige
me
by
taking
a
note
for
Mrs.
Bulstrode
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
think
that
is
hardly
necessary
,
''
said
Lydgate
.
``
He
seems
*NL*
tame
and
terrified
enough
.
He
might
become
more
unmanageable
.
But
*NL*
there
is
a
man
here
--
is
there
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
more
than
once
stayed
here
a
few
nights
for
the
sake
of
*NL*
seclusion
,
''
said
Bulstrode
,
indifferently
;
``
I
am
quite
disposed
to
do
*NL*
so
now
.
Mrs.
Abel
and
her
husband
can
relieve
or
aid
me
,
if
necessary
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
.
Then
I
need
give
my
directions
only
to
you
,
''
said
Lydgate
,
*NL*
not
feeling
surprised
at
a
little
peculiarity
in
Bulstrode
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
think
,
then
,
that
the
case
is
hopeful
?
''
said
Bulstrode
,
when
*NL*
Lydgate
had
ended
giving
his
orders
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Unless
there
turn
out
to
be
further
complications
,
such
as
I
have
not
*NL*
at
present
detected
--
yes
,
''
said
Lydgate
.
``
He
may
pass
on
to
a
worse
*NL*
stage
;
but
I
should
not
wonder
if
he
got
better
in
a
few
days
,
by
*NL*
adhering
to
the
treatment
I
have
prescribed
.
There
must
be
firmness
.
*NL*
Remember
,
if
he
calls
for
liquors
of
any
sort
,
not
to
give
them
to
him
.
*NL*
In
my
opinion
,
men
in
his
condition
are
oftener
killed
by
treatment
*NL*
than
by
the
disease
.
Still
,
new
symptoms
may
arise
.
I
shall
come
*NL*
again
to-morrow
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
waiting
for
the
note
to
be
carried
to
Mrs.
Bulstrode
,
Lydgate
*NL*
rode
away
,
forming
no
conjectures
,
in
the
first
instance
,
about
the
*NL*
history
of
Raffles
,
but
rehearsing
the
whole
argument
,
which
had
lately
*NL*
been
much
stirred
by
the
publication
of
Dr.
Ware
's
abundant
experience
*NL*
in
America
,
as
to
the
right
way
of
treating
cases
of
alcoholic
*NL*
poisoning
such
as
this
.
Lydgate
,
when
abroad
,
had
already
been
*NL*
interested
in
this
question
:
he
was
strongly
convinced
against
the
*NL*
prevalent
practice
of
allowing
alcohol
and
persistently
administering
*NL*
large
doses
of
opium
;
and
he
had
repeatedly
acted
on
this
conviction
*NL*
with
a
favorable
result
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
man
is
in
a
diseased
state
,
''
he
thought
,
``
but
there
's
a
good
deal
*NL*
of
wear
in
him
still
.
I
suppose
he
is
an
object
of
charity
to
*NL*
Bulstrode
.
It
is
curious
what
patches
of
hardness
and
tenderness
lie
*NL*
side
by
side
in
men
's
dispositions
.
Bulstrode
seems
the
most
*NL*
unsympathetic
fellow
I
ever
saw
about
some
people
,
and
yet
he
has
taken
*NL*
no
end
of
trouble
,
and
spent
a
great
deal
of
money
,
on
benevolent
*NL*
objects
.
I
suppose
he
has
some
test
by
which
he
finds
out
whom
Heaven
*NL*
cares
for
--
he
has
made
up
his
mind
that
it
does
n't
care
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
streak
of
bitterness
came
from
a
plenteous
source
,
and
kept
*NL*
widening
in
the
current
of
his
thought
as
he
neared
Lowick
Gate
.
He
*NL*
had
not
been
there
since
his
first
interview
with
Bulstrode
in
the
*NL*
morning
,
having
been
found
at
the
Hospital
by
the
banker
's
messenger
;
*NL*
and
for
the
first
time
he
was
returning
to
his
home
without
the
vision
*NL*
of
any
expedient
in
the
background
which
left
him
a
hope
of
raising
*NL*
money
enough
to
deliver
him
from
the
coming
destitution
of
everything
*NL*
which
made
his
married
life
tolerable
--
everything
which
saved
him
and
*NL*
Rosamond
from
that
bare
isolation
in
which
they
would
be
forced
to
*NL*
recognize
how
little
of
a
comfort
they
could
be
to
each
other
.
It
was
*NL*
more
bearable
to
do
without
tenderness
for
himself
than
to
see
that
his
*NL*
own
tenderness
could
make
no
amends
for
the
lack
of
other
things
to
*NL*
her
.
The
sufferings
of
his
own
pride
from
humiliations
past
and
to
*NL*
come
were
keen
enough
,
yet
they
were
hardly
distinguishable
to
himself
*NL*
from
that
more
acute
pain
which
dominated
them
--
the
pain
of
foreseeing
*NL*
that
Rosamond
would
come
to
regard
him
chiefly
as
the
cause
of
*NL*
disappointment
and
unhappiness
to
her
.
He
had
never
liked
the
*NL*
makeshifts
of
poverty
,
and
they
had
never
before
entered
into
his
*NL*
prospects
for
himself
;
but
he
was
beginning
now
to
imagine
how
two
*NL*
creatures
who
loved
each
other
,
and
had
a
stock
of
thoughts
in
common
,
*NL*
might
laugh
over
their
shabby
furniture
,
and
their
calculations
how
far
*NL*
they
could
afford
butter
and
eggs
.
But
the
glimpse
of
that
poetry
*NL*
seemed
as
far
off
from
him
as
the
carelessness
of
the
golden
age
;
in
*NL*
poor
Rosamond
's
mind
there
was
not
room
enough
for
luxuries
to
look
*NL*
small
in
.
He
got
down
from
his
horse
in
a
very
sad
mood
,
and
went
into
*NL*
the
house
,
not
expecting
to
be
cheered
except
by
his
dinner
,
and
*NL*
reflecting
that
before
the
evening
closed
it
would
be
wise
to
tell
*NL*
Rosamond
of
his
application
to
Bulstrode
and
its
failure
.
It
would
be
*NL*
well
not
to
lose
time
in
preparing
her
for
the
worst
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
his
dinner
waited
long
for
him
before
he
was
able
to
eat
it
.
For
*NL*
on
entering
he
found
that
Dover
's
agent
had
already
put
a
man
in
the
*NL*
house
,
and
when
he
asked
where
Mrs.
Lydgate
was
,
he
was
told
that
she
*NL*
was
in
her
bedroom
.
He
went
up
and
found
her
stretched
on
the
bed
pale
*NL*
and
silent
,
without
an
answer
even
in
her
face
to
any
word
or
look
of
*NL*
his
.
He
sat
down
by
the
bed
and
leaning
over
her
said
with
almost
a
*NL*
cry
of
prayer
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Forgive
me
for
this
misery
,
my
poor
Rosamond
!
Let
us
only
love
one
*NL*
another
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
at
him
silently
,
still
with
the
blank
despair
on
her
face
;
*NL*
but
then
the
tears
began
to
fill
her
blue
eyes
,
and
her
lip
trembled
.
*NL*
The
strong
man
had
had
too
much
to
bear
that
day
.
He
let
his
head
fall
*NL*
beside
hers
and
sobbed
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
hinder
her
from
going
to
her
father
early
in
the
morning
--
it
*NL*
seemed
now
that
he
ought
not
to
hinder
her
from
doing
as
she
*NL*
pleased
.
In
half
an
hour
she
came
back
,
and
said
that
papa
and
mamma
*NL*
wished
her
to
go
and
stay
with
them
while
things
were
in
this
miserable
*NL*
state
.
Papa
said
he
could
do
nothing
about
the
debt
--
if
he
paid
this
,
*NL*
there
would
be
half-a-dozen
more
.
She
had
better
come
back
home
again
*NL*
till
Lydgate
had
got
a
comfortable
home
for
her
.
``
Do
you
object
,
*NL*
Tertius
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
as
you
like
,
''
said
Lydgate
.
``
But
things
are
not
coming
to
a
crisis
*NL*
immediately
.
There
is
no
hurry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
not
go
till
to-morrow
,
''
said
Rosamond
;
``
I
shall
want
to
pack
*NL*
my
clothes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
would
wait
a
little
longer
than
to-morrow
--
there
is
no
knowing
*NL*
what
may
happen
,
''
said
Lydgate
,
with
bitter
irony
.
``
I
may
get
my
neck
*NL*
broken
,
and
that
may
make
things
easier
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
Lydgate
's
misfortune
and
Rosamond
's
too
,
that
his
tenderness
*NL*
towards
her
,
which
was
both
an
emotional
prompting
and
a
*NL*
well-considered
resolve
,
was
inevitably
interrupted
by
these
outbursts
*NL*
of
indignation
either
ironical
or
remonstrant
.
She
thought
them
*NL*
totally
unwarranted
,
and
the
repulsion
which
this
exceptional
severity
*NL*
excited
in
her
was
in
danger
of
making
the
more
persistent
tenderness
*NL*
unacceptable
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
you
do
not
wish
me
to
go
,
''
she
said
,
with
chill
mildness
;
``
why
*NL*
can
you
not
say
so
,
without
that
kind
of
violence
?
I
shall
stay
until
*NL*
you
request
me
to
do
otherwise
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lydgate
said
no
more
,
but
went
out
on
his
rounds
.
He
felt
bruised
and
*NL*
shattered
,
and
there
was
a
dark
line
under
his
eyes
which
Rosamond
had
*NL*
not
seen
before
.
She
could
not
bear
to
look
at
him
.
Tertius
had
a
way
*NL*
of
taking
things
which
made
them
a
great
deal
worse
for
her
.

Bulstrode
's
first
object
after
Lydgate
had
left
Stone
Court
was
to

examine
Raffles
's
pockets
,
which
he
imagined
were
sure
to
carry
signs
*NL*
in
the
shape
of
hotel-bills
of
the
places
he
had
stopped
in
,
if
he
had
*NL*
not
told
the
truth
in
saying
that
he
had
come
straight
from
Liverpool
*NL*
because
he
was
ill
and
had
no
money
.
There
were
various
bills
crammed
*NL*
into
his
pocketbook
,
but
none
of
a
later
date
than
Christmas
at
any
*NL*
other
place
,
except
one
,
which
bore
date
that
morning
.
This
was
*NL*
crumpled
up
with
a
hand-bill
about
a
horse-fair
in
one
of
his
*NL*
tail-pockets
,
and
represented
the
cost
of
three
days
'
stay
at
an
inn
at
*NL*
Bilkley
,
where
the
fair
was
held
--
a
town
at
least
forty
miles
from
*NL*
Middlemarch
.
The
bill
was
heavy
,
and
since
Raffles
had
no
luggage
with
*NL*
him
,
it
seemed
probable
that
he
had
left
his
portmanteau
behind
in
*NL*
payment
,
in
order
to
save
money
for
his
travelling
fare
;
for
his
purse
*NL*
was
empty
,
and
he
had
only
a
couple
of
sixpences
and
some
loose
pence
*NL*
in
his
pockets
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bulstrode
gathered
a
sense
of
safety
from
these
indications
that
*NL*
Raffles
had
really
kept
at
a
distance
from
Middlemarch
since
his
*NL*
memorable
visit
at
Christmas
.
At
a
distance
and
among
people
who
were
*NL*
strangers
to
Bulstrode
,
what
satisfaction
could
there
be
to
Raffles
's
*NL*
tormenting
,
self-magnifying
vein
in
telling
old
scandalous
stories
*NL*
about
a
Middlemarch
banker
?
And
what
harm
if
he
did
talk
?
The
chief
*NL*
point
now
was
to
keep
watch
over
him
as
long
as
there
was
any
danger
of
*NL*
that
intelligible
raving
,
that
unaccountable
impulse
to
tell
,
which
*NL*
seemed
to
have
acted
towards
Caleb
Garth
;
and
Bulstrode
felt
much
*NL*
anxiety
lest
some
such
impulse
should
come
over
him
at
the
sight
of
*NL*
Lydgate
.
He
sat
up
alone
with
him
through
the
night
,
only
ordering
the
*NL*
housekeeper
to
lie
down
in
her
clothes
,
so
as
to
be
ready
when
he
*NL*
called
her
,
alleging
his
own
indisposition
to
sleep
,
and
his
anxiety
to
*NL*
carry
out
the
doctor
's
orders
.
He
did
carry
them
out
faithfully
,
*NL*
although
Raffles
was
incessantly
asking
for
brandy
,
and
declaring
that
*NL*
he
was
sinking
away
--
that
the
earth
was
sinking
away
from
under
him
.
*NL*
He
was
restless
and
sleepless
,
but
still
quailing
and
manageable
.
On
*NL*
the
offer
of
the
food
ordered
by
Lydgate
,
which
he
refused
,
and
the
*NL*
denial
of
other
things
which
he
demanded
,
he
seemed
to
concentrate
all
*NL*
his
terror
on
Bulstrode
,
imploringly
deprecating
his
anger
,
his
revenge
*NL*
on
him
by
starvation
,
and
declaring
with
strong
oaths
that
he
had
never
*NL*
told
any
mortal
a
word
against
him
.
Even
this
Bulstrode
felt
that
he
*NL*
would
not
have
liked
Lydgate
to
hear
;
but
a
more
alarming
sign
of
*NL*
fitful
alternation
in
his
delirium
was
,
that
in-the
morning
twilight
*NL*
Raffles
suddenly
seemed
to
imagine
a
doctor
present
,
addressing
him
and
*NL*
declaring
that
Bulstrode
wanted
to
starve
him
to
death
out
of
revenge
*NL*
for
telling
,
when
he
never
had
told
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bulstrode
's
native
imperiousness
and
strength
of
determination
served
*NL*
him
well
.
This
delicate-looking
man
,
himself
nervously
perturbed
,
*NL*
found
the
needed
stimulus
in
his
strenuous
circumstances
,
and
through
*NL*
that
difficult
night
and
morning
,
while
he
had
the
air
of
an
animated
*NL*
corpse
returned
to
movement
without
warmth
,
holding
the
mastery
by
its
*NL*
chill
impassibility
his
mind
was
intensely
at
work
thinking
of
what
he
*NL*
had
to
guard
against
and
what
would
win
him
security
.
Whatever
prayers
*NL*
he
might
lift
up
,
whatever
statements
he
might
inwardly
make
of
this
*NL*
man
's
wretched
spiritual
condition
,
and
the
duty
he
himself
was
under
*NL*
to
submit
to
the
punishment
divinely
appointed
for
him
rather
than
to
*NL*
wish
for
evil
to
another
--
through
all
this
effort
to
condense
words
*NL*
into
a
solid
mental
state
,
there
pierced
and
spread
with
irresistible
*NL*
vividness
the
images
of
the
events
he
desired
.
And
in
the
train
of
*NL*
those
images
came
their
apology
.
He
could
not
but
see
the
death
of
*NL*
Raffles
,
and
see
in
it
his
own
deliverance
.
What
was
the
removal
of
*NL*
this
wretched
creature
?
He
was
impenitent
--
but
were
not
public
*NL*
criminals
impenitent
?
--
yet
the
law
decided
on
their
fate
.
Should
*NL*
Providence
in
this
case
award
death
,
there
was
no
sin
in
contemplating
*NL*
death
as
the
desirable
issue
--
if
he
kept
his
hands
from
hastening
*NL*
it
--
if
he
scrupulously
did
what
was
prescribed
.
Even
here
there
might
*NL*
be
a
mistake
:
human
prescriptions
were
fallible
things
:
Lydgate
had
*NL*
said
that
treatment
had
hastened
death
,
--
why
not
his
own
method
of
*NL*
treatment
?
But
of
course
intention
was
everything
in
the
question
of
*NL*
right
and
wrong
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
Bulstrode
set
himself
to
keep
his
intention
separate
from
his
*NL*
desire
.
He
inwardly
declared
that
he
intended
to
obey
orders
.
Why
*NL*
should
he
have
got
into
any
argument
about
the
validity
of
these
*NL*
orders
?
It
was
only
the
common
trick
of
desire
--
which
avails
itself
of
*NL*
any
irrelevant
scepticism
,
finding
larger
room
for
itself
in
all
*NL*
uncertainty
about
effects
,
in
every
obscurity
that
looks
like
the
*NL*
absence
of
law
.
Still
,
he
did
obey
the
orders
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
anxieties
continually
glanced
towards
Lydgate
,
and
his
remembrance
*NL*
of
what
had
taken
place
between
them
the
morning
before
was
accompanied
*NL*
with
sensibilities
which
had
not
been
roused
at
all
during
the
actual
*NL*
scene
.
He
had
then
cared
but
little
about
Lydgate
's
painful
*NL*
impressions
with
regard
to
the
suggested
change
in
the
Hospital
,
or
*NL*
about
the
disposition
towards
himself
which
what
he
held
to
be
his
*NL*
justifiable
refusal
of
a
rather
exorbitant
request
might
call
forth
.
*NL*
He
recurred
to
the
scene
now
with
a
perception
that
he
had
probably
*NL*
made
Lydgate
his
enemy
,
and
with
an
awakened
desire
to
propitiate
him
,
*NL*
or
rather
to
create
in
him
a
strong
sense
of
personal
obligation
.
He
*NL*
regretted
that
he
had
not
at
once
made
even
an
unreasonable
*NL*
money-sacrifice
.
For
in
case
of
unpleasant
suspicions
,
or
even
*NL*
knowledge
gathered
from
the
raving
of
Raffles
,
Bulstrode
would
have
*NL*
felt
that
he
had
a
defence
in
Lydgate
's
mind
by
having
conferred
a
*NL*
momentous
benefit
on
him
.
But
the
regret
had
perhaps
come
too
late
.
*NL*
*NL*
Strange
,
piteous
conflict
in
the
soul
of
this
unhappy
man
,
who
had
*NL*
longed
for
years
to
be
better
than
he
was
--
who
had
taken
his
selfish
*NL*
passions
into
discipline
and
clad
them
in
severe
robes
,
so
that
he
had
*NL*
walked
with
them
as
a
devout
choir
,
till
now
that
a
terror
had
risen
*NL*
among
them
,
and
they
could
chant
no
longer
,
but
threw
out
their
common
*NL*
cries
for
safety
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
nearly
the
middle
of
the
day
before
Lydgate
arrived
:
he
had
*NL*
meant
to
come
earlier
,
but
had
been
detained
,
he
said
;
and
his
*NL*
shattered
looks
were
noticed
by
Balstrode
.
But
he
immediately
threw
*NL*
himself
into
the
consideration
of
the
patient
,
and
inquired
strictly
*NL*
into
all
that
had
occurred
.
Raffles
was
worse
,
would
take
hardly
any
*NL*
food
,
was
persistently
wakeful
and
restlessly
raving
;
but
still
not
*NL*
violent
.
Contrary
to
Bulstrode
's
alarmed
expectation
,
he
took
little
*NL*
notice
of
Lydgate
's
presence
,
and
continued
to
talk
or
murmur
*NL*
incoherently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
think
of
him
?
''
said
Bulstrode
,
in
private
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
symptoms
are
worse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
less
hopeful
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
I
still
think
he
may
come
round
.
Are
you
going
to
stay
here
*NL*
yourself
?
''
said
Lydgate
,
looking
at
Bulstrode
with
an
abrupt
question
,
*NL*
which
made
him
uneasy
,
though
in
reality
it
was
not
due
to
any
*NL*
suspicious
conjecture
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
think
so
,
''
said
Bulstrode
,
governing
himself
and
speaking
with
*NL*
deliberation
.
``
Mrs.
Bulstrode
is
advised
of
the
reasons
which
detain
*NL*
me
.
Mrs.
Abel
and
her
husband
are
not
experienced
enough
to
be
left
*NL*
quite
alone
,
and
this
kind
of
responsibility
is
scarcely
included
in
*NL*
their
service
of
me
.
You
have
some
fresh
instructions
,
I
presume
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
chief
new
instruction
that
Lydgate
had
to
give
was
on
the
*NL*
administration
of
extremely
moderate
doses
of
opium
,
in
case
of
the
*NL*
sleeplessness
continuing
after
several
hours
.
He
had
taken
the
*NL*
precaution
of
bringing
opium
in
his
pocket
,
and
he
gave
minute
*NL*
directions
to
Bulstrode
as
to
the
doses
,
and
the
point
at
which
they
*NL*
should
cease
.
He
insisted
on
the
risk
of
not
ceasing
;
and
repeated
his
*NL*
order
that
no
alcohol
should
be
given
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
what
I
see
of
the
case
,
''
he
ended
,
``
narcotism
is
the
only
thing
I
*NL*
should
be
much
afraid
of
.
He
may
wear
through
even
without
much
food
.
*NL*
There
's
a
good
deal
of
strength
in
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
look
ill
yourself
,
Mr.
Lydgate
--
a
most
unusual
,
I
may
say
*NL*
unprecedented
thing
in
my
knowledge
of
you
,
''
said
Bulstrode
,
showing
a
*NL*
solicitude
as
unlike
his
indifference
the
day
before
,
as
his
present
*NL*
recklessness
about
his
own
fatigue
was
unlike
his
habitual
*NL*
self-cherishing
anxiety
.
``
I
fear
you
are
harassed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
am
,
''
said
Lydgate
,
brusquely
,
holding
his
hat
,
and
ready
to
go
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Something
new
,
I
fear
,
''
said
Bulstrode
,
inquiringly
.
``
Pray
be
seated
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
thank
you
,
''
said
Lydgate
,
with
some
hauteur
.
``
I
mentioned
to
you
*NL*
yesterday
what
was
the
state
of
my
affairs
.
There
is
nothing
to
add
,
*NL*
except
that
the
execution
has
since
then
been
actually
put
into
my
*NL*
house
.
One
can
tell
a
good
deal
of
trouble
in
a
short
sentence
.
I
*NL*
will
say
good
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stay
,
Mr.
Lydgate
,
stay
,
''
said
Bulstrode
;
``
I
have
been
reconsidering
*NL*
this
subject
.
I
was
yesterday
taken
by
surprise
,
and
saw
it
*NL*
superficially
.
Mrs.
Bulstrode
is
anxious
for
her
niece
,
and
I
myself
*NL*
should
grieve
at
a
calamitous
change
in
your
position
.
Claims
on
me
*NL*
are
numerous
,
but
on
reconsideration
,
I
esteem
it
right
that
I
should
*NL*
incur
a
small
sacrifice
rather
than
leave
you
unaided
.
You
said
,
I
*NL*
think
,
that
a
thousand
pounds
would
suffice
entirely
to
free
you
from
*NL*
your
burthens
,
and
enable
you
to
recover
a
firm
stand
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Lydgate
,
a
great
leap
of
joy
within
him
surmounting
every
*NL*
other
feeling
;
``
that
would
pay
all
my
debts
,
and
leave
me
a
little
on
*NL*
hand
.
I
could
set
about
economizing
in
our
way
of
living
.
And
*NL*
by-and-by
my
practice
might
look
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
will
wait
a
moment
,
Mr.
Lydgate
,
I
will
draw
a
check
to
that
*NL*
amount
.
I
am
aware
that
help
,
to
be
effectual
in
these
cases
,
should
*NL*
be
thorough
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
Bulstrode
wrote
,
Lydgate
turned
to
the
window
thinking
of
his
*NL*
home
--
thinking
of
his
life
with
its
good
start
saved
from
frustration
,
*NL*
its
good
purposes
still
unbroken
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
give
me
a
note
of
hand
for
this
,
Mr.
Lydgate
,
''
said
the
*NL*
banker
,
advancing
towards
him
with
the
check
.
``
And
by-and-by
,
I
hope
,
*NL*
you
may
be
in
circumstances
gradually
to
repay
me
.
Meanwhile
,
I
have
*NL*
pleasure
in
thinking
that
you
will
be
released
from
further
difficulty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
deeply
obliged
to
you
,
''
said
Lydgate
.
``
You
have
restored
to
me
*NL*
the
prospect
of
working
with
some
happiness
and
some
chance
of
good
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
appeared
to
him
a
very
natural
movement
in
Bulstrode
that
he
should
*NL*
have
reconsidered
his
refusal
:
it
corresponded
with
the
more
munificent
*NL*
side
of
his
character
.
But
as
he
put
his
hack
into
a
canter
,
that
he
*NL*
might
get
the
sooner
home
,
and
tell
the
good
news
to
Rosamond
,
and
get
*NL*
cash
at
the
bank
to
pay
over
to
Dover
's
agent
,
there
crossed
his
mind
,
*NL*
with
an
unpleasant
impression
,
as
from
a
dark-winged
flight
of
evil
*NL*
augury
across
his
vision
,
the
thought
of
that
contrast
in
himself
which
*NL*
a
few
months
had
brought
--
that
he
should
be
overjoyed
at
being
under
a
*NL*
strong
personal
obligation
--
that
he
should
be
overjoyed
at
getting
*NL*
money
for
himself
from
Bulstrode
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
banker
felt
that
he
had
done
something
to
nullify
one
cause
of
*NL*
uneasiness
,
and
yet
he
was
scarcely
the
easier
.
He
did
not
measure
the
*NL*
quantity
of
diseased
motive
which
had
made
him
wish
for
Lydgate
's
*NL*
good-will
,
but
the
quantity
was
none
the
less
actively
there
,
like
an
*NL*
irritating
agent
in
his
blood
.
A
man
vows
,
and
yet
will
not
cast
away
*NL*
the
means
of
breaking
his
vow
.
Is
it
that
he
distinctly
means
to
break
*NL*
it
?
Not
at
all
;
but
the
desires
which
tend
to
break
it
are
at
work
in
*NL*
him
dimly
,
and
make
their
way
into
his
imagination
,
and
relax
his
*NL*
muscles
in
the
very
moments
when
he
is
telling
himself
over
again
the
*NL*
reasons
for
his
vow
.
Raffles
,
recovering
quickly
,
returning
to
the
*NL*
free
use
of
his
odious
powers
--
how
could
Bulstrode
wish
for
that
?
*NL*
Raffles
dead
was
the
image
that
brought
release
,
and
indirectly
he
*NL*
prayed
for
that
way
of
release
,
beseeching
that
,
if
it
were
possible
,
*NL*
the
rest
of
his
days
here
below
might
be
freed
from
the
threat
of
an
*NL*
ignominy
which
would
break
him
utterly
as
an
instrument
of
God
's
*NL*
service
.
Lydgate
's
opinion
was
not
on
the
side
of
promise
that
this
*NL*
prayer
would
be
fulfilled
;
and
as
the
day
advanced
,
Bulstrode
felt
*NL*
himself
getting
irritated
at
the
persistent
life
in
this
man
,
whom
he
*NL*
would
fain
have
seen
sinking
into
the
silence
of
death
:
imperious
will
*NL*
stirred
murderous
impulses
towards
this
brute
life
,
over
which
will
,
by
*NL*
itself
,
had
no
power
.
He
said
inwardly
that
he
was
getting
too
much
*NL*
worn
;
he
would
not
sit
up
with
the
patient
to-night
,
but
leave
him
to
*NL*
Mrs.
Abel
,
who
,
if
necessary
,
could
call
her
husband
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
six
o'clock
,
Raffles
,
having
had
only
fitful
perturbed
snatches
of
*NL*
sleep
,
from
which
he
waked
with
fresh
restlessness
and
perpetual
cries
*NL*
that
he
was
sinking
away
,
Bulstrode
began
to
administer
the
opium
*NL*
according
to
Lydgate
's
directions
.
At
the
end
of
half
an
hour
or
more
*NL*
he
called
Mrs.
Abel
and
told
her
that
he
found
himself
unfit
for
*NL*
further
watching
.
He
must
now
consign
the
patient
to
her
care
;
and
he
*NL*
proceeded
to
repeat
to
her
Lydgate
's
directions
as
to
the
quantity
of
*NL*
each
dose
.
Mrs.
Abel
had
not
before
known
anything
of
Lydgate
's
*NL*
prescriptions
;
she
had
simply
prepared
and
brought
whatever
Bulstrode
*NL*
ordered
,
and
had
done
what
he
pointed
out
to
her
.
She
began
now
to
ask
*NL*
what
else
she
should
do
besides
administering
the
opium
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
at
present
,
except
the
offer
of
the
soup
or
the
soda-water
:
*NL*
you
can
come
to
me
for
further
directions
.
Unless
there
is
any
*NL*
important
change
,
I
shall
not
come
into
the
room
again
to-night
.
You
*NL*
will
ask
your
husband
for
help
if
necessary
.
I
must
go
to
bed
early
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
much
need
,
sir
,
I
'm
sure
,
''
said
Mrs.
Abel
,
``
and
to
take
*NL*
something
more
strengthening
than
what
you
've
done
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bulstrode
went
away
now
without
anxiety
as
to
what
Raffles
might
say
in
*NL*
his
raving
,
which
had
taken
on
a
muttering
incoherence
not
likely
to
*NL*
create
any
dangerous
belief
.
At
any
rate
he
must
risk
this
.
He
went
*NL*
down
into
the
wainscoted
parlor
first
,
and
began
to
consider
whether
he
*NL*
would
not
have
his
horse
saddled
and
go
home
by
the
moonlight
,
and
give
*NL*
up
caring
for
earthly
consequences
.
Then
,
he
wished
that
he
had
begged
*NL*
Lydgate
to
come
again
that
evening
.
Perhaps
he
might
deliver
a
*NL*
different
opinion
,
and
think
that
Raffles
was
getting
into
a
less
*NL*
hopeful
state
.
Should
he
send
for
Lydgate
?
If
Raffles
were
really
*NL*
getting
worse
,
and
slowly
dying
,
Bulstrode
felt
that
he
could
go
to
bed
*NL*
and
sleep
in
gratitude
to
Providence
.
But
was
he
worse
?
Lydgate
might
*NL*
come
and
simply
say
that
he
was
going
on
as
he
expected
,
and
predict
*NL*
that
he
would
by-and-by
fall
into
a
good
sleep
,
and
get
well
.
What
was
*NL*
the
use
of
sending
for
him
?
Bulstrode
shrank
from
that
result
.
No
*NL*
ideas
or
opinions
could
hinder
him
from
seeing
the
one
probability
to
*NL*
be
,
that
Raffles
recovered
would
be
just
the
same
man
as
before
,
with
*NL*
his
strength
as
a
tormentor
renewed
,
obliging
him
to
drag
away
his
wife
*NL*
to
spend
her
years
apart
from
her
friends
and
native
place
,
carrying
an
*NL*
alienating
suspicion
against
him
in
her
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
sat
an
hour
and
a
half
in
this
conflict
by
the
firelight
only
,
*NL*
when
a
sudden
thought
made
him
rise
and
light
the
bed-candle
,
which
he
*NL*
had
brought
down
with
him
.
The
thought
was
,
that
he
had
not
told
Mrs.
*NL*
Abel
when
the
doses
of
opium
must
cease
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
hold
of
the
candlestick
,
but
stood
motionless
for
a
long
while
.
*NL*
She
might
already
have
given
him
more
than
Lydgate
had
prescribed
.
But
*NL*
it
was
excusable
in
him
,
that
he
should
forget
part
of
an
order
,
in
his
*NL*
present
wearied
condition
.
He
walked
up-stairs
,
candle
in
hand
,
not
*NL*
knowing
whether
he
should
straightway
enter
his
own
room
and
go
to
bed
,
*NL*
or
turn
to
the
patient
's
room
and
rectify
his
omission
.
He
paused
in
*NL*
the
passage
,
with
his
face
turned
towards
Raffles
's
room
,
and
he
could
*NL*
hear
him
moaning
and
murmuring
.
He
was
not
asleep
,
then
.
Who
could
*NL*
know
that
Lydgate
's
prescription
would
not
be
better
disobeyed
than
*NL*
followed
,
since
there
was
still
no
sleep
?
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
into
his
own
room
.
Before
he
had
quite
undressed
,
Mrs.
Abel
*NL*
rapped
at
the
door
;
he
opened
it
an
inch
,
so
that
he
could
hear
her
*NL*
speak
low
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
please
,
sir
,
should
I
have
no
brandy
nor
nothing
to
give
the
*NL*
poor
creetur
?
He
feels
sinking
away
,
and
nothing
else
will
he
*NL*
swaller
--
and
but
little
strength
in
it
,
if
he
did
--
only
the
opium
.
And
*NL*
he
says
more
and
more
he
's
sinking
down
through
the
earth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
her
surprise
,
Mr.
Bulstrode
did
not
answer
.
A
struggle
was
going
on
*NL*
within
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
he
must
die
for
want
o
'
support
,
if
he
goes
on
in
that
way
.
*NL*
When
I
nursed
my
poor
master
,
Mr.
Robisson
,
I
had
to
give
him
port-wine
*NL*
and
brandy
constant
,
and
a
big
glass
at
a
time
,
''
added
Mrs.
Abel
,
with
*NL*
a
touch
of
remonstrance
in
her
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
again
Mr.
Bulstrode
did
not
answer
immediately
,
and
she
continued
,
*NL*
``
It
's
not
a
time
to
spare
when
people
are
at
death
's
door
,
nor
would
*NL*
you
wish
it
,
sir
,
I
'm
sure
.
Else
I
should
give
him
our
own
bottle
o
'
*NL*
rum
as
we
keep
by
us
.
But
a
sitter-up
so
as
you
've
been
,
and
doing
*NL*
everything
as
laid
in
your
power
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
a
key
was
thrust
through
the
inch
of
doorway
,
and
Mr.
Bulstrode
*NL*
said
huskily
,
``
That
is
the
key
of
the
wine-cooler
.
You
will
find
plenty
*NL*
of
brandy
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Early
in
the
morning
--
about
six
--
Mr.
Bulstrode
rose
and
spent
some
time
*NL*
in
prayer
.
Does
any
one
suppose
that
private
prayer
is
necessarily
*NL*
candid
--
necessarily
goes
to
the
roots
of
action
?
Private
prayer
is
*NL*
inaudible
speech
,
and
speech
is
representative
:
who
can
represent
*NL*
himself
just
as
he
is
,
even
in
his
own
reflections
?
Bulstrode
had
not
*NL*
yet
unravelled
in
his
thought
the
confused
promptings
of
the
last
*NL*
four-and-twenty
hours
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
listened
in
the
passage
,
and
could
hear
hard
stertorous
breathing
.
*NL*
Then
he
walked
out
in
the
garden
,
and
looked
at
the
early
rime
on
the
*NL*
grass
and
fresh
spring
leaves
.
When
he
re-entered
the
house
,
he
felt
*NL*
startled
at
the
sight
of
Mrs.
Abel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
is
your
patient
--
asleep
,
I
think
?
''
he
said
,
with
an
attempt
at
*NL*
cheerfulness
in
his
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
gone
very
deep
,
sir
,
''
said
Mrs.
Abel
.
``
He
went
off
gradual
*NL*
between
three
and
four
o'clock
.
Would
you
please
to
go
and
look
at
*NL*
him
?
I
thought
it
no
harm
to
leave
him
.
My
man
's
gone
afield
,
and
the
*NL*
little
girl
's
seeing
to
the
kettles
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bulstrode
went
up
.
At
a
glance
he
knew
that
Raffles
was
not
in
the
*NL*
sleep
which
brings
revival
,
but
in
the
sleep
which
streams
deeper
and
*NL*
deeper
into
the
gulf
of
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
round
the
room
and
saw
a
bottle
with
some
brandy
in
it
,
and
*NL*
the
almost
empty
opium
phial
.
He
put
the
phial
out
of
sight
,
and
*NL*
carried
the
brandy-bottle
down-stairs
with
him
,
locking
it
again
in
the
*NL*
wine-cooler
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
breakfasting
he
considered
whether
he
should
ride
to
Middlemarch
*NL*
at
once
,
or
wait
for
Lydgate
's
arrival
.
He
decided
to
wait
,
and
told
*NL*
Mrs.
Abel
that
she
might
go
about
her
work
--
he
could
watch
in
the
*NL*
bed-chamber
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
sat
there
and
beheld
the
enemy
of
his
peace
going
irrevocably
*NL*
into
silence
,
he
felt
more
at
rest
than
he
had
done
for
many
months
.
*NL*
His
conscience
was
soothed
by
the
enfolding
wing
of
secrecy
,
which
*NL*
seemed
just
then
like
an
angel
sent
down
for
his
relief
.
He
drew
out
*NL*
his
pocket-book
to
review
various
memoranda
there
as
to
the
*NL*
arrangements
he
had
projected
and
partly
carried
out
in
the
prospect
of
*NL*
quitting
Middlemarch
,
and
considered
how
far
he
would
let
them
stand
or
*NL*
recall
them
,
now
that
his
absence
would
be
brief
.
Some
economies
which
*NL*
he
felt
desirable
might
still
find
a
suitable
occasion
in
his
temporary
*NL*
withdrawal
from
management
,
and
he
hoped
still
that
Mrs.
Casaubon
would
*NL*
take
a
large
share
in
the
expenses
of
the
Hospital
.
In
that
way
the
*NL*
moments
passed
,
until
a
change
in
the
stertorous
breathing
was
marked
*NL*
enough
to
draw
his
attention
wholly
to
the
bed
,
and
forced
him
to
think
*NL*
of
the
departing
life
,
which
had
once
been
subservient
to
his
*NL*
own
--
which
he
had
once
been
glad
to
find
base
enough
for
him
to
act
on
*NL*
as
he
would
.
It
was
his
gladness
then
which
impelled
him
now
to
be
*NL*
glad
that
the
life
was
at
an
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
who
could
say
that
the
death
of
Raffles
had
been
hastened
?
Who
*NL*
knew
what
would
have
saved
him
?
*NL*
*NL*
Lydgate
arrived
at
half-past
ten
,
in
time
to
witness
the
final
pause
of
*NL*
the
breath
.
When
he
entered
the
room
Bulstrode
observed
a
sudden
*NL*
expression
in
his
face
,
which
was
not
so
much
surprise
as
a
recognition
*NL*
that
he
had
not
judged
correctly
.
He
stood
by
the
bed
in
silence
for
*NL*
some
time
,
with
his
eyes
turned
on
the
dying
man
,
but
with
that
subdued
*NL*
activity
of
expression
which
showed
that
he
was
carrying
on
an
inward
*NL*
debate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
did
this
change
begin
?
''
said
he
,
looking
at
Bulstrode
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
not
watch
by
him
last
night
,
''
said
Bulstrode
.
``
I
was
over-worn
,
*NL*
and
left
him
under
Mrs.
Abel
's
care
.
She
said
that
he
sank
into
sleep
*NL*
between
three
and
four
o'clock
.
When
I
came
in
before
eight
he
was
*NL*
nearly
in
this
condition
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lydgate
did
not
ask
another
question
,
but
watched
in
silence
until
he
*NL*
said
,
``
It
's
all
over
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
morning
Lydgate
was
in
a
state
of
recovered
hope
and
freedom
.
He
*NL*
had
set
out
on
his
work
with
all
his
old
animation
,
and
felt
himself
*NL*
strong
enough
to
bear
all
the
deficiencies
of
his
married
life
.
And
he
*NL*
was
conscious
that
Bulstrode
had
been
a
benefactor
to
him
.
But
he
was
*NL*
uneasy
about
this
case
.
He
had
not
expected
it
to
terminate
as
it
had
*NL*
done
.
Yet
he
hardly
knew
how
to
put
a
question
on
the
subject
to
*NL*
Bulstrode
without
appearing
to
insult
him
;
and
if
he
examined
the
*NL*
housekeeper
--
why
,
the
man
was
dead
.
There
seemed
to
be
no
use
in
*NL*
implying
that
somebody
's
ignorance
or
imprudence
had
killed
him
.
And
*NL*
after
all
,
he
himself
might
be
wrong
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
and
Bulstrode
rode
back
to
Middlemarch
together
,
talking
of
many
*NL*
things
--
chiefly
cholera
and
the
chances
of
the
Reform
Bill
in
the
House
*NL*
of
Lords
,
and
the
firm
resolve
of
the
political
Unions
.
Nothing
was
*NL*
said
about
Raffles
,
except
that
Bulstrode
mentioned
the
necessity
of
*NL*
having
a
grave
for
him
in
Lowick
churchyard
,
and
observed
that
,
so
far
*NL*
as
he
knew
,
the
poor
man
had
no
connections
,
except
Rigg
,
whom
he
had
*NL*
stated
to
be
unfriendly
towards
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
returning
home
Lydgate
had
a
visit
from
Mr.
Farebrother
.
The
Vicar
*NL*
had
not
been
in
the
town
the
day
before
,
but
the
news
that
there
was
an
*NL*
execution
in
Lydgate
's
house
had
got
to
Lowick
by
the
evening
,
having
*NL*
been
carried
by
Mr.
Spicer
,
shoemaker
and
parish-clerk
,
who
had
it
from
*NL*
his
brother
,
the
respectable
bell-hanger
in
Lowick
Gate
.
Since
that
*NL*
evening
when
Lydgate
had
come
down
from
the
billiard
room
with
Fred
*NL*
Vincy
,
Mr.
Farebrother
's
thoughts
about
him
had
been
rather
gloomy
.
*NL*
Playing
at
the
Green
Dragon
once
or
oftener
might
have
been
a
trifle
in
*NL*
another
man
;
but
in
Lydgate
it
was
one
of
several
signs
that
he
was
*NL*
getting
unlike
his
former
self
.
He
was
beginning
to
do
things
for
*NL*
which
he
had
formerly
even
an
excessive
scorn
.
Whatever
certain
*NL*
dissatisfactions
in
marriage
,
which
some
silly
tinklings
of
gossip
had
*NL*
given
him
hints
of
,
might
have
to
do
with
this
change
,
Mr.
Farebrother
*NL*
felt
sure
that
it
was
chiefly
connected
with
the
debts
which
were
being
*NL*
more
and
more
distinctly
reported
,
and
he
began
to
fear
that
any
notion
*NL*
of
Lydgate
's
having
resources
or
friends
in
the
background
must
be
*NL*
quite
illusory
.
The
rebuff
he
had
met
with
in
his
first
attempt
to
win
*NL*
Lydgate
's
confidence
,
disinclined
him
to
a
second
;
but
this
news
of
the
*NL*
execution
being
actually
in
the
house
,
determined
the
Vicar
to
overcome
*NL*
his
reluctance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lydgate
had
just
dismissed
a
poor
patient
,
in
whom
he
was
much
*NL*
interested
,
and
he
came
forward
to
put
out
his
hand
--
with
an
open
*NL*
cheerfulness
which
surprised
Mr.
Farebrother
.
Could
this
too
be
a
*NL*
proud
rejection
of
sympathy
and
help
?
Never
mind
;
the
sympathy
and
*NL*
help
should
be
offered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
are
you
,
Lydgate
?
I
came
to
see
you
because
I
had
heard
something
*NL*
which
made
me
anxious
about
you
,
''
said
the
Vicar
,
in
the
tone
of
a
good
*NL*
brother
,
only
that
there
was
no
reproach
in
it
.
They
were
both
seated
*NL*
by
this
time
,
and
Lydgate
answered
immediately
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
know
what
you
mean
.
You
had
heard
that
there
was
an
*NL*
execution
in
the
house
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
is
it
true
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
true
,
''
said
Lydgate
,
with
an
air
of
freedom
,
as
if
he
did
not
*NL*
mind
talking
about
the
affair
now
.
``
But
the
danger
is
over
;
the
debt
*NL*
is
paid
.
I
am
out
of
my
difficulties
now
:
I
shall
be
freed
from
debts
,
*NL*
and
able
,
I
hope
,
to
start
afresh
on
a
better
plan
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
thankful
to
hear
it
,
''
said
the
Vicar
,
falling
back
in
his
*NL*
chair
,
and
speaking
with
that
low-toned
quickness
which
often
follows
*NL*
the
removal
of
a
load
.
``
I
like
that
better
than
all
the
news
in
the
*NL*
`
Times
.
'
I
confess
I
came
to
you
with
a
heavy
heart
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
for
coming
,
''
said
Lydgate
,
cordially
.
``
I
can
enjoy
the
*NL*
kindness
all
the
more
because
I
am
happier
.
I
have
certainly
been
a
*NL*
good
deal
crushed
.
I
'm
afraid
I
shall
find
the
bruises
still
painful
*NL*
by-and
by
,
''
he
added
,
smiling
rather
sadly
;
``
but
just
now
I
can
only
*NL*
feel
that
the
torture-screw
is
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Farebrother
was
silent
for
a
moment
,
and
then
said
earnestly
,
``
My
*NL*
dear
fellow
,
let
me
ask
you
one
question
.
Forgive
me
if
I
take
a
*NL*
liberty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
believe
you
will
ask
anything
that
ought
to
offend
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
--
this
is
necessary
to
set
my
heart
quite
at
rest
--
you
have
*NL*
not
--
have
you
?
--
in
order
to
pay
your
debts
,
incurred
another
debt
which
*NL*
may
harass
you
worse
hereafter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Lydgate
,
coloring
slightly
.
``
There
is
no
reason
why
I
*NL*
should
not
tell
you
--
since
the
fact
is
so
--
that
the
person
to
whom
I
am
*NL*
indebted
is
Bulstrode
.
He
has
made
me
a
very
handsome
advance
--
a
*NL*
thousand
pounds
--
and
he
can
afford
to
wait
for
repayment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
that
is
generous
,
''
said
Mr.
Farebrother
,
compelling
himself
to
*NL*
approve
of
the
man
whom
he
disliked
.
His
delicate
feeling
shrank
from
*NL*
dwelling
even
in
his
thought
on
the
fact
that
he
had
always
urged
*NL*
Lydgate
to
avoid
any
personal
entanglement
with
Bulstrode
.
He
added
*NL*
immediately
,
``
And
Bulstrode
must
naturally
feel
an
interest
in
your
*NL*
welfare
,
after
you
have
worked
with
him
in
a
way
which
has
probably
*NL*
reduced
your
income
instead
of
adding
to
it
.
I
am
glad
to
think
that
*NL*
he
has
acted
accordingly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lydgate
felt
uncomfortable
under
these
kindly
suppositions
.
They
made
*NL*
more
distinct
within
him
the
uneasy
consciousness
which
had
shown
its
*NL*
first
dim
stirrings
only
a
few
hours
before
,
that
Bulstrode
's
motives
*NL*
for
his
sudden
beneficence
following
close
upon
the
chillest
*NL*
indifference
might
be
merely
selfish
.
He
let
the
kindly
suppositions
*NL*
pass
.
He
could
not
tell
the
history
of
the
loan
,
but
it
was
more
*NL*
vividly
present
with
him
than
ever
,
as
well
as
the
fact
which
the
Vicar
*NL*
delicately
ignored
--
that
this
relation
of
personal
indebtedness
to
*NL*
Bulstrode
was
what
he
had
once
been
most
resolved
to
avoid
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
began
,
instead
of
answering
,
to
speak
of
his
projected
economies
,
*NL*
and
of
his
having
come
to
look
at
his
life
from
a
different
point
of
*NL*
view
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
set
up
a
surgery
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
really
think
I
made
a
mistaken
*NL*
effort
in
that
respect
.
And
if
Rosamond
will
not
mind
,
I
shall
take
an
*NL*
apprentice
.
I
do
n't
like
these
things
,
but
if
one
carries
them
out
*NL*
faithfully
they
are
not
really
lowering
.
I
have
had
a
severe
galling
*NL*
to
begin
with
:
that
will
make
the
small
rubs
seem
easy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Lydgate
!
the
``
if
Rosamond
will
not
mind
,
''
which
had
fallen
from
*NL*
him
involuntarily
as
part
of
his
thought
,
was
a
significant
mark
of
the
*NL*
yoke
he
bore
.
But
Mr.
Farebrother
,
whose
hopes
entered
strongly
into
*NL*
the
same
current
with
Lydgate
's
,
and
who
knew
nothing
about
him
that
*NL*
could
now
raise
a
melancholy
presentiment
,
left
him
with
affectionate
*NL*
congratulation

Five
days
after
the
death
of
Raffles
,
Mr.
Bambridge
was
standing
at
his
*NL*
leisure
under
the
large
archway
leading
into
the
yard
of
the
Green
*NL*
Dragon
.
He
was
not
fond
of
solitary
contemplation
,
but
he
had
only
*NL*
just
come
out
of
the
house
,
and
any
human
figure
standing
at
ease
under
*NL*
the
archway
in
the
early
afternoon
was
as
certain
to
attract
*NL*
companionship
as
a
pigeon
which
has
found
something
worth
pecking
at
.
*NL*
In
this
case
there
was
no
material
object
to
feed
upon
,
but
the
eye
of
*NL*
reason
saw
a
probability
of
mental
sustenance
in
the
shape
of
gossip
.
*NL*
Mr.
Hopkins
,
the
meek-mannered
draper
opposite
,
was
the
first
to
act
on
*NL*
this
inward
vision
,
being
the
more
ambitious
of
a
little
masculine
talk
*NL*
because
his
customers
were
chiefly
women
.
Mr.
Bambridge
was
rather
*NL*
curt
to
the
draper
,
feeling
that
Hopkins
was
of
course
glad
to
talk
to
*NL*
_
him
_
,
but
that
he
was
not
going
to
waste
much
of
his
talk
on
Hopkins
.
*NL*
Soon
,
however
,
there
was
a
small
cluster
of
more
important
listeners
,
*NL*
who
were
either
deposited
from
the
passers-by
,
or
had
sauntered
to
the
*NL*
spot
expressly
to
see
if
there
were
anything
going
on
at
the
Green
*NL*
Dragon
;
and
Mr.
Bambridge
was
finding
it
worth
his
while
to
say
many
*NL*
impressive
things
about
the
fine
studs
he
had
been
seeing
and
the
*NL*
purchases
he
had
made
on
a
journey
in
the
north
from
which
he
had
just
*NL*
returned
.
Gentlemen
present
were
assured
that
when
they
could
show
him
*NL*
anything
to
cut
out
a
blood
mare
,
a
bay
,
rising
four
,
which
was
to
be
*NL*
seen
at
Doncaster
if
they
chose
to
go
and
look
at
it
,
Mr.
Bambridge
*NL*
would
gratify
them
by
being
shot
``
from
here
to
Hereford
.
''
Also
,
a
pair
*NL*
of
blacks
which
he
was
going
to
put
into
the
break
recalled
vividly
to
*NL*
his
mind
a
pair
which
he
had
sold
to
Faulkner
in
'
19
,
for
a
hundred
*NL*
guineas
,
and
which
Faulkner
had
sold
for
a
hundred
and
sixty
two
months
*NL*
later
--
any
gent
who
could
disprove
this
statement
being
offered
the
*NL*
privilege
of
calling
Mr.
Bambridge
by
a
very
ugly
name
until
the
*NL*
exercise
made
his
throat
dry
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
discourse
was
at
this
point
of
animation
,
came
up
Mr.
Frank
*NL*
Hawley
.
He
was
not
a
man
to
compromise
his
dignity
by
lounging
at
the
*NL*
Green
Dragon
,
but
happening
to
pass
along
the
High
Street
and
seeing
*NL*
Bambridge
on
the
other
side
,
he
took
some
of
his
long
strides
across
to
*NL*
ask
the
horsedealer
whether
he
had
found
the
first-rate
gig-horse
which
*NL*
he
had
engaged
to
look
for
.
Mr.
Hawley
was
requested
to
wait
until
he
*NL*
had
seen
a
gray
selected
at
Bilkley
:
if
that
did
not
meet
his
wishes
to
*NL*
a
hair
,
Bambridge
did
not
know
a
horse
when
he
saw
it
,
which
seemed
to
*NL*
be
the
highest
conceivable
unlikelihood
.
Mr.
Hawley
,
standing
with
his
*NL*
back
to
the
street
,
was
fixing
a
time
for
looking
at
the
gray
and
*NL*
seeing
it
tried
,
when
a
horseman
passed
slowly
by
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bulstrode
!
''
said
two
or
three
voices
at
once
in
a
low
tone
,
one
of
*NL*
them
,
which
was
the
draper
's
,
respectfully
prefixing
the
``
Mr.
;
''
but
*NL*
nobody
having
more
intention
in
this
interjectural
naming
than
if
they
*NL*
had
said
``
the
Riverston
coach
''
when
that
vehicle
appeared
in
the
*NL*
distance
.
Mr.
Hawley
gave
a
careless
glance
round
at
Bulstrode
's
back
,
*NL*
but
as
Bambridge
's
eyes
followed
it
he
made
a
sarcastic
grimace
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
jingo
!
that
reminds
me
,
''
he
began
,
lowering
his
voice
a
little
,
``
I
*NL*
picked
up
something
else
at
Bilkley
besides
your
gig-horse
,
Mr.
Hawley
.
*NL*
I
picked
up
a
fine
story
about
Bulstrode
.
Do
you
know
how
he
came
by
*NL*
his
fortune
?
Any
gentleman
wanting
a
bit
of
curious
information
,
I
can
*NL*
give
it
him
free
of
expense
.
If
everybody
got
their
deserts
,
Bulstrode
*NL*
might
have
had
to
say
his
prayers
at
Botany
Bay
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
?
''
said
Mr.
Hawley
,
thrusting
his
hands
into
his
*NL*
pockets
,
and
pushing
a
little
forward
under
the
archway
.
If
Bulstrode
*NL*
should
turn
out
to
be
a
rascal
,
Frank
Hawley
had
a
prophetic
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
it
from
a
party
who
was
an
old
chum
of
Bulstrode
's
.
I
'll
tell
*NL*
you
where
I
first
picked
him
up
,
''
said
Bambridge
,
with
a
sudden
gesture
*NL*
of
his
fore-finger
.
``
He
was
at
Larcher
's
sale
,
but
I
knew
nothing
of
*NL*
him
then
--
he
slipped
through
my
fingers
--
was
after
Bulstrode
,
no
*NL*
doubt
.
He
tells
me
he
can
tap
Bulstrode
to
any
amount
,
knows
all
his
*NL*
secrets
.
However
,
he
blabbed
to
me
at
Bilkley
:
he
takes
a
stiff
glass
.
*NL*
Damme
if
I
think
he
meant
to
turn
king
's
evidence
;
but
he
's
that
sort
*NL*
of
bragging
fellow
,
the
bragging
runs
over
hedge
and
ditch
with
him
,
*NL*
till
he
'd
brag
of
a
spavin
as
if
it
`
ud
fetch
money
.
A
man
should
know
*NL*
when
to
pull
up
.
''
Mr.
Bambridge
made
this
remark
with
an
air
of
*NL*
disgust
,
satisfied
that
his
own
bragging
showed
a
fine
sense
of
the
*NL*
marketable
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
man
's
name
?
Where
can
he
be
found
?
''
said
Mr.
Hawley
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
to
where
he
is
to
be
found
,
I
left
him
to
it
at
the
Saracen
's
Head
;
*NL*
but
his
name
is
Raffles
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Raffles
!
''
exclaimed
Mr.
Hopkins
.
``
I
furnished
his
funeral
yesterday
.
*NL*
He
was
buried
at
Lowick
.
Mr.
Bulstrode
followed
him
.
A
very
decent
*NL*
funeral
.
''
There
was
a
strong
sensation
among
the
listeners
.
Mr.
*NL*
Bambridge
gave
an
ejaculation
in
which
``
brimstone
''
was
the
mildest
*NL*
word
,
and
Mr.
Hawley
,
knitting
his
brows
and
bending
his
head
forward
,
*NL*
exclaimed
,
``
What
?
--
where
did
the
man
die
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
Stone
Court

''
said
the
draper
.
``

housekeeper

*NL*
*NL*
``

was

interposed
*NL*
Bambridge
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did

attend

said
Mr.
Hawley
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

``

Mr.

insistently

``
What
did
this

*NL*
*NL*
The
group
had
already
become
larger
,
the
town-clerk
's
presence
being
a
*NL*
guarantee
that
something
worth
listening
to
was
going
on
there
;
and
Mr.
*NL*
Bambridge
delivered
his
narrative
in
the
hearing
of
seven
.
It
was
*NL*
mainly
what
we
know
,
including
the
fact
about
Will
Ladislaw
,
with
some
*NL*
local
color
and
circumstance
added
:
it
was
what
Bulstrode
had
dreaded
*NL*
the
betrayal
of
--
and
hoped
to
have
buried
forever
with
the
corpse
of
*NL*
Raffles
--
it
was
that
haunting
ghost
of
his
earlier
life
which
as
he
*NL*
rode
past
the
archway
of
the
Green
Dragon
he
was
trusting
that
*NL*
Providence
had
delivered
him
from
.
Yes
,
Providence
.
He
had
not
*NL*
confessed
to
himself
yet
that
he
had
done
anything
in
the
way
of
*NL*
contrivance
to
this
end
;
he
had
accepted
what
seemed
to
have
been
*NL*
offered
.
It
was
impossible
to
prove
that
he
had
done
anything
which
*NL*
hastened
the
departure
of
that
man
's
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
this
gossip
about
Bulstrode
spread
through
Middlemarch
like
the
*NL*
smell
of
fire
.
Mr.
Frank
Hawley
followed
up
his
information
by
sending
*NL*
a
clerk
whom
he
could
trust
to
Stone
Court
on
a
pretext
of
inquiring
*NL*
about
hay
,
but
really
to
gather
all
that
could
be
learned
about
Raffles
*NL*
and
his
illness
from
Mrs.
Abel
.
In
this
way
it
came
to
his
knowledge
*NL*
that
Mr.
Garth
had
carried
the
man
to
Stone
Court
in
his
gig
;
and
Mr.
*NL*
Hawley
in
consequence
took
an
opportunity
of
seeing
Caleb
,
calling
at
*NL*
his
office
to
ask
whether
he
had
time
to
undertake
an
arbitration
if
it
*NL*
were
required
,
and
then
asking
him
incidentally
about
Raffles
.
Caleb
*NL*
was
betrayed
into
no
word
injurious
to
Bulstrode
beyond
the
fact
which
*NL*
he
was
forced
to
admit
,
that
he
had
given
up
acting
for
him
within
the
*NL*
last
week
.
Mr
Hawley
drew
his
inferences
,
and
feeling
convinced
that
*NL*
Raffles
had
told
his
story
to
Garth
,
and
that
Garth
had
given
up
*NL*
Bulstrode
's
affairs
in
consequence
,
said
so
a
few
hours
later
to
Mr.
*NL*
Toller
.
The
statement
was
passed
on
until
it
had
quite
lost
the
stamp
*NL*
of
an
inference
,
and
was
taken
as
information
coming
straight
from
*NL*
Garth
,
so
that
even
a
diligent
historian
might
have
concluded
Caleb
to
*NL*
be
the
chief
publisher
of
Bulstrode
's
misdemeanors
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Hawley
was
not
slow
to
perceive
that
there
was
no
handle
for
the
*NL*
law
either
in
the
revelations
made
by
Raffles
or
in
the
circumstances
*NL*
of
his
death
.
He
had
himself
ridden
to
Lowick
village
that
he
might
*NL*
look
at
the
register
and
talk
over
the
whole
matter
with
Mr.
*NL*
Farebrother
,
who
was
not
more
surprised
than
the
lawyer
that
an
ugly
*NL*
secret
should
have
come
to
light
about
Bulstrode
,
though
he
had
always
*NL*
had
justice
enough
in
him
to
hinder
his
antipathy
from
turning
into
*NL*
conclusions
.
But
while
they
were
talking
another
combination
was
*NL*
silently
going
forward
in
Mr.
Farebrother
's
mind
,
which
foreshadowed
*NL*
what
was
soon
to
be
loudly
spoken
of
in
Middlemarch
as
a
necessary
*NL*
``
putting
of
two
and
two
together
.
''
With
the
reasons
which
kept
*NL*
Bulstrode
in
dread
of
Raffles
there
flashed
the
thought
that
the
dread
*NL*
might
have
something
to
do
with
his
munificence
towards
his
medical
*NL*
man
;
and
though
he
resisted
the
suggestion
that
it
had
been
consciously
*NL*
accepted
in
any
way
as
a
bribe
,
he
had
a
foreboding
that
this
*NL*
complication
of
things
might
be
of
malignant
effect
on
Lydgate
's
*NL*
reputation
.
He
perceived
that
Mr.
Hawley
knew
nothing
at
present
of
*NL*
the
sudden
relief
from
debt
,
and
he
himself
was
careful
to
glide
away
*NL*
from
all
approaches
towards
the
subject
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
he
said
,
with
a
deep
breath
,
wanting
to
wind
up
the
illimitable
*NL*
discussion
of
what
might
have
been
,
though
nothing
could
be
legally
*NL*
proven
,
``
it
is
a
strange
story
.
So
our
mercurial
Ladislaw
has
a
queer
*NL*
genealogy
!
A
high-spirited
young
lady
and
a
musical
Polish
patriot
*NL*
made
a
likely
enough
stock
for
him
to
spring
from
,
but
I
should
never
*NL*
have
suspected
a
grafting
of
the
Jew
pawnbroker
.
However
,
there
's
no
*NL*
knowing
what
a
mixture
will
turn
out
beforehand
.
Some
sorts
of
dirt
*NL*
serve
to
clarify
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
just
what
I
should
have
expected
,
''
said
Mr.
Hawley
,
mounting
his
*NL*
horse
.
``
Any
cursed
alien
blood
,
Jew
,
Corsican
,
or
Gypsy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
he
's
one
of
your
black
sheep
,
Hawley
.
But
he
is
really
a
*NL*
disinterested
,
unworldly
fellow
,
''
said
Mr.
Farebrother
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
ay
,
that
is
your
Whiggish
twist
,
''
said
Mr.
Hawley
,
who
had
been
in
*NL*
the
habit
of
saying
apologetically
that
Farebrother
was
such
a
damned
*NL*
pleasant
good-hearted
fellow
you
would
mistake
him
for
a
Tory
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Hawley
rode
home
without
thinking
of
Lydgate
's
attendance
on
*NL*
Raffles
in
any
other
light
than
as
a
piece
of
evidence
on
the
side
of
*NL*
Bulstrode
.
But
the
news
that
Lydgate
had
all
at
once
become
able
not
*NL*
only
to
get
rid
of
the
execution
in
his
house
but
to
pay
all
his
debts
*NL*
in
Middlemarch
was
spreading
fast
,
gathering
round
it
conjectures
and
*NL*
comments
which
gave
it
new
body
and
impetus
,
and
soon
filling
the
ears
*NL*
of
other
persons
besides
Mr.
Hawley
,
who
were
not
slow
to
see
a
*NL*
significant
relation
between
this
sudden
command
of
money
and
*NL*
Bulstrode
's
desire
to
stifle
the
scandal
of
Raffles
.
That
the
money
*NL*
came
from
Bulstrode
would
infallibly
have
been
guessed
even
if
there
*NL*
had
been
no
direct
evidence
of
it
;
for
it
had
beforehand
entered
into
*NL*
the
gossip
about
Lydgate
's
affairs
,
that
neither
his
father-in-law
nor
*NL*
his
own
family
would
do
anything
for
him
,
and
direct
evidence
was
*NL*
furnished
not
only
by
a
clerk
at
the
Bank
,
but
by
innocent
Mrs.
*NL*
Bulstrode
herself
,
who
mentioned
the
loan
to
Mrs.
Plymdale
,
who
*NL*
mentioned
it
to
her
daughter-in-law
of
the
house
of
Toller
,
who
*NL*
mentioned
it
generally
.
The
business
was
felt
to
be
so
public
and
*NL*
important
that
it
required
dinners
to
feed
it
,
and
many
invitations
*NL*
were
just
then
issued
and
accepted
on
the
strength
of
this
scandal
*NL*
concerning
Bulstrode
and
Lydgate
;
wives
,
widows
,
and
single
ladies
took
*NL*
their
work
and
went
out
to
tea
oftener
than
usual
;
and
all
public
*NL*
conviviality
,
from
the
Green
Dragon
to
Dollop
's
,
gathered
a
zest
which
*NL*
could
not
be
won
from
the
question
whether
the
Lords
would
throw
out
*NL*
the
Reform
Bill
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
hardly
anybody
doubted
that
some
scandalous
reason
or
other
was
at
*NL*
the
bottom
of
Bulstrode
's
liberality
to
Lydgate
.
Mr.
Hawley
indeed
,
in
*NL*
the
first
instance
,
invited
a
select
party
,
including
the
two
*NL*
physicians
,
with
Mr
Toller
and
Mr.
Wrench
,
expressly
to
hold
a
close
*NL*
discussion
as
to
the
probabilities
of
Raffles
's
illness
,
reciting
to
*NL*
them
all
the
particulars
which
had
been
gathered
from
Mrs.
Abel
in
*NL*
connection
with
Lydgate
's
certificate
,
that
the
death
was
due
to
*NL*
delirium
tremens
;
and
the
medical
gentlemen
,
who
all
stood
*NL*
undisturbedly
on
the
old
paths
in
relation
to
this
disease
,
declared
*NL*
that
they
could
see
nothing
in
these
particulars
which
could
be
*NL*
transformed
into
a
positive
ground
of
suspicion
.
But
the
moral
grounds
*NL*
of
suspicion
remained
:
the
strong
motives
Bulstrode
clearly
had
for
*NL*
wishing
to
be
rid
of
Raffles
,
and
the
fact
that
at
this
critical
moment
*NL*
he
had
given
Lydgate
the
help
which
he
must
for
some
time
have
known
*NL*
the
need
for
;
the
disposition
,
moreover
,
to
believe
that
Bulstrode
*NL*
would
be
unscrupulous
,
and
the
absence
of
any
indisposition
to
believe
*NL*
that
Lydgate
might
be
as
easily
bribed
as
other
haughty-minded
men
when
*NL*
they
have
found
themselves
in
want
of
money
.
Even
if
the
money
had
*NL*
been
given
merely
to
make
him
hold
his
tongue
about
the
scandal
of
*NL*
Bulstrode
's
earlier
life
,
the
fact
threw
an
odious
light
on
Lydgate
,
*NL*
who
had
long
been
sneered
at
as
making
himself
subservient
to
the
*NL*
banker
for
the
sake
of
working
himself
into
predominance
,
and
*NL*
discrediting
the
elder
members
of
his
profession
.
Hence
,
in
spite
of
*NL*
the
negative
as
to
any
direct
sign
of
guilt
in
relation
to
the
death
at
*NL*
Stone
Court
,
Mr.
Hawley
's
select
party
broke
up
with
the
sense
that
the
*NL*
affair
had
``
an
ugly
look
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
this
vague
conviction
of
indeterminable
guilt
,
which
was
enough
to
*NL*
keep
up
much
head-shaking
and
biting
innuendo
even
among
substantial
*NL*
professional
seniors
,
had
for
the
general
mind
all
the
superior
power
*NL*
of
mystery
over
fact
.
Everybody
liked
better
to
conjecture
how
the
*NL*
thing
was
,
than
simply
to
know
it
;
for
conjecture
soon
became
more
*NL*
confident
than
knowledge
,
and
had
a
more
liberal
allowance
for
the
*NL*
incompatible
.
Even
the
more
definite
scandal
concerning
Bulstrode
's
*NL*
earlier
life
was
,
for
some
minds
,
melted
into
the
mass
of
mystery
,
as
*NL*
so
much
lively
metal
to
be
poured
out
in
dialogue
,
and
to
take
such
*NL*
fantastic
shapes
as
heaven
pleased
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
tone
of
thought
chiefly
sanctioned
by
Mrs.
Dollop
,
the
*NL*
spirited
landlady
of
the
Tankard
in
Slaughter
Lane
,
who
had
often
to
*NL*
resist
the
shallow
pragmatism
of
customers
disposed
to
think
that
their
*NL*
reports
from
the
outer
world
were
of
equal
force
with
what
had
``
come
*NL*
up
''
in
her
mind
.
How
it
had
been
brought
to
her
she
did
n't
know
,
but
*NL*
it
was
there
before
her
as
if
it
had
been
``
scored
with
the
chalk
on
the
*NL*
chimney-board
--
''
as
Bulstrode
should
say
,
``
his
inside
was
_
that
black
_
*NL*
as
if
the
hairs
of
his
head
knowed
the
thoughts
of
his
heart
,
he
'd
tear
*NL*
'em
up
by
the
roots
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
odd
,
''
said
Mr.
Limp
,
a
meditative
shoemaker
,
with
weak
eyes
and
*NL*
a
piping
voice
.
``
Why
,
I
read
in
the
`
Trumpet
'
that
was
what
the
Duke
*NL*
of
Wellington

his
coat
and
went
over
to

``
Very

Mrs.

said
Mr.

Crabbe

the

gathered
much

groped
among
it
dimly
.

to
laugh
in
a
complimentary
way
at
Mrs.
Dollop
,
as
a
*NL*
woman
who
was
more
than
a
match
for
the
lawyers
;
being
disposed
to
*NL*
submit
to
much
twitting
from
a
landlady
who
had
a
long
score
against
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
they
come
to

,
and
it
's
all
true
as
folks
say
,
there
's
more
*NL*
to
be
looked
to

money

said
the
glazier
.
``
There
's
this
poor
*NL*

as
is
dead

gone

by
what
I
can
make
out

*NL*
*NL*
``
Finer

said
Mrs.
Dollop
;
``
and
a
far
*NL*
personabler

by
what
I
can
hear

As
I
said
when
Mr.

,
the
*NL*
tax-gatherer
,
comes
in
,
a-standing
where
you
sit
,
and
says
,

I
said
,
`
You

That
was
what
I
said
,

Mr.

Baldwin
can
bear
me
witness
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
in
the
rights
of
it
too

said
Mr.
Crabbe
.
``
For

*NL*
``

said
Mrs.
Dallop
,
with
a
touch
of
scorn
at
Mr.

Crabbe
's
apparent
dimness
.
``
When

*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Dollop
looked
round
with
the
air
of
a
landlady
accustomed
to
*NL*
dominate
her
company
.
There
was
a
chorus
of
adhesion
from
the
more
*NL*
courageous
;
but
Mr.
Limp
,
after
taking
a
draught
,
placed
his
flat
hands
*NL*
together
and
pressed
them
hard
between
his
knees
,
looking
down
at
them
*NL*
with
blear-eyed
contemplation
,
as
if
the
scorching
power
of
Mrs.
*NL*
Dollop
's
speech
had
quite
dried
up
and
nullified
his
wits
until
they
*NL*
could
be
brought
round
again
by
further
moisture
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
should
n't
they
dig
the
man
up
and
have
the
Crowner
?
''
said
the
*NL*
dyer
.
``
It
's
been
done
many
and
many

If
there

find
it
out

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
they

Mr.
Jonas

''
said
Mrs
Dollop
,
emphatically
.
``
I
know
what
*NL*
doctors
are
.
They
're
a

too
cunning
to
be
found
out
.
And
this
*NL*
Doctor
Lydgate
that
's
been
for
cutting
up
everybody
before
the
breath
*NL*
was
well
out
o

their
body

it
's
plain
enough
what
use
he
wanted
to
*NL*
make
o

looking
into
respectable
people
's
insides

He
knows
drugs

you
*NL*
may
be
sure
,
as
you
can
neither
smell
nor
see
,
neither
before
they
're

swallowed
nor
after

Why
,
I
've
seen
drops
myself
ordered
by
Doctor
*NL*
Gambit
,
as
is
our

doctor
and
a
good
charikter

has
brought

more

out

have
griped
you
the

I
'll
leave
*NL*
your
own
sense
to
judge

Do
n't
tell
me
!
All
I
say
is
,
it
's
a
mercy
*NL*
they
did
n't
take
this
Doctor
Lydgate
on
to
our
club

There
's
many
a
*NL*
mother

child
might
ha
'
rued
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
heads
of
this
discussion
at
``
Dollop
's
''
had
been
the
common
theme
*NL*
among
all
classes
in
the
town
,
had
been
carried
to
Lowick
Parsonage
on
*NL*
one
side
and
to
Tipton
Grange
on
the
other
,
had
come
fully
to
the
ears
*NL*
of
the
Vincy
family
,
and
had
been
discussed
with
sad
reference
to
``
poor
*NL*
Harriet
''
by
all
Mrs.
Bulstrode
's
friends
,
before
Lydgate
knew
*NL*
distinctly
why
people
were
looking
strangely
at
him
,
and
before
*NL*
Bulstrode
himself
suspected
the
betrayal
of
his
secrets
.
He
had
not
*NL*
been
accustomed
to
very
cordial
relations
with
his
neighbors
,
and
hence
*NL*
he
could
not
miss
the
signs
of
cordiality
;
moreover
,
he
had
been
taking
*NL*
journeys
on
business
of
various
kinds
,
having
now
made
up
his
mind
that
*NL*
he
need
not
quit
Middlemarch
,
and
feeling
able
consequently
to
*NL*
determine
on
matters
which
he
had
before
left
in
suspense
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
will
make
a
journey
to
Cheltenham
in
the
course
of
a
month
or
two
,
''
*NL*
he
had
said
to
his
wife
.
``
There
are
great
spiritual
advantages
to
be
*NL*
had
in
that
town
along
with
the
air
and
the
waters
,
and
six
weeks
there
*NL*
will
be
eminently
refreshing
to
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
really
believed
in
the
spiritual
advantages
,
and
meant
that
his
life
*NL*
henceforth
should
be
the
more
devoted
because
of
those
later
sins
which
*NL*
he
represented
to
himself
as
hypothetic
,
praying
hypothetically
for
*NL*
their
pardon
:
--
``
if
I
have
herein
transgressed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
to
the
Hospital
,
he
avoided
saying
anything
further
to
Lydgate
,
*NL*
fearing
to
manifest
a
too
sudden
change
of
plans
immediately
on
the
*NL*
death
of
Raffles
.
In
his
secret
soul
he
believed
that
Lydgate
*NL*
suspected
his
orders
to
have
been
intentionally
disobeyed
,
and
*NL*
suspecting
this
he
must
also
suspect
a
motive
.
But
nothing
had
been
*NL*
betrayed
to
him
as
to
the
history
of
Raffles
,
and
Bulstrode
was
anxious
*NL*
not
to
do
anything
which
would
give
emphasis
to
his
undefined
*NL*
suspicions
.
As
to
any
certainty
that
a
particular
method
of
treatment
*NL*
would
either
save
or
kill
,
Lydgate
himself
was
constantly
arguing
*NL*
against
such
dogmatism
;
he
had
no
right
to
speak
,
and
he
had
every
*NL*
motive
for
being
silent
.
Hence
Bulstrode
felt
himself
providentially
*NL*
secured
.
The
only
incident
he
had
strongly
winced
under
had
been
an
*NL*
occasional
encounter
with
Caleb
Garth
,
who
,
however
,
had
raised
his
hat
*NL*
with
mild
gravity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
on
the
part
of
the
principal
townsmen
a
strong
determination
*NL*
was
growing
against
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
meeting
was
to
be
held
in
the
Town-Hall
on
a
sanitary
question
which
*NL*
had
risen
into
pressing
importance
by
the
occurrence
of
a
cholera
case
*NL*
in
the
town
.
Since
the
Act
of
Parliament
,
which
had
been
hurriedly
*NL*
passed
,
authorizing
assessments
for
sanitary
measures
,
there
had
been
a
*NL*
Board
for
the
superintendence
of
such
measures
appointed
in
*NL*
Middlemarch
,
and
much
cleansing
and
preparation
had
been
concurred
in
*NL*
by
Whigs
and
Tories
.
The
question
now
was
,
whether
a
piece
of
ground
*NL*
outside
the
town
should
be
secured
as
a
burial-ground
by
means
of
*NL*
assessment
or
by
private
subscription
.
The
meeting
was
to
be
open
,
and
*NL*
almost
everybody
of
importance
in
the
town
was
expected
to
be
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bulstrode
was
a
member
of
the
Board
,
and
just
before
twelve
o'clock
*NL*
he
started
from
the
Bank
with
the
intention
of
urging
the
plan
of
*NL*
private
subscription
.
Under
the
hesitation
of
his
projects
,
he
had
for
*NL*
some
time
kept
himself
in
the
background
,
and
he
felt
that
he
should
*NL*
this
morning
resume
his
old
position
as
a
man
of
action
and
influence
*NL*
in
the
public
affairs
of
the
town
where
he
expected
to
end
his
days
.
*NL*
Among
the
various
persons
going
in
the
same
direction
,
he
saw
Lydgate
;
*NL*
they
joined
,
talked
over
the
object
of
the
meeting
,
and
entered
it
*NL*
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
seemed
that
everybody
of
mark
had
been
earlier
than
they
.
But
there
*NL*
were
still
spaces
left
near
the
head
of
the
large
central
table
,
and
*NL*
they
made
their
way
thither
.
Mr.
Farebrother
sat
opposite
,
not
far
*NL*
from
Mr.
Hawley
;
all
the
medical
men
were
there
;
Mr.
Thesiger
was
in
*NL*
the
chair
,
and
Mr.
Brooke
of
Tipton
was
on
his
right
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lydgate
noticed
a
peculiar
interchange
of
glances
when
he
and
Bulstrode
*NL*
took
their
seats
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
business
had
been
fully
opened
by
the
chairman
,
who
pointed
*NL*
out
the
advantages
of
purchasing
by
subscription
a
piece
of
ground
*NL*
large
enough
to
be
ultimately
used
as
a
general
cemetery
,
Mr.
*NL*
Bulstrode
,
whose
rather
high-pitched
but
subdued
and
fluent
voice
the
*NL*
town
was
used
to
at
meetings
of
this
sort
,
rose
and
asked
leave
to
*NL*
deliver
his
opinion
.
Lydgate
could
see
again
the
peculiar
interchange
*NL*
of
glances
before
Mr.
Hawley
started
up
,
and
said
in
his
firm
resonant
*NL*
voice
,
``
Mr.
Chairman
,
I
request
that
before
any
one
delivers
his
*NL*
opinion
on
this
point
I
may
be
permitted
to
speak
on
a
question
of
*NL*
public
feeling
,
which
not
only
by
myself
,
but
by
many
gentlemen
*NL*
present
,
is
regarded
as
preliminary
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Hawley
's
mode
of
speech
,
even
when
public
decorum
repressed
his
*NL*
``
awful
language
,
''
was
formidable
in
its
curtness
and
self-possession
.
*NL*
Mr.
Thesiger
sanctioned
the
request
,
Mr.
Bulstrode
sat
down
,
and
Mr.
*NL*
Hawley
continued
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
what
I
have
to
say
,
Mr.
Chairman
,
I
am
not
speaking
simply
on
my
*NL*
own
behalf
:
I
am
speaking
with
the
concurrence
and
at
the
express
*NL*
request
of
no
fewer
than
eight
of
my
fellow-townsmen
,
who
are
*NL*
immediately
around
us
.
It
is
our
united
sentiment
that
Mr.
Bulstrode
*NL*
should
be
called
upon
--
and
I
do
now
call
upon
him
--
to
resign
public
*NL*
positions
which
he
holds
not
simply
as
a
tax-payer
,
but
as
a
gentleman
*NL*
among
gentlemen
.
There
are
practices
and
there
are
acts
which
,
owing
*NL*
to
circumstances
,
the
law
can
not
visit
,
though
they
may
be
worse
than
*NL*
many
things
which
are
legally
punishable
.
Honest
men
and
gentlemen
,
if
*NL*
they
do
n't
want
the
company
of
people
who
perpetrate
such
acts
,
have
*NL*
got
to
defend
themselves
as
they
best
can
,
and
that
is
what
I
and
the
*NL*
friends
whom
I
may
call
my
clients
in
this
affair
are
determined
to
do
.
*NL*
I
do
n't
say
that
Mr.
Bulstrode
has
been
guilty
of
shameful
acts
,
but
I
*NL*
call
upon
him
either
publicly
to
deny
and
confute
the
scandalous
*NL*
statements
made
against
him
by
a
man
now
dead
,
and
who
died
in
his
*NL*
house
--
the
statement
that
he
was
for
many
years
engaged
in
nefarious
*NL*
practices
,
and
that
he
won
his
fortune
by
dishonest
procedures
--
or
else
*NL*
to
withdraw
from
positions
which
could
only
have
been
allowed
him
as
a
*NL*
gentleman
among
gentlemen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
eyes
in
the
room
were
turned
on
Mr.
Bulstrode
,
who
,
since
the
first
*NL*
mention
of
his
name
,
had
been
going
through
a
crisis
of
feeling
almost
*NL*
too
violent
for
his
delicate
frame
to
support
.
Lydgate
,
who
himself
*NL*
was
undergoing
a
shock
as
from
the
terrible
practical
interpretation
of
*NL*
some
faint
augury
,
felt
,
nevertheless
,
that
his
own
movement
of
*NL*
resentful
hatred
was
checked
by
that
instinct
of
the
Healer
which
*NL*
thinks
first
of
bringing
rescue
or
relief
to
the
sufferer
,
when
he
*NL*
looked
at
the
shrunken
misery
of
Bulstrode
's
livid
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
quick
vision
that
his
life
was
after
all
a
failure
,
that
he
was
a
*NL*
dishonored
man
,
and
must
quail
before
the
glance
of
those
towards
whom
*NL*
he
had
habitually
assumed
the
attitude
of
a
reprover
--
that
God
had
*NL*
disowned
him
before
men
and
left
him
unscreened
to
the
triumphant
scorn
*NL*
of
those
who
were
glad
to
have
their
hatred
justified
--
the
sense
of
*NL*
utter
futility
in
that
equivocation
with
his
conscience
in
dealing
with
*NL*
the
life
of
his
accomplice
,
an
equivocation
which
now
turned
venomously
*NL*
upon
him
with
the
full-grown
fang
of
a
discovered
lie
:
--
all
this
*NL*
rushed
through
him
like
the
agony
of
terror
which
fails
to
kill
,
and
*NL*
leaves
the
ears
still
open
to
the
returning
wave
of
execration
.
The
*NL*
sudden
sense
of
exposure
after
the
re-established
sense
of
safety
*NL*
came
--
not
to
the
coarse
organization
of
a
criminal
but
to
--
the
*NL*
susceptible
nerve
of
a
man
whose
intensest
being
lay
in
such
mastery
*NL*
and
predominance
as
the
conditions
of
his
life
had
shaped
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
in
that
intense
being
lay
the
strength
of
reaction
.
Through
all
*NL*
his
bodily
infirmity
there
ran
a
tenacious
nerve
of
ambitious
*NL*
self-preserving
will
,
which
had
continually
leaped
out
like
a
flame
,
*NL*
scattering
all
doctrinal
fears
,
and
which
,
even
while
he
sat
an
object
*NL*
of
compassion
for
the
merciful
,
was
beginning
to
stir
and
glow
under
*NL*
his
ashy
paleness
.
Before
the
last
words
were
out
of
Mr.
Hawley
's
*NL*
mouth
,
Bulstrode
felt
that
he
should
answer
,
and
that
his
answer
would
*NL*
be
a
retort
.
He
dared
not
get
up
and
say
,
``
I
am
not
guilty
,
the
whole
*NL*
story
is
false
''
--
even
if
he
had
dared
this
,
it
would
have
seemed
to
*NL*
him
,
under
his
present
keen
sense
of
betrayal
,
as
vain
as
to
pull
,
for
*NL*
covering
to
his
nakedness
,
a
frail
rag
which
would
rend
at
every
little
*NL*
strain
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
few
moments
there
was
total
silence
,
while
every
man
in
the
room
*NL*
was
looking
at
Bulstrode
.
He
sat
perfectly
still
,
leaning
hard
against
*NL*
the
back
of
his
chair
;
he
could
not
venture
to
rise
,
and
when
he
began
*NL*
to
speak
he
pressed
his
hands
upon
the
seat
on
each
side
of
him
.
But
*NL*
his
voice
was
perfectly
audible
,
though
hoarser
than
usual
,
and
his
*NL*
words
were
distinctly
pronounced
,
though
he
paused
between
sentence
as
*NL*
if
short
of
breath
.
He
said
,
turning
first
toward
Mr.
Thesiger
,
and
*NL*
then
looking
at
Mr.
Hawley
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
protest
before
you
,
sir
,
as
a
Christian
minister
,
against
the
*NL*
sanction
of
proceedings
towards
me
which
are
dictated
by
virulent
*NL*
hatred
.
Those
who
are
hostile
to
me
are
glad
to
believe
any
libel
*NL*
uttered
by
a
loose
tongue
against
me
.
And
their
consciences
become
*NL*
strict
against
me
.
Say
that
the
evil-speaking
of
which
I
am
to
be
made
*NL*
the
victim
accuses
me
of
malpractices
--
''
here
Bulstrode
's
voice
rose
*NL*
and
took
on
a
more
biting
accent
,
till
it
seemed
a
low
cry
--
``
who
shall
*NL*
be
my
accuser
?
Not
men
whose
own
lives
are
unchristian
,
nay
,
*NL*
scandalous
--
not
men
who
themselves
use
low
instruments
to
carry
out
*NL*
their
ends
--
whose
profession
is
a
tissue
of
chicanery
--
who
have
been
*NL*
spending
their
income
on
their
own
sensual
enjoyments
,
while
I
have
*NL*
been
devoting
mine
to
advance
the
best
objects
with
regard
to
this
life
*NL*
and
the
next
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
word
chicanery
there
was
a
growing
noise
,
half
of
murmurs
and
*NL*
half
of
hisses
,
while
four
persons
started
up
at
once
--
Mr.
Hawley
,
Mr.
*NL*
Toller
,
Mr.
Chichely
,
and
Mr.
Hackbutt
;
but
Mr.
Hawley
's
outburst
was
*NL*
instantaneous
,
and
left
the
others
behind
in
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
mean
me
,
sir
,
I
call
you
and
every
one
else
to
the
inspection
*NL*
of
my
professional
life
.
As
to
Christian
or
unchristian
,
I
repudiate
*NL*
your
canting
palavering
Christianity
;
and
as
to
the
way
in
which
I
*NL*
spend
my
income
,
it
is
not
my
principle
to
maintain
thieves
and
cheat
*NL*
offspring
of
their
due
inheritance
in
order
to
support
religion
and
set
*NL*
myself
up
as
a
saintly
Killjoy
.
I
affect
no
niceness
of
conscience
--
I
*NL*
have
not
found
any
nice
standards
necessary
yet
to
measure
your
actions
*NL*
by
,
sir
.
And
I
again
call
upon
you
to
enter
into
satisfactory
*NL*
explanations
concerning
the
scandals
against
you
,
or
else
to
withdraw
*NL*
from
posts
in
which
we
at
any
rate
decline
you
as
a
colleague
.
I
say
,
*NL*
sir
,
we
decline
to
co-operate
with
a
man
whose
character
is
not
cleared
*NL*
from
infamous
lights
cast
upon
it
,
not
only
by
reports
but
by
recent
*NL*
actions
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Allow
me
,
Mr.
Hawley
,
''
said
the
chairman
;
and
Mr.
Hawley
,
still
*NL*
fuming
,
bowed
half
impatiently
,
and
sat
down
with
his
hands
thrust
deep
*NL*
in
his
pockets
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Bulstrode
,
it
is
not
desirable
,
I
think
,
to
prolong
the
present
*NL*
discussion
,
''
said
Mr.
Thesiger
,
turning
to
the
pallid
trembling
man
;
``
I
*NL*
must
so
far
concur
with
what
has
fallen
from
Mr.
Hawley
in
expression
*NL*
of
a
general
feeling
,
as
to
think
it
due
to
your
Christian
profession
*NL*
that
you
should
clear
yourself
,
if
possible
,
from
unhappy
aspersions
.
*NL*
I
for
my
part
should
be
willing
to
give
you
full
opportunity
and
*NL*
hearing
.
But
I
must
say
that
your
present
attitude
is
painfully
*NL*
inconsistent
with
those
principles
which
you
have
sought
to
identify
*NL*
yourself
with
,
and
for
the
honor
of
which
I
am
bound
to
care
.
I
*NL*
recommend
you
at
present
,
as
your
clergyman
,
and
one
who
hopes
for
your
*NL*
reinstatement
in
respect
,
to
quit
the
room
,
and
avoid
further
hindrance
*NL*
to
business
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bulstrode
,
after
a
moment
's
hesitation
,
took
his
hat
from
the
floor
and
*NL*
slowly
rose
,
but
he
grasped
the
corner
of
the
chair
so
totteringly
that
*NL*
Lydgate
felt
sure
there
was
not
strength
enough
in
him
to
walk
away
*NL*
without
support
.
What
could
he
do
?
He
could
not
see
a
man
sink
close
*NL*
to
him
for
want
of
help
.
He
rose
and
gave
his
arm
to
Bulstrode
,
and
in
*NL*
that
way
led
him
out
of
the
room
;
yet
this
act
,
which
might
have
been
*NL*
one
of
gentle
duty
and
pure
compassion
,
was
at
this
moment
unspeakably
*NL*
bitter
to
him
.
It
seemed
as
if
he
were
putting
his
sign-manual
to
that
*NL*
association
of
himself
with
Bulstrode
,
of
which
he
now
saw
the
full
*NL*
meaning
as
it
must
have
presented
itself
to
other
minds
.
He
now
felt
*NL*
the
conviction
that
this
man
who
was
leaning
tremblingly
on
his
arm
,
*NL*
had
given
him
the
thousand
pounds
as
a
bribe
,
and
that
somehow
the
*NL*
treatment
of
Raffles
had
been
tampered
with
from
an
evil
motive
.
The
*NL*
inferences
were
closely
linked
enough
;
the
town
knew
of
the
loan
,
*NL*
believed
it
to
be
a
bribe
,
and
believed
that
he
took
it
as
a
bribe
.
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Lydgate
,
his
mind
struggling
under
the
terrible
clutch
of
this
*NL*
revelation
,
was
all
the
while
morally
forced
to
take
Mr.
Bulstrode
to
*NL*
the
Bank
,
send
a
man
off
for
his
carriage
,
and
wait
to
accompany
him
*NL*
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
the
business
of
the
meeting
was
despatched
,
and
fringed
off
*NL*
into
eager
discussion
among
various
groups
concerning
this
affair
of
*NL*
Bulstrode
--
and
Lydgate
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Brooke
,
who
had
before
heard
only
imperfect
hints
of
it
,
and
was
*NL*
very
uneasy
that
he
had
``
gone
a
little
too
far
''
in
countenancing
*NL*
Bulstrode
,
now
got
himself
fully
informed
,
and
felt
some
benevolent
*NL*
sadness
in
talking
to
Mr.
Farebrother
about
the
ugly
light
in
which
*NL*
Lydgate
had
come
to
be
regarded
.
Mr.
Farebrother
was
going
to
walk
*NL*
back
to
Lowick
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Step
into
my
carriage
,
''
said
Mr.
Brooke
.
``
I
am
going
round
to
see
*NL*
Mrs.
Casaubon
.
She
was
to
come
back
from
Yorkshire
last
night
.
She
*NL*
will
like
to
see
me
,
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
they
drove
along
,
Mr.
Brooke
chatting
with
good-natured
hope
that
*NL*
there
had
not
really
been
anything
black
in
Lydgate
's
behavior
--
a
*NL*
young
fellow
whom
he
had
seen
to
be
quite
above
the
common
mark
,
when
*NL*
he
brought
a
letter
from
his
uncle
Sir
Godwin
.
Mr.
Farebrother
said
*NL*
little
:
he
was
deeply
mournful
:
with
a
keen
perception
of
human
*NL*
weakness
,
he
could
not
be
confident
that
under
the
pressure
of
*NL*
humiliating
needs
Lydgate
had
not
fallen
below
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
carriage
drove
up
to
the
gate
of
the
Manor
,
Dorothea
was
out
*NL*
on
the
gravel
,
and
came
to
greet
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
my
dear
,
''
said
Mr.
Brooke
,
``
we
have
just
come
from
a
meeting
--
a
*NL*
sanitary
meeting
,
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
Mr.
Lydgate
there
?
''
said
Dorothea
,
who
looked
full
of
health
and
*NL*
animation
,
and
stood
with
her
head
bare
under
the
gleaming
April
*NL*
lights
.
``
I
want
to
see
him
and
have
a
great
consultation
with
him
*NL*
about
the
Hospital
.
I
have
engaged
with
Mr.
Bulstrode
to
do
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
dear
,
''
said
Mr.
Brooke
,
``
we
have
been
hearing
bad
news
--
bad
*NL*
news
,
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
walked
through
the
garden
towards
the
churchyard
gate
,
Mr.
*NL*
Farebrother
wanting
to
go
on
to
the
parsonage
;
and
Dorothea
heard
the
*NL*
whole
sad
story
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
listened
with
deep
interest
,
and
begged
to
hear
twice
over
the
*NL*
facts
and
impressions
concerning
Lydgate
.
After
a
short
silence
,
*NL*
pausing
at
the
churchyard
gate
,
and
addressing
Mr.
Farebrother
,
she
*NL*
said
energetically
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
believe
that
Mr.
Lydgate
is
guilty
of
anything
base
?
I
will
*NL*
not
believe
it
.
Let
us
find
out
the
truth
and
clear
him
!

Full

An
endless
vista
of
fair
things

,

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
's
impetuous
generosity
,
which
would
have
leaped
at
once
to
the
*NL*
vindication
of
Lydgate
from
the
suspicion
of
having
accepted
money
as
a
*NL*
bribe
,
underwent
a
melancholy
check
when
she
came
to
consider
all
the
*NL*
circumstances
of
the
case
by
the
light
of
Mr.
Farebrother
's
experience
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
delicate
matter
to
touch
,
''
he
said
.
``
How
can
we
begin
to
*NL*
inquire
into
it
?
It
must
be
either
publicly
by
setting
the
magistrate
*NL*
and
coroner
to
work
,
or
privately
by
questioning
Lydgate
.
As
to
the
*NL*
first
proceeding
there
is
no
solid
ground
to
go
upon
,
else
Hawley
would
*NL*
have
adopted
it
;
and
as
to
opening
the
subject
with
Lydgate
,
I
confess
*NL*
I
should
shrink
from
it
.
He
would
probably
take
it
as
a
deadly
insult
.
*NL*
I
have
more
than
once
experienced
the
difficulty
of
speaking
to
him
on
*NL*
personal
matters
.
And
--
one
should
know
the
truth
about
his
conduct
*NL*
beforehand
,
to
feel
very
confident
of
a
good
result
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
feel
convinced
that
his
conduct
has
not
been
guilty
:
I
believe
that
*NL*
people
are
almost
always
better
than
their
neighbors
think
they
are
,
''
*NL*
said
Dorothea
.
Some
of
her
intensest
experience
in
the
last
two
years
*NL*
had
set
her
mind
strongly
in
opposition
to
any
unfavorable
construction
*NL*
of
others
;
and
for
the
first
time
she
felt
rather
discontented
with
Mr.
*NL*
Farebrother
.
She
disliked
this
cautious
weighing
of
consequences
,
*NL*
instead
of
an
ardent
faith
in
efforts
of
justice
and
mercy
,
which
would
*NL*
conquer
by
their
emotional
force
.
Two
days
afterwards
,
he
was
dining
*NL*
at
the
Manor
with
her
uncle
and
the
Chettams
,
and
when
the
dessert
was
*NL*
standing
uneaten
,
the
servants
were
out
of
the
room
,
and
Mr.
Brooke
was
*NL*
nodding
in
a
nap
,
she
returned
to
the
subject
with
renewed
vivacity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Lydgate
would
understand
that
if
his
friends
hear
a
calumny
about
*NL*
him
their
first
wish
must
be
to
justify
him
.
What
do
we
live
for
,
if
*NL*
it
is
not
to
make
life
less
difficult
to
each
other
?
I
can
not
be
*NL*
indifferent
to
the
troubles
of
a
man
who
advised
me
in
_
my
_
trouble
,
*NL*
and
attended
me
in
my
illness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
's
tone
and
manner
were
not
more
energetic
than
they
had
been
*NL*
when
she
was
at
the
head
of
her
uncle
's
table
nearly
three
years
*NL*
before
,
and
her
experience
since
had
given
her
more
right
to
express
a
*NL*
decided
opinion
.
But
Sir
James
Chettam
was
no
longer
the
diffident
and
*NL*
acquiescent
suitor
:
he
was
the
anxious
brother-in-law
,
with
a
devout
*NL*
admiration
for
his
sister
,
but
with
a
constant
alarm
lest
she
should
*NL*
fall
under
some
new
illusion
almost
as
bad
as
marrying
Casaubon
.
He
*NL*
smiled
much
less
;
when
he
said
``
Exactly
''
it
was
more
often
an
*NL*
introduction
to
a
dissentient
opinion
than
in
those
submissive
bachelor
*NL*
days
;
and
Dorothea
found
to
her
surprise
that
she
had
to
resolve
not
to
*NL*
be
afraid
of
him
--
all
the
more
because
he
was
really
her
best
friend
.
*NL*
He
disagreed
with
her
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
Dorothea
,
''
he
said
,
remonstrantly
,
``
you
ca
n't
undertake
to
manage
*NL*
a
man
's
life
for
him
in
that
way
.
Lydgate
must
know
--
at
least
he
will
*NL*
soon
come
to
know
how
he
stands
.
If
he
can
clear
himself
,
he
will
.
He
*NL*
must
act
for
himself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
his
friends
must
wait
till
they
find
an
opportunity
,
''
added
*NL*
Mr.
Farebrother
.
``
It
is
possible
--
I
have
often
felt
so
much
weakness
*NL*
in
myself
that
I
can
conceive
even
a
man
of
honorable
disposition
,
such
*NL*
as
I
have
always
believed
Lydgate
to
be
,
succumbing
to
such
a
*NL*
temptation
as
that
of
accepting
money
which
was
offered
more
or
less
*NL*
indirectly
as
a
bribe
to
insure
his
silence
about
scandalous
facts
long
*NL*
gone
by
.
I
say
,
I
can
conceive
this
,
if
he
were
under
the
pressure
of
*NL*
hard
circumstances
--
if
he
had
been
harassed
as
I
feel
sure
Lydgate
has
*NL*
been
.
I
would
not
believe
anything
worse
of
him
except
under
stringent
*NL*
proof
.
But
there
is
the
terrible
Nemesis
following
on
some
errors
,
*NL*
that
it
is
always
possible
for
those
who
like
it
to
interpret
them
into
*NL*
a
crime
:
there
is
no
proof
in
favor
of
the
man
outside
his
own
*NL*
consciousness
and
assertion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
how
cruel
!
''
said
Dorothea
,
clasping
her
hands
.
``
And
would
you
not
*NL*
like
to
be
the
one
person
who
believed
in
that
man
's
innocence
,
if
the
*NL*
rest
of
the
world
belied
him
?
Besides
,
there
is
a
man
's
character
*NL*
beforehand
to
speak
for
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
my
dear
Mrs.
Casaubon
,
''
said
Mr.
Farebrother
,
smiling
gently
at
*NL*
her
ardor
,
``
character
is
not
cut
in
marble
--
it
is
not
something
solid
*NL*
and
unalterable
.
It
is
something
living
and
changing
,
and
may
become
*NL*
diseased
as
our
bodies
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
it
may
be
rescued
and
healed
,
''
said
Dorothea
``
I
should
not
be
*NL*
afraid
of
asking
Mr.
Lydgate
to
tell
me
the
truth
,
that
I
might
help
*NL*
him
.
Why
should
I
be
afraid
?
Now
that
I
am
not
to
have
the
land
,
*NL*
James
,
I
might
do
as
Mr.
Bulstrode
proposed
,
and
take
his
place
in
*NL*
providing
for
the
Hospital
;
and
I
have
to
consult
Mr.
Lydgate
,
to
know
*NL*
thoroughly
what
are
the
prospects
of
doing
good
by
keeping
up
the
*NL*
present
plans
.
There
is
the
best
opportunity
in
the
world
for
me
to
*NL*
ask
for
his
confidence
;
and
he
would
be
able
to
tell
me
things
which
*NL*
might
make
all
the
circumstances
clear
.
Then
we
would
all
stand
by
him
*NL*
and
bring
him
out
of
his
trouble
.
People
glorify
all
sorts
of
bravery
*NL*
except
the
bravery
they
might
show
on
behalf
of
their
nearest
*NL*
neighbors
.
''
Dorothea
's
eyes
had
a
moist
brightness
in
them
,
and
the
*NL*
changed
tones
of
her
voice
roused
her
uncle
,
who
began
to
listen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
true
that
a
woman
may
venture
on
some
efforts
of
sympathy
which
*NL*
would
hardly
succeed
if
we
men
undertook
them
,
''
said
Mr.
Farebrother
,
*NL*
almost
converted
by
Dorothea
's
ardor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Surely
,
a
woman
is
bound
to
be
cautious
and
listen
to
those
who
know
*NL*
the
world
better
than
she
does
.
''
said
Sir
James
,
with
his
little
*NL*
frown
.
``
Whatever
you
do
in
the
end
,
Dorothea
,
you
should
really
keep
*NL*
back
at
present
,
and
not
volunteer
any
meddling
with
this
Bulstrode
*NL*
business
.
We
do
n't
know
yet
what
may
turn
up
.
You
must
agree
with
*NL*
me
?
''
he
ended
,
looking
at
Mr.
Farebrother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
think
it
would
be
better
to
wait
,
''
said
the
latter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
my
dear
,
''
said
Mr.
Brooke
,
not
quite
knowing
at
what
point
*NL*
the
discussion
had
arrived
,
but
coming
up
to
it
with
a
contribution
*NL*
which
was
generally
appropriate
.
``
It
is
easy
to
go
too
far
,
you
know
.
*NL*
You
must
not
let
your
ideas
run
away
with
you
.
And
as
to
being
in
a
*NL*
hurry
to
put
money
into
schemes
--
it
wo
n't
do
,
you
know
.
Garth
has
*NL*
drawn
me
in
uncommonly
with
repairs
,
draining
,
that
sort
of
thing
:
I
'm
*NL*
uncommonly
out
of
pocket
with
one
thing
or
another
.
I
must
pull
up
.
*NL*
As
for
you
,
Chettam
,
you
are
spending
a
fortune
on
those
oak
fences
*NL*
round
your
demesne
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
,
submitting
uneasily
to
this
discouragement
,
went
with
Celia
*NL*
into
the
library
,
which
was
her
usual
drawing-room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Dodo
,
do
listen
to
what
James
says

said
Celia
,
``
else
you

*NL*
be
getting
into
a
scrape

You
always
did

and
you
always
will

when

you
set
about
doing
as
you

And
I
think
it
is
a
mercy
now
after
*NL*
all
that
you
have
got
James
to
think
for
you
.
He
lets
you
have
your
*NL*
plans
,
only
he
hinders
you
from
being
taken
in
.
And
that
is
the
good
*NL*
of
having
a
brother
instead
of
a
husband
.
A
husband
would
not
let
you
*NL*
have
your
plans

*NL*
*NL*
``
As
if
I
wanted
a

''
said
Dorothea
.
``
I
only
want
not
to
have
my
*NL*
feelings
checked
at
every
turn

Mrs.
Casaubon
was
still
undisciplined
*NL*
enough
to
burst
into
angry
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
really

Dodo

said
Celia
,
with
rather
a
deeper
guttural
than
*NL*
usual
,
``
you
_
are
_
contradictory
:
first
one
thing
and
then
another

You
*NL*
used
to
submit
to
Mr.
Casaubon
quite
shamefully
:
I
think
you
would
have
*NL*
given
up
ever
coming
to
see
me
if
he
had
asked
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
I
submitted
to
him

because
it
was
my
duty
;
it
was
my

feeling

said
Dorothea
,
looking
through
the
prism
of
her
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
why
ca
n't
you
think
it
your
duty
to
submit
a
little
to
what
James
*NL*
wishes

said
Celia
,
with
a
sense
of
stringency
in
her
argument

*NL*
``
Because

Dorothea

laughed
and
forgot
her
tears

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
mean
about
babies

those

explained
Celia

up

CHAPTER
LXXIII
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pity
the
laden
one
;
this
wandering
woe
*NL*
May
visit
you
and
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
Lydgate
had
allayed
Mrs.
Bulstrode
's
anxiety
by
telling
her
that
*NL*
her
husband
had
been
seized
with
faintness
at
the
meeting
,
but
that
he
*NL*
trusted
soon
to
see
him
better
and
would
call
again
the
next
day
,
*NL*
unless
she
sent
for
him
earlier
,
he
went
directly
home
,
got
on
his
*NL*
horse
,
and
rode
three
miles
out
of
the
town
for
the
sake
of
being
out
*NL*
of
reach
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
felt
himself
becoming
violent
and
unreasonable
as
if
raging
under
*NL*
the
pain
of
stings
:
he
was
ready
to
curse
the
day
on
which
he
had
come
*NL*
to
Middlemarch
.
Everything
that
bad
happened
to
him
there
seemed
a
*NL*
mere
preparation
for
this
hateful
fatality
,
which
had
come
as
a
blight
*NL*
on
his
honorable
ambition
,
and
must
make
even
people
who
had
only
*NL*
vulgar
standards
regard
his
reputation
as
irrevocably
damaged
.
In
such
*NL*
moments
a
man
can
hardly
escape
being
unloving
.
Lydgate
thought
of
*NL*
himself
as
the
sufferer
,
and
of
others
as
the
agents
who
had
injured
*NL*
his
lot
.
He
had
meant
everything
to
turn
out
differently
;
and
others
*NL*
had
thrust
themselves
into
his
life
and
thwarted
his
purposes
.
His
*NL*
marriage
seemed
an
unmitigated
calamity
;
and
he
was
afraid
of
going
to
*NL*
Rosamond
before
he
had
vented
himself
in
this
solitary
rage
,
lest
the
*NL*
mere
sight
of
her
should
exasperate
him
and
make
him
behave
*NL*
unwarrantably
.
There
are
episodes
in
most
men
's
lives
in
which
their
*NL*
highest
qualities
can
only
cast
a
deterring
shadow
over
the
objects
*NL*
that
fill
their
inward
vision
:
Lydgate
's
tenderheartedness
was
present
*NL*
just
then
only
as
a
dread
lest
he
should
offend
against
it
,
not
as
an
*NL*
emotion
that
swayed
him
to
tenderness
.
For
he
was
very
miserable
.
*NL*
Only
those
who
know
the
supremacy
of
the
intellectual
life
--
the
life
*NL*
which
has
a
seed
of
ennobling
thought
and
purpose
within
it
--
can
*NL*
understand
the
grief
of
one
who
falls
from
that
serene
activity
into
*NL*
the
absorbing
soul-wasting
struggle
with
worldly
annoyances
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
was
he
to
live
on
without
vindicating
himself
among
people
who
*NL*
suspected
him
of
baseness
?
How
could
he
go
silently
away
from
*NL*
Middlemarch
as
if
he
were
retreating
before
a
just
condemnation
?
And
*NL*
yet
how
was
he
to
set
about
vindicating
himself
?
*NL*
*NL*
For
that
scene
at
the
meeting
,
which
he
had
just
witnessed
,
although
it
*NL*
had
told
him
no
particulars
,
had
been
enough
to
make
his
own
situation
*NL*
thoroughly
clear
to
him
.
Bulstrode
had
been
in
dread
of
scandalous
*NL*
disclosures
on
the
part
of
Raffles
.
Lydgate
could
now
construct
all
*NL*
the
probabilities
of
the
case
.
``
He
was
afraid
of
some
betrayal
in
my
*NL*
hearing
:
all
he
wanted
was
to
bind
me
to
him
by
a
strong
obligation
:
*NL*
that
was
why
he
passed
on
a
sudden
from
hardness
to
liberality
.
And
he
*NL*
may
have
tampered
with
the
patient
--
he
may
have
disobeyed
my
orders
.
I
*NL*
fear
he
did
.
But
whether
he
did
or
not
,
the
world
believes
that
he
*NL*
somehow
or
other
poisoned
the
man
and
that
I
winked
at
the
crime
,
if
I
*NL*
did
n't
help
in
it
.
And
yet
--
and
yet
he
may
not
be
guilty
of
the
last
*NL*
offence
;
and
it
is
just
possible
that
the
change
towards
me
may
have
*NL*
been
a
genuine
relenting
--
the
effect
of
second
thoughts
such
as
he
*NL*
alleged
.
What
we
call
the
`
just
possible
'
is
sometimes
true
and
the
*NL*
thing
we
find
it
easier
to
believe
is
grossly
false
.
In
his
last
*NL*
dealings
with
this
man
Bulstrode
may
have
kept
his
hands
pure
,
in
spite
*NL*
of
my
suspicion
to
the
contrary
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
benumbing
cruelty
in
his
position
.
Even
if
he
renounced
*NL*
every
other
consideration
than
that
of
justifying
himself
--
if
he
met
*NL*
shrugs
,
cold
glances
,
and
avoidance
as
an
accusation
,
and
made
a
public
*NL*
statement
of
all
the
facts
as
he
knew
them
,
who
would
be
convinced
?
It
*NL*
would
be
playing
the
part
of
a
fool
to
offer
his
own
testimony
on
*NL*
behalf
of
himself
,
and
say
,
``
I
did
not
take
the
money
as
a
bribe
.
''
The
*NL*
circumstances
would
always
be
stronger
than
his
assertion
.
And
*NL*
besides
,
to
come
forward
and
tell
everything
about
himself
must
include
*NL*
declarations
about
Bulstrode
which
would
darken
the
suspicions
of
*NL*
others
against
him
.
He
must
tell
that
he
had
not
known
of
Raffles
's
*NL*
existence
when
he
first
mentioned
his
pressing
need
of
money
to
*NL*
Bulstrode
,
and
that
he
took
the
money
innocently
as
a
result
of
that
*NL*
communication
,
not
knowing
that
a
new
motive
for
the
loan
might
have
*NL*
arisen
on
his
being
called
in
to
this
man
.
And
after
all
,
the
*NL*
suspicion
of
Bulstrode
's
motives
might
be
unjust
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
then
came
the
question
whether
he
should
have
acted
in
precisely
*NL*
the
same
way
if
he
had
not
taken
the
money
?
Certainly
,
if
Raffles
had
*NL*
continued
alive
and
susceptible
of
further
treatment
when
he
arrived
,
*NL*
and
he
had
then
imagined
any
disobedience
to
his
orders
on
the
part
of
*NL*
Bulstrode
,
he
would
have
made
a
strict
inquiry
,
and
if
his
conjecture
*NL*
had
been
verified
he
would
have
thrown
up
the
case
,
in
spite
of
his
*NL*
recent
heavy
obligation
.
But
if
he
had
not
received
any
money
--
if
*NL*
Bulstrode
had
never
revoked
his
cold
recommendation
of
bankruptcy
--
would
*NL*
he
,
Lydgate
,
have
abstained
from
all
inquiry
even
on
finding
the
*NL*
man
dead
?
--
would
the
shrinking
from
an
insult
to
Bulstrode
--
would
the
*NL*
dubiousness
of
all
medical
treatment
and
the
argument
that
his
own
*NL*
treatment
would
pass
for
the
wrong
with
most
members
of
his
*NL*
profession
--
have
had
just
the
same
force
or
significance
with
him
?
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
the
uneasy
corner
of
Lydgate
's
consciousness
while
he
was
*NL*
reviewing
the
facts
and
resisting
all
reproach
.
If
he
had
been
*NL*
independent
,
this
matter
of
a
patient
's
treatment
and
the
distinct
rule
*NL*
that
he
must
do
or
see
done
that
which
he
believed
best
for
the
life
*NL*
committed
to
him
,
would
have
been
the
point
on
which
he
would
have
been
*NL*
the
sturdiest
.
As
it
was
,
he
had
rested
in
the
consideration
that
*NL*
disobedience
to
his
orders
,
however
it
might
have
arisen
,
could
not
be
*NL*
considered
a
crime
,
that
in
the
dominant
opinion
obedience
to
his
*NL*
orders
was
just
as
likely
to
be
fatal
,
and
that
the
affair
was
simply
*NL*
one
of
etiquette
.
Whereas
,
again
and
again
,
in
his
time
of
freedom
,
he
*NL*
had
denounced
the
perversion
of
pathological
doubt
into
moral
doubt
and
*NL*
had
said
--
``
the
purest
experiment
in
treatment
may
still
be
*NL*
conscientious
:
my
business
is
to
take
care
of
life
,
and
to
do
the
best
*NL*
I
can
think
of
for
it
.
Science
is
properly
more
scrupulous
than
dogma
.
*NL*
Dogma
gives
a
charter
to
mistake
,
but
the
very
breath
of
science
is
a
*NL*
contest
with
mistake
,
and
must
keep
the
conscience
alive
.
''
Alas
!
the
*NL*
scientific
conscience
had
got
into
the
debasing
company
of
money
*NL*
obligation
and
selfish
respects
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
there
a
medical
man
of
them
all
in
Middlemarch
who
would
question
*NL*
himself
as
I
do
?
''
said
poor
Lydgate
,
with
a
renewed
outburst
of
*NL*
rebellion
against
the
oppression
of
his
lot
.
``
And
yet
they
will
all
*NL*
feel
warranted
in
making
a
wide
space
between
me
and
them
,
as
if
I
were
*NL*
a
leper
!
My
practice
and
my
reputation
are
utterly
damned
--
I
can
see
*NL*
that
.
Even
if
I
could
be
cleared
by
valid
evidence
,
it
would
make
*NL*
little
difference
to
the
blessed
world
here
.
I
have
been
set
down
as
*NL*
tainted
and
should
be
cheapened
to
them
all
the
same
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Already
there
had
been
abundant
signs
which
had
hitherto
puzzled
him
,
*NL*
that
just
when
he
had
been
paying
off
his
debts
and
getting
cheerfully
*NL*
on
his
feet
,
the
townsmen
were
avoiding
him
or
looking
strangely
at
*NL*
him
,
and
in
two
instances
it
came
to
his
knowledge
that
patients
of
his
*NL*
had
called
in
another
practitioner
.
The
reasons
were
too
plain
now
.
*NL*
The
general
black-balling
had
begun
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
wonder
that
in
Lydgate
's
energetic
nature
the
sense
of
a
hopeless
*NL*
misconstruction
easily
turned
into
a
dogged
resistance
.
The
scowl
*NL*
which
occasionally
showed
itself
on
his
square
brow
was
not
a
*NL*
meaningless
accident
.
Already
when
he
was
re-entering
the
town
after
*NL*
that
ride
taken
in
the
first
hours
of
stinging
pain
,
he
was
setting
his
*NL*
mind
on
remaining
in
Middlemarch
in
spite
of
the
worst
that
could
be
*NL*
done
against
him
.
He
would
not
retreat
before
calumny
,
as
if
he
*NL*
submitted
to
it
.
He
would
face
it
to
the
utmost
,
and
no
act
of
his
*NL*
should
show
that
he
was
afraid
.
It
belonged
to
the
generosity
as
well
*NL*
as
defiant
force
of
his
nature
that
he
resolved
not
to
shrink
from
*NL*
showing
to
the
full
his
sense
of
obligation
to
Bulstrode
.
It
was
true
*NL*
that
the
association
with
this
man
had
been
fatal
to
him
--
true
that
if
*NL*
he
had
had
the
thousand
pounds
still
in
his
hands
with
all
his
debts
*NL*
unpaid
he
would
have
returned
the
money
to
Bulstrode
,
and
taken
beggary
*NL*
rather
than
the
rescue
which
had
been
sullied
with
the
suspicion
of
a
*NL*
bribe
-LRB-
for
,
remember
,
he
was
one
of
the
proudest
among
the
sons
of
*NL*
men
-RRB-
--
nevertheless
,
he
would
not
turn
away
from
this
crushed
*NL*
fellow-mortal
whose
aid
he
had
used
,
and
make
a
pitiful
effort
to
get
*NL*
acquittal
for
himself
by
howling
against
another
.
``
I
shall
do
as
I
*NL*
think
right
,
and
explain
to
nobody
.
They
will
try
to
starve
me
out
,
*NL*
but
--
''
he
was
going
on
with
an
obstinate
resolve
,
but
he
was
getting
*NL*
near
home
,
and
the
thought
of
Rosamond
urged
itself
again
into
that
*NL*
chief
place
from
which
it
had
been
thrust
by
the
agonized
struggles
of
*NL*
wounded
honor
and
pride
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
would
Rosamond
take
it
all
?
Here
was
another
weight
of
chain
to
*NL*
drag
,
and
poor
Lydgate
was
in
a
bad
mood
for
bearing
her
dumb
mastery
.
*NL*
He
had
no
impulse
to
tell
her
the
trouble
which
must
soon
be
common
to
*NL*
them
both
.
He
preferred
waiting
for
the
incidental
disclosure
which
*NL*
events
must
soon
bring
about
.

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
In
Middlemarch
a
wife
could
not
long
remain
ignorant
that
the
town
held
*NL*
a
bad
opinion
of
her
husband
.
No
feminine
intimate
might
carry
her
*NL*
friendship
so
far
as
to
make
a
plain
statement
to
the
wife
of
the
*NL*
unpleasant
fact
known
or
believed
about
her
husband
;
but
when
a
woman
*NL*
with
her
thoughts
much
at
leisure
got
them
suddenly
employed
on
*NL*
something
grievously
disadvantageous
to
her
neighbors
,
various
moral
*NL*
impulses
were
called
into
play
which
tended
to
stimulate
utterance
.
*NL*
Candor
was
one
.
To
be
candid
,
in
Middlemarch
phraseology
,
meant
,
to
*NL*
use
an
early
opportunity
of
letting
your
friends
know
that
you
did
not
*NL*
take
a
cheerful
view
of
their
capacity
,
their
conduct
,
or
their
*NL*
position
;
and
a
robust
candor
never
waited
to
be
asked
for
its
opinion
.
*NL*
Then
,
again
,
there
was
the
love
of
truth
--
a
wide
phrase
,
but
meaning
in
*NL*
this
relation
,
a
lively
objection
to
seeing
a
wife
look
happier
than
*NL*
her
husband
's
character
warranted
,
or
manifest
too
much
satisfaction
in
*NL*
her
lot
--
the
poor
thing
should
have
some
hint
given
her
that
if
she
*NL*
knew
the
truth
she
would
have
less
complacency
in
her
bonnet
,
and
in
*NL*
light
dishes
for
a
supper-party
.
Stronger
than
all
,
there
was
the
*NL*
regard
for
a
friend
's
moral
improvement
,
sometimes
called
her
soul
,
*NL*
which
was
likely
to
be
benefited
by
remarks
tending
to
gloom
,
uttered
*NL*
with
the
accompaniment
of
pensive
staring
at
the
furniture
and
a
manner
*NL*
implying
that
the
speaker
would
not
tell
what
was
on
her
mind
,
from
*NL*
regard
to
the
feelings
of
her
hearer
.
On
the
whole
,
one
might
say
that
*NL*
an
ardent
charity
was
at
work
setting
the
virtuous
mind
to
make
a
*NL*
neighbor
unhappy
for
her
good
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
hardly
any
wives
in
Middlemarch
whose
matrimonial
*NL*
misfortunes
would
in
different
ways
be
likely
to
call
forth
more
of
*NL*
this
moral
activity
than
Rosamond
and
her
aunt
Bulstrode
.
Mrs.
*NL*
Bulstrode
was
not
an
object
of
dislike
,
and
had
never
consciously
*NL*
injured
any
human
being
.
Men
had
always
thought
her
a
handsome
*NL*
comfortable
woman
,
and
had
reckoned
it
among
the
signs
of
Bulstrode
's
*NL*
hypocrisy
that
he
had
chosen
a
red-blooded
Vincy
,
instead
of
a
ghastly
*NL*
and
melancholy
person
suited
to
his
low
esteem
for
earthly
pleasure
.
*NL*
When
the
scandal
about
her
husband
was
disclosed
they
remarked
of
*NL*
her
--
``
Ah
,
poor
woman
!
She
's
as
honest
as
the
day
--
_
she
_
never
*NL*
suspected
anything
wrong
in
him
,
you
may
depend
on
it
.
''
Women
,
who
*NL*
were
intimate
with
her
,
talked
together
much
of
``
poor
Harriet
,
''
*NL*
imagined
what
her
feelings
must
be
when
she
came
to
know
everything
,
*NL*
and
conjectured
how
much
she
had
already
come
to
know
.
There
was
no
*NL*
spiteful
disposition
towards
her
;
rather
,
there
was
a
busy
benevolence
*NL*
anxious
to
ascertain
what
it
would
be
well
for
her
to
feel
and
do
under
*NL*
the
circumstances
,
which
of
course
kept
the
imagination
occupied
with
*NL*
her
character
and
history
from
the
times
when
she
was
Harriet
Vincy
*NL*
till
now
.
With
the
review
of
Mrs.
Bulstrode
and
her
position
it
was
*NL*
inevitable
to
associate
Rosamond
,
whose
prospects
were
under
the
same
*NL*
blight
with
her
aunt
's
.
Rosamond
was
more
severely
criticised
and
less
*NL*
pitied
,
though
she
too
,
as
one
of
the
good
old
Vincy
family
who
had
*NL*
always
been
known
in
Middlemarch
,
was
regarded
as
a
victim
to
marriage
*NL*
with
an
interloper
.
The
Vincys
had
their
weaknesses
,
but
then
they
lay
*NL*
on
the
surface
:
there
was
never
anything
bad
to
be
``
found
out
''
*NL*
concerning
them
.
Mrs.
Bulstrode
was
vindicated
from
any
resemblance
to
*NL*
her
husband
.
Harriet
's
faults
were
her
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
has
always
been
showy
,
''
said
Mrs.
Hackbutt
,
making
tea
for
a
small
*NL*
party
,
``
though
she
has
got
into
the
way
of
putting
her
religion
*NL*
forward
,
to
conform
to
her
husband
;
she
has
tried
to
hold
her
head
up
*NL*
above
Middlemarch
by
making
it
known
that
she
invites
clergymen
and
*NL*
heaven-knows-who
from
Riverston
and
those
places
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
can
hardly
blame
her
for
that
,
''
said
Mrs.
Sprague
;
``
because
few
of
*NL*
the
best
people
in
the
town
cared
to
associate
with
Bulstrode
,
and
she
*NL*
must
have
somebody
to
sit
down
at
her
table
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Thesiger
has
always
countenanced
him
,
''
said
Mrs.
Hackbutt
.
``
I
*NL*
think
he
must
be
sorry
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
he
was
never
fond
of
him
in
his
heart
--
that
every
one
knows
,
''
said
*NL*
Mrs.
Tom
Toller
.
``
Mr.
Thesiger
never
goes
into
extremes
.
He
keeps
to
*NL*
the
truth
in
what
is
evangelical
.
It
is
only
clergymen
like
Mr.
Tyke
,
*NL*
who
want
to
use
Dissenting
hymn-books
and
that
low
kind
of
religion
,
*NL*
who
ever
found
Bulstrode
to
their
taste
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
understand
,
Mr.
Tyke
is
in
great
distress
about
him
,
''
said
Mrs.
*NL*
Hackbutt
.
``
And
well
he
may
be
:
they
say
the
Bulstrodes
have
half
kept
*NL*
the
Tyke
family
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
of
course
it
is
a
discredit
to
his
doctrines
,
''
said
Mrs.
Sprague
,
*NL*
who
was
elderly
,
and
old-fashioned
in
her
opinions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
People
will
not
make
a
boast
of
being
methodistical
in
Middlemarch
for
*NL*
a
good
while
to
come

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
we
must
not
set
down
people
's
bad
actions
to
their
religion

*NL*
said
falcon-faced
Mrs.
Plymdale
,
who
had
been
listening
hitherto
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
dear
,
we
are
forgetting

said
Mrs.
Sprague
.
``
We
ought

talking
of
this
before

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sure
I
have
no
reason
to
be
partial

said
Mrs.
Plymdale

coloring
.
``
It
's
true
Mr.

has
always
been
on
good
terms
with

Vincy
was
my

long
before

But
I
have
always
kept
my
own
opinions

told
her
where
she

wrong

Still
,
in
point
of
religion

I
must
say

might
have
done
what
he
has

like
moderation

how
hard
it
will
be
*NL*
for
her
to
go
among
foreigners
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
doctor
says
that
is
what
he
should
recommend
the
Lydgates
to
do
,
''
*NL*
said
Mrs.
Sprague
.
``
He
says
Lydgate
ought
to
have
kept
among
the
*NL*
French
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
would
suit
_
her
_
well
enough
,
I
dare
say
,
''
said
Mrs.
Plymdale
;
*NL*
``
there
is
that
kind
of
lightness
about
her
.
But
she
got
that
from
her
*NL*
mother
;
she
never
got
it
from
her
aunt
Bulstrode
,
who
always
gave
her
*NL*
good
advice
,
and
to
my
knowledge
would
rather
have
had
her
marry
*NL*
elsewhere
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Plymdale
was
in
a
situation
which
caused
her
some
complication
of
*NL*
feeling
.
There
had
been
not
only
her
intimacy
with
Mrs.
Bulstrode
,
but
*NL*
also
a
profitable
business
relation
of
the
great
Plymdale
dyeing
house
*NL*
with
Mr.
Bulstrode
,
which
on
the
one
hand
would
have
inclined
her
to
*NL*
desire
that
the
mildest
view
of
his
character
should
be
the
true
one
,
*NL*
but
on
the
other
,
made
her
the
more
afraid
of
seeming
to
palliate
his
*NL*
culpability
.
Again
,
the
late
alliance
of
her
family
with
the
Tollers
*NL*
had
brought
her
in
connection
with
the
best
circle
,
which
gratified
her
*NL*
in
every
direction
except
in
the
inclination
to
those
serious
views
*NL*
which
she
believed
to
be
the
best
in
another
sense
.
The
sharp
little
*NL*
woman
's
conscience
was
somewhat
troubled
in
the
adjustment
of
these
*NL*
opposing
``
bests
,
''
and
of
her
griefs
and
satisfactions
under
late
*NL*
events
,
which
were
likely
to
humble
those
who
needed
humbling
,
but
also
*NL*
to
fall
heavily
on
her
old
friend
whose
faults
she
would
have
preferred
*NL*
seeing
on
a
background
of
prosperity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Mrs.
Bulstrode
,
meanwhile
,
had
been
no
further
shaken
by
the
*NL*
oncoming
tread
of
calamity
than
in
the
busier
stirring
of
that
secret
*NL*
uneasiness
which
had
always
been
present
in
her
since
the
last
visit
of
*NL*
Raffles
to
The
Shrubs
.
That
the
hateful
man
had
come
ill
to
Stone
*NL*
Court
,
and
that
her
husband
had
chosen
to
remain
there
and
watch
over
*NL*
him
,
she
allowed
to
be
explained
by
the
fact
that
Raffles
had
been
*NL*
employed
and
aided
in
earlier-days
,
and
that
this
made
a
tie
of
*NL*
benevolence
towards
him
in
his
degraded
helplessness
;
and
she
had
been
*NL*
since
then
innocently
cheered
by
her
husband
's
more
hopeful
speech
*NL*
about
his
own
health
and
ability
to
continue
his
attention
to
business
.
*NL*
The
calm
was
disturbed
when
Lydgate
had
brought
him
home
ill
from
the
*NL*
meeting
,
and
in
spite
of
comforting
assurances
during
the
next
few
*NL*
days
,
she
cried
in
private
from
the
conviction
that
her
husband
was
not
*NL*
suffering
from
bodily
illness
merely
,
but
from
something
that
afflicted
*NL*
his
mind
.
He
would
not
allow
her
to
read
to
him
,
and
scarcely
to
sit
*NL*
with
him
,
alleging
nervous
susceptibility
to
sounds
and
movements
;
yet
*NL*
she
suspected
that
in
shutting
himself
up
in
his
private
room
he
wanted
*NL*
to
be
busy
with
his
papers
.
Something
,
she
felt
sure
,
had
happened
.
*NL*
Perhaps
it
was
some
great
loss
of
money
;
and
she
was
kept
in
the
dark
.
*NL*
Not
daring
to
question
her
husband
,
she
said
to
Lydgate
,
on
the
fifth
*NL*
day
after
the
meeting
,
when
she
had
not
left
home
except
to
go
to
*NL*
church
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Lydgate
,
pray
be
open
with
me
:
I
like
to
know
the
truth
.
Has
*NL*
anything
happened
to
Mr.
Bulstrode
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Some
little
nervous
shock
,
''
said
Lydgate
,
evasively
.
He
felt
that
it
*NL*
was
not
for
him
to
make
the
painful
revelation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
brought
it
on
?
''
said
Mrs.
Bulstrode
,
looking
directly
at
him
*NL*
with
her
large
dark
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
often
something
poisonous
in
the
air
of
public
rooms
,
''
said
*NL*
Lydgate
.
``
Strong
men
can
stand
it
,
but
it
tells
on
people
in
*NL*
proportion
to
the
delicacy
of
their
systems
.
It
is
often
impossible
to
*NL*
account
for
the
precise
moment
of
an
attack
--
or
rather
,
to
say
why
the
*NL*
strength
gives
way
at
a
particular
moment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Bulstrode
was
not
satisfied
with
this
answer
.
There
remained
in
*NL*
her
the
belief
that
some
calamity
had
befallen
her
husband
,
of
which
*NL*
she
was
to
be
kept
in
ignorance
;
and
it
was
in
her
nature
strongly
to
*NL*
object
to
such
concealment
.
She
begged
leave
for
her
daughters
to
sit
*NL*
with
their
father
,
and
drove
into
the
town
to
pay
some
visits
,
*NL*
conjecturing
that
if
anything
were
known
to
have
gone
wrong
in
Mr.
*NL*
Bulstrode
's
affairs
,
she
should
see
or
hear
some
sign
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
called
on
Mrs.
Thesiger
,
who
was
not
at
home
,
and
then
drove
to
*NL*
Mrs.
Hackbutt
's
on
the
other
side
of
the
churchyard
.
Mrs.
Hackbutt
saw
*NL*
her
coming
from
an
up-stairs
window
,
and
remembering
her
former
alarm
*NL*
lest
she
should
meet
Mrs.
Bulstrode
,
felt
almost
bound
in
consistency
*NL*
to
send
word
that
she
was
not
at
home
;
but
against
that
,
there
was
a
*NL*
sudden
strong
desire
within
her
for
the
excitement
of
an
interview
in
*NL*
which
she
was
quite
determined
not
to
make
the
slightest
allusion
to
*NL*
what
was
in
her
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hence
Mrs.
Bulstrode
was
shown
into
the
drawing-room
,
and
Mrs.
Hackbutt
*NL*
went
to
her
,
with
more
tightness
of
lip
and
rubbing
of
her
hands
than
*NL*
was
usually
observable
in
her
,
these
being
precautions
adopted
against
*NL*
freedom
of
speech
.
She
was
resolved
not
to
ask
how
Mr.
Bulstrode
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
not
been
anywhere
except
to
church
for
nearly
a
week
,
''
said
*NL*
Mrs.
Bulstrode
,
after
a
few
introductory
remarks
.
``
But
Mr.
Bulstrode
*NL*
was
taken
so
ill
at
the
meeting
on
Thursday
that
I
have
not
liked
to
*NL*
leave
the
house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Hackbutt
rubbed
the
back
of
one
hand
with
the
palm
of
the
other
*NL*
held
against
her
chest
,
and
let
her
eyes
ramble
over
the
pattern
on
the
*NL*
rug
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
Mr.
Hackbutt
at
the
meeting
?
''
persevered
Mrs.
Bulstrode
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
he
was
,
''
said
Mrs.
Hackbutt
,
with
the
same
attitude
.
``
The
land
*NL*
is
to
be
bought
by
subscription
,
I
believe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
hope
that
there
will
be
no
more
cases
of
cholera
to
be
buried
*NL*
in
it
,
''
said
Mrs.
Bulstrode
.
``
It
is
an
awful
visitation
.
But
I
always
*NL*
think
Middlemarch
a
very
healthy
spot
.
I
suppose
it
is
being
used
to
*NL*
it
from
a
child
;
but
I
never
saw
the
town
I
should
like
to
live
at
*NL*
better
,
and
especially
our
end
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sure
I
should
be
glad
that
you
always
should
live
at
Middlemarch
,
*NL*
Mrs.
Bulstrode
,
''
said
Mrs.
Hackbutt
,
with
a
slight
sigh
.
``
Still
,
we
*NL*
must
learn
to
resign
ourselves
,
wherever
our
lot
may
be
cast
.
Though
I
*NL*
am
sure
there
will
always
be
people
in
this
town
who
will
wish
you
*NL*
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Hackbutt
longed
to
say
,
``
if
you
take
my
advice
you
will
part
from
*NL*
your
husband
,
''
but
it
seemed
clear
to
her
that
the
poor
woman
knew
*NL*
nothing
of
the
thunder
ready
to
bolt
on
her
head
,
and
she
herself
could
*NL*
do
no
more
than
prepare
her
a
little
.
Mrs.
Bulstrode
felt
suddenly
*NL*
rather
chill
and
trembling
:
there
was
evidently
something
unusual
*NL*
behind
this
speech
of
Mrs.
Hackbutt
's
;
but
though
she
had
set
out
with
*NL*
the
desire
to
be
fully
informed
,
she
found
herself
unable
now
to
pursue
*NL*
her
brave
purpose
,
and
turning
the
conversation
by
an
inquiry
about
the
*NL*
young
Hackbutts
,
she
soon
took
her
leave
saying
that
she
was
going
to
*NL*
see
Mrs.
Plymdale
.
On
her
way
thither
she
tried
to
imagine
that
there
*NL*
might
have
been
some
unusually
warm
sparring
at
the
meeting
between
Mr.
*NL*
Bulstrode
and
some
of
his
frequent
opponents
--
perhaps
Mr.
Hackbutt
*NL*
might
have
been
one
of
them
.
That
would
account
for
everything
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
when
she
was
in
conversation
with
Mrs.
Plymdale
that
comforting
*NL*
explanation
seemed
no
longer
tenable
.
``
Selina
''
received
her
with
a
*NL*
pathetic
affectionateness
and
a
disposition
to
give
edifying
answers
on
*NL*
the
commonest
topics
,
which
could
hardly
have
reference
to
an
ordinary
*NL*
quarrel
of
which
the
most
important
consequence
was
a
perturbation
of
*NL*
Mr.
Bulstrode
's
health
.
Beforehand
Mrs.
Bulstrode
had
thought
that
she
*NL*
would
sooner
question
Mrs.
Plymdale
than
any
one
else
;
but
she
found
to
*NL*
her
surprise
that
an
old
friend
is
not
always
the
person
whom
it
is
*NL*
easiest
to
make
a
confidant
of
:
there
was
the
barrier
of
remembered
*NL*
communication
under
other
circumstances
--
there
was
the
dislike
of
*NL*
being
pitied
and
informed
by
one
who
had
been
long
wont
to
allow
her
*NL*
the
superiority
.
For
certain
words
of
mysterious
appropriateness
that
*NL*
Mrs.
Plymdale
let
fall
about
her
resolution
never
to
turn
her
back
on
*NL*
her
friends
,
convinced
Mrs.
Bulstrode
that
what
had
happened
must
be
*NL*
some
kind
of
misfortune
,
and
instead
of
being
able
to
say
with
her
*NL*
native
directness
,
``
What
is
it
that
you
have
in
your
mind
?
''
she
found
*NL*
herself
anxious
to
get
away
before
she
had
heard
anything
more
*NL*
explicit
.
She
began
to
have
an
agitating
certainty
that
the
misfortune
*NL*
was
something
more
than
the
mere
loss
of
money
,
being
keenly
sensitive
*NL*
to
the
fact
that
Selina
now
,
just
as
Mrs.
Hackbutt
had
done
before
,
*NL*
avoided
noticing
what
she
said
about
her
husband
,
as
they
would
have
*NL*
avoided
noticing
a
personal
blemish
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
said
good-by
with
nervous
haste
,
and
told
the
coachman
to
drive
to
*NL*
Mr.
Vincy
's
warehouse
.
In
that
short
drive
her
dread
gathered
so
much
*NL*
force
from
the
sense
of
darkness
,
that
when
she
entered
the
private
*NL*
counting-house
where
her
brother
sat
at
his
desk
,
her
knees
trembled
*NL*
and
her
usually
florid
face
was
deathly
pale
.
Something
of
the
same
*NL*
effect
was
produced
in
him
by
the
sight
of
her
:
he
rose
from
his
seat
*NL*
to
meet
her
,
took
her
by
the
hand
,
and
said
,
with
his
impulsive
*NL*
rashness
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
help
you
,
Harriet
!
you
know
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
moment
was
perhaps
worse
than
any
which
came
after
.
It
contained
*NL*
that
concentrated
experience
which
in
great
crises
of
emotion
reveals
*NL*
the
bias
of
a
nature
,
and
is
prophetic
of
the
ultimate
act
which
will
*NL*
end
an
intermediate
struggle
.
Without
that
memory
of
Raffles
she
might
*NL*
still
have
thought
only
of
monetary
ruin
,
but
now
along
with
her
*NL*
brother
's
look
and
words
there
darted
into
her
mind
the
idea
of
some
*NL*
guilt
in
her
husband
--
then
,
under
the
working
of
terror
came
the
image
*NL*
of
her
husband
exposed
to
disgrace
--
and
then
,
after
an
instant
of
*NL*
scorching
shame
in
which
she
felt
only
the
eyes
of
the
world
,
with
one
*NL*
leap
of
her
heart
she
was
at
his
side
in
mournful
but
unreproaching
*NL*
fellowship
with
shame
and
isolation
.
All
this
went
on
within
her
in
a
*NL*
mere
flash
of
time
--
while
she
sank
into
the
chair
,
and
raised
her
eyes
*NL*
to
her
brother
,
who
stood
over
her
.
``
I
know
nothing
,
Walter
.
What
is
*NL*
it
?
''
she
said
,
faintly
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
told
her
everything
,
very
inartificially
,
in
slow
fragments
,
making
*NL*
her
aware
that
the
scandal
went
much
beyond
proof
,
especially
as
to
the
*NL*
end
of
Raffles
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
People
will
talk
,
''
he
said
.
``
Even
if
a
man
has
been
acquitted
by
a
*NL*
jury
,
they
'll
talk
,
and
nod
and
wink
--
and
as
far
as
the
world
goes
,
a
*NL*
man
might
often
as
well
be
guilty
as
not
.
It
's
a
breakdown
blow
,
and
*NL*
it
damages
Lydgate
as
much
as
Bulstrode
.
I
do
n't
pretend
to
say
what
*NL*
is
the
truth
.
I
only
wish
we
had
never
heard
the
name
of
either
*NL*
Bulstrode
or
Lydgate
.
You
'd
better
have
been
a
Vincy
all
your
life
,
*NL*
and
so
had
Rosamond
.
''
Mrs.
Bulstrode
made
no
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
must
bear
up
as
well
as
you
can
,
Harriet
.
People
do
n't
blame
*NL*
_
you
_
.
And
I
'll
stand
by
you
whatever
you
make
up
your
mind
to
do
,
''
*NL*
said
the
brother
,
with
rough
but
well-meaning
affectionateness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
me
your
arm
to
the
carriage
,
Walter
,
''
said
Mrs.
Bulstrode
.
``
I
*NL*
feel
very
weak
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
when
she
got
home
she
was
obliged
to
say
to
her
daughter
,
``
I
am
not
*NL*
well
,
my
dear
;
I
must
go
and
lie
down
.
Attend
to
your
papa
.
Leave
me
*NL*
in
quiet
.
I
shall
take
no
dinner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
locked
herself
in
her
room
.
She
needed
time
to
get
used
to
her
*NL*
maimed
consciousness
,
her
poor
lopped
life
,
before
she
could
walk
*NL*
steadily
to
the
place
allotted
her
.
A
new
searching
light
had
fallen
*NL*
on
her
husband
's
character
,
and
she
could
not
judge
him
leniently
:
the
*NL*
twenty
years
in
which
she
had
believed
in
him
and
venerated
him
by
*NL*
virtue
of
his
concealments
came
back
with
particulars
that
made
them
*NL*
seem
an
odious
deceit
.
He
had
married
her
with
that
bad
past
life
*NL*
hidden
behind
him
,
and
she
had
no
faith
left
to
protest
his
innocence
*NL*
of
the
worst
that
was
imputed
to
him
.
Her
honest
ostentatious
nature
*NL*
made
the
sharing
of
a
merited
dishonor
as
bitter
as
it
could
be
to
any
*NL*
mortal
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
this
imperfectly
taught
woman
,
whose
phrases
and
habits
were
an
odd
*NL*
patchwork
,
had
a
loyal
spirit
within
her
.
The
man
whose
prosperity
she
*NL*
had
shared
through
nearly
half
a
life
,
and
who
had
unvaryingly
*NL*
cherished
her
--
now
that
punishment
had
befallen
him
it
was
not
possible
*NL*
to
her
in
any
sense
to
forsake
him
.
There
is
a
forsaking
which
still
*NL*
sits
at
the
same
board
and
lies
on
the
same
couch
with
the
forsaken
*NL*
soul
,
withering
it
the
more
by
unloving
proximity
.
She
knew
,
when
she
*NL*
locked
her
door
,
that
she
should
unlock
it
ready
to
go
down
to
her
*NL*
unhappy
husband
and
espouse
his
sorrow
,
and
say
of
his
guilt
,
I
will
*NL*
mourn
and
not
reproach
.
But
she
needed
time
to
gather
up
her
strength
;
*NL*
she
needed
to
sob
out
her
farewell
to
all
the
gladness
and
pride
of
her
*NL*
life
.
When
she
had
resolved
to
go
down
,
she
prepared
herself
by
some
*NL*
little
acts
which
might
seem
mere
folly
to
a
hard
onlooker
;
they
were
*NL*
her
way
of
expressing
to
all
spectators
visible
or
invisible
that
she
*NL*
had
begun
a
new
life
in
which
she
embraced
humiliation
.
She
took
off
*NL*
all
her
ornaments
and
put
on
a
plain
black
gown
,
and
instead
of
wearing
*NL*
her
much-adorned
cap
and
large
bows
of
hair
,
she
brushed
her
hair
down
*NL*
and
put
on
a
plain
bonnet-cap
,
which
made
her
look
suddenly
like
an
*NL*
early
Methodist
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bulstrode
,
who
knew
that
his
wife
had
been
out
and
had
come
in
saying
*NL*
that
she
was
not
well
,
had
spent
the
time
in
an
agitation
equal
to
*NL*
hers
.
He
had
looked
forward
to
her
learning
the
truth
from
others
,
and
*NL*
had
acquiesced
in
that
probability
,
as
something
easier
to
him
than
any
*NL*
confession
.
But
now
that
he
imagined
the
moment
of
her
knowledge
come
,
*NL*
he
awaited
the
result
in
anguish
.
His
daughters
had
been
obliged
to
*NL*
consent
to
leave
him
,
and
though
he
had
allowed
some
food
to
be
brought
*NL*
to
him
,
he
had
not
touched
it
.
He
felt
himself
perishing
slowly
in
*NL*
unpitied
misery
.
Perhaps
he
should
never
see
his
wife
's
face
with
*NL*
affection
in
it
again
.
And
if
he
turned
to
God
there
seemed
to
be
no
*NL*
answer
but
the
pressure
of
retribution
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
eight
o'clock
in
the
evening
before
the
door
opened
and
his
wife
*NL*
entered
.
He
dared
not
look
up
at
her
.
He
sat
with
his
eyes
bent
down
,
*NL*
and
as
she
went
towards
him
she
thought
he
looked
smaller
--
he
seemed
*NL*
so
withered
and
shrunken
.
A
movement
of
new
compassion
and
old
*NL*
tenderness
went
through
her
like
a
great
wave
,
and
putting
one
hand
on
*NL*
his
which
rested
on
the
arm
of
the
chair
,
and
the
other
on
his
*NL*
shoulder
,
she
said
,
solemnly
but
kindly
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
up
,
Nicholas
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
raised
his
eyes
with
a
little
start
and
looked
at
her
half
amazed
*NL*
for
a
moment
:
her
pale
face
,
her
changed
,
mourning
dress
,
the
trembling
*NL*
about
her
mouth
,
all
said
,
``
I
know
;
''
and
her
hands
and
eyes
rested
*NL*
gently
on
him
.
He
burst
out
crying
and
they
cried
together
,
she
*NL*
sitting
at
his
side
.
They
could
not
yet
speak
to
each
other
of
the
*NL*
shame
which
she
was
bearing
with
him
,
or
of
the
acts
which
had
brought
*NL*
it
down
on
them
.
His
confession
was
silent
,
and
her
promise
of
*NL*
faithfulness
was
silent
.
Open-minded
as
she
was
,
she
nevertheless
*NL*
shrank
from
the
words
which
would
have
expressed
their
mutual
*NL*
consciousness
,
as
she
would
have
shrunk
from
flakes
of
fire
.
She
could
*NL*
not
say
,
``
How
much
is
only
slander
and
false
suspicion
?
''
and
he
did
not
*NL*
say
,
``
I
am
innocent
.

PASCAL
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Rosamond
had
a
gleam
of
returning
cheerfulness
when
the
house
was
freed
*NL*
from
the
threatening
figure
,
and
when
all
the
disagreeable
creditors
*NL*
were
paid
.
But
she
was
not
joyous
:
her
married
life
had
fulfilled
none
*NL*
of
her
hopes
,
and
had
been
quite
spoiled
for
her
imagination
.
In
this
*NL*
brief
interval
of
calm
,
Lydgate
,
remembering
that
he
had
often
been
*NL*
stormy
in
his
hours
of
perturbation
,
and
mindful
of
the
pain
Rosamond
*NL*
had
had
to
bear
,
was
carefully
gentle
towards
her
;
but
he
,
too
,
had
*NL*
lost
some
of
his
old
spirit
,
and
he
still
felt
it
necessary
to
refer
to
*NL*
an
economical
change
in
their
way
of
living
as
a
matter
of
course
,
*NL*
trying
to
reconcile
her
to
it
gradually
,
and
repressing
his
anger
when
*NL*
she
answered
by
wishing
that
he
would
go
to
live
in
London
.
When
she
*NL*
did
not
make
this
answer
,
she
listened
languidly
,
and
wondered
what
she
*NL*
had
that
was
worth
living
for
.
The
hard
and
contemptuous
words
which
*NL*
had
fallen
from
her
husband
in
his
anger
had
deeply
offended
that
*NL*
vanity
which
he
had
at
first
called
into
active
enjoyment
;
and
what
she
*NL*
regarded
as
his
perverse
way
of
looking
at
things
,
kept
up
a
secret
*NL*
repulsion
,
which
made
her
receive
all
his
tenderness
as
a
poor
*NL*
substitute
for
the
happiness
he
had
failed
to
give
her
.
They
were
at
a
*NL*
disadvantage
with
their
neighbors
,
and
there
was
no
longer
any
outlook
*NL*
towards
Quallingham
--
there
was
no
outlook
anywhere
except
in
an
*NL*
occasional
letter
from
Will
Ladislaw
.
She
had
felt
stung
and
*NL*
disappointed
by
Will
's
resolution
to
quit
Middlemarch
,
for
in
spite
of
*NL*
what
she
knew
and
guessed
about
his
admiration
for
Dorothea
,
she
*NL*
secretly
cherished
the
belief
that
he
had
,
or
would
necessarily
come
to
*NL*
have
,
much
more
admiration
for
herself
;
Rosamond
being
one
of
those
*NL*
women
who
live
much
in
the
idea
that
each
man
they
meet
would
have
*NL*
preferred
them
if
the
preference
had
not
been
hopeless
.
Mrs.
Casaubon
*NL*
was
all
very
well
;
but
Will
's
interest
in
her
dated
before
he
knew
Mrs.
*NL*
Lydgate
.
Rosamond
took
his
way
of
talking
to
herself
,
which
was
a
*NL*
mixture
of
playful
fault-finding
and
hyperbolical
gallantry
,
as
the
*NL*
disguise
of
a
deeper
feeling
;
and
in
his
presence
she
felt
that
*NL*
agreeable
titillation
of
vanity
and
sense
of
romantic
drama
which
*NL*
Lydgate
's
presence
had
no
longer
the
magic
to
create
.
She
even
*NL*
fancied
--
what
will
not
men
and
women
fancy
in
these
matters
?
--
that
*NL*
Will
exaggerated
his
admiration
for
Mrs.
Casaubon
in
order
to
pique
*NL*
herself
.
In
this
way
poor
Rosamond
's
brain
had
been
busy
before
Will
's
*NL*
departure
.
He
would
have
made
,
she
thought
,
a
much
more
suitable
*NL*
husband
for
her
than
she
had
found
in
Lydgate
.
No
notion
could
have
*NL*
been
falser
than
this
,
for
Rosamond
's
discontent
in
her
marriage
was
*NL*
due
to
the
conditions
of
marriage
itself
,
to
its
demand
for
*NL*
self-suppression
and
tolerance
,
and
not
to
the
nature
of
her
husband
;
*NL*
but
the
easy
conception
of
an
unreal
Better
had
a
sentimental
charm
*NL*
which
diverted
her
ennui
.
She
constructed
a
little
romance
which
was
*NL*
to
vary
the
flatness
of
her
life
:
Will
Ladislaw
was
always
to
be
a
*NL*
bachelor
and
live
near
her
,
always
to
be
at
her
command
,
and
have
an
*NL*
understood
though
never
fully
expressed
passion
for
her
,
which
would
be
*NL*
sending
out
lambent
flames
every
now
and
then
in
interesting
scenes
.
*NL*
His
departure
had
been
a
proportionate
disappointment
,
and
had
sadly
*NL*
increased
her
weariness
of
Middlemarch
;
but
at
first
she
had
the
*NL*
alternative
dream
of
pleasures
in
store
from
her
intercourse
with
the
*NL*
family
at
Quallingham
.
Since
then
the
troubles
of
her
married
life
had
*NL*
deepened
,
and
the
absence
of
other
relief
encouraged
her
regretful
*NL*
rumination
over
that
thin
romance
which
she
had
once
fed
on
.
Men
and
*NL*
women
make
sad
mistakes
about
their
own
symptoms
,
taking
their
vague
*NL*
uneasy
longings
,
sometimes
for
genius
,
sometimes
for
religion
,
and
*NL*
oftener
still
for
a
mighty
love
.
Will
Ladislaw
had
written
chatty
*NL*
letters
,
half
to
her
and
half
to
Lydgate
,
and
she
had
replied
:
their
*NL*
separation
,
she
felt
,
was
not
likely
to
be
final
,
and
the
change
she
*NL*
now
most
longed
for
was
that
Lydgate
should
go
to
live
in
London
;
*NL*
everything
would
be
agreeable
in
London
;
and
she
had
set
to
work
with
*NL*
quiet
determination
to
win
this
result
,
when
there
came
a
sudden
,
*NL*
delightful
promise
which
inspirited
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
came
shortly
before
the
memorable
meeting
at
the
town-hall
,
and
was
*NL*
nothing
less
than
a
letter
from
Will
Ladislaw
to
Lydgate
,
which
turned
*NL*
indeed
chiefly
on
his
new
interest
in
plans
of
colonization
,
but
*NL*
mentioned
incidentally
,
that
he
might
find
it
necessary
to
pay
a
visit
*NL*
to
Middlemarch
within
the
next
few
weeks
--
a
very
pleasant
necessity
,
he
*NL*
said
,
almost
as
good
as
holidays
to
a
schoolboy
.
He
hoped
there
was
*NL*
his
old
place
on
the
rug
,
and
a
great
deal
of
music
in
store
for
him
.
*NL*
But
he
was
quite
uncertain
as
to
the
time
.
While
Lydgate
was
reading
*NL*
the
letter
to
Rosamond
,
her
face
looked
like
a
reviving
flower
--
it
grew
*NL*
prettier
and
more
blooming
.
There
was
nothing
unendurable
now
:
the
*NL*
debts
were
paid
,
Mr.
Ladislaw
was
coming
,
and
Lydgate
would
be
*NL*
persuaded
to
leave
Middlemarch
and
settle
in
London
,
which
was
``
so
*NL*
different
from
a
provincial
town
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
a
bright
bit
of
morning
.
But
soon
the
sky
became
black
over
*NL*
poor
Rosamond
.
The
presence
of
a
new
gloom
in
her
husband
,
about
which
*NL*
he
was
entirely
reserved
towards
her
--
for
he
dreaded
to
expose
his
*NL*
lacerated
feeling
to
her
neutrality
and
misconception
--
soon
received
a
*NL*
painfully
strange
explanation
,
alien
to
all
her
previous
notions
of
*NL*
what
could
affect
her
happiness
.
In
the
new
gayety
of
her
spirits
,
*NL*
thinking
that
Lydgate
had
merely
a
worse
fit
of
moodiness
than
usual
,
*NL*
causing
him
to
leave
her
remarks
unanswered
,
and
evidently
to
keep
out
*NL*
of
her
way
as
much
as
possible
,
she
chose
,
a
few
days
after
the
*NL*
meeting
,
and
without
speaking
to
him
on
the
subject
,
to
send
out
notes
*NL*
of
invitation
for
a
small
evening
party
,
feeling
convinced
that
this
*NL*
was
a
judicious
step
,
since
people
seemed
to
have
been
keeping
aloof
*NL*
from
them
,
and
wanted
restoring
to
the
old
habit
of
intercourse
.
When
*NL*
the
invitations
had
been
accepted
,
she
would
tell
Lydgate
,
and
give
him
*NL*
a
wise
admonition
as
to
how
a
medical
man
should
behave
to
his
*NL*
neighbors
;
for
Rosamond
had
the
gravest
little
airs
possible
about
*NL*
other
people
's
duties
.
But
all
the
invitations
were
declined
,
and
the
*NL*
last
answer
came
into
Lydgate
's
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
Chichely
's
scratch
.
What
is
he
writing
to
you
about
?
''
said
*NL*
Lydgate
,
wonderingly
,
as
he
handed
the
note
to
her
.
She
was
obliged
to
*NL*
let
him
see
it
,
and
,
looking
at
her
severely
,
he
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
on
earth
have
you
been
sending
out
invitations
without
telling
me
,
*NL*
Rosamond
?
I
beg
,
I
insist
that
you
will
not
invite
any
one
to
this
*NL*
house
.
I
suppose
you
have
been
inviting
others
,
and
they
have
refused
*NL*
too
.
''
She
said
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
hear
me
?
''
thundered
Lydgate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
certainly
I
hear
you
,
''
said
Rosamond
,
turning
her
head
aside
with
*NL*
the
movement
of
a
graceful
long-necked
bird
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lydgate
tossed
his
head
without
any
grace
and
walked
out
of
the
room
,
*NL*
feeling
himself
dangerous
.
Rosamond
's
thought
was
,
that
he
was
getting
*NL*
more
and
more
unbearable
--
not
that
there
was
any
new
special
reason
for
*NL*
this
peremptoriness
.
His
indisposition
to
tell
her
anything
in
which
*NL*
he
was
sure
beforehand
that
she
would
not
be
interested
was
growing
*NL*
into
an
unreflecting
habit
,
and
she
was
in
ignorance
of
everything
*NL*
connected
with
the
thousand
pounds
except
that
the
loan
had
come
from
*NL*
her
uncle
Bulstrode
.
Lydgate
's
odious
humors
and
their
neighbors
'
*NL*
apparent
avoidance
of
them
had
an
unaccountable
date
for
her
in
their
*NL*
relief
from
money
difficulties
.
If
the
invitations
had
been
accepted
*NL*
she
would
have
gone
to
invite
her
mamma
and
the
rest
,
whom
she
had
seen
*NL*
nothing
of
for
several
days
;
and
she
now
put
on
her
bonnet
to
go
and
*NL*
inquire
what
had
become
of
them
all
,
suddenly
feeling
as
if
there
were
*NL*
a
conspiracy
to
leave
her
in
isolation
with
a
husband
disposed
to
*NL*
offend
everybody
.
It
was
after
the
dinner
hour
,
and
she
found
her
*NL*
father
and
mother
seated
together
alone
in
the
drawing-room
.
They
*NL*
greeted
her
with
sad
looks
,
saying
``
Well
,
my
dear
!
''
and
no
more
.
She
*NL*
had
never
seen
her
father
look
so
downcast
;
and
seating
herself
near
*NL*
him
she
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
there
anything
the
matter
,
papa
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
answer
,
but
Mrs.
Vincy
said
,
``
Oh
,
my
dear
,
have
you
heard
*NL*
nothing
?
It
wo
n't
be
long
before
it
reaches
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
anything
about
Tertius
?
''
said
Rosamond
,
turning
pale
.
The
idea
*NL*
of
trouble
immediately
connected
itself
with
what
had
been
*NL*
unaccountable
to
her
in
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
dear
,
yes
.
To
think
of
your
marrying
into
this
trouble
.
Debt
*NL*
was
bad
enough
,
but
this
will
be
worse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stay
,
stay
,
Lucy
,
''
said
Mr.
Vincy
.
``
Have
you
heard
nothing
about
your
*NL*
uncle
Bulstrode
,
Rosamond
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
papa
,
''
said
the
poor
thing
,
feeling
as
if
trouble
were
not
*NL*
anything
she
had
before
experienced
,
but
some
invisible
power
with
an
*NL*
iron
grasp
that
made
her
soul
faint
within
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
father
told
her
everything
,
saying
at
the
end
,
``
It
's
better
for
you
*NL*
to
know
,
my
dear
.
I
think
Lydgate
must
leave
the
town
.
Things
have
*NL*
gone
against
him
.
I
dare
say
he
could
n't
help
it
.
I
do
n't
accuse
him
*NL*
of
any
harm
,
''
said
Mr.
Vincy
.
He
had
always
before
been
disposed
to
*NL*
find
the
utmost
fault
with
Lydgate
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
shock
to
Rosamond
was
terrible
.
It
seemed
to
her
that
no
lot
could
*NL*
be
so
cruelly
hard
as
hers
to
have
married
a
man
who
had
become
the
*NL*
centre
of
infamous
suspicions
.
In
many
cases
it
is
inevitable
that
the
*NL*
shame
is
felt
to
be
the
worst
part
of
crime
;
and
it
would
have
required
*NL*
a
great
deal
of
disentangling
reflection
,
such
as
had
never
entered
*NL*
into
Rosamond
's
life
,
for
her
in
these
moments
to
feel
that
her
trouble
*NL*
was
less
than
if
her
husband
had
been
certainly
known
to
have
done
*NL*
something
criminal
.
All
the
shame
seemed
to
be
there
.
And
she
had
*NL*
innocently
married
this
man
with
the
belief
that
he
and
his
family
were
*NL*
a
glory
to
her
!
She
showed
her
usual
reticence
to
her
parents
,
and
*NL*
only
said
,
that
if
Lydgate
had
done
as
she
wished
he
would
have
left
*NL*
Middlemarch
long
ago
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
bears
it
beyond
anything
,
''
said
her
mother
when
she
was
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
thank
God
!
''
said
Mr.
Vincy
,
who
was
much
broken
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Rosamond
went
home
with
a
sense
of
justified
repugnance
towards
her
*NL*
husband
.
What
had
he
really
done
--
how
had
he
really
acted
?
She
did
*NL*
not
know
.
Why
had
he
not
told
her
everything
?
He
did
not
speak
to
her
*NL*
on
the
subject
,
and
of
course
she
could
not
speak
to
him
.
It
came
into
*NL*
her
mind
once
that
she
would
ask
her
father
to
let
her
go
home
again
;
*NL*
but
dwelling
on
that
prospect
made
it
seem
utter
dreariness
to
her
:
a
*NL*
married
woman
gone
back
to
live
with
her
parents
--
life
seemed
to
have
*NL*
no
meaning
for
her
in
such
a
position
:
she
could
not
contemplate
*NL*
herself
in
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
two
days
Lydgate
observed
a
change
in
her
,
and
believed
that
*NL*
she
had
heard
the
bad
news
.
Would
she
speak
to
him
about
it
,
or
would
*NL*
she
go
on
forever
in
the
silence
which
seemed
to
imply
that
she
*NL*
believed
him
guilty
?
We
must
remember
that
he
was
in
a
morbid
state
of
*NL*
mind
,
in
which
almost
all
contact
was
pain
.
Certainly
Rosamond
in
this
*NL*
case
had
equal
reason
to
complain
of
reserve
and
want
of
confidence
on
*NL*
his
part
;
but
in
the
bitterness
of
his
soul
he
excused
himself
;
--
was
*NL*
he
not
justified
in
shrinking
from
the
task
of
telling
her
,
since
now
*NL*
she
knew
the
truth
she
had
no
impulse
to
speak
to
him
?
But
a
*NL*
deeper-lying
consciousness
that
he
was
in
fault
made
him
restless
,
and
*NL*
the
silence
between
them
became
intolerable
to
him
;
it
was
as
if
they
*NL*
were
both
adrift
on
one
piece
of
wreck
and
looked
away
from
each
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
thought
,
``
I
am
a
fool
.
Have
n't
I
given
up
expecting
anything
?
I
*NL*
have
married
care
,
not
help
.
''
And
that
evening
he
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rosamond
,
have
you
heard
anything
that
distresses
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
she
answered
,
laying
down
her
work
,
which
she
had
been
carrying
*NL*
on
with
a
languid
semi-consciousness
,
most
unlike
her
usual
self
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
have
you
heard
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Everything
,
I
suppose
.
Papa
told
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
people
think
me
disgraced
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Rosamond
,
faintly
,
beginning
to
sew
again
automatically
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
silence
.
Lydgate
thought
,
``
If
she
has
any
trust
in
me
--
any
*NL*
notion
of
what
I
am
,
she
ought
to
speak
now
and
say
that
she
does
not
*NL*
believe
I
have
deserved
disgrace
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Rosamond
on
her
side
went
on
moving
her
fingers
languidly
.
*NL*
Whatever
was
to
be
said
on
the
subject
she
expected
to
come
from
*NL*
Tertius
.
What
did
she
know
?
And
if
he
were
innocent
of
any
wrong
,
why
*NL*
did
he
not
do
something
to
clear
himself
?
*NL*
*NL*
This
silence
of
hers
brought
a
new
rush
of
gall
to
that
bitter
mood
in
*NL*
which
Lydgate
had
been
saying
to
himself
that
nobody
believed
in
*NL*
him
--
even
Farebrother
had
not
come
forward
.
He
had
begun
to
question
*NL*
her
with
the
intent
that
their
conversation
should
disperse
the
chill
*NL*
fog
which
had
gathered
between
them
,
but
he
felt
his
resolution
checked
*NL*
by
despairing
resentment
.
Even
this
trouble
,
like
the
rest
,
she
seemed
*NL*
to
regard
as
if
it
were
hers
alone
.
He
was
always
to
her
a
being
*NL*
apart
,
doing
what
she
objected
to
.
He
started
from
his
chair
with
an
*NL*
angry
impulse
,
and
thrusting
his
hands
in
his
pockets
,
walked
up
and
*NL*
down
the
room
.
There
was
an
underlying
consciousness
all
the
while
*NL*
that
he
should
have
to
master
this
anger
,
and
tell
her
everything
,
and
*NL*
convince
her
of
the
facts
.
For
he
had
almost
learned
the
lesson
that
*NL*
he
must
bend
himself
to
her
nature
,
and
that
because
she
came
short
in
*NL*
her
sympathy
,
he
must
give
the
more
.
Soon
he
recurred
to
his
intention
*NL*
of
opening
himself
:
the
occasion
must
not
be
lost
.
If
he
could
bring
*NL*
her
to
feel
with
some
solemnity
that
here
was
a
slander
which
must
be
*NL*
met
and
not
run
away
from
,
and
that
the
whole
trouble
had
come
out
of
*NL*
his
desperate
want
of
money
,
it
would
be
a
moment
for
urging
powerfully
*NL*
on
her
that
they
should
be
one
in
the
resolve
to
do
with
as
little
*NL*
money
as
possible
,
so
that
they
might
weather
the
bad
time
and
keep
*NL*
themselves
independent
.
He
would
mention
the
definite
measures
which
*NL*
he
desired
to
take
,
and
win
her
to
a
willing
spirit
.
He
was
bound
to
*NL*
try
this
--
and
what
else
was
there
for
him
to
do
?
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
know
how
long
he
had
been
walking
uneasily
backwards
and
*NL*
forwards
,
but
Rosamond
felt
that
it
was
long
,
and
wished
that
he
would
*NL*
sit
down
.
She
too
had
begun
to
think
this
an
opportunity
for
urging
on
*NL*
Tertius
what
he
ought
to
do
.
Whatever
might
be
the
truth
about
all
*NL*
this
misery
,
there
was
one
dread
which
asserted
itself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lydgate
at
last
seated
himself
,
not
in
his
usual
chair
,
but
in
one
*NL*
nearer
to
Rosamond
,
leaning
aside
in
it
towards
her
,
and
looking
at
her
*NL*
gravely
before
he
reopened
the
sad
subject
.
He
had
conquered
himself
*NL*
so
far
,
and
was
about
to
speak
with
a
sense
of
solemnity
,
as
on
an
*NL*
occasion
which
was
not
to
be
repeated
.
He
had
even
opened
his
lips
,
*NL*
when
Rosamond
,
letting
her
hands
fall
,
looked
at
him
and
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Surely
,
Tertius
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Surely
now
at
last
you
have
given
up
the
idea
of
staying
in
*NL*
Middlemarch
.
I
can
not
go
on
living
here
.
Let
us
go
to
London
.
Papa
,
*NL*
and
every
one
else
,
says
you
had
better
go
.
Whatever
misery
I
have
to
*NL*
put
up
with
,
it
will
be
easier
away
from
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lydgate
felt
miserably
jarred
.
Instead
of
that
critical
outpouring
for
*NL*
which
he
had
prepared
himself
with
effort
,
here
was
the
old
round
to
be
*NL*
gone
through
again
.
He
could
not
bear
it
.
With
a
quick
change
of
*NL*
countenance
he
rose
and
went
out
of
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Perhaps
if
he
had
been
strong
enough
to
persist
in
his
determination
to
*NL*
be
the
more
because
she
was
less
,
that
evening
might
have
had
a
better
*NL*
issue
.
If
his
energy
could
have
borne
down
that
check
,
he
might
still
*NL*
have
wrought
on
Rosamond
's
vision
and
will
.
We
can
not
be
sure
that
any
*NL*
natures
,
however
inflexible
or
peculiar
,
will
resist
this
effect
from
a
*NL*
more
massive
being
than
their
own
.
They
may
be
taken
by
storm
and
for
*NL*
the
moment
converted
,
becoming
part
of
the
soul
which
enwraps
them
in
*NL*
the
ardor
of
its
movement
.
But
poor
Lydgate
had
a
throbbing
pain
*NL*
within
him
,
and
his
energy
had
fallen
short
of
its
task
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
beginning
of
mutual
understanding
and
resolve
seemed
as
far
off
as
*NL*
ever
;
nay
,
it
seemed
blocked
out
by
the
sense
of
unsuccessful
effort
.
*NL*
They
lived
on
from
day
to
day
with
their
thoughts
still
apart
,
Lydgate
*NL*
going
about
what
work
he
had
in
a
mood
of
despair
,
and
Rosamond
*NL*
feeling
,
with
some
justification
,
that
he
was
behaving
cruelly
.
It
was
*NL*
of
no
use
to
say
anything
to
Tertius
;
but
when
Will
Ladislaw
came
,
she
*NL*
was
determined
to
tell
him
everything
.
In
spite
of
her
general
*NL*
reticence
,
she
needed
some
one
who
would
recognize
her
wrongs
.

Songs

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Some
days
later
,
Lydgate
was
riding
to
Lowick
Manor
,
in
consequence
of
*NL*
a
summons
from
Dorothea
.
The
summons
had
not
been
unexpected
,
since
it
*NL*
had
followed
a
letter
from
Mr.
Bulstrode
,
in
which
he
stated
that
he
*NL*
had
resumed
his
arrangements
for
quitting
Middlemarch
,
and
must
remind
*NL*
Lydgate
of
his
previous
communications
about
the
Hospital
,
to
the
*NL*
purport
of
which
he
still
adhered
.
It
had
been
his
duty
,
before
taking
*NL*
further
steps
,
to
reopen
the
subject
with
Mrs.
Casaubon
,
who
now
*NL*
wished
,
as
before
,
to
discuss
the
question
with
Lydgate
.
``
Your
views
*NL*
may
possibly
have
undergone
some
change
,
''
wrote
Mr.
Bulstrode
;
``
but
,
in
*NL*
that
case
also
,
it
is
desirable
that
you
should
lay
them
before
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
awaited
his
arrival
with
eager
interest
.
Though
,
in
deference
*NL*
to
her
masculine
advisers
,
she
had
refrained
from
what
Sir
James
had
*NL*
called
``
interfering
in
this
Bulstrode
business
,
''
the
hardship
of
*NL*
Lydgate
's
position
was
continually
in
her
mind
,
and
when
Bulstrode
*NL*
applied
to
her
again
about
the
hospital
,
she
felt
that
the
opportunity
*NL*
was
come
to
her
which
she
had
been
hindered
from
hastening
.
In
her
*NL*
luxurious
home
,
wandering
under
the
boughs
of
her
own
great
trees
,
her
*NL*
thought
was
going
out
over
the
lot
of
others
,
and
her
emotions
were
*NL*
imprisoned
.
The
idea
of
some
active
good
within
her
reach
,
``
haunted
*NL*
her
like
a
passion
,
''
and
another
's
need
having
once
come
to
her
as
a
*NL*
distinct
image
,
preoccupied
her
desire
with
the
yearning
to
give
*NL*
relief
,
and
made
her
own
ease
tasteless
.
She
was
full
of
confident
*NL*
hope
about
this
interview
with
Lydgate
,
never
heeding
what
was
said
of
*NL*
his
personal
reserve
;
never
heeding
that
she
was
a
very
young
woman
.
*NL*
Nothing
could
have
seemed
more
irrelevant
to
Dorothea
than
insistence
*NL*
on
her
youth
and
sex
when
she
was
moved
to
show
her
human
fellowship
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
sat
waiting
in
the
library
,
she
could
do
nothing
but
live
*NL*
through
again
all
the
past
scenes
which
had
brought
Lydgate
into
her
*NL*
memories
.
They
all
owed
their
significance
to
her
marriage
and
its
*NL*
troubles
--
but
no
;
there
were
two
occasions
in
which
the
image
of
*NL*
Lydgate
had
come
painfully
in
connection
with
his
wife
and
some
one
*NL*
else
.
The
pain
had
been
allayed
for
Dorothea
,
but
it
had
left
in
her
*NL*
an
awakened
conjecture
as
to
what
Lydgate
's
marriage
might
be
to
him
,
a
*NL*
susceptibility
to
the
slightest
hint
about
Mrs.
Lydgate
.
These
*NL*
thoughts
were
like
a
drama
to
her
,
and
made
her
eyes
bright
,
and
gave
*NL*
an
attitude
of
suspense
to
her
whole
frame
,
though
she
was
only
looking
*NL*
out
from
the
brown
library
on
to
the
turf
and
the
bright
green
buds
*NL*
which
stood
in
relief
against
the
dark
evergreens
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Lydgate
came
in
,
she
was
almost
shocked
at
the
change
in
his
face
,
*NL*
which
was
strikingly
perceptible
to
her
who
had
not
seen
him
for
two
*NL*
months
.
It
was
not
the
change
of
emaciation
,
but
that
effect
which
*NL*
even
young
faces
will
very
soon
show
from
the
persistent
presence
of
*NL*
resentment
and
despondency
.
Her
cordial
look
,
when
she
put
out
her
*NL*
hand
to
him
,
softened
his
expression
,
but
only
with
melancholy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
wished
very
much
to
see
you
for
a
long
while
,
Mr.
Lydgate
,
''
*NL*
said
Dorothea
when
they
were
seated
opposite
each
other
;
``
but
I
put
off
*NL*
asking
you
to
come
until
Mr.
Bulstrode
applied
to
me
again
about
the
*NL*
Hospital
.
I
know
that
the
advantage
of
keeping
the
management
of
it
*NL*
separate
from
that
of
the
Infirmary
depends
on
you
,
or
,
at
least
,
on
*NL*
the
good
which
you
are
encouraged
to
hope
for
from
having
it
under
your
*NL*
control
.
And
I
am
sure
you
will
not
refuse
to
tell
me
exactly
what
you
*NL*
think
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
want
to
decide
whether
you
should
give
a
generous
support
to
the
*NL*
Hospital
,
''
said
Lydgate
.
``
I
can
not
conscientiously
advise
you
to
do
it
*NL*
in
dependence
on
any
activity
of
mine
.
I
may
be
obliged
to
leave
the
*NL*
town
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
spoke
curtly
,
feeling
the
ache
of
despair
as
to
his
being
able
to
*NL*
carry
out
any
purpose
that
Rosamond
had
set
her
mind
against
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
because
there
is
no
one
to
believe
in
you
?
''
said
Dorothea
,
pouring
*NL*
out
her
words
in
clearness
from
a
full
heart
.
``
I
know
the
unhappy
*NL*
mistakes
about
you
.
I
knew
them
from
the
first
moment
to
be
mistakes
.
*NL*
You
have
never
done
anything
vile
.
You
would
not
do
anything
*NL*
dishonorable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
first
assurance
of
belief
in
him
that
had
fallen
on
*NL*
Lydgate
's
ears
.
He
drew
a
deep
breath
,
and
said
,
``
Thank
you
.
''
He
could
*NL*
say
no
more
:
it
was
something
very
new
and
strange
in
his
life
that
*NL*
these
few
words
of
trust
from
a
woman
should
be
so
much
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beseech
you
to
tell
me
how
everything
was
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
*NL*
fearlessly
.
``
I
am
sure
that
the
truth
would
clear
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lydgate
started
up
from
his
chair
and
went
towards
the
window
,
*NL*
forgetting
where
he
was
.
He
had
so
often
gone
over
in
his
mind
the
*NL*
possibility
of
explaining
everything
without
aggravating
appearances
*NL*
that
would
tell
,
perhaps
unfairly
,
against
Bulstrode
,
and
had
so
often
*NL*
decided
against
it
--
he
had
so
often
said
to
himself
that
his
assertions
*NL*
would
not
change
people
's
impressions
--
that
Dorothea
's
words
sounded
*NL*
like
a
temptation
to
do
something
which
in
his
soberness
he
had
*NL*
pronounced
to
be
unreasonable
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
,
pray
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
with
simple
earnestness
;
``
then
we
can
*NL*
consult
together
.
It
is
wicked
to
let
people
think
evil
of
any
one
*NL*
falsely
,
when
it
can
be
hindered
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lydgate
turned
,
remembering
where
he
was
,
and
saw
Dorothea
's
face
*NL*
looking
up
at
him
with
a
sweet
trustful
gravity
.
The
presence
of
a
*NL*
noble
nature
,
generous
in
its
wishes
,
ardent
in
its
charity
,
changes
*NL*
the
lights
for
us
:
we
begin
to
see
things
again
in
their
larger
,
*NL*
quieter
masses
,
and
to
believe
that
we
too
can
be
seen
and
judged
in
*NL*
the
wholeness
of
our
character
.
That
influence
was
beginning
to
act
on
*NL*
Lydgate
,
who
had
for
many
days
been
seeing
all
life
as
one
who
is
*NL*
dragged
and
struggling
amid
the
throng
.
He
sat
down
again
,
and
felt
*NL*
that
he
was
recovering
his
old
self
in
the
consciousness
that
he
was
*NL*
with
one
who
believed
in
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
want
,
''
he
said
,
``
to
bear
hard
on
Bulstrode
,
who
has
lent
me
*NL*
money
of
which
I
was
in
need
--
though
I
would
rather
have
gone
without
*NL*
it
now
.
He
is
hunted
down
and
miserable
,
and
has
only
a
poor
thread
of
*NL*
life
in
him
.
But
I
should
like
to
tell
you
everything
.
It
will
be
a
*NL*
comfort
to
me
to
speak
where
belief
has
gone
beforehand
,
and
where
I
*NL*
shall
not
seem
to
be
offering
assertions
of
my
own
honesty
.
You
will
*NL*
feel
what
is
fair
to
another
,
as
you
feel
what
is
fair
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
trust
me
,
''
said
Dorothea
;
``
I
will
not
repeat
anything
without
your
*NL*
leave
.
But
at
the
very
least
,
I
could
say
that
you
have
made
all
the
*NL*
circumstances
clear
to
me
,
and
that
I
know
you
are
not
in
any
way
*NL*
guilty
.
Mr.
Farebrother
would
believe
me
,
and
my
uncle
,
and
Sir
James
*NL*
Chettam
.
Nay
,
there
are
persons
in
Middlemarch
to
whom
I
could
go
;
*NL*
although
they
do
n't
know
much
of
me
,
they
would
believe
me
.
They
would
*NL*
know
that
I
could
have
no
other
motive
than
truth
and
justice
.
I
would
*NL*
take
any
pains
to
clear
you
.
I
have
very
little
to
do
.
There
is
*NL*
nothing
better
that
I
can
do
in
the
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
's
voice
,
as
she
made
this
childlike
picture
of
what
she
would
*NL*
do
,
might
have
been
almost
taken
as
a
proof
that
she
could
do
it
*NL*
effectively
.
The
searching
tenderness
of
her
woman
's
tones
seemed
made
*NL*
for
a
defence
against
ready
accusers
.
Lydgate
did
not
stay
to
think
*NL*
that
she
was
Quixotic
:
he
gave
himself
up
,
for
the
first
time
in
his
*NL*
life
,
to
the
exquisite
sense
of
leaning
entirely
on
a
generous
*NL*
sympathy
,
without
any
check
of
proud
reserve
.
And
he
told
her
*NL*
everything
,
from
the
time
when
,
under
the
pressure
of
his
difficulties
,
*NL*
he
unwillingly
made
his
first
application
to
Bulstrode
;
gradually
,
in
*NL*
the
relief
of
speaking
,
getting
into
a
more
thorough
utterance
of
what
*NL*
had
gone
on
in
his
mind
--
entering
fully
into
the
fact
that
his
*NL*
treatment
of
the
patient
was
opposed
to
the
dominant
practice
,
into
his
*NL*
doubts
at
the
last
,
his
ideal
of
medical
duty
,
and
his
uneasy
*NL*
consciousness
that
the
acceptance
of
the
money
had
made
some
difference
*NL*
in
his
private
inclination
and
professional
behavior
,
though
not
in
his
*NL*
fulfilment
of
any
publicly
recognized
obligation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
has
come
to
my
knowledge
since
,
''
he
added
,
``
that
Hawley
sent
some
*NL*
one
to
examine
the
housekeeper
at
Stone
Court
,
and
she
said
that
she
*NL*
gave
the
patient
all
the
opium
in
the
phial
I
left
,
as
well
as
a
good
*NL*
deal
of
brandy
.
But
that
would
not
have
been
opposed
to
ordinary
*NL*
prescriptions
,
even
of
first-rate
men
.
The
suspicions
against
me
had
*NL*
no
hold
there
:
they
are
grounded
on
the
knowledge
that
I
took
money
,
*NL*
that
Bulstrode
had
strong
motives
for
wishing
the
man
to
die
,
and
that
*NL*
he
gave
me
the
money
as
a
bribe
to
concur
in
some
malpractices
or
other
*NL*
against
the
patient
--
that
in
any
case
I
accepted
a
bribe
to
hold
my
*NL*
tongue
.
They
are
just
the
suspicions
that
cling
the
most
obstinately
,
*NL*
because
they
lie
in
people
's
inclination
and
can
never
be
disproved
.
*NL*
How
my
orders
came
to
be
disobeyed
is
a
question
to
which
I
do
n't
know
*NL*
the
answer
.
It
is
still
possible
that
Bulstrode
was
innocent
of
any
*NL*
criminal
intention
--
even
possible
that
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
*NL*
disobedience
,
and
merely
abstained
from
mentioning
it
.
But
all
that
*NL*
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
public
belief
.
It
is
one
of
those
cases
on
*NL*
which
a
man
is
condemned
on
the
ground
of
his
character
--
it
is
*NL*
believed
that
he
has
committed
a
crime
in
some
undefined
way
,
because
*NL*
he
had
the
motive
for
doing
it
;
and
Bulstrode
's
character
has
enveloped
*NL*
me
,
because
I
took
his
money
.
I
am
simply
blighted
--
like
a
damaged
*NL*
ear
of
corn
--
the
business
is
done
and
ca
n't
be
undone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it
is
hard
!
''
said
Dorothea
.
``
I
understand
the
difficulty
there
is
*NL*
in
your
vindicating
yourself
.
And
that
all
this
should
have
come
to
*NL*
you
who
had
meant
to
lead
a
higher
life
than
the
common
,
and
to
find
*NL*
out
better
ways
--
I
can
not
bear
to
rest
in
this
as
unchangeable
.
I
know
*NL*
you
meant
that
.
I
remember
what
you
said
to
me
when
you
first
spoke
to
*NL*
me
about
the
hospital
.
There
is
no
sorrow
I
have
thought
more
about
*NL*
than
that
--
to
love
what
is
great
,
and
try
to
reach
it
,
and
yet
to
fail
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Lydgate
,
feeling
that
here
he
had
found
room
for
the
full
*NL*
meaning
of
his
grief
.
``
I
had
some
ambition
.
I
meant
everything
to
be
*NL*
different
with
me
.
I
thought
I
had
more
strength
and
mastery
.
But
the
*NL*
most
terrible
obstacles
are
such
as
nobody
can
see
except
oneself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Suppose
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
meditatively
,
--
``
suppose
we
kept
on
the
*NL*
Hospital
according
to
the
present
plan
,
and
you
stayed
here
though
only
*NL*
with
the
friendship
and
support
of
a
few
,
the
evil
feeling
towards
you
*NL*
would
gradually
die
out
;
there
would
come
opportunities
in
which
people
*NL*
would
be
forced
to
acknowledge
that
they
had
been
unjust
to
you
,
*NL*
because
they
would
see
that
your
purposes
were
pure
.
You
may
still
win
*NL*
a
great
fame
like
the
Louis
and
Laennec
I
have
heard
you
speak
of
,
and
*NL*
we
shall
all
be
proud
of
you
,
''
she
ended
,
with
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
might
do
if
I
had
my
old
trust
in
myself
,
''
said
Lydgate
,
*NL*
mournfully
.
``
Nothing
galls
me
more
than
the
notion
of
turning
round
*NL*
and
running
away
before
this
slander
,
leaving
it
unchecked
behind
me
.
*NL*
Still
,
I
ca
n't
ask
any
one
to
put
a
great
deal
of
money
into
a
plan
*NL*
which
depends
on
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
be
quite
worth
my
while
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
simply
.
``
Only
*NL*
think
.
I
am
very
uncomfortable
with
my
money
,
because
they
tell
me
I
*NL*
have
too
little
for
any
great
scheme
of
the
sort
I
like
best
,
and
yet
I
*NL*
have
too
much
.
I
do
n't
know
what
to
do
.
I
have
seven
hundred
a-year
*NL*
of
my
own
fortune
,
and
nineteen
hundred
a-year
that
Mr.
Casaubon
left
*NL*
me
,
and
between
three
and
four
thousand
of
ready
money
in
the
bank
.
I
*NL*
wished
to
raise
money
and
pay
it
off
gradually
out
of
my
income
which
I
*NL*
do
n't
want
,
to
buy
land
with
and
found
a
village
which
should
be
a
*NL*
school
of
industry
;
but
Sir
James
and
my
uncle
have
convinced
me
that
*NL*
the
risk
would
be
too
great
.
So
you
see
that
what
I
should
most
*NL*
rejoice
at
would
be
to
have
something
good
to
do
with
my
money
:
I
*NL*
should
like
it
to
make
other
people
's
lives
better
to
them
.
It
makes
*NL*
me
very
uneasy
--
coming
all
to
me
who
do
n't
want
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
smile
broke
through
the
gloom
of
Lydgate
's
face
.
The
childlike
*NL*
grave-eyed
earnestness
with
which
Dorothea
said
all
this
was
*NL*
irresistible
--
blent
into
an
adorable
whole
with
her
ready
understanding
*NL*
of
high
experience
.
-LRB-
Of
lower
experience
such
as
plays
a
great
part
in
*NL*
the
world
,
poor
Mrs.
Casaubon
had
a
very
blurred
shortsighted
*NL*
knowledge
,
little
helped
by
her
imagination
.
-RRB-
But
she
took
the
smile
as
*NL*
encouragement
of
her
plan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
you
see
now
that
you
spoke
too
scrupulously
,
''
she
said
,
in
a
*NL*
tone
of
persuasion
.
``
The
hospital
would
be
one
good
;
and
making
your
*NL*
life
quite
whole
and
well
again
would
be
another
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lydgate
's
smile
had
died
away
.
``
You
have
the
goodness
as
well
as
the
*NL*
money
to
do
all
that
;
if
it
could
be
done

''
he
said
.
``
But
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
hesitated
a
little
while
,
looking
vaguely
towards
the
window
;
and
*NL*
she
sat
in
silent
expectation
.
At
last
he
turned
towards
her
and
said
*NL*
impetuously
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
should
I
not
tell
you
?

you
know
what
sort
of
bond
marriage
is

You
will
understand
everything

*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
felt
her
heart
beginning
to
beat
faster
.
Had
he
that
sorrow
*NL*
too
?
But
she
feared
to
say
any
word
,
and
he
went
on
immediately
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
impossible

me

The
thing
that

I

her
pain
,
if
you
were
not
obliged
*NL*
to
do
it
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
with
keen
memory
of
her
own
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
she
has
set
her
mind
against
staying
.
She
wishes
to
go
.
The
*NL*
troubles
she
has
had
here
have
wearied
her
,
''
said
Lydgate
,
breaking
off
*NL*
again
,
lest
he
should
say
too
much
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
when
she
saw
the
good
that
might
come
of
staying
--
''
said
Dorothea
,
*NL*
remonstrantly
,
looking
at
Lydgate
as
if
he
had
forgotten
the
reasons
*NL*
which
had
just
been
considered
.
He
did
not
speak
immediately
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
would
not
see
it
,
''
he
said
at
last
,
curtly
,
feeling
at
first
that
*NL*
this
statement
must
do
without
explanation
.
``
And
,
indeed
,
I
have
lost
*NL*
all
spirit
about
carrying
on
my
life
here
.
''
He
paused
a
moment
and
*NL*
then
,
following
the
impulse
to
let
Dorothea
see
deeper
into
the
*NL*
difficulty
of
his
life
,
he
said
,
``
The
fact
is
,
this
trouble
has
come
*NL*
upon
her
confusedly
.
We
have
not
been
able
to
speak
to
each
other
*NL*
about
it
.
I
am
not
sure
what
is
in
her
mind
about
it
:
she
may
fear
*NL*
that
I
have
really
done
something
base
.
It
is
my
fault
;
I
ought
to
be
*NL*
more
open
.
But
I
have
been
suffering
cruelly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
I
go
and
see
her
?
''
said
Dorothea
,
eagerly
.
``
Would
she
accept
my
*NL*
sympathy
?
I
would
tell
her
that
you
have
not
been
blamable
before
any
*NL*
one
's
judgment
but
your
own
.
I
would
tell
her
that
you
shall
be
*NL*
cleared
in
every
fair
mind
.
I
would
cheer
her
heart
.
Will
you
ask
her
*NL*
if
I
may
go
to
see
her
?
I
did
see
her
once
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sure
you
may
,
''
said
Lydgate
,
seizing
the
proposition
with
some
*NL*
hope
.
``
She
would
feel
honored
--
cheered
,
I
think
,
by
the
proof
that
you
*NL*
at
least
have
some
respect
for
me
.
I
will
not
speak
to
her
about
your
*NL*
coming
--
that
she
may
not
connect
it
with
my
wishes
at
all
.
I
know
very
*NL*
well
that
I
ought
not
to
have
left
anything
to
be
told
her
by
others
,
*NL*
but
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
broke
off
,
and
there
was
a
moment
's
silence
.
Dorothea
refrained
*NL*
from
saying
what
was
in
her
mind
--
how
well
she
knew
that
there
might
be
*NL*
invisible
barriers
to
speech
between
husband
and
wife
.
This
was
a
*NL*
point
on
which
even
sympathy
might
make
a
wound
.
She
returned
to
the
*NL*
more
outward
aspect
of
Lydgate
's
position
,
saying
cheerfully
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
if
Mrs.
Lydgate
knew
that
there
were
friends
who
would
believe
in
*NL*
you
and
support
you
,
she
might
then
be
glad
that
you
should
stay
in
*NL*
your
place
and
recover
your
hopes
--
and
do
what
you
meant
to
do
.
*NL*
Perhaps
then
you
would
see
that
it
was
right
to
agree
with
what
I
*NL*
proposed
about
your
continuing
at
the
Hospital
.
Surely
you
would
,
if
*NL*
you
still
have
faith
in
it
as
a
means
of
making
your
knowledge
useful
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lydgate
did
not
answer
,
and
she
saw
that
he
was
debating
with
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
need
not
decide
immediately
,
''
she
said
,
gently
.
``
A
few
days
hence
*NL*
it
will
be
early
enough
for
me
to
send
my
answer
to
Mr.
Bulstrode
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lydgate
still
waited
,
but
at
last
turned
to
speak
in
his
most
decisive
*NL*
tones
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
I
prefer
that
there
should
be
no
interval
left
for
wavering
.
I
am
*NL*
no
longer
sure
enough
of
myself
--
I
mean
of
what
it
would
be
possible
*NL*
for
me
to
do
under
the
changed
circumstances
of
my
life
.
It
would
be
*NL*
dishonorable
to
let
others
engage
themselves
to
anything
serious
in
*NL*
dependence
on
me
.
I
might
be
obliged
to
go
away
after
all
;
I
see
*NL*
little
chance
of
anything
else
.
The
whole
thing
is
too
problematic
;
I
*NL*
can
not
consent
to
be
the
cause
of
your
goodness
being
wasted
.
No
--
let
*NL*
the
new
Hospital
be
joined
with
the
old
Infirmary
,
and
everything
go
on
*NL*
as
it
might
have
done
if
I
had
never
come
.
I
have
kept
a
valuable
*NL*
register
since
I
have
been
there
;
I
shall
send
it
to
a
man
who
will
*NL*
make
use
of
it
,
''
he
ended
bitterly
.
``
I
can
think
of
nothing
for
a
long
*NL*
while
but
getting
an
income
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
hurts
me
very
much
to
hear
you
speak
so
hopelessly
,
''
said
Dorothea
.
*NL*
``
It
would
be
a
happiness
to
your
friends
,
who
believe
in
your
future
,
*NL*
in
your
power
to
do
great
things
,
if
you
would
let
them
save
you
from
*NL*
that
.
Think
how
much
money
I
have
;
it
would
be
like
taking
a
burthen
*NL*
from
me
if
you
took
some
of
it
every
year
till
you
got
free
from
this
*NL*
fettering
want
of
income
.
Why
should
not
people
do
these
things
?
It
*NL*
is
so
difficult
to
make
shares
at
all
even
.
This
is
one
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
bless
you
,
Mrs.
Casaubon
!
''
said
Lydgate
,
rising
as
if
with
the
*NL*
same
impulse
that
made
his
words
energetic
,
and
resting
his
arm
on
the
*NL*
back
of
the
great
leather
chair
he
had
been
sitting
in
.
``
It
is
good
*NL*
that
you
should
have
such
feelings
.
But
I
am
not
the
man
who
ought
to
*NL*
allow
himself
to
benefit
by
them
.
I
have
not
given
guarantees
enough
.
*NL*
I
must
not
at
least
sink
into
the
degradation
of
being
pensioned
for
*NL*
work
that
I
never
achieved
.
It
is
very
clear
to
me
that
I
must
not
*NL*
count
on
anything
else
than
getting
away
from
Middlemarch
as
soon
as
I
*NL*
can
manage
it
.
I
should
not
be
able
for
a
long
while
,
at
the
very
*NL*
best
,
to
get
an
income
here
,
and
--
and
it
is
easier
to
make
necessary
*NL*
changes
in
a
new
place
.
I
must
do
as
other
men
do
,
and
think
what
will
*NL*
please
the
world
and
bring
in
money
;
look
for
a
little
opening
in
the
*NL*
London
crowd
,
and
push
myself
;
set
up
in
a
watering-place
,
or
go
to
*NL*
some
southern
town
where
there
are
plenty
of
idle
English
,
and
get
*NL*
myself
puffed
,
--
that
is
the
sort
of
shell
I
must
creep
into
and
try
to
*NL*
keep
my
soul
alive
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
that
is
not
brave
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
--
``
to
give
up
the
fight
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
it
is
not
brave
,
''
said
Lydgate
,
``
but
if
a
man
is
afraid
of
*NL*
creeping
paralysis
?
''
Then
,
in
another
tone
,
``
Yet
you
have
made
a
great
*NL*
difference
in
my
courage
by
believing
in
me
.
Everything
seems
more
*NL*
bearable
since
I
have
talked
to
you
;
and
if
you
can
clear
me
in
a
few
*NL*
other
minds
,
especially
in
Farebrother
's
,
I
shall
be
deeply
grateful
.
*NL*
The
point
I
wish
you
not
to
mention
is
the
fact
of
disobedience
to
my
*NL*
orders
.
That
would
soon
get
distorted
.
After
all
,
there
is
no
*NL*
evidence
for
me
but
people
's
opinion
of
me
beforehand
.
You
can
only
*NL*
repeat
my
own
report
of
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Farebrother
will
believe
--
others
will
believe
,
''
said
Dorothea
.
``
I
*NL*
can
say
of
you
what
will
make
it
stupidity
to
suppose
that
you
would
be
*NL*
bribed
to
do
a
wickedness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
said
Lydgate
,
with
something
like
a
groan
in
his
voice
.
*NL*
``
I
have
not
taken
a
bribe
yet
.
But
there
is
a
pale
shade
of
bribery
*NL*
which
is
sometimes
called
prosperity
.
You
will
do
me
another
great
*NL*
kindness
,
then
,
and
come
to
see
my
wife
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
will
.
I
remember
how
pretty
she
is
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
into
whose
*NL*
mind
every
impression
about
Rosamond
had
cut
deep
.
``
I
hope
she
will
*NL*
like
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
Lydgate
rode
away
,
he
thought
,
``
This
young
creature
has
a
heart
*NL*
large
enough
for
the
Virgin
Mary
.
She
evidently
thinks
nothing
of
her
*NL*
own
future
,
and
would
pledge
away
half
her
income
at
once
,
as
if
she
*NL*
wanted
nothing
for
herself
but
a
chair
to
sit
in
from
which
she
can
*NL*
look
down
with
those
clear
eyes
at
the
poor
mortals
who
pray
to
her
.
*NL*
She
seems
to
have
what
I
never
saw
in
any
woman
before
--
a
fountain
of
*NL*
friendship
towards
men
--
a
man
can
make
a
friend
of
her
.
Casaubon
must
*NL*
have
raised
some
heroic
hallucination
in
her
.
I
wonder
if
she
could
*NL*
have
any
other
sort
of
passion
for
a
man
?
Ladislaw
?
--
there
was
*NL*
certainly
an
unusual
feeling
between
them
.
And
Casaubon
must
have
had
*NL*
a
notion
of
it
.
Well
--
her
love
might
help
a
man
more
than
her
money
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
on
her
side
had
immediately
formed
a
plan
of
relieving
Lydgate
*NL*
from
his
obligation
to
Bulstrode
,
which
she
felt
sure
was
a
part
,
*NL*
though
small
,
of
the
galling
pressure
he
had
to
bear
.
She
sat
down
at
*NL*
once
under
the
inspiration
of
their
interview
,
and
wrote
a
brief
note
,
*NL*
in
which
she
pleaded
that
she
had
more
claim
than
Mr.
Bulstrode
had
to
*NL*
the
satisfaction
of
providing
the
money
which
had
been
serviceable
to
*NL*
Lydgate
--
that
it
would
be
unkind
in
Lydgate
not
to
grant
her
the
*NL*
position
of
being
his
helper
in
this
small
matter
,
the
favor
being
*NL*
entirely
to
her
who
had
so
little
that
was
plainly
marked
out
for
her
*NL*
to
do
with
her
superfluous
money
.
He
might
call
her
a
creditor
or
by
*NL*
any
other
name
if
it
did
but
imply
that
he
granted
her
request
.
She
*NL*
enclosed
a
check
for
a
thousand
pounds
,
and
determined
to
take
the
*NL*
letter
with
her
the
next
day
when
she
went
to
see
Rosamond
.

To
mark
the
full-fraught

With

Henry
V
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
Lydgate
had
to
go
to
Brassing
,
and
told
Rosamond
that
he
*NL*
should
be
away
until
the
evening
.
Of
late
she
had
never
gone
beyond
*NL*
her
own
house
and
garden
,
except
to
church
,
and
once
to
see
her
papa
,
*NL*
to
whom
she
said
,
``
If
Tertius
goes
away
,
you
will
help
us
to
move
,
will
*NL*
you
not
,
papa
?
I
suppose
we
shall
have
very
little
money
.
I
am
sure
I
*NL*
hope
some
one
will
help
us
.
''
And
Mr.
Vincy
had
said
,
``
Yes
,
child
,
I
*NL*
do
n't
mind
a
hundred
or
two
.
I
can
see
the
end
of
that
.
''
With
these
*NL*
exceptions
she
had
sat
at
home
in
languid
melancholy
and
suspense
,
*NL*
fixing
her
mind
on
Will
Ladislaw
's
coming
as
the
one
point
of
hope
and
*NL*
interest
,
and
associating
this
with
some
new
urgency
on
Lydgate
to
make
*NL*
immediate
arrangements
for
leaving
Middlemarch
and
going
to
London
,
*NL*
till
she
felt
assured
that
the
coming
would
be
a
potent
cause
of
the
*NL*
going
,
without
at
all
seeing
how
.
This
way
of
establishing
sequences
*NL*
is
too
common
to
be
fairly
regarded
as
a
peculiar
folly
in
Rosamond
.
*NL*
And
it
is
precisely
this
sort
of
sequence
which
causes
the
greatest
*NL*
shock
when
it
is
sundered
:
for
to
see
how
an
effect
may
be
produced
is
*NL*
often
to
see
possible
missings
and
checks
;
but
to
see
nothing
except
*NL*
the
desirable
cause
,
and
close
upon
it
the
desirable
effect
,
rids
us
of
*NL*
doubt
and
makes
our
minds
strongly
intuitive
.
That
was
the
process
*NL*
going
on
in
poor
Rosamond
,
while
she
arranged
all
objects
around
her
*NL*
with
the
same
nicety
as
ever
,
only
with
more
slowness
--
or
sat
down
to
*NL*
the
piano
,
meaning
to
play
,
and
then
desisting
,
yet
lingering
on
the
*NL*
music
stool
with
her
white
fingers
suspended
on
the
wooden
front
,
and
*NL*
looking
before
her
in
dreamy
ennui
.
Her
melancholy
had
become
so
*NL*
marked
that
Lydgate
felt
a
strange
timidity
before
it
,
as
a
perpetual
*NL*
silent
reproach
,
and
the
strong
man
,
mastered
by
his
keen
sensibilities
*NL*
towards
this
fair
fragile
creature
whose
life
he
seemed
somehow
to
have
*NL*
bruised
,
shrank
from
her
look
,
and
sometimes
started
at
her
approach
,
*NL*
fear
of
her
and
fear
for
her
rushing
in
only
the
more
forcibly
after
it
*NL*
had
been
momentarily
expelled
by
exasperation
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
this
morning
Rosamond
descended
from
her
room
upstairs
--
where
she
*NL*
sometimes
sat
the
whole
day
when
Lydgate
was
out
--
equipped
for
a
walk
*NL*
in
the
town
.
She
had
a
letter
to
post
--
a
letter
addressed
to
Mr.
*NL*
Ladislaw
and
written
with
charming
discretion
,
but
intended
to
hasten
*NL*
his
arrival
by
a
hint
of
trouble
.
The
servant-maid
,
their
sole
*NL*
house-servant
now
,
noticed
her
coming
down-stairs
in
her
walking
dress
,
*NL*
and
thought
``
there
never
did
anybody
look
so
pretty
in
a
bonnet
poor
*NL*
thing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
Dorothea
's
mind
was
filled
with
her
project
of
going
to
*NL*
Rosamond
,
and
with
the
many
thoughts
,
both
of
the
past
and
the
probable
*NL*
future
,
which
gathered
round
the
idea
of
that
visit
.
Until
yesterday
*NL*
when
Lydgate
had
opened
to
her
a
glimpse
of
some
trouble
in
his
married
*NL*
life
,
the
image
of
Mrs.
Lydgate
had
always
been
associated
for
her
with
*NL*
that
of
Will
Ladislaw
.
Even
in
her
most
uneasy
moments
--
even
when
she
*NL*
had
been
agitated
by
Mrs.
Cadwallader
's
painfully
graphic
report
of
*NL*
gossip
--
her
effort
,
nay
,
her
strongest
impulsive
prompting
,
had
been
*NL*
towards
the
vindication
of
Will
from
any
sullying
surmises
;
and
when
,
*NL*
in
her
meeting
with
him
afterwards
,
she
had
at
first
interpreted
his
*NL*
words
as
a
probable
allusion
to
a
feeling
towards
Mrs.
Lydgate
which
he
*NL*
was
determined
to
cut
himself
off
from
indulging
,
she
had
had
a
quick
,
*NL*
sad
,
excusing
vision
of
the
charm
there
might
be
in
his
constant
*NL*
opportunities
of
companionship
with
that
fair
creature
,
who
most
likely
*NL*
shared
his
other
tastes
as
she
evidently
did
his
delight
in
music
.
But
*NL*
there
had
followed
his
parting
words
--
the
few
passionate
words
in
*NL*
which
he
had
implied
that
she
herself
was
the
object
of
whom
his
love
*NL*
held
him
in
dread
,
that
it
was
his
love
for
her
only
which
he
was
*NL*
resolved
not
to
declare
but
to
carry
away
into
banishment
.
From
the
*NL*
time
of
that
parting
,
Dorothea
,
believing
in
Will
's
love
for
her
,
*NL*
believing
with
a
proud
delight
in
his
delicate
sense
of
honor
and
his
*NL*
determination
that
no
one
should
impeach
him
justly
,
felt
her
heart
*NL*
quite
at
rest
as
to
the
regard
he
might
have
for
Mrs.
Lydgate
.
She
was
*NL*
sure
that
the
regard
was
blameless
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
are
natures
in
which
,
if
they
love
us
,
we
are
conscious
of
having
*NL*
a
sort
of
baptism
and
consecration
:
they
bind
us
over
to
rectitude
and
*NL*
purity
by
their
pure
belief
about
us
;
and
our
sins
become
that
worst
*NL*
kind
of
sacrilege
which
tears
down
the
invisible
altar
of
trust
.
``
If
*NL*
you
are
not
good
,
none
is
good
''
--
those
little
words
may
give
a
*NL*
terrific
meaning
to
responsibility
,
may
hold
a
vitriolic
intensity
for
*NL*
remorse
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
's
nature
was
of
that
kind
:
her
own
passionate
faults
lay
along
*NL*
the
easily
counted
open
channels
of
her
ardent
character
;
and
while
she
*NL*
was
full
of
pity
for
the
visible
mistakes
of
others
,
she
had
not
yet
*NL*
any
material
within
her
experience
for
subtle
constructions
and
*NL*
suspicions
of
hidden
wrong
.
But
that
simplicity
of
hers
,
holding
up
an
*NL*
ideal
for
others
in
her
believing
conception
of
them
,
was
one
of
the
*NL*
great
powers
of
her
womanhood
.
And
it
had
from
the
first
acted
*NL*
strongly
on
Will
Ladislaw
.
He
felt
,
when
he
parted
from
her
,
that
the
*NL*
brief
words
by
which
he
had
tried
to
convey
to
her
his
feeling
about
*NL*
herself
and
the
division
which
her
fortune
made
between
them
,
would
*NL*
only
profit
by
their
brevity
when
Dorothea
had
to
interpret
them
:
he
*NL*
felt
that
in
her
mind
he
had
found
his
highest
estimate
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
was
right
there
.
In
the
months
since
their
parting
Dorothea
had
*NL*
felt
a
delicious
though
sad
repose
in
their
relation
to
each
other
,
as
*NL*
one
which
was
inwardly
whole
and
without
blemish
.
She
had
an
active
*NL*
force
of
antagonism
within
her
,
when
the
antagonism
turned
on
the
*NL*
defence
either
of
plans
or
persons
that
she
believed
in
;
and
the
wrongs
*NL*
which
she
felt
that
Will
had
received
from
her
husband
,
and
the
*NL*
external
conditions
which
to
others
were
grounds
for
slighting
him
,
*NL*
only
gave
the
more
tenacity
to
her
affection
and
admiring
judgment
.
*NL*
And
now
with
the
disclosures
about
Bulstrode
had
come
another
fact
*NL*
affecting
Will
's
social
position
,
which
roused
afresh
Dorothea
's
inward
*NL*
resistance
to
what
was
said
about
him
in
that
part
of
her
world
which
*NL*
lay
within
park
palings
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Young
Ladislaw
the
grandson
of
a
thieving
Jew
pawnbroker
''
was
a
phrase
*NL*
which
had
entered
emphatically
into
the
dialogues
about
the
Bulstrode
*NL*
business
,
at
Lowick
,
Tipton
,
and
Freshitt
,
and
was
a
worse
kind
of
*NL*
placard
on
poor
Will
's
back
than
the
``
Italian
with
white
mice
.
''
*NL*
Upright
Sir
James
Chettam
was
convinced
that
his
own
satisfaction
was
*NL*
righteous
when
he
thought
with
some
complacency
that
here
was
an
added
*NL*
league
to
that
mountainous
distance
between
Ladislaw
and
Dorothea
,
*NL*
which
enabled
him
to
dismiss
any
anxiety
in
that
direction
as
too
*NL*
absurd
.
And
perhaps
there
had
been
some
pleasure
in
pointing
Mr.
*NL*
Brooke
's
attention
to
this
ugly
bit
of
Ladislaw
's
genealogy
,
as
a
fresh
*NL*
candle
for
him
to
see
his
own
folly
by
.
Dorothea
had
observed
the
*NL*
animus
with
which
Will
's
part
in
the
painful
story
had
been
recalled
*NL*
more
than
once
;
but
she
had
uttered
no
word
,
being
checked
now
,
as
she
*NL*
had
not
been
formerly
in
speaking
of
Will
,
by
the
consciousness
of
a
*NL*
deeper
relation
between
them
which
must
always
remain
in
consecrated
*NL*
secrecy
.
But
her
silence
shrouded
her
resistant
emotion
into
a
more
*NL*
thorough
glow
;
and
this
misfortune
in
Will
's
lot
which
,
it
seemed
,
*NL*
others
were
wishing
to
fling
at
his
back
as
an
opprobrium
,
only
gave
*NL*
something
more
of
enthusiasm
to
her
clinging
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
entertained
no
visions
of
their
ever
coming
into
nearer
union
,
and
*NL*
yet
she
had
taken
no
posture
of
renunciation
.
She
had
accepted
her
*NL*
whole
relation
to
Will
very
simply
as
part
of
her
marriage
sorrows
,
and
*NL*
would
have
thought
it
very
sinful
in
her
to
keep
up
an
inward
wail
*NL*
because
she
was
not
completely
happy
,
being
rather
disposed
to
dwell
on
*NL*
the
superfluities
of
her
lot
.
She
could
bear
that
the
chief
pleasures
*NL*
of
her
tenderness
should
lie
in
memory
,
and
the
idea
of
marriage
came
*NL*
to
her
solely
as
a
repulsive
proposition
from
some
suitor
of
whom
she
*NL*
at
present
knew
nothing
,
but
whose
merits
,
as
seen
by
her
friends
,
*NL*
would
be
a
source
of
torment
to
her
:
--
``
somebody
who
will
manage
your
*NL*
property
for
you
,
my
dear
,
''
was
Mr.
Brooke
's
attractive
suggestion
of
*NL*
suitable
characteristics
.
``
I
should
like
to
manage
it
myself
,
if
I
*NL*
knew
what
to
do
with
it
,
''
said
Dorothea
.
No
--
she
adhered
to
her
*NL*
declaration
that
she
would
never
be
married
again
,
and
in
the
long
*NL*
valley
of
her
life
which
looked
so
flat
and
empty
of
waymarks
,
guidance
*NL*
would
come
as
she
walked
along
the
road
,
and
saw
her
fellow-passengers
*NL*
by
the
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
habitual
state
of
feeling
about
Will
Ladislaw
had
been
strong
in
*NL*
all
her
waking
hours
since
she
had
proposed
to
pay
a
visit
to
Mrs.
*NL*
Lydgate
,
making
a
sort
of
background
against
which
she
saw
Rosamond
's
*NL*
figure
presented
to
her
without
hindrances
to
her
interest
and
*NL*
compassion
.
There
was
evidently
some
mental
separation
,
some
barrier
*NL*
to
complete
confidence
which
had
arisen
between
this
wife
and
the
*NL*
husband
who
had
yet
made
her
happiness
a
law
to
him
.
That
was
a
*NL*
trouble
which
no
third
person
must
directly
touch
.
But
Dorothea
*NL*
thought
with
deep
pity
of
the
loneliness
which
must
have
come
upon
*NL*
Rosamond
from
the
suspicions
cast
on
her
husband
;
and
there
would
*NL*
surely
be
help
in
the
manifestation
of
respect
for
Lydgate
and
sympathy
*NL*
with
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
talk
to
her
about
her
husband
,
''
thought
Dorothea
,
as
she
was
*NL*
being
driven
towards
the
town
.
The
clear
spring
morning
,
the
scent
of
*NL*
the
moist
earth
,
the
fresh
leaves
just
showing
their
creased-up
wealth
*NL*
of
greenery
from
out
their
half-opened
sheaths
,
seemed
part
of
the
*NL*
cheerfulness
she
was
feeling
from
a
long
conversation
with
Mr.
*NL*
Farebrother
,
who
had
joyfully
accepted
the
justifying
explanation
of
*NL*
Lydgate
's
conduct
.
``
I
shall
take
Mrs.
Lydgate
good
news
,
and
perhaps
*NL*
she
will
like
to
talk
to
me
and
make
a
friend
of
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
had
another
errand
in
Lowick
Gate
:
it
was
about
a
new
*NL*
fine-toned
bell
for
the
school-house
,
and
as
she
had
to
get
out
of
her
*NL*
carriage
very
near
to
Lydgate
's
,
she
walked
thither
across
the
street
,
*NL*
having
told
the
coachman
to
wait
for
some
packages
.
The
street
door
*NL*
was
open
,
and
the
servant
was
taking
the
opportunity
of
looking
out
at
*NL*
the
carriage
which
was
pausing
within
sight
when
it
became
apparent
to
*NL*
her
that
the
lady
who
``
belonged
to
it
''
was
coming
towards
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
Mrs.
Lydgate
at
home
?
''
said
Dorothea
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
sure
,
my
lady
;
I
'll
see
,
if
you
'll
please
to
walk
in
,
''
said
*NL*
Martha
,
a
little
confused
on
the
score
of
her
kitchen
apron
,
but
*NL*
collected
enough
to
be
sure
that
``
mum
''
was
not
the
right
title
for
this
*NL*
queenly
young
widow
with
a
carriage
and
pair
.
``
Will
you
please
to
walk
*NL*
in
,
and
I
'll
go
and
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
that
I
am
Mrs.
Casaubon
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
as
Martha
moved
forward
*NL*
intending
to
show
her
into
the
drawing-room
and
then
to
go
up-stairs
to
*NL*
see
if
Rosamond
had
returned
from
her
walk
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
crossed
the
broader
part
of
the
entrance-hall
,
and
turned
up
the
*NL*
passage
which
led
to
the
garden
.
The
drawing-room
door
was
unlatched
,
*NL*
and
Martha
,
pushing
it
without
looking
into
the
room
,
waited
for
Mrs.
*NL*
Casaubon
to
enter
and
then
turned
away
,
the
door
having
swung
open
and
*NL*
swung
back
again
without
noise
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
had
less
of
outward
vision
than
usual
this
morning
,
being
*NL*
filled
with
images
of
things
as
they
had
been
and
were
going
to
be
.
*NL*
She
found
herself
on
the
other
side
of
the
door
without
seeing
anything
*NL*
remarkable
,
but
immediately
she
heard
a
voice
speaking
in
low
tones
*NL*
which
startled
her
as
with
a
sense
of
dreaming
in
daylight
,
and
*NL*
advancing
unconsciously
a
step
or
two
beyond
the
projecting
slab
of
a
*NL*
bookcase
,
she
saw
,
in
the
terrible
illumination
of
a
certainty
which
*NL*
filled
up
all
outlines
,
something
which
made
her
pause
,
motionless
,
*NL*
without
self-possession
enough
to
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
Seated
with
his
back
towards
her
on
a
sofa
which
stood
against
the
wall
*NL*
on
a
line
with
the
door
by
which
she
had
entered
,
she
saw
Will
*NL*
Ladislaw
:
close
by
him
and
turned
towards
him
with
a
flushed
*NL*
tearfulness
which
gave
a
new
brilliancy
to
her
face
sat
Rosamond
,
her
*NL*
bonnet
hanging
back
,
while
Will
leaning
towards
her
clasped
both
her
*NL*
upraised
hands
in
his
and
spoke
with
low-toned
fervor
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rosamond
in
her
agitated
absorption
had
not
noticed
the
silently
*NL*
advancing
figure
;
but
when
Dorothea
,
after
the
first
immeasurable
*NL*
instant
of
this
vision
,
moved
confusedly
backward
and
found
herself
*NL*
impeded
by
some
piece
of
furniture
,
Rosamond
was
suddenly
aware
of
her
*NL*
presence
,
and
with
a
spasmodic
movement
snatched
away
her
hands
and
*NL*
rose
,
looking
at
Dorothea
who
was
necessarily
arrested
.
Will
Ladislaw
,
*NL*
starting
up
,
looked
round
also
,
and
meeting
Dorothea
's
eyes
with
a
new
*NL*
lightning
in
them
,
seemed
changing
to
marble
:
But
she
immediately
*NL*
turned
them
away
from
him
to
Rosamond
and
said
in
a
firm
voice
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excuse
me
,
Mrs.
Lydgate
,
the
servant
did
not
know
that
you
were
here
.
*NL*
I
called
to
deliver
an
important
letter
for
Mr.
Lydgate
,
which
I
wished
*NL*
to
put
into
your
own
hands
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
laid
down
the
letter
on
the
small
table
which
had
checked
her
*NL*
retreat
,
and
then
including
Rosamond
and
Will
in
one
distant
glance
and
*NL*
bow
,
she
went
quickly
out
of
the
room
,
meeting
in
the
passage
the
*NL*
surprised
Martha
,
who
said
she
was
sorry
the
mistress
was
not
at
home
,
*NL*
and
then
showed
the
strange
lady
out
with
an
inward
reflection
that
*NL*
grand
people
were
probably
more
impatient
than
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
walked
across
the
street
with
her
most
elastic
step
and
was
*NL*
quickly
in
her
carriage
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Drive
on
to
Freshitt
Hall
,
''
she
said
to
the
coachman
,
and
any
one
*NL*
looking
at
her
might
have
thought
that
though
she
was
paler
than
usual
*NL*
she
was
never
animated
by
a
more
self-possessed
energy
.
And
that
was
*NL*
really
her
experience
.
It
was
as
if
she
had
drunk
a
great
draught
of
*NL*
scorn
that
stimulated
her
beyond
the
susceptibility
to
other
feelings
.
*NL*
She
had
seen
something
so
far
below
her
belief
,
that
her
emotions
*NL*
rushed
back
from
it
and
made
an
excited
throng
without
an
object
.
She
*NL*
needed
something
active
to
turn
her
excitement
out
upon
.
She
felt
*NL*
power
to
walk
and
work
for
a
day
,
without
meat
or
drink
.
And
she
would
*NL*
carry
out
the
purpose
with
which
she
had
started
in
the
morning
,
of
*NL*
going
to
Freshitt
and
Tipton
to
tell
Sir
James
and
her
uncle
all
that
*NL*
she
wished
them
to
know
about
Lydgate
,
whose
married
loneliness
under
*NL*
his
trial
now
presented
itself
to
her
with
new
significance
,
and
made
*NL*
her
more
ardent
in
readiness
to
be
his
champion
.
She
had
never
felt
*NL*
anything
like
this
triumphant
power
of
indignation
in
the
struggle
of
*NL*
her
married
life
,
in
which
there
had
always
been
a
quickly
subduing
*NL*
pang
;
and
she
took
it
as
a
sign
of
new
strength
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dodo
,
how
very
bright
your
eyes
are
!

gone
out

something

Celia
had
*NL*
been
used
to
watch
her
sister
with
expectation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
dear
,
a
great
many
things

happened

said
Dodo
,
in
her
full
*NL*
tones

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wonder
what

said
Celia
,
folding
her
arms
cozily
and
leaning
*NL*
forward
upon
them

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

all
the
troubles
of
all

Dorothea

lifting
her
arms
to
the

of
her
head

Dodo

you
going

said
Celia

a
*NL*
little
uneasy
at
this
Hamlet-like
raving
.
*NL*

Sir
James
came
in
again

ready
to
accompany
Dorothea

the
Grange

she
finished
her

well

not
swerving

resolution

at

*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
it
were
yesterday
and
I
i

the
grave

*NL*
With
her
sweet
faith
above

''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Rosamond
and
Will
stood
motionless
--
they
did
not
know
how
long
--
he
*NL*
looking
towards
the
spot
where
Dorothea
had
stood
,
and
she
looking
*NL*
towards
him
with
doubt
.
It
seemed
an
endless
time
to
Rosamond
,
in
*NL*
whose
inmost
soul
there
was
hardly
so
much
annoyance
as
gratification
*NL*
from
what
had
just
happened
.
Shallow
natures
dream
of
an
easy
sway
*NL*
over
the
emotions
of
others
,
trusting
implicitly
in
their
own
petty
*NL*
magic
to
turn
the
deepest
streams
,
and
confident
,
by
pretty
gestures
*NL*
and
remarks
,
of
making
the
thing
that
is
not
as
though
it
were
.
She
*NL*
knew
that
Will
had
received
a
severe
blow
,
but
she
had
been
little
used
*NL*
to
imagining
other
people
's
states
of
mind
except
as
a
material
cut
*NL*
into
shape
by
her
own
wishes
;
and
she
believed
in
her
own
power
to
*NL*
soothe
or
subdue
.
Even
Tertius
,
that
most
perverse
of
men
,
was
always
*NL*
subdued
in
the
long-run
:
events
had
been
obstinate
,
but
still
Rosamond
*NL*
would
have
said
now
,
as
she
did
before
her
marriage
,
that
she
never
*NL*
gave
up
what
she
had
set
her
mind
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
put
out
her
arm
and
laid
the
tips
of
her
fingers
on
Will
's
*NL*
coat-sleeve
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
touch
me
!
''
he
said
,
with
an
utterance
like
the
cut
of
a
lash
,
*NL*
darting
from
her
,
and
changing
from
pink
to
white
and
back
again
,
as
if
*NL*
his
whole
frame
were
tingling
with
the
pain
of
the
sting
.
He
wheeled
*NL*
round
to
the
other
side
of
the
room
and
stood
opposite
to
her
,
with
the
*NL*
tips
of
his
fingers
in
his
pockets
and
his
head
thrown
back
,
looking
*NL*
fiercely
not
at
Rosamond
but
at
a
point
a
few
inches
away
from
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
keenly
offended
,
but
the
Signs
she
made
of
this
were
such
as
*NL*
only
Lydgate
was
used
to
interpret
.
She
became
suddenly
quiet
and
*NL*
seated
herself
,
untying
her
hanging
bonnet
and
laying
it
down
with
her
*NL*
shawl
.
Her
little
hands
which
she
folded
before
her
were
very
cold
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
would
have
been
safer
for
Will
in
the
first
instance
to
have
taken
*NL*
up
his
hat
and
gone
away
;
but
he
had
felt
no
impulse
to
do
this
;
on
the
*NL*
contrary
,
he
had
a
horrible
inclination
to
stay
and
shatter
Rosamond
*NL*
with
his
anger
.
It
seemed
as
impossible
to
bear
the
fatality
she
had
*NL*
drawn
down
on
him
without
venting
his
fury
as
it
would
be
to
a
panther
*NL*
to
bear
the
javelin-wound
without
springing
and
biting
.
And
yet
--
how
*NL*
could
he
tell
a
woman
that
he
was
ready
to
curse
her
?
He
was
fuming
*NL*
under
a
repressive
law
which
he
was
forced
to
acknowledge
:
he
was
*NL*
dangerously
poised
,
and
Rosamond
's
voice
now
brought
the
decisive
*NL*
vibration
.
In
flute-like
tones
of
sarcasm
she
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
easily
go
after
Mrs.
Casaubon
and
explain
your
preference
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
after
her
!
''
he
burst
out
,
with
a
sharp
edge
in
his
voice
.
``
Do
you
*NL*
think
she
would
turn
to
look
at
me
,
or
value
any
word
I
ever
uttered
to
*NL*
her
again
at
more
than
a
dirty
feather
?
--
Explain
!
How
can
a
man
*NL*
explain
at
the
expense
of
a
woman
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
tell
her
what
you
please
,
''
said
Rosamond
with
more
tremor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
suppose
she
would
like
me
better
for
sacrificing
you
?
She
is
*NL*
not
a
woman
to
be
flattered
because
I
made
myself
despicable
--
to
*NL*
believe
that
I
must
be
true
to
her
because
I
was
a
dastard
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
began
to
move
about
with
the
restlessness
of
a
wild
animal
that
sees
*NL*
prey
but
can
not
reach
it
.
Presently
he
burst
out
again
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
no
hope
before
--
not
much
--
of
anything
better
to
come
.
But
I
had
*NL*
one
certainty
--
that
she
believed
in
me
.
Whatever
people
had
said
or
*NL*
done
about
me
,
she
believed
in
me
.
--
That
's
gone
!
She
'll
never
again
*NL*
think
me
anything
but
a
paltry
pretence
--
too
nice
to
take
heaven
*NL*
except
upon
flattering
conditions
,
and
yet
selling
myself
for
any
*NL*
devil
's
change
by
the
sly
.
She
'll
think
of
me
as
an
incarnate
insult
*NL*
to
her
,
from
the
first
moment
we
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Will
stopped
as
if
he
had
found
himself
grasping
something
that
must
*NL*
not
be
thrown
and
shattered
.
He
found
another
vent
for
his
rage
by
*NL*
snatching
up
Rosamond
's
words
again
,
as
if
they
were
reptiles
to
be
*NL*
throttled
and
flung
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Explain
!
Tell
a
man
to
explain
how
he
dropped
into
hell
!
Explain
my
*NL*
preference
!
I
never
had
a
_
preference
_
for
her
,
any
more
than
I
have
a
*NL*
preference
for
breathing
.
No
other
woman
exists
by
the
side
of
her
.
I
*NL*
would
rather
touch
her
hand
if
it
were
dead
,
than
I
would
touch
any
*NL*
other
woman
's
living
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Rosamond
,
while
these
poisoned
weapons
were
being
hurled
at
her
,
was
*NL*
almost
losing
the
sense
of
her
identity
,
and
seemed
to
be
waking
into
*NL*
some
new
terrible
existence
.
She
had
no
sense
of
chill
resolute
*NL*
repulsion
,
of
reticent
self-justification
such
as
she
had
known
under
*NL*
Lydgate
's
most
stormy
displeasure
:
all
her
sensibility
was
turned
into
*NL*
a
bewildering
novelty
of
pain
;
she
felt
a
new
terrified
recoil
under
a
*NL*
lash
never
experienced
before
.
What
another
nature
felt
in
opposition
*NL*
to
her
own
was
being
burnt
and
bitten
into
her
consciousness
.
When
*NL*
Will
had
ceased
to
speak
she
had
become
an
image
of
sickened
misery
:
*NL*
her
lips
were
pale
,
and
her
eyes
had
a
tearless
dismay
in
them
.
If
it
*NL*
had
been
Tertius
who
stood
opposite
to
her
,
that
look
of
misery
would
*NL*
have
been
a
pang
to
him
,
and
he
would
have
sunk
by
her
side
to
comfort
*NL*
her
,
with
that
strong-armed
comfort
which
,
she
had
often
held
very
*NL*
cheap
.
*NL*
*NL*
Let
it
be
forgiven
to
Will
that
he
had
no
such
movement
of
pity
.
He
*NL*
had
felt
no
bond
beforehand
to
this
woman
who
had
spoiled
the
ideal
*NL*
treasure
of
his
life
,
and
he
held
himself
blameless
.
He
knew
that
he
*NL*
was
cruel
,
but
he
had
no
relenting
in
him
yet
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
he
had
done
speaking
,
he
still
moved
about
,
half
in
absence
of
*NL*
mind
,
and
Rosamond
sat
perfectly
still
.
At
length
Will
,
seeming
to
*NL*
bethink
himself
,
took
up
his
hat
,
yet
stood
some
moments
irresolute
.
*NL*
He
had
spoken
to
her
in
a
way
that
made
a
phrase
of
common
politeness
*NL*
difficult
to
utter
;
and
yet
,
now
that
he
had
come
to
the
point
of
going
*NL*
away
from
her
without
further
speech
,
he
shrank
from
it
as
a
brutality
;
*NL*
he
felt
checked
and
stultified
in
his
anger
.
He
walked
towards
the
*NL*
mantel-piece
and
leaned
his
arm
on
it
,
and
waited
in
silence
for
--
he
*NL*
hardly
knew
what
.
The
vindictive
fire
was
still
burning
in
him
,
and
he
*NL*
could
utter
no
word
of
retractation
;
but
it
was
nevertheless
in
his
*NL*
mind
that
having
come
back
to
this
hearth
where
he
had
enjoyed
a
*NL*
caressing
friendship
he
had
found
calamity
seated
there
--
he
had
had
*NL*
suddenly
revealed
to
him
a
trouble
that
lay
outside
the
home
as
well
as
*NL*
within
it
.
And
what
seemed
a
foreboding
was
pressing
upon
him
as
with
*NL*
slow
pincers
:
--
that
his
life
might
come
to
be
enslaved
by
this
helpless
*NL*
woman
who
had
thrown
herself
upon
him
in
the
dreary
sadness
of
her
*NL*
heart
.
But
he
was
in
gloomy
rebellion
against
the
fact
that
his
quick
*NL*
apprehensiveness
foreshadowed
to
him
,
and
when
his
eyes
fell
on
*NL*
Rosamond
's
blighted
face
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
the
more
pitiable
*NL*
of
the
two
;
for
pain
must
enter
into
its
glorified
life
of
memory
*NL*
before
it
can
turn
into
compassion
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
they
remained
for
many
minutes
,
opposite
each
other
,
far
apart
,
*NL*
in
silence
;
Will
's
face
still
possessed
by
a
mute
rage
,
and
Rosamond
's
*NL*
by
a
mute
misery
.
The
poor
thing
had
no
force
to
fling
out
any
passion
*NL*
in
return
;
the
terrible
collapse
of
the
illusion
towards
which
all
her
*NL*
hope
had
been
strained
was
a
stroke
which
had
too
thoroughly
shaken
*NL*
her
:
her
little
world
was
in
ruins
,
and
she
felt
herself
tottering
in
*NL*
the
midst
as
a
lonely
bewildered
consciousness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Will
wished
that
she
would
speak
and
bring
some
mitigating
shadow
*NL*
across
his
own
cruel
speech
,
which
seemed
to
stand
staring
at
them
both
*NL*
in
mockery
of
any
attempt
at
revived
fellowship
.
But
she
said
nothing
,
*NL*
and
at
last
with
a
desperate
effort
over
himself
,
he
asked
,
``
Shall
I
*NL*
come
in
and
see
Lydgate
this
evening
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
like
,
''
Rosamond
answered
,
just
audibly
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
Will
went
out
of
the
house
,
Martha
never
knowing
that
he
had
*NL*
been
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
he
was
gone
,
Rosamond
tried
to
get
up
from
her
seat
,
but
fell
*NL*
back
fainting
.
When
she
came
to
herself
again
,
she
felt
too
ill
to
*NL*
make
the
exertion
of
rising
to
ring
the
bell
,
and
she
remained
helpless
*NL*
until
the
girl
,
surprised
at
her
long
absence
,
thought
for
the
first
*NL*
time
of
looking
for
her
in
all
the
down-stairs
rooms
.
Rosamond
said
*NL*
that
she
had
felt
suddenly
sick
and
faint
,
and
wanted
to
be
helped
*NL*
up-stairs
.
When
there
she
threw
herself
on
the
bed
with
her
clothes
on
,
*NL*
and
lay
in
apparent
torpor
,
as
she
had
done
once
before
on
a
memorable
*NL*
day
of
grief
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lydgate
came
home
earlier
than
he
had
expected
,
about
half-past
five
,
*NL*
and
found
her
there
.
The
perception
that
she
was
ill
threw
every
other
*NL*
thought
into
the
background
.
When
he
felt
her
pulse
,
her
eyes
rested
*NL*
on
him
with
more
persistence
than
they
had
done
for
a
long
while
,
as
if
*NL*
she
felt
some
content
that
he
was
there
.
He
perceived
the
difference
*NL*
in
a
moment
,
and
seating
himself
by
her
put
his
arm
gently
under
her
,
*NL*
and
bending
over
her
said
,
``
My
poor
Rosamond
!
has
something
agitated
*NL*
you
?
''
Clinging
to
him
she
fell
into
hysterical
sobbings
and
cries
,
and
*NL*
for
the
next
hour
he
did
nothing
but
soothe
and
tend
her
.
He
imagined
*NL*
that
Dorothea
had
been
to
see
her
,
and
that
all
this
effect
on
her
*NL*
nervous
system
,
which
evidently
involved
some
new
turning
towards
*NL*
himself
,
was
due
to
the
excitement
of
the
new
impressions
which
that
*NL*
visit
had
raised
.

Now
,
I
saw
in

that
just
as
they
had
ended
their

they
drew
nigh
to
a
very
miry
slough

was
in
the

of

plain

they

being
heedless

both
fall

When
Rosamond
was
quiet
,
and
Lydgate
had
left
her
,
hoping
that
she
*NL*
might
soon
sleep
under
the
effect
of
an
anodyne
,
he
went
into
the
*NL*
drawing-room
to
fetch
a
book
which
he
had
left
there
,
meaning
to
spend
*NL*
the
evening
in
his
work-room
,
and
he
saw
on
the
table
Dorothea
's
letter
*NL*
addressed
to
him
.
He
had
not
ventured
to
ask
Rosamond
if
Mrs.
Casaubon
*NL*
had
called
,
but
the
reading
of
this
letter
assured
him
of
the
fact

mentioned
that
it
was
to
be
carried

added
immediately
on
his
greeting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
seriously
,
I
hope
,
''
said
Will
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
only
a
slight
nervous
shock
--
the
effect
of
some
agitation
.
She
*NL*
has
been
overwrought
lately
.
The
truth
is
,
Ladislaw
,
I
am
an
unlucky
*NL*
devil
.
We
have
gone
through
several
rounds
of
purgatory
since
you
*NL*
left
,
and
I
have
lately
got
on
to
a
worse
ledge
of
it
than
ever
.
I
*NL*
suppose
you
are
only
just
come
down
--
you
look
rather
battered
--
you
*NL*
have
not
been
long
enough
in
the
town
to
hear
anything
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
travelled
all
night
and
got
to
the
White
Hart
at
eight
o'clock
this
*NL*
morning
.
I
have
been
shutting
myself
up
and
resting
,
''
said
Will
,
*NL*
feeling
himself
a
sneak
,
but
seeing
no
alternative
to
this
evasion
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
he
heard
Lydgate
's
account
of
the
troubles
which
Rosamond
had
*NL*
already
depicted
to
him
in
her
way
.
She
had
not
mentioned
the
fact
of
*NL*
Will
's
name
being
connected
with
the
public
story
--
this
detail
not
*NL*
immediately
affecting
her
--
and
he
now
heard
it
for
the
first
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
it
better
to
tell
you
that
your
name
is
mixed
up
with
the
*NL*
disclosures
,
''
said
Lydgate
,
who
could
understand
better
than
most
men
*NL*
how
Ladislaw
might
be
stung
by
the
revelation
.
``
You
will
be
sure
to
*NL*
hear
it
as
soon
as
you
turn
out
into
the
town
.
I
suppose
it
is
true
*NL*
that
Raffles
spoke
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Will
,
sardonically
.
``
I
shall
be
fortunate
if
gossip
does
*NL*
not
make
me
the
most
disreputable
person
in
the
whole
affair
.
I
should
*NL*
think
the
latest
version
must
be
,
that
I
plotted
with
Raffles
to
murder
*NL*
Bulstrode
,
and
ran
away
from
Middlemarch
for
the
purpose
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
thinking
``
Here
is
a
new
ring
in
the
sound
of
my
name
to
*NL*
recommend
it
in
her
hearing
;
however
--
what
does
it
signify
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
said
nothing
of
Bulstrode
's
offer
to
him
.
Will
was
very
open
*NL*
and
careless
about
his
personal
affairs
,
but
it
was
among
the
more
*NL*
exquisite
touches
in
nature
's
modelling
of
him
that
he
had
a
delicate
*NL*
generosity
which
warned
him
into
reticence
here
.
He
shrank
from
saying
*NL*
that
he
had
rejected
Bulstrode
's
money
,
in
the
moment
when
he
was
*NL*
learning
that
it
was
Lydgate
's
misfortune
to
have
accepted
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lydgate
too
was
reticent
in
the
midst
of
his
confidence
.
He
made
no
*NL*
allusion
to
Rosamond
's
feeling
under
their
trouble
,
and
of
Dorothea
he
*NL*
only
said
,
``
Mrs.
Casaubon
has
been
the
one
person
to
come
forward
and
*NL*
say
that
she
had
no
belief
in
any
of
the
suspicions
against
me
.
''
*NL*
Observing
a
change
in
Will
's
face
,
he
avoided
any
further
mention
of
*NL*
her
,
feeling
himself
too
ignorant
of
their
relation
to
each
other
not
*NL*
to
fear
that
his
words
might
have
some
hidden
painful
bearing
on
it
.
*NL*
And
it
occurred
to
him
that
Dorothea
was
the
real
cause
of
the
present
*NL*
visit
to
Middlemarch
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
men
were
pitying
each
other
,
but
it
was
only
Will
who
guessed
*NL*
the
extent
of
his
companion
's
trouble
.
When
Lydgate
spoke
with
*NL*
desperate
resignation
of
going
to
settle
in
London
,
and
said
with
a
*NL*
faint
smile
,
``
We
shall
have
you
again
,
old
fellow
.
''
Will
felt
*NL*
inexpressibly
mournful
,
and
said
nothing
.
Rosamond
had
that
morning
*NL*
entreated
him
to
urge
this
step
on
Lydgate
;
and
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
*NL*
he
were
beholding
in
a
magic
panorama
a
future
where
he
himself
was
*NL*
sliding
into
that
pleasureless
yielding
to
the
small
solicitations
of
*NL*
circumstance
,
which
is
a
commoner
history
of
perdition
than
any
single
*NL*
momentous
bargain
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
are
on
a
perilous
margin
when
we
begin
to
look
passively
at
our
*NL*
future
selves
,
and
see
our
own
figures
led
with
dull
consent
into
*NL*
insipid
misdoing
and
shabby
achievement
.
Poor
Lydgate
was
inwardly
*NL*
groaning
on
that
margin
,
and
Will
was
arriving
at
it
.
It
seemed
to
him
*NL*
this
evening
as
if
the
cruelty
of
his
outburst
to
Rosamond
had
made
an
*NL*
obligation
for
him
,
and
he
dreaded
the
obligation
:
he
dreaded
Lydgate
's
*NL*
unsuspecting
good-will
:
he
dreaded
his
own
distaste
for
his
spoiled
*NL*
life
,
which
would
leave
him
in
motiveless
levity
.

WORDSWORTH
:
Ode
to
Duty
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
Dorothea
had
seen
Mr.
Farebrother
in
the
morning
,
she
had
promised
*NL*
to
go
and
dine
at
the
parsonage
on
her
return
from
Freshitt
.
There
was
*NL*
a
frequent
interchange
of
visits
between
her
and
the
Farebrother
*NL*
family
,
which
enabled
her
to
say
that
she
was
not
at
all
lonely
at
the
*NL*
Manor
,
and
to
resist
for
the
present
the
severe
prescription
of
a
lady
*NL*
companion
.
When
she
reached
home
and
remembered
her
engagement
,
she
*NL*
was
glad
of
it
;
and
finding
that
she
had
still
an
hour
before
she
could
*NL*
dress
for
dinner
,
she
walked
straight
to
the
schoolhouse
and
entered
*NL*
into
a
conversation
with
the
master
and
mistress
about
the
new
bell
,
*NL*
giving
eager
attention
to
their
small
details
and
repetitions
,
and
*NL*
getting
up
a
dramatic
sense
that
her
life
was
very
busy
.
She
paused
on
*NL*
her
way
back
to
talk
to
old
Master
Bunney
who
was
putting
in
some
*NL*
garden-seeds
,
and
discoursed
wisely
with
that
rural
sage
about
the
*NL*
crops
that
would
make
the
most
return
on
a
perch
of
ground
,
and
the
*NL*
result
of
sixty
years
'
experience
as
to
soils
--
namely
,
that
if
your
*NL*
soil
was
pretty
mellow
it
would
do
,
but
if
there
came
wet
,
wet
,
wet
to
*NL*
make
it
all
of
a
mummy
,
why
then
--
*NL*
*NL*
Finding
that
the
social
spirit
had
beguiled
her
into
being
rather
late
,
*NL*
she
dressed
hastily
and
went
over
to
the
parsonage
rather
earlier
than
*NL*
was
necessary
.
That
house
was
never
dull
,
Mr.
Farebrother
,
like
*NL*
another
White
of
Selborne
,
having
continually
something
new
to
tell
of
*NL*
his
inarticulate
guests
and
proteges
,
whom
he
was
teaching
the
boys
not
*NL*
to
torment
;
and
he
had
just
set
up
a
pair
of
beautiful
goats
to
be
pets
*NL*
of
the
village
in
general
,
and
to
walk
at
large
as
sacred
animals
.
The
*NL*
evening
went
by
cheerfully
till
after
tea
,
Dorothea
talking
more
than
*NL*
usual
and
dilating
with
Mr.
Farebrother
on
the
possible
histories
of
*NL*
creatures
that
converse
compendiously
with
their
antennae
,
and
for
*NL*
aught
we
know
may
hold
reformed
parliaments
;
when
suddenly
some
*NL*
inarticulate
little
sounds
were
heard
which
called
everybody
's
*NL*
attention
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Henrietta
Noble
,
''
said
Mrs.
Farebrother
,
seeing
her
small
sister
*NL*
moving
about
the
furniture-legs
distressfully
,
``
what
is
the
matter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
lost
my
tortoise-shell
lozenge-box
.
I
fear
the
kitten
has
*NL*
rolled
it
away
,
''
said
the
tiny
old
lady
,
involuntarily
continuing
her
*NL*
beaver-like
notes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
a
great
treasure
,
aunt
?
''
said
Mr.
Farebrother
,
putting
up
his
*NL*
glasses
and
looking
at
the
carpet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Ladislaw
gave
it
me
,
''
said
Miss
Noble
.
``
A
German
box
--
very
*NL*
pretty
,
but
if
it
falls
it
always
spins
away
as
far
as
it
can
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
if
it
is
Ladislaw
's
present
,
''
said
Mr.
Farebrother
,
in
a
deep
tone
*NL*
of
comprehension
,
getting
up
and
hunting
.
The
box
was
found
at
last
*NL*
under
a
chiffonier
,
and
Miss
Noble
grasped
it
with
delight
,
saying
,
``
it
*NL*
was
under
a
fender
the
last
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
an
affair
of
the
heart
with
my
aunt
,
''
said
Mr.
Farebrother
,
*NL*
smiling
at
Dorothea
,
as
he
reseated
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
Henrietta
Noble
forms
an
attachment
to
any
one
,
Mrs.
Casaubon
,
''
*NL*
said
his
mother
,
emphatically
,
--
``
she
is
like
a
dog
--
she
would
take
*NL*
their
shoes
for
a
pillow
and
sleep
the
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Ladislaw
's
shoes
,
I
would
,
''
said
Henrietta
Noble
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
made
an
attempt
at
smiling
in
return
.
She
was
surprised
and
*NL*
annoyed
to
find
that
her
heart
was
palpitating
violently
,
and
that
it
*NL*
was
quite
useless
to
try
after
a
recovery
of
her
former
animation
.
*NL*
Alarmed
at
herself
--
fearing
some
further
betrayal
of
a
change
so
marked
*NL*
in
its
occasion
,
she
rose
and
said
in
a
low
voice
with
undisguised
*NL*
anxiety
,
``
I
must
go
;
I
have
overtired
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Farebrother
,
quick
in
perception
,
rose
and
said
,
``
It
is
true
;
you
*NL*
must
have
half-exhausted
yourself
in
talking
about
Lydgate
.
That
sort
*NL*
of
work
tells
upon
one
after
the
excitement
is
over
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
gave
her
his
arm
back
to
the
Manor
,
but
Dorothea
did
not
attempt
to
*NL*
speak
,
even
when
he
said
good-night
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
limit
of
resistance
was
reached
,
and
she
had
sunk
back
helpless
*NL*
within
the
clutch
of
inescapable
anguish
.
Dismissing
Tantripp
with
a
*NL*
few
faint
words
,
she
locked
her
door
,
and
turning
away
from
it
towards
*NL*
the
vacant
room
she
pressed
her
hands
hard
on
the
top
of
her
head
,
and
*NL*
moaned
out
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
did
love
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
came
the
hour
in
which
the
waves
of
suffering
shook
her
too
*NL*
thoroughly
to
leave
any
power
of
thought
.
She
could
only
cry
in
loud
*NL*
whispers
,
between
her
sobs
,
after
her
lost
belief
which
she
had
planted
*NL*
and
kept
alive
from
a
very
little
seed
since
the
days
in
Rome
--
after
*NL*
her
lost
joy
of
clinging
with
silent
love
and
faith
to
one
who
,
*NL*
misprized
by
others
,
was
worthy
in
her
thought
--
after
her
lost
woman
's
*NL*
pride
of
reigning
in
his
memory
--
after
her
sweet
dim
perspective
of
*NL*
hope
,
that
along
some
pathway
they
should
meet
with
unchanged
*NL*
recognition
and
take
up
the
backward
years
as
a
yesterday
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
that
hour
she
repeated
what
the
merciful
eyes
of
solitude
have
*NL*
looked
on
for
ages
in
the
spiritual
struggles
of
man
--
she
besought
*NL*
hardness
and
coldness
and
aching
weariness
to
bring
her
relief
from
the
*NL*
mysterious
incorporeal
might
of
her
anguish
:
she
lay
on
the
bare
floor
*NL*
and
let
the
night
grow
cold
around
her
;
while
her
grand
woman
's
frame
*NL*
was
shaken
by
sobs
as
if
she
had
been
a
despairing
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
two
images
--
two
living
forms
that
tore
her
heart
in
two
,
as
*NL*
if
it
had
been
the
heart
of
a
mother
who
seems
to
see
her
child
divided
*NL*
by
the
sword
,
and
presses
one
bleeding
half
to
her
breast
while
her
*NL*
gaze
goes
forth
in
agony
towards
the
half
which
is
carried
away
by
the
*NL*
lying
woman
that
has
never
known
the
mother
's
pang
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
,
with
the
nearness
of
an
answering
smile
,
here
within
the
*NL*
vibrating
bond
of
mutual
speech
,
was
the
bright
creature
whom
she
had
*NL*
trusted
--
who
had
come
to
her
like
the
spirit
of
morning
visiting
the
*NL*
dim
vault
where
she
sat
as
the
bride
of
a
worn-out
life
;
and
now
,
with
*NL*
a
full
consciousness
which
had
never
awakened
before
,
she
stretched
out
*NL*
her
arms
towards
him
and
cried
with
bitter
cries
that
their
nearness
*NL*
was
a
parting
vision
:
she
discovered
her
passion
to
herself
in
the
*NL*
unshrinking
utterance
of
despair
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
there
,
aloof
,
yet
persistently
with
her
,
moving
wherever
she
moved
,
*NL*
was
the
Will
Ladislaw
who
was
a
changed
belief
exhausted
of
hope
,
a
*NL*
detected
illusion
--
no
,
a
living
man
towards
whom
there
could
not
yet
*NL*
struggle
any
wail
of
regretful
pity
,
from
the
midst
of
scorn
and
*NL*
indignation
and
jealous
offended
pride
.
The
fire
of
Dorothea
's
anger
*NL*
was
not
easily
spent
,
and
it
flamed
out
in
fitful
returns
of
spurning
*NL*
reproach
.
Why
had
he
come
obtruding
his
life
into
hers
,
hers
that
*NL*
might
have
been
whole
enough
without
him
?
Why
had
he
brought
his
cheap
*NL*
regard
and
his
lip-born
words
to
her
who
had
nothing
paltry
to
give
in
*NL*
exchange
?
He
knew
that
he
was
deluding
her
--
wished
,
in
the
very
moment
*NL*
of
farewell
,
to
make
her
believe
that
he
gave
her
the
whole
price
of
*NL*
her
heart
,
and
knew
that
he
had
spent
it
half
before
.
Why
had
he
not
*NL*
stayed
among
the
crowd
of
whom
she
asked
nothing
--
but
only
prayed
that
*NL*
they
might
be
less
contemptible
?
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
lost
energy
at
last
even
for
her
loud-whispered
cries
and
*NL*
moans
:
she
subsided
into
helpless
sobs
,
and
on
the
cold
floor
she
*NL*
sobbed
herself
to
sleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
chill
hours
of
the
morning
twilight
,
when
all
was
dim
around
*NL*
her
,
she
awoke
--
not
with
any
amazed
wondering
where
she
was
or
what
had
*NL*
happened
,
but
with
the
clearest
consciousness
that
she
was
looking
into
*NL*
the
eyes
of
sorrow
.
She
rose
,
and
wrapped
warm
things
around
her
,
and
*NL*
seated
herself
in
a
great
chair
where
she
had
often
watched
before
.
*NL*
She
was
vigorous
enough
to
have
borne
that
hard
night
without
feeling
*NL*
ill
in
body
,
beyond
some
aching
and
fatigue
;
but
she
had
waked
to
a
new
*NL*
condition
:
she
felt
as
if
her
soul
had
been
liberated
from
its
terrible
*NL*
conflict
;
she
was
no
longer
wrestling
with
her
grief
,
but
could
sit
*NL*
down
with
it
as
a
lasting
companion
and
make
it
a
sharer
in
her
*NL*
thoughts
.
For
now
the
thoughts
came
thickly
.
It
was
not
in
Dorothea
's
*NL*
nature
,
for
longer
than
the
duration
of
a
paroxysm
,
to
sit
in
the
*NL*
narrow
cell
of
her
calamity
,
in
the
besotted
misery
of
a
consciousness
*NL*
that
only
sees
another
's
lot
as
an
accident
of
its
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
began
now
to
live
through
that
yesterday
morning
deliberately
*NL*
again
,
forcing
herself
to
dwell
on
every
detail
and
its
possible
*NL*
meaning
.
Was
she
alone
in
that
scene
?
Was
it
her
event
only
?
She
*NL*
forced
herself
to
think
of
it
as
bound
up
with
another
woman
's
life
--
a
*NL*
woman
towards
whom
she
had
set
out
with
a
longing
to
carry
some
*NL*
clearness
and
comfort
into
her
beclouded
youth
.
In
her
first
outleap
*NL*
of
jealous
indignation
and
disgust
,
when
quitting
the
hateful
room
,
she
*NL*
had
flung
away
all
the
mercy
with
which
she
had
undertaken
that
visit
.
*NL*
She
had
enveloped
both
Will
and
Rosamond
in
her
burning
scorn
,
and
it
*NL*
seemed
to
her
as
if
Rosamond
were
burned
out
of
her
sight
forever
.
But
*NL*
that
base
prompting
which
makes
a
women
more
cruel
to
a
rival
than
to
a
*NL*
faithless
lover
,
could
have
no
strength
of
recurrence
in
Dorothea
when
*NL*
the
dominant
spirit
of
justice
within
her
had
once
overcome
the
tumult
*NL*
and
had
once
shown
her
the
truer
measure
of
things
.
All
the
active
*NL*
thought
with
which
she
had
before
been
representing
to
herself
the
*NL*
trials
of
Lydgate
's
lot
,
and
this
young
marriage
union
which
,
like
her
*NL*
own
,
seemed
to
have
its
hidden
as
well
as
evident
troubles
--
all
this
*NL*
vivid
sympathetic
experience
returned
to
her
now
as
a
power
:
it
*NL*
asserted
itself
as
acquired
knowledge
asserts
itself
and
will
not
let
*NL*
us
see
as
we
saw
in
the
day
of
our
ignorance
.
She
said
to
her
own
*NL*
irremediable
grief
,
that
it
should
make
her
more
helpful
,
instead
of
*NL*
driving
her
back
from
effort
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
what
sort
of
crisis
might
not
this
be
in
three
lives
whose
contact
*NL*
with
hers
laid
an
obligation
on
her
as
if
they
had
been
suppliants
*NL*
bearing
the
sacred
branch
?
The
objects
of
her
rescue
were
not
to
be
*NL*
sought
out
by
her
fancy
:
they
were
chosen
for
her
.
She
yearned
towards
*NL*
the
perfect
Right
,
that
it
might
make
a
throne
within
her
,
and
rule
her
*NL*
errant
will
.
``
What
should
I
do
--
how
should
I
act
now
,
this
very
day
,
*NL*
if
I
could
clutch
my
own
pain
,
and
compel
it
to
silence
,
and
think
of
*NL*
those
three
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
had
taken
long
for
her
to
come
to
that
question
,
and
there
was
light
*NL*
piercing
into
the
room
.
She
opened
her
curtains
,
and
looked
out
*NL*
towards
the
bit
of
road
that
lay
in
view
,
with
fields
beyond
outside
*NL*
the
entrance-gates
.
On
the
road
there
was
a
man
with
a
bundle
on
his
*NL*
back
and
a
woman
carrying
her
baby
;
in
the
field
she
could
see
figures
*NL*
moving
--
perhaps
the
shepherd
with
his
dog
.
Far
off
in
the
bending
sky
*NL*
was
the
pearly
light
;
and
she
felt
the
largeness
of
the
world
and
the
*NL*
manifold
wakings
of
men
to
labor
and
endurance
.
She
was
a
part
of
that
*NL*
involuntary
,
palpitating
life
,
and
could
neither
look
out
on
it
from
*NL*
her
luxurious
shelter
as
a
mere
spectator
,
nor
hide
her
eyes
in
selfish
*NL*
complaining
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
she
would
resolve
to
do
that
day
did
not
yet
seem
quite
clear
,
but
*NL*
something
that
she
could
achieve
stirred
her
as
with
an
approaching
*NL*
murmur
which
would
soon
gather
distinctness
.
She
took
off
the
clothes
*NL*
which
seemed
to
have
some
of
the
weariness
of
a
hard
watching
in
them
,
*NL*
and
began
to
make
her
toilet
.
Presently
she
rang
for
Tantripp
,
who
*NL*
came
in
her
dressing-gown
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
madam
,
you
've
never
been
in
bed
this
blessed
night
,
''
burst
out
*NL*
Tantripp
,
looking
first
at
the
bed
and
then
at
Dorothea
's
face
,
which
*NL*
in
spite
of
bathing
had
the
pale
cheeks
and
pink
eyelids
of
a
mater
*NL*
dolorosa
.
``
You
'll
kill
yourself
,
you
_
will
_
.
Anybody
might
think
now
*NL*
you
had
a
right
to
give
yourself
a
little
comfort
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
be
alarmed
,
Tantripp
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
smiling
.
``
I
have
slept
;
I
*NL*
am
not
ill
.
I
shall
be
glad
of
a
cup
of
coffee
as
soon
as
possible
.
*NL*
And
I
want
you
to
bring
me
my
new
dress
;
and
most
likely
I
shall
want
*NL*
my
new
bonnet
to-day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
've
lain
there
a
month
and
more
ready
for
you
,
madam
,
and
most
*NL*
thankful
I
shall
be
to
see
you
with
a
couple
o
'
pounds
'
worth
less
of
*NL*
crape
,
''
said
Tantripp
,
stooping
to
light
the
fire
.
``
There
's
a
reason
*NL*
in
mourning
,
as
I
've
always
said
;
and
three
folds
at
the
bottom
of
your
*NL*
skirt
and
a
plain
quilling
in
your
bonnet
--
and
if
ever
anybody
looked
*NL*
like
an
angel
,
it
's
you
in
a
net
quilling
--
is
what
's
consistent
for
a
*NL*
second
year
.
At
least
,
that
's
_
my
_
thinking
,
''
ended
Tantripp
,
looking
*NL*
anxiously
at
the
fire
;
``
and
if
anybody
was
to
marry
me
flattering
*NL*
himself
I
should
wear
those
hijeous
weepers
two
years
for
him
,
he
'd
be
*NL*
deceived
by
his
own
vanity
,
that
's
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
fire
will
do
,
my
good
Tan
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
speaking
as
she
used
to
*NL*
do
in
the
old
Lausanne
days
,
only
with
a
very
low
voice
;
``
get
me
the
*NL*
coffee
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
folded
herself
in
the
large
chair
,
and
leaned
her
head
against
it
*NL*
in
fatigued
quiescence
,
while
Tantripp
went
away
wondering
at
this
*NL*
strange
contrariness
in
her
young
mistress
--
that
just
the
morning
when
*NL*
she
had
more
of
a
widow
's
face
than
ever
,
she
should
have
asked
for
her
*NL*
lighter
mourning
which
she
had
waived
before
.
Tantripp
would
never
*NL*
have
found
the
clew
to
this
mystery
.
Dorothea
wished
to
acknowledge
*NL*
that
she
had
not
the
less
an
active
life
before
her
because
she
had
*NL*
buried
a
private
joy
;
and
the
tradition
that
fresh
garments
belonged
to
*NL*
all
initiation
,
haunting
her
mind
,
made
her
grasp
after
even
that
*NL*
slight
outward
help
towards
calm
resolve
.
For
the
resolve
was
not
easy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
at
eleven
o'clock
she
was
walking
towards
Middlemarch
,
*NL*
having
made
up
her
mind
that
she
would
make
as
quietly
and
unnoticeably
*NL*
as
possible
her
second
attempt
to
see
and
save
Rosamond
.

When
Dorothea
was
again
at
Lydgate
's
door
speaking
to
Martha
,
he
was
in
*NL*
the
room
close
by
with
the
door
ajar
,
preparing
to
go
out
.
He
heard
*NL*
her
voice
,
and
immediately
came
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
that
Mrs.
Lydgate
can
receive
me
this
morning
?
''
she
said
,
*NL*
having
reflected
that
it
would
be
better
to
leave
out
all
allusion
to
*NL*
her
previous
visit
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
no
doubt
she
will
,
''
said
Lydgate
,
suppressing
his
thought
about
*NL*
Dorothea
's
looks
,
which
were
as
much
changed
as
Rosamond
's
,
``
if
you
*NL*
will
be
kind
enough
to
come
in
and
let
me
tell
her
that
you
are
here
.
*NL*
She
has
not
been
very
well
since
you
were
here
yesterday
,
but
she
is
*NL*
better
this
morning
,
and
I
think
it
is
very
likely
that
she
will
be
*NL*
cheered
by
seeing
you
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
plain
that
Lydgate
,
as
Dorothea
had
expected
,
knew
nothing
about
*NL*
the
circumstances
of
her
yesterday
's
visit
;
nay
,
he
appeared
to
imagine
*NL*
that
she
had
carried
it
out
according
to
her
intention
.
She
had
*NL*
prepared
a
little
note
asking
Rosamond
to
see
her
,
which
she
would
have
*NL*
given
to
the
servant
if
he
had
not
been
in
the
way
,
but
now
she
was
in
*NL*
much
anxiety
as
to
the
result
of
his
announcement
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
leading
her
into
the
drawing-room
,
he
paused
to
take
a
letter
*NL*
from
his
pocket
and
put
it
into
her
hands
,
saying
,
``
I
wrote
this
last
*NL*
night
,
and
was
going
to
carry
it
to
Lowick
in
my
ride
.
When
one
is
*NL*
grateful
for
something
too
good
for
common
thanks
,
writing
is
less
*NL*
unsatisfactory
than
speech
--
one
does
not
at
least
_
hear
_
how
inadequate
*NL*
the
words
are
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
's
face
brightened
.
``
It
is
I
who
have
most
to
thank
for
,
since
*NL*
you
have
let
me
take
that
place
.
You
_
have
_
consented
?
''
she
said
,
*NL*
suddenly
doubting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
the
check
is
going
to
Bulstrode
to-day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
said
no
more
,
but
went
up-stairs
to
Rosamond
,
who
had
but
lately
*NL*
finished
dressing
herself
,
and
sat
languidly
wondering
what
she
should
*NL*
do
next
,
her
habitual
industry
in
small
things
,
even
in
the
days
of
her
*NL*
sadness
,
prompting
her
to
begin
some
kind
of
occupation
,
which
she
*NL*
dragged
through
slowly
or
paused
in
from
lack
of
interest
.
She
looked
*NL*
ill
,
but
had
recovered
her
usual
quietude
of
manner
,
and
Lydgate
had
*NL*
feared
to
disturb
her
by
any
questions
.
He
had
told
her
of
Dorothea
's
*NL*
letter
containing
the
check
,
and
afterwards
he
had
said
,
``
Ladislaw
is
*NL*
come
,
Rosy
;
he
sat
with
me
last
night
;
I
dare
say
he
will
be
here
again
*NL*
to-day
.
I
thought
he
looked
rather
battered
and
depressed
.
''
And
*NL*
Rosamond
had
made
no
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
when
he
came
up
,
he
said
to
her
very
gently
,
``
Rosy
,
dear
,
Mrs.
*NL*
Casaubon
is
come
to
see
you
again
;
you
would
like
to
see
her
,
would
you
*NL*
not
?
''
That
she
colored
and
gave
rather
a
startled
movement
did
not
*NL*
surprise
him
after
the
agitation
produced
by
the
interview
yesterday
--
a
*NL*
beneficent
agitation
,
he
thought
,
since
it
seemed
to
have
made
her
turn
*NL*
to
him
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rosamond
dared
not
say
no
.
She
dared
not
with
a
tone
of
her
voice
*NL*
touch
the
facts
of
yesterday
.
Why
had
Mrs.
Casaubon
come
again
?
The
*NL*
answer
was
a
blank
which
Rosamond
could
only
fill
up
with
dread
,
for
*NL*
Will
Ladislaw
's
lacerating
words
had
made
every
thought
of
Dorothea
a
*NL*
fresh
smart
to
her
.
Nevertheless
,
in
her
new
humiliating
uncertainty
*NL*
she
dared
do
nothing
but
comply
.
She
did
not
say
yes
,
but
she
rose
and
*NL*
let
Lydgate
put
a
light
shawl
over
her
shoulders
,
while
he
said
,
``
I
am
*NL*
going
out
immediately
.
''
Then
something
crossed
her
mind
which
prompted
*NL*
her
to
say
,
``
Pray
tell
Martha
not
to
bring
any
one
else
into
the
*NL*
drawing-room
.
''
And
Lydgate
assented
,
thinking
that
he
fully
understood
*NL*
this
wish
.
He
led
her
down
to
the
drawing-room
door
,
and
then
turned
*NL*
away
,
observing
to
himself
that
he
was
rather
a
blundering
husband
to
*NL*
be
dependent
for
his
wife
's
trust
in
him
on
the
influence
of
another
*NL*
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rosamond
,
wrapping
her
soft
shawl
around
her
as
she
walked
towards
*NL*
Dorothea
,
was
inwardly
wrapping
her
soul
in
cold
reserve
.
Had
Mrs.
*NL*
Casaubon
come
to
say
anything
to
her
about
Will
?
If
so
,
it
was
a
*NL*
liberty
that
Rosamond
resented
;
and
she
prepared
herself
to
meet
every
*NL*
word
with
polite
impassibility
.
Will
had
bruised
her
pride
too
sorely
*NL*
for
her
to
feel
any
compunction
towards
him
and
Dorothea
:
her
own
*NL*
injury
seemed
much
the
greater
.
Dorothea
was
not
only
the
``
preferred
''
*NL*
woman
,
but
had
also
a
formidable
advantage
in
being
Lydgate
's
*NL*
benefactor
;
and
to
poor
Rosamond
's
pained
confused
vision
it
seemed
*NL*
that
this
Mrs.
Casaubon
--
this
woman
who
predominated
in
all
things
*NL*
concerning
her
--
must
have
come
now
with
the
sense
of
having
the
*NL*
advantage
,
and
with
animosity
prompting
her
to
use
it
.
Indeed
,
not
*NL*
Rosamond
only
,
but
any
one
else
,
knowing
the
outer
facts
of
the
case
,
*NL*
and
not
the
simple
inspiration
on
which
Dorothea
acted
,
might
well
have
*NL*
wondered
why
she
came
.
*NL*
*NL*
Looking
like
the
lovely
ghost
of
herself
,
her
graceful
slimness
wrapped
*NL*
in
her
soft
white
shawl
,
the
rounded
infantine
mouth
and
cheek
*NL*
inevitably
suggesting
mildness
and
innocence
,
Rosamond
paused
at
three
*NL*
yards
'
distance
from
her
visitor
and
bowed
.
But
Dorothea
,
who
had
*NL*
taken
off
her
gloves
,
from
an
impulse
which
she
could
never
resist
when
*NL*
she
wanted
a
sense
of
freedom
,
came
forward
,
and
with
her
face
full
of
*NL*
a
sad
yet
sweet
openness
,
put
out
her
hand
.
Rosamond
could
not
avoid
*NL*
meeting
her
glance
,
could
not
avoid
putting
her
small
hand
into
*NL*
Dorothea
's
,
which
clasped
it
with
gentle
motherliness
;
and
immediately
*NL*
a
doubt
of
her
own
prepossessions
began
to
stir
within
her
.
Rosamond
's
*NL*
eye
was
quick
for
faces
;
she
saw
that
Mrs.
Casaubon
's
face
looked
pale
*NL*
and
changed
since
yesterday
,
yet
gentle
,
and
like
the
firm
softness
of
*NL*
her
hand
.
But
Dorothea
had
counted
a
little
too
much
on
her
own
*NL*
strength
:
the
clearness
and
intensity
of
her
mental
action
this
morning
*NL*
were
the
continuance
of
a
nervous
exaltation
which
made
her
frame
as
*NL*
dangerously
responsive
as
a
bit
of
finest
Venetian
crystal
;
and
in
*NL*
looking
at
Rosamond
,
she
suddenly
found
her
heart
swelling
,
and
was
*NL*
unable
to
speak
--
all
her
effort
was
required
to
keep
back
tears
.
She
*NL*
succeeded
in
that
,
and
the
emotion
only
passed
over
her
face
like
the
*NL*
spirit
of
a
sob
;
but
it
added
to
Rosamond
's
impression
that
Mrs.
*NL*
Casaubon
's
state
of
mind
must
be
something
quite
different
from
what
*NL*
she
had
imagined
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
they
sat
down
without
a
word
of
preface
on
the
two
chairs
that
*NL*
happened
to
be
nearest
,
and
happened
also
to
be
close
together
;
though
*NL*
Rosamond
's
notion
when
she
first
bowed
was
that
she
should
stay
a
long
*NL*
way
off
from
Mrs.
Casaubon
.
But
she
ceased
thinking
how
anything
would
*NL*
turn
out
--
merely
wondering
what
would
come
.
And
Dorothea
began
to
*NL*
speak
quite
simply
,
gathering
firmness
as
she
went
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
an
errand
yesterday
which
I
did
not
finish
;
that
is
why
I
am
*NL*
here
again
so
soon
.
You
will
not
think
me
too
troublesome
when
I
tell
*NL*
you
that
I
came
to
talk
to
you
about
the
injustice
that
has
been
shown
*NL*
towards
Mr.
Lydgate
.
It
will
cheer
you
--
will
it
not
?
--
to
know
a
great
*NL*
deal
about
him
,
that
he
may
not
like
to
speak
about
himself
just
*NL*
because
it
is
in
his
own
vindication
and
to
his
own
honor
.
You
will
*NL*
like
to
know
that
your
husband
has
warm
friends
,
who
have
not
left
off
*NL*
believing
in
his
high
character
?
You
will
let
me
speak
of
this
without
*NL*
thinking
that
I
take
a
liberty
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
cordial
,
pleading
tones
which
seemed
to
flow
with
generous
*NL*
heedlessness
above
all
the
facts
which
had
filled
Rosamond
's
mind
as
*NL*
grounds
of
obstruction
and
hatred
between
her
and
this
woman
,
came
as
*NL*
soothingly
as
a
warm
stream
over
her
shrinking
fears
.
Of
course
Mrs.
*NL*
Casaubon
had
the
facts
in
her
mind
,
but
she
was
not
going
to
speak
of
*NL*
anything
connected
with
them
.
That
relief
was
too
great
for
Rosamond
*NL*
to
feel
much
else
at
the
moment
.
She
answered
prettily
,
in
the
new
*NL*
ease
of
her
soul
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
you
have
been
very
good
.
I
shall
like
to
hear
anything
you
*NL*
will
say
to
me
about
Tertius
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
day
before
yesterday
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
``
when
I
had
asked
him
to
*NL*
come
to
Lowick
to
give
me
his
opinion
on
the
affairs
of
the
Hospital
,
*NL*
he
told
me
everything
about
his
conduct
and
feelings
in
this
sad
event
*NL*
which
has
made
ignorant
people
cast
suspicions
on
him
.
The
reason
he
*NL*
told
me
was
because
I
was
very
bold
and
asked
him
.
I
believed
that
he
*NL*
had
never
acted
dishonorably
,
and
I
begged
him
to
tell
me
the
history
.
*NL*
He
confessed
to
me
that
he
had
never
told
it
before
,
not
even
to
you
,
*NL*
because
he
had
a
great
dislike
to
say
,
'
I
was
not
wrong
,
'
as
if
that
*NL*
were
proof
,
when
there
are
guilty
people
who
will
say
so
.
The
truth
*NL*
is
,
he
knew
nothing
of
this
man
Raffles
,
or
that
there
were
any
bad
*NL*
secrets
about
him
;
and
he
thought
that
Mr.
Bulstrode
offered
him
the
*NL*
money
because
he
repented
,
out
of
kindness
,
of
having
refused
it
*NL*
before
.
All
his
anxiety
about
his
patient
was
to
treat
him
rightly
,
*NL*
and
he
was
a
little
uncomfortable
that
the
case
did
not
end
as
he
had
*NL*
expected
;
but
he
thought
then
and
still
thinks
that
there
may
have
been
*NL*
no
wrong
in
it
on
any
one
's
part
.
And
I
have
told
Mr.
Farebrother
,
and
*NL*
Mr.
Brooke
,
and
Sir
James
Chettam
:
they
all
believe
in
your
husband
.
*NL*
That
will
cheer
you
,
will
it
not
?
That
will
give
you
courage
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
's
face
had
become
animated
,
and
as
it
beamed
on
Rosamond
very
*NL*
close
to
her
,
she
felt
something
like
bashful
timidity
before
a
*NL*
superior
,
in
the
presence
of
this
self-forgetful
ardor
.
She
said
,
with
*NL*
blushing
embarrassment
,
``
Thank
you
:
you
are
very
kind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
he
felt
that
he
had
been
so
wrong
not
to
pour
out
everything
about
*NL*
this
to
you
.
But
you
will
forgive
him
.
It
was
because
he
feels
so
*NL*
much
more
about
your
happiness
than
anything
else
--
he
feels
his
life
*NL*
bound
into
one
with
yours
,
and
it
hurts
him
more
than
anything
,
that
*NL*
his
misfortunes
must
hurt
you
.
He
could
speak
to
me
because
I
am
an
*NL*
indifferent
person
.
And
then
I
asked
him
if
I
might
come
to
see
you
;
*NL*
because
I
felt
so
much
for
his
trouble
and
yours
.
That
is
why
I
came
*NL*
yesterday
,
and
why
I
am
come
to-day
.
Trouble
is
so
hard
to
bear
,
is
it
*NL*
not
?
--
How
can
we
live
and
think
that
any
one
has
trouble
--
piercing
*NL*
trouble
--
and
we
could
help
them
,
and
never
try
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
,
completely
swayed
by
the
feeling
that
she
was
uttering
,
*NL*
forgot
everything
but
that
she
was
speaking
from
out
the
heart
of
her
*NL*
own
trial
to
Rosamond
's
.
The
emotion
had
wrought
itself
more
and
more
*NL*
into
her
utterance
,
till
the
tones
might
have
gone
to
one
's
very
*NL*
marrow
,
like
a
low
cry
from
some
suffering
creature
in
the
darkness
.
*NL*
And
she
had
unconsciously
laid
her
hand
again
on
the
little
hand
that
*NL*
she
had
pressed
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rosamond
,
with
an
overmastering
pang
,
as
if
a
wound
within
her
had
been
*NL*
probed
,
burst
into
hysterical
crying
as
she
had
done
the
day
before
*NL*
when
she
clung
to
her
husband
.
Poor
Dorothea
was
feeling
a
great
wave
*NL*
of
her
own
sorrow
returning
over
her
--
her
thought
being
drawn
to
the
*NL*
possible
share
that
Will
Ladislaw
might
have
in
Rosamond
's
mental
*NL*
tumult
.
She
was
beginning
to
fear
that
she
should
not
be
able
to
*NL*
suppress
herself
enough
to
the
end
of
this
meeting
,
and
while
her
hand
*NL*
was
still
resting
on
Rosamond
's
lap
,
though
the
hand
underneath
it
was
*NL*
withdrawn
,
she
was
struggling
against
her
own
rising
sobs
.
She
tried
*NL*
to
master
herself
with
the
thought
that
this
might
be
a
turning-point
*NL*
in
three
lives
--
not
in
her
own
;
no
,
there
the
irrevocable
had
*NL*
happened
,
but
--
in
those
three
lives
which
were
touching
hers
with
the
*NL*
solemn
neighborhood
of
danger
and
distress
.
The
fragile
creature
who
*NL*
was
crying
close
to
her
--
there
might
still
be
time
to
rescue
her
from
*NL*
the
misery
of
false
incompatible
bonds
;
and
this
moment
was
unlike
any
*NL*
other
:
she
and
Rosamond
could
never
be
together
again
with
the
same
*NL*
thrilling
consciousness
of
yesterday
within
them
both
.
She
felt
the
*NL*
relation
between
them
to
be
peculiar
enough
to
give
her
a
peculiar
*NL*
influence
,
though
she
had
no
conception
that
the
way
in
which
her
own
*NL*
feelings
were
involved
was
fully
known
to
Mrs.
Lydgate
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
newer
crisis
in
Rosamond
's
experience
than
even
Dorothea
could
*NL*
imagine
:
she
was
under
the
first
great
shock
that
had
shattered
her
*NL*
dream-world
in
which
she
had
been
easily
confident
of
herself
and
*NL*
critical
of
others
;
and
this
strange
unexpected
manifestation
of
*NL*
feeling
in
a
woman
whom
she
had
approached
with
a
shrinking
aversion
*NL*
and
dread
,
as
one
who
must
necessarily
have
a
jealous
hatred
towards
*NL*
her
,
made
her
soul
totter
all
the
more
with
a
sense
that
she
had
been
*NL*
walking
in
an
unknown
world
which
had
just
broken
in
upon
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Rosamond
's
convulsed
throat
was
subsiding
into
calm
,
and
she
*NL*
withdrew
the
handkerchief
with
which
she
had
been
hiding
her
face
,
her
*NL*
eyes
met
Dorothea
's
as
helplessly
as
if
they
had
been
blue
flowers
.
*NL*
What
was
the
use
of
thinking
about
behavior
after
this
crying
?
And
*NL*
Dorothea
looked
almost
as
childish
,
with
the
neglected
trace
of
a
*NL*
silent
tear
.
Pride
was
broken
down
between
these
two
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
were
talking
about
your
husband
,
''
Dorothea
said
,
with
some
*NL*
timidity
.
``
I
thought
his
looks
were
sadly
changed
with
suffering
the
*NL*
other
day
.
I
had
not
seen
him
for
many
weeks
before
.
He
said
he
had
*NL*
been
feeling
very
lonely
in
his
trial
;
but
I
think
he
would
have
borne
*NL*
it
all
better
if
he
had
been
able
to
be
quite
open
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tertius
is
so
angry
and
impatient
if
I
say
anything
,
''
said
Rosamond
,
*NL*
imagining
that
he
had
been
complaining
of
her
to
Dorothea
.
``
He
ought
*NL*
not
to
wonder
that
I
object
to
speak
to
him
on
painful
subjects
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
himself
he
blamed
for
not
speaking
,
''
said
Dorothea
.
``
What
he
*NL*
said
of
you
was
,
that
he
could
not
be
happy
in
doing
anything
which
*NL*
made
you
unhappy
--
that
his
marriage
was
of
course
a
bond
which
must
*NL*
affect
his
choice
about
everything
;
and
for
that
reason
he
refused
my
*NL*
proposal
that
he
should
keep
his
position
at
the
Hospital
,
because
that
*NL*
would
bind
him
to
stay
in
Middlemarch
,
and
he
would
not
undertake
to
do
*NL*
anything
which
would
be
painful
to
you
.
He
could
say
that
to
me
,
*NL*
because
he
knows
that
I
had
much
trial
in
my
marriage
,
from
my
*NL*
husband
's
illness
,
which
hindered
his
plans
and
saddened
him
;
and
he
*NL*
knows
that
I
have
felt
how
hard
it
is
to
walk
always
in
fear
of
hurting
*NL*
another
who
is
tied
to
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
waited
a
little
;
she
had
discerned
a
faint
pleasure
stealing
*NL*
over
Rosamond
's
face
.
But
there
was
no
answer
,
and
she
went
on
,
with
a
*NL*
gathering
tremor
,
``
Marriage
is
so
unlike
everything
else
.
There
is
*NL*
something
even
awful
in
the
nearness
it
brings
.
Even
if
we
loved
some
*NL*
one
else
better
than
--
than
those
we
were
married
to
,
it
would
be
no
*NL*
use
''
--
poor
Dorothea
,
in
her
palpitating
anxiety
,
could
only
seize
her
*NL*
language
brokenly
--
``
I
mean
,
marriage
drinks
up
all
our
power
of
giving
*NL*
or
getting
any
blessedness
in
that
sort
of
love
.
I
know
it
may
be
very
*NL*
dear
--
but
it
murders
our
marriage
--
and
then
the
marriage
stays
with
us
*NL*
like
a
murder
--
and
everything
else
is
gone
.
And
then
our
husband
--
if
*NL*
he
loved
and
trusted
us
,
and
we
have
not
helped
him
,
but
made
a
curse
*NL*
in
his
life
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
voice
had
sunk
very
low
:
there
was
a
dread
upon
her
of
presuming
*NL*
too
far
,
and
of
speaking
as
if
she
herself
were
perfection
addressing
*NL*
error
.
She
was
too
much
preoccupied
with
her
own
anxiety
,
to
be
aware
*NL*
that
Rosamond
was
trembling
too
;
and
filled
with
the
need
to
express
*NL*
pitying
fellowship
rather
than
rebuke
,
she
put
her
hands
on
Rosamond
's
,
*NL*
and
said
with
more
agitated
rapidity
,
--
``
I
know
,
I
know
that
the
feeling
*NL*
may
be
very
dear
--
it
has
taken
hold
of
us
unawares
--
it
is
so
hard
,
it
*NL*
may
seem
like
death
to
part
with
it
--
and
we
are
weak
--
I
am
weak
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
waves
of
her
own
sorrow
,
from
out
of
which
she
was
struggling
to
*NL*
save
another
,
rushed
over
Dorothea
with
conquering
force
.
She
stopped
*NL*
in
speechless
agitation
,
not
crying
,
but
feeling
as
if
she
were
being
*NL*
inwardly
grappled
.
Her
face
had
become
of
a
deathlier
paleness
,
her
*NL*
lips
trembled
,
and
she
pressed
her
hands
helplessly
on
the
hands
that
*NL*
lay
under
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rosamond
,
taken
hold
of
by
an
emotion
stronger
than
her
own
--
hurried
*NL*
along
in
a
new
movement
which
gave
all
things
some
new
,
awful
,
*NL*
undefined
aspect
--
could
find
no
words
,
but
involuntarily
she
put
her
*NL*
lips
to
Dorothea
's
forehead
which
was
very
near
her
,
and
then
for
a
*NL*
minute
the
two
women
clasped
each
other
as
if
they
had
been
in
a
*NL*
shipwreck
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
thinking
what
is
not
true
,
''
said
Rosamond
,
in
an
eager
*NL*
half-whisper
,
while
she
was
still
feeling
Dorothea
's
arms
round
*NL*
her
--
urged
by
a
mysterious
necessity
to
free
herself
from
something
*NL*
that
oppressed
her
as
if
it
were
blood
guiltiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
moved
apart
,
looking
at
each
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
you
came
in
yesterday
--
it
was
not
as
you
thought
,
''
said
Rosamond
*NL*
in
the
same
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
movement
of
surprised
attention
in
Dorothea
.
She
expected
*NL*
a
vindication
of
Rosamond
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
was
telling
me
how
he
loved
another
woman
,
that
I
might
know
he
*NL*
could
never
love
me
,
''
said
Rosamond
,
getting
more
and
more
hurried
as
*NL*
she
went
on
.
``
And
now
I
think
he
hates
me
because
--
because
you
*NL*
mistook
him
yesterday
.
He
says
it
is
through
me
that
you
will
think
*NL*
ill
of
him
--
think
that
he
is
a
false
person
.
But
it
shall
not
be
*NL*
through
me
.
He
has
never
had
any
love
for
me
--
I
know
he
has
not
--
he
*NL*
has
always
thought
slightly
of
me
.
He
said
yesterday
that
no
other
*NL*
woman
existed
for
him
beside
you
.
The
blame
of
what
happened
is
*NL*
entirely
mine
.
He
said
he
could
never
explain
to
you
--
because
of
me
.
*NL*
He
said
you
could
never
think
well
of
him
again
.
But
now
I
have
told
*NL*
you
,
and
he
can
not
reproach
me
any
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Rosamond
had
delivered
her
soul
under
impulses
which
she
had
not
known
*NL*
before
.
She
had
begun
her
confession
under
the
subduing
influence
of
*NL*
Dorothea
's
emotion
;
and
as
she
went
on
she
had
gathered
the
sense
that
*NL*
she
was
repelling
Will
's
reproaches
,
which
were
still
like
a
*NL*
knife-wound
within
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
revulsion
of
feeling
in
Dorothea
was
too
strong
to
be
called
joy
.
*NL*
It
was
a
tumult
in
which
the
terrible
strain
of
the
night
and
morning
*NL*
made
a
resistant
pain
:
--
she
could
only
perceive
that
this
would
be
joy
*NL*
when
she
had
recovered
her
power
of
feeling
it
.
Her
immediate
*NL*
consciousness
was
one
of
immense
sympathy
without
check
;
she
cared
for
*NL*
Rosamond
without
struggle
now
,
and
responded
earnestly
to
her
last
*NL*
words
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
he
can
not
reproach
you
any
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
her
usual
tendency
to
over-estimate
the
good
in
others
,
she
felt
a
*NL*
great
outgoing
of
her
heart
towards
Rosamond
,
for
the
generous
effort
*NL*
which
had
redeemed
her
from
suffering
,
not
counting
that
the
effort
was
*NL*
a
reflex
of
her
own
energy
.
After
they
had
been
silent
a
little
,
she
*NL*
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
not
sorry
that
I
came
this
morning
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
you
have
been
very
good
to
me
,
''
said
Rosamond
.
``
I
did
not
think
*NL*
that
you
would
be
so
good
.
I
was
very
unhappy
.
I
am
not
happy
now
.
*NL*
Everything
is
so
sad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
better
days
will
come
.
Your
husband
will
be
rightly
valued
.
And
*NL*
he
depends
on
you
for
comfort
.
He
loves
you
best
.
The
worst
loss
*NL*
would
be
to
lose
that
--
and
you
have
not
lost
it
,
''
said
Dorothea
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
tried
to
thrust
away
the
too
overpowering
thought
of
her
own
*NL*
relief
,
lest
she
should
fail
to
win
some
sign
that
Rosamond
's
affection
*NL*
was
yearning
back
towards
her
husband
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tertius
did
not
find
fault
with
me
,
then
?
''
said
Rosamond
,
*NL*
understanding
now
that
Lydgate
might
have
said
anything
to
Mrs.
*NL*
Casaubon
,
and
that
she
certainly
was
different
from
other
women
.
*NL*
Perhaps
there
was
a
faint
taste
of
jealousy
in
the
question
.
A
smile
*NL*
began
to
play
over
Dorothea
's
face
as
she
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
indeed
!
How
could
you
imagine
it
?
''
But
here
the
door
opened
,
and
*NL*
Lydgate
entered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
come
back
in
my
quality
of
doctor
,
''
he
said
.
``
After
I
went
away
,
*NL*
I
was
haunted
by
two
pale
faces
:
Mrs.
Casaubon
looked
as
much
in
need
*NL*
of
care
as
you
,
Rosy
.
And
I
thought
that
I
had
not
done
my
duty
in
*NL*
leaving
you
together
;
so
when
I
had
been
to
Coleman
's
I
came
home
*NL*
again
.
I
noticed
that
you
were
walking
,
Mrs.
Casaubon
,
and
the
sky
has
*NL*
changed
--
I
think
we
may
have
rain
.
May
I
send
some
one
to
order
your
*NL*
carriage
to
come
for
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
!
I
am
strong
:
I
need
the
walk
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
rising
with
*NL*
animation
in
her
face
.
``
Mrs.
Lydgate
and
I
have
chatted
a
great
deal
,
*NL*
and
it
is
time
for
me
to
go
.
I
have
always
been
accused
of
being
*NL*
immoderate
and
saying
too
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
put
out
her
hand
to
Rosamond
,
and
they
said
an
earnest
,
quiet
*NL*
good-by
without
kiss
or
other
show
of
effusion
:
there
had
been
between
*NL*
them
too
much
serious
emotion
for
them
to
use
the
signs
of
it
*NL*
superficially
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
Lydgate
took
her
to
the
door
she
said
nothing
of
Rosamond
,
but
told
*NL*
him
of
Mr.
Farebrother
and
the
other
friends
who
had
listened
with
*NL*
belief
to
his
story
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
came
back
to
Rosamond
,
she
had
already
thrown
herself
on
the
*NL*
sofa
,
in
resigned
fatigue
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Rosy
,
''
he
said
,
standing
over
her
,
and
touching
her
hair
,
``
what
*NL*
do
you
think
of
Mrs.
Casaubon
now
you
have
seen
so
much
of
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
she
must
be
better
than
any
one
,
''
said
Rosamond
,
``
and
she
is
*NL*
very
beautiful
.
If
you
go
to
talk
to
her
so
often
,
you
will
be
more
*NL*
discontented
with
me
than
ever
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lydgate
laughed
at
the
``
so
often
.
''
``
But
has
she
made
you
any
less
*NL*
discontented
with
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
she
has
,
''
said
Rosamond
,
looking
up
in
his
face
.
``
How
heavy
*NL*
your
eyes
are
,
Tertius
--
and
do
push
your
hair
back
.
''
He
lifted
up
his
*NL*
large
white
hand
to
obey
her
,
and
felt
thankful
for
this
little
mark
of
*NL*
interest
in
him
.
Poor
Rosamond
's
vagrant
fancy
had
come
back
terribly
*NL*
scourged
--
meek
enough
to
nestle
under
the
old
despised
shelter
.
And
*NL*
the
shelter
was
still
there
:
Lydgate
had
accepted
his
narrowed
lot
with
*NL*
sad
resignation
.
He
had
chosen
this
fragile
creature
,
and
had
taken
*NL*
the
burthen
of
her
life
upon
his
arms
.
He
must
walk
as
he
could
,
*NL*
carrying
that
burthen
pitifully
.

CHAPTER
LXXXII

*NL*
*NL*
``
My
grief
lies
onward
and
my
joy
behind
.
''
*NL*
--
SHAKESPEARE
:
Sonnets
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Exiles
notoriously
feed
much
on
hopes
,
and
are
unlikely
to
stay
in
*NL*
banishment
unless
they
are
obliged
.
When
Will
Ladislaw
exiled
himself
*NL*
from
Middlemarch
he
had
placed
no
stronger
obstacle
to
his
return
than
*NL*
his
own
resolve
,
which
was
by
no
means
an
iron
barrier
,
but
simply
a
*NL*
state
of
mind
liable
to
melt
into
a
minuet
with
other
states
of
mind
,
*NL*
and
to
find
itself
bowing
,
smiling
,
and
giving
place
with
polite
*NL*
facility
.
As
the
months
went
on
,
it
had
seemed
more
and
more
difficult
*NL*
to
him
to
say
why
he
should
not
run
down
to
Middlemarch
--
merely
for
the
*NL*
sake
of
hearing
something
about
Dorothea
;
and
if
on
such
a
flying
visit
*NL*
he
should
chance
by
some
strange
coincidence
to
meet
with
her
,
there
*NL*
was
no
reason
for
him
to
be
ashamed
of
having
taken
an
innocent
journey
*NL*
which
he
had
beforehand
supposed
that
he
should
not
take
.
Since
he
was
*NL*
hopelessly
divided
from
her
,
he
might
surely
venture
into
her
*NL*
neighborhood
;
and
as
to
the
suspicious
friends
who
kept
a
dragon
watch
*NL*
over
her
--
their
opinions
seemed
less
and
less
important
with
time
and
*NL*
change
of
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
there
had
come
a
reason
quite
irrespective
of
Dorothea
,
which
*NL*
seemed
to
make
a
journey
to
Middlemarch
a
sort
of
philanthropic
duty
.
*NL*
Will
had
given
a
disinterested
attention
to
an
intended
settlement
on
a
*NL*
new
plan
in
the
Far
West
,
and
the
need
for
funds
in
order
to
carry
out
*NL*
a
good
design
had
set
him
on
debating
with
himself
whether
it
would
not
*NL*
be
a
laudable
use
to
make
of
his
claim
on
Bulstrode
,
to
urge
the
*NL*
application
of
that
money
which
had
been
offered
to
himself
as
a
means
*NL*
of
carrying
out
a
scheme
likely
to
be
largely
beneficial
.
The
question
*NL*
seemed
a
very
dubious
one
to
Will
,
and
his
repugnance
to
again
entering
*NL*
into
any
relation
with
the
banker
might
have
made
him
dismiss
it
*NL*
quickly
,
if
there
had
not
arisen
in
his
imagination
the
probability
*NL*
that
his
judgment
might
be
more
safely
determined
by
a
visit
to
*NL*
Middlemarch
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
the
object
which
Will
stated
to
himself
as
a
reason
for
coming
*NL*
down
.
He
had
meant
to
confide
in
Lydgate
,
and
discuss
the
money
*NL*
question
with
him
,
and
he
had
meant
to
amuse
himself
for
the
few
*NL*
evenings
of
his
stay
by
having
a
great
deal
of
music
and
badinage
with
*NL*
fair
Rosamond
,
without
neglecting
his
friends
at
Lowick
Parsonage
:
--
if
*NL*
the
Parsonage
was
close
to
the
Manor
,
that
was
no
fault
of
his
.
He
had
*NL*
neglected
the
Farebrothers
before
his
departure
,
from
a
proud
*NL*
resistance
to
the
possible
accusation
of
indirectly
seeking
interviews
*NL*
with
Dorothea
;
but
hunger
tames
us
,
and
Will
had
become
very
hungry
for
*NL*
the
vision
of
a
certain
form
and
the
sound
of
a
certain
voice
.
*NL*
Nothing
,
had
done
instead
--
not
the
opera
,
or
the
converse
of
zealous
*NL*
politicians
,
or
the
flattering
reception
-LRB-
in
dim
corners
-RRB-
of
his
new
*NL*
hand
in
leading
articles
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
he
had
come
down
,
foreseeing
with
confidence
how
almost
everything
*NL*
would
be
in
his
familiar
little
world
;
fearing
,
indeed
,
that
there
*NL*
would
be
no
surprises
in
his
visit
.
But
he
had
found
that
humdrum
*NL*
world
in
a
terribly
dynamic
condition
,
in
which
even
badinage
and
*NL*
lyrism
had
turned
explosive
;
and
the
first
day
of
this
visit
had
become
*NL*
the
most
fatal
epoch
of
his
life
.
The
next
morning
he
felt
so
harassed
*NL*
with
the
nightmare
of
consequences
--
he
dreaded
so
much
the
immediate
*NL*
issues
before
him
--
that
seeing
while
he
breakfasted
the
arrival
of
the
*NL*
Riverston
coach
,
he
went
out
hurriedly
and
took
his
place
on
it
,
that
*NL*
he
might
be
relieved
,
at
least
for
a
day
,
from
the
necessity
of
doing
*NL*
or
saying
anything
in
Middlemarch
.
Will
Ladislaw
was
in
one
of
those
*NL*
tangled
crises
which
are
commoner
in
experience
than
one
might
imagine
,
*NL*
from
the
shallow
absoluteness
of
men
's
judgments
.
He
had
found
*NL*
Lydgate
,
for
whom
he
had
the
sincerest
respect
,
under
circumstances
*NL*
which
claimed
his
thorough
and
frankly
declared
sympathy
;
and
the
*NL*
reason
why
,
in
spite
of
that
claim
,
it
would
have
been
better
for
Will
*NL*
to
have
avoided
all
further
intimacy
,
or
even
contact
,
with
Lydgate
,
*NL*
was
precisely
of
the
kind
to
make
such
a
course
appear
impossible
.
To
*NL*
a
creature
of
Will
's
susceptible
temperament
--
without
any
neutral
*NL*
region
of
indifference
in
his
nature
,
ready
to
turn
everything
that
*NL*
befell
him
into
the
collisions
of
a
passionate
drama
--
the
revelation
*NL*
that
Rosamond
had
made
her
happiness
in
any
way
dependent
on
him
was
a
*NL*
difficulty
which
his
outburst
of
rage
towards
her
had
immeasurably
*NL*
increased
for
him
.
He
hated
his
own
cruelty
,
and
yet
he
dreaded
to
*NL*
show
the
fulness
of
his
relenting
:
he
must
go
to
her
again
;
the
*NL*
friendship
could
not
be
put
to
a
sudden
end
;
and
her
unhappiness
was
a
*NL*
power
which
he
dreaded
.
And
all
the
while
there
was
no
more
foretaste
*NL*
of
enjoyment
in
the
life
before
him
than
if
his
limbs
had
been
lopped
*NL*
off
and
he
was
making
his
fresh
start
on
crutches
.
In
the
night
he
had
*NL*
debated
whether
he
should
not
get
on
the
coach
,
not
for
Riverston
,
but
*NL*
for
London
,
leaving
a
note
to
Lydgate
which
would
give
a
makeshift
*NL*
reason
for
his
retreat
.
But
there
were
strong
cords
pulling
him
back
*NL*
from
that
abrupt
departure
:
the
blight
on
his
happiness
in
thinking
of
*NL*
Dorothea
,
the
crushing
of
that
chief
hope
which
had
remained
in
spite
*NL*
of
the
acknowledged
necessity
for
renunciation
,
was
too
fresh
a
misery
*NL*
for
him
to
resign
himself
to
it
and
go
straightway
into
a
distance
*NL*
which
was
also
despair
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
he
did
nothing
more
decided
than
taking
the
Riverston
coach
.
He
*NL*
came
back
again
by
it
while
it
was
still
daylight
,
having
made
up
his
*NL*
mind
that
he
must
go
to
Lydgate
's
that
evening
.
The
Rubicon
,
we
know
,
*NL*
was
a
very
insignificant
stream
to
look
at
;
its
significance
lay
*NL*
entirely
in
certain
invisible
conditions
.
Will
felt
as
if
he
were
*NL*
forced
to
cross
his
small
boundary
ditch
,
and
what
he
saw
beyond
it
was
*NL*
not
empire
,
but
discontented
subjection
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
is
given
to
us
sometimes
even
in
our
every-day
life
to
witness
*NL*
the
saving
influence
of
a
noble
nature
,
the
divine
efficacy
of
rescue
*NL*
that
may
lie
in
a
self-subduing
act
of
fellowship
.
If
Dorothea
,
after
*NL*
her
night
's
anguish
,
had
not
taken
that
walk
to
Rosamond
--
why
,
she
*NL*
perhaps
would
have
been
a
woman
who
gained
a
higher
character
for
*NL*
discretion
,
but
it
would
certainly
not
have
been
as
well
for
those
*NL*
three
who
were
on
one
hearth
in
Lydgate
's
house
at
half-past
seven
that
*NL*
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rosamond
had
been
prepared
for
Will
's
visit
,
and
she
received
him
with
*NL*
a
languid
coldness
which
Lydgate
accounted
for
by
her
nervous
*NL*
exhaustion
,
of
which
he
could
not
suppose
that
it
had
any
relation
to
*NL*
Will
.
And
when
she
sat
in
silence
bending
over
a
bit
of
work
,
he
*NL*
innocently
apologized
for
her
in
an
indirect
way
by
begging
her
to
lean
*NL*
backward
and
rest
.
Will
was
miserable
in
the
necessity
for
playing
the
*NL*
part
of
a
friend
who
was
making
his
first
appearance
and
greeting
to
*NL*
Rosamond
,
while
his
thoughts
were
busy
about
her
feeling
since
that
*NL*
scene
of
yesterday
,
which
seemed
still
inexorably
to
enclose
them
both
,
*NL*
like
the
painful
vision
of
a
double
madness
.
It
happened
that
nothing
*NL*
called
Lydgate
out
of
the
room
;
but
when
Rosamond
poured
out
the
tea
,
*NL*
and
Will
came
near
to
fetch
it
,
she
placed
a
tiny
bit
of
folded
paper
*NL*
in
his
saucer
.
He
saw
it
and
secured
it
quickly
,
but
as
he
went
back
*NL*
to
his
inn
he
had
no
eagerness
to
unfold
the
paper
.
What
Rosamond
had
*NL*
written
to
him
would
probably
deepen
the
painful
impressions
of
the
*NL*
evening
.
Still
,
he
opened
and
read
it
by
his
bed-candle
.
There
were
*NL*
only
these
few
words
in
her
neatly
flowing
hand
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
told
Mrs.
Casaubon
.
She
is
not
under
any
mistake
about
you
.
I
*NL*
told
her
because
she
came
to
see
me
and
was
very
kind
.
You
will
have
*NL*
nothing
to
reproach
me
with
now
.
I
shall
not
have
made
any
difference
*NL*
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
effect
of
these
words
was
not
quite
all
gladness
.
As
Will
dwelt
on
*NL*
them
with
excited
imagination
,
he
felt
his
cheeks
and
ears
burning
at
*NL*
the
thought
of
what
had
occurred
between
Dorothea
and
Rosamond
--
at
the
*NL*
uncertainty
how
far
Dorothea
might
still
feel
her
dignity
wounded
in
*NL*
having
an
explanation
of
his
conduct
offered
to
her
.
There
might
still
*NL*
remain
in
her
mind
a
changed
association
with
him
which
made
an
*NL*
irremediable
difference
--
a
lasting
flaw
.
With
active
fancy
he
wrought
*NL*
himself
into
a
state
of
doubt
little
more
easy
than
that
of
the
man
who
*NL*
has
escaped
from
wreck
by
night
and
stands
on
unknown
ground
in
the
*NL*
darkness
.
Until
that
wretched
yesterday
--
except
the
moment
of
*NL*
vexation
long
ago
in
the
very
same
room
and
in
the
very
same
*NL*
presence
--
all
their
vision
,
all
their
thought
of
each
other
,
had
been
*NL*
as
in
a
world
apart
,
where
the
sunshine
fell
on
tall
white
lilies
,
*NL*
where
no
evil
lurked
,
and
no
other
soul
entered
.
But
now
--
would
*NL*
Dorothea
meet
him
in
that
world
again
?

DR.
DONNE
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
second
morning
after
Dorothea
's
visit
to
Rosamond
,
she
had
had
*NL*
two
nights
of
sound
sleep
,
and
had
not
only
lost
all
traces
of
fatigue
,
*NL*
but
felt
as
if
she
had
a
great
deal
of
superfluous
strength
--
that
is
*NL*
to
say
,
more
strength
than
she
could
manage
to
concentrate
on
any
*NL*
occupation
.
The
day
before
,
she
had
taken
long
walks
outside
the
*NL*
grounds
,
and
had
paid
two
visits
to
the
Parsonage
;
but
she
never
in
her
*NL*
life
told
any
one
the
reason
why
she
spent
her
time
in
that
fruitless
*NL*
manner
,
and
this
morning
she
was
rather
angry
with
herself
for
her
*NL*
childish
restlessness
.
To-day
was
to
be
spent
quite
differently
.
What
*NL*
was
there
to
be
done
in
the
village
?
Oh
dear
!
nothing
.
Everybody
was
*NL*
well
and
had
flannel
;
nobody
's
pig
had
died
;
and
it
was
Saturday
*NL*
morning
,
when
there
was
a
general
scrubbing
of
doors
and
door-stones
,
*NL*
and
when
it
was
useless
to
go
into
the
school
.
But
there
were
various
*NL*
subjects
that
Dorothea
was
trying
to
get
clear
upon
,
and
she
resolved
*NL*
to
throw
herself
energetically
into
the
gravest
of
all
.
She
sat
down
*NL*
in
the
library
before
her
particular
little
heap
of
books
on
political
*NL*
economy
and
kindred
matters
,
out
of
which
she
was
trying
to
get
light
*NL*
as
to
the
best
way
of
spending
money
so
as
not
to
injure
one
's
*NL*
neighbors
,
or
--
what
comes
to
the
same
thing
--
so
as
to
do
them
the
most
*NL*
good
.
Here
was
a
weighty
subject
which
,
if
she
could
but
lay
hold
of
*NL*
it
,
would
certainly
keep
her
mind
steady
.
Unhappily
her
mind
slipped
*NL*
off
it
for
a
whole
hour
;
and
at
the
end
she
found
herself
reading
*NL*
sentences
twice
over
with
an
intense
consciousness
of
many
things
,
but
*NL*
not
of
any
one
thing
contained
in
the
text
.
This
was
hopeless
.
Should
*NL*
she
order
the
carriage
and
drive
to
Tipton
?
No
;
for
some
reason
or
*NL*
other
she
preferred
staying
at
Lowick
.
But
her
vagrant
mind
must
be
*NL*
reduced
to
order
:
there
was
an
art
in
self-discipline
;
and
she
walked
*NL*
round
and
round
the
brown
library
considering
by
what
sort
of
manoeuvre
*NL*
she
could
arrest
her
wandering
thoughts
.
Perhaps
a
mere
task
was
the
*NL*
best
means
--
something
to
which
she
must
go
doggedly
.
Was
there
not
the
*NL*
geography
of
Asia
Minor
,
in
which
her
slackness
had
often
been
rebuked
*NL*
by
Mr.
Casaubon
?
She
went
to
the
cabinet
of
maps
and
unrolled
one
:
*NL*
this
morning
she
might
make
herself
finally
sure
that
Paphlagonia
was
*NL*
not
on
the
Levantine
coast
,
and
fix
her
total
darkness
about
the
*NL*
Chalybes
firmly
on
the
shores
of
the
Euxine
.
A
map
was
a
fine
thing
to
*NL*
study
when
you
were
disposed
to
think
of
something
else
,
being
made
up
*NL*
of
names
that
would
turn
into
a
chime
if
you
went
back
upon
them
.
*NL*
Dorothea
set
earnestly
to
work
,
bending
close
to
her
map
,
and
uttering
*NL*
the
names
in
an
audible
,
subdued
tone
,
which
often
got
into
a
chime
.
*NL*
She
looked
amusingly
girlish
after
all
her
deep
experience
--
nodding
*NL*
her
head
and
marking
the
names
off
on
her
fingers
,
with
a
little
*NL*
pursing
of
her
lip
,
and
now
and
then
breaking
off
to
put
her
hands
on
*NL*
each
side
of
her
face
and
say
,
``
Oh
dear
!
oh
dear
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
reason
why
this
should
end
any
more
than
a
merry-go-round
;
*NL*
but
it
was
at
last
interrupted
by
the
opening
of
the
door
and
the
*NL*
announcement
of
Miss
Noble
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
little
old
lady
,
whose
bonnet
hardly
reached
Dorothea
's
shoulder
,
*NL*
was
warmly
welcomed
,
but
while
her
hand
was
being
pressed
she
made
many
*NL*
of
her
beaver-like
noises
,
as
if
she
had
something
difficult
to
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
sit
down
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
rolling
a
chair
forward
.
``
Am
I
wanted
*NL*
for
anything
?
I
shall
be
so
glad
if
I
can
do
anything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
not
stay
,
''
said
Miss
Noble
,
putting
her
hand
into
her
small
*NL*
basket
,
and
holding
some
article
inside
it
nervously
;
``
I
have
left
a
*NL*
friend
in
the
churchyard
.
''
She
lapsed
into
her
inarticulate
sounds
,
*NL*
and
unconsciously
drew
forth
the
article
which
she
was
fingering
.
It
*NL*
was
the
tortoise-shell
lozenge-box
,
and
Dorothea
felt
the
color
*NL*
mounting
to
her
cheeks
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Ladislaw
,
''
continued
the
timid
little
woman
.
``
He
fears
he
has
*NL*
offended
you
,
and
has
begged
me
to
ask
if
you
will
see
him
for
a
few
*NL*
minutes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
did
not
answer
on
the
instant
:
it
was
crossing
her
mind
that
*NL*
she
could
not
receive
him
in
this
library
,
where
her
husband
's
*NL*
prohibition
seemed
to
dwell
.
She
looked
towards
the
window
.
Could
she
*NL*
go
out
and
meet
him
in
the
grounds
?
The
sky
was
heavy
,
and
the
trees
*NL*
had
begun
to
shiver
as
at
a
coming
storm
.
Besides
,
she
shrank
from
*NL*
going
out
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
see
him
,
Mrs.
Casaubon
,
''
said
Miss
Noble
,
pathetically
;
``
else
I
*NL*
must
go
back
and
say
No
,
and
that
will
hurt
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
will
see
him
,
''
said
Dorothea
.
``
Pray
tell
him
to
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
What
else
was
there
to
be
done
?
There
was
nothing
that
she
longed
for
*NL*
at
that
moment
except
to
see
Will
:
the
possibility
of
seeing
him
had
*NL*
thrust
itself
insistently
between
her
and
every
other
object
;
and
yet
*NL*
she
had
a
throbbing
excitement
like
an
alarm
upon
her
--
a
sense
that
*NL*
she
was
doing
something
daringly
defiant
for
his
sake
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
little
lady
had
trotted
away
on
her
mission
,
Dorothea
stood
in
*NL*
the
middle
of
the
library
with
her
hands
falling
clasped
before
her
,
*NL*
making
no
attempt
to
compose
herself
in
an
attitude
of
dignified
*NL*
unconsciousness
.
What
she
was
least
conscious
of
just
then
was
her
own
*NL*
body
:
she
was
thinking
of
what
was
likely
to
be
in
Will
's
mind
,
and
of
*NL*
the
hard
feelings
that
others
had
had
about
him
.
How
could
any
duty
*NL*
bind
her
to
hardness
?
Resistance
to
unjust
dispraise
had
mingled
with
*NL*
her
feeling
for
him
from
the
very
first
,
and
now
in
the
rebound
of
her
*NL*
heart
after
her
anguish
the
resistance
was
stronger
than
ever
.
``
If
I
*NL*
love
him
too
much
it
is
because
he
has
been
used
so
ill
:
''
--
there
was
a
*NL*
voice
within
her
saying
this
to
some
imagined
audience
in
the
library
,
*NL*
when
the
door
was
opened
,
and
she
saw
Will
before
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
move
,
and
he
came
towards
her
with
more
doubt
and
timidity
*NL*
in
his
face
than
she
had
ever
seen
before
.
He
was
in
a
state
of
*NL*
uncertainty
which
made
him
afraid
lest
some
look
or
word
of
his
should
*NL*
condemn
him
to
a
new
distance
from
her
;
and
Dorothea
was
afraid
of
her
*NL*
_
own
_
emotion
.
She
looked
as
if
there
were
a
spell
upon
her
,
keeping
*NL*
her
motionless
and
hindering
her
from
unclasping
her
hands
,
while
some
*NL*
intense
,
grave
yearning
was
imprisoned
within
her
eyes
.
Seeing
that
*NL*
she
did
not
put
out
her
hand
as
usual
,
Will
paused
a
yard
from
her
and
*NL*
said
with
embarrassment
,
``
I
am
so
grateful
to
you
for
seeing
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wanted
to
see
you
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
having
no
other
words
at
command
.
*NL*
It
did
not
occur
to
her
to
sit
down
,
and
Will
did
not
give
a
cheerful
*NL*
interpretation
to
this
queenly
way
of
receiving
him
;
but
he
went
on
to
*NL*
say
what
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
fear
you
think
me
foolish
and
perhaps
wrong
for
coming
back
so
soon
.
*NL*
I
have
been
punished
for
my
impatience
.
You
know
--
every
one
knows
*NL*
now
--
a
painful
story
about
my
parentage
.
I
knew
of
it
before
I
went
*NL*
away
,
and
I
always
meant
to
tell
you
of
it
if
--
if
we
ever
met
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
slight
movement
in
Dorothea
,
and
she
unclasped
her
hands
,
*NL*
but
immediately
folded
them
over
each
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
the
affair
is
matter
of
gossip
now
,
''
Will
continued
.
``
I
wished
*NL*
you
to
know
that
something
connected
with
it
--
something
which
happened
*NL*
before
I
went
away
,
helped
to
bring
me
down
here
again
.
At
least
I
*NL*
thought
it
excused
my
coming
.
It
was
the
idea
of
getting
Bulstrode
to
*NL*
apply
some
money
to
a
public
purpose
--
some
money
which
he
had
thought
*NL*
of
giving
me
.
Perhaps
it
is
rather
to
Bulstrode
's
credit
that
he
*NL*
privately
offered
me
compensation
for
an
old
injury
:
he
offered
to
give
*NL*
me
a
good
income
to
make
amends
;
but
I
suppose
you
know
the
*NL*
disagreeable
story
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Will
looked
doubtfully
at
Dorothea
,
but
his
manner
was
gathering
some
*NL*
of
the
defiant
courage
with
which
he
always
thought
of
this
fact
in
his
*NL*
destiny
.
He
added
,
``
You
know
that
it
must
be
altogether
painful
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
yes
--
I
know
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
hastily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
not
choose
to
accept
an
income
from
such
a
source
.
I
was
sure
*NL*
that
you
would
not
think
well
of
me
if
I
did
so
,
''
said
Will
.
Why
*NL*
should
he
mind
saying
anything
of
that
sort
to
her
now
?
She
knew
that
*NL*
he
had
avowed
his
love
for
her
.
``
I
felt
that
''
--
he
broke
off
,
*NL*
nevertheless
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
acted
as
I
should
have
expected
you
to
act
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
her
*NL*
face
brightening
and
her
head
becoming
a
little
more
erect
on
its
*NL*
beautiful
stem
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
not
believe
that
you
would
let
any
circumstance
of
my
birth
*NL*
create
a
prejudice
in
you
against
me
,
though
it
was
sure
to
do
so
in
*NL*
others
,
''
said
Will
,
shaking
his
head
backward
in
his
old
way
,
and
*NL*
looking
with
a
grave
appeal
into
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
it
were
a
new
hardship
it
would
be
a
new
reason
for
me
to
cling
to
*NL*
you
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
fervidly
.
``
Nothing
could
have
changed
me
but
--
''
*NL*
her
heart
was
swelling
,
and
it
was
difficult
to
go
on
;
she
made
a
great
*NL*
effort
over
herself
to
say
in
a
low
tremulous
voice
,
``
but
thinking
that
*NL*
you
were
different
--
not
so
good
as
I
had
believed
you
to
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
sure
to
believe
me
better
than
I
am
in
everything
but
one
,
''
*NL*
said
Will
,
giving
way
to
his
own
feeling
in
the
evidence
of
hers
.
``
I
*NL*
mean
,
in
my
truth
to
you
.
When
I
thought
you
doubted
of
that
,
I
did
n't
*NL*
care
about
anything
that
was
left
.
I
thought
it
was
all
over
with
me
,
*NL*
and
there
was
nothing
to
try
for
--
only
things
to
endure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
doubt
you
any
longer
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
putting
out
her
hand
;
a
*NL*
vague
fear
for
him
impelling
her
unutterable
affection
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
her
hand
and
raised
it
to
his
lips
with
something
like
a
sob
.
*NL*
But
he
stood
with
his
hat
and
gloves
in
the
other
hand
,
and
might
have
*NL*
done
for
the
portrait
of
a
Royalist
.
Still
it
was
difficult
to
loose
*NL*
the
hand
,
and
Dorothea
,
withdrawing
it
in
a
confusion
that
distressed
*NL*
her
,
looked
and
moved
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
See
how
dark
the
clouds
have
become
,
and
how
the
trees
are
tossed
,
''
*NL*
she
said
,
walking
towards
the
window
,
yet
speaking
and
moving
with
only
*NL*
a
dim
sense
of
what
she
was
doing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Will
followed
her
at
a
little
distance
,
and
leaned
against
the
tall
*NL*
back
of
a
leather
chair
,
on
which
he
ventured
now
to
lay
his
hat
and
*NL*
gloves
,
and
free
himself
from
the
intolerable
durance
of
formality
to
*NL*
which
he
had
been
for
the
first
time
condemned
in
Dorothea
's
presence
.
*NL*
It
must
be
confessed
that
he
felt
very
happy
at
that
moment
leaning
on
*NL*
the
chair
.
He
was
not
much
afraid
of
anything
that
she
might
feel
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
stood
silent
,
not
looking
at
each
other
,
but
looking
at
the
*NL*
evergreens
which
were
being
tossed
,
and
were
showing
the
pale
underside
*NL*
of
their
leaves
against
the
blackening
sky
.
Will
never
enjoyed
the
*NL*
prospect
of
a
storm
so
much
:
it
delivered
him
from
the
necessity
of
*NL*
going
away
.
Leaves
and
little
branches
were
hurled
about
,
and
the
*NL*
thunder
was
getting
nearer
.
The
light
was
more
and
more
sombre
,
but
*NL*
there
came
a
flash
of
lightning
which
made
them
start
and
look
at
each
*NL*
other
,
and
then
smile
.
Dorothea
began
to
say
what
she
had
been
*NL*
thinking
of
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
was
a
wrong
thing
for
you
to
say
,
that
you
would
have
had
nothing
*NL*
to
try
for
.
If
we
had
lost
our
own
chief
good
,
other
people
's
good
*NL*
would
remain
,
and
that
is
worth
trying
for
.
Some
can
be
happy
.
I
*NL*
seemed
to
see
that
more
clearly
than
ever
,
when
I
was
the
most
*NL*
wretched
.
I
can
hardly
think
how
I
could
have
borne
the
trouble
,
if
*NL*
that
feeling
had
not
come
to
me
to
make
strength
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
never
felt
the
sort
of
misery
I
felt
,
''
said
Will
;
``
the
misery
*NL*
of
knowing
that
you
must
despise
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
have
felt
worse
--
it
was
worse
to
think
ill
--
''
Dorothea
had
begun
*NL*
impetuously
,
but
broke
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
Will
colored
.
He
had
the
sense
that
whatever
she
said
was
uttered
in
*NL*
the
vision
of
a
fatality
that
kept
them
apart
.
He
was
silent
a
moment
,
*NL*
and
then
said
passionately
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
may
at
least
have
the
comfort
of
speaking
to
each
other
without
*NL*
disguise
.
Since
I
must
go
away
--
since
we
must
always
be
divided
--
you
*NL*
may
think
of
me
as
one
on
the
brink
of
the
grave
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
he
was
speaking
there
came
a
vivid
flash
of
lightning
which
lit
*NL*
each
of
them
up
for
the
other
--
and
the
light
seemed
to
be
the
terror
of
*NL*
a
hopeless
love
.
Dorothea
darted
instantaneously
from
the
window
;
Will
*NL*
followed
her
,
seizing
her
hand
with
a
spasmodic
movement
;
and
so
they
*NL*
stood
,
with
their
hands
clasped
,
like
two
children
,
looking
out
on
the
*NL*
storm
,
while
the
thunder
gave
a
tremendous
crack
and
roll
above
them
,
*NL*
and
the
rain
began
to
pour
down
.
Then
they
turned
their
faces
towards
*NL*
each
other
,
with
the
memory
of
his
last
words
in
them
,
and
they
did
not
*NL*
loose
each
other
's
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
no
hope
for
me
,
''
said
Will
.
``
Even
if
you
loved
me
as
well
as
*NL*
I
love
you
--
even
if
I
were
everything
to
you
--
I
shall
most
likely
*NL*
always
be
very
poor
:
on
a
sober
calculation
,
one
can
count
on
nothing
*NL*
but
a
creeping
lot
.
It
is
impossible
for
us
ever
to
belong
to
each
*NL*
other
.
It
is
perhaps
base
of
me
to
have
asked
for
a
word
from
you
.
I
*NL*
meant
to
go
away
into
silence
,
but
I
have
not
been
able
to
do
what
I
*NL*
meant
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
be
sorry
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
in
her
clear
tender
tones
.
``
I
would
*NL*
rather
share
all
the
trouble
of
our
parting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
lips
trembled
,
and
so
did
his
.
It
was
never
known
which
lips
were
*NL*
the
first
to
move
towards
the
other
lips
;
but
they
kissed
tremblingly
,
*NL*
and
then
they
moved
apart
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
rain
was
dashing
against
the
window-panes
as
if
an
angry
spirit
*NL*
were
within
it
,
and
behind
it
was
the
great
swoop
of
the
wind
;
it
was
*NL*
one
of
those
moments
in
which
both
the
busy
and
the
idle
pause
with
a
*NL*
certain
awe
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
sat
down
on
the
seat
nearest
to
her
,
a
long
low
ottoman
in
the
*NL*
middle
of
the
room
,
and
with
her
hands
folded
over
each
other
on
her
*NL*
lap
,
looked
at
the
drear
outer
world
.
Will
stood
still
an
instant
*NL*
looking
at
her
,
then
seated
himself
beside
her
,
and
laid
his
hand
on
*NL*
hers
,
which
turned
itself
upward
to
be
clasped
.
They
sat
in
that
way
*NL*
without
looking
at
each
other
,
until
the
rain
abated
and
began
to
fall
*NL*
in
stillness
.
Each
had
been
full
of
thoughts
which
neither
of
them
*NL*
could
begin
to
utter
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
when
the
rain
was
quiet
,
Dorothea
turned
to
look
at
Will
.
With
*NL*
passionate
exclamation
,
as
if
some
torture
screw
were
threatening
him
,
*NL*
he
started
up
and
said
,
``
It
is
impossible
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
and
leaned
on
the
back
of
the
chair
again
,
and
seemed
to
be
*NL*
battling
with
his
own
anger
,
while
she
looked
towards
him
sadly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
as
fatal
as
a
murder
or
any
other
horror
that
divides
people
,
''
*NL*
he
burst
out
again
;
``
it
is
more
intolerable
--
to
have
our
life
maimed
by
*NL*
petty
accidents
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
do
n't
say
that
--
your
life
need
not
be
maimed
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
*NL*
gently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
must
,
''
said
Will
,
angrily
.
``
It
is
cruel
of
you
to
speak
in
*NL*
that
way
--
as
if
there
were
any
comfort
.
You
may
see
beyond
the
misery
*NL*
of
it
,
but
I
do
n't
.
It
is
unkind
--
it
is
throwing
back
my
love
for
you
*NL*
as
if
it
were
a
trifle
,
to
speak
in
that
way
in
the
face
of
the
fact
.
*NL*
We
can
never
be
married
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Some
time
--
we
might
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
in
a
trembling
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
?
''
said
Will
,
bitterly
.
``
What
is
the
use
of
counting
on
any
*NL*
success
of
mine
?
It
is
a
mere
toss
up
whether
I
shall
ever
do
more
*NL*
than
keep
myself
decently
,
unless
I
choose
to
sell
myself
as
a
mere
pen
*NL*
and
a
mouthpiece
.
I
can
see
that
clearly
enough
.
I
could
not
offer
*NL*
myself
to
any
woman
,
even
if
she
had
no
luxuries
to
renounce
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
silence
.
Dorothea
's
heart
was
full
of
something
that
she
*NL*
wanted
to
say
,
and
yet
the
words
were
too
difficult
.
She
was
wholly
*NL*
possessed
by
them
:
at
that
moment
debate
was
mute
within
her
.
And
it
*NL*
was
very
hard
that
she
could
not
say
what
she
wanted
to
say
.
Will
was
*NL*
looking
out
of
the
window
angrily
.
If
he
would
have
looked
at
her
and
*NL*
not
gone
away
from
her
side
,
she
thought
everything
would
have
been
*NL*
easier
.
At
last
he
turned
,
still
resting
against
the
chair
,
and
*NL*
stretching
his
hand
automatically
towards
his
hat
,
said
with
a
sort
of
*NL*
exasperation
,
``
Good-by
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
can
not
bear
it
--
my
heart
will
break
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
starting
*NL*
from
her
seat
,
the
flood
of
her
young
passion
bearing
down
all
the
*NL*
obstructions
which
had
kept
her
silent
--
the
great
tears
rising
and
*NL*
falling
in
an
instant
:
``
I
do
n't
mind
about
poverty
--
I
hate
my
wealth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
an
instant
Will
was
close
to
her
and
had
his
arms
round
her
,
but
she
*NL*
drew
her
head
back
and
held
his
away
gently
that
she
might
go
on
*NL*
speaking
,
her
large
tear-filled
eyes
looking
at
his
very
simply
,
while
*NL*
she
said
in
a
sobbing
childlike
way
,
``
We
could
live
quite
well
on
my
*NL*
own
fortune
--
it
is
too
much
--
seven
hundred
a-year

I
want
so
little

no
*NL*
new
clothes

I
will
learn
what
everything

The

*NL*
*NL*
It
was
just
after
the
Lords
had
thrown
out
the
Reform
Bill
:
that
*NL*
explains
how
Mr.
Cadwallader
came
to
be
walking
on
the
slope
of
the
*NL*
lawn
near
the
great
conservatory
at
Freshitt
Hall
,
holding
the
``
Times
''
*NL*
in
his
hands
behind
him
,
while
he
talked
with
a
trout-fisher
's
*NL*
dispassionateness
about
the
prospects
of
the
country
to
Sir
James
*NL*
Chettam
.
Mrs.
Cadwallader
,
the
Dowager
Lady
Chettam
,
and
Celia
were
*NL*
sometimes
seated
on
garden-chairs
,
sometimes
walking
to
meet
little
*NL*
Arthur
,
who
was
being
drawn
in
his
chariot
,
and
,
as
became
the
*NL*
infantine
Bouddha
,
was
sheltered
by
his
sacred
umbrella
with
handsome
*NL*
silken
fringe
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
ladies
also
talked
politics
,
though
more
fitfully
.
Mrs.
*NL*
Cadwallader
was
strong
on
the
intended
creation
of
peers
:
she
had
it
*NL*
for
certain
from
her
cousin
that
Truberry
had
gone
over
to
the
other
*NL*
side
entirely
at
the
instigation
of
his
wife
,
who
had
scented
peerages
*NL*
in
the
air
from
the
very
first
introduction
of
the
Reform
question
,
and
*NL*
would
sign
her
soul
away
to
take
precedence
of
her
younger
sister
,
who
*NL*
had
married
a
baronet
.
Lady
Chettam
thought
that
such
conduct
was
very
*NL*
reprehensible
,
and
remembered
that
Mrs.
Truberry
's
mother
was
a
Miss
*NL*
Walsingham
of
Melspring
.
Celia
confessed
it
was
nicer
to
be
``
Lady
''
*NL*
than
``
Mrs.
,
''
and
that
Dodo
never
minded
about
precedence
if
she
could
*NL*
have
her
own
way
.
Mrs.
Cadwallader
held
that
it
was
a
poor
*NL*
satisfaction
to
take
precedence
when
everybody
about
you
knew
that
you
*NL*
had
not
a
drop
of
good
blood
in
your
veins
;
and
Celia
again
,
stopping
*NL*
to
look
at
Arthur
,
said
,
``
It
would
be
very
nice
,
though
,
if
he
were
a
*NL*
Viscount
--
and
his
lordship
's
little
tooth
coming
through
!
He
might
*NL*
have
been
,
if
James
had
been
an
Earl
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Celia
,
''
said
the
Dowager
,
``
James
's
title
is
worth
far
more
*NL*
than
any
new
earldom

I
never
wished
his
father
to
be
anything
else
*NL*
than
Sir
James

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
only
meant
about
Arthur
's
little
tooth

said
Celia
,
*NL*
comfortably
.
``
But
see
,
here
is
my
uncle
coming
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
tripped
off
to
meet
her
uncle
,
while
Sir
James
and
Mr.
Cadwallader
*NL*
came
forward
to
make
one
group
with
the
ladies
.
Celia
had
slipped
her
*NL*
arm
through
her
uncle
's
,
and
he
patted
her
hand
with
a
rather
*NL*
melancholy
``
Well
,
my
dear
!
''
As
they
approached
,
it
was
evident
that
*NL*
Mr.
Brooke
was
looking
dejected
,
but
this
was
fully
accounted
for
by
*NL*
the
state
of
politics
;
and
as
he
was
shaking
hands
all
round
without
*NL*
more
greeting
than
a
``
Well
,
you
're
all
here
,
you
know
,
''
the
Rector
*NL*
said
,
laughingly
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
take
the
throwing
out

Bill

ah

''
said
Mr.
Brooke
,
with
a
mild
distractedness
of
*NL*
manner
.
``
Thrown
out
,
you
know
,
eh
?
The
Lords
are
going
too
far

They

have
to
pull
up

Sad

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
matter

said
Sir
James
.
``
Not
another
gamekeeper
shot

hope

It
's
what
I
should
expect

when
a

Trapping
Bass
is
*NL*
let
off
so
easily

*NL*
*NL*
``
Gamekeeper

No

go
in

I
can
tell
you
all
in

said
Mr.
Brooke
,
nodding
at
the
Cadwalladers
,
to
show
that
he
*NL*
included
them
in
his
confidence
.
``
As
to
poachers
like
Trapping
Bass
,
*NL*
you
know
,

,
''
he
continued
,
as
they
were
entering
,
``
when
you
are
*NL*
a
magistrate
,
you
'll
not
find
it
so
easy
to
commit

Severity
is
all
*NL*
very
well
,
but
it
's
a
great
deal
easier
when
you
've
got
somebody
to
do
*NL*
it
for
you
.
You
have
a
soft
place
in
your
heart
yourself

you
*NL*
know

you
're
not
a
Draco

a
Jeffreys
,
that
sort
of
thing

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Brooke
was
evidently
in
a
state
of
nervous
perturbation
.
When
he
*NL*
had
something
painful
to
tell
,
it
was
usually
his
way
to
introduce
it
*NL*
among
a
number
of
disjointed
particulars
,
as
if
it
were
a
medicine
that
*NL*
would
get
a
milder
flavor
by
mixing
.
He
continued
his
chat
with
Sir
*NL*
James
about
the
poachers
until
they
were
all
seated
,
and
Mrs.
*NL*
Cadwallader
,
impatient
of
this
drivelling
,
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
dying
to
know
the
sad
news

The
gamekeeper
is
not
shot

What
is
it

then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
it
's
a
very
trying
thing

you
know

said
Mr.
Brooke
.
``
I
'm
glad
*NL*
you

Here
Mr.

looked
at
Celia

There

they
come
round

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
must
be
about
Dodo

said
Celia
,
who
had
been
used
to
think
of
her
*NL*
sister
as
the
dangerous
part
of
the
family
machinery
.
She
had
seated
*NL*
herself
on
a
low
stool
against
her
husband
's
knee
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
God
's

Sir

.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
know

Chettam

I
could

sort
of
will
to
make

worse

*NL*
*NL*
``
Exactly

hastily

Mr.

*NL*
nodding
towards
Celia
,
who
immediately
looked
up
at
her
husband
with
a
*NL*
frightened
glance
,
and
put
her
hand
on
his
knee
.
Sir
James
was
almost
*NL*
white
with
anger
,
but
he
did
not
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Merciful

said
Mrs.
Cadwallader
.
``
Not

*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Brooke
nodded
,
saying
,
``
Yes
;
to
Ladislaw

''
and
then
fell
into
a
*NL*
prudential
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see

''
said
Mrs.
Cadwallader
,
waving
her
arm
towards
her
*NL*
husband
.
``
Another
time
you
will
admit
that
I
have
some
foresight
;
or
*NL*
rather
you
will
contradict
me
and
be
just
as
blind
as
ever
.
_
You
_
*NL*
supposed
that
the
young
gentleman
was
gone
out
of
the
country

*NL*
*NL*
``
So
he
might
be

come
back

said
the
Rector
,
quietly
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
did
you
learn
this
?

said
Sir
James
,
not
liking
to
hear
any
one
*NL*
else
speak
,
though
finding
it
difficult
to
speak
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yesterday

said
Mr.
Brooke
,
meekly
.
``
I
went
to
Lowick

Dorothea

neither

But
Dorothea
is
quite
determined

no

I
put
it
strongly
to
her

I
did
my

But
she
can
act

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
have
been
better
if
I
had
called
him
out
and
shot
him
a
year
*NL*
ago

said
Sir
James
,
not
from
bloody-mindedness
,
but
because
he
needed
*NL*
something
strong
to
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
,
James
,
that
would
have
been
very
disagreeable

said
Celia

*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
reasonable

Look
at
the

more
quietly

said
Mr.

Cadwallader
,
sorry
to
see
his
good-natured
friend
so
overmastered
by
*NL*
anger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
not
so
very
easy
for
a
man

any
dignity

said
Sir

James
,
still
in
his
white
indignation

It
is
perfectly
scandalous

he
would
have
gone
out

the

country
at
once
,
and
never
shown
his
face
in
it
again
.
However
,
I
am
*NL*
not
surprised

The
day
after
Casaubon

funeral
I
said
what
ought
to

:
he
had
his

He
was

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

said
Sir

,
unable
to
repress
a
retort
,
``
it
is
rather
a
pity

being

We
are

that
for
seeing

a
woman
like
Dorothea

herself
by
marrying
him

''
Sir
James
*NL*
made
little
stoppages
between
his
clauses
,
the
words
not
coming
easily
.
*NL*
``
A
man
so
marked
out
by

forbidden

seeing
him
again

who
takes
her
out

her
proper

rank
--
into
poverty
--
has
the
meanness
to
accept
such
a
sacrifice
--
has
*NL*
always
had
an
objectionable
position

a
bad
origin

and
,
I
_
believe
_
,
*NL*
is
a
man
of
little
principle

light
character

That
is
my
opinion
.
''
*NL*
Sir
James
ended
emphatically
,
turning
aside
and
crossing
his
leg
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
pointed
everything
out
to
her
,
''
said
Mr.
Brooke
,
apologetically
--
``
I
*NL*
mean
the
poverty

I

kind

go
amongst
people

you
are

I
put
it
strongly
to
her
.
But
I
advise
you
to
talk
to
*NL*
Dorothea
herself
.
The
fact
is
,
she
has
a
dislike
to
Casaubon
's
*NL*
property
.
You
will
hear
what
she
says
,
you
know

*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
excuse
me

I
shall
not
,

said
Sir
James
,
with
more
coolness
.
``
I
*NL*
can
not
bear
to
see
her
again
;
it
is
too
painful
.
It
hurts
me
too
much
*NL*
that
a
woman
like
Dorothea
should
have
done
what
is
wrong
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
just
,
Chettam
,
''
said
the
easy
,
large-lipped
Rector
,
who
objected
to
*NL*
all
this
unnecessary
discomfort
.
``
Mrs.
Casaubon
may
be
acting
*NL*
imprudently
:
she
is
giving
up
a
fortune
for
the
sake
of
a
man
,
and
we
*NL*
men
have
so
poor
an
opinion
of
each
other
that
we
can
hardly
call
a
*NL*
woman
wise
who
does
that
.
But
I
think
you
should
not
condemn
it
as
a
*NL*
wrong
action
,
in
the
strict
sense
of
the
word
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
do
,
''
answered
Sir
James
.
``
I
think
that
Dorothea
commits
a
*NL*
wrong
action
in
marrying
Ladislaw
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
fellow
,
we
are
rather
apt
to
consider
an
act
wrong
because
it
*NL*
is
unpleasant
to
us
,
''
said
the
Rector
,
quietly
.
Like
many
men
who
take
*NL*
life
easily
,
he
had
the
knack
of
saying
a
home
truth
occasionally
to
*NL*
those
who
felt
themselves
virtuously
out
of
temper
.
Sir
James
took
out
*NL*
his
handkerchief
and
began
to
bite
the
corner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
very
dreadful
of
Dodo
,
though
,
''
said
Celia
,
wishing
to
justify
*NL*
her
husband
.
``
She
said
she
_
never
would
_
marry
again
--
not
anybody
at
*NL*
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
heard
her
say
the
same
thing
myself
,
''
said
Lady
Chettam
,
*NL*
majestically
,
as
if
this
were
royal
evidence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
there
is
usually
a
silent
exception
in
such
cases
,
''
said
Mrs.
*NL*
Cadwallader
.
``
The
only
wonder
to
me
is
,
that
any
of
you
are
surprised
.
*NL*
You
did
nothing
to
hinder
it
.
If
you
would
have
had
Lord
Triton
down
*NL*
here
to
woo
her
with
his
philanthropy
,
he
might
have
carried
her
off
*NL*
before
the
year
was
over
.
There
was
no
safety
in
anything
else
.
Mr.
*NL*
Casaubon
had
prepared
all
this
as
beautifully
as
possible
.
He
made
*NL*
himself
disagreeable
--
or
it
pleased
God
to
make
him
so
--
and
then
he
*NL*
dared
her
to
contradict
him
.
It
's
the
way
to
make
any
trumpery
*NL*
tempting
,
to
ticket
it
at
a
high
price
in
that
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
what
you
mean
by
wrong

Cadwallader

''
said
Sir
James
,
*NL*
still
feeling
a
little
stung
,
and
turning
round
in
his
chair
towards
*NL*
the
Rector
.
``
He
's
not
a
man
we
can
take
into
the
family
.
At
least
,
I
*NL*
must
speak
for
myself
,
''
he
continued
,
carefully
keeping
his
eyes
off
*NL*
Mr.
Brooke
.
``
I
suppose
others
will
find
his
society
too
pleasant
to
*NL*
care
about
the
propriety
of
the
thing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
know
,
Chettam
,
''
said
Mr.
Brooke
,
good-humoredly
,
nursing
his
*NL*
leg
,
``
I
ca
n't
turn
my
back
on
Dorothea
.
I
must
be
a
father
to
her
up
*NL*
to
a
certain
point
.
I
said
,
`
My
dear
,
I
wo
n't
refuse
to
give
you
*NL*
away
.
'
I
had
spoken
strongly
before
.
But
I
can
cut
off
the
entail
,
*NL*
you
know
.
It
will
cost
money
and
be
troublesome
;
but
I
can
do
it
,
you
*NL*
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Brooke
nodded
at
Sir
James
,
and
felt
that
he
was
both
showing
his
*NL*
own
force
of
resolution
and
propitiating
what
was
just
in
the
Baronet
's
*NL*
vexation
.
He
had
hit
on
a
more
ingenious
mode
of
parrying
than
he
was
*NL*
aware
of
.
He
had
touched
a
motive
of
which
Sir
James
was
ashamed
.
The
*NL*
mass
of
his
feeling
about
Dorothea
's
marriage
to
Ladislaw
was
due
*NL*
partly
to
excusable
prejudice
,
or
even
justifiable
opinion
,
partly
to
a
*NL*
jealous
repugnance
hardly
less
in
Ladislaw
's
case
than
in
Casaubon
's
.
*NL*
He
was
convinced
that
the
marriage
was
a
fatal
one
for
Dorothea
.
But
*NL*
amid
that
mass
ran
a
vein
of
which
he
was
too
good
and
honorable
a
man
*NL*
to
like
the
avowal
even
to
himself
:
it
was
undeniable
that
the
union
of
*NL*
the
two
estates
--
Tipton
and
Freshitt
--
lying
charmingly
within
a
*NL*
ring-fence
,
was
a
prospect
that
flattered
him
for
his
son
and
heir
.
*NL*
Hence
when
Mr.
Brooke
noddingly
appealed
to
that
motive
,
Sir
James
felt
*NL*
a
sudden
embarrassment
;
there
was
a
stoppage
in
his
throat
;
he
even
*NL*
blushed
.
He
had
found
more
words
than
usual
in
the
first
jet
of
his
*NL*
anger
,
but
Mr.
Brooke
's
propitiation
was
more
clogging
to
his
tongue
*NL*
than
Mr.
Cadwallader
's
caustic
hint
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Celia
was
glad
to
have
room
for
speech
after
her
uncle
's
suggestion
*NL*
of
the
marriage
ceremony
,
and
she
said
,
though
with
as
little
eagerness
*NL*
of
manner
as
if
the
question
had
turned
on
an
invitation
to
dinner
,
``
Do
*NL*
you
mean
that
Dodo
is
going
to
be
married
directly
,
uncle
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
three
weeks
,
you
know
,
''
said
Mr.
Brooke
,
helplessly
.
``
I
can
do
*NL*
nothing
to
hinder
it
,
Cadwallader
,
''
he
added
,
turning
for
a
little
*NL*
countenance
toward
the
Rector
,
who
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
''
--
I
--
should
not
make
any
fuss
about
it
.
If
she
likes
to

poor

that
*NL*
is
her
affair
.
Nobody
would
have
said
anything
if
she
had
married
the
*NL*
young
fellow
because
he
was
rich

Plenty
of
beneficed
clergy
are
*NL*
poorer
than
they
will
be

Here
is
Elinor
,

continued
the
provoking
*NL*
husband
;
``
she
vexed
her
friends
by
me
:
I
had
hardly
a
thousand
*NL*
a-year

I
was
a
lout

nobody
could
see
anything
in
me
--
my
shoes
were
*NL*
not
the
right
cut
--
all
the
men
wondered
how
a
woman
could
like
me
.
*NL*
Upon
my
word
,
I
must
take
Ladislaw
's
part
until
I
hear
more
harm
of
*NL*
him
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Humphrey

that
is
all
sophistry

and
you
know
it

said
his
wife
.
*NL*
``
Everything
is
all
one
--
that
is
the
beginning
and
end
with
you

As
if
*NL*
you
had
not
been
a
Cadwallader
!
Does
any
one
suppose
that
I
would
have
*NL*
taken
such
a
monster
as
you
by
any
other
name
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
a
clergyman
too
,
''
observed
Lady
Chettam
with
approbation
.
``
Elinor
*NL*
can
not
be
said
to
have
descended
below
her
rank

It
is
difficult
to
*NL*
say
what
Mr.
Ladislaw
is
,
eh
,
James
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
James
gave
a
small
grunt
,
which
was
less
respectful
than
his
usual
*NL*
mode
of
answering
his
mother
.
Celia
looked
up
at
him
like
a
thoughtful
*NL*
kitten
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
must
be
admitted
that
his
blood
is
a
frightful
mixture
!

said
Mrs.
*NL*
Cadwallader
.
``
The
Casaubon
cuttle-fish
fluid
to
begin
with
,
and
then
a
*NL*
rebellious
Polish
fiddler

it

then
an
old

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
the

*NL*
*NL*
``
After
all

said
Mrs.
Cadwallader
,
rising
too
,
*NL*
and
wishing
to
make
amends
.
``
He
is
like
the
fine
old
Crichley
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
go

Mr.

,
starting
up
with
alacrity

*NL*
*NL*
``
You

,
taking
her
husband
's
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
of
course
,
if
you
like

said
Sir
James
,
pulling
down
his
*NL*
waistcoat
,
but
unable
yet
to
adjust
his
face
good-humoredly
.
``
That
is
*NL*
to
say

it
is
not

:
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

no

said
Mr.

,
understanding
the
condition

*NL*

When
Sir
James
and
Celia
were
alone
,
she
said
,
``
Do
you
mind
about

*NL*

``

he
answered
,
with
some
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

*NL*
*NL*
``

Sir

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
What

however

*NL*
I
'll
tell

bring

''
*NL*
*NL*
Celia
thought
it
was
of
great
use
,
if
not
to
say
that
,
at
least
to
take
*NL*
a
journey
to
Lowick
in
order
to
influence
Dorothea
's
mind
.
All
through
*NL*
their
girlhood
she
had
felt
that
she
could
act
on
her
sister
by
a
word
*NL*
judiciously
placed
--
by
opening
a
little
window
for
the
daylight
of
her
*NL*
own
understanding
to
enter
among
the
strange
colored
lamps
by
which
*NL*
Dodo
habitually
saw
.
And
Celia
the
matron
naturally
felt
more
able
to
*NL*
advise
her
childless
sister
.
How
could
any
one
understand
Dodo
so
well
*NL*
as
Celia
did
or
love
her
so
tenderly
?
*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
,
busy
in
her
boudoir
,
felt
a
glow
of
pleasure
at
the
sight
of
*NL*
her
sister
so
soon
after
the
revelation
of
her
intended
marriage
.
She
*NL*
had
prefigured
to
herself
,
even
with
exaggeration
,
the
disgust
of
her
*NL*
friends
,
and
she
had
even
feared
that
Celia
might
be
kept
aloof
from
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
Kitty
,
I
am
delighted
to
see
you
!
''
said
Dorothea
,
putting
her
hands
*NL*
on
Celia
's
shoulders
,
and
beaming
on
her
.
``
I
almost
thought
you
would
*NL*
not
come
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
not
brought
Arthur
,
because
I
was
in
a
hurry

said
Celia
,
and
*NL*
they
sat
down
on
two
small
chairs
opposite
each
other
,
with
their
knees
*NL*
touching
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
,
Dodo
,
it
is
very
bad
,
''
said
Celia
,
in
her
placid
guttural
,
*NL*
looking
as
prettily
free
from
humors
as
possible
.
``
You
have
*NL*
disappointed
us
all
so
.
And
I
ca
n't
think
that
it
ever

will
_
be
--
you
*NL*
never
can
go
and
live
in
that
way
.
And
then
there
are
all
your
plans
!
*NL*
You
never
can
have
thought
of
that
.
James
would
have
taken
any
trouble
*NL*
for
you
,
and
you
might
have
gone
on
all
your
life
doing
what
you
liked
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
contrary
,
dear
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
``
I
never
could
do
anything
that
*NL*
I
liked
.
I
have
never
carried
out
any
plan
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
you
always
wanted
things
that

But
other

come

how
can
you
marry
Mr.
Ladislaw
,
that
we
none
of
*NL*
us
ever
thought
you
_
could
_
marry
?
It
shocks
James
so
dreadfully
.
And
*NL*
then
it
is
all
so
different
from
what
you
have
always
been
.
You
would
*NL*
have
Mr.
Casaubon
because
he
had
such
a
great
soul
,
and
was
so
and
*NL*
dismal
and
learned
;
and
now
,
to
think
of
marrying
Mr.
Ladislaw
,
who
has
*NL*
got
no
estate
or
anything
.
I
suppose
it
is
because
you
must
be
making
*NL*
yourself
uncomfortable
in
some
way
or
other
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
it
is
very
serious
,
Dodo
,
''
said
Celia
,
becoming
more
impressive
.
*NL*
``
How
will
you
live
?
and
you
will
go
away
among
queer
people
.
And
I
*NL*
shall
never
see
you
--
and
you
wo
n't
mind
about
little
Arthur

I
*NL*
thought
you
always
would

*NL*
*NL*
Celia
's
rare
tears
had
got
into
her
eyes
,
and
the
corners
of
her
mouth
*NL*
were
agitated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
Celia

''
said
Dorothea
,
with
tender
gravity
,
``
if
you
do
n't
ever

me

it
will
not
be
my
fault

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
will

''
said
Celia
,
with
the
same
touching
distortion
of
her
*NL*
small
features
.
``
How
can
I
come
to
you

have
you
with
me
when
James
*NL*
ca
n't
bear
it

that
is
because
he
thinks
it
is
not
right

he
thinks
*NL*
you
are
so
wrong
,
Dodo
.
But
you
always
were
wrong
:
only
I
ca
n't
help
*NL*
loving
you

And
nobody
can
think
where
you
will
live
:
where
can
you
*NL*
go
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
going
to
London

said
Dorothea
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
you
always
live
in
a
street
?
And
you
will
be
so
poor

I
*NL*
could
give
you
half
my
things

only
how
can
I

when
I
never

*NL*
*NL*
``
Bless

Kitty

said
Dorothea
,
with
gentle
warmth
.
``
Take
comfort
:
*NL*
perhaps
James
will
forgive
me
some
time

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
would
be
much
better
if
you
would
not
be
married

''
said
Celia
,
*NL*
drying
her
eyes
,
and
returning
to
her
argument
;
``
then
there
would
be
*NL*
nothing
uncomfortable

And
you
would
not
do
what
nobody
thought
you
*NL*
could
do

James
always
said
you
ought
to
be
a
queen
;
but
this
is
not
*NL*
at
all
being
like
a
queen
.
You
know
what
mistakes
you
have
always
been
*NL*
making
,
Dodo
,
and
this
is
another
.
Nobody
thinks
Mr.
Ladislaw
a
proper
*NL*
husband
for
you
.
And
you
_
said
you
_
would
never
be
married
again

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
quite
true
that
I
might
be
a
wiser
person
,
Celia
,
''
said
*NL*
Dorothea
,
``
and
that
I
might
have
done
something
better
,
if
I

been
*NL*
better

But
this
is
what
I
am
going

do

I

promised
to
marry
*NL*
Mr.
Ladislaw

I
am
going

marry

*NL*
*NL*
The
tone
in
which
Dorothea
said
this
was
a
note
that
Celia
had
long
*NL*
learned
to
recognize
.
She
was
silent
a
few
moments
,
and
then
said
,
as
*NL*
if
she
had
dismissed
all
contest
,
``
Is
he
very
fond
of
you

Dodo
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
so

am

*NL*
*NL*
``
That

said
Celia
,
comfortably
.
``
Only
I
rather

had
such
a
*NL*
sort
of
husband
as
James
is

with
a
place
very
near

that
I
could
drive
*NL*
to

''
*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
smiled
,
and
Celia
looked
rather
meditative
.
Presently
she
*NL*
said
,
``
I
can
not
think
how
it
all
came
about

Celia
thought
it
would
be
*NL*
pleasant
to
hear
the
story

*NL*
*NL*
``

said-Dorothea

pinching
her
sister

``
If

``
Ca

said
Celia

her

cozily

When
immortal
Bunyan
makes
his
picture
of
the
persecuting
passions
*NL*
bringing
in
their
verdict
of
guilty
,
who
pities
Faithful
?
That
is
a
*NL*
rare
and
blessed
lot
which
some
greatest
men
have
not
attained
,
to
know
*NL*
ourselves
guiltless
before
a
condemning
crowd
--
to
be
sure
that
what
we
*NL*
are
denounced
for
is
solely
the
good
in
us
.
The
pitiable
lot
is
that
*NL*
of
the
man
who
could
not
call
himself
a
martyr
even
though
he
were
to
*NL*
persuade
himself
that
the
men
who
stoned
him
were
but
ugly
passions
*NL*
incarnate
--
who
knows
that
he
is
stoned
,
not
for
professing
the
Right
,
*NL*
but
for
not
being
the
man
he
professed
to
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
consciousness
that
Bulstrode
was
withering
under
while
he
*NL*
made
his
preparations
for
departing
from
Middlemarch
,
and
going
to
end
*NL*
his
stricken
life
in
that
sad
refuge
,
the
indifference
of
new
faces
.
*NL*
The
duteous
merciful
constancy
of
his
wife
had
delivered
him
from
one
*NL*
dread
,
but
it
could
not
hinder
her
presence
from
being
still
a
tribunal
*NL*
before
which
he
shrank
from
confession
and
desired
advocacy
.
His
*NL*
equivocations
with
himself
about
the
death
of
Raffles
had
sustained
the
*NL*
conception
of
an
Omniscience
whom
he
prayed
to
,
yet
he
had
a
terror
*NL*
upon
him
which
would
not
let
him
expose
them
to
judgment
by
a
full
*NL*
confession
to
his
wife
:
the
acts
which
he
had
washed
and
diluted
with
*NL*
inward
argument
and
motive
,
and
for
which
it
seemed
comparatively
easy
*NL*
to
win
invisible
pardon
--
what
name
would
she
call
them
by
?
That
she
*NL*
should
ever
silently
call
his
acts
Murder
was
what
he
could
not
bear
.
*NL*
He
felt
shrouded
by
her
doubt
:
he
got
strength
to
face
her
from
the
*NL*
sense
that
she
could
not
yet
feel
warranted
in
pronouncing
that
worst
*NL*
condemnation
on
him
.
Some
time
,
perhaps
--
when
he
was
dying
--
he
would
*NL*
tell
her
all
:
in
the
deep
shadow
of
that
time
,
when
she
held
his
hand
*NL*
in
the
gathering
darkness
,
she
might
listen
without
recoiling
from
his
*NL*
touch
.
Perhaps
:
but
concealment
had
been
the
habit
of
his
life
,
and
*NL*
the
impulse
to
confession
had
no
power
against
the
dread
of
a
deeper
*NL*
humiliation
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
full
of
timid
care
for
his
wife
,
not
only
because
he
deprecated
*NL*
any
harshness
of
judgment
from
her
,
but
because
he
felt
a
deep
distress
*NL*
at
the
sight
of
her
suffering
.
She
had
sent
her
daughters
away
to
*NL*
board
at
a
school
on
the
coast
,
that
this
crisis
might
be
hidden
from
*NL*
them
as
far
as
possible
.
Set
free
by
their
absence
from
the
*NL*
intolerable
necessity
of
accounting
for
her
grief
or
of
beholding
their
*NL*
frightened
wonder
,
she
could
live
unconstrainedly
with
the
sorrow
that
*NL*
was
every
day
streaking
her
hair
with
whiteness
and
making
her
eyelids
*NL*
languid
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
anything
that
you
would
like
to
have
me
do
,
Harriet
,
''
*NL*
Bulstrode
had
said
to
her
;
``
I
mean
with
regard
to
arrangements
of
*NL*
property
.
It
is
my
intention
not
to
sell
the
land
I
possess
in
this
*NL*
neighborhood
,
but
to
leave
it
to
you
as
a
safe
provision
.
If
you
have
*NL*
any
wish
on
such
subjects
,
do
not
conceal
it
from
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
days
afterwards
,
when
she
had
returned
from
a
visit
to
her
*NL*
brother
's
,
she
began
to
speak
to
her
husband
on
a
subject
which
had
for
*NL*
some
time
been
in
her
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
_
should
_
like
to
do
something
for
my
brother
's
family
,
Nicholas
;
and
*NL*
I
think
we
are
bound
to
make
some
amends
to
Rosamond
and
her
husband
.
*NL*
Walter
says
Mr.
Lydgate
must
leave
the
town
,
and
his
practice
is
almost
*NL*
good
for
nothing
,
and
they
have
very
little
left
to
settle
anywhere
*NL*
with
.
I
would
rather
do
without
something
for
ourselves
,
to
make
some
*NL*
amends
to
my
poor
brother
's
family
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Bulstrode
did
not
wish
to
go
nearer
to
the
facts
than
in
the
*NL*
phrase
``
make
some
amends
;
''
knowing
that
her
husband
must
understand
*NL*
her
.
He
had
a
particular
reason
,
which
she
was
not
aware
of
,
for
*NL*
wincing
under
her
suggestion
.
He
hesitated
before
he
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
not
possible
to
carry
out
your
wish
in
the
way
you
propose
,
my
*NL*
dear
.
Mr.
Lydgate
has
virtually
rejected
any
further
service
from
me
.
*NL*
He
has
returned
the
thousand
pounds
which
I
lent
him
.
Mrs.
Casaubon
*NL*
advanced
him
the
sum
for
that
purpose
.
Here
is
his
letter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
letter
seemed
to
cut
Mrs.
Bulstrode
severely
.
The
mention
of
Mrs.
*NL*
Casaubon
's
loan
seemed
a
reflection
of
that
public
feeling
which
held
*NL*
it
a
matter
of
course
that
every
one
would
avoid
a
connection
with
her
*NL*
husband
.
She
was
silent
for
some
time
;
and
the
tears
fell
one
after
*NL*
the
other
,
her
chin
trembling
as
she
wiped
them
away
.
Bulstrode
,
*NL*
sitting
opposite
to
her
,
ached
at
the
sight
of
that
grief-worn
face
,
*NL*
which
two
months
before
had
been
bright
and
blooming
.
It
had
aged
to
*NL*
keep
sad
company
with
his
own
withered
features
.
Urged
into
some
*NL*
effort
at
comforting
her
,
he
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
another
means
,
Harriet
,
by
which
I
might
do
a
service
to
your
*NL*
brother
's
family
,
if
you
like
to
act
in
it
.
And
it
would
,
I
think
,
be
*NL*
beneficial
to
you
:
it
would
be
an
advantageous
way
of
managing
the
land
*NL*
which
I
mean
to
be
yours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
attentive
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Garth
once
thought
of
undertaking
the
management
of
Stone
Court
in
*NL*
order
to
place
your
nephew
Fred
there
.
The
stock
was
to
remain
as
it
*NL*
is
,
and
they
were
to
pay
a
certain
share
of
the
profits
instead
of
an
*NL*
ordinary
rent
.
That
would
be
a
desirable
beginning
for
the
young
man
,
*NL*
in
conjunction
with
his
employment
under
Garth
.
Would
it
be
a
*NL*
satisfaction
to
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
would
,
''
said
Mrs.
Bulstrode
,
with
some
return
of
energy
.
*NL*
``
Poor
Walter
is
so
cast
down
;
I
would
try
anything
in
my
power
to
do
*NL*
him
some
good
before
I
go
away
.
We
have
always
been
brother
and
*NL*
sister
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
make
the
proposal
to
Garth
yourself
,
Harriet
,
''
said
Mr.
*NL*
Bulstrode
,
not
liking
what
he
had
to
say
,
but
desiring
the
end
he
had
*NL*
in
view
,
for
other
reasons
besides
the
consolation
of
his
wife
.
``
You
*NL*
must
state
to
him
that
the
land
is
virtually
yours
,
and
that
he
need
*NL*
have
no
transactions
with
me
.
Communications
can
be
made
through
*NL*
Standish
.
I
mention
this
,
because
Garth
gave
up
being
my
agent
.
I
can
*NL*
put
into
your
hands
a
paper
which
he
himself
drew
up
,
stating
*NL*
conditions
;
and
you
can
propose
his
renewed
acceptance
of
them
.
I
*NL*
think
it
is
not
unlikely
that
he
will
accept
when
you
propose
the
thing
*NL*
for
the
sake
of
your
nephew

*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Garth
,
hearing
Caleb
enter
the
passage
about
tea-time
,
opened
the
*NL*
parlor-door
and
said
,
``
There
you
are
,
Caleb
.
Have
you
had
your

dinner

-LRB-
Mr.

meals
were
much
subordinated
to

-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

,
a
good
dinner

cold

said
Mrs.

Garth
,
seeing
that
her
absent-minded
husband
was
putting
on
again
the
*NL*
hat
which
he
had
just
taken
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
;
I
'm
only
going
to
Mary
a
minute
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
was
in
a
grassy
corner
of
the
garden
,
where
there
was
a
swing
*NL*
loftily
hung
between
two
pear-trees
.
She
had
a
pink
kerchief
tied
over
*NL*
her
head
,
making
a
little
poke
to
shade
her
eyes
from
the
level
*NL*
sunbeams
,
while
she
was
giving
a
glorious
swing
to
Letty
,
who
laughed
*NL*
and
screamed
wildly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Seeing
her
father
,
Mary
left
the
swing
and
went
to
meet
him
,
pushing
*NL*
back
the
pink
kerchief
and
smiling
afar
off
at
him
with
the
involuntary
*NL*
smile
of
loving
pleasure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
came
to
look
for
you
,
Mary
,
''
said
Mr.
Garth
.
``
Let
us
walk
about
a
*NL*
bit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
knew
quite
well
that
her
father
had
something
particular
to
say
:
*NL*
his
eyebrows
made
their
pathetic
angle
,
and
there
was
a
tender
gravity
*NL*
in
his
voice
:
these
things
had
been
signs
to
her
when
she
was
Letty
's
*NL*
age
.
She
put
her
arm
within
his
,
and
they
turned
by
the
row
of
*NL*
nut-trees
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
will
be
a
sad
while
before
you
can
be
married
,
Mary
,
''
said
her
*NL*
father
,
not
looking
at
her
,
but
at
the
end
of
the
stick
which
he
held
*NL*
in
his
other
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
a
sad
while
,
father
--
I
mean
to
be
merry
,

said
Mary
,
laughingly
.
*NL*
``
I
have
been
single
and
merry
for
four-and-twenty
years
and
more
:
I
*NL*
suppose
it
will
not
be
quite
as
long
again
as
that
.
''
Then
,
after
a
*NL*
little
pause
,
she
said
,
more
gravely
,
bending
her
face
before
her
*NL*
father
's
,
``
If
you
are
contented
with
Fred
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Caleb
screwed
up
his
mouth
and
turned
his
head
aside
wisely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
father
,
you
did
praise
him
last
Wednesday

You
said
he
had
an

uncommon
notion

stock

and
a
good
eye
for
things

*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
I
?

Caleb

rather
slyly

*NL*

put
it
all
down

Mary
.
``
You
like
things
to
be
neatly
booked

And
then
his
*NL*
behavior
to
you
,
father
,
is
really
good
;
he
has
a
deep
respect
for
you
;
*NL*
and
it
is
impossible
to
have
a
better
temper
than
Fred
has

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay

you
want

coax

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

I
do

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
for

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

always
loved

I
should
never

well

that

a
point

*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
mind
is
quite
settled

Caleb

returning
to
his

first
tone

``
There

late

-LRB-
Caleb
meant
a
great
deal
in
that
*NL*
vague
phrase
;-RRB-
``
because
,
better
late
than
never

A
woman
must
not
*NL*
force
her
heart

she

do

man
no
good
by
that

*NL*
*NL*
``
My
feelings
have
not
changed

said
Mary
,
calmly
.
``
I
shall
be
*NL*
constant
to
Fred
as
long

constant

I
do

either

of
us
could
spare
the
other

like
any
one
else
better

however
much
*NL*
we
might
admire
them

It
would
make
too
great
a
difference
to
us

like
*NL*
seeing
all
the
old
places
altered

and
changing
the
name

everything

We
must
wait
for
each
other
a
long
while

Fred
knows

that

*NL*
*NL*
Instead
of
speaking
immediately
,
Caleb
stood
still
and
screwed
his
*NL*
stick
on
the
grassy
walk
.
Then
he
said
,
with
emotion
in
his
voice
,
*NL*
``
Well

I
've
got
a
bit

there

*NL*
``
How
can

wonderingly

*NL*

He
would
manage

praying

She
wants
to
do
the

good

and
it
might
be
*NL*
a
fine
thing
for
him

With
saving

he
might
gradually
buy
the
stock

and
he
has
a
turn
for
farming

``
Oh

turning
his

warningly

take
it
on

my

that
will
grieve
your

a

she
may

so

had
need
be
careful

*NL*
``
Perhaps
it
is

much

checked
in

here
Caleb

voice
shook
just
*NL*
perceptibly
,

wanted
to
tell

tell

After

I

could
talk
it
well

``
Oh

good

cried
Mary

putting
her
hands
round
her

father

neck

while
he
bent
his
head
placidly

willing
to
be
caressed

said
Mary

Fred
*NL*
stood
still
and
raised
his
hat
to
her
with
playful
formality
.

You

*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
that
is
too
bad

Mary

said
Fred

``
Just
look
at
the
edges
of
*NL*
these
coat-cuffs

It
is
only
by
dint
of
good
brushing

turning
to

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

One
lives

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have

*NL*
``

That
would
leave
you
time
to
misbehave

and
*NL*
then
if
I
liked
some
one
else
better

I
should
have
an
excuse
for

jilting
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pray
do
n't
joke

Mary

''
said
Fred
,
with
strong
feeling
.
``
Tell
me
*NL*
seriously
that
all

Mary
,
in
a
tone
of
obedient
recitation

*NL*
*NL*
They
lingered
on
the
door-step
under
the
steep-roofed
porch
,
and
Fred
*NL*
almost
in
a
whisper
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
we
were
first
engaged
,
with
the
umbrella-ring
,
Mary
,
you
used
*NL*
to

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
spirit
of
joy
began
to
laugh
more
decidedly
in
Mary
's
eyes
,
but
the
*NL*
fatal
Ben
came
running
to
the
door
with
Brownie
yapping
behind
him
,
*NL*
and
,
bouncing
against
them
,
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fred

Mary

are
you
ever
coming
in

may
I
eat

*NL*
*NL*
FINALE
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Every
limit
is
a
beginning
as
well
as
an
ending
.
Who
can
quit
young
*NL*
lives
after
being
long
in
company
with
them
,
and
not
desire
to
know
*NL*
what
befell
them
in
their
after-years
?
For
the
fragment
of
a
life
,
*NL*
however
typical
,
is
not
the
sample
of
an
even
web
:
promises
may
not
be
*NL*
kept
,
and
an
ardent
outset
may
be
followed
by
declension
;
latent
powers
*NL*
may
find
their
long-waited
opportunity
;
a
past
error
may
urge
a
grand
*NL*
retrieval
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marriage
,
which
has
been
the
bourne
of
so
many
narratives
,
is
still
a
*NL*
great
beginning
,
as
it
was
to
Adam
and
Eve
,
who
kept
their
honeymoon
in
*NL*
Eden
,
but
had
their
first
little
one
among
the
thorns
and
thistles
of
*NL*
the
wilderness
.
It
is
still
the
beginning
of
the
home
epic
--
the
*NL*
gradual
conquest
or
irremediable
loss
of
that
complete
union
which
*NL*
makes
the
advancing
years
a
climax
,
and
age
the
harvest
of
sweet
*NL*
memories
in
common
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
set
out
,
like
Crusaders
of
old
,
with
a
glorious
equipment
of
hope
*NL*
and
enthusiasm
and
get
broken
by
the
way
,
wanting
patience
with
each
*NL*
other
and
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
who
have
cared
for
Fred
Vincy
and
Mary
Garth
will
like
to
know
that
*NL*
these
two
made
no
such
failure
,
but
achieved
a
solid
mutual
happiness
.
*NL*
Fred
surprised
his
neighbors
in
various
ways
.
He
became
rather
*NL*
distinguished
in
his
side
of
the
county
as
a
theoretic
and
practical
*NL*
farmer
,
and
produced
a
work
on
the
``
Cultivation
of
Green
Crops
and
the
*NL*
Economy
of
Cattle-Feeding
''
which
won
him
high
congratulations
at
*NL*
agricultural
meetings
.
In
Middlemarch
admiration
was
more
reserved
:
*NL*
most
persons
there
were
inclined
to
believe
that
the
merit
of
Fred
's
*NL*
authorship
was
due
to
his
wife
,
since
they
had
never
expected
Fred
*NL*
Vincy
to
write
on
turnips
and
mangel-wurzel
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
when
Mary
wrote
a
little
book
for
her
boys
,
called
``
Stories
of
*NL*
Great
Men
,
taken
from
Plutarch
,
''
and
had
it
printed
and
published
by
*NL*
Gripp
&
Co.
,
Middlemarch
,
every
one
in
the
town
was
willing
to
give
the
*NL*
credit
of
this
work
to
Fred
,
observing
that
he
had
been
to
the
*NL*
University
,
``
where
the
ancients
were
studied
,
''
and
might
have
been
a
*NL*
clergyman
if
he
had
chosen
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
way
it
was
made
clear
that
Middlemarch
had
never
been
deceived
,
*NL*
and
that
there
was
no
need
to
praise
anybody
for
writing
a
book
,
since
*NL*
it
was
always
done
by
somebody
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
Moreover
,
Fred
remained
unswervingly
steady
.
Some
years
after
his
*NL*
marriage
he
told
Mary
that
his
happiness
was
half
owing
to
Farebrother
,
*NL*
who
gave
him
a
strong
pull-up
at
the
right
moment
.
I
can
not
say
that
*NL*
he
was
never
again
misled
by
his
hopefulness
:
the
yield
of
crops
or
the
*NL*
profits
of
a
cattle
sale
usually
fell
below
his
estimate
;
and
he
was
*NL*
always
prone
to
believe
that
he
could
make
money
by
the
purchase
of
a
*NL*
horse
which
turned
out
badly
--
though
this
,
Mary
observed
,
was
of
*NL*
course
the
fault
of
the
horse
,
not
of
Fred
's
judgment
.
He
kept
his
*NL*
love
of
horsemanship
,
but
he
rarely
allowed
himself
a
day
's
hunting
;
*NL*
and
when
he
did
so
,
it
was
remarkable
that
he
submitted
to
be
laughed
*NL*
at
for
cowardliness
at
the
fences
,
seeming
to
see
Mary
and
the
boys
*NL*
sitting
on
the
five-barred
gate
,
or
showing
their
curly
heads
between
*NL*
hedge
and
ditch
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
three
boys
:
Mary
was
not
discontented
that
she
brought
forth
*NL*
men-children
only
;
and
when
Fred
wished
to
have
a
girl
like
her
,
she
*NL*
said
,
laughingly
,
``
that
would
be
too
great
a
trial
to
your
mother
.
''
*NL*
Mrs.
Vincy
in
her
declining
years
,
and
in
the
diminished
lustre
of
her
*NL*
housekeeping
,
was
much
comforted
by
her
perception
that
two
at
least
of
*NL*
Fred
's
boys
were
real
Vincys
,
and
did
not
``
feature
the
Garths
.
''
But
*NL*
Mary
secretly
rejoiced
that
the
youngest
of
the
three
was
very
much
*NL*
what
her
father
must
have
been
when
he
wore
a
round
jacket
,
and
showed
*NL*
a
marvellous
nicety
of
aim
in
playing
at
marbles
,
or
in
throwing
stones
*NL*
to
bring
down
the
mellow
pears
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ben
and
Letty
Garth
,
who
were
uncle
and
aunt
before
they
were
well
in
*NL*
their
teens
,
disputed
much
as
to
whether
nephews
or
nieces
were
more
*NL*
desirable
;
Ben
contending
that
it
was
clear
girls
were
good
for
less
*NL*
than
boys
,
else
they
would
not
be
always
in
petticoats
,
which
showed
*NL*
how
little
they
were
meant
for
;
whereupon
Letty
,
who
argued
much
from
*NL*
books
,
got
angry
in
replying
that
God
made
coats
of
skins
for
both
Adam
*NL*
and
Eve
alike
--
also
it
occurred
to
her
that
in
the
East
the
men
too
*NL*
wore
petticoats
.
But
this
latter
argument
,
obscuring
the
majesty
of
*NL*
the
former
,
was
one
too
many
,
for
Ben
answered
contemptuously
,
``
The
*NL*
more
spooneys
they
!
''
and
immediately
appealed
to
his
mother
whether
*NL*
boys
were
not
better
than
girls
.
Mrs.
Garth
pronounced
that
both
were
*NL*
alike
naughty
,
but
that
boys
were
undoubtedly
stronger
,
could
run
*NL*
faster
,
and
throw
with
more
precision
to
a
greater
distance
.
With
this
*NL*
oracular
sentence
Ben
was
well
satisfied
,
not
minding
the
naughtiness
;
*NL*
but
Letty
took
it
ill
,
her
feeling
of
superiority
being
stronger
than
*NL*
her
muscles
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fred
never
became
rich
--
his
hopefulness
had
not
led
him
to
expect
that
;
*NL*
but
he
gradually
saved
enough
to
become
owner
of
the
stock
and
*NL*
furniture
at
Stone
Court
,
and
the
work
which
Mr.
Garth
put
into
his
*NL*
hands
carried
him
in
plenty
through
those
``
bad
times
''
which
are
always
*NL*
present
with
farmers
.
Mary
,
in
her
matronly
days
,
became
as
solid
in
*NL*
figure
as
her
mother
;
but
,
unlike
her
,
gave
the
boys
little
formal
*NL*
teaching
,
so
that
Mrs.
Garth
was
alarmed
lest
they
should
never
be
well
*NL*
grounded
in
grammar
and
geography
.
Nevertheless
,
they
were
found
quite
*NL*
forward
enough
when
they
went
to
school
;
perhaps
,
because
they
had
*NL*
liked
nothing
so
well
as
being
with
their
mother
.
When
Fred
was
riding
*NL*
home
on
winter
evenings
he
had
a
pleasant
vision
beforehand
of
the
*NL*
bright
hearth
in
the
wainscoted
parlor
,
and
was
sorry
for
other
men
who
*NL*
could
not
have
Mary
for
their
wife
;
especially
for
Mr.
Farebrother
.
*NL*
``
He
was
ten
times
worthier
of
you
than
I
was
,
''
Fred
could
now
say
to
*NL*
her
,
magnanimously
.
``
To
be
sure
he
was
,
''
Mary
answered
;
``
and
for
that
*NL*
reason
he
could
do
better
without
me
.
But
you
--
I
shudder
to
think
what
*NL*
you
would
have
been
--
a
curate
in
debt
for
horse-hire
and
cambric
*NL*
pocket-handkerchiefs
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
inquiry
it
might
possibly
be
found
that
Fred
and
Mary
still
inhabit
*NL*
Stone
Court
--
that
the
creeping
plants
still
cast
the
foam
of
their
*NL*
blossoms
over
the
fine
stone-wall
into
the
field
where
the
walnut-trees
*NL*
stand
in
stately
row
--
and
that
on
sunny
days
the
two
lovers
who
were
*NL*
first
engaged
with
the
umbrella-ring
may
be
seen
in
white-haired
*NL*
placidity
at
the
open
window
from
which
Mary
Garth
,
in
the
days
of
old
*NL*
Peter
Featherstone
,
had
often
been
ordered
to
look
out
for
Mr.
Lydgate
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lydgate
's
hair
never
became
white
.
He
died
when
he
was
only
fifty
,
*NL*
leaving
his
wife
and
children
provided
for
by
a
heavy
insurance
on
his
*NL*
life
.
He
had
gained
an
excellent
practice
,
alternating
,
according
to
*NL*
the
season
,
between
London
and
a
Continental
bathing-place
;
having
*NL*
written
a
treatise
on
Gout
,
a
disease
which
has
a
good
deal
of
wealth
*NL*
on
its
side
.
His
skill
was
relied
on
by
many
paying
patients
,
but
he
*NL*
always
regarded
himself
as
a
failure
:
he
had
not
done
what
he
once
*NL*
meant
to
do
.
His
acquaintances
thought
him
enviable
to
have
so
*NL*
charming
a
wife
,
and
nothing
happened
to
shake
their
opinion
.
Rosamond
*NL*
never
committed
a
second
compromising
indiscretion
.
She
simply
*NL*
continued
to
be
mild
in
her
temper
,
inflexible
in
her
judgment
,
*NL*
disposed
to
admonish
her
husband
,
and
able
to
frustrate
him
by
*NL*
stratagem
.
As
the
years
went
on
he
opposed
her
less
and
less
,
whence
*NL*
Rosamond
concluded
that
he
had
learned
the
value
of
her
opinion
;
on
the
*NL*
other
hand
,
she
had
a
more
thorough
conviction
of
his
talents
now
that
*NL*
he
gained
a
good
income
,
and
instead
of
the
threatened
cage
in
Bride
*NL*
Street
provided
one
all
flowers
and
gilding
,
fit
for
the
bird
of
*NL*
paradise
that
she
resembled
.
In
brief
,
Lydgate
was
what
is
called
a
*NL*
successful
man
.
But
he
died
prematurely
of
diphtheria
,
and
Rosamond
*NL*
afterwards
married
an
elderly
and
wealthy
physician
,
who
took
kindly
to
*NL*
her
four
children
.
She
made
a
very
pretty
show
with
her
daughters
,
*NL*
driving
out
in
her
carriage
,
and
often
spoke
of
her
happiness
as
``
a
*NL*
reward
''
--
she
did
not
say
for
what
,
but
probably
she
meant
that
it
was
a
*NL*
reward
for
her
patience
with
Tertius
,
whose
temper
never
became
*NL*
faultless
,
and
to
the
last
occasionally
let
slip
a
bitter
speech
which
*NL*
was
more
memorable
than
the
signs
he
made
of
his
repentance
.
He
once
*NL*
called
her
his
basil
plant
;
and
when
she
asked
for
an
explanation
,
said
*NL*
that
basil
was
a
plant
which
had
flourished
wonderfully
on
a
murdered
*NL*
man
's
brains
.
Rosamond
had
a
placid
but
strong
answer
to
such
*NL*
speeches
.
Why
then
had
he
chosen
her
?
It
was
a
pity
he
had
not
had
*NL*
Mrs.
Ladislaw
,
whom
he
was
always
praising
and
placing
above
her
.
And
*NL*
thus
the
conversation
ended
with
the
advantage
on
Rosamond
's
side
.
But
*NL*
it
would
be
unjust
not
to
tell
,
that
she
never
uttered
a
word
in
*NL*
depreciation
of
Dorothea
,
keeping
in
religious
remembrance
the
*NL*
generosity
which
had
come
to
her
aid
in
the
sharpest
crisis
of
her
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
herself
had
no
dreams
of
being
praised
above
other
women
,
*NL*
feeling
that
there
was
always
something
better
which
she
might
have
*NL*
done
,
if
she
had
only
been
better
and
known
better
.
Still
,
she
never
*NL*
repented
that
she
had
given
up
position
and
fortune
to
marry
Will
*NL*
Ladislaw
,
and
he
would
have
held
it
the
greatest
shame
as
well
as
*NL*
sorrow
to
him
if
she
had
repented
.
They
were
bound
to
each
other
by
a
*NL*
love
stronger
than
any
impulses
which
could
have
marred
it
.
No
life
*NL*
would
have
been
possible
to
Dorothea
which
was
not
filled
with
emotion
,
*NL*
and
she
had
now
a
life
filled
also
with
a
beneficent
activity
which
she
*NL*
had
not
the
doubtful
pains
of
discovering
and
marking
out
for
herself
.
*NL*
Will
became
an
ardent
public
man
,
working
well
in
those
times
when
*NL*
reforms
were
begun
with
a
young
hopefulness
of
immediate
good
which
has
*NL*
been
much
checked
in
our
days
,
and
getting
at
last
returned
to
*NL*
Parliament
by
a
constituency
who
paid
his
expenses
.
Dorothea
could
*NL*
have
liked
nothing
better
,
since
wrongs
existed
,
than
that
her
husband
*NL*
should
be
in
the
thick
of
a
struggle
against
them
,
and
that
she
should
*NL*
give
him
wifely
help
.
Many
who
knew
her
,
thought
it
a
pity
that
so
*NL*
substantive
and
rare
a
creature
should
have
been
absorbed
into
the
life
*NL*
of
another
,
and
be
only
known
in
a
certain
circle
as
a
wife
and
mother
.
*NL*
But
no
one
stated
exactly
what
else
that
was
in
her
power
she
ought
*NL*
rather
to
have
done
--
not
even
Sir
James
Chettam
,
who
went
no
further
*NL*
than
the
negative
prescription
that
she
ought
not
to
have
married
Will
*NL*
Ladislaw
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
this
opinion
of
his
did
not
cause
a
lasting
alienation
;
and
the
way
*NL*
in
which
the
family
was
made
whole
again
was
characteristic
of
all
*NL*
concerned
.
Mr.
Brooke
could
not
resist
the
pleasure
of
corresponding
*NL*
with
Will
and
Dorothea
;
and
one
morning
when
his
pen
had
been
*NL*
remarkably
fluent
on
the
prospects
of
Municipal
Reform
,
it
ran
off
into
*NL*
an
invitation
to
the
Grange
,
which
,
once
written
,
could
not
be
done
*NL*
away
with
at
less
cost
than
the
sacrifice
-LRB-
hardly
to
be
conceived
-RRB-
of
*NL*
the
whole
valuable
letter
.
During
the
months
of
this
correspondence
*NL*
Mr.
Brooke
had
continually
,
in
his
talk
with
Sir
James
Chettam
,
been
*NL*
presupposing
or
hinting
that
the
intention
of
cutting
off
the
entail
*NL*
was
still
maintained
;
and
the
day
on
which
his
pen
gave
the
daring
*NL*
invitation
,
he
went
to
Freshitt
expressly
to
intimate
that
he
had
a
*NL*
stronger
sense
than
ever
of
the
reasons
for
taking
that
energetic
step
*NL*
as
a
precaution
against
any
mixture
of
low
blood
in
the
heir
of
the
*NL*
Brookes
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
that
morning
something
exciting
had
happened
at
the
Hall
.
A
letter
*NL*
had
come
to
Celia
which
made
her
cry
silently
as
she
read
it
;
and
when
*NL*
Sir
James
,
unused
to
see
her
in
tears
,
asked
anxiously
what
was
the
*NL*
matter
,
she
burst
out
in
a
wail
such
as
he
had
never
heard
from
her
*NL*
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dorothea
has
a
little
boy
.
And
you
will
not
let
me
go
and
see
her
.
*NL*
And
I
am
sure
she
wants
to
see
me
.
And
she
will
not
know
what
to
do
*NL*
with
the
baby
--
she
will
do
wrong
things
with
it
.
And
they
thought
she
*NL*
would
die
.
It
is
very
dreadful
!
Suppose
it
had
been
me
and
little
*NL*
Arthur
,
and
Dodo
had
been
hindered
from
coming
to
see
me
!
I
wish
you
*NL*
would
be
less
unkind
,
James
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
heavens
,
Celia
!
''
said
Sir
James
,
much
wrought
upon
,
``
what
do
you
*NL*
wish
?
I
will
do
anything
you
like
.
I
will
take
you
to
town
to-morrow
*NL*
if
you
wish
it
.
''
And
Celia
did
wish
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
after
this
that
Mr.
Brooke
came
,
and
meeting
the
Baronet
in
the
*NL*
grounds
,
began
to
chat
with
him
in
ignorance
of
the
news
,
which
Sir
*NL*
James
for
some
reason
did
not
care
to
tell
him
immediately
.
But
when
*NL*
the
entail
was
touched
on
in
the
usual
way
,
he
said
,
``
My
dear
sir
,
it
*NL*
is
not
for
me
to
dictate
to
you
,
but
for
my
part
I
would
let
that
*NL*
alone
.
I
would
let
things
remain
as
they
are
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Brooke
felt
so
much
surprised
that
he
did
not
at
once
find
out
how
*NL*
much
he
was
relieved
by
the
sense
that
he
was
not
expected
to
do
*NL*
anything
in
particular
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
being
the
bent
of
Celia
's
heart
,
it
was
inevitable
that
Sir
James
*NL*
should
consent
to
a
reconciliation
with
Dorothea
and
her
husband
.
*NL*
Where
women
love
each
other
,
men
learn
to
smother
their
mutual
dislike
.
*NL*
Sir
James
never
liked
Ladislaw
,
and
Will
always
preferred
to
have
Sir
*NL*
James
's
company
mixed
with
another
kind
:
they
were
on
a
footing
of
*NL*
reciprocal
tolerance
which
was
made
quite
easy
only
when
Dorothea
and
*NL*
Celia
were
present
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
became
an
understood
thing
that
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Ladislaw
should
pay
at
*NL*
least
two
visits
during
the
year
to
the
Grange
,
and
there
came
*NL*
gradually
a
small
row
of
cousins
at
Freshitt
who
enjoyed
playing
with
*NL*
the
two
cousins
visiting
Tipton
as
much
as
if
the
blood
of
these
*NL*
cousins
had
been
less
dubiously
mixed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Brooke
lived
to
a
good
old
age
,
and
his
estate
was
inherited
by
*NL*
Dorothea
's
son
,
who
might
have
represented
Middlemarch
,
but
declined
,
*NL*
thinking
that
his
opinions
had
less
chance
of
being
stifled
if
he
*NL*
remained
out
of
doors
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
James
never
ceased
to
regard
Dorothea
's
second
marriage
as
a
*NL*
mistake
;
and
indeed
this
remained
the
tradition
concerning
it
in
*NL*
Middlemarch
,
where
she
was
spoken
of
to
a
younger
generation
as
a
fine
*NL*
girl
who
married
a
sickly
clergyman
,
old
enough
to
be
her
father
,
and
*NL*
in
little
more
than
a
year
after
his
death
gave
up
her
estate
to
marry
*NL*
his
cousin
--
young
enough
to
have
been
his
son
,
with
no
property
,
and
*NL*
not
well-born
.
Those
who
had
not
seen
anything
of
Dorothea
usually
*NL*
observed
that
she
could
not
have
been
``
a
nice
woman
,
''
else
she
would
*NL*
not
have
married
either
the
one
or
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
Certainly
those
determining
acts
of
her
life
were
not
ideally
*NL*
beautiful
.
They
were
the
mixed
result
of
young
and
noble
impulse
*NL*
struggling
amidst
the
conditions
of
an
imperfect
social
state
,
in
which
*NL*
great
feelings
will
often
take
the
aspect
of
error
,
and
great
faith
the
*NL*
aspect
of
illusion
.
For
there
is
no
creature
whose
inward
being
is
so
*NL*
strong
that
it
is
not
greatly
determined
by
what
lies
outside
it
.
A
*NL*
new
Theresa
will
hardly
have
the
opportunity
of
reforming
a
conventual
*NL*
life
,
any
more
than
a
new
Antigone
will
spend
her
heroic
piety
in
*NL*
daring
all
for
the
sake
of
a
brother
's
burial
:
the
medium
in
which
*NL*
their
ardent
deeds
took
shape
is
forever
gone
.
But
we
insignificant
*NL*
people
with
our
daily
words
and
acts
are
preparing
the
lives
of
many
*NL*
Dorotheas
,
some
of
which
may
present
a
far
sadder
sacrifice
than
that
*NL*
of
the
Dorothea
whose
story
we
know
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
finely
touched
spirit
had
still
its
fine
issues
,
though
they
were
*NL*
not
widely
visible
.
Her
full
nature
,
like
that
river
of
which
Cyrus
*NL*
broke
the
strength
,
spent
itself
in
channels
which
had
no
great
name
on
*NL*
the
earth
.
But
the
effect
of
her
being
on
those
around
her
was
*NL*
incalculably
diffusive
:
for
the
growing
good
of
the
world
is
partly
*NL*
dependent
on
unhistoric
acts
;
and
that
things
are
not
so
ill
with
you
*NL*
and
me
as
they
might
have
been
,
is
half
owing
to
the
number
who
lived
*NL*
faithfully
a
hidden
life
,
and
rest
in
unvisited
tombs
.
