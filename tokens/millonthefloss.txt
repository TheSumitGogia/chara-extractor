Chapter
I
*NL*
*NL*
Outside
Dorlcote
Mill
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
A
wide
plain
,
where
the
broadening
Floss
hurries
on
between
its
green
*NL*
banks
to
the
sea
,
and
the
loving
tide
,
rushing
to
meet
it
,
checks
its
*NL*
passage
with
an
impetuous
embrace
.
On
this
mighty
tide
the
black
*NL*
ships
--
laden
with
the
fresh-scented
fir-planks
,
with
rounded
sacks
of
*NL*
oil-bearing
seed
,
or
with
the
dark
glitter
of
coal
--
are
borne
along
to
*NL*
the
town
of
St.
Ogg
's
,
which
shows
its
aged
,
fluted
red
roofs
and
the
*NL*
broad
gables
of
its
wharves
between
the
low
wooded
hill
and
the
*NL*
river-brink
,
tingeing
the
water
with
a
soft
purple
hue
under
the
*NL*
transient
glance
of
this
February
sun
.
Far
away
on
each
hand
stretch
*NL*
the
rich
pastures
,
and
the
patches
of
dark
earth
made
ready
for
the
*NL*
seed
of
broad-leaved
green
crops
,
or
touched
already
with
the
tint
of
*NL*
the
tender-bladed
autumn-sown
corn
.
There
is
a
remnant
still
of
last
*NL*
year
's
golden
clusters
of
beehive-ricks
rising
at
intervals
beyond
the
*NL*
hedgerows
;
and
everywhere
the
hedgerows
are
studded
with
trees
;
the
*NL*
distant
ships
seem
to
be
lifting
their
masts
and
stretching
their
*NL*
red-brown
sails
close
among
the
branches
of
the
spreading
ash
.
Just
by
*NL*
the
red-roofed
town
the
tributary
Ripple
flows
with
a
lively
current
*NL*
into
the
Floss
.
How
lovely
the
little
river
is
,
with
its
dark
changing
*NL*
wavelets
!
It
seems
to
me
like
a
living
companion
while
I
wander
along
*NL*
the
bank
,
and
listen
to
its
low
,
placid
voice
,
as
to
the
voice
of
one
*NL*
who
is
deaf
and
loving
.
I
remember
those
large
dipping
willows
.
I
*NL*
remember
the
stone
bridge
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
this
is
Dorlcote
Mill
.
I
must
stand
a
minute
or
two
here
on
the
*NL*
bridge
and
look
at
it
,
though
the
clouds
are
threatening
,
and
it
is
*NL*
far
on
in
the
afternoon
.
Even
in
this
leafless
time
of
departing
*NL*
February
it
is
pleasant
to
look
at
,
--
perhaps
the
chill
,
damp
season
*NL*
adds
a
charm
to
the
trimly
kept
,
comfortable
dwelling-house
,
as
old
as
*NL*
the
elms
and
chestnuts
that
shelter
it
from
the
northern
blast
.
The
*NL*
stream
is
brimful
now
,
and
lies
high
in
this
little
withy
plantation
,
*NL*
and
half
drowns
the
grassy
fringe
of
the
croft
in
front
of
the
house
.
*NL*
As
I
look
at
the
full
stream
,
the
vivid
grass
,
the
delicate
*NL*
bright-green
powder
softening
the
outline
of
the
great
trunks
and
*NL*
branches
that
gleam
from
under
the
bare
purple
boughs
,
I
am
in
love
*NL*
with
moistness
,
and
envy
the
white
ducks
that
are
dipping
their
heads
*NL*
far
into
the
water
here
among
the
withes
,
unmindful
of
the
awkward
*NL*
appearance
they
make
in
the
drier
world
above
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
rush
of
the
water
and
the
booming
of
the
mill
bring
a
dreamy
*NL*
deafness
,
which
seems
to
heighten
the
peacefulness
of
the
scene
.
They
*NL*
are
like
a
great
curtain
of
sound
,
shutting
one
out
from
the
world
*NL*
beyond
.
And
now
there
is
the
thunder
of
the
huge
covered
wagon
coming
*NL*
home
with
sacks
of
grain
.
That
honest
wagoner
is
thinking
of
his
*NL*
dinner
,
getting
sadly
dry
in
the
oven
at
this
late
hour
;
but
he
will
*NL*
not
touch
it
till
he
has
fed
his
horses
,
--
the
strong
,
submissive
,
*NL*
meek-eyed
beasts
,
who
,
I
fancy
,
are
looking
mild
reproach
at
him
from
*NL*
between
their
blinkers
,
that
he
should
crack
his
whip
at
them
in
that
*NL*
awful
manner
as
if
they
needed
that
hint
!
See
how
they
stretch
their
*NL*
shoulders
up
the
slope
toward
the
bridge
,
with
all
the
more
energy
*NL*
because
they
are
so
near
home
.
Look
at
their
grand
shaggy
feet
that
*NL*
seem
to
grasp
the
firm
earth
,
at
the
patient
strength
of
their
necks
,
*NL*
bowed
under
the
heavy
collar
,
at
the
mighty
muscles
of
their
*NL*
struggling
haunches
!
I
should
like
well
to
hear
them
neigh
over
their
*NL*
hardly
earned
feed
of
corn
,
and
see
them
,
with
their
moist
necks
freed
*NL*
from
the
harness
,
dipping
their
eager
nostrils
into
the
muddy
pond
.
*NL*
Now
they
are
on
the
bridge
,
and
down
they
go
again
at
a
swifter
pace
,
*NL*
and
the
arch
of
the
covered
wagon
disappears
at
the
turning
behind
the
*NL*
trees
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
I
can
turn
my
eyes
toward
the
mill
again
,
and
watch
the
unresting
*NL*
wheel
sending
out
its
diamond
jets
of
water
.
That
little
girl
is
*NL*
watching
it
too
;
she
has
been
standing
on
just
the
same
spot
at
the
*NL*
edge
of
the
water
ever
since
I
paused
on
the
bridge
.
And
that
queer
*NL*
white
cur
with
the
brown
ear
seems
to
be
leaping
and
barking
in
*NL*
ineffectual
remonstrance
with
the
wheel
;
perhaps
he
is
jealous
because
*NL*
his
playfellow
in
the
beaver
bonnet
is
so
rapt
in
its
movement
.
It
is
*NL*
time
the
little
playfellow
went
in
,
I
think
;
and
there
is
a
very
*NL*
bright
fire
to
tempt
her
:
the
red
light
shines
out
under
the
deepening
*NL*
gray
of
the
sky
.
It
is
time
,
too
,
for
me
to
leave
off
resting
my
arms
*NL*
on
the
cold
stone
of
this
bridge
...
*NL*
*NL*
Ah
,
my
arms
are
really
benumbed
.
I
have
been
pressing
my
elbows
on
the
*NL*
arms
of
my
chair
,
and
dreaming
that
I
was
standing
on
the
bridge
in
*NL*
front
of
Dorlcote
Mill
,
as
it
looked
one
February
afternoon
many
years
*NL*
ago
.
Before
I
dozed
off
,
I
was
going
to
tell
you
what
Mr.
and
Mrs.
*NL*
Tulliver
were
talking
about
,
as
they
sat
by
the
bright
fire
in
the
*NL*
left-hand
parlor
,
on
that
very
afternoon
I
have
been
dreaming
of
.

Chapter
II
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Tulliver
,
of
Dorlcote
Mill
,
Declares
His
Resolution
about
Tom
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
I
want
,
you
know
,
''
said
Mr.
Tulliver
,
--
``
what
I
want
is
to
give
*NL*
Tom
a
good
eddication
;
an
eddication
as
'll
be
a
bread
to
him
.
That
was
*NL*
what
I
was
thinking
of
when
I
gave
notice
for
him
to
leave
the
academy
*NL*
at
Lady-day
.
I
mean
to
put
him
to
a
downright
good
school
at
*NL*
Midsummer
.
The
two
years
at
th
'
academy
`
ud
ha
'
done
well
enough
,
if
*NL*
I
'd
meant
to
make
a
miller
and
farmer
of
him
,
for
he
's
had
a
fine
*NL*
sight
more
schoolin
'
nor
_
I
_
ever
got
.
All
the
learnin
'
_
my
_
father
*NL*
ever
paid
for
was
a
bit
o
'
birch
at
one
end
and
the
alphabet
at
th
'
*NL*
other
.
But
I
should
like
Tom
to
be
a
bit
of
a
scholard
,
so
as
he
might
*NL*
be
up
to
the
tricks
o
'
these
fellows
as
talk
fine
and
write
with
a
*NL*
flourish
.
It
`
ud
be
a
help
to
me
wi
'
these
lawsuits
,
and
arbitrations
,
*NL*
and
things
.
I
would
n't
make
a
downright
lawyer
o
'
the
lad
,
--
I
should
*NL*
be
sorry
for
him
to
be
a
raskill
,
--
but
a
sort
o
'
engineer
,
or
a
*NL*
surveyor
,
or
an
auctioneer
and
vallyer
,
like
Riley
,
or
one
o
'
them
*NL*
smartish
businesses
as
are
all
profits
and
no
outlay
,
only
for
a
big
*NL*
watch-chain
and
a
high
stool
.
They
're
pretty
nigh
all
one
,
and
they
're
*NL*
not
far
off
being
even
wi
'
the
law
,
_
I
_
believe
;
for
Riley
looks
*NL*
Lawyer
Wakem
i
'
the
face
as
hard
as
one
cat
looks
another
.
_
He
's
_
none
*NL*
frightened
at
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Tulliver
was
speaking
to
his
wife
,
a
blond
comely
woman
in
a
*NL*
fan-shaped
cap
-LRB-
I
am
afraid
to
think
how
long
it
is
since
fan-shaped
*NL*
caps
were
worn
,
they
must
be
so
near
coming
in
again
.
At
that
time
,
*NL*
when
Mrs.
Tulliver
was
nearly
forty
,
they
were
new
at
St.
Ogg
's
,
and
*NL*
considered
sweet
things
-RRB-
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Mr.
Tulliver
,
you
know
best
:
_
I
've
_
no
objections
.
But
had
n't
I
*NL*
better
kill
a
couple
o
'
fowl
,
and
have
th
'
aunts
and
uncles
to
dinner
*NL*
next
week
,
so
as
you
may
hear
what
sister
Glegg
and
sister
Pullet
have
*NL*
got
to
say
about
it
?
There
's
a
couple
o
'
fowl
_
wants
_
killing
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
kill
every
fowl
i

the
yard
if
you
like

Bessy
;
but
I
shall
*NL*
ask
neither
aunt
nor
uncle
what
I
'm
to
do
wi
'
my
own
lad
,
''
said
Mr.
*NL*
Tulliver
,
defiantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
heart
!
''
said
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
shocked
at
this
sanguinary
rhetoric
,
*NL*
``
how
can
you
talk
so
,
Mr.
Tulliver
?
But
it
's
your
way
to
speak
*NL*
disrespectful
o
'
my
family
;
and
sister
Glegg
throws
all
the
blame
*NL*
upo
'
me
,
though
I
'm
sure
I
'm
as
innocent
as
the
babe
unborn
.
For
*NL*
nobody
's
ever
heard
me
say
as
it
was
n't
lucky
for
my
children
to
have
*NL*
aunts
and
uncles
as
can
live
independent
.
Howiver
,
if
Tom
's
to
go
to
a
*NL*
new
school
,
I
should
like
him
to
go
where
I
can
wash
him
and
mend
him
;
*NL*
else
he
might
as
well
have
calico
as
linen
,
for
they
'd
be
one
as
*NL*
yallow
as
th
'
other
before
they
'd
been
washed
half-a-dozen
times
.
And
*NL*
then
,
when
the
box
is
goin
'
back
`
ard
and
forrard
,
I
could
send
the
lad
*NL*
a
cake
,
or
a
pork-pie
,
or
an
apple
;
for
he
can
do
with
an
extry
bit
,
*NL*
bless
him
!
whether
they
stint
him
at
the
meals
or
no
.
My
children
can
*NL*
eat
as
much
victuals
as
most
,
thank

*NL*
``
Dear

''
said
Mrs.

in
mild
surprise
,
``
when
did
I
iver
*NL*
make
objections
to

I

I

I

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

Bessy

I
did

niver
mind

it

puzzling

What
I

time
i

summat
else
besides
blacking
the

and

up

thing
to

school
*NL*
to
pick
.

*NL*
Mr.
Tulliver
paused
a
minute
or
two
,
and
dived
with
both
hands
into
*NL*
his
breeches
pockets
as
if
he
hoped
to
find
some
suggestion
there
.
*NL*
Apparently
he
was
not
disappointed
,
for
he
presently
said
,
``
I
know
*NL*
what
I
'll
do
:
I
'll
talk
it
over
wi

Riley
;
he

coming
to-morrow
,
t

*NL*
arbitrate
about
the
dam
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Mr.
Tulliver
,
I
've
put
the
sheets
out
for
the
best
bed
,
and
*NL*
Kezia
's
got
'em
hanging
at
the
fire
.
They
are
n't
the
best
sheets
,
but
*NL*
they
're
good
enough
for
anybody
to
sleep
in
,
be
he
who
he
will
;
for
as
*NL*
for
them
best
Holland
sheets
,
I
should
repent
buying
'em
,
only
they
'll
*NL*
do
to
lay
us
out
in
.
An

if
you
was
to

to-morrow

Mr.

*NL*
they

mangled
beautiful

an

,
an

o

lavender
as

*NL*
`
ud
be
a
pleasure
to
lay

out
;
an
'
they
lie
at
the
left-hand
corner

o

the
big
oak
linen-chest
at

:
not
as
I
should
trust
anybody
*NL*
to
look
'em
out
but
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
Mrs.
Tulliver
uttered
the
last
sentence
,
she
drew
a
bright
bunch
of
*NL*
keys
from
her
pocket
,
and
singled
out
one
,
rubbing
her
thumb
and
*NL*
finger
up
and
down
it
with
a
placid
smile
while
she
looked
at
the
*NL*
clear
fire
.
If
Mr.
Tulliver
had
been
a
susceptible
man
in
his
conjugal
*NL*
relation
,
he
might
have
supposed
that
she
drew
out
the
key
to
aid
her
*NL*
imagination
in
anticipating
the
moment
when
he
would
be
in
a
state
to
*NL*
justify
the
production
of
the
best
Holland
sheets
.
Happily
he
was
not
*NL*
so
;
he
was
only
susceptible
in
respect
of
his
right
to
water-power
;
*NL*
moreover
,
he
had
the
marital
habit
of
not
listening
very
closely
,
and
*NL*
since
his
mention
of
Mr.
Riley
,
had
been
apparently
occupied
in
a
*NL*
tactile
examination
of
his
woollen
stockings
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
've
hit
it
,
Bessy
,
''
was
his
first
remark
after
a
short
*NL*
silence
.
``
Riley
's
as
likely
a
man
as
any
to
know
o
'
some
school
;
he
's
*NL*
had

himself
,
an
'
goes
about
to
all
sorts
o
'
places
,
*NL*
arbitratin

and
vallyin

and
that
.
And
we
shall
have
time
to
talk
it
*NL*
over
to-morrow
night
when
the
business
is
done
.
I
want
Tom
to
be
such
*NL*
a
sort
o

man
as
Riley
,
you
know
,
--
as
can
talk
pretty
nigh
as
well
as
*NL*
if
it
was
all
wrote
out
for
him
,
and
knows
a
good
lot
o
'
words
as
*NL*
do
n't
mean
much
,
so
as
you
ca
n't
lay
hold
of
'em
i
'
law
;
and
a
good
*NL*
solid
knowledge
o
'
business
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
``
so
far
as
talking
proper
,
and
knowing
*NL*
everything
,
and
walking
with
a
bend
in
his

,
and
setting
his
hair
*NL*
up
,
I
should
n't
mind
the
lad
being
brought
up
to
that
.
But
them
*NL*
fine-talking
men
from
the
big
towns
mostly
wear
the
false
*NL*
shirt-fronts
;
they
wear
a
frill

it
's
all
a
mess
,
and
then
hide
it
*NL*
with
a
bib
;
I
know
Riley
does
.
And
then
,
if
Tom
's
to
go
and
live
at
*NL*
Mudport
,
like
Riley
,
he
'll
have
a
house
with
a
kitchen
hardly
big

enough
to
turn
in

sleep
up

can

down

*NL*
``
No

no

said
Mr.
Tulliver
,
``
I

no

continued
Mr.

after
a
pause
,
``
what
*NL*
I
'm
a

on

I

he
's
a

Bessy

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

that
he
does

said
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
accepting
the
last
*NL*
proposition
entirely
on
its
own
merits
;
``
he
's
wonderful
for
liking
a

deal

That
was
my

way
,

my

*NL*
before
him

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
seems
a
bit
a
pity

said
Mr.

,
``

now

Too

continued
Mr.

turning
his
head
dubiously
first
on
one
side

then
on
the
*NL*
other
.
``

no

a

How

together
passes
my
cunning

continued
*NL*
Mrs.

rising
and
going
to
the
window

I
do

*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Tulliver
rapped
the
window
sharply
,
beckoned
,
and
shook
her
*NL*
head
,
--
a
process
which
she
repeated
more
than
once
before
she
returned
*NL*
to
her
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
talk
o

cuteness

Mr.

she
observed
as
she
sat
down
,
*NL*
``

I

in

half-coaxing

this
small

entered

Maggie

curled
crop

had
had
it
cut
too
short

as

was
usually
straight

an
hour
after

taken
out

incessantly
*NL*
tossing
her
head
to
keep
the
dark

heavy
locks
out

gleaming

black

an
action

gave

very

the

any
slighter
ground
than
hunger
and
pins
;
and
*NL*
from
the
cradle
upward
had
been
healthy
,
fair
,
plump
,
and
dull-witted
;
*NL*
in
short
,
the
flower
of
her
family
for
beauty
and
amiability
.
But
milk
*NL*
and
mildness
are
not
the
best
things
for
keeping
,
and
when
they
turn
*NL*
only
a
little
sour
,
they
may
disagree
with
young
stomachs
seriously
.
I
*NL*
have
often
wondered
whether
those
early
Madonnas
of
Raphael
,
with
the
*NL*
blond
faces
and
somewhat
stupid
expression
,
kept
their
placidity
*NL*
undisturbed
when
their
strong-limbed
,
strong-willed
boys
got
a
little
*NL*
too
old
to
do
without
clothing
.
I
think
they
must
have
been
given
to
*NL*
feeble
remonstrance
,
getting
more
and
more
peevish
as
it
became
more
*NL*
and
more
ineffectual
.

Chapter

*NL*
Mr.
Riley
Gives
His
Advice
Concerning
a
School
for
Tom
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
gentleman
in
the
ample
white
cravat
and
shirt-frill
,
taking
his
*NL*
brandy-and-water
so
pleasantly
with
his
good
friend
Tulliver
,
is
Mr.
*NL*
Riley
,
a
gentleman
with
a
waxen
complexion
and
fat
hands
,
rather
*NL*
highly
educated
for
an
auctioneer
and
appraiser
,
but
large-hearted
*NL*
enough
to
show
a
great
deal
of
_
bonhomie
_
toward
simple
country
*NL*
acquaintances
of
hospitable
habits
.
Mr.
Riley
spoke
of
such
*NL*
acquaintances
kindly
as
``
people
of
the
old
school
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
conversation
had
come
to
a
pause
.
Mr.
Tulliver
,
not
without
a
*NL*
particular
reason
,
had
abstained
from
a
seventh
recital
of
the
cool
*NL*
retort
by
which
Riley
had
shown
himself
too
many
for
Dix
,
and
how
*NL*
Wakem
had
had
his
comb
cut
for
once
in
his
life
,
now
the
business
of
*NL*
the
dam
had
been
settled
by
arbitration
,
and
how
there
never
would
*NL*
have
been
any
dispute
at
all
about
the
height
of
water
if
everybody
*NL*
was
what
they
should
be
,
and
Old
Harry
had
n't
made
the
lawyers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Tulliver
was
,
on
the
whole
,
a
man
of
safe
traditional
opinions
;
*NL*
but
on
one
or
two
points
he
had
trusted
to
his
unassisted
intellect
,
*NL*
and
had
arrived
at
several
questionable
conclusions
;
amongst
the
rest
,
*NL*
that
rats
,
weevils
,
and
lawyers
were
created
by
Old
Harry
.
Unhappily
*NL*
he
had
no
one
to
tell
him
that
this
was
rampant
Manichaeism
,
else
he
*NL*
might
have
seen
his
error
.
But
to-day
it
was
clear
that
the
good
*NL*
principle
was
triumphant
:
this
affair
of
the
water-power
had
been
a
*NL*
tangled
business
somehow
,
for
all
it
seemed
--
look
at
it
one
way
--
as
*NL*
plain
as
water
's
water
;
but
,
big
a
puzzle
as
it
was
,
it
had
n't
got
the
*NL*
better
of
Riley
.
Mr.
Tulliver
took
his
brandy-and-water
a
little
*NL*
stronger
than
usual
,
and
,
for
a
man
who
might
be
supposed
to
have
a
*NL*
few
hundreds
lying
idle
at
his
banker
's
,
was
rather
incautiously
open
*NL*
in
expressing
his
high
estimate
of
his
friend
's
business
talents
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
dam
was
a
subject
of
conversation
that
would
keep
;
it
could
*NL*
always
be
taken
up
again
at
the
same
point
,
and
exactly
in
the
same
*NL*
condition
;
and
there
was
another
subject
,
as
you
know
,
on
which
Mr.
*NL*
Tulliver
was
in
pressing
want
of
Mr.
Riley
's
advice
.
This
was
his
*NL*
particular
reason
for
remaining
silent
for
a
short
space
after
his
*NL*
last
draught
,
and
rubbing
his
knees
in
a
meditative
manner
.
He
was
not
*NL*
a
man
to
make
an
abrupt
transition
.
This
was
a
puzzling
world
,
as
he
*NL*
often
said
,
and
if
you
drive
your
wagon
in
a
hurry
,
you
may
light
on
*NL*
an
awkward
corner
.
Mr.
Riley
,
meanwhile
,
was
not
impatient
.
Why
should
*NL*
he
be
?
Even
Hotspur
,
one
would
think
,
must
have
been
patient
in
his
*NL*
slippers
on
a
warm
hearth
,
taking
copious
snuff
,
and
sipping
*NL*
gratuitous
brandy-and-water
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
a
thing
I
've
got
i
'
my
head
,
''
said
Mr.
Tulliver
at
last
,
in
*NL*
rather
a
lower
tone
than
usual
,
as
he
turned
his
head
and
looked
*NL*
steadfastly
at
his
companion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
said
Mr.
Riley
,
in
a
tone
of
mild
interest
.
He
was
a
man
with
*NL*
heavy
waxen
eyelids
and
high-arched
eyebrows
,
looking
exactly
the
same
*NL*
under
all
circumstances
.
This
immovability
of
face
,
and
the
habit
of
*NL*
taking
a
pinch
of
snuff
before
he
gave
an
answer
,
made
him
trebly
*NL*
oracular
to
Mr.
Tulliver
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
very
particular
thing
,
''
he
went
on
;
``
it
's
about
my
boy
Tom
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
sound
of
this
name
,
Maggie
,
who
was
seated
on
a
low
stool
close
*NL*
by
the
fire
,
with
a
large
book
open
on
her
lap
,
shook
her
heavy
hair
*NL*
back
and
looked
up
eagerly
.
There
were
few
sounds
that
roused
Maggie
*NL*
when
she
was
dreaming
over
her
book
,
but
Tom
's
name
served
as
well
as
*NL*
the
shrillest
whistle
;
in
an
instant
she
was
on
the
watch
,
with
*NL*
gleaming
eyes
,
like
a
Skye
terrier
suspecting
mischief
,
or
at
all
*NL*
events
determined
to
fly
at
any
one
who
threatened
it
toward
Tom
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
I
want
to
put
him
to
a
new
school
at
Midsummer
,
''
said
Mr.
*NL*
Tulliver
;
``
he
's
comin
'
away
from
the
`
cademy
at
Lady-day
,
an
'
I
shall
*NL*
let
him
run
loose
for
a
quarter
;
but
after
that
I
want
to
send
him
to
*NL*
a
downright
good
school
,
where
they
'll
make
a
scholard
of
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Mr.
Riley
,
``
there
's
no
greater
advantage
you
can
give
him
*NL*
than
a
good
education
.
Not
,
''
he
added
,
with
polite
significance
,
--
``
not
*NL*
that
a
man
ca
n't
be
an
excellent
miller
and
farmer
,
and
a
shrewd
,
*NL*
sensible
fellow
into
the
bargain
,
without
much
help
from
the
*NL*
schoolmaster
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
you
,
''
said
Mr.
Tulliver
,
winking
,
and
turning
his
head
on
*NL*
one
side
;
``
but
that
's
where
it
is
.
I
do
n't
_
mean
_
Tom
to
be
a
miller
*NL*
and
farmer
.
I
see
no
fun
i
'
that
.
Why
,
if
I
made
him
a
miller
an
'
*NL*
farmer
,
he
'd
be
expectin
'
to
take
to
the
mill
an
'
the
land
,
an
'
*NL*
a-hinting
at
me
as
it
was
time
for
me
to
lay
by
an

think
o
'
my
latter
*NL*
end
.
Nay
,
nay
,
I
've
seen
enough
o
'
that
wi
'
sons
.
I
'll
never
pull
my
*NL*
coat
off
before
I
go
to
bed
.
I
shall
give
Tom
an
eddication
an

put
*NL*
him
to
a
business
,
as
he
may
make
a
nest
for
himself
,

*NL*
push
me
out
o

mine
.
Pretty
well
if
he
gets
it
when
I
'm
dead
an
'
gone
.
*NL*
I
sha
'n'
t
be
put
off
wi
'
spoon-meat
afore
I
've
lost
my
teeth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
evidently
a
point
on
which
Mr.
Tulliver
felt
strongly
;
and
*NL*
the
impetus
which
had
given
unusual
rapidity
and
emphasis
to
his
*NL*
speech
showed
itself
still
unexhausted
for
some
minutes
afterward
in
a
*NL*
defiant
motion
of
the
head
from
side
to
side
,
and
an
occasional
``
Nay
,
*NL*
nay
,
''
like
a
subsiding
growl
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
angry
symptoms
were
keenly
observed
by
Maggie
,
and
cut
her
to
*NL*
the
quick
.
Tom
,
it
appeared
,
was
supposed
capable
of
turning
his
*NL*
father
out
of
doors
,
and
of
making
the
future
in
some
way
tragic
by
*NL*
his
wickedness
.
This
was
not
to
be
borne
;
and
Maggie
jumped
up
from
*NL*
her
stool
,
forgetting
all
about
her
heavy
book
,
which
fell
with
a
bang
*NL*
within
the
fender
,
and
going
up
between
her
father
's
knees
,
said
,
in
a
*NL*
half-crying
,
half-indignant
voice
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Father
,
Tom
would
n't
be
naughty
to
you
ever
;
I
know
he
would
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Tulliver
was
out
of
the
room
superintending
a
choice
supper-dish
,
*NL*
and
Mr.
Tulliver
's
heart
was
touched
;
so
Maggie
was
not
scolded
about
*NL*
the
book
.
Mr.
Riley
quietly
picked
it
up
and
looked
at
it
,
while
the
*NL*
father
laughed
,
with
a
certain
tenderness
in
his
hard-lined
face
,
and
*NL*
patted
his
little
girl
on
the
back
,
and
then
held
her
hands
and
kept
*NL*
her
between
his
knees
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
they
must
n't
say
any
harm
o
'
Tom
,
eh
?
''
said
Mr.
Tulliver
,
*NL*
looking
at
Maggie
with
a
twinkling
eye
.
Then
,
in
a
lower
voice
,
*NL*
turning
to
Mr.
Riley
,
as
though
Maggie
could
n't
hear
,
``
She
understands
*NL*
what
one
's
talking
about
so
as
never
was
.
And
you
should
hear
her
*NL*
read
,
--
straight
off
,
as
if
she
knowed
it
all
beforehand
.
And
allays
at
*NL*
her
book
!
But
it
's
bad
--
it
's
bad
,
''
Mr.
Tulliver
added
sadly
,
checking
*NL*
this
blamable
exultation
.
``
A
woman
's
no
business
wi
'
being
so
clever
;
*NL*
it
'll
turn
to
trouble
,
I
doubt
.
But
bless
you
!
''
--
here
the
exultation
*NL*
was
clearly
recovering
the
mastery
,
--
``
she
'll
read
the
books
and
*NL*
understand
'em
better
nor
half
the
folks
as
are
growed
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
's
cheeks
began
to
flush
with
triumphant
excitement
.
She
thought
*NL*
Mr.
Riley
would
have
a
respect
for
her
now
;
it
had
been
evident
that
*NL*
he
thought
nothing
of
her
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Riley
was
turning
over
the
leaves
of
the
book
,
and
she
could
make
*NL*
nothing
of
his
face
,
with
its
high-arched
eyebrows
;
but
he
presently
*NL*
looked
at
her
,
and
said
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
come
and
tell
me
something
about
this
book
;
here
are
some
*NL*
pictures
,
--
I
want
to
know
what
they
mean
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
,
with
deepening
color
,
went
without
hesitation
to
Mr.
Riley
's
*NL*
elbow
and
looked
over
the
book
,
eagerly
seizing
one
corner
,
and
*NL*
tossing
back
her
mane
,
while
she
said
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
'll
tell
you
what
that
means
.
It
's
a
dreadful
picture
,
is
n't
it
?
*NL*
But
I
ca
n't
help
looking
at
it
.
That
old
woman
in
the
water
's
a
*NL*
witch
,
--
they
've
put
her
in
to
find
out
whether
she
's
a
witch
or
no
;
*NL*
and
if
she
swims
she
's
a
witch
,
and
if
she
's
drowned
--
and
killed
,
you
*NL*
know
--
she
's
innocent
,
and
not
a
witch
,
but
only
a
poor
silly
old
*NL*
woman
.
But
what
good
would
it
do
her
then
,
you
know
,
when
she
was
*NL*
drowned
?
Only
,
I
suppose
,
she
'd
go
to
heaven
,
and
God
would
make
it
up
*NL*
to
her
.
And
this
dreadful
blacksmith
with
his
arms
akimbo
,
*NL*
laughing
,
--
oh
,
is
n't
he
ugly
?
--
I
'll
tell
you
what
he
is
.
He
's
the
*NL*
Devil
_
really
_
''
-LRB-
here
Maggie
's
voice
became
louder
and
more
emphatic
-RRB-
,
*NL*
``
and
not
a
right
blacksmith
;
for
the
Devil
takes
the
shape
of
wicked
*NL*
men
,
and
walks
about
and
sets
people
doing
wicked
things
,
and
he
's
*NL*
oftener
in
the
shape
of
a
bad
man
than
any
other
,
because
,
you
know
,
*NL*
if
people
saw
he
was
the
Devil
,
and
he
roared
at
'em
,
they
'd
run
away
,
*NL*
and
he
could
n't
make
'em
do
what
he
pleased
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Tulliver
had
listened
to
this
exposition
of
Maggie
's
with
*NL*
petrifying
wonder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
what
book
is
it
the
wench
has
got
hold
on
?
''
he
burst
out
at
*NL*
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
`
History
of
the
Devil
,
'
by
Daniel
Defoe
,
--
not
quite
the
right
*NL*
book
for
a
little
girl
,
''
said
Mr.
Riley
.
``
How
came
it
among
your
*NL*
books
,
Mr.
Tulliver
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
looked
hurt
and
discouraged
,
while
her
father
said
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
it
's
one
o

the
books

bought

They

all

bound
alike

it
's
a
good
binding

you
see

I
thought
they
'd
be

all
good
books

There
's
Jeremy

Holy
Living

Dying

among

often

a
Sunday

-LRB-
Mr.
Tulliver
felt
somehow
a
*NL*
familiarity
with
that
great
writer
,
because
his
name
was
Jeremy
-RRB-
;
``

*NL*
there
's
a

more

sermons

all

I
thought

may
say

it

said
Mr.

in

patted
Maggie
on
the
head
,
``
I

put
by

reviving

in

Maggie
ran
in

jumped
on
a

reached
down
from

a

opened
at

Mr.

peremptorily

beginning
to
feel
rather

uncomfortable
at
these
free
remarks
on
the
personal

enough
to

*NL*
Maggie
shut
up
the
book
at
once
,
with
a
sense
of
disgrace
,
but
not
*NL*
being
inclined
to
see
after
her
mother
,
she
compromised
the
matter
by
*NL*
going
into
a
dark
corner
behind
her
father
's
chair
,
and
nursing
her
*NL*
doll
,
toward
which
she
had
an
occasional
fit
of
fondness
in
Tom
's
*NL*
absence
,
neglecting
its
toilet
,
but
lavishing
so
many
warm
kisses
on
*NL*
it
that
the
waxen
cheeks
had
a
wasted

unhealthy
appearance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did

ever

said
Mr.
Tulliver
,
as
Maggie
*NL*
retired
.
``

a
pity

what

lowered

Mr.

's
gravity
gave
way

he
shook
a

under
the

application
of
his
pinch
of
snuff
before
he
said
,

*NL*
``

I
saw
him

*NL*

*NL*
Mr.

took
a
draught
,
swallowed
it
slowly
,
and
shook
his
head
*NL*
in
a
melancholy
manner

conscious
of
exemplifying
the
truth
that
a

at

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
Mr.

,
not
diverted
from
his
purpose
by
any
sympathy

with
Mr.

deficiency
of

*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Riley
took
a
pinch
of
snuff
,
and
kept
Mr.

in
suspense
by
*NL*
a
silence
that
seemed
deliberative
,
before

said
,

*NL*
*NL*

The
fixed
inquiring
glance
with
which
Mr.

had
been
watching

his

oracular
face
became
quite
eager

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay

hear

he
said
,
adjusting
himself
in
his
chair
with
*NL*
the
complacency
of
a
person
who
is
thought
worthy
of
important
*NL*
communications

*NL*
*NL*
``

sententiously

shutting
his

mouth
close

and
looking
at
Mr.

to
observe
the
effect
of
this
*NL*
stimulating
information

*NL*
*NL*
``
What

Mr.

rather
doubtfully

*NL*
``
Yes

the

little
opportunity

has
the
knowledge
that

ground
a

him

There
may

Stelling

Mr.

paused
a
moment
,
while
Mr.
Tulliver
,
some-what
reassured
as
*NL*
to
clerical
tutorship
,
was
inwardly
rehearsing
to
an
imaginary
Mr.

Stelling
the
statement

``
I

*NL*
*NL*
``
You

Mr.

continued
,
``
when

educated
man

like
Stelling

he
's
at

any

When

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay

Mr.

almost
convinced
now
that
the

must
be
the

of

quietly

If

enter

Stelling
at

there
's
no

had
stolen
unperceived
to

elbow
again

listening
with
parted

,
while
she
held

crushed
its

*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
came
round
promptly
in

of
Mr.

,
and
said
,
``
How

*NL*

please

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
a

long

that
gentleman
answered
,
being
of
opinion
*NL*
that
children
,
when
they
are
not
naughty
,
should
always
be
spoken
to
*NL*
jocosely
.
``
You

``

said
Maggie
,
tossing
her
head
haughtily
,
and
*NL*
turning
away
,
with
the
tears
springing
in
her
eyes
.
She
began
to
*NL*
dislike
Mr.
Riley
;
it
was
evident
he
thought
her
silly
and
of
no
*NL*
consequence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hush

Maggie
!
for
shame
of

*NL*
said
her
mother
.
``
Come

down

and
hold

But
,
''
added
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
who
had
her
own
alarm
*NL*
awakened
,
``
is
it
so
far
off
as
I
could
n't
wash
him
and
mend

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
About
fifteen
miles
;
that
's
all
,
''
said
Mr.
Riley
.
``
You
can
drive
*NL*
there
and
back
in
a
day
quite
comfortably

Or

Stelling

pleasant
man

he
'd
be
glad
to
have
you
stay

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
's
too
far
off
for
the

I

said
Mrs.

,
*NL*
sadly
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
entrance
of
supper
opportunely
adjourned
this
difficulty
,
and
*NL*
relieved
Mr.
Riley
from
the
labor
of
suggesting
some
solution
or
*NL*
compromise
,
--
a
labor
which
he
would
otherwise
doubtless
have
*NL*
undertaken
;
for
,
as
you
perceive
,
he
was
a
man
of
very
obliging
*NL*
manners
.
And
he
had
really
given
himself
the
trouble
of
recommending
*NL*
Mr.
Stelling
to
his
friend
Tulliver
without
any
positive
expectation
*NL*
of
a
solid
,
definite
advantage
resulting
to
himself
,
notwithstanding
*NL*
the
subtle
indications
to
the
contrary
which
might
have
misled
a
*NL*
too-sagacious
observer
.
For
there
is
nothing
more
widely
misleading
*NL*
than
sagacity
if
it
happens
to
get
on
a
wrong
scent
;
and
sagacity
,
*NL*
persuaded
that
men
usually
act
and
speak
from
distinct
motives
,
with
a
*NL*
consciously
proposed
end
in
view
,
is
certain
to
waste
its
energies
on
*NL*
imaginary
game
.
*NL*
*NL*
Plotting
covetousness
and
deliberate
contrivance
,
in
order
to
compass
*NL*
a
selfish
end
,
are
nowhere
abundant
but
in
the
world
of
the
dramatist
:
*NL*
they
demand
too
intense
a
mental
action
for
many
of
our
*NL*
fellow-parishioners
to
be
guilty
of
them
.
It
is
easy
enough
to
spoil
*NL*
the
lives
of
our
neighbors
without
taking
so
much
trouble
;
we
can
do
*NL*
it
by
lazy
acquiescence
and
lazy
omission
,
by
trivial
falsities
for
*NL*
which
we
hardly
know
a
reason
,
by
small
frauds
neutralized
by
small
*NL*
extravagances
,
by
maladroit
flatteries
,
and
clumsily
improvised
*NL*
insinuations
.
We
live
from
hand
to
mouth
,
most
of
us
,
with
a
small
*NL*
family
of
immediate
desires
;
we
do
little
else
than
snatch
a
morsel
to
*NL*
satisfy
the
hungry
brood
,
rarely
thinking
of
seed-corn
or
the
next
*NL*
year
's
crop
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Riley
was
a
man
of
business
,
and
not
cold
toward
his
own
interest
,
*NL*
yet
even
he
was
more
under
the
influence
of
small
promptings
than
of
*NL*
far-sighted
designs
.
He
had
no
private
understanding
with
the
Rev.
*NL*
Walter
Stelling
;
on
the
contrary
,
he
knew
very
little
of
that
M.A.
and
*NL*
his
acquirements
,
--
not
quite
enough
,
perhaps
,
to
warrant
so
strong
a
*NL*
recommendation
of
him
as
he
had
given
to
his
friend
Tulliver
.
But
he
*NL*
believed
Mr.
Stelling
to
be
an
excellent
classic
,
for
Gadsby
had
said
*NL*
so
,
and
Gadsby
's
first
cousin
was
an
Oxford
tutor
;
which
was
better
*NL*
ground
for
the
belief
even
than
his
own
immediate
observation
would
*NL*
have
been
,
for
though
Mr.
Riley
had
received
a
tincture
of
the
*NL*
classics
at
the
great
Mudport
Free
School
,
and
had
a
sense
of
*NL*
understanding
Latin
generally
,
his
comprehension
of
any
particular
*NL*
Latin
was
not
ready
.
Doubtless
there
remained
a
subtle
aroma
from
his
*NL*
juvenile
contact
with
the
``
De
Senectute
''
and
the
fourth
book
of
the
*NL*
``
AEneid
,
''
but
it
had
ceased
to
be
distinctly
recognizable
as
classical
,
*NL*
and
was
only
perceived
in
the
higher
finish
and
force
of
his
*NL*
auctioneering
style
.
Then
,
Stelling
was
an
Oxford
man
,
and
the
Oxford
*NL*
men
were
always
--
no
,
no
,
it
was
the
Cambridge
men
who
were
always
good
*NL*
mathematicians
.
But
a
man
who
had
had
a
university
education
could
*NL*
teach
anything
he
liked
;
especially
a
man
like
Stelling
,
who
had
made
*NL*
a
speech
at
a
Mudport
dinner
on
a
political
occasion
,
and
had
*NL*
acquitted
himself
so
well
that
it
was
generally
remarked
,
this
*NL*
son-in-law
of
Timpson
's
was
a
sharp
fellow
.
It
was
to
be
expected
of
a
*NL*
Mudport
man
,
from
the
parish
of
St.
Ursula
,
that
he
would
not
omit
to
*NL*
do
a
good
turn
to
a
son-in-law
of
Timpson
's
,
for
Timpson
was
one
of
*NL*
the
most
useful
and
influential
men
in
the
parish
,
and
had
a
good
deal
*NL*
of
business
,
which
he
knew
how
to
put
into
the
right
hands
.
Mr.
Riley
*NL*
liked
such
men
,
quite
apart
from
any
money
which
might
be
diverted
,
*NL*
through
their
good
judgment
,
from
less
worthy
pockets
into
his
own
;
*NL*
and
it
would
be
a
satisfaction
to
him
to
say
to
Timpson
on
his
return
*NL*
home
,
``
I
've
secured
a
good
pupil
for
your
son-in-law
.
''
Timpson
had
a
*NL*
large
family
of
daughters
;
Mr.
Riley
felt
for
him
;
besides
,
Louisa
*NL*
Timpson
's
face
,
with
its
light
curls
,
had
been
a
familiar
object
to
*NL*
him
over
the
pew
wainscot
on
a
Sunday
for
nearly
fifteen
years
;
it
was
*NL*
natural
her
husband
should
be
a
commendable
tutor
.
Moreover
,
Mr.
Riley
*NL*
knew
of
no
other
schoolmaster
whom
he
had
any
ground
for
recommending
*NL*
in
preference
;
why
,
then
,
should
he
not
recommend
Stelling
?
His
friend
*NL*
Tulliver
had
asked
him
for
an
opinion
;
it
is
always
chilling
,
in
*NL*
friendly
intercourse
,
to
say
you
have
no
opinion
to
give
.
And
if
you
*NL*
deliver
an
opinion
at
all
,
it
is
mere
stupidity
not
to
do
it
with
an
*NL*
air
of
conviction
and
well-founded
knowledge
.
You
make
it
your
own
in
*NL*
uttering
it
,
and
naturally
get
fond
of
it
.
Thus
Mr.
Riley
,
knowing
no
*NL*
harm
of
Stelling
to
begin
with
,
and
wishing
him
well
,
so
far
as
he
had
*NL*
any
wishes
at
all
concerning
him
,
had
no
sooner
recommended
him
than
*NL*
he
began
to
think
with
admiration
of
a
man
recommended
on
such
high
*NL*
authority
,
and
would
soon
have
gathered
so
warm
an
interest
on
the
*NL*
subject
,
that
if
Mr.
Tulliver
had
in
the
end
declined
to
send
Tom
to
*NL*
Stelling
,
Mr.
Riley
would
have
thought
his
``
friend
of
the
old
school
''
*NL*
a
thoroughly
pig-headed
fellow
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
you
blame
Mr.
Riley
very
severely
for
giving
a
recommendation
on
*NL*
such
slight
grounds
,
I
must
say
you
are
rather
hard
upon
him
.
Why
*NL*
should
an
auctioneer
and
appraiser
thirty
years
ago
,
who
had
as
good
*NL*
as
forgotten
his
free-school
Latin
,
be
expected
to
manifest
a
delicate
*NL*
scrupulosity
which
is
not
always
exhibited
by
gentlemen
of
the
learned
*NL*
professions
,
even
in
our
present
advanced
stage
of
morality
?
*NL*
*NL*
Besides
,
a
man
with
the
milk
of
human
kindness
in
him
can
scarcely
*NL*
abstain
from
doing
a
good-natured
action
,
and
one
can
not
be
*NL*
good-natured
all
round
.
Nature
herself
occasionally
quarters
an
*NL*
inconvenient
parasite
on
an
animal
toward
whom
she
has
otherwise
no
*NL*
ill
will
.
What
then
?
We
admire
her
care
for
the
parasite
.
If
Mr.
Riley
*NL*
had
shrunk
from
giving
a
recommendation
that
was
not
based
on
valid
*NL*
evidence
,
he
would
not
have
helped
Mr.
Stelling
to
a
paying
pupil
,
and
*NL*
that
would
not
have
been
so
well
for
the
reverend
gentleman
.
Consider
,
*NL*
too
,
that
all
the
pleasant
little
dim
ideas
and
complacencies
--
of
*NL*
standing
well
with
Timpson
,
of
dispensing
advice
when
he
was
asked
for
*NL*
it
,
of
impressing
his
friend
Tulliver
with
additional
respect
,
of
*NL*
saying
something
,
and
saying
it
emphatically
,
with
other
inappreciably
*NL*
minute
ingredients
that
went
along
with
the
warm
hearth
and
the
*NL*
brandy-and-water
to
make
up
Mr.
Riley
's
consciousness
on
this
*NL*
occasion
--
would
have
been
a
mere
blank
.

*NL*
It
was
a
heavy
disappointment
to
Maggie
that
she
was
not
allowed
to
go
*NL*
with
her
father
in
the
gig
when
he
went
to
fetch
Tom
home
from
the
*NL*
academy
;
but
the
morning
was
too
wet
,
Mrs.
Tulliver
said
,
for
a
little
*NL*
girl
to
go
out
in
her
best
bonnet
.
Maggie
took
the
opposite
view
very
*NL*
strongly
,
and
it
was
a
direct
consequence
of
this
difference
of
*NL*
opinion
that
when
her
mother
was
in
the
act
of
brushing
out
the
*NL*
reluctant
black
crop
Maggie
suddenly
rushed
from
under
her
hands
and
*NL*
dipped
her
head
in
a
basin
of
water
standing
near
,
in
the
vindictive
*NL*
determination
that
there
should
be
no
more
chance
of
curls
that
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Maggie
,

''
exclaimed
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
sitting
stout
and
helpless
*NL*
with
the
brushes
on
her

what
is

*NL*
naughty

I

tell

aunt
Glegg
and
your

Pullet
when

next
week

and
they

never

any

Oh
dear
,
oh
dear
!
look
*NL*
at
your
clean
pinafore
,
wet
from
top
to
bottom
.
Folks
`
ull
think
it
's
*NL*
a
judgment
on
me
as
I
've
got
such
a
child
,

*NL*
Before
this
remonstrance
was
finished
,
Maggie
was
already
out
of
*NL*
hearing
,
making
her
way
toward
the
great
attic
that
run
under
the
old
*NL*
high-pitched
roof
,
shaking
the
water
from
her
black
locks
as
she
ran
,
*NL*
like
a
Skye
terrier
escaped
from
his
bath
.
This
attic
was
Maggie
's
*NL*
favorite
retreat
on
a
wet
day
,
when
the
weather
was
not
too
cold
;
here
*NL*
she
fretted
out
all
her
ill
humors
,
and
talked
aloud
to
the
worm-eaten
*NL*
floors
and
the
worm-eaten
shelves
,
and
the
dark
rafters
festooned
with
*NL*
cobwebs
;
and
here
she
kept
a
Fetish
which
she
punished
for
all
her
*NL*
misfortunes
.
This
was
the
trunk
of
a
large
wooden
doll
,
which
once
*NL*
stared
with
the
roundest
of
eyes
above
the
reddest
of
cheeks
;
but
was
*NL*
now
entirely
defaced
by
a
long
career
of
vicarious
suffering
.
Three
*NL*
nails
driven
into
the
head
commemorated
as
many
crises
in
Maggie
's
*NL*
nine
years
of
earthly
struggle
;
that
luxury
of
vengeance
having
been
*NL*
suggested
to
her
by
the
picture
of
Jael
destroying
Sisera
in
the
old
*NL*
Bible
.
The
last
nail
had
been
driven
in
with
a
fiercer
stroke
than
*NL*
usual
,
for
the
Fetish
on
that
occasion
represented
aunt
Glegg
.
But
*NL*
immediately
afterward
Maggie
had
reflected
that
if
she
drove
many
*NL*
nails
in
she
would
not
be
so
well
able
to
fancy
that
the
head
was
hurt
*NL*
when
she
knocked
it
against
the
wall
,
nor
to
comfort
it
,
and
make
*NL*
believe
to
poultice
it
,
when
her
fury
was
abated
;
for
even
aunt
Glegg
*NL*
would
be
pitiable
when
she
had
been
hurt
very
much
,
and
thoroughly
*NL*
humiliated
,
so
as
to
beg
her
niece
's
pardon
.
Since
then
she
had
driven
*NL*
no
more
nails
in
,
but
had
soothed
herself
by
alternately
grinding
and
*NL*
beating
the
wooden
head
against
the
rough
brick
of
the
great
chimneys
*NL*
that
made
two
square
pillars
supporting
the
roof
.
That
was
what
she
*NL*
did
this
morning
on
reaching
the
attic
,
sobbing
all
the
while
with
a
*NL*
passion
that
expelled
every
other
form
of
consciousness
,
--
even
the
*NL*
memory
of
the
grievance
that
had
caused
it
.
As
at
last
the
sobs
were
*NL*
getting
quieter
,
and
the
grinding
less
fierce
,
a
sudden
beam
of
*NL*
sunshine
,
falling
through
the
wire
lattice
across
the
worm-eaten
*NL*
shelves
,
made
her
throw
away
the
Fetish
and
run
to
the
window
.
The
sun
*NL*
was
really
breaking
out
;
the
sound
of
the
mill
seemed
cheerful
again
;
*NL*
the
granary
doors
were
open
;
and
there
was
Yap
,
the
queer
*NL*
white-and-brown
terrier
,
with
one
ear
turned
back
,
trotting
about
and
*NL*
sniffing
vaguely
,
as
if
he
were
in
search
of
a
companion
.
It
was
*NL*
irresistible
.
Maggie
tossed
her
hair
back
and
ran
downstairs
,
seized
*NL*
her
bonnet
without
putting
it
on
,
peeped
,
and
then
dashed
along
the
*NL*
passage
lest
she
should
encounter
her
mother
,
and
was
quickly
out
in
*NL*
the
yard
,
whirling
round
like
a
Pythoness
,
and
singing
as
she
whirled
,
*NL*
``
Yap
,
Yap
,
Tom
's
coming
home
!
''
while
Yap
danced
and
barked
round
her
,
*NL*
as
much
as
to
say
,
if
there
was
any
noise
wanted
he
was
the
dog
for
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hegh
,
hegh
,
Miss
!
you
'll
make
yourself
giddy
,
an
'
tumble
down
i
'
the
*NL*
dirt
,
''
said
Luke
,
the
head
miller
,
a
tall
,
broad-shouldered
man
of
*NL*
forty
,
black-eyed
and
black-haired
,
subdued
by
a
general
mealiness
,
*NL*
like
an
auricula
.
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
paused
in
her
whirling
and
said
,
staggering
a
little
,
``
Oh
no
,
*NL*
it
does
n't
make
me
giddy
,
Luke
;
may
I
go
into
the
mill
with
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
loved
to
linger
in
the
great
spaces
of
the
mill
,
and
often
came
*NL*
out
with
her
black
hair
powdered
to
a
soft
whiteness
that
made
her
*NL*
dark
eyes
flash
out
with
new
fire
.
The
resolute
din
,
the
unresting
*NL*
motion
of
the
great
stones
,
giving
her
a
dim
,
delicious
awe
as
at
the
*NL*
presence
of
an
uncontrollable
force
;
the
meal
forever
pouring
,
*NL*
pouring
;
the
fine
white
powder
softening
all
surfaces
,
and
making
the
*NL*
very
spidernets
look
like
a
faery
lace-work
;
the
sweet
,
pure
scent
of
*NL*
the
meal
,
--
all
helped
to
make
Maggie
feel
that
the
mill
was
a
little
*NL*
world
apart
from
her
outside
every-day
life
.
The
spiders
were
*NL*
especially
a
subject
of
speculation
with
her
.
She
wondered
if
they
had
*NL*
any
relatives
outside
the
mill
,
for
in
that
case
there
must
be
a
*NL*
painful
difficulty
in
their
family
intercourse
,
--
a
fat
and
floury
*NL*
spider
,
accustomed
to
take
his
fly
well
dusted
with
meal
,
must
suffer
*NL*
a
little
at
a
cousin
's
table
where
the
fly
was
_
au
naturel
_
,
and
the
*NL*
lady
spiders
must
be
mutually
shocked
at
each
other
's
appearance
.
But
*NL*
the
part
of
the
mill
she
liked
best
was
the
topmost
story
,
--
the
*NL*
corn-hutch
,
where
there
were
the
great
heaps
of
grain
,
which
she
could
*NL*
sit
on
and
slide
down
continually
.
She
was
in
the
habit
of
taking
this
*NL*
recreation
as
she
conversed
with
Luke
,
to
whom
she
was
very
*NL*
communicative
,
wishing
him
to
think
well
of
her
understanding
,
as
her
*NL*
father
did
.
*NL*
*NL*
Perhaps
she
felt
it
necessary
to
recover
her
position
with
him
on
the
*NL*
present
occasion
for
,
as
she
sat
sliding
on
the
heap
of
grain
near
*NL*
which
he
was
busying
himself
,
she
said
,
at
that
shrill
pitch
which
was
*NL*
requisite
in
mill-society
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
you
never
read

book

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay

with

rather
foiled
by
Luke

unexpectedly
decided

views
about

``

``
Why

wishing
to
turn

the
conversation
agreeably
;

*NL*
The
invitation
offered
an
agreeable
distraction
to
Maggie
's
grief
,
and
*NL*
her
tears
gradually
subsided
as
she
trotted
along
by
Luke
's
side
to
*NL*
his
pleasant
cottage
,
which
stood
with
its
apple
and
pear
trees
,
and
*NL*
with
the
added
dignity
of
a
lean-to
pigsty
,
at
the
other
end
of
the
*NL*
Mill
fields
.
Mrs.
Moggs
,
Luke
's
wife
,
was
a
decidedly
agreeable
*NL*
acquaintance
.
She
exhibited
her
hospitality
in
bread
and
treacle
,
and
*NL*
possessed
various
works
of
art
.
Maggie
actually
forgot
that
she
had
*NL*
any
special
cause
of
sadness
this
morning
,
as
she
stood
on
a
chair
to
*NL*
look
at
a
remarkable
series
of
pictures
representing
the
Prodigal
Son
*NL*
in
the
costume
of
Sir
Charles
Grandison
,
except
that
,
as
might
have
*NL*
been
expected
from
his
defective
moral
character
,
he
had
not
,
like
*NL*
that
accomplished
hero
,
the
taste
and
strength
of
mind
to
dispense
*NL*
with
a
wig
.
But
the
indefinable
weight
the
dead
rabbits
had
left
on
*NL*
her
mind
caused
her
to
feel
more
than
usual
pity
for
the
career
of
*NL*
this
weak
young
man
,
particularly
when
she
looked
at
the
picture
where
*NL*
he
leaned
against
a
tree
with
a
flaccid
appearance
,
his
knee-breeches
*NL*
unbuttoned
and
his
wig
awry
,
while
the
swine
apparently
of
some
*NL*
foreign
breed
,
seemed
to
insult
him
by
their
good
spirits
over
their
*NL*
feast
of
husks
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
very
glad
his
father
took
him
back
again

are
n't
you

Luke

she
*NL*

said
Luke

''
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
a
painful
thought
to
Maggie
,
and
she
wished
much
that
the
*NL*
subsequent
history
of
the
young
man
had
not
been
left
a
blank
.

Tom
Comes
Home
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
was
to
arrive
early
in
the
afternoon
,
and
there
was
another
*NL*
fluttering
heart
besides
Maggie
's
when
it
was
late
enough
for
the
*NL*
sound
of
the
gig-wheels
to
be
expected
;
for
if
Mrs.
Tulliver
had
a
*NL*
strong
feeling
,
it
was
fondness
for
her
boy
.
At
last
the
sound
*NL*
came
,
--
that
quick
light
bowling
of
the
gig-wheels
,
--
and
in
spite
of
*NL*
the
wind
,
which
was
blowing
the
clouds
about
,
and
was
not
likely
to
*NL*
respect
Mrs.
Tulliver
's
curls
and
cap-strings
,
she
came
outside
the
*NL*
door
,
and
even
held
her
hand
on
Maggie
's
offending
head
,
forgetting
*NL*
all
the
griefs
of
the
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
he
is
,
my
sweet
lad
!
But
,
Lord
ha
'
mercy
!
he
's
got
never
a
*NL*
collar
on
;
it
's
been
lost
on
the
road
,
I
'll
be
bound
,
and
spoilt
the
*NL*
set
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Tulliver
stood
with
her
arms
open
;
Maggie
jumped
first
on
one
leg
*NL*
and
then
on
the
other
;
while
Tom
descended
from
the
gig
,
and
said
,
*NL*
with
masculine
reticence
as
to
the
tender
emotions
,
``
Hallo
!
Yap
--
what
!
*NL*
are
you
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
he
submitted
to
be
kissed
willingly
enough
,
though
Maggie
*NL*
hung
on
his
neck
in
rather
a
strangling
fashion
,
while
his
blue-gray
*NL*
eyes
wandered
toward
the
croft
and
the
lambs
and
the
river
,
where
he
*NL*
promised
himself
that
he
would
begin
to
fish
the
first
thing
to-morrow
*NL*
morning
.
He
was
one
of
those
lads
that
grow
everywhere
in
England
,
and
*NL*
at
twelve
or
thirteen
years
of
age
look
as
much
alike
as
goslings
,
--
a
*NL*
lad
with
light-brown
hair
,
cheeks
of
cream
and
roses
,
full
lips
,
*NL*
indeterminate
nose
and
eyebrows
,
--
a
physiognomy
in
which
it
seems
*NL*
impossible
to
discern
anything
but
the
generic
character
to
boyhood
;
*NL*
as
different
as
possible
from
poor
Maggie
's
phiz
,
which
Nature
seemed
*NL*
to
have
moulded
and
colored
with
the
most
decided
intention
.
But
that
*NL*
same
Nature
has
the
deep
cunning
which
hides
itself
under
the
*NL*
appearance
of
openness
,
so
that
simple
people
think
they
can
see
*NL*
through
her
quite
well
,
and
all
the
while
she
is
secretly
preparing
a
*NL*
refutation
of
their
confident
prophecies
.
Under
these
average
boyish
*NL*
physiognomies
that
she
seems
to
turn
off
by
the
gross
,
she
conceals
*NL*
some
of
her
most
rigid
,
inflexible
purposes
,
some
of
her
most
*NL*
unmodifiable
characters
;
and
the
dark-eyed
,
demonstrative
,
rebellious
*NL*
girl
may
after
all
turn
out
to
be
a
passive
being
compared
with
this
*NL*
pink-and-white
bit
of
masculinity
with
the
indeterminate
features
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Maggie
,
''
said
Tom
,
confidentially
,
taking
her
into
a
corner
,
as
soon
*NL*
as
his
mother
was
gone
out
to
examine
his
box
and
the
warm
parlor
had
*NL*
taken
off
the
chill
he
had
felt
from
the
long
drive
,
``
you
do
n't
know
*NL*
what
I
've
got
in
_
my
_
pockets
,
''
nodding
his
head
up
and
down
as
a
*NL*
means
of
rousing
her
sense
of
mystery
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Maggie
.
``
How
stodgy
they
look
,
Tom
!
Is
it
marls
-LRB-
marbles
-RRB-
*NL*
or
cobnuts
?
''
Maggie
's
heart
sank
a
little
,
because
Tom
always
said
it
*NL*
was
``
no
good
''
playing
with
_
her
_
at
those
games
,
she
played
so
badly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Marls
!
no
;
I
've
swopped
all
my
marls
with
the
little
fellows
,
and
*NL*
cobnuts
are
no
fun
,
you
silly
,
only
when
the
nuts
are
green
.
But
see
*NL*
here
!
''
He
drew
something
half
out
of
his
right-hand
pocket
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
said
Maggie
,
in
a
whisper
.
``
I
can
see
nothing
but
a
bit
*NL*
of
yellow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
it
's
--
a

new

guess

Maggie
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
_
ca
n't

said
Maggie
,
impatiently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
be
a
spitfire
,
else
I
wo
n't
tell
you
,
''
said
Tom
,
thrusting
his
*NL*
hand
back
into
his
pocket
and
looking
determined
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Tom
,
''
said
Maggie
,
imploringly
,
laying
hold
of
the
arm
that
was
*NL*
held
stiffly
in
the
pocket
.
``
I
'm
not
cross
,
Tom
;
it
was
only
because
I
*NL*
ca
n't
bear
guessing

_
Please
_
be
good
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
's
arm
slowly
relaxed
,
and
he
said
,
``
Well
,
then
,
it
's
a
new
*NL*
fish-line
--
two
new
uns
,
--
one
for
you
,
Maggie
,
all
to
yourself
.
I
*NL*
would
n't
go
halves
in
the
toffee
and
gingerbread
on
purpose
to
save
*NL*
the
money
;
and
Gibson
and
Spouncer
fought
with
me
because
I
would
n't
.
*NL*
And
here
's
hooks
;
see
here

I
say
,
_
wo
n't
_
we
go
and
fish
to-morrow
*NL*
down
by
the
Round
Pool
?
And
you
shall
catch
your
own
fish
,
Maggie
and
*NL*
put
the
worms
on
,
and
everything
;
wo
n't
it
be
fun
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
's
answer
was
to
throw
her
arms
round
Tom
's
neck
and
hug
him
,
*NL*
and
hold
her
cheek
against
his
without
speaking
,
while
he
slowly
*NL*
unwound
some
of
the
line
,
saying
,
after
a
pause
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
n't
I
a
good
brother

now
,
to
buy
you
a

all
to

I

it

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

very

very
good

I

do

love
you

Tom

*NL*
*NL*
Tom
had
put
the
line
back
in
his
pocket
,
and
was
looking
at
the
hooks
*NL*
one
by
one
,
before
he
spoke
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
the
fellows
fought
me
,
because
I
would
n't
give
in
about
the
*NL*
toffee

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
dear
!
I
wish
they
would

at
your
school

Did
n't
it
*NL*
hurt
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hurt
me
?
no

''
said
Tom
,
putting
up
the
hooks
again
,
taking
out
a
*NL*
large
pocket-knife
,
and
slowly
opening
the
largest
blade
,
which
he
*NL*
looked
at
meditatively
as
he
rubbed
his
finger
along
it
.
Then
he
*NL*
added
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
gave
Spouncer
a
black
eye

what
he

me

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

*NL*
*NL*
``

``
No

gone
out

not

thinking

just
as
we
go
fishing

then
a
great
lion
might
run

toward

roaring

we

get
away
from
him

What
should
you
*NL*
do

Tom

*NL*
*NL*
Tom
paused
,
and
at
last
turned
away
contemptuously
,
saying
,
``

the
*NL*
lion

the
use

following
him

*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
's
heart
began
to
flutter
with
fear
.
She
dared
not
tell
the
sad
*NL*
truth
at
once
,
but
she
walked
after
Tom
in
trembling
silence
as
he
*NL*
went
out
,
thinking
how
she
could
tell
him
the
news
so
as
to
soften
at
*NL*
once
his
sorrow
and
his
anger
;
for
Maggie
dreaded
Tom
's
anger
of
all
*NL*
things
;
it
was
quite
a
different
anger
from
her
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tom

she
said
,
timidly
,
when
they
were
out
of
doors
,
``
how

did

*NL*
*NL*
``

Tom

promptly

With

ran
away

Maggie
stood
motionless

two
;
*NL*
then
she
turned
round
and
ran
into
the
house
,
and
up
to
her
attic
,
*NL*
where
she
sat
on
the
floor
and
laid
her
head
against
the
worm-eaten
*NL*
shelf
,
with
a
crushing
sense
of
misery
.
Tom
was
come
home
,
and
she
had
*NL*
thought
how
happy
she
should
be
;
and
now
he
was
cruel
to
her
.
What
use
*NL*
was
anything
if
Tom
did
n't
love
her
?
Oh
,
he
was
very
cruel
!
Had
n't
she
*NL*
wanted
to
give
him
the
money
,
and
said
how
very
sorry
she
was
?
She
*NL*
knew
she
was
naughty
to
her
mother
,
but
she
had
never
been
naughty
to
*NL*
Tom
--
had
never
_
meant
_
to
be
naughty
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
he
is
cruel
!
''
Maggie
sobbed
aloud
,
finding
a
wretched
pleasure
in
*NL*
the
hollow
resonance
that
came
through
the
long
empty
space
of
the
*NL*
attic
.
She
never
thought
of
beating
or
grinding
her
Fetish
;
she
was
*NL*
too
miserable
to
be
angry
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
bitter
sorrows
of
childhood
!
when
sorrow
is
all
new
and
strange
,
*NL*
when
hope
has
not
yet
got
wings
to
fly
beyond
the
days
and
weeks
,
and
*NL*
the
space
from
summer
to
summer
seems
measureless
.
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
soon
thought
she
had
been
hours
in
the
attic
,
and
it
must
be
*NL*
tea-time
,
and
they
were
all
having
their
tea
,
and
not
thinking
of
her
.
*NL*
Well
,
then
,
she
would
stay
up
there
and
starve
herself
,
--
hide
herself
*NL*
behind
the
tub
,
and
stay
there
all
night
,
--
and
then
they
would
all
be
*NL*
frightened
,
and
Tom
would
be
sorry
.
Thus
Maggie
thought
in
the
pride
*NL*
of
her
heart
,
as
she
crept
behind
the
tub
;
but
presently
she
began
to
*NL*
cry
again
at
the
idea
that
they
did
n't
mind
her
being
there
.
If
she
*NL*
went
down
again
to
Tom
now
--
would
he
forgive
her
?
Perhaps
her
father
*NL*
would
be
there
,
and
he
would
take
her
part
.
But
then
she
wanted
Tom
to
*NL*
forgive
her
because
he
loved
her
,
not
because
his
father
told
him
.
No
,
*NL*
she
would
never
go
down
if
Tom
did
n't
come
to
fetch
her
.
This
*NL*
resolution
lasted
in
great
intensity
for
five
dark
minutes
behind
the
*NL*
tub
;
but
then
the
need
of
being
loved
--
the
strongest
need
in
poor
*NL*
Maggie
's
nature
--
began
to
wrestle
with
her
pride
,
and
soon
threw
it
.
*NL*
She
crept
from
behind
her
tub
into
the
twilight
of
the
long
attic
,
but
*NL*
just
then
she
heard
a
quick
foot-step
on
the
stairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
had
been
too
much
interested
in
his
talk
with
Luke
,
in
going
the
*NL*
round
of
the
premises
,
walking
in
and
out
where
he
pleased
,
and
*NL*
whittling
sticks
without
any
particular
reason
,
--
except
that
he
did
n't
*NL*
whittle
sticks
at
school
,
--
to
think
of
Maggie
and
the
effect
his
anger
*NL*
had
produced
on
her
.
He
meant
to
punish
her
,
and
that
business
having
*NL*
been
performed
,
he
occupied
himself
with
other
matters
,
like
a
*NL*
practical
person
.
But
when
he
had
been
called
in
to
tea
,
his
father
*NL*
said
,
``
Why
,
where
's
the
little
wench
?
''
and
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
almost
at
*NL*
the
same
moment
,
said
,
``
Where
's
your
little
sister
?
''
--
both
of
them
*NL*
having
supposed
that
Maggie
and
Tom
had
been
together
all
the
*NL*
afternoon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
said
Tom
.
He
did
n't
want
to
``
tell
''
of
Maggie
,
though
*NL*
he
was
angry
with
her
;
for
Tom
Tulliver
was
a
lad
of
honor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
has
n't
she
been
playing
with
you
all
this
while
?
''
said
the
*NL*
father
.
``
She
'd
been
thinking
o
'
nothing
but
your
coming
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
n't
seen
her
this
two
hours
,
''
says
Tom
,
commencing
on
the
*NL*
plumcake
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Goodness
heart
;
she
's
got
drownded
!
''
exclaimed
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
rising
*NL*
from
her
seat
and
running
to
the
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
could
you
let
her
do
so
?
''
she
added
,
as
became
a
fearful
woman
,
*NL*
accusing
she
did
n't
know
whom
of
she
did
n't
know
what
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
nay
,
she
's
none
drownded
,
''
said
Mr.
Tulliver
.
``
You
've
been
*NL*
naughty
to
her
,
I
doubt
,
Tom
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sure
I
have
n't
,
father
,
''
said
Tom
,
indignantly
.
``
I
think
she
's
in
*NL*
the
house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
up
in
that
attic
,
''
said
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
``
a-singing
and
talking
*NL*
to
herself
,
and
forgetting
all
about
meal-times
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
go
and
fetch
her
down
,
Tom
,
''
said
Mr.
Tulliver
,
rather
*NL*
sharply
,
--
his
perspicacity
or
his
fatherly
fondness
for
Maggie
making
*NL*
him
suspect
that
the
lad
had
been
hard
upon
``
the
little
un
,
''
else
she
*NL*
would
never
have
left
his
side
.
``
And
be
good
to
her
,
do
you
hear
?
Else
*NL*
I
'll
let
you
know
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
never
disobeyed
his
father
,
for
Mr.
Tulliver
was
a
peremptory
man
,
*NL*
and
,
as
he
said
,
would
never
let
anybody
get
hold
of
his
whip-hand
;
*NL*
but
he
went
out
rather
sullenly
,
carrying
his
piece
of
plumcake
,
and
*NL*
not
intending
to
reprieve
Maggie
's
punishment
,
which
was
no
more
than
*NL*
she
deserved
.
Tom
was
only
thirteen
,
and
had
no
decided
views
in
*NL*
grammar
and
arithmetic
,
regarding
them
for
the
most
part
as
open
*NL*
questions
,
but
he
was
particularly
clear
and
positive
on
one
*NL*
point
,
--
namely
,
that
he
would
punish
everybody
who
deserved
it
.
Why
,
*NL*
he
would
n't
have
minded
being
punished
himself
if
he
deserved
it
;
but
,
*NL*
then
,
he
never
_
did
_
deserve
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
Tom
's
step
,
then
,
that
Maggie
heard
on
the
stairs
,
when
her
*NL*
need
of
love
had
triumphed
over
her
pride
,
and
she
was
going
down
with
*NL*
her
swollen
eyes
and
dishevelled
hair
to
beg
for
pity
.
At
least
her
*NL*
father
would
stroke
her
head
and
say
,
``
Never
mind
,
my
wench
.
''
It
is
a
*NL*
wonderful
subduer
,
this
need
of
love
,
--
this
hunger
of
the
heart
,
--
as
*NL*
peremptory
as
that
other
hunger
by
which
Nature
forces
us
to
submit
to
*NL*
the
yoke
,
and
change
the
face
of
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
knew
Tom
's
step
,
and
her
heart
began
to
beat
violently
with
*NL*
the
sudden
shock
of
hope
.
He
only
stood
still
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
*NL*
and
said
,
``
Maggie
,
you
're
to
come
down
.
''
But
she
rushed
to
him
and
*NL*
clung
round
his
neck
,
sobbing
,
``
Oh
,
Tom
,
please
forgive
me
--
I
ca
n't
*NL*
bear
it
--
I
will
always
be
good
--
always
remember
things
--
do
love
*NL*
me
--
please
,
dear
Tom
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
learn
to
restrain
ourselves
as
we
get
older
.
We
keep
apart
when
we
*NL*
have
quarrelled
,
express
ourselves
in
well-bred
phrases
,
and
in
this
*NL*
way
preserve
a
dignified
alienation
,
showing
much
firmness
on
one
*NL*
side
,
and
swallowing
much
grief
on
the
other
.
We
no
longer
approximate
*NL*
in
our
behavior
to
the
mere
impulsiveness
of
the
lower
animals
,
but
*NL*
conduct
ourselves
in
every
respect
like
members
of
a
highly
civilized
*NL*
society
.
Maggie
and
Tom
were
still
very
much
like
young
animals
,
and
*NL*
so
she
could
rub
her
cheek
against
his
,
and
kiss
his
ear
in
a
random
*NL*
sobbing
way
;
and
there
were
tender
fibres
in
the
lad
that
had
been
*NL*
used
to
answer
to
Maggie
's
fondling
,
so
that
he
behaved
with
a
*NL*
weakness
quite
inconsistent
with
his
resolution
to
punish
her
as
much
*NL*
as
she
deserved
.
He
actually
began
to
kiss
her
in
return
,
and
say
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
cry
,
then
,
Magsie
;
here
,
eat
a
bit
o
'
cake
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
's
sobs
began
to
subside
,
and
she
put
out
her
mouth
for
the
cake
*NL*
and
bit
a
piece
;
and
then
Tom
bit
a
piece
,
just
for
company
,
and
they
*NL*
ate
together
and
rubbed
each
other
's
cheeks
and
brows
and
noses
*NL*
together
,
while
they
ate
,
with
a
humiliating
resemblance
to
two
*NL*
friendly
ponies
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
along
,
Magsie
,
and
have
tea
,
''
said
Tom
at
last
,
when
there
was
*NL*
no
more
cake
except
what
was
down-stairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
ended
the
sorrows
of
this
day
,
and
the
next
morning
Maggie
was
*NL*
trotting
with
her
own
fishing-rod
in
one
hand
and
a
handle
of
the
*NL*
basket
in
the
other
,
stepping
always
,
by
a
peculiar
gift
,
in
the
*NL*
muddiest
places
,
and
looking
darkly
radiant
from
under
her
*NL*
beaver-bonnet
because
Tom
was
good
to
her
.
She
had
told
Tom
,
however
,
*NL*
that
she
should
like
him
to
put
the
worms
on
the
hook
for
her
,
*NL*
although
she
accepted
his
word
when
he
assured
her
that
worms
could
n't
*NL*
feel
-LRB-
it
was
Tom
's
private
opinion
that
it
did
n't
much
matter
if
they
*NL*
did
-RRB-
.
He
knew
all
about
worms
,
and
fish
,
and
those
things
;
and
what
*NL*
birds
were
mischievous
,
and
how
padlocks
opened
,
and
which
way
the
*NL*
handles
of
the
gates
were
to
be
lifted
.
Maggie
thought
this
sort
of
*NL*
knowledge
was
very
wonderful
,
--
much
more
difficult
than
remembering
*NL*
what
was
in
the
books
;
and
she
was
rather
in
awe
of
Tom
's
superiority
,
*NL*
for
he
was
the
only
person
who
called
her
knowledge
``
stuff
,
''
and
did
*NL*
not
feel
surprised
at
her
cleverness
.
Tom
,
indeed
,
was
of
opinion
that
*NL*
Maggie
was
a
silly
little
thing
;
all
girls
were
silly
,
--
they
could
n't
*NL*
throw
a
stone
so
as
to
hit
anything
,
could
n't
do
anything
with
a
*NL*
pocket-knife
,
and
were
frightened
at
frogs
.
Still
,
he
was
very
fond
of
*NL*
his
sister
,
and
meant
always
to
take
care
of
her
,
make
her
his
*NL*
housekeeper
,
and
punish
her
when
she
did
wrong
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
on
their
way
to
the
Round
Pool
,
--
that
wonderful
pool
,
which
*NL*
the
floods
had
made
a
long
while
ago
.
No
one
knew
how
deep
it
was
;
and
*NL*
it
was
mysterious
,
too
,
that
it
should
be
almost
a
perfect
round
,
*NL*
framed
in
with
willows
and
tall
reeds
,
so
that
the
water
was
only
to
*NL*
be
seen
when
you
got
close
to
the
brink
.
The
sight
of
the
old
favorite
*NL*
spot
always
heightened
Tom
's
good
humor
,
and
he
spoke
to
Maggie
in
the
*NL*
most
amicable
whispers
,
as
he
opened
the
precious
basket
and
prepared
*NL*
their
tackle
.
He
threw
her
line
for
her
,
and
put
the
rod
into
her
*NL*
hand
.
Maggie
thought
it
probable
that
the
small
fish
would
come
to
her
*NL*
hook
,
and
the
large
ones
to
Tom
's
.
But
she
had
forgotten
all
about
the
*NL*
fish
,
and
was
looking
dreamily
at
the
glassy
water
,
when
Tom
said
,
in
*NL*
a
loud
whisper
,
``
Look
,
look
,
Maggie
!
''
and
came
running
to
prevent
her
*NL*
from
snatching
her
line
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
was
frightened
lest
she
had
been
doing
something
wrong
,
as
*NL*
usual
,
but
presently
Tom
drew
out
her
line
and
brought
a
large
tench
*NL*
bouncing
on
the
grass
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
was
excited
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
Magsie
,
you
little
duck
!
Empty
the
basket
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
was
not
conscious
of
unusual
merit
,
but
it
was
enough
that
Tom
*NL*
called
her
Magsie
,
and
was
pleased
with
her
.
There
was
nothing
to
mar
*NL*
her
delight
in
the
whispers
and
the
dreamy
silences
,
when
she
listened
*NL*
to
the
light
dripping
sounds
of
the
rising
fish
,
and
the
gentle
*NL*
rustling
,
as
if
the
willows
and
the
reeds
and
the
water
had
their
*NL*
happy
whisperings
also
.
Maggie
thought
it
would
make
a
very
nice
*NL*
heaven
to
sit
by
the
pool
in
that
way
,
and
never
be
scolded
.
She
never
*NL*
knew
she
had
a
bite
till
Tom
told
her
;
but
she
liked
fishing
very
*NL*
much
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
one
of
their
happy
mornings
.
They
trotted
along
and
sat
down
*NL*
together
,
with
no
thought
that
life
would
ever
change
much
for
them
;
*NL*
they
would
only
get
bigger
and
not
go
to
school
,
and
it
would
always
*NL*
be
like
the
holidays
;
they
would
always
live
together
and
be
fond
of
*NL*
each
other
.
And
the
mill
with
its
booming
;
the
great
chestnut-tree
*NL*
under
which
they
played
at
houses
;
their
own
little
river
,
the
Ripple
,
*NL*
where
the
banks
seemed
like
home
,
and
Tom
was
always
seeing
the
*NL*
water-rats
,
while
Maggie
gathered
the
purple
plumy
tops
of
the
reeds
,
*NL*
which
she
forgot
and
dropped
afterward
;
above
all
,
the
great
Floss
,
*NL*
along
which
they
wandered
with
a
sense
of
travel
,
to
see
the
rushing
*NL*
spring-tide
,
the
awful
Eagle
,
come
up
like
a
hungry
monster
,
or
to
see
*NL*
the
Great
Ash
which
had
once
wailed
and
groaned
like
a
man
,
these
*NL*
things
would
always
be
just
the
same
to
them
.
Tom
thought
people
were
*NL*
at
a
disadvantage
who
lived
on
any
other
spot
of
the
globe
;
and
*NL*
Maggie
,
when
she

always

*NL*
*NL*
Life
did
change
for
Tom
and
Maggie
;
and
yet
they
were
not
wrong
in
*NL*
believing
that
the
thoughts
and
loves
of
these
first
years
would
*NL*
always
make
part
of
their
lives
.
We
could
never
have
loved
the
earth
*NL*
so
well
if
we
had
had
no
childhood
in
it
,
--
if
it
were
not
the
earth
*NL*
where
the
same
flowers
come
up
again
every
spring
that
we
used
to
*NL*
gather
with
our
tiny
fingers
as
we
sat
lisping
to
ourselves
on
the
*NL*
grass
;
the
same
hips
and
haws
on
the
autumn
's
hedgerows
;
the
same
*NL*
redbreasts
that
we
used
to
call
``
God
's
birds
,
''
because
they
did
no
*NL*
harm
to
the
precious
crops
.
What
novelty
is
worth
that
sweet
monotony
*NL*
where
everything
is
known
,
and
_
loved
_
because
it
is
known

walk

the
young
yellow-brown

foliage
of

between

and

sky
,
the
white
*NL*
star-flowers
and
the
blue-eyed
speedwell
and
the
ground
ivy
at

feet

what
grove
of
tropic
palms
,
what
strange
ferns
or
splendid
*NL*
broad-petalled
blossoms
,
could
ever
thrill
such
deep
and
delicate
*NL*
fibres
within
me
as
this

scene

These
familiar
flowers
,
these
*NL*
well-remembered
bird-notes
,
this
sky
,
with
its
fitful
brightness
,
*NL*
these
furrowed
and
grassy
fields
,
each
with
a
sort
of
personality
*NL*
given
to
it
by
the
capricious
hedgerows
,
--
such
things
as
these
are
the
*NL*
mother-tongue
of
our
imagination
,
the
language
that
is
laden
with
all
*NL*
the
subtle
,
inextricable
associations
the
fleeting
hours
of
our
*NL*
childhood
left
behind
them
.
Our
delight
in
the
sunshine
on
the
*NL*
deep-bladed
grass
to-day
might
be
no
more
than
the
faint
perception
of
*NL*
wearied
souls
,
if
it
were
not
for
the
sunshine
and
the
grass
in
the

far-off
years

still
live
in

our
perception

It
was
Easter
week
,
and
Mrs.
Tulliver
's
cheesecakes
were
more
*NL*
exquisitely
light
than
usual
.
``
A

Kezia
the
housemaid
said
,
feeling
proud
to
live
under
*NL*
a
mistress
who
could
make
such
pastry
;
so
that
no
season
or
*NL*
circumstances
could
have
been
more
propitious
for
a
family
party
,
even
*NL*
if
it
had
not
been
advisable
to
consult
sister
Glegg
and
sister
Pullet
*NL*
about
Tom
's
going
to
school
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'd
as
lief
not
invite
sister
Deane
this
time
,
''
said
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
*NL*
``
for
she
's
as
jealous

can
be

my
poor
children

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

Mr.

,
``

six

*NL*
*NL*
``
That

neither
aunt

so
much

a
leggicy

And
there
's
sister
Glegg

Pullet

saving

'em
everything

''
*NL*
Mrs.
Tulliver
was
a
mild
woman
,
but
even
a
sheep
will
face
about
a
*NL*
little
when
she
has
lambs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tchuh

said
Mr.
Tulliver
.
``
It

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do

Mrs.

,
``

Maggie

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

Mr.
Tulliver

why

be

I
must
put

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,

,
do
as
you

,
Bessy
,
''
said
Mr.
Tulliver
,
taking
up
his
*NL*
hat
and
walking
out
to
the
mill
.
Few
wives
were
more
submissive
than
*NL*
Mrs.
Tulliver
on
all
points
unconnected
with
her
family
relations
;
but
*NL*
she
had
been
a
Miss
Dodson
,
and
the
Dodsons
were
a
very
respectable
*NL*
family
indeed
,
--
as
much
looked
up
to
as
any
in
their
own
parish
,
or
*NL*
the
next
to
it
.
The
Miss
Dodsons
had
always
been
thought
to
hold
up
*NL*
their
heads
very
high
,
and
no
one
was
surprised
the
two
eldest
had
*NL*
married
so
well
,
--
not
at
an
early
age
,
for
that
was
not
the
practice
*NL*
of
the
Dodson
family
.
There
were
particular
ways
of
doing
everything
*NL*
in
that
family
:
particular
ways
of
bleaching
the
linen
,
of
making
the
*NL*
cowslip
wine
,
curing
the
hams
,
and
keeping
the
bottled
gooseberries
;
*NL*
so
that
no
daughter
of
that
house
could
be
indifferent
to
the
*NL*
privilege
of
having
been
born
a
Dodson
,
rather
than
a
Gibson
or
a
*NL*
Watson
.
Funerals
were
always
conducted
with
peculiar
propriety
in
the
*NL*
Dodson
family
:
the
hat-bands
were
never
of
a
blue
shade
,
the
gloves
*NL*
never
split
at
the
thumb
,
everybody
was
a
mourner
who
ought
to
be
,
and
*NL*
there
were
always
scarfs
for
the
bearers
.
When
one
of
the
family
was
*NL*
in
trouble
or
sickness
,
all
the
rest
went
to
visit
the
unfortunate
*NL*
member
,
usually
at
the
same
time
,
and
did
not
shrink
from
uttering
the
*NL*
most
disagreeable
truths
that
correct
family
feeling
dictated
;
if
the
*NL*
illness
or
trouble
was
the
sufferer
's
own
fault
,
it
was
not
in
the
*NL*
practice
of
the
Dodson
family
to
shrink
from
saying
so
.
In
short
,
*NL*
there
was
in
this
family
a
peculiar
tradition
as
to
what
was
the
right
*NL*
thing
in
household
management
and
social
demeanor
,
and
the
only
bitter
*NL*
circumstance
attending
this
superiority
was
a
painful
inability
to
*NL*
approve
the
condiments
or
the
conduct
of
families
ungoverned
by
the
*NL*
Dodson
tradition
.
A
female
Dodson
,
when
in
``
strange
houses
,
''
always
*NL*
ate
dry
bread
with
her
tea
,
and
declined
any
sort
of
preserves
,
having
*NL*
no
confidence
in
the
butter
,
and
thinking
that
the
preserves
had
*NL*
probably
begun
to
ferment
from
want
of
due
sugar
and
boiling
.
There
*NL*
were
some
Dodsons
less
like
the
family
than
others
,
that
was
admitted
;
*NL*
but
in
so
far
as
they
were
``
kin
,
''
they
were
of
necessity
better
than
*NL*
those
who
were
``
no
kin
.
''
And
it
is
remarkable
that
while
no
individual
*NL*
Dodson
was
satisfied
with
any
other
individual
Dodson
,
each
was
*NL*
satisfied
,
not
only
with
him
or
her
self
,
but
with
the
Dodsons
*NL*
collectively
.
The
feeblest
member
of
a
family
--
the
one
who
has
the
*NL*
least
character
--
is
often
the
merest
epitome
of
the
family
habits
and
*NL*
traditions
;
and
Mrs.
Tulliver
was
a
thorough
Dodson
,
though
a
mild
*NL*
one
,
as
small-beer
,
so
long
as
it
is
anything
,
is
only
describable
as
*NL*
very
weak
ale
:
and
though
she
had
groaned
a
little
in
her
youth
under
*NL*
the
yoke
of
her
elder
sisters
,
and
still
shed
occasional
tears
at
*NL*
their
sisterly
reproaches
,
it
was
not
in
Mrs.
Tulliver
to
be
an
*NL*
innovator
on
the
family
ideas
.
She
was
thankful
to
have
been
a
Dodson
,
*NL*
and
to
have
one
child
who
took
after
her
own
family
,
at
least
in
his
*NL*
features
and
complexion
,
in
liking
salt
and
in
eating
beans
,
which
a
*NL*
Tulliver
never
did
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
other
respects
the
true
Dodson
was
partly
latent
in
Tom
,
and
he
was
*NL*
as
far
from
appreciating
his
``
kin
''
on
the
mother
's
side
as
Maggie
*NL*
herself
,
generally
absconding
for
the
day
with
a
large
supply
of
the
*NL*
most
portable
food
,
when
he
received
timely
warning
that
his
aunts
and
*NL*
uncles
were
coming
,
--
a
moral
symptom
from
which
his
aunt
Glegg
deduced
*NL*
the
gloomiest
views
of
his
future
.
It
was
rather
hard
on
Maggie
that
*NL*
Tom
always
absconded
without
letting
her
into
the
secret
,
but
the
*NL*
weaker
sex
are
acknowledged
to
be
serious
_
impedimenta
_
in
cases
of
*NL*
flight
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
Wednesday
,
the
day
before
the
aunts
and
uncles
were
coming
,
there
*NL*
were
such
various
and
suggestive
scents
,
as
of
plumcakes
in
the
oven
*NL*
and
jellies
in
the
hot
state
,
mingled
with
the
aroma
of
gravy
,
that
it
*NL*
was
impossible
to
feel
altogether
gloomy
:
there
was
hope
in
the
air
.
*NL*
Tom
and
Maggie
made
several
inroads
into
the
kitchen
,
and
,
like
other
*NL*
marauders
,
were
induced
to
keep
aloof
for
a
time
only
by
being
allowed
*NL*
to
carry
away
a
sufficient
load
of
booty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tom
,
''
said
Maggie
,
as
they
sat
on
the
boughs
of
the
elder-tree
,
*NL*
eating
their
jam-puffs
,
``
shall
you
run
away
to-morrow
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Tom
,
slowly
,
when
he
had
finished
his
puff
,
and
was
eying
*NL*
the
third
,
which
was
to
be
divided
between
them
,
--
``
no
,
I
sha
'n'
t.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
Tom
?
Because
Lucy
's
coming
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Tom
,
opening
his
pocket-knife
and
holding
it
over
the
puff
,
*NL*
with
his
head
on
one
side
in
a
dubitative
manner
.
-LRB-
It
was
a
difficult
*NL*
problem
to
divide
that
very
irregular
polygon
into
two
equal
parts
.
-RRB-
*NL*
``
What
do
_
I
_
care
about
Lucy
?
She
's
only
a
girl
,
--
_
she
_
ca
n't
play
at
*NL*
bandy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
the
tipsy-cake
,
then
?
''
said
Maggie
,
exerting
her
hypothetic
*NL*
powers
,
while
she
leaned
forward
toward
Tom
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
*NL*
hovering
knife
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
you
silly
,
that
'll
be
good
the
day
after
.
It
's
the
pudden
.
I
know
*NL*
what
the
pudden
's
to
be
,
--
apricot
roll-up
--
O
my
buttons
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
this
interjection
,
the
knife
descended
on
the
puff
,
and
it
was
in
*NL*
two
,
but
the
result
was
not
satisfactory
to
Tom
,
for
he
still
eyed
the
*NL*
halves
doubtfully
.
At
last
he
said
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shut
your
eyes
,
Maggie
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
never
mind
what
for
.
Shut
'em
when
I
tell
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
obeyed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
which
'll
you
have
,
Maggie
,
--
right
hand
or
left
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
have
that
with
the
jam
run
out
,
''
said
Maggie
,
keeping
her
eyes
*NL*
shut
to
please
Tom
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
you
do
n't
like
that
,
you
silly
.
You
may
have
it
if
it
comes
to
*NL*
you
fair
,
but
I
sha
'n'
t
give
it
you
without
.
Right
or
left
,
--
you
*NL*
choose
,
now
.
Ha-a-a
!
''
said
Tom
,
in
a
tone
of
exasperation
,
as
Maggie
*NL*
peeped
.
``
You
keep
your
eyes
shut
,
now
,
else
you
sha
'n'
t
have
any
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
's
power
of
sacrifice
did
not
extend
so
far
;
indeed
,
I
fear
she
*NL*
cared
less
that
Tom
should
enjoy
the
utmost
possible
amount
of
puff
,
*NL*
than
that
he
should
be
pleased
with
her
for
giving
him
the
best
bit
.
*NL*
So
she
shut
her
eyes
quite
close
,
till
Tom
told
her
to
``
say
which
,
''
*NL*
and
then
she
said
,
``
Left
hand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
got
it
,
''
said
Tom
,
in
rather
a
bitter
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
the
bit
with
the
jam
run
out
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
here
,
take
it
,
''
said
Tom
,
firmly
,
handing
,
decidedly
the
best
*NL*
piece
to
Maggie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
please
,
Tom
,
have
it
;
I
do
n't
mind
--
I
like
the
other
;
please
take
*NL*
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
sha
'n'
t
,
''
said
Tom
,
almost
crossly
,
beginning
on
his
own
*NL*
inferior
piece
.
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
,
thinking
it
was
no
use
to
contend
further
,
began
too
,
and
ate
*NL*
up
her
half
puff
with
considerable
relish
as
well
as
rapidity
.
But
Tom
*NL*
had
finished
first
,
and
had
to
look
on
while
Maggie
ate
her
last
*NL*
morsel
or
two
,
feeling
in
himself
a
capacity
for
more
.
Maggie
did
n't
*NL*
know
Tom
was
looking
at
her
;
she
was
seesawing
on
the
elder-bough
,
*NL*
lost
to
almost
everything
but
a
vague
sense
of
jam
and
idleness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
greedy
thing
!
''
said
Tom
,
when
she
had
swallowed
the
last
*NL*
morsel
.
He
was
conscious
of
having
acted
very
fairly
,
and
thought
she
*NL*
ought
to
have
considered
this
,
and
made
up
to
him
for
it
.
He
would
*NL*
have
refused
a
bit
of
hers
beforehand
,
but
one
is
naturally
at
a
*NL*
different
point
of
view
before
and
after
one
's
own
share
of
puff
is
*NL*
swallowed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
turned
quite
pale
.
``
Oh
,
Tom
,
why
did
n't
you
ask
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
n't
going
to
ask
you
for
a
bit
,
you
greedy
.
You
might
have
*NL*
thought
of
it
without
,
when
you
knew
I
gave
you
the
best
bit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
wanted
you
to
have
it
;
you
know
I
did
,
''
said
Maggie
,
in
an
*NL*
injured
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
I
was
n't
going
to
do
what
was
n't
fair
,
like
Spouncer
.
He
*NL*
always
takes
the
best
bit
,
if
you
do
n't
punch
him
for
it
;
and
if
you
*NL*
choose
the
best
with
your
eyes
shut
,
he
changes
his
hands
.
But
if
I
go
*NL*
halves
,
I
'll
go
'em
fair
;
only
I
would
n't
be
a
greedy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
this
cutting
innuendo
,
Tom
jumped
down
from
his
bough
,
and
threw
*NL*
a
stone
with
a
``
hoigh
!
''
as
a
friendly
attention
to
Yap
,
who
had
also
*NL*
been
looking
on
while
the
eatables
vanished
,
with
an
agitation
of
his
*NL*
ears
and
feelings
which
could
hardly
have
been
without
bitterness
.
Yet
*NL*
the
excellent
dog
accepted
Tom
's
attention
with
as
much
alacrity
as
if
*NL*
he
had
been
treated
quite
generously
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Maggie
,
gifted
with
that
superior
power
of
misery
which
*NL*
distinguishes
the
human
being
,
and
places
him
at
a
proud
distance
from
*NL*
the
most
melancholy
chimpanzee
,
sat
still
on
her
bough
,
and
gave
*NL*
herself
up
to
the
keen
sense
of
unmerited
reproach
.
She
would
have
*NL*
given
the
world
not
to
have
eaten
all
her
puff
,
and
to
have
saved
some
*NL*
of
it
for
Tom
.
Not
but
that
the
puff
was
very
nice
,
for
Maggie
's
*NL*
palate
was
not
at
all
obtuse
,
but
she
would
have
gone
without
it
many
*NL*
times
over
,
sooner
than
Tom
should
call
her
greedy
and
be
cross
with
*NL*
her
.
And
he
had
said
he
would
n't
have
it
,
and
she
ate
it
without
*NL*
thinking
;
how
could
she
help
it
?
The
tears
flowed
so
plentifully
that
*NL*
Maggie
saw
nothing
around
her
for
the
next
ten
minutes
;
but
by
that
*NL*
time
resentment
began
to
give
way
to
the
desire
of
reconciliation
,
and
*NL*
she
jumped
from
her
bough
to
look
for
Tom
.
He
was
no
longer
in
the
*NL*
paddock
behind
the
rickyard
;
where
was
he
likely
to
be
gone
,
and
Yap
*NL*
with
him
?
Maggie
ran
to
the
high
bank
against
the
great
holly-tree
,
*NL*
where
she
could
see
far
away
toward
the
Floss
.
There
was
Tom
;
but
her
*NL*
heart
sank
again
as
she
saw
how
far
off
he
was
on
his
way
to
the
great
*NL*
river
,
and
that
he
had
another
companion
besides
Yap
,
--
naughty
Bob
*NL*
Jakin
,
whose
official
,
if
not
natural
,
function
of
frightening
the
*NL*
birds
was
just
now
at
a
standstill
.
Maggie
felt
sure
that
Bob
was
*NL*
wicked
,
without
very
distinctly
knowing
why
;
unless
it
was
because
*NL*
Bob
's
mother
was
a
dreadfully
large
fat
woman
,
who
lived
at
a
queer
*NL*
round
house
down
the
river
;
and
once
,
when
Maggie
and
Tom
had
wandered
*NL*
thither
,
there
rushed
out
a
brindled
dog
that
would
n't
stop
barking
;
*NL*
and
when
Bob
's
mother
came
out
after
it
,
and
screamed
above
the
*NL*
barking
to
tell
them
not
to
be
frightened
,
Maggie
thought
she
was
*NL*
scolding
them
fiercely
,
and
her
heart
beat
with
terror
.
Maggie
thought
*NL*
it
very
likely
that
the
round
house
had
snakes
on
the
floor
,
and
bats
*NL*
in
the
bedroom
;
for
she
had
seen
Bob
take
off
his
cap
to
show
Tom
a
*NL*
little
snake
that
was
inside
it
,
and
another
time
he
had
a
handful
of
*NL*
young
bats
:
altogether
,
he
was
an
irregular
character
,
perhaps
even
*NL*
slightly
diabolical
,
judging
from
his
intimacy
with
snakes
and
bats
;
*NL*
and
to
crown
all
,
when
Tom
had
Bob
for
a
companion
,
he
did
n't
mind
*NL*
about
Maggie
,
and
would
never
let
her
go
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
must
be
owned
that
Tom
was
fond
of
Bob
's
company
.
How
could
it
be
*NL*
otherwise
?
Bob
knew
,
directly
he
saw
a
bird
's
egg
,
whether
it
was
a
*NL*
swallow
's
,
or
a
tomtit
's
,
or
a
yellow-hammer
's
;
he
found
out
all
the
*NL*
wasps
'
nests
,
and
could
set
all
sort
of
traps
;
he
could
climb
the
*NL*
trees
like
a
squirrel
,
and
had
quite
a
magical
power
of
detecting
*NL*
hedgehogs
and
stoats
;
and
he
had
courage
to
do
things
that
were
rather
*NL*
naughty
,
such
as
making
gaps
in
the
hedgerows
,
throwing
stones
after
*NL*
the
sheep
,
and
killing
a
cat
that
was
wandering
_
incognito
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
qualities
in
an
inferior
,
who
could
always
be
treated
with
*NL*
authority
in
spite
of
his
superior
knowingness
,
had
necessarily
a
*NL*
fatal
fascination
for
Tom
;
and
every
holiday-time
Maggie
was
sure
to
*NL*
have
days
of
grief
because
he
had
gone
off
with
Bob
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
!
there
was
no
hope
for
it
;
he
was
gone
now
,
and
Maggie
could
*NL*
think
of
no
comfort
but
to
sit
down
by
the
hollow
,
or
wander
by
the
*NL*
hedgerow
,
and
fancy
it
was
all
different
,
refashioning
her
little
*NL*
world
into
just
what
she
should
like
it
to
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
's
was
a
troublous
life
,
and
this
was
the
form
in
which
she
took
*NL*
her
opium
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
Tom
,
forgetting
all
about
Maggie
and
the
sting
of
reproach
*NL*
which
he
had
left
in
her
heart
,
was
hurrying
along
with
Bob
,
whom
he
*NL*
had
met
accidentally
,
to
the
scene
of
a
great
rat-catching
in
a
*NL*
neighboring
barn
.
Bob
knew
all
about
this
particular
affair
,
and
spoke
*NL*
of
the
sport
with
an
enthusiasm
which
no
one
who
is
not
either
*NL*
divested
of
all
manly
feeling
,
or
pitiably
ignorant
of
rat-catching
,
*NL*
can
fail
to
imagine
.
For
a
person
suspected
of
preternatural
*NL*
wickedness
,
Bob
was
really
not
so
very
villanous-looking
;
there
was
*NL*
even
something
agreeable
in
his
snub-nosed
face
,
with
its
close-curled
*NL*
border
of
red
hair
.
But
then
his
trousers
were
always
rolled
up
at
the
*NL*
knee
,
for
the
convenience
of
wading
on
the
slightest
notice
;
and
his
*NL*
virtue
,
supposing
it
to
exist
,
was
undeniably
``
virtue
in
rags
,
''
which
,
*NL*
on
the
authority
even
of
bilious
philosophers
,
who
think
all
*NL*
well-dressed
merit
overpaid
,
is
notoriously
likely
to
remain
*NL*
unrecognized
-LRB-
perhaps
because
it
is
seen
so
seldom
-RRB-
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
the
chap
as
owns
the
ferrets
,
''
said
Bob
,
in
a
hoarse
treble
*NL*
voice
,
as
he
shuffled
along
,
keeping
his
blue
eyes
fixed
on
the
river
,
*NL*
like
an
amphibious
animal
who
foresaw
occasion
for
darting
in
.
``
He
*NL*
lives
up
the
Kennel
Yard
at
Sut
Ogg
's
,
he
does
.
He
's
the
biggest
*NL*
rot-catcher
anywhere
,
he
is
.
I
'd
sooner
,
be
a
rot-catcher
nor
*NL*
anything
,
I
would
.
The
moles
is
nothing
to
the
rots
.
But
Lors
!

mun
*NL*
ha

ferrets
.
Dogs
is
no
good
.
Why
,
there
's
that
dog
,
now
!
''
Bob
*NL*
continued
,
pointing
with
an
air
of
disgust
toward
Yap
,
``
he
's
no
more
*NL*
good
wi
'
a
rot
nor
nothin

.
I
see
it
myself

I
did
,
at
the
*NL*
rot-catchin

i
'
your
feyther
's
barn
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Yap
,
feeling
the
withering
influence
of
this
scorn
,
tucked
his
tail
in
*NL*
and
shrank
close
to
Tom
's
leg
,
who
felt
a
little
hurt
for
him
,
but
had
*NL*
not
the
superhuman
courage
to
seem
behindhand
with
Bob
in
contempt
for
*NL*
a
dog
who
made
so
poor
a
figure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
''
he
said
,
``
Yap
's
no
good
at
sport
.
I
'll
have
regular
good
*NL*
dogs
for
rats
and
everything

I
've
done
school

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hev

Measter

''
said
Bob
,
eagerly
,
--
``

some
o

''
added
Bob
,
by
way
of
note
*NL*
or
addendum
,
after
a
moment
's
pause
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
I
say

Bob

''
said
Tom
,
in
a
tone
of
deliberation
,
``
ferrets
are

nasty
biting

'll
bite

*NL*
``

''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
moment
a
striking
incident
made
the
boys
pause
suddenly
in
*NL*
their
walk
.
It
was
the
plunging
of
some
small
body
in
the
water
from
*NL*
among
the
neighboring
bulrushes
;
if
it
was
not
a
water-rat
,
Bob
*NL*
intimated
that
he
was
ready
to
undergo
the
most
unpleasant
*NL*
consequences
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hoigh
!
Yap
,
--
hoigh
!
there
he
is
,
''
said
Tom
,
clapping
his
hands
,
as
*NL*
the
little
black
snout
made
its
arrowy
course
to
the
opposite
bank
.
*NL*
``
Seize
him
,
lad
!
seize
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Yap
agitated
his
ears
and
wrinkled
his
brows
,
but
declined
to
plunge
,
*NL*
trying
whether
barking
would
not
answer
the
purpose
just
as
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ugh
!
you
coward
!
''
said
Tom
,
and
kicked
him
over
,
feeling
humiliated
*NL*
as
a
sportsman
to
possess
so
poor-spirited
an
animal
.
Bob
abstained
*NL*
from
remark
and
passed
on
,
choosing
,
however
,
to
walk
in
the
shallow
*NL*
edge
of
the
overflowing
river
by
way
of
change
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
none
so
full
now
,
the
Floss
is
n't
,
''
said
Bob
,
as
he
kicked
the
*NL*
water
up
before
him
,
with
an
agreeable
sense
of
being
insolent
to
it
.
*NL*
``
Why
,
last
`
ear
,
the
meadows
was
all
one
sheet
o

water
,
they
was

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
but
,
''
said
Tom
,
whose
mind
was
prone
to
see
an
opposition
between
*NL*
statements
that
were
really
accordant
,
--
``
but
there
was
a
big
flood
*NL*
once
,
when
the
Round
Pool
was
made

_
I

know
there
was
,
'cause
father

says
so

And
the
sheep
and
cows
all
drowned
,
and
the
boats
went
all
*NL*
over
the
fields
ever
such
a
way
.

*NL*
*NL*
''
_
I
_
do

care
about

said
Bob
;
``
I
do

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
but
if
you
got
nothing
to
eat
for
ever
so
long
?
''
said
Tom
,
his
*NL*
imagination
becoming
quite
active
under
the
stimulus
of
that
dread
.
*NL*
``
When
I
'm
a
man

I
shall
make
a
boat
with

wooden
house
on
the
top

it
,
like
Noah

ark
,
and
keep
plenty
to
eat
in
it
,

rabbits
and
*NL*
things

all
ready

And
then
if
the
flood
came

you
know

Bob
,
I
*NL*
should
n't

I

take
you
in

saw
you
swimming

he
added
,
*NL*
in
the
tone
of
a
benevolent
patron
.

*NL*
``
I
are
n't
frighted
,
''
said
Bob
,
to
whom
hunger
did
not
appear
so
*NL*
appalling
.
``
But
I
'd
get
in
an
'
knock
the
rabbits
on
th

head
when
you
*NL*
wanted
to
eat
'em

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
and
I
should
have
halfpence
,
and
we
'd
play
at
heads-and-tails
,
''
*NL*
said
Tom
,
not
contemplating
the
possibility
that
this
recreation
might
*NL*
have
fewer
charms
for
his
mature
age
.
``
I
'd
divide
fair
to
begin
with

*NL*
and
then
we
'd
see
who
'd
win
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
got
a
halfpenny
o
'
my
own
,
''
said
Bob
,
proudly
,
coming
out
of
the
*NL*
water
and
tossing
his
halfpenny
in
the
air
.
``
Yeads
or
tails
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tails
,
''
said
Tom
,
instantly
fired
with
the
desire
to
win
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
yeads
,
''
said
Bob
,
hastily
,
snatching
up
the
halfpenny
as
it
*NL*
fell
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
n't
,
''
said
Tom
,
loudly
and
peremptorily
.
``
You
give
me
the
*NL*
halfpenny
;
I
've
won
it
fair
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
sha
'n'
t

''
said
Bob
,
holding
it
tight
in
his
pocket
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
'll
make
you
;
see
if
I
do
n't
,
''
said
Tom
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
can
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ca
n't
make
me
do
nothing
,
you
ca

''
said
Bob
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
you
ca

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
master
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
care
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
'll
make
you
care
,
you
cheat
,
''
said
Tom
,
collaring
Bob
and
*NL*
shaking
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
get
out
wi
'
you
,
''
said
Bob
,
giving
Tom
a
kick
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
's
blood
was
thoroughly
up
:
he
went
at
Bob
with
a
lunge
and
threw
*NL*
him
down
,
but
Bob
seized
hold
and
kept
it
like
a
cat
,
and
pulled
Tom
*NL*
down
after
him
.
They
struggled
fiercely
on
the
ground
for
a
moment
or
*NL*
two
,
till
Tom
,
pinning
Bob
down
by
the
shoulders
,
thought
he
had
the
*NL*
mastery
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
You
_
,
say
you
'll
give
me
the
halfpenny
now
,
''
he
said
,
with
*NL*
difficulty
,
while
he
exerted
himself
to
keep
the
command
of
Bob
's
*NL*
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
at
this
moment
Yap
,
who
had
been
running
on
before
,
returned
*NL*
barking
to
the
scene
of
action
,
and
saw
a
favorable
opportunity
for
*NL*
biting
Bob
's
bare
leg
not
only
with
inpunity
but
with
honor
.
The
pain
*NL*
from
Yap
's
teeth
,
instead
of
surprising
Bob
into
a
relaxation
of
his
*NL*
hold
,
gave
it
a
fiercer
tenacity
,
and
with
a
new
exertion
of
his
force
*NL*
he
pushed
Tom
backward
and
got
uppermost
.
But
now
Yap
,
who
could
get
*NL*
no
sufficient
purchase
before
,
set
his
teeth
in
a
new
place
,
so
that
*NL*
Bob
,
harassed
in
this
way
,
let
go
his
hold
of
Tom
,
and
,
almost
*NL*
throttling
Yap
,
flung
him
into
the
river
.
By
this
time
Tom
was
up
*NL*
again
,
and
before
Bob
had
quite
recovered
his
balance
after
the
act
of
*NL*
swinging
Yap
,
Tom
fell
upon
him
,
threw
him
down
,
and
got
his
knees
*NL*
firmly
on
Bob
's
chest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
give
me
the
halfpenny
now
,
''
said
Tom
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
it
,
''
said
Bob
,
sulkily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
sha
'n'
t
take
it
;
you
give
it
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bob
took
the
halfpenny
out
of
his
pocket
,
and
threw
it
away
from
him
*NL*
on
the
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
loosed
his
hold
,
and
left
Bob
to
rise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
the
halfpenny
lies
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
do
n't
want
your
halfpenny
;
I
*NL*
would
n't
have
kept
it
.
But
you
wanted
to
cheat
;
I
hate
a
cheat
.
I
*NL*
sha
'n'
t
go
along
with
you
any
more
,
''
he
added
,
turning
round
homeward
,
*NL*
not
without
casting
a
regret
toward
the
rat-catching
and
other
*NL*
pleasures
which
he
must
relinquish
along
with
Bob
's
society
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
let
it
alone
,
then
,
''
Bob
called
out
after
him
.
``
I
shall
cheat
*NL*
if
I
like
;
there
's
no
fun
i
'
playing
else
;
and
I
know
where
there
's
a
*NL*
goldfinch
's
nest
,
but
I
'll
take
care
_
you
_
do
n't
.
An
'
you
're
a
nasty
*NL*
fightin
'
turkey-cock
,
you
are
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
walked
on
without
looking
around
,
and
Yap
followed
his
example
,
*NL*
the
cold
bath
having
moderated
his
passions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
along
wi
'
you
,
then
,
wi
'
your
drowned
dog
;
I
would
n't
own
such
a
*NL*
dog
--
_
I
_
would
n't
,
''
said
Bob
,
getting
louder
,
in
a
last
effort
to
*NL*
sustain
his
defiance
.
But
Tom
was
not
to
be
provoked
into
turning
*NL*
round
,
and
Bob
's
voice
began
to
falter
a
little
as
he
said
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
'
I
'n
gi'en
you
everything
,
an
'
showed
you
everything
,
an
'
niver
*NL*
wanted
nothin
'
from
you
.
An
'
there
's
your
horn-handed
knife
,
then
as
*NL*
you
gi'en
me
.
''
Here
Bob
flung
the
knife
as
far
as
he
could
after
Tom
's
*NL*
retreating
footsteps
.
But
it
produced
no
effect
,
except
the
sense
in
*NL*
Bob
's
mind
that
there
was
a
terrible
void
in
his
lot
,
now
that
knife
*NL*
was
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
stood
still
till
Tom
had
passed
through
the
gate
and
disappeared
*NL*
behind
the
hedge
.
The
knife
would
do
not
good
on
the
ground
there
;
it
*NL*
would
n't
vex
Tom
;
and
pride
or
resentment
was
a
feeble
passion
in
*NL*
Bob
's
mind
compared
with
the
love
of
a
pocket-knife
.
His
very
fingers
*NL*
sent
entreating
thrills
that
he
would
go
and
clutch
that
familiar
*NL*
rough
buck
's
-
horn
handle
,
which
they
had
so
often
grasped
for
mere
*NL*
affection
,
as
it
lay
idle
in
his
pocket
.
And
there
were
two
blades
,
*NL*
and
they
had
just
been
sharpened
!
What
is
life
without
a
pocket-knife
*NL*
to
him
who
has
once
tasted
a
higher
existence
?
No
;
to
throw
the
handle
*NL*
after
the
hatchet
is
a
comprehensible
act
of
desperation
,
but
to
throw
*NL*
one
's
pocket-knife
after
an
implacable
friend
is
clearly
in
every
*NL*
sense
a
hyperbole
,
or
throwing
beyond
the
mark
.
So
Bob
shuffled
back
*NL*
to
the
spot
where
the
beloved
knife
lay
in
the
dirt
,
and
felt
quite
a
*NL*
new
pleasure
in
clutching
it
again
after
the
temporary
separation
,
in
*NL*
opening
one
blade
after
the
other
,
and
feeling
their
edge
with
his
*NL*
well-hardened
thumb
.
Poor
Bob
!
he
was
not
sensitive
on
the
point
of
*NL*
honor
,
not
a
chivalrous
character
.
That
fine
moral
aroma
would
not
*NL*
have
been
thought
much
of
by
the
public
opinion
of
Kennel
Yard
,
which
*NL*
was
the
very
focus
or
heart
of
Bob
's
world
,
even
if
it
could
have
made
*NL*
itself
perceptible
there
;
yet
,
for
all
that
,
he
was
not
utterly
a
*NL*
sneak
and
a
thief
as
our
friend
Tom
had
hastily
decided
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Tom
,
you
perceive
,
was
rather
a
Rhadamanthine
personage
,
having
*NL*
more
than
the
usual
share
of
boy
's
justice
in
him
,
--
the
justice
that
*NL*
desires
to
hurt
culprits
as
much
as
they
deserve
to
be
hurt
,
and
is
*NL*
troubled
with
no
doubts
concerning
the
exact
amount
of
their
deserts
.
*NL*
Maggie
saw
a
cloud
on
his
brow
when
he
came
home
,
which
checked
her
*NL*
joy
at
his
coming
so
much
sooner
than
she
had
expected
,
and
she
dared
*NL*
hardly
speak
to
him
as
he
stood
silently
throwing
the
small
*NL*
gravel-stones
into
the
mill-dam
.
It
is
not
pleasant
to
give
up
a
*NL*
rat-catching
when
you
have
set
your
mind
on
it
.
But
if
Tom
had
told
*NL*
his
strongest
feeling
at
that
moment
,
he
would
have
said
,
``
I
'd
do
just
*NL*
the
same
again
.
''
That
was
his
usual
mode
of
viewing
his
past
actions
;
*NL*
whereas
Maggie
was
always
wishing
she
had
done
something
different
.

Chapter
VII
*NL*
*NL*
Enter
the
Aunts
and
Uncles
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
Dodsons
were
certainly
a
handsome
family
,
and
Mrs.
Glegg
was
not
*NL*
the
least
handsome
of
the
sisters
.
As
she
sat
in
Mrs.
Tulliver
's
*NL*
arm-chair
,
no
impartial
observer
could
have
denied
that
for
a
woman
of
*NL*
fifty
she
had
a
very
comely
face
and
figure
,
though
Tom
and
Maggie
*NL*
considered
their
aunt
Glegg
as
the
type
of
ugliness
.
It
is
true
she
*NL*
despised
the
advantages
of
costume
,
for
though
,
as
she
often
observed
,
*NL*
no
woman
had
better
clothes
,
it
was
not
her
way
to
wear
her
new
things
*NL*
out
before
her
old
ones
.
Other
women
,
if
they
liked
,
might
have
their
*NL*
best
thread-lace
in
every
wash
;
but
when
Mrs.
Glegg
died
,
it
would
be
*NL*
found
that
she
had
better
lace
laid
by
in
the
right-hand
drawer
of
her
*NL*
wardrobe
in
the
Spotted
Chamber
than
ever
Mrs.
Wooll
of
St.
Ogg
's
had
*NL*
bought
in
her
life
,
although
Mrs.
Wooll
wore
her
lace
before
it
was
*NL*
paid
for
.
So
of
her
curled
fronts
:
Mrs.
Glegg
had
doubtless
the
*NL*
glossiest
and
crispest
brown
curls
in
her
drawers
,
as
well
as
curls
in
*NL*
various
degrees
of
fuzzy
laxness
;
but
to
look
out
on
the
week-day
*NL*
world
from
under
a
crisp
and
glossy
front
would
be
to
introduce
a
most
*NL*
dreamlike
and
unpleasant
confusion
between
the
sacred
and
the
secular
.
*NL*
Occasionally
,
indeed
,
Mrs.
Glegg
wore
one
of
her
third-best
fronts
on
*NL*
a
week-day
visit
,
but
not
at
a
sister
's
house
;
especially
not
at
Mrs.
*NL*
Tulliver
's
,
who
,
since
her
marriage
,
had
hurt
her
sister
's
feelings
*NL*
greatly
by
wearing
her
own
hair
,
though
,
as
Mrs.
Glegg
observed
to
*NL*
Mrs.
Deane
,
a
mother
of
a
family
,
like
Bessy
,
with
a
husband
always
*NL*
going
to
law
,
might
have
been
expected
to
know
better
.
But
Bessy
was
*NL*
always
weak
!
*NL*
*NL*
So
if
Mrs.
Glegg
's
front
to-day
was
more
fuzzy
and
lax
than
usual
,
she
*NL*
had
a
design
under
it
:
she
intended
the
most
pointed
and
cutting
*NL*
allusion
to
Mrs.
Tulliver
's
bunches
of
blond
curls
,
separated
from
*NL*
each
other
by
a
due
wave
of
smoothness
on
each
side
of
the
parting
.
*NL*
Mrs.
Tulliver
had
shed
tears
several
times
at
sister
Glegg
's
*NL*
unkindness
on
the
subject
of
these
unmatronly
curls
,
but
the
*NL*
consciousness
of
looking
the
handsomer
for
them
naturally
administered
*NL*
support
.
Mrs.
Glegg
chose
to
wear
her
bonnet
in
the
house
*NL*
to-day
,
--
untied
and
tilted
slightly
,
of
course
--
a
frequent
practice
of
*NL*
hers
when
she
was
on
a
visit
,
and
happened
to
be
in
a
severe
humor
:
*NL*
she
did
n't
know
what
draughts
there
might
be
in
strange
houses
.
For
*NL*
the
same
reason
she
wore
a
small
sable
tippet
,
which
reached
just
to
*NL*
her
shoulders
,
and
was
very
far
from
meeting
across
her
well-formed
*NL*
chest
,
while
her
long
neck
was
protected
by
a
_
chevaux-de-frise
_
of
*NL*
miscellaneous
frilling
.
One
would
need
to
be
learned
in
the
fashions
*NL*
of
those
times
to
know
how
far
in
the
rear
of
them
Mrs.
Glegg
's
*NL*
slate-colored
silk
gown
must
have
been
;
but
from
certain
*NL*
constellations
of
small
yellow
spots
upon
it
,
and
a
mouldy
odor
about
*NL*
it
suggestive
of
a
damp
clothes-chest
,
it
was
probable
that
it
*NL*
belonged
to
a
stratum
of
garments
just
old
enough
to
have
come
*NL*
recently
into
wear
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Glegg
held
her
large
gold
watch
in
her
hand
with
the
many-doubled
*NL*
chain
round
her
fingers
,
and
observed
to
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
who
had
just
*NL*
returned
from
a
visit
to
the
kitchen
,
that
whatever
it
might
be
by
*NL*
other
people
's
clocks
and
watches
,
it
was
gone
half-past
twelve
by
*NL*
hers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
what
ails
sister
Pullet
,
''
she
continued
.
``
It
used
to
be
*NL*
the
way
in
our
family
for
one
to
be
as
early
as
another
,
--
I
'm
sure
it
*NL*
was
so
in
my
poor
father
's
time
,
--
and
not
for
one
sister
to
sit
half
*NL*
an
hour
before
the
others
came
.
But
if
the
ways
o
'
the
family
are
*NL*
altered
,
it
sha
'n'
t
be
_
my
_
fault

_
I
'll
_
never
be
the
one
to
come
*NL*
into
a
house
when
all
the
rest
are
going
away
.
I
wonder
_
at
_
sister
*NL*
Deane
,
--
she
used
to
be
more
like
me
.
But
if
you
'll
take
my
advice
,
*NL*
Bessy
,
you
'll
put
the
dinner
forrard
a
bit
,
sooner
than
put
it
back
,
*NL*
because
folks
are
late
as
ought
to
ha

known
better

``
Oh
dear
,
there
's
no
fear
but
what
they

be
all
here

said
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
in
her
mild-peevish
tone
.
``
The

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Bessy
!
''
said
Mrs.
Glegg
,
with
a
bitter
smile
and
a
scarcely
*NL*
perceptible
toss
of
her
head
,
``
I
should
ha
'
thought
you
'd
known
your
*NL*
own
sister
better
.
I
never
_
did
_
eat
between
meals
,
and
I
'm
not
going
*NL*
to
begin
.
Not
but
what
I
hate
that
nonsense
of
having
your
dinner
at
*NL*
half-past
one
,
when
you
might
have
it
at
one
.
You
was
never
brought
up
*NL*
in
that
way
,
Bessy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
Jane
,
what
can
I
do
?
Mr.
Tulliver
does
n't
like
his
dinner
before
*NL*
two
o'clock
,
but
I
put
it
half
an
hour
earlier
because
o
'
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
I
know
how
it
is
with
husbands
,
--
they
're
for
putting
*NL*
everything
off
;
they
'll
put
the
dinner
off
till
after
tea
,
if
they
've
*NL*
got
wives
as
are
weak
enough
to
give
in
to
such
work
;
but
it
's
a
pity
*NL*
for
you
,
Bessy
,
as
you
have
n't
got
more
strength
o
'
mind
.
It
'll
be
*NL*
well
if
your
children
do
n't
suffer
for
it
.
And
I
hope
you
've
not
gone
*NL*
and
got
a
great
dinner
for
us
,
--
going
to
expense
for
your
sisters
,
as
*NL*
`
ud
sooner
eat
a
crust
o
'
dry
bread
nor
help
to
ruin
you
with
*NL*
extravagance
.
I
wonder
you
do
n't
take
pattern
by
your
sister
Deane
;
*NL*
she
's
far
more
sensible
.
And
here
you
've
got
two
children
to
provide
*NL*
for
,
and
your
husband
's
spent
your
fortin
i
'
going
to
law
,
and
's
*NL*
likely
to
spend
his
own
too
.
A
boiled
joint
,
as
you
could
make
broth
*NL*
of
for
the
kitchen
,
''
Mrs.
Glegg
added
,
in
a
tone
of
emphatic
protest
,
*NL*
``
and
a
plain
pudding
,
with
a
spoonful
o
'
sugar
,
and
no
spice
,
`
ud
be
*NL*
far
more
becoming
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
sister
Glegg
in
this
humor
,
there
was
a
cheerful
prospect
for
the
*NL*
day
.
Mrs.
Tulliver
never
went
the
length
of
quarrelling
with
her
,
any
*NL*
more
than
a
water-fowl
that
puts
out
its
leg
in
a
deprecating
manner
*NL*
can
be
said
to
quarrel
with
a
boy
who
throws
stones
.
But
this
point
of
*NL*
the
dinner
was
a
tender
one
,
and
not
at
all
new
,
so
that
Mrs.
Tulliver
*NL*
could
make
the
same
answer
she
had
often
made
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Tulliver
says
he
always
_
will
_
have
a
good
dinner
for
his
friends
*NL*
while
he
can
pay
for
it
,
''
she
said
;
``
and
he
's
a
right
to
do
as
he
*NL*
likes
in
his
own
house
,
sister
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Bessy
,
_
I
_
ca
n't
leave
your
children
enough
out
o
'
my
savings
*NL*
to
keep
'em
from
ruin
.
And
you
must
n't
look
to
having
any
o
'
Mr.
*NL*
Glegg
's
money
,
for
it
's
well
if
I
do
n't
go
first
,
--
he
comes
of
a
*NL*
long-lived
family
;
and
if
he
was
to
die
and
leave
me
well
for
my
life
,
*NL*
he
'd
tie
all
the
money
up
to
go
back
to
his
own
kin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
sound
of
wheels
while
Mrs.
Glegg
was
speaking
was
an
interruption
*NL*
highly
welcome
to
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
who
hastened
out
to
receive
sister
*NL*
Pullet
;
it
must
be
sister
Pullet
,
because
the
sound
was
that
of
a
*NL*
four-wheel
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Glegg
tossed
her
head
and
looked
rather
sour
about
the
mouth
at
*NL*
the
thought
of
the
``
four-wheel
.
''
She
had
a
strong
opinion
on
that
*NL*
subject
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sister
Pullet
was
in
tears
when
the
one-horse
chaise
stopped
before
*NL*
Mrs.
Tulliver
's
door
,
and
it
was
apparently
requisite
that
she
should
*NL*
shed
a
few
more
before
getting
out
;
for
though
her
husband
and
Mrs.
*NL*
Tulliver
stood
ready
to
support
her
,
she
sat
still
and
shook
her
head
*NL*
sadly
,
as
she
looked
through
her
tears
at
the
vague
distance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
whativer
is
the
matter
,
sister
?
''
said
Mrs.
Tulliver
.
She
was
not
*NL*
an
imaginative
woman
,
but
it
occurred
to
her
that
the
large
*NL*
toilet-glass
in
sister
Pullet
's
best
bedroom
was
possibly
broken
for
*NL*
the
second
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
reply
but
a
further
shake
of
the
head
,
as
Mrs.
Pullet
*NL*
slowly
rose
and
got
down
from
the
chaise
,
not
without
casting
a
glance
*NL*
at
Mr.
Pullet
to
see
that
he
was
guarding
her
handsome
silk
dress
from
*NL*
injury
.
Mr.
Pullet
was
a
small
man
,
with
a
high
nose
,
small
twinkling
*NL*
eyes
,
and
thin
lips
,
in
a
fresh-looking
suit
of
black
and
a
white
*NL*
cravat
,
that
seemed
to
have
been
tied
very
tight
on
some
higher
*NL*
principle
than
that
of
mere
personal
ease
.
He
bore
about
the
same
*NL*
relation
to
his
tall
,
good-looking
wife
,
with
her
balloon
sleeves
,
*NL*
abundant
mantle
,
and
a
large
befeathered
and
beribboned
bonnet
,
as
a
*NL*
small
fishing-smack
bears
to
a
brig
with
all
its
sails
spread
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
a
pathetic
sight
and
a
striking
example
of
the
complexity
*NL*
introduced
into
the
emotions
by
a
high
state
of
civilization
,
the
*NL*
sight
of
a
fashionably
dressed
female
in
grief
.
From
the
sorrow
of
a
*NL*
Hottentot
to
that
of
a
woman
in
large
buckram
sleeves
,
with
several
*NL*
bracelets
on
each
arm
,
an
architectural
bonnet
,
and
delicate
ribbon
*NL*
strings
,
what
a
long
series
of
gradations
!
In
the
enlightened
child
of
*NL*
civilization
the
abandonment
characteristic
of
grief
is
checked
and
*NL*
varied
in
the
subtlest
manner
,
so
as
to
present
an
interesting
problem
*NL*
to
the
analytic
mind
.
If
,
with
a
crushed
heart
and
eyes
half
blinded
*NL*
by
the
mist
of
tears
,
she
were
to
walk
with
a
too-devious
step
through
*NL*
a
door-place
,
she
might
crush
her
buckram
sleeves
too
,
and
the
deep
*NL*
consciousness
of
this
possibility
produces
a
composition
of
forces
by
*NL*
which
she
takes
a
line
that
just
clears
the
door-post
.
Perceiving
that
*NL*
the
tears
are
hurrying
fast
,
she
unpins
her
strings
and
throws
them
*NL*
languidly
backward
,
a
touching
gesture
,
indicative
,
even
in
the
*NL*
deepest
gloom
,
of
the
hope
in
future
dry
moments
when
cap-strings
will
*NL*
once
more
have
a
charm
.
As
the
tears
subside
a
little
,
and
with
her
*NL*
head
leaning
backward
at
the
angle
that
will
not
injure
her
bonnet
,
*NL*
she
endures
that
terrible
moment
when
grief
,
which
has
made
all
things
*NL*
else
a
weariness
,
has
itself
become
weary
;
she
looks
down
pensively
at
*NL*
her
bracelets
,
and
adjusts
their
clasps
with
that
pretty
studied
*NL*
fortuity
which
would
be
gratifying
to
her
mind
if
it
were
once
more
in
*NL*
a
calm
and
healthy
state
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Pullet
brushed
each
door-post
with
great
nicety
,
about
the
*NL*
latitude
of
her
shoulders
-LRB-
at
that
period
a
woman
was
truly
ridiculous
*NL*
to
an
instructed
eye
if
she
did
not
measure
a
yard
and
a
half
across
*NL*
the
shoulders
-RRB-
,
and
having
done
that
sent
the
muscles
of
her
face
in
*NL*
quest
of
fresh
tears
as
she
advanced
into
the
parlor
where
Mrs.
Glegg
*NL*
was
seated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
sister
,
you
're
late
;
what
's
the
matter
?
''
said
Mrs.
Glegg
,
*NL*
rather
sharply
,
as
they
shook
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Pullet
sat
down
,
lifting
up
her
mantle
carefully
behind
,
before
*NL*
she
answered
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
gone
,
''
unconsciously
using
an
impressive
figure
of
rhetoric
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
n't
the
glass
this
time
,
then
,
''
thought
Mrs.
Tulliver
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Died
the
day
before
yesterday
,
''
continued
Mrs.
Pullet
;
``
an
'
her
legs
*NL*
was
as
thick
as
my
body
,
''
'
she
added
,
with
deep
sadness
,
after
a
*NL*
pause
.
``
They
'd
tapped
her
no
end
o
'
times
,
and
the
water
--
they
say
you
*NL*
might
ha
'
swum
in
it
,
if
you
'd
liked
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Sophy
,
it
's
a
mercy

's
gone
,
then
,
whoever
she
may
be
,
''
said
*NL*
Mrs.
Glegg
,
with
the
promptitude
and
emphasis
of
a
mind
naturally
*NL*
clear
and
decided
;
``
but
I
ca
n't
think
who
you
're
talking
of
,
for
my
*NL*
part
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
_
I
_
know
,
''
said
Mrs.
Pullet
,
sighing
and
shaking
her
head
;
``
and
*NL*
there
is
n't
another
such
a
dropsy
in
the
parish
.
_
I
_
know
as
it
's
old
*NL*
Mrs.
Sutton
o
'
the
Twentylands
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
she
's
no
kin
o
'
yours
,
nor
much
acquaintance
as
I
've
ever
*NL*
heared
of
,
''
said
Mrs.
Glegg
,
who
always
cried
just
as
much
as
was
*NL*
proper
when
anything
happened
to
her
own
``
kin
,
''
but
not
on
other
*NL*
occasions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
so
much
acquaintance
as
I
've
seen
her
legs
when
they
was
like
*NL*
bladders
.
And
an
old
lady
as
had
doubled
her
money
over
and
over
*NL*
again
,
and
kept
it
all
in
her
own
management
to
the
last
,
and
had
her
*NL*
pocket
with
her
keys
in
under
her
pillow
constant
.
There
is
n't
many
*NL*
old
_
par_ish
`
ners
like
her
,
I
doubt

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
they
say
she
'd
took
as
much
physic
as

fill
a
wagon

observed
*NL*
Mr.
Pullet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
sighed
Mrs.
Pullet
,
``
she
'd
another
complaint
ever
so
many
years

was

she
said
to
me

I
went
to
see
her
last
Christmas

She
_
did

say
so
,
''
added
Mrs.
Pullet
,
beginning
to
cry
bitterly
again
;
*NL*
``
those
were
her
very
words

And

bid
to
the
funeral

*NL*
*NL*
``
Sophy

said
Mrs.
Glegg
,
unable
any
longer
to
contain
her
spirit
of
*NL*
rational
remonstrance

``
Sophy

I
wonder

at

ever
heard
of

You
could

fret
no
more
than
this
,
if

we

heared
as
our
cousin
Abbott
had
died
sudden
without
making
his
*NL*
will

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Pullet
was
silent
,
having
to
finish
her
crying
,
and
rather
*NL*
flattered
than
indignant
at
being
upbraided
for
crying
too
much
.
It
*NL*
was
not
everybody
who
could
afford
to
cry
so
much
about
their
*NL*
neighbors
who
had
left
them
nothing
;
but
Mrs.
Pullet
had
married
a
*NL*
gentleman
farmer
,
and
had
leisure
and
money
to
carry
her
crying
and
*NL*
everything
else
to
the
highest
pitch
of
respectability
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mrs.
Sutton
did
n't
die
without
making
her
will

said
Mr.
*NL*
Pullet
,
with
a
confused
sense
that
he
was
saying
something
to
sanction
*NL*
his
wife
's
tears
;
``
ours

a
rich
parish

Mrs.

And
she

*NL*
left
no
leggicies

on

left
it
all
in

*NL*
*NL*
``
There
was

Mrs.

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sure

said
Mrs.
Pullet
,
who
had
recovered
sufficiently
*NL*
to
take
off
her
veil
and
fold
it
carefully
,
``
it
's
a
nice
sort

's
troubled
with
the

asthmy
,

goes
to

every

He
told
me
about

it
himself

as
free
as
could
be

one
Sunday
when
he
came
to

He
wears
a

a
trembling
in

quite
a

he
said

feel
for

That
was
what
he
said
,

the
very
*NL*
words

Ah
!

sighed
Mrs.
Pullet
,
shaking
her
head
at
the
idea
that
*NL*
there
were
but
few
who
could
enter
fully
into
her
experiences
in
pink
*NL*
mixture
and
white
mixture
,
strong
stuff
in
small
bottles
,
and
weak
*NL*
stuff
in
large
bottles
,
damp
boluses
at
a
shilling
,
and
draughts
at
*NL*
eighteenpence
.
``
Sister
,
I
may
as
well
go
and
take
my
bonnet
off
now
.
*NL*
Did
you
see
as
the
cap-box
was
put
out
?
''
she
added
,
turning
to
her
*NL*
husband
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Pullet
,
by
an
unaccountable
lapse
of
memory
,
had
forgotten
it
,
and
*NL*
hastened
out
,
with
a
stricken
conscience
,
to
remedy
the
omission
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
'll
bring
it
upstairs
,
sister
,
''
said
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
wishing
to
go
*NL*
at
once
,
lest
Mrs.
Glegg
should
begin
to
explain
her
feelings
about
*NL*
Sophy
's
being
the
first
Dodson
who
ever
ruined
her
constitution
with
*NL*
doctor
's
stuff
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Tulliver
was
fond
of
going
upstairs
with
her
sister
Pullet
,
and
*NL*
looking
thoroughly
at
her
cap
before
she
put
it
on
her
head
,
and
*NL*
discussing
millinery
in
general
.
This
was
part
of
Bessy
's
weakness
*NL*
that
stirred
Mrs.
Glegg
's
sisterly
compassion
:
Bessy
went
far
too
well
*NL*
dressed
,
considering
;
and
she
was
too
proud
to
dress
her
child
in
the
*NL*
good
clothing
her
sister
Glegg
gave
her
from
the
primeval
strata
of
*NL*
her
wardrobe
;
it
was
a
sin
and
a
shame
to
buy
anything
to
dress
that
*NL*
child
,
if
it
was
n't
a
pair
of
shoes
.
In
this
particular
,
however
,
Mrs.
*NL*
Glegg
did
her
sister
Bessy
some
injustice
,
for
Mrs.
Tulliver
had
*NL*
really
made
great
efforts
to
induce
Maggie
to
wear
a
leghorn
bonnet
*NL*
and
a
dyed
silk
frock
made
out
of
her
aunt
Glegg
's
,
but
the
results
*NL*
had
been
such
that
Mrs.
Tulliver
was
obliged
to
bury
them
in
her
*NL*
maternal
bosom
;
for
Maggie
,
declaring
that
the
frock
smelt
of
nasty
*NL*
dye
,
had
taken
an
opportunity
of
basting
it
together
with
the
roast
*NL*
beef
the
first
Sunday
she
wore
it
,
and
finding
this
scheme
answer
,
she
*NL*
had
subsequently
pumped
on
the
bonnet
with
its
green
ribbons
,
so
as
to
*NL*
give
it
a
general
resemblance
to
a
sage
cheese
garnished
with
withered
*NL*
lettuces
.
I
must
urge
in
excuse
for
Maggie
,
that
Tom
had
laughed
at
*NL*
her
in
the
bonnet
,
and
said
she
looked
like
an
old
Judy
.
Aunt
Pullet
,
*NL*
too
,
made
presents
of
clothes
,
but
these
were
always
pretty
enough
to
*NL*
please
Maggie
as
well
as
her
mother
.
Of
all
her
sisters
,
Mrs.
Tulliver
*NL*
certainly
preferred
her
sister
Pullet
,
not
without
a
return
of
*NL*
preference
;
but
Mrs.
Pullet
was
sorry
Bessy
had
those
naughty
,
awkward
*NL*
children
;
she
would
do
the
best
she
could
by
them
,
but
it
was
a
pity
*NL*
they
were
n't
as
good
and
as
pretty
as
sister
Deane
's
child
.
Maggie
and
*NL*
Tom
,
on
their
part
,
thought
their
aunt
Pullet
tolerable
,
chiefly
*NL*
because
she
was
not
their
aunt
Glegg
.
Tom
always
declined
to
go
more
*NL*
than
once
during
his
holidays
to
see
either
of
them
.
Both
his
uncles
*NL*
tipped
him
that
once
,
of
course
;
but
at
his
aunt
Pullet
's
there
were
a
*NL*
great
many
toads
to
pelt
in
the
cellar-area
,
so
that
he
preferred
the
*NL*
visit
to
her
.
Maggie
shuddered
at
the
toads
,
and
dreamed
of
them
*NL*
horribly
,
but
she
liked
her
uncle
Pullet
's
musical
snuff-box
.
Still
,
*NL*
it
was
agreed
by
the
sisters
,
in
Mrs.
Tulliver
's
absence
,
that
the
*NL*
Tulliver
blood
did
not
mix
well
with
the
Dodson
blood
;
that
,
in
fact
,
*NL*
poor
Bessy
's
children
were
Tullivers
,
and
that
Tom
,
notwithstanding
he
*NL*
had
the
Dodson
complexion
,
was
likely
to
be
as
``
contrairy
''
as
his
*NL*
father
.
As
for
Maggie
,
she
was
the
picture
of
her
aunt
Moss
,
Mr.
*NL*
Tulliver
's
sister
,
--
a
large-boned
woman
,
who
had
married
as
poorly
as
*NL*
could
be
;
had
no
china
,
and
had
a
husband
who
had
much
ado
to
pay
his
*NL*
rent
.
But
when
Mrs.
Pullet
was
alone
with
Mrs.
Tulliver
upstairs
,
the
*NL*
remarks
were
naturally
to
the
disadvantage
of
Mrs.
Glegg
,
and
they
*NL*
agreed
,
in
confidence
,
that
there
was
no
knowing
what
sort
of
fright
*NL*
sister
Jane
would
come
out
next
.
But
their
_
tete-a-tete
_
was
curtailed
*NL*
by
the
appearance
of
Mrs.
Deane
with
little
Lucy
;
and
Mrs.
Tulliver
*NL*
had
to
look
on
with
a
silent
pang
while
Lucy
's
blond
curls
were
*NL*
adjusted
.
It
was
quite
unaccountable
that
Mrs.
Deane
,
the
thinnest
and
*NL*
sallowest
of
all
the
Miss
Dodsons
,
should
have
had
this
child
,
who
*NL*
might
have
been
taken
for
Mrs.
Tulliver
's
any
day
.
And
Maggie
always
*NL*
looked
twice
as
dark
as
usual
when
she
was
by
the
side
of
Lucy
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
to-day
,
when
she
and
Tom
came
in
from
the
garden
with
their
*NL*
father
and
their
uncle
Glegg
.
Maggie
had
thrown
her
bonnet
off
very
*NL*
carelessly
,
and
coming
in
with
her
hair
rough
as
well
as
out
of
curl
,
*NL*
rushed
at
once
to
Lucy
,
who
was
standing
by
her
mother
's
knee
.
*NL*
Certainly
the
contrast
between
the
cousins
was
conspicuous
,
and
to
*NL*
superficial
eyes
was
very
much
to
the
disadvantage
of
Maggie
though
a
*NL*
connoisseur
might
have
seen
``
points
''
in
her
which
had
a
higher
promise
*NL*
for
maturity
than
Lucy
's
natty
completeness
.
It
was
like
the
contrast
*NL*
between
a
rough
,
dark
,
overgrown
puppy
and
a
white
kitten
.
Lucy
put
up
*NL*
the
neatest
little
rosebud
mouth
to
be
kissed
;
everything
about
her
*NL*
was
neat
,
--
her
little
round
neck
,
with
the
row
of
coral
beads
;
her
*NL*
little
straight
nose
,
not
at
all
snubby
;
her
little
clear
eyebrows
,
*NL*
rather
darker
than
her
curls
,
to
match
hazel
eyes
,
which
looked
up
*NL*
with
shy
pleasure
at
Maggie
,
taller
by
the
head
,
though
scarcely
a
*NL*
year
older
.
Maggie
always
looked
at
Lucy
with
delight
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
fond
of
fancying
a
world
where
the
people
never
got
any
larger
*NL*
than
children
of
their
own
age
,
and
she
made
the
queen
of
it
just
like
*NL*
Lucy
,
with
a
little
crown
on
her
head
,
and
a
little
sceptre
in
her
*NL*
hand
--
only
the
queen
was
Maggie
herself
in
Lucy
's
form
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Lucy
,
''
she
burst
out
,
after
kissing
her
,
``
you
'll
stay
with
Tom
*NL*
and
me
,
wo
n't
you
?
Oh
,
kiss
her
,
Tom
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
,
too
,
had
come
up
to
Lucy
,
but
he
was
not
going
to
kiss
her
--
no
;
*NL*
he
came
up
to
her
with
Maggie
,
because
it
seemed
easier
,
on
the
whole
,
*NL*
than
saying
,
``
How
do
you
do
?
''
to
all
those
aunts
and
uncles
.
He
stood
*NL*
looking
at
nothing
in
particular
,
with
the
blushing
,
awkward
air
and
*NL*
semi-smile
which
are
common
to
shy
boys
when
in
company
,
--
very
much
as
*NL*
if
they
had
come
into
the
world
by
mistake
,
and
found
it
in
a
degree
*NL*
of
undress
that
was
quite
embarrassing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Heyday
!
''
said
aunt
Glegg
,
with
loud
emphasis
.
``
Do
little
boys
and
*NL*
gells
come
into
a
room
without
taking
notice
of
their
uncles
and
*NL*
aunts
?
That
was
n't
the
way
when
_
I
_
was
a
little
gell
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
and
speak
to
your
aunts
and
uncles
,
my
dears
,
''
said
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
*NL*
looking
anxious
and
melancholy
.
She
wanted
to
whisper
to
Maggie
a
*NL*
command
to
go
and
have
her
hair
brushed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
and
how
do
you
do
?
And
I
hope
you
're
good
children
,
are
you
?
''
*NL*
said
Aunt
Glegg
,
in
the
same
loud
,
emphatic
way
,
as
she
took
their
*NL*
hands
,
hurting
them
with
her
large
rings
,
and
kissing
their
cheeks
*NL*
much
against
their
desire
.
``
Look
up
,
Tom
,
look
up
.
Boys
as
go
to
*NL*
boarding-schools
should
hold
their
heads
up
.
Look
at
me
now
.
''
Tom
*NL*
declined
that
pleasure
apparently
,
for
he
tried
to
draw
his
hand
away
.
*NL*
``
Put
your
hair
behind
your
ears
,
Maggie
,
and
keep
your
frock
on
your
*NL*
shoulder
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Aunt
Glegg
always
spoke
to
them
in
this
loud
,
emphatic
way
,
as
if
she
*NL*
considered
them
deaf
,
or
perhaps
rather
idiotic
;
it
was
a
means
,
she
*NL*
thought
,
of
making
them
feel
that
they
were
accountable
creatures
,
and
*NL*
might
be
a
salutary
check
on
naughty
tendencies
.
Bessy
's
children
were
*NL*
so
spoiled
--
they
'd
need
have
somebody
to
make
them
feel
their
duty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
my
dears
,
''
said
aunt
Pullet
,
in
a
compassionate
voice
,
``
you
*NL*
grow
wonderful
fast
.
I
doubt
they
'll
outgrow
their
strength
,
''
she
*NL*
added
,
looking
over
their
heads
,
with
a
melancholy
expression
,
at
*NL*
their
mother
.
``
I
think
the
gell
has
too
much
hair
.
I
'd
have
it
thinned
*NL*
and
cut
shorter
,
sister
,
if
I
was
you
;
it
is
n't
good
for
her
health
.
*NL*
It
's
that
as
makes
her
skin
so
brown
,
I
should
n't
wonder
.
Do
n't
you
*NL*
think
so
,
sister
Deane
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
say
,
I
'm
sure
,
sister
,
''
said
Mrs.
Deane
,
shutting
her
lips
*NL*
close
again
,
and
looking
at
Maggie
with
a
critical
eye
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
''
said
Mr.
Tulliver
,
``
the
child
's
healthy
enough
;
there
's
*NL*
nothing
ails
her
.
There
's
red
wheat
as
well
as
white
,
for
that
matter
,
*NL*
and
some
like
the
dark
grain
best
.
But
it
`
ud
be
as
well
if
Bessy
`
ud
*NL*
have
the
child
's
hair
cut
,
so
as
it
`
ud
lie
smooth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
dreadful
resolve
was
gathering
in
Maggie
's
breast
,
but
it
was
*NL*
arrested
by
the
desire
to
know
from
her
aunt
Deane
whether
she
would
*NL*
leave
Lucy
behind
.
Aunt
Deane
would
hardly
ever
let
Lucy
come
to
see
*NL*
them
.
After
various
reasons
for
refusal
,
Mrs.
Deane
appealed
to
Lucy
*NL*
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
would
n't
like
to
stay
behind
without
mother
,
should
you
,
Lucy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
please
,
mother
,
''
said
Lucy
,
timidly
,
blushing
very
pink
all
over
*NL*
her
little
neck
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
done
,
Lucy
!
Let
her
stay
,
Mrs.
Deane
,
let
her
stay
,
''
said
Mr.
*NL*
Deane
,
a
large
but
alert-looking
man
,
with
a
type
of
_
physique
_
to
be
*NL*
seen
in
all
ranks
of
English
society
,
--
bald
crown
,
red
whiskers
,
full
*NL*
forehead
,
and
general
solidity
without
heaviness
.
You
may
see
noblemen
*NL*
like
Mr.
Deane
,
and
you
may
see
grocers
or
day-laborers
like
him
;
but
*NL*
the
keenness
of
his
brown
eyes
was
less
common
than
his
contour
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
held
a
silver
snuff-box
very
tightly
in
his
hand
,
and
now
and
then
*NL*
exchanged
a
pinch
with
Mr.
Tulliver
,
whose
box
was
only
*NL*
silver-mounted
,
so
that
it
was
naturally
a
joke
between
them
that
Mr.
*NL*
Tulliver
wanted
to
exchange
snuff-boxes
also
.
Mr.
Deane
's
box
had
been
*NL*
given
him
by
the
superior
partners
in
the
firm
to
which
he
belonged
,
*NL*
at
the
same
time
that
they
gave
him
a
share
in
the
business
,
in
*NL*
acknowledgment
of
his
valuable
services
as
manager
.
No
man
was
thought
*NL*
more
highly
of
in
St.
Ogg
's
than
Mr.
Deane
;
and
some
persons
were
even
*NL*
of
opinion
that
Miss
Susan
Dodson
,
who
was
once
held
to
have
made
the
*NL*
worst
match
of
all
the
Dodson
sisters
,
might
one
day
ride
in
a
better
*NL*
carriage
,
and
live
in
a
better
house
,
even
than
her
sister
Pullet
.
*NL*
There
was
no
knowing
where
a
man
would
stop
,
who
had
got
his
foot
into
*NL*
a
great
mill-owning
,
shipowning
business
like
that
of
Guest
&
Co.
,
*NL*
with
a
banking
concern
attached
.
And
Mrs.
Deane
,
as
her
intimate
*NL*
female
friends
observed
,
was
proud
and
``
having
''
enough
;
_
she
_
would
n't
*NL*
let
her
husband
stand
still
in
the
world
for
want
of
spurring
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Maggie
,
''
said
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
beckoning
Maggie
to
her
,
and
whispering
*NL*
in
her
ear
,
as
soon
as
this
point
of
Lucy
's
staying
was
settled
,
``
go
*NL*
and
get
your
hair
brushed
,
do
,
for
shame
.
I
told
you
not
to
come
in
*NL*
without
going
to
Martha
first
,
you
know
I
did
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tom
come
out
with
me
,
''
whispered
Maggie
,
pulling
his
sleeve
as
she
*NL*
passed
him
;
and
Tom
followed
willingly
enough
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
upstairs
with
me
,
Tom
,
''
she
whispered
,
when
they
were
outside
*NL*
the
door
.
``
There
's
something
I
want
to
do
before
dinner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
no
time
to
play
at
anything
before
dinner
,
''
said
Tom
,
whose
*NL*
imagination
was
impatient
of
any
intermediate
prospect
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
,
there
is
time
for
this
;
_
do
_
come
,
Tom
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
followed
Maggie
upstairs
into
her
mother
's
room
,
and
saw
her
go
at
*NL*
once
to
a
drawer
,
from
which
she
took
out
a
large
pair
of
scissors
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
they
for
,
Maggie
?
''
said
Tom
,
feeling
his
curiosity
awakened
.
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
answered
by
seizing
her
front
locks
and
cutting
them
straight
*NL*
across
the
middle
of
her
forehead
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
buttons
!
Maggie
,
you
'll
catch
it
!
''
exclaimed
Tom
;
``
you
'd
*NL*
better
not
cut
any
more
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Snip
!
went
the
great
scissors
again
while
Tom
was
speaking
,
and
he
*NL*
could
n't
help
feeling
it
was
rather
good
fun
;
Maggie
would
look
so
*NL*
queer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
,
Tom
,
cut
it
behind
for
me
,
''
said
Maggie
,
excited
by
her
own
*NL*
daring
,
and
anxious
to
finish
the
deed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
catch
it
,
you
know
,
''
said
Tom
,
nodding
his
head
in
an
*NL*
admonitory
manner
,
and
hesitating
a
little
as
he
took
the
scissors
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
mind
,
make
haste
!
''
said
Maggie
,
giving
a
little
stamp
with
her
*NL*
foot
.
Her
cheeks
were
quite
flushed
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
black
locks
were
so
thick
,
nothing
could
be
more
tempting
to
a
lad
*NL*
who
had
already
tasted
the
forbidden
pleasure
of
cutting
the
pony
's
*NL*
mane
.
I
speak
to
those
who
know
the
satisfaction
of
making
a
pair
of
*NL*
scissors
meet
through
a
duly
resisting
mass
of
hair
.
One
delicious
*NL*
grinding
snip
,
and
then
another
and
another
,
and
the
hinder-locks
fell
*NL*
heavily
on
the
floor
,
and
Maggie
stood
cropped
in
a
jagged
,
uneven
*NL*
manner
,
but
with
a
sense
of
clearness
and
freedom
,
as
if
she
had
*NL*
emerged
from
a
wood
into
the
open
plain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Maggie
,
''
said
Tom
,
jumping
round
her
,
and
slapping
his
knees
as
*NL*
he
laughed
,
``
Oh
,
my
buttons
!
what
a
queer
thing
you
look
!
Look
at
*NL*
yourself
in
the
glass
;
you
look
like
the
idiot
we
throw
out
nutshells
*NL*
to
at
school
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
felt
an
unexpected
pang
.
She
had
thought
beforehand
chiefly
at
*NL*
her
own
deliverance
from
her
teasing
hair
and
teasing
remarks
about
*NL*
it
,
and
something
also
of
the
triumph
she
should
have
over
her
mother
*NL*
and
her
aunts
by
this
very
decided
course
of
action
;
she
did
n't
want
*NL*
her
hair
to
look
pretty
,
--
that
was
out
of
the
question
,
--
she
only
*NL*
wanted
people
to
think
her
a
clever
little
girl
,
and
not
to
find
fault
*NL*
with
her
.
But
now
,
when
Tom
began
to
laugh
at
her
,
and
say
she
was
*NL*
like
an
idiot
,
the
affair
had
quite
a
new
aspect
.
She
looked
in
the
*NL*
glass
,
and
still
Tom
laughed
and
clapped
his
hands
,
and
Maggie
's
*NL*
cheeks
began
to
pale
,
and
her
lips
to
tremble
a
little
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Maggie
,
you
'll
have
to
go
down
to
dinner
directly
,
''
said
Tom
.
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
laugh
at
me
,
Tom
,
''
said
Maggie
,
in
a
passionate
tone
,
with
an
*NL*
outburst
of
angry
tears
,
stamping
,
and
giving
him
a
push
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
then
,
spitfire
!
''
said
Tom
.
``
What
did
you
cut
it
off
for
,
then
?
I
*NL*
shall
go
down
:
I
can
smell
the
dinner
going
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
hurried
downstairs
and
left
poor
Maggie
to
that
bitter
sense
of
the
*NL*
irrevocable
which
was
almost
an
every-day
experience
of
her
small
*NL*
soul
.
She
could
see
clearly
enough
,
now
the
thing
was
done
,
that
it
*NL*
was
very
foolish
,
and
that
she
should
have
to
hear
and
think
more
*NL*
about
her
hair
than
ever
;
for
Maggie
rushed
to
her
deeds
with
*NL*
passionate
impulse
,
and
then
saw
not
only
their
consequences
,
but
what
*NL*
would
have
happened
if
they
had
not
been
done
,
with
all
the
detail
and
*NL*
exaggerated
circumstance
of
an
active
imagination
.
Tom
never
did
the
*NL*
same
sort
of
foolish
things
as
Maggie
,
having
a
wonderful
instinctive
*NL*
discernment
of
what
would
turn
to
his
advantage
or
disadvantage
;
and
*NL*
so
it
happened
,
that
though
he
was
much
more
wilful
and
inflexible
*NL*
than
Maggie
,
his
mother
hardly
ever
called
him
naughty
.
But
if
Tom
did
*NL*
make
a
mistake
of
that
sort
,
he
espoused
it
,
and
stood
by
it
:
he
*NL*
``
did
n't
mind
.
''
If
he
broke
the
lash
of
his
father
's
gigwhip
by
lashing
*NL*
the
gate
,
he
could
n't
help
it
,
--
the
whip
should
n't
have
got
caught
in
*NL*
the
hinge
.
If
Tom
Tulliver
whipped
a
gate
,
he
was
convinced
,
not
that
*NL*
the
whipping
of
gates
by
all
boys
was
a
justifiable
act
,
but
that
he
,
*NL*
Tom
Tulliver
,
was
justifiable
in
whipping
that
particular
gate
,
and
he
*NL*
was
n't
going
to
be
sorry
.
But
Maggie
,
as
she
stood
crying
before
the
*NL*
glass
,
felt
it
impossible
that
she
should
go
down
to
dinner
and
endure
*NL*
the
severe
eyes
and
severe
words
of
her
aunts
,
while
Tom
and
Lucy
,
and
*NL*
Martha
,
who
waited
at
table
,
and
perhaps
her
father
and
her
uncles
,
*NL*
would
laugh
at
her
;
for
if
Tom
had
laughed
at
her
,
of
course
every
one
*NL*
else
would
;
and
if
she
had
only
let
her
hair
alone
,
she
could
have
sat
*NL*
with
Tom
and
Lucy
,
and
had
the
apricot
pudding
and
the
custard
!
What
*NL*
could
she
do
but
sob
?
She
sat
as
helpless
and
despairing
among
her
*NL*
black
locks
as
Ajax
among
the
slaughtered
sheep
.
Very
trivial
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
this
anguish
seems
to
weather-worn
mortals
who
have
to
think
*NL*
of
Christmas
bills
,
dead
loves
,
and
broken
friendships
;
but
it
was
not
*NL*
less
bitter
to
Maggie
--
perhaps
it
was
even
more
bitter
--
than
what
we
*NL*
are
fond
of
calling
antithetically
the
real
troubles
of
mature
life
.
*NL*
``
Ah
,
my
child
,
you
will
have
real
troubles
to
fret
about
by
and
by
,
''
*NL*
is
the
consolation
we
have
almost
all
of
us
had
administered
to
us
in
*NL*
our
childhood
,
and
have
repeated
to
other
children
since
we
have
been
*NL*
grown
up
.
We
have
all
of
us
sobbed
so
piteously
,
standing
with
tiny
*NL*
bare
legs
above
our
little
socks
,
when
we
lost
sight
of
our
mother
or
*NL*
nurse
in
some
strange
place
;
but
we
can
no
longer
recall
the
poignancy
*NL*
of
that
moment
and
weep
over
it
,
as
we
do
over
the
remembered
*NL*
sufferings
of
five
or
ten
years
ago
.
Every
one
of
those
keen
moments
*NL*
has
left
its
trace
,
and
lives
in
us
still
,
but
such
traces
have
blent
*NL*
themselves
irrecoverably
with
the
firmer
texture
of
our
youth
and
*NL*
manhood
;
and
so
it
comes
that
we
can
look
on
at
the
troubles
of
our
*NL*
children
with
a
smiling
disbelief
in
the
reality
of
their
pain
.
Is
*NL*
there
any
one
who
can
recover
the
experience
of
his
childhood
,
not
*NL*
merely
with
a
memory
_
of
_
what
he
did
and
what
happened
to
him
,
of
*NL*
what
he
liked
and
disliked
when
he
was
in
frock
and
trousers
,
but
with
*NL*
an
intimate
penetration
,
a
revived
consciousness
of
what
he
felt
then
,
*NL*
when
it
was
so
long
from
one
Midsummer
to
another
;
what
he
felt
when
*NL*
his
school
fellows
shut
him
out
of
their
game
because
he
would
pitch
*NL*
the
ball
wrong
out
of
mere
wilfulness
;
or
on
a
rainy
day
in
the
*NL*
holidays
,
when
he
did
n't
know
how
to
amuse
himself
,
and
fell
from
*NL*
idleness
into
mischief
,
from
mischief
into
defiance
,
and
from
defiance
*NL*
into
sulkiness
;
or
when
his
mother
absolutely
refused
to
let
him
have
*NL*
a
tailed
coat
that
``
half
,
''
although
every
other
boy
of
his
age
had
*NL*
gone
into
tails
already
?
Surely
if
we
could
recall
that
early
*NL*
bitterness
,
and
the
dim
guesses
,
the
strangely
perspectiveless
*NL*
conception
of
life
,
that
gave
the
bitterness
its
intensity
,
we
should
*NL*
not
pooh-pooh
the
griefs
of
our
children
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Maggie
,
you
're
to
come
down
this
minute
,
''
said
Kezia
,
entering
*NL*
the
room
hurriedly
.
``
Lawks
!
what
have
you
been
a-doing
?
I
never
_
see
_
*NL*
such
a
fright
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
,
Kezia
,
''
said
Maggie
,
angrily
.
``
Go
away
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
tell
you
you
're
to
come
down
,
Miss
,
this
minute
;
your
mother
*NL*
says
so
,
''
said
Kezia
,
going
up
to
Maggie
and
taking
her
by
the
hand
to
*NL*
raise
her
from
the
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Get
away
,
Kezia
;
I
do
n't
want
any
dinner
,
''
said
Maggie
,
resisting
*NL*
Kezia
's
arm
.
``
I
sha
'n'
t
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
well
,
I
ca
n't
stay
.
I
've
got
to
wait
at
dinner
,
''
said
Kezia
,
*NL*
going
out
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Maggie
,
you
little
silly
,
''
said
Tom
,
peeping
into
the
room
ten
*NL*
minutes
after
,
``
why
do
n't
you
come
and
have
your
dinner
?
There
's
lots
*NL*
o
'
goodies
,
and
mother
says
you
're
to
come
.
What
are
you
crying
for
,
*NL*
you
little
spooney
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Oh
,
it
was
dreadful
!
Tom
was
so
hard
and
unconcerned
;
if
_
he
_
had
been
*NL*
crying
on
the
floor
,
Maggie
would
have
cried
too
.
And
there
was
the
*NL*
dinner
,
so
nice
;
and
she
was
_
so
_
hungry
.
It
was
very
bitter
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Tom
was
not
altogether
hard
.
He
was
not
inclined
to
cry
,
and
did
*NL*
not
feel
that
Maggie
's
grief
spoiled
his
prospect
of
the
sweets
;
but
*NL*
he
went
and
put
his
head
near
her
,
and
said
in
a
lower
,
comforting
*NL*
tone
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wo
n't
you
come
,
then
,
Magsie
?
Shall
I
bring
you
a
bit
o
'
pudding
when
*NL*
I
've
had
mine
,
and
a
custard
and
things
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ye-e-es
,
''
said
Maggie
,
beginning
to
feel
life
a
little
more
*NL*
tolerable
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
''
said
Tom
,
going
away
.
But
he
turned
again
at
the
door
and
*NL*
said
,
``
But
you
'd
better
come
,
you
know
.
There
's
the
dessert
,
--
nuts
,
*NL*
you
know
,
and
cowslip
wine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
's
tears
had
ceased
,
and
she
looked
reflective
as
Tom
left
her
.
*NL*
His
good
nature
had
taken
off
the
keenest
edge
of
her
suffering
,
and
*NL*
nuts
with
cowslip
wine
began
to
assert
their
legitimate
influence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Slowly
she
rose
from
amongst
her
scattered
locks
,
and
slowly
she
made
*NL*
her
way
downstairs
.
Then
she
stood
leaning
with
one
shoulder
against
*NL*
the
frame
of
the
dining-parlour
door
,
peeping
in
when
it
was
ajar
.
She
*NL*
saw
Tom
and
Lucy
with
an
empty
chair
between
them
,
and
there
were
the
*NL*
custards
on
a
side-table
;
it
was
too
much
.
She
slipped
in
and
went
*NL*
toward
the
empty
chair
.
But
she
had
no
sooner
sat
down
than
she
*NL*
repented
and
wished
herself
back
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Tulliver
gave
a
little
scream
as
she
saw
her
,
and
felt
such
a
*NL*
``
turn
''
that
she
dropped
the
large
gravy-spoon
into
the
dish
,
with
the
*NL*
most
serious
results
to
the
table-cloth
.
For
Kezia
had
not
betrayed
*NL*
the
reason
of
Maggie
's
refusal
to
come
down
,
not
liking
to
give
her
*NL*
mistress
a
shock
in
the
moment
of
carving
,
and
Mrs.
Tulliver
thought
*NL*
there
was
nothing
worse
in
question
than
a
fit
of
perverseness
,
which
*NL*
was
inflicting
its
own
punishment
by
depriving
Maggie
of
half
her
*NL*
dinner
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Tulliver
's
scream
made
all
eyes
turn
towards
the
same
point
as
*NL*
her
own
,
and
Maggie
's
cheeks
and
ears
began
to
burn
,
while
uncle
*NL*
Glegg
,
a
kind-looking
,
white-haired
old
gentleman
,
said
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Heyday
!
what
little
gell
's
this
?
Why
,
I
do
n't
know
her
.
Is
it
some
*NL*
little
gell
you
've
picked
up
in
the
road
,
Kezia
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
she
's
gone
and
cut
her
hair
herself
,
''
said
Mr.
Tulliver
in
an
*NL*
undertone
to
Mr.
Deane
,
laughing
with
much
enjoyment
.
Did
you
ever
*NL*
know
such
a
little
hussy
as
it
is
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
little
miss
,
you
've
made
yourself
look
very
funny
,
''
said
Uncle
*NL*
Pullet
,
and
perhaps
he
never
in
his
life
made
an
observation
which
was
*NL*
felt
to
be
so
lacerating
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fie
,
for
shame
!
''
said
aunt
Glegg
,
in
her
loudest
,
severest
tone
of
*NL*
reproof
.
``
Little
gells
as
cut
their
own
hair
should
be
whipped
and
fed
*NL*
on
bread
and
water
,

not
come
and
sit
down
with
their
aunts
and
*NL*
uncles
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
ay
,
''
said
uncle
Glegg
,
meaning
to
give
a
playful
turn
to
this
*NL*
denunciation
,
``
she
must
be
sent
to
jail
,
I
think
,
and
they
'll
cut
the
*NL*
rest
of
her
hair
off
there
,
and
make
it
all
even
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
more
like
a
gypsy
nor
ever
,
''
said
aunt
Pullet
,
in
a
pitying
*NL*
tone
;
``
it
's
very
bad
luck

sister
,
as
the
gell

be
so
brown

fair
enough

it
'll
stand
in

life
to
be
so
*NL*
brown

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
a
naughty
child

as
'll
break
her
mother
's
heart

said
Mrs.
*NL*
Tulliver
,
with
the
tears
in
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
seemed
to
be
listening
to
a
chorus
of
reproach
and
derision
.
*NL*
Her
first
flush
came
from
anger
,
which
gave
her
a
transient
power
of
*NL*
defiance
,
and
Tom
thought
she
was
braving
it
out
,
supported
by
the
*NL*
recent
appearance
of
the
pudding
and
custard
.
Under
this
impression
,
*NL*
he
whispered
,
``
Oh
,
my
!
Maggie
,
I
told
you
you
'd
catch
it
.
''
He
meant
to
*NL*
be
friendly
,
but
Maggie
felt
convinced
that
Tom
was
rejoicing
in
her
*NL*
ignominy
.
Her
feeble
power
of
defiance
left
her
in
an
instant
,
her
*NL*
heart
swelled
,
and
getting
up
from
her
chair
,
she
ran
to
her
father
,
*NL*
hid
her
face
on
his
shoulder
,
and
burst
out
into
loud
sobbing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
come
,
my
wench
,
''
said
her
father
,
soothingly
,
putting
his
arm
*NL*
round
her
,
``
never
mind
;
you
was
i
'
the
right
to
cut
it
off
if
it
*NL*
plagued
you
;
give
over
crying
;
father
'll
take
your
part
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Delicious
words
of
tenderness
!
Maggie
never
forgot
any
of
these
*NL*
moments
when
her
father
``
took
her
part
''
;
she
kept
them
in
her
heart
,
*NL*
and
thought
of
them
long
years
after
,
when
every
one
else
said
that
*NL*
her
father
had
done
very
ill
by
his
children
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
your
husband
does
spoil
that
child
,
Bessy
!
''
said
Mrs.
Glegg
,
in
a
*NL*
loud
``
aside
,
''
to
Mrs.
Tulliver
.
``
It
'll
be
the
ruin
of
her
,
if
you
*NL*
do
n't
take
care
.
_
My
_
father
never
brought
his
children
up
so
,
else
we
*NL*
should
ha
'
been
a
different
sort
o
'
family
to
what
we
are
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Tulliver
's
domestic
sorrows
seemed
at
this
moment
to
have
reached
*NL*
the
point
at
which
insensibility
begins
.
She
took
no
notice
of
her
*NL*
sister
's
remark
,
but
threw
back
her
capstrings
and
dispensed
the
*NL*
pudding
,
in
mute
resignation
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
the
dessert
there
came
entire
deliverance
for
Maggie
,
for
the
*NL*
children
were
told
they
might
have
their
nuts
and
wine
in
the
*NL*
summer-house
,
since
the
day
was
so
mild
;
and
they
scampered
out
among
*NL*
the
budding
bushes
of
the
garden
with
the
alacrity
of
small
animals
*NL*
getting
from
under
a
burning
glass
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Tulliver
had
her
special
reason
for
this
permission
:
now
the
*NL*
dinner
was
despatched
,
and
every
one
's
mind
disengaged
,
it
was
the
*NL*
right
moment
to
communicate
Mr.
Tulliver
's
intention
concerning
Tom
,
*NL*
and
it
would
be
as
well
for
Tom
himself
to
be
absent
.
The
children
*NL*
were
used
to
hear
themselves
talked
of
as
freely
as
if
they
were
*NL*
birds
,
and
could
understand
nothing
,
however
they
might
stretch
their
*NL*
necks
and
listen
;
but
on
this
occasion
Mrs.
Tulliver
manifested
an
*NL*
unusual
discretion
,
because
she
had
recently
had
evidence
that
the
*NL*
going
to
school
to
a
clergyman
was
a
sore
point
with
Tom
,
who
looked
*NL*
at
it
as
very
much
on
a
par
with
going
to
school
to
a
constable
.
Mrs.
*NL*
Tulliver
had
a
sighing
sense
that
her
husband
would
do
as
he
liked
,
*NL*
whatever
sister
Glegg
said
,
or
sister
Pullet
either
;
but
at
least
they
*NL*
would
not
be
able
to
say
,
if
the
thing
turned
out
ill
,
that
Bessy
had
*NL*
fallen
in
with
her
husband
's
folly
without
letting
her
own
friends
*NL*
know
a
word
about
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Tulliver
,
''
she
said
,
interrupting
her
husband
in
his
talk
with
*NL*
Mr.
Deane
,
``
it
's
time
now
to
tell
the
children
's
aunts
and
uncles
what
*NL*
you
're
thinking
of
doing
with
Tom
,
is
n't
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
''
said
Mr.
Tulliver
,
rather
sharply
,
``
I
've
no
objections
to
*NL*
tell
anybody
what
I
mean
to
do
with
him
.
I
've
settled
,
''
he
added
,
*NL*
looking
toward
Mr.
Glegg
and
Mr.
Deane
,
--
``
I
've
settled
to
send
him
to
*NL*
a
Mr.
Stelling
,
a
parson
,
down
at
King
's
Lorton
,
there
,
--
an
uncommon
*NL*
clever
fellow
,
I
understand
,
as
'll
put
him
up
to
most
things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
rustling
demonstration
of
surprise
in
the
company
,
such
as
*NL*
you
may
have
observed
in
a
country
congregation
when
they
hear
an
*NL*
allusion
to
their
week-day
affairs
from
the
pulpit
.
It
was
equally
*NL*
astonishing
to
the
aunts
and
uncles
to
find
a
parson
introduced
into
*NL*
Mr.
Tulliver
's
family
arrangements
.
As
for
uncle
Pullet
,
he
could
*NL*
hardly
have
been
more
thoroughly
obfuscated
if
Mr.
Tulliver
had
said
*NL*
that
he
was
going
to
send
Tom
to
the
Lord
Chancellor
;
for
uncle
Pullet
*NL*
belonged
to
that
extinct
class
of
British
yeoman
who
,
dressed
in
good
*NL*
broadcloth
,
paid
high
rates
and
taxes
,
went
to
church
,
and
ate
a
*NL*
particularly
good
dinner
on
Sunday
,
without
dreaming
that
the
British
*NL*
constitution
in
Church
and
State
had
a
traceable
origin
any
more
than
*NL*
the
solar
system
and
the
fixed
stars
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
melancholy
,
but
true
,
that
Mr.
Pullet
had
the
most
confused
idea
*NL*
of
a
bishop
as
a
sort
of
a
baronet
,
who
might
or
might
not
be
a
*NL*
clergyman
;
and
as
the
rector
of
his
own
parish
was
a
man
of
high
*NL*
family
and
fortune
,
the
idea
that
a
clergyman
could
be
a
schoolmaster
*NL*
was
too
remote
from
Mr.
Pullet
's
experience
to
be
readily
conceivable
.
*NL*
I
know
it
is
difficult
for
people
in
these
instructed
times
to
believe
*NL*
in
uncle
Pullet
's
ignorance
;
but
let
them
reflect
on
the
remarkable
*NL*
results
of
a
great
natural
faculty
under
favoring
circumstances
.
And
*NL*
uncle
Pullet
had
a
great
natural
faculty
for
ignorance
.
He
was
the
*NL*
first
to
give
utterance
to
his
astonishment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
what
can
you
be
going
to
send
him
to
a
parson
for
?
''
he
said
,
*NL*
with
an
amazed
twinkling
in
his
eyes
,
looking
at
Mr.
Glegg
and
Mr.
*NL*
Deane
,
to
see
if
they
showed
any
signs
of
comprehension
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
because
the
parsons
are
the
best
schoolmasters
,
by
what
I
can
*NL*
make
out
,
''
said
poor
Mr.
Tulliver
,
who
,
in
the
maze
of
this
puzzling
*NL*
world
,
laid
hold
of
any
clue
with
great
readiness
and
tenacity
.
*NL*
``
Jacobs
at
th
'
academy
's
no
parson
,
and
he
's
done
very
bad
by
the
boy
;
*NL*
and
I
made
up
my
mind
,
if
I
send
him
to
school
again
,
it
should
be
to
*NL*
somebody
different
to
Jacobs
.
And
this
Mr.
Stelling
,
by
what
I
can
*NL*
make
out
,
is
the
sort
o
'
man
I
want
.
And
I
mean
my
boy
to
go
to
him
at
*NL*
Midsummer
,
''
he
concluded
,
in
a
tone
of
decision
,
tapping
his
snuff-box
*NL*
and
taking
a
pinch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
have
to
pay
a
swinging
half-yearly
bill
,
then
,
eh
,
Tulliver
?
*NL*
The
clergymen
have
highish
notions
,
in
general
,
''
said
Mr.
Deane
,
*NL*
taking
snuff
vigorously
,
as
he
always
did
when
wishing
to
maintain
a
*NL*
neutral
position
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
do
you
think
the
parson
'll
teach
him
to
know
a
good
sample
o
'
*NL*
wheat
when
he
sees
it
,
neighbor
Tulliver
?
''
said
Mr.
Glegg
,
who
was
*NL*
fond
of
his
jest
,
and
having
retired
from
business
,
felt
that
it
was
*NL*
not
only
allowable
but
becoming
in
him
to
take
a
playful
view
of
*NL*
things
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
you
see
,
I
've
got
a
plan
i
'
my
head
about
Tom
,

said
Mr.
*NL*
Tulliver
,
pausing
after
that
statement
and
lifting
up
his
glass
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
if
I
may
be
allowed
to
speak
,
and
it
's
seldom
as
I
am

''
said
*NL*
Mrs.
Glegg
,
with
a
tone
of
bitter
meaning
,
``

should
like
to
know
what
*NL*
good
is

to

his
fortin

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
''
said
Mr.
Tulliver
,
not
looking
at
Mrs.
Glegg
,
but
at
the
male
*NL*
part
of
his
audience
,
``
you
see

I
've
made
up
my

bring

I

had
my

along

*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Glegg
emitted
a
long
sort
of
guttural
sound
with
closed
lips
,
*NL*
that
smiled
in
mingled
pity
and
scorn
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

she
said
,
after

introductory
note

``

Mr.

was
getting
quite
an
insight

difficult

some

determined
to
*NL*
keep
it
corked
up
,
``

Mr.

up
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

said
Mrs.

sarcastically
.
``

said
Mrs.

Mr.

Mr.

*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
``

Mrs.

very
much
with
the

feeling
of
a

that
seizes
the
opportunity
of
diverting
his

toward
the
man
who
carries
no

*NL*
``

said
Mrs.

*NL*
beginning
to
cry
a
little
.

Mr.

burst
out

Mr.

in

out

*NL*
*NL*
``

with
the

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
Mr.

too
hot
to
be
damped
by
any

of

.
``

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
Mrs.

helplessly

``

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
Mr.

``
You

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
sisters
,
shall
we
go
and
look
at
the

''
said
Mrs.
*NL*
Tulliver
,
drying
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
proposition
could
have
been
more
seasonable
.
Mr.
Tulliver
felt
very
*NL*
much
as
if
the
air
had
been
cleared
of
obtrusive
flies
now
the
women
*NL*
were
out
of
the
room
.
There
were
few
things
he
liked
better
than
a
*NL*
chat
with
Mr.
Deane
,
whose
close
application
to
business
allowed
the
*NL*
pleasure
very
rarely
.
Mr.
Deane
,
he
considered
,
was
the
``
knowingest
''
*NL*
man
of
his
acquaintance
,
and
he
had
besides
a
ready
causticity
of
*NL*
tongue
that
made
an
agreeable
supplement
to
Mr.
Tulliver
's
own
*NL*
tendency
that
way
,
which
had
remained
in
rather
an
inarticulate
*NL*
condition
.
And
now
the
women
were
gone
,
they
could
carry
on
their
*NL*
serious
talk
without
frivolous
interruption
.
They
could
exchange
their
*NL*
views
concerning
the
Duke
of
Wellington
,
whose
conduct
in
the
Catholic
*NL*
Question
had
thrown
such
an
entirely
new
light
on
his
character
;
and
*NL*
speak
slightingly
of
his
conduct
at
the
battle
of
Waterloo
,
which
he
*NL*
would
never
have
won
if
there
had
n't
been
a
great
many
Englishmen
at
*NL*
his
back
,
not
to
speak
of
Blucher
and
the
Prussians
,
who
,
as
Mr.
*NL*
Tulliver
had
heard
from
a
person
of
particular
knowledge
in
that
*NL*
matter
,
had
come
up
in
the
very
nick
of
time
;
though
here
there
was
a
*NL*
slight
dissidence
,
Mr.
Deane
remarking
that
he
was
not
disposed
to
*NL*
give
much
credit
to
the
Prussians
,
--
the
build
of
their
vessels
,
*NL*
together
with
the
unsatisfactory
character
of
transactions
in
Dantzic
*NL*
beer
,
inclining
him
to
form
rather
a
low
view
of
Prussian
pluck
*NL*
generally
.
Rather
beaten
on
this
ground
,
Mr.
Tulliver
proceeded
to
*NL*
express
his
fears
that
the
country
could
never
again
be
what
it
used
*NL*
to
be
;
but
Mr.
Deane
,
attached
to
a
firm
of
which
the
returns
were
on
*NL*
the
increase
,
naturally
took
a
more
lively
view
of
the
present
,
and
*NL*
had
some
details
to
give
concerning
the
state
of
the
imports
,
*NL*
especially
in
hides
and
spelter
,
which
soothed
Mr.
Tulliver
's
*NL*
imagination
by
throwing
into
more
distant
perspective
the
period
when
*NL*
the
country
would
become
utterly
the
prey
of
Papists
and
Radicals
,
and
*NL*
there
would
be
no
more
chance
for
honest
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
Uncle
Pullet
sat
by
and
listened
with
twinkling
eyes
to
these
high
*NL*
matters
.
He
did
n't
understand
politics
himself
,
--
thought
they
were
a
*NL*
natural
gift
,
--
but
by
what
he
could
make
out
,
this
Duke
of
Wellington
*NL*
was
no
better
than
he
should
be
.

Mr.
Tulliver
Shows
His
Weaker
Side
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Suppose
sister
Glegg
should
call
her
money
in
;
it
`
ud
be
very
awkward
*NL*
for
you
to
have
to
raise
five
hundred
pounds
now
,
''
said
Mrs.
Tulliver
*NL*
to
her
husband
that
evening
,
as
she
took
a
plaintive
review
of
the
*NL*
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Tulliver
had
lived
thirteen
years
with
her
husband
,
yet
she
*NL*
retained
in
all
the
freshness
of
her
early
married
life
a
facility
of
*NL*
saying
things
which
drove
him
in
the
opposite
direction
to
the
one
she
*NL*
desired
.
Some
minds
are
wonderful
for
keeping
their
bloom
in
this
way
,
*NL*
as
a
patriarchal
goldfish
apparently
retains
to
the
last
its
youthful
*NL*
illusion
that
it
can
swim
in
a
straight
line
beyond
the
encircling
*NL*
glass
.
Mrs.
Tulliver
was
an
amiable
fish
of
this
kind
,
and
after
*NL*
running
her
head
against
the
same
resisting
medium
for
thirteen
years
*NL*
would
go
at
it
again
to-day
with
undulled
alacrity
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
observation
of
hers
tended
directly
to
convince
Mr.
Tulliver
that
*NL*
it
would
not
be
at
all
awkward
for
him
to
raise
five
hundred
pounds
;
*NL*
and
when
Mrs.
Tulliver
became
rather
pressing
to
know
_
how
_
he
would
*NL*
raise
it
without
mortgaging
the
mill
and
the
house
which
he
had
said
*NL*
he
never
_
would
_
mortgage
,
since
nowadays
people
were
none
so
ready
to
*NL*
lend
money
without
security
,
Mr.
Tulliver
,
getting
warm
,
declared
that
*NL*
Mrs.
Glegg
might
do
as
she
liked
about
calling
in
her
money
,
he
should
*NL*
pay
it
in
whether
or
not
.
He
was
not
going
to
be
beholden
to
his
*NL*
wife
's
sisters
.
When
a
man
had
married
into
a
family
where
there
was
a
*NL*
whole
litter
of
women
,
he
might
have
plenty
to
put
up
with
if
he
*NL*
chose
.
But
Mr.
Tulliver
did
_
not
_
choose
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Tulliver
cried
a
little
in
a
trickling
,
quiet
way
as
she
put
on
*NL*
her
nightcap
;
but
presently
sank
into
a
comfortable
sleep
,
lulled
by
*NL*
the
thought
that
she
would
talk
everything
over
with
her
sister
Pullet
*NL*
to-morrow
,
when
she
was
to
take
the
children
to
Garum
Firs
to
tea
.
Not
*NL*
that
she
looked
forward
to
any
distinct
issue
from
that
talk
;
but
it
*NL*
seemed
impossible
that
past
events
should
be
so
obstinate
as
to
remain
*NL*
unmodified
when
they
were
complained
against
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
husband
lay
awake
rather
longer
,
for
he
too
was
thinking
of
a
*NL*
visit
he
would
pay
on
the
morrow
;
and
his
ideas
on
the
subject
were
*NL*
not
of
so
vague
and
soothing
a
kind
as
those
of
his
amiable
partner
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Tulliver
,
when
under
the
influence
of
a
strong
feeling
,
had
a
*NL*
promptitude
in
action
that
may
seem
inconsistent
with
that
painful
*NL*
sense
of
the
complicated
,
puzzling
nature
of
human
affairs
under
which
*NL*
his
more
dispassionate
deliberations
were
conducted
;
but
it
is
really
*NL*
not
improbable
that
there
was
a
direct
relation
between
these
*NL*
apparently
contradictory
phenomena
,
since
I
have
observed
that
for
*NL*
getting
a
strong
impression
that
a
skein
is
tangled
there
is
nothing
*NL*
like
snatching
hastily
at
a
single
thread
.
It
was
owing
to
this
*NL*
promptitude
that
Mr.
Tulliver
was
on
horseback
soon
after
dinner
the
*NL*
next
day
-LRB-
he
was
not
dyspeptic
-RRB-
on
his
way
to
Basset
to
see
his
sister
*NL*
Moss
and
her
husband
.
For
having
made
up
his
mind
irrevocably
that
he
*NL*
would
pay
Mrs.
Glegg
her
loan
of
five
hundred
pounds
,
it
naturally
*NL*
occurred
to
him
that
he
had
a
promissory
note
for
three
hundred
pounds
*NL*
lent
to
his
brother-in-law
Moss
;
and
if
the
said
brother-in-law
could
*NL*
manage
to
pay
in
the
money
within
a
given
time
,
it
would
go
far
to
*NL*
lessen
the
fallacious
air
of
inconvenience
which
Mr.
Tulliver
's
*NL*
spirited
step
might
have
worn
in
the
eyes
of
weak
people
who
require
*NL*
to
know
precisely
_
how
_
a
thing
is
to
be
done
before
they
are
strongly
*NL*
confident
that
it
will
be
easy
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
Mr.
Tulliver
was
in
a
position
neither
new
nor
striking
,
but
,
like
*NL*
other
every-day
things
,
sure
to
have
a
cumulative
effect
that
will
be
*NL*
felt
in
the
long
run
:
he
was
held
to
be
a
much
more
substantial
man
*NL*
than
he
really
was
.
And
as
we
are
all
apt
to
believe
what
the
world
*NL*
believes
about
us
,
it
was
his
habit
to
think
of
failure
and
ruin
with
*NL*
the
same
sort
of
remote
pity
with
which
a
spare
,
long-necked
man
hears
*NL*
that
his
plethoric
short-necked
neighbor
is
stricken
with
apoplexy
.
He
*NL*
had
been
always
used
to
hear
pleasant
jokes
about
his
advantages
as
a
*NL*
man
who
worked
his
own
mill
,
and
owned
a
pretty
bit
of
land
;
and
these
*NL*
jokes
naturally
kept
up
his
sense
that
he
was
a
man
of
considerable
*NL*
substance
.
They
gave
a
pleasant
flavor
to
his
glass
on
a
market-day
,
*NL*
and
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
recurrence
of
half-yearly
payments
,
Mr.
*NL*
Tulliver
would
really
have
forgotten
that
there
was
a
mortgage
of
two
*NL*
thousand
pounds
on
his
very
desirable
freehold
.
That
was
not
*NL*
altogether
his
own
fault
,
since
one
of
the
thousand
pounds
was
his
*NL*
sister
's
fortune
,
which
he
had
to
pay
on
her
marriage
;
and
a
man
who
*NL*
has
neighbors
that
_
will
_
go
to
law
with
him
is
not
likely
to
pay
off
*NL*
his
mortgages
,
especially
if
he
enjoys
the
good
opinion
of
*NL*
acquaintances
who
want
to
borrow
a
hundred
pounds
on
security
too
*NL*
lofty
to
be
represented
by
parchment
.
Our

Mr.
Tulliver
had
a
*NL*
good-natured
fibre
in
him
,
and
did
not
like
to
give
harsh
refusals
*NL*
even
to
his
sister
,
who
had
not
only
come
in
to
the
world
in
that
*NL*
superfluous
way
characteristic
of
sisters
,
creating
a
necessity
for
*NL*
mortgages
,
but
had
quite
thrown
herself
away
in
marriage
,
and
had
*NL*
crowned
her
mistakes
by
having
an
eighth
baby
.
On
this
point
Mr.
*NL*
Tulliver
was
conscious
of
being
a
little
weak
;
but
he
apologized
to
*NL*
himself
by
saying
that
poor
Gritty
had
been
a
good-looking
wench
*NL*
before
she
married
Moss
;
he
would
sometimes
say
this
even
with
a
*NL*
slight
tremulousness
in
his
voice
.
But
this
morning
he
was
in
a
mood
*NL*
more
becoming
a
man
of
business
,
and
in
the
course
of
his
ride
along
*NL*
the
Basset
lanes
,
with
their
deep
ruts
,
--
lying
so
far
away
from
a
*NL*
market-town
that
the
labor
of
drawing
produce
and
manure
was
enough
to
*NL*
take
away
the
best
part
of
the
profits
on
such
poor
land
as
that
*NL*
parish
was
made
of
,
--
he
got
up
a
due
amount
of
irritation
against
Moss
*NL*
as
a
man
without
capital
,
who
,
if
murrain
and
blight
were
abroad
,
was
*NL*
sure
to
have
his
share
of
them
,
and
who
,
the
more
you
tried
to
help
*NL*
him
out
of
the
mud
,
would
sink
the
further
in
.
It
would
do
him
good
*NL*
rather
than
harm
,
now
,
if
he
were
obliged
to
raise
this
three
hundred
*NL*
pounds
;
it
would
make
him
look
about
him
better
,
and
not
act
so
*NL*
foolishly
about
his
wool
this
year
as
he
did
the
last
;
in
fact
,
Mr.
*NL*
Tulliver
had
been
too
easy
with
his
brother-in-law
,
and
because
he
had
*NL*
let
the
interest
run
on
for
two
years
,
Moss
was
likely
enough
to
think
*NL*
that
he
should
never
be
troubled
about
the
principal
.
But
Mr.
Tulliver
*NL*
was
determined
not
to
encourage
such
shuffling
people
any
longer
;
and
*NL*
a
ride
along
the
Basset
lanes
was
not
likely
to
enervate
a
man
's
*NL*
resolution
by
softening
his
temper
.
The
deep-trodden
hoof-marks
,
made
*NL*
in
the
muddiest
days
of
winter
,
gave
him
a
shake
now
and
then
which
*NL*
suggested
a
rash
but
stimulating
snarl
at
the
father
of
lawyers
,
who
,
*NL*
whether
by
means
of
his
hoof
or
otherwise
,
had
doubtless
something
to
*NL*
do
with
this
state
of
the
roads
;
and
the
abundance
of
foul
land
and
*NL*
neglected
fences
that
met
his
eye
,
though
they
made
no
part
of
his
*NL*
brother
Moss
's
farm
,
strongly
contributed
to
his
dissatisfaction
with
*NL*
that
unlucky
agriculturist
.
If
this
was
n't
Moss
's
fallow
,
it
might
*NL*
have
been
;
Basset
was
all
alike
;
it
was
a
beggarly
parish
,
in
Mr.
*NL*
Tulliver
's
opinion
,
and
his
opinion
was
certainly
not
groundless
.
*NL*
Basset
had
a
poor
soil
,
poor
roads
,
a
poor
non-resident
landlord
,
a
*NL*
poor
non-resident
vicar
,
and
rather
less
than
half
a
curate
,
also
*NL*
poor
.
If
any
one
strongly
impressed
with
the
power
of
the
human
mind
*NL*
to
triumph
over
circumstances
will
contend
that
the
parishioners
of
*NL*
Basset
might
nevertheless
have
been
a
very
superior
class
of
people
,
I
*NL*
have
nothing
to
urge
against
that
abstract
proposition
;
I
only
know
*NL*
that
,
in
point
of
fact
,
the
Basset
mind
was
in
strict
keeping
with
its
*NL*
circumstances
.
The
muddy
lanes
,
green
or
clayey
,
that
seemed
to
the
*NL*
unaccustomed
eye
to
lead
nowhere
but
into
each
other
,
did
really
lead
,
*NL*
with
patience
,
to
a
distant
high-road
;
but
there
were
many
feet
in
*NL*
Basset
which
they
led
more
frequently
to
a
centre
of
dissipation
,
*NL*
spoken
of
formerly
as
the
``
Markis
o
'
Granby
,
''
but
among
intimates
as
*NL*
``
Dickison
's
.
''
A
large
low
room
with
a
sanded
floor
;
a
cold
scent
of
*NL*
tobacco
,
modified
by
undetected
beer-dregs
;
Mr.
Dickison
leaning
*NL*
against
the
door-post
with
a
melancholy
pimpled
face
,
looking
as
*NL*
irrelevant
to
the
daylight
as
a
last
night
's
guttered
candle
,
--
all
*NL*
this
may
not
seem
a
very
seductive
form
of
temptation
;
but
the
*NL*
majority
of
men
in
Basset
found
it
fatally
alluring
when
encountered
*NL*
on
their
road
toward
four
o'clock
on
a
wintry
afternoon
;
and
if
any
*NL*
wife
in
Basset
wished
to
indicate
that
her
husband
was
not
a
*NL*
pleasure-seeking
man
,
she
could
hardly
do
it
more
emphatically
than
by
*NL*
saying
that
he
did
n't
spend
a
shilling
at
Dickison
's
from
one
*NL*
Whitsuntide
to
another
.
Mrs.
Moss
had
said
so
of
_
her
_
husband
more
*NL*
than
once
,
when
her
brother
was
in
a
mood
to
find
fault
with
him
,
as
*NL*
he
certainly
was
to-day
.
And
nothing
could
be
less
pacifying
to
Mr.
*NL*
Tulliver
than
the
behavior
of
the
farmyard
gate
,
which
he
no
sooner
*NL*
attempted
to
push
open
with
his
riding-stick
than
it
acted
as
gates
*NL*
without
the
upper
hinge
are
known
to
do
,
to
the
peril
of
shins
,
*NL*
whether
equine
or
human
.
He
was
about
to
get
down
and
lead
his
horse
*NL*
through
the
damp
dirt
of
the
hollow
farmyard
,
shadowed
drearily
by
the
*NL*
large
half-timbered
buildings
,
up
to
the
long
line
of
tumble-down
*NL*
dwelling-houses
standing
on
a
raised
causeway
;
but
the
timely
*NL*
appearance
of
a
cowboy
saved
him
that
frustration
of
a
plan
he
had
*NL*
determined
on
,
--
namely
,
not
to
get
down
from
his
horse
during
this
*NL*
visit
.
If
a
man
means
to
be
hard
,
let
him
keep
in
his
saddle
and
speak
*NL*
from
that
height
,
above
the
level
of
pleading
eyes
,
and
with
the
*NL*
command
of
a
distant
horizon
.
Mrs.
Moss
heard
the
sound
of
the
horse
's
*NL*
feet
,
and
,
when
her
brother
rode
up
,
was
already
outside
the
kitchen
*NL*
door
,
with
a
half-weary
smile
on
her
face
,
and
a
black-eyed
baby
in
*NL*
her
arms
.
Mrs.
Moss
's
face
bore
a
faded
resemblance
to
her
brother
's
;
*NL*
baby
's
little
fat
hand
,
pressed
against
her
cheek
,
seemed
to
show
more
*NL*
strikingly
that
the
cheek
was
faded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Brother
,
I
'm
glad
to
see
you
,
''
she
said
,
in
an
affectionate
tone
.
``
I
*NL*
did
n't
look
for
you
to-day
.
How
do
you
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
pretty
well
,
Mrs.
Moss
,
pretty
well
,
''
answered
the
brother
,
with
*NL*
cool
deliberation
,
as
if
it
were
rather
too
forward
of
her
to
ask
that
*NL*
question
.
She
knew
at
once
that
her
brother
was
not
in
a
good
humor
;
*NL*
he
never
called
her
Mrs.
Moss
except
when
he
was
angry
,
and
when
they
*NL*
were
in
company
.
But
she
thought
it
was
in
the
order
of
nature
that
*NL*
people
who
were
poorly
off
should
be
snubbed
.
Mrs.
Moss
did
not
take
*NL*
her
stand
on
the
equality
of
the
human
race
;
she
was
a
patient
,
*NL*
prolific
,
loving-hearted
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
husband
is
n't
in
the
house
,
I
suppose
?
''
added
Mr.
Tulliver
after
*NL*
a
grave
pause
,
during
which
four
children
had
run
out
,
like
chickens
*NL*
whose
mother
has
been
suddenly
in
eclipse
behind
the
hen-coop
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Mrs.
Moss
,
``
but
he
's
only
in
the
potato-field
yonders
.
*NL*
Georgy
,
run
to
the
Far
Close
in
a
minute
,
and
tell
father
your
uncle
's
*NL*
come
.
You
'll
get
down
,
brother
,
wo
n't
you
,
and
take
something
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
;
I
ca
n't
get
down
.
I
must
be
going
home
again
directly
,
''
said
*NL*
Mr.
Tulliver
,
looking
at
the
distance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
's
Mrs.
Tulliver
and
the
children
?
''
said
Mrs.
Moss
,
humbly
,
*NL*
not
daring
to
press
her
invitation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
pretty
well
.
Tom
's
going
to
a
new
school
at
Midsummer
,
--
a
deal
of
*NL*
expense
to
me
.
It
's
bad
work
for
me
,
lying
out
o
'
my
money
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
you
'd
be
so
good
as
let
the
children
come
and
see
their
*NL*
cousins
some
day
.
My
little
uns
want
to
see
their
cousin
Maggie
so
as
*NL*
never
was
.
And
me
her
godmother
,
and
so
fond
of
her
;
there
's
nobody
*NL*
`
ud
make
a
bigger
fuss
with
her
,
according
to
what
they
've
got
.
And
I
*NL*
know
she
likes
to
come
,
for
she
's
a
loving
child
,
and
how
quick
and
*NL*
clever
she
is
,
to
be
sure
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
If
Mrs.
Moss
had
been
one
of
the
most
astute
women
in
the
world
,
*NL*
instead
of
being
one
of
the
simplest
,
she
could
have
thought
of
*NL*
nothing
more
likely
to
propitiate
her
brother
than
this
praise
of
*NL*
Maggie
.
He
seldom
found
any
one
volunteering
praise
of
``
the
little
*NL*
wench
''
;
it
was
usually
left
entirely
to
himself
to
insist
on
her
*NL*
merits
.
But
Maggie
always
appeared
in
the
most
amiable
light
at
her
*NL*
aunt
Moss
's
;
it
was
her
Alsatia
,
where
she
was
out
of
the
reach
of
*NL*
law
,
--
if
she
upset
anything
,
dirtied
her
shoes
,
or
tore
her
frock
,
*NL*
these
things
were
matters
of
course
at
her
aunt
Moss
's
.
In
spite
of
*NL*
himself
,
Mr.
Tulliver
's
eyes
got
milder
,
and
he
did
not
look
away
from
*NL*
his
sister
as
he
said
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
;
she
's
fonder
o
'
you
than
o
'
the
other
aunts
,
I
think
.
She
takes
*NL*
after
our
family
:
not
a
bit
of
her
mother
's
in
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Moss
says
she
's
just
like
what
I
used
to
be
,
''
said
Mrs.
Moss
,
``
though
*NL*
I
was
never
so
quick
and
fond
o
'
the
books

But
I
think
my
Lizzy

*NL*
like
her
;
_
she
's
_
sharp
.
Come
here
,
Lizzy
,
my
dear
,
and
let
your
uncle
*NL*
see
you
;
he
hardly
knows
you
,
you
grow
so
fast
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lizzy
,
a
black-eyed
child
of
seven
,
looked
very
shy
when
her
mother
*NL*
drew
her
forward
,
for
the
small
Mosses
were
much
in
awe
of
their
uncle
*NL*
from
Dorlcote
Mill
.
She
was
inferior
enough
to
Maggie
in
fire
and
*NL*
strength
of
expression
to
make
the
resemblance
between
the
two
*NL*
entirely
flattering
to
Mr.
Tulliver
's
fatherly
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
they
're
a
bit
alike
,
''
he
said
,
looking
kindly
at
the
little
*NL*
figure
in
the
soiled
pinafore
.
``
They
both
take
after
our
mother
.
*NL*
You
've
got
enough
o
'
gells
,
Gritty
,
''
he
added
,
in
a
tone
half
*NL*
compassionate
,
half
reproachful
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Four
of
'em
,
bless
'em
!
''
said
Mrs.
Moss
,
with
a
sigh
,
stroking
*NL*
Lizzy
's
hair
on
each
side
of
her
forehead
;
``
as
many
as
there
's
boys
.
*NL*
They
've
got
a
brother
apiece
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
but
they
must
turn
out
and
fend
for
themselves
,
''
said
Mr.
*NL*
Tulliver
,
feeling
that
his
severity
was
relaxing
and
trying
to
brace
*NL*
it
by
throwing
out
a
wholesome
hint
``
They
must
n't
look
to
hanging
on
*NL*
their
brothers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
but
I
hope
their
brothers
`
ull
love
the
poor
things
,
and
remember
*NL*
they
came
o

one
father
and
mother
;
the
lads
`
ull
never
be
the
poorer
*NL*
for
that
,
''
said
Mrs.
Moss
,
flashing
out
with
hurried
timidity
,
like
a
*NL*
half-smothered
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Tulliver
gave
his
horse
a
little
stroke
on
the
flank
,
then
checked
*NL*
it
,
and
said
angrily
,
``
Stand
still
with
you
!
''
much
to
the
astonishment
*NL*
of
that
innocent
animal
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
the
more
there
is
of
'em
,
the
more
they
must
love
one
another
,
''
*NL*
Mrs.
Moss
went
on
,
looking
at
her
children
with
a
didactic
purpose
.
*NL*
But
she
turned
toward
her
brother
again
to
say
,
``
Not
but
what
I
hope
*NL*
your
boy
`
ull
allays
be
good
to
his
sister

though
there
's
but
two
of
*NL*
'em
,
like
you
and
me
,
brother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
arrow
went
straight
to
Mr.
Tulliver
's
heart
.
He
had
not
a
rapid
*NL*
imagination
,
but
the
thought
of
Maggie
was
very
near
to
him
,
and
he
*NL*
was
not
long
in
seeing
his
relation
to
his
own
sister
side
by
side
*NL*
with
Tom
's
relation
to
Maggie
.
Would
the
little
wench
ever
be
poorly
*NL*
off
,
and
Tom
rather
hard
upon
her
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
ay
,
Gritty
,
''
said
the
miller
,
with
a
new
softness
in
his
tone
;
*NL*
``
but
I
've
allays
done
what
I
could
for
you

he
added
,
as
if

himself
from
a
reproach
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
denying
that

brother

and
I
'm
noways
ungrateful

''
said
poor
*NL*
Mrs.
Moss
,
too
fagged
by
toil
and
children
to
have
strength
left
for
*NL*
any
pride
.
``
But
here
's
the

been

Moss

*NL*
*NL*
``
While

said
Mr.
Moss
,
feeling
out
of
breath
and
*NL*
injured
.
``
I
've
been
running
all
the
way

Wo
n't
you

light
,
Mr.

Tulliver

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

you
in
the
*NL*
garden
,
''
said
Mr.
Tulliver
,
thinking
that
he
should
be
more
likely
to
*NL*
show
a
due
spirit
of
resolve
if
his
sister
were
not
present
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
got
down
,
and
passed
with
Mr.
Moss
into
the
garden
,
toward
an
old
*NL*
yew-tree
arbor
,
while
his
sister
stood
tapping
her
baby
on
the
back
*NL*
and
looking
wistfully
after
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Their
entrance
into
the
yew-tree
arbor
surprised
several
fowls
that
*NL*
were
recreating
themselves
by
scratching
deep
holes
in
the
dusty
*NL*
ground
,
and
at
once
took
flight
with
much
pother
and
cackling
.
Mr.
*NL*
Tulliver
sat
down
on
the
bench
,
and
tapping
the
ground
curiously
here
*NL*
and
there
with
his
stick
,
as
if
he
suspected
some
hollowness
,
opened
*NL*
the
conversation
by
observing
,
with
something
like
a
snarl
in
his
*NL*
tone
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
you
've
got
wheat
again
in
that
Corner
Close
,
I
see
;
and
never
a
*NL*
bit
o

dressing
on
it
.
You
'll
do
no
good
with
it
this
year
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Moss
,
who
,
when
he
married
Miss
Tulliver
,
had
been
regarded
as
the
*NL*
buck
of
Basset
,
now
wore
a
beard
nearly
a
week
old
,
and
had
the
*NL*
depressed
,
unexpectant
air
of
a
machine-horse
.
He
answered
in
a
*NL*
patient-grumbling
tone
,
``
Why
,
poor
farmers
like
me
must
do
as
they
*NL*
can
;
they
must
leave
it
to
them
as
have
got
money
to
play
with
,
to
put
*NL*
half
as
much
into
the
ground
as
they
mean
to
get
out
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
who
should
have

if
it
is
n't
them

can
borrow
money
without
paying
interest
,
''
said
Mr.
Tulliver
,
who
*NL*
wished
to
get
into
a
slight
quarrel
;
it
was
the
most
natural
and
easy
*NL*
introduction
to
calling
in
money
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
I
'm
behind
with
the
interest
,
''
said
Mr.
Moss
,
``
but
I
was
so
*NL*
unlucky

*NL*
*NL*

Mr.

*NL*
*NL*
``

Tulliver

said
Mr.
Moss
,
deprecatingly
;
``
I
know
there
is
n't
a
*NL*
day-laborer

harder

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
use

''
said
Mr.
Tulliver
,
sharply
,
``
when

I

I

even
saying

You
must
look
about

see
how
you
can
pay

the
three
hundred
*NL*

.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
if
that
's
what
you
mean
,
''
said
Mr.
Moss
,
looking
blankly
before
*NL*
him
,
``
we
'd
better
be
sold
up

''
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
relations
are
undeniably
irritating
,
--
their
existence
is
so
*NL*
entirely
uncalled
for
on
our
part
,
and
they
are
almost
always
very
*NL*
faulty
people
.
Mr.
Tulliver
had
succeeded
in
getting
quite
as
much
*NL*
irritated
with
Mr.
Moss
as
he
had
desired
,
and
he
was
able
to
say
*NL*
angrily
,
rising
from
his
seat
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
must
do
as
you
can
.
_
I
_
ca
n't
find

must
look

my
own
family
.
I
*NL*
ca
n't
lie
out
o

my
money
any
longer
.
You
must
raise
it
as
quick
as
*NL*
you
can
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Tulliver
walked
abruptly
out
of
the
arbor
as
he
uttered
the
last
*NL*
sentence
,
and
,
without
looking
round
at
Mr.
Moss
,
went
on
to
the
*NL*
kitchen
door
,
where
the
eldest
boy
was
holding
his
horse
,
and
his
*NL*
sister
was
waiting
in
a
state
of
wondering
alarm
,
which
was
not
*NL*
without
its
alleviations
,
for
baby
was
making
pleasant
gurgling
*NL*
sounds
,
and
performing
a
great
deal
of
finger
practice
on
the
faded
*NL*
face
.
Mrs.
Moss
had
eight
children
,
but
could
never
overcome
her
*NL*
regret
that
the
twins
had
not
lived
.
Mr.
Moss
thought
their
removal
*NL*
was
not
without
its
consolations
.
``
Wo
n't
you
come
in
,
brother
?
''
she
*NL*
said
,
looking
anxiously
at
her
husband
,
who
was
walking
slowly
up
,
*NL*
while
Mr.
Tulliver
had
his
foot
already
in
the
stirrup
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
;
good-by
,
''
said
he
,
turning
his
horse
's
head
,
and
riding
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
man
could
feel
more
resolute
till
he
got
outside
the
yard
gate
,
and
*NL*
a
little
way
along
the
deep-rutted
lane
;
but
before
he
reached
the
*NL*
next
turning
,
which
would
take
him
out
of
sight
of
the
dilapidated
*NL*
farm-buildings
,
he
appeared
to
be
smitten
by
some
sudden
thought
.
He
*NL*
checked
his
horse
,
and
made
it
stand
still
in
the
same
spot
for
two
or
*NL*
three
minutes
,
during
which
he
turned
his
head
from
side
to
side
in
a
*NL*
melancholy
way
,
as
if
he
were
looking
at
some
painful
object
on
more
*NL*
sides
than
one
.
Evidently
,
after
his
fit
of
promptitude
,
Mr.
Tulliver
*NL*
was
relapsing
into
the
sense
that
this
is
a
puzzling
world
.
He
turned
*NL*
his
horse
,
and
rode
slowly
back
,
giving
vent
to
the
climax
of
feeling
*NL*
which
had
determined
this
movement
by
saying
aloud
,
as
he
struck
his
*NL*
horse
,
``
Poor
little
wench
!
she
'll
have
nobody
but
Tom
,
belike
,
when
*NL*
I
'm
gone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Tulliver
's
return
into
the
yard
was
descried
by
several
young
*NL*
Mosses
,
who
immediately
ran
in
with
the
exciting
news
to
their
mother
,
*NL*
so
that
Mrs.
Moss
was
again
on
the
door-step
when
her
brother
rode
up
.
*NL*
She
had
been
crying
,
but
was
rocking
baby
to
sleep
in
her
arms
now
,
*NL*
and
made
no
ostentatious
show
of
sorrow
as
her
brother
looked
at
her
,
*NL*
but
merely
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
father
's
gone
to
the
field
,
again
,
if
you
want
him
,
brother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Gritty
,
no
,
''
said
Mr.
Tulliver
,
in
a
gentle
tone
.
``
Do
n't
you
*NL*
fret
,
--
that
's
all
,
--
I
'll
make
a
shift
without
the
money
a
bit
,
only
*NL*
you
must
be
as
clever
and
contriving
as
you
can
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Moss
's
tears
came
again
at
this
unexpected
kindness
,
and
she
*NL*
could
say
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
come
!
--
the
little
wench
shall
come
and
see
you
.
I
'll
bring
her
*NL*
and
Tom
some
day
before
he
goes
to
school
.
You
must
n't
fret
.
I
'll
*NL*
allays
be
a
good
brother
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
for
that
word
,
brother
,
''
said
Mrs.
Moss
,
drying
her
tears
;
*NL*
then
turning
to
Lizzy
,
she
said
,
``
Run
now
,
and
fetch
the
colored
egg
*NL*
for
cousin
Maggie
.
''
Lizzy
ran
in
,
and
quickly
reappeared
with
a
small
*NL*
paper
parcel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
boiled
hard
,
brother
,
and
colored
with
thrums
,
very
pretty
;
it
*NL*
was
done
o
'
purpose
for
Maggie
.
Will
you
please
to
carry
it
in
your
*NL*
pocket
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
ay
,
''
said
Mr.
Tulliver
,
putting
it
carefully
in
his
side
pocket
.
*NL*
``
Good-by
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
the
respectable
miller
returned
along
the
Basset
lanes
rather
*NL*
more
puzzled
than
before
as
to
ways
and
means
,
but
still
with
the
*NL*
sense
of
a
danger
escaped
.
It
had
come
across
his
mind
that
if
he
were
*NL*
hard
upon
his
sister
,
it
might
somehow
tend
to
make
Tom
hard
upon
*NL*
Maggie
at
some
distant
day
,
when
her
father
was
no
longer
there
to
*NL*
take
her
part
;
for
simple
people
,
like
our
friend
Mr.
Tulliver
,
are
*NL*
apt
to
clothe
unimpeachable
feelings
in
erroneous
ideas
,
and
this
was
*NL*
his
confused
way
of
explaining
to
himself
that
his
love
and
anxiety
*NL*
for
``
the
little
wench
''
had
given
him
a
new
sensibility
toward
his
*NL*
sister
.

Chapter
IX
*NL*
*NL*
To
Garum
Firs
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
While
the
possible
troubles
of
Maggie
's
future
were
occupying
her
*NL*
father
's
mind
,
she
herself
was
tasting
only
the
bitterness
of
the
*NL*
present
.
Childhood
has
no
forebodings
;
but
then
,
it
is
soothed
by
no
*NL*
memories
of
outlived
sorrow
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
fact
was
,
the
day
had
begun
ill
with
Maggie
.
The
pleasure
of
*NL*
having
Lucy
to
look
at
,
and
the
prospect
of
the
afternoon
visit
to
*NL*
Garum
Firs
,
where
she
would
hear
uncle
Pullet
's
musical
box
,
had
been
*NL*
marred
as
early
as
eleven
o'clock
by
the
advent
of
the
hair-dresser
*NL*
from
St.
Ogg
's
,
who
had
spoken
in
the
severest
terms
of
the
condition
*NL*
in
which
he
had
found
her
hair
,
holding
up
one
jagged
lock
after
*NL*
another
and
saying
,
``
See
here
!
tut
,
tut
,
tut
!
''
in
a
tone
of
mingled
*NL*
disgust
and
pity
,
which
to
Maggie
's
imagination
was
equivalent
to
the
*NL*
strongest
expression
of
public
opinion
.
Mr.
Rappit
,
the
hair-dresser
,
*NL*
with
his
well-anointed
coronal
locks
tending
wavily
upward
,
like
the
*NL*
simulated
pyramid
of
flame
on
a
monumental
urn
,
seemed
to
her
at
that
*NL*
moment
the
most
formidable
of
her
contemporaries
,
into
whose
street
at
*NL*
St.
Ogg
's
she
would
carefully
refrain
from
entering
through
the
rest
*NL*
of
her
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
Moreover
,
the
preparation
for
a
visit
being
always
a
serious
affair
in
*NL*
the
Dodson
family
,
Martha
was
enjoined
to
have
Mrs.
Tulliver
's
room
*NL*
ready
an
hour
earlier
than
usual
,
that
the
laying
out
of
the
best
*NL*
clothes
might
not
be
deferred
till
the
last
moment
,
as
was
sometimes
*NL*
the
case
in
families
of
lax
views
,
where
the
ribbon-strings
were
never
*NL*
rolled
up
,
where
there
was
little
or
no
wrapping
in
silver
paper
,
and
*NL*
where
the
sense
that
the
Sunday
clothes
could
be
got
at
quite
easily
*NL*
produced
no
shock
to
the
mind
.
Already
,
at
twelve
o'clock
,
Mrs.
*NL*
Tulliver
had
on
her
visiting
costume
,
with
a
protective
apparatus
of
*NL*
brown
holland
,
as
if
she
had
been
a
piece
of
satin
furniture
in
danger
*NL*
of
flies
;
Maggie
was
frowning
and
twisting
her
shoulders
,
that
she
*NL*
might
if
possible
shrink
away
from
the
prickliest
of
tuckers
,
while
*NL*
her
mother
was
remonstrating
,
``
Do
n't
,
Maggie
,
my
dear
;
do
n't
make
*NL*
yourself
so
ugly
!
''
and
Tom
's
cheeks
were
looking
particularly
*NL*
brilliant
as
a
relief
to
his
best
blue
suit
,
which
he
wore
with
*NL*
becoming
calmness
,
having
,
after
a
little
wrangling
,
effected
what
was
*NL*
always
the
one
point
of
interest
to
him
in
his
toilet
:
he
had
*NL*
transferred
all
the
contents
of
his
every-day
pockets
to
those
*NL*
actually
in
wear
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
Lucy
,
she
was
just
as
pretty
and
neat
as
she
had
been
*NL*
yesterday
;
no
accidents
ever
happened
to
her
clothes
,
and
she
was
*NL*
never
uncomfortable
in
them
,
so
that
she
looked
with
wondering
pity
at
*NL*
Maggie
,
pouting
and
writhing
under
the
exasperating
tucker
.
Maggie
*NL*
would
certainly
have
torn
it
off
,
if
she
had
not
been
checked
by
the
*NL*
remembrance
of
her
recent
humiliation
about
her
hair
;
as
it
was
,
she
*NL*
confined
herself
to
fretting
and
twisting
,
and
behaving
peevishly
*NL*
about
the
card-houses
which
they
were
allowed
to
build
till
dinner
,
as
*NL*
a
suitable
amusement
for
boys
and
girls
in
their
best
clothes
.
Tom
*NL*
could
build
perfect
pyramids
of
houses
;
but
Maggie
's
would
never
bear
*NL*
the
laying
on
the
roof
.
It
was
always
so
with
the
things
that
Maggie
*NL*
made
;
and
Tom
had
deduced
the
conclusion
that
no
girls
could
ever
make
*NL*
anything
.
But
it
happened
that
Lucy
proved
wonderfully
clever
at
*NL*
building
;
she
handled
the
cards
so
lightly
,
and
moved
so
gently
,
that
*NL*
Tom
condescended
to
admire
her
houses
as
well
as
his
own
,
the
more
*NL*
readily
because
she
had
asked
him
to
teach
her
.
Maggie
,
too
,
would
*NL*
have
admired
Lucy
's
houses
,
and
would
have
given
up
her
own
*NL*
unsuccessful
building
to
contemplate
them
,
without
ill
temper
,
if
her
*NL*
tucker
had
not
made
her
peevish
,
and
if
Tom
had
not
inconsiderately
*NL*
laughed
when
her
houses
fell
,
and
told
her
she
was
``
a
stupid
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
laugh
at
me
,
Tom
!
''
she
burst
out
angrily
;
``
I
'm
not
a
stupid
.
I
*NL*
know
a
great
many
things
you
do
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
dare
say
,
Miss
Spitfire
!
I
'd
never
be
such
a
cross
thing
as
*NL*
you
,
making
faces
like
that
.
Lucy
does
n't
do
so
.
I
like
Lucy
better
*NL*
than
you
;
_
I
_
wish
Lucy
was
_
my
_
sister
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
it
's
very
wicked
and
cruel
of
you
to
wish
so
,
''
said
Maggie
,
*NL*
starting
up
hurriedly
from
her
place
on
the
floor
,
and
upsetting
Tom
's
*NL*
wonderful
pagoda
.
She
really
did
not
mean
it
,
but
the
circumstantial
*NL*
evidence
was
against
her
,
and
Tom
turned
white
with
anger
,
but
said
*NL*
nothing
;
he
would
have
struck
her
,
only
he
knew
it
was
cowardly
to
*NL*
strike
a
girl
,
and
Tom
Tulliver
was
quite
determined
he
would
never
do
*NL*
anything
cowardly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
stood
in
dismay
and
terror
,
while
Tom
got
up
from
the
floor
and
*NL*
walked
away
,
pale
,
from
the
scattered
ruins
of
his
pagoda
,
and
Lucy
*NL*
looked
on
mutely
,
like
a
kitten
pausing
from
its
lapping
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Tom
,
''
said
Maggie
,
at
last
,
going
half-way
toward
him
,
``
I
did
n't
*NL*
mean
to
knock
it
down
,
indeed
,
indeed
I
did
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
took
no
notice
of
her
,
but
took
,
instead
,
two
or
three
hard
peas
*NL*
out
of
his
pocket
,
and
shot
them
with
his
thumbnail
against
the
*NL*
window
,
vaguely
at
first
,
but
presently
with
the
distinct
aim
of
*NL*
hitting
a
superannuated
blue-bottle
which
was
exposing
its
imbecility
*NL*
in
the
spring
sunshine
,
clearly
against
the
views
of
Nature
,
who
had
*NL*
provided
Tom
and
the
peas
for
the
speedy
destruction
of
this
weak
*NL*
individual
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
the
morning
had
been
made
heavy
to
Maggie
,
and
Tom
's
persistent
*NL*
coldness
to
her
all
through
their
walk
spoiled
the
fresh
air
and
*NL*
sunshine
for
her
.
He
called
Lucy
to
look
at
the
half-built
bird
's
nest
*NL*
without
caring
to
show
it
Maggie
,
and
peeled
a
willow
switch
for
Lucy
*NL*
and
himself
,
without
offering
one
to
Maggie
.
Lucy
had
said
,
``
Maggie
,
*NL*
should
n't
_
you
_
like
one
?
''
but
Tom
was
deaf
.
*NL*
*NL*
Still
,
the
sight
of
the
peacock
opportunely
spreading
his
tail
on
the
*NL*
stackyard
wall
,
just
as
they
reached
Garum
Firs
,
was
enough
to
divert
*NL*
the
mind
temporarily
from
personal
grievances
.
And
this
was
only
the
*NL*
beginning
of
beautiful
sights
at
Garum
Firs
.
All
the
farmyard
life
was
*NL*
wonderful
there
,
--
bantams
,
speckled
and
top-knotted
;
Friesland
hens
,
*NL*
with
their
feathers
all
turned
the
wrong
way
;
Guinea-fowls
that
flew
*NL*
and
screamed
and
dropped
their
pretty
spotted
feathers
;
pouter-pigeons
*NL*
and
a
tame
magpie
;
nay
,
a
goat
,
and
a
wonderful
brindled
dog
,
half
*NL*
mastiff
,
half
bull-dog
,
as
large
as
a
lion
.
Then
there
were
white
*NL*
railings
and
white
gates
all
about
,
and
glittering
weathercocks
of
*NL*
various
design
,
and
garden-walks
paved
with
pebbles
in
beautiful
*NL*
patterns
,
--
nothing
was
quite
common
at
Garum
Firs
;
and
Tom
thought
*NL*
that
the
unusual
size
of
the
toads
there
was
simply
due
to
the
general
*NL*
unusualness
which
characterized
uncle
Pullet
's
possessions
as
a
*NL*
gentleman
farmer
.
Toads
who
paid
rent
were
naturally
leaner
.
As
for
*NL*
the
house
,
it
was
not
less
remarkable
;
it
had
a
receding
centre
,
and
*NL*
two
wings
with
battlemented
turrets
,
and
was
covered
with
glittering
*NL*
white
stucco
.
*NL*
*NL*
Uncle
Pullet
had
seen
the
expected
party
approaching
from
the
window
,
*NL*
and
made
haste
to
unbar
and
unchain
the
front
door
,
kept
always
in
*NL*
this
fortified
condition
from
fear
of
tramps
,
who
might
be
supposed
to
*NL*
know
of
the
glass
case
of
stuffed
birds
in
the
hall
,
and
to
*NL*
contemplate
rushing
in
and
carrying
it
away
on
their
heads
.
Aunt
*NL*
Pullet
,
too
,
appeared
at
the
doorway
,
and
as
soon
as
her
sister
was
*NL*
within
hearing
said
,
``
Stop
the
children
,
for
God
's
sake
!
Bessy
;
do
n't
*NL*
let
'em
come
up
the
door-steps
;
Sally
's
bringing
the
old
mat
and
the
*NL*
duster
,
to
rub
their
shoes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Pullet
's
front-door
mats
were
by
no
means
intended
to
wipe
shoes
*NL*
on
;
the
very
scraper
had
a
deputy
to
do
its
dirty
work
.
Tom
rebelled
*NL*
particularly
against
this
shoewiping
,
which
he
always
considered
in
*NL*
the
light
of
an
indignity
to
his
sex
.
He
felt
it
as
the
beginning
of
*NL*
the
disagreeables
incident
to
a
visit
at
aunt
Pullet
's
,
where
he
had
*NL*
once
been
compelled
to
sit
with
towels
wrapped
round
his
boots
;
a
fact
*NL*
which
may
serve
to
correct
the
too-hasty
conclusion
that
a
visit
to
*NL*
Garum
Firs
must
have
been
a
great
treat
to
a
young
gentleman
fond
of
*NL*
animals
,
--
fond
,
that
is
,
of
throwing
stones
at
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
disagreeable
was
confined
to
his
feminine
companions
;
it
was
*NL*
the
mounting
of
the
polished
oak
stairs
,
which
had
very
handsome
*NL*
carpets
rolled
up
and
laid
by
in
a
spare
bedroom
,
so
that
the
ascent
*NL*
of
these
glossy
steps
might
have
served
,
in
barbarous
times
,
as
a
*NL*
trial
by
ordeal
from
which
none
but
the
most
spotless
virtue
could
*NL*
have
come
off
with
unbroken
limbs
.
Sophy
's
weakness
about
these
*NL*
polished
stairs
was
always
a
subject
of
bitter
remonstrance
on
Mrs.
*NL*
Glegg
's
part
;
but
Mrs.
Tulliver
ventured
on
no
comment
,
only
thinking
*NL*
to
herself
it
was
a
mercy
when
she
and
the
children
were
safe
on
the
*NL*
landing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mrs.
Gray
has
sent
home
my
new
bonnet
,
Bessy
,
''
said
Mrs.
Pullet
,
in
a
*NL*
pathetic
tone
,
as
Mrs.
Tulliver
adjusted
her
cap
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
she
,
sister
?
''
said
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
with
an
air
of
much
interest
.
*NL*
``
And
how
do
you
like
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
apt
to
make
a
mess
with
clothes
,
taking
'em
out
and
putting
'em
*NL*
in
again
,
''
said
Mrs.
Pullet
,
drawing
a
bunch
of
keys
from
her
pocket
*NL*
and
looking
at
them
earnestly
,
``
but
it
`
ud
be
a
pity
for
you
to
go
*NL*
away
without
seeing
it
.
There
's
no
knowing
what
may
happen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Pullet
shook
her
head
slowly
at
this
last
serious
consideration
,
*NL*
which
determined
her
to
single
out
a
particular
key
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
afraid
it
'll
be
troublesome
to
you
getting
it
out
,
sister
,
''
said
*NL*
Mrs.
Tulliver
;
``
but
I
_
should
_
like
to
see
what
sort
of
a
crown
she
's
*NL*
made
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Pullet
rose
with
a
melancholy
air
and
unlocked
one
wing
of
a
very
*NL*
bright
wardrobe
,
where
you
may
have
hastily
supposed
she
would
find
a
*NL*
new
bonnet
.
Not
at
all
.
Such
a
supposition
could
only
have
arisen
from
*NL*
a
too-superficial
acquaintance
with
the
habits
of
the
Dodson
family
.
*NL*
In
this
wardrobe
Mrs.
Pullet
was
seeking
something
small
enough
to
be
*NL*
hidden
among
layers
of
linen
,
--
it
was
a
door-key
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
come
with
me
into
the
best
room
,
''
said
Mrs.
Pullet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
the
children
come
too
,
sister
?
''
inquired
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
who
saw
*NL*
that
Maggie
and
Lucy
were
looking
rather
eager
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
aunt
Pullet
,
reflectively
,
``
it
'll
perhaps
be
safer
for
*NL*
'em
to
come
;
they
'll
be
touching
something
if
we
leave
'em
behind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
they
went
in
procession
along
the
bright
and
slippery
corridor
,
*NL*
dimly
lighted
by
the
semi-lunar
top
of
the
window
which
rose
above
the
*NL*
closed
shutter
;
it
was
really
quite
solemn
.
Aunt
Pullet
paused
and
*NL*
unlocked
a
door
which
opened
on
something
still
more
solemn
than
the
*NL*
passage
,
--
a
darkened
room
,
in
which
the
outer
light
,
entering
feebly
,
*NL*
showed
what
looked
like
the
corpses
of
furniture
in
white
shrouds
.
*NL*
Everything
that
was
not
shrouded
stood
with
its
legs
upward
.
Lucy
laid
*NL*
hold
of
Maggie
's
frock
,
and
Maggie
's
heart
beat
rapidly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Aunt
Pullet
half-opened
the
shutter
and
then
unlocked
the
wardrobe
,
*NL*
with
a
melancholy
deliberateness
which
was
quite
in
keeping
with
the
*NL*
funereal
solemnity
of
the
scene
.
The
delicious
scent
of
rose-leaves
*NL*
that
issued
from
the
wardrobe
made
the
process
of
taking
out
sheet
*NL*
after
sheet
of
silver
paper
quite
pleasant
to
assist
at
,
though
the
*NL*
sight
of
the
bonnet
at
last
was
an
anticlimax
to
Maggie
,
who
would
*NL*
have
preferred
something
more
strikingly
preternatural
.
But
few
things
*NL*
could
have
been
more
impressive
to
Mrs.
Tulliver
.
She
looked
all
round
*NL*
it
in
silence
for
some
moments
,
and
then
said
emphatically
,
``
Well
,
*NL*
sister
,
I
'll
never
speak
against
the
full
crowns
again
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
great
concession
,
and
Mrs.
Pullet
felt
it
;
she
felt
something
*NL*
was
due
to
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'd
like
to
see
it
on
,
sister
?
''
she
said
sadly
.
``
I
'll
open
the
*NL*
shutter
a
bit
further
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
if
you
do
n't
mind
taking
off
your
cap
,
sister
,
''
said
Mrs.
*NL*
Tulliver
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Pullet
took
off
her
cap
,
displaying
the
brown
silk
scalp
with
a
*NL*
jutting
promontory
of
curls
which
was
common
to
the
more
mature
and
*NL*
judicious
women
of
those
times
,
and
placing
the
bonnet
on
her
head
,
*NL*
turned
slowly
round
,
like
a
draper
's
lay-figure
,
that
Mrs.
Tulliver
*NL*
might
miss
no
point
of
view
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
sometimes
thought
there
's
a
loop
too
much
o
'
ribbon
on
this
left
*NL*
side
,
sister
;
what
do
you
think
?
''
said
Mrs.
Pullet
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Tulliver
looked
earnestly
at
the
point
indicated
,
and
turned
her
*NL*
head
on
one
side
.
``
Well
,
I
think
it
's
best
as
it
is
;
if
you
meddled
*NL*
with
it
,
sister
,
you
might
repent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
true
,
''
said
aunt
Pullet
,
taking
off
the
bonnet
and
looking
at
*NL*
it
contemplatively
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
much
might
she
charge
you
for
that
bonnet
,
sister
?
''
said
Mrs.
*NL*
Tulliver
,
whose
mind
was
actively
engaged
on
the
possibility
of
*NL*
getting
a
humble
imitation
of
this
_
chef-d'oeuvre
_
made
from
a
piece
*NL*
of
silk
she
had
at
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Pullet
screwed
up
her
mouth
and
shook
her
head
,
and
then
*NL*
whispered
,
``
Pullet
pays
for
it
;
he
said
I
was
to
have
the
best
bonnet
*NL*
at
Garum
Church
,
let
the
next
best
be
whose
it
would
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
began
slowly
to
adjust
the
trimmings
,
in
preparation
for
returning
*NL*
it
to
its
place
in
the
wardrobe
,
and
her
thoughts
seemed
to
have
taken
*NL*
a
melancholy
turn
,
for
she
shook
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
she
said
at
last
,
``
I
may
never
wear
it
twice
,
sister
;
who
*NL*
knows
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
talk
o
'
that
sister
,
''
answered
Mrs.
Tulliver
.
``
I
hope
you
'll
*NL*
have
your
health
this
summer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
but
there
may
come
a
death
in
the
family
,
as
there
did
soon
after
*NL*
I
had
my
green
satin
bonnet
.
Cousin
Abbott
may
go
,
and
we
ca
n't
think
*NL*
o
'
wearing
crape
less
nor
half
a
year
for
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
_
would
_
be
unlucky
,
''
said
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
entering
thoroughly
*NL*
into
the
possibility
of
an
inopportune
decease
.
``
There
's
never
so
much
*NL*
pleasure
i
'
wearing
a
bonnet
the
second
year
,
especially
when
the
*NL*
crowns
are
so
chancy
,
--
never
two
summers
alike
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
it
's
the
way
i
'
this
world
,
''
said
Mrs.
Pullet
,
returning
the
*NL*
bonnet
to
the
wardrobe
and
locking
it
up
.
She
maintained
a
silence
*NL*
characterized
by
head-shaking
,
until
they
had
all
issued
from
the
*NL*
solemn
chamber
and
were
in
her
own
room
again
.
Then
,
beginning
to
cry
,
*NL*
she
said
,
``
Sister
,
if
you
should
never
see
that
bonnet
again
till
I
'm
*NL*
dead
and
gone
,
you
'll
remember
I
showed
it
you
this
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Tulliver
felt
that
she
ought
to
be
affected
,
but
she
was
a
woman
*NL*
of
sparse
tears
,
stout
and
healthy
;
she
could
n't
cry
so
much
as
her
*NL*
sister
Pullet
did
,
and
had
often
felt
her
deficiency
at
funerals
.
Her
*NL*
effort
to
bring
tears
into
her
eyes
issued
in
an
odd
contraction
of
*NL*
her
face
.
Maggie
,
looking
on
attentively
,
felt
that
there
was
some
*NL*
painful
mystery
about
her
aunt
's
bonnet
which
she
was
considered
too
*NL*
young
to
understand
;
indignantly
conscious
,
all
the
while
,
that
she
*NL*
could
have
understood
that
,
as
well
as
everything
else
,
if
she
had
*NL*
been
taken
into
confidence
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
went
down
,
uncle
Pullet
observed
,
with
some
acumen
,
that
he
*NL*
reckoned
the
missis
had
been
showing
her
bonnet
,
--
that
was
what
had
*NL*
made
them
so
long
upstairs
.
With
Tom
the
interval
had
seemed
still
*NL*
longer
,
for
he
had
been
seated
in
irksome
constraint
on
the
edge
of
a
*NL*
sofa
directly
opposite
his
uncle
Pullet
,
who
regarded
him
with
*NL*
twinkling
gray
eyes
,
and
occasionally
addressed
him
as
``
Young
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
young
sir
,
what
do
you
learn
at
school
?
''
was
a
standing
*NL*
question
with
uncle
Pullet
;
whereupon
Tom
always
looked
sheepish
,
*NL*
rubbed
his
hands
across
his
face
,
and
answered
,
``
I
do
n't
know
.
''
It
was
*NL*
altogether
so
embarrassing
to
be
seated
_
tete-a-tete
_
with
uncle
*NL*
Pullet
,
that
Tom
could
not
even
look
at
the
prints
on
the
walls
,
or
*NL*
the
flycages
,
or
the
wonderful
flower-pots
;
he
saw
nothing
but
his
*NL*
uncle
's
gaiters
.
Not
that
Tom
was
in
awe
of
his
uncle
's
mental
*NL*
superiority
;
indeed
,
he
had
made
up
his
mind
that
he
did
n't
want
to
be
*NL*
a
gentleman
farmer
,
because
he
should
n't
like
to
be
such
a
*NL*
thin-legged
,
silly
fellow
as
his
uncle
Pullet
,
--
a
molly-coddle
,
in
*NL*
fact
.
A
boy
's
sheepishness
is
by
no
means
a
sign
of
overmastering
*NL*
reverence
;
and
while
you
are
making
encouraging
advances
to
him
under
*NL*
the
idea
that
he
is
overwhelmed
by
a
sense
of
your
age
and
wisdom
,
ten
*NL*
to
one
he
is
thinking
you
extremely
queer
.
The
only
consolation
I
can
*NL*
suggest
to
you
is
,
that
the
Greek
boys
probably
thought
the
same
of
*NL*
Aristotle
.
It
is
only
when
you
have
mastered
a
restive
horse
,
or
*NL*
thrashed
a
drayman
,
or
have
got
a
gun
in
your
hand
,
that
these
shy
*NL*
juniors
feel
you
to
be
a
truly
admirable
and
enviable
character
.
At
*NL*
least
,
I
am
quite
sure
of
Tom
Tulliver
's
sentiments
on
these
points
.
*NL*
In
very
tender
years
,
when
he
still
wore
a
lace
border
under
his
*NL*
outdoor
cap
,
he
was
often
observed
peeping
through
the
bars
of
a
gate
*NL*
and
making
minatory
gestures
with
his
small
forefinger
while
he
*NL*
scolded
the
sheep
with
an
inarticulate
burr
,
intended
to
strike
terror
*NL*
into
their
astonished
minds
;
indicating
thus
early
that
desire
for
*NL*
mastery
over
the
inferior
animals
,
wild
and
domestic
,
including
*NL*
cockchafers
,
neighbors
'
dogs
,
and
small
sisters
,
which
in
all
ages
has
*NL*
been
an
attribute
of
so
much
promise
for
the
fortunes
of
our
race
.
*NL*
Now
,
Mr.
Pullet
never
rode
anything
taller
than
a
low
pony
,
and
was
*NL*
the
least
predatory
of
men
,
considering
firearms
dangerous
,
as
apt
to
*NL*
go
off
of
themselves
by
nobody
's
particular
desire
.
So
that
Tom
was
*NL*
not
without
strong
reasons
when
,
in
confidential
talk
with
a
chum
,
he
*NL*
had
described
uncle
Pullet
as
a
nincompoop
,
taking
care
at
the
same
*NL*
time
to
observe
that
he
was
a
very
``
rich
fellow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
only
alleviating
circumstance
in
a
_
tete-a-tete
_
with
uncle
Pullet
*NL*
was
that
he
kept
a
variety
of
lozenges
and
peppermint-drops
about
his
*NL*
person
,
and
when
at
a
loss
for
conversation
,
he
filled
up
the
void
by
*NL*
proposing
a
mutual
solace
of
this
kind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
like
peppermints
,
young
sir
?
''
required
only
a
tacit
answer
*NL*
when
it
was
accompanied
by
a
presentation
of
the
article
in
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
appearance
of
the
little
girls
suggested
to
uncle
Pullet
the
*NL*
further
solace
of
small
sweet-cakes
,
of
which
he
also
kept
a
stock
*NL*
under
lock
and
key
for
his
own
private
eating
on
wet
days
;
but
the
*NL*
three
children
had
no
sooner
got
the
tempting
delicacy
between
their
*NL*
fingers
,
than
aunt
Pullet
desired
them
to
abstain
from
eating
it
till
*NL*
the
tray
and
the
plates
came
,
since
with
those
crisp
cakes
they
would
*NL*
make
the
floor
``
all
over
''
crumbs
.
Lucy
did
n't
mind
that
much
,
for
the
*NL*
cake
was
so
pretty
,
she
thought
it
was
rather
a
pity
to
eat
it
;
but
*NL*
Tom
,
watching
his
opportunity
while
the
elders
were
talking
,
hastily
*NL*
stowed
it
in
his
mouth
at
two
bites
,
and
chewed
it
furtively
.
As
for
*NL*
Maggie
,
becoming
fascinated
,
as
usual
,
by
a
print
of
Ulysses
and
*NL*
Nausicaa
,
which
uncle
Pullet
had
bought
as
a
``
pretty
Scripture
thing
,
''
*NL*
she
presently
let
fall
her
cake
,
and
in
an
unlucky
movement
crushed
it
*NL*
beneath
her
foot
,
--
a
source
of
so
much
agitation
to
aunt
Pullet
and
*NL*
conscious
disgrace
to
Maggie
,
that
she
began
to
despair
of
hearing
the
*NL*
musical
snuff-box
to-day
,
till
,
after
some
reflection
,
it
occurred
to
*NL*
her
that
Lucy
was
in
high
favor
enough
to
venture
on
asking
for
a
*NL*
tune
.
So
she
whispered
to
Lucy
;
and
Lucy
,
who
always
did
what
she
was
*NL*
desired
to
do
,
went
up
quietly
to
her
uncle
's
knee
,
and
blush-all
over
*NL*
her
neck
while
she
fingered
her
necklace
,
said
,
``
Will
you
please
play
*NL*
us
a
tune
,
uncle
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
thought
it
was
by
reason
of
some
exceptional
talent
in
uncle
*NL*
Pullet
that
the
snuff-box
played
such
beautiful
tunes
,
and
indeed
the
*NL*
thing
was
viewed
in
that
light
by
the
majority
of
his
neighbors
in
*NL*
Garum
.
Mr.
Pullet
had
_
bought
_
the
box
,
to
begin
with
,
and
he
*NL*
understood
winding
it
up
,
and
knew
which
tune
it
was
going
to
play
*NL*
beforehand
;
altogether
the
possession
of
this
unique
``
piece
of
music
''
*NL*
was
a
proof
that
Mr.
Pullet
's
character
was
not
of
that
entire
nullity
*NL*
which
might
otherwise
have
been
attributed
to
it
.
But
uncle
Pullet
,
*NL*
when
entreated
to
exhibit
his
accomplishment
,
never
depreciated
it
by
*NL*
a
too-ready
consent
.
``
We
'll
see
about
it
,
''
was
the
answer
he
always
*NL*
gave
,
carefully
abstaining
from
any
sign
of
compliance
till
a
suitable
*NL*
number
of
minutes
had
passed
.
Uncle
Pullet
had
a
programme
for
all
*NL*
great
social
occasions
,
and
in
this
way
fenced
himself
in
from
much
*NL*
painful
confusion
and
perplexing
freedom
of
will
.
*NL*
*NL*
Perhaps
the
suspense
did
heighten
Maggie
's
enjoyment
when
the
fairy
*NL*
tune
began
;
for
the
first
time
she
quite
forgot
that
she
had
a
load
on
*NL*
her
mind
,
that
Tom
was
angry
with
her
;
and
by
the
time
``
Hush
,
ye
*NL*
pretty
warbling
choir
,
''
had
been
played
,
her
face
wore
that
bright
*NL*
look
of
happiness
,
while
she
sat
immovable
with
her
hands
clasped
,
*NL*
which
sometimes
comforted
her
mother
with
the
sense
that
Maggie
could
*NL*
look
pretty
now
and
then
,
in
spite
of
her
brown
skin
.
But
when
the
*NL*
magic
music
ceased
,
she
jumped
up
,
and
running
toward
Tom
,
put
her
arm
*NL*
round
his
neck
and
said
,
``
Oh
,
Tom
,
is
n't
it
pretty
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lest
you
should
think
it
showed
a
revolting
insensibility
in
Tom
that
*NL*
he
felt
any
new
anger
toward
Maggie
for
this
uncalled-for
and
,
to
him
,
*NL*
inexplicable
caress
,
I
must
tell
you
that
he
had
his
glass
of
cowslip
*NL*
wine
in
his
hand
,
and
that
she
jerked
him
so
as
to
make
him
spill
half
*NL*
of
it
.
He
must
have
been
an
extreme
milksop
not
to
say
angrily
,
``
Look
*NL*
there
,
now
!
''
especially
when
his
resentment
was
sanctioned
,
as
it
was
,
*NL*
by
general
disapprobation
of
Maggie
's
behavior
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
n't
you
sit
still
,
Maggie
?
''
her
mother
said
peevishly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Little
gells
must
n't
come
to
see
me
if
they
behave
in
that
way
,
''
said
*NL*
aunt
Pullet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
you
're
too
rough
,
little
miss
,
''
said
uncle
Pullet
.
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Maggie
sat
down
again
,
with
the
music
all
chased
out
of
her
soul
,
*NL*
and
the
seven
small
demons
all
in
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
foreseeing
nothing
but
misbehavior
while
the
children
*NL*
remained
indoors
,
took
an
early
opportunity
of
suggesting
that
,
now
*NL*
they
were
rested
after
their
walk
,
they
might
go
and
play
out
of
*NL*
doors
;
and
aunt
Pullet
gave
permission
,
only
enjoining
them
not
to
go
*NL*
off
the
paved
walks
in
the
garden
,
and
if
they
wanted
to
see
the
*NL*
poultry
fed
,
to
view
them
from
a
distance
on
the
horse-block
;
a
*NL*
restriction
which
had
been
imposed
ever
since
Tom
had
been
found
*NL*
guilty
of
running
after
the
peacock
,
with
an
illusory
idea
that
fright
*NL*
would
make
one
of
its
feathers
drop
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Tulliver
's
thoughts
had
been
temporarily
diverted
from
the
*NL*
quarrel
with
Mrs.
Glegg
by
millinery
and
maternal
cares
,
but
now
the
*NL*
great
theme
of
the
bonnet
was
thrown
into
perspective
,
and
the
*NL*
children
were
out
of
the
way
,
yesterday
's
anxieties
recurred
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
weighs
on
my
mind
so
as
never
was
,
''
she
said
,
by
way
of
opening
*NL*
the
subject
,
``
sister
Glegg
's
leaving
the
house
in
that
way
.
I
'm
sure
*NL*
I
'd
no
wish
t
'
offend
a
sister
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
said
aunt
Pullet
,
``
there
's
no
accounting
for
what
Jane
`
ull
do

*NL*
I
would
n't
speak
of
it
out
o
'
the
family
,
if
it
was
n't
to
Dr.
*NL*
Turnbull
;
but
it
's
my
belief
Jane
lives
too
low

I
've
said
so
to

Pullet
often
and
often
,
and
he
knows
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

Monday

a
week

we
came
away
from

drinking
tea

said
Mr.
Pullet
,
beginning
to
nurse
his
knee
*NL*
and
shelter
it
with
his
pocket-hand-kerchief
,
as
was
his
way
when
the
*NL*
conversation
took
an
interesting
turn
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
like
I
did

Mrs.
Pullet

she
continued
,
looking
pathetically
at
her

sister

``
I

be
poorly
off

*NL*
``

every

eleven
and
four
,
and
the
`
fervescing
mixture

''
*NL*
rehearsed
Mr.
Pullet
,
with
a
punctuation
determined
by
a
lozenge
on
*NL*
his
tongue
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

perhaps
it

anything

said
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
who
naturally
saw
*NL*
the
wide
subject
of
medicine
chiefly
in
relation
to
Mrs.
Glegg
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It

raising

fall
again

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

said
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
*NL*
wiping
away
one
small
tear
from
the
corner
of
her
eye
;
``
but
I
'm
sure
*NL*
he
's
never
been
the

Mrs.

,
*NL*
compassionately
,
``
for
I
doubt
you
'll
have
trouble
enough

got
that

her
children
hanging
on

him

*NL*
This
view
of
her
position
was
naturally
far
from
cheering
to
Mrs.
*NL*
Tulliver
.
Her
imagination
was
not
easily
acted
on
,
but
she
could
not
*NL*
help
thinking
that
her
case
was
a
hard
one
,
since
it
appeared
that
*NL*
other
people
thought
it
hard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sure
,
sister
,
I
ca
n't
help
myself
,
''
she
said
,
urged
by
the
fear
*NL*
lest
her
anticipated
misfortunes
might
be
held
retributive
,
to
take
*NL*
comprehensive
review
of
her
past
conduct
.
``
There
's
no
woman
strives
*NL*
more
for
her
children
;
and
I
'm
sure
at
scouring-time
this
Lady-day
as
*NL*
I
've
had
all
the
bedhangings
taken
down
I
did
as
much
as
the
two
gells
*NL*
put
together
;
and
there
's
the
last
elder-flower
wine
I
've
*NL*
made

beautiful
!
I
allays
offer
it
along
with
the
sherry
,
though
*NL*
sister
Glegg
will
have
it
I
'm
so
extravagant
;
and
as
for
liking
to
*NL*
have
my
clothes
tidy
,
and
not
go
a
fright
about
the
house
,
there
's
*NL*
nobody
in
the
parish
can
say
anything
against
me
in
respect
o

*NL*
backbiting
and
making
mischief
,
for
I
do
n't
wish
anybody
any
harm

*NL*
nobody
loses
by
sending
me
a
porkpie

for
my
pies
are
fit
to
show
with
*NL*
the
best

my
neighbors

the
linen
's
so
in
order
as
if
I
was
to

I
should

be

*NL*
``

said
Mrs.
Pullet
,
holding
*NL*
her
head
on
one
side
,

fixing
her
eyes
pathetically
on
her
sister

*NL*
``

away

it

there

the

Mrs.

her
head
slowly

*NL*

what
can
I
do

Mrs.

I
'm
sure
I
do

to
know
anything
about
putting
out
money

all
that

I
could
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
're
like
me
in
that
,
Bessy

''
said
Mrs.
Pullet
;
``
and
I
think
*NL*
it

be
a

more
becoming

pier-glass

that

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

Mrs.

say
he
was
sorry
for
speaking
so
rash

If

said
Mrs.

whose
*NL*
partiality
did
not
blind
her
to
principles

she
did
not
forget
what
*NL*
was
due
to
people
of
independent
fortune
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
no
use
talking

that

said
poor
Mrs.

,
almost
*NL*
peevishly
.
``
If

down

*NL*
``

Mrs.

.
``
Her

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

Mrs.

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
you
perceive
,
was
not
aware
of
her
husband
's
*NL*
irrevocable
determination
to
pay
in
the
five
hundred
pounds
;
at
least
*NL*
such
a
determination
exceeded
her
powers
of
belief

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

Bessy

said
Mrs.

mournfully
,

do

in

I
shall
tell

I
do

driving
to

tomorrow

What
do

*NL*
Mr.

?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I

no
objections

''
said
Mr.
Pullet
,
who
was
perfectly
contented
*NL*
with
any
course
the
quarrel
might
take
,
so
that
Mr.
Tulliver
did
not
*NL*
apply
to
_
him
_
for
money
.
Mr.
Pullet
was
nervous
about
his
*NL*
investments
,
and
did
not
see
how
a
man
could
have
any
security
for
his
*NL*
money
unless
he
turned
it
into
land
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
little
further
discussion
as
to
whether
it
would
not
be
better
*NL*
for
Mrs.
Tulliver
to
accompany
them
on
a
visit
to
sister
Glegg
,
Mrs.
*NL*
Pullet
,
observing
that
it
was
tea-time
,
turned
to
reach
from
a
drawer
*NL*
a
delicate
damask
napkin
,
which
she
pinned
before
her
in
the
fashion
*NL*
of
an
apron
.
The
door
did
,
in
fact
,
soon
open
,
but
instead
of
the
*NL*
tea-tray
,
Sally
introduced
an
object
so
startling
that
both
Mrs.
*NL*
Pullet
and
Mrs.
Tulliver
gave
a
scream
,
causing
uncle
Pullet
to
*NL*
swallow
his
lozenge
--
for
the
fifth
time
in
his
life
,
as
he
afterward
*NL*
noted
.

Chapter

*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
Behaves
Worse
Than
She
Expected
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
startling
object
which
thus
made
an
epoch
for
uncle
Pullet
was
no
*NL*
other
than
little
Lucy
,
with
one
side
of
her
person
,
from
her
small
*NL*
foot
to
her
bonnet-crown
,
wet
and
discolored
with
mud
,
holding
out
two
*NL*
tiny
blackened
hands
,
and
making
a
very
piteous
face
.
To
account
for
*NL*
this
unprecedented
apparition
in
aunt
Pullet
's
parlor
,
we
must
return
*NL*
to
the
moment
when
the
three
children
went
to
play
out
of
doors
,
and
*NL*
the
small
demons
who
had
taken
possession
of
Maggie
's
soul
at
an
early
*NL*
period
of
the
day
had
returned
in
all
the
greater
force
after
a
*NL*
temporary
absence
.
All
the
disagreeable
recollections
of
the
morning
*NL*
were
thick
upon
her
,
when
Tom
,
whose
displeasure
toward
her
had
been
*NL*
considerably
refreshed
by
her
foolish
trick
of
causing
him
to
upset
*NL*
his
cowslip
wine
,
said
,
``
Here
,
Lucy
,
you
come
along
with
me
,
''
and
*NL*
walked
off
to
the
area
where
the
toads
were
,
as
if
there
were
no
*NL*
Maggie
in
existence
.
Seeing
this
,
Maggie
lingered
at
a
distance
*NL*
looking
like
a
small
Medusa
with
her
snakes
cropped
.
Lucy
was
*NL*
naturally
pleased
that
cousin
Tom
was
so
good
to
her
,
and
it
was
very
*NL*
amusing
to
see
him
tickling
a
fat
toad
with
a
piece
of
string
when
the
*NL*
toad
was
safe
down
the
area
,
with
an
iron
grating
over
him
.
Still
Lucy
*NL*
wished
Maggie
to
enjoy
the
spectacle
also
,
especially
as
she
would
*NL*
doubtless
find
a
name
for
the
toad
,
and
say
what
had
been
his
past
*NL*
history
;
for
Lucy
had
a
delighted
semibelief
in
Maggie
's
stories
about
*NL*
the
live
things
they
came
upon
by
accident
,
--
how
Mrs.
Earwig
had
a
*NL*
wash
at
home
,
and
one
of
her
children
had
fallen
into
the
hot
copper
,
*NL*
for
which
reason
she
was
running
so
fast
to
fetch
the
doctor
.
Tom
had
*NL*
a
profound
contempt
for
this
nonsense
of
Maggie
's
,
smashing
the
earwig
*NL*
at
once
as
a
superfluous
yet
easy
means
of
proving
the
entire
*NL*
unreality
of
such
a
story
;
but
Lucy
,
for
the
life
of
her
,
could
not
*NL*
help
fancying
there
was
something
in
it
,
and
at
all
events
thought
it
*NL*
was
very
pretty
make-believe
.
So
now
the
desire
to
know
the
history
of
*NL*
a
very
portly
toad
,
added
to
her
habitual
affectionateness
,
made
her
*NL*
run
back
to
Maggie
and
say
,
``
Oh
,
there
is
such
a
big
,
funny
toad
,
*NL*
Maggie
!
Do
come
and
see
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
said
nothing
,
but
turned
away
from
her
with
a
deeper
frown
.
As
*NL*
long
as
Tom
seemed
to
prefer
Lucy
to
her
,
Lucy
made
part
of
his
*NL*
unkindness
.
Maggie
would
have
thought
a
little
while
ago
that
she
*NL*
could
never
be
cross
with
pretty
little
Lucy
,
any
more
than
she
could
*NL*
be
cruel
to
a
little
white
mouse
;
but
then
,
Tom
had
always
been
quite
*NL*
indifferent
to
Lucy
before
,
and
it
had
been
left
to
Maggie
to
pet
and
*NL*
make
much
of
her
.
As
it
was
,
she
was
actually
beginning
to
think
that
*NL*
she
should
like
to
make
Lucy
cry
by
slapping
or
pinching
her
,
*NL*
especially
as
it
might
vex
Tom
,
whom
it
was
of
no
use
to
slap
,
even
if
*NL*
she
dared
,
because
he
did
n't
mind
it
.
And
if
Lucy
had
n't
been
there
,
*NL*
Maggie
was
sure
he
would
have
got
friends
with
her
sooner
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tickling
a
fat
toad
who
is
not
highly
sensitive
is
an
amusement
that
*NL*
it
is
possible
to
exhaust
,
and
Tom
by
and
by
began
to
look
round
for
*NL*
some
other
mode
of
passing
the
time
.
But
in
so
prim
a
garden
,
where
*NL*
they
were
not
to
go
off
the
paved
walks
,
there
was
not
a
great
choice
*NL*
of
sport
.
The
only
great
pleasure
such
a
restriction
suggested
was
the
*NL*
pleasure
of
breaking
it
,
and
Tom
began
to
meditate
an
insurrectionary
*NL*
visit
to
the
pond
,
about
a
field
's
length
beyond
the
garden
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
,
Lucy
,
''
he
began
,
nodding
his
head
up
and
down
with
great
*NL*
significance
,
as
he
coiled
up
his
string
again
,
``
what
do
you
think
I
*NL*
mean
to
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
Tom
?
''
said
Lucy
,
with
curiosity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
mean
to
go
to
the
pond
and
look
at
the
pike
.
You
may
go
with
me
if
*NL*
you
like
,
''
said
the
young
sultan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Tom
,
_
dare
_
you
?
''
said
Lucy
.
``
Aunt
said
we
must
n't
go
out
of
the
*NL*
garden
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
shall
go
out
at
the
other
end
of
the
garden
,
''
said
Tom
.
``
Nobody
*NL*
`
ull
see
us
.
Besides
,
I
do
n't
care
if
they
do
,
--
I
'll
run
off
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
_
I
_
could
n't
run
,
''
said
Lucy
,
who
had
never
before
been
exposed
*NL*
to
such
severe
temptation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
never
mind
;
they
wo
n't
be
cross
with
_
you
_
,
''
said
Tom
.
``
You
say
I
*NL*
took
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
walked
along
,
and
Lucy
trotted
by
his
side
,
timidly
enjoying
the
*NL*
rare
treat
of
doing
something
naughty
,
--
excited
also
by
the
mention
of
*NL*
that
celebrity
,
the
pike
,
about
which
she
was
quite
uncertain
whether
*NL*
it
was
a
fish
or
a
fowl
.
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
saw
them
leaving
the
garden
,
and
could
not
resist
the
impulse
*NL*
to
follow
.
Anger
and
jealousy
can
no
more
bear
to
lose
sight
of
their
*NL*
objects
than
love
,
and
that
Tom
and
Lucy
should
do
or
see
anything
of
*NL*
which
she
was
ignorant
would
have
been
an
intolerable
idea
to
Maggie
.
*NL*
So
she
kept
a
few
yards
behind
them
,
unobserved
by
Tom
,
who
was
*NL*
presently
absorbed
in
watching
for
the
pike
,
--
a
highly
interesting
*NL*
monster
;
he
was
said
to
be
so
very
old
,
so
very
large
,
and
to
have
*NL*
such
a
remarkable
appetite
.
The
pike
,
like
other
celebrities
,
did
not
*NL*
show
when
he
was
watched
for
,
but
Tom
caught
sight
of
something
in
*NL*
rapid
movement
in
the
water
,
which
attracted
him
to
another
spot
on
*NL*
the
brink
of
the
pond
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
,
Lucy
!
''
he
said
in
a
loud
whisper
,
``
come
here
!
take
care
!
keep
*NL*
on
the
grass
!
--
do
n't
step
where
the
cows
have
been
!
''
he
added
,
*NL*
pointing
to
a
peninsula
of
dry
grass
,
with
trodden
mud
on
each
side
of
*NL*
it
;
for
Tom
's
contemptuous
conception
of
a
girl
included
the
attribute
*NL*
of
being
unfit
to
walk
in
dirty
places
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
came
carefully
as
she
was
bidden
,
and
bent
down
to
look
at
what
*NL*
seemed
a
golden
arrow-head
darting
through
the
water
.
It
was
a
*NL*
water-snake
,
Tom
told
her
;
and
Lucy
at
last
could
see
the
serpentine
*NL*
wave
of
its
body
,
very
much
wondering
that
a
snake
could
swim
.
Maggie
*NL*
had
drawn
nearer
and
nearer
;
she
_
must
_
see
it
too
,
though
it
was
*NL*
bitter
to
her
,
like
everything
else
,
since
Tom
did
not
care
about
her
*NL*
seeing
it
.
At
last
she
was
close
by
Lucy
;
and
Tom
,
who
had
been
aware
*NL*
of
her
approach
,
but
would
not
notice
it
till
he
was
obliged
,
turned
*NL*
round
and
said
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
get
away
,
Maggie
;
there
's
no
room
for
you
on
the
grass
here
.
*NL*
Nobody
asked
_
you
_
to
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
passions
at
war
in
Maggie
at
that
moment
to
have
made
a
*NL*
tragedy
,
if
tragedies
were
made
by
passion
only
;
but
the
essential
*NL*
-LSB-
Greek
text
-RSB-
which
was
present
in
the
passion
was
wanting
to
the
action
;
*NL*
the
utmost
Maggie
could
do
,
with
a
fierce
thrust
of
her
small
brown
arm
,
*NL*
was
to
push
poor
little
pink-and-white
Lucy
into
the
cow-trodden
mud
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Tom
could
not
restrain
himself
,
and
gave
Maggie
two
smart
slaps
*NL*
on
the
arm
as
he
ran
to
pick
up
Lucy
,
who
lay
crying
helplessly
.
*NL*
Maggie
retreated
to
the
roots
of
a
tree
a
few
yards
off
,
and
looked
on
*NL*
impenitently
.
Usually
her
repentance
came
quickly
after
one
rash
deed
,
*NL*
but
now
Tom
and
Lucy
had
made
her
so
miserable
,
she
was
glad
to
spoil
*NL*
their
happiness
,
--
glad
to
make
everybody
uncomfortable
.
Why
should
she
*NL*
be
sorry
?
Tom
was
very
slow
to
forgive
_
her
_
,
however
sorry
she
might
*NL*
have
been
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
tell
mother
,
you
know
,
Miss
Mag
,
''
said
Tom
,
loudly
and
*NL*
emphatically
,
as
soon
as
Lucy
was
up
and
ready
to
walk
away
.
It
was
*NL*
not
Tom
's
practice
to
``
tell
,
''
but
here
justice
clearly
demanded
that
*NL*
Maggie
should
be
visited
with
the
utmost
punishment
;
not
that
Tom
had
*NL*
learned
to
put
his
views
in
that
abstract
form
;
he
never
mentioned
*NL*
``
justice
,
''
and
had
no
idea
that
his
desire
to
punish
might
be
called
*NL*
by
that
fine
name
.
Lucy
was
too
entirely
absorbed
by
the
evil
that
had
*NL*
befallen
her
,
--
the
spoiling
of
her
pretty
best
clothes
,
and
the
*NL*
discomfort
of
being
wet
and
dirty
,
--
to
think
much
of
the
cause
,
which
*NL*
was
entirely
mysterious
to
her
.
She
could
never
have
guessed
what
she
*NL*
had
done
to
make
Maggie
angry
with
her
;
but
she
felt
that
Maggie
was
*NL*
very
unkind
and
disagreeable
,
and
made
no
magnanimous
entreaties
to
*NL*
Tom
that
he
would
not
``
tell
,
''
only
running
along
by
his
side
and
*NL*
crying
piteously
,
while
Maggie
sat
on
the
roots
of
the
tree
and
looked
*NL*
after
them
with
her
small
Medusa
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sally
,
''
said
Tom
,
when
they
reached
the
kitchen
door
,
and
Sally
*NL*
looked
at
them
in
speechless
amaze
,
with
a
piece
of
bread-and-butter
*NL*
in
her
mouth
and
a
toasting-fork
in
her
hand
,
--
``
Sally
,
tell
mother
it
*NL*
was
Maggie
pushed
Lucy
into
the
mud
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
Lors
ha
'
massy
,
how
did
you
get
near
such
mud
as
that
?
''
said
*NL*
Sally
,
making
a
wry
face
,
as
she
stooped
down
and
examined
the
_
corpus
*NL*
delicti
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
's
imagination
had
not
been
rapid
and
capacious
enough
to
include
*NL*
this
question
among
the
foreseen
consequences
,
but
it
was
no
sooner
*NL*
put
than
he
foresaw
whither
it
tended
,
and
that
Maggie
would
not
be
*NL*
considered
the
only
culprit
in
the
case
.
He
walked
quietly
away
from
*NL*
the
kitchen
door
,
leaving
Sally
to
that
pleasure
of
guessing
which
*NL*
active
minds
notoriously
prefer
to
ready-made
knowledge
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sally
,
as
you
are
aware
,
lost
no
time
in
presenting
Lucy
at
the
parlor
*NL*
door
,
for
to
have
so
dirty
an
object
introduced
into
the
house
at
*NL*
Garum
Firs
was
too
great
a
weight
to
be
sustained
by
a
single
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Goodness
gracious
!
''
aunt
Pullet
exclaimed
,
after
preluding
by
an
*NL*
inarticulate
scream
;
``
keep
her
at
the
door
,
Sally
!
Do
n't
bring
her
off
*NL*
the
oil-cloth
,
whatever
you
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
she
's
tumbled
into
some
nasty
mud
,
''
said
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
going
up
*NL*
to
Lucy
to
examine
into
the
amount
of
damage
to
clothes
for
which
she
*NL*
felt
herself
responsible
to
her
sister
Deane
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
please
,
`
um
,
it
was
Miss
Maggie
as
pushed
her
in
,
''
said
Sally
;
*NL*
``
Master
Tom
's
been
and
said
so
,
and
they
must
ha
'
been
to
the
pond
,
*NL*
for
it
's
only
there
they
could
ha
'
got
into
such
dirt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
it
is
,
Bessy
;
it
's
what
I
've
been
telling
you
,
''
said
Mrs.
*NL*
Pullet
,
in
a
tone
of
prophetic
sadness
;
``
it
's
your
children
,
--
there
's
*NL*
no
knowing
what
they
'll
come
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Tulliver
was
mute
,
feeling
herself
a
truly
wretched
mother
.
As
*NL*
usual
,
the
thought
pressed
upon
her
that
people
would
think
she
had
*NL*
done
something
wicked
to
deserve
her
maternal
troubles
,
while
Mrs.
*NL*
Pullet
began
to
give
elaborate
directions
to
Sally
how
to
guard
the
*NL*
premises
from
serious
injury
in
the
course
of
removing
the
dirt
.
*NL*
Meantime
tea
was
to
be
brought
in
by
the
cook
,
and
the
two
naughty
*NL*
children
were
to
have
theirs
in
an
ignominious
manner
in
the
kitchen
.
*NL*
Mrs.
Tulliver
went
out
to
speak
to
these
naughty
children
,
supposing
*NL*
them
to
be
close
at
hand
;
but
it
was
not
until
after
some
search
that
*NL*
she
found
Tom
leaning
with
rather
a
hardened
,
careless
air
against
the
*NL*
white
paling
of
the
poultry-yard
,
and
lowering
his
piece
of
string
on
*NL*
the
other
side
as
a
means
of
exasperating
the
turkey-cock
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tom
,
you
naughty
boy
,
where
's
your
sister
?
''
said
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
in
a
*NL*
distressed
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
said
Tom
;
his
eagerness
for
justice
on
Maggie
had
*NL*
diminished
since
he
had
seen
clearly
that
it
could
hardly
be
brought
*NL*
about
without
the
injustice
of
some
blame
on
his
own
conduct
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
where
did
you
leave
her
?
''
said
the
mother
,
looking
round
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sitting
under
the
tree
,
against
the
pond
,
''
said
Tom
,
apparently
*NL*
indifferent
to
everything
but
the
string
and
the
turkey-cock
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
go
and
fetch
her
in
this
minute
,
you
naughty
boy
.
And
how
could
*NL*
you
think
o
'
going
to
the
pond
,
and
taking
your
sister
where
there
was
*NL*
dirt
?
You
know
she
'll
do
mischief
if
there
's
mischief
to
be
done
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
Mrs.
Tulliver
's
way
,
if
she
blamed
Tom
,
to
refer
his
*NL*
misdemeanor
,
somehow
or
other
,
to
Maggie
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
idea
of
Maggie
sitting
alone
by
the
pond
roused
an
habitual
fear
*NL*
in
Mrs.
Tulliver
's
mind
,
and
she
mounted
the
horse-block
to
satisfy
*NL*
herself
by
a
sight
of
that
fatal
child
,
while
Tom
walked
--
not
very
*NL*
quickly
--
on
his
way
toward
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
're
such
children
for
the
water
,
mine
are
,
''
she
said
aloud
,
*NL*
without
reflecting
that
there
was
no
one
to
hear
her
;
``
they
'll
be
*NL*
brought
in
dead
and
drownded
some
day
.
I
wish
that
river
was
far
*NL*
enough
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
when
she
not
only
failed
to
discern
Maggie
,
but
presently
saw
Tom
*NL*
returning
from
the
pool
alone
,
this
hovering
fear
entered
and
took
*NL*
complete
possession
of
her
,
and
she
hurried
to
meet
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Maggie
's
nowhere
about
the
pond
,
mother
,
''
said
Tom
;
``
she
's
gone
*NL*
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
You
may
conceive
the
terrified
search
for
Maggie
,
and
the
difficulty
*NL*
of
convincing
her
mother
that
she
was
not
in
the
pond
.
Mrs.
Pullet
*NL*
observed
that
the
child
might
come
to
a
worse
end
if
she
lived
,
there
*NL*
was
no
knowing
;
and
Mr.
Pullet
,
confused
and
overwhelmed
by
this
*NL*
revolutionary
aspect
of
things
,
--
the
tea
deferred
and
the
poultry
*NL*
alarmed
by
the
unusual
running
to
and
fro
,
--
took
up
his
spud
as
an
*NL*
instrument
of
search
,
and
reached
down
a
key
to
unlock
the
goose-pen
,
*NL*
as
a
likely
place
for
Maggie
to
lie
concealed
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
,
after
a
while
,
started
the
idea
that
Maggie
was
gone
home
*NL*
-LRB-
without
thinking
it
necessary
to
state
that
it
was
what
he
should
*NL*
have
done
himself
under
the
circumstances
-RRB-
,
and
the
suggestion
was
*NL*
seized
as
a
comfort
by
his
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sister
,
for
goodness
'
sake
let
'em
put
the
horse
in
the
carriage
and
*NL*
take
me
home
;
we
shall
perhaps
find
her
on
the
road
.
Lucy
ca
n't
walk
*NL*
in
her
dirty
clothes
,
''
she
said
,
looking
at
that
innocent
victim
,
who
*NL*
was
wrapped
up
in
a
shawl
,
and
sitting
with
naked
feet
on
the
sofa
.
*NL*
*NL*
Aunt
Pullet
was
quite
willing
to
take
the
shortest
means
of
restoring
*NL*
her
premises
to
order
and
quiet
,
and
it
was
not
long
before
Mrs.
*NL*
Tulliver
was
in
the
chaise
,
looking
anxiously
at
the
most
distant
*NL*
point
before
her
.
What
the
father
would
say
if
Maggie
was
lost
,
was
a
*NL*
question
that
predominated
over
every
other
.

Chapter

*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
Tries
to
Run
away
from
Her
Shadow
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
's
intentions
,
as
usual
,
were
on
a
larger
scale
than
Tom
*NL*
imagined
.
The
resolution
that
gathered
in
her
mind
,
after
Tom
and
Lucy
*NL*
had
walked
away
,
was
not
so
simple
as
that
of
going
home
.
No
!
she
*NL*
would
run
away
and
go
to
the
gypsies
,
and
Tom
should
never
see
her
any
*NL*
more
.
That
was
by
no
means
a
new
idea
to
Maggie
;
she
had
been
so
often
*NL*
told
she
was
like
a
gypsy
,
and
``
half
wild
,
''
that
when
she
was
*NL*
miserable
it
seemed
to
her
the
only
way
of
escaping
opprobrium
,
and
*NL*
being
entirely
in
harmony
with
circumstances
,
would
be
to
live
in
a
*NL*
little
brown
tent
on
the
commons
;
the
gypsies
,
she
considered
,
would
*NL*
gladly
receive
her
and
pay
her
much
respect
on
account
of
her
superior
*NL*
knowledge
.
She
had
once
mentioned
her
views
on
this
point
to
Tom
and
*NL*
suggested
that
he
should
stain
his
face
brown
,
and
they
should
run
*NL*
away
together
;
but
Tom
rejected
the
scheme
with
contempt
,
observing
*NL*
that
gypsies
were
thieves
,
and
hardly
got
anything
to
eat
and
had
*NL*
nothing
to
drive
but
a
donkey
.
To-day
however
,
Maggie
thought
her
*NL*
misery
had
reached
a
pitch
at
which
gypsydom
was
her
refuge
,
and
she
*NL*
rose
from
her
seat
on
the
roots
of
the
tree
with
the
sense
that
this
*NL*
was
a
great
crisis
in
her
life
;
she
would
run
straight
away
till
she
*NL*
came
to
Dunlow
Common
,
where
there
would
certainly
be
gypsies
;
and
*NL*
cruel
Tom
,
and
the
rest
of
her
relations
who
found
fault
with
her
,
*NL*
should
never
see
her
any
more
.
She
thought
of
her
father
as
she
ran
*NL*
along
,
but
she
reconciled
herself
to
the
idea
of
parting
with
him
,
by
*NL*
determining
that
she
would
secretly
send
him
a
letter
by
a
small
*NL*
gypsy
,
who
would
run
away
without
telling
where
she
was
,
and
just
let
*NL*
him
know
that
she
was
well
and
happy
,
and
always
loved
him
very
much
.
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
soon
got
out
of
breath
with
running
,
but
by
the
time
Tom
got
to
*NL*
the
pond
again
she
was
at
the
distance
of
three
long
fields
,
and
was
*NL*
on
the
edge
of
the
lane
leading
to
the
highroad
.
She
stopped
to
pant
a
*NL*
little
,
reflecting
that
running
away
was
not
a
pleasant
thing
until
*NL*
one
had
got
quite
to
the
common
where
the
gypsies
were
,
but
her
*NL*
resolution
had
not
abated
;
she
presently
passed
through
the
gate
into
*NL*
the
lane
,
not
knowing
where
it
would
lead
her
,
for
it
was
not
this
way
*NL*
that
they
came
from
Dorlcote
Mill
to
Garum
Firs
,
and
she
felt
all
the
*NL*
safer
for
that
,
because
there
was
no
chance
of
her
being
overtaken
.
*NL*
But
she
was
soon
aware
,
not
without
trembling
,
that
there
were
two
men
*NL*
coming
along
the
lane
in
front
of
her
;
she
had
not
thought
of
meeting
*NL*
strangers
,
she
had
been
too
much
occupied
with
the
idea
of
her
friends
*NL*
coming
after
her
.
The
formidable
strangers
were
two
shabby-looking
men
*NL*
with
flushed
faces
,
one
of
them
carrying
a
bundle
on
a
stick
over
his
*NL*
shoulder
;
but
to
her
surprise
,
while
she
was
dreading
their
*NL*
disapprobation
as
a
runaway
,
the
man
with
the
bundle
stopped
,
and
in
a
*NL*
half-whining
,
half-coaxing
tone
asked
her
if
she
had
a
copper
to
give
*NL*
a
poor
man
.
Maggie
had
a
sixpence
in
her
pocket
,
--
her
uncle
Glegg
's
*NL*
present
,
--
which
she
immediately
drew
out
and
gave
this
poor
man
with
a
*NL*
polite
smile
,
hoping
he
would
feel
very
kindly
toward
her
as
a
*NL*
generous
person
.
``
That
's
the
only
money
I
've
got
,
''
she
said
*NL*
apologetically
.
``
Thank
you
,
little
miss
,
''
said
the
man
,
in
a
less
*NL*
respectful
and
grateful
tone
than
Maggie
anticipated
,
and
she
even
*NL*
observed
that
he
smiled
and
winked
at
his
companion
.
She
walked
on
*NL*
hurriedly
,
but
was
aware
that
the
two
men
were
standing
still
,
*NL*
probably
to
look
after
her
,
and
she
presently
heard
them
laughing
*NL*
loudly
.
Suddenly
it
occurred
to
her
that
they
might
think
she
was
an
*NL*
idiot
;
Tom
had
said
that
her
cropped
hair
made
her
look
like
an
idiot
,
*NL*
and
it
was
too
painful
an
idea
to
be
readily
forgotten
.
Besides
,
she
*NL*
had
no
sleeves
on
,
--
only
a
cape
and
bonnet
.
It
was
clear
that
she
was
*NL*
not
likely
to
make
a
favorable
impression
on
passengers
,
and
she
*NL*
thought
she
would
turn
into
the
fields
again
,
but
not
on
the
same
side
*NL*
of
the
lane
as
before
,
lest
they
should
still
be
uncle
Pullet
's
*NL*
fields
.
She
turned
through
the
first
gate
that
was
not
locked
,
and
*NL*
felt
a
delightful
sense
of
privacy
in
creeping
along
by
the
hedgerows
,
*NL*
after
her
recent
humiliating
encounter
.
She
was
used
to
wandering
*NL*
about
the
fields
by
herself
,
and
was
less
timid
there
than
on
the
*NL*
highroad
.
Sometimes
she
had
to
climb
over
high
gates
,
but
that
was
a
*NL*
small
evil
;
she
was
getting
out
of
reach
very
fast
,
and
she
should
*NL*
probably
soon
come
within
sight
of
Dunlow
Common
,
or
at
least
of
some
*NL*
other
common
,
for
she
had
heard
her
father
say
that
you
could
n't
go
*NL*
very
far
without
coming
to
a
common
.
She
hoped
so
,
for
she
was
getting
*NL*
rather
tired
and
hungry
,
and
until
she
reached
the
gypsies
there
was
*NL*
no
definite
prospect
of
bread
and
butter
.
It
was
still
broad
daylight
,
*NL*
for
aunt
Pullet
,
retaining
the
early
habits
of
the
Dodson
family
,
took
*NL*
tea
at
half-past
four
by
the
sun
,
and
at
five
by
the
kitchen
clock
;
*NL*
so
,
though
it
was
nearly
an
hour
since
Maggie
started
,
there
was
no
*NL*
gathering
gloom
on
the
fields
to
remind
her
that
the
night
would
come
.
*NL*
Still
,
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
had
been
walking
a
very
great
*NL*
distance
indeed
,
and
it
was
really
surprising
that
the
common
did
not
*NL*
come
within
sight
.
Hitherto
she
had
been
in
the
rich
parish
of
Garum
,
*NL*
where
was
a
great
deal
of
pasture-land
,
and
she
had
only
seen
one
*NL*
laborer
at
a
distance
.
That
was
fortunate
in
some
respects
,
as
*NL*
laborers
might
be
too
ignorant
to
understand
the
propriety
of
her
*NL*
wanting
to
go
to
Dunlow
Common
;
yet
it
would
have
been
better
if
she
*NL*
could
have
met
some
one
who
would
tell
her
the
way
without
wanting
to
*NL*
know
anything
about
her
private
business
.
At
last
,
however
,
the
green
*NL*
fields
came
to
an
end
,
and
Maggie
found
herself
looking
through
the
*NL*
bars
of
a
gate
into
a
lane
with
a
wide
margin
of
grass
on
each
side
of
*NL*
it
.
She
had
never
seen
such
a
wide
lane
before
,
and
,
without
her
*NL*
knowing
why
,
it
gave
her
the
impression
that
the
common
could
not
be
*NL*
far
off
;
perhaps
it
was
because
she
saw
a
donkey
with
a
log
to
his
*NL*
foot
feeding
on
the
grassy
margin
,
for
she
had
seen
a
donkey
with
that
*NL*
pitiable
encumbrance
on
Dunlow
Common
when
she
had
been
across
it
in
*NL*
her
father
's
gig
.
She
crept
through
the
bars
of
the
gate
and
walked
on
*NL*
with
new
spirit
,
though
not
without
haunting
images
of
Apollyon
,
and
a
*NL*
highwayman
with
a
pistol
,
and
a
blinking
dwarf
in
yellow
with
a
mouth
*NL*
from
ear
to
ear
,
and
other
miscellaneous
dangers
.
For
poor
little
*NL*
Maggie
had
at
once
the
timidity
of
an
active
imagination
and
the
*NL*
daring
that
comes
from
overmastering
impulse
.
She
had
rushed
into
the
*NL*
adventure
of
seeking
her
unknown
kindred
,
the
gypsies
;
and
now
she
was
*NL*
in
this
strange
lane
,
she
hardly
dared
look
on
one
side
of
her
,
lest
*NL*
she
should
see
the
diabolical
blacksmith
in
his
leathern
apron
*NL*
grinning
at
her
with
arms
akimbo
.
It
was
not
without
a
leaping
of
the
*NL*
heart
that
she
caught
sight
of
a
small
pair
of
bare
legs
sticking
up
,
*NL*
feet
uppermost
,
by
the
side
of
a
hillock
;
they
seemed
something
*NL*
hideously
preternatural
,
--
a
diabolical
kind
of
fungus
;
for
she
was
too
*NL*
much
agitated
at
the
first
glance
to
see
the
ragged
clothes
and
the
*NL*
dark
shaggy
head
attached
to
them
.
It
was
a
boy
asleep
,
and
Maggie
*NL*
trotted
along
faster
and
more
lightly
,
lest
she
should
wake
him
;
it
*NL*
did
not
occur
to
her
that
he
was
one
of
her
friends
the
gypsies
,
who
*NL*
in
all
probability
would
have
very
genial
manners
.
But
the
fact
was
*NL*
so
,
for
at
the
next
bend
in
the
lane
Maggie
actually
saw
the
little
*NL*
semicircular
black
tent
with
the
blue
smoke
rising
before
it
,
which
*NL*
was
to
be
her
refuge
from
all
the
blighting
obloquy
that
had
pursued
*NL*
her
in
civilized
life
.
She
even
saw
a
tall
female
figure
by
the
column
*NL*
of
smoke
,
doubtless
the
gypsy-mother
,
who
provided
the
tea
and
other
*NL*
groceries
;
it
was
astonishing
to
herself
that
she
did
not
feel
more
*NL*
delighted
.
But
it
was
startling
to
find
the
gypsies
in
a
lane
,
after
*NL*
all
,
and
not
on
a
common
;
indeed
,
it
was
rather
disappointing
;
for
a
*NL*
mysterious
illimitable
common
,
where
there
were
sand-pits
to
hide
in
,
*NL*
and
one
was
out
of
everybody
's
reach
,
had
always
made
part
of
Maggie
's
*NL*
picture
of
gypsy
life
.
She
went
on
,
however
,
and
thought
with
some
*NL*
comfort
that
gypsies
most
likely
knew
nothing
about
idiots
,
so
there
*NL*
was
no
danger
of
their
falling
into
the
mistake
of
setting
her
down
at
*NL*
the
first
glance
as
an
idiot
.
It
was
plain
she
had
attracted
*NL*
attention
;
for
the
tall
figure
,
who
proved
to
be
a
young
woman
with
a
*NL*
baby
on
her
arm
,
walked
slowly
to
meet
her
.
Maggie
looked
up
in
the
*NL*
new
face
rather
tremblingly
as
it
approached
,
and
was
reassured
by
the
*NL*
thought
that
her
aunt
Pullet
and
the
rest
were
right
when
they
called
*NL*
her
a
gypsy
;
for
this
face
,
with
the
bright
dark
eyes
and
the
long
*NL*
hair
,
was
really
something
like
what
she
used
to
see
in
the
glass
*NL*
before
she
cut
her
hair
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
little
lady
,
where
are
you
going
to
?
''
the
gypsy
said
,
in
a
tone
of
*NL*
coaxing
deference
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
delightful
,
and
just
what
Maggie
expected
;
the
gypsies
saw
at
*NL*
once
that
she
was
a
little
lady
,
and
were
prepared
to
treat
her
*NL*
accordingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
any
farther
,
''
said
Maggie
,
feeling
as
if
she
were
saying
what
she
*NL*
had
rehearsed
in
a
dream
.
``
I
'm
come
to
stay
with
_
you
_
,
please
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
pretty
;
come
,
then
.
Why
,
what
a
nice
little
lady
you
are
,
to
*NL*
be
sure
!
''
said
the
gypsy
,
taking
her
by
the
hand
.
Maggie
thought
her
*NL*
very
agreeable
,
but
wished
she
had
not
been
so
dirty
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
quite
a
group
round
the
fire
when
she
reached
it
.
An
old
*NL*
gypsy
woman
was
seated
on
the
ground
nursing
her
knees
,
and
*NL*
occasionally
poking
a
skewer
into
the
round
kettle
that
sent
forth
an
*NL*
odorous
steam
;
two
small
shock-headed
children
were
lying
prone
and
*NL*
resting
on
their
elbows
something
like
small
sphinxes
;
and
a
placid
*NL*
donkey
was
bending
his
head
over
a
tall
girl
,
who
,
lying
on
her
back
,
*NL*
was
scratching
his
nose
and
indulging
him
with
a
bite
of
excellent
*NL*
stolen
hay
.
The
slanting
sunlight
fell
kindly
upon
them
,
and
the
scene
*NL*
was
really
very
pretty
and
comfortable
,
Maggie
thought
,
only
she
hoped
*NL*
they
would
soon
set
out
the
tea-cups
.
Everything
would
be
quite
*NL*
charming
when
she
had
taught
the
gypsies
to
use
a
washing-basin
,
and
*NL*
to
feel
an
interest
in
books
.
It
was
a
little
confusing
,
though
,
that
*NL*
the
young
woman
began
to
speak
to
the
old
one
in
a
language
which
*NL*
Maggie
did
not
understand
,
while
the
tall
girl
,
who
was
feeding
the
*NL*
donkey
,
sat
up
and
stared
at
her
without
offering
any
salutation
.
At
*NL*
last
the
old
woman
said
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
my
pretty
lady
,
are
you
come
to
stay
with
us
?
Sit
ye
down
and
*NL*
tell
us
where
you
come
from
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
just
like
a
story
;
Maggie
liked
to
be
called
pretty
lady
and
*NL*
treated
in
this
way
.
She
sat
down
and
said
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
come
from
home
because
I
'm
unhappy
,
and
I
mean
to
be
a
gypsy
.
*NL*
I
'll
live
with
you
if
you
like
,
and
I
can
teach
you
a
great
many
*NL*
things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Such
a
clever
little
lady
,
''
said
the
woman
with
the
baby
sitting
down
*NL*
by
Maggie
,
and
allowing
baby
to
crawl
;
``
and
such
a
pretty
bonnet
and
*NL*
frock
,
''
she
added
,
taking
off
Maggie
's
bonnet
and
looking
at
it
while
*NL*
she
made
an
observation
to
the
old
woman
,
in
the
unknown
language
.
The
*NL*
tall
girl
snatched
the
bonnet
and
put
it
on
her
own
head
hind-foremost
*NL*
with
a
grin
;
but
Maggie
was
determined
not
to
show
any
weakness
on
*NL*
this
subject
,
as
if
she
were
susceptible
about
her
bonnet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
want
to
wear
a
bonnet
,
''
she
said
;
``
I
'd
rather
wear
a
red
*NL*
handkerchief
,
like
yours
''
-LRB-
looking
at
her
friend
by
her
side
-RRB-
.
``
My
*NL*
hair
was
quite
long
till
yesterday
,
when
I
cut
it
off
;
but
I
dare
say
*NL*
it
will
grow
again
very
soon
,
''
she
added
apologetically
,
thinking
it
*NL*
probable
the
gypsies
had
a
strong
prejudice
in
favor
of
long
hair
.
And
*NL*
Maggie
had
forgotten
even
her
hunger
at
that
moment
in
the
desire
to
*NL*
conciliate
gypsy
opinion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
what
a
nice
little
lady
!
--
and
rich
,
I
'm
sure
,
''
said
the
old
*NL*
woman
.
``
Did
n't
you
live
in
a
beautiful
house
at
home
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
my
home
is
pretty
,
and
I
'm
very
fond
of
the
river
,
where
we
go
*NL*
fishing
,
but
I
'm
often
very
unhappy
.
I
should
have
liked
to
bring
my
*NL*
books
with
me
,
but
I
came
away
in
a
hurry
,
you
know
.
But
I
can
tell
*NL*
you
almost
everything
there
is
in
my
books
,
I
've
read
them
so
many
*NL*
times
,
and
that
will
amuse
you
.
And
I
can
tell
you
something
about
*NL*
Geography
too
,
--
that
's
about
the
world
we
live
in
,
--
very
useful
and
*NL*
interesting
.
Did
you
ever
hear
about
Columbus
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
's
eyes
had
begun
to
sparkle
and
her
cheeks
to
flush
,
--
she
was
*NL*
really
beginning
to
instruct
the
gypsies
,
and
gaining
great
influence
*NL*
over
them
.
The
gypsies
themselves
were
not
without
amazement
at
this
*NL*
talk
,
though
their
attention
was
divided
by
the
contents
of
Maggie
's
*NL*
pocket
,
which
the
friend
at
her
right
hand
had
by
this
time
emptied
*NL*
without
attracting
her
notice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
where
you
live
,
my
little
lady
?
''
said
the
old
woman
,
at
the
*NL*
mention
of
Columbus
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
!
''
said
Maggie
,
with
some
pity
;
``
Columbus
was
a
very
wonderful
*NL*
man
,
who
found
out
half
the
world
,
and
they
put
chains
on
him
and
*NL*
treated
him
very
badly
,
you
know
;
it
's
in
my
Catechism
of
Geography
,
*NL*
but
perhaps
it
's
rather
too
long
to
tell
before
tea
--
_
I
want
my
tea
*NL*
so
_

*NL*
*NL*
The
last
words
burst
from
Maggie
,
in
spite
of
herself
,
with
a
sudden
*NL*
drop
from
patronizing
instruction
to
simple
peevishness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
she
's
hungry
,
poor
little
lady
,
''
said
the
younger
woman
.
``
Give
*NL*
her
some
o
'
the
cold
victual
.
You
've
been
walking
a
good
way
,
I
'll
be
*NL*
bound
,
my
dear
.
Where
's
your
home
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
Dorlcote
Mill
,
a
good
way
off
,
''
said
Maggie
.
``
My
father
is
Mr.
*NL*
Tulliver
,
but
we
must
n't
let
him
know
where
I
am
,
else
he
'll
fetch
me
*NL*
home
again
.
Where
does
the
queen
of
the
gypsies
live
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
do
you
want
to
go
to
her
,
my
little
lady
?
''
said
the
younger
*NL*
woman
.
The
tall
girl
meanwhile
was
constantly
staring
at
Maggie
and
*NL*
grinning
.
Her
manners
were
certainly
not
agreeable
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Maggie
,
``
I
'm
only
thinking
that
if
she
is
n't
a
very
good
*NL*
queen
you
might
be
glad
when
she
died
,
and
you
could
choose
another
.
*NL*
If
I
was
a
queen
,
I
'd
be
a
very
good
queen
,
and
kind
to
everybody
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
's
a
bit
o
'
nice
victual
,
then
,
''
said
the
old
woman
,
handing
to
*NL*
Maggie
a
lump
of
dry
bread
,
which
she
had
taken
from
a
bag
of
scraps
,
*NL*
and
a
piece
of
cold
bacon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
'
said
Maggie
,
looking
at
the
food
without
taking
it
;
``
but
*NL*
will
you
give
me
some
bread-and-butter
and
tea
instead
?
I
do
n't
like
*NL*
bacon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
've
got
no
tea
nor
butter
,
''
said
the
old
woman
,
with
something
like
*NL*
a
scowl
,
as
if
she
were
getting
tired
of
coaxing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
a
little
bread
and
treacle
would
do
,
''
said
Maggie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
ha
n't
got
no
treacle
,
''
said
the
old
woman
,
crossly
,
whereupon
*NL*
there
followed
a
sharp
dialogue
between
the
two
women
in
their
unknown
*NL*
tongue
,
and
one
of
the
small
sphinxes
snatched
at
the
bread-and-bacon
,
*NL*
and
began
to
eat
it
.
At
this
moment
the
tall
girl
,
who
had
gone
a
few
*NL*
yards
off
,
came
back
,
and
said
something
which
produced
a
strong
*NL*
effect
.
The
old
woman
,
seeming
to
forget
Maggie
's
hunger
,
poked
the
*NL*
skewer
into
the
pot
with
new
vigor
,
and
the
younger
crept
under
the
*NL*
tent
and
reached
out
some
platters
and
spoons
.
Maggie
trembled
a
*NL*
little
,
and
was
afraid
the
tears
would
come
into
her
eyes
.
Meanwhile
*NL*
the
tall
girl
gave
a
shrill
cry
,
and
presently
came
running
up
the
boy
*NL*
whom
Maggie
had
passed
as
he
was
sleeping
,
--
a
rough
urchin
about
the
*NL*
age
of
Tom
.
He
stared
at
Maggie
,
and
there
ensued
much
incomprehensible
*NL*
chattering
.
She
felt
very
lonely
,
and
was
quite
sure
she
should
begin
to
*NL*
cry
before
long
;
the
gypsies
did
n't
seem
to
mind
her
at
all
,
and
she
felt
*NL*
quite
weak
among
them
.
But
the
springing
tears
were
checked
by
new
*NL*
terror
,
when
two
men
came
up
,
whose
approach
had
been
the
cause
*NL*
of
the
sudden
excitement
.
The
elder
of
the
two
carried
a
bag
,
which
*NL*
he
flung
down
,
addressing
the
women
in
a
loud
and
scolding
tone
,
*NL*
which
they
answered
by
a
shower
of
treble
sauciness
;
while
a
black
*NL*
cur
ran
barking
up
to
Maggie
,
and
threw
her
into
a
tremor
that
only
*NL*
found
a
new
cause
in
the
curses
with
which
the
younger
man
called
*NL*
the
dog
off
,
and
gave
him
a
rap
with
a
great
stick
he
held
in
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
felt
that
it
was
impossible
she
should
ever
be
queen
of
these
*NL*
people
,
or
ever
communicate
to
them
amusing
and
useful
knowledge
.
*NL*
*NL*
Both
the
men
now
seemed
to
be
inquiring
about
Maggie
,
for
they
looked
*NL*
at
her
,
and
the
tone
of
the
conversation
became
of
that
pacific
kind
*NL*
which
implies
curiosity
on
one
side
and
the
power
of
satisfying
it
on
*NL*
the
other
.
At
last
the
younger
woman
said
in
her
previous
deferential
,
*NL*
coaxing
tone
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
nice
little
lady
's
come
to
live
with
us
;
are
n't
you
glad
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
very
glad
,
''
said
the
younger
man
,
who
was
looking
at
Maggie
's
*NL*
silver
thimble
and
other
small
matters
that
had
been
taken
from
her
*NL*
pocket
.
He
returned
them
all
except
the
thimble
to
the
younger
woman
,
*NL*
with
some
observation
,
and
she
immediately
restored
them
to
Maggie
's
*NL*
pocket
,
while
the
men
seated
themselves
,
and
began
to
attack
the
*NL*
contents
of
the
kettle
,
--
a
stew
of
meat
and
potatoes
,
--
which
had
been
*NL*
taken
off
the
fire
and
turned
out
into
a
yellow
platter
.
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
began
to
think
that
Tom
must
be
right
about
the
gypsies
;
they
*NL*
must
certainly
be
thieves
,
unless
the
man
meant
to
return
her
thimble
*NL*
by
and
by
.
She
would
willingly
have
given
it
to
him
,
for
she
was
not
*NL*
at
all
attached
to
her
thimble
;
but
the
idea
that
she
was
among
*NL*
thieves
prevented
her
from
feeling
any
comfort
in
the
revival
of
*NL*
deference
and
attention
toward
her
;
all
thieves
,
except
Robin
Hood
,
*NL*
were
wicked
people
.
The
women
saw
she
was
frightened
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
've
got
nothing
nice
for
a
lady
to
eat
,
''
said
the
old
woman
,
in
her
*NL*
coaxing
tone
.
``
And
she
's
so
hungry
,
sweet
little
lady
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
,
my
dear
,
try
if
you
can
eat
a
bit
o
'
this
,
''
said
the
younger
*NL*
woman
,
handing
some
of
the
stew
on
a
brown
dish
with
an
iron
spoon
to
*NL*
Maggie
,
who
,
remembering
that
the
old
woman
had
seemed
angry
with
her
*NL*
for
not
liking
the
bread-and-bacon
,
dared
not
refuse
the
stew
,
though
*NL*
fear
had
chased
away
her
appetite
.
If
her
father
would
but
come
by
in
*NL*
the
gig
and
take
her
up
!
Or
even
if
Jack
the
Giantkiller
,
or
Mr.
*NL*
Greatheart
,
or
St.
George
who
slew
the
dragon
on
the
half-pennies
,
*NL*
would
happen
to
pass
that
way
!
But
Maggie
thought
with
a
sinking
heart
*NL*
that
these
heroes
were
never
seen
in
the
neighborhood
of
St.
Ogg
's
;
*NL*
nothing
very
wonderful
ever
came
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
Tulliver
,
you
perceive
,
was
by
no
means
that
well
trained
,
*NL*
well-informed
young
person
that
a
small
female
of
eight
or
nine
*NL*
necessarily
is
in
these
days
;
she
had
only
been
to
school
a
year
at
*NL*
St.
Ogg
's
,
and
had
so
few
books
that
she
sometimes
read
the
*NL*
dictionary
;
so
that
in
travelling
over
her
small
mind
you
would
have
*NL*
found
the
most
unexpected
ignorance
as
well
as
unexpected
knowledge
.
*NL*
She
could
have
informed
you
that
there
was
such
a
word
as
``
polygamy
,
''
*NL*
and
being
also
acquainted
with
``
polysyllable
,
''
she
had
deduced
the
*NL*
conclusion
that
``
poly
''
mean
``
many
''
;
but
she
had
had
no
idea
that
*NL*
gypsies
were
not
well
supplied
with
groceries
,
and
her
thoughts
*NL*
generally
were
the
oddest
mixture
of
clear-eyed
acumen
and
blind
*NL*
dreams
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
ideas
about
the
gypsies
had
undergone
a
rapid
modification
in
the
*NL*
last
five
minutes
.
From
having
considered
them
very
respectful
*NL*
companions
,
amenable
to
instruction
,
she
had
begun
to
think
that
they
*NL*
meant
perhaps
to
kill
her
as
soon
as
it
was
dark
,
and
cut
up
her
body
*NL*
for
gradual
cooking
;
the
suspicion
crossed
her
that
the
fierce-eyed
*NL*
old
man
was
in
fact
the
Devil
,
who
might
drop
that
transparent
*NL*
disguise
at
any
moment
,
and
turn
either
into
the
grinning
blacksmith
,
*NL*
or
else
a
fiery-eyed
monster
with
dragon
's
wings
.
It
was
no
use
trying
*NL*
to
eat
the
stew
,
and
yet
the
thing
she
most
dreaded
was
to
offend
the
*NL*
gypsies
,
by
betraying
her
extremely
unfavorable
opinion
of
them
;
and
*NL*
she
wondered
,
with
a
keenness
of
interest
that
no
theologian
could
*NL*
have
exceeded
,
whether
,
if
the
Devil
were
really
present
,
he
would
*NL*
know
her
thoughts
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
you
do
n't
like
the
smell
of
it
,
my
dear
,
''
said
the
young
woman
,
*NL*
observing
that
Maggie
did
not
even
take
a
spoonful
of
the
stew
.
``
Try
a
*NL*
bit
,
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
thank
you
,
''
said
Maggie
,
summoning
all
her
force
for
a
desperate
*NL*
effort
,
and
trying
to
smile
in
a
friendly
way
.
``
I
have
n't
time
,
I
*NL*
think
;
it
seems
getting
darker
.
I
think
I
must
go
home
now
,
and
come
*NL*
again
another
day
,
and
then
I
can
bring
you
a
basket
with
some
*NL*
jam-tarts
and
things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
rose
from
her
seat
as
she
threw
out
this
illusory
prospect
,
*NL*
devoutly
hoping
that
Apollyon
was
gullible
;
but
her
hope
sank
when
the
*NL*
old
gypsy-woman
said
,
``
Stop
a
bit
,
stop
a
bit
,
little
lady
;
we
'll
take
*NL*
you
home
,
all
safe
,
when
we
've
done
supper
;
you
shall
ride
home
,
like
*NL*
a
lady
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
sat
down
again
,
with
little
faith
in
this
promise
,
though
she
*NL*
presently
saw
the
tall
girl
putting
a
bridle
on
the
donkey
,
and
*NL*
throwing
a
couple
of
bags
on
his
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
then
,
little
missis
,
''
said
the
younger
man
,
rising
,
and
leading
*NL*
the
donkey
forward
,
``
tell
us
where
you
live
;
what
's
the
name
o
'
the
*NL*
place
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dorlcote
Mill
is
my
home
,
''
said
Maggie
,
eagerly
.
``
My
father
is
Mr.
*NL*
Tulliver
;
he
lives
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
a
big
mill
a
little
way
this
side
o
'
St.
Ogg
's
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Maggie
.
``
Is
it
far
off
?
I
think
I
should
like
to
walk
*NL*
there
,
if
you
please
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
it
'll
be
getting
dark
,
we
must
make
haste
.
And
the
donkey
'll
*NL*
carry
you
as
nice
as
can
be
;
you
'll
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
lifted
Maggie
as
he
spoke
,
and
set
her
on
the
donkey
.
She
felt
*NL*
relieved
that
it
was
not
the
old
man
who
seemed
to
be
going
with
her
,
*NL*
but
she
had
only
a
trembling
hope
that
she
was
really
going
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
's
your
pretty
bonnet
,
''
said
the
younger
woman
,
putting
that
*NL*
recently
despised
but
now
welcome
article
of
costume
on
Maggie
's
head
;
*NL*
``
and
you
'll
say
we
've
been
very
good
to
you
,
wo
n't
you
?
and
what
a
*NL*
nice
little
lady
we
said
you
was
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
,
thank
you
,
''
said
Maggie
,
``
I
'm
very
much
obliged
to
you
.
But
I
*NL*
wish
you
'd
go
with
me
too
.
''
She
thought
anything
was
better
than
going
*NL*
with
one
of
the
dreadful
men
alone
;
it
would
be
more
cheerful
to
be
*NL*
murdered
by
a
larger
party
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
you
're
fondest
o
'
_
me
_
,
are
n't
you
?
''
said
the
woman
.
``
But
I
ca
n't
*NL*
go
;
you
'll
go
too
fast
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
now
appeared
that
the
man
also
was
to
be
seated
on
the
donkey
,
*NL*
holding
Maggie
before
him
,
and
she
was
as
incapable
of
remonstrating
*NL*
against
this
arrangement
as
the
donkey
himself
,
though
no
nightmare
*NL*
had
ever
seemed
to
her
more
horrible
.
When
the
woman
had
patted
her
on
*NL*
the
back
,
and
said
``
Good-by
,
''
the
donkey
,
at
a
strong
hint
from
the
*NL*
man
's
stick
,
set
off
at
a
rapid
walk
along
the
lane
toward
the
point
*NL*
Maggie
had
come
from
an
hour
ago
,
while
the
tall
girl
and
the
rough
*NL*
urchin
,
also
furnished
with
sticks
,
obligingly
escorted
them
for
the
*NL*
first
hundred
yards
,
with
much
screaming
and
thwacking
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
Leonore
,
in
that
preternatural
midnight
excursion
with
her
phantom
*NL*
lover
,
was
more
terrified
than
poor
Maggie
in
this
entirely
natural
*NL*
ride
on
a
short-paced
donkey
,
with
a
gypsy
behind
her
,
who
considered
*NL*
that
he
was
earning
half
a
crown
.
The
red
light
of
the
setting
sun
*NL*
seemed
to
have
a
portentous
meaning
,
with
which
the
alarming
bray
of
*NL*
the
second
donkey
with
the
log
on
its
foot
must
surely
have
some
*NL*
connection
.
Two
low
thatched
cottages
--
the
only
houses
they
passed
in
*NL*
this
lane
--
seemed
to
add
to
its
dreariness
;
they
had
no
windows
to
*NL*
speak
of
,
and
the
doors
were
closed
;
it
was
probable
that
they
were
*NL*
inhabitated
by
witches
,
and
it
was
a
relief
to
find
that
the
donkey
*NL*
did
not
stop
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
--
oh
,
sight
of
joy
!
--
this
lane
,
the
longest
in
the
world
,
was
*NL*
coming
to
an
end
,
was
opening
on
a
broad
highroad
,
where
there
was
*NL*
actually
a
coach
passing
!
And
there
was
a
finger-post
at
the
*NL*
corner
,
--
she
had
surely
seen
that
finger-post
before
,
--
``
To
St.
Ogg
's
,
*NL*
2

The
gypsy
really
meant
to
take
her
home
,
then
;
he
was
*NL*
probably
a
good
man
,
after
all
,
and
might
have
been
rather
hurt
at
the
*NL*
thought
that
she
did
n't
like
coming
with
him
alone
.
This
idea
became
*NL*
stronger
as
she
felt
more
and
more
certain
that
she
knew
the
road
*NL*
quite
well
,
and
she
was
considering
how
she
might
open
a
conversation
*NL*
with
the
injured
gypsy
,
and
not
only
gratify
his
feelings
but
efface
*NL*
the
impression
of
her
cowardice
,
when
,
as
they
reached
a
cross-road
.
*NL*
Maggie
caught
sight
of
some
one
coming
on
a
white-faced
horse
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
stop
,
stop
!
''
she
cried
out
.
``
There
's
my
father
!
Oh
,
father
,
*NL*
father
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
sudden
joy
was
almost
painful
,
and
before
her
father
reached
her
,
*NL*
she
was
sobbing
.
Great
was
Mr.
Tulliver
's
wonder
,
for
he
had
made
a
*NL*
round
from
Basset
,
and
had
not
yet
been
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
what
's
the
meaning
o
'
this
?
''
he
said
,
checking
his
horse
,
while
*NL*
Maggie
slipped
from
the
donkey
and
ran
to
her
father
's
stirrup
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
little
miss
lost
herself
,
I
reckon
,
''
said
the
gypsy
.
``
She
'd
come
*NL*
to
our
tent
at
the
far
end
o
'
Dunlow
Lane
,
and
I
was
bringing
her
*NL*
where
she
said
her
home
was
.
It
's
a
good
way
to
come
after
being
on
*NL*
the
tramp
all
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
,
father
,
he
's
been
very
good
to
bring
me
home
,
''
said
*NL*
Maggie
,
--
``
a
very
kind
,
good
man
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
,
then
,
my
man
,
''
said
Mr.
Tulliver
,
taking
out
five
shillings
.
*NL*
``
It
's
the
best
day
's
work
_
you
_
ever
did
.
I
could
n't
afford
to
lose
*NL*
the
little
wench
;
here
,
lift
her
up
before
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
Maggie
,
how
's
this
,
how
's
this
?
''
he
said
,
as
they
rode
along
,
*NL*
while
she
laid
her
head
against
her
father
and
sobbed
.
``
How
came
you
*NL*
to
be
rambling
about
and
lose
yourself
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
father
,
''
sobbed
Maggie
,
``
I
ran
away
because
I
was
so
unhappy
;
Tom
*NL*
was
so
angry
with
me
.
I
could
n't
bear
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pooh
,
pooh
,
''
said
Mr.
Tulliver
,
soothingly
,
``
you
must
n't
think
o
'
*NL*
running
away
from
father
.
What
`
ud
father
do
without
his
little
*NL*
wench
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
,
I
never
will
again
,
father
--
never
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Tulliver
spoke
his
mind
very
strongly
when
he
reached
home
that
*NL*
evening
;
and
the
effect
was
seen
in
the
remarkable
fact
that
Maggie
*NL*
never
heard
one
reproach
from
her
mother
,
or
one
taunt
from
Tom
,
about
*NL*
this
foolish
business
of
her
running
away
to
the
gypsies
.
Maggie
was
*NL*
rather
awe-stricken
by
this
unusual
treatment
,
and
sometimes
thought
*NL*
that
her
conduct
had
been
too
wicked
to
be
alluded
to
.

*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Glegg
at
Home
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
In
order
to
see
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Glegg
at
home
,
we
must
enter
the
town
of
*NL*
St.
Ogg
's
,
--
that
venerable
town
with
the
red
fluted
roofs
and
the
*NL*
broad
warehouse
gables
,
where
the
black
ships
unlade
themselves
of
*NL*
their
burthens
from
the
far
north
,
and
carry
away
,
in
exchange
,
the
*NL*
precious
inland
products
,
the
well-crushed
cheese
and
the
soft
fleeces
*NL*
which
my
refined
readers
have
doubtless
become
acquainted
with
through
*NL*
the
medium
of
the
best
classic
pastorals
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
one
of
those
old
,
old
towns
which
impress
one
as
a
continuation
*NL*
and
outgrowth
of
nature
,
as
much
as
the
nests
of
the
bower-birds
or
*NL*
the
winding
galleries
of
the
white
ants
;
a
town
which
carries
the
*NL*
traces
of
its
long
growth
and
history
like
a
millennial
tree
,
and
has
*NL*
sprung
up
and
developed
in
the
same
spot
between
the
river
and
the
low
*NL*
hill
from
the
time
when
the
Roman
legions
turned
their
backs
on
it
*NL*
from
the
camp
on
the
hillside
,
and
the
long-haired
sea-kings
came
up
*NL*
the
river
and
looked
with
fierce
,
eager
eyes
at
the
fatness
of
the
*NL*
land
.
It
is
a
town
``
familiar
with
forgotten
years
.
''
The
shadow
of
the
*NL*
Saxon
hero-king
still
walks
there
fitfully
,
reviewing
the
scenes
of
*NL*
his
youth
and
love-time
,
and
is
met
by
the
gloomier
shadow
of
the
*NL*
dreadful
heathen
Dane
,
who
was
stabbed
in
the
midst
of
his
warriors
by
*NL*
the
sword
of
an
invisible
avenger
,
and
who
rises
on
autumn
evenings
*NL*
like
a
white
mist
from
his
tumulus
on
the
hill
,
and
hovers
in
the
*NL*
court
of
the
old
hall
by
the
river-side
,
the
spot
where
he
was
thus
*NL*
miraculously
slain
in
the
days
before
the
old
hall
was
built
.
It
was
*NL*
the
Normans
who
began
to
build
that
fine
old
hall
,
which
is
,
like
the
*NL*
town
,
telling
of
the
thoughts
and
hands
of
widely
sundered
*NL*
generations
;
but
it
is
all
so
old
that
we
look
with
loving
pardon
at
*NL*
its
inconsistencies
,
and
are
well
content
that
they
who
built
the
*NL*
stone
oriel
,
and
they
who
built
the
Gothic
facade
and
towers
of
finest
*NL*
small
brickwork
with
the
trefoil
ornament
,
and
the
windows
and
*NL*
battlements
defined
with
stone
,
did
not
sacreligiously
pull
down
the
*NL*
ancient
half-timbered
body
with
its
oak-roofed
banqueting-hall
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
older
even
than
this
old
hall
is
perhaps
the
bit
of
wall
now
built
*NL*
into
the
belfry
of
the
parish
church
,
and
said
to
be
a
remnant
of
the
*NL*
original
chapel
dedicated
to
St.
Ogg
,
the
patron
saint
of
this
ancient
*NL*
town
,
of
whose
history
I
possess
several
manuscript
versions
.
I
*NL*
incline
to
the
briefest
,
since
,
if
it
should
not
be
wholly
true
,
it
is
*NL*
at
least
likely
to
contain
the
least
falsehood
.
``
Ogg
the
son
of
*NL*
Beorl
,
''
says
my
private
hagiographer
,
``
was
a
boatman
who
gained
a
*NL*
scanty
living
by
ferrying
passengers
across
the
river
Floss
.
And
it
*NL*
came
to
pass
,
one
evening
when
the
winds
were
high
,
that
there
sat
*NL*
moaning
by
the
brink
of
the
river
a
woman
with
a
child
in
her
arms
;
*NL*
and
she
was
clad
in
rags
,
and
had
a
worn
and
withered
look
,
and
she
*NL*
craved
to
be
rowed
across
the
river
.
And
the
men
thereabout
questioned
*NL*
her
,
and
said
,
`
Wherefore
dost
thou
desire
to
cross
the
river
?
Tarry
*NL*
till
the
morning
,
and
take
shelter
here
for
the
night
;
so
shalt
thou
*NL*
be
wise
and
not
foolish
.
'
Still
she
went
on
to
mourn
and
crave
.
But
*NL*
Ogg
the
son
of
Beorl
came
up
and
said
,
'
I
will
ferry
thee
across
;
it
*NL*
is
enough
that
thy
heart
needs
it
.
'
And
he
ferried
her
across
.
And
it
*NL*
came
to
pass
,
when
she
stepped
ashore
,
that
her
rags
were
turned
into
*NL*
robes
of
flowing
white
,
and
her
face
became
bright
with
exceeding
*NL*
beauty
,
and
there
was
a
glory
around
it
,
so
that
she
shed
a
light
on
*NL*
the
water
like
the
moon
in
its
brightness
.
And
she
said
,
`
Ogg
,
the
son
*NL*
of
Beorl
,
thou
art
blessed
in
that
thou
didst
not
question
and
wrangle
*NL*
with
the
heart
's
need
,
but
wast
smitten
with
pity
,
and
didst
*NL*
straightway
relieve
the
same
.
And
from
henceforth
whoso
steps
into
thy
*NL*
boat
shall
be
in
no
peril
from
the
storm
;
and
whenever
it
puts
forth
*NL*
to
the
rescue
,
it
shall
save
the
lives
both
of
men
and
beasts
.
'
And
*NL*
when
the
floods
came
,
many
were
saved
by
reason
of
that
blessing
on
*NL*
the
boat
.
But
when
Ogg
the
son
of
Beorl
died
,
behold
,
in
the
parting
*NL*
of
his
soul
,
the
boat
loosed
itself
from
its
moorings
,
and
was
floated
*NL*
with
the
ebbing
tide
in
great
swiftness
to
the
ocean
,
and
was
seen
no
*NL*
more
.
Yet
it
was
witnessed
in
the
floods
of
aftertime
,
that
at
the
*NL*
coming
on
of
eventide
,
Ogg
the
son
of
Beorl
was
always
seen
with
his
*NL*
boat
upon
the
wide-spreading
waters
,
and
the
Blessed
Virgin
sat
in
the
*NL*
prow
,
shedding
a
light
around
as
of
the
moon
in
its
brightness
,
so
*NL*
that
the
rowers
in
the
gathering
darkness
took
heart
and
pulled
anew
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
legend
,
one
sees
,
reflects
from
a
far-off
time
the
visitation
of
*NL*
the
floods
,
which
,
even
when
they
left
human
life
untouched
,
were
*NL*
widely
fatal
to
the
helpless
cattle
,
and
swept
as
sudden
death
over
*NL*
all
smaller
living
things
.
But
the
town
knew
worse
troubles
even
than
*NL*
the
floods
,
--
troubles
of
the
civil
wars
,
when
it
was
a
continual
*NL*
fighting-place
,
where
first
Puritans
thanked
God
for
the
blood
of
the
*NL*
Loyalists
,
and
then
Loyalists
thanked
God
for
the
blood
of
the
*NL*
Puritans
.
Many
honest
citizens
lost
all
their
possessions
for
*NL*
conscience
'
sake
in
those
times
,
and
went
forth
beggared
from
their
*NL*
native
town
.
Doubtless
there
are
many
houses
standing
now
on
which
*NL*
those
honest
citizens
turned
their
backs
in
sorrow
,
--
quaint-gabled
*NL*
houses
looking
on
the
river
,
jammed
between
newer
warehouses
,
and
*NL*
penetrated
by
surprising
passages
,
which
turn
and
turn
at
sharp
angles
*NL*
till
they
lead
you
out
on
a
muddy
strand
overflowed
continually
by
the
*NL*
rushing
tide
.
Everywhere
the
brick
houses
have
a
mellow
look
,
and
in
*NL*
Mrs.
Glegg
's
day
there
was
no
incongruous
new-fashioned
smartness
,
no
*NL*
plate-glass
in
shop-windows
,
no
fresh
stucco-facing
or
other
*NL*
fallacious
attempt
to
make
fine
old
red
St.
Ogg
's
wear
the
air
of
a
*NL*
town
that
sprang
up
yesterday
.
The
shop-windows
were
small
and
*NL*
unpretending
;
for
the
farmers
'
wives
and
daughters
who
came
to
do
*NL*
their
shopping
on
market-days
were
not
to
be
withdrawn
from
their
*NL*
regular
well-known
shops
;
and
the
tradesmen
had
no
wares
intended
for
*NL*
customers
who
would
go
on
their
way
and
be
seen
no
more
.
Ah
!
even
Mrs.
*NL*
Glegg
's
day
seems
far
back
in
the
past
now
,
separated
from
us
by
*NL*
changes
that
widen
the
years
.
War
and
the
rumor
of
war
had
then
died
*NL*
out
from
the
minds
of
men
,
and
if
they
were
ever
thought
of
by
the
*NL*
farmers
in
drab
greatcoats
,
who
shook
the
grain
out
of
their
*NL*
sample-bags
and
buzzed
over
it
in
the
full
market-place
,
it
was
as
a
*NL*
state
of
things
that
belonged
to
a
past
golden
age
when
prices
were
*NL*
high
.
Surely
the
time
was
gone
forever
when
the
broad
river
could
*NL*
bring
up
unwelcome
ships
;
Russia
was
only
the
place
where
the
linseed
*NL*
came
from
,
--
the
more
the
better
,
--
making
grist
for
the
great
vertical
*NL*
millstones
with
their
scythe-like
arms
,
roaring
and
grinding
and
*NL*
carefully
sweeping
as
if
an
informing
soul
were
in
them
.
The
*NL*
Catholics
,
bad
harvests
,
and
the
mysterious
fluctuations
of
trade
were
*NL*
the
three
evils
mankind
had
to
fear
;
even
the
floods
had
not
been
*NL*
great
of
late
years
.
The
mind
of
St.
Ogg
's
did
not
look
extensively
*NL*
before
or
after
.
It
inherited
a
long
past
without
thinking
of
it
,
and
*NL*
had
no
eyes
for
the
spirits
that
walk
the
streets
.
Since
the
centuries
*NL*
when
St.
Ogg
with
his
boat
and
the
Virgin
Mother
at
the
prow
had
been
*NL*
seen
on
the
wide
water
,
so
many
memories
had
been
left
behind
,
and
had
*NL*
gradually
vanished
like
the
receding
hilltops
!
And
the
present
time
*NL*
was
like
the
level
plain
where
men
lose
their
belief
in
volcanoes
and
*NL*
earthquakes
,
thinking
to-morrow
will
be
as
yesterday
,
and
the
giant
*NL*
forces
that
used
to
shake
the
earth
are
forever
laid
to
sleep
.
The
*NL*
days
were
gone
when
people
could
be
greatly
wrought
upon
by
their
*NL*
faith
,
still
less
change
it
;
the
Catholics
were
formidable
because
*NL*
they
would
lay
hold
of
government
and
property
,
and
burn
men
alive
;
*NL*
not
because
any
sane
and
honest
parishioner
of
St.
Ogg
's
could
be
*NL*
brought
to
believe
in
the
Pope
.
One
aged
person
remembered
how
a
rude
*NL*
multitude
had
been
swayed
when
John
Wesley
preached
in
the
*NL*
cattle-market
;
but
for
a
long
while
it
had
not
been
expected
of
*NL*
preachers
that
they
should
shake
the
souls
of
men
.
An
occasional
burst
*NL*
of
fervor
in
Dissenting
pulpits
on
the
subject
of
infant
baptism
was
*NL*
the
only
symptom
of
a
zeal
unsuited
to
sober
times
when
men
had
done
*NL*
with
change
.
Protestantism
sat
at
ease
,
unmindful
of
schisms
,
careless
*NL*
of
proselytism
:
Dissent
was
an
inheritance
along
with
a
superior
pew
*NL*
and
a
business
connection
;
and
Churchmanship
only
wondered
*NL*
contemptuously
at
Dissent
as
a
foolish
habit
that
clung
greatly
to
*NL*
families
in
the
grocery
and
chandlering
lines
,
though
not
incompatible
*NL*
with
prosperous
wholesale
dealing
.
But
with
the
Catholic
Question
had
*NL*
come
a
slight
wind
of
controversy
to
break
the
calm
:
the
elderly
*NL*
rector
had
become
occasionally
historical
and
argumentative
;
and
Mr.
*NL*
Spray
,
the
Independent
minister
,
had
begun
to
preach
political
*NL*
sermons
,
in
which
he
distinguished
with
much
subtlety
between
his
*NL*
fervent
belief
in
the
right
of
the
Catholics
to
the
franchise
and
his
*NL*
fervent
belief
in
their
eternal
perdition
.
Most
of
Mr.
Spray
's
*NL*
hearers
,
however
,
were
incapable
of
following
his
subtleties
,
and
many
*NL*
old-fashioned
Dissenters
were
much
pained
by
his
``
siding
with
the
*NL*
Catholics
''
;
while
others
thought
he
had
better
let
politics
alone
.
*NL*
Public
spirit
was
not
held
in
high
esteem
at
St.
Ogg
's
,
and
men
who
*NL*
busied
themselves
with
political
questions
were
regarded
with
some
*NL*
suspicion
,
as
dangerous
characters
;
they
were
usually
persons
who
had
*NL*
little
or
no
business
of
their
own
to
manage
,
or
,
if
they
had
,
were
*NL*
likely
enough
to
become
insolvent
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
general
aspect
of
things
at
St.
Ogg
's
in
Mrs.
Glegg
's
*NL*
day
,
and
at
that
particular
period
in
her
family
history
when
she
had
*NL*
had
her
quarrel
with
Mr.
Tulliver
.
It
was
a
time
when
ignorance
was
*NL*
much
more
comfortable
than
at
present
,
and
was
received
with
all
the
*NL*
honors
in
very
good
society
,
without
being
obliged
to
dress
itself
in
*NL*
an
elaborate
costume
of
knowledge
;
a
time
when
cheap
periodicals
were
*NL*
not
,
and
when
country
surgeons
never
thought
of
asking
their
female
*NL*
patients
if
they
were
fond
of
reading
,
but
simply
took
it
for
granted
*NL*
that
they
preferred
gossip
;
a
time
when
ladies
in
rich
silk
gowns
wore
*NL*
large
pockets
,
in
which
they
carried
a
mutton-bone
to
secure
them
*NL*
against
cramp
.
Mrs.
Glegg
carried
such
a
bone
,
which
she
had
inherited
*NL*
from
her
grandmother
with
a
brocaded
gown
that
would
stand
up
empty
,
*NL*
like
a
suit
of
armor
,
and
a
silver-headed
walking-stick
;
for
the
*NL*
Dodson
family
had
been
respectable
for
many
generations
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Glegg
had
both
a
front
and
a
back
parlor
in
her
excellent
house
*NL*
at
St.
Ogg
's
,
so
that
she
had
two
points
of
view
from
which
she
could
*NL*
observe
the
weakness
of
her
fellow-beings
,
and
reinforce
her
*NL*
thankfulness
for
her
own
exceptional
strength
of
mind
.
From
her
front
*NL*
window
she
could
look
down
the
Tofton
Road
,
leading
out
of
St.
Ogg
's
,
*NL*
and
note
the
growing
tendency
to
``
gadding
about
''
in
the
wives
of
men
*NL*
not
retired
from
business
,
together
with
a
practice
of
wearing
woven
*NL*
cotton
stockings
,
which
opened
a
dreary
prospect
for
the
coming
*NL*
generation
;
and
from
her
back
windows
she
could
look
down
the
pleasant
*NL*
garden
and
orchard
which
stretched
to
the
river
,
and
observe
the
folly
*NL*
of
Mr.
Glegg
in
spending
his
time
among
``
them
flowers
and
vegetables
.
''
*NL*
For
Mr.
Glegg
,
having
retired
from
active
business
as
a
wool-stapler
*NL*
for
the
purpose
of
enjoying
himself
through
the
rest
of
his
life
,
had
*NL*
found
this
last
occupation
so
much
more
severe
than
his
business
,
that
*NL*
he
had
been
driven
into
amateur
hard
labor
as
a
dissipation
,
and
*NL*
habitually
relaxed
by
doing
the
work
of
two
ordinary
gardeners
.
The
*NL*
economizing
of
a
gardener
's
wages
might
perhaps
have
induced
Mrs.
*NL*
Glegg
to
wink
at
this
folly
,
if
it
were
possible
for
a
healthy
female
*NL*
mind
even
to
simulate
respect
for
a
husband
's
hobby
.
But
it
is
well
*NL*
known
that
this
conjugal
complacency
belongs
only
to
the
weaker
*NL*
portion
of
the
sex
,
who
are
scarcely
alive
to
the
responsibilities
of
*NL*
a
wife
as
a
constituted
check
on
her
husband
's
pleasures
,
which
are
*NL*
hardly
ever
of
a
rational
or
commendable
kind
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Glegg
on
his
side
,
too
,
had
a
double
source
of
mental
occupation
,
*NL*
which
gave
every
promise
of
being
inexhaustible
.
On
the
one
hand
,
he
*NL*
surprised
himself
by
his
discoveries
in
natural
history
,
finding
that
*NL*
his
piece
of
garden-ground
contained
wonderful
caterpillars
,
slugs
,
*NL*
and
insects
,
which
,
so
far
as
he
had
heard
,
had
never
before
attracted
*NL*
human
observation
;
and
he
noticed
remarkable
coincidences
between
*NL*
these
zoological
phenomena
and
the
great
events
of
that
time
,
--
as
,
for
*NL*
example
,
that
before
the
burning
of
York
Minster
there
had
been
*NL*
mysterious
serpentine
marks
on
the
leaves
of
the
rose-trees
,
together
*NL*
with
an
unusual
prevalence
of
slugs
,
which
he
had
been
puzzled
to
know
*NL*
the
meaning
of
,
until
it
flashed
upon
him
with
this
melancholy
*NL*
conflagration
.
-LRB-
Mr.
Glegg
had
an
unusual
amount
of
mental
activity
,
*NL*
which
,
when
disengaged
from
the
wool
business
,
naturally
made
itself
a
*NL*
pathway
in
other
directions
.
-RRB-
And
his
second
subject
of
meditation
was
*NL*
the
``
contrairiness
''
of
the
female
mind
,
as
typically
exhibited
in
Mrs.
*NL*
Glegg
.
That
a
creature
made
--
in
a
genealogical
sense
--
out
of
a
man
's
*NL*
rib
,
and
in
this
particular
case
maintained
in
the
highest
*NL*
respectability
without
any
trouble
of
her
own
,
should
be
normally
in
a
*NL*
state
of
contradiction
to
the
blandest
propositions
and
even
to
the
*NL*
most
accommodating
concessions
,
was
a
mystery
in
the
scheme
of
things
*NL*
to
which
he
had
often
in
vain
sought
a
clew
in
the
early
chapters
of
*NL*
Genesis
.
Mr.
Glegg
had
chosen
the
eldest
Miss
Dodson
as
a
handsome
*NL*
embodiment
of
female
prudence
and
thrift
,
and
being
himself
of
a
*NL*
money-getting
,
money-keeping
turn
,
had
calculated
on
much
conjugal
*NL*
harmony
.
But
in
that
curious
compound
,
the
feminine
character
,
it
may
*NL*
easily
happen
that
the
flavor
is
unpleasant
in
spite
of
excellent
*NL*
ingredients
;
and
a
fine
systematic
stinginess
may
be
accompanied
with
*NL*
a
seasoning
that
quite
spoils
its
relish
.
Now
,
good
Mr.
Glegg
himself
*NL*
was
stingy
in
the
most
amiable
manner
;
his
neighbors
called
him
*NL*
``
near
,
''
which
always
means
that
the
person
in
question
is
a
lovable
*NL*
skinflint
.
If
you
expressed
a
preference
for
cheese-parings
,
Mr.
Glegg
*NL*
would
remember
to
save
them
for
you
,
with
a
good-natured
delight
in
*NL*
gratifying
your
palate
,
and
he
was
given
to
pet
all
animals
which
*NL*
required
no
appreciable
keep
.
There
was
no
humbug
or
hypocrisy
about
*NL*
Mr.
Glegg
;
his
eyes
would
have
watered
with
true
feeling
over
the
sale
*NL*
of
a
widow
's
furniture
,
which
a
five-pound
note
from
his
side
pocket
*NL*
would
have
prevented
;
but
a
donation
of
five
pounds
to
a
person
``
in
a
*NL*
small
way
of
life
''
would
have
seemed
to
him
a
mad
kind
of
lavishness
*NL*
rather
than
``
charity
,
''
which
had
always
presented
itself
to
him
as
a
*NL*
contribution
of
small
aids
,
not
a
neutralizing
of
misfortune
.
And
Mr.
*NL*
Glegg
was
just
as
fond
of
saving
other
people
's
money
as
his
own
;
he
*NL*
would
have
ridden
as
far
round
to
avoid
a
turnpike
when
his
expenses
*NL*
were
to
be
paid
for
him
,
as
when
they
were
to
come
out
of
his
own
*NL*
pocket
,
and
was
quite
zealous
in
trying
to
induce
indifferent
*NL*
acquaintances
to
adopt
a
cheap
substitute
for
blacking
.
This
*NL*
inalienable
habit
of
saving
,
as
an
end
in
itself
,
belonged
to
the
*NL*
industrious
men
of
business
of
a
former
generation
,
who
made
their
*NL*
fortunes
slowly
,
almost
as
the
tracking
of
the
fox
belongs
to
the
*NL*
harrier
,
--
it
constituted
them
a
``
race
,
''
which
is
nearly
lost
in
these
*NL*
days
of
rapid
money-getting
,
when
lavishness
comes
close
on
the
back
*NL*
of
want
.
In
old-fashioned
times
an
``
independence
''
was
hardly
ever
made
*NL*
without
a
little
miserliness
as
a
condition
,
and
you
would
have
found
*NL*
that
quality
in
every
provincial
district
,
combined
with
characters
as
*NL*
various
as
the
fruits
from
which
we
can
extract
acid
.
The
true
*NL*
Harpagons
were
always
marked
and
exceptional
characters
;
not
so
the
*NL*
worthy
tax-payers
,
who
,
having
once
pinched
from
real
necessity
,
*NL*
retained
even
in
the
midst
of
their
comfortable
retirement
,
with
their
*NL*
wallfruit
and
wine-bins
,
the
habit
of
regarding
life
as
an
ingenious
*NL*
process
of
nibbling
out
one
's
livelihood
without
leaving
any
*NL*
perceptible
deficit
,
and
who
would
have
been
as
immediately
prompted
*NL*
to
give
up
a
newly
taxed
luxury
when
they
had
had
their
clear
five
*NL*
hundred
a
year
,
as
when
they
had
only
five
hundred
pounds
of
capital
.
*NL*
Mr.
Glegg
was
one
of
these
men
,
found
so
impracticable
by
chancellors
*NL*
of
the
exchequer
;
and
knowing
this
,
you
will
be
the
better
able
to
*NL*
understand
why
he
had
not
swerved
from
the
conviction
that
he
had
made
*NL*
an
eligible
marriage
,
in
spite
of
the
too-pungent
seasoning
that
*NL*
nature
had
given
to
the
eldest
Miss
Dodson
's
virtues
.
A
man
with
an
*NL*
affectionate
disposition
,
who
finds
a
wife
to
concur
with
his
*NL*
fundamental
idea
of
life
,
easily
comes
to
persuade
himself
that
no
*NL*
other
woman
would
have
suited
him
so
well
,
and
does
a
little
daily
*NL*
snapping
and
quarrelling
without
any
sense
of
alienation
.
Mr.
Glegg
,
*NL*
being
of
a
reflective
turn
,
and
no
longer
occupied
with
wool
,
had
much
*NL*
wondering
meditation
on
the
peculiar
constitution
of
the
female
mind
*NL*
as
unfolded
to
him
in
his
domestic
life
;
and
yet
he
thought
Mrs.
*NL*
Glegg
's
household
ways
a
model
for
her
sex
.
It
struck
him
as
a
*NL*
pitiable
irregularity
in
other
women
if
they
did
not
roll
up
their
*NL*
table-napkins
with
the
same
tightness
and
emphasis
as
Mrs.
Glegg
did
,
*NL*
if
their
pastry
had
a
less
leathery
consistence
,
and
their
damson
*NL*
cheese
a
less
venerable
hardness
than
hers
;
nay
,
even
the
peculiar
*NL*
combination
of
grocery
and
druglike
odors
in
Mrs.
Glegg
's
private
*NL*
cupboard
impressed
him
as
the
only
right
thing
in
the
way
of
cupboard
*NL*
smells
.
I
am
not
sure
that
he
would
not
have
longed
for
the
*NL*
quarrelling
again
,
if
it
had
ceased
for
an
entire
week
;
and
it
is
*NL*
certain
that
an
acquiescent
,
mild
wife
would
have
left
his
meditations
*NL*
comparatively
jejune
and
barren
of
mystery
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Glegg
's
unmistakable
kind-heartedness
was
shown
in
this
,
that
it
*NL*
pained
him
more
to
see
his
wife
at
variance
with
others
,
--
even
with
*NL*
Dolly
,
the
servant
,
--
than
to
be
in
a
state
of
cavil
with
her
himself
;
*NL*
and
the
quarrel
between
her
and
Mr.
Tulliver
vexed
him
so
much
that
it
*NL*
quite
nullified
the
pleasure
he
would
otherwise
have
had
in
the
state
*NL*
of
his
early
cabbages
,
as
he
walked
in
his
garden
before
breakfast
the
*NL*
next
morning
.
Still
,
he
went
in
to
breakfast
with
some
slight
hope
*NL*
that
,
now
Mrs.
Glegg
had
``
slept
upon
it
,
''
her
anger
might
be
subdued
*NL*
enough
to
give
way
to
her
usually
strong
sense
of
family
decorum
.
She
*NL*
had
been
used
to
boast
that
there
had
never
been
any
of
those
deadly
*NL*
quarrels
among
the
Dodsons
which
had
disgraced
other
families
;
that
no
*NL*
Dodson
had
ever
been
``
cut
off
with
a
shilling
,
''
and
no
cousin
of
the
*NL*
Dodsons
disowned
;
as
,
indeed
,
why
should
they
be
?
For
they
had
no
*NL*
cousins
who
had
not
money
out
at
use
,
or
some
houses
of
their
own
,
at
*NL*
the
very
least
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
one
evening-cloud
which
had
always
disappeared
from
Mrs.
*NL*
Glegg
's
brow
when
she
sat
at
the
breakfast-table
.
It
was
her
fuzzy
*NL*
front
of
curls
;
for
as
she
occupied
herself
in
household
matters
in
*NL*
the
morning
it
would
have
been
a
mere
extravagance
to
put
on
anything
*NL*
so
superfluous
to
the
making
of
leathery
pastry
as
a
fuzzy
curled
*NL*
front
.
By
half-past
ten
decorum
demanded
the
front
;
until
then
Mrs.
*NL*
Glegg
could
economize
it
,
and
society
would
never
be
any
the
wiser
.
*NL*
But
the
absence
of
that
cloud
only
left
it
more
apparent
that
the
*NL*
cloud
of
severity
remained
;
and
Mr.
Glegg
,
perceiving
this
,
as
he
sat
*NL*
down
to
his
milkporridge
,
which
it
was
his
old
frugal
habit
to
stem
*NL*
his
morning
hunger
with
,
prudently
resolved
to
leave
the
first
remark
*NL*
to
Mrs.
Glegg
,
lest
,
to
so
delicate
an
article
as
a
lady
's
temper
,
the
*NL*
slightest
touch
should
do
mischief
.
People
who
seem
to
enjoy
their
ill
*NL*
temper
have
a
way
of
keeping
it
in
fine
condition
by
inflicting
*NL*
privations
on
themselves
.
That
was
Mrs.
Glegg
's
way
.
She
made
her
tea
*NL*
weaker
than
usual
this
morning
,
and
declined
butter
.
It
was
a
hard
*NL*
case
that
a
vigorous
mood
for
quarrelling
,
so
highly
capable
of
using
*NL*
an
opportunity
,
should
not
meet
with
a
single
remark
from
Mr.
Glegg
on
*NL*
which
to
exercise
itself
.
But
by
and
by
it
appeared
that
his
silence
*NL*
would
answer
the
purpose
,
for
he
heard
himself
apostrophized
at
last
*NL*
in
that
tone
peculiar
to
the
wife
of
one
's
bosom
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Mr.
Glegg
!
it
's
a
poor
return
I
get
for
making
you
the
wife
*NL*
I
've
made
you
all
these
years
.
If
this
is
the
way
I
'm
to
be
treated
,
*NL*
I
'd
better
ha
'
known
it
before
my
poor
father
died
,
and
then
,
when
I
'd
*NL*
wanted
a
home
,
I
should
ha
'
gone
elsewhere
,
as
the
choice
was
offered
*NL*
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Glegg
paused
from
his
porridge
and
looked
up
,
not
with
any
new
*NL*
amazement
,
but
simply
with
that
quiet
,
habitual
wonder
with
which
we
*NL*
regard
constant
mysteries
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
Mrs.
G.
,
what
have
I
done
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Done
now
,
Mr.
Glegg
?
_
done
now
?
_
--
I
'm
sorry
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Not
seeing
his
way
to
any
pertinent
answer
,
Mr.
Glegg
reverted
to
his
*NL*
porridge
.
*NL*

Perhaps
I

wrong
and
you
can

teach
me
better

But
I
've
allays
heard
as
it

the

rather

he
was

come

*NL*
``

Mr.

said

Mrs.

in

*NL*
``
Yes

Mr.

sharply

``
The

*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.

felt
there
was
really
something
in
this
,
but
she
tossed
her
*NL*
head
and
emitted
a
guttural
interjection
to
indicate
that
her
silence
*NL*
was
only
an
armistice

not
a

And
,
in

hostilities
soon

broke
out
again

*NL*
``

Mr.

seeing
that
she

when
he

She
lifted
the

with
a
slight
toss
of

-LRB-
These

words
were
uttered
in
a
tone

of
sorrowful

Mr.

pushed
his

from
him

tapped

the

with
both
his

-RRB-

said
Mrs.

''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
Mrs.
Glegg
's
voice
intimated
that
she
was
going
to
cry
,
and
*NL*
breaking
off
from
speech
,
she
rang
the
bell
violently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sally
,
''
she
said
,
rising
from
her
chair
,
and
speaking
in
rather
a
*NL*
choked
voice
,
``
light
a
fire
up-stairs

and
put
the

Mr.
*NL*
Glegg
,
you
'll

what
you

for

I
shall
have
*NL*
gruel

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Glegg
walked
across
the
room
to
the
small
book-case
,
and
took
*NL*
down
Baxter
's
``
Saints
'
Everlasting
Rest
,
''
which
she
carried
with
her
*NL*
up-stairs
.
It
was
the
book
she
was
accustomed
to
lay
open
before
her
*NL*
on
special
occasions
,
--
on
wet
Sunday
mornings
,
or
when
she
heard
of
a
*NL*
death
in
the
family
,
or
when
,
as
in
this
case
,
her
quarrel
with
Mr.
*NL*
Glegg
had
been
set
an
octave
higher
than
usual
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Mrs.
Glegg
carried
something
else
up-stairs
with
her
,
which
,
*NL*
together
with
the
``
Saints
'
Rest
''
and
the
gruel
,
may
have
had
some
*NL*
influence
in
gradually
calming
her
feelings
,
and
making
it
possible
*NL*
for
her
to
endure
existence
on
the
ground-floor
,
shortly
before
*NL*
tea-time
.
This
was
,
partly
,
Mr.
Glegg
's
suggestion
that
she
would
do
*NL*
well
to
let
her
five
hundred
lie
still
until
a
good
investment
turned
*NL*
up
;
and
,
further
,
his
parenthetic
hint
at
his
handsome
provision
for
*NL*
her
in
case
of
his
death
.
Mr.
Glegg
,
like
all
men
of
his
stamp
,
was
*NL*
extremely
reticent
about
his
will
;
and
Mrs.
Glegg
,
in
her
gloomier
*NL*
moments
,
had
forebodings
that
,
like
other
husbands
of
whom
she
had
*NL*
heard
,
he
might
cherish
the
mean
project
of
heightening
her
grief
at
*NL*
his
death
by
leaving
her
poorly
off
,
in
which
case
she
was
firmly
*NL*
resolved
that
she
would
have
scarcely
any
weeper
on
her
bonnet
,
and
*NL*
would
cry
no
more
than
if
he
had
been
a
second
husband
.
But
if
he
had
*NL*
really
shown
her
any
testamentary
tenderness
,
it
would
be
affecting
to
*NL*
think
of
him
,
poor
man
,
when
he
was
gone
;
and
even
his
foolish
fuss
*NL*
about
the
flowers
and
garden-stuff
,
and
his
insistence
on
the
subject
*NL*
of
snails
,
would
be
touching
when
it
was
once
fairly
at
an
end
.
To
*NL*
survive
Mr.
Glegg
,
and
talk
eulogistically
of
him
as
a
man
who
might
*NL*
have
his
weaknesses
,
but
who
had
done
the
right
thing
by
her
,
*NL*
not-withstanding
his
numerous
poor
relations
;
to
have
sums
of
interest
*NL*
coming
in
more
frequently
,
and
secrete
it
in
various
corners
,
baffling
*NL*
to
the
most
ingenious
of
thieves
-LRB-
for
,
to
Mrs.
Glegg
's
mind
,
banks
and
*NL*
strong-boxes
would
have
nullified
the
pleasure
of
property
;
she
might
*NL*
as
well
have
taken
her
food
in
capsules
-RRB-
;
finally
,
to
be
looked
up
to
*NL*
by
her
own
family
and
the
neighborhood
,
so
as
no
woman
can
ever
hope
*NL*
to
be
who
has
not
the
praeterite
and
present
dignity
comprised
in
being
*NL*
a
``
widow
well
left
,
''
--
all
this
made
a
flattering
and
conciliatory
view
*NL*
of
the
future
.
So
that
when
good
Mr.
Glegg
,
restored
to
good
humor
by
*NL*
much
hoeing
,
and
moved
by
the
sight
of
his
wife
's
empty
chair
,
with
*NL*
her
knitting
rolled
up
in
the
corner
,
went
up-stairs
to
her
,
and
*NL*
observed
that
the
bell
had
been
tolling
for
poor
Mr.
Morton
,
Mrs.
*NL*
Glegg
answered
magnanimously
,
quite
as
if
she
had
been
an
uninjured
*NL*
woman
:
``
Ah
!
then
,
there
'll
be
a
good
business
for
somebody
to
take
*NL*
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Baxter
had
been
open
at
least
eight
hours
by
this
time
,
for
it
was
*NL*
nearly
five
o'clock
;
and
if
people
are
to
quarrel
often
,
it
follows
as
*NL*
a
corollary
that
their
quarrels
can
not
be
protracted
beyond
certain
*NL*
limits
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Glegg
talked
quite
amicably
about
the
Tullivers
that
*NL*
evening
.
Mr.
Glegg
went
the
length
of
admitting
that
Tulliver
was
a
*NL*
sad
man
for
getting
into
hot
water
,
and
was
like
enough
to
run
through
*NL*
his
property
;
and
Mrs.
Glegg
,
meeting
this
acknowledgment
half-way
,
*NL*
declared
that
it
was
beneath
her
to
take
notice
of
such
a
man
's
*NL*
conduct
,
and
that
,
for
her
sister
's
sake
,
she
would
let
him
keep
the
*NL*
five
hundred
a
while
longer
,
for
when
she
put
it
out
on
a
mortgage
she
*NL*
should
only
get
four
per
cent
.

Mr.

Further
Entangles
the
Skein

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Owing
to
this
new
adjustment
of
Mrs.
Glegg
's
thoughts
,
Mrs.
Pullet
*NL*
found
her
task
of
mediation
the
next
day
surprisingly
easy
.
Mrs.
*NL*
Glegg
,
indeed
checked
her
rather
sharply
for
thinking
it
would
be
*NL*
necessary
to
tell
her
elder
sister
what
was
the
right
mode
of
behavior
*NL*
in
family
matters
.
Mrs.
Pullet
's
argument
,
that
it
would
look
ill
in
*NL*
the
neighborhood
if
people
should
have
it
in
their
power
to
say
that
*NL*
there
was
a
quarrel
in
the
family
,
was
particularly
offensive
.
If
the
*NL*
family
name
never
suffered
except
through
Mrs.
Glegg
,
Mrs.
Pullet
*NL*
might
lay
her
head
on
her
pillow
in
perfect
confidence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
not
to
be
expected
,
I
suppose
,
''
observed
Mrs.
Glegg
,
by
way
of
*NL*
winding
up
the
subject
,
``
as
I
shall
go
to
the
mill
again
before
Bessy
*NL*
comes
to
see
me
,
or
as
I
shall
go
and
fall
down
o
'
my
knees
to
Mr.
*NL*
Tulliver
,
and
ask
his
pardon
for
showing
him
favors
;
but
I
shall
bear
*NL*
no
malice
,
and
when
Mr.
Tulliver
speaks
civil
to
me
,
I
'll
speak
civil
*NL*
to
him
.
Nobody
has
any
call
to
tell
me
what
's
becoming
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Finding
it
unnecessary
to
plead
for
the
Tullivers
,
it
was
natural
that
*NL*
aunt
Pullet
should
relax
a
little
in
her
anxiety
for
them
,
and
recur
*NL*
to
the
annoyance
she
had
suffered
yesterday
from
the
offspring
of
that
*NL*
apparently
ill-fated
house
.
Mrs.
Glegg
heard
a
circumstantial
*NL*
narrative
,
to
which
Mr.
Pullet
's
remarkable
memory
furnished
some
*NL*
items
;
and
while
aunt
Pullet
pitied
poor
Bessy
's
bad
luck
with
her
*NL*
children
,
and
expressed
a
half-formed
project
of
paying
for
Maggie
's
*NL*
being
sent
to
a
distant
boarding-school
,
which
would
not
prevent
her
*NL*
being
so
brown
,
but
might
tend
to
subdue
some
other
vices
in
her
,
aunt
*NL*
Glegg
blamed
Bessy
for
her
weakness
,
and
appealed
to
all
witnesses
who
*NL*
should
be
living
when
the
Tulliver
children
had
turned
out
ill
,
that
*NL*
she
,
Mrs.
Glegg
,
had
always
said
how
it
would
be
from
the
very
first
,
*NL*
observing
that
it
was
wonderful
to
herself
how
all
her
words
came
*NL*
true
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
may
call
and
tell
Bessy
you
'll
bear
no
malice
,
and
everything
*NL*
be
as
it
was
before
?
''
Mrs.
Pullet
said
,
just
before
parting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
you
may
,
Sophy
,
''
said
Mrs.
Glegg
;
``
you
may
tell
Mr.
Tulliver
,
*NL*
and
Bessy
too
,
as
I
'm
not
going
to
behave
ill
because
folks
behave
ill
*NL*
to
me
;
I
know
it
's
my
place
,
as
the
eldest
,
to
set
an
example
in
every
*NL*
respect
,
and
I
do
it
.
Nobody
can
say
different
of
me
,
if
they
'll
keep
*NL*
to
the
truth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Glegg
being
in
this
state
of
satisfaction
in
her
own
lofty
*NL*
magnanimity
,
I
leave
you
to
judge
what
effect
was
produced
on
her
by
*NL*
the
reception
of
a
short
letter
from
Mr.
Tulliver
that
very
evening
,
*NL*
after
Mrs.
Pullet
's
departure
,
informing
her
that
she
need
n't
trouble
*NL*
her
mind
about
her
five
hundred
pounds
,
for
it
should
be
paid
back
to
*NL*
her
in
the
course
of
the
next
month
at
farthest
,
together
with
the
*NL*
interest
due
thereon
until
the
time
of
payment
.
And
furthermore
,
that
*NL*
Mr.
Tulliver
had
no
wish
to
behave
uncivilly
to
Mrs.
Glegg
,
and
she
*NL*
was
welcome
to
his
house
whenever
she
liked
to
come
,
but
he
desired
no
*NL*
favors
from
her
,
either
for
himself
or
his
children
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
poor
Mrs.
Tulliver
who
had
hastened
this
catastrophe
,
entirely
*NL*
through
that
irrepressible
hopefulness
of
hers
which
led
her
to
expect
*NL*
that
similar
causes
may
at
any
time
produce
different
results
.
It
had
*NL*
very
often
occurred
in
her
experience
that
Mr.
Tulliver
had
done
*NL*
something
because
other
people
had
said
he
was
not
able
to
do
it
,
or
*NL*
had
pitied
him
for
his
supposed
inability
,
or
in
any
other
way
piqued
*NL*
his
pride
;
still
,
she
thought
to-day
,
if
she
told
him
when
he
came
in
*NL*
to
tea
that
sister
Pullet
was
gone
to
try
and
make
everything
up
with
*NL*
sister
Glegg
,
so
that
he
need
n't
think
about
paying
in
the
money
,
it
*NL*
would
give
a
cheerful
effect
to
the
meal
.
Mr.
Tulliver
had
never
*NL*
slackened
in
his
resolve
to
raise
the
money
,
but
now
he
at
once
*NL*
determined
to
write
a
letter
to
Mrs.
Glegg
,
which
should
cut
off
all
*NL*
possibility
of
mistake
.
Mrs.
Pullet
gone
to
beg
and
pray
for
_
him
_
*NL*
indeed
!
Mr.
Tulliver
did
not
willingly
write
a
letter
,
and
found
the
*NL*
relation
between
spoken
and
written
language
,
briefly
known
as
*NL*
spelling
,
one
of
the
most
puzzling
things
in
this
puzzling
world
.
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
like
all
fervid
writing
,
the
task
was
done
in
less
time
*NL*
than
usual
,
and
if
the
spelling
differed
from
Mrs.
Glegg
's
,
--
why
,
she
*NL*
belonged
,
like
himself
,
to
a
generation
with
whom
spelling
was
a
*NL*
matter
of
private
judgment
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Glegg
did
not
alter
her
will
in
consequence
of
this
letter
,
and
*NL*
cut
off
the
Tulliver
children
from
their
sixth
and
seventh
share
in
*NL*
her
thousand
pounds
;
for
she
had
her
principles
.
No
one
must
be
able
*NL*
to
say
of
her
when
she
was
dead
that
she
had
not
divided
her
money
*NL*
with
perfect
fairness
among
her
own
kin
.
In
the
matter
of
wills
,
*NL*
personal
qualities
were
subordinate
to
the
great
fundamental
fact
of
*NL*
blood
;
and
to
be
determined
in
the
distribution
of
your
property
by
*NL*
caprice
,
and
not
make
your
legacies
bear
a
direct
ratio
to
degrees
of
*NL*
kinship
,
was
a
prospective
disgrace
that
would
have
embittered
her
*NL*
life
.
This
had
always
been
a
principle
in
the
Dodson
family
;
it
was
*NL*
one
form
if
that
sense
of
honor
and
rectitude
which
was
a
proud
*NL*
tradition
in
such
families
,
--
a
tradition
which
has
been
the
salt
of
*NL*
our
provincial
society
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
though
the
letter
could
not
shake
Mrs.
Glegg
's
principles
,
it
made
*NL*
the
family
breach
much
more
difficult
to
mend
;
and
as
to
the
effect
it
*NL*
produced
on
Mrs.
Glegg
's
opinion
of
Mr.
Tulliver
,
she
begged
to
be
*NL*
understood
from
that
time
forth
that
she
had
nothing
whatever
to
say
*NL*
about
him
;
his
state
of
mind
,
apparently
,
was
too
corrupt
for
her
to
*NL*
contemplate
it
for
a
moment
.
It
was
not
until
the
evening
before
Tom
*NL*
went
to
school
,
at
the
beginning
of
August
,
that
Mrs.
Glegg
paid
a
*NL*
visit
to
her
sister
Tulliver
,
sitting
in
her
gig
all
the
while
,
and
*NL*
showing
her
displeasure
by
markedly
abstaining
from
all
advice
and
*NL*
criticism
;
for
,
as
she
observed
to
her
sister
Deane
,
``
Bessy
must
bear
*NL*
the
consequence
o
'
having
such
a
husband
,
though
I
'm
sorry
for
her
,
''
*NL*
and
Mrs.
Deane
agreed
that
Bessy
was
pitiable
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
evening
Tom
observed
to
Maggie
:
``
Oh
my
!
Maggie
,
aunt
Glegg
's
*NL*
beginning
to
come
again
;
I
'm
glad
I
'm
going
to
school
.
_
You
'll
_
catch
*NL*
it
all
now
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
was
already
so
full
of
sorrow
at
the
thought
of
Tom
's
going
*NL*
away
from
her
,
that
this
playful
exultation
of
his
seemed
very
unkind
,
*NL*
and
she
cried
herself
to
sleep
that
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Tulliver
's
prompt
procedure
entailed
on
him
further
promptitude
in
*NL*
finding
the
convenient
person
who
was
desirous
of
lending
five
hundred
*NL*
pounds
on
bond
.
``
It
must
be
no
client
of
Wakem
's
,
''
he
said
to
himself
;
*NL*
and
yet
at
the
end
of
a
fortnight
it
turned
out
to
the
contrary
;
not
*NL*
because
Mr.
Tulliver
's
will
was
feeble
,
but
because
external
fact
was
*NL*
stronger
.
Wakem
's
client
was
the
only
convenient
person
to
be
found
.
*NL*
Mr.
Tulliver
had
a
destiny
as
well
as
OEdipus
,
and
in
this
case
*NL*
he
might
plead
,
like
OEdipus
,
that
his
deed
was
inflicted
on
him
*NL*
rather
than
committed
by
him
.

Tom
's
``
First

''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
Tulliver
's
sufferings
during
the
first
quarter
he
was
at
King
's
*NL*
Lorton
,
under
the
distinguished
care
of
the
Rev.
Walter
Stelling
,
were
*NL*
rather
severe
.
At
Mr.
Jacob
's
academy
life
had
not
presented
itself
to
*NL*
him
as
a
difficult
problem
;
there
were
plenty
of
fellows
to
play
with
,
*NL*
and
Tom
being
good
at
all
active
games
,
--
fighting
especially
,
--
had
*NL*
that
precedence
among
them
which
appeared
to
him
inseparable
from
the
*NL*
personality
of
Tom
Tulliver
.
Mr.
Jacobs
himself
,
familiarly
known
as
*NL*
Old
Goggles
,
from
his
habit
of
wearing
spectacles
,
imposed
no
painful
*NL*
awe
;
and
if
it
was
the
property
of
snuffy
old
hypocrites
like
him
to
*NL*
write
like
copperplate
and
surround
their
signatures
with
arabesques
,
*NL*
to
spell
without
forethought
,
and
to
spout
``
my
name
is
Norval
''
without
*NL*
bungling
,
Tom
,
for
his
part
,
was
glad
he
was
not
in
danger
of
those
*NL*
mean
accomplishments
.
He
was
not
going
to
be
a
snuffy
schoolmaster
,
*NL*
he
,
but
a
substantial
man
,
like
his
father
,
who
used
to
go
hunting
*NL*
when
he
was
younger
,
and
rode
a
capital
black
mare
,
--
as
pretty
a
bit
*NL*
of
horse-flesh
as
ever
you
saw
;
Tom
had
heard
what
her
points
were
a
*NL*
hundred
times
.
_
He
_
meant
to
go
hunting
too
,
and
to
be
generally
*NL*
respected
.
When
people
were
grown
up
,
he
considered
,
nobody
inquired
*NL*
about
their
writing
and
spelling
;
when
he
was
a
man
,
he
should
be
*NL*
master
of
everything
,
and
do
just
as
he
liked
.
It
had
been
very
*NL*
difficult
for
him
to
reconcile
himself
to
the
idea
that
his
*NL*
school-time
was
to
be
prolonged
and
that
he
was
not
to
be
brought
up
*NL*
to
his
father
's
business
,
which
he
had
always
thought
extremely
*NL*
pleasant
;
for
it
was
nothing
but
riding
about
,
giving
orders
,
and
*NL*
going
to
market
;
and
he
thought
that
a
clergyman
would
give
him
a
*NL*
great
many
Scripture
lessons
,
and
probably
make
him
learn
the
Gospel
*NL*
and
Epistle
on
a
Sunday
,
as
well
as
the
Collect
.
But
in
the
absence
of
*NL*
specific
information
,
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
imagine
that
school
*NL*
and
a
schoolmaster
would
be
something
entirely
different
from
the
*NL*
academy
of
Mr.
Jacobs
.
So
,
not
to
be
at
a
deficiency
,
in
case
of
his
*NL*
finding
genial
companions
,
he
had
taken
care
to
carry
with
him
a
small
*NL*
box
of
percussion-caps
;
not
that
there
was
anything
particular
to
be
*NL*
done
with
them
,
but
they
would
serve
to
impress
strange
boys
with
a
*NL*
sense
of
his
familiarity
with
guns
.
Thus
poor
Tom
,
though
he
saw
very
*NL*
clearly
through
Maggie
's
illusions
,
was
not
without
illusions
of
his
*NL*
own
,
which
were
to
be
cruelly
dissipated
by
his
enlarged
experience
at
*NL*
King
's
Lorton
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
not
been
there
a
fortnight
before
it
was
evident
to
him
that
*NL*
life
,
complicated
not
only
with
the
Latin
grammar
but
with
a
new
*NL*
standard
of
English
pronunciation
,
was
a
very
difficult
business
,
made
*NL*
all
the
more
obscure
by
a
thick
mist
of
bashfulness
.
Tom
,
as
you
have
*NL*
observed
,
was
never
an
exception
among
boys
for
ease
of
address
;
but
*NL*
the
difficulty
of
enunciating
a
monosyllable
in
reply
to
Mr.
or
Mrs.
*NL*
Stelling
was
so
great
,
that
he
even
dreaded
to
be
asked
at
table
*NL*
whether
he
would
have
more
pudding
.
As
to
the
percussion-caps
,
he
had
*NL*
almost
resolved
,
in
the
bitterness
of
his
heart
,
that
he
would
throw
*NL*
them
into
a
neighboring
pond
;
for
not
only
was
he
the
solitary
pupil
,
*NL*
but
he
began
even
to
have
a
certain
scepticism
about
guns
,
and
a
*NL*
general
sense
that
his
theory
of
life
was
undermined
.
For
Mr.
Stelling
*NL*
thought
nothing
of
guns
,
or
horses
either
,
apparently
;
and
yet
it
was
*NL*
impossible
for
Tom
to
despise
Mr.
Stelling
as
he
had
despised
Old
*NL*
Goggles
.
If
there
were
anything
that
was
not
thoroughly
genuine
about
*NL*
Mr.
Stelling
,
it
lay
quite
beyond
Tom
's
power
to
detect
it
;
it
is
only
*NL*
by
a
wide
comparison
of
facts
that
the
wisest
full-grown
man
can
*NL*
distinguish
well-rolled
barrels
from
mere
supernal
thunder
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Stelling
was
a
well-sized
,
broad-chested
man
,
not
yet
thirty
,
with
*NL*
flaxen
hair
standing
erect
,
and
large
lightish-gray
eyes
,
which
were
*NL*
always
very
wide
open
;
he
had
a
sonorous
bass
voice
,
and
an
air
of
*NL*
defiant
self-confidence
inclining
to
brazenness
.
He
had
entered
on
his
*NL*
career
with
great
vigor
,
and
intended
to
make
a
considerable
*NL*
impression
on
his
fellowmen
.
The
Rev.
Walter
Stelling
was
not
a
man
*NL*
who
would
remain
among
the
``
inferior
clergy
''
all
his
life
.
He
had
a
*NL*
true
British
determination
to
push
his
way
in
the
world
,
--
as
a
*NL*
schoolmaster
,
in
the
first
place
,
for
there
were
capital
masterships
*NL*
of
grammar-schools
to
be
had
,
and
Mr.
Stelling
meant
to
have
one
of
*NL*
them
;
but
as
a
preacher
also
,
for
he
meant
always
to
preach
in
a
*NL*
striking
manner
,
so
as
to
have
his
congregation
swelled
by
admirers
*NL*
from
neighboring
parishes
,
and
to
produce
a
great
sensation
whenever
*NL*
he
took
occasional
duty
for
a
brother
clergyman
of
minor
gifts
.
The
*NL*
style
of
preaching
he
had
chosen
was
the
extemporaneous
,
which
was
*NL*
held
little
short
of
the
miraculous
in
rural
parishes
like
King
's
*NL*
Lorton
.
Some
passages
of
Massillon
and
Bourdaloue
,
which
he
knew
by
*NL*
heart
,
were
really
very
effective
when
rolled
out
in
Mr.
Stelling
's
*NL*
deepest
tones
;
but
as
comparatively
feeble
appeals
of
his
own
were
*NL*
delivered
in
the
same
loud
and
impressive
manner
,
they
were
often
*NL*
thought
quite
as
striking
by
his
hearers
.
Mr.
Stelling
's
doctrine
was
*NL*
of
no
particular
school
;
if
anything
,
it
had
a
tinge
of
*NL*
evangelicalism
,
for
that
was
``
the
telling
thing
''
just
then
in
the
*NL*
diocese
to
which
King
's
Lorton
belonged
.
In
short
,
Mr.
Stelling
was
a
*NL*
man
who
meant
to
rise
in
his
profession
,
and
to
rise
by
merit
,
*NL*
clearly
,
since
he
had
no
interest
beyond
what
might
be
promised
by
a
*NL*
problematic
relationship
to
a
great
lawyer
who
had
not
yet
become
Lord
*NL*
Chancellor
.
A
clergyman
who
has
such
vigorous
intentions
naturally
*NL*
gets
a
little
into
debt
at
starting
;
it
is
not
to
be
expected
that
he
*NL*
will
live
in
the
meagre
style
of
a
man
who
means
to
be
a
poor
curate
*NL*
all
his
life
;
and
if
the
few
hundreds
Mr.
Timpson
advanced
toward
his
*NL*
daughter
's
fortune
did
not
suffice
for
the
purchase
of
handsome
*NL*
furniture
,
together
with
a
stock
of
wine
,
a
grand
piano
,
and
the
*NL*
laying
out
of
a
superior
flower-garden
,
it
followed
in
the
most
*NL*
rigorous
manner
,
either
that
these
things
must
be
procured
by
some
*NL*
other
means
,
or
else
that
the
Rev.
Mr.
Stelling
must
go
without
them
,
*NL*
which
last
alternative
would
be
an
absurd
procrastination
of
the
*NL*
fruits
of
success
,
where
success
was
certain
.
Mr.
Stelling
was
so
*NL*
broad-chested
and
resolute
that
he
felt
equal
to
anything
;
he
would
*NL*
become
celebrated
by
shaking
the
consciences
of
his
hearers
,
and
he
*NL*
would
by
and
by
edit
a
Greek
play
,
and
invent
several
new
readings
.
He
*NL*
had
not
yet
selected
the
play
,
for
having
been
married
little
more
*NL*
than
two
years
,
his
leisure
time
had
been
much
occupied
with
*NL*
attentions
to
Mrs.
Stelling
;
but
he
had
told
that
fine
woman
what
he
*NL*
meant
to
do
some
day
,
and
she
felt
great
confidence
in
her
husband
,
as
*NL*
a
man
who
understood
everything
of
that
sort
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
immediate
step
to
future
success
was
to
bring
on
Tom
Tulliver
*NL*
during
this
first
half-year
;
for
,
by
a
singular
coincidence
,
there
had
*NL*
been
some
negotiation
concerning
another
pupil
from
the
same
*NL*
neighborhood
and
it
might
further
a
decision
in
Mr.
Stelling
's
favor
,
*NL*
if
it
were
understood
that
young
Tulliver
,
who
,
Mr.
Stelling
observed
*NL*
in
conjugal
privacy
,
was
rather
a
rough
cub
,
had
made
prodigious
*NL*
progress
in
a
short
time
.
It
was
on
this
ground
that
he
was
severe
*NL*
with
Tom
about
his
lessons
;
he
was
clearly
a
boy
whose
powers
would
*NL*
never
be
developed
through
the
medium
of
the
Latin
grammar
,
without
*NL*
the
application
of
some
sternness
.
Not
that
Mr.
Stelling
was
a
*NL*
harsh-tempered
or
unkind
man
;
quite
the
contrary
.
He
was
jocose
with
*NL*
Tom
at
table
,
and
corrected
his
provincialisms
and
his
deportment
in
*NL*
the
most
playful
manner
;
but
poor
Tom
was
only
the
more
cowed
and
*NL*
confused
by
this
double
novelty
,
for
he
had
never
been
used
to
jokes
*NL*
at
all
like
Mr.
Stelling
's
;
and
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
had
*NL*
a
painful
sense
that
he
was
all
wrong
somehow
.
When
Mr.
Stelling
said
,
*NL*
as
the
roast-beef
was
being
uncovered
,
``
Now
,
Tulliver
!
which
would
you
*NL*
rather
decline
,
roast-beef
or
the
Latin
for
it
?
''
Tom
,
to
whom
in
his
*NL*
coolest
moments
a
pun
would
have
been
a
hard
nut
,
was
thrown
into
a
*NL*
state
of
embarrassed
alarm
that
made
everything
dim
to
him
except
the
*NL*
feeling
that
he
would
rather
not
have
anything
to
do
with
Latin
;
of
*NL*
course
he
answered
,
``
Roast-beef
,
''
whereupon
there
followed
much
*NL*
laughter
and
some
practical
joking
with
the
plates
,
from
which
Tom
*NL*
gathered
that
he
had
in
some
mysterious
way
refused
beef
,
and
,
in
*NL*
fact
,
made
himself
appear
``
a
silly
.
''
If
he
could
have
seen
a
*NL*
fellow-pupil
undergo
these
painful
operations
and
survive
them
in
good
*NL*
spirits
,
he
might
sooner
have
taken
them
as
a
matter
of
course
.
But
*NL*
there
are
two
expensive
forms
of
education
,
either
of
which
a
parent
*NL*
may
procure
for
his
son
by
sending
him
as
solitary
pupil
to
a
*NL*
clergyman
:
one
is
the
enjoyment
of
the
reverend
gentleman
's
undivided
*NL*
neglect
;
the
other
is
the
endurance
of
the
reverend
gentleman
's
*NL*
undivided
attention
.
It
was
the
latter
privilege
for
which
Mr.
*NL*
Tulliver
paid
a
high
price
in
Tom
's
initiatory
months
at
King
's
*NL*
Lorton
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
respectable
miller
and
maltster
had
left
Tom
behind
,
and
driven
*NL*
homeward
in
a
state
of
great
mental
satisfaction
.
He
considered
that
*NL*
it
was
a
happy
moment
for
him
when
he
had
thought
of
asking
Riley
's
*NL*
advice
about
a
tutor
for
Tom
.
Mr.
Stelling
's
eyes
were
so
wide
open
,
*NL*
and
he
talked
in
such
an
off-hand
,
matter-of-fact
way
,
answering
every
*NL*
difficult
,
slow
remark
of
Mr.
Tulliver
's
with
,
``
I
see
,
my
good
sir
,
I
*NL*
see
''
;
``
To
be
sure
,
to
be
sure
''
;
``
You
want
your
son
to
be
a
man
who
*NL*
will
make
his
way
in
the
world
,
''
--
that
Mr.
Tulliver
was
delighted
to
*NL*
find
in
him
a
clergyman
whose
knowledge
was
so
applicable
to
the
*NL*
every-day
affairs
of
this
life
.
Except
Counsellor
Wylde
,
whom
he
had
*NL*
heard
at
the
last
sessions
,
Mr.
Tulliver
thought
the
Rev.
Mr
Stelling
*NL*
was
the
shrewdest
fellow
he
had
ever
met
with
,
--
not
unlike
Wylde
,
in
*NL*
fact
;
he
had
the
same
way
of
sticking
his
thumbs
in
the
armholes
of
*NL*
his
waistcoat
.
Mr.
Tulliver
was
not
by
any
means
an
exception
in
*NL*
mistaking
brazenness
for
shrewdness
;
most
laymen
thought
Stelling
*NL*
shrewd
,
and
a
man
of
remarkable
powers
generally
;
it
was
chiefly
by
*NL*
his
clerical
brethren
that
he
was
considered
rather
a
full
fellow
.
But
*NL*
he
told
Mr.
Tulliver
several
stories
about
``
Swing
''
and
incendiarism
,
*NL*
and
asked
his
advice
about
feeding
pigs
in
so
thoroughly
secular
and
*NL*
judicious
a
manner
,
with
so
much
polished
glibness
of
tongue
,
that
the
*NL*
miller
thought
,
here
was
the
very
thing
he
wanted
for
Tom
.
He
had
no
*NL*
doubt
this
first-rate
man
was
acquainted
with
every
branch
of
*NL*
information
,
and
knew
exactly
what
Tom
must
learn
in
order
to
become
a
*NL*
match
for
the
lawyers
,
which
poor
Mr.
Tulliver
himself
did
_
not
_
know
,
*NL*
and
so
was
necessarily
thrown
for
self-direction
on
this
wide
kind
of
*NL*
inference
.
It
is
hardly
fair
to
laugh
at
him
,
for
I
have
known
much
*NL*
more
highly
instructed
persons
than
he
make
inferences
quite
as
wide
,
*NL*
and
not
at
all
wiser
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
finding
that
Mrs.
Stelling
's
views
as
to
the
*NL*
airing
of
linen
and
the
frequent
recurrence
of
hunger
in
a
growing
boy
*NL*
entirely
coincided
with
her
own
;
moreover
,
that
Mrs.
Stelling
,
though
*NL*
so
young
a
woman
,
and
only
anticipating
her
second
confinement
,
had
*NL*
gone
through
very
nearly
the
same
experience
as
herself
with
regard
to
*NL*
the
behavior
and
fundamental
character
of
the
monthly
nurse
,
--
she
*NL*
expressed
great
contentment
to
her
husband
,
when
they
drove
away
,
at
*NL*
leaving
Tom
with
a
woman
who
,
in
spite
of
her
youth
,
seemed
quite
*NL*
sensible
and
motherly
,
and
asked
advice
as
prettily
as
could
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
must
be
very
well
off
,
though
,
''
said
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
``
for
*NL*
everything
's
as
nice
as
can
be
all
over
the
house
,
and
that
watered
*NL*
silk
she
had
on
cost
a
pretty
penny
.
Sister
Pullet
has
got
one
like
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
said
Mr.
Tulliver
,
``
he
's
got
some
income
besides
the
curacy
,
I
*NL*
reckon
.
Perhaps
her
father
allows
'em
something
.
There
's
Tom
`
ull
be
*NL*
another
hundred
to
him
,
and
not
much
trouble
either
,
by
his
own
*NL*
account
;
he
says
teaching
comes
natural
to
him
.
That
's
wonderful
,
*NL*
now
,
''
added
Mr.
Tulliver
,
turning
his
head
on
one
side
,
and
giving
his
*NL*
horse
a
meditative
tickling
on
the
flank
.
*NL*
*NL*
Perhaps
it
was
because
teaching
came
naturally
to
Mr.
Stelling
,
that
*NL*
he
set
about
it
with
that
uniformity
of
method
and
independence
of
*NL*
circumstances
which
distinguish
the
actions
of
animals
understood
to
*NL*
be
under
the
immediate
teaching
of
nature
.
Mr.
Broderip
's
amiable
*NL*
beaver
,
as
that
charming
naturalist
tells
us
,
busied
himself
as
*NL*
earnestly
in
constructing
a
dam
,
in
a
room
up
three
pair
of
stairs
in
*NL*
London
,
as
if
he
had
been
laying
his
foundation
in
a
stream
or
lake
in
*NL*
Upper
Canada
.
It
was
``
Binny
's
''
function
to
build
;
the
absence
of
water
*NL*
or
of
possible
progeny
was
an
accident
for
which
he
was
not
*NL*
accountable
.
With
the
same
unerring
instinct
Mr.
Stelling
set
to
work
*NL*
at
his
natural
method
of
instilling
the
Eton
Grammar
and
Euclid
into
*NL*
the
mind
of
Tom
Tulliver
.
This
,
he
considered
,
was
the
only
basis
of
*NL*
solid
instruction
;
all
other
means
of
education
were
mere
*NL*
charlatanism
,
and
could
produce
nothing
better
than
smatterers
.
Fixed
*NL*
on
this
firm
basis
,
a
man
might
observe
the
display
of
various
or
*NL*
special
knowledge
made
by
irregularly
educated
people
with
a
pitying
*NL*
smile
;
all
that
sort
of
thing
was
very
well
,
but
it
was
impossible
*NL*
these
people
could
form
sound
opinions
.
In
holding
this
conviction
Mr.
*NL*
Stelling
was
not
biassed
,
as
some
tutors
have
been
,
by
the
excessive
*NL*
accuracy
or
extent
of
his
own
scholarship
;
and
as
to
his
views
about
*NL*
Euclid
,
no
opinion
could
have
been
freer
from
personal
partiality
.
Mr.
*NL*
Stelling
was
very
far
from
being
led
astray
by
enthusiasm
,
either
*NL*
religious
or
intellectual
;
on
the
other
hand
,
he
had
no
secret
belief
*NL*
that
everything
was
humbug
.
He
thought
religion
was
a
very
excellent
*NL*
thing
,
and
Aristotle
a
great
authority
,
and
deaneries
and
prebends
*NL*
useful
institutions
,
and
Great
Britain
the
providential
bulwark
of
*NL*
Protestantism
,
and
faith
in
the
unseen
a
great
support
to
afflicted
*NL*
minds
;
he
believed
in
all
these
things
,
as
a
Swiss
hotel-keeper
*NL*
believes
in
the
beauty
of
the
scenery
around
him
,
and
in
the
pleasure
*NL*
it
gives
to
artistic
visitors
.
And
in
the
same
way
Mr.
Stelling
*NL*
believed
in
his
method
of
education
;
he
had
no
doubt
that
he
was
doing
*NL*
the
very
best
thing
for
Mr.
Tulliver
's
boy
.
Of
course
,
when
the
miller
*NL*
talked
of
``
mapping
''
and
``
summing
''
in
a
vague
and
diffident
manner
,
Mr
*NL*
Stelling
had
set
his
mind
at
rest
by
an
assurance
that
he
understood
*NL*
what
was
wanted
;
for
how
was
it
possible
the
good
man
could
form
any
*NL*
reasonable
judgment
about
the
matter
?
Mr
Stelling
's
duty
was
to
teach
*NL*
the
lad
in
the
only
right
way
,
--
indeed
he
knew
no
other
;
he
had
not
*NL*
wasted
his
time
in
the
acquirement
of
anything
abnormal
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
very
soon
set
down
poor
Tom
as
a
thoroughly
stupid
lad
;
for
though
*NL*
by
hard
labor
he
could
get
particular
declensions
into
his
brain
,
*NL*
anything
so
abstract
as
the
relation
between
cases
and
terminations
*NL*
could
by
no
means
get
such
a
lodgment
there
as
to
enable
him
to
*NL*
recognize
a
chance
genitive
or
dative
.
This
struck
Mr.
Stelling
as
*NL*
something
more
than
natural
stupidity
;
he
suspected
obstinacy
,
or
at
*NL*
any
rate
indifference
,
and
lectured
Tom
severely
on
his
want
of
*NL*
thorough
application
.
``
You
feel
no
interest
in
what
you
're
doing
,
*NL*
sir
,
''
Mr.
Stelling
would
say
,
and
the
reproach
was
painfully
true
.
Tom
*NL*
had
never
found
any
difficulty
in
discerning
a
pointer
from
a
setter
,
*NL*
when
once
he
had
been
told
the
distinction
,
and
his
perceptive
powers
*NL*
were
not
at
all
deficient
.
I
fancy
they
were
quite
as
strong
as
those
*NL*
of
the
Rev.
Mr.
Stelling
;
for
Tom
could
predict
with
accuracy
what
*NL*
number
of
horses
were
cantering
behind
him
,
he
could
throw
a
stone
*NL*
right
into
the
centre
of
a
given
ripple
,
he
could
guess
to
a
fraction
*NL*
how
many
lengths
of
his
stick
it
would
take
to
reach
across
the
*NL*
playground
,
and
could
draw
almost
perfect
squares
on
his
slate
without
*NL*
any
measurement
.
But
Mr.
Stelling
took
no
note
of
these
things
;
he
*NL*
only
observed
that
Tom
's
faculties
failed
him
before
the
abstractions
*NL*
hideously
symbolized
to
him
in
the
pages
of
the
Eton
Grammar
,
and
that
*NL*
he
was
in
a
state
bordering
on
idiocy
with
regard
to
the
demonstration
*NL*
that
two
given
triangles
must
be
equal
,
though
he
could
discern
with
*NL*
great
promptitude
and
certainty
the
fact
that
they
_
were
_
equal
.
*NL*
Whence
Mr.
Stelling
concluded
that
Tom
's
brain
,
being
peculiarly
*NL*
impervious
to
etymology
and
demonstrations
,
was
peculiarly
in
need
of
*NL*
being
ploughed
and
harrowed
by
these
patent
implements
;
it
was
his
*NL*
favorite
metaphor
,
that
the
classics
and
geometry
constituted
that
*NL*
culture
of
the
mind
which
prepared
it
for
the
reception
of
any
*NL*
subsequent
crop
.
I
say
nothing
against
Mr.
Stelling
's
theory
;
if
we
*NL*
are
to
have
one
regimen
for
all
minds
,
his
seems
to
me
as
good
as
any
*NL*
other
.
I
only
know
it
turned
out
as
uncomfortably
for
Tom
Tulliver
as
*NL*
if
he
had
been
plied
with
cheese
in
order
to
remedy
a
gastric
weakness
*NL*
which
prevented
him
from
digesting
it
.
It
is
astonishing
what
a
*NL*
different
result
one
gets
by
changing
the
metaphor
!
Once
call
the
*NL*
brain
an
intellectual
stomach
,
and
one
's
ingenious
conception
of
the
*NL*
classics
and
geometry
as
ploughs
and
harrows
seems
to
settle
nothing
.
*NL*
But
then
it
is
open
to
some
one
else
to
follow
great
authorities
,
and
*NL*
call
the
mind
a
sheet
of
white
paper
or
a
mirror
,
in
which
case
one
's
*NL*
knowledge
of
the
digestive
process
becomes
quite
irrelevant
.
It
was
*NL*
doubtless
an
ingenious
idea
to
call
the
camel
the
ship
of
the
desert
,
*NL*
but
it
would
hardly
lead
one
far
in
training
that
useful
beast
.
O
*NL*
Aristotle
!
if
you
had
had
the
advantage
of
being
``
the
freshest
modern
''
*NL*
instead
of
the
greatest
ancient
,
would
you
not
have
mingled
your
*NL*
praise
of
metaphorical
speech
,
as
a
sign
of
high
intelligence
,
with
a
*NL*
lamentation
that
intelligence
so
rarely
shows
itself
in
speech
without
*NL*
metaphor
,
--
that
we
can
so
seldom
declare
what
a
thing
is
,
except
by
*NL*
saying
it
is
something
else
?
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
Tulliver
,
being
abundant
in
no
form
of
speech
,
did
not
use
any
*NL*
metaphor
to
declare
his
views
as
to
the
nature
of
Latin
;
he
never
*NL*
called
it
an
instrument
of
torture
;
and
it
was
not
until
he
had
got
on
*NL*
some
way
in
the
next
half-year
,
and
in
the
Delectus
,
that
he
was
*NL*
advanced
enough
to
call
it
a
``
bore
''
and
``
beastly
stuff
.
''
At
present
,
*NL*
in
relation
to
this
demand
that
he
should
learn
Latin
declensions
and
*NL*
conjugations
,
Tom
was
in
a
state
of
as
blank
unimaginativeness
*NL*
concerning
the
cause
and
tendency
of
his
sufferings
,
as
if
he
had
been
*NL*
an
innocent
shrewmouse
imprisoned
in
the
split
trunk
of
an
ash-tree
in
*NL*
order
to
cure
lameness
in
cattle
.
It
is
doubtless
almost
incredible
to
*NL*
instructed
minds
of
the
present
day
that
a
boy
of
twelve
,
not
*NL*
belonging
strictly
to
``
the
masses
,
''
who
are
now
understood
to
have
the
*NL*
monopoly
of
mental
darkness
,
should
have
had
no
distinct
idea
how
*NL*
there
came
to
be
such
a
thing
as
Latin
on
this
earth
;
yet
so
it
was
*NL*
with
Tom
.
It
would
have
taken
a
long
while
to
make
conceivable
to
him
*NL*
that
there
ever
existed
a
people
who
bought
and
sold
sheep
and
oxen
,
*NL*
and
transacted
the
every-day
affairs
of
life
,
through
the
medium
of
*NL*
this
language
;
and
still
longer
to
make
him
understand
why
he
should
*NL*
be
called
upon
to
learn
it
,
when
its
connection
with
those
affairs
had
*NL*
become
entirely
latent
.
So
far
as
Tom
had
gained
any
acquaintance
with
*NL*
the
Romans
at
Mr.
Jacob
's
academy
,
his
knowledge
was
strictly
correct
,
*NL*
but
it
went
no
farther
than
the
fact
that
they
were
``
in
the
New
*NL*
Testament
''
;
and
Mr.
Stelling
was
not
the
man
to
enfeeble
and
*NL*
emasculate
his
pupil
's
mind
by
simplifying
and
explaining
,
or
to
*NL*
reduce
the
tonic
effect
of
etymology
by
mixing
it
with
smattering
,
*NL*
extraneous
information
,
such
as
is
given
to
girls
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
,
strange
to
say
,
under
this
vigorous
treatment
Tom
became
more
*NL*
like
a
girl
than
he
had
ever
been
in
his
life
before
.
He
had
a
large
*NL*
share
of
pride
,
which
had
hitherto
found
itself
very
comfortable
in
*NL*
the
world
,
despising
Old
Goggles
,
and
reposing
in
the
sense
of
*NL*
unquestioned
rights
;
but
now
this
same
pride
met
with
nothing
but
*NL*
bruises
and
crushings
.
Tom
was
too
clear-sighted
not
to
be
aware
that
*NL*
Mr.
Stelling
's
standard
of
things
was
quite
different
,
was
certainly
*NL*
something
higher
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
than
that
of
the
people
he
*NL*
had
been
living
amongst
,
and
that
,
brought
in
contact
with
it
,
he
,
Tom
*NL*
Tulliver
,
appeared
uncouth
and
stupid
;
he
was
by
no
means
indifferent
*NL*
to
this
,
and
his
pride
got
into
an
uneasy
condition
which
quite
*NL*
nullified
his
boyish
self-satisfaction
,
and
gave
him
something
of
the
*NL*
girl
's
susceptibility
.
He
was
a
very
firm
,
not
to
say
obstinate
,
*NL*
disposition
,
but
there
was
no
brute-like
rebellion
and
recklessness
in
*NL*
his
nature
;
the
human
sensibilities
predominated
,
and
if
it
had
*NL*
occurred
to
him
that
he
could
enable
himself
to
show
some
quickness
at
*NL*
his
lessons
,
and
so
acquire
Mr.
Stelling
's
approbation
,
by
standing
on
*NL*
one
leg
for
an
inconvenient
length
of
time
,
or
rapping
his
head
*NL*
moderately
against
the
wall
,
or
any
voluntary
action
of
that
sort
,
he
*NL*
would
certainly
have
tried
it
.
But
no
;
Tom
had
never
heard
that
these
*NL*
measures
would
brighten
the
understanding
,
or
strengthen
the
verbal
*NL*
memory
;
and
he
was
not
given
to
hypothesis
and
experiment
.
It
did
*NL*
occur
to
him
that
he
could
perhaps
get
some
help
by
praying
for
it
;
*NL*
but
as
the
prayers
he
said
every
evening
were
forms
learned
by
heart
,
*NL*
he
rather
shrank
from
the
novelty
and
irregularity
of
introducing
an
*NL*
extempore
passage
on
a
topic
of
petition
for
which
he
was
not
aware
of
*NL*
any
precedent
.
But
one
day
,
when
he
had
broken
down
,
for
the
fifth
*NL*
time
,
in
the
supines
of
the
third
conjugation
,
and
Mr.
Stelling
,
*NL*
convinced
that
this
must
be
carelessness
,
since
it
transcended
the
*NL*
bounds
of
possible
stupidity
,
had
lectured
him
very
seriously
,
*NL*
pointing
out
that
if
he
failed
to
seize
the
present
golden
opportunity
*NL*
of
learning
supines
,
he
would
have
to
regret
it
when
he
became
a
*NL*
man
,
--
Tom
,
more
miserable
than
usual
,
determined
to
try
his
sole
*NL*
resource
;
and
that
evening
,
after
his
usual
form
of
prayer
for
his
*NL*
parents
and
``
little
sister
''
-LRB-
he
had
begun
to
pray
for
Maggie
when
she
*NL*
was
a
baby
-RRB-
,
and
that
he
might
be
able
always
to
keep
God
's
*NL*
commandments
,
he
added
,
in
the
same
low
whisper
,
``
and
please
to
make
*NL*
me
always
remember
my
Latin
.
''
He
paused
a
little
to
consider
how
he
*NL*
should
pray
about
Euclid
--
whether
he
should
ask
to
see
what
it
meant
,
*NL*
or
whether
there
was
any
other
mental
state
which
would
be
more
*NL*
applicable
to
the
case
.
But
at
last
he
added
:
``
And
make
Mr.
Stelling
*NL*
say
I
sha
'n'
t
do
Euclid
any
more
.
Amen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
fact
that
he
got
through
his
supines
without
mistake
the
next
day
,
*NL*
encouraged
him
to
persevere
in
this
appendix
to
his
prayers
,
and
*NL*
neutralized
any
scepticism
that
might
have
arisen
from
Mr.
Stelling
's
*NL*
continued
demand
for
Euclid
.
But
his
faith
broke
down
under
the
*NL*
apparent
absence
of
all
help
when
he
got
into
the
irregular
verbs
.
It
*NL*
seemed
clear
that
Tom
's
despair
under
the
caprices
of
the
present
*NL*
tense
did
not
constitute
a
_
nodus
_
worthy
of
interference
,
and
since
*NL*
this
was
the
climax
of
his
difficulties
,
where
was
the
use
of
praying
*NL*
for
help
any
longer
?
He
made
up
his
mind
to
this
conclusion
in
one
of
*NL*
his
dull
,
lonely
evenings
,
which
he
spent
in
the
study
,
preparing
his
*NL*
lessons
for
the
morrow
.
His
eyes
were
apt
to
get
dim
over
the
page
,
*NL*
though
he
hated
crying
,
and
was
ashamed
of
it
;
he
could
n't
help
*NL*
thinking
with
some
affection
even
of
Spouncer
,
whom
he
used
to
fight
*NL*
and
quarrel
with
;
he
would
have
felt
at
home
with
Spouncer
,
and
in
a
*NL*
condition
of
superiority
.
And
then
the
mill
,
and
the
river
,
and
Yap
*NL*
pricking
up
his
ears
,
ready
to
obey
the
least
sign
when
Tom
said
,
*NL*
``
Hoigh
!
''
would
all
come
before
him
in
a
sort
of
calenture
,
when
his
*NL*
fingers
played
absently
in
his
pocket
with
his
great
knife
and
his
*NL*
coil
of
whipcord
,
and
other
relics
of
the
past
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
,
as
I
said
,
had
never
been
so
much
like
a
girl
in
his
life
before
,
*NL*
and
at
that
epoch
of
irregular
verbs
his
spirit
was
further
depressed
*NL*
by
a
new
means
of
mental
development
which
had
been
thought
of
for
him
*NL*
out
of
school
hours
.
Mrs.
Stelling
had
lately
had
her
second
baby
,
and
*NL*
as
nothing
could
be
more
salutary
for
a
boy
than
to
feel
himself
*NL*
useful
,
Mrs.
Stelling
considered
she
was
doing
Tom
a
service
by
*NL*
setting
him
to
watch
the
little
cherub
Laura
while
the
nurse
was
*NL*
occupied
with
the
sickly
baby
.
It
was
quite
a
pretty
employment
for
*NL*
Tom
to
take
little
Laura
out
in
the
sunniest
hour
of
the
autumn
day
;
*NL*
it
would
help
to
make
him
feel
that
Lorton
Parsonage
was
a
home
for
*NL*
him
,
and
that
he
was
one
of
the
family
.
The
little
cherub
Laura
,
not
*NL*
being
an
accomplished
walker
at
present
,
had
a
ribbon
fastened
round
*NL*
her
waist
,
by
which
Tom
held
her
as
if
she
had
been
a
little
dog
*NL*
during
the
minutes
in
which
she
chose
to
walk
;
but
as
these
were
rare
,
*NL*
he
was
for
the
most
part
carrying
this
fine
child
round
and
round
the
*NL*
garden
,
within
sight
of
Mrs.
Stelling
's
window
,
according
to
orders
.
*NL*
If
any
one
considers
this
unfair
and
even
oppressive
toward
Tom
,
I
beg
*NL*
him
to
consider
that
there
are
feminine
virtues
which
are
with
*NL*
difficulty
combined
,
even
if
they
are
not
incompatible
.
When
the
wife
*NL*
of
a
poor
curate
contrives
,
under
all
her
disadvantages
,
to
dress
*NL*
extremely
well
,
and
to
have
a
style
of
coiffure
which
requires
that
*NL*
her
nurse
shall
occasionally
officiate
as
lady
's
-
maid
;
when
,
moreover
,
*NL*
her
dinner-parties
and
her
drawing-room
show
that
effort
at
elegance
*NL*
and
completeness
of
appointment
to
which
ordinary
women
might
imagine
*NL*
a
large
income
necessary
,
it
would
be
unreasonable
to
expect
of
her
*NL*
that
she
should
employ
a
second
nurse
,
or
even
act
as
a
nurse
herself
.
*NL*
Mr.
Stelling
knew
better
;
he
saw
that
his
wife
did
wonders
already
,
*NL*
and
was
proud
of
her
.
It
was
certainly
not
the
best
thing
in
the
world
*NL*
for
young
Tulliver
's
gait
to
carry
a
heavy
child
,
but
he
had
plenty
of
*NL*
exercise
in
long
walks
with
himself
,
and
next
half-year
Mr.
Stelling
*NL*
would
see
about
having
a
drilling-master
.
Among
the
many
means
whereby
*NL*
Mr.
Stelling
intended
to
be
more
fortunate
than
the
bulk
of
his
*NL*
fellow-men
,
he
had
entirely
given
up
that
of
having
his
own
way
in
his
*NL*
own
house
.
What
then
?
He
had
married
``
as
kind
a
little
soul
as
ever
*NL*
breathed
,
''
according
to
Mr.
Riley
,
who
had
been
acquainted
with
Mrs.
*NL*
Stelling
's
blond
ringlets
and
smiling
demeanor
throughout
her
maiden
*NL*
life
,
and
on
the
strength
of
that
knowledge
would
have
been
ready
any
*NL*
day
to
pronounce
that
whatever
domestic
differences
might
arise
in
her
*NL*
married
life
must
be
entirely
Mr.
Stelling
's
fault
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
Tom
had
had
a
worse
disposition
,
he
would
certainly
have
hated
the
*NL*
little
cherub
Laura
,
but
he
was
too
kind-hearted
a
lad
for
that
;
there
*NL*
was
too
much
in
him
of
the
fibre
that
turns
to
true
manliness
,
and
to
*NL*
protecting
pity
for
the
weak
.
I
am
afraid
he
hated
Mrs.
Stelling
,
and
*NL*
contracted
a
lasting
dislike
to
pale
blond
ringlets
and
broad
plaits
,
*NL*
as
directly
associated
with
haughtiness
of
manner
,
and
a
frequent
*NL*
reference
to
other
people
's
``
duty
.
''
But
he
could
n't
help
playing
with
*NL*
little
Laura
,
and
liking
to
amuse
her
;
he
even
sacrificed
his
*NL*
percussion-caps
for
her
sake
,
in
despair
of
their
ever
serving
a
*NL*
greater
purpose
,
--
thinking
the
small
flash
and
bang
would
delight
her
,
*NL*
and
thereby
drawing
down
on
himself
a
rebuke
from
Mrs.
Stelling
for
*NL*
teaching
her
child
to
play
with
fire
.
Laura
was
a
sort
of
*NL*
playfellow
--
and
oh
,
how
Tom
longed
for
playfellows
!
In
his
secret
*NL*
heart
he
yearned
to
have
Maggie
with
him
,
and
was
almost
ready
to
dote
*NL*
on
her
exasperating
acts
of
forgetfulness
;
though
,
when
he
was
at
*NL*
home
,
he
always
represented
it
as
a
great
favor
on
his
part
to
let
*NL*
Maggie
trot
by
his
side
on
his
pleasure
excursions
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
before
this
dreary
half-year
was
ended
,
Maggie
actually
came
.
Mrs.
*NL*
Stelling
had
given
a
general
invitation
for
the
little
girl
to
come
*NL*
and
stay
with
her
brother
;
so
when
Mr.
Tulliver
drove
over
to
King
's
*NL*
Lorton
late
in
October
,
Maggie
came
too
,
with
the
sense
that
she
was
*NL*
taking
a
great
journey
,
and
beginning
to
see
the
world
.
It
was
Mr.
*NL*
Tulliver
's
first
visit
to
see
Tom
,
for
the
lad
must
learn
not
to
think
*NL*
too
much
about
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
my
lad
,
''
he
said
to
Tom
,
when
Mr.
Stelling
had
left
the
room
to
*NL*
announce
the
arrival
to
his
wife
,
and
Maggie
had
begun
to
kiss
Tom
*NL*
freely
,
``
you
look
rarely
!
School
agrees
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
wished
he
had
looked
rather
ill
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
I
_
am
_
well
,
father
,
''
said
Tom
;
``
I
wish
you
'd
ask
Mr.
*NL*
Stelling
not
to
let
me
do
Euclid
;
it
brings
on
the
toothache
,
I
*NL*
think
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
The
toothache
was
the
only
malady
to
which
Tom
had
ever
been
*NL*
subject
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
``
Euclid
,
my
lad
,
--
why
,
what
's
that
?
''
said
Mr.
Tulliver
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
do
n't
know
;
it
's
definitions
,
and
axioms
,
and
triangles
,
and
*NL*
things
.
It
's
a
book
I
've
got
to
learn
in
--
there
's
no
sense
in
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
,
go
!
''
said
Mr.
Tulliver
,
reprovingly
;
``
you
must
n't
say
so
.
You
*NL*
must
learn
what
your
master
tells
you
.
He
knows
what
it
's
right
for
*NL*
you
to
learn
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
I
'll
_
help
you
now
,
Tom
,
''
said
Maggie
,
with
a
little
air
of
*NL*
patronizing
consolation
.
``
I
'm
come
to
stay
ever
so
long
,
if
Mrs.
*NL*
Stelling
asks
me
.
I
've
brought
my
box
and
my
pinafores
,
have
n't
I
,
*NL*
father
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
You
_
help
me
,
you
silly
little
thing
!
''
said
Tom
,
in
such
high
*NL*
spirits
at
this
announcement
that
he
quite
enjoyed
the
idea
of
*NL*
confounding
Maggie
by
showing
her
a
page
of
Euclid
.
``
I
should
like
to
*NL*
see
you
doing
one
of
_
my
_
lessons
!
Why
,
I
learn
Latin
too
!
Girls
never
*NL*
learn
such
things
.
They
're
too
silly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
what
Latin
is
very
well
,
''
said
Maggie
,
confidently
,
``
Latin
's
a
*NL*
language
.
There
are
Latin
words
in
the
Dictionary
.
There
's
bonus
,
a
*NL*
gift
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
you
're
just
wrong
there
,
Miss
Maggie
!
''
said
Tom
,
secretly
*NL*
astonished
.
``
You
think
you
're
very
wise
!
But
`
bonus
'
means
`
good
,
'
as
*NL*
it
happens
,
--
bonus
,
bona
,
bonum
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
that
's
no
reason
why
it
should
n't
mean
`
gift
,
'
''
said
Maggie
,
*NL*
stoutly
.
``
It
may
mean
several
things
;
almost
every
word
does
.
There
's
*NL*
`
lawn
,
'
--
it
means
the
grass-plot
,
as
well
as
the
stuff
*NL*
pocket-handkerchiefs
are
made
of
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
done
,
little
`
un
,
''
said
Mr.
Tulliver
,
laughing
,
while
Tom
felt
*NL*
rather
disgusted
with
Maggie
's
knowingness
,
though
beyond
measure
*NL*
cheerful
at
the
thought
that
she
was
going
to
stay
with
him
.
Her
*NL*
conceit
would
soon
be
overawed
by
the
actual
inspection
of
his
books
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Stelling
,
in
her
pressing
invitation
,
did
not
mention
a
longer
*NL*
time
than
a
week
for
Maggie
's
stay
;
but
Mr.
Stelling
,
who
took
her
*NL*
between
his
knees
,
and
asked
her
where
she
stole
her
dark
eyes
from
,
*NL*
insisted
that
she
must
stay
a
fortnight
.
Maggie
thought
Mr.
Stelling
*NL*
was
a
charming
man
,
and
Mr.
Tulliver
was
quite
proud
to
leave
his
*NL*
little
wench
where
she
would
have
an
opportunity
of
showing
her
*NL*
cleverness
to
appreciating
strangers
.
So
it
was
agreed
that
she
should
*NL*
not
be
fetched
home
till
the
end
of
the
fortnight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
then
,
come
with
me
into
the
study
,
Maggie
,
''
said
Tom
,
as
their
*NL*
father
drove
away
.
``
What
do
you
shake
and
toss
your
head
now
for
,
you
*NL*
silly
?
''
he
continued
;
for
though
her
hair
was
now
under
a
new
*NL*
dispensation
,
and
was
brushed
smoothly
behind
her
ears
,
she
seemed
*NL*
still
in
imagination
to
be
tossing
it
out
of
her
eyes
.
``
It
makes
you
*NL*
look
as
if
you
were
crazy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
ca
n't
help
it
,
''
said
Maggie
,
impatiently
.
``
Do
n't
tease
me
,
Tom
.
*NL*
Oh
,
what
books
!
''
she
exclaimed
,
as
she
saw
the
bookcases
in
the
study
.
*NL*
``
How
I
should
like
to
have
as
many
books
as
that
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
you
could
n't
read
one
of
'em
,
''
said
Tom
,
triumphantly
.
``
They
're
*NL*
all
Latin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
they
are
n't

''
said
Maggie
.
``
I
can
read
the
back
of
*NL*
this

History
of
the
Decline
and
Fall
of
the
Roman
Empire
.

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
does
that
mean
?
_
You
_
do
n't
know

''
said
Tom
,
wagging
his
*NL*
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
could
soon
find
out
,
''
said
Maggie
,
scornfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
how
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
look
inside
,
and
see
what
it
was
about
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'd
better
not
,
Miss
Maggie
,
''
said
Tom
,
seeing
her
hand
on
the
*NL*
volume
.
``
Mr.
Stelling
lets
nobody
touch
his
books
without
leave
,
and
*NL*
_
I
_
shall
catch
it
,
if
you
take
it
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
very
well
.
Let
me
see
all
_
your
_
books
,
then
,
''
said
Maggie
,
*NL*
turning
to
throw
her
arms
round
Tom
's
neck
,
and
rub
his
cheek
with
her
*NL*
small
round
nose
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
,
in
the
gladness
of
his
heart
at
having
dear
old
Maggie
to
dispute
*NL*
with
and
crow
over
again
,
seized
her
round
the
waist
,
and
began
to
*NL*
jump
with
her
round
the
large
library
table
.
Away
they
jumped
with
*NL*
more
and
more
vigor
,
till
Maggie
's
hair
flew
from
behind
her
ears
,
and
*NL*
twirled
about
like
an
animated
mop
.
But
the
revolutions
round
the
*NL*
table
became
more
and
more
irregular
in
their
sweep
,
till
at
last
*NL*
reaching
Mr.
Stelling
's
reading
stand
,
they
sent
it
thundering
down
*NL*
with
its
heavy
lexicons
to
the
floor
.
Happily
it
was
the
ground-floor
,
*NL*
and
the
study
was
a
one-storied
wing
to
the
house
,
so
that
the
*NL*
downfall
made
no
alarming
resonance
,
though
Tom
stood
dizzy
and
aghast
*NL*
for
a
few
minutes
,
dreading
the
appearance
of
Mr.
or
Mrs.
Stelling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
say
,
Maggie
,
''
said
Tom
at
last
,
lifting
up
the
stand
,
``
we
must
*NL*
keep
quiet
here
,
you
know
.
If
we
break
anything
Mrs.
Stelling
'll
make
*NL*
us
cry
peccavi
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
that
?
''
said
Maggie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it
's
the
Latin
for
a
good
scolding
,
''
said
Tom
,
not
without
some
*NL*
pride
in
his
knowledge
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
she
a
cross
woman
?
''
said
Maggie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
you
!
''
said
Tom
,
with
an
emphatic
nod
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
all
women
are
crosser
than
men
,
''
said
Maggie
.
``
Aunt
Glegg
's
a
*NL*
great
deal
crosser

uncle
Glegg

scolds
me
more

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,

you
'll
_
be
a

some
day
,

said
Tom
,
``
so

you

talk

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
shall
be

said
Maggie
,
with
a
toss
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
dare
say
,
and
a
nasty
conceited
thing

Everybody
'll
hate
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
ought
n't
to
hate
me

Tom

it
'll
be
very
wicked
of
you

*NL*
shall
be
your

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

*NL*
``
Oh

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

never

Come
,
it
's
time
for
me
to
learn
my
lessons
.
*NL*
See
here
!
what
I
've
got
to
do
,
''
said
Tom
,
drawing
Maggie
toward
him
*NL*
and
showing
her
his
theorem
,
while
she
pushed
her
hair
behind
her
*NL*
ears
,
and
prepared
herself
to
prove
her
capability
of
helping
him
in
*NL*
Euclid
.
She
began
to
read
with
full
confidence
in
her
own
powers
,
but
*NL*
presently
,
becoming
quite
bewildered
,
her
face
flushed
with
*NL*
irritation
.
It
was
unavoidable
;
she
must
confess
her
incompetency
,
and
*NL*
she
was
not
fond
of
humiliation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
nonsense
!
''
she
said
,
``
and
very
ugly
stuff
;
nobody
need
want
to
*NL*
make
it
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
there
,
now
,
Miss
Maggie
!
''
said
Tom
,
drawing
the
book
away
,
and
*NL*
wagging
his
head
at
her
,
``
You
see
you
're
not
so
clever
as
you
thought
*NL*
you
were
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
said
Maggie
,
pouting
,
``
I
dare
say
I
could
make
it
out
,
if
I
'd
*NL*
learned
what
goes
before
,
as
you
have
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
that
's
what
you
just
could
n't
,
Miss
Wisdom
,
''
said
Tom
.
``
For
it
's
*NL*
all
the
harder
when
you
know
what
goes
before
;
for
then
you
've
got
to
*NL*
say
what
definition
3
is
,
and
what
axiom
V.
is
.
But
get
along
with
you
*NL*
now
;
I
must
go
on
with
this
.
Here
's
the
Latin
Grammar
.
See
what
you
*NL*
can
make
of
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
found
the
Latin
Grammar
quite
soothing
after
her
mathematical
*NL*
mortification
;
for
she
delighted
in
new
words
,
and
quickly
found
that
*NL*
there
was
an
English
Key
at
the
end
,
which
would
make
her
very
wise
*NL*
about
Latin
,
at
slight
expense
.
She
presently
made
up
her
mind
to
skip
*NL*
the
rules
in
the
Syntax
,
the
examples
became
so
absorbing
.
These
*NL*
mysterious
sentences
,
snatched
from
an
unknown
context
,
--
like
strange
*NL*
horns
of
beasts
,
and
leaves
of
unknown
plants
,
brought
from
some
*NL*
far-off
region
,
--
gave
boundless
scope
to
her
imagination
,
and
were
all
*NL*
the
more
fascinating
because
they
were
in
a
peculiar
tongue
of
their
*NL*
own
,
which
she
could
learn
to
interpret
.
It
was
really
very
*NL*
interesting
,
the
Latin
Grammar
that
Tom
had
said
no
girls
could
learn
;
*NL*
and
she
was
proud
because
she
found
it
interesting
.
The
most
*NL*
fragmentary
examples
were
her
favourites
.
_
Mors
omnibus
est
communis
_
*NL*
would
have
been
jejune
,
only
she
liked
to
know
the
Latin
;
but
the
*NL*
fortunate
gentleman
whom
every
one
congratulated
because
he
had
a
son
*NL*
``
endowed
with
_
such
_
a
disposition
''
afforded
her
a
great
deal
of
*NL*
pleasant
conjecture
,
and
she
was
quite
lost
in
the
``
thick
grove
*NL*
penetrable
by
no
star
,
''
when
Tom
called
out
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
then
,
Magsie
,
give
us
the
Grammar
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Tom
,
it
's
such
a
pretty
book
!
''
she
said
,
as
she
jumped
out
of
the
*NL*
large
arm-chair
to
give
it
him
;
``
it
's
much
prettier
than
the
*NL*
Dictionary
.
I
could
learn
Latin
very
soon
.
I
do
n't
think
it
's
at
all
*NL*
hard
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
know
what
you
've
been
doing
,
''
said
Tom
;
``
you
've
been
reading
*NL*
the
English
at
the
end
.
Any
donkey
can
do
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
seized
the
book
and
opened
it
with
a
determined
and
business-like
*NL*
air
,
as
much
as
to
say
that
he
had
a
lesson
to
learn
which
no
donkeys
*NL*
would
find
themselves
equal
to
.
Maggie
,
rather
piqued
,
turned
to
the
*NL*
bookcases
to
amuse
herself
with
puzzling
out
the
titles
.
*NL*
*NL*
Presently
Tom
called
to
her
:
``
Here
,
Magsie
,
come
and
hear
if
I
can
say
*NL*
this
.
Stand
at
that
end
of
the
table
,
where
Mr.
Stelling
sits
when
he
*NL*
hears
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
obeyed
,
and
took
the
open
book
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
do
you
begin
,
Tom
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
begin
at
_
`
Appellativa

,
'
_
because
I
say
all
over
again
*NL*
what
I
've
been
learning
this
week
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
sailed
along
pretty
well
for
three
lines
;
and
Maggie
was
beginning
*NL*
to
forget
her
office
of
prompter
in
speculating
as
to
what
_
mas
_
could
*NL*
mean
,
which
came
twice
over
,
when
he
stuck
fast
at
_
Sunt

*NL*

_
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do

Maggie

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
Maggie
,
opening
her
mouth
and
shaking
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Sunt

''
said
Tom
,
very
slowly
,
as
if
the
next
words
*NL*
might
be
expected
to
come
sooner
when
he
gave
them
this
strong
hint
*NL*
that
they
were
waited
for
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
C

said
Maggie
,
getting
impatient
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

said
Tom
.
''
_
Ceu

--

''
Tom
took
his
pencil
and
made
several
hard
*NL*
dots
with
it
on
his
book-cover
--
''
_
ferarum
_
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

Maggie
,
``

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
Tom
;
``

''
*NL*
*NL*
With
some
further
stammering
and
repetition
,
Tom
got
through
the
next
*NL*
few
lines
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now

he
said
,

*NL*
*NL*
After
some
whispered
gabbling
,
assisted
by
the
beating
of
his
fist
on
*NL*
the
table
,
Tom
returned
the
book

with
a

for
Tom

had
learned
this
omitted
passage

a

does
not

feel
the

n't
laugh
,
Tom
,
for
you
did
n't
remember
it
at
all
.
I
'm
*NL*
sure
it
's
spelt
so
;
how
was
I
to
know
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Phee-e-e-h
!
I
told
you
girls
could
n't
learn
Latin
.
It
's
_
Nomen
non
*NL*
crescens
genitivo
_
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
then
,
''
said
Maggie
,
pouting
.
``
I
can
say
that
as
well
as
you
*NL*
can
.
And
you
do
n't
mind
your
stops
.
For
you
ought
to
stop
twice
as
*NL*
long
at
a
semicolon
as
you
do
at
a
comma
,
and
you
make
the
longest
*NL*
stops
where
there
ought
to
be
no
stop
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
well
,
do
n't
chatter
.
Let
me
go
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
presently
fetched
to
spend
the
rest
of
the
evening
in
the
*NL*
drawing-room
,
and
Maggie
became
so
animated
with
Mr.
Stelling
,
who
,
*NL*
she
felt
sure
,
admired
her
cleverness
,
that
Tom
was
rather
amazed
and
*NL*
alarmed
at
her
audacity
.
But
she
was
suddenly
subdued
by
Mr.
*NL*
Stelling
's
alluding
to
a
little
girl
of
whom
he
had
heard
that
she
*NL*
once
ran
away
to
the
gypsies
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
very
odd
little
girl
that
must
be
!
''
said
Mrs.
Stelling
,
*NL*
meaning
to
be
playful
;
but
a
playfulness
that
turned
on
her
supposed
*NL*
oddity
was
not
at
all
to
Maggie
's
taste
.
She
feared
that
Mr.
Stelling
,
*NL*
after
all
,
did
not
think
much
of
her
,
and
went
to
bed
in
rather
low
*NL*
spirits
.
Mrs.
Stelling
,
she
felt
,
looked
at
her
as
if
she
thought
her
*NL*
hair
was
very
ugly
because
it
hung
down
straight
behind
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
it
was
a
very
happy
fortnight
to
Maggie
,
this
visit
to
*NL*
Tom
.
She
was
allowed
to
be
in
the
study
while
he
had
his
lessons
,
and
*NL*
in
her
various
readings
got
very
deep
into
the
examples
in
the
Latin
*NL*
Grammar
.
The
astronomer
who
hated
women
generally
caused
her
so
much
*NL*
puzzling
speculation
that
she
one
day
asked
Mr.
Stelling
if
all
*NL*
astronomers
hated
women
,
or
whether
it
was
only
this
particular
*NL*
astronomer
.
But
forestalling
his
answer
,
she
said
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
it
's
all
astronomers
;
because
,
you
know
,
they
live
up
in
*NL*
high
towers
,
and
if
the
women
came
there
they
might
talk
and
hinder
*NL*
them
from
looking
at
the
stars
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Stelling
liked
her
prattle
immensely
,
and
they
were
on
the
best
*NL*
terms
.
She
told
Tom
she
should
like
to
go
to
school
to
Mr.
Stelling
,
*NL*
as
he
did
,
and
learn
just
the
same
things
.
She
knew
she
could
do
*NL*
Euclid
,
for
she
had
looked
into
it
again
,
and
she
saw
what
A
B
C
*NL*
meant
;
they
were
the
names
of
the
lines
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sure
you
could
n't
do
it
,
now
,
''
said
Tom
;
``
and
I
'll
just
ask
Mr.
*NL*
Stelling
if
you
could
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
mind
,
''
said
the
little
conceited
minx
,
``
I
'll
ask
him
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Stelling
,
''
she
said
,
that
same
evening
when
they
were
in
the
*NL*
drawing-room
,
``
could
n't
I
do
Euclid
,
and
all
Tom
's
lessons
,
if
you
*NL*
were
to
teach
me
instead
of
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
you
could
n't
,
''
said
Tom
,
indignantly
.
``
Girls
ca
n't
do
Euclid
;
can
*NL*
they
,
sir
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
can
pick
up
a
little
of
everything
,
I
dare
say
,
''
said
Mr.
*NL*
Stelling
.
``
They
've
a
great
deal
of
superficial
cleverness
;
but
they
*NL*
could
n't
go
far
into
anything
.
They
're
quick
and
shallow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
,
delighted
with
this
verdict
,
telegraphed
his
triumph
by
wagging
*NL*
his
head
at
Maggie
,
behind
Mr.
Stelling
's
chair
.
As
for
Maggie
,
she
*NL*
had
hardly
ever
been
so
mortified
.
She
had
been
so
proud
to
be
called
*NL*
``
quick
''
all
her
little
life
,
and
now
it
appeared
that
this
quickness
*NL*
was
the
brand
of
inferiority
.
It
would
have
been
better
to
be
slow
,
*NL*
like
Tom
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ha
,
ha
!
Miss
Maggie
!
''
said
Tom
,
when
they
were
alone
;
``
you
see
it
's
*NL*
not
such
a
fine
thing
to
be
quick
.
You
'll
never
go
far
into
anything
,
*NL*
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Maggie
was
so
oppressed
by
this
dreadful
destiny
that
she
had
no
*NL*
spirit
for
a
retort
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
when
this
small
apparatus
of
shallow
quickness
was
fetched
away
in
*NL*
the
gig
by
Luke
,
and
the
study
was
once
more
quite
lonely
for
Tom
,
he
*NL*
missed
her
grievously
.
He
had
really
been
brighter
,
and
had
got
*NL*
through
his
lessons
better
,
since
she
had
been
there
;
and
she
had
*NL*
asked
Mr.
Stelling
so
many
questions
about
the
Roman
Empire
,
and
*NL*
whether
there
really
ever
was
a
man
who
said
,
in
Latin
,
``
I
would
not
*NL*
buy
it
for
a
farthing
or
a
rotten
nut
,
''
or
whether
that
had
only
been
*NL*
turned
into
Latin
,
that
Tom
had
actually
come
to
a
dim
understanding
*NL*
of
the
fact
that
there
had
once
been
people
upon
the
earth
who
were
so
*NL*
fortunate
as
to
know
Latin
without
learning
it
through
the
medium
of
*NL*
the
Eton
Grammar
.
This
luminous
idea
was
a
great
addition
to
his
*NL*
historical
acquirements
during
this
half-year
,
which
were
otherwise
*NL*
confined
to
an
epitomized
history
of
the
Jews
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
dreary
half-year
_
did
_
come
to
an
end
.
How
glad
Tom
was
to
see
*NL*
the
last
yellow
leaves
fluttering
before
the
cold
wind
!
The
dark
*NL*
afternoons
and
the
first
December
snow
seemed
to
him
far
livelier
than
*NL*
the
August
sunshine
;
and
that
he
might
make
himself
the
surer
about
*NL*
the
flight
of
the
days
that
were
carrying
him
homeward
,
he
stuck
*NL*
twenty-one
sticks
deep
in
a
corner
of
the
garden
,
when
he
was
three
*NL*
weeks
from
the
holidays
,
and
pulled
one
up
every
day
with
a
great
*NL*
wrench
,
throwing
it
to
a
distance
with
a
vigor
of
will
which
would
*NL*
have
carried
it
to
limbo
,
if
it
had
been
in
the
nature
of
sticks
to
*NL*
travel
so
far
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
was
worth
purchasing
,
even
at
the
heavy
price
of
the
Latin
*NL*
Grammar
,
the
happiness
of
seeing
the
bright
light
in
the
parlor
at
*NL*
home
,
as
the
gig
passed
noiselessly
over
the
snow-covered
bridge
;
the
*NL*
happiness
of
passing
from
the
cold
air
to
the
warmth
and
the
kisses
*NL*
and
the
smiles
of
that
familiar
hearth
,
where
the
pattern
of
the
rug
*NL*
and
the
grate
and
the
fire-irons
were
``
first
ideas
''
that
it
was
no
*NL*
more
possible
to
criticise
than
the
solidity
and
extension
of
matter
.
*NL*
There
is
no
sense
of
ease
like
the
ease
we
felt
in
those
scenes
where
*NL*
we
were
born
,
where
objects
became
dear
to
us
before
we
had
known
the
*NL*
labor
of
choice
,
and
where
the
outer
world
seemed
only
an
extension
of
*NL*
our
own
personality
;
we
accepted
and
loved
it
as
we
accepted
our
own
*NL*
sense
of
existence
and
our
own
limbs
.
Very
commonplace
,
even
ugly
,
*NL*
that
furniture
of
our
early
home
might
look
if
it
were
put
up
to
*NL*
auction
;
an
improved
taste
in
upholstery
scorns
it
;
and
is
not
the
*NL*
striving
after
something
better
and
better
in
our
surroundings
the
*NL*
grand
characteristic
that
distinguishes
man
from
the
brute
,
or
,
to
*NL*
satisfy
a
scrupulous
accuracy
of
definition
,
that
distinguishes
the
*NL*
British
man
from
the
foreign
brute
?
But
heaven
knows
where
that
*NL*
striving
might
lead
us
,
if
our
affections
had
not
a
trick
of
twining
*NL*
round
those
old
inferior
things
;
if
the
loves
and
sanctities
of
our
*NL*
life
had
no
deep
immovable
roots
in
memory
.
One
's
delight
in
an
*NL*
elderberry
bush
overhanging
the
confused
leafage
of
a
hedgerow
bank
,
*NL*
as
a
more
gladdening
sight
than
the
finest
cistus
or
fuchsia
spreading
*NL*
itself
on
the
softest
undulating
turf
,
is
an
entirely
unjustifiable
*NL*
preference
to
a
nursery-gardener
,
or
to
any
of
those
regulated
minds
*NL*
who
are
free
from
the
weakness
of
any
attachment
that
does
not
rest
on
*NL*
a
demonstrable
superiority
of
qualities
.
And
there
is
no
better
reason
*NL*
for
preferring
this
elderberry
bush
than
that
it
stirs
an
early
*NL*
memory
;
that
it
is
no
novelty
in
my
life
,
speaking
to
me
merely
*NL*
through
my
present
sensibilities
to
form
and
color
,
but
the
long
*NL*
companion
of
my
existence
,
that
wove
itself
into
my
joys
when
joys
*NL*
were
vivid
.

Chapter
II
*NL*
*NL*
The
Christmas
Holidays
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Fine
old
Christmas
,
with
the
snowy
hair
and
ruddy
face
,
had
done
his
*NL*
duty
that
year
in
the
noblest
fashion
,
and
had
set
off
his
rich
gifts
*NL*
of
warmth
and
color
with
all
the
heightening
contrast
of
frost
and
*NL*
snow
.
*NL*
*NL*
Snow
lay
on
the
croft
and
river-bank
in
undulations
softer
than
the
*NL*
limbs
of
infancy
;
it
lay
with
the
neatliest
finished
border
on
every
*NL*
sloping
roof
,
making
the
dark-red
gables
stand
out
with
a
new
depth
of
*NL*
color
;
it
weighed
heavily
on
the
laurels
and
fir-trees
,
till
it
fell
*NL*
from
them
with
a
shuddering
sound
;
it
clothed
the
rough
turnip-field
*NL*
with
whiteness
,
and
made
the
sheep
look
like
dark
blotches
;
the
gates
*NL*
were
all
blocked
up
with
the
sloping
drifts
,
and
here
and
there
a
*NL*
disregarded
four-footed
beast
stood
as
if
petrified
``
in
unrecumbent
*NL*
sadness
''
;
there
was
no
gleam
,
no
shadow
,
for
the
heavens
,
too
,
were
*NL*
one
still
,
pale
cloud
;
no
sound
or
motion
in
anything
but
the
dark
*NL*
river
that
flowed
and
moaned
like
an
unresting
sorrow
.
But
old
*NL*
Christmas
smiled
as
he
laid
this
cruel-seeming
spell
on
the
outdoor
*NL*
world
,
for
he
meant
to
light
up
home
with
new
brightness
,
to
deepen
*NL*
all
the
richness
of
indoor
color
,
and
give
a
keener
edge
of
delight
to
*NL*
the
warm
fragrance
of
food
;
he
meant
to
prepare
a
sweet
imprisonment
*NL*
that
would
strengthen
the
primitive
fellowship
of
kindred
,
and
make
*NL*
the
sunshine
of
familiar
human
faces
as
welcome
as
the
hidden
*NL*
day-star
.
His
kindness
fell
but
hardly
on
the
homeless
,
--
fell
but
*NL*
hardly
on
the
homes
where
the
hearth
was
not
very
warm
,
and
where
the
*NL*
food
had
little
fragrance
;
where
the
human
faces
had
had
no
sunshine
*NL*
in
them
,
but
rather
the
leaden
,
blank-eyed
gaze
of
unexpectant
want
.
*NL*
But
the
fine
old
season
meant
well
;
and
if
he
has
not
learned
the
*NL*
secret
how
to
bless
men
impartially
,
it
is
because
his
father
Time
,
*NL*
with
ever-unrelenting
unrelenting
purpose
,
still
hides
that
secret
in
*NL*
his
own
mighty
,
slow-beating
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
yet
this
Christmas
day
,
in
spite
of
Tom
's
fresh
delight
in
home
,
*NL*
was
not
,
he
thought
,
somehow
or
other
,
quite
so
happy
as
it
had
always
*NL*
been
before
.
The
red
berries
were
just
as
abundant
on
the
holly
,
and
*NL*
he
and
Maggie
had
dressed
all
the
windows
and
mantlepieces
and
*NL*
picture-frames
on
Christmas
eve
with
as
much
taste
as
ever
,
wedding
*NL*
the
thick-set
scarlet
clusters
with
branches
of
the
black-berried
ivy
.
*NL*
There
had
been
singing
under
the
windows
after
midnight
,
--
supernatural
*NL*
singing
,
Maggie
always
felt
,
in
spite
of
Tom
's
contemptuous
insistence
*NL*
that
the
singers
were
old
Patch
,
the
parish
clerk
,
and
the
rest
of
the
*NL*
church
choir
;
she
trembled
with
awe
when
their
carolling
broke
in
upon
*NL*
her
dreams
,
and
the
image
of
men
in
fustian
clothes
was
always
thrust
*NL*
away
by
the
vision
of
angels
resting
on
the
parted
cloud
.
The
midnight
*NL*
chant
had
helped
as
usual
to
lift
the
morning
above
the
level
of
*NL*
common
days
;
and
then
there
were
the
smell
of
hot
toast
and
ale
from
*NL*
the
kitchen
,
at
the
breakfast
hour
;
the
favorite
anthem
,
the
green
*NL*
boughs
,
and
the
short
sermon
gave
the
appropriate
festal
character
to
*NL*
the
church-going
;
and
aunt
and
uncle
Moss
,
with
all
their
seven
*NL*
children
,
were
looking
like
so
many
reflectors
of
the
bright
*NL*
parlor-fire
,
when
the
church-goers
came
back
,
stamping
the
snow
from
*NL*
their
feet
.
The
plum-pudding
was
of
the
same
handsome
roundness
as
*NL*
ever
,
and
came
in
with
the
symbolic
blue
flames
around
it
,
as
if
it
*NL*
had
been
heroically
snatched
from
the
nether
fires
,
into
which
it
had
*NL*
been
thrown
by
dyspeptic
Puritans
;
the
dessert
was
as
splendid
as
*NL*
ever
,
with
its
golden
oranges
,
brown
nuts
,
and
the
crystalline
light
*NL*
and
dark
of
apple-jelly
and
damson
cheese
;
in
all
these
things
*NL*
Christmas
was
as
it
had
always
been
since
Tom
could
remember
;
it
was
*NL*
only
distinguished
,
if
by
anything
,
by
superior
sliding
and
snowballs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Christmas
was
cheery
,
but
not
so
Mr.
Tulliver
.
He
was
irate
and
*NL*
defiant
;
and
Tom
,
though
he
espoused
his
father
's
quarrels
and
shared
*NL*
his
father
's
sense
of
injury
,
was
not
without
some
of
the
feeling
that
*NL*
oppressed
Maggie
when
Mr.
Tulliver
got
louder
and
more
angry
in
*NL*
narration
and
assertion
with
the
increased
leisure
of
dessert
.
The
*NL*
attention
that
Tom
might
have
concentrated
on
his
nuts
and
wine
was
*NL*
distracted
by
a
sense
that
there
were
rascally
enemies
in
the
world
,
*NL*
and
that
the
business
of
grown-up
life
could
hardly
be
conducted
*NL*
without
a
good
deal
of
quarrelling
.
Now
,
Tom
was
not
fond
of
*NL*
quarrelling
,
unless
it
could
soon
be
put
an
end
to
by
a
fair
stand-up
*NL*
fight
with
an
adversary
whom
he
had
every
chance
of
thrashing
;
and
his
*NL*
father
's
irritable
talk
made
him
uncomfortable
,
though
he
never
*NL*
accounted
to
himself
for
the
feeling
,
or
conceived
the
notion
that
his
*NL*
father
was
faulty
in
this
respect
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
particular
embodiment
of
the
evil
principle
now
exciting
Mr.
*NL*
Tulliver
's
determined
resistance
was
Mr.
Pivart
,
who
,
having
lands
*NL*
higher
up
the
Ripple
,
was
taking
measures
for
their
irrigation
,
which
*NL*
either
were
,
or
would
be
,
or
were
bound
to
be
-LRB-
on
the
principle
that
*NL*
water
was
water
-RRB-
,
an
infringement
on
Mr.
Tulliver
's
legitimate
share
*NL*
of
water-power
.
Dix
,
who
had
a
mill
on
the
stream
,
was
a
feeble
*NL*
auxiliary
of
Old
Harry
compared
with
Pivart
.
Dix
had
been
brought
to
*NL*
his
senses
by
arbitration
,
and
Wakem
's
advice
had
not
carried
_
him
_
*NL*
far
.
No
;
Dix
,
Mr.
Tulliver
considered
,
had
been
as
good
as
nowhere
in
*NL*
point
of
law
;
and
in
the
intensity
of
his
indignation
against
Pivart
,
*NL*
his
contempt
for
a
baffled
adversary
like
Dix
began
to
wear
the
air
of
*NL*
a
friendly
attachment
.
He
had
no
male
audience
to-day
except
Mr.
Moss
,
*NL*
who
knew
nothing
,
as
he
said
,
of
the
``
natur
'
o
'
mills
,
''
and
could
only
*NL*
assent
to
Mr.
Tulliver
's
arguments
on
the
_
a
priori
_
ground
of
family
*NL*
relationship
and
monetary
obligation
;
but
Mr.
Tulliver
did
not
talk
*NL*
with
the
futile
intention
of
convincing
his
audience
,
he
talked
to
*NL*
relieve
himself
;
while
good
Mr.
Moss
made
strong
efforts
to
keep
his
*NL*
eyes
wide
open
,
in
spite
of
the
sleepiness
which
an
unusually
good
*NL*
dinner
produced
in
his
hard-worked
frame
.
Mrs.
Moss
,
more
alive
to
the
*NL*
subject
,
and
interested
in
everything
that
affected
her
brother
,
*NL*
listened
and
put
in
a
word
as
often
as
maternal
preoccupations
*NL*
allowed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
Pivart
's
a
new
name
hereabout
,
brother
,
is
n't
it
?
''
she
said
;
``
he
*NL*
did
n't
own
the
land
in
father
's
time
,
nor
yours
either
,
before
I
was
*NL*
married
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
New
name
?
Yes
,
I
should
think
it
_
is
_
a
new
name
,
''
said
Mr.
Tulliver
,
*NL*
with
angry
emphasis
.
``
Dorlcote
Mill
's
been
in
our
family
a
hundred
*NL*
year
and
better
,
and
nobody
ever
heard
of
a
Pivart
meddling
with
the
*NL*
river
,
till
this
fellow
came
and
bought
Bincome
's
farm
out
of
hand
,
*NL*
before
anybody
else
could
so
much
as
say
`
snap
.
'
But
I
'll
_
Pivart
_
*NL*
him
!
''
added
Mr.
Tulliver
,
lifting
his
glass
with
a
sense
that
he
had
*NL*
defined
his
resolution
in
an
unmistakable
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
wo
n't
be
forced
to
go
to
law
with
him
,
I
hope
,
brother
?
''
said
*NL*
Mrs.
Moss
,
with
some
anxiety
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
what
I
shall
be
forced
to
;
but
I
know
what
I
shall
force
*NL*
_
him
_
to
,
with
his
dikes
and
erigations
,
if
there
's
any
law
to
be
*NL*
brought
to
bear
o
'
the
right
side
.
I
know
well
enough
who
's
at
the
*NL*
bottom
of
it
;
he
's
got
Wakem
to
back
him
and
egg
him
on
.
I
know
Wakem
*NL*
tells
him
the
law
ca
n't
touch
him
for
it
,
but
there
's
folks
can
handle
*NL*
the
law
besides
Wakem
.
It
takes
a
big
raskil
to
beat
him
;
but
there
's
*NL*
bigger
to
be
found
,
as
know
more
o
'
th
'
ins
and
outs
o
'
the
law
,
else
*NL*
how
came
Wakem
to
lose
Brumley
's
suit
for
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Tulliver
was
a
strictly
honest
man
,
and
proud
of
being
honest
,
but
*NL*
he
considered
that
in
law
the
ends
of
justice
could
only
be
achieved
*NL*
by
employing
a
stronger
knave
to
frustrate
a
weaker
.
Law
was
a
sort
of
*NL*
cock-fight
,
in
which
it
was
the
business
of
injured
honesty
to
get
a
*NL*
game
bird
with
the
best
pluck
and
the
strongest
spurs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gore
's
no
fool
;
you
need
n't
tell
me
that
,
''
he
observed
presently
,
in
*NL*
a
pugnacious
tone
,
as
if
poor
Gritty
had
been
urging
that
lawyer
's
*NL*
capabilities
;
``
but
,
you
see
,
he
is
n't
up
to
the
law
as
Wakem
is
.
And
*NL*
water
's
a
very
particular
thing
;
you
ca
n't
pick
it
up
with
a
*NL*
pitchfork
.
That
's
why
it
's
been
nuts
to
Old
Harry
and
the
lawyers
.
*NL*
It
's
plain
enough
what
's
the
rights
and
the
wrongs
of
water
,
if
you
*NL*
look
at
it
straight-forrard
;
for
a
river
's
a
river
,
and
if
you
've
got
*NL*
a
mill
,
you
must
have
water
to
turn
it
;
and
it
's
no
use
telling
me
*NL*
Pivart
's
erigation
and
nonsense
wo
n't
stop
my
wheel
;
I
know
what
*NL*
belongs
to
water
better
than
that
.
Talk
to
me
o
'
what
th
'
engineers
*NL*
say
!
I
say
it
's
common
sense
,
as
Pivart
's
dikes
must
do
me
an
injury
.
*NL*
But
if
that
's
their
engineering
,
I
'll
put
Tom
to
it
by-and-by
,
and
he
*NL*
shall
see
if
he
ca
n't
find
a
bit
more
sense
in
th
'
engineering
*NL*
business
than
what
_
that
_
comes
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
,
looking
round
with
some
anxiety
at
this
announcement
of
his
*NL*
prospects
,
unthinkingly
withdrew
a
small
rattle
he
was
amusing
baby
*NL*
Moss
with
,
whereupon
she
,
being
a
baby
that
knew
her
own
mind
with
*NL*
remarkable
clearness
,
instantaneously
expressed
her
sentiments
in
a
*NL*
piercing
yell
,
and
was
not
to
be
appeased
even
by
the
restoration
of
*NL*
the
rattle
,
feeling
apparently
that
the
original
wrong
of
having
it
*NL*
taken
from
her
remained
in
all
its
force
.
Mrs.
Moss
hurried
away
with
*NL*
her
into
another
room
,
and
expressed
to
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
who
accompanied
*NL*
her
,
the
conviction
that
the
dear
child
had
good
reasons
for
crying
;
*NL*
implying
that
if
it
was
supposed
to
be
the
rattle
that
baby
clamored
*NL*
for
,
she
was
a
misunderstood
baby
.
The
thoroughly
justifiable
yell
*NL*
being
quieted
,
Mrs.
Moss
looked
at
her
sister-in-law
and
said
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sorry
to
see
brother
so
put
out
about
this
water
work
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
your
brother
's
way
,
Mrs.
Moss
;
I
'd
never
anything
o
'
that
sort
*NL*
before
I
was
married
,
''
said
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
with
a
half-implied
*NL*
reproach
.
She
always
spoke
of
her
husband
as
``
your
brother
''
to
Mrs.
*NL*
Moss
in
any
case
when
his
line
of
conduct
was
not
matter
of
pure
*NL*
admiration
.
Amiable
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
who
was
never
angry
in
her
life
,
*NL*
had
yet
her
mild
share
of
that
spirit
without
which
she
could
hardly
*NL*
have
been
at
once
a
Dodson
and
a
woman
.
Being
always
on
the
defensive
*NL*
toward
her
own
sisters
,
it
was
natural
that
she
should
be
keenly
*NL*
conscious
of
her
superiority
,
even
as
the
weakest
Dodson
,
over
a
*NL*
husband
's
sister
,
who
,
besides
being
poorly
off
,
and
inclined
to
``
hang
*NL*
on
''
her
brother
,
had
the
good-natured
submissiveness
of
a
large
,
*NL*
easy-tempered
,
untidy
,
prolific
woman
,
with
affection
enough
in
her
*NL*
not
only
for
her
own
husband
and
abundant
children
,
but
for
any
number
*NL*
of
collateral
relations
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
and
pray
he
wo
n't
go
to
law
,
''
said
Mrs.
Moss
,
``
for
there
's
*NL*
never
any
knowing
where
that
'll
end
.
And
the
right
does
n't
allays
win
.
*NL*
This
Mr.
Pivart
's
a
rich
man
,
by
what
I
can
make
out
,
and
the
rich
*NL*
mostly
get
things
their
own
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
to
that
,
''
said
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
stroking
her
dress
down
,
``
I
've
seen
*NL*
what
riches
are
in
my
own
family
;
for
my
sisters
have
got
husbands
as
*NL*
can
afford
to
do
pretty
much
what
they
like
.
But
I
think
sometimes
I
*NL*
shall
be
drove
off
my
head
with
the
talk
about
this
law
and
erigation
;
*NL*
and
my
sisters
lay
all
the
fault
to
me
,
for
they
do
n't
know
what
it
is
*NL*
to
marry
a
man
like
your
brother
;
how
should
they
?
Sister
Pullet
has
*NL*
her
own
way
from
morning
till
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

''
said
Mrs.
Moss
,
``
I
do
n't
think
I
should
like
my
husband

he
*NL*
had
n't
got
any
wits
of
his
own
,
and
I
had
to
find
head-piece
for
him
.
*NL*
It
's
a
deal
easier
to
do
what
pleases
one
's
husband
,
than
to
be
*NL*
puzzling
what
else
one
should
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
people
come
to
talk
o

doing
what
pleases
their
husbands
,
''
said
*NL*
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
with
a
faint
imitation
of
her
sister
Glegg
,
``
I
'm
sure
*NL*
your
brother
might
have
waited
a
long
while
before
he
'd
have
found
a
*NL*
wife
that
`
ud
have
let
him
have
his
say
in
everything
,
as
I
do
.
It
's
*NL*
nothing
but
law
and
erigation
now
,
from
when
we
first
get
up
in
the
*NL*
morning
till
we
go
to
bed
at
night
;
and
I
never
contradict
him
;
I
only
*NL*
say
,
`
Well
,
Mr.
Tulliver
,
do
as
you
like
;
but
whativer
you
do
,
do
n't
*NL*
go
to
law
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
as
we
have
seen
,
was
not
without
influence
over
her
*NL*
husband
.
No
woman
is
;
she
can
always
incline
him
to
do
either
what
she
*NL*
wishes
,
or
the
reverse
;
and
on
the
composite
impulses
that
were
*NL*
threatening
to
hurry
Mr.
Tulliver
into
``
law
,
''
Mrs.
Tulliver
's
*NL*
monotonous
pleading
had
doubtless
its
share
of
force
;
it
might
even
be
*NL*
comparable
to
that
proverbial
feather
which
has
the
credit
or
*NL*
discredit
of
breaking
the
camel
's
back
;
though
,
on
a
strictly
*NL*
impartial
view
,
the
blame
ought
rather
to
lie
with
the
previous
weight
*NL*
of
feathers
which
had
already
placed
the
back
in
such
imminent
peril
*NL*
that
an
otherwise
innocent
feather
could
not
settle
on
it
without
*NL*
mischief
.
Not
that
Mrs.
Tulliver
's
feeble
beseeching
could
have
had
*NL*
this
feather
's
weight
in
virtue
of
her
single
personality
;
but
*NL*
whenever
she
departed
from
entire
assent
to
her
husband
,
he
saw
in
her
*NL*
the
representative
of
the
Dodson
family
;
and
it
was
a
guiding
*NL*
principle
with
Mr.
Tulliver
to
let
the
Dodsons
know
that
they
were
not
*NL*
to
domineer
over
_
him
_
,
or
--
more
specifically
--
that
a
male
Tulliver
*NL*
was
far
more
than
equal
to
four
female
Dodsons
,
even
though
one
of
*NL*
them
was
Mrs.
Glegg
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
not
even
a
direct
argument
from
that
typical
Dodson
female
herself
*NL*
against
his
going
to
law
could
have
heightened
his
disposition
toward
*NL*
it
so
much
as
the
mere
thought
of
Wakem
,
continually
freshened
by
the
*NL*
sight
of
the
too
able
attorney
on
market-days
.
Wakem
,
to
his
certain
*NL*
knowledge
,
was
-LRB-
metaphorically
speaking
-RRB-
at
the
bottom
of
Pivart
's
*NL*
irrigation
;
Wakem
had
tried
to
make
Dix
stand
out
,
and
go
to
law
about
*NL*
the
dam
;
it
was
unquestionably
Wakem
who
had
caused
Mr.
Tulliver
to
*NL*
lose
the
suit
about
the
right
of
road
and
the
bridge
that
made
a
*NL*
thoroughfare
of
his
land
for
every
vagabond
who
preferred
an
*NL*
opportunity
of
damaging
private
property
to
walking
like
an
honest
man
*NL*
along
the
highroad
;
all
lawyers
were
more
or
less
rascals
,
but
Wakem
's
*NL*
rascality
was
of
that
peculiarly
aggravated
kind
which
placed
itself
*NL*
in
opposition
to
that
form
of
right
embodied
in
Mr.
Tulliver
's
*NL*
interests
and
opinions
.
And
as
an
extra
touch
of
bitterness
,
the
*NL*
injured
miller
had
recently
,
in
borrowing
the
five
hundred
pounds
,
*NL*
been
obliged
to
carry
a
little
business
to
Wakem
's
office
on
his
own
*NL*
account
.
A
hook-nosed
glib
fellow
!
as
cool
as
a
cucumber
,
--
always
*NL*
looking
so
sure
of
his
game
!
And
it
was
vexatious
that
Lawyer
Gore
was
*NL*
not
more
like
him
,
but
was
a
bald
,
round-featured
man
,
with
bland
*NL*
manners
and
fat
hands
;
a
game-cock
that
you
would
be
rash
to
bet
upon
*NL*
against
Wakem
.
Gore
was
a
sly
fellow
.
His
weakness
did
not
lie
on
the
*NL*
side
of
scrupulosity
;
but
the
largest
amount
of
winking
,
however
*NL*
significant
,
is
not
equivalent
to
seeing
through
a
stone
wall
;
and
*NL*
confident
as
Mr.
Tulliver
was
in
his
principle
that
water
was
water
,
*NL*
and
in
the
direct
inference
that
Pivart
had
not
a
leg
to
stand
on
in
*NL*
this
affair
of
irrigation
,
he
had
an
uncomfortable
suspicion
that
*NL*
Wakem
had
more
law
to
show
against
this
-LRB-
rationally
-RRB-
irrefragable
*NL*
inference
than
Gore
could
show
for
it
.
But
then
,
if
they
went
to
law
,
*NL*
there
was
a
chance
for
Mr.
Tulliver
to
employ
Counsellor
Wylde
on
his
*NL*
side
,
instead
of
having
that
admirable
bully
against
him
;
and
the
*NL*
prospect
of
seeing
a
witness
of
Wakem
's
made
to
perspire
and
become
*NL*
confounded
,
as
Mr.
Tulliver
's
witness
had
once
been
,
was
alluring
to
*NL*
the
love
of
retributive
justice
.
*NL*
*NL*
Much
rumination
had
Mr.
Tulliver
on
these
puzzling
subjects
during
his
*NL*
rides
on
the
gray
horse
;
much
turning
of
the
head
from
side
to
side
,
*NL*
as
the
scales
dipped
alternately
;
but
the
probable
result
was
still
*NL*
out
of
sight
,
only
to
be
reached
through
much
hot
argument
and
*NL*
iteration
in
domestic
and
social
life
.
That
initial
stage
of
the
*NL*
dispute
which
consisted
in
the
narration
of
the
case
and
the
*NL*
enforcement
of
Mr.
Tulliver
's
views
concerning
it
throughout
the
*NL*
entire
circle
of
his
connections
would
necessarily
take
time
;
and
at
*NL*
the
beginning
of
February
,
when
Tom
was
going
to
school
again
,
there
*NL*
were
scarcely
any
new
items
to
be
detected
in
his
father
's
statement
*NL*
of
the
case
against
Pivart
,
or
any
more
specific
indication
of
the
*NL*
measures
he
was
bent
on
taking
against
that
rash
contravener
of
the
*NL*
principle
that
water
was
water
.
Iteration
,
like
friction
,
is
likely
to
*NL*
generate
heat
instead
of
progress
,
and
Mr.
Tulliver
's
heat
was
*NL*
certainly
more
and
more
palpable
.
If
there
had
been
no
new
evidence
on
*NL*
any
other
point
,
there
had
been
new
evidence
that
Pivart
was
as
``
thick
*NL*
as
mud
''
with
Wakem
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Father
,
''
said
Tom
,
one
evening
near
the
end
of
the
holidays
,
``
uncle
*NL*
Glegg
says
Lawyer
Wakem
_
is
_
going
to
send
his
son
to
Mr.
Stelling
.
It
*NL*
is
n't
true
,
what
they
said
about
his
going
to
be
sent
to
France
.
You
*NL*
wo
n't
like
me
to
go
to
school
with
Wakem
's
son
,
shall
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
no
matter
for
that
,
my
boy
,
''
said
Mr.
Tulliver
;
``
do
n't
you
learn
*NL*
anything
bad
of
him
,
that
's
all
.
The
lad
's
a
poor
deformed
creatur
,
*NL*
and
takes
after
his
mother
in
the
face
;
I
think
there
is
n't
much
of
*NL*
his
father
in
him
.
It
's
a
sign
Wakem
thinks
high
o
'
Mr.
Sterling
,
as
*NL*
he
sends
his
son
to
him
,
and
Wakem
knows
meal
from
bran
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Tulliver
in
his
heart
was
rather
proud
of
the
fact
that
his
son
*NL*
was
to
have
the
same
advantages
as
Wakem
's
;
but
Tom
was
not
at
all
*NL*
easy
on
the
point
.
It
would
have
been
much
clearer
if
the
lawyer
's
son
*NL*
had
not
been
deformed
,
for
then
Tom
would
have
had
the
prospect
of
*NL*
pitching
into
him
with
all
that
freedom
which
is
derived
from
a
high
*NL*
moral
sanction
.

Chapter
III
*NL*
*NL*
The
New
Schoolfellow
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
cold
,
wet
January
day
on
which
Tom
went
back
to
school
;
a
day
*NL*
quite
in
keeping
with
this
severe
phase
of
his
destiny
.
If
he
had
not
*NL*
carried
in
his
pocket
a
parcel
of
sugar-candy
and
a
small
Dutch
doll
*NL*
for
little
Laura
,
there
would
have
been
no
ray
of
expected
pleasure
to
*NL*
enliven
the
general
gloom
.
But
he
liked
to
think
how
Laura
would
put
*NL*
out
her
lips
and
her
tiny
hands
for
the
bits
of
sugarcandy
;
and
to
*NL*
give
the
greater
keenness
to
these
pleasures
of
imagination
,
he
took
*NL*
out
the
parcel
,
made
a
small
hole
in
the
paper
,
and
bit
off
a
crystal
*NL*
or
two
,
which
had
so
solacing
an
effect
under
the
confined
prospect
*NL*
and
damp
odors
of
the
gig-umbrella
,
that
he
repeated
the
process
more
*NL*
than
once
on
his
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Tulliver
,
we
're
glad
to
see
you
again
,
''
said
Mr.
Stelling
,
*NL*
heartily
.
``
Take
off
your
wrappings
and
come
into
the
study
till
*NL*
dinner
.
You
'll
find
a
bright
fire
there
,
and
a
new
companion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
felt
in
an
uncomfortable
flutter
as
he
took
off
his
woollen
*NL*
comforter
and
other
wrappings
.
He
had
seen
Philip
Wakem
at
St.
Ogg
's
,
*NL*
but
had
always
turned
his
eyes
away
from
him
as
quickly
as
possible
.
*NL*
He
would
have
disliked
having
a
deformed
boy
for
his
companion
,
even
*NL*
if
Philip
had
not
been
the
son
of
a
bad
man
.
And
Tom
did
not
see
how
a
*NL*
bad
man
's
son
could
be
very
good
.
His
own
father
was
a
good
man
,
and
*NL*
he
would
readily
have
fought
any
one
who
said
the
contrary
.
He
was
in
*NL*
a
state
of
mingled
embarrassment
and
defiance
as
he
followed
Mr.
*NL*
Stelling
to
the
study
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
is
a
new
companion
for
you
to
shake
hands
with
,
Tulliver
,
''
said
*NL*
that
gentleman
on
entering
the
study
,
--
``
Master
Philip
Wakem
.
I
shall
*NL*
leave
you
to
make
acquaintance
by
yourselves
.
You
already
know
*NL*
something
of
each
other
,
I
imagine
;
for
you
are
neighbors
at
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
looked
confused
and
awkward
,
while
Philip
rose
and
glanced
at
him
*NL*
timidly
.
Tom
did
not
like
to
go
up
and
put
out
his
hand
,
and
he
was
*NL*
not
prepared
to
say
,
``
How
do
you
do
?
''
on
so
short
a
notice
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Stelling
wisely
turned
away
,
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
;
boys
'
*NL*
shyness
only
wears
off
in
the
absence
of
their
elders
.
*NL*
*NL*
Philip
was
at
once
too
proud
and
too
timid
to
walk
toward
Tom
.
He
*NL*
thought
,
or
rather
felt
,
that
Tom
had
an
aversion
to
looking
at
him
;
*NL*
every
one
,
almost
,
disliked
looking
at
him
;
and
his
deformity
was
more
*NL*
conspicuous
when
he
walked
.
So
they
remained
without
shaking
hands
or
*NL*
even
speaking
,
while
Tom
went
to
the
fire
and
warmed
himself
,
every
*NL*
now
and
then
casting
furtive
glances
at
Philip
,
who
seemed
to
be
*NL*
drawing
absently
first
one
object
and
then
another
on
a
piece
of
paper
*NL*
he
had
before
him
.
He
had
seated
himself
again
,
and
as
he
drew
,
was
*NL*
thinking
what
he
could
say
to
Tom
,
and
trying
to
overcome
his
own
*NL*
repugnance
to
making
the
first
advances
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
began
to
look
oftener
and
longer
at
Philip
's
face
,
for
he
could
*NL*
see
it
without
noticing
the
hump
,
and
it
was
really
not
a
disagreeable
*NL*
face
,
--
very
old-looking
,
Tom
thought
.
He
wondered
how
much
older
*NL*
Philip
was
than
himself
.
An
anatomist
--
even
a
mere
physiognomist
--
*NL*
would
have
seen
that
the
deformity
of
Philip
's
spine
was
not
a
*NL*
congenital
hump
,
but
the
result
of
an
accident
in
infancy
;
but
you
*NL*
do
not
expect
from
Tom
any
acquaintance
with
such
distinctions
;
*NL*
to
him
,
Philip
was
simply
a
humpback
.
He
had
a
vague
notion
*NL*
that
the
deformity
of
Wakem
's
son
had
some
relation
to
the
lawyer
's
*NL*
rascality
,
of
which
he
had
so
often
heard
his
father
talk
with
hot
*NL*
emphasis
;
and
he
felt
,
too
,
a
half-admitted
fear
of
him
as
probably
*NL*
a
spiteful
fellow
,
who
,
not
being
able
to
fight
you
,
had
cunning
*NL*
ways
of
doing
you
a
mischief
by
the
sly
.
There
was
a
humpbacked
*NL*
tailor
in
the
neighborhood
of
Mr.
Jacobs
's
academy
,
who
was
considered
*NL*
a
very
unamiable
character
,
and
was
much
hooted
after
by
public-spirited
*NL*
boys
solely
on
the
ground
of
his
unsatisfactory
moral
qualities
;
so
*NL*
that
Tom
was
not
without
a
basis
of
fact
to
go
upon
.
Still
,
no
face
*NL*
could
be
more
unlike
that
ugly
tailor
's
than
this
melancholy
boy
's
*NL*
face
,
--
the
brown
hair
round
it
waved
and
curled
at
the
ends
like
a
*NL*
girl
's
;
Tom
thought
that
truly
pitiable
.
This
Wakem
was
a
pale
,
*NL*
puny
fellow
,
and
it
was
quite
clear
he
would
not
be
able
to
play
at
*NL*
anything
worth
speaking
of
;
but
he
handled
his
pencil
in
an
enviable
*NL*
manner
,
and
was
apparently
making
one
thing
after
another
without
*NL*
any
trouble
.
What
was
he
drawing
?
Tom
was
quite
warm
now
,
and
wanted
*NL*
something
new
to
be
going
forward
.
It
was
certainly
more
agreeable
*NL*
to
have
an
ill-natured
humpback
as
a
companion
than
to
stand
looking
*NL*
out
of
the
study
window
at
the
rain
,
and
kicking
his
foot
against
*NL*
the
washboard
in
solitude
;
something
would
happen
every
day
,
--
*NL*
``
a
quarrel
or
something
''
;
and
Tom
thought
he
should
rather
like
to
*NL*
show
Philip
that
he
had
better
not
try
his
spiteful
tricks
on
_
him
_
.
*NL*
He
suddenly
walked
across
the
hearth
and
looked
over
Philip
's
paper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
that
's
a
donkey
with
panniers
,
and
a
spaniel
,
and
partridges
in
*NL*
the
corn
!
''
he
exclaimed
,
his
tongue
being
completely
loosed
by
*NL*
surprise
and
admiration
.
``
Oh
my
buttons
!
I
wish
I
could
draw
like
*NL*
that
.
I
'm
to
learn
drawing
this
half
;
I
wonder
if
I
shall
learn
to
*NL*
make
dogs
and
donkeys
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
can
do
them
without
learning
,
''
said
Philip
;
``
I
never
learned
*NL*
drawing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
learned
?
''
said
Tom
,
in
amazement
.
``
Why
,
when
I
make
dogs
and
*NL*
horses
,
and
those
things
,
the
heads
and
the
legs
wo
n't
come
right
;
*NL*
though
I
can
see
how
they
ought
to
be
very
well
.
I
can
make
houses
,
*NL*
and
all
sorts
of
chimneys
,
--
chimneys
going
all
down
the
wall
,
--
and
*NL*
windows
in
the
roof
,
and
all
that
.
But
I
dare
say
I
could
do
dogs
and
*NL*
horses
if
I
was
to
try
more
,
''
he
added
,
reflecting
that
Philip
might
*NL*
falsely
suppose
that
he
was
going
to
``
knock
under
,
''
if
he
were
too
*NL*
frank
about
the
imperfection
of
his
accomplishments
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
''
said
Philip
,
``
it
's
very
easy
.
You
've
only
to
look
well
at
*NL*
things
,
and
draw
them
over
and
over
again
.
What
you
do
wrong
once
,
you
*NL*
can
alter
the
next
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
have
n't
you
been
taught
_
any_thing
?
''
said
Tom
,
beginning
to
have
*NL*
a
puzzled
suspicion
that
Philip
's
crooked
back
might
be
the
source
of
*NL*
remarkable
faculties
.
``
I
thought
you
'd
been
to
school
a
long
while
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Philip
,
smiling
;
``
I
've
been
taught
Latin
and
Greek
and
*NL*
mathematics
,
and
writing
and
such
things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
but
I
say
,
you
do
n't
like
Latin
,
though
,
do
you
?
''
said
Tom
,
*NL*
lowering
his
voice
confidentially
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pretty
well
;
I
do
n't
care
much
about
it
,
''
said
Philip
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
but
perhaps
you
have
n't
got
into
the
_
Propria
quae
maribus
_
,
''
said
*NL*
Tom
,
nodding
his
head
sideways
,
as
much
as
to
say
,
``
that
was
the
test
;
*NL*
it
was
easy
talking
till
you
came
to
_
that
_
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Philip
felt
some
bitter
complacency
in
the
promising
stupidity
of
this
*NL*
well-made
,
active-looking
boy
;
but
made
polite
by
his
own
extreme
*NL*
sensitiveness
,
as
well
as
by
his
desire
to
conciliate
,
he
checked
his
*NL*
inclination
to
laugh
,
and
said
quietly
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
done
with
the
grammar
;
I
do
n't
learn
that
any
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
wo
n't
have
the
same
lessons
as
I
shall
?
''
said
Tom
,
with
a
*NL*
sense
of
disappointment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
but
I
dare
say
I
can
help
you

I
shall
be
very
glad
to
help
you
*NL*
if
I
can
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
did
not
say
``
Thank
you
,
''
for
he
was
quite
absorbed
in
the
thought
*NL*
that
Wakem
's
son
did
not
seem
so
spiteful
a
fellow
as
might
have
been
*NL*
expected
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
,
''
he
said
presently
,
``
do
you
love
your
father
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Philip
,
coloring
deeply
;
``
do
n't
you
love
yours
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
--
I
only
wanted
to
know
,
''
said
Tom
,
rather
ashamed
of
himself
,
*NL*
now
he
saw
Philip
coloring
and
looking
uncomfortable
.
He
found
much
*NL*
difficulty
in
adjusting
his
attitude
of
mind
toward
the
son
of
Lawyer
*NL*
Wakem
,
and
it
had
occurred
to
him
that
if
Philip
disliked
his
father
,
*NL*
that
fact
might
go
some
way
toward
clearing
up
his
perplexity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
you
learn
drawing
now
?
''
he
said
,
by
way
of
changing
the
*NL*
subject
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Philip
.
``
My
father
wishes
me
to
give
all
my
time
to
other
*NL*
things
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
Latin
and
Euclid
,
and
those
things

''
said
Tom
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Philip
,
who
had
left
off
using
his
pencil
,
and
was
resting
*NL*
his
head
on
one
hand
,
while
Tom
was
learning
forward
on
both
elbows
,
*NL*
and
looking
with
increasing
admiration
at
the
dog
and
the
donkey
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
do
n't
mind
that
?
''
said
Tom
,
with
strong
curiosity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
I
like
to
know
what

should

Tom

said
Tom
,
who
had
often
thought
he
should
like
to
resemble
Sir

John
Crake
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
learned
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

I
can
do
that
,
then

''
said
Tom
,
not
with
any
epigrammatic
*NL*
intention
,
but
with
serious
satisfaction
at
the
idea
that
,
as
far
as
*NL*
Latin
was
concerned
,
there
was
no
hindrance
to
his
resembling
Sir
John
*NL*
Crake
.

Only
you

Philip

unable
to
choke
a

very
fond

-LRB-
Philip
,
you
perceive
,
was
not
without
a
wish
to
impress
the
*NL*
well-made
barbarian
with
a
sense
of
his
mental
superiority

who
saw
a

in

this
direction

``
Is
there
anything
like
David

like

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

there
are
very
fine

about

jumping
away

he
added
,
pausing
in

with
a
sudden

lest
the

might
be

``

''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
,
in
his
turn
,
wished
to
make
the
balance
dip
in
his
favor
.
This
*NL*
hunchback
must
not
suppose
that
his
acquaintance
with
fighting
stories
*NL*
put
him
on
a
par
with
an
actual
fighting
hero
,
like
Tom
Tulliver
.
*NL*
Philip
winced
under
this
allusion
to
his
unfitness
for
active
sports
,
*NL*
and
he
answered
almost
peevishly
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
bear
fishing

I
think
people
look
like
fools
sitting
watching
*NL*
a
line
hour
after

,
or
else
throwing
and
throwing
,
and
catching
*NL*
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
but
you
would
n't
say
they
looked
like
fools
when
they
landed
a
*NL*
big
pike
,
I
can
tell
you
,
''
said
Tom
,
who
had
never
caught
anything
*NL*
that
was
``
big
''
in
his
life
,
but
whose
imagination
was
on
the
stretch
*NL*
with
indignant
zeal
for
the
honor
of
sport
.
Wakem
's
son
,
it
was
plain
,
*NL*
had
his
disagreeable
points
,
and
must
be
kept
in
due
check
.
Happily
*NL*
for
the
harmony
of
this
first
interview
,
they
were
now
called
to
*NL*
dinner
,
and
Philip
was
not
allowed
to
develop
farther
his
unsound
*NL*
views
on
the
subject
of
fishing
.
But
Tom
said
to
himself
,
that
was
*NL*
just
what
he
should
have
expected
from
a
hunchback

Chapter
IV
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Young
Idea
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
alterations
of
feeling
in
that
first
dialogue
between
Tom
and
*NL*
Philip
continued
to
make
their
intercourse
even
after
many
weeks
of
*NL*
schoolboy
intimacy
.
Tom
never
quite
lost
the
feeling
that
Philip
,
*NL*
being
the
son
of
a
``
rascal
,
''
was
his
natural
enemy
;
never
thoroughly
*NL*
overcame
his
repulsion
to
Philip
's
deformity
.
He
was
a
boy
who
adhered
*NL*
tenaciously
to
impressions
once
received
;
as
with
all
minds
in
which
*NL*
mere
perception
predominates
over
thought
and
emotion
,
the
external
*NL*
remained
to
him
rigidly
what
it
was
in
the
first
instance
.
But
then
it
*NL*
was
impossible
not
to
like
Philip
's
company
when
he
was
in
a
good
*NL*
humor
;
he
could
help
one
so
well
in
one
's
Latin
exercises
,
which
Tom
*NL*
regarded
as
a
kind
of
puzzle
that
could
only
be
found
out
by
a
lucky
*NL*
chance
;
and
he
could
tell
such
wonderful
fighting
stories
about
Hal
of
*NL*
the
Wynd
,
for
example
,
and
other
heroes
who
were
especial
favorites
*NL*
with
Tom
,
because
they
laid
about
them
with
heavy
strokes
.
He
had
*NL*
small
opinion
of
Saladin
,
whose
cimeter
could
cut
a
cushion
in
two
in
*NL*
an
instant
;
who
wanted
to
cut
cushions
?
That
was
a
stupid
story
,
and
*NL*
he
did
n't
care
to
hear
it
again
.
But
when
Robert
Bruce
,
on
the
black
*NL*
pony
,
rose
in
his
stirrups
,
and
lifting
his
good
battle-axe
,
cracked
*NL*
at
once
the
helmet
and
the
skull
of
the
too
hasty
knight
at
*NL*
Bannockburn
,
then
Tom
felt
all
the
exaltation
of
sympathy
,
and
if
he
*NL*
had
had
a
cocoanut
at
hand
,
he
would
have
cracked
it
at
once
with
the
*NL*
poker
.
Philip
in
his
happier
moods
indulged
Tom
to
the
top
of
his
*NL*
bent
,
heightening
the
crash
and
bang
and
fury
of
every
fight
with
all
*NL*
the
artillery
of
epithets
and
similes
at
his
command
.
But
he
was
not
*NL*
always
in
a
good
humor
or
happy
mood
.
The
slight
spurt
of
peevish
*NL*
susceptibility
which
had
escaped
him
in
their
first
interview
was
a
*NL*
symptom
of
a
perpetually
recurring
mental
ailment
,
half
of
it
nervous
*NL*
irritability
,
half
of
it
the
heart-bitterness
produced
by
the
sense
of
*NL*
his
deformity
.
In
these
fits
of
susceptibility
every
glance
seemed
to
*NL*
him
to
be
charged
either
with
offensive
pity
or
with
ill-repressed
*NL*
disgust
;
at
the
very
least
it
was
an
indifferent
glance
,
and
Philip
*NL*
felt
indifference
as
a
child
of
the
south
feels
the
chill
air
of
a
*NL*
northern
spring
.
Poor
Tom
's
blundering
patronage
when
they
were
out
of
*NL*
doors
together
would
sometimes
make
him
turn
upon
the
well-meaning
lad
*NL*
quite
savagely
;
and
his
eyes
,
usually
sad
and
quiet
,
would
flash
with
*NL*
anything
but
playful
lightning
.
No
wonder
Tom
retained
his
suspicions
*NL*
of
the
humpback
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Philip
's
self-taught
skill
in
drawing
was
another
link
between
*NL*
them
;
for
Tom
found
,
to
his
disgust
,
that
his
new
drawing-master
gave
*NL*
him
no
dogs
and
donkeys
to
draw
,
but
brooks
and
rustic
bridges
and
*NL*
ruins
,
all
with
a
general
softness
of
black-lead
surface
,
indicating
*NL*
that
nature
,
if
anything
,
was
rather
satiny
;
and
as
Tom
's
feeling
for
*NL*
the
picturesque
in
landscape
was
at
present
quite
latent
,
it
is
not
*NL*
surprising
that
Mr.
Goodrich
's
productions
seemed
to
him
an
*NL*
uninteresting
form
of
art
.
Mr.
Tulliver
,
having
a
vague
intention
that
*NL*
Tom
should
be
put
to
some
business
which
included
the
drawing
out
of
*NL*
plans
and
maps
,
had
complained
to
Mr.
Riley
,
when
he
saw
him
at
*NL*
Mudport
,
that
Tom
seemed
to
be
learning
nothing
of
that
sort
;
*NL*
whereupon
that
obliging
adviser
had
suggested
that
Tom
should
have
*NL*
drawing-lessons
.
Mr.
Tulliver
must
not
mind
paying
extra
for
drawing
;
*NL*
let
Tom
be
made
a
good
draughtsman
,
and
he
would
be
able
to
turn
his
*NL*
pencil
to
any
purpose
.
So
it
was
ordered
that
Tom
should
have
*NL*
drawing-lessons
;
and
whom
should
Mr.
Stelling
have
selected
as
a
*NL*
master
if
not
Mr.
Goodrich
,
who
was
considered
quite
at
the
head
of
*NL*
his
profession
within
a
circuit
of
twelve
miles
round
King
's
Lorton
?
*NL*
By
which
means
Tom
learned
to
make
an
extremely
fine
point
to
his
*NL*
pencil
,
and
to
represent
landscape
with
a
``
broad
generality
,
''
which
,
*NL*
doubtless
from
a
narrow
tendency
in
his
mind
to
details
,
he
thought
*NL*
extremely
dull
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
,
you
remember
,
happened
in
those
dark
ages
when
there
were
no
*NL*
schools
of
design
;
before
schoolmasters
were
invariably
men
of
*NL*
scrupulous
integrity
,
and
before
the
clergy
were
all
men
of
enlarged
*NL*
minds
and
varied
culture
.
In
those
less
favored
days
,
it
is
no
fable
*NL*
that
there
were
other
clergymen
besides
Mr.
Stelling
who
had
narrow
*NL*
intellects
and
large
wants
,
and
whose
income
,
by
a
logical
confusion
*NL*
to
which
Fortune
,
being
a
female
as
well
as
blindfold
,
is
peculiarly
*NL*
liable
,
was
proportioned
not
to
their
wants
but
to
their
intellect
,
*NL*
with
which
income
has
clearly
no
inherent
relation
.
The
problem
these
*NL*
gentlemen
had
to
solve
was
to
readjust
the
proportion
between
their
*NL*
wants
and
their
income
;
and
since
wants
are
not
easily
starved
to
*NL*
death
,
the
simpler
method
appeared
to
be
to
raise
their
income
.
There
*NL*
was
but
one
way
of
doing
this
;
any
of
those
low
callings
in
which
men
*NL*
are
obliged
to
do
good
work
at
a
low
price
were
forbidden
to
*NL*
clergymen
;
was
it
their
fault
if
their
only
resource
was
to
turn
out
*NL*
very
poor
work
at
a
high
price
?
Besides
,
how
should
Mr.
Stelling
be
*NL*
expected
to
know
that
education
was
a
delicate
and
difficult
business
,
*NL*
any
more
than
an
animal
endowed
with
a
power
of
boring
a
hole
through
*NL*
a
rock
should
be
expected
to
have
wide
views
of
excavation
?
Mr.
*NL*
Stelling
's
faculties
had
been
early
trained
to
boring
in
a
straight
*NL*
line
,
and
he
had
no
faculty
to
spare
.
But
among
Tom
's
contemporaries
,
*NL*
whose
fathers
cast
their
sons
on
clerical
instruction
to
find
them
*NL*
ignorant
after
many
days
,
there
were
many
far
less
lucky
than
Tom
*NL*
Tulliver
.
Education
was
almost
entirely
a
matter
of
luck
--
usually
of
*NL*
ill-luck
--
in
those
distant
days
.
The
state
of
mind
in
which
you
take
a
*NL*
billiard-cue
or
a
dice-box
in
your
hand
is
one
of
sober
certainty
*NL*
compared
with
that
of
old-fashioned
fathers
,
like
Mr.
Tulliver
,
when
*NL*
they
selected
a
school
or
a
tutor
for
their
sons
.
Excellent
men
,
who
*NL*
had
been
forced
all
their
lives
to
spell
on
an
impromptu-phonetic
*NL*
system
,
and
having
carried
on
a
successful
business
in
spite
of
this
*NL*
disadvantage
,
had
acquired
money
enough
to
give
their
sons
a
better
*NL*
start
in
life
than
they
had
had
themselves
,
must
necessarily
take
*NL*
their
chance
as
to
the
conscience
and
the
competence
of
the
*NL*
schoolmaster
whose
circular
fell
in
their
way
,
and
appeared
to
promise
*NL*
so
much
more
than
they
would
ever
have
thought
of
asking
for
,
*NL*
including
the
return
of
linen
,
fork
,
and
spoon
.
It
was
happy
for
them
*NL*
if
some
ambitious
draper
of
their
acquaintance
had
not
brought
up
his
*NL*
son
to
the
Church
,
and
if
that
young
gentleman
,
at
the
age
of
*NL*
four-and-twenty
,
had
not
closed
his
college
dissipations
by
an
*NL*
imprudent
marriage
;
otherwise
,
these
innocent
fathers
,
desirous
of
*NL*
doing
the
best
for
their
offspring
,
could
only
escape
the
draper
's
son
*NL*
by
happening
to
be
on
the
foundation
of
a
grammar-school
as
yet
*NL*
unvisited
by
commissioners
,
where
two
or
three
boys
could
have
,
all
to
*NL*
themselves
,
the
advantages
of
a
large
and
lofty
building
,
together
*NL*
with
a
head-master
,
toothless
,
dim-eyed
and
deaf
,
whose
erudite
*NL*
indistinctness
and
inattention
were
engrossed
by
them
at
the
rate
of
*NL*
three
hundred
pounds
a-head
,
--
a
ripe
scholar
,
doubtless
,
when
first
*NL*
appointed
;
but
all
ripeness
beneath
the
sun
has
a
further
stage
less
*NL*
esteemed
in
the
market
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
Tulliver
,
then
,
compared
with
many
other
British
youths
of
his
*NL*
time
who
have
since
had
to
scramble
through
life
with
some
fragments
*NL*
of
more
or
less
relevant
knowledge
,
and
a
great
deal
of
strictly
*NL*
relevant
ignorance
,
was
not
so
very
unlucky
.
Mr.
Stelling
was
a
*NL*
broad-chested
,
healthy
man
,
with
the
bearing
of
a
gentleman
,
a
*NL*
conviction
that
a
growing
boy
required
a
sufficiency
of
beef
,
and
a
*NL*
certain
hearty
kindness
in
him
that
made
him
like
to
see
Tom
looking
*NL*
well
and
enjoying
his
dinner
;
not
a
man
of
refined
conscience
,
or
with
*NL*
any
deep
sense
of
the
infinite
issues
belonging
to
every-day
duties
,
*NL*
not
quite
competent
to
his
high
offices
;
but
incompetent
gentlemen
*NL*
must
live
,
and
without
private
fortune
it
is
difficult
to
see
how
they
*NL*
could
all
live
genteelly
if
they
had
nothing
to
do
with
education
or
*NL*
government
.
Besides
,
it
was
the
fault
of
Tom
's
mental
constitution
*NL*
that
his
faculties
could
not
be
nourished
on
the
sort
of
knowledge
Mr.
*NL*
Stelling
had
to
communicate
.
A
boy
born
with
a
deficient
power
of
*NL*
apprehending
signs
and
abstractions
must
suffer
the
penalty
of
his
*NL*
congenital
deficiency
,
just
as
if
he
had
been
born
with
one
leg
*NL*
shorter
than
the
other
.
A
method
of
education
sanctioned
by
the
long
*NL*
practice
of
our
venerable
ancestors
was
not
to
give
way
before
the
*NL*
exceptional
dulness
of
a
boy
who
was
merely
living
at
the
time
then
*NL*
present
.
And
Mr.
Stelling
was
convinced
that
a
boy
so
stupid
at
signs
*NL*
and
abstractions
must
be
stupid
at
everything
else
,
even
if
that
*NL*
reverend
gentleman
could
have
taught
him
everything
else
.
It
was
the
*NL*
practice
of
our
venerable
ancestors
to
apply
that
ingenious
instrument
*NL*
the
thumb-screw
,
and
to
tighten
and
tighten
it
in
order
to
elicit
*NL*
non-existent
facts
;
they
had
a
fixed
opinion
to
begin
with
,
that
the
*NL*
facts
were
existent
,
and
what
had
they
to
do
but
to
tighten
the
*NL*
thumb-screw
?
In
like
manner
,
Mr.
Stelling
had
a
fixed
opinion
that
all
*NL*
boys
with
any
capacity
could
learn
what
it
was
the
only
regular
thing
*NL*
to
teach
;
if
they
were
slow
,
the
thumb-screw
must
be
tightened
,
--
the
*NL*
exercises
must
be
insisted
on
with
increased
severity
,
and
a
page
of
*NL*
Virgil
be
awarded
as
a
penalty
,
to
encourage
and
stimulate
a
too
*NL*
languid
inclination
to
Latin
verse
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
thumb-screw
was
a
little
relaxed
,
however
,
during
this
second
*NL*
half-year
.
Philip
was
so
advanced
in
his
studies
,
and
so
apt
,
that
Mr.
*NL*
Stelling
could
obtain
credit
by
his
facility
,
which
required
little
*NL*
help
,
much
more
easily
than
by
the
troublesome
process
of
overcoming
*NL*
Tom
's
dulness
.
Gentlemen
with
broad
chests
and
ambitious
intentions
do
*NL*
sometimes
disappoint
their
friends
by
failing
to
carry
the
world
*NL*
before
them
.
Perhaps
it
is
that
high
achievements
demand
some
other
*NL*
unusual
qualification
besides
an
unusual
desire
for
high
prizes
;
*NL*
perhaps
it
is
that
these
stalwart
gentlemen
are
rather
indolent
,
their
*NL*
_
divinae
particulum
aurae
_
being
obstructed
from
soaring
by
a
too
hearty
*NL*
appetite
.
Some
reason
or
other
there
was
why
Mr.
Stelling
deferred
the
*NL*
execution
of
many
spirited
projects
,
--
why
he
did
not
begin
the
editing
*NL*
of
his
Greek
play
,
or
any
other
work
of
scholarship
,
in
his
leisure
*NL*
hours
,
but
,
after
turning
the
key
of
his
private
study
with
much
*NL*
resolution
,
sat
down
to
one
of
Theodore
Hook
's
novels
.
Tom
was
*NL*
gradually
allowed
to
shuffle
through
his
lessons
with
less
rigor
,
and
*NL*
having
Philip
to
help
him
,
he
was
able
to
make
some
show
of
having
*NL*
applied
his
mind
in
a
confused
and
blundering
way
,
without
being
*NL*
cross-examined
into
a
betrayal
that
his
mind
had
been
entirely
neutral
*NL*
in
the
matter
.
He
thought
school
much
more
bearable
under
this
*NL*
modification
of
circumstances
;
and
he
went
on
contentedly
enough
,
*NL*
picking
up
a
promiscuous
education
chiefly
from
things
that
were
not
*NL*
intended
as
education
at
all
.
What
was
understood
to
be
his
education
*NL*
was
simply
the
practice
of
reading
,
writing
,
and
spelling
,
carried
on
*NL*
by
an
elaborate
appliance
of
unintelligible
ideas
,
and
by
much
failure
*NL*
in
the
effort
to
learn
by
rote
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
there
was
a
visible
improvement
in
Tom
under
this
*NL*
training
;
perhaps
because
he
was
not
a
boy
in
the
abstract
,
existing
*NL*
solely
to
illustrate
the
evils
of
a
mistaken
education
,
but
a
boy
made
*NL*
of
flesh
and
blood
,
with
dispositions
not
entirely
at
the
mercy
of
*NL*
circumstances
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
great
improvement
in
his
bearing
,
for
example
;
and
some
*NL*
credit
on
this
score
was
due
to
Mr.
Poulter
,
the
village
schoolmaster
,
*NL*
who
,
being
an
old
Peninsular
soldier
,
was
employed
to
drill
Tom
,
--
a
*NL*
source
of
high
mutual
pleasure
.
Mr.
Poulter
,
who
was
understood
by
the
*NL*
company
at
the
Black
Swan
to
have
once
struck
terror
into
the
hearts
*NL*
of
the
French
,
was
no
longer
personally
formidable
.
He
had
rather
a
*NL*
shrunken
appearance
,
and
was
tremulous
in
the
mornings
,
not
from
age
,
*NL*
but
from
the
extreme
perversity
of
the
King
's
Lorton
boys
,
which
*NL*
nothing
but
gin
could
enable
him
to
sustain
with
any
firmness
.
Still
,
*NL*
he
carried
himself
with
martial
erectness
,
had
his
clothes
*NL*
scrupulously
brushed
,
and
his
trousers
tightly
strapped
;
and
on
the
*NL*
Wednesday
and
Saturday
afternoons
,
when
he
came
to
Tom
,
he
was
always
*NL*
inspired
with
gin
and
old
memories
,
which
gave
him
an
exceptionally
*NL*
spirited
air
,
as
of
a
superannuated
charger
who
hears
the
drum
.
The
*NL*
drilling-lessons
were
always
protracted
by
episodes
of
warlike
*NL*
narrative
,
much
more
interesting
to
Tom
than
Philip
's
stories
out
of
*NL*
the
Iliad
;
for
there
were
no
cannon
in
the
Iliad
,
and
besides
,
Tom
had
*NL*
felt
some
disgust
on
learning
that
Hector
and
Achilles
might
possibly
*NL*
never
have
existed
.
But
the
Duke
of
Wellington
was
really
alive
,
and
*NL*
Bony
had
not
been
long
dead
;
therefore
Mr.
Poulter
's
reminiscences
of
*NL*
the
Peninsular
War
were
removed
from
all
suspicion
of
being
mythical
.
*NL*
Mr.
Poulter
,
it
appeared
,
had
been
a
conspicuous
figure
at
Talavera
,
*NL*
and
had
contributed
not
a
little
to
the
peculiar
terror
with
which
his
*NL*
regiment
of
infantry
was
regarded
by
the
enemy
.
On
afternoons
when
his
*NL*
memory
was
more
stimulated
than
usual
,
he
remembered
that
the
Duke
of
*NL*
Wellington
had
-LRB-
in
strict
privacy
,
lest
jealousies
should
be
awakened
-RRB-
*NL*
expressed
his
esteem
for
that
fine
fellow
Poulter
.
The
very
surgeon
*NL*
who
attended
him
in
the
hospital
after
he
had
received
his
*NL*
gunshot-wound
had
been
profoundly
impressed
with
the
superiority
of
*NL*
Mr.
Poulter
's
flesh
,
--
no
other
flesh
would
have
healed
in
anything
*NL*
like
the
same
time
.
On
less
personal
matters
connected
with
the
*NL*
important
warfare
in
which
he
had
been
engaged
,
Mr.
Poulter
was
more
*NL*
reticent
,
only
taking
care
not
to
give
the
weight
of
his
authority
to
*NL*
any
loose
notions
concerning
military
history
.
Any
one
who
pretended
*NL*
to
a
knowledge
of
what
occurred
at
the
siege
of
Badajos
was
especially
*NL*
an
object
of
silent
pity
to
Mr.
Poulter
;
he
wished
that
prating
person
*NL*
had
been
run
down
,
and
had
the
breath
trampled
out
of
him
at
the
first
*NL*
go-off
,
as
he
himself
had
,
--
he
might
talk
about
the
siege
of
Badajos
*NL*
then
!
Tom
did
not
escape
irritating
his
drilling-master
occasionally
,
*NL*
by
his
curiosity
concerning
other
military
matters
than
Mr.
Poulter
's
*NL*
personal
experience
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
General
Wolfe
,
Mr.
Poulter
,
--
was
n't
he
a
wonderful
fighter
?
''
said
*NL*
Tom
,
who
held
the
notion
that
all
the
martial
heroes
commemorated
on
*NL*
the
public-house
signs
were
engaged
in
the
war
with
Bony
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all
!
''
said
Mr.
Poulter
,
contemptuously
.
``
Nothing
o
'
the
sort
!
*NL*
Heads
up
!
''
he
added
,
in
a
tone
of
stern
command
,
which
delighted
Tom
,
*NL*
and
made
him
feel
as
if
he
were
a
regiment
in
his
own
person
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
!
''
Mr.
Poulter
would
continue
,
on
coming
to
a
pause
in
his
*NL*
discipline
;
``
they
'd
better
not
talk
to
me
about
General
Wolfe
.
He
did
*NL*
nothing
but
die
of
his
wound
;
that
's
a
poor
haction
,
I
consider
.
Any
*NL*
other
man
`
ud
have
died
o
'
the
wounds
I
've
had
.
One
of
my
sword-cuts
*NL*
`
ud
ha
'
killed
a
fellow
like
General
Wolfe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Poulter
,
''
Tom
would
say
,
at
any
allusion
to
the
sword
,
``
I
wish
*NL*
you
'd
bring
your
sword
and
do
the
sword-exercise
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
long
while
Mr.
Poulter
only
shook
his
head
in
a
significant
*NL*
manner
at
this
request
,
and
smiled
patronizingly
,
as
Jupiter
may
have
*NL*
done
when
Semele
urged
her
too
ambitious
request
.
But
one
afternoon
,
*NL*
when
a
sudden
shower
of
heavy
rain
had
detained
Mr.
Poulter
twenty
*NL*
minutes
longer
than
usual
at
the
Black
Swan
,
the
sword
was
*NL*
brought
,
--
just
for
Tom
to
look
at
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
this
is
the
real
sword
you
fought
with
in
all
the
battles
,
Mr.
*NL*
Poulter
?
''
said
Tom
,
handling
the
hilt
.
``
Has
it
ever
cut
a
Frenchman
's
*NL*
head
off
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Head
off
?
Ah
!
and
would
,
if
he
'd
had
three
heads
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
had
a
gun
and
bayonet
besides
?
''
said
Tom
.
''
_
I
_
should
like
*NL*
the
gun
and
bayonet
best
,
because
you
could
shoot
'em
first
and
spear
*NL*
'em
after
.
Bang
!
Ps-s-s-s
!
''
Tom
gave
the
requisite
pantomime
to
*NL*
indicate
the
double
enjoyment
of
pulling
the
trigger
and
thrusting
the
*NL*
spear
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
but
the
sword
's
the
thing
when
you
come
to
close
fighting
,
''
said
*NL*
Mr.
Poulter
,
involuntarily
falling
in
with
Tom
's
enthusiasm
,
and
*NL*
drawing
the
sword
so
suddenly
that
Tom
leaped
back
with
much
agility
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
but
,
Mr.
Poulter
,
if
you
're
going
to
do
the
exercise
,
''
said
Tom
,
*NL*
a
little
conscious
that
he
had
not
stood
his
ground
as
became
an
*NL*
Englishman
,
``
let
me
go
and
call
Philip
.
He
'll
like
to
see
you
,
you
*NL*
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
the
humpbacked
lad
?
''
said
Mr.
Poulter
,
contemptuously
;
``
what
's
*NL*
the
use
of
_
his
_
looking
on
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
but
he
knows
a
great
deal
about
fighting
,
''
said
Tom
,
``
and
how
*NL*
they
used
to
fight
with
bows
and
arrows
,
and
battle-axes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
him
come
,
then
.
I
'll
show
him
something
different
from
his
bows
*NL*
and
arrows
,
''
said
Mr.
Poulter
,
coughing
and
drawing
himself
up
,
while
*NL*
he
gave
a
little
preliminary
play
to
his
wrist
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
ran
in
to
Philip
,
who
was
enjoying
his
afternoon
's
holiday
at
the
*NL*
piano
,
in
the
drawing-room
,
picking
out
tunes
for
himself
and
singing
*NL*
them
.
He
was
supremely
happy
,
perched
like
an
amorphous
bundle
on
the
*NL*
high
stool
,
with
his
head
thrown
back
,
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
opposite
*NL*
cornice
,
and
his
lips
wide
open
,
sending
forth
,
with
all
his
might
,
*NL*
impromptu
syllables
to
a
tune
of
Arne
's
which
had
hit
his
fancy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
Philip
,
''
said
Tom
,
bursting
in
;
``
do
n't
stay
roaring
`
la
la
'
*NL*
there
;
come
and
see
old
Poulter
do
his
sword-exercise
in
the
*NL*
carriage-house
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
jar
of
this
interruption
,
the
discord
of
Tom
's
tones
coming
across
*NL*
the
notes
to
which
Philip
was
vibrating
in
soul
and
body
,
would
have
*NL*
been
enough
to
unhinge
his
temper
,
even
if
there
had
been
no
question
*NL*
of
Poulter
the
drilling-master
;
and
Tom
,
in
the
hurry
of
seizing
*NL*
something
to
say
to
prevent
Mr.
Poulter
from
thinking
he
was
afraid
of
*NL*
the
sword
when
he
sprang
away
from
it
,
had
alighted
on
this
*NL*
proposition
to
fetch
Philip
,
though
he
knew
well
enough
that
Philip
*NL*
hated
to
hear
him
mention
his
drilling-lessons
.
Tom
would
never
have
*NL*
done
so
inconsiderate
a
thing
except
under
the
severe
stress
of
his
*NL*
personal
pride
.
*NL*
*NL*
Philip
shuddered
visibly
as
he
paused
from
his
music
.
Then
turning
*NL*
red
,
he
said
,
with
violent
passion
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Get
away
,
you
lumbering
idiot
!
Do
n't
come
bellowing
at
me
;
you
're
not
*NL*
fit
to
speak
to
anything
but
a
cart-horse
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
the
first
time
Philip
had
been
made
angry
by
him
,
but
Tom
*NL*
had
never
before
been
assailed
with
verbal
missiles
that
he
understood
*NL*
so
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
fit
to
speak
to
something
better
than
you
,
you
poor-spirited
*NL*
imp
!
''
said
Tom
,
lighting
up
immediately
at
Philip
's
fire
.
``
You
know
I
*NL*
wo
n't
hit
you
,
because
you
're
no
better
than
a
girl
.
But
I
'm
an
honest
*NL*
man
's
son
,
and
_
your
_
father
's
a
rogue
;
everybody
says
so
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
flung
out
of
the
room
,
and
slammed
the
door
after
him
,
made
*NL*
strangely
heedless
by
his
anger
;
for
to
slam
doors
within
the
hearing
*NL*
of
Mrs.
Stelling
,
who
was
probably
not
far
off
,
was
an
offence
only
to
*NL*
be
wiped
out
by
twenty
lines
of
Virgil
.
In
fact
,
that
lady
did
*NL*
presently
descend
from
her
room
,
in
double
wonder
at
the
noise
and
the
*NL*
subsequent
cessation
of
Philip
's
music
.
She
found
him
sitting
in
a
*NL*
heap
on
the
hassock
,
and
crying
bitterly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
matter
,
Wakem
?
what
was
that
noise
about
?
Who
slammed
the
*NL*
door
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Philip
looked
up
,
and
hastily
dried
his
eyes
.
``
It
was
Tulliver
who
*NL*
came
in
--
to
ask
me
to
go
out
with
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
are
you
in
trouble
about
?
''
said
Mrs.
Stelling
.
*NL*
*NL*
Philip
was
not
her
favorite
of
the
two
pupils
;
he
was
less
obliging
*NL*
than
Tom
,
who
was
made
useful
in
many
ways
.
Still
,
his
father
paid
*NL*
more
than
Mr.
Tulliver
did
,
and
she
meant
him
to
feel
that
she
behaved
*NL*
exceedingly
well
to
him
.
Philip
,
however
,
met
her
advances
toward
a
*NL*
good
understanding
very
much
as
a
caressed
mollusk
meets
an
invitation
*NL*
to
show
himself
out
of
his
shell
.
Mrs.
Stelling
was
not
a
loving
,
*NL*
tender-hearted
woman
;
she
was
a
woman
whose
skirt
sat
well
,
who
*NL*
adjusted
her
waist
and
patted
her
curls
with
a
preoccupied
air
when
*NL*
she
inquired
after
your
welfare
.
These
things
,
doubtless
,
represent
a
*NL*
great
social
power
,
but
it
is
not
the
power
of
love
;
and
no
other
*NL*
power
could
win
Philip
from
his
personal
reserve
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
said
,
in
answer
to
her
question
,
``
My
toothache
came
on
,
and
made
me
*NL*
hysterical
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
had
been
the
fact
once
,
and
Philip
was
glad
of
the
recollection
;
*NL*
it
was
like
an
inspiration
to
enable
him
to
excuse
his
crying
.
He
had
*NL*
to
accept
eau-de-Cologne
and
to
refuse
creosote
in
consequence
;
but
*NL*
that
was
easy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
Tom
,
who
had
for
the
first
time
sent
a
poisoned
arrow
into
*NL*
Philip
's
heart
,
had
returned
to
the
carriage-house
,
where
he
found
Mr.
*NL*
Poulter
,
with
a
fixed
and
earnest
eye
,
wasting
the
perfections
of
his
*NL*
sword-exercise
on
probably
observant
but
inappreciative
rats
.
But
Mr.
*NL*
Poulter
was
a
host
in
himself
;
that
is
to
say
,
he
admired
himself
more
*NL*
than
a
whole
army
of
spectators
could
have
admired
him
.
He
took
no
*NL*
notice
of
Tom
's
return
,
being
too
entirely
absorbed
in
the
cut
and
*NL*
thrust
,
--
the
solemn
one
,
two
,
three
,
four
;
and
Tom
,
not
without
a
*NL*
slight
feeling
of
alarm
at
Mr.
Poulter
's
fixed
eye
and
hungry-looking
*NL*
sword
,
which
seemed
impatient
for
something
else
to
cut
besides
the
*NL*
air
,
admired
the
performance
from
as
great
a
distance
as
possible
.
It
*NL*
was
not
until
Mr.
Poulter
paused
and
wiped
the
perspiration
from
his
*NL*
forehead
,
that
Tom
felt
the
full
charm
of
the
sword-exercise
,
and
*NL*
wished
it
to
be
repeated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Poulter
,
''
said
Tom
,
when
the
sword
was
being
finally
sheathed
,
``
I
*NL*
wish
you
'd
lend
me
your
sword
a
little
while
to
keep
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
no
,
young
gentleman
,
''
said
Mr.
Poulter
,
shaking
his
head
*NL*
decidedly
;
``
you
might
do
yourself
some
mischief
with
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
'm
sure
I
would
n't
;
I
'm
sure
I
'd
take
care
and
not
hurt
myself
.
*NL*
I
should
n't
take
it
out
of
the
sheath
much
,
but
I
could
ground
arms
*NL*
with
it
,
and
all
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
it
wo
n't
do
,
I
tell
you
;
it
wo
n't
do
,
''
said
Mr.
Poulter
,
*NL*
preparing
to
depart
.
``
What
`
ud
Mr.
Stelling
say
to
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
say
,
do
,
Mr.
Poulter
!
I
'd
give
you
my
five-shilling
piece
if
*NL*
you
'd
let
me
keep
the
sword
a
week
.
Look
here
!
''
said
Tom
,
reaching
out
*NL*
the
attractively
large
round
of
silver
.
The
young
dog
calculated
the
*NL*
effect
as
well
as
if
he
had
been
a
philosopher
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Mr.
Poulter
,
with
still
deeper
gravity
,
``
you
must
keep
it
*NL*
out
of
sight
,
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
,
I
'll
keep
it
under
the
bed
,
''
said
Tom
,
eagerly
,
``
or
else
at
*NL*
the
bottom
of
my
large
box
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
let
me
see
,
now
,
whether
you
can
draw
it
out
of
the
sheath
*NL*
without
hurting
yourself
.
''
That
process
having
been
gone
through
more
*NL*
than
once
,
Mr.
Poulter
felt
that
he
had
acted
with
scrupulous
*NL*
conscientiousness
,
and
said
,
``
Well
,
now
,
Master
Tulliver
,
if
I
take
*NL*
the
crown-piece
,
it
is
to
make
sure
as
you
'll
do
no
mischief
with
the
*NL*
sword
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
,
indeed
,
Mr.
Poulter
,
''
said
Tom
,
delightedly
handing
him
the
*NL*
crown-piece
,
and
grasping
the
sword
,
which
,
he
thought
,
might
have
*NL*
been
lighter
with
advantage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
if
Mr.
Stelling
catches
you
carrying
it
in
?
''
said
Mr.
Poulter
,
*NL*
pocketing
the
crown-piece
provisionally
while
he
raised
this
new
*NL*
doubt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
he
always
keeps
in
his
upstairs
study
on
Saturday
afternoon
,
''
*NL*
said
Tom
,
who
disliked
anything
sneaking
,
but
was
not
disinclined
to
a
*NL*
little
stratagem
in
a
worthy
cause
.
So
he
carried
off
the
sword
in
*NL*
triumph
mixed
with
dread
--
dread
that
he
might
encounter
Mr.
or
Mrs.
*NL*
Stelling
--
to
his
bedroom
,
where
,
after
some
consideration
,
he
hid
it
*NL*
in
the
closet
behind
some
hanging
clothes
.
That
night
he
fell
asleep
*NL*
in
the
thought
that
he
would
astonish
Maggie
with
it
when
she
*NL*
came
,
--
tie
it
round
his
waist
with
his
red
comforter
,
and
make
her
*NL*
believe
that
the
sword
was
his
own
,
and
that
he
was
going
to
be
a
*NL*
soldier
.
There
was
nobody
but
Maggie
who
would
be
silly
enough
to
*NL*
believe
him
,
or
whom
he
dared
allow
to
know
he
had
a
sword
;
and
Maggie
*NL*
was
really
coming
next
week
to
see
Tom
,
before
she
went
to
a
*NL*
boarding-school
with
Lucy
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
you
think
a
lad
of
thirteen
would
have
been
so
childish
,
you
must
*NL*
be
an
exceptionally
wise
man
,
who
,
although
you
are
devoted
to
a
civil
*NL*
calling
,
requiring
you
to
look
bland
rather
than
formidable
,
yet
*NL*
never
,
since
you
had
a
beard
,
threw
yourself
into
a
martial
attitude
,
*NL*
and
frowned
before
the
looking-glass
.
It
is
doubtful
whether
our
*NL*
soldiers
would
be
maintained
if
there
were
not
pacific
people
at
home
*NL*
who
like
to
fancy
themselves
soldiers
.
War
,
like
other
dramatic
*NL*
spectacles
,
might
possibly
cease
for
want
of
a
``
public
.

*NL*
Chapter
V
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
's
Second
Visit
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
This
last
breach
between
the
two
lads
was
not
readily
mended
,
and
for
*NL*
some
time
they
spoke
to
each
other
no
more
than
was
necessary
.
Their
*NL*
natural
antipathy
of
temperament
made
resentment
an
easy
passage
to
*NL*
hatred
,
and
in
Philip
the
transition
seemed
to
have
begun
;
there
was
*NL*
no
malignity
in
his
disposition
,
but
there
was
a
susceptibility
that
*NL*
made
him
peculiarly
liable
to
a
strong
sense
of
repulsion
.
The
ox
--
we
*NL*
may
venture
to
assert
it
on
the
authority
of
a
great
classic
--
is
not
*NL*
given
to
use
his
teeth
as
an
instrument
of
attack
,
and
Tom
was
an
*NL*
excellent
bovine
lad
,
who
ran
at
questionable
objects
in
a
truly
*NL*
ingenious
bovine
manner
;
but
he
had
blundered
on
Philip
's
tenderest
*NL*
point
,
and
had
caused
him
as
much
acute
pain
as
if
he
had
studied
the
*NL*
means
with
the
nicest
precision
and
the
most
envenomed
spite
.
Tom
saw
*NL*
no
reason
why
they
should
not
make
up
this
quarrel
as
they
had
done
*NL*
many
others
,
by
behaving
as
if
nothing
had
happened
;
for
though
he
had
*NL*
never
before
said
to
Philip
that
his
father
was
a
rogue
,
this
idea
had
*NL*
so
habitually
made
part
of
his
feeling
as
to
the
relation
between
*NL*
himself
and
his
dubious
schoolfellow
,
who
he
could
neither
like
nor
*NL*
dislike
,
that
the
mere
utterance
did
not
make
such
an
epoch
to
him
as
*NL*
it
did
to
Philip
.
And
he
had
a
right
to
say
so
when
Philip
hectored
*NL*
over
_
him
_
,
and
called
him
names
.
But
perceiving
that
his
first
*NL*
advances
toward
amity
were
not
met
,
he
relapsed
into
his
least
*NL*
favorable
disposition
toward
Philip
,
and
resolved
never
to
appeal
to
*NL*
him
either
about
drawing
or
exercise
again
.
They
were
only
so
far
*NL*
civil
to
each
other
as
was
necessary
to
prevent
their
state
of
feud
*NL*
from
being
observed
by
Mr.
Stelling
,
who
would
have
``
put
down
''
such
*NL*
nonsense
with
great
vigor
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Maggie
came
,
however
,
she
could
not
help
looking
with
growing
*NL*
interest
at
the
new
schoolfellow
,
although
he
was
the
son
of
that
*NL*
wicked
Lawyer
Wakem
,
who
made
her
father
so
angry
.
She
had
arrived
in
*NL*
the
middle
of
school-hours
,
and
had
sat
by
while
Philip
went
through
*NL*
his
lessons
with
Mr.
Stelling
.
Tom
,
some
weeks
ago
,
had
sent
her
word
*NL*
that
Philip
knew
no
end
of
stories
,
--
not
stupid
stories
like
hers
;
and
*NL*
she
was
convinced
now
from
her
own
observation
that
he
must
be
very
*NL*
clever
;
she
hoped
he
would
think
_
her
_
rather
clever
too
,
when
she
*NL*
came
to
talk
to
him
.
Maggie
,
moreover
,
had
rather
a
tenderness
for
*NL*
deformed
things
;
she
preferred
the
wry-necked
lambs
,
because
it
seemed
*NL*
to
her
that
the
lambs
which
were
quite
strong
and
well
made
would
n't
*NL*
mind
so
much
about
being
petted
;
and
she
was
especially
fond
of
*NL*
petting
objects
that
would
think
it
very
delightful
to
be
petted
by
*NL*
her
.
She
loved
Tom
very
dearly
,
but
she
often
wished
that
he
_
cared
_
*NL*
more
about
her
loving
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
Philip
Wakem
seems
a
nice
boy
,
Tom
,
''
she
said
,
when
they
went
*NL*
out
of
the
study
together
into
the
garden
,
to
pass
the
interval
before
*NL*
dinner
.
``
He
could
n't
choose
his
father
,
you
know
;
and
I
've
read
of
*NL*
very
bad
men
who
had
good
sons
,
as
well
as
good
parents
who
had
bad
*NL*
children
.
And
if
Philip
is
good
,
I
think
we
ought
to
be
the
more
sorry
*NL*
for
him
because
his
father
is
not
a
good
man
.
_
You
_
like
him
,
do
n't
*NL*
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
he
's
a
queer
fellow
,
''
said
Tom
,
curtly
,
``
and
he
's
as
sulky
as
can
*NL*
be
with
me
,
because
I
told
him
his
father
was
a
rogue
.
And
I
'd
a
right
*NL*
to
tell
him
so
,
for
it
was
true
;
and
_
he
_
began
it
,
with
calling
me
*NL*
names
.
But
you
stop
here
by
yourself
a
bit
,
Maggie
,
will
you
?
I
've
got
*NL*
something
I
want
to
do
upstairs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ca
n't
I
go
too
?
''
said
Maggie
,
who
in
this
first
day
of
meeting
again
*NL*
loved
Tom
's
shadow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
it
's
something
I
'll
tell
you
about
by-and-by
,
not
yet
,
''
said
Tom
,
*NL*
skipping
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
afternoon
the
boys
were
at
their
books
in
the
study
,
preparing
*NL*
the
morrow
's
lesson
's
that
they
might
have
a
holiday
in
the
evening
in
*NL*
honor
of
Maggie
's
arrival
.
Tom
was
hanging
over
his
Latin
grammar
,
*NL*
moving
his
lips
inaudibly
like
a
strict
but
impatient
Catholic
*NL*
repeating
his
tale
of
paternosters
;
and
Philip
,
at
the
other
end
of
*NL*
the
room
,
was
busy
with
two
volumes
,
with
a
look
of
contented
*NL*
diligence
that
excited
Maggie
's
curiosity
;
he
did
not
look
at
all
as
*NL*
if
he
were
learning
a
lesson
.
She
sat
on
a
low
stool
at
nearly
a
right
*NL*
angle
with
the
two
boys
,
watching
first
one
and
then
the
other
;
and
*NL*
Philip
,
looking
off
his
book
once
toward
the
fire-place
,
caught
the
*NL*
pair
of
questioning
dark
eyes
fixed
upon
him
.
He
thought
this
sister
*NL*
of
Tulliver
's
seemed
a
nice
little
thing
,
quite
unlike
her
brother
;
he
*NL*
wished
_
he
_
had
a
little
sister
.
What
was
it
,
he
wondered
,
that
made
*NL*
Maggie
's
dark
eyes
remind
him
of
the
stories
about
princesses
being
*NL*
turned
into
animals
?
I
think
it
was
that
her
eyes
were
full
of
*NL*
unsatisfied
intelligence
,
and
unsatisfied
beseeching
affection
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
,
Magsie
,
''
said
Tom
at
last
,
shutting
his
books
and
putting
them
*NL*
away
with
the
energy
and
decision
of
a
perfect
master
in
the
art
of
*NL*
leaving
off
,
``
I
've
done
my
lessons
now
.
Come
upstairs
with
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
said
Maggie
,
when
they
were
outside
the
door
,
a
slight
*NL*
suspicion
crossing
her
mind
as
she
remembered
Tom
's
preliminary
visit
*NL*
upstairs
.
``
It
is
n't
a
trick
you
're
going
to
play
me
,
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
Maggie
,
''
said
Tom
,
in
his
most
coaxing
tone
;
``
It
's
something
*NL*
you
'll
like
_
ever
so
_
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
put
his
arm
round
her
neck
,
and
she
put
hers
round
his
waist
,
and
*NL*
twined
together
in
this
way
,
they
went
upstairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
,
Magsie
,
you
must
not
tell
anybody
,
you
know
,
''
said
Tom
,
``
else
*NL*
I
shall
get
fifty
lines
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
alive
?
''
said
Maggie
,
whose
imagination
had
settled
for
the
*NL*
moment
on
the
idea
that
Tom
kept
a
ferret
clandestinely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
sha
'n'
t
tell
you
,
''
said
he
.
``
Now
you
go
into
that
corner
and
*NL*
hide
your
face
,
while
I
reach
it
out
,
''
he
added
,
as
he
locked
the
*NL*
bedroom
door
behind
them
.
``
I
'll
tell
you
when
to
turn
round
.
You
*NL*
must
n't
squeal
out
,
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
but
if
you
frighten
me
,
I
shall
,
''
said
Maggie
,
beginning
to
look
*NL*
rather
serious
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
wo
n't
be
frightened
,
you
silly
thing
,
''
said
Tom
.
``
Go
and
hide
*NL*
your
face
,
and
mind
you
do
n't
peep
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
I
sha
'n'
t
peep
,
''
said
Maggie
,
disdainfully
;
and
she
buried
*NL*
her
face
in
the
pillow
like
a
person
of
strict
honor
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Tom
looked
round
warily
as
he
walked
to
the
closet
;
then
he
*NL*
stepped
into
the
narrow
space
,
and
almost
closed
the
door
.
Maggie
kept
*NL*
her
face
buried
without
the
aid
of
principle
,
for
in
that
*NL*
dream-suggestive
attitude
she
had
soon
forgotten
where
she
was
,
and
*NL*
her
thoughts
were
busy
with
the
poor
deformed
boy
,
who
was
so
clever
,
*NL*
when
Tom
called
out
,
``
Now
then
,
Magsie
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
but
long
meditation
and
preconcerted
arrangement
of
effects
*NL*
would
have
enabled
Tom
to
present
so
striking
a
figure
as
he
did
to
*NL*
Maggie
when
she
looked
up
.
Dissatisfied
with
the
pacific
aspect
of
a
*NL*
face
which
had
no
more
than
the
faintest
hint
of
flaxen
eyebrow
,
*NL*
together
with
a
pair
of
amiable
blue-gray
eyes
and
round
pink
cheeks
*NL*
that
refused
to
look
formidable
,
let
him
frown
as
he
would
before
the
*NL*
looking-glass
-LRB-
Philip
had
once
told
him
of
a
man
who
had
a
horseshoe
*NL*
frown
,
and
Tom
had
tried
with
all
his
frowning
might
to
make
a
*NL*
horseshoe
on
his
forehead
-RRB-
,
he
had
had
recourse
to
that
unfailing
*NL*
source
of
the
terrible
,
burnt
cork
,
and
had
made
himself
a
pair
of
*NL*
black
eyebrows
that
met
in
a
satisfactory
manner
over
his
nose
,
and
*NL*
were
matched
by
a
less
carefully
adjusted
blackness
about
the
chin
.
He
*NL*
had
wound
a
red
handkerchief
round
his
cloth
cap
to
give
it
the
air
of
*NL*
a
turban
,
and
his
red
comforter
across
his
breast
as
a
scarf
,
--
an
*NL*
amount
of
red
which
,
with
the
tremendous
frown
on
his
brow
,
and
the
*NL*
decision
with
which
he
grasped
the
sword
,
as
he
held
it
with
its
point
*NL*
resting
on
the
ground
,
would
suffice
to
convey
an
approximate
idea
of
*NL*
his
fierce
and
bloodthirsty
disposition
.
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
looked
bewildered
for
a
moment
,
and
Tom
enjoyed
that
moment
*NL*
keenly
;
but
in
the
next
she
laughed
,
clapped
her
hands
together
,
and
*NL*
said
,
``
Oh
,
Tom
,
you
've
made
yourself
like
Bluebeard
at
the
show
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
clear
she
had
not
been
struck
with
the
presence
of
the
*NL*
sword
,
--
it
was
not
unsheathed
.
Her
frivolous
mind
required
a
more
*NL*
direct
appeal
to
its
sense
of
the
terrible
,
and
Tom
prepared
for
his
*NL*
master-stroke
.
Frowning
with
a
double
amount
of
intention
,
if
not
of
*NL*
corrugation
,
he
-LRB-
carefully
-RRB-
drew
the
sword
from
its
sheath
,
and
*NL*
pointed
it
at
Maggie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Tom
,
please
do
n't
!
''
exclaimed
Maggie
,
in
a
tone
of
suppressed
*NL*
dread
,
shrinking
away
from
him
into
the
opposite
corner
.
``
I
_
shall
_
*NL*
scream
--
I
'm
sure
I
shall
!
Oh
,
do
n't
I
wish
I
'd
never
come
upstairs
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
corners
of
Tom
's
mouth
showed
an
inclination
to
a
smile
of
*NL*
complacency
that
was
immediately
checked
as
inconsistent
with
the
*NL*
severity
of
a
great
warrior
.
Slowly
he
let
down
the
scabbard
on
the
*NL*
floor
,
lest
it
should
make
too
much
noise
,
and
then
said
sternly
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
the
Duke
of
Wellington
!
March
!
''
stamping
forward
with
the
right
*NL*
leg
a
little
bent
,
and
the
sword
still
pointing
toward
Maggie
,
who
,
*NL*
trembling
,
and
with
tear-filled
eyes
,
got
upon
the
bed
,
as
the
only
*NL*
means
of
widening
the
space
between
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
,
happy
in
this
spectator
of
his
military
performances
,
even
though
*NL*
the
spectator
was
only
Maggie
,
proceeded
,
with
the
utmost
exertion
of
*NL*
his
force
,
to
such
an
exhibition
of
the
cut
and
thrust
as
would
*NL*
necessarily
be
expected
of
the
Duke
of
Wellington
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tom
,
I
_
will
not
_
bear
it
,
I
_
will
_
scream
,
''
said
Maggie
,
at
the
*NL*
first
movement
of
the
sword
.
``
You
'll
hurt
yourself
;
you
'll
cut
your
*NL*
head
off
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
--
two
,
''
said
Tom
,
resolutely
,
though
at
``
two
''
his
wrist
trembled
a
*NL*
little
.
``
Three
''
came
more
slowly
,
and
with
it
the
sword
swung
*NL*
downward
,
and
Maggie
gave
a
loud
shriek
.
The
sword
had
fallen
,
with
*NL*
its
edge
on
Tom
's
foot
,
and
in
a
moment
after
he
had
fallen
too
.
*NL*
Maggie
leaped
from
the
bed
,
still
shrieking
,
and
immediately
there
was
*NL*
a
rush
of
footsteps
toward
the
room
.
Mr.
Stelling
,
from
his
upstairs
*NL*
study
,
was
the
first
to
enter
.
He
found
both
the
children
on
the
*NL*
floor
.
Tom
had
fainted
,
and
Maggie
was
shaking
him
by
the
collar
of
*NL*
his
jacket
,
screaming
,
with
wild
eyes
.
She
thought
he
was
dead
,
poor
*NL*
child
!
and
yet
she
shook
him
,
as
if
that
would
bring
him
back
to
life
.
*NL*
In
another
minute
she
was
sobbing
with
joy
because
Tom
opened
his
*NL*
eyes
.
She
could
n't
sorrow
yet
that
he
had
hurt
his
foot
;
it
seemed
as
*NL*
if
all
happiness
lay
in
his
being
alive
.

Chapter
VI
*NL*
*NL*
A
Love-Scene
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Tom
bore
his
severe
pain
heroically
,
and
was
resolute
in
not
*NL*
``
telling
''
of
Mr.
Poulter
more
than
was
unavoidable
;
the
five-shilling
*NL*
piece
remained
a
secret
even
to
Maggie
.
But
there
was
a
terrible
dread
*NL*
weighing
on
his
mind
,
so
terrible
that
he
dared
not
even
ask
the
*NL*
question
which
might
bring
the
fatal
``
yes
''
;
he
dared
not
ask
the
*NL*
surgeon
or
Mr.
Stelling
,
``
Shall
I
be
lame
,
Sir
?
''
He
mastered
himself
*NL*
so
as
not
to
cry
out
at
the
pain
;
but
when
his
foot
had
been
dressed
,
*NL*
and
he
was
left
alone
with
Maggie
seated
by
his
bedside
,
the
children
*NL*
sobbed
together
,
with
their
heads
laid
on
the
same
pillow
.
Tom
was
*NL*
thinking
of
himself
walking
about
on
crutches
,
like
the
wheelwright
's
*NL*
son
;
and
Maggie
,
who
did
not
guess
what
was
in
his
mind
,
sobbed
for
*NL*
company
.
It
had
not
occurred
to
the
surgeon
or
to
Mr.
Stelling
to
*NL*
anticipate
this
dread
in
Tom
's
mind
,
and
to
reassure
him
by
hopeful
*NL*
words
.
But
Philip
watched
the
surgeon
out
of
the
house
,
and
waylaid
*NL*
Mr.
Stelling
to
ask
the
very
question
that
Tom
had
not
dared
to
ask
*NL*
for
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beg
your
pardon
,
sir
,
--
but
does
Mr.
Askern
say
Tulliver
will
be
*NL*
lame
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
;
oh
,
no
,
''
said
Mr.
Stelling
,
``
not
permanently
;
only
for
a
*NL*
little
while
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
he
tell
Tulliver
so
,
sir
,
do
you
think
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
nothing
was
said
to
him
on
the
subject
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
may
I
go
and
tell
him
,
sir
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
to
be
sure
;
now
you
mention
it
,
I
dare
say
he
may
be
troubling
*NL*
about
that
.
Go
to
his
bedroom
,
but
be
very
quiet
at
present
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
had
been
Philip
's
first
thought
when
he
heard
of
the
*NL*
accident
,
--
``
Will
Tulliver
be
lame
?
It
will
be
very
hard
for
him
if
he
*NL*
is
''
;
and
Tom
's
hitherto
unforgiven
offences
were
washed
out
by
that
*NL*
pity
.
Philip
felt
that
they
were
no
longer
in
a
state
of
repulsion
,
*NL*
but
were
being
drawn
into
a
common
current
of
suffering
and
sad
*NL*
privation
.
His
imagination
did
not
dwell
on
the
outward
calamity
and
*NL*
its
future
effect
on
Tom
's
life
,
but
it
made
vividly
present
to
him
*NL*
the
probable
state
of
Tom
's
feeling
.
Philip
had
only
lived
fourteen
*NL*
years
,
but
those
years
had
,
most
of
them
,
been
steeped
in
the
sense
of
*NL*
a
lot
irremediably
hard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Askern
says
you
'll
soon
be
all
right
again
,
Tulliver
,
did
you
*NL*
know
?
''
he
said
rather
timidly
,
as
he
stepped
gently
up
to
Tom
's
bed
.
*NL*
``
I
've
just
been
to
ask
Mr.
Stelling
,
and
he
says
you
'll
walk
as
well
*NL*
as
ever
again
by-and-day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
looked
up
with
that
momentary
stopping
of
the
breath
which
comes
*NL*
with
a
sudden
joy
;
then
he
gave
a
long
sigh
,
and
turned
his
blue-gray
*NL*
eyes
straight
on
Philip
's
face
,
as
he
had
not
done
for
a
fortnight
or
*NL*
more
.
As
for
Maggie
,
this
intimation
of
a
possibility
she
had
not
*NL*
thought
of
before
affected
her
as
a
new
trouble
;
the
bare
idea
of
*NL*
Tom
's
being
always
lame
overpowered
the
assurance
that
such
a
*NL*
misfortune
was
not
likely
to
befall
him
,
and
she
clung
to
him
and
*NL*
cried
afresh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
be
a
little
silly
,
Magsie
,
''
said
Tom
,
tenderly
,
feeling
very
*NL*
brave
now
.
``
I
shall
soon
get
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-by
,
Tulliver
,
''
said
Philip
,
putting
out
his
small
,
delicate
*NL*
hand
,
which
Tom
clasped
immediately
with
his
more
substantial
fingers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
,
''
said
Tom
,
``
ask
Mr.
Stelling
to
let
you
come
and
sit
with
me
*NL*
sometimes
,
till
I
get
up
again
,
Wakem
;
and
tell
me
about
Robert
Bruce
,
*NL*
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
that
,
Philip
spent
all
his
time
out
of
school-hours
with
Tom
and
*NL*
Maggie
.
Tom
liked
to
hear
fighting
stories
as
much
as
ever
,
but
he
*NL*
insisted
strongly
on
the
fact
that
those
great
fighters
who
did
so
*NL*
many
wonderful
things
and
came
off
unhurt
,
wore
excellent
armor
from
*NL*
head
to
foot
,
which
made
fighting
easy
work
,
he
considered
.
He
should
*NL*
not
have
hurt
his
foot
if
he
had
had
an
iron
shoe
on
.
He
listened
with
*NL*
great
interest
to
a
new
story
of
Philip
's
about
a
man
who
had
a
very
*NL*
bad
wound
in
his
foot
,
and
cried
out
so
dreadfully
with
the
pain
that
*NL*
his
friends
could
bear
with
him
no
longer
,
but
put
him
ashore
on
a
*NL*
desert
island
,
with
nothing
but
some
wonderful
poisoned
arrows
to
kill
*NL*
animals
with
for
food
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
roar
out
a
bit
,
you
know
,
''
Tom
said
,
``
and
I
dare
say
my
foot
*NL*
was
as
bad
as
his
.
It
's
cowardly
to
roar
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Maggie
would
have
it
that
when
anything
hurt
you
very
much
,
it
was
*NL*
quite
permissible
to
cry
out
,
and
it
was
cruel
of
people
not
to
bear
*NL*
it
.
She
wanted
to
know
if
Philoctetes
had
a
sister
,
and
why
_
she
_
*NL*
did
n't
go
with
him
on
the
desert
island
and
take
care
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
,
soon
after
Philip
had
told
this
story
,
he
and
Maggie
were
in
*NL*
the
study
alone
together
while
Tom
's
foot
was
being
dressed
.
Philip
*NL*
was
at
his
books
,
and
Maggie
,
after
sauntering
idly
round
the
room
,
*NL*
not
caring
to
do
anything
in
particular
,
because
she
would
soon
go
to
*NL*
Tom
again
,
went
and
leaned
on
the
table
near
Philip
to
see
what
he
was
*NL*
doing
,
for
they
were
quite
old
friends
now
,
and
perfectly
at
home
with
*NL*
each
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
reading
about
in
Greek
?
''
she
said
.
``
It
's
poetry
,
I
can
*NL*
see
that
,
because
the
lines
are
so
short
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
about
Philoctetes
,
the
lame
man
I
was
telling
you
of
yesterday
,
''
*NL*
he
answered
,
resting
his
head
on
his
hand
,
and
looking
at
her
as
if
he
*NL*
were
not
at
all
sorry
to
be
interrupted
.
Maggie
,
in
her
absent
way
,
*NL*
continued
to
lean
forward
,
resting
on
her
arms
and
moving
her
feet
*NL*
about
,
while
her
dark
eyes
got
more
and
more
fixed
and
vacant
,
as
if
*NL*
she
had
quite
forgotten
Philip
and
his
book
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Maggie
,
''
said
Philip
,
after
a
minute
or
two
,
still
leaning
on
his
*NL*
elbow
and
looking
at
her
,
``
if
you
had
had
a
brother
like
me
,
do
you
*NL*
think
you
should
have
loved
him
as
well
as
Tom
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
started
a
little
on
being
roused
from
her
reverie
,
and
said
,
*NL*
``
What
?
''
Philip
repeated
his
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
better
,
''
she
answered
immediately
.
``
No
,
not
better
;
because
*NL*
I
do
n't
think
I
_
could
_
love
you
better
than
Tom
.
But
I
should
be
so
*NL*
sorry
,
--
_
so
sorry
_
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Philip
colored
;
he
had
meant
to
imply
,
would
she
love
him
as
well
in
*NL*
spite
of
his
deformity
,
and
yet
when
she
alluded
to
it
so
plainly
,
he
*NL*
winced
under
her
pity
.
Maggie
,
young
as
she
was
,
felt
her
mistake
.
*NL*
Hitherto
she
had
instinctively
behaved
as
if
she
were
quite
*NL*
unconscious
of
Philip
's
deformity
;
her
own
keen
sensitiveness
and
*NL*
experience
under
family
criticism
sufficed
to
teach
her
this
as
well
*NL*
as
if
she
had
been
directed
by
the
most
finished
breeding
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
are
so
very
clever
,
Philip
,
and
you
can
play
and
sing
,
''
she
*NL*
added
quickly
.
``
I
wish
you
_
were
_
my
brother
.
I
'm
very
fond
of
you
.
*NL*
And
you
would
stay
at
home
with
me
when
Tom
went
out
,
and
you
would
*NL*
teach
me
everything
;
would
n't
you
,
--
Greek
and
everything
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
'll
go
away
soon
,
and
go
to
school
,
Maggie
,
''
said
Philip
,
``
and
*NL*
then
you
'll
forget
all
about
me
,
and
not
care
for
me
any
more
.
And
*NL*
then
I
shall
see
you
when
you
're
grown
up
,
and
you
'll
hardly
take
any
*NL*
notice
of
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
I
sha
'n'
t
forget
you
,
I
'm
sure
,
''
said
Maggie
,
shaking
her
*NL*
head
very
seriously
.
``
I
never
forget
anything
,
and
I
think
about
*NL*
everybody
when
I
'm
away
from
them
.
I
think
about
poor
Yap
;
he
's
got
a
*NL*
lump
in
his
throat
,
and
Luke
says
he
'll
die
.
Only
do
n't
you
tell
Tom
.
*NL*
because
it
will
vex
him
so
.
You
never
saw
Yap
;
he
's
a
queer
little
*NL*
dog
,
--
nobody
cares
about
him
but
Tom
and
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
care
as
much
about
me
as
you
do
about
Yap
,
Maggie
?
''
said
*NL*
Philip
,
smiling
rather
sadly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
I
should
think
so
,
''
said
Maggie
,
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
very
fond
of
_
you
_
,
Maggie
;
I
shall
never
forget
_
you
_
,
''
said
*NL*
Philip
,
``
and
when
I
'm
very
unhappy
,
I
shall
always
think
of
you
,
and
*NL*
wish
I
had
a
sister
with
dark
eyes
,
just
like
yours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
you
like
my
eyes
?
''
said
Maggie
,
well
pleased
.
She
had
never
*NL*
heard
any
one
but
her
father
speak
of
her
eyes
as
if
they
had
merit
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
said
Philip
.
``
They
're
not
like
any
other
eyes
.
They
*NL*
seem
trying
to
speak
,
--
trying
to
speak
kindly
.
I
do
n't
like
other
*NL*
people
to
look
at
me
much
,
but
I
like
you
to
look
at
me
,
Maggie
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
I
think
you
're
fonder
of
me
than
Tom
is
,
''
said
Maggie
,
rather
*NL*
sorrowfully
.
Then
,
wondering
how
she
could
convince
Philip
that
she
*NL*
could
like
him
just
as
well
,
although
he
was
crooked
,
she
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Should
you
like
me
to
kiss
you
,
as
I
do
Tom
?
I
will
,
if
you
like
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
very
much
;
nobody
kisses
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
put
her
arm
round
his
neck
and
kissed
him
quite
earnestly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
now
,
''
she
said
,
``
I
shall
always
remember
you
,
and
kiss
you
when
*NL*
I
see
you
again
,
if
it
's
ever
so
long
.
But
I
'll
go
now
,
because
I
*NL*
think
Mr.
Askern
's
done
with
Tom
's
foot
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
their
father
came
the
second
time
,
Maggie
said
to
him
,
``
Oh
,
*NL*
father
,
Philip
Wakem
is
so
very
good
to
Tom
;
he
is
such
a
clever
boy
,
*NL*
and
I
_
do
_
love
him
.
And
you
love
him
too
,
Tom
,
do
n't
you
?
_
Say
_
you
*NL*
love
him
,
''
she
added
entreatingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
colored
a
little
as
he
looked
at
his
father
,
and
said
:
``
I
sha
'n'
t
*NL*
be
friends
with
him
when
I
leave
school
,
father
;
but
we
've
made
it
up
*NL*
now
,
since
my
foot
has
been
bad
,
and
he
's
taught
me
to
play
at
*NL*
draughts
,
and
I
can
beat
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
well
,
''
said
Mr.
Tulliver
,
``
if
he
's
good
to
you
,
try
and
make
*NL*
him
amends
,
and
be
good
to
_
him
_
.
He
's
a
poor
crooked
creature
,
and
*NL*
takes
after
his
dead
mother
.
But
do
n't
you
be
getting
too
thick
with
*NL*
him
;
he
's
got
his
father
's
blood
in
him
too
.
Ay
,
ay
,
the
gray
colt
may
*NL*
chance
to
kick
like
his
black
sire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
jarring
natures
of
the
two
boys
effected
what
Mr.
Tulliver
's
*NL*
admonition
alone
might
have
failed
to
effect
;
in
spite
of
Philip
's
new
*NL*
kindness
,
and
Tom
's
answering
regard
in
this
time
of
his
trouble
,
they
*NL*
never
became
close
friends
.
When
Maggie
was
gone
,
and
when
Tom
*NL*
by-and-by
began
to
walk
about
as
usual
,
the
friendly
warmth
that
had
*NL*
been
kindled
by
pity
and
gratitude
died
out
by
degrees
,
and
left
them
*NL*
in
their
old
relation
to
each
other
.
Philip
was
often
peevish
and
*NL*
contemptuous
;
and
Tom
's
more
specific
and
kindly
impressions
gradually
*NL*
melted
into
the
old
background
of
suspicion
and
dislike
toward
him
as
*NL*
a
queer
fellow
,
a
humpback
,
and
the
son
of
a
rogue
.
If
boys
and
men
*NL*
are
to
be
welded
together
in
the
glow
of
transient
feeling
,
they
must
*NL*
be
made
of
metal
that
will
mix
,
else
they
inevitably
fall
asunder
when
*NL*
the
heat
dies
out
.

Chapter
VII
*NL*
*NL*
The
Golden
Gates
Are
Passed
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
So
Tom
went
on
even
to
the
fifth
half-year
--
till
he
was
turned
*NL*
sixteen
--
at
King
's
Lorton
,
while
Maggie
was
growing
with
a
rapidity
*NL*
which
her
aunts
considered
highly
reprehensible
,
at
Miss
Firniss
's
*NL*
boarding-school
in
the
ancient
town
of
Laceham
on
the
Floss
,
with
*NL*
cousin
Lucy
for
her
companion
.
In
her
early
letters
to
Tom
she
had
*NL*
always
sent
her
love
to
Philip
,
and
asked
many
questions
about
him
,
*NL*
which
were
answered
by
brief
sentences
about
Tom
's
toothache
,
and
a
*NL*
turf-house
which
he
was
helping
to
build
in
the
garden
,
with
other
*NL*
items
of
that
kind
.
She
was
pained
to
hear
Tom
say
in
the
holidays
*NL*
that
Philip
was
as
queer
as
ever
again
,
and
often
cross
.
They
were
no
*NL*
longer
very
good
friends
,
she
perceived
;
and
when
she
reminded
Tom
*NL*
that
he
ought
always
to
love
Philip
for
being
so
good
to
him
when
his
*NL*
foot
was
bad
,
he
answered
:
``
Well
,
it
is
n't
my
fault
;
_
I
_
do
n't
do
*NL*
anything
to
him
.
''
She
hardly
ever
saw
Philip
during
the
remainder
of
*NL*
their
school-life
;
in
the
Midsummer
holidays
he
was
always
away
at
the
*NL*
seaside
,
and
at
Christmas
she
could
only
meet
him
at
long
intervals
in
*NL*
the
street
of
St.
Ogg
's
.
When
they
did
meet
,
she
remembered
her
*NL*
promise
to
kiss
him
,
but
,
as
a
young
lady
who
had
been
at
a
*NL*
boarding-school
,
she
knew
now
that
such
a
greeting
was
out
of
the
*NL*
question
,
and
Philip
would
not
expect
it
.
The
promise
was
void
,
like
*NL*
so
many
other
sweet
,
illusory
promises
of
our
childhood
;
void
as
*NL*
promises
made
in
Eden
before
the
seasons
were
divided
,
and
when
the
*NL*
starry
blossoms
grew
side
by
side
with
the
ripening
peach
,
--
impossible
*NL*
to
be
fulfilled
when
the
golden
gates
had
been
passed
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
when
their
father
was
actually
engaged
in
the
long-threatened
*NL*
lawsuit
,
and
Wakem
,
as
the
agent
at
once
of
Pivart
and
Old
Harry
,
was
*NL*
acting
against
him
,
even
Maggie
felt
,
with
some
sadness
,
that
they
*NL*
were
not
likely
ever
to
have
any
intimacy
with
Philip
again
;
the
very
*NL*
name
of
Wakem
made
her
father
angry
,
and
she
had
once
heard
him
say
*NL*
that
if
that
crook-backed
son
lived
to
inherit
his
father
's
ill-gotten
*NL*
gains
,
there
would
be
a
curse
upon
him
.
``
Have
as
little
to
do
with
him
*NL*
at
school
as
you
can
,
my
lad
,
''
he
said
to
Tom
;
and
the
command
was
*NL*
obeyed
the
more
easily
because
Mr.
Sterling
by
this
time
had
two
*NL*
additional
pupils
;
for
though
this
gentleman
's
rise
in
the
world
was
*NL*
not
of
that
meteor-like
rapidity
which
the
admirers
of
his
*NL*
extemporaneous
eloquence
had
expected
for
a
preacher
whose
voice
*NL*
demanded
so
wide
a
sphere
,
he
had
yet
enough
of
growing
prosperity
to
*NL*
enable
him
to
increase
his
expenditure
in
continued
disproportion
to
*NL*
his
income
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
Tom
's
school
course
,
it
went
on
with
mill-like
monotony
,
his
*NL*
mind
continuing
to
move
with
a
slow
,
half-stifled
pulse
in
a
medium
*NL*
uninteresting
or
unintelligible
ideas
.
But
each
vacation
he
brought
*NL*
home
larger
and
larger
drawings
with
the
satiny
rendering
of
*NL*
landscape
,
and
water-colors
in
vivid
greens
,
together
with
manuscript
*NL*
books
full
of
exercises
and
problems
,
in
which
the
handwriting
was
all
*NL*
the
finer
because
he
gave
his
whole
mind
to
it
.
Each
vacation
he
*NL*
brought
home
a
new
book
or
two
,
indicating
his
progress
through
*NL*
different
stages
of
history
,
Christian
doctrine
,
and
Latin
literature
;
*NL*
and
that
passage
was
not
entirely
without
results
,
besides
the
*NL*
possession
of
the
books
.
Tom
's
ear
and
tongue
had
become
accustomed
to
*NL*
a
great
many
words
and
phrases
which
are
understood
to
be
signs
of
an
*NL*
educated
condition
;
and
though
he
had
never
really
applied
his
mind
to
*NL*
any
one
of
his
lessons
,
the
lessons
had
left
a
deposit
of
vague
,
*NL*
fragmentary
,
ineffectual
notions
.
Mr.
Tulliver
,
seeing
signs
of
*NL*
acquirement
beyond
the
reach
of
his
own
criticism
,
thought
it
was
*NL*
probably
all
right
with
Tom
's
education
;
he
observed
,
indeed
,
that
*NL*
there
were
no
maps
,
and
not
enough
``
summing
''
;
but
he
made
no
formal
*NL*
complaint
to
Mr.
Stelling
.
It
was
a
puzzling
business
,
this
schooling
;
*NL*
and
if
he
took
Tom
away
,
where
could
he
send
him
with
better
effect
?
*NL*
*NL*
By
the
time
Tom
had
reached
his
last
quarter
at
King
's
Lorton
,
the
*NL*
years
had
made
striking
changes
in
him
since
the
day
we
saw
him
*NL*
returning
from
Mr.
Jacobs
's
academy
.
He
was
a
tall
youth
now
,
carrying
*NL*
himself
without
the
least
awkwardness
,
and
speaking
without
more
*NL*
shyness
than
was
a
becoming
symptom
of
blended
diffidence
and
pride
;
*NL*
he
wore
his
tail-coat
and
his
stand-up
collars
,
and
watched
the
down
*NL*
on
his
lip
with
eager
impatience
,
looking
every
day
at
his
virgin
*NL*
razor
,
with
which
he
had
provided
himself
in
the
last
holidays
.
Philip
*NL*
had
already
left
,
--
at
the
autumn
quarter
,
--
that
he
might
go
to
the
*NL*
south
for
the
winter
,
for
the
sake
of
his
health
;
and
this
change
*NL*
helped
to
give
Tom
the
unsettled
,
exultant
feeling
that
usually
*NL*
belongs
to
the
last
months
before
leaving
school
.
This
quarter
,
too
,
*NL*
there
was
some
hope
of
his
father
's
lawsuit
being
decided
;
_
that
_
made
*NL*
the
prospect
of
home
more
entirely
pleasurable
.
For
Tom
,
who
had
*NL*
gathered
his
view
of
the
case
from
his
father
's
conversation
,
had
no
*NL*
doubt
that
Pivart
would
be
beaten
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
had
not
heard
anything
from
home
for
some
weeks
,
--
a
fact
which
did
*NL*
not
surprise
him
,
for
his
father
and
mother
were
not
apt
to
manifest
*NL*
their
affection
in
unnecessary
letters
,
--
when
,
to
his
great
surprise
,
*NL*
on
the
morning
of
a
dark
,
cold
day
near
the
end
of
November
,
he
was
*NL*
told
,
soon
after
entering
the
study
at
nine
o'clock
,
that
his
sister
*NL*
was
in
the
drawing-room
.
It
was
Mrs.
Stelling
who
had
come
into
the
*NL*
study
to
tell
him
,
and
she
left
him
to
enter
the
drawing-room
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
,
too
,
was
tall
now
,
with
braided
and
coiled
hair
;
she
was
*NL*
almost
as
tall
as
Tom
,
though
she
was
only
thirteen
;
and
she
really
*NL*
looked
older
than
he
did
at
that
moment
.
She
had
thrown
off
her
*NL*
bonnet
,
her
heavy
braids
were
pushed
back
from
her
forehead
,
as
if
it
*NL*
would
not
bear
that
extra
load
,
and
her
young
face
had
a
strangely
*NL*
worn
look
,
as
her
eyes
turned
anxiously
toward
the
door
.
When
Tom
*NL*
entered
she
did
not
speak
,
but
only
went
up
to
him
,
put
her
arms
round
*NL*
his
neck
,
and
kissed
him
earnestly
.
He
was
used
to
various
moods
of
*NL*
hers
,
and
felt
no
alarm
at
the
unusual
seriousness
of
her
greeting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
how
is
it
you
're
come
so
early
this
cold
morning
,
Maggie
?
Did
*NL*
you
come
in
the
gig
?
''
said
Tom
,
as
she
backed
toward
the
sofa
,
and
*NL*
drew
him
to
her
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
came
by
the
coach
.
I
've
walked
from
the
turnpike
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
how
is
it
you
're
not
at
school
?
The
holidays
have
not
begun
yet
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Father
wanted
me
at
home
,
''
said
Maggie
,
with
a
slight
trembling
of
*NL*
the
lip
.
``
I
came
home
three
or
four
days
ago
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
n't
my
father
well
?
''
said
Tom
,
rather
anxiously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
quite
,
''
said
Maggie
.
``
He
's
very
unhappy
,
Tom
.
The
lawsuit
is
*NL*
ended
,
and
I
came
to
tell
you
because
I
thought
it
would
be
better
for
*NL*
you
to
know
it
before
you
came
home
,
and
I
did
n't
like
only
to
send
*NL*
you
a
letter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
father
has
n't
lost
?
''
said
Tom
,
hastily
,
springing
from
the
sofa
,
*NL*
and
standing
before
Maggie
with
his
hands
suddenly
thrust
into
his
*NL*
pockets
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
dear
Tom
,
''
said
Maggie
,
looking
up
at
him
with
trembling
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
was
silent
a
minute
or
two
,
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
floor
.
Then
*NL*
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
father
will
have
to
pay
a
good
deal
of
money
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Maggie
,
rather
faintly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
it
ca
n't
be
helped
,
''
said
Tom
,
bravely
,
not
translating
the
*NL*
loss
of
a
large
sum
of
money
into
any
tangible
results
.
``
But
my
*NL*
father
's
very
much
vexed
,
I
dare
say
?
''
he
added
,
looking
at
Maggie
,
*NL*
and
thinking
that
her
agitated
face
was
only
part
of
her
girlish
way
*NL*
of
taking
things
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Maggie
,
again
faintly
.
Then
,
urged
to
fuller
speech
by
*NL*
Tom
's
freedom
from
apprehension
,
she
said
loudly
and
rapidly
,
as
if
*NL*
the
words
_
would
_
burst
from
her
:
``
Oh
,
Tom
,
he
will
lose
the
mill
and
*NL*
the
land
and
everything
;
he
will
have
nothing
left
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
's
eyes
flashed
out
one
look
of
surprise
at
her
,
before
he
turned
*NL*
pale
,
and
trembled
visibly
.
He
said
nothing
,
but
sat
down
on
the
sofa
*NL*
again
,
looking
vaguely
out
of
the
opposite
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anxiety
about
the
future
had
never
entered
Tom
's
mind
.
His
father
had
*NL*
always
ridden
a
good
horse
,
kept
a
good
house
,
and
had
the
cheerful
,
*NL*
confident
air
of
a
man
who
has
plenty
of
property
to
fall
back
upon
.
*NL*
Tom
had
never
dreamed
that
his
father
would
``
fail
''
;
_
that
_
was
a
form
*NL*
of
misfortune
which
he
had
always
heard
spoken
of
as
a
deep
disgrace
,
*NL*
and
disgrace
was
an
idea
that
he
could
not
associate
with
any
of
his
*NL*
relations
,
least
of
all
with
his
father
.
A
proud
sense
of
family
*NL*
respectability
was
part
of
the
very
air
Tom
had
been
born
and
brought
*NL*
up
in
.
He
knew
there
were
people
in
St.
Ogg
's
who
made
a
show
without
*NL*
money
to
support
it
,
and
he
had
always
heard
such
people
spoken
of
by
*NL*
his
own
friends
with
contempt
and
reprobation
.
He
had
a
strong
belief
,
*NL*
which
was
a
lifelong
habit
,
and
required
no
definite
evidence
to
rest
*NL*
on
,
that
his
father
could
spend
a
great
deal
of
money
if
he
chose
;
and
*NL*
since
his
education
at
Mr.
Stelling
's
had
given
him
a
more
expensive
*NL*
view
of
life
,
he
had
often
thought
that
when
he
got
older
he
would
*NL*
make
a
figure
in
the
world
,
with
his
horse
and
dogs
and
saddle
,
and
*NL*
other
accoutrements
of
a
fine
young
man
,
and
show
himself
equal
to
any
*NL*
of
his
contemporaries
at
St.
Ogg
's
,
who
might
consider
themselves
a
*NL*
grade
above
him
in
society
because
their
fathers
were
professional
*NL*
men
,
or
had
large
oil-mills
.
As
to
the
prognostics
and
headshaking
of
*NL*
his
aunts
and
uncles
,
they
had
never
produced
the
least
effect
on
him
,
*NL*
except
to
make
him
think
that
aunts
and
uncles
were
disagreeable
*NL*
society
;
he
had
heard
them
find
fault
in
much
the
same
way
as
long
as
*NL*
he
could
remember
.
His
father
knew
better
than
they
did
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
down
had
come
on
Tom
's
lip
,
yet
his
thoughts
and
expectations
had
*NL*
been
hitherto
only
the
reproduction
,
in
changed
forms
,
of
the
boyish
*NL*
dreams
in
which
he
had
lived
three
years
ago
.
He
was
awakened
now
with
*NL*
a
violent
shock
.
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
was
frightened
at
Tom
's
pale
,
trembling
silence
.
There
was
*NL*
something
else
to
tell
him
,
--
something
worse
.
She
threw
her
arms
round
*NL*
him
at
last
,
and
said
,
with
a
half
sob
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Tom
--
dear
,
dear
Tom
,
do
n't
fret
too
much
;
try
and
bear
it
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
turned
his
cheek
passively
to
meet
her
entreating
kisses
,
and
*NL*
there
gathered
a
moisture
in
his
eyes
,
which
he
just
rubbed
away
with
*NL*
his
hand
.
The
action
seemed
to
rouse
him
,
for
he
shook
himself
and
*NL*
said
:
``
I
shall
go
home
,
with
you
,
Maggie
.
Did
n't
my
father
say
I
was
*NL*
to
go
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Tom
,
father
did
n't
wish
it
,
''
said
Maggie
,
her
anxiety
about
_
his
_
*NL*
feeling
helping
her
to
master
her
agitation
.
What
_
would
_
he
do
when
*NL*
she
told
him
all
?
``
But
mother
wants
you
to
come
,
--
poor
mother
!
--
she
*NL*
cries
so
.
Oh
,
Tom
,
it
's
very
dreadful
at
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
's
lips
grew
whiter
,
and
she
began
to
tremble
almost
as
Tom
had
*NL*
done
.
The
two
poor
things
clung
closer
to
each
other
,
both
*NL*
trembling
,
--
the
one
at
an
unshapen
fear
,
the
other
at
the
image
of
a
*NL*
terrible
certainty
.
When
Maggie
spoke
,
it
was
hardly
above
a
whisper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
--
and
--
poor
father
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
could
not
utter
it
.
But
the
suspense
was
intolerable
to
Tom
.
A
*NL*
vague
idea
of
going
to
prison
,
as
a
consequence
of
debt
,
was
the
shape
*NL*
his
fears
had
begun
to
take
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
's
my
father
?
''
he
said
impatiently
.
''
_
Tell
_
me
,
Maggie
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
at
home
,
''
said
Maggie
,
finding
it
easier
to
reply
to
that
*NL*
question
.
``
But
,
''
she
added
,
after
a
pause
,
``
not
himself
--
he
fell
off
*NL*
his
horse
.
He
has
known
nobody
but
me
ever
since
--
he
seems
to
have
*NL*
lost
his
senses
.
O
father
,
father
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
these
last
words
,
Maggie
's
sobs
burst
forth
with
the
more
*NL*
violence
for
the
previous
struggle
against
them
.
Tom
felt
that
*NL*
pressure
of
the
heart
which
forbids
tears
;
he
had
no
distinct
vision
*NL*
of
their
troubles
as
Maggie
had
,
who
had
been
at
home
;
he
only
felt
*NL*
the
crushing
weight
of
what
seemed
unmitigated
misfortune
.
He
*NL*
tightened
his
arm
almost
convulsively
round
Maggie
as
she
sobbed
,
but
*NL*
his
face
looked
rigid
and
tearless
,
his
eyes
blank
,
--
as
if
a
black
*NL*
curtain
of
cloud
had
suddenly
fallen
on
his
path
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Maggie
soon
checked
herself
abruptly
;
a
single
thought
had
acted
*NL*
on
her
like
a
startling
sound
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
must
set
out
,
Tom
,
we
must
not
stay
.
Father
will
miss
me
;
we
must
*NL*
be
at
the
turnpike
at
ten
to
meet
the
coach
.
''
She
said
this
with
hasty
*NL*
decision
,
rubbing
her
eyes
,
and
rising
to
seize
her
bonnet
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
at
once
felt
the
same
impulse
,
and
rose
too
.
``
Wait
a
minute
,
*NL*
Maggie
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
must
speak
to
Mr.
Stelling
,
and
then
we
'll
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
thought
he
must
go
to
the
study
where
the
pupils
were
;
but
on
his
*NL*
way
he
met
Mr.
Stelling
,
who
had
heard
from
his
wife
that
Maggie
*NL*
appeared
to
be
in
trouble
when
she
asked
for
her
brother
,
and
now
that
*NL*
he
thought
the
brother
and
sister
had
been
alone
long
enough
,
was
*NL*
coming
to
inquire
and
offer
his
sympathy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Please
,
sir
,
I
must
go
home
,
''
Tom
said
abruptly
,
as
he
met
Mr.
*NL*
Stelling
in
the
passage
.
``
I
must
go
back
with
my
sister
directly
.
My
*NL*
father
's
lost
his
lawsuit
--
he
's
lost
all
his
property
--
and
he
's
very
*NL*
ill
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Stelling
felt
like
a
kind-hearted
man
;
he
foresaw
a
probable
money
*NL*
loss
for
himself
,
but
this
had
no
appreciable
share
in
his
feeling
,
*NL*
while
he
looked
with
grave
pity
at
the
brother
and
sister
for
whom
*NL*
youth
and
sorrow
had
begun
together
.
When
he
knew
how
Maggie
had
come
,
*NL*
and
how
eager
she
was
to
get
home
again
,
he
hurried
their
departure
,
*NL*
only
whispering
something
to
Mrs.
Stelling
,
who
had
followed
him
,
and
*NL*
who
immediately
left
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
and
Maggie
were
standing
on
the
door-step
,
ready
to
set
out
,
when
*NL*
Mrs.
Stelling
came
with
a
little
basket
,
which
she
hung
on
Maggie
's
*NL*
arm
,
saying
:
``
Do
remember
to
eat
something
on
the
way
,
dear
.
''
Maggie
's
*NL*
heart
went
out
toward
this
woman
whom
she
had
never
liked
,
and
she
*NL*
kissed
her
silently
.
It
was
the
first
sign
within
the
poor
child
of
*NL*
that
new
sense
which
is
the
gift
of
sorrow
,
--
that
susceptibility
to
*NL*
the
bare
offices
of
humanity
which
raises
them
into
a
bond
of
loving
*NL*
fellowship
,
as
to
haggard
men
among
the
ice-bergs
the
mere
presence
of
*NL*
an
ordinary
comrade
stirs
the
deep
fountains
of
affection
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Stelling
put
his
hand
on
Tom
's
shoulder
and
said
:
``
God
bless
you
,
*NL*
my
boy
;
let
me
know
how
you
get
on
.
''
Then
he
pressed
Maggie
's
hand
;
*NL*
but
there
were
no
audible
good-byes
.
Tom
had
so
often
thought
how
*NL*
joyful
he
should
be
the
day
he
left
school
``
for
good
''
!
And
now
his
*NL*
school
years
seemed
like
a
holiday
that
had
come
to
an
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
slight
youthful
figures
soon
grew
indistinct
on
the
distant
*NL*
road
,
--
were
soon
lost
behind
the
projecting
hedgerow
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
gone
forth
together
into
their
life
of
sorrow
,
and
they
would
*NL*
never
more
see
the
sunshine
undimmed
by
remembered
cares
.
They
had
*NL*
entered
the
thorny
wilderness
,
and
the
golden
gates
of
their
childhood
*NL*
had
forever
closed
behind
them
.

*NL*
Chapter
I
*NL*
*NL*
What
Had
Happened
at
Home
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
Mr.
Tulliver
first
knew
the
fact
that
the
lawsuit
was
decided
*NL*
against
him
,
and
that
Pivart
and
Wakem
were
triumphant
,
every
one
who
*NL*
happened
to
observe
him
at
the
time
thought
that
,
for
so
confident
and
*NL*
hot-tempered
a
man
,
he
bore
the
blow
remarkably
well
.
He
thought
so
*NL*
himself
;
he
thought
he
was
going
to
show
that
if
Wakem
or
anybody
else
*NL*
considered
him
crushed
,
they
would
find
themselves
mistaken
.
He
could
*NL*
not
refuse
to
see
that
the
costs
of
this
protracted
suit
would
take
*NL*
more
than
he
possessed
to
pay
them
;
but
he
appeared
to
himself
to
be
*NL*
full
of
expedients
by
which
he
could
ward
off
any
results
but
such
as
*NL*
were
tolerable
,
and
could
avoid
the
appearance
of
breaking
down
in
the
*NL*
world
.
All
the
obstinacy
and
defiance
of
his
nature
,
driven
out
of
*NL*
their
old
channel
,
found
a
vent
for
themselves
in
the
immediate
*NL*
formation
of
plans
by
which
he
would
meet
his
difficulties
,
and
remain
*NL*
Mr.
Tulliver
of
Dorlcote
Mill
in
spite
of
them
.
There
was
such
a
rush
*NL*
of
projects
in
his
brain
,
that
it
was
no
wonder
his
face
was
flushed
*NL*
when
he
came
away
from
his
talk
with
his
attorney
,
Mr.
Gore
,
and
*NL*
mounted
his
horse
to
ride
home
from
Lindum
.
There
was
Furley
,
who
held
*NL*
the
mortgage
on
the
land
,
--
a
reasonable
fellow
,
who
would
see
his
own
*NL*
interest
,
Mr.
Tulliver
was
convinced
,
and
who
would
be
glad
not
only
*NL*
to
purchase
the
whole
estate
,
including
the
mill
and
homestead
,
but
*NL*
would
accept
Mr.
Tulliver
as
tenant
,
and
be
willing
to
advance
money
*NL*
to
be
repaid
with
high
interest
out
of
the
profits
of
the
business
,
*NL*
which
would
be
made
over
to
him
,
Mr.
Tulliver
only
taking
enough
*NL*
barely
to
maintain
himself
and
his
family
.
Who
would
neglect
such
a
*NL*
profitable
investment
?
Certainly
not
Furley
,
for
Mr.
Tulliver
had
*NL*
determined
that
Furley
should
meet
his
plans
with
the
utmost
alacrity
;
*NL*
and
there
are
men
whoses
brains
have
not
yet
been
dangerously
heated
*NL*
by
the
loss
of
a
lawsuit
,
who
are
apt
to
see
in
their
own
interest
or
*NL*
desires
a
motive
for
other
men
's
actions
.
There
was
no
doubt
-LRB-
in
the
*NL*
miller
's
mind
-RRB-
that
Furley
would
do
just
what
was
desirable
;
and
if
he
*NL*
did
--
why
,
things
would
not
be
so
very
much
worse
.
Mr.
Tulliver
and
his
*NL*
family
must
live
more
meagrely
and
humbly
,
but
it
would
only
be
till
*NL*
the
profits
of
the
business
had
paid
off
Furley
's
advances
,
and
that
*NL*
might
be
while
Mr.
Tulliver
had
still
a
good
many
years
of
life
before
*NL*
him
.
It
was
clear
that
the
costs
of
the
suit
could
be
paid
without
his
*NL*
being
obliged
to
turn
out
of
his
old
place
,
and
look
like
a
ruined
*NL*
man
.
It
was
certainly
an
awkward
moment
in
his
affairs
.
There
was
that
*NL*
suretyship
for
poor
Riley
,
who
had
died
suddenly
last
April
,
and
left
*NL*
his
friend
saddled
with
a
debt
of
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
,
--
a
*NL*
fact
which
had
helped
to
make
Mr.
Tulliver
's
banking
book
less
*NL*
pleasant
reading
than
a
man
might
desire
toward
Christmas
.
Well
!
he
*NL*
had
never
been
one
of
those
poor-spirited
sneaks
who
would
refuse
to
*NL*
give
a
helping
hand
to
a
fellow-traveller
in
this
puzzling
world
.
The
*NL*
really
vexatious
business
was
the
fact
that
some
months
ago
the
*NL*
creditor
who
had
lent
him
the
five
hundred
pounds
to
repay
Mrs.
Glegg
*NL*
had
become
uneasy
about
his
money
-LRB-
set
on
by
Wakem
,
of
course
-RRB-
,
and
*NL*
Mr.
Tulliver
,
still
confident
that
he
should
gain
his
suit
,
and
*NL*
finding
it
eminently
inconvenient
to
raise
the
said
sum
until
that
*NL*
desirable
issue
had
taken
place
,
had
rashly
acceded
to
the
demand
that
*NL*
he
should
give
a
bill
of
sale
on
his
household
furniture
and
some
*NL*
other
effects
,
as
security
in
lieu
of
the
bond
.
It
was
all
one
,
he
had
*NL*
said
to
himself
;
he
should
soon
pay
off
the
money
,
and
there
was
no
*NL*
harm
in
giving
that
security
any
more
than
another
.
But
now
the
*NL*
consequences
of
this
bill
of
sale
occurred
to
him
in
a
new
light
,
and
*NL*
he
remembered
that
the
time
was
close
at
hand
when
it
would
be
*NL*
enforced
unless
the
money
were
repaid
.
Two
months
ago
he
would
have
*NL*
declared
stoutly
that
he
would
never
be
beholden
to
his
wife
's
*NL*
friends
;
but
now
he
told
himself
as
stoutly
that
it
was
nothing
but
*NL*
right
and
natural
that
Bessy
should
go
to
the
Pullets
and
explain
the
*NL*
thing
to
them
;
they
would
hardly
let
Bessy
's
furniture
be
sold
,
and
it
*NL*
might
be
security
to
Pullet
if
he
advanced
the
money
,
--
there
would
,
*NL*
after
all
,
be
no
gift
or
favor
in
the
matter
.
Mr.
Tulliver
would
never
*NL*
have
asked
for
anything
from
so
poor-spirited
a
fellow
for
himself
,
*NL*
but
Bessy
might
do
so
if
she
liked
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
precisely
the
proudest
and
most
obstinate
men
who
are
the
most
*NL*
liable
to
shift
their
position
and
contradict
themselves
in
this
*NL*
sudden
manner
;
everything
is
easier
to
them
than
to
face
the
simple
*NL*
fact
that
they
have
been
thoroughly
defeated
,
and
must
begin
life
*NL*
anew
.
And
Mr.
Tulliver
,
you
perceive
,
though
nothing
more
than
a
*NL*
superior
miller
and
maltster
,
was
as
proud
and
obstinate
as
if
he
had
*NL*
been
a
very
lofty
personage
,
in
whom
such
dispositions
might
be
a
*NL*
source
of
that
conspicuous
,
far-echoing
tragedy
,
which
sweeps
the
*NL*
stage
in
regal
robes
,
and
makes
the
dullest
chronicler
sublime
.
The
*NL*
pride
and
obstinacy
of
millers
and
other
insignificant
people
,
whom
*NL*
you
pass
unnoticingly
on
the
road
every
day
,
have
their
tragedy
too
;
*NL*
but
it
is
of
that
unwept
,
hidden
sort
that
goes
on
from
generation
to
*NL*
generation
,
and
leaves
no
record
,
--
such
tragedy
,
perhaps
,
as
lies
in
*NL*
the
conflicts
of
young
souls
,
hungry
for
joy
,
under
a
lot
made
*NL*
suddenly
hard
to
them
,
under
the
dreariness
of
a
home
where
the
*NL*
morning
brings
no
promise
with
it
,
and
where
the
unexpectant
*NL*
discontent
of
worn
and
disappointed
parents
weighs
on
the
children
*NL*
like
a
damp
,
thick
air
,
in
which
all
the
functions
of
life
are
*NL*
depressed
;
or
such
tragedy
as
lies
in
the
slow
or
sudden
death
that
*NL*
follows
on
a
bruised
passion
,
though
it
may
be
a
death
that
finds
only
*NL*
a
parish
funeral
.
There
are
certain
animals
to
which
tenacity
of
*NL*
position
is
a
law
of
life
,
--
they
can
never
flourish
again
,
after
a
*NL*
single
wrench
:
and
there
are
certain
human
beings
to
whom
predominance
*NL*
is
a
law
of
life
,
--
they
can
only
sustain
humiliation
so
long
as
they
*NL*
can
refuse
to
believe
in
it
,
and
,
in
their
own
conception
,
predominate
*NL*
still
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Tulliver
was
still
predominating
,
in
his
own
imagination
,
as
he
*NL*
approached
St.
Ogg
's
,
through
which
he
had
to
pass
on
his
way
*NL*
homeward
.
But
what
was
it
that
suggested
to
him
,
as
he
saw
the
Laceham
*NL*
coach
entering
the
town
,
to
follow
it
to
the
coach-office
,
and
get
the
*NL*
clerk
there
to
write
a
letter
,
requiring
Maggie
to
come
home
the
very
*NL*
next
day
?
Mr.
Tulliver
's
own
hand
shook
too
much
under
his
excitement
*NL*
for
him
to
write
himself
,
and
he
wanted
the
letter
to
be
given
to
the
*NL*
coachman
to
deliver
at
Miss
Firniss
's
school
in
the
morning
.
There
was
*NL*
a
craving
which
he
would
not
account
for
to
himself
,
to
have
Maggie
*NL*
near
him
,
without
delay
,
--
she
must
come
back
by
the
coach
to-morrow
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
when
he
got
home
,
he
would
admit
no
difficulties
,
*NL*
and
scolded
down
her
burst
of
grief
on
hearing
that
the
lawsuit
was
*NL*
lost
,
by
angry
assertions
that
there
was
nothing
to
grieve
about
.
He
*NL*
said
nothing
to
her
that
night
about
the
bill
of
sale
and
the
*NL*
application
to
Mrs.
Pullet
,
for
he
had
kept
her
in
ignorance
of
the
*NL*
nature
of
that
transaction
,
and
had
explained
the
necessity
for
taking
*NL*
an
inventory
of
the
goods
as
a
matter
connected
with
his
will
.
The
*NL*
possession
of
a
wife
conspicuously
one
's
inferior
in
intellect
is
,
*NL*
like
other
high
privileges
,
attended
with
a
few
inconveniences
,
and
,
*NL*
among
the
rest
,
with
the
occasional
necessity
for
using
a
little
*NL*
deception
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
Mr.
Tulliver
was
again
on
horseback
in
the
afternoon
,
on
*NL*
his
way
to
Mr.
Gore
's
office
at
St.
Ogg
's
.
Gore
was
to
have
seen
*NL*
Furley
in
the
morning
,
and
to
have
sounded
him
in
relation
to
Mr.
*NL*
Tulliver
's
affairs
.
But
he
had
not
gone
half-way
when
he
met
a
clerk
*NL*
from
Mr.
Gore
's
office
,
who
was
bringing
a
letter
to
Mr.
Tulliver
.
Mr.
*NL*
Gore
had
been
prevented
by
a
sudden
call
of
business
from
waiting
at
*NL*
his
office
to
see
Mr.
Tulliver
,
according
to
appointment
,
but
would
be
*NL*
at
his
office
at
eleven
to-morrow
morning
,
and
meanwhile
had
sent
some
*NL*
important
information
by
letter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
said
Mr.
Tulliver
,
taking
the
letter
,
but
not
opening
it
.
``
Then
*NL*
tell
Gore
I
'll
see
him
to-morrow
at
eleven
''
;
and
he
turned
his
horse
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
clerk
,
struck
with
Mr.
Tulliver
's
glistening
,
excited
glance
,
*NL*
looked
after
him
for
a
few
moments
,
and
then
rode
away
.
The
reading
of
*NL*
a
letter
was
not
the
affair
of
an
instant
to
Mr.
Tulliver
;
he
took
in
*NL*
the
sense
of
a
statement
very
slowly
through
the
medium
of
written
or
*NL*
even
printed
characters
;
so
he
had
put
the
letter
in
his
pocket
,
*NL*
thinking
he
would
open
it
in
his
armchair
at
home
.
But
by-and-by
it
*NL*
occurred
to
him
that
there
might
be
something
in
the
letter
Mrs.
*NL*
Tulliver
must
not
know
about
,
and
if
so
,
it
would
be
better
to
keep
it
*NL*
out
of
her
sight
altogether
.
He
stopped
his
horse
,
took
out
the
*NL*
letter
,
and
read
it
.
It
was
only
a
short
letter
;
the
substance
was
,
*NL*
that
Mr.
Gore
had
ascertained
,
on
secret
,
but
sure
authority
,
that
*NL*
Furley
had
been
lately
much
straitened
for
money
,
and
had
parted
with
*NL*
his
securities
,
--
among
the
rest
,
the
mortgage
on
Mr.
Tulliver
's
*NL*
property
,
which
he
had
transferred
to
--
Wakem
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
half
an
hour
after
this
Mr.
Tulliver
's
own
wagoner
found
him
lying
*NL*
by
the
roadside
insensible
,
with
an
open
letter
near
him
,
and
his
gray
*NL*
horse
snuffing
uneasily
about
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Maggie
reached
home
that
evening
,
in
obedience
to
her
father
's
*NL*
call
,
he
was
no
longer
insensible
.
About
an
hour
before
he
had
become
*NL*
conscious
,
and
after
vague
,
vacant
looks
around
him
,
had
muttered
*NL*
something
about
``
a
letter
,
''
which
he
presently
repeated
impatiently
.
*NL*
At
the
instance
of
Mr.
Turnbull
,
the
medical
man
,
Gore
's
letter
was
*NL*
brought
and
laid
on
the
bed
,
and
the
previous
impatience
seemed
to
be
*NL*
allayed
.
The
stricken
man
lay
for
some
time
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
*NL*
letter
,
as
if
he
were
trying
to
knit
up
his
thoughts
by
its
help
.
But
*NL*
presently
a
new
wave
of
memory
seemed
to
have
come
and
swept
the
other
*NL*
away
;
he
turned
his
eyes
from
the
letter
to
the
door
,
and
after
*NL*
looking
uneasily
,
as
if
striving
to
see
something
his
eyes
were
too
*NL*
dim
for
,
he
said
,
``
The
little
wench
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
repeated
the
words
impatiently
from
time
to
time
,
appearing
*NL*
entirely
unconscious
of
everything
except
this
one
importunate
want
,
*NL*
and
giving
no
sign
of
knowing
his
wife
or
any
one
else
;
and
poor
Mrs.
*NL*
Tulliver
,
her
feeble
faculties
almost
paralyzed
by
this
sudden
*NL*
accumulation
of
troubles
,
went
backward
and
forward
to
the
gate
to
see
*NL*
if
the
Laceham
coach
were
coming
,
though
it
was
not
yet
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
came
at
last
,
and
set
down
the
poor
anxious
girl
,
no
longer
the
*NL*
``
little
wench
,
''
except
to
her
father
's
fond
memory
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
mother
,
what
is
the
matter
?
''
Maggie
said
,
with
pale
lips
,
as
her
*NL*
mother
came
toward
her
crying
.
She
did
n't
think
her
father
was
ill
,
*NL*
because
the
letter
had
come
at
his
dictation
from
the
office
at
St.
*NL*
Ogg
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Mr.
Turnbull
came
now
to
meet
her
;
a
medical
man
is
the
good
angel
*NL*
of
the
troubled
house
,
and
Maggie
ran
toward
the
kind
old
friend
,
whom
*NL*
she
remembered
as
long
as
she
could
remember
anything
,
with
a
*NL*
trembling
,
questioning
look
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
alarm
yourself
too
much
,
my
dear
,
''
he
said
,
taking
her
hand
.
*NL*
``
Your
father
has
had
a
sudden
attack
,
and
has
not
quite
recovered
his
*NL*
memory
.
But
he
has
been
asking
for
you
,
and
it
will
do
him
good
to
see
*NL*
you
.
Keep
as
quiet
as
you
can
;
take
off
your
things
,
and
come
upstairs
*NL*
with
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
obeyed
,
with
that
terrible
beating
of
the
heart
which
makes
*NL*
existence
seem
simply
a
painful
pulsation
.
The
very
quietness
with
*NL*
which
Mr.
Turnbull
spoke
had
frightened
her
susceptible
imagination
.
*NL*
Her
father
's
eyes
were
still
turned
uneasily
toward
the
door
when
she
*NL*
entered
and
met
the
strange
,
yearning
,
helpless
look
that
had
been
*NL*
seeking
her
in
vain
.
With
a
sudden
flash
and
movement
,
he
raised
*NL*
himself
in
the
bed
;
she
rushed
toward
him
,
and
clasped
him
with
*NL*
agonized
kisses
.
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
child
!
it
was
very
early
for
her
to
know
one
of
those
supreme
*NL*
moments
in
life
when
all
we
have
hoped
or
delighted
in
,
all
we
can
*NL*
dread
or
endure
,
falls
away
from
our
regard
as
insignificant
;
is
lost
,
*NL*
like
a
trivial
memory
,
in
that
simple
,
primitive
love
which
knits
us
*NL*
to
the
beings
who
have
been
nearest
to
us
,
in
their
times
of
*NL*
helplessness
or
of
anguish
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
that
flash
of
recognition
had
been
too
great
a
strain
on
the
*NL*
father
's
bruised
,
enfeebled
powers
.
He
sank
back
again
in
renewed
*NL*
insensibility
and
rigidity
,
which
lasted
for
many
hours
,
and
was
only
*NL*
broken
by
a
flickering
return
of
consciousness
,
in
which
he
took
*NL*
passively
everything
that
was
given
to
him
,
and
seemed
to
have
a
sort
*NL*
of
infantine
satisfaction
in
Maggie
's
near
presence
,
--
such
*NL*
satisfaction
as
a
baby
has
when
it
is
returned
to
the
nurse
's
lap
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Tulliver
sent
for
her
sisters
,
and
there
was
much
wailing
and
*NL*
lifting
up
of
hands
below
stairs
.
Both
uncles
and
aunts
saw
that
the
*NL*
ruin
of
Bessy
and
her
family
was
as
complete
as
they
had
ever
*NL*
foreboded
it
,
and
there
was
a
general
family
sense
that
a
judgment
had
*NL*
fallen
on
Mr.
Tulliver
,
which
it
would
be
an
impiety
to
counteract
by
*NL*
too
much
kindness
.
But
Maggie
heard
little
of
this
,
scarcely
ever
*NL*
leaving
her
father
's
bedside
,
where
she
sat
opposite
him
with
her
hand
*NL*
on
his
.
Mrs.
Tulliver
wanted
to
have
Tom
fetched
home
,
and
seemed
to
*NL*
be
thinking
more
of
her
boy
even
than
of
her
husband
;
but
the
aunts
*NL*
and
uncles
opposed
this
.
Tom
was
better
at
school
,
since
Mr.
Turnbull
*NL*
said
there
was
no
immediate
danger
,
he
believed
.
But
at
the
end
of
the
*NL*
second
day
,
when
Maggie
had
become
more
accustomed
to
her
father
's
*NL*
fits
of
insensibility
,
and
to
the
expectation
that
he
would
revive
*NL*
from
them
,
the
thought
of
Tom
had
become
urgent
with
_
her
_
too
;
and
*NL*
when
her
mother
sate
crying
at
night
and
saying
,
``
My
poor
lad
--
it
's
*NL*
nothing
but
right
he
should
come
home
,
''
Maggie
said
,
``
Let
me
go
for
*NL*
him
,
and
tell
him
,
mother
;
I
'll
go
to-morrow
morning
if
father
does
n't
*NL*
know
me
and
want
me
.
It
would
be
so
hard
for
Tom
to
come
home
and
not
*NL*
know
anything
about
it
beforehand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
next
morning
Maggie
went
,
as
we
have
seen
.
Sitting
on
the
*NL*
coach
on
their
way
home
,
the
brother
and
sister
talked
to
each
other
*NL*
in
sad
,
interrupted
whispers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
say
Mr.
Wakem
has
got
a
mortgage
or
something
on
the
land
,
Tom
,
''
*NL*
said
Maggie
.
``
It
was
the
letter
with
that
news
in
it
that
made
father
*NL*
ill
,
they
think
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
that
scoundrel
's
been
planning
all
along
to
ruin
my
*NL*
father
,
''
said
Tom
,
leaping
from
the
vaguest
impressions
to
a
definite
*NL*
conclusion
.
``
I
'll
make
him
feel
for
it
when
I
'm
a
man
.
Mind
you
never
*NL*
speak
to
Philip
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Tom
!
''
said
Maggie
,
in
a
tone
of
sad
remonstrance
;
but
she
had
no
*NL*
spirit
to
dispute
anything
then
,
still
less
to
vex
Tom
by
opposing
*NL*
him
.

Chapter
II
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Tulliver
's
Teraphim
,
or
Household
Gods
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
coach
set
down
Tom
and
Maggie
,
it
was
five
hours
since
she
*NL*
had
started
from
home
,
and
she
was
thinking
with
some
trembling
that
*NL*
her
father
had
perhaps
missed
her
,
and
asked
for
``
the
little
wench
''
in
*NL*
vain
.
She
thought
of
no
other
change
that
might
have
happened
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
hurried
along
the
gravel-walk
and
entered
the
house
before
Tom
;
*NL*
but
in
the
entrance
she
was
startled
by
a
strong
smell
of
tobacco
.
The
*NL*
parlor
door
was
ajar
;
that
was
where
the
smell
came
from
.
It
was
very
*NL*
strange
;
could
any
visitor
be
smoking
at
a
time
like
this
?
Was
her
*NL*
mother
there
?
If
so
,
she
must
be
told
that
Tom
was
come
.
Maggie
,
after
*NL*
this
pause
of
surprise
,
was
only
in
the
act
of
opening
the
door
when
*NL*
Tom
came
up
,
and
they
both
looked
into
the
parlor
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
coarse
,
dingy
man
,
of
whose
face
Tom
had
some
vague
*NL*
recollection
,
sitting
in
his
father
's
chair
,
smoking
,
with
a
jug
and
*NL*
glass
beside
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
truth
flashed
on
Tom
's
mind
in
an
instant
.
To
``
have
the
bailiff
in
*NL*
the
house
,
''
and
``
to
be
sold
up
,
''
were
phrases
which
he
had
been
used
*NL*
to
,
even
as
a
little
boy
;
they
were
part
of
the
disgrace
and
misery
of
*NL*
``
failing
,
''
of
losing
all
one
's
money
,
and
being
ruined
,
--
sinking
into
*NL*
the
condition
of
poor
working
people
.
It
seemed
only
natural
this
*NL*
should
happen
,
since
his
father
had
lost
all
his
property
,
and
he
*NL*
thought
of
no
more
special
cause
for
this
particular
form
of
*NL*
misfortune
than
the
loss
of
the
lawsuit
.
But
the
immediate
presence
of
*NL*
this
disgrace
was
so
much
keener
an
experience
to
Tom
than
the
worst
*NL*
form
of
apprehension
,
that
he
felt
at
this
moment
as
if
his
real
*NL*
trouble
had
only
just
begin
;
it
was
a
touch
on
the
irritated
nerve
*NL*
compared
with
its
spontaneous
dull
aching
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
do
,
sir
?
''
said
the
man
,
taking
the
pipe
out
of
his
mouth
,
*NL*
with
rough
,
embarrassed
civility
.
The
two
young
startled
faces
made
*NL*
him
a
little
uncomfortable
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Tom
turned
away
hastily
without
speaking
;
the
sight
was
too
*NL*
hateful
.
Maggie
had
not
understood
the
appearance
of
this
stranger
,
as
*NL*
Tom
had
.
She
followed
him
,
whispering
:
``
Who
can
it
be
,
Tom
?
What
is
*NL*
the
matter
?
''
Then
,
with
a
sudden
undefined
dread
lest
this
stranger
*NL*
might
have
something
to
do
with
a
change
in
her
father
,
she
rushed
*NL*
upstairs
,
checking
herself
at
the
bedroom
door
to
throw
off
her
*NL*
bonnet
,
and
enter
on
tiptoe
.
All
was
silent
there
;
her
father
was
*NL*
lying
,
heedless
of
everything
around
him
,
with
his
eyes
closed
as
when
*NL*
she
had
left
him
.
A
servant
was
there
,
but
not
her
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
's
my
mother
?
''
she
whispered
.
The
servant
did
not
know
.
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
hastened
out
,
and
said
to
Tom
;
``
Father
is
lying
quiet
;
let
us
*NL*
go
and
look
for
my
mother
.
I
wonder
where
she
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Tulliver
was
not
downstairs
,
not
in
any
of
the
bedrooms
.
There
*NL*
was
but
one
room
below
the
attic
which
Maggie
had
left
unsearched
;
it
*NL*
was
the
storeroom
,
where
her
mother
kept
all
her
linen
and
all
the
*NL*
precious
``
best
things
''
that
were
only
unwrapped
and
brought
out
on
*NL*
special
occasions
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
,
preceding
Maggie
,
as
they
returned
along
the
passage
,
opened
the
*NL*
door
of
this
room
,
and
immediately
said
,
``
Mother
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Tulliver
was
seated
there
with
all
her
laid-up
treasures
.
One
of
*NL*
the
linen
chests
was
open
;
the
silver
teapot
was
unwrapped
from
its
*NL*
many
folds
of
paper
,
and
the
best
china
was
laid
out
on
the
top
of
the
*NL*
closed
linen-chest
;
spoons
and
skewers
and
ladles
were
spread
in
rows
*NL*
on
the
shelves
;
and
the
poor
woman
was
shaking
her
head
and
weeping
,
*NL*
with
a
bitter
tension
of
the
mouth
,
over
the
mark
,
``
Elizabeth
Dodson
,
''
*NL*
on
the
corner
of
some
tablecloths
she
held
in
her
lap
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
dropped
them
,
and
started
up
as
Tom
spoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
boy
,
my
boy
!
''
she
said
,
clasping
him
round
the
neck
.
``
To
think
*NL*
as
I
should
live
to
see
this
day
!
We
're
ruined
--
everything
's
going
to
*NL*
be
sold
up
--
to
think
as
your
father
should
ha
'
married
me
to
bring
me
*NL*
to
this
!
We
've
got
nothing
--
we
shall
be
beggars
--
we
must
go
to
the
*NL*
workhouse
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
kissed
him
,
then
seated
herself
again
,
and
took
another
tablecloth
*NL*
on
her
lap
,
unfolding
it
a
little
way
to
look
at
the
pattern
,
while
*NL*
the
children
stood
by
in
mute
wretchedness
,
their
minds
quite
filled
*NL*
for
the
moment
with
the
words
``
beggars
''
and
``
workhouse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
think
o
'
these
cloths
as
I
spun
myself
,
''
she
went
on
,
lifting
*NL*
things
out
and
turning
them
over
with
an
excitement
all
the
more
*NL*
strange
and
piteous
because
the
stout
blond
woman
was
usually
so
*NL*
passive
,
--
if
she
had
been
ruffled
before
,
it
was
at
the
surface
*NL*
merely
,
--
``
and
Job
Haxey
wove
'em
,
and
brought
the
piece
home
on
his
*NL*
back
,
as
I
remember
standing
at
the
door
and
seeing
him
come
,
before
I
*NL*
ever
thought
o
'
marrying
your
father
!
And
the
pattern
as
I
chose
*NL*
myself
,
and
bleached
so
beautiful
,
and
I
marked
'em
so
as
nobody
ever
*NL*
saw
such
marking
,
--
they
must
cut
the
cloth
to
get
it
out
,
for
it
's
a
*NL*
particular
stitch
.
And
they
're
all
to
be
sold
,
and
go
into
strange
*NL*
people
's
houses
,
and
perhaps
be
cut
with
the
knives
,
and
wore
out
*NL*
before
I
'm
dead
.
You
'll
never
have
one
of
'em
,
my
boy

she
said
,
*NL*
looking
up
at
Tom
with
her
eyes
full
of
tears
,
``
and
I
meant
'em
for
*NL*
you
.
I
wanted
you
to
have
all
o
'
this
pattern

Maggie
could
have
had
*NL*
the
large
check
--
it
never
shows
so
well
when
the
dishes
are
on
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
was
touched
to
the
quick
,
but
there
was
an
angry
reaction
*NL*
immediately
.
His
face
flushed
as
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
will
my
aunts
let
them
be
sold
,
mother
?
Do
they
know
about
it
?
*NL*
They
'll
never
let
your
linen
go
,
will
they
?
Have
n't
you
sent
to
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
sent
Luke
directly
they
'd
put
the
bailies
in

and
your
aunt

been

and
,
oh
dear
,
oh
dear

she
cries
so
and
says
your
*NL*
father
's
disgraced
my
family
and
made
it
the
talk

the
country
;
and
*NL*
she
'll
buy
the
spotted
cloths
for
herself
,
because
she

never
had
so
*NL*
many
as
she
wanted
o

that

got
more
checks

''
-LRB-
Here
Mrs.
*NL*
Tulliver
began
to
lay
back
the
tablecloths
in
the
chest
,
folding
and
*NL*
stroking
them
automatically
.
-RRB-
``
And
your
uncle
Glegg
's
been
too
,
and
he
*NL*
says
things
must
be
bought
in
for
us
to
lie
down
on
,
but
he
must
talk
*NL*
to
your
aunt
;
and
they
're
all
coming
to
consult
.
But
I
know
they
'll
*NL*
none
of
'em
take
my
chany

''
she
added
,
turning
toward
the
cups
and
*NL*
saucers
,
``
for
they
all
found
fault
with
'em
when
I
bought
'em

'cause

the
small
gold
sprig
all
over
'em
,
between
the
flowers
.
But
there
's
*NL*
none
of
'em
got
better
chany

not
even
your
aunt
Pullet
herself

I

bought

fifteen

never
paid
for
'em

*NL*
And
to
think
as
he
should
ha

married
me
,
and
brought
me
to
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Tulliver
burst
out
crying
afresh
,
and
she
sobbed
with
her
*NL*
handkerchief
at
her
eyes
a
few
moments
,
but
then
removing
it
,
she
said
*NL*
in
a
deprecating
way
,
still
half
sobbing
,
as
if
she
were
called
upon
*NL*
to
speak
before
she
could
command
her
voice
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
_
did
_
say
to
him
times
and
times
,
`
Whativer
you
do
,
do
n't
go
to
*NL*
law
,
'
and
what
more
could
I
do
?
I
've
had
to
sit
by
while
my
own
*NL*
fortin
's
been
spent
,
and
what
should
ha
'
been
my
children
's
,
too
.
*NL*
You
'll
have
niver
a
penny
,
my
boy
--
but
it
is
n't
your
poor
mother
's
*NL*
fault
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
put
out
one
arm
toward
Tom
,
looking
up
at
him
piteously
with
her
*NL*
helpless
,
childish
blue
eyes
.
The
poor
lad
went
to
her
and
kissed
her
,
*NL*
and
she
clung
to
him
.
For
the
first
time
Tom
thought
of
his
father
*NL*
with
some
reproach
.
His
natural
inclination
to
blame
,
hitherto
kept
*NL*
entirely
in
abeyance
toward
his
father
by
the
predisposition
to
think
*NL*
him
always
right
,
simply
on
the
ground
that
he
was
Tom
Tulliver
's
*NL*
father
,
was
turned
into
this
new
channel
by
his
mother
's
plaints
;
and
*NL*
with
his
indignation
against
Wakem
there
began
to
mingle
some
*NL*
indignation
of
another
sort
.
Perhaps
his
father
might
have
helped
*NL*
bringing
them
all
down
in
the
world
,
and
making
people
talk
of
them
*NL*
with
contempt
,
but
no
one
should
talk
long
of
Tom
Tulliver
with
*NL*
contempt
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
natural
strength
and
firmness
of
his
nature
was
beginning
to
*NL*
assert
itself
,
urged
by
the
double
stimulus
of
resentment
against
his
*NL*
aunts
,
and
the
sense
that
he
must
behave
like
a
man
and
take
care
of
*NL*
his
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
fret
,
mother
,
''
he
said
tenderly
.
``
I
shall
soon
be
able
to
get
*NL*
money
;
I
'll
get
a
situation
of
some
sort
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bless
you
,
my
boy
!
''
said
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
a
little
soothed
.
Then
,
*NL*
looking
round
sadly
,
``
But
I
should
n't
ha
'
minded
so
much
if
we
could
*NL*
ha
'
kept
the
things
wi
'
my
name
on
'em
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
had
witnessed
this
scene
with
gathering
anger
.
The
implied
*NL*
reproaches
against
her
father
--
her
father
,
who
was
lying
there
in
a
*NL*
sort
of
living
death
--
neutralized
all
her
pity
for
griefs
about
*NL*
tablecloths
and
china
;
and
her
anger
on
her
father
's
account
was
*NL*
heightened
by
some
egoistic
resentment
at
Tom
's
silent
concurrence
*NL*
with
her
mother
in
shutting
her
out
from
the
common
calamity
.
She
had
*NL*
become
almost
indifferent
to
her
mother
's
habitual
depreciation
of
*NL*
her
,
but
she
was
keenly
alive
to
any
sanction
of
it
,
however
passive
,
*NL*
that
she
might
suspect
in
Tom
.
Poor
Maggie
was
by
no
means
made
up
of
*NL*
unalloyed
devotedness
,
but
put
forth
large
claims
for
herself
where
*NL*
she
loved
strongly
.
She
burst
out
at
last
in
an
agitated
,
almost
*NL*
violent
tone
:
``
Mother
,
how
can
you
talk
so
;
as
if
you
cared
only
for
*NL*
things
with
_
your
_
name
on
,
and
not
for
what
has
my
father
's
name
too
;
*NL*
and
to
care
about
anything
but
dear
father
himself
!
--
when
he
's
lying
*NL*
there
,
and
may
never
speak
to
us
again
.
Tom
,
you
ought
to
say
so
too
;
*NL*
you
ought
not
to
let
any
one
find
fault
with
my
father
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
,
almost
choked
with
mingled
grief
and
anger
,
left
the
room
,
and
*NL*
took
her
old
place
on
her
father
's
bed
.
Her
heart
went
out
to
him
with
*NL*
a
stronger
movement
than
ever
,
at
the
thought
that
people
would
blame
*NL*
him
.
Maggie
hated
blame
;
she
had
been
blamed
all
her
life
,
and
nothing
*NL*
had
come
of
it
but
evil
tempers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
father
had
always
defended
and
excused
her
,
and
her
loving
*NL*
remembrance
of
his
tenderness
was
a
force
within
her
that
would
enable
*NL*
her
to
do
or
bear
anything
for
his
sake
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
was
a
little
shocked
at
Maggie
's
outburst
,
--
telling
_
him
_
as
well
*NL*
as
his
mother
what
it
was
right
to
do
!
She
ought
to
have
learned
*NL*
better
than
have
those
hectoring
,
assuming
manners
,
by
this
time
.
But
*NL*
he
presently
went
into
his
father
's
room
,
and
the
sight
there
touched
*NL*
him
in
a
way
that
effaced
the
slighter
impressions
of
the
previous
*NL*
hour
.
When
Maggie
saw
how
he
was
moved
,
she
went
to
him
and
put
her
*NL*
arm
round
his
neck
as
he
sat
by
the
bed
,
and
the
two
children
forgot
*NL*
everything
else
in
the
sense
that
they
had
one
father
and
one
sorrow
.

Chapter

*NL*
The
Family
Council
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
at
eleven
o'clock
the
next
morning
that
the
aunts
and
uncles
*NL*
came
to
hold
their
consultation
.
The
fire
was
lighted
in
the
large
*NL*
parlor
,
and
poor
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
with
a
confused
impression
that
it
was
*NL*
a
great
occasion
,
like
a
funeral
,
unbagged
the
bell-rope
tassels
,
and
*NL*
unpinned
the
curtains
,
adjusting
them
in
proper
folds
,
looking
round
*NL*
and
shaking
her
head
sadly
at
the
polished
tops
and
legs
of
the
*NL*
tables
,
which
sister
Pullet
herself
could
not
accuse
of
insufficient
*NL*
brightness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Deane
was
not
coming
,
he
was
away
on
business
;
but
Mrs.
Deane
*NL*
appeared
punctually
in
that
handsome
new
gig
with
the
head
to
it
,
and
*NL*
the
livery-servant
driving
it
,
which
had
thrown
so
clear
a
light
on
*NL*
several
traits
in
her
character
to
some
of
her
female
friends
in
St.
*NL*
Ogg
's
.
Mr.
Deane
had
been
advancing
in
the
world
as
rapidly
as
Mr.
*NL*
Tulliver
had
been
going
down
in
it
;
and
in
Mrs.
Deane
's
house
the
*NL*
Dodson
linen
and
plate
were
beginning
to
hold
quite
a
subordinate
*NL*
position
,
as
a
mere
supplement
to
the
handsomer
articles
of
the
same
*NL*
kind
,
purchased
in
recent
years
,
--
a
change
which
had
caused
an
*NL*
occasional
coolness
in
the
sisterly
intercourse
between
her
and
Mrs.
*NL*
Glegg
,
who
felt
that
Susan
was
getting
``
like
the
rest
,
''
and
there
*NL*
would
soon
be
little
of
the
true
Dodson
spirit
surviving
except
in
*NL*
herself
,
and
,
it
might
be
hoped
,
in
those
nephews
who
supported
the
*NL*
Dodson
name
on
the
family
land
,
far
away
in
the
Wolds
.
*NL*
*NL*
People
who
live
at
a
distance
are
naturally
less
faulty
than
those
*NL*
immediately
under
our
own
eyes
;
and
it
seems
superfluous
,
when
we
*NL*
consider
the
remote
geographical
position
of
the
Ethiopians
,
and
how
*NL*
very
little
the
Greeks
had
to
do
with
them
,
to
inquire
further
why
*NL*
Homer
calls
them
``
blameless
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Deane
was
the
first
to
arrive
;
and
when
she
had
taken
her
seat
in
*NL*
the
large
parlor
,
Mrs.
Tulliver
came
down
to
her
with
her
comely
face
*NL*
a
little
distorted
,
nearly
as
it
would
have
been
if
she
had
been
*NL*
crying
.
She
was
not
a
woman
who
could
shed
abundant
tears
,
except
in
*NL*
moments
when
the
prospect
of
losing
her
furniture
became
unusually
*NL*
vivid
,
but
she
felt
how
unfitting
it
was
to
be
quite
calm
under
*NL*
present
circumstances
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
sister
,
what
a
world
this
is
!
''
she
exclaimed
as
she
entered
;
*NL*
``
what
trouble
,
oh
dear
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Deane
was
a
thin-lipped
woman
,
who
made
small
well-considered
*NL*
speeches
on
peculiar
occasions
,
repeating
them
afterward
to
her
*NL*
husband
,
and
asking
him
if
she
had
not
spoken
very
properly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sister
,
''
she
said
deliberately
,
``
this
is
a
changing
world
,
and
*NL*
we
do
n't
know
to-day
what
may
happen
tomorrow
.
But
it
's
right
to
be
*NL*
prepared
for
all
things
,
and
if
trouble
's
sent
,
to
remember
as
it
*NL*
is
n't
sent
without
a
cause
.
I
'm
very
sorry
for
you
as
a
sister
,
and
if
*NL*
the
doctor
orders
jelly
for
Mr.
Tulliver
,
I
hope
you
'll
let
me
know
.
*NL*
I
'll
send
it
willingly
;
for
it
is
but
right
he
should
have
proper
*NL*
attendance
while
he
's
ill
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
Susan
,
''
said
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
rather
faintly
,
withdrawing
*NL*
her
fat
hand
from
her
sister
's
thin
one
.
``
But
there
's
been
no
talk
o
'
*NL*
jelly
yet
.
''
Then
after
a
moment
's
pause
she
added
,
``
There
's
a
dozen
o
'
*NL*
cut
jelly-glasses
upstairs
--
I
shall
never
put
jelly
into
'em
no
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
voice
was
rather
agitated
as
she
uttered
the
last
words
,
but
the
*NL*
sound
of
wheels
diverted
her
thoughts
.
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Glegg
were
come
,
*NL*
and
were
almost
immediately
followed
by
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Pullet
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Pullet
entered
crying
,
as
a
compendious
mode
,
at
all
times
,
of
*NL*
expressing
what
were
her
views
of
life
in
general
,
and
what
,
in
brief
,
*NL*
were
the
opinions
she
held
concerning
the
particular
case
before
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Glegg
had
on
her
fuzziest
front
,
and
garments
which
appeared
to
*NL*
have
had
a
recent
resurrection
from
rather
a
creasy
form
of
burial
;
a
*NL*
costume
selected
with
the
high
moral
purpose
of
instilling
perfect
*NL*
humility
into
Bessy
and
her
children
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mrs.
G.
,
wo
n't
you
come
nearer
the
fire
?
''
said
her
husband
,
unwilling
*NL*
to
take
the
more
comfortable
seat
without
offering
it
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
I
've
seated
myself
here
,
Mr.
Glegg
,
''
returned
this
superior
*NL*
woman
;
''
_
you
_
can
roast
yourself
,
if
you
like
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Mr.
Glegg
,
seating
himself
good-humoredly
,
``
and
how
's
the
*NL*
poor
man
upstairs
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dr.
Turnbull
thought
him
a
deal
better
this
morning
,
''
said
Mrs.
*NL*
Tulliver
;
``
he
took
more
notice
,
and
spoke
to
me
;
but
he
's
never
known
*NL*
Tom
yet

--
looks
at
the
poor
lad
as
if
he
was
a
stranger
,
though
he
*NL*
said
something
once
about
Tom
and
the
pony
.
The
doctor
says
his
*NL*
memory
's
gone
a
long
way
back
,
and
he
does
n't
know
Tom
because
he
's
*NL*
thinking
of
him
when
he
was
little
.
Eh
dear
,
eh
dear
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
doubt
it
's
the
water
got
on
his
brain
,
''
said
aunt
Pullet
,
turning
*NL*
round
from
adjusting
her
cap
in
a
melancholy
way
at
the
pier-glass
.
*NL*
``
It
's
much
if
he
ever
gets
up
again
;
and
if
he
does
,
he
'll
most
like
*NL*
be
childish
,
as
Mr.
Carr
was
,
poor
man
!
They
fed
him
with
a
spoon
as
*NL*
if
he
'd
been
a
babby
for
three
year
.
He
'd
quite
lost
the
use
of
his
*NL*
limbs
;
but
then
he
'd
got
a
Bath
chair
,
and
somebody
to
draw
him
;
and
*NL*
that
's
what
you
wo
n't
have
,
I
doubt
,
Bessy

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sister
Pullet
,
''
said
Mrs.
Glegg
,
severely
,
``
if
I
understand
right

this
morning

in

drawing
on

gloves
again

and
stroking
the
fingers
in
an
agitated
manner

``

she
added

with
a
*NL*
sigh

*NL*
they
're
pretty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
've
no
objection
to
buy
some
of
the
best
things
,
''
said
Mrs.
*NL*
Deane
,
rather
loftily
;
``
we
can
do
with
extra
things
in
our
house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Best
things
!
''
exclaimed
Mrs.
Glegg
,
with
severity
,
which
had
gathered
*NL*
intensity
from
her
long
silence
.
``
It
drives
me
past
patience
to
hear
*NL*
you
all
talking
o
'
best
things
,
and
buying
in
this
,
that
,
and
the
*NL*
other
,
such
as
silver
and
chany
.
You
must
bring
your
mind
to
your
*NL*
circumstances
,
Bessy
,
and
not
be
thinking
o
'
silver
and
chany
;
but
*NL*
whether
you
shall
get
so
much
as
a
flock-bed
to
lie
on
,
and
a
blanket
*NL*
to
cover
you
,
and
a
stool
to
sit
on
.
You
must
remember
,
if
you
get
*NL*
'em
,
it
'll
be
because
your
friends
have
bought
'em
for
you
,
for
you
're
*NL*
dependent
upon
_
them
_
for
everything
;
for
your
husband
lies
there
*NL*
helpless
,
and
has
n't
got
a
penny
i
'
the
world
to
call
his
own
.
And
*NL*
it
's
for
your
own
good
I
say
this
,
for
it
's
right
you
should
feel
what
*NL*
your
state
is
,
and
what
disgrace
your
husband
's
brought
on
your
own
*NL*
family
,
as
you
've
got
to
look
to
for
everything
,
and
be
humble
in
your
*NL*
mind

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Glegg
paused
,
for
speaking
with
much
energy
for
the
good
of
*NL*
others
is
naturally
exhausting
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
always
borne
down
by
the
family
predominance
of
sister
*NL*
Jane
,
who
had
made
her
wear
the
yoke
of
a
younger
sister
in
very
*NL*
tender
years
,
said
pleadingly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sure

I
've
never
asked
anybody
to

anything

only
buy
*NL*

it
`

be
a
pleasure
to
'em
to
have
,
so
as
they
might
n't
go
*NL*
and
be
spoiled
i
'
strange
houses

I
never
asked
anybody
to
buy
the
*NL*
things
in
for
me
and
my
children
;
though
there
's
the
linen
I
spun
,
and
*NL*
I
thought
when
Tom
was
born
,

I
thought
one
o

the
first
things
when
*NL*
he
was
lying
i

the
cradle
,
as
all
the
things
I
'd
bought
wi

my
own
*NL*
money
,
and
been
so
careful
of
,
`

go
to
him

But
I
've
said
nothing
as
*NL*
I
wanted
my

to
pay
their
money
for
me

What
my
husband
has
*NL*
done
for
_
his

sister
's
unknown
,
and
we
should
ha
'
been
better
off
*NL*
this
day
if
it
had
n't
been
as
he
's
lent
money

never
asked
for
it
*NL*
again

*NL*
*NL*
``
Come

Mr.

kindly

``
do

Mrs.

they
must

useful

said

uncle
Pullet

who
became
unusually
suggestive
where

were
concerned

*NL*
``
Yes

Mrs.

*NL*
``

at

mention

``
They

me

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
Mrs.

,
``
the

it

right

talk

let

know
*NL*
their
condition
i

life
,
and
what
they

come
down

for

faults

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
'll
go
and
fetch
'em

''
said
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
resignedly
.
*NL*
She
was
quite
crushed
now
,
and
thought
of
the
treasures
in
the
*NL*
storeroom
with
no
other
feeling
than
blank
despair
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
went
upstairs
to
fetch
Tom
and
Maggie
,
who
were
both
in
their
*NL*
father
's
room
,
and
was
on
her
way
down
again
,
when
the
sight
of
the
*NL*
storeroom
door
suggested
a
new
thought
to
her
.
She
went
toward
it
,
and
*NL*
left
the
children
to
go
down
by
themselves
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
aunts
and
uncles
appeared
to
have
been
in
warm
discussion
when
the
*NL*
brother
and
sister
entered
,
--
both
with
shrinking
reluctance
;
for
*NL*
though
Tom
,
with
a
practical
sagacity
which
had
been
roused
into
*NL*
activity
by
the
strong
stimulus
of
the
new
emotions
he
had
undergone
*NL*
since
yesterday
,
had
been
turning
over
in
his
mind
a
plan
which
he
*NL*
meant
to
propose
to
one
of
his
aunts
or
uncles
,
he
felt
by
no
means
*NL*
amicably
toward
them
,
and
dreaded
meeting
them
all
at
once
as
he
would
*NL*
have
dreaded
a
large
dose
of
concentrated
physic
,
which
was
but
just
*NL*
endurable
in
small
draughts
.
As
for
Maggie
,
she
was
peculiarly
*NL*
depressed
this
morning
;
she
had
been
called
up
,
after
brief
rest
,
at
*NL*
three
o'clock
,
and
had
that
strange
dreamy
weariness
which
comes
from
*NL*
watching
in
a
sick-room
through
the
chill
hours
of
early
twilight
and
*NL*
breaking
day
,
--
in
which
the
outside
day-light
life
seems
to
have
no
*NL*
importance
,
and
to
be
a
mere
margin
to
the
hours
in
the
darkened
*NL*
chamber
.
Their
entrance
interrupted
the
conversation
.
The
shaking
of
*NL*
hands
was
a
melancholy
and
silent
ceremony
,
till
uncle
Pullet
*NL*
observed
,
as
Tom
approached
him
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
young
sir
,
we
've
been
talking
as
we
should
want
your
pen
and
*NL*
ink
;
you
can
write
rarely
now
,
after
all
your
schooling
,
I
should
*NL*
think
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
ay
,
''
said
uncle
Glegg
,
with
admonition
which
he
meant
to
be
kind
,
*NL*
``
we
must
look
to
see
the
good
of
all
this
schooling
,
as
your
father
's
*NL*
sunk
so
much
money
in
,
now
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
`
When
land
is
gone
and
money
's
spent
,
*NL*
Then
learning
is
most
excellent
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Now
's
the
time
,
Tom
,
to
let
us
see
the
good
o
'
your
learning
.
Let
us
*NL*
see
whether
you
can
do
better
than
I
can
,
as
have
made
my
fortin
*NL*
without
it
.
But
I
began
wi
'
doing
with
little
,
you
see
;
I
could
live
*NL*
on
a
basin
o
'
porridge
and
a
crust
o
'
bread-and-cheese
.
But
I
doubt
*NL*
high
living
and
high
learning
`
ull
make
it
harder
for
you
,
young
man
,
*NL*
nor
it
was
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
he
must
do
it
,
''
interposed
aunt
Glegg
,
energetically
,
``
whether
*NL*
it
's
hard
or
no
.
He
has
n't
got
to
consider
what
's
hard
;
he
must
*NL*
consider
as
he
is
n't
to
trusten
to
his
friends
to
keep
him
in
idleness
*NL*
and
luxury
;
he
's
got
to
bear
the
fruits
of
his
father
's
misconduct
,
*NL*
and
bring
his
mind
to
fare
hard
and
to
work
hard
.
And
he
must
be
*NL*
humble
and
grateful
to
his
aunts
and
uncles
for
what
they
're
doing
for
*NL*
his
mother
and
father
,
as
must
be
turned
out
into
the
streets
and
go
*NL*
to
the
workhouse
if
they
did
n't
help
'em
.
And
his
sister
,
too

''
*NL*
continued
Mrs.
Glegg
,
looking
severely
at
Maggie
,
who
had
sat
down
on
*NL*
the
sofa
by
her
aunt
Deane
,
drawn
to
her
by
the
sense
that
she
was
*NL*
Lucy
's
mother
,
``
she
must
make
up
her
mind
to
be
humble
and
work

for
*NL*
there
'll
be
no
servants

wait
on
her
any
more
,
--
she
must
remember
*NL*
that

She
must
do
the
work
o

the
house

and
she
must
respect
and
love
*NL*
her
aunts
as
have
done
so
much

saved
their

*NL*
*NL*
Tom
was
still
standing
before
the
table
in
the
centre
of
the
group
.
*NL*
There
was
a
heightened
color
in
his
face
,
and
he
was
very
far
from
*NL*
looking
humbled
,
but
he
was
preparing
to
say
,
in
a
respectful
tone
,
*NL*
something
he
had
previously
meditated
,
when
the
door
opened
and
his
*NL*
mother
re-entered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Mrs.
Tulliver
had
in
her
hands
a
small
tray
,
on
which
she
had
*NL*
placed
her
silver
teapot
,
a
specimen
teacup
and
saucer
,
the
castors
,
*NL*
and
sugar-tongs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
See
here

''
she
said
,
looking
at
Mrs.
Deane
,
as
she
set
the
*NL*
tray
on
the
table
,
``
I
thought
,
perhaps
,
if
you
looked
at
the
teapot
*NL*
again
,

it
's
a
good
while
since
you
saw
it

you
might
like
the
*NL*
pattern
better
;
it
makes
beautiful
tea
,
and
there
's
a
stand
and
*NL*
everything

you
might
use
it
for
every

else
lay
it
by

goes
to
housekeeping

I

Golden
Lion

said
the
poor
woman
,
her
heart
swelling
,
and
the
*NL*
tears
coming
,

``
my
teapot

*NL*
``

Pullet
,
shaking
her
head
with
deep

sadness

said
Mrs.

*NL*
Maggie
had
started
up
from
the
sofa
at
the
allusion
to
her
father
,
but
*NL*
Tom
saw
her
action
and
flushed
face
in
time
to
prevent
her
from
*NL*
speaking
.
``
Be
quiet

Maggie

he
said
authoritatively
,
pushing
her
*NL*
aside
.
It
was
a
remarkable
manifestation
of
self-command
and
practical
*NL*
judgment
in
a
lad
of
fifteen
,
that
when
his
aunt
Glegg
ceased
,
he
*NL*
began
to
speak
in
a
quiet
and
respectful
manner
,
though
with
a
good
*NL*
deal
of
trembling
in
his
voice
;
for
his
mother
's
words
had
cut
him
to
*NL*
the
quick
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
aunt
,
''
he
said
,
looking
straight
at
Mrs.
Glegg
,
``
if
you
think
*NL*
it
's
a
disgrace
to
the
family
that
we
should
be
sold
up
,
would
n't
it
*NL*
be
better
to
prevent
it
altogether
?
And
if
you
and
aunt
Pullet
,
''
he
*NL*
continued
,
looking
at
the
latter
,
``
think
of
leaving
any
money
to
me
*NL*
and
Maggie

n't
it
be
better
to
give

now
,
and
pay
the
debt
*NL*

're
going
to
be
sold
up
for

and
save
my
mother
from
parting
with

''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
silence
for
a
few
moments
,
for
every
one
,
including
Maggie
,
*NL*
was
astonished
at
Tom
's
sudden
manliness
of
tone
.
Uncle
Glegg
was
the
*NL*
first
to
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
ay
,
young
man
,
come
now
!
You
show
some
notion
o

things
.
But
*NL*
there
's
the
interest
,
you
must
remember
;
your
aunts
get
five
per
cent
*NL*
on
their
money
,
and
they
'd
lose
that
if
they
advanced
it
;
you
have
n't
*NL*
thought
o
'
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
work
and
pay
that
every
year

''
said
Tom
,
promptly
.
``
I
'd
do
*NL*
anything
to
save
my
mother
from
parting
with
her
things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
done
!
''
said
uncle
Glegg
,
admiringly
.
He
had
been
drawing
Tom
*NL*
out
,
rather
than
reflecting
on
the
practicability
of
his
proposal
.
But
*NL*
he
had
produced
the
unfortunate
result
of
irritating
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Mr.
Glegg
!
''
said
that
lady
,
with
angry
sarcasm
.
``
It
's
pleasant
*NL*
work
for
you
to
be
giving
my
money
away

you

*NL*
at
my

And
my
money
,
as
was
my
own
father

gift
,

not
*NL*
yours

Mr.
Glegg
;
and
I
've
saved
it
,
and
added
to
it
myself
,
and
had
*NL*
more
to
put
out
almost
every
year
,
and
it
's
to
go
and
be
sunk
in
other
*NL*
folks

furniture
,
and
encourage
'em
in
luxury
and
extravagance
as
*NL*
they
've
no
means
of
supporting
;
and
I
'm
to
alter
my
will

have
a
*NL*
codicil
made

leave
two

three
hundred

behind
me

me

*NL*
``

said
Mrs.

*NL*
``
Why

this
to

said
Mr.

.
``
It

*NL*
*NL*
``
Then

said
his
wife
,
with
slow

loud
*NL*
emphasis
,
bending
her
head
toward
him
significantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
's
countenance
had
fallen
during
this
conversation
,
and
his
lip
*NL*
quivered
;
but
he
was
determined
not
to
give
way
.
He
would
behave
like
*NL*
a
man
.
Maggie
,
on
the
contrary
,
after
her
momentary
delight
in
Tom
's
*NL*
speech
,
had
relapsed
into
her
state
of
trembling
indignation
.
Her
*NL*
mother
had
been
standing
close
by
Tom
's
side
,
and
had
been
clinging
to
*NL*
his
arm
ever
since
he
had
last
spoken
;
Maggie
suddenly
started
up
and
*NL*
stood
in
front
of
them
,
her
eyes
flashing
like
the
eyes
of
a
young
*NL*
lioness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

then
,
''
she
burst
out
,

*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
,
having
hurled
her
defiance
at
aunts

uncles
in
this
way
,
*NL*
stood
still
,
with
her
large
dark
eyes
glaring
at

,
as
if
she
were
*NL*
ready
to
await
all
consequences

*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Tulliver
was
frightened
;
there
was
something
portentous
in
this
*NL*
mad
outbreak
;
she
did
not
see
how
life
could
go
on
after
it
.
Tom
was
*NL*
vexed
;
it
was
no
_
use

to
talk
so
.
The
aunts
were
silent
with
surprise
*NL*
for
some
moments
.
At
length
,
in
a
case
of
aberration
such
as
this
,
*NL*
comment
presented
itself
as
more
expedient
than
any
answer

*NL*
*NL*
``

Mrs.

*NL*
*NL*
``
It

Mrs.

``
Other

again

I

my

*NL*
*NL*
While
Mr.

was
speaking
,
a
tall
dark
figure
was
seen
hurrying
*NL*
past
the
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
there

Mrs.

said
Mrs.

``

she
went
out
to
open

door

Maggie
eagerly
*NL*
following
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That

fortunate

said
Mrs.

.
``
She
can
agree

it

*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Moss
was
in
too
much
agitation
to
resist
Mrs.
Tulliver
's
*NL*
movement
,
as
she
drew
her
into
the
parlor
automatically
,
without
*NL*
reflecting
that
it
was
hardly
kind
to
take
her
among
so
many
persons
*NL*
in
the
first
painful
moment
of
arrival
.
The
tall
,
worn
,
dark-haired
*NL*
woman
was
a
strong
contrast
to
the
Dodson
sisters
as
she
entered
in
*NL*
her
shabby
dress
,
with
her
shawl
and
bonnet
looking
as
if
they
had
*NL*
been
hastily
huddled
on
,
and
with
that
entire
absence
of
*NL*
self-consciousness
which
belongs
to
keenly
felt
trouble
.
Maggie
was
*NL*
clinging
to
her
arm
;
and
Mrs.
Moss
seemed
to
notice
no
one
else
except
*NL*
Tom
,
whom
she
went
straight
up
to
and
took
by
the
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

she
burst
out
,
``

*NL*

Mrs.

allowing

Maggie
to
lead
her
to
the
sofa

but
still
not
seeming
to
notice
the

presence
of
the

The
poor

was
interrupted
by
a
rising
sob

*NL*
*NL*
``
Three

Mrs.

when

said
that

done
``

in

*NL*
``

Mrs.

looking
up

she
said

said
Mrs.

looking
at
Mrs.

nothing

the

I

speaking

my

she
added
,
looking
at

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
there
's
this
to
be
thought
on
,
Mrs.
Moss
,
''
said
Mr.
Glegg
,
``

*NL*
it
's
right
to
warn

got
a

note-of-hand

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

oh

said
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
thinking
of
the
bankruptcy
,
*NL*
and
not
of
Mrs.
Moss
's
concern
in
it

Poor
Mrs.
Moss
herself
listened
*NL*
in
trembling
submission
,
while
Maggie
looked
with
bewildered
distress
*NL*
at
Tom
to
see
if
_
he
_
showed
any
signs
of
understanding
this
trouble
,
*NL*
and
caring
about
poor
aunt
Moss
.
Tom
was
only
looking
thoughtful
,
with
*NL*
his
eyes
on
the
tablecloth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
if
he
is
n't
made
bankrupt

continued
Mr.
Glegg
,
``
as
I
said

before

I

very
sorry

my

opinion
is
,
looking
at

one
way

it
'll
be
right
for

to
raise
the

looking
up
suddenly

*NL*
*NL*
Mr.

looked
surprised
for
a
moment
or
two
before
he
said
:

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

said
Tom
,
coloring
,
but
trying
to
speak
firmly
,
in
spite
of
a
*NL*
boyish
tremor
,
``
I
remember
quite
well
,
before
I
went
to
school
to
Mr.

Stelling

my

one
night

when
we
were
sitting
by

fire
together

no

*NL*
*NL*
Tom
hesitated
a
little
,

then
went
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
said
something
to
me

good
to
my

she
married

lent
Moss
money

I
shall
never

of
distressing
him
to
pay
it

I
'd
rather
lose
it

My

must
not

being
the

now
my

ill

not

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

then

my

said
Uncle
Glegg

whose
good
feeling
led
him
*NL*
to
enter
into
Tom
's
wish

but
who
could
not
at
once
shake
off
his
*NL*
habitual
abhorrence
of
such
recklessness
as
destroying
securities
,
or
*NL*
alienating
anything
important
enough
to
make
an
appreciable
difference
*NL*
in
a
man

*NL*
``
That

a

had

with

in

to
express
his

amazement

*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.

had
not
studied
the
question
of

was
*NL*
straining
her
mind
after
original
ideas
on
the
subject

*NL*
*NL*
``
Pooh

*NL*
``
Then
I

earnestly
.
``
If

I

been
done
against

will
that
I
could
hinder

And
I
'm
sure
he

meant
me
to
remember
what
he
said
that
evening

I
ought

obey
my

''
*NL*
*NL*
Even
Mrs.
Glegg
could
not
withhold
her
approval
from
Tom
's
words
;
she
*NL*
felt
that
the
Dodson
blood
was
certainly
speaking
in
him
,
though
,
if
*NL*
his
father
had
been
a
Dodson
,
there
would
never
have
been
this
wicked
*NL*
alienation
of
money

Maggie
would
hardly
have
restrained
herself
from
*NL*
leaping
on
Tom
's
neck
,
if
her
aunt
Moss
had
not
prevented
her
by
*NL*
herself
rising
and
taking
Tom
's
hand
,
while
she
said
,
with
rather
a
*NL*
choked
voice
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

said
Mr.

who
had
been
meditating
after
Tom

words
,
``
we

should
n't
be
doing

that

myself

seen
no

cheating

If
he
meant
to
give
your

the
*NL*
money
before
ever
he
got
into

sad
work

it
's
the
same
*NL*
as
if
he

made
away
with
the
note
himself

he
'd
made
up
his
mind

to
be

much
poorer

there
's
a
deal
o

things
to
be
considered

Mr.
Glegg
added
,
looking
admonishingly
at
Tom
,
``
when
you

Yes

decidedly

I

no

up
his

it

*NL*
``
Well

I

Glegg
,
with
much
candor

Chapter

*NL*
*NL*
A
Vanishing
Gleam
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Tulliver
,
even
between
the
fits
of
spasmodic
rigidity
which
had
*NL*
recurred
at
intervals
ever
since
he
had
been
found
fallen
from
his
*NL*
horse
,
was
usually
in
so
apathetic
a
condition
that
the
exits
and
*NL*
entrances
into
his
room
were
not
felt
to
be
of
great
importance
.
He
*NL*
had
lain
so
still
,
with
his
eyes
closed
,
all
this
morning
,
that
Maggie
*NL*
told
her
aunt
Moss
she
must
not
expect
her
father
to
take
any
notice
*NL*
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
entered
very
quietly
,
and
Mrs.
Moss
took
her
seat
near
the
head
*NL*
of
the
bed
,
while
Maggie
sat
in
her
old
place
on
the
bed
,
and
put
her
*NL*
hand
on
her
father
's
without
causing
any
change
in
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Glegg
and
Tom
had
also
entered
,
treading
softly
,
and
were
busy
*NL*
selecting
the
key
of
the
old
oak
chest
from
the
bunch
which
Tom
had
*NL*
brought
from
his
father
's
bureau
.
They
succeeded
in
opening
the
*NL*
chest
,
--
which
stood
opposite
the
foot
of
Mr.
Tulliver
's
bed
,
--
and
*NL*
propping
the
lid
with
the
iron
holder
,
without
much
noise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
a
tin
box
,
''
whispered
Mr.
Glegg
;
``
he
'd
most
like
put
a
small
*NL*
thing
like
a
note
in
there
.
Lift
it
out
,
Tom
;
but
I
'll
just
lift
up
*NL*
these
deeds
,
--
they
're
the
deeds
o
'
the
house
and
mill
,
I
suppose
,
--
and
*NL*
see
what
there
is
under
'em
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Glegg
had
lifted
out
the
parchments
,
and
had
fortunately
drawn
*NL*
back
a
little
,
when
the
iron
holder
gave
way
,
and
the
heavy
lid
fell
*NL*
with
a
loud
bang
that
resounded
over
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
Perhaps
there
was
something
in
that
sound
more
than
the
mere
fact
of
*NL*
the
strong
vibration
that
produced
the
instantaneous
effect
on
the
*NL*
frame
of
the
prostrate
man
,
and
for
the
time
completely
shook
off
the
*NL*
obstruction
of
paralysis
.
The
chest
had
belonged
to
his
father
and
his
*NL*
father
's
father
,
and
it
had
always
been
rather
a
solemn
business
to
*NL*
visit
it
.
All
long-known
objects
,
even
a
mere
window
fastening
or
a
*NL*
particular
door-latch
,
have
sounds
which
are
a
sort
of
recognized
*NL*
voice
to
us
,
--
a
voice
that
will
thrill
and
awaken
,
when
it
has
been
*NL*
used
to
touch
deep-lying
fibres
.
In
the
same
moment
,
when
all
the
eyes
*NL*
in
the
room
were
turned
upon
him
,
he
started
up
and
looked
at
the
*NL*
chest
,
the
parchments
in
Mr.
Glegg
's
hand
,
and
Tom
holding
the
tin
*NL*
box
,
with
a
glance
of
perfect
consciousness
and
recognition
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
going
to
do
with
those
deeds
?
''
he
said
,
in
his
ordinary
*NL*
tone
of
sharp
questioning
whenever
he
was
irritated
.
``
Come
here
,
Tom
.
*NL*
What
do
you
do
,
going
to
my
chest
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
obeyed
,
with
some
trembling
;
it
was
the
first
time
his
father
had
*NL*
recognized
him
.
But
instead
of
saying
anything
more
to
him
,
his
father
*NL*
continued
to
look
with
a
growing
distinctness
of
suspicion
at
Mr.
*NL*
Glegg
and
the
deeds
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
been
happening
,
then
?
''
he
said
sharply
.
``
What
are
you
meddling
*NL*
with
my
deeds
for
?
Is
Wakem
laying
hold
of
everything
?
Why
do
n't
you
*NL*
tell
me
what
you
've
been
a-doing
?
''
he
added
impatiently
,
as
Mr.
Glegg
*NL*
advanced
to
the
foot
of
the
bed
before
speaking
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
friend
Tulliver
,
''
said
Mr.
Glegg
,
in
a
soothing
tone
.
*NL*
``
Nobody
's
getting
hold
of
anything
as
yet
.
We
only
came
to
look
and
*NL*
see
what
was
in
the
chest
.
You
've
been
ill
,
you
know
,
and
we
've
had
to
*NL*
look
after
things
a
bit
.
But
let
's
hope
you
'll
soon
be
well
enough
to
*NL*
attend
to
everything
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Tulliver
looked
around
him
meditatively
,
at
Tom
,
at
Mr.
Glegg
,
and
*NL*
at
Maggie
;
then
suddenly
appearing
aware
that
some
one
was
seated
by
*NL*
his
side
at
the
head
of
the
bed
he
turned
sharply
round
and
saw
his
*NL*
sister
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
,
Gritty
!
''
he
said
,
in
the
half-sad
,
affectionate
tone
in
which
he
*NL*
had
been
wont
to
speak
to
her
.
``
What
!
you
're
there
,
are
you
?
How
could
*NL*
you
manage
to
leave
the
children
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
brother
!
''
said
good
Mrs.
Moss
,
too
impulsive
to
be
prudent
,
``
I
'm
*NL*
thankful
I
'm
come
now
to
see
you
yourself
again
;
I
thought
you
'd
never
*NL*
know
us
any
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
have
I
had
a
stroke
?
''
said
Mr.
Tulliver
,
anxiously
,
looking
at
*NL*
Mr.
Glegg
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
fall
from
your
horse
--
shook
you
a
bit
,
--
that
's
all
,
I
think
,
''
said
*NL*
Mr.
Glegg
.
``
But
you
'll
soon
get
over
it
,
let
's
hope
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Tulliver
fixed
his
eyes
on
the
bed-clothes
,
and
remained
silent
*NL*
for
two
or
three
minutes
.
A
new
shadow
came
over
his
face
.
He
looked
*NL*
up
at
Maggie
first
,
and
said
in
a
lower
tone
,
``
You
got
the
letter
,
*NL*
then
,
my
wench
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
father
,
''
she
said
,
kissing
him
with
a
full
heart
.
She
felt
as
if
*NL*
her
father
were
come
back
to
her
from
the
dead
,
and
her
yearning
to
*NL*
show
him
how
she
had
always
loved
him
could
be
fulfilled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
's
your
mother
?
''
he
said
,
so
preoccupied
that
he
received
the
*NL*
kiss
as
passively
as
some
quiet
animal
might
have
received
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
downstairs
with
my
aunts
,
father
.
Shall
I
fetch
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
ay
;
poor
Bessy
!
''
and
his
eyes
turned
toward
Tom
as
Maggie
left
*NL*
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
have
to
take
care
of
'em
both
if
I
die
,
you
know
,
Tom
.
You
'll
*NL*
be
badly
off
,
I
doubt
.
But
you
must
see
and
pay
everybody
.
And
*NL*
mind
,
--
there
's
fifty
pound
o
'
Luke
's
as
I
put
into
the
business
,
--
he
*NL*
gave
me
a
bit
at
a
time
,
and
he
's
got
nothing
to
show
for
it
.
You
must
*NL*
pay
him
first
thing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Uncle
Glegg
involuntarily
shook
his
head
,
and
looked
more
concerned
*NL*
than
ever
,
but
Tom
said
firmly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
father
.
And
have
n't
you
a
note
from
my
uncle
Moss
for
three
*NL*
hundred
pounds
?
We
came
to
look
for
that
.
What
do
you
wish
to
be
done
*NL*
about
it
,
father
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
I
'm
glad
you
thought
o
'
that
,
my
lad
,
''
said
Mr.
Tulliver
.
``
I
*NL*
allays
meant
to
be
easy
about
that
money
,
because
o
'
your
aunt
.
You
*NL*
must
n't
mind
losing
the
money
,
if
they
ca
n't
pay
it
,
--
and
it
's
like
*NL*
enough
they
ca
n't
.
The
note
's
in
that
box
,
mind
!
I
allays
meant
to
be
*NL*
good
to
you
,
Gritty

''
said
Mr.
Tulliver
,
turning
to
his
sister
;
``
but
*NL*
you
know
you
aggravated
me
when
you
would
have
Moss
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
moment
Maggie
re-entered
with
her
mother
,
who
came
in
much
*NL*
agitated
by
the
news
that
her
husband
was
quite
himself
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Bessy
,
''
he
said
,
as
she
kissed
him
,
``
you
must
forgive
me
if
*NL*
you
're
worse
off
than
you
ever
expected
to
be
.
But
it
's
the
fault
o
'
*NL*
the
law
,
--
it
's
none
o
'
mine
,
''
he
added
angrily
.
``
It
's
the
fault
o
'
*NL*
raskills
.
Tom
,
you
mind
this
:
if
ever
you
've
got
the
chance
,
you
make
*NL*
Wakem
smart
.
If
you
do
n't
,
you
're
a
good-for-nothing
son
.
You
might
*NL*
horse-whip
him
,
but
he
'd
set
the
law
on
you
,
--
the
law
's
made
to
take
*NL*
care
o
'
raskills
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Tulliver
was
getting
excited
,
and
an
alarming
flush
was
on
his
*NL*
face
.
Mr.
Glegg
wanted
to
say
something
soothing
,
but
he
was
prevented
*NL*
by
Mr.
Tulliver
's
speaking
again
to
his
wife
.
``
They
'll
make
a
shift
to
*NL*
pay
everything
,
Bessy
,
''
he
said
,
``
and
yet
leave
you
your
furniture
;
*NL*
and
your
sisters
'll
do
something
for
you
--
and
Tom
'll
grow
up
--
though
*NL*
what
he
's
to
be
I
do
n't
know
--
I
've
done
what
I
could
--
I
've
given
him
a
*NL*
eddication
--
and
there
's
the
little
wench
,
she
'll
get
married
--
but
it
's
*NL*
a
poor
tale
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
sanative
effect
of
the
strong
vibration
was
exhausted
,
and
with
*NL*
the
last
words
the
poor
man
fell
again
,
rigid
and
insensible
.
Though
*NL*
this
was
only
a
recurrence
of
what
had
happened
before
,
it
struck
all
*NL*
present
as
if
it
had
been
death
,
not
only
from
its
contrast
with
the
*NL*
completeness
of
the
revival
,
but
because
his
words
had
all
had
*NL*
reference
to
the
possibility
that
his
death
was
near
.
But
with
poor
*NL*
Tulliver
death
was
not
to
be
a
leap
;
it
was
to
be
a
long
descent
under
*NL*
thickening
shadows
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Turnbull
was
sent
for
;
but
when
he
heard
what
had
passed
,
he
said
*NL*
this
complete
restoration
,
though
only
temporary
,
was
a
hopeful
sign
,
*NL*
proving
that
there
was
no
permanent
lesion
to
prevent
ultimate
*NL*
recovery
.
*NL*
*NL*
Among
the
threads
of
the
past
which
the
stricken
man
had
gathered
up
,
*NL*
he
had
omitted
the
bill
of
sale
;
the
flash
of
memory
had
only
lit
up
*NL*
prominent
ideas
,
and
he
sank
into
forgetfulness
again
with
half
his
*NL*
humiliation
unlearned
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Tom
was
clear
upon
two
points
,
--
that
his
uncle
Moss
's
note
must
be
*NL*
destroyed
;
and
that
Luke
's
money
must
be
paid
,
if
in
no
other
way
,
out
*NL*
of
his
own
and
Maggie
's
money
now
in
the
savings
bank
.
There
were
*NL*
subjects
,
you
perceive
,
on
which
Tom
was
much
quicker
than
on
the
*NL*
niceties
of
classical
construction
,
or
the
relations
of
a
mathematical
*NL*
demonstration
.

Tom
Applies
His
Knife
to
the
Oyster
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
,
at
ten
o'clock
,
Tom
was
on
his
way
to
St.
Ogg
's
,
to
see
*NL*
his
uncle
Deane
,
who
was
to
come
home
last
night
,
his
aunt
had
said
;
*NL*
and
Tom
had
made
up
his
mind
that
his
uncle
Deane
was
the
right
person
*NL*
to
ask
for
advice
about
getting
some
employment
.
He
was
in
a
great
way
*NL*
of
business
;
he
had
not
the
narrow
notions
of
uncle
Glegg
;
and
he
had
*NL*
risen
in
the
world
on
a
scale
of
advancement
which
accorded
with
Tom
's
*NL*
ambition
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
dark
,
chill
,
misty
morning
,
likely
to
end
in
rain
,
--
one
of
*NL*
those
mornings
when
even
happy
people
take
refuge
in
their
hopes
.
And
*NL*
Tom
was
very
unhappy
;
he
felt
the
humiliation
as
well
as
the
*NL*
prospective
hardships
of
his
lot
with
all
the
keenness
of
a
proud
*NL*
nature
;
and
with
all
his
resolute
dutifulness
toward
his
father
there
*NL*
mingled
an
irrepressible
indignation
against
him
which
gave
misfortune
*NL*
the
less
endurable
aspect
of
a
wrong
.
Since
these
were
the
*NL*
consequences
of
going
to
law
,
his
father
was
really
blamable
,
as
his
*NL*
aunts
and
uncles
had
always
said
he
was
;
and
it
was
a
significant
*NL*
indication
of
Tom
's
character
,
that
though
he
thought
his
aunts
ought
*NL*
to
do
something
more
for
his
mother
,
he
felt
nothing
like
Maggie
's
*NL*
violent
resentment
against
them
for
showing
no
eager
tenderness
and
*NL*
generosity
.
There
were
no
impulses
in
Tom
that
led
him
to
expect
what
*NL*
did
not
present
itself
to
him
as
a
right
to
be
demanded
.
Why
should
*NL*
people
give
away
their
money
plentifully
to
those
who
had
not
taken
*NL*
care
of
their
own
money
?
Tom
saw
some
justice
in
severity
;
and
all
the
*NL*
more
,
because
he
had
confidence
in
himself
that
he
should
never
*NL*
deserve
that
just
severity
.
It
was
very
hard
upon
him
that
he
should
*NL*
be
put
at
this
disadvantage
in
life
by
his
father
's
want
of
prudence
;
*NL*
but
he
was
not
going
to
complain
and
to
find
fault
with
people
because
*NL*
they
did
not
make
everything
easy
for
him
.
He
would
ask
no
one
to
help
*NL*
him
,
more
than
to
give
him
work
and
pay
him
for
it
.
Poor
Tom
was
not
*NL*
without
his
hopes
to
take
refuge
in
under
the
chill
damp
imprisonment
*NL*
of
the
December
fog
,
which
seemed
only
like
a
part
of
his
home
*NL*
troubles
.
At
sixteen
,
the
mind
that
has
the
strongest
affinity
for
*NL*
fact
can
not
escape
illusion
and
self-flattery
;
and
Tom
,
in
sketching
*NL*
his
future
,
had
no
other
guide
in
arranging
his
facts
than
the
*NL*
suggestions
of
his
own
brave
self-reliance
.
Both
Mr.
Glegg
and
Mr.
*NL*
Deane
,
he
knew
,
had
been
very
poor
once
;
he
did
not
want
to
save
money
*NL*
slowly
and
retire
on
a
moderate
fortune
like
his
uncle
Glegg
,
but
he
*NL*
would
be
like
his
uncle
Deane
--
get
a
situation
in
some
great
house
of
*NL*
business
and
rise
fast
.
He
had
scarcely
seen
anything
of
his
uncle
*NL*
Deane
for
the
last
three
years
--
the
two
families
had
been
getting
*NL*
wider
apart
;
but
for
this
very
reason
Tom
was
the
more
hopeful
about
*NL*
applying
to
him
.
His
uncle
Glegg
,
he
felt
sure
,
would
never
encourage
*NL*
any
spirited
project
,
but
he
had
a
vague
imposing
idea
of
the
*NL*
resources
at
his
uncle
Deane
's
command
.
He
had
heard
his
father
say
,
*NL*
long
ago
,
how
Deane
had
made
himself
so
valuable
to
Guest
&
Co.
that
*NL*
they
were
glad
enough
to
offer
him
a
share
in
the
business
;
that
was
*NL*
what
Tom
resolved
_
he
_
would
do
.
It
was
intolerable
to
think
of
being
*NL*
poor
and
looked
down
upon
all
one
's
life
.
He
would
provide
for
his
*NL*
mother
and
sister
,
and
make
every
one
say
that
he
was
a
man
of
high
*NL*
character
.
He
leaped
over
the
years
in
this
way
,
and
,
in
the
haste
of
*NL*
strong
purpose
and
strong
desire
,
did
not
see
how
they
would
be
made
*NL*
up
of
slow
days
,
hours
,
and
minutes
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
the
time
he
had
crossed
the
stone
bridge
over
the
Floss
and
was
*NL*
entering
St.
Ogg
's
,
he
was
thinking
that
he
would
buy
his
father
's
*NL*
mill
and
land
again
when
he
was
rich
enough
,
and
improve
the
house
and
*NL*
live
there
;
he
should
prefer
it
to
any
smarter
,
newer
place
,
and
he
*NL*
could
keep
as
many
horses
and
dogs
as
he
liked
.
*NL*
*NL*
Walking
along
the
street
with
a
firm
,
rapid
step
,
at
this
point
in
his
*NL*
reverie
he
was
startled
by
some
one
who
had
crossed
without
his
*NL*
notice
,
and
who
said
to
him
in
a
rough
,
familiar
voice
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
Master
Tom
,
how
's
your
father
this
morning
?
''
It
was
a
publican
*NL*
of
St.
Ogg
's
,
one
of
his
father
's
customers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
disliked
being
spoken
to
just
then
;
but
he
said
civilly
,
``
He
's
*NL*
still
very
ill
,
thank
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
it
's
been
a
sore
chance
for
you
,
young
man
,
has
n't
it
,
--
this
*NL*
lawsuit
turning
out
against
him
?
''
said
the
publican
,
with
a
confused
,
*NL*
beery
idea
of
being
good-natured
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
reddened
and
passed
on
;
he
would
have
felt
it
like
the
handling
of
*NL*
a
bruise
,
even
if
there
had
been
the
most
polite
and
delicate
*NL*
reference
to
his
position
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
Tulliver
's
son
,
''
said
the
publican
to
a
grocer
standing
on
the
*NL*
adjacent
door-step
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
said
the
grocer
,
``
I
thought
I
knew
his
features
.
He
takes
after
*NL*
his
mother
's
family
;
she
was
a
Dodson
.
He
's
a
fine
,
straight
youth
;
*NL*
what
's
he
been
brought
up
to
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
to
turn
up
his
nose
at
his
father
's
customers
,
and
be
a
fine
*NL*
gentleman
,
--
not
much
else
,
I
think
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
,
roused
from
his
dream
of
the
future
to
a
thorough
consciousness
*NL*
of
the
present
,
made
all
the
greater
haste
to
reach
the
warehouse
*NL*
offices
of
Guest
&
Co.
,
where
he
expected
to
find
his
uncle
Deane
.
But
*NL*
this
was
Mr.
Deane
's
morning
at
the
band
,
a
clerk
told
him
,
and
with
*NL*
some
contempt
for
his
ignorance
;
Mr.
Deane
was
not
to
be
found
in
*NL*
River
Street
on
a
Thursday
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
bank
Tom
was
admitted
into
the
private
room
where
his
uncle
*NL*
was
,
immediately
after
sending
in
his
name
.
Mr.
Deane
was
auditing
*NL*
accounts
;
but
he
looked
up
as
Tom
entered
,
and
putting
out
his
hand
,
*NL*
said
,
``
Well
,
Tom
,
nothing
fresh
the
matter
at
home
,
I
hope
?
How
's
your
*NL*
father
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Much
the
same
,
thank
you
,
uncle
,
''
said
Tom
,
feeling
nervous
.
``
But
I
*NL*
want
to
speak
to
you
,
please
,
when
you
're
at
liberty

*NL*
``
Sit
down

sit
down

''
said
Mr.
Deane
,
relapsing
into
his
accounts
,
in
*NL*
which
he
and
the
managing-clerk
remained
so
absorbed
for
the
next
*NL*
half-hour
that
Tom
began
to
wonder
whether
he
should
have
to
sit
in
*NL*
this
way
till
the
bank
closed
,
--
there
seemed
so
little
tendency
toward
*NL*
a
conclusion
in
the
quiet
,
monotonous
procedure
of
these
sleek
,
*NL*
prosperous
men
of
business
.
Would
his
uncle
give
him
a
place
in
the
*NL*
bank
?
It
would
be
very
dull
,
prosy
work
,
he
thought
,
writing
there
*NL*
forever
to
the
loud
ticking
of
a
timepiece
.
He
preferred
some
other
*NL*
way
of
getting
rich
.
But
at
last
there
was
a
change
;
his
uncle
took
a
*NL*
pen
and
wrote
something
with
a
flourish
at
the
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
just
step
up
to
Torry
's
now
,
Mr.
Spence
,
will
you
?
''
said
Mr.
*NL*
Deane
,
and
the
clock
suddenly
became
less
loud
and
deliberate
in
Tom
's
*NL*
ears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Tom
,
''
said
Mr.
Deane
,
when
they
were
alone
,
turning
his
*NL*
substantial
person
a
little
in
his
chair
,
and
taking
out
his
*NL*
snuff-box
;
``
what
's
the
business
,
my
boy
;
what
's
the
business
?
''
Mr.
*NL*
Deane
,
who
had
heard
from
his
wife
what
had
passed
the
day
before
,
*NL*
thought
Tom
was
come
to
appeal
to
him
for
some
means
of
averting
the
*NL*
sale
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
you
'll
excuse
me
for
troubling
you
,
uncle
,
''
said
Tom
,
*NL*
coloring
,
but
speaking
in
a
tone
which
,
though
,
tremulous
,
had
a
*NL*
certain
proud
independence
in
it
;
``
but
I
thought
you
were
the
best
*NL*
person
to
advise
me
what
to
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
said
Mr.
Deane
,
reserving
his
pinch
of
snuff
,
and
looking
at
Tom
*NL*
with
new
attention
,
``
let
us
hear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
to
get
a
situation
,
uncle
,
so
that
I
may
earn
some
money
,
''
*NL*
said
Tom
,
who
never
fell
into
circumlocution
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
situation
?
''
said
Mr.
Deane
,
and
then
took
his
pinch
of
snuff
with
*NL*
elaborate
justice
to
each
nostril
.
Tom
thought
snuff-taking
a
most
*NL*
provoking
habit
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
let
me
see
,
how
old
are
you
?
''
said
Mr.
Deane
,
as
he
threw
*NL*
himself
backward
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sixteen
;
I
mean
,
I
am
going
in
seventeen
,
''
said
Tom
,
hoping
his
uncle
*NL*
noticed
how
much
beard
he
had
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
see
;
your
father
had
some
notion
of
making
you
an
engineer
,
I
*NL*
think
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
do
n't
think
I
could
get
any
money
at
that
for
a
long
while
,
*NL*
could
I
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
true
;
but
people
do
n't
get
much
money
at
anything

my
boy

they
're
only
sixteen

You
've
had
a
good

of
schooling

however
;
I
suppose
you
're
pretty
well
up
in
accounts
,
eh
?
You
*NL*
understand
book
keeping
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

''
said
Tom
,
rather
falteringly
.
``
I
was
in
Practice
.
But
Mr.
*NL*
Stelling
says
I
write
a
good
hand

That
's
my
writing

''
added
*NL*
Tom
,
laying
on
the
table
a
copy
of
the
list
he
had
made
yesterday
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

that
's
good

that
's
good

But

you

the
best

world
'll
not
get
you
a
better
place
than
a
copying-clerk
's
,
if
you
*NL*
know
nothing
of
book-keeping
,
--
nothing
of
accounts
.
And
a
*NL*
copying-clerk
's
a
cheap
article
.
But
what
have
you
been
learning
at
*NL*
school
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Deane
had
not
occupied
himself
with
methods
of
education
,
and
had
*NL*
no
precise
conception
of
what
went
forward
in
expensive
schools
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
learned
Latin
,
''
said
Tom
,
pausing
a
little
between
each
item
,
as
*NL*
if
he
were
turning
over
the
books
in
his
school-desk
to
assist
his
*NL*
memory
,
--
``
a
good
deal
of
Latin
;
and
the
last
year
I
did
Themes
,
one
*NL*
week
in
Latin
and
one
in
English
;
and
Greek
and
Roman
history
;
and
*NL*
Euclid
;
and
I
began
Algebra
,
but
I
left
it
off
again
;
and
we
had
one
*NL*
day
every
week
for
Arithmetic
.
Then
I
used
to
have
drawing-lessons
;
*NL*
and
there
were
several
other
books
we
either
read
or
learned
out
*NL*
of
,
--
English
Poetry
,
and
Horae
Paulinae
and
Blair
's
Rhetoric
,
the
last
*NL*
half
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Deane
tapped
his
snuff-box
again
and
screwed
up
his
mouth
;
he
felt
*NL*
in
the
position
of
many
estimable
persons
when
they
had
read
the
New
*NL*
Tariff
,
and
found
how
many
commodities
were
imported
of
which
they
*NL*
knew
nothing
;
like
a
cautious
man
of
business
,
he
was
not
going
to
*NL*
speak
rashly
of
a
raw
material
in
which
he
had
had
no
experience
.
But
*NL*
the
presumption
was
,
that
if
it
had
been
good
for
anything
,
so
*NL*
successful
a
man
as
himself
would
hardly
have
been
ignorant
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
Latin
he
had
an
opinion
,
and
thought
that
in
case
of
another
*NL*
war
,
since
people
would
no
longer
wear
hair-powder
,
it
would
be
well
*NL*
to
put
a
tax
upon
Latin
,
as
a
luxury
much
run
upon
by
the
higher
*NL*
classes
,
and
not
telling
at
all
on
the
ship-owning
department
.
But
,
*NL*
for
what
he
knew
,
the
Horae
Paulinae
might
be
something
less
neutral
.
On
*NL*
the
whole
,
this
list
of
acquirements
gave
him
a
sort
of
repulsion
*NL*
toward
poor
Tom
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
he
said
at
last
,
in
rather
a
cold
,
sardonic
tone
,
``
you
've
had
*NL*
three
years
at
these
things
,
--
you
must
be
pretty
strong
in
'em
.
Had
n't
*NL*
you
better
take
up
some
line
where
they
'll
come
in
handy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
colored
,
and
burst
out
,
with
new
energy
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'd
rather
not
have
any
employment
of
that
sort
,
uncle
.
I
do
n't
like
*NL*
Latin

those
things
.
I
do
n't
know
what
I
could
do
with
them
unless
*NL*
I
went
as
usher
in
a
school
;
and
I
do
n't
know
them
well
enough
for
*NL*
that
!
besides
,
I
would
as
soon
carry
a
pair
of
panniers
.
I
do
n't
want
*NL*
to
be
that
sort
of
person

I
should
like
to
enter
into
some
business
*NL*
where
I
can
get
on
,

a
manly
business
,
where
I
should
have
to
look
*NL*
after
things
,
and
get
credit
for
what
I
did

And
I
shall
want
to
keep
*NL*
my
mother

sister

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
young
gentleman

''
said
Mr.
Deane
,
with
that
tendency
to
repress
*NL*
youthful
hopes
which
stout
and
successful
men
of
fifty
find
one
of
*NL*
their
easiest
duties
,
``
that
's
sooner
said

done

sooner
said
than
*NL*
done

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
did
n't
_
you
_
get
on
in
that
way
,
uncle
?
''
said
Tom
,
a
little
*NL*
irritated
that
Mr.
Deane
did
not
enter
more
rapidly
into
his
views
.
``
I
*NL*
mean
,
did
n't
you
rise
from
one
place
to
another
through
your
abilities
*NL*
and
good
conduct
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
ay
,
sir
,
''
said
Mr.
Deane
,
spreading
himself
in
his
chair
a
*NL*
little
,
and
entering
with
great
readiness
into
a
retrospect
of
his
own
*NL*
career
.
``
But
I
'll
tell
you
how
I
got
on
.
It
was
n't
by
getting
astride
*NL*
a
stick
and
thinking
it
would
turn
into
a
horse
if
I
sat
on
it
long
*NL*
enough
.
I
kept
my
eyes
and
ears
open
,
sir
,
and
I
was
n't
too
fond
of
my
*NL*
own
back
,
and
I
made
my
master
's
interest
my
own
.
Why
,
with
only
*NL*
looking
into
what
went
on
in
the
mill
,
I
found
out
how
there
was
a
*NL*
waste
of
five
hundred
a-year
that
might
be
hindered
.
Why
,
sir
,
I
*NL*
had
n't
more
schooling
to
begin
with
than
a
charity
boy
;
but
I
saw
*NL*
pretty
soon
that
I
could
n't
get
on
far
enough
without
mastering
*NL*
accounts
,
and
I
learned
'em
between
working
hours
,
after
I
'd
been
*NL*
unlading
.
Look
here
.
''
Mr.
Deane
opened
a
book
and
pointed
to
the
page
.
*NL*
``
I
write
a
good
hand
enough
,
and
I
'll
match
anybody
at
all
sorts
of
*NL*
reckoning
by
the
head
;
and
I
got
it
all
by
hard
work
,
and
paid
for
it
*NL*
out
of
my
own
earnings
,
--
often
out
of
my
own
dinner
and
supper
.
And
I
*NL*
looked
into
the
nature
of
all
the
things
we
had
to
do
in
the
business
,
*NL*
and
picked
up
knowledge
as
I
went
about
my
work
,
and
turned
it
over
in
*NL*
my
head
.
Why
,
I
'm
no
mechanic
,
--
I
never
pretended
to
be
--
but
I
've
*NL*
thought
of
a
thing
or
two
that
the
mechanics
never
thought
of
,

*NL*
it
's
made
a
fine
difference

there
is

an
article

shipped

unshipped
at

I
know
the
quality
of
it

If
I
*NL*
got
places
,
sir

it
was
because
I
made
myself
fit
for
'em
.
If
you
want
*NL*
to
slip
into

you
must
make
a
ball
of
yourself

Mr.
Deane
tapped
his
box
again
.
He
had
been
led
on
by
pure
enthusiasm
*NL*
in
his
subject
,
and
had
really
forgotten
what
bearing
this
*NL*
retrospective
survey
had
on
his
listener
.
He
had
found
occasion
for
*NL*
saying
the
same
thing
more
than
once
before
,
and
was
not
distinctly
*NL*
aware
that
he
had
not
his
port-wine
before
him

*NL*
``
Well

Tom

with
a
slight
complaint
in
his
tone

``

what

In

Mr.

eyeing
Tom
with
quiet
deliberation

*NL*
``
There
go
two

three

what

whether
you
've
been

put
into

But
I
'll
tell
you
what
it
is

Your

went
the

nothing

earnestly

from
getting

I
shall
soon
forget
it
all

it
*NL*
makes
no

I
had
to
do
my
lessons
at
school

I
*NL*
always
thought
they

never

dry
off

you

you
'll
be

it

your

taken

round

bit
his
lips
hard

felt
as

tears
were

*NL*
know
,
I
know
,
--
you
want
to
make
more
haste
,
and
you
do
n't
want
to
*NL*
stand
behind
a
counter
.
But
if
you
're
a
copying-clerk
,
you
'll
have
to
*NL*
stand
behind
a
desk
,
and
stare
at
your
ink
and
paper
all
day
;
there
*NL*
is
n't
much
out-look
there
,
and
you
wo
n't
be
much
wiser
at
the
end
of
*NL*
the
year
than
at
the
beginning
.
The
world
is
n't
made
of
pen
,
ink
,
and
*NL*
paper
,
and
if
you
're
to
get
on
in
the
world
,
young
man
,
you
must
know
*NL*
what
the
world
's
made
of
.
Now
the
best
chance
for
you
`
ud
be
to
have
a
*NL*
place
on
a
wharf
,
or
in
a
warehouse
,
where
you
'd
learn
the
smell
of
*NL*
things
,
but
you
would
n't
like
that
,
I
'll
be
bound
;
you
'd
have
to
stand
*NL*
cold
and
wet
,
and
be
shouldered
about
by
rough
fellows
.
You
're
too
*NL*
fine
a
gentleman
for
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Deane
paused
and
looked
hard
at
Tom
,
who
certainly
felt
some
*NL*
inward
struggle
before
he
could
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
rather
do
what
will
be
best
for
me
in
the
end
,
sir
;
I
would
*NL*
put
up
with
what
was
disagreeable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
well
,
if
you
can
carry
it
out
.
But
you
must
remember
it
is
n't
*NL*
only
laying
hold
of
a
rope
,
you
must
go
on
pulling
.
It
's
the
mistake
*NL*
you
lads
make
that
have
got
nothing
either
in
your
brains
or
your
*NL*
pocket
,
to
think
you
've
got
a
better
start
in
the
world
if
you
stick
*NL*
yourselves
in
a
place
where
you
can
keep
your
coats
clean
,
and
have
*NL*
the
shopwenches
take
you
for
fine
gentlemen
.
That
was
n't
the
way
_
I
_
*NL*
started
,
young
man
;
when
I
was
sixteen
,
my
jacket
smelt
of
tar
,
and
I
*NL*
was
n't
afraid
of
handling
cheeses
.
That
's
the
reason
I
can
wear
good
*NL*
broadcloth
now
,
and
have
my
legs
under
the
same
table
with
the
head
*NL*
of
the
best
firms
in
St.
Ogg
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Uncle
Deane
tapped
his
box
,
and
seemed
to
expand
a
little
under
his
*NL*
waistcoat
and
gold
chain
,
as
he
squared
his
shoulders
in
the
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
there
any
place
at
liberty
that
you
know
of
now
,

,
that
I
*NL*
should
do
for
?
I
should
like
to
set
to
work

said
Tom
,
with
a
*NL*
slight
tremor
in
his
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stop
a
bit

stop
a
bit

we

be
in

great
a

bear
in

put

you
happen
to
be
my

I
shall
be
responsible
for
you
.
And
*NL*
there
's
no
better
reason
,
you
know

than
your
being
my
nephew

because
*NL*
it
remains
to
be
seen
whether
you
're
good
for
anything

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
I
shall
never
do
you
any
discredit
,
uncle

''
said
Tom
,
hurt
,
as
*NL*
all
boys
are
at
the
statement
of
the
unpleasant
truth
that
people
feel
*NL*
no
ground
for
trusting
them
.
``
I
care
about
my
own
credit
too
much
for
*NL*
that

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
done

Tom
,
well
done

That
's
the
right
spirit
,
and
I
never
*NL*
refuse
to
help
anybody
if
they
've
a
mind
to
do
themselves
justice

*NL*
There
's
a
young
man
of
two-and-twenty
I
've
got
my
eye
on
now

I
shall

do
what
I
can
for
that

's
got
some
pith
in
him

But
then
,
*NL*
you
see
,
he
's
made
good
use
of
his
time
,
--
a
first-rate
calculator
,
--
*NL*
can
tell
you
the
cubic
contents
of
anything
in
no
time

and
put
me
up
*NL*
the
other
day
to
a
new
market
for
Swedish
bark

he
's
uncommonly
*NL*
knowing
in
manufactures

that
young
fellow

*NL*
``
I
'd
better
set
about

Tom
,
anxious
to
prove
his
readiness
to
exert
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

yes

again

Well
Tom

there
's
nothing
more
to
be

just
now

go
to
business
again

Good-by

Remember
me
to
your

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Deane
put
out
his
hand
,
with
an
air
of
friendly
dismissal
,
and
Tom
*NL*
had
not
courage
to
ask
another
question
,
especially
in
the
presence
of
*NL*
Mr.
Spence
.
So
he
went
out
again
into
the
cold
damp
air
.
He
had
to
*NL*
call
at
his
uncle
Glegg
's
about
the
money
in
the
Savings
Bank
,
and
by
*NL*
the
time
he
set
out
again
the
mist
had
thickened
,
and
he
could
not
see
*NL*
very
far
before
him
;
but
going
along
River
Street
again
,
he
was
*NL*
startled
,
when
he
was
within
two
yards
of
the
projecting
side
of
a
*NL*
shop-window
,
by
the
words
``
Dorlcote
Mill
''
in
large
letters
on
a
*NL*
hand-bill
,
placed
as
if
on
purpose
to
stare
at
him
.
It
was
the
*NL*
catalogue
of
the
sale
to
take
place
the
next
week
;
it
was
a
reason
for
*NL*
hurrying
faster
out
of
the
town
.
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Tom
formed
no
visions
of
the
distant
future
as
he
made
his
way
*NL*
homeward
;
he
only
felt
that
the
present
was
very
hard
.
It
seemed
a
*NL*
wrong
toward
him
that
his
uncle
Deane
had
no
confidence
in
him
,
--
did
*NL*
not
see
at
once
that
he
should
acquit
himself
well
,
which
Tom
himself
*NL*
was
as
certain
of
as
of
the
daylight
.
Apparently
he
,
Tom
Tulliver
,
was
*NL*
likely
to
be
held
of
small
account
in
the
world
;
and
for
the
first
*NL*
time
he
felt
a
sinking
of
heart
under
the
sense
that
he
really
was
*NL*
very
ignorant
,
and
could
do
very
little
.
Who
was
that
enviable
young
*NL*
man
that
could
tell
the
cubic
contents
of
things
in
no
time
,
and
make
*NL*
suggestions
about
Swedish
bark
!
Tom
had
been
used
to
be
so
entirely
*NL*
satisfied
with
himself
,
in
spite
of
his
breaking
down
in
a
*NL*
demonstration
,
and
construing
_
nunc
illas
promite
vires
_
as
``
now
*NL*
promise
those
men
''
;
but
now
he
suddenly
felt
at
a
disadvantage
,
*NL*
because
he
knew
less
than
some
one
else
knew
.
There
must
be
a
world
of
*NL*
things
connected
with
that
Swedish
bark
,
which
,
if
he
only
knew
them
,
*NL*
might
have
helped
him
to
get
on
.
It
would
have
been
much
easier
to
*NL*
make
a
figure
with
a
spirited
horse
and
a
new
saddle
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
hours
ago
,
as
Tom
was
walking
to
St.
Ogg
's
,
he
saw
the
distant
*NL*
future
before
him
as
he
might
have
seen
a
tempting
stretch
of
smooth
*NL*
sandy
beach
beyond
a
belt
of
flinty
shingles
;
he
was
on
the
grassy
*NL*
bank
then
,
and
thought
the
shingles
might
soon
be
passed
.
But
now
his
*NL*
feet
were
on
the
sharp
stones
;
the
belt
of
shingles
had
widened
,
and
*NL*
the
stretch
of
sand
had
dwindled
into
narrowness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
did
my
Uncle
Deane
say
,
Tom
?
''
said
Maggie
,
putting
her
arm
*NL*
through
Tom
's
as
he
was
warming
himself
rather
drearily
by
the
kitchen
*NL*
fire
.
``
Did
he
say
he
would
give
you
a
situation
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
he
did
n't
say
that
.
He
did
n't
quite
promise
me
anything
;
he
*NL*
seemed
to
think
I
could
n't
have
a
very
good
situation
.
I
'm
too
young
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
did
n't
he
speak
kindly
,
Tom
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Kindly
?
Pooh
!
what
's
the
use
of
talking
about
that
?
I
would
n't
care
*NL*
about
his
speaking
kindly
,
if
I
could
get
a
situation
.
But
it
's
such
a
*NL*
nuisance
and
bother
;
I
've
been
at
school
all
this
while
learning
Latin
*NL*
and
things
,
--
not
a
bit
of
good
to
me
,
--
and
now
my
uncle
says
I
must
*NL*
set
about
learning
book-keeping
and
calculation
,
and
those
things
.
He
*NL*
seems
to
make
out
I
'm
good
for
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
's
mouth
twitched
with
a
bitter
expression
as
he
looked
at
the
*NL*
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
what
a
pity
we
have
n't
got
Dominie
Sampson
!
''
said
Maggie
,
who
*NL*
could
n't
help
mingling
some
gayety
with
their
sadness
.
``
If
he
had
*NL*
taught
me
book-keeping
by
double
entry
and
after
the
Italian
method
,
*NL*
as
he
did
Lucy
Bertram
,
I
could
teach
you
,
Tom
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
You
_
teach
!
Yes
,
I
dare
say
.
That
's
always
the
tone
you
take
,
''
said
*NL*
Tom
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
Tom
,
I
was
only
joking
,
''
said
Maggie
,
putting
her
cheek
against
*NL*
his
coat-sleeve
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
's
always
the
same
,
Maggie
,
''
said
Tom
,
with
the
little
frown
he
*NL*
put
on
when
he
was
about
to
be
justifiably
severe
.
``
You
're
always
*NL*
setting
yourself
up
above
me
and
every
one
else
,
and
I
've
wanted
to
*NL*
tell
you
about
it
several
times
.
You
ought
not
to
have
spoken
as
you
*NL*
did
to
my
uncles
and
aunts
;
you
should
leave
it
to
me
to
take
care
of
*NL*
my
mother
and
you
,
and
not
put
yourself
forward
.
You
think
you
know
*NL*
better
than
any
one
,
but
you
're
almost
always
wrong
.
I
can
judge
much
*NL*
better
than
you
can
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Tom
!
he
had
just
come
from
being
lectured
and
made
to
feel
his
*NL*
inferiority
;
the
reaction
of
his
strong
,
self-asserting
nature
must
*NL*
take
place
somehow
;
and
here
was
a
case
in
which
he
could
justly
show
*NL*
himself
dominant
.
Maggie
's
cheek
flushed
and
her
lip
quivered
with
*NL*
conflicting
resentment
and
affection
,
and
a
certain
awe
as
well
as
*NL*
admiration
of
Tom
's
firmer
and
more
effective
character
.
She
did
not
*NL*
answer
immediately
;
very
angry
words
rose
to
her
lips
,
but
they
were
*NL*
driven
back
again
,
and
she
said
at
last
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
often
think
I
'm
conceited
,
Tom
,
when
I
do
n't
mean
what
I
say
at
*NL*
all
in
that
way
.
I
do
n't
mean
to
put
myself
above
you
;
I
know
you
*NL*
behaved
better
than
I
did
yesterday
.
But
you
are
always
so
harsh
to
*NL*
me
,
Tom
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
the
last
words
the
resentment
was
rising
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
'm
not
harsh
,
''
said
Tom
,
with
severe
decision
.
``
I
'm
always
kind
*NL*
to
you
,
and
so
I
shall
be
;
I
shall
always
take
care
of
you
.
But
you
*NL*
must
mind
what
I
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Their
mother
came
in
now
,
and
Maggie
rushed
away
,
that
her
burst
of
*NL*
tears
,
which
she
felt
must
come
,
might
not
happen
till
she
was
safe
*NL*
upstairs
.
They
were
very
bitter
tears
;
everybody
in
the
world
seemed
*NL*
so
hard
and
unkind
to
Maggie
;
there
was
no
indulgence
,
no
fondness
,
*NL*
such
as
she
imagined
when
she
fashioned
the
world
afresh
in
her
own
*NL*
thoughts
.
In
books
there
were
people
who
were
always
agreeable
or
*NL*
tender
,
and
delighted
to
do
things
that
made
one
happy
,
and
who
did
*NL*
not
show
their
kindness
by
finding
fault
.
The
world
outside
the
books
*NL*
was
not
a
happy
one
,
Maggie
felt
;
it
seemed
to
be
a
world
where
people
*NL*
behaved
the
best
to
those
they
did
not
pretend
to
love
,
and
that
did
*NL*
not
belong
to
them
.
And
if
life
had
no
love
in
it
,
what
else
was
there
*NL*
for
Maggie
?
Nothing
but
poverty
and
the
companionship
of
her
mother
's
*NL*
narrow
griefs
,
perhaps
of
her
father
's
heart-cutting
childish
*NL*
dependence
.
There
is
no
hopelessness
so
sad
as
that
of
early
youth
,
*NL*
when
the
soul
is
made
up
of
wants
,
and
has
no
long
memories
,
no
*NL*
superadded
life
in
the
life
of
others
;
though
we
who
looked
on
think
*NL*
lightly
of
such
premature
despair
,
as
if
our
vision
of
the
future
*NL*
lightened
the
blind
sufferer
's
present
.
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
,
in
her
brown
frock
,
with
her
eyes
reddened
and
her
heavy
hair
*NL*
pushed
back
,
looking
from
the
bed
where
her
father
lay
to
the
dull
*NL*
walls
of
this
sad
chamber
which
was
the
centre
of
her
world
,
was
a
*NL*
creature
full
of
eager
,
passionate
longings
for
all
that
was
beautiful
*NL*
and
glad
;
thirsty
for
all
knowledge
;
with
an
ear
straining
after
*NL*
dreamy
music
that
died
away
and
would
not
come
near
to
her
;
with
a
*NL*
blind
,
unconscious
yearning
for
something
that
would
link
together
the
*NL*
wonderful
impressions
of
this
mysterious
life
,
and
give
her
soul
a
*NL*
sense
of
home
in
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
wonder
,
when
there
is
this
contrast
between
the
outward
and
the
*NL*
inward
,
that
painful
collisions
come
of
it
.

begun
,
in
his
intervals
of
consciousness
,
to
manifest
an
irritability
*NL*
which
often
appeared
to
have
as
a
direct
effect
the
recurrence
of
*NL*
spasmodic
rigidity
and
insensibility
,
had
lain
in
this
living
death
*NL*
throughout
the
critical
hours
when
the
noise
of
the
sale
came
nearest
*NL*
to
his
chamber
.
Mr.
Turnbull
had
decided
that
it
would
be
a
less
risk
*NL*
to
let
him
remain
where
he
was
than
to
remove
him
to
Luke
's
*NL*
cottage
,
--
a
plan
which
the
good
Luke
had
proposed
to
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
*NL*
thinking
it
would
be
very
bad
if
the
master
were
``
to
waken
up
''
at
the
*NL*
noise
of
the
sale
;
and
the
wife
and
children
had
sat
imprisoned
in
the
*NL*
silent
chamber
,
watching
the
large
prostrate
figure
on
the
bed
,
and
*NL*
trembling
lest
the
blank
face
should
suddenly
show
some
response
to
*NL*
the
sounds
which
fell
on
their
own
ears
with
such
obstinate
,
painful
*NL*
repetition
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
was
over
at
last
,
that
time
of
importunate
certainty
and
*NL*
eye-straining
suspense
.
The
sharp
sound
of
a
voice
,
almost
as
metallic
*NL*
as
the
rap
that
followed
it
,
had
ceased
;
the
tramping
of
footsteps
on
*NL*
the
gravel
had
died
out
.
Mrs.
Tulliver
's
blond
face
seemed
aged
ten
*NL*
years
by
the
last
thirty
hours
;
the
poor
woman
's
mind
had
been
busy
*NL*
divining
when
her
favorite
things
were
being
knocked
down
by
the
*NL*
terrible
hammer
;
her
heart
had
been
fluttering
at
the
thought
that
*NL*
first
one
thing
and
then
another
had
gone
to
be
identified
as
hers
in
*NL*
the
hateful
publicity
of
the
Golden
Lion
;
and
all
the
while
she
had
to
*NL*
sit
and
make
no
sign
of
this
inward
agitation
.
Such
things
bring
lines
*NL*
in
well-rounded
faces
,
and
broaden
the
streaks
of
white
among
the
*NL*
hairs
that
once
looked
as
if
they
had
been
dipped
in
pure
sunshine
.
*NL*
Already
,
at
three
o'clock
,
Kezia
,
the
good-hearted
,
bad-tempered
*NL*
housemaid
,
who
regarded
all
people
that
came
to
the
sale
as
her
*NL*
personal
enemies
,
the
dirt
on
whose
feet
was
of
a
peculiarly
vile
*NL*
quality
,
had
begun
to
scrub
and
swill
with
an
energy
much
assisted
by
*NL*
a
continual
low
muttering
against
``
folks
as
came
to
buy
up
other
*NL*
folk
's
things
,
''
and
made
light
of
``
scrazing
''
the
tops
of
mahogany
*NL*
tables
over
which
better
folks
than
themselves
had
had
to
--
suffer
a
*NL*
waste
of
tissue
through
evaporation
.
She
was
not
scrubbing
*NL*
indiscriminately
,
for
there
would
be
further
dirt
of
the
same
*NL*
atrocious
kind
made
by
people
who
had
still
to
fetch
away
their
*NL*
purchases
;
but
she
was
bent
on
bringing
the
parlor
,
where
that
*NL*
``
pipe-smoking
pig
,
''
the
bailiff
,
had
sat
,
to
such
an
appearance
of
*NL*
scant
comfort
as
could
be
given
to
it
by
cleanliness
and
the
few
*NL*
articles
of
furniture
bought
in
for
the
family
.
Her
mistress
and
the
*NL*
young
folks
should
have
their
tea
in
it
that
night
,
Kezia
was
*NL*
determined
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
between
five
and
six
o'clock
,
near
the
usual
teatime
,
when
she
*NL*
came
upstairs
and
said
that
Master
Tom
was
wanted
.
The
person
who
*NL*
wanted
him
was
in
the
kitchen
,
and
in
the
first
moments
,
by
the
*NL*
imperfect
fire
and
candle
light
,
Tom
had
not
even
an
indefinite
sense
*NL*
of
any
acquaintance
with
the
rather
broad-set
but
active
figure
,
*NL*
perhaps
two
years
older
than
himself
,
that
looked
at
him
with
a
pair
*NL*
of
blue
eyes
set
in
a
disc
of
freckles
,
and
pulled
some
curly
red
*NL*
locks
with
a
strong
intention
of
respect
.
A
low-crowned
*NL*
oilskin-covered
hat
,
and
a
certain
shiny
deposit
of
dirt
on
the
rest
*NL*
of
the
costume
,
as
of
tablets
prepared
for
writing
upon
,
suggested
a
*NL*
calling
that
had
to
do
with
boats
;
but
this
did
not
help
Tom
's
memory
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sarvant
,
Master
Tom
,
''
said
he
of
the
red
locks
,
with
a
smile
which
*NL*
seemed
to
break
through
a
self-imposed
air
of
melancholy
.
``
You
do
n't
*NL*
know
me
again
,
I
doubt
,
''
he
went
on
,
as
Tom
continued
to
look
at
him
*NL*
inquiringly
;
``
but
I
'd
like
to
talk
to
you
by
yourself
a
bit
,
please
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
a
fire
i
'
the
parlor
,
Master
Tom
,
''
said
Kezia
,
who
objected
*NL*
to
leaving
the
kitchen
in
the
crisis
of
toasting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
this
way
,
then
,
''
said
Tom
,
wondering
if
this
young
fellow
*NL*
belonged
to
Guest
&
Co.
's
Wharf
,
for
his
imagination
ran
continually
*NL*
toward
that
particular
spot
;
and
uncle
Deane
might
any
time
be
sending
*NL*
for
him
to
say
that
there
was
a
situation
at
liberty
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
bright
fire
in
the
parlor
was
the
only
light
that
showed
the
few
*NL*
chairs
,
the
bureau
,
the
carpetless
floor
,
and
the
one
table
--
no
,
not
*NL*
the
_
one
_
table
;
there
was
a
second
table
,
in
a
corner
,
with
a
large
*NL*
Bible
and
a
few
other
books
upon
it
.
It
was
this
new
strange
bareness
*NL*
that
Tom
felt
first
,
before
he
thought
of
looking
again
at
the
face
*NL*
which
was
also
lit
up
by
the
fire
,
and
which
stole
a
half-shy
,
*NL*
questioning
glance
at
him
as
the
entirely
strange
voice
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
!
you
do
n't
remember
Bob
,
then
,
as
you
gen
the
pocket-knife
to
,
*NL*
Mr.
Tom
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
rough-handled
pocket-knife
was
taken
out
in
the
same
moment
,
and
*NL*
the
largest
blade
opened
by
way
of
irresistible
demonstration
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
Bob
Jakin
?
''
said
Tom
,
not
with
any
cordial
delight
,
for
he
felt
*NL*
a
little
ashamed
of
that
early
intimacy
symbolized
by
the
*NL*
pocket-knife
,
and
was
not
at
all
sure
that
Bob
's
motives
for
recalling
*NL*
it
were
entirely
admirable
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
ay
,
Bob
Jakin
,
if
Jakin
it
must
be

'cause
there
's
so
many

as
you
went
arter
the
squerrils
with

that
day
as
I
plumped
right
down
*NL*
from

bough
,
and
bruised
my
shins
a
good
un

but
I
got
the
squerril
*NL*
tight

afore

''
*NL*
*NL*
Bob
spoke
with
a
sharp
and
rather
treble
volubility
,
and
got
through
*NL*
his
long
speech
with
surprising
despatch
,
giving
the
blade
of
his
*NL*
knife
an
affectionate
rub
on
his
sleeve
when
he
had
finished
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Bob
,
''
said
Tom
,
with
a
slight
air
of
patronage
,
the
foregoing
*NL*
reminscences
having
disposed
him
to
be
as
friendly
as
was
becoming
,
*NL*
though
there
was
no
part
of
his
acquaintance
with
Bob
that
he
*NL*
remembered
better
than
the
cause
of
their
parting
quarrel
;
``
is
there
*NL*
anything
I
can
do
for
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
no
,
Mr.
Tom
,
''
answered
Bob
,
shutting
up
his
knife
with
a
click
*NL*
and
returning
it
to
his
pocket
,
where
he
seemed
to
be
feeling
for
*NL*
something
else
.
``
I

''
*NL*
*NL*
Bob
had
drawn
out
a
dirty
canvas
bag
,
and
would
perhaps
not
have
*NL*
paused
just
then
if
Maggie
had
not
entered
the
room
and
darted
a
look
*NL*
of
surprise
and
curiosity
at
him
,
whereupon
he
pulled
his
red
locks
*NL*
again
with
due
respect
.
But
the
next
moment
the
sense
of
the
altered
*NL*
room
came
upon
Maggie
with
a
force
that
overpowered
the
thought
of
*NL*
Bob
's
presence
.
Her
eyes
had
immediately
glanced
from
him
to
the
place
*NL*
where
the
bookcase
had
hung
;
there
was
nothing
now
but
the
oblong
*NL*
unfaded
space
on
the
wall
,
and
below
it
the
small
table
with
the
Bible
*NL*
and
the
few
other
books
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Tom
!
''
she
burst
out
,
clasping
her
hands
,
``
where
are
the
books
?
I
*NL*
thought
my
uncle
Glegg
said
he
would
buy
them

Did

he
?
Are
those
*NL*
all
they
've
left

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
so
,
''
said
Tom
,
with
a
sort
of
desperate
indifference
.
``
Why
*NL*
should
they
buy
many
books
when
they
bought
so
little
furniture

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
but
,
Tom
,
''
said
Maggie
,
her
eyes
filling
with
tears
,
as
she
*NL*
rushed
up
to
the
table
to
see
what
books
had
been
rescued
.
``
Our
dear
*NL*
old
Pilgrim
's
Progress

you
colored
with
your
little

Pilgrim
with
a
mantle
on
,
looking
just
like
a
*NL*
turtle

oh
dear
!
''
Maggie
went
on
,
half
sobbing
as
she
turned
over
the
*NL*
few
books
,
``
I
thought
we
should
never
part
with
that
while

*NL*
everything

end
of

nothing

*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
turned
away
from
the
table
and
threw
herself
into
a
chair
,
with
*NL*
the
big
tears
ready
to
roll
down
her
cheeks
,
quite
blinded
to
the
*NL*
presence
of
Bob
,
who
was
looking
at
her
with
the
pursuant
gaze
of
an
*NL*
intelligent
dumb
animal
,
with
perceptions
more
perfect
than
his
*NL*
comprehension
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Bob
,
''
said
Tom
,
feeling
that
the
subject
of
the
books
was
*NL*
unseasonable
,
``
I
suppose
you
just
came
to
see
me
because
we
're
in
*NL*
trouble

That
was
very
good-natured
of
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
tell
you
how
it
is

said
Bob
,
beginning
to
untwist
*NL*
his
canvas
bag
.
``
You

between
whiles

at

mill

But
a
fortni

t
ago
I
'd
a
*NL*
rare
bit
o

luck

I
allays
thought
I
was
a
lucky
chap

for
I
niver

set
a

what
I
catched
something
;
but
this
was

it

Here
Bob
emptied
the
canvas
*NL*
bag
on
the
table
.
``
An
'
when
I
'd
got
'em
,
my
head
was
all
of
a
boil
*NL*
like
a
kettle

thinkin

first
I

I
thought

I
should
like
a

way
*NL*
o

life

I
did

so
well

at

I
settled

*NL*

I

there

be
a
use
for
*NL*
a

no

*NL*
*NL*
Bob
paused
,
and
then
said
,
with
defiant
decision
,
as
if
resolutely
*NL*
turning
his
back
on
that
paradisaic
picture
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
do
n't

*NL*
*NL*
Tom
was
touched
keenly
enough
to
forget
his
pride
and
suspicion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You

he
said
,
coloring

with
that

in
his

gave
a

to

Bob
pushed

forward

before
Tom
could
speak
Maggie
,
*NL*
clasping
her
hands

looking
penitently
at

said
:

*NL*
*NL*
Bob
had
not
been
aware
of
the
injurious
opinion
for
which
Maggie
was
*NL*
performing
an
inward
act
of
penitence
,
but
he
smiled
with
pleasure
at
*NL*
this
handsome
eulogy

especially
from
a
young

as
he

informed
his

had

put
out
his

was
not

While
Bob
was
speaking
he
laid
down
the
sovereign

resolutely
*NL*
twisted
up
his

again

Tom
pushed
back
the
gold

said

``

And

taking

between

fingers

held
it
up

said

more

persuasively

How
a
Hen
Takes
to
Stratagem
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
days
passed
,
and
Mr.
Tulliver
showed
,
at
least
to
the
eyes
of
the
*NL*
medical
man
,
stronger
and
stronger
symptoms
of
a
gradual
return
to
his
*NL*
normal
condition
;
the
paralytic
obstruction
was
,
little
by
little
,
*NL*
losing
its
tenacity
,
and
the
mind
was
rising
from
under
it
with
fitful
*NL*
struggles
,
like
a
living
creature
making
its
way
from
under
a
great
*NL*
snowdrift
,
that
slides
and
slides
again
,
and
shuts
up
the
newly
made
*NL*
opening
.
*NL*
*NL*
Time
would
have
seemed
to
creep
to
the
watchers
by
the
bed
,
if
it
had
*NL*
only
been
measured
by
the
doubtful
,
distant
hope
which
kept
count
of
*NL*
the
moments
within
the
chamber
;
but
it
was
measured
for
them
by
a
*NL*
fast-approaching
dread
which
made
the
nights
come
too
quickly
.
While
*NL*
Mr.
Tulliver
was
slowly
becoming
himself
again
,
his
lot
was
hastening
*NL*
toward
its
moment
of
most
palpable
change
.
The
taxing-masters
had
done
*NL*
their
work
like
any
respectable
gunsmith
conscientiously
preparing
the
*NL*
musket
,
that
,
duly
pointed
by
a
brave
arm
,
will
spoil
a
life
or
two
.
*NL*
Allocaturs
,
filing
of
bills
in
Chancery
,
decrees
of
sale
,
are
legal
*NL*
chain-shot
or
bomb-shells
that
can
never
hit
a
solitary
mark
,
but
must
*NL*
fall
with
widespread
shattering
.
So
deeply
inherent
is
it
in
this
life
*NL*
of
ours
that
men
have
to
suffer
for
each
other
's
sins
,
so
inevitably
*NL*
diffusive
is
human
suffering
,
that
even
justice
makes
its
victims
,
and
*NL*
we
can
conceive
no
retribution
that
does
not
spread
beyond
its
mark
in
*NL*
pulsations
of
unmerited
pain
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
the
beginning
of
the
second
week
in
January
,
the
bills
were
out
*NL*
advertising
the
sale
,
under
a
decree
of
Chancery
,
of
Mr.
Tulliver
's
*NL*
farming
and
other
stock
,
to
be
followed
by
a
sale
of
the
mill
and
*NL*
land
,
held
in
the
proper
after-dinner
hour
at
the
Golden
Lion
.
The
*NL*
miller
himself
,
unaware
of
the
lapse
of
time
,
fancied
himself
still
in
*NL*
that
first
stage
of
his
misfortunes
when
expedients
might
be
thought
*NL*
of
;
and
often
in
his
conscious
hours
talked
in
a
feeble
,
disjointed
*NL*
manner
of
plans
he
would
carry
out
when
he
``
got
well
.
''
The
wife
and
*NL*
children
were
not
without
hope
of
an
issue
that
would
at
least
save
*NL*
Mr.
Tulliver
from
leaving
the
old
spot
,
and
seeking
an
entirely
*NL*
strange
life
.
For
uncle
Deane
had
been
induced
to
interest
himself
in
*NL*
this
stage
of
the
business
.
It
would
not
,
he
acknowledged
,
be
a
bad
*NL*
speculation
for
Guest
&
Co.
to
buy
Dorlcote
Mill
,
and
carry
on
the
*NL*
business
,
which
was
a
good
one
,
and
might
be
increased
by
the
addition
*NL*
of
steam
power
;
in
which
case
Tulliver
might
be
retained
as
manager
.
*NL*
Still
,
Mr.
Deane
would
say
nothing
decided
about
the
matter
;
the
fact
*NL*
that
Wakem
held
the
mortgage
on
the
land
might
put
it
into
his
head
to
*NL*
bid
for
the
whole
estate
,
and
further
,
to
outbid
the
cautious
firm
of
*NL*
Guest
&
Co.
,
who
did
not
carry
on
business
on
sentimental
grounds
.
Mr.
*NL*
Deane
was
obliged
to
tell
Mrs.
Tulliver
something
to
that
effect
,
when
*NL*
he
rode
over
to
the
mill
to
inspect
the
books
in
company
with
Mrs.
*NL*
Glegg
;
for
she
had
observed
that
``
if
Guest
&
Co.
would
only
think
about
*NL*
it
,
Mr.
Tulliver
's
father
and
grandfather
had
been
carrying
on
*NL*
Dorlcote
Mill
long
before
the
oil-mill
of
that
firm
had
been
so
much
*NL*
as
thought
of
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Deane
,
in
reply
,
doubted
whether
that
was
precisely
the
relation
*NL*
between
the
two
mills
which
would
determine
their
value
as
*NL*
investments
.
As
for
uncle
Glegg
,
the
thing
lay
quite
beyond
his
*NL*
imagination
;
the
good-natured
man
felt
sincere
pity
for
the
Tulliver
*NL*
family
,
but
his
money
was
all
locked
up
in
excellent
mortgages
,
and
he
*NL*
could
run
no
risk
;
that
would
be
unfair
to
his
own
relatives
;
but
he
*NL*
had
made
up
his
mind
that
Tulliver
should
have
some
new
flannel
*NL*
waistcoats
which
he
had
himself
renounced
in
favor
of
a
more
elastic
*NL*
commodity
,
and
that
he
would
buy
Mrs.
Tulliver
a
pound
of
tea
now
and
*NL*
then
;
it
would
be
a
journey
which
his
benevolence
delighted
in
*NL*
beforehand
,
to
carry
the
tea
and
see
her
pleasure
on
being
assured
it
*NL*
was
the
best
black
.
*NL*
*NL*
Still
,
it
was
clear
that
Mr.
Deane
was
kindly
disposed
toward
the
*NL*
Tullivers
.
One
day
he
had
brought
Lucy
,
who
was
come
home
for
the
*NL*
Christmas
holidays
,
and
the
little
blond
angel-head
had
pressed
itself
*NL*
against
Maggie
's
darker
cheek
with
many
kisses
and
some
tears
.
These
*NL*
fair
slim
daughters
keep
up
a
tender
spot
in
the
heart
of
many
a
*NL*
respectable
partner
in
a
respectable
firm
,
and
perhaps
Lucy
's
anxious
,
*NL*
pitying
questions
about
her
poor
cousins
helped
to
make
uncle
Deane
*NL*
more
prompt
in
finding
Tom
a
temporary
place
in
the
warehouse
,
and
in
*NL*
putting
him
in
the
way
of
getting
evening
lessons
in
book-keeping
and
*NL*
calculation
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
might
have
cheered
the
lad
and
fed
his
hopes
a
little
,
if
there
*NL*
had
not
come
at
the
same
time
the
much-dreaded
blow
of
finding
that
*NL*
his
father
must
be
a
bankrupt
,
after
all
;
at
least
,
the
creditors
must
*NL*
be
asked
to
take
less
than
their
due
,
which
to
Tom
's
untechnical
mind
*NL*
was
the
same
thing
as
bankruptcy
.
His
father
must
not
only
be
said
to
*NL*
have
``
lost
his
property
,
''
but
to
have
``
failed
,
''
--
the
word
that
carried
*NL*
the
worst
obloquy
to
Tom
's
mind
.
For
when
the
defendant
's
claim
for
*NL*
costs
had
been
satisfied
,
there
would
remain
the
friendly
bill
of
Mr.
*NL*
Gore
,
and
the
deficiency
at
the
bank
,
as
well
as
the
other
debts
which
*NL*
would
make
the
assets
shrink
into
unequivocal
disproportion
;
``
not
more
*NL*
than
ten
or
twelve
shillings
in
the
pound
,
''
predicted
Mr.
Deane
,
in
a
*NL*
decided
tone
,
tightening
his
lips
;
and
the
words
fell
on
Tom
like
a
*NL*
scalding
liquied
,
leaving
a
continual
smart
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
sadly
in
want
of
something
to
keep
up
his
spirits
a
little
in
*NL*
the
unpleasant
newness
of
his
position
,
--
suddenly
transported
from
the
*NL*
easy
carpeted
_
ennui
_
of
study-hours
at
Mr.
Stelling
's
,
and
the
busy
*NL*
idleness
of
castle-building
in
a
``
last
half
''
at
school
,
to
the
*NL*
companionship
of
sacks
and
hides
,
and
bawling
men
thundering
down
*NL*
heavy
weights
at
his
elbow
.
The
first
step
toward
getting
on
in
the
*NL*
world
was
a
chill
,
dusty
,
noisy
affair
,
and
implied
going
without
*NL*
one
's
tea
in
order
to
stay
in
St.
Ogg
's
and
have
an
evening
lesson
*NL*
from
a
one-armed
elderly
clerk
,
in
a
room
smelling
strongly
of
bad
*NL*
tobacco
.
Tom
's
young
pink-and-white
face
had
its
colors
very
much
*NL*
deadened
by
the
time
he
took
off
his
hat
at
home
,
and
sat
down
with
*NL*
keen
hunger
to
his
supper
.
No
wonder
he
was
a
little
cross
if
his
*NL*
mother
or
Maggie
spoke
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
all
this
while
Mrs.
Tulliver
was
brooding
over
a
scheme
by
which
*NL*
she
,
and
no
one
else
,
would
avert
the
result
most
to
be
dreaded
,
and
*NL*
prevent
Wakem
from
entertaining
the
purpose
of
bidding
for
the
mill
.
*NL*
Imagine
a
truly
respectable
and
amiable
hen
,
by
some
portentous
*NL*
anomaly
,
taking
to
reflection
and
inventing
combinations
by
which
she
*NL*
might
prevail
on
Hodge
not
to
wring
her
neck
,
or
send
her
and
her
*NL*
chicks
to
market
;
the
result
could
hardly
be
other
than
much
cackling
*NL*
and
fluttering
.
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
seeing
that
everything
had
gone
wrong
,
*NL*
had
begun
to
think
she
had
been
too
passive
in
life
;
and
that
,
if
she
*NL*
had
applied
her
mind
to
business
,
and
taken
a
strong
resolution
now
*NL*
and
then
,
it
would
have
been
all
the
better
for
her
and
her
family
.
*NL*
Nobody
,
it
appeared
,
had
thought
of
going
to
speak
to
Wakem
on
this
*NL*
business
of
the
mill
;
and
yet
,
Mrs.
Tulliver
reflected
,
it
would
have
*NL*
been
quite
the
shortest
method
of
securing
the
right
end
.
It
would
*NL*
have
been
of
no
use
,
to
be
sure
,
for
Mr.
Tulliver
to
go
,
--
even
if
he
*NL*
had
been
able
and
willing
,
--
for
he
had
been
``
going
to
law
against
*NL*
Wakem
''
and
abusing
him
for
the
last
ten
years
;
Wakem
was
always
likely
*NL*
to
have
a
spite
against
him
.
And
now
that
Mrs.
Tulliver
had
come
to
*NL*
the
conclusion
that
her
husband
was
very
much
in
the
wrong
to
bring
*NL*
her
into
this
trouble
,
she
was
inclined
to
think
that
his
opinion
of
*NL*
Wakem
was
wrong
too
.
To
be
sure
,
Wakem
had
``
put
the
bailies
in
the
*NL*
house
,
and
sold
them
up
''
;
but
she
supposed
he
did
that
to
please
the
*NL*
man
that
lent
Mr.
Tulliver
the
money
,
for
a
lawyer
had
more
folks
to
*NL*
please
than
one
,
and
he
was
n't
likely
to
put
Mr.
Tulliver
,
who
had
*NL*
gone
to
law
with
him
,
above
everybody
else
in
the
world
.
The
attorney
*NL*
might
be
a
very
reasonable
man
;
why
not
?
He
had
married
a
Miss
Clint
,
*NL*
and
at
the
time
Mrs.
Tulliver
had
heard
of
that
marriage
,
the
summer
*NL*
when
she
wore
her
blue
satin
spencer
,
and
had
not
yet
any
thoughts
of
*NL*
Mr.
Tulliver
,
she
knew
no
harm
of
Wakem
.
And
certainly
toward
herself
,
*NL*
whom
he
knew
to
have
been
a
Miss
Dodson
,
it
was
out
of
all
possibility
*NL*
that
he
could
entertain
anything
but
good-will
,
when
it
was
once
*NL*
brought
home
to
his
observation
that
she
,
for
her
part
,
had
never
*NL*
wanted
to
go
to
law
,
and
indeed
was
at
present
disposed
to
take
Mr.
*NL*
Wakem
's
view
of
all
subjects
rather
than
her
husband
's
.
In
fact
,
if
*NL*
that
attorney
saw
a
respectable
matron
like
herself
disposed
``
to
give
*NL*
him
good
words
,
''
why
should
n't
he
listen
to
her
representations
?
For
*NL*
she
would
put
the
matter
clearly
before
him
,
which
had
never
been
done
*NL*
yet
.
And
he
would
never
go
and
bid
for
the
mill
on
purpose
to
spite
*NL*
her
,
an
innocent
woman
,
who
thought
it
likely
enough
that
she
had
*NL*
danced
with
him
in
their
youth
at
Squire
Darleigh
's
,
for
at
those
big
*NL*
dances
she
had
often
and
often
danced
with
young
men
whose
names
she
*NL*
had
forgotten
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Tulliver
hid
these
reasonings
in
her
own
bosom
;
for
when
she
had
*NL*
thrown
out
a
hint
to
Mr.
Deane
and
Mr.
Glegg
that
she
would
n't
mind
*NL*
going
to
speak
to
Wakem
herself
,
they
had
said
,
``
No
,
no
,
no
,
''
and
*NL*
``
Pooh
,
pooh
,
''
and
``
Let
Wakem
alone
,
''
in
the
tone
of
men
who
were
not
*NL*
likely
to
give
a
candid
attention
to
a
more
definite
exposition
of
her
*NL*
project
;
still
less
dared
she
mention
the
plan
to
Tom
and
Maggie
,
for
*NL*
``
the
children
were
always
so
against
everything
their
mother
said
''
;
*NL*
and
Tom
,
she
observed
,
was
almost
as
much
set
against
Wakem
as
his
*NL*
father
was
.
But
this
unusual
concentration
of
thought
naturally
gave
*NL*
Mrs.
Tulliver
an
unusual
power
of
device
and
determination
:
and
a
day
*NL*
or
two
before
the
sale
,
to
be
held
at
the
Golden
Lion
,
when
there
was
*NL*
no
longer
any
time
to
be
lost
,
she
carried
out
her
plan
by
a
*NL*
stratagem
.
There
were
pickles
in
question
,
a
large
stock
of
pickles
*NL*
and
ketchup
which
Mrs.
Tulliver
possessed
,
and
which
Mr.
Hyndmarsh
,
*NL*
the
grocer
,
would
certainly
purchase
if
she
could
transact
the
*NL*
business
in
a
personal
interview
,
so
she
would
walk
with
Tom
to
St.
*NL*
Ogg
's
that
morning
;
and
when
Tom
urged
that
she
might
let
the
pickles
*NL*
be
at
present
,
--
he
did
n't
like
her
to
go
about
just
yet
,
--
she
appeared
*NL*
so
hurt
at
this
conduct
in
her
son
,
contradicting
her
about
pickles
*NL*
which
she
had
made
after
the
family
receipts
inherited
from
his
own
*NL*
grandmother
,
who
had
died
when
his
mother
was
a
little
girl
,
that
he
*NL*
gave
way
,
and
they
walked
together
until
she
turned
toward
Danish
*NL*
Street
,
where
Mr.
Hyndmarsh
retailed
his
grocery
,
not
far
from
the
*NL*
offices
of
Mr.
Wakem
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
gentleman
was
not
yet
come
to
his
office
;
would
Mrs.
Tulliver
sit
*NL*
down
by
the
fire
in
his
private
room
and
wait
for
him
?
She
had
not
*NL*
long
to
wait
before
the
punctual
attorney
entered
,
knitting
his
brow
*NL*
with
an
examining
glance
at
the
stout
blond
woman
who
rose
,
curtsying
*NL*
deferentially
,
--
a
tallish
man
,
with
an
aquiline
nose
and
abundant
*NL*
iron-gray
hair
.
You
have
never
seen
Mr.
Wakem
before
,
and
are
possibly
*NL*
wondering
whether
he
was
really
as
eminent
a
rascal
,
and
as
crafty
,
*NL*
bitter
an
enemy
of
honest
humanity
in
general
,
and
of
Mr.
Tulliver
in
*NL*
particular
,
as
he
is
represented
to
be
in
that
eidolon
or
portrait
of
*NL*
him
which
we
have
seen
to
exist
in
the
miller
's
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
clear
that
the
irascible
miller
was
a
man
to
interpret
any
*NL*
chance-shot
that
grazed
him
as
an
attempt
on
his
own
life
,
and
was
*NL*
liable
to
entanglements
in
this
puzzling
world
,
which
,
due
*NL*
consideration
had
to
his
own
infallibility
,
required
the
hypothesis
of
*NL*
a
very
active
diabolical
agency
to
explain
them
.
It
is
still
possible
*NL*
to
believe
that
the
attorney
was
not
more
guilty
toward
him
than
an
*NL*
ingenious
machine
,
which
performs
its
work
with
much
regularity
,
is
*NL*
guilty
toward
the
rash
man
who
,
venturing
too
near
it
,
is
caught
up
by
*NL*
some
fly-wheel
or
other
,
and
suddenly
converted
into
unexpected
*NL*
mince-meat
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
is
really
impossible
to
decide
this
question
by
a
glance
at
his
*NL*
person
;
the
lines
and
lights
of
the
human
countenance
are
like
other
*NL*
symbols
,
--
not
always
easy
to
read
without
a
key
.
On
an
_
a
priori
_
view
*NL*
of
Wakem
's
aquiline
nose
,
which
offended
Mr.
Tulliver
,
there
was
not
*NL*
more
rascality
than
in
the
shape
of
his
stiff
shirt-collar
,
though
*NL*
this
too
along
with
his
nose
,
might
have
become
fraught
with
damnatory
*NL*
meaning
when
once
the
rascality
was
ascertained
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
I
think
?
''
said
Mr.
Wakem
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
;
Miss
Elizabeth
Dodson
as
was
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pray
be
seated
.
You
have
some
business
with
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
sir
,
yes
,
''
said
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
beginning
to
feel
alarmed
at
her
*NL*
own
courage
,
now
she
was
really
in
presence
of
the
formidable
man
,
and
*NL*
reflecting
that
she
had
not
settled
with
herself
how
she
should
begin
.
*NL*
Mr.
Wakem
felt
in
his
waistcoat
pockets
,
and
looked
at
her
in
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
,
sir
,
''
she
began
at
last
,
--
``
I
hope
,
sir
,
you
're
not
a-thinking
*NL*
as
_
I
_
bear
you
any
ill-will
because
o
'
my
husband
's
losing
his
*NL*
lawsuit
,
and
the
bailies
being
put
in
,
and
the
linen
being
sold
,
--
oh
*NL*
dear
!
--
for
I
was
n't
brought
up
in
that
way
.
I
'm
sure
you
remember
my
*NL*
father
,
sir
,
for
he
was
close
friends
with
Squire
Darleigh
,
and
we
*NL*
allays
went
to
the
dances
there
,
the
Miss
Dodsons
,

nobody
could
be

four
of
us
,
and
you
're

quite
aware

Mrs.
Glegg

Mrs.
Deane
are
my
sisters

And
as
for
*NL*
going
to
law
and
losing
money
,
and
having
sales
before
you
're
dead
,
I
*NL*
never
saw
anything
o

that
before
I
was
married

nor
for
a
long
while
*NL*
after
.
And
I
'm
not
to
be
answerable
for
my
bad
luck
i
'
marrying
out
o

*NL*
my
own
family
into
one
where
the
goings-on
was
different
.
And
as
for

being
drawn
in
t

abuse
you
as
other
folks
abuse

sir
,
_
that
_
I
*NL*
niver
was
,
and
nobody
can
say
it
of
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Tulliver
shook
her
head
a
little
,
and
looked
at
the
hem
of
her
*NL*
pocket-handkerchief
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
no
doubt
of
what
you
say
,
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
''
said
Mr.
Wakem
,
with
*NL*
cold
politeness
.
``
But
you
have
some
question
to
ask

?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

,
yes

But
that
's
what
I
've
said

I

as
for

himself
for

two

I
'm
not
a-defending

hot
about

not

what
there

worse

for

he
never

not

as
for
his
fieriness
and
lawing
,
what
could

do

And
him
struck
as
if

it
was
with
death
when

got
the
letter

said

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
does
all

Mr.

rather

sharply

a

little
,

speaking
more
hurriedly
,

*NL*
*NL*
Something
like
a
new

flashed
across
Mr.

face
as
he

said
,

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
well
,
who
was
it
that

said
Wakem
,
opening
his
*NL*
desk
,
and
moving
things
about
,
with
the
accompaniment
of
an
almost
*NL*
inaudible
whistle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

sir
,
it
was
Mr.
Glegg
and
Mr.
Deane
,
as
have
all
the
management
;
*NL*
and
Mr.
Deane
thinks
as
Guest
&
Co.
`
ud
buy
the
mill
and
let
Mr.
*NL*
Tulliver
work
it
for
'em
,
if
you
did
n't
bid
for
it
and
raise
the
*NL*
price
.
And
it
`
ud
be
such
a
thing
for
my
husband
to
stay
where
he
is
,
*NL*
if
he
could
get
his
living
:
for
it
was
his
father
's
before
him
,
the
*NL*
mill
was
,
and
his
grandfather
built
it
,
though
I
was
n't
fond
o
'
the
*NL*
noise
of
it
,
when
first
I
was
married
,
for
there
was
no
mills
in
our
*NL*
family
,
--
not
the
Dodson
's
,
--
and
if
I
'd
known
as
the
mills
had
so
much
*NL*
to
do
with
the
law
,
it
would
n't
have
been
me
as
`
ud
have
been
the
*NL*
first
Dodson
to
marry
one
;
but
I
went
into
it
blindfold
,
that
I
did
,
*NL*
erigation
and
everything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
Guest
&
Co.
would
keep
the
mill
in
their
own
hands
,
I
suppose
,
*NL*
and
pay
your
husband
wages
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
dear
,
sir
,
it
's
hard
to
think
of
,
''
said
poor
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
a
*NL*
little
tear
making
its
way
,
``
as
my
husband
should
take
wage
.
But
it
*NL*
`
ud
look
more
like
what
used
to
be
,
to
stay
at
the
mill
than
to
go
*NL*
anywhere
else
;
and
if
you
'll
only
think
--
if
you
was
to
bid
for
the
*NL*
mill
and
buy
it
,
my
husband
might
be
struck
worse
than
he
was
before
,
*NL*
and
niver
get
better
again
as
he
's
getting
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
but
if
I
bought
the
mill
,
and
allowed
your
husband
to
act
as
my
*NL*
manager
in
the
same
way
,
how
then
?
''
said
Mr.
Wakem
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
sir
,
I
doubt
he
could
niver
be
got
to
do
it
,
not
if
the
very
mill
*NL*
stood
still
to
beg
and
pray
of
him
.
For
your
name
's
like
poison
to
*NL*
him
,
it
's
so
as
never
was
;
and
he
looks
upon
it
as
you
've
been
the
*NL*
ruin
of
him
all
along
,
ever
since
you
set
the
law
on
him
about
the
*NL*
road
through
the
meadow
,
--
that
's
eight
year
ago
,
and
he
's
been
going
*NL*
on
ever
since
--
as
I
've
allays
told
him
he
was
wrong

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
a
pig-headed
,
foul-mouthed
fool
!
''
burst
out
Mr.
Wakem
,
*NL*
forgetting
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
dear
,
sir
!
''
said
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
frightened
at
a
result
so
*NL*
different
from
the
one
she
had
fixed
her
mind
on
;
``
I
would
n't
wish
to
*NL*
contradict
you
,
but
it
's
like
enough
he
's
changed
his
mind
with
this
*NL*
illness
,
--
he
's
forgot
a
many
things
he
used
to
talk
about
.
And
you
*NL*
would
n't
like
to
have
a
corpse
on
your
mind
,
if
he
was
to
die
;
and
*NL*
they
_
do
_
say
as
it
's
allays
unlucky
when
Dorlcote
Mill
changes
hands
,
*NL*
and
the
water
might
all
run
away
,
and
_
then
_
--
not
as
I
'm
wishing
you
*NL*
any
ill-luck
,
sir
,
for
I
forgot
to
tell
you
as
I
remember
your
wedding
*NL*
as
if
it
was
yesterday
;
Mrs.
Wakem
was
a
Miss
Clint

I
know

that

*NL*
and
my
boy

as
there
is
n't
a
nicer
,
handsomer
,
straighter
boy
nowhere
,
*NL*
went
to
school
with
your
son
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Wakem
rose
,
opened
the
door
,
and
called
to
one
of
his
clerks
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
excuse
me
for
interrupting
you
,
Mrs.
Tulliver
;
I
have
*NL*
business
that
must
be
attended
to
;
and
I
think
there
is
nothing
more
*NL*
necessary
to
be
said
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
if
you
_
would
_
bear
it
in
mind
,
sir
,
''
said
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
rising
,
*NL*
``
and
not
run
against
me
and
my
children
;
and
I
'm
not
denying
Mr.
*NL*
Tulliver
's
been
in
the
wrong
,
but
he
's
been
punished
enough
,
and
*NL*
there
's
worse
men
,
for
it
's
been
giving
to
other
folks

been
his
*NL*
fault
.
He
's
done
nobody
any
harm
but
himself
and
his
family
,
--
the
*NL*
more
's
the
pity
,
--
and
I
go
and
look
at
the
bare
shelves
every
day
,
and
*NL*
think
where
all
my
things
used
to
stand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
I
'll
bear
it
in
mind
,
''
said
Mr.
Wakem
,
hastily
,
looking
*NL*
toward
the
open
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
if
you
'd
please
not
to
say
as
I
've
been
to
speak
to
you
,
for
my
*NL*
son

ud
be
very
angry
with
me
for
demeaning
myself
,
I
know
he
would
,
*NL*
and
I
've
trouble
enough
without
being
scolded
by
my
children
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Mrs.
Tulliver
's
voice
trembled
a
little
,
and
she
could
make
no
*NL*
answer
to
the
attorney
's
``
good
morning
,
''
but
curtsied
and
walked
out
*NL*
in
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Which
day
is
it
that
Dorlcote
Mill
is
to
be
sold
?
Where
's
the
bill
?
''
*NL*
said
Mr.
Wakem
to
his
clerk
when
they
were
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Next
Friday
is
the
day
,
--
Friday
at
six
o'clock
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
just
run
to
Winship
's
the
auctioneer
,
and
see
if
he
's
at
home
.
I
*NL*
have
some
business
for
him
;
ask
him
to
come
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Although
,
when
Mr.
Wakem
entered
his
office
that
morning
,
he
had
had
*NL*
no
intention
of
purchasing
Dorlcote
Mill
,
his
mind
was
already
made
*NL*
up
.
Mrs.
Tulliver
had
suggested
to
him
several
determining
motives
,
*NL*
and
his
mental
glance
was
very
rapid
;
he
was
one
of
those
men
who
can
*NL*
be
prompt
without
being
rash
,
because
their
motives
run
in
fixed
*NL*
tracks
,
and
they
have
no
need
to
reconcile
conflicting
aims
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
suppose
that
Wakem
had
the
same
sort
of
inveterate
hatred
toward
*NL*
Tulliver
that
Tulliver
had
toward
him
would
be
like
supposing
that
a
*NL*
pike
and
a
roach
can
look
at
each
other
from
a
similar
point
of
view
.
*NL*
The
roach
necessarily
abhors
the
mode
in
which
the
pike
gets
his
*NL*
living
,
and
the
pike
is
likely
to
think
nothing
further
even
of
the
*NL*
most
indignant
roach
than
that
he
is
excellent
good
eating
;
it
could
*NL*
only
be
when
the
roach
choked
him
that
the
pike
could
entertain
a
*NL*
strong
personal
animosity
.
If
Mr.
Tulliver
had
ever
seriously
injured
*NL*
or
thwarted
the
attorney
,
Wakem
would
not
have
refused
him
the
*NL*
distinction
of
being
a
special
object
of
his
vindictiveness
.
But
when
*NL*
Mr.
Tulliver
called
Wakem
a
rascal
at
the
market
dinner-table
,
the
*NL*
attorneys
'
clients
were
not
a
whit
inclined
to
withdraw
their
business
*NL*
from
him
;
and
if
,
when
Wakem
himself
happened
to
be
present
,
some
*NL*
jocose
cattle-feeder
,
stimulated
by
opportunity
and
brandy
,
made
a
*NL*
thrust
at
him
by
alluding
to
old
ladies
'
wills
,
he
maintained
perfect
*NL*
_
sang
froid
_
,
and
knew
quite
well
that
the
majority
of
substantial
men
*NL*
then
present
were
perfectly
contented
with
the
fact
that
``
Wakem
was
*NL*
Wakem
''
;
that
is
to
say
,
a
man
who
always
knew
the
stepping-stones
that
*NL*
would
carry
him
through
very
muddy
bits
of
practice
.
A
man
who
had
*NL*
made
a
large
fortune
,
had
a
handsome
house
among
the
trees
at
Tofton
,
*NL*
and
decidedly
the
finest
stock
of
port-wine
in
the
neighborhood
of
St.
*NL*
Ogg
's
,
was
likely
to
feel
himself
on
a
level
with
public
opinion
.
And
*NL*
I
am
not
sure
that
even
honest
Mr.
Tulliver
himself
,
with
his
general
*NL*
view
of
law
as
a
cockpit
,
might
not
,
under
opposite
circumstances
,
*NL*
have
seen
a
fine
appropriateness
in
the
truth
that
``
Wakem
was
Wakem
''
;
*NL*
since
I
have
understood
from
persons
versed
in
history
,
that
mankind
*NL*
is
not
disposed
to
look
narrowly
into
the
conduct
of
great
victors
*NL*
when
their
victory
is
on
the
right
side
.
Tulliver
,
then
,
could
be
no
*NL*
obstruction
to
Wakem
;
on
the
contrary
,
he
was
a
poor
devil
whom
the
*NL*
lawyer
had
defeated
several
times
;
a
hot-tempered
fellow
,
who
would
*NL*
always
give
you
a
handle
against
him
.
Wakem
's
conscience
was
not
*NL*
uneasy
because
he
had
used
a
few
tricks
against
the
miller
;
why
should
*NL*
he
hate
that
unsuccessful
plaintiff
,
that
pitiable
,
furious
bull
*NL*
entangled
in
the
meshes
of
a
net
?
*NL*
*NL*
Still
,
among
the
various
excesses
to
which
human
nature
is
subject
,
*NL*
moralists
have
never
numbered
that
of
being
too
fond
of
the
people
who
*NL*
openly
revile
us
.
The
successful
Yellow
candidate
for
the
borough
of
*NL*
Old
Topping
,
perhaps
,
feels
no
pursuant
meditative
hatred
toward
the
*NL*
Blue
editor
who
consoles
his
subscribers
with
vituperative
rhetoric
*NL*
against
Yellow
men
who
sell
their
country
,
and
are
the
demons
of
*NL*
private
life
;
but
he
might
not
be
sorry
,
if
law
and
opportunity
*NL*
favored
,
to
kick
that
Blue
editor
to
a
deeper
shade
of
his
favorite
*NL*
color
.
Prosperous
men
take
a
little
vengeance
now
and
then
,
as
they
*NL*
take
a
diversion
,
when
it
comes
easily
in
their
way
,
and
is
no
*NL*
hindrance
to
business
;
and
such
small
unimpassioned
revenges
have
an
*NL*
enormous
effect
in
life
,
running
through
all
degrees
of
pleasant
*NL*
infliction
,
blocking
the
fit
men
out
of
places
,
and
blackening
*NL*
characters
in
unpremeditated
talk
.
Still
more
,
to
see
people
who
have
*NL*
been
only
insignificantly
offensive
to
us
reduced
in
life
and
*NL*
humiliated
,
without
any
special
effort
of
ours
,
is
apt
to
have
a
*NL*
soothing
,
flattering
influence
.
Providence
or
some
other
prince
of
*NL*
this
world
,
it
appears
,
has
undertaken
the
task
of
retribution
for
us
;
*NL*
and
really
,
by
an
agreeable
constitution
of
things
,
our
enemies
*NL*
somehow
_
do
n't
_
prosper
.
*NL*
*NL*
Wakem
was
not
without
this
parenthetic
vindictiveness
toward
the
*NL*
uncomplimentary
miller
;
and
now
Mrs.
Tulliver
had
put
the
notion
into
*NL*
his
head
,
it
presented
itself
to
him
as
a
pleasure
to
do
the
very
*NL*
thing
that
would
cause
Mr.
Tulliver
the
most
deadly
mortification
,
--
*NL*
and
a
pleasure
of
a
complex
kind
,
not
made
up
of
crude
malice
,
but
*NL*
mingling
with
it
the
relish
of
self-approbation
.
To
see
an
enemy
*NL*
humiliated
gives
a
certain
contentment
,
but
this
is
jejune
compared
*NL*
with
the
highly
blent
satisfaction
of
seeing
him
humiliated
by
your
*NL*
benevolent
action
or
concession
on
his
behalf
.
That
is
a
sort
of
*NL*
revenge
which
falls
into
the
scale
of
virtue
,
and
Wakem
was
not
without
*NL*
an
intention
of
keeping
that
scale
respectably
filled
.
He
had
once
*NL*
had
the
pleasure
of
putting
an
old
enemy
of
his
into
one
of
the
St.
*NL*
Ogg
's
alms-houses
,
to
the
rebuilding
of
which
he
had
given
a
large
*NL*
subscription
;
and
here
was
an
opportunity
of
providing
for
another
by
*NL*
making
him
his
own
servant
.
Such
things
give
a
completeness
to
*NL*
prosperity
,
and
contribute
elements
of
agreeable
consciousness
that
*NL*
are
not
dreamed
of
by
that
short-sighted
,
overheated
vindictiveness
*NL*
which
goes
out
its
way
to
wreak
itself
in
direct
injury
.
And
Tulliver
,
*NL*
with
his
rough
tongue
filed
by
a
sense
of
obligation
,
would
make
a
*NL*
better
servant
than
any
chance-fellow
who
was
cap-in-hand
for
a
*NL*
situation
.
Tulliver
was
known
to
be
a
man
of
proud
honesty
,
and
Wakem
*NL*
was
too
acute
not
to
believe
in
the
existence
of
honesty
.
He
was
given
*NL*
too
observing
individuals
,
not
to
judging
of
them
according
to
maxims
,
*NL*
and
no
one
knew
better
than
he
that
all
men
were
not
like
himself
.
*NL*
Besides
,
he
intended
to
overlook
the
whole
business
of
land
and
mill
*NL*
pretty
closely
;
he
was
fond
of
these
practical
rural
matters
.
But
*NL*
there
were
good
reasons
for
purchasing
Dorlcote
Mill
,
quite
apart
from
*NL*
any
benevolent
vengeance
on
the
miller
.
It
was
really
a
capital
*NL*
investment
;
besides
,
Guest
&
Co.
were
going
to
bid
for
it
.
Mr.
Guest
*NL*
and
Mr.
Wakem
were
on
friendly
dining
terms
,
and
the
attorney
liked
to
*NL*
predominate
over
a
ship-owner
and
mill-owner
who
was
a
little
too
loud
*NL*
in
the
town
affairs
as
well
as
in
his
table-talk
.
For
Wakem
was
not
a
*NL*
mere
man
of
business
;
he
was
considered
a
pleasant
fellow
in
the
upper
*NL*
circles
of
St.
Ogg
's
--
chatted
amusingly
over
his
port-wine
,
did
a
*NL*
little
amateur
farming
,
and
had
certainly
been
an
excellent
husband
*NL*
and
father
;
at
church
,
when
he
went
there
,
he
sat
under
the
handsomest
*NL*
of
mural
monuments
erected
to
the
memory
of
his
wife
.
Most
men
would
*NL*
have
married
again
under
his
circumstances
,
but
he
was
said
to
be
more
*NL*
tender
to
his
deformed
son
than
most
men
were
to
their
best-shapen
*NL*
offspring
.
Not
that
Mr.
Wakem
had
not
other
sons
beside
Philip
;
but
*NL*
toward
them
he
held
only
a
chiaroscuro
parentage
,
and
provided
for
*NL*
them
in
a
grade
of
life
duly
beneath
his
own
.
In
this
fact
,
indeed
,
*NL*
there
lay
the
clenching
motive
to
the
purchase
of
Dorlcote
Mill
.
While
*NL*
Mrs.
Tulliver
was
talking
,
it
had
occurred
to
the
rapid-minded
lawyer
,
*NL*
among
all
the
other
circumstances
of
the
case
,
that
this
purchase
*NL*
would
,
in
a
few
years
to
come
,
furnish
a
highly
suitable
position
for
*NL*
a
certain
favorite
lad
whom
he
meant
to
bring
on
in
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
were
the
mental
conditions
on
which
Mrs.
Tulliver
had
undertaken
*NL*
to
act
persuasively
,
and
had
failed
;
a
fact
which
may
receive
some
*NL*
illustration
from
the
remark
of
a
great
philosopher
,
that
fly-fishers
*NL*
fail
in
preparing
their
bait
so
as
to
make
it
alluring
in
the
right
*NL*
quarter
,
for
want
of
a
due
acquaintance
with
the
subjectivity
of
*NL*
fishes
.

Chapter
VIII
*NL*
*NL*
Daylight
on
the
Wreck
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
clear
frosty
January
day
on
which
Mr.
Tulliver
first
came
*NL*
downstairs
.
The
bright
sun
on
the
chestnut
boughs
and
the
roofs
*NL*
opposite
his
window
had
made
him
impatiently
declare
that
he
would
be
*NL*
caged
up
no
longer
;
he
thought
everywhere
would
be
more
cheery
under
*NL*
this
sunshine
than
his
bedroom
;
for
he
knew
nothing
of
the
bareness
*NL*
below
,
which
made
the
flood
of
sunshine
importunate
,
as
if
it
had
an
*NL*
unfeeling
pleasure
in
showing
the
empty
places
,
and
the
marks
where
*NL*
well-known
objects
once
had
been
.
The
impression
on
his
mind
that
it
*NL*
was
but
yesterday
when
he
received
the
letter
from
Mr.
Gore
was
so
*NL*
continually
implied
in
his
talk
,
and
the
attempts
to
convey
to
him
the
*NL*
idea
that
many
weeks
had
passed
and
much
had
happened
since
then
had
*NL*
been
so
soon
swept
away
by
recurrent
forgetfulness
,
that
even
Mr.
*NL*
Turnbull
had
begun
to
despair
of
preparing
him
to
meet
the
facts
by
*NL*
previous
knowledge
.
The
full
sense
of
the
present
could
only
be
*NL*
imparted
gradually
by
new
experience
,
--
not
by
mere
words
,
which
must
*NL*
remain
weaker
than
the
impressions
left
by
the
_
old
_
experience
.
This
*NL*
resolution
to
come
downstairs
was
heard
with
trembling
by
the
wife
and
*NL*
children
.
Mrs.
Tulliver
said
Tom
must
not
go
to
St.
Ogg
's
at
the
usual
*NL*
hour
,
he
must
wait
and
see
his
father
downstairs
;
and
Tom
complied
,
*NL*
though
with
an
intense
inward
shrinking
from
the
painful
scene
.
The
*NL*
hearts
of
all
three
had
been
more
deeply
dejected
than
ever
during
the
*NL*
last
few
days
.
For
Guest
&
Co.
had
not
bought
the
mill
;
both
mill
and
*NL*
land
had
been
knocked
down
to
Wakem
,
who
had
been
over
the
premises
,
*NL*
and
had
laid
before
Mr.
Deane
and
Mr.
Glegg
,
in
Mrs.
Tulliver
's
*NL*
presence
,
his
willingness
to
employ
Mr.
Tulliver
,
in
case
of
his
*NL*
recovery
,
as
a
manager
of
the
business
.
This
proposition
had
*NL*
occasioned
much
family
debating
.
Uncles
and
aunts
were
almost
*NL*
unanimously
of
opinion
that
such
an
offer
ought
not
to
be
rejected
*NL*
when
there
was
nothing
in
the
way
but
a
feeling
in
Mr.
Tulliver
's
*NL*
mind
,
which
,
as
neither
aunts
nor
uncles
shared
it
,
was
regarded
as
*NL*
entirely
unreasonable
and
childish
,
--
indeed
,
as
a
transferring
toward
*NL*
Wakem
of
that
indignation
and
hatred
which
Mr.
Tulliver
ought
properly
*NL*
to
have
directed
against
himself
for
his
general
quarrelsomeness
,
and
*NL*
his
special
exhibition
of
it
in
going
to
law
.
Here
was
an
opportunity
*NL*
for
Mr.
Tulliver
to
provide
for
his
wife
and
daughter
without
any
*NL*
assistance
from
his
wife
's
relations
,
and
without
that
too
evident
*NL*
descent
into
pauperism
which
makes
it
annoying
to
respectable
people
*NL*
to
meet
the
degraded
member
of
the
family
by
the
wayside
.
Mr.
*NL*
Tulliver
,
Mrs.
Glegg
considered
,
must
be
made
to
feel
,
when
he
came
to
*NL*
his
right
mind
,
that
he
could
never
humble
himself
enough
;
for
_
that
_
*NL*
had
come
which
she
had
always
foreseen
would
come
of
his
insolence
in
*NL*
time
past
``
to
them
as
were
the
best
friends
he
'd
got
to
look
to
.
''
Mr
*NL*
Glegg
and
Mr.
Deane
were
less
stern
in
their
views
,
but
they
both
of
*NL*
them
thought
Tulliver
had
done
enough
harm
by
his
hot-tempered
*NL*
crotchets
and
ought
to
put
them
out
of
the
question
when
a
livelihood
*NL*
was
offered
him
;
Wakem
showed
a
right
feeling
about
the
matter
,
--
_
he
_
*NL*
had
no
grudge
against
Tulliver
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
had
protested
against
entertaining
the
proposition
.
He
should
n't
*NL*
like
his
father
to
be
under
Wakem
;
he
thought
it
would
look
*NL*
mean-spirited
;
but
his
mother
's
main
distress
was
the
utter
*NL*
impossibility
of
ever
``
turning
Mr.
Tulliver
round
about
Wakem
,
''
or
*NL*
getting
him
to
hear
reason
;
no
,
they
would
all
have
to
go
and
live
in
*NL*
a
pigsty
on
purpose
to
spite
Wakem
,
who
spoke
``
so
as
nobody
could
be
*NL*
fairer
.
''
Indeed
,
Mrs.
Tulliver
's
mind
was
reduced
to
such
confusion
by
*NL*
living
in
this
strange
medium
of
unaccountable
sorrow
,
against
which
*NL*
she
continually
appealed
by
asking
,
``
Oh
dear
,
what
_
have
_
I
done
to
*NL*
deserve
worse
than
other
women
?
''
that
Maggie
began
to
suspect
her
poor
*NL*
mother
's
wits
were
quite
going
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tom
,
''
she
said
,
when
they
were
out
of
their
father
's
room
together
,
*NL*
``
we
_
must
_
try
to
make
father
understand
a
little
of
what
has
happened
*NL*
before
he
goes
downstairs
.
But
we
must
get
my
mother
away
.
She
will
*NL*
say
something
that
will
do
harm
.
Ask
Kezia
to
fetch
her
down
,
and
keep
*NL*
her
engaged
with
something
in
the
kitchen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Kezia
was
equal
to
the
task
.
Having
declared
her
intention
of
staying
*NL*
till
the
master
could
get
about
again
,
``
wage
or
no
wage
,
''
she
had
*NL*
found
a
certain
recompense
in
keeping
a
strong
hand
over
her
mistress
,
*NL*
scolding
her
for
``
moithering
''
herself
,
and
going
about
all
day
without
*NL*
changing
her
cap
,
and
looking
as
if
she
was
``
mushed
.
''
Altogether
,
this
*NL*
time
of
trouble
was
rather
a
Saturnalian
time
to
Kezia
;
she
could
*NL*
scold
her
betters
with
unreproved
freedom
.
On
this
particular
occasion
*NL*
there
were
drying
clothes
to
be
fetched
in
;
she
wished
to
know
if
one
*NL*
pair
of
hands
could
do
everything
in-doors
and
out
,
and
observed
that
*NL*
_
she
_
should
have
thought
it
would
be
good
for
Mrs.
Tulliver
to
put
on
*NL*
her
bonnet
,
and
get
a
breath
of
fresh
air
by
doing
that
needful
piece
*NL*
of
work
.
Poor
Mrs.
Tulliver
went
submissively
downstairs
;
to
be
*NL*
ordered
about
by
a
servant
was
the
last
remnant
of
her
household
*NL*
dignities
,
--
she
would
soon
have
no
servant
to
scold
her
.
Mr.
Tulliver
*NL*
was
resting
in
his
chair
a
little
after
the
fatigue
of
dressing
,
and
*NL*
Maggie
and
Tom
were
seated
near
him
,
when
Luke
entered
to
ask
if
he
*NL*
should
help
master
downstairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
ay
,
Luke
;
stop
a
bit
,
sit
down
,
''
said
Mr.
Tulliver
pointing
his
*NL*
stick
toward
a
chair
,
and
looking
at
him
with
that
pursuant
gaze
which
*NL*
convalescent
persons
often
have
for
those
who
have
tended
them
,
*NL*
reminding
one
of
an
infant
gazing
about
after
its
nurse
.
For
Luke
had
*NL*
been
a
constant
night-watcher
by
his
master
's
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
's
the
water
now
,
eh
,
Luke
?
''
said
Mr.
Tulliver
.
``
Dix
has
n't
been
*NL*
choking
you
up
again
,
eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
,
it
's
all
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
I
thought
not
;
he
wo
n't
be
in
a
hurry
at
that
again
,
now
Riley
's
*NL*
been
to
settle
him
.
That
was
what
I
said
to
Riley
yesterday
--
I
*NL*
said
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Tulliver
leaned
forward
,
resting
his
elbows
on
the
armchair
,
and
*NL*
looking
on
the
ground
as
if
in
search
of
something
,
striving
after
*NL*
vanishing
images
like
a
man
struggling
against
a
doze
.
Maggie
looked
*NL*
at
Tom
in
mute
distress
,
their
father
's
mind
was
so
far
off
the
*NL*
present
,
which
would
by-and-by
thrust
itself
on
his
wandering
*NL*
consciousness
!
Tom
was
almost
ready
to
rush
away
,
with
that
impatience
*NL*
of
painful
emotion
which
makes
one
of
the
differences
between
youth
*NL*
and
maiden
,
man
and
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Father
,
''
said
Maggie
,
laying
her
hand
on
his
,
``
do
n't
you
remember
*NL*
that
Mr.
Riley
is
dead
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dead
?
''
said
Mr.
Tulliver
,
sharply
,
looking
in
her
face
with
a
*NL*
strange
,
examining
glance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
he
died
of
apoplexy
nearly
a
year
ago
.
I
remember
hearing
you
*NL*
say
you
had
to
pay
money
for
him
;
and
he
left
his
daughters
badly
off
;
*NL*
one
of
them
is
under-teacher
at
Miss
Firniss
's
,
where
I
've
been
to
*NL*
school
,
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
?
''
said
her
father
,
doubtfully
,
still
looking
in
her
face
.
But
as
*NL*
soon
as
Tom
began
to
speak
he
turned
to
look
at
_
him
_
with
the
same
*NL*
inquiring
glances
,
as
if
he
were
rather
surprised
at
the
presence
of
*NL*
these
two
young
people
.
Whenever
his
mind
was
wandering
in
the
far
*NL*
past
,
he
fell
into
this
oblivion
of
their
actual
faces
;
they
were
not
*NL*
those
of
the
lad
and
the
little
wench
who
belonged
to
that
past
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
long
while
since
you
had
the
dispute
with
Dix
,
father
,
''
said
*NL*
Tom
.
``
I
remember
your
talking
about
it
three
years
ago
,
before
I
went
*NL*
to
school
at
Mr.
Stelling
's
.
I
've
been
at
school
there
three
years
;
*NL*
do
n't
you
remember
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Tulliver
threw
himself
backward
again
,
losing
the
childlike
*NL*
outward
glance
under
a
rush
of
new
ideas
,
which
diverted
him
from
*NL*
external
impressions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
ay
,
''
he
said
,
after
a
minute
or
two
,
``
I
've
paid
a
deal
o
'
*NL*
money
--
I
was
determined
my
son
should
have
a
good
eddication
;
I
'd
none
*NL*
myself
,
and
I
've
felt
the
miss
of
it
.
And
he
'll
want
no
other
fortin
,
*NL*
that
's
what
I
say
--
if
Wakem
was
to
get
the
better
of
me
again
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
thought
of
Wakem
roused
new
vibrations
,
and
after
a
moment
's
pause
*NL*
he
began
to
look
at
the
coat
he
had
on
,
and
to
feel
in
his
*NL*
side-pocket
.
Then
he
turned
to
Tom
,
and
said
in
his
old
sharp
way
,
*NL*
``
Where
have
they
put
Gore
's
letter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
close
at
hand
in
a
drawer
,
for
he
had
often
asked
for
it
*NL*
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
what
there
is
in
the
letter
,
father
?
''
said
Tom
,
as
he
gave
*NL*
it
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
be
sure
I
do
,
''
said
Mr.
Tulliver
,
rather
angrily
.
``
What
o
'
that
?
*NL*
If
Furley
ca
n't
take
to
the
property
,
somebody
else
can
;
there
's
*NL*
plenty
o

people
in
the
world
besides
Furley
.
But
it
's
hindering
--
my
*NL*
not
being
well
--
go
and
tell
'em
to
get
the
horse
in
the
gig
,
Luke
;
I
*NL*
can
get
down
to
St.
Ogg

well
enough

Gore
's
expecting
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
dear
father
!
''
Maggie
burst
out
entreatingly
;
``
it
's
a
very
long
*NL*
while
since
all
that
;
you
've
been
ill
a
great
many
weeks
,
--
more
than
*NL*
two
months
;
everything
is
changed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Tulliver
looked
at
them
all
three
alternately
with
a
startled
*NL*
gaze
;
the
idea
that
much
had
happened
of
which
he
knew
nothing
had
*NL*
often
transiently
arrested
him
before
,
but
it
came
upon
him
now
with
*NL*
entire
novelty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
father
,
''
said
Tom
,
in
answer
to
the
gaze
.
``
You
need
n't
trouble
*NL*
your
mind
about
business
until
you
are
quite
well
;
everything
is
*NL*
settled
about
that
for
the
present
,

about
the
mill
and
the
land
and
*NL*
the
debts
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
settled
,
then
?
''
said
his
father
,
angrily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
take
on
too
much
bout
it
,
sir
,
''
said
Luke
.
``
You
'd
ha

paid
*NL*
iverybody
if
you
could

that
's
what
I
said
to
Master
Tom
,
--
I
said
*NL*
you
'd
ha
'
paid
iverybody
if
you
could

''
*NL*
*NL*
Good
Luke
felt
,
after
the
manner
of
contented
hard-working
men
whose
*NL*
lives
have
been
spent
in
servitude
,
that
sense
of
natural
fitness
in
*NL*
rank
which
made
his
master
's
downfall
a
tragedy
to
him
.
He
was
urged
,
*NL*
in
his
slow
way
,
to
say
something
that
would
express
his
share
in
the
*NL*
family
sorrow
;
and
these
words
,
which
he
had
used
over
and
over
again
*NL*
to
Tom
when
he
wanted
to
decline
the
full
payment
of
his
fifty
pounds
*NL*
out
of
the
children
's
money
,
were
the
most
ready
to
his
tongue
.
They
*NL*
were
just
the
words
to
lay
the
most
painful
hold
on
his
master
's
*NL*
bewildered
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Paid
everybody
?
''
he
said
,
with
vehement
agitation
,
his
face
flushing
,
*NL*
and
his
eye
lighting
up
.
``
Why
--
what
--
have
they
made
me
a
_
bankrupt
?
_
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
father
,
dear
father
!
''
said
Maggie
,
who
thought
that
terrible
word
*NL*
really
represented
the
fact
;
``
bear
it
well
,
because
we
love
you
;
your
*NL*
children
will
always
love
you
.
Tom
will
pay
them
all
;
he
says
he
will
,
*NL*
when
he
's
a
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
felt
her
father
beginning
to
tremble
;
his
voice
trembled
too
,
as
*NL*
he
said
,
after
a
few
moments
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
my
little
wench
,
but
I
shall
never
live
twice
o'er
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
perhaps
you
will
live
to
see
me
pay
everybody
,
father
,
''
said
Tom
,
*NL*
speaking
with
a
great
effort
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
my
lad
,
''
said
Mr.
Tulliver
,
shaking
his
head
slowly
,
``
but
what
's
*NL*
broke
can
never
be
whole
again
;
it
`
ud
be
your
doing
,
not
mine
.
''
Then
*NL*
looking
up
at
him
,
``
You
're
only
sixteen
;
it
's
an
up-hill
fight
for
*NL*
you
,
but
you
must
n't
throw
it
at
your
father
;
the
raskills
have
been
*NL*
too
many
for
him
.
I
've
given
you
a
good
eddication
,
--
that
'll
start
*NL*
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Something
in
his
throat
half
choked
the
last
words
;
the
flush
,
which
*NL*
had
alarmed
his
children
because
it
had
so
often
preceded
a
recurrence
*NL*
of
paralysis
,
had
subsided
,
and
his
face
looked
pale
and
tremulous
.
*NL*
Tom
said
nothing
;
he
was
still
struggling
against
his
inclination
to
*NL*
rush
away
.
His
father
remained
quiet
a
minute
or
two
,
but
his
mind
did
*NL*
not
seem
to
be
wandering
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
they
sold
me
up
,
then
?
''
he
said
more
calmly
,
as
if
he
were
*NL*
possessed
simply
by
the
desire
to
know
what
had
happened
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Everything
is
sold
,
father
;
but
we
do
n't
know
all
about
the
mill
and
*NL*
the
land
yet
,
''
said
Tom
,
anxious
to
ward
off
any
question
leading
to
*NL*
the
fact
that
Wakem
was
the
purchaser
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
not
be
surprised
to
see
the
room
look
very
bare
downstairs
,
*NL*
father
,
''
said
Maggie
;
``
but
there
's
your
chair
and
the
bureau
;
*NL*
_
they
're
_
not
gone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
go
;
help
me
down
,
Luke
,
--
I
'll
go
and
see
everything
,
''
said
Mr.
*NL*
Tulliver
,
leaning
on
his
stick
,
and
stretching
out
his
other
hand
*NL*
toward
Luke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
sir
,
''
said
Luke
,
as
he
gave
his
arm
to
his
master
,
``
you
'll
make
*NL*
up
your
mind
to
'
t
a
bit
better
when
you
've
seen
iverything
;
you
'll
get
*NL*
used
to
`
t.
That
's
what
my
mother
says
about
her
shortness
o
'
*NL*
breath
,
--
she
says
she
's
made
friends
wi
'
t
now
,
though
she
fought
*NL*
again
'
it
sore
when
it
just
come
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
ran
on
before
to
see
that
all
was
right
in
the
dreary
parlor
,
*NL*
where
the
fire
,
dulled
by
the
frosty
sunshine
,
seemed
part
of
the
*NL*
general
shabbiness
.
She
turned
her
father
's
chair
,
and
pushed
aside
*NL*
the
table
to
make
an
easy
way
for
him
,
and
then
stood
with
a
beating
*NL*
heart
to
see
him
enter
and
look
round
for
the
first
time
.
Tom
advanced
*NL*
before
him
,
carrying
the
leg-rest
,
and
stood
beside
Maggie
on
the
*NL*
hearth
.
Of
those
two
young
hearts
Tom
's
suffered
the
most
unmixed
*NL*
pain
,
for
Maggie
,
with
all
her
keen
susceptibility
,
yet
felt
as
if
the
*NL*
sorrow
made
larger
room
for
her
love
to
flow
in
,
and
gave
*NL*
breathing-space
to
her
passionate
nature
.
No
true
boy
feels
that
;
he
*NL*
would
rather
go
and
slay
the
Nemean
lion
,
or
perform
any
round
of
*NL*
heroic
labors
,
than
endure
perpetual
appeals
to
his
pity
,
for
evils
*NL*
over
which
he
can
make
no
conquest
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Tulliver
paused
just
inside
the
door
,
resting
on
Luke
,
and
looking
*NL*
round
him
at
all
the
bare
places
,
which
for
him
were
filled
with
the
*NL*
shadows
of
departed
objects
,
--
the
daily
companions
of
his
life
.
His
*NL*
faculties
seemed
to
be
renewing
their
strength
from
getting
a
footing
*NL*
on
this
demonstration
of
the
senses
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
he
said
slowly
,
moving
toward
his
chair
,
``
they
've
sold
me
*NL*
up
--
they
've
sold
me
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
seating
himself
,
and
laying
down
his
stick
,
while
Luke
left
the
*NL*
room
,
he
looked
round
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
've
left
the
big
Bible
,
''
he
said
.
``
It
's
got
everything
in
,
--
when
*NL*
I
was
born
and
married
;
bring
it
me
,
Tom
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
quarto
Bible
was
laid
open
before
him
at
the
fly-leaf
,
and
while
*NL*
he
was
reading
with
slowly
travelling
eyes
Mrs.
Tulliver
entered
the
*NL*
room
,
but
stood
in
mute
surprise
to
find
her
husband
down
already
,
and
*NL*
with
the
great
Bible
before
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
he
said
,
looking
at
a
spot
where
his
finger
rested
,
``
my
mother
*NL*
was
Margaret
Beaton
;
she
died
when
she
was
forty-seven

hers
was

*NL*
long-lived

shall
go
to
our
last
bed
before
long

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
seemed
to
be
pausing
over
the
record
of
his
sister
's
birth
and
*NL*
marriage
,
as
if
it
were
suggesting
new
thoughts
to
him
;
then
he
*NL*
suddenly
looked
up
at
Tom
,
and
said
,
in
a
sharp
tone
of
alarm
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
have
n't
come
upo

Moss
for
the
money
as
I
lent
him
,
have
they
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

,
''
said
Tom
;
``
the
note
was
burnt

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Tulliver
turned
his
eyes
on
the
page
again
,
and
presently
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

Elizabeth
Dodson
--
it
's
eighteen
year
since
I
married
her

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come

''
said
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
going
up
to
his
side
and
*NL*
looking
at
the
page
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
husband
fixed
his
eyes
earnestly
on
her
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
Bessy
,
''
he
said
,
``
you

*NL*
``

said
poor
Mrs.
*NL*
Tulliver
,
with
the
strange
,
scared
look
that
had
come
over
her
of
*NL*
late
;
``

my
poor

``

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do

said
Mr.
Tulliver
,
whose
pride
,
in
these
first
*NL*
moments
of
humiliation
,
was
in
abeyance
to
the
sense
of
some
justice
*NL*
in
his
wife
's
reproach
.
``

there

severely

trembling

Chapter
IX
*NL*
*NL*
An
Item
Added
to
the
Family
Register
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
That
first
moment
of
renunciation
and
submission
was
followed
by
days
*NL*
of
violent
struggle
in
the
miller
's
mind
,
as
the
gradual
access
of
*NL*
bodily
strength
brought
with
it
increasing
ability
to
embrace
in
one
*NL*
view
all
the
conflicting
conditions
under
which
he
found
himself
.
*NL*
Feeble
limbs
easily
resign
themselves
to
be
tethered
,
and
when
we
are
*NL*
subdued
by
sickness
it
seems
possible
to
us
to
fulfil
pledges
which
*NL*
the
old
vigor
comes
back
and
breaks
.
There
were
times
when
poor
*NL*
Tulliver
thought
the
fulfilment
of
his
promise
to
Bessy
was
something
*NL*
quite
too
hard
for
human
nature
;
he
had
promised
her
without
knowing
*NL*
what
she
was
going
to
say
,
--
she
might
as
well
have
asked
him
to
carry
*NL*
a
ton
weight
on
his
back
.
But
again
,
there
were
many
feelings
arguing
*NL*
on
her
side
,
besides
the
sense
that
life
had
been
made
hard
to
her
by
*NL*
having
married
him
.
He
saw
a
possibility
,
by
much
pinching
,
of
saving
*NL*
money
out
of
his
salary
toward
paying
a
second
dividend
to
his
*NL*
creditors
,
and
it
would
not
be
easy
elsewhere
to
get
a
situation
such
*NL*
as
he
could
fill
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
led
an
easy
life
,
ordering
much
and
working
little
,
and
had
no
*NL*
aptitude
for
any
new
business
.
He
must
perhaps
take
to
day-labor
,
and
*NL*
his
wife
must
have
help
from
her
sisters
,
--
a
prospect
doubly
bitter
to
*NL*
him
,
now
they
had
let
all
Bessy
's
precious
things
be
sold
,
probably
*NL*
because
they
liked
to
set
her
against
him
,
by
making
her
feel
that
he
*NL*
had
brought
her
to
that
pass
.
He
listened
to
their
admonitory
talk
,
*NL*
when
they
came
to
urge
on
him
what
he
was
bound
to
do
for
poor
Bessy
's
*NL*
sake
,
with
averted
eyes
,
that
every
now
and
then
flashed
on
them
*NL*
furtively
when
their
backs
were
turned
.
Nothing
but
the
dread
of
*NL*
needing
their
help
could
have
made
it
an
easier
alternative
to
take
*NL*
their
advice
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
strongest
influence
of
all
was
the
love
of
the
old
premises
*NL*
where
he
had
run
about
when
he
was
a
boy
,
just
as
Tom
had
done
after
*NL*
him
.
The
Tullivers
had
lived
on
this
spot
for
generations
,
and
he
had
*NL*
sat
listening
on
a
low
stool
on
winter
evenings
while
his
father
*NL*
talked
of
the
old
half-timbered
mill
that
had
been
there
before
the
*NL*
last
great
floods
which
damaged
it
so
that
his
grandfather
pulled
it
*NL*
down
and
built
the
new
one
.
It
was
when
he
got
able
to
walk
about
and
*NL*
look
at
all
the
old
objects
that
he
felt
the
strain
of
his
clinging
*NL*
affection
for
the
old
home
as
part
of
his
life
,
part
of
himself
.
He
*NL*
could
n't
bear
to
think
of
himself
living
on
any
other
spot
than
this
,
*NL*
where
he
knew
the
sound
of
every
gate
door
,
and
felt
that
the
shape
*NL*
and
color
of
every
roof
and
weather-stain
and
broken
hillock
was
good
,
*NL*
because
his
growing
senses
had
been
fed
on
them
.
Our
instructed
*NL*
vagrancy
,
which
was
hardly
time
to
linger
by
the
hedgerows
,
but
runs
*NL*
away
early
to
the
tropics
,
and
is
at
home
with
palms
and
*NL*
banyans
,
--
which
is
nourished
on
books
of
travel
and
stretches
the
*NL*
theatre
of
its
imagination
to
the
Zambesi
,
--
can
hardly
get
a
dim
*NL*
notion
of
what
an
old-fashioned
man
like
Tulliver
felt
for
this
spot
,
*NL*
where
all
his
memories
centred
,
and
where
life
seemed
like
a
familiar
*NL*
smooth-handled
tool
that
the
fingers
clutch
with
loving
ease
.
And
just
*NL*
now
he
was
living
in
that
freshened
memory
of
the
far-off
time
which
*NL*
comes
to
us
in
the
passive
hours
of
recovery
from
sickness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
Luke
,
''
he
said
one
afternoon
,
as
he
stood
looking
over
the
*NL*
orchard
gate
,
``
I
remember
the
day
they
planted
those
apple-trees
.
My
*NL*
father
was
a
huge
man
for
planting
,
--
it
was
like
a
merry-making
to
him
*NL*
to
get
a
cart
full
o
'
young
trees
;
and
I
used
to
stand
i
'
the
cold
*NL*
with
him
,
and
follow
him
about
like
a
dog
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
turned
round
,
and
leaning
against
the
gate-post
,
looked
at
the
*NL*
opposite
buildings
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
old
mill
`
ud
miss
me
,
I
think
,
Luke
.
There
's
a
story
as
when
the
*NL*
mill
changes
hands
,
the
river
's
angry
;
I
've
heard
my
father
say
it
*NL*
many
a
time
.
There
's
no
telling
whether
there
may
n't
be
summat
_
in
_
*NL*
the
story
,
for
this
is
a
puzzling
world
,
and
Old
Harry
's
got
a
finger
*NL*
in
it
--
it
's
been
too
many
for
me
,
I
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
sir
,
''
said
Luke
,
with
soothing
sympathy
,
``
what
wi
'
the
rust
on
*NL*
the
wheat
,
an
'
the
firin
'
o
'
the
ricks
an
'
that
,
as
I
've
seen
i

my
*NL*
time
,

things
often
looks
comical
;
there
's
the
bacon
fat
wi

our
last
*NL*
pig
run
away
like
butter

it
leaves
nought
but

.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
just
as
if
it
was
yesterday
,
now
,
''
Mr.
Tulliver
went
on
,
``
when
*NL*
my
father
began
the
malting
.
I
remember
,
the
day
they
finished
the
*NL*
malt-house
,
I
thought
summat
great
was
to
come
of
it
;
for
we
'd
a
*NL*
plum-pudding
that
day
and
a
bit
of
a
feast
,
and
I
said
to
my
*NL*
mother
,
--
she
was
a
fine
dark-eyed
woman
,
my
mother
was
,
--
the
little
*NL*
wench
`
ull
be
as
like
her
as
two
peas
.
''
Here
Mr.
Tulliver
put
his
*NL*
stick
between
his
legs
,
and
took
out
his
snuff-box
,
for
the
greater
*NL*
enjoyment
of
this
anecdote
,
which
dropped
from
him
in
fragments
,
as
if
*NL*
he
every
other
moment
lost
narration
in
vision
.
``
I
was
a
little
chap
*NL*
no
higher
much
than
my
mother
's
knee
,
--
she
was
sore
fond
of
us
*NL*
children
,
Gritty
and
me
,
--
and
so
I
said
to
her
,
`
Mother
,
'
I
said
,
*NL*
`
shall
we
have
plum-pudding
_
every
_
day
because
o
'
the
malt-house
?
She
*NL*
used
to
tell
me
o

that
till
her
dying
day
.
She
was
but
a
young
woman
*NL*
when
she
died
,
my
mother
was
.
But
it
's
forty
good
year
since
they
*NL*
finished
the
malt-house
,
and
it
is
n't
many
days
out
of
'em
all
as
I
*NL*
have
n't
looked
out
into
the

the
first
thing
in
the
*NL*
morning
,

all
weathers
,
from
year
's
end

year

I
should
go
off
*NL*
my
head
in
a
new
place

I
should
be
like
as

I
'd
lost
my

It

*NL*
all
hard

whichever
way
I
look
at
it
,

the
harness

gall

,

*NL*
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay

said
Luke
,
``
you

*NL*
*NL*
``

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
walk
was
finished
in
silence
after
this
,
for
Luke
had
disburthened
*NL*
himself
of
thoughts
to
an
extent
that
left
his
conversational
*NL*
resources
quite
barren
,
and
Mr.
Tulliver
had
relapsed
from
his
*NL*
recollections
into
a
painful
meditation
on
the
choice
of
hardships
*NL*
before
him
.
Maggie
noticed
that
he
was
unusually
absent
that
evening
*NL*
at
tea
;
and
afterward
he
sat
leaning
forward
in
his
chair
,
looking
at
*NL*
the
ground
,
moving
his
lips
,
and
shaking
his
head
from
time
to
time
.
*NL*
Then
he
looked
hard
at
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
who
was
knitting
opposite
him
,
*NL*
then
at
Maggie
,
who
,
as
she
bent
over
her
sewing
,
was
intensely
*NL*
conscious
of
some
drama
going
forward
in
her
father
's
mind
.
Suddenly
*NL*
he
took
up
the
poker
and
broke
the
large
coal
fiercely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
heart
,
Mr.
Tulliver
,
what
can
you
be
thinking
of
?
''
said
his
*NL*
wife
,
looking
up
in
alarm
;
``
it
's
very
wasteful
,
breaking
the
coal
,
and
*NL*
we
've
got
hardly
any
large
coal
left
,
and
I
do
n't
know
where
the
rest
*NL*
is
to
come
from
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
you
're
quite
so
well
to-night
,
are
you
,
father
?
''
said
*NL*
Maggie
;
``
you
seem
uneasy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
how
is
it
Tom
does
n't
come
?
''
said
Mr.
Tulliver
,
impatiently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
heart
,
is
it
time
?
I
must
go
and
get
his
supper
,
''
said
Mrs.
*NL*
Tulliver
,
laying
down
her
knitting
,
and
leaving
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
nigh
upon
half-past
eight
,
''
said
Mr.
Tulliver
.
``
He
'll
be
here
*NL*
soon
.
Go
,
go
and
get
the
big
Bible
,
and
open
it
at
the
beginning
,
*NL*
where
everything
's
set
down
.
And
get
the
pen
and
ink
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
obeyed
,
wondering
;
but
her
father
gave
no
further
orders
,
and
*NL*
only
sat
listening
for
Tom
's
footfall
on
the
gravel
,
apparently
*NL*
irritated
by
the
wind
,
which
had
risen
,
and
was
roaring
so
as
to
drown
*NL*
all
other
sounds
.
There
was
a
strange
light
in
his
eyes
that
rather
*NL*
frightened
Maggie
;
_
she
_
began
to
wish
that
Tom
would
come
,
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
he
is
,
then
,
''
said
Mr.
Tulliver
,
in
an
excited
way
,
when
the
*NL*
knock
came
at
last
.
Maggie
went
to
open
the
door
,
but
her
mother
came
*NL*
out
of
the
kitchen
hurriedly
,
saying
,
``
Stop
a
bit
,
Maggie
;
I
'll
open
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Tulliver
had
begun
to
be
a
little
frightened
at
her
boy
,
but
she
*NL*
was
jealous
of
every
office
others
did
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
supper
's
ready
by
the
kitchen-fire
,
my
boy
,
''
she
said
,
as
he
*NL*
took
off
his
hat
and
coat
.
``
You
shall
have
it
by
yourself
,
just
as
you
*NL*
like

and
I
wo
n't
speak
to
you

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
my
father
wants
Tom
,
mother
,
''
said
Maggie
;
``
he
must
come
into
*NL*
the
parlor
first
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
entered
with
his
usual
saddened
evening
face
,
but
his
eyes
fell
*NL*
immediately
on
the
open
Bible
and
the
inkstand
,
and
he
glanced
with
a
*NL*
look
of
anxious
surprise
at
his
father
,
who
was
saying
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
come
,
you
're
late
;
I
want
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
there
anything
the
matter

said
Tom
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
sit
down
,
all
of
you

said
Mr.
Tulliver
,
peremptorily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And

Tom

sit
down
here

something
for

Bible

''
*NL*
*NL*
They
all
three
sat
down
,
looking
at
him
.
He
began
to
speak
slowly
,
*NL*
looking
first
at
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I

made
up

grave
made
for

lie
down
in

we
must

be
bearing
one
another
ill-will

I
'll
stop
in
the
old
place
,

I
'll
*NL*
serve
under
Wakem

I
'll
serve
him
like

here
his
voice
*NL*
rose
,
--
``
they
'll
have
it
to
throw
up
against

I
paid
a
dividend

but
it
was

my
fault

it
was
because
there
's
raskills
in
the
world

*NL*
They

been

many

*NL*
He
paused
and
looked
on
the
ground
.
Then
suddenly
raising
his
head
,
he
*NL*
said
,
in
a
louder
yet
deeper
tone
:
*NL*
*NL*
``

I
wo

the

Old

props
up

rascals

He

been
at

*NL*
bottom
of
everything

he

who
made
it
so

no

no
justice

It
signifies
nothing

I

he

one

fine

business

Maggie

sinking
down
by

along

scared

A
Variation

Unknown

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Journeying
down
the
Rhone
on
a
summer
's
day
,
you
have
perhaps
felt
the
*NL*
sunshine
made
dreary
by
those
ruined
villages
which
stud
the
banks
in
*NL*
certain
parts
of
its
course
,
telling
how
the
swift
river
once
rose
,
*NL*
like
an
angry
,
destroying
god
,
sweeping
down
the
feeble
generations
*NL*
whose
breath
is
in
their
nostrils
,
and
making
their
dwellings
a
*NL*
desolation
.
Strange
contrast
,
you
may
have
thought
,
between
the
*NL*
effect
produced
on
us
by
these
dismal
remnants
of
commonplace
*NL*
houses
,
which
in
their
best
days
were
but
the
sign
of
a
sordid
life
,
*NL*
belonging
in
all
its
details
to
our
own
vulgar
era
,
and
the
effect
*NL*
produced
by
those
ruins
on
the
castled
Rhine
,
which
have
crumbled
and
*NL*
mellowed
into
such
harmony
with
the
green
and
rocky
steeps
that
they
*NL*
seem
to
have
a
natural
fitness
,
like
the
mountain-pine
;
nay
,
even
in
*NL*
the
day
when
they
were
built
they
must
have
had
this
fitness
,
as
if
*NL*
they
had
been
raised
by
an
earth-born
race
,
who
had
inherited
from
*NL*
their
mighty
parent
a
sublime
instinct
of
form
.
And
that
was
a
day
of
*NL*
romance
;
If
those
robber-barons
were
somewhat
grim
and
drunken
ogres
,
*NL*
they
had
a
certain
grandeur
of
the
wild
beast
in
them
,
--
they
were
*NL*
forest
boars
with
tusks
,
tearing
and
rending
,
not
the
ordinary
*NL*
domestic
grunter
;
they
represented
the
demon
forces
forever
in
*NL*
collision
with
beauty
,
virtue
,
and
the
gentle
uses
of
life
;
they
made
*NL*
a
fine
contrast
in
the
picture
with
the
wandering
minstrel
,
the
*NL*
soft-lipped
princess
,
the
pious
recluse
,
and
the
timid
Israelite
.
That
*NL*
was
a
time
of
color
,
when
the
sunlight
fell
on
glancing
steel
and
*NL*
floating
banners
;
a
time
of
adventure
and
fierce
struggle
,
--
nay
,
of
*NL*
living
,
religious
art
and
religious
enthusiasm
;
for
were
not
*NL*
cathedrals
built
in
those
days
,
and
did
not
great
emperors
leave
their
*NL*
Western
palaces
to
die
before
the
infidel
strongholds
in
the
sacred
*NL*
East
?
Therefore
it
is
that
these
Rhine
castles
thrill
me
with
a
sense
*NL*
of
poetry
;
they
belong
to
the
grand
historic
life
of
humanity
,
and
*NL*
raise
up
for
me
the
vision
of
an
echo
.
But
these
dead-tinted
,
*NL*
hollow-eyed
,
angular
skeletons
of
villages
on
the
Rhone
oppress
me
*NL*
with
the
feeling
that
human
life
--
very
much
of
it
--
is
a
narrow
,
ugly
,
*NL*
grovelling
existence
,
which
even
calamity
does
not
elevate
,
but
rather
*NL*
tends
to
exhibit
in
all
its
bare
vulgarity
of
conception
;
and
I
have
a
*NL*
cruel
conviction
that
the
lives
these
ruins
are
the
traces
of
were
*NL*
part
of
a
gross
sum
of
obscure
vitality
,
that
will
be
swept
into
the
*NL*
same
oblivion
with
the
generations
of
ants
and
beavers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Perhaps
something
akin
to
this
oppressive
feeling
may
have
weighed
*NL*
upon
you
in
watching
this
old-fashioned
family
life
on
the
banks
of
*NL*
the
Floss
,
which
even
sorrow
hardly
suffices
to
lift
above
the
level
*NL*
of
the
tragi-comic
.
It
is
a
sordid
life
,
you
say
,
this
of
the
*NL*
Tullivers
and
Dodsons
,
irradiated
by
no
sublime
principles
,
no
*NL*
romantic
visions
,
no
active
,
self-renouncing
faith
;
moved
by
none
of
*NL*
those
wild
,
uncontrollable
passions
which
create
the
dark
shadows
of
*NL*
misery
and
crime
;
without
that
primitive
,
rough
simplicity
of
wants
,
*NL*
that
hard
,
submissive
,
ill-paid
toil
,
that
childlike
spelling-out
of
*NL*
what
nature
has
written
,
which
gives
its
poetry
to
peasant
life
.
Here
*NL*
one
has
conventional
worldly
notions
and
habits
without
instruction
*NL*
and
without
polish
,
surely
the
most
prosaic
form
of
human
life
;
proud
*NL*
respectability
in
a
gig
of
unfashionable
build
;
worldliness
without
*NL*
side-dishes
.
Observing
these
people
narrowly
,
even
when
the
iron
hand
*NL*
of
misfortune
has
shaken
them
from
their
unquestioning
hold
on
the
*NL*
world
,
one
sees
little
trace
of
religion
,
still
less
of
a
*NL*
distinctively
Christian
creed
.
Their
belief
in
the
Unseen
,
so
far
as
*NL*
it
manifests
itself
at
all
,
seems
to
be
rather
a
pagan
kind
;
their
*NL*
moral
notions
,
though
held
with
strong
tenacity
,
seem
to
have
no
*NL*
standard
beyond
hereditary
custom
.
You
could
not
live
among
such
*NL*
people
;
you
are
stifled
for
want
of
an
outlet
toward
something
*NL*
beautiful
,
great
,
or
noble
;
you
are
irritated
with
these
dull
men
and
*NL*
women
,
as
a
kind
of
population
out
of
keeping
with
the
earth
on
which
*NL*
they
live
,
--
with
this
rich
plain
where
the
great
river
flows
forever
*NL*
onward
,
and
links
the
small
pulse
of
the
old
English
town
with
the
*NL*
beatings
of
the
world
's
mighty
heart
.
A
vigorous
superstition
,
that
*NL*
lashes
its
gods
or
lashes
its
own
back
,
seems
to
be
more
congruous
*NL*
with
the
mystery
of
the
human
lot
,
than
the
mental
condition
of
these
*NL*
emmet-like
Dodsons
and
Tullivers
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
share
with
you
this
sense
of
oppressive
narrowness
;
but
it
is
*NL*
necessary
that
we
should
feel
it
,
if
we
care
to
understand
how
it
*NL*
acted
on
the
lives
of
Tom
and
Maggie
,
--
how
it
has
acted
on
young
*NL*
natures
in
many
generations
,
that
in
the
onward
tendency
of
human
*NL*
things
have
risen
above
the
mental
level
of
the
generation
before
*NL*
them
,
to
which
they
have
been
nevertheless
tied
by
the
strongest
*NL*
fibres
of
their
hearts
.
The
suffering
,
whether
of
martyr
or
victim
,
*NL*
which
belongs
to
every
historical
advance
of
mankind
,
is
represented
*NL*
in
this
way
in
every
town
,
and
by
hundreds
of
obscure
hearths
;
and
we
*NL*
need
not
shrink
from
this
comparison
of
small
things
with
great
;
for
*NL*
does
not
science
tell
us
that
its
highest
striving
is
after
the
*NL*
ascertainment
of
a
unity
which
shall
bind
the
smallest
things
with
the
*NL*
greatest
?
In
natural
science
,
I
have
understood
,
there
is
nothing
*NL*
petty
to
the
mind
that
has
a
large
vision
of
relations
,
and
to
which
*NL*
every
single
object
suggests
a
vast
sum
of
conditions
.
It
is
surely
*NL*
the
same
with
the
observation
of
human
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
Certainly
the
religious
and
moral
ideas
of
the
Dodsons
and
Tullivers
*NL*
were
of
too
specific
a
kind
to
be
arrived
at
deductively
,
from
the
*NL*
statement
that
they
were
part
of
the
Protestant
population
of
Great
*NL*
Britain
.
Their
theory
of
life
had
its
core
of
soundness
,
as
all
*NL*
theories
must
have
on
which
decent
and
prosperous
families
have
been
*NL*
reared
and
have
flourished
;
but
it
had
the
very
slightest
tincture
of
*NL*
theology
.
If
,
in
the
maiden
days
of
the
Dodson
sisters
,
their
Bibles
*NL*
opened
more
easily
at
some
parts
than
others
,
it
was
because
of
dried
*NL*
tulip-petals
,
which
had
been
distributed
quite
impartially
,
without
*NL*
preference
for
the
historical
,
devotional
,
or
doctrinal
.
Their
*NL*
religion
was
of
a
simple
,
semi-pagan
kind
,
but
there
was
no
heresy
in
*NL*
it
,
--
if
heresy
properly
means
choice
,
--
for
they
did
n't
know
there
was
*NL*
any
other
religion
,
except
that
of
chapel-goers
,
which
appeared
to
run
*NL*
in
families
,
like
asthma
.
How
_
should
_
they
know
?
The
vicar
of
their
*NL*
pleasant
rural
parish
was
not
a
controversialist
,
but
a
good
hand
at
*NL*
whist
,
and
one
who
had
a
joke
always
ready
for
a
blooming
female
*NL*
parishioner
.
The
religion
of
the
Dodsons
consisted
in
revering
*NL*
whatever
was
customary
and
respectable
;
it
was
necessary
to
be
*NL*
baptized
,
else
one
could
not
be
buried
in
the
church-yard
,
and
to
take
*NL*
the
sacrament
before
death
,
as
a
security
against
more
dimly
*NL*
understood
perils
;
but
it
was
of
equal
necessity
to
have
the
proper
*NL*
pall-bearers
and
well-cured
hams
at
one
's
funeral
,
and
to
leave
an
*NL*
unimpeachable
will
.
A
Dodson
would
not
be
taxed
with
the
omission
of
*NL*
anything
that
was
becoming
,
or
that
belonged
to
that
eternal
fitness
*NL*
of
things
which
was
plainly
indicated
in
the
practice
of
the
most
*NL*
substantial
parishioners
,
and
in
the
family
traditions
,
--
such
as
*NL*
obedience
to
parents
,
faithfulness
to
kindred
,
industry
,
rigid
*NL*
honesty
,
thrift
,
the
thorough
scouring
of
wooden
and
copper
utensils
,
*NL*
the
hoarding
of
coins
likely
to
disappear
from
the
currency
,
the
*NL*
production
of
first-rate
commodities
for
the
market
,
and
the
general
*NL*
preference
of
whatever
was
home-made
.
The
Dodsons
were
a
very
proud
*NL*
race
,
and
their
pride
lay
in
the
utter
frustration
of
all
desire
to
*NL*
tax
them
with
a
breach
of
traditional
duty
or
propriety
.
A
wholesome
*NL*
pride
in
many
respects
,
since
it
identified
honor
with
perfect
*NL*
integrity
,
thoroughness
of
work
,
and
faithfulness
to
admitted
rules
;
*NL*
and
society
owes
some
worthy
qualities
in
many
of
her
members
to
*NL*
mothers
of
the
Dodson
class
,
who
made
their
butter
and
their
fromenty
*NL*
well
,
and
would
have
felt
disgraced
to
make
it
otherwise
.
To
be
honest
*NL*
and
poor
was
never
a
Dodson
motto
,
still
less
to
seem
rich
though
*NL*
being
poor
;
rather
,
the
family
badge
was
to
be
honest
and
rich
,
and
*NL*
not
only
rich
,
but
richer
than
was
supposed
.
To
live
respected
,
and
*NL*
have
the
proper
bearers
at
your
funeral
,
was
an
achievement
of
the
*NL*
ends
of
existence
that
would
be
entirely
nullified
if
,
on
the
reading
*NL*
of
your
will
,
you
sank
in
the
opinion
of
your
fellow-men
,
either
by
*NL*
turning
out
to
be
poorer
than
they
expected
,
or
by
leaving
your
money
*NL*
in
a
capricious
manner
,
without
strict
regard
to
degrees
of
kin
.
The
*NL*
right
thing
must
always
be
done
toward
kindred
.
The
right
thing
was
to
*NL*
correct
them
severely
,
if
they
were
other
than
a
credit
to
the
family
,
*NL*
but
still
not
to
alienate
from
them
the
smallest
rightful
share
in
the
*NL*
family
shoebuckles
and
other
property
.
A
conspicuous
quality
in
the
*NL*
Dodson
character
was
its
genuineness
;
its
vices
and
virtues
alike
were
*NL*
phases
of
a
proud
honest
egoism
,
which
had
a
hearty
dislike
to
*NL*
whatever
made
against
its
own
credit
and
interest
,
and
would
be
*NL*
frankly
hard
of
speech
to
inconvenient
``
kin
,
''
but
would
never
forsake
*NL*
or
ignore
them
,
--
would
not
let
them
want
bread
,
but
only
require
them
*NL*
to
eat
it
with
bitter
herbs
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
same
sort
of
traditional
belief
ran
in
the
Tulliver
veins
,
but
it
*NL*
was
carried
in
richer
blood
,
having
elements
of
generous
imprudence
,
*NL*
warm
affection
,
and
hot-tempered
rashness
.
Mr.
Tulliver
's
grandfather
*NL*
had
been
heard
to
say
that
he
was
descended
from
one
Ralph
Tulliver
,
a
*NL*
wonderfully
clever
fellow
,
who
had
ruined
himself
.
It
is
likely
enough
*NL*
that
the
clever
Ralph
was
a
high
liver
,
rode
spirited
horses
,
and
was
*NL*
very
decidedly
of
his
own
opinion
.
On
the
other
hand
,
nobody
had
ever
*NL*
heard
of
a
Dodson
who
had
ruined
himself
;
it
was
not
the
way
of
that
*NL*
family
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
such
were
the
views
of
life
on
which
the
Dodsons
and
Tullivers
had
*NL*
been
reared
in
the
praiseworthy
past
of
Pitt
and
high
prices
,
you
will
*NL*
infer
from
what
you
already
know
concerning
the
state
of
society
in
*NL*
St.
Ogg
's
,
that
there
had
been
no
highly
modifying
influence
to
act
on
*NL*
them
in
their
maturer
life
.
It
was
still
possible
,
even
in
that
later
*NL*
time
of
anti-Catholic
preaching
,
for
people
to
hold
many
pagan
ideas
,
*NL*
and
believe
themselves
good
church-people
,
notwithstanding
;
so
we
need
*NL*
hardly
feel
any
surprise
at
the
fact
that
Mr.
Tulliver
,
though
a
*NL*
regular
church-goer
,
recorded
his
vindictiveness
on
the
fly-leaf
of
*NL*
his
Bible
.
It
was
not
that
any
harm
could
be
said
concerning
the
vicar
*NL*
of
that
charming
rural
parish
to
which
Dorlcote
Mill
belonged
;
he
was
*NL*
a
man
of
excellent
family
,
an
irreproachable
bachelor
,
of
elegant
*NL*
pursuits
,
--
had
taken
honors
,
and
held
a
fellowship
.
Mr.
Tulliver
*NL*
regarded
him
with
dutiful
respect
,
as
he
did
everything
else
belonging
*NL*
to
the
church-service
;
but
he
considered
that
church
was
one
thing
and
*NL*
common-sense
another
,
and
he
wanted
nobody
to
tell
_
him
_
what
*NL*
commonsense
was
.
Certain
seeds
which
are
required
to
find
a
nidus
for
*NL*
themselves
under
unfavorable
circumstances
have
been
supplied
by
*NL*
nature
with
an
apparatus
of
hooks
,
so
that
they
will
get
a
hold
on
*NL*
very
unreceptive
surfaces
.
The
spiritual
seed
which
had
been
scattered
*NL*
over
Mr.
Tulliver
had
apparently
been
destitute
of
any
corresponding
*NL*
provision
,
and
had
slipped
off
to
the
winds
again
,
from
a
total
*NL*
absence
of
hooks
.

*NL*
The
Torn
Nest
Is
Pierced
by
the
Thorns
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
something
sustaining
in
the
very
agitation
that
accompanies
*NL*
the
first
shocks
of
trouble
,
just
as
an
acute
pain
is
often
a
*NL*
stimulus
,
and
produces
an
excitement
which
is
transient
strength
.
It
*NL*
is
in
the
slow
,
changed
life
that
follows
;
in
the
time
when
sorrow
has
*NL*
become
stale
,
and
has
no
longer
an
emotive
intensity
that
counteracts
*NL*
its
pain
;
in
the
time
when
day
follows
day
in
dull
,
unexpectant
*NL*
sameness
,
and
trial
is
a
dreary
routine
,
--
it
is
then
that
despair
*NL*
threatens
;
it
is
then
that
the
peremptory
hunger
of
the
soul
is
felt
,
*NL*
and
eye
and
ear
are
strained
after
some
unlearned
secret
of
our
*NL*
existence
,
which
shall
give
to
endurance
the
nature
of
satisfaction
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
time
of
utmost
need
was
come
to
Maggie
,
with
her
short
span
of
*NL*
thirteen
years
.
To
the
usual
precocity
of
the
girl
,
she
added
that
*NL*
early
experience
of
struggle
,
of
conflict
between
the
inward
impulse
*NL*
and
outward
fact
,
which
is
the
lot
of
every
imaginative
and
passionate
*NL*
nature
;
and
the
years
since
she
hammered
the
nails
into
her
wooden
*NL*
Fetish
among
the
worm-eaten
shelves
of
the
attic
had
been
filled
with
*NL*
so
eager
a
life
in
the
triple
world
of
Reality
,
Books
,
and
Waking
*NL*
Dreams
,
that
Maggie
was
strangely
old
for
her
years
in
everything
*NL*
except
in
her
entire
want
of
that
prudence
and
self-command
which
were
*NL*
the
qualities
that
made
Tom
manly
in
the
midst
of
his
intellectual
*NL*
boyishness
.
And
now
her
lot
was
beginning
to
have
a
still
,
sad
*NL*
monotony
,
which
threw
her
more
than
ever
on
her
inward
self
.
Her
*NL*
father
was
able
to
attend
to
business
again
,
his
affairs
were
settled
,
*NL*
and
he
was
acting
as
Wakem
's
manager
on
the
old
spot
.
Tom
went
to
and
*NL*
fro
every
morning
and
evening
,
and
became
more
and
more
silent
in
the
*NL*
short
intervals
at
home
;
what
was
there
to
say
?
One
day
was
like
*NL*
another
;
and
Tom
's
interest
in
life
,
driven
back
and
crushed
on
every
*NL*
other
side
,
was
concentrating
itself
into
the
one
channel
of
ambitious
*NL*
resistance
to
misfortune
.
The
peculiarities
of
his
father
and
mother
*NL*
were
very
irksome
to
him
,
now
they
were
laid
bare
of
all
the
softening
*NL*
accompaniments
of
an
easy
,
prosperous
home
;
for
Tom
had
very
clear
,
*NL*
prosaic
eyes
,
not
apt
to
be
dimmed
by
mists
of
feeling
or
imagination
.
*NL*
Poor
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
it
seemed
,
would
never
recover
her
old
self
,
her
*NL*
placid
household
activity
;
how
could
she
?
The
objects
among
which
her
*NL*
mind
had
moved
complacently
were
all
gone
,
--
all
the
little
hopes
and
*NL*
schemes
and
speculations
,
all
the
pleasant
little
cares
about
her
*NL*
treasures
which
had
made
the
world
quite
comprehensible
to
her
for
a
*NL*
quarter
of
a
century
,
since
she
had
made
her
first
purchase
of
the
*NL*
sugar-tongs
,
had
been
suddenly
snatched
away
from
her
,
and
she
*NL*
remained
bewildered
in
this
empty
life
.
Why
that
should
have
happened
*NL*
to
her
which
had
not
happened
to
other
women
remained
an
insoluble
*NL*
question
by
which
she
expressed
her
perpetual
ruminating
comparison
of
*NL*
the
past
with
the
present
.
It
was
piteous
to
see
the
comely
woman
*NL*
getting
thinner
and
more
worn
under
a
bodily
as
well
as
mental
*NL*
restlessness
,
which
made
her
often
wander
about
the
empty
house
after
*NL*
her
work
was
done
,
until
Maggie
,
becoming
alarmed
about
her
,
would
*NL*
seek
her
,
and
bring
her
down
by
telling
her
how
it
vexed
Tom
that
she
*NL*
was
injuring
her
health
by
never
sitting
down
and
resting
herself
.
Yet
*NL*
amidst
this
helpless
imbecility
there
was
a
touching
trait
of
humble
,
*NL*
self-devoting
maternity
,
which
made
Maggie
feel
tenderly
toward
her
*NL*
poor
mother
amidst
all
the
little
wearing
griefs
caused
by
her
mental
*NL*
feebleness
.
She
would
let
Maggie
do
none
of
the
work
that
was
heaviest
*NL*
and
most
soiling
to
the
hands
,
and
was
quite
peevish
when
Maggie
*NL*
attempted
to
relieve
her
from
her
grate-brushing
and
scouring
:
``
Let
it
*NL*
alone
,
my
dear
;
your
hands
`
ull
get
as
hard
as
hard
,
''
she
would
say
;
*NL*
``
it
's
your
mother
's
place
to
do
that
.
I
ca
n't
do
the
sewing
--
my
eyes
*NL*
fail
me
.
''
And
she
would
still
brush
and
carefully
tend
Maggie
's
hair
,
*NL*
which
she
had
become
reconciled
to
,
in
spite
of
its
refusal
to
curl
,
*NL*
now
it
was
so
long
and
massy
.
Maggie
was
not
her
pet
child
,
and
,
in
*NL*
general
,
would
have
been
much
better
if
she
had
been
quite
different
;
*NL*
yet
the
womanly
heart
,
so
bruised
in
its
small
personal
desires
,
found
*NL*
a
future
to
rest
on
in
the
life
of
this
young
thing
,
and
the
mother
*NL*
pleased
herself
with
wearing
out
her
own
hands
to
save
the
hands
that
*NL*
had
so
much
more
life
in
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
constant
presence
of
her
mother
's
regretful
bewilderment
was
*NL*
less
painful
to
Maggie
than
that
of
her
father
's
sullen
,
*NL*
incommunicative
depression
.
As
long
as
the
paralysis
was
upon
him
,
and
*NL*
it
seemed
as
if
he
might
always
be
in
a
childlike
condition
of
*NL*
dependence
,
--
as
long
as
he
was
still
only
half
awakened
to
his
*NL*
trouble
,
--
Maggie
had
felt
the
strong
tide
of
pitying
love
almost
as
an
*NL*
inspiration
,
a
new
power
,
that
would
make
the
most
difficult
life
easy
*NL*
for
his
sake
;
but
now
,
instead
of
childlike
dependence
,
there
had
come
*NL*
a
taciturn
,
hard
concentration
of
purpose
,
in
strange
contrast
with
*NL*
his
old
vehement
communicativeness
and
high
spirit
;
and
this
lasted
*NL*
from
day
to
day
,
and
from
week
to
week
,
the
dull
eye
never
brightening
*NL*
with
any
eagerness
or
any
joy
.
It
is
something
cruelly
incomprehensible
*NL*
to
youthful
natures
,
this
sombre
sameness
in
middle-aged
and
elderly
*NL*
people
,
whose
life
has
resulted
in
disappointment
and
discontent
,
to
*NL*
whose
faces
a
smile
becomes
so
strange
that
the
sad
lines
all
about
*NL*
the
lips
and
brow
seem
to
take
no
notice
of
it
,
and
it
hurries
away
*NL*
again
for
want
of
a
welcome
.
``
Why
will
they
not
kindle
up
and
be
*NL*
glad
sometimes
?
''
thinks
young
elasticity
.
``
It
would
be
so
easy
if
they
*NL*
only
liked
to
do
it
.
''
And
these
leaden
clouds
that
never
part
are
apt
*NL*
to
create
impatience
even
in
the
filial
affection
that
streams
forth
in
*NL*
nothing
but
tenderness
and
pity
in
the
time
of
more
obvious
affliction
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Tulliver
lingered
nowhere
away
from
home
;
he
hurried
away
from
*NL*
market
,
he
refused
all
invitations
to
stay
and
chat
,
as
in
old
times
,
*NL*
in
the
houses
where
he
called
on
business
.
He
could
not
be
reconciled
*NL*
with
his
lot
.
There
was
no
attitude
in
which
his
pride
did
not
feel
*NL*
its
bruises
;
and
in
all
behavior
toward
him
,
whether
kind
or
cold
,
he
*NL*
detected
an
allusion
to
the
change
in
his
circumstances
.
Even
the
days
*NL*
on
which
Wakem
came
to
ride
round
the
land
and
inquire
into
the
*NL*
business
were
not
so
black
to
him
as
those
market-days
on
which
he
had
*NL*
met
several
creditors
who
had
accepted
a
composition
from
him
.
To
save
*NL*
something
toward
the
repayment
of
those
creditors
was
the
object
*NL*
toward
which
he
was
now
bending
all
his
thoughts
and
efforts
;
and
*NL*
under
the
influence
of
this
all-compelling
demand
of
his
nature
,
the
*NL*
somewhat
profuse
man
,
who
hated
to
be
stinted
or
to
stint
any
one
else
*NL*
in
his
own
house
,
was
gradually
metamorphosed
into
the
keen-eyed
*NL*
grudger
of
morsels
.
Mrs.
Tulliver
could
not
economize
enough
to
*NL*
satisfy
him
,
in
their
food
and
firing
;
and
he
would
eat
nothing
*NL*
himself
but
what
was
of
the
coarsest
quality
.
Tom
,
though
depressed
*NL*
and
strongly
repelled
by
his
father
's
sullenness
,
and
the
dreariness
*NL*
of
home
,
entered
thoroughly
into
his
father
's
feelings
about
paying
*NL*
the
creditors
;
and
the
poor
lad
brought
his
first
quarter
's
money
,
*NL*
with
a
delicious
sense
of
achievement
,
and
gave
it
to
his
father
to
*NL*
put
into
the
tin
box
which
held
the
savings
.
The
little
store
of
*NL*
sovereigns
in
the
tin
box
seemed
to
be
the
only
sight
that
brought
a
*NL*
faint
beam
of
pleasure
into
the
miller
's
eyes
,
--
faint
and
transient
,
*NL*
for
it
was
soon
dispelled
by
the
thought
that
the
time
would
be
*NL*
long
--
perhaps
longer
than
his
life
,
--
before
the
narrow
savings
could
*NL*
remove
the
hateful
incubus
of
debt
.
A
deficit
of
more
than
five
*NL*
hundred
pounds
,
with
the
accumulating
interest
,
seemed
a
deep
pit
to
*NL*
fill
with
the
savings
from
thirty
shillings
a-week
,
even
when
Tom
's
*NL*
probable
savings
were
to
be
added
.
On
this
one
point
there
was
entire
*NL*
community
of
feeling
in
the
four
widely
differing
beings
who
sat
round
*NL*
the
dying
fire
of
sticks
,
which
made
a
cheap
warmth
for
them
on
the
*NL*
verge
of
bedtime
.
Mrs.
Tulliver
carried
the
proud
integrity
of
the
*NL*
Dodsons
in
her
blood
,
and
had
been
brought
up
to
think
that
to
wrong
*NL*
people
of
their
money
,
which
was
another
phrase
for
debt
,
was
a
sort
*NL*
of
moral
pillory
;
it
would
have
been
wickedness
,
to
her
mind
,
to
have
*NL*
run
counter
to
her
husband
's
desire
to
``
do
the
right
thing
,
''
and
*NL*
retrieve
his
name
.
She
had
a
confused
,
dreamy
notion
that
,
if
the
*NL*
creditors
were
all
paid
,
her
plate
and
linen
ought
to
come
back
to
*NL*
her
;
but
she
had
an
inbred
perception
that
while
people
owed
money
*NL*
they
were
unable
to
pay
,
they
could
n't
rightly
call
anything
their
*NL*
own
.
She
murmured
a
little
that
Mr.
Tulliver
so
peremptorily
refused
*NL*
to
receive
anything
in
repayment
from
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Moss
;
but
to
all
*NL*
his
requirements
of
household
economy
she
was
submissive
to
the
point
*NL*
of
denying
herself
the
cheapest
indulgences
of
mere
flavor
;
her
only
*NL*
rebellion
was
to
smuggle
into
the
kitchen
something
that
would
make
*NL*
rather
a
better
supper
than
usual
for
Tom
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
narrow
notions
about
debt
,
held
by
the
old
fashioned
Tullivers
,
*NL*
may
perhaps
excite
a
smile
on
the
faces
of
many
readers
in
these
days
*NL*
of
wide
commercial
views
and
wide
philosophy
,
according
to
which
*NL*
everything
rights
itself
without
any
trouble
of
ours
.
The
fact
that
my
*NL*
tradesman
is
out
of
pocket
by
me
is
to
be
looked
at
through
the
serene
*NL*
certainty
that
somebody
else
's
tradesman
is
in
pocket
by
somebody
*NL*
else
;
and
since
there
must
be
bad
debts
in
the
world
,
why
,
it
is
mere
*NL*
egoism
not
to
like
that
we
in
particular
should
make
them
instead
of
*NL*
our
fellow-citizens
.
I
am
telling
the
history
of
very
simple
people
,
*NL*
who
had
never
had
any
illuminating
doubts
as
to
personal
integrity
and
*NL*
honor
.
*NL*
*NL*
Under
all
this
grim
melancholy
and
narrowing
concentration
of
desire
,
*NL*
Mr.
Tulliver
retained
the
feeling
toward
his
``
little
wench
''
which
made
*NL*
her
presence
a
need
to
him
,
though
it
would
not
suffice
to
cheer
him
.
*NL*
She
was
still
the
desire
of
his
eyes
;
but
the
sweet
spring
of
fatherly
*NL*
love
was
now
mingled
with
bitterness
,
like
everything
else
.
When
*NL*
Maggie
laid
down
her
work
at
night
,
it
was
her
habit
to
get
a
low
*NL*
stool
and
sit
by
her
father
's
knee
,
leaning
her
cheek
against
it
.
How
*NL*
she
wished
he
would
stroke
her
head
,
or
give
some
sign
that
he
was
*NL*
soothed
by
the
sense
that
he
had
a
daughter
who
loved
him
!
But
now
she
*NL*
got
no
answer
to
her
little
caresses
,
either
from
her
father
or
from
*NL*
Tom
,
--
the
two
idols
of
her
life
.
Tom
was
weary
and
abstracted
in
the
*NL*
short
intervals
when
he
was
at
home
,
and
her
father
was
bitterly
*NL*
preoccupied
with
the
thought
that
the
girl
was
growing
up
,
was
*NL*
shooting
up
into
a
woman
;
and
how
was
she
to
do
well
in
life
?
She
had
*NL*
a
poor
chance
for
marrying
,
down
in
the
world
as
they
were
.
And
he
*NL*
hated
the
thought
of
her
marrying
poorly
,
as
her
aunt
Gritty
had
done
;
*NL*
_
that
_
would
be
a
thing
to
make
him
turn
in
his
grave
,
--
the
little
*NL*
wench
so
pulled
down
by
children
and
toil
,
as
her
aunt
Moss
was
.
When
*NL*
uncultured
minds
,
confined
to
a
narrow
range
of
personal
experience
,
*NL*
are
under
the
pressure
of
continued
misfortune
,
their
inward
life
is
*NL*
apt
to
become
a
perpetually
repeated
round
of
sad
and
bitter
thoughts
;
*NL*
the
same
words
,
the
same
scenes
,
are
revolved
over
and
over
again
,
the
*NL*
same
mood
accompanies
them
;
the
end
of
the
year
finds
them
as
much
*NL*
what
they
were
at
the
beginning
as
if
they
were
machines
set
to
a
*NL*
recurrent
series
of
movements
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sameness
of
the
days
was
broken
by
few
visitors
.
Uncles
and
aunts
*NL*
paid
only
short
visits
now
;
of
course
,
they
could
not
stay
to
meals
,
*NL*
and
the
constraint
caused
by
Mr.
Tulliver
's
savage
silence
,
which
*NL*
seemed
to
add
to
the
hollow
resonance
of
the
bare
,
uncarpeted
room
*NL*
when
the
aunts
were
talking
,
heightened
the
unpleasantness
of
these
*NL*
family
visits
on
all
sides
,
and
tended
to
make
them
rare
.
As
for
other
*NL*
acquaintances
,
there
is
a
chill
air
surrounding
those
who
are
down
in
*NL*
the
world
,
and
people
are
glad
to
get
away
from
them
,
as
from
a
cold
*NL*
room
;
human
beings
,
mere
men
and
women
,
without
furniture
,
without
*NL*
anything
to
offer
you
,
who
have
ceased
to
count
as
anybody
,
present
an
*NL*
embarrassing
negation
of
reasons
for
wishing
to
see
them
,
or
of
*NL*
subjects
on
which
to
converse
with
them
.
At
that
distant
day
,
there
*NL*
was
a
dreary
isolation
in
the
civilized
Christian
society
of
these
*NL*
realms
for
families
that
had
dropped
below
their
original
level
,
*NL*
unless
they
belonged
to
a
sectarian
church
,
which
gets
some
warmth
of
*NL*
brotherhood
by
walling
in

sacred

Chapter

*NL*
*NL*
A
Voice
from
the
Past
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
One
afternoon
,
when
the
chestnuts
were
coming
into
flower
,
Maggie
had
*NL*
brought
her
chair
outside
the
front
door
,
and
was
seated
there
with
a
*NL*
book
on
her
knees
.
Her
dark
eyes
had
wandered
from
the
book
,
but
they
*NL*
did
not
seem
to
be
enjoying
the
sunshine
which
pierced
the
screen
of
*NL*
jasmine
on
the
projecting
porch
at
her
right
,
and
threw
leafy
shadows
*NL*
on
her
pale
round
cheek
;
they
seemed
rather
to
be
searching
for
*NL*
something
that
was
not
disclosed
by
the
sunshine
.
It
had
been
a
more
*NL*
miserable
day
than
usual
;
her
father
,
after
a
visit
of
Wakem
's
had
had
*NL*
a
paroxysm
of
rage
,
in
which
for
some
trifling
fault
he
had
beaten
the
*NL*
boy
who
served
in
the
mill
.
Once
before
,
since
his
illness
,
he
had
had
*NL*
a
similar
paroxysm
,
in
which
he
had
beaten
his
horse
,
and
the
scene
*NL*
had
left
a
lasting
terror
in
Maggie
's
mind
.
The
thought
had
risen
,
*NL*
that
some
time
or
other
he
might
beat
her
mother
if
she
happened
to
*NL*
speak
in
her
feeble
way
at
the
wrong
moment
.
The
keenest
of
all
dread
*NL*
with
her
was
lest
her
father
should
add
to
his
present
misfortune
the
*NL*
wretchedness
of
doing
something
irretrievably
disgraceful
.
The
*NL*
battered
school-book
of
Tom
's
which
she
held
on
her
knees
could
give
*NL*
her
no
fortitude
under
the
pressure
of
that
dread
;
and
again
and
again
*NL*
her
eyes
had
filled
with
tears
,
as
they
wandered
vaguely
,
seeing
*NL*
neither
the
chestnut-trees
,
nor
the
distant
horizon
,
but
only
future
*NL*
scenes
of
home-sorrow
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
she
was
roused
by
the
sound
of
the
opening
gate
and
of
*NL*
footsteps
on
the
gravel
.
It
was
not
Tom
who
was
entering
,
but
a
man
in
*NL*
a
sealskin
cap
and
a
blue
plush
waistcoat
,
carrying
a
pack
on
his
*NL*
back
,
and
followed
closely
by
a
bullterrier
of
brindled
coat
and
*NL*
defiant
aspect
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Bob
,
it
's
you
!
''
said
Maggie
,
starting
up
with
a
smile
of
pleased
*NL*
recognition
,
for
there
had
been
no
abundance
of
kind
acts
to
efface
*NL*
the
recollection
of
Bob
's
generosity
;
``
I
'm
so
glad
to
see
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
Miss
,
''
said
Bob
,
lifting
his
cap
and
showing
a
delighted
*NL*
face
,
but
immediately
relieving
himself
of
some
accompanying
*NL*
embarrassment
by
looking
down
at
his
dog
,
and
saying
in
a
tone
of
*NL*
disgust
,
``
Get
out
wi
'
you
,
you
thunderin
'
sawney
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
brother
is
not
at
home
yet
,
Bob
,
''
said
Maggie
;
``
he
is
always
at
*NL*
St.
Ogg
's
in
the
daytime
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Miss
,
''
said
Bob
,
``
I
should
be
glad
to
see
Mr.
Tom
,
but
that
*NL*
is
n't
just
what
I
'm
come
for
,
--
look
here
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bob
was
in
the
act
of
depositing
his
pack
on
the
door-step
,
and
with
*NL*
it
a
row
of
small
books
fastened
together
with
string
.
*NL*
*NL*
Apparently
,
however
,
they
were
not
the
object
to
which
he
wished
to
*NL*
call
Maggie
's
attention
,
but
rather
something
which
he
had
carried
*NL*
under
his
arm
,
wrapped
in
a
red
handkerchief
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
See
here
!
''
he
said
again
,
laying
the
red
parcel
on
the
others
and
*NL*
unfolding
it
;
``
you
wo
n't
think
I
'm
a-makin
'
too
free
,
Miss
,
I
hope
,
*NL*
but
I
lighted
on
these
books
,
and
I
thought
they
might
make
up
to
you
*NL*
a
bit
for
them
as
you
've
lost
;
for
I
heared
you
speak
o
'
picturs
,
--
an
'
*NL*
as
for
picturs
,
_
look
_
here
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
opening
of
the
red
handkerchief
had
disclosed
a
superannuated
*NL*
``
Keepsake
''
and
six
or
seven
numbers
of
a
``
Portrait
Gallery
,
''
in
royal
*NL*
octavo
;
and
the
emphatic
request
to
look
referred
to
a
portrait
of
*NL*
George
the
Fourth
in
all
the
majesty
of
his
depressed
cranium
and
*NL*
voluminous
neckcloth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
all
sorts
o
'
genelmen
here
,
''
Bob
went
on
,
turning
over
the
*NL*
leaves
with
some
excitement
,
``

all

he
added

*NL*
opening
the
``

a-sittin

on

out

at

balls
in

there

I
sot
up

was
gone

twelve
last
night

a-lookin

I
did

till
they
stared
at

out

know
when
I
spoke
to
'em
.
But
,

I
*NL*
should
n't

what
to

They
'll
be
more
fittin

for
*NL*
you
,
Miss
;
and
the
man
at
the
book-stall
,
he
said
they
banged
*NL*
iverything
for
picturs
;
he
said
they
was
a
fust-rate
article
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
've
bought
them
for
me
,
Bob
?
''
said
Maggie
,
deeply
touched
by
*NL*
this
simple
kindness
.
``
How
very
,
very
good
of
you
!
But
I
'm
afraid
you
*NL*
gave
a
great
deal
of
money
for
them
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Not

said
Bob

``
I

up

was
sold
away
from

For
I

niver

how
you
looked
when
you
fretted
about

gone

then

here
*NL*
Bob
took
up
the
small
stringed
packet
of
books

``

Bob
,
laying
down
his
pack
again
,
which
he
had
taken
up
with
the
*NL*
intention
of
hurrying
away
;
for
he
felt
considerable
shyness
in
*NL*
talking
to
a
young
lass
like
Maggie
,
though
,
as
he
usually
said
of
*NL*
himself
,
``
his
tongue
overrun
him

when
he
began
to
speak
.
``
I

-LRB-
Mumps
declined
to
express

himself
more
diffusely
than
by
a
single
affirmative
movement
of
his

tail

abruptly
taking
up

again

under
the
consciousness

his

acting

The

face
,
which
seemed
to
be
tolerating
the
*NL*
superfluous
existence
of
objects
in
general

strongly
confirmatory

*NL*
``
Good-by

very
much
for

again

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Miss
,
''
said
Bob
,
moving
on
a
few
steps
;
then
turning
half
round
*NL*
he
said
,
``
I
'll
leave
off
that
trick

'
my
big
thumb

*NL*

a
big

It

well

been

''
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
,
thus
exalted
into
Bob
's
exalting
Madonna
,
laughed
in
spite
of
*NL*
herself
;
at
which
her
worshipper
's
blue
eyes
twinkled
too
,
and
under
*NL*
these
favoring
auspices
he
touched
his
cap
and
walked
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
days
of
chivalry
are
not
gone
,
notwithstanding
Burke
's
grand
dirge
*NL*
over
them
;
they
live
still
in
that
far-off
worship
paid
by
many
a
*NL*
youth
and
man
to
the
woman
of
whom
he
never
dreams
that
he
shall
touch
*NL*
so
much
as
her
little
finger
or
the
hem
of
her
robe
.
Bob
,
with
the
*NL*
pack
on
his
back
,
had
as
respectful
an
adoration
for
this
dark-eyed
*NL*
maiden
as
if
he
had
been
a
knight
in
armor
calling
aloud
on
her
name
*NL*
as
he
pricked
on
to
the
fight
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
gleam
of
merriment
soon
died
away
from
Maggie
's
face
,
and
perhaps
*NL*
only
made
the
returning
gloom
deeper
by
contrast
.
She
was
too
*NL*
dispirited
even
to
like
answering
questions
about
Bob
's
present
of
*NL*
books
,
and
she
carried
them
away
to
her
bedroom
,
laying
them
down
*NL*
there
and
seating
herself
on
her
one
stool
,
without
caring
to
look
at
*NL*
them
just
yet
.
She
leaned
her
cheek
against
the
window-frame
,
and
*NL*
thought
that
the
light-hearted
Bob
had
a
lot
much
happier
than
hers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
's
sense
of
loneliness
,
and
utter
privation
of
joy
,
had
deepened
*NL*
with
the
brightness
of
advancing
spring
.
All
the
favorite
outdoor
*NL*
nooks
about
home
,
which
seemed
to
have
done
their
part
with
her
*NL*
parents
in
nurturing
and
cherishing
her
,
were
now
mixed
up
with
the
*NL*
home-sadness
,
and
gathered
no
smile
from
the
sunshine
.
Every
*NL*
affection
,
every
delight
the
poor
child
had
had
,
was
like
an
aching
*NL*
nerve
to
her
.
There
was
no
music
for
her
any
more
,
--
no
piano
,
no
*NL*
harmonized
voices
,
no
delicious
stringed
instruments
,
with
their
*NL*
passionate
cries
of
imprisoned
spirits
sending
a
strange
vibration
*NL*
through
her
frame
.
And
of
all
her
school-life
there
was
nothing
left
*NL*
her
now
but
her
little
collection
of
school-books
,
which
she
turned
*NL*
over
with
a
sickening
sense
that
she
knew
them
all
,
and
they
were
all
*NL*
barren
of
comfort
.
Even
at
school
she
had
often
wished
for
books
with
*NL*
_
more
_
in
them
;
everything
she
learned
there
seemed
like
the
ends
of
*NL*
long
threads
that
snapped
immediately
.
And
now
--
without
the
indirect
*NL*
charm
of
school-emulation
--
Telemaque
was
mere
bran
;
so
were
the
hard
,
*NL*
dry
questions
on
Christian
Doctrine
;
there
was
no
flavor
in
them
,
no
*NL*
strength
.
Sometimes
Maggie
thought
she
could
have
been
contented
with
*NL*
absorbing
fancies
;
if
she
could
have
had
all
Scott
's
novels
and
all
*NL*
Byron
's
poems
!
--
then
,
perhaps
,
she
might
have
found
happiness
enough
*NL*
to
dull
her
sensibility
to
her
actual
daily
life
.
And
yet
they
were
*NL*
hardly
what
she
wanted
.
She
could
make
dream-worlds
of
her
own
,
but
no
*NL*
dream-world
would
satisfy
her
now
.
She
wanted
some
explanation
of
this
*NL*
hard
,
real
life
,
--
the
unhappy-looking
father
,
seated
at
the
dull
*NL*
breakfast-table
;
the
childish
,
bewildered
mother
;
the
little
sordid
*NL*
tasks
that
filled
the
hours
,
or
the
more
oppressive
emptiness
of
*NL*
weary
,
joyless
leisure
;
the
need
of
some
tender
,
demonstrative
love
;
*NL*
the
cruel
sense
that
Tom
did
n't
mind
what
she
thought
or
felt
,
and
*NL*
that
they
were
no
longer
playfellows
together
;
the
privation
of
all
*NL*
pleasant
things
that
had
come
to
_
her
_
more
than
to
others
,
--
she
*NL*
wanted
some
key
that
would
enable
her
to
understand
,
and
in
*NL*
understanding
,
to
endure
,
the
heavy
weight
that
had
fallen
on
her
*NL*
young
heart
.
If
she
had
been
taught
``
real
learning
and
wisdom
,
such
as
*NL*
great
men
knew
,
''
she
thought
she
should
have
held
the
secrets
of
life
;
*NL*
if
she
had
only
books
,
that
she
might
learn
for
herself
what
wise
men
*NL*
knew
!
Saints
and
martyrs
had
never
interested
Maggie
so
much
as
sages
*NL*
and
poets
.
She
knew
little
of
saints
and
martyrs
,
and
had
gathered
,
as
*NL*
a
general
result
of
her
teaching
,
that
they
were
a
temporary
provision
*NL*
against
the
spread
of
Catholicism
,
and
had
all
died
at
Smithfield
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
one
of
these
meditations
it
occurred
to
her
that
she
had
forgotten
*NL*
Tom
's
school-books
,
which
had
been
sent
home
in
his
trunk
.
But
she
*NL*
found
the
stock
unaccountably
shrunk
down
to
the
few
old
ones
which
*NL*
had
been
well
thumbed
,
--
the
Latin
Dictionary
and
Grammar
,
a
Delectus
,
*NL*
a
torn
Eutropius
,
the
well-worn
Virgil
,
Aldrich
's
Logic
,
and
the
*NL*
exasperating
Euclid
.
Still
,
Latin
,
Euclid
,
and
Logic
would
surely
be
a
*NL*
considerable
step
in
masculine
wisdom
,
--
in
that
knowledge
which
made
*NL*
men
contented
,
and
even
glad
to
live
.
Not
that
the
yearning
for
*NL*
effectual
wisdom
was
quite
unmixed
;
a
certain
mirage
would
now
and
*NL*
then
rise
on
the
desert
of
the
future
,
in
which
she
seemed
to
see
*NL*
herself
honored
for
her
surprising
attainments
.
And
so
the
poor
child
,
*NL*
with
her
soul
's
hunger
and
her
illusions
of
self-flattery
,
began
to
*NL*
nibble
at
this
thick-rinded
fruit
of
the
tree
of
knowledge
,
filling
*NL*
her
vacant
hours
with
Latin
,
geometry
,
and
the
forms
of
the
syllogism
,
*NL*
and
feeling
a
gleam
of
triumph
now
and
then
that
her
understanding
was
*NL*
quite
equal
to
these
peculiarly
masculine
studies
.
For
a
week
or
two
*NL*
she
went
on
resolutely
enough
,
though
with
an
occasional
sinking
of
*NL*
heart
,
as
if
she
had
set
out
toward
the
Promised
Land
alone
,
and
found
*NL*
it
a
thirsty
,
trackless
,
uncertain
journey
.
In
the
severity
of
her
*NL*
early
resolution
,
she
would
take
Aldrich
out
into
the
fields
,
and
then
*NL*
look
off
her
book
toward
the
sky
,
where
the
lark
was
twinkling
,
or
to
*NL*
the
reeds
and
bushes
by
the
river
,
from
which
the
waterfowl
rustled
*NL*
forth
on
its
anxious
,
awkward
flight
,
--
with
a
startled
sense
that
the
*NL*
relation
between
Aldrich
and
this
living
world
was
extremely
remote
*NL*
for
her
.
The
discouragement
deepened
as
the
days
went
on
,
and
the
*NL*
eager
heart
gained
faster
and
faster
on
the
patient
mind
.
Somehow
,
*NL*
when
she
sat
at
the
window
with
her
book
,
her
eyes
_
would
_
fix
*NL*
themselves
blankly
on
the
outdoor
sunshine
;
then
they
would
fill
with
*NL*
tears
,
and
sometimes
,
if
her
mother
was
not
in
the
room
,
the
studies
*NL*
would
all
end
in
sobbing
.
She
rebelled
against
her
lot
,
she
fainted
*NL*
under
its
loneliness
,
and
fits
even
of
anger
and
hatred
toward
her
*NL*
father
and
mother
,
who
were
so
unlike
what
she
would
have
them
to
be
;
*NL*
toward
Tom
,
who
checked
her
,
and
met
her
thought
or
feeling
always
by
*NL*
some
thwarting
difference
,
--
would
flow
out
over
her
affections
and
*NL*
conscience
like
a
lava
stream
,
and
frighten
her
with
a
sense
that
it
*NL*
was
not
difficult
for
her
to
become
a
demon
.
Then
her
brain
would
be
*NL*
busy
with
wild
romances
of
a
flight
from
home
in
search
of
something
*NL*
less
sordid
and
dreary
;
she
would
go
to
some
great
man
--
Walter
Scott
,
*NL*
perhaps
--
and
tell
him
how
wretched
and
how
clever
she
was
,
and
he
*NL*
would
surely
do
something
for
her
.
But
,
in
the
middle
of
her
vision
,
*NL*
her
father
would
perhaps
enter
the
room
for
the
evening
,
and
,
*NL*
surprised
that
she
sat
still
without
noticing
him
,
would
say
*NL*
complainingly
,
``
Come
,
am
I
to
fetch
my
slippers
myself
?
''
The
voice
*NL*
pierced
through
Maggie
like
a
sword
;
there
was
another
sadness
besides
*NL*
her
own
,
and
she
had
been
thinking
of
turning
her
back
on
it
and
*NL*
forsaking
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
afternoon
,
the
sight
of
Bob
's
cheerful
freckled
face
had
given
*NL*
her
discontent
a
new
direction
.
She
thought
it
was
part
of
the
*NL*
hardship
of
her
life
that
there
was
laid
upon
her
the
burthen
of
*NL*
larger
wants
than
others
seemed
to
feel
,
--
that
she
had
to
endure
this
*NL*
wide
,
hopeless
yearning
for
that
something
,
whatever
it
was
,
that
was
*NL*
greatest
and
best
on
this
earth
.
She
wished
she
could
have
been
like
*NL*
Bob
,
with
his
easily
satisfied
ignorance
,
or
like
Tom
,
who
had
*NL*
something
to
do
on
which
he
could
fix
his
mind
with
a
steady
purpose
,
*NL*
and
disregard
everything
else
.
Poor
child
!
as
she
leaned
her
head
*NL*
against
the
window-frame
,
with
her
hands
clasped
tighter
and
tighter
,
*NL*
and
her
foot
beating
the
ground
,
she
was
as
lonely
in
her
trouble
as
*NL*
if
she
had
been
the
only
girl
in
the
civilized
world
of
that
day
who
*NL*
had
come
out
of
her
school-life
with
a
soul
untrained
for
inevitable
*NL*
struggles
,
with
no
other
part
of
her
inherited
share
in
the
hard-won
*NL*
treasures
of
thought
which
generations
of
painful
toil
have
laid
up
*NL*
for
the
race
of
men
,
than
shreds
and
patches
of
feeble
literature
and
*NL*
false
history
,
with
much
futile
information
about
Saxon
and
other
*NL*
kings
of
doubtful
example
,
but
unhappily
quite
without
that
knowledge
*NL*
of
the
irreversible
laws
within
and
without
her
,
which
,
governing
the
*NL*
habits
,
becomes
morality
,
and
developing
the
feelings
of
submission
*NL*
and
dependence
,
becomes
religion
,
--
as
lonely
in
her
trouble
as
if
*NL*
every
other
girl
besides
herself
had
been
cherished
and
watched
over
*NL*
by
elder
minds
,
not
forgetful
of
their
own
early
time
,
when
need
was
*NL*
keen
and
impulse
strong
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
Maggie
's
eyes
glanced
down
on
the
books
that
lay
on
the
*NL*
window-shelf
,
and
she
half
forsook
her
reverie
to
turn
over
listlessly
*NL*
the
leaves
of
the
``
Portrait
Gallery
,
''
but
she
soon
pushed
this
aside
*NL*
to
examine
the
little
row
of
books
tied
together
with
string
.
*NL*
``
Beauties
of
the
Spectator
,
''
``
Rasselas
,
''
``
Economy
of
Human
Life
,
''
*NL*
``
Gregory
's
Letters
,
''
--
she
knew
the
sort
of
matter
that
was
inside
all
*NL*
these
;
the
``
Christian
Year
,
''
--
that
seemed
to
be
a
hymnbook
,
and
she
*NL*
laid
it
down
again
;
but
_
Thomas
a
Kempis
?
_
--
the
name
had
come
across
*NL*
her
in
her
reading
,
and
she
felt
the
satisfaction
,
which
every
one
*NL*
knows
,
of
getting
some
ideas
to
attach
to
a
name
that
strays
solitary
*NL*
in
the
memory
.
She
took
up
the
little
,
old
,
clumsy
book
with
some
*NL*
curiosity
;
it
had
the
corners
turned
down
in
many
places
,
and
some
*NL*
hand
,
now
forever
quiet
,
had
made
at
certain
passages
strong
*NL*
pen-and-ink
marks
,
long
since
browned
by
time
.
Maggie
turned
from
leaf
*NL*
to
leaf
,
and
read
where
the
quiet
hand
pointed
:
``
Know
that
the
love
of
*NL*
thyself
doth
hurt
thee
more
than
anything
in
the
world
...
If
thou
*NL*
seekest
this
or
that
,
and
wouldst
be
here
or
there
to
enjoy
thy
own
*NL*
will
and
pleasure
,
thou
shalt
never
be
quiet
nor
free
from
care
;
for
*NL*
in
everything
somewhat
will
be
wanting
,
and
in
every
place
there
will
*NL*
be
some
that
will
cross
thee
...
Both
above
and
below
,
which
way
*NL*
soever
thou
dost
turn
thee
,
everywhere
thou
shalt
find
the
Cross
;
and
*NL*
everywhere
of
necessity
thou
must
have
patience
,
if
thou
wilt
have
*NL*
inward
peace
,
and
enjoy
an
everlasting
crown
...
If
thou
desirest
to
*NL*
mount
unto
this
height
,
thou
must
set
out
courageously
,
and
lay
the
*NL*
axe
to
the
root
,
that
thou
mayest
pluck
up
and
destroy
that
hidden
*NL*
inordinate
inclination
to
thyself
,
and
unto
all
private
and
earthly
*NL*
good
.
On
this
sin
,
that
a
man
inordinately
loveth
himself
,
almost
all
*NL*
dependeth
,
whatsoever
is
thoroughly
to
be
overcome
;
which
evil
being
*NL*
once
overcome
and
subdued
,
there
will
presently
ensue
great
peace
and
*NL*
tranquillity
...
It
is
but
little
thou
sufferest
in
comparison
of
them
*NL*
that
have
suffered
so
much
,
were
so
strongly
tempted
,
so
grievously
*NL*
afflicted
,
so
many
ways
tried
and
exercised
.
Thou
oughtest
therefore
*NL*
to
call
to
mind
the
more
heavy
sufferings
of
others
,
that
thou
mayest
*NL*
the
easier
bear
thy
little
adversities
.
And
if
they
seem
not
little
*NL*
unto
thee
,
beware
lest
thy
impatience
be
the
cause
thereof
...
Blessed
*NL*
are
those
ears
that
receive
the
whispers
of
the
divine
voice
,
and
*NL*
listen
not
to
the
whisperings
of
the
world
.
Blessed
are
those
ears
*NL*
which
hearken
not
unto
the
voice
which
soundeth
outwardly
,
but
unto
*NL*
the
Truth
,
which
teacheth
inwardly
.
''
*NL*

A
strange
thrill
of
awe
passed
through
Maggie
while
she
read
,
as
if
*NL*
she
had
been
wakened
in
the
night
by
a
strain
of
solemn
music
,
telling
*NL*
of
beings
whose
souls
had
been
astir
while
hers
was
in
stupor
.
She
*NL*
went
on
from
one
brown
mark
to
another
,
where
the
quiet
hand
seemed
to
*NL*
point
,
hardly
conscious
that
she
was
reading
,
seeming
rather
to
listen
*NL*
while
a
low
voice
said
;
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
dost
thou
here
gaze
about
,
since
this
is
not
the
place
of
thy
*NL*
rest
?
In
heaven
ought
to
be
thy
dwelling
,
and
all
earthly
things
are
*NL*
to
be
looked
on
as
they
forward
thy
journey
thither
.
All
things
pass
*NL*
away
,
and
thou
together
with
them
.
Beware
thou
cleavest
not
unto
them
,
*NL*
lest
thou
be
entangled
and
perish
...
If
a
man
should
give
all
his
*NL*
substance
,
yet
it
is
as
nothing
.
And
if
he
should
do
great
penances
,
*NL*
yet
are
they
but
little
.
And
if
he
should
attain
to
all
knowledge
,
he
*NL*
is
yet
far
off
.
And
if
he
should
be
of
great
virtue
,
and
very
fervent
*NL*
devotion
,
yet
is
there
much
wanting
;
to
wit
,
one
thing
,
which
is
most
*NL*
necessary
for
him
.
What
is
that
?
That
having
left
all
,
he
leave
*NL*
himself
,
and
go
wholly
out
of
himself
,
and
retain
nothing
of
*NL*
self-love
...
I
have
often
said
unto
thee
,
and
now
again
I
say
the
*NL*
same
,
Forsake
thyself
,
resign
thyself
,
and
thou
shalt
enjoy
much
*NL*
inward
peace
...
Then
shall
all
vain
imaginations
,
evil
perturbations
,
*NL*
and
superfluous
cares
fly
away
;
then
shall
immoderate
fear
leave
thee
,
*NL*
and
inordinate
love
shall
die
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
drew
a
long
breath
and
pushed
her
heavy
hair
back
,
as
if
to
see
*NL*
a
sudden
vision
more
clearly
.
Here
,
then
,
was
a
secret
of
life
that
*NL*
would
enable
her
to
renounce
all
other
secrets
;
here
was
a
sublime
*NL*
height
to
be
reached
without
the
help
of
outward
things
;
here
was
*NL*
insight
,
and
strength
,
and
conquest
,
to
be
won
by
means
entirely
*NL*
within
her
own
soul
,
where
a
supreme
Teacher
was
waiting
to
be
heard
.
*NL*
It
flashed
through
her
like
the
suddenly
apprehended
solution
of
a
*NL*
problem
,
that
all
the
miseries
of
her
young
life
had
come
from
fixing
*NL*
her
heart
on
her
own
pleasure
,
as
if
that
were
the
central
necessity
*NL*
of
the
universe
;
and
for
the
first
time
she
saw
the
possibility
of
*NL*
shifting
the
position
from
which
she
looked
at
the
gratification
of
*NL*
her
own
desires
,
--
of
taking
her
stand
out
of
herself
,
and
looking
at
*NL*
her
own
life
as
an
insignificant
part
of
a
divinely
guided
whole
.
She
*NL*
read
on
and
on
in
the
old
book
,
devouring
eagerly
the
dialogues
with
*NL*
the
invisible
Teacher
,
the
pattern
of
sorrow
,
the
source
of
all
*NL*
strength
;
returning
to
it
after
she
had
been
called
away
,
and
reading
*NL*
till
the
sun
went
down
behind
the
willows
.
With
all
the
hurry
of
an
*NL*
imagination
that
could
never
rest
in
the
present
,
she
sat
in
the
*NL*
deepening
twilight
forming
plans
of
self-humiliation
and
entire
*NL*
devotedness
;
and
in
the
ardor
of
first
discovery
,
renunciation
seemed
*NL*
to
her
the
entrance
into
that
satisfaction
which
she
had
so
long
been
*NL*
craving
in
vain
.
She
had
not
perceived
--
how
could
she
until
she
had
*NL*
lived
longer
?
--
the
inmost
truth
of
the
old
monk
's
out-pourings
,
that
*NL*
renunciation
remains
sorrow
,
though
a
sorrow
borne
willingly
.
Maggie
*NL*
was
still
panting
for
happiness
,
and
was
in
ecstasy
because
she
had
*NL*
found
the
key
to
it
.
She
knew
nothing
of
doctrines
and
systems
,
of
*NL*
mysticism
or
quietism
;
but
this
voice
out
of
the
far-off
middle
ages
*NL*
was
the
direct
communication
of
a
human
soul
's
belief
and
experience
,
*NL*
and
came
to
Maggie
as
an
unquestioned
message
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
suppose
that
is
the
reason
why
the
small
old-fashioned
book
,
for
*NL*
which
you
need
only
pay
sixpence
at
a
book-stall
,
works
miracles
to
*NL*
this
day
,
turning
bitter
waters
into
sweetness
;
while
expensive
*NL*
sermons
and
treatises
,
newly
issued
,
leave
all
things
as
they
were
*NL*
before
.
It
was
written
down
by
a
hand
that
waited
for
the
heart
's
*NL*
prompting
;
it
is
the
chronicle
of
a
solitary
,
hidden
anguish
,
*NL*
struggle
,
trust
,
and
triumph
,
not
written
on
velvet
cushions
to
teach
*NL*
endurance
to
those
who
are
treading
with
bleeding
feet
on
the
stones
.
*NL*
And
so
it
remains
to
all
time
a
lasting
record
of
human
needs
and
*NL*
human
consolations
;
the
voice
of
a
brother
who
,
ages
ago
,
felt
and
*NL*
suffered
and
renounced
,
--
in
the
cloister
,
perhaps
,
with
serge
gown
and
*NL*
tonsured
head
,
with
much
chanting
and
long
fasts
,
and
with
a
fashion
*NL*
of
speech
different
from
ours
,
--
but
under
the
same
silent
far-off
*NL*
heavens
,
and
with
the
same
passionate
desires
,
the
same
strivings
,
the
*NL*
same
failures
,
the
same
weariness
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
writing
the
history
of
unfashionable
families
,
one
is
apt
to
fall
*NL*
into
a
tone
of
emphasis
which
is
very
far
from
being
the
tone
of
good
*NL*
society
,
where
principles
and
beliefs
are
not
only
of
an
extremely
*NL*
moderate
kind
,
but
are
always
presupposed
,
no
subjects
being
eligible
*NL*
but
such
as
can
be
touched
with
a
light
and
graceful
irony
.
But
then
*NL*
good
society
has
its
claret
and
its
velvet
carpets
,
its
*NL*
dinner-engagements
six
weeks
deep
,
its
opera
and
its
faery
ball-rooms
;
*NL*
rides
off
its
_
ennui
_
on
thoroughbred
horses
;
lounges
at
the
club
;
has
*NL*
to
keep
clear
of
crinoline
vortices
;
gets
its
science
done
by
Faraday
,
*NL*
and
its
religion
by
the
superior
clergy
who
are
to
be
met
in
the
best
*NL*
houses
,
--
how
should
it
have
time
or
need
for
belief
and
emphasis
?
But
*NL*
good
society
,
floated
on
gossamer
wings
of
light
irony
,
is
of
very
*NL*
expensive
production
;
requiring
nothing
less
than
a
wide
and
arduous
*NL*
national
life
condensed
in
unfragrant
deafening
factories
,
cramping
*NL*
itself
in
mines
,
sweating
at
furnaces
,
grinding
,
hammering
,
weaving
*NL*
under
more
or
less
oppression
of
carbonic
acid
,
or
else
,
spread
over
*NL*
sheepwalks
,
and
scattered
in
lonely
houses
and
huts
on
the
clayey
or
*NL*
chalky
corn-lands
,
where
the
rainy
days
look
dreary
.
This
wide
*NL*
national
life
is
based
entirely
on
emphasis
,
--
the
emphasis
of
want
,
*NL*
which
urges
it
into
all
the
activities
necessary
for
the
maintenance
*NL*
of
good
society
and
light
irony
;
it
spends
its
heavy
years
often
in
a
*NL*
chill
,
uncarpeted
fashion
,
amidst
family
discord
unsoftened
by
long
*NL*
corridors
.
Under
such
circumstances
,
there
are
many
among
its
myriads
*NL*
of
souls
who
have
absolutely
needed
an
emphatic
belief
,
life
in
this
*NL*
unpleasurable
shape
demanding
some
solution
even
to
unspeculative
*NL*
minds
,
--
just
as
you
inquire
into
the
stuffing
of
your
couch
when
*NL*
anything
galls
you
there
,
whereas
eider-down
and
perfect
French
*NL*
springs
excite
no
question
.
Some
have
an
emphatic
belief
in
alcohol
,
*NL*
and
seek
their
_
ekstasis
_
or
outside
standing-ground
in
gin
;
but
the
*NL*
rest
require
something
that
good
society
calls
``
enthusiasm
,
''
something
*NL*
that
will
present
motives
in
an
entire
absence
of
high
prizes
;
*NL*
something
that
will
give
patience
and
feed
human
love
when
the
limbs
*NL*
ache
with
weariness
,
and
human
looks
are
hard
upon
us
;
something
,
*NL*
clearly
,
that
lies
outside
personal
desires
,
that
includes
resignation
*NL*
for
ourselves
and
active
love
for
what
is
not
ourselves
.
Now
and
then
*NL*
that
sort
of
enthusiasm
finds
a
far-echoing
voice
that
comes
from
an
*NL*
experience
springing
out
of
the
deepest
need
;
and
it
was
by
being
*NL*
brought
within
the
long
lingering
vibrations
of
such
a
voice
that
*NL*
Maggie
,
with
her
girl
's
face
and
unnoted
sorrows
,
found
an
effort
and
*NL*
a
hope
that
helped
her
through
years
of
loneliness
,
making
out
a
faith
*NL*
for
herself
without
the
aid
of
established
authorities
and
appointed
*NL*
guides
;
for
they
were
not
at
hand
,
and
her
need
was
pressing
.
From
*NL*
what
you
know
of
her
,
you
will
not
be
surprised
that
she
threw
some
*NL*
exaggeration
and
wilfulness
,
some
pride
and
impetuosity
,
even
into
her
*NL*
self-renunciation
;
her
own
life
was
still
a
drama
for
her
,
in
which
*NL*
she
demanded
of
herself
that
her
part
should
be
played
with
intensity
.
*NL*
And
so
it
came
to
pass
that
she
often
lost
the
spirit
of
humility
by
*NL*
being
excessive
in
the
outward
act
;
she
often
strove
after
too
high
a
*NL*
flight
,
and
came
down
with
her
poor
little
half-fledged
wings
dabbled
*NL*
in
the
mud
.
For
example
,
she
not
only
determined
to
work
at
plain
*NL*
sewing
,
that
she
might
contribute
something
toward
the
fund
in
the
tin
*NL*
box
,
but
she
went
,
in
the
first
instance
,
in
her
zeal
of
*NL*
self-mortification
,
to
ask
for
it
at
a
linen
shop
in
St.
Ogg
's
,
*NL*
instead
of
getting
it
in
a
more
quiet
and
indirect
way
;
and
could
see
*NL*
nothing
but
what
was
entirely
wrong
and
unkind
,
nay
,
persecuting
,
in
*NL*
Tom
's
reproof
of
her
for
this
unnecessary
act
.
``
I
do
n't
like
_
my
_
*NL*
sister
to
do
such
things
,
''
said
Tom
,
''
_
I
'll
_
take
care
that
the
debts
*NL*
are
paid
,
without
your
lowering
yourself
in
that
way
.
''
Surely
there
*NL*
was
some
tenderness
and
bravery
mingled
with
the
worldliness
and
*NL*
self-assertion
of
that
little
speech
;
but
Maggie
held
it
as
dross
,
*NL*
overlooking
the
grains
of
gold
,
and
took
Tom
's
rebuke
as
one
of
her
*NL*
outward
crosses
.
Tom
was
very
hard
to
her
,
she
used
to
think
,
in
her
*NL*
long
night-watchings
,
--
to
her
who
had
always
loved
him
so
;
and
then
*NL*
she
strove
to
be
contented
with
that
hardness
,
and
to
require
nothing
.
*NL*
That
is
the
path
we
all
like
when
we
set
out
on
our
abandonment
of
*NL*
egoism
,
--
the
path
of
martyrdom
and
endurance
,
where
the
palm-branches
*NL*
grow
,
rather
than
the
steep
highway
of
tolerance
,
just
allowance
,
and
*NL*
self-blame
,
where
there
are
no
leafy
honors
to
be
gathered
and
worn
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
books
,
Virgil
,
Euclid
,
and
Aldrich
--
that
wrinkled
fruit
of
the
*NL*
tree
of
knowledge
--
had
been
all
laid
by
;
for
Maggie
had
turned
her
*NL*
back
on
the
vain
ambition
to
share
the
thoughts
of
the
wise
.
In
her
*NL*
first
ardor
she
flung
away
the
books
with
a
sort
of
triumph
that
she
*NL*
had
risen
above
the
need
of
them
;
and
if
they
had
been
her
own
,
she
*NL*
would
have
burned
them
,
believing
that
she
would
never
repent
.
She
*NL*
read
so
eagerly
and
constantly
in
her
three
books
,
the
Bible
,
Thomas
a
*NL*
Kempis
,
and
the
``
Christian
Year
''
-LRB-
no
longer
rejected
as
a
*NL*
``
hymn-book
''
-RRB-
,
that
they
filled
her
mind
with
a
continual
stream
of
*NL*
rhythmic
memories
;
and
she
was
too
ardently
learning
to
see
all
nature
*NL*
and
life
in
the
light
of
her
new
faith
,
to
need
any
other
material
for
*NL*
her
mind
to
work
on
,
as
she
sat
with
her
well-plied
needle
,
making
*NL*
shirts
and
other
complicated
stitchings
,
falsely
called
``
plain
,
''
--
by
*NL*
no
means
plain
to
Maggie
,
since
wristband
and
sleeve
and
the
like
had
*NL*
a
capability
of
being
sewed
in
wrong
side
outward
in
moments
of
mental
*NL*
wandering
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hanging
diligently
over
her
sewing
,
Maggie
was
a
sight
any
one
might
*NL*
have
been
pleased
to
look
at
.
That
new
inward
life
of
hers
,
*NL*
notwithstanding
some
volcanic
upheavings
of
imprisoned
passions
,
yet
*NL*
shone
out
in
her
face
with
a
tender
soft
light
that
mingled
itself
as
*NL*
added
loveliness
with
the
gradually
enriched
color
and
outline
of
her
*NL*
blossoming
youth
.
Her
mother
felt
the
change
in
her
with
a
sort
of
*NL*
puzzled
wonder
that
Maggie
should
be
``
growing
up
so
good
''
;
it
was
*NL*
amazing
that
this
once
``
contrairy
''
child
was
become
so
submissive
,
so
*NL*
backward
to
assert
her
own
will
.
Maggie
used
to
look
up
from
her
work
*NL*
and
find
her
mother
's
eyes
fixed
upon
her
;
they
were
watching
and
*NL*
waiting
for
the
large
young
glance
,
as
if
her
elder
frame
got
some
*NL*
needful
warmth
from
it
.
The
mother
was
getting
fond
of
her
tall
,
brown
*NL*
girl
,
--
the
only
bit
of
furniture
now
on
which
she
could
bestow
her
*NL*
anxiety
and
pride
;
and
Maggie
,
in
spite
of
her
own
ascetic
wish
to
*NL*
have
no
personal
adornment
,
was
obliged
to
give
way
to
her
mother
*NL*
about
her
hair
,
and
submit
to
have
the
abundant
black
locks
plaited
*NL*
into
a
coronet
on
the
summit
of
her
head
,
after
the
pitiable
fashion
*NL*
of
those
antiquated
times
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
your
mother
have
that
bit
o
'
pleasure
,
my
dear
,
''
said
Mrs.
*NL*
Tulliver
;
``
I
'd
trouble
enough
with
your
hair
once
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
Maggie
,
glad
of
anything
that
would
soothe
her
mother
,
and
cheer
*NL*
their
long
day
together
,
consented
to
the
vain
decoration
,
and
showed
*NL*
a
queenly
head
above
her
old
frocks
,
steadily
refusing
,
however
,
to
*NL*
look
at
herself
in
the
glass
.
Mrs.
Tulliver
liked
to
call
the
father
's
*NL*
attention
to
Maggie
's
hair
and
other
unexpected
virtues
,
but
he
had
a
*NL*
brusk
reply
to
give
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
knew
well
enough
what
she
'd
be
,
before
now
,
--
it
's
nothing
new
to
*NL*
me
.
But
it
's
a
pity
she
is
n't
made
o
'
commoner
stuff
;
she
'll
be
thrown
*NL*
away
,
I
doubt
,
--
there
'll
be
nobody
to
marry
her
as
is
fit
for
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Maggie
's
graces
of
mind
and
body
fed
his
gloom
.
He
sat
patiently
*NL*
enough
while
she
read
him
a
chapter
,
or
said
something
timidly
when
*NL*
they
were
alone
together
about
trouble
being
turned
into
a
blessing
.
*NL*
He
took
it
all
as
part
of
his
daughter
's
goodness
,
which
made
his
*NL*
misfortunes
the
sadder
to
him
because
they
damaged
her
chance
in
life
.
*NL*
In
a
mind
charged
with
an
eager
purpose
and
an
unsatisfied
*NL*
vindictiveness
,
there
is
no
room
for
new
feelings
;
Mr.
Tulliver
did
*NL*
not
want
spiritual
consolation
--
he
wanted
to
shake
off
the
degradation
*NL*
of
debt
,
and
to
have
his
revenge
.

*NL*
*NL*
In
the
Red
Deeps
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
family
sitting-room
was
a
long
room
with
a
window
at
each
end
;
one
*NL*
looking
toward
the
croft
and
along
the
Ripple
to
the
banks
of
the
*NL*
Floss
,
the
other
into
the
mill-yard
.
Maggie
was
sitting
with
her
work
*NL*
against
the
latter
window
when
she
saw
Mr.
Wakem
entering
the
yard
,
as
*NL*
usual
,
on
his
fine
black
horse
;
but
not
alone
,
as
usual
.
Some
one
was
*NL*
with
him
,
--
a
figure
in
a
cloak
,
on
a
handsome
pony
.
Maggie
had
hardly
*NL*
time
to
feel
that
it
was
Philip
come
back
,
before
they
were
in
front
*NL*
of
the
window
,
and
he
was
raising
his
hat
to
her
;
while
his
father
,
*NL*
catching
the
movement
by
a
side-glance
,
looked
sharply
round
at
them
*NL*
both
.
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
hurried
away
from
the
window
and
carried
her
work
upstairs
;
for
*NL*
Mr.
Wakem
sometimes
came
in
and
inspected
the
books
,
and
Maggie
felt
*NL*
that
the
meeting
with
Philip
would
be
robbed
of
all
pleasure
in
the
*NL*
presence
of
the
two
fathers
.
Some
day
,
perhaps
,
she
could
see
him
when
*NL*
they
could
just
shake
hands
,
and
she
could
tell
him
that
she
*NL*
remembered
his
goodness
to
Tom
,
and
the
things
he
had
said
to
her
in
*NL*
the
old
days
,
though
they
could
never
be
friends
any
more
.
It
was
not
*NL*
at
all
agitating
to
Maggie
to
see
Philip
again
;
she
retained
her
*NL*
childish
gratitude
and
pity
toward
him
,
and
remembered
his
cleverness
;
*NL*
and
in
the
early
weeks
of
her
loneliness
she
had
continually
recalled
*NL*
the
image
of
him
among
the
people
who
had
been
kind
to
her
in
life
,
*NL*
often
wishing
she
had
him
for
a
brother
and
a
teacher
,
as
they
had
*NL*
fancied
it
might
have
been
,
in
their
talk
together
.
But
that
sort
of
*NL*
wishing
had
been
banished
along
with
other
dreams
that
savored
of
*NL*
seeking
her
own
will
;
and
she
thought
,
besides
,
that
Philip
might
be
*NL*
altered
by
his
life
abroad
,
--
he
might
have
become
worldly
,
and
really
*NL*
not
care
about
her
saying
anything
to
him
now
.
And
yet
his
face
was
*NL*
wonderfully
little
altered
,
--
it
was
only
a
larger
,
more
manly
copy
of
*NL*
the
pale
,
small-featured
boy
's
face
,
with
the
gray
eyes
,
and
the
*NL*
boyish
waving
brown
hair
;
there
was
the
old
deformity
to
awaken
the
*NL*
old
pity
;
and
after
all
her
meditations
,
Maggie
felt
that
she
really
*NL*
_
should
_
like
to
say
a
few
words
to
him
.
He
might
still
be
melancholy
,
*NL*
as
he
always
used
to
be
,
and
like
her
to
look
at
him
kindly
.
She
*NL*
wondered
if
he
remembered
how
he
used
to
like
her
eyes
;
with
that
*NL*
thought
Maggie
glanced
toward
the
square
looking-glass
which
was
*NL*
condemned
to
hang
with
its
face
toward
the
wall
,
and
she
half
started
*NL*
from
her
seat
to
reach
it
down
;
but
she
checked
herself
and
snatched
*NL*
up
her
work
,
trying
to
repress
the
rising
wishes
by
forcing
her
memory
*NL*
to
recall
snatches
of
hymns
,
until
she
saw
Philip
and
his
father
*NL*
returning
along
the
road
,
and
she
could
go
down
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
far
on
in
June
now
,
and
Maggie
was
inclined
to
lengthen
the
*NL*
daily
walk
which
was
her
one
indulgence
;
but
this
day
and
the
*NL*
following
she
was
so
busy
with
work
which
must
be
finished
that
she
*NL*
never
went
beyond
the
gate
,
and
satisfied
her
need
of
the
open
air
by
*NL*
sitting
out
of
doors
.
One
of
her
frequent
walks
,
when
she
was
not
*NL*
obliged
to
go
to
St.
Ogg
's
,
was
to
a
spot
that
lay
beyond
what
was
*NL*
called
the
``
Hill
,
''
--
an
insignificant
rise
of
ground
crowned
by
trees
,
*NL*
lying
along
the
side
of
the
road
which
ran
by
the
gates
of
Dorlcote
*NL*
Mill
.
Insignificant
I
call
it
,
because
in
height
it
was
hardly
more
*NL*
than
a
bank
;
but
there
may
come
moments
when
Nature
makes
a
mere
bank
*NL*
a
means
toward
a
fateful
result
;
and
that
is
why
I
ask
you
to
imagine
*NL*
this
high
bank
crowned
with
trees
,
making
an
uneven
wall
for
some
*NL*
quarter
of
a
mile
along
the
left
side
of
Dorlcote
Mill
and
the
*NL*
pleasant
fields
behind
it
,
bounded
by
the
murmuring
Ripple
.
Just
where
*NL*
this
line
of
bank
sloped
down
again
to
the
level
,
a
by-road
turned
off
*NL*
and
led
to
the
other
side
of
the
rise
,
where
it
was
broken
into
very
*NL*
capricious
hollows
and
mounds
by
the
working
of
an
exhausted
*NL*
stone-quarry
,
so
long
exhausted
that
both
mounds
and
hollows
were
now
*NL*
clothed
with
brambles
and
trees
,
and
here
and
there
by
a
stretch
of
*NL*
grass
which
a
few
sheep
kept
close-nibbled
.
In
her
childish
days
*NL*
Maggie
held
this
place
,
called
the
Red
Deeps
,
in
very
great
awe
,
and
*NL*
needed
all
her
confidence
in
Tom
's
bravery
to
reconcile
her
to
an
*NL*
excursion
thither
,
--
visions
of
robbers
and
fierce
animals
haunting
*NL*
every
hollow
.
But
now
it
had
the
charm
for
her
which
any
broken
*NL*
ground
,
any
mimic
rock
and
ravine
,
have
for
the
eyes
that
rest
*NL*
habitually
on
the
level
;
especially
in
summer
,
when
she
could
sit
on
a
*NL*
grassy
hollow
under
the
shadow
of
a
branching
ash
,
stooping
aslant
*NL*
from
the
steep
above
her
,
and
listen
to
the
hum
of
insects
,
like
*NL*
tiniest
bells
on
the
garment
of
Silence
,
or
see
the
sunlight
piercing
*NL*
the
distant
boughs
,
as
if
to
chase
and
drive
home
the
truant
heavenly
*NL*
blue
of
the
wild
hyacinths
.
In
this
June
time
,
too
,
the
dog-roses
were
*NL*
in
their
glory
,
and
that
was
an
additional
reason
why
Maggie
should
*NL*
direct
her
walk
to
the
Red
Deeps
,
rather
than
to
any
other
spot
,
on
*NL*
the
first
day
she
was
free
to
wander
at
her
will
,
--
a
pleasure
she
*NL*
loved
so
well
,
that
sometimes
,
in
her
ardors
of
renunciation
,
she
*NL*
thought
she
ought
to
deny
herself
the
frequent
indulgence
in
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
You
may
see
her
now
,
as
she
walks
down
the
favorite
turning
and
enters
*NL*
the
Deeps
by
a
narrow
path
through
a
group
of
Scotch
firs
,
her
tall
*NL*
figure
and
old
lavender
gown
visible
through
an
hereditary
black
silk
*NL*
shawl
of
some
wide-meshed
net-like
material
;
and
now
she
is
sure
of
*NL*
being
unseen
she
takes
off
her
bonnet
and
ties
it
over
her
arm
.
One
*NL*
would
certainly
suppose
her
to
be
farther
on
in
life
than
her
*NL*
seventeenth
year
--
perhaps
because
of
the
slow
resigned
sadness
of
the
*NL*
glance
from
which
all
search
and
unrest
seem
to
have
departed
;
perhaps
*NL*
because
her
broad-chested
figure
has
the
mould
of
early
womanhood
.
*NL*
Youth
and
health
have
withstood
well
the
involuntary
and
voluntary
*NL*
hardships
of
her
lot
,
and
the
nights
in
which
she
has
lain
on
the
hard
*NL*
floor
for
a
penance
have
left
no
obvious
trace
;
the
eyes
are
liquid
,
*NL*
the
brown
cheek
is
firm
and
round
,
the
full
lips
are
red
.
With
her
*NL*
dark
coloring
and
jet
crown
surmounting
her
tall
figure
,
she
seems
to
*NL*
have
a
sort
of
kinship
with
the
grand
Scotch
firs
,
at
which
she
is
*NL*
looking
up
as
if
she
loved
them
well
.
Yet
one
has
a
sense
of
*NL*
uneasiness
in
looking
at
her
,
--
a
sense
of
opposing
elements
,
of
which
*NL*
a
fierce
collision
is
imminent
;
surely
there
is
a
hushed
expression
,
*NL*
such
as
one
often
sees
in
older
faces
under
borderless
caps
,
out
of
*NL*
keeping
with
the
resistant
youth
,
which
one
expects
to
flash
out
in
a
*NL*
sudden
,
passionate
glance
,
that
will
dissipate
all
the
quietude
,
like
*NL*
a
damp
fire
leaping
out
again
when
all
seemed
safe
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Maggie
herself
was
not
uneasy
at
this
moment
.
She
was
calmly
*NL*
enjoying
the
free
air
,
while
she
looked
up
at
the
old
fir-trees
,
and
*NL*
thought
that
those
broken
ends
of
branches
were
the
records
of
past
*NL*
storms
,
which
had
only
made
the
red
stems
soar
higher
.
But
while
her
*NL*
eyes
were
still
turned
upward
,
she
became
conscious
of
a
moving
shadow
*NL*
cast
by
the
evening
sun
on
the
grassy
path
before
her
,
and
looked
down
*NL*
with
a
startled
gesture
to
see
Philip
Wakem
,
who
first
raised
his
hat
,
*NL*
and
then
,
blushing
deeply
,
came
forward
to
her
and
put
out
his
hand
.
*NL*
Maggie
,
too
,
colored
with
surprise
,
which
soon
gave
way
to
pleasure
.
*NL*
She
put
out
her
hand
and
looked
down
at
the
deformed
figure
before
her
*NL*
with
frank
eyes
,
filled
for
the
moment
with
nothing
but
the
memory
of
*NL*
her
child
's
feelings
,
--
a
memory
that
was
always
strong
in
her
.
She
was
*NL*
the
first
to
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
startled
me
,
''
she
said
,
smiling
faintly
;
``
I
never
meet
any
one
*NL*
here
.
How
came
you
to
be
walking
here
?
Did
you
come
to
meet
_
me
?
_
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
impossible
not
to
perceive
that
Maggie
felt
herself
a
child
*NL*
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
did
,
''
said
Philip
,
still
embarrassed
;
``
I
wished
to
see
you
*NL*
very
much
.
I
watched
a
long
while
yesterday
on
the
bank
near
your
*NL*
house
to
see
if
you
would
come
out
,
but
you
never
came
.
Then
I
watched
*NL*
again
to-day
,
and
when
I
saw
the
way
you
took
,
I
kept
you
in
sight
and
*NL*
came
down
the
bank
,
behind
there
.
I
hope
you
will
not
be
displeased
*NL*
with
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Maggie
,
with
simple
seriousness
,
walking
on
as
if
she
meant
*NL*
Philip
to
accompany
her
,
``
I
'm
very
glad
you
came
,
for
I
wished
very
*NL*
much
to
have
an
opportunity
of
speaking
to
you
.
I
've
never
forgotten
*NL*
how
good
you
were
long
ago
to
Tom
,
and
me
too
;
but
I
was
not
sure
that
*NL*
you
would
remember
us
so
well
.
Tom
and
I
have
had
a
great
deal
of
*NL*
trouble
since
then
,
and
I
think
_
that
_
makes
one
think
more
of
what
*NL*
happened
before
the
trouble
came
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
believe
that
you
have
thought
of
me
so
much
as
I
have
thought
*NL*
of
you
,
''
said
Philip
,
timidly
.
``
Do
you
know
,
when
I
was
away
,
I
made
a
*NL*
picture
of
you
as
you
looked
that
morning
in
the
study
when
you
said
*NL*
you
would
not
forget
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Philip
drew
a
large
miniature-case
from
his
pocket
,
and
opened
it
.
*NL*
Maggie
saw
her
old
self
leaning
on
a
table
,
with
her
black
locks
*NL*
hanging
down
behind
her
ears
,
looking
into
space
,
with
strange
,
dreamy
*NL*
eyes
.
It
was
a
water-color
sketch
,
of
real
merit
as
a
portrait
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
dear
,
''
said
Maggie
,
smiling
,
and
flushed
with
pleasure
,
``
what
a
*NL*
queer
little
girl
I
was
!
I
remember
myself
with
my
hair
in
that
way
,
*NL*
in
that
pink
frock
.
I
really
_
was
_
like
a
gypsy
.
I
dare
say
I
am
now
,
''
*NL*
she
added
,
after
a
little
pause
;
``
am
I
like
what
you
expected
me
to
*NL*
be
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
words
might
have
been
those
of
a
coquette
,
but
the
full
,
bright
*NL*
glance
Maggie
turned
on
Philip
was
not
that
of
a
coquette
.
She
really
*NL*
did
hope
he
liked
her
face
as
it
was
now
,
but
it
was
simply
the
rising
*NL*
again
of
her
innate
delight
in
admiration
and
love
.
Philip
met
her
*NL*
eyes
and
looked
at
her
in
silence
for
a
long
moment
,
before
he
said
*NL*
quietly
,
``
No
,
Maggie
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
light
died
out
a
little
from
Maggie
's
face
,
and
there
was
a
slight
*NL*
trembling
of
the
lip
.
Her
eyelids
fell
lower
,
but
she
did
not
turn
*NL*
away
her
head
,
and
Philip
continued
to
look
at
her
.
Then
he
said
*NL*
slowly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
very
much
more
beautiful
than
I
thought
you
would
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Am
I
?
''
said
Maggie
,
the
pleasure
returning
in
a
deeper
flush
.
She
*NL*
turned
her
face
away
from
him
and
took
some
steps
,
looking
straight
*NL*
before
her
in
silence
,
as
if
she
were
adjusting
her
consciousness
to
*NL*
this
new
idea
.
Girls
are
so
accustomed
to
think
of
dress
as
the
main
*NL*
ground
of
vanity
,
that
,
in
abstaining
from
the
looking-glass
,
Maggie
*NL*
had
thought
more
of
abandoning
all
care
for
adornment
than
of
*NL*
renouncing
the
contemplation
of
her
face
.
Comparing
herself
with
*NL*
elegant
,
wealthy
young
ladies
,
it
had
not
occurred
to
her
that
she
*NL*
could
produce
any
effect
with
her
person
.
Philip
seemed
to
like
the
*NL*
silence
well
.
He
walked
by
her
side
,
watching
her
face
,
as
if
that
*NL*
sight
left
no
room
for
any
other
wish
.
They
had
passed
from
among
the
*NL*
fir-trees
,
and
had
now
come
to
a
green
hollow
almost
surrounded
by
an
*NL*
amphitheatre
of
the
pale
pink
dog-roses
.
But
as
the
light
about
them
*NL*
had
brightened
,
Maggie
's
face
had
lost
its
glow
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
stood
still
when
they
were
in
the
hollows
,
and
looking
at
Philip
*NL*
again
,
she
said
in
a
serious
,
sad
voice
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
we
could
have
been
friends
,
--
I
mean
,
if
it
would
have
been
*NL*
good
and
right
for
us
.
But
that
is
the
trial
I
have
to
bear
in
*NL*
everything
;
I
may
not
keep
anything
I
used
to
love
when
I
was
little
.
*NL*
The
old
books
went
;
and
Tom
is
different
,
and
my
father
.
It
is
like
*NL*
death
.
I
must
part
with
everything
I
cared
for
when
I
was
a
child
.
And
*NL*
I
must
part
with
you
;
we
must
never
take
any
notice
of
each
other
*NL*
again
.
That
was
what
I
wanted
to
speak
to
you
for
.
I
wanted
to
let
you
*NL*
know
that
Tom
and
I
ca
n't
do
as
we
like
about
such
things
,
and
that
if
*NL*
I
behave
as
if
I
had
forgotten
all
about
you
,
it
is
not
out
of
envy
or
*NL*
pride
--
or
--
or
any
bad
feeling
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
spoke
with
more
and
more
sorrowful
gentleness
as
she
went
on
,
*NL*
and
her
eyes
began
to
fill
with
tears
.
The
deepening
expression
of
*NL*
pain
on
Philip
's
face
gave
him
a
stronger
resemblance
to
his
boyish
*NL*
self
,
and
made
the
deformity
appeal
more
strongly
to
her
pity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
;
I
see
all
that
you
mean
,
''
he
said
,
in
a
voice
that
had
become
*NL*
feebler
from
discouragement
;
``
I
know
what
there
is
to
keep
us
apart
on
*NL*
both
sides
.
But
it
is
not
right
,
Maggie
,
--
do
n't
you
be
angry
with
me
,
*NL*
I
am
so
used
to
call
you
Maggie
in
my
thoughts
,
--
it
is
not
right
to
*NL*
sacrifice
everything
to
other
people
's
unreasonable
feelings
.
I
would
*NL*
give
up
a
great
deal
for
_
my
_
father
;
but
I
would
not
give
up
a
*NL*
friendship
or
--
or
an
attachment
of
any
sort
,
in
obedience
to
any
wish
*NL*
of
his
that
I
did
n't
recognize
as
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
said
Maggie
,
musingly
.
``
Often
,
when
I
have
been
angry
*NL*
and
discontented
,
it
has
seemed
to
me
that
I
was
not
bound
to
give
up
*NL*
anything
;
and
I
have
gone
on
thinking
till
it
has
seemed
to
me
that
I
*NL*
could
think
away
all
my
duty
.
But
no
good
has
ever
come
of
that
;
it
*NL*
was
an
evil
state
of
mind
.
I
'm
quite
sure
that
whatever
I
might
do
,
I
*NL*
should
wish
in
the
end
that
I
had
gone
without
anything
for
myself
,
*NL*
rather
than
have
made
my
father
's
life
harder
to
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
would
it
make
his
life
harder
if
we
were
to
see
each
other
*NL*
sometimes
?
''
said
Philip
.
He
was
going
to
say
something
else
,
but
*NL*
checked
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
'm
sure
he
would
n't
like
it
.
Do
n't
ask
me
why
,
or
anything
about
*NL*
it
,
''
said
Maggie
,
in
a
distressed
tone
.
``
My
father
feels
so
strongly
*NL*
about
some
things
.
He
is
not
at
all
happy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
more
am
I
,
''
said
Philip
,
impetuously
;
``
I
am
not
happy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
said
Maggie
,
gently
.
``
At
least
--
I
ought
not
to
ask
--
but
I
'm
*NL*
very
,
very
sorry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Philip
turned
to
walk
on
,
as
if
he
had
not
patience
to
stand
still
any
*NL*
longer
,
and
they
went
out
of
the
hollow
,
winding
amongst
the
trees
and
*NL*
bushes
in
silence
.
After
that
last
word
of
Philip
's
,
Maggie
could
not
*NL*
bear
to
insist
immediately
on
their
parting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
been
a
great
deal
happier
,
''
she
said
at
last
,
timidly
,
``
since
I
*NL*
have
given
up
thinking
about
what
is
easy
and
pleasant
,
and
being
*NL*
discontented
because
I
could
n't
have
my
own
will
.
Our
life
is
*NL*
determined
for
us
;
and
it
makes
the
mind
very
free
when
we
give
up
*NL*
wishing
,
and
only
think
of
bearing
what
is
laid
upon
us
,
and
doing
*NL*
what
is
given
us
to
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
ca
n't
give
up
wishing
,
''
said
Philip
,
impatiently
.
``
It
seems
to
*NL*
me
we
can
never
give
up
longing
and
wishing
while
we
are
thoroughly
*NL*
alive
.
There
are
certain
things
we
feel
to
be
beautiful
and
good
,
and
*NL*
we
_
must
_
hunger
after
them
.
How
can
we
ever
be
satisfied
without
them
*NL*
until
our
feelings
are
deadened
?
I
delight
in
fine
pictures
;
I
long
to
*NL*
be
able
to
paint
such
.
I
strive
and
strive
,
and
ca
n't
produce
what
I
*NL*
want
.
That
is
pain
to
me
,
and
always
_
will
_
be
pain
,
until
my
*NL*
faculties
lose
their
keenness
,
like
aged
eyes
.
Then
there
are
many
*NL*
other
things
I
long
for
,
''
--
here
Philip
hesitated
a
little
,
and
then
*NL*
said
,
--
``
things
that
other
men
have
,
and
that
will
always
be
denied
me
.
*NL*
My
life
will
have
nothing
great
or
beautiful
in
it
;
I
would
rather
not
*NL*
have
lived
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Philip
,
''
said
Maggie
,
``
I
wish
you
did
n't
feel
so
.
''
But
her
heart
*NL*
began
to
beat
with
something
of
Philip
's
discontent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
''
said
he
,
turning
quickly
round
and
fixing
his
gray
eyes
*NL*
entreatingly
on
her
face
,
``
I
should
be
contented
to
live
,
if
you
would
*NL*
let
me
see
you
sometimes
.
''
Then
,
checked
by
a
fear
which
her
face
*NL*
suggested
,
he
looked
away
again
and
said
more
calmly
,
``
I
have
no
*NL*
friend
to
whom
I
can
tell
everything
,
no
one
who
cares
enough
about
*NL*
me
;
and
if
I
could
only
see
you
now
and
then
,
and
you
would
let
me
*NL*
talk
to
you
a
little
,
and
show
me
that
you
cared
for
me
,
and
that
we
*NL*
may
always
be
friends
in
heart
,
and
help
each
other
,
then
I
might
come
*NL*
to
be
glad
of
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
how
can
I
see
you
,
Philip
?
''
said
Maggie
,
falteringly
.
-LRB-
Could
she
*NL*
really
do
him
good
?
It
would
be
very
hard
to
say
``
good-by
''
this
day
,
*NL*
and
not
speak
to
him
again
.
Here
was
a
new
interest
to
vary
the
days
;
*NL*
it
was
so
much
easier
to
renounce
the
interest
before
it
came
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
would
let
me
see
you
here
sometimes
,
--
walk
with
you
here
,
--
I
*NL*
would
be
contented
if
it
were
only
once
or
twice
in
a
month
.
_
That
_
*NL*
could
injure
no
one
's
happiness
,
and
it
would
sweeten
my
life
.
*NL*
Besides
,
''
Philip
went
on
,
with
all
the
inventive
astuteness
of
love
at
*NL*
one-and-twenty
,
``
if
there
is
any
enmity
between
those
who
belong
to
*NL*
us
,
we
ought
all
the
more
to
try
and
quench
it
by
our
friendship
;
I
*NL*
mean
,
that
by
our
influence
on
both
sides
we
might
bring
about
a
*NL*
healing
of
the
wounds
that
have
been
made
in
the
past
,
if
I
could
know
*NL*
everything
about
them
.
And
I
do
n't
believe
there
is
any
enmity
in
my
*NL*
own
father
's
mind
;
I
think
he
has
proved
the
contrary
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
shook
her
head
slowly
,
and
was
silent
,
under
conflicting
*NL*
thoughts
.
It
seemed
to
her
inclination
,
that
to
see
Philip
now
and
*NL*
then
,
and
keep
up
the
bond
of
friendship
with
him
,
was
something
not
*NL*
only
innocent
,
but
good
;
perhaps
she
might
really
help
him
to
find
*NL*
contentment
as
she
had
found
it
.
The
voice
that
said
this
made
sweet
*NL*
music
to
Maggie
;
but
athwart
it
there
came
an
urgent
,
monotonous
*NL*
warning
from
another
voice
which
she
had
been
learning
to
obey
,
--
the
*NL*
warning
that
such
interviews
implied
secrecy
;
implied
doing
something
*NL*
she
would
dread
to
be
discovered
in
,
something
that
,
if
discovered
,
*NL*
must
cause
anger
and
pain
;
and
that
the
admission
of
anything
so
near
*NL*
doubleness
would
act
as
a
spiritual
blight
.
Yet
the
music
would
swell
*NL*
out
again
,
like
chimes
borne
onward
by
a
recurrent
breeze
,
persuading
*NL*
her
that
the
wrong
lay
all
in
the
faults
and
weaknesses
of
others
,
and
*NL*
that
there
was
such
a
thing
as
futile
sacrifice
for
one
to
the
injury
*NL*
of
another
.
It
was
very
cruel
for
Philip
that
he
should
be
shrunk
*NL*
from
,
because
of
an
unjustifiable
vindictiveness
toward
his
*NL*
father
,
--
poor
Philip
,
whom
some
people
would
shrink
from
only
because
*NL*
he
was
deformed
.
The
idea
that
he
might
become
her
lover
or
that
her
*NL*
meeting
him
could
cause
disapproval
in
that
light
,
had
not
occurred
to
*NL*
her
;
and
Philip
saw
the
absence
of
this
idea
clearly
enough
,
saw
it
*NL*
with
a
certain
pang
,
although
it
made
her
consent
to
his
request
the
*NL*
less
unlikely
.
There
was
bitterness
to
him
in
the
perception
that
*NL*
Maggie
was
almost
as
frank
and
unconstrained
toward
him
as
when
she
*NL*
was
a
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
say
either
yes
or
no
,
''
she
said
at
last
,
turning
round
and
*NL*
walking
toward
the
way
she
come
;
``
I
must
wait
,
lest
I
should
decide
*NL*
wrongly
.
I
must
seek
for
guidance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
I
come
again
,
then
,
to-morrow
,
or
the
next
day
,
or
next
week
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
had
better
write
,
''
said
Maggie
,
faltering
again
.
``
I
have
to
*NL*
go
to
St.
Ogg
's
sometimes
,
and
I
can
put
the
letter
in
the
post
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
,
''
said
Philip
eagerly
;
``
that
would
not
be
so
well
.
My
father
*NL*
might
see
the
letter
--
and
--
he
has
not
any
enmity
,
I
believe
,
but
he
*NL*
views
things
differently
from
me
;
he
thinks
a
great
deal
about
wealth
*NL*
and
position
.
Pray
let
me
come
here
once
more
.
_
Tell
_
me
when
it
shall
*NL*
be
;
or
if
you
ca
n't
tell
me
,
I
will
come
as
often
as
I
can
till
I
do
*NL*
see
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
it
must
be
so
,
then
,
''
said
Maggie
,
``
for
I
ca
n't
be
quite
*NL*
certain
of
coming
here
any
particular
evening
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
felt
a
great
relief
in
adjourning
the
decision
.
She
was
free
*NL*
now
to
enjoy
the
minutes
of
companionship
;
she
almost
thought
she
*NL*
might
linger
a
little
;
the
next
time
they
met
she
should
have
to
pain
*NL*
Philip
by
telling
him
her
determination
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
help
thinking
,
''
she
said
,
looking
smilingly
at
him
,
after
a
*NL*
few
moments
of
silence
,
``
how
strange
it
is
that
we
should
have
met
and
*NL*
talked
to
each
other
,
just
as
if
it
had
been
only
yesterday
when
we
*NL*
parted
at
Lorton
.
And
yet
we
must
both
be
very
much
altered
in
those
*NL*
five
years
,
--
I
think
it
is
five
years
.
How
was
it
you
seemed
to
have
a
*NL*
sort
of
feeling
that
I
was
the
same
Maggie
?
I
was
not
quite
so
sure
*NL*
that
you
would
be
the
same
;
I
know
you
are
so
clever
,
and
you
must
*NL*
have
seen
and
learnt
so
much
to
fill
your
mind
;
I
was
not
quite
sure
*NL*
you
would
care
about
me
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
never
had
any
doubt
that
you
would
be
the
same
,
whenever
I
*NL*
might
see
you
,
''
said
Philip
,
--
``
I
mean
,
the
same
in
everything
that
made
*NL*
me
like
you
better
than
any
one
else
.
I
do
n't
want
to
explain
that
;
I
*NL*
do
n't
think
any
of
the
strongest
effects
our
natures
are
susceptible
*NL*
of
can
ever
be
explained
.
We
can
neither
detect
the
process
by
which
*NL*
they
are
arrived
at
,
nor
the
mode
in
which
they
act
on
us
.
The
*NL*
greatest
of
painters
only
once
painted
a
mysteriously
divine
child
;
he
*NL*
could
n't
have
told
how
he
did
it
,
and
we
ca
n't
tell
why
we
feel
it
to
*NL*
be
divine
.
I
think
there
are
stores
laid
up
in
our
human
nature
that
*NL*
our
understandings
can
make
no
complete
inventory
of
.
Certain
strains
*NL*
of
music
affect
me
so
strangely
;
I
can
never
hear
them
without
their
*NL*
changing
my
whole
attitude
of
mind
for
a
time
,
and
if
the
effect
would
*NL*
last

might
be
capable
of
heroisms

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
I
know
what
you
mean
about
music
;
_
I
_
feel
so
,
''
said
Maggie
,
*NL*
clasping
her
hands
with
her
old
impetuosity
.
``
At
least
,
''
she
added
,
in
*NL*
a
saddened
tone
,
``
I
used
to
feel
so
when
I
had
any
music
;
I
never
have
*NL*
any
now
except
the
organ
at
church
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
long
for
it
,
Maggie
?
''
said
Philip
,
looking
at
her
with
*NL*
affectionate
pity
.
``
Ah
,
you
can
have
very
little
that
is
beautiful
in
*NL*
your
life
.
Have
you
many
books
?
You
were
so
fond
of
them
when
you
were
*NL*
a
little
girl
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
come
back
to
the
hollow
,
round
which
the
dog-roses
grew
,
and
*NL*
they
both
paused
under
the
charm
of
the
faery
evening
light
,
reflected
*NL*
from
the
pale
pink
clusters
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
have
given
up
books
,
''
said
Maggie
,
quietly
,
``
except
a
very
,
*NL*
very
few
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Philip
had
already
taken
from
his
pocket
a
small
volume
,
and
was
*NL*
looking
at
the
back
as
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
this
is
the
second
volume
,
I
see
,
else
you
might
have
liked
to
*NL*
take
it
home
with
you
.
I
put
it
in
my
pocket
because
I
am
studying
a
*NL*
scene
for
a
picture
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
had
looked
at
the
back
too
,
and
saw
the
title
;
it
revived
an
*NL*
old
impression
with
overmastering
force
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`

'
''
she
said
,
taking
the
book
from
Philip
's
hands
.
``
Oh
,
I
*NL*
began
that
once
;
I
read
to
where
Minna
is
walking
with
Cleveland
,
and
*NL*
I
could
never
get
to
read
the
rest
.
I
went
on
with
it
in
my
own
head
,
*NL*
and
I
made
several
endings
;
but
they
were
all
unhappy
.
I
could
never
*NL*
make
a
happy
ending
out
of
that
beginning
.
Poor
Minna
!
I
wonder
what
*NL*
is
the
real
end
.
For
a
long
while
I
could
n't
get
my
mind
away
from
the
*NL*
Shetland
Isles
,
--
I
used
to
feel
the
wind
blowing
on
me
from
the
rough
*NL*
sea
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
spoke
rapidly
,
with
glistening
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
that
volume
home
with
you
,
Maggie
,
''
said
Philip
,
watching
her
*NL*
with
delight
.
``
I
do
n't
want
it
now
.
I
shall
make
a
picture
of
you
*NL*
instead
,
--
you
,
among
the
Scotch
firs
and
the
slanting
shadows
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
had
not
heard
a
word
he
had
said
;
she
was
absorbed
in
a
page
at
*NL*
which
she
had
opened
.
But
suddenly
she
closed
the
book
,
and
gave
it
*NL*
back
to
Philip
,
shaking
her
head
with
a
backward
movement
,
as
if
to
*NL*
say
``
avaunt
''
to
floating
visions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
keep
it
,
Maggie
,
''
said
Philip
,
entreatingly
;
``
it
will
give
you
*NL*
pleasure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
thank
you
,
''
said
Maggie
,
putting
it
aside
with
her
hand
and
*NL*
walking
on
.
``
It
would
make
me
in
love
with
this
world
again
,
as
I
used
*NL*
to
be
;
it
would
make
me
long
to
see
and
know
many
things
;
it
would
*NL*
make
me
long
for
a
full
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
will
not
always
be
shut
up
in
your
present
lot
;
why
should
*NL*
you
starve
your
mind
in
that
way
?
It
is
narrow
asceticism
;
I
do
n't
*NL*
like
to
see
you
persisting
in
it
,
Maggie
.
Poetry
and
art
and
knowledge
*NL*
are
sacred
and
pure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
not
for
me
,
not
for
me
,
''
said
Maggie
,
walking
more
hurriedly
;
*NL*
``
because
I
should
want
too
much
.
I
must
wait
;
this
life
will
not
last
*NL*
long
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
hurry
away
from
me
without
saying
`
good-by

Maggie
,
''
said
*NL*
Philip
,
as
they
reached
the
group
of
Scotch
firs
,
and
she
continued
*NL*
still
to
walk
along
without
speaking
.
``
I
must
not
go
any
farther
,
I
*NL*
think
,
must
I
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
,
I
forgot
;
good-by
,
''
said
Maggie
,
pausing
,
and
putting
out
her
*NL*
hand
to
him
.
The
action
brought
her
feeling
back
in
a
strong
current
*NL*
to
Philip
;
and
after
they
had
stood
looking
at
each
other
in
silence
*NL*
for
a
few
moments
,
with
their
hands
clasped
,
she
said
,
withdrawing
her
*NL*
hand
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
very
grateful
to
you
for
thinking
of
me
all
those
years
.
It
is
*NL*
very
sweet
to
have
people
love
us
.
What
a
wonderful
,
beautiful
thing
*NL*
it
seems
that
God
should
have
made
your
heart
so
that
you
could
care
*NL*
about
a
queer
little
girl
whom
you
only
knew
for
a
few
weeks
!
I
*NL*
remember
saying
to
you
that
I
thought
you
cared
for
me
more
than
Tom
*NL*
did
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
Maggie
,
''
said
Philip
,
almost
fretfully
,
``
you
would
never
love
me
*NL*
so
well
as
you
love
your
brother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
not
,
''
said
Maggie
,
simply
;
``
but
then
,
you
know
,
the
first
*NL*
thing
I
ever
remember
in
my
life
is
standing
with
Tom
by
the
side
of
*NL*
the
Floss
,
while
he
held
my
hand
;
everything
before
that
is
dark
to
*NL*
me
.
But
I
shall
never
forget
you
,
though
we
must
keep
apart
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
say
so
,
Maggie
,
''
said
Philip
.
``
If
I
kept
that
little
girl
in
my
*NL*
mind
for
five
years
,
did
n't
I
earn
some
part
in
her
?
She
ought
not
to
*NL*
take
herself
quite
away
from
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
if
I
were
free
,
''
said
Maggie
;
``
but
I
am
not
,
I
must
submit
.
''
She
*NL*
hesitated
a
moment
,
and
then
added
,
``
And
I
wanted
to
say
to
you
,
that
*NL*
you
had
better
not
take
more
notice
of
my
brother
than
just
bowing
to
*NL*
him
.
He
once
told
me
not
to
speak
to
you
again
,
and
he
does
n't
change
*NL*
his
mind
--
Oh
dear
,
the
sun
is
set
.
I
am
too
long
away
.
Good-by
.
''
She
*NL*
gave
him
her
hand
once
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
come
here
as
often
as
I
can
till
I
see
you
again
,
Maggie
.
*NL*
Have
some
feeling
for
_
me
_
as
well
as
for
others
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
I
have
,
''
said
Maggie
,
hurrying
away
,
and
quickly
*NL*
disappearing
behind
the
last
fir-tree
;
though
Philip
's
gaze
after
her
*NL*
remained
immovable
for
minutes
as
if
he
saw
her
still
.
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
went
home
,
with
an
inward
conflict
already
begun
;
Philip
went
*NL*
home
to
do
nothing
but
remember
and
hope
.
You
can
hardly
help
blaming
*NL*
him
severely
.
He
was
four
or
five
years
older
than
Maggie
,
and
had
a
*NL*
full
consciousness
of
his
feeling
toward
her
to
aid
him
in
foreseeing
*NL*
the
character
his
contemplated
interviews
with
her
would
bear
in
the
*NL*
opinion
of
a
third
person
.
But
you
must
not
suppose
that
he
was
*NL*
capable
of
a
gross
selfishness
,
or
that
he
could
have
been
satisfied
*NL*
without
persuading
himself
that
he
was
seeking
to
infuse
some
*NL*
happiness
into
Maggie
's
life
,
--
seeking
this
even
more
than
any
direct
*NL*
ends
for
himself
.
He
could
give
her
sympathy
;
he
could
give
her
help
.
*NL*
There
was
not
the
slightest
promise
of
love
toward
him
in
her
manner
;
*NL*
it
was
nothing
more
than
the
sweet
girlish
tenderness
she
had
shown
*NL*
him
when
she
was
twelve
.
Perhaps
she
would
never
love
him
;
perhaps
no
*NL*
woman
ever
_
could
_
love
him
.
Well
,
then
,
he
would
endure
that
;
he
*NL*
should
at
least
have
the
happiness
of
seeing
her
,
of
feeling
some
*NL*
nearness
to
her
.
And
he
clutched
passionately
the
possibility
that
she
*NL*
_
might
_
love
him
;
perhaps
the
feeling
would
grow
,
if
she
could
come
to
*NL*
associate
him
with
that
watchful
tenderness
which
her
nature
would
be
*NL*
so
keenly
alive
to
.
If
any
woman
could
love
him
,
surely
Maggie
was
*NL*
that
woman
;
there
was
such
wealth
of
love
in
her
,
and
there
was
no
one
*NL*
to
claim
it
all
.
Then
,
the
pity
of
it
,
that
a
mind
like
hers
should
be
*NL*
withering
in
its
very
youth
,
like
a
young
forest-tree
,
for
want
of
the
*NL*
light
and
space
it
was
formed
to
flourish
in
!
Could
he
not
hinder
*NL*
that
,
by
persuading
her
out
of
her
system
of
privation
?
He
would
be
*NL*
her
guardian
angel
;
he
would
do
anything
,
bear
anything
,
for
her
*NL*
sake
--
except
not
seeing
her
.

Aunt
Glegg
Learns
the
Breadth

's
Thumb
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
While
Maggie
's
life-struggles
had
lain
almost
entirely
within
her
own
*NL*
soul
,
one
shadowy
army
fighting
another
,
and
the
slain
shadows
forever
*NL*
rising
again
,
Tom
was
engaged
in
a
dustier
,
noisier
warfare
,
grappling
*NL*
with
more
substantial
obstacles
,
and
gaining
more
definite
conquests
.
*NL*
So
it
has
been
since
the
days
of
Hecuba
,
and
of
Hector
,
Tamer
of
*NL*
horses
;
inside
the
gates
,
the
women
with
streaming
hair
and
uplifted
*NL*
hands
offering
prayers
,
watching
the
world
's
combat
from
afar
,
filling
*NL*
their
long
,
empty
days
with
memories
and
fears
;
outside
,
the
men
,
in
*NL*
fierce
struggle
with
things
divine
and
human
,
quenching
memory
in
the
*NL*
stronger
light
of
purpose
,
losing
the
sense
of
dread
and
even
of
*NL*
wounds
in
the
hurrying
ardor
of
action
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
what
you
have
seen
of
Tom
,
I
think
he
is
not
a
youth
of
whom
you
*NL*
would
prophesy
failure
in
anything
he
had
thoroughly
wished
;
the
*NL*
wagers
are
likely
to
be
on
his
side
,
notwithstanding
his
small
success
*NL*
in
the
classics
.
For
Tom
had
never
desired
success
in
this
field
of
*NL*
enterprise
;
and
for
getting
a
fine
flourishing
growth
of
stupidity
*NL*
there
is
nothing
like
pouring
out
on
a
mind
a
good
amount
of
subjects
*NL*
in
which
it
feels
no
interest
.
But
now
Tom
's
strong
will
bound
*NL*
together
his
integrity
,
his
pride
,
his
family
regrets
,
and
his
*NL*
personal
ambition
,
and
made
them
one
force
,
concentrating
his
efforts
*NL*
and
surmounting
discouragements
.
His
uncle
Deane
,
who
watched
him
*NL*
closely
,
soon
began
to
conceive
hopes
of
him
,
and
to
be
rather
proud
*NL*
that
he
had
brought
into
the
employment
of
the
firm
a
nephew
who
*NL*
appeared
to
be
made
of
such
good
commercial
stuff
.
The
real
kindness
*NL*
of
placing
him
in
the
warehouse
first
was
soon
evident
to
Tom
,
in
the
*NL*
hints
his
uncle
began
to
throw
out
,
that
after
a
time
he
might
perhaps
*NL*
be
trusted
to
travel
at
certain
seasons
,
and
buy
in
for
the
firm
*NL*
various
vulgar
commodities
with
which
I
need
not
shock
refined
ears
in
*NL*
this
place
;
and
it
was
doubtless
with
a
view
to
this
result
that
Mr.
*NL*
Deane
,
when
he
expected
to
take
his
wine
alone
,
would
tell
Tom
to
step
*NL*
in
and
sit
with
him
an
hour
,
and
would
pass
that
hour
in
much
*NL*
lecturing
and
catechising
concerning
articles
of
export
and
import
,
*NL*
with
an
occasional
excursus
of
more
indirect
utility
on
the
relative
*NL*
advantages
to
the
merchants
of
St.
Ogg
's
of
having
goods
brought
in
*NL*
their
own
and
in
foreign
bottoms
,
--
a
subject
on
which
Mr.
Deane
,
as
a
*NL*
ship-owner
,
naturally
threw
off
a
few
sparks
when
he
got
warmed
with
*NL*
talk
and
wine
.
*NL*
*NL*
Already
,
in
the
second
year
,
Tom
's
salary
was
raised
;
but
all
,
except
*NL*
the
price
of
his
dinner
and
clothes
,
went
home
into
the
tin
box
;
and
*NL*
he
shunned
comradeship
,
lest
it
should
lead
him
into
expenses
in
spite
*NL*
of
himself
.
Not
that
Tom
was
moulded
on
the
spoony
type
of
the
*NL*
Industrious
Apprentice
;
he
had
a
very
strong
appetite
for
*NL*
pleasure
,
--
would
have
liked
to
be
a
Tamer
of
horses
and
to
make
a
*NL*
distinguished
figure
in
all
neighboring
eyes
,
dispensing
treats
and
*NL*
benefits
to
others
with
well-judged
liberality
,
and
being
pronounced
*NL*
one
of
the
finest
young
fellows
of
those
parts
;
nay
,
he
determined
to
*NL*
achieve
these
things
sooner
or
later
;
but
his
practical
shrewdness
*NL*
told
him
that
the
means
no
such
achievements
could
only
lie
for
him
in
*NL*
present
abstinence
and
self-denial
;
there
were
certain
milestones
to
*NL*
be
passed
,
and
one
of
the
first
was
the
payment
of
his
father
's
debts
.
*NL*
Having
made
up
his
mind
on
that
point
,
he
strode
along
without
*NL*
swerving
,
contracting
some
rather
saturnine
sternness
,
as
a
young
man
*NL*
is
likely
to
do
who
has
a
premature
call
upon
him
for
self-reliance
.
*NL*
Tom
felt
intensely
that
common
cause
with
his
father
which
springs
*NL*
from
family
pride
,
and
was
bent
on
being
irreproachable
as
a
son
;
but
*NL*
his
growing
experience
caused
him
to
pass
much
silent
criticism
on
the
*NL*
rashness
and
imprudence
of
his
father
's
past
conduct
;
their
*NL*
dispositions
were
not
in
sympathy
,
and
Tom
's
face
showed
little
*NL*
radiance
during
his
few
home
hours
.
Maggie
had
an
awe
of
him
,
against
*NL*
which
she
struggled
as
something
unfair
to
her
consciousness
of
wider
*NL*
thoughts
and
deeper
motives
;
but
it
was
of
no
use
to
struggle
.
A
*NL*
character
at
unity
with
itself
--
that
performs
what
it
intends
,
subdues
*NL*
every
counteracting
impulse
,
and
has
no
visions
beyond
the
distinctly
*NL*
possible
--
is
strong
by
its
very
negations
.
*NL*
*NL*
You
may
imagine
that
Tom
's
more
and
more
obvious
unlikeness
to
his
*NL*
father
was
well
fitted
to
conciliate
the
maternal
aunts
and
uncles
;
*NL*
and
Mr.
Deane
's
favorable
reports
and
predictions
to
Mr.
Glegg
*NL*
concerning
Tom
's
qualifications
for
business
began
to
be
discussed
*NL*
amongst
them
with
various
acceptance
.
He
was
likely
,
it
appeared
,
to
*NL*
do
the
family
credit
without
causing
it
any
expense
and
trouble
.
Mrs.
*NL*
Pullet
had
always
thought
it
strange
if
Tom
's
excellent
complexion
,
so
*NL*
entirely
that
of
the
Dodsons
,
did
not
argue
a
certainty
that
he
would
*NL*
turn
out
well
;
his
juvenile
errors
of
running
down
the
peacock
,
and
*NL*
general
disrespect
to
his
aunts
,
only
indicating
a
tinge
of
Tulliver
*NL*
blood
which
he
had
doubtless
outgrown
.
Mr.
Glegg
,
who
had
contracted
a
*NL*
cautious
liking
for
Tom
ever
since
his
spirited
and
sensible
behavior
*NL*
when
the
execution
was
in
the
house
,
was
now
warming
into
a
resolution
*NL*
to
further
his
prospects
actively
,
--
some
time
,
when
an
opportunity
*NL*
offered
of
doing
so
in
a
prudent
manner
,
without
ultimate
loss
;
but
*NL*
Mrs.
Glegg
observed
that
she
was
not
given
to
speak
without
book
,
as
*NL*
some
people
were
;
that
those
who
said
least
were
most
likely
to
find
*NL*
their
words
made
good
;
and
that
when
the
right
moment
came
,
it
would
*NL*
be
seen
who
could
do
something
better
than
talk
.
Uncle
Pullet
,
after
*NL*
silent
meditation
for
a
period
of
several
lozenges
,
came
distinctly
to
*NL*
the
conclusion
,
that
when
a
young
man
was
likely
to
do
well
,
it
was
*NL*
better
not
to
meddle
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
,
meanwhile
,
had
shown
no
disposition
to
rely
on
any
one
but
*NL*
himself
,
though
,
with
a
natural
sensitiveness
toward
all
indications
*NL*
of
favorable
opinion
,
he
was
glad
to
see
his
uncle
Glegg
look
in
on
*NL*
him
sometimes
in
a
friendly
way
during
business
hours
,
and
glad
to
be
*NL*
invited
to
dine
at
his
house
,
though
he
usually
preferred
declining
on
*NL*
the
ground
that
he
was
not
sure
of
being
punctual
.
But
about
a
year
*NL*
ago
,
something
had
occurred
which
induced
Tom
to
test
his
uncle
*NL*
Glegg
's
friendly
disposition
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bob
Jakin
,
who
rarely
returned
from
one
of
his
rounds
without
seeing
*NL*
Tom
and
Maggie
,
awaited
him
on
the
bridge
as
he
was
coming
home
from
*NL*
St.
Ogg
's
one
evening
,
that
they
might
have
a
little
private
talk
.
He
*NL*
took
the
liberty
of
asking
if
Mr.
Tom
had
ever
thought
of
making
money
*NL*
by
trading
a
bit
on
his
own
account
.
Trading
,
how
?
Tom
wished
to
know
.
*NL*
Why
,
by
sending
out
a
bit
of
a
cargo
to
foreign
ports
;
because
Bob
had
*NL*
a
particular
friend
who
had
offered
to
do
a
little
business
for
him
in
*NL*
that
way
in
Laceham
goods
,
and
would
be
glad
to
serve
Mr.
Tom
on
the
*NL*
same
footing
.
Tom
was
interested
at
once
,
and
begged
for
full
*NL*
explanation
,
wondering
he
had
not
thought
of
this
plan
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
so
well
pleased
with
the
prospect
of
a
speculation
that
might
*NL*
change
the
slow
process
of
addition
into
multiplication
,
that
he
at
*NL*
once
determined
to
mention
the
matter
to
his
father
,
and
get
his
*NL*
consent
to
appropriate
some
of
the
savings
in
the
tin
box
to
the
*NL*
purchase
of
a
small
cargo
.
He
would
rather
not
have
consulted
his
*NL*
father
,
but
he
had
just
paid
his
last
quarter
's
money
into
the
tin
*NL*
box
,
and
there
was
no
other
resource
.
All
the
savings
were
there
;
for
*NL*
Mr.
Tulliver
would
not
consent
to
put
the
money
out
at
interest
lest
*NL*
he
should
lose
it
.
Since
he
had
speculated
in
the
purchase
of
some
*NL*
corn
,
and
had
lost
by
it
,
he
could
not
be
easy
without
keeping
the
*NL*
money
under
his
eye
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
approached
the
subject
carefully
,
as
he
was
seated
on
the
hearth
*NL*
with
his
father
that
evening
,
and
Mr.
Tulliver
listened
,
leaning
*NL*
forward
in
his
arm-chair
and
looking
up
in
Tom
's
face
with
a
sceptical
*NL*
glance
.
His
first
impulse
was
to
give
a
positive
refusal
,
but
he
was
*NL*
in
some
awe
of
Tom
's
wishes
,
and
since
he
had
the
sense
of
being
an
*NL*
``
unlucky
''
father
,
he
had
lost
some
of
his
old
peremptoriness
and
*NL*
determination
to
be
master
.
He
took
the
key
of
the
bureau
from
his
*NL*
pocket
,
got
out
the
key
of
the
large
chest
,
and
fetched
down
the
tin
*NL*
box
,
--
slowly
,
as
if
he
were
trying
to
defer
the
moment
of
a
painful
*NL*
parting
.
Then
he
seated
himself
against
the
table
,
and
opened
the
box
*NL*
with
that
little
padlock-key
which
he
fingered
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
*NL*
in
all
vacant
moments
.
There
they
were
,
the
dingy
bank-notes
and
the
*NL*
bright
sovereigns
,
and
he
counted
them
out
on
the
table
--
only
a
*NL*
hundred
and
sixteen
pounds
in
two
years
,
after
all
the
pinching
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
much
do
you
want
,
then
?
''
he
said
,
speaking
as
if
the
words
burnt
*NL*
his
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Suppose
I
begin
with
the
thirty-six
pounds
,
father
?
''
said
Tom
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Tulliver
separated
this
sum
from
the
rest
,
and
keeping
his
hand
*NL*
over
it
,
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
as
much
as
I
can
save
out
o
'
my
pay
in
a
year
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
father
;
it
is
such
slow
work
,
saving
out
of
the
little
money
we
*NL*
get
.
And
in
this
way
we
might
double
our
savings
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
my
lad
,
''
said
the
father
,
keeping
his
hand
on
the
money
,
``
but
you
*NL*
might
lose
it
,
--
you
might
lose
a
year
o
'
my
life
,
--
and
I
have
n't
got
*NL*
many
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
was
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
know
I
would
n't
pay
a
dividend
with
the
first
hundred
,
*NL*
because
I
wanted
to
see
it
all
in
a
lump
,
--
and
when
I
see
it
,
I
'm
sure
*NL*
o
n't
.
If
you
trust
to
luck
,
it
's
sure
to
be
against
me
.
It
's
Old
*NL*
Harry
's
got
the
luck
in
his
hands
;
and
if
I
lose
one
year
,
I
shall
*NL*
never
pick
it
up
again
;
death
`
ull
o'ertake
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Tulliver
's
voice
trembled
,
and
Tom
was
silent
for
a
few
minutes
*NL*
before
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
give
it
up
,
father
,
since
you
object
to
it
so
strongly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
unwilling
to
abandon
the
scheme
altogether
,
he
determined
to
ask
*NL*
his
uncle
Glegg
to
venture
twenty
pounds
,
on
condition
of
receiving
*NL*
five
per
cent
.
of
the
profits
.
That
was
really
a
very
small
thing
to
*NL*
ask
.
So
when
Bob
called
the
next
day
at
the
wharf
to
know
the
*NL*
decision
,
Tom
proposed
that
they
should
go
together
to
his
uncle
*NL*
Glegg
's
to
open
the
business
;
for
his
diffident
pride
clung
to
him
,
*NL*
and
made
him
feel
that
Bobs
'
tongue
would
relieve
him
from
some
*NL*
embarrassment
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Glegg
,
at
the
pleasant
hour
of
four
in
the
afternoon
of
a
hot
*NL*
August
day
,
was
naturally
counting
his
wall-fruit
to
assure
himself
*NL*
that
the
sum
total
had
not
varied
since
yesterday
.
To
him
entered
Tom
,
*NL*
in
what
appeared
to
Mr.
Glegg
very
questionable
companionship
,
--
that
*NL*
of
a
man
with
a
pack
on
his
back
,
--
for
Bob
was
equipped
for
a
new
*NL*
journey
,
--
and
of
a
huge
brindled
bull-terrier
,
who
walked
with
a
slow
,
*NL*
swaying
movement
from
side
to
side
,
and
glanced
from
under
his
*NL*
eye-lids
with
a
surly
indifference
which
might
after
all
be
a
cover
to
*NL*
the
most
offensive
designs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Glegg
's
spectacles
,
which
had
been
assisting
him
in
counting
the
*NL*
fruit
,
made
these
suspicious
details
alarmingly
evident
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Heigh
!
heigh
!
keep
that
dog
back
,
will
you
?
''
he
shouted
,
snatching
up
*NL*
a
stake
and
holding
it
before
him
as
a
shield
when
the
visitors
were
*NL*
within
three
yards
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Get
out
wi
'
you
,
Mumps
,
''
said
Bob
,
with
a
kick
.
``
He
's
as
quiet
as
a
*NL*
lamb
,
sir
,
''
--
an
observation
which
Mumps
corroborated
by
a
low
growl
as
*NL*
he
retreated
behind
his
master
's
legs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
what
ever
does
this
mean
,
Tom
?
''
said
Mr.
Glegg
.
``
Have
you
*NL*
brought
information
about
the
scoundrels
as
cut
my
trees
?
''
If
Bob
came
*NL*
in
the
character
of
``
information
,
''
Mr.
Glegg
saw
reasons
for
*NL*
tolerating
some
irregularity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
,
''
said
Tom
;
``
I
came
to
speak
to
you
about
a
little
matter
of
*NL*
business
of
my
own
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
--
well
;
but
what
has
this
dog
got
to
do
with
it
?
''
said
the
old
*NL*
gentleman
,
getting
mild
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
my
dog
,
sir
,
''
said
the
ready
Bob
.
``
An
'
it
's
me
as
put
Mr.
Tom
up

sending

*NL*
Uncle
Glegg
stood
open-mouthed
with
astonishment
at
this
unembarrassed
*NL*
loquacity
,
with
which
his
understanding
could
hardly
keep
pace
.
He
*NL*
looked
at
Bob
,
first
over
his
spectacles
,
then
through
them
,
then
over
*NL*
them
again
;
while
Tom
,
doubtful
of
his
uncle
's
impression
,
began
to
*NL*
wish
he
had
not
brought
this
singular
Aaron

Bob

talk
*NL*
appeared
less
seemly

some

it

*NL*
*NL*
``

spoke
more

in
anger

added
:

*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

coloring

``

my

unwilling

I

If
I
could
get
twenty

thirty
pounds
*NL*
to
begin
with
,
I
could
pay
five
per
cent
for
it
,

then
I
could
*NL*
gradually
make
a
little
capital
of
my

do
without
a
loan

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay

Mr.

it

*NL*
``
No

rather
indignantly

``

concluded
Mrs.
Glegg
,
*NL*
turning
impressively
to
her
nephew
,
``

bear

I

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you

''
said
Tom
,
rather
proudly
.
``
I
prefer
having
the
*NL*
money
only
lent
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
;
that
's
the
Dodson
sperrit
,
''
said
Mrs.
Glegg
,
rising
to
get
*NL*
her
knitting
with
the
sense
that
any
further
remark
after
this
would
*NL*
be
bathos
.
*NL*
*NL*
Salt
--
that
eminently
``
briny
chap
''
--
having
been
discovered
in
a
cloud
*NL*
of
tobacco-smoke
at
the
Anchor
Tavern
,
Mr.
Glegg
commenced
inquiries
*NL*
which
turned
out
satisfactorily
enough
to
warrant
the
advance
of
the
*NL*
``
nest-egg
,
''
to
which
aunt
Glegg
contributed
twenty
pounds
;
and
in
this
*NL*
modest
beginning
you
see
the
ground
of
a
fact
which
might
otherwise
*NL*
surprise
you
;
namely
,
Tom
's
accumulation
of
a
fund
,
unknown
to
his
*NL*
father
,
that
promised
in
no
very
long
time
to
meet
the
more
tardy
*NL*
process
of
saving
,
and
quite
cover
the
deficit
.
When
once
his
*NL*
attention
had
been
turned
to
this
source
of
gain
,
Tom
determined
to
*NL*
make
the
most
of
it
,
and
lost
no
opportunity
of
obtaining
information
*NL*
and
extending
his
small
enterprises
.
In
not
telling
his
father
,
he
was
*NL*
influenced
by
that
strange
mixture
of
opposite
feelings
which
often
*NL*
gives
equal
truth
to
those
who
blame
an
action
and
those
who
admire
*NL*
it
,
--
partly
,
it
was
that
disinclination
to
confidence
which
is
seen
*NL*
between
near
kindred
,
that
family
repulsion
which
spoils
the
most
*NL*
sacred
relations
of
our
lives
;
partly
,
it
was
the
desire
to
surprise
*NL*
his
father
with
a
great
joy
.
He
did
not
see
that
it
would
have
been
*NL*
better
to
soothe
the
interval
with
a
new
hope
,
and
prevent
the
*NL*
delirium
of
a
too
sudden
elation
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
time
of
Maggie
's
first
meeting
with
Philip
,
Tom
had
already
*NL*
nearly
a
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
of
his
own
capital
;
and
while
they
*NL*
were
walking
by
the
evening
light
in
the
Red
Deeps
,
he
,
by
the
same
*NL*
evening
light
,
was
riding
into
Laceham
,
proud
of
being
on
his
first
*NL*
journey
on
behalf
of
Guest
&
Co.
,
and
revolving
in
his
mind
all
the
*NL*
chances
that
by
the
end
of
another
year
he
should
have
doubled
his
*NL*
gains
,
lifted
off
the
obloquy
of
debt
from
his
father
's
name
,
and
*NL*
perhaps
--
for
he
should
be
twenty-one
--
have
got
a
new
start
for
*NL*
himself
,
on
a
higher
platform
of
employment
.
Did
he
not
desire
it
?
He
*NL*
was
quite
sure
that
he
did
.

Chapter

*NL*
*NL*
The
Wavering
Balance
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
said
that
Maggie
went
home
that
evening
from
the
Red
Deeps
with
a
*NL*
mental
conflict
already
begun
.
You
have
seen
clearly
enough
,
in
her
*NL*
interview
with
Philip
,
what
that
conflict
was
.
Here
suddenly
was
an
*NL*
opening
in
the
rocky
wall
which
shut
in
the
narrow
valley
of
*NL*
humiliation
,
where
all
her
prospect
was
the
remote
,
unfathomed
sky
;
*NL*
and
some
of
the
memory-haunting
earthly
delights
were
no
longer
out
of
*NL*
her
reach
.
She
might
have
books
,
converse
,
affection
;
she
might
hear
*NL*
tidings
of
the
world
from
which
her
mind
had
not
yet
lost
its
sense
of
*NL*
exile
;
and
it
would
be
a
kindness
to
Philip
too
,
who
was
*NL*
pitiable
,
--
clearly
not
happy
.
And
perhaps
here
was
an
opportunity
*NL*
indicated
for
making
her
mind
more
worthy
of
its
highest
service
;
*NL*
perhaps
the
noblest
,
completest
devoutness
could
hardly
exist
without
*NL*
some
width
of
knowledge
;
_
must
_
she
always
live
in
this
resigned
*NL*
imprisonment
?
It
was
so
blameless
,
so
good
a
thing
that
there
should
*NL*
be
friendship
between
her
and
Philip
;
the
motives
that
forbade
it
were
*NL*
so
unreasonable
,
so
unchristian
!
But
the
severe
monotonous
warning
*NL*
came
again
and
again
,
--
that
she
was
losing
the
simplicity
and
*NL*
clearness
of
her
life
by
admitting
a
ground
of
concealment
;
and
that
,
*NL*
by
forsaking
the
simple
rule
of
renunciation
,
she
was
throwing
herself
*NL*
under
the
seductive
guidance
of
illimitable
wants
.
She
thought
she
had
*NL*
won
strength
to
obey
the
warning
before
she
allowed
herself
the
next
*NL*
week
to
turn
her
steps
in
the
evening
to
the
Red
Deeps
.
But
while
she
*NL*
was
resolved
to
say
an
affectionate
farewell
to
Philip
,
how
she
looked
*NL*
forward
to
that
evening
walk
in
the
still
,
fleckered
shade
of
the
*NL*
hollows
,
away
from
all
that
was
harsh
and
unlovely
;
to
the
*NL*
affectionate
,
admiring
looks
that
would
meet
her
;
to
the
sense
of
*NL*
comradeship
that
childish
memories
would
give
to
wiser
,
older
talk
;
to
*NL*
the
certainty
that
Philip
would
care
to
hear
everything
she
said
,
*NL*
which
no
one
else
cared
for
!
It
was
a
half-hour
that
it
would
be
very
*NL*
hard
to
turn
her
back
upon
,
with
the
sense
that
there
would
be
no
*NL*
other
like
it
.
Yet
she
said
what
she
meant
to
say
;
she
looked
firm
as
*NL*
well
as
sad
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Philip
,
I
have
made
up
my
mind
;
it
is
right
that
we
should
give
each
*NL*
other
up
,
in
everything
but
memory
.
I
could
not
see
you
without
*NL*
concealment
--
stay
,
I
know
what
you
are
going
to
say
,
--
it
is
other
*NL*
people
's
wrong
feelings
that
make
concealment
necessary
;
but
*NL*
concealment
is
bad
,
however
it
may
be
caused
.
I
feel
that
it
would
be
*NL*
bad
for
me
,
for
us
both
.
And
then
,
if
our
secret
were
discovered
,
*NL*
there
would
be
nothing
but
misery
,
--
dreadful
anger
;
and
then
we
must
*NL*
part
after
all
,
and
it
would
be
harder
,
when
we
were
used
to
seeing
*NL*
each
other
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Philip
's
face
had
flushed
,
and
there
was
a
momentary
eagerness
of
*NL*
expression
,
as
if
he
had
been
about
to
resist
this
decision
with
all
*NL*
his
might
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
controlled
himself
,
and
said
,
with
assumed
calmness
:
``
Well
,
*NL*
Maggie
,
if
we
must
part
,
let
us
try
and
forget
it
for
one
half
hour
;
*NL*
let
us
talk
together
a
little
while
,
for
the
last
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
her
hand
,
and
Maggie
felt
no
reason
to
withdraw
it
;
his
*NL*
quietness
made
her
all
the
more
sure
she
had
given
him
great
pain
,
and
*NL*
she
wanted
to
show
him
how
unwillingly
she
had
given
it
.
They
walked
*NL*
together
hand
in
hand
in
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
sit
down
in
the
hollow
,
''
said
Philip
,
``
where
we
stood
the
last
*NL*
time
.
See
how
the
dog-roses
have
strewed
the
ground
,
and
spread
their
*NL*
opal
petals
over
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
sat
down
at
the
roots
of
the
slanting
ash
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
begun
my
picture
of
you
among
the
Scotch
firs
,
Maggie
,
''
said
*NL*
Philip
,
``
so
you
must
let
me
study
your
face
a
little
,
while
you
*NL*
stay
,
--
since
I
am
not
to
see
it
again
.
Please
turn
your
head
this
*NL*
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
said
in
an
entreating
voice
,
and
it
would
have
been
very
hard
*NL*
of
Maggie
to
refuse
.
The
full
,
lustrous
face
,
with
the
bright
black
*NL*
coronet
,
looked
down
like
that
of
a
divinity
well
pleased
to
be
*NL*
worshipped
,
on
the
pale-hued
,
small-featured
face
that
was
turned
up
*NL*
to
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
be
sitting
for
my
second
portrait
then
,
''
she
said
,
smiling
.
*NL*
``
Will
it
be
larger
than
the
other
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
,
much
larger
.
It
is
an
oil-painting
.
You
will
look
like
a
tall
*NL*
Hamadryad
,
dark
and
strong
and
noble
,
just
issued
from
one
of
the
*NL*
fir-trees
,
when
the
stems
are
casting
their
afternoon
shadows
on
the
*NL*
grass
.

``
You
seem
to
think
more
of
painting
than
of
anything
now
,
Philip
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
I
do
,
''
said
Philip
,
rather
sadly
;
``
but
I
think
of
too
many
*NL*
things
,
--
sow
all
sorts
of
seeds
,
and
get
no
great
harvest
from
any
one
*NL*
of
them
.
I
'm
cursed
with
susceptibility
in
every
direction
,
and
*NL*
effective
faculty
in
none
.
I
care
for
painting
and
music
;
I
care
for
*NL*
classic
literature
,
and
mediaeval
literature
,
and
modern
literature
;
I
*NL*
flutter
all
ways
,
and
fly
in
none
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
surely
that
is
a
happiness
to
have
so
many
tastes
,
--
to
enjoy
so
*NL*
many
beautiful
things
,
when
they
are
within
your
reach
,
''
said
Maggie
,
*NL*
musingly
.
``
It
always
seemed
to
me
a
sort
of
clever
stupidity
only
to
*NL*
have
one
sort
of
talent
,
--
almost
like
a
carrier-pigeon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
might
be
a
happiness
to
have
many
tastes
if
I
were
like
other
*NL*
men
,
''
said
Philip
,
bitterly
.
``
I
might
get
some
power
and
distinction
*NL*
by
mere
mediocrity
,
as
they
do
;
at
least
I
should
get
those
middling
*NL*
satisfactions
which
make
men
contented
to
do
without
great
ones
.
I
*NL*
might
think
society
at
St.
Ogg
's
agreeable
then
.
But
nothing
could
*NL*
make
life
worth
the
purchase-money
of
pain
to
me
,
but
some
faculty
*NL*
that
would
lift
me
above
the
dead
level
of
provincial
existence
.
Yes
,
*NL*
there
is
one
thing
,
--
a
passion
answers
as
well
as
a
faculty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
did
not
hear
the
last
words
;
she
was
struggling
against
the
*NL*
consciousness
that
Philip
's
words
had
set
her
own
discontent
vibrating
*NL*
again
as
it
used
to
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
understand
what
you
mean
,
''
she
said
,
``
though
I
know
so
much
less
*NL*
than
you
do
.
I
used
to
think
I
could
never
bear
life
if
it
kept
on
*NL*
being
the
same
every
day
,
and
I
must
always
be
doing
things
of
no
*NL*
consequence
,
and
never
know
anything
greater
.
But
,
dear
Philip
,
I
*NL*
think
we
are
only
like
children
that
some
one
who
is
wiser
is
taking
*NL*
care
of
.
Is
it
not
right
to
resign
ourselves
entirely
,
whatever
may
be
*NL*
denied
us
?
I
have
found
great
peace
in
that
for
the
last
two
or
three
*NL*
years
,
even
joy
in
subduing
my
own
will
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Maggie
,
''
said
Philip
,
vehemently
;
``
and
you
are
shutting
yourself
*NL*
up
in
a
narrow
,
self-delusive
fanaticism
,
which
is
only
a
way
of
*NL*
escaping
pain
by
starving
into
dulness
all
the
highest
powers
of
your
*NL*
nature
.
Joy
and
peace
are
not
resignation
;
resignation
is
the
willing
*NL*
endurance
of
a
pain
that
is
not
allayed
,
that
you
do
n't
expect
to
be
*NL*
allayed
.
Stupefaction
is
not
resignation
;
and
it
is
stupefaction
to
*NL*
remain
in
ignorance
,
--
to
shut
up
all
the
avenues
by
which
the
life
of
*NL*
your
fellow-men
might
become
known
to
you
.
I
am
not
resigned
;
I
am
not
*NL*
sure
that
life
is
long
enough
to
learn
that
lesson
.
_
You
_
are
not
*NL*
resigned
;
you
are
only
trying
to
stupefy
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
's
lips
trembled
;
she
felt
there
was
some
truth
in
what
Philip
*NL*
said
,
and
yet
there
was
a
deeper
consciousness
that
,
for
any
immediate
*NL*
application
it
had
to
her
conduct
,
it
was
no
better
than
falsity
.
Her
*NL*
double
impression
corresponded
to
the
double
impulse
of
the
speaker
.
*NL*
Philip
seriously
believed
what
he
said
,
but
he
said
it
with
vehemence
*NL*
because
it
made
an
argument
against
the
resolution
that
opposed
his
*NL*
wishes
.
But
Maggie
's
face
,
made
more
childlike
by
the
gathering
tears
,
*NL*
touched
him
with
a
tenderer
,
less
egotistic
feeling
.
He
took
her
hand
*NL*
and
said
gently
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
let
us
think
of
such
things
in
this
short
half-hour
,
Maggie
.
Let
*NL*
us
only
care
about
being
together
.
We
shall
be
friends
in
spite
of
*NL*
separation
.
We
shall
always
think
of
each
other
.
I
shall
be
glad
to
*NL*
live
as
long
as
you
are
alive
,
because
I
shall
think
there
may
always
*NL*
come
a
time
when
I
can
--
when
you
will
let
me
help
you
in
some
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
dear
,
good
brother
you
would
have
been
,
Philip
,
''
said
Maggie
,
*NL*
smiling
through
the
haze
of
tears
.
``
I
think
you
would
have
made
as
*NL*
much
fuss
about
me
,
and
been
as
pleased
for
me
to
love
you
,
as
would
*NL*
have
satisfied
even
me
.
You
would
have
loved
me
well
enough
to
bear
*NL*
with
me
,
and
forgive
me
everything
.
That
was
what
I
always
longed
that
*NL*
Tom
should
do
.
I
was
never
satisfied
with
a
_
little
_
of
anything
.
That
*NL*
is
why
it
is
better
for
me
to
do
without
earthly
happiness
altogether
.
*NL*
I
never
felt
that
I
had
enough
music
,
--
I
wanted
more
instruments
*NL*
playing
together
;
I
wanted
voices
to
be
fuller
and
deeper
.
Do
you
ever
*NL*
sing
now
,
Philip
?
''
she
added
abruptly
,
as
if
she
had
forgotten
what
*NL*
went
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
he
said
,
``
every
day
,
almost
.
But
my
voice
is
only
middling
,
*NL*
like
everything
else
in
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
sing
me
something
,
--
just
one
song
.
I
_
may
_
listen
to
that
before
*NL*
I
go
,
--
something
you
used
to
sing
at
Lorton
on
a
Saturday
afternoon
,
*NL*
when
we
had
the
drawing-room
all
to
ourselves
,
and
I
put
my
apron
over
*NL*
my
head
to
listen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
I
_
know
,
''
said
Philip
;
and
Maggie
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
while
*NL*
he
sang
_
sotto
voce
_
,
``
Love
in
her
eyes
sits
playing
,
''
and
then
said
,
*NL*
``
That
's
it
,
is
n't
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
,
I
wo
n't
stay
,
''
said
Maggie
,
starting
up
.
``
It
will
only
haunt
*NL*
me
.
Let
us
walk
,
Philip
.
I
must
go
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
moved
away
,
so
that
he
was
obliged
to
rise
and
follow
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Maggie
,
''
he
said
,
in
a
tone
of
remonstrance
,
``
do
n't
persist
in
this
*NL*
wilful
,
senseless
privation
.
It
makes
me
wretched
to
see
you
benumbing
*NL*
and
cramping
your
nature
in
this
way
.
You
were
so
full
of
life
when
*NL*
you
were
a
child
;
I
thought
you
would
be
a
brilliant
woman
,
--
all
wit
*NL*
and
bright
imagination
.
And
it
flashes
out
in
your
face
still
,
until
*NL*
you
draw
that
veil
of
dull
quiescence
over
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
you
speak
so
bitterly
to
me
,
Philip
?
''
said
Maggie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
I
foresee
it
will
not
end
well
;
you
can
never
carry
on
this
*NL*
self-torture
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
have
strength
given
me
,
''
said
Maggie
,
tremulously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
you
will
not
,
Maggie
;
no
one
has
strength
given
to
do
what
is
*NL*
unnatural
.
It
is
mere
cowardice
to
seek
safety
in
negations
.
No
*NL*
character
becomes
strong
in
that
way
.
You
will
be
thrown
into
the
*NL*
world
some
day
,
and
then
every
rational
satisfaction
of
your
nature
*NL*
that
you
deny
now
will
assault
you
like
a
savage
appetite
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
started
and
paused
,
looking
at
Philip
with
alarm
in
her
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Philip
,
how
dare
you
shake
me
in
this
way
?
You
are
a
tempter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
am
not
;
but
love
gives
insight
,
Maggie
,
and
insight
often
gives
*NL*
foreboding
.
_
Listen
_
to
me
,
--
let
_
me
_
supply
you
with
books
;
do
let
me
*NL*
see
you
sometimes
,
--
be
your
brother
and
teacher
,
as
you
said
at
*NL*
Lorton
.
It
is
less
wrong
that
you
should
see
me
than
that
you
should
*NL*
be
committing
this
long
suicide
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
felt
unable
to
speak
.
She
shook
her
head
and
walked
on
in
*NL*
silence
,
till
they
came
to
the
end
of
the
Scotch
firs
,
and
she
put
out
*NL*
her
hand
in
sign
of
parting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
banish
me
from
this
place
forever
,
then
,
Maggie
?
Surely
I
may
*NL*
come
and
walk
in
it
sometimes
?
If
I
meet
you
by
chance
,
there
is
no
*NL*
concealment
in
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
the
moment
when
our
resolution
seems
about
to
become
*NL*
irrevocable
--
when
the
fatal
iron
gates
are
about
to
close
upon
*NL*
us
--
that
tests
our
strength
.
Then
,
after
hours
of
clear
reasoning
and
*NL*
firm
conviction
,
we
snatch
at
any
sophistry
that
will
nullify
our
long
*NL*
struggles
,
and
bring
us
the
defeat
that
we
love
better
than
victory
.
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
felt
her
heart
leap
at
this
subterfuge
of
Philip
's
,
and
there
*NL*
passed
over
her
face
that
almost
imperceptible
shock
which
accompanies
*NL*
any
relief
.
He
saw
it
,
and
they
parted
in
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Philip
's
sense
of
the
situation
was
too
complete
for
him
not
to
be
*NL*
visited
with
glancing
fears
lest
he
had
been
intervening
too
*NL*
presumptuously
in
the
action
of
Maggie
's
conscience
,
perhaps
for
a
*NL*
selfish
end
.
But
no
!
--
he
persuaded
himself
his
end
was
not
selfish
.
He
*NL*
had
little
hope
that
Maggie
would
ever
return
the
strong
feeling
he
*NL*
had
for
her
;
and
it
must
be
better
for
Maggie
's
future
life
,
when
*NL*
these
petty
family
obstacles
to
her
freedom
had
disappeared
,
that
the
*NL*
present
should
not
be
entirely
sacrificed
,
and
that
she
should
have
*NL*
some
opportunity
of
culture
,
--
some
interchange
with
a
mind
above
the
*NL*
vulgar
level
of
those
she
was
now
condemned
to
live
with
.
If
we
only
*NL*
look
far
enough
off
for
the
consequence
of
our
actions
,
we
can
always
*NL*
find
some
point
in
the
combination
of
results
by
which
those
actions
*NL*
can
be
justified
;
by
adopting
the
point
of
view
of
a
Providence
who
*NL*
arranges
results
,
or
of
a
philosopher
who
traces
them
,
we
shall
find
*NL*
it
possible
to
obtain
perfect
complacency
in
choosing
to
do
what
is
*NL*
most
agreeable
to
us
in
the
present
moment
.
And
it
was
in
this
way
*NL*
that
Philip
justified
his
subtle
efforts
to
overcome
Maggie
's
true
*NL*
prompting
against
a
concealment
that
would
introduce
doubleness
into
*NL*
her
own
mind
,
and
might
cause
new
misery
to
those
who
had
the
primary
*NL*
natural
claim
on
her
.
But
there
was
a
surplus
of
passion
in
him
that
*NL*
made
him
half
independent
of
justifying
motives
.
His
longing
to
see
*NL*
Maggie
,
and
make
an
element
in
her
life
,
had
in
it
some
of
that
savage
*NL*
impulse
to
snatch
an
offered
joy
which
springs
from
a
life
in
which
*NL*
the
mental
and
bodily
constitution
have
made
pain
predominate
.
He
had
*NL*
not
his
full
share
in
the
common
good
of
men
;
he
could
not
even
pass
*NL*
muster
with
the
insignificant
,
but
must
be
singled
out
for
pity
,
and
*NL*
excepted
from
what
was
a
matter
of
course
with
others
.
Even
to
Maggie
*NL*
he
was
an
exception
;
it
was
clear
that
the
thought
of
his
being
her
*NL*
lover
had
never
entered
her
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
Do
not
think
too
hardly
of
Philip
.
Ugly
and
deformed
people
have
great
*NL*
need
of
unusual
virtues
,
because
they
are
likely
to
be
extremely
*NL*
uncomfortable
without
them
;
but
the
theory
that
unusual
virtues
spring
*NL*
by
a
direct
consequence
out
of
personal
disadvantages
,
as
animals
get
*NL*
thicker
wool
in
severe
climates
,
is
perhaps
a
little
overstrained
.
The
*NL*
temptations
of
beauty
are
much
dwelt
upon
,
but
I
fancy
they
only
bear
*NL*
the
same
relation
to
those
of
ugliness
,
as
the
temptation
to
excess
at
*NL*
a
feast
,
where
the
delights
are
varied
for
eye
and
ear
as
well
as
*NL*
palate
,
bears
to
the
temptations
that
assail
the
desperation
of
*NL*
hunger
.
Does
not
the
Hunger
Tower
stand
as
the
type
of
the
utmost
*NL*
trial
to
what
is
human
in
us
?
*NL*
*NL*
Philip
had
never
been
soothed
by
that
mother
's
love
which
flows
out
to
*NL*
us
in
the
greater
abundance
because
our
need
is
greater
,
which
clings
*NL*
to
us
the
more
tenderly
because
we
are
the
less
likely
to
be
winners
*NL*
in
the
game
of
life
;
and
the
sense
of
his
father
's
affection
and
*NL*
indulgence
toward
him
was
marred
by
the
keener
perception
of
his
*NL*
father
's
faults
.
Kept
aloof
from
all
practical
life
as
Philip
had
*NL*
been
,
and
by
nature
half
feminine
in
sensitiveness
,
he
had
some
of
the
*NL*
woman
's
intolerant
repulsion
toward
worldliness
and
the
deliberate
*NL*
pursuit
of
sensual
enjoyment
;
and
this
one
strong
natural
tie
in
his
*NL*
life
,
--
his
relation
as
a
son
,
--
was
like
an
aching
limb
to
him
.
Perhaps
*NL*
there
is
inevitably
something
morbid
in
a
human
being
who
is
in
any
*NL*
way
unfavorably
excepted
from
ordinary
conditions
,
until
the
good
*NL*
force
has
had
time
to
triumph
;
and
it
has
rarely
had
time
for
that
at
*NL*
two-and-twenty
.
That
force
was
present
in
Philip
in
much
strength
,
but
*NL*
the
sun
himself
looks
feeble
through
the
morning
mists
.

entering
the
Red
Deeps
through
the
group
of
Scotch
firs
.
But
it
is
*NL*
early
afternoon
and
not
evening
,
and
the
edge
of
sharpness
in
the
*NL*
spring
air
makes
her
draw
her
large
shawl
close
about
her
and
trip
*NL*
along
rather
quickly
;
though
she
looks
round
,
as
usual
,
that
she
may
*NL*
take
in
the
sight
of
her
beloved
trees
.
There
is
a
more
eager
,
*NL*
inquiring
look
in
her
eyes
than
there
was
last
June
,
and
a
smile
is
*NL*
hovering
about
her
lips
,
as
if
some
playful
speech
were
awaiting
the
*NL*
right
hearer
.
The
hearer
was
not
long
in
appearing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
back
your
_
Corinne
_
,
''
said
Maggie
,
drawing
a
book
from
under
her
*NL*
shawl
.
``
You
were
right
in
telling
me
she
would
do
me
no
good
;
but
you
*NL*
were
wrong
in
thinking
I
should
wish
to
be
like
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
n't
you
really
like
to
be
a
tenth
Muse
,
then
,
Maggie
?
''
said
*NL*
Philip
looking
up
in
her
face
as
we
look
at
a
first
parting
in
the
*NL*
clouds
that
promises
us
a
bright
heaven
once
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all
,
''
said
Maggie
,
laughing
.
``
The
Muses
were
uncomfortable
*NL*
goddesses
,
I
think
,
--
obliged
always
to
carry
rolls
and
musical
*NL*
instruments
about
with
them
.
If
I
carried
a
harp
in
this
climate
,
you
*NL*
know
,
I
must
have
a
green
baize
cover
for
it
;
and
I
should
be
sure
to
*NL*
leave
it
behind
me
by
mistake
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
agree
with
me
in
not
liking
Corinne
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
finish
the
book
,
''
said
Maggie
.
``
As
soon
as
I
came
to
the
*NL*
blond-haired
young
lady
reading
in
the
park
,
I
shut
it
up
,
and
*NL*
determined
to
read
no
further
.
I
foresaw
that
that
light-complexioned
*NL*
girl
would
win
away
all
the
love
from
Corinne
and
make
her
miserable
.
*NL*
I
'm
determined
to
read
no
more
books
where
the
blond-haired
women
*NL*
carry
away
all
the
happiness
.
I
should
begin
to
have
a
prejudice
*NL*
against
them
.
If
you
could
give
me
some
story
,
now
,
where
the
dark
*NL*
woman
triumphs
,
it
would
restore
the
balance
.
I
want
to
avenge
Rebecca
*NL*
and
Flora
MacIvor
and
Minna
,
and
all
the
rest
of
the
dark
unhappy
*NL*
ones
.
Since
you
are
my
tutor
,
you
ought
to
preserve
my
mind
from
*NL*
prejudices
;
you
are
always
arguing
against
prejudices
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
perhaps
you
will
avenge
the
dark
women
in
your
own
person
,
and
*NL*
carry
away
all
the
love
from
your
cousin
Lucy
.
She
is
sure
to
have
*NL*
some
handsome
young
man
of
St.
Ogg
's
at
her
feet
now
;
and
you
have
*NL*
only
to
shine
upon
him
--
your
fair
little
cousin
will
be
quite
quenched
*NL*
in
your
beams
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Philip
,
that
is
not
pretty
of
you
,
to
apply
my
nonsense
to
anything
*NL*
real
,
''
said
Maggie
,
looking
hurt
.
``
As
if
I
,
with
my
old
gowns
and
want
*NL*
of
all
accomplishments
,
could
be
a
rival
of
dear
little
Lucy
,
--
who
*NL*
knows
and
does
all
sorts
of
charming
things
,
and
is
ten
times
prettier
*NL*
than
I
am
,
--
even
if
I
were
odious
and
base
enough
to
wish
to
be
her
*NL*
rival
.
Besides
,
I
never
go
to
aunt
Deane
's
when
any
one
is
there
;
it
*NL*
is
only
because
dear
Lucy
is
good
,
and
loves
me
,
that
she
comes
to
see
*NL*
me
,
and
will
have
me
go
to
see
her
sometimes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Maggie
,
''
said
Philip
,
with
surprise
,
``
it
is
not
like
you
to
take
*NL*
playfulness
literally
.
You
must
have
been
in
St.
Ogg
's
this
morning
,
*NL*
and
brought
away
a
slight
infection
of
dulness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Maggie
,
smiling
,
``
if
you
meant
that
for
a
joke
,
it
was
a
*NL*
poor
one
;
but
I
thought
it
was
a
very
good
reproof
.
I
thought
you
*NL*
wanted
to
remind
me
that
I
am
vain
,
and
wish
every
one
to
admire
me
*NL*
most
.
But
it
is
n't
for
that
that
I
'm
jealous
for
the
dark
women
,
--
not
*NL*
because
I
'm
dark
myself
;
it
's
because
I
always
care
the
most
about
the
*NL*
unhappy
people
.
If
the
blond
girl
were
forsaken
,
I
should
like
_
her
_
*NL*
best
.
I
always
take
the
side
of
the
rejected
lover
in
the
stories
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
would
never
have
the
heart
to
reject
one
yourself
,
should
*NL*
you
,
Maggie
?
''
said
Philip
,
flushing
a
little
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
said
Maggie
,
hesitatingly
.
Then
with
a
bright
smile
,
*NL*
``
I
think
perhaps
I
could
if
he
were
very
conceited
;
and
yet
,
if
he
got
*NL*
extremely
humiliated
afterward
,
I
should
relent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
often
wondered
,
Maggie
,
''
Philip
said
,
with
some
effort
,
``
whether
*NL*
you
would
n't
really
be
more
likely
to
love
a
man
that
other
women
were
*NL*
not
likely
to
love
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
would
depend
on
what
they
did
n't
like
him
for
,
''
said
Maggie
,
*NL*
laughing
.
``
He
might
be
very
disagreeable
.
He
might
look
at
me
through
*NL*
an
eye-glass
stuck
in
his
eye
,
making
a
hideous
face
,
as
young
Torry
*NL*
does
.
I
should
think
other
women
are
not
fond
of
that
;
but
I
never
*NL*
felt
any
pity
for
young
Torry
.
I
've
never
any
pity
for
conceited
*NL*
people
,
because
I
think
they
carry
their
comfort
about
with
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
suppose
,
Maggie
,
--
suppose
it
was
a
man
who
was
not
conceited
,
who
*NL*
felt
he
had
nothing
to
be
conceited
about
;
who
had
been
marked
from
*NL*
childhood
for
a
peculiar
kind
of
suffering
,
and
to
whom
you
were
the
*NL*
day-star
of
his
life
;
who
loved
you
,
worshipped
you
,
so
entirely
that
*NL*
he
felt
it
happiness
enough
for
him
if
you
would
let
him
see
you
at
*NL*
rare
moments
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Philip
paused
with
a
pang
of
dread
lest
his
confession
should
cut
*NL*
short
this
very
happiness
,
--
a
pang
of
the
same
dread
that
had
kept
his
*NL*
love
mute
through
long
months
.
A
rush
of
self-consciousness
told
him
*NL*
that
he
was
besotted
to
have
said
all
this
.
Maggie
's
manner
this
*NL*
morning
had
been
as
unconstrained
and
indifferent
as
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
was
not
looking
indifferent
now
.
Struck
with
the
unusual
*NL*
emotion
in
Philip
's
tone
,
she
had
turned
quickly
to
look
at
him
;
and
*NL*
as
he
went
on
speaking
,
a
great
change
came
over
her
face
,
--
a
flush
*NL*
and
slight
spasm
of
the
features
,
such
as
we
see
in
people
who
hear
*NL*
some
news
that
will
require
them
to
readjust
their
conceptions
of
the
*NL*
past
.
She
was
quite
silent
,
and
walking
on
toward
the
trunk
of
a
*NL*
fallen
tree
,
she
sat
down
,
as
if
she
had
no
strength
to
spare
for
her
*NL*
muscles
.
She
was
trembling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Maggie
,
''
said
Philip
,
getting
more
and
more
alarmed
in
every
fresh
*NL*
moment
of
silence
,
``
I
was
a
fool
to
say
it
;
forget
that
I
've
said
it
.
*NL*
I
shall
be
contented
if
things
can
be
as
they
were
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
distress
with
which
he
spoke
urged
Maggie
to
say
something
.
``
I
am
*NL*
so
surprised
,
Philip
;
I
had
not
thought
of
it
.
''
And
the
effort
to
say
*NL*
this
brought
the
tears
down
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
it
made
you
hate
me
,
Maggie
?
''
said
Philip
,
impetuously
.
``
Do
you
*NL*
think
I
'm
a
presumptuous
fool
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Philip
!
''
said
Maggie
,
``
how
can
you
think
I
have
such
feelings
?
As
*NL*
if
I
were
not
grateful
for
_
any
_
love
.
But
--
but
I
had
never
thought
of
*NL*
your
being
my
lover
.
It
seemed
so
far
off
--
like
a
dream
--
only
like
one
*NL*
of
the
stories
one
imagines
--
that
I
should
ever
have
a
lover
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
can
you
bear
to
think
of
me
as
your
lover
,
Maggie
?
''
said
Philip
,
*NL*
seating
himself
by
her
,
and
taking
her
hand
,
in
the
elation
of
a
*NL*
sudden
hope
.
''
_
Do
_
you
love
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
turned
rather
pale
;
this
direct
question
seemed
not
easy
to
*NL*
answer
.
But
her
eyes
met
Philip
's
,
which
were
in
this
moment
liquid
*NL*
and
beautiful
with
beseeching
love
.
She
spoke
with
hesitation
,
yet
*NL*
with
sweet
,
simple
,
girlish
tenderness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
could
hardly
love
any
one
better
;
there
is
nothing
but
what
*NL*
I
love
you
for
.
''
She
paused
a
little
while
,
and
then
added
:
``
But
it
*NL*
will
be
better
for
us
not
to
say
any
more
about
it
,
wo
n't
it
,
dear
*NL*
Philip
?
You
know
we
could
n't
even
be
friends
,
if
our
friendship
were
*NL*
discovered
.
I
have
never
felt
that
I
was
right
in
giving
way
about
*NL*
seeing
you
,
though
it
has
been
so
precious
to
me
in
some
ways
;
and
now
*NL*
the
fear
comes
upon
me
strongly
again
,
that
it
will
lead
to
evil
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
no
evil
has
come
,
Maggie
;
and
if
you
had
been
guided
by
that
fear
*NL*
before
,
you
would
only
have
lived
through
another
dreary
,
benumbing
*NL*
year
,
instead
of
reviving
into
your
real
self
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
shook
her
head
.
``
It
has
been
very
sweet
,
I
know
,
--
all
the
*NL*
talking
together
,
and
the
books
,
and
the
feeling
that
I
had
the
walk
*NL*
to
look
forward
to
,
when
I
could
tell
you
the
thoughts
that
had
come
*NL*
into
my
head
while
I
was
away
from
you
.
But
it
has
made
me
restless
;
*NL*
it
has
made
me
think
a
great
deal
about
the
world
;
and
I
have
*NL*
impatient
thoughts
again
,
--
I
get
weary
of
my
home
;
and
then
it
cuts
me
*NL*
to
the
heart
afterward
,
that
I
should
ever
have
felt
weary
of
my
*NL*
father
and
mother
.
I
think
what
you
call
being
benumbed
was
*NL*
better
--
better
for
me
--
for
then
my
selfish
desires
were
benumbed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Philip
had
risen
again
,
and
was
walking
backward
and
forward
*NL*
impatiently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Maggie
,
you
have
wrong
ideas
of
self-conquest
,
as
I
've
often
told
*NL*
you

What
you
call
self-conquest
--
binding
and
deafening
yourself
to
*NL*
all
but
one
train
of
impressions
--
is
only
the
culture
of
monomania
in
*NL*
a
nature
like
yours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
spoken
with
some
irritation
,
but
now
he
sat
down
by
her
again
*NL*
and
took
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
think
of
the
past
now

Maggie

only

can
really
cling
to
me
with
all
your
heart
,
every
obstacle
will
be
*NL*
overcome
in
time
;
we
need
only
wait

I
can
live
on
hope

Look
at
me
,
*NL*
Maggie
;
tell
me
again
it
is
possible
for
you
to
love
me

Do
n't
look

away
from
me
to
that
cloven
tree
;
it
is
a
bad
omen

*NL*
*NL*
She
turned
her
large
dark
glance
upon
him
with
a
sad
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
Maggie
,
say
one
kind
word
,
or
else
you
were
better
to
me
at

Lorton

You
asked
me
if
I
should
like
you
to
kiss
me
,

do
n't
you
*NL*
remember
?

and
you
promised
to
kiss
me
when
you
met
me
again
.
You
*NL*
never
kept
the
promise
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
recollection
of
that
childish
time
came
as
a
sweet
relief
to
*NL*
Maggie
.
It
made
the
present
moment
less
strange
to
her
.
She
kissed
him
*NL*
almost
as
simply
and
quietly
as
she
had
done
when
she
was
twelve
years
*NL*
old
.
Philip
's
eyes
flashed
with
delight
,
but
his
next
words
were
words
*NL*
of
discontent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
seem
happy
enough

Maggie
;
you
are
forcing
yourself
to
say
*NL*
you
love
me

out
of
pity
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Philip

''
said
Maggie
,
shaking
her
head
,
in
her
old
childish
way
;
*NL*
``
I
'm
telling
you
the
truth

It
is
all
new
and
strange
to
me
;
but
I
*NL*
do
n't
think
I
could
love
any
one
better
than
I
love
you

I
should
like
*NL*
always
to
live
with
you

to
make
you
happy

I
have
always
been
happy
*NL*
when
I
have
been
with

There
is
only
one
thing
I
will
not
do

your

I
will
never
do
anything

wound
my

You

ask
that
from
me

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

Maggie

will
ask
nothing

bear
everything

I
'll
wait

another
year
only
for
a
kiss

you
will
only
give
me
the
first
place
*NL*
in
your
heart

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

said
Maggie
,
smiling
,
``
I
wo
n't
make
you
wait
so
long
as
that

*NL*
But
then
,
looking
serious
again
,
she
added
,
as
she
rose
from
her
*NL*
seat
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
would
your
own

give
up
thinking
of
everything

*NL*
*NL*

No

I
ever
had
so
great
as
being

with

since
I
was
a
little

the

Tom
was
good

*NL*
*NL*
They
were
walking
hand
in
hand
,
looking
at
each
other
;
Maggie
,
indeed
,
*NL*
was
hurrying
along
,
for
she
felt
it
time
to
be
gone
.
But
the
sense
*NL*
that
their
parting
was
near
made
her
more
anxious
lest
she
should
have
*NL*
unintentionally
left
some
painful
impression
on
Philip
's
mind
.
It
was
*NL*
one
of
those
dangerous
moments
when
speech
is
at
once
sincere
and
*NL*
deceptive
;
when
feeling
,
rising
high
above
its
average
depth
,
leaves
*NL*
floodmarks
which
are
never
reached
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
stopped
to
part
among
the
Scotch
firs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
my
life
will
be
filled
with
hope
,
Maggie
,
and
I
shall
be
happier
*NL*
than
other
men
,
in
spite
of
all
?
We
_
do
_
belong
to
each
other

for
*NL*
always
--
whether
we
are
apart
or
together
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Philip
;
I
should
like
never
to
part
;
I
should
like
to
make
your
*NL*
life
very
happy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
waiting
for
something
else
.
I
wonder
whether
it
will
come

''
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
smiled
,
with
glistening
tears
,
and
then
stooped
her
tall
head
*NL*
to
kiss
the
pale
face
that
was
full
of
pleading
,
timid
love
,
--
like
a
*NL*
woman
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
a
moment
of
real
happiness
then
,
--
a
moment
of
belief
that
,
if
*NL*
there
were
sacrifice
in
this
love
,
it
was
all
the
richer
and
more
*NL*
satisfying
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
turned
away
and
hurried
home
,
feeling
that
in
the
hour
since
she
*NL*
had
trodden
this
road
before
,
a
new
era
had
begun
for
her
.
The
tissue
*NL*
of
vague
dreams
must
now
get
narrower
and
narrower
,
and
all
the
*NL*
threads
of
thought
and
emotion
be
gradually
absorbed
in
the
woof
of
*NL*
her
actual
daily
life

The

*NL*
*NL*
Secrets
are
rarely
betrayed
or
discovered
according
to
any
programme
*NL*
our
fear
has
sketched
out
.
Fear
is
almost
always
haunted
by
terrible
*NL*
dramatic
scenes
,
which
recur
in
spite
of
the
best-argued
probabilities
*NL*
against
them
;
and
during
a
year
that
Maggie
had
had
the
burthen
of
*NL*
concealment
on
her
mind
,
the
possibility
of
discovery
had
continually
*NL*
presented
itself
under
the
form
of
a
sudden
meeting
with
her
father
or
*NL*
Tom
when
she
was
walking
with
Philip
in
the
Red
Deeps
.
She
was
aware
*NL*
that
this
was
not
one
of
the
most
likely
events
;
but
it
was
the
scene
*NL*
that
most
completely
symbolized
her
inward
dread
.
Those
slight
*NL*
indirect
suggestions
which
are
dependent
on
apparently
trivial
*NL*
coincidences
and
incalculable
states
of
mind
,
are
the
favorite
*NL*
machinery
of
Fact
,
but
are
not
the
stuff
in
which
Imagination
is
apt
*NL*
to
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
Certainly
one
of
the
persons
about
whom
Maggie
's
fears
were
furthest
*NL*
from
troubling
themselves
was
her
aunt
Pullet
,
on
whom
,
seeing
that
*NL*
she
did
not
live
in
St.
Ogg
's
,
and
was
neither
sharp-eyed
nor
*NL*
sharp-tempered
,
it
would
surely
have
been
quite
whimsical
of
them
to
*NL*
fix
rather
than
on
aunt
Glegg
.
And
yet
the
channel
of
fatality
--
the
*NL*
pathway
of
the
lightning
--
was
no
other
than
aunt
Pullet
.
She
did
not
*NL*
live
at
St.
Ogg
's
,
but
the
road
from
Garum
Firs
lay
by
the
Red
Deeps
,
*NL*
at
the
end
opposite
that
by
which
Maggie
entered
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
day
after
Maggie
's
last
meeting
with
Philip
,
being
a
Sunday
on
*NL*
which
Mr.
Pullet
was
bound
to
appear
in
funeral
hatband
and
scarf
at
*NL*
St.
Ogg
's
church
,
Mrs.
Pullet
made
this
the
occasion
of
dining
with
*NL*
sister
Glegg
,
and
taking
tea
with
poor
sister
Tulliver
.
Sunday
was
the
*NL*
one
day
in
the
week
on
which
Tom
was
at
home
in
the
afternoon
;
and
*NL*
today
the
brighter
spirits
he
had
been
in
of
late
had
flowed
over
in
*NL*
unusually
cheerful
open
chat
with
his
father
,
and
in
the
invitation
,
*NL*
``
Come
,
Magsie
,
you
come
too
!
''
when
he
strolled
out
with
his
mother
in
*NL*
the
garden
to
see
the
advancing
cherry-blossoms
.
He
had
been
better
*NL*
pleased
with
Maggie
since
she
had
been
less
odd
and
ascetic
;
he
was
*NL*
even
getting
rather
proud
of
her
;
several
persons
had
remarked
in
his
*NL*
hearing
that
his
sister
was
a
very
fine
girl
.
To-day
there
was
a
*NL*
peculiar
brightness
in
her
face
,
due
in
reality
to
an
undercurrent
of
*NL*
excitement
,
which
had
as
much
doubt
and
pain
as
pleasure
in
it
;
but
it
*NL*
might
pass
for
a
sign
of
happiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
look
very
well
,
my
dear
,
''
said
aunt
Pullet
,
shaking
her
head
*NL*
sadly
,
as
they
sat
round
the
tea-table
.
``
I
niver
thought
your
girl
`
ud
*NL*
be
so
good-looking
,
Bessy
.
But
you
must
wear
pink
,
my
dear
;
that
blue
*NL*
thing
as
your
aunt
Glegg
gave
you
turns
you
into
a
crowflower
.
Jane
*NL*
never
_
was
_
tasty
.
Why
do
n't
you
wear
that
gown
o
'
mine
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
so
pretty
and
so
smart
,
aunt
.
I
think
it
's
too
showy
for
*NL*
me
,
--
at
least
for
my
other
clothes
,
that
I
must
wear
with
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
be
sure
,
it
`
ud
be
unbecoming
if
it
was
n't
well
known
you
've
got
*NL*
them
belonging
to
you
as
can
afford
to
give
you
such
things
when
*NL*
they
've
done
with
'em
themselves
.
It
stands
to
reason
I
must
give
my
*NL*
own
niece
clothes
now
and
then
,
--
such
things
as
_
I
_
buy
every
year
,
*NL*
and
never
wear
anything
out
.
And
as
for
Lucy
,
there
's
no
giving
to
*NL*
her
,
for
she
's
got
everything
o

the
choicest

sister
Deane
may
well
*NL*
hold
her
head
up

though
she
looks
dreadful

,
poor
thing

I
*NL*
doubt
this
liver
complaint
`
ull
carry
her
off
.
That
's
what
this
new
*NL*
vicar
,
this
Dr.
Kenn
,
said
in
the
funeral
sermon
to-day
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

*NL*
said
Mrs.
Tulliver
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
Lucy
had
got
a
collar
on
this
blessed
day

''
continued
Mrs.
*NL*
Pullet
,
with
her
eyes
fixed
in
a
ruminating
manner
,
``
as
I
do
n't
say
I
*NL*
have
n't
got
as
good

I
must
look

*NL*
``
Miss

say

that
's
a

*NL*
word

''
observed
Mr.
Pullet
,
on
whom
the
mysteries
of
etymology
*NL*
sometimes
fell
with
an
oppressive
weight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pooh
!
''
said
Mr.
Tulliver
,
jealous
for
Maggie
,
``
she
's
a
small
thing

*NL*
not
much
of
a
figure
.
But
fine
feathers
make
fine
birds

I
see
nothing
*NL*
to
admire
so
much
in
those
diminutive
women
;
they
look
silly
by
the
*NL*
side
o
'
the
men
,
--
out
o

proportion

When
I
chose
my
wife

I
chose
her
*NL*
the
right
size

neither
too
little
nor

*NL*
*NL*
The
poor
wife
,
with
her
withered
beauty
,
smiled
complacently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
the
men
are
n't
_
all
_
big
,
''
said
uncle
Pullet
,
not
without
some
*NL*
self-reference
;
``
a
young
fellow
may
be
good-looking
and
yet
not
be
a
*NL*
six-foot
,
like
Master
Tom
here

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
it
's
poor
talking
about
littleness
and
bigness
,
--
anybody
may
*NL*
think
it
's
a
mercy

're
straight
,
''
said
aunt
Pullet
.
``
There
's
that
*NL*
mismade
son
o
'
Lawyer
Wakem

,
I
saw
him
at
church
to-day

Dear
,
dear
!
*NL*
to
think
o

the
property
he
's
like
to
have
;
and
they
say
he
's
very
*NL*
queer
and
lonely
,
does
n't
like
much
company
.
I
should
n't
wonder
if
he
*NL*
goes
out
of
his
mind
;
for
we
never
come
along
the
road
but
he
's
*NL*
a-scrambling
out
o
'
the
trees
and
brambles
at
the
Red
Deeps
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
wide
statement
,
by
which
Mrs.
Pullet
represented
the
fact
that
*NL*
she
had
twice
seen
Philip
at
the
spot
indicated
,
produced
an
effect
on
*NL*
Maggie
which
was
all
the
stronger
because
Tom
sate
opposite
her
,
and
*NL*
she
was
intensely
anxious
to
look
indifferent
.
At
Philip
's
name
she
*NL*
had
blushed
,
and
the
blush
deepened
every
instant
from
consciousness
,
*NL*
until
the
mention
of
the
Red
Deeps
made
her
feel
as
if
the
whole
*NL*
secret
were
betrayed
,
and
she
dared
not
even
hold
her
tea-spoon
lest
*NL*
she
should
show
how
she
trembled
.
She
sat
with
her
hands
clasped
under
*NL*
the
table
,
not
daring
to
look
round
.
Happily
,
her
father
was
seated
on
*NL*
the
same
side
with
herself
,
beyond
her
uncle
Pullet
,
and
could
not
see
*NL*
her
face
without
stooping
forward
.
Her
mother
's
voice
brought
the
*NL*
first
relief
,
turning
the
conversation
;
for
Mrs.
Tulliver
was
always
*NL*
alarmed
when
the
name
of
Wakem
was
mentioned
in
her
husband
's
*NL*
presence
.
Gradually
Maggie
recovered
composure
enough
to
look
up
;
her
*NL*
eyes
met
Tom
's
,
but
he
turned
away
his
head
immediately
;
and
she
went
*NL*
to
bed
that
night
wondering
if
he
had
gathered
any
suspicion
from
her
*NL*
confusion
.
Perhaps
not
;
perhaps
he
would
think
it
was
only
her
alarm
*NL*
at
her
aunt
's
mention
of
Wakem
before
her
father
;
that
was
the
*NL*
interpretation
her
mother
had
put
in
it
.
To
her
father
,
Wakem
was
like
*NL*
a
disfiguring
disease
,
of
which
he
was
obliged
to
endure
the
*NL*
consciousness
,
but
was
exasperated
to
have
the
existence
recognized
by
*NL*
others
;
and
no
amount
of
sensitiveness
in
her
about
her
father
could
*NL*
be
surprising
,
Maggie
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Tom
was
too
keen-sighted
to
rest
satisfied
with
such
an
*NL*
interpretation
;
he
had
seen
clearly
enough
that
there
was
something
*NL*
distinct
from
anxiety
about
her
father
in
Maggie
's
excessive
*NL*
confusion
.
In
trying
to
recall
all
the
details
that
could
give
shape
*NL*
to
his
suspicions
,
he
remembered
only
lately
hearing
his
mother
scold
*NL*
Maggie
for
walking
in
the
Red
Deeps
when
the
ground
was
wet
,
and
*NL*
bringing
home
shoes
clogged
with
red
soil
;
still
Tom
,
retaining
all
*NL*
his
old
repulsion
for
Philip
's
deformity
,
shrank
from
attributing
to
*NL*
his
sister
the
probability
of
feeling
more
than
a
friendly
interest
in
*NL*
such
an
unfortunate
exception
to
the
common
run
of
men
.
Tom
's
was
a
*NL*
nature
which
had
a
sort
of
superstitious
repugnance
to
everything
*NL*
exceptional
.
A
love
for
a
deformed
man
would
be
odious
in
any
woman
,
*NL*
in
a
sister
intolerable
.
But
if
she
had
been
carrying
on
any
kind
of
*NL*
intercourse
whatever
with
Philip
,
a
stop
must
be
put
to
it
at
once
;
*NL*
she
was
disobeying
her
father
's
strongest
feelings
and
her
brother
's
*NL*
express
commands
,
besides
compromising
herself
by
secret
meetings
.
He
*NL*
left
home
the
next
morning
in
that
watchful
state
of
mind
which
turns
*NL*
the
most
ordinary
course
of
things
into
pregnant
coincidences
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
afternoon
,
about
half-past
three
o'clock
,
Tom
was
standing
on
the
*NL*
wharf
,
talking
with
Bob
Jakin
about
the
probability
of
the
good
ship
*NL*
Adelaide
coming
in
,
in
a
day
or
two
,
with
results
highly
important
to
*NL*
both
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
,
''
said
Bob
,
parenthetically
,
as
he
looked
over
the
fields
on
the
*NL*
other
side
of
the
river
,
``
there
goes
that
crooked
young
Wakem
.
I
know
*NL*
him
or
his
shadder
as
far
off
as
I
can
see
'em
;
I
'm
allays
lighting
on
*NL*
him
o
'
that
side
the
river
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
sudden
thought
seemed
to
have
darted
through
Tom
's
mind
.
``
I
must
go
,
*NL*
Bob
,
''
he
said
;
``
I
've
something
to
attend
to
,
''
hurrying
off
to
the
*NL*
warehouse
,
where
he
left
notice
for
some
one
to
take
his
place
;
he
was
*NL*
called
away
home
on
peremptory
business
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
swiftest
pace
and
the
shortest
road
took
him
to
the
gate
,
and
he
*NL*
was
pausing
to
open
it
deliberately
,
that
he
might
walk
into
the
house
*NL*
with
an
appearance
of
perfect
composure
,
when
Maggie
came
out
at
the
*NL*
front
door
in
bonnet
and
shawl
.
His
conjecture
was
fulfilled
,
and
he
*NL*
waited
for
her
at
the
gate
.
She
started
violently
when
she
saw
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tom
,
how
is
it
you
are
come
home
?
Is
there
anything
the
matter
?
''
*NL*
Maggie
spoke
in
a
low
,
tremulous
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
come
to
walk
with
you
to
the
Red
Deeps
,
and
meet
Philip
Wakem
,
''
*NL*
said
Tom
,
the
central
fold
in
his
brow
,
which
had
become
habitual
with
*NL*
him
,
deepening
as
he
spoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
stood
helpless
,
pale
and
cold
.
By
some
means
,
then
,
Tom
knew
*NL*
everything
.
At
last
she
said
,
``
I
'm
not
going
,
''
and
turned
round
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
you
are
;
but
I
want
to
speak
to
you
first

Where
is
my
father
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Out
on
horseback
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
my
mother
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
yard
,
I
think
,
with
the
poultry

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
go
in
,
then
,
without
her
seeing
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
walked
in
together
,
and
Tom
,
entering
the
parlor
,
said
to
Maggie
,
*NL*
``
Come
in
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
obeyed
,
and
he
closed
the
door
behind
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Maggie
,
tell
me
this
instant
everything
that
has
passed
between
*NL*
you
and
Philip
Wakem

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
my
father
know
anything
?
''
said
Maggie
,
still
trembling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Tom
indignantly
.
``
But
he
_
shall
_
know
,
if
you
attempt
to
*NL*
use
deceit
toward
me
any
further
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
wish
to
use
deceit
,
''
said
Maggie
,
flushing
into
resentment
at
*NL*
hearing
this
word
applied
to
her
conduct
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
the
whole
truth
,
then
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
you
know
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
Never

whether

exactly
what

know
everything

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
tell
it
for
my
father
's
sake
,
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
becomes
you
to
profess
affection
for
your
father
,
when
you
*NL*
have
despised
his
strongest
feelings
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
never
do
wrong
,
Tom
,
''
said
Maggie
,
tauntingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
if
I
know
it
,
''
answered
Tom
,
with
proud
sincerity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
have
nothing
to
say
to
you
beyond
this
:
tell
me
what
has
passed
*NL*
between
you

Philip
Wakem
.
When
did
you
first
meet
him
in
the
Red
*NL*
Deeps
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
year
ago
,
''
said
Maggie
,
quietly
.
Tom
's
severity
gave
her
a
certain
*NL*
fund
of
defiance
,
and
kept
her
sense
of
error
in
abeyance
.
``
You
need
*NL*
ask
me
no
more
questions
.
We
have
been
friendly
a
year
.
We
have
met
*NL*
and
walked
together
often
.
He
has
lent
me
books
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
all
?
''
said
Tom
,
looking
straight
at
her
with
his
frown
.
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
paused
a
moment
;
then
,
determined
to
make
an
end
of
Tom
's
right
*NL*
to
accuse
her
of
deceit
,
she
said
haughtily
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
not
quite
all
.
On
Saturday
he
told
me
that
he
loved
me
.
I
did
n't
*NL*
think
of
it
before
then
;
I
had
only
thought
of
him
as
an
old
friend
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
_
encouraged
_
him
?
''
said
Tom
,
with
an
expression
of
disgust
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
told
him
that
I
loved
him
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
was
silent
a
few
moments
,
looking
on
the
ground
and
frowning
,
with
*NL*
his
hands
in
his
pockets
.
At
last
he
looked
up
and
said
coldly
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
then
,
Maggie
,
there
are
but
two
courses
for
you
to
take
,
--
either
*NL*
you
vow
solemnly
to
me
,
with
your
hand
on
my
father
's
Bible
,
that
you
*NL*
will
never
have
another
meeting
or
speak
another
word
in
private
with
*NL*
Philip
Wakem
,
or
you
refuse
,
and
I
tell
my
father
everything
;
and
this
*NL*
month
,
when
by
my
exertions
he
might
be
made
happy
once
more
,
you
will
*NL*
cause
him
the
blow
of
knowing
that
you
are
a
disobedient
,
deceitful
*NL*
daughter
,
who
throws
away
her
own
respectability
by
clandestine
*NL*
meetings
with
the
son
of
a
man
that
has
helped
to
ruin
her
father

*NL*
Choose
!
''
Tom
ended
with
cold
decision
,
going
up
to
the
large
Bible
,
*NL*
drawing
it
forward
,
and
opening
it
at
the
fly-leaf
,
where
the
writing
*NL*
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
crushing
alternative
to
Maggie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tom
,
''
she
said
,
urged
out
of
pride
into
pleading
,
``

n't
ask
me
that

give
up

see
him
once

even
only
write
to
him

explain

everything

give
it
up
as
long
as
it
would
ever
cause
any

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

come
in

*NL*
*NL*
``
If

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do

said
Tom
.
``
I

There

I

Else

father

what
is
the
use

my
exerting
myself
and
giving
up
*NL*
everything
else
for
the
sake
of
paying
my
father

debts
,
if
you
are
*NL*
to
bring
madness
and
vexation
on
him
,
just
when
he
might
be
easy
and
*NL*
hold
up
his
head
once
more
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Tom
,
_
will
_
the
debts
be
paid
soon
?
''
said
Maggie
,
clasping
her
*NL*
hands
,
with
a
sudden
flash
of
joy
across
her
wretchedness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
things
turn
out
as
I
expect

''
said
Tom
.
``
But
,
''
he
added
,
his
voice
*NL*
trembling
with
indignation
,
``
while
I
have
been
contriving
and
working
*NL*
that
my
father
may
have
some
peace
of

working
*NL*
for
the
respectability
of
our
family
,

you
have
done
all
you
can
to
*NL*
destroy
both
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
felt
a
deep
movement
of
compunction
;
for
the
moment
,
her
mind
*NL*
ceased
to
contend
against
what
she
felt
to
be
cruel
and
unreasonable
,
*NL*
and
in
her
self-blame
she
justified
her
brother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tom
,
''
she
said
in
a
low
voice
,
``
it
was
wrong
of
me
;
but
I
was
so
*NL*
lonely
,
and
I
was
sorry
for
Philip

And
I
think
enmity
and
hatred
are
*NL*
wicked
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nonsense
!
''
said
Tom
.
``
Your
duty
was
clear
enough
.
Say
no
more
;
but
*NL*
promise
,
in
the
words
I
told
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
_
must
_
speak
to
Philip
once
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
go
with
me
now
and
speak
to
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
give
you
my
word
not
to
meet
him
or
write
to
him
again
without
your
*NL*
knowledge
.
That
is
the
only
thing
I
will
say
.
I
will
put
my
hand
on
*NL*
the
Bible
if
you
like
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
it
,
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
laid
her
hand
on
the
page
of
manuscript
and
repeated
the
*NL*
promise
.
Tom
closed
the
book
,
and
said
,
``
Now
let
us
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Not
a
word
was
spoken
as
they
walked
along
.
Maggie
was
suffering
in
*NL*
anticipation
of
what
Philip
was
about
to
suffer
,
and
dreading
the
*NL*
galling
words
that
would
fall
on
him
from
Tom
's
lips
;
but
she
felt
it
*NL*
was
in
vain
to
attempt
anything
but
submission
.
Tom
had
his
terrible
*NL*
clutch
on
her
conscience
and
her
deepest
dread
;
she
writhed
under
the
*NL*
demonstrable
truth
of
the
character
he
had
given
to
her
conduct
,
and
*NL*
yet
her
whole
soul
rebelled
against
it
as
unfair
from
its
*NL*
incompleteness
.
He
,
meanwhile
,
felt
the
impetus
of
his
indignation
*NL*
diverted
toward
Philip
.
He
did
not
know
how
much
of
an
old
boyish
*NL*
repulsion
and
of
mere
personal
pride
and
animosity
was
concerned
in
*NL*
the
bitter
severity
of
the
words
by
which
he
meant
to
do
the
duty
of
a
*NL*
son
and
a
brother
.
Tom
was
not
given
to
inquire
subtly
into
his
own
*NL*
motives
any
more
than
into
other
matters
of
an
intangible
kind
;
he
was
*NL*
quite
sure
that
his
own
motives
as
well
as
actions
were
good
,
else
he
*NL*
would
have
had
nothing
to
do
with
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
's
only
hope
was
that
something
might
,
for
the
first
time
,
have
*NL*
prevented
Philip
from
coming
.
Then
there
would
be
delay
,
--
then
she
*NL*
might
get
Tom
's
permission
to
write
to
him
.
Her
heart
beat
with
double
*NL*
violence
when
they
got
under
the
Scotch
firs
.
It
was
the
last
moment
*NL*
of
suspense
,
she
thought
;
Philip
always
met
her
soon
after
she
got
*NL*
beyond
them
.
But
they
passed
across
the
more
open
green
space
,
and
*NL*
entered
the
narrow
bushy
path
by
the
mound
.
Another
turning
,
and
they
*NL*
came
so
close
upon
him
that
both
Tom
and
Philip
stopped
suddenly
*NL*
within
a
yard
of
each
other
.
There
was
a
moment
's
silence
,
in
which
*NL*
Philip
darted
a
look
of
inquiry
at
Maggie
's
face
.
He
saw
an
answer
*NL*
there
,
in
the
pale
,
parted
lips
,
and
the
terrified
tension
of
the
*NL*
large
eyes
.
Her
imagination
,
always
rushing
extravagantly
beyond
an
*NL*
immediate
impression
,
saw
her
tall
,
strong
brother
grasping
the
feeble
*NL*
Philip
bodily
,
crushing
him
and
trampling
on
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
call
this
acting
the
part
of
a
man
and
a
gentleman
,
sir
?
''
Tom
*NL*
said
,
in
a
voice
of
harsh
scorn
,
as
soon
as
Philip
's
eyes
were
turned
*NL*
on
him
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
?
''
answered
Philip
,
haughtily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mean
?
Stand
farther
from
me
,
lest
I
should
lay
hands
on
you
,
and
I
'll
*NL*
tell
you
what
I
mean
.
I
mean
,
taking
advantage
of
a
young
girl
's
*NL*
foolishness
and
ignorance
to
get
her
to
have
secret
meetings
with
you
.
*NL*
I
mean
,
daring
to
trifle
with
the
respectability
of
a
family
that
has
*NL*
a
good
and
honest
name
to
support
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
deny
that
,
''
interrupted
Philip
,
impetuously
.
``
I
could
never
trifle
*NL*
with
anything
that
affected
your
sister
's
happiness

She
is
dearer

me
than
she
is
to
you
;
I
honor
her
more
than
you
can
ever
honor
her
;
I
*NL*
would
give
up
my
life
to
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
talk
high-flown
nonsense
to
me
,
sir
!
Do
you
mean
to
pretend
*NL*
that
you
did
n't
know
it
would
be
injurious
to
her
to
meet
you
here
*NL*
week
after
week
?
Do
you
pretend
you
had
any
right
to
make
professions
*NL*
of
love
to
her
,
even
if
you
had
been
a
fit
husband
for
her
,
when
*NL*
neither
her

your
father

ever
consent
to
a
marriage
*NL*
between
you

And
_
you

you

yourself
into
the

affections

a
handsome
girl
who
is
not
eighteen
,
and
has
been
shut
*NL*
out
from
the
world
by
her
father
's
misfortunes

That

your
crooked

notion
of
honor

is
it

I
call

base
treachery

call
it

advantage

circumstances
to
win
what
's
too
good

you

what
you

*NL*
never
get
by
fair
means

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
manly
of
you
to
talk
in
this
way
to
_
me
_
,
''
said
Philip
,
*NL*
bitterly
,
his
whole
frame
shaken
by
violent
emotions
.
``
Giants
have
an
*NL*
immemorial
right

insolent
abuse

incapable

even

much

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
be
very
sorry

said
Tom
,
with
*NL*
scorching
contempt
.
``
What
I

''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
and
Maggie
walked
on
in
silence
for
some
yards
.
He
burst
out
,
in
a
*NL*
convulsed
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stay

said
Philip
,
making
a
strong
effort
to
speak

Then
*NL*
looking
at
Tom
,
``

I
suppose

that
*NL*
she
may
stand
by
while
you
threaten
and
insult
me

These
naturally
*NL*
seemed
to
you
the
right
means
to
influence
me
.
But
you
are
mistaken
.
*NL*
Let
your
sister
speak
.
If
she
says
she
is
bound
to
give
me
up
,
I
shall
*NL*
abide
by
her
wishes
to
the
slightest
word

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
for
my
father

said
Maggie
,
imploringly
.
``
Tom
*NL*
threatens
to
tell
my

he
could
n't
bear
it

I

vowed
solemnly

*NL*
``
It

anything

good

you

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

''
said
Tom
,
exasperated
by
this
attitude
of
Philip

,
``
you
can
*NL*
talk
of
seeking
good
for

her
good

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did

at
some
risk

have
a

who
would
cherish
her
,
who
would
do
her
more
justice
than
a
*NL*
coarse
and
narrow-minded

lavished
her

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

my
way
of
befriending
her
is
different

I
'll
tell

you
what
is
my
way

I
'll
save
her
from
disobeying

disgracing
her

I
'll
save
her
from
throwing
herself
away

herself
a
laughing-stock

from
being
flouted
by
a
man

enough
what

of
justice
and
cherishing
you
were
preparing
for
her

*NL*
I
'm
not
to
be
imposed
upon
by
fine
words
;
I
can
see
what
actions
mean

Come
away

Maggie

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
seized
Maggie
's
right
wrist
as
he
spoke
,
and
she
put
out
her
left
*NL*
hand
.
Philip
clasped
it
an
instant
,
with
one
eager
look
,
and
then
*NL*
hurried
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
and
Maggie
walked
on
in
silence
for
some
yards
.
He
was
still
*NL*
holding
her
wrist
tightly
,
as
if
he
were
compelling
a
culprit
from
the
*NL*
scene
of
action
.
At
last
Maggie
,
with
a
violent
snatch
,
drew
her
hand
*NL*
away
,
and
her
pent-up
,
long-gathered
irritation
burst
into
utterance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
suppose
that
I
think
you
are
right

Tom
,
or
that
I
bow
to
your

will

I
despise
the
feelings
you
have
shown
in
speaking
to
Philip
;
I
*NL*
detest
your
insulting

unmanly
allusions
to
his
deformity

You
have
*NL*
been
reproaching
other
people
all
your
life

you
have
been
always
sure
*NL*
you
yourself
are
right

It
is
because
you
have
not
a
mind
large
enough

to
see
that
there
is
anything
better

your

your

*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly

said
Tom

coolly

``
I

If
your

Philip
Wakem

*NL*
conduct

has
been
right

why
are
you
ashamed
of
its
being
known

*NL*
Answer
me
that

I
know
what
I
have
aimed
at
in
my
conduct

I

succeeded

what
good

brought
to
you

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
want
to
defend
myself

''
said
Maggie
,
still
with
vehemence
:
``
I
*NL*
know
I
've
been
wrong
,
--
often
,
continually
.
But
yet
,
sometimes
when
I
*NL*
have
done
wrong
,
it
has
been
because
I
have
feelings
that
you
would
be
*NL*
the
better
for
,
if
you
had
them
.
If
_
you
_
were
in
fault
ever
,
if
you
*NL*
had
done
anything
very
wrong
,
I
should
be
sorry
for
the
pain
it
*NL*
brought
you
;
I
should
not
want
punishment
to
be
heaped
on
you
.
But
you
*NL*
have
always
enjoyed
punishing
me
;
you
have
always
been
hard
and
cruel
*NL*
to
me
;
even
when
I
was
a
little
girl
,
and
always
loved
you
better
than
*NL*
any
one
else
in
the
world
,
you
would
let
me
go
crying
to
bed
without
*NL*
forgiving
me
.
You
have
no
pity
;
you
have
no
sense
of
your
own
*NL*
imperfection
and
your
own
sins
.
It
is
a
sin
to
be
hard
;
it
is
not
*NL*
fitting
for
a
mortal
,
for
a
Christian
.
You
are
nothing
but
a
Pharisee
.
*NL*
You
thank
God
for
nothing
but
your
own
virtues
;
you
think
they
are
*NL*
great
enough
to
win
you
everything
else
.
You
have
not
even
a
vision
of
*NL*
feelings
by
the
side
of
which
your
shining
virtues
are
mere
darkness
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Tom
,
with
cold
scorn
,
``
if
your
feelings
are
so
much
*NL*
better
than
mine
,
let
me
see
you
show
them
in
some
other
way
than
by
*NL*
conduct
that
's
likely
to
disgrace
us
all
,
--
than
by
ridiculous
flights
*NL*
first
into
one
extreme
and
then
into
another
.
Pray
,
how
have
you
shown
*NL*
your
love
,
that
you
talk
of
,
either
to
me
or
my
father
?
By
disobeying
*NL*
and
deceiving
us
.
I
have
a
different
way
of
showing
my
affection
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
you
are
a
man
,
Tom
,
and
have
power
,
and
can
do
something
in
*NL*
the
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
if
you
can
do
nothing

*NL*
*NL*
``
So
I
_

I
will

submit
even
to
what
is
unreasonable
from
my
father
,
but
I
will
not
*NL*
submit
to
it
from
you
.
You
boast
of
your
virtues
as
if
they
purchased
*NL*
you
a
right
to
be
cruel
and
unmanly
,
as
you
've
been
to-day

Do
n't
*NL*
suppose
I
would
give
up
Philip
Wakem
in
obedience
to
you

deformity
you
insult

cling

the
*NL*
more

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
;
that
is
your
view
of
things

said
Tom
,
more
coldly
than
*NL*
ever
;
``
you
need
say
no
more
to
show
me
what
a
wide
distance
there
is
*NL*
between
us
.
Let
us
remember
that
in
future
,
and
be
silent

''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
went
back
to
St.
Ogg
's
,
to
fulfill
an
appointment
with
his
uncle
*NL*
Deane
,
and
receive
directions
about
a
journey
on
which
he
was
to
set
*NL*
out
the
next
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
went
up
to
her
own
room
to
pour
out
all
that
indignant
*NL*
remonstrance
,
against
which
Tom
's
mind
was
close
barred
,
in
bitter
*NL*
tears
.
Then
,
when
the
first
burst
of
unsatisfied
anger
was
gone
by
,
*NL*
came
the
recollection
of
that
quiet
time
before
the
pleasure
which
had
*NL*
ended
in
to-day
's
misery
had
perturbed
the
clearness
and
simplicity
of
*NL*
her
life
.
She
used
to
think
in
that
time
that
she
had
made
great
*NL*
conquests
,
and
won
a
lasting
stand
on
serene
heights
above
worldly
*NL*
temptations
and
conflict
.
And
here
she
was
down
again
in
the
thick
of
*NL*
a
hot
strife
with
her
own
and
others
'
passions
.
Life
was
not
so
short
,
*NL*
then
,
and
perfect
rest
was
not
so
near
as
she
had
dreamed
when
she
was
*NL*
two
years
younger
.
There
was
more
struggle
for
her
,
and
perhaps
more
*NL*
falling
.
If
she
had
felt
that
she
was
entirely
wrong
,
and
that
Tom
had
*NL*
been
entirely
right
,
she
could
sooner
have
recovered
more
inward
*NL*
harmony
;
but
now
her
penitence
and
submission
were
constantly
*NL*
obstructed
by
resentment
that
would
present
itself
to
her
no
otherwise
*NL*
than
as
a
just
indignation
.
Her
heart
bled
for
Philip
;
she
went
on
*NL*
recalling
the
insults
that
had
been
flung
at
him
with
so
vivid
a
*NL*
conception
of
what
he
had
felt
under
them
,
that
it
was
almost
like
a
*NL*
sharp
bodily
pain
to
her
,
making
her
beat
the
floor
with
her
foot
and
*NL*
tighten
her
fingers
on
her
palm
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
yet
,
how
was
it
that
she
was
now
and
then
conscious
of
a
certain
*NL*
dim
background
of
relief
in
the
forced
separation
from
Philip
?
Surely
*NL*
it
was
only
because
the
sense
of
a
deliverance
from
concealment
was
*NL*
welcome
at
any
cost
.

Chapter

*NL*
*NL*
The
Hard-Won
Triumph
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Three
weeks
later
,
when
Dorlcote
Mill
was
at
its
prettiest
moment
in
*NL*
all
the
year
,
--
the
great
chestnuts
in
blossom
,
and
the
grass
all
deep
*NL*
and
daisied
,
--
Tom
Tulliver
came
home
to
it
earlier
than
usual
in
the
*NL*
evening
,
and
as
he
passed
over
the
bridge
,
he
looked
with
the
old
*NL*
deep-rooted
affection
at
the
respectable
red
brick
house
,
which
always
*NL*
seemed
cheerful
and
inviting
outside
,
let
the
rooms
be
as
bare
and
the
*NL*
hearts
as
sad
as
they
might
inside
.
There
is
a
very
pleasant
light
in
*NL*
Tom
's
blue-gray
eyes
as
he
glances
at
the
house-windows
;
that
fold
in
*NL*
his
brow
never
disappears
,
but
it
is
not
unbecoming
;
it
seems
to
imply
*NL*
a
strength
of
will
that
may
possibly
be
without
harshness
,
when
the
*NL*
eyes
and
mouth
have
their
gentlest
expression
.
His
firm
step
becomes
*NL*
quicker
,
and
the
corners
of
his
mouth
rebel
against
the
compression
*NL*
which
is
meant
to
forbid
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
eyes
in
the
parlor
were
not
turned
toward
the
bridge
just
then
,
*NL*
and
the
group
there
was
sitting
in
unexpectant
silence
,
--
Mr.
Tulliver
*NL*
in
his
arm-chair
,
tired
with
a
long
ride
,
and
ruminating
with
a
worn
*NL*
look
,
fixed
chiefly
on
Maggie
,
who
was
bending
over
her
sewing
while
*NL*
her
mother
was
making
the
tea
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
all
looked
up
with
surprise
when
they
heard
the
well-known
foot
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
what
's
up
now
,
Tom
?
''
said
his
father
.
``
You
're
a
bit
earlier
than
*NL*
usual
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
there
was
nothing
more
for
me
to
do
,
so
I
came
away
.
Well
,
*NL*
mother
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
went
up
to
his
mother
and
kissed
her
,
a
sign
of
unusual
good-humor
*NL*
with
him
.
Hardly
a
word
or
look
had
passed
between
him
and
Maggie
in
*NL*
all
the
three
weeks
;
but
his
usual
incommunicativeness
at
home
*NL*
prevented
this
from
being
noticeable
to
their
parents
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Father
,
''
said
Tom
,
when
they
had
finished
tea
,
``
do
you
know
exactly
*NL*
how
much
money
there
is
in
the
tin
box
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
a
hundred
and
ninety-three
pound
,
''
said
Mr.
Tulliver
.
``
You
've
*NL*
brought
less
o
'
late
;
but
young
fellows
like
to
have
their
own
way
*NL*
with
their
money
.
Though
I
did
n't
do
as
I
liked
before
_
I
_
was
of
*NL*
age
.
''
He
spoke
with
rather
timid
discontent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
quite
sure
that
's
the
sum
,
father
?
''
said
Tom
.
``
I
wish
you
*NL*
would
take
the
trouble
to
fetch
the
tin
box
down
.
I
think
you
have
*NL*
perhaps
made
a
mistake
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
should
I
make
a
mistake
?
''
said
his
father
,
sharply
.
``
I
've
counted
*NL*
it
often
enough
;
but
I
can
fetch
it
,
if
you
wo
n't
believe
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
always
an
incident
Mr.
Tulliver
liked
,
in
his
gloomy
life
,
to
*NL*
fetch
the
tin
box
and
count
the
money
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
go
out
of
the
room
,
mother
,
''
said
Tom
,
as
he
saw
her
moving
*NL*
when
his
father
was
gone
upstairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
is
n't
Maggie
to
go
?
''
said
Mrs.
Tulliver
;
``
because
somebody
must
*NL*
take
away
the
things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
as
she
likes
,
''
said
Tom
indifferently
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
a
cutting
word
to
Maggie
.
Her
heart
had
leaped
with
the
*NL*
sudden
conviction
that
Tom
was
going
to
tell
their
father
the
debts
*NL*
could
be
paid
;
and
Tom
would
have
let
her
be
absent
when
that
news
was
*NL*
told
!
But
she
carried
away
the
tray
and
came
back
immediately
.
The
*NL*
feeling
of
injury
on
her
own
behalf
could
not
predominate
at
that
*NL*
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
drew
to
the
corner
of
the
table
near
his
father
when
the
tin
box
*NL*
was
set
down
and
opened
,
and
the
red
evening
light
falling
on
them
*NL*
made
conspicuous
the
worn
,
sour
gloom
of
the
dark-eyed
father
and
the
*NL*
suppressed
joy
in
the
face
of
the
fair-complexioned
son
.
The
mother
*NL*
and
Maggie
sat
at
the
other
end
of
the
table
,
the
one
in
blank
*NL*
patience
,
the
other
in
palpitating
expectation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Tulliver
counted
out
the
money
,
setting
it
in
order
on
the
table
,
*NL*
and
then
said
,
glancing
sharply
at
Tom
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
now
!
you
see
I
was
right
enough
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
paused
,
looking
at
the
money
with
bitter
despondency
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
more
nor
three
hundred
wanting

it
'll
be
a
fine
while

can
save
that

job
.
This
world
's
been
too
many
for
me
.
It
's
took
four
year
to
lay
*NL*
_
this
_
by
;
it
's
much
if
I
'm
above
ground
for
another
four
year
.
I
must
*NL*
trusten
to
you
to
pay
'em
,
''
he
went
on
,
with
a
trembling
voice
,
``
if
*NL*
you
keep
i
'
the
same
mind
now
you
're
coming
o
'
age
.
But
you
're
like
*NL*
enough
to
bury
me
first
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
up
in
Tom
's
face
with
a
querulous
desire
for
some
assurance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
father
,
''
said
Tom
,
speaking
with
energetic
decision
,
though
there
*NL*
was
tremor
discernible
in
his
voice
too
,
``
you
will
live
to
see
the
*NL*
debts
all
paid
.
You
shall
pay
them
with
your
own
hand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
tone
implied
something
more
than
mere
hopefulness
or
resolution
.
A
*NL*
slight
electric
shock
seemed
to
pass
through
Mr.
Tulliver
,
and
he
kept
*NL*
his
eyes
fixed
on
Tom
with
a
look
of
eager
inquiry
,
while
Maggie
,
*NL*
unable
to
restrain
herself
,
rushed
to
her
father
's
side
and
knelt
down
*NL*
by
him
.
Tom
was
silent
a
little
while
before
he
went
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
good
while
ago
,
my
uncle
Glegg
lent
me
a
little
money
to
trade
*NL*
with
,
and
that
has
answered
.
I
have
three
hundred
and
twenty
pounds
in
*NL*
the
bank
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
mother
's
arms
were
round
his
neck
as
soon
as
the
last
words
were
*NL*
uttered
,
and
she
said
,
half
crying
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
boy
,
I
knew
you
'd
make
iverything
right
again
,
when
you
got
a
*NL*
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
his
father
was
silent
;
the
flood
of
emotion
hemmed
in
all
power
of
*NL*
speech
.
Both
Tom
and
Maggie
were
struck
with
fear
lest
the
shock
of
*NL*
joy
might
even
be
fatal
.
But
the
blessed
relief
of
tears
came
.
The
*NL*
broad
chest
heaved
,
the
muscles
of
the
face
gave
way
,
and
the
*NL*
gray-haired
man
burst
into
loud
sobs
.
The
fit
of
weeping
gradually
*NL*
subsided
,
and
he
sat
quiet
,
recovering
the
regularity
of
his
*NL*
breathing
.
At
last
he
looked
up
at
his
wife
and
said
,
in
a
gentle
*NL*
tone
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bessy
,
you
must
come
and
kiss
me
now
--
the
lad
has
made
you
amends
.
*NL*
You
'll
see
a
bit
o
'
comfort
again
,
belike
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
had
kissed
him
,
and
he
had
held
her
hand
a
minute
,
his
*NL*
thoughts
went
back
to
the
money
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
you
'd
brought
me
the
money
to
look
at
,
Tom
,
''
he
said
,
*NL*
fingering
the
sovereigns
on
the
table
;
``
I
should
ha
'
felt
surer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
shall
see
it
to-morrow
,
father
,
''
said
Tom
.
``
My
uncle
Deane
has
*NL*
appointed
the
creditors
to
meet
to-morrow
at
the
Golden
Lion
,
and
he
*NL*
has
ordered
a
dinner
for
them
at
two
o'clock
.
My
uncle
Glegg
and
he
*NL*
will
both
be
there
.
It
was
advertised
in
the
`
Messenger

on
Saturday
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
Wakem
knows
o
n't
!
''
said
Mr.
Tulliver
,
his
eye
kindling
with
*NL*
triumphant
fire
.
``
Ah
!
''
he
went
on
,
with
a
long-drawn
guttural
*NL*
enunciation
,
taking
out
his
snuff-box
,
the
only
luxury
he
had
left
*NL*
himself
,
and
tapping
it
with
something
of
his
old
air
of
defiance
.
*NL*
``
I
'll
get
from
under
_
his
_
thumb
now
,
though
I
_
must
_
leave
the

thought

out

got
a

nothing

the
house

Bessy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
drawing
out
her
much-reduced
bunch
of
keys
,
*NL*
``
there
's
some
brandy
sister
Deane
brought
me
when
I
was
ill
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Get
it
me

then

get
it
me
.
I
feel
a
bit
weak
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tom
,
my
lad
,
''
he
said
,
in
a
stronger
voice
,
when
he
had
taken
some
*NL*
brandy-and-water
,
``
you
shall
make
a
speech
to
'em
.
I
'll
tell
'em

*NL*
you

best
part

the
money

They
'll
see
I

honest
at

,
*NL*
and
ha

got
an
honest
son

Ah

fine
and
glad
to
have
a

mine

a
fine

you
'll
maybe
see
the
day
*NL*
when
Wakem
and
his

be
a
round

two
below

enough

before

nothing

And
if

rich
enough

mind
*NL*
this
--
try
and
get
th

old
mill
again

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Tulliver
threw
himself
back
in
his
chair
;
his
mind
,
which
had
so
*NL*
long
been
the
home
of
nothing
but
bitter
discontent
and
foreboding
,
*NL*
suddenly
filled
,
by
the
magic
of
joy
,
with
visions
of
good
fortune
.
*NL*
But
some
subtle
influence
prevented
him
from
foreseeing
the
good
*NL*
fortune
as
happening
to
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shake
hands
wi
'
me
,
my
lad
,
''
he
said
,
suddenly
putting
out
his
hand
.
*NL*
``
It
's
a
great
thing
when
a
man
can
be
proud
as
he
's
got
a
good
son
.
*NL*
I
've
had
_
that
_
luck
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
never
lived
to
taste
another
moment
so
delicious
as
that
;
and
*NL*
Maggie
could
n't
help
forgetting
her
own
grievances
.
Tom
_
was
_
good
;
*NL*
and
in
the
sweet
humility
that
springs
in
us
all
in
moments
of
true
*NL*
admiration
and
gratitude
,
she
felt
that
the
faults
he
had
to
pardon
in
*NL*
her
had
never
been
redeemed
,
as
his
faults
were
.
She
felt
no
jealousy
*NL*
this
evening
that
,
for
the
first
time
,
she
seemed
to
be
thrown
into
*NL*
the
background
in
her
father
's
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
much
more
talk
before
bedtime
.
Mr.
Tulliver
naturally
wanted
*NL*
to
hear
all
the
particulars
of
Tom
's
trading
adventures
,
and
he
*NL*
listened
with
growing
excitement
and
delight
.
He
was
curious
to
know
*NL*
what
had
been
said
on
every
occasion
;
if
possible
,
what
had
been
*NL*
thought
;
and
Bob
Jakin
's
part
in
the
business
threw
him
into
peculiar
*NL*
outbursts
of
sympathy
with
the
triumphant
knowingness
of
that
*NL*
remarkable
packman
.
Bob
's
juvenile
history
,
so
far
as
it
had
come
*NL*
under
Mr.
Tulliver
's
knowledge
,
was
recalled
with
that
sense
of
*NL*
astonishing
promise
it
displayed
,
which
is
observable
in
all
*NL*
reminiscences
of
the
childhood
of
great
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
well
that
there
was
this
interest
of
narrative
to
keep
under
*NL*
the
vague
but
fierce
sense
of
triumph
over
Wakem
,
which
would
*NL*
otherwise
have
been
the
channel
his
joy
would
have
rushed
into
with
*NL*
dangerous
force
.
Even
as
it
was
,
that
feeling
from
time
to
time
gave
*NL*
threats
of
its
ultimate
mastery
,
in
sudden
bursts
of
irrelevant
*NL*
exclamation
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
long
before
Mr.
Tulliver
got
to
sleep
that
night
;
and
the
*NL*
sleep
,
when
it
came
,
was
filled
with
vivid
dreams
.
At
half-past
five
*NL*
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
when
Mrs.
Tulliver
was
already
rising
,
he
*NL*
alarmed
her
by
starting
up
with
a
sort
of
smothered
shout
,
and
looking
*NL*
round
in
a
bewildered
way
at
the
walls
of
the
bedroom
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
matter
,
Mr.
Tulliver
?
''
said
his
wife
.
He
looked
at
her
,
*NL*
still
with
a
puzzled
expression
,
and
said
at
last
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
--
I
was
dreaming
--
did
I
make
a
noise
?
--
I
thought
I
'd
got
hold
of
*NL*
him
.

Chapter
VII
*NL*
*NL*
A
Day
of
Reckoning
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Tulliver
was
an
essentially
sober
man
,
--
able
to
take
his
glass
and
*NL*
not
averse
to
it
,
but
never
exceeding
the
bounds
of
moderation
.
He
had
*NL*
naturally
an
active
Hotspur
temperament
,
which
did
not
crave
liquid
*NL*
fire
to
set
it
aglow
;
his
impetuosity
was
usually
equal
to
an
exciting
*NL*
occasion
without
any
such
reinforcements
;
and
his
desire
for
the
*NL*
brandy-and-water
implied
that
the
too
sudden
joy
had
fallen
with
a
*NL*
dangerous
shock
on
a
frame
depressed
by
four
years
of
gloom
and
*NL*
unaccustomed
hard
fare
.
But
that
first
doubtful
tottering
moment
*NL*
passed
,
he
seemed
to
gather
strength
with
his
gathering
excitement
;
*NL*
and
the
next
day
,
when
he
was
seated
at
table
with
his
creditors
,
his
*NL*
eye
kindling
and
his
cheek
flushed
with
the
consciousness
that
he
was
*NL*
about
to
make
an
honorable
figure
once
more
,
he
looked
more
like
the
*NL*
proud
,
confident
,
warm-hearted
,
and
warm-tempered
Tulliver
of
old
*NL*
times
than
might
have
seemed
possible
to
any
one
who
had
met
him
a
*NL*
week
before
,
riding
along
as
had
been
his
wont
for
the
last
four
years
*NL*
since
the
sense
of
failure
and
debt
had
been
upon
him
,
--
with
his
head
*NL*
hanging
down
,
casting
brief
,
unwilling
looks
on
those
who
forced
*NL*
themselves
on
his
notice
.
He
made
his
speech
,
asserting
his
honest
*NL*
principles
with
his
old
confident
eagerness
,
alluding
to
the
rascals
*NL*
and
the
luck
that
had
been
against
him
,
but
that
he
had
triumphed
*NL*
over
,
to
some
extent
,
by
hard
efforts
and
the
aid
of
a
good
son
;
and
*NL*
winding
up
with
the
story
of
how
Tom
had
got
the
best
part
of
the
*NL*
needful
money
.
But
the
streak
of
irritation
and
hostile
triumph
seemed
*NL*
to
melt
for
a
little
while
into
purer
fatherly
pride
and
pleasure
,
*NL*
when
,
Tom
's
health
having
been
proposed
,
and
uncle
Deane
having
taken
*NL*
occasion
to
say
a
few
words
of
eulogy
on
his
general
character
and
*NL*
conduct
,
Tom
himself
got
up
and
made
the
single
speech
of
his
life
.
It
*NL*
could
hardly
have
been
briefer
.
He
thanked
the
gentlemen
for
the
honor
*NL*
they
had
done
him
.
He
was
glad
that
he
had
been
able
to
help
his
*NL*
father
in
proving
his
integrity
and
regaining
his
honest
name
;
and
,
*NL*
for
his
own
part
,
he
hoped
he
should
never
undo
that
work
and
disgrace
*NL*
that
name
.
But
the
applause
that
followed
was
so
great
,
and
Tom
looked
*NL*
so
gentlemanly
as
well
as
tall
and
straight
,
that
Mr.
Tulliver
*NL*
remarked
,
in
an
explanatory
manner
,
to
his
friends
on
his
right
and
*NL*
left
,
that
he
had
spent
a
deal
of
money
on
his
son
's
education
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
party
broke
up
in
very
sober
fashion
at
five
o'clock
.
Tom
remained
*NL*
in
St.
Ogg
's
to
attend
to
some
business
,
and
Mr.
Tulliver
mounted
his
*NL*
horse
to
go
home
,
and
describe
the
memorable
things
that
had
been
said
*NL*
and
done
,
to
``
poor
Bessy
and
the
little
wench
.
''
The
air
of
excitement
*NL*
that
hung
about
him
was
but
faintly
due
to
good
cheer
or
any
stimulus
*NL*
but
the
potent
wine
of
triumphant
joy
.
He
did
not
choose
any
back
*NL*
street
to-day
,
but
rode
slowly
,
with
uplifted
head
and
free
glances
,
*NL*
along
the
principal
street
all
the
way
to
the
bridge
.
*NL*
*NL*
Why
did
he
not
happen
to
meet
Wakem
?
The
want
of
that
coincidence
*NL*
vexed
him
,
and
set
his
mind
at
work
in
an
irritating
way
.
Perhaps
*NL*
Wakem
was
gone
out
of
town
to-day
on
purpose
to
avoid
seeing
or
*NL*
hearing
anything
of
an
honorable
action
which
might
well
cause
him
*NL*
some
unpleasant
twinges
.
If
Wakem
were
to
meet
him
then
,
Mr.
Tulliver
*NL*
would
look
straight
at
him
,
and
the
rascal
would
perhaps
be
forsaken
a
*NL*
little
by
his
cool
,
domineering
impudence
.
He
would
know
by
and
by
*NL*
that
an
honest
man
was
not
going
to
serve
_
him
_
any
longer
,
and
lend
*NL*
his
honesty
to
fill
a
pocket
already
over-full
of
dishonest
gains
.
*NL*
Perhaps
the
luck
was
beginning
to
turn
;
perhaps
the
Devil
did
n't
*NL*
always
hold
the
best
cards
in
this
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
Simmering
in
this
way
,
Mr.
Tulliver
approached
the
yardgates
of
*NL*
Dorlcote
Mill
,
near
enough
to
see
a
well-known
figure
coming
out
of
*NL*
them
on
a
fine
black
horse
.
They
met
about
fifty
yards
from
the
gates
,
*NL*
between
the
great
chestnuts
and
elms
and
the
high
bank
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tulliver
,
''
said
Wakem
,
abruptly
,
in
a
haughtier
tone
than
usual
,
*NL*
``
what
a
fool
's
trick
you
did
,
--
spreading
those
hard
lumps
on
that
Far
*NL*
Close
!
I
told
you
how
it
would
be
;
but
you
men
never
learn
to
farm
*NL*
with
any
method
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
said
Tulliver
,
suddenly
boiling
up
;
``
get
somebody
else
to
farm
*NL*
for
you
,
then
,
as
'll
ask
_
you
_
to
teach
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
been
drinking
,
I
suppose
,
''
said
Wakem
,
really
believing
that
*NL*
this
was
the
meaning
of
Tulliver
's
flushed
face
and
sparkling
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
've
not
been
drinking
,
''

-LRB-
Tulliver
was
backing
his
horse
*NL*
across
the

hem
Wakem
in

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

I

sha
'n'

let

''
said
Tulliver
,
getting
fiercer
.
``
I
*NL*
shall
tell
you
what
I
think
of
you
first
.
You
're
too
big
a
raskill
to
*NL*
get
hanged
--
you
're
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
pass

you
ignorant
brute
,
or
I
'll
ride
over
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Tulliver
,
spurring
his
horse
and
raising
his
whip
,
made
a
rush
*NL*
forward
;
and
Wakem
's
horse
,
rearing
and
staggering
backward
,
threw
his
*NL*
rider
from
the
saddle
and
sent
him
sideways
on
the
ground
.
Wakem
had
*NL*
had
the
presence
of
mind
to
loose
the
bridle
at
once
,
and
as
the
horse
*NL*
only
staggered
a
few
paces
and
then
stood
still
,
he
might
have
risen
*NL*
and
remounted
without
more
inconvenience
than
a
bruise
and
a
shake
.
*NL*
But
before
he
could
rise
,
Tulliver
was
off
his
horse
too
.
The
sight
of
*NL*
the
long-hated
predominant
man
down
,
and
in
his
power
,
threw
him
into
*NL*
a
frenzy
of
triumphant
vengeance
,
which
seemed
to
give
him
*NL*
preternatural
agility
and
strength
.
He
rushed
on
Wakem
,
who
was
in
the
*NL*
act
of
trying
to
recover
his
feet
,
grasped
him
by
the
left
arm
so
as
*NL*
to
press
Wakem
's
whole
weight
on
the
right
arm
,
which
rested
on
the
*NL*
ground
,
and
flogged
him
fiercely
across
the
back
with
his
riding-whip
.
*NL*
Wakem
shouted
for
help
,
but
no
help
came
,
until
a
woman
's
scream
was
*NL*
heard
,
and
the
cry
of
``
Father
,
father
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
,
Wakem
felt
,
something
had
arrested
Mr.
Tulliver
's
arm
;
for
*NL*
the
flogging
ceased
,
and
the
grasp
on
his
own
arm
was
relaxed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Get
away
with
you
--
go
!
''
said
Tulliver
,
angrily
.
But
it
was
not
to
*NL*
Wakem
that
he
spoke
.
Slowly
the
lawyer
rose
,
and
,
as
he
turned
his
*NL*
head
,
saw
that
Tulliver
's
arms
were
being
held
by
a
girl
,
rather
by
*NL*
the
fear
of
hurting
the
girl
that
clung
to
him
with
all
her
young
*NL*
might
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Luke
--
mother
--
come
and
help
Mr.
Wakem
!
''
Maggie
cried
,
as
she
*NL*
heard
the
longed-for
footsteps
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Help
me
on
to
that
low
horse
,
''
said
Wakem
to
Luke
,
``
then
I
shall
*NL*
perhaps
manage
;
though
--
confound
it
--
I
think
this
arm
is
sprained
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
some
difficulty
,
Wakem
was
heaved
on
to
Tulliver
's
horse
.
Then
he
*NL*
turned
toward
the
miller
and
said
,
with
white
rage
,
``
You
'll
suffer
for
*NL*
this
,
sir
.
Your
daughter
is
a
witness
that
you
've
assaulted
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
care
,
''
said
Mr.
Tulliver
,
in
a
thick
,
fierce
voice
;
``
go
and
*NL*
show
your
back
,
and
tell
'em
I
thrashed
you
.
Tell
'em
I
've
made
things
*NL*
a
bit
more
even
i
'
the
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ride
my
horse
home
with
me
,
''
said
Wakem
to
Luke
.
``
By
the
Tofton
*NL*
Ferry
,
not
through
the
town
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Father
,
come
in
!
''
said
Maggie
,
imploringly
.
Then
,
seeing
that
Wakem
*NL*
had
ridden
off
,
and
that
no
further
violence
was
possible
,
she
*NL*
slackened
her
hold
and
burst
into
hysteric
sobs
,
while
poor
Mrs.
*NL*
Tulliver
stood
by
in
silence
,
quivering
with
fear
.
But
Maggie
became
*NL*
conscious
that
as
she
was
slackening
her
hold
her
father
was
beginning
*NL*
to
grasp
her
and
lean
on
her
.
The
surprise
checked
her
sobs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
feel
ill
--
faintish
,
''
he
said
.
``
Help
me
in
,
Bessy
--
I
'm
giddy
--
I
've
a
*NL*
pain
i
'
the
head
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
walked
in
slowly
,
propped
by
his
wife
and
daughter
and
tottered
*NL*
into
his
arm-chair
.
The
almost
purple
flush
had
given
way
to
paleness
,
*NL*
and
his
hand
was
cold
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Had
n't
we
better
send
for
the
doctor
?
''
said
Mrs.
Tulliver
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
seemed
to
be
too
faint
and
suffering
to
hear
her
;
but
presently
,
*NL*
when
she
said
to
Maggie
,
``
Go
and
seek
for
somebody
to
fetch
the
*NL*
doctor
,
''
he
looked
up
at
her
with
full
comprehension
,
and
said
,
*NL*
``
Doctor
?
No
--
no
doctor
.
It
's
my
head
,
that
's
all
.
Help
me
to
bed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sad
ending
to
the
day
that
had
risen
on
them
all
like
a
beginning
of
*NL*
better
times
!
But
mingled
seed
must
bear
a
mingled
crop
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
half
an
hour
after
his
father
had
lain
down
Tom
came
home
.
Bob
*NL*
Jakin
was
with
him
,
come
to
congratulate
``
the
old
master
,
''
not
without
*NL*
some
excusable
pride
that
he
had
had
his
share
in
bringing
about
Mr.
*NL*
Tom
's
good
luck
;
and
Tom
had
thought
his
father
would
like
nothing
*NL*
better
,
as
a
finish
to
the
day
,
than
a
talk
with
Bob
.
But
now
Tom
*NL*
could
only
spend
the
evening
in
gloomy
expectation
of
the
unpleasant
*NL*
consequences
that
must
follow
on
this
mad
outbreak
of
his
father
's
*NL*
long-smothered
hate
.
After
the
painful
news
had
been
told
,
he
sat
in
*NL*
silence
;
he
had
not
spirit
or
inclination
to
tell
his
mother
and
*NL*
sister
anything
about
the
dinner
;
they
hardly
cared
to
ask
it
.
*NL*
Apparently
the
mingled
thread
in
the
web
of
their
life
was
so
*NL*
curiously
twisted
together
that
there
could
be
no
joy
without
a
sorrow
*NL*
coming
close
upon
it
.
Tom
was
dejected
by
the
thought
that
his
*NL*
exemplary
effort
must
always
be
baffled
by
the
wrong-doing
of
others
;
*NL*
Maggie
was
living
through
,
over
and
over
again
,
the
agony
of
the
*NL*
moment
in
which
she
had
rushed
to
throw
herself
on
her
father
's
arm
,
*NL*
with
a
vague
,
shuddering
foreboding
of
wretched
scenes
to
come
.
Not
*NL*
one
of
the
three
felt
any
particular
alarm
about
Mr.
Tulliver
's
*NL*
health
;
the
symptoms
did
not
recall
his
former
dangerous
attack
,
and
*NL*
it
seemed
only
a
necessary
consequence
that
his
violent
passion
and
*NL*
effort
of
strength
,
after
many
hours
of
unusual
excitement
,
should
*NL*
have
made
him
feel
ill
.
Rest
would
probably
cure
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
,
tired
out
by
his
active
day
,
fell
asleep
soon
,
and
slept
soundly
;
*NL*
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
he
had
only
just
come
to
bed
,
when
he
waked
to
*NL*
see
his
mother
standing
by
him
in
the
gray
light
of
early
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
boy
,
you
must
get
up
this
minute
;
I
've
sent
for
the
doctor
,
and
*NL*
your
father
wants
you
and
Maggie
to
come
to
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
he
worse
,
mother
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
been
very
ill
all
night
with
his
head
,
but
he
does
n't
say
it
's
*NL*
worse
;
he
only
said
suddenly
,
`
Bessy
,
fetch
the
boy
and
girl
.
Tell
'em
*NL*
to
make
haste
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
and
Tom
threw
on
their
clothes
hastily
in
the
chill
gray
light
,
*NL*
and
reached
their
father
's
room
almost
at
the
same
moment
.
He
was
*NL*
watching
for
them
with
an
expression
of
pain
on
his
brow
,
but
with
*NL*
sharpened
,
anxious
consciousness
in
his
eyes
.
Mrs.
Tulliver
stood
at
*NL*
the
foot
of
the
bed
,
frightened
and
trembling
,
looking
worn
and
aged
*NL*
from
disturbed
rest
.
Maggie
was
at
the
bedside
first
,
but
her
father
's
*NL*
glance
was
toward
Tom
,
who
came
and
stood
next
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tom
,
my
lad
,
it
's
come
upon
me
as
I
sha
'n'
t
get
up
again
.
This
*NL*
world
's
been
too
many
for
me
,
my
lad
,
but
you
've
done
what
you
could
*NL*
to
make
things
a
bit
even
.
Shake
hands
wi
'
me
again
,
my
lad
,
before
I
*NL*
go
away
from
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
father
and
son
clasped
hands
and
looked
at
each
other
an
instant
.
*NL*
Then
Tom
said
,
trying
to
speak
firmly
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
any
wish
,
father
--
that
I
can
fulfil
,
when
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
my
lad
--
you
'll
try
and
get
the
old
mill
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
there
's
your
mother
--
you
'll
try
and
make
her
amends
,
all
you
can
,
*NL*
for
my
bad
luck
--
and
there
's
the
little
wench
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
father
turned
his
eyes
on
Maggie
with
a
still
more
eager
look
,
*NL*
while
she
,
with
a
bursting
heart
,
sank
on
her
knees
,
to
be
closer
to
*NL*
the
dear
,
time-worn
face
which
had
been
present
with
her
through
long
*NL*
years
,
as
the
sign
of
her
deepest
love
and
hardest
trial
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
take
care
of
her
,
Tom
--
do
n't
you
fret
,
my
wench
--
there
'll
*NL*
come
somebody
as
'll
love
you
and
take
your
part
--
and
you
must
be
good
*NL*
to
her
,
my
lad
.
I
was
good
to
_
my
_
sister
.
Kiss
me
,
Maggie
.
--
Come
,
*NL*
Bessy
.
--
You
'll
manage
to
pay
for
a
brick
grave
,
Tom
,
so
as
your
mother
*NL*
and
me
can
lie
together
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
away
from
them
all
when
he
had
said
this
,
and
lay
silent
for
*NL*
some
minutes
,
while
they
stood
watching
him
,
not
daring
to
move
.
The
*NL*
morning
light
was
growing
clearer
for
them
,
and
they
could
see
the
*NL*
heaviness
gathering
in
his
face
,
and
the
dulness
in
his
eyes
.
But
at
*NL*
last
he
looked
toward
Tom
and
said
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
my
turn
--
I
beat
him
.
That
was
nothing
but
fair
.
I
never
wanted
*NL*
anything
but
what
was
fair
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
father
,
dear
father
,
''
said
Maggie
,
an
unspeakable
anxiety
*NL*
predominating
over
her
grief
,
``
you
forgive
him
--
you
forgive
every
one
*NL*
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
move
his
eyes
to
look
at
her
,
but
he
said
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
my
wench
.
I
do
n't
forgive
him
.
What
's
forgiving
to
do
?
I
ca
n't
*NL*
love
a
raskill
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
voice
had
become
thicker
;
but
he
wanted
to
say
more
,
and
moved
his
*NL*
lips
again
and
again
,
struggling
in
vain
to
speak
.
At
length
the
words
*NL*
forced
their
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
God
forgive
raskills
?
--
but
if
He
does
,
He
wo
n't
be
hard
wi
'
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
hands
moved
uneasily
,
as
if
he
wanted
them
to
remove
some
*NL*
obstruction
that
weighed
upon
him
.
Two
or
three
times
there
fell
from
*NL*
him
some
broken
words
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
world
's
--
too
many
--
honest
man
--
puzzling
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Soon
they
merged
into
mere
mutterings
;
the
eyes
had
ceased
to
discern
;
*NL*
and
then
came
the
final
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
not
of
death
.
For
an
hour
or
more
the
chest
heaved
,
the
loud
,
hard
*NL*
breathing
continued
,
getting
gradually
slower
,
as
the
cold
dews
*NL*
gathered
on
the
brow
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
there
was
total
stillness
,
and
poor
Tulliver
's
dimly
lighted
*NL*
soul
had
forever
ceased
to
be
vexed
with
the
painful
riddle
of
this
*NL*
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
Help
was
come
now
;
Luke
and
his
wife
were
there
,
and
Mr.
Turnbull
had
*NL*
arrived
,
too
late
for
everything
but
to
say
,
``
This
is
death
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
and
Maggie
went
downstairs
together
into
the
room
where
their
*NL*
father
's
place
was
empty
.
Their
eyes
turned
to
the
same
spot
,
and
*NL*
Maggie
spoke
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tom
,
forgive
me
--
let
us
always
love
each
other
''
;
and
they
clung
and
*NL*
wept
together

triviality
in
the
action
with
the
scissors
,
but
your
*NL*
discernment
perceives
at
once
that
there
is
a
design
in
it
which
makes
*NL*
it
eminently
worthy
of
a
large-headed
,
long-limbed
young
man
;
for
you
*NL*
see
that
Lucy
wants
the
scissors
,
and
is
compelled
,
reluctant
as
she
*NL*
may
be
,
to
shake
her
ringlets
back
,
raise
her
soft
hazel
eyes
,
smile
*NL*
playfully
down
on
the
face
that
is
so
very
nearly
on
a
level
with
her
*NL*
knee
,
and
holding
out
her
little
shell-pink
palm
,
to
say
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
scissors
,
please
,
if
you
can
renounce
the
great
pleasure
of
*NL*
persecuting
my
poor
Minny
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
foolish
scissors
have
slipped
too
far
over
the
knuckles
,
it
seems
,
*NL*
and
Hercules
holds
out
his
entrapped
fingers
hopelessly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Confound
the
scissors
!
The
oval
lies
the
wrong
way
.
Please
draw
them
*NL*
off
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Draw
them
off
with
your
other
hand
,
''
says
Miss
Lucy
,
roguishly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
but
that
's
my
left
hand
;
I
'm
not
left-handed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
laughs
,
and
the
scissors
are
drawn
off
with
gentle
touches
from
*NL*
tiny
tips
,
which
naturally
dispose
Mr.
Stephen
for
a
repetition
_
da
*NL*
capo
_
.
Accordingly
,
he
watches
for
the
release
of
the
scissors
,
that
*NL*
he
may
get
them
into
his
possession
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
''
said
Lucy
,
sticking
them
in
her
band
,
``
you
shall
not
have
my
*NL*
scissors
again
,
--
you
have
strained
them
already
.
Now
do
n't
set
Minny
*NL*
growling
again
.
Sit
up
and
behave
properly
,
and
then
I
will
tell
you
*NL*
some
news
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
that
?
''
said
Stephen
,
throwing
himself
back
and
hanging
his
*NL*
right
arm
over
the
corner
of
his
chair
.
He
might
have
been
sitting
for
*NL*
his
portrait
,
which
would
have
represented
a
rather
striking
young
man
*NL*
of
five-and-twenty
,
with
a
square
forehead
,
short
dark-brown
hair
,
*NL*
standing
erect
,
with
a
slight
wave
at
the
end
,
like
a
thick
crop
of
*NL*
corn
,
and
a
half-ardent
,
half-sarcastic
glance
from
under
his
*NL*
well-marked
horizontal
eyebrows
.
``
Is
it
very
important
news

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
very

Guess

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
going

change
Minny

of
cream
daily

*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite

*NL*
``
Well

*NL*
*NL*
``
For

Lucy

adjusting
her
little

gravely
.

rather

pausing
in

with

look

slight
annoyance

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

that

nearly
two

poor

many

*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no

said
Lucy
,
with
a
little
air
of
pique
.
''
_
I
_
am
*NL*
pleased

but
that
,
of
course
,
is
no
reason
why

There

no

I
love
so
well
as
my

*NL*
Maggie

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
will
be
inseparable
I
suppose

when
she
comes

There
will
be
*NL*
no

tete-a-tete
_
with

any
more
,
unless
you
can
*NL*
find
an
admirer
for
her
,
who
will
pair
off
with
her
occasionally
.
What
*NL*
is
the
ground
of
dislike
to
Philip
?
He
might
have
been
a
resource
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
family
quarrel
with
Philip
's
father

There
were
very
painful
*NL*
circumstances
,
I
believe
.
I
never
quite
understood
them
,
or
knew
them
*NL*
all
.
My
uncle
Tulliver
was
unfortunate
and
lost
all
his
property
,
and
*NL*
I
think
he
considered
Mr.
Wakem
was
somehow
the
cause
of
it
.
Mr.
Wakem
*NL*
bought
Dorlcote
Mill
,
my
uncle
's
old
place
,
where
he
always
lived
.
You
*NL*
must
remember
my
uncle
Tulliver
,
do
n't
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Stephen
,
with
rather
supercilious
indifference
.
``
I
've
*NL*
always
known
the
name
,
and
I
dare
say
I
knew
the
man
by
sight
,
apart
*NL*
from
his
name
.
I
know
half
the
names
and
faces
in
the
neighborhood
in
*NL*
that
detached
,
disjointed
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
was
a
very
hot-tempered
man
.
I
remember
,
when
I
was
a
little
girl
*NL*
and
used
to
go
to
see
my
cousins
,
he
often
frightened
me
by
talking
as
*NL*
if
he
were
angry
.
Papa
told
me
there
was
a
dreadful
quarrel
,
the
very
*NL*
day
before
my
uncle
's
death
,
between
him
and
Mr.
Wakem
,
but
it
was
*NL*
hushed
up
.
That
was
when
you
were
in
London
.
Papa
says
my
uncle
was
*NL*
quite
mistaken
in
many
ways
;
his
mind
had
become
embittered
.
But
Tom
*NL*
and
Maggie
must
naturally
feel
it
very
painful
to
be
reminded
of
these
*NL*
things
.
They
have
had
so
much
,
so
very
much
trouble
.
Maggie
was
at
*NL*
school
with
me
six
years
ago
,
when
she
was
fetched
away
because
of
her
*NL*
father
's
misfortunes
,
and
she
has
hardly
had
any
pleasure
since
,
I
*NL*
think
.
She
has
been
in
a
dreary
situation
in
a
school
since
uncle
's
*NL*
death
,
because
she
is
determined
to
be
independent
,
and
not
live
with
*NL*
aunt
Pullet
;
and
I
could
hardly
wish
her
to
come
to
me
then
,
because
*NL*
dear
mamma
was
ill
,
and
everything
was
so
sad
.
That
is
why
I
want
her
*NL*
to
come
to
me
now
,
and
have
a
long
,
long
holiday
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
sweet
and
angelic
of
you
,
''
said
Stephen
,
looking
at
her
with
an
*NL*
admiring
smile
;
``
and
all
the
more
so
if
she
has
the
conversational
*NL*
qualities
of
her
mother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
aunty
!
You
are
cruel
to
ridicule
her
.
She
is
very
valuable
to
*NL*
_
me
_
,
I
know
.
She
manages
the
house
beautifully
,
--
much
better
than
any
*NL*
stranger
would
,
--
and
she
was
a
great
comfort
to
me
in
mamma
's
*NL*
illness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
in
point
of
companionship
one
would
prefer
that
she
should
*NL*
be
represented
by
her
brandy-cherries
and
cream-cakes
.
I
think
with
a
*NL*
shudder
that
her
daughter
will
always
be
present
in
person
,
and
have
*NL*
no
agreeable
proxies
of
that
kind
,
--
a
fat
,
blond
girl
,
with
round
blue
*NL*
eyes
,
who
will
stare
at
us
silently
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
!
''
exclaimed
Lucy
,
laughing
wickedly
,
and
clapping
her
hands
,
*NL*
``
that
is
just
my
cousin
Maggie
.
You
must
have
seen
her
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
indeed
;
I
'm
only
guessing
what
Mrs.
Tulliver
's
daughter
must
be
;
*NL*
and
then
if
she
is
to
banish
Philip
,
our
only
apology
for
a
tenor
,
*NL*
that
will
be
an
additional
bore
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
hope
that
may
not
be
.
I
think
I
will
ask
you
to
call
on
Philip
*NL*
and
tell
him
Maggie
is
coming
to-morrow
.
He
is
quite
aware
of
Tom
's
*NL*
feeling
,
and
always
keeps
out
of
his
way
;
so
he
will
understand
,
if
*NL*
you
tell
him
,
that
I
asked
you
to
warn
him
not
to
come
until
I
write
*NL*
to
ask
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
you
had
better
write
a
pretty
note
for
me
to
take
;
Phil
is
so
*NL*
sensitive
,
you
know
,
the
least
thing
might
frighten
him
off
coming
at
*NL*
all
,
and
we
had
hard
work
to
get
him
.
I
can
never
induce
him
to
come
*NL*
to
the
park
;
he
does
n't
like
my
sisters
,
I
think
.
It
is
only
your
*NL*
faery
touch
that
can
lay
his
ruffled
feathers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
mastered
the
little
hand
that
was
straying
toward
the
table
,
*NL*
and
touched
it
lightly
with
his
lips
.
Little
Lucy
felt
very
proud
and
*NL*
happy
.
She
and
Stephen
were
in
that
stage
of
courtship
which
makes
the
*NL*
most
exquisite
moment
of
youth
,
the
freshest
blossom-time
of
*NL*
passion
,
--
when
each
is
sure
of
the
other
's
love
,
but
no
formal
*NL*
declaration
has
been
made
,
and
all
is
mutual
divination
,
exalting
the
*NL*
most
trivial
word
,
the
lightest
gesture
,
into
thrills
delicate
and
*NL*
delicious
as
wafted
jasmine
scent
.
The
explicitness
of
an
engagement
*NL*
wears
off
this
finest
edge
of
susceptibility
;
it
is
jasmine
gathered
*NL*
and
presented
in
a
large
bouquet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
is
really
odd
that
you
should
have
hit
so
exactly
on

*NL*
appearance

''
said
the
cunning
Lucy
,
moving
to
reach
her
*NL*
desk

``

she
might
have
been

of
their

interminable
discussions

They
think
of
doing
something

he
saved
them
from
a
considerable
loss

riding

home

bring

stoppage

Stephen
rose
from

seat

sauntered
to
the
piano

humming
in
*NL*
falsetto
,
``
Graceful
Consort

as
he
turned
over
the
volume

stood
open

beginning
to
play
the
duet
.
*NL*
*NL*
Surely
the
only
courtship
unshaken
by
doubts
and
fears
must
be
that
in
*NL*
which
the
lovers
can
sing
together
.
The
sense
of
mutual
fitness
that
*NL*
springs
from
the
two
deep
notes
fulfilling
expectation
just
at
the
*NL*
right
moment
between
the
notes
of
the
silvery
soprano
,
from
the
*NL*
perfect
accord
of
descending
thirds
and
fifths
,
from
the
preconcerted
*NL*
loving
chase
of
a
fugue
,
is
likely
enough
to
supersede
any
immediate
*NL*
demand
for
less
impassioned
forms
of
agreement
.
The
contralto
will
not
*NL*
care
to
catechise
the
bass
;
the
tenor
will
foresee
no
embarrassing
*NL*
dearth
of
remark
in
evenings
spent
with
the
lovely
soprano
.
In
the
*NL*
provinces
,
too
,
where
music
was
so
scarce
in
that
remote
time
,
how
*NL*
could
the
musical
people
avoid
falling
in
love
with
each
other
?
Even
*NL*
political
principle
must
have
been
in
danger
of
relaxation
under
such
*NL*
circumstances
;
and
the
violin
,
faithful
to
rotten
boroughs
,
must
have
*NL*
been
tempted
to
fraternize
in
a
demoralizing
way
with
a
reforming
*NL*
violoncello
.
In
that
case
,
the
linnet-throated
soprano
and
the
*NL*
full-toned
bass
singing
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
thee
delight
is
ever
new
,
*NL*
With
thee
is
life
incessant
bliss
,
''
*NL*
*NL*
believed
what
they
sang
all
the
more
_
because
_
they
sang
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
for
Raphael
's
great
song
,
''
said
Lucy
,
when
they
had
finished
the
*NL*
duet
.
``
You
do
the
`
heavy
beasts
'
to
perfection
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
sounds
complimentary
,
''
said
Stephen
,
looking
at
his
watch
.
``
By
*NL*
Jove
,
it
's
nearly
half-past
one
!
Well
,
I
can
just
sing
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
delivered
with
admirable
ease
the
deep
notes
representing
the
*NL*
tread
of
the
heavy
beasts
;
but
when
a
singer
has
an
audience
of
two
,
*NL*
there
is
room
for
divided
sentiments
.
Minny
's
mistress
was
charmed
;
*NL*
but
Minny
,
who
had
intrenched
himself
,
trembling
,
in
his
basket
as
*NL*
soon
as
the
music
began
,
found
this
thunder
so
little
to
his
taste
*NL*
that
he
leaped
out
and
scampered
under
the
remotest
_
chiffonnier
_
,
as
*NL*
the
most
eligible
place
in
which
a
small
dog
could
await
the
crack
of
*NL*
doom
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Adieu
,
`
graceful
consort
,
'
''
said
Stephen
,
buttoning
his
coat
across
*NL*
when
he
had
done
singing
,
and
smiling
down
from
his
tall
height
,
with
*NL*
the
air
of
rather
a
patronizing
lover
,
at
the
little
lady
on
the
*NL*
music-stool
.
``
My
bliss
is
not
incessant
,
for
I
must
gallop
home
.
I
*NL*
promised
to
be
there
at
lunch
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
not
be
able
to
call
on
Philip
,
then
?
It
is
of
no
*NL*
consequence
;
I
have
said
everything
in
my
note
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
be
engaged
with
your
cousin
to-morrow
,
I
suppose
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
we
are
going
to
have
a
little
family-party
.
My
cousin
Tom
will
*NL*
dine
with
us
;
and
poor
aunty
will
have
her
two
children
together
for
*NL*
the
first
time
.
It
will
be
very
pretty
;
I
think
a
great
deal
about
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
may
come
the
next
day
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
!
Come
and
be
introduced
to
my
cousin
Maggie
;
though
you
can
*NL*
hardly
be
said
not
to
have
seen
her
,
you
have
described
her
so
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-bye
,
then
.
''
And
there
was
that
slight
pressure
of
the
hands
,
and
*NL*
momentary
meeting
of
the
eyes
,
which
will
often
leave
a
little
lady
*NL*
with
a
slight
flush
and
smile
on
her
face
that
do
not
subside
*NL*
immediately
when
the
door
is
closed
,
and
with
an
inclination
to
walk
*NL*
up
and
down
the
room
rather
than
to
seat
herself
quietly
at
her
*NL*
embroidery
,
or
other
rational
and
improving
occupation
.
At
least
this
*NL*
was
the
effect
on
Lucy
;
and
you
will
not
,
I
hope
,
consider
it
an
*NL*
indication
of
vanity
predominating
over
more
tender
impulses
,
that
she
*NL*
just
glanced
in
the
chimney-glass
as
her
walk
brought
her
near
it
.
The
*NL*
desire
to
know
that
one
has
not
looked
an
absolute
fright
during
a
few
*NL*
hours
of
conversation
may
be
construed
as
lying
within
the
bounds
of
a
*NL*
laudable
benevolent
consideration
for
others
.
And
Lucy
had
so
much
of
*NL*
this
benevolence
in
her
nature
that
I
am
inclined
to
think
her
small
*NL*
egoisms
were
impregnated
with
it
,
just
as
there
are
people
not
*NL*
altogether
unknown
to
you
whose
small
benevolences
have
a
predominant
*NL*
and
somewhat
rank
odor
of
egoism
.
Even
now
,
that
she
is
walking
up
and
*NL*
down
with
a
little
triumphant
flutter
of
her
girlish
heart
at
the
*NL*
sense
that
she
is
loved
by
the
person
of
chief
consequence
in
her
*NL*
small
world
,
you
may
see
in
her
hazel
eyes
an
ever-present
sunny
*NL*
benignity
,
in
which
the
momentary
harmless
flashes
of
personal
vanity
*NL*
are
quite
lost
;
and
if
she
is
happy
in
thinking
of
her
lover
,
it
is
*NL*
because
the
thought
of
him
mingles
readily
with
all
the
gentle
*NL*
affections
and
good-natured
offices
with
which
she
fills
her
peaceful
*NL*
days
.
Even
now
,
her
mind
,
with
that
instantaneous
alternation
which
*NL*
makes
two
currents
of
feeling
or
imagination
seem
simultaneous
,
is
*NL*
glancing
continually
from
Stephen
to
the
preparations
she
has
only
*NL*
half
finished
in
Maggie
's
room
.
Cousin
Maggie
should
be
treated
as
*NL*
well
as
the
grandest
lady-visitor
,
--
nay
,
better
,
for
she
should
have
*NL*
Lucy
's
best
prints
and
drawings
in
her
bedroom
,
and
the
very
finest
*NL*
bouquet
of
spring
flowers
on
her
table
.
Maggie
would
enjoy
all
that
,
*NL*
she
was
so
found
of
pretty
things
!
And
there
was
poor
aunt
Tulliver
,
*NL*
that
no
one
made
any
account
of
,
she
was
to
be
surprised
with
the
*NL*
present
of
a
cap
of
superlative
quality
,
and
to
have
her
health
drunk
*NL*
in
a
gratifying
manner
,
for
which
Lucy
was
going
to
lay
a
plot
with
*NL*
her
father
this
evening
.
Clearly
,
she
had
not
time
to
indulge
in
long
*NL*
reveries
about
her
own
happy
love-affairs
.
With
this
thought
she
*NL*
walked
toward
the
door
,
but
paused
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
matter
,
then
,
Minny
?
''
she
said
,
stooping
in
answer
to
some
*NL*
whimpering
of
that
small
quadruped
,
and
lifting
his
glossy
head
*NL*
against
her
pink
cheek
.
``
Did
you
think
I
was
going
without
you
?
Come
,
*NL*
then
,
let
us
go
and
see
Sinbad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sinbad
was
Lucy
's
chestnut
horse
,
that
she
always
fed
with
her
own
*NL*
hand
when
he
was
turned
out
in
the
paddock
.
She
was
fond
of
feeding
*NL*
dependent
creatures
,
and
knew
the
private
tastes
of
all
the
animals
*NL*
about
the
house
,
delighting
in
the
little
rippling
sounds
of
her
*NL*
canaries
when
their
beaks
were
busy
with
fresh
seed
,
and
in
the
small
*NL*
nibbling
pleasures
of
certain
animals
which
,
lest
she
should
appear
*NL*
too
trivial
,
I
will
here
call
``
the
more
familiar
rodents
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Was
not
Stephen
Guest
right
in
his
decided
opinion
that
this
slim
*NL*
maiden
of
eighteen
was
quite
the
sort
of
wife
a
man
would
not
be
*NL*
likely
to
repent
of
marrying
,
--
a
woman
who
was
loving
and
thoughtful
*NL*
for
other
women
,
not
giving
them
Judas-kisses
with
eyes
askance
on
*NL*
their
welcome
defects
,
but
with
real
care
and
vision
for
their
*NL*
half-hidden
pains
and
mortifications
,
with
long
ruminating
enjoyment
*NL*
of
little
pleasures
prepared
for
them
?
Perhaps
the
emphasis
of
his
*NL*
admiration
did
not
fall
precisely
on
this
rarest
quality
in
her
;
*NL*
perhaps
he
approved
his
own
choice
of
her
chiefly
because
she
did
not
*NL*
strike
him
as
a
remarkable
rarity
.
A
man
likes
his
wife
to
be
pretty
;
*NL*
well
,
Lucy
was
pretty
,
but
not
to
a
maddening
extent
.
A
man
likes
his
*NL*
wife
to
be
accomplished
,
gentle
,
affectionate
,
and
not
stupid
;
and
*NL*
Lucy
had
all
these
qualifications
.
Stephen
was
not
surprised
to
find
*NL*
himself
in
love
with
her
,
and
was
conscious
of
excellent
judgment
in
*NL*
preferring
her
to
Miss
Leyburn
,
the
daughter
of
the
county
member
,
*NL*
although
Lucy
was
only
the
daughter
of
his
father
's
subordinate
*NL*
partner
;
besides
,
he
had
had
to
defy
and
overcome
a
slight
*NL*
unwillingness
and
disappointment
in
his
father
and
sisters
,
--
a
*NL*
circumstance
which
gives
a
young
man
an
agreeable
consciousness
of
his
*NL*
own
dignity
.
Stephen
was
aware
that
he
had
sense
and
independence
*NL*
enough
to
choose
the
wife
who
was
likely
to
make
him
happy
,
unbiassed
*NL*
by
any
indirect
considerations
.
He
meant
to
choose
Lucy
;
she
was
a
*NL*
little
darling
,
and
exactly
the
sort
of
woman
he
had
always
admired
.

``
He
is
very
clever
,
Maggie
,
''
said
Lucy
.
She
was
kneeling
on
a
*NL*
footstool
at
Maggie
's
feet
,
after
placing
that
dark
lady
in
the
large
*NL*
crimson-velvet
chair
.
``
I
feel
sure
you
will
like
him
.
I
hope
you
*NL*
will
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
be
very
difficult
to
please
,
''
said
Maggie
,
smiling
,
and
*NL*
holding
up
one
of
Lucy
's
long
curls
,
that
the
sunlight
might
shine
*NL*
through
it
.
``
A
gentleman
who
thinks
he
is
good
enough
for
Lucy
must
*NL*
expect
to
be
sharply
criticised
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
he
's
a
great
deal
too
good
for
me
.
And
sometimes
,
when
he
is
*NL*
away
,
I
almost
think
it
ca
n't
really
be
that
he
loves
me
.
But
I
can
*NL*
never
doubt
it
when
he
is
with
me
,
though
I
could
n't
bear
any
one
but
*NL*
you
to
know
that
I
feel
in
that
way
,
Maggie
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
then
,
if
I
disapprove
of
him
you
can
give
him
up
,
since
you
are
*NL*
not
engaged
,
''
said
Maggie
,
with
playful
gravity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
rather
not
be
engaged
.
When
people
are
engaged
,
they
begin
to
*NL*
think
of
being
married
soon
,
''
said
Lucy
,
too
thoroughly
preoccupied
to
*NL*
notice
Maggie
's
joke
;
``
and
I
should
like
everything
to
go
on
for
a
*NL*
long
while
just
as
it
is
.
Sometimes
I
am
quite
frightened
lest
Stephen
*NL*
should
say
that
he
has
spoken
to
papa
;
and
from
something
that
fell
*NL*
from
papa
the
other
day
,
I
feel
sure
he
and
Mr.
Guest
are
expecting
*NL*
that
.
And
Stephen
's
sisters
are
very
civil
to
me
now
.
At
first
,
I
*NL*
think
they
did
n't
like
his
paying
me
attention
;
and
that
was
natural
.
*NL*
It
_
does
_
seem
out
of
keeping
that
I
should
ever
live
in
a
great
place
*NL*
like
the
Park
House
,
such
a
little
insignificant
thing
as
I
am
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
people
are
not
expected
to
be
large
in
proportion
to
the
houses
*NL*
they
live
in
,
like
snails

''
said
Maggie
,
laughing
.
``
Pray
,
are
Mr.
*NL*
Guest

sisters
giantesses
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no

and
not
handsome

--
that

said
Lucy
,
*NL*
half-penitent
at
this
uncharitable
remark
.
``
But
_
he

at
least
he
*NL*
is
generally
considered
very
handsome

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
Lucy

blushing
pink
over
brow

neck
.
``
It

is
a
bad
plan

raise
expectation

you

prepared

have
a

glorious
laugh

I
shall
not

''
*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
rose
from
her
knees
and
went
to
a
little
distance
,
holding
her
*NL*
pretty
head
on
one
side
,
as
if
she
had
been
arranging
Maggie
for
a
*NL*
portrait
,
and
wished
to
judge
of
the
general
effect
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stand
up
a
moment
,
Maggie
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
your
pleasure
now
?
''
said
Maggie
,
smiling
languidly
as
she
*NL*
rose
from
her
chair
and
looked
down
on
her
slight
,
aerial
cousin
,
*NL*
whose
figure
was
quite
subordinate
to
her
faultless
drapery
of
silk
*NL*
and
crape
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
kept
her
contemplative
attitude
a
moment
or
two
in
silence
,
and
*NL*
then
said
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
think
what
witchery
it
is
in
you
,
Maggie
,
that
makes
you
look
*NL*
best
in
shabby
clothes
;
though
you
really
must
have
a
new
dress
now
.
*NL*
But
do
you
know
,
last
night
I
was
trying
to
fancy
you
in
a
handsome
,
*NL*
fashionable
dress
,
and
do
what
I
would
,
that
old
limp
merino
would
*NL*
come
back
as
the
only
right
thing
for
you
.
I
wonder
if
Marie
*NL*
Antoinette
looked
all
the
grander
when
her
gown
was
darned
at
the
*NL*
elbows
.
Now
,
if
_
I
_
were
to
put
anything
shabby
on
,
I
should
be
quite
*NL*
unnoticeable
.
I
should
be
a
mere
rag
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
quite
,
''
said
Maggie
,
with
mock
gravity
.
``
You
would
be
liable
to
*NL*
be
swept
out
of
the
room
with
the
cobwebs
and
carpet-dust
,
and
to
find
*NL*
yourself
under
the
grate
,
like
Cinderella
.
May
n't
I
sit
down
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
now
you
may
,
''
said
Lucy
,
laughing
.
Then
,
with
an
air
of
serious
*NL*
reflection
,
unfastening
her
large
jet
brooch
,
``
But
you
must
change
*NL*
brooches
,
Maggie
;
that
little
butterfly
looks
silly
on
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
wo
n't
that
mar
the
charming
effect
of
my
consistent
shabbiness
?
''
*NL*
said
Maggie
,
seating
herself
submissively
,
while
Lucy
knelt
again
and
*NL*
unfastened
the
contemptible
butterfly
.
``
I
wish
my
mother
were
of
your
*NL*
opinion
,
for
she
was
fretting
last
night
because
this
is
my
best
*NL*
frock
.
I
've
been
saving
my
money
to
pay
for
some
lessons
;
I
shall
*NL*
never
get
a
better
situation
without
more
accomplishments
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
gave
a
little
sigh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
do
n't
put
on
that
sad
look
again
,
''
said
Lucy
,
pinning
the
large
*NL*
brooch
below
Maggie
's
fine
throat
.
``
You
're
forgetting
that
you
've
left
*NL*
that
dreary
schoolroom
behind
you
,
and
have
no
little
girls
'
clothes
*NL*
to
mend
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Maggie
.
``
It
is
with
me
as
I
used
to
think
it
would
be
with
*NL*
the
poor
uneasy
white
bear
I
saw
at
the
show
.
I
thought
he
must
have
*NL*
got
so
stupid
with
the
habit
of
turning
backward
and
forward
in
that
*NL*
narrow
space
that
he
would
keep
doing
it
if
they
set
him
free
.
One
*NL*
gets
a
bad
habit
of
being
unhappy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
shall
put
you
under
a
discipline
of
pleasure
that
will
make
you
*NL*
lose
that
bad
habit

''
said
Lucy
,
sticking
the
black
butterfly
absently
*NL*
in
her
own
collar
,
while
her
eyes
met
Maggie
's
affectionately
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
dear
,
tiny
thing
,
''
said
Maggie
,
in
one
of
her
bursts
of
loving
*NL*
admiration
,
``
you
enjoy
other
people
's
happiness
so
much
,
I
believe
you
*NL*
would
do
without
any
of
your
own
.
I
wish
I
were
like
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
never
been
tried
in
that
way
,
''
said
Lucy
.
``
I
've
always
been
so
*NL*
happy
.
I
do
n't
know
whether
I
could
bear
much
trouble
;
I
never
had
any
*NL*
but
poor
mamma
's
death
.
You
_
have
_
been
tried
,
Maggie
;
and
I
'm
sure
*NL*
you
feel
for
other
people
quite
as
much
as
I
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Lucy
,
''
said
Maggie
,
shaking
her
head
slowly
,
``
I
do
n't
enjoy
their
*NL*
happiness
as
you
do
,
else
I
should
be
more
contented

I
do
feel
for
*NL*
them
when
they
are
in
trouble
;
I
do
n't
think
I
could
ever
bear
to
make
*NL*
any
one
_
un_happy
;
and
yet
I
often
hate
myself
,
because
I
get
angry
*NL*
sometimes
at
the
sight
of
happy
people
.
I
think
I
get
worse
as
I
get
*NL*
older
,
more
selfish
.
That
seems
very
dreadful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Maggie
!
''
said
Lucy
,
in
a
tone
of
remonstrance
,
``
I
do
n't
believe
*NL*
a
word
of
that
.
It
is
all
a
gloomy
fancy
,
just
because
you
are
*NL*
depressed
by
a
dull
,
wearisome
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
perhaps
it
is
,
''
said
Maggie
,
resolutely
clearing
away
the
*NL*
clouds
from
her
face
with
a
bright
smile
,
and
throwing
herself
*NL*
backward
in
her
chair
.
``
Perhaps
it
comes
from
the
school
diet
,
--
watery
*NL*
rice-pudding
spiced
with
Pinnock
.
Let
us
hope
it
will
give
way
before
*NL*
my
mother
's
custards
and
this
charming
Geoffrey
Crayon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
took
up
the
``
Sketch
Book
,
''
which
lay
by
her
on
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
I
look
fit
to
be
seen
with
this
little
brooch
?
''
said
Lucy
,
going
*NL*
to
survey
the
effect
in
the
chimney-glass
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
,
Mr.
Guest
will
be
obliged
to
go
out
of
the
room
again
if
he
*NL*
sees
you
in
it
.
Pray
make
haste
and
put
another
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
hurried
out
of
the
room
,
but
Maggie
did
not
take
the
opportunity
*NL*
of
opening
her
book
;
she
let
it
fall
on
her
knees
,
while
her
eyes
*NL*
wandered
to
the
window
,
where
she
could
see
the
sunshine
falling
on
*NL*
the
rich
clumps
of
spring
flowers
and
on
the
long
hedge
of
laurels
,
*NL*
and
beyond
,
the
silvery
breadth
of
the
dear
old
Floss
,
that
at
this
*NL*
distance
seemed
to
be
sleeping
in
a
morning
holiday
.
The
sweet
fresh
*NL*
garden-scent
came
through
the
open
window
,
and
the
birds
were
busy
*NL*
flitting
and
alighting
,
gurgling
and
singing
.
Yet
Maggie
's
eyes
began
*NL*
to
fill
with
tears
.
The
sight
of
the
old
scenes
had
made
the
rush
of
*NL*
memories
so
painful
that
even
yesterday
she
had
only
been
able
to
*NL*
rejoice
in
her
mother
's
restored
comfort
and
Tom
's
brotherly
*NL*
friendliness
as
we
rejoice
in
good
news
of
friends
at
a
distance
,
*NL*
rather
than
in
the
presence
of
a
happiness
which
we
share
.
Memory
and
*NL*
imagination
urged
upon
her
a
sense
of
privation
too
keen
to
let
her
*NL*
taste
what
was
offered
in
the
transient
present
.
Her
future
,
she
*NL*
thought
,
was
likely
to
be
worse
than
her
past
,
for
after
her
years
of
*NL*
contented
renunciation
,
she
had
slipped
back
into
desire
and
longing
;
*NL*
she
found
joyless
days
of
distasteful
occupation
harder
and
harder
;
*NL*
she
found
the
image
of
the
intense
and
varied
life
she
yearned
for
,
*NL*
and
despaired
of
,
becoming
more
and
more
importunate
.
The
sound
of
the
*NL*
opening
door
roused
her
,
and
hastily
wiping
away
her
tears
,
she
began
*NL*
to
turn
over
the
leaves
of
her
book
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
one
pleasure
,
I
know
,
Maggie
,
that
your
deepest
dismalness
*NL*
will
never
resist
,
''
said
Lucy
,
beginning
to
speak
as
soon
as
she
*NL*
entered
the
room
.
``
That
is
music
,
and
I
mean
you
to
have
quite
a
*NL*
riotous
feast
of
it
.
I
mean
you
to
get
up
your
playing
again
,
which
*NL*
used
to
be
so
much
better
than
mine
,
when
we
were
at
Laceham
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
would
have
laughed
to
see
me
playing
the
little
girls
'
tunes
over
*NL*
and
over
to
them
,
when
I
took
them
to
practise
,
''
said
Maggie
,
``
just
*NL*
for
the
sake
of
fingering
the
dear
keys
again
.
But
I
do
n't
know
*NL*
whether
I
could
play
anything
more
difficult
now
than
`
Begone
,
dull
*NL*
care
!
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
what
a
wild
state
of
joy
you
used
to
be
in
when
the
glee-men
*NL*
came
round
,
''
said
Lucy
,
taking
up
her
embroidery
;
``
and
we
might
have
*NL*
all
those
old
glees
that
you
used
to
love
so
,
if
I
were
certain
that
*NL*
you
do
n't
feel
exactly
as
Tom
does
about
some
things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
have
thought
there
was
nothing
you
might
be
more
certain
*NL*
of
,
''
said
Maggie
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ought
rather
to
have
said
,
one
particular
thing
.
Because
if
you
*NL*
feel
just
as
he
does
about
that
,
we
shall
want
our
third
voice
.
St.
*NL*
Ogg
's
is
so
miserably
provided
with
musical
gentlemen
.
There
are
*NL*
really
only
Stephen
and
Philip
Wakem
who
have
any
knowledge
of
music
,
*NL*
so
as
to
be
able
to
sing
a
part
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
had
looked
up
from
her
work
as
she
uttered
the
last
sentence
,
and
*NL*
saw
that
there
was
a
change
in
Maggie
's
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
it
hurt
you
to
hear
the
name
mentioned
,
Maggie
?
If
it
does
,
I
*NL*
will
not
speak
of
him
again
.
I
know
Tom
will
not
see
him
if
he
can
*NL*
avoid
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
feel
at
all
as
Tom
does
on
that
subject
,
''
said
Maggie
,
rising
*NL*
and
going
to
the
window
as
if
she
wanted
to
see
more
of
the
landscape
.
*NL*
``
I
've
always
liked
Philip
Wakem
ever
since
I
was
a
little
girl
,
and
*NL*
saw
him
at
Lorton
.
He
was
so
good
when
Tom
hurt
his
foot
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
'm
so
glad
!
''
said
Lucy
.
``
Then
you
wo
n't
mind
his
coming
*NL*
sometimes
,
and
we
can
have
much
more
music
than
we
could
without
him
.
*NL*
I
'm
very
fond
of
poor
Philip
,
only
I
wish
he
were
not
so
morbid
about
*NL*
his
deformity
.
I
suppose
it
_
is
_
his
deformity
that
makes
him
so
sad
,
*NL*
and
sometimes
bitter
.
It
is
certainly
very
piteous
to
see
his
poor
*NL*
little
crooked
body
and
pale
face
among
great
,
strong
people
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
Lucy
--
''
said
Maggie
,
trying
to
arrest
the
prattling
stream
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
there
is
the
door-bell
.
That
must
be
Stephen
,
''
Lucy
went
on
,
not
*NL*
noticing
Maggie
's
faint
effort
to
speak
.
``
One
of
the
things
I
most
*NL*
admire
in
Stephen
is
that
he
makes
a
greater
friend
of
Philip
than
any
*NL*
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
too
late
for
Maggie
to
speak
now
;
the
drawingroom
door
was
*NL*
opening
,
and
Minny
was
already
growling
in
a
small
way
at
the
entrance
*NL*
of
a
tall
gentleman
,
who
went
up
to
Lucy
and
took
her
hand
with
a
*NL*
half-polite
,
half-tender
glance
and
tone
of
inquiry
,
which
seemed
to
*NL*
indicate
that
he
was
unconscious
of
any
other
presence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
introduce
you
to
my
cousin
,
Miss
Tulliver
,
''
said
Lucy
,
turning
*NL*
with
wicked
enjoyment
toward
Maggie
,
who
now
approached
from
the
*NL*
farther
window
.
``
This
is
Mr.
Stephen
Guest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
one
instant
Stephen
could
not
conceal
his
astonishment
at
the
*NL*
sight
of
this
tall
,
dark-eyed
nymph
with
her
jet-black
coronet
of
*NL*
hair
;
the
next
,
Maggie
felt
herself
,
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
,
*NL*
receiving
the
tribute
of
a
very
deep
blush
and
a
very
deep
bow
from
a
*NL*
person
toward
whom
she
herself
was
conscious
of
timidity
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
new
experience
was
very
agreeable
to
her
,
so
agreeable
that
it
*NL*
almost
effaced
her
previous
emotion
about
Philip
.
There
was
a
new
*NL*
brightness
in
her
eyes
,
and
a
very
becoming
flush
on
her
cheek
,
as
she
*NL*
seated
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
you
perceive
what
a
striking
likeness
you
drew
the
day
before
*NL*
yesterday
,
''
said
Lucy
,
with
a
pretty
laugh
of
triumph
.
She
enjoyed
her
*NL*
lover
's
confusion
;
the
advantage
was
usually
on
his
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
designing
cousin
of
yours
quite
deceived
me
,
Miss
Tulliver
,
''
*NL*
said
Stephen
,
seating
himself
by
Lucy
,
and
stooping
to
play
with
*NL*
Minny
,
only
looking
at
Maggie
furtively
.
``
She
said
you
had
light
hair
*NL*
and
blue
eyes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
it
was
you
who
said
so
,
''
remonstrated
Lucy
.
``
I
only
refrained
*NL*
from
destroying
your
confidence
in
your
own
second-sight
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
I
could
always
err
in
the
same
way
,
''
said
Stephen
,
``
and
find
*NL*
reality
so
much
more
beautiful
than
my
preconceptions
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
you
have
proved
yourself
equal
to
the
occasion
,
''
said
Maggie
,
*NL*
``
and
said
what
it
was
incumbent
on
you
to
say
under
the
*NL*
circumstances
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
flashed
a
slightly
defiant
look
at
him
;
it
was
clear
to
her
that
*NL*
he
had
been
drawing
a
satirical
portrait
of
her
beforehand
.
Lucy
had
*NL*
said
he
was
inclined
to
be
satirical
,
and
Maggie
had
mentally
supplied
*NL*
the
addition
,
``
and
rather
conceited
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
alarming
amount
of
devil
there
,
''
was
Stephen
's
first
thought
.
The
*NL*
second
,
when
she
had
bent
over
her
work
,
was
,
``
I
wish
she
would
look
*NL*
at
me
again
.
''
The
next
was
to
answer
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
all
phrases
of
mere
compliment
have
their
turn
to
be
true
.
*NL*
A
man
is
occasionally
grateful
when
he
says
`
Thank
you
.
'
It
's
rather
*NL*
hard
upon
him
that
he
must
use
the
same
words
with
which
all
the
world
*NL*
declines
a
disagreeable
invitation
,
do
n't
you
think
so
,
Miss
*NL*
Tulliver
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Maggie
,
looking
at
him
with
her
direct
glance
;
``
if
we
use
*NL*
common
words
on
a
great
occasion
,
they
are
the
more
striking
,
because
*NL*
they
are
felt
at
once
to
have
a
particular
meaning
,
like
old
banners
,
*NL*
or
every-day
clothes
,
hung
up
in
a
sacred
place
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
my
compliment
ought
to
be
eloquent
,
''
said
Stephen
,
really
not
*NL*
quite
knowing
what
he
said
while
Maggie
looked
at
him
,
``
seeing
that
*NL*
the
words
were
so
far
beneath
the
occasion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
compliment
can
be
eloquent
,
except
as
an
expression
of
*NL*
indifference
,
''
said
Maggie
,
flushing
a
little
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
was
rather
alarmed
;
she
thought
Stephen
and
Maggie
were
not
going
*NL*
to
like
each
other
.
She
had
always
feared
lest
Maggie
should
appear
*NL*
too
old
and
clever
to
please
that
critical
gentleman
.
``
Why
,
dear
*NL*
Maggie
,
''
she
interposed
,
``
you
have
always
pretended
that
you
are
too
*NL*
fond
of
being
admired
;
and
now
,
I
think
,
you
are
angry
because
some
*NL*
one
ventures
to
admire
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all
,
''
said
Maggie
;
``
I
like
too
well
to
feel
that
I
am
admired

*NL*
but
compliments
never
make
me
feel
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
never
pay
you
a
compliment
again
,
Miss
Tulliver
,
''
said

Stephen
.

*NL*
``
Thank
you

that
will
be

*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Maggie
!
She
was
so
unused
to
society
that
she
could
take
nothing
*NL*
as
a
matter
of
course
,
and
had
never
in
her
life
spoken
from
the
lips
*NL*
merely
,
so
that
she
must
necessarily
appear
absurd
to
more
experienced
*NL*
ladies
,
from
the
excessive
feeling
she
was
apt
to
throw
into
very
*NL*
trivial
incidents
.
But
she
was
even
conscious
herself
of
a
little
*NL*
absurdity
in
this
instance
.
It
was
true
she
had
a
theoretic
objection
*NL*
to
compliments
,
and
had
once
said
impatiently
to
Philip
that
she
*NL*
did
n't
see
why
women
were
to
be
told
with
a
simper
that
they
were
*NL*
beautiful
,
any
more
than
old
men
were
to
be
told
that
they
were
*NL*
venerable
;
still
,
to
be
so
irritated
by
a
common
practice
in
the
case
*NL*
of
a
stranger
like
Mr.
Stephen
Guest
,
and
to
care
about
his
having
*NL*
spoken
slightingly
of
her
before
he
had
seen
her
,
was
certainly
*NL*
unreasonable
,
and
as
soon
as
she
was
silent
she
began
to
be
ashamed
of
*NL*
herself
.
It
did
not
occur
to
her
that
her
irritation
was
due
to
the
*NL*
pleasanter
emotion
which
preceded
it
,
just
as
when
we
are
satisfied
*NL*
with
a
sense
of
glowing
warmth
an
innocent
drop
of
cold
water
may
fall
*NL*
upon
us
as
a
sudden
smart
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
was
too
well
bred
not
to
seem
unaware
that
the
previous
*NL*
conversation
could
have
been
felt
embarrassing
,
and
at
once
began
to
*NL*
talk
of
impersonal
matters
,
asking
Lucy
if
she
knew
when
the
bazaar
*NL*
was
at
length
to
take
place
,
so
that
there
might
be
some
hope
of
*NL*
seeing
her
rain
the
influence
of
her
eyes
on
objects
more
grateful
*NL*
than
those
worsted
flowers
that
were
growing
under
her
fingers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Some
day
next
month
,
I
believe
,
''
said
Lucy
.
``
But
your
sisters
are
*NL*
doing
more
for
it
than
I
am
;
they
are
to
have
the
largest
stall
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
yes
;
but
they
carry
on
their
manufactures
in
their
own
*NL*
sitting-room
,
where
I
do
n't
intrude
on
them
.
I
see
you
are
not
*NL*
addicted
to
the
fashionable
vice
of
fancy-work
,
Miss
Tulliver
,
''
said
*NL*
Stephen
,
looking
at
Maggie
's
plain
hemming
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Maggie
,
``
I
can
do
nothing
more
difficult
or
more
elegant
*NL*
than
shirt-making
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
your
plain
sewing
is
so
beautiful
,
Maggie
,
''
said
Lucy
,
``
that
I
*NL*
think
I
shall
beg
a
few
specimens
of
you
to
show
as
fancy-work
.
Your
*NL*
exquisite
sewing
is
quite
a
mystery
to
me
,
you
used
to
dislike
that
*NL*
sort
of
work
so
much
in
old
days
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
mystery
easily
explained
,
dear
,
''
said
Maggie
,
looking
up
*NL*
quietly
.
``
Plain
sewing
was
the
only
thing
I
could
get
money
by
,
so
I
*NL*
was
obliged
to
try
and
do
it
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
,
good
and
simple
as
she
was
,
could
not
help
blushing
a
little
.
*NL*
She
did
not
quite
like
that
Stephen
should
know
that
;
Maggie
need
not
*NL*
have
mentioned
it
.
Perhaps
there
was
some
pride
in
the
confession
,
--
*NL*
the
pride
of
poverty
that
will
not
be
ashamed
of
itself
.
But
if
Maggie
*NL*
had
been
the
queen
of
coquettes
she
could
hardly
have
invented
a
means
*NL*
of
giving
greater
piquancy
to
her
beauty
in
Stephen
's
eyes
;
I
am
not
*NL*
sure
that
the
quiet
admission
of
plain
sewing
and
poverty
would
have
*NL*
done
alone
,
but
assisted
by
the
beauty
,
they
made
Maggie
more
unlike
*NL*
other
women
even
than
she
had
seemed
at
first
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
can
knit
,
Lucy
,
''
Maggie
went
on
,
``
if
that
will
be
of
any
use
*NL*
for
your
bazaar
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
,
of
infinite
use
.
I
shall
set
you
to
work
with
scarlet
wool
*NL*
to-morrow
.
But
your
sister
is
the
most
enviable
person
,
''
continued
*NL*
Lucy
,
turning
to
Stephen
,
``
to
have
the
talent
of
modelling
.
She
is
*NL*
doing
a
wonderful
bust
of
Dr.
Kenn
entirely
from
memory
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
if
she
can
remember
to
put
the
eyes
very
near
together
,
and
the
*NL*
corners
of
the
mouth
very
far
apart
,
the
likeness
can
hardly
fail
to
*NL*
be
striking
in
St.
Ogg

.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
that
is
very
wicked
of
you
,
''
said
Lucy
,
looking
rather
hurt
.
``
I
*NL*
did
n't
think
you
would
speak
disrespectfully
of
Dr.
Kenn

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
anything
disrespectful
of
Dr.
Kenn
?
Heaven
forbid
!
But
I
am
not
*NL*
bound
to
respect
a
libellous
bust
of
him
.
I
think
Kenn
one
of
the
*NL*
finest
fellows
in
the
world
.
I
do
n't
care
much
about
the
tall
*NL*
candlesticks
he
has
put
on
the
communion-table
,
and
I
should
n't
like
*NL*
to
spoil
my
temper
by
getting
up
to
early
prayers
every
morning
.
But
*NL*
he
's
the
only
man
I
ever
knew
personally
who
seems
to
me
to
have
*NL*
anything
of
the
real
apostle
in
him
,
--
a
man
who
has
eight
hundred
*NL*
a-year
and
is
contented
with
deal
furniture
and
boiled
beef
because
he
*NL*
gives
away
two-thirds
of
his
income
.
That
was
a
very
fine
thing
of
*NL*
him
,
--
taking
into
his
house
that
poor
lad
Grattan
,
who
shot
his
mother
*NL*
by
accident
.
He
sacrifices
more
time
than
a
less
busy
man
could
spare
,
*NL*
to
save
the
poor
fellow
from
getting
into
a
morbid
state
of
mind
about
*NL*
it
.
He
takes
the
lad
out
with
him
constantly
,
I
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
beautiful
,
''
said
Maggie
,
who
had
let
her
work
fall
,
and
was
*NL*
listening
with
keen
interest
.
``
I
never
knew
any
one
who
did
such
things
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
one
admires
that
sort
of
action
in
Kenn
all
the
more
,
''
said
*NL*
Stephen
,
``
because
his
manners
in
general
are
rather
cold
and
severe

*NL*
There
's
nothing
sugary
and
maudlin
about
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
think
he
's
a
perfect
character

said
Lucy
,
with
pretty
*NL*
enthusiasm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
there
I
ca
n't
agree
with
you

said
Stephen
,
shaking
his
head
*NL*
with
sarcastic
gravity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
what
fault
can
you
point
out
in
him

*NL*
*NL*
``
He

an
Anglican

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
those
are
the
right
views

I
think

''
said
Lucy
,
gravely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
settles
the
question
in
the
abstract
,
''
said
Stephen
,
``
but
not
*NL*
from
a
parliamentary
point
of
view

He
has
set
the
Dissenters

by
the
ears
;
and
a
rising
senator
like
myself
,
of
whose
*NL*
services
the
country
is
very
much
in
need
,
will
find
it
inconvenient

when
he
puts
up
for
the
honor
of
representing
St.
Ogg
's
in
*NL*
Parliament
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
really
think
of
that
?

said
Lucy
,
her
eyes
brightening
with
a
*NL*
proud
pleasure
that
made
her
neglect
the
argumentative
interests
of
*NL*
Anglicanism
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Decidedly
,
whenever
old
Mr.
Leyburn
's
public
spirit

gout
induce
*NL*
him
to
give
way

father
's
heart
is
set
on
it
;
and
gifts
like
mine
,
*NL*
you
know

--
here
Stephen
drew
himself
up
,
and
rubbed
his
large
white
*NL*
hands
over
his
hair
with
playful
self-admiration
--
``
gifts
like
mine
*NL*
involve
great
responsibilities
.
Do
n't
you
think
so
,
Miss
Tulliver
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Maggie
,
smiling
,
but
not
looking
up
;
``
so
much
fluency
and
*NL*
self-possession
should
not
be
wasted
entirely
on
private
occasions
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
I
see
how
much
penetration
you
have
,
''
said
Stephen
.
``
You
have
*NL*
discovered
already
that
I
am
talkative
and
impudent
.
Now
superficial
*NL*
people
never
discern
that
,
owing
to
my
manner
,
I
suppose
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
does
n't
look
at
me
when
I
talk
of
myself
,
''
he
thought
,
while
his
*NL*
listeners
were
laughing
.
``
I
must
try
other
subjects
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Did
Lucy
intend
to
be
present
at
the
meeting
of
the
Book
Club
next
*NL*
week
?
was
the
next
question
.
Then
followed
the
recommendation
to
*NL*
choose
Southey
's
``
Life
of
Cowper
,
''
unless
she
were
inclined
to
be
*NL*
philosophical
,
and
startle
the
ladies
of
St.
Ogg
's
by
voting
for
one
*NL*
of
the
Bridgewater
Treatises
.
Of
course
Lucy
wished
to
know
what
these
*NL*
alarmingly
learned
books
were
;
and
as
it
is
always
pleasant
to
improve
*NL*
the
minds
of
ladies
by
talking
to
them
at
ease
on
subjects
of
which
*NL*
they
know
nothing
,
Stephen
became
quite
brilliant
in
an
account
of
*NL*
Buckland
's
Treatise
,
which
he
had
just
been
reading
.
He
was
rewarded
*NL*
by
seeing
Maggie
let
her
work
fall
,
and
gradually
get
so
absorbed
in
*NL*
his
wonderful
geological
story
that
she
sat
looking
at
him
,
leaning
*NL*
forward
with
crossed
arms
,
and
with
an
entire
absence
of
*NL*
self-consciousness
,
as
if
he
had
been
the
snuffiest
of
old
professors
,
*NL*
and
she
a
downy-lipped
alumna
.
He
was
so
fascinated
by
the
clear
,
*NL*
large
gaze
that
at
last
he
forgot
to
look
away
from
it
occasionally
*NL*
toward
Lucy
;
but
she
,
sweet
child
,
was
only
rejoicing
that
Stephen
was
*NL*
proving
to
Maggie
how
clever
he
was
,
and
that
they
would
certainly
be
*NL*
good
friends
after
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
bring
you
the
book
,
shall
I
,
Miss
Tulliver
?
''
said
Stephen
,
*NL*
when
he
found
the
stream
of
his
recollections
running
rather
shallow
.
*NL*
``
There
are
many
illustrations
in
it
that
you
will
like
to
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
thank
you
,
''
said
Maggie
,
blushing
with
returning
*NL*
self-consciousness
at
this
direct
address
,
and
taking
up
her
work
*NL*
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
''
Lucy
interposed
.
``
I
must
forbid
your
plunging
Maggie
in
*NL*
books
.
I
shall
never
get
her
away
from
them
;
and
I
want
her
to
have
*NL*
delicious
do-nothing
days
,
filled
with
boating
and
chatting
and
riding
*NL*
and
driving
;
that
is
the
holiday
she
needs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Apropos
!
''
said
Stephen
,
looking
at
his
watch
.
``
Shall
we
go
out
for
a
*NL*
row
on
the
river
now
?
The
tide
will
suit
for
us
to
the
Tofton
way
,
and
*NL*
we
can
walk
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
a
delightful
proposition
to
Maggie
,
for
it
was
years
since
*NL*
she
had
been
on
the
river
.
When
she
was
gone
to
put
on
her
bonnet
,
*NL*
Lucy
lingered
to
give
an
order
to
the
servant
,
and
took
the
*NL*
opportunity
of
telling
Stephen
that
Maggie
had
no
objection
to
seeing
*NL*
Philip
,
so
that
it
was
a
pity
she
had
sent
that
note
the
day
before
*NL*
yesterday
.
But
she
would
write
another
to-morrow
and
invite
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
call
and
beat
him
up
to-morrow
,
''
said
Stephen
,
``
and
bring
him
*NL*
with
me
in
the
evening
,
shall
I
?
My
sisters
will
want
to
call
on
you
*NL*
when
I
tell
them
your
cousin
is
with
you
.
I
must
leave
the
field
clear
*NL*
for
them
in
the
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
,
pray
bring
him
,
''
said
Lucy
.
``
And
you
_
will
_
like
Maggie
,
*NL*
sha
'n'
t
you
?
''
she
added
,
in
a
beseeching
tone
.
``
Is
n't
she
a
dear
,
*NL*
noble-looking
creature
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Too
tall
,
''
said
Stephen
,
smiling
down
upon
her
,
``
and
a
little
too
*NL*
fiery
.
She
is
not
my
type
of
woman
,
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gentlemen
,
you
are
aware
,
are
apt
to
impart
these
imprudent
*NL*
confidences
to
ladies
concerning
their
unfavorable
opinion
of
sister
*NL*
fair
ones
.
That
is
why
so
many
women
have
the
advantage
of
knowing
*NL*
that
they
are
secretly
repulsive
to
men
who
have
self-denyingly
made
*NL*
ardent
love
to
them
.
And
hardly
anything
could
be
more
distinctively
*NL*
characteristic
of
Lucy
than
that
she
both
implicitly
believed
what
*NL*
Stephen
said
,
and
was
determined
that
Maggie
should
not
know
it
.
But
*NL*
you
,
who
have
a
higher
logic
than
the
verbal
to
guide
you
,
have
*NL*
already
foreseen
,
as
the
direct
sequence
to
that
unfavorable
opinion
*NL*
of
Stephen
's
,
that
he
walked
down
to
the
boathouse
calculating
,
by
the
*NL*
aid
of
a
vivid
imagination
,
that
Maggie
must
give
him
her
hand
at
*NL*
least
twice
in
consequence
of
this
pleasant
boating
plan
,
and
that
a
*NL*
gentleman
who
wishes
ladies
to
look
at
him
is
advantageously
situated
*NL*
when
he
is
rowing
them
in
a
boat
.
What
then
?
Had
he
fallen
in
love
*NL*
with
this
surprising
daughter
of
Mrs.
Tulliver
at
first
sight
?
*NL*
Certainly
not
.
Such
passions
are
never
heard
of
in
real
life
.
Besides
,
*NL*
he
was
in
love
already
,
and
half-engaged
to
the
dearest
little
*NL*
creature
in
the
world
;
and
he
was
not
a
man
to
make
a
fool
of
himself
*NL*
in
any
way
.
But
when
one
is
five-and-twenty
,
one
has
not
chalk-stones
*NL*
at
one
's
finger-ends
that
the
touch
of
a
handsome
girl
should
be
*NL*
entirely
indifferent
.
It
was
perfectly
natural
and
safe
to
admire
*NL*
beauty
and
enjoy
looking
at
it
,
--
at
least
under
such
circumstances
as
*NL*
the
present
.
And
there
was
really
something
very
interesting
about
*NL*
this
girl
,
with
her
poverty
and
troubles
;
it
was
gratifying
to
see
the
*NL*
friendship
between
the
two
cousins
.
Generally
,
Stephen
admitted
,
he
*NL*
was
not
fond
of
women
who
had
any
peculiarity
of
character
,
but
here
*NL*
the
peculiarity
seemed
really
of
a
superior
kind
,
and
provided
one
is
*NL*
not
obliged
to
marry
such
women
,
why
,
they
certainly
make
a
variety
in
*NL*
social
intercourse
.
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
did
not
fulfil
Stephen
's
hope
by
looking
at
him
during
the
*NL*
first
quarter
of
an
hour
;
her
eyes
were
too
full
of
the
old
banks
that
*NL*
she
knew
so
well
.
She
felt
lonely
,
cut
off
from
Philip
,
--
the
only
*NL*
person
who
had
ever
seemed
to
love
her
devotedly
,
as
she
had
always
*NL*
longed
to
be
loved
.
But
presently
the
rhythmic
movement
of
the
oars
*NL*
attracted
her
,
and
she
thought
she
should
like
to
learn
how
to
row
.
*NL*
This
roused
her
from
her
reverie
,
and
she
asked
if
she
might
take
an
*NL*
oar
.
It
appeared
that
she
required
much
teaching
,
and
she
became
*NL*
ambitious
.
The
exercise
brought
the
warm
blood
into
her
cheeks
,
and
*NL*
made
her
inclined
to
take
her
lesson
merrily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
not
be
satisfied
until
I
can
manage
both
oars
,
and
row
you
*NL*
and
Lucy
,
''
she
said
,
looking
very
bright
as
she
stepped
out
of
the
*NL*
boat
.
Maggie
,
we
know
,
was
apt
to
forget
the
thing
she
was
doing
,
and
*NL*
she
had
chosen
an
inopportune
moment
for
her
remark
;
her
foot
slipped
,
*NL*
but
happily
Mr.
Stephen
Guest
held
her
hand
,
and
kept
her
up
with
a
*NL*
firm
grasp
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
not
hurt
yourself
at
all
,
I
hope
?
''
he
said
,
bending
to
look
*NL*
in
her
face
with
anxiety
.
It
was
very
charming
to
be
taken
care
of
in
*NL*
that
kind
,
graceful
manner
by
some
one
taller
and
stronger
than
one
's
*NL*
self
.
Maggie
had
never
felt
just
in
the
same
way
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
reached
home
again
,
they
found
uncle
and
aunt
Pullet
seated
*NL*
with
Mrs.
Tulliver
in
the
drawing-room
,
and
Stephen
hurried
away
,
*NL*
asking
leave
to
come
again
in
the
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
pray
bring
with
you
the
volume
of
Purcell
that
you
took
away
,
''
*NL*
said
Lucy
.
``
I
want
Maggie
to
hear
your
best
songs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Aunt
Pullet
,
under
the
certainty
that
Maggie
would
be
invited
to
go
*NL*
out
with
Lucy
,
probably
to
Park
House
,
was
much
shocked
at
the
*NL*
shabbiness
of
her
clothes
,
which
when
witnessed
by
the
higher
society
*NL*
of
St.
Ogg
's
,
would
be
a
discredit
to
the
family
,
that
demanded
a
*NL*
strong
and
prompt
remedy
;
and
the
consultation
as
to
what
would
be
*NL*
most
suitable
to
this
end
from
among
the
superfluities
of
Mrs.
*NL*
Pullet
's
wardrobe
was
one
that
Lucy
as
well
as
Mrs.
Tulliver
entered
*NL*
into
with
some
zeal
.
Maggie
must
really
have
an
evening
dress
as
soon
*NL*
as
possible
,
and
she
was
about
the
same
height
as
aunt
Pullet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
she
's
so
much
broader
across
the
shoulders
than
I
am
,
it
's
very
*NL*
ill-convenient
,
''
said
Mrs.
Pullet
,
``
else
she
might
wear
that
beautiful
*NL*
black
brocade
o
'
mine
without
any
alteration
;
and
her
arms
are
beyond
*NL*
everything
,
''
added
Mrs.
Pullet
,
sorrowfully
,
as
she
lifted
Maggie
's
*NL*
large
round
arm
,
``
She
'd
never
get
my
sleeves
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
never
mind
that
,
aunt
;
send
us
the
dress
,
''
said
Lucy
.
``
I
do
n't
*NL*
mean
Maggie
to
have
long
sleeves
,
and
I
have
abundance
of
black
lace
*NL*
for
trimming
.
Her
arms
will
look
beautiful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Maggie
's
arms
_
are
_
a
pretty
shape
,
''
said
Mrs.
Tulliver
.
``
They
're
*NL*
like
mine
used
to
be
,
only
mine
was
never
brown
;
I
wish
she
'd
had
*NL*
_
our
_
family
skin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nonsense
,
aunty
!
''
said
Lucy
,
patting
her
aunt
Tulliver
's
shoulder
,
*NL*
``
you
do
n't
understand
those
things
.
A
painter
would
think
Maggie
's
*NL*
complexion
beautiful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Maybe
,
my
dear
,
''
said
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
submissively
.
``
You
know
better
*NL*
than
I
do
.
Only
when
I
was
young
a
brown
skin
was
n't
thought
well
on
*NL*
among
respectable
folks
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
uncle
Pullet
,
who
took
intense
interest
in
the
ladies
'
*NL*
conversation
as
he
sucked
his
lozenges
.
``
Though
there
was
a
song
about
*NL*
the
`
Nut-brown
Maid
'
too
;
I
think
she
was
crazy
,
--
crazy
Kate
,
--
but
I
*NL*
ca
n't
justly
remember
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
dear
,
dear
!
''
said
Maggie
,
laughing
,
but
impatient
;
``
I
think
that
*NL*
will
be
the
end
of
_
my
_
brown
skin
,
if
it
is
always
to
be
talked
about
*NL*
so
much

Chapter
III
*NL*
*NL*
Confidential
Moments
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
Maggie
went
up
to
her
bedroom
that
night
,
it
appeared
that
she
*NL*
was
not
at
all
inclined
to
undress
.
She
set
down
her
candle
on
the
*NL*
first
table
that
presented
itself
,
and
began
to
walk
up
and
down
her
*NL*
room
,
which
was
a
large
one
,
with
a
firm
,
regular
,
and
rather
rapid
*NL*
step
,
which
showed
that
the
exercise
was
the
instinctive
vent
of
*NL*
strong
excitement
.
Her
eyes
and
cheeks
had
an
almost
feverish
*NL*
brilliancy
;
her
head
was
thrown
backward
,
and
her
hands
were
clasped
*NL*
with
the
palms
outward
,
and
with
that
tension
of
the
arms
which
is
apt
*NL*
to
accompany
mental
absorption
.
*NL*
*NL*
Had
anything
remarkable
happened
?
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
that
you
are
not
likely
to
consider
in
the
highest
degree
*NL*
unimportant
.
She
had
been
hearing
some
fine
music
sung
by
a
fine
bass
*NL*
voice
,
--
but
then
it
was
sung
in
a
provincial
,
amateur
fashion
,
such
as
*NL*
would
have
left
a
critical
ear
much
to
desire
.
And
she
was
conscious
*NL*
of
having
been
looked
at
a
great
deal
,
in
rather
a
furtive
manner
,
*NL*
from
beneath
a
pair
of
well-marked
horizontal
eyebrows
,
with
a
glance
*NL*
that
seemed
somehow
to
have
caught
the
vibratory
influence
of
the
*NL*
voice
.
Such
things
could
have
had
no
perceptible
effect
on
a
*NL*
thoroughly
well-educated
young
lady
,
with
a
perfectly
balanced
mind
,
*NL*
who
had
had
all
the
advantages
of
fortune
,
training
,
and
refined
*NL*
society
.
But
if
Maggie
had
been
that
young
lady
,
you
would
probably
*NL*
have
known
nothing
about
her
:
her
life
would
have
had
so
few
*NL*
vicissitudes
that
it
could
hardly
have
been
written
;
for
the
happiest
*NL*
women
,
like
the
happiest
nations
,
have
no
history
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
poor
Maggie
's
highly-strung
,
hungry
nature
,
--
just
come
away
from
a
*NL*
third-rate
schoolroom
,
with
all
its
jarring
sounds
and
petty
round
of
*NL*
tasks
,
--
these
apparently
trivial
causes
had
the
effect
of
rousing
and
*NL*
exalting
her
imagination
in
a
way
that
was
mysterious
to
herself
.
It
*NL*
was
not
that
she
thought
distinctly
of
Mr.
Stephen
Guest
,
or
dwelt
on
*NL*
the
indications
that
he
looked
at
her
with
admiration
;
it
was
rather
*NL*
that
she
felt
the
half-remote
presence
of
a
world
of
love
and
beauty
*NL*
and
delight
,
made
up
of
vague
,
mingled
images
from
all
the
poetry
and
*NL*
romance
she
had
ever
read
,
or
had
ever
woven
in
her
dreamy
reveries
.
*NL*
Her
mind
glanced
back
once
or
twice
to
the
time
when
she
had
courted
*NL*
privation
,
when
she
had
thought
all
longing
,
all
impatience
was
*NL*
subdued
;
but
that
condition
seemed
irrecoverably
gone
,
and
she
*NL*
recoiled
from
the
remembrance
of
it
.
No
prayer
,
no
striving
now
,
would
*NL*
bring
back
that
negative
peace
;
the
battle
of
her
life
,
it
seemed
,
was
*NL*
not
to
be
decided
in
that
short
and
easy
way
,
--
by
perfect
renunciation
*NL*
at
the
very
threshold
of
her
youth
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
music
was
vibrating
in
her
still
,
--
Purcell
's
music
,
with
its
wild
*NL*
passion
and
fancy
,
--
and
she
could
not
stay
in
the
recollection
of
that
*NL*
bare
,
lonely
past
.
She
was
in
her
brighter
aerial
world
again
,
when
a
*NL*
little
tap
came
at
the
door
;
of
course
it
was
her
cousin
,
who
entered
*NL*
in
ample
white
dressing-gown
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
Maggie
,
you
naughty
child
,
have
n't
you
begun
to
undress
?
''
said
*NL*
Lucy
,
in
astonishment
.
``
I
promised
not
to
come
and
talk
to
you
,
*NL*
because
I
thought
you
must
be
tired
.
But
here
you
are
,
looking
as
if
*NL*
you
were
ready
to
dress
for
a
ball
.
Come
,
come
,
get
on
your
*NL*
dressing-gown
and
unplait
your
hair
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
_
you
_
are
not
very
forward
,
''
retorted
Maggie
,
hastily
reaching
*NL*
her
own
pink
cotton
gown
,
and
looking
at
Lucy
's
light-brown
hair
*NL*
brushed
back
in
curly
disorder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
have
not
much
to
do
.
I
shall
sit
down
and
talk
to
you
till
I
*NL*
see
you
are
really
on
the
way
to
bed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
Maggie
stood
and
unplaited
her
long
black
hair
over
her
pink
*NL*
drapery
,
Lucy
sat
down
near
the
toilette-table
,
watching
her
with
*NL*
affectionate
eyes
,
and
head
a
little
aside
,
like
a
pretty
spaniel
.
If
*NL*
it
appears
to
you
at
all
incredible
that
young
ladies
should
be
led
on
*NL*
to
talk
confidentially
in
a
situation
of
this
kind
,
I
will
beg
you
to
*NL*
remember
that
human
life
furnishes
many
exceptional
cases
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
really
_
have
_
enjoyed
the
music
to-night
,
have
n't
you
Maggie
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
,
that
is
what
prevented
me
from
feeling
sleepy
.
I
think
I
*NL*
should
have
no
other
mortal
wants
,
if
I
could
always
have
plenty
of
*NL*
music
.
It
seems
to
infuse
strength
into
my
limbs
,
and
ideas
into
my
*NL*
brain
.
Life
seems
to
go
on
without
effort
,
when
I
am
filled
with
*NL*
music
.
At
other
times
one
is
conscious
of
carrying
a
weight
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
Stephen
has
a
splendid
voice
,
has
n't
he
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
perhaps
we
are
neither
of
us
judges
of
that
,
''
said
Maggie
,
*NL*
laughing
,
as
she
seated
herself
and
tossed
her
long
hair
back
.
``
You
*NL*
are
not
impartial
,
and
_
I
_
think
any
barrel-organ
splendid
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
tell
me
what
you
think
of
him
,
now

Tell
me
exactly
;
good
and
bad
*NL*
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
think
you
should
humiliate
him
a
little
.
A
lover
should
not
be
*NL*
so
much
at
ease
,
and
so
self-confident
.
He
ought
to
tremble
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nonsense
,
Maggie
!
As
if
any
one
could
tremble
at
me
!
You
think
he
is
*NL*
conceited

I
see
that

But
you
do
n't
dislike
him
,
do
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dislike
him

No

Am
I
in
the
habit
of
seeing
such
charming
people
,
*NL*
that
I
should
be
very
difficult
to
please
?
Besides

how
could
I
*NL*
dislike
any
one
that
promised
to
make
you
happy

my
dear
thing

*NL*
Maggie
pinched
Lucy
's
dimpled
chin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
shall
have
more
music
to-morrow
evening
,
''
said
Lucy
,
looking
happy
*NL*
already
,
``
for
Stephen
will
bring
Philip
Wakem
with
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Lucy
,
I
ca
n't
see
him

''
said
Maggie
,
turning
pale
.
``
At
least
,
I
*NL*
could
not
see
him
without
Tom
's
leave
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
Tom
such
a
tyrant
as
that
?

said
Lucy
,
surprised
.
``
I
'll
take
the
*NL*
responsibility
,
then
,

tell
him
it
was
my
fault

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
dear
,
''
said
Maggie
,
falteringly
,
``
I
promised
Tom
very
solemnly
,
*NL*
before
my
father
's
death
,

I
promised
him
I
would
not
speak
to
Philip
*NL*
without
his
knowledge
and
consent
.
And
I
have
a
great
dread
of
opening
*NL*
the
subject
with
Tom
,
--
of
getting
into
a
quarrel
with
him
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
never
heard
of
anything
so
strange

unreasonable

What
harm

can
poor
Philip
have
done
?
May
I
speak
to
Tom
about
it
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no

pray
do
n't

said
Maggie
.
``
I
'll
go
to
him
myself
*NL*
to-morrow
,
and
tell
him
that
you
wish
Philip
to

I
've
thought
*NL*
before
of
asking
him
to
absolve
me
from
my
promise
,
but
I
've
not
had
*NL*
the
courage

determine
on
it

''
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
both
silent
for
some
moments
,
and
then
Lucy
said
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Maggie
,
you
have
secrets
from
me
,
and
I
have
none
from
you

*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
looked
meditatively
away
from
Lucy
.
Then
she
turned
to
her
and
*NL*
said
,
``
I
_
should
_
like
to
tell
you
about
Philip

But
,
Lucy

you

The
narrative
lasted
long
,
for
Maggie
had
never
before
known
the
*NL*
relief
of
such
an
outpouring
;
she
had
never
before
told
Lucy
anything
*NL*
of
her
inmost
life
;
and
the
sweet
face
bent
toward
her
with
*NL*
sympathetic
interest
,
and
the
little
hand
pressing
hers
,
encouraged
*NL*
her
to
speak
on
.
On
two
points
only
she
was
not
expansive
.
She
did
not
*NL*
betray
fully
what
still
rankled
in
her
mind
as
Tom
's
great
*NL*
offence
,
--
the
insults
he
had
heaped
on
Philip
.
Angry
as
the
*NL*
remembrance
still
made
her
,
she
could
not
bear
that
any
one
else
*NL*
should
know
it
at
all
,
both
for
Tom
's
sake
and
Philip
's
.
And
she
could
*NL*
not
bear
to
tell
Lucy
of
the
last
scene
between
her
father
and
Wakem
,
*NL*
though
it
was
this
scene
which
she
had
ever
since
felt
to
be
a
new
*NL*
barrier
between
herself
and
Philip
.
She
merely
said
,
she
saw
now
that
*NL*
Tom
was
,
on
the
whole
,
right
in
regarding
any
prospect
of
love
and
*NL*
marriage
between
her
and
Philip
as
put
out
of
the
question
by
the
*NL*
relation
of
the
two
families
.
Of
course
Philip
's
father
would
never
*NL*
consent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
Lucy
,
you
have
had
my
story
,
''
said
Maggie
,
smiling
,
with
the
*NL*
tears
in
her
eyes
.
``
You
see
I
am
like
Sir
Andrew
Aguecheek
.
_
I
_
was
*NL*
adored
once
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
now
I
see
how
it
is
you
know
Shakespeare
and
everything
,
and
have
*NL*
learned
so
much
since
you
left
school
;
which
always
seemed
to
me
*NL*
witchcraft
before
,
--
part
of
your
general
uncanniness
,
''
said
Lucy
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
mused
a
little
with
her
eyes
downward
,
and
then
added
,
looking
at
*NL*
Maggie
,
``
It
is
very
beautiful
that
you
should
love
Philip
;
I
never
*NL*
thought
such
a
happiness
would
befall
him
.
And
in
my
opinion
,
you
*NL*
ought
not
to
give
him
up
.
There
are
obstacles
now
;
but
they
may
be
*NL*
done
away
with
in
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
shook
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
''
persisted
Lucy
;
``
I
ca
n't
help
being
hopeful
about
it
.
*NL*
There
is
something
romantic
in
it
,
--
out
of
the
common
way
,
--
just
what
*NL*
everything
that
happens
to
you
ought
to
be
.
And
Philip
will
adore
you
*NL*
like
a
husband
in
a
fairy
tale
.
Oh
,
I
shall
puzzle
my
small
brain
to
*NL*
contrive
some
plot
that
will
bring
everybody
into
the
right
mind
,
so
*NL*
that
you
may
marry
Philip
when
I
marry
--
somebody
else
.
Would
n't
that
*NL*
be
a
pretty
ending
to
all
my
poor
,
poor
Maggie
's
troubles
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
tried
to
smile
,
but
shivered
,
as
if
she
felt
a
sudden
chill
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
dear
,
you
are
cold
,
''
said
Lucy
.
``
You
must
go
to
bed
;
and
so
must
*NL*
I.
I
dare
not
think
what
time
it
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
kissed
each
other
,
and
Lucy
went
away
,
possessed
of
a
confidence
*NL*
which
had
a
strong
influence
over
her
subsequent
impressions
.
Maggie
*NL*
had
been
thoroughly
sincere
;
her
nature
had
never
found
it
easy
to
be
*NL*
otherwise
.
But
confidences
are
sometimes
blinding
,
even
when
they
are
*NL*
sincere
.

Brother

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
was
obliged
to
go
to
Tom
's
lodgings
in
the
middle
of
the
day
,
*NL*
when
he
would
be
coming
in
to
dinner
,
else
she
would
not
have
found
*NL*
him
at
home
.
He
was
not
lodging
with
entire
strangers
.
Our
friend
Bob
*NL*
Jakin
had
,
with
Mumps
's
tacit
consent
,
taken
not
only
a
wife
about
*NL*
eight
months
ago
,
but
also
one
of
those
queer
old
houses
,
pierced
with
*NL*
surprising
passages
,
by
the
water-side
,
where
,
as
he
observed
,
his
*NL*
wife
and
mother
could
keep
themselves
out
of
mischief
by
letting
out
*NL*
two
``
pleasure-boats
,
''
in
which
he
had
invested
some
of
his
savings
,
*NL*
and
by
taking
in
a
lodger
for
the
parlor
and
spare
bedroom
.
Under
*NL*
these
circumstances
,
what
could
be
better
for
the
interests
of
all
*NL*
parties
,
sanitary
considerations
apart
,
than
that
the
lodger
should
be
*NL*
Mr.
Tom
?
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
Bob
's
wife
who
opened
the
door
to
Maggie
.
She
was
a
tiny
woman
,
*NL*
with
the
general
physiognomy
of
a
Dutch
doll
,
looking
,
in
comparison
*NL*
with
Bob
's
mother
,
who
filled
up
the
passage
in
the
rear
,
very
much
*NL*
like
one
of
those
human
figures
which
the
artist
finds
conveniently
*NL*
standing
near
a
colossal
statue
to
show
the
proportions
.
The
tiny
*NL*
woman
curtsied
and
looked
up
at
Maggie
with
some
awe
as
soon
as
she
*NL*
had
opened
the
door
;
but
the
words
,
``
Is
my
brother
at
home
?
''
which
*NL*
Maggie
uttered
smilingly
,
made
her
turn
round
with
sudden
excitement
,
*NL*
and
say
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
,
mother
,
mother
--
tell
Bob
!
--
it
's
Miss
Maggie
!
Come
in
,
Miss
,
for
*NL*
goodness
do
,
''
she
went
on
,
opening
a
side
door
,
and
endeavoring
to
*NL*
flatten
her
person
against
the
wall
to
make
the
utmost
space
for
the
*NL*
visitor
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sad
recollections
crowded
on
Maggie
as
she
entered
the
small
parlor
,
*NL*
which
was
now
all
that
poor
Tom
had
to
call
by
the
name
of
*NL*
``
home
,
''
--
that
name
which
had
once
,
so
many
years
ago
,
meant
for
both
*NL*
of
them
the
same
sum
of
dear
familiar
objects
.
But
everything
was
not
*NL*
strange
to
her
in
this
new
room
;
the
first
thing
her
eyes
dwelt
on
was
*NL*
the
large
old
Bible
,
and
the
sight
was
not
likely
to
disperse
the
old
*NL*
memories
.
She
stood
without
speaking
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
please
to
take
the
privilege
o
'
sitting
down
,
Miss
,
''
said
Mrs.
*NL*
Jakin
,
rubbing
her
apron
over
a
perfectly
clean
chair
,
and
then
*NL*
lifting
up
the
corner
of
that
garment
and
holding
it
to
her
face
with
*NL*
an
air
of
embarrassment
,
as
she
looked
wonderingly
at
Maggie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bob
is
at
home
,
then
?
''
said
Maggie
,
recovering
herself
,
and
smiling
*NL*
at
the
bashful
Dutch
doll
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Miss
;
but
I
think
he
must
be
washing
and
dressing
himself
;
I
'll
*NL*
go
and
see
,
''
said
Mrs.
Jakin
,
disappearing
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
presently
came
back
walking
with
new
courage
a
little
way
*NL*
behind
her
husband
,
who
showed
the
brilliancy
of
his
blue
eyes
and
*NL*
regular
white
teeth
in
the
doorway
,
bowing
respectfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
do
,
Bob
?
''
said
Maggie
,
coming
forward
and
putting
out
her
*NL*
hand
to
him
;
``
I
always
meant
to
pay
your
wife
a
visit
,
and
I
shall
*NL*
come
another
day
on
purpose
for
that
,
if
she
will
let
me
.
But
I
was
*NL*
obliged
to
come
to-day
to
speak
to
my
brother
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
He
'll
be
in

that

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Bob
,
I
'm
sure
he
'll
be
indebted
to
you

whatever
he

said
so
himself
only
the
other
night

was
talking

*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh

it

But
I
think
the
more
o
n't
when
*NL*
he
says
a
thing
,
because
his
tongue
does
n't
overshoot
him

*NL*
does

here
Bob
turned
to
his
*NL*
wife
,
--
``
Is
n't
it
all
come
true
as
I
said
?
Though
there
is

*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Bob
's
small
nose
seemed
to
be
following
the
example
of
her
eyes
*NL*
in
turning
up
reverentially
toward
Maggie
,
but
she
was
able
now
to
*NL*
smile
and
curtsey
,
and
say
,
``

*NL*

``

looking

silly

But
about
Mr.

said
Bob

speaking

lower
and
looking
serious
,
``
he

as
close

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
thinks
so
much
about
business
,
''
said
Maggie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
''
said
Bob
,
speaking
lower
;
``
but
do
you
think
it
's
nothin

else

Miss

He

close

Mr.

I

an
'
I
*NL*
thought
tow
`
rt
last
Christmas
as
I
'd
found
out
a
soft
place
in
him

It
*NL*
was
about
a
little
black
spaniel
--
a
rare
bit
o
'
breed
--
as
he
made
a
*NL*
fuss
to
get
.
But
since
then
summat
's
come
over
him
,
as
he
's
set
his
*NL*
teeth
again
'
things
more
nor
iver
,
for
all
he
's
had
such
good
luck
.
*NL*
An
'
I
wanted
to
tell
_
you
_
,
Miss
,
'cause
I
thought
you
might
work
it
*NL*
out
of
him
a
bit
,
now
you
're
come
.
He
's
a
deal
too
lonely
,
and
does
n't
*NL*
go
into
company
enough
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
afraid
I
have
very
little
power
over
him
,
Bob
,
''
said
Maggie
,
a
*NL*
good
deal
moved
by
Bob
's
suggestion
.
It
was
a
totally
new
idea
to
her
*NL*
mind
that
Tom
could
have
his
love
troubles
.
Poor
fellow
!
--
and
in
love
*NL*
with
Lucy
too
!
But
it
was
perhaps
a
mere
fancy
of
Bob
's
too
officious
*NL*
brain
.
The
present
of
the
dog
meant
nothing
more
than
cousinship
and
*NL*
gratitude
.
But
Bob
had
already
said
,
``
Here
's
Mr.
Tom
,
''
and
the
outer
*NL*
door
was
opening
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
no
time
to
spare
,
Tom
,
''
said
Maggie
,
as
soon
as
Bob
left
the
*NL*
room
.
``
I
must
tell
you
at
once
what
I
came
about
,
else
I
shall
be
*NL*
hindering
you
from
taking
your
dinner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
stood
with
his
back
against
the
chimney-piece
,
and
Maggie
was
*NL*
seated
opposite
the
light
.
He
noticed
that
she
was
tremulous
,
and
he
*NL*
had
a
presentiment
of
the
subject
she
was
going
to
speak
about
.
The
*NL*
presentiment
made
his
voice
colder
and
harder
as
he
said
,
``
What
is
*NL*
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
tone
roused
a
spirit
of
resistance
in
Maggie
,
and
she
put
her
*NL*
request
in
quite
a
different
form
from
the
one
she
had
predetermined
*NL*
on
.
She
rose
from
her
seat
,
and
looking
straight
at
Tom
,
said
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
you
to
absolve
me
from
my
promise
about
Philip
Wakem

Or
*NL*
rather
,
I
promised
you
not
to
see
him
without
telling
you

I
am
come
*NL*
to
tell
you
that
I
wish
to
see
him

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
''
said
Tom
,
still
more
coldly
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Maggie
had
hardly
finished
speaking
in
that
chill
,
defiant
manner
,
*NL*
before
she
repented
,
and
felt
the
dread
of
alienation
from
her
*NL*
brother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
for
myself
,
dear
Tom
.
Do
n't
be
angry

I
should
n't
have
asked
it

only
that
Philip
,
you
know
,
is
a
friend
of
Lucy
's
and
she
wishes
him
*NL*
to
come
,
has
invited
him
to
come
this
evening
;
and
I
told
her
I
*NL*
could
n't
see
him
without
telling
you
.
I
shall
only
see
him
in
the
*NL*
presence
of
other
people
.
There
will
never
be
anything
secret
between
*NL*
us
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
looked
away
from
Maggie
,
knitting
his
brow
more
strongly
for
a
*NL*
little
while
.
Then
he
turned
to
her
and
said
,
slowly
and
*NL*
emphatically
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
what
is
my
feeling
on
that
subject
,
Maggie
.
There
is
no
need
*NL*
for
my
repeating
anything
I
said
a
year
ago
.
While
my
father
was
*NL*
living
,
I
felt
bound
to
use
the
utmost
power
over
you
,
to
prevent
you
*NL*
from
disgracing
him
as
well
as
yourself
,
and
all
of
us
.
But
now
I
must
*NL*
leave
you
to
your
own
choice
.
You
wish
to
be
independent
;
you
told
me
*NL*
so
after
my
father
's
death
.
My
opinion
is
not
changed
.
If
you
think
of
*NL*
Philip
Wakem
as
a
lover
again
,
you
must
give
up
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
wish
it
,
dear
Tom
,
at
least
as
things
are
;
I
see
that
it
*NL*
would
lead
to
misery
.
But
I
shall
soon
go
away
to
another
situation
,
*NL*
and
I
should
like
to
be
friends
with
him
again
while
I
am
here
.
Lucy
*NL*
wishes
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
severity
of
Tom
's
face
relaxed
a
little
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
n't
mind
your
seeing
him
occasionally
at
my
uncle
's
--
I
do
n't
*NL*
want
you
to
make
a
fuss
on
the
subject
.
But
I
have
no
confidence
in
*NL*
you
,
Maggie
.
You
would
be
led
away
to
do
anything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
a
cruel
word
.
Maggie
's
lip
began
to
tremble
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
will
you
say
that
,
Tom
?
It
is
very
hard
of
you
.
Have
I
not
done
*NL*
and
borne
everything
as
well
as
I
could
?
And
I
kept
my
word
to
*NL*
you
--
when
--
when
--
My
life
has
not
been
a
happy
one
,
any
more
than
*NL*
yours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
obliged
to
be
childish
;
the
tears
would
come
.
When
Maggie
was
*NL*
not
angry
,
she
was
as
dependent
on
kind
or
cold
words
as
a
daisy
on
*NL*
the
sunshine
or
the
cloud
;
the
need
of
being
loved
would
always
subdue
*NL*
her
,
as
,
in
old
days
,
it
subdued
her
in
the
worm-eaten
attic
.
The
*NL*
brother
's
goodness
came
uppermost
at
this
appeal
,
but
it
could
only
*NL*
show
itself
in
Tom
's
fashion
.
He
put
his
hand
gently
on
her
arm
,
and
*NL*
said
,
in
the
tone
of
a
kind
pedagogue
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
listen
to
me
,
Maggie
.
I
'll
tell
you
what
I
mean
.
You
're
always
in
*NL*
extremes
;
you
have
no
judgment
and
self-command
;
and
yet
you
think
you
*NL*
know
best
,
and
will
not
submit
to
be
guided
.
You
know
I
did
n't
wish
*NL*
you
to
take
a
situation
.
My
aunt
Pullet
was
willing
to
give
you
a
good
*NL*
home
,
and
you
might
have
lived
respectably
amongst
your
relations
,
*NL*
until
I
could
have
provided
a
home
for
you
with
my
mother
.
And
that
is
*NL*
what
I
should
like
to
do
.
I
wished
my
sister
to
be
a
lady
,
and
I
*NL*
always
have
taken
care
of
you
,
as
my
father
desired
,
until
you
were
*NL*
well
married
.
But
your
ideas
and
mine
never
accord
,
and
you
will
not
*NL*
give
way
.
Yet
you
might
have
sense
enough
to
see
that
a
brother
,
who
*NL*
goes
out
into
the
world
and
mixes
with
men
,
necessarily
knows
better
*NL*
what
is
right
and
respectable
for
his
sister
than
she
can
know
*NL*
herself
.
You
think
I
am
not
kind
;
but
my
kindness
can
only
be
directed
*NL*
by
what
I
believe
to
be
good
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
know
,
dear
Tom
,
''
said
Maggie
,
still
half-sobbing
,
but
trying
*NL*
to
control
her
tears
.
``
I
know
you
would
do
a
great
deal
for
me
;
I
know
*NL*
how
you
work
,
and
do
n't
spare
yourself
.
I
am
grateful
to
you
.
But
,
*NL*
indeed
,
you
ca
n't
quite
judge
for
me
;
our
natures
are
very
different
.
*NL*
You
do
n't
know
how
differently
things
affect
me
from
what
they
do
*NL*
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
_
do
_
know
;
I
know
it
too
well
.
I
know
how
differently
you
must
*NL*
feel
about
all
that
affects
our
family
,
and
your
own
dignity
as
a
*NL*
young
woman
,
before
you
could
think
of
receiving
secret
addresses
from
*NL*
Philip
Wakem
.
If
it
was
not
disgusting
to
me
in
every
other
way
,
I
*NL*
should
object
to
my
sister
's
name
being
associated
for
a
moment
with
*NL*
that
of
a
young
man
whose
father
must
hate
the
very
thought
of
us
all
,
*NL*
and
would
spurn
you
.
With
any
one
but
you
,
I
should
think
it
quite
*NL*
certain
that
what
you
witnessed
just
before
my
father
's
death
would
*NL*
secure
you
from
ever
thinking
again
of
Philip
Wakem
as
a
lover
.
But
I
*NL*
do
n't
feel
certain
of
it
with
you
;
I
never
feel
certain
about
anything
*NL*
with
_
you
_
.
At
one
time
you
take
pleasure
in
a
sort
of
perverse
*NL*
self-denial
,
and
at
another
you
have
not
resolution
to
resist
a
thing
*NL*
that
you
know
to
be
wrong
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
terrible
cutting
truth
in
Tom
's
words
,
--
that
hard
rind
of
*NL*
truth
which
is
discerned
by
unimaginative
,
unsympathetic
minds
.
Maggie
*NL*
always
writhed
under
this
judgment
of
Tom
's
;
she
rebelled
and
was
*NL*
humiliated
in
the
same
moment
;
it
seemed
as
if
he
held
a
glass
before
*NL*
her
to
show
her
her
own
folly
and
weakness
,
as
if
he
were
a
prophetic
*NL*
voice
predicting
her
future
fallings
;
and
yet
,
all
the
while
,
she
*NL*
judged
him
in
return
;
she
said
inwardly
that
he
was
narrow
and
unjust
,
*NL*
that
he
was
below
feeling
those
mental
needs
which
were
often
the
*NL*
source
of
the
wrong-doing
or
absurdity
that
made
her
life
a
planless
*NL*
riddle
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
answer
directly
;
her
heart
was
too
full
,
and
she
sat
down
,
*NL*
leaning
her
arm
on
the
table
.
It
was
no
use
trying
to
make
Tom
feel
*NL*
that
she
was
near
to
him
.
He
always
repelled
her
.
Her
feeling
under
*NL*
his
words
was
complicated
by
the
allusion
to
the
last
scene
between
*NL*
her
father
and
Wakem
;
and
at
length
that
painful
,
solemn
memory
*NL*
surmounted
the
immediate
grievance
.
No
!
She
did
not
think
of
such
*NL*
things
with
frivolous
indifference
,
and
Tom
must
not
accuse
her
of
*NL*
that
.
She
looked
up
at
him
with
a
grave
,
earnest
gaze
and
said
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
make
you
think
better
of
me
,
Tom
,
by
anything
I
can
say
.
But
*NL*
I
am
not
so
shut
out
from
all
your
feelings
as
you
believe
me
to
be
.
I
*NL*
see
as
well
as
you
do
that
from
our
position
with
regard
to
Philip
's
*NL*
father
--
not
on
other
grounds
--
it
would
be
unreasonable
,
it
would
be
*NL*
wrong
,
for
us
to
entertain
the
idea
of
marriage
;
and
I
have
given
up
*NL*
thinking
of
him
as
a
lover
.
I
am
telling
you
the
truth
,
and
you
have
*NL*
no
right
to
disbelieve
me
;
I
have
kept
my
word
to
you
,
and
you
have
*NL*
never
detected
me
in
a
falsehood
.
I
should
not
only
not
encourage
,
I
*NL*
should
carefully
avoid
,
any
intercourse
with
Philip
on
any
other
*NL*
footing
than
of
quiet
friendship
.
You
may
think
that
I
am
unable
to
*NL*
keep
my
resolutions
;
but
at
least
you
ought
not
to
treat
me
with
hard
*NL*
contempt
on
the
ground
of
faults
that
I
have
not
committed
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Maggie
,
''
said
Tom
,
softening
under
this
appeal
,
``
I
do
n't
want
*NL*
to
overstrain
matters
.
I
think
,
all
things
considered
,
it
will
be
best
*NL*
for
you
to
see
Philip
Wakem
,
if
Lucy
wishes
him
to
come
to
the
house
.
*NL*
I
believe
what
you
say
,
--
at
least
you
believe
it
yourself
,
I
know
;
I
*NL*
can
only
warn
you
.
I
wish
to
be
as
good
a
brother
to
you
as
you
will
*NL*
let
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
little
tremor
in
Tom
's
voice
as
he
uttered
the
last
words
,
*NL*
and
Maggie
's
ready
affection
came
back
with
as
sudden
a
glow
as
when
*NL*
they
were
children
,
and
bit
their
cake
together
as
a
sacrament
of
*NL*
conciliation
.
She
rose
and
laid
her
hand
on
Tom
's
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
Tom
,
I
know
you
mean
to
be

I

great

deal

bear

have
done
a
great
deal

I
should
like
to
be
a
*NL*
comfort

not
to
vex
you

You
do

I

altogether

naughty

now

*NL*
*NL*
Tom
smiled
at
the
eager
face
;
his
smiles
were
very
pleasant
to
see
*NL*
when
they
did
come
,
for
the
gray
eyes
could
be
tender
underneath
the

frown

looking

*NL*
``

Tom
bent
to
kiss
her

then
said
,

making

retreat

Tom
,
with
masculine
philosophy
,
flung
the
bell-rope
to
*NL*
the
farther
end
of
the
room

not
very
far
either

a
touch
of
human

experience
which
I
flatter
myself
will
come
home
to
the
bosoms
of
not

a

substantial

distinguished
men

were
once
at
an
early
stage
*NL*
of
their
rise
in

cherishing
very
large

''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
waited
less
nervously
than
he
had
done
on
a
former
occasion
in
*NL*
this
apartment
,
while
his
uncle
took
out
his
snuff-box
and
gratified
*NL*
each
nostril
with
deliberate
impartiality
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
Tom
,
''
said
Mr.
Deane
at
last
,
throwing
himself
backward
,
*NL*
``
the
world
goes
on
at
a
smarter
pace
now
than
it
did
when
I
was
a
*NL*
young
fellow
.
Why
,
sir
,
forty
years
ago
,
when
I
was
much
such
a
*NL*
strapping
youngster
as
you
,
a
man
expected
to
pull
between
the
shafts
*NL*
the
best
part
of
his
life
,
before
he
got
the
whip
in
his
hand
.
The
*NL*
looms
went
slowish
,
and
fashions
did
n't
alter
quite
so
fast
;
I
'd
a
*NL*
best
suit
that
lasted
me
six
years
.
Everything
was
on
a
lower
scale
,
*NL*
sir
,
--
in
point
of
expenditure
,
I
mean
.
It
's
this
steam
,
you
see
,
that
*NL*
has
made
the
difference
;
it
drives
on
every
wheel
double
pace
,
and
the
*NL*
wheel
of
fortune
along
with
'em
,
as
our
Mr.
Stephen
Guest
said
at
the
*NL*
anniversary
dinner
-LRB-
he
hits
these
things
off
wonderfully
,
considering
*NL*
he
's
seen
nothing
of
business
-RRB-
.
I
do
n't
find
fault
with
the
change
,
as
*NL*
some
people
do
.
Trade
,
sir
,
opens
a
man
's
eyes
;
and
if
the
population
*NL*
is
to
get
thicker
upon
the
ground
,
as
it
's
doing
,
the
world
must
use
*NL*
its
wits
at
inventions
of
one
sort
or
other
.
I
know
I
've
done
my
share
*NL*
as
an
ordinary
man
of
business
.
Somebody
has
said
it
's
a
fine
thing
to
*NL*
make
two
ears
of
corn
grow
where
only
one
grew
before
;
but
,
sir
,
it
's
*NL*
a
fine
thing
,
too
,
to
further
the
exchange
of
commodities
,
and
bring
*NL*
the
grains
of
corn
to
the
mouths
that
are
hungry
.
And
that
's
our
line
*NL*
of
business
;
and
I
consider
it
as
honorable
a
position
as
a
man
can
*NL*
hold
,
to
be
connected
with
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
knew
that
the
affair
his
uncle
had
to
speak
of
was
not
urgent
;
Mr.
*NL*
Deane
was
too
shrewd
and
practical
a
man
to
allow
either
his
*NL*
reminiscences
or
his
snuff
to
impede
the
progress
of
trade
.
Indeed
,
*NL*
for
the
last
month
or
two
,
there
had
been
hints
thrown
out
to
Tom
*NL*
which
enabled
him
to
guess
that
he
was
going
to
hear
some
proposition
*NL*
for
his
own
benefit
.
With
the
beginning
of
the
last
speech
he
had
*NL*
stretched
out
his
legs
,
thrust
his
hands
in
his
pockets
,
and
prepared
*NL*
himself
for
some
introductory
diffuseness
,
tending
to
show
that
Mr.
*NL*
Deane
had
succeeded
by
his
own
merit
,
and
that
what
he
had
to
say
to
*NL*
young
men
in
general
was
,
that
if
they
did
n't
succeed
too
it
was
*NL*
because
of
their
own
demerit
.
He
was
rather
surprised
,
then
,
when
his
*NL*
uncle
put
a
direct
question
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
see
,
--
it
's
going
on
for
seven
years
now
since
you
applied
to
*NL*
me
for
a
situation
,
eh
,
Tom
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
;
I
'm
three-and-twenty
now
,
''
said
Tom
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
it
's
as
well
not
to
say
that
,
though
;
for
you
'd
pass
for
a
good
*NL*
deal
older
,
and
age
tells
well
in
business
.
I
remember
your
coming
*NL*
very
well
;
I
remember
I
saw
there
was
some
pluck
in
you
,
and
that
was
*NL*
what
made
me
give
you
encouragement
.
And
I
'm
happy
to
say
I
was
right
;
*NL*
I
'm
not
often
deceived
.
I
was
naturally
a
little
shy
at
pushing
my
*NL*
nephew
,
but
I
'm
happy
to
say
you
've
done
me
credit
,
sir
;
and
if
I
'd
*NL*
had
a
son
o
'
my
own
,
I
should
n't
have
been
sorry
to
see
him
like
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Deane
tapped
his
box
and
opened
it
again
,
repeating
in
a
tone
of
*NL*
some
feeling
,
``
No
,
I
should
n't
have
been
sorry
to
see
him
like
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
very
glad
I
've
given
you
satisfaction
,
sir
;
I
've
done
my
best
,
''
*NL*
said
Tom
,
in
his
proud
,
independent
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Tom
,
you
've
given
me
satisfaction
.
I
do
n't
speak
of
your
conduct
*NL*
as
a
son
;
though
that
weighs
with
me
in
my
opinion
of
you
.
But
what
I
*NL*
have
to
do
with
,
as
a
partner
in
our
firm
,
is
the
qualities
you
've
*NL*
shown
as
a
man
o
'
business
.
Ours
is
a
fine
business
,
--
a
splendid
*NL*
concern
,
sir
,
--
and
there
's
no
reason
why
it
should
n't
go
on
growing
;
*NL*
there
's
a
growing
capital
,
and
growing
outlets
for
it
;
but
there
's
*NL*
another
thing
that
's
wanted
for
the
prosperity
of
every
concern
,
large
*NL*
or
small
,
and
that
's
men
to
conduct
it
,
--
men
of
the
right
habits
;
none
*NL*
o
'
your
flashy
fellows
,
but
such
as
are
to
be
depended
on
.
Now
this
is
*NL*
what
Mr.
Guest
and
I
see
clear
enough
.
Three
years
ago
we
took
Gell
*NL*
into
the
concern
;
we
gave
him
a
share
in
the
oil-mill
.
And
why
?
Why
,
*NL*
because
Gell
was
a
fellow
whose
services
were
worth
a
premium
.
So
it
*NL*
will
always
be
,
sir
.
So
it
was
with
me
.
And
though
Gell
is
pretty
near
*NL*
ten
years
older
than
you
,
there
are
other
points
in
your
favor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
was
getting
a
little
nervous
as
Mr.
Deane
went
on
speaking
;
he
was
*NL*
conscious
of
something
he
had
in
his
mind
to
say
,
which
might
not
be
*NL*
agreeable
to
his
uncle
,
simply
because
it
was
a
new
suggestion
rather
*NL*
than
an
acceptance
of
the
proposition
he
foresaw
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
stands
to
reason
,
''
Mr.
Deane
went
on
,
when
he
had
finished
his
new
*NL*
pinch
,
``
that
your
being
my
nephew
weighs
in
your
favor
;
but
I
do
n't
*NL*
deny
that
if
you
'd
been
no
relation
of
mine
at
all
,
your
conduct
in
*NL*
that
affair
of
Pelley
's
bank
would
have
led
Mr.
Guest
and
myself
to
*NL*
make
some
acknowledgment
of
the
service
you
've
been
to
us
;
and
,
backed
*NL*
by
your
general
conduct
and
business
ability
,
it
has
made
us
determine
*NL*
on
giving
you
a
share
in
the
business
,
--
a
share
which
we
shall
be
glad
*NL*
to
increase
as
the
years
go
on
.
We
think
that
'll
be
better
,
on
all
*NL*
grounds
,
than
raising
your
salary
.
It
'll
give
you
more
importance
,
and
*NL*
prepare
you
better
for
taking
some
of
the
anxiety
off
my
shoulders
by
*NL*
and
by
.
I
'm
equal
to
a
good
deal
o
'
work
at
present
,
thank
God
;
but
*NL*
I
'm
getting
older
,
--
there
's
no
denying
that
.
I
told
Mr.
Guest
I
would
*NL*
open
the
subject
to
you
;
and
when
you
come
back
from
this
northern
*NL*
business
,
we
can
go
into
particulars
.
This
is
a
great
stride
for
a
*NL*
young
fellow
of
three-and-twenty
,
but
I
'm
bound
to
say
you
've
deserved
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
very
grateful
to
Mr.
Guest
and
you
,
sir
;
of
course
I
feel
the
*NL*
most
indebted
to
_
you
_
,
who
first
took
me
into
the
business
,
and
have
*NL*
taken
a
good
deal
of
pains
with
me
since
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
spoke
with
a
slight
tremor
,
and
paused
after
he
had
said
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,

said
Mr.
Deane
.
``
I
do
n't
spare
pains
when
I
see
they
'll
be
*NL*
of
any
use

I
gave
myself
some
trouble
with
Gell
,
else
he
would
n't
*NL*
have
been
what
he
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
there
's
one
thing
I
should
like
to
mention
to
you
uncle
.
I
've
*NL*
never
spoken
to
you
of
it
before
.
If
you
remember
,
at
the
time
my
*NL*
father
's
property
was
sold
,
there
was
some
thought
of
your
firm
buying
*NL*
the
Mill
;
I
know
you
thought
it
would
be
a
very
good
investment
,
*NL*
especially
if
steam
were
applied
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
be
sure
,
to
be
sure
.
But
Wakem
outbid
us
;
he
'd
made
up
his
mind
to
*NL*
that
.
He
's
rather
fond
of
carrying
everything
over
other
people
's
*NL*
heads
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
it
's
of
no
use
my
mentioning
it
at
present
,
''
Tom
went
on
,
*NL*
``
but
I
wish
you
to
know
what
I
have
in
my
mind
about
the
Mill
.
I
've
a
*NL*
strong
feeling
about
it
.
It
was
my
father
's
dying
wish
that
I
should
*NL*
try
and
get
it
back
again
whenever
I
could
;
it
was
in
his
family
for
*NL*
five
generations
.
I
promised
my
father
;
and
besides
that
,
I
'm
attached
*NL*
to
the
place
.
I
shall
never
like
any
other
so
well
.
And
if
it
should
*NL*
ever
suit
your
views
to
buy
it
for
the
firm
,
I
should
have
a
better
*NL*
chance
of
fulfilling
my
father
's
wish
.
I
should
n't
have
liked
to
*NL*
mention
the
thing
to
you
,
only
you
've
been
kind
enough
to
say
my
*NL*
services
have
been
of
some
value
.
And
I
'd
give
up
a
much
greater
*NL*
chance
in
life
for
the
sake
of
having
the
Mill
again
,
--
I
mean
having
*NL*
it
in
my
own
hands
,
and
gradually
working
off
the
price
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Deane
had
listened
attentively
,
and
now
looked
thoughtful
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
,
I
see
,
''
he
said
,
after
a
while
;
``
the
thing
would
be
possible
*NL*
if
there
were
any
chance
of
Wakem
's
parting
with
the
property
.
But
*NL*
that
I
_
do
n't
_
see
.
He
's
put
that
young
Jetsome
in
the
place
;
and
he
*NL*
had
his
reasons
when
he
bought
it
,
I
'll
be
bound
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
a
loose
fish
,
that
young
Jetsome

said
Tom
.
``
He
's
taking
to
*NL*
drinking
,
and
they
say
he
's
letting
the
business
go
down

Luke
told
me
*NL*
about
it
,
--
our
old
miller
.
He
says
he
sha
'n'
t
stay
unless
there
's
an
*NL*
alteration

I
was
thinking
,
if
things
went
on
that
way
,
Wakem
might
be
*NL*
more
willing
to
part
with
the
Mill

Luke
says
he
's
getting
very
sour
*NL*
about
the
way
things
are
going
on

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
'll
turn
it
over

Tom

I
must
inquire
into
the
matter

and
go
*NL*
into
it
with
Mr.
Guest

But
,
you
see
,
it
's
rather
striking
out
a
new
*NL*
branch
,
and
putting
you
to
that
,
instead
of
keeping
you
where
you
are
,

was
what
we

wanted

I
should
be
able
to
manage
more
than
the
Mill

things
were
once

set
properly
going

I
want
to
have
plenty
of
work

nothing

There
was
something
rather
sad
in
that
speech
from

three-and-twenty

in

Illustrating

*NL*
*NL*
It
is
evident
to
you
now
that
Maggie
had
arrived
at
a
moment
in
her
*NL*
life
which
must
be
considered
by
all
prudent
persons
as
a
great
*NL*
opportunity
for
a
young
woman
.
Launched
into
the
higher
society
of
St.
*NL*
Ogg
's
,
with
a
striking
person
,
which
had
the
advantage
of
being
quite
*NL*
unfamiliar
to
the
majority
of
beholders
,
and
with
such
moderate
*NL*
assistance
of
costume
as
you
have
seen
foreshadowed
in
Lucy
's
anxious
*NL*
colloquy
with
aunt
Pullet
,
Maggie
was
certainly
at
a
new
*NL*
starting-point
in
life
.
At
Lucy
's
first
evening
party
,
young
Torry
*NL*
fatigued
his
facial
muscles
more
than
usual
in
order
that
``
the
*NL*
dark-eyed
girl
there
in
the
corner
''
might
see
him
in
all
the
*NL*
additional
style
conferred
by
his
eyeglass
;
and
several
young
ladies
*NL*
went
home
intending
to
have
short
sleeves
with
black
lace
,
and
to
*NL*
plait
their
hair
in
a
broad
coronet
at
the
back
of
their
head
,
--
``
That
*NL*
cousin
of
Miss
Deane
's
looked
so
very
well
.
''
In
fact
,
poor
Maggie
,
*NL*
with
all
her
inward
consciousness
of
a
painful
past
and
her
*NL*
presentiment
of
a
troublous
future
,
was
on
the
way
to
become
an
object
*NL*
of
some
envy
,
--
a
topic
of
discussion
in
the
newly
established
*NL*
billiard-room
,
and
between
fair
friends
who
had
no
secrets
from
each
*NL*
other
on
the
subject
of
trimmings
.
The
Miss
Guests
,
who
associated
*NL*
chiefly
on
terms
of
condescension
with
the
families
of
St.
Ogg
's
,
and
*NL*
were
the
glass
of
fashion
there
,
took
some
exception
to
Maggie
's
*NL*
manners
.
She
had
a
way
of
not
assenting
at
once
to
the
observations
*NL*
current
in
good
society
,
and
of
saying
that
she
did
n't
know
whether
*NL*
those
observations
were
true
or
not
,
which
gave
her
an
air
of
*NL*
_
gaucherie
_
,
and
impeded
the
even
flow
of
conversation
;
but
it
is
a
*NL*
fact
capable
of
an
amiable
interpretation
that
ladies
are
not
the
*NL*
worst
disposed
toward
a
new
acquaintance
of
their
own
sex
because
she
*NL*
has
points
of
inferiority
.
And
Maggie
was
so
entirely
without
those
*NL*
pretty
airs
of
coquetry
which
have
the
traditional
reputation
of
*NL*
driving
gentlemen
to
despair
that
she
won
some
feminine
pity
for
being
*NL*
so
ineffective
in
spite
of
her
beauty
.
She
had
not
had
many
*NL*
advantages
,
poor
thing
!
and
it
must
be
admitted
there
was
no
*NL*
pretension
about
her
;
her
abruptness
and
unevenness
of
manner
were
*NL*
plainly
the
result
of
her
secluded
and
lowly
circumstances
.
It
was
*NL*
only
a
wonder
that
there
was
no
tinge
of
vulgarity
about
her
,
*NL*
considering
what
the
rest
of
poor
Lucy
's
relations
were
--
an
allusion
*NL*
which
always
made
the
Miss
Guests
shudder
a
little
.
It
was
not
*NL*
agreeable
to
think
of
any
connection
by
marriage
with
such
people
as
*NL*
the
Gleggs
and
the
Pullets
;
but
it
was
of
no
use
to
contradict
Stephen
*NL*
when
once
he
had
set
his
mind
on
anything
,
and
certainly
there
was
no
*NL*
possible
objection
to
Lucy
in
herself
,
--
no
one
could
help
liking
her
.
*NL*
She
would
naturally
desire
that
the
Miss
Guests
should
behave
kindly
*NL*
to
this
cousin
of
whom
she
was
so
fond
,
and
Stephen
would
make
a
great
*NL*
fuss
if
they
were
deficient
in
civility
.
Under
these
circumstances
the
*NL*
invitations
to
Park
House
were
not
wanting
;
and
elsewhere
,
also
,
Miss
*NL*
Deane
was
too
popular
and
too
distinguished
a
member
of
society
in
St.
*NL*
Ogg
's
for
any
attention
toward
her
to
be
neglected
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
Maggie
was
introduced
for
the
first
time
to
the
young
lady
's
*NL*
life
,
and
knew
what
it
was
to
get
up
in
the
morning
without
any
*NL*
imperative
reason
for
doing
one
thing
more
than
another
.
This
new
*NL*
sense
of
leisure
and
unchecked
enjoyment
amidst
the
soft-breathing
*NL*
airs
and
garden-scents
of
advancing
spring
--
amidst
the
new
abundance
*NL*
of
music
,
and
lingering
strolls
in
the
sunshine
,
and
the
delicious
*NL*
dreaminess
of
gliding
on
the
river
--
could
hardly
be
without
some
*NL*
intoxicating
effect
on
her
,
after
her
years
of
privation
;
and
even
in
*NL*
the
first
week
Maggie
began
to
be
less
haunted
by
her
sad
memories
and
*NL*
anticipations
.
Life
was
certainly
very
pleasant
just
now
;
it
was
*NL*
becoming
very
pleasant
to
dress
in
the
evening
,
and
to
feel
that
she
*NL*
was
one
of
the
beautiful
things
of
this
spring-time
.
And
there
were
*NL*
admiring
eyes
always
awaiting
her
now
;
she
was
no
longer
an
unheeded
*NL*
person
,
liable
to
be
chid
,
from
whom
attention
was
continually
*NL*
claimed
,
and
on
whom
no
one
felt
bound
to
confer
any
.
It
was
pleasant
,
*NL*
too
,
when
Stephen
and
Lucy
were
gone
out
riding
,
to
sit
down
at
the
*NL*
piano
alone
,
and
find
that
the
old
fitness
between
her
fingers
and
the
*NL*
keys
remained
,
and
revived
,
like
a
sympathetic
kinship
not
to
be
worn
*NL*
out
by
separation
;
to
get
the
tunes
she
had
heard
the
evening
before
,
*NL*
and
repeat
them
again
and
again
until
she
had
found
out
a
way
of
*NL*
producing
them
so
as
to
make
them
a
more
pregnant
,
passionate
language
*NL*
to
her
.
The
mere
concord
of
octaves
was
a
delight
to
Maggie
,
and
she
*NL*
would
often
take
up
a
book
of
studies
rather
than
any
melody
,
that
she
*NL*
might
taste
more
keenly
by
abstraction
the
more
primitive
sensation
of
*NL*
intervals
.
Not
that
her
enjoyment
of
music
was
of
the
kind
that
*NL*
indicates
a
great
specific
talent
;
it
was
rather
that
her
sensibility
*NL*
to
the
supreme
excitement
of
music
was
only
one
form
of
that
*NL*
passionate
sensibility
which
belonged
to
her
whole
nature
,
and
made
*NL*
her
faults
and
virtues
all
merge
in
each
other
;
made
her
affections
*NL*
sometimes
an
impatient
demand
,
but
also
prevented
her
vanity
from
*NL*
taking
the
form
of
mere
feminine
coquetry
and
device
,
and
gave
it
the
*NL*
poetry
of
ambition
.
But
you
have
known
Maggie
a
long
while
,
and
need
*NL*
to
be
told
,
not
her
characteristics
,
but
her
history
,
which
is
a
thing
*NL*
hardly
to
be
predicted
even
from
the
completest
knowledge
of
*NL*
characteristics
.
For
the
tragedy
of
our
lives
is
not
created
entirely
*NL*
from
within
.
``
Character
,
''
says
Novalis
,
in
one
of
his
questionable
*NL*
aphorisms
,
--
``
character
is
destiny
.
''
But
not
the
whole
of
our
destiny
.
*NL*
Hamlet
,
Prince
of
Denmark
,
was
speculative
and
irresolute
,
and
we
have
*NL*
a
great
tragedy
in
consequence
.
But
if
his
father
had
lived
to
a
good
*NL*
old
age
,
and
his
uncle
had
died
an
early
death
,
we
can
conceive
*NL*
Hamlet
's
having
married
Ophelia
,
and
got
through
life
with
a
*NL*
reputation
of
sanity
,
notwithstanding
many
soliloquies
,
and
some
moody
*NL*
sarcasms
toward
the
fair
daughter
of
Polonius
,
to
say
nothing
of
the
*NL*
frankest
incivility
to
his
father-in-law
.
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
's
destiny
,
then
,
is
at
present
hidden
,
and
we
must
wait
for
it
*NL*
to
reveal
itself
like
the
course
of
an
unmapped
river
;
we
only
know
*NL*
that
the
river
is
full
and
rapid
,
and
that
for
all
rivers
there
is
the
*NL*
same
final
home
.
Under
the
charm
of
her
new
pleasures
,
Maggie
herself
*NL*
was
ceasing
to
think
,
with
her
eager
prefiguring
imagination
,
of
her
*NL*
future
lot
;
and
her
anxiety
about
her
first
interview
with
Philip
was
*NL*
losing
its
predominance
;
perhaps
,
unconsciously
to
herself
,
she
was
*NL*
not
sorry
that
the
interview
had
been
deferred
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
Philip
had
not
come
the
evening
he
was
expected
,
and
Mr.
Stephen
*NL*
Guest
brought
word
that
he
was
gone
to
the
coast
,
--
probably
,
he
*NL*
thought
,
on
a
sketching
expedition
;
but
it
was
not
certain
when
he
*NL*
would
return
.
It
was
just
like
Philip
,
to
go
off
in
that
way
without
*NL*
telling
any
one
.
It
was
not
until
the
twelfth
day
that
he
returned
,
to
*NL*
find
both
Lucy
's
notes
awaiting
him
;
he
had
left
before
he
knew
of
*NL*
Maggie
's
arrival
.
*NL*
*NL*
Perhaps
one
had
need
be
nineteen
again
to
be
quite
convinced
of
the
*NL*
feelings
that
were
crowded
for
Maggie
into
those
twelve
days
;
of
the
*NL*
length
to
which
they
were
stretched
for
her
by
the
novelty
of
her
*NL*
experience
in
them
,
and
the
varying
attitudes
of
her
mind
.
The
early
*NL*
days
of
an
acquaintance
almost
always
have
this
importance
for
us
,
and
*NL*
fill
up
a
larger
space
in
our
memory
than
longer
subsequent
periods
,
*NL*
which
have
been
less
filled
with
discovery
and
new
impressions
.
There
*NL*
were
not
many
hours
in
those
ten
days
in
which
Mr.
Stephen
Guest
was
*NL*
not
seated
by
Lucy
's
side
,
or
standing
near
her
at
the
piano
,
or
*NL*
accompanying
her
on
some
outdoor
excursion
;
his
attentions
were
*NL*
clearly
becoming
more
assiduous
,
and
that
was
what
every
one
had
*NL*
expected
.
Lucy
was
very
happy
,
all
the
happier
because
Stephen
's
*NL*
society
seemed
to
have
become
much
more
interesting
and
amusing
since
*NL*
Maggie
had
been
there
.
Playful
discussions
--
sometimes
serious
*NL*
ones
--
were
going
forward
,
in
which
both
Stephen
and
Maggie
revealed
*NL*
themselves
,
to
the
admiration
of
the
gentle
,
unobtrusive
Lucy
;
and
it
*NL*
more
than
once
crossed
her
mind
what
a
charming
quartet
they
should
*NL*
have
through
life
when
Maggie
married
Philip
.
Is
it
an
inexplicable
*NL*
thing
that
a
girl
should
enjoy
her
lover
's
society
the
more
for
the
*NL*
presence
of
a
third
person
,
and
be
without
the
slightest
spasm
of
*NL*
jealousy
that
the
third
person
had
the
conversation
habitually
*NL*
directed
to
her
?
Not
when
that
girl
is
as
tranquil-hearted
as
Lucy
,
*NL*
thoroughly
possessed
with
a
belief
that
she
knows
the
state
of
her
*NL*
companions
'
affections
,
and
not
prone
to
the
feelings
which
shake
such
*NL*
a
belief
in
the
absence
of
positive
evidence
against
it
.
Besides
,
it
*NL*
was
Lucy
by
whom
Stephen
sat
,
to
whom
he
gave
his
arm
,
to
whom
he
*NL*
appealed
as
the
person
sure
to
agree
with
him
;
and
every
day
there
was
*NL*
the
same
tender
politeness
toward
her
,
the
same
consciousness
of
her
*NL*
wants
and
care
to
supply
them
.
Was
there
really
the
same
?
It
seemed
to
*NL*
Lucy
that
there
was
more
;
and
it
was
no
wonder
that
the
real
*NL*
significance
of
the
change
escaped
her
.
It
was
a
subtle
act
of
*NL*
conscience
in
Stephen
that
even
he
himself
was
not
aware
of
.
His
*NL*
personal
attentions
to
Maggie
were
comparatively
slight
,
and
there
had
*NL*
even
sprung
up
an
apparent
distance
between
them
,
that
prevented
the
*NL*
renewal
of
that
faint
resemblance
to
gallantry
into
which
he
had
*NL*
fallen
the
first
day
in
the
boat
.
If
Stephen
came
in
when
Lucy
was
out
*NL*
of
the
room
,
if
Lucy
left
them
together
,
they
never
spoke
to
each
*NL*
other
;
Stephen
,
perhaps
,
seemed
to
be
examining
books
or
music
,
and
*NL*
Maggie
bent
her
head
assiduously
over
her
work
.
Each
was
oppressively
*NL*
conscious
of
the
other
's
presence
,
even
to
the
finger-ends
.
Yet
each
*NL*
looked
and
longed
for
the
same
thing
to
happen
the
next
day
.
Neither
*NL*
of
them
had
begun
to
reflect
on
the
matter
,
or
silently
to
ask
,
``
To
*NL*
what
does
all
this
tend
?
''
Maggie
only
felt
that
life
was
revealing
*NL*
something
quite
new
to
her
;
and
she
was
absorbed
in
the
direct
,
*NL*
immediate
experience
,
without
any
energy
left
for
taking
account
of
it
*NL*
and
reasoning
about
it
.
Stephen
wilfully
abstained
from
*NL*
self-questioning
,
and
would
not
admit
to
himself
that
he
felt
an
*NL*
influence
which
was
to
have
any
determining
effect
on
his
conduct
.
And
*NL*
when
Lucy
came
into
the
room
again
,
they
were
once
more
unconstrained
;
*NL*
Maggie
could
contradict
Stephen
,
and
laugh
at
him
,
and
he
could
*NL*
recommend
to
her
consideration
the
example
of
that
most
charming
*NL*
heroine
,
Miss
Sophia
Western
,
who
had
a
great
``
respect
for
the
*NL*
understandings
of
men
.
''
Maggie
could
look
at
Stephen
,
which
,
for
some
*NL*
reason
or
other
she
always
avoided
when
they
were
alone
;
and
he
could
*NL*
even
ask
her
to
play
his
accompaniment
for
him
,
since
Lucy
's
fingers
*NL*
were
so
busy
with
that
bazaar-work
,
and
lecture
her
on
hurrying
the
*NL*
tempo
,
which
was
certainly
Maggie
's
weak
point
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
--
it
was
the
day
of
Philip
's
return
--
Lucy
had
formed
a
sudden
*NL*
engagement
to
spend
the
evening
with
Mrs.
Kenn
,
whose
delicate
state
*NL*
of
health
,
threatening
to
become
confirmed
illness
through
an
attack
*NL*
of
bronchitis
,
obliged
her
to
resign
her
functions
at
the
coming
*NL*
bazaar
into
the
hands
of
other
ladies
,
of
whom
she
wished
Lucy
to
be
*NL*
one
.
The
engagement
had
been
formed
in
Stephen
's
presence
,
and
he
had
*NL*
heard
Lucy
promise
to
dine
early
and
call
at
six
o'clock
for
Miss
*NL*
Torry
,
who
brought
Mrs.
Kenn
's
request
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
is
another
of
the
moral
results
of
this
idiotic
bazaar
,
''
Stephen
*NL*
burst
forth
,
as
soon
as
Miss
Torry
had
left
the
room
,
--
``
taking
young
*NL*
ladies
from
the
duties
of
the
domestic
hearth
into
scenes
of
*NL*
dissipation
among
urn-rugs
and
embroidered
reticules
!
I
should
like
to
*NL*
know
what
is
the
proper
function
of
women
,
if
it
is
not
to
make
*NL*
reasons
for
husbands
to
stay
at
home
,
and
still
stronger
reasons
for
*NL*
bachelors
to
go
out
.
If
this
goes
on
much
longer
,
the
bonds
of
society
*NL*
will
be
dissolved
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
it
will
not
go
on
much
longer
,
''
said
Lucy
,
laughing
,
``
for
the
*NL*
bazaar
is
to
take
place
on
Monday
week
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
Heaven
!
''
said
Stephen
.
``
Kenn
himself
said
the
other
day
that
he
*NL*
did
n't
like
this
plan
of
making
vanity
do
the
work
of
charity
;
but
*NL*
just
as
the
British
public
is
not
reasonable
enough
to
bear
direct
*NL*
taxation
,
so
St.
Ogg
's
has
not
got
force
of
motive
enough
to
build
and
*NL*
endow
schools
without
calling
in
the
force
of
folly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
he
say
so
?
''
said
little
Lucy
,
her
hazel
eyes
opening
wide
with
*NL*
anxiety
.
``
I
never
heard
him
say
anything
of
that
kind
;
I
thought
he
*NL*
approved
of
what
we
were
doing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sure
he
approves
_
you
_
,
''
said
Stephen
,
smiling
at
her
*NL*
affectionately
;
``
your
conduct
in
going
out
to-night
looks
vicious
,
I
*NL*
own
,
but
I
know
there
is
benevolence
at
the
bottom
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
think
too
well
of
me
,
''
said
Lucy
,
shaking
her
head
,
with
a
*NL*
pretty
blush
,
and
there
the
subject
ended
.
But
it
was
tacitly
*NL*
understood
that
Stephen
would
not
come
in
the
evening
;
and
on
the
*NL*
strength
of
that
tacit
understanding
he
made
his
morning
visit
the
*NL*
longer
,
not
saying
good-bye
until
after
four
.
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
was
seated
in
the
drawing-room
,
alone
,
shortly
after
dinner
,
*NL*
with
Minny
on
her
lap
,
having
left
her
uncle
to
his
wine
and
his
nap
,
*NL*
and
her
mother
to
the
compromise
between
knitting
and
nodding
,
which
,
*NL*
when
there
was
no
company
,
she
always
carried
on
in
the
dining-room
*NL*
till
tea-time
.
Maggie
was
stooping
to
caress
the
tiny
silken
pet
,
and
*NL*
comforting
him
for
his
mistress
's
absence
,
when
the
sound
of
a
*NL*
footstep
on
the
gravel
made
her
look
up
,
and
she
saw
Mr.
Stephen
Guest
*NL*
walking
up
the
garden
,
as
if
he
had
come
straight
from
the
river
.
It
*NL*
was
very
unusual
to
see
him
so
soon
after
dinner
!
He
often
complained
*NL*
that
their
dinner-hour
was
late
at
Park
House
.
Nevertheless
,
there
he
*NL*
was
,
in
his
black
dress
;
he
had
evidently
been
home
,
and
must
have
*NL*
come
again
by
the
river
.
Maggie
felt
her
cheeks
glowing
and
her
heart
*NL*
beating
;
it
was
natural
she
should
be
nervous
,
for
she
was
not
*NL*
accustomed
to
receive
visitors
alone
.
He
had
seen
her
look
up
through
*NL*
the
open
window
,
and
raised
his
hat
as
he
walked
toward
it
,
to
enter
*NL*
that
way
instead
of
by
the
door
.
He
blushed
too
,
and
certainly
looked
*NL*
as
foolish
as
a
young
man
of
some
wit
and
self-possession
can
be
*NL*
expected
to
look
,
as
he
walked
in
with
a
roll
of
music
in
his
hand
,
*NL*
and
said
,
with
an
air
of
hesitating
improvisation
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
surprised
to
see
me
again
,
Miss
Tulliver
;
I
ought
to
*NL*
apologize
for
coming
upon
you
by
surprise
,
but
I
wanted
to
come
into
*NL*
the
town
,
and
I
got
our
man
to
row
me
;
so
I
thought
I
would
bring
*NL*
these
things
from
the
`
Maid
of
Artois
'
for
your
cousin
;
I
forgot
them
*NL*
this
morning
.
Will
you
give
them
to
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Maggie
,
who
had
risen
confusedly
with
Minny
in
her
arms
,
*NL*
and
now
,
not
quite
knowing
what
else
to
do
,
sat
down
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
laid
down
his
hat
,
with
the
music
,
which
rolled
on
the
floor
,
*NL*
and
sat
down
in
the
chair
close
by
her
.
He
had
never
done
so
before
,
*NL*
and
both
he
and
Maggie
were
quite
aware
that
it
was
an
entirely
new
*NL*
position
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
pampered
minion
!
''
said
Stephen
,
leaning
to
pull
the
long
*NL*
curly
ears
that
drooped
over
Maggie
's
arm
.
It
was
not
a
suggestive
*NL*
remark
,
and
as
the
speaker
did
not
follow
it
up
by
further
*NL*
development
,
it
naturally
left
the
conversation
at
a
standstill
.
It
*NL*
seemed
to
Stephen
like
some
action
in
a
dream
that
he
was
obliged
to
*NL*
do
,
and
wonder
at
himself
all
the
while
,
--
to
go
on
stroking
Minny
's
*NL*
head
.
Yet
it
was
very
pleasant
;
he
only
wished
he
dared
look
at
*NL*
Maggie
,
and
that
she
would
look
at
him
,
--
let
him
have
one
long
look
*NL*
into
those
deep
,
strange
eyes
of
hers
,
and
then
he
would
be
satisfied
*NL*
and
quite
reasonable
after
that
.
He
thought
it
was
becoming
a
sort
of
*NL*
monomania
with
him
,
to
want
that
long
look
from
Maggie
;
and
he
was
*NL*
racking
his
invention
continually
to
find
out
some
means
by
which
he
*NL*
could
have
it
without
its
appearing
singular
and
entailing
subsequent
*NL*
embarrassment
.
As
for
Maggie
,
she
had
no
distinct
thought
,
only
the
*NL*
sense
of
a
presence
like
that
of
a
closely
hovering
broad-winged
bird
*NL*
in
the
darkness
,
for
she
was
unable
to
look
up
,
and
saw
nothing
but
*NL*
Minny
's
black
wavy
coat
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
this
must
end
some
time
,
perhaps
it
ended
very
soon
,
and
only
*NL*
_
seemed
_
long
,
as
a
minute
's
dream
does
.
Stephen
at
last
sat
upright
*NL*
sideways
in
his
chair
,
leaning
one
hand
and
arm
over
the
back
and
*NL*
looking
at
Maggie
.
What
should
he
say
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
shall
have
a
splendid
sunset
,
I
think
;
sha
'n'
t
you
go
out
and
see
*NL*
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
said
Maggie
.
Then
courageously
raising
her
eyes
and
*NL*
looking
out
of
the
window
,
``
if
I
'm
not
playing
cribbage
with
my
*NL*
uncle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
pause
;
during
which
Minny
is
stroked
again
,
but
has
sufficient
*NL*
insight
not
to
be
grateful
for
it
,
to
growl
rather
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
like
sitting
alone
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
rather
arch
look
came
over
Maggie
's
face
,
and
,
just
glancing
at
*NL*
Stephen
,
she
said
,
``
Would
it
be
quite
civil
to
say
`
yes
'
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
_
was
_
rather
a
dangerous
question
for
an
intruder
to
ask
,
''
said
*NL*
Stephen
,
delighted
with
that
glance
,
and
getting
determined
to
stay
*NL*
for
another
.
``
But
you
will
have
more
than
half
an
hour
to
yourself
*NL*
after
I
am
gone
,
''
he
added
,
taking
out
his
watch
.
``
I
know
Mr.
Deane
*NL*
never
comes
in
till
half-past
seven
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Another
pause
,
during
which
Maggie
looked
steadily
out
of
the
window
,
*NL*
till
by
a
great
effort
she
moved
her
head
to
look
down
at
Minny
's
back
*NL*
again
,
and
said
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
Lucy
had
not
been
obliged
to
go
out
.
We
lose
our
music
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
shall
have
a
new
voice
to-morrow
night
,
''
said
Stephen
.
``
Will
you
*NL*
tell
your
cousin
that
our
friend
Philip
Wakem
is
come
back
?
I
saw
him
*NL*
as
I
went
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
gave
a
little
start
,
--
it
seemed
hardly
more
than
a
vibration
*NL*
that
passed
from
head
to
foot
in
an
instant
.
But
the
new
images
*NL*
summoned
by
Philip
's
name
dispersed
half
the
oppressive
spell
she
had
*NL*
been
under
.
She
rose
from
her
chair
with
a
sudden
resolution
,
and
*NL*
laying
Minny
on
his
cushion
,
went
to
reach
Lucy
's
large
work-basket
*NL*
from
its
corner
.
Stephen
was
vexed
and
disappointed
;
he
thought
*NL*
perhaps
Maggie
did
n't
like
the
name
of
Wakem
to
be
mentioned
to
her
in
*NL*
that
abrupt
way
,
for
he
now
recalled
what
Lucy
had
told
him
of
the
*NL*
family
quarrel
.
It
was
of
no
use
to
stay
any
longer
.
Maggie
was
*NL*
seating
herself
at
the
table
with
her
work
,
and
looking
chill
and
*NL*
proud
;
and
he
--
he
looked
like
a
simpleton
for
having
come
.
A
*NL*
gratuitous
,
entirely
superfluous
visit
of
that
sort
was
sure
to
make
a
*NL*
man
disagreeable
and
ridiculous
.
Of
course
it
was
palpable
to
Maggie
's
*NL*
thinking
that
he
had
dined
hastily
in
his
own
room
for
the
sake
of
*NL*
setting
off
again
and
finding
her
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
boyish
state
of
mind
for
an
accomplished
young
gentleman
of
*NL*
five-and-twenty
,
not
without
legal
knowledge
!
But
a
reference
to
*NL*
history
,
perhaps
,
may
make
it
not
incredible
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
moment
Maggie
's
ball
of
knitting-wool
rolled
along
the
ground
,
*NL*
and
she
started
up
to
reach
it
.
Stephen
rose
too
,
and
picking
up
the
*NL*
ball
,
met
her
with
a
vexed
,
complaining
look
that
gave
his
eyes
quite
*NL*
a
new
expression
to
Maggie
,
whose
own
eyes
met
them
as
he
presented
*NL*
the
ball
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-bye
,
''
said
Stephen
,
in
a
tone
that
had
the
same
beseeching
*NL*
discontent
as
his
eyes
.
He
dared
not
put
out
his
hand
;
he
thrust
both
*NL*
hands
into
his
tail-pockets
as
he
spoke
.
Maggie
thought
she
had
*NL*
perhaps
been
rude
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wo
n't
you
stay
?
''
she
said
timidly
,
not
looking
away
,
for
that
would
*NL*
have
seemed
rude
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
thank
you
,
''
said
Stephen
,
looking
still
into
the
half-unwilling
,
*NL*
half-fascinated
eyes
,
as
a
thirsty
man
looks
toward
the
track
of
the
*NL*
distant
brook
.
``
The
boat
is
waiting
for
me
.
You
'll
tell
your
cousin
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
I
brought
the
music
,
I
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
that
Philip
is
come
back
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
-LRB-
Maggie
did
not
notice
Philip
's
name
this
time
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wo
n't
you
come
out
a
little
way
into
the
garden
?
''
said
Stephen
,
in
a
*NL*
still
gentler
tone
;
but
the
next
moment
he
was
vexed
that
she
did
not
*NL*
say
``
No
,
''
for
she
moved
away
now
toward
the
open
window
,
and
he
was
*NL*
obliged
to
take
his
hat
and
walk
by
her
side
.
But
he
thought
of
*NL*
something
to
make
him
amends
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
take
my
arm
,
''
he
said
,
in
a
low
tone
,
as
if
it
were
a
secret
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
something
strangely
winning
to
most
women
in
that
offer
of
*NL*
the
firm
arm
;
the
help
is
not
wanted
physically
at
that
moment
,
but
*NL*
the
sense
of
help
,
the
presence
of
strength
that
is
outside
them
and
*NL*
yet
theirs
,
meets
a
continual
want
of
the
imagination
.
Either
on
that
*NL*
ground
or
some
other
,
Maggie
took
the
arm
.
And
they
walked
together
*NL*
round
the
grassplot
and
under
the
drooping
green
of
the
laburnums
,
in
*NL*
the
same
dim
,
dreamy
state
as
they
had
been
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
*NL*
before
;
only
that
Stephen
had
had
the
look
he
longed
for
,
without
yet
*NL*
perceiving
in
himself
the
symptoms
of
returning
reasonableness
,
and
*NL*
Maggie
had
darting
thoughts
across
the
dimness
,
--
how
came
he
to
be
*NL*
there
?
Why
had
she
come
out
?
Not
a
word
was
spoken
.
If
it
had
been
,
*NL*
each
would
have
been
less
intensely
conscious
of
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
care
of
this
step
,
''
said
Stephen
at
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
will
go
in
now
,
''
said
Maggie
,
feeling
that
the
step
had
come
*NL*
like
a
rescue
.
``
Good-evening
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
an
instant
she
had
withdrawn
her
arm
,
and
was
running
back
to
the
*NL*
house
.
She
did
not
reflect
that
this
sudden
action
would
only
add
to
*NL*
the
embarrassing
recollections
of
the
last
half-hour
.
She
had
no
*NL*
thought
left
for
that
.
She
only
threw
herself
into
the
low
arm-chair
,
*NL*
and
burst
into
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Philip
,
Philip
,
I
wish
we
were
together
again
--
so
quietly
--
in
the
*NL*
Red
Deeps
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
looked
after
her
a
moment
,
then
went
on
to
the
boat
,
and
was
*NL*
soon
landed
at
the
wharf
.
He
spent
the
evening
in
the
billiard-room
,
*NL*
smoking
one
cigar
after
another
,
and
losing
``
lives
''
at
pool
.
But
he
*NL*
would
not
leave
off
.
He
was
determined
not
to
think
,
--
not
to
admit
any
*NL*
more
distinct
remembrance
than
was
urged
upon
him
by
the
perpetual
*NL*
presence
of
Maggie
.
He
was
looking
at
her
,
and
she
was
on
his
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
there
came
the
necessity
of
walking
home
in
the
cool
starlight
,
*NL*
and
with
it
the
necessity
of
cursing
his
own
folly
,
and
bitterly
*NL*
determining
that
he
would
never
trust
himself
alone
with
Maggie
again
.
*NL*
It
was
all
madness
;
he
was
in
love
,
thoroughly
attached
to
Lucy
,
and
*NL*
engaged
,
--
engaged
as
strongly
as
an
honorable
man
need
be
.
He
wished
*NL*
he
had
never
seen
this
Maggie
Tulliver
,
to
be
thrown
into
a
fever
by
*NL*
her
in
this
way
;
she
would
make
a
sweet
,
strange
,
troublesome
,
*NL*
adorable
wife
to
some
man
or
other
,
but
he
would
never
have
chosen
her
*NL*
himself
.
Did
she
feel
as
he
did
?
He
hoped
she
did
--
not
.
He
ought
not
*NL*
to
have
gone
.
He
would
master
himself
in
future
.
He
would
make
himself
*NL*
disagreeable
to
her
,
quarrel
with
her
perhaps
.
Quarrel
with
her
?
Was
*NL*
it
possible
to
quarrel
with
a
creature
who
had
such
eyes
,
--
defying
and
*NL*
deprecating
,
contradicting
and
clinging
,
imperious
and
beseeching
,
--
*NL*
full
of
delicious
opposites
?
To
see
such
a
creature
subdued
by
love
*NL*
for
one
would
be
a
lot
worth
having
--
to
another
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
muttered
exclamation
which
ended
this
inward
soliloquy
,
as
*NL*
Stephen
threw
away
the
end
of
his
last
cigar
,
and
thrusting
his
hands
*NL*
into
his
pockets
,
stalked
along
at
a
quieter
pace
through
the
*NL*
shrubbery
.
It
was
not
of
a
benedictory
kind
.

Chapter
VII
*NL*
*NL*
Philip
Re-enters
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
morning
was
very
wet
,
--
the
sort
of
morning
on
which
male
*NL*
neighbors
who
have
no
imperative
occupation
at
home
are
likely
to
pay
*NL*
their
fair
friends
an
illimitable
visit
.
The
rain
,
which
has
been
*NL*
endurable
enough
for
the
walk
or
ride
one
way
,
is
sure
to
become
so
*NL*
heavy
,
and
at
the
same
time
so
certain
to
clear
up
by
and
by
,
that
*NL*
nothing
but
an
open
quarrel
can
abbreviate
the
visit
;
latent
*NL*
detestation
will
not
do
at
all
.
And
if
people
happen
to
be
lovers
,
*NL*
what
can
be
so
delightful
,
in
England
,
as
a
rainy
morning
?
English
*NL*
sunshine
is
dubious
;
bonnets
are
never
quite
secure
;
and
if
you
sit
*NL*
down
on
the
grass
,
it
may
lead
to
catarrhs
.
But
the
rain
is
to
be
*NL*
depended
on
.
You
gallop
through
it
in
a
mackintosh
,
and
presently
find
*NL*
yourself
in
the
seat
you
like
best
,
--
a
little
above
or
a
little
below
*NL*
the
one
on
which
your
goddess
sits
-LRB-
it
is
the
same
thing
to
the
*NL*
metaphysical
mind
,
and
that
is
the
reason
why
women
are
at
once
*NL*
worshipped
and
looked
down
upon
-RRB-
,
with
a
satisfactory
confidence
that
*NL*
there
will
be
no
lady-callers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stephen
will
come
earlier
this
morning
,
I
know
,
''
said
Lucy
;
``
he
*NL*
always
does
when
it
's
rainy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
made
no
answer
.
She
was
angry
with
Stephen
;
she
began
to
think
*NL*
she
should
dislike
him
;
and
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
rain
,
she
would
*NL*
have
gone
to
her
aunt
Glegg
's
this
morning
,
and
so
have
avoided
him
*NL*
altogether
.
As
it
was
,
she
must
find
some
reason
for
remaining
out
of
*NL*
the
room
with
her
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Stephen
did
not
come
earlier
,
and
there
was
another
visitor
--
a
*NL*
nearer
neighbor
--
who
preceded
him
.
When
Philip
entered
the
room
,
he
*NL*
was
going
merely
to
bow
to
Maggie
,
feeling
that
their
acquaintance
was
*NL*
a
secret
which
he
was
bound
not
to
betray
;
but
when
she
advanced
*NL*
toward
him
and
put
out
her
hand
,
he
guessed
at
once
that
Lucy
had
been
*NL*
taken
into
her
confidence
.
It
was
a
moment
of
some
agitation
to
both
,
*NL*
though
Philip
had
spent
many
hours
in
preparing
for
it
;
but
like
all
*NL*
persons
who
have
passed
through
life
with
little
expectation
of
*NL*
sympathy
,
he
seldom
lost
his
self-control
,
and
shrank
with
the
most
*NL*
sensitive
pride
from
any
noticeable
betrayal
of
emotion
.
A
little
*NL*
extra
paleness
,
a
little
tension
of
the
nostril
when
he
spoke
,
and
the
*NL*
voice
pitched
in
rather
a
higher
key
,
that
to
strangers
would
seem
*NL*
expressive
of
cold
indifference
,
were
all
the
signs
Philip
usually
*NL*
gave
of
an
inward
drama
that
was
not
without
its
fierceness
.
But
*NL*
Maggie
,
who
had
little
more
power
of
concealing
the
impressions
made
*NL*
upon
her
than
if
she
had
been
constructed
of
musical
strings
,
felt
her
*NL*
eyes
getting
larger
with
tears
as
they
took
each
other
's
hands
in
*NL*
silence
.
They
were
not
painful
tears
;
they
had
rather
something
of
the
*NL*
same
origin
as
the
tears
women
and
children
shed
when
they
have
found
*NL*
some
protection
to
cling
to
and
look
back
on
the
threatened
danger
.
*NL*
For
Philip
,
who
a
little
while
ago
was
associated
continually
in
*NL*
Maggie
's
mind
with
the
sense
that
Tom
might
reproach
her
with
some
*NL*
justice
,
had
now
,
in
this
short
space
,
become
a
sort
of
outward
*NL*
conscience
to
her
,
that
she
might
fly
to
for
rescue
and
strength
.
Her
*NL*
tranquil
,
tender
affection
for
Philip
,
with
its
root
deep
down
in
her
*NL*
childhood
,
and
its
memories
of
long
quiet
talk
confirming
by
distinct
*NL*
successive
impressions
the
first
instinctive
bias
,
--
the
fact
that
in
*NL*
him
the
appeal
was
more
strongly
to
her
pity
and
womanly
devotedness
*NL*
than
to
her
vanity
or
other
egoistic
excitability
of
her
*NL*
nature
,
--
seemed
now
to
make
a
sort
of
sacred
place
,
a
sanctuary
where
*NL*
she
could
find
refuge
from
an
alluring
influence
which
the
best
part
*NL*
of
herself
must
resist
;
which
must
bring
horrible
tumult
within
,
*NL*
wretchedness
without
.
This
new
sense
of
her
relation
to
Philip
*NL*
nullified
the
anxious
scruples
she
would
otherwise
have
felt
,
lest
she
*NL*
should
overstep
the
limit
of
intercourse
with
him
that
Tom
would
*NL*
sanction
;
and
she
put
out
her
hand
to
him
,
and
felt
the
tears
in
her
*NL*
eyes
without
any
consciousness
of
an
inward
check
.
The
scene
was
just
*NL*
what
Lucy
expected
,
and
her
kind
heart
delighted
in
bringing
Philip
*NL*
and
Maggie
together
again
;
though
,
even
with
all
_
her
_
regard
for
*NL*
Philip
,
she
could
not
resist
the
impression
that
her
cousin
Tom
had
*NL*
some
excuse
for
feeling
shocked
at
the
physical
incongruity
between
*NL*
the
two
,
--
a
prosaic
person
like
cousin
Tom
,
who
did
n't
like
poetry
and
*NL*
fairy
tales
.
But
she
began
to
speak
as
soon
as
possible
,
to
set
them
*NL*
at
ease
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
was
very
good
and
virtuous
of
you
,
''
she
said
,
in
her
pretty
*NL*
treble
,
like
the
low
conversational
notes
of
little
birds
,
``
to
come
so
*NL*
soon
after
your
arrival
.
And
as
it
is
,
I
think
I
will
pardon
you
for
*NL*
running
away
in
an
inopportune
manner
,
and
giving
your
friends
no
*NL*
notice
.
Come
and
sit
down
here
,
''
she
went
on
,
placing
the
chair
that
*NL*
would
suit
him
best
,
``
and
you
shall
find
yourself
treated
mercifully
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
never
govern
well
,
Miss
Deane
,
''
said
Philip
,
as
he
seated
*NL*
himself
,
``
because
no
one
will
ever
believe
in
your
severity
.
People
*NL*
will
always
encourage
themselves
in
misdemeanors
by
the
certainty
that
*NL*
you
will
be
indulgent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
gave
some
playful
contradiction
,
but
Philip
did
not
hear
what
it
*NL*
was
,
for
he
had
naturally
turned
toward
Maggie
,
and
she
was
looking
at
*NL*
him
with
that
open
,
affectionate
scrutiny
which
we
give
to
a
friend
*NL*
from
whom
we
have
been
long
separated
.
What
a
moment
their
parting
had
*NL*
been
!
And
Philip
felt
as
if
he
were
only
in
the
morrow
of
it
.
He
felt
*NL*
this
so
keenly
,
--
with
such
intense
,
detailed
remembrance
,
with
such
*NL*
passionate
revival
of
all
that
had
been
said
and
looked
in
their
last
*NL*
conversation
,
--
that
with
that
jealousy
and
distrust
which
in
diffident
*NL*
natures
is
almost
inevitably
linked
with
a
strong
feeling
,
he
thought
*NL*
he
read
in
Maggie
's
glance
and
manner
the
evidence
of
a
change
.
The
*NL*
very
fact
that
he
feared
and
half
expected
it
would
be
sure
to
make
*NL*
this
thought
rush
in
,
in
the
absence
of
positive
proof
to
the
*NL*
contrary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
having
a
great
holiday
,
am
I
not
?
''
said
Maggie
.
``
Lucy
is
like
a
*NL*
fairy
godmother
;
she
has
turned
me
from
a
drudge
into
a
princess
in
no
*NL*
time
.
I
do
nothing
but
indulge
myself
all
day
long
,
and
she
always
*NL*
finds
out
what
I
want
before
I
know
it
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sure
she
is
the
happier
for
having
you
,
then
,
''
said
Philip
.
``
You
*NL*
must
be
better
than
a
whole
menagerie
of
pets
to
her
.
And
you
look
*NL*
well
.
You
are
benefiting
by
the
change
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Artificial
conversation
of
this
sort
went
on
a
little
while
,
till
*NL*
Lucy
,
determined
to
put
an
end
to
it
,
exclaimed
,
with
a
good
imitation
*NL*
of
annoyance
,
that
she
had
forgotten
something
,
and
was
quickly
out
of
*NL*
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
moment
Maggie
and
Philip
leaned
forward
,
and
the
hands
were
*NL*
clasped
again
,
with
a
look
of
sad
contentment
,
like
that
of
friends
*NL*
who
meet
in
the
memory
of
recent
sorrow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
told
my
brother
I
wished
to
see
you
,
Philip
;
I
asked
him
to
release
*NL*
me
from
my
promise
,
and
he
consented
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
,
in
her
impulsiveness
,
wanted
Philip
to
know
at
once
the
*NL*
position
they
must
hold
toward
each
other
;
but
she
checked
herself
.
*NL*
The
things
that
had
happened
since
he
had
spoken
of
his
love
for
her
*NL*
were
so
painful
that
she
shrank
from
being
the
first
to
allude
to
them
.
*NL*
It
seemed
almost
like
an
injury
toward
Philip
even
to
mention
her
*NL*
brother
,
--
her
brother
,
who
had
insulted
him
.
But
he
was
thinking
too
*NL*
entirely
of
her
to
be
sensitive
on
any
other
point
at
that
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
we
can
at
least
be
friends
,
Maggie
?
There
is
nothing
to
hinder
*NL*
that
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
not
your
father
object
?
''
said
Maggie
,
withdrawing
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
not
give
you
up
on
any
ground
but
your
own
wish
,
Maggie
,
''
*NL*
said
Philip
,
coloring
.
``
There
are
points
on
which
I
should
always
*NL*
resist
my
father
,
as
I
used
to
tell
you
.
_
That
_
is
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
there
is
nothing
to
hinder
our
being
friends
,
Philip
,
--
seeing
*NL*
each
other
and
talking
to
each
other
while
I
am
here
;
I
shall
soon
go
*NL*
away
again
.
I
mean
to
go
very
soon
,
to
a
new
situation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
inevitable
,
Maggie
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
I
must
not
stay
here
long
.
It
would
unfit
me
for
the
life
I
must
*NL*
begin
again
at
last
.
I
ca
n't
live
in
dependence
,
--
I
ca
n't
live
with
my
*NL*
brother
,
though
he
is
very
good
to
me
.
He
would
like
to
provide
for
*NL*
me
;
but
that
would
be
intolerable
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Philip
was
silent
a
few
moments
,
and
then
said
,
in
that
high
,
feeble
*NL*
voice
which
with
him
indicated
the
resolute
suppression
of
emotion
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
there
no
other
alternative
,
Maggie
?
Is
that
life
,
away
from
those
*NL*
who
love
you
,
the
only
one
you
will
allow
yourself
to
look
forward
*NL*
to
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Philip
,
''
she
said
,
looking
at
him
pleadingly
,
as
if
she
*NL*
entreated
him
to
believe
that
she
was
compelled
to
this
course
.
``
At
*NL*
least
,
as
things
are
;
I
do
n't
know
what
may
be
in
years
to
come
.
But
I
*NL*
begin
to
think
there
can
never
come
much
happiness
to
me
from
loving
;
*NL*
I
have
always
had
so
much
pain
mingled
with
it
.
I
wish
I
could
make
*NL*
myself
a
world
outside
it
,
as
men
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
you
are
returning
to
your
old
thought
in
a
new
form
,
Maggie
,
--
the
*NL*
thought
I
used
to
combat
,
''
said
Philip
,
with
a
slight
tinge
of
*NL*
bitterness
.
``
You
want
to
find
out
a
mode
of
renunciation
that
will
be
*NL*
an
escape
from
pain
.
I
tell
you
again
,
there
is
no
such
escape
*NL*
possible
except
by
perverting
or
mutilating
one
's
nature
.
What
would
*NL*
become
of
me
,
if
I
tried
to
escape
from
pain
?
Scorn
and
cynicism
would
*NL*
be
my
only
opium
;
unless
I
could
fall
into
some
kind
of
conceited
*NL*
madness
,
and
fancy
myself
a
favorite
of
Heaven
because
I
am
not
a
*NL*
favorite
with
men
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
bitterness
had
taken
on
some
impetuosity
as
Philip
went
on
*NL*
speaking
;
the
words
were
evidently
an
outlet
for
some
immediate
*NL*
feeling
of
his
own
,
as
well
as
an
answer
to
Maggie
.
There
was
a
pain
*NL*
pressing
on
him
at
that
moment
.
He
shrank
with
proud
delicacy
from
the
*NL*
faintest
allusion
to
the
words
of
love
,
of
plighted
love
that
had
*NL*
passed
between
them
.
It
would
have
seemed
to
him
like
reminding
Maggie
*NL*
of
a
promise
;
it
would
have
had
for
him
something
of
the
baseness
of
*NL*
compulsion
.
He
could
not
dwell
on
the
fact
that
he
himself
had
not
*NL*
changed
;
for
that
too
would
have
had
the
air
of
an
appeal
.
His
love
*NL*
for
Maggie
was
stamped
,
even
more
than
the
rest
of
his
experience
,
*NL*
with
the
exaggerated
sense
that
he
was
an
exception
,
--
that
she
,
that
*NL*
every
one
,
saw
him
in
the
light
of
an
exception
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Maggie
was
conscience-stricken
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Philip
,
''
she
said
,
with
her
childish
contrition
when
he
used
to
*NL*
chide
her
,
``
you
are
right
,
I
know
.
I
do
always
think
too
much
of
my
*NL*
own
feelings
,
and
not
enough
of
others
'
,
--
not
enough
of
yours
.
I
had
*NL*
need
have
you
always
to
find
fault
with
me
and
teach
me
;
so
many
*NL*
things
have
come
true
that
you
used
to
tell
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
was
resting
her
elbow
on
the
table
,
leaning
her
head
on
her
*NL*
hand
and
looking
at
Philip
with
half-penitent
dependent
affection
,
as
*NL*
she
said
this
;
while
he
was
returning
her
gaze
with
an
expression
*NL*
that
,
to
her
consciousness
,
gradually
became
less
vague
,
--
became
*NL*
charged
with
a
specific
recollection
.
Had
his
mind
flown
back
to
*NL*
something
that
_
she
_
now
remembered
,
--
something
about
a
lover
of
*NL*
Lucy
's
?
It
was
a
thought
that
made
her
shudder
;
it
gave
new
*NL*
definiteness
to
her
present
position
,
and
to
the
tendency
of
what
had
*NL*
happened
the
evening
before
.
She
moved
her
arm
from
the
table
,
urged
*NL*
to
change
her
position
by
that
positive
physical
oppression
at
the
*NL*
heart
that
sometimes
accompanies
a
sudden
mental
pang
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
matter
,
Maggie
?
Has
something
happened
?
''
Philip
said
,
in
*NL*
inexpressible
anxiety
,
his
imagination
being
only
too
ready
to
weave
*NL*
everything
that
was
fatal
to
them
both
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
nothing
,
''
said
Maggie
,
rousing
her
latent
will
.
Philip
must
not
*NL*
have
that
odious
thought
in
his
mind
;
she
would
banish
it
from
her
*NL*
own
.
``
Nothing
,
''
she
repeated
,
``
except
in
my
own
mind
.
You
used
to
say
*NL*
I
should
feel
the
effect
of
my
starved
life
,
as
you
called
it
;
and
I
*NL*
do
.
I
am
too
eager
in
my
enjoyment
of
music
and
all
luxuries
,
now
they
*NL*
are
come
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
took
up
her
work
and
occupied
herself
resolutely
,
while
Philip
*NL*
watched
her
,
really
in
doubt
whether
she
had
anything
more
than
this
*NL*
general
allusion
in
her
mind
.
It
was
quite
in
Maggie
's
character
to
be
*NL*
agitated
by
vague
self-reproach
.
But
soon
there
came
a
violent
*NL*
well-known
ring
at
the
door-bell
resounding
through
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
what
a
startling
announcement
!
''
said
Maggie
,
quite
mistress
of
*NL*
herself
,
though
not
without
some
inward
flutter
.
``
I
wonder
where
Lucy
*NL*
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
had
not
been
deaf
to
the
signal
,
and
after
an
interval
long
*NL*
enough
for
a
few
solicitous
but
not
hurried
inquiries
,
she
herself
*NL*
ushered
Stephen
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
old
fellow
,
''
he
said
,
going
straight
up
to
Philip
and
shaking
*NL*
him
heartily
by
the
hand
,
bowing
to
Maggie
in
passing
,
``
it
's
glorious
*NL*
to
have
you
back
again
;
only
I
wish
you
'd
conduct
yourself
a
little
*NL*
less
like
a
sparrow
with
a
residence
on
the
house-top
,
and
not
go
in
*NL*
and
out
constantly
without
letting
the
servants
know
.
This
is
about
*NL*
the
twentieth
time
I
've
had
to
scamper
up
those
countless
stairs
to
*NL*
that
painting-room
of
yours
,
all
to
no
purpose
,
because
your
people
*NL*
thought
you
were
at
home
.
Such
incidents
embitter
friendship
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
so
few
visitors
,
it
seems
hardly
worth
while
to
leave
notice
of
*NL*
my
exit
and
entrances
,
''
said
Philip
,
feeling
rather
oppressed
just
*NL*
then
by
Stephen
's
bright
strong
presence
and
strong
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
quite
well
this
morning
,
Miss
Tulliver
?
''
said
Stephen
,
*NL*
turning
to
Maggie
with
stiff
politeness
,
and
putting
out
his
hand
with
*NL*
the
air
of
fulfilling
a
social
duty
.
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
gave
the
tips
of
her
fingers
,
and
said
,
``
Quite
well
,
thank
*NL*
you
,
''
in
a
tone
of
proud
indifference
.
Philip
's
eyes
were
watching
*NL*
them
keenly
;
but
Lucy
was
used
to
seeing
variations
in
their
manner
to
*NL*
each
other
,
and
only
thought
with
regret
that
there
was
some
natural
*NL*
antipathy
which
every
now
and
then
surmounted
their
mutual
good-will
.
*NL*
``
Maggie
is
not
the
sort
of
woman
Stephen
admires
,
and
she
is
irritated
*NL*
by
something
in
him
which
she
interprets
as
conceit
,
''
was
the
silent
*NL*
observation
that
accounted
for
everything
to
guileless
Lucy
.
Stephen
*NL*
and
Maggie
had
no
sooner
completed
this
studied
greeting
than
each
*NL*
felt
hurt
by
the
other
's
coldness
.
And
Stephen
,
while
rattling
on
in
*NL*
questions
to
Philip
about
his
recent
sketching
expedition
,
was
*NL*
thinking
all
the
more
about
Maggie
because
he
was
not
drawing
her
into
*NL*
the
conversation
as
he
had
invariably
done
before
.
``
Maggie
and
Philip
*NL*
are
not
looking
happy
,
''
thought
Lucy
;
``
this
first
interview
has
been
*NL*
saddening
to
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
we
people
who
have
not
been
galloping
,
''
she
said
to
Stephen
,
*NL*
``
are
all
a
little
damped
by
the
rain
.
Let
us
have
some
music
.
We
ought
*NL*
to
take
advantage
of
having
Philip
and
you
together
.
Give
us
the
duet
*NL*
in
`
Masaniello
'
;
Maggie
has
not
heard
that
,
and
I
know
it
will
suit
*NL*
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
then
,
''
said
Stephen
,
going
toward
the
piano
,
and
giving
a
*NL*
foretaste
of
the
tune
in
his
deep
``
brum-brum
,
''
very
pleasant
to
hear
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
,
please
,
Philip
,
--
you
play
the
accompaniment
,
''
said
Lucy
,
``
and
*NL*
then
I
can
go
on
with
my
work
.
You
_
will
_
like
to
play
,
sha
'n'
t
you
?
''
*NL*
she
added
,
with
a
pretty
,
inquiring
look
,
anxious
,
as
usual
,
lest
she
*NL*
should
have
proposed
what
was
not
pleasant
to
another
;
but
with
*NL*
yearnings
toward
her
unfinished
embroidery
.
*NL*
*NL*
Philip
had
brightened
at
the
proposition
,
for
there
is
no
feeling
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
except
the
extremes
of
fear
and
grief
,
that
does
not
find
*NL*
relief
in
music
,
--
that
does
not
make
a
man
sing
or
play
the
better
;
*NL*
and
Philip
had
an
abundance
of
pent-up
feeling
at
this
moment
,
as
*NL*
complex
as
any
trio
or
quartet
that
was
ever
meant
to
express
love
and
*NL*
jealousy
and
resignation
and
fierce
suspicion
,
all
at
the
same
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
''
he
said
,
seating
himself
at
the
piano
,
``
it
is
a
way
of
*NL*
eking
out
one
's
imperfect
life
and
being
three
people
at
once
,
--
to
*NL*
sing
and
make
the
piano
sing
,
and
hear
them
both
all
the
while
,
--
or
*NL*
else
to
sing
and
paint
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
there
you
are
an
enviable
fellow
.
I
can
do
nothing
with
my
*NL*
hands
,
''
said
Stephen
.
``
That
has
generally
been
observed
in
men
of
*NL*
great
administrative
capacity
,
I
believe
,
--
a
tendency
to
predominance
*NL*
of
the
reflective
powers
in
me
!
Have
n't
you
observed
that
,
Miss
*NL*
Tulliver
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
had
fallen
by
mistake
into
his
habit
of
playful
appeal
to
*NL*
Maggie
,
and
she
could
not
repress
the
answering
flush
and
epigram
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
_
have
_
observed
a
tendency
to
predominance
,
''
she
said
,
smiling
;
and
*NL*
Philip
at
that
moment
devoutly
hoped
that
she
found
the
tendency
*NL*
disagreeable
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
come
,
''
said
Lucy
;
``
music
,
music
!
We
will
discuss
each
other
's
*NL*
qualities
another
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
always
tried
in
vain
to
go
on
with
her
work
when
music
began
.
*NL*
She
tried
harder
than
ever
to-day
;
for
the
thought
that
Stephen
knew
*NL*
how
much
she
cared
for
his
singing
was
one
that
no
longer
roused
a
*NL*
merely
playful
resistance
;
and
she
knew
,
too
,
that
it
was
his
habit
*NL*
always
to
stand
so
that
he
could
look
at
her
.
But
it
was
of
no
use
;
*NL*
she
soon
threw
her
work
down
,
and
all
her
intentions
were
lost
in
the
*NL*
vague
state
of
emotion
produced
by
the
inspiring
duet
,
--
emotion
that
*NL*
seemed
to
make
her
at
once
strong
and
weak
;
strong
for
all
enjoyment
,
*NL*
weak
for
all
resistance
.
When
the
strain
passed
into
the
minor
,
she
*NL*
half
started
from
her
seat
with
the
sudden
thrill
of
that
change
.
Poor
*NL*
Maggie
!
She
looked
very
beautiful
when
her
soul
was
being
played
on
in
*NL*
this
way
by
the
inexorable
power
of
sound
.
You
might
have
seen
the
*NL*
slightest
perceptible
quivering
through
her
whole
frame
as
she
leaned
*NL*
a
little
forward
,
clasping
her
hands
as
if
to
steady
herself
;
while
*NL*
her
eyes
dilated
and
brightened
into
that
wide-open
,
childish
*NL*
expression
of
wondering
delight
which
always
came
back
in
her
happiest
*NL*
moments
.
Lucy
,
who
at
other
times
had
always
been
at
the
piano
when
*NL*
Maggie
was
looking
in
this
way
,
could
not
resist
the
impulse
to
steal
*NL*
up
to
her
and
kiss
her
.
Philip
,
too
,
caught
a
glimpse
of
her
now
and
*NL*
then
round
the
open
book
on
the
desk
,
and
felt
that
he
had
never
*NL*
before
seen
her
under
so
strong
an
influence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
More
,
more
!
''
said
Lucy
,
when
the
duet
had
been
encored
.
``
Something
*NL*
spirited
again
.
Maggie
always
says
she
likes
a
great
rush
of
sound
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
must
be
`
Let
us
take
the
road
,
'
then
,
''
said
Stephen
,
--
``
so
suitable
*NL*
for
a
wet
morning
.
But
are
you
prepared
to
abandon
the
most
sacred
*NL*
duties
of
life
,
and
come
and
sing
with
us
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
''
said
Lucy
,
laughing
.
``
If
you
will
look
out
the
`
Beggar
's
*NL*
Opera
'
from
the
large
canterbury
.
It
has
a
dingy
cover
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
a
great
clue
,
considering
there
are
about
a
score
covers
here
*NL*
of
rival
dinginess
,
''
said
Stephen
,
drawing
out
the
canterbury
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
play
something
the
while
,
Philip
,
''
said
Lucy
,
noticing
that
his
*NL*
fingers
were
wandering
over
the
keys
.
``
What
is
that
you
are
falling
*NL*
into
?
--
something
delicious
that
I
do
n't
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
know
that
?
''
said
Philip
,
bringing
out
the
tune
more
*NL*
definitely
.
``
It
's
from
the
`
Sonnambula
'
--
`
Ah
!
perche
non
posso
*NL*
odiarti
.
'
I
do
n't
know
the
opera
,
but
it
appears
the
tenor
is
telling
*NL*
the
heroine
that
he
shall
always
love
her
though
she
may
forsake
him
.
*NL*
You
've
heard
me
sing
it
to
the
English
words
,
'
I
love
thee
still
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
quite
unintentionally
that
Philip
had
wandered
into
this
*NL*
song
,
which
might
be
an
indirect
expression
to
Maggie
of
what
he
could
*NL*
not
prevail
on
himself
to
say
to
her
directly
.
Her
ears
had
been
open
*NL*
to
what
he
was
saying
,
and
when
he
began
to
sing
,
she
understood
the
*NL*
plaintive
passion
of
the
music
.
That
pleading
tenor
had
no
very
fine
*NL*
qualities
as
a
voice
,
but
it
was
not
quite
new
to
her
;
it
had
sung
to
*NL*
her
by
snatches
,
in
a
subdued
way
,
among
the
grassy
walks
and
hollows
,
*NL*
and
underneath
the
leaning
ash-tree
in
the
Red
Deeps
.
There
seemed
to
*NL*
be
some
reproach
in
the
words
;
did
Philip
mean
that
?
She
wished
she
*NL*
had
assured
him
more
distinctly
in
their
conversation
that
she
desired
*NL*
not
to
renew
the
hope
of
love
between
them
,
_
only
_
because
it
clashed
*NL*
with
her
inevitable
circumstances
.
She
was
touched
,
not
thrilled
by
*NL*
the
song
;
it
suggested
distinct
memories
and
thoughts
,
and
brought
*NL*
quiet
regret
in
the
place
of
excitement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
the
way
with
you
tenors
,
''
said
Stephen
,
who
was
waiting
with
*NL*
music
in
his
hand
while
Philip
finished
the
song
.
``
You
demoralize
the
*NL*
fair
sex
by
warbling
your
sentimental
love
and
constancy
under
all
*NL*
sorts
of
vile
treatment
.
Nothing
short
of
having
your
heads
served
up
*NL*
in
a
dish
like
that
mediaeval
tenor
or
troubadour
,
would
prevent
you
*NL*
from
expressing
your
entire
resignation
.
I
must
administer
an
*NL*
antidote
,
while
Miss
Deane
prepares
to
tear
herself
away
from
her
*NL*
bobbins
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
rolled
out
,
with
saucy
energy
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
I
,
wasting
in
despair
,
*NL*
Die
because
a
woman
's
fair
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
and
seemed
to
make
all
the
air
in
the
room
alive
with
a
new
influence
.
*NL*
Lucy
,
always
proud
of
what
Stephen
did
,
went
toward
the
piano
with
*NL*
laughing
,
admiring
looks
at
him
;
and
Maggie
,
in
spite
of
her
*NL*
resistance
to
the
spirit
of
the
song
and
to
the
singer
,
was
taken
hold
*NL*
of
and
shaken
by
the
invisible
influence
,
--
was
borne
along
by
a
wave
*NL*
too
strong
for
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
angrily
resolved
not
to
betray
herself
,
she
seized
her
work
,
and
*NL*
went
on
making
false
stitches
and
pricking
her
fingers
with
much
*NL*
perseverance
,
not
looking
up
or
taking
notice
of
what
was
going
*NL*
forward
,
until
all
the
three
voices
united
in
``
Let
us
take
the
road
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
am
afraid
there
would
have
been
a
subtle
,
stealing
gratification
in
*NL*
her
mind
if
she
had
known
how
entirely
this
saucy
,
defiant
Stephen
was
*NL*
occupied
with
her
;
how
he
was
passing
rapidly
from
a
determination
to
*NL*
treat
her
with
ostentatious
indifference
to
an
irritating
desire
for
*NL*
some
sign
of
inclination
from
her
,
--
some
interchange
of
subdued
word
*NL*
or
look
with
her
.
It
was
not
long
before
he
found
an
opportunity
,
when
*NL*
they
had
passed
to
the
music
of
``
The
Tempest
.
''
Maggie
,
feeling
the
*NL*
need
of
a
footstool
,
was
walking
across
the
room
to
get
one
,
when
*NL*
Stephen
,
who
was
not
singing
just
then
,
and
was
conscious
of
all
her
*NL*
movements
,
guessed
her
want
,
and
flew
to
anticipate
her
,
lifting
the
*NL*
footstool
with
an
entreating
look
at
her
,
which
made
it
impossible
not
*NL*
to
return
a
glance
of
gratitude
.
And
then
,
to
have
the
footstool
*NL*
placed
carefully
by
a
too
self-confident
personage
,
--
not
_
any
_
*NL*
self-confident
personage
,
but
one
in
particular
,
who
suddenly
looks
*NL*
humble
and
anxious
,
and
lingers
,
bending
still
,
to
ask
if
there
is
not
*NL*
some
draught
in
that
position
between
the
window
and
the
fireplace
,
*NL*
and
if
he
may
not
be
allowed
to
move
the
work-table
for
her
,
--
these
*NL*
things
will
summon
a
little
of
the
too
ready
,
traitorous
tenderness
*NL*
into
a
woman
's
eyes
,
compelled
as
she
is
in
her
girlish
time
to
learn
*NL*
her
life-lessons
in
very
trivial
language
.
And
to
Maggie
such
things
*NL*
had
not
been
every-day
incidents
,
but
were
a
new
element
in
her
life
,
*NL*
and
found
her
keen
appetite
for
homage
quite
fresh
.
That
tone
of
*NL*
gentle
solicitude
obliged
her
to
look
at
the
face
that
was
bent
toward
*NL*
her
,
and
to
say
,
``
No
,
thank
you
''
;
and
nothing
could
prevent
that
*NL*
mutual
glance
from
being
delicious
to
both
,
as
it
had
been
the
evening
*NL*
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
but
an
ordinary
act
of
politeness
in
Stephen
;
it
had
hardly
*NL*
taken
two
minutes
;
and
Lucy
,
who
was
singing
,
scarcely
noticed
it
.
But
*NL*
to
Philip
's
mind
,
filled
already
with
a
vague
anxiety
that
was
likely
*NL*
to
find
a
definite
ground
for
itself
in
any
trivial
incident
,
this
*NL*
sudden
eagerness
in
Stephen
,
and
the
change
in
Maggie
's
face
,
which
*NL*
was
plainly
reflecting
a
beam
from
his
,
seemed
so
strong
a
contrast
*NL*
with
the
previous
overwrought
signs
of
indifference
,
as
to
be
charged
*NL*
with
painful
meaning
.
Stephen
's
voice
,
pouring
in
again
,
jarred
upon
*NL*
his
nervous
susceptibility
as
if
it
had
been
the
clang
of
sheet-iron
,
*NL*
and
he
felt
inclined
to
make
the
piano
shriek
in
utter
discord
.
He
had
*NL*
really
seen
no
communicable
ground
for
suspecting
any
ususual
feeling
*NL*
between
Stephen
and
Maggie
;
his
own
reason
told
him
so
,
and
he
wanted
*NL*
to
go
home
at
once
that
he
might
reflect
coolly
on
these
false
images
,
*NL*
till
he
had
convinced
himself
of
their
nullity
.
But
then
,
again
,
he
*NL*
wanted
to
stay
as
long
as
Stephen
stayed
,
--
always
to
be
present
when
*NL*
Stephen
was
present
with
Maggie
.
It
seemed
to
poor
Philip
so
natural
,
*NL*
nay
,
inevitable
,
that
any
man
who
was
near
Maggie
should
fall
in
love
*NL*
with
her
!
There
was
no
promise
of
happiness
for
her
if
she
were
*NL*
beguiled
into
loving
Stephen
Guest
;
and
this
thought
emboldened
Philip
*NL*
to
view
his
own
love
for
her
in
the
light
of
a
less
unequal
offering
.
*NL*
He
was
beginning
to
play
very
falsely
under
this
deafening
inward
*NL*
tumult
,
and
Lucy
was
looking
at
him
in
astonishment
,
when
Mrs.
*NL*
Tulliver
's
entrance
to
summon
them
to
lunch
came
as
an
excuse
for
*NL*
abruptly
breaking
off
the
music
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
Mr.
Philip
!
''
said
Mr.
Deane
,
when
they
entered
the
dining-room
,
*NL*
``
I
've
not
seen
you
for
a
long
while
.
Your
father
's
not
at
home
,
I
*NL*
think
,
is
he
?
I
went
after
him
to
the
office
the
other
day
,
and
they
*NL*
said
he
was
out
of
town
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
been
to
Mudport
on
business
for
several
days
,
''
said
Philip
;
``
but
*NL*
he
's
come
back
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
fond
of
his
farming
hobby
as
ever
,
eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
so
,
''
said
Philip
,
rather
wondering
at
this
sudden
interest
*NL*
in
his
father
's
pursuits
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
said
Mr.
Deane
,
``
he
's
got
some
land
in
his
own
hands
on
this
*NL*
side
the
river
as
well
as
the
other
,
I
think
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
he
has
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
continued
Mr.
Deane
,
as
he
dispensed
the
pigeonpie
,
``
he
must
*NL*
find
farming
a
heavy
item
,
--
an
expensive
hobby
.
I
never
had
a
hobby
*NL*
myself
,
never
would
give
in
to
that
.
And
the
worst
of
all
hobbies
are
*NL*
those
that
people
think
they
can
get
money
at
.
They
shoot
their
money
*NL*
down
like
corn
out
of
a
sack
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
felt
a
little
nervous
under
her
father
's
apparently
gratuitous
*NL*
criticism
of
Mr.
Wakem
's
expenditure
.
But
it
ceased
there
,
and
Mr.
*NL*
Deane
became
unusually
silent
and
meditative
during
his
luncheon
.
*NL*
Lucy
,
accustomed
to
watch
all
indications
in
her
father
,
and
having
*NL*
reasons
,
which
had
recently
become
strong
,
for
an
extra
interest
in
*NL*
what
referred
to
the
Wakems
,
felt
an
unusual
curiosity
to
know
what
had
*NL*
prompted
her
father
's
questions
.
His
subsequent
silence
made
her
*NL*
suspect
there
had
been
some
special
reason
for
them
in
his
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
this
idea
in
her
head
,
she
resorted
to
her
usual
plan
when
she
*NL*
wanted
to
tell
or
ask
her
father
anything
particular
:
she
found
a
*NL*
reason
for
her
aunt
Tulliver
to
leaving
the
dining-room
after
dinner
,
*NL*
and
seated
herself
on
a
small
stool
at
her
father
's
knee
.
Mr.
Deane
,
*NL*
under
those
circumstances
,
considered
that
he
tasted
some
of
the
most
*NL*
agreeable
moments
his
merits
had
purchased
him
in
life
,
*NL*
notwithstanding
that
Lucy
,
disliking
to
have
her
hair
powdered
with
*NL*
snuff
,
usually
began
by
mastering
his
snuff-box
on
such
occasions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
want
to
go
to
sleep
yet
,
papa
,
_
do
_
you
?
''
she
said
,
as
she
*NL*
brought
up
her
stool
and
opened
the
large
fingers
that
clutched
the
*NL*
snuff-box
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
yet
,
''
said
Mr.
Deane
,
glancing
at
the
reward
of
merit
in
the
*NL*
decanter
.
``
But
what
do
_
you
_
want
?
''
he
added
,
pinching
the
dimpled
*NL*
chin
fondly
,
--
``
to
coax
some
more
sovereigns
out
of
my
pocket
for
your
*NL*
bazaar
?
Eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
have
no
base
motives
at
all
to-day
.
I
only
want
to
talk
,
not
to
*NL*
beg
.
I
want
to
know
what
made
you
ask
Philip
Wakem
about
his
father
's
*NL*
farming
to-day
,
papa
?
It
seemed
rather
odd
,
because
you
never
hardly
*NL*
say
anything
to
him
about
his
father
;
and
why
should
you
care
about
*NL*
Mr.
Wakem
's
losing
money
by
his
hobby
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Something
to
do
with
business
,
''
said
Mr.
Deane
,
waving
his
hands
,
as
*NL*
if
to
repel
intrusion
into
that
mystery
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
papa
,
you
always
say
Mr.
Wakem
has
brought
Philip
up
like
a
*NL*
girl
;
how
came
you
to
think
you
should
get
any
business
knowledge
out
*NL*
of
him
?
Those
abrupt
questions
sounded
rather
oddly
.
Philip
thought
*NL*
them
queer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nonsense
,
child
!
''
said
Mr.
Deane
,
willing
to
justify
his
social
*NL*
demeanor
,
with
which
he
had
taken
some
pains
in
his
upward
progress
.
*NL*
``
There
's
a
report
that
Wakem
's
mill
and
farm
on
the
other
side
of
the
*NL*
river
--
Dorlcote
Mill
,
your
uncle
Tulliver
's
,
you
know
--
is
n't
answering
*NL*
so
well
as
it
did
.
I
wanted
to
see
if
your
friend
Philip
would
let
*NL*
anything
out
about
his
father
's
being
tired
of
farming
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
Would
you
buy
the
mill
,
papa
,
if
he
would
part
with
it
?
''
said
*NL*
Lucy
,
eagerly
.
``
Oh
,
tell
me
everything
;
here
,
you
shall
have
your
*NL*
snuff-box
if
you
'll
tell
me
.
Because
Maggie
says
all
their
hearts
are
*NL*
set
on
Tom
's
getting
back
the
mill
some
time
.
It
was
one
of
the
last
*NL*
things
her
father
said
to
Tom
,
that
he
must
get
back
the
mill
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hush
,
you
little
puss
,
''
said
Mr.
Deane
,
availing
himself
of
the
*NL*
restored
snuff-box
.
``
You
must
not
say
a
word
about
this
thing
;
do
you
*NL*
hear
?
There
's
very
little
chance
of
their
getting
the
mill
or
of
*NL*
anybody
's
getting
it
out
of
Wakem
's
hands
.
And
if
he
knew
that
we
*NL*
wanted
it
with
a
view
to
the
Tulliver
's
getting
it
again
,
he
'd
be
the
*NL*
less
likely
to
part
with
it
.
It
's
natural
,
after
what
happened
.
He
*NL*
behaved
well
enough
to
Tulliver
before
;
but
a
horsewhipping
is
not
*NL*
likely
to
be
paid
for
with
sugar-plums
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
papa

''
said
Lucy
,
with
a
little
air
of
solemnity
,
``
will
you

trust
me

You

not
ask

all
my

I
have
very

Mr.

puzzled

``

then
,
with
a
sudden
penetrating
look
at
his

felt
quite
safe
about

Lucy
rose
from
her
stool
to
seat
herself
on
her
father

kissed
him
with
that
last

Chapter

*NL*
*NL*
Wakem
in

New
Light
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Before
three
days
had
passed
after
the
conversation
you
have
just
*NL*
overheard
between
Lucy
and
her
father
she
had
contrived
to
have
a
*NL*
private
interview
with
Philip
during
a
visit
of
Maggie
's
to
her
aunt
*NL*
Glegg
.
For
a
day
and
a
night
Philip
turned
over
in
his
mind
with
*NL*
restless
agitation
all
that
Lucy
had
told
him
in
that
interview
,
till
*NL*
he
had
thoroughly
resolved
on
a
course
of
action
.
He
thought
he
saw
*NL*
before
him
now
a
possibility
of
altering
his
position
with
respect
to
*NL*
Maggie
,
and
removing
at
least
one
obstacle
between
them
.
He
laid
his
*NL*
plan
and
calculated
all
his
moves
with
the
fervid
deliberation
of
a
*NL*
chess-player
in
the
days
of
his
first
ardor
,
and
was
amazed
himself
at
*NL*
his
sudden
genius
as
a
tactician
.
His
plan
was
as
bold
as
it
was
*NL*
thoroughly
calculated
.
Having
watched
for
a
moment
when
his
father
had
*NL*
nothing
more
urgent
on
his
hands
than
the
newspaper
,
he
went
behind
*NL*
him
,
laid
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
,
and
said
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Father
,
will
you
come
up
into
my
sanctum
,
and
look
at
my
new
*NL*
sketches
?
I
've
arranged
them
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
getting
terrible
stiff
in
the
joints
,
Phil
,
for
climbing
those
*NL*
stairs
of
yours
,
''
said
Wakem
,
looking
kindly
at
his
son
as
he
laid
*NL*
down
his
paper
.
``
But
come
along
,
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
a
nice
place
for
you

is
n't
it

Phil
?
--
a
capital
light
that
*NL*
from
the
roof
,
eh
?
''
was
,
as
usual
,
the
first
thing
he
said
on
entering
*NL*
the
painting-room
.
He
liked
to
remind
himself
and
his
son
too
that
his
*NL*
fatherly
indulgence
had
provided
the
accommodation
.
He
had
been
a
good
*NL*
father
.
Emily
would
have
nothing
to
reproach
him
with
there
,
if
she
*NL*
came
back
again
from
her
grave
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
come
,
''
he
said
,
putting
his
double
eye-glass
over
his
nose
,
and
*NL*
seating
himself
to
take
a
general
view
while
he
rested
,
``
you
've
got
a
*NL*
famous
show
here
.
Upon
my
word
,
I
do
n't
see
that
your
things
are
n't
as
*NL*
good
as
that
London
artist
's
--
what
's
his
name
--
that
Leyburn
gave
so
*NL*
much
money
for
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Philip
shook
his
head
and
smiled
.
He
had
seated
himself
on
his
*NL*
painting-stool
,
and
had
taken
a
lead
pencil
in
his
hand
,
with
which
he
*NL*
was
making
strong
marks
to
counteract
the
sense
of
tremulousness
.
He
*NL*
watched
his
father
get
up
,
and
walk
slowly
round
,
good-naturedly
*NL*
dwelling
on
the
pictures
much
longer
than
his
amount
of
genuine
taste
*NL*
for
landscape
would
have
prompted
,
till
he
stopped
before
a
stand
on
*NL*
which
two
pictures
were
placed
,
--
one
much
larger
than
the
other
,
the
*NL*
smaller
one
in
a
leather
case
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bless
me
!
what
have
you
here
?
''
said
Wakem
,
startled
by
a
sudden
*NL*
transition
from
landscape
to
portrait
.
``
I
thought
you
'd
left
off
*NL*
figures
.
Who
are
these
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
the
same
person

said
Philip
,
with
calm
promptness
,
``
at
*NL*
different
ages
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
person
?
''
said
Wakem
,
sharply
fixing
his
eyes
with
a
growing
*NL*
look
of
suspicion
on
the
larger
picture
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Tulliver
.
The
small
one
is
something
like
what
she
was
when
I
*NL*
was
at
school
with
her
brother
at
King
's
Lorton
;
the
larger
one
is
not
*NL*
quite
so
good
a
likeness
of
what
she
was
when
I
came
from
abroad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Wakem
turned
round
fiercely
,
with
a
flushed
face
,
letting
his
*NL*
eye-glass
fall
,
and
looking
at
his
son
with
a
savage
expression
for
a
*NL*
moment
,
as
if
he
was
ready
to
strike
that
daring
feebleness
from
the
*NL*
stool
.
But
he
threw
himself
into
the
armchair
again
,
and
thrust
his
*NL*
hands
into
his
trouser-pockets
,
still
looking
angrily
at
his
son
,
*NL*
however
.
Philip
did
not
return
the
look
,
but
sat
quietly
watching
the
*NL*
point
of
his
pencil
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
do
you
mean
to
say
,
then
,
that
you
have
had
any
acquaintance

her
since
you
came
from
abroad

said
Wakem
,
at
last
,
with
that
vain
*NL*
effort
which
rage
always
makes
to
throw
as
much
punishment
as
it
*NL*
desires
to
inflict
into
words
and
tones
,
since
blows
are
forbidden
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

I
saw
a
great
deal
of
her
for
a
whole
year
before
her
father
's
*NL*
death

We
met
often
in
that
thicket
--
the
Red
Deeps
--
near
Dorlcote
*NL*
Mill
.
I
love
her
dearly
;
I
shall
never
love
any
other
woman

I
have
*NL*
thought
of
her
ever
since
she
was
a
little
girl

*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
on

And
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

I
never
told
her
I
loved

till
just
before
we
parted

she

promised
her
brother
not
to
see
me
again
or
to
correspond
with

am

heaped

said
Wakem
,
getting
white
,
and
beginning
to
tremble
*NL*
under
an
enraged
sense
of
impotence
before
Philip
's
calm
defiance
and
*NL*
concentration
of
purpose
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

Philip
,
looking
up
at
him
for
the
first
time
;
``
I
*NL*
do
n't
regard
it
as
a
return
.
You
have
been
an
indulgent
father
to
me
;
*NL*
but
I
have
always
felt
that
it
was
because
you
had
an
affectionate
*NL*
wish
to
give
me
as
much
happiness
as
my
unfortunate
lot
would
admit
,
*NL*
not
that
it
was
a
debt
you
expected
me
to
pay
by
sacrificing
all
my
*NL*
chances
of
happiness
to
satisfy
feelings
of
yours
which
I
can
never
*NL*
share
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
most
sons
would
share
their
father
's
feelings
in
this
case
,
''
*NL*
said
Wakem
,
bitterly
.
``
The
girl
's
father
was
an
ignorant
mad
brute
,
*NL*
who
was
within
an
inch
of
murdering
me
.
The
whole
town
knows
it
.
And
*NL*
the
brother
is
just
as
insolent
,
only
in
a
cooler
way
.
He
forbade
her
*NL*
seeing
you
,
you
say
;
he
'll
break
every
bone
in
your
body
,
for
your
*NL*
greater
happiness
,
if
you
do
n't
take
care
.
But
you
seem
to
have
made
*NL*
up
your
mind
;
you
have
counted
the
consequences
,
I
suppose
.
Of
course
*NL*
you
are
independent
of
me
;
you
can
marry
this
girl
to-morrow
,
if
you
*NL*
like
;
you
are
a
man
of
five-and-twenty
,
--
you
can
go
your
way
,
and
I
*NL*
can
go
mine
.
We
need
have
no
more
to
do
with
each
other
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Wakem
rose
and
walked
toward
the
door
,
but
something
held
him
back
,
*NL*
and
instead
of
leaving
the
room
,
he
walked
up
and
down
it
.
Philip
was
*NL*
slow
to
reply
,
and
when
he
spoke
,
his
tone
had
a
more
incisive
*NL*
quietness
and
clearness
than
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
I
ca
n't
marry
Miss
Tulliver
,
even
if
she
would
have
me
,
if
I
have
*NL*
only
my
own
resources
to
maintain
her
with
.
I
have
been
brought
up
to
*NL*
no
profession
.
I
ca
n't
offer
her
poverty
as
well
as
deformity
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
_
there
_
is
a
reason
for
your
clinging
to
me
,
doubtless
,
''
said
*NL*
Wakem
,
still
bitterly
,
though
Philip
's
last
words
had
given
him
a
*NL*
pang
;
they
had
stirred
a
feeling
which
had
been
a
habit
for
a
quarter
*NL*
of
a
century
.
He
threw
himself
into
the
chair
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
expected
all
this
,
''
said
Philip
.
``
I
know
these
scenes
are
often
*NL*
happening
between
father
and
son
.
If
I
were
like
other
men
of
my
age
,
*NL*
I
might
answer
your
angry
words
by
still
angrier
;
we
might
part
;
I
*NL*
should
marry
the
woman
I
love
,
and
have
a
chance
of
being
as
happy
as
*NL*
the
rest
.
But
if
it
will
be
a
satisfaction
to
you
to
annihilate
the
*NL*
very
object
of
everything
you
've
done
for
me
,
you
have
an
advantage
*NL*
over
most
fathers
;
you
can
completely
deprive
me
of
the
only
thing
*NL*
that
would
make
my
life
worth
having
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Philip
paused
,
but
his
father
was
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
best
what
satisfaction
you
would
have
,
beyond
that
of
*NL*
gratifying
a
ridiculous
rancor
worthy
only
of
wandering
savages
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ridiculous
rancor
!
''
Wakem
burst
out
.
``
What
do
you
mean
?
Damn
it
!
is
a
*NL*
man
to
be
horsewhipped
by
a
boor
and
love
him
for
it
?
Besides
,
there
's
*NL*
that
cold
,
proud
devil
of
a
son
,
who
said
a
word
to
me
I
shall
not
*NL*
forget
when
we
had
the
settling
.
He
would
be
as
pleasant
a
mark
for
a
*NL*
bullet
as
I
know
,
if
he
were
worth
the
expense
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
mean
your
resentment
toward
them
,
''
said
Philip
,
who
had
his
*NL*
reasons
for
some
sympathy
with
this
view
of
Tom
,
``
though
a
feeling
of
*NL*
revenge
is
not
worth
much
,
that
you
should
care
to
keep
it
.
I
mean
*NL*
your
extending
the
enmity
to
a
helpless
girl
,
who
has
too
much
sense
*NL*
and
goodness
to
share
their
narrow
prejudices
.
_
She
_
has
never
entered
*NL*
into
the
family
quarrels
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
does
that
signify
?
We
do
n't
ask
what
a
woman
does
;
we
ask
whom
*NL*
she
belongs
to
.
It
's
altogether
a
degrading
thing
to
you
,
to
think
of
*NL*
marrying
old
Tulliver
's
daughter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
the
first
time
in
the
dialogue
,
Philip
lost
some
of
his
*NL*
self-control
,
and
colored
with
anger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Tulliver
,
''
he
said
,
with
bitter
incisiveness
,
``
has
the
only
*NL*
grounds
of
rank
that
anything
but
vulgar
folly
can
suppose
to
belong
*NL*
to
the
middle
class
;
she
is
thoroughly
refined
,
and
her
friends
,
*NL*
whatever
else
they
may
be
,
are
respected
for
irreproachable
honor
and
*NL*
integrity
.
All
St.
Ogg
's
,
I
fancy
,
would
pronounce
her
to
be
more
than
*NL*
my
equal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Wakem
darted
a
glance
of
fierce
question
at
his
son
;
but
Philip
was
*NL*
not
looking
at
him
,
and
with
a
certain
penitent
consciousness
went
on
,
*NL*
in
a
few
moments
,
as
if
in
amplification
of
his
last
words
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Find
a
single
person
in
St.
Ogg
's
who
will
not
tell
you
that
a
*NL*
beautiful
creature
like
her
would
be
throwing
herself
away
on
a
*NL*
pitiable
object
like
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
she
!
''
said
Wakem
,
rising
again
,
and
forgetting
everything
else
in
*NL*
a
burst
of
resentful
pride
,
half
fatherly
,
half
personal
.
``
It
would
be
*NL*
a
deuced
fine
match
for
her
.
It
's
all
stuff
about
an
accidental
*NL*
deformity
,
when
a
girl
's
really
attached
to
a
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
girls
are
not
apt
to
get
attached
under
those
circumstances
,
''
*NL*
said
Philip
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
''
said
Wakem
,
rather
brutally
,
trying
to
recover
his
*NL*
previous
position
,
``
if
she
does
n't
care
for
you
,
you
might
have
spared
*NL*
yourself
the
trouble
of
talking
to
me
about
her
,
and
you
might
have
*NL*
spared
me
the
trouble
of
refusing
my
consent
to
what
was
never
likely
*NL*
to
happen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Wakem
strode
to
the
door
,
and
without
looking
round
again
,
banged
it
*NL*
after
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Philip
was
not
without
confidence
that
his
father
would
be
ultimately
*NL*
wrought
upon
as
he
had
expected
,
by
what
had
passed
;
but
the
scene
had
*NL*
jarred
upon
his
nerves
,
which
were
as
sensitive
as
a
woman
's
.
He
*NL*
determined
not
to
go
down
to
dinner
;
he
could
n't
meet
his
father
again
*NL*
that
day
.
It
was
Wakem
's
habit
,
when
he
had
no
company
at
home
,
to
go
*NL*
out
in
the
evening
,
often
as
early
as
half-past
seven
;
and
as
it
was
*NL*
far
on
in
the
afternoon
now
,
Philip
locked
up
his
room
and
went
out
*NL*
for
a
long
ramble
,
thinking
he
would
not
return
until
his
father
was
*NL*
out
of
the
house
again
.
He
got
into
a
boat
,
and
went
down
the
river
to
*NL*
a
favorite
village
,
where
he
dined
,
and
lingered
till
it
was
late
*NL*
enough
for
him
to
return
.
He
had
never
had
any
sort
of
quarrel
with
*NL*
his
father
before
,
and
had
a
sickening
fear
that
this
contest
,
just
*NL*
begun
,
might
go
on
for
weeks
;
and
what
might
not
happen
in
that
time
?
*NL*
He
would
not
allow
himself
to
define
what
that
involuntary
question
*NL*
meant
.
But
if
he
could
once
be
in
the
position
of
Maggie
's
accepted
,
*NL*
acknowledged
lover
,
there
would
be
less
room
for
vague
dread
.
He
went
*NL*
up
to
his
painting-room
again
,
and
threw
himself
with
a
sense
of
*NL*
fatigue
into
the
armchair
,
looking
round
absently
at
the
views
of
*NL*
water
and
rock
that
were
ranged
around
,
till
he
fell
into
a
doze
,
in
*NL*
which
he
fancied
Maggie
was
slipping
down
a
glistening
,
green
,
slimy
*NL*
channel
of
a
waterfall
,
and
he
was
looking
on
helpless
,
till
he
was
*NL*
awakened
by
what
seemed
a
sudden
,
awful
crash
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
opening
of
the
door
,
and
he
could
hardly
have
dozed
more
*NL*
than
a
few
moments
,
for
there
was
no
perceptible
change
in
the
evening
*NL*
light
.
It
was
his
father
who
entered
;
and
when
Philip
moved
to
vacate
*NL*
the
chair
for
him
,
he
said
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sit
still
.
I
'd
rather
walk
about
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
stalked
up
and
down
the
room
once
or
twice
,
and
then
,
standing
*NL*
opposite
Philip
with
his
hands
thrust
in
his
side
pockets
,
he
said
,
as
*NL*
if
continuing
a
conversation
that
had
not
been
broken
off
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
this
girl
seems
to
have
been
fond
of
you
,
Phil
,
else
she
would
n't
*NL*
have
met
you
in
that
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Philip
's
heart
was
beating
rapidly
,
and
a
transient
flush
passed
over
*NL*
his
face
like
a
gleam
.
It
was
not
quite
easy
to
speak
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
liked
me
at
King
's
Lorton
,
when
she
was
a
little
girl
,
because
I
*NL*
used
to
sit
with
her
brother
a
great
deal
when
he
had
hurt
his
foot
.
*NL*
She
had
kept
that
in
her
memory
,
and
thought
of
me
as
a
friend
of
a
*NL*
long
while
ago
.
She
did
n't
think
of
me
as
a
lover
when
she
met
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
but
you
made
love
to
her
at
last
.
What
did
she
say
then
?
''
said
*NL*
Wakem
,
walking
about
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
said
she
_
did
_
love
me
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Confound
it
,
then
;
what
else
do
you
want
?
Is
she
a
jilt
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
was
very
young
then
,
''
said
Philip
,
hesitatingly
.
``
I
'm
afraid
she
*NL*
hardly
knew
what
she
felt
.
I
'm
afraid
our
long
separation
,
and
the
*NL*
idea
that
events
must
always
divide
us
,
may
have
made
a
difference
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
she
's
in
the
town
.
I
've
seen
her
at
church

Have
n't
you
spoken
to
*NL*
her
since
you
came
back
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
at
Mr.
Deane
's
.
But
I
could
n't
renew
my
proposals
to
her
on
*NL*
several
grounds
.
One
obstacle
would
be
removed
if
you
would
give
your
*NL*
consent
,
--
if
you
would
be
willing
to
think
of
her
as
a
daughter-in-law
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Wakem
was
silent
a
little
while
,
pausing
before
Maggie
's
picture
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
not
the
sort
of
woman
your
mother
was
,
though
,
Phil
,
''
he
said
,
*NL*
at
last
.
``
I
saw
her
at
church
,
--
she
's
handsomer
than
this
,
--
deuced
*NL*
fine
eyes
and
fine
figure
,
I
saw
;
but
rather
dangerous
and
*NL*
unmanageable
,
eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
very
tender
and
affectionate
,
and
so
simple
,
--
without
the
airs
*NL*
and
petty
contrivances
other
women
have
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
?
''
said
Wakem
.
Then
looking
round
at
his
son
,
``
But
your
mother
*NL*
looked
gentler
;
she
had
that
brown
wavy
hair
and
gray
eyes
,
like
*NL*
yours
.
You
ca
n't
remember
her
very
well
.
It
was
a
thousand
pities
I
'd
*NL*
no
likeness
of
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
should
n't
you
be
glad
for
me
to
have
the
same
sort
of
*NL*
happiness
,
father
,
to
sweeten
my
life
for
me
?
There
can
never
be
*NL*
another
tie
so
strong
to
you
as
that
which
began
eight-and-twenty
*NL*
years
ago
,
when
you
married
my
mother
,
and
you
have
been
tightening
it
*NL*
ever
since

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
Phil
,
you
're
the
only
fellow
that
knows
the
best
of
me
,
''
said
*NL*
Wakem
,
giving
his
hand
to
his
son
.
``
We
must
keep
together
if
we
can
.
*NL*
And
now
,
what
am
I
to
do
?
You
must
come
downstairs
and
tell
me
.
Am
I
*NL*
to
go
and
call
on
this
dark-eyed
damsel
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
barrier
once
thrown
down
in
this
way
,
Philip
could
talk
freely
to
*NL*
his
father
of
their
entire
relation
with
the
Tullivers
,
--
of
the
desire
*NL*
to
get
the
mill
and
land
back
into
the
family
,
and
of
its
transfer
to
*NL*
Guest
&
Co.
as
an
intermediate
step
.
He
could
venture
now
to
be
*NL*
persuasive
and
urgent
,
and
his
father
yielded
with
more
readiness
than
*NL*
he
had
calculated
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
I
_
do
n't
care
about
the
mill
,
''
he
said
at
last
,
with
a
sort
of
angry
*NL*
compliance
.
``
I
've
had
an
infernal
deal
of
bother
lately
about
the
*NL*
mill
.
Let
them
pay
me
for
my
improvements
,
that
's
all
.
But
there
's
one
*NL*
thing
you
need
n't
ask
me
.
I
shall
have
no
direct
transactions
with
*NL*
young
Tulliver
.
If
you
like
to
swallow
him
for
his
sister
's
sake
,
you
*NL*
may
;
but
I
've
no
sauce
that
will
make
him
go
down
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
leave
you
to
imagine
the
agreeable
feelings
with
which
Philip
went
*NL*
to
Mr.
Deane
the
next
day
,
to
say
that
Mr.
Wakem
was
ready
to
open
the
*NL*
negotiations
,
and
Lucy
's
pretty
triumph
as
she
appealed
to
her
father
*NL*
whether
she
had
not
proved
her
great
business
abilities
.
Mr.
Deane
was
*NL*
rather
puzzled
,
and
suspected
that
there
had
been
something
``
going
on
''
*NL*
among
the
young
people
to
which
he
wanted
a
clew
.
But
to
men
of
Mr.
*NL*
Deane
's
stamp
,
what
goes
on
among
the
young
people
is
as
extraneous
to
*NL*
the
real
business
of
life
as
what
goes
on
among
the
birds
and
*NL*
butterflies
,
until
it
can
be
shown
to
have
a
malign
bearing
on
*NL*
monetary
affairs
.
And
in
this
case
the
bearing
appeared
to
be
entirely
*NL*
propitious
.

Chapter
IX
*NL*
*NL*
Charity
in
Full-Dress
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
culmination
of
Maggie
's
career
as
an
admired
member
of
society
in
*NL*
St.
Ogg
's
was
certainly
the
day
of
the
bazaar
,
when
her
simple
noble
*NL*
beauty
,
clad
in
a
white
muslin
of
some
soft-floating
kind
,
which
I
*NL*
suspect
must
have
come
from
the
stores
of
aunt
Pullet
's
wardrobe
,
*NL*
appeared
with
marked
distinction
among
the
more
adorned
and
*NL*
conventional
women
around
her
.
We
perhaps
never
detect
how
much
of
our
*NL*
social
demeanor
is
made
up
of
artificial
airs
until
we
see
a
person
*NL*
who
is
at
once
beautiful
and
simple
;
without
the
beauty
,
we
are
apt
to
*NL*
call
simplicity
awkwardness
.
The
Miss
Guests
were
much
too
well-bred
*NL*
to
have
any
of
the
grimaces
and
affected
tones
that
belong
to
*NL*
pretentious
vulgarity
;
but
their
stall
being
next
to
the
one
where
*NL*
Maggie
sat
,
it
seemed
newly
obvious
to-day
that
Miss
Guest
held
her
*NL*
chin
too
high
,
and
that
Miss
Laura
spoke
and
moved
continually
with
a
*NL*
view
to
effect
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
well-dressed
St.
Ogg
's
and
its
neighborhood
were
there
;
and
it
*NL*
would
have
been
worth
while
to
come
even
from
a
distance
,
to
see
the
*NL*
fine
old
hall
,
with
its
open
roof
and
carved
oaken
rafters
,
and
great
*NL*
oaken
folding-doors
,
and
light
shed
down
from
a
height
on
the
*NL*
many-colored
show
beneath
;
a
very
quaint
place
,
with
broad
faded
*NL*
stripes
painted
on
the
walls
,
and
here
and
there
a
show
of
heraldic
*NL*
animals
of
a
bristly
,
long-snouted
character
,
the
cherished
emblems
of
*NL*
a
noble
family
once
the
seigniors
of
this
now
civic
hall
.
A
grand
*NL*
arch
,
cut
in
the
upper
wall
at
one
end
,
surmounted
an
oaken
orchestra
,
*NL*
with
an
open
room
behind
it
,
where
hothouse
plants
and
stalls
for
*NL*
refreshments
were
disposed
;
an
agreeable
resort
for
gentlemen
disposed
*NL*
to
loiter
,
and
yet
to
exchange
the
occasional
crush
down
below
for
a
*NL*
more
commodious
point
of
view
.
In
fact
,
the
perfect
fitness
of
this
*NL*
ancient
building
for
an
admirable
modern
purpose
,
that
made
charity
*NL*
truly
elegant
,
and
led
through
vanity
up
to
the
supply
of
a
deficit
,
*NL*
was
so
striking
that
hardly
a
person
entered
the
room
without
*NL*
exchanging
the
remark
more
than
once
.
Near
the
great
arch
over
the
*NL*
orchestra
was
the
stone
oriel
with
painted
glass
,
which
was
one
of
the
*NL*
venerable
inconsistencies
of
the
old
hall
;
and
it
was
close
by
this
*NL*
that
Lucy
had
her
stall
,
for
the
convenience
of
certain
large
plain
*NL*
articles
which
she
had
taken
charge
of
for
Mrs.
Kenn
.
Maggie
had
*NL*
begged
to
sit
at
the
open
end
of
the
stall
,
and
to
have
the
sale
of
*NL*
these
articles
rather
than
of
bead-mats
and
other
elaborate
products
*NL*
of
which
she
had
but
a
dim
understanding
.
But
it
soon
appeared
that
*NL*
the
gentlemen
's
dressing-gowns
,
which
were
among
her
commodities
,
were
*NL*
objects
of
such
general
attention
and
inquiry
,
and
excited
so
*NL*
troublesome
a
curiosity
as
to
their
lining
and
comparative
merits
,
*NL*
together
with
a
determination
to
test
them
by
trying
on
,
as
to
make
*NL*
her
post
a
very
conspicuous
one
.
The
ladies
who
had
commodities
of
*NL*
their
own
to
sell
,
and
did
not
want
dressing-gowns
,
saw
at
once
the
*NL*
frivolity
and
bad
taste
of
this
masculine
preference
for
goods
which
*NL*
any
tailor
could
furnish
;
and
it
is
possible
that
the
emphatic
notice
*NL*
of
various
kinds
which
was
drawn
toward
Miss
Tulliver
on
this
public
*NL*
occasion
,
threw
a
very
strong
and
unmistakable
light
on
her
subsequent
*NL*
conduct
in
many
minds
then
present
.
Not
that
anger
,
on
account
of
*NL*
spurned
beauty
can
dwell
in
the
celestial
breasts
of
charitable
*NL*
ladies
,
but
rather
that
the
errors
of
persons
who
have
once
been
much
*NL*
admired
necessarily
take
a
deeper
tinge
from
the
mere
force
of
*NL*
contrast
;
and
also
,
that
to-day
Maggie
's
conspicuous
position
,
for
the
*NL*
first
time
,
made
evident
certain
characteristics
which
were
*NL*
subsequently
felt
to
have
an
explanatory
bearing
.
There
was
something
*NL*
rather
bold
in
Miss
Tulliver
's
direct
gaze
,
and
something
undefinably
*NL*
coarse
in
the
style
of
her
beauty
,
which
placed
her
,
in
the
opinion
of
*NL*
all
feminine
judges
,
far
below
her
cousin
Miss
Deane
;
for
the
ladies
*NL*
of
St.
Ogg
's
had
now
completely
ceded
to
Lucy
their
hypothetic
claims
*NL*
on
the
admiration
of
Mr.
Stephen
Guest
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
dear
little
Lucy
herself
,
her
late
benevolent
triumph
about
the
*NL*
Mill
,
and
all
the
affectionate
projects
she
was
cherishing
for
Maggie
*NL*
and
Philip
,
helped
to
give
her
the
highest
spirits
to-day
,
and
she
*NL*
felt
nothing
but
pleasure
in
the
evidence
of
Maggie
's
attractiveness
.
*NL*
It
is
true
,
she
was
looking
very
charming
herself
,
and
Stephen
was
*NL*
paying
her
the
utmost
attention
on
this
public
occasion
;
jealously
*NL*
buying
up
the
articles
he
had
seen
under
her
fingers
in
the
process
of
*NL*
making
,
and
gayly
helping
her
to
cajole
the
male
customers
into
the
*NL*
purchase
of
the
most
effeminate
futilities
.
He
chose
to
lay
aside
his
*NL*
hat
and
wear
a
scarlet
fez
of
her
embroidering
;
but
by
superficial
*NL*
observers
this
was
necessarily
liable
to
be
interpreted
less
as
a
*NL*
compliment
to
Lucy
than
as
a
mark
of
coxcombry
.
``
Guest
is
a
great
*NL*
coxcomb
,
''
young
Torry
observed
;
``
but
then
he
is
a
privileged
person
in
*NL*
St.
Ogg
's
--
he
carries
all
before
him
;
if
another
fellow
did
such
*NL*
things
,
everybody
would
say
he
made
a
fool
of
himself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Stephen
purchased
absolutely
nothing
from
Maggie
,
until
Lucy
said
,
*NL*
in
rather
a
vexed
undertone
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
See
,
now
;
all
the
things
of
Maggie
's
knitting
will
be
gone
,
and
you
*NL*
will
not
have
bought
one
.
There
are
those
deliciously
soft
warm
things
*NL*
for
the
wrists
,
--
do
buy
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
,
''
said
Stephen
,
``
they
must
be
intended
for
imaginative
persons
,
*NL*
who
can
chill
themselves
on
this
warm
day
by
thinking
of
the
frosty
*NL*
Caucasus
.
Stern
reason
is
my
forte
,
you
know
.
You
must
get
Philip
to
*NL*
buy
those
.
By
the
way
,
why
does
n't
he
come
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
never
likes
going
where
there
are
many
people
,
though
I
enjoined
*NL*
him
to
come
.
He
said
he
would
buy
up
any
of
my
goods
that
the
rest
of
*NL*
the
world
rejected
.
But
now
,
do
go
and
buy
something
of
Maggie
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
;
see
,
she
has
got
a
customer
;
there
is
old
Wakem
himself
just
*NL*
coming
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
's
eyes
turned
with
anxious
interest
toward
Maggie
to
see
how
she
*NL*
went
through
this
first
interview
,
since
a
sadly
memorable
time
,
with
*NL*
a
man
toward
whom
she
must
have
so
strange
a
mixture
of
feelings
;
but
*NL*
she
was
pleased
to
notice
that
Wakem
had
tact
enough
to
enter
at
once
*NL*
into
talk
about
the
bazaar
wares
,
and
appear
interested
in
purchasing
,
*NL*
smiling
now
and
then
kindly
at
Maggie
,
and
not
calling
on
her
to
speak
*NL*
much
,
as
if
he
observed
that
she
was
rather
pale
and
tremulous
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
Wakem
is
making
himself
particularly
amiable
to
your
cousin
,
''
*NL*
said
Stephen
,
in
an
undertone
to
Lucy
;
``
is
it
pure
magnanimity
?
You
*NL*
talked
of
a
family
quarrel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
that
will
soon
be
quite
healed
,
I
hope
,
''
said
Lucy
,
becoming
a
*NL*
little
indiscreet
in
her
satisfaction
,
and
speaking
with
an
air
of
*NL*
significance
.
But
Stephen
did
not
appear
to
notice
this
,
and
as
some
*NL*
lady-purchasers
came
up
,
he
lounged
on
toward
Maggie
's
end
,
handling
*NL*
trifles
and
standing
aloof
until
Wakem
,
who
had
taken
out
his
purse
,
*NL*
had
finished
his
transactions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
son
came
with
me
,
''
he
overheard
Wakem
saying
,
``
but
he
has
vanished
*NL*
into
some
other
part
of
the
building
,
and
has
left
all
these
*NL*
charitable
gallantries
to
me
.
I
hope
you
'll
reproach
him
for
his
*NL*
shabby
conduct
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
returned
his
smile
and
bow
without
speaking
,
and
he
turned
away
,
*NL*
only
then
observing
Stephen
and
nodding
to
him
.
Maggie
,
conscious
that
*NL*
Stephen
was
still
there
,
busied
herself
with
counting
money
,
and
*NL*
avoided
looking
up
.
She
had
been
well
pleased
that
he
had
devoted
*NL*
himself
to
Lucy
to-day
,
and
had
not
come
near
her
.
They
had
begun
the
*NL*
morning
with
an
indifferent
salutation
,
and
both
had
rejoiced
in
being
*NL*
aloof
from
each
other
,
like
a
patient
who
has
actually
done
without
*NL*
his
opium
,
in
spite
of
former
failures
in
resolution
.
And
during
the
*NL*
last
few
days
they
had
even
been
making
up
their
minds
to
failures
,
*NL*
looking
to
the
outward
events
that
must
soon
come
to
separate
them
,
as
*NL*
a
reason
for
dispensing
with
self-conquest
in
detail
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
moved
step
by
step
as
if
he
were
being
unwillingly
dragged
,
*NL*
until
he
had
got
round
the
open
end
of
the
stall
,
and
was
half
hidden
*NL*
by
a
screen
of
draperies
.
Maggie
went
on
counting
her
money
till
she
*NL*
suddenly
heard
a
deep
gentle
voice
saying
,
``
Are
n't
you
very
tried
?
Do
*NL*
let
me
bring
you
something
,
--
some
fruit
or
jelly
,
may
n't
I
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
unexpected
tones
shook
her
like
a
sudden
accidental
vibration
of
a
*NL*
harp
close
by
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
,
thank
you
,
''
she
said
faintly
,
and
only
half
looking
up
for
an
*NL*
instant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
look
so
pale
,
''
Stephen
insisted
,
in
a
more
entreating
tone
.
``
I
'm
*NL*
sure
you
're
exhausted
.
I
must
disobey
you
,
and
bring
something
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
indeed
,
I
could
n't
take
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
angry
with
me
?
What
have
I
done
?
_
Do
_
look
at
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pray
,
go
away
,
''
said
Maggie
,
looking
at
him
helplessly
,
her
eyes
*NL*
glancing
immediately
from
him
to
the
opposite
corner
of
the
orchestra
,
*NL*
which
was
half
hidden
by
the
folds
of
the
old
faded
green
curtain
.
*NL*
Maggie
had
no
sooner
uttered
this
entreaty
than
she
was
wretched
at
*NL*
the
admission
it
implied
;
but
Stephen
turned
away
at
once
,
and
*NL*
following
her
upward
glance
,
he
saw
Philip
Wakem
sealed
in
the
*NL*
half-hidden
corner
,
so
that
he
could
command
little
more
than
that
*NL*
angle
of
the
hall
in
which
Maggie
sat
.
An
entirely
new
though
occurred
*NL*
to
Stephen
,
and
linking
itself
with
what
he
had
observed
of
Wakem
's
*NL*
manner
,
and
with
Lucy
's
reply
to
his
observation
,
it
convinced
him
*NL*
that
there
had
been
some
former
relation
between
Philip
and
Maggie
*NL*
beyond
that
childish
one
of
which
he
had
heard
.
More
than
one
impulse
*NL*
made
him
immediately
leave
the
hall
and
go
upstairs
to
the
*NL*
refreshment-room
,
where
,
walking
up
to
Philip
,
he
sat
down
behind
him
,
*NL*
and
put
his
hand
on
his
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
studying
for
a
portrait
,
Phil
,
''
he
said
,
``
or
for
a
sketch
of
*NL*
that
oriel
window
?
By
George
,
it
makes
a
capital
bit
from
this
dark
*NL*
corner
,
with
the
curtain
just
marking
it
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
been
studying
expression
,
''
said
Philip
,
curtly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
Miss
Tulliver
's
?
It
's
rather
of
the
savage-moody
order
to-day
,
*NL*
I
think
,
--
something
of
the
fallen
princess
serving
behind
a
counter
.
*NL*
Her
cousin
sent
me
to
her
with
a
civil
offer
to
get
her
some
*NL*
refreshment
,
but
I
have
been
snubbed
,
as
usual
.
There
's
natural
*NL*
antipathy
between
us
,
I
suppose
;
I
have
seldom
the
honor
to
please
*NL*
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
hypocrite
you
are
!
''
said
Philip
,
flushing
angrily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
because
experience
must
have
told
me
that
I
'm
universally
*NL*
pleasing
?
I
admit
the
law
,
but
there
's
some
disturbing
force
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
going
,
''
said
Philip
,
rising
abruptly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
am
I
--
to
get
a
breath
of
fresh
air
;
this
place
gets
oppressive
.
I
*NL*
think
I
have
done
suit
and
service
long
enough
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
friends
walked
downstairs
together
without
speaking
.
Philip
*NL*
turned
through
the
outer
door
into
the
court-yard
;
but
Stephen
,
*NL*
saying
,
``
Oh
,
by
the
by
,
I
must
call
in
here
,
''
went
on
along
the
*NL*
passage
to
one
of
the
rooms
at
the
other
end
of
the
building
,
which
*NL*
were
appropriated
to
the
town
library
.
He
had
the
room
all
to
himself
,
*NL*
and
a
man
requires
nothing
less
than
this
when
he
wants
to
dash
his
*NL*
cap
on
the
table
,
throw
himself
astride
a
chair
,
and
stare
at
a
high
*NL*
brick
wall
with
a
frown
which
would
not
have
been
beneath
the
occasion
*NL*
if
he
had
been
slaying
``
the
giant
Python
.
''
The
conduct
that
issues
*NL*
from
a
moral
conflict
has
often
so
close
a
resemblance
to
vice
that
*NL*
the
distinction
escapes
all
outward
judgments
founded
on
a
mere
*NL*
comparison
of
actions
.
It
is
clear
to
you
,
I
hope
,
that
Stephen
was
*NL*
not
a
hypocrite
,
--
capable
of
deliberate
doubleness
for
a
selfish
end
;
*NL*
and
yet
his
fluctuations
between
the
indulgence
of
a
feeling
and
the
*NL*
systematic
concealment
of
it
might
have
made
a
good
case
in
support
of
*NL*
Philip
's
accusation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
Maggie
sat
at
her
stall
cold
and
trembling
,
with
that
*NL*
painful
sensation
in
the
eyes
which
comes
from
resolutely
repressed
*NL*
tears
.
Was
her
life
to
be
always
like
this
,
--
always
bringing
some
new
*NL*
source
of
inward
strife
?
She
heard
confusedly
the
busy
,
indifferent
*NL*
voices
around
her
,
and
wished
her
mind
could
flow
into
that
easy
*NL*
babbling
current
.
It
was
at
this
moment
that
Dr.
Kenn
,
who
had
quite
*NL*
lately
come
into
the
hall
,
and
was
now
walking
down
the
middle
with
*NL*
his
hands
behind
him
,
taking
a
general
view
,
fixed
his
eyes
on
Maggie
*NL*
for
the
first
time
,
and
was
struck
with
the
expression
of
pain
on
her
*NL*
beautiful
face
.
She
was
sitting
quite
still
,
for
the
stream
of
*NL*
customers
had
lessened
at
this
late
hour
in
the
afternoon
;
the
*NL*
gentlemen
had
chiefly
chosen
the
middle
of
the
day
,
and
Maggie
's
stall
*NL*
was
looking
rather
bare
.
This
,
with
her
absent
,
pained
expression
,
*NL*
finished
the
contrast
between
her
and
her
companions
,
who
were
all
*NL*
bright
,
eager
,
and
busy
.
He
was
strongly
arrested
.
Her
face
had
*NL*
naturally
drawn
his
attention
as
a
new
and
striking
one
at
church
,
and
*NL*
he
had
been
introduced
to
her
during
a
short
call
on
business
at
Mr.
*NL*
Deane
's
,
but
he
had
never
spoken
more
than
three
words
to
her
.
He
*NL*
walked
toward
her
now
,
and
Maggie
,
perceiving
some
one
approaching
,
*NL*
roused
herself
to
look
up
and
be
prepared
to
speak
.
She
felt
a
*NL*
childlike
,
instinctive
relief
from
the
sense
of
uneasiness
in
this
*NL*
exertion
,
when
she
saw
it
was
Dr.
Kenn
's
face
that
was
looking
at
her
;
*NL*
that
plain
,
middle-aged
face
,
with
a
grave
,
penetrating
kindness
in
*NL*
it
,
seeming
to
tell
of
a
human
being
who
had
reached
a
firm
,
safe
*NL*
strand
,
but
was
looking
with
helpful
pity
toward
the
strugglers
still
*NL*
tossed
by
the
waves
,
had
an
effect
on
Maggie
at
this
moment
which
was
*NL*
afterward
remembered
by
her
as
if
it
had
been
a
promise
.
The
*NL*
middle-aged
,
who
have
lived
through
their
strongest
emotions
,
but
are
*NL*
yet
in
the
time
when
memory
is
still
half
passionate
and
not
merely
*NL*
contemplative
,
should
surely
be
a
sort
of
natural
priesthood
,
whom
*NL*
life
has
disciplined
and
consecrated
to
be
the
refuge
and
rescue
of
*NL*
early
stumblers
and
victims
of
self-despair
.
Most
of
us
,
at
some
*NL*
moment
in
our
young
lives
,
would
have
welcomed
a
priest
of
that
*NL*
natural
order
in
any
sort
of
canonicals
or
uncanonicals
,
but
had
to
*NL*
scramble
upward
into
all
the
difficulties
of
nineteen
entirely
without
*NL*
such
aid
,
as
Maggie
did
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
find
your
office
rather
a
fatiguing
one
,
I
fear
,
Miss
Tulliver
,
''
*NL*
said
Dr.
Kenn
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
,
rather
,
''
said
Maggie
,
simply
,
not
being
accustomed
to
simpler
*NL*
amiable
denials
of
obvious
facts
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
can
tell
Mrs.
Kenn
that
you
have
disposed
of
her
goods
very
*NL*
quickly
,
''
he
added
;
``
she
will
be
very
much
obliged
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
have
done
nothing
;
the
gentlemen
came
very
fast
to
buy
the
*NL*
dressing-gowns
and
embroidered
waistcoats
,
but
I
think
any
of
the
*NL*
other
ladies
would
have
sold
more
;
I
did
n't
know
what
to
say
about
*NL*
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dr.
Kenn
smiled
.
``
I
hope
I
'm
going
to
have
you
as
a
permanent
*NL*
parishioner
now
,
Miss
Tulliver
;
am
I
?
You
have
been
at
a
distance
from
*NL*
us
hitherto
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
been
a
teacher
in
a
school
,
and
I
'm
going
into
another
*NL*
situation
of
the
same
kind
very
soon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
?
I
was
hoping
you
would
remain
among
your
friends
,
who
are
all
in
*NL*
this
neighborhood
,
I
believe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
_
I
must
go
_
,
''
said
Maggie
,
earnestly
,
looking
at
Dr.
Kenn
with
an
*NL*
expression
of
reliance
,
as
if
she
had
told
him
her
history
in
those
*NL*
three
words
.
It
was
one
of
those
moments
of
implicit
revelation
which
*NL*
will
sometimes
happen
even
between
people
who
meet
quite
*NL*
transiently
,
--
on
a
mile
's
journey
,
perhaps
,
or
when
resting
by
the
*NL*
wayside
.
There
is
always
this
possibility
of
a
word
or
look
from
a
*NL*
stranger
to
keep
alive
the
sense
of
human
brotherhood
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dr.
Kenn
's
ear
and
eye
took
in
all
the
signs
that
this
brief
*NL*
confidence
of
Maggie
's
was
charged
with
meaning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
understand
,
''
he
said
;
``
you
feel
it
right
to
go
.
But
that
will
not
*NL*
prevent
our
meeting
again
,
I
hope
;
it
will
not
prevent
my
knowing
you
*NL*
better
,
if
I
can
be
of
any
service
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
put
out
his
hand
and
pressed
hers
kindly
before
he
turned
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
has
some
trouble
or
other
at
heart
,
''
he
thought
.
``
Poor
child
!
she
*NL*
looks
as
if
she
might
turn
out
to
be
one
of
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
souls
by
nature
pitched
too
high
,
*NL*
By
suffering
plunged
too
low
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
something
wonderfully
honest
in
those
beautiful
eyes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
may
be
surprising
that
Maggie
,
among
whose
many
imperfections
an
*NL*
excessive
delight
in
admiration
and
acknowledged
supremacy
were
not
*NL*
absent
now
,
any
more
than
when
she
was
instructing
the
gypsies
with
a
*NL*
view
toward
achieving
a
royal
position
among
them
,
was
not
more
elated
*NL*
on
a
day
when
she
had
had
the
tribute
of
so
many
looks
and
smiles
,
*NL*
together
with
that
satisfactory
consciousness
which
had
necessarily
*NL*
come
from
being
taken
before
Lucy
's
chevalglass
,
and
made
to
look
at
*NL*
the
full
length
of
her
tall
beauty
,
crowned
by
the
night
of
her
massy
*NL*
hair
.
Maggie
had
smiled
at
herself
then
,
and
for
the
moment
had
*NL*
forgotten
everything
in
the
sense
of
her
own
beauty
.
If
that
state
of
*NL*
mind
could
have
lasted
,
her
choice
would
have
been
to
have
Stephen
*NL*
Guest
at
her
feet
,
offering
her
a
life
filled
with
all
luxuries
,
with
*NL*
daily
incense
of
adoration
near
and
distant
,
and
with
all
*NL*
possibilities
of
culture
at
her
command
.
But
there
were
things
in
her
*NL*
stronger
than
vanity
,
--
passion
and
affection
,
and
long
,
deep
memories
*NL*
of
early
discipline
and
effort
,
of
early
claims
on
her
love
and
pity
;
*NL*
and
the
stream
of
vanity
was
soon
swept
along
and
mingled
*NL*
imperceptibly
with
that
wider
current
which
was
at
its
highest
force
*NL*
today
,
under
the
double
urgency
of
the
events
and
inward
impulses
*NL*
brought
by
the
last
week
.
*NL*
*NL*
Philip
had
not
spoken
to
her
himself
about
the
removal
of
obstacles
*NL*
between
them
on
his
father
's
side
,
--
he
shrank
from
that
;
but
he
had
*NL*
told
everything
to
Lucy
,
with
the
hope
that
Maggie
,
being
informed
*NL*
through
her
,
might
give
him
some
encouraging
sign
that
their
being
*NL*
brought
thus
much
nearer
to
each
other
was
a
happiness
to
her
.
The
*NL*
rush
of
conflicting
feelings
was
too
great
for
Maggie
to
say
much
when
*NL*
Lucy
,
with
a
face
breathing
playful
joy
,
like
one
of
Correggio
's
*NL*
cherubs
,
poured
forth
her
triumphant
revelation
;
and
Lucy
could
hardly
*NL*
be
surprised
that
she
could
do
little
more
than
cry
with
gladness
at
*NL*
the
thought
of
her
father
's
wish
being
fulfilled
,
and
of
Tom
's
getting
*NL*
the
Mill
again
in
reward
for
all
his
hard
striving
.
The
details
of
*NL*
preparation
for
the
bazaar
had
then
come
to
usurp
Lucy
's
attention
for
*NL*
the
next
few
days
,
and
nothing
had
been
said
by
the
cousins
on
*NL*
subjects
that
were
likely
to
rouse
deeper
feelings
.
Philip
had
been
to
*NL*
the
house
more
than
once
,
but
Maggie
had
had
no
private
conversation
*NL*
with
him
,
and
thus
she
had
been
left
to
fight
her
inward
battle
*NL*
without
interference
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
when
the
bazaar
was
fairly
ended
,
and
the
cousins
were
alone
*NL*
again
,
resting
together
at
home
,
Lucy
said
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
give
up
going
to
stay
with
your
aunt
Moss
the
day
after
*NL*
to-morrow
,
Maggie
;
write
a
note
to
her
,
and
tell
her
you
have
put
it
*NL*
off
at
my
request
,
and
I
'll
send
the
man
with
it
.
She
wo
n't
be
*NL*
displeased
;
you
'll
have
plenty
of
time
to
go
by-and-by
;
and
I
do
n't
*NL*
want
you
to
go
out
of
the
way
just
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
indeed
I
must
go
,
dear
;
I
ca
n't
put
it
off
.
I
would
n't
leave
*NL*
aunt
Gritty
out
for
the
world
.
And
I
shall
have
very
little
time
,
for
*NL*
I
'm
going
away
to
a
new
situation
on
the
25th
of
June
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Maggie
!
''
said
Lucy
,
almost
white
with
astonishment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
tell
you
,
dear
,
''
said
Maggie
,
making
a
great
effort
to
*NL*
command
herself
,
``
because
you
've
been
so
busy
.
But
some
time
ago
I
*NL*
wrote
to
our
old
governess
,
Miss
Firniss
,
to
ask
her
to
let
me
know
if
*NL*
she
met
with
any
situation
that
I
could
fill
,
and
the
other
day
I
had
*NL*
a
letter
from
her
telling
me
that
I
could
take
three
orphan
pupils
of
*NL*
hers
to
the
coast
during
the
holidays
,
and
then
make
trial
of
a
*NL*
situation
with
her
as
teacher
.
I
wrote
yesterday
to
accept
the
offer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
felt
so
hurt
that
for
some
moments
she
was
unable
to
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Maggie
,
''
she
said
at
last
,
``
how
could
you
be
so
unkind
to
me
--
not
to
*NL*
tell
me

to
take
_
such
_
a
step

and
now
!
''
She
hesitated
a
little
,
and
*NL*
then
added
,
``
And
Philip
?
I
thought
everything
was
going
to
be
so
*NL*
happy

Oh
,
Maggie
,
what
is
the
reason
?
Give
it
up
;
let
me
write

There
*NL*
is
nothing
now

keep
you

Philip
apart

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Maggie
,
faintly
.
``
There
is
Tom
's
feeling
.
He
said
I
must
*NL*
give
him
up
if
I
married
Philip

I
know
he
will
not
change
--
at
*NL*
least
not
for
a
long
while
--
unless
something
happened
to
soften
him

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
will
talk
to
him
;
he
's
coming
back
this
week

And
this
good
*NL*
news
about
the
Mill
will
soften
him

And
I
'll
talk
to
him
about

Tom

always
very
compliant

so

obstinate

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
must
go

''
said
Maggie
,
in
a
distressed
voice
.
``
I
must
leave
*NL*
some
time
to
pack

Do
n't
press
me
to
stay

Lucy

''
*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
was
silent
for
two
or
three
minutes
,
looking
away
and
ruminating
.
*NL*
At
length
she
knelt
down
by
her
cousin
,
and
looking
up
in
her
face
*NL*
with
anxious
seriousness
,
said
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Maggie
,
is
it
that
you
do

love
Philip
well
enough
to
marry
him
?
*NL*
Tell
me

trust
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
held
Lucy
's
hands
tightly
in
silence
a
little
while
.
Her
own
*NL*
hands
were
quite
cold
.
But
when
she
spoke
,
her
voice
was
quite
clear
*NL*
and
distinct
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

Lucy

I
would
choose
to
marry
him

I
think
it
would
be
the
best

lot
for
me
,

to
make
his
life
happy

He
loved
me
first

No
*NL*
one
else
could
be
quite
what
he
is

But
I
ca
n't
divide
myself

n't
speak

to
me
again
about
it

*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
obeyed
in
pain
and
wonder
.
The
next
word
she
said
was
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
dear
Maggie
,
at
least
you
will
go
to
the
dance
at

to-morrow

have
some
music

brightness

Chapter

*NL*
The
Spell
Seems
Broken
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
suite
of
rooms
opening
into
each
other
at
Park
House
looked
duly
*NL*
brilliant
with
lights
and
flowers
and
the
personal
splendors
of
*NL*
sixteen
couples
,
with
attendant
parents
and
guardians
.
The
focus
of
*NL*
brilliancy
was
the
long
drawing-room
,
where
the
dancing
went
forward
,
*NL*
under
the
inspiration
of
the
grand
piano
;
the
library
,
into
which
it
*NL*
opened
at
one
end
,
had
the
more
sober
illumination
of
maturity
,
with
*NL*
caps
and
cards
;
and
at
the
other
end
the
pretty
sitting-room
,
with
a
*NL*
conservatory
attached
,
was
left
as
an
occasional
cool
retreat
.
Lucy
,
*NL*
who
had
laid
aside
her
black
for
the
first
time
,
and
had
her
pretty
*NL*
slimness
set
off
by
an
abundant
dress
of
white
crape
,
was
the
*NL*
acknowledged
queen
of
the
occasion
;
for
this
was
one
of
the
Miss
*NL*
Guests
'
thoroughly
condescending
parties
,
including
no
member
of
any
*NL*
aristocracy
higher
than
that
of
St.
Ogg
's
,
and
stretching
to
the
*NL*
extreme
limits
of
commercial
and
professional
gentility
.
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
at
first
refused
to
dance
,
saying
that
she
had
forgotten
all
*NL*
the
figures
--
it
was
so
many
years
since
she
had
danced
at
school
;
and
*NL*
she
was
glad
to
have
that
excuse
,
for
it
is
ill
dancing
with
a
heavy
*NL*
heart
.
But
at
length
the
music
wrought
in
her
young
limbs
,
and
the
*NL*
longing
came
;
even
though
it
was
the
horrible
young
Torry
,
who
walked
*NL*
up
a
second
time
to
try
and
persuade
her
.
She
warned
him
that
she
*NL*
could
not
dance
anything
but
a
country-dance
;
but
he
,
of
course
,
was
*NL*
willing
to
wait
for
that
high
felicity
,
meaning
only
to
be
*NL*
complimentary
when
he
assured
her
at
several
intervals
that
it
was
a
*NL*
``
great
bore
''
that
she
could
n't
waltz
,
he
would
have
liked
so
much
to
*NL*
waltz
with
her
.
But
at
last
it
was
the
turn
of
the
good
old-fashioned
*NL*
dance
which
has
the
least
of
vanity
and
the
most
of
merriment
in
it
,
*NL*
and
Maggie
quite
forgot
her
troublous
life
in
a
childlike
enjoyment
of
*NL*
that
half-rustic
rhythm
which
seems
to
banish
pretentious
etiquette
.
*NL*
She
felt
quite
charitably
toward
young
Torry
,
as
his
hand
bore
her
*NL*
along
and
held
her
up
in
the
dance
;
her
eyes
and
cheeks
had
that
fire
*NL*
of
young
joy
in
them
which
will
flame
out
if
it
can
find
the
least
*NL*
breath
to
fan
it
;
and
her
simple
black
dress
,
with
its
bit
of
black
*NL*
lace
,
seemed
like
the
dim
setting
of
a
jewel
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
had
not
yet
asked
her
to
dance
;
had
not
yet
paid
her
more
than
*NL*
a
passing
civility
.
Since
yesterday
,
that
inward
vision
of
her
which
*NL*
perpetually
made
part
of
his
consciousness
,
had
been
half
screened
by
*NL*
the
image
of
Philip
Wakem
,
which
came
across
it
like
a
blot
;
there
was
*NL*
some
attachment
between
her
and
Philip
;
at
least
there
was
an
*NL*
attachment
on
his
side
,
which
made
her
feel
in
some
bondage
.
Here
,
*NL*
then
,
Stephen
told
himself
,
was
another
claim
of
honor
which
called
on
*NL*
him
to
resist
the
attraction
that
was
continually
threatening
to
*NL*
overpower
him
.
He
told
himself
so
;
and
yet
he
had
once
or
twice
felt
a
*NL*
certain
savage
resistance
,
and
at
another
moment
a
shuddering
*NL*
repugnance
,
to
this
intrusion
of
Philip
's
image
,
which
almost
made
it
*NL*
a
new
incitement
to
rush
toward
Maggie
and
claim
her
for
himself
.
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
he
had
done
what
he
meant
to
do
this
evening
,
--
he
had
*NL*
kept
aloof
from
her
;
he
had
hardly
looked
at
her
;
and
he
had
been
*NL*
gayly
assiduous
to
Lucy
.
But
now
his
eyes
were
devouring
Maggie
;
he
*NL*
felt
inclined
to
kick
young
Torry
out
of
the
dance
,
and
take
his
*NL*
place
.
Then
he
wanted
the
dance
to
end
that
he
might
get
rid
of
his
*NL*
partner
.
The
possibility
that
he
too
should
dance
with
Maggie
,
and
*NL*
have
her
hand
in
his
so
long
,
was
beginning
to
possess
him
like
a
*NL*
thirst
.
But
even
now
their
hands
were
meeting
in
the
dance
,
--
were
*NL*
meeting
still
to
the
very
end
of
it
,
though
they
were
far
off
each
*NL*
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
hardly
knew
what
happened
,
or
in
what
automatic
way
he
got
*NL*
through
the
duties
of
politeness
in
the
interval
,
until
he
was
free
*NL*
and
saw
Maggie
seated
alone
again
,
at
the
farther
end
of
the
room
.
He
*NL*
made
his
way
toward
her
round
the
couples
that
were
forming
for
the
*NL*
waltz
;
and
when
Maggie
became
conscious
that
she
was
the
person
he
*NL*
sought
,
she
felt
,
in
spite
of
all
the
thoughts
that
had
gone
before
,
a
*NL*
glowing
gladness
at
heart
.
Her
eyes
and
cheeks
were
still
brightened
*NL*
with
her
childlike
enthusiasm
in
the
dance
;
her
whole
frame
was
set
to
*NL*
joy
and
tenderness
;
even
the
coming
pain
could
not
seem
bitter
,
--
she
*NL*
was
ready
to
welcome
it
as
a
part
of
life
,
for
life
at
this
moment
*NL*
seemed
a
keen
,
vibrating
consciousness
poised
above
pleasure
or
pain
.
*NL*
This
one
,
this
last
night
,
she
might
expand
unrestrainedly
in
the
*NL*
warmth
of
the
present
,
without
those
chill
,
eating
thoughts
of
the
*NL*
past
and
the
future
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
're
going
to
waltz
again
,
''
said
Stephen
,
bending
to
speak
to
her
,
*NL*
with
that
glance
and
tone
of
subdued
tenderness
which
young
dreams
*NL*
create
to
themselves
in
the
summer
woods
when
low
,
cooing
voices
fill
*NL*
the
air
.
Such
glances
and
tones
bring
the
breath
of
poetry
with
them
*NL*
into
a
room
that
is
half
stifling
with
glaring
gas
and
hard
*NL*
flirtation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
going
to
waltz
again
.
It
is
rather
dizzy
work
to
look
on
,
*NL*
and
the
room
is
very
warm
;
shall
we
walk
about
a
little
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
her
hand
and
placed
it
within
his
arm
,
and
they
walked
on
into
*NL*
the
sitting-room
,
where
the
tables
were
strewn
with
engravings
for
the
*NL*
accommodation
of
visitors
who
would
not
want
to
look
at
them
.
But
no
*NL*
visitors
were
here
at
this
moment
.
They
passed
on
into
the
*NL*
conservatory
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
strange
and
unreal
the
trees
and
flowers
look
with
the
lights
*NL*
among
them
!
''
said
Maggie
,
in
a
low
voice
.
``
They
look
as
if
they
*NL*
belonged
to
an
enchanted
land
,
and
would
never
fade
away
;
I
could
*NL*
fancy
they
were
all
made
of
jewels
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
looking
at
the
tier
of
geraniums
as
she
spoke
,
and
Stephen
*NL*
made
no
answer
;
but
he
was
looking
at
her
;
and
does
not
a
supreme
poet
*NL*
blend
light
and
sound
into
one
,
calling
darkness
mute
,
and
light
*NL*
eloquent
?
Something
strangely
powerful
there
was
in
the
light
of
*NL*
Stephen
's
long
gaze
,
for
it
made
Maggie
's
face
turn
toward
it
and
look
*NL*
upward
at
it
,
slowly
,
like
a
flower
at
the
ascending
brightness
.
And
*NL*
they
walked
unsteadily
on
,
without
feeling
that
they
were
walking
;
*NL*
without
feeling
anything
but
that
long
,
grave
,
mutual
gaze
which
has
*NL*
the
solemnity
belonging
to
all
deep
human
passion
.
The
hovering
*NL*
thought
that
they
must
and
would
renounce
each
other
made
this
moment
*NL*
of
mute
confession
more
intense
in
its
rapture
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
they
had
reached
the
end
of
the
conservatory
,
and
were
obliged
to
*NL*
pause
and
turn
.
The
change
of
movement
brought
a
new
consciousness
to
*NL*
Maggie
;
she
blushed
deeply
,
turned
away
her
head
,
and
drew
her
arm
*NL*
from
Stephen
's
,
going
up
to
some
flowers
to
smell
them
.
Stephen
stood
*NL*
motionless
,
and
still
pale
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
may
I
get
this
rose
?
''
said
Maggie
,
making
a
great
effort
to
say
*NL*
something
,
and
dissipate
the
burning
sense
of
irretrievable
*NL*
confession
.
``
I
think
I
am
quite
wicked
with
roses
;
I
like
to
gather
*NL*
them
and
smell
them
till
they
have
no
scent
left
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
was
mute
;
he
was
incapable
of
putting
a
sentence
together
,
and
*NL*
Maggie
bent
her
arm
a
little
upward
toward
the
large
half-opened
rose
*NL*
that
had
attracted
her
.
Who
has
not
felt
the
beauty
of
a
woman
's
arm
?
*NL*
The
unspeakable
suggestions
of
tenderness
that
lie
in
the
dimpled
*NL*
elbow
,
and
all
the
varied
gently
lessening
curves
,
down
to
the
*NL*
delicate
wrist
,
with
its
tiniest
,
almost
imperceptible
nicks
in
the
*NL*
firm
softness
.
A
woman
's
arm
touched
the
soul
of
a
great
sculptor
two
*NL*
thousand
years
ago
,
so
that
he
wrought
an
image
of
it
for
the
*NL*
Parthenon
which
moves
us
still
as
it
clasps
lovingly
the
timeworn
*NL*
marble
of
a
headless
trunk
.
Maggie
's
was
such
an
arm
as
that
,
and
it
*NL*
had
the
warm
tints
of
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
mad
impulse
seized
on
Stephen
;
he
darted
toward
the
arm
,
and
*NL*
showered
kisses
on
it
,
clasping
the
wrist
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
next
moment
Maggie
snatched
it
from
him
,
and
glared
at
him
*NL*
like
a
wounded
war-goddess
,
quivering
with
rage
and
humiliation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
dare
you
?
''
She
spoke
in
a
deeply
shaken
,
half-smothered
voice
.
*NL*
``
What
right
have
I
given
you
to
insult
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
darted
from
him
into
the
adjoining
room
,
and
threw
herself
on
the
*NL*
sofa
,
panting
and
trembling
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
horrible
punishment
was
come
upon
her
for
the
sin
of
allowing
a
*NL*
moment
's
happiness
that
was
treachery
to
Lucy
,
to
Philip
,
to
her
own
*NL*
better
soul
.
That
momentary
happiness
had
been
smitten
with
a
blight
,
*NL*
a
leprosy
;
Stephen
thought
more
lightly
of
_
her
_
than
he
did
of
Lucy
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
Stephen
,
he
leaned
back
against
the
framework
of
the
*NL*
conservatory
,
dizzy
with
the
conflict
of
passions
,
--
love
,
rage
,
and
*NL*
confused
despair
;
despair
at
his
want
of
self-mastery
,
and
despair
*NL*
that
he
had
offended
Maggie
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
last
feeling
surmounted
every
other
;
to
be
by
her
side
again
and
*NL*
entreat
forgiveness
was
the
only
thing
that
had
the
force
of
a
motive
*NL*
for
him
,
and
she
had
not
been
seated
more
than
a
few
minutes
when
he
*NL*
came
and
stood
humbly
before
her
.
But
Maggie
's
bitter
rage
was
*NL*
unspent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Leave
me
to
myself
,
if
you
please
,
''
she
said
,
with
impetuous
*NL*
haughtiness
,
``
and
for
the
future
avoid
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
turned
away
,
and
walked
backward
and
forward
at
the
other
end
*NL*
of
the
room
.
There
was
the
dire
necessity
of
going
back
into
the
*NL*
dancing-room
again
,
and
he
was
beginning
to
be
conscious
of
that
.
They
*NL*
had
been
absent
so
short
a
time
,
that
when
he
went
in
again
the
waltz
*NL*
was
not
ended
.
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
,
too
,
was
not
long
before
she
re-entered
.
All
the
pride
of
her
*NL*
nature
was
stung
into
activity
;
the
hateful
weakness
which
had
dragged
*NL*
her
within
reach
of
this
wound
to
her
self-respect
had
at
least
*NL*
wrought
its
own
cure
.
The
thoughts
and
temptations
of
the
last
month
*NL*
should
all
be
flung
away
into
an
unvisited
chamber
of
memory
.
There
*NL*
was
nothing
to
allure
her
now
;
duty
would
be
easy
,
and
all
the
old
*NL*
calm
purposes
would
reign
peacefully
once
more
.
She
re-entered
the
*NL*
drawing-room
still
with
some
excited
brightness
in
her
face
,
but
with
*NL*
a
sense
of
proud
self-command
that
defied
anything
to
agitate
her
.
She
*NL*
refused
to
dance
again
,
but
she
talked
quite
readily
and
calmly
with
*NL*
every
one
who
addressed
her
.
And
when
they
got
home
that
night
,
she
*NL*
kissed
Lucy
with
a
free
heart
,
almost
exulting
in
this
scorching
*NL*
moment
,
which
had
delivered
her
from
the
possibility
of
another
word
*NL*
or
look
that
would
have
the
stamp
of
treachery
toward
that
gentle
,
*NL*
unsuspicious
sister
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
morning
Maggie
did
not
set
off
to
Basset
quite
so
soon
as
she
*NL*
had
expected
.
Her
mother
was
to
accompany
her
in
the
carriage
,
and
*NL*
household
business
could
not
be
dispatched
hastily
by
Mrs.
Tulliver
.
*NL*
So
Maggie
,
who
had
been
in
a
hurry
to
prepare
herself
,
had
to
sit
*NL*
waiting
,
equipped
for
the
drive
,
in
the
garden
.
Lucy
was
busy
in
the
*NL*
house
wrapping
up
some
bazaar
presents
for
the
younger
ones
at
Basset
,
*NL*
and
when
there
was
a
loud
ring
at
the
door-bell
,
Maggie
felt
some
*NL*
alarm
lest
Lucy
should
bring
out
Stephen
to
her
;
it
was
sure
to
be
*NL*
Stephen
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
presently
the
visitor
came
out
into
the
garden
alone
,
and
seated
*NL*
himself
by
her
on
the
garden-chair
.
It
was
not
Stephen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
can
just
catch
the
tips
of
the
Scotch
firs
,
Maggie
,
from
this
*NL*
seat
,
''
said
Philip
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
taken
each
other
's
hands
in
silence
,
but
Maggie
had
looked
at
*NL*
him
with
a
more
complete
revival
of
the
old
childlike
affectionate
*NL*
smile
than
he
had
seen
before
,
and
he
felt
encouraged
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
she
said
,
``
I
often
look
at
them
,
and
wish
I
could
see
the
low
*NL*
sunlight
on
the
stems
again
.
But
I
have
never
been
that
way
but
*NL*
once
,
--
to
the
churchyard
with
my
mother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
been
there
,
I
go
there
,
continually
,
''
said
Philip
.
``
I
have
*NL*
nothing
but
the
past
to
live
upon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
keen
remembrance
and
keen
pity
impelled
Maggie
to
put
her
hand
in
*NL*
Philip
's
.
They
had
so
often
walked
hand
in
hand
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
remember
all
the
spots
,
''
she
said
,
--
``
just
where
you
told
me
of
*NL*
particular
things
,
beautiful
stories
that
I
had
never
heard
of
*NL*
before
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
go
there
again
soon
,
wo
n't
you
,
Maggie
?
''
said
Philip
,
*NL*
getting
timid
.
``
The
Mill
will
soon
be
your
brother
's
home
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
but
I
shall
not
be
there
,
''
said
Maggie
.
``
I
shall
only
hear
of
*NL*
that
happiness
.
I
am
going
away
again
;
Lucy
has
not
told
you
,
*NL*
perhaps
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
the
future
will
never
join
on
to
the
past
again
,
Maggie
?
That
*NL*
book
is
quite
closed
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
gray
eyes
that
had
so
often
looked
up
at
her
with
entreating
*NL*
worship
,
looked
up
at
her
now
,
with
a
last
struggling
ray
of
hope
in
*NL*
them
,
and
Maggie
met
them
with
her
large
sincere
gaze
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
book
never
will
be
closed
,
Philip
,
''
she
said
,
with
grave
*NL*
sadness
;
``
I
desire
no
future
that
will
break
the
ties
of
the
past
.
But
*NL*
the
tie
to
my
brother
is
one
of
the
strongest
.
I
can
do
nothing
*NL*
willingly
that
will
divide
me
always
from
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
the
only
reason
that
would
keep
us
apart
forever
,
Maggie
?
''
*NL*
said
Philip
,
with
a
desperate
determination
to
have
a
definite
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
only
reason
,
''
said
Maggie
,
with
calm
decision
.
And
she
believed
*NL*
it
.
At
that
moment
she
felt
as
if
the
enchanted
cup
had
been
dashed
to
*NL*
the
ground
.
The
reactionary
excitement
that
gave
her
a
proud
*NL*
self-mastery
had
not
subsided
,
and
she
looked
at
the
future
with
a
*NL*
sense
of
calm
choice
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
sat
hand
in
hand
without
looking
at
each
other
or
speaking
for
a
*NL*
few
minutes
;
in
Maggie
's
mind
the
first
scenes
of
love
and
parting
*NL*
were
more
present
than
the
actual
moment
,
and
she
was
looking
at
*NL*
Philip
in
the
Red
Deeps
.
*NL*
*NL*
Philip
felt
that
he
ought
to
have
been
thoroughly
happy
in
that
answer
*NL*
of
hers
;
she
was
as
open
and
transparent
as
a
rock-pool
.
Why
was
he
*NL*
not
thoroughly
happy
?
Jealousy
is
never
satisfied
with
anything
short
*NL*
of
an
omniscience
that
would
detect
the
subtlest
fold
of
the
heart
.

Chapter
XI
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
Lane
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
had
been
four
days
at
her
aunt
Moss
's
giving
the
early
June
*NL*
sunshine
quite
a
new
brightness
in
the
care-dimmed
eyes
of
that
*NL*
affectionate
woman
,
and
making
an
epoch
for
her
cousins
great
and
*NL*
small
,
who
were
learning
her
words
and
actions
by
heart
,
as
if
she
had
*NL*
been
a
transient
avatar
of
perfect
wisdom
and
beauty
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
standing
on
the
causeway
with
her
aunt
and
a
group
of
cousins
*NL*
feeding
the
chickens
,
at
that
quiet
moment
in
the
life
of
the
*NL*
farmyards
before
the
afternoon
milking-time
.
The
great
buildings
round
*NL*
the
hollow
yard
were
as
dreary
and
tumbledown
as
ever
,
but
over
the
*NL*
old
garden-wall
the
straggling
rose-bushes
were
beginning
to
toss
*NL*
their
summer
weight
,
and
the
gray
wood
and
old
bricks
of
the
house
,
on
*NL*
its
higher
level
,
had
a
look
of
sleepy
age
in
the
broad
afternoon
*NL*
sunlight
,
that
suited
the
quiescent
time
.
Maggie
,
with
her
bonnet
over
*NL*
her
arm
,
was
smiling
down
at
the
hatch
of
small
fluffy
chickens
,
when
*NL*
her
aunt
exclaimed
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Goodness
me
!
who
is
that
gentleman
coming
in
at
the
gate
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
gentleman
on
a
tall
bay
horse
;
and
the
flanks
and
neck
of
the
*NL*
horse
were
streaked
black
with
fast
riding
.
Maggie
felt
a
beating
at
*NL*
head
and
heart
,
horrible
as
the
sudden
leaping
to
life
of
a
savage
*NL*
enemy
who
had
feigned
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
it
,
my
dear
?
''
said
Mrs.
Moss
,
seeing
in
Maggie
's
face
the
*NL*
evidence
that
she
knew
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
Mr.
Stephen
Guest
,
''
said
Maggie
,
rather
faintly
.
``
My
cousin
*NL*
Lucy
's
--
a
gentleman
who
is
very
intimate
at
my
cousin
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
was
already
close
to
them
,
had
jumped
off
his
horse
,
and
now
*NL*
raised
his
hat
as
he
advanced
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hold
the
horse
,
Willy
,
''
said
Mrs.
Moss
to
the
twelve-year-old
boy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
thank
you
,
''
said
Stephen
,
pulling
at
the
horse
's
impatiently
*NL*
tossing
head
.
``
I
must
be
going
again
immediately
.
I
have
a
message
to
*NL*
deliver
to
you
,
Miss
Tulliver
,
on
private
business
.
May
I
take
the
*NL*
liberty
of
asking
you
to
walk
a
few
yards
with
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
a
half-jaded
,
half-irritated
look
,
such
as
a
man
gets
when
he
*NL*
has
been
dogged
by
some
care
or
annoyance
that
makes
his
bed
and
his
*NL*
dinner
of
little
use
to
him
.
He
spoke
almost
abruptly
,
as
if
his
*NL*
errand
were
too
pressing
for
him
to
trouble
himself
about
what
would
*NL*
be
thought
by
Mrs.
Moss
of
his
visit
and
request
.
Good
Mrs.
Moss
,
*NL*
rather
nervous
in
the
presence
of
this
apparently
haughty
gentleman
,
*NL*
was
inwardly
wondering
whether
she
would
be
doing
right
or
wrong
to
*NL*
invite
him
again
to
leave
his
horse
and
walk
in
,
when
Maggie
,
feeling
*NL*
all
the
embarrassment
of
the
situation
,
and
unable
to
say
anything
,
*NL*
put
on
her
bonnet
,
and
turned
to
walk
toward
the
gate
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
turned
too
,
and
walked
by
her
side
,
leading
his
horse
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
a
word
was
spoken
till
they
were
out
in
the
lane
,
and
had
walked
*NL*
four
or
five
yards
,
when
Maggie
,
who
had
been
looking
straight
before
*NL*
her
all
the
while
,
turned
again
to
walk
back
,
saying
,
with
haughty
*NL*
resentment
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
no
need
for
me
to
go
any
farther
.
I
do
n't
know
whether
you
*NL*
consider
it
gentlemanly
and
delicate
conduct
to
place
me
in
a
position
*NL*
that
forced
me
to
come
out
with
you
,
or
whether
you
wished
to
insult
*NL*
me
still
further
by
thrusting
an
interview
upon
me
in
this
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
you
are
angry
with
me
for
coming
,
''
said
Stephen
,
bitterly
.
*NL*
``
Of
course
it
is
of
no
consequence
what
a
man
has
to
suffer
;
it
is
*NL*
only
your
woman
's
dignity
that
you
care
about
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
gave
a
slight
start
,
such
as
might
have
come
from
the
slightest
*NL*
possible
electric
shock
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
if
it
were
not
enough
that
I
'm
entangled
in
this
way
;
that
I
'm
mad
*NL*
with
love
for
you
;
that
I
resist
the
strongest
passion
a
man
can
feel
,
*NL*
because
I
try
to
be
true
to
other
claims
;
but
you
must
treat
me
as
if
*NL*
I
were
a
coarse
brute
,
who
would
willingly
offend
you
.
And
when
,
if
I
*NL*
had
my
own
choice
,
I
should
ask
you
to
take
my
hand
and
my
fortune
and
*NL*
my
whole
life
,
and
do
what
you
liked
with
them
!
I
know
I
forgot
*NL*
myself
.
I
took
an
unwarrantable
liberty
.
I
hate
myself
for
having
done
*NL*
it
.
But
I
repented
immediately
;
I
've
been
repenting
ever
since
.
You
*NL*
ought
not
to
think
it
unpardonable
;
a
man
who
loves
with
his
whole
*NL*
soul
,
as
I
do
you
,
is
liable
to
be
mastered
by
his
feelings
for
a
*NL*
moment
;
but
you
know
--
you
must
believe
--
that
the
worst
pain
I
could
*NL*
have
is
to
have
pained
you
;
that
I
would
give
the
world
to
recall
the
*NL*
error
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
dared
not
speak
,
dared
not
turn
her
head
.
The
strength
that
had
*NL*
come
from
resentment
was
all
gone
,
and
her
lips
were
quivering
*NL*
visibly
.
She
could
not
trust
herself
to
utter
the
full
forgiveness
*NL*
that
rose
in
answer
to
that
confession
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
come
nearly
in
front
of
the
gate
again
,
and
she
paused
,
*NL*
trembling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
not
say
these
things
;
I
must
not
hear
them
,
''
she
said
,
*NL*
looking
down
in
misery
,
as
Stephen
came
in
front
of
her
,
to
prevent
*NL*
her
from
going
farther
toward
the
gate
.
``
I
'm
very
sorry
for
any
pain
*NL*
you
have
to
go
through
;
but
it
is
of
no
use
to
speak
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
_
is
_
of
use
,
''
said
Stephen
,
impetuously
.
``
It
would
be
of
use
*NL*
if
you
would
treat
me
with
some
sort
of
pity
and
consideration
,
*NL*
instead
of
doing
me
vile
injustice
in
your
mind
.
I
could
bear
*NL*
everything
more
quietly
if
I
knew
you
did
n't
hate
me
for
an
insolent
*NL*
coxcomb
.
Look
at
me
;
see
what
a
hunted
devil
I
am
;
I
've
been
riding
*NL*
thirty
miles
every
day
to
get
away
from
the
thought
of
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
did
not
--
dared
not
--
look
.
She
had
already
seen
the
harassed
*NL*
face
.
But
she
said
gently
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
any
evil
of
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
dearest
,
look
at
me
,
''
said
Stephen
,
in
deepest
,
tenderest
tones
*NL*
of
entreaty
.
``
Do
n't
go
away
from
me
yet
.
Give
me
a
moment
's
happiness
;
*NL*
make
me
feel
you
've
forgiven
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
do
forgive
you
,
''
said
Maggie
,
shaken
by
those
tones
,
and
all
*NL*
the
more
frightened
at
herself
.
``
But
pray
let
me
go
in
again
.
Pray
go
*NL*
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
great
tear
fell
from
under
her
lowered
eyelids
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
go
away
from
you
;
I
ca
n't
leave
you
,
''
said
Stephen
,
with
*NL*
still
more
passionate
pleading
.
``
I
shall
come
back
again
if
you
send
*NL*
me
away
with
this
coldness
;
I
ca
n't
answer
for
myself
.
But
if
you
will
*NL*
go
with
me
only
a
little
way
I
can
live
on
that
.
You
see
plainly
*NL*
enough
that
your
anger
has
only
made
me
ten
times
more
unreasonable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
turned
.
But
Tancred
,
the
bay
horse
,
began
to
make
such
spirited
*NL*
remonstrances
against
this
frequent
change
of
direction
,
that
Stephen
,
*NL*
catching
sight
of
Willy
Moss
peeping
through
the
gate
,
called
out
,
*NL*
``
Here
!
just
come
and
hold
my
horse
for
five
minutes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
''
said
Maggie
,
hurriedly
,
``
my
aunt
will
think
it
so
strange
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
mind
,
''
Stephen
answered
impatiently
;
``
they
do
n't
know
the
*NL*
people
at
St.
Ogg
's
.
Lead
him
up
and
down
just
here
for
five
minutes
,
''
*NL*
he
added
to
Willy
,
who
was
now
close
to
them
;
and
then
he
turned
to
*NL*
Maggie
's
side
,
and
they
walked
on
.
It
was
clear
that
she
_
must
_
go
on
*NL*
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
my
arm
,
''
said
Stephen
,
entreatingly
;
and
she
took
it
,
feeling
*NL*
all
the
while
as
if
she
were
sliding
downward
in
a
nightmare
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
no
end
to
this
misery
,
''
she
began
,
struggling
to
repel
the
*NL*
influence
by
speech
.
``
It
is
wicked
--
base
--
ever
allowing
a
word
or
look
*NL*
that
Lucy
--
that
others
might
not
have
seen
.
Think
of
Lucy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
think
of
her
--
bless
her
.
If
I
did
n't
--
''
Stephen
had
laid
his
*NL*
hand
on
Maggie
's
that
rested
on
his
arm
,
and
they
both
felt
it
*NL*
difficult
to
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
have
other
ties
,
''
Maggie
went
on
,
at
last
,
with
a
desperate
*NL*
effort
,
``
even
if
Lucy
did
not
exist
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
engaged
to
Philip
Wakem
?
''
said
Stephen
,
hastily
.
``
Is
it
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
consider
myself
engaged
to
him
;
I
do
n't
mean
to
marry
any
one
*NL*
else
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
was
silent
again
until
they
had
turned
out
of
the
sun
into
a
*NL*
side
lane
,
all
grassy
and
sheltered
.
Then
he
burst
out
impetuously
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
unnatural
,
it
is
horrible
.
Maggie
,
if
you
loved
me
as
I
love
*NL*
you
,
we
should
throw
everything
else
to
the
winds
for
the
sake
of
*NL*
belonging
to
each
other
.
We
should
break
all
these
mistaken
ties
that
*NL*
were
made
in
blindness
,
and
determine
to
marry
each
other
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
rather
die
than
fall
into
that
temptation
,
''
said
Maggie
,
with
*NL*
deep
,
slow
distinctness
,
all
the
gathered
spiritual
force
of
painful
*NL*
years
coming
to
her
aid
in
this
extremity
.
She
drew
her
arm
from
his
*NL*
as
she
spoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
,
then
,
that
you
do
n't
care
for
me
,
''
he
said
,
almost
*NL*
violently
.
``
Tell
me
that
you
love
some
one
else
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
darted
through
Maggie
's
mind
that
here
was
a
mode
of
releasing
*NL*
herself
from
outward
struggle
,
--
to
tell
Stephen
that
her
whole
heart
*NL*
was
Philip
's
.
But
her
lips
would
not
utter
that
,
and
she
was
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
do
love
me
,
dearest
,
''
said
Stephen
,
gently
,
taking
her
hand
*NL*
again
and
laying
it
within
his
arm
,
``
it
is
better
--
it
is
right
that
we
*NL*
should
marry
each

the

It

come
upon

it

natural
;
it
has
taken
hold
of

of
every
effort

have
made
to

it

God
knows

tacit

only
made

things
worse

better
have
given
way
at
first

*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
was
silent
.
If
it
were
_
not
_
wrong
--
if
she
were
once
convinced
*NL*
of
that
,
and
need
no
longer
beat
and
struggle
against
this
current
,
*NL*
soft
and
yet
strong
as
the
summer
stream
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
`
yes
,
'
dearest
,
''
said
Stephen
,
leaning
to
look
entreatingly
in
*NL*
her
face
.
``
What
could
we
care
about
in
the
whole
world
beside
,
if
we
*NL*
belonged
to
each
other
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
breath
was
on
his
face
,
his
lips
were
very
near
hers
,
but
there
*NL*
was
a
great
dread
dwelling
in
his
love
for
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
lips
and
eyelids
quivered
;
she
opened
her
eyes
full
on
his
for
an
*NL*
instant
,
like
a
lovely
wild
animal
timid
and
struggling
under
*NL*
caresses
,
and
then
turned
sharp
round
toward
home
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
after
all
,
''
he
went
on
,
in
an
impatient
tone
,
trying
to
defeat
*NL*
his
own
scruples
as
well
as
hers
,
``
I
am
breaking
no
positive
*NL*
engagement
;
if
Lucy
's
affections
had
been
withdrawn
from
me
and
given
*NL*
to
some
one
else
,
I
should
have
felt
no
right
to
assert
a
claim
on
*NL*
her
.
If
you
are
not
absolutely
pledged
to
Philip
,
we
are
neither
of
us
*NL*
bound
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
believe
that
;
it
is
not
your
real
feeling
,
''
said
Maggie
,
*NL*
earnestly
.
``
You
feel
,
as
I
do
,
that
the
real
tie
lies
in
the
feelings
*NL*
and
expectations
we
have
raised
in
other
minds
.
Else
all
pledges
might
*NL*
be
broken
,
when
there
was
no
outward
penalty
.
There
would
be
no
such
*NL*
thing
as
faithfulness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
was
silent
;
he
could
not
pursue
that
argument
;
the
opposite
*NL*
conviction
had
wrought
in
him
too
strongly
through
his
previous
time
*NL*
of
struggle
.
But
it
soon
presented
itself
in
a
new
form
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
pledge
_
ca
n't
_
be
fulfilled
,
''
he
said
,
with
impetuous
insistence
.
*NL*
``
It
is
unnatural
;
we
can
only
pretend
to
give
ourselves
to
any
one
*NL*
else
.
There
is
wrong
in
that
too
;
there
may
be
misery
in
it
for
_
them
_
*NL*
as
well
as
for
us
.
Maggie
,
you
must
see
that
;
you
do
see
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
looking
eagerly
at
her
face
for
the
least
sign
of
compliance
;
*NL*
his
large
,
firm
,
gentle
grasp
was
on
her
hand
.
She
was
silent
for
a
*NL*
few
moments
,
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
;
then
she
drew
a
deep
*NL*
breath
,
and
said
,
looking
up
at
him
with
solemn
sadness
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it
is
difficult
,
--
life
is
very
difficult
!
It
seems
right
to
me
*NL*
sometimes
that
we
should
follow
our
strongest
feeling
;
but
then
,
such
*NL*
feelings
continually
come
across
the
ties
that
all
our
former
life
has
*NL*
made
for
us
,
--
the
ties
that
have
made
others
dependent
on
us
,
--
and
*NL*
would
cut
them
in
two
.
If
life
were
quite
easy
and
simple
,
as
it
might
*NL*
have
been
in
Paradise
,
and
we
could
always
see
that
one
being
first
*NL*
toward
whom
--
I
mean
,
if
life
did
not
make
duties
for
us
before
love
*NL*
comes
,
love
would
be
a
sign
that
two
people
ought
to
belong
to
each
*NL*
other
.
But
I
see
--
I
feel
it
is
not
so
now
;
there
are
things
we
must
*NL*
renounce
in
life
;
some
of
us
must
resign
love
.
Many
things
are
*NL*
difficult
and
dark
to
me
;
but
I
see
one
thing
quite
clearly
,
--
that
I
*NL*
must
not
,
can
not
,
seek
my
own
happiness
by
sacrificing
others
.
Love
is
*NL*
natural
;
but
surely
pity
and
faithfulness
and
memory
are
natural
too
.
*NL*
And
they
would
live
in
me
still
,
and
punish
me
if
I
did
not
obey
them
.
*NL*
I
should
be
haunted
by
the
suffering
I
had
caused
.
Our
love
would
be
*NL*
poisoned
.
Do
n't
urge
me
;
help
me
,
--
help
me
,
_
because
_
I
love
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
had
become
more
and
more
earnest
as
she
went
on
;
her
face
had
*NL*
become
flushed
,
and
her
eyes
fuller
and
fuller
of
appealing
love
.
*NL*
Stephen
had
the
fibre
of
nobleness
in
him
that
vibrated
to
her
appeal
;
*NL*
but
in
the
same
moment
--
how
could
it
be
otherwise
?
--
that
pleading
*NL*
beauty
gained
new
power
over
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dearest
,
''
he
said
,
in
scarcely
more
than
a
whisper
,
while
his
arm
*NL*
stole
round
her
,
``
I
'll
do
,
I
'll
bear
anything
you
wish
.
But
--
one
*NL*
kiss
--
one
--
the
last
--
before
we
part
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
One
kiss
,
and
then
a
long
look
,
until
Maggie
said
tremulously
,
``
Let
me
*NL*
go
,
--
let
me
make
haste
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
hurried
along
,
and
not
another
word
was
spoken
.
Stephen
stood
*NL*
still
and
beckoned
when
they
came
within
sight
of
Willy
and
the
horse
,
*NL*
and
Maggie
went
on
through
the
gate
.
Mrs.
Moss
was
standing
alone
at
*NL*
the
door
of
the
old
porch
;
she
had
sent
all
the
cousins
in
,
with
kind
*NL*
thoughtfulness
.
It
might
be
a
joyful
thing
that
Maggie
had
a
rich
and
*NL*
handsome
lover
,
but
she
would
naturally
feel
embarrassed
at
coming
in
*NL*
again
;
and
it
might
_
not
_
be
joyful
.
In
either
case
Mrs.
Moss
waited
*NL*
anxiously
to
receive
Maggie
by
herself
.
The
speaking
face
told
plainly
*NL*
enough
that
,
if
there
was
joy
,
it
was
of
a
very
agitating
,
dubious
*NL*
sort
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sit
down
here
a
bit
,
my
dear
.
''
She
drew
Maggie
into
the
porch
,
and
*NL*
sat
down
on
the
bench
by
her
;
there
was
no
privacy
in
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
aunt
Gritty
,
I
'm
very
wretched
!
I
wish
I
could
have
died
when
I
*NL*
was
fifteen
.
It
seemed
so
easy
to
give
things
up
then
;
it
is
so
hard
*NL*
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
poor
child
threw
her
arms
round
her
aunt
's
neck
,
and
fell
into
*NL*
long
,
deep
sobs
.

Chapter

*NL*
*NL*
A
Family
Party
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
left
her
good
aunt
Gritty
at
the
end
of
the
week
,
and
went
to
*NL*
Garum
Firs
to
pay
her
visit
to
aunt
Pullet
according
to
agreement
.
In
*NL*
the
mean
time
very
unexpected
things
had
happened
,
and
there
was
to
be
*NL*
a
family
party
at
Garum
to
discuss
and
celebrate
a
change
in
the
*NL*
fortunes
of
the
Tullivers
,
which
was
likely
finally
to
carry
away
the
*NL*
shadow
of
their
demerits
like
the
last
limb
of
an
eclipse
,
and
cause
*NL*
their
hitherto
obscured
virtues
to
shine
forth
in
full-rounded
*NL*
splendor
.
It
is
pleasant
to
know
that
a
new
ministry
just
come
into
*NL*
office
are
not
the
only
fellow-men
who
enjoy
a
period
of
high
*NL*
appreciation
and
full-blown
eulogy
;
in
many
respectable
families
*NL*
throughout
this
realm
,
relatives
becoming
creditable
meet
with
a
*NL*
similar
cordiality
of
recognition
,
which
in
its
fine
freedom
from
the
*NL*
coercion
of
any
antecedents
,
suggests
the
hopeful
possibility
that
we
*NL*
may
some
day
without
any
notice
find
ourselves
in
full
millennium
,
*NL*
with
cockatrices
who
have
ceased
to
bite
,
and
wolves
that
no
longer
*NL*
show
their
teeth
with
any
but
the
blandest
intentions
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
came
so
early
as
to
have
the
start
even
of
aunt
Glegg
;
for
she
*NL*
longed
to
have
some
undisturbed
talk
with
Maggie
about
the
wonderful
*NL*
news
.
It
seemed
,
did
it
not
?
said
Lucy
,
with
her
prettiest
air
of
*NL*
wisdom
,
as
if
everything
,
even
other
people
's
misfortunes
-LRB-
poor
*NL*
creatures
!
-RRB-
were
conspiring
now
to
make
poor
dear
aunt
Tulliver
,
and
*NL*
cousin
Tom
,
and
naughty
Maggie
too
,
if
she
were
not
obstinately
bent
*NL*
on
the
contrary
,
as
happy
as
they
deserved
to
be
after
all
their
*NL*
troubles
.
To
think
that
the
very
day
--
the
_
very
day
_
--
after
Tom
had
*NL*
come
back
from
Newcastle
,
that
unfortunate
young
Jetsome
,
whom
Mr.
*NL*
Wakem
had
placed
at
the
Mill
,
had
been
pitched
off
his
horse
in
a
*NL*
drunken
fit
,
and
was
lying
at
St.
Ogg
's
in
a
dangerous
state
,
so
that
*NL*
Wakem
had
signified
his
wish
that
the
new
purchasers
should
enter
on
*NL*
the
premises
at
once
!
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
very
dreadful
for
that
unhappy
young
man
,
but
it
did
seem
as
if
*NL*
the
misfortune
had
happened
then
,
rather
than
at
any
other
time
,
in
*NL*
order
that
cousin
Tom
might
all
the
sooner
have
the
fit
reward
of
his
*NL*
exemplary
conduct
,
--
papa
thought
so
very
highly
of
him
.
Aunt
Tulliver
*NL*
must
certainly
go
to
the
Mill
now
,
and
keep
house
for
Tom
;
that
was
*NL*
rather
a
loss
to
Lucy
in
the
matter
of
household
comfort
;
but
then
,
to
*NL*
think
of
poor
aunty
being
in
her
old
place
again
,
and
gradually
*NL*
getting
comforts
about
her
there
!
*NL*
*NL*
On
this
last
point
Lucy
had
her
cunning
projects
,
and
when
she
and
*NL*
Maggie
had
made
their
dangerous
way
down
the
bright
stairs
into
the
*NL*
handsome
parlor
,
where
the
very
sunbeams
seemed
cleaner
than
*NL*
elsewhere
,
she
directed
her
manoeuvres
,
as
any
other
great
tactician
*NL*
would
have
done
,
against
the
weaker
side
of
the
enemy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aunt
Pullet
,
''
she
said
,
seating
herself
on
the
sofa
,
and
caressingly
*NL*
adjusting
that
lady
's
floating
cap-string
,
``
I
want
you
to
make
up
your
*NL*
mind
what
linen
and
things
you
will
give
Tom
toward
housekeeping
;
*NL*
because
you
are
always
so
generous
,
--
you
give
such
nice
things
,
you
*NL*
know
;
and
if
you
set
the
example
,
aunt
Glegg
will
follow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
she
never
can
,
my
dear
,
''
said
Mrs.
Pullet
,
with
unusual
vigor
,
*NL*
``
for
she
has
n't
got
the
linen
to
follow
suit
wi

mine
,
I
can
tell
you
.
*NL*
She
'd
niver
the
taste
,
not
if
she
'd
spend
the
money
.
Big
checks
and
*NL*
live
things
,
like
stags
and
foxes
,
all
her
table-linen
is
,
--
not
a
spot
*NL*
nor
a
diamond
among
'em
.
But
it
's
poor
work
dividing
one
's
linen
*NL*
before
one
dies
,
--
I
niver
thought
to
ha
'
done
that

Bessy
,
''
Mrs.
*NL*
Pullet
continued
,
shaking
her
head
and
looking
at
her
sister
Tulliver
,
*NL*
``
when
you
and
me
chose
the
double
diamont
,
the
first
flax
iver
we
'd
*NL*
spun

and
the
Lord
knows
where
yours
is
gone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'd
no
choice
,
I
'm
sure
,
sister
,
''
said
poor
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
accustomed
*NL*
to
consider
herself
in
the
light
of
an
accused
person
.
``
I
'm
sure
it
*NL*
was
no
wish
o

mine
,
iver
,
as
I
should
lie
awake
o

nights
thinking
o

*NL*
my
best
bleached
linen
all
over
the
country
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
a
peppermint
,
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
''
said
uncle
Pullet
,
feeling
that
he
*NL*
was
offering
a
cheap
and
wholesome
form
of
comfort
,
which
he
was
*NL*
recommending
by
example
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
but
,
aunt
Pullet
,
''
said
Lucy
,
``
you
've
so
much
beautiful
linen
.
*NL*
And
suppose
you
had
had
daughters
!
Then
you
must
have
divided
it
when
*NL*
they
were
married
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
do
n't
say
as
I
wo
n't
do
it
,
''
said
Mrs.
Pullet
,
``
for
now
Tom
's
*NL*
so
lucky
,
it
's
nothing
but
right
his
friends
should
look
on
him
and
*NL*
help
him
.
There
's
the
tablecloths
I
bought
at
your
sale
,
Bessy
;
it
was
*NL*
nothing
but
good
natur
'
o

me
to
buy
'em

for
they
've
been
lying
in

the
chest
ever

But
I

not
going

give
Maggie
any
more
o

my
*NL*
Indy
muslin
and
things
,
if
she
's
to
go
into
service
again
,
when
she
*NL*
might
stay
and
keep
me
company
,
and
do
my
sewing
for
me
,
if
she
was
n't
*NL*
wanted
at
her
brother
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Going
into
service
''
was
the
expression
by
which
the
Dodson
mind
*NL*
represented
to
itself
the
position
of
teacher
or
governess
;
and
*NL*
Maggie
's
return
to
that
menial
condition
,
now
circumstances
offered
*NL*
her
more
eligible
prospects
,
was
likely
to
be
a
sore
point
with
all
*NL*
her
relatives
,
besides
Lucy
.
Maggie
in
her
crude
form
,
with
her
hair
*NL*
down
her
back
,
and
altogether
in
a
state
of
dubious
promise
,
was
a
*NL*
most
undesirable
niece
;
but
now
she
was
capable
of
being
at
once
*NL*
ornamental
and
useful
.
The
subject
was
revived
in
aunt
and
uncle
*NL*
Glegg
's
presence
,
over
the
tea
and
muffins
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hegh

hegh

said
Mr.
Glegg
,
good-naturedly
patting
Maggie
on
the
*NL*
back

``
nonsense

Do

picked
up

``
Mr.

said
his
wife
,
with
that
shade
of
increased
politeness
in
*NL*
her
severity
which
she
always
put
on
with
her
crisper
fronts
,
``
you
'll
*NL*
excuse
me
,
but
you
're
far
too
light
for
a
man
of
your
years

It
's
*NL*
respect
and
duty
to
her
aunts
,
and
the
rest
of
her
kin
as
are
so
good
*NL*
to
her
,
should
have
kept
my
niece
from
fixing
about
going
away
again

not
sweethearts

I
'm
to

They

said
Mr.
Glegg
,
*NL*
winking
pleasantly
;
while
Mr.
Pullet
,
at
the
suggestion
of
sweetness
,
*NL*
took
a
little
more
sugar
.
*NL*
*NL*

Mrs.

said
Mrs.
Pullet
;
``

joke

*NL*
``

Mrs.

broke
in
anxiously
,

Mrs.

``

*NL*
``

exclaimed

,
clapping
her
hands
.
``
He

come
on

Sindbad

I
was
afraid
he
was

keep
his
*NL*
promise
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
jumped
up
to
kiss
Tom
as
he
entered
,
with
strong
feeling
,
at
*NL*
this
first
meeting
since
the
prospect
of
returning
to
the
Mill
had
*NL*
been
opened
to
him
;
and
she
kept
his
hand
,
leading
him
to
the
chair
by
*NL*
her
side
.
To
have
no
cloud
between
herself
and
Tom
was
still
a
*NL*
perpetual
yearning
in
her
,
that
had
its
root
deeper
than
all
change
.
*NL*
He
smiled
at
her
very
kindly
this
evening
,
and
said
,
``
Well
,
Magsie
,
*NL*
how
's
aunt
Moss
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come

said
Mr.

putting
out
his

``
Why

I

*NL*
``
But
I

'll
bear
in
mind
as
it
's
his
mother

family

it
to

said
Mrs.
Glegg
.
``
If
he
had
n't
had
them

take

he

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

said
aunt
Pullet
;
``
allays
the
doctor
called

But

I
said

I
mean
to

one

I
*NL*
do
n't

that
_
I
shall
do
,
and
if
I
should
*NL*
die
to-morrow
,
Mr.
Pullet
,
you
'll
bear
it
in
mind
,
--
though
you
'll
be
*NL*
blundering
with
the
keys
,
and
never
remember
as
that
on

third
*NL*
shelf

the
left-hand
wardrobe

night-caps

lost

''
This
gloomy
prospect
of
the
confusion
that
would
*NL*
ensue
on
her
decease
was
very
affecting
to
Mrs.
Pullet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
carry
it
too
far
,
Sophy
,
--
that
locking
in
and
out

''
said
Mrs.
*NL*
Glegg
,
in
a
tone
of
some
disgust
at
this
folly
.
``
You
go
beyond
your
*NL*
own
family
.
There
's
nobody
can
say
I
do
n't
lock
up
;
but
I
do
what
's
*NL*
reasonable
,
and
no
more
.
And
as
for
the
linen
,
I
shall
look
out
what
's
*NL*
serviceable
,
to
make
a
present
of
to
my
nephey
;
I
've
got
cloth
as
has
*NL*
never
been
whitened
,
better
worth
having
than
other
people
's
fine
*NL*
holland
;
and
I
hope
he
'll
lie
down
in
it
and
think
of
his
aunt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
thanked
Mrs.
Glegg
,
but
evaded
any
promise
to
meditate
nightly
on
*NL*
her
virtues
;
and
Mrs.
Glegg
effected
a
diversion
for
him
by
asking
*NL*
about
Mr.
Deane
's
intentions
concerning
steam
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
had
had
her
far-sighted
views
in
begging
Tom
to
come
on
Sindbad
.
*NL*
It
appeared
,
when
it
was
time
to
go
home
,
that
the
man-servant
was
to
*NL*
ride
the
horse
,
and
cousin
Tom
was
to
drive
home
his
mother
and
Lucy
.
*NL*
``
You
must
sit
by
yourself
,
aunty
,
''
said
that
contriving
young
lady
,
*NL*
``
because
I
must
sit
by
Tom
;
I
've
a
great
deal
to
say
to
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
eagerness
of
her
affectionate
anxiety
for
Maggie
,
Lucy
could
*NL*
not
persuade
herself
to
defer
a
conversation
about
her
with
Tom
,
who
,
*NL*
she
thought
,
with
such
a
cup
of
joy
before
him
as
this
rapid
*NL*
fulfilment
of
his
wish
about
the
Mill
,
must
become
pliant
and
*NL*
flexible
.
Her
nature
supplied
her
with
no
key
to
Tom
's
;
and
she
was
*NL*
puzzled
as
well
as
pained
to
notice
the
unpleasant
change
on
his
*NL*
countenance
when
she
gave
him
the
history
of
the
way
in
which
Philip
*NL*
had
used
his
influence
with
his
father
.
She
had
counted
on
this
*NL*
revelation
as
a
great
stroke
of
policy
,
which
was
to
turn
Tom
's
heart
*NL*
toward
Philip
at
once
,
and
,
besides
that
,
prove
that
the
elder
Wakem
*NL*
was
ready
to
receive
Maggie
with
all
the
honors
of
a
daughter-in-law
.
*NL*
Nothing
was
wanted
,
then
,
but
for
dear
Tom
,
who
always
had
that
*NL*
pleasant
smile
when
he
looked
at
cousin
Lucy
,
to
turn
completely
*NL*
round
,
say
the
opposite
of
what
he
had
always
said
before
,
and
declare
*NL*
that
he
,
for
his
part
,
was
delighted
that
all
the
old
grievances
*NL*
should
be
healed
,
and
that
Maggie
should
have
Philip
with
all
suitable
*NL*
despatch
;
in
cousin
Lucy
's
opinion
nothing
could
be
easier
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
to
minds
strongly
marked
by
the
positive
and
negative
qualities
*NL*
that
create
severity
,
--
strength
of
will
,
conscious
rectitude
of
*NL*
purpose
,
narrowness
of
imagination
and
intellect
,
great
power
of
*NL*
self-control
,
and
a
disposition
to
exert
control
over
others
,
--
prejudices
*NL*
come
as
the
natural
food
of
tendencies
which
can
get
no
sustenance
*NL*
out
of
that
complex
,
fragmentary
,
doubt-provoking
knowledge
which
*NL*
we
call
truth
.
Let
a
prejudice
be
bequeathed
,
carried
in
the
air
,
*NL*
adopted
by
hearsay
,
caught
in
through
the
eye
,
--
however
it
may
come
,
*NL*
these
minds
will
give
it
a
habitation
;
it
is
something
to
assert
*NL*
strongly
and
bravely
,
something
to
fill
up
the
void
of
spontaneous
*NL*
ideas
,
something
to
impose
on
others
with
the
authority
of
conscious
*NL*
right
;
it
is
at
once
a
staff
and
a
baton
.
Every
prejudice
that
will
*NL*
answer
these
purposes
is
self-evident
.
Our
good
,
upright
Tom
Tulliver
's
*NL*
mind
was
of
this
class
;
his
inward
criticism
of
his
father
's
faults
*NL*
did
not
prevent
him
from
adopting
his
father
's
prejudice
;
it
was
a
*NL*
prejudice
against
a
man
of
lax
principle
and
lax
life
,
and
it
was
a
*NL*
meeting-point
for
all
the
disappointed
feelings
of
family
and
personal
*NL*
pride
.
Other
feelings
added
their
force
to
produce
Tom
's
bitter
*NL*
repugnance
to
Philip
,
and
to
Maggie
's
union
with
him
;
and
*NL*
notwithstanding
Lucy
's
power
over
her
strong-willed
cousin
,
she
got
*NL*
nothing
but
a
cold
refusal
ever
to
sanction
such
a
marriage
;
``
but
of
*NL*
course
Maggie
could
do
as
she
liked
,
--
she
had
declared
her
*NL*
determination
to
be
independent
.
For
Tom
's
part
,
he
held
himself
bound
*NL*
by
his
duty
to
his
father
's
memory
,
and
by
every
manly
feeling
,
never
*NL*
to
consent
to
any
relation
with
the
Wakems
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
,
all
that
Lucy
had
effected
by
her
zealous
mediation
was
to
fill
*NL*
Tom
's
mind
with
the
expectation
that
Maggie
's
perverse
resolve
to
go
*NL*
into
a
situation
again
would
presently
metamorphose
itself
,
as
her
*NL*
resolves
were
apt
to
do
,
into
something
equally
perverse
,
but
entirely
*NL*
different
,
--
a
marriage
with
Philip
Wakem
.

Chapter

*NL*
*NL*
Borne
Along
by
the
Tide
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
In
less
than
a
week
Maggie
was
at
St.
Ogg
's
again
,
--
outwardly
in
much
*NL*
the
same
position
as
when
her
visit
there
had
just
begun
.
It
was
easy
*NL*
for
her
to
fill
her
mornings
apart
from
Lucy
without
any
obvious
*NL*
effort
;
for
she
had
her
promised
visits
to
pay
to
her
aunt
Glegg
,
and
*NL*
it
was
natural
that
she
should
give
her
mother
more
than
usual
of
her
*NL*
companionship
in
these
last
weeks
,
especially
as
there
were
*NL*
preparations
to
be
thought
of
for
Tom
's
housekeeping
.
But
Lucy
would
*NL*
hear
of
no
pretext
for
her
remaining
away
in
the
evenings
;
she
must
*NL*
always
come
from
aunt
Glegg
's
before
dinner
,
--
``
else
what
shall
I
have
*NL*
of
you
?
''
said
Lucy
,
with
a
tearful
pout
that
could
not
be
resisted
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
Mr.
Stephen
Guest
had
unaccountably
taken
to
dining
at
Mr.
Deane
's
*NL*
as
often
as
possible
,
instead
of
avoiding
that
,
as
he
used
to
do
.
At
*NL*
first
he
began
his
mornings
with
a
resolution
that
he
would
not
dine
*NL*
there
,
not
even
go
in
the
evening
,
till
Maggie
was
away
.
He
had
even
*NL*
devised
a
plan
of
starting
off
on
a
journey
in
this
agreeable
June
*NL*
weather
;
the
headaches
which
he
had
constantly
been
alleging
as
a
*NL*
ground
for
stupidity
and
silence
were
a
sufficient
ostensible
motive
.
*NL*
But
the
journey
was
not
taken
,
and
by
the
fourth
morning
no
distinct
*NL*
resolution
was
formed
about
the
evenings
;
they
were
only
foreseen
as
*NL*
times
when
Maggie
would
still
be
present
for
a
little
while
,
--
when
one
*NL*
more
touch
,
one
more
glance
,
might
be
snatched
.
For
why
not
?
There
was
*NL*
nothing
to
conceal
between
them
;
they
knew
,
they
had
confessed
their
*NL*
love
,
and
they
had
renounced
each
other
;
they
were
going
to
part
.
*NL*
Honor
and
conscience
were
going
to
divide
them
;
Maggie
,
with
that
*NL*
appeal
from
her
inmost
soul
,
had
decided
it
;
but
surely
they
might
*NL*
cast
a
lingering
look
at
each
other
across
the
gulf
,
before
they
*NL*
turned
away
never
to
look
again
till
that
strange
light
had
forever
*NL*
faded
out
of
their
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
,
all
this
time
,
moved
about
with
a
quiescence
and
even
torpor
*NL*
of
manner
,
so
contrasted
with
her
usual
fitful
brightness
and
ardor
,
*NL*
that
Lucy
would
have
had
to
seek
some
other
cause
for
such
a
change
,
*NL*
if
she
had
not
been
convinced
that
the
position
in
which
Maggie
stood
*NL*
between
Philip
and
her
brother
,
and
the
prospect
of
her
self-imposed
*NL*
wearisome
banishment
,
were
quite
enough
to
account
for
a
large
amount
*NL*
of
depression
.
But
under
this
torpor
there
was
a
fierce
battle
of
*NL*
emotions
,
such
as
Maggie
in
all
her
life
of
struggle
had
never
known
*NL*
or
foreboded
;
it
seemed
to
her
as
if
all
the
worst
evil
in
her
had
*NL*
lain
in
ambush
till
now
,
and
had
suddenly
started
up
full-armed
,
with
*NL*
hideous
,
overpowering
strength
!
There
were
moments
in
which
a
cruel
*NL*
selfishness
seemed
to
be
getting
possession
of
her
;
why
should
not
*NL*
Lucy
,
why
should
not
Philip
,
suffer
?
_
She
_
had
had
to
suffer
through
*NL*
many
years
of
her
life
;
and
who
had
renounced
anything
for
her
?
And
*NL*
when
something
like
that
fulness
of
existence
--
love
,
wealth
,
ease
,
*NL*
refinement
,
all
that
her
nature
craved
--
was
brought
within
her
reach
,
*NL*
why
was
she
to
forego
it
,
that
another
might
have
it
,
--
another
,
who
*NL*
perhaps
needed
it
less
?
But
amidst
all
this
new
passionate
tumult
*NL*
there
were
the
old
voices
making
themselves
heard
with
rising
power
,
*NL*
till
,
from
time
to
time
,
the
tumult
seemed
quelled
.
_
Was
_
that
*NL*
existence
which
tempted
her
the
full
existence
she
dreamed
?
Where
,
*NL*
then
,
would
be
all
the
memories
of
early
striving
;
all
the
deep
pity
*NL*
for
another
's
pain
,
which
had
been
nurtured
in
her
through
years
of
*NL*
affection
and
hardship
;
all
the
divine
presentiment
of
something
*NL*
higher
than
mere
personal
enjoyment
,
which
had
made
the
sacredness
of
*NL*
life
?
She
might
as
well
hope
to
enjoy
walking
by
maiming
her
feet
,
as
*NL*
hope
to
enjoy
an
existence
in
which
she
set
out
by
maiming
the
faith
*NL*
and
sympathy
that
were
the
best
organs
of
her
soul
.
And
then
,
if
pain
*NL*
were
so
hard
to
_
her
_
,
what
was
it
to
others
?
``
Ah
,
God
!
preserve
me
*NL*
from
inflicting
--
give
me
strength
to
bear
it
.
''
How
had
she
sunk
into
*NL*
this
struggle
with
a
temptation
that
she
would
once
have
thought
*NL*
herself
as
secure
from
as
from
deliberate
crime
?
When
was
that
first
*NL*
hateful
moment
in
which
she
had
been
conscious
of
a
feeling
that
*NL*
clashed
with
her
truth
,
affection
,
and
gratitude
,
and
had
not
shaken
*NL*
it
from
her
with
horror
,
as
if
it
had
been
a
loathsome
thing
?
And
yet
,
*NL*
since
this
strange
,
sweet
,
subduing
influence
did
not
,
should
not
,
*NL*
conquer
her
,
--
since
it
was
to
remain
simply
her
own
suffering
,
--
her
*NL*
mind
was
meeting
Stephen
's
in
that
thought
of
his
,
that
they
might
*NL*
still
snatch
moments
of
mute
confession
before
the
parting
came
.
For
*NL*
was
not
he
suffering
too
?
She
saw
it
daily
--
saw
it
in
the
sickened
*NL*
look
of
fatigue
with
which
,
as
soon
as
he
was
not
compelled
to
exert
*NL*
himself
,
he
relapsed
into
indifference
toward
everything
but
the
*NL*
possibility
of
watching
her
.
Could
she
refuse
sometimes
to
answer
that
*NL*
beseeching
look
which
she
felt
to
be
following
her
like
a
low
murmur
*NL*
of
love
and
pain
?
She
refused
it
less
and
less
,
till
at
last
the
*NL*
evening
for
them
both
was
sometimes
made
of
a
moment
's
mutual
gaze
;
*NL*
they
thought
of
it
till
it
came
,
and
when
it
had
come
,
they
thought
of
*NL*
nothing
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
other
thing
Stephen
seemed
now
and
then
to
care
for
,
and
that
was
*NL*
to
sing
;
it
was
a
way
of
speaking
to
Maggie
.
Perhaps
he
was
not
*NL*
distinctly
conscious
that
he
was
impelled
to
it
by
a
secret
*NL*
longing
--
running
counter
to
all
his
self-confessed
resolves
--
to
deepen
*NL*
the
hold
he
had
on
her
.
Watch
your
own
speech
,
and
notice
how
it
is
*NL*
guided
by
your
less
conscious
purposes
,
and
you
will
understand
that
*NL*
contradiction
in
Stephen
.
*NL*
*NL*
Philip
Wakem
was
a
less
frequent
visitor
,
but
he
came
occasionally
in
*NL*
the
evening
,
and
it
happened
that
he
was
there
when
Lucy
said
,
as
they
*NL*
sat
out
on
the
lawn
,
near
sunset
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
Maggie
's
tale
of
visits
to
aunt
Glegg
is
completed
,
I
mean
that
*NL*
we
shall
go
out
boating
every
day
until
she
goes
.
She
has
not
had
half
*NL*
enough
boating
because
of
these
tiresome
visits
,
and
she
likes
it
*NL*
better
than
anything
.
Do
n't
you
,
Maggie
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Better
than
any
sort
of
locomotion
,
I
hope
you
mean
,
''
said
Philip
,
*NL*
smiling
at
Maggie
,
who
was
lolling
backward
in
a
low
garden-chair
;
*NL*
``
else
she
will
be
selling
her
soul
to
that
ghostly
boatman
who
haunts
*NL*
the
Floss
,
only
for
the
sake
of
being
drifted
in
a
boat
forever
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Should
you
like
to
be
her
boatman
?
''
said
Lucy
.
``
Because
,
if
you
*NL*
would
,
you
can
come
with
us
and
take
an
oar
.
If
the
Floss
were
but
a
*NL*
quiet
lake
instead
of
a
river
,
we
should
be
independent
of
any
*NL*
gentleman
,
for
Maggie
can
row
splendidly
.
As
it
is
,
we
are
reduced
to
*NL*
ask
services
of
knights
and
squires
,
who
do
not
seem
to
offer
them
*NL*
with
great
alacrity
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
playful
reproach
at
Stephen
,
who
was
sauntering
up
and
*NL*
down
,
and
was
just
singing
in
pianissimo
falsetto
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
thirst
that
from
the
soul
doth
rise
*NL*
Doth
ask
a
drink
divine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
no
notice
,
but
still
kept
aloof
;
he
had
done
so
frequently
*NL*
during
Philip
's
recent
visits
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
seem
inclined
for
boating
,
''
said
Lucy
,
when
he
came
to
sit
*NL*
down
by
her
on
the
bench
.
``
Does
n't
rowing
suit
you
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
hate
a
large
party
in
a
boat
,
''
he
said
,
almost
irritably
.
``
I
'll
*NL*
come
when
you
have
no
one
else
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
colored
,
fearing
that
Philip
would
be
hurt
;
it
was
quite
a
new
*NL*
thing
for
Stephen
to
speak
in
that
way
;
but
he
had
certainly
not
been
*NL*
well
of
late
.
Philip
colored
too
,
but
less
from
a
feeling
of
personal
*NL*
offence
than
from
a
vague
suspicion
that
Stephen
's
moodiness
had
some
*NL*
relation
to
Maggie
,
who
had
started
up
from
her
chair
as
he
spoke
,
and
*NL*
had
walked
toward
the
hedge
of
laurels
to
look
at
the
descending
*NL*
sunlight
on
the
river
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
Miss
Deane
did
n't
know
she
was
excluding
others
by
inviting
me
,
''
*NL*
said
Philip
,
``
I
am
bound
to
resign
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
indeed
,
you
shall
not
,
''
said
Lucy
,
much
vexed
.
``
I
particularly
*NL*
wish
for
your
company
to-morrow
.
The
tide
will
suit
at
half-past
ten
;
*NL*
it
will
be
a
delicious
time
for
a
couple
of
hours
to
row
to
Luckreth
*NL*
and
walk
back
,
before
the
sun
gets
too
hot
.
And
how
can
you
object
to
*NL*
four
people
in
a
boat
?
''
she
added
,
looking
at
Stephen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
object
to
the
people
,
but
the
number
,
''
said
Stephen
,
who
had
*NL*
recovered
himself
,
and
was
rather
ashamed
of
his
rudeness
.
``
If
I
voted
*NL*
for
a
fourth
at
all
,
of
course
it
would
be
you
,
Phil
.
But
we
wo
n't
*NL*
divide
the
pleasure
of
escorting
the
ladies
;
we
'll
take
it
*NL*
alternately
.
I
'll
go
the
next
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
incident
had
the
effect
of
drawing
Philip
's
attention
with
*NL*
freshened
solicitude
toward
Stephen
and
Maggie
;
but
when
they
*NL*
re-entered
the
house
,
music
was
proposed
,
and
Mrs.
Tulliver
and
Mr.
*NL*
Deane
being
occupied
with
cribbage
,
Maggie
sat
apart
near
the
table
*NL*
where
the
books
and
work
were
placed
,
doing
nothing
,
however
,
but
*NL*
listening
abstractedly
to
the
music
.
Stephen
presently
turned
to
a
*NL*
duet
which
he
insisted
that
Lucy
and
Philip
should
sing
;
he
had
often
*NL*
done
the
same
thing
before
;
but
this
evening
Philip
thought
he
divined
*NL*
some
double
intention
in
every
word
and
look
of
Stephen
's
,
and
watched
*NL*
him
keenly
,
angry
with
himself
all
the
while
for
this
clinging
*NL*
suspicion
.
For
had
not
Maggie
virtually
denied
any
ground
for
his
*NL*
doubts
on
her
side
?
And
she
was
truth
itself
;
it
was
impossible
not
to
*NL*
believe
her
word
and
glance
when
they
had
last
spoken
together
in
the
*NL*
garden
.
Stephen
might
be
strongly
fascinated
by
her
-LRB-
what
was
more
*NL*
natural
?
-RRB-
,
but
Philip
felt
himself
rather
base
for
intruding
on
what
*NL*
must
be
his
friend
's
painful
secret
.
Still
he
watched
.
Stephen
,
moving
*NL*
away
from
the
piano
,
sauntered
slowly
toward
the
table
near
which
*NL*
Maggie
sat
,
and
turned
over
the
newspapers
,
apparently
in
mere
*NL*
idleness
.
Then
he
seated
himself
with
his
back
to
the
piano
,
dragging
*NL*
a
newspaper
under
his
elbow
,
and
thrusting
his
hand
through
his
hair
,
*NL*
as
if
he
had
been
attracted
by
some
bit
of
local
news
in
the
``
Laceham
*NL*
Courier
.
''
He
was
in
reality
looking
at
Maggie
who
had
not
taken
the
*NL*
slightest
notice
of
his
approach
.
She
had
always
additional
strength
*NL*
of
resistance
when
Philip
was
present
,
just
as
we
can
restrain
our
*NL*
speech
better
in
a
spot
that
we
feel
to
be
hallowed
.
But
at
last
she
*NL*
heard
the
word
``
dearest
''
uttered
in
the
softest
tone
of
pained
*NL*
entreaty
,
like
that
of
a
patient
who
asks
for
something
that
ought
to
*NL*
have
been
given
without
asking
.
She
had
never
heard
that
word
since
*NL*
the
moments
in
the
lane
at
Basset
,
when
it
had
come
from
Stephen
again
*NL*
and
again
,
almost
as
involuntarily
as
if
it
had
been
an
inarticulate
*NL*
cry
.
Philip
could
hear
no
word
,
but
he
had
moved
to
the
opposite
side
*NL*
of
the
piano
,
and
could
see
Maggie
start
and
blush
,
raise
her
eyes
an
*NL*
instant
toward
Stephen
's
face
,
but
immediately
look
apprehensively
*NL*
toward
himself
.
It
was
not
evident
to
her
that
Philip
had
observed
*NL*
her
;
but
a
pang
of
shame
,
under
the
sense
of
this
concealment
,
made
*NL*
her
move
from
her
chair
and
walk
to
her
mother
's
side
to
watch
the
*NL*
game
at
cribbage
.
*NL*
*NL*
Philip
went
home
soon
after
in
a
state
of
hideous
doubt
mingled
with
*NL*
wretched
certainty
.
It
was
impossible
for
him
now
to
resist
the
*NL*
conviction
that
there
was
some
mutual
consciousness
between
Stephen
*NL*
and
Maggie
;
and
for
half
the
night
his
irritable
,
susceptible
nerves
*NL*
were
pressed
upon
almost
to
frenzy
by
that
one
wretched
fact
;
he
could
*NL*
attempt
no
explanation
that
would
reconcile
it
with
her
words
and
*NL*
actions
.
When
,
at
last
,
the
need
for
belief
in
Maggie
rose
to
its
*NL*
habitual
predominance
,
he
was
not
long
in
imagining
the
truth
,
--
she
*NL*
was
struggling
,
she
was
banishing
herself
;
this
was
the
clue
to
all
he
*NL*
had
seen
since
his
return
.
But
athwart
that
belief
there
came
other
*NL*
possibilities
that
would
not
be
driven
out
of
sight
.
His
imagination
*NL*
wrought
out
the
whole
story
;
Stephen
was
madly
in
love
with
her
;
he
*NL*
must
have
told
her
so
;
she
had
rejected
him
,
and
was
hurrying
away
.
*NL*
But
would
he
give
her
up
,
knowing
--
Philip
felt
the
fact
with
*NL*
heart-crushing
despair
--
that
she
was
made
half
helpless
by
her
feeling
*NL*
toward
him
?
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
morning
came
,
Philip
was
too
ill
to
think
of
keeping
his
*NL*
engagement
to
go
in
the
boat
.
In
his
present
agitation
he
could
decide
*NL*
on
nothing
;
he
could
only
alternate
between
contradictory
intentions
.
*NL*
First
,
he
thought
he
must
have
an
interview
with
Maggie
,
and
entreat
*NL*
her
to
confide
in
him
;
then
,
again
,
he
distrusted
his
own
*NL*
interference
.
Had
he
not
been
thrusting
himself
on
Maggie
all
along
?
*NL*
She
had
uttered
words
long
ago
in
her
young
ignorance
;
it
was
enough
*NL*
to
make
her
hate
him
that
these
should
be
continually
present
with
her
*NL*
as
a
bond
.
And
had
he
any
right
to
ask
her
for
a
revelation
of
*NL*
feelings
which
she
had
evidently
intended
to
withhold
from
him
?
He
*NL*
would
not
trust
himself
to
see
her
,
till
he
had
assured
himself
that
*NL*
he
could
act
from
pure
anxiety
for
her
,
and
not
from
egoistic
*NL*
irritation
.
He
wrote
a
brief
note
to
Stephen
,
and
sent
it
early
by
the
*NL*
servant
,
saying
that
he
was
not
well
enough
to
fulfil
his
engagement
*NL*
to
Miss
Deane
.
Would
Stephen
take
his
excuse
,
and
fill
his
place
?
*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
had
arranged
a
charming
plan
,
which
had
made
her
quite
content
*NL*
with
Stephen
's
refusal
to
go
in
the
boat
.
She
discovered
that
her
*NL*
father
was
to
drive
to
Lindum
this
morning
at
ten
;
Lindum
was
the
very
*NL*
place
she
wanted
to
go
to
,
to
make
purchases
,
--
important
purchases
,
*NL*
which
must
by
no
means
be
put
off
to
another
opportunity
;
and
aunt
*NL*
Tulliver
must
go
too
,
because
she
was
concerned
in
some
of
the
*NL*
purchases
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
have
your
row
in
the
boat
just
the
same
,
you
know
,
''
she
said
*NL*
to
Maggie
when
they
went
out
of
the
breakfast-room
and
upstairs
*NL*
together
;
``
Philip
will
be
here
it
half-past
ten
,
and
it
is
a
delicious
*NL*
morning
.
Now
do
n't
say
a
word
against
it
,
you
dear
dolorous
thing
.
*NL*
What
is
the
use
of
my
being
a
fairy
godmother
,
if
you
set
your
face
*NL*
against
all
the
wonders
I
work
for
you
?
Do
n't
think
of
awful
cousin
*NL*
Tom
;
you
may
disobey
him
a
little
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
did
not
persist
in
objecting
.
She
was
almost
glad
of
the
plan
,
*NL*
for
perhaps
it
would
bring
her
some
strength
and
calmness
to
be
alone
*NL*
with
Philip
again
;
it
was
like
revisiting
the
scene
of
a
quieter
life
,
*NL*
in
which
the
very
struggles
were
repose
,
compared
with
the
daily
*NL*
tumult
of
the
present
.
She
prepared
herself
for
the
boat
and
at
*NL*
half-past
ten
sat
waiting
in
the
drawing-room
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
ring
of
the
door-bell
was
punctual
,
and
she
was
thinking
with
*NL*
half-sad
,
affectionate
pleasure
of
the
surprise
Philip
would
have
in
*NL*
finding
that
he
was
to
be
with
her
alone
,
when
she
distinguished
a
*NL*
firm
,
rapid
step
across
the
hall
,
that
was
certainly
not
Philip
's
;
the
*NL*
door
opened
,
and
Stephen
Guest
entered
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
first
moment
they
were
both
too
much
agitated
to
speak
;
for
*NL*
Stephen
had
learned
from
the
servant
that
the
others
were
gone
out
.
*NL*
Maggie
had
started
up
and
sat
down
again
,
with
her
heart
beating
*NL*
violently
;
and
Stephen
,
throwing
down
his
cap
and
gloves
,
came
and
sat
*NL*
by
her
in
silence
.
She
thought
Philip
would
be
coming
soon
;
and
with
*NL*
great
effort
--
for
she
trembled
visibly
--
she
rose
to
go
to
a
distant
*NL*
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
not
coming
,
''
said
Stephen
,
in
a
low
tone
.
``
I
am
going
in
the
*NL*
boat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
we
ca
n't
go
,
''
said
Maggie
,
sinking
into
her
chair
again
.
``
Lucy
*NL*
did
not
expect
--
she
would
be
hurt
.
Why
is
not
Philip
come
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
not
well
;
he
asked
me
to
come
instead
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lucy
is
gone
to
Lindum
,
''
said
Maggie
,
taking
off
her
bonnet
with
*NL*
hurried
,
trembling
fingers
.
``
We
must
not
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
''
said
Stephen
,
dreamily
,
looking
at
her
,
as
he
rested
his
*NL*
arm
on
the
back
of
his
chair
.
``
Then
we
'll
stay
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
looking
into
her
deep
,
deep
eyes
,
far
off
and
mysterious
at
the
*NL*
starlit
blackness
,
and
yet
very
near
,
and
timidly
loving
.
Maggie
sat
*NL*
perfectly
still
--
perhaps
for
moments
,
perhaps
for
minutes
--
until
the
*NL*
helpless
trembling
had
ceased
,
and
there
was
a
warm
glow
on
her
check
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
man
is
waiting
;
he
has
taken
the
cushions
,
''
she
said
.
``
Will
you
*NL*
go
and
tell
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
shall
I
tell
him
?
''
said
Stephen
,
almost
in
a
whisper
.
He
was
*NL*
looking
at
the
lips
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
made
no
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
go
,
''
Stephen
murmured
entreatingly
,
rising
,
and
taking
her
*NL*
hand
to
raise
her
too
.
``
We
shall
not
be
long
together
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
they
went
.
Maggie
felt
that
she
was
being
led
down
the
garden
*NL*
among
the
roses
,
being
helped
with
firm
,
tender
care
into
the
boat
,
*NL*
having
the
cushion
and
cloak
arranged
for
her
feet
,
and
her
parasol
*NL*
opened
for
her
-LRB-
which
she
had
forgotten
-RRB-
,
all
by
this
stronger
*NL*
presence
that
seemed
to
bear
her
along
without
any
act
of
her
own
*NL*
will
,
like
the
added
self
which
comes
with
the
sudden
exalting
*NL*
influence
of
a
strong
tonic
,
and
she
felt
nothing
else
.
Memory
was
*NL*
excluded
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
glided
rapidly
along
,
Stephen
rowing
,
helped
by
the
*NL*
backward-flowing
tide
,
past
the
Tofton
trees
and
houses
;
on
between
*NL*
the
silent
sunny
fields
and
pastures
,
which
seemed
filled
with
a
*NL*
natural
joy
that
had
no
reproach
for
theirs
.
The
breath
of
the
young
,
*NL*
unwearied
day
,
the
delicious
rhythmic
dip
of
the
oars
,
the
fragmentary
*NL*
song
of
a
passing
bird
heard
now
and
then
,
as
if
it
were
only
the
*NL*
overflowing
of
brimful
gladness
,
the
sweet
solitude
of
a
twofold
*NL*
consciousness
that
was
mingled
into
one
by
that
grave
,
untiring
gaze
*NL*
which
need
not
be
averted
,
--
what
else
could
there
be
in
their
minds
*NL*
for
the
first
hour
?
Some
low
,
subdued
,
languid
exclamation
of
love
*NL*
came
from
Stephen
from
time
to
time
,
as
he
went
on
rowing
idly
,
half
*NL*
automatically
;
otherwise
they
spoke
no
word
;
for
what
could
words
have
*NL*
been
but
an
inlet
to
thought
?
and
thought
did
not
belong
to
that
*NL*
enchanted
haze
in
which
they
were
enveloped
,
--
it
belonged
to
the
past
*NL*
and
the
future
that
lay
outside
the
haze
.
Maggie
was
only
dimly
*NL*
conscious
of
the
banks
,
as
they
passed
them
,
and
dwelt
with
no
*NL*
recognition
on
the
villages
;
she
knew
there
were
several
to
be
passed
*NL*
before
they
reached
Luckreth
,
where
they
always
stopped
and
left
the
*NL*
boat
.
At
all
times
she
was
so
liable
to
fits
of
absence
,
that
she
was
*NL*
likely
enough
to
let
her
waymarks
pass
unnoticed
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
at
last
Stephen
,
who
had
been
rowing
more
and
more
idly
,
ceased
to
*NL*
row
,
laid
down
the
oars
,
folded
his
arms
,
and
looked
down
on
the
water
*NL*
as
if
watching
the
pace
at
which
the
boat
glided
without
his
help
.
*NL*
This
sudden
change
roused
Maggie
.
She
looked
at
the
far-stretching
*NL*
fields
,
at
the
banks
close
by
,
and
felt
that
they
were
entirely
*NL*
strange
to
her
.
A
terrible
alarm
took
possession
of
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
have
we
passed
Luckreth
,
where
we
were
to
stop
?
''
she
exclaimed
,
*NL*
looking
back
to
see
if
the
place
were
out
of
sight
.
No
village
was
to
*NL*
be
seen
.
She
turned
around
again
,
with
a
look
of
distressed
*NL*
questioning
at
Stephen
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
on
watching
the
water
,
and
said
,
in
a
strange
,
dreamy
,
absent
*NL*
tone
,
``
Yes
,
a
long
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
what
shall
I
do
?
''
cried
Maggie
,
in
an
agony
.
``
We
shall
not
get
*NL*
home
for
hours
,
and
Lucy
?
O
God
,
help
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
clasped
her
hands
and
broke
into
a
sob
,
like
a
frightened
child
;
*NL*
she
thought
of
nothing
but
of
meeting
Lucy
,
and
seeing
her
look
of
*NL*
pained
surprise
and
doubt
,
perhaps
of
just
upbraiding
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
moved
and
sat
near
her
,
and
gently
drew
down
the
clasped
*NL*
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Maggie
,
''
he
said
,
in
a
deep
tone
of
slow
decision
,
``
let
us
never
go
*NL*
home
again
,
till
no
one
can
part
us
,
--
till
we
are
married
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
unusual
tone
,
the
startling
words
,
arrested
Maggie
's
sob
,
and
she
*NL*
sat
quite
still
,
wondering
;
as
if
Stephen
might
have
seen
some
*NL*
possibilities
that
would
alter
everything
,
and
annul
the
wretched
*NL*
facts
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
See
,
Maggie
,
how
everything
has
come
without
our
seeking
,
--
in
spite
*NL*
of
all
our
efforts
.
We
never
thought
of
being
alone
together
again
;
it
*NL*
has
all
been
done
by
others
.
See
how
the
tide
is
carrying
us
out
,
away
*NL*
from
all
those
unnatural
bonds
that
we
have
been
trying
to
make
faster
*NL*
round
us
,
and
trying
in
vain
.
It
will
carry
us
on
to
Torby
,
and
we
can
*NL*
land
there
,
and
get
some
carriage
,
and
hurry
on
to
York
and
then
to
*NL*
Scotland
,
--
and
never
pause
a
moment
till
we
are
bound
to
each
other
,
*NL*
so
that
only
death
can
part
us
.
It
is
the
only
right
thing
,
dearest
;
*NL*
it
is
the
only
way
of
escaping
from
this
wretched
entanglement
.
*NL*
Everything
has
concurred
to
point
it
out
to
us
.
We
have
contrived
*NL*
nothing
,
we
have
thought
of
nothing
ourselves
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
spoke
with
deep
,
earnest
pleading
.
Maggie
listened
,
passing
*NL*
from
her
startled
wonderment
to
the
yearning
after
that
belief
that
*NL*
the
tide
was
doing
it
all
,
that
she
might
glide
along
with
the
swift
,
*NL*
silent
stream
,
and
not
struggle
any
more
.
But
across
that
stealing
*NL*
influence
came
the
terrible
shadow
of
past
thoughts
;
and
the
sudden
*NL*
horror
lest
now
,
at
last
,
the
moment
of
fatal
intoxication
was
close
*NL*
upon
her
,
called
up
feelings
of
angry
resistance
toward
Stephen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
go
!
''
she
said
,
in
an
agitated
tone
,
flashing
an
indignant
look
*NL*
at
him
,
and
trying
to
get
her
hands
free
.
``
You
have
wanted
to
deprive
*NL*
me
of
any
choice
.
You
knew
we
were
come
too
far
;
you
have
dared
to
*NL*
take
advantage
of
my
thoughtlessness
.
It
is
unmanly
to
bring
me
into
*NL*
such
a
position
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Stung
by
this
reproach
,
he
released
her
hands
,
moved
back
to
his
*NL*
former
place
,
and
folded
his
arms
,
in
a
sort
of
desperation
at
the
*NL*
difficulty
Maggie
's
words
had
made
present
to
him
.
If
she
would
not
*NL*
consent
to
go
on
,
he
must
curse
himself
for
the
embarrassment
he
had
*NL*
led
her
into
.
But
the
reproach
was
the
unendurable
thing
;
the
one
*NL*
thing
worse
than
parting
with
her
was
,
that
she
should
feel
he
had
*NL*
acted
unworthily
toward
her
.
At
last
he
said
,
in
a
tone
of
suppressed
*NL*
rage
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
notice
that
we
had
passed
Luckreth
till
we
had
got
to
the
*NL*
next
village
;
and
then
it
came
into
my
mind
that
we
would
go
on
.
I
*NL*
ca
n't
justify
it
;
I
ought
to
have
told
you
.
It
is
enough
to
make
you
*NL*
hate
me
,
since
you
do
n't
love
me
well
enough
to
make
everything
else
*NL*
indifferent
to
you
,
as
I
do
you
.
Shall
I
stop
the
boat
and
try
to
get
*NL*
you
out
here
?
I
'll
tell
Lucy
that
I
was
mad
,
and
that
you
hate
me
;
and
*NL*
you
shall
be
clear
of
me
forever
.
No
one
can
blame
you
,
because
I
have
*NL*
behaved
unpardonably
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
was
paralyzed
;
it
was
easier
to
resist
Stephen
's
pleading
than
*NL*
this
picture
he
had
called
up
of
himself
suffering
while
she
was
*NL*
vindicated
;
easier
even
to
turn
away
from
his
look
of
tenderness
than
*NL*
from
this
look
of
angry
misery
,
that
seemed
to
place
her
in
selfish
*NL*
isolation
from
him
.
He
had
called
up
a
state
of
feeling
in
which
the
*NL*
reasons
which
had
acted
on
her
conscience
seemed
to
be
transmitted
*NL*
into
mere
self-regard
.
The
indignant
fire
in
her
eyes
was
quenched
,
*NL*
and
she
began
to
look
at
him
with
timid
distress
.
She
had
reproached
*NL*
him
for
being
hurried
into
irrevocable
trespass
,
--
she
,
who
had
been
so
*NL*
weak
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
if
I
should
n't
feel
what
happened
to
you
--
just
the
same
,
''
she
*NL*
said
,
with
reproach
of
another
kind
,
--
the
reproach
of
love
,
asking
for
*NL*
more
trust
.
This
yielding
to
the
idea
of
Stephen
's
suffering
was
more
*NL*
fatal
than
the
other
yielding
,
because
it
was
less
distinguishable
*NL*
from
that
sense
of
others
'
claims
which
was
the
moral
basis
of
her
*NL*
resistance
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
felt
all
the
relenting
in
her
look
and
tone
;
it
was
heaven
opening
*NL*
again
.
He
moved
to
her
side
,
and
took
her
hand
,
leaning
his
elbow
on
*NL*
the
back
of
the
boat
,
and
saying
nothing
.
He
dreaded
to
utter
another
*NL*
word
,
he
dreaded
to
make
another
movement
,
that
might
provoke
another
*NL*
reproach
or
denial
from
her
.
Life
hung
on
her
consent
;
everything
else
*NL*
was
hopeless
,
confused
,
sickening
misery
.
They
glided
along
in
this
*NL*
way
,
both
resting
in
that
silence
as
in
a
haven
,
both
dreading
lest
*NL*
their
feelings
should
be
divided
again
,
--
till
they
became
aware
that
*NL*
the
clouds
had
gathered
,
and
that
the
slightest
perceptible
freshening
*NL*
of
the
breeze
was
growing
and
growing
,
so
that
the
whole
character
of
*NL*
the
day
was
altered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
be
chill
,
Maggie
,
in
this
thin
dress
.
Let
me
raise
the
cloak
*NL*
over
your
shoulders
.
Get
up
an
instant
,
dearest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
obeyed
;
there
was
an
unspeakable
charm
in
being
told
what
to
*NL*
do
,
and
having
everything
decided
for
her
.
She
sat
down
again
covered
*NL*
with
the
cloak
,
and
Stephen
took
to
his
oars
again
,
making
haste
;
for
*NL*
they
must
try
to
get
to
Torby
as
fast
as
they
could
.
Maggie
was
hardly
*NL*
conscious
of
having
said
or
done
anything
decisive
.
All
yielding
is
*NL*
attended
with
a
less
vivid
consciousness
than
resistance
;
it
is
the
*NL*
partial
sleep
of
thought
;
it
is
the
submergence
of
our
own
personality
*NL*
by
another
.
Every
influence
tended
to
lull
her
into
acquiescence
.
That
*NL*
dreamy
gliding
in
the
boat
which
had
lasted
for
four
hours
,
and
had
*NL*
brought
some
weariness
and
exhaustion
;
the
recoil
of
her
fatigued
*NL*
sensations
from
the
impracticable
difficulty
of
getting
out
of
the
*NL*
boat
at
this
unknown
distance
from
home
,
and
walking
for
long
*NL*
miles
,
--
all
helped
to
bring
her
into
more
complete
subjection
to
that
*NL*
strong
,
mysterious
charm
which
made
a
last
parting
from
Stephen
seem
*NL*
the
death
of
all
joy
,
and
made
the
thought
of
wounding
him
like
the
*NL*
first
touch
of
the
torturing
iron
before
which
resolution
shrank
.
And
*NL*
then
there
was
the
present
happiness
of
being
with
him
,
which
was
*NL*
enough
to
absorb
all
her
languid
energy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Presently
Stephen
observed
a
vessel
coming
after
them
.
Several
*NL*
vessels
,
among
them
the
steamer
to
Mudport
,
had
passed
them
with
the
*NL*
early
tide
,
but
for
the
last
hour
they
had
seen
none
.
He
looked
more
*NL*
and
more
eagerly
at
this
vessel
,
as
if
a
new
thought
had
come
into
his
*NL*
mind
along
with
it
,
and
then
he
looked
at
Maggie
hesitatingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Maggie
,
dearest
,
''
he
said
at
last
,
``
if
this
vessel
should
be
going
to
*NL*
Mudport
,
or
to
any
convenient
place
on
the
coast
northward
,
it
would
*NL*
be
our
best
plan
to
get
them
to
take
us
on
board
.
You
are
fatigued
,
*NL*
and
it
may
soon
rain
;
it
may
be
a
wretched
business
,
getting
to
Torby
*NL*
in
this
boat
.
It
's
only
a
trading
vessel
,
but
I
dare
say
you
can
be
*NL*
made
tolerably
comfortable
.
We
'll
take
the
cushions
out
of
the
boat
.
*NL*
It
is
really
our
best
plan
.
They
'll
be
glad
enough
to
take
us
.
I
've
*NL*
got
plenty
of
money
about
me
.
I
can
pay
them
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
's
heart
began
to
beat
with
reawakened
alarm
at
this
new
*NL*
proposition
;
but
she
was
silent
,
--
one
course
seemed
as
difficult
as
*NL*
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
hailed
the
vessel
.
It
was
a
Dutch
vessel
going
to
Mudport
,
the
*NL*
English
mate
informed
him
,
and
,
if
this
wind
held
,
would
be
there
in
*NL*
less
than
two
days
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
had
got
out
too
far
with
our
boat
,
''
said
Stephen
.
``
I
was
trying
to
*NL*
make
for
Torby
.
But
I
'm
afraid
of
the
weather
;
and
this
lady
--
my
*NL*
wife
--
will
be
exhausted
with
fatigue
and
hunger
.
Take
us
on
*NL*
board
--
will
you
?
--
and
haul
up
the
boat
.
I
'll
pay
you
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
,
now
really
faint
and
trembling
with
fear
,
was
taken
on
board
,
*NL*
making
an
interesting
object
of
contemplation
to
admiring
Dutchmen
.
*NL*
The
mate
feared
the
lady
would
have
a
poor
time
of
it
on
board
,
for
*NL*
they
had
no
accommodation
for
such
entirely
unlooked-for
*NL*
passengers
,
--
no
private
cabin
larger
than
an
old-fashioned
church-pew
.
*NL*
But
at
least
they
had
Dutch
cleanliness
,
which
makes
all
other
*NL*
inconveniences
tolerable
;
and
the
boat
cushions
were
spread
into
a
*NL*
couch
for
Maggie
on
the
poop
with
all
alacrity
.
But
to
pace
up
and
*NL*
down
the
deck
leaning
on
Stephen
--
being
upheld
by
his
strength
--
was
*NL*
the
first
change
that
she
needed
;
then
came
food
,
and
then
quiet
*NL*
reclining
on
the
cushions
,
with
the
sense
that
no
new
resolution
*NL*
_
could
_
be
taken
that
day
.
Everything
must
wait
till
to-morrow
.
*NL*
Stephen
sat
beside
her
with
her
hand
in
his
;
they
could
only
speak
to
*NL*
each
other
in
low
tones
;
only
look
at
each
other
now
and
then
,
for
it
*NL*
would
take
a
long
while
to
dull
the
curiosity
of
the
five
men
on
*NL*
board
,
and
reduce
these
handsome
young
strangers
to
that
minor
degree
*NL*
of
interest
which
belongs
,
in
a
sailor
's
regard
,
to
all
objects
nearer
*NL*
than
the
horizon
.
But
Stephen
was
triumphantly
happy
.
Every
other
*NL*
thought
or
care
was
thrown
into
unmarked
perspective
by
the
certainty
*NL*
that
Maggie
must
be
his
.
The
leap
had
been
taken
now
;
he
had
been
*NL*
tortured
by
scruples
,
he
had
fought
fiercely
with
overmastering
*NL*
inclination
,
he
had
hesitated
;
but
repentance
was
impossible
.
He
*NL*
murmured
forth
in
fragmentary
sentences
his
happiness
,
his
adoration
,
*NL*
his
tenderness
,
his
belief
that
their
life
together
must
be
heaven
,
*NL*
that
her
presence
with
him
would
give
rapture
to
every
common
day
;
*NL*
that
to
satisfy
her
lightest
wish
was
dearer
to
him
than
all
other
*NL*
bliss
;
that
everything
was
easy
for
her
sake
,
except
to
part
with
her
;
*NL*
and
now
they
never
_
would
_
part
;
he
would
belong
to
her
forever
,
and
*NL*
all
that
was
his
was
hers
,
--
had
no
value
for
him
except
as
it
was
*NL*
hers
.
Such
things
,
uttered
in
low
,
broken
tones
by
the
one
voice
that
*NL*
has
first
stirred
the
fibre
of
young
passion
,
have
only
a
feeble
*NL*
effect
--
on
experienced
minds
at
a
distance
from
them
.
To
poor
Maggie
*NL*
they
were
very
near
;
they
were
like
nectar
held
close
to
thirsty
lips
;
*NL*
there
was
,
there
_
must
_
be
,
then
,
a
life
for
mortals
here
below
which
*NL*
was
not
hard
and
chill
,
--
in
which
affection
would
no
longer
be
*NL*
self-sacrifice
.
Stephen
's
passionate
words
made
the
vision
of
such
a
*NL*
life
more
fully
present
to
her
than
it
had
ever
been
before
;
and
the
*NL*
vision
for
the
time
excluded
all
realities
,
--
all
except
the
returning
*NL*
sun-gleams
which
broke
out
on
the
waters
as
the
evening
approached
,
*NL*
and
mingled
with
the
visionary
sunlight
of
promised
happiness
;
all
*NL*
except
the
hand
that
pressed
hers
,
and
the
voice
that
spoke
to
her
,
*NL*
and
the
eyes
that
looked
at
her
with
grave
,
unspeakable
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
to
be
no
rain
,
after
all
;
the
clouds
rolled
off
to
the
*NL*
horizon
again
,
making
the
great
purple
rampart
and
long
purple
isles
*NL*
of
that
wondrous
land
which
reveals
itself
to
us
when
the
sun
goes
*NL*
down
,
--
the
land
that
the
evening
star
watches
over
.
Maggie
was
to
*NL*
sleep
all
night
on
the
poop
;
it
was
better
than
going
below
;
and
she
*NL*
was
covered
with
the
warmest
wrappings
the
ship
could
furnish
.
It
was
*NL*
still
early
,
when
the
fatigues
of
the
day
brought
on
a
drowsy
longing
*NL*
for
perfect
rest
,
and
she
laid
down
her
head
,
looking
at
the
faint
,
*NL*
dying
flush
in
the
west
,
where
the
one
golden
lamp
was
getting
*NL*
brighter
and
brighter
.
Then
she
looked
up
at
Stephen
,
who
was
still
*NL*
seated
by
her
,
hanging
over
her
as
he
leaned
his
arm
against
the
*NL*
vessel
's
side
.
Behind
all
the
delicious
visions
of
these
last
hours
,
*NL*
which
had
flowed
over
her
like
a
soft
stream
,
and
made
her
entirely
*NL*
passive
,
there
was
the
dim
consciousness
that
the
condition
was
a
*NL*
transient
one
,
and
that
the
morrow
must
bring
back
the
old
life
of
*NL*
struggle
;
that
there
were
thoughts
which
would
presently
avenge
*NL*
themselves
for
this
oblivion
.
But
now
nothing
was
distinct
to
her
;
she
*NL*
was
being
lulled
to
sleep
with
that
soft
stream
still
flowing
over
*NL*
her
,
with
those
delicious
visions
melting
and
fading
like
the
wondrous
*NL*
aerial
land
of
the
west
.

Chapter
XIV
*NL*
*NL*
Waking
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
Maggie
was
gone
to
sleep
,
Stephen
,
weary
too
with
his
*NL*
unaccustomed
amount
of
rowing
,
and
with
the
intense
inward
life
of
the
*NL*
last
twelve
hours
,
but
too
restless
to
sleep
,
walked
and
lounged
about
*NL*
the
deck
with
his
cigar
far
on
into
midnight
,
not
seeing
the
dark
*NL*
water
,
hardly
conscious
there
were
stars
,
living
only
in
the
near
and
*NL*
distant
future
.
At
last
fatigue
conquered
restlessness
,
and
he
rolled
*NL*
himself
up
in
a
piece
of
tarpaulin
on
the
deck
near
Maggie
's
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
fallen
asleep
before
nine
,
and
had
been
sleeping
for
six
hours
*NL*
before
the
faintest
hint
of
a
midsummer
daybreak
was
discernible
.
She
*NL*
awoke
from
that
vivid
dreaming
which
makes
the
margin
of
our
deeper
*NL*
rest
.
She
was
in
a
boat
on
the
wide
water
with
Stephen
,
and
in
the
*NL*
gathering
darkness
something
like
a
star
appeared
,
that
grew
and
grew
*NL*
till
they
saw
it
was
the
Virgin
seated
in
St.
Ogg
's
boat
,
and
it
came
*NL*
nearer
and
nearer
,
till
they
saw
the
Virgin
was
Lucy
and
the
boatman
*NL*
was
Philip
,
--
no
,
not
Philip
,
but
her
brother
,
who
rowed
past
without
*NL*
looking
at
her
;
and
she
rose
to
stretch
out
her
arms
and
call
to
him
,
*NL*
and
their
own
boat
turned
over
with
the
movement
,
and
they
began
to
*NL*
sink
,
till
with
one
spasm
of
dread
she
seemed
to
awake
,
and
find
she
*NL*
was
a
child
again
in
the
parlor
at
evening
twilight
,
and
Tom
was
not
*NL*
really
angry
.
From
the
soothed
sense
of
that
false
waking
she
passed
*NL*
to
the
real
waking
,
--
to
the
plash
of
water
against
the
vessel
,
and
the
*NL*
sound
of
a
footstep
on
the
deck
,
and
the
awful
starlit
sky
.
There
was
*NL*
a
moment
of
utter
bewilderment
before
her
mind
could
get
disentangled
*NL*
from
the
confused
web
of
dreams
;
but
soon
the
whole
terrible
truth
*NL*
urged
itself
upon
her
.
Stephen
was
not
by
her
now
;
she
was
alone
with
*NL*
her
own
memory
and
her
own
dread
.
The
irrevocable
wrong
that
must
blot
*NL*
her
life
had
been
committed
;
she
had
brought
sorrow
into
the
lives
of
*NL*
others
,
--
into
the
lives
that
were
knit
up
with
hers
by
trust
and
love
.
*NL*
The
feeling
of
a
few
short
weeks
had
hurried
her
into
the
sins
her
*NL*
nature
had
most
recoiled
from
,
--
breach
of
faith
and
cruel
selfishness
;
*NL*
she
had
rent
the
ties
that
had
given
meaning
to
duty
,
and
had
made
*NL*
herself
an
outlawed
soul
,
with
no
guide
but
the
wayward
choice
of
her
*NL*
own
passion
.
And
where
would
that
lead
her
?
Where
had
it
led
her
now
?
*NL*
She
had
said
she
would
rather
die
than
fall
into
that
temptation
.
She
*NL*
felt
it
now
,
--
now
that
the
consequences
of
such
a
fall
had
come
before
*NL*
the
outward
act
was
completed
.
There
was
at
least
this
fruit
from
all
*NL*
her
years
of
striving
after
the
highest
and
best
,
--
that
her
soul
*NL*
though
betrayed
,
beguiled
,
ensnared
,
could
never
deliberately
consent
*NL*
to
a
choice
of
the
lower
.
And
a
choice
of
what
?
O
God
!
not
a
choice
of
*NL*
joy
,
but
of
conscious
cruelty
and
hardness
;
for
could
she
ever
cease
*NL*
to
see
before
her
Lucy
and
Philip
,
with
their
murdered
trust
and
*NL*
hopes
?
Her
life
with
Stephen
could
have
no
sacredness
;
she
must
*NL*
forever
sink
and
wander
vaguely
,
driven
by
uncertain
impulse
;
for
she
*NL*
had
let
go
the
clue
of
life
,
--
that
clue
which
once
in
the
far-off
*NL*
years
her
young
need
had
clutched
so
strongly
.
She
had
renounced
all
*NL*
delights
then
,
before
she
knew
them
,
before
they
had
come
within
her
*NL*
reach
.
Philip
had
been
right
when
he
told
her
that
she
knew
nothing
of
*NL*
renunciation
;
she
had
thought
it
was
quiet
ecstasy
;
she
saw
it
face
to
*NL*
face
now
,
--
that
sad
,
patient
,
loving
strength
which
holds
the
clue
of
*NL*
life
,
--
and
saw
that
the
thorns
were
forever
pressing
on
its
brow
.
The
*NL*
yesterday
,
which
could
never
be
revoked
,
--
if
she
could
have
changed
it
*NL*
now
for
any
length
of
inward
silent
endurance
,
she
would
have
bowed
*NL*
beneath
that
cross
with
a
sense
of
rest
.
*NL*
*NL*
Day
break
came
and
the
reddening
eastern
light
,
while
her
past
life
*NL*
was
grasping
her
in
this
way
,
with
that
tightening
clutch
which
comes
*NL*
in
the
last
moments
of
possible
rescue
.
She
could
see
Stephen
now
*NL*
lying
on
the
deck
still
fast
asleep
,
and
with
the
sight
of
him
there
*NL*
came
a
wave
of
anguish
that
found
its
way
in
a
long-suppressed
sob
.
*NL*
The
worst
bitterness
of
parting
--
the
thought
that
urged
the
sharpest
*NL*
inward
cry
for
help
--
was
the
pain
it
must
give
to
_
him
_
.
But
*NL*
surmounting
everything
was
the
horror
at
her
own
possible
failure
,
the
*NL*
dread
lest
her
conscience
should
be
benumbed
again
,
and
not
rise
to
*NL*
energy
till
it
was
too
late
.
Too
late
!
it
was
too
late
already
not
to
*NL*
have
caused
misery
;
too
late
for
everything
,
perhaps
,
but
to
rush
away
*NL*
from
the
last
act
of
baseness
,
--
the
tasting
of
joys
that
were
wrung
*NL*
from
crushed
hearts
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sun
was
rising
now
,
and
Maggie
started
up
with
the
sense
that
a
*NL*
day
of
resistance
was
beginning
for
her
.
Her
eyelashes
were
still
wet
*NL*
with
tears
,
as
,
with
her
shawl
over
her
head
,
she
sat
looking
at
the
*NL*
slowly
rounding
sun
.
Something
roused
Stephen
too
,
and
getting
up
from
*NL*
his
hard
bed
,
he
came
to
sit
beside
her
.
The
sharp
instinct
of
anxious
*NL*
love
saw
something
to
give
him
alarm
in
the
very
first
glance
.
He
had
*NL*
a
hovering
dread
of
some
resistance
in
Maggie
's
nature
that
he
would
*NL*
be
unable
to
overcome
.
He
had
the
uneasy
consciousness
that
he
had
*NL*
robbed
her
of
perfect
freedom
yesterday
;
there
was
too
much
native
*NL*
honor
in
him
,
for
him
not
to
feel
that
,
if
her
will
should
recoil
,
his
*NL*
conduct
would
have
been
odious
,
and
she
would
have
a
right
to
reproach
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Maggie
did
not
feel
that
right
;
she
was
too
conscious
of
fatal
*NL*
weakness
in
herself
,
too
full
of
the
tenderness
that
comes
with
the
*NL*
foreseen
need
for
inflicting
a
wound
.
She
let
him
take
her
hand
when
*NL*
he
came
to
sit
down
beside
her
,
and
smiled
at
him
,
only
with
rather
a
*NL*
sad
glance
;
she
could
say
nothing
to
pain
him
till
the
moment
of
*NL*
possible
parting
was
nearer
.
And
so
they
drank
their
cup
of
coffee
*NL*
together
,
and
walked
about
the
deck
,
and
heard
the
captain
's
assurance
*NL*
that
they
should
be
in
at
Mudport
by
five
o'clock
,
each
with
an
inward
*NL*
burthen
;
but
in
him
it
was
an
undefined
fear
,
which
he
trusted
to
the
*NL*
coming
hours
to
dissipate
;
in
her
it
was
a
definite
resolve
on
which
*NL*
she
was
trying
silently
to
tighten
her
hold
.
Stephen
was
continually
,
*NL*
through
the
morning
,
expressing
his
anxiety
at
the
fatigue
and
*NL*
discomfort
she
was
suffering
,
and
alluded
to
landing
and
to
the
change
*NL*
of
motion
and
repose
she
would
have
in
a
carriage
,
wanting
to
assure
*NL*
himself
more
completely
by
presupposing
that
everything
would
be
as
he
*NL*
had
arranged
it
.
For
a
long
while
Maggie
contented
herself
with
*NL*
assuring
him
that
she
had
had
a
good
night
's
rest
,
and
that
she
did
n't
*NL*
mind
about
being
on
the
vessel
,
--
it
was
not
like
being
on
the
open
*NL*
sea
,
it
was
only
a
little
less
pleasant
than
being
in
a
boat
on
the
*NL*
Floss
.
But
a
suppressed
resolve
will
betray
itself
in
the
eyes
,
and
*NL*
Stephen
became
more
and
more
uneasy
as
the
day
advanced
,
under
the
*NL*
sense
that
Maggie
had
entirely
lost
her
passiveness
.
He
longed
,
but
*NL*
did
not
dare
,
to
speak
of
their
marriage
,
of
where
they
would
go
after
*NL*
it
,
and
the
steps
he
would
take
to
inform
his
father
,
and
the
rest
,
of
*NL*
what
had
happened
.
He
longed
to
assure
himself
of
a
tacit
assent
from
*NL*
her
.
But
each
time
he
looked
at
her
,
he
gathered
a
stronger
dread
of
*NL*
the
new
,
quiet
sadness
with
which
she
met
his
eyes
.
And
they
were
more
*NL*
and
more
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
we
are
in
sight
of
Mudport
,
''
he
said
at
last
.
``
Now
,
dearest
,
''
he
*NL*
added
,
turning
toward
her
with
a
look
that
was
half
beseeching
,
``
the
*NL*
worst
part
of
your
fatigue
is
over
.
On
the
land
we
can
command
*NL*
swiftness
.
In
another
hour
and
a
half
we
shall
be
in
a
chaise
*NL*
together
,
and
that
will
seem
rest
to
you
after
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
felt
it
was
time
to
speak
;
it
would
only
be
unkind
now
to
*NL*
assent
by
silence
.
She
spoke
in
the
lowest
tone
,
as
he
had
done
,
but
*NL*
with
distinct
decision
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
shall
not
be
together
;
we
shall
have
parted
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
blood
rushed
to
Stephen
's
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
shall
not
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
'll
die
first
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
as
he
had
dreaded
--
there
was
a
struggle
coming
.
But
neither
of
*NL*
them
dared
to
say
another
word
till
the
boat
was
let
down
,
and
they
*NL*
were
taken
to
the
landing-place
.
Here
there
was
a
cluster
of
gazers
*NL*
and
passengers
awaiting
the
departure
of
the
steamboat
to
St.
Ogg
's
.
*NL*
Maggie
had
a
dim
sense
,
when
she
had
landed
,
and
Stephen
was
hurrying
*NL*
her
along
on
his
arm
,
that
some
one
had
advanced
toward
her
from
that
*NL*
cluster
as
if
he
were
coming
to
speak
to
her
.
But
she
was
hurried
*NL*
along
,
and
was
indifferent
to
everything
but
the
coming
trial
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
porter
guided
them
to
the
nearest
inn
and
posting-house
,
and
Stephen
*NL*
gave
the
order
for
the
chaise
as
they
passed
through
the
yard
.
Maggie
*NL*
took
no
notice
of
this
,
and
only
said
,
``
Ask
them
to
show
us
into
a
*NL*
room
where
we
can
sit
down
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
entered
,
Maggie
did
not
sit
down
,
and
Stephen
,
whose
face
*NL*
had
a
desperate
determination
in
it
,
was
about
to
ring
the
bell
,
when
*NL*
she
said
,
in
a
firm
voice
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
going
;
we
must
part
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Maggie
,
''
he
said
,
turning
round
toward
her
,
and
speaking
in
the
tones
*NL*
of
a
man
who
feels
a
process
of
torture
beginning
,
``
do
you
mean
to
*NL*
kill
me
?
What
is
the
use
of
it
now
?
The
whole
thing
is
done
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
it
is
not
done
,
''
said
Maggie
.
``
Too
much
is
done
,
--
more
than
we
*NL*
can
ever
remove
the
trace
of
.
But
I
will
go
no
farther
.
Do
n't
try
to
*NL*
prevail
with
me
again
.
I
could
n't
choose
yesterday
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
What
was
he
to
do
?
He
dared
not
go
near
her
;
her
anger
might
leap
out
,
*NL*
and
make
a
new
barrier
.
He
walked
backward
and
forward
in
maddening
*NL*
perplexity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Maggie
,
''
he
said
at
last
,
pausing
before
her
,
and
speaking
in
a
tone
*NL*
of
imploring
wretchedness
,
``
have
some
pity
--
hear
me
--
forgive
me
for
*NL*
what
I
did
yesterday
.
I
will
obey
you
now
;
I
will
do
nothing
without
*NL*
your
full
consent
.
But
do
n't
blight
our
lives
forever
by
a
rash
*NL*
perversity
that
can
answer
no
good
purpose
to
any
one
,
that
can
only
*NL*
create
new
evils
.
Sit
down
,
dearest
;
wait
--
think
what
you
are
going
to
*NL*
do
.
Do
n't
treat
me
as
if
you
could
n't
trust
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
chosen
the
most
effective
appeal
;
but
Maggie
's
will
was
fixed
*NL*
unswervingly
on
the
coming
wrench
.
She
had
made
up
her
mind
to
suffer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
must
not
wait
,
''
she
said
,
in
a
low
but
distinct
voice
;
``
we
must
*NL*
part
at
once
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
_
ca
n't
_
part
,
Maggie
,
''
said
Stephen
,
more
impetuously
.
``
I
ca
n't
*NL*
bear
it
.
What
is
the
use
of
inflicting
that
misery
on
me
?
The
*NL*
blow
--
whatever
it
may
have
been
--
has
been
struck
now
.
Will
it
help
any
*NL*
one
else
that
you
should
drive
me
mad
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
not
begin
any
future
,
even
for
you
,
''
said
Maggie
,
tremulously
,
*NL*
``
with
a
deliberate
consent
to
what
ought
not
to
have
been
.
What
I
told
*NL*
you
at
Basset
I
feel
now
;
I
would
rather
have
died
than
fall
into
this
*NL*
temptation
.
It
would
have
been
better
if
we
had
parted
forever
then
.
*NL*
But
we
must
part
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
will
_
not
_
part
,
''
Stephen
burst
out
,
instinctively
placing
his
*NL*
back
against
the
door
,
forgetting
everything
he
had
said
a
few
moments
*NL*
before
;
``
I
will
not
endure
it
.
You
'll
make
me
desperate
;
I
sha
'n'
t
*NL*
know
what
I
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
trembled
.
She
felt
that
the
parting
could
not
be
effected
*NL*
suddenly
.
She
must
rely
on
a
slower
appeal
to
Stephen
's
better
self
;
*NL*
she
must
be
prepared
for
a
harder
task
than
that
of
rushing
away
while
*NL*
resolution
was
fresh
.
She
sat
down
.
Stephen
,
watching
her
with
that
*NL*
look
of
desperation
which
had
come
over
him
like
a
lurid
light
,
*NL*
approached
slowly
from
the
door
,
seated
himself
close
beside
her
,
and
*NL*
grasped
her
hand
.
Her
heart
beat
like
the
heart
of
a
frightened
bird
;
*NL*
but
this
direct
opposition
helped
her
.
She
felt
her
determination
*NL*
growing
stronger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Remember
what
you
felt
weeks
ago
,
''
she
began
,
with
beseeching
*NL*
earnestness
;
``
remember
what
we
both
felt
,
--
that
we
owed
ourselves
to
*NL*
others
,
and
must
conquer
every
inclination
which
could
make
us
false
*NL*
to
that
debt
.
We
have
failed
to
keep
our
resolutions
;
but
the
wrong
*NL*
remains
the
same
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
it
does
_
not
_
remain
the
same
,
''
said
Stephen
.
``
We
have
proved
*NL*
that
it
was
impossible
to
keep
our
resolutions
.
We
have
proved
that
*NL*
the
feeling
which
draws
us
toward
each
other
is
too
strong
to
be
*NL*
overcome
.
That
natural
law
surmounts
every
other
;
we
ca
n't
help
what
*NL*
it
clashes
with
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
not
so
,
Stephen
;
I
'm
quite
sure
that
is
wrong
.
I
have
tried
to
*NL*
think
it
again
and
again
;
but
I
see
,
if
we
judged
in
that
way
,
there
*NL*
would
be
a
warrant
for
all
treachery
and
cruelty
;
we
should
justify
*NL*
breaking
the
most
sacred
ties
that
can
ever
be
formed
on
earth
.
If
the
*NL*
past
is
not
to
bind
us
,
where
can
duty
lie
?
We
should
have
no
law
but
*NL*
the
inclination
of
the
moment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
there
are
ties
that
ca
n't
be
kept
by
mere
resolution
,
''
said
*NL*
Stephen
,
starting
up
and
walking
about
again
.
``
What
is
outward
*NL*
faithfulness
?
Would
they
have
thanked
us
for
anything
so
hollow
as
*NL*
constancy
without
love
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
did
not
answer
immediately
.
She
was
undergoing
an
inward
as
*NL*
well
as
an
outward
contest
.
At
last
she
said
,
with
a
passionate
*NL*
assertion
of
her
conviction
,
as
much
against
herself
as
against
him
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
seems
right
--
at
first
;
but
when
I
look
further
,
I
'm
sure
it
is
*NL*
_
not
_
right
.
Faithfulness
and
constancy
mean
something
else
besides
*NL*
doing
what
is
easiest
and
pleasantest
to
ourselves
.
They
mean
*NL*
renouncing
whatever
is
opposed
to
the
reliance
others
have
in
*NL*
us
,
--
whatever
would
cause
misery
to
those
whom
the
course
of
our
lives
*NL*
has
made
dependent
on
us
.
If
we
--
if
I
had
been
better
,
nobler
,
those
*NL*
claims
would
have
been
so
strongly
present
with
me
,
--
I
should
have
*NL*
felt
them
pressing
on
my
heart
so
continually
,
just
as
they
do
now
in
*NL*
the
moments
when
my
conscience
is
awake
,
--
that
the
opposite
feeling
*NL*
would
never
have
grown
in
me
,
as
it
has
done
;
it
would
have
been
*NL*
quenched
at
once
,
I
should
have
prayed
for
help
so
earnestly
,
I
should
*NL*
have
rushed
away
as
we
rush
from
hideous
danger
.
I
feel
no
excuse
for
*NL*
myself
,
none
.
I
should
never
have
failed
toward
Lucy
and
Philip
as
I
*NL*
have
done
,
if
I
had
not
been
weak
,
selfish
,
and
hard
,
--
able
to
think
*NL*
of
their
pain
without
a
pain
to
myself
that
would
have
destroyed
all
*NL*
temptation
.
Oh
,
what
is
Lucy
feeling
now
?
She
believed
in
me
--
she
*NL*
loved
me
--
she
was
so
good
to
me
.
Think
of
her
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
's
voice
was
getting
choked
as
she
uttered
these
last
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
_
ca
n't
_
think
of
her
,
''
said
Stephen
,
stamping
as
if
with
pain
.
``
I
*NL*
can
think
of
nothing
but
you
,
Maggie
.
You
demand
of
a
man
what
is
*NL*
impossible
.
I
felt
that
once
;
but
I
ca
n't
go
back
to
it
now
.
And
where
*NL*
is
the
use
of
_
your
_
thinking
of
it
,
except
to
torture
me
?
You
ca
n't
*NL*
save
them
from
pain
now
;
you
can
only
tear
yourself
from
me
,
and
make
*NL*
my
life
worthless
to
me
.
And
even
if
we
could
go
back
,
and
both
fulfil
*NL*
our
engagements
,
--
if
that
were
possible
now
,
--
it
would
be
hateful
,
*NL*
horrible
,
to
think
of
your
ever
being
Philip
's
wife
,
--
of
your
ever
*NL*
being
the
wife
of
a
man
you
did
n't
love
.
We
have
both
been
rescued
*NL*
from
a
mistake
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
deep
flush
came
over
Maggie
's
face
,
and
she
could
n't
speak
.
Stephen
*NL*
saw
this
.
He
sat
down
again
,
taking
her
hand
in
his
,
and
looking
at
*NL*
her
with
passionate
entreaty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Maggie
!
Dearest
!
If
you
love
me
,
you
are
mine
.
Who
can
have
so
great
*NL*
a
claim
on
you
as
I
have
?
My
life
is
bound
up
in
your
love
.
There
is
*NL*
nothing
in
the
past
that
can
annul
our
right
to
each
other
;
it
is
the
*NL*
first
time
we
have
either
of
us
loved
with
our
whole
heart
and
soul
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
was
still
silent
for
a
little
while
,
looking
down
.
Stephen
was
*NL*
in
a
flutter
of
new
hope
;
he
was
going
to
triumph
.
But
she
raised
her
*NL*
eyes
and
met
his
with
a
glance
that
was
filled
with
the
anguish
of
*NL*
regret
,
not
with
yielding
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
not
with
my
whole
heart
and
soul
,
Stephen
,
''
she
said
with
timid
*NL*
resolution

``
I
have
never
consented
to
it
with
my
whole
mind
.
There
*NL*
are
memories
,
and
affections
,
and
longings
after
perfect
goodness
,
*NL*
that
have
such
a
strong
hold
on
me
;
they
would
never
quit
me
for
long
;
*NL*
they
would
come
back
and
be
pain
to
me
--
repentance
.
I
could
n't
live
in
*NL*
peace
if
I
put
the
shadow
of
a
wilful
sin
between
myself
and
God
.
I
*NL*
have
caused
sorrow
already
--
I
know
--
I
feel
it
;
but
I
have
never
*NL*
deliberately
consented
to
it
;
I
have
never
said
,
`
They
shall
suffer
,
*NL*
that
I
may
have
joy
.
'
It
has
never
been
my
will
to
marry
you
;
if
you
*NL*
were
to
win
consent
from
the
momentary
triumph
of
my
feeling
for
you
,
*NL*
you
would
not
have
my
whole
soul
.
If
I
could
wake
back
again
into
the
*NL*
time
before
yesterday
,
I
would
choose
to
be
true
to
my
calmer
*NL*
affections
,
and
live
without
the
joy
of
love
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
loosed
her
hand
,
and
rising
impatiently
,
walked
up
and
down
*NL*
the
room
in
suppressed
rage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
God
!
''
he
burst
out
at
last
,
``
what
a
miserable
thing
a
woman
's
*NL*
love
is
to
a
man
's
!
I
could
commit
crimes
for
you
,
--
and
you
can
*NL*
balance
and
choose
in
that
way
.
But
you
_
do
n't
_
love
me
;
if
you
had
a
*NL*
tithe
of
the
feeling
for
me
that
I
have
for
you
,
it
would
be
*NL*
impossible
to
you
to
think
for
a
moment
of
sacrificing
me
.
But
it
*NL*
weighs
nothing
with
you
that
you
are
robbing
me
of
_
my
_
life
's
*NL*
happiness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
pressed
her
fingers
together
almost
convulsively
as
she
held
*NL*
them
clasped
on
her
lap
.
A
great
terror
was
upon
her
,
as
if
she
were
*NL*
ever
and
anon
seeing
where
she
stood
by
great
flashes
of
lightning
,
*NL*
and
then
again
stretched
forth
her
hands
in
the
darkness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
do
n't
sacrifice
you
--
I
could
n't
sacrifice
you
,
''
she
said
,
as
*NL*
soon
as
she
could
speak
again
;
``
but
I
ca
n't
believe
in
a
good
for
you
,
*NL*
that
I
feel
,
that
we
both
feel
,
is
a
wrong
toward
others
.
We
ca
n't
*NL*
choose
happiness
either
for
ourselves
or
for
another
;
we
ca
n't
tell
*NL*
where
that
will
lie
.
We
can
only
choose
whether
we
will
indulge
*NL*
ourselves
in
the
present
moment
,
or
whether
we
will
renounce
that
,
for
*NL*
the
sake
of
obeying
the
divine
voice
within
us
,
--
for
the
sake
of
being
*NL*
true
to
all
the
motives
that
sanctify
our
lives
.
I
know
this
belief
is
*NL*
hard
;
it
has
slipped
away
from
me
again
and
again
;
but
I
have
felt
*NL*
that
if
I
let
it
go
forever
,
I
should
have
no
light
through
the
*NL*
darkness
of
this
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
Maggie
,
''
said
Stephen
,
seating
himself
by
her
again
,
``
is
it
*NL*
possible
you
do
n't
see
that
what
happened
yesterday
has
altered
the
*NL*
whole
position
of
things
?
What
infatuation
is
it
,
what
obstinate
*NL*
prepossession
,
that
blinds
you
to
that
?
It
is
too
late
to
say
what
we
*NL*
might
have
done
or
what
we
ought
to
have
done
.
Admitting
the
very
*NL*
worst
view
of
what
has
been
done
,
it
is
a
fact
we
must
act
on
now
;
our
*NL*
position
is
altered
;
the
right
course
is
no
longer
what
it
was
before
.
*NL*
We
must
accept
our
own
actions
and
start
afresh
from
them
.
Suppose
we
*NL*
had
been
married
yesterday
?
It
is
nearly
the
same
thing
.
The
effect
on
*NL*
others
would
not
have
been
different
.
It
would
only
have
made
this
*NL*
difference
to
ourselves
,
''
Stephen
added
bitterly
,
``
that
you
might
have
*NL*
acknowledged
then
that
your
tie
to
me
was
stronger
than
to
others
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
a
deep
flush
came
over
Maggie
's
face
,
and
she
was
silent
.
*NL*
Stephen
thought
again
that
he
was
beginning
to
prevail
,
--
he
had
never
*NL*
yet
believed
that
he
should
_
not
_
prevail
;
there
are
possibilities
*NL*
which
our
minds
shrink
from
too
completely
for
us
to
fear
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dearest
,
''
he
said
,
in
his
deepest
,
tenderest
tone
,
leaning
toward
*NL*
her
,
and
putting
his
arm
round
her
,
``
you
_
are
_
mine
now
,
--
the
world
*NL*
believes
it
;
duty
must
spring
out
of
that
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
a
few
hours
you
will
be
legally
mine
,
and
those
who
had
claims
on
*NL*
us
will
submit
,
--
they
will
see
that
there
was
a
force
which
declared
*NL*
against
their
claims
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
's
eyes
opened
wide
in
one
terrified
look
at
the
face
that
was
*NL*
close
to
hers
,
and
she
started
up
,
pale
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
ca
n't
do
it
,
''
she
said
,
in
a
voice
almost
of
agony
;
``
Stephen
,
*NL*
do
n't
ask
me
--
do
n't
urge
me
.
I
ca
n't
argue
any
longer
,
--
I
do
n't
know
*NL*
what
is
wise
;
but
my
heart
will
not
let
me
do
it
.
I
see
,
--
I
feel
their
*NL*
trouble
now
;
it
is
as
if
it
were
branded
on
my
mind
.
_
I
_
have
*NL*
suffered
,
and
had
no
one
to
pity
me
;
and
now
I
have
made
others
*NL*
suffer
.
It
would
never
leave
me
;
it
would
embitter
your
love
to
me
.
I
*NL*
_
do
_
care
for
Philip
--
in
a
different
way
;
I
remember
all
we
said
to
*NL*
each
other
;
I
know
how
he
thought
of
me
as
the
one
promise
of
his
*NL*
life
.
He
was
given
to
me
that
I
might
make
his
lot
less
hard
;
and
I
*NL*
have
forsaken
him
.
And
Lucy
--
she
has
been
deceived
;
she
who
trusted
me
*NL*
more
than
any
one
.
I
can
not
marry
you
;
I
can
not
take
a
good
for
myself
*NL*
that
has
been
wrung
out
of
their
misery
.
It
is
not
the
force
that
*NL*
ought
to
rule
us
,
--
this
that
we
feel
for
each
other
;
it
would
rend
me
*NL*
away
from
all
that
my
past
life
has
made
dear
and
holy
to
me
.
I
ca
n't
*NL*
set
out
on
a
fresh
life
,
and
forget
that
;
I
must
go
back
to
it
,
and
*NL*
cling
to
it
,
else
I
shall
feel
as
if
there
were
nothing
firm
beneath
*NL*
my
feet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
God
,
Maggie
!
''
said
Stephen
,
rising
too
and
grasping
her
arm
,
*NL*
``
you
rave
.
How
can
you
go
back
without
marrying
me
?
You
do
n't
know
*NL*
what
will
be
said
,
dearest
.
You
see
nothing
as
it
really
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
do
.
But
they
will
believe
me

I
will
confess
everything

Lucy
*NL*
will
believe

--
she
will
forgive
you
,
and
--
and
--
oh
,
_
some
_
good
will
*NL*
come
by
clinging
to
the
right
.
Dear
,
dear
Stephen
,
let
me
go
!
--
do
n't
*NL*
drag
me
into
deeper
remorse
.
My
whole
soul
has
never
consented
;
it
*NL*
does
not
consent
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
let
go
her
arm
,
and
sank
back
on
his
chair
,
half-stunned
by
*NL*
despairing
rage
.
He
was
silent
a
few
moments
,
not
looking
at
her
;
*NL*
while
her
eyes
were
turned
toward
him
yearningly
,
in
alarm
at
this
*NL*
sudden
change
.
At
last
he
said
,
still
without
looking
at
her
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
,
then
,
--
leave
me
;
do
n't
torture
me
any
longer
,
--
I
ca
n't
bear
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Involuntarily
she
leaned
toward
him
and
put
out
her
hand
to
touch
his
.
*NL*
But
he
shrank
from
it
as
if
it
had
been
burning
iron
,
and
said
*NL*
again
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Leave
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
was
not
conscious
of
a
decision
as
she
turned
away
from
that
*NL*
gloomy
averted
face
,
and
walked
out
of
the
room
;
it
was
like
an
*NL*
automatic
action
that
fulfils
a
forgotten
intention
.
What
came
after
?
*NL*
A
sense
of
stairs
descended
as
if
in
a
dream
,
of
flagstones
,
of
a
*NL*
chaise
and
horses
standing
,
then
a
street
,
and
a
turning
into
another
*NL*
street
where
a
stage-coach
was
standing
,
taking
in
passengers
,
and
the
*NL*
darting
thought
that
that
coach
would
take
her
away
,
perhaps
toward
*NL*
home
.
But
she
could
ask
nothing
yet
;
she
only
got
into
the
coach
.
*NL*
*NL*
Home
--
where
her
mother
and
brother
were
,
Philip
,
Lucy
,
the
scene
of
*NL*
her
very
cares
and
trials
--
was
the
haven
toward
which
her
mind
tended
;
*NL*
the
sanctuary
where
sacred
relics
lay
,
where
she
would
be
rescued
from
*NL*
more
falling
.
The
thought
of
Stephen
was
like
a
horrible
throbbing
*NL*
pain
,
which
yet
,
as
such
pains
do
,
seemed
to
urge
all
other
thoughts
*NL*
into
activity
.
But
among
her
thoughts
,
what
others
would
say
and
think
*NL*
of
her
conduct
was
hardly
present
.
Love
and
deep
pity
and
remorseful
*NL*
anguish
left
no
room
for
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
coach
was
taking
her
to
York
,
farther
away
from
home
;
but
she
did
*NL*
not
learn
that
until
she
was
set
down
in
the
old
city
at
midnight
.
It
*NL*
was
no
matter
;
she
could
sleep
there
,
and
start
home
the
next
day
.
She
*NL*
had
her
purse
in
her
pocket
,
with
all
her
money
in
it
,
--
a
bank-note
*NL*
and
a
sovereign
;
she
had
kept
it
in
her
pocket
from
forgetfulness
,
*NL*
after
going
out
to
make
purchases
the
day
before
yesterday
.
*NL*
*NL*
Did
she
lie
down
in
the
gloomy
bedroom
of
the
old
inn
that
night
with
*NL*
her
will
bent
unwaveringly
on
the
path
of
penitent
sacrifice
?
The
*NL*
great
struggles
of
life
are
not
so
easy
as
that
;
the
great
problems
of
*NL*
life
are
not
so
clear
.
In
the
darkness
of
that
night
she
saw
Stephen
's
*NL*
face
turned
toward
her
in
passionate
,
reproachful
misery
;
she
lived
*NL*
through
again
all
the
tremulous
delights
of
his
presence
with
her
that
*NL*
made
existence
an
easy
floating
in
a
stream
of
joy
,
instead
of
a
quiet
*NL*
resolved
endurance
and
effort
.
The
love
she
had
renounced
came
back
*NL*
upon
her
with
a
cruel
charm
;
she
felt
herself
opening
her
arms
to
*NL*
receive
it
once
more
;
and
then
it
seemed
to
slip
away
and
fade
and
*NL*
vanish
,
leaving
only
the
dying
sound
of
a
deep
,
thrilling
voice
that
*NL*
said
,
``
Gone
,
forever
gone
.

*NL*
The
Return
to
the
Mill
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Between
four
and
five
o'clock
on
the
afternoon
of
the
fifth
day
from
*NL*
that
on
which
Stephen
and
Maggie
had
left
St.
Ogg
's
,
Tom
Tulliver
was
*NL*
standing
on
the
gravel
walk
outside
the
old
house
at
Dorlcote
Mill
.
He
*NL*
was
master
there
now
;
he
had
half
fulfilled
his
father
's
dying
wish
,
*NL*
and
by
years
of
steady
self-government
and
energetic
work
he
had
*NL*
brought
himself
near
to
the
attainment
of
more
than
the
old
*NL*
respectability
which
had
been
the
proud
inheritance
of
the
Dodsons
and
*NL*
Tullivers
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Tom
's
face
,
as
he
stood
in
the
hot
,
still
sunshine
of
that
summer
*NL*
afternoon
,
had
no
gladness
,
no
triumph
in
it
.
His
mouth
wore
its
*NL*
bitterest
expression
,
his
severe
brow
its
hardest
and
deepest
fold
,
as
*NL*
he
drew
down
his
hat
farther
over
his
eyes
to
shelter
them
from
the
*NL*
sun
,
and
thrusting
his
hands
deep
into
his
pockets
,
began
to
walk
up
*NL*
and
down
the
gravel
.
No
news
of
his
sister
had
been
heard
since
Bob
*NL*
Jakin
had
come
back
in
the
steamer
from
Mudport
,
and
put
an
end
to
all
*NL*
improbable
suppositions
of
an
accident
on
the
water
by
stating
that
he
*NL*
had
seen
her
land
from
a
vessel
with
Mr.
Stephen
Guest
.
Would
the
next
*NL*
news
be
that
she
was
married
,
--
or
what
?
Probably
that
she
was
not
*NL*
married
;
Tom
's
mind
was
set
to
the
expectation
of
the
worst
that
could
*NL*
happen
,
--
not
death
,
but
disgrace
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
was
walking
with
his
back
toward
the
entrance
gate
,
and
his
face
*NL*
toward
the
rushing
mill-stream
,
a
tall
,
dark-eyed
figure
,
that
we
know
*NL*
well
,
approached
the
gate
,
and
paused
to
look
at
him
with
a
*NL*
fast-beating
heart
.
Her
brother
was
the
human
being
of
whom
she
had
*NL*
been
most
afraid
from
her
childhood
upward
;
afraid
with
that
fear
*NL*
which
springs
in
us
when
we
love
one
who
is
inexorable
,
unbending
,
*NL*
unmodifiable
,
with
a
mind
that
we
can
never
mould
ourselves
upon
,
and
*NL*
yet
that
we
can
not
endure
to
alienate
from
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
deep-rooted
fear
was
shaking
Maggie
now
;
but
her
mind
was
*NL*
unswervingly
bent
on
returning
to
her
brother
,
as
the
natural
refuge
*NL*
that
had
been
given
her
.
In
her
deep
humiliation
under
the
retrospect
*NL*
of
her
own
weakness
,
--
in
her
anguish
at
the
injury
she
had
*NL*
inflicted
,
--
she
almost
desired
to
endure
the
severity
of
Tom
's
*NL*
reproof
,
to
submit
in
patient
silence
to
that
harsh
,
disapproving
*NL*
judgment
against
which
she
had
so
often
rebelled
;
it
seemed
no
more
*NL*
than
just
to
her
now
,
--
who
was
weaker
than
she
was
?
She
craved
that
*NL*
outward
help
to
her
better
purpose
which
would
come
from
complete
,
*NL*
submissive
confession
;
from
being
in
the
presence
of
those
whose
looks
*NL*
and
words
would
be
a
reflection
of
her
own
conscience
.
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
had
been
kept
on
her
bed
at
York
for
a
day
with
that
*NL*
prostrating
headache
which
was
likely
to
follow
on
the
terrible
strain
*NL*
of
the
previous
day
and
night
.
There
was
an
expression
of
physical
*NL*
pain
still
about
her
brow
and
eyes
,
and
her
whole
appearance
,
with
her
*NL*
dress
so
long
unchanged
,
was
worn
and
distressed
.
She
lifted
the
latch
*NL*
of
the
gate
and
walked
in
slowly
.
Tom
did
not
hear
the
gate
;
he
was
*NL*
just
then
close
upon
the
roaring
dam
;
but
he
presently
turned
,
and
*NL*
lifting
up
his
eyes
,
saw
the
figure
whose
worn
look
and
loneliness
*NL*
seemed
to
him
a
confirmation
of
his
worst
conjectures
.
He
paused
,
*NL*
trembling
and
white
with
disgust
and
indignation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
paused
too
,
three
yards
before
him
.
She
felt
the
hatred
in
his
*NL*
face
,
felt
it
rushing
through
her
fibres
;
but
she
must
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tom
,
''
she
began
faintly
,
``
I
am
come
back
to
you
,
--
I
am
come
back
*NL*
home
--
for
refuge
--
to
tell
you
everything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
find
no
home
with
me
,
''
he
answered
,
with
tremulous
rage
.
*NL*
``
You
have
disgraced
us
all
.
You
have
disgraced
my
father
's
name
.
You
*NL*
have
been
a
curse
to
your
best
friends
.
You
have
been
base
,
deceitful
;
*NL*
no
motives
are
strong
enough
to
restrain
you
.
I
wash
my
hands
of
you
*NL*
forever
.
You
do
n't
belong
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Their
mother
had
come
to
the
door
now
.
She
stood
paralyzed
by
the
*NL*
double
shock
of
seeing
Maggie
and
hearing
Tom
's
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tom
,
''
said
Maggie
,
with
more
courage
,
``
I
am
perhaps
not
so
guilty
as
*NL*
you
believe
me
to
be
.
I
never
meant
to
give
way
to
my
feelings
.
I
*NL*
struggled
against
them
.
I
was
carried
too
far
in
the
boat
to
come
back
*NL*
on
Tuesday
.
I
came
back
as
soon
as
I
could
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
believe
in
you
any
more
,
''
said
Tom
,
gradually
passing
from
*NL*
the
tremulous
excitement
of
the
first
moment
to
cold
inflexibility
.
*NL*
``
You
have
been
carrying
on
a
clandestine
relation
with
Stephen
*NL*
Guest
,
--
as
you
did
before
with
another
.
He
went
to
see
you
at
my
aunt
*NL*
Moss
's
;
you
walked
alone
with
him
in
the
lanes
;
you
must
have
behaved
*NL*
as
no
modest
girl
would
have
done
to
her
cousin
's
lover
,
else
that
*NL*
could
never
have
happened
.
The
people
at
Luckreth
saw
you
pass
;
you
*NL*
passed
all
the
other
places
;
you
knew
what
you
were
doing
.
You
have
*NL*
been
using
Philip
Wakem
as
a
screen
to
deceive
Lucy
,
--
the
kindest
*NL*
friend
you
ever
had
.
Go
and
see
the
return
you
have
made
her
.
She
's
*NL*
ill
;
unable
to
speak
.
My
mother
ca
n't
go
near
her
,
lest
she
should
*NL*
remind
her
of
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
was
half
stunned
,
--
too
heavily
pressed
upon
by
her
anguish
even
*NL*
to
discern
any
difference
between
her
actual
guilt
and
her
brother
's
*NL*
accusations
,
still
less
to
vindicate
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tom
,
''
she
said
,
crushing
her
hands
together
under
her
cloak
,
in
the
*NL*
effort
to
speak
again
,
``
whatever
I
have
done
,
I
repent
it
bitterly
.
I
*NL*
want
to
make
amends
.
I
will
endure
anything
.
I
want
to
be
kept
from
*NL*
doing
wrong
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
_
will
_
keep
you
?
''
said
Tom
,
with
cruel
bitterness
.
``
Not
*NL*
religion
;
not
your
natural
feelings
of
gratitude
and
honor
.
And
he
--
he
*NL*
would
deserve
to
be
shot
,
if
it
were
not
--
But
you
are
ten
times
*NL*
worse
than
he
is
.
I
loathe
your
character
and
your
conduct
.
You
*NL*
struggled
with
your
feelings
,
you
say
.
Yes
!
_
I
_
have
had
feelings
to
*NL*
struggle
with
;
but
I
conquered
them
.
I
have
had
a
harder
life
than
you
*NL*
have
had
;
but
I
have
found
_
my
_
comfort
in
doing
my
duty
.
But
I
will
*NL*
sanction
no
such
character
as
yours
;
the
world
shall
know
that
_
I
_
*NL*
feel
the
difference
between
right
and
wrong
.
If
you
are
in
want
,
I
*NL*
will
provide
for
you
;
let
my
mother
know
.
But
you
shall
not
come
under
*NL*
my
roof
.
It
is
enough
that
I
have
to
bear
the
thought
of
your
*NL*
disgrace
;
the
sight
of
you
is
hateful
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Slowly
Maggie
was
turning
away
with
despair
in
her
heart
.
But
the
poor
*NL*
frightened
mother
's
love
leaped
out
now
,
stronger
than
all
dread
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
child
!
I
'll
go
with
you
.
You
've
got
a
mother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Oh
,
the
sweet
rest
of
that
embrace
to
the
heart-stricken
Maggie
!
More
*NL*
helpful
than
all
wisdom
is
one
draught
of
simple
human
pity
that
will
*NL*
not
forsake
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
turned
and
walked
into
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
in
,
my
child
,
''
Mrs.
Tulliver
whispered
.
``
He
'll
let
you
stay
and
*NL*
sleep
in
my
bed
.
He
wo
n't
deny
that
if
I
ask
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
mother
,
''
said
Maggie
,
in
a
low
tone
,
like
a
moan
.
``
I
will
never
*NL*
go
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
wait
for
me
outside
.
I
'll
get
ready
and
come
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
his
mother
appeared
with
her
bonnet
on
,
Tom
came
out
to
her
in
*NL*
the
passage
,
and
put
money
into
her
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
house
is
yours
,
mother
,
always
,
''
he
said
.
``
You
will
come
and
let
*NL*
me
know
everything
you
want
;
you
will
come
back
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Mrs.
Tulliver
took
the
money
,
too
frightened
to
say
anything
.
The
*NL*
only
thing
clear
to
her
was
the
mother
's
instinct
that
she
would
go
*NL*
with
her
unhappy
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
was
waiting
outside
the
gate
;
she
took
her
mother
's
hand
and
*NL*
they
walked
a
little
way
in
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mother
,
''
said
Maggie
,
at
last
,
``
we
will
go
to
Luke
's
cottage
.
Luke
*NL*
will
take
me
in
.
He
was
very
good
to
me
when
I
was
a
little
girl
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
got
no
room
for
us
,
my
dear
,
now
;
his
wife
's
got
so
many
*NL*
children
.
I
do
n't
know
where
to
go
,
if
it
is
n't
to
one
o
'
your
aunts
;
*NL*
and
I
hardly
durst
,
''
said
poor
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
quite
destitute
of
*NL*
mental
resources
in
this
extremity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
was
silent
a
little
while
,
and
then
said
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
go
to
Bob
Jakin
's
,
mother
;
his
wife
will
have
room
for
us
,
if
*NL*
they
have
no
other
lodger
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
they
went
on
their
way
to
St.
Ogg
's
,
to
the
old
house
by
the
*NL*
river-side
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bob
himself
was
at
home
,
with
a
heaviness
at
heart
which
resisted
even
*NL*
the
new
joy
and
pride
of
possessing
a
two-months
'
-
old
baby
,
quite
the
*NL*
liveliest
of
its
age
that
had
ever
been
born
to
prince
or
packman
.
He
*NL*
would
perhaps
not
so
thoroughly
have
understood
all
the
dubiousness
of
*NL*
Maggie
's
appearance
with
Mr.
Stephen
Guest
on
the
quay
at
Mudport
if
*NL*
he
had
not
witnessed
the
effect
it
produced
on
Tom
when
he
went
to
*NL*
report
it
;
and
since
then
,
the
circumstances
which
in
any
case
gave
a
*NL*
disastrous
character
to
her
elopement
had
passed
beyond
the
more
*NL*
polite
circles
of
St.
Ogg
's
,
and
had
become
matter
of
common
talk
,
*NL*
accessible
to
the
grooms
and
errand-boys
.
So
that
when
he
opened
the
*NL*
door
and
saw
Maggie
standing
before
him
in
her
sorrow
and
weariness
,
*NL*
he
had
no
questions
to
ask
except
one
which
he
dared
only
ask
*NL*
himself
,
--
where
was
Mr.
Stephen
Guest
?
Bob
,
for
his
part
,
hoped
he
*NL*
might
be
in
the
warmest
department
of
an
asylum
understood
to
exist
in
*NL*
the
other
world
for
gentlemen
who
are
likely
to
be
in
fallen
*NL*
circumstances
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
lodgings
were
vacant
,
and
both
Mrs.
Jakin
the
larger
and
Mrs.
*NL*
Jakin
the
less
were
commanded
to
make
all
things
comfortable
for
``
the
*NL*
old
Missis
and
the
young
Miss
''
;
alas
that
she
was
still
``
Miss
!
''
The
*NL*
ingenious
Bob
was
sorely
perplexed
as
to
how
this
result
could
have
*NL*
come
about
;
how
Mr.
Stephen
Guest
could
have
gone
away
from
her
,
or
*NL*
could
have
let
her
go
away
from
him
,
when
he
had
the
chance
of
keeping
*NL*
her
with
him
.
But
he
was
silent
,
and
would
not
allow
his
wife
to
ask
*NL*
him
a
question
;
would
not
present
himself
in
the
room
,
lest
it
should
*NL*
appear
like
intrusion
and
a
wish
to
pry
;
having
the
same
chivalry
*NL*
toward
dark-eyed
Maggie
as
in
the
days
when
he
had
bought
her
the
*NL*
memorable
present
of
books
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
after
a
day
or
two
Mrs.
Tulliver
was
gone
to
the
Mill
again
for
a
*NL*
few
hours
to
see
to
Tom
's
household
matters
.
Maggie
had
wished
this
;
*NL*
after
the
first
violent
outburst
of
feeling
which
came
as
soon
as
she
*NL*
had
no
longer
any
active
purpose
to
fulfil
,
she
was
less
in
need
of
*NL*
her
mother
's
presence
;
she
even
desired
to
be
alone
with
her
grief
.
*NL*
But
she
had
been
solitary
only
a
little
while
in
the
old
sitting-room
*NL*
that
looked
on
the
river
,
when
there
came
a
tap
at
the
door
,
and
*NL*
turning
round
her
sad
face
as
she
said
``
Come
in
,
''
she
saw
Bob
enter
,
*NL*
with
the
baby
in
his
arms
and
Mumps
at
his
heels
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
'll
go
back
,
if
it
disturbs
you
,
Miss
,
''
said
Bob
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Maggie
,
in
a
low
voice
,
wishing
she
could
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bob
,
closing
the
door
behind
him
,
came
and
stood
before
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
we
've
got
a
little
un
,
Miss
,
and
I
want
'd
you
to
look
at
it
,
*NL*
and
take
it
in
your
arms
,
if
you
'd
be
so
good
.
For
we
made
free
to
*NL*
name
it
after
you
,
and
it
`
ud
be
better
for
your
takin
'
a
bit
o
'
*NL*
notice
on
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
could
not
speak
,
but
she
put
out
her
arms
to
receive
the
tiny
*NL*
baby
,
while
Mumps
snuffed
at
it
anxiously
,
to
ascertain
that
this
*NL*
transference
was
all
right
.
Maggie
's
heart
had
swelled
at
this
action
*NL*
and
speech
of
Bob
's
;
she
knew
well
enough
that
it
was
a
way
he
had
*NL*
chosen
to
show
his
sympathy
and
respect
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sit
down
,
Bob
,
''
she
said
presently
,
and
he
sat
down
in
silence
,
*NL*
finding
his
tongue
unmanageable
in
quite
a
new
fashion
,
refusing
to
*NL*
say
what
he
wanted
it
to
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bob
,
''
she
said
,
after
a
few
moments
,
looking
down
at
the
baby
,
and
*NL*
holding
it
anxiously
,
as
if
she
feared
it
might
slip
from
her
mind
and
*NL*
her
fingers
,
``
I
have
a
favor
to
ask
of
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
speak
so
,
Miss
,
''
said
Bob
,
grasping
the
skin
of
Mumps
's
*NL*
neck
;
``
if
there
's
anything
I
can
do
for
you
,
I
should
look
upon
it
as
*NL*
a
day

earnings
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
you
to
go
to
Dr.
Kenn

,
and
ask
to
speak
to
him
,
and
tell
him
*NL*
that
I
am
here
,
and
should
be
very
grateful
if
he
would
come
to
me
*NL*
while
my
mother
is
away

She
will
not
come
back
till
evening

*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh

lies
dead

said
Maggie

she
added
,
with
a
new
sense

of
despondency
at
this
idea

*NL*
Bob
's
tongue
was
now
evidently
loosed
from
its
unwonted
bondage
,
and
*NL*
might
even
be
in
danger
of
doing
more
work
than
was
required
of
it
.
*NL*
But
the
subjects
on
which
he
longed
to
be
informed
were
so
steep
and
*NL*
difficult
of
approach
,
that
his
tongue
was
likely
to
run
on
along
the
*NL*
level
rather
than
to
carry
him
on
that
unbeaten
road
.
He
felt
this
,
*NL*
and
was
silent
again
for
a
little
while
,
ruminating
much
on
the
*NL*
possible
forms
in
which
he
might
put
a
question
.
At
last
he
said
,
in
a
*NL*
more
timid
voice
than
usual
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
give
me
leave
to
ask
you
only
one
thing
,
Miss
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
was
rather
startled
,
but
she
answered
,
``
Yes
,
Bob
,
if
it
is
*NL*
about
myself
--
not
about
any
one
else
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Miss
,
it
's
this
.
_
Do
_
you
owe
anybody
a
grudge
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
not
any
one
,
''
said
Maggie
,
looking
up
at
him
inquiringly
.
``
Why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
lors
,
Miss
,
''
said
Bob
,
pinching
Mumps
's
neck
harder
than
ever
.
``
I
*NL*
wish
you
did
,
an
'
tell
me
;
I

*NL*
``

said
Maggie
,
smiling
faintly
,
``
you
're
a
very
good

But
I

*NL*
wrong

I
've
done
wrong
myself
too
often

''
*NL*
*NL*
This
view
of
things
was
puzzling
to
Bob
,
and
threw
more
obscurity
than
*NL*
ever
over
what
could
possibly
have
happened
between
Stephen
and
*NL*
Maggie
.
But
further
questions
would
have
been
too
intrusive
,
even
if
*NL*
he
could
have
framed
them
suitably
,
and
he
was
obliged
to
carry
baby
*NL*
away
again
to
an
expectant
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Happen
you
'd
like
Mumps
for
company

''
he
said
when
he
had
taken
*NL*
the
baby
again
.
``
He
's
rare
company

Mumps

;
he
knows
iverything

*NL*
makes

If

tell
him
,
he
'll
lie
before

as
still

just

my

*NL*
leave

a

Lors

it
's
a
fine

*NL*
a

it

stick

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
do
leave
him
,

,
''
said
Maggie
.
``
I
think
I
should

have
Mumps

''
*NL*
*NL*
``

down

said
Bob
,
pointing
to
a
place
in
front
of
*NL*
Maggie
,
``

niver

*NL*
Mumps
lay
down
at

Chapter
II
*NL*
*NL*
St.
Ogg
's
Passes
Judgment
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
soon
known
throughout
St.
Ogg
's
that
Miss
Tulliver
was
come
*NL*
back
;
she
had
not
,
then
,
eloped
in
order
to
be
married
to
Mr.
Stephen
*NL*
Guest
,
--
at
all
events
,
Mr.
Stephen
Guest
had
not
married
her
;
which
*NL*
came
to
the
same
thing
,
so
far
as
her
culpability
was
concerned
.
We
*NL*
judge
others
according
to
results
;
how
else
?
--
not
knowing
the
process
*NL*
by
which
results
are
arrived
at
.
If
Miss
Tulliver
,
after
a
few
months
*NL*
of
well-chosen
travel
,
had
returned
as
Mrs.
Stephen
Guest
,
with
a
*NL*
post-marital
_
trousseau
_
,
and
all
the
advantages
possessed
even
by
the
*NL*
most
unwelcome
wife
of
an
only
son
,
public
opinion
,
which
at
St.
*NL*
Ogg
's
,
as
else
where
,
always
knew
what
to
think
,
would
have
judged
in
*NL*
strict
consistency
with
those
results
.
Public
opinion
,
in
these
cases
,
*NL*
is
always
of
the
feminine
gender
,
--
not
the
world
,
but
the
world
's
*NL*
wife
;
and
she
would
have
seen
that
two
handsome
young
people
--
the
*NL*
gentleman
of
quite
the
first
family
in
St.
Ogg
's
--
having
found
*NL*
themselves
in
a
false
position
,
had
been
led
into
a
course
which
,
to
*NL*
say
the
least
of
it
,
was
highly
injudicious
,
and
productive
of
sad
*NL*
pain
and
disappointment
,
especially
to
that
sweet
young
thing
,
Miss
*NL*
Deane
.
Mr.
Stephen
Guest
had
certainly
not
behaved
well
;
but
then
,
*NL*
young
men
were
liable
to
those
sudden
infatuated
attachments
;
and
bad
*NL*
as
it
might
seem
in
Mrs.
Stephen
Guest
to
admit
the
faintest
advances
*NL*
from
her
cousin
's
lover
-LRB-
indeed
it
_
had
_
been
said
that
she
was
*NL*
actually
engaged
to
young
Wakem
,
--
old
Wakem
himself
had
mentioned
it
-RRB-
,
*NL*
still
,
she
was
very
young
,
--
``
and
a
deformed
young
man
,
you
know
!
--
and
*NL*
young
Guest
so
very
fascinating
;
and
,
they
say
,
he
positively
worships
*NL*
her
-LRB-
to
be
sure
,
that
ca
n't
last
!
-RRB-
,
and
he
ran
away
with
her
in
the
*NL*
boat
quite
against
her
will
,
and
what
could
she
do
?
She
could
n't
come
*NL*
back
then
;
no
one
would
have
spoken
to
her
;
and
how
very
well
that
*NL*
maize-colored
satinette
becomes
her
complexion
!
It
seems
as
if
the
*NL*
folds
in
front
were
quite
come
in
;
several
of
her
dresses
are
made
*NL*
so
,
--
they
say
he
thinks
nothing
too
handsome
to
buy
for
her
.
Poor
Miss
*NL*
Deane
!
She
is
very
pitiable
;
but
then
there
was
no
positive
*NL*
engagement
;
and
the
air
at
the
coast
will
do
her
good
.
After
all
,
if
*NL*
young
Guest
felt
no
more
for
her
than
_
that
_
it
was
better
for
her
not
*NL*
to
marry
him
.
What
a
wonderful
marriage
for
a
girl
like
Miss
*NL*
Tulliver
,
--
quite
romantic
?
Why
,
young
Guest
will
put
up
for
the
*NL*
borough
at
the
next
election
.
Nothing
like
commerce
nowadays
!
That
*NL*
young
Wakem
nearly
went
out
of
his
mind
;
he
always
_
was
_
rather
queer
;
*NL*
but
he
's
gone
abroad
again
to
be
out
of
the
way
,
--
quite
the
best
thing
*NL*
for
a
deformed
young
man
.
Miss
Unit
declares
she
will
never
visit
Mr.
*NL*
and
Mrs.
Stephen
Guest
,
--
such
nonsense
!
pretending
to
be
better
than
*NL*
other
people
.
Society
could
n't
be
carried
on
if
we
inquired
into
*NL*
private
conduct
in
that
way
,
--
and
Christianity
tells
us
to
think
no
*NL*
evil
,
--
and
my
belief
is
,
that
Miss
Unit
had
no
cards
sent
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
results
,
we
know
,
were
not
of
a
kind
to
warrant
this
*NL*
extenuation
of
the
past
.
Maggie
had
returned
without
a
_
trousseau
_
,
*NL*
without
a
husband
,
--
in
that
degraded
and
outcast
condition
to
which
*NL*
error
is
well
known
to
lead
;
and
the
world
's
wife
,
with
that
fine
*NL*
instinct
which
is
given
her
for
the
preservation
of
Society
,
saw
at
*NL*
once
that
Miss
Tulliver
's
conduct
had
been
of
the
most
aggravated
*NL*
kind
.
Could
anything
be
more
detestable
?
A
girl
so
much
indebted
to
*NL*
her
friends
--
whose
mother
as
well
as
herself
had
received
so
much
*NL*
kindness
from
the
Deanes
--
to
lay
the
design
of
winning
a
young
man
's
*NL*
affections
away
from
her
own
cousin
,
who
had
behaved
like
a
sister
to
*NL*
her
!
Winning
his
affections
?
That
was
not
the
phrase
for
such
a
girl
*NL*
as
Miss
Tulliver
;
it
would
have
been
more
correct
to
say
that
she
had
*NL*
been
actuated
by
mere
unwomanly
boldness
and
unbridled
passion
.
There
*NL*
was
always
something
questionable
about
her
.
That
connection
with
*NL*
young
Wakem
,
which
,
they
said
,
had
been
carried
on
for
years
,
looked
*NL*
very
ill
,
--
disgusting
,
in
fact
!
But
with
a
girl
of
that
disposition
!
*NL*
To
the
world
's
wife
there
had
always
been
something
in
Miss
Tulliver
's
*NL*
very
_
physique
_
that
a
refined
instinct
felt
to
be
prophetic
of
harm
.
*NL*
As
for
poor
Mr.
Stephen
Guest
,
he
was
rather
pitiable
than
otherwise
;
*NL*
a
young
man
of
five-and-twenty
is
not
to
be
too
severely
judged
in
*NL*
these
cases
,
--
he
is
really
very
much
at
the
mercy
of
a
designing
,
bold
*NL*
girl
.
And
it
was
clear
that
he
had
given
way
in
spite
of
himself
:
he
*NL*
had
shaken
her
off
as
soon
as
he
could
;
indeed
,
their
having
parted
so
*NL*
soon
looked
very
black
indeed
--
_
for
her
_
.
To
be
sure
,
he
had
written
a
*NL*
letter
,
laying
all
the
blame
on
himself
,
and
telling
the
story
in
a
*NL*
romantic
fashion
so
as
to
try
and
make
her
appear
quite
innocent
;
of
*NL*
course
he
would
do
that
!
But
the
refined
instinct
of
the
world
's
wife
*NL*
was
not
to
be
deceived
;
providentially
!
--
else
what
would
become
of
*NL*
Society
?
Why
,
her
own
brother
had
turned
her
from
his
door
;
he
had
*NL*
seen
enough
,
you
might
be
sure
,
before
he
would
do
that
.
A
truly
*NL*
respectable
young
man
,
Mr.
Tom
Tulliver
;
quite
likely
to
rise
in
the
*NL*
world
!
His
sister
's
disgrace
was
naturally
a
heavy
blow
to
him
.
It
was
*NL*
to
be
hoped
that
she
would
go
out
of
the
neighborhood
,
--
to
America
,
or
*NL*
anywhere
,
--
so
as
to
purify
the
air
of
St.
Ogg
's
from
the
stain
of
her
*NL*
presence
,
extremely
dangerous
to
daughters
there
!
No
good
could
happen
*NL*
to
her
;
it
was
only
to
be
hoped
she
would
repent
,
and
that
God
would
*NL*
have
mercy
on
her
:
He
had
not
the
care
of
society
on
His
hands
,
as
the
*NL*
world
's
wife
had
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
required
nearly
a
fortnight
for
fine
instinct
to
assure
itself
of
*NL*
these
inspirations
;
indeed
,
it
was
a
whole
week
before
Stephen
's
*NL*
letter
came
,
telling
his
father
the
facts
,
and
adding
that
he
was
gone
*NL*
across
to
Holland
,
--
had
drawn
upon
the
agent
at
Mudport
for
*NL*
money
,
--
was
incapable
of
any
resolution
at
present
.
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
,
all
this
while
,
was
too
entirely
filled
with
a
more
agonizing
*NL*
anxiety
to
spend
any
thought
on
the
view
that
was
being
taken
of
her
*NL*
conduct
by
the
world
of
St.
Ogg
's
;
anxiety
about
Stephen
,
Lucy
,
*NL*
Philip
,
beat
on
her
poor
heart
in
a
hard
,
driving
,
ceaseless
storm
of
*NL*
mingled
love
,
remorse
,
and
pity
.
If
she
had
thought
of
rejection
and
*NL*
injustice
at
all
,
it
would
have
seemed
to
her
that
they
had
done
their
*NL*
worst
;
that
she
could
hardly
feel
any
stroke
from
them
intolerable
*NL*
since
the
words
she
had
heard
from
her
brother
's
lips
.
Across
all
her
*NL*
anxiety
for
the
loved
and
the
injured
,
those
words
shot
again
and
*NL*
again
,
like
a
horrible
pang
that
would
have
brought
misery
and
dread
*NL*
even
into
a
heaven
of
delights
.
The
idea
of
ever
recovering
happiness
*NL*
never
glimmered
in
her
mind
for
a
moment
;
it
seemed
as
if
every
*NL*
sensitive
fibre
in
her
were
too
entirely
preoccupied
by
pain
ever
to
*NL*
vibrate
again
to
another
influence
.
Life
stretched
before
her
as
one
*NL*
act
of
penitence
;
and
all
she
craved
,
as
she
dwelt
on
her
future
lot
,
*NL*
was
something
to
guarantee
her
from
more
falling
;
her
own
weakness
*NL*
haunted
her
like
a
vision
of
hideous
possibilities
,
that
made
no
peace
*NL*
conceivable
except
such
as
lay
in
the
sense
of
a
sure
refuge
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
was
not
without
practical
intentions
;
the
love
of
independence
*NL*
was
too
strong
an
inheritance
and
a
habit
for
her
not
to
remember
that
*NL*
she
must
get
her
bread
;
and
when
other
projects
looked
vague
,
she
fell
*NL*
back
on
that
of
returning
to
her
plain
sewing
,
and
so
getting
enough
*NL*
to
pay
for
her
lodging
at
Bob
's
.
She
meant
to
persuade
her
mother
to
*NL*
return
to
the
Mill
by
and
by
,
and
live
with
Tom
again
;
and
somehow
or
*NL*
other
she
would
maintain
herself
at
St.
Ogg
's
.
Dr.
Kenn
would
perhaps
*NL*
help
her
and
advise
her
.
She
remembered
his
parting
words
at
the
*NL*
bazaar
.
She
remembered
the
momentary
feeling
of
reliance
that
had
*NL*
sprung
in
her
when
he
was
talking
with
her
,
and
she
waited
with
*NL*
yearning
expectation
for
the
opportunity
of
confiding
everything
to
*NL*
him
.
Her
mother
called
every
day
at
Mr.
Deane
's
to
learn
how
Lucy
was
;
*NL*
the
report
was
always
sad
,
--
nothing
had
yet
roused
her
from
the
feeble
*NL*
passivity
which
had
come
on
with
the
first
shock
.
But
of
Philip
,
Mrs.
*NL*
Tulliver
had
learned
nothing
;
naturally
,
no
one
whom
she
met
would
*NL*
speak
to
her
about
what
related
to
her
daughter
.
But
at
last
she
*NL*
summoned
courage
to
go
and
see
sister
Glegg
,
who
of
course
would
know
*NL*
everything
,
and
had
been
even
to
see
Tom
at
the
Mill
in
Mrs.
*NL*
Tulliver
's
absence
,
though
he
had
said
nothing
of
what
had
passed
on
*NL*
the
occasion
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
her
mother
was
gone
,
Maggie
put
on
her
bonnet
.
She
had
*NL*
resolved
on
walking
to
the
Rectory
and
asking
to
see
Dr.
Kenn
;
he
was
*NL*
in
deep
grief
,
but
the
grief
of
another
does
not
jar
upon
us
in
such
*NL*
circumstances
.
It
was
the
first
time
she
had
been
beyond
the
door
*NL*
since
her
return
;
nevertheless
her
mind
was
so
bent
on
the
purpose
of
*NL*
her
walk
,
that
the
unpleasantness
of
meeting
people
on
the
way
,
and
*NL*
being
stared
at
,
did
not
occur
to
her
.
But
she
had
no
sooner
passed
*NL*
beyond
the
narrower
streets
which
she
had
to
thread
from
Bob
's
*NL*
dwelling
,
than
she
became
aware
of
unusual
glances
cast
at
her
;
and
*NL*
this
consciousness
made
her
hurry
along
nervously
,
afraid
to
look
to
*NL*
right
or
left
.
Presently
,
however
,
she
came
full
on
Mrs.
and
Miss
*NL*
Turnbull
,
old
acquaintances
of
her
family
;
they
both
looked
at
her
*NL*
strangely
,
and
turned
a
little
aside
without
speaking
.
All
hard
looks
*NL*
were
pain
to
Maggie
,
but
her
self-reproach
was
too
strong
for
*NL*
resentment
.
No
wonder
they
will
not
speak
to
me
,
she
thought
;
they
are
*NL*
very
fond
of
Lucy
.
But
now
she
knew
that
she
was
about
to
pass
a
group
*NL*
of
gentlemen
,
who
were
standing
at
the
door
of
the
billiard-rooms
,
and
*NL*
she
could
not
help
seeing
young
Torry
step
out
a
little
with
his
glass
*NL*
at
his
eye
,
and
bow
to
her
with
that
air
of
_
nonchalance
_
which
he
*NL*
might
have
bestowed
on
a
friendly
barmaid
.
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
's
pride
was
too
intense
for
her
not
to
feel
that
sting
,
even
in
*NL*
the
midst
of
her
sorrow
;
and
for
the
first
time
the
thought
took
*NL*
strong
hold
of
her
that
she
would
have
other
obloquy
cast
on
her
*NL*
besides
that
which
was
felt
to
be
due
to
her
breach
of
faith
toward
*NL*
Lucy
.
But
she
was
at
the
Rectory
now
;
there
,
perhaps
,
she
would
find
*NL*
something
else
than
retribution
.
Retribution
may
come
from
any
voice
;
*NL*
the
hardest
,
cruelest
,
most
imbruted
urchin
at
the
street-corner
can
*NL*
inflict
it
;
surely
help
and
pity
are
rarer
things
,
more
needful
for
*NL*
the
righteous
to
bestow
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
shown
up
at
once
,
after
being
announced
,
into
Dr.
Kenn
's
*NL*
study
,
where
he
sat
amongst
piled-up
books
,
for
which
he
had
little
*NL*
appetite
,
leaning
his
cheek
against
the
head
of
his
youngest
child
,
a
*NL*
girl
of
three
.
The
child
was
sent
away
with
the
servant
,
and
when
the
*NL*
door
was
closed
,
Dr.
Kenn
said
,
placing
a
chair
for
Maggie
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
coming
to
see
you
,
Miss
Tulliver
;
you
have
anticipated
me
;
I
am
*NL*
glad
you
did
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
looked
at
him
with
her
childlike
directness
as
she
had
done
at
*NL*
the
bazaar
,
and
said
,
``
I
want
to
tell
you
everything
.
''
But
her
eyes
*NL*
filled
fast
with
tears
as
she
said
it
,
and
all
the
pent-up
excitement
*NL*
of
her
humiliating
walk
would
have
its
vent
before
she
could
say
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
tell
me
everything
,
''
Dr.
Kenn
said
,
with
quiet
kindness
in
his
*NL*
grave
,
firm
voice
.
``
Think
of
me
as
one
to
whom
a
long
experience
has
*NL*
been
granted
,
which
may
enable
him
to
help
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
rather
broken
sentences
,
and
with
some
effort
at
first
,
but
soon
*NL*
with
the
greater
ease
that
came
from
a
sense
of
relief
in
the
*NL*
confidence
,
Maggie
told
the
brief
story
of
a
struggle
that
must
be
the
*NL*
beginning
of
a
long
sorrow
.
Only
the
day
before
,
Dr.
Kenn
had
been
*NL*
made
acquainted
with
the
contents
of
Stephen
's
letter
,
and
he
had
*NL*
believed
them
at
once
,
without
the
confirmation
of
Maggie
's
statement
.
*NL*
That
involuntary
plaint
of
hers
,
''
_
Oh
,
I
must
go
_
,
''
had
remained
with
*NL*
him
as
the
sign
that
she
was
undergoing
some
inward
conflict
.
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
dwelt
the
longest
on
the
feeling
which
had
made
her
come
back
*NL*
to
her
mother
and
brother
,
which
made
her
cling
to
all
the
memories
of
*NL*
the
past
.
When
she
had
ended
,
Dr.
Kenn
was
silent
for
some
minutes
;
*NL*
there
was
a
difficulty
on
his
mind
.
He
rose
,
and
walked
up
and
down
*NL*
the
hearth
with
his
hands
behind
him
.
At
last
he
seated
himself
again
,
*NL*
and
said
,
looking
at
Maggie
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
prompting
to
go
to
your
nearest
friends
,
--
to
remain
where
all
*NL*
the
ties
of
your
life
have
been
formed
,
--
is
a
true
prompting
,
to
which
*NL*
the
Church
in
its
original
constitution
and
discipline
responds
,
*NL*
opening
its
arms
to
the
penitent
,
watching
over
its
children
to
the
*NL*
last
;
never
abandoning
them
until
they
are
hopelessly
reprobate
.
And
*NL*
the
Church
ought
to
represent
the
feeling
of
the
community
,
so
that
*NL*
every
parish
should
be
a
family
knit
together
by
Christian
brotherhood
*NL*
under
a
spiritual
father
.
But
the
ideas
of
discipline
and
Christian
*NL*
fraternity
are
entirely
relaxed
,
--
they
can
hardly
be
said
to
exist
in
*NL*
the
public
mind
;
they
hardly
survive
except
in
the
partial
,
*NL*
contradictory
form
they
have
taken
in
the
narrow
communities
of
*NL*
schismatics
;
and
if
I
were
not
supported
by
the
firm
faith
that
the
*NL*
Church
must
ultimately
recover
the
full
force
of
that
constitution
*NL*
which
is
alone
fitted
to
human
needs
,
I
should
often
lose
heart
at
*NL*
observing
the
want
of
fellowship
and
sense
of
mutual
responsibility
*NL*
among
my
own
flock
.
At
present
everything
seems
tending
toward
the
*NL*
relaxation
of
ties
,
--
toward
the
substitution
of
wayward
choice
for
the
*NL*
adherence
to
obligation
,
which
has
its
roots
in
the
past
.
Your
*NL*
conscience
and
your
heart
have
given
you
true
light
on
this
point
,
*NL*
Miss
Tulliver
;
and
I
have
said
all
this
that
you
may
know
what
my
wish
*NL*
about
you
--
what
my
advice
to
you
--
would
be
,
if
they
sprang
from
my
own
*NL*
feeling
and
opinion
unmodified
by
counteracting
circumstances
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dr.
Kenn
paused
a
little
while
.
There
was
an
entire
absence
of
*NL*
effusive
benevolence
in
his
manner
;
there
was
something
almost
cold
in
*NL*
the
gravity
of
his
look
and
voice
.
If
Maggie
had
not
known
that
his
*NL*
benevolence
was
persevering
in
proportion
to
its
reserve
,
she
might
*NL*
have
been
chilled
and
frightened
.
As
it
was
,
she
listened
expectantly
,
*NL*
quite
sure
that
there
would
be
some
effective
help
in
his
words
.
He
*NL*
went
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
inexperience
of
the
world
,
Miss
Tulliver
,
prevents
you
from
*NL*
anticipating
fully
the
very
unjust
conceptions
that
will
probably
be
*NL*
formed
concerning
your
conduct
,
--
conceptions
which
will
have
a
baneful
*NL*
effect
,
even
in
spite
of
known
evidence
to
disprove
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
do
,
--
I
begin
to
see
,
''
said
Maggie
,
unable
to
repress
this
*NL*
utterance
of
her
recent
pain
.
``
I
know
I
shall
be
insulted
.
I
shall
be
*NL*
thought
worse
than
I
am
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
perhaps
do
not
yet
know
,
''
said
Dr.
Kenn
,
with
a
touch
of
more
*NL*
personal
pity
,
``
that
a
letter
is
come
which
ought
to
satisfy
every
one
*NL*
who
has
known
anything
of
you
,
that
you
chose
the
steep
and
difficult
*NL*
path
of
a
return
to
the
right
,
at
the
moment
when
that
return
was
most
*NL*
of
all
difficult
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
where
is
he
?
''
said
poor
Maggie
,
with
a
flush
and
tremor
that
no
*NL*
presence
could
have
hindered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
gone
abroad
;
he
has
written
of
all
that
passed
to
his
father
.
*NL*
He
has
vindicated
you
to
the
utmost
;
and
I
hope
the
communication
of
*NL*
that
letter
to
your
cousin
will
have
a
beneficial
effect
on
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dr.
Kenn
waited
for
her
to
get
calm
again
before
he
went
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
letter
,
as
I
said
,
ought
to
suffice
to
prevent
false
impressions
*NL*
concerning
you
.
But
I
am
bound
to
tell
you
,
Miss
Tulliver
,
that
not
*NL*
only
the
experience
of
my
whole
life
,
but
my
observation
within
the
*NL*
last
three
days
,
makes
me
fear
that
there
is
hardly
any
evidence
which
*NL*
will
save
you
from
the
painful
effect
of
false
imputations
.
The
*NL*
persons
who
are
the
most
incapable
of
a
conscientious
struggle
such
as
*NL*
yours
are
precisely
those
who
will
be
likely
to
shrink
from
you
,
*NL*
because
they
will
not
believe
in
your
struggle
.
I
fear
your
life
here
*NL*
will
be
attended
not
only
with
much
pain
,
but
with
many
obstructions
.
*NL*
For
this
reason
--
and
for
this
only
--
I
ask
you
to
consider
whether
it
*NL*
will
not
perhaps
be
better
for
you
to
take
a
situation
at
a
distance
,
*NL*
according
to
your
former
intention
.
I
will
exert
myself
at
once
to
*NL*
obtain
one
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
if
I
could
but
stop
here
!
''
said
Maggie
.
``
I
have
no
heart
to
begin
*NL*
a
strange
life
again
.
I
should
have
no
stay
.
I
should
feel
like
a
*NL*
lonely
wanderer
,
cut
off
from
the
past
.
I
have
written
to
the
lady
who
*NL*
offered
me
a
situation
to
excuse
myself
.
If
I
remained
here
,
I
could
*NL*
perhaps
atone
in
some
way
to
Lucy
--
to
others
;
I
could
convince
them
*NL*
that
I
'm
sorry
.
And
,
''
she
added
,
with
some
of
the
old
proud
fire
*NL*
flashing
out
,
``
I
will
not
go
away
because
people
say
false
things
of
*NL*
me
.
They
shall
learn
to
retract
them
.
If
I
must
go
away
at
last
,
*NL*
because
--
because
others
wish
it
,
I
will
not
go
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Dr.
Kenn
,
after
some
consideration
,
``
if
you
determine
on
*NL*
that
,
Miss
Tulliver
,
you
may
rely
on
all
the
influence
my
position
*NL*
gives
me
.
I
am
bound
to
aid
and
countenance
you
by
the
very
duties
of
*NL*
my
office
as
a
parish
priest
.
I
will
add
,
that
personally
I
have
a
*NL*
deep
interest
in
your
peace
of
mind
and
welfare
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
only
thing
I
want
is
some
occupation
that
will
enable
me
to
get
*NL*
my
bread
and
be
independent
,
''
said
Maggie
.
``
I
shall
not
want
much
.
I
*NL*
can
go
on
lodging
where
I
am
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
think
over
the
subject
maturely
,
''
said
Dr.
Kenn
,
``
and
in
a
few
*NL*
days
I
shall
be
better
able
to
ascertain
the
general
feeling
.
I
shall
*NL*
come
to
see
you
;
I
shall
bear
you
constantly
in
mind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
Maggie
had
left
him
,
Dr.
Kenn
stood
ruminating
with
his
hands
*NL*
behind
him
,
and
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
carpet
,
under
a
painful
sense
of
*NL*
doubt
and
difficulty
.
The
tone
of
Stephen
's
letter
,
which
he
had
read
,
*NL*
and
the
actual
relations
of
all
the
persons
concerned
,
forced
upon
him
*NL*
powerfully
the
idea
of
an
ultimate
marriage
between
Stephen
and
Maggie
*NL*
as
the
least
evil
;
and
the
impossibility
of
their
proximity
in
St.
*NL*
Ogg
's
on
any
other
supposition
,
until
after
years
of
separation
,
threw
*NL*
an
insurmountable
prospective
difficulty
over
Maggie
's
stay
there
.
On
*NL*
the
other
hand
,
he
entered
with
all
the
comprehension
of
a
man
who
had
*NL*
known
spiritual
conflict
,
and
lived
through
years
of
devoted
service
*NL*
to
his
fellow-men
,
into
that
state
of
Maggie
's
heart
and
conscience
*NL*
which
made
the
consent
to
the
marriage
a
desecration
to
her
;
her
*NL*
conscience
must
not
be
tampered
with
;
the
principle
on
which
she
had
*NL*
acted
was
a
safer
guide
than
any
balancing
of
consequences
.
His
*NL*
experience
told
him
that
intervention
was
too
dubious
a
responsibility
*NL*
to
be
lightly
incurred
;
the
possible
issue
either
of
an
endeavor
to
*NL*
restore
the
former
relations
with
Lucy
and
Philip
,
or
of
counselling
*NL*
submission
to
this
irruption
of
a
new
feeling
,
was
hidden
in
a
*NL*
darkness
all
the
more
impenetrable
because
each
immediate
step
was
*NL*
clogged
with
evil
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
great
problem
of
the
shifting
relation
between
passion
and
duty
is
*NL*
clear
to
no
man
who
is
capable
of
apprehending
it
;
the
question
*NL*
whether
the
moment
has
come
in
which
a
man
has
fallen
below
the
*NL*
possibility
of
a
renunciation
that
will
carry
any
efficacy
,
and
must
*NL*
accept
the
sway
of
a
passion
against
which
he
had
struggled
as
a
*NL*
trespass
,
is
one
for
which
we
have
no
master-key
that
will
fit
all
*NL*
cases
.
The
casuists
have
become
a
byword
of
reproach
;
but
their
*NL*
perverted
spirit
of
minute
discrimination
was
the
shadow
of
a
truth
to
*NL*
which
eyes
and
hearts
are
too
often
fatally
sealed
,
--
the
truth
,
that
*NL*
moral
judgments
must
remain
false
and
hollow
,
unless
they
are
checked
*NL*
and
enlightened
by
a
perpetual
reference

the
special

*NL*
that

*NL*
*NL*
All
people
of
broad
,
strong
sense
have
an
instinctive
repugnance
to
*NL*
the
men
of
maxims
;
because
such
people
early
discern
that
the
*NL*
mysterious
complexity
of
our
life
is
not
to
be
embraced
by
maxims
,
and
*NL*
that
to
lace
ourselves
up
in
formulas
of
that
sort
is
to
repress
all
*NL*
the
divine
promptings
and
inspirations
that
spring
from
growing
*NL*
insight
and
sympathy
.
And
the
man
of
maxims
is
the
popular
*NL*
representative
of
the
minds
that
are
guided
in
their
moral
judgment
*NL*
solely
by
general
rules
,
thinking
that
these
will
lead
them
to
justice
*NL*
by
a
ready-made
patent
method
,
without
the
trouble
of
exerting
*NL*
patience
,
discrimination
,
impartiality
,
--
without
any
care
to
assure
*NL*
themselves
whether
they
have
the
insight
that
comes
from
a
hardly
*NL*
earned
estimate
of
temptation
,
or
from
a
life
vivid
and
intense
enough
*NL*
to
have
created
a
wide
fellow-feeling
with
all
that
is
human

Chapter

Showing
That
Old
Acquaintances
Are
Capable
of
Surprising
Us
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
Maggie
was
at
home
again
,
her
mother
brought
her
news
of
an
*NL*
unexpected
line
of
conduct
in
aunt
Glegg
.
As
long
as
Maggie
had
not
*NL*
been
heard
of
,
Mrs.
Glegg
had
half
closed
her
shutters
and
drawn
down
*NL*
her
blinds
.
She
felt
assured
that
Maggie
was
drowned
;
that
was
far
*NL*
more
probable
than
that
her
niece
and
legatee
should
have
done
*NL*
anything
to
wound
the
family
honor
in
the
tenderest
point
.
When
at
*NL*
last
she
learned
from
Tom
that
Maggie
had
come
home
,
and
gathered
from
*NL*
him
what
was
her
explanation
of
her
absence
,
she
burst
forth
in
severe
*NL*
reproof
of
Tom
for
admitting
the
worst
of
his
sister
until
he
was
*NL*
compelled
.
If
you
were
not
to
stand
by
your
``
kin
''
as
long
as
there
was
*NL*
a
shred
of
honor
attributable
to
them
,
pray
what
were
you
to
stand
by
?
*NL*
Lightly
to
admit
conduct
in
one
of
your
own
family
that
would
force
*NL*
you
to
alter
your
will
,
had
never
been
the
way
of
the
Dodsons
;
and
*NL*
though
Mrs.
Glegg
had
always
augured
ill
of
Maggie
's
future
at
a
time
*NL*
when
other
people
were
perhaps
less
clear-sighted
,
yet
fair
play
was
a
*NL*
jewel
,
and
it
was
not
for
her
own
friends
to
help
to
rob
the
girl
of
*NL*
her
fair
fame
,
and
to
cast
her
out
from
family
shelter
to
the
scorn
of
*NL*
the
outer
world
,
until
she
had
become
unequivocally
a
family
disgrace
.
*NL*
The
circumstances
were
unprecedented
in
Mrs.
Glegg
's
experience
;
*NL*
nothing
of
that
kind
had
happened
among
the
Dodsons
before
;
but
it
was
*NL*
a
case
in
which
her
hereditary
rectitude
and
personal
strength
of
*NL*
character
found
a
common
channel
along
with
her
fundamental
ideas
of
*NL*
clanship
,
as
they
did
in
her
lifelong
regard
to
equity
in
money
*NL*
matters
.
She
quarrelled
with
Mr.
Glegg
,
whose
kindness
,
flowing
*NL*
entirely
into
compassion
for
Lucy
,
made
him
as
hard
in
his
judgment
of
*NL*
Maggie
as
Mr.
Deane
himself
was
;
and
fuming
against
her
sister
*NL*
Tulliver
because
she
did
not
at
once
come
to
her
for
advice
and
help
,
*NL*
shut
herself
up
in
her
own
room
with
Baxter
's
``
Saints
'
Rest
''
from
*NL*
morning
till
night
,
denying
herself
to
all
visitors
,
till
Mr.
Glegg
*NL*
brought
from
Mr.
Deane
the
news
of
Stephen
's
letter
.
Then
Mrs.
Glegg
*NL*
felt
that
she
had
adequate
fighting-ground
;
then
she
laid
aside
*NL*
Baxter
,
and
was
ready
to
meet
all
comers
.
While
Mrs.
Pullet
could
do
*NL*
nothing
but
shake
her
head
and
cry
,
and
wish
that
cousin
Abbot
had
*NL*
died
,
or
any
number
of
funerals
had
happened
rather
than
this
,
which
*NL*
had
never
happened
before
,
so
that
there
was
no
knowing
how
to
act
,
*NL*
and
Mrs.
Pullet
could
never
enter
St.
Ogg
's
again
,
because
*NL*
``
acquaintances
''
knew
of
it
all
,
Mrs.
Glegg
only
hoped
that
Mrs.
Wooll
,
*NL*
or
any
one
else
,
would
come
to
her
with
their
false
tales
about
her
*NL*
own
niece
,
and
she
would
know
what
to
say
to
that
ill-advised
person
!
*NL*
*NL*
Again
she
had
a
scene
of
remonstrance
with
Tom
,
all
the
more
severe
in
*NL*
proportion
to
the
greater
strength
of
her
present
position
.
But
Tom
,
*NL*
like
other
immovable
things
,
seemed
only
the
more
rigidly
fixed
under
*NL*
that
attempt
to
shake
him
.
Poor
Tom
!
he
judged
by
what
he
had
been
*NL*
able
to
see
;
and
the
judgment
was
painful
enough
to
himself
.
He
*NL*
thought
he
had
the
demonstration
of
facts
observed
through
years
by
*NL*
his
own
eyes
,
which
gave
no
warning
of
their
imperfection
,
that
*NL*
Maggie
's
nature
was
utterly
untrustworthy
,
and
too
strongly
marked
*NL*
with
evil
tendencies
to
be
safely
treated
with
leniency
.
He
would
act
*NL*
on
that
demonstration
at
any
cost
;
but
the
thought
of
it
made
his
days
*NL*
bitter
to
him
.
Tom
,
like
every
one
of
us
,
was
imprisoned
within
the
*NL*
limits
of
his
own
nature
,
and
his
education
had
simply
glided
over
*NL*
him
,
leaving
a
slight
deposit
of
polish
;
if
you
are
inclined
to
be
*NL*
severe
on
his
severity
,
remember
that
the
responsibility
of
tolerance
*NL*
lies
with
those
who
have
the
wider
vision
.
There
had
arisen
in
Tom
a
*NL*
repulsion
toward
Maggie
that
derived
its
very
intensity
from
their
*NL*
early
childish
love
in
the
time
when
they
had
clasped
tiny
fingers
*NL*
together
,
and
their
later
sense
of
nearness
in
a
common
duty
and
a
*NL*
common
sorrow
;
the
sight
of
her
,
as
he
had
told
her
,
was
hateful
to
*NL*
him
.
In
this
branch
of
the
Dodson
family
aunt
Glegg
found
a
stronger
*NL*
nature
than
her
own
;
a
nature
in
which
family
feeling
had
lost
the
*NL*
character
of
clanship
by
taking
on
a
doubly
deep
dye
of
personal
*NL*
pride
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Glegg
allowed
that
Maggie
ought
to
be
punished
,
--
she
was
not
a
*NL*
woman
to
deny
that
;
she
knew
what
conduct
was
,
--
but
punished
in
*NL*
proportion
to
the
misdeeds
proved
against
her
,
not
to
those
which
were
*NL*
cast
upon
her
by
people
outside
her
own
family
who
might
wish
to
show
*NL*
that
their
own
kin
were
better
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
aunt
Glegg
scolded
me
so
as
niver
was
,
my
dear
,
''
said
poor
Mrs.
*NL*
Tulliver
,
when
she
came
back
to
Maggie
,
``
as
I
did
n't
go
to
her
before
;
*NL*
she
said
it
was
n't
for
her
to
come
to
me
first
.
But
she
spoke
like
a
*NL*
sister
,
too
;
_
having
_
she
allays
was
,
and
hard
to
please
,
--
oh
*NL*
dear
!
--
but
she
's
said
the
kindest
word
as
has
ever
been
spoke
by
you
*NL*
yet
,
my
child
.
For
she
says
,
for
all
she
's
been
so
set
again
'
having
*NL*
one
extry
in
the
house
,
and
making
extry
spoons
and
things
,
and
*NL*
putting
her
about
in
her
ways
,
you
shall
have
a
shelter
in
her
house
,
*NL*
if
you
'll
go
to
her
dutiful
,
and
she
'll
uphold
you
against
folks
as
*NL*
say
harm
of
you
when
they
've
no
call
.
And
I
told
her
I
thought
you
*NL*
could
n't
bear
to
see
anybody
but
me
,
you
were
so
beat
down
with
*NL*
trouble
;
but
she
said
,
'
_
I
_
wo
n't
throw
ill
words
at
her
;
there
's
them
*NL*
out
o
'
th
'
family
`
ull
be
ready
enough
to
do
that
.
But
I
'll
give
her
*NL*
good
advice
;
an
'
she
must
be
humble
.
'
It
's
wonderful
o
'
Jane
;
for
I
'm
*NL*
sure
she
used
to
throw
everything
I
did
wrong
at
me
,
--
if
it
was
the
*NL*
raisin-wine
as
turned
out
bad
,
or
the
pies
too
hot
,
or
whativer
it
*NL*
was
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
mother
,
''
said
poor
Maggie
,
shrinking
from
the
thought
of
all
the
*NL*
contact
her
bruised
mind
would
have
to
bear
,
``
tell
her
I
'm
very
*NL*
grateful
;
I
'll
go
to
see
her
as
soon
as
I
can
;
but
I
ca
n't
see
any
one
*NL*
just
yet
,
except
Dr.
Kenn
.
I
've
been
to
him
,
--
he
will
advise
me
,
and
*NL*
help
me
to
get
some
occupation
.
I
ca
n't
live
with
any
one
,
or
be
*NL*
dependent
on
them
,
tell
aunt
Glegg
;
I
must
get
my
own
bread
.
But
did
*NL*
you
hear
nothing
of
Philip
--
Philip
Wakem
?
Have
you
never
seen
any
one
*NL*
that
has
mentioned
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
my
dear
;
but
I
've
been
to
Lucy
's
,
and
I
saw
your
uncle
,
and
he
*NL*
says
they
got
her
to
listen
to
the
letter
,
and
she
took
notice
o
'
Miss
*NL*
Guest
,
and
asked
questions
,
and
the
doctor
thinks
she
's
on
the
turn
to
*NL*
be
better
.
What
a
world
this
is
,
--
what
trouble
,
oh
dear
!
The
law
was
*NL*
the
first
beginning
,
and
it
's
gone
from
bad
to
worse
,
all
of
a
sudden
,
*NL*
just
when
the
luck
seemed
on
the
turn
?
''
This
was
the
first
lamentation
*NL*
that
Mrs.
Tulliver
had
let
slip
to
Maggie
,
but
old
habit
had
been
*NL*
revived
by
the
interview
with
sister
Glegg
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
poor
,
poor
mother
!
''
Maggie
burst
out
,
cut
to
the
heart
with
pity
*NL*
and
compunction
,
and
throwing
her
arms
round
her
mother
's
neck
;
``
I
was
*NL*
always
naughty
and
troublesome
to
you
.
And
now
you
might
have
been
*NL*
happy
if
it
had
n't
been
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
,
my
dear
,
''
said
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
leaning
toward
the
warm
young
*NL*
cheek
;
``
I
must
put
up
wi
'
my
children
,
--
I
shall
never
have
no
more
;
*NL*
and
if
they
bring
me
bad
luck
,
I
must
be
fond
on
it
.
There
's
nothing
*NL*
else
much
to
be
fond
on
,
for
my
furnitur
'
went
long
ago
.
And
you
'd
got
*NL*
to
be
very
good
once
;
I
ca
n't
think
how
it
's
turned
out
the
wrong
way
*NL*
so
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Still
two
or
three
more
days
passed
,
and
Maggie
heard
nothing
of
*NL*
Philip
;
anxiety
about
him
was
becoming
her
predominant
trouble
,
and
*NL*
she
summoned
courage
at
last
to
inquire
about
him
of
Dr.
Kenn
,
on
his
*NL*
next
visit
to
her
.
He
did
not
even
know
if
Philip
was
at
home
.
The
*NL*
elder
Wakem
was
made
moody
by
an
accumulation
of
annoyance
;
the
*NL*
disappointment
in
this
young
Jetsome
,
to
whom
,
apparently
,
he
was
a
*NL*
good
deal
attached
,
had
been
followed
close
by
the
catastrophe
to
his
*NL*
son
's
hopes
after
he
had
done
violence
to
his
own
strong
feeling
by
*NL*
conceding
to
them
,
and
had
incautiously
mentioned
this
concession
in
*NL*
St.
Ogg
's
;
and
he
was
almost
fierce
in
his
brusqueness
when
any
one
*NL*
asked
him
a
question
about
his
son
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Philip
could
hardly
have
been
ill
,
or
it
would
have
been
known
*NL*
through
the
calling
in
of
the
medical
man
;
it
was
probable
that
he
was
*NL*
gone
out
of
the
town
for
a
little
while
.
Maggie
sickened
under
this
*NL*
suspense
,
and
her
imagination
began
to
live
more
and
more
persistently
*NL*
in
what
Philip
was
enduring
.
What
did
he
believe
about
her
?
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
Bob
brought
her
a
letter
,
without
a
postmark
,
directed
in
a
*NL*
hand
which
she
knew
familiarly
in
the
letters
of
her
own
name
,
--
a
hand
*NL*
in
which
her
name
had
been
written
long
ago
,
in
a
pocket
Shakespeare
*NL*
which
she
possessed
.
Her
mother
was
in
the
room
,
and
Maggie
,
in
*NL*
violent
agitation
,
hurried
upstairs
that
she
might
read
the
letter
in
*NL*
solitude
.
She
read
it
with
a
throbbing
brow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Maggie
,
--
I
believe
in
you
;
I
know
you
never
meant
to
deceive
me
;
I
*NL*
know
you
tried
to
keep
faith
to
me
and
to
all
.
I
believed
this
*NL*
before
I
had
any
other
evidence
of
it
than
your
own
nature
.
The
*NL*
night
after
I
last
parted
from
you
I
suffered
torments
.
I
had
seen
*NL*
what
convinced
me
that
you
were
not
free
;
that
there
was
another
*NL*
whose
presence
had
a
power
over
you
which
mine
never
possessed
;
but
*NL*
through
all
the
suggestions
--
almost
murderous
suggestions
--
of
rage
*NL*
and
jealousy
,
my
mind
made
its
way
to
believe
in
your
truthfulness
.
*NL*
I
was
sure
that
you
meant
to
cleave
to
me
,
as
you
had
said
;
that
*NL*
you
had
rejected
him
;
that
you
struggled
to
renounce
him
,
for
*NL*
Lucy
's
sake
and
for
mine
.
But
I
could
see
no
issue
that
was
not
*NL*
fatal
for
_
you
;
_
and
that
dread
shut
out
the
very
thought
of
*NL*
resignation
.
I
foresaw
that
he
would
not
relinquish
you
,
and
I
*NL*
believed
then
,
as
I
believe
now
,
that
the
strong
attraction
which
*NL*
drew
you
together
proceeded
only
from
one
side
of
your
characters
,
*NL*
and
belonged
to
that
partial
,
divided
action
of
our
nature
which
*NL*
makes
half
the
tragedy
of
the
human
lot
.
I
have
felt
the
vibration
*NL*
of
chords
in
your
nature
that
I
have
continually
felt
the
want
of
*NL*
in
his
.
But
perhaps
I
am
wrong
;
perhaps
I
feel
about
you
as
the
*NL*
artist
does
about
the
scene
over
which
his
soul
has
brooded
with
*NL*
love
;
he
would
tremble
to
see
it
confided
to
other
hands
;
he
would
*NL*
never
believe
that
it
could
bear
for
another
all
the
meaning
and
*NL*
the
beauty
it
bears
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
dared
not
trust
myself
to
see
you
that
morning
;
I
was
filled
*NL*
with
selfish
passion
;
I
was
shattered
by
a
night
of
conscious
*NL*
delirium
.
I
told
you
long
ago
that
I
had
never
been
resigned
even
*NL*
to
the
mediocrity
of
my
powers
;
how
could
I
be
resigned
to
the
loss
*NL*
of
the
one
thing
which
had
ever
come
to
me
on
earth
with
the
*NL*
promise
of
such
deep
joy
as
would
give
a
new
and
blessed
meaning
to
*NL*
the
foregoing
pain
,
--
the
promise
of
another
self
that
would
lift
my
*NL*
aching
affection
into
the
divine
rapture
of
an
ever-springing
,
*NL*
ever-satisfied
want
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
the
miseries
of
that
night
had
prepared
me
for
what
came
*NL*
before
the
next
.
It
was
no
surprise
to
me
.
I
was
certain
that
he
*NL*
had
prevailed
on
you
to
sacrifice
everything
to
him
,
and
I
waited
*NL*
with
equal
certainty
to
hear
of
your
marriage
.
I
measured
your
love
*NL*
and
his
by
my
own
.
But
I
was
wrong
,
Maggie
.
There
is
something
*NL*
stronger
in
you
than
your
love
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
not
tell
you
what
I
went
through
in
that
interval
.
But
even
*NL*
in
its
utmost
agony
--
even
in
those
terrible
throes
that
love
must
*NL*
suffer
before
it
can
be
disembodied
of
selfish
desire
--
my
love
for
*NL*
you
sufficed
to
withhold
me
from
suicide
,
without
the
aid
of
any
*NL*
other
motive
.
In
the
midst
of
my
egoism
,
I
yet
could
not
bear
to
*NL*
come
like
a
death-shadow
across
the
feast
of
your
joy
.
I
could
not
*NL*
bear
to
forsake
the
world
in
which
you
still
lived
and
might
need
*NL*
me
;
it
was
part
of
the
faith
I
had
vowed
to
you
,
--
to
wait
and
*NL*
endure
.
Maggie
,
that
is
a
proof
of
what
I
write
now
to
assure
you
*NL*
of
,
--
that
no
anguish
I
have
had
to
bear
on
your
account
has
been
*NL*
too
heavy
a
price
to
pay
for
the
new
life
into
which
I
have
entered
*NL*
in
loving
you
.
I
want
you
to
put
aside
all
grief
because
of
the
*NL*
grief
you
have
caused
me
.
I
was
nurtured
in
the
sense
of
privation
;
*NL*
I
never
expected
happiness
;
and
in
knowing
you
,
in
loving
you
,
I
*NL*
have
had
,
and
still
have
,
what
reconciles
me
to
life
.
You
have
been
*NL*
to
my
affections
what
light
,
what
color
is
to
my
eyes
,
what
music
*NL*
is
to
the
inward
ear
,
you
have
raised
a
dim
unrest
into
a
vivid
*NL*
consciousness
.
The
new
life
I
have
found
in
caring
for
your
joy
and
*NL*
sorrow
more
than
for
what
is
directly
my
own
,
has
transformed
the
*NL*
spirit
of
rebellious
murmuring
into
that
willing
endurance
which
is
*NL*
the
birth
of
strong
sympathy
.
I
think
nothing
but
such
complete
and
*NL*
intense
love
could
have
initiated
me
into
that
enlarged
life
which
*NL*
grows
and
grows
by
appropriating
the
life
of
others
;
for
before
,
I
*NL*
was
always
dragged
back
from
it
by
ever-present
painful
*NL*
self-consciousness
.
I
even
think
sometimes
that
this
gift
of
*NL*
transferred
life
which
has
come
to
me
in
loving
you
,
may
be
a
new
*NL*
power
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
dear
one
,
in
spite
of
all
,
you
have
been
the
blessing
of
my
*NL*
life
.
Let
no
self-reproach
weigh
on
you
because
of
me
.
It
is
I
who
*NL*
should
rather
reproach
myself
for
having
urged
my
feelings
upon
*NL*
you
,
and
hurried
you
into
words
that
you
have
felt
as
fetters
.
You
*NL*
meant
to
be
true
to
those
words
;
you
_
have
_
been
true
.
I
can
*NL*
measure
your
sacrifice
by
what
I
have
known
in
only
one
half-hour
*NL*
of
your
presence
with
me
,
when
I
dreamed
that
you
might
love
me
*NL*
best
.
But
,
Maggie
,
I
have
no
just
claim
on
you
for
more
than
*NL*
affectionate
remembrance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
some
time
I
have
shrunk
from
writing
to
you
,
because
I
have
*NL*
shrunk
even
from
the
appearance
of
wishing
to
thrust
myself
before
*NL*
you
,
and
so
repeating
my
original
error
.
But
you
will
not
*NL*
misconstrue
me
.
I
know
that
we
must
keep
apart
for
a
long
while
;
*NL*
cruel
tongues
would
force
us
apart
,
if
nothing
else
did
.
But
I
*NL*
shall
not
go
away
.
The
place
where
you
are
is
the
one
where
my
mind
*NL*
must
live
,
wherever
I
might
travel
.
And
remember
that
I
am
*NL*
unchangeably
yours
,
--
yours
not
with
selfish
wishes
,
but
with
a
*NL*
devotion
that
excludes
such
wishes

*NL*
``
God
comfort
you

my
loving

large-souled
Maggie

If
every
one
else

has
misconceived
you

remember
that
you
have
never
been
doubted
by
*NL*
him
whose
heart
recognized
you
ten
years
ago

*NL*
``
Do
not

I
have
only
had
nervous
headaches

no
worse
than
I

have
sometimes
had
them
before

But
the
overpowering
heat
inclines
*NL*
me
to
be
perfectly
quiescent
in
the
daytime

I

strong

As
Maggie
knelt
by
the

sobbing
,
with
that
letter
pressed
under
*NL*
her
,
her
feelings
again
and
again
gathered
themselves
in

in

Chapter
IV
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
and
Lucy
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
By
the
end
of
the
week
Dr.
Kenn
had
made
up
his
mind
that
there
was
*NL*
only
one
way
in
which
he
could
secure
to
Maggie
a
suitable
living
at
*NL*
St.
Ogg
's
.
Even
with
his
twenty
years
'
experience
as
a
parish
priest
,
*NL*
he
was
aghast
at
the
obstinate
continuance
of
imputations
against
her
*NL*
in
the
face
of
evidence
.
Hitherto
he
had
been
rather
more
adored
and
*NL*
appealed
to
than
was
quite
agreeable
to
him
;
but
now
,
in
attempting
to
*NL*
open
the
ears
of
women
to
reason
,
and
their
consciences
to
justice
,
on
*NL*
behalf
of
Maggie
Tulliver
,
he
suddenly
found
himself
as
powerless
as
*NL*
he
was
aware
he
would
have
been
if
he
had
attempted
to
influence
the
*NL*
shape
of
bonnets
.
Dr.
Kenn
could
not
be
contradicted
;
he
was
listened
*NL*
to
in
silence
;
but
when
he
left
the
room
,
a
comparison
of
opinions
*NL*
among
his
hearers
yielded
much
the
same
result
as
before
.
Miss
*NL*
Tulliver
had
undeniably
acted
in
a
blamable
manner
,
even
Dr.
Kenn
did
*NL*
not
deny
that
;
how
,
then
,
could
he
think
so
lightly
of
her
as
to
put
*NL*
that
favorable
interpretation
on
everything
she
had
done
?
Even
on
the
*NL*
supposition
that
required
the
utmost
stretch
of
belief
,
--
namely
,
that
*NL*
none
of
the
things
said
about
Miss
Tulliver
were
true
,
--
still
,
since
*NL*
they
_
had
_
been
said
about
her
,
they
had
cast
an
odor
round
her
which
*NL*
must
cause
her
to
be
shrunk
from
by
every
woman
who
had
to
take
care
*NL*
of
her
own
reputation
--
and
of
Society
.
To
have
taken
Maggie
by
the
*NL*
hand
and
said
,
``
I
will
not
believe
unproved
evil
of
you
;
my
lips
shall
*NL*
not
utter
it
;
my
ears
shall
be
closed
against
it
;
I
,
too
,
am
an
erring
*NL*
mortal
,
liable
to
stumble
,
apt
to
come
short
of
my
most
earnest
*NL*
efforts
;
your
lot
has
been
harder
than
mine
,
your
temptation
greater
;
*NL*
let
us
help
each
other
to
stand
and
walk
without
more
falling
,
''
--
to
*NL*
have
done
this
would
have
demanded
courage
,
deep
pity
,
self-knowledge
,
*NL*
generous
trust
;
would
have
demanded
a
mind
that
tasted
no
piquancy
in
*NL*
evil-speaking
,
that
felt
no
self-exaltation
in
condemning
,
that
*NL*
cheated
itself
with
no
large
words
into
the
belief
that
life
can
have
*NL*
any
moral
end
,
any
high
religion
,
which
excludes
the
striving
after
*NL*
perfect
truth
,
justice
,
and
love
toward
the
individual
men
and
women
*NL*
who
come
across
our
own
path
.
The
ladies
of
St.
Ogg
's
were
not
*NL*
beguiled
by
any
wide
speculative
conceptions
;
but
they
had
their
*NL*
favorite
abstraction
,
called
Society
,
which
served
to
make
their
*NL*
consciences
perfectly
easy
in
doing
what
satisfied
their
own
*NL*
egoism
,
--
thinking
and
speaking
the
worst
of
Maggie
Tulliver
,
and
*NL*
turning
their
backs
upon
her
.
It
was
naturally
disappointing
to
Dr.
*NL*
Kenn
,
after
two
years
of
superfluous
incense
from
his
feminine
*NL*
parishioners
,
to
find
them
suddenly
maintaining
their
views
in
*NL*
opposition
to
his
;
but
then
they
maintained
them
in
opposition
to
a
*NL*
higher
Authority
,
which
they
had
venerated
longer
.
That
Authority
had
*NL*
furnished
a
very
explicit
answer
to
persons
who
might
inquire
where
*NL*
their
social
duties
began
,
and
might
be
inclined
to
take
wide
views
as
*NL*
to
the
starting-point
.
The
answer
had
not
turned
on
the
ultimate
good
*NL*
of
Society
,
but
on
``
a
certain
man
''
who
was
found
in
trouble
by
the
*NL*
wayside
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
that
St.
Ogg
's
was
empty
of
women
with
some
tenderness
of
heart
*NL*
and
conscience
;
probably
it
had
as
fair
a
proportion
of
human
goodness
*NL*
in
it
as
any
other
small
trading
town
of
that
day
.
But
until
every
*NL*
good
man
is
brave
,
we
must
expect
to
find
many
good
women
timid
,
--
too
*NL*
timid
even
to
believe
in
the
correctness
of
their
own
best
promptings
,
*NL*
when
these
would
place
them
in
a
minority
.
And
the
men
at
St.
Ogg
's
*NL*
were
not
all
brave
,
by
any
means
;
some
of
them
were
even
fond
of
*NL*
scandal
,
and
to
an
extent
that
might
have
given
their
conversation
an
*NL*
effeminate
character
,
if
it
had
not
been
distinguished
by
masculine
*NL*
jokes
,
and
by
an
occasional
shrug
of
the
shoulders
at
the
mutual
*NL*
hatred
of
women
.
It
was
the
general
feeling
of
the
masculine
mind
at
*NL*
St.
Ogg
's
that
women
were
not
to
be
interfered
with
in
their
treatment
*NL*
of
each
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
thus
every
direction
in
which
Dr.
Kenn
had
turned
,
in
the
hope
of
*NL*
procuring
some
kind
recognition
and
some
employment
for
Maggie
,
proved
*NL*
a
disappointment
to
him
.
Mrs.
James
Torry
could
not
think
of
taking
*NL*
Maggie
as
a
nursery
governess
,
even
temporarily
,
--
a
young
woman
about
*NL*
whom
``
such
things
had
been
said
,
''
and
about
whom
``
gentlemen
joked
''
;
*NL*
and
Miss
Kirke
,
who
had
a
spinal
complaint
,
and
wanted
a
reader
and
*NL*
companion
,
felt
quite
sure
that
Maggie
's
mind
must
be
of
a
quality
*NL*
with
which
she
,
for
her
part
,
could
not
risk
_
any
_
contact
.
Why
did
*NL*
not
Miss
Tulliver
accept
the
shelter
offered
her
by
her
aunt
Glegg
?
It
*NL*
did
not
become
a
girl
like
her
to
refuse
it
.
Or
else
,
why
did
she
not
*NL*
go
out
of
the
neighborhood
,
and
get
a
situation
where
she
was
not
*NL*
known
?
-LRB-
It
was
not
,
apparently
,
of
so
much
importance
that
she
should
*NL*
carry
her
dangerous
tendencies
into
strange
families
unknown
at
St.
*NL*
Ogg
's
.
-RRB-
She
must
be
very
bold
and
hardened
to
wish
to
stay
in
a
parish
*NL*
where
she
was
so
much
stared
at
and
whispered
about
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dr.
Kenn
,
having
great
natural
firmness
,
began
,
in
the
presence
of
*NL*
this
opposition
,
as
every
firm
man
would
have
done
,
to
contract
a
*NL*
certain
strength
of
determination
over
and
above
what
would
have
been
*NL*
called
forth
by
the
end
in
view
.
He
himself
wanted
a
daily
governess
*NL*
for
his
younger
children
;
and
though
he
had
hesitated
in
the
first
*NL*
instance
to
offer
this
position
to
Maggie
,
the
resolution
to
protest
*NL*
with
the
utmost
force
of
his
personal
and
priestly
character
against
*NL*
her
being
crushed
and
driven
away
by
slander
,
was
now
decisive
.
Maggie
*NL*
gratefully
accepted
an
employment
that
gave
her
duties
as
well
as
a
*NL*
support
;
her
days
would
be
filled
now
,
and
solitary
evenings
would
be
*NL*
a
welcome
rest
.
She
no
longer
needed
the
sacrifice
her
mother
made
in
*NL*
staying
with
her
,
and
Mrs.
Tulliver
was
persuaded
to
go
back
to
the
*NL*
Mill
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
now
it
began
to
be
discovered
that
Dr.
Kenn
,
exemplary
as
he
had
*NL*
hitherto
appeared
,
had
his
crotchets
,
possibly
his
weaknesses
.
The
*NL*
masculine
mind
of
St.
Ogg
's
smiled
pleasantly
,
and
did
not
wonder
that
*NL*
Kenn
liked
to
see
a
fine
pair
of
eyes
daily
,
or
that
he
was
inclined
*NL*
to
take
so
lenient
a
view
of
the
past
;
the
feminine
mind
,
regarded
at
*NL*
that
period
as
less
powerful
,
took
a
more
melancholy
view
of
the
case
.
*NL*
If
Dr.
Kenn
should
be
beguiled
into
marrying
that
Miss
Tulliver
!
It
*NL*
was
not
safe
to
be
too
confident
,
even
about
the
best
of
men
;
an
*NL*
apostle
had
fallen
,
and
wept
bitterly
afterwards
;
and
though
Peter
's
*NL*
denial
was
not
a
close
precedent
,
his
repentance
was
likely
to
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
had
not
taken
her
daily
walks
to
the
Rectory
for
many
weeks
,
*NL*
before
the
dreadful
possibility
of
her
some
time
or
other
becoming
the
*NL*
Rector
's
wife
had
been
talked
of
so
often
in
confidence
,
that
ladies
*NL*
were
beginning
to
discuss
how
they
should
behave
to
her
in
that
*NL*
position
.
For
Dr.
Kenn
,
it
had
been
understood
,
had
sat
in
the
*NL*
schoolroom
half
an
hour
one
morning
,
when
Miss
Tulliver
was
giving
her
*NL*
lessons
,
--
nay
,
he
had
sat
there
every
morning
;
he
had
once
walked
home
*NL*
with
her
,
--
he
almost
_
always
_
walked
home
with
her
,
--
and
if
not
,
he
*NL*
went
to
see
her
in
the
evening
.
What
an
artful
creature
she
was
!
What
*NL*
a
_
mother
_
for
those
children
!
It
was
enough
to
make
poor
Mrs.
Kenn
*NL*
turn
in
her
grave
,
that
they
should
be
put
under
the
care
of
this
girl
*NL*
only
a
few
weeks
after
her
death
.
Would
he
be
so
lost
to
propriety
as
*NL*
to
marry
her
before
the
year
was
out
?
The
masculine
mind
was
*NL*
sarcastic
,
and
thought
_
not
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Miss
Guests
saw
an
alleviation
to
the
sorrow
of
witnessing
a
folly
*NL*
in
their
Rector
;
at
least
their
brother
would
be
safe
;
and
their
*NL*
knowledge
of
Stephen
's
tenacity
was
a
constant
ground
of
alarm
to
*NL*
them
,
lest
he
should
come
back
and
marry
Maggie
.
They
were
not
among
*NL*
those
who
disbelieved
their
brother
's
letter
;
but
they
had
no
*NL*
confidence
in
Maggie
's
adherence
to
her
renunciation
of
him
;
they
*NL*
suspected
that
she
had
shrunk
rather
from
the
elopement
than
from
the
*NL*
marriage
,
and
that
she
lingered
in
St.
Ogg
's
,
relying
on
his
return
to
*NL*
her
.
They
had
always
thought
her
disagreeable
;
they
now
thought
her
*NL*
artful
and
proud
;
having
quite
as
good
grounds
for
that
judgment
as
*NL*
you
and
I
probably
have
for
many
strong
opinions
of
the
same
kind
.
*NL*
Formerly
they
had
not
altogether
delighted
in
the
contemplated
match
*NL*
with
Lucy
,
but
now
their
dread
of
a
marriage
between
Stephen
and
*NL*
Maggie
added
its
momentum
to
their
genuine
pity
and
indignation
on
*NL*
behalf
of
the
gentle
forsaken
girl
,
in
making
them
desire
that
he
*NL*
should
return
to
her
.
As
soon
as
Lucy
was
able
to
leave
home
,
she
was
*NL*
to
seek
relief
from
the
oppressive
heat
of
this
August
by
going
to
the
*NL*
coast
with
the
Miss
Guests
;
and
it
was
in
their
plans
that
Stephen
*NL*
should
be
induced
to
join
them
.
On
the
very
first
hint
of
gossip
*NL*
concerning
Maggie
and
Dr.
Kenn
,
the
report
was
conveyed
in
Miss
*NL*
Guest
's
letter
to
her
brother
.
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
had
frequent
tidings
through
her
mother
,
or
aunt
Glegg
,
or
Dr.
*NL*
Kenn
,
of
Lucy
's
gradual
progress
toward
recovery
,
and
her
thoughts
*NL*
tended
continually
toward
her
uncle
Deane
's
house
;
she
hungered
for
an
*NL*
interview
with
Lucy
,
if
it
were
only
for
five
minutes
,
to
utter
a
word
*NL*
of
penitence
,
to
be
assured
by
Lucy
's
own
eyes
and
lips
that
she
did
*NL*
not
believe
in
the
willing
treachery
of
those
whom
she
had
loved
and
*NL*
trusted
.
But
she
knew
that
even
if
her
uncle
's
indignation
had
not
*NL*
closed
his
house
against
her
,
the
agitation
of
such
an
interview
would
*NL*
have
been
forbidden
to
Lucy
.
Only
to
have
seen
her
without
speaking
*NL*
would
have
been
some
relief
;
for
Maggie
was
haunted
by
a
face
cruel
in
*NL*
its
very
gentleness
;
a
face
that
had
been
turned
on
hers
with
glad
,
*NL*
sweet
looks
of
trust
and
love
from
the
twilight
time
of
memory
;
*NL*
changed
now
to
a
sad
and
weary
face
by
a
first
heart-stroke
.
And
as
*NL*
the
days
passed
on
,
that
pale
image
became
more
and
more
distinct
;
the
*NL*
picture
grew
and
grew
into
more
speaking
definiteness
under
the
*NL*
avenging
hand
of
remorse
;
the
soft
hazel
eyes
,
in
their
look
of
pain
,
*NL*
were
bent
forever
on
Maggie
,
and
pierced
her
the
more
because
she
*NL*
could
see
no
anger
in
them
.
But
Lucy
was
not
yet
able
to
go
to
church
,
*NL*
or
any
place
where
Maggie
could
see
her
;
and
even
the
hope
of
that
*NL*
departed
,
when
the
news
was
told
her
by
aunt
Glegg
,
that
Lucy
was
*NL*
really
going
away
in
a
few
days
to
Scarborough
with
the
Miss
Guests
,
*NL*
who
had
been
heard
to
say
that
they
expected
their
brother
to
meet
*NL*
them
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
Only
those
who
have
known
what
hardest
inward
conflict
is
,
can
know
*NL*
what
Maggie
felt
as
she
sat
in
her
loneliness
the
evening
after
*NL*
hearing
that
news
from
Mrs.
Glegg
,
--
only
those
who
have
known
what
it
*NL*
is
to
dread
their
own
selfish
desires
as
the
watching
mother
would
*NL*
dread
the
sleeping-potion
that
was
to
still
her
own
pain
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
sat
without
candle
in
the
twilight
,
with
the
window
wide
open
*NL*
toward
the
river
;
the
sense
of
oppressive
heat
adding
itself
*NL*
undistinguishably
to
the
burthen
of
her
lot
.
Seated
on
a
chair
against
*NL*
the
window
,
with
her
arm
on
the
windowsill
she
was
looking
blankly
at
*NL*
the
flowing
river
,
swift
with
the
backward-rushing
tide
,
struggling
to
*NL*
see
still
the
sweet
face
in
its
unreproaching
sadness
,
that
seemed
now
*NL*
from
moment
to
moment
to
sink
away
and
be
hidden
behind
a
form
that
*NL*
thrust
itself
between
,
and
made
darkness
.
Hearing
the
door
open
,
she
*NL*
thought
Mrs.
Jakin
was
coming
in
with
her
supper
,
as
usual
;
and
with
*NL*
that
repugnance
to
trivial
speech
which
comes
with
languor
and
*NL*
wretchedness
,
she
shrank
from
turning
round
and
saying
she
wanted
*NL*
nothing
;
good
little
Mrs.
Jakin
would
be
sure
to
make
some
well-meant
*NL*
remarks
.
But
the
next
moment
,
without
her
having
discerned
the
sound
*NL*
of
a
footstep
,
she
felt
a
light
hand
on
her
shoulder
,
and
heard
a
*NL*
voice
close
to
her
saying
,
``
Maggie
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
face
was
there
,
--
changed
,
but
all
the
sweeter
;
the
hazel
eyes
were
*NL*
there
,
with
their
heart-piercing
tenderness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Maggie
!
''
the
soft
voice
said
.
``
Lucy
!
''
answered
a
voice
with
a
sharp
*NL*
ring
of
anguish
in
it
;
and
Lucy
threw
her
arms
round
Maggie
's
neck
,
*NL*
and
leaned
her
pale
cheek
against
the
burning
brow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
stole
out
,
''
said
Lucy
,
almost
in
a
whisper
,
while
she
sat
down
*NL*
close
to
Maggie
and
held
her
hand
,
``
when
papa
and
the
rest
were
away
.
*NL*
Alice
is
come
with
me
.
I
asked
her
to
help
me
.
But
I
must
only
stay
a
*NL*
little
while
,
because
it
is
so
late
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
easier
to
say
that
at
first
than
to
say
anything
else
.
They
sat
*NL*
looking
at
each
other
.
It
seemed
as
if
the
interview
must
end
without
*NL*
more
speech
,
for
speech
was
very
difficult
.
Each
felt
that
there
would
*NL*
be
something
scorching
in
the
words
that
would
recall
the
*NL*
irretrievable
wrong
.
But
soon
,
as
Maggie
looked
,
every
distinct
*NL*
thought
began
to
be
overflowed
by
a
wave
of
loving
penitence
,
and
*NL*
words
burst
forth
with
a
sob
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
bless
you
for
coming
,
Lucy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
sobs
came
thick
on
each
other
after
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Maggie
,
dear
,
be
comforted
,
''
said
Lucy
now
,
putting
her
cheek
against
*NL*
Maggie
's
again
.
``
Do
n't
grieve
.
''
And
she
sat
still
,
hoping
to
soothe
*NL*
Maggie
with
that
gentle
caress
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
mean
to
deceive
you
,
Lucy
,
''
said
Maggie
,
as
soon
as
she
*NL*
could
speak
.
``
It
always
made
me
wretched
that
I
felt
what
I
did
n't
*NL*
like
you
to
know
.
It
was
because
I
thought
it
would
all
be
conquered
,
*NL*
and
you
might
never
see
anything
to
wound
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
,
dear
,
''
said
Lucy
.
``
I
know
you
never
meant
to
make
me
unhappy
.
*NL*
It
is
a
trouble
that
has
come
on
us
all
;
you
have
more
to
bear
than
I
*NL*
have
--
and
you
gave
him
up
,
when
--
you
did
what
it
must
have
been
very
*NL*
hard
to
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
silent
again
a
little
while
,
sitting
with
clasped
hands
,
and
*NL*
cheeks
leaned
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lucy
,
''
Maggie
began
again
,
''
_
he
_
struggled
too
.
He
wanted
to
be
true
*NL*
to
you
.
He
will
come
back
to
you
.
Forgive
him
--
he
will
be
happy
*NL*
then
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
These
words
were
wrung
forth
from
Maggie
's
deepest
soul
,
with
an
*NL*
effort
like
the
convulsed
clutch
of
a
drowning
man
.
Lucy
trembled
and
*NL*
was
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
gentle
knock
came
at
the
door
.
It
was
Alice
,
the
maid
,
who
entered
*NL*
and
said
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
dare
n't
stay
any
longer
,
Miss
Deane
.
They
'll
find
it
out
,
and
*NL*
there
'll
be
such
anger
at
your
coming
out
so
late
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
rose
and
said
,
``
Very
well
,
Alice
,
--
in
a
minute
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
to
go
away
on
Friday
,
Maggie
,
''
she
added
,
when
Alice
had
closed
*NL*
the
door
again
.
``
When
I
come
back
,
and
am
strong
,
they
will
let
me
do
*NL*
as
I
like
.
I
shall
come
to
you
when
I
please
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lucy
,
''
said
Maggie
,
with
another
great
effort
,
``
I
pray
to
God
*NL*
continually
that
I
may
never
be
the
cause
of
sorrow
to
you
any
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
pressed
the
little
hand
that
she
held
between
hers
,
and
looked
up
*NL*
into
the
face
that
was
bent
over
hers
.
Lucy
never
forgot
that
look
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Maggie
,
''
she
said
,
in
a
low
voice
,
that
had
the
solemnity
of
*NL*
confession
in
it
,
``
you
are
better
than
I
am
.
I
ca
n't
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
broke
off
there
,
and
said
no
more
.
But
they
clasped
each
other
*NL*
again
in
a
last
embrace
.

Chapter
V
*NL*
*NL*
The
Last
Conflict
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
second
week
of
September
,
Maggie
was
again
sitting
in
her
*NL*
lonely
room
,
battling
with
the
old
shadowy
enemies
that
were
forever
*NL*
slain
and
rising
again
.
It
was
past
midnight
,
and
the
rain
was
beating
*NL*
heavily
against
the
window
,
driven
with
fitful
force
by
the
rushing
,
*NL*
loud-moaning
wind
.
For
the
day
after
Lucy
's
visit
there
had
been
a
*NL*
sudden
change
in
the
weather
;
the
heat
and
drought
had
given
way
to
*NL*
cold
variable
winds
,
and
heavy
falls
of
rain
at
intervals
;
and
she
had
*NL*
been
forbidden
to
risk
the
contemplated
journey
until
the
weather
*NL*
should
become
more
settled
.
In
the
counties
higher
up
the
Floss
the
*NL*
rains
had
been
continuous
,
and
the
completion
of
the
harvest
had
been
*NL*
arrested
.
And
now
,
for
the
last
two
days
,
the
rains
on
this
lower
*NL*
course
of
the
river
had
been
incessant
,
so
that
the
old
men
had
shaken
*NL*
their
heads
and
talked
of
sixty
years
ago
,
when
the
same
sort
of
*NL*
weather
,
happening
about
the
equinox
,
brought
on
the
great
floods
,
*NL*
which
swept
the
bridge
away
,
and
reduced
the
town
to
great
misery
.
But
*NL*
the
younger
generation
,
who
had
seen
several
small
floods
,
thought
*NL*
lightly
of
these
sombre
recollections
and
forebodings
;
and
Bob
Jakin
,
*NL*
naturally
prone
to
take
a
hopeful
view
of
his
own
luck
,
laughed
at
his
*NL*
mother
when
she
regretted
their
having
taken
a
house
by
the
riverside
,
*NL*
observing
that
but
for
that
they
would
have
had
no
boats
,
which
were
*NL*
the
most
lucky
of
possessions
in
case
of
a
flood
that
obliged
them
to
*NL*
go
to
a
distance
for
food
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
careless
and
the
fearful
were
alike
sleeping
in
their
beds
*NL*
now
.
There
was
hope
that
the
rain
would
abate
by
the
morrow
;
*NL*
threatenings
of
a
worse
kind
,
from
sudden
thaws
after
falls
of
snow
,
*NL*
had
often
passed
off
,
in
the
experience
of
the
younger
ones
;
and
at
*NL*
the
very
worst
,
the
banks
would
be
sure
to
break
lower
down
the
river
*NL*
when
the
tide
came
in
with
violence
,
and
so
the
waters
would
be
*NL*
carried
off
,
without
causing
more
than
temporary
inconvenience
,
and
*NL*
losses
that
would
be
felt
only
by
the
poorer
sort
,
whom
charity
would
*NL*
relieve
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
were
in
their
beds
now
,
for
it
was
past
midnight
;
all
except
some
*NL*
solitary
watchers
such
as
Maggie
.
She
was
seated
in
her
little
parlor
*NL*
toward
the
river
,
with
one
candle
,
that
left
everything
dim
in
the
*NL*
room
except
a
letter
which
lay
before
her
on
the
table
.
That
letter
,
*NL*
which
had
come
to
her
to-day
,
was
one
of
the
causes
that
had
kept
her
*NL*
up
far
on
into
the
night
,
unconscious
how
the
hours
were
going
,
*NL*
careless
of
seeking
rest
,
with
no
image
of
rest
coming
across
her
*NL*
mind
,
except
of
that
far
,
far
off
rest
from
which
there
would
be
no
*NL*
more
waking
for
her
into
this
struggling
earthly
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
days
before
Maggie
received
that
letter
,
she
had
been
to
the
*NL*
Rectory
for
the
last
time
.
The
heavy
rain
would
have
prevented
her
*NL*
from
going
since
;
but
there
was
another
reason
.
Dr.
Kenn
,
at
first
*NL*
enlightened
only
by
a
few
hints
as
to
the
new
turn
which
gossip
and
*NL*
slander
had
taken
in
relation
to
Maggie
,
had
recently
been
made
more
*NL*
fully
aware
of
it
by
an
earnest
remonstrance
from
one
of
his
male
*NL*
parishioners
against
the
indiscretion
of
persisting
in
the
attempt
to
*NL*
overcome
the
prevalent
feeling
in
the
parish
by
a
course
of
*NL*
resistance
.
Dr.
Kenn
,
having
a
conscience
void
of
offence
in
the
*NL*
matter
,
was
still
inclined
to
persevere
,
--
was
still
averse
to
give
way
*NL*
before
a
public
sentiment
that
was
odious
and
contemptible
;
but
he
was
*NL*
finally
wrought
upon
by
the
consideration
of
the
peculiar
*NL*
responsibility
attached
to
his
office
,
of
avoiding
the
appearance
of
*NL*
evil
,
--
an
``
appearance
''
that
is
always
dependent
on
the
average
quality
*NL*
of
surrounding
minds
.
Where
these
minds
are
low
and
gross
,
the
area
of
*NL*
that
``
appearance
''
is
proportionately
widened
.
Perhaps
he
was
in
danger
*NL*
of
acting
from
obstinacy
;
perhaps
it
was
his
duty
to
succumb
.
*NL*
Conscientious
people
are
apt
to
see
their
duty
in
that
which
is
the
*NL*
most
painful
course
;
and
to
recede
was
always
painful
to
Dr.
Kenn
.
He
*NL*
made
up
his
mind
that
he
must
advise
Maggie
to
go
away
from
St.
Ogg
's
*NL*
for
a
time
;
and
he
performed
that
difficult
task
with
as
much
delicacy
*NL*
as
he
could
,
only
stating
in
vague
terms
that
he
found
his
attempt
to
*NL*
countenance
her
stay
was
a
source
of
discord
between
himself
and
his
*NL*
parishioners
,
that
was
likely
to
obstruct
his
usefulness
as
a
*NL*
clergyman
.
He
begged
her
to
allow
him
to
write
to
a
clerical
friend
of
*NL*
his
,
who
might
possibly
take
her
into
his
own
family
as
governess
;
*NL*
and
,
if
not
,
would
probably
know
of
some
other
available
position
for
*NL*
a
young
woman
in
whose
welfare
Dr.
Kenn
felt
a
strong
interest
.
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Maggie
listened
with
a
trembling
lip
;
she
could
say
nothing
but
a
*NL*
faint
``
Thank
you
,
I
shall
be
grateful
''
;
and
she
walked
back
to
her
*NL*
lodgings
,
through
the
driving
rain
,
with
a
new
sense
of
desolation
.
*NL*
She
must
be
a
lonely
wanderer
;
she
must
go
out
among
fresh
faces
,
that
*NL*
would
look
at
her
wonderingly
,
because
the
days
did
not
seem
joyful
to
*NL*
her
;
she
must
begin
a
new
life
,
in
which
she
would
have
to
rouse
*NL*
herself
to
receive
new
impressions
;
and
she
was
so
unspeakably
,
*NL*
sickeningly
weary
!
There
was
no
home
,
no
help
for
the
erring
;
even
*NL*
those
who
pitied
were
constrained
to
hardness
.
But
ought
she
to
*NL*
complain
?
Ought
she
to
shrink
in
this
way
from
the
long
penance
of
*NL*
life
,
which
was
all
the
possibility
she
had
of
lightening
the
load
to
*NL*
some
other
sufferers
,
and
so
changing
that
passionate
error
into
a
new
*NL*
force
of
unselfish
human
love
?
All
the
next
day
she
sat
in
her
lonely
*NL*
room
,
with
a
window
darkened
by
the
cloud
and
the
driving
rain
,
*NL*
thinking
of
that
future
,
and
wrestling
for
patience
;
for
what
repose
*NL*
could
poor
Maggie
ever
win
except
by
wrestling
?
*NL*
*NL*
And
on
the
third
day
--
this
day
of
which
she
had
just
sat
out
the
*NL*
close
--
the
letter
had
come
which
was
lying
on
the
table
before
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
letter
was
from
Stephen
.
He
was
come
back
from
Holland
;
he
was
at
*NL*
Mudport
again
,
unknown
to
any
of
his
friends
,
and
had
written
to
her
*NL*
from
that
place
,
enclosing
the
letter
to
a
person
whom
he
trusted
in
*NL*
St.
Ogg
's
.
From
beginning
to
end
it
was
a
passionate
cry
of
reproach
;
*NL*
an
appeal
against
her
useless
sacrifice
of
him
,
of
herself
,
against
*NL*
that
perverted
notion
of
right
which
led
her
to
crush
all
his
hopes
,
*NL*
for
the
sake
of
a
mere
idea
,
and
not
any
substantial
good
,
--
_
his
_
*NL*
hopes
,
whom
she
loved
,
and
who
loved
her
with
that
single
overpowering
*NL*
passion
,
that
worship
,
which
a
man
never
gives
to
a
woman
more
than
*NL*
once
in
his
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
have
written
to
me
that
you
are
to
marry
Kenn
.
As
if
I
should
*NL*
believe
that
!
Perhaps
they
have
told
you
some
such
fables
about
me
.
*NL*
Perhaps
they
tell
you
I
've
been
`
travelling
.
'
My
body
has
been
dragged
*NL*
about
somewhere
;
but
_
I
_
have
never
travelled
from
the
hideous
place
*NL*
where
you
left
me
;
where
I
started
up
from
the
stupor
of
helpless
rage
*NL*
to
find
you
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Maggie
!
whose
pain
can
have
been
like
mine
?
Whose
injury
is
like
*NL*
mine
?
Who
besides
me
has
met
that
long
look
of
love
that
has
burnt
*NL*
itself
into
my
soul
,
so
that
no
other
image
can
come
there
?
Maggie
,
*NL*
call
me
back
to
you
!
Call
me
back
to
life
and
goodness
!
I
am
banished
*NL*
from
both
now
.
I
have
no
motives
;
I
am
indifferent
to
everything
.
Two
*NL*
months
have
only
deepened
the
certainty
that
I
can
never
care
for
life
*NL*
without
you
.
Write
me
one
word
;
say
`
Come
!
'
In
two
days
I
should
be
*NL*
with
you
.
Maggie
,
have
you
forgotten
what
it
was
to
be
together
,
--
to
*NL*
be
within
reach
of
a
look
,
to
be
within
hearing
of
each
other
's
*NL*
voice
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
Maggie
first
read
this
letter
she
felt
as
if
her
real
temptation
*NL*
had
only
just
begun
.
At
the
entrance
of
the
chill
dark
cavern
,
we
turn
*NL*
with
unworn
courage
from
the
warm
light
;
but
how
,
when
we
have
trodden
*NL*
far
in
the
damp
darkness
,
and
have
begun
to
be
faint
and
weary
;
how
,
*NL*
if
there
is
a
sudden
opening
above
us
,
and
we
are
invited
back
again
*NL*
to
the
life-nourishing
day
?
The
leap
of
natural
longing
from
under
the
*NL*
pressure
of
pain
is
so
strong
,
that
all
less
immediate
motives
are
*NL*
likely
to
be
forgotten
--
till
the
pain
has
been
escaped
from
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
hours
Maggie
felt
as
if
her
struggle
had
been
in
vain
.
For
hours
*NL*
every
other
thought
that
she
strove
to
summon
was
thrust
aside
by
the
*NL*
image
of
Stephen
waiting
for
the
single
word
that
would
bring
him
to
*NL*
her
.
She
did
not
_
read
_
the
letter
:
she
heard
him
uttering
it
,
and
the
*NL*
voice
shook
her
with
its
old
strange
power
.
All
the
day
before
she
had
*NL*
been
filled
with
the
vision
of
a
lonely
future
through
which
she
must
*NL*
carry
the
burthen
of
regret
,
upheld
only
by
clinging
faith
.
And
here
,
*NL*
close
within
her
reach
,
urging
itself
upon
her
even
as
a
claim
,
was
*NL*
another
future
,
in
which
hard
endurance
and
effort
were
to
be
*NL*
exchanged
for
easy
,
delicious
leaning
on
another
's
loving
strength
!
*NL*
And
yet
that
promise
of
joy
in
the
place
of
sadness
did
not
make
the
*NL*
dire
force
of
the
temptation
to
Maggie
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
Stephen
's
tone
of
misery
,
it
was
the
doubt
in
the
justice
of
*NL*
her
own
resolve
,
that
made
the
balance
tremble
,
and
made
her
once
*NL*
start
from
her
seat
to
reach
the
pen
and
paper
,
and
write
``
Come
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
close
upon
that
decisive
act
,
her
mind
recoiled
;
and
the
sense
of
*NL*
contradiction
with
her
past
self
in
her
moments
of
strength
and
*NL*
clearness
came
upon
her
like
a
pang
of
conscious
degradation
.
No
,
she
*NL*
must
wait
;
she
must
pray
;
the
light
that
had
forsaken
her
would
come
*NL*
again
;
she
should
feel
again
what
she
had
felt
when
she
had
fled
away
,
*NL*
under
an
inspiration
strong
enough
to
conquer
agony
,
--
to
conquer
love
;
*NL*
she
should
feel
again
what
she
had
felt
when
Lucy
stood
by
her
,
when
*NL*
Philip
's
letter
had
stirred
all
the
fibres
that
bound
her
to
the
*NL*
calmer
past
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
sat
quite
still
,
far
on
into
the
night
,
with
no
impulse
to
change
*NL*
her
attitude
,
without
active
force
enough
even
for
the
mental
act
of
*NL*
prayer
;
only
waiting
for
the
light
that
would
surely
come
again
.
It
*NL*
came
with
the
memories
that
no
passion
could
long
quench
;
the
long
*NL*
past
came
back
to
her
,
and
with
it
the
fountains
of
self-renouncing
*NL*
pity
and
affection
,
of
faithfulness
and
resolve
.
The
words
that
were
*NL*
marked
by
the
quiet
hand
in
the
little
old
book
that
she
had
long
ago
*NL*
learned
by
heart
,
rushed
even
to
her
lips
,
and
found
a
vent
for
*NL*
themselves
in
a
low
murmur
that
was
quite
lost
in
the
loud
driving
of
*NL*
the
rain
against
the
window
and
the
loud
moan
and
roar
of
the
wind
.
``
I
*NL*
have
received
the
Cross
,
I
have
received
it
from
Thy
hand
;
I
will
bear
*NL*
it
,
and
bear
it
till
death
,
as
Thou
hast
laid
it
upon
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
soon
other
words
rose
that
could
find
no
utterance
but
in
a
*NL*
sob
,
--
``
Forgive
me
,
Stephen
!
It
will
pass
away
.
You
will
come
back
to
*NL*
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
took
up
the
letter
,
held
it
to
the
candle
,
and
let
it
burn
slowly
*NL*
on
the
hearth
.
To-morrow
she
would
write
to
him
the
last
word
of
*NL*
parting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
bear
it
,
and
bear
it
till
death
.
But
how
long
it
will
be
*NL*
before
death
comes
!
I
am
so
young
,
so
healthy
.
How
shall
I
have
*NL*
patience
and
strength
?
Am
I
to
struggle
and
fall
and
repent
again
?
Has
*NL*
life
other
trials
as
hard
for
me
still
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
that
cry
of
self-despair
,
Maggie
fell
on
her
knees
against
the
*NL*
table
,
and
buried
her
sorrow-stricken
face
.
Her
soul
went
out
to
the
*NL*
Unseen
Pity
that
would
be
with
her
to
the
end
.
Surely
there
was
*NL*
something
being
taught
her
by
this
experience
of
great
need
;
and
she
*NL*
must
be
learning
a
secret
of
human
tenderness
and
long-suffering
,
that
*NL*
the
less
erring
could
hardly
know
?
``
O
God
,
if
my
life
is
to
be
long
,
*NL*
let
me
live
to
bless
and
comfort
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
Maggie
felt
a
startling
sensation
of
sudden
cold
about
*NL*
her
knees
and
feet
;
it
was
water
flowing
under
her
.
She
started
up
;
*NL*
the
stream
was
flowing
under
the
door
that
led
into
the
passage
.
She
*NL*
was
not
bewildered
for
an
instant
;
she
knew
it
was
the
flood
!
*NL*
*NL*
The
tumult
of
emotion
she
had
been
enduring
for
the
last
twelve
hours
*NL*
seemed
to
have
left
a
great
calm
in
her
;
without
screaming
,
she
*NL*
hurried
with
the
candle
upstairs
to
Bob
Jakin
's
bedroom
.
The
door
was
*NL*
ajar
;
she
went
in
and
shook
him
by
the
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bob
,
the
flood
is
come
!
it
is
in
the
house
;
let
us
see
if
we
can
make
*NL*
the
boats
safe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
lighted
his
candle
,
while
the
poor
wife
,
snatching
up
her
baby
,
*NL*
burst
into
screams
;
and
then
she
hurried
down
again
to
see
if
the
*NL*
waters
were
rising
fast
.
There
was
a
step
down
into
the
room
at
the
*NL*
door
leading
from
the
staircase
;
she
saw
that
the
water
was
already
on
*NL*
a
level
with
the
step
.
While
she
was
looking
,
something
came
with
a
*NL*
tremendous
crash
against
the
window
,
and
sent
the
leaded
panes
and
the
*NL*
old
wooden
framework
inward
in
shivers
,
the
water
pouring
in
after
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
the
boat
!
''
cried
Maggie
.
``
Bob
,
come
down
to
get
the
boats
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
without
a
moment
's
shudder
of
fear
,
she
plunged
through
the
water
,
*NL*
which
was
rising
fast
to
her
knees
,
and
by
the
glimmering
light
of
the
*NL*
candle
she
had
left
on
the
stairs
,
she
mounted
on
to
the
window-sill
,
*NL*
and
crept
into
the
boat
,
which
was
left
with
the
prow
lodging
and
*NL*
protruding
through
the
window
.
Bob
was
not
long
after
her
,
hurrying
*NL*
without
shoes
or
stockings
,
but
with
the
lanthorn
in
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
they
're
both
here
,
--
both
the
boats
,
''
said
Bob
,
as
he
got
into
*NL*
the
one
where
Maggie
was
.
``
It
's
wonderful
this
fastening
is
n't
broke
*NL*
too
,
as
well
as
the
mooring
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
excitement
of
getting
into
the
other
boat
,
unfastening
it
,
and
*NL*
mastering
an
oar
,
Bob
was
not
struck
with
the
danger
Maggie
incurred
.
*NL*
We
are
not
apt
to
fear
for
the
fearless
,
when
we
are
companions
in
*NL*
their
danger
,
and
Bob
's
mind
was
absorbed
in
possible
expedients
for
*NL*
the
safety
of
the
helpless
indoors
.
The
fact
that
Maggie
had
been
up
,
*NL*
had
waked
him
,
and
had
taken
the
lead
in
activity
,
gave
Bob
a
vague
*NL*
impression
of
her
as
one
who
would
help
to
protect
,
not
need
to
be
*NL*
protected
.
She
too
had
got
possession
of
an
oar
,
and
had
pushed
off
,
*NL*
so
as
to
release
the
boat
from
the
overhanging
window-frame
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
water
's
rising
so
fast
,
''
said
Bob
,
``
I
doubt
it
'll
be
in
at
the
*NL*
chambers
before
long
,
--
th
'
house
is
so
low
.
I
've
more
mind
to
get
*NL*
Prissy
and
the
child
and
the
mother
into
the
boat
,
if
I
could
,
and
*NL*
trusten
to
the
water
,
--
for
th
'
old
house
is
none
so
safe
.
And
if
I
let
*NL*
go
the
boat
--
but
_
you
_
,
''
he
exclaimed
,
suddenly
lifting
the
light
of
*NL*
his
lanthorn
on
Maggie
,
as
she
stood
in
the
rain
with
the
oar
in
her
*NL*
hand
and
her
black
hair
streaming
.
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
had
no
time
to
answer
,
for
a
new
tidal
current
swept
along
the
*NL*
line
of
the
houses
,
and
drove
both
the
boats
out
on
to
the
wide
water
,
*NL*
with
a
force
that
carried
them
far
past
the
meeting
current
of
the
*NL*
river
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
first
moments
Maggie
felt
nothing
,
thought
of
nothing
,
but
that
*NL*
she
had
suddenly
passed
away
from
that
life
which
she
had
been
*NL*
dreading
;
it
was
the
transition
of
death
,
without
its
agony
,
--
and
she
*NL*
was
alone
in
the
darkness
with
God
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
whole
thing
had
been
so
rapid
,
so
dreamlike
,
that
the
threads
of
*NL*
ordinary
association
were
broken
;
she
sank
down
on
the
seat
clutching
*NL*
the
oar
mechanically
,
and
for
a
long
while
had
no
distinct
conception
*NL*
of
her
position
.
The
first
thing
that
waked
her
to
fuller
*NL*
consciousness
was
the
cessation
of
the
rain
,
and
a
perception
that
the
*NL*
darkness
was
divided
by
the
faintest
light
,
which
parted
the
*NL*
overhanging
gloom
from
the
immeasurable
watery
level
below
.
She
was
*NL*
driven
out
upon
the
flood
,
--
that
awful
visitation
of
God
which
her
*NL*
father
used
to
talk
of
;
which
had
made
the
nightmare
of
her
childish
*NL*
dreams
.
And
with
that
thought
there
rushed
in
the
vision
of
the
old
*NL*
home
,
and
Tom
,
and
her
mother
,
--
they
had
all
listened
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
God
,
where
am
I
?
Which
is
the
way
home
?
''
she
cried
out
,
in
the
dim
*NL*
loneliness
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
was
happening
to
them
at
the
Mill
?
The
flood
had
once
nearly
*NL*
destroyed
it
.
They
might
be
in
danger
,
in
distress
,
--
her
mother
and
*NL*
her
brother
,
alone
there
,
beyond
reach
of
help
!
Her
whole
soul
was
*NL*
strained
now
on
that
thought
;
and
she
saw
the
long-loved
faces
looking
*NL*
for
help
into
the
darkness
,
and
finding
none
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
floating
in
smooth
water
now
,
--
perhaps
far
on
the
overflooded
*NL*
fields
.
There
was
no
sense
of
present
danger
to
check
the
outgoing
of
*NL*
her
mind
to
the
old
home
;
and
she
strained
her
eyes
against
the
*NL*
curtain
of
gloom
that
she
might
seize
the
first
sight
of
her
*NL*
whereabout
,
--
that
she
might
catch
some
faint
suggestion
of
the
spot
*NL*
toward
which
all
her
anxieties
tended
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oh
,
how
welcome
,
the
widening
of
that
dismal
watery
level
,
the
gradual
*NL*
uplifting
of
the
cloudy
firmament
,
the
slowly
defining
blackness
of
*NL*
objects
above
the
glassy
dark
!
Yes
,
she
must
be
out
on
the
fields
;
*NL*
those
were
the
tops
of
hedgerow
trees
.
Which
way
did
the
river
lie
?
*NL*
Looking
behind
her
,
she
saw
the
lines
of
black
trees
;
looking
before
*NL*
her
,
there
were
none
;
then
the
river
lay
before
her
.
She
seized
an
oar
*NL*
and
began
to
paddle
the
boat
forward
with
the
energy
of
wakening
hope
;
*NL*
the
dawning
seemed
to
advance
more
swiftly
,
now
she
was
in
action
;
and
*NL*
she
could
soon
see
the
poor
dumb
beasts
crowding
piteously
on
a
mound
*NL*
where
they
had
taken
refuge
.
Onward
she
paddled
and
rowed
by
turns
in
*NL*
the
growing
twilight
;
her
wet
clothes
clung
round
her
,
and
her
*NL*
streaming
hair
was
dashed
about
by
the
wind
,
but
she
was
hardly
*NL*
conscious
of
any
bodily
sensations
,
--
except
a
sensation
of
strength
,
*NL*
inspired
by
mighty
emotion
.
Along
with
the
sense
of
danger
and
*NL*
possible
rescue
for
those
long-remembered
beings
at
the
old
home
,
*NL*
there
was
an
undefined
sense
of
reconcilement
with
her
brother
;
what
*NL*
quarrel
,
what
harshness
,
what
unbelief
in
each
other
can
subsist
in
*NL*
the
presence
of
a
great
calamity
,
when
all
the
artificial
vesture
of
*NL*
our
life
is
gone
,
and
we
are
all
one
with
each
other
in
primitive
*NL*
mortal
needs
?
Vaguely
Maggie
felt
this
,
in
the
strong
resurgent
love
*NL*
toward
her
brother
that
swept
away
all
the
later
impressions
of
hard
,
*NL*
cruel
offence
and
misunderstanding
,
and
left
only
the
deep
,
*NL*
underlying
,
unshakable
memories
of
early
union
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
now
there
was
a
large
dark
mass
in
the
distance
,
and
near
to
her
*NL*
Maggie
could
discern
the
current
of
the
river
.
The
dark
mass
must
*NL*
be
--
yes
,
it
was
--
St.
Ogg
's
.
Ah
,
now
she
knew
which
way
to
look
for
the
*NL*
first
glimpse
of
the
well-known
trees
--
the
gray
willows
,
the
now
*NL*
yellowing
chestnuts
--
and
above
them
the
old
roof
!
But
there
was
no
*NL*
color
,
no
shape
yet
;
all
was
faint
and
dim
.
More
and
more
strongly
the
*NL*
energies
seemed
to
come
and
put
themselves
forth
,
as
if
her
life
were
*NL*
a
stored-up
force
that
was
being
spent
in
this
hour
,
unneeded
for
any
*NL*
future
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
must
get
her
boat
into
the
current
of
the
Floss
,
else
she
would
*NL*
never
be
able
to
pass
the
Ripple
and
approach
the
house
;
this
was
the
*NL*
thought
that
occurred
to
her
,
as
she
imagined
with
more
and
more
*NL*
vividness
the
state
of
things
round
the
old
home
.
But
then
she
might
*NL*
be
carried
very
far
down
,
and
be
unable
to
guide
her
boat
out
of
the
*NL*
current
again
.
For
the
first
time
distinct
ideas
of
danger
began
to
*NL*
press
upon
her
;
but
there
was
no
choice
of
courses
,
no
room
for
*NL*
hesitation
,
and
she
floated
into
the
current
.
Swiftly
she
went
now
*NL*
without
effort
;
more
and
more
clearly
in
the
lessening
distance
and
*NL*
the
growing
light
she
began
to
discern
the
objects
that
she
knew
must
*NL*
be
the
well-known
trees
and
roofs
;
nay
,
she
was
not
far
off
a
rushing
,
*NL*
muddy
current
that
must
be
the
strangely
altered
Ripple
.
*NL*
*NL*
Great
God
!
there
were
floating
masses
in
it
,
that
might
dash
against
*NL*
her
boat
as
she
passed
,
and
cause
her
to
perish
too
soon
.
What
were
*NL*
those
masses
?
*NL*
*NL*
For
the
first
time
Maggie
's
heart
began
to
beat
in
an
agony
of
dread
.
*NL*
She
sat
helpless
,
dimly
conscious
that
she
was
being
floated
along
,
*NL*
more
intensely
conscious
of
the
anticipated
clash
.
But
the
horror
was
*NL*
transient
;
it
passed
away
before
the
oncoming
warehouses
of
St.
Ogg
's
.
*NL*
She
had
passed
the
mouth
of
the
Ripple
,
then
;
_
now
_
,
she
must
use
all
*NL*
her
skill
and
power
to
manage
the
boat
and
get
it
if
possible
out
of
*NL*
the
current
.
She
could
see
now
that
the
bridge
was
broken
down
;
she
*NL*
could
see
the
masts
of
a
stranded
vessel
far
out
over
the
watery
*NL*
field
.
But
no
boats
were
to
be
seen
moving
on
the
river
,
--
such
as
had
*NL*
been
laid
hands
on
were
employed
in
the
flooded
streets
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
new
resolution
,
Maggie
seized
her
oar
,
and
stood
up
again
to
*NL*
paddle
;
but
the
now
ebbing
tide
added
to
the
swiftness
of
the
river
,
*NL*
and
she
was
carried
along
beyond
the
bridge
.
She
could
hear
shouts
*NL*
from
the
windows
overlooking
the
river
,
as
if
the
people
there
were
*NL*
calling
to
her
.
It
was
not
till
she
had
passed
on
nearly
to
Tofton
*NL*
that
she
could
get
the
boat
clear
of
the
current
.
Then
with
one
*NL*
yearning
look
toward
her
uncle
Deane
's
house
that
lay
farther
down
the
*NL*
river
,
she
took
to
both
her
oars
and
rowed
with
all
her
might
across
*NL*
the
watery
fields
,
back
toward
the
Mill
.
Color
was
beginning
to
awake
*NL*
now
,
and
as
she
approached
the
Dorlcote
fields
,
she
could
discern
the
*NL*
tints
of
the
trees
,
could
see
the
old
Scotch
firs
far
to
the
right
,
*NL*
and
the
home
chestnuts
,
--
oh
,
how
deep
they
lay
in
the
water
,
--
deeper
*NL*
than
the
trees
on
this
side
the
hill
!
And
the
roof
of
the
Mill
--
where
*NL*
was
it
?
Those
heavy
fragments
hurrying
down
the
Ripple
,
--
what
had
they
*NL*
meant
?
But
it
was
not
the
house
,
--
the
house
stood
firm
;
drowned
up
to
*NL*
the
first
story
,
but
still
firm
,
--
or
was
it
broken
in
at
the
end
*NL*
toward
the
Mill
?
*NL*
*NL*
With
panting
joy
that
she
was
there
at
last
,
--
joy
that
overcame
all
*NL*
distress
,
--
Maggie
neared
the
front
of
the
house
.
At
first
she
heard
no
*NL*
sound
;
she
saw
no
object
moving
.
Her
boat
was
on
a
level
with
the
*NL*
upstairs
window
.
She
called
out
in
a
loud
,
piercing
voice
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tom
,
where
are
you
?
Mother
,
where
are
you
?
Here
is
Maggie
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Soon
,
from
the
window
of
the
attic
in
the
central
gable
,
she
heard
*NL*
Tom
's
voice
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
it
?
Have
you
brought
a
boat
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
I
,
Tom
,
--
Maggie
.
Where
is
mother
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
not
here
;
she
went
to
Garum
the
day
before
yesterday
.
I
'll
*NL*
come
down
to
the
lower
window
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alone
,
Maggie
?
''
said
Tom
,
in
a
voice
of
deep
astonishment
,
as
he
*NL*
opened
the
middle
window
,
on
a
level
with
the
boat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Tom
;
God
has
taken
care
of
me
,
to
bring
me
to
you
.
Get
in
*NL*
quickly
.
Is
there
no
one
else
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Tom
,
stepping
into
the
boat
;
``
I
fear
the
man
is
drowned
;
he
*NL*
was
carried
down
the
Ripple
,
I
think
,
when
part
of
the
Mill
fell
with
*NL*
the
crash
of
trees
and
stones
against
it
;
I
've
shouted
again
and
*NL*
again
,
and
there
has
been
no
answer
.
Give
me
the
oars
,
Maggie
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
till
Tom
had
pushed
off
and
they
were
on
the
wide
*NL*
water
,
--
he
face
to
face
with
Maggie
,
--
that
the
full
meaning
of
what
*NL*
had
happened
rushed
upon
his
mind
.
It
came
with
so
overpowering
a
*NL*
force
,
--
it
was
such
a
new
revelation
to
his
spirit
,
of
the
depths
in
*NL*
life
that
had
lain
beyond
his
vision
,
which
he
had
fancied
so
keen
and
*NL*
clear
,
--
that
he
was
unable
to
ask
a
question
.
They
sat
mutely
gazing
*NL*
at
each
other
,
--
Maggie
with
eyes
of
intense
life
looking
out
from
a
*NL*
weary
,
beaten
face
;
Tom
pale
,
with
a
certain
awe
and
humiliation
.
*NL*
Thought
was
busy
though
the
lips
were
silent
;
and
though
he
could
ask
*NL*
no
question
,
he
guessed
a
story
of
almost
miraculous
,
divinely
*NL*
protected
effort
.
But
at
last
a
mist
gathered
over
the
blue-gray
eyes
,
*NL*
and
the
lips
found
a
word
they
could
utter
,
--
the
old
childish
*NL*
``
Magsie
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
could
make
no
answer
but
a
long
,
deep
sob
of
that
mysterious
,
*NL*
wondrous
happiness
that
is
one
with
pain
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
she
could
speak
,
she
said
,
``
We
will
go
to
Lucy
,
Tom
;
we
'll
*NL*
go
and
see
if
she
is
safe
,
and
then
we
can
help
the
rest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
rowed
with
untired
vigor
,
and
with
a
different
speed
from
poor
*NL*
Maggie
's
.
The
boat
was
soon
in
the
current
of
the
river
again
,
and
*NL*
soon
they
would
be
at
Tofton
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Park
House
stands
high
up
out
of
the
flood
,
''
said
Maggie
.
``
Perhaps
*NL*
they
have
got
Lucy
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
else
was
said
;
a
new
danger
was
being
carried
toward
them
by
*NL*
the
river
.
Some
wooden
machinery
had
just
given
way
on
one
of
the
*NL*
wharves
,
and
huge
fragments
were
being
floated
along
.
The
sun
was
*NL*
rising
now
,
and
the
wide
area
of
watery
desolation
was
spread
out
in
*NL*
dreadful
clearness
around
them
;
in
dreadful
clearness
floated
onward
*NL*
the
hurrying
,
threatening
masses
.
A
large
company
in
a
boat
that
was
*NL*
working
its
way
along
under
the
Tofton
houses
observed
their
danger
,
*NL*
and
shouted
,
``
Get
out
of
the
current
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
that
could
not
be
done
at
once
;
and
Tom
,
looking
before
him
,
saw
*NL*
death
rushing
on
them
.
Huge
fragments
,
clinging
together
in
fatal
*NL*
fellowship
,
made
one
wide
mass
across
the
stream
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
coming
,
Maggie
!
''
Tom
said
,
in
a
deep
,
hoarse
voice
,
loosing
the
*NL*
oars
,
and
clasping
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
instant
the
boat
was
no
longer
seen
upon
the
water
,
and
the
*NL*
huge
mass
was
hurrying
on
in
hideous
triumph
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
soon
the
keel
of
the
boat
reappeared
,
a
black
speck
on
the
golden
*NL*
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
boat
reappeared
,
but
brother
and
sister
had
gone
down
in
an
*NL*
embrace
never
to
be
parted
;
living
through
again
in
one
supreme
moment
*NL*
the
days
when
they
had
clasped
their
little
hands
in
love
,
and
roamed
*NL*
the
daisied
fields
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
Conclusion
*NL*
*NL*
Nature
repairs
her
ravages
,
--
repairs
them
with
her
sunshine
,
and
with
*NL*
human
labor
.
The
desolation
wrought
by
that
flood
had
left
little
*NL*
visible
trace
on
the
face
of
the
earth
,
five
years
after
.
The
fifth
*NL*
autumn
was
rich
in
golden
cornstacks
,
rising
in
thick
clusters
among
*NL*
the
distant
hedgerows
;
the
wharves
and
warehouses
on
the
Floss
were
*NL*
busy
again
,
with
echoes
of
eager
voices
,
with
hopeful
lading
and
*NL*
unlading
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
every
man
and
woman
mentioned
in
this
history
was
still
living
,
*NL*
except

*NL*
Nature
repairs
her
ravages
,
but
not
all
.
The
uptorn
trees
are
not
*NL*
rooted
again
;
the
parted
hills
are
left
scarred
;
if
there
is
a
new
*NL*
growth
,
the
trees
are
not
the
same
as
the
old
,
and
the
hills
*NL*
underneath
their
green
vesture
bear
the
marks
of
the
past
rending
.
To
*NL*
the
eyes
that
have
dwelt
on
the
past
,
there
is
no
thorough
repair

Dorlcote
Mill
was
rebuilt
.
And
Dorlcote
churchyard
--
where
the
brick
*NL*
grave
that
held
a
father
whom
we
know
,
was
found
with
the
stone
laid
*NL*
prostrate
upon
it
after
the
flood
--
had
recovered
all
its
grassy
order
*NL*
and
decent
quiet
.
*NL*
*NL*
Near
that
brick
grave
there
was
a
tomb
erected
,
very
soon
after
the
*NL*
flood
,
for
two
bodies
that
were
found
in
close
embrace
;
and
it
was
*NL*
visited
at
different
moments
by
two
men
who
both
felt
that
their
*NL*
keenest
joy
and
keenest
sorrow
were
forever
buried
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
them
visited
the
tomb
again
with
a
sweet
face
beside
him
;
but
*NL*
that
was
years
after
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
other
was
always
solitary
.
His
great
companionship
was
among
the
*NL*
trees
of
the
Red
Deeps
,
where
the
buried
joy
seemed
still
to
hover
,
*NL*
like
a
revisiting
spirit
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
tomb
bore
the
names
of
Tom
and
Maggie
Tulliver
,
and
below
the
*NL*
names
it
was
written
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
their
death
they
were
not
divided
