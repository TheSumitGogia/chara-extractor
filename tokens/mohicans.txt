THE

OF

INTRODUCTION
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
believed
that
the
scene
of
this
tale
,
and
most
of
the
information
*NL*
necessary
to
understand
its
allusions
,
are
rendered
sufficiently
obvious
*NL*
to
the
reader
in
the
text
itself
,
or
in
the
accompanying
notes
.
Still
*NL*
there
is
so
much
obscurity
in
the
Indian
traditions
,
and
so
much
*NL*
confusion
in
the
Indian
names
,
as
to
render
some
explanation
useful
.
*NL*
*NL*
Few
men
exhibit
greater
diversity
,
or
,
if
we
may
so
express
it
,
greater
*NL*
antithesis
of
character
,
than
the
native
warrior
of
North
America
.
*NL*
In
war
,
he
is
daring
,
boastful
,
cunning
,
ruthless
,
self-denying
,
*NL*
and
self-devoted
;
in
peace
,
just
,
generous
,
hospitable
,
revengeful
,
*NL*
superstitious
,
modest
,
and
commonly
chaste
.
These
are
qualities
,
it
*NL*
is
true
,
which
do
not
distinguish
all
alike
;
but
they
are
so
far
the
*NL*
predominating
traits
of
these
remarkable
people
as
to
be
characteristic
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
generally
believed
that
the
Aborigines
of
the
American
continent
*NL*
have
an
Asiatic
origin
.
There
are
many
physical
as
well
as
moral
facts
*NL*
which
corroborate
this
opinion
,
and
some
few
that
would
seem
to
weigh
*NL*
against
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
color
of
the
Indian
,
the
writer
believes
,
is
peculiar
to
himself
,
*NL*
and
while
his
cheek-bones
have
a
very
striking
indication
of
a
Tartar
*NL*
origin
,
his
eyes
have
not
.
Climate
may
have
had
great
influence
on
*NL*
the
former
,
but
it
is
difficult
to
see
how
it
can
have
produced
the
*NL*
substantial
difference
which
exists
in
the
latter
.
The
imagery
of
the
*NL*
Indian
,
both
in
his
poetry
and
in
his
oratory
,
is
oriental
;
chastened
,
*NL*
and
perhaps
improved
,
by
the
limited
range
of
his
practical
knowledge
.
*NL*
He
draws
his
metaphors
from
the
clouds
,
the
seasons
,
the
birds
,
the
*NL*
beasts
,
and
the
vegetable
world
.
In
this
,
perhaps
,
he
does
no
more
than
*NL*
any
other
energetic
and
imaginative
race
would
do
,
being
compelled
to
*NL*
set
bounds
to
fancy
by
experience
;
but
the
North
American
Indian
clothes
*NL*
his
ideas
in
a
dress
which
is
different
from
that
of
the
African
,
and
*NL*
is
oriental
in
itself
.
His
language
has
the
richness
and
sententious
*NL*
fullness
of
the
Chinese
.
He
will
express
a
phrase
in
a
word
,
and
he
will
*NL*
qualify
the
meaning
of
an
entire
sentence
by
a
syllable
;
he
will
even
*NL*
convey
different
significations
by
the
simplest
inflections
of
the
*NL*
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
Philologists
have
said
that
there
are
but
two
or
three
languages
,
*NL*
properly
speaking
,
among
all
the
numerous
tribes
which
formerly
occupied
*NL*
the
country
that
now
composes
the
United
States
.
They
ascribe
the
known
*NL*
difficulty
one
people
have
to
understand
another
to
corruptions
and
*NL*
dialects
.
The
writer
remembers
to
have
been
present
at
an
interview
*NL*
between
two
chiefs
of
the
Great
Prairies
west
of
the
Mississippi
,
and
*NL*
when
an
interpreter
was
in
attendance
who
spoke
both
their
languages
.
*NL*
The
warriors
appeared
to
be
on
the
most
friendly
terms
,
and
seemingly
*NL*
conversed
much
together
;
yet
,
according
to
the
account
of
the
*NL*
interpreter
,
each
was
absolutely
ignorant
of
what
the
other
said
.
*NL*
They
were
of
hostile
tribes
,
brought
together
by
the
influence
of
the
*NL*
American
government
;
and
it
is
worthy
of
remark
,
that
a
common
policy
*NL*
led
them
both
to
adopt
the
same
subject
.
They
mutually
exhorted
each
*NL*
other
to
be
of
use
in
the
event
of
the
chances
of
war
throwing
either
of
*NL*
the
parties
into
the
hands
of
his
enemies
.
Whatever
may
be
the
truth
,
*NL*
as
respects
the
root
and
the
genius
of
the
Indian
tongues
,
it
is
quite
*NL*
certain
they
are
now
so
distinct
in
their
words
as
to
possess
most
of
*NL*
the
disadvantages
of
strange
languages
;
hence
much
of
the
embarrassment
*NL*
that
has
arisen
in
learning
their
histories
,
and
most
of
the
uncertainty
*NL*
which
exists
in
their
traditions
.
*NL*
*NL*
Like
nations
of
higher
pretensions
,
the
American
Indian
gives
a
very
*NL*
different
account
of
his
own
tribe
or
race
from
that
which
is
given
by
*NL*
other
people
.
He
is
much
addicted
to
overestimating
his
own
perfections
,
*NL*
and
to
undervaluing
those
of
his
rival
or
his
enemy
;
a
trait
which
may
*NL*
possibly
be
thought
corroborative
of
the
Mosaic
account
of
the
creation
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
whites
have
assisted
greatly
in
rendering
the
traditions
of
the
*NL*
Aborigines
more
obscure
by
their
own
manner
of
corrupting
names
.
Thus
,
*NL*
the
term
used
in
the
title
of
this
book
has
undergone
the
changes
of
*NL*
Mahicanni
,
Mohicans
,
and
Mohegans
;
the
latter
being
the
word
commonly
*NL*
used
by
the
whites
.
When
it
is
remembered
that
the
Dutch
-LRB-
who
first
*NL*
settled
New
York
-RRB-
,
the
English
,
and
the
French
,
all
gave
appellations
*NL*
to
the
tribes
that
dwelt
within
the
country
which
is
the
scene
of
this
*NL*
story
,
and
that
the
Indians
not
only
gave
different
names
to
their
*NL*
enemies
,
but
frequently
to
themselves
,
the
cause
of
the
confusion
will
*NL*
be
understood
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
these
pages
,
Lenni-Lenape
,
Lenope
,
Delawares
,
Wapanachki
,
and
*NL*
Mohicans
,
all
mean
the
same
people
,
or
tribes
of
the
same
stock
.
The
*NL*
Mengwe
,
the
Maquas
,
the
Mingoes
,
and
the
Iroquois
,
though
not
all
*NL*
strictly
the
same
,
are
identified
frequently
by
the
speakers
,
being
*NL*
politically
confederated
and
opposed
to
those
just
named
.
Mingo
was
a
*NL*
term
of
peculiar
reproach
,
as
were
Mengwe
and
Maqua
in
a
less
degree
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Mohicans
were
the
possessors
of
the
country
first
occupied
by
the
*NL*
Europeans
in
this
portion
of
the
continent
.
They
were
,
consequently
,
*NL*
the
first
dispossessed
;
and
the
seemingly
inevitable
fate
of
all
these
*NL*
people
,
who
disappear
before
the
advances
,
or
it
might
be
termed
the
*NL*
inroads
,
of
civilization
,
as
the
verdure
of
their
native
forests
falls
*NL*
before
the
nipping
frosts
,
is
represented
as
having
already
befallen
*NL*
them
.
There
is
sufficient
historical
truth
in
the
picture
to
justify
the
*NL*
use
that
has
been
made
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
point
of
fact
,
the
country
which
is
the
scene
of
the
following
tale
*NL*
has
undergone
as
little
change
,
since
the
historical
events
alluded
to
*NL*
had
place
,
as
almost
any
other
district
of
equal
extent
within
the
whole
*NL*
limits
of
the
United
States
.
There
are
fashionable
and
well-attended
*NL*
watering-places
at
and
near
the
spring
where
Hawkeye
halted
to
drink
,
*NL*
and
roads
traverse
the
forests
where
he
and
his
friends
were
compelled
*NL*
to
journey
without
even
a
path
.
Glen
's
has
a
large
village
;
and
while
*NL*
William
Henry
,
and
even
a
fortress
of
later
date
,
are
only
to
be
traced
*NL*
as
ruins
,
there
is
another
village
on
the
shores
of
the
Horican
.
But
,
*NL*
beyond
this
,
the
enterprise
and
energy
of
a
people
who
have
done
so
much
*NL*
in
other
places
have
done
little
here
.
The
whole
of
that
wilderness
,
*NL*
in
which
the
latter
incidents
of
the
legend
occurred
,
is
nearly
a
*NL*
wilderness
still
,
though
the
red
man
has
entirely
deserted
this
part
of
*NL*
the
state
.
Of
all
the
tribes
named
in
these
pages
,
there
exist
only
a
*NL*
few
half-civilized
beings
of
the
Oneidas
,
on
the
reservations
of
their
*NL*
people
in
New
York
.
The
rest
have
disappeared
,
either
from
the
regions
*NL*
in
which
their
fathers
dwelt
,
or
altogether
from
the
earth
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
one
point
on
which
we
would
wish
to
say
a
word
before
closing
*NL*
this
preface
.
Hawkeye
calls
the
Lac
du
Saint
Sacrement
,
the
``
Horican
.
''
*NL*
As
we
believe
this
to
be
an
appropriation
of
the
name
that
has
its
*NL*
origin
with
ourselves
,
the
time
has
arrived
,
perhaps
,
when
the
fact
*NL*
should
be
frankly
admitted
.
While
writing
this
book
,
fully
a
quarter
of
*NL*
a
century
since
,
it
occurred
to
us
that
the
French
name
of
this
lake
*NL*
was
too
complicated
,
the
American
too
commonplace
,
and
the
Indian
too
*NL*
unpronounceable
,
for
either
to
be
used
familiarly
in
a
work
of
fiction
.
*NL*
Looking
over
an
ancient
map
,
it
was
ascertained
that
a
tribe
of
Indians
,
*NL*
called
``
Les
Horicans
''
by
the
French
,
existed
in
the
neighborhood
of
this
*NL*
beautiful
sheet
of
water
.
As
every
word
uttered
by
Natty
Bumppo
was
*NL*
not
to
be
received
as
rigid
truth
,
we
took
the
liberty
of
putting
the
*NL*
``
Horican
''
into
his
mouth
,
as
the
substitute
for
``
Lake
George
.
''
The
name
*NL*
has
appeared
to
find
favor
,
and
all
things
considered
,
it
may
possibly
*NL*
be
quite
as
well
to
let
it
stand
,
instead
of
going
back
to
the
House
of
*NL*
Hanover
for
the
appellation
of
our
finest
sheet
of
water
.
We
relieve
our
*NL*
conscience
by
the
confession
,
at
all
events
leaving
it
to
exercise
its
*NL*
authority
as
it
may
see
fit
.

CHAPTER
1
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mine
ear
is
open
,
and
my
heart
prepared
:
*NL*
The
worst
is
wordly
loss
thou
canst
unfold
:
--
*NL*
Say
,
is
my
kingdom
lost
?
''
--
Shakespeare
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
feature
peculiar
to
the
colonial
wars
of
North
America
,
that
*NL*
the
toils
and
dangers
of
the
wilderness
were
to
be
encountered
before
*NL*
the
adverse
hosts
could
meet
.
A
wide
and
apparently
an
impervious
*NL*
boundary
of
forests
severed
the
possessions
of
the
hostile
provinces
*NL*
of
France
and
England
.
The
hardy
colonist
,
and
the
trained
European
who
*NL*
fought
at
his
side
,
frequently
expended
months
in
struggling
against
*NL*
the
rapids
of
the
streams
,
or
in
effecting
the
rugged
passes
of
the
*NL*
mountains
,
in
quest
of
an
opportunity
to
exhibit
their
courage
in
a
more
*NL*
martial
conflict
.
But
,
emulating
the
patience
and
self-denial
of
the
*NL*
practiced
native
warriors
,
they
learned
to
overcome
every
difficulty
;
*NL*
and
it
would
seem
that
,
in
time
,
there
was
no
recess
of
the
woods
so
*NL*
dark
,
nor
any
secret
place
so
lovely
,
that
it
might
claim
exemption
*NL*
from
the
inroads
of
those
who
had
pledged
their
blood
to
satiate
their
*NL*
vengeance
,
or
to
uphold
the
cold
and
selfish
policy
of
the
distant
*NL*
monarchs
of
Europe
.
*NL*
*NL*
Perhaps
no
district
throughout
the
wide
extent
of
the
intermediate
*NL*
frontiers
can
furnish
a
livelier
picture
of
the
cruelty
and
fierceness
*NL*
of
the
savage
warfare
of
those
periods
than
the
country
which
lies
*NL*
between
the
head
waters
of
the
Hudson
and
the
adjacent
lakes
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
facilities
which
nature
had
there
offered
to
the
march
of
the
*NL*
combatants
were
too
obvious
to
be
neglected
.
The
lengthened
sheet
of
*NL*
the
Champlain
stretched
from
the
frontiers
of
Canada
,
deep
within
the
*NL*
borders
of
the
neighboring
province
of
New
York
,
forming
a
natural
*NL*
passage
across
half
the
distance
that
the
French
were
compelled
to
*NL*
master
in
order
to
strike
their
enemies
.
Near
its
southern
termination
,
*NL*
it
received
the
contributions
of
another
lake
,
whose
waters
were
so
*NL*
limpid
as
to
have
been
exclusively
selected
by
the
Jesuit
missionaries
*NL*
to
perform
the
typical
purification
of
baptism
,
and
to
obtain
for
it
*NL*
the
title
of
lake
``
du
Saint
Sacrement
.
''
The
less
zealous
English
thought
*NL*
they
conferred
a
sufficient
honor
on
its
unsullied
fountains
,
when
they
*NL*
bestowed
the
name
of
their
reigning
prince
,
the
second
of
the
house
of
*NL*
Hanover
.
The
two
united
to
rob
the
untutored
possessors
of
its
wooded
*NL*
scenery
of
their
native
right
to
perpetuate
its
original
appellation
of
*NL*
``
Horican
.
''
*
*NL*
*NL*
*
As
each
nation
of
the
Indians
had
its
language
or
its
*NL*
dialect
,
they
usually
gave
different
names
to
the
same
*NL*
places
,
though
nearly
all
of
their
appellations
were
*NL*
descriptive
of
the
object
.
Thus
a
literal
translation
of
the
*NL*
name
of
this
beautiful
sheet
of
water
,
used
by
the
tribe
*NL*
that
dwelt
on
its
banks
,
would
be
``
The
Tail
of
the
Lake
.
''
*NL*
Lake
George
,
as
it
is
vulgarly
,
and
now
,
indeed
,
legally
,
*NL*
called
,
forms
a
sort
of
tail
to
Lake
Champlain
,
when
viewed
*NL*
on
the
map
.
Hence
,
the
name
.
*NL*
*NL*
Winding
its
way
among
countless
islands
,
and
imbedded
in
mountains
,
the
*NL*
``
holy
lake
''
extended
a
dozen
leagues
still
further
to
the
south
.
With
*NL*
the
high
plain
that
there
interposed
itself
to
the
further
passage
of
*NL*
the
water
,
commenced
a
portage
of
as
many
miles
,
which
conducted
the
*NL*
adventurer
to
the
banks
of
the
Hudson
,
at
a
point
where
,
with
the
usual
*NL*
obstructions
of
the
rapids
,
or
rifts
,
as
they
were
then
termed
in
the
*NL*
language
of
the
country
,
the
river
became
navigable
to
the
tide
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
,
in
the
pursuit
of
their
daring
plans
of
annoyance
,
the
restless
*NL*
enterprise
of
the
French
even
attempted
the
distant
and
difficult
*NL*
gorges
of
the
Alleghany
,
it
may
easily
be
imagined
that
their
proverbial
*NL*
acuteness
would
not
overlook
the
natural
advantages
of
the
district
we
*NL*
have
just
described
.
It
became
,
emphatically
,
the
bloody
arena
,
in
which
*NL*
most
of
the
battles
for
the
mastery
of
the
colonies
were
contested
.
*NL*
Forts
were
erected
at
the
different
points
that
commanded
the
facilities
*NL*
of
the
route
,
and
were
taken
and
retaken
,
razed
and
rebuilt
,
as
victory
*NL*
alighted
on
the
hostile
banners
.
While
the
husbandman
shrank
back
from
*NL*
the
dangerous
passes
,
within
the
safer
boundaries
of
the
more
ancient
*NL*
settlements
,
armies
larger
than
those
that
had
often
disposed
of
the
*NL*
scepters
of
the
mother
countries
,
were
seen
to
bury
themselves
in
these
*NL*
forests
,
whence
they
rarely
returned
but
in
skeleton
bands
,
that
were
*NL*
haggard
with
care
or
dejected
by
defeat
.
Though
the
arts
of
peace
were
*NL*
unknown
to
this
fatal
region
,
its
forests
were
alive
with
men
;
its
*NL*
shades
and
glens
rang
with
the
sounds
of
martial
music
,
and
the
echoes
*NL*
of
its
mountains
threw
back
the
laugh
,
or
repeated
the
wanton
cry
,
*NL*
of
many
a
gallant
and
reckless
youth
,
as
he
hurried
by
them
,
in
the
*NL*
noontide
of
his
spirits
,
to
slumber
in
a
long
night
of
forgetfulness
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
in
this
scene
of
strife
and
bloodshed
that
the
incidents
we
*NL*
shall
attempt
to
relate
occurred
,
during
the
third
year
of
the
war
*NL*
which
England
and
France
last
waged
for
the
possession
of
a
country
that
*NL*
neither
was
destined
to
retain
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
imbecility
of
her
military
leaders
abroad
,
and
the
fatal
want
of
*NL*
energy
in
her
councils
at
home
,
had
lowered
the
character
of
Great
*NL*
Britain
from
the
proud
elevation
on
which
it
had
been
placed
by
the
*NL*
talents
and
enterprise
of
her
former
warriors
and
statesmen
.
No
longer
*NL*
dreaded
by
her
enemies
,
her
servants
were
fast
losing
the
confidence
*NL*
of
self-respect
.
In
this
mortifying
abasement
,
the
colonists
,
though
*NL*
innocent
of
her
imbecility
,
and
too
humble
to
be
the
agents
of
her
*NL*
blunders
,
were
but
the
natural
participators
.
They
had
recently
seen
a
*NL*
chosen
army
from
that
country
,
which
,
reverencing
as
a
mother
,
they
*NL*
had
blindly
believed
invincible
--
an
army
led
by
a
chief
who
had
been
*NL*
selected
from
a
crowd
of
trained
warriors
,
for
his
rare
military
*NL*
endowments
,
disgracefully
routed
by
a
handful
of
French
and
Indians
,
and
*NL*
only
saved
from
annihilation
by
the
coolness
and
spirit
of
a
Virginian
*NL*
boy
,
whose
riper
fame
has
since
diffused
itself
,
with
the
steady
*NL*
influence
of
moral
truth
,
to
the
uttermost
confines
of
Christendom
.
*
A
*NL*
wide
frontier
had
been
laid
naked
by
this
unexpected
disaster
,
and
more
*NL*
substantial
evils
were
preceded
by
a
thousand
fanciful
and
imaginary
*NL*
dangers
.
The
alarmed
colonists
believed
that
the
yells
of
the
savages
*NL*
mingled
with
every
fitful
gust
of
wind
that
issued
from
the
interminable
*NL*
forests
of
the
west
.
The
terrific
character
of
their
merciless
enemies
*NL*
increased
immeasurably
the
natural
horrors
of
warfare
.
Numberless
recent
*NL*
massacres
were
still
vivid
in
their
recollections
;
nor
was
there
any
*NL*
ear
in
the
provinces
so
deaf
as
not
to
have
drunk
in
with
avidity
the
*NL*
narrative
of
some
fearful
tale
of
midnight
murder
,
in
which
the
natives
*NL*
of
the
forests
were
the
principal
and
barbarous
actors
.
As
the
credulous
*NL*
and
excited
traveler
related
the
hazardous
chances
of
the
wilderness
,
*NL*
the
blood
of
the
timid
curdled
with
terror
,
and
mothers
cast
anxious
*NL*
glances
even
at
those
children
which
slumbered
within
the
security
of
*NL*
the
largest
towns
.
In
short
,
the
magnifying
influence
of
fear
began
to
*NL*
set
at
naught
the
calculations
of
reason
,
and
to
render
those
who
should
*NL*
have
remembered
their
manhood
,
the
slaves
of
the
basest
passions
.
Even
*NL*
the
most
confident
and
the
stoutest
hearts
began
to
think
the
issue
*NL*
of
the
contest
was
becoming
doubtful
;
and
that
abject
class
was
hourly
*NL*
increasing
in
numbers
,
who
thought
they
foresaw
all
the
possessions
of
*NL*
the
English
crown
in
America
subdued
by
their
Christian
foes
,
or
laid
*NL*
waste
by
the
inroads
of
their
relentless
allies
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
Washington
,
who
,
after
uselessly
admonishing
the
European
*NL*
general
of
the
danger
into
which
he
was
heedlessly
running
,
*NL*
saved
the
remnants
of
the
British
army
,
on
this
occasion
,
by
*NL*
his
decision
and
courage
.
The
reputation
earned
by
*NL*
Washington
in
this
battle
was
the
principal
cause
of
his
*NL*
being
selected
to
command
the
American
armies
at
a
later
*NL*
day
.
It
is
a
circumstance
worthy
of
observation
,
that
while
*NL*
all
America
rang
with
his
well-merited
reputation
,
his
name
*NL*
does
not
occur
in
any
European
account
of
the
battle
;
at
*NL*
least
the
author
has
searched
for
it
without
success
.
In
*NL*
this
manner
does
the
mother
country
absorb
even
the
fame
,
*NL*
under
that
system
of
rule
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
,
therefore
,
intelligence
was
received
at
the
fort
which
covered
the
*NL*
southern
termination
of
the
portage
between
the
Hudson
and
the
lakes
,
*NL*
that
Montcalm
had
been
seen
moving
up
the
Champlain
,
with
an
army
*NL*
``
numerous
as
the
leaves
on
the
trees
,
''
its
truth
was
admitted
with
more
*NL*
of
the
craven
reluctance
of
fear
than
with
the
stern
joy
that
a
warrior
*NL*
should
feel
,
in
finding
an
enemy
within
reach
of
his
blow
.
The
news
had
*NL*
been
brought
,
toward
the
decline
of
a
day
in
midsummer
,
by
an
Indian
*NL*
runner
,
who
also
bore
an
urgent
request
from
Munro
,
the
commander
of
*NL*
a
work
on
the
shore
of
the
``
holy
lake
,
''
for
a
speedy
and
powerful
*NL*
reinforcement
.
It
has
already
been
mentioned
that
the
distance
between
*NL*
these
two
posts
was
less
than
five
leagues
.
The
rude
path
,
which
*NL*
originally
formed
their
line
of
communication
,
had
been
widened
for
the
*NL*
passage
of
wagons
;
so
that
the
distance
which
had
been
traveled
by
the
*NL*
son
of
the
forest
in
two
hours
,
might
easily
be
effected
by
a
detachment
*NL*
of
troops
,
with
their
necessary
baggage
,
between
the
rising
and
setting
*NL*
of
a
summer
sun
.
The
loyal
servants
of
the
British
crown
had
given
to
*NL*
one
of
these
forest-fastnesses
the
name
of
William
Henry
,
and
to
the
*NL*
other
that
of
Fort
Edward
,
calling
each
after
a
favorite
prince
of
the
*NL*
reigning
family
.
The
veteran
Scotchman
just
named
held
the
first
,
with
*NL*
a
regiment
of
regulars
and
a
few
provincials
;
a
force
really
by
far
*NL*
too
small
to
make
head
against
the
formidable
power
that
Montcalm
was
*NL*
leading
to
the
foot
of
his
earthen
mounds
.
At
the
latter
,
however
,
*NL*
lay
General
Webb
,
who
commanded
the
armies
of
the
king
in
the
northern
*NL*
provinces
,
with
a
body
of
more
than
five
thousand
men
.
By
uniting
the
*NL*
several
detachments
of
his
command
,
this
officer
might
have
arrayed
*NL*
nearly
double
that
number
of
combatants
against
the
enterprising
*NL*
Frenchman
,
who
had
ventured
so
far
from
his
reinforcements
,
with
an
army
*NL*
but
little
superior
in
numbers
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
under
the
influence
of
their
degraded
fortunes
,
both
officers
and
*NL*
men
appeared
better
disposed
to
await
the
approach
of
their
formidable
*NL*
antagonists
,
within
their
works
,
than
to
resist
the
progress
of
their
*NL*
march
,
by
emulating
the
successful
example
of
the
French
at
Fort
du
*NL*
Quesne
,
and
striking
a
blow
on
their
advance
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
first
surprise
of
the
intelligence
had
a
little
abated
,
a
*NL*
rumor
was
spread
through
the
entrenched
camp
,
which
stretched
along
the
*NL*
margin
of
the
Hudson
,
forming
a
chain
of
outworks
to
the
body
of
the
*NL*
fort
itself
,
that
a
chosen
detachment
of
fifteen
hundred
men
was
to
*NL*
depart
,
with
the
dawn
,
for
William
Henry
,
the
post
at
the
northern
*NL*
extremity
of
the
portage
.
That
which
at
first
was
only
rumor
,
*NL*
soon
became
certainty
,
as
orders
passed
from
the
quarters
of
the
*NL*
commander-in-chief
to
the
several
corps
he
had
selected
for
this
*NL*
service
,
to
prepare
for
their
speedy
departure
.
All
doubts
as
to
the
*NL*
intention
of
Webb
now
vanished
,
and
an
hour
or
two
of
hurried
footsteps
*NL*
and
anxious
faces
succeeded
.
The
novice
in
the
military
art
flew
from
*NL*
point
to
point
,
retarding
his
own
preparations
by
the
excess
of
his
*NL*
violent
and
somewhat
distempered
zeal
;
while
the
more
practiced
veteran
*NL*
made
his
arrangements
with
a
deliberation
that
scorned
every
appearance
*NL*
of
haste
;
though
his
sober
lineaments
and
anxious
eye
sufficiently
*NL*
betrayed
that
he
had
no
very
strong
professional
relish
for
the
,
as
yet
,
*NL*
untried
and
dreaded
warfare
of
the
wilderness
.
At
length
the
sun
set
in
*NL*
a
flood
of
glory
,
behind
the
distant
western
hills
,
and
as
darkness
drew
*NL*
its
veil
around
the
secluded
spot
the
sounds
of
preparation
diminished
;
*NL*
the
last
light
finally
disappeared
from
the
log
cabin
of
some
officer
;
*NL*
the
trees
cast
their
deeper
shadows
over
the
mounds
and
the
rippling
*NL*
stream
,
and
a
silence
soon
pervaded
the
camp
,
as
deep
as
that
which
*NL*
reigned
in
the
vast
forest
by
which
it
was
environed
.
*NL*
*NL*
According
to
the
orders
of
the
preceding
night
,
the
heavy
sleep
of
the
*NL*
army
was
broken
by
the
rolling
of
the
warning
drums
,
whose
rattling
*NL*
echoes
were
heard
issuing
,
on
the
damp
morning
air
,
out
of
every
vista
*NL*
of
the
woods
,
just
as
day
began
to
draw
the
shaggy
outlines
of
some
tall
*NL*
pines
of
the
vicinity
,
on
the
opening
brightness
of
a
soft
and
cloudless
*NL*
eastern
sky
.
In
an
instant
the
whole
camp
was
in
motion
;
the
meanest
*NL*
soldier
arousing
from
his
lair
to
witness
the
departure
of
his
comrades
,
*NL*
and
to
share
in
the
excitement
and
incidents
of
the
hour
.
The
simple
*NL*
array
of
the
chosen
band
was
soon
completed
.
While
the
regular
and
*NL*
trained
hirelings
of
the
king
marched
with
haughtiness
to
the
right
of
*NL*
the
line
,
the
less
pretending
colonists
took
their
humbler
position
*NL*
on
its
left
,
with
a
docility
that
long
practice
had
rendered
easy
.
*NL*
The
scouts
departed
;
strong
guards
preceded
and
followed
the
lumbering
*NL*
vehicles
that
bore
the
baggage
;
and
before
the
gray
light
of
the
morning
*NL*
was
mellowed
by
the
rays
of
the
sun
,
the
main
body
of
the
combatants
*NL*
wheeled
into
column
,
and
left
the
encampment
with
a
show
of
high
*NL*
military
bearing
,
that
served
to
drown
the
slumbering
apprehensions
of
*NL*
many
a
novice
,
who
was
now
about
to
make
his
first
essay
in
arms
.
While
*NL*
in
view
of
their
admiring
comrades
,
the
same
proud
front
and
ordered
*NL*
array
was
observed
,
until
the
notes
of
their
fifes
growing
fainter
in
*NL*
distance
,
the
forest
at
length
appeared
to
swallow
up
the
living
mass
*NL*
which
had
slowly
entered
its
bosom
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
deepest
sounds
of
the
retiring
and
invisible
column
had
ceased
to
*NL*
be
borne
on
the
breeze
to
the
listeners
,
and
the
latest
straggler
had
*NL*
already
disappeared
in
pursuit
;
but
there
still
remained
the
signs
*NL*
of
another
departure
,
before
a
log
cabin
of
unusual
size
and
*NL*
accommodations
,
in
front
of
which
those
sentinels
paced
their
rounds
,
*NL*
who
were
known
to
guard
the
person
of
the
English
general
.
At
this
spot
*NL*
were
gathered
some
half
dozen
horses
,
caparisoned
in
a
manner
which
*NL*
showed
that
two
,
at
least
,
were
destined
to
bear
the
persons
of
females
,
*NL*
of
a
rank
that
it
was
not
usual
to
meet
so
far
in
the
wilds
of
the
*NL*
country
.
A
third
wore
trappings
and
arms
of
an
officer
of
the
staff
;
*NL*
while
the
rest
,
from
the
plainness
of
the
housings
,
and
the
traveling
*NL*
mails
with
which
they
were
encumbered
,
were
evidently
fitted
for
the
*NL*
reception
of
as
many
menials
,
who
were
,
seemingly
,
already
waiting
*NL*
the
pleasure
of
those
they
served
.
At
a
respectful
distance
from
this
*NL*
unusual
show
,
were
gathered
divers
groups
of
curious
idlers
;
some
*NL*
admiring
the
blood
and
bone
of
the
high-mettled
military
charger
,
*NL*
and
others
gazing
at
the
preparations
,
with
the
dull
wonder
of
vulgar
*NL*
curiosity
.
There
was
one
man
,
however
,
who
,
by
his
countenance
and
*NL*
actions
,
formed
a
marked
exception
to
those
who
composed
the
latter
*NL*
class
of
spectators
,
being
neither
idle
,
nor
seemingly
very
ignorant
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
person
of
this
individual
was
to
the
last
degree
ungainly
,
without
*NL*
being
in
any
particular
manner
deformed
.
He
had
all
the
bones
and
joints
*NL*
of
other
men
,
without
any
of
their
proportions
.
Erect
,
his
stature
*NL*
surpassed
that
of
his
fellows
;
though
seated
,
he
appeared
reduced
within
*NL*
the
ordinary
limits
of
the
race
.
The
same
contrariety
in
his
members
*NL*
seemed
to
exist
throughout
the
whole
man
.
His
head
was
large
;
his
*NL*
shoulders
narrow
;
his
arms
long
and
dangling
;
while
his
hands
were
*NL*
small
,
if
not
delicate
.
His
legs
and
thighs
were
thin
,
nearly
to
*NL*
emaciation
,
but
of
extraordinary
length
;
and
his
knees
would
have
*NL*
been
considered
tremendous
,
had
they
not
been
outdone
by
the
broader
*NL*
foundations
on
which
this
false
superstructure
of
blended
human
orders
*NL*
was
so
profanely
reared
.
The
ill-assorted
and
injudicious
attire
of
the
*NL*
individual
only
served
to
render
his
awkwardness
more
conspicuous
.
A
*NL*
sky-blue
coat
,
with
short
and
broad
skirts
and
low
cape
,
exposed
a
long
,
*NL*
thin
neck
,
and
longer
and
thinner
legs
,
to
the
worst
animadversions
*NL*
of
the
evil-disposed
.
His
nether
garment
was
a
yellow
nankeen
,
closely
*NL*
fitted
to
the
shape
,
and
tied
at
his
bunches
of
knees
by
large
knots
of
*NL*
white
ribbon
,
a
good
deal
sullied
by
use
.
Clouded
cotton
stockings
,
and
*NL*
shoes
,
on
one
of
the
latter
of
which
was
a
plated
spur
,
completed
the
*NL*
costume
of
the
lower
extremity
of
this
figure
,
no
curve
or
angle
of
*NL*
which
was
concealed
,
but
,
on
the
other
hand
,
studiously
exhibited
,
*NL*
through
the
vanity
or
simplicity
of
its
owner
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
beneath
the
flap
of
an
enormous
pocket
of
a
soiled
vest
of
embossed
*NL*
silk
,
heavily
ornamented
with
tarnished
silver
lace
,
projected
an
*NL*
instrument
,
which
,
from
being
seen
in
such
martial
company
,
might
have
*NL*
been
easily
mistaken
for
some
mischievous
and
unknown
implement
of
war
.
*NL*
Small
as
it
was
,
this
uncommon
engine
had
excited
the
curiosity
of
most
*NL*
of
the
Europeans
in
the
camp
,
though
several
of
the
provincials
*NL*
were
seen
to
handle
it
,
not
only
without
fear
,
but
with
the
utmost
*NL*
familiarity
.
A
large
,
civil
cocked
hat
,
like
those
worn
by
clergymen
*NL*
within
the
last
thirty
years
,
surmounted
the
whole
,
furnishing
dignity
*NL*
to
a
good-natured
and
somewhat
vacant
countenance
,
that
apparently
*NL*
needed
such
artificial
aid
,
to
support
the
gravity
of
some
high
and
*NL*
extraordinary
trust
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
the
common
herd
stood
aloof
,
in
deference
to
the
quarters
of
Webb
,
*NL*
the
figure
we
have
described
stalked
into
the
center
of
the
domestics
,
*NL*
freely
expressing
his
censures
or
commendations
on
the
merits
of
the
*NL*
horses
,
as
by
chance
they
displeased
or
satisfied
his
judgment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
beast
,
I
rather
conclude
,
friend
,
is
not
of
home
raising
,
but
is
*NL*
from
foreign
lands
,
or
perhaps
from
the
little
island
itself
over
the
*NL*
blue
water
?
''
he
said
,
in
a
voice
as
remarkable
for
the
softness
and
*NL*
sweetness
of
its
tones
,
as
was
his
person
for
its
rare
proportions
;
``
I
*NL*
may
speak
of
these
things
,
and
be
no
braggart
;
for
I
have
been
down
at
*NL*
both
havens
;
that
which
is
situate
at
the
mouth
of
Thames
,
and
is
named
*NL*
after
the
capital
of
Old
England
,
and
that
which
is
called
`
Haven
'
,
with
*NL*
the
addition
of
the
word
`
New
'
;
and
have
seen
the
scows
and
brigantines
*NL*
collecting
their
droves
,
like
the
gathering
to
the
ark
,
being
outward
*NL*
bound
to
the
Island
of
Jamaica
,
for
the
purpose
of
barter
and
traffic
*NL*
in
four-footed
animals
;
but
never
before
have
I
beheld
a
beast
which
*NL*
verified
the
true
scripture
war-horse
like
this
:
`
He
paweth
in
the
*NL*
valley
,
and
rejoiceth
in
his
strength
;
he
goeth
on
to
meet
the
armed
*NL*
men
.
He
saith
among
the
trumpets
,
Ha
,
ha
;
and
he
smelleth
the
battle
*NL*
afar
off
,
the
thunder
of
the
captains
,
and
the
shouting
'
It
would
seem
*NL*
that
the
stock
of
the
horse
of
Israel
had
descended
to
our
own
time
;
*NL*
would
it
not
,
friend
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Receiving
no
reply
to
this
extraordinary
appeal
,
which
in
truth
,
as
it
*NL*
was
delivered
with
the
vigor
of
full
and
sonorous
tones
,
merited
some
*NL*
sort
of
notice
,
he
who
had
thus
sung
forth
the
language
of
the
holy
*NL*
book
turned
to
the
silent
figure
to
whom
he
had
unwittingly
addressed
*NL*
himself
,
and
found
a
new
and
more
powerful
subject
of
admiration
in
the
*NL*
object
that
encountered
his
gaze
.
His
eyes
fell
on
the
still
,
upright
,
*NL*
and
rigid
form
of
the
``
Indian
runner
,
''
who
had
borne
to
the
camp
the
*NL*
unwelcome
tidings
of
the
preceding
evening
.
Although
in
a
state
of
*NL*
perfect
repose
,
and
apparently
disregarding
,
with
characteristic
*NL*
stoicism
,
the
excitement
and
bustle
around
him
,
there
was
a
sullen
*NL*
fierceness
mingled
with
the
quiet
of
the
savage
,
that
was
likely
to
*NL*
arrest
the
attention
of
much
more
experienced
eyes
than
those
which
now
*NL*
scanned
him
,
in
unconcealed
amazement
.
The
native
bore
both
the
tomahawk
*NL*
and
knife
of
his
tribe
;
and
yet
his
appearance
was
not
altogether
that
*NL*
of
a
warrior
.
On
the
contrary
,
there
was
an
air
of
neglect
about
his
*NL*
person
,
like
that
which
might
have
proceeded
from
great
and
recent
*NL*
exertion
,
which
he
had
not
yet
found
leisure
to
repair
.
The
colors
*NL*
of
the
war-paint
had
blended
in
dark
confusion
about
his
fierce
*NL*
countenance
,
and
rendered
his
swarthy
lineaments
still
more
savage
*NL*
and
repulsive
than
if
art
had
attempted
an
effect
which
had
been
thus
*NL*
produced
by
chance
.
His
eye
,
alone
,
which
glistened
like
a
fiery
star
*NL*
amid
lowering
clouds
,
was
to
be
seen
in
its
state
of
native
wildness
.
*NL*
For
a
single
instant
his
searching
and
yet
wary
glance
met
the
wondering
*NL*
look
of
the
other
,
and
then
changing
its
direction
,
partly
in
cunning
,
*NL*
and
partly
in
disdain
,
it
remained
fixed
,
as
if
penetrating
the
distant
*NL*
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
impossible
to
say
what
unlooked-for
remark
this
short
and
silent
*NL*
communication
,
between
two
such
singular
men
,
might
have
elicited
from
*NL*
the
white
man
,
had
not
his
active
curiosity
been
again
drawn
to
other
*NL*
objects
.
A
general
movement
among
the
domestics
,
and
a
low
sound
of
*NL*
gentle
voices
,
announced
the
approach
of
those
whose
presence
alone
*NL*
was
wanted
to
enable
the
cavalcade
to
move
.
The
simple
admirer
of
the
*NL*
war-horse
instantly
fell
back
to
a
low
,
gaunt
,
switch-tailed
mare
,
that
*NL*
was
unconsciously
gleaning
the
faded
herbage
of
the
camp
nigh
by
;
where
,
*NL*
leaning
with
one
elbow
on
the
blanket
that
concealed
an
apology
for
a
*NL*
saddle
,
he
became
a
spectator
of
the
departure
,
while
a
foal
was
quietly
*NL*
making
its
morning
repast
,
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
same
animal
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
young
man
,
in
the
dress
of
an
officer
,
conducted
to
their
steeds
two
*NL*
females
,
who
,
as
it
was
apparent
by
their
dresses
,
were
prepared
to
*NL*
encounter
the
fatigues
of
a
journey
in
the
woods
.
One
,
and
she
was
*NL*
the
more
juvenile
in
her
appearance
,
though
both
were
young
,
permitted
*NL*
glimpses
of
her
dazzling
complexion
,
fair
golden
hair
,
and
bright
blue
*NL*
eyes
,
to
be
caught
,
as
she
artlessly
suffered
the
morning
air
to
blow
*NL*
aside
the
green
veil
which
descended
low
from
her
beaver
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
flush
which
still
lingered
above
the
pines
in
the
western
sky
was
*NL*
not
more
bright
nor
delicate
than
the
bloom
on
her
cheek
;
nor
was
the
*NL*
opening
day
more
cheering
than
the
animated
smile
which
she
bestowed
on
*NL*
the
youth
,
as
he
assisted
her
into
the
saddle
.
The
other
,
who
appeared
*NL*
to
share
equally
in
the
attention
of
the
young
officer
,
concealed
her
*NL*
charms
from
the
gaze
of
the
soldiery
with
a
care
that
seemed
better
*NL*
fitted
to
the
experience
of
four
or
five
additional
years
.
It
could
be
*NL*
seen
,
however
,
that
her
person
,
though
molded
with
the
same
exquisite
*NL*
proportions
,
of
which
none
of
the
graces
were
lost
by
the
traveling
*NL*
dress
she
wore
,
was
rather
fuller
and
more
mature
than
that
of
her
*NL*
companion
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
sooner
were
these
females
seated
,
than
their
attendant
sprang
lightly
*NL*
into
the
saddle
of
the
war-horse
,
when
the
whole
three
bowed
to
Webb
,
*NL*
who
in
courtesy
,
awaited
their
parting
on
the
threshold
of
his
cabin
and
*NL*
turning
their
horses
'
heads
,
they
proceeded
at
a
slow
amble
,
followed
*NL*
by
their
train
,
toward
the
northern
entrance
of
the
encampment
.
As
they
*NL*
traversed
that
short
distance
,
not
a
voice
was
heard
among
them
;
but
*NL*
a
slight
exclamation
proceeded
from
the
younger
of
the
females
,
as
the
*NL*
Indian
runner
glided
by
her
,
unexpectedly
,
and
led
the
way
along
the
*NL*
military
road
in
her
front
.
Though
this
sudden
and
startling
movement
*NL*
of
the
Indian
produced
no
sound
from
the
other
,
in
the
surprise
her
veil
*NL*
also
was
allowed
to
open
its
folds
,
and
betrayed
an
indescribable
look
*NL*
of
pity
,
admiration
,
and
horror
,
as
her
dark
eye
followed
the
easy
*NL*
motions
of
the
savage
.
The
tresses
of
this
lady
were
shining
and
black
,
*NL*
like
the
plumage
of
the
raven
.
Her
complexion
was
not
brown
,
but
it
*NL*
rather
appeared
charged
with
the
color
of
the
rich
blood
,
that
seemed
*NL*
ready
to
burst
its
bounds
.
And
yet
there
was
neither
coarseness
nor
*NL*
want
of
shadowing
in
a
countenance
that
was
exquisitely
regular
,
and
*NL*
dignified
and
surpassingly
beautiful
.
She
smiled
,
as
if
in
pity
at
her
*NL*
own
momentary
forgetfulness
,
discovering
by
the
act
a
row
of
teeth
that
*NL*
would
have
shamed
the
purest
ivory
;
when
,
replacing
the
veil
,
she
bowed
*NL*
her
face
,
and
rode
in
silence
,
like
one
whose
thoughts
were
abstracted
*NL*
from
the
scene
around
her
.

CHAPTER

``
Sola
,
sola
,

''
*NL*
--
Shakespeare
*NL*
*NL*
While
one
of
the
lovely
beings
we
have
so
cursorily
presented
to
the
*NL*
reader
was
thus
lost
in
thought
,
the
other
quickly
recovered
from
the
*NL*
alarm
which
induced
the
exclamation
,
and
,
laughing
at
her
own
weakness
,
*NL*
she
inquired
of
the
youth
who
rode
by
her
side
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
such
specters
frequent
in
the
woods
,
Heyward
,
or
is
this
sight
an
*NL*
especial
entertainment
ordered
on
our
behalf
?
If
the
latter
,
gratitude
*NL*
must
close
our
mouths
;
but
if
the
former
,
both
Cora
and
I
shall
have
*NL*
need
to
draw
largely
on
that
stock
of
hereditary
courage
which
we
boast
,
*NL*
even
before
we
are
made
to
encounter
the
redoubtable
Montcalm
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yon
Indian
is
a
`
runner
'
of
the
army
;
and
,
after
the
fashion
of
his
*NL*
people
,
he
may
be
accounted
a
hero
,
''
returned
the
officer
.
``
He
has
*NL*
volunteered
to
guide
us
to
the
lake
,
by
a
path
but
little
known
,
*NL*
sooner
than
if
we
followed
the
tardy
movements
of
the
column
;
and
,
by
*NL*
consequence
,
more
agreeably
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
like
him
not
,
''
said
the
lady
,
shuddering
,
partly
in
assumed
,
yet
more
*NL*
in
real
terror
.
``
You
know
him
,
Duncan
,
or
you
would
not
trust
yourself
*NL*
so
freely
to
his
keeping
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
,
rather
,
Alice
,
that
I
would
not
trust
you
.
I
do
know
him
,
or
he
*NL*
would
not
have
my
confidence
,
and
least
of
all
at
this
moment
.
He
*NL*
is
said
to
be
a
Canadian
too
;
and
yet
he
served
with
our
friends
the
*NL*
Mohawks
,
who
,
as
you
know
,
are
one
of
the
six
allied
nations
.
He
was
*NL*
brought
among
us
,
as
I
have
heard
,
by
some
strange
accident
in
which
*NL*
your
father
was
interested
,
and
in
which
the
savage
was
rigidly
dealt
*NL*
by
;
but
I
forget
the
idle
tale
,
it
is
enough
,
that
he
is
now
our
*NL*
friend
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
he
has
been
my
father
's
enemy
,
I
like
him
still
less
!
''
exclaimed
the
*NL*
now
really
anxious
girl
.
``
Will
you
not
speak
to
him
,
Major
Heyward
,
that
*NL*
I
may
hear
his
tones
?
Foolish
though
it
may
be
,
you
have
often
heard
me
*NL*
avow
my
faith
in
the
tones
of
the
human
voice
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
be
in
vain
;
and
answered
,
most
probably
,
by
an
ejaculation
.
*NL*
Though
he
may
understand
it
,
he
affects
,
like
most
of
his
people
,
to
be
*NL*
ignorant
of
the
English
;
and
least
of
all
will
he
condescend
to
speak
*NL*
it
,
now
that
the
war
demands
the
utmost
exercise
of
his
dignity
.
But
*NL*
he
stops
;
the
private
path
by
which
we
are
to
journey
is
,
doubtless
,
at
*NL*
hand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
conjecture
of
Major
Heyward
was
true
.
When
they
reached
the
spot
*NL*
where
the
Indian
stood
,
pointing
into
the
thicket
that
fringed
the
*NL*
military
road
;
a
narrow
and
blind
path
,
which
might
,
with
some
little
*NL*
inconvenience
,
receive
one
person
at
a
time
,
became
visible
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
,
then
,
lies
our
way
,
''
said
the
young
man
,
in
a
low
voice
.
*NL*
``
Manifest
no
distrust
,
or
you
may
invite
the
danger
you
appear
to
*NL*
apprehend
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cora
,
what
think
you
?
''
asked
the
reluctant
fair
one
.
``
If
we
journey
*NL*
with
the
troops
,
though
we
may
find
their
presence
irksome
,
shall
we
not
*NL*
feel
better
assurance
of
our
safety
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Being
little
accustomed
to
the
practices
of
the
savages
,
Alice
,
you
*NL*
mistake
the
place
of
real
danger
,
''
said
Heyward
.
``
If
enemies
have
*NL*
reached
the
portage
at
all
,
a
thing
by
no
means
probable
,
as
our
scouts
*NL*
are
abroad
,
they
will
surely
be
found
skirting
the
column
,
where
scalps
*NL*
abound
the
most
.
The
route
of
the
detachment
is
known
,
while
ours
,
*NL*
having
been
determined
within
the
hour
,
must
still
be
secret
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Should
we
distrust
the
man
because
his
manners
are
not
our
manners
,
and
*NL*
that
his
skin
is
dark
?
''
coldly
asked
Cora
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alice
hesitated
no
longer
;
but
giving
her
Narrangansett
*
a
smart
cut
*NL*
of
the
whip
,
she
was
the
first
to
dash
aside
the
slight
branches
of
the
*NL*
bushes
,
and
to
follow
the
runner
along
the
dark
and
tangled
pathway
.
*NL*
The
young
man
regarded
the
last
speaker
in
open
admiration
,
and
even
*NL*
permitted
her
fairer
,
though
certainly
not
more
beautiful
companion
,
to
*NL*
proceed
unattended
,
while
he
sedulously
opened
the
way
himself
for
*NL*
the
passage
of
her
who
has
been
called
Cora
.
It
would
seem
that
the
*NL*
domestics
had
been
previously
instructed
;
for
,
instead
of
penetrating
*NL*
the
thicket
,
they
followed
the
route
of
the
column
;
a
measure
which
*NL*
Heyward
stated
had
been
dictated
by
the
sagacity
of
their
guide
,
in
*NL*
order
to
diminish
the
marks
of
their
trail
,
if
,
haply
,
the
Canadian
*NL*
savages
should
be
lurking
so
far
in
advance
of
their
army
.
For
many
*NL*
minutes
the
intricacy
of
the
route
admitted
of
no
further
dialogue
;
*NL*
after
which
they
emerged
from
the
broad
border
of
underbrush
which
*NL*
grew
along
the
line
of
the
highway
,
and
entered
under
the
high
but
dark
*NL*
arches
of
the
forest
.
Here
their
progress
was
less
interrupted
;
and
the
*NL*
instant
the
guide
perceived
that
the
females
could
command
their
steeds
,
*NL*
he
moved
on
,
at
a
pace
between
a
trot
and
a
walk
,
and
at
a
rate
which
*NL*
kept
the
sure-footed
and
peculiar
animals
they
rode
at
a
fast
yet
easy
*NL*
amble
.
The
youth
had
turned
to
speak
to
the
dark-eyed
Cora
,
when
the
*NL*
distant
sound
of
horses
hoofs
,
clattering
over
the
roots
of
the
broken
*NL*
way
in
his
rear
,
caused
him
to
check
his
charger
;
and
,
as
his
companions
*NL*
drew
their
reins
at
the
same
instant
,
the
whole
party
came
to
a
halt
,
in
*NL*
order
to
obtain
an
explanation
of
the
unlooked-for
interruption
.
*NL*
*NL*

In
the
state
of
Rhode
Island
there
is
a
bay
called
*NL*
Narragansett
,
so
named
after
a
powerful
tribe
of
Indians
,
*NL*
which
formerly
dwelt
on
its
banks
.
Accident
,
or
one
of
those
*NL*
unaccountable
freaks
which
nature
sometimes
plays
in
the
*NL*
animal
world
,
gave
rise
to
a
breed
of
horses
which
were
once
*NL*
well
known
in
America
,
and
distinguished
by
their
habit
of
*NL*
pacing
.
Horses
of
this
race
were
,
and
are
still
,
in
much
*NL*
request
as
saddle
horses
,
on
account
of
their
hardiness
and
*NL*
the
ease
of
their
movements
.
As
they
were
also
sure
of
foot
,
*NL*
the
Narragansetts
were
greatly
sought
for
by
females
who
*NL*
were
obliged
to
travel
over
the
roots
and
holes
in
the
``
new
*NL*
countries
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
few
moments
a
colt
was
seen
gliding
,
like
a
fallow
deer
,
among
the
*NL*
straight
trunks
of
the
pines
;
and
,
in
another
instant
,
the
person
of
the
*NL*
ungainly
man
,
described
in
the
preceding
chapter
,
came
into
view
,
with
*NL*
as
much
rapidity
as
he
could
excite
his
meager
beast
to
endure
without
*NL*
coming
to
an
open
rupture
.
Until
now
this
personage
had
escaped
the
*NL*
observation
of
the
travelers
.
If
he
possessed
the
power
to
arrest
any
*NL*
wandering
eye
when
exhibiting
the
glories
of
his
altitude
on
foot
,
his
*NL*
equestrian
graces
were
still
more
likely
to
attract
attention
.
*NL*
*NL*
Notwithstanding
a
constant
application
of
his
one
armed
heel
to
the
*NL*
flanks
of
the
mare
,
the
most
confirmed
gait
that
he
could
establish
*NL*
was
a
Canterbury
gallop
with
the
hind
legs
,
in
which
those
more
forward
*NL*
assisted
for
doubtful
moments
,
though
generally
content
to
maintain
a
*NL*
loping
trot
.
Perhaps
the
rapidity
of
the
changes
from
one
of
these
paces
*NL*
to
the
other
created
an
optical
illusion
,
which
might
thus
magnify
the
*NL*
powers
of
the
beast
;
for
it
is
certain
that
Heyward
,
who
possessed
*NL*
a
true
eye
for
the
merits
of
a
horse
,
was
unable
,
with
his
utmost
*NL*
ingenuity
,
to
decide
by
what
sort
of
movement
his
pursuer
worked
his
*NL*
sinuous
way
on
his
footsteps
with
such
persevering
hardihood
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
industry
and
movements
of
the
rider
were
not
less
remarkable
than
*NL*
those
of
the
ridden
.
At
each
change
in
the
evolutions
of
the
latter
,
*NL*
the
former
raised
his
tall
person
in
the
stirrups
;
producing
,
in
this
*NL*
manner
,
by
the
undue
elongation
of
his
legs
,
such
sudden
growths
and
*NL*
diminishings
of
the
stature
,
as
baffled
every
conjecture
that
might
*NL*
be
made
as
to
his
dimensions
.
If
to
this
be
added
the
fact
that
,
in
*NL*
consequence
of
the
ex
parte
application
of
the
spur
,
one
side
of
the
*NL*
mare
appeared
to
journey
faster
than
the
other
;
and
that
the
aggrieved
*NL*
flank
was
resolutely
indicated
by
unremitted
flourishes
of
a
bushy
tail
,
*NL*
we
finish
the
picture
of
both
horse
and
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
frown
which
had
gathered
around
the
handsome
,
open
,
and
manly
brow
*NL*
of
Heyward
,
gradually
relaxed
,
and
his
lips
curled
into
a
slight
smile
,
*NL*
as
he
regarded
the
stranger
.
Alice
made
no
very
powerful
effort
to
*NL*
control
her
merriment
;
and
even
the
dark
,
thoughtful
eye
of
Cora
lighted
*NL*
with
a
humor
that
it
would
seem
,
the
habit
,
rather
than
the
nature
,
of
*NL*
its
mistress
repressed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Seek
you
any
here
?
''
demanded
Heyward
,
when
the
other
had
arrived
*NL*
sufficiently
nigh
to
abate
his
speed
;
``
I
trust
you
are
no
messenger
of
*NL*
evil
tidings
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Even
so
,
''
replied
the
stranger
,
making
diligent
use
of
his
triangular
*NL*
castor
,
to
produce
a
circulation
in
the
close
air
of
the
woods
,
and
*NL*
leaving
his
hearers
in
doubt
to
which
of
the
young
man
's
questions
he
*NL*
responded
;
when
,
however
,
he
had
cooled
his
face
,
and
recovered
his
*NL*
breath
,
he
continued
,
``
I
hear
you
are
riding
to
William
Henry
;
as
I
*NL*
am
journeying
thitherward
myself
,
I
concluded
good
company
would
seem
*NL*
consistent
to
the
wishes
of
both
parties
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
appear
to
possess
the
privilege
of
a
casting
vote
,
''
returned
*NL*
Heyward
;
``
we
are
three
,
while
you
have
consulted
no
one
but
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Even
so
.
The
first
point
to
be
obtained
is
to
know
one
's
own
mind
.
Once
*NL*
sure
of
that
,
and
where
women
are
concerned
it
is
not
easy
,
the
next
is
,
*NL*
to
act
up
to
the
decision
.
I
have
endeavored
to
do
both
,
and
here
I
am
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
journey
to
the
lake
,
you
have
mistaken
your
route
,
''
said
*NL*
Heyward
,
haughtily
;
``
the
highway
thither
is
at
least
half
a
mile
behind
*NL*
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Even
so
,
''
returned
the
stranger
,
nothing
daunted
by
this
cold
*NL*
reception
;
``
I
have
tarried
at
`
Edward
'
a
week
,
and
I
should
be
dumb
not
*NL*
to
have
inquired
the
road
I
was
to
journey
;
and
if
dumb
there
would
be
*NL*
an
end
to
my
calling
.
''
After
simpering
in
a
small
way
,
like
one
whose
*NL*
modesty
prohibited
a
more
open
expression
of
his
admiration
of
*NL*
a
witticism
that
was
perfectly
unintelligible
to
his
hearers
,
he
*NL*
continued
,
``
It
is
not
prudent
for
any
one
of
my
profession
to
be
too
*NL*
familiar
with
those
he
has
to
instruct
;
for
which
reason
I
follow
not
*NL*
the
line
of
the
army
;
besides
which
,
I
conclude
that
a
gentleman
of
*NL*
your
character
has
the
best
judgment
in
matters
of
wayfaring
;
I
have
,
*NL*
therefore
,
decided
to
join
company
,
in
order
that
the
ride
may
be
made
*NL*
agreeable
,
and
partake
of
social
communion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
most
arbitrary
,
if
not
a
hasty
decision
!
''
exclaimed
Heyward
,
*NL*
undecided
whether
to
give
vent
to
his
growing
anger
,
or
to
laugh
in
the
*NL*
other
's
face
.
``
But
you
speak
of
instruction
,
and
of
a
profession
;
are
*NL*
you
an
adjunct
to
the
provincial
corps
,
as
a
master
of
the
noble
science
*NL*
of
defense
and
offense
;
or
,
perhaps
,
you
are
one
who
draws
lines
and
*NL*
angles
,
under
the
pretense
of
expounding
the
mathematics
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
stranger
regarded
his
interrogator
a
moment
in
wonder
;
and
then
,
*NL*
losing
every
mark
of
self-satisfaction
in
an
expression
of
solemn
*NL*
humility
,
he
answered
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
offense
,
I
hope
there
is
none
,
to
either
party
:
of
defense

I
make
*NL*
none

by
God
's
good
mercy
,
having
committed
no
palpable
sin

entreating
his
pardoning
grace

I
leave
expounding
to
those
who
have
been
called
*NL*

set
apart
for
that
holy
office

I
lay
claim
to
no
higher
gift
than
a
*NL*
small
insight
into
the
glorious
art
of
petitioning
and
thanksgiving
,

*NL*
practiced
in
psalmody

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
man

most
manifestly

a

cried
the
amused
*NL*
Alice
,
``

I
take
him
under
my

*NL*
aside
that
frown

Heyward

in
pity

my
longing
ears

suffer
him
to

journey
in

Besides

''
she
added
,
in
a
low
and
hurried
voice
,
*NL*
casting
a
glance
at
the
distant
Cora
,
who
slowly
followed
the
footsteps
*NL*
of
their
silent
,
but
sullen
guide
,
``

may
be
a

music
in

not
churlishly
reject

*NL*
She
pointed
persuasively
along
the
path
with
her
riding
whip
,
while
*NL*
their
eyes
met
in
a
look
which
the
young
man
lingered
a
moment
to
*NL*
prolong
;
then
,
yielding
to
her
gentle
influence
,
he
clapped
his
spurs
*NL*
into
his
charger
,
and
in
a
few
bounds
was
again
at
the
side
of
Cora
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
glad
to
encounter
thee

continued
the
maiden
,
waving
her
*NL*
hand
to
the
stranger
to
proceed
,
as
she
urged
her
Narragansett
to
renew
*NL*
its
amble
.
``
Partial
relatives
have
almost
persuaded
me
that
I
am
not

entirely
worthless
in
a
duet
myself
;

we
may
enliven
our
wayfaring
*NL*
by
indulging
in
our
favorite
pursuit
.
It
might
be
of
signal
advantage
to
*NL*
one
,
ignorant
as
I
,
to
hear
the
opinions

experience
of
a
master
in

the
art

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
refreshing
both
to
the
spirits

body

indulge

in
psalmody

befitting
seasons

''
returned
the
master
of
song
,
*NL*
unhesitatingly
complying
with
her
intimation
to
follow
;
``
and
nothing
*NL*
would
relieve
the
mind
more
than
such
a
consoling
communion

But
four

necessary

the
perfection

Yon
officer

his
company

fill
the

*NL*
``

not

rashly

smiling
;

assume

*NL*
``
Is

demanded
her

simple
companion

*NL*
Alice
felt
disposed
to
laugh

though
she
succeeded
in
suppressing
her

merriment

ere
she
answered
:
*NL*
*NL*
``

apprehend

addicted

given

I
am
thankful
that

During
this
eulogium
on
the
rare
production
of
his
native
poets

the
*NL*
stranger
had
drawn
the
book
from
his

fitting
a

of

iron-rimmed
spectacles

opened

veneration

Then

without

first
pronounced
the
word

Standish

placing

already
described

to
his
mouth

he
drew
a

high

sound

followed
by
an
octave
below

from
his

he

and
*NL*
melodious
tones
,
that
set
the
music
,
the
poetry
,
and
even
the
uneasy
*NL*
motion
of
his
ill-trained
beast
at
defiance
;
``
How
good
it
is
,
O
see
,
And
*NL*
how
it
pleaseth
well
,
Together
e
`
en
in
unity
,
For
brethren
so
to
dwell
.
*NL*
It
's
like
the
choice
ointment
,
From
the
head
to
the
beard
did
go
;
Down
*NL*
Aaron
's
head
,
that
downward
went
His
garment
's
skirts
unto
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
delivery
of
these
skillful
rhymes
was
accompanied
,
on
the
part
*NL*
of
the
stranger
,
by
a
regular
rise
and
fall
of
his
right
hand
,
which
*NL*
terminated
at
the
descent
,
by
suffering
the
fingers
to
dwell
a
moment
on
*NL*
the
leaves
of
the
little
volume
;
and
on
the
ascent
,
by
such
a
flourish
*NL*
of
the
member
as
none
but
the
initiated
may
ever
hope
to
imitate
.
*NL*
It
would
seem
long
practice
had
rendered
this
manual
accompaniment
*NL*
necessary
;
for
it
did
not
cease
until
the
preposition
which
the
poet
had
*NL*
selected
for
the
close
of
his
verse
had
been
duly
delivered
like
a
word
*NL*
of
two
syllables
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
an
innovation
on
the
silence
and
retirement
of
the
forest
could
not
*NL*
fail
to
enlist
the
ears
of
those
who
journeyed
at
so
short
a
distance
in
*NL*
advance
.
The
Indian
muttered
a
few
words
in
broken
English
to
Heyward
,
*NL*
who
,
in
his
turn
,
spoke
to
the
stranger
;
at
once
interrupting
,
and
,
for
*NL*
the
time
,
closing
his
musical
efforts
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Though
we
are
not
in
danger
,
common
prudence
would
teach
us
to
journey
*NL*
through
this
wilderness
in
as
quiet
a
manner
as
possible
.
You
will
then
,
*NL*
pardon
me
,
Alice
,
should
I
diminish
your
enjoyments
,
by
requesting
this
*NL*
gentleman
to
postpone
his
chant
until
a
safer
opportunity
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
diminish
them
,
indeed
,
''
returned
the
arch
girl
;
``
for
never
did
*NL*
I
hear
a
more
unworthy
conjunction
of
execution
and
language
than
that
*NL*
to
which
I
have
been
listening
;
and
I
was
far
gone
in
a
learned
inquiry
*NL*
into
the
causes
of
such
an
unfitness
between
sound
and
sense
,
when
you
*NL*
broke
the
charm
of
my
musings
by
that
bass
of
yours
,
Duncan
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
not
what
you
call
my
bass
,
''
said
Heyward
,
piqued
at
her
remark
,
*NL*
``
but
I
know
that
your
safety
,
and
that
of
Cora
,
is
far
dearer
to
me
than
*NL*
could
be
any
orchestra
of
Handel
's
music
.
''
He
paused
and
turned
his
head
*NL*
quickly
toward
a
thicket
,
and
then
bent
his
eyes
suspiciously
on
their
*NL*
guide
,
who
continued
his
steady
pace
,
in
undisturbed
gravity
.
The
young
*NL*
man
smiled
to
himself
,
for
he
believed
he
had
mistaken
some
shining
*NL*
berry
of
the
woods
for
the
glistening
eyeballs
of
a
prowling
savage
,
and
*NL*
he
rode
forward
,
continuing
the
conversation
which
had
been
interrupted
*NL*
by
the
passing
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
Major
Heyward
was
mistaken
only
in
suffering
his
youthful
and
generous
*NL*
pride
to
suppress
his
active
watchfulness
.
The
cavalcade
had
not
long
*NL*
passed
,
before
the
branches
of
the
bushes
that
formed
the
thicket
were
*NL*
cautiously
moved
asunder
,
and
a
human
visage
,
as
fiercely
wild
as
savage
*NL*
art
and
unbridled
passions
could
make
it
,
peered
out
on
the
retiring
*NL*
footsteps
of
the
travelers
.
A
gleam
of
exultation
shot
across
the
*NL*
darkly-painted
lineaments
of
the
inhabitant
of
the
forest
,
as
he
traced
*NL*
the
route
of
his
intended
victims
,
who
rode
unconsciously
onward
,
the
*NL*
light
and
graceful
forms
of
the
females
waving
among
the
trees
,
in
the
*NL*
curvatures
of
their
path
,
followed
at
each
bend
by
the
manly
figure
of
*NL*
Heyward
,
until
,
finally
,
the
shapeless
person
of
the
singing
master
*NL*
was
concealed
behind
the
numberless
trunks
of
trees
,
that
rose
,
in
dark
*NL*
lines
,
in
the
intermediate
space
.

*NL*
Leaving
the
unsuspecting
Heyward
and
his
confiding
companions
to
*NL*
penetrate
still
deeper
into
a
forest
that
contained
such
treacherous
*NL*
inmates
,
we
must
use
an
author
's
privilege
,
and
shift
the
scene
a
few
*NL*
miles
to
the
westward
of
the
place
where
we
have
last
seen
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
that
day
,
two
men
were
lingering
on
the
banks
of
a
small
but
rapid
*NL*
stream
,
within
an
hour
's
journey
of
the
encampment
of
Webb
,
like
those
*NL*
who
awaited
the
appearance
of
an
absent
person
,
or
the
approach
of
some
*NL*
expected
event
.
The
vast
canopy
of
woods
spread
itself
to
the
margin
of
*NL*
the
river
,
overhanging
the
water
,
and
shadowing
its
dark
current
with
a
*NL*
deeper
hue
.
The
rays
of
the
sun
were
beginning
to
grow
less
fierce
,
and
*NL*
the
intense
heat
of
the
day
was
lessened
,
as
the
cooler
vapors
of
the
*NL*
springs
and
fountains
rose
above
their
leafy
beds
,
and
rested
in
*NL*
the
atmosphere
.
Still
that
breathing
silence
,
which
marks
the
drowsy
*NL*
sultriness
of
an
American
landscape
in
July
,
pervaded
the
secluded
spot
,
*NL*
interrupted
only
by
the
low
voices
of
the
men
,
the
occasional
and
lazy
*NL*
tap
of
a
woodpecker
,
the
discordant
cry
of
some
gaudy
jay
,
or
a
swelling
*NL*
on
the
ear
,
from
the
dull
roar
of
a
distant
waterfall
.
These
feeble
and
*NL*
broken
sounds
were
,
however
,
too
familiar
to
the
foresters
to
draw
their
*NL*
attention
from
the
more
interesting
matter
of
their
dialogue
.
While
*NL*
one
of
these
loiterers
showed
the
red
skin
and
wild
accouterments
of
a
*NL*
native
of
the
woods
,
the
other
exhibited
,
through
the
mask
of
his
*NL*
rude
and
nearly
savage
equipments
,
the
brighter
,
though
sun-burned
and
*NL*
long-faced
complexion
of
one
who
might
claim
descent
from
a
European
*NL*
parentage
.
The
former
was
seated
on
the
end
of
a
mossy
log
,
in
a
posture
*NL*
that
permitted
him
to
heighten
the
effect
of
his
earnest
language
,
by
*NL*
the
calm
but
expressive
gestures
of
an
Indian
engaged
in
debate
.
His
*NL*
body
,
which
was
nearly
naked
,
presented
a
terrific
emblem
of
death
,
*NL*
drawn
in
intermingled
colors
of
white
and
black
.
His
closely-shaved
*NL*
head
,
on
which
no
other
hair
than
the
well-known
and
chivalrous
*NL*
scalping
tuft
*
was
preserved
,
was
without
ornament
of
any
kind
,
with
*NL*
the
exception
of
a
solitary
eagle
's
plume
,
that
crossed
his
crown
,
*NL*
and
depended
over
the
left
shoulder
.
A
tomahawk
and
scalping
knife
,
of
*NL*
English
manufacture
,
were
in
his
girdle
;
while
a
short
military
rifle
,
*NL*
of
that
sort
with
which
the
policy
of
the
whites
armed
their
savage
*NL*
allies
,
lay
carelessly
across
his
bare
and
sinewy
knee
.
The
expanded
*NL*
chest
,
full
formed
limbs
,
and
grave
countenance
of
this
warrior
,
would
*NL*
denote
that
he
had
reached
the
vigor
of
his
days
,
though
no
symptoms
of
*NL*
decay
appeared
to
have
yet
weakened
his
manhood
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
The
North
American
warrior
caused
the
hair
to
be
plucked
*NL*
from
his
whole
body
;
a
small
tuft
was
left
on
the
crown
of
*NL*
his
head
,
in
order
that
his
enemy
might
avail
himself
of
it
,
*NL*
in
wrenching
off
the
scalp
in
the
event
of
his
fall
.
The
*NL*
scalp
was
the
only
admissible
trophy
of
victory
.
Thus
,
it
*NL*
was
deemed
more
important
to
obtain
the
scalp
than
to
kill
*NL*
the
man
.
Some
tribes
lay
great
stress
on
the
honor
of
*NL*
striking
a
dead
body
.
These
practices
have
nearly
*NL*
disappeared
among
the
Indians
of
the
Atlantic
states
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
frame
of
the
white
man
,
judging
by
such
parts
as
were
not
concealed
*NL*
by
his
clothes
,
was
like
that
of
one
who
had
known
hardships
and
*NL*
exertion
from
his
earliest
youth
.
His
person
,
though
muscular
,
was
*NL*
rather
attenuated
than
full
;
but
every
nerve
and
muscle
appeared
strung
*NL*
and
indurated
by
unremitted
exposure
and
toil
.
He
wore
a
hunting
shirt
*NL*
of
forest-green
,
fringed
with
faded
yellow
*
,
and
a
summer
cap
of
skins
*NL*
which
had
been
shorn
of
their
fur
.
He
also
bore
a
knife
in
a
girdle
of
*NL*
wampum
,
like
that
which
confined
the
scanty
garments
of
the
Indian
,
but
*NL*
no
tomahawk
.
His
moccasins
were
ornamented
after
the
gay
fashion
of
the
*NL*
natives
,
while
the
only
part
of
his
under
dress
which
appeared
below
the
*NL*
hunting-frock
was
a
pair
of
buckskin
leggings
,
that
laced
at
the
sides
,
*NL*
and
which
were
gartered
above
the
knees
,
with
the
sinews
of
a
deer
.
A
*NL*
pouch
and
horn
completed
his
personal
accouterments
,
though
a
rifle
of
*NL*
great
length
**
,
which
the
theory
of
the
more
ingenious
whites
had
*NL*
taught
them
was
the
most
dangerous
of
all
firearms
,
leaned
against
a
*NL*
neighboring
sapling
.
The
eye
of
the
hunter
,
or
scout
,
whichever
he
might
*NL*
be
,
was
small
,
quick
,
keen
,
and
restless
,
roving
while
he
spoke
,
on
*NL*
every
side
of
him
,
as
if
in
quest
of
game
,
or
distrusting
the
sudden
*NL*
approach
of
some
lurking
enemy
.
Notwithstanding
the
symptoms
of
habitual
*NL*
suspicion
,
his
countenance
was
not
only
without
guile
,
but
at
the
moment
*NL*
at
which
he
is
introduced
,
it
was
charged
with
an
expression
of
sturdy
*NL*
honesty
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
The
hunting-shirt
is
a
picturesque
smock-frock
,
being
*NL*
shorter
,
and
ornamented
with
fringes
and
tassels
.
The
colors
*NL*
are
intended
to
imitate
the
hues
of
the
wood
,
with
a
view
to
*NL*
concealment
.
Many
corps
of
American
riflemen
have
been
thus
*NL*
attired
,
and
the
dress
is
one
of
the
most
striking
of
modern
*NL*
times
.
The
hunting-shirt
is
frequently
white
.
*NL*
*NL*
**
The
rifle
of
the
army
is
short
;
that
of
the
hunter
is
*NL*
always
long
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Even
your
traditions
make
the
case
in
my
favor
,
Chingachgook
,
''
he
said
,
*NL*
speaking
in
the
tongue
which
was
known
to
all
the
natives
who
formerly
*NL*
inhabited
the
country
between
the
Hudson
and
the
Potomac
,
and
of
*NL*
which
we
shall
give
a
free
translation
for
the
benefit
of
the
reader
;
*NL*
endeavoring
,
at
the
same
time
,
to
preserve
some
of
the
peculiarities
,
*NL*
both
of
the
individual
and
of
the
language
.
``
Your
fathers
came
from
the
*NL*
setting
sun
,
crossed
the
big
river
*
,
fought
the
people
of
the
country
,
*NL*
and
took
the
land
;
and
mine
came
from
the
red
sky
of
the
morning
,
over
*NL*
the
salt
lake
,
and
did
their
work
much
after
the
fashion
that
had
been
*NL*
set
them
by
yours
;
then
let
God
judge
the
matter
between
us
,
and
friends
*NL*
spare
their
words

''

*NL*
*
The
Mississippi
.
The
scout
alludes
to
a
tradition
which
is
*NL*
very
popular
among
the
tribes
of
the
Atlantic
states
.
*NL*
Evidence
of
their
Asiatic
origin
is
deduced
from
the
*NL*
circumstances
,
though
great
uncertainty
hangs
over
the
whole
*NL*
history
of
the
Indians
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
fathers
fought
with
the
naked
red
man
!
''
returned
the
Indian
,
*NL*
sternly
,
in
the
same
language
.
``
Is
there
no
difference
,
Hawkeye
,
between
*NL*
the
stone-headed
arrow
of
the
warrior
,
and
the
leaden
bullet
with
which
*NL*
you
kill
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
reason
in
an
Indian
,
though
nature
has
made
him
with
a
red
*NL*
skin
!
''
said
the
white
man
,
shaking
his
head
like
one
on
whom
such
an
*NL*
appeal
to
his
justice
was
not
thrown
away
.
For
a
moment
he
appeared
to
*NL*
be
conscious
of
having
the
worst
of
the
argument
,
then
,
rallying
again
,
*NL*
he
answered
the
objection
of
his
antagonist
in
the
best
manner
his
*NL*
limited
information
would
allow
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
no
scholar
,
and
I
care
not
who
knows
it
;
but
,
judging
from
what
*NL*
I
have
seen
,
at
deer
chases
and
squirrel
hunts
,
of
the
sparks
below
,
*NL*
I
should
think
a
rifle
in
the
hands
of
their
grandfathers
was
not
so
*NL*
dangerous
as
a
hickory
bow
and
a
good
flint-head
might
be
,
if
drawn
with
*NL*
Indian
judgment
,
and
sent
by
an
Indian
eye
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
the
story
told
by
your
fathers
,
''
returned
the
other
,
coldly
*NL*
waving
his
hand
.
``
What
say

old
men

Do
they
tell

stone
hatchet

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
a

one
who
vaunts
himself
on

natural

privileges

worst
enemy
I

,
and
he
is

*NL*
Iroquois

dare

deny
that

''
the
scout
replied
,
*NL*
surveying
,
with
secret
satisfaction
,
the
faded
color
of
his
bony
and
*NL*
sinewy
hand
,
``
and
I
am
willing
to
own
that
my
people
have
many
ways

of

which
,
as
an
honest
man
,
I
ca
n't
approve

It
is
one
of
their
customs
to
*NL*
write
in
books
what
they
have
done
and
seen
,
instead
of
telling
them

where
the
lie

be
given
to
the
face
of
a
cowardly

the
brave

call
on
his

bad
fashion

is
too
conscientious
to
misspend
his
days
among
the
women
,
in
learning
*NL*
the
names
of
black
marks
,
may
never
hear
of
the
deeds
of
his
fathers
,
*NL*
nor
feel
a
pride
in
striving
to
outdo
them
.
For
myself
,
I
conclude
the
*NL*
Bumppos
could
shoot
,
for
I
have
a
natural
turn
with
a
rifle
,
which
*NL*
must
have
been
handed
down
from
generation
to
generation
,
as
,
our
holy
*NL*
commandments
tell
us
,
all
good
and
evil
gifts
are
bestowed
;
though
I
*NL*
should
be
loath
to
answer
for
other
people
in
such
a
matter
.
But
every
*NL*
story
has
its
two
sides
;
so
I
ask
you
,
Chingachgook
,
what
passed
,
*NL*
according
to
the
traditions
of
the
red
men
,
when
our
fathers
first
met
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
silence
of
a
minute
succeeded
,
during
which
the
Indian
sat
mute
;
then
,
*NL*
full
of
the
dignity
of
his
office
,
he
commenced
his
brief
tale
,
with
a
*NL*
solemnity
that
served
to
heighten
its
appearance
of
truth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
,
Hawkeye
,
and
your
ear
shall
drink
no
lie
.
'T
is
what
my
fathers
*NL*
have
said
,
and
what
the
Mohicans
have
done
.
''
He
hesitated
a
single
*NL*
instant
,
and
bending
a
cautious
glance
toward
his
companion
,
he
*NL*
continued
,
in
a
manner
that
was
divided
between
interrogation
and
*NL*
assertion
.
``
Does
not
this
stream
at
our
feet
run
toward
the
summer
,
*NL*
until
its
waters
grow
salt
,
and
the
current
flows
upward
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
ca
n't
be
denied
that
your
traditions
tell
you
true
in
both
these
*NL*
matters
,
''
said
the
white
man
;
``
for
I
have
been
there
,
and
have
seen
*NL*
them
,
though
why
water
,
which
is
so
sweet
in
the
shade
,
should
become
*NL*
bitter
in
the
sun
,
is
an
alteration
for
which
I
have
never
been
able
to
*NL*
account
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
the
current
!
''
demanded
the
Indian
,
who
expected
his
reply
with
that
*NL*
sort
of
interest
that
a
man
feels
in
the
confirmation
of
testimony
,
at
*NL*
which
he
marvels
even
while
he
respects
it
;
``
the
fathers
of
Chingachgook
*NL*
have
not
lied
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
holy
Bible
is
not
more
true
,
and
that
is
the
truest
thing
in
*NL*
nature
.
They
call
this
up-stream
current
the
tide
,
which
is
a
thing
soon
*NL*
explained
,
and
clear
enough
.
Six
hours
the
waters
run
in
,
and
six
hours
*NL*
they
run
out
,
and
the
reason
is
this
:
when
there
is
higher
water
in
the
*NL*
sea
than
in
the
river
,
they
run
in
until
the
river
gets
to
be
highest
,
*NL*
and
then
it
runs
out
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
waters
in
the
woods
,
and
on
the
great
lakes
,
run
downward
*NL*
until
they
lie
like
my
hand
,
''
said
the
Indian
,
stretching
the
limb
*NL*
horizontally
before
him
,
``
and
then
they
run
no
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
honest
man
will
deny
it
,
''
said
the
scout
,
a
little
nettled
at
the
*NL*
implied
distrust
of
his
explanation
of
the
mystery
of
the
tides
;
``
and
I
*NL*
grant
that
it
is
true
on
the
small
scale
,
and
where
the
land
is
level
.
*NL*
But
everything
depends
on
what
scale
you
look
at
things
.
Now
,
on
the
*NL*
small
scale
,
the
`
arth
is
level
;
but
on
the
large
scale
it
is
round
.
In
*NL*
this
manner
,
pools
and
ponds
,
and
even
the
great
fresh-water
lakes
,
may
*NL*
be
stagnant
,
as
you
and
I
both
know
they
are
,
having
seen
them
;
but
when
*NL*
you
come
to
spread
water
over
a
great
tract
,
like
the
sea
,
where
the
*NL*
earth
is
round
,
how
in
reason
can
the
water
be
quiet
?
You
might
as
well
*NL*
expect
the
river
to
lie
still
on
the
brink
of
those
black
rocks
a
mile
*NL*
above
us
,
though
your
own
ears
tell
you
that
it
is
tumbling
over
them
at
*NL*
this
very
moment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
If
unsatisfied
by
the
philosophy
of
his
companion
,
the
Indian
was
far
*NL*
too
dignified
to
betray
his
unbelief
.
He
listened
like
one
who
was
*NL*
convinced
,
and
resumed
his
narrative
in
his
former
solemn
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
came
from
the
place
where
the
sun
is
hid
at
night
,
over
great
plains
*NL*
where
the
buffaloes
live
,
until
we
reached
the
big
river
.
There
we
*NL*
fought
the
Alligewi
,
till
the
ground
was
red
with
their
blood
.
From
the
*NL*
banks
of
the
big
river
to
the
shores
of
the
salt
lake
,
there
was
none
to
*NL*
meet
us
.
The
Maquas
followed
at
a
distance
.
We
said
the
country
should
*NL*
be
ours
from
the
place
where
the
water
runs
up
no
longer
on
this
stream
,
*NL*
to
a
river
twenty
sun
's
journey
toward
the
summer
.
We
drove
the
Maquas
*NL*
into
the
woods
with
the
bears
.
They
only
tasted
salt
at
the
licks
;
they
*NL*
drew
no
fish
from
the
great
lake
;
we
threw
them
the
bones

*NL*
*NL*
``
All
this
I
have
heard

believe

''
said
the
white
man
,
observing
that
*NL*
the
Indian
paused
;
``
but
it
was
long
before
the
English
came
into
the
*NL*
country

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
pine
grew
then
where
this
chestnut
now
stands

The
first
pale
faces
*NL*
who
came
among
us
spoke
no
English
.
They
came
in
a
large
canoe
,
when
*NL*
my
fathers
had
buried
the
tomahawk
with
the
red
men
around
them
.
Then
,
*NL*
Hawkeye
,
''
he
continued
,
betraying
his
deep
emotion
,
only
by
permitting
*NL*
his
voice
to
fall
to
those
low
,
guttural
tones
,
which
render
his
*NL*
language
,
as
spoken
at
times
,
so
very
musical
;
``
then
,
Hawkeye
,
we
were
*NL*
one
people
,
and
we
were
happy
.
The
salt
lake
gave
us
its
fish
,
the
wood
*NL*
its
deer
,
and
the
air
its
birds
.
We
took
wives
who
bore
us
children
;
we
*NL*
worshipped
the
Great
Spirit
;
and
we
kept
the
Maquas
beyond
the
sound
of
*NL*
our
songs
of
triumph
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Know
you
anything
of
your
own
family
at
that
time
?
''
demanded
the
white
.
*NL*
``
But
you
are
just
a
man
,
for
an
Indian
;
and
as
I
suppose
you
hold
their
*NL*
gifts

your
fathers
must
have
been
brave
warriors

wise
men
at
the
*NL*
council-fire

*NL*
*NL*
``
My
tribe

the

I
am
an
unmixed
man

The
*NL*
blood
of
chiefs
is
in
my
veins
,
where
it
must
stay
forever
.
The
Dutch
*NL*
landed
,
and
gave
my
people
the
fire-water
;
they
drank
until
the
heavens
*NL*
and
the
earth
seemed
to
meet
,
and
they
foolishly
thought
they
had
found
*NL*
the
Great
Spirit

Then
they
parted
with
their
land

Foot
by
foot

were
driven

*NL*
*NL*
``

bring
solemn
feelings

returned
the
scout
,
a
good
*NL*
deal
touched
at
the
calm
suffering
of
his
companion
;
``

they
often
aid

a
man

his

I
expect

leave
my
*NL*
own
bones
unburied

to
bleach
in
the
woods
,
or
to
be
torn
asunder
by
the
*NL*
wolves

But
where
are
to
be
found
those
of
your
race
who
came
to
their
*NL*
kin
in
the
Delaware
country
,
so
many

*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
are
the
blossoms

those
summers

so
all

of
my

departed
,
each
in
his
turn
,
to
the
land
of
spirits

I
am
on
*NL*
the
hilltop
and
must
go
down
into
the
valley
;
and
when
Uncas
follows
in
*NL*
my
footsteps
there
will
no
longer
be
any
of
the
blood
of
the
Sagamores
,
*NL*
for
my
boy
is
the
last
of
the
Mohicans
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Uncas
is
here
,
''
said
another
voice
,
in
the
same
soft
,
guttural
tones
,
*NL*
near
his
elbow
;
``
who
speaks
to
Uncas
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
white
man
loosened
his
knife
in
his
leathern
sheath
,
and
made
*NL*
an
involuntary
movement
of
the
hand
toward
his
rifle
,
at
this
sudden
*NL*
interruption
;
but
the
Indian
sat
composed
,
and
without
turning
his
head
*NL*
at
the
unexpected
sounds
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
next
instant
,
a
youthful
warrior
passed
between
them
,
with
a
*NL*
noiseless
step
,
and
seated
himself
on
the
bank
of
the
rapid
stream
.
No
*NL*
exclamation
of
surprise
escaped
the
father
,
nor
was
any
question
asked
,
*NL*
or
reply
given
,
for
several
minutes
;
each
appearing
to
await
the
moment
*NL*
when
he
might
speak
,
without
betraying
womanish
curiosity
or
childish
*NL*
impatience
.
The
white
man
seemed
to
take
counsel
from
their
customs
,
*NL*
and
,
relinquishing
his
grasp
of
the
rifle
,
he
also
remained
silent
and
*NL*
reserved
.
At
length
Chingachgook
turned
his
eyes
slowly
toward
his
son
,
*NL*
and
demanded
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
the
Maquas
dare
to
leave
the
print
of
their
moccasins
in
these
*NL*
woods
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
been
on
their
trail
,
''
replied
the
young
Indian
,
``
and
know
that
*NL*
they
number
as
many
as
the
fingers
of
my
two
hands

like
cowards

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The

said
the
white
man

*NL*
whom
we
shall
call
Hawkeye
,
after
the
manner
of
his
companions
.
``
That

busy
Frenchman

know

*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
enough

returned
the
father
,
glancing
his
eye
toward
the
setting
*NL*
sun
;
``
they
shall
be
driven

necessary

find

hill

he
continued
,
in
a
half
whisper
,
and
laughing
with
a
*NL*
kind
of
inward
sound
,
like
one
who
had
learned
to
be
watchful
,
``
I
will
*NL*
bet
my
charger
three
times
full
of
powder

against

foot

take
him
atwixt
the
eyes

nearer
to

right

the
*NL*
left

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
can
not
be

said
the
young
Indian
,
springing
to
his
feet
with
*NL*
youthful
eagerness
;
``
all
but
the
tips
of
his
horns
are
hid
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
a
boy

said
the
white
man
,
shaking
his
head
while
he
spoke
,
and
*NL*
addressing
the
father
.
``
Does
he
think
when
a
hunter
sees
a
part

*NL*
creature

he
ca
n't
tell
where
the
rest
of
him
should
be
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Adjusting
his
rifle
,
he
was
about
to
make
an
exhibition
of
that
skill
*NL*
on
which
he
so
much
valued
himself
,
when
the
warrior
struck
up
the
piece
*NL*
with
his
hand
,
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hawkeye
!
will
you
fight
the
Maquas
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
These
Indians
know
the
nature
of
the
woods

as
it
might
be
by
*NL*
instinct

returned
the
scout
,
dropping
his
rifle
,
and
turning
away
like
*NL*
a
man
who
was
convinced
of
his
error
.
``
I
must
leave
the
buck
to
your
*NL*
arrow

Uncas
,
or
we
may
kill
a
deer
for
them
thieves
,
the
Iroquois
,
to
*NL*
eat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
instant
the
father
seconded
this
intimation
by
an
expressive
gesture
*NL*
of
the
hand
,
Uncas
threw
himself
on
the
ground
,
and
approached
the
*NL*
animal
with
wary
movements
.
When
within
a
few
yards
of
the
cover
,
he
*NL*
fitted
an
arrow
to
his
bow
with
the
utmost
care
,
while
the
antlers
*NL*
moved
,
as
if
their
owner
snuffed
an
enemy
in
the
tainted
air
.
In
another
*NL*
moment
the
twang
of
the
cord
was
heard
,
a
white
streak
was
seen
glancing
*NL*
into
the
bushes
,
and
the
wounded
buck
plunged
from
the
cover
,
to
the
*NL*
very
feet
of
his
hidden
enemy
.
Avoiding
the
horns
of
the
infuriated
*NL*
animal
,
Uncas
darted
to
his
side
,
and
passed
his
knife
across
the
*NL*
throat
,
when
bounding
to
the
edge
of
the
river
it
fell
,
dyeing
the
*NL*
waters
with
its
blood
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
was
done
with
Indian
skill
,
''
said
the
scout
laughing
inwardly
,
but
*NL*
with
vast
satisfaction
;
``
and
't
was
a
pretty
sight
to
behold
!
Though
an
*NL*
arrow
is
a
near
shot

needs
a
knife
to
finish
the
work

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hugh

ejaculated
his
companion
,
turning
quickly
,
like
a
hound
who
*NL*
scented
game
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
the
Lord
,
there
is
a
drove
of

exclaimed
the
scout
,
whose
eyes
*NL*
began
to
glisten
with
the
ardor
of
his
usual
occupation
;
``

he
is

said
the
Indian
,
bending
his
*NL*
body
till
his
ear
nearly
touched
the
earth
.
``
I
hear
the
sounds
of
feet
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
the
wolves
have
driven
the
buck
to
shelter

are
following

on

trail

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

The
horses
of

men
are
coming

returned
the
other
,
raising
*NL*
himself
with
dignity
,
and
resuming
his
seat
on
the
log
with
his
former
*NL*
composure
.
``
Hawkeye
,
they
are
your
brothers
;
speak
to
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
I
will
,
and
in
English
that
the
king
need
n't
be
ashamed
to
*NL*
answer
,
''
returned
the
hunter
,
speaking
in
the
language
of
which
he
*NL*
boasted
;
``
but
I
see
nothing
,
nor
do
I
hear
the
sounds
of
man
or
beast
;
*NL*
't
is
strange
that
an
Indian
should
understand
white
sounds
better
than
a
*NL*
man
who

his
very
enemies
will
own

has
no
cross
in
his
blood

*NL*
he
may
have
lived
with
the
red
skins

enough

be
suspected

Ha
!

there
goes
something
like
the
cracking
of
a
dry
stick

now

hear

the
bushes
move

yes

yes

there
is
a
trampling

I
mistook
for

falls

CHAPTER
4
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
go
thy
way
:
thou
shalt
not
from
this
grove
*NL*
Till
I
torment
thee
for
this
injury

''
--
Midsummer
Night
's
Dream
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
words
were
still
in
the
mouth
of
the
scout
,
when
the
leader
of
the
*NL*
party
,
whose
approaching
footsteps
had
caught
the
vigilant
ear
of
the
*NL*
Indian
,
came
openly
into
view
.
A
beaten
path
,
such
as
those
made
by
the
*NL*
periodical
passage
of
the
deer
,
wound
through
a
little
glen
at
no
great
*NL*
distance
,
and
struck
the
river
at
the
point
where
the
white
man
and
his
*NL*
red
companions
had
posted
themselves
.
Along
this
track
the
travelers
,
*NL*
who
had
produced
a
surprise
so
unusual
in
the
depths
of
the
forest
,
*NL*
advanced
slowly
toward
the
hunter
,
who
was
in
front
of
his
associates
,
*NL*
in
readiness
to
receive
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
comes
?
''
demanded
the
scout
,
throwing
his
rifle
carelessly
across
*NL*
his
left
arm
,
and
keeping
the
forefinger
of
his
right
hand
on
the
*NL*
trigger
,
though
he
avoided
all
appearance
of
menace
in
the
act
.
``
Who
*NL*
comes
hither
,
among
the
beasts
and
dangers
of
the
wilderness
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Believers
in
religion
,
and
friends
to
the
law
and
to
the
king
,
''
*NL*
returned
he
who
rode
foremost
.
``
Men
who
have
journeyed
since
the
rising
*NL*
sun
,
in
the
shades
of
this
forest
,
without
nourishment
,
and
are
sadly
*NL*
tired
of
their
wayfaring
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
,
then
,
lost
,
''
interrupted
the
hunter
,
``
and
have
found
how
*NL*
helpless
't
is
not
to
know
whether
to
take
the
right
hand

the
left
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Even
so
;
sucking
babes
are
not
more
dependent
on
those
who
guide
them
*NL*
than
we
who
are
of
larger
growth
,
and
who
may
now
be
said
to
possess
the
*NL*
stature
without
the
knowledge
of
men
.
Know
you
the
distance
to
a
post
of
*NL*
the
crown
called
William
Henry
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hoot
!
''
shouted
the
scout
,
who
did
not
spare
his
open
laughter
,
though
*NL*
instantly
checking
the
dangerous
sounds
he
indulged
his
merriment
at
*NL*
less
risk
of
being
overheard
by
any
lurking
enemies
.
``
You
are
as
much
*NL*
off
the
scent
as
a
hound
would
be

with
Horican
atwixt
him
and

deer

*NL*
William
Henry
,
man
!
if
you
are
friends
to
the
king
and
have
business
*NL*
with
the
army
,
your
way
would
be
to
follow
the
river
down
to
Edward
,
and
*NL*
lay
the
matter
before
Webb
,
who
tarries
there
,
instead
of
pushing
into
*NL*
the
defiles
,
and
driving
this
saucy
Frenchman
back
across
Champlain
,
*NL*
into
his
den
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Before
the
stranger
could
make
any
reply
to
this
unexpected
proposition
,
*NL*
another
horseman
dashed
the
bushes
aside
,
and
leaped
his
charger
into
*NL*
the
pathway
,
in
front
of
his
companion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
then
,
may
be
our
distance
from
Fort
Edward
?
''
demanded
a
new
*NL*
speaker
;
``
the
place
you
advise
us
to
seek
we
left
this
morning
,
and
our
*NL*
destination
is
the
head
of
the
lake

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
must
have
lost
your
eyesight
afore
losing
your
way
,
for
the
*NL*
road
across
the
portage
is
cut
to
a
good
two
rods
,
and
is
as
grand
a
*NL*
path
,
I
calculate
,
as
any
that
runs
into
London
,
or
even
before
the
*NL*
palace
of
the
king
himself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
will
not
dispute
concerning
the
excellence
of
the
passage
,
''
returned
*NL*
Heyward
,
smiling
;
for
,
as
the
reader
has
anticipated
,
it
was
he
.
``
It
is
*NL*
enough
,
for
the
present
,
that
we
trusted
to
an
Indian
guide
to
take
*NL*
us
by
a
nearer
,
though
blinder
path
,
and
that
we
are
deceived
in
his
*NL*
knowledge
.
In
plain
words
,
we
know
not
where
we
are
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
Indian
lost
in
the
woods
!
''
said
the
scout
,
shaking
his
head
*NL*
doubtingly
;
``
When
the
sun
is
scorching
the
tree
tops
,
and
the
water
*NL*
courses
are
full
;
when
the
moss
on
every
beech
he
sees
will
tell
him
in
*NL*
what
quarter
the
north
star
will
shine
at
night
.
The
woods
are
full
*NL*
of
deer-paths
which
run
to
the
streams
and
licks
,
places
well
known
to
*NL*
everybody
;
nor
have
the
geese
done
their
flight
to
the
Canada
waters
*NL*
altogether
!
'T
is
strange
that
an
Indian
should
be
lost
atwixt
Horican
*NL*
and
the
bend
in
the
river
!
Is
he
a
Mohawk
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
by
birth
,
though
adopted
in
that
tribe
;
I
think
his
birthplace
was
*NL*
farther
north
,
and
he
is
one
of
those
you
call
a
Huron
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hugh
!
''
exclaimed
the
two
companions
of
the
scout
,
who
had
continued
*NL*
until
this
part
of
the
dialogue
,
seated
immovable
,
and
apparently
*NL*
indifferent
to
what
passed
,
but
who
now
sprang
to
their
feet
with
an
*NL*
activity
and
interest
that
had
evidently
got
the
better
of
their
reserve
*NL*
by
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
Huron
!
''
repeated
the
sturdy
scout
,
once
more
shaking
his
head
in
*NL*
open
distrust
;
``
they
are
a
thievish
race
,
nor
do
I
care
by
whom
they
are
*NL*
adopted
;
you
can
never
make
anything
of
them
but
skulks
and
vagabonds
.
*NL*
Since
you
trusted
yourself
to
the
care
of
one
of
that
nation
,
I
only
*NL*
wonder
that
you
have
not
fallen
in
with
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
that
there
is
little
danger
,
since
William
Henry
is
so
many
miles
*NL*
in
our
front
.
You
forget
that
I
have
told
you
our
guide
is
now
a
Mohawk
,
*NL*
and
that
he
serves
with
our
forces
as
a
friend

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
tell
you
that
he
who
is
born
a
Mingo
will
die
a
Mingo

returned
*NL*
the
other
positively
.
``
A
Mohawk
!
No

give
me
a
Delaware

a
Mohican

for
honesty
;
and
when
they
will
fight

they

n't
all
do

cunning
enemies

Maquas

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Enough
of
this
,

said
Heyward
,
impatiently
;
``
I
wish
not
to
inquire
into

the
character

I
know

you
must
be
a
stranger

*NL*
You
have
not
yet
answered
my
question
;
what
is
our
distance
from
the
*NL*
main
army
at
Edward
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
seems
that
may
depend
on
who
is
your
guide
.
One
would
think
such
*NL*
a
horse
as
that
might
get
over
a
good
deal
of
ground
atwixt
sun-up
and
*NL*
sun-down
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
no
contention
of
idle
words
with
you

friend

said
Heyward
,
*NL*
curbing
his
dissatisfied
manner
,
and
speaking
in
a
more
gentle
voice
;
*NL*
``
if
you
will
tell
me
the
distance
to
Fort
Edward
,
and
conduct
me
*NL*
thither
,
your
labor
shall
not
go
without
its
reward

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
in
so
doing
,
how
know
I
that
I
do
n't
guide
an
enemy
and
a
spy
of
*NL*
Montcalm
,
to
the
works
of
the
army

It
is
not
every
man
who
can
speak
*NL*
the
English
tongue
that
is
an
honest
subject

*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
serve
with
the
troops

of
whom
I
judge
you
to
be

scout

a
regiment

Sixtieth

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
``
Well

``

interrupted
the
hunter
,
elevating
his
body
like
one
who
was

proud
of
his
trust
.
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
corps

of
the
junior
of

all

*NL*
*NL*
``

of

provinces
far
south

has
got
the
place

He
is
over
young

too

*NL*
to
hold
such
rank

and
to
be
put
above
men
whose
heads
are
beginning
to

bleach

*NL*
*NL*
The
scout
regarded
Heyward
in
surprise
,
and
then
lifting
his
cap
,
he
*NL*
answered
,
in
a
tone
less
confident
than
before
--
though
still
expressing
*NL*
doubt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
heard
a
party
was
to
leave
the
encampment
this
morning
for
the
*NL*
lake
shore
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
heard
the
truth

I
preferred
a
nearer
route

trusting
to
*NL*
the
knowledge
of
the
Indian
I
mentioned
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
he
deceived
you
,
and
then
deserted
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Neither
,
as
I
believe

certainly
not
the

for
he
is
to
be
found
*NL*
in
the
rear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
like
to
look
at
the
creature
;
if
it
is
a
true
Iroquois
I
*NL*
can
tell
him
by
his
knavish
look
,
and
by
his
paint
,
''
said
the
scout
;
*NL*
stepping
past
the
charger
of
Heyward
,
and
entering
the
path
behind
the
*NL*
mare
of
the
singing
master
,
whose
foal
had
taken
advantage
of
the
halt
*NL*
to
exact
the
maternal
contribution
.
After
shoving
aside
the
bushes
,
*NL*
and
proceeding
a
few
paces
,
he
encountered
the
females
,
who
awaited
*NL*
the
result
of
the
conference
with
anxiety
,
and
not
entirely
without
*NL*
apprehension
.
Behind
these
,
the
runner
leaned
against
a
tree
,
where
he
*NL*
stood
the
close
examination
of
the
scout
with
an
air
unmoved
,
though
*NL*
with
a
look
so
dark
and
savage
,
that
it
might
in
itself
excite
fear
.
*NL*
Satisfied
with
his
scrutiny
,
the
hunter
soon
left
him
.
As
he
repassed
*NL*
the
females
,
he
paused
a
moment
to
gaze
upon
their
beauty
,
answering
to
*NL*
the
smile
and
nod
of
Alice
with
a
look
of
open
pleasure
.
Thence
he
went
*NL*
to
the
side
of
the
motherly
animal
,
and
spending
a
minute
in
a
fruitless
*NL*
inquiry
into
the
character
of
her
rider
,
he
shook
his
head
and
returned
*NL*
to
Heyward
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
Mingo
is
a
Mingo
,
and
God
having
made
him
so
,
neither
the
Mohawks
nor
*NL*
any
other
tribe
can
alter
him

he
said
,
when
he
had
regained
his
former
*NL*
position
.
``
If
we
were
alone
,
and
you
would
leave
that
noble
horse
at
the
*NL*
mercy
of
the
wolves
to-night
,
I
could
show
you
the
way
to
Edward
myself
,
*NL*
within
an
hour
,
for
it
lies
only
about
an
hour
's
journey
hence
;
but
with
*NL*
such
ladies
in
your
company
't
is
impossible
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
why
?
They
are
fatigued

they
are
quite
equal
to
a
ride
of
a
few
*NL*
more
miles

*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
a
natural
impossibility

repeated
the
scout
;

I

*NL*
``
Think

so

said
Heyward

leaning
forward
in
the
saddle
,
and
*NL*
dropping
his
voice
nearly
to
a
whisper
;

confess

conceal
them
,
*NL*
and
affected
a
confidence
I
have
not
always
felt
,
on
account
of
my
*NL*
companions
.
It
was
because
I
suspected
him
that
I
would
follow
no
*NL*
longer
;
making
him
,
as
you
see
,
follow
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
knew
he
was
one
of
the
cheats
as
soon
as
I
laid
eyes
on
him
!
''
*NL*
returned
the
scout
,
placing
a
finger
on
his
nose
,
in
sign
of
caution
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
thief
is
leaning
against
the
foot
of
the
sugar
sapling
,
that
you
*NL*
can
see
over
them
bushes
;
his
right
leg
is
in
a
line
with
the
bark
of
*NL*
the
tree
,
and
,
''
tapping
his
rifle
,
``
I
can
take
him
from
where
I
stand
,
*NL*
between
the
angle
and
the
knee
,
with
a
single
shot
,
putting
an
end
*NL*
to
his
tramping
through
the
woods
,
for
at
least
a
month
to
come
.
If
I
*NL*
should
go
back
to
him
,
the
cunning
varmint
would
suspect
something
,
and
*NL*
be
dodging
through
the
trees
like
a
frightened
deer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
will
not
do
.
He
may
be
innocent
,
and
I
dislike
the
act
.
Though
,
if
I
*NL*
felt
confident
of
his
treachery

''
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
a
safe
thing
to
calculate
on
the
knavery
of
an
Iroquois
,
''
said
the
*NL*
scout
,
throwing
his
rifle
forward
,
by
a
sort
of
instinctive
movement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hold
!
''
interrupted
Heyward
,
``
it
will
not
do
--
we
must
think
of
some
*NL*
other
scheme
--
and
yet
,
I
have
much
reason
to
believe
the
rascal
has
*NL*
deceived
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
hunter
,
who
had
already
abandoned
his
intention
of
maiming
the
*NL*
runner
,
mused
a
moment
,
and
then
made
a
gesture
,
which
instantly
brought
*NL*
his
two
red
companions
to
his
side
.
They
spoke
together
earnestly
in
the
*NL*
Delaware
language
,
though
in
an
undertone
;
and
by
the
gestures
of
*NL*
the
white
man
,
which
were
frequently
directed
towards
the
top
of
the
*NL*
sapling
,
it
was
evident
he
pointed
out
the
situation
of
their
hidden
*NL*
enemy
.
His
companions
were
not
long
in
comprehending
his
wishes
,
and
*NL*
laying
aside
their
firearms
,
they
parted
,
taking
opposite
sides
of
*NL*
the
path
,
and
burying
themselves
in
the
thicket
,
with
such
cautious
*NL*
movements
,
that
their
steps
were
inaudible
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
go
you
back
,
''
said
the
hunter
,
speaking
again
to
Heyward
,
``
and
*NL*
hold
the
imp
in
talk
;
these
Mohicans
here
will
take
him
without
breaking
*NL*
his
paint
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
''
said
Heyward
,
proudly
,
``
I
will
seize
him
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hist
!
what
could
you
do
,
mounted
,
against
an
Indian
in
the
bushes
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
dismount
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
,
think
you
,
when
he
saw
one
of
your
feet
out
of
the
stirrup
,
he
*NL*
would
wait
for
the
other
to
be
free
?
Whoever
comes
into
the
woods
to
*NL*
deal
with
the
natives
,
must
use
Indian
fashions
,
if
he
would
wish
to
*NL*
prosper
in
his
undertakings
.
Go
,
then
;
talk
openly
to
the
miscreant
,
and
*NL*
seem
to
believe
him
the
truest
friend
you
have
on
`
arth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Heyward
prepared
to
comply
,
though
with
strong
disgust
at
the
nature
of
*NL*
the
office
he
was
compelled
to
execute
.
Each
moment
,
however
,
pressed
*NL*
upon
him
a
conviction
of
the
critical
situation
in
which
he
had
suffered
*NL*
his
invaluable
trust
to
be
involved
through
his
own
confidence
.
The
sun
*NL*
had
already
disappeared
,
and
the
woods
,
suddenly
deprived
of
his
light
*
,
*NL*
were
assuming
a
dusky
hue
,
which
keenly
reminded
him
that
the
hour
the
*NL*
savage
usually
chose
for
his
most
barbarous
and
remorseless
acts
*NL*
of
vengeance
or
hostility
,
was
speedily
drawing
near
.
Stimulated
by
*NL*
apprehension
,
he
left
the
scout
,
who
immediately
entered
into
a
loud
*NL*
conversation
with
the
stranger
that
had
so
unceremoniously
enlisted
*NL*
himself
in
the
party
of
travelers
that
morning
.
In
passing
his
gentler
*NL*
companions
Heyward
uttered
a
few
words
of
encouragement
,
and
was
*NL*
pleased
to
find
that
,
though
fatigued
with
the
exercise
of
the
day
,
they
*NL*
appeared
to
entertain
no
suspicion
that
their
present
embarrassment
was
*NL*
other
than
the
result
of
accident
.
Giving
them
reason
to
believe
he
*NL*
was
merely
employed
in
a
consultation
concerning
the
future
route
,
*NL*
he
spurred
his
charger
,
and
drew
the
reins
again
when
the
animal
had
*NL*
carried
him
within
a
few
yards
of
the
place
where
the
sullen
runner
*NL*
still
stood
,
leaning
against
the
tree
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
The
scene
of
this
tale
was
in
the
42d
degree
of
latitude
,
*NL*
where
the
twilight
is
never
of
long
continuation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
see
,
Magua
,
''
he
said
,
endeavoring
to
assume
an
air
of
freedom
*NL*
and
confidence
,
``
that
the
night
is
closing
around
us
,
and
yet
we
are
no
*NL*
nearer
to
William
Henry
than
when
we
left
the
encampment
of
Webb
with
*NL*
the
rising
sun
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
missed
the
way
,
nor
have
I
been
more
fortunate
.
But
,
happily
,
*NL*
we
have
fallen
in
with
a
hunter
,
he
whom
you
hear
talking
to
the
singer
,
*NL*
that
is
acquainted
with
the
deerpaths
and
by-ways
of
the
woods
,
and
*NL*
who
promises
to
lead
us
to
a
place
where
we
may
rest
securely
till
the
*NL*
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Indian
riveted
his
glowing
eyes
on
Heyward
as
he
asked
,
in
his
*NL*
imperfect
English
,
``
Is
he
alone
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alone
!
''
hesitatingly
answered
Heyward
,
to
whom
deception
was
too
new
to
*NL*
be
assumed
without
embarrassment
.
``
Oh
!
not
alone
,
surely
,
Magua
,
for
you
*NL*
know
that
we
are
with
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
Le
Renard
Subtil
will
go
,
''
returned
the
runner
,
coolly
raising
*NL*
his
little
wallet
from
the
place
where
it
had
lain
at
his
feet
;
``
and
the
*NL*
pale
faces
will
see
none
but
their
own
color
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
!
Whom
call
you
Le
Renard
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
the
name
his
Canada
fathers
have
given
to
Magua
,
''
returned
the
*NL*
runner
,
with
an
air
that
manifested
his
pride
at
the
distinction
.
``
Night
*NL*
is
the
same
as
day
to
Le
Subtil
,
when
Munro
waits
for
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
account
will
Le
Renard
give
the
chief
of
William
Henry
*NL*
concerning
his
daughters
?
Will
he
dare
to
tell
the
hot-blooded
Scotsman
*NL*
that
his
children
are
left
without
a
guide
,
though
Magua
promised
to
be
*NL*
one
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Though
the
gray
head
has
a
loud
voice
,
and
a
long
arm
,
Le
Renard
will
*NL*
not
hear
him
,
nor
feel
him
,
in
the
woods
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
will
the
Mohawks
say
?
They
will
make
him
petticoats
,
and
bid
*NL*
him
stay
in
the
wigwam
with
the
women
,
for
he
is
no
longer

be
trusted

business

man

*NL*
*NL*
``
Le
Subtil

path

the
great
lakes

can
find
the
bones

of

,
''
was
the
answer
of
the
unmoved
runner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Enough
,
Magua
,
''
said
Heyward
;
``
are
we
not
friends

Why
should
there
be

bitter
words
between

has
promised
you
a

for

when
performed

I
shall
be
your
debtor
for

Rest
your
weary
*NL*
limbs
,
then
,
and
open
your
wallet
to
eat
.
We
have
a
few
moments
to
*NL*
spare
;
let
us
not
waste
them
in
talk
like
wrangling
women
.
When
the
*NL*
ladies
are
refreshed
we
will
proceed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
pale
faces
make
themselves
dogs
to
their
women
,
''
muttered
the
*NL*
Indian
,
in
his
native
language
,
``
and
when
they
want
to
eat
,
their
*NL*
warriors
must
lay
aside
the
tomahawk
to
feed
their
laziness

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
say
you
,
Renard
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Le
Subtil
says
it
is
good
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Indian
then
fastened
his
eyes
keenly
on
the
open
countenance
of
*NL*
Heyward
,
but
meeting
his
glance
,
he
turned
them
quickly
away
,
and
*NL*
seating
himself
deliberately
on
the
ground
,
he
drew
forth
the
remnant
of
*NL*
some
former
repast
,
and
began
to
eat
,
though
not
without
first
bending
*NL*
his
looks
slowly
and
cautiously
around
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
well
,
''
continued
Heyward
;
``
and
Le
Renard
will
have
strength
and
*NL*
sight
to
find
the
path
in
the
morning
''
;
he
paused
,
for
sounds
like
the
*NL*
snapping
of
a
dried
stick
,
and
the
rustling
of
leaves
,
rose
from
the
*NL*
adjacent
bushes
,
but
recollecting
himself
instantly
,
he
continued
,
``
we
*NL*
must
be
moving
before
the
sun
is
seen
,
or
Montcalm
may
lie
in
our
path
,
*NL*
and
shut
us
out
from
the
fortress
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
hand
of
Magua
dropped
from
his
mouth
to
his
side
,
and
though
*NL*
his
eyes
were
fastened
on
the
ground
,
his
head
was
turned
aside
,
his
*NL*
nostrils
expanded
,
and
his
ears
seemed
even
to
stand
more
erect
than
*NL*
usual
,
giving
to
him
the
appearance
of
a
statue
that
was
made
to
*NL*
represent
intense
attention
.
*NL*
*NL*
Heyward
,
who
watched
his
movements
with
a
vigilant
eye
,
carelessly
*NL*
extricated
one
of
his
feet
from
the
stirrup
,
while
he
passed
a
hand
*NL*
toward
the
bear-skin
covering
of
his
holsters
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
effort
to
detect
the
point
most
regarded
by
the
runner
was
*NL*
completely
frustrated
by
the
tremulous
glances
of
his
organs
,
which
*NL*
seemed
not
to
rest
a
single
instant
on
any
particular
object
,
and
which
,
*NL*
at
the
same
time
,
could
be
hardly
said
to
move
.
While
he
hesitated
how
*NL*
to
proceed
,
Le
Subtil
cautiously
raised
himself
to
his
feet
,
though
with
*NL*
a
motion
so
slow
and
guarded
,
that
not
the
slightest
noise
was
produced
*NL*
by
the
change
.
Heyward
felt
it
had
now
become
incumbent
on
him
to
act
.
*NL*
Throwing
his
leg
over
the
saddle
,
he
dismounted
,
with
a
determination
to
*NL*
advance
and
seize
his
treacherous
companion
,
trusting
the
result
to
his
*NL*
own
manhood
.
In
order
,
however
,
to
prevent
unnecessary
alarm
,
he
still
*NL*
preserved
an
air
of
calmness
and
friendship
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Le
Renard
Subtil
does
not
eat
,
''
he
said
,
using
the
appellation
he
had
*NL*
found
most
flattering
to
the
vanity
of
the
Indian
.
``
His
corn
is
not
*NL*
well
parched
,
and
it
seems
dry
.
Let
me
examine
;
perhaps
something
may
be
*NL*
found
among
my
own
provisions
that
will
help
his
appetite
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Magua
held
out
the
wallet
to
the
proffer
of
the
other
.
He
even
suffered
*NL*
their
hands
to
meet
,
without
betraying
the
least
emotion
,
or
varying
his
*NL*
riveted
attitude
of
attention
.
But
when
he
felt
the
fingers
of
Heyward
*NL*
moving
gently
along
his
own
naked
arm
,
he
struck
up
the
limb
of
the
*NL*
young
man
,
and
,
uttering
a
piercing
cry
,
he
darted
beneath
it
,
and
*NL*
plunged
,
at
a
single
bound
,
into
the
opposite
thicket
.
At
the
next
*NL*
instant
the
form
of
Chingachgook
appeared
from
the
bushes
,
looking
like
*NL*
a
specter
in
its
paint
,
and
glided
across
the
path
in
swift
pursuit
.
*NL*
Next
followed
the
shout
of
Uncas
,
when
the
woods
were
lighted
by
a
*NL*
sudden
flash
,
that
was
accompanied
by
the
sharp
report
of
the
hunter
's
*NL*
rifle
.

``
In
such
a

The
suddenness
of
the
flight
of
his
guide
,
and
the
wild
cries
of
the
*NL*
pursuers
,
caused
Heyward
to
remain
fixed
,
for
a
few
moments
,
in
inactive
*NL*
surprise
.
Then
recollecting
the
importance
of
securing
the
fugitive
,
he
*NL*
dashed
aside
the
surrounding
bushes
,
and
pressed
eagerly
forward
to
lend
*NL*
his
aid
in
the
chase
.
Before
he
had
,
however
,
proceeded
a
hundred
yards
,
*NL*
he
met
the
three
foresters
already
returning
from
their
unsuccessful
*NL*
pursuit
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
so
soon
disheartened
!
''
he
exclaimed
;
``
the
scoundrel
must
be
*NL*
concealed
behind
some
of
these
trees
,
and
may
yet
be
secured

We
are
not
*NL*
safe
while

goes
at
large

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
you
set
a
cloud
to
chase
the
wind
?
''
returned
the
disappointed
*NL*
scout
;
``
I
heard
the
imp
brushing
over
the
dry
leaves
,
like
a
black
*NL*
snake
,
and
blinking
a
glimpse
of
him
,
just
over
ag

yon
big
pine

I
*NL*
pulled
as
it
might
be

scent

for
a

aim

if
anybody

myself
had
touched
the
trigger

I
should
*NL*
call
it
a
quick

I
may
be
accounted
to
have
experience
in

these
matters

and
one
who
ought

know

Look
at

``
No

returned
the
scout
,
in
decided
disapprobation
of
this
opinion
,
*NL*
``
I
rubbed
the
bark

,
but
the
creature
leaped
the
*NL*
longer
for
it
.
A
rifle
bullet
acts
on
a
running
animal
,
when
it
barks
*NL*
him
,
much
the
same
as
one
of
your
spurs
on
a
horse
;
that
is
,
it
quickens
*NL*
motion
,
and
puts
life
into
the
flesh
,
instead
of
taking
it
away
.
But
*NL*
when
it
cuts
the
ragged
hole
,
after
a
bound
or
two
,
there
is
,
commonly
,
*NL*
a
stagnation
of
further
leaping
,
be
it
Indian
or
be
it
deer
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
four
able
bodies
,
to
one
wounded
man
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
life
grievous
to
you
?
''
interrupted
the
scout
.
``
Yonder
red
devil
*NL*
would
draw
you
within
swing
of
the
tomahawks
of
his
comrades
,
before
you
*NL*
were
heated
in
the
chase
.
It
was
an
unthoughtful
act
in
a
man
who
has
so
*NL*
often
slept
with
the
war-whoop
ringing
in
the
air
,
to
let
off
his
piece
*NL*
within
sound
of
an
ambushment
!
But
then
it
was
a
natural
temptation
!
*NL*
't
was
very
natural
!
Come
,
friends
,
let
us
move
our
station
,
and
in
such
*NL*
fashion
,
too
,
as
will
throw
the
cunning
of
a
Mingo
on
a
wrong
scent
,
or
*NL*
our
scalps
will
be
drying
in
the
wind
in
front
of
Montcalm
's
marquee
,
*NL*
ag
`
in
this
hour
to-morrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
appalling
declaration
,
which
the
scout
uttered
with
the
cool
*NL*
assurance
of
a
man
who
fully
comprehended
,
while
he
did
not
fear
to
face
*NL*
the
danger
,
served
to
remind
Heyward
of
the
importance
of
the
charge
*NL*
with
which
he
himself
had
been
intrusted
.
Glancing
his
eyes
around
,
with
*NL*
a
vain
effort
to
pierce
the
gloom
that
was
thickening
beneath
the
*NL*
leafy
arches
of
the
forest
,
he
felt
as
if
,
cut
off
from
human
aid
,
*NL*
his
unresisting
companions
would
soon
lie
at
the
entire
mercy
of
those
*NL*
barbarous
enemies
,
who
,
like
beasts
of
prey
,
only
waited
till
the
*NL*
gathering
darkness
might
render
their
blows
more
fatally
certain
.
His
*NL*
awakened
imagination
,
deluded
by
the
deceptive
light
,
converted
each
*NL*
waving
bush
,
or
the
fragment
of
some
fallen
tree
,
into
human
forms
,
and
*NL*
twenty
times
he
fancied
he
could
distinguish
the
horrid
visages
of
*NL*
his
lurking
foes
,
peering
from
their
hiding
places
,
in
never
ceasing
*NL*
watchfulness
of
the
movements
of
his
party
.
Looking
upward
,
he
found
*NL*
that
the
thin
fleecy
clouds
,
which
evening
had
painted
on
the
blue
*NL*
sky
,
were
already
losing
their
faintest
tints
of
rose-color
,
while
the
*NL*
imbedded
stream
,
which
glided
past
the
spot
where
he
stood
,
was
to
be
*NL*
traced
only
by
the
dark
boundary
of
its
wooded
banks
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
to
be
done
!
''
he
said
,
feeling
the
utter
helplessness
of
doubt
*NL*
in
such
a
pressing
strait
;
``
desert
me
not
,
for
God
's
sake
!
remain
to
*NL*
defend
those
I
escort
,
and
freely
name
your
own
reward
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
companions
,
who
conversed
apart
in
the
language
of
their
tribe
,
*NL*
heeded
not
this
sudden
and
earnest
appeal
.
Though
their
dialogue
was
*NL*
maintained
in
low
and
cautious
sounds
,
but
little
above
a
whisper
,
*NL*
Heyward
,
who
now
approached
,
could
easily
distinguish
the
earnest
tones
*NL*
of
the
younger
warrior
from
the
more
deliberate
speeches
of
his
seniors
.
*NL*
It
was
evident
that
they
debated
on
the
propriety
of
some
measure
,
that
*NL*
nearly
concerned
the
welfare
of
the
travelers
.
Yielding
to
his
powerful
*NL*
interest
in
the
subject
,
and
impatient
of
a
delay
that
seemed
fraught
*NL*
with
so
much
additional
danger
,
Heyward
drew
still
nigher
to
the
dusky
*NL*
group
,
with
an
intention
of
making
his
offers
of
compensation
more
*NL*
definite
,
when
the
white
man
,
motioning
with
his
hand
,
as
if
he
conceded
*NL*
the
disputed
point
,
turned
away
,
saying
in
a
sort
of
soliloquy
,
and
in
*NL*
the
English
tongue
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Uncas
is
right
!
it
would
not
be
the
act
of
men
to
leave
such
harmless
*NL*
things
to
their
fate
,
even
though
it
breaks
up
the
harboring
place
*NL*
forever
.
If
you
would
save
these
tender
blossoms
from
the
fangs
of
*NL*
the
worst
of
serpents
,
gentleman
,
you
have
neither
time
to
lose
nor
*NL*
resolution
to
throw
away
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
such
a
wish
be
doubted
!
Have
I
not
already
offered
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Offer
your
prayers
to
Him
who
can
give
us
wisdom
to
circumvent
the
*NL*
cunning
of
the
devils
who
fill
these
woods
,
''
calmly
interrupted
the
*NL*
scout
,
``
but
spare
your
offers
of
money
,
which
neither
you
may
live
to

These
Mohicans

I
will
do
what

thoughts
can
invent

keep
such
flowers

which
,
though
so
sweet

never
made

the
wilderness

from
harm
,
and
that
without
hope
of
*NL*
any
other
recompense
but
such
as
God
always
gives
to
upright
dealings

*NL*
First
,
you
must
promise
two
things

both
in
your
own

for
your

friends

without
serving
you
we
shall
only
injure
ourselves

*NL*
*NL*
``
Name

*NL*
*NL*
``
The
one
is

to
be
still

secret
from
all
mortal
men

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
do
my
utmost
to
see
both
these
conditions
fulfilled
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
follow
,
for
we
are
losing
moments
that

''
*NL*
*NL*
Heyward
could
distinguish
the
impatient
gesture
of
the
scout
,
through
*NL*
the
increasing
shadows
of
the
evening
,
and
he
moved
in
his
footsteps
,
*NL*
swiftly
,
toward
the
place
where
he
had
left
the
remainder
of
the
*NL*
party
.
When
they
rejoined
the
expecting
and
anxious
females
,
he
briefly
*NL*
acquainted
them
with
the
conditions
of
their
new
guide
,
and
with
the
*NL*
necessity
that
existed
for
their
hushing
every
apprehension
in
instant
*NL*
and
serious
exertions
.
Although
his
alarming
communication
was
not
*NL*
received
without
much
secret
terror
by
the
listeners
,
his
earnest
and
*NL*
impressive
manner
,
aided
perhaps
by
the
nature
of
the
danger
,
succeeded
*NL*
in
bracing
their
nerves
to
undergo
some
unlooked-for
and
unusual
trial
.
*NL*
Silently
,
and
without
a
moment
's
delay
,
they
permitted
him
to
assist
*NL*
them
from
their
saddles
,
and
when
they
descended
quickly
to
the
water
's
*NL*
edge
,
where
the
scout
had
collected
the
rest
of
the
party
,
more
by
the
*NL*
agency
of
expressive
gestures
than
by
any
use
of
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
to
do
with
these
dumb
creatures
!
''
muttered
the
white
man
,
on
whom
*NL*
the
sole
control
of
their
future
movements
appeared
to
devolve
;
``
it
*NL*
would
be
time
lost
to
cut
their
throats
,
and
cast
them
into
the
river
;
*NL*
and
to
leave
them
here
would
be
to
tell
the
Mingoes
that
they
have
not
*NL*
far
to
seek
to
find
their
owners
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
give
them
their
bridles
,
and
let
them
range
the
woods

''
Heyward
*NL*
ventured
to
suggest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
it
would
be
better
to
mislead
the
imps
,
and
make
them
believe
they
*NL*
must
equal
a
horse
's
speed
to
run
down
their
chase
.
Ay
,
ay
,
that
will
*NL*
blind
their
fireballs
of
eyes
!
Chingach

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
colt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
colt
,
at
least
,
must
die
,
''
muttered
the
scout
,
grasping
at
the
*NL*
mane
of
the
nimble
beast
,
which
easily
eluded
his
hand
;
``
Uncas
,
your
*NL*
arrows
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hold
!
''
exclaimed
the
proprietor
of
the
condemned
animal
,
aloud
,
without
*NL*
regard
to
the
whispering
tones
used
by
the
others
;
``
spare
the
foal
*NL*
of
Miriam
!
it
is
the
comely
offspring
of
a
faithful
dam
,
and
would
*NL*
willingly
injure
naught
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
men
struggle
for
the
single
life
God
has
given
them
,
''
said
the
*NL*
scout
,
sternly
,
``
even
their
own
kind
seem
no
more
than
the
beasts
of
the
*NL*
wood
.
If
you
speak
again
,
I
shall
leave
you
to
the
mercy
of
the
Maquas
!
*NL*
Draw
to
your
arrow
's
head
,
Uncas
;
we
have
no
time
for
second
blows
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
low
,
muttering
sounds
of
his
threatening
voice
were
still
audible
,
*NL*
when
the
wounded
foal
,
first
rearing
on
its
hinder
legs
,
plunged
forward
*NL*
to
its
knees
.
It
was
met
by
Chingachgook
,
whose
knife
passed
across
its
*NL*
throat
quicker
than
thought
,
and
then
precipitating
the
motions
of
the
*NL*
struggling
victim
,
he
dashed
into
the
river
,
down
whose
stream
it
glided
*NL*
away
,
gasping
audibly
for
breath
with
its
ebbing
life
.
This
deed
of
*NL*
apparent
cruelty
,
but
of
real
necessity
,
fell
upon
the
spirits
of
the
*NL*
travelers
like
a
terrific
warning
of
the
peril
in
which
they
stood
,
*NL*
heightened
as
it
was
by
the
calm
though
steady
resolution
of
the
actors
*NL*
in
the
scene
.
The
sisters
shuddered
and
clung
closer
to
each
other
,
*NL*
while
Heyward
instinctively
laid
his
hand
on
one
of
the
pistols
he
had
*NL*
just
drawn
from
their
holsters
,
as
he
placed
himself
between
his
charge
*NL*
and
those
dense
shadows
that
seemed
to
draw
an
impenetrable
veil
before
*NL*
the
bosom
of
the
forest
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Indians
,
however
,
hesitated
not
a
moment
,
but
taking
the
bridles
,
*NL*
they
led
the
frightened
and
reluctant
horses
into
the
bed
of
the
river
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
a
short
distance
from
the
shore
they
turned
,
and
were
soon
concealed
*NL*
by
the
projection
of
the
bank
,
under
the
brow
of
which
they
moved
,
in
*NL*
a
direction
opposite
to
the
course
of
the
waters
.
In
the
meantime
,
the
*NL*
scout
drew
a
canoe
of
bark
from
its
place
of
concealment
beneath
some
*NL*
low
bushes
,
whose
branches
were
waving
with
the
eddies
of
the
current
,
*NL*
into
which
he
silently
motioned
for
the
females
to
enter
.
They
complied
*NL*
without
hesitation
,
though
many
a
fearful
and
anxious
glance
was
thrown
*NL*
behind
them
,
toward
the
thickening
gloom
,
which
now
lay
like
a
dark
*NL*
barrier
along
the
margin
of
the
stream
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
soon
as
Cora
and
Alice
were
seated
,
the
scout
,
without
regarding
the
*NL*
element
,
directed
Heyward
to
support
one
side
of
the
frail
vessel
,
*NL*
and
posting
himself
at
the
other
,
they
bore
it
up
against
the
stream
,
*NL*
followed
by
the
dejected
owner
of
the
dead
foal
.
In
this
manner
they
*NL*
proceeded
,
for
many
rods
,
in
a
silence
that
was
only
interrupted
by
the
*NL*
rippling
of
the
water
,
as
its
eddies
played
around
them
,
or
the
low
dash
*NL*
made
by
their
own
cautious
footsteps
.
Heyward
yielded
the
guidance
of
*NL*
the
canoe
implicitly
to
the
scout
,
who
approached
or
receded
from
the
*NL*
shore
,
to
avoid
the
fragments
of
rocks
,
or
deeper
parts
of
the
river
,
*NL*
with
a
readiness
that
showed
his
knowledge
of
the
route
they
held
.
*NL*
Occasionally
he
would
stop
;
and
in
the
midst
of
a
breathing
stillness
,
*NL*
that
the
dull
but
increasing
roar
of
the
waterfall
only
served
to
render
*NL*
more
impressive
,
he
would
listen
with
painful
intenseness
,
to
catch
any
*NL*
sounds
that
might
arise
from
the
slumbering
forest
.
When
assured
that
*NL*
all
was
still
,
and
unable
to
detect
,
even
by
the
aid
of
his
practiced
*NL*
senses
,
any
sign
of
his
approaching
foes
,
he
would
deliberately
resume
*NL*
his
slow
and
guarded
progress
.
At
length
they
reached
a
point
in
the
*NL*
river
where
the
roving
eye
of
Heyward
became
riveted
on
a
cluster
of
*NL*
black
objects
,
collected
at
a
spot
where
the
high
bank
threw
a
deeper
*NL*
shadow
than
usual
on
the
dark
waters
.
Hesitating
to
advance
,
he
pointed
*NL*
out
the
place
to
the
attention
of
his
companion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
''
returned
the
composed
scout
,
``
the
Indians
have
hid
the
beasts
with
*NL*
the
judgment
of
natives
!
Water
leaves
no
trail
,
and
an
owl
's
eyes
would
*NL*
be
blinded
by
the
darkness
of
such
a
hole
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
whole
party
was
soon
reunited
,
and
another
consultation
was
held
*NL*
between
the
scout
and
his
new
comrades
,
during
which
,
they
,
whose
fates
*NL*
depended
on
the
faith
and
ingenuity
of
these
unknown
foresters
,
had
a
*NL*
little
leisure
to
observe
their
situation
more
minutely
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
river
was
confined
between
high
and
cragged
rocks
,
one
of
which
*NL*
impended
above
the
spot
where
the
canoe
rested
.
As
these
,
again
,
were
*NL*
surmounted
by
tall
trees
,
which
appeared
to
totter
on
the
brows
of
the
*NL*
precipice
,
it
gave
the
stream
the
appearance
of
running
through
a
deep
*NL*
and
narrow
dell
.
All
beneath
the
fantastic
limbs
and
ragged
tree
tops
,
*NL*
which
were
,
here
and
there
,
dimly
painted
against
the
starry
zenith
,
*NL*
lay
alike
in
shadowed
obscurity
.
Behind
them
,
the
curvature
of
the
banks
*NL*
soon
bounded
the
view
by
the
same
dark
and
wooded
outline
;
but
in
front
,
*NL*
and
apparently
at
no
great
distance
,
the
water
seemed
piled
against
*NL*
the
heavens
,
whence
it
tumbled
into
caverns
,
out
of
which
issued
those
*NL*
sullen
sounds
that
had
loaded
the
evening
atmosphere
.
It
seemed
,
in
*NL*
truth
,
to
be
a
spot
devoted
to
seclusion
,
and
the
sisters
imbibed
a
*NL*
soothing
impression
of
security
,
as
they
gazed
upon
its
romantic
though
*NL*
not
unappalling
beauties
.
A
general
movement
among
their
conductors
,
*NL*
however
,
soon
recalled
them
from
a
contemplation
of
the
wild
charms
that
*NL*
night
had
assisted
to
lend
the
place
to
a
painful
sense
of
their
real
*NL*
peril
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
horses
had
been
secured
to
some
scattering
shrubs
that
grew
in
the
*NL*
fissures
of
the
rocks
,
where
,
standing
in
the
water
,
they
were
left
to
*NL*
pass
the
night
.
The
scout
directed
Heyward
and
his
disconsolate
fellow
*NL*
travelers
to
seat
themselves
in
the
forward
end
of
the
canoe
,
and
took
*NL*
possession
of
the
other
himself
,
as
erect
and
steady
as
if
he
floated
*NL*
in
a
vessel
of
much
firmer
materials
.
The
Indians
warily
retraced
their
*NL*
steps
toward
the
place
they
had
left
,
when
the
scout
,
placing
his
pole
*NL*
against
a
rock
,
by
a
powerful
shove
,
sent
his
frail
bark
directly
into
*NL*
the
turbulent
stream
.
For
many
minutes
the
struggle
between
the
light
*NL*
bubble
in
which
they
floated
and
the
swift
current
was
severe
and
*NL*
doubtful
.
Forbidden
to
stir
even
a
hand
,
and
almost
afraid
to
breath
,
*NL*
lest
they
should
expose
the
frail
fabric
to
the
fury
of
the
stream
,
*NL*
the
passengers
watched
the
glancing
waters
in
feverish
suspense
.
*NL*
Twenty
times
they
thought
the
whirling
eddies
were
sweeping
them
to
*NL*
destruction
,
when
the
master-hand
of
their
pilot
would
bring
the
bows
of
*NL*
the
canoe
to
stem
the
rapid
.
A
long
,
a
vigorous
,
and
,
as
it
appeared
*NL*
to
the
females
,
a
desperate
effort
,
closed
the
struggle
.
Just
as
Alice
*NL*
veiled
her
eyes
in
horror
,
under
the
impression
that
they
were
about
*NL*
to
be
swept
within
the
vortex
at
the
foot
of
the
cataract
,
the
canoe
*NL*
floated
,
stationary
,
at
the
side
of
a
flat
rock
,
that
lay
on
a
level
*NL*
with
the
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
are
we
,
and
what
is
next
to
be
done
!
''
demanded
Heyward
,
*NL*
perceiving
that
the
exertions
of
the
scout
had
ceased
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
at
the
foot
of
Glenn
's
,
''
returned
the
other
,
speaking
aloud
,
*NL*
without
fear
of
consequences
within
the
roar
of
the
cataract
;
``
and
the
*NL*
next
thing
is
to
make
a
steady
landing
,
lest
the
canoe
upset
,
and
you
*NL*
should
go
down
again
the
hard
road
we
have
traveled
faster
than
you
came
*NL*
up
;
't
is
a
hard
rift
to
stem
,
when
the
river
is
a
little
swelled
;
and
*NL*
five
is
an
unnatural
number
to
keep
dry
,
in
a
hurry-skurry
,
with
a
*NL*
little
birchen
bark
and
gum
.
There
,
go
you
all
on
the
rock
,
and
I
will
*NL*
bring
up
the
Mohicans
with
the
venison
.
A
man
had
better
sleep
without
*NL*
his
scalp
,
than
famish
in
the
midst
of
plenty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
passengers
gladly
complied
with
these
directions
.
As
the
last
foot
*NL*
touched
the
rock
,
the
canoe
whirled
from
its
station
,
when
the
tall
form
*NL*
of
the
scout
was
seen
,
for
an
instant
,
gliding
above
the
waters
,
before
*NL*
it
disappeared
in
the
impenetrable
darkness
that
rested
on
the
bed
of
*NL*
the
river
.
Left
by
their
guide
,
the
travelers
remained
a
few
minutes
in
*NL*
helpless
ignorance
,
afraid
even
to
move
along
the
broken
rocks
,
lest
a
*NL*
false
step
should
precipitate
them
down
some
one
of
the
many
deep
and
*NL*
roaring
caverns
,
into
which
the
water
seemed
to
tumble
,
on
every
side
*NL*
of
them
.
Their
suspense
,
however
,
was
soon
relieved
;
for
,
aided
by
the
*NL*
skill
of
the
natives
,
the
canoe
shot
back
into
the
eddy
,
and
floated
*NL*
again
at
the
side
of
the
low
rock
,
before
they
thought
the
scout
had
*NL*
even
time
to
rejoin
his
companions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
now
fortified
,
garrisoned
,
and
provisioned
,
''
cried
Heyward
*NL*
cheerfully
,
``
and
may
set
Montcalm
and
his
allies
at
defiance
.
How
,
now
,
*NL*
my
vigilant
sentinel
,
can
see
anything
of
those
you
call
the
Iroquois
,
*NL*
on
the
main
land
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
call
them
Iroquois
,
because
to
me
every
native

who
speaks
a
foreign
*NL*
tongue
,
is
accounted
an
enemy
,
though
he
may
pretend
to
serve
the
king
!
*NL*
If
Webb
wants
faith
and
honesty
in
an
Indian
,
let
him
bring
out
the
*NL*
tribes
of
the
Delawares
,
and
send
these
greedy
and
lying
Mohawks
and
*NL*
Oneidas
,
with
their
six
nations
of
varlets
,
where
in
nature
they
belong
,
*NL*
among
the
French

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
should
then
exchange
a
warlike
for
a
useless
friend

I
have
heard

Delawares

laid
aside

called

*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye

shame
on
the
Hollanders

circumvented
them

their
deviltries

a
treaty

But
I
have
known

for
twenty

years
,

I
call
him
liar
that
says
cowardly

runs
in

You
have
driven

*NL*
now
believe

their
enemies
say

that
you
may
sleep
at
night
upon
an
*NL*
easy
pillow

No

no

to
me
,
every
Indian
who
speaks
a
foreign
tongue
*NL*
is
an
Iroquois

whether
the

be
in
*NL*
York

*NL*
*NL*
*
The
principal
villages
of
the
Indians
are
still
called
*NL*
``
castles

by
the
whites
of
New
York
.
``
Oneida
castle

is
no
*NL*
more
than
a
scattered
hamlet
;
but
the
name
is
in
general
*NL*
use

*NL*
*NL*
Heyward
,
perceiving
that
the
stubborn
adherence
of
the
scout
to
the
*NL*
cause
of
his
friends
the
Delawares
,
or
Mohicans
,
for
they
were
branches
*NL*
of
the
same
numerous
people
,
was
likely
to
prolong
a
useless
discussion
,
*NL*
changed
the
subject
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Treaty

I
know
full
well
that

seen
anything

enemies

*NL*
*NL*
``
An
Indian
is
a
mortal
to
be
felt
afore
he
is
seen
,
''
returned
the
scout
,
*NL*
ascending
the
rock
,
and
throwing
the
deer
carelessly
down
.
``
I
trust
to
*NL*
other
signs

such
as
come

when
I
am

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do

a
smart
scrimmage

I
will
not
deny
,
however
,
*NL*
but
the
horses
cowered
when
I
passed
them
,
as
though
they
scented
the
*NL*
wolves
;
and
a
wolf
is
a
beast
that
is
apt
to
hover
about
an
Indian
*NL*
ambushment
,
craving
the
offals
of
the
deer
the
savages
kill
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
forget

buck

may
we
not

colt
?
Ha
!
what
noise
is
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
Miriam

''
murmured
the
stranger
;
``
thy
foal
was
foreordained
to
*NL*
become
a
prey

ravenous
beasts

''
Then
,
suddenly
lifting
up
his
voice
,
*NL*
amid
the
eternal
din
of
the
waters
,
he
sang
aloud
:
``
First
born
of
Egypt
,
*NL*
smite
did
he
,
Of
mankind

and
of
beast
also
:
O

wonders

On

*NL*
*NL*
``
The
death
of
the
colt
sits
heavy
on
the
heart
of
its
owner
,
''
said
the
*NL*
scout
;
``
but
it
's
a
good
sign
to
see
a
man
account
upon
his
dumb
friends

*NL*
He
has
the
religion
of
the
matter
,
in
believing
what
is
to
happen
will
*NL*
happen
;
and
with
such
a
consolation
,
it
wo
n't
be
long
afore
he
submits
*NL*
to
the
rationality
of
killing
a
four-footed
beast
to
save
the
lives
of
*NL*
human
men
.
It
may
be
as
you
say
,
''
he
continued
,
reverting
to
the
purport
*NL*
of
Heyward
's
last
remark
;
``
and
the
greater
the
reason
why
we
should
cut
*NL*
our
steaks
,
and
let
the
carcass
drive
down
the
stream
,
or
we
shall
have
*NL*
the
pack
howling
along
the
cliffs
,
begrudging
every
mouthful
we
swallow
.
*NL*
Besides
,
though
the
Delaware
tongue
is
the
same
as
a
book
to
the
*NL*
Iroquois
,
the
cunning
varlets
are
quick
enough
at
understanding
the
*NL*
reason
of
a
wolf
's
howl

*NL*
*NL*
The
scout
,
while
making
his
remarks
,
was
busied
in
collecting
certain
*NL*
necessary
implements
;
as
he
concluded
,
he
moved
silently
by
the
group
*NL*
of
travelers
,
accompanied
by
the
Mohicans
,
who
seemed
to
comprehend
his
*NL*
intentions
with
instinctive
readiness
,
when
the
whole
three
*NL*
disappeared
in
succession
,
seeming
to
vanish
against
the
dark
face
of
*NL*
a
perpendicular
rock
that
rose
to
the
height
of
a
few
yards

within
as

many

Burns
*NL*
*NL*
Heyward
and
his
female
companions
witnessed
this
mysterious
movement
*NL*
with
secret
uneasiness
;
for
,
though
the
conduct
of
the
white
man
had
*NL*
hitherto
been
above
reproach
,
his
rude
equipments
,
blunt
address
,
*NL*
and
strong
antipathies
,
together
with
the
character
of
his
silent
*NL*
associates
,
were
all
causes
for
exciting
distrust
in
minds
that
had
been
*NL*
so
recently
alarmed
by
Indian
treachery
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
stranger
alone
disregarded
the
passing
incidents
.
He
seated
*NL*
himself
on
a
projection
of
the
rocks
,
whence
he
gave
no
other
signs
*NL*
of
consciousness
than
by
the
struggles
of
his
spirit
,
as
manifested
in
*NL*
frequent
and
heavy
sighs
.
Smothered
voices
were
next
heard
,
as
though
*NL*
men
called
to
each
other
in
the
bowels
of
the
earth
,
when
a
sudden
light
*NL*
flashed
upon
those
without
,
and
laid
bare
the
much-prized
secret
of
the
*NL*
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
further
extremity
of
a
narrow
,
deep
cavern
in
the
rock
,
whose
*NL*
length
appeared
much
extended
by
the
perspective
and
the
nature
of
the
*NL*
light
by
which
it
was
seen
,
was
seated
the
scout
,
holding
a
blazing
*NL*
knot
of
pine
.
The
strong
glare
of
the
fire
fell
full
upon
his
sturdy
,
*NL*
weather-beaten
countenance
and
forest
attire
,
lending
an
air
of
romantic
*NL*
wildness
to
the
aspect
of
an
individual
,
who
,
seen
by
the
sober
light
of
*NL*
day
,
would
have
exhibited
the
peculiarities
of
a
man
remarkable
for
the
*NL*
strangeness
of
his
dress
,
the
iron-like
inflexibility
of
his
frame
,
*NL*
and
the
singular
compound
of
quick
,
vigilant
sagacity
,
and
of
exquisite
*NL*
simplicity
,
that
by
turns
usurped
the
possession
of
his
muscular
*NL*
features
.
At
a
little
distance
in
advance
stood
Uncas
,
his
whole
person
*NL*
thrown
powerfully
into
view
.
The
travelers
anxiously
regarded
the
*NL*
upright
,
flexible
figure
of
the
young
Mohican
,
graceful
and
unrestrained
*NL*
in
the
attitudes
and
movements
of
nature
.
Though
his
person
was
more
*NL*
than
usually
screened
by
a
green
and
fringed
hunting-shirt
,
like
that
of
*NL*
the
white
man
,
there
was
no
concealment
to
his
dark
,
glancing
,
fearless
*NL*
eye
,
alike
terrible
and
calm
;
the
bold
outline
of
his
high
,
haughty
*NL*
features
,
pure
in
their
native
red
;
or
to
the
dignified
elevation
of
his
*NL*
receding
forehead
,
together
with
all
the
finest
proportions
of
a
noble
*NL*
head
,
bared
to
the
generous
scalping
tuft
.
It
was
the
first
opportunity
*NL*
possessed
by
Duncan
and
his
companions
to
view
the
marked
lineaments
of
*NL*
either
of
their
Indian
attendants
,
and
each
individual
of
the
party
felt
*NL*
relieved
from
a
burden
of
doubt
,
as
the
proud
and
determined
,
though
*NL*
wild
expression
of
the
features
of
the
young
warrior
forced
itself
on
*NL*
their
notice
.
They
felt
it
might
be
a
being
partially
benighted
in
the
*NL*
vale
of
ignorance
,
but
it
could
not
be
one
who
would
willingly
devote
*NL*
his
rich
natural
gifts
to
the
purposes
of
wanton
treachery
.
The
*NL*
ingenuous
Alice
gazed
at
his
free
air
and
proud
carriage
,
as
she
would
*NL*
have
looked
upon
some
precious
relic
of
the
Grecian
chisel
,
to
which
*NL*
life
had
been
imparted
by
the
intervention
of
a
miracle
;
while
Heyward
,
*NL*
though
accustomed
to
see
the
perfection
of
form
which
abounds
among
*NL*
the
uncorrupted
natives
,
openly
expressed
his
admiration
at
such
an
*NL*
unblemished
specimen
of
the
noblest
proportions
of
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
sleep
in
peace
,
''
whispered
Alice
,
in
reply
,
``
with
such
a
*NL*
fearless
and
generous-looking
youth
for
my
sentinel
.
Surely
,
Duncan
,
*NL*
those
cruel
murders
,
those
terrific
scenes
of
torture
,
of
which
we
read
*NL*
and
hear
so
much
,
are
never
acted
in
the
presence
of
such
as
he
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
certainly
is
a
rare
and
brilliant
instance
of
those
natural
*NL*
qualities
in
which
these
peculiar
people
are
said
to
excel
,
''
he
*NL*
answered
.
``
I
agree
with
you
,
Alice
,
in
thinking
that
such
a
front
and
*NL*
eye
were
formed
rather
to
intimidate
than
to
deceive
;
but
let
us
not
*NL*
practice
a
deception
upon
ourselves
,
by
expecting
any
other
exhibition
*NL*
of
what
we
esteem
virtue
than
according
to
the
fashion
of
the
savage
.
*NL*
As
bright
examples
of
great
qualities
are
but
too
uncommon
among
*NL*
Christians
,
so
are
they
singular
and
solitary
with
the
Indians
;
though
,
*NL*
for
the
honor
of
our
common
nature
,
neither
are
incapable
of
producing
*NL*
them
.
Let
us
then
hope
that
this
Mohican
may
not
disappoint
our
wishes
,
*NL*
but
prove
what
his
looks
assert
him
to
be
,
a
brave
and
constant
friend
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
Major
Heyward
speaks
as
Major
Heyward
should
,
''
said
Cora
;
``
who
that
*NL*
looks
at
this
creature
of
nature
,
remembers
the
shade
of
his
skin
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
short
and
apparently
an
embarrassed
silence
succeeded
this
remark
,
*NL*
which
was
interrupted
by
the
scout
calling
to
them
,
aloud
,
to
enter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
fire
begins
to
show
too
bright
a
flame
,
''
he
continued
,
as
they
*NL*
complied
,
``
and
might
light
the
Mingoes
to
our
undoing
.
Uncas
,
drop
the
*NL*
blanket
,
and
show
the
knaves
its
dark
side
.
This
is
not
such
a
supper
*NL*
as
a
major
of
the
Royal
Americans
has
a
right
to
expect
,
but
I
've
*NL*
known
stout
detachments
of
the
corps
glad
to
eat
their
venison
raw
,
and
*NL*
without
a
relish
,
too
*
.
Here
,
you
see
,
we
have
plenty
of
salt
,
and
can
*NL*
make
a
quick
broil
.
There
's
fresh
sassafras
boughs
for
the
ladies
to
sit
*NL*
on
,
which
may
not
be
as
proud
as
their
my-hog-guinea
chairs
,
but
which
*NL*
sends
up
a
sweeter
flavor
,
than
the
skin
of
any
hog
can
do
,
be
it
of
*NL*
Guinea
,
or
be
it
of
any
other
land
.
Come
,
friend
,
do
n't
be
mournful
for
*NL*
the
colt
;
't
was
an
innocent
thing
,
and
had
not
seen
much
hardship
.
Its
*NL*
death
will
save
the
creature
many
a
sore
back
and
weary
foot
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
*
In
vulgar
parlance
the
condiments
of
a
repast
are
called
*NL*
by
the
American
``
a
relish
,
''
substituting
the
thing
for
its
*NL*
effect
.
These
provincial
terms
are
frequently
put
in
the
*NL*
mouths
of
the
speakers
,
according
to
their
several
*NL*
conditions
in
life
.
Most
of
them
are
of
local
use
,
and
*NL*
others
quite
peculiar
to
the
particular
class
of
men
to
*NL*
which
the
character
belongs
.
In
the
present
instance
,
the
*NL*
scout
uses
the
word
with
immediate
reference
to
the
``
salt
,
''
*NL*
with
which
his
own
party
was
so
fortunate
as
to
be
provided
.
*NL*
*NL*
Uncas
did
as
the
other
had
directed
,
and
when
the
voice
of
Hawkeye
*NL*
ceased
,
the
roar
of
the
cataract
sounded
like
the
rumbling
of
distant
*NL*
thunder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
we
quite
safe
in
this
cavern
?
''
demanded
Heyward
.
``
Is
there
no
*NL*
danger
of
surprise
?
A
single
armed
man
,
at
its
entrance
,
would
hold
us
*NL*
at
his
mercy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
spectral-looking
figure
stalked
from
out
of
the
darkness
behind
the
*NL*
scout
,
and
seizing
a
blazing
brand
,
held
it
toward
the
further
extremity
*NL*
of
their
place
of
retreat
.
Alice
uttered
a
faint
shriek
,
and
even
Cora
*NL*
rose
to
her
feet
,
as
this
appalling
object
moved
into
the
light
;
but
*NL*
a
single
word
from
Heyward
calmed
them
,
with
the
assurance
it
was
only
*NL*
their
attendant
,
Chingachgook
,
who
,
lifting
another
blanket
,
discovered
*NL*
that
the
cavern
had
two
outlets
.
Then
,
holding
the
brand
,
he
crossed
*NL*
a
deep
,
narrow
chasm
in
the
rocks
which
ran
at
right
angles
with
the
*NL*
passage
they
were
in
,
but
which
,
unlike
that
,
was
open
to
the
heavens
,
*NL*
and
entered
another
cave
,
answering
to
the
description
of
the
first
,
in
*NL*
every
essential
particular
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Such
old
foxes
as
Chingachgook
and
myself
are
not
often
caught
in
a
*NL*
barrow
with
one
hole
,
''
said
Hawkeye
,
laughing
;
``
you
can
easily
see
the
*NL*
cunning
of
the
place
--
the
rock
is
black
limestone
,
which
everybody
knows
*NL*
is
soft
;
it
makes
no
uncomfortable
pillow
,
where
brush
and
pine
wood
is
*NL*
scarce
;
well
,
the
fall
was
once
a
few
yards
below
us
,
and
I
dare
to
say
*NL*
was
,
in
its
time
,
as
regular
and
as
handsome
a
sheet
of
water
as
any
*NL*
along
the
Hudson
.
But
old
age
is
a
great
injury
to
good
looks
,
as
these
*NL*
sweet
young
ladies
have
yet
to
l'arn
!
The
place
is
sadly
changed
!
These
*NL*
rocks
are
full
of
cracks
,
and
in
some
places
they
are
softer
than
at
*NL*
othersome
,
and
the
water
has
worked
out
deep
hollows
for
itself
,
until
*NL*
it
has
fallen
back
,
ay
,
some
hundred
feet
,
breaking
here
and
wearing
*NL*
there
,
until
the
falls
have
neither
shape
nor
consistency
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
what
part
of
them
are
we
?
''
asked
Heyward
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
we
are
nigh
the
spot
that
Providence
first
placed
them
at
,
but
*NL*
where
,
it
seems
,
they
were
too
rebellious
to
stay
.
The
rock
proved
*NL*
softer
on
each
side
of
us
,
and
so
they
left
the
center
of
the
river
bare
*NL*
and
dry
,
first
working
out
these
two
little
holes
for
us
to
hide
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
then
on
an
island
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
!
there
are
the
falls
on
two
sides
of
us
,
and
the
river
above
and
*NL*
below
.
If
you
had
daylight
,
it
would
be
worth
the
trouble
to
step
up
*NL*
on
the
height
of
this
rock
,
and
look
at
the
perversity
of
the
water
.
It
*NL*
falls
by
no
rule
at
all
;
sometimes
it
leaps
,
sometimes
it
tumbles
;
*NL*
there
it
skips
;
here
it
shoots
;
in
one
place
't
is
white
as
snow
,
and
in
*NL*
another
't
is
green
as
grass
;
hereabouts
,
it
pitches
into
deep
hollows
,
*NL*
that
rumble
and
crush
the
`
arth
;
and
thereaways
,
it
ripples
and
sings
*NL*
like
a
brook
,
fashioning
whirlpools
and
gullies
in
the
old
stone
,
as
if
*NL*
't
was
no
harder
than
trodden
clay
.
The
whole
design
of
the
river
seems
*NL*
disconcerted
.
First
it
runs
smoothly
,
as
if
meaning
to
go
down
the
*NL*
descent
as
things
were
ordered
;
then
it
angles
about
and
faces
the
*NL*
shores
;
nor
are
there
places
wanting
where
it
looks
backward
,
as
if
*NL*
unwilling
to
leave
the
wilderness
,
to
mingle
with
the
salt
.
Ay
,
lady
,
*NL*
the
fine
cobweb-looking
cloth
you
wear
at
your
throat
is
coarse
,
*NL*
and
like
a
fishnet
,
to
little
spots
I
can
show
you
,
where
the
river
*NL*
fabricates
all
sorts
of
images
,
as
if
having
broke
loose
from
order
,
it
*NL*
would
try
its
hand
at
everything
.
And
yet
what
does
it
amount
to
!
After
*NL*
the
water
has
been
suffered
so
to
have
its
will
,
for
a
time
,
like
a
*NL*
headstrong
man
,
it
is
gathered
together
by
the
hand
that
made
it
,
and
a
*NL*
few
rods
below
you
may
see
it
all
,
flowing
on
steadily
toward
the
sea
,
*NL*
as
was
foreordained
from
the
first
foundation
of
the
`
arth
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
his
auditors
received
a
cheering
assurance
of
the
security
of
*NL*
their
place
of
concealment
from
this
untutored
description
of
Glenn
's
,
*
*NL*
they
were
much
inclined
to
judge
differently
from
Hawkeye
,
of
its
wild
*NL*
beauties
.
But
they
were
not
in
a
situation
to
suffer
their
thoughts
to
*NL*
dwell
on
the
charms
of
natural
objects
;
and
,
as
the
scout
had
not
found
*NL*
it
necessary
to
cease
his
culinary
labors
while
he
spoke
,
unless
to
*NL*
point
out
,
with
a
broken
fork
,
the
direction
of
some
particularly
*NL*
obnoxious
point
in
the
rebellious
stream
,
they
now
suffered
their
*NL*
attention
to
be
drawn
to
the
necessary
though
more
vulgar
consideration
*NL*
of
their
supper
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
Glenn
's
Falls
are
on
the
Hudson
,
some
forty
or
fifty
miles
*NL*
above
the
head
of
tide
,
or
that
place
where
the
river
*NL*
becomes
navigable
for
sloops
.
The
description
of
this
*NL*
picturesque
and
remarkable
little
cataract
,
as
given
by
the
*NL*
scout
,
is
sufficiently
correct
,
though
the
application
of
*NL*
the
water
to
uses
of
civilized
life
has
materially
injured
*NL*
its
beauties
.
The
rocky
island
and
the
two
caverns
are
known
*NL*
to
every
traveler
,
since
the
former
sustains
the
pier
of
a
*NL*
bridge
,
which
is
now
thrown
across
the
river
,
immediately
*NL*
above
the
fall
.
In
explanation
of
the
taste
of
Hawkeye
,
it
*NL*
should
be
remembered
that
men
always
prize
that
most
which
*NL*
is
least
enjoyed
.
Thus
,
in
a
new
country
,
the
woods
and
*NL*
other
objects
,
which
in
an
old
country
would
be
maintained
*NL*
at
great
cost
,
are
got
rid
of
,
simply
with
a
view
of
*NL*
``
improving
''
as
it
is
called
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
repast
,
which
was
greatly
aided
by
the
addition
of
a
few
delicacies
*NL*
that
Heyward
had
the
precaution
to
bring
with
him
when
they
left
their
*NL*
horses
,
was
exceedingly
refreshing
to
the
weary
party
.
Uncas
acted
as
*NL*
attendant
to
the
females
,
performing
all
the
little
offices
within
his
*NL*
power
,
with
a
mixture
of
dignity
and
anxious
grace
,
that
served
to
amuse
*NL*
Heyward
,
who
well
knew
that
it
was
an
utter
innovation
on
the
*NL*
Indian
customs
,
which
forbid
their
warriors
to
descend
to
any
menial
*NL*
employment
,
especially
in
favor
of
their
women
.
As
the
rights
of
*NL*
hospitality
were
,
however
,
considered
sacred
among
them
,
this
little
*NL*
departure
from
the
dignity
of
manhood
excited
no
audible
comment
.
Had
*NL*
there
been
one
there
sufficiently
disengaged
to
become
a
close
observer
,
*NL*
he
might
have
fancied
that
the
services
of
the
young
chief
were
not
*NL*
entirely
impartial
.
That
while
he
tendered
to
Alice
the
gourd
of
sweet
*NL*
water
,
and
the
venison
in
a
trencher
,
neatly
carved
from
the
knot
of
the
*NL*
pepperidge
,
with
sufficient
courtesy
,
in
performing
the
same
offices
*NL*
to
her
sister
,
his
dark
eye
lingered
on
her
rich
,
speaking
countenance
.
*NL*
Once
or
twice
he
was
compelled
to
speak
,
to
command
her
attention
*NL*
of
those
he
served
.
In
such
cases
he
made
use
of
English
,
broken
and
*NL*
imperfect
,
but
sufficiently
intelligible
,
and
which
he
rendered
so
mild
*NL*
and
musical
,
by
his
deep
,
guttural
voice
,
that
it
never
failed
to
cause
*NL*
both
ladies
to
look
up
in
admiration
and
astonishment
.
In
the
course
*NL*
of
these
civilities
,
a
few
sentences
were
exchanged
,
that
served
to
*NL*
establish
the
appearance
of
an
amicable
intercourse
between
the
parties
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meanwhile
,
the
gravity
of
Chingcachgook
remained
immovable
.
He
*NL*
had
seated
himself
more
within
the
circle
of
light
,
where
the
frequent
,
*NL*
uneasy
glances
of
his
guests
were
better
enabled
to
separate
the
natural
*NL*
expression
of
his
face
from
the
artificial
terrors
of
the
war
paint
.
*NL*
They
found
a
strong
resemblance
between
father
and
son
,
with
the
*NL*
difference
that
might
be
expected
from
age
and
hardships
.
The
fierceness
*NL*
of
his
countenance
now
seemed
to
slumber
,
and
in
its
place
was
to
be
*NL*
seen
the
quiet
,
vacant
composure
which
distinguishes
an
Indian
warrior
,
*NL*
when
his
faculties
are
not
required
for
any
of
the
greater
purposes
*NL*
of
his
existence
.
It
was
,
however
,
easy
to
be
seen
,
by
the
occasional
*NL*
gleams
that
shot
across
his
swarthy
visage
,
that
it
was
only
necessary
*NL*
to
arouse
his
passions
,
in
order
to
give
full
effect
to
the
terrific
*NL*
device
which
he
had
adopted
to
intimidate
his
enemies
.
On
the
other
*NL*
hand
,
the
quick
,
roving
eye
of
the
scout
seldom
rested
.
He
ate
and
*NL*
drank
with
an
appetite
that
no
sense
of
danger
could
disturb
,
but
his
*NL*
vigilance
seemed
never
to
desert
him
.
Twenty
times
the
gourd
or
the
*NL*
venison
was
suspended
before
his
lips
,
while
his
head
was
turned
aside
,
*NL*
as
though
he
listened
to
some
distant
and
distrusted
sounds
--
a
movement
*NL*
that
never
failed
to
recall
his
guests
from
regarding
the
novelties
*NL*
of
their
situation
,
to
a
recollection
of
the
alarming
reasons
that
had
*NL*
driven
them
to
seek
it
.
As
these
frequent
pauses
were
never
followed
by
*NL*
any
remark
,
the
momentary
uneasiness
they
created
quickly
passed
away
,
*NL*
and
for
a
time
was
forgotten
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
friend
,

said
Hawkeye
,
drawing
out
a
keg
from
beneath
a
cover
of
*NL*
leaves
,
toward
the
close
of
the
repast
,
and
addressing
the
stranger
*NL*
who
sat
at
his
elbow
,
doing
great
justice
to
his
culinary
skill
,
``
try
*NL*
a
little
spruce

`
twill
wash
away
all
thoughts
of
the
colt

and
quicken

life
in
your
bosom

I
drink
to
our
better
friendship

hoping
that
*NL*
a
little
horse-flesh
may
leave
no
heart-burnings
atween
us

How

you
*NL*
name
yourself

*NL*
*NL*
``
Gamut

David
Gamut

returned
the
singing
master
,
preparing
to
wash
*NL*
down
his
sorrows
in
a
powerful
draught
of
the
woodsman
's
high-flavored
*NL*
and
well-laced
compound
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A

``

said
David
,
adjusting
his

iron-rimmed
spectacles
,
and
producing
his
beloved
little
volume
,
*NL*
which
he
immediately
tendered
to
Alice
.
``
What

more
fitting

consolatory

offer
up
evening

such
*NL*
exceeding
jeopardy!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alice
smiled
;
but
,
regarding
Heyward
,
she
blushed
and
hesitated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indulge
yourself
,
''
he
whispered
;
``
ought
not
the
suggestion
of
the
*NL*
worthy
namesake
of
the
Psalmist
to
have
its
weight
at
such
a
moment
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Encouraged
by
his
opinion
,
Alice
did
what
her
pious
inclinations
,
and
*NL*
her
keen
relish
for
gentle
sounds
,
had
before
so
strongly
urged
.
The
*NL*
book
was
open
at
a
hymn
not
ill
adapted
to
their
situation
,
and
in
which
*NL*
the
poet
,
no
longer
goaded
by
his
desire
to
excel
the
inspired
King
*NL*
of
Israel
,
had
discovered
some
chastened
and
respectable
powers
.
Cora
*NL*
betrayed
a
disposition
to
support
her
sister
,
and
the
sacred
song
*NL*
proceeded
,
after
the
indispensable
preliminaries
of
the
pitchpipe
,
and
*NL*
the
tune
had
been
duly
attended
to
by
the
methodical
David
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
air
was
solemn
and
slow
.
At
times
it
rose
to
the
fullest
compass
of
*NL*
the
rich
voices
of
the
females
,
who
hung
over
their
little
book
in
holy
*NL*
excitement
,
and
again
it
sank
so
low
,
that
the
rushing
of
the
waters
ran
*NL*
through
their
melody
,
like
a
hollow
accompaniment
.
The
natural
taste
and
*NL*
true
ear
of
David
governed
and
modified
the
sounds
to
suit
the
confined
*NL*
cavern
,
every
crevice
and
cranny
of
which
was
filled
with
the
thrilling
*NL*
notes
of
their
flexible
voices
.
The
Indians
riveted
their
eyes
on
the
*NL*
rocks
,
and
listened
with
an
attention
that
seemed
to
turn
them
into
*NL*
stone
.
But
the
scout
,
who
had
placed
his
chin
in
his
hand
,
with
an
*NL*
expression
of
cold
indifference
,
gradually
suffered
his
rigid
features
*NL*
to
relax
,
until
,
as
verse
succeeded
verse
,
he
felt
his
iron
nature
*NL*
subdued
,
while
his
recollection
was
carried
back
to
boyhood
,
when
his
*NL*
ears
had
been
accustomed
to
listen
to
similar
sounds
of
praise
,
in
the
*NL*
settlements
of
the
colony
.
His
roving
eyes
began
to
moisten
,
and
before
*NL*
the
hymn
was
ended
scalding
tears
rolled
out
of
fountains
that
had
long
*NL*
seemed
dry
,
and
followed
each
other
down
those
cheeks
,
that
had
oftener
*NL*
felt
the
storms
of
heaven
than
any
testimonials
of
weakness
.
The
singers
*NL*
were
dwelling
on
one
of
those
low
,
dying
chords
,
which
the
ear
devours
*NL*
with
such
greedy
rapture
,
as
if
conscious
that
it
is
about
to
lose
them
,
*NL*
when
a
cry
,
that
seemed
neither
human
nor
earthly
,
rose
in
the
outward
*NL*
air
,
penetrating
not
only
the
recesses
of
the
cavern
,
but
to
the
inmost
*NL*
hearts
of
all
who
heard
it
.
It
was
followed
by
a
stillness
apparently
*NL*
as
deep
as
if
the
waters
had
been
checked
in
their
furious
progress
,
at
*NL*
such
a
horrid
and
unusual
interruption
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
murmured
Alice
,
after
a
few
moments
of
terrible
suspense
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
repeated
Hewyard
aloud
.
*NL*
*NL*
Neither
Hawkeye
nor
the
Indians
made
any
reply
.
They
listened
,
as
if
*NL*
expecting
the
sound
would
be
repeated
,
with
a
manner
that
expressed
*NL*
their
own
astonishment
.
At
length
they
spoke
together
,
earnestly
,
in
the
*NL*
Delaware
language
,
when
Uncas
,
passing
by
the
inner
and
most
concealed
*NL*
aperture
,
cautiously
left
the
cavern
.
When
he
had
gone
,
the
scout
first
*NL*
spoke
in
English
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
it
is
,
or
what
it
is
not
,
none
here
can
tell
,
though
two
of
us
*NL*
have
ranged
the
woods
for
more
than
thirty
years
.
I
did
believe
there
*NL*
was
no
cry
that
Indian
or
beast
could
make
,
that
my
ears
had
not
heard
;
*NL*
but
this
has
proved
that
I
was
only
a
vain
and
conceited
mortal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
it
not
,
then
,
the
shout
the
warriors
make
when
they
wish
to
*NL*
intimidate
their
enemies
?
''
asked
Cora
who
stood
drawing
her
veil
about
*NL*
her
person
,
with
a
calmness
to
which
her
agitated
sister
was
a
stranger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
;
this
was
bad
,
and
shocking
,
and
had
a
sort
of
unhuman
sound
;
*NL*
but
when
you
once
hear
the
war-whoop
,
you
will
never
mistake
it
for
*NL*
anything
else
.
Well
,
Uncas
!
''
speaking
in
Delaware
to
the
young
chief
as
*NL*
he
re-entered
,
``
what
see
you
?
do
our
lights
shine
through
the
blankets
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
answer
was
short
,
and
apparently
decided
,
being
given
in
the
same
*NL*
tongue
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
nothing
to
be
seen
without
,
''
continued
Hawkeye
,
shaking
his
*NL*
head
in
discontent
;
``
and
our
hiding-place
is
still
in
darkness
.
Pass
*NL*
into
the
other
cave
,
you
that
need
it
,
and
seek
for
sleep
;
we
must
*NL*
be
afoot
long
before
the
sun
,
and
make
the
most
of
our
time
to
get
to
*NL*
Edward
,
while
the
Mingoes
are
taking
their
morning
nap
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Cora
set
the
example
of
compliance
,
with
a
steadiness
that
taught
the
*NL*
more
timid
Alice
the
necessity
of
obedience
.
Before
leaving
the
place
,
*NL*
however
,
she
whispered
a
request
to
Duncan
,
that
he
would
follow
.
Uncas
*NL*
raised
the
blanket
for
their
passage
,
and
as
the
sisters
turned
to
thank
*NL*
him
for
this
act
of
attention
,
they
saw
the
scout
seated
again
before
*NL*
the
dying
embers
,
with
his
face
resting
on
his
hands
,
in
a
manner
which
*NL*
showed
how
deeply
he
brooded
on
the
unaccountable
interruption
which
had
*NL*
broken
up
their
evening
devotions
.
*NL*
*NL*
Heyward
took
with
him
a
blazing
knot
,
which
threw
a
dim
light
through
*NL*
the
narrow
vista
of
their
new
apartment
.
Placing
it
in
a
favorable
*NL*
position
,
he
joined
the
females
,
who
now
found
themselves
alone
with
*NL*
him
for
the
first
time
since
they
had
left
the
friendly
ramparts
of
Fort
*NL*
Edward
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Leave
us
not
,
Duncan
,
''
said
Alice
:
``
we
can
not
sleep
in
such
a
place
as
*NL*
this
,
with
that
horrid
cry
still
ringing
in
our
ears
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
First
let
us
examine
into
the
security
of
your
fortress
,
''
he
answered
,
*NL*
``
and
then
we
will
speak
of
rest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
approached
the
further
end
of
the
cavern
,
to
an
outlet
,
which
,
like
*NL*
the
others
,
was
concealed
by
blankets
;
and
removing
the
thick
screen
,
*NL*
breathed
the
fresh
and
reviving
air
from
the
cataract
.
One
arm
of
the
*NL*
river
flowed
through
a
deep
,
narrow
ravine
,
which
its
current
had
*NL*
worn
in
the
soft
rock
,
directly
beneath
his
feet
,
forming
an
effectual
*NL*
defense
,
as
he
believed
,
against
any
danger
from
that
quarter
;
the
*NL*
water
,
a
few
rods
above
them
,
plunging
,
glancing
,
and
sweeping
along
in
*NL*
its
most
violent
and
broken
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nature
has
made
an
impenetrable
barrier
on
this
side
,
''
he
continued
,
*NL*
pointing
down
the
perpendicular
declivity
into
the
dark
current
before
*NL*
he
dropped
the
blanket
;
``
and
as
you
know
that
good
men
and
true
are
on
*NL*
guard
in
front
I
see
no
reason
why
the
advice
of
our
honest
host
should
*NL*
be
disregarded
.
I
am
certain
Cora
will
join
me
in
saying
that
sleep
is
*NL*
necessary
to
you
both
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cora
may
submit
to
the
justice
of
your
opinion
though
she
can
not
put
it
*NL*
in
practice
,
''
returned
the
elder
sister
,
who
had
placed
herself
by
the
*NL*
side
of
Alice
,
on
a
couch
of
sassafras
;
``
there
would
be
other
causes
to
*NL*
chase
away
sleep
,
though
we
had
been
spared
the
shock
of
this
mysterious
*NL*
noise
.
Ask
yourself
,
Heyward
,
can
daughters
forget
the
anxiety
a
father
*NL*
must
endure
,
whose
children
lodge
he
knows
not
where
or
how
,
in
such
a
*NL*
wilderness
,
and
in
the
midst
of
so
many
perils
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
a
soldier
,
and
knows
how
to
estimate
the
chances
of
the
woods
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
a
father
,
and
can
not
deny
his
nature
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
kind
has
he
ever
been
to
all
my
follies
,
how
tender
and
indulgent
*NL*
to
all
my
wishes
!
''
sobbed
Alice
.
``
We
have
been
selfish
,
sister
,
in
*NL*
urging
our
visit
at
such
hazard
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
may
have
been
rash
in
pressing
his
consent
in
a
moment
of
much
*NL*
embarrassment
,
but
I
would
have
proved
to
him
,
that
however
others
might
*NL*
neglect
him
in
his
strait
his
children
at
least
were
faithful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
he
heard
of
your
arrival
at
Edward
,
''
said
Heyward
,
kindly
,
``
there
*NL*
was
a
powerful
struggle
in
his
bosom
between
fear
and
love
;
though
*NL*
the
latter

heightened
,
if
possible
,
by
so
long
a
separation
,
quickly
*NL*
prevailed
.
`
It
is
the
spirit
of
my
noble-minded
Cora
that
leads
them
,
*NL*
Duncan

,
he
said
,
`
and
I
will
not
balk
it
.
Would
to
God
,
that
he
who
*NL*
holds
the
honor

our
royal
master

his
guardianship

would
show

half
her
firmness

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
did
he
not
speak
of
me
,
Heyward
?
''
demanded
Alice
,
with
jealous
*NL*
affection
;
``
surely
,
he
forgot
not
altogether
his
little
Elsie
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
were
impossible
,
''
returned
the
young
man
;
``
he
called
you
by
a
*NL*
thousand
endearing
epithets
,
that
I
may
not
presume
to
use
,
but
to
the
*NL*
justice
of
which
,
I
can
warmly
testify
.
Once
,
indeed

he
said
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Duncan
ceased
speaking
;
for
while
his
eyes
were
riveted
on
those
of
*NL*
Alice
,
who
had
turned
toward
him
with
the
eagerness
of
filial
affection
,
*NL*
to
catch
his
words
,
the
same
strong
,
horrid
cry
,
as
before
,
filled
the
*NL*
air
,
and
rendered
him
mute
.
A
long
,
breathless
silence
succeeded
,
during
*NL*
which
each
looked
at
the
others
in
fearful
expectation
of
hearing
the
*NL*
sound
repeated
.
At
length
,
the
blanket
was
slowly
raised
,
and
the
scout
*NL*
stood
in
the
aperture
with
a
countenance
whose
firmness
evidently
*NL*
began
to
give
way
before
a
mystery
that
seemed
to
threaten
some
danger
,
*NL*
against
which
all
his
cunning
and
experience
might
prove
of
no
avail

`
arth
,
it
*NL*
betokens
another
sort
of
warfare
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
all
our
reasons
for
fear
,
my
friend
,
are
confined
to
such
as
proceed
*NL*
from
supernatural
causes
,
we
have
but
little
occasion
to
be
alarmed
,
''
*NL*
continued
the
undisturbed
Cora
,
``
are
you
certain
that
our
enemies
have
*NL*
not
invented
some
new
and
ingenious
method
to
strike
us
with
terror
,
*NL*
that
their
conquest
may
become
more
easy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lady
,
''
returned
the
scout
,
solemnly
,
``
I
have
listened
to
all
the
sounds
*NL*
of
the
woods
for
thirty
years
,
as
a
man
will
listen
whose
life
and
death
*NL*
depend
on
the
quickness
of
his
ears
.
There
is
no
whine
of
the
panther
,
*NL*
no
whistle
of
the
catbird
,
nor
any
invention
of
the
devilish
Mingoes
,
*NL*
that
can
cheat
me
!
I
have
heard
the
forest
moan
like
mortal
men
in
their
*NL*
affliction
;
often
,
and
again
,
have
I
listened
to
the
wind
playing
*NL*
its
music
in
the
branches
of
the
girdled
trees
;
and
I
have
heard
the
*NL*
lightning
cracking
in
the
air
like
the
snapping
of
blazing
brush
as
it
*NL*
spitted
forth
sparks
and
forked
flames
;
but
never
have
I
thought
that
I
*NL*
heard
more
than
the
pleasure
of
him
who
sported
with
the
things
of
his
*NL*
hand
.
But
neither
the
Mohicans
,
nor
I
,
who
am
a
white
man
without
a
*NL*
cross
,
can
explain
the
cry
just
heard
.
We
,
therefore
,
believe
it
a
sign
*NL*
given
for
our
good
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
extraordinary
!
''
said
Heyward
,
taking
his
pistols
from
the
place
*NL*
where
he
had
laid
them
on
entering
;
``
be
it
a
sign
of
peace
or
a
signal
*NL*
of
war
,
it
must
be
looked
to
.
Lead
the
way
,
my
friend
;
I
follow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
issuing
from
their
place
of
confinement
,
the
whole
party
instantly
*NL*
experienced
a
grateful
renovation
of
spirits
,
by
exchanging
the
pent
*NL*
air
of
the
hiding-place
for
the
cool
and
invigorating
atmosphere
which
*NL*
played
around
the
whirlpools
and
pitches
of
the
cataract
.
A
heavy
*NL*
evening
breeze
swept
along
the
surface
of
the
river
,
and
seemed
to
drive
*NL*
the
roar
of
the
falls
into
the
recesses
of
their
own
cavern
,
whence
it
*NL*
issued
heavily
and
constant
,
like
thunder
rumbling
beyond
the
distant
*NL*
hills
.
The
moon
had
risen
,
and
its
light
was
already
glancing
here
and
*NL*
there
on
the
waters
above
them
;
but
the
extremity
of
the
rock
where
they
*NL*
stood
still
lay
in
shadow
.
With
the
exception
of
the
sounds
produced
*NL*
by
the
rushing
waters
,
and
an
occasional
breathing
of
the
air
,
as
it
*NL*
murmured
past
them
in
fitful
currents
,
the
scene
was
as
still
as
night
*NL*
and
solitude
could
make
it
.
In
vain
were
the
eyes
of
each
individual
*NL*
bent
along
the
opposite
shores
,
in
quest
of
some
signs
of
life
,
that
*NL*
might
explain
the
nature
of
the
interruption
they
had
heard
.
Their
*NL*
anxious
and
eager
looks
were
baffled
by
the
deceptive
light
,
or
rested
*NL*
only
on
naked
rocks
,
and
straight
and
immovable
trees
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
is
nothing
to
be
seen
but
the
gloom
and
quiet
of
a
lovely
*NL*
evening
,
''
whispered
Duncan
;
``
how
much
should
we
prize
such
a
scene
,
and
*NL*
all
this
breathing
solitude
,
at
any
other
moment
,
Cora
!
Fancy
yourselves
*NL*
in
security
,
and
what
now
,
perhaps
,
increases
your
terror
,
may
be
made
*NL*
conducive
to
enjoyment
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
!
''
interrupted
Alice
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
caution
was
unnecessary
.
Once
more
the
same
sound
arose
,
as
if
from
*NL*
the
bed
of
the
river
,
and
having
broken
out
of
the
narrow
bounds
of
the
*NL*
cliffs
,
was
heard
undulating
through
the
forest
,
in
distant
and
dying
*NL*
cadences
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
any
here
give
a
name
to
such
a
cry
?
''
demanded
Hawkeye
,
when
the
*NL*
last
echo
was
lost
in
the
woods
;
``
if
so
,
let
him
speak
;
for
myself
,
I
*NL*
judge
it
not
to
belong
to
`
arth
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
,
then
,
is
one
who
can
undeceive
you
,
''
said
Duncan
;
``
I
know
the
*NL*
sound
full
well
,
for
often
have
I
heard
it
on
the
field
of
battle
,
and
*NL*
in
situations
which
are
frequent
in
a
soldier
's
life
.
'T
is
the
horrid
*NL*
shriek
that
a
horse
will
give
in
his
agony
;
oftener
drawn
from
him
in
*NL*
pain
,
though
sometimes
in
terror
.
My
charger
is
either
a
prey
to
the
*NL*
beasts
of
the
forest
,
or
he
sees
his
danger
,
without
the
power
to
avoid
*NL*
it
.
The
sound
might
deceive
me
in
the
cavern
,
but
in
the
open
air
I
know
*NL*
it
too
well
to
be
wrong
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
scout
and
his
companions
listened
to
this
simple
explanation
with
*NL*
the
interest
of
men
who
imbibe
new
ideas
,
at
the
same
time
that
they
get
*NL*
rid
of
old
ones
,
which
had
proved
disagreeable
inmates
.
The
two
latter
*NL*
uttered
their
usual
expressive
exclamation
,
``
hugh
!
''
as
the
truth
first
*NL*
glanced
upon
their
minds
,
while
the
former
,
after
a
short
,
musing
pause
,
*NL*
took
upon
himself
to
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
deny
your
words
,
''
he
said
,
``
for
I
am
little
skilled
in
horses
,
*NL*
though
born
where
they
abound
.
The
wolves
must
be
hovering
above
their
*NL*
heads
on
the
bank
,
and
the
timorsome
creatures
are
calling
on
man
*NL*
for
help
,
in
the
best
manner
they
are
able
.
Uncas
''
--
he
spoke
in
*NL*
Delaware
--
``
Uncas
,
drop
down
in
the
canoe
,
and
whirl
a
brand
among
the
*NL*
pack
;
or
fear
may
do
what
the
wolves
ca
n't
get
at
to
perform
,
and
leave
*NL*
us
without
horses
in
the
morning
,
when
we
shall
have
so
much
need
to
*NL*
journey
swiftly
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
native
had
already
descended
to
the
water
to
comply
,
when
a
*NL*
long
howl
was
raised
on
the
edge
of
the
river
,
and
was
borne
swiftly
*NL*
off
into
the
depths
of
the
forest
,
as
though
the
beasts
,
of
their
*NL*
own
accord
,
were
abandoning
their
prey
in
sudden
terror
.
Uncas
,
with
*NL*
instinctive
quickness
,
receded
,
and
the
three
foresters
held
another
of
*NL*
their
low
,
earnest
conferences
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
been
like
hunters
who
have
lost
the
points
of
the
heavens
,
and
*NL*
from
whom
the
sun
has
been
hid
for
days
,
''
said
Hawkeye
,
turning
away
*NL*
from
his
companions
;
``
now
we
begin
again
to
know
the
signs
of
our
*NL*
course
,
and
the
paths
are
cleared
from
briers
!
Seat
yourselves
in
the
*NL*
shade
which
the
moon
throws
from
yonder
beech
--
't
is
thicker
than
that
*NL*
of
the
pines
--
and
let
us
wait
for
that
which
the
Lord
may
choose
to
*NL*
send
next
.
Let
all
your
conversation
be
in
whispers
;
though
it
would
be
*NL*
better
,
and
,
perhaps
,
in
the
end
,
wiser
,
if
each
one
held
discourse
with
*NL*
his
own
thoughts
,
for
a
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
manner
of
the
scout
was
seriously
impressive
,
though
no
longer
*NL*
distinguished
by
any
signs
of
unmanly
apprehension
.
It
was
evident
that
*NL*
his
momentary
weakness
had
vanished
with
the
explanation
of
a
mystery
*NL*
which
his
own
experience
had
not
served
to
fathom
;
and
though
he
now
*NL*
felt
all
the
realities
of
their
actual
condition
,
that
he
was
prepared
*NL*
to
meet
them
with
the
energy
of
his
hardy
nature
.
This
feeling
seemed
*NL*
also
common
to
the
natives
,
who
placed
themselves
in
positions
which
*NL*
commanded
a
full
view
of
both
shores
,
while
their
own
persons
were
*NL*
effectually
concealed
from
observation
.
In
such
circumstances
,
common
*NL*
prudence
dictated
that
Heyward
and
his
companions
should
imitate
a
*NL*
caution
that
proceeded
from
so
intelligent
a
source
.
The
young
man
drew
*NL*
a
pile
of
the
sassafras
from
the
cave
,
and
placing
it
in
the
chasm
which
*NL*
separated
the
two
caverns
,
it
was
occupied
by
the
sisters
,
who
were
*NL*
thus
protected
by
the
rocks
from
any
missiles
,
while
their
anxiety
*NL*
was
relieved
by
the
assurance
that
no
danger
could
approach
without
*NL*
a
warning
.
Heyward
himself
was
posted
at
hand
,
so
near
that
he
might
*NL*
communicate
with
his
companions
without
raising
his
voice
to
a
dangerous
*NL*
elevation
;
while
David
,
in
imitation
of
the
woodsmen
,
bestowed
his
*NL*
person
in
such
a
manner
among
the
fissures
of
the
rocks
,
that
his
*NL*
ungainly
limbs
were
no
longer
offensive
to
the
eye
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
manner
hours
passed
without
further
interruption
.
The
moon
*NL*
reached
the
zenith
,
and
shed
its
mild
light
perpendicularly
on
the
*NL*
lovely
sight
of
the
sisters
slumbering
peacefully
in
each
other
's
arms
.
*NL*
Duncan
cast
the
wide
shawl
of
Cora
before
a
spectacle
he
so
much
loved
*NL*
to
contemplate
,
and
then
suffered
his
own
head
to
seek
a
pillow
on
the
*NL*
rock
.
David
began
to
utter
sounds
that
would
have
shocked
his
delicate
*NL*
organs
in
more
wakeful
moments
;
in
short
,
all
but
Hawkeye
and
the
*NL*
Mohicans
lost
every
idea
of
consciousness
,
in
uncontrollable
drowsiness
.
*NL*
But
the
watchfulness
of
these
vigilant
protectors
neither
tired
nor
*NL*
slumbered
.
Immovable
as
that
rock
,
of
which
each
appeared
to
form
a
*NL*
part
,
they
lay
,
with
their
eyes
roving
,
without
intermission
,
along
the
*NL*
dark
margin
of
trees
,
that
bounded
the
adjacent
shores
of
the
narrow
*NL*
stream
.
Not
a
sound
escaped
them
;
the
most
subtle
examination
could
*NL*
not
have
told
they
breathed
.
It
was
evident
that
this
excess
of
caution
*NL*
proceeded
from
an
experience
that
no
subtlety
on
the
part
of
their
*NL*
enemies
could
deceive
.
It
was
,
however
,
continued
without
any
apparent
*NL*
consequences
,
until
the
moon
had
set
,
and
a
pale
streak
above
the
*NL*
treetops
,
at
the
bend
of
the
river
a
little
below
,
announced
the
*NL*
approach
of
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
for
the
first
time
,
Hawkeye
was
seen
to
stir
.
He
crawled
along
the
*NL*
rock
and
shook
Duncan
from
his
heavy
slumbers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
is
the
time
to
journey
,
''
he
whispered
;
``
awake
the
gentle
ones
,
and
*NL*
be
ready
to
get
into
the
canoe
when
I
bring
it
to
the
landing-place
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
had
a
quiet
night
?
''
said
Heyward
;
``
for
myself
,
I
believe
sleep
*NL*
has
got
the
better
of
my
vigilance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
is
yet
still
as
midnight
.
Be
silent
,
but
be
quick
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
By
this
time
Duncan
was
thoroughly
awake
,
and
he
immediately
lifted
the
*NL*
shawl
from
the
sleeping
females
.
The
motion
caused
Cora
to
raise
her
*NL*
hand
as
if
to
repulse
him
,
while
Alice
murmured
,
in
her
soft
,
gentle
*NL*
voice
,
``
No
,
no
,
dear
father
,
we
were
not
deserted
;
Duncan
was
with
us
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sweet
innocence
,
''
whispered
the
youth
;
``
Duncan
is
here
,
and
while
*NL*
life
continues
or
danger
remains
,
he
will
never
quit
thee
.
Cora
!
Alice
!
*NL*
awake
!
The
hour
has
come
to
move
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
loud
shriek
from
the
younger
of
the
sisters
,
and
the
form
of
the
other
*NL*
standing
upright
before
him
,
in
bewildered
horror
,
was
the
unexpected
*NL*
answer
he
received
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
the
words
were
still
on
the
lips
of
Heyward
,
there
had
arisen
such
*NL*
a
tumult
of
yells
and
cries
as
served
to
drive
the
swift
currents
of
his
*NL*
own
blood
back
from
its
bounding
course
into
the
fountains
of
his
heart
.
*NL*
It
seemed
,
for
near
a
minute
,
as
if
the
demons
of
hell
had
possessed
*NL*
themselves
of
the
air
about
them
,
and
were
venting
their
savage
humors
*NL*
in
barbarous
sounds
.
The
cries
came
from
no
particular
direction
,
though
*NL*
it
was
evident
they
filled
the
woods
,
and
,
as
the
appalled
listeners
*NL*
easily
imagined
,
the
caverns
of
the
falls
,
the
rocks
,
the
bed
of
the
*NL*
river
,
and
the
upper
air
.
David
raised
his
tall
person
in
the
midst
of
*NL*
the
infernal
din
,
with
a
hand
on
either
ear
,
exclaiming
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whence
comes
this
discord
!
Has
hell
broke
loose
,
that
man
should
utter
*NL*
sounds
like
these
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
bright
flashes
and
the
quick
reports
of
a
dozen
rifles
,
from
the
*NL*
opposite
banks
of
the
stream
,
followed
this
incautious
exposure
of
his
*NL*
person
,
and
left
the
unfortunate
singing
master
senseless
on
that
rock
*NL*
where
he
had
been
so
long
slumbering
.
The
Mohicans
boldly
sent
back
the
*NL*
intimidating
yell
of
their
enemies
,
who
raised
a
shout
of
savage
triumph
*NL*
at
the
fall
of
Gamut
.
The
flash
of
rifles
was
then
quick
and
close
*NL*
between
them
,
but
either
party
was
too
well
skilled
to
leave
even
a
limb
*NL*
exposed
to
the
hostile
aim
.
Duncan
listened
with
intense
anxiety
for
the
*NL*
strokes
of
the
paddle
,
believing
that
flight
was
now
their
only
refuge
.
*NL*
The
river
glanced
by
with
its
ordinary
velocity
,
but
the
canoe
was
*NL*
nowhere
to
be
seen
on
its
dark
waters
.
He
had
just
fancied
they
were
*NL*
cruelly
deserted
by
their
scout
,
as
a
stream
of
flame
issued
from
the
*NL*
rock
beneath
them
,
and
a
fierce
yell
,
blended
with
a
shriek
of
agony
,
*NL*
announced
that
the
messenger
of
death
sent
from
the
fatal
weapon
of
*NL*
Hawkeye
,
had
found
a
victim
.
At
this
slight
repulse
the
assailants
*NL*
instantly
withdrew
,
and
gradually
the
place
became
as
still
as
before
*NL*
the
sudden
tumult
.
*NL*
*NL*
Duncan
seized
the
favorable
moment
to
spring
to
the
body
of
Gamut
,
*NL*
which
he
bore
within
the
shelter
of
the
narrow
chasm
that
protected
the
*NL*
sisters
.
In
another
minute
the
whole
party
was
collected
in
this
spot
of
*NL*
comparative
safety
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
poor
fellow
has
saved
his
scalp
,
''
said
Hawkeye
,
coolly
passing
his
*NL*
hand
over
the
head
of
David
;
``
but
he
is
a
proof
that
a
man
may
be
born
*NL*
with
too
long
a
tongue
!
'T
was
downright
madness
to
show
six
feet
of
*NL*
flesh
and
blood
,
on
a
naked
rock
,
to
the
raging
savages
.
I
only
wonder
*NL*
he
has
escaped
with
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
he
not
dead
?
''
demanded
Cora
,
in
a
voice
whose
husky
tones
showed
how
*NL*
powerfully
natural
horror
struggled
with
her
assumed
firmness
.
``
Can
we
*NL*
do
aught
to
assist
the
wretched
man
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
!
the
life
is
in
his
heart
yet
,
and
after
he
has
slept
awhile
he
*NL*
will
come
to
himself
,
and
be
a
wiser
man
for
it
,
till
the
hour
of
his
*NL*
real
time
shall
come
,
''
returned
Hawkeye
,
casting
another
oblique
glance
*NL*
at
the
insensible
body
,
while
he
filled
his
charger
with
admirable
*NL*
nicety
.
``
Carry
him
in
,
Uncas
,
and
lay
him
on
the
sassafras
.
The
longer
*NL*
his
nap
lasts
the
better
it
will
be
for
him
,
as
I
doubt
whether
he
can
*NL*
find
a
proper
cover
for
such
a
shape
on
these
rocks
;
and
singing
wo
n't
*NL*
do
any
good
with
the
Iroquois
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
believe
,
then
,
the
attack
will
be
renewed
?
''
asked
Heyward
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
I
expect
a
hungry
wolf
will
satisfy
his
craving
with
a
mouthful
!
*NL*
They
have
lost
a
man
,
and
't
is
their
fashion
,
when
they
meet
a
loss
,
*NL*
and
fail
in
the
surprise
,
to
fall
back
;
but
we
shall
have
them
on
again
,
*NL*
with
new
expedients
to
circumvent
us
,
and
master
our
scalps
.
Our
main
*NL*
hope
,
''
he
continued
,
raising
his
rugged
countenance
,
across
which
a
*NL*
shade
of
anxiety
just
then
passed
like
a
darkening
cloud
,
``
will
be
to
*NL*
keep
the
rock
until
Munro
can
send
a
party
to
our
help
!
God
send
it
may
*NL*
be
soon
and
under
a
leader
that
knows
the
Indian
customs
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
hear
our
probable
fortunes
,
Cora
,
''
said
Duncan
,
``
and
you
know
we
*NL*
have
everything
to
hope
from
the
anxiety
and
experience
of
your
father
.
*NL*
Come
,
then
,
with
Alice
,
into
this
cavern
,
where
you
,
at
least
,
will
be
*NL*
safe
from
the
murderous
rifles
of
our
enemies
,
and
where
you
may
bestow
*NL*
a
care
suited
to
your
gentle
natures
on
our
unfortunate
comrade
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
sisters
followed
him
into
the
outer
cave
,
where
David
was
beginning
,
*NL*
by
his
sighs
,
to
give
symptoms
of
returning
consciousness
,
and
then
*NL*
commending
the
wounded
man
to
their
attention
,
he
immediately
prepared
*NL*
to
leave
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Duncan
!
''
said
the
tremulous
voice
of
Cora
,
when
he
had
reached
the
*NL*
mouth
of
the
cavern
.
He
turned
and
beheld
the
speaker
,
whose
color
had
*NL*
changed
to
a
deadly
paleness
,
and
whose
lips
quivered
,
gazing
after
him
,
*NL*
with
an
expression
of
interest
which
immediately
recalled
him
to
her
*NL*
side
.
``
Remember
,
Duncan
,
how
necessary
your
safety
is
to
our
own
--
how
*NL*
you
bear
a
father
's
sacred
trust
--
how
much
depends
on
your
discretion
*NL*
and
care
--
in
short
,
''
she
added
,
while
the
telltale
blood
stole
over
her
*NL*
features
,
crimsoning
her
very
temples
,
``
how
very
deservedly
dear
you
are
*NL*
to
all
of
the
name
of
Munro
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
anything
could
add
to
my
own
base
love
of
life
,
''
said
Heyward
,
*NL*
suffering
his
unconscious
eyes
to
wander
to
the
youthful
form
of
*NL*
the
silent
Alice
,
``
it
would
be
so
kind
an
assurance
.
As
major
of
the
*NL*
Sixtieth
,
our
honest
host
will
tell
you
I
must
take
my
share
of
the
*NL*
fray
;
but
our
task
will
be
easy
;
it
is
merely
to
keep
these
blood-hounds
*NL*
at
bay
for
a
few
hours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Without
waiting
for
a
reply
,
he
tore
himself
from
the
presence
of
the
*NL*
sisters
,
and
joined
the
scout
and
his
companions
,
who
still
lay
within
*NL*
the
protection
of
the
little
chasm
between
the
two
caves
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
tell
you
,
Uncas
,
''
said
the
former
,
as
Heyward
joined
them
,
``
you
are
*NL*
wasteful
of
your
powder
,
and
the
kick
of
the
rifle
disconcerts
your
aim
!
*NL*
Little
powder
,
light
lead
,
and
a
long
arm
,
seldom
fail
of
bringing
the
*NL*
death
screech
from
a
Mingo
!
At
least
,
such
has
been
my
experience
with
*NL*
the
creatur
's
.
Come
,
friends
:
let
us
to
our
covers
,
for
no
man
can
tell
*NL*
when
or
where
a
Maqua
*
will
strike
his
blow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*
Mingo
was
the
Delaware
term
of
the
Five
Nations
.
Maquas
*NL*
was
the
name
given
them
by
the
Dutch
.
The
French
,
from
their
*NL*
first
intercourse
with
them
,
called
them
Iroquois
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Indians
silently
repaired
to
their
appointed
stations
,
which
were
*NL*
fissures
in
the
rocks
,
whence
they
could
command
the
approaches
to
the
*NL*
foot
of
the
falls
.
In
the
center
of
the
little
island
,
a
few
short
and
*NL*
stunted
pines
had
found
root
,
forming
a
thicket
,
into
which
Hawkeye
*NL*
darted
with
the
swiftness
of
a
deer
,
followed
by
the
active
Duncan
.
Here
*NL*
they
secured
themselves
,
as
well
as
circumstances
would
permit
,
among
*NL*
the
shrubs
and
fragments
of
stone
that
were
scattered
about
the
place
.
*NL*
Above
them
was
a
bare
,
rounded
rock
,
on
each
side
of
which
the
water
*NL*
played
its
gambols
,
and
plunged
into
the
abysses
beneath
,
in
the
manner
*NL*
already
described
.
As
the
day
had
now
dawned
,
the
opposite
shores
no
*NL*
longer
presented
a
confused
outline
,
but
they
were
able
to
look
into
the
*NL*
woods
,
and
distinguish
objects
beneath
a
canopy
of
gloomy
pines
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
long
and
anxious
watch
succeeded
,
but
without
any
further
evidences
*NL*
of
a
renewed
attack
;
and
Duncan
began
to
hope
that
their
fire
had
*NL*
proved
more
fatal
than
was
supposed
,
and
that
their
enemies
had
been
*NL*
effectually
repulsed
.
When
he
ventured
to
utter
this
impression
to
his
*NL*
companions
,
it
was
met
by
Hawkeye
with
an
incredulous
shake
of
the
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
not
the
nature
of
a
Maqua
,
if
you
think
he
is
so
easily
*NL*
beaten
back
without
a
scalp
!
''
he
answered
.
``
If
there
was
one
of
the
imps
*NL*
yelling
this
morning
,
there
were
forty
!
and
they
know
our
number
and
*NL*
quality
too
well
to
give
up
the
chase
so
soon
.
Hist
!
look
into
the
water
*NL*
above
,
just
where
it
breaks
over
the
rocks
.
I
am
no
mortal
,
if
the
risky
*NL*
devils
have
n't
swam
down
upon
the
very
pitch
,
and
,
as
bad
luck
would
*NL*
have
it
,
they
have
hit
the
head
of
the
island
.
Hist
!
man
,
keep
close
!
or
*NL*
the
hair
will
be
off
your
crown
in
the
turning
of
a
knife
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Heyward
lifted
his
head
from
the
cover
,
and
beheld
what
he
justly
*NL*
considered
a
prodigy
of
rashness
and
skill
.
The
river
had
worn
away
the
*NL*
edge
of
the
soft
rock
in
such
a
manner
as
to
render
its
first
pitch
*NL*
less
abrupt
and
perpendicular
than
is
usual
at
waterfalls
.
With
no
other
*NL*
guide
than
the
ripple
of
the
stream
where
it
met
the
head
of
the
island
,
*NL*
a
party
of
their
insatiable
foes
had
ventured
into
the
current
,
and
*NL*
swam
down
upon
this
point
,
knowing
the
ready
access
it
would
give
,
if
*NL*
successful
,
to
their
intended
victims
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
Hawkeye
ceased
speaking
,
four
human
heads
could
be
seen
peering
above
*NL*
a
few
logs
of
drift-wood
that
had
lodged
on
these
naked
rocks
,
and
which
*NL*
had
probably
suggested
the
idea
of
the
practicability
of
the
hazardous
*NL*
undertaking
.
At
the
next
moment
,
a
fifth
form
was
seen
floating
over
the
*NL*
green
edge
of
the
fall
,
a
little
from
the
line
of
the
island
.
The
savage
*NL*
struggled
powerfully
to
gain
the
point
of
safety
,
and
,
favored
by
the
*NL*
glancing
water
,
he
was
already
stretching
forth
an
arm
to
meet
the
grasp
*NL*
of
his
companions
,
when
he
shot
away
again
with
the
shirling
current
,
*NL*
appeared
to
rise
into
the
air
,
with
uplifted
arms
and
starting
eyeballs
,
*NL*
and
fell
,
with
a
sudden
plunge
,
into
that
deep
and
yawning
abyss
over
*NL*
which
he
hovered
.
A
single
,
wild
,
despairing
shriek
rose
from
the
*NL*
cavern
,
and
all
was
hushed
again
as
the
grave
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
generous
impulse
of
Duncan
was
to
rush
to
the
rescue
of
the
*NL*
hapless
wretch
;
but
he
felt
himself
bound
to
the
spot
by
the
iron
grasp
*NL*
of
the
immovable
scout
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
ye
bring
certain
death
upon
us
,
by
telling
the
Mingoes
where
we
*NL*
lie
?
''
demanded
Hawkeye
,
sternly
;
''
'T
is
a
charge
of
powder
saved
,
and
*NL*
ammunition
is
as
precious
now
as
breath
to
a
worried
deer
!
Freshen
the
*NL*
priming
of
your
pistols
--
the
midst
of
the
falls
is
apt
to
dampen
the
*NL*
brimstone
--
and
stand
firm
for
a
close
struggle
,
while
I
fire
on
their
*NL*
rush
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
placed
a
finger
in
his
mouth
,
and
drew
a
long
,
shrill
whistle
,
which
*NL*
was
answered
from
the
rocks
that
were
guarded
by
the
Mohicans
.
Duncan
*NL*
caught
glimpses
of
heads
above
the
scattered
drift-wood
,
as
this
signal
*NL*
rose
on
the
air
,
but
they
disappeared
again
as
suddenly
as
they
had
*NL*
glanced
upon
his
sight
.
A
low
,
rustling
sound
next
drew
his
attention
*NL*
behind
him
,
and
turning
his
head
,
he
beheld
Uncas
within
a
few
feet
,
*NL*
creeping
to
his
side
.
Hawkeye
spoke
to
him
in
Delaware
,
when
the
young
*NL*
chief
took
his
position
with
singular
caution
and
undisturbed
coolness
.
*NL*
To
Heyward
this
was
a
moment
of
feverish
and
impatient
suspense
;
though
*NL*
the
scout
saw
fit
to
select
it
as
a
fit
occasion
to
read
a
lecture
*NL*
to
his
more
youthful
associates
on
the
art
of
using
firearms
with
*NL*
discretion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
all
we
`
pons
,
''
he
commenced
,
``
the
long
barreled
,
true-grooved
,
*NL*
soft-metaled
rifle
is
the
most
dangerous
in
skillful
hands
,
though
it
*NL*
wants
a
strong
arm
,
a
quick
eye
,
and
great
judgment
in
charging
,
to
put
*NL*
forth
all
its
beauties
.
The
gunsmiths
can
have
but
little
insight
into
*NL*
their
trade
when
they
make
their
fowling-pieces
and
short
horsemen
's
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
interrupted
by
the
low
but
expressive
``
hugh
''
of
Uncas
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
them
,
boy
,
I
see
them
!
''
continued
Hawkeye
;
``
they
are
gathering
*NL*
for
the
rush
,
or
they
would
keep
their
dingy
backs
below
the
logs
.
Well
,
*NL*
let
them
,
''
he
added
,
examining
his
flint
;
``
the
leading
man
certainly
*NL*
comes
on
to
his
death
,
though
it
should
be
Montcalm
himself
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
the
woods
were
filled
with
another
burst
of
cries
,
and
at
*NL*
the
signal
four
savages
sprang
from
the
cover
of
the
driftwood
.
Heyward
*NL*
felt
a
burning
desire
to
rush
forward
to
meet
them
,
so
intense
was
the
*NL*
delirious
anxiety
of
the
moment
;
but
he
was
restrained
by
the
deliberate
*NL*
examples
of
the
scout
and
Uncas
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
their
foes
,
who
had
leaped
over
the
black
rocks
that
divided
them
,
*NL*
with
long
bounds
,
uttering
the
wildest
yells
,
were
within
a
few
rods
,
*NL*
the
rifle
of
Hawkeye
slowly
rose
among
the
shrubs
,
and
poured
out
its
*NL*
fatal
contents
.
The
foremost
Indian
bounded
like
a
stricken
deer
,
and
*NL*
fell
headlong
among
the
clefts
of
the
island
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Uncas
!
''
cried
the
scout
,
drawing
his
long
knife
,
while
his
quick
*NL*
eyes
began
to
flash
with
ardor
,
``
take
the
last
of
the
screeching
imps
;
*NL*
of
the
other
two
we
are
sartain
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
obeyed
;
and
but
two
enemies
remained
to
be
overcome
.
Heyward
had
*NL*
given
one
of
his
pistols
to
Hawkeye
,
and
together
they
rushed
down
a
*NL*
little
declivity
toward
their
foes
;
they
discharged
their
weapons
at
the
*NL*
same
instant
,
and
equally
without
success
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
'd
it
!
and
I
said
it
!
''
muttered
the
scout
,
whirling
the
despised
*NL*
little
implement
over
the
falls
with
bitter
disdain
.
``
Come
on
,
ye
bloody
*NL*
minded
hell-hounds
!
ye
meet
a
man
without
a
cross
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
words
were
barely
uttered
,
when
he
encountered
a
savage
of
gigantic
*NL*
stature
,
of
the
fiercest
mien
.
At
the
same
moment
,
Duncan
found
himself
*NL*
engaged
with
the
other
,
in
a
similar
contest
of
hand
to
hand
.
With
ready
*NL*
skill
,
Hawkeye
and
his
antagonist
each
grasped
that
uplifted
arm
of
*NL*
the
other
which
held
the
dangerous
knife
.
For
near
a
minute
they
stood
*NL*
looking
one
another
in
the
eye
,
and
gradually
exerting
the
power
of
*NL*
their
muscles
for
the
mastery
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
,
the
toughened
sinews
of
the
white
man
prevailed
over
the
less
*NL*
practiced
limbs
of
the
native
.
The
arm
of
the
latter
slowly
gave
way
*NL*
before
the
increasing
force
of
the
scout
,
who
,
suddenly
wresting
his
*NL*
armed
hand
from
the
grasp
of
the
foe
,
drove
the
sharp
weapon
through
his
*NL*
naked
bosom
to
the
heart
.
In
the
meantime
,
Heyward
had
been
pressed
in
*NL*
a
more
deadly
struggle
.
His
slight
sword
was
snapped
in
the
first
*NL*
encounter
.
As
he
was
destitute
of
any
other
means
of
defense
,
his
*NL*
safety
now
depended
entirely
on
bodily
strength
and
resolution
.
Though
*NL*
deficient
in
neither
of
these
qualities
,
he
had
met
an
enemy
every
way
*NL*
his
equal
.
Happily
,
he
soon
succeeded
in
disarming
his
adversary
,
whose
*NL*
knife
fell
on
the
rock
at
their
feet
;
and
from
this
moment
it
became
a
*NL*
fierce
struggle
who
should
cast
the
other
over
the
dizzy
height
into
a
*NL*
neighboring
cavern
of
the
falls
.
Every
successive
struggle
brought
them
*NL*
nearer
to
the
verge
,
where
Duncan
perceived
the
final
and
conquering
*NL*
effort
must
be
made
.
Each
of
the
combatants
threw
all
his
energies
into
*NL*
that
effort
,
and
the
result
was
,
that
both
tottered
on
the
brink
of
the
*NL*
precipice
.
Heyward
felt
the
grasp
of
the
other
at
his
throat
,
and
*NL*
saw
the
grim
smile
the
savage
gave
,
under
the
revengeful
hope
that
he
*NL*
hurried
his
enemy
to
a
fate
similar
to
his
own
,
as
he
felt
his
body
*NL*
slowly
yielding
to
a
resistless
power
,
and
the
young
man
experienced
the
*NL*
passing
agony
of
such
a
moment
in
all
its
horrors
.
At
that
instant
of
*NL*
extreme
danger
,
a
dark
hand
and
glancing
knife
appeared
before
him
;
the
*NL*
Indian
released
his
hold
,
as
the
blood
flowed
freely
from
around
the
*NL*
severed
tendons
of
the
wrist
;
and
while
Duncan
was
drawn
backward
by
the
*NL*
saving
hand
of
Uncas
,
his
charmed
eyes
still
were
riveted
on
the
*NL*
fierce
and
disappointed
countenance
of
his
foe
,
who
fell
sullenly
and
*NL*
disappointed
down
the
irrecoverable
precipice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
cover
!
to
cover
!
''
cried
Hawkeye
,
who
just
then
had
despatched
the
*NL*
enemy
;
``
to
cover
,
for
your
lives
!
the
work
is
but
half
ended
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
Mohican
gave
a
shout
of
triumph
,
and
followed
by
Duncan
,
he
*NL*
glided
up
the
acclivity
they
had
descended
to
the
combat
,
and
sought
the
*NL*
friendly
shelter
of
the
rocks
and
shrubs
.

CHAPTER

*NL*
``
They

*NL*
Avengers

''
--
Gray
*NL*
*NL*
The
warning
call
of
the
scout
was
not
uttered
without
occasion
.
During
*NL*
the
occurrence
of
the
deadly
encounter
just
related
,
the
roar
of
the
*NL*
falls
was
unbroken
by
any
human
sound
whatever
.
It
would
seem
that
*NL*
interest
in
the
result
had
kept
the
natives
on
the
opposite
shores
in
*NL*
breathless
suspense
,
while
the
quick
evolutions
and
swift
changes
in
*NL*
the
positions
of
the
combatants
effectually
prevented
a
fire
that
might
*NL*
prove
dangerous
alike
to
friend
and
enemy
.
But
the
moment
the
struggle
*NL*
was
decided
,
a
yell
arose
as
fierce
and
savage
as
wild
and
revengeful
*NL*
passions
could
throw
into
the
air
.
It
was
followed
by
the
swift
flashes
*NL*
of
the
rifles
,
which
sent
their
leaden
messengers
across
the
rock
in
*NL*
volleys
,
as
though
the
assailants
would
pour
out
their
impotent
fury
on
*NL*
the
insensible
scene
of
the
fatal
contest
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
steady
,
though
deliberate
return
was
made
from
the
rifle
of
*NL*
Chingachgook
,
who
had
maintained
his
post
throughout
the
fray
with
*NL*
unmoved
resolution
.
When
the
triumphant
shout
of
Uncas
was
borne
to
his
*NL*
ears
,
the
gratified
father
raised
his
voice
in
a
single
responsive
cry
,
*NL*
after
which
his
busy
piece
alone
proved
that
he
still
guarded
his
pass
*NL*
with
unwearied
diligence
.
In
this
manner
many
minutes
flew
by
with
the
*NL*
swiftness
of
thought
;
the
rifles
of
the
assailants
speaking
,
at
times
,
*NL*
in
rattling
volleys
,
and
at
others
in
occasional
,
scattering
shots
.
*NL*
Though
the
rock
,
the
trees
,
and
the
shrubs
,
were
cut
and
torn
in
a
*NL*
hundred
places
around
the
besieged
,
their
cover
was
so
close
,
and
so
*NL*
rigidly
maintained
,
that
,
as
yet
,
David
had
been
the
only
sufferer
in
*NL*
their
little
band
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
them
burn
their
powder
,
''
said
the
deliberate
scout
,
while
bullet
*NL*
after
bullet
whizzed
by
the
place
where
he
securely
lay
;
``
there
will
be
*NL*
a
fine
gathering
of
lead
when
it
is
over
,
and
I
fancy
the
imps
will
tire
*NL*
of
the
sport
afore
these
old
stones
cry
out
for
mercy
!
Uncas
,
boy
,
you
*NL*
waste
the
kernels
by
overcharging
;
and
a
kicking
rifle
never
carries
a
*NL*
true
bullet
.
I
told
you
to
take
that
loping
miscreant
under
the
line
*NL*
of
white
point
;
now
,
if
your
bullet
went
a
hair
's
breadth
it
went
two
*NL*
inches
above
it
.
The
life
lies
low
in
a
Mingo
,
and
humanity
teaches
us
*NL*
to
make
a
quick
end
to
the
sarpents
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
quiet
smile
lighted
the
haughty
features
of
the
young
Mohican
,
*NL*
betraying
his
knowledge
of
the
English
language
as
well
as
of
the
*NL*
other
's
meaning
;
but
he
suffered
it
to
pass
away
without
vindication
of
*NL*
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
permit
you
to
accuse
Uncas
of
want
of
judgment
or
of
skill
,
''
*NL*
said
Duncan
;
``
he
saved
my
life
in
the
coolest
and
readiest
manner
,
and
*NL*
he
has
made
a
friend
who
never
will
require
to
be
reminded
of
the
debt
*NL*
he
owes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Uncas
partly
raised
his
body
,
and
offered
his
hand
to
the
grasp
of
*NL*
Heyward
.
During
this
act
of
friendship
,
the
two
young
men
exchanged
*NL*
looks
of
intelligence
which
caused
Duncan
to
forget
the
character
and
*NL*
condition
of
his
wild
associate
.
In
the
meanwhile
,
Hawkeye
,
who
looked
*NL*
on
this
burst
of
youthful
feeling
with
a
cool
but
kind
regard
made
the
*NL*
following
reply
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Life
is
an
obligation
which
friends
often
owe
each
other
in
the
*NL*
wilderness
.
I
dare
say
I
may
have
served
Uncas
some
such
turn
myself
*NL*
before
now
;
and
I
very
well
remember
that
he
has
stood
between
me
*NL*
and
death
five
different
times
;
three
times
from
the
Mingoes
,
once
in
*NL*
crossing
Horican
,
and
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
bullet
was
better
aimed
than
common
!
''
exclaimed
Duncan
,
*NL*
involuntarily
shrinking
from
a
shot
which
struck
the
rock
at
his
side
*NL*
with
a
smart
rebound
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hawkeye
laid
his
hand
on
the
shapeless
metal
,
and
shook
his
head
,
as
he
*NL*
examined
it
,
saying
,
``
Falling
lead
is
never
flattened
,
had
it
come
from
*NL*
the
clouds
this
might
have
happened
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
rifle
of
Uncas
was
deliberately
raised
toward
the
heavens
,
*NL*
directing
the
eyes
of
his
companions
to
a
point
,
where
the
mystery
was
*NL*
immediately
explained
.
A
ragged
oak
grew
on
the
right
bank
of
the
river
,
*NL*
nearly
opposite
to
their
position
,
which
,
seeking
the
freedom
of
the
*NL*
open
space
,
had
inclined
so
far
forward
that
its
upper
branches
overhung
*NL*
that
arm
of
the
stream
which
flowed
nearest
to
its
own
shore
.
Among
the
*NL*
topmost
leaves
,
which
scantily
concealed
the
gnarled
and
stunted
limbs
,
*NL*
a
savage
was
nestled
,
partly
concealed
by
the
trunk
of
the
tree
,
and
*NL*
partly
exposed
,
as
though
looking
down
upon
them
to
ascertain
the
effect
*NL*
produced
by
his
treacherous
aim
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
These
devils
will
scale
heaven
to
circumvent
us
to
our
ruin
,
''
said
*NL*
Hawkeye
;
``
keep
him
in
play
,
boy
,
until
I
can
bring
`
killdeer
'
to
bear
,
*NL*
when
we
will
try
his
metal
on
each
side
of
the
tree
at
once
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Uncas
delayed
his
fire
until
the
scout
uttered
the
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
rifles
flashed
,
the
leaves
and
bark
of
the
oak
flew
into
the
air
,
*NL*
and
were
scattered
by
the
wind
,
but
the
Indian
answered
their
assault
by
*NL*
a
taunting
laugh
,
sending
down
upon
them
another
bullet
in
return
,
that
*NL*
struck
the
cap
of
Hawkeye
from
his
head
.
Once
more
the
savage
yells
*NL*
burst
out
of
the
woods
,
and
the
leaden
hail
whistled
above
the
heads
of
*NL*
the
besieged
,
as
if
to
confine
them
to
a
place
where
they
might
become
*NL*
easy
victims
to
the
enterprise
of
the
warrior
who
had
mounted
the
tree
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
must
be
looked
to
,
''
said
the
scout
,
glancing
about
him
with
*NL*
an
anxious
eye
.
``
Uncas
,
call
up
your
father
;
we
have
need
of
all
our
*NL*
we
`
pons
to
bring
the
cunning
varmint
from
his
roost
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
signal
was
instantly
given
;
and
,
before
Hawkeye
had
reloaded
his
*NL*
rifle
,
they
were
joined
by
Chingachgook
.
When
his
son
pointed
out
to
the
*NL*
experienced
warrior
the
situation
of
their
dangerous
enemy
,
the
*NL*
usual
exclamatory
``
hugh
''
burst
from
his
lips
;
after
which
,
no
further
*NL*
expression
of
surprise
or
alarm
was
suffered
to
escape
him
.
Hawkeye
and
*NL*
the
Mohicans
conversed
earnestly
together
in
Delaware
for
a
few
moments
,
*NL*
when
each
quietly
took
his
post
,
in
order
to
execute
the
plan
they
had
*NL*
speedily
devised
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
warrior
in
the
oak
had
maintained
a
quick
,
though
ineffectual
fire
,
*NL*
from
the
moment
of
his
discovery
.
But
his
aim
was
interrupted
by
the
*NL*
vigilance
of
his
enemies
,
whose
rifles
instantaneously
bore
on
any
*NL*
part
of
his
person
that
was
left
exposed
.
Still
his
bullets
fell
in
the
*NL*
center
of
the
crouching
party
.
The
clothes
of
Heyward
,
which
rendered
*NL*
him
peculiarly
conspicuous
,
were
repeatedly
cut
,
and
once
blood
was
*NL*
drawn
from
a
slight
wound
in
his
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
,
emboldened
by
the
long
and
patient
watchfulness
of
his
*NL*
enemies
,
the
Huron
attempted
a
better
and
more
fatal
aim
.
The
quick
eyes
*NL*
of
the
Mohicans
caught
the
dark
line
of
his
lower
limbs
incautiously
*NL*
exposed
through
the
thin
foliage
,
a
few
inches
from
the
trunk
of
the
*NL*
tree
.
Their
rifles
made
a
common
report
,
when
,
sinking
on
his
wounded
*NL*
limb
,
part
of
the
body
of
the
savage
came
into
view
.
Swift
as
thought
,
*NL*
Hawkeye
seized
the
advantage
,
and
discharged
his
fatal
weapon
into
the
*NL*
top
of
the
oak
.
The
leaves
were
unusually
agitated
;
the
dangerous
rifle
*NL*
fell
from
its
commanding
elevation
,
and
after
a
few
moments
of
vain
*NL*
struggling
,
the
form
of
the
savage
was
seen
swinging
in
the
wind
,
*NL*
while
he
still
grasped
a
ragged
and
naked
branch
of
the
tree
with
hands
*NL*
clenched
in
desperation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
him
,
in
pity
,
give
him
the
contents
of
another
rifle
,
''
cried
*NL*
Duncan
,
turning
away
his
eyes
in
horror
from
the
spectacle
of
a
fellow
*NL*
creature
in
such
awful
jeopardy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
a
karnel
!
''
exclaimed
the
obdurate
Hawkeye
;
``
his
death
is
certain
,
*NL*
and
we
have
no
powder
to
spare
,
for
Indian
fights
sometimes
last
for
*NL*
days
;
't
is
their
scalps
or
ours
!
and
God
,
who
made
us
,
has
put
into
our
*NL*
natures
the
craving
to
keep
the
skin
on
the
head
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Against
this
stern
and
unyielding
morality
,
supported
as
it
was
by
such
*NL*
visible
policy
,
there
was
no
appeal
.
From
that
moment
the
yells
in
the
*NL*
forest
once
more
ceased
,
the
fire
was
suffered
to
decline
,
and
all
*NL*
eyes
,
those
of
friends
as
well
as
enemies
,
became
fixed
on
the
hopeless
*NL*
condition
of
the
wretch
who
was
dangling
between
heaven
and
earth
.
*NL*
The
body
yielded
to
the
currents
of
air
,
and
though
no
murmur
or
groan
*NL*
escaped
the
victim
,
there
were
instants
when
he
grimly
faced
his
foes
,
*NL*
and
the
anguish
of
cold
despair
might
be
traced
,
through
the
intervening
*NL*
distance
,
in
possession
of
his
swarthy
lineaments
.
Three
several
times
*NL*
the
scout
raised
his
piece
in
mercy
,
and
as
often
,
prudence
getting
the
*NL*
better
of
his
intention
,
it
was
again
silently
lowered
.
At
length
one
*NL*
hand
of
the
Huron
lost
its
hold
,
and
dropped
exhausted
to
his
side
.
A
*NL*
desperate
and
fruitless
struggle
to
recover
the
branch
succeeded
,
and
*NL*
then
the
savage
was
seen
for
a
fleeting
instant
,
grasping
wildly
at
*NL*
the
empty
air
.
The
lightning
is
not
quicker
than
was
the
flame
from
the
*NL*
rifle
of
Hawkeye
;
the
limbs
of
the
victim
trembled
and
contracted
,
the
*NL*
head
fell
to
the
bosom
,
and
the
body
parted
the
foaming
waters
like
*NL*
lead
,
when
the
element
closed
above
it
,
in
its
ceaseless
velocity
,
and
*NL*
every
vestige
of
the
unhappy
Huron
was
lost
forever
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
shout
of
triumph
succeeded
this
important
advantage
,
but
even
the
*NL*
Mohicans
gazed
at
each
other
in
silent
horror
.
A
single
yell
burst
*NL*
from
the
woods
,
and
all
was
again
still
.
Hawkeye
,
who
alone
appeared
to
*NL*
reason
on
the
occasion
,
shook
his
head
at
his
own
momentary
weakness
,
*NL*
even
uttering
his
self-disapprobation
aloud
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
was
the
last
charge
in
my
horn
and
the
last
bullet
in
my
pouch
,
and
*NL*
't
was
the
act
of
a
boy
!
''
he
said
;
``
what
mattered
it
whether
he
struck
*NL*
the
rock
living
or
dead
!
feeling
would
soon
be
over
.
Uncas
,
lad
,
go
down
*NL*
to
the
canoe
,
and
bring
up
the
big
horn
;
it
is
all
the
powder
we
have
*NL*
left
,
and
we
shall
need
it
to
the
last
grain
,
or
I
am
ignorant
of
the
*NL*
Mingo
nature
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
Mohican
complied
,
leaving
the
scout
turning
over
the
*NL*
useless
contents
of
his
pouch
,
and
shaking
the
empty
horn
with
renewed
*NL*
discontent
.
From
this
unsatisfactory
examination
,
however
,
he
was
soon
*NL*
called
by
a
loud
and
piercing
exclamation
from
Uncas
,
that
sounded
,
*NL*
even
to
the
unpracticed
ears
of
Duncan
,
as
the
signal
of
some
new
and
*NL*
unexpected
calamity
.
Every
thought
filled
with
apprehension
for
the
*NL*
previous
treasure
he
had
concealed
in
the
cavern
,
the
young
man
started
*NL*
to
his
feet
,
totally
regardless
of
the
hazard
he
incurred
by
such
an
*NL*
exposure
.
As
if
actuated
by
a
common
impulse
,
his
movement
was
imitated
*NL*
by
his
companions
,
and
,
together
they
rushed
down
the
pass
to
the
*NL*
friendly
chasm
,
with
a
rapidity
that
rendered
the
scattering
fire
of
*NL*
their
enemies
perfectly
harmless
.
The
unwonted
cry
had
brought
the
*NL*
sisters
,
together
with
the
wounded
David
,
from
their
place
of
refuge
;
*NL*
and
the
whole
party
,
at
a
single
glance
,
was
made
acquainted
with
the
*NL*
nature
of
the
disaster
that
had
disturbed
even
the
practiced
stoicism
of
*NL*
their
youthful
Indian
protector
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
a
short
distance
from
the
rock
,
their
little
bark
was
to
be
seen
*NL*
floating
across
the
eddy
,
toward
the
swift
current
of
the
river
,
in
a
*NL*
manner
which
proved
that
its
course
was
directed
by
some
hidden
agent
.
*NL*
The
instant
this
unwelcome
sight
caught
the
eye
of
the
scout
,
his
rifle
*NL*
was
leveled
as
by
instinct
,
but
the
barrel
gave
no
answer
to
the
bright
*NL*
sparks
of
the
flint
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
too
late
,
't
is
too
late
!
''
Hawkeye
exclaimed
,
dropping
the
useless
*NL*
piece
in
bitter
disappointment
;
``
the
miscreant
has
struck
the
rapid
;
and
*NL*
had
we
powder
,
it
could
hardly
send
the
lead
swifter
than
he
now
goes
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
adventurous
Huron
raised
his
head
above
the
shelter
of
the
canoe
,
*NL*
and
,
while
it
glided
swiftly
down
the
stream
,
he
waved
his
hand
,
and
*NL*
gave
forth
the
shout
,
which
was
the
known
signal
of
success
.
His
cry
was
*NL*
answered
by
a
yell
and
a
laugh
from
the
woods
,
as
tauntingly
exulting
*NL*
as
if
fifty
demons
were
uttering
their
blasphemies
at
the
fall
of
some
*NL*
Christian
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
may
you
laugh
,
ye
children
of
the
devil
!
''
said
the
scout
,
seating
*NL*
himself
on
a
projection
of
the
rock
,
and
suffering
his
gun
to
fall
*NL*
neglected
at
his
feet
,
``
for
the
three
quickest
and
truest
rifles
in
*NL*
these
woods
are
no
better
than
so
many
stalks
of
mullein
,
or
the
last
*NL*
year
's
horns
of
a
buck
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
to
be
done
?
''
demanded
Duncan
,
losing
the
first
feeling
of
*NL*
disappointment
in
a
more
manly
desire
for
exertion
;
``
what
will
become
of
*NL*
us
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hawkeye
made
no
other
reply
than
by
passing
his
finger
around
the
crown
*NL*
of
his
head
,
in
a
manner
so
significant
,
that
none
who
witnessed
the
*NL*
action
could
mistake
its
meaning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Surely
,
surely
,
our
case
is
not
so
desperate
!
''
exclaimed
the
youth
;
*NL*
``
the
Hurons
are
not
here
;
we
may
make
good
the
caverns
,
we
may
oppose
*NL*
their
landing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
what
?
''
coolly
demanded
the
scout
.
``
The
arrows
of
Uncas
,
or
such
*NL*
tears
as
women
shed
!
No
,
no
;
you
are
young
,
and
rich
,
and
have
friends
,
*NL*
and
at
such
an
age
I
know
it
is
hard
to
die
!
But
,
''
glancing
his
eyes
at
*NL*
the
Mohicans
,
``
let
us
remember
we
are
men
without
a
cross
,
and
let
us
*NL*
teach
these
natives
of
the
forest
that
white
blood
can
run
as
freely
as
*NL*
red
,
when
the
appointed
hour
is
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Duncan
turned
quickly
in
the
direction
indicated
by
the
other
's
eyes
,
*NL*
and
read
a
confirmation
of
his
worst
apprehensions
in
the
conduct
of
the
*NL*
Indians
.
Chingachgook
,
placing
himself
in
a
dignified
posture
on
another
*NL*
fragment
of
the
rock
,
had
already
laid
aside
his
knife
and
tomahawk
,
and
*NL*
was
in
the
act
of
taking
the
eagle
's
plume
from
his
head
,
and
smoothing
*NL*
the
solitary
tuft
of
hair
in
readiness
to
perform
its
last
and
revolting
*NL*
office
.
His
countenance
was
composed
,
though
thoughtful
,
while
his
dark
,
*NL*
gleaming
eyes
were
gradually
losing
the
fierceness
of
the
combat
in
*NL*
an
expression
better
suited
to
the
change
he
expected
momentarily
to
*NL*
undergo
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Our
case
is
not
,
can
not
be
so
hopeless
!
''
said
Duncan
;
``
even
at
this
*NL*
very
moment
succor
may
be
at
hand
.
I
see
no
enemies
!
They
have
sickened
*NL*
of
a
struggle
in
which
they
risk
so
much
with
so
little
prospect
of
*NL*
gain
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
may
be
a
minute
,
or
it
may
be
an
hour
,
afore
the
wily
sarpents
steal
*NL*
upon
us
,
and
it
is
quite
in
natur
'
for
them
to
be
lying
within
hearing
*NL*
at
this
very
moment
,
''
said
Hawkeye
;
``
but
come
they
will
,
and
in
such
*NL*
a
fashion
as
will
leave
us
nothing
to
hope
!
Chingachgook
''
--
he
spoke
in
*NL*
Delaware
--
``
my
brother
,
we
have
fought
our
last
battle
together
,
and
the
*NL*
Maquas
will
triumph
in
the
death
of
the
sage
man
of
the
Mohicans
,
and
of
*NL*
the
pale
face
,
whose
eyes
can
make
night
as
day
,
and
level
the
clouds
to
*NL*
the
mists
of
the
springs
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
the
Mingo
women
go
weep
over
the
slain

''
returned
the
Indian
,
*NL*
with
characteristic
pride
and
unmoved
firmness
;
``
the
Great
Snake
of
the
*NL*
Mohicans
has
coiled
himself
in
their
wigwams
,
and
has
poisoned
their

triumph
with
the
wailings
of
children
,
whose
fathers
have
not
returned
!
*NL*
Eleven
warriors
lie
hid
from
the
graves
of
their
tribes

the
snows

have
melted
,

none
will
tell
where
to
find
them

the
tongue

Chingachgook
shall
be
silent

draw
the

knife

*NL*
whirl
the
swiftest
tomahawk

for
their
bitterest
enemy
is
in

topmost
branch
of
a
noble
trunk

call
on
the
cowards
to
*NL*
hasten
,

their
hearts
will
soften
,

they
will
change
to
women
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
They
look
among
the
fishes
for
their
dead

''
returned
the
low
,
soft
*NL*
voice
of
the
youthful
chieftain
;
``
the
Hurons
float
with
the
slimy
eels
!
*NL*
They
drop
from
the
oaks
like
fruit
that
is
ready

be
eaten

and
the
*NL*
Delawares
laugh
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
ay
,
''
muttered
the
scout
,
who
had
listened
to
this
peculiar
burst
*NL*
of
the
natives
with
deep
attention
;
``
they
have
warmed
their
Indian
*NL*
feelings
,
and
they
'll
soon
provoke

end

*NL*
As
for
me
,
who
am
of
the
whole
blood
of
the
whites
,
it
is
befitting
that
*NL*
I
should
die
as
becomes
my
color

with
no
words
of
scoffing
in
my
mouth
,
*NL*
and
without
bitterness
at
the
heart

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
die
at
all
!
''
said
Cora
,
advancing
from
the
place
where
natural
*NL*
horror
had
,
until
this
moment
,
held
her
riveted
to
the
rock
;
``
the
path
*NL*
is
open
on
every
side

fly

to
the
woods

succor

*NL*
``

woods

returned
Hawkeye
,
who
,
however
,
*NL*
immediately
added
in
his
simplicity
,
``
the
down
stream
current
,
it
is
*NL*
certain

might
soon
sweep
us
beyond
the
reach
of
their

the
*NL*
sound
of
their
voices

*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
try
the
river

Why
linger
to
add

the
number
of
the
victims

*NL*
our
merciless
enemies

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
''
repeated
the
scout
,
looking
about
him
proudly
;
``
because
it
is
*NL*
better
for
a
man
to
die
at
peace
with
himself
than
to
live
haunted
by
an
*NL*
evil
conscience
!
What
answer
could
we
give
Munro
,
when
he
asked
us
where
*NL*
and
how
we
left
his
children
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
to
him
,
and
say
that
you
left
them
with
a
message
to
hasten
to
*NL*
their
aid

returned
Cora
,
advancing
nigher
to
the
scout
in
her
generous
*NL*
ardor
;
``
that
the
Hurons
bear
them
into
the
northern
wilds
,
but
that
*NL*
by
vigilance
and
speed
they
may
yet
be
rescued
;
and
if
,
after
all
,
it
*NL*
should
please
heaven
that
his
assistance
come
too
late
,
bear
to
him

''
*NL*
she
continued
,
her
voice
gradually
lowering
,
until
it
seemed
nearly
*NL*
choked
,
``
the
love
,
the
blessings
,
the
final
prayers
of
his
daughters
,
*NL*
and
bid
him
not
mourn
their
early
fate
,
but
to
look
forward
with
humble
*NL*
confidence
to
the
Christian
's
goal
to
meet
his
children
.
''
The
hard
,
*NL*
weather-beaten
features
of
the
scout
began
to
work
,
and
when
she
had
*NL*
ended
,
he
dropped
his
chin
to
his
hand
,
like
a
man
musing
profoundly
on
*NL*
the
nature
of
the
proposal
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
reason
in
her
words
!
''
at
length
broke
from
his
compressed
*NL*
and
trembling
lips
;
``
ay
,
and
they
bear
the
spirit
of
Christianity
;
what
*NL*
might
be
right
and
proper
in
a
red-skin
,
may
be
sinful
in
a
man
who
*NL*
has
not
even
a
cross
in
blood
to
plead
for
his
ignorance
.
Chingachgook
!
*NL*
Uncas
!
hear
you
the
talk
of
the
dark-eyed
woman
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
now
spoke
in
Delaware
to
his
companions
,
and
his
address
,
though
calm
*NL*
and
deliberate
,
seemed
very
decided
.
The
elder
Mohican
heard
with
deep
*NL*
gravity
,
and
appeared
to
ponder
on
his
words
,
as
though
he
felt
the
*NL*
importance
of
their
import
.
After
a
moment
of
hesitation
,
he
waved
his
*NL*
hand
in
assent
,
and
uttered
the
English
word
``
Good
!
''
with
the
peculiar
*NL*
emphasis
of
his
people
.
Then
,
replacing
his
knife
and
tomahawk
in
his
*NL*
girdle
,
the
warrior
moved
silently
to
the
edge
of
the
rock
which
was
*NL*
most
concealed
from
the
banks
of
the
river
.
Here
he
paused
a
moment
,
*NL*
pointed
significantly
to
the
woods
below
,
and
saying
a
few
words
in
his
*NL*
own
language
,
as
if
indicating
his
intended
route
,
he
dropped
into
the
*NL*
water
,
and
sank
from
before
the
eyes
of
the
witnesses
of
his
movements
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
scout
delayed
his
departure
to
speak
to
the
generous
girl
,
whose
*NL*
breathing
became
lighter
as
she
saw
the
success
of
her
remonstrance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wisdom
is
sometimes
given
to
the
young
,
as
well
as
to
the
old
,
''
he
*NL*
said
;
``
and
what
you
have
spoken
is
wise
,
not
to
call
it
by
a
better
*NL*
word
.
If
you
are
led
into
the
woods
,
that
is
such
of
you
as
may
be
*NL*
spared
for
awhile
,
break
the
twigs
on
the
bushes
as
you
pass
,
and
make
*NL*
the
marks
of
your
trail
as
broad
as
you
can
,
when
,
if
mortal
eyes
can
*NL*
see
them
,
depend
on
having
a
friend
who
will
follow
to
the
ends
of
the
*NL*
`
arth
afore
he
desarts
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
gave
Cora
an
affectionate
shake
of
the
hand
,
lifted
his
rifle
,
*NL*
and
after
regarding
it
a
moment
with
melancholy
solicitude
,
laid
it
*NL*
carefully
aside
,
and
descended
to
the
place
where
Chingachgook
had
just
*NL*
disappeared
.
For
an
instant
he
hung
suspended
by
the
rock
,
and
looking
*NL*
about
him
,
with
a
countenance
of
peculiar
care
,
he
added
bitterly
,
``
Had
*NL*
the
powder
held
out
,
this
disgrace
could
never
have
befallen
!
''
then
,
*NL*
loosening
his
hold
,
the
water
closed
above
his
head
,
and
he
also
became
*NL*
lost
to
view
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
eyes
now
were
turned
on
Uncas
,
who
stood
leaning
against
the
ragged
*NL*
rock
,
in
immovable
composure
.
After
waiting
a
short
time
,
Cora
pointed
*NL*
down
the
river
,
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
friends
have
not
been
seen
,
and
are
now
,
most
probably
,
in
safety
.
*NL*
Is
it
not
time
for
you
to
follow
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Uncas
will
stay
,
''
the
young
Mohican
calmly
answered
in
English
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
increase
the
horror
of
our
capture
,
and
to
diminish
the
chances
of
*NL*
our
release
!
Go
,
generous
young
man
,
''
Cora
continued
,
lowering
her
*NL*
eyes
under
the
gaze
of
the
Mohican
,
and
perhaps
,
with
an
intuitive
*NL*
consciousness
of
her
power
;
``
go
to
my
father
,
as
I
have
said
,
and
be
the
*NL*
most
confidential
of
my
messengers
.
Tell
him
to
trust
you
with
the
means
*NL*
to
buy
the
freedom
of
his
daughters
.
Go
!
't
is
my
wish
,
't
is
my
prayer
,
*NL*
that
you
will
go
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
settled
,
calm
look
of
the
young
chief
changed
to
an
expression
of
*NL*
gloom
,
but
he
no
longer
hesitated
.
With
a
noiseless
step
he
crossed
the
*NL*
rock
,
and
dropped
into
the
troubled
stream
.
Hardly
a
breath
was
drawn
by
*NL*
those
he
left
behind
,
until
they
caught
a
glimpse
of
his
head
emerging
*NL*
for
air
,
far
down
the
current
,
when
he
again
sank
,
and
was
seen
no
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
sudden
and
apparently
successful
experiments
had
all
taken
place
*NL*
in
a
few
minutes
of
that
time
which
had
now
become
so
precious
.
After
*NL*
a
last
look
at
Uncas
,
Cora
turned
and
with
a
quivering
lip
,
addressed
*NL*
herself
to
Heyward
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
heard
of
your
boasted
skill
in
the
water
,
too
,
Duncan
,
''
she
*NL*
said
;
``
follow
,
then
,
the
wise
example
set
you
by
these
simple
and
*NL*
faithful
beings
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
such
the
faith
that
Cora
Munro
would
exact
from
her
protector
?
''
said
*NL*
the
young
man
,
smiling
mournfully
,
but
with
bitterness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
not
a
time
for
idle
subtleties
and
false
opinions
,
''
she
*NL*
answered
;
``
but
a
moment
when
every
duty
should
be
equally
considered
.
To
*NL*
us
you
can
be
of
no
further
service
here
,
but
your
precious
life
may
be
*NL*
saved
for
other
and
nearer
friends
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
made
no
reply
,
though
his
eye
fell
wistfully
on
the
beautiful
form
of
*NL*
Alice
,
who
was
clinging
to
his
arm
with
the
dependency
of
an
infant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Consider
,
''
continued
Cora
,
after
a
pause
,
during
which
she
seemed
*NL*
to
struggle
with
a
pang
even
more
acute
than
any
that
her
fears
had
*NL*
excited
,
``
that
the
worst
to
us
can
be
but
death
;
a
tribute
that
all
must
*NL*
pay
at
the
good
time
of
God
's
appointment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
evils
worse
than
death
,
''
said
Duncan
,
speaking
hoarsely
,
and
*NL*
as
if
fretful
at
her
importunity
,
``
but
which
the
presence
of
one
who
*NL*
would
die
in
your
behalf
may
avert
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Cora
ceased
her
entreaties
;
and
veiling
her
face
in
her
shawl
,
drew
the
*NL*
nearly
insensible
Alice
after
her
into
the
deepest
recess
of
the
inner
*NL*
cavern
.

Death
of
Agrippina
*NL*
*NL*
The
sudden
and
almost
magical
change
,
from
the
stirring
incidents
of
the
*NL*
combat
to
the
stillness
that
now
reigned
around
him
,
acted
on
the
heated
*NL*
imagination
of
Heyward
like
some
exciting
dream
.
While
all
the
images
*NL*
and
events
he
had
witnessed
remained
deeply
impressed
on
his
memory
,
he
*NL*
felt
a
difficulty
in
persuading
him
of
their
truth
.
Still
ignorant
of
*NL*
the
fate
of
those
who
had
trusted
to
the
aid
of
the
swift
current
,
he
*NL*
at
first
listened
intently
to
any
signal
or
sounds
of
alarm
,
which
might
*NL*
announce
the
good
or
evil
fortune
of
their
hazardous
undertaking
.
His
*NL*
attention
was
,
however
,
bestowed
in
vain
;
for
with
the
disappearance
of
*NL*
Uncas
,
every
sign
of
the
adventurers
had
been
lost
,
leaving
him
in
total
*NL*
uncertainty
of
their
fate
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
moment
of
such
painful
doubt
,
Duncan
did
not
hesitate
to
look
*NL*
around
him
,
without
consulting
that
protection
from
the
rocks
which
just
*NL*
before
had
been
so
necessary
to
his
safety
.
Every
effort
,
however
,
to
*NL*
detect
the
least
evidence
of
the
approach
of
their
hidden
enemies
was
as
*NL*
fruitless
as
the
inquiry
after
his
late
companions
.
The
wooded
banks
of
*NL*
the
river
seemed
again
deserted
by
everything
possessing
animal
life
.
*NL*
The
uproar
which
had
so
lately
echoed
through
the
vaults
of
the
forest
*NL*
was
gone
,
leaving
the
rush
of
the
waters
to
swell
and
sink
on
the
*NL*
currents
of
the
air
,
in
the
unmingled
sweetness
of
nature
.
A
fish-hawk
,
*NL*
which
,
secure
on
the
topmost
branches
of
a
dead
pine
,
had
been
a
distant
*NL*
spectator
of
the
fray
,
now
swooped
from
his
high
and
ragged
perch
,
and
*NL*
soared
,
in
wide
sweeps
,
above
his
prey
;
while
a
jay
,
whose
noisy
voice
*NL*
had
been
stilled
by
the
hoarser
cries
of
the
savages
,
ventured
again
*NL*
to
open
his
discordant
throat
,
as
though
once
more
in
undisturbed
*NL*
possession
of
his
wild
domains
.
Duncan
caught
from
these
natural
*NL*
accompaniments
of
the
solitary
scene
a
glimmering
of
hope
;
and
he
began
*NL*
to
rally
his
faculties
to
renewed
exertions
,
with
something
like
a
*NL*
reviving
confidence
of
success
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Hurons
are
not
to
be
seen
,
''
he
said
,
addressing
David
,
who
had
*NL*
by
no
means
recovered
from
the
effects
of
the
stunning
blow
he
had
*NL*
received
;
``
let
us
conceal
ourselves
in
the
cavern
,
and
trust
the
rest
to
*NL*
Providence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
remember
to
have
united
with
two
comely
maidens
,
in
lifting
up
*NL*
our
voices
in
praise
and
thanksgiving
,
''
returned
the
bewildered
*NL*
singing-master
;
``
since
which
time
I
have
been
visited
by
a
heavy
*NL*
judgment
for
my
sins
.
I
have
been
mocked
with
the
likeness
of
sleep
,
*NL*
while
sounds
of
discord
have
rent
my
ears
,
such
as
might
manifest
the
*NL*
fullness
of
time
,
and
that
nature
had
forgotten
her
harmony
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
fellow
!
thine
own
period
was
,
in
truth
,
near
its
accomplishment
!
*NL*
But
arouse
,
and
come
with
me
;
I
will
lead
you
where
all
other
sounds
but
*NL*
those
of
your
own
psalmody
shall
be
excluded
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
melody
in
the
fall
of
the
cataract
,
and
the
rushing
of
many
*NL*
waters
is
sweet
to
the
senses
!
''
said
David
,
pressing
his
hand
confusedly
*NL*
on
his
brow
.
``
Is
not
the
air
yet
filled
with
shrieks
and
cries
,
as
*NL*
though
the
departed
spirits
of
the
damned
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
now
,
not
now
,
''
interrupted
the
impatient
Heyward
,
``
they
have
*NL*
ceased
,
and
they
who
raised
them
,
I
trust
in
God
,
they
are
gone
,
too
!
*NL*
everything
but
the
water
is
still
and
at
peace
;
in
,
then
,
where
you
may
*NL*
create
those
sounds
you
love
so
well
to
hear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
David
smiled
sadly
,
though
not
without
a
momentary
gleam
of
pleasure
,
at
*NL*
this
allusion
to
his
beloved
vocation
.
He
no
longer
hesitated
to
be
led
*NL*
to
a
spot
which
promised
such
unalloyed
gratification
to
his
wearied
*NL*
senses
;
and
leaning
on
the
arm
of
his
companion
,
he
entered
the
narrow
*NL*
mouth
of
the
cave
.
Duncan
seized
a
pile
of
the
sassafras
,
which
he
*NL*
drew
before
the
passage
,
studiously
concealing
every
appearance
of
an
*NL*
aperture
.
Within
this
fragile
barrier
he
arranged
the
blankets
abandoned
*NL*
by
the
foresters
,
darkening
the
inner
extremity
of
the
cavern
,
while
its
*NL*
outer
received
a
chastened
light
from
the
narrow
ravine
,
through
which
*NL*
one
arm
of
the
river
rushed
to
form
the
junction
with
its
sister
branch
*NL*
a
few
rods
below
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
like
not
the
principle
of
the
natives
,
which
teaches
them
to
submit
*NL*
without
a
struggle
,
in
emergencies
that
appear
desperate
,
''
he
said
,
*NL*
while
busied
in
this
employment
;
``
our
own
maxim
,
which
says
,
`
while
*NL*
life
remains
there
is
hope
'
,
is
more
consoling
,
and
better
suited
to
*NL*
a
soldier
's
temperament
.
To
you
,
Cora
,
I
will
urge
no
words
of
idle
*NL*
encouragement
;
your
own
fortitude
and
undisturbed
reason
will
teach
*NL*
you
all
that
may
become
your
sex
;
but
can
not
we
dry
the
tears
of
that
*NL*
trembling
weeper
on
your
bosom
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
calmer
,
Duncan
,
''
said
Alice
,
raising
herself
from
the
arms
of
her
*NL*
sister
,
and
forcing
an
appearance
of
composure
through
her
tears
;
``
much
*NL*
calmer
,
now
.
Surely
,
in
this
hidden
spot
we
are
safe
,
we
are
secret
,
*NL*
free
from
injury
;
we
will
hope
everything
from
those
generous
men
who
*NL*
have
risked
so
much
already
in
our
behalf
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
does
our
gentle
Alice
speak
like
a
daughter
of
Munro
!
''
said
*NL*
Heyward
,
pausing
to
press
her
hand
as
he
passed
toward
the
outer
*NL*
entrance
of
the
cavern
.
``
With
two
such
examples
of
courage
before
him
,
a
*NL*
man
would
be
ashamed
to
prove
other
than
a
hero
.
''
He
then
seated
himself
*NL*
in
the
center
of
the
cavern
,
grasping
his
remaining
pistol
with
a
hand
*NL*
convulsively
clenched
,
while
his
contracted
and
frowning
eye
announced
*NL*
the
sullen
desperation
of
his
purpose
.
``
The
Hurons
,
if
they
come
,
may
*NL*
not
gain
our
position
so
easily
as
they
think
,
''
he
slowly
muttered
;
and
*NL*
propping
his
head
back
against
the
rock
,
he
seemed
to
await
the
result
*NL*
in
patience
,
though
his
gaze
was
unceasingly
bent
on
the
open
avenue
to
*NL*
their
place
of
retreat
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
the
last
sound
of
his
voice
,
a
deep
,
a
long
,
and
almost
breathless
*NL*
silence
succeeded
.
The
fresh
air
of
the
morning
had
penetrated
the
*NL*
recess
,
and
its
influence
was
gradually
felt
on
the
spirits
of
its
*NL*
inmates
.
As
minute
after
minute
passed
by
,
leaving
them
in
undisturbed
*NL*
security
,
the
insinuating
feeling
of
hope
was
gradually
gaining
*NL*
possession
of
every
bosom
,
though
each
one
felt
reluctant
to
give
*NL*
utterance
to
expectations
that
the
next
moment
might
so
fearfully
*NL*
destroy
.
*NL*
*NL*
David
alone
formed
an
exception
to
these
varying
emotions
.
A
gleam
of
*NL*
light
from
the
opening
crossed
his
wan
countenance
,
and
fell
upon
*NL*
the
pages
of
the
little
volume
,
whose
leaves
he
was
again
occupied
in
*NL*
turning
,
as
if
searching
for
some
song
more
fitted
to
their
condition
*NL*
than
any
that
had
yet
met
their
eye
.
He
was
,
most
probably
,
acting
all
*NL*
this
time
under
a
confused
recollection
of
the
promised
consolation
of
*NL*
Duncan
.
At
length
,
it
would
seem
,
his
patient
industry
found
its
reward
;
*NL*
for
,
without
explanation
or
apology
,
he
pronounced
aloud
the
words
``
Isle
*NL*
of
Wight
,
''
drew
a
long
,
sweet
sound
from
his
pitch-pipe
,
and
then
ran
*NL*
through
the
preliminary
modulations
of
the
air
whose
name
he
had
just
*NL*
mentioned
,
with
the
sweeter
tones
of
his
own
musical
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
not
this
prove
dangerous
?
''
asked
Cora
,
glancing
her
dark
eye
at
*NL*
Major
Heyward
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
fellow
!
his
voice
is
too
feeble
to
be
heard
above
the
din
of
the
*NL*
falls
,
''
was
the
answer
;
``
beside
,
the
cavern
will
prove
his
friend
.
Let
*NL*
him
indulge
his
passions
since
it
may
be
done
without
hazard
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Isle
of
Wight
!
''
repeated
David
,
looking
about
him
with
that
dignity
*NL*
with
which
he
had
long
been
wont
to
silence
the
whispering
echoes
of
his
*NL*
school
;
''
't
is
a
brave
tune
,
and
set
to
solemn
words
!
let
it
be
sung
with
*NL*
meet
respect
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
allowing
a
moment
of
stillness
to
enforce
his
discipline
,
the
*NL*
voice
of
the
singer
was
heard
,
in
low
,
murmuring
syllables
,
gradually
*NL*
stealing
on
the
ear
,
until
it
filled
the
narrow
vault
with
sounds
*NL*
rendered
trebly
thrilling
by
the
feeble
and
tremulous
utterance
produced
*NL*
by
his
debility
.
The
melody
,
which
no
weakness
could
destroy
,
gradually
*NL*
wrought
its
sweet
influence
on
the
senses
of
those
who
heard
it
.
It
even
*NL*
prevailed
over
the
miserable
travesty
of
the
song
of
David
which
the
*NL*
singer
had
selected
from
a
volume
of
similar
effusions
,
and
caused
the
*NL*
sense
to
be
forgotten
in
the
insinuating
harmony
of
the
sounds
.
Alice
*NL*
unconsciously
dried
her
tears
,
and
bent
her
melting
eyes
on
the
pallid
*NL*
features
of
Gamut
,
with
an
expression
of
chastened
delight
that
she
*NL*
neither
affected
or
wished
to
conceal
.
Cora
bestowed
an
approving
smile
*NL*
on
the
pious
efforts
of
the
namesake
of
the
Jewish
prince
,
and
Heyward
*NL*
soon
turned
his
steady
,
stern
look
from
the
outlet
of
the
cavern
,
to
*NL*
fasten
it
,
with
a
milder
character
,
on
the
face
of
David
,
or
to
meet
the
*NL*
wandering
beams
which
at
moments
strayed
from
the
humid
eyes
of
Alice
.
*NL*
The
open
sympathy
of
the
listeners
stirred
the
spirit
of
the
votary
of
*NL*
music
,
whose
voice
regained
its
richness
and
volume
,
without
losing
that
*NL*
touching
softness
which
proved
its
secret
charm
.
Exerting
his
renovated
*NL*
powers
to
their
utmost
,
he
was
yet
filling
the
arches
of
the
cave
*NL*
with
long
and
full
tones
,
when
a
yell
burst
into
the
air
without
,
that
*NL*
instantly
stilled
his
pious
strains
,
choking
his
voice
suddenly
,
as
*NL*
though
his
heart
had
literally
bounded
into
the
passage
of
his
throat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
lost
!
''
exclaimed
Alice
,
throwing
herself
into
the
arms
of
Cora
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
yet
,
not
yet
,
''
returned
the
agitated
but
undaunted
Heyward
:
``
the
*NL*
sound
came
from
the
center
of
the
island
,
and
it
has
been
produced
by
*NL*
the
sight
of
their
dead
companions
.
We
are
not
yet
discovered
,
and
there
*NL*
is
still
hope
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Faint
and
almost
despairing
as
was
the
prospect
of
escape
,
the
words
of
*NL*
Duncan
were
not
thrown
away
,
for
it
awakened
the
powers
of
the
sisters
*NL*
in
such
a
manner
that
they
awaited
the
results
in
silence
.
A
second
yell
*NL*
soon
followed
the
first
,
when
a
rush
of
voices
was
heard
pouring
down
*NL*
the
island
,
from
its
upper
to
its
lower
extremity
,
until
they
reached
*NL*
the
naked
rock
above
the
caverns
,
where
,
after
a
shout
of
savage
*NL*
triumph
,
the
air
continued
full
of
horrible
cries
and
screams
,
such
*NL*
as
man
alone
can
utter
,
and
he
only
when
in
a
state
of
the
fiercest
*NL*
barbarity
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sounds
quickly
spread
around
them
in
every
direction
.
Some
called
to
*NL*
their
fellows
from
the
water
's
edge
,
and
were
answered
from
the
heights
*NL*
above
.
Cries
were
heard
in
the
startling
vicinity
of
the
chasm
between
*NL*
the
two
caves
,
which
mingled
with
hoarser
yells
that
arose
out
of
the
*NL*
abyss
of
the
deep
ravine
.
In
short
,
so
rapidly
had
the
savage
sounds
*NL*
diffused
themselves
over
the
barren
rock
,
that
it
was
not
difficult
*NL*
for
the
anxious
listeners
to
imagine
they
could
be
heard
beneath
,
as
in
*NL*
truth
they
were
above
on
every
side
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
midst
of
this
tumult
,
a
triumphant
yell
was
raised
within
a
few
*NL*
yards
of
the
hidden
entrance
to
the
cave
.
Heyward
abandoned
every
hope
,
*NL*
with
the
belief
it
was
the
signal
that
they
were
discovered
.
Again
the
*NL*
impression
passed
away
,
as
he
heard
the
voices
collect
near
the
spot
*NL*
where
the
white
man
had
so
reluctantly
abandoned
his
rifle
.
Amid
the
*NL*
jargon
of
Indian
dialects
that
he
now
plainly
heard
,
it
was
easy
to
*NL*
distinguish
not
only
words
,
but
sentences
,
in
the
patois
of
the
Canadas
.
*NL*
A
burst
of
voices
had
shouted
simultaneously
,
``
La
Longue
Carabine
!
''
*NL*
causing
the
opposite
woods
to
re-echo
with
a
name
which
,
Heyward
well
*NL*
remembered
,
had
been
given
by
his
enemies
to
a
celebrated
hunter
and
*NL*
scout
of
the
English
camp
,
and
who
,
he
now
learned
for
the
first
time
,
*NL*
had
been
his
late
companion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
La
Longue
Carabine
!
La
Longue
Carabine
!
''
passed
from
mouth
to
mouth
,
*NL*
until
the
whole
band
appeared
to
be
collected
around
a
trophy
which
*NL*
would
seem
to
announce
the
death
of
its
formidable
owner
.
After
a
*NL*
vociferous
consultation
,
which
was
,
at
times
,
deafened
by
bursts
of
*NL*
savage
joy
,
they
again
separated
,
filling
the
air
with
the
name
of
a
*NL*
foe
,
whose
body
,
Heywood
could
collect
from
their
expressions
,
they
*NL*
hoped
to
find
concealed
in
some
crevice
of
the
island
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
''
he
whispered
to
the
trembling
sisters
,
``
now
is
the
moment
of
*NL*
uncertainty
!
if
our
place
of
retreat
escape
this
scrutiny
,
we
are
*NL*
still
safe
!
In
every
event
,
we
are
assured
,
by
what
has
fallen
from
our
*NL*
enemies
,
that
our
friends
have
escaped
,
and
in
two
short
hours
we
may
*NL*
look
for
succor
from
Webb
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
now
a
few
minutes
of
fearful
stillness
,
during
which
Heyward
*NL*
well
knew
that
the
savages
conducted
their
search
with
greater
vigilance
*NL*
and
method
.
More
than
once
he
could
distinguish
their
footsteps
,
as
*NL*
they
brushed
the
sassafras
,
causing
the
faded
leaves
to
rustle
,
and
the
*NL*
branches
to
snap
.
At
length
,
the
pile
yielded
a
little
,
a
corner
of
a
*NL*
blanket
fell
,
and
a
faint
ray
of
light
gleamed
into
the
inner
part
of
*NL*
the
cave
.
Cora
folded
Alice
to
her
bosom
in
agony
,
and
Duncan
sprang
*NL*
to
his
feet
.
A
shout
was
at
that
moment
heard
,
as
if
issuing
from
the
*NL*
center
of
the
rock
,
announcing
that
the
neighboring
cavern
had
at
*NL*
length
been
entered
.
In
a
minute
,
the
number
and
loudness
of
the
voices
*NL*
indicated
that
the
whole
party
was
collected
in
and
around
that
secret
*NL*
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
inner
passages
to
the
two
caves
were
so
close
to
each
other
,
*NL*
Duncan
,
believing
that
escape
was
no
longer
possible
,
passed
David
and
*NL*
the
sisters
,
to
place
himself
between
the
latter
and
the
first
onset
of
*NL*
the
terrible
meeting
.
Grown
desperate
by
his
situation
,
he
drew
nigh
*NL*
the
slight
barrier
which
separated
him
only
by
a
few
feet
from
his
*NL*
relentless
pursuers
,
and
placing
his
face
to
the
casual
opening
,
he
even
*NL*
looked
out
with
a
sort
of
desperate
indifference
,
on
their
movements
.
*NL*
*NL*
Within
reach
of
his
arm
was
the
brawny
shoulder
of
a
gigantic
Indian
,
*NL*
whose
deep
and
authoritative
voice
appeared
to
give
directions
to
the
*NL*
proceedings
of
his
fellows
.
Beyond
him
again
,
Duncan
could
look
into
the
*NL*
vault
opposite
,
which
was
filled
with
savages
,
upturning
and
rifling
the
*NL*
humble
furniture
of
the
scout
.
The
wound
of
David
had
dyed
the
leaves
*NL*
of
sassafras
with
a
color
that
the
native
well
knew
as
anticipating
the
*NL*
season
.
Over
this
sign
of
their
success
,
they
sent
up
a
howl
,
like
an
*NL*
opening
from
so
many
hounds
who
had
recovered
a
lost
trail
.
After
this
*NL*
yell
of
victory
,
they
tore
up
the
fragrant
bed
of
the
cavern
,
and
bore
*NL*
the
branches
into
the
chasm
,
scattering
the
boughs
,
as
if
they
suspected
*NL*
them
of
concealing
the
person
of
the
man
they
had
so
long
hated
and
*NL*
feared
.
One
fierce
and
wild-looking
warrior
approached
the
chief
,
*NL*
bearing
a
load
of
the
brush
,
and
pointing
exultingly
to
the
deep
red
*NL*
stains
with
which
it
was
sprinkled
,
uttered
his
joy
in
Indian
yells
,
*NL*
whose
meaning
Heyward
was
only
enabled
to
comprehend
by
the
frequent
*NL*
repetition
of
the
name
``
La
Longue
Carabine
!
''
When
his
triumph
had
*NL*
ceased
,
he
cast
the
brush
on
the
slight
heap
Duncan
had
made
before
*NL*
the
entrance
of
the
second
cavern
,
and
closed
the
view
.
His
example
was
*NL*
followed
by
others
,
who
,
as
they
drew
the
branches
from
the
cave
of
the
*NL*
scout
,
threw
them
into
one
pile
,
adding
,
unconsciously
,
to
the
security
*NL*
of
those
they
sought
.
The
very
slightness
of
the
defense
was
its
chief
*NL*
merit
,
for
no
one
thought
of
disturbing
a
mass
of
brush
,
which
all
*NL*
of
them
believed
,
in
that
moment
of
hurry
and
confusion
,
had
been
*NL*
accidentally
raised
by
the
hands
of
their
own
party
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
blankets
yielded
before
the
outward
pressure
,
and
the
branches
*NL*
settled
in
the
fissure
of
the
rock
by
their
own
weight
,
forming
a
*NL*
compact
body
,
Duncan
once
more
breathed
freely
.
With
a
light
step
and
*NL*
lighter
heart
,
he
returned
to
the
center
of
the
cave
,
and
took
the
*NL*
place
he
had
left
,
where
he
could
command
a
view
of
the
opening
next
the
*NL*
river
.
While
he
was
in
the
act
of
making
this
movement
,
the
Indians
,
as
*NL*
if
changing
their
purpose
by
a
common
impulse
,
broke
away
from
the
chasm
*NL*
in
a
body
,
and
were
heard
rushing
up
the
island
again
,
toward
the
point
*NL*
whence
they
had
originally
descended
.
Here
another
wailing
cry
betrayed
*NL*
that
they
were
again
collected
around
the
bodies
of
their
dead
comrades
.
*NL*
*NL*
Duncan
now
ventured
to
look
at
his
companions
;
for
,
during
the
most
*NL*
critical
moments
of
their
danger
,
he
had
been
apprehensive
that
the
*NL*
anxiety
of
his
countenance
might
communicate
some
additional
alarm
to
*NL*
those
who
were
so
little
able
to
sustain
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
gone
,
Cora
!
''
he
whispered
;
``
Alice
,
they
are
returned
whence
*NL*
they
came
,
and
we
are
saved
!
To
Heaven
,
that
has
alone
delivered
us
from
*NL*
the
grasp
of
so
merciless
an
enemy
,
be
all
the
praise
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
to
Heaven
will
I
return
my
thanks
!
''
exclaimed
the
younger
sister
,
*NL*
rising
from
the
encircling
arm
of
Cora
,
and
casting
herself
with
*NL*
enthusiastic
gratitude
on
the
naked
rock
;
``
to
that
Heaven
who
has
spared
*NL*
the
tears
of
a
gray-headed
father
;
has
saved
the
lives
of
those
I
so
*NL*
much
love
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Both
Heyward
and
the
more
temperate
Cora
witnessed
the
act
of
*NL*
involuntary
emotion
with
powerful
sympathy
,
the
former
secretly
*NL*
believing
that
piety
had
never
worn
a
form
so
lovely
as
it
had
now
*NL*
assumed
in
the
youthful
person
of
Alice
.
Her
eyes
were
radiant
with
the
*NL*
glow
of
grateful
feelings
;
the
flush
of
her
beauty
was
again
seated
on
*NL*
her
cheeks
,
and
her
whole
soul
seemed
ready
and
anxious
to
pour
out
its
*NL*
thanksgivings
through
the
medium
of
her
eloquent
features
.
But
when
her
*NL*
lips
moved
,
the
words
they
should
have
uttered
appeared
frozen
by
some
*NL*
new
and
sudden
chill
.
Her
bloom
gave
place
to
the
paleness
of
death
;
*NL*
her
soft
and
melting
eyes
grew
hard
,
and
seemed
contracting
with
horror
;
*NL*
while
those
hands
,
which
she
had
raised
,
clasped
in
each
other
,
toward
*NL*
heaven
,
dropped
in
horizontal
lines
before
her
,
the
fingers
pointed
*NL*
forward
in
convulsed
motion
.
Heyward
turned
the
instant
she
gave
a
*NL*
direction
to
his
suspicions
,
and
peering
just
above
the
ledge
which
*NL*
formed
the
threshold
of
the
open
outlet
of
the
cavern
,
he
beheld
the
*NL*
malignant
,
fierce
and
savage
features
of
Le
Renard
Subtil
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
that
moment
of
surprise
,
the
self-possession
of
Heyward
did
not
*NL*
desert
him
.
He
observed
by
the
vacant
expression
of
the
Indian
's
*NL*
countenance
,
that
his
eye
,
accustomed
to
the
open
air
had
not
yet
*NL*
been
able
to
penetrate
the
dusky
light
which
pervaded
the
depth
of
the
*NL*
cavern
.
He
had
even
thought
of
retreating
beyond
a
curvature
in
the
*NL*
natural
wall
,
which
might
still
conceal
him
and
his
companions
,
when
by
*NL*
the
sudden
gleam
of
intelligence
that
shot
across
the
features
of
the
*NL*
savage
,
he
saw
it
was
too
late
,
and
that
they
were
betrayed
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
look
of
exultation
and
brutal
triumph
which
announced
this
terrible
*NL*
truth
was
irresistibly
irritating
.
Forgetful
of
everything
but
the
*NL*
impulses
of
his
hot
blood
,
Duncan
leveled
his
pistol
and
fired
.
The
*NL*
report
of
the
weapon
made
the
cavern
bellow
like
an
eruption
from
a
*NL*
volcano
;
and
when
the
smoke
it
vomited
had
been
driven
away
before
the
*NL*
current
of
air
which
issued
from
the
ravine
the
place
so
lately
occupied
*NL*
by
the
features
of
his
treacherous
guide
was
vacant
.
Rushing
to
the
*NL*
outlet
,
Heyward
caught
a
glimpse
of
his
dark
figure
stealing
around
a
*NL*
low
and
narrow
ledge
,
which
soon
hid
him
entirely
from
sight
.
*NL*
*NL*
Among
the
savages
a
frightful
stillness
succeeded
the
explosion
,
which
*NL*
had
just
been
heard
bursting
from
the
bowels
of
the
rock
.
But
when
*NL*
Le
Renard
raised
his
voice
in
a
long
and
intelligible
whoop
,
it
was
*NL*
answered
by
a
spontaneous
yell
from
the
mouth
of
every
Indian
within
*NL*
hearing
of
the
sound
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
clamorous
noises
again
rushed
down
the
island
;
and
before
Duncan
*NL*
had
time
to
recover
from
the
shock
,
his
feeble
barrier
of
brush
was
*NL*
scattered
to
the
winds
,
the
cavern
was
entered
at
both
its
extremities
,
*NL*
and
he
and
his
companions
were
dragged
from
their
shelter
and
borne
into
*NL*
the
day
,
where
they
stood
surrounded
by
the
whole
band
of
the
triumphant
*NL*
Hurons
.

CHAPTER
10
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
fear
we
shall
outsleep
the
coming
morn
*NL*
As
much
as
we
this
night
have
overwatched
!
''
*NL*
--
Midsummer
Night
's
Dream
*NL*
*NL*
The
instant
the
shock
of
this
sudden
misfortune
had
abated
,
Duncan
began
*NL*
to
make
his
observations
on
the
appearance
and
proceedings
of
their
*NL*
captors
.
Contrary
to
the
usages
of
the
natives
in
the
wantonness
of
*NL*
their
success
they
had
respected
,
not
only
the
persons
of
the
trembling
*NL*
sisters
,
but
his
own
.
The
rich
ornaments
of
his
military
attire
had
*NL*
indeed
been
repeatedly
handled
by
different
individuals
of
the
tribes
*NL*
with
eyes
expressing
a
savage
longing
to
possess
the
baubles
;
but
*NL*
before
the
customary
violence
could
be
resorted
to
,
a
mandate
in
the
*NL*
authoritative
voice
of
the
large
warrior
,
already
mentioned
,
stayed
the
*NL*
uplifted
hand
,
and
convinced
Heyward
that
they
were
to
be
reserved
for
*NL*
some
object
of
particular
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
,
however
,
these
manifestations
of
weakness
were
exhibited
by
the
*NL*
young
and
vain
of
the
party
,
the
more
experienced
warriors
continued
*NL*
their
search
throughout
both
caverns
,
with
an
activity
that
denoted
they
*NL*
were
far
from
being
satisfied
with
those
fruits
of
their
conquest
which
*NL*
had
already
been
brought
to
light
.
Unable
to
discover
any
new
victim
,
*NL*
these
diligent
workers
of
vengeance
soon
approached
their
male
*NL*
prisoners
,
pronouncing
the
name
``
La
Longue
Carabine
,
''
with
a
fierceness
*NL*
that
could
not
be
easily
mistaken
.
Duncan
affected
not
to
comprehend
*NL*
the
meaning
of
their
repeated
and
violent
interrogatories
,
while
his
*NL*
companion
was
spared
the
effort
of
a
similar
deception
by
his
ignorance
*NL*
of
French
.
Wearied
at
length
by
their
importunities
,
and
apprehensive
*NL*
of
irritating
his
captors
by
too
stubborn
a
silence
,
the
former
*NL*
looked
about
him
in
quest
of
Magua
,
who
might
interpret
his
answers
*NL*
to
questions
which
were
at
each
moment
becoming
more
earnest
and
*NL*
threatening
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
conduct
of
this
savage
had
formed
a
solitary
exception
to
that
of
*NL*
all
his
fellows
.
While
the
others
were
busily
occupied
in
seeking
*NL*
to
gratify
their
childish
passion
for
finery
,
by
plundering
even
*NL*
the
miserable
effects
of
the
scout
,
or
had
been
searching
with
such
*NL*
bloodthirsty
vengeance
in
their
looks
for
their
absent
owner
,
Le
Renard
*NL*
had
stood
at
a
little
distance
from
the
prisoners
,
with
a
demeanor
so
*NL*
quiet
and
satisfied
,
as
to
betray
that
he
had
already
effected
the
grand
*NL*
purpose
of
his
treachery
.
When
the
eyes
of
Heyward
first
met
those
of
*NL*
his
recent
guide
,
he
turned
them
away
in
horror
at
the
sinister
though
*NL*
calm
look
he
encountered
.
Conquering
his
disgust
,
however
,
he
was
able
,
*NL*
with
an
averted
face
,
to
address
his
successful
enemy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Le
Renard
Subtil
is
too
much
of
a
warrior
,
''
said
the
reluctant

Magua
,
in
his
broken
English
,
laying
his
hand
,
at
the

with
a
ferocious
smile
,
on
the

leaves
with
which
a
wound
*NL*
on

shoulder
was
bandaged

''
`
La

Carabine

!
His
rifle
*NL*
is
good
,
and
his
eye
never
shut
;
but
,
like
the
short
gun
of
the
white
*NL*
chief
,
it
is
nothing
against
the
life
of
Le
Subtil

*NL*
``

brave

*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
it
war

the
tired
Indian
rested

who
drew

was
colored

Magua
say
that

out
of

ground
,
and
that
his
hand
had
*NL*
dug

''
*NL*
*NL*
As
Duncan
dared
not
retort
upon
his
accuser
by
reminding
him
of
his
own
*NL*
premeditated
treachery
,
and
disdained
to
deprecate
his
resentment
by
any
*NL*
words
of
apology
,
he
remained
silent
.
Magua
seemed
also
content
to
*NL*
rest
the
controversy
as
well
as
all
further
communication
there
,
for
he
*NL*
resumed
the
leaning
attitude
against
the
rock
from
which
,
in
momentary
*NL*
energy
,
he
had
arisen
.
But
the
cry
of
``
La
Longue
Carabine
''
was
renewed
*NL*
the
instant
the
impatient
savages
perceived
that
the
short
dialogue
was
*NL*
ended
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
hear
,
''
said
Magua
,
with
stubborn
indifference
:
``
the
red
Hurons
call
*NL*
for

or
they
will
have

of
him

him
hid

*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is

he
is
far
beyond

''
*NL*
*NL*
Renard
smiled
with
cold
contempt
,
as
he
answered
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
When

he
thinks

*NL*
*NL*
``
He

*NL*
*NL*
Magua
shook
his
head
incredulously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
he
a
bird

*NL*
*NL*
``
Though
no

He
floated
down
the
stream
*NL*
when
the
powder
was
all
burned
,
and
when
the
eyes
of
the
Hurons
were
*NL*
behind
a
cloud
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
why
did
the
white
chief
stay
?

demanded
the
still
incredulous
*NL*
Indian
.
``
Is
he
a
stone
that
goes
to

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
the
provoked
young
man
,
using
,
*NL*
in
his
anger
,
that
boastful
language
which
was
most
likely
to
excite
the
*NL*
admiration
of
an
Indian
.
``
The
white
man
thinks
none
but
cowards

*NL*
their
women

''
*NL*
*NL*
Magua
muttered
a
few
words
,
inaudibly
,
between
his
teeth
,
before
he
*NL*
continued
,
aloud
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
the
Delawares

too
,
as
well
as
crawl

Where
is

Gros
Serpent
'
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Duncan
,
who
perceived
by
the
use
of
these
Canadian
appellations
,
that
*NL*
his
late
companions
were
much
better
known
to
his
enemies
than
to
*NL*
himself
,
answered
,
reluctantly
:
``
He
also
is
gone
down
with
the
water

''
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Le
Cerf
Agile

is
not
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
not
whom
you
call
`

,
''
said
Duncan
gladly
*NL*
profiting
by
any
excuse
to
create
delay
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Uncas
,
''
returned
Magua
,
pronouncing
the
Delaware
name
with
even
greater
*NL*
difficulty
than
he
spoke
his
English
words
.
''

Bounding
Elk

when

calls

*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
is
some
confusion
in
names
between
us
,
Le
Renard
,
''
said
Duncan
,
*NL*
hoping
to
provoke
a
discussion
.
``
Daim
is
the
French
for
deer
,
and
cerf
*NL*

the
true
term
,
when
one
would
speak
of
an
elk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
muttered
the
Indian
,
in
his
native
tongue
;
``
the
pale
faces
are
*NL*
prattling
women
!
they
have
two
words
for
each
thing
,
while
a
red-skin
*NL*
will
make
the
sound
of
his
voice
speak
to
him
.
''
Then
,
changing
his
*NL*
language
,
he
continued
,
adhering
to
the
imperfect
nomenclature
of
his
*NL*
provincial
instructors
.
``
The
deer
is
swift
,
but
weak
;
the
elk
is
swift
,
*NL*
but
strong
;
and
the
son
of
`
Le
Serpent
'
is
`
Le
Cerf
Agile
.
'
Has
he
*NL*
leaped
the
river
to
the
woods
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
mean
the
younger
Delaware
,
he
,
too
,
has
gone
down
with
the
*NL*
water
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
there
was
nothing
improbable
to
an
Indian
in
the
manner
of
the
*NL*
escape
,
Magua
admitted
the
truth
of
what
he
had
heard
,
with
a
readiness
*NL*
that
afforded
additional
evidence
how
little
he
would
prize
such
*NL*
worthless
captives
.
With
his
companions
,
however
,
the
feeling
was
*NL*
manifestly
different
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Hurons
had
awaited
the
result
of
this
short
dialogue
with
*NL*
characteristic
patience
,
and
with
a
silence
that
increased
until
there
*NL*
was
a
general
stillness
in
the
band
.
When
Heyward
ceased
to
speak
,
they
*NL*
turned
their
eyes
,
as
one
man
,
on
Magua
,
demanding
,
in
this
expressive
*NL*
manner
,
an
explanation
of
what
had
been
said
.
Their
interpreter
pointed
*NL*
to
the
river
,
and
made
them
acquainted
with
the
result
,
as
much
by
*NL*
the
action
as
by
the
few
words
he
uttered
.
When
the
fact
was
generally
*NL*
understood
,
the
savages
raised
a
frightful
yell
,
which
declared
the
*NL*
extent
of
their
disappointment
.
Some
ran
furiously
to
the
water
's
*NL*
edge
,
beating
the
air
with
frantic
gestures
,
while
others
spat
upon
the
*NL*
element
,
to
resent
the
supposed
treason
it
had
committed
against
*NL*
their
acknowledged
rights
as
conquerors
.
A
few
,
and
they
not
the
least
*NL*
powerful
and
terrific
of
the
band
,
threw
lowering
looks
,
in
which
the
*NL*
fiercest
passion
was
only
tempered
by
habitual
self-command
,
at
those
*NL*
captives
who
still
remained
in
their
power
,
while
one
or
two
even
gave
*NL*
vent
to
their
malignant
feelings
by
the
most
menacing
gestures
,
against
*NL*
which
neither
the
sex
nor
the
beauty
of
the
sisters
was
any
protection
.
*NL*
The
young
soldier
made
a
desperate
but
fruitless
effort
to
spring
to
the
*NL*
side
of
Alice
,
when
he
saw
the
dark
hand
of
a
savage
twisted
in
the
rich
*NL*
tresses
which
were
flowing
in
volumes
over
her
shoulders
,
while
a
knife
*NL*
was
passed
around
the
head
from
which
they
fell
,
as
if
to
denote
the
*NL*
horrid
manner
in
which
it
was
about
to
be
robbed
of
its
beautiful
*NL*
ornament
.
But
his
hands
were
bound
;
and
at
the
first
movement
he
made
,
*NL*
he
felt
the
grasp
of
the
powerful
Indian
who
directed
the
band
,
pressing
*NL*
his
shoulder
like
a
vise
.
Immediately
conscious
how
unavailing
any
*NL*
struggle
against
such
an
overwhelming
force
must
prove
,
he
submitted
*NL*
to
his
fate
,
encouraging
his
gentle
companions
by
a
few
low
and
tender
*NL*
assurances
,
that
the
natives
seldom
failed
to
threaten
more
than
they
*NL*
performed
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
while
Duncan
resorted
to
these
words
of
consolation
to
quiet
the
*NL*
apprehensions
of
the
sisters
,
he
was
not
so
weak
as
to
deceive
himself
.
*NL*
He
well
knew
that
the
authority
of
an
Indian
chief
was
so
little
*NL*
conventional
,
that
it
was
oftener
maintained
by
physical
superiority
*NL*
than
by
any
moral
supremacy
he
might
possess
.
The
danger
was
,
therefore
,
*NL*
magnified
exactly
in
proportion
to
the
number
of
the
savage
spirits
*NL*
by
which
they
were
surrounded
.
The
most
positive
mandate
from
him
who
*NL*
seemed
the
acknowledged
leader
,
was
liable
to
be
violated
at
each
moment
*NL*
by
any
rash
hand
that
might
choose
to
sacrifice
a
victim
to
the
manes
of
*NL*
some
dead
friend
or
relative
.
While
,
therefore
,
he
sustained
an
outward
*NL*
appearance
of
calmness
and
fortitude
,
his
heart
leaped
into
his
throat
,
*NL*
whenever
any
of
their
fierce
captors
drew
nearer
than
common
to
the
*NL*
helpless
sisters
,
or
fastened
one
of
their
sullen
,
wandering
looks
on
*NL*
those
fragile
forms
which
were
so
little
able
to
resist
the
slightest
*NL*
assault
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
apprehensions
were
,
however
,
greatly
relieved
,
when
he
saw
that
*NL*
the
leader
had
summoned
his
warriors
to
himself
in
counsel
.
Their
*NL*
deliberations
were
short
,
and
it
would
seem
,
by
the
silence
of
most
of
*NL*
the
party
,
the
decision
unanimous
.
By
the
frequency
with
which
the
few
*NL*
speakers
pointed
in
the
direction
of
the
encampment
of
Webb
,
it
was
*NL*
apparent
they
dreaded
the
approach
of
danger
from
that
quarter
.
This
*NL*
consideration
probably
hastened
their
determination
,
and
quickened
the
*NL*
subsequent
movements
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
his
short
conference
,
Heyward
,
finding
a
respite
from
his
gravest
*NL*
fears
,
had
leisure
to
admire
the
cautious
manner
in
which
the
Hurons
had
*NL*
made
their
approaches
,
even
after
hostilities
had
ceased
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
has
already
been
stated
that
the
upper
half
of
the
island
was
a
naked
*NL*
rock
,
and
destitute
of
any
other
defenses
than
a
few
scattered
logs
of
*NL*
driftwood
.
They
had
selected
this
point
to
make
their
descent
,
having
*NL*
borne
the
canoe
through
the
wood
around
the
cataract
for
that
purpose
.
*NL*
Placing
their
arms
in
the
little
vessel
a
dozen
men
clinging
to
its
*NL*
sides
had
trusted
themselves
to
the
direction
of
the
canoe
,
which
was
*NL*
controlled
by
two
of
the
most
skillful
warriors
,
in
attitudes
that
*NL*
enabled
them
to
command
a
view
of
the
dangerous
passage
.
Favored
by
this
*NL*
arrangement
,
they
touched
the
head
of
the
island
at
that
point
which
had
*NL*
proved
so
fatal
to
their
first
adventurers
,
but
with
the
advantages
of
*NL*
superior
numbers
,
and
the
possession
of
firearms
.
That
such
had
been
the
*NL*
manner
of
their
descent
was
rendered
quite
apparent
to
Duncan
;
for
they
*NL*
now
bore
the
light
bark
from
the
upper
end
of
the
rock
,
and
placed
it
*NL*
in
the
water
,
near
the
mouth
of
the
outer
cavern
.
As
soon
as
this
change
*NL*
was
made
,
the
leader
made
signs
to
the
prisoners
to
descend
and
enter
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
resistance
was
impossible
,
and
remonstrance
useless
,
Heyward
set
the
*NL*
example
of
submission
,
by
leading
the
way
into
the
canoe
,
where
he
*NL*
was
soon
seated
with
the
sisters
and
the
still
wondering
David
.
*NL*
Notwithstanding
the
Hurons
were
necessarily
ignorant
of
the
little
*NL*
channels
among
the
eddies
and
rapids
of
the
stream
,
they
knew
the
common
*NL*
signs
of
such
a
navigation
too
well
to
commit
any
material
blunder
.
*NL*
When
the
pilot
chosen
for
the
task
of
guiding
the
canoe
had
taken
his
*NL*
station
,
the
whole
band
plunged
again
into
the
river
,
the
vessel
glided
*NL*
down
the
current
,
and
in
a
few
moments
the
captives
found
themselves
on
*NL*
the
south
bank
of
the
stream
,
nearly
opposite
to
the
point
where
they
*NL*
had
struck
it
the
preceding
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
was
held
another
short
but
earnest
consultation
,
during
which
the
*NL*
horses
,
to
whose
panic
their
owners
ascribed
their
heaviest
misfortune
,
*NL*
were
led
from
the
cover
of
the
woods
,
and
brought
to
the
sheltered
spot
.
*NL*
The
band
now
divided
.
The
great
chief
,
so
often
mentioned
,
mounting
the
*NL*
charger
of
Heyward
,
led
the
way
directly
across
the
river
,
followed
by
*NL*
most
of
his
people
,
and
disappeared
in
the
woods
,
leaving
the
prisoners
*NL*
in
charge
of
six
savages
,
at
whose
head
was
Le
Renard
Subtil
.
Duncan
*NL*
witnessed
all
their
movements
with
renewed
uneasiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
been
fond
of
believing
,
from
the
uncommon
forbearance
of
the
*NL*
savages
,
that
he
was
reserved
as
a
prisoner
to
be
delivered
to
Montcalm
.
*NL*
As
the
thoughts
of
those
who
are
in
misery
seldom
slumber
,
and
the
*NL*
invention
is
never
more
lively
than
when
it
is
stimulated
by
hope
,
*NL*
however
feeble
and
remote
,
he
had
even
imagined
that
the
parental
*NL*
feelings
of
Munro
were
to
be
made
instrumental
in
seducing
him
from
his
*NL*
duty
to
the
king
.
For
though
the
French
commander
bore
a
high
character
*NL*
for
courage
and
enterprise
,
he
was
also
thought
to
be
expert
in
those
*NL*
political
practises
which
do
not
always
respect
the
nicer
obligations
*NL*
of
morality
,
and
which
so
generally
disgraced
the
European
diplomacy
of
*NL*
that
period
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
those
busy
and
ingenious
speculations
were
now
annihilated
by
the
*NL*
conduct
of
his
captors
.
That
portion
of
the
band
who
had
followed
the
*NL*
huge
warrior
took
the
route
toward
the
foot
of
the
Horican
,
and
no
other
*NL*
expectation
was
left
for
himself
and
companions
,
than
that
they
were
to
*NL*
be
retained
as
hopeless
captives
by
their
savage
conquerors
.
Anxious
to
*NL*
know
the
worst
,
and
willing
,
in
such
an
emergency
,
to
try
the
potency
of
*NL*
gold
he
overcame
his
reluctance
to
speak
to
Magua
.
Addressing
himself
*NL*
to
his
former
guide
,
who
had
now
assumed
the
authority
and
manner
of
one
*NL*
who
was
to
direct
the
future
movements
of
the
party
,
he
said
,
in
tones
*NL*
as
friendly
and
confiding
as
he
could
assume
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
speak
to
Magua
,
what
is
fit
only
for
so
great
a
chief
to
hear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Indian
turned
his
eyes
on
the
young
soldier
scornfully
,
as
he
*NL*
answered
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Speak
;
trees
have
no
ears
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
the
red
Hurons
are
not
deaf
;
and
counsel
that
is
fit
for
the
great
*NL*
men
of
a
nation
would
make
the
young
warriors
drunk
.
If
Magua
will
not
*NL*
listen
,
the
officer
of
the
king
knows
how
to
be
silent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
savage
spoke
carelessly
to
his
comrades
,
who
were
busied
,
after
*NL*
their
awkward
manner
,
in
preparing
the
horses
for
the
reception
of
the
*NL*
sisters
,
and
moved
a
little
to
one
side
,
whither
by
a
cautious
gesture
*NL*
he
induced
Heyward
to
follow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
speak
,
''
he
said
;
``
if
the
words
are
such
as
Magua
should
hear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Le
Renard
Subtil
has
proved
himself
worthy
of
the
honorable
name
given
*NL*
to
him
by
his
Canada
fathers
,
''
commenced
Heyward
;
``
I
see
his
wisdom
,
*NL*
and
all
that
he
has
done
for
us
,
and
shall
remember
it
when
the
hour
to
*NL*
reward
him
arrives
.
Yes
!
Renard
has
proved
that
he
is
not
only
a
great
*NL*
chief
in
council
,
but
one
who
knows
how
to
deceive
his
enemies
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
has
Renard
done
?
''
coldly
demanded
the
Indian
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
has
he
not
seen
that
the
woods
were
filled
with
outlying
parties
*NL*
of
the
enemies
,
and
that
the
serpent
could
not
steal
through
them
*NL*
without
being
seen
?
Then
,
did
he
not
lose
his
path
to
blind
the
eyes
of
*NL*
the
Hurons
?
Did
he
not
pretend
to
go
back
to
his
tribe
,
who
had
treated
*NL*
him
ill
,
and
driven
him
from
their
wigwams
like
a
dog
?
And
when
he
saw
*NL*
what
he
wished
to
do
,
did
we
not
aid
him
,
by
making
a
false
face
,
that
*NL*
the
Hurons
might
think
the
white
man
believed
that
his
friend
was
his
*NL*
enemy
?
Is
not
all
this
true
?
And
when
Le
Subtil
had
shut
the
eyes
and
*NL*
stopped
the
ears
of
his
nation
by
his
wisdom
,
did
they
not
forget
that
*NL*
they
had
once
done
him
wrong
,
and
forced
him
to
flee
to
the
Mohawks
?
*NL*
And
did
they
not
leave
him
on
the
south
side
of
the
river
,
with
their
*NL*
prisoners
,
while
they
have
gone
foolishly
on
the
north
?
Does
not
Renard
*NL*
mean
to
turn
like
a
fox
on
his
footsteps
,
and
to
carry
to
the
rich
and
*NL*
gray-headed
Scotchman
his
daughters
?
Yes
,
Magua
,
I
see
it
all
,
and
I
*NL*
have
already
been
thinking
how
so
much
wisdom
and
honesty
should
be
*NL*
repaid
.
First
,
the
chief
of
William
Henry
will
give
as
a
great
chief
*NL*
should
for
such
a
service
.
The
medal
*
of
Magua
will
no
longer
be
of
tin
,
*NL*
but
of
beaten
gold
;
his
horn
will
run
over
with
powder
;
dollars
will
be
*NL*
as
plenty
in
his
pouch
as
pebbles
on
the
shore
of
Horican
;
and
the
deer
*NL*
will
lick
his
hand
,
for
they
will
know
it
to
be
vain
to
fly
from
*NL*
the
rifle
he
will
carry
!
As
for
myself
,
I
know
not
how
to
exceed
the
*NL*
gratitude
of
the
Scotchman
,
but
I
--
yes
,
I
will
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
*
It
has
long
been
a
practice
with
the
whites
to
conciliate
*NL*
the
important
men
of
the
Indians
by
presenting
medals
,
which
*NL*
are
worn
in
the
place
of
their
own
rude
ornaments
.
Those
*NL*
given
by
the
English
generally
bear
the
impression
of
the
*NL*
reigning
king
,
and
those
given
by
the
Americans
that
of
the
*NL*
president
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
will
the
young
chief
,
who
comes
from
toward
the
sun
,
give
?
''
*NL*
demanded
the
Huron
,
observing
that
Heyward
hesitated
in
his
desire
to
*NL*
end
the
enumeration
of
benefits
with
that
which
might
form
the
climax
of
*NL*
an
Indian
's
wishes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
will
make
the
fire-water
from
the
islands
in
the
salt
lake
flow
*NL*
before
the
wigwam
of
Magua
,
until
the
heart
of
the
Indian
shall
be
*NL*
lighter
than
the
feathers
of
the
humming-bird
,
and
his
breath
sweeter
*NL*
than
the
wild
honeysuckle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Le
Renard
had
listened
gravely
as
Heyward
slowly
proceeded
in
this
*NL*
subtle
speech
.
When
the
young
man
mentioned
the
artifice
he
supposed
*NL*
the
Indian
to
have
practised
on
his
own
nation
,
the
countenance
of
*NL*
the
listener
was
veiled
in
an
expression
of
cautious
gravity
.
At
the
*NL*
allusion
to
the
injury
which
Duncan
affected
to
believe
had
driven
*NL*
the
Huron
from
his
native
tribe
,
a
gleam
of
such
ungovernable
ferocity
*NL*
flashed
from
the
other
's
eyes
,
as
induced
the
adventurous
speaker
to
*NL*
believe
he
had
struck
the
proper
chord
.
And
by
the
time
he
reached
*NL*
the
part
where
he
so
artfully
blended
the
thirst
of
vengeance
with
the
*NL*
desire
of
gain
,
he
had
,
at
least
,
obtained
a
command
of
the
deepest
*NL*
attention
of
the
savage
.
The
question
put
by
Le
Renard
had
been
calm
,
*NL*
and
with
all
the
dignity
of
an
Indian
;
but
it
was
quite
apparent
,
by
the
*NL*
thoughtful
expression
of
the
listener
's
countenance
,
that
the
answer
was
*NL*
most
cunningly
devised
.
The
Huron
mused
a
few
moments
,
and
then
laying
*NL*
his
hand
on
the
rude
bandages
of
his
wounded
shoulder
,
he
said
,
with
*NL*
some
energy
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
friends
make
such
marks
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
`
La
Longue
Carbine
'
cut
one
so
slight
on
an
enemy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
the
Delawares
crawl
upon
those
they
love
like
snakes
,
twisting
*NL*
themselves
to
strike
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
`
Le
Gros
Serpent
'
have
been
heard
by
the
ears
of
one
he
wished
to
*NL*
be
deaf
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
the
white
chief
burn
his
powder
in
the
faces
of
his
brothers
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
he
ever
miss
his
aim
,
when
seriously
bent
to
kill
?
''
returned
*NL*
Duncan
,
smiling
with
well
acted
sincerity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Another
long
and
deliberate
pause
succeeded
these
sententious
questions
*NL*
and
ready
replies
.
Duncan
saw
that
the
Indian
hesitated
.
In
order
to
*NL*
complete
his
victory
,
he
was
in
the
act
of
recommencing
the
enumeration
*NL*
of
the
rewards
,
when
Magua
made
an
expressive
gesture
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Enough
;
Le
Renard
is
a
wise
chief
,
and
what
he
does
will
be
seen
.
*NL*
Go
,
and
keep
the
mouth
shut
.
When
Magua
speaks
,
it
will
be
the
time
to
*NL*
answer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Heyward
,
perceiving
that
the
eyes
of
his
companion
were
warily
fastened
*NL*
on
the
rest
of
the
band
,
fell
back
immediately
,
in
order
to
avoid
*NL*
the
appearance
of
any
suspicious
confederacy
with
their
leader
.
*NL*
Magua
approached
the
horses
,
and
affected
to
be
well
pleased
with
the
*NL*
diligence
and
ingenuity
of
his
comrades
.
He
then
signed
to
Heyward
to
*NL*
assist
the
sisters
into
the
saddles
,
for
he
seldom
deigned
to
use
the
*NL*
English
tongue
,
unless
urged
by
some
motive
of
more
than
usual
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
longer
any
plausible
pretext
for
delay
;
and
Duncan
was
*NL*
obliged
,
however
reluctantly
,
to
comply
.
As
he
performed
this
office
,
he
*NL*
whispered
his
reviving
hopes
in
the
ears
of
the
trembling
females
,
who
,
*NL*
through
dread
of
encountering
the
savage
countenances
of
their
captors
,
*NL*
seldom
raised
their
eyes
from
the
ground
.
The
mare
of
David
had
been
*NL*
taken
with
the
followers
of
the
large
chief
;
in
consequence
,
its
owner
,
*NL*
as
well
as
Duncan
,
was
compelled
to
journey
on
foot
.
The
latter
did
not
,
*NL*
however
,
so
much
regret
this
circumstance
,
as
it
might
enable
him
to
*NL*
retard
the
speed
of
the
party
;
for
he
still
turned
his
longing
looks
in
*NL*
the
direction
of
Fort
Edward
,
in
the
vain
expectation
of
catching
some
*NL*
sound
from
that
quarter
of
the
forest
,
which
might
denote
the
approach
*NL*
of
succor
.
When
all
were
prepared
,
Magua
made
the
signal
to
proceed
,
*NL*
advancing
in
front
to
lead
the
party
in
person
.
Next
followed
David
,
who
*NL*
was
gradually
coming
to
a
true
sense
of
his
condition
,
as
the
effects
of
*NL*
the
wound
became
less
and
less
apparent
.
The
sisters
rode
in
his
rear
,
*NL*
with
Heyward
at
their
side
,
while
the
Indians
flanked
the
party
,
and
*NL*
brought
up
the
close
of
the
march
,
with
a
caution
that
seemed
never
to
*NL*
tire
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
manner
they
proceeded
in
uninterrupted
silence
,
except
when
*NL*
Heyward
addressed
some
solitary
word
of
comfort
to
the
females
,
or
David
*NL*
gave
vent
to
the
moanings
of
his
spirit
,
in
piteous
exclamations
,
which
*NL*
he
intended
should
express
the
humility
of
resignation
.
Their
direction
*NL*
lay
toward
the
south
,
and
in
a
course
nearly
opposite
to
the
road
to
*NL*
William
Henry
.
Notwithstanding
this
apparent
adherence
in
Magua
to
the
*NL*
original
determination
of
his
conquerors
,
Heyward
could
not
believe
*NL*
his
tempting
bait
was
so
soon
forgotten
;
and
he
knew
the
windings
of
an
*NL*
Indian
's
path
too
well
to
suppose
that
its
apparent
course
led
directly
*NL*
to
its
object
,
when
artifice
was
at
all
necessary
.
Mile
after
mile
was
,
*NL*
however
,
passed
through
the
boundless
woods
,
in
this
painful
manner
,
*NL*
without
any
prospect
of
a
termination
to
their
journey
.
Heyward
watched
*NL*
the
sun
,
as
he
darted
his
meridian
rays
through
the
branches
of
the
*NL*
trees
,
and
pined
for
the
moment
when
the
policy
of
Magua
should
change
*NL*
their
route
to
one
more
favorable
to
his
hopes
.
Sometimes
he
fancied
the
*NL*
wary
savage
,
despairing
of
passing
the
army
of
Montcalm
in
safety
,
*NL*
was
holding
his
way
toward
a
well-known
border
settlement
,
where
a
*NL*
distinguished
officer
of
the
crown
,
and
a
favored
friend
of
the
Six
*NL*
Nations
,
held
his
large
possessions
,
as
well
as
his
usual
residence
.
To
*NL*
be
delivered
into
the
hands
of
Sir
William
Johnson
was
far
preferable
*NL*
to
being
led
into
the
wilds
of
Canada
;
but
in
order
to
effect
even
the
*NL*
former
,
it
would
be
necessary
to
traverse
the
forest
for
many
weary
*NL*
leagues
,
each
step
of
which
was
carrying
him
further
from
the
scene
of
*NL*
the
war
,
and
,
consequently
,
from
the
post
,
not
only
of
honor
,
but
of
*NL*
duty
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cora
alone
remembered
the
parting
injunctions
of
the
scout
,
and
whenever
*NL*
an
opportunity
offered
,
she
stretched
forth
her
arm
to
bend
aside
the
*NL*
twigs
that
met
her
hands
.
But
the
vigilance
of
the
Indians
rendered
this
*NL*
act
of
precaution
both
difficult
and
dangerous
.
She
was
often
defeated
*NL*
in
her
purpose
,
by
encountering
their
watchful
eyes
,
when
it
became
*NL*
necessary
to
feign
an
alarm
she
did
not
feel
,
and
occupy
the
limb
by
*NL*
some
gesture
of
feminine
apprehension
.
Once
,
and
once
only
,
was
she
*NL*
completely
successful
;
when
she
broke
down
the
bough
of
a
large
sumach
,
*NL*
and
by
a
sudden
thought
,
let
her
glove
fall
at
the
same
instant
.
This
*NL*
sign
,
intended
for
those
that
might
follow
,
was
observed
by
one
of
her
*NL*
conductors
,
who
restored
the
glove
,
broke
the
remaining
branches
of
the
*NL*
bush
in
such
a
manner
that
it
appeared
to
proceed
from
the
struggling
of
*NL*
some
beast
in
its
branches
,
and
then
laid
his
hand
on
his
tomahawk
,
*NL*
with
a
look
so
significant
,
that
it
put
an
effectual
end
to
these
stolen
*NL*
memorials
of
their
passage
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
there
were
horses
,
to
leave
the
prints
of
their
footsteps
,
in
both
*NL*
bands
of
the
Indians
,
this
interruption
cut
off
any
probable
hopes
of
*NL*
assistance
being
conveyed
through
the
means
of
their
trail
.
*NL*
*NL*
Heyward
would
have
ventured
a
remonstrance
had
there
been
anything
*NL*
encouraging
in
the
gloomy
reserve
of
Magua
.
But
the
savage
,
during
all
*NL*
this
time
,
seldom
turned
to
look
at
his
followers
,
and
never
spoke
.
With
*NL*
the
sun
for
his
only
guide
,
or
aided
by
such
blind
marks
as
are
only
*NL*
known
to
the
sagacity
of
a
native
,
he
held
his
way
along
the
barrens
*NL*
of
pine
,
through
occasional
little
fertile
vales
,
across
brooks
and
*NL*
rivulets
,
and
over
undulating
hills
,
with
the
accuracy
of
instinct
,
*NL*
and
nearly
with
the
directness
of
a
bird
.
He
never
seemed
to
hesitate
.
*NL*
Whether
the
path
was
hardly
distinguishable
,
whether
it
disappeared
,
or
*NL*
whether
it
lay
beaten
and
plain
before
him
,
made
no
sensible
difference
*NL*
in
his
speed
or
certainty
.
It
seemed
as
if
fatigue
could
not
affect
him
.
*NL*
Whenever
the
eyes
of
the
wearied
travelers
rose
from
the
decayed
leaves
*NL*
over
which
they
trod
,
his
dark
form
was
to
be
seen
glancing
among
the
*NL*
stems
of
the
trees
in
front
,
his
head
immovably
fastened
in
a
forward
*NL*
position
,
with
the
light
plume
on
his
crest
fluttering
in
a
current
of
*NL*
air
,
made
solely
by
the
swiftness
of
his
own
motion
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
all
this
diligence
and
speed
were
not
without
an
object
.
After
*NL*
crossing
a
low
vale
,
through
which
a
gushing
brook
meandered
,
he
*NL*
suddenly
ascended
a
hill
,
so
steep
and
difficult
of
ascent
,
that
the
*NL*
sisters
were
compelled
to
alight
in
order
to
follow
.
When
the
summit
was
*NL*
gained
,
they
found
themselves
on
a
level
spot
,
but
thinly
covered
with
*NL*
trees
,
under
one
of
which
Magua
had
thrown
his
dark
form
,
as
if
willing
*NL*
and
ready
to
seek
that
rest
which
was
so
much
needed
by
the
whole
party

CHAPTER
11
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cursed
be
my
tribe
If
I
forgive
him
.
''
*NL*
--
Shylock
*NL*
*NL*
The
Indian
had
selected
for
this
desirable
purpose
one
of
those
steep
,
*NL*
pyramidal
hills
,
which
bear
a
strong
resemblance
to
artificial
mounds
,
*NL*
and
which
so
frequently
occur
in
the
valleys
of
America
.
The
one
in
*NL*
question
was
high
and
precipitous
;
its
top
flattened
,
as
usual
;
but
with
*NL*
one
of
its
sides
more
than
ordinarily
irregular
.
It
possessed
no
other
*NL*
apparent
advantage
for
a
resting
place
,
than
in
its
elevation
and
form
,
*NL*
which
might
render
defense
easy
,
and
surprise
nearly
impossible
.
As
*NL*
Heyward
,
however
,
no
longer
expected
that
rescue
which
time
and
distance
*NL*
now
rendered
so
improbable
,
he
regarded
these
little
peculiarities
with
*NL*
an
eye
devoid
of
interest
,
devoting
himself
entirely
to
the
comfort
and
*NL*
condolence
of
his
feebler
companions
.
The
Narragansetts
were
suffered
*NL*
to
browse
on
the
branches
of
the
trees
and
shrubs
that
were
thinly
*NL*
scattered
over
the
summit
of
the
hill
,
while
the
remains
of
their
*NL*
provisions
were
spread
under
the
shade
of
a
beech
,
that
stretched
its
*NL*
horizontal
limbs
like
a
canopy
above
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Notwithstanding
the
swiftness
of
their
flight
,
one
of
the
Indians
had
*NL*
found
an
opportunity
to
strike
a
straggling
fawn
with
an
arrow
,
and
*NL*
had
borne
the
more
preferable
fragments
of
the
victim
,
patiently
on
his
*NL*
shoulders
,
to
the
stopping
place
.
Without
any
aid
from
the
science
of
*NL*
cookery
,
he
was
immediately
employed
,
in
common
with
his
fellows
,
in
*NL*
gorging
himself
with
this
digestible
sustenance
.
Magua
alone
sat
apart
,
*NL*
without
participating
in
the
revolting
meal
,
and
apparently
buried
in
*NL*
the
deepest
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
abstinence
,
so
remarkable
in
an
Indian
,
when
he
possessed
the
means
*NL*
of
satisfying
hunger
,
at
length
attracted
the
notice
of
Heyward
.
The
*NL*
young
man
willingly
believed
that
the
Huron
deliberated
on
the
most
*NL*
eligible
manner
of
eluding
the
vigilance
of
his
associates
.
With
a
view
*NL*
to
assist
his
plans
by
any
suggestion
of
his
own
,
and
to
strengthen
the
*NL*
temptation
,
he
left
the
beech
,
and
straggled
,
as
if
without
an
object
,
*NL*
to
the
spot
where
Le
Renard
was
seated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
not
Magua
kept
the
sun
in
his
face
long
enough
to
escape
all
danger
*NL*
from
the
Canadians
?
''
he
asked
,
as
though
no
longer
doubtful
of
the
*NL*
good
intelligence
established
between
them
;
``
and
will
not
the
chief
*NL*
of
William
Henry
be
better
pleased
to
see
his
daughters
before
another
*NL*
night
may
have
hardened
his
heart
to
their
loss
,
to
make
him
less
*NL*
liberal
in
his
reward
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
the
pale
faces
love
their
children
less
in
the
morning
than
at
*NL*
night
?
''
asked
the
Indian
,
coldly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
no
means
,
''
returned
Heyward
,
anxious
to
recall
his
error
,
if
he
had
*NL*
made
one
;
``
the
white
man
may
,
and
does
often
,
forget
the
burial
place
of
*NL*
his
fathers
;
he
sometimes
ceases
to
remember
those
he
should
love
,
and
*NL*
has
promised
to
cherish
;
but
the
affection
of
a
parent
for
his
child
is
*NL*
never
permitted
to
die
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
is
the
heart
of
the
white-headed
chief
soft
,
and
will
he
think
of
*NL*
the
babes
that
his
squaws
have
given
him
?
He
is
hard
on
his
warriors
and
*NL*
his
eyes
are
made
of
stone
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
severe
to
the
idle
and
wicked
,
but
to
the
sober
and
deserving
*NL*
he
is
a
leader
,
both
just
and
humane
.
I
have
known
many
fond
and
tender
*NL*
parents
,
but
never
have
I
seen
a
man
whose
heart
was
softer
toward
his
*NL*
child
.
You
have
seen
the
gray-head
in
front
of
his
warriors
,
Magua
;
but
*NL*
I
have
seen
his
eyes
swimming
in
water
,
when
he
spoke
of
those
children
*NL*
who
are
now
in
your
power
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Heyward
paused
,
for
he
knew
not
how
to
construe
the
remarkable
*NL*
expression
that
gleamed
across
the
swarthy
features
of
the
attentive
*NL*
Indian
.
At
first
it
seemed
as
if
the
remembrance
of
the
promised
reward
*NL*
grew
vivid
in
his
mind
,
while
he
listened
to
the
sources
of
parental
*NL*
feeling
which
were
to
assure
its
possession
;
but
,
as
Duncan
proceeded
,
*NL*
the
expression
of
joy
became
so
fiercely
malignant
that
it
was
*NL*
impossible
not
to
apprehend
it
proceeded
from
some
passion
more
sinister
*NL*
than
avarice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
,
''
said
the
Huron
,
suppressing
the
alarming
exhibition
in
an
*NL*
instant
,
in
a
death-like
calmness
of
countenance
;
``
go
to
the
dark-haired
*NL*
daughter
,
and
say
,
`
Magua
waits
to
speak
'
The
father
will
remember
what
*NL*
the
child
promises
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Duncan
,
who
interpreted
this
speech
to
express
a
wish
for
some
*NL*
additional
pledge
that
the
promised
gifts
should
not
be
withheld
,
slowly
*NL*
and
reluctantly
repaired
to
the
place
where
the
sisters
were
now
resting
*NL*
from
their
fatigue
,
to
communicate
its
purport
to
Cora
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
understand
the
nature
of
an
Indian
's
wishes
,
''
he
concluded
,
as
he
*NL*
led
her
toward
the
place
where
she
was
expected
,
``
and
must
be
prodigal
*NL*
of
your
offers
of
powder
and
blankets
.
Ardent
spirits
are
,
however
,
the
*NL*
most
prized
by
such
as
he
;
nor
would
it
be
amiss
to
add
some
boon
*NL*
from
your
own
hand
,
with
that
grace
you
so
well
know
how
to
practise
.
*NL*
Remember
,
Cora
,
that

your
presence
of
mind
and
ingenuity
,
even
your
*NL*
life

as
well

in
some
measure
depend

*NL*
*NL*
``
Heyward

yours

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mine
is
of
little

seized
by
any
enemy

may
possess

I
have
no

few

lament
a
fate

I
have
courted

insatiable

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Indian
rose
slowly
from
his
seat
,
and
stood
for
near
a
minute
silent
*NL*
and
motionless
.
He
then
signed
with
his
hand
for
Heyward
to
retire
,
*NL*
saying
,
coldly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
the
Huron
talks
to
the
women

his
tribe
shut
their
ears

*NL*
*NL*
Duncan
,
still
lingering
,
as
if
refusing
to
comply
,
Cora
said
,
with
a
*NL*
calm
smile
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
hear
,
Heyward

delicacy
at

comfort
her
with
our
reviving
prospects

''
*NL*
*NL*
She
waited
until
he
had
departed
,
and
then
turning
to
the
native
,
with
*NL*
the
dignity
of
her
sex
in
her
voice
and
manner
,
she
added
:
``
What
would
*NL*
Le
Renard
say
to
the
daughter
of
Munro
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
,
''
said
the
Indian
,
laying
his
hand
firmly
upon
her
arm
,
as
if
*NL*
willing
to
draw
her
utmost
attention
to
his
words
;
a
movement
that
Cora
*NL*
as
firmly
but
quietly
repulsed
,
by
extricating
the
limb
from
his
grasp
:
*NL*
``
Magua
was
born
a
chief
and
a
warrior
among
the
red
Hurons
of
the
lakes
;
*NL*
he
saw
the
suns
of
twenty
summers
make
the
snows
of
twenty
winters
run
*NL*
off
in
the
streams
before
he
saw
a
pale
face
;
and
he
was
happy
!
Then
*NL*
his
Canada
fathers
came
into
the
woods
,
and
taught
him
to
drink
the
*NL*
fire-water
,
and
he
became
a
rascal
.
The
Hurons
drove
him
from
the
graves
*NL*
of
his
fathers
,
as
they
would
chase
the
hunted
buffalo
.
He
ran
down
the
*NL*
shores
of
the
lakes
,
and
followed
their
outlet
to
the
`
city
of
cannon
'
*NL*
There
he
hunted
and
fished
,
till
the
people
chased
him
again
through
the
*NL*
woods
into
the
arms
of
his
enemies
.
The
chief
,
who
was
born
a
Huron
,
was
*NL*
at
last
a
warrior
among
the
Mohawks
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Something
like
this
I
had
heard
before
,
''
said
Cora
,
observing
that
he
*NL*
paused
to
suppress
those
passions
which
began
to
burn
with
too
bright
a
*NL*
flame
,
as
he
recalled
the
recollection
of
his
supposed
injuries
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
it
the
fault
of
Le
Renard
that
his
head
was
not
made
of
rock
?
Who
*NL*
gave
him
the
fire-water
?
who
made
him
a
villain

'T

the
pale

*NL*
the
people
of
your
own
color

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
am
I
answerable
that
thoughtless
and
unprincipled
men
exist
,
whose
*NL*
shades
of
countenance
may
resemble
mine

''
Cora
calmly
demanded
of
the
*NL*
excited
savage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
Magua
is
a
man
,
and
not
a
fool
;
such
as
you
never
open
their
lips
*NL*
to
the
burning
stream
:
the
Great
Spirit
has
given
you
wisdom
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
then
,
have
I
do
to
,
or
say
,
in
the
matter
of
your
misfortunes
,
*NL*
not
to
say
of
your
errors
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
,
''
repeated
the
Indian
,
resuming
his
earnest
attitude
;
``
when
*NL*
his
English
and
French
fathers
dug
up
the
hatchet
,
Le
Renard
struck
the
*NL*
war-post
of
the
Mohawks
,
and
went
out
against
his
own
nation
.
The
pale
*NL*
faces
have
driven
the
red-skins
from
their
hunting
grounds
,
and
now
when
*NL*
they
fight
,
a
white
man
leads
the
way
.
The
old
chief
at
Horican
,
your
*NL*
father
,
was
the
great
captain
of
our
war-party
.
He
said
to
the
Mohawks
*NL*
do
this
,
and
do
that
,
and
he
was
minded
.
He
made
a
law
,
that
if
an
*NL*
Indian
swallowed
the
fire-water
,
and
came
into
the
cloth
wigwams
of
his
*NL*
warriors
,
it
should
not
be
forgotten
.
Magua
foolishly
opened
his
*NL*
mouth
,
and
the
hot
liquor
led
him
into
the
cabin
of
Munro
.
What
did
the
*NL*
gray-head
?
let
his
daughter
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
forgot
not
his
words

did
justice

by
punishing
the
offender

*NL*
said
the
undaunted
daughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Justice
!
''
repeated
the
Indian
,
casting
an
oblique
glance
of
the
most
*NL*
ferocious
expression
at
her
unyielding
countenance
;
``
is
it
justice
to
*NL*
make
evil
and
then
punish
for
it
?
Magua
was
not
himself
;
it
was
the
*NL*
fire-water
that
spoke
and
acted
for
him
!
but
Munro
did
believe
it
.
The
*NL*
Huron
chief
was
tied
up
before
all
the
pale-faced
warriors
,
and
whipped
*NL*
like
a
dog
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Cora
remained
silent
,
for
she
knew
not
how
to
palliate
this
imprudent
*NL*
severity
on
the
part
of
her
father
in
a
manner
to
suit
the
comprehension
*NL*
of
an
Indian
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
See
!
''
continued
Magua
,
tearing
aside
the
slight
calico
that
very
*NL*
imperfectly
concealed
his
painted
breast
;
``
here
are
scars
given
by
*NL*
knives
and
bullets
--
of
these
a
warrior
may
boast
before
his
nation
;
but
*NL*
the
gray-head
has
left
marks
on
the
back
of
the
Huron
chief
that
he
must
*NL*
hide
like
a
squaw
,
under
this
painted
cloth
of
the
whites
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
thought
,
''
resumed
Cora
,
``
that
an
Indian
warrior
was
patient
,
and
*NL*
that
his
spirit
felt
not
and
knew
not
the
pain
his
body
suffered

*NL*
*NL*
``
When
the
Chippewas
tied
Magua
to
the
stake

cut
this
gash

said
*NL*
the
other
,
laying
his
finger
on
a
deep
scar
,
``
the
Huron
laughed
in
their
*NL*
faces

told
them

struck
so
light

His
spirit
was
then
in
the
*NL*
clouds
!
But
when
he
felt
the
blows
of
Munro
,
his
spirit
lay
under
the
*NL*
birch
.
The
spirit
of
a
Huron
is
never
drunk
;
it
remembers
forever
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
may
be
appeased
.
If
my
father
has
done
you
this
injustice

show
*NL*
him
how
an
Indian
can
forgive
an
injury
,
and
take
back
his
daughters

*NL*
You
have
heard
from
Major
Heyward

*NL*
*NL*
Magua
shook
his
head
,
forbidding
the
repetition
of
offers
he
so
much
*NL*
despised
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
would
you
have
?
''
continued
Cora
,
after
a
most
painful
pause
,
*NL*
while
the
conviction
forced
itself
on
her
mind
that
the
too
sanguine
and
*NL*
generous
Duncan
had
been
cruelly
deceived
by
the
cunning
of
the
savage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
Huron
loves
--
good
for
good
;
bad
for
bad

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
would
,
then

revenge
the
injury
inflicted
by
Munro
on
his
helpless
*NL*
daughters

Would
it
not
be
more
like
a
man
to
go
before
his
face

*NL*
take
the
satisfaction
of
a
warrior
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
arms

pale
faces
are
long

their
knives
sharp

returned
*NL*
the
savage
,
with
a
malignant
laugh
:
``
why
should
Le
Renard
go
among
the
*NL*
muskets

his
warriors

gray-head

*NL*
*NL*
``

Cora
,
struggling
with
herself
to
*NL*
speak
with
steady
calmness
.
``
Is
it
to
lead
us
prisoners
to
the
woods
,
or
*NL*
do
you
contemplate
even
some
greater
evil
?
Is
there
no
reward
,
no
means
*NL*
of
palliating
the
injury
,
and
of
softening
your
heart
?
At
least
,
release
*NL*
my
gentle
sister
,
and
pour
out
all
your
malice
on
me
.
Purchase
wealth
*NL*
by
her
safety
and
satisfy
your
revenge
with
a
single
victim
.
The
loss
*NL*
of
both
his
daughters
might
bring
the
aged
man
to
his
grave
,
and
where
*NL*
would
then
be
the
satisfaction
of
Le
Renard
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
,
''
said
the
Indian
again
.
``
The
light
eyes
can
go
back
to
the
*NL*
Horican
,
and
tell
the
old
chief
what
has
been
done
,
if
the
dark-haired
*NL*
woman
will
swear
by
the
Great
Spirit
of
her
fathers
to
tell
no
lie
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
must
I
promise
?
''
demanded
Cora
,
still
maintaining
a
secret
*NL*
ascendancy
over
the
fierce
native
by
the
collected
and
feminine
dignity
*NL*
of
her
presence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
Magua
left
his
people
his
wife
was
given
to
another
chief
;
he
has
*NL*
now
made
friends
with
the
Hurons
,
and
will
go
back
to
the
graves
of
his
*NL*
tribe
,
on
the
shores
of
the
great
lake
.
Let
the
daughter
of
the
English
*NL*
chief
follow
,
and
live
in
his
wigwam
forever
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
However
revolting
a
proposal
of
such
a
character
might
prove
to
*NL*
Cora
,
she
retained
,
notwithstanding
her
powerful
disgust
,
sufficient
*NL*
self-command
to
reply
,
without
betraying
the
weakness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
pleasure
would
Magua
find
in
sharing
his
cabin
with
a
wife
he
*NL*
did
not
love
;
one
who
would
be
of
a
nation
and
color
different
from
his
*NL*
own
?
It
would
be
better
to
take
the
gold
of
Munro
,
and
buy
the
heart
of
*NL*
some
Huron
maid
with
his
gifts
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Indian
made
no
reply
for
near
a
minute
,
but
bent
his
fierce
looks
*NL*
on
the
countenance
of
Cora
,
in
such
wavering
glances
,
that
her
eyes
*NL*
sank
with
shame
,
under
an
impression
that
for
the
first
time
they
had
*NL*
encountered
an
expression
that
no
chaste
female
might
endure
.
While
she
*NL*
was
shrinking
within
herself
,
in
dread
of
having
her
ears
wounded
by
*NL*
some
proposal
still
more
shocking
than
the
last
,
the
voice
of
Magua
*NL*
answered
,
in
its
tones
of
deepest
malignancy
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
the
blows
scorched
the
back
of
the
Huron
,
he
would
know
where
to
*NL*
find
a
woman
to
feel
the
smart
.
The
daughter
of
Munro
would
draw
his
*NL*
water
,
hoe
his
corn
,
and
cook
his
venison
.
The
body
of
the
gray-head
*NL*
would
sleep
among
his
cannon
,
but
his
heart
would
lie
within
reach
of
*NL*
the
knife
of
Le
Subtil
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monster
!
well
dost
thou
deserve
thy
treacherous
name
,
''
cried
Cora
,
in
*NL*
an
ungovernable
burst
of
filial
indignation
.
``
None
but
a
fiend
could
*NL*
meditate
such
a
vengeance
.
But
thou
overratest
thy
power
!
You
shall
find
*NL*
it
is
,
in
truth
,
the
heart
of
Munro
you
hold
,
and
that
it
will
defy
your
*NL*
utmost
malice
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Indian
answered
this
bold
defiance
by
a
ghastly
smile
,
that
showed
*NL*
an
unaltered
purpose
,
while
he
motioned
her
away
,
as
if
to
close
the
*NL*
conference
forever
.
Cora
,
already
regretting
her
precipitation
,
was
*NL*
obliged
to
comply
,
for
Magua
instantly
left
the
spot
,
and
approached
his
*NL*
gluttonous
comrades
.
Heyward
flew
to
the
side
of
the
agitated
female
,
*NL*
and
demanded
the
result
of
a
dialogue
that
he
had
watched
at
a
distance
*NL*
with
so
much
interest
.
But
,
unwilling
to
alarm
the
fears
of
Alice
,
she
*NL*
evaded
a
direct
reply
,
betraying
only
by
her
anxious
looks
fastened
on
*NL*
the
slightest
movements
of
her
captors
.
To
the
reiterated
and
earnest
*NL*
questions
of
her
sister
concerning
their
probable
destination
,
she
*NL*
made
no
other
answer
than
by
pointing
toward
the
dark
group
,
with
an
*NL*
agitation
she
could
not
control
,
and
murmuring
as
she
folded
Alice
to
*NL*
her
bosom
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
there
;
read
our
fortunes
in
their
faces
;
we
shall
see
;
we
shall
*NL*
see
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
action
,
and
the
choked
utterance
of
Cora
,
spoke
more
impressively
*NL*
than
any
words
,
and
quickly
drew
the
attention
of
her
companions
on
that
*NL*
spot
where
her
own
was
riveted
with
an
intenseness
that
nothing
but
the
*NL*
importance
of
the
stake
could
create
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Magua
reached
the
cluster
of
lolling
savages
,
who
,
gorged
with
*NL*
their
disgusting
meal
,
lay
stretched
on
the
earth
in
brutal
indulgence
,
*NL*
he
commenced
speaking
with
the
dignity
of
an
Indian
chief
.
The
first
*NL*
syllables
he
uttered
had
the
effect
to
cause
his
listeners
to
raise
*NL*
themselves
in
attitudes
of
respectful
attention
.
As
the
Huron
used
*NL*
his
native
language
,
the
prisoners
,
notwithstanding
the
caution
of
the
*NL*
natives
had
kept
them
within
the
swing
of
their
tomahawks
,
could
only
*NL*
conjecture
the
substance
of
his
harangue
from
the
nature
of
those
*NL*
significant
gestures
with
which
an
Indian
always
illustrates
his
*NL*
eloquence
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
first
,
the
language
,
as
well
as
the
action
of
Magua
,
appeared
calm
*NL*
and
deliberative
.
When
he
had
succeeded
in
sufficiently
awakening
*NL*
the
attention
of
his
comrades
,
Heyward
fancied
,
by
his
pointing
so
*NL*
frequently
toward
the
direction
of
the
great
lakes
,
that
he
spoke
of
the
*NL*
land
of
their
fathers
,
and
of
their
distant
tribe
.
Frequent
indications
*NL*
of
applause
escaped
the
listeners
,
who
,
as
they
uttered
the
expressive
*NL*
``
Hugh
!
''
looked
at
each
other
in
commendation
of
the
speaker
.
Le
Renard
*NL*
was
too
skillful
to
neglect
his
advantage
.
He
now
spoke
of
the
long
and
*NL*
painful
route
by
which
they
had
left
those
spacious
grounds
and
happy
*NL*
villages
,
to
come
and
battle
against
the
enemies
of
their
Canadian
*NL*
fathers
.
He
enumerated
the
warriors
of
the
party
;
their
several
merits
;
*NL*
their
frequent
services
to
the
nation
;
their
wounds
,
and
the
number
of
*NL*
the
scalps
they
had
taken
.
Whenever
he
alluded
to
any
present
-LRB-
and
the
*NL*
subtle
Indian
neglected
none
-RRB-
,
the
dark
countenance
of
the
flattered
*NL*
individual
gleamed
with
exultation
,
nor
did
he
even
hesitate
to
assert
*NL*
the
truth
of
the
words
,
by
gestures
of
applause
and
confirmation
.
Then
*NL*
the
voice
of
the
speaker
fell
,
and
lost
the
loud
,
animated
tones
of
*NL*
triumph
with
which
he
had
enumerated
their
deeds
of
success
and
victory
.
*NL*
He
described
the
cataract
of
Glenn
's
;
the
impregnable
position
of
its
*NL*
rocky
island
,
with
its
caverns
and
its
numerous
rapids
and
whirlpools
;
*NL*
he
named
the
name
of
``
La
Longue
Carabine
,
''
and
paused
until
the
forest
*NL*
beneath
them
had
sent
up
the
last
echo
of
a
loud
and
long
yell
,
with
*NL*
which
the
hated
appellation
was
received
.
He
pointed
toward
the
youthful
*NL*
military
captive
,
and
described
the
death
of
a
favorite
warrior
,
who
*NL*
had
been
precipitated
into
the
deep
ravine
by
his
hand
.
He
not
only
*NL*
mentioned
the
fate
of
him
who
,
hanging
between
heaven
and
earth
,
had
*NL*
presented
such
a
spectacle
of
horror
to
the
whole
band
,
but
he
acted
*NL*
anew
the
terrors
of
his
situation
,
his
resolution
and
his
death
,
on
the
*NL*
branches
of
a
sapling
;
and
,
finally
,
he
rapidly
recounted
the
manner
*NL*
in
which
each
of
their
friends
had
fallen
,
never
failing
to
touch
upon
*NL*
their
courage
,
and
their
most
acknowledged
virtues
.
When
this
recital
of
*NL*
events
was
ended
,
his
voice
once
more
changed
,
and
became
plaintive
and
*NL*
even
musical
,
in
its
low
guttural
sounds
.
He
now
spoke
of
the
wives
and
*NL*
children
of
the
slain
;
their
destitution
;
their
misery
,
both
physical
*NL*
and
moral
;
their
distance
;
and
,
at
last
,
of
their
unavenged
wrongs
.
Then
*NL*
suddenly
lifting
his
voice
to
a
pitch
of
terrific
energy
,
he
concluded
*NL*
by
demanding
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
the
Hurons
dogs
to
bear
this
?
Who
shall
say
to
the
wife
of
Menowgua
*NL*
that
the
fishes
have
his
scalp
,
and
that
his
nation
have
not
taken
*NL*
revenge
!
Who
will
dare
meet
the
mother
of
Wassawattimie
,
that
scornful
*NL*
woman
,
with
his
hands
clean
!
What
shall
be
said
to
the
old
men
when
*NL*
they
ask
us
for
scalps
,
and
we
have
not
a
hair
from
a
white
head
to
give
*NL*
them
!
The
women
will
point
their
fingers
at
us
.
There
is
a
dark
spot
on
*NL*
the
names
of
the
Hurons
,
and
it
must
be
hid
in
blood
!
''
His
voice
was
no
*NL*
longer
audible
in
the
burst
of
rage
which
now
broke
into
the
air
,
as
*NL*
if
the
wood
,
instead
of
containing
so
small
a
band
,
was
filled
with
the
*NL*
nation
.
During
the
foregoing
address
the
progress
of
the
speaker
was
too
*NL*
plainly
read
by
those
most
interested
in
his
success
through
the
medium
*NL*
of
the
countenances
of
the
men
he
addressed
.
They
had
answered
his
*NL*
melancholy
and
mourning
by
sympathy
and
sorrow
;
his
assertions
,
by
*NL*
gestures
of
confirmation
;
and
his
boasting
,
with
the
exultation
of
*NL*
savages
.
When
he
spoke
of
courage
,
their
looks
were
firm
and
responsive
;
*NL*
when
he
alluded
to
their
injuries
,
their
eyes
kindled
with
fury
;
when
*NL*
he
mentioned
the
taunts
of
the
women
,
they
dropped
their
heads
in
shame
;
*NL*
but
when
he
pointed
out
their
means
of
vengeance
,
he
struck
a
chord
*NL*
which
never
failed
to
thrill
in
the
breast
of
an
Indian
.
With
the
first
*NL*
intimation
that
it
was
within
their
reach
,
the
whole
band
sprang
upon
*NL*
their
feet
as
one
man
;
giving
utterance
to
their
rage
in
the
most
*NL*
frantic
cries
,
they
rushed
upon
their
prisoners
in
a
body
with
drawn
*NL*
knives
and
uplifted
tomahawks
.
Heyward
threw
himself
between
the
sisters
*NL*
and
the
foremost
,
whom
he
grappled
with
a
desperate
strength
that
for
a
*NL*
moment
checked
his
violence
.
This
unexpected
resistance
gave
Magua
time
*NL*
to
interpose
,
and
with
rapid
enunciation
and
animated
gesture
,
he
drew
*NL*
the
attention
of
the
band
again
to
himself
.
In
that
language
he
knew
so
*NL*
well
how
to
assume
,
he
diverted
his
comrades
from
their
instant
purpose
,
*NL*
and
invited
them
to
prolong
the
misery
of
their
victims
.
His
proposal
*NL*
was
received
with
acclamations
,
and
executed
with
the
swiftness
of
*NL*
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
powerful
warriors
cast
themselves
on
Heyward
,
while
another
was
*NL*
occupied
in
securing
the
less
active
singing-master
.
Neither
of
the
*NL*
captives
,
however
,
submitted
without
a
desperate
,
though
fruitless
,
*NL*
struggle
.
Even
David
hurled
his
assailant
to
the
earth
;
nor
was
Heyward
*NL*
secured
until
the
victory
over
his
companion
enabled
the
Indians
to
*NL*
direct
their
united
force
to
that
object
.
He
was
then
bound
and
fastened
*NL*
to
the
body
of
the
sapling
,
on
whose
branches
Magua
had
acted
the
*NL*
pantomime
of
the
falling
Huron
.
When
the
young
soldier
regained
his
*NL*
recollection
,
he
had
the
painful
certainty
before
his
eyes
that
a
*NL*
common
fate
was
intended
for
the
whole
party
.
On
his
right
was
Cora
in
*NL*
a
durance
similar
to
his
own
,
pale
and
agitated
,
but
with
an
eye
whose
*NL*
steady
look
still
read
the
proceedings
of
their
enemies
.
On
his
left
,
*NL*
the
withes
which
bound
her
to
a
pine
,
performed
that
office
for
Alice
*NL*
which
her
trembling
limbs
refused
,
and
alone
kept
her
fragile
form
from
*NL*
sinking
.
Her
hands
were
clasped
before
her
in
prayer
,
but
instead
of
*NL*
looking
upward
toward
that
power
which
alone
could
rescue
them
,
her
*NL*
unconscious
looks
wandered
to
the
countenance
of
Duncan
with
infantile
*NL*
dependency
.
David
had
contended
,
and
the
novelty
of
the
circumstance
*NL*
held
him
silent
,
in
deliberation
on
the
propriety
of
the
unusual
*NL*
occurrence
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
vengeance
of
the
Hurons
had
now
taken
a
new
direction
,
and
they
*NL*
prepared
to
execute
it
with
that
barbarous
ingenuity
with
which
they
*NL*
were
familiarized
by
the
practise
of
centuries
.
Some
sought
knots
,
to
*NL*
raise
the
blazing
pile
;
one
was
riving
the
splinters
of
pine
,
in
order
*NL*
to
pierce
the
flesh
of
their
captives
with
the
burning
fragments
;
and
*NL*
others
bent
the
tops
of
two
saplings
to
the
earth
,
in
order
to
suspend
*NL*
Heyward
by
the
arms
between
the
recoiling
branches
.
But
the
vengeance
of
*NL*
Magua
sought
a
deeper
and
more
malignant
enjoyment
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
the
less
refined
monsters
of
the
band
prepared
,
before
the
eyes
of
*NL*
those
who
were
to
suffer
,
these
well-known
and
vulgar
means
of
torture
,
*NL*
he
approached
Cora
,
and
pointed
out
,
with
the
most
malign
expression
of
*NL*
countenance
,
the
speedy
fate
that
awaited
her
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ha
!
''
he
added
,
``
what
says
the
daughter
of
Munro
?
Her
head
is
too
good
*NL*
to
find
a
pillow
in
the
wigwam
of
Le
Renard
;
will
she
like
it
better
*NL*
when
it
rolls
about
this
hill
a
plaything
for
the
wolves
?
Her
bosom
*NL*
can
not
nurse
the
children
of
a
Huron
;
she
will
see
it
spit
upon
by
*NL*
Indians
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
means
the
monster
!
''
demanded
the
astonished
Heyward
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
!
''
was
the
firm
reply
.
``
He
is
a
savage
,
a
barbarous
and
ignorant
*NL*
savage
,
and
knows
not
what
he
does
.
Let
us
find
leisure
,
with
our
dying
*NL*
breath
,
to
ask
for
him
penitence
and
pardon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pardon
!
''
echoed
the
fierce
Huron
,
mistaking
in
his
anger
,
the
meaning
*NL*
of
her
words
;
``
the
memory
of
an
Indian
is
no
longer
than
the
arm
of
the
*NL*
pale
faces
;
his
mercy
shorter
than
their
justice
!
Say
;
shall
I
send
the
*NL*
yellow
hair
to
her
father
,
and
will
you
follow
Magua
to
the
great
lakes
,
*NL*
to
carry
his
water
,
and
feed
him
with
corn
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Cora
beckoned
him
away
,
with
an
emotion
of
disgust
she
could
not
*NL*
control
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Leave
me
,
''
she
said
,
with
a
solemnity
that
for
a
moment
checked
the
*NL*
barbarity
of
the
Indian
;
``
you
mingle
bitterness
in
my
prayers
;
you
stand
*NL*
between
me
and
my
God
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
slight
impression
produced
on
the
savage
was
,
however
,
soon
*NL*
forgotten
,
and
he
continued
pointing
,
with
taunting
irony
,
toward
Alice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
!
the
child
weeps
!
She
is
too
young
to
die
!
Send
her
to
Munro
,
to
*NL*
comb
his
gray
hairs
,
and
keep
life
in
the
heart
of
the
old
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Cora
could
not
resist
the
desire
to
look
upon
her
youthful
sister
,
in
*NL*
whose
eyes
she
met
an
imploring
glance
,
that
betrayed
the
longings
of
*NL*
nature
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
says
he
,
dearest
Cora
?
''
asked
the
trembling
voice
of
Alice
.
``
Did
*NL*
he
speak
of
sending
me
to
our
father
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
many
moments
the
elder
sister
looked
upon
the
younger
,
with
a
*NL*
countenance
that
wavered
with
powerful
and
contending
emotions
.
*NL*
At
length
she
spoke
,
though
her
tones
had
lost
their
rich
and
calm
*NL*
fullness
,
in
an
expression
of
tenderness
that
seemed
maternal
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alice
,
''
she
said
,
``
the
Huron
offers
us
both
life

nay
,
more
than
both
;
*NL*
he
offers
to

invaluable
Duncan

as
well
as
you
,
to
*NL*
our
friends

to
our

to
our
heart-stricken

childless

*NL*
I

bow

rebellious

stubborn
pride

''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
voice
became
choked
,
and
clasping
her
hands
,
she
looked
upward
,
as
*NL*
if
seeking
,
in
her
agony
,
intelligence
from
a
wisdom
that
was
infinite
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
on

''
cried
Alice
;
``
to
what
,
dearest
Cora

Oh

I
die

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Die

repeated
Cora
,
with
a
calmer
and
firmer
voice
,
``
that
were
easy

*NL*
Perhaps
the
alternative
may
not
be
less
so
.
He
would
have
me

''
she
*NL*
continued
,
her
accents
sinking
under
a
deep
consciousness
of
the
*NL*
degradation
of
the
proposal
,
``
follow
him
to
the
wilderness
;
go
to
the
*NL*
habitations
of
the
Hurons

to
remain
there

in
short
,
to
become
his

Speak

Alice

And
*NL*
you

Major
Heyward

aid
my
weak
reason
with
your
counsel

Is
life
*NL*
to
be
purchased
by
such
a
sacrifice
?
Will
you
,
Alice
,
receive
it
at
my
*NL*
hands
at
such
a
price
?
And
you
,
Duncan
,
guide
me
;
control
me
between
*NL*
you
;
for
I
am
wholly
yours
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
I
!
''
echoed
the
indignant
and
astonished
youth
.
``
Cora
!
Cora
!
you
*NL*
jest
with
our
misery
!
Name
not
the
horrid
alternative
again
;
the
thought
*NL*
itself
is
worse
than
a
thousand
deaths
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
such
would
be
your
answer
,
I
well
knew
!
''
exclaimed
Cora
,
her
*NL*
cheeks
flushing
,
and
her
dark
eyes
once
more
sparkling
with
the
*NL*
lingering
emotions
of
a
woman
.
``
What
says
my
Alice
?
for
her
will
I
*NL*
submit
without
another
murmur
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Although
both
Heyward
and
Cora
listened
with
painful
suspense
and
the
*NL*
deepest
attention
,
no
sounds
were
heard
in
reply
.
It
appeared
as
if
the
*NL*
delicate
and
sensitive
form
of
Alice
would
shrink
into
itself
,
as
she
*NL*
listened
to
this
proposal
.
Her
arms
had
fallen
lengthwise
before
her
,
*NL*
the
fingers
moving
in
slight
convulsions
;
her
head
dropped
upon
her
*NL*
bosom
,
and
her
whole
person
seemed
suspended
against
the
tree
,
looking
*NL*
like
some
beautiful
emblem
of
the
wounded
delicacy
of
her
sex
,
devoid
of
*NL*
animation
and
yet
keenly
conscious
.
In
a
few
moments
,
however
,
her
head
*NL*
began
to
move
slowly
,
in
a
sign
of
deep
,
unconquerable
disapprobation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
no
;
better
that
we
die
as
we
have
lived
,
together
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
die
!
''
shouted
Magua
,
hurling
his
tomahawk
with
violence
at
the
*NL*
unresisting
speaker
,
and
gnashing
his
teeth
with
a
rage
that
could
no
*NL*
longer
be
bridled
at
this
sudden
exhibition
of
firmness
in
the
one
he
*NL*
believed
the
weakest
of
the
party
.
The
axe
cleaved
the
air
in
front
of
*NL*
Heyward
,
and
cutting
some
of
the
flowing
ringlets
of
Alice
,
quivered
*NL*
in
the
tree
above
her
head
.
The
sight
maddened
Duncan
to
desperation
.
*NL*
Collecting
all
his
energies
in
one
effort
he
snapped
the
twigs
which
*NL*
bound
him
and
rushed
upon
another
savage
,
who
was
preparing
,
with
loud
*NL*
yells
and
a
more
deliberate
aim
,
to
repeat
the
blow
.
They
encountered
,
*NL*
grappled
,
and
fell
to
the
earth
together
.
The
naked
body
of
his
*NL*
antagonist
afforded
Heyward
no
means
of
holding
his
adversary
,
who
*NL*
glided
from
his
grasp
,
and
rose
again
with
one
knee
on
his
chest
,
*NL*
pressing
him
down
with
the
weight
of
a
giant
.
Duncan
already
saw
the
*NL*
knife
gleaming
in
the
air
,
when
a
whistling
sound
swept
past
him
,
and
*NL*
was
rather
accompanied
than
followed
by
the
sharp
crack
of
a
rifle
.
He
*NL*
felt
his
breast
relieved
from
the
load
it
had
endured
;
he
saw
the
savage
*NL*
expression
of
his
adversary
's
countenance
change
to
a
look
of
vacant
*NL*
wildness
,
when
the
Indian
fell
dead
on
the
faded
leaves
by
his
side
.

Twelfth
Night
*NL*
*NL*
The
Hurons
stood
aghast
at
this
sudden
visitation
of
death
on
one
of
*NL*
their
band
.
But
as
they
regarded
the
fatal
accuracy
of
an
aim
which
had
*NL*
dared
to
immolate
an
enemy
at
so
much
hazard
to
a
friend
,
the
name
*NL*
of
``
La
Longue
Carabine
''
burst
simultaneously
from
every
lip
,
and
was
*NL*
succeeded
by
a
wild
and
a
sort
of
plaintive
howl
.
The
cry
was
answered
*NL*
by
a
loud
shout
from
a
little
thicket
,
where
the
incautious
party
had
*NL*
piled
their
arms
;
and
at
the
next
moment
,
Hawkeye
,
too
eager
to
load
*NL*
the
rifle
he
had
regained
,
was
seen
advancing
upon
them
,
brandishing
the
*NL*
clubbed
weapon
,
and
cutting
the
air
with
wide
and
powerful
sweeps
.
Bold
*NL*
and
rapid
as
was
the
progress
of
the
scout
,
it
was
exceeded
by
that
of
*NL*
a
light
and
vigorous
form
which
,
bounding
past
him
,
leaped
,
with
*NL*
incredible
activity
and
daring
,
into
the
very
center
of
the
Hurons
,
*NL*
where
it
stood
,
whirling
a
tomahawk
,
and
flourishing
a
glittering
knife
,
*NL*
with
fearful
menaces
,
in
front
of
Cora
.
Quicker
than
the
thoughts
could
*NL*
follow
those
unexpected
and
audacious
movements
,
an
image
,
armed
in
the
*NL*
emblematic
panoply
of
death
,
glided
before
their
eyes
,
and
assumed
a
*NL*
threatening
attitude
at
the
other
's
side
.
The
savage
tormentors
recoiled
*NL*
before
these
warlike
intruders
,
and
uttered
,
as
they
appeared
in
such
*NL*
quick
succession
,
the
often
repeated
and
peculiar
exclamations
of
*NL*
surprise
,
followed
by
the
well-known
and
dreaded
appellations
of
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Le
Cerf
Agile
!
Le
Gros
Serpent
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
wary
and
vigilant
leader
of
the
Hurons
was
not
so
easily
*NL*
disconcerted
.
Casting
his
keen
eyes
around
the
little
plain
,
he
*NL*
comprehended
the
nature
of
the
assault
at
a
glance
,
and
encouraging
his
*NL*
followers
by
his
voice
as
well
as
by
his
example
,
he
unsheathed
his
*NL*
long
and
dangerous
knife
,
and
rushed
with
a
loud
whoop
upon
the
expected
*NL*
Chingachgook
.
It
was
the
signal
for
a
general
combat
.
Neither
party
had
*NL*
firearms
,
and
the
contest
was
to
be
decided
in
the
deadliest
manner
,
*NL*
hand
to
hand
,
with
weapons
of
offense
,
and
none
of
defense
.
*NL*
*NL*
Uncas
answered
the
whoop
,
and
leaping
on
an
enemy
,
with
a
single
,
*NL*
well-directed
blow
of
his
tomahawk
,
cleft
him
to
the
brain
.
Heyward
*NL*
tore
the
weapon
of
Magua
from
the
sapling
,
and
rushed
eagerly
toward
*NL*
the
fray
.
As
the
combatants
were
now
equal
in
number
,
each
singled
an
*NL*
opponent
from
the
adverse
band
.
The
rush
and
blows
passed
with
the
fury
*NL*
of
a
whirlwind
,
and
the
swiftness
of
lightning
.
Hawkeye
soon
got
another
*NL*
enemy
within
reach
of
his
arm
,
and
with
one
sweep
of
his
formidable
*NL*
weapon
he
beat
down
the
slight
and
inartificial
defenses
of
his
*NL*
antagonist
,
crushing
him
to
the
earth
with
the
blow
.
Heyward
ventured
*NL*
to
hurl
the
tomahawk
he
had
seized
,
too
ardent
to
await
the
moment
*NL*
of
closing
.
It
struck
the
Indian
he
had
selected
on
the
forehead
,
*NL*
and
checked
for
an
instant
his
onward
rush
.
Encouraged
by
this
slight
*NL*
advantage
,
the
impetuous
young
man
continued
his
onset
,
and
sprang
upon
*NL*
his
enemy
with
naked
hands
.
A
single
instant
was
enough
to
assure
him
*NL*
of
the
rashness
of
the
measure
,
for
he
immediately
found
himself
fully
*NL*
engaged
,
with
all
his
activity
and
courage
,
in
endeavoring
to
ward
the
*NL*
desperate
thrusts
made
with
the
knife
of
the
Huron
.
Unable
longer
to
*NL*
foil
an
enemy
so
alert
and
vigilant
,
he
threw
his
arms
about
him
,
and
*NL*
succeeded
in
pinning
the
limbs
of
the
other
to
his
side
,
with
an
iron
*NL*
grasp
,
but
one
that
was
far
too
exhausting
to
himself
to
continue
long
.
*NL*
In
this
extremity
he
heard
a
voice
near
him
,
shouting
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Extarminate
the
varlets
!
no
quarter
to
an
accursed
Mingo
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
next
moment
,
the
breech
of
Hawkeye
's
rifle
fell
on
the
naked
head
*NL*
of
his
adversary
,
whose
muscles
appeared
to
wither
under
the
shock
,
as
*NL*
he
sank
from
the
arms
of
Duncan
,
flexible
and
motionless
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Uncas
had
brained
his
first
antagonist
,
he
turned
,
like
a
hungry
*NL*
lion
,
to
seek
another
.
The
fifth
and
only
Huron
disengaged
at
the
first
*NL*
onset
had
paused
a
moment
,
and
then
seeing
that
all
around
him
were
*NL*
employed
in
the
deadly
strife
,
he
had
sought
,
with
hellish
vengeance
,
*NL*
to
complete
the
baffled
work
of
revenge
.
Raising
a
shout
of
triumph
,
he
*NL*
sprang
toward
the
defenseless
Cora
,
sending
his
keen
axe
as
the
dreadful
*NL*
precursor
of
his
approach
.
The
tomahawk
grazed
her
shoulder
,
and
cutting
*NL*
the
withes
which
bound
her
to
the
tree
,
left
the
maiden
at
liberty
to
*NL*
fly
.
She
eluded
the
grasp
of
the
savage
,
and
reckless
of
her
own
*NL*
safety
,
threw
herself
on
the
bosom
of
Alice
,
striving
with
convulsed
*NL*
and
ill-directed
fingers
,
to
tear
asunder
the
twigs
which
confined
the
*NL*
person
of
her
sister
.
Any
other
than
a
monster
would
have
relented
at
*NL*
such
an
act
of
generous
devotion
to
the
best
and
purest
affection
;
but
*NL*
the
breast
of
the
Huron
was
a
stranger
to
sympathy
.
Seizing
Cora
by
the
*NL*
rich
tresses
which
fell
in
confusion
about
her
form
,
he
tore
her
from
*NL*
her
frantic
hold
,
and
bowed
her
down
with
brutal
violence
to
her
knees
.
*NL*
The
savage
drew
the
flowing
curls
through
his
hand
,
and
raising
them
*NL*
on
high
with
an
outstretched
arm
,
he
passed
the
knife
around
the
*NL*
exquisitely
molded
head
of
his
victim
,
with
a
taunting
and
exulting
*NL*
laugh
.
But
he
purchased
this
moment
of
fierce
gratification
with
the
*NL*
loss
of
the
fatal
opportunity
.
It
was
just
then
the
sight
caught
the
eye
*NL*
of
Uncas
.
Bounding
from
his
footsteps
he
appeared
for
an
instant
darting
*NL*
through
the
air
and
descending
in
a
ball
he
fell
on
the
chest
of
his
*NL*
enemy
,
driving
him
many
yards
from
the
spot
,
headlong
and
prostrate
.
The
*NL*
violence
of
the
exertion
cast
the
young
Mohican
at
his
side
.
They
arose
*NL*
together
,
fought
,
and
bled
,
each
in
his
turn
.
But
the
conflict
was
soon
*NL*
decided
;
the
tomahawk
of
Heyward
and
the
rifle
of
Hawkeye
descended
*NL*
on
the
skull
of
the
Huron
,
at
the
same
moment
that
the
knife
of
Uncas
*NL*
reached
his
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
battle
was
now
entirely
terminated
with
the
exception
of
the
*NL*
protracted
struggle
between
``
Le
Renard
Subtil
''
and
``
Le
Gros
Serpent
.
''
*NL*
Well
did
these
barbarous
warriors
prove
that
they
deserved
those
*NL*
significant
names
which
had
been
bestowed
for
deeds
in
former
wars
.
*NL*
When
they
engaged
,
some
little
time
was
lost
in
eluding
the
quick
and
*NL*
vigorous
thrusts
which
had
been
aimed
at
their
lives
.
Suddenly
darting
*NL*
on
each
other
,
they
closed
,
and
came
to
the
earth
,
twisted
together
like
*NL*
twining
serpents
,
in
pliant
and
subtle
folds
.
At
the
moment
when
the
*NL*
victors
found
themselves
unoccupied
,
the
spot
where
these
experienced
*NL*
and
desperate
combatants
lay
could
only
be
distinguished
by
a
cloud
of
*NL*
dust
and
leaves
,
which
moved
from
the
center
of
the
little
plain
toward
*NL*
its
boundary
,
as
if
raised
by
the
passage
of
a
whirlwind
.
Urged
by
the
*NL*
different
motives
of
filial
affection
,
friendship
and
gratitude
,
Heyward
*NL*
and
his
companions
rushed
with
one
accord
to
the
place
,
encircling
the
*NL*
little
canopy
of
dust
which
hung
above
the
warriors
.
In
vain
did
Uncas
*NL*
dart
around
the
cloud
,
with
a
wish
to
strike
his
knife
into
the
heart
*NL*
of
his
father
's
foe
;
the
threatening
rifle
of
Hawkeye
was
raised
and
*NL*
suspended
in
vain
,
while
Duncan
endeavored
to
seize
the
limbs
of
the
*NL*
Huron
with
hands
that
appeared
to
have
lost
their
power
.
Covered
as
they
*NL*
were
with
dust
and
blood
,
the
swift
evolutions
of
the
combatants
seemed
*NL*
to
incorporate
their
bodies
into
one
.
The
death-like
looking
figure
of
*NL*
the
Mohican
,
and
the
dark
form
of
the
Huron
,
gleamed
before
their
eyes
*NL*
in
such
quick
and
confused
succession
,
that
the
friends
of
the
former
*NL*
knew
not
where
to
plant
the
succoring
blow
.
It
is
true
there
were
short
*NL*
and
fleeting
moments
,
when
the
fiery
eyes
of
Magua
were
seen
glittering
,
*NL*
like
the
fabled
organs
of
the
basilisk
through
the
dusty
wreath
by
which
*NL*
he
was
enveloped
,
and
he
read
by
those
short
and
deadly
glances
the
fate
*NL*
of
the
combat
in
the
presence
of
his
enemies
;
ere
,
however
,
any
hostile
*NL*
hand
could
descend
on
his
devoted
head
,
its
place
was
filled
by
the
*NL*
scowling
visage
of
Chingachgook
.
In
this
manner
the
scene
of
the
combat
*NL*
was
removed
from
the
center
of
the
little
plain
to
its
verge
.
The
*NL*
Mohican
now
found
an
opportunity
to
make
a
powerful
thrust
with
his
*NL*
knife
;
Magua
suddenly
relinquished
his
grasp
,
and
fell
backward
without
*NL*
motion
,
and
seemingly
without
life
.
His
adversary
leaped
on
his
feet
,
*NL*
making
the
arches
of
the
forest
ring
with
the
sounds
of
triumph
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
done
for
the
Delawares
!
victory
to
the
Mohicans
!
''
cried
Hawkeye
,
*NL*
once
more
elevating
the
butt
of
the
long
and
fatal
rifle
;
``
a
finishing
*NL*
blow
from
a
man
without
a
cross
will
never
tell
against
his
honor
,
nor
*NL*
rob
him
of
his
right
to
the
scalp
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
at
the
very
moment
when
the
dangerous
weapon
was
in
the
act
of
*NL*
descending
,
the
subtle
Huron
rolled
swiftly
from
beneath
the
danger
,
*NL*
over
the
edge
of
the
precipice
,
and
falling
on
his
feet
,
was
seen
*NL*
leaping
,
with
a
single
bound
,
into
the
center
of
a
thicket
of
low
*NL*
bushes
,
which
clung
along
its
sides
.
The
Delawares
,
who
had
believed
*NL*
their
enemy
dead
,
uttered
their
exclamation
of
surprise
,
and
were
*NL*
following
with
speed
and
clamor
,
like
hounds
in
open
view
of
the
deer
,
*NL*
when
a
shrill
and
peculiar
cry
from
the
scout
instantly
changed
their
*NL*
purpose
,
and
recalled
them
to
the
summit
of
the
hill
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
was
like
himself
!
''
cried
the
inveterate
forester
,
whose
prejudices
*NL*
contributed
so
largely
to
veil
his
natural
sense
of
justice
in
all
*NL*
matters
which
concerned
the
Mingoes
;
``
a
lying
and
deceitful
varlet
as
*NL*
he
is
.
An
honest
Delaware
now
,
being
fairly
vanquished
,
would
have
lain
*NL*
still
,
and
been
knocked
on
the
head
,
but
these
knavish
Maquas
cling
to
*NL*
life
like
so
many
cats-o
'
-
the-mountain
.
Let
him
go
--
let
him
go
;
't
is
but
*NL*
one
man
,
and
he
without
rifle
or
bow
,
many
a
long
mile
from
his
French
*NL*
commerades
;
and
like
a
rattler
that
lost
his
fangs
,
he
can
do
no
further
*NL*
mischief
,
until
such
time
as
he
,
and
we
too
,
may
leave
the
prints
of
our
*NL*
moccasins
over
a
long
reach
of
sandy
plain
.
See
,
Uncas
,
''
he
added
,
in
*NL*
Delaware
,
``
your
father
is
flaying
the
scalps
already
.
It
may
be
well
to
*NL*
go
round
and
feel
the
vagabonds
that
are
left
,
or
we
may
have
another
of
*NL*
them
loping
through
the
woods
,
and
screeching
like
a
jay
that
has
been
*NL*
winged
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
saying
the
honest
but
implacable
scout
made
the
circuit
of
the
dead
,
*NL*
into
whose
senseless
bosoms
he
thrust
his
long
knife
,
with
as
much
*NL*
coolness
as
though
they
had
been
so
many
brute
carcasses
.
He
had
,
*NL*
however
,
been
anticipated
by
the
elder
Mohican
,
who
had
already
torn
the
*NL*
emblems
of
victory
from
the
unresisting
heads
of
the
slain
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Uncas
,
denying
his
habits
,
we
had
almost
said
his
nature
,
flew
with
*NL*
instinctive
delicacy
,
accompanied
by
Heyward
,
to
the
assistance
of
the
*NL*
females
,
and
quickly
releasing
Alice
,
placed
her
in
the
arms
of
Cora
.
We
*NL*
shall
not
attempt
to
describe
the
gratitude
to
the
Almighty
Disposer
*NL*
of
Events
which
glowed
in
the
bosoms
of
the
sisters
,
who
were
thus
*NL*
unexpectedly
restored
to
life
and
to
each
other
.
Their
thanksgivings
*NL*
were
deep
and
silent
;
the
offerings
of
their
gentle
spirits
burning
*NL*
brightest
and
purest
on
the
secret
altars
of
their
hearts
;
and
their
*NL*
renovated
and
more
earthly
feelings
exhibiting
themselves
in
long
and
*NL*
fervent
though
speechless
caresses
.
As
Alice
rose
from
her
knees
,
where
*NL*
she
had
sunk
by
the
side
of
Cora
,
she
threw
herself
on
the
bosom
of
the
*NL*
latter
,
and
sobbed
aloud
the
name
of
their
aged
father
,
while
her
soft
,
*NL*
dove-like
eyes
,
sparkled
with
the
rays
of
hope
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
saved
!
we
are
saved
!
''
she
murmured
;
``
to
return
to
the
arms
of
*NL*
our
dear
,
dear
father
,
and
his
heart
will
not
be
broken
with
grief
.
And
*NL*
you
,
too
,
Cora
,
my
sister
,
my
more
than
sister
,
my
mother
;
you
,
too
,
*NL*
are
spared
.
And
Duncan
,
''
she
added
,
looking
round
upon
the
youth
with
a
*NL*
smile
of
ineffable
innocence
,
``
even
our
own
brave
and
noble
Duncan
has
*NL*
escaped
without
a
hurt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
these
ardent
and
nearly
innocent
words
Cora
made
no
other
answer
than
*NL*
by
straining
the
youthful
speaker
to
her
heart
,
as
she
bent
over
her
*NL*
in
melting
tenderness
.
The
manhood
of
Heyward
felt
no
shame
in
dropping
*NL*
tears
over
this
spectacle
of
affectionate
rapture
;
and
Uncas
stood
,
*NL*
fresh
and
blood-stained
from
the
combat
,
a
calm
,
and
,
apparently
,
an
*NL*
unmoved
looker-on
,
it
is
true
,
but
with
eyes
that
had
already
lost
their
*NL*
fierceness
,
and
were
beaming
with
a
sympathy
that
elevated
him
far
*NL*
above
the
intelligence
,
and
advanced
him
probably
centuries
before
,
the
*NL*
practises
of
his
nation
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
this
display
of
emotions
so
natural
in
their
situation
,
Hawkeye
,
*NL*
whose
vigilant
distrust
had
satisfied
itself
that
the
Hurons
,
who
*NL*
disfigured
the
heavenly
scene
,
no
longer
possessed
the
power
to
*NL*
interrupt
its
harmony
,
approached
David
,
and
liberated
him
from
the
*NL*
bonds
he
had
,
until
that
moment
,
endured
with
the
most
exemplary
*NL*
patience
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
''
exclaimed
the
scout
,
casting
the
last
withe
behind
him
,
``
you
*NL*
are
once
more
master
of
your
own
limbs
,
though
you
seem
not
to
use
them
*NL*
with
much
greater
judgment
than
that
in
which
they
were
first
fashioned
.
*NL*
If
advice
from
one
who
is
not
older
than
yourself
,
but
who
,
having
*NL*
lived
most
of
his
time
in
the
wilderness
,
may
be
said
to
have
experience
*NL*
beyond
his
years
,
will
give
no
offense
,
you
are
welcome
to
my
thoughts
;
*NL*
and
these
are
,
to
part
with
the
little
tooting
instrument
in
your
jacket
*NL*
to
the
first
fool
you
meet
with
,
and
buy
some
we
`
pon
with
the
money
,
if
*NL*
it
be
only
the
barrel
of
a
horseman
's
pistol
.
By
industry
and
care
,
you
*NL*
might
thus
come
to
some
prefarment
;
for
by
this
time
,
I
should
think
,
*NL*
your
eyes
would
plainly
tell
you
that
a
carrion
crow
is
a
better
bird
*NL*
than
a
mocking-thresher
.
The
one
will
,
at
least
,
remove
foul
sights
*NL*
from
before
the
face
of
man
,
while
the
other
is
only
good
to
brew
*NL*
disturbances
in
the
woods
,
by
cheating
the
ears
of
all
that
hear
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Arms
and
the
clarion
for
the
battle
,
but
the
song
of
thanksgiving
*NL*
to
the
victory
!
''
answered
the
liberated
David
.
``
Friend
,
''
he
added
,
*NL*
thrusting
forth
his
lean
,
delicate
hand
toward
Hawkeye
,
in
kindness
,
*NL*
while
his
eyes
twinkled
and
grew
moist
,
``
I
thank
thee
that
the
hairs
*NL*
of
my
head
still
grow
where
they
were
first
rooted
by
Providence
;
for
,
*NL*
though
those
of
other
men
may
be
more
glossy
and
curling
,
I
have
ever
*NL*
found
mine
own
well
suited
to
the
brain
they
shelter
.
That
I
did
not
*NL*
join
myself
to
the
battle
,
was
less
owing
to
disinclination
,
than
to
the
*NL*
bonds
of
the
heathen
.
Valiant
and
skillful
hast
thou
proved
thyself
in
*NL*
the
conflict
,
and
I
hereby
thank
thee
,
before
proceeding
to
discharge
*NL*
other
and
more
important
duties
,
because
thou
hast
proved
thyself
well
*NL*
worthy
of
a
Christian
's
praise

*NL*
*NL*
``
The
thing
is
but
a
trifle
,
and
what
you
may
often
see
if
you
tarry
long
*NL*
among
us
,

returned
the
scout
,
a
good
deal
softened
toward
the
man
of
*NL*
song
,
by
this
unequivocal
expression
of
gratitude
.
``
I
have
got
back
my
*NL*
old
companion
,
`
killdeer

''
he
added
,
striking
his
hand
on
the
breech
of
*NL*
his
rifle
;
``
and
that
in
itself
is
a
victory

These
Iroquois
are
cunning
,
*NL*
but
they
outwitted
themselves
when
they
placed
their
firearms
out
of
*NL*
reach
;
and
had
Uncas
or
his
father
been
gifted
with
only
their
common
*NL*
Indian
patience
,
we
should
have
come
in
upon
the
knaves
with
three
*NL*
bullets
instead
of
one
,
and
that
would
have
made
a
finish
of
the
whole
*NL*
pack
;
yon
loping
varlet

as
well
as
his
commerades

was
all

fore-ordered
,

for
the
best

*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou

well

returned
David
,
``

hast
caught
the
true

This

the
doctrine

consoling

refreshing
it
is

*NL*
The
scout
,
who
by
this
time
was
seated
,
examining
into
the
state
of
his
*NL*
rifle
with
a
species
of
parental
assiduity
,
now
looked
up
at
the
other
*NL*
in
a
displeasure
that
he
did
not
affect
to
conceal
,
roughly
interrupting
*NL*
further
speech

*NL*
*NL*
``
Doctrine

no

said
the
sturdy
woodsman
,

the

curse

can
credit

yonder
Huron

was
to
fall
by

hand

my
own
eyes
I
have
seen
it

nothing
*NL*
short
of
being
a
witness

cause
me
to
think
he
has
met
with
any
*NL*
reward

that
Chingachgook
there
will
be
condemned
at
the
final
day

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
no
warranty
for
such
an
audacious
doctrine

nor
any
covenant
*NL*
to
support
it

cried
David
who
was
deeply
tinctured
with
the
subtle
*NL*
distinctions
which
,
in
his
time
,
and
more
especially
in
his
province
,
*NL*
had
been
drawn
around
the
beautiful
simplicity
of
revelation
,
by
*NL*
endeavoring
to
penetrate
the
awful
mystery
of
the
divine
nature
,
*NL*
supplying
faith
by
self-sufficiency
,
and
by
consequence
,
involving
those
*NL*
who
reasoned
from
such
human
dogmas
in
absurdities
and
doubt
;
``
your
*NL*
temple
is
reared
on
the
sands

the
first
tempest

wash
away
its

I
demand
your
authorities
for
such
an
uncharitable
assertion
*NL*
-LRB-
like
other
advocates

David

accurate

``

repeated
Hawkeye
,
with
singular
and
ill-concealed
disdain
;

*NL*
``

David

misconceiving
the
other

meaning

''
'T

open
before

returned
the
scout
;
``

he

owns

from
sun
to
sun
,
through
the
*NL*
windings
of
the
forest
,
he
shall
see
enough
to
teach
him
that
he
is
a
*NL*
fool
,
and
that
the
greatest
of
his
folly
lies
in
striving
to
rise
to
the
*NL*
level
of
One
he
can
never
equal
,
be
it
in
goodness
,
or
be
it
in
power
.

*NL*
*NL*
The
instant
David
discovered
that
he
battled
with
a
disputant
who
*NL*
imbibed
his
faith
from
the
lights
of
nature
,
eschewing
all
subtleties
*NL*
of
doctrine
,
he
willingly
abandoned
a
controversy
from
which
he
believed
*NL*
neither
profit
nor
credit
was
to
be
derived
.
While
the
scout
was
*NL*
speaking
,
he
had
also
seated
himself
,
and
producing
the
ready
little
*NL*
volume
and
the
iron-rimmed
spectacles
,
he
prepared
to
discharge
a
*NL*
duty
,
which
nothing
but
the
unexpected
assault
he
had
received
in
his
*NL*
orthodoxy
could
have
so
long
suspended
.
He
was
,
in
truth
,
a
minstrel
of
*NL*
the
western
continent
--
of
a
much
later
day
,
certainly
,
than
those
gifted
*NL*
bards
,
who
formerly
sang
the
profane
renown
of
baron
and
prince
,
but
*NL*
after
the
spirit
of
his
own
age
and
country
;
and
he
was
now
prepared
*NL*
to
exercise
the
cunning
of
his
craft
,
in
celebration
of
,
or
rather
in
*NL*
thanksgiving
for
,
the
recent
victory
.
He
waited
patiently
for
Hawkeye
to
*NL*
cease
,
then
lifting
his
eyes
,
together
with
his
voice
,
he
said
,
aloud
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
invite
you
,
friends
,
to
join
in
praise
for
this
signal
deliverance
*NL*
from
the
hands
of
barbarians
and
infidels
,
to
the
comfortable
and
solemn
*NL*
tones
of
the
tune
called
`
Northampton
'
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
next
named
the
page
and
verse
where
the
rhymes
selected
were
to
be
*NL*
found
,
and
applied
the
pitch-pipe
to
his
lips
,
with
the
decent
gravity
*NL*
that
he
had
been
wont
to
use
in
the
temple
.
This
time
he
was
,
however
,
*NL*
without
any
accompaniment
,
for
the
sisters
were
just
then
pouring
out
*NL*
those
tender
effusions
of
affection
which
have
been
already
alluded
*NL*
to
.
Nothing
deterred
by
the
smallness
of
his
audience
,
which
,
in
*NL*
truth
,
consisted
only
of
the
discontented
scout
,
he
raised
his
voice
,
*NL*
commencing
and
ending
the
sacred
song
without
accident
or
interruption
*NL*
of
any
kind
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hawkeye
listened
while
he
coolly
adjusted
his
flint
and
reloaded
his
*NL*
rifle
;
but
the
sounds
,
wanting
the
extraneous
assistance
of
scene
and
*NL*
sympathy
,
failed
to
awaken
his
slumbering
emotions
.
Never
minstrel
,
*NL*
or
by
whatever
more
suitable
name
David
should
be
known
,
drew
upon
his
*NL*
talents
in
the
presence
of
more
insensible
auditors
;
though
considering
*NL*
the
singleness
and
sincerity
of
his
motive
,
it
is
probable
that
no
bard
*NL*
of
profane
song
ever
uttered
notes
that
ascended
so
near
to
that
throne
*NL*
where
all
homage
and
praise
is
due
.
The
scout
shook
his
head
,
and
*NL*
muttering
some
unintelligible
words
,
among
which
``
throat
''
and
``
Iroquois
''
*NL*
were
alone
audible
,
he
walked
away
,
to
collect
and
to
examine
into
the
*NL*
state
of
the
captured
arsenal
of
the
Hurons
.
In
this
office
he
was
now
*NL*
joined
by
Chingachgook
,
who
found
his
own
,
as
well
as
the
rifle
of
his
*NL*
son
,
among
the
arms
.
Even
Heyward
and
David
were
furnished
with
weapons
;
*NL*
nor
was
ammunition
wanting
to
render
them
all
effectual
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
foresters
had
made
their
selection
,
and
distributed
their
*NL*
prizes
,
the
scout
announced
that
the
hour
had
arrived
when
it
was
*NL*
necessary
to
move
.
By
this
time
the
song
of
Gamut
had
ceased
,
and
the
*NL*
sisters
had
learned
to
still
the
exhibition
of
their
emotions
.
Aided
by
*NL*
Duncan
and
the
younger
Mohican
,
the
two
latter
descended
the
precipitous
*NL*
sides
of
that
hill
which
they
had
so
lately
ascended
under
so
very
*NL*
different
auspices
,
and
whose
summit
had
so
nearly
proved
the
scene
of
*NL*
their
massacre
.
At
the
foot
they
found
the
Narragansetts
browsing
the
*NL*
herbage
of
the
bushes
,
and
having
mounted
,
they
followed
the
movements
*NL*
of
a
guide
,
who
,
in
the
most
deadly
straits
,
had
so
often
proved
himself
*NL*
their
friend
.
The
journey
was
,
however
,
short
.
Hawkeye
,
leaving
the
*NL*
blind
path
that
the
Hurons
had
followed
,
turned
short
to
his
right
,
*NL*
and
entering
the
thicket
,
he
crossed
a
babbling
brook
,
and
halted
in
a
*NL*
narrow
dell
,
under
the
shade
of
a
few
water
elms
.
Their
distance
from
*NL*
the
base
of
the
fatal
hill
was
but
a
few
rods
,
and
the
steeds
had
been
*NL*
serviceable
only
in
crossing
the
shallow
stream
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
scout
and
the
Indians
appeared
to
be
familiar
with
the
sequestered
*NL*
place
where
they
now
were
;
for
,
leaning
their
rifle
against
the
trees
,
*NL*
they
commenced
throwing
aside
the
dried
leaves
,
and
opening
the
blue
*NL*
clay
,
out
of
which
a
clear
and
sparkling
spring
of
bright
,
glancing
*NL*
water
,
quickly
bubbled
.
The
white
man
then
looked
about
him
,
as
though
*NL*
seeking
for
some
object
,
which
was
not
to
be
found
as
readily
as
he
*NL*
expected
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Them
careless
imps
,
the
Mohawks
,
with
their
Tuscarora
and
Onondaga
*NL*
brethren
,
have
been
here
slaking
their
thirst
,
''
he
muttered
,
``
and
the
*NL*
vagabonds
have
thrown
away
the
gourd
!
This
is
the
way
with
benefits
,
*NL*
when
they
are
bestowed
on
such
disremembering
hounds
!
Here
has
the
Lord
*NL*
laid
his
hand
,
in
the
midst
of
the
howling
wilderness
,
for
their
good
,
*NL*
and
raised
a
fountain
of
water
from
the
bowels
of
the
`
arth
,
that
might
*NL*
laugh
at
the
richest
shop
of
apothecary
's
ware
in
all
the
colonies
;
and
*NL*
see
!
the
knaves
have
trodden
in
the
clay
,
and
deformed
the
cleanliness
*NL*
of
the
place
,
as
though
they
were
brute
beasts
,
instead
of
human
men
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Uncas
silently
extended
toward
him
the
desired
gourd
,
which
the
spleen
*NL*
of
Hawkeye
had
hitherto
prevented
him
from
observing
on
a
branch
of
*NL*
an
elm
.
Filling
it
with
water
,
he
retired
a
short
distance
,
to
a
place
*NL*
where
the
ground
was
more
firm
and
dry
;
here
he
coolly
seated
himself
,
*NL*
and
after
taking
a
long
,
and
,
apparently
,
a
grateful
draught
,
he
*NL*
commenced
a
very
strict
examination
of
the
fragments
of
food
left
by
the
*NL*
Hurons
,
which
had
hung
in
a
wallet
on
his
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
lad
!
''
he
continued
,
returning
the
empty
gourd
to
Uncas
;
*NL*
``
now
we
will
see
how
these
rampaging
Hurons
lived
,
when
outlying
in
*NL*
ambushments
.
Look
at
this
!
The
varlets
know
the
better
pieces
of
the
*NL*
deer
;
and
one
would
think
they
might
carve
and
roast
a
saddle
,
equal
to
*NL*
the
best
cook
in
the
land
!
But
everything
is
raw
,
for
the
Iroquois
are
*NL*
thorough
savages
.
Uncas
,
take
my
steel
and
kindle
a
fire
;
a
mouthful
of
*NL*
a
tender
broil
will
give
natur
'
a
helping
hand
,
after
so
long
a
trail
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Heyward
,
perceiving
that
their
guides
now
set
about
their
repast
in
*NL*
sober
earnest
,
assisted
the
ladies
to
alight
,
and
placed
himself
at
*NL*
their
side
,
not
unwilling
to
enjoy
a
few
moments
of
grateful
rest
,
after
*NL*
the
bloody
scene
he
had
just
gone
through
.
While
the
culinary
process
*NL*
was
in
hand
,
curiosity
induced
him
to
inquire
into
the
circumstances
*NL*
which
had
led
to
their
timely
and
unexpected
rescue
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
is
it
that
we
see
you
so
soon
,
my
generous
friend
,
''
he
asked
,
``
and
*NL*
without
aid
from
the
garrison
of
Edward
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Had
we
gone
to
the
bend
in
the
river
,
we
might
have
been
in
time
*NL*
to
rake
the
leaves
over
your
bodies
,
but
too
late
to
have
saved
your
*NL*
scalps
,
''
coolly
answered
the
scout
.
``
No
,
no
;
instead
of
throwing
away
*NL*
strength
and
opportunity
by
crossing
to
the
fort
,
we
lay
by
,
under
the
*NL*
bank
of
the
Hudson
,
waiting
to
watch
the
movements
of
the
Hurons
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
were
,
then
,
witnesses
of
all
that
passed
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
of
all
;
for
Indian
sight
is
too
keen
to
be
easily
cheated
,
and
we
*NL*
kept
close
.
A
difficult
matter
it
was
,
too
,
to
keep
this
Mohican
boy
*NL*
snug
in
the
ambushment
.
Ah
!
Uncas
,
Uncas
,
your
behavior
was
more
like
*NL*
that
of
a
curious
woman
than
of
a
warrior
on
his
scent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Uncas
permitted
his
eyes
to
turn
for
an
instant
on
the
sturdy
*NL*
countenance
of
the
speaker
,
but
he
neither
spoke
nor
gave
any
indication
*NL*
of
repentance
.
On
the
contrary
,
Heyward
thought
the
manner
of
the
young
*NL*
Mohican
was
disdainful
,
if
not
a
little
fierce
,
and
that
he
suppressed
*NL*
passions
that
were
ready
to
explode
,
as
much
in
compliment
to
the
*NL*
listeners
,
as
from
the
deference
he
usually
paid
to
his
white
associate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
saw
our
capture
?
''
Heyward
next
demanded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
heard
it
,
''
was
the
significant
answer
.
``
An
Indian
yell
is
plain
*NL*
language
to
men
who
have
passed
their
days
in
the
woods
.
But
when
you
*NL*
landed
,
we
were
driven
to
crawl
like
sarpents
,
beneath
the
leaves
;
and
*NL*
then
we
lost
sight
of
you
entirely
,
until
we
placed
eyes
on
you
again
*NL*
trussed
to
the
trees
,
and
ready
bound
for
an
Indian
massacre
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Our
rescue
was
the
deed
of
Providence
.
It
was
nearly
a
miracle
that
you
*NL*
did
not
mistake
the
path
,
for
the
Hurons
divided
,
and
each
band
had
its
*NL*
horses
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
!
there
we
were
thrown
off
the
scent
,
and
might
,
indeed
,
have
lost
*NL*
the
trail

had
it
not
been
for
Uncas
;
we
took
the
path
,
however
,
that
*NL*
led
into
the
wilderness
;
for
we
judged
,
and
judged
rightly
,
that
the
*NL*
savages
would
hold
that
course
with
their
prisoners
.
But
when
we
had
*NL*
followed
it
for
many
miles
,
without
finding
a
single
twig
broken
,
as
I
*NL*
had
advised
,
my
mind
misgave
me
;
especially
as
all
the
footsteps
had
the
*NL*
prints
of
moccasins

*NL*
*NL*
``
Our
captors
had
the
precaution
to
see
us
shod
like
themselves

said
*NL*
Duncan
,
raising
a
foot
,
and
exhibiting
the
buckskin
he
wore
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye

was
judgmatical

so
common
an

*NL*
``
To
what

To

as
a
white
man

has
no

I
should
be

ashamed

own
;
to
the
judgment
of
the
young
Mohican
,
in
matters
which
*NL*
I
should
know
better
than
he
,
but
which
I
can
now
hardly
believe
to
be
*NL*
true
,
though
my
own
eyes
tell
me
it
is
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
extraordinary
!
will
you
not
name
the
reason
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Uncas
was
bold
enough
to
say
,
that
the
beasts
ridden
by
the
gentle
*NL*
ones

continued
Hawkeye
,
glancing
his
eyes
,
not
without
curious
*NL*
interest
,
on
the
fillies
of
the
ladies
,
``
planted
the
legs
of
one
side
on
*NL*
the
ground
at
the
same
time
,
which
is
contrary
to
the
movements
of
all
*NL*
trotting
four-footed
animals
of
my
knowledge
,
except
the
bear
.
And
yet
*NL*
here
are
horses
that
always
journey
in
this
manner
,
as
my
own
eyes
have
*NL*
seen
,
and
as
their
trail
has
shown
for
twenty
long
miles
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
the
merit
of
the
animal
!
They
come
from
the
shores
of
*NL*
Narrangansett
Bay
,
in
the
small
province
of
Providence
Plantations
,
*NL*
and
are
celebrated
for
their
hardihood
,
and
the
ease
of
this
peculiar
*NL*
movement
;
though
other
horses
are
not
unfrequently
trained
to
the
same
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
may
be
--
it
may
be
,
''
said
Hawkeye
,
who
had
listened
with
singular
*NL*
attention
to
this
explanation
;
``
though
I
am
a
man
who
has
the
full
blood
*NL*
of
the
whites
,
my
judgment
in
deer
and
beaver
is
greater
than
in
beasts
*NL*
of
burden
.
Major
Effingham
has
many
noble
chargers
,
but
I
have
never
*NL*
seen
one
travel
after
such
a
sidling
gait
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
True
;
for
he
would
value
the
animals
for
very
different
properties
.
*NL*
Still
is
this
a
breed
highly
esteemed
and
,
as
you
witness
,
much
honored
*NL*
with
the
burdens
it
is
often
destined
to
bear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Mohicans
had
suspended
their
operations
about
the
glimmering
fire
*NL*
to
listen
;
and
,
when
Duncan
had
done
,
they
looked
at
each
other
*NL*
significantly
,
the
father
uttering
the
never-failing
exclamation
of
*NL*
surprise
.
The
scout
ruminated
,
like
a
man
digesting
his
newly-acquired
*NL*
knowledge
,
and
once
more
stole
a
glance
at
the
horses
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
dare
to
say
there
are
even
stranger
sights
to
be
seen
in
the
*NL*
settlements
!
''
he
said
,
at
length
.
``
Natur
'
is
sadly
abused
by
man
,
when
*NL*
he
once
gets
the
mastery
.
But
,
go
sidling
or
go
straight
,
Uncas
had
seen
*NL*
the
movement
,
and
their
trail
led
us
on
to
the
broken
bush
.
The
outer
*NL*
branch
,
near
the
prints
of
one
of
the
horses
,
was
bent
upward
,
as
a
lady
*NL*
breaks
a
flower
from
its
stem
,
but
all
the
rest
were
ragged
and
broken
*NL*
down
,
as
if
the
strong
hand
of
a
man
had
been
tearing
them
!
So
I
*NL*
concluded
that
the
cunning
varments
had
seen
the
twig
bent
,
and
had
torn
*NL*
the
rest
,
to
make
us
believe
a
buck
had
been
feeling
the
boughs
with
his
*NL*
antlers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
believe
your
sagacity
did
not
deceive
you
;
for
some
such
thing
*NL*
occurred
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
was
easy
to
see
,
''
added
the
scout
,
in
no
degree
conscious
of
*NL*
having
exhibited
any
extraordinary
sagacity
;
``
and
a
very
different
*NL*
matter
it
was
from
a
waddling
horse
!
It
then
struck
me
the
Mingoes
*NL*
would
push
for
this
spring
,
for
the
knaves
well
know
the
vartue
of
its
*NL*
waters
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
,
then
,
so
famous
?
''
demanded
Heyward
,
examining
,
with
a
more
*NL*
curious
eye
,
the
secluded
dell
,
with
its
bubbling
fountain
,
surrounded
,
*NL*
as
it
was
,
by
earth
of
a
deep
,
dingy
brown
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Few
red-skins
,
who
travel
south
and
east
of
the
great
lakes
but
have
*NL*
heard
of
its
qualities
.
Will
you
taste
for
yourself
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Heyward
took
the
gourd
,
and
after
swallowing
a
little
of
the
water
,
*NL*
threw
it
aside
with
grimaces
of
discontent
.
The
scout
laughed
in
his
*NL*
silent
but
heartfelt
manner
,
and
shook
his
head
with
vast
satisfaction
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
you
want
the
flavor
that
one
gets
by
habit
;
the
time
was
when
I
*NL*
liked
it
as
little
as
yourself
;
but
I
have
come
to
my
taste
,
and
I
now
*NL*
crave
it
,
as
a
deer
does
the
licks
*
.
Your
high-spiced
wines
are
not
*NL*
better
liked
than
a
red-skin
relishes
this
water
;
especially
when
his
*NL*
natur
'
is
ailing
.
But
Uncas
has
made
his
fire
,
and
it
is
time
we
think
*NL*
of
eating
,
for
our
journey
is
long
,
and
all
before
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*
Many
of
the
animals
of
the
American
forests
resort
to
*NL*
those
spots
where
salt
springs
are
found
.
These
are
called
*NL*
``
licks
''
or
``
salt
licks
,
''
in
the
language
of
the
country
,
*NL*
from
the
circumstance
that
the
quadruped
is
often
obliged
to
*NL*
lick
the
earth
,
in
order
to
obtain
the
saline
particles
.
*NL*
These
licks
are
great
places
of
resort
with
the
hunters
,
who
*NL*
waylay
their
game
near
the
paths
that
lead
to
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Interrupting
the
dialogue
by
this
abrupt
transition
,
the
scout
had
*NL*
instant
recourse
to
the
fragments
of
food
which
had
escaped
the
voracity
*NL*
of
the
Hurons
.
A
very
summary
process
completed
the
simple
cookery
,
when
*NL*
he
and
the
Mohicans
commenced
their
humble
meal
,
with
the
silence
and
*NL*
characteristic
diligence
of
men
who
ate
in
order
to
enable
themselves
to
*NL*
endure
great
and
unremitting
toil
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
this
necessary
,
and
,
happily
,
grateful
duty
had
been
performed
,
*NL*
each
of
the
foresters
stooped
and
took
a
long
and
parting
draught
at
*NL*
that
solitary
and
silent
spring
*
,
around
which
and
its
sister
fountains
,
*NL*
within
fifty
years
,
the
wealth
,
beauty
and
talents
of
a
hemisphere
were
*NL*
to
assemble
in
throngs
,
in
pursuit
of
health
and
pleasure
.
Then
Hawkeye
*NL*
announced
his
determination
to
proceed
.
The
sisters
resumed
their
*NL*
saddles
;
Duncan
and
David
grapsed
their
rifles
,
and
followed
on
*NL*
footsteps
;
the
scout
leading
the
advance
,
and
the
Mohicans
bringing
up
*NL*
the
rear
.
The
whole
party
moved
swiftly
through
the
narrow
path
,
toward
*NL*
the
north
,
leaving
the
healing
waters
to
mingle
unheeded
with
the
*NL*
adjacent
brooks
and
the
bodies
of
the
dead
to
fester
on
the
neighboring
*NL*
mount
,
without
the
rites
of
sepulture
;
a
fate
but
too
common
to
the
*NL*
warriors
of
the
woods
to
excite
either
commiseration
or
comment
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
The
scene
of
the
foregoing
incidents
is
on
the
spot
where
*NL*
the
village
of
Ballston
now
stands
;
one
of
the
two
principal
*NL*
watering
places
of
America
.

CHAPTER
13
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
seek
a
readier
path
.
''
*NL*
--
Parnell
*NL*
*NL*
The
route
taken
by
Hawkeye
lay
across
those
sandy
plains
,
relived
by
*NL*
occasional
valleys
and
swells
of
land
,
which
had
been
traversed
by
their
*NL*
party
on
the
morning
of
the
same
day
,
with
the
baffled
Magua
for
their
*NL*
guide
.
The
sun
had
now
fallen
low
toward
the
distant
mountains
;
and
*NL*
as
their
journey
lay
through
the
interminable
forest
,
the
heat
was
no
*NL*
longer
oppressive
.
Their
progress
,
in
consequence
,
was
proportionate
;
*NL*
and
long
before
the
twilight
gathered
about
them
,
they
had
made
good
*NL*
many
toilsome
miles
on
their
return
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
hunter
,
like
the
savage
whose
place
he
filled
,
seemed
to
select
*NL*
among
the
blind
signs
of
their
wild
route
,
with
a
species
of
instinct
,
*NL*
seldom
abating
his
speed
,
and
never
pausing
to
deliberate
.
A
rapid
and
*NL*
oblique
glance
at
the
moss
on
the
trees
,
with
an
occasional
upward
gaze
*NL*
toward
the
setting
sun
,
or
a
steady
but
passing
look
at
the
direction
of
*NL*
the
numerous
water
courses
,
through
which
he
waded
,
were
sufficient
*NL*
to
determine
his
path
,
and
remove
his
greatest
difficulties
.
In
the
*NL*
meantime
,
the
forest
began
to
change
its
hues
,
losing
that
lively
green
*NL*
which
had
embellished
its
arches
,
in
the
graver
light
which
is
the
usual
*NL*
precursor
of
the
close
of
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
the
eyes
of
the
sisters
were
endeavoring
to
catch
glimpses
through
*NL*
the
trees
,
of
the
flood
of
golden
glory
which
formed
a
glittering
halo
*NL*
around
the
sun
,
tinging
here
and
there
with
ruby
streaks
,
or
bordering
*NL*
with
narrow
edgings
of
shining
yellow
,
a
mass
of
clouds
that
lay
piled
*NL*
at
no
great
distance
above
the
western
hills
,
Hawkeye
turned
suddenly
*NL*
and
pointing
upward
toward
the
gorgeous
heavens
,
he
spoke
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yonder
is
the
signal
given
to
man
to
seek
his
food
and
natural
rest
,
''
*NL*
he
said
;
``
better
and
wiser
would
it
be
,
if
he
could
understand
the
signs
*NL*
of
nature
,
and
take
a
lesson
from
the
fowls
of
the
air
and
the
beasts
of
*NL*
the
field
!
Our
night
,
however
,
will
soon
be
over
,
for
with
the
moon
*NL*
we
must
be
up
and
moving
again
.
I
remember
to
have
fou
'
t
the
Maquas
,
*NL*
hereaways
,
in
the
first
war
in
which
I
ever
drew
blood
from
man
;
and
we
*NL*
threw
up
a
work
of
blocks
,
to
keep
the
ravenous
varmints
from
handling
*NL*
our
scalps
.
If
my
marks
do
not
fail
me
,
we
shall
find
the
place
a
few
*NL*
rods
further
to
our
left
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Without
waiting
for
an
assent
,
or
,
indeed
,
for
any
reply
,
the
sturdy
*NL*
hunter
moved
boldly
into
a
dense
thicket
of
young
chestnuts
,
shoving
*NL*
aside
the
branches
of
the
exuberant
shoots
which
nearly
covered
the
*NL*
ground
,
like
a
man
who
expected
,
at
each
step
,
to
discover
some
object
*NL*
he
had
formerly
known
.
The
recollection
of
the
scout
did
not
deceive
*NL*
him
.
After
penetrating
through
the
brush
,
matted
as
it
was
with
briars
,
*NL*
for
a
few
hundred
feet
,
he
entered
an
open
space
,
that
surrounded
a
low
,
*NL*
green
hillock
,
which
was
crowned
by
the
decayed
blockhouse
in
question
.
*NL*
This
rude
and
neglected
building
was
one
of
those
deserted
works
,
which
,
*NL*
having
been
thrown
up
on
an
emergency
,
had
been
abandoned
with
the
*NL*
disappearance
of
danger
,
and
was
now
quietly
crumbling
in
the
solitude
*NL*
of
the
forest
,
neglected
and
nearly
forgotten
,
like
the
circumstances
*NL*
which
had
caused
it
to
be
reared
.
Such
memorials
of
the
passage
and
*NL*
struggles
of
man
are
yet
frequent
throughout
the
broad
barrier
of
*NL*
wilderness
which
once
separated
the
hostile
provinces
,
and
form
a
*NL*
species
of
ruins
that
are
intimately
associated
with
the
recollections
*NL*
of
colonial
history
,
and
which
are
in
appropriate
keeping
with
the
*NL*
gloomy
character
of
the
surrounding
scenery
.
The
roof
of
bark
had
long
*NL*
since
fallen
,
and
mingled
with
the
soil
,
but
the
huge
logs
of
pine
,
*NL*
which
had
been
hastily
thrown
together
,
still
preserved
their
relative
*NL*
positions
,
though
one
angle
of
the
work
had
given
way
under
the
*NL*
pressure
,
and
threatened
a
speedy
downfall
to
the
remainder
of
the
*NL*
rustic
edifice
.
While
Heyward
and
his
companions
hesitated
to
approach
*NL*
a
building
so
decayed
,
Hawkeye
and
the
Indians
entered
within
the
low
*NL*
walls
,
not
only
without
fear
,
but
with
obvious
interest
.
While
the
*NL*
former
surveyed
the
ruins
,
both
internally
and
externally
,
with
the
*NL*
curiosity
of
one
whose
recollections
were
reviving
at
each
moment
,
*NL*
Chingachgook
related
to
his
son
,
in
the
language
of
the
Delawares
,
and
*NL*
with
the
pride
of
a
conqueror
,
the
brief
history
of
the
skirmish
which
*NL*
had
been
fought
,
in
his
youth
,
in
that
secluded
spot
.
A
strain
of
*NL*
melancholy
,
however
,
blended
with
his
triumph
,
rendering
his
voice
,
as
*NL*
usual
,
soft
and
musical
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
,
the
sisters
gladly
dismounted
,
and
prepared
to
enjoy
*NL*
their
halt
in
the
coolness
of
the
evening
,
and
in
a
security
which
they
*NL*
believed
nothing
but
the
beasts
of
the
forest
could
invade
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
not
our
resting-place
have
been
more
retired
,
my
worthy
friend
,
''
*NL*
demanded
the
more
vigilant
Duncan
,
perceiving
that
the
scout
had
already
*NL*
finished
his
short
survey
,
``
had
we
chosen
a
spot
less
known
,
and
one
*NL*
more
rarely
visited
than
this
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Few
live
who
know
the
blockhouse
was
ever
raised
,
''
was
the
slow
and
*NL*
musing
answer
;
''
't
is
not
often
that
books
are
made
,
and
narratives
*NL*
written
of
such
a
scrimmage
as
was
here
fou
'
t
atween
the
Mohicans
and
*NL*
the
Mohawks
,
in
a
war
of
their
own
waging
.
I
was
then
a
younker
,
and
*NL*
went
out
with
the
Delawares
,
because
I
know
'd
they
were
a
scandalized
*NL*
and
wronged
race
.
Forty
days
and
forty
nights
did
the
imps
crave
our
*NL*
blood
around
this
pile
of
logs
,
which
I
designed
and
partly
reared
,
*NL*
being
,
as
you
'll
remember
,
no
Indian
myself
,
but
a
man
without
a
cross
.
*NL*
The
Delawares
lent
themselves
to
the
work
,
and
we
made
it
good
,
ten
to
*NL*
twenty
,
until
our
numbers
were
nearly
equal
,
and
then
we
sallied
out
*NL*
upon
the
hounds
,
and
not
a
man
of
them
ever
got
back
to
tell
the
fate
*NL*
of
his
party
.
Yes
,
yes
;
I
was
then
young
,
and
new
to
the
sight
of
blood
;
*NL*
and
not
relishing
the
thought
that
creatures
who
had
spirits
like
myself
*NL*
should
lay
on
the
naked
ground
,
to
be
torn
asunder
by
beasts
,
or
to
*NL*
bleach
in
the
rains
,
I
buried
the
dead
with
my
own
hands
,
under
that
*NL*
very
little
hillock
where
you
have
placed
yourselves
;
and
no
bad
seat
*NL*
does
it
make
neither
,
though
it
be
raised
by
the
bones
of
mortal
men
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Heyward
and
the
sisters
arose
,
on
the
instant
,
from
the
grassy
*NL*
sepulcher
;
nor
could
the
two
latter
,
notwithstanding
the
terrific
scenes
*NL*
they
had
so
recently
passed
through
,
entirely
suppress
an
emotion
of
*NL*
natural
horror
,
when
they
found
themselves
in
such
familiar
contact
with
*NL*
the
grave
of
the
dead
Mohawks
.
The
gray
light
,
the
gloomy
little
area
*NL*
of
dark
grass
,
surrounded
by
its
border
of
brush
,
beyond
which
the
pines
*NL*
rose
,
in
breathing
silence
,
apparently
into
the
very
clouds
,
and
the
*NL*
deathlike
stillness
of
the
vast
forest
,
were
all
in
unison
to
deepen
*NL*
such
a
sensation
.
``
They
are
gone
,
and
they
are
harmless
,
''
continued
*NL*
Hawkeye
,
waving
his
hand
,
with
a
melancholy
smile
at
their
manifest
*NL*
alarm
;
``
they
'll
never
shout
the
war-whoop
nor
strike
a
blow
with
the
*NL*
tomahawk
again
!
And
of
all
those
who
aided
in
placing
them
where
they
*NL*
lie
,
Chingachgook
and
I
only
are
living
!
The
brothers
and
family
of
the
*NL*
Mohican
formed
our
war
party
;
and
you
see
before
you
all
that
are
now
*NL*
left
of
his
race
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
eyes
of
the
listeners
involuntarily
sought
the
forms
of
the
Indians
,
*NL*
with
a
compassionate
interest
in
their
desolate
fortune
.
Their
dark
*NL*
persons
were
still
to
be
seen
within
the
shadows
of
the
blockhouse
,
*NL*
the
son
listening
to
the
relation
of
his
father
with
that
sort
of
*NL*
intenseness
which
would
be
created
by
a
narrative
that
redounded
so
much
*NL*
to
the
honor
of
those
whose
names
he
had
long
revered
for
their
courage
*NL*
and
savage
virtues
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
thought
the
Delawares
a
pacific
people
,
''
said
Duncan
,
``
and
that
*NL*
they
never
waged
war
in
person
;
trusting
the
defense
of
their
hands
to
*NL*
those
very
Mohawks
that
you
slew
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
true
in
part
,
''
returned
the
scout
,
``
and
yet
,
at
the
bottom
,
't
is
*NL*
a
wicked
lie
.
Such
a
treaty
was
made
in
ages
gone
by
,
through
the
*NL*
deviltries
of
the
Dutchers
,
who
wished
to
disarm
the
natives
that
had
*NL*
the
best
right
to
the
country
,
where
they
had
settled
themselves
.
The
*NL*
Mohicans
,
though
a
part
of
the
same
nation
,
having
to
deal
with
the
*NL*
English
,
never
entered
into
the
silly
bargain
,
but
kept
to
their
*NL*
manhood
;
as
in
truth
did
the
Delawares
,
when
their
eyes
were
open
to
*NL*
their
folly
.
You
see
before
you
a
chief
of
the
great
Mohican
Sagamores
!
*NL*
Once
his
family
could
chase
their
deer
over
tracts
of
country
wider
than
*NL*
that
which
belongs
to
the
Albany
Patteroon
,
without
crossing
brook
or
*NL*
hill
that
was
not
their
own
;
but
what
is
left
of
their
descendant
?
He
*NL*
may
find
his
six
feet
of
earth
when
God
chooses
,
and
keep
it
in
peace
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
if
he
has
a
friend
who
will
take
the
pains
to
sink
his
head
so
*NL*
low
that
the
plowshares
can
not
reach
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Enough
!
''
said
Heyward
,
apprehensive
that
the
subject
might
lead
to
*NL*
a
discussion
that
would
interrupt
the
harmony
so
necessary
to
the
*NL*
preservation
of
his
fair
companions
;
``
we
have
journeyed
far
,
and
few
*NL*
among
us
are
blessed
with
forms
like
that
of
yours
,
which
seems
to
know
*NL*
neither
fatigue
nor
weakness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
sinews
and
bones
of
a
man
carry
me
through
it
all
,
''
said
the
*NL*
hunter
,
surveying
his
muscular
limbs
with
a
simplicity
that
betrayed
*NL*
the
honest
pleasure
the
compliment
afforded
him
;
``
there
are
larger
and
*NL*
heavier
men
to
be
found
in
the
settlements
,
but
you
might
travel
many
*NL*
days
in
a
city
before
you
could
meet
one
able
to
walk
fifty
miles
*NL*
without
stopping
to
take
breath
,
or
who
has
kept
the
hounds
within
*NL*
hearing
during
a
chase
of
hours
.
However
,
as
flesh
and
blood
are
not
*NL*
always
the
same
,
it
is
quite
reasonable
to
suppose
that
the
gentle
ones
*NL*
are
willing
to
rest
,
after
all
they
have
seen
and
done
this
day
.
Uncas
,
*NL*
clear
out
the
spring
,
while
your
father
and
I
make
a
cover
for
their
*NL*
tender
heads
of
these
chestnut
shoots
,
and
a
bed
of
grass
and
leaves
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
dialogue
ceased
,
while
the
hunter
and
his
companions
busied
*NL*
themselves
in
preparations
for
the
comfort
and
protection
of
those
they
*NL*
guided
.
A
spring
,
which
many
long
years
before
had
induced
the
natives
*NL*
to
select
the
place
for
their
temporary
fortification
,
was
soon
cleared
*NL*
of
leaves
,
and
a
fountain
of
crystal
gushed
from
the
bed
,
diffusing
*NL*
its
waters
over
the
verdant
hillock
.
A
corner
of
the
building
was
then
*NL*
roofed
in
such
a
manner
as
to
exclude
the
heavy
dew
of
the
climate
,
*NL*
and
piles
of
sweet
shrubs
and
dried
leaves
were
laid
beneath
it
for
the
*NL*
sisters
to
repose
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
the
diligent
woodsmen
were
employed
in
this
manner
,
Cora
and
*NL*
Alice
partook
of
that
refreshment
which
duty
required
much
more
than
*NL*
inclination
prompted
them
to
accept
.
They
then
retired
within
the
*NL*
walls
,
and
first
offering
up
their
thanksgivings
for
past
mercies
,
and
*NL*
petitioning
for
a
continuance
of
the
Divine
favor
throughout
the
coming
*NL*
night
,
they
laid
their
tender
forms
on
the
fragrant
couch
,
and
in
spite
*NL*
of
recollections
and
forebodings
,
soon
sank
into
those
slumbers
which
*NL*
nature
so
imperiously
demanded
,
and
which
were
sweetened
by
hopes
*NL*
for
the
morrow
.
Duncan
had
prepared
himself
to
pass
the
night
in
*NL*
watchfulness
near
them
,
just
without
the
ruin
,
but
the
scout
,
perceiving
*NL*
his
intention
,
pointed
toward
Chingachgook
,
as
he
coolly
disposed
his
*NL*
own
person
on
the
grass
,
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
eyes
of
a
white
man
are
too
heavy
and
too
blind
for
such
a
watch
as
*NL*
this
!
The
Mohican
will
be
our
sentinel
,
therefore
let
us
sleep
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
proved
myself
a
sluggard
on
my
post
during
the
past
night
,
''
said
*NL*
Heyward
,
``
and
have
less
need
of
repose
than
you
,
who
did
more
credit
*NL*
to
the
character
of
a
soldier
.
Let
all
the
party
seek
their
rest
,
then
,
*NL*
while
I
hold
the
guard
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
we
lay
among
the
white
tents
of
the
Sixtieth
,
and
in
front
of
an
*NL*
enemy
like
the
French
,
I
could
not
ask
for
a
better
watchman
,
''
returned
*NL*
the
scout
;
``
but
in
the
darkness
and
among
the
signs
of
the
wilderness
*NL*
your
judgment
would
be
like
the
folly
of
a
child
,
and
your
vigilance
*NL*
thrown
away
.
Do
then
,
like
Uncas
and
myself
,
sleep
,
and
sleep
in
*NL*
safety
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Heyward
perceived
,
in
truth
,
that
the
younger
Indian
had
thrown
his
form
*NL*
on
the
side
of
the
hillock
while
they
were
talking
,
like
one
who
sought
*NL*
to
make
the
most
of
the
time
allotted
to
rest
,
and
that
his
example
had
*NL*
been
followed
by
David
,
whose
voice
literally
``
clove
to
his
jaws
,
''
with
*NL*
the
fever
of
his
wound
,
heightened
,
as
it
was
,
by
their
toilsome
march
.
*NL*
Unwilling
to
prolong
a
useless
discussion
,
the
young
man
affected
to
*NL*
comply
,
by
posting
his
back
against
the
logs
of
the
blockhouse
,
in
a
*NL*
half
recumbent
posture
,
though
resolutely
determined
,
in
his
own
mind
,
*NL*
not
to
close
an
eye
until
he
had
delivered
his
precious
charge
into
the
*NL*
arms
of
Munro
himself
.
Hawkeye
,
believing
he
had
prevailed
,
soon
fell
*NL*
asleep
,
and
a
silence
as
deep
as
the
solitude
in
which
they
had
found
*NL*
it
,
pervaded
the
retired
spot
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
many
minutes
Duncan
succeeded
in
keeping
his
senses
on
the
alert
,
*NL*
and
alive
to
every
moaning
sound
that
arose
from
the
forest
.
His
vision
*NL*
became
more
acute
as
the
shades
of
evening
settled
on
the
place
;
and
*NL*
even
after
the
stars
were
glimmering
above
his
head
,
he
was
able
to
*NL*
distinguish
the
recumbent
forms
of
his
companions
,
as
they
lay
stretched
*NL*
on
the
grass
,
and
to
note
the
person
of
Chingachgook
,
who
sat
upright
*NL*
and
motionless
as
one
of
the
trees
which
formed
the
dark
barrier
on
*NL*
every
side
.
He
still
heard
the
gentle
breathings
of
the
sisters
,
who
lay
*NL*
within
a
few
feet
of
him
,
and
not
a
leaf
was
ruffled
by
the
passing
*NL*
air
of
which
his
ear
did
not
detect
the
whispering
sound
.
At
length
,
*NL*
however
,
the
mournful
notes
of
a
whip-poor-will
became
blended
with
the
*NL*
moanings
of
an
owl
;
his
heavy
eyes
occasionally
sought
the
bright
rays
*NL*
of
the
stars
,
and
he
then
fancied
he
saw
them
through
the
fallen
lids
.
*NL*
At
instants
of
momentary
wakefulness
he
mistook
a
bush
for
his
associate
*NL*
sentinel
;
his
head
next
sank
upon
his
shoulder
,
which
,
in
its
turn
,
*NL*
sought
the
support
of
the
ground
;
and
,
finally
,
his
whole
person
became
*NL*
relaxed
and
pliant
,
and
the
young
man
sank
into
a
deep
sleep
,
dreaming
*NL*
that
he
was
a
knight
of
ancient
chivalry
,
holding
his
midnight
vigils
*NL*
before
the
tent
of
a
recaptured
princess
,
whose
favor
he
did
not
despair
*NL*
of
gaining
,
by
such
a
proof
of
devotion
and
watchfulness
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
long
the
tired
Duncan
lay
in
this
insensible
state
he
never
*NL*
knew
himself
,
but
his
slumbering
visions
had
been
long
lost
in
total
*NL*
forgetfulness
,
when
he
was
awakened
by
a
light
tap
on
the
shoulder
.
*NL*
Aroused
by
this
signal
,
slight
as
it
was
,
he
sprang
upon
his
feet
with
*NL*
a
confused
recollection
of
the
self-imposed
duty
he
had
assumed
with
the
*NL*
commencement
of
the
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
comes
?
''
he
demanded
,
feeling
for
his
sword
,
at
the
place
where
it
*NL*
was
usually
suspended
.
``
Speak
!
friend
or
enemy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Friend
,
''
replied
the
low
voice
of
Chingachgook
;
who
,
pointing
upward
*NL*
at
the
luminary
which
was
shedding
its
mild
light
through
the
opening
*NL*
in
the
trees
,
directly
in
their
bivouac
,
immediately
added
,
in
his
rude
*NL*
English
:
``
Moon
comes
and
white
man
's
fort
far
--
far
off
;
time
to
move
,
*NL*
when
sleep
shuts
both
eyes
of
the
Frenchman
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
say
true
!
Call
up
your
friends
,
and
bridle
the
horses
while
I
*NL*
prepare
my
own
companions
for
the
march
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
awake
,
Duncan
,
''
said
the
soft
,
silvery
tones
of
Alice
within
the
*NL*
building
,
``
and
ready
to
travel
very
fast
after
so
refreshing
a
sleep
;
*NL*
but
you
have
watched
through
the
tedious
night
in
our
behalf
,
after
*NL*
having
endured
so
much
fatigue
the
livelong
day
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
,
rather
,
I
would
have
watched
,
but
my
treacherous
eyes
betrayed
me
;
*NL*
twice
have
I
proved
myself
unfit
for
the
trust
I
bear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
Duncan
,
deny
it
not
,
''
interrupted
the
smiling
Alice
,
issuing
*NL*
from
the
shadows
of
the
building
into
the
light
of
the
moon
,
in
all
the
*NL*
loveliness
of
her
freshened
beauty
;
``
I
know
you
to
be
a
heedless
one
,
*NL*
when
self
is
the
object
of
your
care
,
and
but
too
vigilant
in
favor
of
*NL*
others
.
Can
we
not
tarry
here
a
little
longer
while
you
find
the
rest
*NL*
you
need
?
Cheerfully
,
most
cheerfully
,
will
Cora
and
I
keep
the
vigils
,
*NL*
while
you
and
all
these
brave
men
endeavor
to
snatch
a
little
sleep
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
shame
could
cure
me
of
my
drowsiness
,
I
should
never
close
an
eye
*NL*
again
,
''
said
the
uneasy
youth
,
gazing
at
the
ingenuous
countenance
*NL*
of
Alice
,
where
,
however
,
in
its
sweet
solicitude
,
he
read
nothing
to
*NL*
confirm
his
half-awakened
suspicion
.
``
It
is
but
too
true
,
that
after
*NL*
leading
you
into
danger
by
my
heedlessness
,
I
have
not
even
the
merit
of
*NL*
guarding
your
pillows
as
should
become
a
soldier
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
one
but
Duncan
himself
should
accuse
Duncan
of
such
a
weakness
.
Go
,
*NL*
then
,
and
sleep
;
believe
me
,
neither
of
us
,
weak
girls
as
we
are
,
will
*NL*
betray
our
watch
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
was
relieved
from
the
awkwardness
of
making
any
further
*NL*
protestations
of
his
own
demerits
,
by
an
exclamation
from
Chingachgook
,
*NL*
and
the
attitude
of
riveted
attention
assumed
by
his
son
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Mohicans
hear
an
enemy
!
''
whispered
Hawkeye
,
who
,
by
this
time
,
in
*NL*
common
with
the
whole
party
,
was
awake
and
stirring
.
``
They
scent
danger
*NL*
in
the
wind
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
forbid
!
''
exclaimed
Heyward
.
``
Surely
we
have
had
enough
of
*NL*
bloodshed
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
he
spoke
,
however
,
the
young
soldier
seized
his
rifle
,
and
*NL*
advancing
toward
the
front
,
prepared
to
atone
for
his
venial
remissness
,
*NL*
by
freely
exposing
his
life
in
defense
of
those
he
attended
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
some
creature
of
the
forest
prowling
around
us
in
quest
of
food
,
''
*NL*
he
said
,
in
a
whisper
,
as
soon
as
the
low
,
and
apparently
distant
*NL*
sounds
,
which
had
startled
the
Mohicans
,
reached
his
own
ears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hist
!
''
returned
the
attentive
scout
;
''
't
is
man
;
even
I
can
now
tell
*NL*
his
tread
,
poor
as
my
senses
are
when
compared
to
an
Indian
's
!
That
*NL*
Scampering
Huron
has
fallen
in
with
one
of
Montcalm
's
outlying
parties
,
*NL*
and
they
have
struck
upon
our
trail
.
I
should
n't
like
,
myself
,
to
spill
*NL*
more
human
blood
in
this
spot
,
''
he
added
,
looking
around
with
anxiety
in
*NL*
his
features
,
at
the
dim
objects
by
which
he
was
surrounded
;
``
but
what
*NL*
must
be
,
must
!
Lead
the
horses
into
the
blockhouse
,
Uncas
;
and
,
friends
,
*NL*
do
you
follow
to
the
same
shelter
.
Poor
and
old
as
it
is
,
it
offers
a
*NL*
cover
,
and
has
rung
with
the
crack
of
a
rifle
afore
to-night
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
instantly
obeyed
,
the
Mohicans
leading
the
Narrangansetts
*NL*
within
the
ruin
,
whither
the
whole
party
repaired
with
the
most
guarded
*NL*
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sound
of
approaching
footsteps
were
now
too
distinctly
audible
to
*NL*
leave
any
doubts
as
to
the
nature
of
the
interruption
.
They
were
soon
*NL*
mingled
with
voices
calling
to
each
other
in
an
Indian
dialect
,
which
*NL*
the
hunter
,
in
a
whisper
,
affirmed
to
Heyward
was
the
language
of
the
*NL*
Hurons
.
When
the
party
reached
the
point
where
the
horses
had
entered
*NL*
the
thicket
which
surrounded
the
blockhouse
,
they
were
evidently
at
*NL*
fault
,
having
lost
those
marks
which
,
until
that
moment
,
had
directed
*NL*
their
pursuit
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
would
seem
by
the
voices
that
twenty
men
were
soon
collected
at
that
*NL*
one
spot
,
mingling
their
different
opinions
and
advice
in
noisy
clamor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
knaves
know
our
weakness
,
''
whispered
Hawkeye
,
who
stood
by
the
side
*NL*
of
Heyward
,
in
deep
shade
,
looking
through
an
opening
in
the
logs
,
``
or
*NL*
they
would
n't
indulge
their
idleness
in
such
a
squaw
's
march
.
Listen
to
*NL*
the
reptiles
!
each
man
among
them
seems
to
have
two
tongues
,
and
but
a
*NL*
single
leg
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Duncan
,
brave
as
he
was
in
the
combat
,
could
not
,
in
such
a
moment
of
*NL*
painful
suspense
,
make
any
reply
to
the
cool
and
characteristic
remark
*NL*
of
the
scout
.
He
only
grasped
his
rifle
more
firmly
,
and
fastened
his
*NL*
eyes
upon
the
narrow
opening
,
through
which
he
gazed
upon
the
moonlight
*NL*
view
with
increasing
anxiety
.
The
deeper
tones
of
one
who
spoke
as
*NL*
having
authority
were
next
heard
,
amid
a
silence
that
denoted
the
*NL*
respect
with
which
his
orders
,
or
rather
advice
,
was
received
.
After
*NL*
which
,
by
the
rustling
of
leaves
,
and
crackling
of
dried
twigs
,
it
*NL*
was
apparent
the
savages
were
separating
in
pursuit
of
the
lost
trail
.
*NL*
Fortunately
for
the
pursued
,
the
light
of
the
moon
,
while
it
shed
a
*NL*
flood
of
mild
luster
upon
the
little
area
around
the
ruin
,
was
not
*NL*
sufficiently
strong
to
penetrate
the
deep
arches
of
the
forest
,
where
*NL*
the
objects
still
lay
in
deceptive
shadow
.
The
search
proved
fruitless
;
*NL*
for
so
short
and
sudden
had
been
the
passage
from
the
faint
path
the
*NL*
travelers
had
journeyed
into
the
thicket
,
that
every
trace
of
their
*NL*
footsteps
was
lost
in
the
obscurity
of
the
woods
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
long
,
however
,
before
the
restless
savages
were
heard
beating
*NL*
the
brush
,
and
gradually
approaching
the
inner
edge
of
that
dense
border
*NL*
of
young
chestnuts
which
encircled
the
little
area
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
coming
,
''
muttered
Heyward
,
endeavoring
to
thrust
his
rifle
*NL*
through
the
chink
in
the
logs
;
``
let
us
fire
on
their
approach
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Keep
everything
in
the
shade
,
''
returned
the
scout
;
``
the
snapping
of
*NL*
a
flint
,
or
even
the
smell
of
a
single
karnel
of
the
brimstone
,
would
*NL*
bring
the
hungry
varlets
upon
us
in
a
body
.
Should
it
please
God
that
we
*NL*
must
give
battle
for
the
scalps
,
trust
to
the
experience
of
men
who
*NL*
know
the
ways
of
the
savages
,
and
who
are
not
often
backward
when
the
*NL*
war-whoop
is
howled
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Duncan
cast
his
eyes
behind
him
,
and
saw
that
the
trembling
sisters
were
*NL*
cowering
in
the
far
corner
of
the
building
,
while
the
Mohicans
stood
in
*NL*
the
shadow
,
like
two
upright
posts
,
ready
,
and
apparently
willing
,
to
*NL*
strike
when
the
blow
should
be
needed
.
Curbing
his
impatience
,
he
again
*NL*
looked
out
upon
the
area
,
and
awaited
the
result
in
silence
.
At
that
*NL*
instant
the
thicket
opened
,
and
a
tall
and
armed
Huron
advanced
a
few
*NL*
paces
into
the
open
space
.
As
he
gazed
upon
the
silent
blockhouse
,
the
*NL*
moon
fell
upon
his
swarthy
countenance
,
and
betrayed
its
surprise
and
*NL*
curiosity
.
He
made
the
exclamation
which
usually
accompanies
the
former
*NL*
emotion
in
an
Indian
,
and
,
calling
in
a
low
voice
,
soon
drew
a
companion
*NL*
to
his
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
children
of
the
woods
stood
together
for
several
moments
pointing
*NL*
at
the
crumbling
edifice
,
and
conversing
in
the
unintelligible
language
*NL*
of
their
tribe
.
They
then
approached
,
though
with
slow
and
cautious
*NL*
steps
,
pausing
every
instant
to
look
at
the
building
,
like
startled
deer
*NL*
whose
curiosity
struggled
powerfully
with
their
awakened
apprehensions
*NL*
for
the
mastery
.
The
foot
of
one
of
them
suddenly
rested
on
the
mound
,
*NL*
and
he
stopped
to
examine
its
nature
.
At
this
moment
,
Heyward
observed
*NL*
that
the
scout
loosened
his
knife
in
its
sheath
,
and
lowered
the
muzzle
*NL*
of
his
rifle
.
Imitating
these
movements
,
the
young
man
prepared
himself
*NL*
for
the
struggle
which
now
seemed
inevitable
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
savages
were
so
near
,
that
the
least
motion
in
one
of
the
horses
,
or
*NL*
even
a
breath
louder
than
common
,
would
have
betrayed
the
fugitives
.
But
*NL*
in
discovering
the
character
of
the
mound
,
the
attention
of
the
Hurons
*NL*
appeared
directed
to
a
different
object
.
They
spoke
together
,
and
*NL*
the
sounds
of
their
voices
were
low
and
solemn
,
as
if
influenced
by
a
*NL*
reverence
that
was
deeply
blended
with
awe
.
Then
they
drew
warily
back
,
*NL*
keeping
their
eyes
riveted
on
the
ruin
,
as
if
they
expected
to
see
*NL*
the
apparitions
of
the
dead
issue
from
its
silent
walls
,
until
,
having
*NL*
reached
the
boundary
of
the
area
,
they
moved
slowly
into
the
thicket
and
*NL*
disappeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hawkeye
dropped
the
breech
of
his
rifle
to
the
earth
,
and
drawing
a
*NL*
long
,
free
breath
,
exclaimed
,
in
an
audible
whisper
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
!
they
respect
the
dead
,
and
it
has
this
time
saved
their
own
lives
,
*NL*
and
,
it
may
be
,
the
lives
of
better
men
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Heyward
lent
his
attention
for
a
single
moment
to
his
companion
,
but
*NL*
without
replying
,
he
again
turned
toward
those
who
just
then
interested
*NL*
him
more
.
He
heard
the
two
Hurons
leave
the
bushes
,
and
it
was
soon
*NL*
plain
that
all
the
pursuers
were
gathered
about
them
,
in
deep
attention
*NL*
to
their
report
.
After
a
few
minutes
of
earnest
and
solemn
dialogue
,
*NL*
altogether
different
from
the
noisy
clamor
with
which
they
had
first
*NL*
collected
about
the
spot
,
the
sounds
grew
fainter
and
more
distant
,
and
*NL*
finally
were
lost
in
the
depths
of
the
forest
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hawkeye
waited
until
a
signal
from
the
listening
Chingachgook
assured
*NL*
him
that
every
sound
from
the
retiring
party
was
completely
swallowed
by
*NL*
the
distance
,
when
he
motioned
to
Heyward
to
lead
forth
the
horses
,
and
*NL*
to
assist
the
sisters
into
their
saddles
.
The
instant
this
was
done
*NL*
they
issued
through
the
broken
gateway
,
and
stealing
out
by
a
direction
*NL*
opposite
to
the
one
by
which
they
entered
,
they
quitted
the
spot
,
the
*NL*
sisters
casting
furtive
glances
at
the
silent
,
grave
and
crumbling
ruin
,
*NL*
as
they
left
the
soft
light
of
the
moon
,
to
bury
themselves
in
the
gloom
*NL*
of
the
woods
.

''
*NL*
--
King
Henry
VI
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
rapid
movement
from
the
blockhouse
,
and
until
the
party
was
*NL*
deeply
buried
in
the
forest
,
each
individual
was
too
much
interested
in
*NL*
the
escape
to
hazard
a
word
even
in
whispers
.
The
scout
resumed
his
*NL*
post
in
advance
,
though
his
steps
,
after
he
had
thrown
a
safe
distance
*NL*
between
himself
and
his
enemies
,
were
more
deliberate
than
in
their
*NL*
previous
march
,
in
consequence
of
his
utter
ignorance
of
the
localities
*NL*
of
the
surrounding
woods
.
More
than
once
he
halted
to
consult
with
his
*NL*
confederates
,
the
Mohicans
,
pointing
upward
at
the
moon
,
and
examining
*NL*
the
barks
of
the
trees
with
care
.
In
these
brief
pauses
,
Heyward
and
the
*NL*
sisters
listened
,
with
senses
rendered
doubly
acute
by
the
danger
,
to
*NL*
detect
any
symptoms
which
might
announce
the
proximity
of
their
foes
.
*NL*
At
such
moments
,
it
seemed
as
if
a
vast
range
of
country
lay
buried
in
*NL*
eternal
sleep
;
not
the
least
sound
arising
from
the
forest
,
unless
it
*NL*
was
the
distant
and
scarcely
audible
rippling
of
a
water-course
.
Birds
,
*NL*
beasts
,
and
man
,
appeared
to
slumber
alike
,
if
,
indeed
,
any
of
the
*NL*
latter
were
to
be
found
in
that
wide
tract
of
wilderness
.
But
the
sounds
*NL*
of
the
rivulet
,
feeble
and
murmuring
as
they
were
,
relieved
the
guides
*NL*
at
once
from
no
trifling
embarrassment
,
and
toward
it
they
immediately
*NL*
held
their
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
banks
of
the
little
stream
were
gained
,
Hawkeye
made
another
*NL*
halt
;
and
taking
the
moccasins
from
his
feet
,
he
invited
Heyward
and
*NL*
Gamut
to
follow
his
example
.
He
then
entered
the
water
,
and
for
near
an
*NL*
hour
they
traveled
in
the
bed
of
the
brook
,
leaving
no
trail
.
The
*NL*
moon
had
already
sunk
into
an
immense
pile
of
black
clouds
,
which
lay
*NL*
impending
above
the
western
horizon
,
when
they
issued
from
the
low
and
*NL*
devious
water-course
to
rise
again
to
the
light
and
level
of
the
sandy
*NL*
but
wooded
plain
.
Here
the
scout
seemed
to
be
once
more
at
home
,
for
he
*NL*
held
on
this
way
with
the
certainty
and
diligence
of
a
man
who
moved
in
*NL*
the
security
of
his
own
knowledge
.
The
path
soon
became
more
uneven
,
and
*NL*
the
travelers
could
plainly
perceive
that
the
mountains
drew
nigher
to
*NL*
them
on
each
hand
,
and
that
they
were
,
in
truth
,
about
entering
one
of
*NL*
their
gorges
.
Suddenly
,
Hawkeye
made
a
pause
,
and
,
waiting
until
he
*NL*
was
joined
by
the
whole
party
,
he
spoke
,
though
in
tones
so
low
and
*NL*
cautious
,
that
they
added
to
the
solemnity
of
his
words
,
in
the
quiet
*NL*
and
darkness
of
the
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
easy
to
know
the
pathways
,
and
to
find
the
licks
and
*NL*
water-courses
of
the
wilderness
,
''
he
said
;
``
but
who
that
saw
this
spot
*NL*
could
venture
to
say
,
that
a
mighty
army
was
at
rest
among
yonder
silent
*NL*
trees
and
barren
mountains
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
,
then
,
at
no
great
distance
from
William
Henry
?
''
said
Heyward
,
*NL*
advancing
nigher
to
the
scout
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
yet
a
long
and
weary
path
,
and
when
and
where
to
strike
it
is
*NL*
now
our
greatest
difficulty
.
See
,
''
he
said
,
pointing
through
the
trees
*NL*
toward
a
spot
where
a
little
basin
of
water
reflected
the
stars
from
its
*NL*
placid
bosom
,
``
here
is
the
`
bloody
pond
'
;
and
I
am
on
ground
that
I
have
*NL*
not
only
often
traveled
,
but
over
which
I
have
fou
'
t
the
enemy
,
from
the
*NL*
rising
to
the
setting
sun
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ha
!
that
sheet
of
dull
and
dreary
water
,
then
,
is
the
sepulcher
of
the
*NL*
brave
men
who
fell
in
the
contest
.
I
have
heard
it
named
,
but
never
have
*NL*
I
stood
on
its
banks
before
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Three
battles
did
we
make
with
the
Dutch-Frenchman
*
in
a
day
,
''
*NL*
continued
Hawkeye
,
pursuing
the
train
of
his
own
thoughts
,
rather
than
*NL*
replying
to
the
remark
of
Duncan
.
``
He
met
us
hard
by
,
in
our
outward
*NL*
march
to
ambush
his
advance
,
and
scattered
us
,
like
driven
deer
,
through
*NL*
the
defile
,
to
the
shores
of
Horican
.
Then
we
rallied
behind
our
fallen
*NL*
trees
,
and
made
head
against
him
,
under
Sir
William
--
who
was
made
Sir
*NL*
William
for
that
very
deed
;
and
well
did
we
pay
him
for
the
disgrace
*NL*
of
the
morning
!
Hundreds
of
Frenchmen
saw
the
sun
that
day
for
the
last
*NL*
time
;
and
even
their
leader
,
Dieskau
himself
,
fell
into
our
hands
,
so
*NL*
cut
and
torn
with
the
lead
,
that
he
has
gone
back
to
his
own
country
,
*NL*
unfit
for
further
acts
in
war

in

service

A
few
*NL*
years
previously
to
the
period
of
the
tale
,
this
officer
was
*NL*
defeated
by
Sir
William
Johnson
,
of
Johnstown
,
New

,
on
*NL*
the
shores
of
Lake
George
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
was
a
noble
repulse
!
''
exclaimed
Heyward
,
in
the
heat
of
his
youthful
*NL*
ardor
;
``
the
fame
of
it
reached
us
early
,
in
our
southern
army
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
!
but
it
did
not
end
there

I
was
sent
by
Major
Effingham

at
Sir

William
's
own
bidding
,
to
outflank
the
French
,
and
carry
the
tidings
*NL*
of
their
disaster
across
the
portage
,
to
the
fort
on
the
Hudson
.
Just
*NL*
hereaway
,
where
you
see
the
trees
rise
into
a
mountain
swell
,
I
met
a
*NL*
party
coming
down
to
our
aid
,
and
I
led
them
where
the
enemy
were
taking
*NL*
their
meal
,
little
dreaming
that
they
had
not
finished
the
bloody
work
*NL*
of
the
day

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
surprised

``
If

can
be
a

We
gave
them
but
little
breathing
time
,
for
they
had
*NL*
borne
hard
upon
us
in
the
fight
of
the
morning

there
were

``
When
all
was
over
,
the
dead
,

some

the
dying

were
cast
into
*NL*
that
little
pond

These
eyes
have
seen
its
waters
colored
with
blood

natural
water
never
yet
flowed
from
the
bowels
of

``
It
was
a
convenient
,

I
trust

will
prove
a
peaceful

You
have
then
seen
much
service
on
this
frontier
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
!
''
said
the
scout
,
erecting
his
tall
person
with
an
air
of
military
*NL*
pride
;
``
there
are
not
many
echoes
among
these
hills
that
have
n't
rung
*NL*
with

is
there
the
space

dropped

As
for

mention

another
matter

certain
it
is
that
in

returned
the
scout
,
*NL*
grasping
the
shoulder
of
Heyward
with
such
convulsive
strength
as
to
*NL*
make
the
young
soldier
painfully
sensible
how
much
superstitious
terror
*NL*
had
got
the
mastery
of
a
man
usually
so
dauntless
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
heaven
,
there
is
a
human
form
,
and
it
approaches
!
Stand
to
your
*NL*
arms
,
my
friends
;
for
we
know
not
whom
we
encounter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Qui
vive
?
''
demanded
a
stern
,
quick
voice
,
which
sounded
like
a
*NL*
challenge
from
another
world
,
issuing
out
of
that
solitary
and
solemn
*NL*
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
says
it
?
''
whispered
the
scout
;
``
it
speaks
neither
Indian
nor
*NL*
English
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Qui
vive
?
''
repeated
the
same
voice
,
which
was
quickly
followed
by
the
*NL*
rattling
of
arms
,
and
a
menacing
attitude
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
France
!
''
cried
Heyward
,
advancing
from
the
shadow
of
the
trees
to
the
*NL*
shore
of
the
pond
,
within
a
few
yards
of
the
sentinel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
D'ou
venez-vous
--
ou
allez-vous
,
d'aussi
bonne
heure
?
''
demanded
the
*NL*
grenadier
,
in
the
language
and
with
the
accent
of
a
man
from
old
France
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Je
viens
de
la
decouverte
,
et
je
vais
me
coucher
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Etes-vous
officier
du
roi

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sans
doute
,
mon
camarade
;
me
prends-tu
pour
un
provincial

Je

Heyward
well
knew
that
the
other
was
of
a
*NL*
regiment
in
the
line
-RRB-
;
j'
ai
ici
,
avec
moi
,
les

du

*NL*
de
la
fortification
.
Aha
!
tu
en
as
entendu
parler
!
je
les
ai
fait
*NL*
prisonnieres
pres
de
l'autre
fort
,
et
je
les
conduis
au
general
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ma
foi
!
mesdames
;
j'
en
suis
fache
pour
vous
,
''
exclaimed
the
young
*NL*
soldier
,
touching
his
cap
with
grace
;
``
mais
--
fortune
de
guerre
!
vous
*NL*
trouverez
notre
general
un
brave
homme
,
et
bien
poli

.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
C'est
le
caractere
des
gens
de

,
''
said
Cora
,
with
admirable
*NL*
self-possession
.
``
Adieu
,
mon
ami
;
je
vous
souhaiterais
un
devoir
plus
*NL*
agreable
a
remplir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
soldier
made
a
low
and
humble
acknowledgment
for
her
civility
;
and
*NL*
Heyward
adding
a
``
Bonne
nuit
,
mon
camarade
,
''
they
moved
deliberately
*NL*
forward
,
leaving
the
sentinel
pacing
the
banks
of
the
silent
pond
,
*NL*
little
suspecting
an
enemy
of
so
much
effrontery
,
and
humming
to
himself
*NL*
those
words
which
were
recalled
to
his
mind
by
the
sight
of
women
,
and
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
by
recollections
of
his
own
distant
and
beautiful
France
:
``
Vive
*NL*
le
vin
,
vive
l'amour
,
''
etc.
,
etc.
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
well
you
understood
the
knave
!
''
whispered
the
scout
,
when
they
had
*NL*
gained
a
little
distance
from
the
place
,
and
letting
his
rifle
fall
into
*NL*
the
hollow
of
his
arm
again
;
``
I
soon
saw
that
he
was
one
of
them
uneasy
*NL*
Frenchers
;
and
well
for
him
it
was
that
his
speech
was
friendly
and
his
*NL*
wishes
kind
,
or
a
place
might
have
been
found
for
his
bones
among
those
*NL*
of
his
countrymen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
interrupted
by
a
long
and
heavy
groan
which
arose
from
the
little
*NL*
basin
,
as
though
,
in
truth
,
the
spirits
of
the
departed
lingered
about
*NL*
their
watery
sepulcher
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Surely
it
was
of
flesh
,
''
continued
the
scout
;
``
no
spirit
could
handle
*NL*
its
arms
so
steadily
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
of
flesh
;
but
whether
the
poor
fellow
still
belongs
to
this
*NL*
world
may
well
be
doubted
,
''
said
Heyward
,
glancing
his
eyes
around
him
,
*NL*
and
missing
Chingachgook
from
their
little
band
.
Another
groan
more
*NL*
faint
than
the
former
was
succeeded
by
a
heavy
and
sullen
plunge
into
*NL*
the
water
,
and
all
was
still
again
as
if
the
borders
of
the
dreary
pool
*NL*
had
never
been
awakened
from
the
silence
of
creation
.
While
they
yet
*NL*
hesitated
in
uncertainty
,
the
form
of
the
Indian
was
seen
gliding
out
of
*NL*
the
thicket
.
As
the
chief
rejoined
them
,
with
one
hand
he
attached
the
*NL*
reeking
scalp
of
the
unfortunate
young
Frenchman
to
his
girdle
,
and
with
*NL*
the
other
he
replaced
the
knife
and
tomahawk
that
had
drunk
his
blood
.
*NL*
He
then
took
his
wonted
station
,
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
believed
he
*NL*
had
done
a
deed
of
merit
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
scout
dropped
one
end
of
his
rifle
to
the
earth
,
and
leaning
his
*NL*
hands
on
the
other
,
he
stood
musing
in
profound
silence
.
Then
,
shaking
*NL*
his
head
in
a
mournful
manner
,
he
muttered
:
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Twould
have
been
a
cruel
and
an
unhuman
act
for
a
white-skin
;
but
't
is
*NL*
the
gift
and
natur
'
of
an
Indian
,
and
I
suppose
it
should
not
be
denied
.
*NL*
I
could
wish
,
though
,
it
had
befallen
an
accursed
Mingo
,
rather
than
*NL*
that
gay
young
boy
from
the
old
countries
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Enough
!
''
said
Heyward
,
apprehensive
the
unconscious
sisters
might
*NL*
comprehend
the
nature
of
the
detention
,
and
conquering
his
disgust
by
a
*NL*
train
of
reflections
very
much
like
that
of
the
hunter
;
''
't
is
done
;
and
*NL*
though
better
it
were
left
undone
,
can
not
be
amended
.
You
see
,
we
are
,
*NL*
too
obviously
within
the
sentinels
of
the
enemy
;
what
course
do
you
*NL*
propose
to
follow
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Hawkeye
,
rousing
himself
again
;
''
't
is
as
you
say
,
too
late
*NL*
to
harbor
further
thoughts
about
it
.
Ay
,
the
French
have
gathered
around
*NL*
the
fort
in
good
earnest
and
we
have
a
delicate
needle
to
thread
in
*NL*
passing
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
but
little
time
to
do
it
in
,
''
added
Heyward
,
glancing
his
eyes
*NL*
upwards
,
toward
the
bank
of
vapor
that
concealed
the
setting
moon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
little
time
to
do
it
in
!
''
repeated
the
scout
.
``
The
thing
may
be
*NL*
done
in
two
fashions
,
by
the
help
of
Providence
,
without
which
it
may
*NL*
not
be
done
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Name
them
quickly
for
time
presses
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
would
be
to
dismount
the
gentle
ones
,
and
let
their
beasts
range
*NL*
the
plain
,
by
sending
the
Mohicans
in
front
,
we
might
then
cut
a
lane
*NL*
through
their
sentries
,
and
enter
the
fort
over
the
dead
bodies
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
will
not
do
--
it
will
not
do
!
''
interrupted
the
generous
Heyward
;
*NL*
``
a
soldier
might
force
his
way
in
this
manner
,
but
never
with
such
a
*NL*
convoy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Twould
be
,
indeed
,
a
bloody
path
for
such
tender
feet
to
wade
in
,
''
*NL*
returned
the
equally
reluctant
scout
;
``
but
I
thought
it
befitting
my
*NL*
manhood
to
name
it
.
We
must
,
then
,
turn
in
our
trail
and
get
without
the
*NL*
line
of
their
lookouts
,
when
we
will
bend
short
to
the
west
,
and
enter
*NL*
the
mountains
;
where
I
can
hide
you
,
so
that
all
the
devil
's
hounds
in
*NL*
Montcalm
's
pay
would
be
thrown
off
the
scent
for
months
to
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
it
be
done
,
and
that
instantly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Further
words
were
unnecessary
;
for
Hawkeye
,
merely
uttering
the
mandate
*NL*
to
``
follow
,
''
moved
along
the
route
by
which
they
had
just
entered
their
*NL*
present
critical
and
even
dangerous
situation
.
Their
progress
,
like
*NL*
their
late
dialogue
,
was
guarded
,
and
without
noise
;
for
none
knew
at
*NL*
what
moment
a
passing
patrol
,
or
a
crouching
picket
of
the
enemy
,
might
*NL*
rise
upon
their
path
.
As
they
held
their
silent
way
along
the
margin
*NL*
of
the
pond
,
again
Heyward
and
the
scout
stole
furtive
glances
at
its
*NL*
appalling
dreariness
.
They
looked
in
vain
for
the
form
they
had
so
*NL*
recently
seen
stalking
along
in
silent
shores
,
while
a
low
and
regular
*NL*
wash
of
the
little
waves
,
by
announcing
that
the
waters
were
not
yet
*NL*
subsided
,
furnished
a
frightful
memorial
of
the
deed
of
blood
they
had
*NL*
just
witnessed
.
Like
all
that
passing
and
gloomy
scene
,
the
low
basin
,
*NL*
however
,
quickly
melted
in
the
darkness
,
and
became
blended
with
the
*NL*
mass
of
black
objects
in
the
rear
of
the
travelers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hawkeye
soon
deviated
from
the
line
of
their
retreat
,
and
striking
off
*NL*
towards
the
mountains
which
form
the
western
boundary
of
the
narrow
*NL*
plain
,
he
led
his
followers
,
with
swift
steps
,
deep
within
the
shadows
*NL*
that
were
cast
from
their
high
and
broken
summits
.
The
route
was
now
*NL*
painful
;
lying
over
ground
ragged
with
rocks
,
and
intersected
with
*NL*
ravines
,
and
their
progress
proportionately
slow
.
Bleak
and
black
*NL*
hills
lay
on
every
side
of
them
,
compensating
in
some
degree
for
the
*NL*
additional
toil
of
the
march
by
the
sense
of
security
they
imparted
.
At
*NL*
length
the
party
began
slowly
to
rise
a
steep
and
rugged
ascent
,
by
a
*NL*
path
that
curiously
wound
among
rocks
and
trees
,
avoiding
the
one
and
*NL*
supported
by
the
other
,
in
a
manner
that
showed
it
had
been
devised
by
*NL*
men
long
practised
in
the
arts
of
the
wilderness
.
As
they
gradually
rose
*NL*
from
the
level
of
the
valleys
,
the
thick
darkness
which
usually
precedes
*NL*
the
approach
of
day
began
to
disperse
,
and
objects
were
seen
in
the
*NL*
plain
and
palpable
colors
with
which
they
had
been
gifted
by
nature
.
*NL*
When
they
issued
from
the
stunted
woods
which
clung
to
the
barren
sides
*NL*
of
the
mountain
,
upon
a
flat
and
mossy
rock
that
formed
its
summit
,
they
*NL*
met
the
morning
,
as
it
came
blushing
above
the
green
pines
of
a
hill
*NL*
that
lay
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
valley
of
the
Horican
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
scout
now
told
the
sisters
to
dismount
;
and
taking
the
bridles
from
*NL*
the
mouths
,
and
the
saddles
off
the
backs
of
the
jaded
beasts
,
he
turned
*NL*
them
loose
,
to
glean
a
scanty
subsistence
among
the
shrubs
and
meager
*NL*
herbage
of
that
elevated
region
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
,
''
he
said
,
``
and
seek
your
food
where
natur
'
gives
it
to
you
;
and
*NL*
beware
that
you
become
not
food
to
ravenous
wolves
yourselves
,
among
*NL*
these
hills
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
we
no
further
need
of
them
?
''
demanded
Heyward
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
See
,
and
judge
with
your
own
eyes
,
''
said
the
scout
,
advancing
toward
*NL*
the
eastern
brow
of
the
mountain
,
whither
he
beckoned
for
the
whole
*NL*
party
to
follow
;
``
if
it
was
as
easy
to
look
into
the
heart
of
man
as
*NL*
it
is
to
spy
out
the
nakedness
of
Montcalm
's
camp
from
this
spot
,
*NL*
hypocrites
would
grow
scarce
,
and
the
cunning
of
a
Mingo
might
prove
a
*NL*
losing
game
,
compared
to
the
honesty
of
a
Delaware
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
travelers
reached
the
verge
of
the
precipices
they
saw
,
at
*NL*
a
glance
,
the
truth
of
the
scout
's
declaration
,
and
the
admirable
*NL*
foresight
with
which
he
had
led
them
to
their
commanding
station
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
mountain
on
which
they
stood
,
elevated
perhaps
a
thousand
feet
in
*NL*
the
air
,
was
a
high
cone
that
rose
a
little
in
advance
of
that
range
*NL*
which
stretches
for
miles
along
the
western
shores
of
the
lake
,
until
*NL*
meeting
its
sisters
miles
beyond
the
water
,
it
ran
off
toward
the
*NL*
Canadas
,
in
confused
and
broken
masses
of
rock
,
thinly
sprinkled
with
*NL*
evergreens
.
Immediately
at
the
feet
of
the
party
,
the
southern
shore
*NL*
of
the
Horican
swept
in
a
broad
semicircle
from
mountain
to
mountain
,
*NL*
marking
a
wide
strand
,
that
soon
rose
into
an
uneven
and
somewhat
*NL*
elevated
plain
.
To
the
north
stretched
the
limpid
,
and
,
as
it
appeared
*NL*
from
that
dizzy
height
,
the
narrow
sheet
of
the
``
holy
lake
,
''
indented
*NL*
with
numberless
bays
,
embellished
by
fantastic
headlands
,
and
dotted
*NL*
with
countless
islands
.
At
the
distance
of
a
few
leagues
,
the
bed
of
the
*NL*
water
became
lost
among
mountains
,
or
was
wrapped
in
the
masses
of
vapor
*NL*
that
came
slowly
rolling
along
their
bosom
,
before
a
light
morning
air
.
*NL*
But
a
narrow
opening
between
the
crests
of
the
hills
pointed
out
the
*NL*
passage
by
which
they
found
their
way
still
further
north
,
to
spread
*NL*
their
pure
and
ample
sheets
again
,
before
pouring
out
their
tribute
*NL*
into
the
distant
Champlain
.
To
the
south
stretched
the
defile
,
or
rather
*NL*
broken
plain
,
so
often
mentioned
.
For
several
miles
in
this
direction
,
*NL*
the
mountains
appeared
reluctant
to
yield
their
dominion
,
but
within
*NL*
reach
of
the
eye
they
diverged
,
and
finally
melted
into
the
level
and
*NL*
sandy
lands
,
across
which
we
have
accompanied
our
adventurers
in
their
*NL*
double
journey
.
Along
both
ranges
of
hills
,
which
bounded
the
opposite
*NL*
sides
of
the
lake
and
valley
,
clouds
of
light
vapor
were
rising
in
*NL*
spiral
wreaths
from
the
uninhabited
woods
,
looking
like
the
smoke
of
*NL*
hidden
cottages
;
or
rolled
lazily
down
the
declivities
,
to
mingle
with
*NL*
the
fogs
of
the
lower
land
.
A
single
,
solitary
,
snow-white
cloud
floated
*NL*
above
the
valley
,
and
marked
the
spot
beneath
which
lay
the
silent
pool
*NL*
of
the
``
bloody
pond
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Directly
on
the
shore
of
the
lake
,
and
nearer
to
its
western
than
to
its
*NL*
eastern
margin
,
lay
the
extensive
earthen
ramparts
and
low
buildings
*NL*
of
William
Henry
.
Two
of
the
sweeping
bastions
appeared
to
rest
on
*NL*
the
water
which
washed
their
bases
,
while
a
deep
ditch
and
extensive
*NL*
morasses
guarded
its
other
sides
and
angles
.
The
land
had
been
cleared
*NL*
of
wood
for
a
reasonable
distance
around
the
work
,
but
every
other
part
*NL*
of
the
scene
lay
in
the
green
livery
of
nature
,
except
where
the
limpid
*NL*
water
mellowed
the
view
,
or
the
bold
rocks
thrust
their
black
and
naked
*NL*
heads
above
the
undulating
outline
of
the
mountain
ranges
.
In
its
front
*NL*
might
be
seen
the
scattered
sentinels
,
who
held
a
weary
watch
against
*NL*
their
numerous
foes
;
and
within
the
walls
themselves
,
the
travelers
*NL*
looked
down
upon
men
still
drowsy
with
a
night
of
vigilance
.
Toward
the
*NL*
southeast
,
but
in
immediate
contact
with
the
fort
,
was
an
entrenched
*NL*
camp
,
posted
on
a
rocky
eminence
,
that
would
have
been
far
more
eligible
*NL*
for
the
work
itself
,
in
which
Hawkeye
pointed
out
the
presence
of
*NL*
those
auxiliary
regiments
that
had
so
recently
left
the
Hudson
in
their
*NL*
company
.
From
the
woods
,
a
little
further
to
the
south
,
rose
numerous
*NL*
dark
and
lurid
smokes
,
that
were
easily
to
be
distinguished
from
the
*NL*
purer
exhalations
of
the
springs
,
and
which
the
scout
also
showed
to
*NL*
Heyward
,
as
evidences
that
the
enemy
lay
in
force
in
that
direction
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
spectacle
which
most
concerned
the
young
soldier
was
on
the
*NL*
western
bank
of
the
lake
,
though
quite
near
to
its
southern
termination
.
*NL*
On
a
strip
of
land
,
which
appeared
from
his
stand
too
narrow
to
contain
*NL*
such
an
army
,
but
which
,
in
truth
,
extended
many
hundreds
of
yards
from
*NL*
the
shores
of
the
Horican
to
the
base
of
the
mountain
,
were
to
be
seen
*NL*
the
white
tents
and
military
engines
of
an
encampment
of
ten
thousand
*NL*
men
.
Batteries
were
already
thrown
up
in
their
front
,
and
even
while
the
*NL*
spectators
above
them
were
looking
down
,
with
such
different
emotions
,
*NL*
on
a
scene
which
lay
like
a
map
beneath
their
feet
,
the
roar
of
*NL*
artillery
rose
from
the
valley
,
and
passed
off
in
thundering
echoes
*NL*
along
the
eastern
hills
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Morning
is
just
touching
them
below
,
''
said
the
deliberate
and
musing
*NL*
scout
,
``
and
the
watchers
have
a
mind
to
wake
up
the
sleepers
by
the
*NL*
sound
of
cannon
.
We
are
a
few
hours
too
late
!
Montcalm
has
already
*NL*
filled
the
woods
with
his
accursed
Iroquois
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
place
is
,
indeed
,
invested
,
''
returned
Duncan
;
``
but
is
there
no
*NL*
expedient
by
which
we
may
enter
?
capture
in
the
works
would
be
far
*NL*
preferable
to
falling
again
into
the
hands
of
roving
Indians
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
See
!
''
exclaimed
the
scout
,
unconsciously
directing
the
attention
of
*NL*
Cora
to
the
quarters
of
her
own
father
,
``
how
that
shot
has
made
the
*NL*
stones
fly
from
the
side
of
the
commandant
's
house
!
Ay
!
these
Frenchers
*NL*
will
pull
it
to
pieces
faster
than
it
was
put
together
,
solid
and
thick
*NL*
though
it
be
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Heyward
,
I
sicken
at
the
sight
of
danger
that
I
can
not
share
,
''
said
*NL*
the
undaunted
but
anxious
daughter
.
``
Let
us
go
to
Montcalm
,
and
demand
*NL*
admission
:
he
dare
not
deny
a
child
the
boon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
would
scarce
find
the
tent
of
the
Frenchman
with
the
hair
on
your
*NL*
head
''
;
said
the
blunt
scout
.
``
If
I
had
but
one
of
the
thousand
boats
*NL*
which
lie
empty
along
that
shore
,
it
might
be
done
!
Ha
!
here
will
soon
*NL*
be
an
end
of
the
firing
,
for
yonder
comes
a
fog
that
will
turn
day
to
*NL*
night
,
and
make
an
Indian
arrow
more
dangerous
than
a
molded
cannon
.
*NL*
Now
,
if
you
are
equal
to
the
work
,
and
will
follow
,
I
will
make
a
push
;
*NL*
for
I
long
to
get
down
into
that
camp
,
if
it
be
only
to
scatter
some
*NL*
Mingo
dogs
that
I
see
lurking
in
the
skirts
of
yonder
thicket
of
birch
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
equal
,
''
said
Cora
,
firmly
;
``
on
such
an
errand
we
will
follow
to
*NL*
any
danger
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
scout
turned
to
her
with
a
smile
of
honest
and
cordial
approbation
,
*NL*
as
he
answered
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
I
had
a
thousand
men
,
of
brawny
limbs
and
quick
eyes
,
that
*NL*
feared
death
as
little
as
you
!
I
'd
send
them
jabbering
Frenchers
back
*NL*
into
their
den
again
,
afore
the
week
was
ended
,
howling
like
so
many
*NL*
fettered
hounds
or
hungry
wolves
.
But
,
sir
,
''
he
added
,
turning
from
her
*NL*
to
the
rest
of
the
party
,
``
the
fog
comes
rolling
down
so
fast
,
we
shall
*NL*
have
but
just
the
time
to
meet
it
on
the
plain
,
and
use
it
as
a
cover
.
*NL*
Remember
,
if
any
accident
should
befall
me
,
to
keep
the
air
blowing
on
*NL*
your
left
cheeks
--
or
,
rather
,
follow
the
Mohicans
;
they
'd
scent
their
*NL*
way
,
be
it
in
day
or
be
it
at
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
then
waved
his
hand
for
them
to
follow
,
and
threw
himself
down
the
*NL*
steep
declivity
,
with
free
,
but
careful
footsteps
.
Heyward
assisted
*NL*
the
sisters
to
descend
,
and
in
a
few
minutes
they
were
all
far
down
a
*NL*
mountain
whose
sides
they
had
climbed
with
so
much
toil
and
pain
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
direction
taken
by
Hawkeye
soon
brought
the
travelers
to
the
level
*NL*
of
the
plain
,
nearly
opposite
to
a
sally-port
in
the
western
curtain
of
*NL*
the
fort
,
which
lay
itself
at
the
distance
of
about
half
a
mile
from
*NL*
the
point
where
he
halted
to
allow
Duncan
to
come
up
with
his
charge
.
*NL*
In
their
eagerness
,
and
favored
by
the
nature
of
the
ground
,
they
had
*NL*
anticipated
the
fog
,
which
was
rolling
heavily
down
the
lake
,
and
it
*NL*
became
necessary
to
pause
,
until
the
mists
had
wrapped
the
camp
of
the
*NL*
enemy
in
their
fleecy
mantle
.
The
Mohicans
profited
by
the
delay
,
to
*NL*
steal
out
of
the
woods
,
and
to
make
a
survey
of
surrounding
objects
.
*NL*
They
were
followed
at
a
little
distance
by
the
scout
,
with
a
view
to
*NL*
profit
early
by
their
report
,
and
to
obtain
some
faint
knowledge
for
*NL*
himself
of
the
more
immediate
localities
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
very
few
moments
he
returned
,
his
face
reddened
with
vexation
,
*NL*
while
he
muttered
his
disappointment
in
words
of
no
very
gentle
import
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
has
the
cunning
Frenchman
been
posting
a
picket
directly
in
our
*NL*
path
,
''
he
said
;
``
red-skins
and
whites
;
and
we
shall
be
as
likely
to
fall
*NL*
into
their
midst
as
to
pass
them
in
the
fog
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
not
we
make
a
circuit
to
avoid
the
danger
,
''
asked
Heyward
,
``
and
come
*NL*
into
our
path
again
when
it
is
passed
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
that
once
bends
from
the
line
of
his
march
in
a
fog
can
tell
when
*NL*
or
how
to
find
it
again
!
The
mists
of
Horican
are
not
like
the
curls
*NL*
from
a
peace-pipe
,
or
the
smoke
which
settles
above
a
mosquito
fire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
yet
speaking
,
when
a
crashing
sound
was
heard
,
and
a
cannon-ball
*NL*
entered
the
thicket
,
striking
the
body
of
a
sapling
,
and
rebounding
to
*NL*
the
earth
,
its
force
being
much
expended
by
previous
resistance
.
*NL*
The
Indians
followed
instantly
like
busy
attendants
on
the
terrible
*NL*
messenger
,
and
Uncas
commenced
speaking
earnestly
and
with
much
action
,
*NL*
in
the
Delaware
tongue
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
may
be
so
,
lad
,
''
muttered
the
scout
,
when
he
had
ended
;
``
for
*NL*
desperate
fevers
are
not
to
be
treated
like
a
toothache
.
Come
,
then
,
the
*NL*
fog
is
shutting
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stop
!
''
cried
Heyward
;
``
first
explain
your
expectations
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
soon
done
,
and
a
small
hope
it
is
;
but
it
is
better
than
nothing
.
*NL*
This
shot
that
you
see
,
''
added
the
scout
,
kicking
the
harmless
iron
with
*NL*
his
foot
,
``
has
plowed
the
`
arth
in
its
road
from
the
fort
,
and
we
shall
*NL*
hunt
for
the
furrow
it
has
made
,
when
all
other
signs
may
fail
.
No
more
*NL*
words
,
but
follow
,
or
the
fog
may
leave
us
in
the
middle
of
our
path
,
a
*NL*
mark
for
both
armies
to
shoot
at
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Heyward
perceiving
that
,
in
fact
,
a
crisis
had
arrived
,
when
acts
were
*NL*
more
required
than
words
,
placed
himself
between
the
sisters
,
and
drew
*NL*
them
swiftly
forward
,
keeping
the
dim
figure
of
their
leader
in
his
eye
.
*NL*
It
was
soon
apparent
that
Hawkeye
had
not
magnified
the
power
of
the
*NL*
fog
,
for
before
they
had
proceeded
twenty
yards
,
it
was
difficult
for
*NL*
the
different
individuals
of
the
party
to
distinguish
each
other
in
the
*NL*
vapor
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
made
their
little
circuit
to
the
left
,
and
were
already
*NL*
inclining
again
toward
the
right
,
having
,
as
Heyward
thought
,
got
over
*NL*
nearly
half
the
distance
to
the
friendly
works
,
when
his
ears
were
*NL*
saluted
with
the
fierce
summons
,
apparently
within
twenty
feet
of
them
,
*NL*
of
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Qui
va
la
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Push
on
!
''
whispered
the
scout
,
once
more
bending
to
the
left
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Push
on
!
''
repeated
Heyward
;
when
the
summons
was
renewed
by
a
dozen
*NL*
voices
,
each
of
which
seemed
charged
with
menace
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
C'est
moi
,
''
cried
Duncan
,
dragging
rather
than
leading
those
he
*NL*
supported
swiftly
onward
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bete
!
--
qui
?
--
moi
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ami
de
la
France
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tu

`
as
plus
l'air
d'un
ennemi
de
la
France
;
arrete
ou
pardieu
je
te
*NL*
ferai
ami
du
diable
.
Non
!
feu
,
camarades
,
feu
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
order
was
instantly
obeyed
,
and
the
fog
was
stirred
by
the
explosion
*NL*
of
fifty
muskets
.
Happily
,
the
aim
was
bad
,
and
the
bullets
cut
the
*NL*
air
in
a
direction
a
little
different
from
that
taken
by
the
fugitives
;
*NL*
though
still
so
nigh
them
,
that
to
the
unpractised
ears
of
David
and
the
*NL*
two
females
,
it
appeared
as
if
they
whistled
within
a
few
inches
of
the
*NL*
organs
.
The
outcry
was
renewed
,
and
the
order
,
not
only
to
fire
again
,
*NL*
but
to
pursue
,
was
too
plainly
audible
.
When
Heyward
briefly
explained
*NL*
the
meaning
of
the
words
they
heard
,
Hawkeye
halted
and
spoke
with
quick
*NL*
decision
and
great
firmness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
deliver
our
fire
,
''
he
said
;
``
they
will
believe
it
a
sortie
,
and
*NL*
give
way
,
or
they
will
wait
for
reinforcements
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
scheme
was
well
conceived
,
but
failed
in
its
effects
.
The
instant
*NL*
the
French
heard
the
pieces
,
it
seemed
as
if
the
plain
was
alive
with
*NL*
men
,
muskets
rattling
along
its
whole
extent
,
from
the
shores
of
the
*NL*
lake
to
the
furthest
boundary
of
the
woods
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
shall
draw
their
entire
army
upon
us
,
and
bring
on
a
general
*NL*
assault
,
''
said
Duncan
:
``
lead
on
,
my
friend
,
for
your
own
life
and
ours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
scout
seemed
willing
to
comply
;
but
,
in
the
hurry
of
the
moment
,
and
*NL*
in
the
change
of
position
,
he
had
lost
the
direction
.
In
vain
he
turned
*NL*
either
cheek
toward
the
light
air
;
they
felt
equally
cool
.
In
this
*NL*
dilemma
,
Uncas
lighted
on
the
furrow
of
the
cannon
ball
,
where
it
had
*NL*
cut
the
ground
in
three
adjacent
ant-hills
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
me
the
range
!
''
said
Hawkeye
,
bending
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
*NL*
direction
,
and
then
instantly
moving
onward
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cries
,
oaths
,
voices
calling
to
each
other
,
and
the
reports
of
muskets
,
*NL*
were
now
quick
and
incessant
,
and
,
apparently
,
on
every
side
of
them
.
*NL*
Suddenly
a
strong
glare
of
light
flashed
across
the
scene
,
the
fog
*NL*
rolled
upward
in
thick
wreaths
,
and
several
cannons
belched
across
the
*NL*
plain
,
and
the
roar
was
thrown
heavily
back
from
the
bellowing
echoes
of
*NL*
the
mountain
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
from
the
fort
!
''
exclaimed
Hawkeye
,
turning
short
on
his
tracks
;
*NL*
``
and
we
,
like
stricken
fools
,
were
rushing
to
the
woods
,
under
the
very
*NL*
knives
of
the
Maquas
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
instant
their
mistake
was
rectified
,
the
whole
party
retraced
the
*NL*
error
with
the
utmost
diligence
.
Duncan
willingly
relinquished
the
*NL*
support
of
Cora
to
the
arm
of
Uncas
and
Cora
as
readily
accepted
the
*NL*
welcome
assistance
.
Men
,
hot
and
angry
in
pursuit
,
were
evidently
on
*NL*
their
footsteps
,
and
each
instant
threatened
their
capture
,
if
not
their
*NL*
destruction
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Point
de
quartier
aux
coquins
!
''
cried
an
eager
pursuer
,
who
seemed
to
*NL*
direct
the
operations
of
the
enemy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stand
firm
,
and
be
ready
,
my
gallant
Sixtieths
!
''
suddenly
exclaimed
*NL*
a
voice
above
them
;
``
wait
to
see
the
enemy
,
fire
low
and
sweep

``

shouted
the

speaker
,
in
the
awful
tones
of
parental
*NL*
agony
,
the
sound
reaching
even
to
the
woods
,
and
rolling
back
in
solemn
*NL*
echo
.
''
'T

Duncan
heard
the
grating
of
the
rusty
hinges
,
and
darting
to
the
spot
,
*NL*
directed
by
the
sound
,
he
met
a
long
line
of
dark
red
warriors
,
passing
*NL*
swiftly
toward
the
glacis
.
He
knew
them
for
his
own
battalion
of
the
*NL*
Royal
Americans
,
and
flying
to
their
head
,
soon
swept
every
trace
of
his
*NL*
pursuers
from
before
the
works
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
an
instant
,
Cora
and
Alice
had
stood
trembling
and
bewildered
by
*NL*
this
unexpected
desertion
;
but
before
either
had
leisure
for
speech
,
or
*NL*
even
thought
,
an
officer
of
gigantic
frame
,
whose
locks
were
bleached
*NL*
with
years
and
service
,
but
whose
air
of
military
grandeur
had
been
*NL*
rather
softened
than
destroyed
by
time
,
rushed
out
of
the
body
of
mist
,
*NL*
and
folded
them
to
his
bosom
,
while
large
scalding
tears
rolled
down
his
*NL*
pale
and
wrinkled
cheeks
,
and
he
exclaimed
,
in
the
peculiar
accent
of
*NL*
Scotland
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
this
I
thank
thee

Lord
!
Let

*NL*
*NL*
A
few
succeeding
days
were
passed
amid
the
privations
,
the
uproar
,
*NL*
and
the
dangers
of
the
siege
,
which
was
vigorously
pressed
by
a
*NL*
power
,
against
whose
approaches
Munro
possessed
no
competent
means
of
*NL*
resistance
.
It
appeared
as
if
Webb
,
with
his
army
,
which
lay
slumbering
*NL*
on
the
banks
of
the
Hudson
,
had
utterly
forgotten
the
strait
to
which
*NL*
his
countrymen
were
reduced
.
Montcalm
had
filled
the
woods
of
the
*NL*
portage
with
his
savages
,
every
yell
and
whoop
from
whom
rang
through
*NL*
the
British
encampment
,
chilling
the
hearts
of
men
who
were
already
but
*NL*
too
much
disposed
to
magnify
the
danger
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
so
,
however
,
with
the
besieged
.
Animated
by
the
words
,
and
*NL*
stimulated
by
the
examples
of
their
leaders
,
they
had
found
their
*NL*
courage
,
and
maintained
their
ancient
reputation
,
with
a
zeal
that
did
*NL*
justice
to
the
stern
character
of
their
commander
.
As
if
satisfied
with
*NL*
the
toil
of
marching
through
the
wilderness
to
encounter
his
enemy
,
the
*NL*
French
general
,
though
of
approved
skill
,
had
neglected
to
seize
the
*NL*
adjacent
mountains
;
whence
the
besieged
might
have
been
exterminated
*NL*
with
impunity
,
and
which
,
in
the
more
modern
warfare
of
the
country
,
*NL*
would
not
have
been
neglected
for
a
single
hour
.
This
sort
of
contempt
*NL*
for
eminences
,
or
rather
dread
of
the
labor
of
ascending
them
,
might
*NL*
have
been
termed
the
besetting
weakness
of
the
warfare
of
the
period
.
It
*NL*
originated
in
the
simplicity
of
the
Indian
contests
,
in
which
,
from
the
*NL*
nature
of
the
combats
,
and
the
density
of
the
forests
,
fortresses
were
*NL*
rare
,
and
artillery
next
to
useless
.
The
carelessness
engendered
by
*NL*
these
usages
descended
even
to
the
war
of
the
Revolution
and
lost
the
*NL*
States
the
important
fortress
of
Ticonderoga
opening
a
way
for
the
army
*NL*
of
Burgoyne
into
what
was
then
the
bosom
of
the
country
.
We
look
back
at
*NL*
this
ignorance
,
or
infatuation
,
whichever
it
may
be
called
,
with
wonder
,
*NL*
knowing
that
the
neglect
of
an
eminence
,
whose
difficulties
,
like
those
*NL*
of
Mount
Defiance
,
have
been
so
greatly
exaggerated
,
would
,
at
the
*NL*
present
time
,
prove
fatal
to
the
reputation
of
the
engineer
who
had
*NL*
planned
the
works
at
their
base
,
or
to
that
of
the
general
whose
lot
it
*NL*
was
to
defend
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
tourist
,
the
valetudinarian
,
or
the
amateur
of
the
beauties
of
*NL*
nature
,
who
,
in
the
train
of
his
four-in-hand
,
now
rolls
through
the
*NL*
scenes
we
have
attempted
to
describe
,
in
quest
of
information
,
health
,
*NL*
or
pleasure
,
or
floats
steadily
toward
his
object
on
those
artificial
*NL*
waters
which
have
sprung
up
under
the
administration
of
a
statesman
*
who
*NL*
has
dared
to
stake
his
political
character
on
the
hazardous
issue
,
is
*NL*
not
to
suppose
that
his
ancestors
traversed
those
hills
,
or
struggled
*NL*
with
the
same
currents
with
equal
facility
.
The
transportation
of
a
*NL*
single
heavy
gun
was
often
considered
equal
to
a
victory
gained
;
if
*NL*
happily
,
the
difficulties
of
the
passage
had
not
so
far
separated
it
*NL*
from
its
necessary
concomitant
,
the
ammunition
,
as
to
render
it
no
more
*NL*
than
a
useless
tube
of
unwieldy
iron
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
Evidently
the
late
De
Witt
Clinton
,
who
died
governor
of
*NL*
New
York
in
1828
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
evils
of
this
state
of
things
pressed
heavily
on
the
fortunes
of
the
*NL*
resolute
Scotsman
who
now
defended
William
Henry
.
Though
his
adversary
*NL*
neglected
the
hills
,
he
had
planted
his
batteries
with
judgment
on
the
*NL*
plain
,
and
caused
them
to
be
served
with
vigor
and
skill
.
Against
*NL*
this
assault
,
the
besieged
could
only
oppose
the
imperfect
and
hasty
*NL*
preparations
of
a
fortress
in
the
wilderness
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
in
the
afternoon
of
the
fifth
day
of
the
siege
,
and
the
fourth
of
*NL*
his
own
service
in
it
,
that
Major
Heyward
profited
by
a
parley
that
*NL*
had
just
been
beaten
,
by
repairing
to
the
ramparts
of
one
of
the
water
*NL*
bastions
,
to
breathe
the
cool
air
from
the
lake
,
and
to
take
a
survey
*NL*
of
the
progress
of
the
siege
.
He
was
alone
,
if
the
solitary
sentinel
who
*NL*
paced
the
mound
be
excepted
;
for
the
artillerists
had
hastened
also
to
*NL*
profit
by
the
temporary
suspension
of
their
arduous
duties
.
The
evening
*NL*
was
delightfully
calm
,
and
the
light
air
from
the
limpid
water
fresh
and
*NL*
soothing
.
It
seemed
as
if
,
with
the
termination
of
the
roar
of
artillery
*NL*
and
the
plunging
of
shot
,
nature
had
also
seized
the
moment
to
assume
*NL*
her
mildest
and
most
captivating
form
.
The
sun
poured
down
his
parting
*NL*
glory
on
the
scene
,
without
the
oppression
of
those
fierce
rays
that
*NL*
belong
to
the
climate
and
the
season
.
The
mountains
looked
green
,
*NL*
and
fresh
,
and
lovely
,
tempered
with
the
milder
light
,
or
softened
in
*NL*
shadow
,
as
thin
vapors
floated
between
them
and
the
sun
.
The
numerous
*NL*
islands
rested
on
the
bosom
of
the
Horican
,
some
low
and
sunken
,
as
if
*NL*
embedded
in
the
waters
,
and
others
appearing
to
hover
about
the
element
,
*NL*
in
little
hillocks
of
green
velvet
;
among
which
the
fishermen
of
the
*NL*
beleaguering
army
peacefully
rowed
their
skiffs
,
or
floated
at
rest
on
*NL*
the
glassy
mirror
in
quiet
pursuit
of
their
employment
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
scene
was
at
once
animated
and
still
.
All
that
pertained
to
nature
*NL*
was
sweet
,
or
simply
grand
;
while
those
parts
which
depended
on
the
*NL*
temper
and
movements
of
man
were
lively
and
playful
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
little
spotless
flags
were
abroad
,
the
one
on
a
salient
angle
of
the
*NL*
fort
,
and
the
other
on
the
advanced
battery
of
the
besiegers
;
emblems
of
*NL*
the
truth
which
existed
,
not
only
to
the
acts
,
but
it
would
seem
,
also
,
*NL*
to
the
enmity
of
the
combatants
.
*NL*
*NL*
Behind
these
again
swung
,
heavily
opening
and
closing
in
silken
folds
,
*NL*
the
rival
standards
of
England
and
France
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
hundred
gay
and
thoughtless
young
Frenchmen
were
drawing
a
net
to
the
*NL*
pebbly
beach
,
within
dangerous
proximity
to
the
sullen
but
silent
cannon
*NL*
of
the
fort
,
while
the
eastern
mountain
was
sending
back
the
loud
shouts
*NL*
and
gay
merriment
that
attended
their
sport
.
Some
were
rushing
eagerly
*NL*
to
enjoy
the
aquatic
games
of
the
lake
,
and
others
were
already
toiling
*NL*
their
way
up
the
neighboring
hills
,
with
the
restless
curiosity
of
their
*NL*
nation
.
To
all
these
sports
and
pursuits
,
those
of
the
enemy
who
watched
*NL*
the
besieged
,
and
the
besieged
themselves
,
were
,
however
,
merely
the
*NL*
idle
though
sympathizing
spectators
.
Here
and
there
a
picket
had
,
*NL*
indeed
,
raised
a
song
,
or
mingled
in
a
dance
,
which
had
drawn
the
*NL*
dusky
savages
around
them
,
from
their
lairs
in
the
forest
.
In
short
,
*NL*
everything
wore
rather
the
appearance
of
a
day
of
pleasure
,
than
of
*NL*
an
hour
stolen
from
the
dangers
and
toil
of
a
bloody
and
vindictive
*NL*
warfare
.
*NL*
*NL*
Duncan
had
stood
in
a
musing
attitude
,
contemplating
this
scene
a
few
*NL*
minutes
,
when
his
eyes
were
directed
to
the
glacis
in
front
of
the
*NL*
sally-port
already
mentioned
,
by
the
sounds
of
approaching
footsteps
.
He
*NL*
walked
to
an
angle
of
the
bastion
,
and
beheld
the
scout
advancing
,
*NL*
under
the
custody
of
a
French
officer
,
to
the
body
of
the
fort
.
The
*NL*
countenance
of
Hawkeye
was
haggard
and
careworn
,
and
his
air
dejected
,
*NL*
as
though
he
felt
the
deepest
degradation
at
having
fallen
into
the
*NL*
power
of
his
enemies
.
He
was
without
his
favorite
weapon
,
and
his
arms
*NL*
were
even
bound
behind
him
with
thongs
,
made
of
the
skin
of
a
deer
.
The
*NL*
arrival
of
flags
to
cover
the
messengers
of
summons
,
had
occurred
so
*NL*
often
of
late
,
that
when
Heyward
first
threw
his
careless
glance
on
this
*NL*
group
,
he
expected
to
see
another
of
the
officers
of
the
enemy
,
charged
*NL*
with
a
similar
office
but
the
instant
he
recognized
the
tall
person
and
*NL*
still
sturdy
though
downcast
features
of
his
friend
,
the
woodsman
,
he
*NL*
started
with
surprise
,
and
turned
to
descend
from
the
bastion
into
the
*NL*
bosom
of
the
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sounds
of
other
voices
,
however
,
caught
his
attention
,
and
for
a
*NL*
moment
caused
him
to
forget
his
purpose
.
At
the
inner
angle
of
the
mound
*NL*
he
met
the
sisters
,
walking
along
the
parapet
,
in
search
,
like
himself
,
*NL*
of
air
and
relief
from
confinement
.
They
had
not
met
from
that
painful
*NL*
moment
when
he
deserted
them
on
the
plain
,
only
to
assure
their
safety
.
*NL*
He
had
parted
from
them
worn
with
care
,
and
jaded
with
fatigue
;
he
now
*NL*
saw
them
refreshed
and
blooming
,
though
timid
and
anxious
.
Under
such
an
*NL*
inducement
it
will
cause
no
surprise
that
the
young
man
lost
sight
for
*NL*
a
time
,
of
other
objects
in
order
to
address
them
.
He
was
,
however
,
*NL*
anticipated
by
the
voice
of
the
ingenuous
and
youthful
Alice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
thou
tyrant
!
thou
recreant
knight
!
he
who
abandons
his
damsels
*NL*
in
the
very
lists
,
''
she
cried
;
``
here
have
we
been
days
,
nay
,
ages
,
*NL*
expecting
you
at
our
feet
,
imploring
mercy
and
forgetfulness
of
your
*NL*
craven
backsliding
,
or
I
should
rather
say
,
backrunning
--
for
verily
you
*NL*
fled
in
the
manner
that
no
stricken
deer
,
as
our
worthy
friend
the
scout
*NL*
would
say
,
could
equal
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
that
Alice
means
our
thanks
and
our
blessings
,
''
added
the
*NL*
graver
and
more
thoughtful
Cora
.
``
In
truth
,
we
have
a
little
wonder
why
*NL*
you
should
so
rigidly
absent
yourself
from
a
place
where
the
gratitude
*NL*
of
the
daughters
might
receive
the
support
of
a
parent
's
thanks
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
father
himself
could
tell
you
,
that
,
though
absent
from
your
*NL*
presence
,
I
have
not
been
altogether
forgetful
of
your
safety
,
''
returned
*NL*
the
young
man
;
``
the
mastery
of
yonder
village
of
huts
,
''
pointing
to
the
*NL*
neighboring
entrenched
camp
,
``
has
been
keenly
disputed
;
and
he
who
holds
*NL*
it
is
sure
to
be
possessed
of
this
fort
,
and
that
which
it
contains
.
My
*NL*
days
and
nights
have
all
been
passed
there
since
we
separated
,
because
*NL*
I
thought
that
duty
called
me
thither
.
But
,
''
he
added
,
with
an
air
of
*NL*
chagrin
,
which
he
endeavored
,
though
unsuccessfully
,
to
conceal
,
``
had
*NL*
I
been
aware
that
what
I
then
believed
a
soldier
's
conduct
could
be
so
*NL*
construed
,
shame
would
have
been
added
to
the
list
of
reasons
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Heyward
!
Duncan
!
''
exclaimed
Alice
,
bending
forward
to
read
his
*NL*
half-averted
countenance
,
until
a
lock
of
her
golden
hair
rested
on
her
*NL*
flushed
cheek
,
and
nearly
concealed
the
tear
that
had
started
to
her
*NL*
eye
;
``
did
I
think
this
idle
tongue
of
mine
had
pained
you
,
I
would
*NL*
silence
it
forever
.
Cora
can
say
,
if
Cora
would
,
how
justly
we
have
*NL*
prized
your
services
,
and
how
deep
--
I
had
almost
said
,
how
fervent
--
is
*NL*
our
gratitude
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
will
Cora
attest
the
truth
of
this
?
''
cried
Duncan
,
suffering
the
*NL*
cloud
to
be
chased
from
his
countenance
by
a
smile
of
open
pleasure
.
*NL*
``
What
says
our
graver
sister
?
Will
she
find
an
excuse
for
the
neglect
of
*NL*
the
knight
in
the
duty
of
a
soldier
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Cora
made
no
immediate
answer
,
but
turned
her
face
toward
the
water
,
as
*NL*
if
looking
on
the
sheet
of
the
Horican
.
When
she
did
bend
her
dark
eyes
*NL*
on
the
young
man
,
they
were
yet
filled
with
an
expression
of
anguish
*NL*
that
at
once
drove
every
thought
but
that
of
kind
solicitude
from
his
*NL*
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
not
well
,
dearest
Miss
Munro
!
''
he
exclaimed
;
``
we
have
trifled
*NL*
while
you
are
in
suffering
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
nothing
,
''
she
answered
,
refusing
his
support
with
feminine
*NL*
reserve
.
``
That
I
can
not
see
the
sunny
side
of
the
picture
of
life
,
like
*NL*
this
artless
but
ardent
enthusiast
,
''
she
added
,
laying
her
hand
lightly
,
*NL*
but
affectionately
,
on
the
arm
of
her
sister
,
``
is
the
penalty
of
*NL*
experience
,
and
,
perhaps
,
the
misfortune
of
my
nature
.
See
,
''
she
*NL*
continued
,
as
if
determined
to
shake
off
infirmity
,
in
a
sense
of
duty
;
*NL*
``
look
around
you
,
Major
Heyward
,
and
tell
me
what
a
prospect
is
this
for
*NL*
the
daughter
of
a
soldier
whose
greatest
happiness
is
his
honor
and
his
*NL*
military
renown
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Neither
ought
nor
shall
be
tarnished
by
circumstances
over
which
he
has
*NL*
had
no
control
,
''
Duncan
warmly
replied
.
``
But
your
words
recall
me
to
my
*NL*
own
duty
.
I
go
now
to
your
gallant
father
,
to
hear
his
determination
*NL*
in
matters
of
the
last
moment
to
the
defense
.
God
bless
you
in
every
*NL*
fortune
,
noble
--
Cora
--
I
may
and
must
call
you
.
''
She
frankly
gave
him
her
*NL*
hand
,
though
her
lip
quivered
,
and
her
cheeks
gradually
became
of
ashly
*NL*
paleness
.
``
In
every
fortune
,
I
know
you
will
be
an
ornament
and
honor
*NL*
to
your
sex

Alice
,
adieu
''
--
his
voice
changed
from
admiration
to
*NL*
tenderness
--
``
adieu
,
Alice
;
we
shall
soon
meet
again
;
as
conquerors
,
I
*NL*
trust
,
and
amid
rejoicings
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Without
waiting
for
an
answer
from
either
,
the
young
man
threw
himself
*NL*
down
the
grassy
steps
of
the
bastion
,
and
moving
rapidly
across
the
*NL*
parade
,
he
was
quickly
in
the
presence
of
their
father
.
Munro
was
pacing
*NL*
his
narrow
apartment
with
a
disturbed
air
and
gigantic
strides
as
Duncan
*NL*
entered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
anticipated
my
wishes
,
Major
Heyward
,
''
he
said
;
``
I
was
about
*NL*
to
request
this
favor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sorry
to
see
,
sir
,
that
the
messenger
I
so
warmly
recommended
has
*NL*
returned
in
custody
of
the
French
!
I
hope
there
is
no
reason
to
distrust
*NL*
his
fidelity
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
fidelity
of
`
The
Long
Rifle

is
well
known
to
me

''
returned
Munro
,
*NL*
``
and
is
above
suspicion
;

his
usual
good
fortune
seems

at
last
,
*NL*
to
have
failed

Montcalm
has
got
him
,
and
with
the
accursed
politeness
*NL*
of
his
nation
,
he
has
sent
him
in
with
a
doleful
tale
,
of
`
knowing
how
*NL*
I
valued
the
fellow

he
could
not
think
of
retaining
him

A
Jesuitical

of
telling
a
man
of
his
misfortunes

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
the
general

his
succor

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
ye
look
to
the
south
as
ye
entered
,
and
could
ye
not
see
them

*NL*
said
the
old
soldier
,
laughing
bitterly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hoot
!
hoot
!
you
're
an
impatient
boy

can
not

*NL*
*NL*
``
They

When

*NL*
There
is
a
letter

it
would
seem

too
;

that
is
the
only
agreeable
*NL*
part
of
the
matter
.
For
the
customary
attentions
of
your
Marquis

Montcalm

I
warrant
me
,
Duncan
,
that
he
of
Lothian
would
buy
a
dozen
*NL*
such
marquisates
--
but
if
the
news
of
the
letter
were
bad
,
the
gentility
*NL*
of
this
French
monsieur
would
certainly
compel
him
to
let
us
know
it

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
says
the

he
make

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

The
whole

is
this

*NL*
``
But

no

*NL*
``
There
were
the
morning

provincial
loons

know

you

half
a

one

dropped
his
powder
over

coals

just
burned

''
Then
,
suddenly
changing
his
bitter
,
*NL*
ironical
manner
,
to
one
more
grave
and
thoughtful
,
he
continued
:
``

*NL*

something
in

it
would
be

well

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Our
decision
should
be
speedy

''
said
Duncan
,
gladly
availing
himself
*NL*
of
this
change
of
humor
,
to
press
the
more
important
objects
of
their
*NL*
interview
;
``
I
can
not
conceal
from
you
,
sir

that
the
camp
will
not
be
*NL*
much
longer
tenable

and
I
am
sorry
to
add
,
that
things
appear
no
better
*NL*
in
the
fort
;
more
than
half
the
guns
are
bursted
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
should
it
be
otherwise
?
Some
were
fished
from
the
bottom
of
*NL*
the
lake
;
some
have
been
rusting
in
woods
since
the
discovery
of
*NL*
the
country
;
and
some
were
never
guns
at
all
--
mere
privateersmen
's
*NL*
playthings
!
Do
you
think
,
sir
,
you
can
have
Woolwich
Warren
in
the
midst
*NL*
of
a
wilderness
,
three
thousand
miles
from
Great
Britain
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
walls
are
crumbling
about
our
ears
,
and
provisions
begin
to
fail
*NL*
us
,
''
continued
Heyward
,
without
regarding
the
new
burst
of
indignation
;
*NL*
``
even
the
men
show
signs
of
discontent
and
alarm
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Major
Heyward
,
''
said
Munro
,
turning
to
his
youthful
associate
with
*NL*
the
dignity
of
his
years
and
superior
rank
;
``
I
should
have
served
his
*NL*
majesty
for
half
a
century
,
and
earned
these
gray
hairs
in
vain
,
were
*NL*
I
ignorant
of
all
you
say
,
and
of
the
pressing
nature
of
our
*NL*
circumstances
;
still
,
there
is
everything
due
to
the
honor
of
the
king
's
*NL*
arms
,
and
something
to
ourselves
.
While
there
is
hope
of
succor
,
this
*NL*
fortress
will
I
defend
,
though
it
be
to
be
done
with
pebbles
gathered
*NL*
on
the
lake
shore
.
It
is
a
sight
of
the
letter
,
therefore
,
that
we
want
,
*NL*
that
we
may
know
the
intentions
of
the
man
the
earl
of
Loudon
has
left
*NL*
among
us
as
his
substitute

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
can
I
be
of
service
in
the
matter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
,
you
can
;
the
marquis
of
Montcalm
has
,
in
addition
to
his
other
*NL*
civilities
,
invited
me
to
a
personal
interview
between
the
works
and
his
*NL*
own
camp
;
in
order
,
as
he
says
,
to
impart
some
additional
information
.
*NL*
Now
,
I
think
it
would
not
be
wise
to
show
any
undue
solicitude
to
meet
*NL*
him
,
and
I
would
employ
you
,
an
officer
of
rank
,
as
my
substitute
;
for
*NL*
it
would
but
ill
comport
with
the
honor
of
Scotland
to
let
it
be
said
*NL*
one
of
her
gentlemen
was
outdone
in
civility
by
a
native
of
any
other
*NL*
country
on
earth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Without
assuming
the
supererogatory
task
of
entering
into
a
discussion
*NL*
of
the
comparative
merits
of
national
courtesy
,
Duncan
cheerfully
*NL*
assented
to
supply
the
place
of
the
veteran
in
the
approaching
*NL*
interview
.
A
long
and
confidential
communication
now
succeeded
,
during
*NL*
which
the
young
man
received
some
additional
insight
into
his
duty
,
*NL*
from
the
experience
and
native
acuteness
of
his
commander
,
and
then
the
*NL*
former
took
his
leave
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
Duncan
could
only
act
as
the
representative
of
the
commandant
of
the
*NL*
fort
,
the
ceremonies
which
should
have
accompanied
a
meeting
between
the
*NL*
heads
of
the
adverse
forces
were
,
of
course
,
dispensed
with
.
The
truce
*NL*
still
existed
,
and
with
a
roll
and
beat
of
the
drum
,
and
covered
by
a
*NL*
little
white
flag
,
Duncan
left
the
sally-port
,
within
ten
minutes
after
*NL*
his
instructions
were
ended
.
He
was
received
by
the
French
officer
in
*NL*
advance
with
the
usual
formalities
,
and
immediately
accompanied
to
a
*NL*
distant
marquee
of
the
renowned
soldier
who
led
the
forces
of
France
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
general
of
the
enemy
received
the
youthful
messenger
,
surrounded
by
*NL*
his
principal
officers
,
and
by
a
swarthy
band
of
the
native
chiefs
,
*NL*
who
had
followed
him
to
the
field
,
with
the
warriors
of
their
several
*NL*
tribes
.
Heyward
paused
short
,
when
,
in
glancing
his
eyes
rapidly
over
*NL*
the
dark
group
of
the
latter
,
he
beheld
the
malignant
countenance
of
*NL*
Magua
,
regarding
him
with
the
calm
but
sullen
attention
which
marked
the
*NL*
expression
of
that
subtle
savage
.
A
slight
exclamation
of
surprise
even
*NL*
burst
from
the
lips
of
the
young
man
,
but
instantly
,
recollecting
*NL*
his
errand
,
and
the
presence
in
which
he
stood
,
he
suppressed
every
*NL*
appearance
of
emotion
,
and
turned
to
the
hostile
leader
,
who
had
already
*NL*
advanced
a
step
to
receive
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
marquis
of
Montcalm
was
,
at
the
period
of
which
we
write
,
in
the
*NL*
flower
of
his
age
,
and
,
it
may
be
added
,
in
the
zenith
of
his
fortunes
.
*NL*
But
even
in
that
enviable
situation
,
he
was
affable
,
and
distinguished
*NL*
as
much
for
his
attention
to
the
forms
of
courtesy
,
as
for
that
*NL*
chivalrous
courage
which
,
only
two
short
years
afterward
,
induced
him
*NL*
to
throw
away
his
life
on
the
plains
of
Abraham
.
Duncan
,
in
turning
his
*NL*
eyes
from
the
malign
expression
of
Magua
,
suffered
them
to
rest
with
*NL*
pleasure
on
the
smiling
and
polished
features
,
and
the
noble
military
*NL*
air
,
of
the
French
general
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
,
''
said
the
latter
,
``
j'
ai
beaucoup
de
plaisir
a
--
bah
!
--
ou
est
*NL*
cet
interprete
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Je
crois
,
monsieur
,
qu'il
ne
sear
pas
necessaire

''
Heyward
modestly
*NL*
replied
;
``
je
parle
un
peu
francais
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
j'
en
suis
bien
aise
,
''
said
Montcalm
,
taking
Duncan
familiarly
by
*NL*
the
arm
,
and
leading
him
deep
into
the
marquee
,
a
little
out
of
earshot
;
*NL*
``
je
deteste
ces
fripons-la
;
on
ne
sait
jamais
sur
quel
pie
on
est
avec
*NL*
eux
.
Eh
,
bien
!
monsieur
,
''
he
continued
still
speaking
in
French
;
``
though
*NL*
I
should
have
been
proud
of
receiving
your
commandant
,
I
am
very
happy
*NL*
that
he
has
seen
proper
to
employ
an
officer
so
distinguished
,
and
who
,
*NL*
I
am
sure
,
is
so
amiable
,
as
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Duncan
bowed
low
,
pleased
with
the
compliment
,
in
spite
of
a
most
heroic
*NL*
determination
to
suffer
no
artifice
to
allure
him
into
forgetfulness
of
*NL*
the
interest
of
his
prince
;
and
Montcalm
,
after
a
pause
of
a
moment
,
as
*NL*
if
to
collect
his
thoughts
,
proceeded
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
commandant
is
a
brave
man
,
and
well
qualified
to
repel
my
*NL*
assault
.
Mais
,
monsieur
,
is
it
not
time
to
begin
to
take
more
counsel
*NL*
of
humanity
,
and
less
of
your
courage
?
The
one
as
strongly
characterizes
*NL*
the
hero
as
the
other
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
consider
the
qualities
as
inseparable
,
''
returned
Duncan
,
smiling
;
*NL*
``
but
while
we
find
in
the
vigor
of
your
excellency
every
motive
to
*NL*
stimulate
the
one
,
we
can
,
as
yet
,
see
no
particular
call
for
the
*NL*
exercise
of
the
other
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Montcalm
,
in
his
turn
,
slightly
bowed
,
but
it
was
with
the
air
of
a
*NL*
man
too
practised
to
remember
the
language
of
flattery
.
After
musing
a
*NL*
moment
,
he
added
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
possible
my
glasses
have
deceived
me
,
and
that
your
works
resist
*NL*
our
cannon
better
than
I
had
supposed
.
You
know
our
force
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Our
accounts
vary
,
''
said
Duncan
,
carelessly
;
``
the
highest
,
however
,
has
*NL*
not
exceeded
twenty
thousand
men
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Frenchman
bit
his
lip
,
and
fastened
his
eyes
keenly
on
the
other
as
*NL*
if
to
read
his
thoughts
;
then
,
with
a
readiness
peculiar
to
himself
,
he
*NL*
continued
,
as
if
assenting
to
the
truth
of
an
enumeration
which
quite
*NL*
doubled
his
army
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
poor
compliment
to
the
vigilance
of
us
soldiers
,
monsieur
,
*NL*
that
,
do
what
we
will
,
we
never
can
conceal
our
numbers
.
If
it
were
*NL*
to
be
done
at
all
,
one
would
believe
it
might
succeed
in
these
woods
.
*NL*
Though
you
think
it
too
soon
to
listen
to
the
calls
of
humanity
,
''
he
*NL*
added
,
smiling
archly
,
``
I
may
be
permitted
to
believe
that
gallantry
*NL*
is
not
forgotten
by
one
so
young
as
yourself
.
The
daughters
of
the
*NL*
commandant
,
I
learn
,
have
passed
into
the
fort
since
it
was
invested
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
true
,
monsieur
;
but
,
so
far
from
weakening
our
efforts
,
they
*NL*
set
us
an
example
of
courage
in
their
own
fortitude
.
Were
nothing
*NL*
but
resolution
necessary
to
repel
so
accomplished
a
soldier
as
M.
de
*NL*
Montcalm
,
I
would
gladly
trust
the
defense
of
William
Henry
to
the
elder
*NL*
of
those
ladies
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
a
wise
ordinance
in
our
Salique
laws

which
says
,
`
The
crown
*NL*
of
France
shall
never
degrade
the
lance
to
the
distaff

,
''
said
Montcalm
,
*NL*
dryly
,
and
with
a
little
hauteur
;
but
instantly
adding
,
with
his
former
*NL*
frank
and
easy
air
:
``
as
all
the
nobler
qualities
are
hereditary
,
I
can
*NL*
easily
credit
you
;
though
,
as
I
said
before
,
courage
has
its
limits
,
and
*NL*
humanity
must
not
be
forgotten
.
I
trust
,
monsieur
,
you
come
authorized
*NL*
to
treat
for
the
surrender
of
the
place
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
your
excellency
found
our
defense
so
feeble
as
to
believe
the
*NL*
measure
necessary
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
be
sorry
to
have
the
defense
protracted
in
such
a
manner
as
to
*NL*
irritate
my
red
friends
there
,
''
continued
Montcalm
,
glancing
his
eyes
*NL*
at
the
group
of
grave
and
attentive
Indians
,
without
attending
to
the
*NL*
other
's
questions
;
``
I
find
it
difficult
,
even
now
,
to
limit
them
to
the
*NL*
usages
of
war
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Heyward
was
silent
;
for
a
painful
recollection
of
the
dangers
he
had
so
*NL*
recently
escaped
came
over
his
mind
,
and
recalled
the
images
of
those
*NL*
defenseless
beings
who
had
shared
in
all
his
sufferings
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ces
messieurs-la
,
''
said
Montcalm
,
following
up
the
advantage
which
he
*NL*
conceived
he
had
gained
,
``
are
most
formidable
when
baffled
;
and
it
is
*NL*
unnecessary
to
tell
you
with
what
difficulty
they
are
restrained
in
*NL*
their
anger
.
Eh
bien
,
monsieur
!
shall
we
speak
of
the
terms
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
fear
your
excellency
has
been
deceived
as
to
the
strength
of
William
*NL*
Henry
,
and
the
resources
of
its
garrison
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
not
sat
down
before
Quebec
,
but
an
earthen
work
,
that
is
*NL*
defended
by
twenty-three
hundred
gallant
men
,
''
was
the
laconic
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Our
mounds
are
earthen
,
certainly
--
nor
are
they
seated
on
the
rocks
of
*NL*
Cape
Diamond
;
but
they
stand
on
that
shore
which
proved
so
destructive
*NL*
to
Dieskau
and
his
army
.
There
is
also
a
powerful
force
within
a
few
*NL*
hours
'
march
of
us
,
which
we
account
upon
as
a
part
of
our
means
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Some
six
or
eight
thousand
men
,
''
returned
Montcalm
,
with
much
apparent
*NL*
indifference
,
``
whom
their
leader
wisely
judges
to
be
safer
in
their
*NL*
works
than
in
the
field
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
now
Heyward
's
turn
to
bite
his
lip
with
vexation
as
the
other
so
*NL*
coolly
alluded
to
a
force
which
the
young
man
knew
to
be
overrated
.
Both
*NL*
mused
a
little
while
in
silence
,
when
Montcalm
renewed
the
conversation
,
*NL*
in
a
way
that
showed
he
believed
the
visit
of
his
guest
was
solely
to
*NL*
propose
terms
of
capitulation
.
On
the
other
hand
,
Heyward
began
to
*NL*
throw
sundry
inducements
in
the
way
of
the
French
general
,
to
betray
the
*NL*
discoveries
he
had
made
through
the
intercepted
letter
.
The
artifice
*NL*
of
neither
,
however
,
succeeded
;
and
after
a
protracted
and
fruitless
*NL*
interview
,
Duncan
took
his
leave
,
favorably
impressed
with
an
opinion
of
*NL*
the
courtesy
and
talents
of
the
enemy
's
captain
,
but
as
ignorant
of
what
*NL*
he
came
to
learn
as
when
he
arrived
.
Montcalm
followed
him
as
far
as
the
*NL*
entrance
of
the
marquee
,
renewing
his
invitations
to
the
commandant
of
*NL*
the
fort
to
give
him
an
immediate
meeting
in
the
open
ground
between
the
*NL*
two
armies
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
they
separated
,
and
Duncan
returned
to
the
advanced
post
of
the
*NL*
French
,
accompanied
as
before
;
whence
he
instantly
proceeded
to
the
*NL*
fort
,
and
to
the
quarters
of
his
own
commander
.

''
*NL*

Lear
*NL*
*NL*
Major
Heyward
found
Munro
attended
only
by
his
daughters
.
Alice
sat
upon
*NL*
his
knee
,
parting
the
gray
hairs
on
the
forehead
of
the
old
man
with
*NL*
her
delicate
fingers
;
and
whenever
he
affected
to
frown
on
her
trifling
,
*NL*
appeasing
his
assumed
anger
by
pressing
her
ruby
lips
fondly
on
his
*NL*
wrinkled
brow
.
Cora
was
seated
nigh
them
,
a
calm
and
amused
looker-on
;
*NL*
regarding
the
wayward
movements
of
her
more
youthful
sister
with
that
*NL*
species
of
maternal
fondness
which
characterized
her
love
for
Alice
.
Not
*NL*
only
the
dangers
through
which
they
had
passed
,
but
those
which
still
*NL*
impended
above
them
,
appeared
to
be
momentarily
forgotten
,
in
the
*NL*
soothing
indulgence
of
such
a
family
meeting
.
It
seemed
as
if
they
had
*NL*
profited
by
the
short
truce
,
to
devote
an
instant
to
the
purest
and
best
*NL*
affection
;
the
daughters
forgetting
their
fears
,
and
the
veteran
his
*NL*
cares
,
in
the
security
of
the
moment
.
Of
this
scene
,
Duncan
,
who
,
in
*NL*
his
eagerness
to
report
his
arrival
,
had
entered
unannounced
,
stood
*NL*
many
moments
an
unobserved
and
a
delighted
spectator
.
But
the
quick
and
*NL*
dancing
eyes
of
Alice
soon
caught
a
glimpse
of
his
figure
reflected
*NL*
from
a
glass
,
and
she
sprang
blushing
from
her
father
's
knee
,
exclaiming
*NL*
aloud
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Major
Heyward
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
of
the
lad
?
''
demanded
her
father
;
``
I
have
sent
him
to
crack
a
*NL*
little
with
the
Frenchman
.
Ha
,
sir
,
you
are
young
,
and
you
're
nimble
!
*NL*
Away
with
you
,
ye
baggage
;
as
if
there
were
not
troubles
enough
for
a
*NL*
soldier
,
without
having
his
camp
filled
with
such
prattling
hussies
as
*NL*
yourself
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alice
laughingly
followed
her
sister
,
who
instantly
led
the
way
from
an
*NL*
apartment
where
she
perceived
their
presence
was
no
longer
desirable
.
*NL*
Munro
,
instead
of
demanding
the
result
of
the
young
man
's
mission
,
paced
*NL*
the
room
for
a
few
moments
,
with
his
hands
behind
his
back
,
and
his
*NL*
head
inclined
toward
the
floor
,
like
a
man
lost
in
thought
.
At
length
he
*NL*
raised
his
eyes
,
glistening
with
a
father
's
fondness
,
and
exclaimed
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
a
pair
of
excellent
girls
,
Heyward
,
and
such
as
any
one
may
*NL*
boast
of
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You

not
now
to

my
opinion

,
Colonel
Munro

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
True

lad

''
interrupted
the
impatient
old
man
;
``
you
were
about
*NL*
opening
your
mind
more
fully
on
that
matter
the
day
you
got
in
,
but
I
*NL*
did
not
think
it
becoming
in
an
old
soldier
to
be
talking
of
nuptial
*NL*
blessings
and
wedding
jokes
when
the
enemies
of
his
king
were
likely
*NL*
to
be
unbidden
guests
at
the
feast
.
But
I
was
wrong
,
Duncan
,
boy
,
I
was
*NL*
wrong
there
;
and
I
am
now
ready
to
hear
what
you
have
to
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Notwithstanding
the
pleasure
your
assurance
gives
me
,
dear
sir

I
have
*NL*
just
now
,
a
message
from
Montcalm

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
the
Frenchman
and
all
his
host
go
to
the
devil

exclaimed
the
*NL*
hasty
veteran
.
``
He
is
not
yet
master
of
William
Henry
,
nor
shall
he
*NL*
ever
be
,
provided
Webb
proves
himself
the
man
he
should
.
No
,
sir
,
thank
*NL*
Heaven
we
are
not
yet
in
such
a
strait
that
it
can
be
said
Munro
is
too
*NL*
much
pressed
to
discharge
the
little
domestic
duties
of
his
own
family

*NL*
Your
mother
was
the
only
child
of
my
bosom
friend

Duncan
;
and
I
'll
just
*NL*
give
you
a
hearing
,

all
the
knights
of
St.
Louis
were
in
a
body
*NL*
at
the
sally-port
,
with
the
French
saint
at
their
head
,
crying
to
speak
*NL*
a
word
under
favor

A
pretty
degree
of
knighthood
,
sir

is
that
which
*NL*
can
be
bought
with
sugar
hogsheads

and
then
your
twopenny
marquisates

The

is
the
order
for
dignity
and
antiquity
;
the
veritable
*NL*
`
nemo

impune

of
chivalry
.
Ye
had
ancestors
in
that
degree
,
*NL*
Duncan
,
and
they
were
an
ornament
to
the
nobles
of
Scotland
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Heyward
,
who
perceived
that
his
superior
took
a
malicious
pleasure
in
*NL*
exhibiting
his
contempt
for
the
message
of
the
French
general
,
was
*NL*
fain
to
humor
a
spleen
that
he
knew
would
be
short-lived
;
he
therefore
,
*NL*
replied
with
as
much
indifference
as
he
could
assume
on
such
a
subject
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
request

as
you
know

your

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay

found
words

plainly
comprehended

But

ask

have
you
been
as
intelligible
to

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
my
honor

no

exclaimed
Duncan
,
warmly
;
``
there
would
have
been
an
*NL*
abuse

confided
trust

I
taken
advantage

such
a
purpose

*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
notions

those

Major
Heyward

well
enough

Cora
Munro
is
a
maiden
too
discreet

a
mind
*NL*
too
elevated
and
improved

to
need
the
guardianship
even

*NL*
*NL*
``

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
--
I

I
was
not
conscious
of
having
mentioned

said
Duncan
,
*NL*
stammering
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
to
marry
whom
,
then
,
did
you
wish
my
consent

Major
Heyward

*NL*
demanded
the
old
soldier
,
erecting
himself
in
the
dignity
of
offended
*NL*
feeling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
another
,
and
not
less
lovely
child

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alice
!
''
exclaimed
the
father
,
in
an
astonishment
equal
to
that
with
*NL*
which
Duncan
had
just
repeated
the
name
of
her
sister
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Such
was
the
direction
of
my
wishes
,
sir

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
awaited
in
silence
the
result
of
the
extraordinary
*NL*
effect
produced
by
a
communication
,
which
,
as
it
now
appeared
,
was
so
*NL*
unexpected
.
For
several
minutes
Munro
paced
the
chamber
with
long
*NL*
and
rapid
strides
,
his
rigid
features
working
convulsively
,
and
every
*NL*
faculty
seemingly
absorbed
in
the
musings
of
his
own
mind
.
At
length
,
he
*NL*
paused
directly
in
front
of
Heyward
,
and
riveting
his
eyes
upon
those
of
*NL*
the
other
,
he
said
,
with
a
lip
that
quivered
violently
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Duncan
Heyward
,
I
have
loved
you
for
the
sake
of
him
whose
blood
is
*NL*
in
your
veins
;
I
have
loved
you
for
your
own
good
qualities
;
and
I
have
*NL*
loved
you
,
because
I
thought
you
would
contribute
to
the
happiness
of
my
*NL*
child
.
But
all
this
love
would
turn
to
hatred
,
were
I
assured
that
what
*NL*
I
so
much
apprehend
is
true
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
forbid
that
any
act
or
thought
of
mine
should
lead
to
such
a
*NL*
change
!
''
exclaimed
the
young
man
,
whose
eye
never
quailed
under
the
*NL*
penetrating
look
it
encountered
.
Without
adverting
to
the
impossibility
*NL*
of
the
other
's
comprehending
those
feelings
which
were
hid
in
his
*NL*
own
bosom
,
Munro
suffered
himself
to
be
appeased
by
the
unaltered
*NL*
countenance
he
met
,
and
with
a
voice
sensibly
softened
,
he
continued
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
would
be
my
son
,
Duncan
,
and
you
're
ignorant
of
the
history
of
the
*NL*
man
you
wish
to
call
your
father
.
Sit
ye
down
,
young
man
,
and
I
will
*NL*
open
to
you
the
wounds
of
a
seared
heart
,
in
as
few
words
as
may
be
*NL*
suitable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
By
this
time
,
the
message
of
Montcalm
was
as
much
forgotten
by
him
who
*NL*
bore
it
as
by
the
man
for
whose
ears
it
was
intended
.
Each
drew
a
chair
,
*NL*
and
while
the
veteran
communed
a
few
moments
with
his
own
thoughts
,
*NL*
apparently
in
sadness
,
the
youth
suppressed
his
impatience
in
a
look
and
*NL*
attitude
of
respectful
attention
.
At
length
,
the
former
spoke
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
know
,
already
,
Major
Heyward

ancient

commenced
the
Scotsman
;
``
though
it
might
not
altogether
*NL*
be
endowed
with
that
amount
of
wealth
that
should
correspond
with
its
*NL*
degree
.
I
was
,
maybe
,
such
an
one
as
yourself
when
I
plighted
my
faith
*NL*
to
Alice
Graham
,
the
only
child
of
a
neighboring
laird
of
some
estate
.
*NL*
But
the
connection
was
disagreeable
to
her
father
,
on
more
accounts
than
*NL*
my
poverty
.
I
did
,
therefore
,
what
an
honest
man
should
--
restored
the
*NL*
maiden
her
troth
,
and
departed
the
country
in
the
service
of
my
king
.
*NL*
I
had
seen
many
regions
,
and
had
shed
much
blood
in
different
lands
,
*NL*
before
duty
called
me
to
the
islands
of
the
West
Indies
.
There
it
was
*NL*
my
lot
to
form
a
connection
with
one
who
in
time
became
my
wife
,
and
the
*NL*
mother
of
Cora
.
She
was
the
daughter
of
a
gentleman
of
those
isles
,
by
*NL*
a
lady
whose
misfortune
it
was
,
if
you
will
,
''
said
the
old
man
,
proudly
,
*NL*
``
to
be
descended
,
remotely
,
from
that
unfortunate
class
who
are
so
*NL*
basely
enslaved
to
administer
to
the
wants
of
a
luxurious
people
.
Ay
,
*NL*
sir
,
that
is
a
curse
,
entailed
on
Scotland
by
her
unnatural
union
with
a
*NL*
foreign
and
trading
people
.
But
could
I
find
a
man
among
them
who
would
*NL*
dare
to
reflect
on
my
child
,
he
should
feel
the
weight
of
a
father
's
*NL*
anger
!
Ha
!
Major
Heyward
,
you
are
yourself
born
at
the
south
,
where
*NL*
these
unfortunate
beings
are
considered
of
a
race
inferior
to
your
own
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
most
unfortunately
true
,
sir
,
''
said
Duncan
,
unable
any
longer
to
*NL*
prevent
his
eyes
from
sinking
to
the
floor
in
embarrassment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
cast
it
on
my
child
as
a
reproach
!
You
scorn
to
mingle
the
*NL*
blood
of
the
Heywards
with
one
so
degraded
--
lovely
and
virtuous
though
*NL*
she
be
?
''
fiercely
demanded
the
jealous
parent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Heaven
protect
me
from
a
prejudice
so
unworthy
of
my
reason
!
''
returned
*NL*
Duncan
,
at
the
same
time
conscious
of
such
a
feeling
,
and
that
as
deeply
*NL*
rooted
as
if
it
had
been
ingrafted
in
his
nature
.
``
The
sweetness
,
the
*NL*
beauty
,
the
witchery
of
your
younger
daughter
,
Colonel
Munro
,
might
*NL*
explain
my
motives
without
imputing
to
me
this
injustice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ye
are
right
,
sir
,
''
returned
the
old
man
,
again
changing
his
tones
to
*NL*
those
of
gentleness
,
or
rather
softness
;
``
the
girl
is
the
image
of
what
*NL*
her
mother
was
at
her
years
,
and
before
she
had
become
acquainted
*NL*
with
grief
.
When
death
deprived
me
of
my
wife
I
returned
to
Scotland
,
*NL*
enriched
by
the
marriage
;
and
,
would
you
think
it
,
Duncan
!
the
suffering
*NL*
angel
had
remained
in
the
heartless
state
of
celibacy
twenty
long
years
,
*NL*
and
that
for
the
sake
of
a
man
who
could
forget
her
!
She
did
more
,
*NL*
sir
;
she
overlooked
my
want
of
faith
,
and
,
all
difficulties
being
now
*NL*
removed
,
she
took
me
for
her
husband
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
became
the
mother
of
Alice
?
''
exclaimed
Duncan
,
with
an
eagerness
*NL*
that
might
have
proved
dangerous
at
a
moment
when
the
thoughts
of
Munro
*NL*
were
less
occupied
that
at
present
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
did
,
indeed
,
''
said
the
old
man
,
``
and
dearly
did
she
pay
for
the
*NL*
blessing
she
bestowed
.
But
she
is
a
saint
in
heaven
,
sir
;
and
it
ill
*NL*
becomes
one
whose
foot
rests
on
the
grave
to
mourn
a
lot
so
blessed
.
I
*NL*
had
her
but
a
single
year
,
though
;
a
short
term
of
happiness
for
one
who
*NL*
had
seen
her
youth
fade
in
hopeless
pining
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
something
so
commanding
in
the
distress
of
the
old
man
,
that
*NL*
Heyward
did
not
dare
to
venture
a
syllable
of
consolation
.
Munro
sat
*NL*
utterly
unconscious
of
the
other
's
presence
,
his
features
exposed
and
*NL*
working
with
the
anguish
of
his
regrets
,
while
heavy
tears
fell
from
*NL*
his
eyes
,
and
rolled
unheeded
from
his
cheeks
to
the
floor
.
At
length
*NL*
he
moved
,
and
as
if
suddenly
recovering
his
recollection
;
when
he
arose
,
*NL*
and
taking
a
single
turn
across
the
room
,
he
approached
his
companion
*NL*
with
an
air
of
military
grandeur
,
and
demanded
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
not
,
Major
Heyward
,
some
communication
that
I
should
hear
from
*NL*
the
marquis
de
Montcalm
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Duncan
started
in
his
turn
,
and
immediately
commenced
in
an
embarrassed
*NL*
voice
,
the
half-forgotten
message
.
It
is
unnecessary
to
dwell
upon
the
*NL*
evasive
though
polite
manner
with
which
the
French
general
had
*NL*
eluded
every
attempt
of
Heyward
to
worm
from
him
the
purport
of
the
*NL*
communication
he
had
proposed
making
,
or
on
the
decided
,
though
still
*NL*
polished
message
,
by
which
he
now
gave
his
enemy
to
understand
,
that
,
*NL*
unless
he
chose
to
receive
it
in
person
,
he
should
not
receive
it
at
*NL*
all
.
As
Munro
listened
to
the
detail
of
Duncan
,
the
excited
feelings
of
*NL*
the
father
gradually
gave
way
before
the
obligations
of
his
station
,
*NL*
and
when
the
other
was
done
,
he
saw
before
him
nothing
but
the
veteran
,
*NL*
swelling
with
the
wounded
feelings
of
a
soldier
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
said
enough
,
Major
Heyward
,
''
exclaimed
the
angry
old
man
;
*NL*
``
enough
to
make
a
volume
of
commentary
on
French
civility
.
Here
has
*NL*
this
gentleman
invited
me
to
a
conference
,
and
when
I
send
him
a
capable
*NL*
substitute
,
for
ye
're
all
that
,
Duncan
,
though
your
years
are
but
few
,
*NL*
he
answers
me
with
a
riddle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
may
have
thought
less
favorably
of
the
substitute
,
my
dear
sir
;
and
*NL*
you
will
remember
that
the
invitation
,
which
he
now
repeats
,
was
to
the
*NL*
commandant
of
the
works
,
and
not
to
his
second
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
sir
,
is
not
a
substitute
clothed
with
all
the
power
and
dignity
*NL*
of
him
who
grants
the
commission
?
He
wishes
to
confer
with
Munro
!
Faith
,
*NL*
sir
,
I
have
much
inclination
to
indulge
the
man
,
if
it
should
only
be
to
*NL*
let
him
behold
the
firm
countenance
we
maintain
in
spite
of
his
numbers
*NL*
and
his
summons
.
There
might
be
not
bad
policy
in
such
a
stroke
,
young
*NL*
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Duncan
,
who
believed
it
of
the
last
importance
that
they
should
speedily
*NL*
come
to
the
contents
of
the
letter
borne
by
the
scout
,
gladly
encouraged
*NL*
this
idea
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Without
doubt
,
he
could
gather
no
confidence
by
witnessing
our
*NL*
indifference
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
never
said
truer
word
.
I
could
wish
,
sir
,
that
he
would
visit
the
*NL*
works
in
open
day
,
and
in
the
form
of
a
storming
party
;
that
is
the
*NL*
least
failing
method
of
proving
the
countenance
of
an
enemy
,
and
would
*NL*
be
far
preferable
to
the
battering
system
he
has
chosen
.
The
beauty
and
*NL*
manliness
of
warfare
has
been
much
deformed
,
Major
Heyward
,
by
the
arts
*NL*
of
your
Monsieur
Vauban
.
Our
ancestors
were
far
above
such
scientific
*NL*
cowardice
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
may
be
very
true
,
sir
;
but
we
are
now
obliged
to
repel
art
by
art
.
*NL*
What
is
your
pleasure
in
the
matter
of
the
interview
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
meet
the
Frenchman
,
and
that
without
fear
or
delay
;
promptly
,
*NL*
sir
,
as
becomes
a
servant
of
my
royal
master
.
Go
,
Major
Heyward
,
and
*NL*
give
them
a
flourish
of
the
music
;
and
send
out
a
messenger
to
let
them
*NL*
know
who
is
coming
.
We
will
follow
with
a
small
guard
,
for
such
respect
*NL*
is
due
to
one
who
holds
the
honor
of
his
king
in
keeping
;
and
hark
`
ee
,
*NL*
Duncan
,
''
he
added
,
in
a
half
whisper
,
though
they
were
alone
,
``
it
may
be
*NL*
prudent
to
have
some
aid
at
hand
,
in
case
there
should
be
treachery
at
*NL*
the
bottom
of
it
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
availed
himself
of
this
order
to
quit
the
apartment
;
and
,
*NL*
as
the
day
was
fast
coming
to
a
close
,
he
hastened
without
delay
,
to
*NL*
make
the
necessary
arrangements
.
A
very
few
minutes
only
were
necessary
*NL*
to
parade
a
few
files
,
and
to
dispatch
an
orderly
with
a
flag
to
*NL*
announce
the
approach
of
the
commandant
of
the
fort
.
When
Duncan
had
*NL*
done
both
these
,
he
led
the
guard
to
the
sally-port
,
near
which
he
*NL*
found
his
superior
ready
,
waiting
his
appearance
.
As
soon
as
the
usual
*NL*
ceremonials
of
a
military
departure
were
observed
,
the
veteran
and
his
*NL*
more
youthful
companion
left
the
fortress
,
attended
by
the
escort
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
proceeded
only
a
hundred
yards
from
the
works
,
when
the
little
*NL*
array
which
attended
the
French
general
to
the
conference
was
seen
*NL*
issuing
from
the
hollow
way
which
formed
the
bed
of
a
brook
that
ran
*NL*
between
the
batteries
of
the
besiegers
and
the
fort
.
From
the
moment
*NL*
that
Munro
left
his
own
works
to
appear
in
front
of
his
enemy
's
,
his
*NL*
air
had
been
grand
,
and
his
step
and
countenance
highly
military
.
The
*NL*
instant
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
white
plume
that
waved
in
the
hat
*NL*
of
Montcalm
,
his
eye
lighted
,
and
age
no
longer
appeared
to
possess
any
*NL*
influence
over
his
vast
and
still
muscular
person
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Speak
to
the
boys
to
be
watchful
,
sir
,
''
he
said
,
in
an
undertone
,
to
*NL*
Duncan
;
``
and
to
look
well
to
their
flints
and
steel
,
for
one
is
never
*NL*
safe
with
a
servant
of
these
Louis
's
;
at
the
same
time
,
we
shall
show
*NL*
them
the
front
of
men
in
deep
security
.
Ye
'll
understand
me
,
Major
*NL*
Heyward
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
interrupted
by
the
clamor
of
a
drum
from
the
approaching
*NL*
Frenchmen
,
which
was
immediately
answered
,
when
each
party
pushed
an
*NL*
orderly
in
advance
,
bearing
a
white
flag
,
and
the
wary
Scotsman
halted
*NL*
with
his
guard
close
at
his
back
.
As
soon
as
this
slight
salutation
*NL*
had
passed
,
Montcalm
moved
toward
them
with
a
quick
but
graceful
step
,
*NL*
baring
his
head
to
the
veteran
,
and
dropping
his
spotless
plume
nearly
*NL*
to
the
earth
in
courtesy
.
If
the
air
of
Munro
was
more
commanding
and
*NL*
manly
,
it
wanted
both
the
ease
and
insinuating
polish
of
that
of
the
*NL*
Frenchman
.
Neither
spoke
for
a
few
moments
,
each
regarding
the
other
*NL*
with
curious
and
interested
eyes
.
Then
,
as
became
his
superior
rank
and
*NL*
the
nature
of
the
interview
,
Montcalm
broke
the
silence
.
After
uttering
*NL*
the
usual
words
of
greeting
,
he
turned
to
Duncan
,
and
continued
,
with
a
*NL*
smile
of
recognition
,
speaking
always
in
French
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
rejoiced
,
monsieur
,
that
you
have
given
us
the
pleasure
of
your
*NL*
company
on
this
occasion
.
There
will
be
no
necessity
to
employ
an
*NL*
ordinary
interpreter
;
for
,
in
your
hands
,
I
feel
the
same
security
as
if
*NL*
I
spoke
your
language
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Duncan
acknowledged
the
compliment
,
when
Montcalm
,
turning
to
his
guard
,
*NL*
which
in
imitation
of
that
of
their
enemies
,
pressed
close
upon
him
,
*NL*
continued
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
En
arriere
,
mes
enfants
--
il
fait
chaud
--
retirez-vous
un
peu
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Before
Major
Heyward
would
imitate
this
proof
of
confidence
,
he
glanced
*NL*
his
eyes
around
the
plain
,
and
beheld
with
uneasiness
the
numerous
dusky
*NL*
groups
of
savages
,
who
looked
out
from
the
margin
of
the
surrounding
*NL*
woods
,
curious
spectators
of
the
interview
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
de
Montcalm
will
readily
acknowledge
the
difference
in
our
*NL*
situation
,
''
he
said
,
with
some
embarrassment
,
pointing
at
the
same
*NL*
time
toward
those
dangerous
foes
,
who
were
to
be
seen
in
almost
every
*NL*
direction
.
``
Were
we
to
dismiss
our
guard
,
we
should
stand
here
at
the
*NL*
mercy
of
our
enemies
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
,
you
have
the
plighted
faith
of
`
un
gentilhomme
Francais
'
,
*NL*
for
your
safety

''
returned
Montcalm
,
laying
his
hand
impressively
on
his
*NL*
heart
;
``
it
should
suffice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
shall

Fall
back
,
''
Duncan
added
to
the
officer
who
led
the
escort
;
*NL*
``
fall
back
,
sir
,
beyond
hearing
,
and
wait
for
orders
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Munro
witnessed
this
movement
with
manifest
uneasiness
;
nor
did
he
fail
*NL*
to
demand
an
instant
explanation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
not
our
interest
,
sir
,
to
betray
distrust
?
''
retorted
Duncan
.
*NL*
``
Monsieur
de
Montcalm
pledges
his
word
for
our
safety
,
and
I
have
*NL*
ordered
the
men
to
withdraw
a
little
,
in
order
to
prove
how
much
we
*NL*
depend
on
his
assurance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
may
be
all
right
,
sir
,
but
I
have
no
overweening
reliance
on
the
*NL*
faith
of
these
marquesses
,
or
marquis
,
as
they
call
themselves
.
Their
*NL*
patents
of
nobility
are
too
common
to
be
certain
that
they
bear
the
seal
*NL*
of
true
honor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
forget
,
dear
sir
,
that
we
confer
with
an
officer
,
distinguished
*NL*
alike
in
Europe
and
America
for
his
deeds
.
From
a
soldier
of
his
*NL*
reputation
we
can
have
nothing
to
apprehend
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
man
made
a
gesture
of
resignation
,
though
his
rigid
features
*NL*
still
betrayed
his
obstinate
adherence
to
a
distrust
,
which
he
derived
*NL*
from
a
sort
of
hereditary
contempt
of
his
enemy
,
rather
than
from
any
*NL*
present
signs
which
might
warrant
so
uncharitable
a
feeling
.
Montcalm
*NL*
waited
patiently
until
this
little
dialogue
in
demi-voice
was
ended
,
*NL*
when
he
drew
nigher
,
and
opened
the
subject
of
their
conference
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
solicited
this
interview
from
your
superior
,
monsieur
,
''
he
said
,
*NL*
``
because
I
believe
he
will
allow
himself
to
be
persuaded
that
he
has
*NL*
already
done
everything
which
is
necessary
for
the
honor
of
his
prince
,
*NL*
and
will
now
listen
to
the
admonitions
of
humanity
.
I
will
forever
bear
*NL*
testimony
that
his
resistance
has
been
gallant
,
and
was
continued
as
*NL*
long
as
there
was
hope
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
this
opening
was
translated
to
Munro
,
he
answered
with
dignity
,
but
*NL*
with
sufficient
courtesy
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
However
I
may
prize
such
testimony
from
Monsieur
Montcalm
,
it
will
be
*NL*
more
valuable
when
it
shall
be
better
merited
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
French
general
smiled
,
as
Duncan
gave
him
the
purport
of
this
reply
,
*NL*
and
observed
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
now
so
freely
accorded
to
approved
courage
,
may
be
refused
to
*NL*
useless
obstinacy
.
Monsieur
would
wish
to
see
my
camp
,
and
witness
for
*NL*
himself
our
numbers
,
and
the
impossibility
of
his
resisting
them
with
*NL*
success
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
that
the
king
of
France
is
well
served
,
''
returned
the
unmoved
*NL*
Scotsman
,
as
soon
as
Duncan
ended
his
translation
;
``
but
my
own
royal
*NL*
master
has
as
many
and
as
faithful
troops
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Though
not
at
hand
,
fortunately
for
us
,
''
said
Montcalm
,
without
*NL*
waiting
,
in
his
ardor
,
for
the
interpreter
.
``
There
is
a
destiny
in
war
,
*NL*
to
which
a
brave
man
knows
how
to
submit
with
the
same
courage
that
he
*NL*
faces
his
foes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Had
I
been
conscious
that
Monsieur
Montcalm
was
master
of
the
English
,
*NL*
I
should
have
spared
myself
the
trouble
of
so
awkward
a
translation
,
''
*NL*
said
the
vexed
Duncan
,
dryly
;
remembering
instantly
his
recent
by-play
*NL*
with
Munro
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
pardon
,
monsieur
,
''
rejoined
the
Frenchman
,
suffering
a
slight
*NL*
color
to
appear
on
his
dark
cheek
.
``
There
is
a
vast
difference
between
*NL*
understanding
and
speaking
a
foreign
tongue
;
you
will
,
therefore
,
please
*NL*
to
assist
me
still
.
''
Then
,
after
a
short
pause
,
he
added
:
``
These
hills
*NL*
afford
us
every
opportunity
of
reconnoitering
your
works
,
messieurs
,
and
*NL*
I
am
possibly
as
well
acquainted
with
their
weak
condition
as
you
can
be
*NL*
yourselves
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ask
the
French
general
if
his
glasses
can
reach
to
the
Hudson
,
''
said
*NL*
Munro
,
proudly
;
``
and
if
he
knows
when
and
where
to
expect
the
army
of
*NL*
Webb
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
General
Webb
be
his
own
interpreter
,
''
returned
the
politic
*NL*
Montcalm
,
suddenly
extending
an
open
letter
toward
Munro
as
he
spoke
;
*NL*
``
you
will
there
learn
,
monsieur
,
that
his
movements
are
not
likely
to
*NL*
prove
embarrassing
to
my
army
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
veteran
seized
the
offered
paper
,
without
waiting
for
Duncan
to
*NL*
translate
the
speech
,
and
with
an
eagerness
that
betrayed
how
important
*NL*
he
deemed
its
contents
.
As
his
eye
passed
hastily
over
the
words
,
his
*NL*
countenance
changed
from
its
look
of
military
pride
to
one
of
deep
*NL*
chagrin
;
his
lip
began
to
quiver
;
and
suffering
the
paper
to
fall
from
*NL*
his
hand
,
his
head
dropped
upon
his
chest
,
like
that
of
a
man
whose
*NL*
hopes
were
withered
at
a
single
blow
.
Duncan
caught
the
letter
from
the
*NL*
ground
,
and
without
apology
for
the
liberty
he
took
,
he
read
at
a
glance
*NL*
its
cruel
purport
.
Their
common
superior
,
so
far
from
encouraging
them
*NL*
to
resist
,
advised
a
speedy
surrender
,
urging
in
the
plainest
language
,
*NL*
as
a
reason
,
the
utter
impossibility
of
his
sending
a
single
man
to
*NL*
their
rescue
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
is
no
deception
!
''
exclaimed
Duncan
,
examining
the
billet
both
*NL*
inside
and
out
;
``
this
is
the
signature
of
Webb
,
and
must
be
the
captured
*NL*
letter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
man
has
betrayed
me
!
''
Munro
at
length
bitterly
exclaimed
;
``
he
has
*NL*
brought
dishonor
to
the
door
of
one
where
disgrace
was
never
before
*NL*
known
to
dwell
,
and
shame
has
he
heaped
heavily
on
my
gray
hairs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
not
so
,
''
cried
Duncan
;
``
we
are
yet
masters
of
the
fort
,
and
of
our
*NL*
honor
.
Let
us
,
then
,
sell
our
lives
at
such
a
rate
as
shall
make
our
*NL*
enemies
believe
the
purchase
too
dear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Boy
,
I
thank
thee
,
''
exclaimed
the
old
man
,
rousing
himself
from
his
*NL*
stupor
;
``
you
have
,
for
once
,
reminded
Munro
of
his
duty
.
We
will
go
*NL*
back
,
and
dig
our
graves
behind
those
ramparts
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Messieurs
,
''
said
Montcalm
,
advancing
toward
them
a
step
,
in
generous
*NL*
interest
,
``
you
little
know
Louis
de
St.
Veran
if
you
believe
him
capable
*NL*
of
profiting
by
this
letter
to
humble
brave
men
,
or
to
build
up
a
*NL*
dishonest
reputation
for
himself
.
Listen
to
my
terms
before
you
leave
*NL*
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
says
the
Frenchman
?
''
demanded
the
veteran
,
sternly
;
``
does
he
make
*NL*
a
merit
of
having
captured
a
scout
,
with
a
note
from
headquarters
?
Sir
,
*NL*
he
had
better
raise
this
siege
,
to
go
and
sit
down
before
Edward
if
he
*NL*
wishes
to
frighten
his
enemy
with
words
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Duncan
explained
the
other
's
meaning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
de
Montcalm
,
we
will
hear
you
,
''
the
veteran
added
,
more
*NL*
calmly
,
as
Duncan
ended
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
retain
the
fort
is
now
impossible
,
''
said
his
liberal
enemy
;
``
it
is
*NL*
necessary
to
the
interests
of
my
master
that
it
should
be
destroyed
;
but
*NL*
as
for
yourselves
and
your
brave
comrades
,
there
is
no
privilege
dear
to
*NL*
a
soldier
that
shall
be
denied
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Our
colors
?
''
demanded
Heyward
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Carry
them
to
England
,
and
show
them
to
your
king
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Our
arms
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Keep
them
;
none
can
use
them
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Our
march
;
the
surrender
of
the
place
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
all
be
done
in
a
way
most
honorable
to
yourselves
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Duncan
now
turned
to
explain
these
proposals
to
his
commander
,
who
heard
*NL*
him
with
amazement
,
and
a
sensibility
that
was
deeply
touched
by
so
*NL*
unusual
and
unexpected
generosity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
you
,
Duncan
,
''
he
said
;
``
go
with
this
marquess
,
as
,
indeed
,
marquess
*NL*
he
should
be
;
go
to
his
marquee
and
arrange
it
all
.
I
have
lived
to
*NL*
see
two
things
in
my
old
age
that
never
did
I
expect
to
behold
.
An
*NL*
Englishman
afraid
to
support
a
friend
,
and
a
Frenchman
too
honest
to
*NL*
profit
by
his
advantage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
saying
,
the
veteran
again
dropped
his
head
to
his
chest
,
and
returned
*NL*
slowly
toward
the
fort
,
exhibiting
,
by
the
dejection
of
his
air
,
to
the
*NL*
anxious
garrison
,
a
harbinger
of
evil
tidings
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
shock
of
this
unexpected
blow
the
haughty
feelings
of
Munro
*NL*
never
recovered
;
but
from
that
moment
there
commenced
a
change
in
his
*NL*
determined
character
,
which
accompanied
him
to
a
speedy
grave
.
Duncan
*NL*
remained
to
settle
the
terms
of
the
capitulation
.
He
was
seen
*NL*
to
re-enter
the
works
during
the
first
watches
of
the
night
,
and
*NL*
immediately
after
a
private
conference
with
the
commandant
,
to
*NL*
leave
them
again
.
It
was
then
openly
announced
that
hostilities
must
*NL*
cease
--
Munro
having
signed
a
treaty
by
which
the
place
was
to
be
yielded
*NL*
to
the
enemy
,
with
the
morning
;
the
garrison
to
retain
their
arms
,
*NL*
the
colors
and
their
baggage
,
and
,
consequently
,
according
to
military
*NL*
opinion
,
their
honor
.

Gray
*NL*
*NL*
The
hostile
armies
,
which
lay
in
the
wilds
of
the
Horican
,
passed
the
*NL*
night
of
the
ninth
of
August
,
1757
,
much
in
the
manner
they
would
,
had
*NL*
they
encountered
on
the
fairest
field
of
Europe
.
While
the
conquered
*NL*
were
still
,
sullen
,
and
dejected
,
the
victors
triumphed
.
But
there
*NL*
are
limits
alike
to
grief
and
joy
;
and
long
before
the
watches
of
the
*NL*
morning
came
the
stillness
of
those
boundless
woods
was
only
broken
by
a
*NL*
gay
call
from
some
exulting
young
Frenchman
of
the
advanced
pickets
,
or
*NL*
a
menacing
challenge
from
the
fort
,
which
sternly
forbade
the
approach
*NL*
of
any
hostile
footsteps
before
the
stipulated
moment
.
Even
these
*NL*
occasional
threatening
sounds
ceased
to
be
heard
in
that
dull
hour
which
*NL*
precedes
the
day
,
at
which
period
a
listener
might
have
sought
in
vain
*NL*
any
evidence
of
the
presence
of
those
armed
powers
that
then
slumbered
*NL*
on
the
shores
of
the
``
holy
lake
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
during
these
moments
of
deep
silence
that
the
canvas
which
*NL*
concealed
the
entrance
to
a
spacious
marquee
in
the
French
encampment
*NL*
was
shoved
aside
,
and
a
man
issued
from
beneath
the
drapery
into
the
*NL*
open
air
.
He
was
enveloped
in
a
cloak
that
might
have
been
intended
as
*NL*
a
protection
from
the
chilling
damps
of
the
woods
,
but
which
served
*NL*
equally
well
as
a
mantle
to
conceal
his
person
.
He
was
permitted
to
pass
*NL*
the
grenadier
,
who
watched
over
the
slumbers
of
the
French
commander
,
*NL*
without
interruption
,
the
man
making
the
usual
salute
which
betokens
*NL*
military
deference
,
as
the
other
passed
swiftly
through
the
little
*NL*
city
of
tents
,
in
the
direction
of
William
Henry
.
Whenever
this
unknown
*NL*
individual
encountered
one
of
the
numberless
sentinels
who
crossed
his
*NL*
path
,
his
answer
was
prompt
,
and
,
as
it
appeared
,
satisfactory
;
for
he
*NL*
was
uniformly
allowed
to
proceed
without
further
interrogation
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
the
exception
of
such
repeated
but
brief
interruptions
,
he
*NL*
had
moved
silently
from
the
center
of
the
camp
to
its
most
advanced
*NL*
outposts
,
when
he
drew
nigh
the
soldier
who
held
his
watch
nearest
to
*NL*
the
works
of
the
enemy
.
As
he
approached
he
was
received
with
the
usual
*NL*
challenge
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Qui
vive
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
France
,
''
was
the
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Le
mot
d'ordre
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
La
victorie
,
''
said
the
other
,
drawing
so
nigh
as
to
be
heard
in
a
loud
*NL*
whisper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
C'est
bien
,
''
returned
the
sentinel
,
throwing
his
musket
from
the
charge
*NL*
to
his
shoulder
;
``
vous
promenez
bien
matin
,
monsieur
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Il
est
necessaire
d'etre
vigilant
,
mon
enfant
,
''
the
other
observed
,
*NL*
dropping
a
fold
of
his
cloak
,
and
looking
the
soldier
close
in
the
*NL*
face
as
he
passed
him
,
still
continuing
his
way
toward
the
British
*NL*
fortification
.
The
man
started
;
his
arms
rattled
heavily
as
he
threw
*NL*
them
forward
in
the
lowest
and
most
respectful
salute
;
and
when
he
had
*NL*
again
recovered
his
piece
,
he
turned
to
walk
his
post
,
muttering
between
*NL*
his
teeth
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Il
faut
etre
vigilant
,
en
verite
!
je
crois
que
nous
avons
la
,
un
*NL*
caporal
qui
ne
dort
jamais
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
officer
proceeded
,
without
affecting
to
hear
the
words
which
escaped
*NL*
the
sentinel
in
his
surprise
;
nor
did
he
again
pause
until
he
had
*NL*
reached
the
low
strand
,
and
in
a
somewhat
dangerous
vicinity
to
the
*NL*
western
water
bastion
of
the
fort
.
The
light
of
an
obscure
moon
was
just
*NL*
sufficient
to
render
objects
,
though
dim
,
perceptible
in
their
outlines
.
*NL*
He
,
therefore
,
took
the
precaution
to
place
himself
against
the
trunk
of
*NL*
a
tree
,
where
he
leaned
for
many
minutes
,
and
seemed
to
contemplate
the
*NL*
dark
and
silent
mounds
of
the
English
works
in
profound
attention
.
His
*NL*
gaze
at
the
ramparts
was
not
that
of
a
curious
or
idle
spectator
;
*NL*
but
his
looks
wandered
from
point
to
point
,
denoting
his
knowledge
of
*NL*
military
usages
,
and
betraying
that
his
search
was
not
unaccompanied
*NL*
by
distrust
.
At
length
he
appeared
satisfied
;
and
having
cast
his
eyes
*NL*
impatiently
upward
toward
the
summit
of
the
eastern
mountain
,
as
if
*NL*
anticipating
the
approach
of
the
morning
,
he
was
in
the
act
of
turning
*NL*
on
his
footsteps
,
when
a
light
sound
on
the
nearest
angle
of
the
bastion
*NL*
caught
his
ear
,
and
induced
him
to
remain
.
*NL*
*NL*
Just
then
a
figure
was
seen
to
approach
the
edge
of
the
rampart
,
where
*NL*
it
stood
,
apparently
contemplating
in
its
turn
the
distant
tents
of
the
*NL*
French
encampment
.
Its
head
was
then
turned
toward
the
east
,
as
though
*NL*
equally
anxious
for
the
appearance
of
light
,
when
the
form
leaned
*NL*
against
the
mound
,
and
seemed
to
gaze
upon
the
glassy
expanse
of
the
*NL*
waters
,
which
,
like
a
submarine
firmament
,
glittered
with
its
thousand
*NL*
mimic
stars
.
The
melancholy
air
,
the
hour
,
together
with
the
vast
frame
*NL*
of
the
man
who
thus
leaned
,
musing
,
against
the
English
ramparts
,
*NL*
left
no
doubt
as
to
his
person
in
the
mind
of
the
observant
spectator
.
*NL*
Delicacy
,
no
less
than
prudence
,
now
urged
him
to
retire
;
and
he
had
*NL*
moved
cautiously
round
the
body
of
the
tree
for
that
purpose
,
when
*NL*
another
sound
drew
his
attention
,
and
once
more
arrested
his
footsteps
.
*NL*
It
was
a
low
and
almost
inaudible
movement
of
the
water
,
and
was
*NL*
succeeded
by
a
grating
of
pebbles
one
against
the
other
.
In
a
moment
*NL*
he
saw
a
dark
form
rise
,
as
it
were
,
out
of
the
lake
,
and
steal
without
*NL*
further
noise
to
the
land
,
within
a
few
feet
of
the
place
where
he
*NL*
himself
stood
.
A
rifle
next
slowly
rose
between
his
eyes
and
the
watery
*NL*
mirror
;
but
before
it
could
be
discharged
his
own
hand
was
on
the
lock
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hugh
!
''
exclaimed
the
savage
,
whose
treacherous
aim
was
so
singularly
*NL*
and
so
unexpectedly
interrupted
.
*NL*
*NL*
Without
making
any
reply
,
the
French
officer
laid
his
hand
on
the
*NL*
shoulder
of
the
Indian
,
and
led
him
in
profound
silence
to
a
distance
*NL*
from
the
spot
,
where
their
subsequent
dialogue
might
have
proved
*NL*
dangerous
,
and
where
it
seemed
that
one
of
them
,
at
least
,
sought
a
*NL*
victim
.
Then
throwing
open
his
cloak
,
so
as
to
expose
his
uniform
and
*NL*
the
cross
of
St.
Louis
which
was
suspended
at
his
breast
,
Montcalm
*NL*
sternly
demanded
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
means
this
?
Does
not
my
son
know
that
the
hatchet
is
buried
*NL*
between
the
English
and
his
Canadian
Father
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
can
the
Hurons
do
?
''
returned
the
savage
,
speaking
also
,
though
*NL*
imperfectly
,
in
the
French
language
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
a
warrior
has
a
scalp
,
and
the
pale
faces
make
friends
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ha
,
Le
Renard
Subtil
!
Methinks
this
is
an
excess
of
zeal
for
a
friend
*NL*
who
was
so
late
an
enemy
!
How
many
suns
have
set
since
Le
Renard
struck
*NL*
the
war-post
of
the
English
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
is
that
sun
?
''
demanded
the
sullen
savage
.
``
Behind
the
hill
;
and
*NL*
it
is
dark
and
cold
.
But
when
he
comes
again
,
it
will
be
bright
and
*NL*
warm
.
Le
Subtil
is
the
sun
of
his
tribe
.
There
have
been
clouds
,
and
*NL*
many
mountains
between
him
and
his
nation
;
but
now
he
shines
and
it
is
a
*NL*
clear
sky
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
Le
Renard
has
power
with
his
people
,
I
well
know
,
''
said
Montcalm
;
*NL*
``
for
yesterday
he
hunted
for
their
scalps
,
and
to-day
they
hear
him
at
*NL*
the
council-fire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Magua
is
a
great
chief
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
him
prove
it
,
by
teaching
his
nation
how
to
conduct
themselves
*NL*
toward
our
new
friends
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
did
the
chief
of
the
Canadas
bring
his
young
men
into
the
woods
,
*NL*
and
fire
his
cannon
at
the
earthen
house
?
''
demanded
the
subtle
Indian
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
subdue
it
.
My
master
owns
the
land
,
and
your
father
was
ordered
to
*NL*
drive
off
these
English
squatters
.
They
have
consented
to
go
,
and
now
he
*NL*
calls
them
enemies
no
longer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
well
.
Magua
took
the
hatchet
to
color
it
with
blood
.
It
is
now
*NL*
bright
;
when
it
is
red
,
it
shall
be
buried
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
Magua
is
pledged
not
to
sully
the
lilies
of
France
.
The
enemies
of
*NL*
the
great
king
across
the
salt
lake
are
his
enemies
;
his
friends
,
the
*NL*
friends
of
the
Hurons
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Friends
!
''
repeated
the
Indian
in
scorn
.
``
Let
his
father
give
Magua
a
*NL*
hand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Montcalm
,
who
felt
that
his
influence
over
the
warlike
tribes
he
had
*NL*
gathered
was
to
be
maintained
by
concession
rather
than
by
power
,
*NL*
complied
reluctantly
with
the
other
's
request
.
The
savage
placed
the
*NL*
fingers
of
the
French
commander
on
a
deep
scar
in
his
bosom
,
and
then
*NL*
exultingly
demanded
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
my
father
know
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
warrior
does
not
?
'T
is
where
a
leaden
bullet
has
cut
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
this
?
''
continued
the
Indian
,
who
had
turned
his
naked
back
to
the
*NL*
other
,
his
body
being
without
its
usual
calico
mantle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
!
--
my
son
has
been
sadly
injured
here
;
who
has
done
this
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Magua
slept
hard
in
the
English
wigwams
,
and
the
sticks
have
left
their
*NL*
mark
,
''
returned
the
savage
,
with
a
hollow
laugh
,
which
did
not
conceal
*NL*
the
fierce
temper
that
nearly
choked
him
.
Then
,
recollecting
himself
,
*NL*
with
sudden
and
native
dignity
,
he
added
:
``
Go
;
teach
your
young
men
it
*NL*
is
peace
.
Le
Renard
Subtil
knows
how
to
speak
to
a
Huron
warrior
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Without
deigning
to
bestow
further
words
,
or
to
wait
for
any
answer
,
*NL*
the
savage
cast
his
rifle
into
the
hollow
of
his
arm
,
and
moved
silently
*NL*
through
the
encampment
toward
the
woods
where
his
own
tribe
was
known
to
*NL*
lie
.
Every
few
yards
as
he
proceeded
he
was
challenged
by
the
sentinels
;
*NL*
but
he
stalked
sullenly
onward
,
utterly
disregarding
the
summons
of
the
*NL*
soldiers
,
who
only
spared
his
life
because
they
knew
the
air
and
tread
*NL*
no
less
than
the
obstinate
daring
of
an
Indian
.
*NL*
*NL*
Montcalm
lingered
long
and
melancholy
on
the
strand
where
he
had
*NL*
been
left
by
his
companion
,
brooding
deeply
on
the
temper
which
his
*NL*
ungovernable
ally
had
just
discovered
.
Already
had
his
fair
fame
been
*NL*
tarnished
by
one
horrid
scene
,
and
in
circumstances
fearfully
resembling
*NL*
those
under
which
he
now
found
himself
.
As
he
mused
he
became
keenly
*NL*
sensible
of
the
deep
responsibility
they
assume
who
disregard
the
means
*NL*
to
attain
the
end
,
and
of
all
the
danger
of
setting
in
motion
an
engine
*NL*
which
it
exceeds
human
power
to
control
.
Then
shaking
off
a
train
of
*NL*
reflections
that
he
accounted
a
weakness
in
such
a
moment
of
triumph
,
*NL*
he
retraced
his
steps
toward
his
tent
,
giving
the
order
as
he
passed
to
*NL*
make
the
signal
that
should
arouse
the
army
from
its
slumbers
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
tap
of
the
French
drums
was
echoed
from
the
bosom
of
the
fort
,
*NL*
and
presently
the
valley
was
filled
with
the
strains
of
martial
music
,
*NL*
rising
long
,
thrilling
and
lively
above
the
rattling
accompaniment
.
The
*NL*
horns
of
the
victors
sounded
merry
and
cheerful
flourishes
,
until
the
*NL*
last
laggard
of
the
camp
was
at
his
post
;
but
the
instant
the
British
*NL*
fifes
had
blown
their
shrill
signal
,
they
became
mute
.
In
the
meantime
*NL*
the
day
had
dawned
,
and
when
the
line
of
the
French
army
was
ready
to
*NL*
receive
its
general
,
the
rays
of
a
brilliant
sun
were
glancing
along
the
*NL*
glittering
array
.
Then
that
success
,
which
was
already
so
well
known
,
*NL*
was
officially
announced
;
the
favored
band
who
were
selected
to
guard
*NL*
the
gates
of
the
fort
were
detailed
,
and
defiled
before
their
chief
;
the
*NL*
signal
of
their
approach
was
given
,
and
all
the
usual
preparations
for
*NL*
a
change
of
masters
were
ordered
and
executed
directly
under
the
guns
of
*NL*
the
contested
works
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
very
different
scene
presented
itself
within
the
lines
of
the
*NL*
Anglo-American
army
.
As
soon
as
the
warning
signal
was
given
,
it
*NL*
exhibited
all
the
signs
of
a
hurried
and
forced
departure
.
The
sullen
*NL*
soldiers
shouldered
their
empty
tubes
and
fell
into
their
places
,
*NL*
like
men
whose
blood
had
been
heated
by
the
past
contest
,
and
who
only
*NL*
desired
the
opportunity
to
revenge
an
indignity
which
was
still
wounding
*NL*
to
their
pride
,
concealed
as
it
was
under
the
observances
of
military
*NL*
etiquette
.
*NL*
*NL*
Women
and
children
ran
from
place
to
place
,
some
bearing
the
scanty
*NL*
remnants
of
their
baggage
,
and
others
searching
in
the
ranks
for
those
*NL*
countenances
they
looked
up
to
for
protection
.
*NL*
*NL*
Munro
appeared
among
his
silent
troops
firm
but
dejected
.
It
was
evident
*NL*
that
the
unexpected
blow
had
struck
deep
into
his
heart
,
though
he
*NL*
struggled
to
sustain
his
misfortune
with
the
port
of
a
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
Duncan
was
touched
at
the
quiet
and
impressive
exhibition
of
his
grief
.
*NL*
He
had
discharged
his
own
duty
,
and
he
now
pressed
to
the
side
of
the
*NL*
old
man
,
to
know
in
what
particular
he
might
serve
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
daughters
,
''
was
the
brief
but
expressive
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
heavens
!
are
not
arrangements
already
made
for
their
convenience
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To-day
I
am
only
a
soldier
,
Major
Heyward
,
''
said
the
veteran
.
``
All
that
*NL*
you
see
here
,
claim
alike
to
be
my
children
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Duncan
had
heard
enough
.
Without
losing
one
of
those
moments
which
had
*NL*
now
become
so
precious
,
he
flew
toward
the
quarters
of
Munro
,
in
quest
*NL*
of
the
sisters
.
He
found
them
on
the
threshold
of
the
low
edifice
,
*NL*
already
prepared
to
depart
,
and
surrounded
by
a
clamorous
and
weeping
*NL*
assemblage
of
their
own
sex
,
that
had
gathered
about
the
place
,
with
a
*NL*
sort
of
instinctive
consciousness
that
it
was
the
point
most
likely
to
*NL*
be
protected
.
Though
the
cheeks
of
Cora
were
pale
and
her
countenance
*NL*
anxious
,
she
had
lost
none
of
her
firmness
;
but
the
eyes
of
Alice
were
*NL*
inflamed
,
and
betrayed
how
long
and
bitterly
she
had
wept
.
They
both
,
*NL*
however
,
received
the
young
man
with
undisguised
pleasure
;
the
former
,
*NL*
for
a
novelty
,
being
the
first
to
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
fort
is
lost
,
''
she
said
,
with
a
melancholy
smile
;
``
though
our
good
*NL*
name
,
I
trust
,
remains
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
brighter
than
ever
.
But
,
dearest
Miss
Munro
,
it
is
time
to
think
*NL*
less
of
others
,
and
to
make
some
provision
for
yourself
.
Military
*NL*
usage
--
pride
--
that
pride
on
which
you
so
much
value
yourself
,
demands
*NL*
that
your
father
and
I
should
for
a
little
while
continue
with
the
*NL*
troops
.
Then
where
to
seek
a
proper
protector
for
you
against
the
*NL*
confusion
and
chances
of
such
a
scene
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
None
is
necessary
,
''
returned
Cora
;
``
who
will
dare
to
injure
or
insult
*NL*
the
daughter
of
such
a
father
,
at
a
time
like
this
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
not
leave
you
alone
,
''
continued
the
youth
,
looking
about
him
*NL*
in
a
hurried
manner
,
``
for
the
command
of
the
best
regiment
in
the
pay
of
*NL*
the
king
.
Remember
,
our
Alice
is
not
gifted
with
all
your
firmness
,
and
*NL*
God
only
knows
the
terror
she
might
endure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
be
right
,
''
Cora
replied
,
smiling
again
,
but
far
more
sadly
than
*NL*
before
.
``
Listen
!
chance
has
already
sent
us
a
friend
when
he
is
most
*NL*
needed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Duncan
did
listen
,
and
on
the
instant
comprehended
her
meaning
.
The
low
*NL*
and
serious
sounds
of
the
sacred
music
,
so
well
known
to
the
eastern
*NL*
provinces
,
caught
his
ear
,
and
instantly
drew
him
to
an
apartment
in
*NL*
an
adjacent
building
,
which
had
already
been
deserted
by
its
customary
*NL*
tenants
.
There
he
found
David
,
pouring
out
his
pious
feelings
through
*NL*
the
only
medium
in
which
he
ever
indulged
.
Duncan
waited
,
until
,
by
the
*NL*
cessation
of
the
movement
of
the
hand
,
he
believed
the
strain
was
ended
,
*NL*
when
,
by
touching
his
shoulder
,
he
drew
the
attention
of
the
other
to
*NL*
himself
,
and
in
a
few
words
explained
his
wishes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Even
so
,
''
replied
the
single-minded
disciple
of
the
King
of
Israel
,
*NL*
when
the
young
man
had
ended
;
``
I
have
found
much
that
is
comely
and
*NL*
melodious
in
the
maidens
,
and
it
is
fitting
that
we
who
have
consorted
*NL*
in
so
much
peril
,
should
abide
together
in
peace
.
I
will
attend
them
,
*NL*
when
I
have
completed
my
morning
praise
,
to
which
nothing
is
now
wanting
*NL*
but
the
doxology
.
Wilt
thou
bear
a
part
,
friend
?
The
meter
is
common
,
*NL*
and
the
tune
`
Southwell
'
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
extending
the
little
volume
,
and
giving
the
pitch
of
the
air
anew
*NL*
with
considerate
attention
,
David
recommenced
and
finished
his
strains
,
*NL*
with
a
fixedness
of
manner
that
it
was
not
easy
to
interrupt
.
Heyward
*NL*
was
fain
to
wait
until
the
verse
was
ended
;
when
,
seeing
David
relieving
*NL*
himself
from
the
spectacles
,
and
replacing
the
book
,
he
continued
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
will
be
your
duty
to
see
that
none
dare
to
approach
the
ladies
with
*NL*
any
rude
intention
,
or
to
offer
insult
or
taunt
at
the
misfortune
of
*NL*
their
brave
father
.
In
this
task
you
will
be
seconded
by
the
domestics
*NL*
of
their
household
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Even
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
possible
that
the
Indians

stragglers
of

enemy
may
*NL*
intrude
,
in
which
case
you
will
remind
them
of
the
terms
of
the
*NL*
capitulation
,
and
threaten
to
report
their
conduct
to
Montcalm
.
A
word
*NL*
will
suffice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
not
,
I
have
that
here
which
shall
,
''
returned
David
,
exhibiting
*NL*
his
book
,
with
an
air
in
which
meekness
and
confidence
were
singularly
*NL*
blended
.
Here
are
words
which
,
uttered
,
or
rather
thundered
,
with
proper
*NL*
emphasis
,
and
in
measured
time
,
shall
quiet
the
most
unruly
temper
:
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Why
rage
the
heathen
furiously
'
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Enough
,
''
said
Heyward
,
interrupting
the
burst
of
his
musical
*NL*
invocation
;
``
we
understand
each
other
;
it
is
time
that
we
should
now
*NL*
assume
our
respective
duties
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gamut
cheerfully
assented
,
and
together
they
sought
the
females
.
Cora
*NL*
received
her
new
and
somewhat
extraordinary
protector
courteously
,
at
*NL*
least
;
and
even
the
pallid
features
of
Alice
lighted
again
with
some
of
*NL*
their
native
archness
as
she
thanked
Heyward
for
his
care
.
Duncan
*NL*
took
occasion
to
assure
them
he
had
done
the
best
that
circumstances
*NL*
permitted
,
and
,
as
he
believed
,
quite
enough
for
the
security
of
*NL*
their
feelings
;
of
danger
there
was
none
.
He
then
spoke
gladly
of
his
*NL*
intention
to
rejoin
them
the
moment
he
had
led
the
advance
a
few
miles
*NL*
toward
the
Hudson
,
and
immediately
took
his
leave
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
this
time
the
signal
for
departure
had
been
given
,
and
the
head
of
*NL*
the
English
column
was
in
motion
.
The
sisters
started
at
the
sound
,
and
*NL*
glancing
their
eyes
around
,
they
saw
the
white
uniforms
of
the
French
*NL*
grenadiers
,
who
had
already
taken
possession
of
the
gates
of
the
fort
.
*NL*
At
that
moment
an
enormous
cloud
seemed
to
pass
suddenly
above
their
*NL*
heads
,
and
,
looking
upward
,
they
discovered
that
they
stood
beneath
the
*NL*
wide
folds
of
the
standard
of
France
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
go
,
''
said
Cora
;
``
this
is
no
longer
a
fit
place
for
the
children
*NL*
of
an
English
officer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alice
clung
to
the
arm
of
her
sister
,
and
together
they
left
the
parade
,
*NL*
accompanied
by
the
moving
throng
that
surrounded
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
passed
the
gates
,
the
French
officers
,
who
had
learned
their
*NL*
rank
,
bowed
often
and
low
,
forbearing
,
however
,
to
intrude
those
*NL*
attentions
which
they
saw
,
with
peculiar
tact
,
might
not
be
agreeable
.
*NL*
As
every
vehicle
and
each
beast
of
burden
was
occupied
by
the
sick
and
*NL*
wounded
,
Cora
had
decided
to
endure
the
fatigues
of
a
foot
march
,
rather
*NL*
than
interfere
with
their
comforts
.
Indeed
,
many
a
maimed
and
feeble
*NL*
soldier
was
compelled
to
drag
his
exhausted
limbs
in
the
rear
of
the
*NL*
columns
,
for
the
want
of
the
necessary
means
of
conveyance
in
that
*NL*
wilderness
.
The
whole
,
however
,
was
in
motion
;
the
weak
and
wounded
,
*NL*
groaning
and
in
suffering
;
their
comrades
silent
and
sullen
;
and
the
*NL*
women
and
children
in
terror
,
they
knew
not
of
what
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
confused
and
timid
throng
left
the
protecting
mounds
of
the
fort
,
*NL*
and
issued
on
the
open
plain
,
the
whole
scene
was
at
once
presented
to
*NL*
their
eyes
.
At
a
little
distance
on
the
right
,
and
somewhat
in
the
*NL*
rear
,
the
French
army
stood
to
their
arms
,
Montcalm
having
collected
his
*NL*
parties
,
so
soon
as
his
guards
had
possession
of
the
works
.
They
were
*NL*
attentive
but
silent
observers
of
the
proceedings
of
the
vanquished
,
*NL*
failing
in
none
of
the
stipulated
military
honors
,
and
offering
no
taunt
*NL*
or
insult
,
in
their
success
,
to
their
less
fortunate
foes
.
Living
masses
*NL*
of
the
English
,
to
the
amount
,
in
the
whole
,
of
near
three
thousand
,
*NL*
were
moving
slowly
across
the
plain
,
toward
the
common
center
,
and
*NL*
gradually
approached
each
other
,
as
they
converged
to
the
point
of
their
*NL*
march
,
a
vista
cut
through
the
lofty
trees
,
where
the
road
to
the
Hudson
*NL*
entered
the
forest
.
Along
the
sweeping
borders
of
the
woods
hung
a
dark
*NL*
cloud
of
savages
,
eyeing
the
passage
of
their
enemies
,
and
hovering
at
*NL*
a
distance
,
like
vultures
who
were
only
kept
from
swooping
on
their
prey
*NL*
by
the
presence
and
restraint
of
a
superior
army
.
A
few
had
straggled
*NL*
among
the
conquered
columns
,
where
they
stalked
in
sullen
discontent
;
*NL*
attentive
,
though
,
as
yet
,
passive
observers
of
the
moving
multitude
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
advance
,
with
Heyward
at
its
head
,
had
already
reached
the
defile
,
*NL*
and
was
slowly
disappearing
,
when
the
attention
of
Cora
was
drawn
to
*NL*
a
collection
of
stragglers
by
the
sounds
of
contention
.
A
truant
*NL*
provincial
was
paying
the
forfeit
of
his
disobedience
,
by
being
*NL*
plundered
of
those
very
effects
which
had
caused
him
to
desert
his
place
*NL*
in
the
ranks
.
The
man
was
of
powerful
frame
,
and
too
avaricious
to
*NL*
part
with
his
goods
without
a
struggle
.
Individuals
from
either
party
*NL*
interfered
;
the
one
side
to
prevent
and
the
other
to
aid
in
the
robbery
.
*NL*
Voices
grew
loud
and
angry
,
and
a
hundred
savages
appeared
,
as
it
were
,
*NL*
by
magic
,
where
a
dozen
only
had
been
seen
a
minute
before
.
It
was
*NL*
then
that
Cora
saw
the
form
of
Magua
gliding
among
his
countrymen
,
and
*NL*
speaking
with
his
fatal
and
artful
eloquence
.
The
mass
of
women
and
*NL*
children
stopped
,
and
hovered
together
like
alarmed
and
fluttering
*NL*
birds
.
But
the
cupidity
of
the
Indian
was
soon
gratified
,
and
the
*NL*
different
bodies
again
moved
slowly
onward
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
savages
now
fell
back
,
and
seemed
content
to
let
their
enemies
*NL*
advance
without
further
molestation
.
But
,
as
the
female
crowd
approached
*NL*
them
,
the
gaudy
colors
of
a
shawl
attracted
the
eyes
of
a
wild
and
*NL*
untutored
Huron
.
He
advanced
to
seize
it
without
the
least
hesitation
.
*NL*
The
woman
,
more
in
terror
than
through
love
of
the
ornament
,
wrapped
her
*NL*
child
in
the
coveted
article
,
and
folded
both
more
closely
to
her
bosom
.
*NL*
Cora
was
in
the
act
of
speaking
,
with
an
intent
to
advise
the
woman
to
*NL*
abandon
the
trifle
,
when
the
savage
relinquished
his
hold
of
the
shawl
,
*NL*
and
tore
the
screaming
infant
from
her
arms
.
Abandoning
everything
*NL*
to
the
greedy
grasp
of
those
around
her
,
the
mother
darted
,
with
*NL*
distraction
in
her
mien
,
to
reclaim
her
child
.
The
Indian
smiled
grimly
,
*NL*
and
extended
one
hand
,
in
sign
of
a
willingness
to
exchange
,
while
,
with
*NL*
the
other
,
he
flourished
the
babe
over
his
head
,
holding
it
by
the
feet
*NL*
as
if
to
enhance
the
value
of
the
ransom
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
--
here
--
there
--
all
--
any
--
everything
!
''
exclaimed
the
breathless
*NL*
woman
,
tearing
the
lighter
articles
of
dress
from
her
person
with
*NL*
ill-directed
and
trembling
fingers
;
``
take
all
,
but
give
me
my
babe
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
savage
spurned
the
worthless
rags
,
and
perceiving
that
the
shawl
*NL*
had
already
become
a
prize
to
another
,
his
bantering
but
sullen
smile
*NL*
changing
to
a
gleam
of
ferocity
,
he
dashed
the
head
of
the
infant
*NL*
against
a
rock
,
and
cast
its
quivering
remains
to
her
very
feet
.
For
an
*NL*
instant
the
mother
stood
,
like
a
statue
of
despair
,
looking
wildly
down
*NL*
at
the
unseemly
object
,
which
had
so
lately
nestled
in
her
bosom
and
*NL*
smiled
in
her
face
;
and
then
she
raised
her
eyes
and
countenance
toward
*NL*
heaven
,
as
if
calling
on
God
to
curse
the
perpetrator
of
the
foul
*NL*
deed
.
She
was
spared
the
sin
of
such
a
prayer
for
,
maddened
at
his
*NL*
disappointment
,
and
excited
at
the
sight
of
blood
,
the
Huron
mercifully
*NL*
drove
his
tomahawk
into
her
own
brain
.
The
mother
sank
under
the
blow
,
*NL*
and
fell
,
grasping
at
her
child
,
in
death
,
with
the
same
engrossing
love
*NL*
that
had
caused
her
to
cherish
it
when
living
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
dangerous
moment
,
Magua
placed
his
hands
to
his
mouth
,
and
*NL*
raised
the
fatal
and
appalling
whoop
.
The
scattered
Indians
started
at
*NL*
the
well-known
cry
,
as
coursers
bound
at
the
signal
to
quit
the
goal
;
*NL*
and
directly
there
arose
such
a
yell
along
the
plain
,
and
through
the
*NL*
arches
of
the
wood
,
as
seldom
burst
from
human
lips
before
.
They
who
*NL*
heard
it
listened
with
a
curdling
horror
at
the
heart
,
little
inferior
*NL*
to
that
dread
which
may
be
expected
to
attend
the
blasts
of
the
final
*NL*
summons
.
*NL*
*NL*
More
than
two
thousand
raving
savages
broke
from
the
forest
at
the
*NL*
signal
,
and
threw
themselves
across
the
fatal
plain
with
instinctive
*NL*
alacrity
.
We
shall
not
dwell
on
the
revolting
horrors
that
succeeded
.
*NL*
Death
was
everywhere
,
and
in
his
most
terrific
and
disgusting
aspects
.
*NL*
Resistance
only
served
to
inflame
the
murderers
,
who
inflicted
their
*NL*
furious
blows
long
after
their
victims
were
beyond
the
power
of
their
*NL*
resentment
.
The
flow
of
blood
might
be
likened
to
the
outbreaking
of
*NL*
a
torrent
;
and
as
the
natives
became
heated
and
maddened
by
the
sight
,
*NL*
many
among
them
even
kneeled
to
the
earth
,
and
drank
freely
,
exultingly
,
*NL*
hellishly
,
of
the
crimson
tide
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
trained
bodies
of
the
troops
threw
themselves
quickly
into
solid
*NL*
masses
,
endeavoring
to
awe
their
assailants
by
the
imposing
appearance
*NL*
of
a
military
front
.
The
experiment
in
some
measure
succeeded
,
though
*NL*
far
too
many
suffered
their
unloaded
muskets
to
be
torn
from
their
*NL*
hands
,
in
the
vain
hope
of
appeasing
the
savages
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
such
a
scene
none
had
leisure
to
note
the
fleeting
moments
.
It
might
*NL*
have
been
ten
minutes
-LRB-
it
seemed
an
age
-RRB-
that
the
sisters
had
stood
*NL*
riveted
to
one
spot
,
horror-stricken
and
nearly
helpless
.
When
the
first
*NL*
blow
was
struck
,
their
screaming
companions
had
pressed
upon
them
in
*NL*
a
body
,
rendering
flight
impossible
;
and
now
that
fear
or
death
had
*NL*
scattered
most
,
if
not
all
,
from
around
them
,
they
saw
no
avenue
open
,
*NL*
but
such
as
conducted
to
the
tomahawks
of
their
foes
.
On
every
side
*NL*
arose
shrieks
,
groans
,
exhortations
and
curses
.
At
this
moment
,
Alice
*NL*
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
vast
form
of
her
father
,
moving
rapidly
across
*NL*
the
plain
,
in
the
direction
of
the
French
army
.
He
was
,
in
truth
,
*NL*
proceeding
to
Montcalm
,
fearless
of
every
danger
,
to
claim
the
tardy
*NL*
escort
for
which
he
had
before
conditioned
.
Fifty
glittering
axes
*NL*
and
barbed
spears
were
offered
unheeded
at
his
life
,
but
the
savages
*NL*
respected
his
rank
and
calmness
,
even
in
their
fury
.
The
dangerous
*NL*
weapons
were
brushed
aside
by
the
still
nervous
arm
of
the
veteran
,
or
*NL*
fell
of
themselves
,
after
menacing
an
act
that
it
would
seem
no
one
had
*NL*
courage
to
perform
.
Fortunately
,
the
vindictive
Magua
was
searching
for
*NL*
his
victim
in
the
very
band
the
veteran
had
just
quitted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Father
--
father
--
we
are
here
!
''
shrieked
Alice
,
as
he
passed
,
at
no
great
*NL*
distance
,
without
appearing
to
heed
them
.
``
Come
to
us
,
father
,
or
we
*NL*
die
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
cry
was
repeated
,
and
in
terms
and
tones
that
might
have
melted
*NL*
a
heart
of
stone
,
but
it
was
unanswered
.
Once
,
indeed
,
the
old
man
*NL*
appeared
to
catch
the
sound
,
for
he
paused
and
listened
;
but
Alice
had
*NL*
dropped
senseless
on
the
earth
,
and
Cora
had
sunk
at
her
side
,
hovering
*NL*
in
untiring
tenderness
over
her
lifeless
form
.
Munro
shook
his
head
in
*NL*
disappointment
,
and
proceeded
,
bent
on
the
high
duty
of
his
station
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lady
,
''
said
Gamut
,
who
,
helpless
and
useless
as
he
was
,
had
not
yet
*NL*
dreamed
of
deserting
his
trust
,
``
it
is
the
jubilee
of
the
devils
,
and
*NL*
this
is
not
a
meet
place
for
Christians
to
tarry
in
.
Let
us
up
and
fly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
,
''
said
Cora
,
still
gazing
at
her
unconscious
sister
;
``
save
thyself
.
*NL*
To
me
thou
canst
not
be
of
further
use
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
David
comprehended
the
unyielding
character
of
her
resolution
,
by
the
*NL*
simple
but
expressive
gesture
that
accompanied
her
words
.
He
gazed
for
a
*NL*
moment
at
the
dusky
forms
that
were
acting
their
hellish
rites
on
every
*NL*
side
of
him
,
and
his
tall
person
grew
more
erect
while
his
chest
heaved
,
*NL*
and
every
feature
swelled
,
and
seemed
to
speak
with
the
power
of
the
*NL*
feelings
by
which
he
was
governed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
the
Jewish
boy
might
tame
the
great
spirit
of
Saul
by
the
sound
of
*NL*
his
harp
,
and
the
words
of
sacred
song
,
it
may
not
be
amiss
,
''
he
said
,
*NL*
``
to
try
the
potency
of
music
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
raising
his
voice
to
its
highest
tone
,
he
poured
out
a
strain
so
*NL*
powerful
as
to
be
heard
even
amid
the
din
of
that
bloody
field
.
More
*NL*
than
one
savage
rushed
toward
them
,
thinking
to
rifle
the
unprotected
*NL*
sisters
of
their
attire
,
and
bear
away
their
scalps
;
but
when
they
found
*NL*
this
strange
and
unmoved
figure
riveted
to
his
post
,
they
paused
to
*NL*
listen
.
Astonishment
soon
changed
to
admiration
,
and
they
passed
on
to
*NL*
other
and
less
courageous
victims
,
openly
expressing
their
satisfaction
*NL*
at
the
firmness
with
which
the
white
warrior
sang
his
death
song
.
*NL*
Encouraged
and
deluded
by
his
success
,
David
exerted
all
his
powers
to
*NL*
extend
what
he
believed
so
holy
an
influence
.
The
unwonted
sounds
caught
*NL*
the
ears
of
a
distant
savage
,
who
flew
raging
from
group
to
group
,
like
*NL*
one
who
,
scorning
to
touch
the
vulgar
herd
,
hunted
for
some
victim
more
*NL*
worthy
of
his
renown
.
It
was
Magua
,
who
uttered
a
yell
of
pleasure
when
*NL*
he
beheld
his
ancient
prisoners
again
at
his
mercy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
''
he
said
,
laying
his
soiled
hands
on
the
dress
of
Cora
,
``
the
*NL*
wigwam
of
the
Huron
is
still
open
.
Is
it
not
better
than
this
place
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Away
!
''
cried
Cora
,
veiling
her
eyes
from
his
revolting
aspect
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Indian
laughed
tauntingly
,
as
he
held
up
his
reeking
hand
,
and
*NL*
answered
:
``
It
is
red
,
but
it
comes
from
white
veins
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monster
!
there
is
blood
,
oceans
of
blood
,
upon
thy
soul
;
thy
spirit
has
*NL*
moved
this
scene
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Magua
is
a
great
chief
!
''
returned
the
exulting
savage
,
``
will
the
*NL*
dark-hair
go
to
his
tribe
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
!
strike
if
thou
wilt
,
and
complete
thy
revenge
.
''
He
hesitated
a
*NL*
moment
,
and
then
catching
the
light
and
senseless
form
of
Alice
in
his
*NL*
arms
,
the
subtle
Indian
moved
swiftly
across
the
plain
toward
the
woods
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hold
!
''
shrieked
Cora
,
following
wildly
on
his
footsteps
;
``
release
the
*NL*
child
!
wretch
!
what
is
'
t
you
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Magua
was
deaf
to
her
voice
;
or
,
rather
,
he
knew
his
power
,
and
was
*NL*
determined
to
maintain
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stay
--
lady
--
stay
,
''
called
Gamut
,
after
the
unconscious
Cora
.
``
The
*NL*
holy
charm
is
beginning
to
be
felt
,
and
soon
shalt
thou
see
this
horrid
*NL*
tumult
stilled
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Perceiving
that
,
in
his
turn
,
he
was
unheeded
,
the
faithful
David
*NL*
followed
the
distracted
sister
,
raising
his
voice
again
in
sacred
song
,
*NL*
and
sweeping
the
air
to
the
measure
,
with
his
long
arm
,
in
diligent
*NL*
accompaniment
.
In
this
manner
they
traversed
the
plain
,
through
the
*NL*
flying
,
the
wounded
and
the
dead
.
The
fierce
Huron
was
,
at
any
time
,
*NL*
sufficient
for
himself
and
the
victim
that
he
bore
;
though
Cora
would
*NL*
have
fallen
more
than
once
under
the
blows
of
her
savage
enemies
,
*NL*
but
for
the
extraordinary
being
who
stalked
in
her
rear
,
and
who
now
*NL*
appeared
to
the
astonished
natives
gifted
with
the
protecting
spirit
of
*NL*
madness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Magua
,
who
knew
how
to
avoid
the
more
pressing
dangers
,
and
also
to
*NL*
elude
pursuit
,
entered
the
woods
through
a
low
ravine
,
where
he
quickly
*NL*
found
the
Narragansetts
,
which
the
travelers
had
abandoned
so
shortly
*NL*
before
,
awaiting
his
appearance
,
in
custody
of
a
savage
as
fierce
and
*NL*
malign
in
his
expression
as
himself
.
Laying
Alice
on
one
of
the
horses
,
*NL*
he
made
a
sign
to
Cora
to
mount
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
Notwithstanding
the
horror
excited
by
the
presence
of
her
captor
,
there
*NL*
was
a
present
relief
in
escaping
from
the
bloody
scene
enacting
on
the
*NL*
plain
,
to
which
Cora
could
not
be
altogether
insensible
.
She
took
her
*NL*
seat
,
and
held
forth
her
arms
for
her
sister
,
with
an
air
of
entreaty
*NL*
and
love
that
even
the
Huron
could
not
deny
.
Placing
Alice
,
then
,
on
the
*NL*
same
animal
with
Cora
,
he
seized
the
bridle
,
and
commenced
his
route
*NL*
by
plunging
deeper
into
the
forest
.
David
,
perceiving
that
he
was
left
*NL*
alone
,
utterly
disregarded
as
a
subject
too
worthless
even
to
destroy
,
*NL*
threw
his
long
limb
across
the
saddle
of
the
beast
they
had
deserted
,
*NL*
and
made
such
progress
in
the
pursuit
as
the
difficulties
of
the
path
*NL*
permitted
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
soon
began
to
ascend
;
but
as
the
motion
had
a
tendency
to
revive
*NL*
the
dormant
faculties
of
her
sister
,
the
attention
of
Cora
was
too
much
*NL*
divided
between
the
tenderest
solicitude
in
her
behalf
,
and
in
listening
*NL*
to
the
cries
which
were
still
too
audible
on
the
plain
,
to
note
the
*NL*
direction
in
which
they
journeyed
.
When
,
however
,
they
gained
the
*NL*
flattened
surface
of
the
mountain-top
,
and
approached
the
eastern
*NL*
precipice
,
she
recognized
the
spot
to
which
she
had
once
before
been
led
*NL*
under
the
more
friendly
auspices
of
the
scout
.
Here
Magua
suffered
them
*NL*
to
dismount
;
and
notwithstanding
their
own
captivity
,
the
curiosity
*NL*
which
seems
inseparable
from
horror
,
induced
them
to
gaze
at
the
*NL*
sickening
sight
below
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cruel
work
was
still
unchecked
.
On
every
side
the
captured
were
*NL*
flying
before
their
relentless
persecutors
,
while
the
armed
columns
*NL*
of
the
Christian
king
stood
fast
in
an
apathy
which
has
never
been
*NL*
explained
,
and
which
has
left
an
immovable
blot
on
the
otherwise
fair
*NL*
escutcheon
of
their
leader
.
Nor
was
the
sword
of
death
stayed
until
*NL*
cupidity
got
the
mastery
of
revenge
.
Then
,
indeed
,
the
shrieks
of
the
*NL*
wounded
,
and
the
yells
of
their
murderers
grew
less
frequent
,
until
,
*NL*
finally
,
the
cries
of
horror
were
lost
to
their
ear
,
or
were
drowned
in
*NL*
the
loud
,
long
and
piercing
whoops
of
the
triumphant
savages
.

Othello
*NL*
*NL*
The
bloody
and
inhuman
scene
rather
incidentally
mentioned
than
*NL*
described
in
the
preceding
chapter
,
is
conspicuous
in
the
pages
of
*NL*
colonial
history
by
the
merited
title
of
``
The
Massacre
of
William
*NL*
Henry
.
''
It
so
far
deepened
the
stain
which
a
previous
and
very
similar
*NL*
event
had
left
upon
the
reputation
of
the
French
commander
that
it
was
*NL*
not
entirely
erased
by
his
early
and
glorious
death
.
It
is
now
becoming
*NL*
obscured
by
time
;
and
thousands
,
who
know
that
Montcalm
died
like
a
hero
*NL*
on
the
plains
of
Abraham
,
have
yet
to
learn
how
much
he
was
deficient
in
*NL*
that
moral
courage
without
which
no
man
can
be
truly
great
.
Pages
might
*NL*
yet
be
written
to
prove
,
from
this
illustrious
example
,
the
defects
of
*NL*
human
excellence
;
to
show
how
easy
it
is
for
generous
sentiments
,
high
*NL*
courtesy
,
and
chivalrous
courage
to
lose
their
influence
beneath
the
*NL*
chilling
blight
of
selfishness
,
and
to
exhibit
to
the
world
a
man
who
*NL*
was
great
in
all
the
minor
attributes
of
character
,
but
who
was
found
*NL*
wanting
when
it
became
necessary
to
prove
how
much
principle
is
superior
*NL*
to
policy
.
But
the
task
would
exceed
our
prerogatives
;
and
,
as
history
,
*NL*
like
love
,
is
so
apt
to
surround
her
heroes
with
an
atmosphere
of
*NL*
imaginary
brightness
,
it
is
probable
that
Louis
de
Saint
Veran
will
be
*NL*
viewed
by
posterity
only
as
the
gallant
defender
of
his
country
,
while
*NL*
his
cruel
apathy
on
the
shores
of
the
Oswego
and
of
the
Horican
will
be
*NL*
forgotten
.
Deeply
regretting
this
weakness
on
the
part
of
a
sister
muse
,
*NL*
we
shall
at
once
retire
from
her
sacred
precincts
,
within
the
proper
*NL*
limits
of
our
own
humble
vocation
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
third
day
from
the
capture
of
the
fort
was
drawing
to
a
close
,
but
*NL*
the
business
of
the
narrative
must
still
detain
the
reader
on
the
shores
*NL*
of
the
``
holy
lake
.
''
When
last
seen
,
the
environs
of
the
works
were
*NL*
filled
with
violence
and
uproar
.
They
were
now
possessed
by
stillness
*NL*
and
death
.
The
blood-stained
conquerors
had
departed
;
and
their
camp
,
*NL*
which
had
so
lately
rung
with
the
merry
rejoicings
of
a
victorious
army
,
*NL*
lay
a
silent
and
deserted
city
of
huts
.
The
fortress
was
a
smoldering
*NL*
ruin
;
charred
rafters
,
fragments
of
exploded
artillery
,
and
rent
*NL*
mason-work
covering
its
earthen
mounds
in
confused
disorder
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
frightful
change
had
also
occurred
in
the
season
.
The
sun
had
hid
*NL*
its
warmth
behind
an
impenetrable
mass
of
vapor
,
and
hundreds
of
human
*NL*
forms
,
which
had
blackened
beneath
the
fierce
heats
of
August
,
were
*NL*
stiffening
in
their
deformity
before
the
blasts
of
a
premature
November
.
*NL*
The
curling
and
spotless
mists
,
which
had
been
seen
sailing
above
the
*NL*
hills
toward
the
north
,
were
now
returning
in
an
interminable
dusky
*NL*
sheet
,
that
was
urged
along
by
the
fury
of
a
tempest
.
The
crowded
mirror
*NL*
of
the
Horican
was
gone
;
and
,
in
its
place
,
the
green
and
angry
waters
*NL*
lashed
the
shores
,
as
if
indignantly
casting
back
its
impurities
to
*NL*
the
polluted
strand
.
Still
the
clear
fountain
retained
a
portion
of
its
*NL*
charmed
influence
,
but
it
reflected
only
the
somber
gloom
that
fell
*NL*
from
the
impending
heavens
.
That
humid
and
congenial
atmosphere
which
*NL*
commonly
adorned
the
view
,
veiling
its
harshness
,
and
softening
its
*NL*
asperities
,
had
disappeared
,
the
northern
air
poured
across
the
waste
of
*NL*
water
so
harsh
and
unmingled
,
that
nothing
was
left
to
be
conjectured
by
*NL*
the
eye
,
or
fashioned
by
the
fancy
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
fiercer
element
had
cropped
the
verdure
of
the
plain
,
which
looked
*NL*
as
though
it
were
scathed
by
the
consuming
lightning
.
But
,
here
and
*NL*
there
,
a
dark
green
tuft
rose
in
the
midst
of
the
desolation
;
the
*NL*
earliest
fruits
of
a
soil
that
had
been
fattened
with
human
blood
.
*NL*
The
whole
landscape
,
which
,
seen
by
a
favoring
light
,
and
in
a
genial
*NL*
temperature
,
had
been
found
so
lovely
,
appeared
now
like
some
pictured
*NL*
allegory
of
life
,
in
which
objects
were
arrayed
in
their
harshest
but
*NL*
truest
colors
,
and
without
the
relief
of
any
shadowing
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
solitary
and
arid
blades
of
grass
arose
from
the
passing
gusts
*NL*
fearfully
perceptible
;
the
bold
and
rocky
mountains
were
too
distinct
in
*NL*
their
barrenness
,
and
the
eye
even
sought
relief
,
in
vain
,
by
attempting
*NL*
to
pierce
the
illimitable
void
of
heaven
,
which
was
shut
to
its
gaze
by
*NL*
the
dusky
sheet
of
ragged
and
driving
vapor
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
wind
blew
unequally
;
sometimes
sweeping
heavily
along
the
ground
,
*NL*
seeming
to
whisper
its
moanings
in
the
cold
ears
of
the
dead
,
then
*NL*
rising
in
a
shrill
and
mournful
whistling
,
it
entered
the
forest
with
*NL*
a
rush
that
filled
the
air
with
the
leaves
and
branches
it
scattered
in
*NL*
its
path
.
Amid
the
unnatural
shower
,
a
few
hungry
ravens
struggled
with
*NL*
the
gale
;
but
no
sooner
was
the
green
ocean
of
woods
which
stretched
*NL*
beneath
them
,
passed
,
than
they
gladly
stopped
,
at
random
,
to
their
*NL*
hideous
banquet
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
short
,
it
was
a
scene
of
wildness
and
desolation
;
and
it
appeared
as
*NL*
if
all
who
had
profanely
entered
it
had
been
stricken
,
at
a
blow
,
by
*NL*
the
relentless
arm
of
death
.
But
the
prohibition
had
ceased
;
and
for
the
*NL*
first
time
since
the
perpetrators
of
those
foul
deeds
which
had
assisted
*NL*
to
disfigure
the
scene
were
gone
,
living
human
beings
had
now
presumed
*NL*
to
approach
the
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
an
hour
before
the
setting
of
the
sun
,
on
the
day
already
*NL*
mentioned
,
the
forms
of
five
men
might
have
been
seen
issuing
from
the
*NL*
narrow
vista
of
trees
,
where
the
path
to
the
Hudson
entered
the
forest
,
*NL*
and
advancing
in
the
direction
of
the
ruined
works
.
At
first
their
*NL*
progress
was
slow
and
guarded
,
as
though
they
entered
with
reluctance
*NL*
amid
the
horrors
of
the
post
,
or
dreaded
the
renewal
of
its
frightful
*NL*
incidents
.
A
light
figure
preceded
the
rest
of
the
party
,
with
*NL*
the
caution
and
activity
of
a
native
;
ascending
every
hillock
to
*NL*
reconnoiter
,
and
indicating
by
gestures
,
to
his
companions
,
the
route
he
*NL*
deemed
it
most
prudent
to
pursue
.
Nor
were
those
in
the
rear
wanting
in
*NL*
every
caution
and
foresight
known
to
forest
warfare
.
One
among
them
,
he
*NL*
also
was
an
Indian
,
moved
a
little
on
one
flank
,
and
watched
the
margin
*NL*
of
the
woods
,
with
eyes
long
accustomed
to
read
the
smallest
sign
*NL*
of
danger
.
The
remaining
three
were
white
,
though
clad
in
vestments
*NL*
adapted
,
both
in
quality
and
color
,
to
their
present
hazardous
*NL*
pursuit
--
that
of
hanging
on
the
skirts
of
a
retiring
army
in
the
*NL*
wilderness
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
effects
produced
by
the
appalling
sights
that
constantly
arose
in
*NL*
their
path
to
the
lake
shore
,
were
as
different
as
the
characters
of
the
*NL*
respective
individuals
who
composed
the
party
.
The
youth
in
front
*NL*
threw
serious
but
furtive
glances
at
the
mangled
victims
,
as
he
stepped
*NL*
lightly
across
the
plain
,
afraid
to
exhibit
his
feelings
,
and
yet
too
*NL*
inexperienced
to
quell
entirely
their
sudden
and
powerful
influence
.
His
*NL*
red
associate
,
however
,
was
superior
to
such
a
weakness
.
He
passed
the
*NL*
groups
of
dead
with
a
steadiness
of
purpose
,
and
an
eye
so
calm
,
that
*NL*
nothing
but
long
and
inveterate
practise
could
enable
him
to
maintain
.
*NL*
The
sensations
produced
in
the
minds
of
even
the
white
men
were
*NL*
different
,
though
uniformly
sorrowful
.
One
,
whose
gray
locks
and
*NL*
furrowed
lineaments
,
blending
with
a
martial
air
and
tread
,
betrayed
,
in
*NL*
spite
of
the
disguise
of
a
woodsman
's
dress
,
a
man
long
experienced
in
*NL*
scenes
of
war
,
was
not
ashamed
to
groan
aloud
,
whenever
a
spectacle
of
*NL*
more
than
usual
horror
came
under
his
view
.
The
young
man
at
his
elbow
*NL*
shuddered
,
but
seemed
to
suppress
his
feelings
in
tenderness
to
his
*NL*
companion
.
Of
them
all
,
the
straggler
who
brought
up
the
rear
appeared
*NL*
alone
to
betray
his
real
thoughts
,
without
fear
of
observation
or
dread
*NL*
of
consequences
.
He
gazed
at
the
most
appalling
sight
with
eyes
and
*NL*
muscles
that
knew
not
how
to
waver
,
but
with
execrations
so
bitter
and
*NL*
deep
as
to
denote
how
much
he
denounced
the
crime
of
his
enemies
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
reader
will
perceive
at
once
,
in
these
respective
characters
,
the
*NL*
Mohicans
,
and
their
white
friend
,
the
scout
;
together
with
Munro
and
*NL*
Heyward
.
It
was
,
in
truth
,
the
father
in
quest
of
his
children
,
attended
*NL*
by
the
youth
who
felt
so
deep
a
stake
in
their
happiness
,
and
those
*NL*
brave
and
trusty
foresters
,
who
had
already
proved
their
skill
and
*NL*
fidelity
through
the
trying
scenes
related
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Uncas
,
who
moved
in
front
,
had
reached
the
center
of
the
plain
,
he
*NL*
raised
a
cry
that
drew
his
companions
in
a
body
to
the
spot
.
The
young
*NL*
warrior
had
halted
over
a
group
of
females
who
lay
in
a
cluster
,
a
*NL*
confused
mass
of
dead
.
Notwithstanding
the
revolting
horror
of
*NL*
the
exhibition
,
Munro
and
Heyward
flew
toward
the
festering
heap
,
*NL*
endeavoring
,
with
a
love
that
no
unseemliness
could
extinguish
,
to
*NL*
discover
whether
any
vestiges
of
those
they
sought
were
to
be
seen
among
*NL*
the
tattered
and
many-colored
garments
.
The
father
and
the
lover
*NL*
found
instant
relief
in
the
search
;
though
each
was
condemned
again
*NL*
to
experience
the
misery
of
an
uncertainty
that
was
hardly
less
*NL*
insupportable
than
the
most
revolting
truth
.
They
were
standing
,
silent
*NL*
and
thoughtful
,
around
the
melancholy
pile
,
when
the
scout
approached
.
*NL*
Eyeing
the
sad
spectacle
with
an
angry
countenance
,
the
sturdy
woodsman
,
*NL*
for
the
first
time
since
his
entering
the
plain
,
spoke
intelligibly
and
*NL*
aloud
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
been
on
many
a
shocking
field
,
and
have
followed
a
trail
of
*NL*
blood
for
weary
miles
,
''
he
said
,
``
but
never
have
I
found
the
hand
of
the
*NL*
devil
so
plain
as
it
is
here
to
be
seen
!
Revenge
is
an
Indian
feeling
,
*NL*
and
all
who
know
me
know
that
there
is
no
cross
in
my
veins
;
but
this
*NL*
much
will
I
say
--
here
,
in
the
face
of
heaven
,
and
with
the
power
of
the
*NL*
Lord
so
manifest
in
this
howling
wilderness
--
that
should
these
Frenchers
*NL*
ever
trust
themselves
again
within
the
range
of
a
ragged
bullet
,
there
*NL*
is
one
rifle
which
shall
play
its
part
so
long
as
flint
will
fire
or
*NL*
powder
burn
!
I
leave
the
tomahawk
and
knife
to
such
as
have
a
natural
*NL*
gift
to
use
them
.
What
say
you
,
Chingachgook
,
''
he
added
,
in
Delaware
;
*NL*
``
shall
the
Hurons
boast
of
this
to
their
women
when
the
deep
snows
*NL*
come
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
gleam
of
resentment
flashed
across
the
dark
lineaments
of
the
Mohican
*NL*
chief
;
he
loosened
his
knife
in
his
sheath
;
and
then
turning
calmly
from
*NL*
the
sight
,
his
countenance
settled
into
a
repose
as
deep
as
if
he
knew
*NL*
the
instigation
of
passion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Montcalm
!
Montcalm
!
''
continued
the
deeply
resentful
and
less
*NL*
self-restrained
scout
;
``
they
say
a
time
must
come
when
all
the
deeds
*NL*
done
in
the
flesh
will
be
seen
at
a
single
look
;
and
that
by
eyes
*NL*
cleared
from
mortal
infirmities
.
Woe
betide
the
wretch
who
is
born
to
*NL*
behold
this
plain
,
with
the
judgment
hanging
about
his
soul
!
Ha
--
as
I
*NL*
am
a
man
of
white
blood
,
yonder
lies
a
red-skin
,
without
the
hair
of
*NL*
his
head
where
nature
rooted
it
!
Look
to
him
,
Delaware
;
it
may
be
one
of
*NL*
your
missing
people
;
and
he
should
have
burial
like
a
stout
warrior
.
*NL*
I
see
it
in
your
eye
,
Sagamore
;
a
Huron
pays
for
this
,
afore
the
fall
*NL*
winds
have
blown
away
the
scent
of
the
blood
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Chingachgook
approached
the
mutilated
form
,
and
,
turning
it
over
,
he
*NL*
found
the
distinguishing
marks
of
one
of
those
six
allied
tribes
,
or
*NL*
nations
,
as
they
were
called
,
who
,
while
they
fought
in
the
English
*NL*
ranks
,
were
so
deadly
hostile
to
his
own
people
.
Spurning
the
loathsome
*NL*
object
with
his
foot
,
he
turned
from
it
with
the
same
indifference
he
*NL*
would
have
quitted
a
brute
carcass
.
The
scout
comprehended
the
action
,
*NL*
and
very
deliberately
pursued
his
own
way
,
continuing
,
however
,
his
*NL*
denunciations
against
the
French
commander
in
the
same
resentful
strain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
but
vast
wisdom
and
unlimited
power
should
dare
to
sweep
off
*NL*
men
in
multitudes
,
''
he
added
;
``
for
it
is
only
the
one
that
can
know
the
*NL*
necessity
of
the
judgment
;
and
what
is
there
,
short
of
the
other
,
that
*NL*
can
replace
the
creatures
of
the
Lord
?
I
hold
it
a
sin
to
kill
the
*NL*
second
buck
afore
the
first
is
eaten
,
unless
a
march
in
front
,
or
*NL*
an
ambushment
,
be
contemplated
.
It
is
a
different
matter
with
a
few
*NL*
warriors
in
open
and
rugged
fight
,
for
't
is
their
gift
to
die
with
the
*NL*
rifle
or
the
tomahawk
in
hand
;
according
as
their
natures
may
happen
to
*NL*
be
,
white
or
red
.
Uncas
,
come
this
way
,
lad
,
and
let
the
ravens
settle
*NL*
upon
the
Mingo
.
I
know
,
from
often
seeing
it
,
that
they
have
a
craving
*NL*
for
the
flesh
of
an
Oneida
;
and
it
is
as
well
to
let
the
bird
follow
the
*NL*
gift
of
its
natural
appetite
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hugh
!
''
exclaimed
the
young
Mohican
,
rising
on
the
extremities
of
his
*NL*
feet
,
and
gazing
intently
in
his
front
,
frightening
the
ravens
to
some
*NL*
other
prey
by
the
sound
and
the
action
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
,
boy
?
''
whispered
the
scout
,
lowering
his
tall
form
into
a
*NL*
crouching
attitude
,
like
a
panther
about
to
take
his
leap
;
``
God
send
it
*NL*
be
a
tardy
Frencher
,
skulking
for
plunder
.
I
do
believe
`
killdeer
'
would
*NL*
take
an
uncommon
range
today
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Uncas
,
without
making
any
reply
,
bounded
away
from
the
spot
,
and
in
the
*NL*
next
instant
he
was
seen
tearing
from
a
bush
,
and
waving
in
triumph
,
a
*NL*
fragment
of
the
green
riding-veil
of
Cora
.
The
movement
,
the
exhibition
,
*NL*
and
the
cry
which
again
burst
from
the
lips
of
the
young
Mohican
,
*NL*
instantly
drew
the
whole
party
about
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
child
!
''
said
Munro
,
speaking
quickly
and
wildly
;
``
give
me
my
child
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Uncas
will
try
,
''
was
the
short
and
touching
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
simple
but
meaning
assurance
was
lost
on
the
father
,
who
seized
*NL*
the
piece
of
gauze
,
and
crushed
it
in
his
hand
,
while
his
eyes
roamed
*NL*
fearfully
among
the
bushes
,
as
if
he
equally
dreaded
and
hoped
for
the
*NL*
secrets
they
might
reveal
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
are
no
dead
,
''
said
Heyward
;
``
the
storm
seems
not
to
have
passed
*NL*
this
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
manifest
;
and
clearer
than
the
heavens
above
our
heads
,
''
*NL*
returned
the
undisturbed
scout
;
``
but
either
she
,
or
they
that
have
*NL*
robbed
her
,
have
passed
the
bush
;
for
I
remember
the
rag
she
wore
to
*NL*
hide
a
face
that
all
did
love
to
look
upon
.
Uncas
,
you
are
right
;
the
*NL*
dark-hair
has
been
here
,
and
she
has
fled
like
a
frightened
fawn
,
to
the
*NL*
wood
;
none
who
could
fly
would
remain
to
be
murdered
.
Let
us
search
*NL*
for
the
marks
she
left
;
for
,
to
Indian
eyes
,
I
sometimes
think
a
*NL*
humming-bird
leaves
his
trail
in
the
air
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
Mohican
darted
away
at
the
suggestion
,
and
the
scout
had
*NL*
hardly
done
speaking
,
before
the
former
raised
a
cry
of
success
from
the
*NL*
margin
of
the
forest
.
On
reaching
the
spot
,
the
anxious
party
perceived
*NL*
another
portion
of
the
veil
fluttering
on
the
lower
branch
of
a
beech
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Softly
,
softly
,
''
said
the
scout
,
extending
his
long
rifle
in
front
of
*NL*
the
eager
Heyward
;
``
we
now
know
our
work
,
but
the
beauty
of
the
trail
*NL*
must
not
be
deformed
.
A
step
too
soon
may
give
us
hours
of
trouble
.
We
*NL*
have
them
,
though
;
that
much
is
beyond
denial
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bless
ye
,
bless
ye
,
worthy
man
!
''
exclaimed
Munro
;
``
whither
then
,
have
*NL*
they
fled
,
and
where
are
my
babes
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
path
they
have
taken
depends
on
many
chances
.
If
they
have
gone
*NL*
alone
,
they
are
quite
as
likely
to
move
in
a
circle
as
straight
,
and
*NL*
they
may
be
within
a
dozen
miles
of
us
;
but
if
the
Hurons
,
or
any
of
the
*NL*
French
Indians
,
have
laid
hands
on
them
,
't
is
probably
they
are
now
*NL*
near
the
borders
of
the
Canadas
.
But
what
matters
that
?
''
continued
the
*NL*
deliberate
scout
,
observing
the
powerful
anxiety
and
disappointment
*NL*
the
listeners
exhibited
;
``
here
are
the
Mohicans
and
I
on
one
end
of
*NL*
the
trail
,
and
,
rely
on
it
,
we
find
the
other
,
though
they
should
be
a
*NL*
hundred
leagues
asunder
!
Gently
,
gently
,
Uncas
,
you
are
as
impatient
*NL*
as
a
man
in
the
settlements
;
you
forget
that
light
feet
leave
but
faint
*NL*
marks
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hugh
!
''
exclaimed
Chingachgook
,
who
had
been
occupied
in
examining
an
*NL*
opening
that
had
been
evidently
made
through
the
low
underbrush
which
*NL*
skirted
the
forest
;
and
who
now
stood
erect
,
as
he
pointed
downward
,
in
*NL*
the
attitude
and
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
beheld
a
disgusting
serpent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
is
the
palpable
impression
of
the
footstep
of
a
man
,
''
cried
*NL*
Heyward
,
bending
over
the
indicated
spot
;
``
he
has
trod
in
the
margin
of
*NL*
this
pool
,
and
the
mark
can
not
be
mistaken
.
They
are
captives
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Better
so
than
left
to
starve
in
the
wilderness
,
''
returned
the
scout
;
*NL*
``
and
they
will
leave
a
wider
trail
.
I
would
wager
fifty
beaver
skins
*NL*
against
as
many
flints
,
that
the
Mohicans
and
I
enter
their
wigwams
*NL*
within
the
month
!
Stoop
to
it
,
Uncas
,
and
try
what
you
can
make
of
the
*NL*
moccasin
;
for
moccasin
it
plainly
is
,
and
no
shoe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
Mohican
bent
over
the
track
,
and
removing
the
scattered
leaves
*NL*
from
around
the
place
,
he
examined
it
with
much
of
that
sort
of
scrutiny
*NL*
that
a
money
dealer
,
in
these
days
of
pecuniary
doubts
,
would
bestow
on
*NL*
a
suspected
due-bill
.
At
length
he
arose
from
his
knees
,
satisfied
with
*NL*
the
result
of
the
examination
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
boy
,
''
demanded
the
attentive
scout
;
``
what
does
it
say
?
Can
you
*NL*
make
anything
of
the
tell-tale
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Le
Renard
Subtil
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ha
!
that
rampaging
devil
again
!
there
will
never
be
an
end
of
his
*NL*
loping
till
`
killdeer
'
has
said
a
friendly
word
to
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Heyward
reluctantly
admitted
the
truth
of
this
intelligence
,
and
now
*NL*
expressed
rather
his
hopes
than
his
doubts
by
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
moccasin
is
so
much
like
another
,
it
is
probable
there
is
some
*NL*
mistake
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
moccasin
like
another
!
you
may
as
well
say
that
one
foot
is
like
*NL*
another
;
though
we
all
know
that
some
are
long
,
and
others
short
;
some
*NL*
broad
and
others
narrow
;
some
with
high
,
and
some
with
low
insteps
;
some
*NL*
intoed
,
and
some
out
.
One
moccasin
is
no
more
like
another
than
one
book
*NL*
is
like
another
:
though
they
who
can
read
in
one
are
seldom
able
to
tell
*NL*
the
marks
of
the
other
.
Which
is
all
ordered
for
the
best
,
giving
to
*NL*
every
man
his
natural
advantages
.
Let
me
get
down
to
it
,
Uncas
;
neither
*NL*
book
nor
moccasin
is
the
worse
for
having
two
opinions
,
instead
of
one
.
''
*NL*
The
scout
stooped
to
the
task
,
and
instantly
added
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
right
,
boy
;
here
is
the
patch
we
saw
so
often
in
the
other
*NL*
chase

And
the
fellow
will
drink
when
he
can
get
an
opportunity
;
your
*NL*
drinking
Indian
always
learns
to
walk
with
a
wider
toe
than
the
natural
*NL*
savage
,
it
being
the
gift
of
a
drunkard
to
straddle
,
whether
of
white
or
*NL*
red
skin

'T
is
just
the
length
and
breadth
,
too

look
at
it

you
measured
the
prints
more
than
once
,
when
we
hunted
the
varmints
from
*NL*
Glenn
's
to
the
health
springs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Chingachgook
complied
;
and
after
finishing
his
short
examination
,
he
*NL*
arose
,
and
with
a
quiet
demeanor
,
he
merely
pronounced
the
word
:

``
Magua
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
't
is
a
settled

have
passed
the
dark-hair
and

Magua

*NL*
*NL*
``

demanded
Heyward
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
her
we
have
not
yet
seen
the
signs
,
''
returned
the
scout
,
looking
*NL*
closely
around
at
the
trees
,
the
bushes
and
the
ground
.
``
What
have
*NL*
we
there
?
Uncas
,
bring
hither
the
thing
you
see
dangling
from
yonder
*NL*
thorn-bush
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
Indian
had
complied
,
the
scout
received
the
prize
,
and
holding
*NL*
it
on
high
,
he
laughed
in
his
silent
but
heartfelt
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
the
tooting
we
`
pon
of
the
singer
!
now
we
shall
have
a
trail
a
*NL*
priest
might
travel
,
''
he
said
.
``
Uncas
,
look
for
the
marks
of
a
shoe
that
*NL*
is
long
enough
to
uphold
six
feet
two
of
tottering
human
flesh
.
I
begin
*NL*
to
have
some
hopes
of
the
fellow
,
since
he
has
given
up
squalling
to
*NL*
follow
some
better
trade
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
least
he
has
been
faithful
to
his
trust
,
''
said
Heyward
.
``
And
Cora
*NL*
and
Alice
are
not
without
a
friend
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Hawkeye
,
dropping
his
rifle
,
and
leaning
on
it
with
an
air
*NL*
of
visible
contempt
,
``
he
will
do
their
singing
.
Can
he
slay
a
buck
for
*NL*
their
dinner
;
journey
by
the
moss
on
the
beeches
,
or
cut
the
throat
of
*NL*
a
Huron
?
If
not
,
the
first
catbird
*
he
meets
is
the
cleverer
of
the
two
.
*NL*
Well
,
boy
,
any
signs
of
such
a
foundation
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
*
The
powers
of
the
American
mocking-bird
are
generally
*NL*
known
.
But
the
true
mocking-bird
is
not
found
so
far
north
*NL*
as
the
state
of
New
York
,
where
it
has
,
however
,
two
*NL*
substitutes
of
inferior
excellence
,
the
catbird
,
so
often
*NL*
named
by
the
scout
,
and
the
bird
vulgarly
called
ground
-
*NL*
thresher
.
Either
of
these
last
two
birds
is
superior
to
the
*NL*
nightingale
or
the
lark
,
though
,
in
general
,
the
American
*NL*
birds
are
less
musical
than
those
of
Europe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
is
something
like
the
footstep
of
one
who
has
worn
a
shoe
;
can
it
*NL*
be
that
of
our
friend
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Touch
the
leaves
lightly
or
you
'll
disconsart
the
formation
.
That
!
that
*NL*
is
the
print
of
a
foot
,
but
't
is
the
dark-hair
's
;
and
small
it
is
,
too
,
*NL*
for
one
of
such
a
noble
height
and
grand
appearance
.
The
singer
would
*NL*
cover
it
with
his
heel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
!
let
me
look
on
the
footsteps
of
my
child
,
''
said
Munro
,
shoving
*NL*
the
bushes
aside
,
and
bending
fondly
over
the
nearly
obliterated
*NL*
impression
.
Though
the
tread
which
had
left
the
mark
had
been
light
and
*NL*
rapid
,
it
was
still
plainly
visible
.
The
aged
soldier
examined
it
with
*NL*
eyes
that
grew
dim
as
he
gazed
;
nor
did
he
rise
from
this
stooping
*NL*
posture
until
Heyward
saw
that
he
had
watered
the
trace
of
his
*NL*
daughter
's
passage
with
a
scalding
tear
.
Willing
to
divert
a
distress
*NL*
which
threatened
each
moment
to
break
through
the
restraint
of
*NL*
appearances
,
by
giving
the
veteran
something
to
do
,
the
young
man
said
*NL*
to
the
scout
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
we
now
possess
these
infallible
signs
,
let
us
commence
our
march
.
A
*NL*
moment
,
at
such
a
time
,
will
appear
an
age
to
the
captives
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
not
the
swiftest
leaping
deer
that
gives
the
longest
chase
,
''
*NL*
returned
Hawkeye
,
without
moving
his
eyes
from
the
different
marks
that
*NL*
had
come
under
his
view
;
``
we
know
that
the
rampaging
Huron
has
passed
,
*NL*
and
the
dark-hair
,
and
the
singer
,
but
where
is
she
of
the
yellow
locks
*NL*
and
blue
eyes
?
Though
little
,
and
far
from
being
as
bold
as
her
sister
,
*NL*
she
is
fair
to
the
view
,
and
pleasant
in
discourse
.
Has
she
no
friend
,
*NL*
that
none
care
for
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
forbid
she
should
ever
want
hundreds
!
Are
we
not
now
in
her

pursuit
?
For
one
,
I
will
never
cease
the
search
till
she
be
found
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
that
case
we
may
have
to
journey
by
different
paths
;
for
here
she
*NL*
has
not
passed
,
light
and
little
as
her
footsteps
would
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Heyward
drew
back
,
all
his
ardor
to
proceed
seeming
to
vanish
on
the
*NL*
instant
.
Without
attending
to
this
sudden
change
in
the
other
's
humor
,
*NL*
the
scout
after
musing
a
moment
continued
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
no
woman
in
this
wilderness
could
leave
such
a
print
as
that

*NL*

the
dark-hair

her
sister
.
We
know
that
the
first
has
been
here
,
*NL*
but
where
are
the
signs
of
the
other
?
Let
us
push
deeper
on
the
trail
,
*NL*
and
if
nothing
offers
,
we
must
go
back
to
the
plain
and
strike
another
*NL*
scent
.
Move
on
,
Uncas
,
and
keep
your
eyes
on
the
dried
leaves

I
will
*NL*
watch
the
bushes
,
while
your
father
shall
run
with
a
low
nose
to
the
*NL*
ground

Move
on

the
sun
is
getting
behind
the
hills

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
there
nothing
that
I
can
do
?
''
demanded
the
anxious
Heyward
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
?
''
repeated
the
scout
,
who
,
with
his
red
friends
,
was
already
*NL*
advancing
in
the
order
he
had
prescribed
;
``
yes
,
you
can
keep
in
our
rear
*NL*
and
be
careful
not
to
cross
the
trail
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Before
they
had
proceeded
many
rods
,
the
Indians
stopped
,
and
appeared
*NL*
to
gaze
at
some
signs
on
the
earth
with
more
than
their
usual
keenness
.
*NL*
Both
father
and
son
spoke
quick
and
loud
,
now
looking
at
the
object
*NL*
of
their
mutual
admiration
,
and
now
regarding
each
other
with
the
most
*NL*
unequivocal
pleasure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
have
found
the
little
foot
!
''
exclaimed
the
scout
,
moving
forward
,
*NL*
without
attending
further
to
his
own
portion
of
the
duty
.
``
What
have
*NL*
we
here
?
An
ambushment
has
been
planted
in
the
spot
!
No
,
by
the
truest
*NL*
rifle
on
the
frontiers
,
here
have
been
them
one-sided
horses
again
!
Now
*NL*
the
whole
secret
is
out
,
and
all
is
plain
as
the
north
star
at
midnight
.
*NL*
Yes
,
here
they
have
mounted
.
There
the
beasts
have
been
bound
to
a
*NL*
sapling
,
in
waiting
;
and
yonder
runs
the
broad
path
away
to
the
north
,
*NL*
in
full
sweep
for
the
Canadas
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
still
there
are
no
signs
of
Alice
,
of
the
younger
Miss
Munro
,
''
said
*NL*
Duncan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Unless
the
shining
bauble
Uncas
has
just
lifted
from
the
ground
should
*NL*
prove
one

Pass
it
this
way
,
lad
,
that
we
may
look
at
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Heyward
instantly
knew
it
for
a
trinket
that
Alice
was
fond
of
wearing
,
*NL*
and
which
he
recollected
,
with
the
tenacious
memory
of
a
lover
,
to
have
*NL*
seen
,
on
the
fatal
morning
of
the
massacre
,
dangling
from
the
fair
neck
*NL*
of
his
mistress
.
He
seized
the
highly
prized
jewel
;
and
as
he
proclaimed
*NL*
the
fact
,
it
vanished
from
the
eyes
of
the
wondering
scout
,
who
in
vain
*NL*
looked
for
it
on
the
ground
,
long
after
it
was
warmly
pressed
against
*NL*
the
beating
heart
of
Duncan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pshaw
!
''
said
the
disappointed
Hawkeye
,
ceasing
to
rake
the
leaves
with
*NL*
the
breech
of
his
rifle
;
''
't
is
a
certain
sign
of
age
,
when
the
sight
*NL*
begins
to
weaken
.
Such
a
glittering
gewgaw
,
and
not
to
be
seen
!
Well
,
*NL*
well
,
I
can
squint
along
a
clouded
barrel
yet
,
and
that
is
enough
to
*NL*
settle
all
disputes
between
me
and
the
Mingoes
.
I
should
like
to
find
*NL*
the
thing
,
too
,
if
it
were
only
to
carry
it
to
the
right
owner
,
and
that
*NL*
would
be
bringing
the
two
ends
of
what
I
call
a
long
trail
together
,
*NL*
for
by
this
time
the
broad
St.
Lawrence
,
or
perhaps
,
the
Great
Lakes
*NL*
themselves
,
are
between
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
much
the
more
reason
why
we
should
not
delay
our
march
,
''
returned
*NL*
Heyward
;
``
let
us
proceed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Young
blood
and
hot
blood
,
they
say
,
are
much
the
same
thing
.
We
are
*NL*
not
about
to
start
on
a
squirrel
hunt
,
or
to
drive
a
deer
into
the
*NL*
Horican
,
but
to
outlie
for
days
and
nights
,
and
to
stretch
across
*NL*
a
wilderness
where
the
feet
of
men
seldom
go
,
and
where
no
bookish
*NL*
knowledge
would
carry
you
through
harmless
.
An
Indian
never
starts
on
*NL*
such
an
expedition
without
smoking
over
his
council-fire
;
and
,
though
*NL*
a
man
of
white
blood
,
I
honor
their
customs
in
this
particular
,
seeing
*NL*
that
they
are
deliberate
and
wise
.
We
will
,
therefore
,
go
back
,
and
*NL*
light
our
fire
to-night
in
the
ruins
of
the
old
fort
,
and
in
the
morning
*NL*
we
shall
be
fresh
,
and
ready
to
undertake
our
work
like
men
,
and
not
*NL*
like
babbling
women
or
eager
boys

''
*NL*
*NL*
Heyward
saw
,
by
the
manner
of
the
scout
,
that
altercation
would
be
*NL*
useless
.
Munro
had
again
sunk
into
that
sort
of
apathy
which
had
beset
*NL*
him
since
his
late
overwhelming
misfortunes
,
and
from
which
he
was
*NL*
apparently
to
be
roused
only
by
some
new
and
powerful
excitement
.
Making
*NL*
a
merit
of
necessity
,
the
young
man
took
the
veteran
by
the
arm
,
and
*NL*
followed
in
the
footsteps
of
the
Indians
and
the
scout
,
who
had
already
*NL*
begun
to
retrace
the
path
which
conducted
them
to
the
plain

*NL*
*NL*
The
shades
of
evening
had
come
to
increase
the
dreariness
of
the
place
,
*NL*
when
the
party
entered
the
ruins
of
William
Henry
.
The
scout
and
his
*NL*
companions
immediately
made
their
preparations
to
pass
the
night
there
;
*NL*
but
with
an
earnestness
and
sobriety
of
demeanor
that
betrayed
how
*NL*
much
the
unusual
horrors
they
had
just
witnessed
worked
on
even
their
*NL*
practised
feelings
.
A
few
fragments
of
rafters
were
reared
against
a
*NL*
blackened
wall
;
and
when
Uncas
had
covered
them
slightly
with
brush
,
*NL*
the
temporary
accommodations
were
deemed
sufficient
.
The
young
Indian
*NL*
pointed
toward
his
rude
hut
when
his
labor
was
ended
;
and
Heyward
,
who
*NL*
understood
the
meaning
of
the
silent
gestures
,
gently
urged
Munro
to
*NL*
enter
.
Leaving
the
bereaved
old
man
alone
with
his
sorrows
,
Duncan
*NL*
immediately
returned
into
the
open
air
,
too
much
excited
himself
to
seek
*NL*
the
repose
he
had
recommended
to
his
veteran
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
Hawkeye
and
the
Indians
lighted
their
fire
and
took
their
*NL*
evening
's
repast
,
a
frugal
meal
of
dried
bear
's
meat
,
the
young
man
paid
*NL*
a
visit
to
that
curtain
of
the
dilapidated
fort
which
looked
out
on
the
*NL*
sheet
of
the
Horican
.
The
wind
had
fallen
,
and
the
waves
were
already
*NL*
rolling
on
the
sandy
beach
beneath
him
,
in
a
more
regular
and
tempered
*NL*
succession
.
The
clouds
,
as
if
tired
of
their
furious
chase
,
were
*NL*
breaking
asunder
;
the
heavier
volumes
,
gathering
in
black
masses
about
*NL*
the
horizon
,
while
the
lighter
scud
still
hurried
above
the
water
,
or
*NL*
eddied
among
the
tops
of
the
mountains
,
like
broken
flights
of
birds
,
*NL*
hovering
around
their
roosts
.
Here
and
there
,
a
red
and
fiery
star
*NL*
struggled
through
the
drifting
vapor
,
furnishing
a
lurid
gleam
of
*NL*
brightness
to
the
dull
aspect
of
the
heavens
.
Within
the
bosom
of
the
*NL*
encircling
hills
,
an
impenetrable
darkness
had
already
settled
;
and
*NL*
the
plain
lay
like
a
vast
and
deserted
charnel-house
,
without
omen
or
*NL*
whisper
to
disturb
the
slumbers
of
its
numerous
and
hapless
tenants
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
this
scene
,
so
chillingly
in
accordance
with
the
past
,
Duncan
stood
*NL*
for
many
minutes
a
rapt
observer
.
His
eyes
wandered
from
the
bosom
of
*NL*
the
mound
,
where
the
foresters
were
seated
around
their
glimmering
fire
,
*NL*
to
the
fainter
light
which
still
lingered
in
the
skies
,
and
then
rested
*NL*
long
and
anxiously
on
the
embodied
gloom
,
which
lay
like
a
dreary
*NL*
void
on
that
side
of
him
where
the
dead
reposed
.
He
soon
fancied
that
*NL*
inexplicable
sounds
arose
from
the
place
,
though
so
indistinct
and
*NL*
stolen
,
as
to
render
not
only
their
nature
but
even
their
existence
*NL*
uncertain
.
Ashamed
of
his
apprehensions
,
the
young
man
turned
toward
the
*NL*
water
,
and
strove
to
divert
his
attention
to
the
mimic
stars
that
dimly
*NL*
glimmered
on
its
moving
surface
.
Still
,
his
too-conscious
ears
performed
*NL*
their
ungrateful
duty
,
as
if
to
warn
him
of
some
lurking
danger
.
At
*NL*
length
,
a
swift
trampling
seemed
,
quite
audibly
,
to
rush
athwart
the
*NL*
darkness
.
Unable
any
longer
to
quiet
his
uneasiness
,
Duncan
spoke
in
a
*NL*
low
voice
to
the
scout
,
requesting
him
to
ascend
the
mound
to
the
place
*NL*
where
he
stood
.
Hawkeye
threw
his
rifle
across
an
arm
and
complied
,
but
*NL*
with
an
air
so
unmoved
and
calm
,
as
to
prove
how
much
he
counted
on
the
*NL*
security
of
their
position
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
!
''
said
Duncan
,
when
the
other
placed
himself
deliberately
at
his
*NL*
elbow
;
``
there
are
suppressed
noises
on
the
plain
which
may
show
Montcalm
*NL*
has
not
yet
entirely
deserted
his
conquest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
ears
are
better
than
eyes
,
''
said
the
undisturbed
scout
,
who
,
*NL*
having
just
deposited
a
portion
of
a
bear
between
his
grinders
,
spoke
*NL*
thick
and
slow
,
like
one
whose
mouth
was
doubly
occupied
.
``
I
myself
saw
*NL*
him
caged
in
Ty
,
with
all
his
host
;
for
your
Frenchers
,
when
they
*NL*
have
done
a
clever
thing
,
like
to
get
back
,
and
have
a
dance
,
or
a
*NL*
merry-making
,
with
the
women
over
their
success
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
not
.
An
Indian
seldom
sleeps
in
war
,
and
plunder
may
keep
a
*NL*
Huron
here
after
his
tribe
has
departed
.
It
would
be
well
to
extinguish
*NL*
the
fire
,
and
have
a
watch
--
listen
!
you
hear
the
noise
I
mean
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
Indian
more
rarely
lurks
about
the
graves
.
Though
ready
to
slay
,
and
*NL*
not
over
regardful
of
the
means
,
he
is
commonly
content
with
the
scalp
,
*NL*
unless
when
blood
is
hot
,
and
temper
up
;
but
after
spirit
is
once
fairly
*NL*
gone
,
he
forgets
his
enmity
,
and
is
willing
to
let
the
dead
find
their
*NL*
natural
rest
.
Speaking
of
spirits
,
major
,
are
you
of
opinion
that
the
*NL*
heaven
of
a
red-skin
and
of
us
whites
will
be
of
one
and
the
same
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
doubt
--
no
doubt
.
I
thought
I
heard
it
again
!
or
was
it
the
rustling
*NL*
of
the
leaves
in
the
top
of
the
beech
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
my
own
part

''
continued
Hawkeye
,
turning
his
face
for
a
moment
*NL*
in
the
direction
indicated
by
Heyward
,
but
with
a
vacant
and
careless
*NL*
manner
,
``
I
believe
that
paradise
is
ordained
for
happiness
;
and
that
*NL*
men
will
be
indulged
in
it
according
to
their
dispositions
and
gifts
.
*NL*
I
,
therefore
,
judge
that
a
red-skin
is
not
far
from
the
truth
when
*NL*
he
believes
he
is
to
find
them
glorious
hunting
grounds
of
which
his
*NL*
traditions
tell
;
nor
,
for
that
matter
,
do
I
think
it
would
be
any
*NL*
disparagement
to
a
man
without
a
cross
to
pass
his
time

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
hear
it
again
?
''
interrupted
Duncan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
ay
;
when
food
is
scarce
,
and
when
food
is
plenty

a
wolf
grows

''
said
the
unmoved
scout
.
``
There
would
be
picking
,
too
,
among
the
*NL*
skins
of
the
devils
,
if
there
was
light
and
time
for
the
sport
.
But
,
*NL*
concerning
the
life
that
is
to
come
,
major
;
I
have
heard
preachers
say
,
*NL*
in
the
settlements
,
that
heaven
was
a
place
of
rest
.
Now
,
men
's
minds
*NL*
differ
as
to
their
ideas
of
enjoyment
.
For
myself
,
and
I
say
it
with
*NL*
reverence
to
the
ordering
of
Providence
,
it
would
be
no
great
indulgence
*NL*
to
be
kept
shut
up
in
those
mansions
of
which
they
preach
,
having
a
*NL*
natural
longing
for
motion
and
the
chase
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Duncan
,
who
was
now
made
to
understand
the
nature
of
the
noise
he
had
*NL*
heard
,
answered
,
with
more
attention
to
the
subject
which
the
humor
of
*NL*
the
scout
had
chosen
for
discussion
,
by
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
difficult
to
account
for
the
feelings
that
may
attend
the
last
*NL*
great
change
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
be
a
change
,
indeed
,
for
a
man
who
has
passed
his
days
in
*NL*
the
open
air
,
''
returned
the
single-minded
scout
;
``
and
who
has
so
often
*NL*
broken
his
fast
on
the
head
waters
of
the
Hudson
,
to
sleep
within
sound
*NL*
of
the
roaring
Mohawk
.
But
it
is
a
comfort
to
know
we
serve
a
merciful
*NL*
Master
,
though
we
do
it
each
after
his
fashion
,
and
with
great
tracts
of
*NL*
wilderness
atween
us
--
what
goes
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
not
the
rushing
of
the
wolves
you
have
mentioned
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hawkeye
slowly
shook
his
head
,
and
beckoned
for
Duncan
to
follow
him
*NL*
to
a
spot
to
which
the
glare
from
the
fire
did
not
extend
.
When
he
*NL*
had
taken
this
precaution
,
the
scout
placed
himself
in
an
attitude
of
*NL*
intense
attention
and
listened
long
and
keenly
for
a
repetition
of
the
*NL*
low
sound
that
had
so
unexpectedly
startled
him
.
His
vigilance
,
however
,
*NL*
seemed
exercised
in
vain
;
for
after
a
fruitless
pause
,
he
whispered
to
*NL*
Duncan
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
must
give
a
call
to
Uncas
.
The
boy
has
Indian
senses
,
and
he
may
*NL*
hear
what
is
hid
from
us
;
for
,
being
a
white-skin
,
I
will
not
deny
my
*NL*
nature
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
Mohican
,
who
was
conversing
in
a
low
voice
with
his
father
,
*NL*
started
as
he
heard
the
moaning
of
an
owl
,
and
,
springing
on
his
feet
,
*NL*
he
looked
toward
the
black
mounds
,
as
if
seeking
the
place
whence
the
*NL*
sounds
proceeded
.
The
scout
repeated
the
call
,
and
in
a
few
moments
,
*NL*
Duncan
saw
the
figure
of
Uncas
stealing
cautiously
along
the
rampart
,
to
*NL*
the
spot
where
they
stood
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hawkeye
explained
his
wishes
in
a
very
few
words
,
which
were
spoken
in
*NL*
the
Delaware
tongue
.
So
soon
as
Uncas
was
in
possession
of
the
reason
*NL*
why
he
was
summoned
,
he
threw
himself
flat
on
the
turf
;
where
,
to
the
*NL*
eyes
of
Duncan
,
he
appeared
to
lie
quiet
and
motionless
.
Surprised
at
*NL*
the
immovable
attitude
of
the
young
warrior
,
and
curious
to
observe
*NL*
the
manner
in
which
he
employed
his
faculties
to
obtain
the
desired
*NL*
information
,
Heyward
advanced
a
few
steps
,
and
bent
over
the
dark
object
*NL*
on
which
he
had
kept
his
eye
riveted
.
Then
it
was
he
discovered
that
the
*NL*
form
of
Uncas
vanished
,
and
that
he
beheld
only
the
dark
outline
of
an
*NL*
inequality
in
the
embankment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
has
become
of
the
Mohican
?
''
he
demanded
of
the
scout
,
stepping
*NL*
back
in
amazement
;
``
it
was
here
that
I
saw
him
fall
,
and
could
have
*NL*
sworn
that
here
he
yet
remained
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hist
!
speak
lower
;
for
we
know
not
what
ears
are
open
,
and
the
Mingoes
*NL*
are
a
quick-witted
breed
.
As
for
Uncas
,
he
is
out
on
the
plain
,
and
the
*NL*
Maquas
,
if
any
such
are
about
us
,
will
find
their
equal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
think
that
Montcalm
has
not
called
off
all
his
Indians
?
Let
us
give
*NL*
the
alarm
to
our
companions
,
that
we
may
stand
to
our
arms
.
Here
are
*NL*
five
of
us
,
who
are
not
unused
to
meet
an
enemy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
a
word
to
either
,
as
you
value
your
life
.
Look
at
the
Sagamore
,
how
*NL*
like
a
grand
Indian
chief
he
sits
by
the
fire
.
If
there
are
any
skulkers
*NL*
out
in
the
darkness
,
they
will
never
discover
,
by
his
countenance
,
that
*NL*
we
suspect
danger
at
hand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
they
may
discover
him
,
and
it
will
prove
his
death
.
His
person
can
*NL*
be
too
plainly
seen
by
the
light
of
that
fire
,
and
he
will
become
the
*NL*
first
and
most
certain
victim
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
undeniable
that
now
you
speak
the
truth
,
''
returned
the
scout
,
*NL*
betraying
more
anxiety
than
was
usual
;
``
yet
what
can
be
done
?
A
single
*NL*
suspicious
look
might
bring
on
an
attack
before
we
are
ready
to
receive
*NL*
it
.
He
knows
,
by
the
call
I
gave
to
Uncas
,
that
we
have
struck
a
scent
;
*NL*
I
will
tell
him
that
we
are
on
the
trail
of
the
Mingoes
;
his
Indian
*NL*
nature
will
teach
him
how
to
act
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
scout
applied
his
fingers
to
his
mouth
,
and
raised
a
low
hissing
*NL*
sound
,
that
caused
Duncan
at
first
to
start
aside
,
believing
that
he
*NL*
heard
a
serpent
.
The
head
of
Chingachgook
was
resting
on
a
hand
,
as
he
*NL*
sat
musing
by
himself
but
the
moment
he
had
heard
the
warning
of
the
*NL*
animal
whose
name
he
bore
,
he
arose
to
an
upright
position
,
and
his
dark
*NL*
eyes
glanced
swiftly
and
keenly
on
every
side
of
him
.
With
his
sudden
*NL*
and
,
perhaps
,
involuntary
movement
,
every
appearance
of
surprise
or
*NL*
alarm
ended
.
His
rifle
lay
untouched
,
and
apparently
unnoticed
,
within
*NL*
reach
of
his
hand
.
The
tomahawk
that
he
had
loosened
in
his
belt
for
the
*NL*
sake
of
ease
,
was
even
suffered
to
fall
from
its
usual
situation
to
the
*NL*
ground
,
and
his
form
seemed
to
sink
,
like
that
of
a
man
whose
nerves
*NL*
and
sinews
were
suffered
to
relax
for
the
purpose
of
rest
.
Cunningly
*NL*
resuming
his
former
position
,
though
with
a
change
of
hands
,
as
if
the
*NL*
movement
had
been
made
merely
to
relieve
the
limb
,
the
native
awaited
*NL*
the
result
with
a
calmness
and
fortitude
that
none
but
an
Indian
warrior
*NL*
would
have
known
how
to
exercise
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Heyward
saw
that
while
to
a
less
instructed
eye
the
Mohican
chief
*NL*
appeared
to
slumber
,
his
nostrils
were
expanded
,
his
head
was
turned
a
*NL*
little
to
one
side
,
as
if
to
assist
the
organs
of
hearing
,
and
that
his
*NL*
quick
and
rapid
glances
ran
incessantly
over
every
object
within
the
*NL*
power
of
his
vision
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
See
the
noble
fellow
!
''
whispered
Hawkeye
,
pressing
the
arm
of
Heyward
;
*NL*
``
he
knows
that
a
look
or
a
motion
might
disconsart
our
schemes
,
and
put
*NL*
us
at
the
mercy
of
them
imps
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
interrupted
by
the
flash
and
report
of
a
rifle
.
The
air
was
*NL*
filled
with
sparks
of
fire
,
around
that
spot
where
the
eyes
of
Heyward
*NL*
were
still
fastened
,
with
admiration
and
wonder
.
A
second
look
told
him
*NL*
that
Chingachgook
had
disappeared
in
the
confusion
.
In
the
meantime
,
the
*NL*
scout
had
thrown
forward
his
rifle
,
like
one
prepared
for
service
,
and
*NL*
awaited
impatiently
the
moment
when
an
enemy
might
rise
to
view
.
*NL*
But
with
the
solitary
and
fruitless
attempt
made
on
the
life
of
*NL*
Chingachgook
,
the
attack
appeared
to
have
terminated
.
Once
or
twice
the
*NL*
listeners
thought
they
could
distinguish
the
distant
rustling
of
bushes
,
*NL*
as
bodies
of
some
unknown
description
rushed
through
them
;
nor
was
it
*NL*
long
before
Hawkeye
pointed
out
the
``
scampering
of
the
wolves
,
''
as
they
*NL*
fled
precipitately
before
the
passage
of
some
intruder
on
their
proper
*NL*
domains
.
After
an
impatient
and
breathless
pause
,
a
plunge
was
heard
*NL*
in
the
water
,
and
it
was
immediately
followed
by
the
report
of
another
*NL*
rifle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
goes
Uncas
!
''
said
the
scout
;
``
the
boy
bears
a
smart
piece
!
I
know
*NL*
its
crack
,
as
well
as
a
father
knows
the
language
of
his
child
,
for
I
*NL*
carried
the
gun
myself
until
a
better
offered
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
can
this
mean
?
''
demanded
Duncan
,
``
we
are
watched
,
and
,
as
it
would
*NL*
seem
,
marked
for
destruction
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yonder
scattered
brand
can
witness
that
no
good
was
intended
,
and
this
*NL*
Indian
will
testify
that
no
harm
has
been
done
,
''
returned
the
scout
,
*NL*
dropping
his
rifle
across
his
arm
again
,
and
following
Chingachgook
,
who
*NL*
just
then
reappeared
within
the
circle
of
light
,
into
the
bosom
of
the
*NL*
work
.
``
How
is
it
,
Sagamore
?
Are
the
Mingoes
upon
us
in
earnest
,
or
is
it
*NL*
only
one
of
those
reptiles
who
hang
upon
the
skirts
of
a
war-party
,
*NL*
to
scalp
the
dead
,
go
in
,
and
make
their
boast
among
the
squaws
of
the
*NL*
valiant
deeds
done
on
the
pale
faces
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Chingachgook
very
quietly
resumed
his
seat
;
nor
did
he
make
any
reply
,
*NL*
until
after
he
had
examined
the
firebrand
which
had
been
struck
by
*NL*
the
bullet
that
had
nearly
proved
fatal
to
himself
.
After
which
he
was
*NL*
content
to
reply
,
holding
a
single
finger
up
to
view
,
with
the
English
*NL*
monosyllable
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
as
much
,
''
returned
Hawkeye
,
seating
himself
;
``
and
as
he
had
*NL*
got
the
cover
of
the
lake
afore
Uncas
pulled
upon
him
,
it
is
more
than
*NL*
probable
the
knave
will
sing
his
lies
about
some
great
ambushment
,
*NL*
in
which
he
was
outlying
on
the
trail
of
two
Mohicans
and
a
white
*NL*
hunter
--
for
the
officers
can
be
considered
as
little
better
than
idlers
*NL*
in
such
a
scrimmage
.
Well
,
let
him
--
let
him
.
There
are
always
some
*NL*
honest
men
in
every
nation
,
though
heaven
knows
,
too
,
that
they
are
*NL*
scarce
among
the
Maquas
,
to
look
down
an
upstart
when
he
brags
ag

in
the
*NL*
face
of
reason
.
The
varlet
sent
his
lead
within
whistle
of
your
ears

*NL*
Sagamore

''
*NL*
*NL*
Chingachgook
turned
a
calm
and
incurious
eye
toward
the
place
where
the
*NL*
ball
had
struck
,
and
then
resumed
his
former
attitude
,
with
a
composure
*NL*
that
could
not
be
disturbed
by
so
trifling
an
incident
.
Just
then
Uncas
*NL*
glided
into
the
circle
,
and
seated
himself
at
the
fire
,
with
the
same
*NL*
appearance
of
indifference
as
was
maintained
by
his
father

*NL*
*NL*
Of
these
several
moments
Heyward
was
a
deeply
interested
and
wondering
*NL*
observer
.
It
appeared
to
him
as
though
the
foresters
had
some
secret
*NL*
means
of
intelligence
,
which
had
escaped
the
vigilance
of
his
own
*NL*
faculties
.
In
place
of
that
eager
and
garrulous
narration
with
which
*NL*
a
white
youth
would
have
endeavored
to
communicate
,
and
perhaps
*NL*
exaggerate
,
that
which
had
passed
out
in
the
darkness
of
the
plain
,
*NL*
the
young
warrior
was
seemingly
content
to
let
his
deeds
speak
for
*NL*
themselves
.
It
was
,
in
fact
,
neither
the
moment
nor
the
occasion
for
an
*NL*
Indian
to
boast
of
his
exploits
;
and
it
is
probably
that
,
had
Heyward
*NL*
neglected
to
inquire
,
not
another
syllable
would
,
just
then
,
have
been
*NL*
uttered
on
the
subject
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
has
become
of
our
enemy
,
Uncas
?
''
demanded
Duncan
;
``
we
heard
your
*NL*
rifle
,
and
hoped
you
had
not
fired
in
vain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
chief
removed
a
fold
of
his
hunting
skirt
,
and
quietly
*NL*
exposed
the
fatal
tuft
of
hair
,
which
he
bore
as
the
symbol
of
victory
.
*NL*
Chingachgook
laid
his
hand
on
the
scalp
,
and
considered
it
for
a
moment
*NL*
with
deep
attention
.
Then
dropping
it
,
with
disgust
depicted
in
his
*NL*
strong
features
,
he
ejaculated
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oneida
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oneida
!
''
repeated
the
scout
,
who
was
fast
losing
his
interest
in
the
*NL*
scene
,
in
an
apathy
nearly
assimilated
to
that
of
his
red
associates
,
*NL*
but
who
now
advanced
in
uncommon
earnestness
to
regard
the
bloody
badge
.
*NL*
``
By
the
Lord
,
if
the
Oneidas
are
outlying
upon
the
trail
,
we
shall
by
*NL*
flanked
by
devils
on
every
side
of
us
!
Now
,
to
white
eyes
there
is
no
*NL*
difference
between
this
bit
of
skin
and
that
of
any
other
Indian
,
and
*NL*
yet
the
Sagamore
declares
it
came
from
the
poll
of
a
Mingo
;
nay
,
he
even
*NL*
names
the
tribe
of
the
poor
devil
,
with
as
much
ease
as
if
the
scalp
was
*NL*
the
leaf
of
a
book
,
and
each
hair
a
letter
.
What
right
have
Christian
*NL*
whites
to
boast
of
their
learning
,
when
a
savage
can
read
a
language
*NL*
that
would
prove
too
much
for
the
wisest
of
them
all
!
What
say
you
,
lad
,
*NL*
of
what
people
was
the
knave
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Uncas
raised
his
eyes
to
the
face
of
the
scout
,
and
answered
,
in
his
*NL*
soft
voice
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oneida
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oneida
,
again
!
when
one
Indian
makes
a
declaration
it
is
commonly
true
;
*NL*
but
when
he
is
supported
by
his
people
,
set
it
down
as
gospel
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
poor
fellow
has
mistaken
us
for
French
,
''
said
Heyward
;
``
or
he
would
*NL*
not
have
attempted
the
life
of
a
friend
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
mistake
a
Mohican
in
his
paint
for
a
Huron
!
You
would
be
as
likely
*NL*
to
mistake
the
white-coated
grenadiers
of
Montcalm
for
the
scarlet
*NL*
jackets
of
the
Royal
Americans
,
''
returned
the
scout
.
``
No
,
no
,
the
*NL*
sarpent
knew
his
errand
;
nor
was
there
any
great
mistake
in
the
matter
,
*NL*
for
there
is
but
little
love
atween
a
Delaware
and
a
Mingo
,
let
their
*NL*
tribes
go
out
to
fight
for
whom
they
may
,
in
a
white
quarrel
.
For
*NL*
that
matter
,
though
the
Oneidas
do
serve
his
sacred
majesty
,
who
is
*NL*
my
sovereign
lord
and
master
,
I
should
not
have
deliberated
long
about
*NL*
letting
off
`
killdeer
'
at
the
imp
myself
,
had
luck
thrown
him
in
my
*NL*
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
would
have
been
an
abuse
of
our
treaties
,
and
unworthy
of
your
*NL*
character
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
a
man
consort
much
with
a
people
,
''
continued
Hawkeye
,
``
if
they
*NL*
were
honest
and
he
no
knave
,
love
will
grow
up
atwixt
them
.
It
is
true
*NL*
that
white
cunning
has
managed
to
throw
the
tribes
into
great
confusion
,
*NL*
as
respects
friends
and
enemies
;
so
that
the
Hurons
and
the
Oneidas
,
who
*NL*
speak
the
same
tongue
,
or
what
may
be
called
the
same
,
take
each
other
's
*NL*
scalps
,
and
the
Delawares
are
divided
among
themselves
;
a
few
hanging
*NL*
about
their
great
council-fire
on
their
own
river
,
and
fighting
on
the
*NL*
same
side
with
the
Mingoes
while
the
greater
part
are
in
the
Canadas
,
*NL*
out
of
natural
enmity
to
the
Maquas
--
thus
throwing
everything
into
*NL*
disorder
,
and
destroying
all
the
harmony
of
warfare
.
Yet
a
red
natur
'
is
*NL*
not
likely
to
alter
with
every
shift
of
policy
;
so
that
the
love
atwixt
*NL*
a
Mohican
and
a
Mingo
is
much
like
the
regard
between
a
white
man
and
a
*NL*
sarpent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
regret
to
hear
it
;
for
I
had
believed
those
natives
who
dwelt
within
*NL*
our
boundaries
had
found
us
too
just
and
liberal
,
not
to
identify
*NL*
themselves
fully
with
our
quarrels
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
I
believe
it
is
natur
'
to
give
a
preference
to
one
's
own
quarrels
*NL*
before
those
of
strangers
.
Now
,
for
myself
,
I
do
love
justice
;
and
,
*NL*
therefore
,
I
will
not
say
I
hate
a
Mingo
,
for
that
may
be
unsuitable
to
*NL*
my
color
and
my
religion
,
though
I
will
just
repeat
,
it
may
have
been
*NL*
owing
to
the
night
that
`
killdeer
'
had
no
hand
in
the
death
of
this
*NL*
skulking
Oneida
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
as
if
satisfied
with
the
force
of
his
own
reasons
,
whatever
might
*NL*
be
their
effect
on
the
opinions
of
the
other
disputant
,
the
honest
but
*NL*
implacable
woodsman
turned
from
the
fire
,
content
to
let
the
controversy
*NL*
slumber
.
Heyward
withdrew
to
the
rampart
,
too
uneasy
and
too
little
*NL*
accustomed
to
the
warfare
of
the
woods
to
remain
at
ease
under
the
*NL*
possibility
of
such
insidious
attacks
.
Not
so
,
however
,
with
the
scout
*NL*
and
the
Mohicans
.
Those
acute
and
long-practised
senses
,
whose
powers
so
*NL*
often
exceed
the
limits
of
all
ordinary
credulity
,
after
having
detected
*NL*
the
danger
,
had
enabled
them
to
ascertain
its
magnitude
and
duration
.
*NL*
Not
one
of
the
three
appeared
in
the
least
to
doubt
their
perfect
*NL*
security
,
as
was
indicated
by
the
preparations
that
were
soon
made
to
*NL*
sit
in
council
over
their
future
proceedings
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
confusion
of
nations
,
and
even
of
tribes
,
to
which
Hawkeye
alluded
,
*NL*
existed
at
that
period
in
the
fullest
force
.
The
great
tie
of
language
,
*NL*
and
,
of
course
,
of
a
common
origin
,
was
severed
in
many
places
;
and
it
*NL*
was
one
of
its
consequences
,
that
the
Delaware
and
the
Mingo
-LRB-
as
the
*NL*
people
of
the
Six
Nations
were
called
-RRB-
were
found
fighting
in
the
same
*NL*
ranks
,
while
the
latter
sought
the
scalp
of
the
Huron
,
though
believed
*NL*
to
be
the
root
of
his
own
stock
.
The
Delawares
were
even
divided
among
*NL*
themselves
.
Though
love
for
the
soil
which
had
belonged
to
his
ancestors
*NL*
kept
the
Sagamore
of
the
Mohicans
with
a
small
band
of
followers
who
*NL*
were
serving
at
Edward
,
under
the
banners
of
the
English
king
,
by
far
*NL*
the
largest
portion
of
his
nation
were
known
to
be
in
the
field
as
*NL*
allies
of
Montcalm
.
The
reader
probably
knows
,
if
enough
has
not
already
*NL*
been
gleaned
form
this
narrative
,
that
the
Delaware
,
or
Lenape
,
claimed
*NL*
to
be
the
progenitors
of
that
numerous
people
,
who
once
were
masters
*NL*
of
most
of
the
eastern
and
northern
states
of
America
,
of
whom
the
*NL*
community
of
the
Mohicans
was
an
ancient
and
highly
honored
member
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
,
of
course
,
with
a
perfect
understanding
of
the
minute
and
*NL*
intricate
interests
which
had
armed
friend
against
friend
,
and
brought
*NL*
natural
enemies
to
combat
by
each
other
's
side
,
that
the
scout
and
his
*NL*
companions
now
disposed
themselves
to
deliberate
on
the
measures
that
*NL*
were
to
govern
their
future
movements
,
amid
so
many
jarring
and
savage
*NL*
races
of
men
.
Duncan
knew
enough
of
Indian
customs
to
understand
*NL*
the
reason
that
the
fire
was
replenished
,
and
why
the
warriors
,
not
*NL*
excepting
Hawkeye
,
took
their
seats
within
the
curl
of
its
smoke
with
*NL*
so
much
gravity
and
decorum
.
Placing
himself
at
an
angle
of
the
works
,
*NL*
where
he
might
be
a
spectator
of
the
scene
without
,
he
awaited
the
*NL*
result
with
as
much
patience
as
he
could
summon
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
short
and
impressive
pause
,
Chingachgook
lighted
a
pipe
whose
*NL*
bowl
was
curiously
carved
in
one
of
the
soft
stones
of
the
country
,
*NL*
and
whose
stem
was
a
tube
of
wood
,
and
commenced
smoking
.
When
he
had
*NL*
inhaled
enough
of
the
fragrance
of
the
soothing
weed
,
he
passed
the
*NL*
instrument
into
the
hands
of
the
scout
.
In
this
manner
the
pipe
had
made
*NL*
its
rounds
three
several
times
,
amid
the
most
profound
silence
,
before
*NL*
either
of
the
party
opened
his
lips
.
Then
the
Sagamore
,
as
the
oldest
*NL*
and
highest
in
rank
,
in
a
few
calm
and
dignified
words
,
proposed
the
*NL*
subject
for
deliberation
.
He
was
answered
by
the
scout
;
and
Chingachgook
*NL*
rejoined
,
when
the
other
objected
to
his
opinions
.
But
the
youthful
*NL*
Uncas
continued
a
silent
and
respectful
listener
,
until
Hawkeye
,
in
*NL*
complaisance
,
demanded
his
opinion
.
Heyward
gathered
from
the
manners
of
*NL*
the
different
speakers
,
that
the
father
and
son
espoused
one
side
of
a
*NL*
disputed
question
,
while
the
white
man
maintained
the
other
.
The
contest
*NL*
gradually
grew
warmer
,
until
it
was
quite
evident
the
feelings
of
the
*NL*
speakers
began
to
be
somewhat
enlisted
in
the
debate
.
*NL*
*NL*
Notwithstanding
the
increasing
warmth
of
the
amicable
contest
,
the
*NL*
most
decorous
Christian
assembly
,
not
even
excepting
those
in
which
its
*NL*
reverend
ministers
are
collected
,
might
have
learned
a
wholesome
lesson
*NL*
of
moderation
from
the
forbearance
and
courtesy
of
the
disputants
.
The
*NL*
words
of
Uncas
were
received
with
the
same
deep
attention
as
those
which
*NL*
fell
from
the
maturer
wisdom
of
his
father
;
and
so
far
from
manifesting
*NL*
any
impatience
,
neither
spoke
in
reply
,
until
a
few
moments
of
silent
*NL*
meditation
were
,
seemingly
,
bestowed
in
deliberating
on
what
had
already
*NL*
been
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
language
of
the
Mohicans
was
accompanied
by
gestures
so
direct
and
*NL*
natural
that
Heyward
had
but
little
difficulty
in
following
the
thread
*NL*
of
their
argument
.
On
the
other
hand
,
the
scout
was
obscure
;
because
*NL*
from
the
lingering
pride
of
color
,
he
rather
affected
the
cold
and
*NL*
artificial
manner
which
characterizes
all
classes
of
Anglo-Americans
*NL*
when
unexcited
.
By
the
frequency
with
which
the
Indians
described
the
*NL*
marks
of
a
forest
trial
,
it
was
evident
they
urged
a
pursuit
by
land
,
*NL*
while
the
repeated
sweep
of
Hawkeye
's
arm
toward
the
Horican
denoted
*NL*
that
he
was
for
a
passage
across
its
waters
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
latter
was
to
every
appearance
fast
losing
ground
,
and
the
point
was
*NL*
about
to
be
decided
against
him
,
when
he
arose
to
his
feet
,
and
shaking
*NL*
off
his
apathy
,
he
suddenly
assumed
the
manner
of
an
Indian
,
and
adopted
*NL*
all
the
arts
of
native
eloquence
.
Elevating
an
arm
,
he
pointed
out
the
*NL*
track
of
the
sun
,
repeating
the
gesture
for
every
day
that
was
necessary
*NL*
to
accomplish
their
objects
.
Then
he
delineated
a
long
and
painful
path
,
*NL*
amid
rocks
and
water-courses
.
The
age
and
weakness
of
the
slumbering
and
*NL*
unconscious
Munro
were
indicated
by
signs
too
palpable
to
be
mistaken
.
*NL*
Duncan
perceived
that
even
his
own
powers
were
spoken
lightly
of
,
as
*NL*
the
scout
extended
his
palm
,
and
mentioned
him
by
the
appellation
of
*NL*
the
``
Open
Hand
''
--
a
name
his
liberality
had
purchased
of
all
the
friendly
*NL*
tribes
.
Then
came
a
representation
of
the
light
and
graceful
movements
*NL*
of
a
canoe
,
set
in
forcible
contrast
to
the
tottering
steps
of
one
*NL*
enfeebled
and
tired
.
He
concluded
by
pointing
to
the
scalp
of
the
*NL*
Oneida
,
and
apparently
urging
the
necessity
of
their
departing
speedily
,
*NL*
and
in
a
manner
that
should
leave
no
trail
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Mohicans
listened
gravely
,
and
with
countenances
that
reflected
the
*NL*
sentiments
of
the
speaker
.
Conviction
gradually
wrought
its
influence
,
*NL*
and
toward
the
close
of
Hawkeye
's
speech
,
his
sentences
were
accompanied
*NL*
by
the
customary
exclamation
of
commendation
.
In
short
,
Uncas
and
his
*NL*
father
became
converts
to
his
way
of
thinking
,
abandoning
their
own
*NL*
previously
expressed
opinions
with
a
liberality
and
candor
that
,
had
*NL*
they
been
the
representatives
of
some
great
and
civilized
people
,
would
*NL*
have
infallibly
worked
their
political
ruin
,
by
destroying
forever
their
*NL*
reputation
for
consistency
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
instant
the
matter
in
discussion
was
decided
,
the
debate
,
and
*NL*
everything
connected
with
it
,
except
the
result
appeared
to
be
*NL*
forgotten
.
Hawkeye
,
without
looking
round
to
read
his
triumph
in
*NL*
applauding
eyes
,
very
composedly
stretched
his
tall
frame
before
the
*NL*
dying
embers
,
and
closed
his
own
organs
in
sleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
Left
now
in
a
measure
to
themselves
,
the
Mohicans
,
whose
time
had
been
*NL*
so
much
devoted
to
the
interests
of
others
,
seized
the
moment
to
devote
*NL*
some
attention
to
themselves
.
Casting
off
at
once
the
grave
and
austere
*NL*
demeanor
of
an
Indian
chief
,
Chingachgook
commenced
speaking
to
his
*NL*
son
in
the
soft
and
playful
tones
of
affection
.
Uncas
gladly
met
the
*NL*
familiar
air
of
his
father
;
and
before
the
hard
breathing
of
the
scout
*NL*
announced
that
he
slept
,
a
complete
change
was
effected
in
the
manner
of
*NL*
his
two
associates
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
impossible
to
describe
the
music
of
their
language
,
while
thus
*NL*
engaged
in
laughter
and
endearments
,
in
such
a
way
as
to
render
it
*NL*
intelligible
to
those
whose
ears
have
never
listened
to
its
melody
.
*NL*
The
compass
of
their
voices
,
particularly
that
of
the
youth
,
was
*NL*
wonderful
--
extending
from
the
deepest
bass
to
tones
that
were
even
*NL*
feminine
in
softness
.
The
eyes
of
the
father
followed
the
plastic
and
*NL*
ingenious
movements
of
the
son
with
open
delight
,
and
he
never
failed
to
*NL*
smile
in
reply
to
the
other
's
contagious
but
low
laughter
.
While
under
*NL*
the
influence
of
these
gentle
and
natural
feelings
,
no
trace
of
ferocity
*NL*
was
to
be
seen
in
the
softened
features
of
the
Sagamore
.
His
figured
*NL*
panoply
of
death
looked
more
like
a
disguise
assumed
in
mockery
than
a
*NL*
fierce
annunciation
of
a
desire
to
carry
destruction
in
his
footsteps
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
an
hour
had
passed
in
the
indulgence
of
their
better
feelings
,
*NL*
Chingachgook
abruptly
announced
his
desire
to
sleep
,
by
wrapping
his
*NL*
head
in
his
blanket
and
stretching
his
form
on
the
naked
earth
.
The
*NL*
merriment
of
Uncas
instantly
ceased
;
and
carefully
raking
the
coals
in
*NL*
such
a
manner
that
they
should
impart
their
warmth
to
his
father
's
feet
,
*NL*
the
youth
sought
his
own
pillow
among
the
ruins
of
the
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
Imbibing
renewed
confidence
from
the
security
of
these
experienced
*NL*
foresters
,
Heyward
soon
imitated
their
example
;
and
long
before
the
*NL*
night
had
turned
,
they
who
lay
in
the
bosom
of
the
ruined
work
,
seemed
*NL*
to
slumber
as
heavily
as
the
unconscious
multitude
whose
bones
were
*NL*
already
beginning
to
bleach
on
the
surrounding
plain
.

Childe
Harold
*NL*
*NL*
The
heavens
were
still
studded
with
stars
,
when
Hawkeye
came
to
arouse
*NL*
the
sleepers
.
Casting
aside
their
cloaks
Munro
and
Heyward
were
on
their
*NL*
feet
while
the
woodsman
was
still
making
his
low
calls
,
at
the
entrance
*NL*
of
the
rude
shelter
where
they
had
passed
the
night
.
When
they
issued
*NL*
from
beneath
its
concealment
,
they
found
the
scout
awaiting
their
*NL*
appearance
nigh
by
,
and
the
only
salutation
between
them
was
the
*NL*
significant
gesture
for
silence
,
made
by
their
sagacious
leader
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Think
over
your
prayers
,
''
he
whispered
,
as
they
approached
him
;
``
for
He
*NL*
to
whom
you
make
them
,
knows
all
tongues
;
that
of
the
heart
,
as
well
*NL*
as
those
of
the
mouth
.
But
speak
not
a
syllable
;
it
is
rare
for
a
white
*NL*
voice
to
pitch
itself
properly
in
the
woods
,
as
we
have
seen
by
the
*NL*
example
of
that
miserable
devil
,
the
singer
.
Come
,
''
he
continued
,
*NL*
turning
toward
a
curtain
of
the
works
;
``
let
us
get
into
the
ditch
on
*NL*
this
side
,
and
be
regardful
to
step
on
the
stones
and
fragments
of
wood
*NL*
as
you
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
companions
complied
,
though
to
two
of
them
the
reasons
of
this
*NL*
extraordinary
precaution
were
yet
a
mystery
.
When
they
were
in
the
low
*NL*
cavity
that
surrounded
the
earthen
fort
on
three
sides
,
they
found
that
*NL*
passage
nearly
choked
by
the
ruins
.
With
care
and
patience
,
however
,
*NL*
they
succeeded
in
clambering
after
the
scout
,
until
they
reached
the
*NL*
sandy
shore
of
the
Horican
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
a
trail
that
nothing
but
a
nose
can
follow
,
''
said
the
satisfied
*NL*
scout
,
looking
back
along
their
difficult
way
;
``
grass
is
a
treacherous
*NL*
carpet
for
a
flying
party
to
tread
on
,
but
wood
and
stone
take
no
print
*NL*
from
a
moccasin
.
Had
you
worn
your
armed
boots
,
there
might
,
indeed
,
*NL*
have
been
something
to
fear
;
but
with
the
deer-skin
suitably
prepared
,
*NL*
a
man
may
trust
himself
,
generally
,
on
rocks
with
safety
.
Shove
in
the
*NL*
canoe
nigher
to
the
land
,
Uncas
;
this
sand
will
take
a
stamp
as
easily
*NL*
as
the
butter
of
the
Jarmans
on
the
Mohawk
.
Softly
,
lad
,
softly
;
it
must
*NL*
not
touch
the
beach
,
or
the
knaves
will
know
by
what
road
we
have
left
*NL*
the
place
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
observed
the
precaution
;
and
the
scout
,
laying
a
board
*NL*
from
the
ruins
to
the
canoe
,
made
a
sign
for
the
two
officers
to
enter
.
*NL*
When
this
was
done
,
everything
was
studiously
restored
to
its
former
*NL*
disorder
;
and
then
Hawkeye
succeeded
in
reaching
his
little
birchen
*NL*
vessel
,
without
leaving
behind
him
any
of
those
marks
which
he
appeared
*NL*
so
much
to
dread
.
Heyward
was
silent
until
the
Indians
had
cautiously
*NL*
paddled
the
canoe
some
distance
from
the
fort
,
and
within
the
broad
and
*NL*
dark
shadows
that
fell
from
the
eastern
mountain
on
the
glassy
surface
*NL*
of
the
lake
;
then
he
demanded
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
need
have
we
for
this
stolen
and
hurried
departure
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
the
blood
of
an
Oneida
could
stain
such
a
sheet
of
pure
water
as
*NL*
this
we
float
on
,
''
returned
the
scout
,
``
your
two
eyes
would
answer
your
*NL*
own
question
.
Have
you
forgotten
the
skulking
reptile
Uncas
slew
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
no
means
.
But
he
was
said
to
be
alone
,
and
dead
men
give
no
cause
*NL*
for
fear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
he
was
alone
in
his
deviltry
!
but
an
Indian
whose
tribe
counts
so
*NL*
many
warriors
,
need
seldom
fear
his
blood
will
run
without
the
death
*NL*
shriek
coming
speedily
from
some
of
his
enemies
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
our
presence
--
the
authority
of
Colonel
Munro
--
would
prove
*NL*
sufficient
protection
against
the
anger
of
our
allies
,
especially
in
a
*NL*
case
where
the
wretch
so
well
merited
his
fate
.
I
trust
in
Heaven
you
*NL*
have
not
deviated
a
single
foot
from
the
direct
line
of
our
course
with
*NL*
so
slight
a
reason
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
the
bullet
of
that
varlet
's
rifle
would
have
turned
aside
,
*NL*
though
his
sacred
majesty
the
king
had
stood
in
its
path
?
''
returned
*NL*
the
stubborn
scout
.
``
Why
did
not
the
grand
Frencher
,
he
who
is
*NL*
captain-general
of
the
Canadas
,
bury
the
tomahawks
of
the
Hurons
,
if
a
*NL*
word
from
a
white
can
work
so
strongly
on
the
natur
'
of
an
Indian
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
reply
of
Heyward
was
interrupted
by
a
groan
from
Munro
;
but
after
*NL*
he
had
paused
a
moment
,
in
deference
to
the
sorrow
of
his
aged
friend
he
*NL*
resumed
the
subject
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
marquis
of
Montcalm
can
only
settle
that
error
with
his
God
,
''
said
*NL*
the
young
man
solemnly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
ay
,
now
there
is
reason
in
your
words
,
for
they
are
bottomed
on
*NL*
religion
and
honesty
.
There
is
a
vast
difference
between
throwing
a
*NL*
regiment
of
white
coats
atwixt
the
tribes
and
the
prisoners
,
and
coaxing
*NL*
an
angry
savage
to
forget
he
carries
a
knife
and
rifle
,
with
words
that
*NL*
must
begin
with
calling
him
your
son
.
No
,
no
,
''
continued
the
scout
,
*NL*
looking
back
at
the
dim
shore
of
William
Henry
,
which
was
now
fast
*NL*
receding
,
and
laughing
in
his
own
silent
but
heartfelt
manner
;
``
I
have
*NL*
put
a
trail
of
water
atween
us
;
and
unless
the
imps
can
make
friends
*NL*
with
the
fishes
,
and
hear
who
has
paddled
across
their
basin
this
fine
*NL*
morning
,
we
shall
throw
the
length
of
the
Horican
behind
us
before
they
*NL*
have
made
up
their
minds
which
path
to
take
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
foes
in
front
,
and
foes
in
our
rear
,
our
journey
is
like
to
be
one
*NL*
of
danger
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Danger
!
''
repeated
Hawkeye
,
calmly
;
``
no
,
not
absolutely
of
danger
;
for
,
*NL*
with
vigilant
ears
and
quick
eyes
,
we
can
manage
to
keep
a
few
hours
*NL*
ahead
of
the
knaves
;
or
,
if
we
must
try
the
rifle
,
there
are
three
of
us
*NL*
who
understand
its
gifts
as
well
as
any
you
can
name
on
the
borders
.
No
,
*NL*
not
of
danger
;
but
that
we
shall
have
what
you
may
call
a
brisk
push
of
*NL*
it
,
is
probable
;
and
it
may
happen
,
a
brush
,
a
scrimmage
,
or
some
such
*NL*
divarsion
,
but
always
where
covers
are
good
,
and
ammunition
abundant
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
possible
that
Heyward
's
estimate
of
danger
differed
in
some
degree
*NL*
from
that
of
the
scout
,
for
,
instead
of
replying
,
he
now
sat
in
silence
,
*NL*
while
the
canoe
glided
over
several
miles
of
water
.
Just
as
the
day
*NL*
dawned
,
they
entered
the
narrows
of
the
lake
*
,
and
stole
swiftly
and
*NL*
cautiously
among
their
numberless
little
islands
.
It
was
by
this
road
*NL*
that
Montcalm
had
retired
with
his
army
,
and
the
adventurers
knew
not
*NL*
but
he
had
left
some
of
his
Indians
in
ambush
,
to
protect
the
rear
of
*NL*
his
forces
,
and
collect
the
stragglers
.
They
,
therefore
,
approached
the
*NL*
passage
with
the
customary
silence
of
their
guarded
habits
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
The
beauties
of
Lake
George
are
well
known
to
every
*NL*
American
tourist
.
In
the
height
of
the
mountains
which
*NL*
surround
it
,
and
in
artificial
accessories
,
it
is
inferior
*NL*
to
the
finest
of
the
Swiss
and
Italian
lakes
,
while
in
*NL*
outline
and
purity
of
water
it
is
fully
their
equal
;
and
in
*NL*
the
number
and
disposition
of
its
isles
and
islets
much
*NL*
superior
to
them
all
together
.
There
are
said
to
be
some
*NL*
hundreds
of
islands
in
a
sheet
of
water
less
than
thirty
*NL*
miles
long
.
The
narrows
,
which
connect
what
may
be
called
,
*NL*
in
truth
,
two
lakes
,
are
crowded
with
islands
to
such
a
*NL*
degree
as
to
leave
passages
between
them
frequently
of
only
*NL*
a
few
feet
in
width
.
The
lake
itself
varies
in
breadth
from
*NL*
one
to
three
miles
.
*NL*
*NL*
Chingachgook
laid
aside
his
paddle
;
while
Uncas
and
the
scout
urged
the
*NL*
light
vessel
through
crooked
and
intricate
channels
,
where
every
foot
*NL*
that
they
advanced
exposed
them
to
the
danger
of
some
sudden
rising
*NL*
on
their
progress
.
The
eyes
of
the
Sagamore
moved
warily
from
islet
to
*NL*
islet
,
and
copse
to
copse
,
as
the
canoe
proceeded
;
and
,
when
a
clearer
*NL*
sheet
of
water
permitted
,
his
keen
vision
was
bent
along
the
bald
rocks
*NL*
and
impending
forests
that
frowned
upon
the
narrow
strait
.
*NL*
*NL*
Heyward
,
who
was
a
doubly
interested
spectator
,
as
well
from
the
*NL*
beauties
of
the
place
as
from
the
apprehension
natural
to
his
situation
,
*NL*
was
just
believing
that
he
had
permitted
the
latter
to
be
excited
*NL*
without
sufficient
reason
,
when
the
paddle
ceased
moving
,
in
obedience
*NL*
to
a
signal
from
Chingachgook
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hugh
!
''
exclaimed
Uncas
,
nearly
at
the
moment
that
the
light
tap
his
*NL*
father
had
made
on
the
side
of
the
canoe
notified
them
of
the
vicinity
*NL*
of
danger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
now
?
''
asked
the
scout
;
``
the
lake
is
as
smooth
as
if
the
winds
had
*NL*
never
blown
,
and
I
can
see
along
its
sheet
for
miles
;
there
is
not
so
*NL*
much
as
the
black
head
of
a
loon
dotting
the
water
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Indian
gravely
raised
his
paddle
,
and
pointed
in
the
direction
*NL*
in
which
his
own
steady
look
was
riveted
.
Duncan
's
eyes
followed
the
*NL*
motion
.
A
few
rods
in
their
front
lay
another
of
the
wooded
islets
,
*NL*
but
it
appeared
as
calm
and
peaceful
as
if
its
solitude
had
never
been
*NL*
disturbed
by
the
foot
of
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
nothing
,
''
he
said
,
``
but
land
and
water
;
and
a
lovely
scene
it
*NL*
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hist
!
''
interrupted
the
scout
.
``
Ay
,
Sagamore
,
there
is
always
a
reason
*NL*
for
what
you
do
.
'T
is
but
a
shade
,
and
yet
it
is
not
natural
.
You
see
*NL*
the
mist
,
major
,
that
is
rising
above
the
island
;
you
ca
n't
call
it
a
*NL*
fog
,
for
it
is
more
like
a
streak
of
thin
cloud
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
vapor
from
the
water
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
a
child
could
tell
.
But
what
is
the
edging
of
blacker
smoke
*NL*
that
hangs
along
its
lower
side
,
and
which
you
may
trace
down
into
the
*NL*
thicket
of
hazel
?
'T
is
from
a
fire
;
but
one
that
,
in
my
judgment
,
has
*NL*
been
suffered
to
burn
low
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
,
then
,
push
for
the
place
,
and
relieve
our
doubts
,
''
said
the
*NL*
impatient
Duncan
;
``
the
party
must
be
small
that
can
lie
on
such
a
bit
of
*NL*
land
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
judge
of
Indian
cunning
by
the
rules
you
find
in
books
,
or
*NL*
by
white
sagacity
,
they
will
lead
you
astray
,
if
not
to
your
death
,
''
*NL*
returned
Hawkeye
,
examining
the
signs
of
the
place
with
that
acuteness
*NL*
which
distinguished
him
.
``
If
I
may
be
permitted
to
speak
in
this
matter
,
*NL*
it
will
be
to
say
,
that
we
have
but
two
things
to
choose
between
:
the
*NL*
one
is
,
to
return
,
and
give
up
all
thoughts
of
following
the
Hurons
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
!
''
exclaimed
Heyward
,
in
a
voice
far
too
loud
for
their
*NL*
circumstances
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
well
,
''
continued
Hawkeye
,
making
a
hasty
sign
to
repress
his
*NL*
impatience
;
``
I
am
much
of
your
mind
myself
;
though
I
thought
it
becoming
*NL*
my
experience
to
tell
the
whole
.
We
must
,
then
,
make
a
push
,
and
if
the
*NL*
Indians
or
Frenchers
are
in
the
narrows
,
run
the
gauntlet
through
these
*NL*
toppling
mountains
.
Is
there
reason
in
my
words
,
Sagamore
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Indian
made
no
other
answer
than
by
dropping
his
paddle
into
the
*NL*
water
,
and
urging
forward
the
canoe
.
As
he
held
the
office
of
directing
*NL*
its
course
,
his
resolution
was
sufficiently
indicated
by
the
movement
.
*NL*
The
whole
party
now
plied
their
paddles
vigorously
,
and
in
a
very
few
*NL*
moments
they
had
reached
a
point
whence
they
might
command
an
entire
*NL*
view
of
the
northern
shore
of
the
island
,
the
side
that
had
hitherto
*NL*
been
concealed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
they
are
,
by
all
the
truth
of
signs
,
''
whispered
the
scout
,
``
two
*NL*
canoes
and
a
smoke
.
The
knaves
have
n't
yet
got
their
eyes
out
of
the
*NL*
mist
,
or
we
should
hear
the
accursed
whoop
.
Together
,
friends
!
we
are
*NL*
leaving
them
,
and
are
already
nearly
out
of
whistle
of
a
bullet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
well-known
crack
of
a
rifle
,
whose
ball
came
skipping
along
the
*NL*
placid
surface
of
the
strait
,
and
a
shrill
yell
from
the
island
,
*NL*
interrupted
his
speech
,
and
announced
that
their
passage
was
discovered
.
*NL*
In
another
instant
several
savages
were
seen
rushing
into
canoes
,
which
*NL*
were
soon
dancing
over
the
water
in
pursuit
.
These
fearful
precursors
of
*NL*
a
coming
struggle
produced
no
change
in
the
countenances
and
movements
*NL*
of
his
three
guides
,
so
far
as
Duncan
could
discover
,
except
that
the
*NL*
strokes
of
their
paddles
were
longer
and
more
in
unison
,
and
caused
*NL*
the
little
bark
to
spring
forward
like
a
creature
possessing
life
and
*NL*
volition
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hold
them
there
,
Sagamore
,
''
said
Hawkeye
,
looking
coolly
backward
over
*NL*
this
left
shoulder
,
while
he
still
plied
his
paddle
;
``
keep
them
just
*NL*
there
.
Them
Hurons
have
never
a
piece
in
their
nation
that
will
execute
*NL*
at
this
distance
;
but
`
killdeer
'
has
a
barrel
on
which
a
man
may
*NL*
calculate
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
scout
having
ascertained
that
the
Mohicans
were
sufficient
of
*NL*
themselves
to
maintain
the
requisite
distance
,
deliberately
laid
aside
*NL*
his
paddle
,
and
raised
the
fatal
rifle
.
Three
several
times
he
brought
*NL*
the
piece
to
his
shoulder
,
and
when
his
companions
were
expecting
its
*NL*
report
,
he
as
often
lowered
it
to
request
the
Indians
would
permit
*NL*
their
enemies
to
approach
a
little
nigher
.
At
length
his
accurate
and
*NL*
fastidious
eye
seemed
satisfied
,
and
,
throwing
out
his
left
arm
on
the
*NL*
barrel
,
he
was
slowly
elevating
the
muzzle
,
when
an
exclamation
from
*NL*
Uncas
,
who
sat
in
the
bow
,
once
more
caused
him
to
suspend
the
shot
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
now
,
lad
?
''
demanded
Hawkeye
;
``
you
save
a
Huron
from
the
*NL*
death-shriek
by
that
word
;
have
you
reason
for
what
you
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Uncas
pointed
toward
a
rocky
shore
a
little
in
their
front
,
whence
*NL*
another
war
canoe
was
darting
directly
across
their
course
.
It
was
too
*NL*
obvious
now
that
their
situation
was
imminently
perilous
to
need
the
aid
*NL*
of
language
to
confirm
it
.
The
scout
laid
aside
his
rifle
,
and
resumed
*NL*
the
paddle
,
while
Chingachgook
inclined
the
bows
of
the
canoe
a
little
*NL*
toward
the
western
shore
,
in
order
to
increase
the
distance
between
them
*NL*
and
this
new
enemy
.
In
the
meantime
they
were
reminded
of
the
presence
*NL*
of
those
who
pressed
upon
their
rear
,
by
wild
and
exulting
shouts
.
The
*NL*
stirring
scene
awakened
even
Munro
from
his
apathy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
make
for
the
rocks
on
the
main
,
''
he
said
,
with
the
mien
of
a
*NL*
tired
soldier
,
``
and
give
battle
to
the
savages
.
God
forbid
that
I
,
or
*NL*
those
attached
to
me
and
mine
,
should
ever
trust
again
to
the
faith
of
*NL*
any
servant
of
the
Louis
's
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
who
wishes
to
prosper
in
Indian
warfare
,
''
returned
the
scout
,
``
must
*NL*
not
be
too
proud
to
learn
from
the
wit
of
a
native
.
Lay
her
more
along
*NL*
the
land
,
Sagamore
;
we
are
doubling
on
the
varlets
,
and
perhaps
they
may
*NL*
try
to
strike
our
trail
on
the
long
calculation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hawkeye
was
not
mistaken
;
for
when
the
Hurons
found
their
course
was
*NL*
likely
to
throw
them
behind
their
chase
they
rendered
it
less
direct
,
*NL*
until
,
by
gradually
bearing
more
and
more
obliquely
,
the
two
canoes
*NL*
were
,
ere
long
,
gliding
on
parallel
lines
,
within
two
hundred
yards
of
*NL*
each
other
.
It
now
became
entirely
a
trial
of
speed
.
So
rapid
was
the
*NL*
progress
of
the
light
vessels
,
that
the
lake
curled
in
their
front
,
in
*NL*
miniature
waves
,
and
their
motion
became
undulating
by
its
own
velocity
.
*NL*
It
was
,
perhaps
,
owing
to
this
circumstance
,
in
addition
to
the
*NL*
necessity
of
keeping
every
hand
employed
at
the
paddles
,
that
the
Hurons
*NL*
had
not
immediate
recourse
to
their
firearms
.
The
exertions
of
the
*NL*
fugitives
were
too
severe
to
continue
long
,
and
the
pursuers
had
the
*NL*
advantage
of
numbers
.
Duncan
observed
with
uneasiness
,
that
the
scout
*NL*
began
to
look
anxiously
about
him
,
as
if
searching
for
some
further
*NL*
means
of
assisting
their
flight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Edge
her
a
little
more
from
the
sun
,
Sagamore
,
''
said
the
stubborn
*NL*
woodsman
;
``
I
see
the
knaves
are
sparing
a
man
to
the
rifle
.
A
single
*NL*
broken
bone
might
lose
us
our
scalps
.
Edge
more
from
the
sun
and
we
will
*NL*
put
the
island
between
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
expedient
was
not
without
its
use
.
A
long
,
low
island
lay
at
a
*NL*
little
distance
before
them
,
and
,
as
they
closed
with
it
,
the
chasing
*NL*
canoe
was
compelled
to
take
a
side
opposite
to
that
on
which
the
pursued
*NL*
passed
.
The
scout
and
his
companions
did
not
neglect
this
advantage
,
but
*NL*
the
instant
they
were
hid
from
observation
by
the
bushes
,
they
redoubled
*NL*
efforts
that
before
had
seemed
prodigious
.
The
two
canoes
came
round
*NL*
the
last
low
point
,
like
two
coursers
at
the
top
of
their
speed
,
the
*NL*
fugitives
taking
the
lead
.
This
change
had
brought
them
nigher
to
each
*NL*
other
,
however
,
while
it
altered
their
relative
positions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
showed
knowledge
in
the
shaping
of
a
birchen
bark
,
Uncas
,
when
*NL*
you
chose
this
from
among
the
Huron
canoes
,
''
said
the
scout
,
smiling
,
*NL*
apparently
more
in
satisfaction
at
their
superiority
in
the
race
than
*NL*
from
that
prospect
of
final
escape
which
now
began
to
open
a
little
upon
*NL*
them
.
``
The
imps
have
put
all
their
strength
again
at
the
paddles
,
and
we
*NL*
are
to
struggle
for
our
scalps
with
bits
of
flattened
wood
,
instead
of
*NL*
clouded
barrels
and
true
eyes
.
A
long
stroke
,
and
together
,
friends
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
preparing
for
a
shot
,
''
said
Heyward
;
``
and
as
we
are
in
a
line
*NL*
with
them
,
it
can
scarcely
fail
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Get
you
,
then
,
into
the
bottom
of
the
canoe
,
''
returned
the
scout
;
``
you
*NL*
and
the
colonel
;
it
will
be
so
much
taken
from
the
size
of
the
mark
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Heyward
smiled
,
as
he
answered
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
be
but
an
ill
example
for
the
highest
in
rank
to
dodge
,
while
*NL*
the
warriors
were
under
fire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lord
!
Lord
!
That
is
now
a
white
man
's
courage
!
''
exclaimed
the
scout
;
*NL*
``
and
like
to
many
of
his
notions
,
not
to
be
maintained
by
reason
.
Do
you
*NL*
think
the
Sagamore
,
or
Uncas
,
or
even
I
,
who
am
a
man
without
a
cross
,
*NL*
would
deliberate
about
finding
a
cover
in
the
scrimmage
,
when
an
open
*NL*
body
would
do
no
good
?
For
what
have
the
Frenchers
reared
up
their
*NL*
Quebec
,
if
fighting
is
always
to
be
done
in
the
clearings
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
that
you
say
is
very
true
,
my
friend
,
''
replied
Heyward
;
``
still
,
our
*NL*
customs
must
prevent
us
from
doing
as
you
wish
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
volley
from
the
Hurons
interrupted
the
discourse
,
and
as
the
bullets
*NL*
whistled
about
them
,
Duncan
saw
the
head
of
Uncas
turned
,
looking
back
*NL*
at
himself
and
Munro
.
Notwithstanding
the
nearness
of
the
enemy
,
and
*NL*
his
own
great
personal
danger
,
the
countenance
of
the
young
warrior
*NL*
expressed
no
other
emotion
,
as
the
former
was
compelled
to
think
,
than
*NL*
amazement
at
finding
men
willing
to
encounter
so
useless
an
exposure
.
*NL*
Chingachgook
was
probably
better
acquainted
with
the
notions
of
white
*NL*
men
,
for
he
did
not
even
cast
a
glance
aside
from
the
riveted
look
his
*NL*
eye
maintained
on
the
object
by
which
he
governed
their
course
.
A
ball
*NL*
soon
struck
the
light
and
polished
paddle
from
the
hands
of
the
chief
,
*NL*
and
drove
it
through
the
air
,
far
in
the
advance
.
A
shout
arose
from
*NL*
the
Hurons
,
who
seized
the
opportunity
to
fire
another
volley
.
Uncas
*NL*
described
an
arc
in
the
water
with
his
own
blade
,
and
as
the
canoe
*NL*
passed
swiftly
on
,
Chingachgook
recovered
his
paddle
,
and
flourishing
*NL*
it
on
high
,
he
gave
the
war-whoop
of
the
Mohicans
,
and
then
lent
his
*NL*
strength
and
skill
again
to
the
important
task
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
clamorous
sounds
of
``
Le
Gros
Serpent
!
''
``
La
Longue
Carabine
!
''
``
Le
*NL*
Cerf
Agile
!
''
burst
at
once
from
the
canoes
behind
,
and
seemed
to
give
*NL*
new
zeal
to
the
pursuers
.
The
scout
seized
``
killdeer
''
in
his
left
hand
,
*NL*
and
elevating
it
about
his
head
,
he
shook
it
in
triumph
at
his
enemies
.
*NL*
The
savages
answered
the
insult
with
a
yell
,
and
immediately
another
*NL*
volley
succeeded
.
The
bullets
pattered
along
the
lake
,
and
one
even
*NL*
pierced
the
bark
of
their
little
vessel
.
No
perceptible
emotion
could
*NL*
be
discovered
in
the
Mohicans
during
this
critical
moment
,
their
rigid
*NL*
features
expressing
neither
hope
nor
alarm
;
but
the
scout
again
turned
*NL*
his
head
,
and
,
laughing
in
his
own
silent
manner
,
he
said
to
Heyward
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
knaves
love
to
hear
the
sounds
of
their
pieces
;
but
the
eye
is
*NL*
not
to
be
found
among
the
Mingoes
that
can
calculate
a
true
range
in
a
*NL*
dancing
canoe
!
You
see
the
dumb
devils
have
taken
off
a
man
to
charge
,
*NL*
and
by
the
smallest
measurement
that
can
be
allowed
,
we
move
three
feet
*NL*
to
their
two
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Duncan
,
who
was
not
altogether
as
easy
under
this
nice
estimate
of
*NL*
distances
as
his
companions
,
was
glad
to
find
,
however
,
that
owing
to
*NL*
their
superior
dexterity
,
and
the
diversion
among
their
enemies
,
they
*NL*
were
very
sensibly
obtaining
the
advantage
.
The
Hurons
soon
fired
again
,
*NL*
and
a
bullet
struck
the
blade
of
Hawkeye
's
paddle
without
injury
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
will
do
,
''
said
the
scout
,
examining
the
slight
indentation
with
a
*NL*
curious
eye
;
``
it
would
not
have
cut
the
skin
of
an
infant
,
much
less
of
*NL*
men
,
who
,
like
us
,
have
been
blown
upon
by
the
heavens
in
their
anger
.
*NL*
Now
,
major
,
if
you
will
try
to
use
this
piece
of
flattened
wood
,
I
'll
*NL*
let
`
killdeer
'
take
a
part
in
the
conversation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Heyward
seized
the
paddle
,
and
applied
himself
to
the
work
with
an
*NL*
eagerness
that
supplied
the
place
of
skill
,
while
Hawkeye
was
engaged
*NL*
in
inspecting
the
priming
of
his
rifle
.
The
latter
then
took
a
swift
aim
*NL*
and
fired
.
The
Huron
in
the
bows
of
the
leading
canoe
had
risen
with
a
*NL*
similar
object
,
and
he
now
fell
backward
,
suffering
his
gun
to
escape
*NL*
from
his
hands
into
the
water
.
In
an
instant
,
however
,
he
recovered
his
*NL*
feet
,
though
his
gestures
were
wild
and
bewildered
.
At
the
same
moment
*NL*
his
companions
suspended
their
efforts
,
and
the
chasing
canoes
clustered
*NL*
together
,
and
became
stationary
.
Chingachgook
and
Uncas
profited
by
the
*NL*
interval
to
regain
their
wind
,
though
Duncan
continued
to
work
with
*NL*
the
most
persevering
industry
.
The
father
and
son
now
cast
calm
but
*NL*
inquiring
glances
at
each
other
,
to
learn
if
either
had
sustained
any
*NL*
injury
by
the
fire
;
for
both
well
knew
that
no
cry
or
exclamation
*NL*
would
,
in
such
a
moment
of
necessity
have
been
permitted
to
betray
the
*NL*
accident
.
A
few
large
drops
of
blood
were
trickling
down
the
shoulder
*NL*
of
the
Sagamore
,
who
,
when
he
perceived
that
the
eyes
of
Uncas
dwelt
*NL*
too
long
on
the
sight
,
raised
some
water
in
the
hollow
of
his
hand
,
and
*NL*
washing
off
the
stain
,
was
content
to
manifest
,
in
this
simple
manner
,
*NL*
the
slightness
of
the
injury
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Softly
,
softly
,
major
,
''
said
the
scout
,
who
by
this
time
had
reloaded

``
we
are
a
little
too
far
already

put
forth
its

beauties

and
you
see
yonder
imps
are
holding
a
council
.
Let
them
*NL*
come
up
within
striking
distance
--
my
eye
may
well
be
trusted
in
such
*NL*
a
matter

and
I
will
trail
the
varlets
the
length
of
the
Horican
,
*NL*
guaranteeing
that
not
a
shot
of
theirs
shall
,
at
the
worst
,
more
than
*NL*
break
the
skin
,
while
`
killdeer
'
shall
touch
the
life
twice
in
three
*NL*
times
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
forget
our
errand
,
''
returned
the
diligent
Duncan
.
``
For
God
's
sake
*NL*
let
us
profit
by
this
advantage
,
and
increase
our
distance
from
the
*NL*
enemy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
me
my
children
,
''
said
Munro
,
hoarsely
;
``
trifle
no
longer
with
a
*NL*
father
's
agony
,
but
restore
me
my
babes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Long
and
habitual
deference
to
the
mandates
of
his
superiors
had
taught
*NL*
the
scout
the
virtue
of
obedience
.
Throwing
a
last
and
lingering
glance
*NL*
at
the
distant
canoes
,
he
laid
aside
his
rifle
,
and
,
relieving
the
*NL*
wearied
Duncan
,
resumed
the
paddle
,
which
he
wielded
with
sinews
that
*NL*
never
tired
.
His
efforts
were
seconded
by
those
of
the
Mohicans
and
a
*NL*
very
few
minutes
served
to
place
such
a
sheet
of
water
between
them
and
*NL*
their
enemies
,
that
Heyward
once
more
breathed
freely
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
lake
now
began
to
expand
,
and
their
route
lay
along
a
wide
reach
,
*NL*
that
was
lined
,
as
before
,
by
high
and
ragged
mountains
.
But
the
islands
*NL*
were
few
,
and
easily
avoided
.
The
strokes
of
the
paddles
grew
more
*NL*
measured
and
regular
,
while
they
who
plied
them
continued
their
labor
,
*NL*
after
the
close
and
deadly
chase
from
which
they
had
just
relieved
*NL*
themselves
,
with
as
much
coolness
as
though
their
speed
had
been
tried
*NL*
in
sport
,
rather
than
under
such
pressing
,
nay
,
almost
desperate
,
*NL*
circumstances
.
*NL*
*NL*
Instead
of
following
the
western
shore
,
whither
their
errand
led
them
,
*NL*
the
wary
Mohican
inclined
his
course
more
toward
those
hills
behind
*NL*
which
Montcalm
was
known
to
have
led
his
army
into
the
formidable
*NL*
fortress
of
Ticonderoga
.
As
the
Hurons
,
to
every
appearance
,
had
*NL*
abandoned
the
pursuit
,
there
was
no
apparent
reason
for
this
excess
of
*NL*
caution
.
It
was
,
however
,
maintained
for
hours
,
until
they
had
reached
*NL*
a
bay
,
nigh
the
northern
termination
of
the
lake
.
Here
the
canoe
was
*NL*
driven
upon
the
beach
,
and
the
whole
party
landed
.
Hawkeye
and
Heyward
*NL*
ascended
an
adjacent
bluff
,
where
the
former
,
after
considering
the
*NL*
expanse
of
water
beneath
him
,
pointed
out
to
the
latter
a
small
black
*NL*
object
,
hovering
under
a
headland
,
at
the
distance
of
several
miles
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
see
it
?
''
demanded
the
scout
.
``
Now
,
what
would
you
account
that
*NL*
spot
,
were
you
left
alone
to
white
experience
to
find
your
way
through
*NL*
this
wilderness
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
for
its
distance
and
its
magnitude
,
I
should
suppose
it
a
bird
.
Can
*NL*
it
be
a
living
object
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
a
canoe
of
good
birchen
bark
,
and
paddled
by
fierce
and
crafty
*NL*
Mingoes
.
Though
Providence
has
lent
to
those
who
inhabit
the
woods
*NL*
eyes
that
would
be
needless
to
men
in
the
settlements
,
where
there
are
*NL*
inventions
to
assist
the
sight
,
yet
no
human
organs
can
see
all
the
*NL*
dangers
which
at
this
moment
circumvent
us
.
These
varlets
pretend
to
be
*NL*
bent
chiefly
on
their
sun-down
meal
,
but
the
moment
it
is
dark
they
will
*NL*
be
on
our
trail
,
as
true
as
hounds
on
the
scent
.
We
must
throw
them
*NL*
off
,
or
our
pursuit
of
Le
Renard
Subtil
may
be
given
up
.
These
lakes
are
*NL*
useful
at
times
,
especially
when
the
game
take
the
water
,
''
continued
the
*NL*
scout
,
gazing
about
him
with
a
countenance
of
concern
;
``
but
they
give
no
*NL*
cover
,
except
it
be
to
the
fishes
.
God
knows
what
the
country
would
*NL*
be
,
if
the
settlements
should
ever
spread
far
from
the
two
rivers
.
Both
*NL*
hunting
and
war
would
lose
their
beauty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
not
delay
a
moment
,
without
some
good
and
obvious
cause
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
little
like
that
smoke
,
which
you
may
see
worming
up
along
the
rock
*NL*
above
the
canoe
,
''
interrupted
the
abstracted
scout
.
``
My
life
on
it
,
*NL*
other
eyes
than
ours
see
it
,
and
know
its
meaning
.
Well
,
words
will
not
*NL*
mend
the
matter
,
and
it
is
time
that
we
were
doing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hawkeye
moved
away
from
the
lookout
,
and
descended
,
musing
profoundly
,
*NL*
to
the
shore
.
He
communicated
the
result
of
his
observations
to
his
*NL*
companions
,
in
Delaware
,
and
a
short
and
earnest
consultation
succeeded
.
*NL*
When
it
terminated
,
the
three
instantly
set
about
executing
their
new
*NL*
resolutions
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
canoe
was
lifted
from
the
water
,
and
borne
on
the
shoulders
of
the
*NL*
party
,
they
proceeded
into
the
wood
,
making
as
broad
and
obvious
a
trail
*NL*
as
possible
.
They
soon
reached
the
water-course
,
which
they
crossed
,
*NL*
and
,
continuing
onward
,
until
they
came
to
an
extensive
and
naked
rock
.
*NL*
At
this
point
,
where
their
footsteps
might
be
expected
to
be
no
longer
*NL*
visible
,
they
retraced
their
route
to
the
brook
,
walking
backward
,
with
*NL*
the
utmost
care
.
They
now
followed
the
bed
of
the
little
stream
to
the
*NL*
lake
,
into
which
they
immediately
launched
their
canoe
again
.
A
low
*NL*
point
concealed
them
from
the
headland
,
and
the
margin
of
the
lake
was
*NL*
fringed
for
some
distance
with
dense
and
overhanging
bushes
.
Under
the
*NL*
cover
of
these
natural
advantages
,
they
toiled
their
way
,
with
patient
*NL*
industry
,
until
the
scout
pronounced
that
he
believed
it
would
be
safe
*NL*
once
more
to
land
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
halt
continued
until
evening
rendered
objects
indistinct
and
*NL*
uncertain
to
the
eye
.
Then
they
resumed
their
route
,
and
,
favored
by
*NL*
the
darkness
,
pushed
silently
and
vigorously
toward
the
western
shore
.
*NL*
Although
the
rugged
outline
of
mountain
,
to
which
they
were
steering
,
*NL*
presented
no
distinctive
marks
to
the
eyes
of
Duncan
,
the
Mohican
*NL*
entered
the
little
haven
he
had
selected
with
the
confidence
and
*NL*
accuracy
of
an
experienced
pilot
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
boat
was
again
lifted
and
borne
into
the
woods
,
where
it
was
*NL*
carefully
concealed
under
a
pile
of
brush
.
The
adventurers
assumed
their
*NL*
arms
and
packs
,
and
the
scout
announced
to
Munro
and
Heyward
that
he
and
*NL*
the
Indians
were
at
last
in
readiness
to
proceed
.

CHAPTER
21

*NL*
``
If
you
find
a
man
there
,
he
shall
die
a
flea
's
death
.
''
*NL*
--
Merry
Wives
of
Windsor
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
party
had
landed
on
the
border
of
a
region
that
is
,
even
to
this
*NL*
day
,
less
known
to
the
inhabitants
of
the
States
than
the
deserts
*NL*
of
Arabia
,
or
the
steppes
of
Tartary
.
It
was
the
sterile
and
rugged
*NL*
district
which
separates
the
tributaries
of
Champlain
from
those
of
the
*NL*
Hudson
,
the
Mohawk
,
and
the
St.
Lawrence
.
Since
the
period
of
our
tale
*NL*
the
active
spirit
of
the
country
has
surrounded
it
with
a
belt
of
rich
*NL*
and
thriving
settlements
,
though
none
but
the
hunter
or
the
savage
is
*NL*
ever
known
even
now
to
penetrate
its
wild
recesses
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
Hawkeye
and
the
Mohicans
had
,
however
,
often
traversed
the
mountains
*NL*
and
valleys
of
this
vast
wilderness
,
they
did
not
hesitate
to
plunge
*NL*
into
its
depth
,
with
the
freedom
of
men
accustomed
to
its
privations
*NL*
and
difficulties
.
For
many
hours
the
travelers
toiled
on
their
laborious
*NL*
way
,
guided
by
a
star
,
or
following
the
direction
of
some
water-course
,
*NL*
until
the
scout
called
a
halt
,
and
holding
a
short
consultation
with
*NL*
the
Indians
,
they
lighted
their
fire
,
and
made
the
usual
preparations
to
*NL*
pass
the
remainder
of
the
night
where
they
then
were
.
*NL*
*NL*
Imitating
the
example
,
and
emulating
the
confidence
of
their
more
*NL*
experienced
associates
,
Munro
and
Duncan
slept
without
fear
,
if
not
*NL*
without
uneasiness
.
The
dews
were
suffered
to
exhale
,
and
the
sun
had
*NL*
dispersed
the
mists
,
and
was
shedding
a
strong
and
clear
light
in
the
*NL*
forest
,
when
the
travelers
resumed
their
journey
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
proceeding
a
few
miles
,
the
progress
of
Hawkeye
,
who
led
the
*NL*
advance
,
became
more
deliberate
and
watchful
.
He
often
stopped
to
*NL*
examine
the
trees
;
nor
did
he
cross
a
rivulet
without
attentively
*NL*
considering
the
quantity
,
the
velocity
,
and
the
color
of
its
waters
.
*NL*
Distrusting
his
own
judgment
,
his
appeals
to
the
opinion
of
Chingachgook
*NL*
were
frequent
and
earnest
.
During
one
of
these
conferences
Heyward
*NL*
observed
that
Uncas
stood
a
patient
and
silent
,
though
,
as
he
imagined
,
*NL*
an
interested
listener
.
He
was
strongly
tempted
to
address
the
young
*NL*
chief
,
and
demand
his
opinion
of
their
progress
;
but
the
calm
and
*NL*
dignified
demeanor
of
the
native
induced
him
to
believe
,
that
,
like
*NL*
himself
,
the
other
was
wholly
dependent
on
the
sagacity
and
intelligence
*NL*
of
the
seniors
of
the
party
.
At
last
the
scout
spoke
in
English
,
and
at
*NL*
once
explained
the
embarrassment
of
their
situation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
I
found
that
the
home
path
of
the
Hurons
run
north
,
''
he
said
,
``
it
*NL*
did
not
need
the
judgment
of
many
long
years
to
tell
that
they
would
*NL*
follow
the
valleys
,
and
keep
atween
the
waters
of
the
Hudson
and
the
*NL*
Horican
,
until
they
might
strike
the
springs
of
the
Canada
streams
,
*NL*
which
would
lead
them
into
the
heart
of
the
country
of
the
Frenchers
.
*NL*
Yet
here
are
we
,
within
a
short
range
of
the
Scaroons
,
and
not
a
sign
of
*NL*
a
trail
have
we
crossed
!
Human
natur
'
is
weak
,
and
it
is
possible
we
may
*NL*
not
have
taken
the
proper
scent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Heaven
protect
us
from
such
an
error
!
''
exclaimed
Duncan
.
``
Let
us
*NL*
retrace
our
steps
,
and
examine
as
we
go
,
with
keener
eyes
.
Has
Uncas
no
*NL*
counsel
to
offer
in
such
a
strait
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
Mohican
cast
a
glance
at
his
father
,
but
,
maintaining
his
*NL*
quiet
and
reserved
mien
,
he
continued
silent
.
Chingachgook
had
caught
*NL*
the
look
,
and
motioning
with
his
hand
,
he
bade
him
speak
.
The
moment
*NL*
this
permission
was
accorded
,
the
countenance
of
Uncas
changed
from
its
*NL*
grave
composure
to
a
gleam
of
intelligence
and
joy
.
Bounding
forward
*NL*
like
a
deer
,
he
sprang
up
the
side
of
a
little
acclivity
,
a
few
rods
in
*NL*
advance
,
and
stood
,
exultingly
,
over
a
spot
of
fresh
earth
,
that
looked
*NL*
as
though
it
had
been
recently
upturned
by
the
passage
of
some
heavy
*NL*
animal
.
The
eyes
of
the
whole
party
followed
the
unexpected
movement
,
*NL*
and
read
their
success
in
the
air
of
triumph
that
the
youth
assumed
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
the
trail
!
''
exclaimed
the
scout
,
advancing
to
the
spot
;
``
the
lad
*NL*
is
quick
of
sight
and
keen
of
wit
for
his
years
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
extraordinary
that
he
should
have
withheld
his
knowledge
so
long
,
''
*NL*
muttered
Duncan
,
at
his
elbow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
have
been
more
wonderful
had
he
spoken
without
a
bidding
.
*NL*
No
,
no
;
your
young
white
,
who
gathers
his
learning
from
books
and
can
*NL*
measure
what
he
knows
by
the
page
,
may
conceit
that
his
knowledge
,
like
*NL*
his
legs
,
outruns
that
of
his
fathers
'
,
but
,
where
experience
is
the
*NL*
master
,
the
scholar
is
made
to
know
the
value
of
years
,
and
respects
*NL*
them
accordingly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
See
!
''
said
Uncas
,
pointing
north
and
south
,
at
the
evident
marks
of
the
*NL*
broad
trail
on
either
side
of
him
,
``
the
dark-hair
has
gone
toward
the
*NL*
forest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hound
never
ran
on
a
more
beautiful
scent

''
responded
the
scout
,
*NL*
dashing
forward
,
at
once
,
on
the
indicated
route
;
``
we
are
favored
,
*NL*
greatly
favored
,
and
can
follow
with
high
noses
.
Ay
,
here
are
both
your
*NL*
waddling
beasts
:
this
Huron
travels
like
a
white
general
.
The
fellow
is
*NL*
stricken
with
a
judgment
,
and
is
mad
!
Look
sharp
for
wheels
,
Sagamore
,
''
*NL*
he
continued
,
looking
back
,
and
laughing
in
his
newly
awakened
*NL*
satisfaction
;
``
we
shall
soon
have
the
fool
journeying
in
a
coach
,
and
*NL*
that
with
three
of
the
best
pair
of
eyes
on
the
borders
in
his
rear

*NL*
*NL*
The
spirits
of
the
scout
,
and
the
astonishing
success
of
the
chase
,
in
*NL*
which
a
circuitous
distance
of
more
than
forty
miles
had
been
passed
,
*NL*
did
not
fail
to
impart
a
portion
of
hope
to
the
whole
party
.
Their
*NL*
advance
was
rapid
;
and
made
with
as
much
confidence
as
a
traveler
would
*NL*
proceed
along
a
wide
highway
.
If
a
rock
,
or
a
rivulet
,
or
a
bit
of
earth
*NL*
harder
than
common
,
severed
the
links
of
the
clew
they
followed
,
the
*NL*
true
eye
of
the
scout
recovered
them
at
a
distance
,
and
seldom
rendered
*NL*
the
delay
of
a
single
moment
necessary
.
Their
progress
was
much
*NL*
facilitated
by
the
certainty
that
Magua
had
found
it
necessary
to
*NL*
journey
through
the
valleys
;
a
circumstance
which
rendered
the
general
*NL*
direction
of
the
route
sure
.
Nor
had
the
Huron
entirely
neglected
the
*NL*
arts
uniformly
practised
by
the
natives
when
retiring
in
front
of
an
*NL*
enemy
.
False
trails
and
sudden
turnings
were
frequent
,
wherever
a
brook
*NL*
or
the
formation
of
the
ground
rendered
them
feasible
;
but
his
pursuers
*NL*
were
rarely
deceived
,
and
never
failed
to
detect
their
error
,
before
*NL*
they
had
lost
either
time
or
distance
on
the
deceptive
track
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
they
had
passed
the
Scaroons
,
and
were
*NL*
following
the
route
of
the
declining
sun
.
After
descending
an
eminence
*NL*
to
a
low
bottom
,
through
which
a
swift
stream
glided
,
they
suddenly
came
*NL*
to
a
place
where
the
party
of
Le
Renard
had
made
a
halt
.
Extinguished
*NL*
brands
were
lying
around
a
spring
,
the
offals
of
a
deer
were
scattered
*NL*
about
the
place
,
and
the
trees
bore
evident
marks
of
having
been
*NL*
browsed
by
the
horses
.
At
a
little
distance
,
Heyward
discovered
,
and
*NL*
contemplated
with
tender
emotion
,
the
small
bower
under
which
he
was
*NL*
fain
to
believe
that
Cora
and
Alice
had
reposed
.
But
while
the
earth
*NL*
was
trodden
,
and
the
footsteps
of
both
men
and
beasts
were
so
plainly
*NL*
visible
around
the
place
,
the
trail
appeared
to
have
suddenly
ended
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
easy
to
follow
the
tracks
of
the
Narragansetts
,
but
they
seemed
*NL*
only
to
have
wandered
without
guides
,
or
any
other
object
than
the
*NL*
pursuit
of
food
.
At
length
Uncas
,
who
,
with
his
father
,
had
endeavored
*NL*
to
trace
the
route
of
the
horses
,
came
upon
a
sign
of
their
presence
*NL*
that
was
quite
recent
.
Before
following
the
clew
,
he
communicated
his
*NL*
success
to
his
companions
;
and
while
the
latter
were
consulting
on
the
*NL*
circumstance
,
the
youth
reappeared
,
leading
the
two
fillies
,
with
*NL*
their
saddles
broken
,
and
the
housings
soiled
,
as
though
they
had
been
*NL*
permitted
to
run
at
will
for
several
days
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
should
this
prove
?
''
said
Duncan
,
turning
pale
,
and
glancing
his
*NL*
eyes
around
him
,
as
if
he
feared
the
brush
and
leaves
were
about
to
give
*NL*
up
some
horrid
secret
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
our
march
is
come
to
a
quick
end
,
and
that
we
are
in
an
enemy
's
*NL*
country
,
''
returned
the
scout
.
``
Had
the
knave
been
pressed
,
and
the
*NL*
gentle
ones
wanted
horses
to
keep
up
with
the
party
,
he
might
have
taken
*NL*
their
scalps
;
but
without
an
enemy
at
his
heels
,
and
with
such
rugged
*NL*
beasts
as
these
,
he
would
not
hurt
a
hair
of
their
heads
.
I
know
your
*NL*
thoughts
,
and
shame
be
it
to
our
color
that
you
have
reason
for
them
;
*NL*
but
he
who
thinks
that
even
a
Mingo
would
ill-treat
a
woman
,
unless
it
*NL*
be
to
tomahawk
her
,
knows
nothing
of
Indian
natur
'
,
or
the
laws
of
the
*NL*
woods
.
No
,
no
;
I
have
heard
that
the
French
Indians
had
come
into
these
*NL*
hills
to
hunt
the
moose
,
and
we
are
getting
within
scent
of
their
camp
.
*NL*
Why
should
they
not
?
The
morning
and
evening
guns
of
Ty
may
be
heard
*NL*
any
day
among
these
mountains
;
for
the
Frenchers
are
running
a
new
line
*NL*
atween
the
provinces
of
the
king
and
the
Canadas
.
It
is
true
that
the
*NL*
horses
are
here
,
but
the
Hurons
are
gone
;
let
us
,
then
,
hunt
for
the
*NL*
path
by
which
they
parted
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hawkeye
and
the
Mohicans
now
applied
themselves
to
their
task
in
good
*NL*
earnest
.
A
circle
of
a
few
hundred
feet
in
circumference
was
drawn
,
*NL*
and
each
of
the
party
took
a
segment
for
his
portion
.
The
examination
,
*NL*
however
,
resulted
in
no
discovery
.
The
impressions
of
footsteps
were
*NL*
numerous
,
but
they
all
appeared
like
those
of
men
who
had
wandered
*NL*
about
the
spot
,
without
any
design
to
quit
it
.
Again
the
scout
and
his
*NL*
companions
made
the
circuit
of
the
halting
place
,
each
slowly
following
*NL*
the
other
,
until
they
assembled
in
the
center
once
more
,
no
wiser
than
*NL*
when
they
started
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Such
cunning
is
not
without
its
deviltry
,
''
exclaimed
Hawkeye
,
when
he
*NL*
met
the
disappointed
looks
of
his
assistants
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
must
get
down
to
it
,
Sagamore
,
beginning
at
the
spring
,
and
going
*NL*
over
the
ground
by
inches
.
The
Huron
shall
never
brag
in
his
tribe
that
*NL*
he
has
a
foot
which
leaves
no
print
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Setting
the
example
himself
,
the
scout
engaged
in
the
scrutiny
with
*NL*
renewed
zeal
.
Not
a
leaf
was
left
unturned
.
The
sticks
were
removed
,
*NL*
and
the
stones
lifted
;
for
Indian
cunning
was
known
frequently
to
adopt
*NL*
these
objects
as
covers
,
laboring
with
the
utmost
patience
and
industry
,
*NL*
to
conceal
each
footstep
as
they
proceeded
.
Still
no
discovery
was
made
.
*NL*
At
length
Uncas
,
whose
activity
had
enabled
him
to
achieve
his
portion
*NL*
of
the
task
the
soonest
,
raked
the
earth
across
the
turbid
little
rill
*NL*
which
ran
from
the
spring
,
and
diverted
its
course
into
another
channel
.
*NL*
So
soon
as
its
narrow
bed
below
the
dam
was
dry
,
he
stooped
over
it
with
*NL*
keen
and
curious
eyes
.
A
cry
of
exultation
immediately
announced
the
*NL*
success
of
the
young
warrior
.
The
whole
party
crowded
to
the
spot
where
*NL*
Uncas
pointed
out
the
impression
of
a
moccasin
in
the
moist
alluvion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
lad
will
be
an
honor
to
his
people
,
''
said
Hawkeye
,
regarding
the
*NL*
trail
with
as
much
admiration
as
a
naturalist
would
expend
on
the
tusk
*NL*
of
a
mammoth
or
the
rib
of
a
mastodon
;
``
ay
,
and
a
thorn
in
the
sides
of
*NL*
the
Hurons
.
Yet
that
is
not
the
footstep
of
an
Indian
!
the
weight
is
too
*NL*
much
on
the
heel
,
and
the
toes
are
squared
,
as
though
one
of
the
French
*NL*
dancers
had
been
in
,
pigeon-winging
his
tribe
!
Run
back
,
Uncas
,
and
*NL*
bring
me
the
size
of
the
singer
's
foot
.
You
will
find
a
beautiful
print
*NL*
of
it
just
opposite
yon
rock
,
agin
the
hillside
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
the
youth
was
engaged
in
this
commission
,
the
scout
and
*NL*
Chingachgook
were
attentively
considering
the
impressions
.
The
*NL*
measurements
agreed
,
and
the
former
unhesitatingly
pronounced
that
the
*NL*
footstep
was
that
of
David
,
who
had
once
more
been
made
to
exchange
his
*NL*
shoes
for
moccasins
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
now
read
the
whole
of
it
,
as
plainly
as
if
I
had
seen
the
arts
of
*NL*
Le
Subtil
,
''
he
added
;
``
the
singer
being
a
man
whose
gifts
lay
chiefly
in
*NL*
his
throat
and
feet
,
was
made
to
go
first
,
and
the
others
have
trod
in
*NL*
his
steps
,
imitating
their
formation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
''
cried
Duncan
,
``
I
see
no
signs
of
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
gentle
ones
,
''
interrupted
the
scout
;
``
the
varlet
has
found
a
way
to
*NL*
carry
them
,
until
he
supposed
he
had
thrown
any
followers
off
the
scent
.
*NL*
My
life
on
it
,
we
see
their
pretty
little
feet
again
,
before
many
rods
*NL*
go
by
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
whole
party
now
proceeded
,
following
the
course
of
the
rill
,
keeping
*NL*
anxious
eyes
on
the
regular
impressions
.
The
water
soon
flowed
into
its
*NL*
bed
again
,
but
watching
the
ground
on
either
side
,
the
foresters
pursued
*NL*
their
way
content
with
knowing
that
the
trail
lay
beneath
.
More
than
*NL*
half
a
mile
was
passed
,
before
the
rill
rippled
close
around
the
base
of
*NL*
an
extensive
and
dry
rock
.
Here
they
paused
to
make
sure
that
the
Hurons
*NL*
had
not
quitted
the
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
fortunate
they
did
so
.
For
the
quick
and
active
Uncas
soon
found
*NL*
the
impression
of
a
foot
on
a
bunch
of
moss
,
where
it
would
seem
an
*NL*
Indian
had
inadvertently
trodden
.
Pursuing
the
direction
given
by
this
*NL*
discovery
,
he
entered
the
neighboring
thicket
,
and
struck
the
trail
,
as
*NL*
fresh
and
obvious
as
it
had
been
before
they
reached
the
spring
.
Another
*NL*
shout
announced
the
good
fortune
of
the
youth
to
his
companions
,
and
at
*NL*
once
terminated
the
search
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
it
has
been
planned
with
Indian
judgment
,
''
said
the
scout
,
when
*NL*
the
party
was
assembled
around
the
place
,
``
and
would
have
blinded
white
*NL*
eyes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
we
proceed
?
''
demanded
Heyward
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Softly
,
softly
,
we
know
our
path
;
but
it
is
good
to
examine
the
*NL*
formation
of
things
.
This
is
my
schooling
,
major
;
and
if
one
neglects
*NL*
the
book
,
there
is
little
chance
of
learning
from
the
open
land
of
*NL*
Providence
.
All
is
plain
but
one
thing
,
which
is
the
manner
that
the
*NL*
knave
contrived
to
get
the
gentle
ones
along
the
blind
trail
.
Even
a
*NL*
Huron
would
be
too
proud
to
let
their
tender
feet
touch
the
water
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
this
assist
in
explaining
the
difficulty
?
''
said
Heyward
,
pointing
*NL*
toward
the
fragments
of
a
sort
of
handbarrow
,
that
had
been
rudely
*NL*
constructed
of
boughs
,
and
bound
together
with
withes
,
and
which
now
*NL*
seemed
carelessly
cast
aside
as
useless
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
explained
!
''
cried
the
delighted
Hawkeye
.
``
If
them
varlets
have
*NL*
passed
a
minute
,
they
have
spent
hours
in
striving
to
fabricate
a
lying
*NL*
end
to
their
trail
!
Well
,
I
've
known
them
to
waste
a
day
in
the
same
*NL*
manner
to
as
little
purpose
.
Here
we
have
three
pair
of
moccasins
,
and
*NL*
two
of
little
feet
.
It
is
amazing
that
any
mortal
beings
can
journey
on
*NL*
limbs
so
small
!
Pass
me
the
thong
of
buckskin
,
Uncas
,
and
let
me
take
*NL*
the
length
of
this
foot
.
By
the
Lord
,
it
is
no
longer
than
a
child
's
and
*NL*
yet
the
maidens
are
tall
and
comely
.
That
Providence
is
partial
in
its
*NL*
gifts
,
for
its
own
wise
reasons
,
the
best
and
most
contented
of
us
must
*NL*
allow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
tender
limbs
of
my
daughters
are
unequal
to
these
hardships
,
''
said
*NL*
Munro
,
looking
at
the
light
footsteps
of
his
children
,
with
a
parent
's
*NL*
love
;
``
we
shall
find
their
fainting
forms
in
this
desert
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
that
there
is
little
cause
of
fear
,
''
returned
the
scout
,
slowly
*NL*
shaking
his
head
;
``
this
is
a
firm
and
straight
,
though
a
light
step
,
and
*NL*
not
over
long
.
See
,
the
heel
has
hardly
touched
the
ground
;
and
there
*NL*
the
dark-hair
has
made
a
little
jump
,
from
root
to
root
.
No
,
no
;
my
*NL*
knowledge
for
it
,
neither
of
them
was
nigh
fainting
,
hereaway
.
Now
,
the
*NL*
singer
was
beginning
to
be
footsore
and
leg-weary
,
as
is
plain
by
*NL*
his
trail
.
There
,
you
see
,
he
slipped
;
here
he
has
traveled
wide
and
*NL*
tottered
;
and
there
again
it
looks
as
though
he
journeyed
on
snowshoes
.
*NL*
Ay
,
ay
,
a
man
who
uses
his
throat
altogether
,
can
hardly
give
his
legs
a
*NL*
proper
training
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
From
such
undeniable
testimony
did
the
practised
woodsman
arrive
at
the
*NL*
truth
,
with
nearly
as
much
certainty
and
precision
as
if
he
had
been
a
*NL*
witness
of
all
those
events
which
his
ingenuity
so
easily
elucidated
.
*NL*
Cheered
by
these
assurances
,
and
satisfied
by
a
reasoning
that
was
so
*NL*
obvious
,
while
it
was
so
simple
,
the
party
resumed
its
course
,
after
*NL*
making
a
short
halt
,
to
take
a
hurried
repast
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
meal
was
ended
,
the
scout
cast
a
glance
upward
at
the
setting
*NL*
sun
,
and
pushed
forward
with
a
rapidity
which
compelled
Heyward
and
the
*NL*
still
vigorous
Munro
to
exert
all
their
muscles
to
equal
.
Their
route
*NL*
now
lay
along
the
bottom
which
has
already
been
mentioned
.
As
the
Hurons
*NL*
had
made
no
further
efforts
to
conceal
their
footsteps
,
the
progress
of
*NL*
the
pursuers
was
no
longer
delayed
by
uncertainty
.
Before
an
hour
had
*NL*
elapsed
,
however
,
the
speed
of
Hawkeye
sensibly
abated
,
and
his
head
,
*NL*
instead
of
maintaining
its
former
direct
and
forward
look
,
began
to
turn
*NL*
suspiciously
from
side
to
side
,
as
if
he
were
conscious
of
approaching
*NL*
danger
.
He
soon
stopped
again
,
and
waited
for
the
whole
party
to
come
*NL*
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
scent
the
Hurons
,
''
he
said
,
speaking
to
the
Mohicans
;
``
yonder
is
open
*NL*
sky
,
through
the
treetops
,
and
we
are
getting
too
nigh
their
encampment
.
*NL*
Sagamore
,
you
will
take
the
hillside
,
to
the
right
;
Uncas
will
bend
*NL*
along
the
brook
to
the
left
,
while
I
will
try
the
trail
.
If
anything
*NL*
should
happen
,
the
call
will
be
three
croaks
of
a
crow
.
I
saw
one
of
the
*NL*
birds
fanning
himself
in
the
air
,
just
beyond
the
dead
oak
--
another
sign
*NL*
that
we
are
approaching
an
encampment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Indians
departed
their
several
ways
without
reply
,
while
Hawkeye
*NL*
cautiously
proceeded
with
the
two
gentlemen
.
Heyward
soon
pressed
to
the
*NL*
side
of
their
guide
,
eager
to
catch
an
early
glimpse
of
those
enemies
*NL*
he
had
pursued
with
so
much
toil
and
anxiety
.
His
companion
told
him
*NL*
to
steal
to
the
edge
of
the
wood
,
which
,
as
usual
,
was
fringed
with
*NL*
a
thicket
,
and
wait
his
coming
,
for
he
wished
to
examine
certain
*NL*
suspicious
signs
a
little
on
one
side
.
Duncan
obeyed
,
and
soon
found
*NL*
himself
in
a
situation
to
command
a
view
which
he
found
as
extraordinary
*NL*
as
it
was
novel
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
trees
of
many
acres
had
been
felled
,
and
the
glow
of
a
mild
summer
's
*NL*
evening
had
fallen
on
the
clearing
,
in
beautiful
contrast
to
the
gray
*NL*
light
of
the
forest
.
A
short
distance
from
the
place
where
Duncan
stood
,
*NL*
the
stream
had
seemingly
expanded
into
a
little
lake
,
covering
most
of
*NL*
the
low
land
,
from
mountain
to
mountain
.
The
water
fell
out
of
this
wide
*NL*
basin
,
in
a
cataract
so
regular
and
gentle
,
that
it
appeared
rather
to
*NL*
be
the
work
of
human
hands
than
fashioned
by
nature
.
A
hundred
earthen
*NL*
dwellings
stood
on
the
margin
of
the
lake
,
and
even
in
its
waters
,
as
*NL*
though
the
latter
had
overflowed
its
usual
banks
.
Their
rounded
roofs
,
*NL*
admirably
molded
for
defense
against
the
weather
,
denoted
more
of
*NL*
industry
and
foresight
than
the
natives
were
wont
to
bestow
on
their
*NL*
regular
habitations
,
much
less
on
those
they
occupied
for
the
temporary
*NL*
purposes
of
hunting
and
war
.
In
short
,
the
whole
village
or
town
,
*NL*
whichever
it
might
be
termed
,
possessed
more
of
method
and
neatness
of
*NL*
execution
,
than
the
white
men
had
been
accustomed
to
believe
belonged
,
*NL*
ordinarily
,
to
the
Indian
habits
.
It
appeared
,
however
,
to
be
deserted
.
*NL*
At
least
,
so
thought
Duncan
for
many
minutes
;
but
,
at
length
,
he
fancied
*NL*
he
discovered
several
human
forms
advancing
toward
him
on
all
fours
,
*NL*
and
apparently
dragging
in
the
train
some
heavy
,
and
as
he
was
quick
to
*NL*
apprehend
,
some
formidable
engine
.
Just
then
a
few
dark-looking
heads
*NL*
gleamed
out
of
the
dwellings
,
and
the
place
seemed
suddenly
alive
with
*NL*
beings
,
which
,
however
,
glided
from
cover
to
cover
so
swiftly
,
as
to
*NL*
allow
no
opportunity
of
examining
their
humors
or
pursuits
.
Alarmed
at
*NL*
these
suspicious
and
inexplicable
movements
,
he
was
about
to
attempt
the
*NL*
signal
of
the
crows
,
when
the
rustling
of
leaves
at
hand
drew
his
eyes
*NL*
in
another
direction
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
started
,
and
recoiled
a
few
paces
instinctively
,
when
he
*NL*
found
himself
within
a
hundred
yards
of
a
stranger
Indian
.
Recovering
*NL*
his
recollection
on
the
instant
,
instead
of
sounding
an
alarm
,
which
*NL*
might
prove
fatal
to
himself
,
he
remained
stationary
,
an
attentive
*NL*
observer
of
the
other
's
motions
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
instant
of
calm
observation
served
to
assure
Duncan
that
he
was
*NL*
undiscovered
.
The
native
,
like
himself
,
seemed
occupied
in
considering
*NL*
the
low
dwellings
of
the
village
,
and
the
stolen
movements
of
its
*NL*
inhabitants
.
It
was
impossible
to
discover
the
expression
of
his
*NL*
features
through
the
grotesque
mask
of
paint
under
which
they
were
*NL*
concealed
,
though
Duncan
fancied
it
was
rather
melancholy
than
savage
.
*NL*
His
head
was
shaved
,
as
usual
,
with
the
exception
of
the
crown
,
from
*NL*
whose
tuft
three
or
four
faded
feathers
from
a
hawk
's
wing
were
loosely
*NL*
dangling
.
A
ragged
calico
mantle
half
encircled
his
body
,
while
his
*NL*
nether
garment
was
composed
of
an
ordinary
shirt
,
the
sleeves
of
which
*NL*
were
made
to
perform
the
office
that
is
usually
executed
by
a
much
more
*NL*
commodious
arrangement
.
His
legs
were
,
however
,
covered
with
a
pair
of
*NL*
good
deer-skin
moccasins
.
Altogether
,
the
appearance
of
the
individual
*NL*
was
forlorn
and
miserable
.
*NL*
*NL*
Duncan
was
still
curiously
observing
the
person
of
his
neighbor
when
the
*NL*
scout
stole
silently
and
cautiously
to
his
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
we
have
reached
their
settlement
or
encampment
,
''
whispered
*NL*
the
young
man
;
``
and
here
is
one
of
the
savages
himself
,
in
a
very
*NL*
embarrassing
position
for
our
further
movements
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hawkeye
started
,
and
dropped
his
rifle
,
when
,
directed
by
the
finger
*NL*
of
his
companion
,
the
stranger
came
under
his
view
.
Then
lowering
the
*NL*
dangerous
muzzle
he
stretched
forward
his
long
neck
,
as
if
to
assist
a
*NL*
scrutiny
that
was
already
intensely
keen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
imp
is
not
a
Huron
,
''
he
said
,
``
nor
of
any
of
the
Canada
tribes
;
and
*NL*
yet
you
see
,
by
his
clothes
,
the
knave
has
been
plundering
a
white
.
Ay
,
*NL*
Montcalm
has
raked
the
woods
for
his
inroad
,
and
a
whooping
,
murdering
*NL*
set
of
varlets
has
he
gathered
together
.
Can
you
see
where
he
has
put
*NL*
his
rifle
or
his
bow
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
appears
to
have
no
arms
;
nor
does
he
seem
to
be
viciously
inclined
.
*NL*
Unless
he
communicate
the
alarm
to
his
fellows
,
who
,
as
you
see
,
are
*NL*
dodging
about
the
water
,
we
have
but
little
to
fear
from
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
scout
turned
to
Heyward
,
and
regarded
him
a
moment
with
unconcealed
*NL*
amazement
.
Then
opening
wide
his
mouth
,
he
indulged
in
unrestrained
*NL*
and
heartfelt
laughter
,
though
in
that
silent
and
peculiar
manner
which
*NL*
danger
had
so
long
taught
him
to
practise
.
*NL*
*NL*
Repeating
the
words
,
``
Fellows
who
are
dodging
about
the
water
!
''
he
*NL*
added
,
``
so
much
for
schooling
and
passing
a
boyhood
in
the
settlements
!
*NL*
The
knave
has
long
legs
,
though
,
and
shall
not
be
trusted
.
Do
you
keep
*NL*
him
under
your
rifle
while
I
creep
in
behind
,
through
the
bush
,
and
take
*NL*
him
alive
.
Fire
on
no
account
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Heyward
had
already
permitted
his
companion
to
bury
part
of
his
person
*NL*
in
the
thicket
,
when
,
stretching
forth
his
arm
,
he
arrested
him
,
in
*NL*
order
to
ask
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
see
you
in
danger
,
may
I
not
risk
a
shot
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hawkeye
regarded
him
a
moment
,
like
one
who
knew
not
how
to
take
the
*NL*
question
;
then
,
nodding
his
head
,
he
answered
,
still
laughing
,
though
*NL*
inaudibly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fire
a
whole
platoon
,
major
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
next
moment
he
was
concealed
by
the
leaves
.
Duncan
waited
several
*NL*
minutes
in
feverish
impatience
,
before
he
caught
another
glimpse
of
*NL*
the
scout
.
Then
he
reappeared
,
creeping
along
the
earth
,
from
which
his
*NL*
dress
was
hardly
distinguishable
,
directly
in
the
rear
of
his
intended
*NL*
captive
.
Having
reached
within
a
few
yards
of
the
latter
,
he
arose
to
*NL*
his
feet
,
silently
and
slowly
.
At
that
instant
,
several
loud
blows
were
*NL*
struck
on
the
water
,
and
Duncan
turned
his
eyes
just
in
time
to
perceive
*NL*
that
a
hundred
dark
forms
were
plunging
,
in
a
body
,
into
the
troubled
*NL*
little
sheet
.
Grasping
his
rifle
his
looks
were
again
bent
on
the
Indian
*NL*
near
him
.
Instead
of
taking
the
alarm
,
the
unconscious
savage
stretched
*NL*
forward
his
neck
,
as
if
he
also
watched
the
movements
about
the
gloomy
*NL*
lake
,
with
a
sort
of
silly
curiosity
.
In
the
meantime
,
the
uplifted
*NL*
hand
of
Hawkeye
was
above
him
.
But
,
without
any
apparent
reason
,
it
was
*NL*
withdrawn
,
and
its
owner
indulged
in
another
long
,
though
still
silent
,
*NL*
fit
of
merriment
.
When
the
peculiar
and
hearty
laughter
of
Hawkeye
*NL*
was
ended
,
instead
of
grasping
his
victim
by
the
throat
,
he
tapped
him
*NL*
lightly
on
the
shoulder
,
and
exclaimed
aloud
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
now
,
friend
!
have
you
a
mind
to
teach
the
beavers
to
sing
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Even
so
,
''
was
the
ready
answer
.
``
It
would
seem
that
the
Being
that
gave
*NL*
them
power
to
improve
His
gifts
so
well
,
would
not
deny
them
voices
to
*NL*
proclaim
His
praise
.

Midsummer
Night
's
Dream
*NL*
*NL*
The
reader
may
better
imagine
,
than
we
describe
the
surprise
of
Heyward
.
*NL*
His
lurking
Indians
were
suddenly
converted
into
four-footed
beasts
;
his
*NL*
lake
into
a
beaver
pond
;
his
cataract
into
a
dam
,
constructed
by
those
*NL*
industrious
and
ingenious
quadrupeds
;
and
a
suspected
enemy
into
his
*NL*
tried
friend
,
David
Gamut
,
the
master
of
psalmody
.
The
presence
of
the
*NL*
latter
created
so
many
unexpected
hopes
relative
to
the
sisters
that
,
*NL*
without
a
moment
's
hesitation
,
the
young
man
broke
out
of
his
ambush
,
*NL*
and
sprang
forward
to
join
the
two
principal
actors
in
the
scene
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
merriment
of
Hawkeye
was
not
easily
appeased
.
Without
ceremony
,
and
*NL*
with
a
rough
hand
,
he
twirled
the
supple
Gamut
around
on
his
heel
,
and
*NL*
more
than
once
affirmed
that
the
Hurons
had
done
themselves
great
credit
*NL*
in
the
fashion
of
his
costume
.
Then
,
seizing
the
hand
of
the
other
,
he
*NL*
squeezed
it
with
a
grip
that
brought
tears
into
the
eyes
of
the
placid
*NL*
David
,
and
wished
him
joy
of
his
new
condition
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
were
about
opening
your
throat-practisings
among
the
beavers
,
were
*NL*
ye
?
''
he
said
.
``
The
cunning
devils
know
half
the
trade
already
,
for
they
*NL*
beat
the
time
with
their
tails
,
as
you
heard
just
now
;
and
in
good
time
*NL*
it
was
,
too
,
or
`
killdeer
'
might
have
sounded
the
first
note
among
*NL*
them
.
I
have
known
greater
fools
,
who
could
read
and
write
,
than
an
*NL*
experienced
old
beaver
;
but
as
for
squalling
,
the
animals
are
born
dumb
!
*NL*
What
think
you
of
such
a
song
as
this
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
David
shut
his
sensitive
ears
,
and
even
Heyward
apprised
as
he
was
of
*NL*
the
nature
of
the
cry
,
looked
upward
in
quest
of
the
bird
,
as
the
cawing
*NL*
of
a
crow
rang
in
the
air
about
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
See
!
''
continued
the
laughing
scout
,
as
he
pointed
toward
the
remainder
*NL*
of
the
party
,
who
,
in
obedience
to
the
signal
,
were
already
approaching
;
*NL*
``
this
is
music
which
has
its
natural
virtues
;
it
brings
two
good
rifles
*NL*
to
my
elbow
,
to
say
nothing
of
the
knives
and
tomahawks
.
But
we
see
that
*NL*
you
are
safe
;
now
tell
us
what
has
become
of
the
maidens
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
captives
to
the
heathen
,
''
said
David
;
``
and
,
though
greatly
*NL*
troubled
in
spirit
,
enjoying
comfort
and
safety
in
the
body
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Both
!
''
demanded
the
breathless
Heyward
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Even
so
.
Though
our
wayfaring
has
been
sore
and
our
sustenance
scanty
,
*NL*
we
have
had
little
other
cause
for
complaint
,
except
the
violence
done
*NL*
our
feelings
,
by
being
thus
led
in
captivity
into
a
far
land
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bless
ye
for
these
very
words
!
''
exclaimed
the
trembling
Munro
;
``
I
shall
*NL*
then
receive
my
babes
,
spotless
and
angel-like
,
as
I
lost
them
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
not
that
their
delivery
is
at
hand
,
''
returned
the
doubting
*NL*
David
;
``
the
leader
of
these
savages
is
possessed
of
an
evil
spirit
that
*NL*
no
power
short
of
Omnipotence
can
tame
.
I
have
tried
him
sleeping
and
*NL*
waking
,
but
neither
sounds
nor
language
seem
to
touch
his
soul
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
is
the
knave
?
''
bluntly
interrupted
the
scout
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
hunts
the
moose
to-day
,
with
his
young
men
;
and
tomorrow
,
as
I
hear
,
*NL*
they
pass
further
into
the
forests
,
and
nigher
to
the
borders
of
Canada
.
*NL*
The
elder
maiden
is
conveyed
to
a
neighboring
people
,
whose
lodges
*NL*
are
situate
beyond
yonder
black
pinnacle
of
rock
;
while
the
younger
*NL*
is
detained
among
the
women
of
the
Hurons
,
whose
dwellings
are
but
two
*NL*
short
miles
hence
,
on
a
table-land
,
where
the
fire
had
done
the
office
*NL*
of
the
axe
,
and
prepared
the
place
for
their
reception
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alice
,
my
gentle
Alice
!
''
murmured
Heyward
;
``
she
has
lost
the
*NL*
consolation
of
her
sister
's
presence
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Even
so
.
But
so
far
as
praise
and
thanksgiving
in
psalmody
can
temper
*NL*
the
spirit
in
affliction
,
she
has
not
suffered
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
she
then
a
heart
for
music
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
the
graver
and
more
solemn
character
;
though
it
must
be
acknowledged
*NL*
that
,
in
spite
of
all
my
endeavors
,
the
maiden
weeps
oftener
than
she
*NL*
smiles
.
At
such
moments
I
forbear
to
press
the
holy
songs
;
but
there
are
*NL*
many
sweet
and
comfortable
periods
of
satisfactory
communication
,
*NL*
when
the
ears
of
the
savages
are
astounded
with
the
upliftings
of
our
*NL*
voices
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
why
are
you
permitted
to
go
at
large
,
unwatched
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
David
composed
his
features
into
what
he
intended
should
express
an
air
*NL*
of
modest
humility
,
before
he
meekly
replied
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Little
be
the
praise
to
such
a
worm
as
I.
But
,
though
the
power
of
*NL*
psalmody
was
suspended
in
the
terrible
business
of
that
field
of
blood
*NL*
through
which
we
have
passed
,
it
has
recovered
its
influence
even
over
*NL*
the
souls
of
the
heathen
,
and
I
am
suffered
to
go
and
come
at
will
.

The
scout
laughed
,
and
,
tapping
his
own
forehead
significantly
,
he
*NL*
perhaps
explained
the
singular
indulgence
more
satisfactorily
when
he
*NL*
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Indians
never
harm
a
non-composser
.
But
why
,
when
the
path
lay
open
*NL*
before
your
eyes
,
did
you
not
strike
back
on
your
own
trail
-LRB-
it
is
not
*NL*
so
blind
as
that
which
a
squirrel
would
make
-RRB-
,
and
bring
in
the
tidings
*NL*
to
Edward
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
scout
,
remembering
only
his
own
sturdy
and
iron
nature
,
had
probably
*NL*
exacted
a
task
that
David
,
under
no
circumstances
,
could
have
performed
.
*NL*
But
,
without
entirely
losing
the
meekness
of
his
air
,
the
latter
was
*NL*
content
to
answer
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Though
my
soul
would
rejoice
to
visit
the
habitations
of
Christendom
*NL*
once
more
,
my
feet
would
rather
follow
the
tender
spirits
intrusted
to
*NL*
my
keeping
,
even
into
the
idolatrous
province
of
the
Jesuits
,
than
take
*NL*
one
step
backward
,
while
they
pined
in
captivity
and
sorrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Though
the
figurative
language
of
David
was
not
very
intelligible
,
the
*NL*
sincere
and
steady
expression
of
his
eye
,
and
the
glow
of
his
honest
*NL*
countenance
,
were
not
easily
mistaken
.
Uncas
pressed
closer
to
his
side
,
*NL*
and
regarded
the
speaker
with
a
look
of
commendation
,
while
his
*NL*
father
expressed
his
satisfaction
by
the
ordinary
pithy
exclamation
of
*NL*
approbation
.
The
scout
shook
his
head
as
he
rejoined
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Lord
never
intended
that
the
man
should
place
all
his
endeavors
in
*NL*
his
throat
,
to
the
neglect
of
other
and
better
gifts
!
But
he
has
fallen
*NL*
into
the
hands
of
some
silly
woman
,
when
he
should
have
been
gathering
*NL*
his
education
under
a
blue
sky
,
among
the
beauties
of
the
forest
.
Here
,
*NL*
friend
;
I
did
intend
to
kindle
a
fire
with
this
tooting-whistle
of
*NL*
thine
;
but
,
as
you
value
the
thing
,
take
it
,
and
blow
your
best
on
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gamut
received
his
pitch-pipe
with
as
strong
an
expression
of
pleasure
*NL*
as
he
believed
compatible
with
the
grave
functions
he
exercised
.
After
*NL*
essaying
its
virtues
repeatedly
,
in
contrast
with
his
own
voice
,
and
,
*NL*
satisfying
himself
that
none
of
its
melody
was
lost
,
he
made
a
very
*NL*
serious
demonstration
toward
achieving
a
few
stanzas
of
one
of
the
*NL*
longest
effusions
in
the
little
volume
so
often
mentioned
.
*NL*
*NL*
Heyward
,
however
,
hastily
interrupted
his
pious
purpose
by
continuing
*NL*
questions
concerning
the
past
and
present
condition
of
his
fellow
*NL*
captives
,
and
in
a
manner
more
methodical
than
had
been
permitted
by
his
*NL*
feelings
in
the
opening
of
their
interview
.
David
,
though
he
regarded
*NL*
his
treasure
with
longing
eyes
,
was
constrained
to
answer
,
especially
*NL*
as
the
venerable
father
took
a
part
in
the
interrogatories
,
with
an
*NL*
interest
too
imposing
to
be
denied
.
Nor
did
the
scout
fail
to
throw
in
*NL*
a
pertinent
inquiry
,
whenever
a
fitting
occasion
presented
.
In
this
*NL*
manner
,
though
with
frequent
interruptions
which
were
filled
with
*NL*
certain
threatening
sounds
from
the
recovered
instrument
,
the
pursuers
*NL*
were
put
in
possession
of
such
leading
circumstances
as
were
likely
to
*NL*
prove
useful
in
accomplishing
their
great
and
engrossing
object
--
the
*NL*
recovery
of
the
sisters
.
The
narrative
of
David
was
simple
,
and
the
*NL*
facts
but
few
.
*NL*
*NL*
Magua
had
waited
on
the
mountain
until
a
safe
moment
to
retire
presented
*NL*
itself
,
when
he
had
descended
,
and
taken
the
route
along
the
western
*NL*
side
of
the
Horican
in
direction
of
the
Canadas
.
As
the
subtle
Huron
was
*NL*
familiar
with
the
paths
,
and
well
knew
there
was
no
immediate
danger
of
*NL*
pursuit
,
their
progress
had
been
moderate
,
and
far
from
fatiguing
.
*NL*
It
appeared
from
the
unembellished
statement
of
David
,
that
his
own
*NL*
presence
had
been
rather
endured
than
desired
;
though
even
Magua
had
not
*NL*
been
entirely
exempt
from
that
veneration
with
which
the
Indians
regard
*NL*
those
whom
the
Great
Spirit
had
visited
in
their
intellects
.
At
night
,
*NL*
the
utmost
care
had
been
taken
of
the
captives
,
both
to
prevent
injury
*NL*
from
the
damps
of
the
woods
and
to
guard
against
an
escape
.
At
*NL*
the
spring
,
the
horses
were
turned
loose
,
as
has
been
seen
;
and
,
*NL*
notwithstanding
the
remoteness
and
length
of
their
trail
,
the
artifices
*NL*
already
named
were
resorted
to
,
in
order
to
cut
off
every
clue
to
their
*NL*
place
of
retreat
.
On
their
arrival
at
the
encampment
of
his
people
,
*NL*
Magua
,
in
obedience
to
a
policy
seldom
departed
from
,
separated
his
*NL*
prisoners
.
Cora
had
been
sent
to
a
tribe
that
temporarily
occupied
an
*NL*
adjacent
valley
,
though
David
was
far
too
ignorant
of
the
customs
and
*NL*
history
of
the
natives
,
to
be
able
to
declare
anything
satisfactory
*NL*
concerning
their
name
or
character
.
He
only
knew
that
they
had
not
*NL*
engaged
in
the
late
expedition
against
William
Henry
;
that
,
like
the
*NL*
Hurons
themselves
they
were
allies
of
Montcalm
;
and
that
they
maintained
*NL*
an
amicable
,
though
a
watchful
intercourse
with
the
warlike
and
*NL*
savage
people
whom
chance
had
,
for
a
time
,
brought
in
such
close
and
*NL*
disagreeable
contact
with
themselves
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Mohicans
and
the
scout
listened
to
his
interrupted
and
imperfect
*NL*
narrative
,
with
an
interest
that
obviously
increased
as
he
proceeded
;
*NL*
and
it
was
while
attempting
to
explain
the
pursuits
of
the
community
in
*NL*
which
Cora
was
detained
,
that
the
latter
abruptly
demanded
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
see
the
fashion
of
their
knives
?
were
they
of
English
or
French
*NL*
formation
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
thoughts
were
bent
on
no
such
vanities
,
but
rather
mingled
in
*NL*
consolation
with
those
of
the
maidens
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
time
may
come
when
you
will
not
consider
the
knife
of
a
savage
such
*NL*
a
despicable
vanity
,
''
returned
the
scout
,
with
a
strong
expression
of
*NL*
contempt
for
the
other
's
dullness
.
``
Had
they
held
their
corn
feast
--
or
*NL*
can
you
say
anything
of
the
totems
of
the
tribe
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
corn
,
we
had
many
and
plentiful
feasts
;
for
the
grain
,
being
in
*NL*
the
milk
is
both
sweet
to
the
mouth
and
comfortable
to
the
stomach
.
Of
*NL*
totem
,
I
know
not
the
meaning
;
but
if
it
appertaineth
in
any
wise
to
the
*NL*
art
of
Indian
music
,
it
need
not
be
inquired
after
at
their
hands
.
They
*NL*
never
join
their
voices
in
praise
,
and
it
would
seem
that
they
are
among
*NL*
the
profanest
of
the
idolatrous
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Therein
you
belie
the
natur
'
of
an
Indian
.
Even
the
Mingo
adores
but
*NL*
the
true
and
loving
God
.
'T
is
wicked
fabrication
of
the
whites
,
and
I
*NL*
say
it
to
the
shame
of
my
color
that
would
make
the
warrior
bow
down
*NL*
before
images
of
his
own
creation
.
It
is
true
,
they
endeavor
to
make
*NL*
truces
to
the
wicked
one
--
as
who
would
not
with
an
enemy
he
can
not
*NL*
conquer
!
but
they
look
up
for
favor
and
assistance
to
the
Great
and
Good
*NL*
Spirit
only
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
may
be
so
,
''
said
David
;
``
but
I
have
seen
strange
and
fantastic
*NL*
images
drawn
in
their
paint
,
of
which
their
admiration
and
care
savored
*NL*
of
spiritual
pride
;
especially
one
,
and
that
,
too
,
a
foul
and
loathsome
*NL*
object
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
it
a
sarpent
?
''
quickly
demanded
the
scout
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Much
the
same
.
It
was
in
the
likeness
of
an
abject
and
creeping
*NL*
tortoise
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hugh
!
''
exclaimed
both
the
attentive
Mohicans
in
a
breath
;
while
the
*NL*
scout
shook
his
head
with
the
air
of
one
who
had
made
an
important
but
*NL*
by
no
means
a
pleasing
discovery
.
Then
the
father
spoke
,
in
the
language
*NL*
of
the
Delawares
,
and
with
a
calmness
and
dignity
that
instantly
*NL*
arrested
the
attention
even
of
those
to
whom
his
words
were
*NL*
unintelligible
.
His
gestures
were
impressive
,
and
at
times
energetic
.
*NL*
Once
he
lifted
his
arm
on
high
;
and
,
as
it
descended
,
the
action
threw
*NL*
aside
the
folds
of
his
light
mantle
,
a
finger
resting
on
his
breast
,
as
*NL*
if
he
would
enforce
his
meaning
by
the
attitude
.
Duncan
's
eyes
followed
*NL*
the
movement
,
and
he
perceived
that
the
animal
just
mentioned
was
*NL*
beautifully
,
though
faintly
,
worked
in
blue
tint
,
on
the
swarthy
breast
*NL*
of
the
chief
.
All
that
he
had
ever
heard
of
the
violent
separation
of
*NL*
the
vast
tribes
of
the
Delawares
rushed
across
his
mind
,
and
he
awaited
*NL*
the
proper
moment
to
speak
,
with
a
suspense
that
was
rendered
nearly
*NL*
intolerable
by
his
interest
in
the
stake
.
His
wish
,
however
,
was
*NL*
anticipated
by
the
scout
who
turned
from
his
red
friend
,
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
found
that
which
may
be
good
or
evil
to
us
,
as
heaven
disposes
.
*NL*
The
Sagamore
is
of
the
high
blood
of
the
Delawares
,
and
is
the
great
*NL*
chief
of
their
Tortoises
!
That
some
of
this
stock
are
among
the
people
*NL*
of
whom
the
singer
tells
us
,
is
plain
by
his
words
;
and
,
had
he
but
*NL*
spent
half
the
breath
in
prudent
questions
that
he
has
blown
away
in
*NL*
making
a
trumpet
of
his
throat
,
we
might
have
known
how
many
warriors
*NL*
they
numbered
.
It
is
,
altogether
,
a
dangerous
path
we
move
in
;
for
a
*NL*
friend
whose
face
is
turned
from
you
often
bears
a
bloodier
mind
than
*NL*
the
enemy
who
seeks
your
scalp
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Explain
,
''
said
Duncan
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
a
long
and
melancholy
tradition
,
and
one
I
little
like
to
think
*NL*
of
;
for
it
is
not
to
be
denied
that
the
evil
has
been
mainly
done
by
men
*NL*
with
white
skins
.
But
it
has
ended
in
turning
the
tomahawk
of
brother
*NL*
against
brother
,
and
brought
the
Mingo
and
the
Delaware
to
travel
in
the
*NL*
same
path
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
,
then
,
suspect
it
is
a
portion
of
that
people
among
whom
Cora
*NL*
resides
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
scout
nodded
his
head
in
assent
,
though
he
seemed
anxious
to
waive
*NL*
the
further
discussion
of
a
subject
that
appeared
painful
.
The
impatient
*NL*
Duncan
now
made
several
hasty
and
desperate
propositions
to
attempt
*NL*
the
release
of
the
sisters
.
Munro
seemed
to
shake
off
his
apathy
,
and
*NL*
listened
to
the
wild
schemes
of
the
young
man
with
a
deference
that
his
*NL*
gray
hairs
and
reverend
years
should
have
denied
.
But
the
scout
,
after
*NL*
suffering
the
ardor
of
the
lover
to
expend
itself
a
little
,
found
means
*NL*
to
convince
him
of
the
folly
of
precipitation
,
in
a
manner
that
would
*NL*
require
their
coolest
judgment
and
utmost
fortitude
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
be
well
,
''
he
added
,
``
to
let
this
man
go
in
again
,
as
usual
,
*NL*
and
for
him
to
tarry
in
the
lodges
,
giving
notice
to
the
gentle
ones
of
*NL*
our
approach
,
until
we
call
him
out
,
by
signal
,
to
consult
.
You
know
the
*NL*
cry
of
a
crow
,
friend
,
from
the
whistle
of
the
whip-poor-will
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
a
pleasing
bird
,
''
returned
David
,
``
and
has
a
soft
and
melancholy
*NL*
note
!
though
the
time
is
rather
quick
and
ill-measured
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
He
speaks
of
the
wish-ton-wish

said
the
scout
;
``
well

whip-poor-will

call
three
times
repeated
,
you
are
to
come
into
the

bushes

bird
might
be
supposed

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stop
,
''
interrupted
Heyward
;
``
I
will
accompany
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You

exclaimed
the
astonished
Hawkeye
;
``

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
Hawkeye
regarded
the
young
man
a
moment
in
speechless
amazement
.
*NL*
But
Duncan
,
who
,
in
deference
to
the
other
's
skill
and
services
,
had
*NL*
hitherto
submitted
somewhat
implicitly
to
his
dictation
,
now
assumed
the
*NL*
superior
,
with
a
manner
that
was
not
easily
resisted
.
He
waved
his
hand
,
*NL*
in
sign
of
his
dislike
to
all
remonstrance
,
and
then
,
in
more
tempered
*NL*
language
,
he
continued
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
the
means
of
disguise
;
change
me

you
will

in
short
,
alter
me
to
anything

a
fool

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
not
for
one

me
to
say
that
he

already
formed

powerful
a
hand
as
Providence
,
stands
in
need

a
change

muttered
the
*NL*
discontented
scout
.
``
When

*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen

interrupted
Duncan
;
``
you
have
heard
from
this
faithful
*NL*
follower
of
the
captives
,
that
the
Indians
are
of
two
tribes
,
if
not
*NL*
of
different
nations
.
With
one
,
whom
you
think
to
be
a
branch
of
the
*NL*
Delawares
,
is
she
you
call
the
`
dark-hair
'
;
the
other
,
and
younger
,
*NL*
of
the
ladies
,
is
undeniably
with
our
declared
enemies
,
the
Hurons
.
It
*NL*
becomes
my
youth
and
rank
to
attempt
the
latter
adventure
.
While
you
,
*NL*
therefore
,
are
negotiating
with
your
friends
for
the
release
of
one
of
*NL*
the
sisters
,
I
will
effect
that
of
the
other
,
or
die
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
awakened
spirit
of
the
young
soldier
gleamed
in
his
eyes
,
and
his
*NL*
form
became
imposing
under
its
influence
.
Hawkeye
,
though
too
much
*NL*
accustomed
to
Indian
artifices
not
to
foresee
the
danger
of
the
*NL*
experiment
,
knew
not
well
how
to
combat
this
sudden
resolution
.
*NL*
*NL*
Perhaps
there
was
something
in
the
proposal
that
suited
his
own
hardy
*NL*
nature
,
and
that
secret
love
of
desperate
adventure
,
which
had
increased
*NL*
with
his
experience
,
until
hazard
and
danger
had
become
,
in
some
*NL*
measure
,
necessary
to
the
enjoyment
of
his
existence
.
Instead
of
*NL*
continuing
to
oppose
the
scheme
of
Duncan
,
his
humor
suddenly
altered
,
*NL*
and
he
lent
himself
to
its
execution
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
''
he
said
,
with
a
good-humored
smile
;
``
the
buck
that
will
take
*NL*
to
the
water
must
be
headed
,
and
not
followed
.
Chingachgook
has
as
many
*NL*
different
paints
as
the
engineer
officer
's
wife
,
who
takes
down
natur
'
*NL*
on
scraps
of
paper
,
making
the
mountains
look
like
cocks
of
rusty
hay
,
*NL*
and
placing
the
blue
sky
in
reach
of
your
hand
.
The
Sagamore
can
use
*NL*
them
,
too
.
Seat
yourself
on
the
log
;
and
my
life
on
it
,
he
can
soon
make
*NL*
a
natural
fool
of
you
,
and
that
well
to
your
liking
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Duncan
complied
;
and
the
Mohican
,
who
had
been
an
attentive
listener
to
*NL*
the
discourse
,
readily
undertook
the
office
.
Long
practised
in
all
the
*NL*
subtle
arts
of
his
race
,
he
drew
,
with
great
dexterity
and
quickness
,
*NL*
the
fantastic
shadow
that
the
natives
were
accustomed
to
consider
as
the
*NL*
evidence
of
a
friendly
and
jocular
disposition
.
Every
line
that
could
*NL*
possibly
be
interpreted
into
a
secret
inclination
for
war
,
was
carefully
*NL*
avoided
;
while
,
on
the
other
hand
,
he
studied
those
conceits
that
might
*NL*
be
construed
into
amity
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
short
,
he
entirely
sacrificed
every
appearance
of
the
warrior
to
the
*NL*
masquerade
of
a
buffoon
.
Such
exhibitions
were
not
uncommon
among
the
*NL*
Indians
,
and
as
Duncan
was
already
sufficiently
disguised
in
his
dress
,
*NL*
there
certainly
did
exist
some
reason
for
believing
that
,
with
his
*NL*
knowledge
of
French
,
he
might
pass
for
a
juggler
from
Ticonderoga
,
*NL*
straggling
among
the
allied
and
friendly
tribes
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
was
thought
to
be
sufficiently
painted
,
the
scout
gave
him
much
*NL*
friendly
advice
;
concerted
signals
,
and
appointed
the
place
where
they
*NL*
should
meet
,
in
the
event
of
mutual
success
.
The
parting
between
Munro
*NL*
and
his
young
friend
was
more
melancholy
;
still
,
the
former
submitted
*NL*
to
the
separation
with
an
indifference
that
his
warm
and
honest
nature
*NL*
would
never
have
permitted
in
a
more
healthful
state
of
mind
.
The
scout
*NL*
led
Heyward
aside
,
and
acquainted
him
with
his
intention
to
leave
the
*NL*
veteran
in
some
safe
encampment
,
in
charge
of
Chingachgook
,
while
he
and
*NL*
Uncas
pursued
their
inquires
among
the
people
they
had
reason
to
believe
*NL*
were
Delawares
.
Then
,
renewing
his
cautions
and
advice
,
he
concluded
by
*NL*
saying
,
with
a
solemnity
and
warmth
of
feeling
,
with
which
Duncan
was
*NL*
deeply
touched
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
,
now
,
God
bless
you
!
You
have
shown
a
spirit
that
I
like
;
for
it
is
*NL*
the
gift
of
youth
,
more
especially
one
of
warm
blood
and
a
stout
heart
.
*NL*
But
believe
the
warning
of
a
man
who
has
reason
to
know
all
he
says
to
*NL*
be
true
.
You
will
have
occasion
for
your
best
manhood
,
and
for
a
sharper
*NL*
wit
than
what
is
to
be
gathered
in
books
,
afore
you
outdo
the
cunning
or
*NL*
get
the
better
of
the
courage
of
a
Mingo
.
God
bless
you
!
if
the
Hurons
*NL*
master
your
scalp
,
rely
on
the
promise
of
one
who
has
two
stout
warriors
*NL*
to
back
him
.
They
shall
pay
for
their
victory
,
with
a
life
for
every
*NL*
hair
it
holds
.
I
say
,
young
gentleman
,
may
Providence
bless
your
*NL*
undertaking
,
which
is
altogether
for
good
;
and
,
remember
,
that
to
outwit
*NL*
the
knaves
it
is
lawful
to
practise
things
that
may
not
be
naturally
the
*NL*
gift
of
a
white-skin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Duncan
shook
his
worthy
and
reluctant
associate
warmly
by
the
hand
,
once
*NL*
more
recommended
his
aged
friend
to
his
care
,
and
returning
his
good
*NL*
wishes
,
he
motioned
to
David
to
proceed
.
Hawkeye
gazed
after
the
*NL*
high-spirited
and
adventurous
young
man
for
several
moments
,
in
open
*NL*
admiration
;
then
,
shaking
his
head
doubtingly
,
he
turned
,
and
led
his
*NL*
own
division
of
the
party
into
the
concealment
of
the
forest
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
route
taken
by
Duncan
and
David
lay
directly
across
the
clearing
of
*NL*
the
beavers
,
and
along
the
margin
of
their
pond
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
former
found
himself
alone
with
one
so
simple
,
and
so
little
*NL*
qualified
to
render
any
assistance
in
desperate
emergencies
,
he
first
*NL*
began
to
be
sensible
of
the
difficulties
of
the
task
he
had
undertaken
.
*NL*
The
fading
light
increased
the
gloominess
of
the
bleak
and
savage
*NL*
wilderness
that
stretched
so
far
on
every
side
of
him
,
and
there
was
*NL*
even
a
fearful
character
in
the
stillness
of
those
little
huts
,
that
*NL*
he
knew
were
so
abundantly
peopled
.
It
struck
him
,
as
he
gazed
at
the
*NL*
admirable
structures
and
the
wonderful
precautions
of
their
sagacious
*NL*
inmates
,
that
even
the
brutes
of
these
vast
wilds
were
possessed
of
*NL*
an
instinct
nearly
commensurate
with
his
own
reason
;
and
he
could
not
*NL*
reflect
,
without
anxiety
,
on
the
unequal
contest
that
he
had
so
rashly
*NL*
courted
.
Then
came
the
glowing
image
of
Alice
;
her
distress
;
her
actual
*NL*
danger
;
and
all
the
peril
of
his
situation
was
forgotten
.
Cheering
*NL*
David
,
he
moved
on
with
the
light
and
vigorous
step
of
youth
and
*NL*
enterprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
making
nearly
a
semicircle
around
the
pond
,
they
diverged
from
the
*NL*
water-course
,
and
began
to
ascend
to
the
level
of
a
slight
elevation
in
*NL*
that
bottom
land
,
over
which
they
journeyed
.
Within
half
an
hour
they
*NL*
gained
the
margin
of
another
opening
that
bore
all
the
signs
of
having
*NL*
been
also
made
by
the
beavers
,
and
which
those
sagacious
animals
had
*NL*
probably
been
induced
,
by
some
accident
,
to
abandon
,
for
the
more
*NL*
eligible
position
they
now
occupied
.
A
very
natural
sensation
caused
*NL*
Duncan
to
hesitate
a
moment
,
unwilling
to
leave
the
cover
of
their
*NL*
bushy
path
,
as
a
man
pauses
to
collect
his
energies
before
he
essays
any
*NL*
hazardous
experiment
,
in
which
he
is
secretly
conscious
they
will
all
be
*NL*
needed
.
He
profited
by
the
halt
,
to
gather
such
information
as
might
be
*NL*
obtained
from
his
short
and
hasty
glances
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
opposite
side
of
the
clearing
,
and
near
the
point
where
the
brook
*NL*
tumbled
over
some
rocks
,
from
a
still
higher
level
,
some
fifty
or
sixty
*NL*
lodges
,
rudely
fabricated
of
logs
brush
,
and
earth
intermingled
,
were
*NL*
to
be
discovered
.
They
were
arranged
without
any
order
,
and
seemed
to
be
*NL*
constructed
with
very
little
attention
to
neatness
or
beauty
.
Indeed
,
*NL*
so
very
inferior
were
they
in
the
two
latter
particulars
to
the
village
*NL*
Duncan
had
just
seen
,
that
he
began
to
expect
a
second
surprise
,
no
*NL*
less
astonishing
that
the
former
.
This
expectation
was
in
no
degree
*NL*
diminished
,
when
,
by
the
doubtful
twilight
,
he
beheld
twenty
or
thirty
*NL*
forms
rising
alternately
from
the
cover
of
the
tall
,
coarse
grass
,
in
*NL*
front
of
the
lodges
,
and
then
sinking
again
from
the
sight
,
as
it
were
*NL*
to
burrow
in
the
earth
.
By
the
sudden
and
hasty
glimpses
that
he
caught
*NL*
of
these
figures
,
they
seemed
more
like
dark
,
glancing
specters
,
or
some
*NL*
other
unearthly
beings
,
than
creatures
fashioned
with
the
ordinary
and
*NL*
vulgar
materials
of
flesh
and
blood
.
A
gaunt
,
naked
form
was
seen
,
for
a
*NL*
single
instant
,
tossing
its
arms
wildly
in
the
air
,
and
then
the
spot
it
*NL*
had
filled
was
vacant
;
the
figure
appearing
suddenly
in
some
other
*NL*
and
distant
place
,
or
being
succeeded
by
another
,
possessing
the
same
*NL*
mysterious
character
.
David
,
observing
that
his
companion
lingered
,
*NL*
pursued
the
direction
of
his
gaze
,
and
in
some
measure
recalled
the
*NL*
recollection
of
Heyward
,
by
speaking
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
much
fruitful
soil
uncultivated
here
,
''
he
said
;
``
and
,
I
may
*NL*
add
,
without
the
sinful
leaven
of
self-commendation
,
that
,
since
my
*NL*
short
sojourn
in
these
heathenish
abodes
,
much
good
seed
has
been
*NL*
scattered
by
the
wayside
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
tribes
are
fonder
of
the
chase
than
of
the
arts
of
men
of
labor
,
''
*NL*
returned
the
unconscious
Duncan
,
still
gazing
at
the
objects
of
his
*NL*
wonder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
rather
joy
than
labor
to
the
spirit
,
to
lift
up
the
voice
in
*NL*
praise
;
but
sadly
do
these
boys
abuse
their
gifts
.
Rarely
have
I
found
*NL*
any
of
their
age
,
on
whom
nature
has
so
freely
bestowed
the
elements
*NL*
of
psalmody
;
and
surely
,
surely
,
there
are
none
who
neglect
them
more
.
*NL*
Three
nights
have
I
now
tarried
here
,
and
three
several
times
have
I
*NL*
assembled
the
urchins
to
join
in
sacred
song
;
and
as
often
have
they
*NL*
responded
to
my
efforts
with
whoopings
and
howlings
that
have
chilled
my
*NL*
soul
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
whom
speak
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
those
children
of
the
devil
,
who
waste
the
precious
moments
in
*NL*
yonder
idle
antics
.
Ah
!
the
wholesome
restraint
of
discipline
is
but
*NL*
little
known
among
this
self-abandoned
people
.
In
a
country
of
birches
,
*NL*
a
rod
is
never
seen
,
and
it
ought
not
to
appear
a
marvel
in
my
eyes
,
*NL*
that
the
choicest
blessings
of
Providence
are
wasted
in
such
cries
as
*NL*
these
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
David
closed
his
ears
against
the
juvenile
pack
,
whose
yell
just
then
*NL*
rang
shrilly
through
the
forest
;
and
Duncan
,
suffering
his
lip
to
curl
,
*NL*
as
in
mockery
of
his
own
superstition
,
said
firmly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
will
proceed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Without
removing
the
safeguards
form
his
ears
,
the
master
of
song
*NL*
complied
,
and
together
they
pursued
their
way
toward
what
David
was
*NL*
sometimes
wont
to
call
the
``
tents
of
the
Philistines

``

*NL*
--
Lady
of
the
Lake
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
unusual
to
find
an
encampment
of
the
natives
,
like
those
of
the
*NL*
more
instructed
whites
,
guarded
by
the
presence
of
armed
men
.
Well
*NL*
informed
of
the
approach
of
every
danger
,
while
it
is
yet
at
a
distance
,
*NL*
the
Indian
generally
rests
secure
under
his
knowledge
of
the
signs
of
*NL*
the
forest
,
and
the
long
and
difficult
paths
that
separate
him
from
*NL*
those
he
has
most
reason
to
dread
.
But
the
enemy
who
,
by
any
lucky
*NL*
concurrence
of
accidents
,
has
found
means
to
elude
the
vigilance
of
the
*NL*
scouts
,
will
seldom
meet
with
sentinels
nearer
home
to
sound
the
alarm
.
*NL*
In
addition
to
this
general
usage
,
the
tribes
friendly
to
the
French
*NL*
knew
too
well
the
weight
of
the
blow
that
had
just
been
struck
,
to
*NL*
apprehend
any
immediate
danger
from
the
hostile
nations
that
were
*NL*
tributary
to
the
crown
of
Britain
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Duncan
and
David
,
therefore
,
found
themselves
in
the
center
of
the
*NL*
children
,
who
played
the
antics
already
mentioned
,
it
was
without
the
*NL*
least
previous
intimation
of
their
approach
.
But
so
soon
as
they
were
*NL*
observed
the
whole
of
the
juvenile
pack
raised
,
by
common
consent
,
a
*NL*
shrill
and
warning
whoop
;
and
then
sank
,
as
it
were
,
by
magic
,
from
*NL*
before
the
sight
of
their
visitors
.
The
naked
,
tawny
bodies
of
the
*NL*
crouching
urchins
blended
so
nicely
at
that
hour
,
with
the
withered
*NL*
herbage
,
that
at
first
it
seemed
as
if
the
earth
had
,
in
truth
,
*NL*
swallowed
up
their
forms
;
though
when
surprise
permitted
Duncan
to
bend
*NL*
his
look
more
curiously
about
the
spot
,
he
found
it
everywhere
met
by
*NL*
dark
,
quick
,
and
rolling
eyeballs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gathering
no
encouragement
from
this
startling
presage
of
the
nature
of
*NL*
the
scrutiny
he
was
likely
to
undergo
from
the
more
mature
judgments
*NL*
of
the
men
,
there
was
an
instant
when
the
young
soldier
would
have
*NL*
retreated
.
It
was
,
however
,
too
late
to
appear
to
hesitate
.
The
cry
*NL*
of
the
children
had
drawn
a
dozen
warriors
to
the
door
of
the
nearest
*NL*
lodge
,
where
they
stood
clustered
in
a
dark
and
savage
group
,
gravely
*NL*
awaiting
the
nearer
approach
of
those
who
had
unexpectedly
come
among
*NL*
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
David
,
in
some
measure
familiarized
to
the
scene
,
led
the
way
with
a
*NL*
steadiness
that
no
slight
obstacle
was
likely
to
disconcert
,
into
this
*NL*
very
building
.
It
was
the
principal
edifice
of
the
village
,
though
*NL*
roughly
constructed
of
the
bark
and
branches
of
trees
;
being
the
lodge
*NL*
in
which
the
tribe
held
its
councils
and
public
meetings
during
their
*NL*
temporary
residence
on
the
borders
of
the
English
province
.
Duncan
found
*NL*
it
difficult
to
assume
the
necessary
appearance
of
unconcern
,
as
he
*NL*
brushed
the
dark
and
powerful
frames
of
the
savages
who
thronged
its
*NL*
threshold
;
but
,
conscious
that
his
existence
depended
on
his
presence
of
*NL*
mind
,
he
trusted
to
the
discretion
of
his
companion
,
whose
footsteps
he
*NL*
closely
followed
,
endeavoring
,
as
he
proceeded
,
to
rally
his
thoughts
*NL*
for
the
occasion
.
His
blood
curdled
when
he
found
himself
in
absolute
*NL*
contact
with
such
fierce
and
implacable
enemies
;
but
he
so
far
mastered
*NL*
his
feelings
as
to
pursue
his
way
into
the
center
of
the
lodge
,
with
an
*NL*
exterior
that
did
not
betray
the
weakness
.
Imitating
the
example
of
the
*NL*
deliberate
Gamut
,
he
drew
a
bundle
of
fragrant
brush
from
beneath
a
pile
*NL*
that
filled
the
corner
of
the
hut
,
and
seated
himself
in
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
soon
as
their
visitor
had
passed
,
the
observant
warriors
fell
back
*NL*
from
the
entrance
,
and
arranging
themselves
about
him
,
they
seemed
*NL*
patiently
to
await
the
moment
when
it
might
comport
with
the
dignity
of
*NL*
the
stranger
to
speak
.
By
far
the
greater
number
stood
leaning
,
in
lazy
,
*NL*
lounging
attitudes
,
against
the
upright
posts
that
supported
the
crazy
*NL*
building
,
while
three
or
four
of
the
oldest
and
most
distinguished
of
*NL*
the
chiefs
placed
themselves
on
the
earth
a
little
more
in
advance
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
flaring
torch
was
burning
in
the
place
,
and
set
its
red
glare
from
*NL*
face
to
face
and
figure
to
figure
,
as
it
waved
in
the
currents
of
air
.
*NL*
Duncan
profited
by
its
light
to
read
the
probable
character
of
his
*NL*
reception
,
in
the
countenances
of
his
hosts
.
But
his
ingenuity
availed
*NL*
him
little
,
against
the
cold
artifices
of
the
people
he
had
encountered
.
*NL*
The
chiefs
in
front
scarce
cast
a
glance
at
his
person
,
keeping
their
*NL*
eyes
on
the
ground
,
with
an
air
that
might
have
been
intended
for
*NL*
respect
,
but
which
it
was
quite
easy
to
construe
into
distrust
.
The
men
*NL*
in
the
shadow
were
less
reserved
.
Duncan
soon
detected
their
searching
,
*NL*
but
stolen
,
looks
which
,
in
truth
,
scanned
his
person
and
attire
inch
by
*NL*
inch
;
leaving
no
emotion
of
the
countenance
,
no
gesture
,
no
line
of
the
*NL*
paint
,
nor
even
the
fashion
of
a
garment
,
unheeded
,
and
without
comment
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
one
whose
hair
was
beginning
to
be
sprinkled
with
gray
,
but
*NL*
whose
sinewy
limbs
and
firm
tread
announced
that
he
was
still
equal
to
*NL*
the
duties
of
manhood
,
advanced
out
of
the
gloom
of
a
corner
,
whither
he
*NL*
had
probably
posted
himself
to
make
his
observations
unseen
,
and
*NL*
spoke
.
He
used
the
language
of
the
Wyandots
,
or
Hurons
;
his
words
were
,
*NL*
consequently
,
unintelligible
to
Heyward
,
though
they
seemed
,
by
the
*NL*
gestures
that
accompanied
them
,
to
be
uttered
more
in
courtesy
than
*NL*
anger
.
The
latter
shook
his
head
,
and
made
a
gesture
indicative
of
his
*NL*
inability
to
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
none
of
my
brothers
speak
the
French
or
the
English
?
''
he
said
,
in
*NL*
the
former
language
,
looking
about
him
from
countenance
to
countenance
,
*NL*
in
hopes
of
finding
a
nod
of
assent
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
more
than
one
had
turned
,
as
if
to
catch
the
meaning
of
his
*NL*
words
,
they
remained
unanswered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
be
grieved
to
think
,
''
continued
Duncan
,
speaking
slowly
,
and
*NL*
using
the
simplest
French
of
which
he
was
the
master
,
``
to
believe
that
*NL*
none
of
this
wise
and
brave
nation
understand
the
language
that
the
*NL*
`
Grand
Monarque
'
uses
when
he
talks
to
his
children
.
His
heart
would
be
*NL*
heavy
did
he
believe
his
red
warriors
paid
him
so
little
respect
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
long
and
grave
pause
succeeded
,
during
which
no
movement
of
a
limb
,
*NL*
nor
any
expression
of
an
eye
,
betrayed
the
expression
produced
by
his
*NL*
remark
.
Duncan
,
who
knew
that
silence
was
a
virtue
among
his
hosts
,
*NL*
gladly
had
recourse
to
the
custom
,
in
order
to
arrange
his
ideas
.
At
*NL*
length
the
same
warrior
who
had
before
addressed
him
replied
,
by
dryly
*NL*
demanding
,
in
the
language
of
the
Canadas
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
our
Great
Father
speaks
to
his
people
,
is
it
with
the
tongue
of
a
*NL*
Huron
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
knows
no
difference
in
his
children
,
whether
the
color
of
the
skin
*NL*
be
red
,
or
black
,
or
white
,
''
returned
Duncan
,
evasively
;
``
though
chiefly
*NL*
is
he
satisfied
with
the
brave
Hurons
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
what
manner
will
he
speak
,
''
demanded
the
wary
chief
,
``
when
the
*NL*
runners
count
to
him
the
scalps
which
five
nights
ago
grew
on
the
heads
*NL*
of
the
Yengeese
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
were
his
enemies
,
''
said
Duncan
,
shuddering
involuntarily
;
``
and
*NL*
doubtless
,
he
will
say
,
it
is
good
;
my
Hurons
are
very
gallant
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Our
Canada
father
does
not
think
it
.
Instead
of
looking
forward
to
*NL*
reward
his
Indians
,
his
eyes
are
turned
backward
.
He
sees
the
dead
*NL*
Yengeese
,
but
no
Huron
.
What
can
this
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
great
chief
,
like
him
,
has
more
thoughts
than
tongues
.
He
looks
to
*NL*
see
that
no
enemies
are
on
his
trail
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
canoe
of
a
dead
warrior
will
not
float
on
the
Horican
,
''
returned
*NL*
the
savage
,
gloomily
.
``
His
ears
are
open
to
the
Delawares
,
who
are
not
*NL*
our
friends
,
and
they
fill
them
with
lies
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
can
not
be
.
See
;
he
has
bid
me
,
who
am
a
man
that
knows
the
art
of
*NL*
healing
,
to
go
to
his
children
,
the
red
Hurons
of
the
great
lakes
,
and
*NL*
ask
if
any
are
sick
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Another
silence
succeeded
this
annunciation
of
the
character
Duncan
*NL*
had
assumed
.
Every
eye
was
simultaneously
bent
on
his
person
,
as
if
*NL*
to
inquire
into
the
truth
or
falsehood
of
the
declaration
,
with
an
*NL*
intelligence
and
keenness
that
caused
the
subject
of
their
scrutiny
to
*NL*
tremble
for
the
result
.
He
was
,
however
,
relieved
again
by
the
former
*NL*
speaker
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
the
cunning
men
of
the
Canadas
paint
their
skins
?
''
the
Huron
coldly
*NL*
continued
;
``
we
have
heard
them
boast
that
their
faces
were
pale
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
an
Indian
chief
comes
among
his
white
fathers
,
''
returned
Duncan
,
*NL*
with
great
steadiness
,
``
he
lays
aside
his
buffalo
robe
,
to
carry
the
*NL*
shirt
that
is
offered
him
.
My
brothers
have
given
me
paint
and
I
wear
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
low
murmur
of
applause
announced
that
the
compliment
of
the
tribe
was
*NL*
favorably
received
.
The
elderly
chief
made
a
gesture
of
commendation
,
*NL*
which
was
answered
by
most
of
his
companions
,
who
each
threw
forth
*NL*
a
hand
and
uttered
a
brief
exclamation
of
pleasure
.
Duncan
began
to
*NL*
breathe
more
freely
,
believing
that
the
weight
of
his
examination
was
*NL*
past
;
and
,
as
he
had
already
prepared
a
simple
and
probable
tale
to
*NL*
support
his
pretended
occupation
,
his
hopes
of
ultimate
success
grew
*NL*
brighter
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
silence
of
a
few
moments
,
as
if
adjusting
his
thoughts
,
in
*NL*
order
to
make
a
suitable
answer
to
the
declaration
their
guests
had
*NL*
just
given
,
another
warrior
arose
,
and
placed
himself
in
an
attitude
to
*NL*
speak
.
While
his
lips
were
yet
in
the
act
of
parting
,
a
low
but
fearful
*NL*
sound
arose
from
the
forest
,
and
was
immediately
succeeded
by
a
high
,
*NL*
shrill
yell
,
that
was
drawn
out
,
until
it
equaled
the
longest
and
most
*NL*
plaintive
howl
of
the
wolf
.
The
sudden
and
terrible
interruption
caused
*NL*
Duncan
to
start
from
his
seat
,
unconscious
of
everything
but
the
effect
*NL*
produced
by
so
frightful
a
cry
.
At
the
same
moment
,
the
warriors
glided
*NL*
in
a
body
from
the
lodge
,
and
the
outer
air
was
filled
with
loud
shouts
,
*NL*
that
nearly
drowned
those
awful
sounds
,
which
were
still
ringing
beneath
*NL*
the
arches
of
the
woods
.
Unable
to
command
himself
any
longer
,
the
youth
*NL*
broke
from
the
place
,
and
presently
stood
in
the
center
of
a
disorderly
*NL*
throng
,
that
included
nearly
everything
having
life
,
within
the
limits
*NL*
of
the
encampment
.
Men
,
women
,
and
children
;
the
aged
,
the
inform
,
the
*NL*
active
,
and
the
strong
,
were
alike
abroad
,
some
exclaiming
aloud
,
others
*NL*
clapping
their
hands
with
a
joy
that
seemed
frantic
,
and
all
expressing
*NL*
their
savage
pleasure
in
some
unexpected
event
.
Though
astounded
,
at
*NL*
first
,
by
the
uproar
,
Heyward
was
soon
enabled
to
find
its
solution
by
*NL*
the
scene
that
followed
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
yet
lingered
sufficient
light
in
the
heavens
to
exhibit
those
*NL*
bright
openings
among
the
tree-tops
,
where
different
paths
left
the
*NL*
clearing
to
enter
the
depths
of
the
wilderness
.
Beneath
one
of
them
,
a
*NL*
line
of
warriors
issued
from
the
woods
,
and
advanced
slowly
toward
the
*NL*
dwellings
.
One
in
front
bore
a
short
pole
,
on
which
,
as
it
afterwards
*NL*
appeared
,
were
suspended
several
human
scalps
.
The
startling
sounds
that
*NL*
Duncan
had
heard
were
what
the
whites
have
not
inappropriately
called
*NL*
the
``
death-hallo
''
;
and
each
repetition
of
the
cry
was
intended
to
*NL*
announce
to
the
tribe
the
fate
of
an
enemy
.
Thus
far
the
knowledge
of
*NL*
Heyward
assisted
him
in
the
explanation
;
and
as
he
now
knew
that
the
*NL*
interruption
was
caused
by
the
unlooked-for
return
of
a
successful
*NL*
war-party
,
every
disagreeable
sensation
was
quieted
in
inward
*NL*
congratulation
,
for
the
opportune
relief
and
insignificance
it
conferred
*NL*
on
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
at
the
distance
of
a
few
hundred
feet
from
the
lodges
the
newly
*NL*
arrived
warriors
halted
.
Their
plaintive
and
terrific
cry
,
which
was
*NL*
intended
to
represent
equally
the
wailings
of
the
dead
and
the
triumph
*NL*
to
the
victors
,
had
entirely
ceased
.
One
of
their
number
now
called
*NL*
aloud
,
in
words
that
were
far
from
appalling
,
though
not
more
*NL*
intelligible
to
those
for
whose
ears
they
were
intended
,
than
their
*NL*
expressive
yells
.
It
would
be
difficult
to
convey
a
suitable
idea
of
the
*NL*
savage
ecstasy
with
which
the
news
thus
imparted
was
received
.
The
whole
*NL*
encampment
,
in
a
moment
,
became
a
scene
of
the
most
violent
bustle
and
*NL*
commotion
.
The
warriors
drew
their
knives
,
and
flourishing
them
,
they
*NL*
arranged
themselves
in
two
lines
,
forming
a
lane
that
extended
from
*NL*
the
war-party
to
the
lodges
.
The
squaws
seized
clubs
,
axes
,
or
whatever
*NL*
weapon
of
offense
first
offered
itself
to
their
hands
,
and
rushed
*NL*
eagerly
to
act
their
part
in
the
cruel
game
that
was
at
hand
.
Even
*NL*
the
children
would
not
be
excluded
;
but
boys
,
little
able
to
wield
the
*NL*
instruments
,
tore
the
tomahawks
from
the
belts
of
their
fathers
,
and
*NL*
stole
into
the
ranks
,
apt
imitators
of
the
savage
traits
exhibited
by
*NL*
their
parents
.
*NL*
*NL*
Large
piles
of
brush
lay
scattered
about
the
clearing
,
and
a
wary
and
*NL*
aged
squaw
was
occupied
in
firing
as
many
as
might
serve
to
light
the
*NL*
coming
exhibition
.
As
the
flame
arose
,
its
power
exceeded
that
of
*NL*
the
parting
day
,
and
assisted
to
render
objects
at
the
same
time
more
*NL*
distinct
and
more
hideous
.
The
whole
scene
formed
a
striking
picture
,
*NL*
whose
frame
was
composed
of
the
dark
and
tall
border
of
pines
.
The
*NL*
warriors
just
arrived
were
the
most
distant
figures
.
A
little
in
advance
*NL*
stood
two
men
,
who
were
apparently
selected
from
the
rest
,
as
the
*NL*
principal
actors
in
what
was
to
follow
.
The
light
was
not
strong
enough
*NL*
to
render
their
features
distinct
,
though
it
was
quite
evident
that
*NL*
they
were
governed
by
very
different
emotions
.
While
one
stood
erect
and
*NL*
firm
,
prepared
to
meet
his
fate
like
a
hero
,
the
other
bowed
his
head
,
*NL*
as
if
palsied
by
terror
or
stricken
with
shame
.
The
high-spirited
Duncan
*NL*
felt
a
powerful
impulse
of
admiration
and
pity
toward
the
former
,
though
*NL*
no
opportunity
could
offer
to
exhibit
his
generous
emotions
.
He
watched
*NL*
his
slightest
movement
,
however
,
with
eager
eyes
;
and
,
as
he
traced
*NL*
the
fine
outline
of
his
admirably
proportioned
and
active
frame
,
he
*NL*
endeavored
to
persuade
himself
,
that
,
if
the
powers
of
man
,
seconded
*NL*
by
such
noble
resolution
,
could
bear
one
harmless
through
so
severe
a
*NL*
trial
,
the
youthful
captive
before
him
might
hope
for
success
in
the
*NL*
hazardous
race
he
was
about
to
run
.
Insensibly
the
young
man
drew
nigher
*NL*
to
the
swarthy
lines
of
the
Hurons
,
and
scarcely
breathed
,
so
intense
*NL*
became
his
interest
in
the
spectacle
.
Just
then
the
signal
yell
was
*NL*
given
,
and
the
momentary
quiet
which
had
preceded
it
was
broken
by
a
*NL*
burst
of
cries
,
that
far
exceeded
any
before
heard
.
The
more
abject
of
*NL*
the
two
victims
continued
motionless
;
but
the
other
bounded
from
the
*NL*
place
at
the
cry
,
with
the
activity
and
swiftness
of
a
deer
.
Instead
of
*NL*
rushing
through
the
hostile
lines
,
as
had
been
expected
,
he
just
entered
*NL*
the
dangerous
defile
,
and
before
time
was
given
for
a
single
blow
,
*NL*
turned
short
,
and
leaping
the
heads
of
a
row
of
children
,
he
gained
at
*NL*
once
the
exterior
and
safer
side
of
the
formidable
array
.
The
artifice
*NL*
was
answered
by
a
hundred
voices
raised
in
imprecations
;
and
the
whole
*NL*
of
the
excited
multitude
broke
from
their
order
,
and
spread
themselves
*NL*
about
the
place
in
wild
confusion
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
dozen
blazing
piles
now
shed
their
lurid
brightness
on
the
place
,
*NL*
which
resembled
some
unhallowed
and
supernatural
arena
,
in
which
*NL*
malicious
demons
had
assembled
to
act
their
bloody
and
lawless
rites
.
*NL*
The
forms
in
the
background
looked
like
unearthly
beings
,
gliding
before
*NL*
the
eye
,
and
cleaving
the
air
with
frantic
and
unmeaning
gestures
;
while
*NL*
the
savage
passions
of
such
as
passed
the
flames
were
rendered
fearfully
*NL*
distinct
by
the
gleams
that
shot
athwart
their
inflamed
visages
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
will
easily
be
understood
that
,
amid
such
a
concourse
of
vindictive
*NL*
enemies
,
no
breathing
time
was
allowed
the
fugitive
.
There
was
a
single
*NL*
moment
when
it
seemed
as
if
he
would
have
reached
the
forest
,
but
the
*NL*
whole
body
of
his
captors
threw
themselves
before
him
,
and
drove
him
*NL*
back
into
the
center
of
his
relentless
persecutors
.
Turning
like
a
*NL*
headed
deer
,
he
shot
,
with
the
swiftness
of
an
arrow
,
through
a
pillar
*NL*
of
forked
flame
,
and
passing
the
whole
multitude
harmless
,
he
appeared
*NL*
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
clearing
.
Here
,
too
,
he
was
met
and
turned
*NL*
by
a
few
of
the
older
and
more
subtle
of
the
Hurons
.
Once
more
he
tried
*NL*
the
throng
,
as
if
seeking
safety
in
its
blindness
,
and
then
several
*NL*
moments
succeeded
,
during
which
Duncan
believed
the
active
and
*NL*
courageous
young
stranger
was
lost
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
could
be
distinguished
but
a
dark
mass
of
human
forms
tossed
*NL*
and
involved
in
inexplicable
confusion
.
Arms
,
gleaming
knives
,
and
*NL*
formidable
clubs
,
appeared
above
them
,
but
the
blows
were
evidently
*NL*
given
at
random
.
The
awful
effect
was
heightened
by
the
piercing
shrieks
*NL*
of
the
women
and
the
fierce
yells
of
the
warriors
.
Now
and
then
Duncan
*NL*
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
light
form
cleaving
the
air
in
some
desperate
*NL*
bound
,
and
he
rather
hoped
than
believed
that
the
captive
yet
retained
*NL*
the
command
of
his
astonishing
powers
of
activity
.
Suddenly
the
*NL*
multitude
rolled
backward
,
and
approached
the
spot
where
he
himself
*NL*
stood
.
The
heavy
body
in
the
rear
pressed
upon
the
women
and
children
*NL*
in
front
,
and
bore
them
to
the
earth
.
The
stranger
reappeared
in
the
*NL*
confusion
.
Human
power
could
not
,
however
,
much
longer
endure
so
*NL*
severe
a
trial
.
Of
this
the
captive
seemed
conscious
.
Profiting
by
*NL*
the
momentary
opening
,
he
darted
from
among
the
warriors
,
and
made
a
*NL*
desperate
,
and
what
seemed
to
Duncan
a
final
effort
to
gain
the
wood
.
*NL*
As
if
aware
that
no
danger
was
to
be
apprehended
from
the
young
soldier
,
*NL*
the
fugitive
nearly
brushed
his
person
in
his
flight
.
A
tall
and
*NL*
powerful
Huron
,
who
had
husbanded
his
forces
,
pressed
close
upon
his
*NL*
heels
,
and
with
an
uplifted
arm
menaced
a
fatal
blow
.
Duncan
thrust
*NL*
forth
a
foot
,
and
the
shock
precipitated
the
eager
savage
headlong
,
many
*NL*
feet
in
advance
of
his
intended
victim
.
Thought
itself
is
not
quicker
*NL*
than
was
the
motion
with
which
the
latter
profited
by
the
advantage
;
he
*NL*
turned
,
gleamed
like
a
meteor
again
before
the
eyes
of
Duncan
,
and
,
at
*NL*
the
next
moment
,
when
the
latter
recovered
his
recollection
,
and
gazed
*NL*
around
in
quest
of
the
captive
,
he
saw
him
quietly
leaning
against
a
*NL*
small
painted
post
,
which
stood
before
the
door
of
the
principal
lodge
.
*NL*
*NL*
Apprehensive
that
the
part
he
had
taken
in
the
escape
might
prove
fatal
*NL*
to
himself
,
Duncan
left
the
place
without
delay
.
He
followed
the
crowd
,
*NL*
which
drew
nigh
the
lodges
,
gloomy
and
sullen
,
like
any
other
multitude
*NL*
that
had
been
disappointed
in
an
execution
.
Curiosity
,
or
perhaps
a
*NL*
better
feeling
,
induced
him
to
approach
the
stranger
.
He
found
him
,
*NL*
standing
with
one
arm
cast
about
the
protecting
post
,
and
breathing
*NL*
thick
and
hard
,
after
his
exertions
,
but
disdaining
to
permit
a
single
*NL*
sign
of
suffering
to
escape
.
His
person
was
now
protected
by
immemorial
*NL*
and
sacred
usage
,
until
the
tribe
in
council
had
deliberated
and
*NL*
determined
on
his
fate
.
It
was
not
difficult
,
however
,
to
foretell
the
*NL*
result
,
if
any
presage
could
be
drawn
from
the
feelings
of
those
who
*NL*
crowded
the
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
term
of
abuse
known
to
the
Huron
vocabulary
that
the
*NL*
disappointed
women
did
not
lavishly
expend
on
the
successful
stranger
.
*NL*
They
flouted
at
his
efforts
,
and
told
him
,
with
bitter
scoffs
,
that
his
*NL*
feet
were
better
than
his
hands
;
and
that
he
merited
wings
,
while
he
*NL*
knew
not
the
use
of
an
arrow
or
a
knife
.
To
all
this
the
captive
made
*NL*
no
reply
;
but
was
content
to
preserve
an
attitude
in
which
dignity
was
*NL*
singularly
blended
with
disdain
.
Exasperated
as
much
by
his
composure
*NL*
as
by
his
good-fortune
,
their
words
became
unintelligible
,
and
were
*NL*
succeeded
by
shrill
,
piercing
yells
.
Just
then
the
crafty
squaw
,
who
had
*NL*
taken
the
necessary
precaution
to
fire
the
piles
,
made
her
way
through
*NL*
the
throng
,
and
cleared
a
place
for
herself
in
front
of
the
captive
.
The
*NL*
squalid
and
withered
person
of
this
hag
might
well
have
obtained
for
her
*NL*
the
character
of
possessing
more
than
human
cunning
.
Throwing
back
her
*NL*
light
vestment
,
she
stretched
forth
her
long
,
skinny
arm
,
in
derision
,
*NL*
and
using
the
language
of
the
Lenape
,
as
more
intelligible
to
the
*NL*
subject
of
her
gibes
,
she
commenced
aloud
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
you
,
Delaware
,
''
she
said
,
snapping
her
fingers
in
his
face
;
``
your
*NL*
nation
is
a
race
of
women
,
and
the
hoe
is
better
fitted
to
your
hands
*NL*
than
the
gun
.
Your
squaws
are
the
mothers
of
deer
;
but
if
a
bear
,
or
*NL*
a
wildcat
,
or
a
serpent
were
born
among
you
,
ye
would
flee
.
The
Huron
*NL*
girls
shall
make
you
petticoats
,
and
we
will
find
you
a
husband
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
burst
of
savage
laughter
succeeded
this
attack
,
during
which
the
soft
*NL*
and
musical
merriment
of
the
younger
females
strangely
chimed
with
*NL*
the
cracked
voice
of
their
older
and
more
malignant
companion
.
But
the
*NL*
stranger
was
superior
to
all
their
efforts
.
His
head
was
immovable
;
nor
*NL*
did
he
betray
the
slightest
consciousness
that
any
were
present
,
except
*NL*
when
his
haughty
eye
rolled
toward
the
dusky
forms
of
the
warriors
,
who
*NL*
stalked
in
the
background
silent
and
sullen
observers
of
the
scene
.
*NL*
*NL*
Infuriated
at
the
self-command
of
the
captive
,
the
woman
placed
her
arms
*NL*
akimbo
;
and
,
throwing
herself
into
a
posture
of
defiance
,
she
broke
*NL*
out
anew
,
in
a
torrent
of
words
that
no
art
of
ours
could
commit
*NL*
successfully
to
paper
.
Her
breath
was
,
however
,
expended
in
vain
;
for
,
*NL*
although
distinguished
in
her
nation
as
a
proficient
in
the
art
of
*NL*
abuse
,
she
was
permitted
to
work
herself
into
such
a
fury
as
actually
to
*NL*
foam
at
the
mouth
,
without
causing
a
muscle
to
vibrate
in
the
motionless
*NL*
figure
of
the
stranger
.
The
effect
of
his
indifference
began
to
extend
*NL*
itself
to
the
other
spectators
;
and
a
youngster
,
who
was
just
quitting
*NL*
the
condition
of
a
boy
to
enter
the
state
of
manhood
,
attempted
to
*NL*
assist
the
termagant
,
by
flourishing
his
tomahawk
before
their
victim
,
*NL*
and
adding
his
empty
boasts
to
the
taunts
of
the
women
.
Then
,
indeed
,
*NL*
the
captive
turned
his
face
toward
the
light
,
and
looked
down
on
the
*NL*
stripling
with
an
expression
that
was
superior
to
contempt
.
At
the
next
*NL*
moment
he
resumed
his
quiet
and
reclining
attitude
against
the
post
.
But
*NL*
the
change
of
posture
had
permitted
Duncan
to
exchange
glances
with
the
*NL*
firm
and
piercing
eyes
of
Uncas
.
*NL*
*NL*
Breathless
with
amazement
,
and
heavily
oppressed
with
the
critical
*NL*
situation
of
his
friend
,
Heyward
recoiled
before
the
look
,
trembling
*NL*
lest
its
meaning
might
,
in
some
unknown
manner
,
hasten
the
prisoner
's
*NL*
fate
.
There
was
not
,
however
,
any
instant
cause
for
such
an
*NL*
apprehension
.
Just
then
a
warrior
forced
his
way
into
the
exasperated
*NL*
crowd
.
Motioning
the
women
and
children
aside
with
a
stern
gesture
,
he
*NL*
took
Uncas
by
the
arm
,
and
led
him
toward
the
door
of
the
council-lodge
.
*NL*
Thither
all
the
chiefs
,
and
most
of
the
distinguished
warriors
,
*NL*
followed
;
among
whom
the
anxious
Heyward
found
means
to
enter
without
*NL*
attracting
any
dangerous
attention
to
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
minutes
were
consumed
in
disposing
of
those
present
in
a
manner
*NL*
suitable
to
their
rank
and
influence
in
the
tribe
.
An
order
very
similar
*NL*
to
that
adopted
in
the
preceding
interview
was
observed
;
the
aged
and
*NL*
superior
chiefs
occupying
the
area
of
the
spacious
apartment
,
within
*NL*
the
powerful
light
of
a
glaring
torch
,
while
their
juniors
and
inferiors
*NL*
were
arranged
in
the
background
,
presenting
a
dark
outline
of
swarthy
*NL*
and
marked
visages
.
In
the
very
center
of
the
lodge
,
immediately
under
*NL*
an
opening
that
admitted
the
twinkling
light
of
one
or
two
stars
,
stood
*NL*
Uncas
,
calm
,
elevated
,
and
collected
.
His
high
and
haughty
carriage
was
*NL*
not
lost
on
his
captors
,
who
often
bent
their
looks
on
his
person
,
with
*NL*
eyes
which
,
while
they
lost
none
of
their
inflexibility
of
purpose
,
*NL*
plainly
betrayed
their
admiration
of
the
stranger
's
daring
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
case
was
different
with
the
individual
whom
Duncan
had
observed
to
*NL*
stand
forth
with
his
friend
,
previously
to
the
desperate
trial
of
speed
;
*NL*
and
who
,
instead
of
joining
in
the
chase
,
had
remained
,
throughout
*NL*
its
turbulent
uproar
,
like
a
cringing
statue
,
expressive
of
shame
and
*NL*
disgrace
.
Though
not
a
hand
had
been
extended
to
greet
him
,
nor
yet
an
*NL*
eye
had
condescended
to
watch
his
movements
,
he
had
also
entered
the
*NL*
lodge
,
as
though
impelled
by
a
fate
to
whose
decrees
he
submitted
,
*NL*
seemingly
,
without
a
struggle
.
Heyward
profited
by
the
first
opportunity
*NL*
to
gaze
in
his
face
,
secretly
apprehensive
he
might
find
the
features
*NL*
of
another
acquaintance
;
but
they
proved
to
be
those
of
a
stranger
,
and
,
*NL*
what
was
still
more
inexplicable
,
of
one
who
bore
all
the
distinctive
*NL*
marks
of
a
Huron
warrior
.
Instead
of
mingling
with
his
tribe
,
however
,
*NL*
he
sat
apart
,
a
solitary
being
in
a
multitude
,
his
form
shrinking
into
a
*NL*
crouching
and
abject
attitude
,
as
if
anxious
to
fill
as
little
space
as
*NL*
possible
.
When
each
individual
had
taken
his
proper
station
,
and
silence
*NL*
reigned
in
the
place
,
the
gray-haired
chief
already
introduced
to
the
*NL*
reader
,
spoke
aloud
,
in
the
language
of
the
Lenni
Lenape
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Delaware
,
''
he
said
,
``
though
one
of
a
nation
of
women
,
you
have
proved
*NL*
yourself
a
man
.
I
would
give
you
food
;
but
he
who
eats
with
a
Huron
*NL*
should
become
his
friend
.
Rest
in
peace
till
the
morning
sun
,
when
our
*NL*
last
words
shall
be
spoken
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Seven
nights
,
and
as
many
summer
days
,
have
I
fasted
on
the
trail
of
*NL*
the
Hurons
,
''
Uncas
coldly
replied
;
``
the
children
of
the
Lenape
know
how
*NL*
to
travel
the
path
of
the
just
without
lingering
to
eat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Two
of
my
young
men
are
in
pursuit
of
your
companion
,
''
resumed
the
*NL*
other
,
without
appearing
to
regard
the
boast
of
his
captive
;
``
when
they
*NL*
get
back
,
then
will
our
wise
man
say
to
you
`
live
'
or
`
die
'
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
a
Huron
no
ears
?
''
scornfully
exclaimed
Uncas
;
``
twice
,
since
he
has
*NL*
been
your
prisoner
,
has
the
Delaware
heard
a
gun
that
he
knows
.
Your
*NL*
young
men
will
never
come
back
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
short
and
sullen
pause
succeeded
this
bold
assertion
.
Duncan
,
who
*NL*
understood
the
Mohican
to
allude
to
the
fatal
rifle
of
the
scout
,
bent
*NL*
forward
in
earnest
observation
of
the
effect
it
might
produce
on
the
*NL*
conquerors
;
but
the
chief
was
content
with
simply
retorting
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
the
Lenape
are
so
skillful
,
why
is
one
of
their
bravest
warriors
*NL*
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
followed
in
the
steps
of
a
flying
coward
,
and
fell
into
a
snare
.
The
*NL*
cunning
beaver
may
be
caught
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
Uncas
thus
replied
,
he
pointed
with
his
finger
toward
the
solitary
*NL*
Huron
,
but
without
deigning
to
bestow
any
other
notice
on
so
unworthy
*NL*
an
object
.
The
words
of
the
answer
and
the
air
of
the
speaker
produced
*NL*
a
strong
sensation
among
his
auditors
.
Every
eye
rolled
sullenly
toward
*NL*
the
individual
indicated
by
the
simple
gesture
,
and
a
low
,
threatening
*NL*
murmur
passed
through
the
crowd
.
The
ominous
sounds
reached
the
outer
*NL*
door
,
and
the
women
and
children
pressing
into
the
throng
,
no
gap
had
*NL*
been
left
,
between
shoulder
and
shoulder
,
that
was
not
now
filled
with
*NL*
the
dark
lineaments
of
some
eager
and
curious
human
countenance
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
,
the
more
aged
chiefs
,
in
the
center
,
communed
with
each
*NL*
other
in
short
and
broken
sentences
.
Not
a
word
was
uttered
that
did
not
*NL*
convey
the
meaning
of
the
speaker
,
in
the
simplest
and
most
energetic
*NL*
form
.
Again
,
a
long
and
deeply
solemn
pause
took
place
.
It
was
known
,
*NL*
by
all
present
,
to
be
the
brave
precursor
of
a
weighty
and
important
*NL*
judgment
.
They
who
composed
the
outer
circle
of
faces
were
on
tiptoe
to
*NL*
gaze
;
and
even
the
culprit
for
an
instant
forgot
his
shame
in
a
deeper
*NL*
emotion
,
and
exposed
his
abject
features
,
in
order
to
cast
an
anxious
*NL*
and
troubled
glance
at
the
dark
assemblage
of
chiefs
.
The
silence
was
*NL*
finally
broken
by
the
aged
warrior
so
often
named
.
He
arose
from
the
*NL*
earth
,
and
moving
past
the
immovable
form
of
Uncas
,
placed
himself
in
*NL*
a
dignified
attitude
before
the
offender
.
At
that
moment
,
the
withered
*NL*
squaw
already
mentioned
moved
into
the
circle
,
in
a
slow
,
sidling
sort
*NL*
of
a
dance
,
holding
the
torch
,
and
muttering
the
indistinct
words
of
*NL*
what
might
have
been
a
species
of
incantation
.
Though
her
presence
was
*NL*
altogether
an
intrusion
,
it
was
unheeded
.
*NL*
*NL*
Approaching
Uncas
,
she
held
the
blazing
brand
in
such
a
manner
as
to
*NL*
cast
its
red
glare
on
his
person
,
and
to
expose
the
slightest
emotion
of
*NL*
his
countenance
.
The
Mohican
maintained
his
firm
and
haughty
attitude
;
*NL*
and
his
eyes
,
so
far
from
deigning
to
meet
her
inquisitive
look
,
dwelt
*NL*
steadily
on
the
distance
,
as
though
it
penetrated
the
obstacles
*NL*
which
impeded
the
view
and
looked
into
futurity
.
Satisfied
with
her
*NL*
examination
,
she
left
him
,
with
a
slight
expression
of
pleasure
,
and
*NL*
proceeded
to
practise
the
same
trying
experiment
on
her
delinquent
*NL*
countryman
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
Huron
was
in
his
war
paint
,
and
very
little
of
a
finely
molded
*NL*
form
was
concealed
by
his
attire
.
The
light
rendered
every
limb
and
*NL*
joint
discernible
,
and
Duncan
turned
away
in
horror
when
he
saw
they
*NL*
were
writhing
in
irrepressible
agony
.
The
woman
was
commencing
a
low
*NL*
and
plaintive
howl
at
the
sad
and
shameful
spectacle
,
when
the
chief
put
*NL*
forth
his
hand
and
gently
pushed
her
aside
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Reed-that-bends
,
''
he
said
,
addressing
the
young
culprit
by
name
,
and
in
*NL*
his
proper
language
,
``
though
the
Great
Spirit
has
made
you
pleasant
to
*NL*
the
eyes
,
it
would
have
been
better
that
you
had
not
been
born
.
Your
*NL*
tongue
is
loud
in
the
village
,
but
in
battle
it
is
still
.
None
of
my
*NL*
young
men
strike
the
tomahawk
deeper
into
the
war-post
--
none
of
them
so
*NL*
lightly
on
the
Yengeese
.
The
enemy
know
the
shape
of
your
back
,
but
they
*NL*
have
never
seen
the
color
of
your
eyes
.
Three
times
have
they
called
on
*NL*
you
to
come
,
and
as
often
did
you
forget
to
answer
.
Your
name
will
never
*NL*
be
mentioned
again
in
your
tribe
--
it
is
already
forgotten
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
chief
slowly
uttered
these
words
,
pausing
impressively
between
*NL*
each
sentence
,
the
culprit
raised
his
face
,
in
deference
to
the
other
's
*NL*
rank
and
years
.
Shame
,
horror
,
and
pride
struggled
in
its
lineaments
.
*NL*
His
eye
,
which
was
contracted
with
inward
anguish
,
gleamed
on
the
*NL*
persons
of
those
whose
breath
was
his
fame
;
and
the
latter
emotion
for
*NL*
an
instant
predominated
.
He
arose
to
his
feet
,
and
baring
his
bosom
,
*NL*
looked
steadily
on
the
keen
,
glittering
knife
,
that
was
already
upheld
*NL*
by
his
inexorable
judge
.
As
the
weapon
passed
slowly
into
his
heart
he
*NL*
even
smiled
,
as
if
in
joy
at
having
found
death
less
dreadful
than
he
*NL*
had
anticipated
,
and
fell
heavily
on
his
face
,
at
the
feet
of
the
rigid
*NL*
and
unyielding
form
of
Uncas
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
squaw
gave
a
loud
and
plaintive
yell
,
dashed
the
torch
to
the
*NL*
earth
,
and
buried
everything
in
darkness
.
The
whole
shuddering
group
*NL*
of
spectators
glided
from
the
lodge
like
troubled
sprites
;
and
Duncan
*NL*
thought
that
he
and
the
yet
throbbing
body
of
the
victim
of
an
Indian
*NL*
judgment
had
now
become
its
only
tenants
.

CHAPTER
24
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thus
spoke
the
sage
:
the
kings
without
delay
*NL*
Dissolve
the
council
,
and
their
chief
obey
.
''
*NL*
--
Pope
's
Iliad
*NL*
*NL*
A
single
moment
served
to
convince
the
youth
that
he
was
mistaken
.
A
*NL*
hand
was
laid
,
with
a
powerful
pressure
,
on
his
arm
,
and
the
low
voice
*NL*
of
Uncas
muttered
in
his
ear
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Hurons
are
dogs
.
The
sight
of
a
coward
's
blood
can
never
make
a
*NL*
warrior
tremble
.
The
`
Gray
Head
'
and
the
Sagamore
are
safe
,
and
the
*NL*
rifle
of
Hawkeye
is
not
asleep
.
Go
--
Uncas
and
the
`
Open
Hand
'
are
now
*NL*
strangers
.
It
is
enough
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Heyward
would
gladly
have
heard
more
,
but
a
gentle
push
from
his
friend
*NL*
urged
him
toward
the
door
,
and
admonished
him
of
the
danger
that
might
*NL*
attend
the
discovery
of
their
intercourse
.
Slowly
and
reluctantly
*NL*
yielding
to
the
necessity
,
he
quitted
the
place
,
and
mingled
with
the
*NL*
throng
that
hovered
nigh
.
The
dying
fires
in
the
clearing
cast
a
dim
and
*NL*
uncertain
light
on
the
dusky
figures
that
were
silently
stalking
to
*NL*
and
fro
;
and
occasionally
a
brighter
gleam
than
common
glanced
into
the
*NL*
lodge
,
and
exhibited
the
figure
of
Uncas
still
maintaining
its
upright
*NL*
attitude
near
the
dead
body
of
the
Huron
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
knot
of
warriors
soon
entered
the
place
again
,
and
reissuing
,
*NL*
they
bore
the
senseless
remains
into
the
adjacent
woods
.
After
this
*NL*
termination
of
the
scene
,
Duncan
wandered
among
the
lodges
,
unquestioned
*NL*
and
unnoticed
,
endeavoring
to
find
some
trace
of
her
in
whose
behalf
he
*NL*
incurred
the
risk
he
ran
.
In
the
present
temper
of
the
tribe
it
would
*NL*
have
been
easy
to
have
fled
and
rejoined
his
companions
,
had
such
a
*NL*
wish
crossed
his
mind
.
But
,
in
addition
to
the
never-ceasing
anxiety
on
*NL*
account
of
Alice
,
a
fresher
though
feebler
interest
in
the
fate
of
Uncas
*NL*
assisted
to
chain
him
to
the
spot
.
He
continued
,
therefore
,
to
stray
*NL*
from
hut
to
hut
,
looking
into
each
only
to
encounter
additional
*NL*
disappointment
,
until
he
had
made
the
entire
circuit
of
the
village
.
*NL*
Abandoning
a
species
of
inquiry
that
proved
so
fruitless
,
he
retraced
*NL*
his
steps
to
the
council-lodge
,
resolved
to
seek
and
question
David
,
in
*NL*
order
to
put
an
end
to
his
doubts
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
reaching
the
building
,
which
had
proved
alike
the
seat
of
judgment
*NL*
and
the
place
of
execution
,
the
young
man
found
that
the
excitement
*NL*
had
already
subsided
.
The
warriors
had
reassembled
,
and
were
now
calmly
*NL*
smoking
,
while
they
conversed
gravely
on
the
chief
incidents
of
their
*NL*
recent
expedition
to
the
head
of
the
Horican
.
Though
the
return
of
*NL*
Duncan
was
likely
to
remind
them
of
his
character
,
and
the
suspicious
*NL*
circumstances
of
his
visit
,
it
produced
no
visible
sensation
.
So
far
,
*NL*
the
terrible
scene
that
had
just
occurred
proved
favorable
to
his
views
,
*NL*
and
he
required
no
other
prompter
than
his
own
feelings
to
convince
him
*NL*
of
the
expediency
of
profiting
by
so
unexpected
an
advantage
.
*NL*
*NL*
Without
seeming
to
hesitate
,
he
walked
into
the
lodge
,
and
took
his
seat
*NL*
with
a
gravity
that
accorded
admirably
with
the
deportment
of
his
hosts
.
*NL*
A
hasty
but
searching
glance
sufficed
to
tell
him
that
,
though
Uncas
*NL*
still
remained
where
he
had
left
him
,
David
had
not
reappeared
.
No
other
*NL*
restraint
was
imposed
on
the
former
than
the
watchful
looks
of
a
young
*NL*
Huron
,
who
had
placed
himself
at
hand
;
though
an
armed
warrior
leaned
*NL*
against
the
post
that
formed
one
side
of
the
narrow
doorway
.
In
every
*NL*
other
respect
,
the
captive
seemed
at
liberty
;
still
he
was
excluded
from
*NL*
all
participation
in
the
discourse
,
and
possessed
much
more
of
the
air
*NL*
of
some
finely
molded
statue
than
a
man
having
life
and
volition
.
*NL*
*NL*
Heyward
had
too
recently
witnessed
a
frightful
instance
of
the
prompt
*NL*
punishments
of
the
people
into
whose
hands
he
had
fallen
to
hazard
an
*NL*
exposure
by
any
officious
boldness
.
He
would
greatly
have
preferred
*NL*
silence
and
meditation
to
speech
,
when
a
discovery
of
his
real
*NL*
condition
might
prove
so
instantly
fatal
.
Unfortunately
for
this
prudent
*NL*
resolution
,
his
entertainers
appeared
otherwise
disposed
.
He
had
not
*NL*
long
occupied
the
seat
wisely
taken
a
little
in
the
shade
,
when
another
*NL*
of
the
elder
warriors
,
who
spoke
the
French
language
,
addressed
him
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
Canada
father
does
not
forget
his
children
,
''
said
the
chief
;
``
I
*NL*
thank
him
.
An
evil
spirit
lives
in
the
wife
of
one
of
my
young
men
.
Can
*NL*
the
cunning
stranger
frighten
him
away
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Heyward
possessed
some
knowledge
of
the
mummery
practised
among
the
*NL*
Indians
,
in
the
cases
of
such
supposed
visitations
.
He
saw
,
at
a
glance
,
*NL*
that
the
circumstance
might
possibly
be
improved
to
further
his
own
*NL*
ends
.
It
would
,
therefore
,
have
been
difficult
,
just
then
to
have
*NL*
uttered
a
proposal
that
would
have
given
him
more
satisfaction
.
Aware
*NL*
of
the
necessity
of
preserving
the
dignity
of
his
imaginary
character
,
*NL*
however
,
he
repressed
his
feelings
,
and
answered
with
suitable
mystery
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Spirits
differ
;
some
yield
to
the
power
of
wisdom
,
while
others
are
too
*NL*
strong
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
brother
is
a
great
medicine
,
''
said
the
cunning
savage
;
``
he
will
*NL*
try
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
gesture
of
assent
was
the
answer
.
The
Huron
was
content
with
the
*NL*
assurance
,
and
,
resuming
his
pipe
,
he
awaited
the
proper
moment
to
*NL*
move
.
The
impatient
Heyward
,
inwardly
execrating
the
cold
customs
of
*NL*
the
savages
,
which
required
such
sacrifices
to
appearance
,
was
fain
to
*NL*
assume
an
air
of
indifference
,
equal
to
that
maintained
by
the
chief
,
*NL*
who
was
,
in
truth
,
a
near
relative
of
the
afflicted
woman
.
The
minutes
*NL*
lingered
,
and
the
delay
had
seemed
an
hour
to
the
adventurer
in
*NL*
empiricism
,
when
the
Huron
laid
aside
his
pipe
and
drew
his
robe
across
*NL*
his
breast
,
as
if
about
to
lead
the
way
to
the
lodge
of
the
invalid
.
*NL*
Just
then
,
a
warrior
of
powerful
frame
,
darkened
the
door
,
and
stalking
*NL*
silently
among
the
attentive
group
,
he
seated
himself
on
one
end
of
the
*NL*
low
pile
of
brush
which
sustained
Duncan
.
The
latter
cast
an
impatient
*NL*
look
at
his
neighbor
,
and
felt
his
flesh
creep
with
uncontrollable
*NL*
horror
when
he
found
himself
in
actual
contact
with
Magua
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sudden
return
of
this
artful
and
dreaded
chief
caused
a
delay
in
the
*NL*
departure
of
the
Huron
.
Several
pipes
,
that
had
been
extinguished
,
were
*NL*
lighted
again
;
while
the
newcomer
,
without
speaking
a
word
,
drew
his
*NL*
tomahawk
from
his
girdle
,
and
filling
the
bowl
on
its
head
began
to
*NL*
inhale
the
vapors
of
the
weed
through
the
hollow
handle
,
with
as
much
*NL*
indifference
as
if
he
had
not
been
absent
two
weary
days
on
a
long
and
*NL*
toilsome
hunt
.
Ten
minutes
,
which
appeared
so
many
ages
to
Duncan
,
might
*NL*
have
passed
in
this
manner
;
and
the
warriors
were
fairly
enveloped
in
a
*NL*
cloud
of
white
smoke
before
any
of
them
spoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Welcome
!
''
one
at
length
uttered
;
``
has
my
friend
found
the
moose
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
young
men
stagger
under
their
burdens
,
''
returned
Magua
.
``
Let
*NL*
`
Reed-that-bends
'
go
on
the
hunting
path
;
he
will
meet
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
deep
and
awful
silence
succeeded
the
utterance
of
the
forbidden
name
.
*NL*
Each
pipe
dropped
from
the
lips
of
its
owner
as
though
all
had
inhaled
*NL*
an
impurity
at
the
same
instant
.
The
smoke
wreathed
above
their
heads
in
*NL*
little
eddies
,
and
curling
in
a
spiral
form
it
ascended
swiftly
through
*NL*
the
opening
in
the
roof
of
the
lodge
,
leaving
the
place
beneath
clear
of
*NL*
its
fumes
,
and
each
dark
visage
distinctly
visible
.
The
looks
of
most
of
*NL*
the
warriors
were
riveted
on
the
earth
;
though
a
few
of
the
younger
and
*NL*
less
gifted
of
the
party
suffered
their
wild
and
glaring
eyeballs
to
*NL*
roll
in
the
direction
of
a
white-headed
savage
,
who
sat
between
two
of
*NL*
the
most
venerated
chiefs
of
the
tribe
.
There
was
nothing
in
the
air
*NL*
or
attire
of
this
Indian
that
would
seem
to
entitle
him
to
such
a
*NL*
distinction
.
The
former
was
rather
depressed
,
than
remarkable
for
the
*NL*
bearing
of
the
natives
;
and
the
latter
was
such
as
was
commonly
worn
*NL*
by
the
ordinary
men
of
the
nation
.
Like
most
around
him
for
more
than
*NL*
a
minute
his
look
,
too
,
was
on
the
ground
;
but
,
trusting
his
eyes
at
*NL*
length
to
steal
a
glance
aside
,
he
perceived
that
he
was
becoming
an
*NL*
object
of
general
attention
.
Then
he
arose
and
lifted
his
voice
in
the
*NL*
general
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
a
lie
,
''
he
said
;
``
I
had
no
son
.
He
who
was
called
by
that
name
*NL*
is
forgotten
;
his
blood
was
pale
,
and
it
came
not
from
the
veins
of
a
*NL*
Huron
;
the
wicked
Chippewas
cheated
my
squaw
.
The
Great
Spirit
has
said
,
*NL*
that
the
family
of
Wiss-entush
should
end
;
he
is
happy
who
knows
that
*NL*
the
evil
of
his
race
dies
with
himself
.
I
have
done
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
speaker
,
who
was
the
father
of
the
recreant
young
Indian
,
looked
*NL*
round
and
about
him
,
as
if
seeking
commendation
of
his
stoicism
in
the
*NL*
eyes
of
the
auditors
.
But
the
stern
customs
of
his
people
had
made
too
*NL*
severe
an
exaction
of
the
feeble
old
man
.
The
expression
of
his
eye
*NL*
contradicted
his
figurative
and
boastful
language
,
while
every
muscle
in
*NL*
his
wrinkled
visage
was
working
with
anguish
.
Standing
a
single
minute
*NL*
to
enjoy
his
bitter
triumph
,
he
turned
away
,
as
if
sickening
at
the
gaze
*NL*
of
men
,
and
,
veiling
his
face
in
his
blanket
,
he
walked
from
the
lodge
*NL*
with
the
noiseless
step
of
an
Indian
seeking
,
in
the
privacy
of
his
own
*NL*
abode
,
the
sympathy
of
one
like
himself
,
aged
,
forlorn
and
childless
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Indians
,
who
believe
in
the
hereditary
transmission
of
virtues
and
*NL*
defects
in
character
,
suffered
him
to
depart
in
silence
.
Then
,
with
an
*NL*
elevation
of
breeding
that
many
in
a
more
cultivated
state
of
society
*NL*
might
profitably
emulate
,
one
of
the
chiefs
drew
the
attention
of
the
*NL*
young
men
from
the
weakness
they
had
just
witnessed
,
by
saying
,
in
a
*NL*
cheerful
voice
,
addressing
himself
in
courtesy
to
Magua
,
as
the
newest
*NL*
comer
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Delawares
have
been
like
bears
after
the
honey
pots
,
prowling
*NL*
around
my
village
.
But
who
has
ever
found
a
Huron
asleep
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
darkness
of
the
impending
cloud
which
precedes
a
burst
of
thunder
*NL*
was
not
blacker
than
the
brow
of
Magua
as
he
exclaimed
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Delawares
of
the
Lakes
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
so
.
They
who
wear
the
petticoats
of
squaws
,
on
their
own
river
.
One
*NL*
of
them
has
been
passing
the
tribe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
my
young
men
take
his
scalp
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
His
legs
were
good
,
though
his
arm
is
better
for
the
hoe
than
the
*NL*
tomahawk
,
''
returned
the
other
,
pointing
to
the
immovable
form
of
Uncas
.
*NL*
*NL*
Instead
of
manifesting
any
womanish
curiosity
to
feast
his
eyes
with
the
*NL*
sight
of
a
captive
from
a
people
he
was
known
to
have
so
much
reason
to
*NL*
hate
,
Magua
continued
to
smoke
,
with
the
meditative
air
that
he
usually
*NL*
maintained
,
when
there
was
no
immediate
call
on
his
cunning
or
his
*NL*
eloquence
.
Although
secretly
amazed
at
the
facts
communicated
by
the
*NL*
speech
of
the
aged
father
,
he
permitted
himself
to
ask
no
questions
,
*NL*
reserving
his
inquiries
for
a
more
suitable
moment
.
It
was
only
after
a
*NL*
sufficient
interval
that
he
shook
the
ashes
from
his
pipe
,
replaced
the
*NL*
tomahawk
,
tightened
his
girdle
,
and
arose
,
casting
for
the
first
time
a
*NL*
glance
in
the
direction
of
the
prisoner
,
who
stood
a
little
behind
him
.
*NL*
The
wary
,
though
seemingly
abstracted
Uncas
,
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
*NL*
movement
,
and
turning
suddenly
to
the
light
,
their
looks
met
.
Near
a
*NL*
minute
these
two
bold
and
untamed
spirits
stood
regarding
one
another
*NL*
steadily
in
the
eye
,
neither
quailing
in
the
least
before
the
fierce
*NL*
gaze
he
encountered
.
The
form
of
Uncas
dilated
,
and
his
nostrils
opened
*NL*
like
those
of
a
tiger
at
bay
;
but
so
rigid
and
unyielding
was
his
*NL*
posture
,
that
he
might
easily
have
been
converted
by
the
imagination
*NL*
into
an
exquisite
and
faultless
representation
of
the
warlike
deity
of
*NL*
his
tribe
.
The
lineaments
of
the
quivering
features
of
Magua
proved
more
*NL*
ductile
;
his
countenance
gradually
lost
its
character
of
defiance
in
an
*NL*
expression
of
ferocious
joy
,
and
heaving
a
breath
from
the
very
bottom
*NL*
of
his
chest
,
he
pronounced
aloud
the
formidable
name
of
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Le
Cerf
Agile
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Each
warrior
sprang
upon
his
feet
at
the
utterance
of
the
well-known
*NL*
appellation
,
and
there
was
a
short
period
during
which
the
stoical
*NL*
constancy
of
the
natives
was
completely
conquered
by
surprise
.
The
hated
*NL*
and
yet
respected
name
was
repeated
as
by
one
voice
,
carrying
the
*NL*
sound
even
beyond
the
limits
of
the
lodge
.
The
women
and
children
,
who
*NL*
lingered
around
the
entrance
,
took
up
the
words
in
an
echo
,
which
was
*NL*
succeeded
by
another
shrill
and
plaintive
howl
.
The
latter
was
not
yet
*NL*
ended
,
when
the
sensation
among
the
men
had
entirely
abated
.
Each
one
in
*NL*
presence
seated
himself
,
as
though
ashamed
of
his
precipitation
;
but
it
*NL*
was
many
minutes
before
their
meaning
eyes
ceased
to
roll
toward
their
*NL*
captive
,
in
curious
examination
of
a
warrior
who
had
so
often
proved
*NL*
his
prowess
on
the
best
and
proudest
of
their
nation
.
Uncas
enjoyed
his
*NL*
victory
,
but
was
content
with
merely
exhibiting
his
triumph
by
a
quiet
*NL*
smile
--
an
emblem
of
scorn
which
belongs
to
all
time
and
every
nation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Magua
caught
the
expression
,
and
raising
his
arm
,
he
shook
it
at
the
*NL*
captive
,
the
light
silver
ornaments
attached
to
his
bracelet
rattling
*NL*
with
the
trembling
agitation
of
the
limb
,
as
,
in
a
tone
of
vengeance
,
he
*NL*
exclaimed
,
in
English
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mohican
,
you
die
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
healing
waters
will
never
bring
the
dead
Hurons
to
life
,
''
returned
*NL*
Uncas
,
in
the
music
of
the
Delawares
;
``
the
tumbling
river
washes
their
*NL*
bones
;
their
men
are
squaws
:
their
women
owls
.
Go
!
call
together
the
*NL*
Huron
dogs
,
that
they
may
look
upon
a
warrior
,
My
nostrils
are
offended
;
*NL*
they
scent
the
blood
of
a
coward
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
latter
allusion
struck
deep
,
and
the
injury
rankled
.
Many
of
the
*NL*
Hurons
understood
the
strange
tongue
in
which
the
captive
spoke
,
among
*NL*
which
number
was
Magua
.
This
cunning
savage
beheld
,
and
instantly
*NL*
profited
by
his
advantage
.
Dropping
the
light
robe
of
skin
from
his
*NL*
shoulder
,
he
stretched
forth
his
arm
,
and
commenced
a
burst
of
his
*NL*
dangerous
and
artful
eloquence
.
However
much
his
influence
among
his
*NL*
people
had
been
impaired
by
his
occasional
and
besetting
weakness
,
as
*NL*
well
as
by
his
desertion
of
the
tribe
,
his
courage
and
his
fame
as
an
*NL*
orator
were
undeniable
.
He
never
spoke
without
auditors
,
and
rarely
*NL*
without
making
converts
to
his
opinions
.
On
the
present
occasion
,
his
*NL*
native
powers
were
stimulated
by
the
thirst
of
revenge
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
again
recounted
the
events
of
the
attack
on
the
island
at
Glenn
's
,
*NL*
the
death
of
his
associates
and
the
escape
of
their
most
formidable
*NL*
enemies
.
Then
he
described
the
nature
and
position
of
the
mount
whither
*NL*
he
had
led
such
captives
as
had
fallen
into
their
hands
.
Of
his
own
*NL*
bloody
intentions
toward
the
maidens
,
and
of
his
baffled
malice
he
made
*NL*
no
mention
,
but
passed
rapidly
on
to
the
surprise
of
the
party
by
``
La
*NL*
Longue
Carabine
,
''
and
its
fatal
termination
.
Here
he
paused
,
and
looked
*NL*
about
him
,
in
affected
veneration
for
the
departed
,
but
,
in
truth
,
*NL*
to
note
the
effect
of
his
opening
narrative
.
As
usual
,
every
eye
was
*NL*
riveted
on
his
face
.
Each
dusky
figure
seemed
a
breathing
statue
,
so
*NL*
motionless
was
the
posture
,
so
intense
the
attention
of
the
individual
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Magua
dropped
his
voice
which
had
hitherto
been
clear
,
strong
and
*NL*
elevated
,
and
touched
upon
the
merits
of
the
dead
.
No
quality
that
was
*NL*
likely
to
command
the
sympathy
of
an
Indian
escaped
his
notice
.
One
*NL*
had
never
been
known
to
follow
the
chase
in
vain
;
another
had
been
*NL*
indefatigable
on
the
trail
of
their
enemies
.
This
was
brave
,
that
*NL*
generous
.
In
short
,
he
so
managed
his
allusions
,
that
in
a
nation
which
*NL*
was
composed
of
so
few
families
,
he
contrived
to
strike
every
chord
that
*NL*
might
find
,
in
its
turn
,
some
breast
in
which
to
vibrate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
the
bones
of
my
young
men
,
''
he
concluded
,
``
in
the
burial-place
of
*NL*
the
Hurons
?
You
know
they
are
not
.
Their
spirits
are
gone
toward
the
*NL*
setting
sun
,
and
are
already
crossing
the
great
waters
,
to
the
happy
*NL*
hunting-grounds
.
But
they
departed
without
food
,
without
guns
or
knives
,
*NL*
without
moccasins
,
naked
and
poor
as
they
were
born
.
Shall
this
be
?
*NL*
Are
their
souls
to
enter
the
land
of
the
just
like
hungry
Iroquois
or
*NL*
unmanly
Delawares
,
or
shall
they
meet
their
friends
with
arms
in
their
*NL*
hands
and
robes
on
their
backs
?
What
will
our
fathers
think
the
tribes
*NL*
of
the
Wyandots
have
become
?
They
will
look
on
their
children
with
a
*NL*
dark
eye
,
and
say
,
`
Go
!
a
Chippewa
has
come
hither
with
the
name
of
a
*NL*
Huron
.
'
Brothers
,
we
must
not
forget
the
dead
;
a
red-skin
never
ceases
*NL*
to
remember
.
We
will
load
the
back
of
this
Mohican
until
he
staggers
*NL*
under
our
bounty
,
and
dispatch
him
after
my
young
men
.
They
call
to
us
*NL*
for
aid
,
though
our
ears
are
not
open
;
they
say
,
`
Forget
us
not
.
'
When
*NL*
they
see
the
spirit
of
this
Mohican
toiling
after
them
with
his
burden
,
*NL*
they
will
know
we
are
of
that
mind
.
Then
will
they
go
on
happy
;
and
our
*NL*
children
will
say
,
`
So
did
our
fathers
to
their
friends
,
so
must
we
do
*NL*
to
them
.
'
What
is
a
Yengee
?
we
have
slain
many
,
but
the
earth
is
still
*NL*
pale
.
A
stain
on
the
name
of
Huron
can
only
be
hid
by
blood
that
comes
*NL*
from
the
veins
of
an
Indian
.
Let
this
Delaware
die
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
effect
of
such
an
harangue
,
delivered
in
the
nervous
language
and
*NL*
with
the
emphatic
manner
of
a
Huron
orator
,
could
scarcely
be
mistaken
.
*NL*
Magua
had
so
artfully
blended
the
natural
sympathies
with
the
religious
*NL*
superstition
of
his
auditors
,
that
their
minds
,
already
prepared
by
*NL*
custom
to
sacrifice
a
victim
to
the
manes
of
their
countrymen
,
lost
*NL*
every
vestige
of
humanity
in
a
wish
for
revenge
.
One
warrior
in
*NL*
particular
,
a
man
of
wild
and
ferocious
mien
,
had
been
conspicuous
for
*NL*
the
attention
he
had
given
to
the
words
of
the
speaker
.
His
countenance
*NL*
had
changed
with
each
passing
emotion
,
until
it
settled
into
a
look
*NL*
of
deadly
malice
.
As
Magua
ended
he
arose
and
,
uttering
the
yell
of
a
*NL*
demon
,
his
polished
little
axe
was
seen
glancing
in
the
torchlight
as
*NL*
he
whirled
it
above
his
head
.
The
motion
and
the
cry
were
too
sudden
*NL*
for
words
to
interrupt
his
bloody
intention
.
It
appeared
as
if
a
bright
*NL*
gleam
shot
from
his
hand
,
which
was
crossed
at
the
same
moment
by
a
*NL*
dark
and
powerful
line
.
The
former
was
the
tomahawk
in
its
passage
;
the
*NL*
latter
the
arm
that
Magua
darted
forward
to
divert
its
aim
.
The
quick
*NL*
and
ready
motion
of
the
chief
was
not
entirely
too
late
.
The
keen
weapon
*NL*
cut
the
war
plume
from
the
scalping
tuft
of
Uncas
,
and
passed
through
*NL*
the
frail
wall
of
the
lodge
as
though
it
were
hurled
from
some
*NL*
formidable
engine
.
*NL*
*NL*
Duncan
had
seen
the
threatening
action
,
and
sprang
upon
his
feet
,
with
*NL*
a
heart
which
,
while
it
leaped
into
his
throat
,
swelled
with
the
most
*NL*
generous
resolution
in
behalf
of
his
friend
.
A
glance
told
him
that
the
*NL*
blow
had
failed
,
and
terror
changed
to
admiration
.
Uncas
stood
still
,
*NL*
looking
his
enemy
in
the
eye
with
features
that
seemed
superior
to
*NL*
emotion
.
Marble
could
not
be
colder
,
calmer
,
or
steadier
than
the
*NL*
countenance
he
put
upon
this
sudden
and
vindictive
attack
.
Then
,
as
if
*NL*
pitying
a
want
of
skill
which
had
proved
so
fortunate
to
himself
,
he
*NL*
smiled
,
and
muttered
a
few
words
of
contempt
in
his
own
tongue
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
!
''
said
Magua
,
after
satisfying
himself
of
the
safety
of
the
captive
;
*NL*
``
the
sun
must
shine
on
his
shame
;
the
squaws
must
see
his
flesh
tremble
,
*NL*
or
our
revenge
will
be
like
the
play
of
boys
.
Go
!
take
him
where
there
*NL*
is
silence
;
let
us
see
if
a
Delaware
can
sleep
at
night
,
and
in
the
*NL*
morning
die
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
men
whose
duty
it
was
to
guard
the
prisoner
instantly
passed
*NL*
their
ligaments
of
bark
across
his
arms
,
and
led
him
from
the
lodge
,
*NL*
amid
a
profound
and
ominous
silence
.
It
was
only
as
the
figure
of
Uncas
*NL*
stood
in
the
opening
of
the
door
that
his
firm
step
hesitated
.
There
he
*NL*
turned
,
and
,
in
the
sweeping
and
haughty
glance
that
he
threw
around
*NL*
the
circle
of
his
enemies
,
Duncan
caught
a
look
which
he
was
glad
to
*NL*
construe
into
an
expression
that
he
was
not
entirely
deserted
by
hope
.
*NL*
*NL*
Magua
was
content
with
his
success
,
or
too
much
occupied
with
his
secret
*NL*
purposes
to
push
his
inquiries
any
further
.
Shaking
his
mantle
,
and
*NL*
folding
it
on
his
bosom
,
he
also
quitted
the
place
,
without
pursuing
a
*NL*
subject
which
might
have
proved
so
fatal
to
the
individual
at
his
elbow
.
*NL*
Notwithstanding
his
rising
resentment
,
his
natural
firmness
,
and
his
*NL*
anxiety
on
behalf
of
Uncas
,
Heyward
felt
sensibly
relieved
by
the
*NL*
absence
of
so
dangerous
and
so
subtle
a
foe
.
The
excitement
produced
*NL*
by
the
speech
gradually
subsided
.
The
warriors
resumed
their
seats
and
*NL*
clouds
of
smoke
once
more
filled
the
lodge
.
For
near
half
an
hour
,
not
*NL*
a
syllable
was
uttered
,
or
scarcely
a
look
cast
aside
;
a
grave
and
*NL*
meditative
silence
being
the
ordinary
succession
to
every
scene
of
*NL*
violence
and
commotion
among
these
beings
,
who
were
alike
so
impetuous
*NL*
and
yet
so
self-restrained
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
chief
,
who
had
solicited
the
aid
of
Duncan
,
finished
his
pipe
,
*NL*
he
made
a
final
and
successful
movement
toward
departing
.
A
motion
of
a
*NL*
finger
was
the
intimation
he
gave
the
supposed
physician
to
follow
;
and
*NL*
passing
through
the
clouds
of
smoke
,
Duncad
was
glad
,
on
more
accounts
*NL*
than
one
,
to
be
able
at
last
to
breathe
the
pure
air
of
a
cool
and
*NL*
refreshing
summer
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
Instead
of
pursuing
his
way
among
those
lodges
where
Heyward
had
already
*NL*
made
his
unsuccessful
search
,
his
companion
turned
aside
,
and
proceeded
*NL*
directly
toward
the
base
of
an
adjacent
mountain
,
which
overhung
the
*NL*
temporary
village
.
A
thicket
of
brush
skirted
its
foot
,
and
it
became
*NL*
necessary
to
proceed
through
a
crooked
and
narrow
path
.
The
boys
had
*NL*
resumed
their
sports
in
the
clearing
,
and
were
enacting
a
mimic
chase
*NL*
to
the
post
among
themselves
.
In
order
to
render
their
games
as
like
the
*NL*
reality
as
possible
,
one
of
the
boldest
of
their
number
had
conveyed
a
*NL*
few
brands
into
some
piles
of
tree-tops
that
had
hitherto
escaped
the
*NL*
burning
.
The
blaze
of
one
of
these
fires
lighted
the
way
of
the
chief
*NL*
and
Duncan
,
and
gave
a
character
of
additional
wildness
to
the
rude
*NL*
scenery
.
At
a
little
distance
from
a
bald
rock
,
and
directly
in
its
*NL*
front
,
they
entered
a
grassy
opening
,
which
they
prepared
to
cross
.
Just
*NL*
then
fresh
fuel
was
added
to
the
fire
,
and
a
powerful
light
penetrated
*NL*
even
to
that
distant
spot
.
It
fell
upon
the
white
surface
of
the
*NL*
mountain
,
and
was
reflected
downward
upon
a
dark
and
mysterious-looking
*NL*
being
that
arose
,
unexpectedly
,
in
their
path
.
The
Indian
paused
,
as
if
*NL*
doubtful
whether
to
proceed
,
and
permitted
his
companion
to
approach
his
*NL*
side
.
A
large
black
ball
,
which
at
first
seemed
stationary
,
now
began
*NL*
to
move
in
a
manner
that
to
the
latter
was
inexplicable
.
Again
the
fire
*NL*
brightened
and
its
glare
fell
more
distinctly
on
the
object
.
Then
even
*NL*
Duncan
knew
it
,
by
its
restless
and
sidling
attitudes
,
which
kept
the
*NL*
upper
part
of
its
form
in
constant
motion
,
while
the
animal
itself
*NL*
appeared
seated
,
to
be
a
bear
.
Though
it
growled
loudly
and
fiercely
,
*NL*
and
there
were
instants
when
its
glistening
eyeballs
might
be
seen
,
*NL*
it
gave
no
other
indications
of
hostility
.
The
Huron
,
at
least
,
seemed
*NL*
assured
that
the
intentions
of
this
singular
intruder
were
peaceable
,
*NL*
for
after
giving
it
an
attentive
examination
,
he
quietly
pursued
his
*NL*
course
.
*NL*
*NL*
Duncan
,
who
knew
that
the
animal
was
often
domesticated
among
the
*NL*
Indians
,
followed
the
example
of
his
companion
,
believing
that
some
*NL*
favorite
of
the
tribe
had
found
its
way
into
the
thicket
,
in
search
*NL*
of
food
.
They
passed
it
unmolested
.
Though
obliged
to
come
nearly
*NL*
in
contact
with
the
monster
,
the
Huron
,
who
had
at
first
so
warily
*NL*
determined
the
character
of
his
strange
visitor
,
was
now
content
with
*NL*
proceeding
without
wasting
a
moment
in
further
examination
;
but
Heyward
*NL*
was
unable
to
prevent
his
eyes
from
looking
backward
,
in
salutary
*NL*
watchfulness
against
attacks
in
the
rear
.
His
uneasiness
was
in
no
*NL*
degree
diminished
when
he
perceived
the
beast
rolling
along
their
path
,
*NL*
and
following
their
footsteps
.
He
would
have
spoken
,
but
the
Indian
at
*NL*
that
moment
shoved
aside
a
door
of
bark
,
and
entered
a
cavern
in
the
*NL*
bosom
of
the
mountain
.
*NL*
*NL*
Profiting
by
so
easy
a
method
of
retreat
,
Duncan
stepped
after
him
,
*NL*
and
was
gladly
closing
the
slight
cover
to
the
opening
,
when
he
felt
it
*NL*
drawn
from
his
hand
by
the
beast
,
whose
shaggy
form
immediately
darkened
*NL*
the
passage
.
They
were
now
in
a
straight
and
long
gallery
,
in
a
chasm
of
*NL*
the
rocks
,
where
retreat
without
encountering
the
animal
was
impossible
.
*NL*
Making
the
best
of
the
circumstances
,
the
young
man
pressed
forward
,
*NL*
keeping
as
close
as
possible
to
his
conductor
.
The
bear
growled
*NL*
frequently
at
his
heels
,
and
once
or
twice
its
enormous
paws
were
laid
*NL*
on
his
person
,
as
if
disposed
to
prevent
his
further
passage
into
the
*NL*
den
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
long
the
nerves
of
Heyward
would
have
sustained
him
in
this
*NL*
extraordinary
situation
,
it
might
be
difficult
to
decide
,
for
,
happily
,
*NL*
he
soon
found
relief
.
A
glimmer
of
light
had
constantly
been
in
their
*NL*
front
,
and
they
now
arrived
at
the
place
whence
it
proceeded
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
large
cavity
in
the
rock
had
been
rudely
fitted
to
answer
the
purposes
*NL*
of
many
apartments
.
The
subdivisions
were
simple
but
ingenious
,
being
*NL*
composed
of
stone
,
sticks
,
and
bark
,
intermingled
.
Openings
above
*NL*
admitted
the
light
by
day
,
and
at
night
fires
and
torches
supplied
the
*NL*
place
of
the
sun
.
Hither
the
Hurons
had
brought
most
of
their
valuables
,
*NL*
especially
those
which
more
particularly
pertained
to
the
nation
;
and
*NL*
hither
,
as
it
now
appeared
,
the
sick
woman
,
who
was
believed
to
be
*NL*
the
victim
of
supernatural
power
,
had
been
transported
also
,
under
an
*NL*
impression
that
her
tormentor
would
find
more
difficulty
in
making
his
*NL*
assaults
through
walls
of
stone
than
through
the
leafy
coverings
of
the
*NL*
lodges
.
The
apartment
into
which
Duncan
and
his
guide
first
entered
,
had
*NL*
been
exclusively
devoted
to
her
accommodation
.
The
latter
approached
her
*NL*
bedside
,
which
was
surrounded
by
females
,
in
the
center
of
whom
Heyward
*NL*
was
surprised
to
find
his
missing
friend
David
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
single
look
was
sufficient
to
apprise
the
pretended
leech
that
the
*NL*
invalid
was
far
beyond
his
powers
of
healing
.
She
lay
in
a
sort
of
*NL*
paralysis
,
indifferent
to
the
objects
which
crowded
before
her
sight
,
*NL*
and
happily
unconscious
of
suffering
.
Heyward
was
far
from
regretting
*NL*
that
his
mummeries
were
to
be
performed
on
one
who
was
much
too
ill
*NL*
to
take
an
interest
in
their
failure
or
success
.
The
slight
qualm
*NL*
of
conscience
which
had
been
excited
by
the
intended
deception
was
*NL*
instantly
appeased
,
and
he
began
to
collect
his
thoughts
,
in
order
to
*NL*
enact
his
part
with
suitable
spirit
,
when
he
found
he
was
about
to
be
*NL*
anticipated
in
his
skill
by
an
attempt
to
prove
the
power
of
music
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gamut
,
who
had
stood
prepared
to
pour
forth
his
spirit
in
song
when
the
*NL*
visitors
entered
,
after
delaying
a
moment
,
drew
a
strain
from
his
pipe
,
*NL*
and
commenced
a
hymn
that
might
have
worked
a
miracle
,
had
faith
in
its
*NL*
efficacy
been
of
much
avail
.
He
was
allowed
to
proceed
to
the
close
,
the
*NL*
Indians
respecting
his
imaginary
infirmity
,
and
Duncan
too
glad
of
the
*NL*
delay
to
hazard
the
slightest
interruption
.
As
the
dying
cadence
of
*NL*
his
strains
was
falling
on
the
ears
of
the
latter
,
he
started
aside
*NL*
at
hearing
them
repeated
behind
him
,
in
a
voice
half
human
and
half
*NL*
sepulchral
.
Looking
around
,
he
beheld
the
shaggy
monster
seated
on
end
*NL*
in
a
shadow
of
the
cavern
,
where
,
while
his
restless
body
swung
in
*NL*
the
uneasy
manner
of
the
animal
,
it
repeated
,
in
a
sort
of
low
growl
,
*NL*
sounds
,
if
not
words
,
which
bore
some
slight
resemblance
to
the
melody
*NL*
of
the
singer
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
effect
of
so
strange
an
echo
on
David
may
better
be
imagined
than
*NL*
described
.
His
eyes
opened
as
if
he
doubted
their
truth
;
and
his
voice
*NL*
became
instantly
mute
in
excess
of
wonder
.
A
deep-laid
scheme
,
of
*NL*
communicating
some
important
intelligence
to
Heyward
,
was
driven
from
*NL*
his
recollection
by
an
emotion
which
very
nearly
resembled
fear
,
but
*NL*
which
he
was
fain
to
believe
was
admiration
.
Under
its
influence
,
he
*NL*
exclaimed
aloud
:
``
She
expects
you
,
and
is
at
hand
''
;
and
precipitately
*NL*
left
the
cavern
.

--
Midsummer
Night
's
Dream
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
strange
blending
of
the
ridiculous
with
that
which
was
*NL*
solemn
in
this
scene
.
The
beast
still
continued
its
rolling
,
and
*NL*
apparently
untiring
movements
,
though
its
ludicrous
attempt
to
imitate
*NL*
the
melody
of
David
ceased
the
instant
the
latter
abandoned
the
field
.
*NL*
The
words
of
Gamut
were
,
as
has
been
seen
,
in
his
native
tongue
;
and
*NL*
to
Duncan
they
seem
pregnant
with
some
hidden
meaning
,
though
nothing
*NL*
present
assisted
him
in
discovering
the
object
of
their
allusion
.
A
*NL*
speedy
end
was
,
however
,
put
to
every
conjecture
on
the
subject
,
by
the
*NL*
manner
of
the
chief
,
who
advanced
to
the
bedside
of
the
invalid
,
and
*NL*
beckoned
away
the
whole
group
of
female
attendants
that
had
clustered
*NL*
there
to
witness
the
skill
of
the
stranger
.
He
was
implicitly
,
though
*NL*
reluctantly
,
obeyed
;
and
when
the
low
echo
which
rang
along
the
hollow
,
*NL*
natural
gallery
,
from
the
distant
closing
door
,
had
ceased
,
pointing
*NL*
toward
his
insensible
daughter
,
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
let
my
brother
show
his
power
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
unequivocally
called
on
to
exercise
the
functions
of
his
assumed
*NL*
character
,
Heyward
was
apprehensive
that
the
smallest
delay
might
prove
*NL*
dangerous
.
Endeavoring
,
then
,
to
collect
his
ideas
,
he
prepared
to
*NL*
perform
that
species
of
incantation
,
and
those
uncouth
rites
,
under
*NL*
which
the
Indian
conjurers
are
accustomed
to
conceal
their
ignorance
and
*NL*
impotency
.
It
is
more
than
probable
that
,
in
the
disordered
state
of
his
*NL*
thoughts
,
he
would
soon
have
fallen
into
some
suspicious
,
if
not
fatal
,
*NL*
error
had
not
his
incipient
attempts
been
interrupted
by
a
fierce
growl
*NL*
from
the
quadruped
.
Three
several
times
did
he
renew
his
efforts
to
*NL*
proceed
,
and
as
often
was
he
met
by
the
same
unaccountable
opposition
,
*NL*
each
interruption
seeming
more
savage
and
threatening
than
the
*NL*
preceding
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
cunning
ones
are
jealous
,
''
said
the
Huron
;
``
I
go
.
Brother
,
the
*NL*
woman
is
the
wife
of
one
of
my
bravest
young
men
;
deal
justly
by
her
.
*NL*
Peace
!
''
he
added
,
beckoning
to
the
discontented
beast
to
be
quiet
;
``
I
*NL*
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
chief
was
as
good
as
his
word
,
and
Duncan
now
found
himself
alone
*NL*
in
that
wild
and
desolate
abode
with
the
helpless
invalid
and
the
fierce
*NL*
and
dangerous
brute
.
The
latter
listened
to
the
movements
of
the
Indian
*NL*
with
that
air
of
sagacity
that
a
bear
is
known
to
possess
,
until
another
*NL*
echo
announced
that
he
had
also
left
the
cavern
,
when
it
turned
and
*NL*
came
waddling
up
to
Duncan
before
whom
it
seated
itself
in
its
natural
*NL*
attitude
,
erect
like
a
man
.
The
youth
looked
anxiously
about
him
for
*NL*
some
weapon
,
with
which
he
might
make
a
resistance
against
the
attack
he
*NL*
now
seriously
expected
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
seemed
,
however
,
as
if
the
humor
of
the
animal
had
suddenly
changed
.
*NL*
Instead
of
continuing
its
discontented
growls
,
or
manifesting
any
*NL*
further
signs
of
anger
,
the
whole
of
its
shaggy
body
shook
violently
,
as
*NL*
if
agitated
by
some
strange
internal
convulsion
.
The
huge
and
unwieldy
*NL*
talons
pawed
stupidly
about
the
grinning
muzzle
,
and
while
Heyward
kept
*NL*
his
eyes
riveted
on
its
movements
with
jealous
watchfulness
,
the
grim
*NL*
head
fell
on
one
side
and
in
its
place
appeared
the
honest
sturdy
*NL*
countenance
of
the
scout
,
who
was
indulging
from
the
bottom
of
his
soul
*NL*
in
his
own
peculiar
expression
of
merriment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hist
!
''
said
the
wary
woodsman
,
interrupting
Heyward
's
exclamation
of
*NL*
surprise
;
``
the
varlets
are
about
the
place
,
and
any
sounds
that
are
not
*NL*
natural
to
witchcraft
would
bring
them
back
upon
us
in
a
body
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
the
meaning
of
this
masquerade
;
and
why
you
have
attempted
so
*NL*
desperate
an
adventure
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
reason
and
calculation
are
often
outdone
by
accident
,
''
returned
the
*NL*
scout
.
``
But
,
as
a
story
should
always
commence
at
the
beginning
,
I
will
*NL*
tell
you
the
whole
in
order
.
After
we
parted
I
placed
the
commandant
*NL*
and
the
Sagamore
in
an
old
beaver
lodge
,
where
they
are
safer
from
*NL*
the
Hurons
than
they
would
be
in
the
garrison
of
Edward
;
for
your
*NL*
high
north-west
Indians
,
not
having
as
yet
got
the
traders
among
them
,
*NL*
continued
to
venerate
the
beaver
.
After
which
Uncas
and
I
pushed
for
the
*NL*
other
encampment
as
was
agreed
.
Have
you
seen
the
lad
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
my
great
grief
!
He
is
captive
,
and
condemned
to
die
at
the
rising
of
*NL*
the
sun
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
misgivings
that
such
would
be
his
fate
,
''
resumed
the
scout
,
in
*NL*
a
less
confident
and
joyous
tone
.
But
soon
regaining
his
naturally
firm
*NL*
voice
,
he
continued
:
``
His
bad
fortune
is
the
true
reason
of
my
being
*NL*
here
,
for
it
would
never
do
to
abandon
such
a
boy
to
the
Hurons
.
A
rare
*NL*
time
the
knaves
would
have
of
it
,
could
they
tie
`
The
Bounding
Elk
'
and
*NL*
`
The
Long
Carabine
'
,
as
they
call
me
,
to
the
same
stake
!
Though
why
they
*NL*
have
given
me
such
a
name
I
never
knew
,
there
being
as
little
likeness
*NL*
between
the
gifts
of
`
killdeer
'
and
the
performance
of
one
of
your
real
*NL*
Canada
carabynes
,
as
there
is
between
the
natur
'
of
a
pipe-stone
and
a
*NL*
flint
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Keep
to
your
tale
,
''
said
the
impatient
Heyward
;
``
we
know
not
at
what
*NL*
moment
the
Hurons
may
return
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
fear
of
them
.
A
conjurer
must
have
his
time
,
like
a
straggling
*NL*
priest
in
the
settlements
.
We
are
as
safe
from
interruption
as
a
*NL*
missionary
would
be
at
the
beginning
of
a
two
hours
'
discourse
.
Well
,
*NL*
Uncas
and
I
fell
in
with
a
return
party
of
the
varlets
;
the
lad
was
much
*NL*
too
forward
for
a
scout
;
nay
,
for
that
matter
,
being
of
hot
blood
,
he
*NL*
was
not
so
much
to
blame
;
and
,
after
all
,
one
of
the
Hurons
proved
a
*NL*
coward
,
and
in
fleeing
led
him
into
an
ambushment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
dearly
has
he
paid
for
the
weakness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
scout
significantly
passed
his
hand
across
his
own
throat
,
and
*NL*
nodded
,
as
if
he
said
,
``
I
comprehend
your
meaning
.
''
After
which
he
*NL*
continued
,
in
a
more
audible
though
scarcely
more
intelligible
language
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
After
the
loss
of
the
boy
I
turned
upon
the
Hurons
,
as
you
may
judge
.
*NL*
There
have
been
scrimmages
atween
one
or
two
of
their
outlyers
and
*NL*
myself
;
but
that
is
neither
here
nor
there
.
So
,
after
I
had
shot
the
*NL*
imps
,
I
got
in
pretty
nigh
to
the
lodges
without
further
commotion
.
Then
*NL*
what
should
luck
do
in
my
favor
but
lead
me
to
the
very
spot
where
one
*NL*
of
the
most
famous
conjurers
of
the
tribe
was
dressing
himself
,
as
I
*NL*
well
knew
,
for
some
great
battle
with
Satan
--
though
why
should
I
call
*NL*
that
luck
,
which
it
now
seems
was
an
especial
ordering
of
Providence
.
So
*NL*
a
judgmatical
rap
over
the
head
stiffened
the
lying
impostor
for
a
time
,
*NL*
and
leaving
him
a
bit
of
walnut
for
his
supper
,
to
prevent
an
uproar
,
*NL*
and
stringing
him
up
atween
two
saplings
,
I
made
free
with
his
finery
,
*NL*
and
took
the
part
of
the
bear
on
myself
,
in
order
that
the
operations
*NL*
might
proceed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
admirably
did
you
enact
the
character
;
the
animal
itself
might
have
*NL*
been
shamed
by
the
representation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lord
,
major
,
''
returned
the
flattered
woodsman
,
``
I
should
be
but
a
poor
*NL*
scholar
for
one
who
has
studied
so
long
in
the
wilderness
,
did
I
not
*NL*
know
how
to
set
forth
the
movements
or
natur
'
of
such
a
beast
.
Had
*NL*
it
been
now
a
catamount
,
or
even
a
full-size
panther
,
I
would
have
*NL*
embellished
a
performance
for
you
worth
regarding
.
But
it
is
no
such
*NL*
marvelous
feat
to
exhibit
the
feats
of
so
dull
a
beast
;
though
,
for
that
*NL*
matter
,
too
,
a
bear
may
be
overacted
.
Yes
,
yes
;
it
is
not
every
imitator
*NL*
that
knows
natur

may
be
outdone
easier
than
she
is
equaled

But
all
our
*NL*
work
is
yet
before
us
.
Where
is
the
gentle
one
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Heaven
knows

I
have
examined
every
lodge
in
the
village

without
*NL*
discovering
the
slightest
trace
of
her
presence
in
the
tribe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
heard
what
the
singer
said
,
as
he
left
us
:
`
She
is
at
hand
,
and
*NL*
expects
you

?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
been
compelled
to
believe
he
alluded
to
this
unhappy
woman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
simpleton
was
frightened
,
and
blundered
through
his
message
;
but
*NL*
he
had
a
deeper
meaning
.
Here
are
walls
enough
to
separate
the
whole
*NL*
settlement
.
A
bear
ought
to
climb
;
therefore
will
I
take
a
look
above
*NL*
them
.
There
may
be
honey-pots
hid
in
these
rocks
,
and
I
am
a
beast
,
you
*NL*
know
,
that
has
a
hankering
for
the
sweets
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
scout
looked
behind
him
,
laughing
at
his
own
conceit
,
while
he
*NL*
clambered
up
the
partition
,
imitating
,
as
he
went
,
the
clumsy
motions
of
*NL*
the
beast
he
represented
;
but
the
instant
the
summit
was
gained
he
made
*NL*
a
gesture
for
silence
,
and
slid
down
with
the
utmost
precipitation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
here
,
''
he
whispered
,
``
and
by
that
door
you
will
find
her
.
I
*NL*
would
have
spoken
a
word
of
comfort
to
the
afflicted
soul
;
but
the
sight
*NL*
of
such
a
monster
might
upset
her
reason
.
Though
for
that
matter
,
major
,
*NL*
you
are
none
of
the
most
inviting
yourself
in
your
paint
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Duncan
,
who
had
already
swung
eagerly
forward
,
drew
instantly
back
on
*NL*
hearing
these
discouraging
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Am
I
,
then
,
so
very
revolting
?
''
he
demanded
,
with
an
air
of
chagrin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
might
not
startle
a
wolf
,
or
turn
the
Royal
Americans
from
a
*NL*
discharge
;
but
I
have
seen
the
time
when
you
had
a
better
favored
look
;
*NL*
your
streaked
countenances
are
not
ill-judged
of
by
the
squaws
,
but
*NL*
young
women
of
white
blood
give
the
preference
to
their
own
color
.
See
,
''
*NL*
he
added
,
pointing
to
a
place
where
the
water
trickled
from
a
rock
,
*NL*
forming
a
little
crystal
spring
,
before
it
found
an
issue
through
the
*NL*
adjacent
crevices
;
``
you
may
easily
get
rid
of
the
Sagamore
's
daub
,
and
*NL*
when
you
come
back
I
will
try
my
hand
at
a
new
embellishment
.
It
's
*NL*
as
common
for
a
conjurer
to
alter
his
paint
as
for
a
buck
in
the
*NL*
settlements
to
change
his
finery
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
deliberate
woodsman
had
little
occasion
to
hunt
for
arguments
to
*NL*
enforce
his
advice
.
He
was
yet
speaking
when
Duncan
availed
himself
*NL*
of
the
water
.
In
a
moment
every
frightful
or
offensive
mark
was
*NL*
obliterated
,
and
the
youth
appeared
again
in
the
lineaments
with
which
*NL*
he
had
been
gifted
by
nature
.
Thus
prepared
for
an
interview
with
*NL*
his
mistress
,
he
took
a
hasty
leave
of
his
companion
,
and
disappeared
*NL*
through
the
indicated
passage
.
The
scout
witnessed
his
departure
with
*NL*
complacency
,
nodding
his
head
after
him
,
and
muttering
his
good
wishes
;
*NL*
after
which
he
very
coolly
set
about
an
examination
of
the
state
of
the
*NL*
larder
,
among
the
Hurons
,
the
cavern
,
among
other
purposes
,
being
used
*NL*
as
a
receptacle
for
the
fruits
of
their
hunts
.
*NL*
*NL*
Duncan
had
no
other
guide
than
a
distant
glimmering
light
,
which
served
,
*NL*
however
,
the
office
of
a
polar
star
to
the
lover
.
By
its
aid
he
was
*NL*
enabled
to
enter
the
haven
of
his
hopes
,
which
was
merely
another
*NL*
apartment
of
the
cavern
,
that
had
been
solely
appropriated
to
the
*NL*
safekeeping
of
so
important
a
prisoner
as
a
daughter
of
the
commandant
*NL*
of
William
Henry
.
It
was
profusely
strewed
with
the
plunder
of
that
*NL*
unlucky
fortress
.
In
the
midst
of
this
confusion
he
found
her
he
sought
,
*NL*
pale
,
anxious
and
terrified
,
but
lovely
.
David
had
prepared
her
for
such
*NL*
a
visit
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Duncan
!
''
she
exclaimed
,
in
a
voice
that
seemed
to
tremble
at
the
sounds
*NL*
created
by
itself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alice
!
''
he
answered
,
leaping
carelessly
among
trunks
,
boxes
,
arms
,
and
*NL*
furniture
,
until
he
stood
at
her
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
knew
that
you
would
never
desert
me
,
''
she
said
,
looking
up
with
*NL*
a
momentary
glow
on
her
otherwise
dejected
countenance
.
``
But
you
are
*NL*
alone
!
Grateful
as
it
is
to
be
thus
remembered
,
I
could
wish
to
think
*NL*
you
are
not
entirely
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Duncan
,
observing
that
she
trembled
in
a
manner
which
betrayed
her
*NL*
inability
to
stand
,
gently
induced
her
to
be
seated
,
while
he
recounted
*NL*
those
leading
incidents
which
it
has
been
our
task
to
accord
.
Alice
*NL*
listened
with
breathless
interest
;
and
though
the
young
man
touched
*NL*
lightly
on
the
sorrows
of
the
stricken
father
;
taking
care
,
however
,
not
*NL*
to
wound
the
self-love
of
his
auditor
,
the
tears
ran
as
freely
down
the
*NL*
cheeks
of
the
daughter
as
though
she
had
never
wept
before
.
The
soothing
*NL*
tenderness
of
Duncan
,
however
,
soon
quieted
the
first
burst
of
her
*NL*
emotions
,
and
she
then
heard
him
to
the
close
with
undivided
attention
,
*NL*
if
not
with
composure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
,
Alice
,
''
he
added
,
``
you
will
see
how
much
is
still
expected
*NL*
of
you
.
By
the
assistance
of
our
experienced
and
invaluable
friend
,
the
*NL*
scout
,
we
may
find
our
way
from
this
savage
people
,
but
you
will
have
to
*NL*
exert
your
utmost
fortitude
.
Remember
that
you
fly
to
the
arms
of
your
*NL*
venerable
parent
,
and
how
much
his
happiness
,
as
well
as
your
own
,
*NL*
depends
on
those
exertions
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
I
do
otherwise
for
a
father
who
has
done
so
much
for
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
for
me
,
too
,
''
continued
the
youth
,
gently
pressing
the
hand
he
held
*NL*
in
both
his
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
look
of
innocence
and
surprise
which
he
received
in
return
convinced
*NL*
Duncan
of
the
necessity
of
being
more
explicit
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
neither
the
place
nor
the
occasion
to
detain
you
with
selfish
*NL*
wishes
,
''
he
added
;
``
but
what
heart
loaded
like
mine
would
not
wish
to
*NL*
cast
its
burden
?
They
say
misery
is
the
closest
of
all
ties
;
our
common
*NL*
suffering
in
your
behalf
left
but
little
to
be
explained
between
your
*NL*
father
and
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
,
dearest
Cora

Duncan
;
surely
Cora
was
not
forgotten
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
forgotten

no

regretted
,
as
woman
was
seldom
mourned
before

Your
*NL*
venerable
father
knew
no
difference
between
his
children
;
but
I
--
Alice
,
*NL*
you
will
not
be
offended
when
I
say
,
that
to
me
her
worth
was
in
a
*NL*
degree
obscured

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
knew
not
the
merit
of
my
sister

said
Alice
,
withdrawing
her
*NL*
hand
;
``
of
you
she
ever
speaks
as
of
one
who
is
her
dearest
friend

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
gladly
believe
her
such

returned
Duncan
,
hastily
;
``
I
could
*NL*
wish
her
to
be
even
more
;
but
with
you
,
Alice
,
I
have
the
permission
of
*NL*
your
father
to
aspire
to
a
still
nearer
and
dearer
tie
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alice
trembled
violently
,
and
there
was
an
instant
during
which
she
bent
*NL*
her
face
aside
,
yielding
to
the
emotions
common
to
her
sex
;
but
they
*NL*
quickly
passed
away
,
leaving
her
mistress
of
her
deportment
,
if
not
of
*NL*
her
affections
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Heyward
,
''
she
said
,
looking
him
full
in
the
face
with
a
touching
*NL*
expression
of
innocence
and
dependency
,
``
give
me
the
sacred
presence
and
*NL*
the
holy
sanction
of
that
parent
before
you
urge
me
further
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Though
more
I
should
not
,
less
I
could
not
say
,
''
the
youth
was
about
to
*NL*
answer
,
when
he
was
interrupted
by
a
light
tap
on
his
shoulder
.
Starting
*NL*
to
his
feet
,
he
turned
,
and
,
confronting
the
intruder
,
his
looks
fell
on
*NL*
the
dark
form
and
malignant
visage
of
Magua
.
The
deep
guttural
laugh
of
*NL*
the
savage
sounded
,
at
such
a
moment
,
to
Duncan
,
like
the
hellish
taunt
*NL*
of
a
demon
.
Had
he
pursued
the
sudden
and
fierce
impulse
of
the
instant
,
*NL*
he
would
have
cast
himself
on
the
Huron
,
and
committed
their
fortunes
*NL*
to
the
issue
of
a
deadly
struggle
.
But
,
without
arms
of
any
description
,
*NL*
ignorant
of
what
succor
his
subtle
enemy
could
command
,
and
charged
with
*NL*
the
safety
of
one
who
was
just
then
dearer
than
ever
to
his
heart
,
he
no
*NL*
sooner
entertained
than
he
abandoned
the
desperate
intention
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
your
purpose
?
''
said
Alice
,
meekly
folding
her
arms
on
her
*NL*
bosom
,
and
struggling
to
conceal
an
agony
of
apprehension
in
behalf
of
*NL*
Heyward
,
in
the
usual
cold
and
distant
manner
with
which
she
received
*NL*
the
visits
of
her
captor
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
exulting
Indian
had
resumed
his
austere
countenance
,
though
he
drew
*NL*
warily
back
before
the
menacing
glance
of
the
young
man
's
fiery
eye
.
He
*NL*
regarded
both
his
captives
for
a
moment
with
a
steady
look
,
and
then
,
*NL*
stepping
aside
,
he
dropped
a
log
of
wood
across
a
door
different
from
*NL*
that
by
which
Duncan
had
entered
.
The
latter
now
comprehended
the
manner
*NL*
of
his
surprise
,
and
,
believing
himself
irretrievably
lost
,
he
drew
*NL*
Alice
to
his
bosom
,
and
stood
prepared
to
meet
a
fate
which
he
hardly
*NL*
regretted
,
since
it
was
to
be
suffered
in
such
company
.
But
Magua
*NL*
meditated
no
immediate
violence
.
His
first
measures
were
very
evidently
*NL*
taken
to
secure
his
new
captive
;
nor
did
he
even
bestow
a
second
glance
*NL*
at
the
motionless
forms
in
the
center
of
the
cavern
,
until
he
had
*NL*
completely
cut
off
every
hope
of
retreat
through
the
private
outlet
he
*NL*
had
himself
used
.
He
was
watched
in
all
his
movements
by
Heyward
,
who
,
*NL*
however
,
remained
firm
,
still
folding
the
fragile
form
of
Alice
to
his
*NL*
heart
,
at
once
too
proud
and
too
hopeless
to
ask
favor
of
an
enemy
*NL*
so
often
foiled
.
When
Magua
had
effected
his
object
he
approached
his
*NL*
prisoners
,
and
said
in
English
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
pale
faces
trap
the
cunning
beavers
;
but
the
red-skins
know
how
to
*NL*
take
the
Yengeese
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Huron
,
do
your
worst
!
''
exclaimed
the
excited
Heyward
,
forgetful
that
a
*NL*
double
stake
was
involved
in
his
life
;
``
you
and
your
vengeance
are
alike
*NL*
despised
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
the
white
man
speak
these
words
at
the
stake
?
''
asked
Magua
;
*NL*
manifesting
,
at
the
same
time
,
how
little
faith
he
had
in
the
other
's
*NL*
resolution
by
the
sneer
that
accompanied
his
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
;
singly
to
your
face
,
or
in
the
presence
of
your
nation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Le
Renard
Subtil
is
a
great
chief
!
''
returned
the
Indian
;
``
he
will
go
*NL*
and
bring
his
young
men
,
to
see
how
bravely
a
pale
face
can
laugh
at
*NL*
tortures
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
away
while
speaking
,
and
was
about
to
leave
the
place
through
*NL*
the
avenue
by
which
Duncan
had
approached
,
when
a
growl
caught
his
ear
,
*NL*
and
caused
him
to
hesitate
.
The
figure
of
the
bear
appeared
in
the
door
,
*NL*
where
it
sat
,
rolling
from
side
to
side
in
its
customary
restlessness
.
*NL*
Magua
,
like
the
father
of
the
sick
woman
,
eyed
it
keenly
for
a
moment
,
*NL*
as
if
to
ascertain
its
character
.
He
was
far
above
the
more
vulgar
*NL*
superstitions
of
his
tribe
,
and
so
soon
as
he
recognized
the
well-known
*NL*
attire
of
the
conjurer
,
he
prepared
to
pass
it
in
cool
contempt
.
But
*NL*
a
louder
and
more
threatening
growl
caused
him
again
to
pause
.
Then
he
*NL*
seemed
as
if
suddenly
resolved
to
trifle
no
longer
,
and
moved
resolutely
*NL*
forward
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
mimic
animal
,
which
had
advanced
a
little
,
retired
slowly
in
his
*NL*
front
,
until
it
arrived
again
at
the
pass
,
when
,
rearing
on
his
hinder
*NL*
legs
,
it
beat
the
air
with
its
paws
,
in
the
manner
practised
by
its
*NL*
brutal
prototype
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fool
!
''
exclaimed
the
chief
,
in
Huron
,
``
go
play
with
the
children
and
*NL*
squaws
;
leave
men
to
their
wisdom
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
once
more
endeavored
to
pass
the
supposed
empiric
,
scorning
even
the
*NL*
parade
of
threatening
to
use
the
knife
,
or
tomahawk
,
that
was
pendent
*NL*
from
his
belt
.
Suddenly
the
beast
extended
its
arms
,
or
rather
legs
,
and
*NL*
inclosed
him
in
a
grasp
that
might
have
vied
with
the
far-famed
power
of
*NL*
the
``
bear
's
hug
''
itself
.
Heyward
had
watched
the
whole
procedure
,
on
the
*NL*
part
of
Hawkeye
,
with
breathless
interest
.
At
first
he
relinquished
his
*NL*
hold
of
Alice
;
then
he
caught
up
a
thong
of
buckskin
,
which
had
been
*NL*
used
around
some
bundle
,
and
when
he
beheld
his
enemy
with
his
two
arms
*NL*
pinned
to
his
side
by
the
iron
muscles
of
the
scout
,
he
rushed
upon
him
,
*NL*
and
effectually
secured
them
there
.
Arms
,
legs
,
and
feet
were
encircled
*NL*
in
twenty
folds
of
the
thong
,
in
less
time
than
we
have
taken
to
record
*NL*
the
circumstance
.
When
the
formidable
Huron
was
completely
pinioned
,
the
*NL*
scout
released
his
hold
,
and
Duncan
laid
his
enemy
on
his
back
,
utterly
*NL*
helpless
.
*NL*
*NL*
Throughout
the
whole
of
this
sudden
and
extraordinary
operation
,
Magua
,
*NL*
though
he
had
struggled
violently
,
until
assured
he
was
in
the
hands
of
*NL*
one
whose
nerves
were
far
better
strung
than
his
own
,
had
not
uttered
*NL*
the
slightest
exclamation
.
But
when
Hawkeye
,
by
way
of
making
a
summary
*NL*
explanation
of
his
conduct
,
removed
the
shaggy
jaws
of
the
beast
,
and
*NL*
exposed
his
own
rugged
and
earnest
countenance
to
the
gaze
of
the
Huron
,
*NL*
the
philosophy
of
the
latter
was
so
far
mastered
as
to
permit
him
to
*NL*
utter
the
never
failing
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hugh
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
you
've
found
your
tongue
,
''
said
his
undisturbed
conqueror
;
``
now
,
*NL*
in
order
that
you
shall
not
use
it
to
our
ruin
,
I
must
make
free
to
stop
*NL*
your
mouth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
there
was
no
time
to
be
lost
,
the
scout
immediately
set
about
*NL*
effecting
so
necessary
a
precaution
;
and
when
he
had
gagged
the
Indian
,
*NL*
his
enemy
might
safely
have
been
considered
as
``
hors
de
combat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
what
place
did
the
imp
enter
?
''
asked
the
industrious
scout
,
when
his
*NL*
work
was
ended
.
``
Not
a
soul
has
passed
my
way
since
you
left
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Duncan
pointed
out
the
door
by
which
Magua
had
come
,
and
which
now
*NL*
presented
too
many
obstacles
to
a
quick
retreat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bring
on
the
gentle
one
,
then
,
''
continued
his
friend
;
``
we
must
make
a
*NL*
push
for
the
woods
by
the
other
outlet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
impossible
!
''
said
Duncan
;
``
fear
has
overcome
her
,
and
she
is
*NL*
helpless
.
Alice
!
my
sweet
,
my
own
Alice
,
arouse
yourself
;
now
is
the
*NL*
moment
to
fly
.
'T
is
in
vain
!
she
hears
,
but
is
unable
to
follow
.
Go
,
*NL*
noble
and
worthy
friend
;
save
yourself
,
and
leave
me
to
my
fate
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Every
trail
has
its
end
,
and
every
calamity
brings
its
lesson
!
''
*NL*
returned
the
scout
.
``
There
,
wrap
her
in
them
Indian
cloths
.
Conceal
all
*NL*
of
her
little
form
.
Nay
,
that
foot
has
no
fellow
in
the
wilderness
;
it
*NL*
will
betray
her
.
All
,
every
part
.
Now
take
her
in
your
arms
,
and
follow
.
*NL*
Leave
the
rest
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Duncan
,
as
may
be
gathered
from
the
words
of
his
companion
,
was
eagerly
*NL*
obeying
;
and
,
as
the
other
finished
speaking
,
he
took
the
light
person
*NL*
of
Alice
in
his
arms
,
and
followed
in
the
footsteps
of
the
scout
.
They
*NL*
found
the
sick
woman
as
they
had
left
her
,
still
alone
,
and
passed
*NL*
swiftly
on
,
by
the
natural
gallery
,
to
the
place
of
entrance
.
As
they
*NL*
approached
the
little
door
of
bark
,
a
murmur
of
voices
without
announced
*NL*
that
the
friends
and
relatives
of
the
invalid
were
gathered
about
the
*NL*
place
,
patiently
awaiting
a
summons
to
re-enter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
open
my
lips
to
speak
,
''
Hawkeye
whispered
,
``
my
English
,
which
is
*NL*
the
genuine
tongue
of
a
white-skin
,
will
tell
the
varlets
that
an
enemy
*NL*
is
among
them
.
You
must
give
'em
your
jargon
,
major
;
and
say
that
we
*NL*
have
shut
the
evil
spirit
in
the
cave
,
and
are
taking
the
woman
to
the
*NL*
woods
in
order
to
find
strengthening
roots
.
Practise
all
your
cunning
,
*NL*
for
it
is
a
lawful
undertaking
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
door
opened
a
little
,
as
if
one
without
was
listening
to
the
*NL*
proceedings
within
,
and
compelled
the
scout
to
cease
his
directions
.
A
*NL*
fierce
growl
repelled
the
eavesdropper
,
and
then
the
scout
boldly
threw
*NL*
open
the
covering
of
bark
,
and
left
the
place
,
enacting
the
character
of
*NL*
a
bear
as
he
proceeded
.
Duncan
kept
close
at
his
heels
,
and
soon
found
*NL*
himself
in
the
center
of
a
cluster
of
twenty
anxious
relatives
and
*NL*
friends
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
crowd
fell
back
a
little
,
and
permitted
the
father
,
and
one
who
*NL*
appeared
to
be
the
husband
of
the
woman
,
to
approach
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
my
brother
driven
away
the
evil
spirit
?
''
demanded
the
former
.
``
What
*NL*
has
he
in
his
arms
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thy
child
,
''
returned
Duncan
,
gravely
;
``
the
disease
has
gone
out
of
her
;
*NL*
it
is
shut
up
in
the
rocks
.
I
take
the
woman
to
a
distance
,
where
I
will
*NL*
strengthen
her
against
any
further
attacks
.
She
will
be
in
the
wigwam
of
*NL*
the
young
man
when
the
sun
comes
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
father
had
translated
the
meaning
of
the
stranger
's
words
into
*NL*
the
Huron
language
,
a
suppressed
murmur
announced
the
satisfaction
with
*NL*
which
this
intelligence
was
received
.
The
chief
himself
waved
his
hand
*NL*
for
Duncan
to
proceed
,
saying
aloud
,
in
a
firm
voice
,
and
with
a
lofty
*NL*
manner
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
;
I
am
a
man
,
and
I
will
enter
the
rock
and
fight
the
wicked
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Heyward
had
gladly
obeyed
,
and
was
already
past
the
little
group
,
when
*NL*
these
startling
words
arrested
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
my
brother
mad
?
''
he
exclaimed
;
``
is
he
cruel
?
He
will
meet
the
*NL*
disease
,
and
it
will
enter
him
;
or
he
will
drive
out
the
disease
,
and
*NL*
it
will
chase
his
daughter
into
the
woods
.
No
;
let
my
children
wait
*NL*
without
,
and
if
the
spirit
appears
beat
him
down
with
clubs
.
He
is
*NL*
cunning
,
and
will
bury
himself
in
the
mountain
,
when
he
sees
how
many
*NL*
are
ready
to
fight
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
singular
warning
had
the
desired
effect
.
Instead
of
entering
*NL*
the
cavern
,
the
father
and
husband
drew
their
tomahawks
,
and
posted
*NL*
themselves
in
readiness
to
deal
their
vengeance
on
the
imaginary
*NL*
tormentor
of
their
sick
relative
,
while
the
women
and
children
broke
*NL*
branches
from
the
bushes
,
or
seized
fragments
of
the
rock
,
with
a
*NL*
similar
intention
.
At
this
favorable
moment
the
counterfeit
conjurers
*NL*
disappeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hawkeye
,
at
the
same
time
that
he
had
presumed
so
far
on
the
nature
*NL*
of
the
Indian
superstitions
,
was
not
ignorant
that
they
were
rather
*NL*
tolerated
than
relied
on
by
the
wisest
of
the
chiefs
.
He
well
knew
the
*NL*
value
of
time
in
the
present
emergency
.
Whatever
might
be
the
extent
of
*NL*
the
self-delusion
of
his
enemies
,
and
however
it
had
tended
to
assist
*NL*
his
schemes
,
the
slightest
cause
of
suspicion
,
acting
on
the
subtle
*NL*
nature
of
an
Indian
,
would
be
likely
to
prove
fatal
.
Taking
the
path
,
*NL*
therefore
,
that
was
most
likely
to
avoid
observation
,
he
rather
skirted
*NL*
than
entered
the
village
.
The
warriors
were
still
to
be
seen
in
the
*NL*
distance
,
by
the
fading
light
of
the
fires
,
stalking
from
lodge
to
*NL*
lodge
.
But
the
children
had
abandoned
their
sports
for
their
beds
of
*NL*
skins
,
and
the
quiet
of
night
was
already
beginning
to
prevail
over
the
*NL*
turbulence
and
excitement
of
so
busy
and
important
an
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alice
revived
under
the
renovating
influence
of
the
open
air
,
and
,
*NL*
as
her
physical
rather
than
her
mental
powers
had
been
the
subject
of
*NL*
weakness
,
she
stood
in
no
need
of
any
explanation
of
that
which
had
*NL*
occurred
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
let
me
make
an
effort
to
walk
,
''
she
said
,
when
they
had
entered
the
*NL*
forest
,
blushing
,
though
unseen
,
that
she
had
not
been
sooner
able
to
*NL*
quit
the
arms
of
Duncan
;
``
I
am
indeed
restored
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
Alice
,
you
are
yet
too
weak
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
maiden
struggled
gently
to
release
herself
,
and
Heyward
was
*NL*
compelled
to
part
with
his
precious
burden
.
The
representative
of
the
*NL*
bear
had
certainly
been
an
entire
stranger
to
the
delicious
emotions
of
*NL*
the
lover
while
his
arms
encircled
his
mistress
;
and
he
was
,
perhaps
,
*NL*
a
stranger
also
to
the
nature
of
that
feeling
of
ingenuous
shame
that
*NL*
oppressed
the
trembling
Alice
.
But
when
he
found
himself
at
a
suitable
*NL*
distance
from
the
lodges
he
made
a
halt
,
and
spoke
on
a
subject
of
which
*NL*
he
was
thoroughly
the
master
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
path
will
lead
you
to
the
brook
,
''
he
said
;
``
follow
its
northern
*NL*
bank
until
you
come
to
a
fall
;
mount
the
hill
on
your
right
,
and
you
*NL*
will
see
the
fires
of
the
other
people
.
There
you
must
go
and
demand
*NL*
protection
;
if
they
are
true
Delawares
you
will
be
safe
.
A
distant
*NL*
flight
with
that
gentle
one
,
just
now
,
is
impossible
.
The
Hurons
would
*NL*
follow
up
our
trail
,
and
master
our
scalps
before
we
had
got
a
dozen
*NL*
miles
.
Go
,
and
Providence
be
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
!
''
demanded
Heyward
,
in
surprise
;
``
surely
we
part
not
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Hurons
hold
the
pride
of
the
Delawares
;
the
last
of
the
high
blood
*NL*
of
the
Mohicans
is
in
their
power
,
''
returned
the
scout
;
``
I
go
to
see
*NL*
what
can
be
done
in
his
favor
.
Had
they
mastered
your
scalp
,
major
,
a
*NL*
knave
should
have
fallen
for
every
hair
it
held
,
as
I
promised
;
but
if
*NL*
the
young
Sagamore
is
to
be
led
to
the
stake
,
the
Indians
shall
see
also
*NL*
how
a
man
without
a
cross
can
die
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Not
in
the
least
offended
with
the
decided
preference
that
the
sturdy
*NL*
woodsman
gave
to
one
who
might
,
in
some
degree
,
be
called
the
child
of
*NL*
his
adoption
,
Duncan
still
continued
to
urge
such
reasons
against
so
*NL*
desperate
an
effort
as
presented
themselves
.
He
was
aided
by
Alice
,
who
*NL*
mingled
her
entreaties
with
those
of
Heyward
that
he
would
abandon
a
*NL*
resolution
that
promised
so
much
danger
,
with
so
little
hope
of
success
.
*NL*
Their
eloquence
and
ingenuity
were
expended
in
vain
.
The
scout
heard
*NL*
them
attentively
,
but
impatiently
,
and
finally
closed
the
discussion
,
*NL*
by
answering
,
in
a
tone
that
instantly
silenced
Alice
,
while
it
told
*NL*
Heyward
how
fruitless
any
further
remonstrances
would
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
heard
,
''
he
said
,
``
that
there
is
a
feeling
in
youth
which
binds
*NL*
man
to
woman
closer
than
the
father
is
tied
to
the
son
.
It
may
be
so
.
*NL*
I
have
seldom
been
where
women
of
my
color
dwell
;
but
such
may
be
the
*NL*
gifts
of
nature
in
the
settlements
.
You
have
risked
life
,
and
all
that
*NL*
is
dear
to
you
,
to
bring
off
this
gentle
one
,
and
I
suppose
that
some
*NL*
such
disposition
is
at
the
bottom
of
it
all
.
As
for
me
,
I
taught
the
lad
*NL*
the
real
character
of
a
rifle
;
and
well
has
he
paid
me
for
it
.
I
have
*NL*
fou
'
t
at
his
side
in
many
a
bloody
scrimmage
;
and
so
long
as
I
could
*NL*
hear
the
crack
of
his
piece
in
one
ear
,
and
that
of
the
Sagamore
in
the
*NL*
other
,
I
knew
no
enemy
was
on
my
back
.
Winters
and
summer
,
nights
and
*NL*
days
,
have
we
roved
the
wilderness
in
company
,
eating
of
the
same
dish
,
*NL*
one
sleeping
while
the
other
watched
;
and
afore
it
shall
be
said
that
*NL*
Uncas
was
taken
to
the
torment
,
and
I
at
hand
--
There
is
but
a
single
*NL*
Ruler
of
us
all
,
whatever
may
the
color
of
the
skin
;
and
Him
I
call
*NL*
to
witness
,
that
before
the
Mohican
boy
shall
perish
for
the
want
of
*NL*
a
friend
,
good
faith
shall
depart
the
`
arth
,
and

become
as
*NL*
harmless
as
the
tooting
we

pon
of
the
singer
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Duncan
released
his
hold
on
the
arm
of
the
scout
,
who
turned
,
and
*NL*
steadily
retraced
his
steps
toward
the
lodges
.
After
pausing
a
moment
to
*NL*
gaze
at
his
retiring
form
,
the
successful
and
yet
sorrowful
Heyward
*NL*
and
Alice
took
their
way
together
toward
the
distant
village
of
the
*NL*
Delawares

CHAPTER
26
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bot
.
--
Let
me
play
the
lion
too
.
''
*NL*
--
Midsummer
Night
's
Dream
*NL*
*NL*
Notwithstanding
the
high
resolution
of
Hawkeye
he
fully
comprehended
all
*NL*
the
difficulties
and
danger
he
was
about
to
incur
.
In
his
return
to
*NL*
the
camp
,
his
acute
and
practised
intellects
were
intently
engaged
in
*NL*
devising
means
to
counteract
a
watchfulness
and
suspicion
on
the
part
*NL*
of
his
enemies
,
that
he
knew
were
,
in
no
degree
,
inferior
to
his
own
.
*NL*
Nothing
but
the
color
of
his
skin
had
saved
the
lives
of
Magua
and
the
*NL*
conjurer
,
who
would
have
been
the
first
victims
sacrificed
to
his
own
*NL*
security
,
had
not
the
scout
believed
such
an
act
,
however
congenial
it
*NL*
might
be
to
the
nature
of
an
Indian
,
utterly
unworthy
of
one
who
boasted
*NL*
a
descent
from
men
that
knew
no
cross
of
blood
.
Accordingly
,
he
trusted
*NL*
to
the
withes
and
ligaments
with
which
he
had
bound
his
captives
,
*NL*
and
pursued
his
way
directly
toward
the
center
of
the
lodges
.
As
he
*NL*
approached
the
buildings
,
his
steps
become
more
deliberate
,
and
his
*NL*
vigilant
eye
suffered
no
sign
,
whether
friendly
or
hostile
,
to
escape
*NL*
him
.
A
neglected
hut
was
a
little
in
advance
of
the
others
,
and
appeared
*NL*
as
if
it
had
been
deserted
when
half
completed
--
most
probably
on
account
*NL*
of
failing
in
some
of
the
more
important
requisites
;
such
as
wood
*NL*
or
water
.
A
faint
light
glimmered
through
its
cracks
,
however
,
and
*NL*
announced
that
,
notwithstanding
its
imperfect
structure
,
it
was
not
*NL*
without
a
tenant
.
Thither
,
then
,
the
scout
proceeded
,
like
a
prudent
*NL*
general
,
who
was
about
to
feel
the
advanced
positions
of
his
enemy
,
*NL*
before
he
hazarded
the
main
attack
.
*NL*
*NL*
Throwing
himself
into
a
suitable
posture
for
the
beast
he
represented
,
*NL*
Hawkeye
crawled
to
a
little
opening
,
where
he
might
command
a
view
of
*NL*
the
interior
.
It
proved
to
be
the
abiding
place
of
David
Gamut
.
Hither
*NL*
the
faithful
singing-master
had
now
brought
himself
,
together
with
*NL*
all
his
sorrows
,
his
apprehensions
,
and
his
meek
dependence
on
the
*NL*
protection
of
Providence
.
At
the
precise
moment
when
his
ungainly
person
*NL*
came
under
the
observation
of
the
scout
,
in
the
manner
just
mentioned
,
*NL*
the
woodsman
himself
,
though
in
his
assumed
character
,
was
the
subject
*NL*
of
the
solitary
being
's
profounded
reflections
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
implicit
the
faith
of
David
was
in
the
performance
of
ancient
*NL*
miracles
,
he
eschewed
the
belief
of
any
direct
supernatural
agency
in
*NL*
the
management
of
modern
morality
.
In
other
words
,
while
he
had
implicit
*NL*
faith
in
the
ability
of
Balaam
's
ass
to
speak
,
he
was
somewhat
skeptical
*NL*
on
the
subject
of
a
bear
's
singing
;
and
yet
he
had
been
assured
of
*NL*
the
latter
,
on
the
testimony
of
his
own
exquisite
organs
.
There
was
*NL*
something
in
his
air
and
manner
that
betrayed
to
the
scout
the
utter
*NL*
confusion
of
the
state
of
his
mind
.
He
was
seated
on
a
pile
of
brush
,
*NL*
a
few
twigs
from
which
occasionally
fed
his
low
fire
,
with
his
head
*NL*
leaning
on
his
arm
,
in
a
posture
of
melancholy
musing
.
The
costume
*NL*
of
the
votary
of
music
had
undergone
no
other
alteration
from
that
so
*NL*
lately
described
,
except
that
he
had
covered
his
bald
head
with
the
*NL*
triangular
beaver
,
which
had
not
proved
sufficiently
alluring
to
excite
*NL*
the
cupidity
of
any
of
his
captors
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
ingenious
Hawkeye
,
who
recalled
the
hasty
manner
in
which
the
other
*NL*
had
abandoned
his
post
at
the
bedside
of
the
sick
woman
,
was
not
without
*NL*
his
suspicions
concerning
the
subject
of
so
much
solemn
deliberation
.
*NL*
First
making
the
circuit
of
the
hut
,
and
ascertaining
that
it
stood
*NL*
quite
alone
,
and
that
the
character
of
its
inmate
was
likely
to
protect
*NL*
it
from
visitors
,
he
ventured
through
its
low
door
,
into
the
very
*NL*
presence
of
Gamut
.
The
position
of
the
latter
brought
the
fire
between
*NL*
them
;
and
when
Hawkeye
had
seated
himself
on
end
,
near
a
minute
elapsed
,
*NL*
during
which
the
two
remained
regarding
each
other
without
speaking
.
*NL*
The
suddenness
and
the
nature
of
the
surprise
had
nearly
proved
too
much
*NL*
for
--
we
will
not
say
the
philosophy
--
but
for
the
pitch
and
resolution
*NL*
of
David
.
He
fumbled
for
his
pitch-pipe
,
and
arose
with
a
confused
*NL*
intention
of
attempting
a
musical
exorcism
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dark
and
mysterious
monster
!
''
he
exclaimed
,
while
with
trembling
hands
*NL*
he
disposed
of
his
auxiliary
eyes
,
and
sought
his
never-failing
resource
*NL*
in
trouble
,
the
gifted
version
of
the
psalms
;
``
I
know
not
your
nature
*NL*
nor
intents
;
but
if
aught
you
meditate
against
the
person
and
rights
*NL*
of
one
of
the
humblest
servants
of
the
temple
,
listen
to
the
inspired
*NL*
language
of
the
youth
of
Israel
,
and
repent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
bear
shook
his
shaggy
sides
,
and
then
a
well-known
voice
replied
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Put
up
the
tooting
we
`
pon
,
and
teach
your
throat
modesty
.
Five
words
*NL*
of
plain
and
comprehendible
English
are
worth
just
now
an
hour
of
*NL*
squalling
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
art
thou
?
''
demanded
David
,
utterly
disqualified
to
pursue
his
*NL*
original
intention
,
and
nearly
gasping
for
breath
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
man
like
yourself
;
and
one
whose
blood
is
as
little
tainted
by
the
*NL*
cross
of
a
bear
,
or
an
Indian
,
as
your
own
.
Have
you
so
soon
forgotten
*NL*
from
whom
you
received
the
foolish
instrument
you
hold
in
your
hand
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
these
things
be
?
''
returned
David
,
breathing
more
freely
,
as
the
*NL*
truth
began
to
dawn
upon
him
.
``
I
have
found
many
marvels
during
my
*NL*
sojourn
with
the
heathen
,
but
surely
nothing
to
excel
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
come
,
''
returned
Hawkeye
,
uncasing
his
honest
countenance
,
the
*NL*
better
to
assure
the
wavering
confidence
of
his
companion
;
``
you
may
see
*NL*
a
skin
,
which
,
if
it
be
not
as
white
as
one
of
the
gentle
ones
,
has
no
*NL*
tinge
of
red
to
it
that
the
winds
of
the
heaven
and
the
sun
have
not
*NL*
bestowed
.
Now
let
us
to
business
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
First
tell
me
of
the
maiden
,
and
of
the
youth
who
so
bravely
sought
*NL*
her
,
''
interrupted
David
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
they
are
happily
freed
from
the
tomahawks
of
these
varlets
.
But
can
*NL*
you
put
me
on
the
scent
of
Uncas
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
young
man
is
in
bondage
,
and
much
I
fear
his
death
is
decreed
.
I
*NL*
greatly
mourn
that
one
so
well
disposed
should
die
in
his
ignorance
,
and
*NL*
I
have
sought
a
goodly
hymn
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
you
lead
me
to
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
task
will
not
be
difficult
,
''
returned
David
,
hesitating
;
``
though
*NL*
I
greatly
fear
your
presence
would
rather
increase
than
mitigate
his
*NL*
unhappy
fortunes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
more
words
,
but
lead
on
,
''
returned
Hawkeye
,
concealing
his
face
*NL*
again
,
and
setting
the
example
in
his
own
person
,
by
instantly
quitting
*NL*
the
lodge
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
proceeded
,
the
scout
ascertained
that
his
companion
found
access
*NL*
to
Uncas
,
under
privilege
of
his
imaginary
infirmity
,
aided
by
the
favor
*NL*
he
had
acquired
with
one
of
the
guards
,
who
,
in
consequence
of
speaking
*NL*
a
little
English
,
had
been
selected
by
David
as
the
subject
of
a
*NL*
religious
conversion
.
How
far
the
Huron
comprehended
the
intentions
of
*NL*
his
new
friend
may
well
be
doubted
;
but
as
exclusive
attention
is
*NL*
as
flattering
to
a
savage
as
to
a
more
civilized
individual
,
it
had
*NL*
produced
the
effect
we
have
mentioned
.
It
is
unnecessary
to
repeat
the
*NL*
shrewd
manner
with
which
the
scout
extracted
these
particulars
from
the
*NL*
simple
David
;
neither
shall
we
dwell
in
this
place
on
the
nature
of
the
*NL*
instruction
he
delivered
,
when
completely
master
of
all
the
necessary
*NL*
facts
;
as
the
whole
will
be
sufficiently
explained
to
the
reader
in
the
*NL*
course
of
the
narrative
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
lodge
in
which
Uncas
was
confined
was
in
the
very
center
of
the
*NL*
village
,
and
in
a
situation
,
perhaps
,
more
difficult
than
any
other
to
*NL*
approach
,
or
leave
,
without
observation
.
But
it
was
not
the
policy
of
*NL*
Hawkeye
to
affect
the
least
concealment
.
Presuming
on
his
disguise
,
and
*NL*
his
ability
to
sustain
the
character
he
had
assumed
,
he
took
the
most
*NL*
plain
and
direct
route
to
the
place
.
The
hour
,
however
,
afforded
him
*NL*
some
little
of
that
protection
which
he
appeared
so
much
to
despise
.
The
*NL*
boys
were
already
buried
in
sleep
,
and
all
the
women
,
and
most
of
the
*NL*
warriors
,
had
retired
to
their
lodges
for
the
night
.
Four
or
five
of
*NL*
the
latter
only
lingered
about
the
door
of
the
prison
of
Uncas
,
wary
but
*NL*
close
observers
of
the
manner
of
their
captive
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
sight
of
Gamut
,
accompanied
by
one
in
the
well-known
masquerade
*NL*
of
their
most
distinguished
conjurer
,
they
readily
made
way
for
them
*NL*
both
.
Still
they
betrayed
no
intention
to
depart
.
On
the
other
hand
,
*NL*
they
were
evidently
disposed
to
remain
bound
to
the
place
by
an
*NL*
additional
interest
in
the
mysterious
mummeries
that
they
of
course
*NL*
expected
from
such
a
visit
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
total
inability
of
the
scout
to
address
the
Hurons
in
their
own
*NL*
language
,
he
was
compelled
to
trust
the
conversation
entirely
to
David
.
*NL*
Notwithstanding
the
simplicity
of
the
latter
,
he
did
ample
justice
to
*NL*
the
instructions
he
had
received
,
more
than
fulfilling
the
strongest
*NL*
hopes
of
his
teacher
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Delawares
are
women
!
''
he
exclaimed
,
addressing
himself
to
the
*NL*
savage
who
had
a
slight
understanding
of
the
language
in
which
he
spoke
;
*NL*
``
the
Yengeese
,
my
foolish
countrymen
,
have
told
them
to
take
up
the
*NL*
tomahawk
,
and
strike
their
fathers
in
the
Canadas
,
and
they
have
*NL*
forgotten
their
sex
.
Does
my
brother
wish
to
hear
`
Le
Cerf
Agile
'
ask
*NL*
for
his
petticoats
,
and
see
him
weep
before
the
Hurons
,
at
the
stake
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
exclamation
``
Hugh
!
''
delivered
in
a
strong
tone
of
assent
,
announced
*NL*
the
gratification
the
savage
would
receive
in
witnessing
such
an
*NL*
exhibition
of
weakness
in
an
enemy
so
long
hated
and
so
much
feared
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
let
him
step
aside
,
and
the
cunning
man
will
blow
upon
the
dog
.
*NL*
Tell
it
to
my
brothers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Huron
explained
the
meaning
of
David
to
his
fellows
,
who
,
in
their
*NL*
turn
,
listened
to
the
project
with
that
sort
of
satisfaction
that
*NL*
their
untamed
spirits
might
be
expected
to
find
in
such
a
refinement
in
*NL*
cruelty
.
They
drew
back
a
little
from
the
entrance
and
motioned
to
the
*NL*
supposed
conjurer
to
enter
.
But
the
bear
,
instead
of
obeying
,
maintained
*NL*
the
seat
it
had
taken
,
and
growled
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
cunning
man
is
afraid
that
his
breath
will
blow
upon
his
brothers
,
*NL*
and
take
away
their
courage
too
,
''
continued
David
,
improving
the
hint
he
*NL*
received
;
``
they
must
stand
further
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Hurons
,
who
would
have
deemed
such
a
misfortune
the
heaviest
*NL*
calamity
that
could
befall
them
,
fell
back
in
a
body
,
taking
a
position
*NL*
where
they
were
out
of
earshot
,
though
at
the
same
time
they
could
*NL*
command
a
view
of
the
entrance
to
the
lodge
.
Then
,
as
if
satisfied
of
*NL*
their
safety
,
the
scout
left
his
position
,
and
slowly
entered
the
place
.
*NL*
It
was
silent
and
gloomy
,
being
tenanted
solely
by
the
captive
,
and
*NL*
lighted
by
the
dying
embers
of
a
fire
,
which
had
been
used
for
the
*NL*
purposed
of
cookery
.
*NL*
*NL*
Uncas
occupied
a
distant
corner
,
in
a
reclining
attitude
,
being
rigidly
*NL*
bound
,
both
hands
and
feet
,
by
strong
and
painful
withes
.
When
the
*NL*
frightful
object
first
presented
itself
to
the
young
Mohican
,
he
did
not
*NL*
deign
to
bestow
a
single
glance
on
the
animal
.
The
scout
,
who
had
left
*NL*
David
at
the
door
,
to
ascertain
they
were
not
observed
,
thought
it
*NL*
prudent
to
preserve
his
disguise
until
assured
of
their
privacy
.
Instead
*NL*
of
speaking
,
therefore
,
he
exerted
himself
to
enact
one
of
the
antics
of
*NL*
the
animal
he
represented
.
The
young
Mohican
,
who
at
first
believed
his
*NL*
enemies
had
sent
in
a
real
beast
to
torment
him
,
and
try
his
nerves
,
*NL*
detected
in
those
performances
that
to
Heyward
had
appeared
so
accurate
,
*NL*
certain
blemishes
,
that
at
once
betrayed
the
counterfeit
.
Had
Hawkeye
*NL*
been
aware
of
the
low
estimation
in
which
the
skillful
Uncas
held
his
*NL*
representations
,
he
would
probably
have
prolonged
the
entertainment
*NL*
a
little
in
pique
.
But
the
scornful
expression
of
the
young
man
's
eye
*NL*
admitted
of
so
many
constructions
,
that
the
worthy
scout
was
spared
the
*NL*
mortification
of
such
a
discovery
.
As
soon
,
therefore
,
as
David
gave
the
*NL*
preconcerted
signal
,
a
low
hissing
sound
was
heard
in
the
lodge
in
place
*NL*
of
the
fierce
growlings
of
the
bear
.
*NL*
*NL*
Uncas
had
cast
his
body
back
against
the
wall
of
the
hut
and
closed
*NL*
his
eyes
,
as
if
willing
to
exclude
so
contemptible
and
disagreeable
*NL*
an
object
from
his
sight
.
But
the
moment
the
noise
of
the
serpent
was
*NL*
heard
,
he
arose
,
and
cast
his
looks
on
each
side
of
him
,
bending
his
*NL*
head
low
,
and
turning
it
inquiringly
in
every
direction
,
until
his
keen
*NL*
eye
rested
on
the
shaggy
monster
,
where
it
remained
riveted
,
as
though
*NL*
fixed
by
the
power
of
a
charm
.
Again
the
same
sounds
were
repeated
,
*NL*
evidently
proceeding
from
the
mouth
of
the
beast
.
Once
more
the
eyes
of
*NL*
the
youth
roamed
over
the
interior
of
the
lodge
,
and
returning
to
the
*NL*
former
resting
place
,
he
uttered
,
in
a
deep
,
suppressed
voice
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hawkeye
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cut
his
bands
,
''
said
Hawkeye
to
David
,
who
just
then
approached
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
singer
did
as
he
was
ordered
,
and
Uncas
found
his
limbs
released
.
At
*NL*
the
same
moment
the
dried
skin
of
the
animal
rattled
,
and
presently
*NL*
the
scout
arose
to
his
feet
,
in
proper
person
.
The
Mohican
appeared
to
*NL*
comprehend
the
nature
of
the
attempt
his
friend
had
made
,
intuitively
,
*NL*
neither
tongue
nor
feature
betraying
another
symptom
of
surprise
.
When
*NL*
Hawkeye
had
cast
his
shaggy
vestment
,
which
was
done
by
simply
loosing
*NL*
certain
thongs
of
skin
,
he
drew
a
long
,
glittering
knife
,
and
put
it
in
*NL*
the
hands
of
Uncas
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
red
Hurons
are
without
,
''
he
said
;
``
let
us
be
ready
.
''
At
the
same
*NL*
time
he
laid
his
finger
significantly
on
another
similar
weapon
,
both
*NL*
being
the
fruits
of
his
prowess
among
their
enemies
during
the
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
will
go
,
''
said
Uncas
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whither
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
the
Tortoises
;
they
are
the
children
of
my
grandfathers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
lad
,
''
said
the
scout
in
English
--
a
language
he
was
apt
to
use
*NL*
when
a
little
abstracted
in
mind
;
``
the
same
blood
runs
in
your
veins
,
*NL*
I
believe
;
but
time
and
distance
has
a
little
changed
its
color
.
What
*NL*
shall
we
do
with
the
Mingoes
at
the
door
?
They
count
six
,
and
this
*NL*
singer
is
as
good
as
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Hurons
are
boasters
,
''
said
Uncas
,
scornfully
;
``
their
`
totem
'
is
*NL*
a
moose
,
and
they
run
like
snails
.
The
Delawares
are
children
of
the
*NL*
tortoise
,
and
they
outstrip
the
deer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
lad
,
there
is
truth
in
what
you
say
;
and
I
doubt
not
,
on
a
rush
,
*NL*
you
would
pass
the
whole
nation
;
and
,
in
a
straight
race
of
two
miles
,
*NL*
would
be
in
,
and
get
your
breath
again
,
afore
a
knave
of
them
all
was
*NL*
within
hearing
of
the
other
village
.
But
the
gift
of
a
white
man
lies
*NL*
more
in
his
arms
than
in
his
legs
.
As
for
myself
,
I
can
brain
a
Huron
as
*NL*
well
as
a
better
man
;
but
when
it
comes
to
a
race
the
knaves
would
prove
*NL*
too
much
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Uncas
,
who
had
already
approached
the
door
,
in
readiness
to
lead
the
*NL*
way
,
now
recoiled
,
and
placed
himself
,
once
more
,
in
the
bottom
of
the
*NL*
lodge
.
But
Hawkeye
,
who
was
too
much
occupied
with
his
own
thoughts
*NL*
to
note
the
movement
,
continued
speaking
more
to
himself
than
to
his
*NL*
companion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
After
all
,
''
he
said
,
``
it
is
unreasonable
to
keep
one
man
in
bondage
to
*NL*
the
gifts
of
another
.
So
,
Uncas
,
you
had
better
take
the
lead
,
while
I
*NL*
will
put
on
the
skin
again
,
and
trust
to
cunning
for
want
of
speed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
Mohican
made
no
reply
,
but
quietly
folded
his
arms
,
and
leaned
*NL*
his
body
against
one
of
the
upright
posts
that
supported
the
wall
of
the
*NL*
hut
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
the
scout
looking
up
at
him
,
``
why
do
you
tarry
?
There
will
*NL*
be
time
enough
for
me
,
as
the
knaves
will
give
chase
to
you
at
first
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Uncas
will
stay
,
''
was
the
calm
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
fight
with
his
father
's
brother
,
and
die
with
the
friend
of
the
*NL*
Delawares
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
lad
,
''
returned
Hawkeye
,
squeezing
the
hand
of
Uncas
between
his
own
*NL*
iron
fingers
;
''
`
twould
have
been
more
like
a
Mingo
than
a
Mohican
had
*NL*
you
left
me
.
But
I
thought
I
would
make
the
offer
,
seeing
that
youth
*NL*
commonly
loves
life
.
Well
,
what
ca
n't
be
done
by
main
courage
,
in
war
,
*NL*
must
be
done
by
circumvention
.
Put
on
the
skin
;
I
doubt
not
you
can
play
*NL*
the
bear
nearly
as
well
as
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Whatever
might
have
been
the
private
opinion
of
Uncas
of
their
*NL*
respective
abilities
in
this
particular
,
his
grave
countenance
*NL*
manifested
no
opinion
of
his
superiority
.
He
silently
and
expeditiously
*NL*
encased
himself
in
the
covering
of
the
beast
,
and
then
awaited
such
*NL*
other
movements
as
his
more
aged
companion
saw
fit
to
dictate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
friend
,
''
said
Hawkeye
,
addressing
David
,
``
an
exchange
of
garments
*NL*
will
be
a
great
convenience
to
you
,
inasmuch
as
you
are
but
little
*NL*
accustomed
to
the
make-shifts
of
the
wilderness
.
Here
,
take
my
hunting
*NL*
shirt
and
cap
,
and
give
me
your
blanket
and
hat
.
You
must
trust
me
with
*NL*
the
book
and
spectacles
,
as
well
as
the
tooter
,
too
;
if
we
ever
meet
*NL*
again
,
in
better
times
,
you
shall
have
all
back
again
,
with
many
thanks
*NL*
into
the
bargain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
David
parted
with
the
several
articles
named
with
a
readiness
that
would
*NL*
have
done
great
credit
to
his
liberality
,
had
he
not
certainly
profited
,
*NL*
in
many
particulars
,
by
the
exchange
.
Hawkeye
was
not
long
in
assuming
*NL*
his
borrowed
garments
;
and
when
his
restless
eyes
were
hid
behind
the
*NL*
glasses
,
and
his
head
was
surmounted
by
the
triangular
beaver
,
as
their
*NL*
statures
were
not
dissimilar
,
he
might
readily
have
passed
for
the
*NL*
singer
,
by
starlight
.
As
soon
as
these
dispositions
were
made
,
the
scout
*NL*
turned
to
David
,
and
gave
him
his
parting
instructions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
much
given
to
cowardice
?
''
he
bluntly
asked
,
by
way
of
obtaining
*NL*
a
suitable
understanding
of
the
whole
case
before
he
ventured
a
*NL*
prescription
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
pursuits
are
peaceful
,
and
my
temper
,
I
humbly
trust
,
is
greatly
*NL*
given
to
mercy
and
love
,
''
returned
David
,
a
little
nettled
at
so
direct
*NL*
an
attack
on
his
manhood
;
``
but
there
are
none
who
can
say
that
I
have
*NL*
ever
forgotten
my
faith
in
the
Lord
,
even
in
the
greatest
straits
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
chiefest
danger
will
be
at
the
moment
when
the
savages
find
out
*NL*
that
they
have
been
deceived
.
If
you
are
not
then
knocked
on
the
head
,
*NL*
your
being
a
non-composser
will
protect
you
;
and
you
'll
then
have
a
good
*NL*
reason
to
expect
to
die
in
your
bed
.
If
you
stay
,
it
must
be
to
sit
down
*NL*
here
in
the
shadow
,
and
take
the
part
of
Uncas
,
until
such
times
as
the
*NL*
cunning
of
the
Indians
discover
the
cheat
,
when
,
as
I
have
already
said
,
*NL*
your
times
of
trial
will
come
.
So
choose
for
yourself
--
to
make
a
rush
or
*NL*
tarry
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Even
so
,
''
said
David
,
firmly
;
``
I
will
abide
in
the
place
of
the
*NL*
Delaware
.
Bravely
and
generously
has
he
battled
in
my
behalf
,
and
this
,
*NL*
and
more
,
will
I
dare
in
his
service
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
spoken
as
a
man
,
and
like
one
who
,
under
wiser
schooling
,
*NL*
would
have
been
brought
to
better
things
.
Hold
your
head
down
,
and
*NL*
draw
in
your
legs
;
their
formation
might
tell
the
truth
too
early
.
Keep
*NL*
silent
as
long
as
may
be
;
and
it
would
be
wise
,
when
you
do
speak
,
to
*NL*
break
out
suddenly
in
one
of
your
shoutings
,
which
will
serve
to
remind
*NL*
the
Indians
that
you
are
not
altogether
as
responsible
as
men
should
be
.
*NL*
If
however
,
they
take
your
scalp
,
as
I
trust
and
believe
they
will
not
,
*NL*
depend
on
it
,
Uncas
and
I
will
not
forget
the
deed
,
but
revenge
it
as
*NL*
becomes
true
warriors
and
trusty
friends
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hold
!
''
said
David
,
perceiving
that
with
this
assurance
they
were
about
*NL*
to
leave
him
;
``
I
am
an
unworthy
and
humble
follower
of
one
who
taught
*NL*
not
the
damnable
principle
of
revenge
.
Should
I
fall
,
therefore
,
seek
*NL*
no
victims
to
my
manes
,
but
rather
forgive
my
destroyers
;
and
if
you
*NL*
remember
them
at
all
,
let
it
be
in
prayers
for
the
enlightening
of
their
*NL*
minds
,
and
for
their
eternal
welfare
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
scout
hesitated
,
and
appeared
to
muse
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
a
principle
in
that
,
''
he
said
,
``
different
from
the
law
of
the
*NL*
woods
;
and
yet
it
is
fair
and
noble
to
reflect
upon
.
''
Then
heaving
*NL*
a
heavy
sigh
,
probably
among
the
last
he
ever
drew
in
pining
for
a
*NL*
condition
he
had
so
long
abandoned
,
he
added
:
``
it
is
what
I
would
wish
*NL*
to
practise
myself
,
as
one
without
a
cross
of
blood
,
though
it
is
not
*NL*
always
easy
to
deal
with
an
Indian
as
you
would
with
a
fellow
Christian
.
*NL*
God
bless
you
,
friend
;
I
do
believe
your
scent
is
not
greatly
wrong
,
*NL*
when
the
matter
is
duly
considered
,
and
keeping
eternity
before
the
*NL*
eyes
,
though
much
depends
on
the
natural
gifts
,
and
the
force
of
*NL*
temptation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
saying
,
the
scout
returned
and
shook
David
cordially
by
the
hand
;
*NL*
after
which
act
of
friendship
he
immediately
left
the
lodge
,
attended
by
*NL*
the
new
representative
of
the
beast
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
instant
Hawkeye
found
himself
under
the
observation
of
the
Hurons
,
*NL*
he
drew
up
his
tall
form
in
the
rigid
manner
of
David
,
threw
out
his
*NL*
arm
in
the
act
of
keeping
time
,
and
commenced
what
he
intended
for
an
*NL*
imitation
of
his
psalmody
.
Happily
for
the
success
of
this
delicate
*NL*
adventure
,
he
had
to
deal
with
ears
but
little
practised
in
the
concord
*NL*
of
sweet
sounds
,
or
the
miserable
effort
would
infallibly
have
been
*NL*
detected
.
It
was
necessary
to
pass
within
a
dangerous
proximity
of
the
*NL*
dark
group
of
the
savages
,
and
the
voice
of
the
scout
grew
louder
as
*NL*
they
drew
nigher
.
When
at
the
nearest
point
the
Huron
who
spoke
the
*NL*
English
thrust
out
an
arm
,
and
stopped
the
supposed
singing-master
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Delaware
dog
!
''
he
said
,
leaning
forward
,
and
peering
through
*NL*
the
dim
light
to
catch
the
expression
of
the
other
's
features
;
``
is
he
*NL*
afraid
?
Will
the
Hurons
hear
his
groans
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
growl
,
so
exceedingly
fierce
and
natural
,
proceeded
from
the
beast
,
*NL*
that
the
young
Indian
released
his
hold
and
started
aside
,
as
if
to
*NL*
assure
himself
that
it
was
not
a
veritable
bear
,
and
no
counterfeit
,
*NL*
that
was
rolling
before
him
.
Hawkeye
,
who
feared
his
voice
would
betray
*NL*
him
to
his
subtle
enemies
,
gladly
profited
by
the
interruption
,
to
break
*NL*
out
anew
in
such
a
burst
of
musical
expression
as
would
,
probably
,
in
*NL*
a
more
refined
state
of
society
have
been
termed
``
a
grand
crash
.
''
Among
*NL*
his
actual
auditors
,
however
,
it
merely
gave
him
an
additional
claim
to
*NL*
that
respect
which
they
never
withhold
from
such
as
are
believed
to
be
*NL*
the
subjects
of
mental
alienation
.
The
little
knot
of
Indians
drew
back
*NL*
in
a
body
,
and
suffered
,
as
they
thought
,
the
conjurer
and
his
inspired
*NL*
assistant
to
proceed
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
required
no
common
exercise
of
fortitude
in
Uncas
and
the
scout
to
*NL*
continue
the
dignified
and
deliberate
pace
they
had
assumed
in
passing
*NL*
the
lodge
;
especially
as
they
immediately
perceived
that
curiosity
had
*NL*
so
far
mastered
fear
,
as
to
induce
the
watchers
to
approach
the
hut
,
in
*NL*
order
to
witness
the
effect
of
the
incantations
.
The
least
injudicious
*NL*
or
impatient
movement
on
the
part
of
David
might
betray
them
,
and
time
*NL*
was
absolutely
necessary
to
insure
the
safety
of
the
scout
.
The
loud
*NL*
noise
the
latter
conceived
it
politic
to
continue
,
drew
many
curious
*NL*
gazers
to
the
doors
of
the
different
huts
as
thy
passed
;
and
once
or
*NL*
twice
a
dark-looking
warrior
stepped
across
their
path
,
led
to
the
act
*NL*
by
superstition
and
watchfulness
.
They
were
not
,
however
,
interrupted
,
*NL*
the
darkness
of
the
hour
,
and
the
boldness
of
the
attempt
,
proving
their
*NL*
principal
friends
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
adventurers
had
got
clear
of
the
village
,
and
were
now
swiftly
*NL*
approaching
the
shelter
of
the
woods
,
when
a
loud
and
long
cry
arose
*NL*
from
the
lodge
where
Uncas
had
been
confined
.
The
Mohican
started
on
*NL*
his
feet
,
and
shook
his
shaggy
covering
,
as
though
the
animal
he
*NL*
counterfeited
was
about
to
make
some
desperate
effort
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hold
!
''
said
the
scout
,
grasping
his
friend
by
the
shoulder
,
``
let
them
*NL*
yell
again
!
'T
was
nothing
but
wonderment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
no
occasion
to
delay
,
for
at
the
next
instant
a
burst
of
cries
*NL*
filled
the
outer
air
,
and
ran
along
the
whole
extent
of
the
village
.
*NL*
Uncas
cast
his
skin
,
and
stepped
forth
in
his
own
beautiful
proportions
.
*NL*
Hawkeye
tapped
him
lightly
on
the
shoulder
,
and
glided
ahead
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
let
the
devils
strike
our
scent
!
''
said
the
scout
,
tearing
two
*NL*
rifles
,
with
all
their
attendant
accouterments
,
from
beneath
a
bush
,
and
*NL*
flourishing
``
killdeer
''
as
he
handed
Uncas
his
weapon
;
``
two
,
at
least
,
*NL*
will
find
it
to
their
deaths
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
throwing
their
pieces
to
a
low
trail
,
like
sportsmen
in
readiness
*NL*
for
their
game
,
they
dashed
forward
,
and
were
soon
buried
in
the
somber
*NL*
darkness
of
the
forest
.

Julius
Caesar
*NL*
*NL*
The
impatience
of
the
savages
who
lingered
about
the
prison
of
Uncas
,
as
*NL*
has
been
seen
,
had
overcome
their
dread
of
the
conjurer
's
breath
.
They
*NL*
stole
cautiously
,
and
with
beating
hearts
,
to
a
crevice
,
through
which
*NL*
the
faint
light
of
the
fire
was
glimmering
.
For
several
minutes
they
*NL*
mistook
the
form
of
David
for
that
of
the
prisoner
;
but
the
very
*NL*
accident
which
Hawkeye
had
foreseen
occurred
.
Tired
of
keeping
the
*NL*
extremities
of
his
long
person
so
near
together
,
the
singer
gradually
*NL*
suffered
the
lower
limbs
to
extend
themselves
,
until
one
of
his
*NL*
misshapen
feet
actually
came
in
contact
with
and
shoved
aside
the
embers
*NL*
of
the
fire
.
At
first
the
Hurons
believed
the
Delaware
had
been
thus
*NL*
deformed
by
witchcraft
.
But
when
David
,
unconscious
of
being
observed
,
*NL*
turned
his
head
,
and
exposed
his
simple
,
mild
countenance
,
in
place
of
*NL*
the
haughty
lineaments
of
their
prisoner
,
it
would
have
exceeded
the
*NL*
credulity
of
even
a
native
to
have
doubted
any
longer
.
They
rushed
*NL*
together
into
the
lodge
,
and
,
laying
their
hands
,
with
but
little
*NL*
ceremony
,
on
their
captive
,
immediately
detected
the
imposition
.
Then
*NL*
arose
the
cry
first
heard
by
the
fugitives
.
It
was
succeeded
by
the
most
*NL*
frantic
and
angry
demonstrations
of
vengeance
.
David
,
however
,
firm
in
*NL*
his
determination
to
cover
the
retreat
of
his
friends
,
was
compelled
to
*NL*
believe
that
his
own
final
hour
had
come
.
Deprived
of
his
book
and
his
*NL*
pipe
,
he
was
fain
to
trust
to
a
memory
that
rarely
failed
him
on
such
*NL*
subjects
;
and
breaking
forth
in
a
loud
and
impassioned
strain
,
he
*NL*
endeavored
to
smooth
his
passage
into
the
other
world
by
singing
the
*NL*
opening
verse
of
a
funeral
anthem
.
The
Indians
were
seasonably
reminded
*NL*
of
his
infirmity
,
and
,
rushing
into
the
open
air
,
they
aroused
the
*NL*
village
in
the
manner
described
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
native
warrior
fights
as
he
sleeps
,
without
the
protection
of
anything
*NL*
defensive
.
The
sounds
of
the
alarm
were
,
therefore
,
hardly
uttered
*NL*
before
two
hundred
men
were
afoot
,
and
ready
for
the
battle
or
the
*NL*
chase
,
as
either
might
be
required
.
The
escape
was
soon
known
;
and
the
*NL*
whole
tribe
crowded
,
in
a
body
,
around
the
council-lodge
,
impatiently
*NL*
awaiting
the
instruction
of
their
chiefs
.
In
such
a
sudden
demand
on
*NL*
their
wisdom
,
the
presence
of
the
cunning
Magua
could
scarcely
fail
of
*NL*
being
needed
.
His
name
was
mentioned
,
and
all
looked
round
in
wonder
*NL*
that
he
did
not
appear
.
Messengers
were
then
despatched
to
his
lodge
*NL*
requiring
his
presence
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
,
some
of
the
swiftest
and
most
discreet
of
the
young
*NL*
men
were
ordered
to
make
the
circuit
of
the
clearing
,
under
cover
of
*NL*
the
woods
,
in
order
to
ascertain
that
their
suspected
neighbors
,
the
*NL*
Delawares
,
designed
no
mischief
.
Women
and
children
ran
to
and
fro
;
*NL*
and
,
in
short
,
the
whole
encampment
exhibited
another
scene
of
wild
*NL*
and
savage
confusion
.
Gradually
,
however
,
these
symptoms
of
disorder
*NL*
diminished
;
and
in
a
few
minutes
the
oldest
and
most
distinguished
*NL*
chiefs
were
assembled
in
the
lodge
,
in
grave
consultation
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
clamor
of
many
voices
soon
announced
that
a
party
approached
,
who
*NL*
might
be
expected
to
communicate
some
intelligence
that
would
explain
*NL*
the
mystery
of
the
novel
surprise
.
The
crowd
without
gave
way
,
and
*NL*
several
warriors
entered
the
place
,
bringing
with
them
the
hapless
*NL*
conjurer
,
who
had
been
left
so
long
by
the
scout
in
duress
.
*NL*
*NL*
Notwithstanding
this
man
was
held
in
very
unequal
estimation
among
the
*NL*
Hurons
,
some
believing
implicitly
in
his
power
,
and
others
deeming
him
*NL*
an
impostor
,
he
was
now
listened
to
by
all
with
the
deepest
attention
.
*NL*
When
his
brief
story
was
ended
,
the
father
of
the
sick
woman
stepped
*NL*
forth
,
and
,
in
a
few
pithy
expression
,
related
,
in
his
turn
,
what
he
*NL*
knew
.
These
two
narratives
gave
a
proper
direction
to
the
subsequent
*NL*
inquiries
,
which
were
now
made
with
the
characteristic
cunning
of
*NL*
savages
.
*NL*
*NL*
Instead
of
rushing
in
a
confused
and
disorderly
throng
to
the
cavern
,
*NL*
ten
of
the
wisest
and
firmest
among
the
chiefs
were
selected
to
*NL*
prosecute
the
investigation
.
As
no
time
was
to
be
lost
,
the
instant
the
*NL*
choice
was
made
the
individuals
appointed
rose
in
a
body
and
left
the
*NL*
place
without
speaking
.
On
reaching
the
entrance
,
the
younger
men
in
*NL*
advance
made
way
for
their
seniors
;
and
the
whole
proceeded
along
*NL*
the
low
,
dark
gallery
,
with
the
firmness
of
warriors
ready
to
devote
*NL*
themselves
to
the
public
good
,
though
,
at
the
same
time
,
secretly
*NL*
doubting
the
nature
of
the
power
with
which
they
were
about
to
contend
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
outer
apartment
of
the
cavern
was
silent
and
gloomy
.
The
woman
lay
*NL*
in
her
usual
place
and
posture
,
though
there
were
those
present
who
*NL*
affirmed
they
had
seen
her
borne
to
the
woods
by
the
supposed
``
medicine
*NL*
of
the
white
men
.
''
Such
a
direct
and
palpable
contradiction
of
the
tale
*NL*
related
by
the
father
caused
all
eyes
to
be
turned
on
him
.
Chafed
by
*NL*
the
silent
imputation
,
and
inwardly
troubled
by
so
unaccountable
a
*NL*
circumstance
,
the
chief
advanced
to
the
side
of
the
bed
,
and
,
stooping
,
*NL*
cast
an
incredulous
look
at
the
features
,
as
if
distrusting
their
*NL*
reality
.
His
daughter
was
dead
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
unerring
feeling
of
nature
for
a
moment
prevailed
and
the
old
*NL*
warrior
hid
his
eyes
in
sorrow
.
Then
,
recovering
his
self-possession
,
he
*NL*
faced
his
companions
,
and
,
pointing
toward
the
corpse
,
he
said
,
in
the
*NL*
language
of
his
people
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
wife
of
my
young
man
has
left
us
!
The
Great
Spirit
is
angry
with
*NL*
his
children
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
mournful
intelligence
was
received
in
solemn
silence
.
After
a
short
*NL*
pause
,
one
of
the
elder
Indians
was
about
to
speak
,
when
a
dark-looking
*NL*
object
was
seen
rolling
out
of
an
adjoining
apartment
,
into
the
very
*NL*
center
of
the
room
where
they
stood
.
Ignorant
of
the
nature
of
the
*NL*
beings
they
had
to
deal
with
,
the
whole
party
drew
back
a
little
,
and
,
*NL*
rising
on
end
,
exhibited
the
distorted
but
still
fierce
and
sullen
*NL*
features
of
Magua
.
The
discovery
was
succeeded
by
a
general
exclamation
*NL*
of
amazement
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
,
however
,
as
the
true
situation
of
the
chief
was
understood
,
*NL*
several
knives
appeared
,
and
his
limbs
and
tongue
were
quickly
released
.
*NL*
The
Huron
arose
,
and
shook
himself
like
a
lion
quitting
his
lair
.
Not
a
*NL*
word
escaped
him
,
though
his
hand
played
convulsively
with
the
handle
of
*NL*
his
knife
,
while
his
lowering
eyes
scanned
the
whole
party
,
as
if
they
*NL*
sought
an
object
suited
to
the
first
burst
of
his
vengeance
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
happy
for
Uncas
and
the
scout
,
and
even
David
,
that
they
were
*NL*
all
beyond
the
reach
of
his
arm
at
such
a
moment
;
for
,
assuredly
,
*NL*
no
refinement
in
cruelty
would
then
have
deferred
their
deaths
,
in
*NL*
opposition
to
the
promptings
of
the
fierce
temper
that
nearly
choked
*NL*
him
.
Meeting
everywhere
faces
that
he
knew
as
friends
,
the
savage
grated
*NL*
his
teeth
together
like
rasps
of
iron
,
and
swallowed
his
passion
for
*NL*
want
of
a
victim
on
whom
to
vent
it
.
This
exhibition
of
anger
was
noted
*NL*
by
all
present
;
and
from
an
apprehension
of
exasperating
a
temper
that
*NL*
was
already
chafed
nearly
to
madness
,
several
minutes
were
suffered
to
*NL*
pass
before
another
word
was
uttered
.
When
,
however
,
suitable
time
had
*NL*
elapsed
,
the
oldest
of
the
party
spoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
friend
has
found
an
enemy
,
''
he
said
.
``
Is
he
nigh
that
the
Hurons
*NL*
might
take
revenge
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
the
Delaware
die
!
''
exclaimed
Magua
,
in
a
voice
of
thunder
.
*NL*
*NL*
Another
longer
and
expressive
silence
was
observed
,
and
was
broken
,
as
*NL*
before
,
with
due
precaution
,
by
the
same
individual
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Mohican
is
swift
of
foot
,
and
leaps
far
,
''
he
said
;
``
but
my
young
*NL*
men
are
on
his
trail
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
he
gone
?
''
demanded
Magua
,
in
tones
so
deep
and
guttural
,
that
they
*NL*
seemed
to
proceed
from
his
inmost
chest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
evil
spirit
has
been
among
us
,
and
the
Delaware
has
blinded
our
*NL*
eyes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
evil
spirit
!
''
repeated
the
other
,
mockingly
;
''
't
is
the
spirit
that
*NL*
has
taken
the
lives
of
so
many
Hurons
;
the
spirit
that
slew
my
young
men
*NL*
at
`
the
tumbling
river
'
;
that
took
their
scalps
at
the
`
healing
spring
'
;
*NL*
and
who
has
,
now
,
bound
the
arms
of
Le
Renard
Subtil
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
whom
does
my
friend
speak
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
the
dog
who
carries
the
heart
and
cunning
of
a
Huron
under
a
pale
*NL*
skin
--
La
Longue
Carabine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
pronunciation
of
so
terrible
a
name
produced
the
usual
effect
among
*NL*
his
auditors
.
But
when
time
was
given
for
reflection
,
and
the
warriors
*NL*
remembered
that
their
formidable
and
daring
enemy
had
even
been
in
the
*NL*
bosom
of
their
encampment
,
working
injury
,
fearful
rage
took
the
place
*NL*
of
wonder
,
and
all
those
fierce
passions
with
which
the
bosom
of
Magua
*NL*
had
just
been
struggling
were
suddenly
transferred
to
his
companions
.
*NL*
Some
among
them
gnashed
their
teeth
in
anger
,
others
vented
their
*NL*
feelings
in
yells
,
and
some
,
again
,
beat
the
air
as
frantically
as
if
*NL*
the
object
of
their
resentment
were
suffering
under
their
blows
.
But
*NL*
this
sudden
outbreaking
of
temper
as
quickly
subsided
in
the
still
and
*NL*
sullen
restraint
they
most
affected
in
their
moments
of
inaction
.
*NL*
*NL*
Magua
,
who
had
in
his
turn
found
leisure
for
reflection
,
now
changed
his
*NL*
manner
,
and
assumed
the
air
of
one
who
knew
how
to
think
and
act
with
a
*NL*
dignity
worthy
of
so
grave
a
subject
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
go
to
my
people
,
''
he
said
;
``
they
wait
for
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
companions
consented
in
silence
,
and
the
whole
of
the
savage
party
*NL*
left
the
cavern
and
returned
to
the
council-lodge
.
When
they
were
*NL*
seated
,
all
eyes
turned
on
Magua
,
who
understood
,
from
such
an
*NL*
indication
,
that
,
by
common
consent
,
they
had
devolved
the
duty
of
*NL*
relating
what
had
passed
on
him
.
He
arose
,
and
told
his
tale
without
*NL*
duplicity
or
reservation
.
The
whole
deception
practised
by
both
Duncan
*NL*
and
Hawkeye
was
,
of
course
,
laid
naked
,
and
no
room
was
found
,
even
for
*NL*
the
most
superstitious
of
the
tribe
,
any
longer
to
affix
a
doubt
on
the
*NL*
character
of
the
occurrences
.
It
was
but
too
apparent
that
they
had
been
*NL*
insultingly
,
shamefully
,
disgracefully
deceived
.
When
he
had
ended
,
and
*NL*
resumed
his
seat
,
the
collected
tribe
--
for
his
auditors
,
in
substance
,
*NL*
included
all
the
fighting
men
of
the
party
--
sat
regarding
each
other
*NL*
like
men
astonished
equally
at
the
audacity
and
the
success
of
*NL*
their
enemies
.
The
next
consideration
,
however
,
was
the
means
and
*NL*
opportunities
for
revenge
.
*NL*
*NL*
Additional
pursuers
were
sent
on
the
trail
of
the
fugitives
;
and
*NL*
then
the
chiefs
applied
themselves
,
in
earnest
,
to
the
business
of
*NL*
consultation
.
Many
different
expedients
were
proposed
by
the
elder
*NL*
warriors
,
in
succession
,
to
all
of
which
Magua
was
a
silent
and
*NL*
respectful
listener
.
That
subtle
savage
had
recovered
his
artifice
and
*NL*
self-command
,
and
now
proceeded
toward
his
object
with
his
customary
*NL*
caution
and
skill
.
It
was
only
when
each
one
disposed
to
speak
had
*NL*
uttered
his
sentiments
,
that
he
prepared
to
advance
his
own
opinions
.
*NL*
They
were
given
with
additional
weight
from
the
circumstance
that
some
*NL*
of
the
runners
had
already
returned
,
and
reported
that
their
enemies
had
*NL*
been
traced
so
far
as
to
leave
no
doubt
of
their
having
sought
safety
in
*NL*
the
neighboring
camp
of
their
suspected
allies
,
the
Delawares
.
With
the
*NL*
advantage
of
possessing
this
important
intelligence
,
the
chief
warily
*NL*
laid
his
plans
before
his
fellows
,
and
,
as
might
have
been
anticipated
*NL*
from
his
eloquence
and
cunning
,
they
were
adopted
without
a
dissenting
*NL*
voice
.
They
were
,
briefly
,
as
follows
,
both
in
opinions
and
in
motives
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
has
been
already
stated
that
,
in
obedience
to
a
policy
rarely
*NL*
departed
from
,
the
sisters
were
separated
so
soon
as
they
reached
the
*NL*
Huron
village
.
Magua
had
early
discovered
that
in
retaining
the
person
*NL*
of
Alice
,
he
possessed
the
most
effectual
check
on
Cora
.
When
they
*NL*
parted
,
therefore
,
he
kept
the
former
within
reach
of
his
hand
,
*NL*
consigning
the
one
he
most
valued
to
the
keeping
of
their
allies
.
The
*NL*
arrangement
was
understood
to
be
merely
temporary
,
and
was
made
as
much
*NL*
with
a
view
to
flatter
his
neighbors
as
in
obedience
to
the
invariable
*NL*
rule
of
Indian
policy
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
goaded
incessantly
by
these
revengeful
impulses
that
in
a
savage
*NL*
seldom
slumber
,
the
chief
was
still
attentive
to
his
more
permanent
*NL*
personal
interests
.
The
follies
and
disloyalty
committed
in
his
youth
*NL*
were
to
be
expiated
by
a
long
and
painful
penance
,
ere
he
could
be
*NL*
restored
to
the
full
enjoyment
of
the
confidence
of
his
ancient
people
;
*NL*
and
without
confidence
there
could
be
no
authority
in
an
Indian
tribe
.
*NL*
In
this
delicate
and
arduous
situation
,
the
crafty
native
had
neglected
*NL*
no
means
of
increasing
his
influence
;
and
one
of
the
happiest
of
his
*NL*
expedients
had
been
the
success
with
which
he
had
cultivated
the
favor
*NL*
of
their
powerful
and
dangerous
neighbors
.
The
result
of
his
experiment
*NL*
had
answered
all
the
expectations
of
his
policy
;
for
the
Hurons
were
in
*NL*
no
degree
exempt
from
that
governing
principle
of
nature
,
which
induces
*NL*
man
to
value
his
gifts
precisely
in
the
degree
that
they
are
appreciated
*NL*
by
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
while
he
was
making
this
ostensible
sacrifice
to
general
*NL*
considerations
,
Magua
never
lost
sight
of
his
individual
motives
.
The
*NL*
latter
had
been
frustrated
by
the
unlooked-for
events
which
had
placed
*NL*
all
his
prisoners
beyond
his
control
;
and
he
now
found
himself
reduced
*NL*
to
the
necessity
of
suing
for
favors
to
those
whom
it
had
so
lately
been
*NL*
his
policy
to
oblige
.
*NL*
*NL*
Several
of
the
chiefs
had
proposed
deep
and
treacherous
schemes
to
*NL*
surprise
the
Delawares
and
,
by
gaining
possession
of
their
camp
,
to
*NL*
recover
their
prisoners
by
the
same
blow
;
for
all
agreed
that
their
*NL*
honor
,
their
interests
,
and
the
peace
and
happiness
of
their
dead
*NL*
countrymen
,
imperiously
required
them
speedily
to
immolate
some
victims
*NL*
to
their
revenge
.
But
plans
so
dangerous
to
attempt
,
and
of
such
*NL*
doubtful
issue
,
Magua
found
little
difficulty
in
defeating
.
He
exposed
*NL*
their
risk
and
fallacy
with
his
usual
skill
;
and
it
was
only
after
he
*NL*
had
removed
every
impediment
,
in
the
shape
of
opposing
advice
,
that
he
*NL*
ventured
to
propose
his
own
projects
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
commenced
by
flattering
the
self-love
of
his
auditors
;
a
*NL*
never-failing
method
of
commanding
attention
.
When
he
had
enumerated
the
*NL*
many
different
occasions
on
which
the
Hurons
had
exhibited
their
courage
*NL*
and
prowess
,
in
the
punishment
of
insults
,
he
digressed
in
a
high
*NL*
encomium
on
the
virtue
of
wisdom
.
He
painted
the
quality
as
forming
the
*NL*
great
point
of
difference
between
the
beaver
and
other
brutes
;
between
*NL*
the
brutes
and
men
;
and
,
finally
,
between
the
Hurons
,
in
particular
,
*NL*
and
the
rest
of
the
human
race
.
After
he
had
sufficiently
extolled
the
*NL*
property
of
discretion
,
he
undertook
to
exhibit
in
what
manner
its
use
*NL*
was
applicable
to
the
present
situation
of
their
tribe
.
On
the
one
hand
,
*NL*
he
said
,
was
their
great
pale
father
,
the
governor
of
the
Canadas
,
who
*NL*
had
looked
upon
his
children
with
a
hard
eye
since
their
tomahawks
had
*NL*
been
so
red
;
on
the
other
,
a
people
as
numerous
as
themselves
,
who
spoke
*NL*
a
different
language
,
possessed
different
interests
,
and
loved
them
not
,
*NL*
and
who
would
be
glad
of
any
pretense
to
bring
them
in
disgrace
with
the
*NL*
great
white
chief
.
Then
he
spoke
of
their
necessities
;
of
the
gifts
they
*NL*
had
a
right
to
expect
for
their
past
services
;
of
their
distance
from
*NL*
their
proper
hunting-grounds
and
native
villages
;
and
of
the
necessity
*NL*
of
consulting
prudence
more
,
and
inclination
less
,
in
so
critical
*NL*
circumstances
.
When
he
perceived
that
,
while
the
old
men
applauded
his
*NL*
moderation
,
many
of
the
fiercest
and
most
distinguished
of
the
warriors
*NL*
listened
to
these
politic
plans
with
lowering
looks
,
he
cunningly
led
*NL*
them
back
to
the
subject
which
they
most
loved
.
He
spoke
openly
of
the
*NL*
fruits
of
their
wisdom
,
which
he
boldly
pronounced
would
be
a
complete
*NL*
and
final
triumph
over
their
enemies
.
He
even
darkly
hinted
that
their
*NL*
success
might
be
extended
,
with
proper
caution
,
in
such
a
manner
as
to
*NL*
include
the
destruction
of
all
whom
they
had
reason
to
hate
.
In
short
,
*NL*
he
so
blended
the
warlike
with
the
artful
,
the
obvious
with
the
obscure
,
*NL*
as
to
flatter
the
propensities
of
both
parties
,
and
to
leave
to
each
*NL*
subject
of
hope
,
while
neither
could
say
it
clearly
comprehended
his
*NL*
intentions
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
orator
,
or
the
politician
,
who
can
produce
such
a
state
of
things
,
*NL*
is
commonly
popular
with
his
contemporaries
,
however
he
may
be
treated
*NL*
by
posterity
.
All
perceived
that
more
was
meant
than
was
uttered
,
and
*NL*
each
one
believed
that
the
hidden
meaning
was
precisely
such
as
his
*NL*
own
faculties
enabled
him
to
understand
,
or
his
own
wishes
led
him
to
*NL*
anticipate
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
happy
state
of
things
,
it
is
not
surprising
that
the
management
*NL*
of
Magua
prevailed
.
The
tribe
consented
to
act
with
deliberation
,
and
*NL*
with
one
voice
they
committed
the
direction
of
the
whole
affair
to
the
*NL*
government
of
the
chief
who
had
suggested
such
wise
and
intelligible
*NL*
expedients
.
*NL*
*NL*
Magua
had
now
attained
one
great
object
of
all
his
cunning
and
*NL*
enterprise
.
The
ground
he
had
lost
in
the
favor
of
his
people
was
*NL*
completely
regained
,
and
he
found
himself
even
placed
at
the
head
*NL*
of
affairs
.
He
was
,
in
truth
,
their
ruler
;
and
,
so
long
as
he
could
*NL*
maintain
his
popularity
,
no
monarch
could
be
more
despotic
,
especially
*NL*
while
the
tribe
continued
in
a
hostile
country
.
Throwing
off
,
therefore
,
*NL*
the
appearance
of
consultation
,
he
assumed
the
grave
air
of
authority
*NL*
necessary
to
support
the
dignity
of
his
office
.
*NL*
*NL*
Runners
were
despatched
for
intelligence
in
different
directions
;
spies
*NL*
were
ordered
to
approach
and
feel
the
encampment
of
the
Delawares
;
the
*NL*
warriors
were
dismissed
to
their
lodges
,
with
an
intimation
that
their
*NL*
services
would
soon
be
needed
;
and
the
women
and
children
were
ordered
*NL*
to
retire
,
with
a
warning
that
it
was
their
province
to
be
silent
.
When
*NL*
these
several
arrangements
were
made
,
Magua
passed
through
the
village
,
*NL*
stopping
here
and
there
to
pay
a
visit
where
he
thought
his
presence
*NL*
might
be
flattering
to
the
individual
.
He
confirmed
his
friends
in
their
*NL*
confidence
,
fixed
the
wavering
,
and
gratified
all
.
Then
he
sought
his
*NL*
own
lodge
.
The
wife
the
Huron
chief
had
abandoned
,
when
he
was
chased
*NL*
from
among
his
people
,
was
dead
.
Children
he
had
none
;
and
he
now
*NL*
occupied
a
hut
,
without
companion
of
any
sort
.
It
was
,
in
fact
,
the
*NL*
dilapidated
and
solitary
structure
in
which
David
had
been
discovered
,
*NL*
and
whom
he
had
tolerated
in
his
presence
,
on
those
few
occasions
when
*NL*
they
met
,
with
the
contemptuous
indifference
of
a
haughty
superiority
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hither
,
then
,
Magua
retired
,
when
his
labors
of
policy
were
ended
.
While
*NL*
others
slept
,
however
,
he
neither
knew
or
sought
repose
.
Had
there
been
*NL*
one
sufficiently
curious
to
have
watched
the
movements
of
the
newly
*NL*
elected
chief
,
he
would
have
seen
him
seated
in
a
corner
of
his
*NL*
lodge
,
musing
on
the
subject
of
his
future
plans
,
from
the
hour
of
his
*NL*
retirement
to
the
time
he
had
appointed
for
the
warriors
to
assemble
*NL*
again
.
Occasionally
the
air
breathed
through
the
crevices
of
the
hut
,
*NL*
and
the
low
flame
that
fluttered
about
the
embers
of
the
fire
threw
*NL*
their
wavering
light
on
the
person
of
the
sullen
recluse
.
At
such
*NL*
moments
it
would
not
have
been
difficult
to
have
fancied
the
dusky
*NL*
savage
the
Prince
of
Darkness
brooding
on
his
own
fancied
wrongs
,
and
*NL*
plotting
evil
.
*NL*
*NL*
Long
before
the
day
dawned
,
however
,
warrior
after
warrior
entered
the
*NL*
solitary
hut
of
Magua
,
until
they
had
collected
to
the
number
of
twenty
.
*NL*
Each
bore
his
rifle
,
and
all
the
other
accouterments
of
war
,
though
*NL*
the
paint
was
uniformly
peaceful
.
The
entrance
of
these
fierce-looking
*NL*
beings
was
unnoticed
:
some
seating
themselves
in
the
shadows
of
the
*NL*
place
,
and
others
standing
like
motionless
statues
,
until
the
whole
of
*NL*
the
designated
band
was
collected
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Magua
arose
and
gave
the
signal
to
proceed
,
marching
himself
in
*NL*
advance
.
They
followed
their
leader
singly
,
and
in
that
well-known
order
*NL*
which
has
obtained
the
distinguishing
appellation
of
``
Indian
file
.
''
*NL*
Unlike
other
men
engaged
in
the
spirit-stirring
business
of
war
,
they
*NL*
stole
from
their
camp
unostentatiously
and
unobserved
resembling
a
band
*NL*
of
gliding
specters
,
more
than
warriors
seeking
the
bubble
reputation
by
*NL*
deeds
of
desperate
daring
.
*NL*
*NL*
Instead
of
taking
the
path
which
led
directly
toward
the
camp
of
the
*NL*
Delawares
,
Magua
led
his
party
for
some
distance
down
the
windings
of
*NL*
the
stream
,
and
along
the
little
artificial
lake
of
the
beavers
.
The
*NL*
day
began
to
dawn
as
they
entered
the
clearing
which
had
been
formed
by
*NL*
those
sagacious
and
industrious
animals
.
Though
Magua
,
who
had
resumed
*NL*
his
ancient
garb
,
bore
the
outline
of
a
fox
on
the
dressed
skin
which
*NL*
formed
his
robe
,
there
was
one
chief
of
his
party
who
carried
the
beaver
*NL*
as
his
peculiar
symbol
,
or
``
totem
.
''
There
would
have
been
a
species
of
*NL*
profanity
in
the
omission
,
had
this
man
passed
so
powerful
a
community
*NL*
of
his
fancied
kindred
,
without
bestowing
some
evidence
of
his
regard
.
*NL*
Accordingly
,
he
paused
,
and
spoke
in
words
as
kind
and
friendly
as
if
*NL*
he
were
addressing
more
intelligent
beings
.
He
called
the
animals
his
*NL*
cousins
,
and
reminded
them
that
his
protecting
influence
was
the
reason
*NL*
they
remained
unharmed
,
while
many
avaricious
traders
were
prompting
the
*NL*
Indians
to
take
their
lives
.
He
promised
a
continuance
of
his
favors
,
*NL*
and
admonished
them
to
be
grateful
.
After
which
,
he
spoke
of
the
*NL*
expedition
in
which
he
was
himself
engaged
,
and
intimated
,
though
with
*NL*
sufficient
delicacy
and
circumlocution
,
the
expediency
of
bestowing
*NL*
on
their
relative
a
portion
of
that
wisdom
for
which
they
were
so
*NL*
renowned
.
*
*NL*
*NL*
*
These
harangues
of
the
beasts
were
frequent
among
the
*NL*
Indians
.
They
often
address
their
victims
in
this
way
,
*NL*
reproaching
them
for
cowardice
or
commending
their
*NL*
resolution
,
as
they
may
happen
to
exhibit
fortitude
or
the
*NL*
reverse
,
in
suffering
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
utterance
of
this
extraordinary
address
,
the
companions
of
*NL*
the
speaker
were
as
grave
and
as
attentive
to
his
language
as
though
*NL*
they
were
all
equally
impressed
with
its
propriety
.
Once
or
twice
black
*NL*
objects
were
seen
rising
to
the
surface
of
the
water
,
and
the
Huron
*NL*
expressed
pleasure
,
conceiving
that
his
words
were
not
bestowed
in
vain
.
*NL*
Just
as
he
ended
his
address
,
the
head
of
a
large
beaver
was
thrust
*NL*
from
the
door
of
a
lodge
,
whose
earthen
walls
had
been
much
injured
,
*NL*
and
which
the
party
had
believed
,
from
its
situation
,
to
be
uninhabited
.
*NL*
Such
an
extraordinary
sign
of
confidence
was
received
by
the
orator
as
*NL*
a
highly
favorable
omen
;
and
though
the
animal
retreated
a
little
*NL*
precipitately
,
he
was
lavish
of
his
thanks
and
commendations
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Magua
thought
sufficient
time
had
been
lost
in
gratifying
the
*NL*
family
affection
of
the
warrior
,
he
again
made
the
signal
to
proceed
.
As
*NL*
the
Indians
moved
away
in
a
body
,
and
with
a
step
that
would
have
been
*NL*
inaudible
to
the
ears
of
any
common
man
,
the
same
venerable-looking
*NL*
beaver
once
more
ventured
his
head
from
its
cover
.
Had
any
of
the
Hurons
*NL*
turned
to
look
behind
them
,
they
would
have
seen
the
animal
watching
*NL*
their
movements
with
an
interest
and
sagacity
that
might
easily
have
*NL*
been
mistaken
for
reason
.
Indeed
,
so
very
distinct
and
intelligible
were
*NL*
the
devices
of
the
quadruped
,
that
even
the
most
experienced
observer
*NL*
would
have
been
at
a
loss
to
account
for
its
actions
,
until
the
moment
*NL*
when
the
party
entered
the
forest
,
when
the
whole
would
have
been
*NL*
explained
,
by
seeing
the
entire
animal
issue
from
the
lodge
,
uncasing
,
*NL*
by
the
act
,
the
grave
features
of
Chingachgook
from
his
mask
of
fur
.

*NL*
--
Much
Ado
About
Nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
tribe
,
or
rather
half
tribe
,
of
Delawares
,
which
has
been
so
*NL*
often
mentioned
,
and
whose
present
place
of
encampment
was
so
nigh
the
*NL*
temporary
village
of
the
Hurons
,
could
assemble
about
an
equal
number
of
*NL*
warriors
with
the
latter
people
.
Like
their
neighbors
,
they
had
followed
*NL*
Montcalm
into
the
territories
of
the
English
crown
,
and
were
making
*NL*
heavy
and
serious
inroads
on
the
hunting-grounds
of
the
Mohawks
;
though
*NL*
they
had
seen
fit
,
with
the
mysterious
reserve
so
common
among
the
*NL*
natives
,
to
withhold
their
assistance
at
the
moment
when
it
was
most
*NL*
required
.
The
French
had
accounted
for
this
unexpected
defection
on
*NL*
the
part
of
their
ally
in
various
ways
.
It
was
the
prevalent
opinion
,
*NL*
however
,
that
they
had
been
influenced
by
veneration
for
the
ancient
*NL*
treaty
,
that
had
once
made
them
dependent
on
the
Six
Nations
for
*NL*
military
protection
,
and
now
rendered
them
reluctant
to
encounter
their
*NL*
former
masters
.
As
for
the
tribe
itself
,
it
had
been
content
to
announce
*NL*
to
Montcalm
,
through
his
emissaries
,
with
Indian
brevity
,
that
their
*NL*
hatchets
were
dull
,
and
time
was
necessary
to
sharpen
them
.
The
politic
*NL*
captain
of
the
Canadas
had
deemed
it
wiser
to
submit
to
entertain
a
*NL*
passive
friend
,
than
by
any
acts
of
ill-judged
severity
to
convert
him
*NL*
into
an
open
enemy
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
that
morning
when
Magua
led
his
silent
party
from
the
settlement
of
*NL*
the
beavers
into
the
forests
,
in
the
manner
described
,
the
sun
rose
upon
*NL*
the
Delaware
encampment
as
if
it
had
suddenly
burst
upon
a
busy
people
,
*NL*
actively
employed
in
all
the
customary
avocations
of
high
noon
.
The
*NL*
women
ran
from
lodge
to
lodge
,
some
engaged
in
preparing
their
morning
's
*NL*
meal
,
a
few
earnestly
bent
on
seeking
the
comforts
necessary
to
their
*NL*
habits
,
but
more
pausing
to
exchange
hasty
and
whispered
sentences
with
*NL*
their
friends
.
The
warriors
were
lounging
in
groups
,
musing
more
than
*NL*
they
conversed
and
when
a
few
words
were
uttered
,
speaking
like
men
who
*NL*
deeply
weighed
their
opinions
.
The
instruments
of
the
chase
were
to
be
*NL*
seen
in
abundance
among
the
lodges
;
but
none
departed
.
Here
and
there
*NL*
a
warrior
was
examining
his
arms
,
with
an
attention
that
is
rarely
*NL*
bestowed
on
the
implements
,
when
no
other
enemy
than
the
beasts
of
the
*NL*
forest
is
expected
to
be
encountered
.
And
occasionally
,
the
eyes
of
a
*NL*
whole
group
were
turned
simultaneously
toward
a
large
and
silent
lodge
*NL*
in
the
center
of
the
village
,
as
if
it
contained
the
subject
of
their
*NL*
common
thoughts
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
existence
of
this
scene
,
a
man
suddenly
appeared
at
the
*NL*
furthest
extremity
of
a
platform
of
rock
which
formed
the
level
of
the
*NL*
village
.
He
was
without
arms
,
and
his
paint
tended
rather
to
soften
than
*NL*
increase
the
natural
sternness
of
his
austere
countenance
.
When
in
*NL*
full
view
of
the
Delawares
he
stopped
,
and
made
a
gesture
of
amity
,
*NL*
by
throwing
his
arm
upward
toward
heaven
,
and
then
letting
it
fall
*NL*
impressively
on
his
breast
.
The
inhabitants
of
the
village
answered
*NL*
his
salute
by
a
low
murmur
of
welcome
,
and
encouraged
him
to
advance
by
*NL*
similar
indications
of
friendship
.
Fortified
by
these
assurances
,
the
*NL*
dark
figure
left
the
brow
of
the
natural
rocky
terrace
,
where
it
had
*NL*
stood
a
moment
,
drawn
in
a
strong
outline
against
the
blushing
morning
*NL*
sky
,
and
moved
with
dignity
into
the
very
center
of
the
huts
.
As
he
*NL*
approached
,
nothing
was
audible
but
the
rattling
of
the
light
silver
*NL*
ornaments
that
loaded
his
arms
and
neck
,
and
the
tinkling
of
the
little
*NL*
bells
that
fringed
his
deerskin
moccasins
.
He
made
,
as
he
advanced
,
many
*NL*
courteous
signs
of
greeting
to
the
men
he
passed
,
neglecting
to
notice
*NL*
the
women
,
however
,
like
one
who
deemed
their
favor
,
in
the
present
*NL*
enterprise
,
of
no
importance
.
When
he
had
reached
the
group
in
which
it
*NL*
was
evident
,
by
the
haughtiness
of
their
common
mien
,
that
the
principal
*NL*
chiefs
were
collected
,
the
stranger
paused
,
and
then
the
Delawares
saw
*NL*
that
the
active
and
erect
form
that
stood
before
them
was
that
of
the
*NL*
well-known
Huron
chief
,
Le
Renard
Subtil
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
reception
was
grave
,
silent
,
and
wary
.
The
warriors
in
front
stepped
*NL*
aside
,
opening
the
way
to
their
most
approved
orator
by
the
action
;
one
*NL*
who
spoke
all
those
languages
that
were
cultivated
among
the
northern
*NL*
aborigines
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
wise
Huron
is
welcome
,
''
said
the
Delaware
,
in
the
language
of
the
*NL*
Maquas
;
``
he
is
come
to
eat
his
`
succotash
'
*
,
with
his
brothers
of
the
*NL*
lakes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*
A
dish
composed
of
cracked
corn
and
beans
.
It
is
much
used
*NL*
also
by
the
whites
.
By
corn
is
meant
maise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
come
,
''
repeated
Magua
,
bending
his
head
with
the
dignity
of
an
*NL*
eastern
prince
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
chief
extended
his
arm
and
taking
the
other
by
the
wrist
,
they
once
*NL*
more
exchanged
friendly
salutations
.
Then
the
Delaware
invited
his
guest
*NL*
to
enter
his
own
lodge
,
and
share
his
morning
meal
.
The
invitation
was
*NL*
accepted
;
and
the
two
warriors
,
attended
by
three
or
four
of
the
old
*NL*
men
,
walked
calmly
away
,
leaving
the
rest
of
the
tribe
devoured
by
a
*NL*
desire
to
understand
the
reasons
of
so
unusual
a
visit
,
and
yet
not
*NL*
betraying
the
least
impatience
by
sign
or
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
short
and
frugal
repast
that
followed
,
the
conversation
was
*NL*
extremely
circumspect
,
and
related
entirely
to
the
events
of
the
hunt
,
*NL*
in
which
Magua
had
so
lately
been
engaged
.
It
would
have
been
impossible
*NL*
for
the
most
finished
breeding
to
wear
more
of
the
appearance
of
*NL*
considering
the
visit
as
a
thing
of
course
,
than
did
his
hosts
,
*NL*
notwithstanding
every
individual
present
was
perfectly
aware
that
*NL*
it
must
be
connected
with
some
secret
object
and
that
probably
of
*NL*
importance
to
themselves
.
When
the
appetites
of
the
whole
were
appeased
,
*NL*
the
squaws
removed
the
trenchers
and
gourds
,
and
the
two
parties
began
*NL*
to
prepare
themselves
for
a
subtle
trial
of
their
wits
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
the
face
of
my
great
Canada
father
turned
again
toward
his
Huron
*NL*
children
?
''
demanded
the
orator
of
the
Delawares
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
was
it
ever
otherwise
?
''
returned
Magua
.
``
He
calls
my
people
`
most
*NL*
beloved
'
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Delaware
gravely
bowed
his
acquiescence
to
what
he
knew
to
be
false
,
*NL*
and
continued
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
tomahawks
of
your
young
men
have
been
very
red
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
so
;
but
they
are
now
bright
and
dull
;
for
the
Yengeese
are
dead
,
*NL*
and
the
Delawares
are
our
neighbors
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
other
acknowledged
the
pacific
compliment
by
a
gesture
of
the
hand
,
*NL*
and
remained
silent
.
Then
Magua
,
as
if
recalled
to
such
a
recollection
,
*NL*
by
the
allusion
to
the
massacre
,
demanded
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
my
prisoner
give
trouble
to
my
brothers
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
welcome
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
path
between
the
Hurons
and
the
Delawares
is
short
and
it
is
open
;
*NL*
let
her
be
sent
to
my
squaws
,
if
she
gives
trouble
to
my
brother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
welcome
,
''
returned
the
chief
of
the
latter
nation
,
still
more
*NL*
emphatically
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
baffled
Magua
continued
silent
several
minutes
,
apparently
*NL*
indifferent
,
however
,
to
the
repulse
he
had
received
in
this
his
opening
*NL*
effort
to
regain
possession
of
Cora
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
my
young
men
leave
the
Delawares
room
on
the
mountains
for
their
*NL*
hunts
?
''
he
at
length
continued
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Lenape
are
rulers
of
their
own
hills
,
''
returned
the
other
a
little
*NL*
haughtily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
well
.
Justice
is
the
master
of
a
red-skin
.
Why
should
they
*NL*
brighten
their
tomahawks
and
sharpen
their
knives
against
each
other
?
*NL*
Are
not
the
pale
faces
thicker
than
the
swallows
in
the
season
of
*NL*
flowers
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
!
''
exclaimed
two
or
three
of
his
auditors
at
the
same
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
Magua
waited
a
little
,
to
permit
his
words
to
soften
the
feelings
of
the
*NL*
Delawares
,
before
he
added
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
there
not
been
strange
moccasins
in
the
woods
?
Have
not
my
*NL*
brothers
scented
the
feet
of
white
men
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
my
Canada
father
come
,
''
returned
the
other
,
evasively
;
``
his
*NL*
children
are
ready
to
see
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
the
great
chief
comes
,
it
is
to
smoke
with
the
Indians
in
their
*NL*
wigwams
.
The
Hurons
say
,
too
,
he
is
welcome
.
But
the
Yengeese
have
long
*NL*
arms
,
and
legs
that
never
tire
!
My
young
men
dreamed
they
had
seen
the
*NL*
trail
of
the
Yengeese
nigh
the
village
of
the
Delawares
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
will
not
find
the
Lenape
asleep
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
well
.
The
warrior
whose
eye
is
open
can
see
his
enemy
,
''
said
*NL*
Magua
,
once
more
shifting
his
ground
,
when
he
found
himself
unable
to
*NL*
penetrate
the
caution
of
his
companion
.
``
I
have
brought
gifts
to
my
*NL*
brother
.
His
nation
would
not
go
on
the
warpath
,
because
they
did
not
*NL*
think
it
well
,
but
their
friends
have
remembered
where
they
lived
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
had
thus
announced
his
liberal
intention
,
the
crafty
chief
*NL*
arose
,
and
gravely
spread
his
presents
before
the
dazzled
eyes
of
his
*NL*
hosts
.
They
consisted
principally
of
trinkets
of
little
value
,
plundered
*NL*
from
the
slaughtered
females
of
William
Henry
.
In
the
division
of
*NL*
the
baubles
the
cunning
Huron
discovered
no
less
art
than
in
their
*NL*
selection
.
While
he
bestowed
those
of
greater
value
on
the
two
most
*NL*
distinguished
warriors
,
one
of
whom
was
his
host
,
he
seasoned
his
*NL*
offerings
to
their
inferiors
with
such
well-timed
and
apposite
*NL*
compliments
,
as
left
them
no
ground
of
complaint
.
In
short
,
the
whole
*NL*
ceremony
contained
such
a
happy
blending
of
the
profitable
with
the
*NL*
flattering
,
that
it
was
not
difficult
for
the
donor
immediately
to
read
*NL*
the
effect
of
a
generosity
so
aptly
mingled
with
praise
,
in
the
eyes
of
*NL*
those
he
addressed
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
well-judged
and
politic
stroke
on
the
part
of
Magua
was
not
without
*NL*
instantaneous
results
.
The
Delawares
lost
their
gravity
in
a
much
more
*NL*
cordial
expression
;
and
the
host
,
in
particular
,
after
contemplating
*NL*
his
own
liberal
share
of
the
spoil
for
some
moments
with
peculiar
*NL*
gratification
,
repeated
with
strong
emphasis
,
the
words
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
brother
is
a
wise

He
is
welcome

*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Hurons

returned
Magua
.
``
Why
*NL*
should
they
not
?
they
are
colored
by
the
same
sun
,
and
their
just
men
*NL*
will
hunt
in
the
same
grounds
after
death
.
The
red-skins
should
be
*NL*
friends
,
and
look
with
open
eyes
on
the
white
men
.
Has
not
my
brother
*NL*
scented
spies
in
the
woods
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Delaware
,
whose
name
in
English
signified
``
Hard
Heart
,
''
an
*NL*
appellation
that
the
French
had
translated
into
``
le
Coeur-dur
,
''
forgot
*NL*
that
obduracy
of
purpose
,
which
had
probably
obtained
him
so
significant
*NL*
a
title
.
His
countenance
grew
very
sensibly
less
stern
and
he
now
*NL*
deigned
to
answer
more
directly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
have
been
strange
moccasins
about
my
camp
.
They
have
been
tracked
*NL*
into
my
lodges
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
my
brother
beat
out
the
dogs
?
''
asked
Magua
,
without
adverting
in
*NL*
any
manner
to
the
former
equivocation
of
the
chief
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
not
do
.
The
stranger
is
always
welcome
to
the
children
of
the
*NL*
Lenape
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
stranger
,
but
not
the
spy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
the
Yengeese
send
their
women
as
spies
?
Did
not
the
Huron
chief
*NL*
say
he
took
women
in
the
battle
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
told
no
lie
.
The
Yengeese
have
sent
out
their
scouts
.
They
have
been
*NL*
in
my
wigwams
,
but
they
found
there
no
one
to
say
welcome
.
Then
they
*NL*
fled
to
the
Delawares
--
for
,
say
they
,
the
Delawares
are
our
friends
;
*NL*
their
minds
are
turned
from
their
Canada
father
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
insinuation
was
a
home
thrust
,
and
one
that
in
a
more
advanced
*NL*
state
of
society
would
have
entitled
Magua
to
the
reputation
of
a
*NL*
skillful
diplomatist
.
The
recent
defection
of
the
tribe
had
,
as
they
*NL*
well
knew
themselves
,
subjected
the
Delawares
to
much
reproach
among
*NL*
their
French
allies
;
and
they
were
now
made
to
feel
that
their
future
*NL*
actions
were
to
be
regarded
with
jealousy
and
distrust
.
There
was
no
*NL*
deep
insight
into
causes
and
effects
necessary
to
foresee
that
such
*NL*
a
situation
of
things
was
likely
to
prove
highly
prejudicial
to
their
*NL*
future
movements
.
Their
distant
villages
,
their
hunting-grounds
and
*NL*
hundreds
of
their
women
and
children
,
together
with
a
material
part
*NL*
of
their
physical
force
,
were
actually
within
the
limits
of
the
French
*NL*
territory
.
Accordingly
,
this
alarming
annunciation
was
received
,
as
*NL*
Magua
intended
,
with
manifest
disapprobation
,
if
not
with
alarm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
my
father
look
in
my
face
,
''
said
Le
Coeur-dur
;
``
he
will
see
no
*NL*
change
.
It
is
true
,
my
young
men
did
not
go
out
on
the
war-path
;
they
*NL*
had
dreams
for
not
doing
so
.
But
they
love
and
venerate
the
great
white
*NL*
chief
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
he
think
so
when
he
hears
that
his
greatest
enemy
is
fed
in
the
*NL*
camp
of
his

When
he
is
told
a
bloody
Yengee
smokes
at
your
*NL*
fire
?
That
the
pale
face
who
has
slain
so
many
of
his
friends
goes
in
*NL*
and
out
among
the
Delawares
?
Go

my
great
Canada
father
is
not
a
fool
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
is
the
Yengee
that
the
Delawares
fear
?
''
returned
the
other
;
``
who
*NL*
has
slain
my
young
men

Who
is
the
mortal
enemy
of
my
Great
Father
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
La
Longue
Carabine
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Delaware
warriors
started
at
the
well-known
name
,
betraying
by
their
*NL*
amazement
,
that
they
now
learned
,
for
the
first
time
,
one
so
famous
*NL*
among
the
Indian
allies
of
France
was
within
their
power
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
does
my
brother
mean
?
''
demanded
Le
Coeur-dur
,
in
a
tone
that
,
by
*NL*
its
wonder
,
far
exceeded
the
usual
apathy
of
his
race
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
Huron
never
lies
!
''
returned
Magua
,
coldly
,
leaning
his
head
against
*NL*
the
side
of
the
lodge
,
and
drawing
his
slight
robe
across
his
tawny
*NL*
breast
.
``
Let
the
Delawares
count
their
prisoners
;
they
will
find
one
*NL*
whose
skin
is
neither
red
nor
pale
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
long
and
musing
pause
succeeded
.
The
chief
consulted
apart
with
his
*NL*
companions
,
and
messengers
despatched
to
collect
certain
others
of
the
*NL*
most
distinguished
men
of
the
tribe
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
warrior
after
warrior
dropped
in
,
they
were
each
made
acquainted
,
in
*NL*
turn
,
with
the
important
intelligence
that
Magua
had
just
communicated
.
*NL*
The
air
of
surprise
,
and
the
usual
low
,
deep
,
guttural
exclamation
,
were
*NL*
common
to
them
all
.
The
news
spread
from
mouth
to
mouth
,
until
the
whole
*NL*
encampment
became
powerfully
agitated
.
The
women
suspended
their
*NL*
labors
,
to
catch
such
syllables
as
unguardedly
fell
from
the
lips
of
*NL*
the
consulting
warriors
.
The
boys
deserted
their
sports
,
and
walking
*NL*
fearlessly
among
their
fathers
,
looked
up
in
curious
admiration
,
as
*NL*
they
heard
the
brief
exclamations
of
wonder
they
so
freely
expressed
the
*NL*
temerity
of
their
hated
foe
.
In
short
,
every
occupation
was
abandoned
*NL*
for
the
time
,
and
all
other
pursuits
seemed
discarded
in
order
that
the
*NL*
tribe
might
freely
indulge
,
after
their
own
peculiar
manner
,
in
an
open
*NL*
expression
of
feeling
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
excitement
had
a
little
abated
,
the
old
men
disposed
themselves
*NL*
seriously
to
consider
that
which
it
became
the
honor
and
safety
of
*NL*
their
tribe
to
perform
,
under
circumstances
of
so
much
delicacy
and
*NL*
embarrassment
.
During
all
these
movements
,
and
in
the
midst
of
the
*NL*
general
commotion
,
Magua
had
not
only
maintained
his
seat
,
but
the
very
*NL*
attitude
he
had
originally
taken
,
against
the
side
of
the
lodge
,
where
*NL*
he
continued
as
immovable
,
and
,
apparently
,
as
unconcerned
,
as
if
he
*NL*
had
no
interest
in
the
result
.
Not
a
single
indication
of
the
future
*NL*
intentions
of
his
hosts
,
however
,
escaped
his
vigilant
eyes
.
With
his
*NL*
consummate
knowledge
of
the
nature
of
the
people
with
whom
he
had
to
*NL*
deal
,
he
anticipated
every
measure
on
which
they
decided
;
and
it
might
*NL*
almost
be
said
,
that
,
in
many
instances
,
he
knew
their
intentions
,
even
*NL*
before
they
became
known
to
themselves
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
council
of
the
Delawares
was
short
.
When
it
was
ended
,
a
general
*NL*
bustle
announced
that
it
was
to
be
immediately
succeeded
by
a
solemn
and
*NL*
formal
assemblage
of
the
nation
.
As
such
meetings
were
rare
,
and
only
*NL*
called
on
occasions
of
the
last
importance
,
the
subtle
Huron
,
who
still
*NL*
sat
apart
,
a
wily
and
dark
observer
of
the
proceedings
,
now
knew
that
*NL*
all
his
projects
must
be
brought
to
their
final
issue
.
He
,
therefore
,
*NL*
left
the
lodge
and
walked
silently
forth
to
the
place
,
in
front
of
the
*NL*
encampment
,
whither
the
warriors
were
already
beginning
to
collect
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
might
have
been
half
an
hour
before
each
individual
,
including
even
*NL*
the
women
and
children
,
was
in
his
place
.
The
delay
had
been
created
*NL*
by
the
grave
preparations
that
were
deemed
necessary
to
so
solemn
and
*NL*
unusual
a
conference
.
But
when
the
sun
was
seen
climbing
above
the
tops
*NL*
of
that
mountain
,
against
whose
bosom
the
Delawares
had
constructed
*NL*
their
encampment
,
most
were
seated
;
and
as
his
bright
rays
darted
from
*NL*
behind
the
outline
of
trees
that
fringed
the
eminence
,
they
fell
upon
*NL*
as
grave
,
as
attentive
,
and
as
deeply
interested
a
multitude
,
as
was
*NL*
probably
ever
before
lighted
by
his
morning
beams
.
Its
number
somewhat
*NL*
exceeded
a
thousand
souls
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
collection
of
so
serious
savages
,
there
is
never
to
be
found
any
*NL*
impatient
aspirant
after
premature
distinction
,
standing
ready
to
move
*NL*
his
auditors
to
some
hasty
,
and
,
perhaps
,
injudicious
discussion
,
in
*NL*
order
that
his
own
reputation
may
be
the
gainer
.
An
act
of
so
much
*NL*
precipitancy
and
presumption
would
seal
the
downfall
of
precocious
*NL*
intellect
forever
.
It
rested
solely
with
the
oldest
and
most
experienced
*NL*
of
the
men
to
lay
the
subject
of
the
conference
before
the
people
.
Until
*NL*
such
a
one
chose
to
make
some
movement
,
no
deeds
in
arms
,
no
natural
*NL*
gifts
,
nor
any
renown
as
an
orator
,
would
have
justified
the
slightest
*NL*
interruption
.
On
the
present
occasion
,
the
aged
warrior
whose
privilege
*NL*
it
was
to
speak
,
was
silent
,
seemingly
oppressed
with
the
magnitude
*NL*
of
his
subject
.
The
delay
had
already
continued
long
beyond
the
usual
*NL*
deliberative
pause
that
always
preceded
a
conference
;
but
no
sign
of
*NL*
impatience
or
surprise
escaped
even
the
youngest
boy
.
Occasionally
an
*NL*
eye
was
raised
from
the
earth
,
where
the
looks
of
most
were
riveted
,
*NL*
and
strayed
toward
a
particular
lodge
,
that
was
,
however
,
in
no
manner
*NL*
distinguished
from
those
around
it
,
except
in
the
peculiar
care
that
had
*NL*
been
taken
to
protect
it
against
the
assaults
of
the
weather
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
one
of
those
low
murmurs
,
that
are
so
apt
to
disturb
a
*NL*
multitude
,
was
heard
,
and
the
whole
nation
arose
to
their
feet
by
*NL*
a
common
impulse
.
At
that
instant
the
door
of
the
lodge
in
question
*NL*
opened
,
and
three
men
,
issuing
from
it
,
slowly
approached
the
place
of
*NL*
consultation
.
They
were
all
aged
,
even
beyond
that
period
to
which
the
*NL*
oldest
present
had
reached
;
but
one
in
the
center
,
who
leaned
on
his
*NL*
companions
for
support
,
had
numbered
an
amount
of
years
to
which
the
*NL*
human
race
is
seldom
permitted
to
attain
.
His
frame
,
which
had
once
been
*NL*
tall
and
erect
,
like
the
cedar
,
was
now
bending
under
the
pressure
of
*NL*
more
than
a
century
.
The
elastic
,
light
step
of
an
Indian
was
gone
,
and
*NL*
in
its
place
he
was
compelled
to
toil
his
tardy
way
over
the
ground
,
*NL*
inch
by
inch
.
His
dark
,
wrinkled
countenance
was
in
singular
and
wild
*NL*
contrast
with
the
long
white
locks
which
floated
on
his
shoulders
,
in
*NL*
such
thickness
,
as
to
announce
that
generations
had
probably
passed
away
*NL*
since
they
had
last
been
shorn
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
dress
of
this
patriarch
--
for
such
,
considering
his
vast
age
,
in
*NL*
conjunction
with
his
affinity
and
influence
with
his
people
,
he
might
*NL*
very
properly
be
termed
--
was
rich
and
imposing
,
though
strictly
after
*NL*
the
simple
fashions
of
the
tribe
.
His
robe
was
of
the
finest
*NL*
skins
,
which
had
been
deprived
of
their
fur
,
in
order
to
admit
of
a
*NL*
hieroglyphical
representation
of
various
deeds
in
arms
,
done
in
former
*NL*
ages
.
His
bosom
was
loaded
with
medals
,
some
in
massive
silver
,
and
one
*NL*
or
two
even
in
gold
,
the
gifts
of
various
Christian
potentates
during
*NL*
the
long
period
of
his
life
.
He
also
wore
armlets
,
and
cinctures
above
*NL*
the
ankles
,
of
the
latter
precious
metal
.
His
head
,
on
the
whole
of
*NL*
which
the
hair
had
been
permitted
to
grow
,
the
pursuits
of
war
having
so
*NL*
long
been
abandoned
,
was
encircled
by
a
sort
of
plated
diadem
,
which
,
in
*NL*
its
turn
,
bore
lesser
and
more
glittering
ornaments
,
that
sparkled
amid
*NL*
the
glossy
hues
of
three
drooping
ostrich
feathers
,
dyed
a
deep
black
,
*NL*
in
touching
contrast
to
the
color
of
his
snow-white
locks
.
His
tomahawk
*NL*
was
nearly
hid
in
silver
,
and
the
handle
of
his
knife
shone
like
a
horn
*NL*
of
solid
gold
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
soon
as
the
first
hum
of
emotion
and
pleasure
,
which
the
sudden
*NL*
appearance
of
this
venerated
individual
created
,
had
a
little
subsided
,
*NL*
the
name
of
``
Tamenund
''
was
whispered
from
mouth
to
mouth
.
Magua
had
*NL*
often
heard
the
fame
of
this
wise
and
just
Delaware
;
a
reputation
that
*NL*
even
proceeded
so
far
as
to
bestow
on
him
the
rare
gift
of
holding
*NL*
secret
communion
with
the
Great
Spirit
,
and
which
has
since
transmitted
*NL*
his
name
,
with
some
slight
alteration
,
to
the
white
usurpers
of
his
*NL*
ancient
territory
,
as
the
imaginary
tutelar
saint
*
of
a
vast
empire
.
The
*NL*
Huron
chief
,
therefore
,
stepped
eagerly
out
a
little
from
the
throng
,
*NL*
to
a
spot
whence
he
might
catch
a
nearer
glimpse
of
the
features
of
the
*NL*
man
,
whose
decision
was
likely
to
produce
so
deep
an
influence
on
his
*NL*
own
fortunes
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
The
Americans
sometimes
called
their
tutelar
saint
*NL*
Tamenay
,
a
corruption
of
the
name
of
the
renowned
chief
here
*NL*
introduced
.
There
are
many
traditions
which
speak
of
the
*NL*
character
and
power
of
Tamenund
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
eyes
of
the
old
man
were
closed
,
as
though
the
organs
were
wearied
*NL*
with
having
so
long
witnessed
the
selfish
workings
of
the
human
*NL*
passions
.
The
color
of
his
skin
differed
from
that
of
most
around
him
,
*NL*
being
richer
and
darker
,
the
latter
having
been
produced
by
certain
*NL*
delicate
and
mazy
lines
of
complicated
and
yet
beautiful
figures
,
which
*NL*
had
been
traced
over
most
of
his
person
by
the
operation
of
tattooing
.
*NL*
Notwithstanding
the
position
of
the
Huron
,
he
passed
the
observant
and
*NL*
silent
Magua
without
notice
,
and
leaning
on
his
two
venerable
supporters
*NL*
proceeded
to
the
high
place
of
the
multitude
,
where
he
seated
himself
in
*NL*
the
center
of
his
nation
,
with
the
dignity
of
a
monarch
and
the
air
of
a
*NL*
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
could
surpass
the
reverence
and
affection
with
which
this
*NL*
unexpected
visit
from
one
who
belongs
rather
to
another
world
than
to
*NL*
this
,
was
received
by
his
people
.
After
a
suitable
and
decent
pause
,
the
*NL*
principal
chiefs
arose
,
and
,
approaching
the
patriarch
,
they
placed
*NL*
his
hands
reverently
on
their
heads
,
seeming
to
entreat
a
blessing
.
The
*NL*
younger
men
were
content
with
touching
his
robe
,
or
even
drawing
nigh
*NL*
his
person
,
in
order
to
breathe
in
the
atmosphere
of
one
so
aged
,
so
*NL*
just
,
and
so
valiant
.
None
but
the
most
distinguished
among
the
youthful
*NL*
warriors
even
presumed
so
far
as
to
perform
the
latter
ceremony
,
the
*NL*
great
mass
of
the
multitude
deeming
it
a
sufficient
happiness
to
look
*NL*
upon
a
form
so
deeply
venerated
,
and
so
well
beloved
.
When
these
acts
*NL*
of
affection
and
respect
were
performed
,
the
chiefs
drew
back
again
to
*NL*
their
several
places
,
and
silence
reigned
in
the
whole
encampment
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
short
delay
,
a
few
of
the
young
men
,
to
whom
instructions
had
*NL*
been
whispered
by
one
of
the
aged
attendants
of
Tamenund
,
arose
,
left
*NL*
the
crowd
,
and
entered
the
lodge
which
has
already
been
noted
as
the
*NL*
object
of
so
much
attention
throughout
that
morning
.
In
a
few
minutes
*NL*
they
reappeared
,
escorting
the
individuals
who
had
caused
all
these
*NL*
solemn
preparations
toward
the
seat
of
judgment
.
The
crowd
opened
in
a
*NL*
lane
;
and
when
the
party
had
re-entered
,
it
closed
in
again
,
forming
a
*NL*
large
and
dense
belt
of
human
bodies
,
arranged
in
an
open
circle
.

CHAPTER
29
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
assembly
seated
,
rising
o'er
the
rest
,
*NL*
Achilles
thus
the
king
of
men
addressed
.
''
*NL*
--
Pope
's
Illiad
*NL*
*NL*
Cora
stood
foremost
among
the
prisoners
,
entwining
her
arms
in
those
of
*NL*
Alice
,
in
the
tenderness
of
sisterly
love
.
Notwithstanding
the
fearful
*NL*
and
menacing
array
of
savages
on
every
side
of
her
,
no
apprehension
on
*NL*
her
own
account
could
prevent
the
nobler-minded
maiden
from
keeping
her
*NL*
eyes
fastened
on
the
pale
and
anxious
features
of
the
trembling
Alice
.
*NL*
Close
at
their
side
stood
Heyward
,
with
an
interest
in
both
,
that
,
at
*NL*
such
a
moment
of
intense
uncertainty
,
scarcely
knew
a
preponderance
in
*NL*
favor
of
her
whom
he
most
loved
.
Hawkeye
had
placed
himself
a
little
in
*NL*
the
rear
,
with
a
deference
to
the
superior
rank
of
his
companions
,
that
*NL*
no
similarity
in
the
state
of
their
present
fortunes
could
induce
him
to
*NL*
forget
.
Uncas
was
not
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
perfect
silence
was
again
restored
,
and
after
the
usual
long
,
*NL*
impressive
pause
,
one
of
the
two
aged
chiefs
who
sat
at
the
side
of
the
*NL*
patriarch
arose
,
and
demanded
aloud
,
in
very
intelligible
English
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Which
of
my
prisoners
is
La
Longue
Carabine
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Neither
Duncan
nor
the
scout
answered
.
The
former
,
however
,
glanced
his
*NL*
eyes
around
the
dark
and
silent
assembly
,
and
recoiled
a
pace
,
when
they
*NL*
fell
on
the
malignant
visage
of
Magua
.
He
saw
,
at
once
,
that
this
wily
*NL*
savage
had
some
secret
agency
in
their
present
arraignment
before
the
*NL*
nation
,
and
determined
to
throw
every
possible
impediment
in
the
way
of
*NL*
the
execution
of
his
sinister
plans
.
He
had
witnessed
one
instance
*NL*
of
the
summary
punishments
of
the
Indians
,
and
now
dreaded
that
his
*NL*
companion
was
to
be
selected
for
a
second
.
In
this
dilemma
,
with
*NL*
little
or
no
time
for
reflection
,
he
suddenly
determined
to
cloak
his
*NL*
invaluable
friend
,
at
any
or
every
hazard
to
himself
.
Before
he
had
*NL*
time
,
however
,
to
speak
,
the
question
was
repeated
in
a
louder
voice
,
*NL*
and
with
a
clearer
utterance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
us
arms
,
''
the
young
man
haughtily
replied
,
``
and
place
us
in
yonder
*NL*
woods
.
Our
deeds
shall
speak
for
us
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
the
warrior
whose
name
has
filled
our
ears
!
''
returned
the
*NL*
chief
,
regarding
Heyward
with
that
sort
of
curious
interest
which
seems
*NL*
inseparable
from
man
,
when
first
beholding
one
of
his
fellows
to
whom
*NL*
merit
or
accident
,
virtue
or
crime
,
has
given
notoriety
.
``
What
has
*NL*
brought
the
white
man
into
the
camp
of
the
Delawares
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
necessities
.
I
come
for
food
,
shelter
,
and
friends
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
can
not
be
.
The
woods
are
full
of
game
.
The
head
of
a
warrior
needs
*NL*
no
other
shelter
than
a
sky
without
clouds
;
and
the
Delawares
are
the
*NL*
enemies
,
and
not
the
friends
of
the
Yengeese
.
Go
,
the
mouth
has
spoken
,
*NL*
while
the
heart
said
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Duncan
,
a
little
at
a
loss
in
what
manner
to
proceed
,
remained
silent
;
*NL*
but
the
scout
,
who
had
listened
attentively
to
all
that
passed
,
now
*NL*
advanced
steadily
to
the
front
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
I
did
not
answer
to
the
call
for
La
Longue
Carabine
,
was
not
owing
*NL*
either
to
shame
or
fear
,
''
he
said
,
``
for
neither
one
nor
the
other
is
the
*NL*
gift
of
an
honest
man
.
But
I
do
not
admit
the
right
of
the
Mingoes
to
*NL*
bestow
a
name
on
one
whose
friends
have
been
mindful
of
his
gifts
,
in
*NL*
this
particular
;
especially
as
their
title
is
a
lie
,
`
killdeer
'
being
a
*NL*
grooved
barrel
and
no
carabyne
.
I
am
the
man
,
however
,
that
got
the
name
*NL*
of
Nathaniel
from
my
kin
;
the
compliment
of
Hawkeye
from
the
Delawares
,
*NL*
who
live
on
their
own
river
;
and
whom
the
Iroquois
have
presumed
to
*NL*
style
the
`
Long
Rifle
'
,
without
any
warranty
from
him
who
is
most
*NL*
concerned
in
the
matter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
eyes
of
all
present
,
which
had
hitherto
been
gravely
scanning
the
*NL*
person
of
Duncan
,
were
now
turned
,
on
the
instant
,
toward
the
upright
*NL*
iron
frame
of
this
new
pretender
to
the
distinguished
appellation
.
It
*NL*
was
in
no
degree
remarkable
that
there
should
be
found
two
who
were
*NL*
willing
to
claim
so
great
an
honor
,
for
impostors
,
though
rare
,
were
not
*NL*
unknown
among
the
natives
;
but
it
was
altogether
material
to
the
just
*NL*
and
severe
intentions
of
the
Delawares
,
that
there
should
be
no
mistake
*NL*
in
the
matter
.
Some
of
their
old
men
consulted
together
in
private
,
and
*NL*
then
,
as
it
would
seem
,
they
determined
to
interrogate
their
visitor
on
*NL*
the
subject
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
brother
has
said
that
a
snake
crept
into
my
camp
,
''
said
the
chief
to
*NL*
Magua
;
``
which
is
he
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Huron
pointed
to
the
scout
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
a
wise
Delaware
believe
the
barking
of
a
wolf
?
''
exclaimed
Duncan
,
*NL*
still
more
confirmed
in
the
evil
intentions
of
his
ancient
enemy
:
``
a
dog
*NL*
never
lies
,
but
when
was
a
wolf
known
to
speak
the
truth
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
eyes
of
Magua
flashed
fire
;
but
suddenly
recollecting
the
necessity
*NL*
of
maintaining
his
presence
of
mind
,
he
turned
away
in
silent
disdain
,
*NL*
well
assured
that
the
sagacity
of
the
Indians
would
not
fail
to
extract
*NL*
the
real
merits
of
the
point
in
controversy
.
He
was
not
deceived
;
for
,
*NL*
after
another
short
consultation
,
the
wary
Delaware
turned
to
him
*NL*
again
,
and
expressed
the
determination
of
the
chiefs
,
though
in
the
most
*NL*
considerate
language
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
brother
has
been
called
a
liar
,
''
he
said
,
``
and
his
friends
are
*NL*
angry
.
They
will
show
that
he
has
spoken
the
truth
.
Give
my
prisoners
*NL*
guns
,
and
let
them
prove
which
is
the
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Magua
affected
to
consider
the
expedient
,
which
he
well
knew
proceeded
*NL*
from
distrust
of
himself
,
as
a
compliment
,
and
made
a
gesture
of
*NL*
acquiescence
,
well
content
that
his
veracity
should
be
supported
by
so
*NL*
skillful
a
marksman
as
the
scout
.
The
weapons
were
instantly
placed
in
*NL*
the
hands
of
the
friendly
opponents
,
and
they
were
bid
to
fire
,
over
*NL*
the
heads
of
the
seated
multitude
,
at
an
earthen
vessel
,
which
lay
,
by
*NL*
accident
,
on
a
stump
,
some
fifty
yards
from
the
place
where
they
stood
.
*NL*
*NL*
Heyward
smiled
to
himself
at
the
idea
of
a
competition
with
the
scout
,
*NL*
though
he
determined
to
persevere
in
the
deception
,
until
apprised
of
*NL*
the
real
designs
of
Magua
.
*NL*
*NL*
Raising
his
rifle
with
the
utmost
care
,
and
renewing
his
aim
three
*NL*
several
times
,
he
fired
.
The
bullet
cut
the
wood
within
a
few
inches
of
*NL*
the
vessel
;
and
a
general
exclamation
of
satisfaction
announced
that
the
*NL*
shot
was
considered
a
proof
of
great
skill
in
the
use
of
a
weapon
.
*NL*
Even
Hawkeye
nodded
his
head
,
as
if
he
would
say
,
it
was
better
than
he
*NL*
expected
.
But
,
instead
of
manifesting
an
intention
to
contend
with
*NL*
the
successful
marksman
,
he
stood
leaning
on
his
rifle
for
more
than
*NL*
a
minute
,
like
a
man
who
was
completely
buried
in
thought
.
From
this
*NL*
reverie
,
he
was
,
however
,
awakened
by
one
of
the
young
Indians
who
*NL*
had
furnished
the
arms
,
and
who
now
touched
his
shoulder
,
saying
in
*NL*
exceedingly
broken
English
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
the
pale
face
beat
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Huron
!
''
exclaimed
the
scout
,
raising
the
short
rifle
in
his
right
*NL*
hand
,
and
shaking
it
at
Magua
,
with
as
much
apparent
ease
as
if
it
were
*NL*
a
reed
;
``
yes
,
Huron
,
I
could
strike
you
now
,
and
no
power
on
earth
could
*NL*
prevent
the
deed
!
The
soaring
hawk
is
not
more
certain
of
the
dove
than
*NL*
I
am
this
moment
of
you
,
did
I
choose
to
send
a
bullet
to
your
heart
!
*NL*
Why
should
I
not
?
Why
!
--
because
the
gifts
of
my
color
forbid
it
,
and
I
*NL*
might
draw
down
evil
on
tender
and
innocent
heads
.
If
you
know
such
a
*NL*
being
as
God
,
thank
Him
,
therefore
,
in
your
inward
soul
;
for
you
have
*NL*
reason
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
flushed
countenance
,
angry
eye
and
swelling
figure
of
the
scout
,
*NL*
produced
a
sensation
of
secret
awe
in
all
that
heard
him
.
The
Delawares
*NL*
held
their
breath
in
expectation
;
but
Magua
himself
,
even
while
he
*NL*
distrusted
the
forbearance
of
his
enemy
,
remained
immovable
and
calm
,
*NL*
where
he
stood
wedged
in
by
the
crowd
,
as
one
who
grew
to
the
spot
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Beat
it
,
''
repeated
the
young
Delaware
at
the
elbow
of
the
scout
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Beat
what
,
fool
!
--
what
?
''
exclaimed
Hawkeye
,
still
flourishing
the
*NL*
weapon
angrily
above
his
head
,
though
his
eye
no
longer
sought
the
*NL*
person
of
Magua
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
the
white
man
is
the
warrior
he
pretends
,
''
said
the
aged
chief
,
``
let
*NL*
him
strike
nigher
to
the
mark
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
scout
laughed
aloud
--
a
noise
that
produced
the
startling
effect
of
*NL*
an
unnatural
sound
on
Heyward
;
then
dropping
the
piece
,
heavily
,
into
*NL*
his
extended
left
hand
,
it
was
discharged
,
apparently
by
the
shock
,
*NL*
driving
the
fragments
of
the
vessel
into
the
air
,
and
scattering
them
on
*NL*
every
side
.
Almost
at
the
same
instant
,
the
rattling
sound
of
the
rifle
*NL*
was
heard
,
as
he
suffered
it
to
fall
,
contemptuously
,
to
the
earth
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
impression
of
so
strange
a
scene
was
engrossing
admiration
.
*NL*
Then
a
low
,
but
increasing
murmur
,
ran
through
the
multitude
,
and
*NL*
finally
swelled
into
sounds
that
denoted
a
lively
opposition
in
*NL*
the
sentiments
of
the
spectators
.
While
some
openly
testified
their
*NL*
satisfaction
at
so
unexampled
dexterity
,
by
far
the
larger
portion
*NL*
of
the
tribe
were
inclined
to
believe
the
success
of
the
shot
was
the
*NL*
result
of
accident
.
Heyward
was
not
slow
to
confirm
an
opinion
that
was
*NL*
so
favorable
to
his
own
pretensions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
chance
!
''
he
exclaimed
;
``
none
can
shoot
without
an
aim
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Chance
!
''
echoed
the
excited
woodsman
,
who
was
now
stubbornly
bent
on
*NL*
maintaining
his
identity
at
every
hazard
,
and
on
whom
the
secret
hints
*NL*
of
Heyward
to
acquiesce
in
the
deception
were
entirely
lost
.
``
Does
*NL*
yonder
lying
Huron
,
too
,
think
it
chance
?
Give
him
another
gun
,
and
*NL*
place
us
face
to
face
,
without
cover
or
dodge
,
and
let
Providence
,
and
*NL*
our
own
eyes
,
decide
the
matter
atween
us
!
I
do
not
make
the
offer
,
to
*NL*
you
,
major
;
for
our
blood
is
of
a
color
,
and
we
serve
the
same
master
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
the
Huron
is
a
liar
,
is
very
evident
,
''
returned
Heyward
,
coolly
;
*NL*
``
you
have
yourself
heard
him
assert
you
to
be
La
Longue
Carabine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
were
impossible
to
say
what
violent
assertion
the
stubborn
Hawkeye
*NL*
would
have
next
made
,
in
his
headlong
wish
to
vindicate
his
identity
,
*NL*
had
not
the
aged
Delaware
once
more
interposed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
hawk
which
comes
from
the
clouds
can
return
when
he
will
,
''
he
said
;
*NL*
``
give
them
the
guns
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
time
the
scout
seized
the
rifle
with
avidity
;
nor
had
Magua
,
though
*NL*
he
watched
the
movements
of
the
marksman
with
jealous
eyes
,
any
further
*NL*
cause
for
apprehension

*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
let
it
be
proved
,
in
the
face
of
this
tribe
of
Delawares
,
which
*NL*
is
the
better
man
,
''
cried
the
scout
,
tapping
the
butt
of
his
piece
with
*NL*
that
finger
which
had
pulled
so
many
fatal
triggers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
that
gourd
hanging
against
yonder
tree
,
major
;
if
you
are
a
*NL*
marksman
fit
for
the
borders
,
let
me
see
you
break
its
shell
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Duncan
noted
the
object
,
and
prepared
himself
to
renew
the
trial
.
The
*NL*
gourd
was
one
of
the
usual
little
vessels
used
by
the
Indians
,
and
*NL*
it
was
suspended
from
a
dead
branch
of
a
small
pine
,
by
a
thong
*NL*
of
deerskin
,
at
the
full
distance
of
a
hundred
yards
.
So
strangely
*NL*
compounded
is
the
feeling
of
self-love
,
that
the
young
soldier
,
while
*NL*
he
knew
the
utter
worthlessness
of
the
suffrages
of
his
savage
umpires
,
*NL*
forgot
the
sudden
motives
of
the
contest
in
a
wish
to
excel
.
It
had
been
*NL*
seen
,
already
,
that
his
skill
was
far
from
being
contemptible
,
and
he
*NL*
now
resolved
to
put
forth
its
nicest
qualities
.
Had
his
life
depended
*NL*
on
the
issue
,
the
aim
of
Duncan
could
not
have
been
more
deliberate
or
*NL*
guarded
.
He
fired
;
and
three
or
four
young
Indians
,
who
sprang
forward
*NL*
at
the
report
,
announced
with
a
shout
,
that
the
ball
was
in
the
tree
,
*NL*
a
very
little
on
one
side
of
the
proper
object
.
The
warriors
uttered
a
*NL*
common
ejaculation
of
pleasure
,
and
then
turned
their
eyes
,
inquiringly
,
*NL*
on
the
movements
of
his
rival
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
may
do
for
the
Royal
Americans
!
''
said
Hawkeye
,
laughing
once
more
in
*NL*
his
own
silent
,
heartfelt
manner
;
``
but
had
my
gun
often
turned
so
much
*NL*
from
the
true
line
,
many
a
marten
,
whose
skin
is
now
in
a
lady
's
muff
,
*NL*
would
still
be
in
the
woods
;
ay
,
and
many
a
bloody
Mingo
,
who
has
*NL*
departed
to
his
final
account
,
would
be
acting
his
deviltries
at
this
*NL*
very
day
,
atween
the
provinces
.
I
hope
the
squaw
who
owns
the
gourd
has
*NL*
more
of
them
in
her
wigwam
,
for
this
will
never
hold
water
again
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
scout
had
shook
his
priming
,
and
cocked
his
piece
,
while
speaking
;
*NL*
and
,
as
he
ended
,
he
threw
back
a
foot
,
and
slowly
raised
the
muzzle
*NL*
from
the
earth
:
the
motion
was
steady
,
uniform
,
and
in
one
direction
.
*NL*
When
on
a
perfect
level
,
it
remained
for
a
single
moment
,
without
tremor
*NL*
or
variation
,
as
though
both
man
and
rifle
were
carved
in
stone
.
During
*NL*
that
stationary
instant
,
it
poured
forth
its
contents
,
in
a
bright
,
*NL*
glancing
sheet
of
flame
.
Again
the
young
Indians
bounded
forward
;
but
*NL*
their
hurried
search
and
disappointed
looks
announced
that
no
traces
of
*NL*
the
bullet
were
to
be
seen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
!
''
said
the
old
chief
to
the
scout
,
in
a
tone
of
strong
disgust
;
*NL*
``
thou
art
a
wolf
in
the
skin
of
a
dog
.
I
will
talk
to
the
`
Long
Rifle
'
*NL*
of
the
Yengeese
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
had
I
that
piece
which
furnished
the
name
you
use
,
I
would
obligate
*NL*
myself
to
cut
the
thong
,
and
drop
the
gourd
without
breaking
it
!
''
*NL*
returned
Hawkeye
,
perfectly
undisturbed
by
the
other
's
manner
.
``
Fools
,
*NL*
if
you
would
find
the
bullet
of
a
sharpshooter
in
these
woods
,
you
must
*NL*
look
in
the
object
,
and
not
around
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Indian
youths
instantly
comprehended
his
meaning
--
for
this
time
he
*NL*
spoke
in
the
Delaware
tongue
--
and
tearing
the
gourd
from
the
tree
,
they
*NL*
held
it
on
high
with
an
exulting
shout
,
displaying
a
hole
in
its
bottom
,
*NL*
which
had
been
cut
by
the
bullet
,
after
passing
through
the
usual
*NL*
orifice
in
the
center
of
its
upper
side
.
At
this
unexpected
exhibition
,
*NL*
a
loud
and
vehement
expression
of
pleasure
burst
from
the
mouth
of
every
*NL*
warrior
present
.
It
decided
the
question
,
and
effectually
established
*NL*
Hawkeye
in
the
possession
of
his
dangerous
reputation
.
Those
curious
*NL*
and
admiring
eyes
which
had
been
turned
again
on
Heyward
,
were
finally
*NL*
directed
to
the
weather-beaten
form
of
the
scout
,
who
immediately
became
*NL*
the
principal
object
of
attention
to
the
simple
and
unsophisticated
*NL*
beings
by
whom
he
was
surrounded
.
When
the
sudden
and
noisy
commotion
*NL*
had
a
little
subsided
,
the
aged
chief
resumed
his
examination
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
did
you
wish
to
stop
my
ears
?
''
he
said
,
addressing
Duncan
;
``
are
*NL*
the
Delawares
fools
that
they
could
not
know
the
young
panther
from
the
*NL*
cat
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
will
yet
find
the
Huron
a
singing-bird
,
''
said
Duncan
,
endeavoring
*NL*
to
adopt
the
figurative
language
of
the
natives
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
good
.
We
will
know
who
can
shut
the
ears
of
men
.
Brother
,
''
added
*NL*
the
chief
turning
his
eyes
on
Magua
,
``
the
Delawares
listen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
singled
,
and
directly
called
on
to
declare
his
object
,
the
Huron
*NL*
arose
;
and
advancing
with
great
deliberation
and
dignity
into
the
very
*NL*
center
of
the
circle
,
where
he
stood
confronted
by
the
prisoners
,
*NL*
he
placed
himself
in
an
attitude
to
speak
.
Before
opening
his
mouth
,
*NL*
however
,
he
bent
his
eyes
slowly
along
the
whole
living
boundary
of
*NL*
earnest
faces
,
as
if
to
temper
his
expressions
to
the
capacities
of
his
*NL*
audience
.
On
Hawkeye
he
cast
a
glance
of
respectful
enmity
;
on
Duncan
,
*NL*
a
look
of
inextinguishable
hatred
;
the
shrinking
figure
of
Alice
*NL*
he
scarcely
deigned
to
notice
;
but
when
his
glance
met
the
firm
,
*NL*
commanding
,
and
yet
lovely
form
of
Cora
,
his
eye
lingered
a
moment
,
with
*NL*
an
expression
that
it
might
have
been
difficult
to
define
.
Then
,
filled
*NL*
with
his
own
dark
intentions
,
he
spoke
in
the
language
of
the
Canadas
,
a
*NL*
tongue
that
he
well
knew
was
comprehended
by
most
of
his
auditors
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Spirit
that
made
men
colored
them
differently
,
''
commenced
the
*NL*
subtle
Huron
.
``
Some
are
blacker
than
the
sluggish
bear
.
These
He
said
*NL*
should
be
slaves
;
and
He
ordered
them
to
work
forever
,
like
the
beaver
.
*NL*
You
may
hear
them
groan
,
when
the
south
wind
blows
,
louder
than
the
*NL*
lowing
buffaloes
,
along
the
shores
of
the
great
salt
lake
,
where
the
big
*NL*
canoes
come
and
go
with
them
in
droves
.
Some
He
made
with
faces
paler
*NL*
than
the
ermine
of
the
forests
;
and
these
He
ordered
to
be
traders
;
*NL*
dogs
to
their
women
,
and
wolves
to
their
slaves
.
He
gave
this
people
the
*NL*
nature
of
the
pigeon
;
wings
that
never
tire
;
young
,
more
plentiful
than
*NL*
the
leaves
on
the
trees
,
and
appetites
to
devour
the
earth
.
He
gave
them
*NL*
tongues
like
the
false
call
of
the
wildcat
;
hearts
like
rabbits
;
the
*NL*
cunning
of
the
hog
-LRB-
but
none
of
the
fox
-RRB-
,
and
arms
longer
than
the
legs
*NL*
of
the
moose
.
With
his
tongue
he
stops
the
ears
of
the
Indians
;
his
*NL*
heart
teaches
him
to
pay
warriors
to
fight
his
battles
;
his
cunning
*NL*
tells
him
how
to
get
together
the
goods
of
the
earth
;
and
his
arms
*NL*
inclose
the
land
from
the
shores
of
the
salt-water
to
the
islands
of
the
*NL*
great
lake
.
His
gluttony
makes
him
sick
.
God
gave
him
enough
,
and
yet
he
*NL*
wants
all
.
Such
are
the
pale
faces
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Some
the
Great
Spirit
made
with
skins
brighter
and
redder
than
yonder
*NL*
sun
,
''
continued
Magua
,
pointing
impressively
upward
to
the
lurid
*NL*
luminary
,
which
was
struggling
through
the
misty
atmosphere
of
the
*NL*
horizon
;
``
and
these
did
He
fashion
to
His
own
mind
.
He
gave
them
this
*NL*
island
as
He
had
made
it
,
covered
with
trees
,
and
filled
with
game
.
The
*NL*
wind
made
their
clearings
;
the
sun
and
rain
ripened
their
fruits
;
and
*NL*
the
snows
came
to
tell
them
to
be
thankful
.
What
need
had
they
of
roads
*NL*
to
journey
by
!
They
saw
through
the
hills
!
When
the
beavers
worked
,
they
*NL*
lay
in
the
shade
,
and
looked
on
.
The
winds
cooled
them
in
summer
;
in
*NL*
winter
,
skins
kept
them
warm
.
If
they
fought
among
themselves
,
it
was
*NL*
to
prove
that
they
were
men
.
They
were
brave
;
they
were
just
;
they
were
*NL*
happy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
the
speaker
paused
,
and
again
looked
around
him
to
discover
if
his
*NL*
legend
had
touched
the
sympathies
of
his
listeners
.
He
met
everywhere
,
*NL*
with
eyes
riveted
on
his
own
,
heads
erect
and
nostrils
expanded
,
as
*NL*
if
each
individual
present
felt
himself
able
and
willing
,
singly
,
to
*NL*
redress
the
wrongs
of
his
race
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
the
Great
Spirit
gave
different
tongues
to
his
red
children
,
''
he
*NL*
continued
,
in
a
low
,
still
melancholy
voice
,
``
it
was
that
all
animals
*NL*
might
understand
them
.
Some
He
placed
among
the
snows
,
with
their
*NL*
cousin
,
the
bear
.
Some
he
placed
near
the
setting
sun
,
on
the
road
to
*NL*
the
happy
hunting
grounds
.
Some
on
the
lands
around
the
great
fresh
*NL*
waters
;
but
to
His
greatest
,
and
most
beloved
,
He
gave
the
sands
of
the
*NL*
salt
lake
.
Do
my
brothers
know
the
name
of
this
favored
people
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
the
Lenape
!
''
exclaimed
twenty
eager
voices
in
a
breath
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
the
Lenni
Lenape
,
''
returned
Magua
,
affecting
to
bend
his
head
in
*NL*
reverence
to
their
former
greatness
.
``
It
was
the
tribes
of
the
Lenape
!
*NL*
The
sun
rose
from
water
that
was
salt
,
and
set
in
water
that
was
sweet
,
*NL*
and
never
hid
himself
from
their
eyes
.
But
why
should
I
,
a
Huron
of
the
*NL*
woods
,
tell
a
wise
people
their
own
traditions
?
Why
remind
them
of
*NL*
their
injuries
;
their
ancient
greatness
;
their
deeds
;
their
glory
;
their
*NL*
happiness
;
their
losses
;
their
defeats
;
their
misery
?
Is
there
not
one
*NL*
among
them
who
has
seen
it
all
,
and
who
knows
it
to
be
true
?
I
have
*NL*
done
.
My
tongue
is
still
for
my
heart
is
of
lead
.
I
listen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
voice
of
the
speaker
suddenly
ceased
,
every
face
and
all
eyes
*NL*
turned
,
by
a
common
movement
,
toward
the
venerable
Tamenund
.
From
the
*NL*
moment
that
he
took
his
seat
,
until
the
present
instant
,
the
lips
of
the
*NL*
patriarch
had
not
severed
,
and
scarcely
a
sign
of
life
had
escaped
him
.
*NL*
He
sat
bent
in
feebleness
,
and
apparently
unconscious
of
the
presence
*NL*
he
was
in
,
during
the
whole
of
that
opening
scene
,
in
which
the
skill
of
*NL*
the
scout
had
been
so
clearly
established
.
At
the
nicely
graduated
sound
*NL*
of
Magua
's
voice
,
however
,
he
betrayed
some
evidence
of
consciousness
,
*NL*
and
once
or
twice
he
even
raised
his
head
,
as
if
to
listen
.
But
when
*NL*
the
crafty
Huron
spoke
of
his
nation
by
name
,
the
eyelids
of
the
old
man
*NL*
raised
themselves
,
and
he
looked
out
upon
the
multitude
with
that
sort
*NL*
of
dull
,
unmeaning
expression
which
might
be
supposed
to
belong
to
the
*NL*
countenance
of
a
specter
.
Then
he
made
an
effort
to
rise
,
and
being
*NL*
upheld
by
his
supporters
,
he
gained
his
feet
,
in
a
posture
commanding
by
*NL*
its
dignity
,
while
he
tottered
with
weakness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
calls
upon
the
children
of
the
Lenape
?
''
he
said
,
in
a
deep
,
*NL*
guttural
voice
,
that
was
rendered
awfully
audible
by
the
breathless
*NL*
silence
of
the
multitude
;
``
who
speaks
of
things
gone
?
Does
not
the
egg
*NL*
become
a
worm
--
the
worm
a
fly
,
and
perish
?
Why
tell
the
Delawares
of
*NL*
good
that
is
past
?
Better
thank
the
Manitou
for
that
which
remains
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
Wyandot
,
''
said
Magua
,
stepping
nigher
to
the
rude
platform
on
*NL*
which
the
other
stood
;
``
a
friend
of
Tamenund
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
friend
!
''
repeated
the
sage
,
on
whose
brow
a
dark
frown
settled
,
*NL*
imparting
a
portion
of
that
severity
which
had
rendered
his
eye
so
*NL*
terrible
in
middle
age
.
``
Are
the
Mingoes
rulers
of
the
earth
?
What
*NL*
brings
a
Huron
in
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Justice
.
His
prisoners
are
with
his
brothers
,
and
he
comes
for
his
*NL*
own
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tamenund
turned
his
head
toward
one
of
his
supporters
,
and
listened
to
*NL*
the
short
explanation
the
man
gave
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
facing
the
applicant
,
he
regarded
him
a
moment
with
deep
*NL*
attention
;
after
which
he
said
,
in
a
low
and
reluctant
voice
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Justice
is
the
law
of
the
great
Manitou
.
My
children
,
give
the
stranger
*NL*
food
.
Then
,
Huron
,
take
thine
own
and
depart
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
delivery
of
this
solemn
judgment
,
the
patriarch
seated
himself
,
*NL*
and
closed
his
eyes
again
,
as
if
better
pleased
with
the
images
of
*NL*
his
own
ripened
experience
than
with
the
visible
objects
of
the
world
.
*NL*
Against
such
a
decree
there
was
no
Delaware
sufficiently
hardy
to
*NL*
murmur
,
much
less
oppose
himself
.
The
words
were
barely
uttered
when
*NL*
four
or
five
of
the
younger
warriors
,
stepping
behind
Heyward
and
the
*NL*
scout
,
passed
thongs
so
dexterously
and
rapidly
around
their
arms
,
as
*NL*
to
hold
them
both
in
instant
bondage
.
The
former
was
too
much
engrossed
*NL*
with
his
precious
and
nearly
insensible
burden
,
to
be
aware
of
their
*NL*
intentions
before
they
were
executed
;
and
the
latter
,
who
considered
*NL*
even
the
hostile
tribes
of
the
Delawares
a
superior
race
of
beings
,
*NL*
submitted
without
resistance
.
Perhaps
,
however
,
the
manner
of
the
scout
*NL*
would
not
have
been
so
passive
,
had
he
fully
comprehended
the
language
*NL*
in
which
the
preceding
dialogue
had
been
conducted
.
*NL*
*NL*
Magua
cast
a
look
of
triumph
around
the
whole
assembly
before
he
*NL*
proceeded
to
the
execution
of
his
purpose
.
Perceiving
that
the
men
were
*NL*
unable
to
offer
any
resistance
,
he
turned
his
looks
on
her
he
valued
*NL*
most
.
Cora
met
his
gaze
with
an
eye
so
calm
and
firm
,
that
his
*NL*
resolution
wavered
.
Then
,
recollecting
his
former
artifice
,
he
raised
*NL*
Alice
from
the
arms
of
the
warrior
against
whom
she
leaned
,
and
*NL*
beckoning
Heyward
to
follow
,
he
motioned
for
the
encircling
crowd
to
*NL*
open
.
But
Cora
,
instead
of
obeying
the
impulse
he
had
expected
,
rushed
*NL*
to
the
feet
of
the
patriarch
,
and
,
raising
her
voice
,
exclaimed
aloud
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
and
venerable
Delaware
,
on
thy
wisdom
and
power
we
lean
for
mercy
!
*NL*
Be
deaf
to
yonder
artful
and
remorseless
monster
,
who
poisons
thy
ears
*NL*
with
falsehoods
to
feed
his
thirst
for
blood
.
Thou
that
hast
lived
long
,
*NL*
and
that
hast
seen
the
evil
of
the
world
,
should
know
how
to
temper
its
*NL*
calamities
to
the
miserable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
eyes
of
the
old
man
opened
heavily
,
and
he
once
more
looked
upward
*NL*
at
the
multitude
.
As
the
piercing
tones
of
the
suppliant
swelled
on
*NL*
his
ears
,
they
moved
slowly
in
the
direction
of
her
person
,
and
finally
*NL*
settled
there
in
a
steady
gaze
.
Cora
had
cast
herself
to
her
knees
;
*NL*
and
,
with
hands
clenched
in
each
other
and
pressed
upon
her
bosom
,
she
*NL*
remained
like
a
beauteous
and
breathing
model
of
her
sex
,
looking
up
in
*NL*
his
faded
but
majestic
countenance
,
with
a
species
of
holy
reverence
.
*NL*
Gradually
the
expression
of
Tamenund
's
features
changed
,
and
losing
*NL*
their
vacancy
in
admiration
,
they
lighted
with
a
portion
of
that
*NL*
intelligence
which
a
century
before
had
been
wont
to
communicate
his
*NL*
youthful
fire
to
the
extensive
bands
of
the
Delawares
.
Rising
without
*NL*
assistance
,
and
seemingly
without
an
effort
,
he
demanded
,
in
a
voice
*NL*
that
startled
its
auditors
by
its
firmness
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
art
thou
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
woman
.
One
of
a
hated
race
,
if
thou
wilt
--
a
Yengee
.
But
one
who
has
*NL*
never
harmed
thee
,
and
who
can
not
harm
thy
people
,
if
she
would
;
who
*NL*
asks
for
succor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
,
my
children
,
''
continued
the
patriarch
,
hoarsely
,
motioning
to
*NL*
those
around
him
,
though
his
eyes
still
dwelt
upon
the
kneeling
form
of
*NL*
Cora
,
``
where
have
the
Delawares
camped
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
mountains
of
the
Iroquois
,
beyond
the
clear
springs
of
the
*NL*
Horican
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Many
parching
summers
are
come
and
gone
,
''
continued
the
sage
,
``
since
*NL*
I
drank
of
the
water
of
my
own
rivers
.
The
children
of
Minquon
*
are
the
*NL*
justest
white
men
,
but
they
were
thirsty
and
they
took
it
to
themselves
.
*NL*
Do
they
follow
us
so
far
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
*
William
Penn
was
termed
Minquon
by
the
Delawares
,
and
,
as
*NL*
he
never
used
violence
or
injustice
in
his
dealings
with
*NL*
them
,
his
reputation
for
probity
passed
into
a
proverb
.
The
*NL*
American
is
justly
proud
of
the
origin
of
his
nation
,
which
*NL*
is
perhaps
unequaled
in
the
history
of
the
world
;
but
the
*NL*
Pennsylvanian
and
Jerseyman
have
more
reason
to
value
*NL*
themselves
in
their
ancestors
than
the
natives
of
any
other
*NL*
state
,
since
no
wrong
was
done
the
original
owners
of
the
*NL*
soil
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
follow
none
,
we
covet
nothing
,
''
answered
Cora
.
``
Captives
against
our
*NL*
wills
,
have
we
been
brought
amongst
you
;
and
we
ask
but
permission
*NL*
to
depart
to
our
own
in
peace
.
Art
thou
not
Tamenund
--
the
father

the
*NL*
judge

almost
said

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

'T
is
now
some
seven
years

at

a
white
chief

the
borders

this
province

He
claimed
to
be
of
the
*NL*
blood

good

just
Tamenund

said
the
white
man

*NL*
``
I
remember

that
when
a
laughing
boy

returned
the
patriarch
,
with
the
*NL*
peculiar
recollection
of
vast
age
,
``
I
stood
upon
the
sands
of
the
sea

saw
a
big
canoe

whiter
than

wider
*NL*

many
eagles

*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay

nay

I
speak
not

very
distant

of
mine

the
memory

thy
youngest
warrior

*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
it
when
the
Yengeese
and
the
Dutchmanne
fought
for
the
*NL*
hunting-grounds
of
the
Delawares

Then
Tamenund
was
a
chief
,

first
*NL*
laid
aside
the
bow
for
the
lightning
of
the
pale
faces

*NL*
*NL*
``
Not

interrupted
Cora
,
``

*NL*
``
It

yesterday

rejoined
the
aged
man
,
with
touching
pathos
,
*NL*
``

birds

beasts

*NL*
*NL*
Cora
bowed
her
head
in
disappointment
,
and
,
for
a
bitter
moment
*NL*
struggled
with
her
chagrin
.
Then
,
elevating
her
rich
features
and
*NL*
beaming
eyes
,
she
continued
,
in
tones
scarcely
less
penetrating
than
the
*NL*
unearthly
voice
of
the
patriarch
himself
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
,
is
Tamenund
a
father

*NL*
*NL*
The
old
man
looked
down
upon
her
from
his
elevated
stand
,
with
a
*NL*
benignant
smile
on
his
wasted
countenance
,
and
then
casting
his
eyes
*NL*
slowly
over
the
whole
assemblage
,
he
answered
:

*NL*
``
Of
a
nation

*NL*
*NL*
``
For
myself
I
ask
nothing

thee

she
*NL*
continued
,
pressing
her
hands
convulsively
on
her
heart
,
and
suffering
*NL*
her
head
to
droop
until
her
burning
cheeks
were
nearly
concealed
in
the
*NL*
maze
of
dark
,
glossy
tresses
that
fell
in
disorder
upon
her
shoulders
,
*NL*
``
the

has

to
have
the

that
the

color

better

continued
the
earnest
old
chieftain
,
without
heeding
the
*NL*
wounded
spirit
of
his
listener
,
whose
head
was
nearly
crushed
to
the
*NL*
earth
in
shame
,
as
he
proceeded
,
``
would
bark
and
caw
before
they
would
*NL*
take
a
woman
to
their
wigwams

blood
was
not
of
the
color
of
snow

*NL*
But
let
them
not
boast
before
the
face
of
the
Manitou
too
loud

They
*NL*
entered
the
land
at
the
rising
,
and
may
yet
go
off
at
the
setting
sun

*NL*
I
have
often
seen
the
locusts
strip
the
leaves
from
the
trees

the
*NL*
season
of
blossoms
has
always
come
again

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
so
,
''
said
Cora
,
drawing
a
long
breath
,
as
if
reviving
from
a
*NL*
trance
,
raising
her
face
,
and
shaking
back
her
shining
veil
,
with
*NL*
a
kindling
eye
,
that
contradicted
the
death-like
paleness
of
her
*NL*
countenance
;
``

why

it
is
not
permitted
us
to
inquire

There
is
yet

thou
lettest

speak

*NL*
*NL*
Observing
Tamenund
to
look
about
him
doubtingly
,
one
of
his
companions
*NL*
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is

torture

*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
him
come

returned
the
sage
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Tamenund
once
more
sank
into
his
seat
,
and
a
silence
so
deep
*NL*
prevailed
while
the
young
man
prepared
to
obey
his
simple
mandate
,
that
*NL*
the
leaves
,
which
fluttered
in
the
draught
of
the
light
morning
air

*NL*
were
distinctly
heard
rustling
in

``

is
no

*NL*
The
silence
continued
unbroken
by
human
sounds
for
many
anxious
minutes
.
*NL*
Then
the
waving
multitude
opened
and
shut
again
,
and
Uncas
stood
in
the
*NL*
living
circle
.
All
those
eyes
,
which
had
been
curiously
studying
the
*NL*
lineaments
of
the
sage
,
as
the
source
of
their
own
intelligence
,
turned
*NL*
on
the
instant
,
and
were
now
bent
in
secret
admiration
on
the
erect
,
*NL*
agile
,
and
faultless
person
of
the
captive
.
But
neither
the
presence
in
*NL*
which
he
found
himself
,
nor
the
exclusive
attention
that
he
attracted
,
*NL*
in
any
manner
disturbed
the
self-possession
of
the
young
Mohican
.
He
*NL*
cast
a
deliberate
and
observing
look
on
every
side
of
him
,
meeting
*NL*
the
settled
expression
of
hostility
that
lowered
in
the
visages
of
*NL*
the
chiefs
with
the
same
calmness
as
the
curious
gaze
of
the
attentive
*NL*
children
.
But
when
,
last
in
this
haughty
scrutiny
,
the
person
of
*NL*
Tamenund
came
under
his
glance
,
his
eye
became
fixed
,
as
though
all
*NL*
other
objects
were
already
forgotten
.
Then
,
advancing
with
a
slow
and
*NL*
noiseless
step
up
the
area
,
he
placed
himself
immediately
before
the
*NL*
footstool
of
the
sage
.
Here
he
stood
unnoted
,
though
keenly
observant
*NL*
himself
,
until
one
of
the
chiefs
apprised
the
latter
of
his
presence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
what
tongue
does
the
prisoner
speak
to
the
Manitou
?
''
demanded
the
*NL*
patriarch
,
without
unclosing
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Like
his
fathers
,
''
Uncas
replied
;
``
with
the
tongue
of
a
Delaware
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
sudden
and
unexpected
annunciation
,
a
low
,
fierce
yell
ran
*NL*
through
the
multitude
,
that
might
not
inaptly
be
compared
to
the
growl
*NL*
of
the
lion
,
as
his
choler
is
first
awakened
--
a
fearful
omen
of
the
*NL*
weight
of
his
future
anger
.
The
effect
was
equally
strong
on
the
sage
,
*NL*
though
differently
exhibited
.
He
passed
a
hand
before
his
eyes
,
as
if
*NL*
to
exclude
the
least
evidence
of
so
shameful
a
spectacle
,
while
he
*NL*
repeated
,
in
his
low
,
guttural
tones
,
the
words
he
had
just
heard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
Delaware
!
I
have
lived
to
see
the
tribes
of
the
Lenape
driven
from
*NL*
their
council-fires
,
and
scattered
,
like
broken
herds
of
deer
,
among
the
*NL*
hills
of
the
Iroquois
!
I
have
seen
the
hatchets
of
a
strong
people
sweep
*NL*
woods
from
the
valleys
,
that
the
winds
of
heaven
have
spared
!
The
beasts
*NL*
that
run
on
the
mountains
,
and
the
birds
that
fly
above
the
trees
,
have
*NL*
I
seen
living
in
the
wigwams
of
men
;
but
never
before
have
I
found
a
*NL*
Delaware
so
base
as
to
creep
,
like
a
poisonous
serpent
,
into
the
camps
*NL*
of
his
nation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
singing-birds
have
opened
their
bills
,
''
returned
Uncas
,
in
the
*NL*
softest
notes
of
his
own
musical
voice
;
``
and
Tamenund
has
heard
their
*NL*
song
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
sage
started
,
and
bent
his
head
aside
,
as
if
to
catch
the
fleeting
*NL*
sounds
of
some
passing
melody
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
Tamenund
dream
!
''
he
exclaimed
.
``
What
voice
is
at
his
ear
!
Have
*NL*
the
winters
gone
backward
!
Will
summer
come
again
to
the
children
of
the
*NL*
Lenape
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
solemn
and
respectful
silence
succeeded
this
incoherent
burst
from
*NL*
the
lips
of
the
Delaware
prophet
.
His
people
readily
constructed
his
*NL*
unintelligible
language
into
one
of
those
mysterious
conferences
he
was
*NL*
believed
to
hold
so
frequently
with
a
superior
intelligence
and
they
*NL*
awaited
the
issue
of
the
revelation
in
awe
.
After
a
patient
pause
,
*NL*
however
,
one
of
the
aged
men
,
perceiving
that
the
sage
had
lost
the
*NL*
recollection
of
the
subject
before
them
,
ventured
to
remind
him
again
of
*NL*
the
presence
of
the
prisoner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
false
Delaware
trembles
lest
he
should
hear
the
words
of
Tamenund
,
''
*NL*
he
said
.
''
'T
is
a
hound
that
howls
,
when
the
Yengeese
show
him
a
trail
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
ye
,
''
returned
Uncas
,
looking
sternly
around
him
,
``
are
dogs
that
*NL*
whine
,
when
the
Frenchman
casts
ye
the
offals
of
his
deer
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Twenty
knives
gleamed
in
the
air
,
and
as
many
warriors
sprang
to
their
*NL*
feet
,
at
this
biting
,
and
perhaps
merited
retort
;
but
a
motion
from
one
*NL*
of
the
chiefs
suppressed
the
outbreaking
of
their
tempers
,
and
restored
*NL*
the
appearance
of
quiet
.
The
task
might
probably
have
been
more
*NL*
difficult
,
had
not
a
movement
made
by
Tamenund
indicated
that
he
was
*NL*
again
about
to
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Delaware
!
''
resumed
the
sage
,
``
little
art
thou
worthy
of
thy
name
.
My
*NL*
people
have
not
seen
a
bright
sun
in
many
winters
;
and
the
warrior
who
*NL*
deserts
his
tribe
when
hid
in
clouds
is
doubly
a
traitor
.
The
law
of
the
*NL*
Manitou
is
just
.
It
is
so
;
while
the
rivers
run
and
the
mountains
stand
,
*NL*
while
the
blossoms
come
and
go
on
the
trees
,
it
must
be
so
.
He
is
thine
,
*NL*
my
children
;
deal
justly
by
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Not
a
limb
was
moved
,
nor
was
a
breath
drawn
louder
and
longer
than
*NL*
common
,
until
the
closing
syllable
of
this
final
decree
had
passed
the
*NL*
lips
of
Tamenund
.
Then
a
cry
of
vengeance
burst
at
once
,
as
it
might
be
,
*NL*
from
the
united
lips
of
the
nation
;
a
frightful
augury
of
their
ruthless
*NL*
intentions
.
In
the
midst
of
these
prolonged
and
savage
yells
,
a
chief
*NL*
proclaimed
,
in
a
high
voice
,
that
the
captive
was
condemned
to
endure
*NL*
the
dreadful
trial
of
torture
by
fire
.
The
circle
broke
its
order
,
and
*NL*
screams
of
delight
mingled
with
the
bustle
and
tumult
of
preparation
.
*NL*
Heyward
struggled
madly
with
his
captors
;
the
anxious
eye
of
Hawkeye
*NL*
began
to
look
around
him
,
with
an
expression
of
peculiar
earnestness
;
*NL*
and
Cora
again
threw
herself
at
the
feet
of
the
patriarch
,
once
more
a
*NL*
suppliant
for
mercy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Throughout
the
whole
of
these
trying
moments
,
Uncas
had
alone
preserved
*NL*
his
serenity
.
He
looked
on
the
preparations
with
a
steady
eye
,
and
when
*NL*
the
tormentors
came
to
seize
him
,
he
met
them
with
a
firm
and
upright
*NL*
attitude
.
One
among
them
,
if
possible
more
fierce
and
savage
than
his
*NL*
fellows
,
seized
the
hunting-shirt
of
the
young
warrior
,
and
at
a
single
*NL*
effort
tore
it
from
his
body
.
Then
,
with
a
yell
of
frantic
pleasure
,
*NL*
he
leaped
toward
his
unresisting
victim
and
prepared
to
lead
him
to
*NL*
the
stake
.
But
,
at
that
moment
,
when
he
appeared
most
a
stranger
to
the
*NL*
feelings
of
humanity
,
the
purpose
of
the
savage
was
arrested
as
suddenly
*NL*
as
if
a
supernatural
agency
had
interposed
in
the
behalf
of
Uncas
.
The
*NL*
eyeballs
of
the
Delaware
seemed
to
start
from
their
sockets
;
his
mouth
*NL*
opened
and
his
whole
form
became
frozen
in
an
attitude
of
amazement
.
*NL*
Raising
his
hand
with
a
slow
and
regulated
motion
,
he
pointed
with
a
*NL*
finger
to
the
bosom
of
the
captive
.
His
companions
crowded
about
him
in
*NL*
wonder
and
every
eye
was
like
his
own
,
fastened
intently
on
the
figure
*NL*
of
a
small
tortoise
,
beautifully
tattooed
on
the
breast
of
the
prisoner
,
*NL*
in
a
bright
blue
tint
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
single
instant
Uncas
enjoyed
his
triumph
,
smiling
calmly
on
the
*NL*
scene
.
Then
motioning
the
crowd
away
with
a
high
and
haughty
sweep
of
*NL*
his
arm
,
he
advanced
in
front
of
the
nation
with
the
air
of
a
king
,
and
*NL*
spoke
in
a
voice
louder
than
the
murmur
of
admiration
that
ran
through
*NL*
the
multitude
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Men
of
the
Lenni
Lenape
!
''
he
said
,
``
my
race
upholds
the
earth
!
Your
*NL*
feeble
tribe
stands
on
my
shell
!
What
fire
that
a
Delaware
can
light
*NL*
would
burn
the
child
of
my
fathers
,
''
he
added
,
pointing
proudly
to
the
*NL*
simple
blazonry
on
his
skin
;
``
the
blood
that
came
from
such
a
stock
*NL*
would
smother
your
flames
!
My
race
is
the
grandfather
of
nations
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
art
thou
?
''
demanded
Tamenund
,
rising
at
the
startling
tones
*NL*
he
heard
,
more
than
at
any
meaning
conveyed
by
the
language
of
the
*NL*
prisoner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Uncas
,
the
son
of
Chingachgook
,
''
answered
the
captive
modestly
,
turning
*NL*
from
the
nation
,
and
bending
his
head
in
reverence
to
the
other
's
*NL*
character
and
years
;
``
a
son
of
the
great
Unamis
.
''
*
*NL*
*NL*
*
Turtle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
hour
of
Tamenund
is
nigh
!
''
exclaimed
the
sage
;
``
the
day
is
come
,
*NL*
at
last
,
to
the
night
!
I
thank
the
Manitou
,
that
one
is
here
to
fill
my
*NL*
place
at
the
council-fire
.
Uncas
,
the
child
of
Uncas
,
is
found
!
Let
the
*NL*
eyes
of
a
dying
eagle
gaze
on
the
rising
sun
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
stepped
lightly
,
but
proudly
on
the
platform
,
where
he
became
*NL*
visible
to
the
whole
agitated
and
wondering
multitude
.
Tamenund
held
him
*NL*
long
at
the
length
of
his
arm
and
read
every
turn
in
the
fine
lineaments
*NL*
of
his
countenance
,
with
the
untiring
gaze
of
one
who
recalled
days
of
*NL*
happiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
Tamenund
a
boy
?
''
at
length
the
bewildered
prophet
exclaimed
.
``
Have
*NL*
I
dreamed
of
so
many
snows
--
that
my
people
were
scattered
like
floating
*NL*
sands
--
of
Yengeese
,
more
plenty
than
the
leaves
on
the
trees
!
The
arrow
*NL*
of
Tamenund
would
not
frighten
the
fawn
;
his
arm
is
withered
like
the
*NL*
branch
of
a
dead
oak
;
the
snail
would
be
swifter
in
the
race
;
yet
is
*NL*
Uncas
before
him
as
they
went
to
battle
against
the
pale
faces
!
Uncas
,
*NL*
the
panther
of
his
tribe
,
the
eldest
son
of
the
Lenape
,
the
wisest
*NL*
Sagamore
of
the
Mohicans
!
Tell
me
,
ye
Delawares
,
has
Tamenund
been
a
*NL*
sleeper
for
a
hundred
winters
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
calm
and
deep
silence
which
succeeded
these
words
sufficiently
*NL*
announced
the
awful
reverence
with
which
his
people
received
the
*NL*
communication
of
the
patriarch
.
None
dared
to
answer
,
though
all
*NL*
listened
in
breathless
expectation
of
what
might
follow
.
Uncas
,
however
,
*NL*
looking
in
his
face
with
the
fondness
and
veneration
of
a
favored
child
,
*NL*
presumed
on
his
own
high
and
acknowledged
rank
,
to
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Four
warriors
of
his
race
have
lived
and
died
,
''
he
said
,
``
since
the
*NL*
friend
of
Tamenund
led
his
people
in
battle
.
The
blood
of
the
turtle
has
*NL*
been
in
many
chiefs
,
but
all
have
gone
back
into
the
earth
from
whence
*NL*
they
came
,
except
Chingachgook
and
his
son
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
true
--
it
is
true
,
''
returned
the
sage
,
a
flash
of
recollection
*NL*
destroying
all
his
pleasing
fancies
,
and
restoring
him
at
once
to
a
*NL*
consciousness
of
the
true
history
of
his
nation
.
``
Our
wise
men
have
*NL*
often
said
that
two
warriors
of
the
unchanged
race
were
in
the
hills
of
*NL*
the
Yengeese
;
why
have
their
seats
at
the
council-fires
of
the
Delawares
*NL*
been
so
long
empty
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
these
words
the
young
man
raised
his
head
,
which
he
had
still
kept
*NL*
bowed
a
little
,
in
reverence
;
and
lifting
his
voice
so
as
to
be
heard
*NL*
by
the
multitude
,
as
if
to
explain
at
once
and
forever
the
policy
of
his
*NL*
family
,
he
said
aloud
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Once
we
slept
where
we
could
hear
the
salt
lake
speak
in
its
anger
.
*NL*
Then
we
were
rulers
and
Sagamores
over
the
land
.
But
when
a
pale
face
*NL*
was
seen
on
every
brook
,
we
followed
the
deer
back
to
the
river
of
our
*NL*
nation
.
The
Delawares
were
gone
.
Few
warriors
of
them
all
stayed
to
*NL*
drink
of
the
stream
they
loved
.
Then
said
my
fathers
,
`
Here
will
we
*NL*
hunt
.
The
waters
of
the
river
go
into
the
salt
lake
.
If
we
go
toward
*NL*
the
setting
sun
,
we
shall
find
streams
that
run
into
the
great
lakes
of
*NL*
sweet
water
;
there
would
a
Mohican
die
,
like
fishes
of
the
sea
,
in
the
*NL*
clear
springs
.
When
the
Manitou
is
ready
and
shall
say
``
Come
,
''
we
will
*NL*
follow
the
river
to
the
sea
,
and
take
our
own
again
.
'
Such
,
Delawares
,
*NL*
is
the
belief
of
the
children
of
the
Turtle
.
Our
eyes
are
on
the
rising
*NL*
and
not
toward
the
setting
sun
.
We
know
whence
he
comes
,
but
we
know
not
*NL*
whither
he
goes
.
It
is
enough
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
men
of
the
Lenape
listened
to
his
words
with
all
the
respect
that
*NL*
superstition
could
lend
,
finding
a
secret
charm
even
in
the
figurative
*NL*
language
with
which
the
young
Sagamore
imparted
his
ideas
.
Uncas
himself
*NL*
watched
the
effect
of
his
brief
explanation
with
intelligent
eyes
,
and
*NL*
gradually
dropped
the
air
of
authority
he
had
assumed
,
as
he
perceived
*NL*
that
his
auditors
were
content
.
Then
,
permitting
his
looks
to
wander
*NL*
over
the
silent
throng
that
crowded
around
the
elevated
seat
of
*NL*
Tamenund
,
he
first
perceived
Hawkeye
in
his
bonds
.
Stepping
eagerly
*NL*
from
his
stand
,
he
made
way
for
himself
to
the
side
of
his
friend
;
and
*NL*
cutting
his
thongs
with
a
quick
and
angry
stroke
of
his
own
knife
,
he
*NL*
motioned
to
the
crowd
to
divide
.
The
Indians
silently
obeyed
,
and
once
*NL*
more
they
stood
ranged
in
their
circle
,
as
before
his
appearance
among
*NL*
them
.
Uncas
took
the
scout
by
the
hand
,
and
led
him
to
the
feet
of
the
*NL*
patriarch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Father
,
''
he
said
,
``
look
at
this
pale
face
;
a
just
man
,
and
the
friend
*NL*
of
the
Delawares
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
he
a
son
of
Minquon
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
so
;
a
warrior
known
to
the
Yengeese
,
and
feared
by
the
Maquas

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
name
has
he
gained
by
his
deeds
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
call
him
Hawkeye

''
Uncas
replied
,
using
the
Delaware
phrase
;
``
for
*NL*
his
sight
never
fails
.
The
Mingoes
know
him
better
by
the
death
he
gives
*NL*
their
warriors
;
with
them
he
is
`
The
Long
Rifle

.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
La
Longue

''
exclaimed
Tamenund
,
opening
his
eyes
,
and
*NL*
regarding
the
scout
sternly
.
``
My
son
has
not
done
well
to
call
him

friend

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
call
him
so
who
proves
himself
such

''
returned
the
young
chief
,
with
*NL*
great
calmness
,
but
with
a
steady
mien
.
``
If
Uncas
is
welcome
among
the
*NL*
Delawares

is
Hawkeye

``

blows

has
struck

Lenape
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
If
a
Mingo
has
whispered
that
much
in
the
ear
of
the
Delaware
,
he
has
*NL*
only
shown
that
he
is
a
singing-bird
,
''
said
the
scout
,
who
now
believed
*NL*
that
it
was
time
to
vindicate
himself
from
such
offensive
charges
,
*NL*
and
who
spoke
as
the
man
he
addressed
,
modifying
his
Indian
figures
,
*NL*
however
,
with
his
own
peculiar
notions
.
``
That
I
have
slain
the
Maquas
*NL*
I
am
not
the
man
to
deny
,
even
at
their
own
council-fires
;
but
that
,
*NL*
knowingly
,
my
hand
has
never
harmed
a
Delaware

is
opposed
to
the
reason
*NL*
of
my
gifts
,
which
is
friendly
to
them
,
and
all
that
belongs
to
their
*NL*
nation

''
*NL*
*NL*
A
low
exclamation
of
applause
passed
among
the
warriors
who
exchanged
*NL*
looks
with
each
other
like
men
that
first
began
to
perceive
their
error
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
is
the
Huron
?
''
demanded
Tamenund
.
``
Has
he
stopped
my
ears

*NL*
*NL*
Magua
,
whose
feelings
during
that
scene
in
which
Uncas
had
triumphed
may
*NL*
be
much
better
imagined
than
described
,
answered
to
the
call
by
stepping
*NL*
boldly
in
front
of
the
patriarch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
just
Tamenund

*NL*
``

returned
the

avoiding

dark

turning
gladly
to
the
more
ingenuous

no

*NL*

repeated

Tamenund

gravely

*NL*

his

at

turned
from

in
sorrow

*NL*
A
short
and
impressive
pause
succeeded
,
during
which
it
was
very
*NL*
apparent
with
what
reluctance
the
multitude
admitted
the
justice
of
the
*NL*
Mingo
's
claim
.
At
length
the
sage
,
on
whom
alone
the
decision
depended
,
*NL*
said
,
in
a
firm
voice
:
*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
As
he
came

demanded
the
wily
Magua

The

mused
with
himself
for
a
time
;
and
then
,
bending
his
head
*NL*
toward
one
of
his

he
asked

*NL*
Magua
advanced
,

seized
his
captive
strongly
by
the
arm

the

Delawares
fell
back
,
in
silence
;

Cora
,
as
if
conscious
that

remonstrance
would
be
useless

prepared
to
submit
to
her
fate
without

forward

closing
his

dropping
back
into

alike
wearied
with
his
mental
and

his
bodily
exertion

motioning

*NL*
``

back
with
suitable
discretion

he
noted
the
eagerness

Magua
listened
to
his

Magua
shook
his

made
an

sign
for
the
crowd
to
open

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

added
the
scout

with
the
musing
air
of
a
man

had
not

half
made
up
his
mind

Magua
still

continuing
his
efforts

disperse
the

*NL*
*NL*
``

added
the

losing
his
dissembled
coolness
exactly
in

manifested
an
indifference

*NL*
Le
Renard
fiercely
ordered
the
Delawares
,
who
still
lingered
in
an
*NL*
impenetrable
belt
around
him
,
in
hopes
he
would
listen
to
the
amicable
*NL*
proposal

to
open
his

threatening
,
by
the
glance

*NL*
another
appeal
to
the
infallible
justice
of
their
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
What

Hawkeye

turning
with
a
sad
and
humbled
look
to
Uncas

added
the
rugged
*NL*
woodsman
,
bending
his
head
aside
,
and
then
instantly
changing
its
*NL*
direction
again
,
with
a
wistful
look
toward
the
youth
;
``
I
loved
both
you

somewhat
different

never
lost

sight

whether

one

two

there
is
a
path
in

men
may
come
together
again

find
the
rifle
in

it

take

keep
it
for

gifts
do
n't
deny
you
the
use

vengeance

use
it

freely

unburden
griefs

ease
your

Huron

I
*NL*
accept
your
offer

release
the

*NL*
*NL*
A
suppressed
,
but
still
distinct
murmur
of
approbation
ran
through
the
*NL*
crowd
at
this
generous
proposition
;
even
the
fiercest
among
the
*NL*
Delaware
warriors
manifesting
pleasure
at
the
manliness
of
the
intended
*NL*
sacrifice
.
Magua
paused
,
and
for
an
anxious
moment
,
it
might
be
said
,
*NL*
he
doubted
;
then
,
casting
his
eyes
on
Cora
,
with
an
expression
in
which
*NL*
ferocity
and
admiration
were
strangely
mingled
,
his
purpose
became
fixed
*NL*
forever
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
intimated
his
contempt
of
the
offer
with
a
backward
motion
of
his
*NL*
head
,
and
said
,
in
a
steady
and
settled
voice
:
*NL*
*NL*
``

Renard
Subtil
is
a
great
chief

one

he
*NL*
added
,
laying
his
hand
too
familiarly
on
the
shoulder
of
his
captive
to
*NL*
urge
her
onward
;
``
a
Huron
is
no
tattler

go

*NL*
*NL*
The
maiden
drew
back
in
lofty
womanly
reserve
,
and
her
dark
eye
kindled
,
*NL*
while
the
rich
blood
shot
,
like
the
passing
brightness
of
the
sun
,
into
*NL*
her
very
temples

at
the
indignity

*NL*
*NL*
``

death

But
violence
is
unnecessary

she
coldly
said
;
and
*NL*
immediately
turning
to
Hawkeye
,
added
:
``

Abandon

wringing
the
hard

the

Would
to
God
I
could
hear
one
word

his
lips

this
awful

moment

Her
voice
became
choked
,
and
,
for
an
instant
,
she
was
silent
;
*NL*
then
,
advancing
a
step
nigher
to
Duncan
,
who
was
supporting
her
*NL*
unconscious
sister
,
she
continued
,
in
more
subdued
tones
,
but
in
which
*NL*
feeling
and
the
habits
of
her
sex
maintained
a
fearful
struggle
:
``
I
need
*NL*
not
tell
you

cherish
the
treasure

will
possess

You
love
her

*NL*
Heyward
;
that
would
conceal
a
thousand
faults

though
she
had
them

She
*NL*
is
kind
,
gentle
,
sweet
,
good
,
as
mortal
may
be
.
There
is
not
a
blemish
*NL*
in
mind
or
person
at
which
the
proudest
of
you
all
would
sicken
.
She
*NL*
is
fair
--
oh
!
how
surpassingly
fair
!

laying
her
own
beautiful
,
but
less
*NL*
brilliant
,
hand
in
melancholy
affection
on
the
alabaster
forehead
of
*NL*
Alice
,
and
parting
the
golden
hair
which
clustered
about
her
brows
;
``
and
*NL*
yet
her
soul

pure

spotless

I
could
say
much

more

perhaps

than
cooler
reason
would
approve

I
will
spare
you

*NL*
myself

Her
voice
became
inaudible
,
and
her
face
was
bent
over
the
*NL*
form
of
her
sister
.
After
a
long
and
burning
kiss
,
she
arose
,
and
with
*NL*
features
of
the
hue
of
death
,
but
without
even
a
tear
in
her
feverish
*NL*
eye
,
she
turned
away
,
and
added
,
to
the
savage
,
with
all
her
former
*NL*
elevation
of
manner
:
``
Now

if
it
be
your
pleasure

I
will
follow

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay

cried
Duncan
,
placing
Alice
in
the
arms
of
an
Indian
girl
;

``

*NL*
*NL*
It
would
be
difficult
to
describe
the
expression
with
which
Magua
*NL*
listened
to
this
threat
to
follow

There
was
at
first
a
fierce
and
*NL*
manifest
display
of
joy
,
and
then
it
was
instantly
subdued
in
a
look
of
*NL*
cunning
coldness

*NL*
*NL*
``

seizing

by

submissive

``

exclaimed
Magua
,
with
a
taunting
laugh
.
``
Go

''
he
added
,
*NL*
shaking
his
hand
at
the
crowd
,
which
had
slowly
opened
to
admit
his
*NL*
passage
.
``
Where

the
petticoats

Delawares

His
parting
gibes
were
listened
to
in
a
dead
,
boding
silence
,
and
,
with
*NL*
these
biting
words
in
his
mouth
,
the
triumphant
Magua
passed
unmolested

by

passive
captive

*NL*
*NL*
So
long
as
their
enemy
and
his
victim
continued
in
sight
,
the
multitude
*NL*
remained
motionless
as
beings
charmed
to
the
place
by
some
power
that
*NL*
was
friendly
to
the
Huron
;
but
,
the
instant
he
disappeared
,
it
became
*NL*
tossed
and
agitated
by
fierce
and
powerful
passion
.
Uncas
maintained
his
*NL*
elevated
stand
,
keeping
his
eyes
on
the
form
of
Cora
,
until
the
colors
*NL*
of
her
dress
were
blended
with
the
foliage
of
the
forest
;
when
he
*NL*
descended
,
and
,
moving
silently
through
the
throng
,
he
disappeared
in
*NL*
that
lodge
from
which
he
had
so
recently
issued
.
A
few
of
the
graver
and
*NL*
more
attentive
warriors
,
who
caught
the
gleams
of
anger
that
shot
from
*NL*
the
eyes
of
the
young
chief
in
passing
,
followed
him
to
the
place
he
*NL*
had
selected
for
his
meditations
.
After
which
,
Tamenund
and
Alice
were
*NL*
removed
,
and
the
women
and
children
were
ordered
to
disperse
.
During
*NL*
the
momentous
hour
that
succeeded
,
the
encampment
resembled
a
hive
of
*NL*
troubled
bees
,
who
only
awaited
the
appearance
and
example
of
their
*NL*
leader
to
take
some
distant
and
momentous
flight
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
young
warrior
at
length
issued
from
the
lodge
of
Uncas
;
and
,
moving
*NL*
deliberately
,
with
a
sort
of
grave
march
,
toward
a
dwarf
pine
that
grew
*NL*
in
the
crevices
of
the
rocky
terrace
,
he
tore
the
bark
from
its
body
,
*NL*
and
then
turned
whence
he
came
without
speaking
.
He
was
soon
followed
*NL*
by
another
,
who
stripped
the
sapling
of
its
branches
,
leaving
it
a
naked
*NL*
and
blazed
*
trunk
.
A
third
colored
the
post
with
stripes
of
a
dark
red
*NL*
paint
;
all
which
indications
of
a
hostile
design
in
the
leaders
of
the
*NL*
nation
were
received
by
the
men
without
in
a
gloomy
and
ominous
silence
.
*NL*
Finally
,
the
Mohican
himself
reappeared
,
divested
of
all
his
attire
,
*NL*
except
his
girdle
and
leggings
,
and
with
one-half
of
his
fine
features
*NL*
hid
under
a
cloud
of
threatening
black
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
A
tree
which
has
been
partially
or
entirely
stripped
of
*NL*
its
bark
is
said
,
in
the
language
of
the
country
,
to
be
*NL*
``
blazed
.
''
The
term
is
strictly
English
,
for
a
horse
is
said
*NL*
to
be
blazed
when
it
has
a
white
mark
.
*NL*
*NL*
Uncas
moved
with
a
slow
and
dignified
tread
toward
the
post
,
which
he
*NL*
immediately
commenced
encircling
with
a
measured
step
,
not
unlike
an
*NL*
ancient
dance
,
raising
his
voice
,
at
the
same
time
,
in
the
wild
and
*NL*
irregular
chant
of
his
war
song
.
The
notes
were
in
the
extremes
of
*NL*
human
sounds
;
being
sometimes
melancholy
and
exquisitely
plaintive
,
*NL*
even
rivaling
the
melody
of
birds
--
and
then
,
by
sudden
and
startling
*NL*
transitions
,
causing
the
auditors
to
tremble
by
their
depth
and
energy
.
*NL*
The
words
were
few
and
often
repeated
,
proceeding
gradually
from
a
sort
*NL*
of
invocation
,
or
hymn
,
to
the
Deity
,
to
an
intimation
of
the
warrior
's
*NL*
object
,
and
terminating
as
they
commenced
with
an
acknowledgment
of
his
*NL*
own
dependence
on
the
Great
Spirit
.
If
it
were
possible
to
translate
the
*NL*
comprehensive
and
melodious
language
in
which
he
spoke
,
the
ode
might
*NL*
read
something
like
the
following
:
``
Manitou
!
Manitou
!
Manitou
!
Thou
art
*NL*
great
,
thou
art
good
,
thou
art
wise
:
Manitou
!
Manitou
!
Thou
art
just
.
In
*NL*
the
heavens
,
in
the
clouds
,
oh
,
I
see
many
spots
--
many
dark
,
many
red
:
*NL*
In
the
heavens
,
oh
,
I
see
many
clouds
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
woods
,
in
the
air
,
oh
,
I
hear
the
whoop
,
the
long
yell
,
and
the
*NL*
cry
:
In
the
woods
,
oh
,
I
hear
the
loud
whoop
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Manitou
!
Manitou
!
Manitou
!
I
am
weak
--
thou
art
strong
;
I
am
slow
;
*NL*
Manitou
!
Manitou
!
Give
me
aid
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
end
of
what
might
be
called
each
verse
he
made
a
pause
,
by
*NL*
raising
a
note
louder
and
longer
than
common
,
that
was
peculiarly
*NL*
suited
to
the
sentiment
just
expressed
.
The
first
close
was
solemn
,
*NL*
and
intended
to
convey
the
idea
of
veneration
;
the
second
descriptive
,
*NL*
bordering
on
the
alarming
;
and
the
third
was
the
well-known
and
terrific
*NL*
war-whoop
,
which
burst
from
the
lips
of
the
young
warrior
,
like
a
*NL*
combination
of
all
the
frightful
sounds
of
battle
.
The
last
was
like
the
*NL*
first
,
humble
and
imploring
.
Three
times
did
he
repeat
this
song
,
and
as
*NL*
often
did
he
encircle
the
post
in
his
dance
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
close
of
the
first
turn
,
a
grave
and
highly
esteemed
chief
of
the
*NL*
Lenape
followed
his
example
,
singing
words
of
his
own
,
however
,
to
music
*NL*
of
a
similar
character
.
Warrior
after
warrior
enlisted
in
the
dance
,
*NL*
until
all
of
any
renown
and
authority
were
numbered
in
its
mazes
.
The
*NL*
spectacle
now
became
wildly
terrific
;
the
fierce-looking
and
menacing
*NL*
visages
of
the
chiefs
receiving
additional
power
from
the
appalling
*NL*
strains
in
which
they
mingled
their
guttural
tones
.
Just
then
Uncas
*NL*
struck
his
tomahawk
deep
into
the
post
,
and
raised
his
voice
in
a
shout
,
*NL*
which
might
be
termed
his
own
battle
cry
.
The
act
announced
that
he
had
*NL*
assumed
the
chief
authority
in
the
intended
expedition
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
signal
that
awakened
all
the
slumbering
passions
of
the
nation
.
*NL*
A
hundred
youths
,
who
had
hitherto
been
restrained
by
the
diffidence
*NL*
of
their
years
,
rushed
in
a
frantic
body
on
the
fancied
emblem
of
their
*NL*
enemy
,
and
severed
it
asunder
,
splinter
by
splinter
,
until
nothing
*NL*
remained
of
the
trunk
but
its
roots
in
the
earth
.
During
this
moment
of
*NL*
tumult
,
the
most
ruthless
deeds
of
war
were
performed
on
the
fragments
*NL*
of
the
tree
,
with
as
much
apparent
ferocity
as
if
they
were
the
living
*NL*
victims
of
their
cruelty
.
Some
were
scalped
;
some
received
the
keen
and
*NL*
trembling
axe
;
and
others
suffered
by
thrusts
from
the
fatal
knife
.
In
*NL*
short
,
the
manifestations
of
zeal
and
fierce
delight
were
so
great
and
*NL*
unequivocal
,
that
the
expedition
was
declared
to
be
a
war
of
the
nation
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
instant
Uncas
had
struck
the
blow
,
he
moved
out
of
the
circle
,
and
*NL*
cast
his
eyes
up
to
the
sun
,
which
was
just
gaining
the
point
,
when
*NL*
the
truce
with
Magua
was
to
end
.
The
fact
was
soon
announced
by
a
*NL*
significant
gesture
,
accompanied
by
a
corresponding
cry
;
and
the
whole
*NL*
of
the
excited
multitude
abandoned
their
mimic
warfare
,
with
shrill
*NL*
yells
of
pleasure
,
to
prepare
for
the
more
hazardous
experiment
of
the
*NL*
reality
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
whole
face
of
the
encampment
was
instantly
changed
.
The
warriors
,
*NL*
who
were
already
armed
and
painted
,
became
as
still
as
if
they
were
*NL*
incapable
of
any
uncommon
burst
of
emotion
.
On
the
other
hand
,
the
women
*NL*
broke
out
of
the
lodges
,
with
the
songs
of
joy
and
those
of
lamentation
*NL*
so
strangely
mixed
that
it
might
have
been
difficult
to
have
said
which
*NL*
passion
preponderated
.
None
,
however
,
was
idle
.
Some
bore
their
choicest
*NL*
articles
,
others
their
young
,
and
some
their
aged
and
infirm
,
into
*NL*
the
forest
,
which
spread
itself
like
a
verdant
carpet
of
bright
green
*NL*
against
the
side
of
the
mountain
.
Thither
Tamenund
also
retired
,
with
*NL*
calm
composure
,
after
a
short
and
touching
interview
with
Uncas
;
from
*NL*
whom
the
sage
separated
with
the
reluctance
that
a
parent
would
quit
a
*NL*
long
lost
and
just
recovered
child
.
In
the
meantime
,
Duncan
saw
Alice
*NL*
to
a
place
of
safety
,
and
then
sought
the
scout
,
with
a
countenance
that
*NL*
denoted
how
eagerly
he
also
panted
for
the
approaching
contest
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Hawkeye
was
too
much
accustomed
to
the
war
song
and
the
enlistments
*NL*
of
the
natives
,
to
betray
any
interest
in
the
passing
scene
.
He
merely
*NL*
cast
an
occasional
look
at
the
number
and
quality
of
the
warriors
,
who
,
*NL*
from
time
to
time
,
signified
their
readiness
to
accompany
Uncas
to
*NL*
the
field
.
In
this
particular
he
was
soon
satisfied
;
for
,
as
has
been
*NL*
already
seen
,
the
power
of
the
young
chief
quickly
embraced
every
*NL*
fighting
man
in
the
nation
.
After
this
material
point
was
so
*NL*
satisfactorily
decided
,
he
despatched
an
Indian
boy
in
quest
of
*NL*
``
killdeer
''
and
the
rifle
of
Uncas
,
to
the
place
where
they
had
deposited
*NL*
their
weapons
on
approaching
the
camp
of
the
Delawares
;
a
measure
of
*NL*
double
policy
,
inasmuch
as
it
protected
the
arms
from
their
own
fate
,
*NL*
if
detained
as
prisoners
,
and
gave
them
the
advantage
of
appearing
among
*NL*
the
strangers
rather
as
sufferers
than
as
men
provided
with
means
of
*NL*
defense
and
subsistence
.
In
selecting
another
to
perform
the
office
of
*NL*
reclaiming
his
highly
prized
rifle
,
the
scout
had
lost
sight
of
none
of
*NL*
his
habitual
caution
.
He
knew
that
Magua
had
not
come
unattended
,
and
he
*NL*
also
knew
that
Huron
spies
watched
the
movements
of
their
new
enemies
,
*NL*
along
the
whole
boundary
of
the
woods
.
It
would
,
therefore
,
have
been
*NL*
fatal
to
himself
to
have
attempted
the
experiment
;
a
warrior
would
have
*NL*
fared
no
better
;
but
the
danger
of
a
boy
would
not
be
likely
to
commence
*NL*
until
after
his
object
was
discovered
.
When
Heyward
joined
him
,
the
*NL*
scout
was
coolly
awaiting
the
result
of
this
experiment
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
boy
,
who
had
been
well
instructed
,
and
was
sufficiently
crafty
,
*NL*
proceeded
,
with
a
bosom
that
was
swelling
with
the
pride
of
such
a
*NL*
confidence
,
and
all
the
hopes
of
young
ambition
,
carelessly
across
*NL*
the
clearing
to
the
wood
,
which
he
entered
at
a
point
at
some
little
*NL*
distance
from
the
place
where
the
guns
were
secreted
.
The
instant
,
*NL*
however
,
he
was
concealed
by
the
foliage
of
the
bushes
,
his
dusky
form
*NL*
was
to
be
seen
gliding
,
like
that
of
a
serpent
,
toward
the
desired
*NL*
treasure
.
He
was
successful
;
and
in
another
moment
he
appeared
flying
*NL*
across
the
narrow
opening
that
skirted
the
base
of
the
terrace
on
which
*NL*
the
village
stood
,
with
the
velocity
of
an
arrow
,
and
bearing
a
prize
*NL*
in
each
hand
.
He
had
actually
gained
the
crags
,
and
was
leaping
up
their
*NL*
sides
with
incredible
activity
,
when
a
shot
from
the
woods
showed
how
*NL*
accurate
had
been
the
judgment
of
the
scout
.
The
boy
answered
it
with
a
*NL*
feeble
but
contemptuous
shout
;
and
immediately
a
second
bullet
was
*NL*
sent
after
him
from
another
part
of
the
cover
.
At
the
next
instant
he
*NL*
appeared
on
the
level
above
,
elevating
his
guns
in
triumph
,
while
he
*NL*
moved
with
the
air
of
a
conqueror
toward
the
renowned
hunter
who
had
*NL*
honored
him
by
so
glorious
a
commission
.
*NL*
*NL*
Notwithstanding
the
lively
interest
Hawkeye
had
taken
in
the
fate
of
his
*NL*
messenger
,
he
received
``
killdeer
''
with
a
satisfaction
that
,
momentarily
,
*NL*
drove
all
other
recollections
from
his
mind
.
After
examining
the
piece
*NL*
with
an
intelligent
eye
,
and
opening
and
shutting
the
pan
some
ten
or
*NL*
fifteen
times
,
and
trying
sundry
other
equally
important
experiments
on
*NL*
the
lock
,
he
turned
to
the
boy
and
demanded
with
great
manifestations
of
*NL*
kindness
,
if
he
was
hurt
.
The
urchin
looked
proudly
up
in
his
face
,
but
*NL*
made
no
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
I
see
,
lad
,
the
knaves
have
barked
your
arm
!
''
added
the
scout
,
*NL*
taking
up
the
limb
of
the
patient
sufferer
,
across
which
a
deep
flesh
*NL*
wound
had
been
made
by
one
of
the
bullets
;
``
but
a
little
bruised
alder
*NL*
will
act
like
a
charm
.
In
the
meantime
I
will
wrap
it
in
a
badge
of
*NL*
wampum
!
You
have
commenced
the
business
of
a
warrior
early
,
my
brave
*NL*
boy
,
and
are
likely
to
bear
a
plenty
of
honorable
scars
to
your
grave
.
*NL*
I
know
many
young
men
that
have
taken
scalps
who
can
not
show
such
a
mark
*NL*
as
this
.
Go
!
''
having
bound
up
the
arm
;
``
you
will
be
a
chief
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
lad
departed
,
prouder
of
his
flowing
blood
than
the
vainest
courtier
*NL*
could
be
of
his
blushing
ribbon
;
and
stalked
among
the
fellows
of
his
*NL*
age
,
an
object
of
general
admiration
and
envy
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
in
a
moment
of
so
many
serious
and
important
duties
,
this
single
*NL*
act
of
juvenile
fortitude
did
not
attract
the
general
notice
and
*NL*
commendation
it
would
have
received
under
milder
auspices
.
It
had
,
*NL*
however
,
served
to
apprise
the
Delawares
of
the
position
and
the
*NL*
intentions
of
their
enemies
.
Accordingly
a
party
of
adventurers
,
better
*NL*
suited
to
the
task
than
the
weak
though
spirited
boy
,
was
ordered
to
*NL*
dislodge
the
skulkers
.
The
duty
was
soon
performed
;
for
most
of
the
*NL*
Hurons
retired
of
themselves
when
they
found
they
had
been
discovered
.
*NL*
The
Delawares
followed
to
a
sufficient
distance
from
their
own
*NL*
encampment
,
and
then
halted
for
orders
,
apprehensive
of
being
led
into
*NL*
an
ambush
.
As
both
parties
secreted
themselves
,
the
woods
were
again
as
*NL*
still
and
quiet
as
a
mild
summer
morning
and
deep
solitude
could
render
*NL*
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
calm
but
still
impatient
Uncas
now
collected
his
chiefs
,
and
divided
*NL*
his
power
.
He
presented
Hawkeye
as
a
warrior
,
often
tried
,
and
always
*NL*
found
deserving
of
confidence
.
When
he
found
his
friend
met
with
a
*NL*
favorable
reception
,
he
bestowed
on
him
the
command
of
twenty
men
,
*NL*
like
himself
,
active
,
skillful
and
resolute
.
He
gave
the
Delawares
to
*NL*
understand
the
rank
of
Heyward
among
the
troops
of
the
Yengeese
,
and
*NL*
then
tendered
to
him
a
trust
of
equal
authority
.
But
Duncan
declined
the
*NL*
charge
,
professing
his
readiness
to
serve
as
a
volunteer
by
the
side
of
*NL*
the
scout
.
After
this
disposition
,
the
young
Mohican
appointed
various
*NL*
native
chiefs
to
fill
the
different
situations
of
responsibility
,
and
,
*NL*
the
time
pressing
,
he
gave
forth
the
word
to
march
.
He
was
cheerfully
,
*NL*
but
silently
obeyed
by
more
than
two
hundred
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
Their
entrance
into
the
forest
was
perfectly
unmolested
;
nor
did
they
*NL*
encounter
any
living
objects
that
could
either
give
the
alarm
,
or
*NL*
furnish
the
intelligence
they
needed
,
until
they
came
upon
the
lairs
of
*NL*
their
own
scouts
.
Here
a
halt
was
ordered
,
and
the
chiefs
were
assembled
*NL*
to
hold
a
``
whispering
council
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
meeting
divers
plans
of
operation
were
suggested
,
though
none
*NL*
of
a
character
to
meet
the
wishes
of
their
ardent
leader
.
Had
Uncas
*NL*
followed
the
promptings
of
his
own
inclinations
,
he
would
have
led
his
*NL*
followers
to
the
charge
without
a
moment
's
delay
,
and
put
the
conflict
*NL*
to
the
hazard
of
an
instant
issue
;
but
such
a
course
would
have
been
in
*NL*
opposition
to
all
the
received
practises
and
opinions
of
his
countrymen
.
*NL*
He
was
,
therefore
,
fain
to
adopt
a
caution
that
in
the
present
temper
of
*NL*
his
mind
he
execrated
,
and
to
listen
to
advice
at
which
his
fiery
*NL*
spirit
chafed
,
under
the
vivid
recollection
of
Cora
's
danger
and
Magua
's
*NL*
insolence
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
an
unsatisfactory
conference
of
many
minutes
,
a
solitary
*NL*
individual
was
seen
advancing
from
the
side
of
the
enemy
,
with
such
*NL*
apparent
haste
,
as
to
induce
the
belief
he
might
be
a
messenger
charged
*NL*
with
pacific
overtures
.
When
within
a
hundred
yards
,
however
,
of
the
*NL*
cover
behind
which
the
Delaware
council
had
assembled
,
the
stranger
*NL*
hesitated
,
appeared
uncertain
what
course
to
take
,
and
finally
halted
.
*NL*
All
eyes
were
turned
now
on
Uncas
,
as
if
seeking
directions
how
to
*NL*
proceed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hawkeye
,
''
said
the
young
chief
,
in
a
low
voice
,
``
he
must
never
speak
to
*NL*
the
Hurons
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
His
time
has
come
,
''
said
the
laconic
scout
,
thrusting
the
long
barrel
*NL*
of
his
rifle
through
the
leaves
,
and
taking
his
deliberate
and
fatal
*NL*
aim
.
But
,
instead
of
pulling
the
trigger
,
he
lowered
the
muzzle
again
,
*NL*
and
indulged
himself
in
a
fit
of
his
peculiar
mirth
.
``
I
took
the
imp
for
*NL*
a
Mingo
,
as
I
'm
a
miserable
sinner
!
''
he
said
;
``
but
when
my
eye
ranged
*NL*
along
his
ribs
for
a
place
to
get
the
bullet
in
--
would
you
think
it
,
*NL*
Uncas
--
I
saw
the
musicianer
's
blower
;
and
so
,
after
all
,
it
is
the
man
*NL*
they
call
Gamut
,
whose
death
can
profit
no
one
,
and
whose
life
,
if
this
*NL*
tongue
can
do
anything
but
sing
,
may
be
made
serviceable
to
our
own
*NL*
ends
.
If
sounds
have
not
lost
their
virtue
,
I
'll
soon
have
a
discourse
*NL*
with
the
honest
fellow
,
and
that
in
a
voice
he
'll
find
more
agreeable
*NL*
than
the
speech
of
`
killdeer
'
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
saying
,
Hawkeye
laid
aside
his
rifle
;
and
,
crawling
through
the
*NL*
bushes
until
within
hearing
of
David
,
he
attempted
to
repeat
the
musical
*NL*
effort
,
which
had
conducted
himself
,
with
so
much
safety
and
eclat
,
*NL*
through
the
Huron
encampment
.
The
exquisite
organs
of
Gamut
could
not
*NL*
readily
be
deceived
-LRB-
and
,
to
say
the
truth
,
it
would
have
been
*NL*
difficult
for
any
other
than
Hawkeye
to
produce
a
similar
noise
-RRB-
,
and
,
*NL*
consequently
,
having
once
before
heard
the
sounds
,
he
now
knew
whence
*NL*
they
proceeded
.
The
poor
fellow
appeared
relieved
from
a
state
of
great
*NL*
embarrassment
;
for
,
pursuing
the
direction
of
the
voice
--
a
task
that
to
*NL*
him
was
not
much
less
arduous
that
it
would
have
been
to
have
gone
up
in
*NL*
the
face
of
a
battery
--
he
soon
discovered
the
hidden
songster
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wonder
what
the
Hurons
will
think
of
that
!
''
said
the
scout
,
laughing
,
*NL*
as
he
took
his
companion
by
the
arm
,
and
urged
him
toward
the
rear
.
*NL*
``
If
the
knaves
lie
within
earshot
,
they
will
say
there
are
two
*NL*
non-compossers
instead
of
one
!
But
here
we
are
safe
,
''
he
added
,
pointing
*NL*
to
Uncas
and
his
associates
.
``
Now
give
us
the
history
of
the
Mingo
*NL*
inventions
in
natural
English
,
and
without
any
ups
and
downs
of
voice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
David
gazed
about
him
,
at
the
fierce
and
wild-looking
chiefs
,
in
mute
*NL*
wonder
;
but
assured
by
the
presence
of
faces
that
he
knew
,
he
soon
*NL*
rallied
his
faculties
so
far
as
to
make
an
intelligent
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
heathen
are
abroad
in
goodly
numbers
,
''
said
David
;
``
and
,
I
fear
,
*NL*
with
evil
intent
.
There
has
been
much
howling
and
ungodly
revelry
,
*NL*
together
with
such
sounds
as
it
is
profanity
to
utter
,
in
their
*NL*
habitations
within
the
past
hour
,
so
much
so
,
in
truth
,
that
I
have
fled
*NL*
to
the
Delawares
in
search
of
peace
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
ears
might
not
have
profited
much
by
the
exchange
,
had
you
been
*NL*
quicker
of
foot
,
''
returned
the
scout
a
little
dryly
.
``
But
let
that
be
as
*NL*
it
may
;
where
are
the
Hurons
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
lie
hid
in
the
forest
,
between
this
spot
and
their
village
in
such
*NL*
force
,
that
prudence
would
teach
you
instantly
to
return
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Uncas
cast
a
glance
along
the
range
of
trees
which
concealed
his
own
*NL*
band
and
mentioned
the
name
of
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Magua
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
among
them
.
He
brought
in
the
maiden
that
had
sojourned
with
the
*NL*
Delawares
;
and
,
leaving
her
in
the
cave
,
has
put
himself
,
like
a
raging
*NL*
wolf
,
at
the
head
of
his
savages
.
I
know
not
what
has
troubled
his
*NL*
spirit
so
greatly
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
left
her
,
you
say
,
in
the
cave
!
''
interrupted
Heyward
;
''
't
is
well
*NL*
that
we
know
its
situation
!
May
not
something
be
done
for
her
instant
*NL*
relief
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Uncas
looked
earnestly
at
the
scout
,
before
he
asked
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
says
Hawkeye
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
me
twenty
rifles
,
and
I
will
turn
to
the
right
,
along
the
stream
;
*NL*
and
,
passing
by
the
huts
of
the
beaver
,
will
join
the
Sagamore
and
the
*NL*
colonel
.
You
shall
then
hear
the
whoop
from
that
quarter
;
with
this
wind
*NL*
one
may
easily
send
it
a
mile
.
Then
,
Uncas
,
do
you
drive
in
the
front
;
*NL*
when
they
come
within
range
of
our
pieces
,
we
will
give
them
a
blow
*NL*
that
,
I
pledge
the
good
name
of
an
old
frontiersman
,
shall
make
their
*NL*
line
bend
like
an
ashen
bow

After
which
,
we
will
carry
the
village
,
and
*NL*
take
the
woman
from
the
cave

when
the
affair
may
be
finished
with

by

blow

a
victory

,
in
the
Indian
fashion

with
dodge

cover

There
may
be
no
great

learning

in
this
plan

with
courage

patience
it

all
*NL*
be
done

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
like
it
very
much

cried
Duncan
,
who
saw
that
the
release
of
Cora
*NL*
was
the
primary
object
in
the
mind
of
the
scout
;
``
I
like
it
much
.
Let
it
*NL*
be
instantly
attempted
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
short
conference
,
the
plan
was
matured
,
and
rendered
more
*NL*
intelligible
to
the
several
parties
;
the
different
signals
were
*NL*
appointed
,
and
the
chiefs
separated
,
each
to
his
allotted

*NL*
*NL*
During
the
time
Uncas
was
making
this
disposition
of
his
forces
,
the
*NL*
woods
were
as
still
,
and
,
with
the
exception
of
those
who
had
met
in
*NL*
council
,
apparently
as
much
untenanted
as
when
they
came
fresh
from
*NL*
the
hands
of
their
Almighty
Creator
.
The
eye
could
range
,
in
every
*NL*
direction
,
through
the
long
and
shadowed
vistas
of
the
trees
;
but
*NL*
nowhere
was
any
object
to
be
seen
that
did
not
properly
belong
to
the
*NL*
peaceful
and
slumbering
scenery
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
and
there
a
bird
was
heard
fluttering
among
the
branches
of
the
*NL*
beeches
,
and
occasionally
a
squirrel
dropped
a
nut
,
drawing
the
startled
*NL*
looks
of
the
party
for
a
moment
to
the
place
;
but
the
instant
the
casual
*NL*
interruption
ceased
,
the
passing
air
was
heard
murmuring
above
their
*NL*
heads
,
along
that
verdant
and
undulating
surface
of
forest
,
which
spread
*NL*
itself
unbroken
,
unless
by
stream
or
lake
,
over
such
a
vast
region
of
*NL*
country
.
Across
the
tract
of
wilderness
which
lay
between
the
Delawares
*NL*
and
the
village
of
their
enemies
,
it
seemed
as
if
the
foot
of
man
had
*NL*
never
trodden
,
so
breathing
and
deep
was
the
silence
in
which
it
lay
.
*NL*
But
Hawkeye
,
whose
duty
led
him
foremost
in
the
adventure
,
knew
the
*NL*
character
of
those
with
whom
he
was
about
to
contend
too
well
to
trust
*NL*
the
treacherous
quiet
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
saw
his
little
band
collected
,
the
scout
threw
``
killdeer
''
into
*NL*
the
hollow
of
his
arm
,
and
making
a
silent
signal
that
he
would
be
*NL*
followed
,
he
led
them
many
rods
toward
the
rear
,
into
the
bed
of
a
*NL*
little
brook
which
they
had
crossed
in
advancing
.
Here
he
halted
,
and
*NL*
after
waiting
for
the
whole
of
his
grave
and
attentive
warriors
to
close
*NL*
about
him
,
he
spoke
in
Delaware
,
demanding
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
any
of
my
young
men
know
whither
this
run
will
lead
us
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
Delaware
stretched
forth
a
hand
,
with
the
two
fingers
separated
,
*NL*
and
indicating
the
manner
in
which
they
were
joined
at
the
root
,
he
*NL*
answered
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Before
the
sun
could
go
his
own
length
,
the
little
water
will
be
in
*NL*
the
big
.
''
Then
he
added
,
pointing
in
the
direction
of
the
place
he
*NL*
mentioned
,
``
the
two
make
enough
for
the
beavers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
as
much
,
''
returned
the
scout
,
glancing
his
eye
upward
at
the
*NL*
opening
in
the
tree-tops
,
``
from
the
course
it
takes
,
and
the
bearings
of
*NL*
the
mountains
.
Men
,
we
will
keep
within
the
cover
of
its
banks
till
we
*NL*
scent
the
Hurons
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
companions
gave
the
usual
brief
exclamation
of
assent
,
but
,
*NL*
perceiving
that
their
leader
was
about
to
lead
the
way
in
person
,
one
*NL*
or
two
made
signs
that
all
was
not
as
it
should
be
.
Hawkeye
,
who
*NL*
comprehended
their
meaning
glances
,
turned
and
perceived
that
his
party
*NL*
had
been
followed
thus
far
by
the
singing-master
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
,
friend
,
''
asked
the
scout
,
gravely
,
and
perhaps
with
a
*NL*
little
of
the
pride
of
conscious
deserving
in
his
manner
,
``
that
this
is
*NL*
a
band
of
rangers
chosen
for
the
most
desperate
service
,
and
put
under
*NL*
the
command
of
one
who
,
though
another
might
say
it
with
a
better
face
,
*NL*
will
not
be
apt
to
leave
them
idle
.
It
may
not
be
five
,
it
can
not
be
*NL*
thirty
minutes
,
before
we
tread
on
the
body
of
a
Huron
,
living
or
dead
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Though
not
admonished
of
your
intentions
in
words
,
''
returned
David
,
*NL*
whose
face
was
a
little
flushed
,
and
whose
ordinarily
quiet
and
*NL*
unmeaning
eyes
glimmered
with
an
expression
of
unusual
fire
,
``
your
men
*NL*
have
reminded
me
of
the
children
of
Jacob
going
out
to
battle
against
*NL*
the
Shechemites
,
for
wickedly
aspiring
to
wedlock
with
a
woman
of
a
race
*NL*
that
was
favored
of
the
Lord
.
Now
,
I
have
journeyed
far
,
and
sojourned
*NL*
much
in
good
and
evil
with
the
maiden
ye
seek
;
and
,
though
not
a
man
*NL*
of
war
,
with
my
loins
girded
and
my
sword
sharpened
,
yet
would
I
gladly
*NL*
strike
a
blow
in
her
behalf
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
scout
hesitated
,
as
if
weighing
the
chances
of
such
a
strange
*NL*
enlistment
in
his
mind
before
he
answered
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
not
the
use
of
any
we
`
pon
.
You
carry
no
rifle
;
and
believe
me
,
*NL*
what
the
Mingoes
take
they
will
freely
give
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Though
not
a
vaunting
and
bloodily
disposed
Goliath
,
''
returned
David
,
*NL*
drawing
a
sling
from
beneath
his
parti-colored
and
uncouth
attire
,
``
I
*NL*
have
not
forgotten
the
example
of
the
Jewish
boy
.
With
this
ancient
*NL*
instrument
of
war
have
I
practised
much
in
my
youth
,
and
peradventure
*NL*
the
skill
has
not
entirely
departed
from
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
!
''
said
Hawkeye
,
considering
the
deer-skin
thong
and
apron
,
with
a
*NL*
cold
and
discouraging
eye
;
``
the
thing
might
do
its
work
among
arrows
,
or
*NL*
even
knives
;
but
these
Mengwe
have
been
furnished
by
the
Frenchers
with
*NL*
a
good
grooved
barrel
a
man
.
However
,
it
seems
to
be
your
gift
to
go
*NL*
unharmed
amid
fire
;
and
as
you
have
hitherto
been
favored
--
major
,
you
*NL*
have
left
your
rifle
at
a
cock
;
a
single
shot
before
the
time
would
be
*NL*
just
twenty
scalps
lost
to
no
purpose
--
singer
,
you
can
follow
;
we
may
*NL*
find
use
for
you
in
the
shoutings
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thank
you
,
friend
,
''
returned
David
,
supplying
himself
,
like
his
royal
*NL*
namesake
,
from
among
the
pebbles
of
the
brook
;
``
though
not
given
to
*NL*
the
desire
to
kill
,
had
you
sent
me
away
my
spirit
would
have
been
*NL*
troubled
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Remember
,
''
added
the
scout
,
tapping
his
own
head
significantly
on
that
*NL*
spot
where
Gamut
was
yet
sore
,
``
we
come
to
fight
,
and
not
to
musickate
.
*NL*
Until
the
general
whoop
is
given
,
nothing
speaks
but
the
rifle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
David
nodded
,
as
much
to
signify
his
acquiescence
with
the
terms
;
and
*NL*
then
Hawkeye
,
casting
another
observant
glance
over
his
followers
made
*NL*
the
signal
to
proceed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Their
route
lay
,
for
the
distance
of
a
mile
,
along
the
bed
of
the
*NL*
water-course
.
Though
protected
from
any
great
danger
of
observation
by
*NL*
the
precipitous
banks
,
and
the
thick
shrubbery
which
skirted
the
stream
,
*NL*
no
precaution
known
to
an
Indian
attack
was
neglected
.
A
warrior
rather
*NL*
crawled
than
walked
on
each
flank
so
as
to
catch
occasional
glimpses
*NL*
into
the
forest
;
and
every
few
minutes
the
band
came
to
a
halt
,
and
*NL*
listened
for
hostile
sounds
,
with
an
acuteness
of
organs
that
would
be
*NL*
scarcely
conceivable
to
a
man
in
a
less
natural
state
.
Their
march
was
,
*NL*
however
,
unmolested
,
and
they
reached
the
point
where
the
lesser
stream
*NL*
was
lost
in
the
greater
,
without
the
smallest
evidence
that
their
*NL*
progress
had
been
noted
.
Here
the
scout
again
halted
,
to
consult
the
*NL*
signs
of
the
forest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
likely
to
have
a
good
day
for
a
fight
,
''
he
said
,
in
English
,
*NL*
addressing
Heyward
,
and
glancing
his
eyes
upward
at
the
clouds
,
which
*NL*
began
to
move
in
broad
sheets
across
the
firmament
;
``
a
bright
sun
and
a
*NL*
glittering
barrel
are
no
friends
to
true
sight
.
Everything
is
favorable
;
*NL*
they
have
the
wind
,
which
will
bring
down
their
noises
and
their
smoke
,
*NL*
too
,
no
little
matter
in
itself
;
whereas
,
with
us
it
will
be
first
*NL*
a
shot
,
and
then
a
clear
view
.
But
here
is
an
end
to
our
cover
;
the
*NL*
beavers
have
had
the
range
of
this
stream
for
hundreds
of
years
,
and
*NL*
what
atween
their
food
and
their
dams
,
there
is
,
as
you
see
,
many
a
*NL*
girdled
stub
,
but
few
living
trees
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hawkeye
had
,
in
truth
,
in
these
few
words
,
given
no
bad
description
of
*NL*
the
prospect
that
now
lay
in
their
front
.
The
brook
was
irregular
in
its
*NL*
width
,
sometimes
shooting
through
narrow
fissures
in
the
rocks
,
and
at
*NL*
others
spreading
over
acres
of
bottom
land
,
forming
little
areas
that
*NL*
might
be
termed
ponds
.
Everywhere
along
its
bands
were
the
moldering
*NL*
relics
of
dead
trees
,
in
all
the
stages
of
decay
,
from
those
that
*NL*
groaned
on
their
tottering
trunks
to
such
as
had
recently
been
robbed
of
*NL*
those
rugged
coats
that
so
mysteriously
contain
their
principle
of
life
.
*NL*
A
few
long
,
low
,
and
moss-covered
piles
were
scattered
among
them
,
like
*NL*
the
memorials
of
a
former
and
long-departed
generation
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
these
minute
particulars
were
noted
by
the
scout
,
with
a
gravity
and
*NL*
interest
that
they
probably
had
never
before
attracted
.
He
knew
that
*NL*
the
Huron
encampment
lay
a
short
half
mile
up
the
brook
;
and
,
with
*NL*
the
characteristic
anxiety
of
one
who
dreaded
a
hidden
danger
,
he
was
*NL*
greatly
troubled
at
not
finding
the
smallest
trace
of
the
presence
of
*NL*
his
enemy
.
Once
or
twice
he
felt
induced
to
give
the
order
for
a
rush
,
*NL*
and
to
attempt
the
village
by
surprise
;
but
his
experience
quickly
*NL*
admonished
him
of
the
danger
of
so
useless
an
experiment
.
Then
he
*NL*
listened
intently
,
and
with
painful
uncertainty
,
for
the
sounds
of
*NL*
hostility
in
the
quarter
where
Uncas
was
left
;
but
nothing
was
audible
*NL*
except
the
sighing
of
the
wind
,
that
began
to
sweep
over
the
bosom
of
*NL*
the
forest
in
gusts
which
threatened
a
tempest
.
At
length
,
yielding
*NL*
rather
to
his
unusual
impatience
than
taking
counsel
from
his
knowledge
,
*NL*
he
determined
to
bring
matters
to
an
issue
,
by
unmasking
his
force
,
and
*NL*
proceeding
cautiously
,
but
steadily
,
up
the
stream
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
scout
had
stood
,
while
making
his
observations
,
sheltered
by
a
*NL*
brake
,
and
his
companions
still
lay
in
the
bed
of
the
ravine
,
through
*NL*
which
the
smaller
stream
debouched
;
but
on
hearing
his
low
,
though
*NL*
intelligible
,
signal
the
whole
party
stole
up
the
bank
,
like
so
many
*NL*
dark
specters
,
and
silently
arranged
themselves
around
him
.
Pointing
in
*NL*
the
direction
he
wished
to
proceed
,
Hawkeye
advanced
,
the
band
breaking
*NL*
off
in
single
files
,
and
following
so
accurately
in
his
footsteps
,
as
to
*NL*
leave
it
,
if
we
except
Heyward
and
David
,
the
trail
of
but
a
single
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
party
was
,
however
,
scarcely
uncovered
before
a
volley
from
a
dozen
*NL*
rifles
was
heard
in
their
rear
;
and
a
Delaware
leaping
high
in
to
the
*NL*
air
,
like
a
wounded
deer
,
fell
at
his
whole
length
,
dead
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
I
feared
some
deviltry
like
this
!
''
exclaimed
the
scout
,
in
English
,
*NL*
adding
,
with
the
quickness
of
thought
,
in
his
adopted
tongue
:
``
To
cover
,
*NL*
men
,
and
charge
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
band
dispersed
at
the
word
,
and
before
Heyward
had
well
recovered
*NL*
from
his
surprise
,
he
found
himself
standing
alone
with
David
.
Luckily
*NL*
the
Hurons
had
already
fallen
back
,
and
he
was
safe
from
their
fire
.
But
*NL*
this
state
of
things
was
evidently
to
be
of
short
continuance
;
for
the
*NL*
scout
set
the
example
of
pressing
on
their
retreat
,
by
discharging
his
*NL*
rifle
,
and
darting
from
tree
to
tree
as
his
enemy
slowly
yielded
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
would
seem
that
the
assault
had
been
made
by
a
very
small
party
of
*NL*
the
Hurons
,
which
,
however
,
continued
to
increase
in
numbers
,
as
it
*NL*
retired
on
its
friends
,
until
the
return
fire
was
very
nearly
,
if
not
*NL*
quite
,
equal
to
that
maintained
by
the
advancing
Delawares
.
Heyward
*NL*
threw
himself
among
the
combatants
,
and
imitating
the
necessary
caution
*NL*
of
his
companions
,
he
made
quick
discharges
with
his
own
rifle
.
The
*NL*
contest
now
grew
warm
and
stationary
.
Few
were
injured
,
as
both
parties
*NL*
kept
their
bodies
as
much
protected
as
possible
by
the
trees
;
never
,
*NL*
indeed
,
exposing
any
part
of
their
persons
except
in
the
act
of
taking
*NL*
aim
.
But
the
chances
were
gradually
growing
unfavorable
to
Hawkeye
and
*NL*
his
band
.
The
quick-sighted
scout
perceived
his
danger
without
knowing
*NL*
how
to
remedy
it
.
He
saw
it
was
more
dangerous
to
retreat
than
to
*NL*
maintain
his
ground
:
while
he
found
his
enemy
throwing
out
men
on
his
*NL*
flank
;
which
rendered
the
task
of
keeping
themselves
covered
so
very
*NL*
difficult
to
the
Delawares
,
as
nearly
to
silence
their
fire
.
At
this
*NL*
embarrassing
moment
,
when
they
began
to
think
the
whole
of
the
hostile
*NL*
tribe
was
gradually
encircling
them
,
they
heard
the
yell
of
combatants
*NL*
and
the
rattling
of
arms
echoing
under
the
arches
of
the
wood
at
the
*NL*
place
where
Uncas
was
posted
,
a
bottom
which
,
in
a
manner
,
lay
beneath
*NL*
the
ground
on
which
Hawkeye
and
his
party
were
contending
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
effects
of
this
attack
were
instantaneous
,
and
to
the
scout
and
his
*NL*
friends
greatly
relieving
.
It
would
seem
that
,
while
his
own
surprise
*NL*
had
been
anticipated
,
and
had
consequently
failed
,
the
enemy
,
in
their
*NL*
turn
,
having
been
deceived
in
its
object
and
in
his
numbers
,
had
left
*NL*
too
small
a
force
to
resist
the
impetuous
onset
of
the
young
Mohican
.
*NL*
This
fact
was
doubly
apparent
,
by
the
rapid
manner
in
which
the
battle
*NL*
in
the
forest
rolled
upward
toward
the
village
,
and
by
an
instant
*NL*
falling
off
in
the
number
of
their
assailants
,
who
rushed
to
assist
in
*NL*
maintaining
the
front
,
and
,
as
it
now
proved
to
be
,
the
principal
point
*NL*
of
defense
.
*NL*
*NL*
Animating
his
followers
by
his
voice
,
and
his
own
example
,
Hawkeye
then
*NL*
gave
the
word
to
bear
down
upon
their
foes
.
The
charge
,
in
that
rude
*NL*
species
of
warfare
,
consisted
merely
in
pushing
from
cover
to
cover
,
*NL*
nigher
to
the
enemy
;
and
in
this
maneuver
he
was
instantly
and
*NL*
successfully
obeyed
.
The
Hurons
were
compelled
to
withdraw
,
and
the
*NL*
scene
of
the
contest
rapidly
changed
from
the
more
open
ground
,
on
which
*NL*
it
had
commenced
,
to
a
spot
where
the
assailed
found
a
thicket
to
*NL*
rest
upon
.
Here
the
struggle
was
protracted
,
arduous
and
seemingly
of
*NL*
doubtful
issue
;
the
Delawares
,
though
none
of
them
fell
,
beginning
to
*NL*
bleed
freely
,
in
consequence
of
the
disadvantage
at
which
they
were
*NL*
held
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
crisis
,
Hawkeye
found
means
to
get
behind
the
same
tree
as
that
*NL*
which
served
for
a
cover
to
Heyward
;
most
of
his
own
combatants
being
*NL*
within
call
,
a
little
on
his
right
,
where
they
maintained
rapid
,
though
*NL*
fruitless
,
discharges
on
their
sheltered
enemies
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
a
young
man
,
major
,
''
said
the
scout
,
dropping
the
butt
of
*NL*
``
killdeer
''
to
the
earth
,
and
leaning
on
the
barrel
,
a
little
fatigued
*NL*
with
his
previous
industry
;
``
and
it
may
be
your
gift
to
lead
armies
,
*NL*
at
some
future
day
,
ag
`
in
these
imps
,
the
Mingoes
.
You
may
here
see
the
*NL*
philosophy
of
an
Indian
fight
.
It
consists
mainly
in
ready
hand
,
a
quick
*NL*
eye
and
a
good
cover
.
Now
,
if
you
had
a
company
of
the
Royal
Americans
*NL*
here
,
in
what
manner
would
you
set
them
to
work
in
this
business
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
bayonet
would
make
a
road
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
there
is
white
reason
in
what
you
say
;
but
a
man
must
ask
himself
,
*NL*
in
this
wilderness
,
how
many
lives
he
can
spare
.
No
--
horse
*
,
''
continued
*NL*
the
scout
,
shaking
his
head
,
like
one
who
mused
;
``
horse
,
I
am
ashamed
to
*NL*
say
must
sooner
or
later
decide
these
scrimmages
.
The
brutes
are
better
*NL*
than
men
,
and
to
horse
must
we
come
at
last
.
Put
a
shodden
hoof
on
the
*NL*
moccasin
of
a
red-skin
,
and
,
if
his
rifle
be
once
emptied
,
he
will
never
*NL*
stop
to
load
it
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*
The
American
forest
admits
of
the
passage
of
horses
,
there
*NL*
being
little
underbrush
,
and
few
tangled
brakes
.
The
plan
of
*NL*
Hawkeye
is
the
one
which
has
always
proved
the
most
*NL*
successful
in
the
battles
between
the
whites
and
the
*NL*
Indians
.
Wayne
,
in
his
celebrated
campaign
on
the
Miami
,
*NL*
received
the
fire
of
his
enemies
in
line
;
and
then
causing
*NL*
his
dragoons
to
wheel
round
his
flanks
,
the
Indians
were
*NL*
driven
from
their
covers
before
they
had
time
to
load
.
One
*NL*
of
the
most
conspicuous
of
the
chiefs
who
fought
in
the
*NL*
battle
of
Miami
assured
the
writer
,
that
the
red
men
could
*NL*
not
fight
the
warriors
with
``
long
knives
and
leather
*NL*
stockings
''
;
meaning
the
dragoons
with
their
sabers
and
*NL*
boots
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
a
subject
that
might
better
be
discussed
at
another
time
,
''
*NL*
returned
Heyward
;
``
shall
we
charge
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
no
contradiction
to
the
gifts
of
any
man
in
passing
his
breathing
*NL*
spells
in
useful
reflections
,
''
the
scout
replied
.
``
As
to
rush
,
I
little
*NL*
relish
such
a
measure
;
for
a
scalp
or
two
must
be
thrown
away
in
the
*NL*
attempt
.
And
yet
,
''
he
added
,
bending
his
head
aside
,
to
catch
the
sounds
*NL*
of
the
distant
combat
,
``
if
we
are
to
be
of
use
to
Uncas
,
these
knaves
in
*NL*
our
front
must
be
got
rid
of
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
turning
with
a
prompt
and
decided
air
,
he
called
aloud
to
his
*NL*
Indians
,
in
their
own
language
.
His
words
were
answered
by
a
shout
;
*NL*
and
,
at
a
given
signal
,
each
warrior
made
a
swift
movement
around
his
*NL*
particular
tree
.
The
sight
of
so
many
dark
bodies
,
glancing
before
their
*NL*
eyes
at
the
same
instant
,
drew
a
hasty
and
consequently
an
ineffectual
*NL*
fire
from
the
Hurons
.
Without
stopping
to
breathe
,
the
Delawares
leaped
*NL*
in
long
bounds
toward
the
wood
,
like
so
many
panthers
springing
upon
*NL*
their
prey
.
Hawkeye
was
in
front
,
brandishing
his
terrible
rifle
and
*NL*
animating
his
followers
by
his
example
.
A
few
of
the
older
and
more
*NL*
cunning
Hurons
,
who
had
not
been
deceived
by
the
artifice
which
had
been
*NL*
practiced
to
draw
their
fire
,
now
made
a
close
and
deadly
discharge
of
*NL*
their
pieces
and
justified
the
apprehensions
of
the
scout
by
felling
*NL*
three
of
his
foremost
warriors
.
But
the
shock
was
insufficient
to
repel
*NL*
the
impetus
of
the
charge
.
The
Delawares
broke
into
the
cover
with
the
*NL*
ferocity
of
their
natures
and
swept
away
every
trace
of
resistance
by
*NL*
the
fury
of
the
onset
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
combat
endured
only
for
an
instant
,
hand
to
hand
,
and
then
the
*NL*
assailed
yielded
ground
rapidly
,
until
they
reached
the
opposite
*NL*
margin
of
the
thicket
,
where
they
clung
to
the
cover
,
with
the
sort
of
*NL*
obstinacy
that
is
so
often
witnessed
in
hunted
brutes
.
At
this
critical
*NL*
moment
,
when
the
success
of
the
struggle
was
again
becoming
doubtful
,
*NL*
the
crack
of
a
rifle
was
heard
behind
the
Hurons
,
and
a
bullet
came
*NL*
whizzing
from
among
some
beaver
lodges
,
which
were
situated
in
the
*NL*
clearing
,
in
their
rear
,
and
was
followed
by
the
fierce
and
appalling
*NL*
yell
of
the
war-whoop
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
speaks
the
Sagamore
!
''
shouted
Hawkeye
,
answering
the
cry
with
his
*NL*
own
stentorian
voice
;
``
we
have
them
now
in
face
and
back
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
effect
on
the
Hurons
was
instantaneous
.
Discouraged
by
an
assault
*NL*
from
a
quarter
that
left
them
no
opportunity
for
cover
,
the
warriors
*NL*
uttered
a
common
yell
of
disappointment
,
and
breaking
off
in
a
*NL*
body
,
they
spread
themselves
across
the
opening
,
heedless
of
every
*NL*
consideration
but
flight
.
Many
fell
,
in
making
the
experiment
,
under
the
*NL*
bullets
and
the
blows
of
the
pursuing
Delawares
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
shall
not
pause
to
detail
the
meeting
between
the
scout
and
*NL*
Chingachgook
,
or
the
more
touching
interview
that
Duncan
held
with
*NL*
Munro
.
A
few
brief
and
hurried
words
served
to
explain
the
state
of
*NL*
things
to
both
parties
;
and
then
Hawkeye
,
pointing
out
the
Sagamore
to
*NL*
his
band
,
resigned
the
chief
authority
into
the
hands
of
the
Mohican
*NL*
chief
.
Chingachgook
assumed
the
station
to
which
his
birth
and
*NL*
experience
gave
him
so
distinguished
a
claim
,
with
the
grave
dignity
*NL*
that
always
gives
force
to
the
mandates
of
a
native
warrior
.
Following
*NL*
the
footsteps
of
the
scout
,
he
led
the
party
back
through
the
thicket
,
*NL*
his
men
scalping
the
fallen
Hurons
and
secreting
the
bodies
of
their
own
*NL*
dead
as
they
proceeded
,
until
they
gained
a
point
where
the
former
was
*NL*
content
to
make
a
halt
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
warriors
,
who
had
breathed
themselves
freely
in
the
preceding
*NL*
struggle
,
were
now
posted
on
a
bit
of
level
ground
,
sprinkled
with
*NL*
trees
in
sufficient
numbers
to
conceal
them
.
The
land
fell
away
rather
*NL*
precipitately
in
front
,
and
beneath
their
eyes
stretched
,
for
several
*NL*
miles
,
a
narrow
,
dark
,
and
wooded
vale
.
It
was
through
this
dense
and
*NL*
dark
forest
that
Uncas
was
still
contending
with
the
main
body
of
the
*NL*
Hurons
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Mohican
and
his
friends
advanced
to
the
brow
of
the
hill
,
and
*NL*
listened
,
with
practised
ears
,
to
the
sounds
of
the
combat
.
A
few
*NL*
birds
hovered
over
the
leafy
bosom
of
the
valley
,
frightened
from
their
*NL*
secluded
nests
;
and
here
and
there
a
light
vapory
cloud
,
which
seemed
*NL*
already
blending
with
the
atmosphere
,
arose
above
the
trees
,
and
*NL*
indicated
some
spot
where
the
struggle
had
been
fierce
and
stationary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
fight
is
coming
up
the
ascent
,
''
said
Duncan
,
pointing
in
the
*NL*
direction
of
a
new
explosion
of
firearms
;
``
we
are
too
much
in
the
center
*NL*
of
their
line
to
be
effective
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
will
incline
into
the
hollow
,
where
the
cover
is
thicker
,
''
said
*NL*
the
scout
,
``
and
that
will
leave
us
well
on
their
flank
.
Go
,
Sagamore
;
*NL*
you
will
hardly
be
in
time
to
give
the
whoop
,
and
lead
on
the
young
men
.
*NL*
I
will
fight
this
scrimmage
with
warriors
of
my
own
color
.
You
know
me
,
*NL*
Mohican
;
not
a
Huron
of
them
all
shall
cross
the
swell
,
into
your
rear
,
*NL*
without
the
notice
of
`
killdeer
'
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Indian
chief
paused
another
moment
to
consider
the
signs
of
the
*NL*
contest
,
which
was
now
rolling
rapidly
up
the
ascent
,
a
certain
evidence
*NL*
that
the
Delawares
triumphed
;
nor
did
he
actually
quit
the
place
until
*NL*
admonished
of
the
proximity
of
his
friends
,
as
well
as
enemies
,
by
the
*NL*
bullets
of
the
former
,
which
began
to
patter
among
the
dried
leaves
on
*NL*
the
ground
,
like
the
bits
of
falling
hail
which
precede
the
bursting
of
*NL*
the
tempest
.
Hawkeye
and
his
three
companions
withdrew
a
few
paces
to
*NL*
a
shelter
,
and
awaited
the
issue
with
calmness
that
nothing
but
great
*NL*
practise
could
impart
in
such
a
scene
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
long
before
the
reports
of
the
rifles
began
to
lose
the
*NL*
echoes
of
the
woods
,
and
to
sound
like
weapons
discharged
in
the
open
*NL*
air
.
Then
a
warrior
appeared
,
here
and
there
,
driven
to
the
skirts
of
*NL*
the
forest
,
and
rallying
as
he
entered
the
clearing
,
as
at
the
place
*NL*
where
the
final
stand
was
to
be
made
.
These
were
soon
joined
by
others
,
*NL*
until
a
long
line
of
swarthy
figures
was
to
be
seen
clinging
to
*NL*
the
cover
with
the
obstinacy
of
desperation
.
Heyward
began
to
*NL*
grow
impatient
,
and
turned
his
eyes
anxiously
in
the
direction
of
*NL*
Chingachgook
.
The
chief
was
seated
on
a
rock
,
with
nothing
visible
but
*NL*
his
calm
visage
,
considering
the
spectacle
with
an
eye
as
deliberate
as
*NL*
if
he
were
posted
there
merely
to
view
the
struggle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
time
has
come
for
the
Delaware
to
strike
!
''
said
Duncan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
so
,
not
so
,
''
returned
the
scout
;
``
when
he
scents
his
friends
,
he
*NL*
will
let
them
know
that
he
is
here
.
See
,
see
;
the
knaves
are
getting
in
*NL*
that
clump
of
pines
,
like
bees
settling
after
their
flight
.
By
the
*NL*
Lord
,
a
squaw
might
put
a
bullet
into
the
center
of
such
a
knot
of
dark
*NL*
skins
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
instant
the
whoop
was
given
,
and
a
dozen
Hurons
fell
by
a
*NL*
discharge
from
Chingachgook
and
his
band
.
The
shout
that
followed
was
*NL*
answered
by
a
single
war-cry
from
the
forest
,
and
a
yell
passed
through
*NL*
the
air
that
sounded
as
if
a
thousand
throats
were
united
in
a
common
*NL*
effort
.
The
Hurons
staggered
,
deserting
the
center
of
their
line
,
and
*NL*
Uncas
issued
from
the
forest
through
the
opening
they
left
,
at
the
head
*NL*
of
a
hundred
warriors
.
*NL*
*NL*
Waving
his
hands
right
and
left
,
the
young
chief
pointed
out
the
enemy
*NL*
to
his
followers
,
who
separated
in
pursuit
.
The
war
now
divided
,
both
*NL*
wings
of
the
broken
Hurons
seeking
protection
in
the
woods
again
,
hotly
*NL*
pressed
by
the
victorious
warriors
of
the
Lenape
.
A
minute
might
have
*NL*
passed
,
but
the
sounds
were
already
receding
in
different
directions
,
*NL*
and
gradually
losing
their
distinctness
beneath
the
echoing
arches
of
*NL*
the
woods
.
One
little
knot
of
Hurons
,
however
,
had
disdained
to
seek
a
*NL*
cover
,
and
were
retiring
,
like
lions
at
bay
,
slowly
and
sullenly
up
the
*NL*
acclivity
which
Chingachgook
and
his
band
had
just
deserted
,
to
mingle
*NL*
more
closely
in
the
fray
.
Magua
was
conspicuous
in
this
party
,
both
by
*NL*
his
fierce
and
savage
mien
,
and
by
the
air
of
haughty
authority
he
yet
*NL*
maintained
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
his
eagerness
to
expedite
the
pursuit
,
Uncas
had
left
himself
nearly
*NL*
alone
;
but
the
moment
his
eye
caught
the
figure
of
Le
Subtil
,
every
*NL*
other
consideration
was
forgotten
.
Raising
his
cry
of
battle
,
which
*NL*
recalled
some
six
or
seven
warriors
,
and
reckless
of
the
disparity
of
*NL*
their
numbers
,
he
rushed
upon
his
enemy
.
Le
Renard
,
who
watched
the
*NL*
movement
,
paused
to
receive
him
with
secret
joy
.
But
at
the
moment
when
*NL*
he
thought
the
rashness
of
his
impetuous
young
assailant
had
left
him
*NL*
at
his
mercy
,
another
shout
was
given
,
and
La
Longue
Carabine
was
seen
*NL*
rushing
to
the
rescue
,
attended
by
all
his
white
associates
.
The
Huron
*NL*
instantly
turned
,
and
commenced
a
rapid
retreat
up
the
ascent
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
time
for
greetings
or
congratulations
;
for
Uncas
,
though
*NL*
unconscious
of
the
presence
of
his
friends
,
continued
the
pursuit
with
*NL*
the
velocity
of
the
wind
.
In
vain
Hawkeye
called
to
him
to
respect
the
*NL*
covers
;
the
young
Mohican
braved
the
dangerous
fire
of
his
enemies
,
and
*NL*
soon
compelled
them
to
a
flight
as
swift
as
his
own
headlong
speed
.
It
*NL*
was
fortunate
that
the
race
was
of
short
continuance
,
and
that
the
white
*NL*
men
were
much
favored
by
their
position
,
or
the
Delaware
would
soon
have
*NL*
outstripped
all
his
companions
,
and
fallen
a
victim
to
his
own
temerity
.
*NL*
But
,
ere
such
a
calamity
could
happen
,
the
pursuers
and
pursued
entered
*NL*
the
Wyandot
village
,
within
striking
distance
of
each
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
Excited
by
the
presence
of
their
dwellings
,
and
tired
of
the
chase
,
the
*NL*
Hurons
now
made
a
stand
,
and
fought
around
their
council-lodge
with
*NL*
the
fury
of
despair
.
The
onset
and
the
issue
were
like
the
passage
and
*NL*
destruction
of
a
whirlwind
.
The
tomahawk
of
Uncas
,
the
blows
of
Hawkeye
,
*NL*
and
even
the
still
nervous
arm
of
Munro
were
all
busy
for
that
passing
*NL*
moment
,
and
the
ground
was
quickly
strewed
with
their
enemies
.
Still
*NL*
Magua
,
though
daring
and
much
exposed
,
escaped
from
every
effort
against
*NL*
his
life
,
with
that
sort
of
fabled
protection
that
was
made
to
overlook
*NL*
the
fortunes
of
favored
heroes
in
the
legends
of
ancient
poetry
.
Raising
*NL*
a
yell
that
spoke
volumes
of
anger
and
disappointment
,
the
subtle
chief
,
*NL*
when
he
saw
his
comrades
fallen
,
darted
away
from
the
place
,
attended
*NL*
by
his
two
only
surviving
friends
,
leaving
the
Delawares
engaged
in
*NL*
stripping
the
dead
of
the
bloody
trophies
of
their
victory
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Uncas
,
who
had
vainly
sought
him
in
the
melee
,
bounded
forward
in
*NL*
pursuit
;
Hawkeye
,
Heyward
and
David
still
pressing
on
his
footsteps
.
The
*NL*
utmost
that
the
scout
could
effect
,
was
to
keep
the
muzzle
of
his
rifle
*NL*
a
little
in
advance
of
his
friend
,
to
whom
,
however
,
it
answered
every
*NL*
purpose
of
a
charmed
shield
.
Once
Magua
appeared
disposed
to
make
*NL*
another
and
a
final
effort
to
revenge
his
losses
;
but
,
abandoning
his
*NL*
intention
as
soon
as
demonstrated
,
he
leaped
into
a
thicket
of
bushes
,
*NL*
through
which
he
was
followed
by
his
enemies
,
and
suddenly
entered
the
*NL*
mouth
of
the
cave
already
known
to
the
reader
.
Hawkeye
,
who
had
only
*NL*
forborne
to
fire
in
tenderness
to
Uncas
,
raised
a
shout
of
success
,
and
*NL*
proclaimed
aloud
that
now
they
were
certain
of
their
game
.
The
pursuers
*NL*
dashed
into
the
long
and
narrow
entrance
,
in
time
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
*NL*
the
retreating
forms
of
the
Hurons
.
Their
passage
through
the
natural
*NL*
galleries
and
subterraneous
apartments
of
the
cavern
was
preceded
by
the
*NL*
shrieks
and
cries
of
hundreds
of
women
and
children
.
The
place
,
seen
by
*NL*
its
dim
and
uncertain
light
,
appeared
like
the
shades
of
the
infernal
*NL*
regions
,
across
which
unhappy
ghosts
and
savage
demons
were
flitting
in
*NL*
multitudes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Still
Uncas
kept
his
eye
on
Magua
,
as
if
life
to
him
possessed
but
*NL*
a
single
object
.
Heyward
and
the
scout
still
pressed
on
his
rear
,
*NL*
actuated
,
though
possibly
in
a
less
degree
,
by
a
common
feeling
.
But
*NL*
their
way
was
becoming
intricate
,
in
those
dark
and
gloomy
passages
,
and
*NL*
the
glimpses
of
the
retiring
warriors
less
distinct
and
frequent
;
and
*NL*
for
a
moment
the
trace
was
believed
to
be
lost
,
when
a
white
robe
was
*NL*
seen
fluttering
in
the
further
extremity
of
a
passage
that
seemed
to
*NL*
lead
up
the
mountain
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
Cora
!
''
exclaimed
Heyward
,
in
a
voice
in
which
horror
and
delight
*NL*
were
wildly
mingled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cora
!
Cora
!
''
echoed
Uncas
,
bounding
forward
like
a
deer
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
the
maiden
!
''
shouted
the
scout
.
``
Courage
,
lady
;
we
come
!
we
come
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
chase
was
renewed
with
a
diligence
rendered
tenfold
encouraging
*NL*
by
this
glimpse
of
the
captive
.
But
the
way
was
rugged
,
broken
,
and
in
*NL*
spots
nearly
impassable
.
Uncas
abandoned
his
rifle
,
and
leaped
forward
*NL*
with
headlong
precipitation
.
Heyward
rashly
imitated
his
example
,
though
*NL*
both
were
,
a
moment
afterward
,
admonished
of
his
madness
by
hearing
the
*NL*
bellowing
of
a
piece
,
that
the
Hurons
found
time
to
discharge
down
the
*NL*
passage
in
the
rocks
,
the
bullet
from
which
even
gave
the
young
Mohican
*NL*
a
slight
wound
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
must
close
!
''
said
the
scout
,
passing
his
friends
by
a
desperate
*NL*
leap
;
``
the
knaves
will
pick
us
all
off
at
this
distance
;
and
see
,
they
*NL*
hold
the
maiden
so
as
to
shield
themselves
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Though
his
words
were
unheeded
,
or
rather
unheard
,
his
example
was
*NL*
followed
by
his
companions
,
who
,
by
incredible
exertions
,
got
near
*NL*
enough
to
the
fugitives
to
perceive
that
Cora
was
borne
along
between
*NL*
the
two
warriors
while
Magua
prescribed
the
direction
and
manner
of
*NL*
their
flight
.
At
this
moment
the
forms
of
all
four
were
strongly
drawn
*NL*
against
an
opening
in
the
sky
,
and
they
disappeared
.
Nearly
frantic
with
*NL*
disappointment
,
Uncas
and
Heyward
increased
efforts
that
already
seemed
*NL*
superhuman
,
and
they
issued
from
the
cavern
on
the
side
of
the
mountain
,
*NL*
in
time
to
note
the
route
of
the
pursued
.
The
course
lay
up
the
ascent
,
*NL*
and
still
continued
hazardous
and
laborious
.
*NL*
*NL*
Encumbered
by
his
rifle
,
and
,
perhaps
,
not
sustained
by
so
deep
an
*NL*
interest
in
the
captive
as
his
companions
,
the
scout
suffered
the
latter
*NL*
to
precede
him
a
little
,
Uncas
,
in
his
turn
,
taking
the
lead
of
Heyward
.
*NL*
In
this
manner
,
rocks
,
precipices
and
difficulties
were
surmounted
in
*NL*
an
incredibly
short
space
,
that
at
another
time
,
and
under
other
*NL*
circumstances
,
would
have
been
deemed
almost
insuperable
.
But
the
*NL*
impetuous
young
men
were
rewarded
by
finding
that
,
encumbered
with
Cora
,
*NL*
the
Hurons
were
losing
ground
in
the
race
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stay
,
dog
of
the
Wyandots
!
''
exclaimed
Uncas
,
shaking
his
bright
*NL*
tomahawk
at
Magua
;
``
a
Delaware
girl
calls
stay
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
go
no
further
!
''
cried
Cora
,
stopping
unexpectedly
on
a
ledge
*NL*
of
rock
,
that
overhung
a
deep
precipice
,
at
no
great
distance
from
the
*NL*
summit
of
the
mountain
.
``
Kill
me
if
thou
wilt
,
detestable
Huron
;
I
will
*NL*
go
no
further
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
supporters
of
the
maiden
raised
their
ready
tomahawks
with
the
*NL*
impious
joy
that
fiends
are
thought
to
take
in
mischief
,
but
Magua
*NL*
stayed
the
uplifted
arms
.
The
Huron
chief
,
after
casting
the
weapons
*NL*
he
had
wrested
from
his
companions
over
the
rock
,
drew
his
knife
,
*NL*
and
turned
to
his
captive
,
with
a
look
in
which
conflicting
passions
*NL*
fiercely
contended
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Woman
,
''
he
said
,
``
chose
;
the
wigwam
or
the
knife
of
Le
Subtil
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Cora
regarded
him
not
,
but
dropping
on
her
knees
,
she
raised
her
eyes
*NL*
and
stretched
her
arms
toward
heaven
,
saying
in
a
meek
and
yet
confiding
*NL*
voice
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
thine
;
do
with
me
as
thou
seest
best
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Woman
,
''
repeated
Magua
,
hoarsely
,
and
endeavoring
in
vain
to
catch
a
*NL*
glance
from
her
serene
and
beaming
eye
,
``
choose
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Cora
neither
heard
nor
heeded
his
demand
.
The
form
of
the
Huron
*NL*
trembled
in
every
fibre
,
and
he
raised
his
arm
on
high
,
but
dropped
*NL*
it
again
with
a
bewildered
air
,
like
one
who
doubted
.
Once
more
he
*NL*
struggled
with
himself
and
lifted
the
keen
weapon
again
;
but
just
then
*NL*
a
piercing
cry
was
heard
above
them
,
and
Uncas
appeared
,
leaping
*NL*
frantically
,
from
a
fearful
height
,
upon
the
ledge
.
Magua
recoiled
a
*NL*
step
;
and
one
of
his
assistants
,
profiting
by
the
chance
,
sheathed
his
*NL*
own
knife
in
the
bosom
of
Cora
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Huron
sprang
like
a
tiger
on
his
offending
and
already
retreating
*NL*
country
man
,
but
the
falling
form
of
Uncas
separated
the
unnatural
*NL*
combatants
.
Diverted
from
his
object
by
this
interruption
,
and
maddened
*NL*
by
the
murder
he
had
just
witnessed
,
Magua
buried
his
weapon
in
the
back
*NL*
of
the
prostrate
Delaware
,
uttering
an
unearthly
shout
as
he
committed
*NL*
the
dastardly
deed
.
But
Uncas
arose
from
the
blow
,
as
the
wounded
*NL*
panther
turns
upon
his
foe
,
and
struck
the
murderer
of
Cora
to
his
feet
,
*NL*
by
an
effort
in
which
the
last
of
his
failing
strength
was
expended
.
*NL*
Then
,
with
a
stern
and
steady
look
,
he
turned
to
Le
Subtil
,
and
*NL*
indicated
by
the
expression
of
his
eye
all
that
he
would
do
had
not
*NL*
the
power
deserted
him
.
The
latter
seized
the
nerveless
arm
of
the
*NL*
unresisting
Delaware
,
and
passed
his
knife
into
his
bosom
three
several
*NL*
times
,
before
his
victim
,
still
keeping
his
gaze
riveted
on
his
enemy
,
*NL*
with
a
look
of
inextinguishable
scorn
,
fell
dead
at
his
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mercy
!
mercy
!
Huron
,
''
cried
Heyward
,
from
above
,
in
tones
nearly
choked
*NL*
by
horror
;
``
give
mercy
,
and
thou
shalt
receive
from
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Whirling
the
bloody
knife
up
at
the
imploring
youth
,
the
victorious
*NL*
Magua
uttered
a
cry
so
fierce
,
so
wild
,
and
yet
so
joyous
,
that
it
*NL*
conveyed
the
sounds
of
savage
triumph
to
the
ears
of
those
who
fought
in
*NL*
the
valley
,
a
thousand
feet
below
.
He
was
answered
by
a
burst
from
the
*NL*
lips
of
the
scout
,
whose
tall
person
was
just
then
seen
moving
swiftly
*NL*
toward
him
,
along
those
dangerous
crags
,
with
steps
as
bold
and
reckless
*NL*
as
if
he
possessed
the
power
to
move
in
air
.
But
when
the
hunter
reached
*NL*
the
scene
of
the
ruthless
massacre
,
the
ledge
was
tenanted
only
by
the
*NL*
dead
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
keen
eye
took
a
single
look
at
the
victims
,
and
then
shot
its
*NL*
glances
over
the
difficulties
of
the
ascent
in
his
front
.
A
form
stood
*NL*
at
the
brow
of
the
mountain
,
on
the
very
edge
of
the
giddy
height
,
*NL*
with
uplifted
arms
,
in
an
awful
attitude
of
menace
.
Without
stopping
to
*NL*
consider
his
person
,
the
rifle
of
Hawkeye
was
raised
;
but
a
rock
,
which
*NL*
fell
on
the
head
of
one
of
the
fugitives
below
,
exposed
the
indignant
*NL*
and
glowing
countenance
of
the
honest
Gamut
.
Then
Magua
issued
from
a
*NL*
crevice
,
and
,
stepping
with
calm
indifference
over
the
body
of
the
last
*NL*
of
his
associates
,
he
leaped
a
wide
fissure
,
and
ascended
the
rocks
at
*NL*
a
point
where
the
arm
of
David
could
not
reach
him
.
A
single
bound
would
*NL*
carry
him
to
the
brow
of
the
precipice
,
and
assure
his
safety
.
Before
*NL*
taking
the
leap
,
however
,
the
Huron
paused
,
and
shaking
his
hand
at
the
*NL*
scout
,
he
shouted
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
pale
faces
are
dogs
!
the
Delawares
women
!
Magua
leaves
them
on
the
*NL*
rocks
,
for
the
crows
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Laughing
hoarsely
,
he
made
a
desperate
leap
,
and
fell
short
of
his
mark
,
*NL*
though
his
hands
grasped
a
shrub
on
the
verge
of
the
height
.
The
form
*NL*
of
Hawkeye
had
crouched
like
a
beast
about
to
take
its
spring
,
and
*NL*
his
frame
trembled
so
violently
with
eagerness
that
the
muzzle
of
the
*NL*
half-raised
rifle
played
like
a
leaf
fluttering
in
the
wind
.
Without
*NL*
exhausting
himself
with
fruitless
efforts
,
the
cunning
Magua
suffered
*NL*
his
body
to
drop
to
the
length
of
his
arms
,
and
found
a
fragment
for
his
*NL*
feet
to
rest
on
.
Then
,
summoning
all
his
powers
,
he
renewed
the
attempt
,
*NL*
and
so
far
succeeded
as
to
draw
his
knees
on
the
edge
of
the
mountain
.
*NL*
It
was
now
,
when
the
body
of
his
enemy
was
most
collected
together
,
*NL*
that
the
agitated
weapon
of
the
scout
was
drawn
to
his
shoulder
.
The
*NL*
surrounding
rocks
themselves
were
not
steadier
than
the
piece
became
,
*NL*
for
the
single
instant
that
it
poured
out
its
contents
.
The
arms
of
the
*NL*
Huron
relaxed
,
and
his
body
fell
back
a
little
,
while
his
knees
still
*NL*
kept
their
position
.
Turning
a
relentless
look
on
his
enemy
,
he
shook
*NL*
a
hand
in
grim
defiance
.
But
his
hold
loosened
,
and
his
dark
person
was
*NL*
seen
cutting
the
air
with
its
head
downward
,
for
a
fleeting
instant
,
*NL*
until
it
glided
past
the
fringe
of
shrubbery
which
clung
to
the
*NL*
mountain
,
in
its
rapid
flight
to
destruction
.

Halleck
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sun
found
the
Lenape
,
on
the
succeeding
day
,
a
nation
of
mourners
.
*NL*
The
sounds
of
the
battle
were
over
,
and
they
had
fed
fat
their
ancient
*NL*
grudge
,
and
had
avenged
their
recent
quarrel
with
the
Mengwe
,
by
the
*NL*
destruction
of
a
whole
community
.
The
black
and
murky
atmosphere
that
*NL*
floated
around
the
spot
where
the
Hurons
had
encamped
,
sufficiently
*NL*
announced
of
itself
,
the
fate
of
that
wandering
tribe
;
while
hundreds
of
*NL*
ravens
,
that
struggled
above
the
summits
of
the
mountains
,
or
swept
,
in
*NL*
noisy
flocks
,
across
the
wide
ranges
of
the
woods
,
furnished
a
frightful
*NL*
direction
to
the
scene
of
the
combat
.
In
short
,
any
eye
at
all
practised
*NL*
in
the
signs
of
a
frontier
warfare
might
easily
have
traced
all
those
*NL*
unerring
evidences
of
the
ruthless
results
which
attend
an
Indian
*NL*
vengeance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Still
,
the
sun
rose
on
the
Lenape
a
nation
of
mourners
.
No
shouts
*NL*
of
success
,
no
songs
of
triumph
,
were
heard
,
in
rejoicings
for
their
*NL*
victory
.
The
latest
straggler
had
returned
from
his
fell
employment
,
*NL*
only
to
strip
himself
of
the
terrific
emblems
of
his
bloody
calling
,
*NL*
and
to
join
in
the
lamentations
of
his
countrymen
,
as
a
stricken
people
.
*NL*
Pride
and
exultation
were
supplanted
by
humility
,
and
the
fiercest
*NL*
of
human
passions
was
already
succeeded
by
the
most
profound
and
*NL*
unequivocal
demonstrations
of
grief
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
lodges
were
deserted
;
but
a
broad
belt
of
earnest
faces
encircled
a
*NL*
spot
in
their
vicinity
,
whither
everything
possessing
life
had
repaired
,
*NL*
and
where
all
were
now
collected
,
in
deep
and
awful
silence
.
Though
*NL*
beings
of
every
rank
and
age
,
of
both
sexes
,
and
of
all
pursuits
,
had
*NL*
united
to
form
this
breathing
wall
of
bodies
,
they
were
influenced
by
a
*NL*
single
emotion
.
Each
eye
was
riveted
on
the
center
of
that
ring
,
which
*NL*
contained
the
objects
of
so
much
and
of
so
common
an
interest
.
*NL*
*NL*
Six
Delaware
girls
,
with
their
long
,
dark
,
flowing
tresses
falling
*NL*
loosely
across
their
bosoms
,
stood
apart
,
and
only
gave
proof
of
their
*NL*
existence
as
they
occasionally
strewed
sweet-scented
herbs
and
forest
*NL*
flowers
on
a
litter
of
fragrant
plants
that
,
under
a
pall
of
Indian
*NL*
robes
,
supported
all
that
now
remained
of
the
ardent
,
high-souled
,
*NL*
and
generous
Cora
.
Her
form
was
concealed
in
many
wrappers
of
the
same
*NL*
simple
manufacture
,
and
her
face
was
shut
forever
from
the
gaze
of
*NL*
men
.
At
her
feet
was
seated
the
desolate
Munro
.
His
aged
head
was
*NL*
bowed
nearly
to
the
earth
,
in
compelled
submission
to
the
stroke
of
*NL*
Providence
;
but
a
hidden
anguish
struggled
about
his
furrowed
brow
,
*NL*
that
was
only
partially
concealed
by
the
careless
locks
of
gray
that
*NL*
had
fallen
,
neglected
,
on
his
temples
.
Gamut
stood
at
his
side
,
his
*NL*
meek
head
bared
to
the
rays
of
the
sun
,
while
his
eyes
,
wandering
and
*NL*
concerned
,
seemed
to
be
equally
divided
between
that
little
volume
,
*NL*
which
contained
so
many
quaint
but
holy
maxims
,
and
the
being
in
whose
*NL*
behalf
his
soul
yearned
to
administer
consolation
.
Heyward
was
also
*NL*
nigh
,
supporting
himself
against
a
tree
,
and
endeavoring
to
keep
down
*NL*
those
sudden
risings
of
sorrow
that
it
required
his
utmost
manhood
to
*NL*
subdue
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
sad
and
melancholy
as
this
group
may
easily
be
imagined
,
it
was
far
*NL*
less
touching
than
another
,
that
occupied
the
opposite
space
of
the
same
*NL*
area
.
Seated
,
as
in
life
,
with
his
form
and
limbs
arranged
in
grave
and
*NL*
decent
composure
,
Uncas
appeared
,
arrayed
in
the
most
gorgeous
ornaments
*NL*
that
the
wealth
of
the
tribe
could
furnish
.
Rich
plumes
nodded
above
*NL*
his
head
;
wampum
,
gorgets
,
bracelets
,
and
medals
,
adorned
his
person
*NL*
in
profusion
;
though
his
dull
eye
and
vacant
lineaments
too
strongly
*NL*
contradicted
the
idle
tale
of
pride
they
would
convey
.
*NL*
*NL*
Directly
in
front
of
the
corpse
Chingachgook
was
placed
,
without
arms
,
*NL*
paint
or
adornment
of
any
sort
,
except
the
bright
blue
blazonry
of
his
*NL*
race
,
that
was
indelibly
impressed
on
his
naked
bosom
.
During
the
long
*NL*
period
that
the
tribe
had
thus
been
collected
,
the
Mohican
warrior
had
*NL*
kept
a
steady
,
anxious
look
on
the
cold
and
senseless
countenance
of
his
*NL*
son
.
So
riveted
and
intense
had
been
that
gaze
,
and
so
changeless
his
*NL*
attitude
,
that
a
stranger
might
not
have
told
the
living
from
the
dead
,
*NL*
but
for
the
occasional
gleamings
of
a
troubled
spirit
,
that
shot
athwart
*NL*
the
dark
visage
of
one
,
and
the
deathlike
calm
that
had
forever
settled
*NL*
on
the
lineaments
of
the
other
.
The
scout
was
hard
by
,
leaning
in
a
*NL*
pensive
posture
on
his
own
fatal
and
avenging
weapon
;
while
Tamenund
,
*NL*
supported
by
the
elders
of
his
nation
,
occupied
a
high
place
at
hand
,
*NL*
whence
he
might
look
down
on
the
mute
and
sorrowful
assemblage
of
his
*NL*
people
.
*NL*
*NL*
Just
within
the
inner
edge
of
the
circle
stood
a
soldier
,
in
the
*NL*
military
attire
of
a
strange
nation
;
and
without
it
was
his
warhorse
,
in
*NL*
the
center
of
a
collection
of
mounted
domestics
,
seemingly
in
readiness
*NL*
to
undertake
some
distant
journey
.
The
vestments
of
the
stranger
*NL*
announced
him
to
be
one
who
held
a
responsible
situation
near
the
person
*NL*
of
the
captain
of
the
Canadas
;
and
who
,
as
it
would
now
seem
,
finding
*NL*
his
errand
of
peace
frustrated
by
the
fierce
impetuosity
of
his
allies
,
*NL*
was
content
to
become
a
silent
and
sad
spectator
of
the
fruits
of
a
*NL*
contest
that
he
had
arrived
too
late
to
anticipate
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
day
was
drawing
to
the
close
of
its
first
quarter
,
and
yet
had
the
*NL*
multitude
maintained
its
breathing
stillness
since
its
dawn
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
sound
louder
than
a
stifled
sob
had
been
heard
among
them
,
nor
had
*NL*
even
a
limb
been
moved
throughout
that
long
and
painful
period
,
except
*NL*
to
perform
the
simple
and
touching
offerings
that
were
made
,
from
time
*NL*
to
time
,
in
commemoration
of
the
dead
.
The
patience
and
forbearance
of
*NL*
Indian
fortitude
could
alone
support
such
an
appearance
of
abstraction
,
*NL*
as
seemed
now
to
have
turned
each
dark
and
motionless
figure
into
stone
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
,
the
sage
of
the
Delawares
stretched
forth
an
arm
,
and
leaning
*NL*
on
the
shoulders
of
his
attendants
,
he
arose
with
an
air
as
feeble
as
*NL*
if
another
age
had
already
intervened
between
the
man
who
had
met
his
*NL*
nation
the
preceding
day
,
and
him
who
now
tottered
on
his
elevated
*NL*
stand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Men
of
the
Lenape
!
''
he
said
,
in
low
,
hollow
tones
,
that
sounded
like
a
*NL*
voice
charged
with
some
prophetic
mission
:
``
the
face
of
the
Manitou
*NL*
is
behind
a
cloud
!
His
eye
is
turned
from
you
;
His
ears
are
shut
;
His
*NL*
tongue
gives
no
answer
.
You
see
him
not
;
yet
His
judgments
are
before
*NL*
you
.
Let
your
hearts
be
open
and
your
spirits
tell
no
lie
.
Men
of
the
*NL*
Lenape
!
the
face
of
the
Manitou
is
behind
a
cloud
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
this
simple
and
yet
terrible
annunciation
stole
on
the
ears
of
the
*NL*
multitude
,
a
stillness
as
deep
and
awful
succeeded
as
if
the
venerated
*NL*
spirit
they
worshiped
had
uttered
the
words
without
the
aid
of
human
*NL*
organs
;
and
even
the
inanimate
Uncas
appeared
a
being
of
life
,
compared
*NL*
with
the
humbled
and
submissive
throng
by
whom
he
was
surrounded
.
As
the
*NL*
immediate
effect
,
however
,
gradually
passed
away
,
a
low
murmur
of
voices
*NL*
commenced
a
sort
of
chant
in
honor
of
the
dead
.
The
sounds
were
those
of
*NL*
females
,
and
were
thrillingly
soft
and
wailing
.
The
words
were
connected
*NL*
by
no
regular
continuation
,
but
as
one
ceased
another
took
up
the
*NL*
eulogy
,
or
lamentation
,
whichever
it
might
be
called
,
and
gave
vent
to
*NL*
her
emotions
in
such
language
as
was
suggested
by
her
feelings
and
the
*NL*
occasion
.
At
intervals
the
speaker
was
interrupted
by
general
and
loud
*NL*
bursts
of
sorrow
,
during
which
the
girls
around
the
bier
of
Cora
plucked
*NL*
the
plants
and
flowers
blindly
from
her
body
,
as
if
bewildered
with
*NL*
grief
.
But
,
in
the
milder
moments
of
their
plaint
,
these
emblems
of
*NL*
purity
and
sweetness
were
cast
back
to
their
places
,
with
every
sign
*NL*
of
tenderness
and
regret
.
Though
rendered
less
connected
by
many
and
*NL*
general
interruptions
and
outbreakings
,
a
translation
of
their
language
*NL*
would
have
contained
a
regular
descant
,
which
,
in
substance
,
might
have
*NL*
proved
to
possess
a
train
of
consecutive
ideas
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
girl
,
selected
for
the
task
by
her
rank
and
qualifications
,
*NL*
commenced
by
modest
allusions
to
the
qualities
of
the
deceased
warrior
,
*NL*
embellishing
her
expressions
with
those
oriental
images
that
the
*NL*
Indians
have
probably
brought
with
them
from
the
extremes
of
the
other
*NL*
continent
,
and
which
form
of
themselves
a
link
to
connect
the
ancient
*NL*
histories
of
the
two
worlds
.
She
called
him
the
``
panther
of
his
tribe
''
;
*NL*
and
described
him
as
one
whose
moccasin
left
no
trail
on
the
dews
;
whose
*NL*
bound
was
like
the
leap
of
a
young
fawn
;
whose
eye
was
brighter
than
*NL*
a
star
in
the
dark
night
;
and
whose
voice
,
in
battle
,
was
loud
as
the
*NL*
thunder
of
the
Manitou
.
She
reminded
him
of
the
mother
who
bore
him
,
and
*NL*
dwelt
forcibly
on
the
happiness
she
must
feel
in
possessing
such
a
son
.
*NL*
She
bade
him
tell
her
,
when
they
met
in
the
world
of
spirits
,
that
the
*NL*
Delaware
girls
had
shed
tears
above
the
grave
of
her
child
,
and
had
*NL*
called
her
blessed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
they
who
succeeded
,
changing
their
tones
to
a
milder
and
still
*NL*
more
tender
strain
,
alluded
,
with
the
delicacy
and
sensitiveness
of
*NL*
women
,
to
the
stranger
maiden
,
who
had
left
the
upper
earth
at
a
time
*NL*
so
near
his
own
departure
,
as
to
render
the
will
of
the
Great
Spirit
too
*NL*
manifest
to
be
disregarded
.
They
admonished
him
to
be
kind
to
her
,
and
*NL*
to
have
consideration
for
her
ignorance
of
those
arts
which
were
so
*NL*
necessary
to
the
comfort
of
a
warrior
like
himself
.
They
dwelled
upon
*NL*
her
matchless
beauty
,
and
on
her
noble
resolution
,
without
the
taint
of
*NL*
envy
,
and
as
angels
may
be
thought
to
delight
in
a
superior
excellence
;
*NL*
adding
,
that
these
endowments
should
prove
more
than
equivalent
for
any
*NL*
little
imperfection
in
her
education
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
which
,
others
again
,
in
due
succession
,
spoke
to
the
maiden
*NL*
herself
,
in
the
low
,
soft
language
of
tenderness
and
love
.
They
exhorted
*NL*
her
to
be
of
cheerful
mind
,
and
to
fear
nothing
for
her
future
welfare
.
*NL*
A
hunter
would
be
her
companion
,
who
knew
how
to
provide
for
her
*NL*
smallest
wants
;
and
a
warrior
was
at
her
side
who
was
able
to
protect
*NL*
he
against
every
danger
.
They
promised
that
her
path
should
be
pleasant
,
*NL*
and
her
burden
light
.
They
cautioned
her
against
unavailing
regrets
for
*NL*
the
friends
of
her
youth
,
and
the
scenes
where
her
father
had
dwelt
;
*NL*
assuring
her
that
the
``
blessed
hunting
grounds
of
the
Lenape
,
''
contained
*NL*
vales
as
pleasant
,
streams
as
pure
;
and
flowers
as
sweet
,
as
the
``
heaven
*NL*
of
the
pale
faces
.
''
They
advised
her
to
be
attentive
to
the
wants
of
her
*NL*
companion
,
and
never
to
forget
the
distinction
which
the
Manitou
had
so
*NL*
wisely
established
between
them
.
Then
,
in
a
wild
burst
of
their
chant
*NL*
they
sang
with
united
voices
the
temper
of
the
Mohican
's
mind
.
They
*NL*
pronounced
him
noble
,
manly
and
generous
;
all
that
became
a
warrior
,
and
*NL*
all
that
a
maid
might
love
.
Clothing
their
ideas
in
the
most
remote
*NL*
and
subtle
images
,
they
betrayed
,
that
,
in
the
short
period
of
their
*NL*
intercourse
,
they
had
discovered
,
with
the
intuitive
perception
of
their
*NL*
sex
,
the
truant
disposition
of
his
inclinations
.
The
Delaware
girls
had
*NL*
found
no
favor
in
his
eyes
!
He
was
of
a
race
that
had
once
been
lords
on
*NL*
the
shores
of
the
salt
lake
,
and
his
wishes
had
led
him
back
to
a
*NL*
people
who
dwelt
about
the
graves
of
his
fathers
.
Why
should
not
such
*NL*
a
predilection
be
encouraged
!
That
she
was
of
a
blood
purer
and
richer
*NL*
than
the
rest
of
her
nation
,
any
eye
might
have
seen
;
that
she
was
*NL*
equal
to
the
dangers
and
daring
of
a
life
in
the
woods
,
her
conduct
*NL*
had
proved
;
and
now
,
they
added
,
the
``
wise
one
of
the
earth
''
had
*NL*
transplanted
her
to
a
place
where
she
would
find
congenial
spirits
,
and
*NL*
might
be
forever
happy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
with
another
transition
in
voice
and
subject
,
allusions
were
*NL*
made
to
the
virgin
who
wept
in
the
adjacent
lodge
.
They
compared
her
to
*NL*
flakes
of
snow
;
as
pure
,
as
white
,
as
brilliant
,
and
as
liable
to
melt
*NL*
in
the
fierce
heats
of
summer
,
or
congeal
in
the
frosts
of
winter
.
They
*NL*
doubted
not
that
she
was
lovely
in
the
eyes
of
the
young
chief
,
whose
*NL*
skin
and
whose
sorrow
seemed
so
like
her
own
;
but
though
far
from
*NL*
expressing
such
a
preference
,
it
was
evident
they
deemed
her
less
*NL*
excellent
than
the
maid
they
mourned
.
Still
they
denied
her
no
need
*NL*
her
rare
charms
might
properly
claim
.
Her
ringlets
were
compared
to
the
*NL*
exuberant
tendrils
of
the
vine
,
her
eye
to
the
blue
vault
of
heavens
,
*NL*
and
the
most
spotless
cloud
,
with
its
glowing
flush
of
the
sun
,
was
*NL*
admitted
to
be
less
attractive
than
her
bloom
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
these
and
similar
songs
nothing
was
audible
but
the
murmurs
of
*NL*
the
music
;
relieved
,
as
it
was
,
or
rather
rendered
terrible
,
by
those
*NL*
occasional
bursts
of
grief
which
might
be
called
its
choruses
.
The
*NL*
Delawares
themselves
listened
like
charmed
men
;
and
it
was
very
*NL*
apparent
,
by
the
variations
of
their
speaking
countenances
,
how
deep
and
*NL*
true
was
their
sympathy
.
Even
David
was
not
reluctant
to
lend
his
ears
*NL*
to
the
tones
of
voices
so
sweet
;
and
long
ere
the
chant
was
ended
,
his
*NL*
gaze
announced
that
his
soul
was
enthralled
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
scout
,
to
whom
alone
,
of
all
the
white
men
,
the
words
were
*NL*
intelligible
,
suffered
himself
to
be
a
little
aroused
from
his
*NL*
meditative
posture
,
and
bent
his
face
aside
,
to
catch
their
meaning
,
as
*NL*
the
girls
proceeded
.
But
when
they
spoke
of
the
future
prospects
of
*NL*
Cora
and
Uncas
,
he
shook
his
head
,
like
one
who
knew
the
error
of
their
*NL*
simple
creed
,
and
resuming
his
reclining
attitude
,
he
maintained
it
*NL*
until
the
ceremony
,
if
that
might
be
called
a
ceremony
,
in
which
feeling
*NL*
was
so
deeply
imbued
,
was
finished
.
Happily
for
the
self-command
of
both
*NL*
Heyward
and
Munro
,
they
knew
not
the
meaning
of
the
wild
sounds
they
*NL*
heard
.
*NL*
*NL*
Chingachgook
was
a
solitary
exception
to
the
interest
manifested
by
the
*NL*
native
part
of
the
audience
.
His
look
never
changed
throughout
the
whole
*NL*
of
the
scene
,
nor
did
a
muscle
move
in
his
rigid
countenance
,
even
at
*NL*
the
wildest
or
the
most
pathetic
parts
of
the
lamentation
.
The
cold
and
*NL*
senseless
remains
of
his
son
was
all
to
him
,
and
every
other
sense
but
*NL*
that
of
sight
seemed
frozen
,
in
order
that
his
eyes
might
take
their
*NL*
final
gaze
at
those
lineaments
he
had
so
long
loved
,
and
which
were
now
*NL*
about
to
be
closed
forever
from
his
view
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
stage
of
the
obsequies
,
a
warrior
much
renowned
for
deed
in
*NL*
arms
,
and
more
especially
for
services
in
the
recent
combat
,
a
man
of
*NL*
stern
and
grave
demeanor
,
advanced
slowly
from
the
crowd
,
and
placed
*NL*
himself
nigh
the
person
of
the
dead
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
hast
thou
left
us
,
pride
of
the
Wapanachki
?
''
he
said
,
addressing
*NL*
himself
to
the
dull
ears
of
Uncas
,
as
if
the
empty
clay
retained
the
*NL*
faculties
of
the
animated
man
;
``
thy
time
has
been
like
that
of
the
sun
*NL*
when
in
the
trees
;
thy
glory
brighter
than
his
light
at
noonday
.
Thou
*NL*
art
gone
,
youthful
warrior
,
but
a
hundred
Wyandots
are
clearing
the
*NL*
briers
from
thy
path
to
the
world
of
the
spirits
.
Who
that
saw
thee
in
*NL*
battle
would
believe
that
thou
couldst
die
?
Who
before
thee
has
ever
*NL*
shown
Uttawa
the
way
into
the
fight
?
Thy
feet
were
like
the
wings
of
*NL*
eagles
;
thine
arm
heavier
than
falling
branches
from
the
pine
;
and
*NL*
thy
voice
like
the
Manitou
when
He
speaks
in
the
clouds
.
The
tongue
of
*NL*
Uttawa
is
weak
,
''
he
added
,
looking
about
him
with
a
melancholy
gaze
,
*NL*
``
and
his
heart
exceeding
heavy
.
Pride
of
the
Wapanachki
,
why
hast
thou
*NL*
left
us
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
succeeded
by
others
,
in
due
order
,
until
most
of
the
high
and
*NL*
gifted
men
of
the
nation
had
sung
or
spoken
their
tribute
of
praise
over
*NL*
the
manes
of
the
deceased
chief
.
When
each
had
ended
,
another
deep
and
*NL*
breathing
silence
reigned
in
all
the
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
a
low
,
deep
sound
was
heard
,
like
the
suppressed
accompaniment
of
*NL*
distant
music
,
rising
just
high
enough
on
the
air
to
be
audible
,
and
*NL*
yet
so
indistinctly
,
as
to
leave
its
character
,
and
the
place
whence
it
*NL*
proceeded
,
alike
matters
of
conjecture
.
It
was
,
however
,
succeeded
by
*NL*
another
and
another
strain
,
each
in
a
higher
key
,
until
they
grew
on
the
*NL*
ear
,
first
in
long
drawn
and
often
repeated
interjections
,
and
finally
*NL*
in
words
.
The
lips
of
Chingachgook
had
so
far
parted
,
as
to
announce
*NL*
that
it
was
the
monody
of
the
father
.
Though
not
an
eye
was
turned
*NL*
toward
him
nor
the
smallest
sign
of
impatience
exhibited
,
it
was
*NL*
apparent
,
by
the
manner
in
which
the
multitude
elevated
their
heads
to
*NL*
listen
,
that
they
drank
in
the
sounds
with
an
intenseness
of
attention
,
*NL*
that
none
but
Tamenund
himself
had
ever
before
commanded
.
But
*NL*
they
listened
in
vain
.
The
strains
rose
just
so
loud
as
to
become
*NL*
intelligible
,
and
then
grew
fainter
and
more
trembling
,
until
they
*NL*
finally
sank
on
the
ear
,
as
if
borne
away
by
a
passing
breath
of
wind
.
*NL*
The
lips
of
the
Sagamore
closed
,
and
he
remained
silent
in
his
seat
,
*NL*
looking
with
his
riveted
eye
and
motionless
form
,
like
some
creature
*NL*
that
had
been
turned
from
the
Almighty
hand
with
the
form
but
without
*NL*
the
spirit
of
a
man
.
The
Delawares
who
knew
by
these
symptoms
that
*NL*
the
mind
of
their
friend
was
not
prepared
for
so
mighty
an
effort
of
*NL*
fortitude
,
relaxed
in
their
attention
;
and
,
with
an
innate
delicacy
,
*NL*
seemed
to
bestow
all
their
thoughts
on
the
obsequies
of
the
stranger
*NL*
maiden
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
signal
was
given
,
by
one
of
the
elder
chiefs
,
to
the
women
who
crowded
*NL*
that
part
of
the
circle
near
which
the
body
of
Cora
lay
.
Obedient
to
*NL*
the
sign
,
the
girls
raised
the
bier
to
the
elevation
of
their
heads
,
*NL*
and
advanced
with
slow
and
regulated
steps
,
chanting
,
as
they
proceeded
,
*NL*
another
wailing
song
in
praise
of
the
deceased
.
Gamut
,
who
had
been
a
*NL*
close
observer
of
rites
he
deemed
so
heathenish
,
now
bent
his
head
over
*NL*
the
shoulder
of
the
unconscious
father
,
whispering
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
move
with
the
remains
of
thy
child
;
shall
we
not
follow
,
and
see
*NL*
them
interred
with
Christian
burial
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Munro
started
,
as
if
the
last
trumpet
had
sounded
in
his
ear
,
and
*NL*
bestowing
one
anxious
and
hurried
glance
around
him
,
he
arose
and
*NL*
followed
in
the
simple
train
,
with
the
mien
of
a
soldier
,
but
bearing
*NL*
the
full
burden
of
a
parent
's
suffering
.
His
friends
pressed
around
him
*NL*
with
a
sorrow
that
was
too
strong
to
be
termed
sympathy
--
even
the
young
*NL*
Frenchman
joining
in
the
procession
,
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
was
*NL*
sensibly
touched
at
the
early
and
melancholy
fate
of
one
so
lovely
.
But
*NL*
when
the
last
and
humblest
female
of
the
tribe
had
joined
in
the
wild
*NL*
and
yet
ordered
array
,
the
men
of
the
Lenape
contracted
their
circle
,
*NL*
and
formed
again
around
the
person
of
Uncas
,
as
silent
,
as
grave
,
and
as
*NL*
motionless
as
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
place
which
had
been
chosen
for
the
grave
of
Cora
was
a
little
*NL*
knoll
,
where
a
cluster
of
young
and
healthful
pines
had
taken
root
,
*NL*
forming
of
themselves
a
melancholy
and
appropriate
shade
over
the
spot
.
*NL*
On
reaching
it
the
girls
deposited
their
burden
,
and
continued
for
many
*NL*
minutes
waiting
,
with
characteristic
patience
,
and
native
timidity
,
for
*NL*
some
evidence
that
they
whose
feelings
were
most
concerned
were
content
*NL*
with
the
arrangement
.
At
length
the
scout
,
who
alone
understood
their
*NL*
habits
,
said
,
in
their
own
language
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
daughters
have
done
well
;
the
white
men
thank
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Satisfied
with
this
testimony
in
their
favor
,
the
girls
proceeded
*NL*
to
deposit
the
body
in
a
shell
,
ingeniously
,
and
not
inelegantly
,
*NL*
fabricated
of
the
bark
of
the
birch
;
after
which
they
lowered
it
into
*NL*
its
dark
and
final
abode
.
The
ceremony
of
covering
the
remains
,
and
*NL*
concealing
the
marks
of
the
fresh
earth
,
by
leaves
and
other
natural
and
*NL*
customary
objects
,
was
conducted
with
the
same
simple
and
silent
forms
.
*NL*
But
when
the
labors
of
the
kind
beings
who
had
performed
these
sad
and
*NL*
friendly
offices
were
so
far
completed
,
they
hesitated
,
in
a
way
to
show
*NL*
that
they
knew
not
how
much
further
they
might
proceed
.
It
was
in
this
*NL*
stage
of
the
rites
that
the
scout
again
addressed
them
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
young
women
have
done
enough
,
''
he
said
:
``
the
spirit
of
the
pale
*NL*
face
has
no
need
of
food
or
raiment
,
their
gifts
being
according
to
the
*NL*
heaven
of
their
color
.
I
see
,
''
he
added
,
glancing
an
eye
at
David
,
who
*NL*
was
preparing
his
book
in
a
manner
that
indicated
an
intention
to
*NL*
lead
the
way
in
sacred
song
,
``
that
one
who
better
knows
the
Christian
*NL*
fashions
is
about
to
speak
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
females
stood
modestly
aside
,
and
,
from
having
been
the
principal
*NL*
actors
in
the
scene
,
they
now
became
the
meek
and
attentive
observers
of
*NL*
that
which
followed
.
During
the
time
David
occupied
in
pouring
out
the
*NL*
pious
feelings
of
his
spirit
in
this
manner
,
not
a
sign
of
surprise
,
nor
*NL*
a
look
of
impatience
,
escaped
them
.
They
listened
like
those
who
knew
*NL*
the
meaning
of
the
strange
words
,
and
appeared
as
if
they
felt
the
*NL*
mingled
emotions
of
sorrow
,
hope
,
and
resignation
,
they
were
intended
to
*NL*
convey
.
*NL*
*NL*
Excited
by
the
scene
he
had
just
witnessed
,
and
perhaps
influenced
by
*NL*
his
own
secret
emotions
,
the
master
of
song
exceeded
his
usual
efforts
.
*NL*
His
full
rich
voice
was
not
found
to
suffer
by
a
comparison
with
the
*NL*
soft
tones
of
the
girls
;
and
his
more
modulated
strains
possessed
,
at
*NL*
least
for
the
ears
of
those
to
whom
they
were
peculiarly
addressed
,
*NL*
the
additional
power
of
intelligence
.
He
ended
the
anthem
,
as
he
had
*NL*
commenced
it
,
in
the
midst
of
a
grave
and
solemn
stillness
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
,
however
,
the
closing
cadence
had
fallen
on
the
ears
of
his
*NL*
auditors
,
the
secret
,
timorous
glances
of
the
eyes
,
and
the
general
*NL*
and
yet
subdued
movement
of
the
assemblage
,
betrayed
that
something
was
*NL*
expected
from
the
father
of
the
deceased
.
Munro
seemed
sensible
that
the
*NL*
time
was
come
for
him
to
exert
what
is
,
perhaps
,
the
greatest
effort
*NL*
of
which
human
nature
is
capable
.
He
bared
his
gray
locks
,
and
looked
*NL*
around
the
timid
and
quiet
throng
by
which
he
was
encircled
,
with
a
firm
*NL*
and
collected
countenance
.
Then
,
motioning
with
his
hand
for
the
scout
*NL*
to
listen
,
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
to
these
kind
and
gentle
females
,
that
a
heart-broken
and
failing
*NL*
man
returns
them
his
thanks
.
Tell
them
,
that
the
Being
we
all
worship
,
*NL*
under
different
names
,
will
be
mindful
of
their
charity
;
and
that
the
*NL*
time
shall
not
be
distant
when
we
may
assemble
around
His
throne
without
*NL*
distinction
of
sex
,
or
rank
,
or
color
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
scout
listened
to
the
tremulous
voice
in
which
the
veteran
delivered
*NL*
these
words
,
and
shook
his
head
slowly
when
they
were
ended
,
as
one
who
*NL*
doubted
their
efficacy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
tell
them
this
,
''
he
said
,
``
would
be
to
tell
them
that
the
snows
come
*NL*
not
in
the
winter
,
or
that
the
sun
shines
fiercest
when
the
trees
are
*NL*
stripped
of
their
leaves
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
turning
to
the
women
,
he
made
such
a
communication
of
the
other
's
*NL*
gratitude
as
he
deemed
most
suited
to
the
capacities
of
his
listeners
.
*NL*
The
head
of
Munro
had
already
sunk
upon
his
chest
,
and
he
was
again
*NL*
fast
relapsing
into
melancholy
,
when
the
young
Frenchman
before
named
*NL*
ventured
to
touch
him
lightly
on
the
elbow
.
As
soon
as
he
had
gained
the
*NL*
attention
of
the
mourning
old
man
,
he
pointed
toward
a
group
of
young
*NL*
Indians
,
who
approached
with
a
light
but
closely
covered
litter
,
and
*NL*
then
pointed
upward
toward
the
sun
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
understand
you
,
sir
,
''
returned
Munro
,
with
a
voice
of
forced
*NL*
firmness
;
``
I
understand
you
.
It
is
the
will
of
Heaven
,
and
I
submit
.
*NL*
Cora
,
my
child
!
if
the
prayers
of
a
heart-broken
father
could
avail
thee
*NL*
now
,
how
blessed
shouldst
thou
be
!
Come
,
gentlemen
,
''
he
added
,
looking
*NL*
about
him
with
an
air
of
lofty
composure
,
though
the
anguish
that
*NL*
quivered
in
his
faded
countenance
was
far
too
powerful
to
be
concealed
,
*NL*
``
our
duty
here
is
ended
;
let
us
depart
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Heyward
gladly
obeyed
a
summons
that
took
them
from
a
spot
where
,
each
*NL*
instant
,
he
felt
his
self-control
was
about
to
desert
him
.
While
his
*NL*
companions
were
mounting
,
however
,
he
found
time
to
press
the
hand
of
*NL*
the
scout
,
and
to
repeat
the
terms
of
an
engagement
they
had
made
to
*NL*
meet
again
within
the
posts
of
the
British
army
.
Then
,
gladly
throwing
*NL*
himself
into
the
saddle
,
he
spurred
his
charger
to
the
side
of
the
*NL*
litter
,
whence
low
and
stifled
sobs
alone
announced
the
presence
of
*NL*
Alice
.
In
this
manner
,
the
head
of
Munro
again
drooping
on
his
bosom
,
*NL*
with
Heyward
and
David
following
in
sorrowing
silence
,
and
attended
*NL*
by
the
aide
of
Montcalm
with
his
guard
,
all
the
white
men
,
with
the
*NL*
exception
of
Hawkeye
,
passed
from
before
the
eyes
of
the
Delawares
,
and
*NL*
were
buried
in
the
vast
forests
of
that
region
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
tie
which
,
through
their
common
calamity
,
had
united
the
*NL*
feelings
of
these
simple
dwellers
in
the
woods
with
the
strangers
who
*NL*
had
thus
transiently
visited
them
,
was
not
so
easily
broken
.
Years
*NL*
passed
away
before
the
traditionary
tale
of
the
white
maiden
,
and
of
*NL*
the
young
warrior
of
the
Mohicans
ceased
to
beguile
the
long
nights
and
*NL*
tedious
marches
,
or
to
animate
their
youthful
and
brave
with
a
desire
*NL*
for
vengeance
.
Neither
were
the
secondary
actors
in
these
momentous
*NL*
incidents
forgotten
.
Through
the
medium
of
the
scout
,
who
served
for
*NL*
years
afterward
as
a
link
between
them
and
civilized
life
,
they
learned
,
*NL*
in
answer
to
their
inquiries
,
that
the
``
Gray
Head
''
was
speedily
gathered
*NL*
to
his
fathers
--
borne
down
,
as
was
erroneously
believed
,
by
his
military
*NL*
misfortunes
;
and
that
the
``
Open
Hand
''
had
conveyed
his
surviving
*NL*
daughter
far
into
the
settlements
of
the
pale
faces
,
where
her
tears
*NL*
had
at
last
ceased
to
flow
,
and
had
been
succeeded
by
the
bright
smiles
*NL*
which
were
better
suited
to
her
joyous
nature
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
these
were
events
of
a
time
later
than
that
which
concerns
our
tale
.
*NL*
Deserted
by
all
of
his
color
,
Hawkeye
returned
to
the
spot
where
his
*NL*
sympathies
led
him
,
with
a
force
that
no
ideal
bond
of
union
could
*NL*
destroy
.
He
was
just
in
time
to
catch
a
parting
look
of
the
features
of
*NL*
Uncas
,
whom
the
Delawares
were
already
inclosing
in
his
last
vestment
*NL*
of
skins
.
They
paused
to
permit
the
longing
and
lingering
gaze
of
the
*NL*
sturdy
woodsman
,
and
when
it
was
ended
,
the
body
was
enveloped
,
never
to
*NL*
be
unclosed
again
.
Then
came
a
procession
like
the
other
,
and
the
whole
*NL*
nation
was
collected
about
the
temporary
grave
of
the
chief
--
temporary
,
*NL*
because
it
was
proper
that
,
at
some
future
day
,
his
bones
should
rest
*NL*
among
those
of
his
own
people
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
movement
,
like
the
feeling
,
had
been
simultaneous
and
general
.
The
*NL*
same
grave
expression
of
grief
,
the
same
rigid
silence
,
and
the
same
*NL*
deference
to
the
principal
mourner
,
were
observed
around
the
place
of
*NL*
interment
as
have
been
already
described
.
The
body
was
deposited
in
an
*NL*
attitude
of
repose
,
facing
the
rising
sun
,
with
the
implements
of
war
*NL*
and
of
the
chase
at
hand
,
in
readiness
for
the
final
journey
.
An
opening
*NL*
was
left
in
the
shell
,
by
which
it
was
protected
from
the
soil
,
for
the
*NL*
spirit
to
communicate
with
its
earthly
tenement
,
when
necessary
;
and
the
*NL*
whole
was
concealed
from
the
instinct
,
and
protected
from
the
ravages
*NL*
of
the
beasts
of
prey
,
with
an
ingenuity
peculiar
to
the
natives
.
The
*NL*
manual
rites
then
ceased
and
all
present
reverted
to
the
more
spiritual
*NL*
part
of
the
ceremonies
.
*NL*
*NL*
Chingachgook
became
once
more
the
object
of
the
common
attention
.
He
had
*NL*
not
yet
spoken
,
and
something
consolatory
and
instructive
was
expected
*NL*
from
so
renowned
a
chief
on
an
occasion
of
such
interest
.
Conscious
of
*NL*
the
wishes
of
the
people
,
the
stern
and
self-restrained
warrior
raised
*NL*
his
face
,
which
had
latterly
been
buried
in
his
robe
,
and
looked
about
*NL*
him
with
a
steady
eye
.
His
firmly
compressed
and
expressive
lips
then
*NL*
severed
,
and
for
the
first
time
during
the
long
ceremonies
his
voice
was
*NL*
distinctly
audible
.
``
Why
do
my
brothers
mourn
?
''
he
said
,
regarding
the
*NL*
dark
race
of
dejected
warriors
by
whom
he
was
environed
;
``
why
do
my
*NL*
daughters
weep
?
that
a
young
man
has
gone
to
the
happy
hunting-grounds
;
*NL*
that
a
chief
has
filled
his
time
with
honor
?
He
was
good
;
he
was
*NL*
dutiful
;
he
was
brave
.
Who
can
deny
it
?
The
Manitou
had
need
of
such
a
*NL*
warrior
,
and
He
has
called
him
away
.
As
for
me
,
the
son
and
the
father
*NL*
of
Uncas
,
I
am
a
blazed
pine
,
in
a
clearing
of
the
pale
faces
.
My
*NL*
race
has
gone
from
the
shores
of
the
salt
lake
and
the
hills
of
the
*NL*
Delawares
.
But
who
can
say
that
the
serpent
of
his
tribe
has
forgotten
*NL*
his
wisdom
?
I
am
alone

``
No
,
no
,
''
cried
Hawkeye
,
who
had
been
gazing
with
a
yearning
look
at
the
*NL*
rigid
features
of
his
friend
,
with
something
like
his
own
self-command
,
*NL*
but
whose
philosophy
could
endure
no
longer
;
``
no
,
Sagamore
,
not
alone
.
*NL*
The
gifts
of
our
colors
may
be
different
,
but
God
has
so
placed
us
as
to
*NL*
journey
in
the
same
path
.
I
have
no
kin
,
and
I
may
also
say
,
like
you
,
*NL*
no
people
.
He
was
your
son
,
and
a
red-skin
by
nature
;
and
it
may
be
that
*NL*
your
blood
was
nearer
--
but
,
if
ever
I
forget
the
lad
who
has
so
often
*NL*
fou
'
t
at
my
side
in
war
,
and
slept
at
my
side
in
peace
,
may
He
who
made
*NL*
us
all
,
whatever
may
be
our
color
or
our
gifts
,
forget
me
!
The
boy
has
*NL*
left
us
for
a
time
;
but
,
Sagamore
,
you
are
not
alone
.

*NL*
Chingachgook
grasped
the
hand
that
,
in
the
warmth
of
feeling
,
the
scout
*NL*
had
stretched
across
the
fresh
earth
,
and
in
an
attitude
of
friendship
*NL*
these
two
sturdy
and
intrepid
woodsmen
bowed
their
heads
together
,
while
*NL*
scalding
tears
fell
to
their
feet
,
watering
the
grave
of
Uncas
like
*NL*
drops
of
falling
rain
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
midst
of
the
awful
stillness
with
which
such
a
burst
of
feeling
,
*NL*
coming
as
it
did
,
from
the
two
most
renowned
warriors
of
that
region
,
*NL*
was
received
,
Tamenund
lifted
his
voice
to
disperse
the
multitude
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
enough
,
''
he
said
.
``
Go
,
children
of
the
Lenape
,
the
anger
of
*NL*
the
Manitou
is
not
done
.
Why
should
Tamenund
stay
?
The
pale
faces
are
*NL*
masters
of
the
earth
,
and
the
time
of
the
red
men
has
not
yet
come
*NL*
again
.
My
day
has
been
too
long
.
In
the
morning
I
saw
the
sons
of
Unamis
*NL*
happy
and
strong
;
and
yet
,
before
the
night
has
come
,
have
I
lived
to
*NL*
see
the
last
warrior
of
the
wise
race
of
the
Mohicans
.
