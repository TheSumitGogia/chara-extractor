THE
AUTHOR
'S
PREFACE
*NL*
*NL*
The
world
is
so
taken
up
of
late
with
novels
and
romances
,
that
it
will
*NL*
be
hard
for
a
private
history
to
be
taken
for
genuine
,
where
the
names
*NL*
and
other
circumstances
of
the
person
are
concealed
,
and
on
this
*NL*
account
we
must
be
content
to
leave
the
reader
to
pass
his
own
opinion
*NL*
upon
the
ensuing
sheet
,
and
take
it
just
as
he
pleases
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
author
is
here
supposed
to
be
writing
her
own
history
,
and
in
the
*NL*
very
beginning
of
her
account
she
gives
the
reasons
why
she
thinks
fit
*NL*
to
conceal
her
true
name
,
after
which
there
is
no
occasion
to
say
any
*NL*
more
about
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
true
that
the
original
of
this
story
is
put
into
new
words
,
and
*NL*
the
style
of
the
famous
lady
we
here
speak
of
is
a
little
altered
;
*NL*
particularly
she
is
made
to
tell
her
own
tale
in
modester
words
that
*NL*
she
told
it
at
first
,
the
copy
which
came
first
to
hand
having
been
*NL*
written
in
language
more
like
one
still
in
Newgate
than
one
grown
*NL*
penitent
and
humble
,
as
she
afterwards
pretends
to
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
pen
employed
in
finishing
her
story
,
and
making
it
what
you
now
see
*NL*
it
to
be
,
has
had
no
little
difficulty
to
put
it
into
a
dress
fit
to
be
*NL*
seen
,
and
to
make
it
speak
language
fit
to
be
read
.
When
a
woman
*NL*
debauched
from
her
youth
,
nay
,
even
being
the
offspring
of
debauchery
*NL*
and
vice
,
comes
to
give
an
account
of
all
her
vicious
practices
,
and
*NL*
even
to
descend
to
the
particular
occasions
and
circumstances
by
which
*NL*
she
ran
through
in
threescore
years
,
an
author
must
be
hard
put
to
it
*NL*
wrap
it
up
so
clean
as
not
to
give
room
,
especially
for
vicious
*NL*
readers
,
to
turn
it
to
his
disadvantage
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
possible
care
,
however
,
has
been
taken
to
give
no
lewd
ideas
,
no
*NL*
immodest
turns
in
the
new
dressing
up
of
this
story
;
no
,
not
to
the
*NL*
worst
parts
of
her
expressions
.
To
this
purpose
some
of
the
vicious
*NL*
part
of
her
life
,
which
could
not
be
modestly
told
,
is
quite
left
out
,
*NL*
and
several
other
parts
are
very
much
shortened
.
What
is
left
't
is
*NL*
hoped
will
not
offend
the
chastest
reader
or
the
modest
hearer
;
and
as
*NL*
the
best
use
is
made
even
of
the
worst
story
,
the
moral
't
is
hoped
will
*NL*
keep
the
reader
serious
,
even
where
the
story
might
incline
him
to
be
*NL*
otherwise
.
To
give
the
history
of
a
wicked
life
repented
of
,
*NL*
necessarily
requires
that
the
wicked
part
should
be
make
as
wicked
as
*NL*
the
real
history
of
it
will
bear
,
to
illustrate
and
give
a
beauty
to
*NL*
the
penitent
part
,
which
is
certainly
the
best
and
brightest
,
if
*NL*
related
with
equal
spirit
and
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
suggested
there
can
not
be
the
same
life
,
the
same
brightness
and
*NL*
beauty
,
in
relating
the
penitent
part
as
is
in
the
criminal
part
.
If
*NL*
there
is
any
truth
in
that
suggestion
,
I
must
be
allowed
to
say
't
is
*NL*
because
there
is
not
the
same
taste
and
relish
in
the
reading
,
and
*NL*
indeed
it
is
to
true
that
the
difference
lies
not
in
the
real
worth
of
*NL*
the
subject
so
much
as
in
the
gust
and
palate
of
the
reader
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
as
this
work
is
chiefly
recommended
to
those
who
know
how
to
read
*NL*
it
,
and
how
to
make
the
good
uses
of
it
which
the
story
all
along
*NL*
recommends
to
them
,
so
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
such
readers
will
be
more
*NL*
leased
with
the
moral
than
the
fable
,
with
the
application
than
with
*NL*
the
relation
,
and
with
the
end
of
the
writer
than
with
the
life
of
the
*NL*
person
written
of
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
in
this
story
abundance
of
delightful
incidents
,
and
all
of
*NL*
them
usefully
applied
.
There
is
an
agreeable
turn
artfully
given
them
*NL*
in
the
relating
,
that
naturally
instructs
the
reader
,
either
one
way
or
*NL*
other
.
The
first
part
of
her
lewd
life
with
the
young
gentleman
at
*NL*
Colchester
has
so
many
happy
turns
given
it
to
expose
the
crime
,
and
*NL*
warn
all
whose
circumstances
are
adapted
to
it
,
of
the
ruinous
end
of
*NL*
such
things
,
and
the
foolish
,
thoughtless
,
and
abhorred
conduct
of
both
*NL*
the
parties
,
that
it
abundantly
atones
for
all
the
lively
description
*NL*
she
gives
of
her
folly
and
wickedness
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
repentance
of
her
lover
at
the
Bath
,
and
how
brought
by
the
just
*NL*
alarm
of
his
fit
of
sickness
to
abandon
her
;
the
just
caution
given
*NL*
there
against
even
the
lawful
intimacies
of
the
dearest
friends
,
and
*NL*
how
unable
they
are
to
preserve
the
most
solemn
resolutions
of
virtue
*NL*
without
divine
assistance
;
these
are
parts
which
,
to
a
just
*NL*
discernment
,
will
appear
to
have
more
real
beauty
in
them
all
the
*NL*
amorous
chain
of
story
which
introduces
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
word
,
as
the
whole
relation
is
carefully
garbled
of
all
the
levity
*NL*
and
looseness
that
was
in
it
,
so
it
all
applied
,
and
with
the
utmost
*NL*
care
,
to
virtuous
and
religious
uses
.
None
can
,
without
being
guilty
*NL*
of
manifest
injustice
,
cast
any
reproach
upon
it
,
or
upon
our
design
in
*NL*
publishing
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
advocates
for
the
stage
have
,
in
all
ages
,
made
this
the
great
*NL*
argument
to
persuade
people
that
their
plays
are
useful
,
and
that
they
*NL*
ought
to
be
allowed
in
the
most
civilised
and
in
the
most
religious
*NL*
government
;
namely
,
that
they
are
applied
to
virtuous
purposes
,
and
*NL*
that
by
the
most
lively
representations
,
they
fail
not
to
recommend
*NL*
virtue
and
generous
principles
,
and
to
discourage
and
expose
all
sorts
*NL*
of
vice
and
corruption
of
manners
;
and
were
it
true
that
they
did
so
,
*NL*
and
that
they
constantly
adhered
to
that
rule
,
as
the
test
of
their
*NL*
acting
on
the
theatre
,
much
might
be
said
in
their
favour
.
*NL*
*NL*
Throughout
the
infinite
variety
of
this
book
,
this
fundamental
is
most
*NL*
strictly
adhered
to
;
there
is
not
a
wicked
action
in
any
part
of
it
,
*NL*
but
is
first
and
last
rendered
unhappy
and
unfortunate
;
there
is
not
a
*NL*
superlative
villain
brought
upon
the
stage
,
but
either
he
is
brought
to
*NL*
an
unhappy
end
,
or
brought
to
be
a
penitent
;
there
is
not
an
ill
thing
*NL*
mentioned
but
it
is
condemned
,
even
in
the
relation
,
nor
a
virtuous
,
*NL*
just
thing
but
it
carries
its
praise
along
with
it
.
What
can
more
*NL*
exactly
answer
the
rule
laid
down
,
to
recommend
even
those
*NL*
representations
of
things
which
have
so
many
other
just
objections
*NL*
leaving
against
them
?
namely
,
of
example
,
of
bad
company
,
obscene
*NL*
language
,
and
the
like
.
*NL*
*NL*
Upon
this
foundation
this
book
is
recommended
to
the
reader
as
a
work
*NL*
from
every
part
of
which
something
may
be
learned
,
and
some
just
and
*NL*
religious
inference
is
drawn
,
by
which
the
reader
will
have
something
*NL*
of
instruction
,
if
he
pleases
to
make
use
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
exploits
of
this
lady
of
fame
,
in
her
depredations
upon
*NL*
mankind
,
stand
as
so
many
warnings
to
honest
people
to
beware
of
them
,
*NL*
intimating
to
them
by
what
methods
innocent
people
are
drawn
in
,
*NL*
plundered
and
robbed
,
and
by
consequence
how
to
avoid
them
.
Her
*NL*
robbing
a
little
innocent
child
,
dressed
fine
by
the
vanity
of
the
*NL*
mother
,
to
go
to
the
dancing-school
,
is
a
good
memento
to
such
people
*NL*
hereafter
,
as
is
likewise
her
picking
the
gold
watch
from
the
young
*NL*
lady
's
side
in
the
Park
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
getting
a
parcel
from
a
hare-brained
wench
at
the
coaches
in
St.
*NL*
John
Street
;
her
booty
made
at
the
fire
,
and
again
at
Harwich
,
all
give
*NL*
us
excellent
warnings
in
such
cases
to
be
more
present
to
ourselves
in
*NL*
sudden
surprises
of
every
sort
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
application
to
a
sober
life
and
industrious
management
at
last
in
*NL*
Virginia
,
with
her
transported
spouse
,
is
a
story
fruitful
of
*NL*
instruction
to
all
the
unfortunate
creatures
who
are
obliged
to
seek
*NL*
their
re-establishment
abroad
,
whether
by
the
misery
of
transportation
*NL*
or
other
disaster
;
letting
them
know
that
diligence
and
application
*NL*
have
their
due
encouragement
,
even
in
the
remotest
parts
of
the
world
,
*NL*
and
that
no
case
can
be
so
low
,
so
despicable
,
or
so
empty
of
prospect
,
*NL*
but
that
an
unwearied
industry
will
go
a
great
way
to
deliver
us
from
*NL*
it
,
will
in
time
raise
the
meanest
creature
to
appear
again
the
world
,
*NL*
and
give
him
a
new
case
for
his
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
are
a
few
of
the
serious
inferences
which
we
are
led
by
the
hand
*NL*
to
in
this
book
,
and
these
are
fully
sufficient
to
justify
any
man
in
*NL*
recommending
it
to
the
world
,
and
much
more
to
justify
the
publication
*NL*
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
are
two
of
the
most
beautiful
parts
still
behind
,
which
this
*NL*
story
gives
some
idea
of
,
and
lets
us
into
the
parts
of
them
,
but
they
*NL*
are
either
of
them
too
long
to
be
brought
into
the
same
volume
,
and
*NL*
indeed
are
,
as
I
may
call
them
,
whole
volumes
of
themselves
,
viz.
:
1
.
*NL*
The
life
of
her
governess
,
as
she
calls
her
,
who
had
run
through
,
it
*NL*
seems
,
in
a
few
years
,
all
the
eminent
degrees
of
a
gentlewoman
,
a
*NL*
whore
,
and
a
bawd
;
a
midwife
and
a
midwife-keeper
,
as
they
are
called
;
*NL*
a
pawnbroker
,
a
childtaker
,
a
receiver
of
thieves
,
and
of
thieves
'
*NL*
purchase
,
that
is
to
say
,
of
stolen
goods
;
and
in
a
word
,
herself
a
*NL*
thief
,
a
breeder
up
of
thieves
and
the
like
,
and
yet
at
last
a
penitent
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
second
is
the
life
of
her
transported
husband
,
a
highwayman
,
who
it
*NL*
seems
,
lived
a
twelve
years
'
life
of
successful
villainy
upon
the
road
,
*NL*
and
even
at
last
came
off
so
well
as
to
be
a
volunteer
transport
,
not
a
*NL*
convict
;
and
in
whose
life
there
is
an
incredible
variety
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
as
I
have
said
,
these
are
things
too
long
to
bring
in
here
,
so
*NL*
neither
can
I
make
a
promise
of
the
coming
out
by
themselves
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
can
not
say
,
indeed
,
that
this
history
is
carried
on
quite
to
the
end
*NL*
of
the
life
of
this
famous
Moll
Flanders
,
as
she
calls
herself
,
for
*NL*
nobody
can
write
their
own
life
to
the
full
end
of
it
,
unless
they
can
*NL*
write
it
after
they
are
dead
.
But
her
husband
's
life
,
being
written
by
*NL*
a
third
hand
,
gives
a
full
account
of
them
both
,
how
long
they
lived
*NL*
together
in
that
country
,
and
how
they
both
came
to
England
again
,
*NL*
after
about
eight
years
,
in
which
time
they
were
grown
very
rich
,
and
*NL*
where
she
lived
,
it
seems
,
to
be
very
old
,
but
was
not
so
extraordinary
*NL*
a
penitent
as
she
was
at
first
;
it
seems
only
that
indeed
she
always
*NL*
spoke
with
abhorrence
of
her
former
life
,
and
of
every
part
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
her
last
scene
,
at
Maryland
and
Virginia
,
many
pleasant
things
*NL*
happened
,
which
makes
that
part
of
her
life
very
agreeable
,
but
they
*NL*
are
not
told
with
the
same
elegancy
as
those
accounted
for
by
herself
;
*NL*
so
it
is
still
to
the
more
advantage
that
we
break
off
here
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
MOLL
FLANDERS
*NL*
*NL*
My
true
name
is
so
well
known
in
the
records
or
registers
at
Newgate
,
*NL*
and
in
the
Old
Bailey
,
and
there
are
some
things
of
such
consequence
*NL*
still
depending
there
,
relating
to
my
particular
conduct
,
that
it
is
*NL*
not
be
expected
I
should
set
my
name
or
the
account
of
my
family
to
*NL*
this
work
;
perhaps
,
after
my
death
,
it
may
be
better
known
;
at
present
*NL*
it
would
not
be
proper
,
no
not
though
a
general
pardon
should
be
*NL*
issued
,
even
without
exceptions
and
reserve
of
persons
or
crimes
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
enough
to
tell
you
,
that
as
some
of
my
worst
comrades
,
who
are
*NL*
out
of
the
way
of
doing
me
harm
-LRB-
having
gone
out
of
the
world
by
the
*NL*
steps
and
the
string
,
as
I
often
expected
to
go
-RRB-
,
knew
me
by
the
name
*NL*
of
Moll
Flanders
,
so
you
may
give
me
leave
to
speak
of
myself
under
*NL*
that
name
till
I
dare
own
who
I
have
been
,
as
well
as
who
I
am
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
been
told
that
in
one
of
neighbour
nations
,
whether
it
be
in
*NL*
France
or
where
else
I
know
not
,
they
have
an
order
from
the
king
,
that
*NL*
when
any
criminal
is
condemned
,
either
to
die
,
or
to
the
galleys
,
or
to
*NL*
be
transported
,
if
they
leave
any
children
,
as
such
are
generally
*NL*
unprovided
for
,
by
the
poverty
or
forfeiture
of
their
parents
,
so
they
*NL*
are
immediately
taken
into
the
care
of
the
Government
,
and
put
into
a
*NL*
hospital
called
the
House
of
Orphans
,
where
they
are
bred
up
,
clothed
,
*NL*
fed
,
taught
,
and
when
fit
to
go
out
,
are
placed
out
to
trades
or
to
*NL*
services
,
so
as
to
be
well
able
to
provide
for
themselves
by
an
honest
,
*NL*
industrious
behaviour
.
*NL*
*NL*
Had
this
been
the
custom
in
our
country
,
I
had
not
been
left
a
poor
*NL*
desolate
girl
without
friends
,
without
clothes
,
without
help
or
helper
*NL*
in
the
world
,
as
was
my
fate
;
and
by
which
I
was
not
only
exposed
to
*NL*
very
great
distresses
,
even
before
I
was
capable
either
of
*NL*
understanding
my
case
or
how
to
amend
it
,
but
brought
into
a
course
of
*NL*
life
which
was
not
only
scandalous
in
itself
,
but
which
in
its
ordinary
*NL*
course
tended
to
the
swift
destruction
both
of
soul
and
body
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
case
was
otherwise
here
.
My
mother
was
convicted
of
felony
for
*NL*
a
certain
petty
theft
scarce
worth
naming
,
viz
.
having
an
opportunity
*NL*
of
borrowing
three
pieces
of
fine
holland
of
a
certain
draper
in
*NL*
Cheapside
.
The
circumstances
are
too
long
to
repeat
,
and
I
have
heard
*NL*
them
related
so
many
ways
,
that
I
can
scarce
be
certain
which
is
the
*NL*
right
account
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
it
was
,
this
they
all
agree
in
,
that
my
mother
pleaded
her
*NL*
belly
,
and
being
found
quick
with
child
,
she
was
respited
for
about
*NL*
seven
months
;
in
which
time
having
brought
me
into
the
world
,
and
being
*NL*
about
again
,
she
was
called
down
,
as
they
term
it
,
to
her
former
*NL*
judgment
,
but
obtained
the
favour
of
being
transported
to
the
*NL*
plantations
,
and
left
me
about
half
a
year
old
;
and
in
bad
hands
,
you
*NL*
may
be
sure
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
is
too
near
the
first
hours
of
my
life
for
me
to
relate
anything
*NL*
of
myself
but
by
hearsay
;
it
is
enough
to
mention
,
that
as
I
was
born
*NL*
in
such
an
unhappy
place
,
I
had
no
parish
to
have
recourse
to
for
my
*NL*
nourishment
in
my
infancy
;
nor
can
I
give
the
least
account
how
I
was
*NL*
kept
alive
,
other
than
that
,
as
I
have
been
told
,
some
relation
of
my
*NL*
mother
's
took
me
away
for
a
while
as
a
nurse
,
but
at
whose
expense
,
or
*NL*
by
whose
direction
,
I
know
nothing
at
all
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
account
that
I
can
recollect
,
or
could
ever
learn
of
myself
,
*NL*
was
that
I
had
wandered
among
a
crew
of
those
people
they
call
gypsies
,
*NL*
or
Egyptians
;
but
I
believe
it
was
but
a
very
little
while
that
I
had
*NL*
been
among
them
,
for
I
had
not
had
my
skin
discoloured
or
blackened
,
as
*NL*
they
do
very
young
to
all
the
children
they
carry
about
with
them
;
nor
*NL*
can
I
tell
how
I
came
among
them
,
or
how
I
got
from
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
at
Colchester
,
in
Essex
,
that
those
people
left
me
;
and
I
have
a
*NL*
notion
in
my
head
that
I
left
them
there
-LRB-
that
is
,
that
I
hid
myself
*NL*
and
would
not
go
any
farther
with
them
-RRB-
,
but
I
am
not
able
to
be
*NL*
particular
in
that
account
;
only
this
I
remember
,
that
being
taken
up
*NL*
by
some
of
the
parish
officers
of
Colchester
,
I
gave
an
account
that
I
*NL*
came
into
the
town
with
the
gypsies
,
but
that
I
would
not
go
any
*NL*
farther
with
them
,
and
that
so
they
had
left
me
,
but
whither
they
were
*NL*
gone
that
I
knew
not
,
nor
could
they
expect
it
of
me
;
for
though
they
*NL*
send
round
the
country
to
inquire
after
them
,
it
seems
they
could
not
*NL*
be
found
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
now
in
a
way
to
be
provided
for
;
for
though
I
was
not
a
parish
*NL*
charge
upon
this
or
that
part
of
the
town
by
law
,
yet
as
my
case
came
*NL*
to
be
known
,
and
that
I
was
too
young
to
do
any
work
,
being
not
above
*NL*
three
years
old
,
compassion
moved
the
magistrates
of
the
town
to
order
*NL*
some
care
to
be
taken
of
me
,
and
I
became
one
of
their
own
as
much
as
*NL*
if
I
had
been
born
in
the
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
provision
they
made
for
me
,
it
was
my
good
hap
to
be
put
to
*NL*
nurse
,
as
they
call
it
,
to
a
woman
who
was
indeed
poor
but
had
been
in
*NL*
better
circumstances
,
and
who
got
a
little
livelihood
by
taking
such
as
*NL*
I
was
supposed
to
be
,
and
keeping
them
with
all
necessaries
,
till
they
*NL*
were
at
a
certain
age
,
in
which
it
might
be
supposed
they
might
go
to
*NL*
service
or
get
their
own
bread
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
woman
had
also
had
a
little
school
,
which
she
kept
to
teach
*NL*
children
to
read
and
to
work
;
and
having
,
as
I
have
said
,
lived
before
*NL*
that
in
good
fashion
,
she
bred
up
the
children
she
took
with
a
great
*NL*
deal
of
art
,
as
well
as
with
a
great
deal
of
care
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
that
which
was
worth
all
the
rest
,
she
bred
them
up
very
*NL*
religiously
,
being
herself
a
very
sober
,
pious
woman
,
very
house-wifely
*NL*
and
clean
,
and
very
mannerly
,
and
with
good
behaviour
.
So
that
in
a
*NL*
word
,
expecting
a
plain
diet
,
coarse
lodging
,
and
mean
clothes
,
we
were
*NL*
brought
up
as
mannerly
and
as
genteelly
as
if
we
had
been
at
the
*NL*
dancing-school
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
continued
here
till
I
was
eight
years
old
,
when
I
was
terrified
*NL*
with
news
that
the
magistrates
-LRB-
as
I
think
they
called
them
-RRB-
had
*NL*
ordered
that
I
should
go
to
service
.
I
was
able
to
do
but
very
little
*NL*
service
wherever
I
was
to
go
,
except
it
was
to
run
of
errands
and
be
a
*NL*
drudge
to
some
cookmaid
,
and
this
they
told
me
of
often
,
which
put
me
*NL*
into
a
great
fright
;
for
I
had
a
thorough
aversion
to
going
to
service
,
*NL*
as
they
called
it
-LRB-
that
is
,
to
be
a
servant
-RRB-
,
though
I
was
so
young
;
*NL*
and
I
told
my
nurse
,
as
we
called
her
,
that
I
believed
I
could
get
my
*NL*
living
without
going
to
service
,
if
she
pleased
to
let
me
;
for
she
had
*NL*
taught
me
to
work
with
my
needle
,
and
spin
worsted
,
which
is
the
chief
*NL*
trade
of
that
city
,
and
I
told
her
that
if
she
would
keep
me
,
I
would
*NL*
work
for
her
,
and
I
would
work
very
hard
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
talked
to
her
almost
every
day
of
working
hard
;
and
,
in
short
,
I
did
*NL*
nothing
but
work
and
cry
all
day
,
which
grieved
the
good
,
kind
woman
so
*NL*
much
,
that
at
last
she
began
to
be
concerned
for
me
,
for
she
loved
me
*NL*
very
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
after
this
,
as
she
came
into
the
room
where
all
we
poor
*NL*
children
were
at
work
,
she
sat
down
just
over
against
me
,
not
in
her
*NL*
usual
place
as
mistress
,
but
as
if
she
set
herself
on
purpose
to
*NL*
observe
me
and
see
me
work
.
I
was
doing
something
she
had
set
me
to
;
*NL*
as
I
remember
,
it
was
marking
some
shirts
which
she
had
taken
to
make
,
*NL*
and
after
a
while
she
began
to
talk
to
me
.
`
Thou
foolish
child
,
'
says
*NL*
she
,
`
thou
art
always
crying
-LRB-
for
I
was
crying
then
-RRB-
;
`
prithee
,
what
*NL*
dost
cry
for
?
'
`
Because
they
will
take
me
away
,
'
says
I
,
`
and
put
me
to
*NL*
service
,
and
I
ca
n't
work
housework
.
'
`
Well
,
child
,
'
says
she
,
`
but
*NL*
though
you
ca
n't
work
housework
,
as
you
call
it
,
you
will
learn
it
in
*NL*
time
,
and
they
wo
n't
put
you
to
hard
things
at
first
.
'
`
Yes
,
they
*NL*
will
,
'
says
I
,
`
and
if
I
ca
n't
do
it
they
will
beat
me
,
and
the
maids
*NL*
will
beat
me
to
make
me
do
great
work
,
and
I
am
but
a
little
girl
and
I
*NL*
ca
n't
do
it
'
;
and
then
I
cried
again
,
till
I
could
not
speak
any
more
*NL*
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
moved
my
good
motherly
nurse
,
so
that
she
from
that
time
resolved
*NL*
I
should
not
go
to
service
yet
;
so
she
bid
me
not
cry
,
and
she
would
*NL*
speak
to
Mr.
Mayor
,
and
I
should
not
go
to
service
till
I
was
bigger
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
this
did
not
satisfy
me
,
for
to
think
of
going
to
service
was
*NL*
such
a
frightful
thing
to
me
,
that
if
she
had
assured
me
I
should
not
*NL*
have
gone
till
I
was
twenty
years
old
,
it
would
have
been
the
same
to
*NL*
me
;
I
should
have
cried
,
I
believe
,
all
the
time
,
with
the
very
*NL*
apprehension
of
its
being
to
be
so
at
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
saw
that
I
was
not
pacified
yet
,
she
began
to
be
angry
with
*NL*
me
.
`
And
what
would
you
have
?
'
says
she
;
`
do
n't
I
tell
you
that
you
*NL*
shall
not
go
to
service
till
your
are
bigger
?
'
`
Ay
,
'
said
I
,
`
but
then
*NL*
I
must
go
at
last
.
'
`
Why
,
what
?
'
said
she
;
`
is
the
girl
mad
?
What
*NL*
would
you
be
--
a
gentlewoman
?
'
`
Yes
,
'
says
I
,
and
cried
heartily
till
I
*NL*
roared
out
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
set
the
old
gentlewoman
a-laughing
at
me
,
as
you
may
be
sure
it
*NL*
would
.
`
Well
,
madam
,
forsooth
,
'
says
she
,
gibing
at
me
,
`
you
would
be
*NL*
a
gentlewoman
;
and
pray
how
will
you
come
to
be
a
gentlewoman
?
What
!
*NL*
will
you
do
it
by
your
fingers
'
end
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
'
says
I
again
,
very
innocently
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
what
can
you
earn
?
'
says
she
;
`
what
can
you
get
at
your
work
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Threepence
,
'
said
I
,
`
when
I
spin
,
and
fourpence
when
I
work
plain
*NL*
work
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Alas
!
poor
gentlewoman
,
'
said
she
again
,
laughing
,
`
what
will
that
do
*NL*
for
thee
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
will
keep
me
,
'
says
I
,
`
if
you
will
let
me
live
with
you
.
'
And
*NL*
this
I
said
in
such
a
poor
petitioning
tone
,
that
it
made
the
poor
*NL*
woman
's
heart
yearn
to
me
,
as
she
told
me
afterwards
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
,
'
says
she
,
`
that
will
not
keep
you
and
buy
you
clothes
too
;
and
*NL*
who
must
buy
the
little
gentlewoman
clothes
?
'
says
she
,
and
smiled
all
*NL*
the
while
at
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
will
work
harder
,
then
,
'
says
I
,
`
and
you
shall
have
it
all
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Poor
child
!
it
wo
n't
keep
you
,
'
says
she
;
`
it
will
hardly
keep
you
in
*NL*
victuals
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Then
I
will
have
no
victuals
,
'
says
I
,
again
very
innocently
;
`
let
me
*NL*
but
live
with
you
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
can
you
live
without
victuals
?
'
says
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
'
again
says
I
,
very
much
like
a
child
,
you
may
be
sure
,
and
still
*NL*
I
cried
heartily
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
no
policy
in
all
this
;
you
may
easily
see
it
was
all
nature
;
but
*NL*
it
was
joined
with
so
much
innocence
and
so
much
passion
that
,
in
*NL*
short
,
it
set
the
good
motherly
creature
a-weeping
too
,
and
she
cried
*NL*
at
last
as
fast
as
I
did
,
and
then
took
me
and
led
me
out
of
the
*NL*
teaching-room
.
`
Come
,
'
says
she
,
`
you
sha
n't
go
to
service
;
you
shall
*NL*
live
with
me
'
;
and
this
pacified
me
for
the
present
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
time
after
this
,
she
going
to
wait
on
the
Mayor
,
and
talking
of
*NL*
such
things
as
belonged
to
her
business
,
at
last
my
story
came
up
,
and
*NL*
my
good
nurse
told
Mr.
Mayor
the
whole
tale
.
He
was
so
pleased
with
*NL*
it
,
that
he
would
call
his
lady
and
his
two
daughters
to
hear
it
,
and
*NL*
it
made
mirth
enough
among
them
,
you
may
be
sure
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
not
a
week
had
passed
over
,
but
on
a
sudden
comes
Mrs.
*NL*
Mayoress
and
her
two
daughters
to
the
house
to
see
my
old
nurse
,
and
to
*NL*
see
her
school
and
the
children
.
When
they
had
looked
about
them
a
*NL*
little
,
`
Well
,
Mrs.
--
,
'
says
the
Mayoress
to
my
nurse
,
`
and
pray
*NL*
which
is
the
little
lass
that
intends
to
be
a
gentlewoman
?
'
I
heard
*NL*
her
,
and
I
was
terribly
frighted
at
first
,
though
I
did
not
know
why
*NL*
neither
;
but
Mrs.
Mayoress
comes
up
to
me
.
`
Well
,
miss
,
'
says
she
,
*NL*
`
and
what
are
you
at
work
upon
?
'
The
word
miss
was
a
language
that
had
*NL*
hardly
been
heard
of
in
our
school
,
and
I
wondered
what
sad
name
it
was
*NL*
she
called
me
.
However
,
I
stood
up
,
made
a
curtsy
,
and
she
took
my
*NL*
work
out
of
my
hand
,
looked
on
it
,
and
said
it
was
very
well
;
then
she
*NL*
took
up
one
of
the
hands
.
`
Nay
,
'
says
she
,
`
the
child
may
come
to
be
a
*NL*
gentlewoman
for
aught
anybody
knows
;
she
has
a
gentlewoman
's
hand
,
'
*NL*
says
she
.
This
pleased
me
mightily
,
you
may
be
sure
;
but
Mrs.
Mayoress
*NL*
did
not
stop
there
,
but
giving
me
my
work
again
,
she
put
her
hand
in
*NL*
her
pocket
,
gave
me
a
shilling
,
and
bid
me
mind
my
work
,
and
learn
to
*NL*
work
well
,
and
I
might
be
a
gentlewoman
for
aught
she
knew
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
all
this
while
my
good
old
nurse
,
Mrs.
Mayoress
,
and
all
the
rest
*NL*
of
them
did
not
understand
me
at
all
,
for
they
meant
one
sort
of
thing
*NL*
by
the
word
gentlewoman
,
and
I
meant
quite
another
;
for
alas
!
all
I
*NL*
understood
by
being
a
gentlewoman
was
to
be
able
to
work
for
myself
,
*NL*
and
get
enough
to
keep
me
without
that
terrible
bugbear
going
to
*NL*
service
,
whereas
they
meant
to
live
great
,
rich
and
high
,
and
I
know
*NL*
not
what
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
after
Mrs.
Mayoress
was
gone
,
her
two
daughters
came
in
,
and
they
*NL*
called
for
the
gentlewoman
too
,
and
they
talked
a
long
while
to
me
,
and
*NL*
I
answered
them
in
my
innocent
way
;
but
always
,
if
they
asked
me
*NL*
whether
I
resolved
to
be
a
gentlewoman
,
I
answered
Yes
.
At
last
one
of
*NL*
them
asked
me
what
a
gentlewoman
was
?
That
puzzled
me
much
;
but
,
*NL*
however
,
I
explained
myself
negatively
,
that
it
was
one
that
did
not
go
*NL*
to
service
,
to
do
housework
.
They
were
pleased
to
be
familiar
with
me
,
*NL*
and
like
my
little
prattle
to
them
,
which
,
it
seems
,
was
agreeable
*NL*
enough
to
them
,
and
they
gave
me
money
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
my
money
,
I
gave
it
all
to
my
mistress-nurse
,
as
I
called
her
,
*NL*
and
told
her
she
should
have
all
I
got
for
myself
when
I
was
a
*NL*
gentlewoman
,
as
well
as
now
.
By
this
and
some
other
of
my
talk
,
my
old
*NL*
tutoress
began
to
understand
me
about
what
I
meant
by
being
a
*NL*
gentlewoman
,
and
that
I
understood
by
it
no
more
than
to
be
able
to
get
*NL*
my
bread
by
my
own
work
;
and
at
last
she
asked
me
whether
it
was
not
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
told
her
,
yes
,
and
insisted
on
it
,
that
to
do
so
was
to
be
a
*NL*
gentlewoman
;
`
for
,
'
says
I
,
`
there
is
such
a
one
,
'
naming
a
woman
that
*NL*
mended
lace
and
washed
the
ladies
'
laced-heads
;
`
she
,
'
says
I
,
`
is
a
*NL*
gentlewoman
,
and
they
call
her
madam
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Poor
child
,
'
says
my
good
old
nurse
,
`
you
may
soon
be
such
a
*NL*
gentlewoman
as
that
,
for
she
is
a
person
of
ill
fame
,
and
has
had
two
*NL*
or
three
bastards
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
did
not
understand
anything
of
that
;
but
I
answered
,
'
I
am
sure
they
*NL*
call
her
madam
,
and
she
does
not
go
to
service
nor
do
housework
'
;
and
*NL*
therefore
I
insisted
that
she
was
a
gentlewoman
,
and
I
would
be
such
a
*NL*
gentlewoman
as
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
ladies
were
told
all
this
again
,
to
be
sure
,
and
they
made
*NL*
themselves
merry
with
it
,
and
every
now
and
then
the
young
ladies
,
Mr.
*NL*
Mayor
's
daughters
,
would
come
and
see
me
,
and
ask
where
the
little
*NL*
gentlewoman
was
,
which
made
me
not
a
little
proud
of
myself
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
held
a
great
while
,
and
I
was
often
visited
by
these
young
ladies
,
*NL*
and
sometimes
they
brought
others
with
them
;
so
that
I
was
known
by
it
*NL*
almost
all
over
the
town
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
now
about
ten
years
old
,
and
began
to
look
a
little
womanish
,
for
*NL*
I
was
mighty
grave
and
humble
,
very
mannerly
,
and
as
I
had
often
heard
*NL*
the
ladies
say
I
was
pretty
,
and
would
be
a
very
handsome
woman
,
so
you
*NL*
may
be
sure
that
hearing
them
say
so
made
me
not
a
little
proud
.
*NL*
However
,
that
pride
had
no
ill
effect
upon
me
yet
;
only
,
as
they
often
*NL*
gave
me
money
,
and
I
gave
it
to
my
old
nurse
,
she
,
honest
woman
,
was
so
*NL*
just
to
me
as
to
lay
it
all
out
again
for
me
,
and
gave
me
head-dresses
,
*NL*
and
linen
,
and
gloves
,
and
ribbons
,
and
I
went
very
neat
,
and
always
*NL*
clean
;
for
that
I
would
do
,
and
if
I
had
rags
on
,
I
would
always
be
*NL*
clean
,
or
else
I
would
dabble
them
in
water
myself
;
but
,
I
say
,
my
good
*NL*
nurse
,
when
I
had
money
given
me
,
very
honestly
laid
it
out
for
me
,
and
*NL*
would
always
tell
the
ladies
this
or
that
was
bought
with
their
money
;
*NL*
and
this
made
them
oftentimes
give
me
more
,
till
at
last
I
was
indeed
*NL*
called
upon
by
the
magistrates
,
as
I
understood
it
,
to
go
out
to
*NL*
service
;
but
then
I
was
come
to
be
so
good
a
workwoman
myself
,
and
the
*NL*
ladies
were
so
kind
to
me
,
that
it
was
plain
I
could
maintain
*NL*
myself
--
that
is
to
say
,
I
could
earn
as
much
for
my
nurse
as
she
was
*NL*
able
by
it
to
keep
me
--
so
she
told
them
that
if
they
would
give
her
*NL*
leave
,
she
would
keep
the
gentlewoman
,
as
she
called
me
,
to
be
her
*NL*
assistant
and
teach
the
children
,
which
I
was
very
well
able
to
do
;
for
*NL*
I
was
very
nimble
at
my
work
,
and
had
a
good
hand
with
my
needle
,
*NL*
though
I
was
yet
very
young
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
kindness
of
the
ladies
of
the
town
did
not
end
here
,
for
when
*NL*
they
came
to
understand
that
I
was
no
more
maintained
by
the
public
*NL*
allowance
as
before
,
they
gave
me
money
oftener
than
formerly
;
and
as
I
*NL*
grew
up
they
brought
me
work
to
do
for
them
,
such
as
linen
to
make
,
and
*NL*
laces
to
mend
,
and
heads
to
dress
up
,
and
not
only
paid
me
for
doing
*NL*
them
,
but
even
taught
me
how
to
do
them
;
so
that
now
I
was
a
*NL*
gentlewoman
indeed
,
as
I
understood
that
word
,
I
not
only
found
myself
*NL*
clothes
and
paid
my
nurse
for
my
keeping
,
but
got
money
in
my
pocket
*NL*
too
beforehand
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
ladies
also
gave
me
clothes
frequently
of
their
own
or
their
*NL*
children
's
;
some
stockings
,
some
petticoats
,
some
gowns
,
some
one
*NL*
thing
,
some
another
,
and
these
my
old
woman
managed
for
me
like
a
mere
*NL*
mother
,
and
kept
them
for
me
,
obliged
me
to
mend
them
,
and
turn
them
*NL*
and
twist
them
to
the
best
advantage
,
for
she
was
a
rare
housewife
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
one
of
the
ladies
took
so
much
fancy
to
me
that
she
would
have
*NL*
me
home
to
her
house
,
for
a
month
,
she
said
,
to
be
among
her
daughters
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
though
this
was
exceeding
kind
in
her
,
yet
,
as
my
old
good
woman
*NL*
said
to
her
,
unless
she
resolved
to
keep
me
for
good
and
all
,
she
would
*NL*
do
the
little
gentlewoman
more
harm
than
good
.
`
Well
,
'
says
the
lady
,
*NL*
`
that
's
true
;
and
therefore
I
'll
only
take
her
home
for
a
week
,
then
,
*NL*
that
I
may
see
how
my
daughters
and
she
agree
together
,
and
how
I
like
*NL*
her
temper
,
and
then
I
'll
tell
you
more
;
and
in
the
meantime
,
if
*NL*
anybody
comes
to
see
her
as
they
used
to
do
,
you
may
only
tell
them
you
*NL*
have
sent
her
out
to
my
house
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
prudently
managed
enough
,
and
I
went
to
the
lady
's
house
;
but
*NL*
I
was
so
pleased
there
with
the
young
ladies
,
and
they
so
pleased
with
*NL*
me
,
that
I
had
enough
to
do
to
come
away
,
and
they
were
as
unwilling
to
*NL*
part
with
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
I
did
come
away
,
and
lived
almost
a
year
more
with
my
honest
*NL*
old
woman
,
and
began
now
to
be
very
helpful
to
her
;
for
I
was
almost
*NL*
fourteen
years
old
,
was
tall
of
my
age
,
and
looked
a
little
womanish
;
*NL*
but
I
had
such
a
taste
of
genteel
living
at
the
lady
's
house
that
I
was
*NL*
not
so
easy
in
my
old
quarters
as
I
used
to
be
,
and
I
thought
it
was
*NL*
fine
to
be
a
gentlewoman
indeed
,
for
I
had
quite
other
notions
of
a
*NL*
gentlewoman
now
than
I
had
before
;
and
as
I
thought
,
I
say
,
that
it
was
*NL*
fine
to
be
a
gentlewoman
,
so
I
loved
to
be
among
gentlewomen
,
and
*NL*
therefore
I
longed
to
be
there
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
the
time
that
I
was
fourteen
years
and
a
quarter
old
,
my
good
*NL*
nurse
,
mother
I
rather
to
call
her
,
fell
sick
and
died
.
I
was
then
in
*NL*
a
sad
condition
indeed
,
for
as
there
is
no
great
bustle
in
putting
an
*NL*
end
to
a
poor
body
's
family
when
once
they
are
carried
to
the
grave
,
so
*NL*
the
poor
good
woman
being
buried
,
the
parish
children
she
kept
were
*NL*
immediately
removed
by
the
church-wardens
;
the
school
was
at
an
end
,
*NL*
and
the
children
of
it
had
no
more
to
do
but
just
stay
at
home
till
*NL*
they
were
sent
somewhere
else
;
and
as
for
what
she
left
,
her
daughter
,
*NL*
a
married
woman
with
six
or
seven
children
,
came
and
swept
it
all
away
*NL*
at
once
,
and
removing
the
goods
,
they
had
no
more
to
say
to
me
than
to
*NL*
jest
with
me
,
and
tell
me
that
the
little
gentlewoman
might
set
up
for
*NL*
herself
if
she
pleased
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
frighted
out
of
my
wits
almost
,
and
knew
not
what
to
do
,
for
I
*NL*
was
,
as
it
were
,
turned
out
of
doors
to
the
wide
world
,
and
that
which
*NL*
was
still
worse
,
the
old
honest
woman
had
two-and-twenty
shillings
of
*NL*
mine
in
her
hand
,
which
was
all
the
estate
the
little
gentlewoman
had
*NL*
in
the
world
;
and
when
I
asked
the
daughter
for
it
,
she
huffed
me
and
*NL*
laughed
at
me
,
and
told
me
she
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
true
the
good
,
poor
woman
had
told
her
daughter
of
it
,
and
that
*NL*
it
lay
in
such
a
place
,
that
it
was
the
child
's
money
,
and
had
called
*NL*
once
or
twice
for
me
to
give
it
me
,
but
I
was
,
unhappily
,
out
of
the
*NL*
way
somewhere
or
other
,
and
when
I
came
back
she
was
past
being
in
a
*NL*
condition
to
speak
of
it
.
However
,
the
daughter
was
so
honest
*NL*
afterwards
as
to
give
it
me
,
though
at
first
she
used
me
cruelly
about
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
was
I
a
poor
gentlewoman
indeed
,
and
I
was
just
that
very
night
to
*NL*
be
turned
into
the
wide
world
;
for
the
daughter
removed
all
the
goods
,
*NL*
and
I
had
not
so
much
as
a
lodging
to
go
to
,
or
a
bit
of
bread
to
eat
.
*NL*
But
it
seems
some
of
the
neighbours
,
who
had
known
my
circumstances
,
*NL*
took
so
much
compassion
of
me
as
to
acquaint
the
lady
in
whose
family
I
*NL*
had
been
a
week
,
as
I
mentioned
above
;
and
immediately
she
sent
her
*NL*
maid
to
fetch
me
away
,
and
two
of
her
daughters
came
with
the
maid
*NL*
though
unsent
.
So
I
went
with
them
,
bag
and
baggage
,
and
with
a
glad
*NL*
heart
,
you
may
be
sure
.
The
fright
of
my
condition
had
made
such
an
*NL*
impression
upon
me
,
that
I
did
not
want
now
to
be
a
gentlewoman
,
but
*NL*
was
very
willing
to
be
a
servant
,
and
that
any
kind
of
servant
they
*NL*
thought
fit
to
have
me
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
my
new
generous
mistress
,
for
she
exceeded
the
good
woman
I
was
*NL*
with
before
,
in
everything
,
as
well
as
in
the
matter
of
estate
;
I
say
,
*NL*
in
everything
except
honesty
;
and
for
that
,
though
this
was
a
lady
most
*NL*
exactly
just
,
yet
I
must
not
forget
to
say
on
all
occasions
,
that
the
*NL*
first
,
though
poor
,
was
as
uprightly
honest
as
it
was
possible
for
any
*NL*
one
to
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
no
sooner
carried
away
,
as
I
have
said
,
by
this
good
gentlewoman
,
*NL*
but
the
first
lady
,
that
is
to
say
,
the
Mayoress
that
was
,
sent
her
two
*NL*
daughters
to
take
care
of
me
;
and
another
family
which
had
taken
notice
*NL*
of
me
when
I
was
the
little
gentlewoman
,
and
had
given
me
work
to
do
,
*NL*
sent
for
me
after
her
,
so
that
I
was
mightily
made
of
,
as
we
say
;
nay
,
*NL*
and
they
were
not
a
little
angry
,
especially
madam
the
Mayoress
,
that
*NL*
her
friend
had
taken
me
away
from
her
,
as
she
called
it
;
for
,
as
she
*NL*
said
,
I
was
hers
by
right
,
she
having
been
the
first
that
took
any
*NL*
notice
of
me
.
But
they
that
had
me
would
not
part
with
me
;
and
as
for
*NL*
me
,
though
I
should
have
been
very
well
treated
with
any
of
the
others
,
*NL*
yet
I
could
not
be
better
than
where
I
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
I
continued
till
I
was
between
seventeen
and
eighteen
years
old
,
*NL*
and
here
I
had
all
the
advantages
for
my
education
that
could
be
*NL*
imagined
;
the
lady
had
masters
home
to
the
house
to
teach
her
daughters
*NL*
to
dance
,
and
to
speak
French
,
and
to
write
,
and
other
to
teach
them
*NL*
music
;
and
I
was
always
with
them
,
I
learned
as
fast
as
they
;
and
*NL*
though
the
masters
were
not
appointed
to
teach
me
,
yet
I
learned
by
*NL*
imitation
and
inquiry
all
that
they
learned
by
instruction
and
*NL*
direction
;
so
that
,
in
short
,
I
learned
to
dance
and
speak
French
as
*NL*
well
as
any
of
them
,
and
to
sing
much
better
,
for
I
had
a
better
voice
*NL*
than
any
of
them
.
I
could
not
so
readily
come
at
playing
on
the
*NL*
harpsichord
or
spinet
,
because
I
had
no
instrument
of
my
own
to
*NL*
practice
on
,
and
could
only
come
at
theirs
in
the
intervals
when
they
*NL*
left
it
,
which
was
uncertain
;
but
yet
I
learned
tolerably
well
too
,
and
*NL*
the
young
ladies
at
length
got
two
instruments
,
that
is
to
say
,
a
*NL*
harpsichord
and
a
spinet
too
,
and
then
they
taught
me
themselves
.
But
*NL*
as
to
dancing
,
they
could
hardly
help
my
learning
country-dances
,
*NL*
because
they
always
wanted
me
to
make
up
even
number
;
and
,
on
the
other
*NL*
hand
,
they
were
as
heartily
willing
to
learn
me
everything
that
they
*NL*
had
been
taught
themselves
,
as
I
could
be
to
take
the
learning
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
this
means
I
had
,
as
I
have
said
above
,
all
the
advantages
of
*NL*
education
that
I
could
have
had
if
I
had
been
as
much
a
gentlewoman
as
*NL*
they
were
with
whom
I
lived
;
and
in
some
things
I
had
the
advantage
of
*NL*
my
ladies
,
though
they
were
my
superiors
;
but
they
were
all
the
gifts
*NL*
of
nature
,
and
which
all
their
fortunes
could
not
furnish
.
First
,
I
*NL*
was
apparently
handsomer
than
any
of
them
;
secondly
,
I
was
better
*NL*
shaped
;
and
,
thirdly
,
I
sang
better
,
by
which
I
mean
I
had
a
better
*NL*
voice
;
in
all
which
you
will
,
I
hope
,
allow
me
to
say
,
I
do
not
speak
*NL*
my
own
conceit
of
myself
,
but
the
opinion
of
all
that
knew
the
family
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
with
all
these
the
common
vanity
of
my
sex
,
viz
.
that
being
*NL*
really
taken
for
very
handsome
,
or
,
if
you
please
,
for
a
great
beauty
,
*NL*
I
very
well
knew
it
,
and
had
as
good
an
opinion
of
myself
as
anybody
*NL*
else
could
have
of
me
;
and
particularly
I
loved
to
hear
anybody
speak
*NL*
of
it
,
which
could
not
but
happen
to
me
sometimes
,
and
was
a
great
*NL*
satisfaction
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
far
I
have
had
a
smooth
story
to
tell
of
myself
,
and
in
all
this
*NL*
part
of
my
life
I
not
only
had
the
reputation
of
living
in
a
very
good
*NL*
family
,
and
a
family
noted
and
respected
everywhere
for
virtue
and
*NL*
sobriety
,
and
for
every
valuable
thing
;
but
I
had
the
character
too
of
*NL*
a
very
sober
,
modest
,
and
virtuous
young
woman
,
and
such
I
had
always
*NL*
been
;
neither
had
I
yet
any
occasion
to
think
of
anything
else
,
or
to
*NL*
know
what
a
temptation
to
wickedness
meant
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
that
which
I
was
too
vain
of
was
my
ruin
,
or
rather
my
vanity
was
*NL*
the
cause
of
it
.
The
lady
in
the
house
where
I
was
had
two
sons
,
young
*NL*
gentlemen
of
very
promising
parts
and
of
extraordinary
behaviour
,
and
*NL*
it
was
my
misfortune
to
be
very
well
with
them
both
,
but
they
managed
*NL*
themselves
with
me
in
a
quite
different
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
eldest
,
a
gay
gentleman
that
knew
the
town
as
well
as
the
country
,
*NL*
and
though
he
had
levity
enough
to
do
an
ill-natured
thing
,
yet
had
too
*NL*
much
judgment
of
things
to
pay
too
dear
for
his
pleasures
;
he
began
*NL*
with
the
unhappy
snare
to
all
women
,
viz
.
taking
notice
upon
all
*NL*
occasions
how
pretty
I
was
,
as
he
called
it
,
how
agreeable
,
how
*NL*
well-carriaged
,
and
the
like
;
and
this
he
contrived
so
subtly
,
as
if
he
*NL*
had
known
as
well
how
to
catch
a
woman
in
his
net
as
a
partridge
when
*NL*
he
went
a-setting
;
for
he
would
contrive
to
be
talking
this
to
his
*NL*
sisters
when
,
though
I
was
not
by
,
yet
when
he
knew
I
was
not
far
off
*NL*
but
that
I
should
be
sure
to
hear
him
.
His
sisters
would
return
softly
*NL*
to
him
,
`
Hush
,
brother
,
she
will
hear
you
;
she
is
but
in
the
next
*NL*
room
.
'
Then
he
would
put
it
off
and
talk
softlier
,
as
if
he
had
not
*NL*
know
it
,
and
begin
to
acknowledge
he
was
wrong
;
and
then
,
as
if
he
had
*NL*
forgot
himself
,
he
would
speak
aloud
again
,
and
I
,
that
was
so
well
*NL*
pleased
to
hear
it
,
was
sure
to
listen
for
it
upon
all
occasions
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
he
had
thus
baited
his
hook
,
and
found
easily
enough
the
method
*NL*
how
to
lay
it
in
my
way
,
he
played
an
opener
game
;
and
one
day
,
going
*NL*
by
his
sister
's
chamber
when
I
was
there
,
doing
something
about
*NL*
dressing
her
,
he
comes
in
with
an
air
of
gaiety
.
`
Oh
,
Mrs.
Betty
,
'
*NL*
said
he
to
me
,
`
how
do
you
do
,
Mrs.
Betty
?
Do
n't
your
cheeks
burn
,
*NL*
Mrs.
Betty
?
'
I
made
a
curtsy
and
blushed
,
but
said
nothing
.
`
What
*NL*
makes
you
talk
so
,
brother
?
'
says
the
lady
.
`
Why
,
'
says
he
,
`
we
have
*NL*
been
talking
of
her
below-stairs
this
half-hour
.
'
`
Well
,
'
says
his
*NL*
sister
,
`
you
can
say
no
harm
of
her
,
that
I
am
sure
,
so
't
is
no
matter
*NL*
what
you
have
been
talking
about
.
'
`
Nay
,
'
says
he
,
''
tis
so
far
from
*NL*
talking
harm
of
her
,
that
we
have
been
talking
a
great
deal
of
good
,
*NL*
and
a
great
many
fine
things
have
been
said
of
Mrs.
Betty
,
I
assure
*NL*
you
;
and
particularly
,
that
she
is
the
handsomest
young
woman
in
*NL*
Colchester
;
and
,
in
short
,
they
begin
to
toast
her
health
in
the
town
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
wonder
at
you
,
brother
,
'
says
the
sister
.
`
Betty
wants
but
one
*NL*
thing
,
but
she
had
as
good
want
everything
,
for
the
market
is
against
*NL*
our
sex
just
now
;
and
if
a
young
woman
have
beauty
,
birth
,
breeding
,
*NL*
wit
,
sense
,
manners
,
modesty
,
and
all
these
to
an
extreme
,
yet
if
she
*NL*
have
not
money
,
she
's
nobody
,
she
had
as
good
want
them
all
for
nothing
*NL*
but
money
now
recommends
a
woman
;
the
men
play
the
game
all
into
their
*NL*
own
hands
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Her
younger
brother
,
who
was
by
,
cried
,
`
Hold
,
sister
,
you
run
too
*NL*
fast
;
I
am
an
exception
to
your
rule
.
I
assure
you
,
if
I
find
a
woman
*NL*
so
accomplished
as
you
talk
of
,
I
say
,
I
assure
you
,
I
would
not
*NL*
trouble
myself
about
the
money
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
,
'
says
the
sister
,
`
but
you
will
take
care
not
to
fancy
one
,
then
,
*NL*
without
the
money
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
do
n't
know
that
neither
,
'
says
the
brother
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
why
,
sister
,
'
says
the
elder
brother
,
`
why
do
you
exclaim
so
at
*NL*
the
men
for
aiming
so
much
at
the
fortune
?
You
are
none
of
them
that
*NL*
want
a
fortune
,
whatever
else
you
want
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
understand
you
,
brother
,
'
replies
the
lady
very
smartly
;
`
you
*NL*
suppose
I
have
the
money
,
and
want
the
beauty
;
but
as
times
go
now
,
the
*NL*
first
will
do
without
the
last
,
so
I
have
the
better
of
my
neighbours
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
'
says
the
younger
brother
,
`
but
your
neighbours
,
as
you
call
*NL*
them
,
may
be
even
with
you
,
for
beauty
will
steal
a
husband
sometimes
*NL*
in
spite
of
money
,
and
when
the
maid
chances
to
be
handsomer
than
the
*NL*
mistress
,
she
oftentimes
makes
as
good
a
market
,
and
rides
in
a
coach
*NL*
before
her
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
thought
it
was
time
for
me
to
withdraw
and
leave
them
,
and
I
did
so
,
*NL*
but
not
so
far
but
that
I
heard
all
their
discourse
,
in
which
I
heard
*NL*
abundance
of
the
fine
things
said
of
myself
,
which
served
to
prompt
my
*NL*
vanity
,
but
,
as
I
soon
found
,
was
not
the
way
to
increase
my
interest
*NL*
in
the
family
,
for
the
sister
and
the
younger
brother
fell
grievously
*NL*
out
about
it
;
and
as
he
said
some
very
disobliging
things
to
her
upon
*NL*
my
account
,
so
I
could
easily
see
that
she
resented
them
by
her
future
*NL*
conduct
to
me
,
which
indeed
was
very
unjust
to
me
,
for
I
had
never
had
*NL*
the
least
thought
of
what
she
suspected
as
to
her
younger
brother
;
*NL*
indeed
,
the
elder
brother
,
in
his
distant
,
remote
way
,
had
said
a
great
*NL*
many
things
as
in
jest
,
which
I
had
the
folly
to
believe
were
in
*NL*
earnest
,
or
to
flatter
myself
with
the
hopes
of
what
I
ought
to
have
*NL*
supposed
he
never
intended
,
and
perhaps
never
thought
of
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
happened
one
day
that
he
came
running
upstairs
,
towards
the
room
*NL*
where
his
sisters
used
to
sit
and
work
,
as
he
often
used
to
do
;
and
*NL*
calling
to
them
before
he
came
in
,
as
was
his
way
too
,
I
,
being
there
*NL*
alone
,
stepped
to
the
door
,
and
said
,
`
Sir
,
the
ladies
are
not
here
,
*NL*
they
are
walked
down
the
garden
.
'
As
I
stepped
forward
to
say
this
,
*NL*
towards
the
door
,
he
was
just
got
to
the
door
,
and
clasping
me
in
his
*NL*
arms
,
as
if
it
had
been
by
chance
,
`
Oh
,
Mrs.
Betty
,
'
says
he
,
`
are
you
*NL*
here
?
That
's
better
still
;
I
want
to
speak
with
you
more
than
I
do
*NL*
with
them
'
;
and
then
,
having
me
in
his
arms
,
he
kissed
me
three
or
four
*NL*
times
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
struggled
to
get
away
,
and
yet
did
it
but
faintly
neither
,
and
he
*NL*
held
me
fast
,
and
still
kissed
me
,
till
he
was
almost
out
of
breath
,
*NL*
and
then
,
sitting
down
,
says
,
`
Dear
Betty
,
I
am
in
love
with
you
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
His
words
,
I
must
confess
,
fired
my
blood
;
all
my
spirits
flew
about
my
*NL*
heart
and
put
me
into
disorder
enough
,
which
he
might
easily
have
seen
*NL*
in
my
face
.
He
repeated
it
afterwards
several
times
,
that
he
was
in
*NL*
love
with
me
,
and
my
heart
spoke
as
plain
as
a
voice
,
that
I
liked
it
;
*NL*
nay
,
whenever
he
said
,
'
I
am
in
love
with
you
,
'
my
blushes
plainly
*NL*
replied
,
`
Would
you
were
,
sir
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
nothing
else
passed
at
that
time
;
it
was
but
a
surprise
,
and
*NL*
when
he
was
gone
I
soon
recovered
myself
again
.
He
had
stayed
longer
*NL*
with
me
,
but
he
happened
to
look
out
at
the
window
and
see
his
sisters
*NL*
coming
up
the
garden
,
so
he
took
his
leave
,
kissed
me
again
,
told
me
he
*NL*
was
very
serious
,
and
I
should
hear
more
of
him
very
quickly
,
and
away
*NL*
he
went
,
leaving
me
infinitely
pleased
,
though
surprised
;
and
had
there
*NL*
not
been
one
misfortune
in
it
,
I
had
been
in
the
right
,
but
the
mistake
*NL*
lay
here
,
that
Mrs.
Betty
was
in
earnest
and
the
gentleman
was
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
this
time
my
head
ran
upon
strange
things
,
and
I
may
truly
say
I
*NL*
was
not
myself
;
to
have
such
a
gentleman
talk
to
me
of
being
in
love
*NL*
with
me
,
and
of
my
being
such
a
charming
creature
,
as
he
told
me
I
was
;
*NL*
these
were
things
I
knew
not
how
to
bear
,
my
vanity
was
elevated
to
the
*NL*
last
degree
.
It
is
true
I
had
my
head
full
of
pride
,
but
,
knowing
*NL*
nothing
of
the
wickedness
of
the
times
,
I
had
not
one
thought
of
my
own
*NL*
safety
or
of
my
virtue
about
me
;
and
had
my
young
master
offered
it
at
*NL*
first
sight
,
he
might
have
taken
any
liberty
he
thought
fit
with
me
;
*NL*
but
he
did
not
see
his
advantage
,
which
was
my
happiness
for
that
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
this
attack
it
was
not
long
but
he
found
an
opportunity
to
catch
*NL*
me
again
,
and
almost
in
the
same
posture
;
indeed
,
it
had
more
of
design
*NL*
in
it
on
his
part
,
though
not
on
my
part
.
It
was
thus
:
the
young
*NL*
ladies
were
all
gone
a-visiting
with
their
mother
;
his
brother
was
out
*NL*
of
town
;
and
as
for
his
father
,
he
had
been
in
London
for
a
week
*NL*
before
.
He
had
so
well
watched
me
that
he
knew
where
I
was
,
though
I
*NL*
did
not
so
much
as
know
that
he
was
in
the
house
;
and
he
briskly
comes
*NL*
up
the
stairs
and
,
seeing
me
at
work
,
comes
into
the
room
to
me
*NL*
directly
,
and
began
just
as
he
did
before
,
with
taking
me
in
his
arms
,
*NL*
and
kissing
me
for
almost
a
quarter
of
an
hour
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
his
younger
sister
's
chamber
that
I
was
in
,
and
as
there
was
*NL*
nobody
in
the
house
but
the
maids
below-stairs
,
he
was
,
it
may
be
,
the
*NL*
ruder
;
in
short
,
he
began
to
be
in
earnest
with
me
indeed
.
Perhaps
he
*NL*
found
me
a
little
too
easy
,
for
God
knows
I
made
no
resistance
to
him
*NL*
while
he
only
held
me
in
his
arms
and
kissed
me
;
indeed
,
I
was
too
well
*NL*
pleased
with
it
to
resist
him
much
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
as
it
were
,
tired
with
that
kind
of
work
,
we
sat
down
,
and
*NL*
there
he
talked
with
me
a
great
while
;
he
said
he
was
charmed
with
me
,
*NL*
and
that
he
could
not
rest
night
or
day
till
he
had
told
me
how
he
was
*NL*
in
love
with
me
,
and
,
if
I
was
able
to
love
him
again
,
and
would
make
*NL*
him
happy
,
I
should
be
the
saving
of
his
life
,
and
many
such
fine
*NL*
things
.
I
said
little
to
him
again
,
but
easily
discovered
that
I
was
a
*NL*
fool
,
and
that
I
did
not
in
the
least
perceive
what
he
meant
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
walked
about
the
room
,
and
taking
me
by
the
hand
,
I
walked
with
*NL*
him
;
and
by
and
by
,
taking
his
advantage
,
he
threw
me
down
upon
the
*NL*
bed
,
and
kissed
me
there
most
violently
;
but
,
to
give
him
his
due
,
*NL*
offered
no
manner
of
rudeness
to
me
,
only
kissed
a
great
while
.
After
*NL*
this
he
thought
he
had
heard
somebody
come
upstairs
,
so
got
off
from
*NL*
the
bed
,
lifted
me
up
,
professing
a
great
deal
of
love
for
me
,
but
told
*NL*
me
it
was
all
an
honest
affection
,
and
that
he
meant
no
ill
to
me
;
and
*NL*
with
that
he
put
five
guineas
into
my
hand
,
and
went
away
downstairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
more
confounded
with
the
money
than
I
was
before
with
the
love
,
*NL*
and
began
to
be
so
elevated
that
I
scarce
knew
the
ground
I
stood
on
.
*NL*
I
am
the
more
particular
in
this
part
,
that
if
my
story
comes
to
be
*NL*
read
by
any
innocent
young
body
,
they
may
learn
from
it
to
guard
*NL*
themselves
against
the
mischiefs
which
attend
an
early
knowledge
of
*NL*
their
own
beauty
.
If
a
young
woman
once
thinks
herself
handsome
,
she
*NL*
never
doubts
the
truth
of
any
man
that
tells
her
he
is
in
love
with
*NL*
her
;
for
if
she
believes
herself
charming
enough
to
captivate
him
,
't
is
*NL*
natural
to
expect
the
effects
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
young
gentleman
had
fired
his
inclination
as
much
as
he
had
my
*NL*
vanity
,
and
,
as
if
he
had
found
that
he
had
an
opportunity
and
was
*NL*
sorry
he
did
not
take
hold
of
it
,
he
comes
up
again
in
half
an
hour
or
*NL*
thereabouts
,
and
falls
to
work
with
me
again
as
before
,
only
with
a
*NL*
little
less
introduction
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
first
,
when
he
entered
the
room
,
he
turned
about
and
shut
the
door
.
*NL*
`
Mrs.
Betty
,
'
said
he
,
'
I
fancied
before
somebody
was
coming
upstairs
,
*NL*
but
it
was
not
so
;
however
,
'
adds
he
,
`
if
they
find
me
in
the
room
with
*NL*
you
,
they
sha
n't
catch
me
a-kissing
of
you
.
'
I
told
him
I
did
not
know
*NL*
who
should
be
coming
upstairs
,
for
I
believed
there
was
nobody
in
the
*NL*
house
but
the
cook
and
the
other
maid
,
and
they
never
came
up
those
*NL*
stairs
.
`
Well
,
my
dear
,
'
says
he
,
''
tis
good
to
be
sure
,
however
'
;
and
*NL*
so
he
sits
down
,
and
we
began
to
talk
.
And
now
,
though
I
was
still
all
*NL*
on
fire
with
his
first
visit
,
and
said
little
,
he
did
as
it
were
put
*NL*
words
in
my
mouth
,
telling
me
how
passionately
he
loved
me
,
and
that
*NL*
though
he
could
not
mention
such
a
thing
till
he
came
to
this
estate
,
*NL*
yet
he
was
resolved
to
make
me
happy
then
,
and
himself
too
;
that
is
to
*NL*
say
,
to
marry
me
,
and
abundance
of
such
fine
things
,
which
I
,
poor
*NL*
fool
,
did
not
understand
the
drift
of
,
but
acted
as
if
there
was
no
*NL*
such
thing
as
any
kind
of
love
but
that
which
tended
to
matrimony
;
and
*NL*
if
he
had
spoke
of
that
,
I
had
no
room
,
as
well
as
no
power
,
to
have
*NL*
said
no
;
but
we
were
not
come
that
length
yet
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
not
sat
long
,
but
he
got
up
,
and
,
stopping
my
very
breath
with
*NL*
kisses
,
threw
me
upon
the
bed
again
;
but
then
being
both
well
warmed
,
*NL*
he
went
farther
with
me
than
decency
permits
me
to
mention
,
nor
had
it
*NL*
been
in
my
power
to
have
denied
him
at
that
moment
,
had
he
offered
much
*NL*
more
than
he
did
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
though
he
took
these
freedoms
with
me
,
it
did
not
go
to
that
*NL*
which
they
call
the
last
favour
,
which
,
to
do
him
justice
,
he
did
not
*NL*
attempt
;
and
he
made
that
self-denial
of
his
a
plea
for
all
his
*NL*
freedoms
with
me
upon
other
occasions
after
this
.
When
this
was
over
,
*NL*
he
stayed
but
a
little
while
,
but
he
put
almost
a
handful
of
gold
in
my
*NL*
hand
,
and
left
me
,
making
a
thousand
protestations
of
his
passion
for
*NL*
me
,
and
of
his
loving
me
above
all
the
women
in
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
will
not
be
strange
if
I
now
began
to
think
,
but
alas
!
it
was
but
*NL*
with
very
little
solid
reflection
.
I
had
a
most
unbounded
stock
of
*NL*
vanity
and
pride
,
and
but
a
very
little
stock
of
virtue
.
I
did
indeed
*NL*
case
sometimes
with
myself
what
young
master
aimed
at
,
but
thought
of
*NL*
nothing
but
the
fine
words
and
the
gold
;
whether
he
intended
to
marry
*NL*
me
,
or
not
to
marry
me
,
seemed
a
matter
of
no
great
consequence
to
me
;
*NL*
nor
did
my
thoughts
so
much
as
suggest
to
me
the
necessity
of
making
*NL*
any
capitulation
for
myself
,
till
he
came
to
make
a
kind
of
formal
*NL*
proposal
to
me
,
as
you
shall
hear
presently
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
I
gave
up
myself
to
a
readiness
of
being
ruined
without
the
least
*NL*
concern
and
am
a
fair
memento
to
all
young
women
whose
vanity
prevails
*NL*
over
their
virtue
.
Nothing
was
ever
so
stupid
on
both
sides
.
Had
I
*NL*
acted
as
became
me
,
and
resisted
as
virtue
and
honour
require
,
this
*NL*
gentleman
had
either
desisted
his
attacks
,
finding
no
room
to
expect
*NL*
the
accomplishment
of
his
design
,
or
had
made
fair
and
honourable
*NL*
proposals
of
marriage
;
in
which
case
,
whoever
had
blamed
him
,
nobody
*NL*
could
have
blamed
me
.
In
short
,
if
he
had
known
me
,
and
how
easy
the
*NL*
trifle
he
aimed
at
was
to
be
had
,
he
would
have
troubled
his
head
no
*NL*
farther
,
but
have
given
me
four
or
five
guineas
,
and
have
lain
with
me
*NL*
the
next
time
he
had
come
at
me
.
And
if
I
had
known
his
thoughts
,
and
*NL*
how
hard
he
thought
I
would
be
to
be
gained
,
I
might
have
made
my
own
*NL*
terms
with
him
;
and
if
I
had
not
capitulated
for
an
immediate
marriage
,
*NL*
I
might
for
a
maintenance
till
marriage
,
and
might
have
had
what
I
*NL*
would
;
for
he
was
already
rich
to
excess
,
besides
what
he
had
in
*NL*
expectation
;
but
I
seemed
wholly
to
have
abandoned
all
such
thoughts
as
*NL*
these
,
and
was
taken
up
only
with
the
pride
of
my
beauty
,
and
of
being
*NL*
beloved
by
such
a
gentleman
.
As
for
the
gold
,
I
spent
whole
hours
in
*NL*
looking
upon
it
;
I
told
the
guineas
over
and
over
a
thousand
times
a
*NL*
day
.
Never
poor
vain
creature
was
so
wrapt
up
with
every
part
of
the
*NL*
story
as
I
was
,
not
considering
what
was
before
me
,
and
how
near
my
*NL*
ruin
was
at
the
door
;
indeed
,
I
think
I
rather
wished
for
that
ruin
*NL*
than
studied
to
avoid
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
,
however
,
I
was
cunning
enough
not
to
give
the
least
*NL*
room
to
any
in
the
family
to
suspect
me
,
or
to
imagine
that
I
had
the
*NL*
least
correspondence
with
this
young
gentleman
.
I
scarce
ever
looked
*NL*
towards
him
in
public
,
or
answered
if
he
spoke
to
me
when
anybody
was
*NL*
near
us
;
but
for
all
that
,
we
had
every
now
and
then
a
little
*NL*
encounter
,
where
we
had
room
for
a
word
or
two
,
an
now
and
then
a
kiss
,
*NL*
but
no
fair
opportunity
for
the
mischief
intended
;
and
especially
*NL*
considering
that
he
made
more
circumlocution
than
,
if
he
had
known
by
*NL*
thoughts
,
he
had
occasion
for
;
and
the
work
appearing
difficult
to
him
,
*NL*
he
really
made
it
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
as
the
devil
is
an
unwearied
tempter
,
so
he
never
fails
to
find
*NL*
opportunity
for
that
wickedness
he
invites
to
.
It
was
one
evening
that
*NL*
I
was
in
the
garden
,
with
his
two
younger
sisters
and
himself
,
and
all
*NL*
very
innocently
merry
,
when
he
found
means
to
convey
a
note
into
my
*NL*
hand
,
by
which
he
directed
me
to
understand
that
he
would
to-morrow
*NL*
desire
me
publicly
to
go
of
an
errand
for
him
into
the
town
,
and
that
I
*NL*
should
see
him
somewhere
by
the
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
Accordingly
,
after
dinner
,
he
very
gravely
says
to
me
,
his
sisters
*NL*
being
all
by
,
`
Mrs.
Betty
,
I
must
ask
a
favour
of
you
.
'
`
What
's
that
?
'
*NL*
says
his
second
sister
.
`
Nay
,
sister
,
'
says
he
very
gravely
,
`
if
you
*NL*
ca
n't
spare
Mrs.
Betty
to-day
,
any
other
time
will
do
.
'
Yes
,
they
*NL*
said
,
they
could
spare
her
well
enough
,
and
the
sister
begged
pardon
*NL*
for
asking
,
which
they
did
but
of
mere
course
,
without
any
meaning
.
*NL*
`
Well
,
but
,
brother
,
'
says
the
eldest
sister
,
`
you
must
tell
Mrs.
Betty
*NL*
what
it
is
;
if
it
be
any
private
business
that
we
must
not
hear
,
you
*NL*
may
call
her
out
.
There
she
is
.
'
`
Why
,
sister
,
'
says
the
gentleman
*NL*
very
gravely
,
`
what
do
you
mean
?
I
only
desire
her
to
go
into
the
High
*NL*
Street
'
-LRB-
and
then
he
pulls
out
a
turnover
-RRB-
,
`
to
such
a
shop
'
;
and
then
*NL*
he
tells
them
a
long
story
of
two
fine
neckcloths
he
had
bid
money
for
,
*NL*
and
he
wanted
to
have
me
go
and
make
an
errand
to
buy
a
neck
to
the
*NL*
turnover
that
he
showed
,
to
see
if
they
would
take
my
money
for
the
*NL*
neckcloths
;
to
bid
a
shilling
more
,
and
haggle
with
them
;
and
then
he
*NL*
made
more
errands
,
and
so
continued
to
have
such
petty
business
to
do
,
*NL*
that
I
should
be
sure
to
stay
a
good
while
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
had
given
me
my
errands
,
he
told
them
a
long
story
of
a
visit
*NL*
he
was
going
to
make
to
a
family
they
all
knew
,
and
where
was
to
be
*NL*
such-and-such
gentlemen
,
and
how
merry
they
were
to
be
,
and
very
*NL*
formally
asks
his
sisters
to
go
with
him
,
and
they
as
formally
excused
*NL*
themselves
,
because
of
company
that
they
had
notice
was
to
come
and
*NL*
visit
them
that
afternoon
;
which
,
by
the
way
,
he
had
contrived
on
*NL*
purpose
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
scarce
done
speaking
to
them
,
and
giving
me
my
errand
,
but
his
*NL*
man
came
up
to
tell
him
that
Sir
W
--
H
--
's
coach
stopped
at
the
*NL*
door
;
so
he
runs
down
,
and
comes
up
again
immediately
.
`
Alas
!
'
says
he
*NL*
aloud
,
`
there
's
all
my
mirth
spoiled
at
once
;
sir
W
--
has
sent
his
*NL*
coach
for
me
,
and
desires
to
speak
with
me
upon
some
earnest
business
.
'
*NL*
It
seems
this
Sir
W
--
was
a
gentleman
who
lived
about
three
miles
out
*NL*
of
town
,
to
whom
he
had
spoken
on
purpose
the
day
before
,
to
lend
him
*NL*
his
chariot
for
a
particular
occasion
,
and
had
appointed
it
to
call
for
*NL*
him
,
as
it
did
,
about
three
o'clock
.
*NL*
*NL*
Immediately
he
calls
for
his
best
wig
,
hat
,
and
sword
,
and
ordering
his
*NL*
man
to
go
to
the
other
place
to
make
his
excuse
--
that
was
to
say
,
he
*NL*
made
an
excuse
to
send
his
man
away
--
he
prepares
to
go
into
the
coach
.
*NL*
As
he
was
going
,
he
stopped
a
while
,
and
speaks
mighty
earnestly
to
me
*NL*
about
his
business
,
and
finds
an
opportunity
to
say
very
softly
to
me
,
*NL*
`
Come
away
,
my
dear
,
as
soon
as
ever
you
can
.
'
I
said
nothing
,
but
*NL*
made
a
curtsy
,
as
if
I
had
done
so
to
what
he
said
in
public
.
In
about
*NL*
a
quarter
of
an
hour
I
went
out
too
;
I
had
no
dress
other
than
before
,
*NL*
except
that
I
had
a
hood
,
a
mask
,
a
fan
,
and
a
pair
of
gloves
in
my
*NL*
pocket
;
so
that
there
was
not
the
least
suspicion
in
the
house
.
He
*NL*
waited
for
me
in
the
coach
in
a
back-lane
,
which
he
knew
I
must
pass
*NL*
by
,
and
had
directed
the
coachman
whither
to
go
,
which
was
to
a
certain
*NL*
place
,
called
Mile
End
,
where
lived
a
confidant
of
his
,
where
we
went
*NL*
in
,
and
where
was
all
the
convenience
in
the
world
to
be
as
wicked
as
*NL*
we
pleased
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
were
together
he
began
to
talk
very
gravely
to
me
,
and
to
tell
*NL*
me
he
did
not
bring
me
there
to
betray
me
;
that
his
passion
for
me
*NL*
would
not
suffer
him
to
abuse
me
;
that
he
resolved
to
marry
me
as
soon
*NL*
as
he
came
to
his
estate
;
that
in
the
meantime
,
if
I
would
grant
his
*NL*
request
,
he
would
maintain
me
very
honourably
;
and
made
me
a
thousand
*NL*
protestations
of
his
sincerity
and
of
his
affection
to
me
;
and
that
he
*NL*
would
never
abandon
me
,
and
as
I
may
say
,
made
a
thousand
more
*NL*
preambles
than
he
need
to
have
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
as
he
pressed
me
to
speak
,
I
told
him
I
had
no
reason
to
*NL*
question
the
sincerity
of
his
love
to
me
after
so
many
protestations
,
*NL*
but
--
and
there
I
stopped
,
as
if
I
left
him
to
guess
the
rest
.
`
But
*NL*
what
,
my
dear
?
'
says
he
.
'
I
guess
what
you
mean
:
what
if
you
should
*NL*
be
with
child
?
Is
not
that
it
?
Why
,
then
,
'
says
he
,
`
I
'll
take
care
*NL*
of
you
and
provide
for
you
,
and
the
child
too
;
and
that
you
may
see
I
*NL*
am
not
in
jest
,
'
says
he
,
`
here
's
an
earnest
for
you
,
'
and
with
that
he
*NL*
pulls
out
a
silk
purse
,
with
an
hundred
guineas
in
it
,
and
gave
it
me
.
*NL*
`
And
I
'll
give
you
such
another
,
'
says
he
,
`
every
year
till
I
marry
*NL*
you
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
My
colour
came
and
went
,
at
the
sight
of
the
purse
and
with
the
fire
of
*NL*
his
proposal
together
,
so
that
I
could
not
say
a
word
,
and
he
easily
*NL*
perceived
it
;
so
putting
the
purse
into
my
bosom
,
I
made
no
more
*NL*
resistance
to
him
,
but
let
him
do
just
what
he
pleased
,
and
as
often
as
*NL*
he
pleased
;
and
thus
I
finished
my
own
destruction
at
once
,
for
from
*NL*
this
day
,
being
forsaken
of
my
virtue
and
my
modesty
,
I
had
nothing
of
*NL*
value
left
to
recommend
me
,
either
to
God
's
blessing
or
man
's
*NL*
assistance
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
things
did
not
end
here
.
I
went
back
to
the
town
,
did
the
business
*NL*
he
publicly
directed
me
to
,
and
was
at
home
before
anybody
thought
me
*NL*
long
.
As
for
my
gentleman
,
he
stayed
out
,
as
he
told
me
he
would
,
till
*NL*
late
at
night
,
and
there
was
not
the
least
suspicion
in
the
family
*NL*
either
on
his
account
or
on
mine
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
,
after
this
,
frequent
opportunities
to
repeat
our
crime
*NL*
--
chiefly
by
his
contrivance
--
especially
at
home
,
when
his
mother
and
*NL*
the
young
ladies
went
abroad
a-visiting
,
which
he
watched
so
narrowly
*NL*
as
never
to
miss
;
knowing
always
beforehand
when
they
went
out
,
and
*NL*
then
failed
not
to
catch
me
all
alone
,
and
securely
enough
;
so
that
we
*NL*
took
our
fill
of
our
wicked
pleasure
for
near
half
a
year
;
and
yet
,
*NL*
which
was
the
most
to
my
satisfaction
,
I
was
not
with
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
before
this
half-year
was
expired
,
his
younger
brother
,
of
whom
I
*NL*
have
made
some
mention
in
the
beginning
of
the
story
,
falls
to
work
*NL*
with
me
;
and
he
,
finding
me
alone
in
the
garden
one
evening
,
begins
a
*NL*
story
of
the
same
kind
to
me
,
made
good
honest
professions
of
being
in
*NL*
love
with
me
,
and
in
short
,
proposes
fairly
and
honourably
to
marry
me
,
*NL*
and
that
before
he
made
any
other
offer
to
me
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
now
confounded
,
and
driven
to
such
an
extremity
as
the
like
was
*NL*
never
known
;
at
least
not
to
me
.
I
resisted
the
proposal
with
*NL*
obstinacy
;
and
now
I
began
to
arm
myself
with
arguments
.
I
laid
before
*NL*
him
the
inequality
of
the
match
;
the
treatment
I
should
meet
with
in
*NL*
the
family
;
the
ingratitude
it
would
be
to
his
good
father
and
mother
,
*NL*
who
had
taken
me
into
their
house
upon
such
generous
principles
,
and
*NL*
when
I
was
in
such
a
low
condition
;
and
,
in
short
,
I
said
everything
to
*NL*
dissuade
him
from
his
design
that
I
could
imagine
,
except
telling
him
*NL*
the
truth
,
which
would
indeed
have
put
an
end
to
it
all
,
but
that
I
*NL*
durst
not
think
of
mentioning
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
here
happened
a
circumstance
that
I
did
not
expect
indeed
,
which
*NL*
put
me
to
my
shifts
;
for
this
young
gentleman
,
as
he
was
plain
and
*NL*
honest
,
so
he
pretended
to
nothing
with
me
but
what
was
so
too
;
and
,
*NL*
knowing
his
own
innocence
,
he
was
not
so
careful
to
make
his
having
a
*NL*
kindness
for
Mrs.
Betty
a
secret
I
the
house
,
as
his
brother
was
.
And
*NL*
though
he
did
not
let
them
know
that
he
had
talked
to
me
about
it
,
yet
*NL*
he
said
enough
to
let
his
sisters
perceive
he
loved
me
,
and
his
mother
*NL*
saw
it
too
,
which
,
though
they
took
no
notice
of
it
to
me
,
yet
they
did
*NL*
to
him
,
an
immediately
I
found
their
carriage
to
me
altered
,
more
than
*NL*
ever
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
saw
the
cloud
,
though
I
did
not
foresee
the
storm
.
It
was
easy
,
I
*NL*
say
,
to
see
that
their
carriage
to
me
was
altered
,
and
that
it
grew
*NL*
worse
and
worse
every
day
;
till
at
last
I
got
information
among
the
*NL*
servants
that
I
should
,
in
a
very
little
while
,
be
desired
to
remove
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
not
alarmed
at
the
news
,
having
a
full
satisfaction
that
I
should
*NL*
be
otherwise
provided
for
;
and
especially
considering
that
I
had
reason
*NL*
every
day
to
expect
I
should
be
with
child
,
and
that
then
I
should
be
*NL*
obliged
to
remove
without
any
pretences
for
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
some
time
the
younger
gentleman
took
an
opportunity
to
tell
me
*NL*
that
the
kindness
he
had
for
me
had
got
vent
in
the
family
.
He
did
not
*NL*
charge
me
with
it
,
he
said
,
for
he
know
well
enough
which
way
it
came
*NL*
out
.
He
told
me
his
plain
way
of
talking
had
been
the
occasion
of
it
,
*NL*
for
that
he
did
not
make
his
respect
for
me
so
much
a
secret
as
he
*NL*
might
have
done
,
and
the
reason
was
,
that
he
was
at
a
point
,
that
if
I
*NL*
would
consent
to
have
him
,
he
would
tell
them
all
openly
that
he
loved
*NL*
me
,
and
that
he
intended
to
marry
me
;
that
it
was
true
his
father
and
*NL*
mother
might
resent
it
,
and
be
unkind
,
but
that
he
was
now
in
a
way
to
*NL*
live
,
being
bred
to
the
law
,
and
he
did
not
fear
maintaining
me
*NL*
agreeable
to
what
I
should
expect
;
and
that
,
in
short
,
as
he
believed
I
*NL*
would
not
be
ashamed
of
him
,
so
he
was
resolved
not
to
be
ashamed
of
*NL*
me
,
and
that
he
scorned
to
be
afraid
to
own
me
now
,
whom
he
resolved
to
*NL*
own
after
I
was
his
wife
,
and
therefore
I
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
give
*NL*
him
my
hand
,
and
he
would
answer
for
all
the
rest
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
now
in
a
dreadful
condition
indeed
,
and
now
I
repented
heartily
*NL*
my
easiness
with
the
eldest
brother
;
not
from
any
reflection
of
*NL*
conscience
,
but
from
a
view
of
the
happiness
I
might
have
enjoyed
,
and
*NL*
had
now
made
impossible
;
for
though
I
had
no
great
scruples
of
*NL*
conscience
,
as
I
have
said
,
to
struggle
with
,
yet
I
could
not
think
of
*NL*
being
a
whore
to
one
brother
and
a
wife
to
the
other
.
But
then
it
came
*NL*
into
my
thoughts
that
the
first
brother
had
promised
to
made
me
his
*NL*
wife
when
he
came
to
his
estate
;
but
I
presently
remembered
what
I
had
*NL*
often
thought
of
,
that
he
had
never
spoken
a
word
of
having
me
for
a
*NL*
wife
after
he
had
conquered
me
for
a
mistress
;
and
indeed
,
till
now
,
*NL*
though
I
said
I
thought
of
it
often
,
yet
it
gave
me
no
disturbance
at
*NL*
all
,
for
as
he
did
not
seem
in
the
least
to
lessen
his
affection
to
me
,
*NL*
so
neither
did
he
lessen
his
bounty
,
though
he
had
the
discretion
*NL*
himself
to
desire
me
not
to
lay
out
a
penny
of
what
he
gave
me
in
*NL*
clothes
,
or
to
make
the
least
show
extraordinary
,
because
it
would
*NL*
necessarily
give
jealousy
in
the
family
,
since
everybody
know
I
could
*NL*
come
at
such
things
no
manner
of
ordinary
way
,
but
by
some
private
*NL*
friendship
,
which
they
would
presently
have
suspected
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
was
now
in
a
great
strait
,
and
knew
not
what
to
do
.
The
main
*NL*
difficulty
was
this
:
the
younger
brother
not
only
laid
close
siege
to
*NL*
me
,
but
suffered
it
to
be
seen
.
He
would
come
into
his
sister
's
room
,
*NL*
and
his
mother
's
room
,
and
sit
down
,
and
talk
a
thousand
kind
things
of
*NL*
me
,
and
to
me
,
even
before
their
faces
,
and
when
they
were
all
there
.
*NL*
This
grew
so
public
that
the
whole
house
talked
of
it
,
and
his
mother
*NL*
reproved
him
for
it
,
and
their
carriage
to
me
appeared
quite
altered
.
*NL*
In
short
,
his
mother
had
let
fall
some
speeches
,
as
if
she
intended
to
*NL*
put
me
out
of
the
family
;
that
is
,
in
English
,
to
turn
me
out
of
doors
.
*NL*
Now
I
was
sure
this
could
not
be
a
secret
to
his
brother
,
only
that
he
*NL*
might
not
think
,
as
indeed
nobody
else
yet
did
,
that
the
youngest
*NL*
brother
had
made
any
proposal
to
me
about
it
;
but
as
I
easily
could
see
*NL*
that
it
would
go
farther
,
so
I
saw
likewise
there
was
an
absolute
*NL*
necessity
to
speak
of
it
to
him
,
or
that
he
would
speak
of
it
to
me
,
*NL*
and
which
to
do
first
I
knew
not
;
that
is
,
whether
I
should
break
it
to
*NL*
him
or
let
it
alone
till
he
should
break
it
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
Upon
serious
consideration
,
for
indeed
now
I
began
to
consider
things
*NL*
very
seriously
,
and
never
till
now
;
I
say
,
upon
serious
consideration
,
*NL*
I
resolved
to
tell
him
of
it
first
;
and
it
was
not
long
before
I
had
an
*NL*
opportunity
,
for
the
very
next
day
his
brother
went
to
London
upon
some
*NL*
business
,
and
the
family
being
out
a-visiting
,
just
as
it
had
happened
*NL*
before
,
and
as
indeed
was
often
the
case
,
he
came
according
to
his
*NL*
custom
,
to
spend
an
hour
or
two
with
Mrs.
Betty
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
came
had
had
sat
down
a
while
,
he
easily
perceived
there
was
an
*NL*
alteration
in
my
countenance
,
that
I
was
not
so
free
and
pleasant
with
*NL*
him
as
I
used
to
be
,
and
particularly
,
that
I
had
been
a-crying
;
he
was
*NL*
not
long
before
he
took
notice
of
it
,
and
asked
me
in
very
kind
terms
*NL*
what
was
the
matter
,
and
if
anything
troubled
me
.
I
would
have
put
it
*NL*
off
if
I
could
,
but
it
was
not
to
be
concealed
;
so
after
suffering
many
*NL*
importunities
to
draw
that
out
of
me
which
I
longed
as
much
as
possible
*NL*
to
disclose
,
I
told
him
that
it
was
true
something
did
trouble
me
,
and
*NL*
something
of
such
a
nature
that
I
could
not
conceal
from
him
,
and
yet
*NL*
that
I
could
not
tell
how
to
tell
him
of
it
neither
;
that
it
was
a
*NL*
thing
that
not
only
surprised
me
,
but
greatly
perplexed
me
,
and
that
I
*NL*
knew
not
what
course
to
take
,
unless
he
would
direct
me
.
He
told
me
*NL*
with
great
tenderness
,
that
let
it
be
what
it
would
,
I
should
not
let
*NL*
it
trouble
me
,
for
he
would
protect
me
from
all
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
then
began
at
a
distance
,
and
told
him
I
was
afraid
the
ladies
had
*NL*
got
some
secret
information
of
our
correspondence
;
for
that
it
was
easy
*NL*
to
see
that
their
conduct
was
very
much
changed
towards
me
for
a
great
*NL*
while
,
and
that
now
it
was
come
to
that
pass
that
they
frequently
found
*NL*
fault
with
me
,
and
sometimes
fell
quite
out
with
me
,
though
I
never
*NL*
gave
them
the
least
occasion
;
that
whereas
I
used
always
to
lie
with
*NL*
the
eldest
sister
,
I
was
lately
put
to
lie
by
myself
,
or
with
one
of
*NL*
the
maids
;
and
that
I
had
overheard
them
several
times
talking
very
*NL*
unkindly
about
me
;
but
that
which
confirmed
it
all
was
,
that
one
of
the
*NL*
servants
had
told
me
that
she
had
heard
I
was
to
be
turned
out
,
and
*NL*
that
it
was
not
safe
for
the
family
that
I
should
be
any
longer
in
the
*NL*
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
smiled
when
he
herd
all
this
,
and
I
asked
him
how
he
could
make
so
*NL*
light
of
it
,
when
he
must
needs
know
that
if
there
was
any
discovery
I
*NL*
was
undone
for
ever
,
and
that
even
it
would
hurt
him
,
though
not
ruin
*NL*
him
as
it
would
me
.
I
upbraided
him
,
that
he
was
like
all
the
rest
of
*NL*
the
sex
,
that
,
when
they
had
the
character
and
honour
of
a
woman
at
*NL*
their
mercy
,
oftentimes
made
it
their
jest
,
and
at
least
looked
upon
it
*NL*
as
a
trifle
,
and
counted
the
ruin
of
those
they
had
had
their
will
of
*NL*
as
a
thing
of
no
value
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
saw
me
warm
and
serious
,
and
he
changed
his
style
immediately
;
he
*NL*
told
me
he
was
sorry
I
should
have
such
a
thought
of
him
;
that
he
had
*NL*
never
given
me
the
least
occasion
for
it
,
but
had
been
as
tender
of
my
*NL*
reputation
as
he
could
be
of
his
own
;
that
he
was
sure
our
*NL*
correspondence
had
been
managed
with
so
much
address
,
that
not
one
*NL*
creature
in
the
family
had
so
much
as
a
suspicion
of
it
;
that
if
he
*NL*
smiled
when
I
told
him
my
thoughts
,
it
was
at
the
assurance
he
lately
*NL*
received
,
that
our
understanding
one
another
was
not
so
much
as
known
*NL*
or
guessed
at
;
and
that
when
he
had
told
me
how
much
reason
he
had
to
*NL*
be
easy
,
I
should
smile
as
he
did
,
for
he
was
very
certain
it
would
*NL*
give
me
a
full
satisfaction
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
This
is
a
mystery
I
can
not
understand
,
'
says
I
,
`
or
how
it
should
be
*NL*
to
my
satisfaction
that
I
am
to
be
turned
out
of
doors
;
for
if
our
*NL*
correspondence
is
not
discovered
,
I
know
not
what
else
I
have
done
to
*NL*
change
the
countenances
of
the
whole
family
to
me
,
or
to
have
them
*NL*
treat
me
as
they
do
now
,
who
formerly
used
me
with
so
much
tenderness
,
*NL*
as
if
I
had
been
one
of
their
own
children
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
look
you
,
child
,
'
says
he
,
`
that
they
are
uneasy
about
you
,
that
*NL*
is
true
;
but
that
they
have
the
least
suspicion
of
the
case
as
it
is
,
*NL*
and
as
it
respects
you
and
I
,
is
so
far
from
being
true
,
that
they
*NL*
suspect
my
brother
Robin
;
and
,
in
short
,
they
are
fully
persuaded
he
*NL*
makes
love
to
you
;
nay
,
the
fool
has
put
it
into
their
heads
too
*NL*
himself
,
for
he
is
continually
bantering
them
about
it
,
and
making
a
*NL*
jest
of
himself
.
I
confess
I
think
he
is
wrong
to
do
so
,
because
he
*NL*
can
not
but
see
it
vexes
them
,
and
makes
them
unkind
to
you
;
but
't
is
a
*NL*
satisfaction
to
me
,
because
of
the
assurance
it
gives
me
,
that
they
do
*NL*
not
suspect
me
in
the
least
,
and
I
hope
this
will
be
to
your
*NL*
satisfaction
too
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
So
it
is
,
'
says
I
,
`
one
way
;
but
this
does
not
reach
my
case
at
all
,
*NL*
nor
is
this
the
chief
thing
that
troubles
me
,
though
I
have
been
*NL*
concerned
about
that
too
.
'
`
What
is
it
,
then
?
'
says
he
.
With
which
I
*NL*
fell
to
tears
,
and
could
say
nothing
to
him
at
all
.
He
strove
to
*NL*
pacify
me
all
he
could
,
but
began
at
last
to
be
very
pressing
upon
me
*NL*
to
tell
what
it
was
.
At
last
I
answered
that
I
thought
I
ought
to
tell
*NL*
him
too
,
and
that
he
had
some
right
to
know
it
;
besides
,
that
I
wanted
*NL*
his
direction
in
the
case
,
for
I
was
in
such
perplexity
that
I
knew
not
*NL*
what
course
to
take
,
and
then
I
related
the
whole
affair
to
him
.
I
*NL*
told
him
how
imprudently
his
brother
had
managed
himself
,
in
making
*NL*
himself
so
public
;
for
that
if
he
had
kept
it
a
secret
,
as
such
a
thing
*NL*
out
to
have
been
,
I
could
but
have
denied
him
positively
,
without
*NL*
giving
any
reason
for
it
,
and
he
would
in
time
have
ceased
his
*NL*
solicitations
;
but
that
he
had
the
vanity
,
first
,
to
depend
upon
it
*NL*
that
I
would
not
deny
him
,
and
then
had
taken
the
freedom
to
tell
his
*NL*
resolution
of
having
me
to
the
whole
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
told
him
how
far
I
had
resisted
him
,
and
told
him
how
sincere
and
*NL*
honourable
his
offers
were
.
`
But
,
'
says
I
,
`
my
case
will
be
doubly
*NL*
hard
;
for
as
they
carry
it
ill
to
me
now
,
because
he
desires
to
have
*NL*
me
,
they
'll
carry
it
worse
when
they
shall
find
I
have
denied
him
;
and
*NL*
they
will
presently
say
,
there
's
something
else
in
it
,
and
then
out
it
*NL*
comes
that
I
am
married
already
to
somebody
else
,
or
that
I
would
never
*NL*
refuse
a
match
so
much
above
me
as
this
was
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
This
discourse
surprised
him
indeed
very
much
.
He
told
me
that
it
was
*NL*
a
critical
point
indeed
for
me
to
manage
,
and
he
did
not
see
which
way
*NL*
I
should
get
out
of
it
;
but
he
would
consider
it
,
and
let
me
know
next
*NL*
time
we
met
,
what
resolution
he
was
come
to
about
it
;
and
in
the
*NL*
meantime
desired
I
would
not
give
my
consent
to
his
brother
,
nor
yet
*NL*
give
him
a
flat
denial
,
but
that
I
would
hold
him
in
suspense
a
while
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
seemed
to
start
at
his
saying
I
should
not
give
him
my
consent
.
I
*NL*
told
him
he
knew
very
well
I
had
no
consent
to
give
;
that
he
had
*NL*
engaged
himself
to
marry
me
,
and
that
my
consent
was
the
same
time
*NL*
engaged
to
him
;
that
he
had
all
along
told
me
I
was
his
wife
,
and
I
*NL*
looked
upon
myself
as
effectually
so
as
if
the
ceremony
had
passed
;
and
*NL*
that
it
was
from
his
own
mouth
that
I
did
so
,
he
having
all
along
*NL*
persuaded
me
to
call
myself
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
my
dear
,
'
says
he
,
`
do
n't
be
concerned
at
that
now
;
if
I
am
not
*NL*
your
husband
,
I
'll
be
as
good
as
a
husband
to
you
;
and
do
not
let
those
*NL*
things
trouble
you
now
,
but
let
me
look
a
little
farther
into
this
*NL*
affair
,
and
I
shall
be
able
to
say
more
next
time
we
meet
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
pacified
me
as
well
as
he
could
with
this
,
but
I
found
he
was
very
*NL*
thoughtful
,
and
that
though
he
was
very
kind
to
me
and
kissed
me
a
*NL*
thousand
times
,
and
more
I
believe
,
and
gave
me
money
too
,
yet
he
*NL*
offered
no
more
all
the
while
we
were
together
,
which
was
above
two
*NL*
hours
,
and
which
I
much
wondered
at
indeed
at
that
time
,
considering
*NL*
how
it
used
to
be
,
and
what
opportunity
we
had
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
brother
did
not
come
from
London
for
five
or
six
days
,
and
it
was
*NL*
two
days
more
before
he
got
an
opportunity
to
talk
with
him
;
but
then
*NL*
getting
him
by
himself
he
began
to
talk
very
close
to
him
about
it
,
and
*NL*
the
same
evening
got
an
opportunity
-LRB-
for
we
had
a
long
conference
*NL*
together
-RRB-
to
repeat
all
their
discourse
to
me
,
which
,
as
near
as
I
can
*NL*
remember
,
was
to
the
purpose
following
.
He
told
him
he
heard
strange
*NL*
news
of
him
since
he
went
,
viz
.
that
he
made
love
to
Mrs.
Betty
.
*NL*
`
Well
,
says
his
brother
a
little
angrily
,
`
and
so
I
do
.
And
what
then
?
*NL*
What
has
anybody
to
do
with
that
?
'
`
Nay
,
'
says
his
brother
,
`
do
n't
be
*NL*
angry
,
Robin
;
I
do
n't
pretend
to
have
anything
to
do
with
it
;
nor
do
I
*NL*
pretend
to
be
angry
with
you
about
it
.
But
I
find
they
do
concern
*NL*
themselves
about
it
,
and
that
they
have
used
the
poor
girl
ill
about
*NL*
it
,
which
I
should
take
as
done
to
myself
.
'
`
Whom
do
you
mean
by
*NL*
THEY
?
'
says
Robin
.
'
I
mean
my
mother
and
the
girls
,
'
says
the
elder
*NL*
brother
.
`
But
hark
ye
,
'
says
his
brother
,
`
are
you
in
earnest
?
Do
you
*NL*
really
love
this
girl
?
You
may
be
free
with
me
,
you
know
.
'
`
Why
,
*NL*
then
,
'
says
Robin
,
'
I
will
be
free
with
you
;
I
do
love
her
above
all
*NL*
the
women
in
the
world
,
and
I
will
have
her
,
let
them
say
and
do
what
*NL*
they
will
.
I
believe
the
girl
will
not
deny
me
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
It
struck
me
to
the
heart
when
he
told
me
this
,
for
though
it
was
most
*NL*
rational
to
think
I
would
not
deny
him
,
yet
I
knew
in
my
own
conscience
*NL*
I
must
deny
him
,
and
I
saw
my
ruin
in
my
being
obliged
to
do
so
;
but
I
*NL*
knew
it
was
my
business
to
talk
otherwise
then
,
so
I
interrupted
him
in
*NL*
his
story
thus
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ay
!
'
said
I
,
`
does
he
think
I
can
not
deny
him
?
But
he
shall
find
I
*NL*
can
deny
him
,
for
all
that
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
my
dear
,
'
says
he
,
`
but
let
me
give
you
the
whole
story
as
it
*NL*
went
on
between
us
,
and
then
say
what
you
will
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
went
on
and
told
me
that
he
replied
thus
:
`
But
,
brother
,
you
*NL*
know
she
has
nothing
,
and
you
may
have
several
ladies
with
good
*NL*
fortunes
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
''
Tis
no
matter
for
that
,
'
said
Robin
;
'
I
love
the
girl
,
and
I
will
*NL*
never
please
my
pocket
in
marrying
,
and
not
please
my
fancy
.
'
`
And
so
,
*NL*
my
dear
,
'
adds
he
,
`
there
is
no
opposing
him
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
yes
,
'
says
I
,
`
you
shall
see
I
can
oppose
him
;
I
have
learnt
to
*NL*
say
No
,
now
though
I
had
not
learnt
it
before
;
if
the
best
lord
in
the
*NL*
land
offered
me
marriage
now
,
I
could
very
cheerfully
say
No
to
him
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
but
,
my
dear
,
'
says
he
,
`
what
can
you
say
to
him
?
You
know
,
as
*NL*
you
said
when
we
talked
of
it
before
,
he
well
ask
you
many
questions
*NL*
about
it
,
and
all
the
house
will
wonder
what
the
meaning
of
it
should
*NL*
be
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
'
says
I
,
smiling
,
'
I
can
stop
all
their
mouths
at
one
clap
by
*NL*
telling
him
,
and
them
too
,
that
I
am
married
already
to
his
elder
*NL*
brother
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
smiled
a
little
too
at
the
word
,
but
I
could
see
it
startled
him
,
*NL*
and
he
could
not
hide
the
disorder
it
put
him
into
.
However
,
he
*NL*
returned
,
`
Why
,
though
that
may
be
true
in
some
sense
,
yet
I
suppose
*NL*
you
are
but
in
jest
when
you
talk
of
giving
such
an
answer
as
that
;
it
*NL*
may
not
be
convenient
on
many
accounts
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
no
,
'
says
I
pleasantly
,
'
I
am
not
so
fond
of
letting
the
secret
*NL*
come
out
without
your
consent
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
what
,
then
,
can
you
say
to
him
,
or
to
them
,
'
says
he
,
`
when
they
*NL*
find
you
positive
against
a
match
which
would
be
apparently
so
much
to
*NL*
your
advantage
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
'
says
I
,
`
should
I
be
at
a
loss
?
First
of
all
,
I
am
not
obliged
*NL*
to
give
me
any
reason
at
all
;
on
the
other
hand
,
I
may
tell
them
I
am
*NL*
married
already
,
and
stop
there
,
and
that
will
be
a
full
stop
too
to
*NL*
him
,
for
he
can
have
no
reason
to
ask
one
question
after
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ay
,
'
says
he
;
`
but
the
whole
house
will
tease
you
about
that
,
even
to
*NL*
father
and
mother
,
and
if
you
deny
them
positively
,
they
will
be
*NL*
disobliged
at
you
,
and
suspicious
besides
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
'
says
I
,
`
what
can
I
do
?
What
would
have
me
do
?
I
was
in
*NL*
straight
enough
before
,
and
as
I
told
you
,
I
was
in
perplexity
before
,
*NL*
and
acquainted
you
with
the
circumstances
,
that
I
might
have
your
*NL*
advice
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
My
dear
,
'
says
he
,
'
I
have
been
considering
very
much
upon
it
,
you
may
*NL*
be
sure
,
and
though
it
is
a
piece
of
advice
that
has
a
great
many
*NL*
mortifications
in
it
to
me
,
and
may
at
first
seem
strange
to
you
,
yet
,
*NL*
all
things
considered
,
I
see
no
better
way
for
you
than
to
let
him
go
*NL*
on
;
and
if
you
find
him
hearty
and
in
earnest
,
marry
him
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
gave
him
a
look
full
of
horror
at
those
words
,
and
,
turning
pale
as
*NL*
death
,
was
at
the
very
point
of
sinking
down
out
of
the
chair
I
sat
in
;
*NL*
when
,
giving
a
start
,
`
My
dear
,
'
says
he
aloud
,
`
what
's
the
matter
with
*NL*
you
?
Where
are
you
a-going
?
'
and
a
great
many
such
things
;
and
with
*NL*
jogging
and
called
to
me
,
fetched
me
a
little
to
myself
,
though
it
was
*NL*
a
good
while
before
I
fully
recovered
my
senses
,
and
was
not
able
to
*NL*
speak
for
several
minutes
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
was
fully
recovered
he
began
again
.
`
My
dear
,
'
says
he
,
`
what
*NL*
made
you
so
surprised
at
what
I
said
?
I
would
have
you
consider
*NL*
seriously
of
it
?
You
may
see
plainly
how
the
family
stand
in
this
*NL*
case
,
and
they
would
be
stark
mad
if
it
was
my
case
,
as
it
is
my
*NL*
brother
's
;
and
for
aught
I
see
,
it
would
be
my
ruin
and
yours
too
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ay
!
'
says
I
,
still
speaking
angrily
;
`
are
all
your
protestations
and
*NL*
vows
to
be
shaken
by
the
dislike
of
the
family
?
Did
I
not
always
*NL*
object
that
to
you
,
and
you
made
light
thing
of
it
,
as
what
you
were
*NL*
above
,
and
would
value
;
and
is
it
come
to
this
now
?
'
said
I.
`
Is
this
*NL*
your
faith
and
honour
,
your
love
,
and
the
solidity
of
your
promises
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
continued
perfectly
calm
,
notwithstanding
all
my
reproaches
,
and
I
*NL*
was
not
sparing
of
them
at
all
;
but
he
replied
at
last
,
`
My
dear
,
I
*NL*
have
not
broken
one
promise
with
you
yet
;
I
did
tell
you
I
would
marry
*NL*
you
when
I
was
come
to
my
estate
;
but
you
see
my
father
is
a
hale
,
*NL*
healthy
man
,
and
may
live
these
thirty
years
still
,
and
not
be
older
*NL*
than
several
are
round
us
in
town
;
and
you
never
proposed
my
marrying
*NL*
you
sooner
,
because
you
knew
it
might
be
my
ruin
;
and
as
to
all
the
*NL*
rest
,
I
have
not
failed
you
in
anything
,
you
have
wanted
for
nothing
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
not
deny
a
word
of
this
,
and
had
nothing
to
say
to
it
in
*NL*
general
.
`
But
why
,
then
,
'
says
I
,
`
can
you
persuade
me
to
such
a
*NL*
horrid
step
as
leaving
you
,
since
you
have
not
left
me
?
Will
you
allow
*NL*
no
affection
,
no
love
on
my
side
,
where
there
has
been
so
much
on
your
*NL*
side
?
Have
I
made
you
no
returns
?
Have
I
given
no
testimony
of
my
*NL*
sincerity
and
of
my
passion
?
Are
the
sacrifices
I
have
made
of
honour
*NL*
and
modesty
to
you
no
proof
of
my
being
tied
to
you
in
bonds
too
strong
*NL*
to
be
broken
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
here
,
my
dear
,
'
says
he
,
`
you
may
come
into
a
safe
station
,
and
*NL*
appear
with
honour
and
with
splendour
at
once
,
and
the
remembrance
of
*NL*
what
we
have
done
may
be
wrapt
up
in
an
eternal
silence
,
as
if
it
had
*NL*
never
happened
;
you
shall
always
have
my
respect
,
and
my
sincere
*NL*
affection
,
only
then
it
shall
be
honest
,
and
perfectly
just
to
my
*NL*
brother
;
you
shall
be
my
dear
sister
,
as
now
you
are
my
dear
--
'
and
*NL*
there
he
stopped
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Your
dear
whore
,
'
says
I
,
`
you
would
have
said
if
you
had
gone
on
,
and
*NL*
you
might
as
well
have
said
it
;
but
I
understand
you
.
However
,
I
*NL*
desire
you
to
remember
the
long
discourses
you
have
had
with
me
,
and
*NL*
the
many
hours
'
pains
you
have
taken
to
persuade
me
to
believe
myself
*NL*
an
honest
woman
;
that
I
was
your
wife
intentionally
,
though
not
in
the
*NL*
eyes
of
the
world
,
and
that
it
was
as
effectual
a
marriage
that
had
*NL*
passed
between
us
as
is
we
had
been
publicly
wedded
by
the
parson
of
*NL*
the
parish
.
You
know
and
can
not
but
remember
that
these
have
been
your
*NL*
own
words
to
me
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
found
this
was
a
little
too
close
upon
him
,
but
I
made
it
up
in
what
*NL*
follows
.
He
stood
stock-still
for
a
while
and
said
nothing
,
and
I
went
*NL*
on
thus
:
`
You
can
not
,
'
says
I
,
`
without
the
highest
injustice
,
believe
*NL*
that
I
yielded
upon
all
these
persuasions
without
a
love
not
to
be
*NL*
questioned
,
not
to
be
shaken
again
by
anything
that
could
happen
*NL*
afterward
.
If
you
have
such
dishonourable
thoughts
of
me
,
I
must
ask
*NL*
you
what
foundation
in
any
of
my
behaviour
have
I
given
for
such
a
*NL*
suggestion
?
*NL*
*NL*
`
If
,
then
,
I
have
yielded
to
the
importunities
of
my
affection
,
and
if
*NL*
I
have
been
persuaded
to
believe
that
I
am
really
,
and
in
the
essence
*NL*
of
the
thing
,
your
wife
,
shall
I
now
give
the
lie
to
all
those
*NL*
arguments
and
call
myself
your
whore
,
or
mistress
,
which
is
the
same
*NL*
thing
?
And
will
you
transfer
me
to
your
brother
?
Can
you
transfer
my
*NL*
affection
?
Can
you
bid
me
cease
loving
you
,
and
bid
me
love
him
?
It
*NL*
is
in
my
power
,
think
you
,
to
make
such
a
change
at
demand
?
No
,
sir
,
'
*NL*
said
I
,
`
depend
upon
it
't
is
impossible
,
and
whatever
the
change
of
*NL*
your
side
may
be
,
I
will
ever
be
true
;
and
I
had
much
rather
,
since
it
*NL*
is
come
that
unhappy
length
,
be
your
whore
than
your
brother
's
wife
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
appeared
pleased
and
touched
with
the
impression
of
this
last
*NL*
discourse
,
and
told
me
that
he
stood
where
he
did
before
;
that
he
had
*NL*
not
been
unfaithful
to
me
in
any
one
promise
he
had
ever
made
yet
,
but
*NL*
that
there
were
so
many
terrible
things
presented
themselves
to
his
*NL*
view
in
the
affair
before
me
,
and
that
on
my
account
in
particular
,
*NL*
that
he
had
thought
of
the
other
as
a
remedy
so
effectual
as
nothing
*NL*
could
come
up
to
it
.
That
he
thought
this
would
not
be
entire
parting
*NL*
us
,
but
we
might
love
as
friends
all
our
days
,
and
perhaps
with
more
*NL*
satisfaction
than
we
should
in
the
station
we
were
now
in
,
as
things
*NL*
might
happen
;
that
he
durst
say
,
I
could
not
apprehend
anything
from
*NL*
him
as
to
betraying
a
secret
,
which
could
not
but
be
the
destruction
of
*NL*
us
both
,
if
it
came
out
;
that
he
had
but
one
question
to
ask
of
me
that
*NL*
could
lie
in
the
way
of
it
,
and
if
that
question
was
answered
in
the
*NL*
negative
,
he
could
not
but
think
still
it
was
the
only
step
I
could
*NL*
take
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
guessed
at
his
question
presently
,
namely
,
whether
I
was
sure
I
was
*NL*
not
with
child
?
As
to
that
,
I
told
him
he
need
not
be
concerned
about
*NL*
it
,
for
I
was
not
with
child
.
`
Why
,
then
,
my
dear
,
'
says
he
,
`
we
have
*NL*
no
time
to
talk
further
now
.
Consider
of
it
,
and
think
closely
about
*NL*
it
;
I
can
not
but
be
of
the
opinion
still
,
that
it
will
be
the
best
*NL*
course
you
can
take
.
'
And
with
this
he
took
his
leave
,
and
the
more
*NL*
hastily
too
,
his
mother
and
sisters
ringing
at
the
gate
,
just
at
the
*NL*
moment
that
he
had
risen
up
to
go
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
left
me
in
the
utmost
confusion
of
thought
;
and
he
easily
perceived
*NL*
it
the
next
day
,
and
all
the
rest
of
the
week
,
for
it
was
but
Tuesday
*NL*
evening
when
we
talked
;
but
he
had
no
opportunity
to
come
at
me
all
*NL*
that
week
,
till
the
Sunday
after
,
when
I
,
being
indisposed
,
did
not
go
*NL*
to
church
,
and
he
,
making
some
excuse
for
the
like
,
stayed
at
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
he
had
me
an
hour
and
a
half
again
by
myself
,
and
we
fell
into
*NL*
the
same
arguments
all
over
again
,
or
at
least
so
near
the
same
,
as
it
*NL*
would
be
to
no
purpose
to
repeat
them
.
At
last
I
asked
him
warmly
,
*NL*
what
opinion
he
must
have
of
my
modesty
,
that
he
could
suppose
I
should
*NL*
so
much
as
entertain
a
thought
of
lying
with
two
brothers
,
and
assured
*NL*
him
it
could
never
be
.
I
added
,
if
he
was
to
tell
me
that
he
would
*NL*
never
see
me
more
,
than
which
nothing
but
death
could
be
more
terrible
,
*NL*
yet
I
could
never
entertain
a
thought
so
dishonourable
to
myself
,
and
*NL*
so
base
to
him
;
and
therefore
,
I
entreated
him
,
if
he
had
one
grain
of
*NL*
respect
or
affection
left
for
me
,
that
he
would
speak
no
more
of
it
to
*NL*
me
,
or
that
he
would
pull
his
sword
out
and
kill
me
.
He
appeared
*NL*
surprised
at
my
obstinacy
,
as
he
called
it
;
told
me
I
was
unkind
to
*NL*
myself
,
and
unkind
to
him
in
it
;
that
it
was
a
crisis
unlooked
for
upon
*NL*
us
both
,
and
impossible
for
either
of
us
to
foresee
,
but
that
he
did
*NL*
not
see
any
other
way
to
save
us
both
from
ruin
,
and
therefore
he
*NL*
thought
it
the
more
unkind
;
but
that
if
he
must
say
no
more
of
it
to
*NL*
me
,
he
added
with
an
unusual
coldness
,
that
he
did
not
know
anything
*NL*
else
we
had
to
talk
of
;
and
so
he
rose
up
to
take
his
leave
.
I
rose
up
*NL*
too
,
as
if
with
the
same
indifference
;
but
when
he
came
to
give
me
as
*NL*
it
were
a
parting
kiss
,
I
burst
out
into
such
a
passion
of
crying
,
that
*NL*
though
I
would
have
spoke
,
I
could
not
,
and
only
pressing
his
hand
,
*NL*
seemed
to
give
him
the
adieu
,
but
cried
vehemently
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
sensibly
moved
with
this
;
so
he
sat
down
again
,
and
said
a
great
*NL*
many
kind
things
to
me
,
to
abate
the
excess
of
my
passion
,
but
still
*NL*
urged
the
necessity
of
what
he
had
proposed
;
all
the
while
insisting
,
*NL*
that
if
I
did
refuse
,
he
would
notwithstanding
provide
for
me
;
but
*NL*
letting
me
plainly
see
that
he
would
decline
me
in
the
main
point
--
nay
,
*NL*
even
as
a
mistress
;
making
it
a
point
of
honour
not
to
lie
with
the
*NL*
woman
that
,
for
aught
he
knew
,
might
come
to
be
his
brother
's
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
bare
loss
of
him
as
a
gallant
was
not
so
much
my
affliction
as
the
*NL*
loss
of
his
person
,
whom
indeed
I
loved
to
distraction
;
and
the
loss
of
*NL*
all
the
expectations
I
had
,
and
which
I
always
had
built
my
hopes
upon
,
*NL*
of
having
him
one
day
for
my
husband
.
These
things
oppressed
my
mind
*NL*
so
much
,
that
,
in
short
,
I
fell
very
ill
;
the
agonies
of
my
mind
,
in
a
*NL*
word
,
threw
me
into
a
high
fever
,
and
long
it
was
,
that
none
in
the
*NL*
family
expected
my
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
reduced
very
low
indeed
,
and
was
often
delirious
and
*NL*
light-headed
;
but
nothing
lay
so
near
me
as
the
fear
that
,
when
I
was
*NL*
light-headed
,
I
should
say
something
or
other
to
his
prejudice
.
I
was
*NL*
distressed
in
my
mind
also
to
see
him
,
and
so
he
was
to
see
me
,
for
he
*NL*
really
loved
me
most
passionately
;
but
it
could
not
be
;
there
was
not
*NL*
the
least
room
to
desire
it
on
one
side
or
other
,
or
so
much
as
to
make
*NL*
it
decent
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
near
five
weeks
that
I
kept
my
bed
and
though
the
violence
of
my
*NL*
fever
abated
in
three
weeks
,
yet
it
several
times
returned
;
and
the
*NL*
physicians
said
two
or
three
times
,
they
could
do
no
more
for
me
,
but
*NL*
that
they
must
leave
nature
and
the
distemper
to
fight
it
out
,
only
*NL*
strengthening
the
first
with
cordials
to
maintain
the
struggle
.
After
*NL*
the
end
of
five
weeks
I
grew
better
,
but
was
so
weak
,
so
altered
,
so
*NL*
melancholy
,
and
recovered
so
slowly
,
that
they
physicians
apprehended
I
*NL*
should
go
into
a
consumption
;
and
which
vexed
me
most
,
they
gave
it
as
*NL*
their
opinion
that
my
mind
was
oppressed
,
that
something
troubled
me
,
*NL*
and
,
in
short
,
that
I
was
in
love
.
Upon
this
,
the
whole
house
was
set
*NL*
upon
me
to
examine
me
,
and
to
press
me
to
tell
whether
I
was
in
love
or
*NL*
not
,
and
with
whom
;
but
as
I
well
might
,
I
denied
my
being
in
love
at
*NL*
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
on
this
occasion
a
squabble
one
day
about
me
at
table
,
that
*NL*
had
like
to
have
put
the
whole
family
in
an
uproar
,
and
for
some
time
*NL*
did
so
.
They
happened
to
be
all
at
table
but
the
father
;
as
for
me
,
I
*NL*
was
ill
,
and
in
my
chamber
.
At
the
beginning
of
the
talk
,
which
was
*NL*
just
as
they
had
finished
their
dinner
,
the
old
gentlewoman
,
who
had
*NL*
sent
me
somewhat
to
eat
,
called
her
maid
to
go
up
and
ask
me
if
I
would
*NL*
have
any
more
;
but
the
maid
brought
down
word
I
had
not
eaten
half
what
*NL*
she
had
sent
me
already
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Alas
,
says
the
old
lady
,
`
that
poor
girl
!
I
am
afraid
she
will
never
*NL*
be
well
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
!
'
says
the
elder
brother
,
`
how
should
Mrs.
Betty
be
well
?
They
*NL*
say
she
is
in
love
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
believe
nothing
of
it
,
'
says
the
old
gentlewoman
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
do
n't
know
,
'
says
the
eldest
sister
,
`
what
to
say
to
it
;
they
have
*NL*
made
such
a
rout
about
her
being
so
handsome
,
and
so
charming
,
and
I
*NL*
know
not
what
,
and
that
in
her
hearing
too
,
that
has
turned
the
*NL*
creature
's
head
,
I
believe
,
and
who
knows
what
possessions
may
follow
*NL*
such
doings
?
For
my
part
,
I
do
n't
know
what
to
make
of
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
sister
,
you
must
acknowledge
she
is
very
handsome
,
'
says
the
*NL*
elder
brother
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ay
,
and
a
great
deal
handsomer
than
you
,
sister
,
'
says
Robin
,
`
and
*NL*
that
's
your
mortification
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
well
,
that
is
not
the
question
,
'
says
his
sister
;
`
that
girl
is
*NL*
well
enough
,
and
she
knows
it
well
enough
;
she
need
not
be
told
of
it
*NL*
to
make
her
vain
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
We
are
not
talking
of
her
being
vain
,
'
says
the
elder
brother
,
`
but
of
*NL*
her
being
in
love
;
it
may
be
she
is
in
love
with
herself
;
it
seems
my
*NL*
sisters
think
so
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
would
she
was
in
love
with
me
,
'
says
Robin
;
`
I
'd
quickly
put
her
out
*NL*
of
her
pain
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
d'ye
mean
by
that
,
son
,
'
says
the
old
lady
;
`
how
can
you
talk
so
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
madam
,
'
says
Robin
,
again
,
very
honestly
,
`
do
you
think
I
'd
let
*NL*
the
poor
girl
die
for
love
,
and
of
one
that
is
near
at
hand
to
be
had
,
*NL*
too
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Fie
,
brother
!
'
,
says
the
second
sister
,
`
how
can
you
talk
so
?
Would
*NL*
you
take
a
creature
that
has
not
a
groat
in
the
world
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Prithee
,
child
,
'
says
Robin
,
`
beauty
's
a
portion
,
and
good-humour
with
*NL*
it
is
a
double
portion
;
I
wish
thou
hadst
half
her
stock
of
both
for
*NL*
thy
portion
.
'
So
there
was
her
mouth
stopped
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
find
,
'
says
the
eldest
sister
,
`
if
Betty
is
not
in
love
,
my
brother
*NL*
is
.
I
wonder
he
has
not
broke
his
mind
to
Betty
;
I
warrant
she
wo
n't
*NL*
say
No
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
They
that
yield
when
they
're
asked
,
'
says
Robin
,
`
are
one
step
before
*NL*
them
that
were
never
asked
to
yield
,
sister
,
and
two
steps
before
them
*NL*
that
yield
before
they
are
asked
;
and
that
's
an
answer
to
you
,
sister
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
This
fired
the
sister
,
and
she
flew
into
a
passion
,
and
said
,
things
*NL*
were
come
to
that
pass
that
it
was
time
the
wench
,
meaning
me
,
was
out
*NL*
of
the
family
;
and
but
that
she
was
not
fit
to
be
turned
out
,
she
hoped
*NL*
her
father
and
mother
would
consider
of
it
as
soon
as
she
could
be
*NL*
removed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Robin
replied
,
that
was
business
for
the
master
and
mistress
of
the
*NL*
family
,
who
where
not
to
be
taught
by
one
that
had
so
little
judgment
*NL*
as
his
eldest
sister
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
ran
up
a
great
deal
farther
;
the
sister
scolded
,
Robin
rallied
and
*NL*
bantered
,
but
poor
Betty
lost
ground
by
it
extremely
in
the
family
.
I
*NL*
heard
of
it
,
and
I
cried
heartily
,
and
the
old
lady
came
up
to
me
,
*NL*
somebody
having
told
her
that
I
was
so
much
concerned
about
it
.
I
*NL*
complained
to
her
,
that
it
was
very
hard
the
doctors
should
pass
such
a
*NL*
censure
upon
me
,
for
which
they
had
no
ground
;
and
that
it
was
still
*NL*
harder
,
considering
the
circumstances
I
was
under
in
the
family
;
that
I
*NL*
hoped
I
had
done
nothing
to
lessen
her
esteem
for
me
,
or
given
any
*NL*
occasion
for
the
bickering
between
her
sons
and
daughters
,
and
I
had
*NL*
more
need
to
think
of
a
coffin
than
of
being
in
love
,
and
begged
she
*NL*
would
not
let
me
suffer
in
her
opinion
for
anybody
's
mistakes
but
my
*NL*
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
sensible
of
the
justice
of
what
I
said
,
but
told
me
,
since
*NL*
there
had
been
such
a
clamour
among
them
,
and
that
her
younger
son
*NL*
talked
after
such
a
rattling
way
as
he
did
,
she
desired
I
would
be
so
*NL*
faithful
to
her
as
to
answer
her
but
one
question
sincerely
.
I
told
*NL*
her
I
would
,
with
all
my
heart
,
and
with
the
utmost
plainness
and
*NL*
sincerity
.
Why
,
then
,
the
question
was
,
whether
there
way
anything
*NL*
between
her
son
Robert
and
me
.
I
told
her
with
all
the
protestations
*NL*
of
sincerity
that
I
was
able
to
make
,
and
as
I
might
well
,
do
,
that
*NL*
there
was
not
,
nor
every
had
been
;
I
told
her
that
Mr.
Robert
had
*NL*
rattled
and
jested
,
as
she
knew
it
was
his
way
,
and
that
I
took
it
*NL*
always
,
as
I
supposed
he
meant
it
,
to
be
a
wild
airy
way
of
discourse
*NL*
that
had
no
signification
in
it
;
and
again
assured
her
,
that
there
was
*NL*
not
the
least
tittle
of
what
she
understood
by
it
between
us
;
and
that
*NL*
those
who
had
suggested
it
had
done
me
a
great
deal
of
wrong
,
and
Mr.
*NL*
Robert
no
service
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
lady
was
fully
satisfied
,
and
kissed
me
,
spoke
cheerfully
to
*NL*
me
,
and
bid
me
take
care
of
my
health
and
want
for
nothing
,
and
so
took
*NL*
her
leave
.
But
when
she
came
down
she
found
the
brother
and
all
his
*NL*
sisters
together
by
the
ears
;
they
were
angry
,
even
to
passion
,
at
his
*NL*
upbraiding
them
with
their
being
homely
,
and
having
never
had
any
*NL*
sweethearts
,
never
having
been
asked
the
question
,
and
their
being
so
*NL*
forward
as
almost
to
ask
first
.
He
rallied
them
upon
the
subject
of
*NL*
Mrs.
Betty
;
how
pretty
,
how
good-humoured
,
how
she
sung
better
then
*NL*
they
did
,
and
danced
better
,
and
how
much
handsomer
she
was
;
and
in
*NL*
doing
this
he
omitted
no
ill-natured
thing
that
could
vex
them
,
and
*NL*
indeed
,
pushed
too
hard
upon
them
.
The
old
lady
came
down
in
the
*NL*
height
of
it
,
and
to
put
a
stop
it
to
,
told
them
all
the
discourse
she
*NL*
had
had
with
me
,
and
how
I
answered
,
that
there
was
nothing
between
Mr.
*NL*
Robert
and
I.
*NL*
*NL*
`
She
's
wrong
there
,
'
says
Robin
,
`
for
if
there
was
not
a
great
deal
*NL*
between
us
,
we
should
be
closer
together
than
we
are
.
I
told
her
I
*NL*
loved
her
hugely
,
'
says
he
,
`
but
I
could
never
make
the
jade
believe
I
*NL*
was
in
earnest
.
'
'
I
do
not
know
how
you
should
,
'
says
his
mother
;
*NL*
`
nobody
in
their
senses
could
believe
you
were
in
earnest
,
to
talk
so
*NL*
to
a
poor
girl
,
whose
circumstances
you
know
so
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
prithee
,
son
,
'
adds
she
,
`
since
you
tell
me
that
you
could
not
*NL*
make
her
believe
you
were
in
earnest
,
what
must
we
believe
about
it
?
*NL*
For
you
ramble
so
in
your
discourse
,
that
nobody
knows
whether
you
are
*NL*
in
earnest
or
in
jest
;
but
as
I
find
the
girl
,
by
your
own
confession
,
*NL*
has
answered
truly
,
I
wish
you
would
do
so
too
,
and
tell
me
seriously
,
*NL*
so
that
I
may
depend
upon
it
.
Is
there
anything
in
it
or
no
?
Are
you
*NL*
in
earnest
or
no
?
Are
you
distracted
,
indeed
,
or
are
you
not
?
'T
is
a
*NL*
weighty
question
,
and
I
wish
you
would
make
us
easy
about
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
By
my
faith
,
madam
,
'
says
Robin
,
''
tis
in
vain
to
mince
the
matter
or
*NL*
tell
any
more
lies
about
it
;
I
am
in
earnest
,
as
much
as
a
man
is
*NL*
that
's
going
to
be
hanged
.
If
Mrs.
Betty
would
say
she
loved
me
,
and
*NL*
that
she
would
marry
me
,
I
'd
have
her
tomorrow
morning
fasting
,
and
*NL*
say
,
`
To
have
and
to
hold
,
'
instead
of
eating
my
breakfast
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
'
says
the
mother
,
`
then
there
's
one
son
lost
'
;
and
she
said
it
*NL*
in
a
very
mournful
tone
,
as
one
greatly
concerned
at
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
hope
not
,
madam
,
'
says
Robin
;
`
no
man
is
lost
when
a
good
wife
has
*NL*
found
him
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
but
,
child
,
'
says
the
old
lady
,
`
she
is
a
beggar
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
then
,
madam
,
she
has
the
more
need
of
charity
,
'
says
Robin
;
`
I
'll
*NL*
take
her
off
the
hands
of
the
parish
,
and
she
and
I
'll
beg
together
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
's
bad
jesting
with
such
things
,
'
says
the
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
do
n't
jest
,
madam
,
'
says
Robin
.
`
We
'll
come
and
beg
your
pardon
,
*NL*
madam
;
and
your
blessing
,
madam
,
and
my
father
's
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
This
is
all
out
of
the
way
,
son
,
'
says
the
mother
.
`
If
you
are
in
*NL*
earnest
you
are
undone
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
am
afraid
not
,
'
says
he
,
`
for
I
am
really
afraid
she
wo
n't
have
me
;
*NL*
after
all
my
sister
's
huffing
and
blustering
,
I
believe
I
shall
never
*NL*
be
able
to
persuade
her
to
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
's
a
fine
tale
,
indeed
;
she
is
not
so
far
out
of
her
senses
*NL*
neither
.
Mrs.
Betty
is
no
fool
,
'
says
the
younger
sister
.
`
Do
you
*NL*
think
she
has
learnt
to
say
No
,
any
more
than
other
people
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
Mrs.
Mirth-wit
,
'
says
Robin
,
`
Mrs.
Betty
's
no
fool
;
but
Mrs.
Betty
*NL*
may
be
engaged
some
other
way
,
and
what
then
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Nay
,
'
says
the
eldest
sister
,
`
we
can
say
nothing
to
that
.
Who
must
*NL*
it
be
to
,
then
?
She
is
never
out
of
the
doors
;
it
must
be
between
you
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
have
nothing
to
say
to
that
,
'
says
Robin
.
'
I
have
been
examined
*NL*
enough
;
there
's
my
brother
.
If
it
must
be
between
us
,
go
to
work
with
*NL*
him
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
This
stung
the
elder
brother
to
the
quick
,
and
he
concluded
that
Robin
*NL*
had
discovered
something
.
However
,
he
kept
himself
from
appearing
*NL*
disturbed
.
`
Prithee
,
'
says
he
,
`
do
n't
go
to
shame
your
stories
off
*NL*
upon
me
;
I
tell
you
,
I
deal
in
no
such
ware
;
I
have
nothing
to
say
to
*NL*
Mrs.
Betty
,
nor
to
any
of
the
Mrs.
Bettys
in
the
parish
'
;
and
with
that
*NL*
he
rose
up
and
brushed
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
'
says
the
eldest
sister
,
'
I
dare
answer
for
my
brother
;
he
knows
*NL*
the
world
better
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
the
discourse
ended
,
but
it
left
the
elder
brother
quite
*NL*
confounded
.
He
concluded
his
brother
had
made
a
full
discovery
,
and
he
*NL*
began
to
doubt
whether
I
had
been
concerned
in
it
or
not
;
but
with
all
*NL*
his
management
he
could
not
bring
it
about
to
get
at
me
.
At
last
he
*NL*
was
so
perplexed
that
he
was
quite
desperate
,
and
resolved
he
would
*NL*
come
into
my
chamber
and
see
me
,
whatever
came
of
it
.
In
order
to
do
*NL*
this
,
he
contrived
it
so
,
that
one
day
after
dinner
,
watching
his
*NL*
eldest
sister
till
he
could
see
her
go
upstairs
,
he
runs
after
her
.
*NL*
`
Hark
ye
,
sister
,
'
says
he
,
`
where
is
this
sick
woman
?
May
not
a
body
*NL*
see
her
?
'
`
Yes
,
'
says
the
sister
,
'
I
believe
you
may
;
but
let
me
go
*NL*
first
a
little
,
and
I
'll
tell
you
.
'
So
she
ran
up
to
the
door
and
gave
*NL*
me
notice
,
and
presently
called
to
him
again
.
`
Brother
,
'
says
she
,
*NL*
`
you
may
come
if
you
please
.
'
So
in
he
came
,
just
in
the
same
kind
of
*NL*
rant
.
`
Well
,
'
says
he
at
the
door
as
he
came
in
,
`
where
is
this
sick
*NL*
body
that
's
in
love
?
How
do
ye
do
,
Mrs.
Betty
?
'
I
would
have
got
up
*NL*
out
of
my
chair
,
but
was
so
weak
I
could
not
for
a
good
while
;
and
he
*NL*
saw
it
,
and
his
sister
to
,
and
she
said
,
`
Come
,
do
not
strive
to
stand
*NL*
up
;
my
brother
desires
no
ceremony
,
especially
now
you
are
so
weak
.
'
*NL*
`
No
,
no
,
Mrs.
Betty
,
pray
sit
still
,
'
says
he
,
and
so
sits
himself
down
*NL*
in
a
chair
over
against
me
,
and
appeared
as
if
he
was
mighty
merry
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
talked
a
lot
of
rambling
stuff
to
his
sister
and
to
me
,
sometimes
of
*NL*
one
thing
,
sometimes
of
another
,
on
purpose
to
amuse
his
sister
,
and
*NL*
every
now
and
then
would
turn
it
upon
the
old
story
,
directing
it
to
*NL*
me
.
`
Poor
Mrs.
Betty
,
'
says
he
,
`
it
is
a
sad
thing
to
be
in
love
;
why
,
*NL*
it
has
reduced
you
sadly
.
'
At
last
I
spoke
a
little
.
'
I
am
glad
to
*NL*
see
you
so
merry
,
sir
,
'
says
I
;
`
but
I
think
the
doctor
might
have
*NL*
found
something
better
to
do
than
to
make
his
game
at
his
patients
.
If
*NL*
I
had
been
ill
of
no
other
distemper
,
I
know
the
proverb
too
well
to
*NL*
have
let
him
come
to
me
.
'
`
What
proverb
?
'
says
he
,
`
Oh
!
I
remember
it
*NL*
now
.
What
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
love
is
the
case
,
*NL*
The
doctor
's
an
ass
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Is
not
that
it
,
Mrs.
Betty
?
'
I
smiled
and
said
nothing
.
`
Nay
,
'
says
*NL*
he
,
'
I
think
the
effect
has
proved
it
to
be
love
,
for
it
seems
the
*NL*
doctor
has
been
able
to
do
you
but
little
service
;
you
mend
very
*NL*
slowly
,
they
say
.
I
doubt
there
's
somewhat
in
it
,
Mrs.
Betty
;
I
doubt
*NL*
you
are
sick
of
the
incurables
,
and
that
is
love
.
'
I
smiled
and
said
,
*NL*
`
No
,
indeed
,
sir
,
that
's
none
of
my
distemper
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
a
deal
of
such
discourse
,
and
sometimes
others
that
signified
as
*NL*
little
.
By
and
by
he
asked
me
to
sing
them
a
song
,
at
which
I
smiled
,
*NL*
and
said
my
singing
days
were
over
.
At
last
he
asked
me
if
he
should
*NL*
play
upon
his
flute
to
me
;
his
sister
said
she
believe
it
would
hurt
*NL*
me
,
and
that
my
head
could
not
bear
it
.
I
bowed
,
and
said
,
No
,
it
*NL*
would
not
hurt
me
.
`
And
,
pray
,
madam
.
'
said
I
,
`
do
not
hinder
it
;
I
*NL*
love
the
music
of
the
flute
very
much
.
'
Then
his
sister
said
,
`
Well
,
*NL*
do
,
then
,
brother
.
'
With
that
he
pulled
out
the
key
of
his
closet
.
*NL*
`
Dear
sister
,
'
says
he
,
'
I
am
very
lazy
;
do
step
to
my
closet
and
fetch
*NL*
my
flute
;
it
lies
in
such
a
drawer
,
'
naming
a
place
where
he
was
sure
*NL*
it
was
not
,
that
she
might
be
a
little
while
a-looking
for
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
she
was
gone
,
he
related
the
whole
story
to
me
of
the
*NL*
discourse
his
brother
had
about
me
,
and
of
his
pushing
it
at
him
,
and
*NL*
his
concern
about
it
,
which
was
the
reason
of
his
contriving
this
visit
*NL*
to
me
.
I
assured
him
I
had
never
opened
my
mouth
either
to
his
brother
*NL*
or
to
anybody
else
.
I
told
him
the
dreadful
exigence
I
was
in
;
that
my
*NL*
love
to
him
,
and
his
offering
to
have
me
forget
that
affection
and
*NL*
remove
it
to
another
,
had
thrown
me
down
;
and
that
I
had
a
thousand
*NL*
times
wished
I
might
die
rather
than
recover
,
and
to
have
the
same
*NL*
circumstances
to
struggle
with
as
I
had
before
,
and
that
his
*NL*
backwardness
to
life
had
been
the
great
reason
of
the
slowness
of
my
*NL*
recovering
.
I
added
that
I
foresaw
that
as
soon
as
I
was
well
,
I
must
*NL*
quit
the
family
,
and
that
as
for
marrying
his
brother
,
I
abhorred
the
*NL*
thoughts
of
it
after
what
had
been
my
case
with
him
,
and
that
he
might
*NL*
depend
upon
it
I
would
never
see
his
brother
again
upon
that
subject
;
*NL*
that
if
he
would
break
all
his
vows
and
oaths
and
engagements
with
me
,
*NL*
be
that
between
his
conscience
and
his
honour
and
himself
;
but
he
*NL*
should
never
be
able
to
say
that
I
,
whom
he
had
persuaded
to
call
*NL*
myself
his
wife
,
and
who
had
given
him
the
liberty
to
use
me
as
a
wife
,
*NL*
was
not
as
faithful
to
him
as
a
wife
ought
to
be
,
whatever
he
might
be
*NL*
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
going
to
reply
,
and
had
said
that
he
was
sorry
I
could
not
be
*NL*
persuaded
,
and
was
a-going
to
say
more
,
but
he
heard
his
sister
*NL*
a-coming
,
and
so
did
I
;
and
yet
I
forced
out
these
few
words
as
a
*NL*
reply
,
that
I
could
never
be
persuaded
to
love
one
brother
and
marry
*NL*
another
.
He
shook
his
head
and
said
,
`
Then
I
am
ruined
,
'
meaning
*NL*
himself
;
and
that
moment
his
sister
entered
the
room
and
told
him
she
*NL*
could
not
find
the
flute
.
`
Well
,
'
says
he
merrily
,
`
this
laziness
wo
n't
*NL*
do
'
;
so
he
gets
up
and
goes
himself
to
go
to
look
for
it
,
but
comes
*NL*
back
without
it
too
;
not
but
that
he
could
have
found
it
,
but
because
*NL*
his
mind
was
a
little
disturbed
,
and
he
had
no
mind
to
play
;
and
,
*NL*
besides
,
the
errand
he
sent
his
sister
on
was
answered
another
way
;
for
*NL*
he
only
wanted
an
opportunity
to
speak
to
me
,
which
he
gained
,
though
*NL*
not
much
to
his
satisfaction
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
,
however
,
a
great
deal
of
satisfaction
in
having
spoken
my
mind
*NL*
to
him
with
freedom
,
and
with
such
an
honest
plainness
,
as
I
have
*NL*
related
;
and
though
it
did
not
at
all
work
the
way
I
desired
,
that
is
*NL*
to
say
,
to
oblige
the
person
to
me
the
more
,
yet
it
took
from
him
all
*NL*
possibility
of
quitting
me
but
by
a
downright
breach
of
honour
,
and
*NL*
giving
up
all
the
faith
of
a
gentleman
to
me
,
which
he
had
so
often
*NL*
engaged
by
,
never
to
abandon
me
,
but
to
make
me
his
wife
as
soon
as
he
*NL*
came
to
his
estate
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
many
weeks
after
this
before
I
was
about
the
house
again
,
*NL*
and
began
to
grow
well
;
but
I
continued
melancholy
,
silent
,
dull
,
and
*NL*
retired
,
which
amazed
the
whole
family
,
except
he
that
knew
the
reason
*NL*
of
it
;
yet
it
was
a
great
while
before
he
took
any
notice
of
it
,
and
I
,
*NL*
as
backward
to
speak
as
he
,
carried
respectfully
to
him
,
but
never
*NL*
offered
to
speak
a
word
to
him
that
was
particular
of
any
kind
*NL*
whatsoever
;
and
this
continued
for
sixteen
or
seventeen
weeks
;
so
that
,
*NL*
as
I
expected
every
day
to
be
dismissed
the
family
,
on
account
of
what
*NL*
distaste
they
had
taken
another
way
,
in
which
I
had
no
guilt
,
so
I
*NL*
expected
to
hear
no
more
of
this
gentleman
,
after
all
his
solemn
vows
*NL*
and
protestations
,
but
to
be
ruined
and
abandoned
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
I
broke
the
way
myself
in
the
family
for
my
removing
;
for
being
*NL*
talking
seriously
with
the
old
lady
one
day
,
about
my
own
circumstances
*NL*
in
the
world
,
and
how
my
distemper
had
left
a
heaviness
upon
my
*NL*
spirits
,
that
I
was
not
the
same
thing
I
was
before
,
the
old
lady
said
,
*NL*
'
I
am
afraid
,
Betty
,
what
I
have
said
to
you
about
my
son
has
had
some
*NL*
influence
upon
you
,
and
that
you
are
melancholy
on
his
account
;
pray
,
*NL*
will
you
let
me
know
how
the
matter
stands
with
you
both
,
if
it
may
not
*NL*
be
improper
?
For
,
as
for
Robin
,
he
does
nothing
but
rally
and
banter
*NL*
when
I
speak
of
it
to
him
.
'
`
Why
,
truly
,
madam
,
'
said
I
`
that
matter
*NL*
stands
as
I
wish
it
did
not
,
and
I
shall
be
very
sincere
with
you
in
*NL*
it
,
whatever
befalls
me
for
it
.
Mr.
Robert
has
several
times
proposed
*NL*
marriage
to
me
,
which
is
what
I
had
no
reason
to
expect
,
my
poor
*NL*
circumstances
considered
;
but
I
have
always
resisted
him
,
and
that
*NL*
perhaps
in
terms
more
positive
than
became
me
,
considering
the
regard
*NL*
that
I
ought
to
have
for
every
branch
of
your
family
;
but
,
'
said
I
,
*NL*
`
madam
,
I
could
never
so
far
forget
my
obligation
to
you
and
all
your
*NL*
house
,
to
offer
to
consent
to
a
thing
which
I
know
must
needs
be
*NL*
disobliging
to
you
,
and
this
I
have
made
my
argument
to
him
,
and
have
*NL*
positively
told
him
that
I
would
never
entertain
a
thought
of
that
kind
*NL*
unless
I
had
your
consent
,
and
his
father
's
also
,
to
whom
I
was
bound
*NL*
by
so
many
invincible
obligations
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
is
this
possible
,
Mrs.
Betty
?
'
says
the
old
lady
.
`
Then
you
have
*NL*
been
much
juster
to
us
than
we
have
been
to
you
;
for
we
have
all
looked
*NL*
upon
you
as
a
kind
of
snare
to
my
son
,
and
I
had
a
proposal
to
make
to
*NL*
you
for
your
removing
,
for
fear
of
it
;
but
I
had
not
yet
mentioned
it
*NL*
to
you
,
because
I
thought
you
were
not
thorough
well
,
and
I
was
afraid
*NL*
of
grieving
you
too
much
,
lest
it
should
throw
you
down
again
;
for
we
*NL*
have
all
a
respect
for
you
still
,
though
not
so
much
as
to
have
it
be
*NL*
the
ruin
of
my
son
;
but
if
it
be
as
you
say
,
we
have
all
wronged
you
*NL*
very
much
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
As
to
the
truth
of
what
I
say
,
madam
,
'
said
I
,
`
refer
you
to
your
son
*NL*
himself
;
if
he
will
do
me
any
justice
,
he
must
tell
you
the
story
just
*NL*
as
I
have
told
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Away
goes
the
old
lady
to
her
daughters
and
tells
them
the
whole
story
,
*NL*
just
as
I
had
told
it
her
;
and
they
were
surprised
at
it
,
you
may
be
*NL*
sure
,
as
I
believed
they
would
be
.
One
said
she
could
never
have
*NL*
thought
it
;
another
said
Robin
was
a
fool
;
a
third
said
she
would
not
*NL*
believe
a
word
of
it
,
and
she
would
warrant
that
Robin
would
tell
the
*NL*
story
another
way
.
But
the
old
gentlewoman
,
who
was
resolved
to
go
to
*NL*
the
bottom
of
it
before
I
could
have
the
least
opportunity
of
*NL*
acquainting
her
son
with
what
had
passed
,
resolved
too
that
she
would
*NL*
talk
with
her
son
immediately
,
and
to
that
purpose
sent
for
him
,
for
he
*NL*
was
gone
but
to
a
lawyer
's
house
in
the
town
,
upon
some
petty
business
*NL*
of
his
own
,
and
upon
her
sending
he
returned
immediately
.
*NL*
*NL*
Upon
his
coming
up
to
them
,
for
they
were
all
still
together
,
`
Sit
*NL*
down
,
Robin
,
'
says
the
old
lady
,
'
I
must
have
some
talk
with
you
.
'
*NL*
`
With
all
my
heart
,
madam
,
'
says
Robin
,
looking
very
merry
.
'
I
hope
it
*NL*
is
about
a
good
wife
,
for
I
am
at
a
great
loss
in
that
affair
.
'
`
How
*NL*
can
that
be
?
'
says
his
mother
;
`
did
not
you
say
you
resolved
to
have
*NL*
Mrs.
Betty
?
'
`
Ay
,
madam
,
'
says
Robin
,
`
but
there
is
one
has
forbid
the
*NL*
banns
.
'
`
Forbid
,
the
banns
!
'
says
his
mother
;
`
who
can
that
be
?
'
`
Even
*NL*
Mrs.
Betty
herself
,
'
says
Robin
.
`
How
so
?
'
says
his
mother
.
`
Have
you
*NL*
asked
her
the
question
,
then
?
'
`
Yes
,
indeed
,
madam
,
'
says
Robin
.
'
I
*NL*
have
attacked
her
in
form
five
times
since
she
was
sick
,
and
am
beaten
*NL*
off
;
the
jade
is
so
stout
she
wo
n't
capitulate
nor
yield
upon
any
*NL*
terms
,
except
such
as
I
can
not
effectually
grant
.
'
`
Explain
yourself
,
'
*NL*
says
the
mother
,
`
for
I
am
surprised
;
I
do
not
understand
you
.
I
hope
*NL*
you
are
not
in
earnest
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
madam
,
'
says
he
,
`
the
case
is
plain
enough
upon
me
,
it
explains
*NL*
itself
;
she
wo
n't
have
me
,
she
says
;
is
not
that
plain
enough
?
I
think
*NL*
't
is
plain
,
and
pretty
rough
too
.
'
`
Well
,
but
,
'
says
the
mother
,
`
you
*NL*
talk
of
conditions
that
you
can
not
grant
;
what
does
she
want
--
a
*NL*
settlement
?
Her
jointure
ought
to
be
according
to
her
portion
;
but
*NL*
what
fortune
does
she
bring
you
?
'
`
Nay
,
as
to
fortune
,
'
says
Robin
,
*NL*
`
she
is
rich
enough
;
I
am
satisfied
in
that
point
;
but
't
is
I
that
am
*NL*
not
able
to
come
up
to
her
terms
,
and
she
is
positive
she
will
not
have
*NL*
me
without
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Here
the
sisters
put
in
.
`
Madam
,
'
says
the
second
sister
,
''
tis
*NL*
impossible
to
be
serious
with
him
;
he
will
never
give
a
direct
answer
*NL*
to
anything
;
you
had
better
let
him
alone
,
and
talk
no
more
of
it
to
*NL*
him
;
you
know
how
to
dispose
of
her
out
of
his
way
if
you
thought
there
*NL*
was
anything
in
it
.
'
Robin
was
a
little
warmed
with
his
sister
's
*NL*
rudeness
,
but
he
was
even
with
her
,
and
yet
with
good
manners
too
.
*NL*
`
There
are
two
sorts
of
people
,
madam
,
'
says
he
,
turning
to
his
mother
,
*NL*
`
that
there
is
no
contending
with
;
that
is
,
a
wise
body
and
a
fool
;
*NL*
't
is
a
little
hard
I
should
engage
with
both
of
them
together
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
younger
sister
then
put
in
.
`
We
must
be
fools
indeed
,
'
says
she
,
*NL*
`
in
my
brother
's
opinion
,
that
he
should
think
we
can
believe
he
has
*NL*
seriously
asked
Mrs.
Betty
to
marry
him
,
and
that
she
has
refused
him
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Answer
,
and
answer
not
,
say
Solomon
,
'
replied
her
brother
.
`
When
your
*NL*
brother
had
said
to
your
mother
that
he
had
asked
her
no
less
than
five
*NL*
times
,
and
that
it
was
so
,
that
she
positively
denied
him
,
methinks
a
*NL*
younger
sister
need
not
question
the
truth
of
it
when
her
mother
did
*NL*
not
.
'
`
My
mother
,
you
see
,
did
not
understand
it
,
'
says
the
second
*NL*
sister
.
`
There
's
some
difference
,
'
says
Robin
,
`
between
desiring
me
to
*NL*
explain
it
,
and
telling
me
she
did
not
believe
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
but
,
son
,
'
says
the
old
lady
,
`
if
you
are
disposed
to
let
us
*NL*
into
the
mystery
of
it
,
what
were
these
hard
conditions
?
'
`
Yes
,
madam
,
'
*NL*
says
Robin
,
'
I
had
done
it
before
now
,
if
the
teasers
here
had
not
*NL*
worried
my
by
way
of
interruption
.
The
conditions
are
,
that
I
bring
my
*NL*
father
and
you
to
consent
to
it
,
and
without
that
she
protests
she
will
*NL*
never
see
me
more
upon
that
head
;
and
to
these
conditions
,
as
I
said
,
I
*NL*
suppose
I
shall
never
be
able
to
grant
.
I
hope
my
warm
sisters
will
be
*NL*
answered
now
,
and
blush
a
little
;
if
not
,
I
have
no
more
to
say
till
I
*NL*
hear
further
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
This
answer
was
surprising
to
them
all
,
though
less
to
the
mother
,
*NL*
because
of
what
I
had
said
to
her
.
As
to
the
daughters
,
they
stood
*NL*
mute
a
great
while
;
but
the
mother
said
with
some
passion
,
`
Well
,
I
had
*NL*
heard
this
before
,
but
I
could
not
believe
it
;
but
if
it
is
so
,
they
we
*NL*
have
all
done
Betty
wrong
,
and
she
has
behaved
better
than
I
ever
*NL*
expected
.
'
`
Nay
,
'
says
the
eldest
sister
,
`
if
it
be
so
,
she
has
acted
*NL*
handsomely
indeed
.
'
'
I
confess
,
'
says
the
mother
,
`
it
was
none
of
her
*NL*
fault
,
if
he
was
fool
enough
to
take
a
fancy
to
her
;
but
to
give
such
*NL*
an
answer
to
him
,
shows
more
respect
to
your
father
and
me
than
I
can
*NL*
tell
how
to
express
;
I
shall
value
the
girl
the
better
for
it
as
long
*NL*
as
I
know
her
.
'
`
But
I
shall
not
,
'
says
Robin
,
`
unless
you
will
give
*NL*
your
consent
.
'
`
I
'll
consider
of
that
a
while
,
'
says
the
mother
;
'
I
*NL*
assure
you
,
if
there
were
not
some
other
objections
in
the
way
,
this
*NL*
conduct
of
hers
would
go
a
great
way
to
bring
me
to
consent
.
'
'
I
wish
*NL*
it
would
go
quite
through
it
,
'
says
Robin
;
`
if
you
had
a
much
thought
*NL*
about
making
me
easy
as
you
have
about
making
me
rich
,
you
would
soon
*NL*
consent
to
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
Robin
,
'
says
the
mother
again
,
`
are
you
really
in
earnest
?
Would
*NL*
you
so
fain
have
her
as
you
pretend
?
'
`
Really
,
madam
,
'
says
Robin
,
'
I
*NL*
think
't
is
hard
you
should
question
me
upon
that
head
after
all
I
have
*NL*
said
.
I
wo
n't
say
that
I
will
have
her
;
how
can
I
resolve
that
point
,
*NL*
when
you
see
I
can
not
have
her
without
your
consent
?
Besides
,
I
am
not
*NL*
bound
to
marry
at
all
.
But
this
I
will
say
,
I
am
in
earnest
in
,
that
I
*NL*
will
never
have
anybody
else
if
I
can
help
it
;
so
you
may
determine
for
*NL*
me
.
Betty
or
nobody
is
the
word
,
and
the
question
which
of
the
two
*NL*
shall
be
in
your
breast
to
decide
,
madam
,
provided
only
,
that
my
*NL*
good-humoured
sisters
here
may
have
no
vote
in
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
was
dreadful
to
me
,
for
the
mother
began
to
yield
,
and
Robin
*NL*
pressed
her
home
on
it
.
On
the
other
hand
,
she
advised
with
the
eldest
*NL*
son
,
and
he
used
all
the
arguments
in
the
world
to
persuade
her
to
*NL*
consent
;
alleging
his
brother
's
passionate
love
for
me
,
and
my
generous
*NL*
regard
to
the
family
,
in
refusing
my
own
advantages
upon
such
a
nice
*NL*
point
of
honour
,
and
a
thousand
such
things
.
And
as
to
the
father
,
he
*NL*
was
a
man
in
a
hurry
of
public
affairs
and
getting
money
,
seldom
at
*NL*
home
,
thoughtful
of
the
main
chance
,
but
left
all
those
things
to
his
*NL*
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
You
may
easily
believe
,
that
when
the
plot
was
thus
,
as
they
thought
,
*NL*
broke
out
,
and
that
every
one
thought
they
knew
how
things
were
*NL*
carried
,
it
was
not
so
difficult
or
so
dangerous
for
the
elder
brother
,
*NL*
whom
nobody
suspected
of
anything
,
to
have
a
freer
access
to
me
than
*NL*
before
;
nay
,
the
mother
,
which
was
just
as
he
wished
,
proposed
it
to
*NL*
him
to
talk
with
Mrs.
Betty
.
`
For
it
may
be
,
son
,
'
said
she
,
`
you
may
*NL*
see
farther
into
the
thing
than
I
,
and
see
if
you
think
she
has
been
so
*NL*
positive
as
Robin
says
she
has
been
,
or
no
.
'
This
was
as
well
as
he
*NL*
could
wish
,
and
he
,
as
it
were
,
yielding
to
talk
with
me
at
his
*NL*
mother
's
request
,
she
brought
me
to
him
into
her
own
chamber
,
told
me
*NL*
her
son
had
some
business
with
me
at
her
request
,
and
desired
me
to
be
*NL*
very
sincere
with
him
,
and
then
she
left
us
together
,
and
he
went
and
*NL*
shut
the
door
after
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
came
back
to
me
and
took
me
in
his
arms
,
and
kissed
me
very
*NL*
tenderly
;
but
told
me
he
had
a
long
discourse
to
hold
with
me
,
and
it
*NL*
was
not
come
to
that
crisis
,
that
I
should
make
myself
happy
or
*NL*
miserable
as
long
as
I
lived
;
that
the
thing
was
now
gone
so
far
,
that
*NL*
if
I
could
not
comply
with
his
desire
,
we
would
both
be
ruined
.
Then
*NL*
he
told
the
whole
story
between
Robin
,
as
he
called
him
,
and
his
mother
*NL*
and
sisters
and
himself
,
as
it
is
above
.
`
And
now
,
dear
child
,
'
says
*NL*
he
,
`
consider
what
it
will
be
to
marry
a
gentleman
of
a
good
family
,
in
*NL*
good
circumstances
,
and
with
the
consent
of
the
whole
house
,
and
to
*NL*
enjoy
all
that
he
world
can
give
you
;
and
what
,
on
the
other
hand
,
to
*NL*
be
sunk
into
the
dark
circumstances
of
a
woman
that
has
lost
her
*NL*
reputation
;
and
that
though
I
shall
be
a
private
friend
to
you
while
I
*NL*
live
,
yet
as
I
shall
be
suspected
always
,
so
you
will
be
afraid
to
see
*NL*
me
,
and
I
shall
be
afraid
to
own
you
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
gave
me
no
time
to
reply
,
but
went
on
with
me
thus
:
`
What
has
*NL*
happened
between
us
,
child
,
so
long
as
we
both
agree
to
do
so
,
may
be
*NL*
buried
and
forgotten
.
I
shall
always
be
your
sincere
friend
,
without
*NL*
any
inclination
to
nearer
intimacy
,
when
you
become
my
sister
;
and
we
*NL*
shall
have
all
the
honest
part
of
conversation
without
any
reproaches
*NL*
between
us
of
having
done
amiss
.
I
beg
of
you
to
consider
it
,
and
to
*NL*
not
stand
in
the
way
of
your
own
safety
and
prosperity
;
and
to
satisfy
*NL*
you
that
I
am
sincere
,
'
added
he
,
'
I
here
offer
you
#
500
in
money
,
to
*NL*
make
you
some
amends
for
the
freedoms
I
have
taken
with
you
,
which
we
*NL*
shall
look
upon
as
some
of
the
follies
of
our
lives
,
which
't
is
hoped
*NL*
we
may
repent
of
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
spoke
this
in
so
much
more
moving
terms
than
it
is
possible
for
me
*NL*
to
express
,
and
with
so
much
greater
force
of
argument
than
I
can
*NL*
repeat
,
that
I
only
recommend
it
to
those
who
read
the
story
,
to
*NL*
suppose
,
that
as
he
held
me
above
an
hour
and
a
half
in
that
discourse
,
*NL*
so
he
answered
all
my
objections
,
and
fortified
his
discourse
with
all
*NL*
the
arguments
that
human
wit
and
art
could
devise
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
can
not
say
,
however
,
that
anything
he
said
made
impression
enough
*NL*
upon
me
so
as
to
give
me
any
thought
of
the
matter
,
till
he
told
me
at
*NL*
last
very
plainly
,
that
if
I
refused
,
he
was
sorry
to
add
that
he
could
*NL*
never
go
on
with
me
in
that
station
as
we
stood
before
;
that
though
he
*NL*
loved
me
as
well
as
ever
,
and
that
I
was
as
agreeable
to
him
as
ever
,
*NL*
yet
sense
of
virtue
had
not
so
far
forsaken
him
as
to
suffer
him
to
lie
*NL*
with
a
woman
that
his
brother
courted
to
make
his
wife
;
and
if
he
took
*NL*
his
leave
of
me
,
with
a
denial
in
this
affair
,
whatever
he
might
do
for
*NL*
me
in
the
point
of
support
,
grounded
on
his
first
engagement
of
*NL*
maintaining
me
,
yet
he
would
not
have
me
be
surprised
that
he
was
*NL*
obliged
to
tell
me
he
could
not
allow
himself
to
see
me
any
more
;
and
*NL*
that
,
indeed
,
I
could
not
expect
it
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
received
this
last
part
with
some
token
of
surprise
and
disorder
,
and
*NL*
had
much
ado
to
avoid
sinking
down
,
for
indeed
I
loved
him
to
an
*NL*
extravagance
not
easy
to
imagine
;
but
he
perceived
my
disorder
.
He
*NL*
entreated
me
to
consider
seriously
of
it
;
assured
me
that
it
was
the
*NL*
only
way
to
preserve
our
mutual
affection
;
that
in
this
station
we
*NL*
might
love
as
friends
,
with
the
utmost
passion
,
and
with
a
love
of
*NL*
relation
untainted
,
free
from
our
just
reproaches
,
and
free
from
other
*NL*
people
's
suspicions
;
that
he
should
ever
acknowledge
his
happiness
*NL*
owing
to
me
;
that
he
would
be
debtor
to
me
as
long
as
he
lived
,
and
*NL*
would
be
paying
that
debt
as
long
as
he
had
breath
.
Thus
he
wrought
me
*NL*
up
,
in
short
,
to
a
kind
of
hesitation
in
the
matter
;
having
the
dangers
*NL*
on
one
side
represented
in
lively
figures
,
and
indeed
,
heightened
by
my
*NL*
imagination
of
being
turned
out
to
the
wide
world
a
mere
cast-off
*NL*
whore
,
for
it
was
no
less
,
and
perhaps
exposed
as
such
,
with
little
to
*NL*
provide
for
myself
,
with
no
friend
,
no
acquaintance
in
the
whole
world
,
*NL*
out
of
that
town
,
and
there
I
could
not
pretend
to
stay
.
All
this
*NL*
terrified
me
to
the
last
degree
,
and
he
took
care
upon
all
occasions
to
*NL*
lay
it
home
to
me
in
the
worst
colours
that
it
could
be
possible
to
be
*NL*
drawn
in
.
On
the
other
hand
,
he
failed
not
to
set
forth
the
easy
,
*NL*
prosperous
life
which
I
was
going
to
live
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
answered
all
that
I
could
object
from
affection
,
and
from
former
*NL*
engagements
,
with
telling
me
the
necessity
that
was
before
us
of
taking
*NL*
other
measures
now
;
and
as
to
his
promises
of
marriage
,
the
nature
of
*NL*
things
,
he
said
,
had
put
an
end
to
that
,
by
the
probability
of
my
being
*NL*
his
brother
's
wife
,
before
the
time
to
which
his
promises
all
referred
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
,
in
a
word
,
I
may
say
,
he
reasoned
me
out
of
my
reason
;
he
*NL*
conquered
all
my
arguments
,
and
I
began
to
see
a
danger
that
I
was
in
,
*NL*
which
I
had
not
considered
of
before
,
and
that
was
,
of
being
dropped
by
*NL*
both
of
them
and
left
alone
in
the
world
to
shift
for
myself
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
,
and
his
persuasion
,
at
length
prevailed
with
me
to
consent
,
*NL*
though
with
so
much
reluctance
,
that
it
was
easy
to
see
I
should
go
to
*NL*
church
like
a
bear
to
the
stake
.
I
had
some
little
apprehensions
about
*NL*
me
,
too
,
lest
my
new
spouse
,
who
,
by
the
way
,
I
had
not
the
least
*NL*
affection
for
,
should
be
skillful
enough
to
challenge
me
on
another
*NL*
account
,
upon
our
first
coming
to
bed
together
.
But
whether
he
did
it
*NL*
with
design
or
not
,
I
know
not
,
but
his
elder
brother
took
care
to
make
*NL*
him
very
much
fuddled
before
he
went
to
bed
,
so
that
I
had
the
*NL*
satisfaction
of
a
drunken
bedfellow
the
first
night
.
How
he
did
it
I
*NL*
know
not
,
but
I
concluded
that
he
certainly
contrived
it
,
that
his
*NL*
brother
might
be
able
to
make
no
judgment
of
the
difference
between
a
*NL*
maid
and
a
married
woman
;
nor
did
he
ever
entertain
any
notions
of
it
,
*NL*
or
disturb
his
thoughts
about
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
should
go
back
a
little
here
to
where
I
left
off
.
The
elder
brother
*NL*
having
thus
managed
me
,
his
next
business
was
to
manage
his
mother
,
and
*NL*
he
never
left
till
he
had
brought
her
to
acquiesce
and
be
passive
in
*NL*
the
thing
,
even
without
acquainting
the
father
,
other
than
by
post
*NL*
letters
;
so
that
she
consented
to
our
marrying
privately
,
and
leaving
*NL*
her
to
mange
the
father
afterwards
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
cajoled
with
his
brother
,
and
persuaded
him
what
service
he
had
*NL*
done
him
,
and
how
he
had
brought
his
mother
to
consent
,
which
,
though
*NL*
true
,
was
not
indeed
done
to
serve
him
,
but
to
serve
himself
;
but
thus
*NL*
diligently
did
he
cheat
him
,
and
had
the
thanks
of
a
faithful
friend
*NL*
for
shifting
off
his
whore
into
his
brother
's
arms
for
a
wife
.
So
*NL*
certainly
does
interest
banish
all
manner
of
affection
,
and
so
*NL*
naturally
do
men
give
up
honour
and
justice
,
humanity
,
and
even
*NL*
Christianity
,
to
secure
themselves
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
must
now
come
back
to
brother
Robin
,
as
we
always
called
him
,
who
*NL*
having
got
his
mother
's
consent
,
as
above
,
came
big
with
the
news
to
*NL*
me
,
and
told
me
the
whole
story
of
it
,
with
a
sincerity
so
visible
,
*NL*
that
I
must
confess
it
grieved
me
that
I
must
be
the
instrument
to
*NL*
abuse
so
honest
a
gentleman
.
But
there
was
no
remedy
;
he
would
have
*NL*
me
,
and
I
was
not
obliged
to
tell
him
that
I
was
his
brother
's
whore
,
*NL*
though
I
had
no
other
way
to
put
him
off
;
so
I
came
gradually
into
it
,
*NL*
to
his
satisfaction
,
and
behold
we
were
married
.
*NL*
*NL*
Modesty
forbids
me
to
reveal
the
secrets
of
the
marriage-bed
,
but
*NL*
nothing
could
have
happened
more
suitable
to
my
circumstances
than
*NL*
that
,
as
above
,
my
husband
was
so
fuddled
when
he
came
to
bed
,
that
he
*NL*
could
not
remember
in
the
morning
whether
he
had
had
any
conversation
*NL*
with
me
or
no
,
and
I
was
obliged
to
tell
him
he
had
,
though
in
reality
*NL*
he
had
not
,
that
I
might
be
sure
he
could
make
to
inquiry
about
*NL*
anything
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
concerns
the
story
in
hand
very
little
to
enter
into
the
further
*NL*
particulars
of
the
family
,
or
of
myself
,
for
the
five
years
that
I
*NL*
lived
with
this
husband
,
only
to
observe
that
I
had
two
children
by
*NL*
him
,
and
that
at
the
end
of
five
years
he
died
.
He
had
been
really
a
*NL*
very
good
husband
to
me
,
and
we
lived
very
agreeably
together
;
but
as
*NL*
he
had
not
received
much
from
them
,
and
had
in
the
little
time
he
lived
*NL*
acquired
no
great
matters
,
so
my
circumstances
were
not
great
,
nor
was
*NL*
I
much
mended
by
the
match
.
Indeed
,
I
had
preserved
the
elder
*NL*
brother
's
bonds
to
me
,
to
pay
#
500
,
which
he
offered
me
for
my
consent
*NL*
to
marry
his
brother
;
and
this
,
with
what
I
had
saved
of
the
money
he
*NL*
formerly
gave
me
,
about
as
much
more
by
my
husband
,
left
me
a
widow
*NL*
with
about
#
1200
in
my
pocket
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
two
children
were
,
indeed
,
taken
happily
off
my
hands
by
my
*NL*
husband
's
father
and
mother
,
and
that
,
by
the
way
,
was
all
they
got
by
*NL*
Mrs.
Betty
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
confess
I
was
not
suitably
affected
with
the
loss
of
my
husband
,
nor
*NL*
indeed
can
I
say
that
I
ever
loved
him
as
I
ought
to
have
done
,
or
as
*NL*
was
proportionable
to
the
good
usage
I
had
from
him
,
for
he
was
a
*NL*
tender
,
kind
,
good-humoured
man
as
any
woman
could
desire
;
but
his
*NL*
brother
being
so
always
in
my
sight
,
at
least
while
we
were
in
the
*NL*
country
,
was
a
continual
snare
to
me
,
and
I
never
was
in
bed
with
my
*NL*
husband
but
I
wished
myself
in
the
arms
of
his
brother
;
and
though
his
*NL*
brother
never
offered
me
the
least
kindness
that
way
after
our
*NL*
marriage
,
but
carried
it
just
as
a
brother
out
to
do
,
yet
it
was
*NL*
impossible
for
me
to
do
so
to
him
;
in
short
,
I
committed
adultery
and
*NL*
incest
with
him
every
day
in
my
desires
,
which
,
without
doubt
,
was
as
*NL*
effectually
criminal
in
the
nature
of
the
guilt
as
if
I
had
actually
*NL*
done
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
my
husband
died
his
elder
brother
was
married
,
and
we
,
being
*NL*
then
removed
to
London
,
were
written
to
by
the
old
lady
to
come
and
be
*NL*
at
the
wedding
.
My
husband
went
,
but
I
pretended
indisposition
,
and
*NL*
that
I
could
not
possibly
travel
,
so
I
stayed
behind
;
for
,
in
short
,
I
*NL*
could
not
bear
the
sight
of
his
being
given
to
another
woman
,
though
I
*NL*
knew
I
was
never
to
have
him
myself
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
now
,
as
above
,
left
loose
to
the
world
,
and
being
still
young
and
*NL*
handsome
,
as
everybody
said
of
me
,
and
I
assure
you
I
thought
myself
*NL*
so
,
and
with
a
tolerable
fortune
in
my
pocket
,
I
put
no
small
value
*NL*
upon
myself
.
I
was
courted
by
several
very
considerable
tradesmen
,
and
*NL*
particularly
very
warmly
by
one
,
a
linen-draper
,
at
whose
house
,
after
*NL*
my
husband
's
death
,
I
took
a
lodging
,
his
sister
being
my
acquaintance
.
*NL*
Here
I
had
all
the
liberty
and
all
the
opportunity
to
be
gay
and
appear
*NL*
in
company
that
I
could
desire
,
my
landlord
's
sister
being
one
of
the
*NL*
maddest
,
gayest
things
alive
,
and
not
so
much
mistress
of
her
virtue
as
*NL*
I
thought
as
first
she
had
been
.
She
brought
me
into
a
world
of
wild
*NL*
company
,
and
even
brought
home
several
persons
,
such
as
she
liked
well
*NL*
enough
to
gratify
,
to
see
her
pretty
widow
,
so
she
was
pleased
to
call
*NL*
me
,
and
that
name
I
got
in
a
little
time
in
public
.
Now
,
as
fame
and
*NL*
fools
make
an
assembly
,
I
was
here
wonderfully
caressed
,
had
abundance
*NL*
of
admirers
,
and
such
as
called
themselves
lovers
;
but
I
found
not
one
*NL*
fair
proposal
among
them
all
.
As
for
their
common
design
,
that
I
*NL*
understood
too
well
to
be
drawn
into
any
more
snares
of
that
kind
.
The
*NL*
case
was
altered
with
me
:
I
had
money
in
my
pocket
,
and
had
nothing
to
*NL*
say
to
them
.
I
had
been
tricked
once
by
that
cheat
called
love
,
but
*NL*
the
game
was
over
;
I
was
resolved
now
to
be
married
or
nothing
,
and
to
*NL*
be
well
married
or
not
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
loved
the
company
,
indeed
,
of
men
of
mirth
and
wit
,
men
of
gallantry
*NL*
and
figure
,
and
was
often
entertained
with
such
,
as
I
was
also
with
*NL*
others
;
but
I
found
by
just
observation
,
that
the
brightest
men
came
*NL*
upon
the
dullest
errand
--
that
is
to
say
,
the
dullest
as
to
what
I
aimed
*NL*
at
.
On
the
other
hand
,
those
who
came
with
the
best
proposals
were
the
*NL*
dullest
and
most
disagreeable
part
of
the
world
.
I
was
not
averse
to
a
*NL*
tradesman
,
but
then
I
would
have
a
tradesman
,
forsooth
,
that
was
*NL*
something
of
a
gentleman
too
;
that
when
my
husband
had
a
mind
to
carry
*NL*
me
to
the
court
,
or
to
the
play
,
he
might
become
a
sword
,
and
look
as
*NL*
like
a
gentleman
as
another
man
;
and
not
be
one
that
had
the
mark
of
*NL*
his
apron-strings
upon
his
coat
,
or
the
mark
of
his
hat
upon
his
*NL*
periwig
;
that
should
look
as
if
he
was
set
on
to
his
sword
,
when
his
*NL*
sword
was
put
on
to
him
,
and
that
carried
his
trade
in
his
countenance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
at
last
I
found
this
amphibious
creature
,
this
land-water
thing
*NL*
called
a
gentleman-tradesman
;
and
as
a
just
plague
upon
my
folly
,
I
was
*NL*
catched
in
the
very
snare
which
,
as
I
might
say
,
I
laid
for
myself
.
I
*NL*
said
for
myself
,
for
I
was
not
trepanned
,
I
confess
,
but
I
betrayed
*NL*
myself
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
a
draper
,
too
,
for
though
my
comrade
would
have
brought
me
to
*NL*
a
bargain
with
her
brother
,
yet
when
it
came
to
the
point
,
it
was
,
it
*NL*
seems
,
for
a
mistress
,
not
a
wife
;
and
I
kept
true
to
this
notion
,
that
*NL*
a
woman
should
never
be
kept
for
a
mistress
that
had
money
to
keep
*NL*
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
my
pride
,
not
my
principle
,
my
money
,
not
my
virtue
,
kept
me
*NL*
honest
;
though
,
as
it
proved
,
I
found
I
had
much
better
have
been
sold
*NL*
by
my
she-comrade
to
her
brother
,
than
have
sold
myself
as
I
did
to
a
*NL*
tradesman
that
was
rake
,
gentleman
,
shopkeeper
,
and
beggar
,
all
*NL*
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
was
hurried
on
-LRB-
by
my
fancy
to
a
gentleman
-RRB-
to
ruin
myself
in
the
*NL*
grossest
manner
that
every
woman
did
;
for
my
new
husband
coming
to
a
*NL*
lump
of
money
at
once
,
fell
into
such
a
profusion
of
expense
,
that
all
*NL*
I
had
,
and
all
he
had
before
,
if
he
had
anything
worth
mentioning
,
*NL*
would
not
have
held
it
out
above
one
year
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
very
fond
of
me
for
about
a
quarter
of
a
year
,
and
what
I
got
by
*NL*
that
was
,
that
I
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
a
great
deal
of
my
money
*NL*
spent
upon
myself
,
and
,
as
I
may
say
,
had
some
of
the
spending
it
too
.
*NL*
`
Come
,
my
dear
,
'
says
he
to
me
one
day
,
`
shall
we
go
and
take
a
turn
*NL*
into
the
country
for
about
a
week
?
'
`
Ay
,
my
dear
,
'
says
I
,
`
whither
*NL*
would
you
go
?
'
'
I
care
not
whither
,
'
says
he
,
`
but
I
have
a
mind
to
*NL*
look
like
quality
for
a
week
.
We
'll
go
to
Oxford
,
'
says
he
.
`
How
,
'
*NL*
says
I
,
`
shall
we
go
?
I
am
no
horsewoman
,
and
't
is
too
far
for
a
*NL*
coach
.
'
`
Too
far
!
'
says
he
;
`
no
place
is
too
far
for
a
coach-and-six
.
*NL*
If
I
carry
you
out
,
you
shall
travel
like
a
duchess
.
'
`
Hum
,
'
says
I
,
*NL*
`
my
dear
,
't
is
a
frolic
;
but
if
you
have
a
mind
to
it
,
I
do
n't
care
.
'
*NL*
Well
,
the
time
was
appointed
,
we
had
a
rich
coach
,
very
good
horses
,
a
*NL*
coachman
,
postillion
,
and
two
footmen
in
very
good
liveries
;
a
*NL*
gentleman
on
horseback
,
and
a
page
with
a
feather
in
his
hat
upon
*NL*
another
horse
.
The
servants
all
called
him
my
lord
,
and
the
*NL*
inn-keepers
,
you
may
be
sure
,
did
the
like
,
and
I
was
her
honour
the
*NL*
Countess
,
and
thus
we
traveled
to
Oxford
,
and
a
very
pleasant
journey
*NL*
we
had
;
for
,
give
him
his
due
,
not
a
beggar
alive
knew
better
how
to
be
*NL*
a
lord
than
my
husband
.
We
saw
all
the
rarities
at
Oxford
,
talked
with
*NL*
two
or
three
Fellows
of
colleges
about
putting
out
a
young
nephew
,
that
*NL*
was
left
to
his
lordship
's
care
,
to
the
University
,
and
of
their
being
*NL*
his
tutors
.
We
diverted
ourselves
with
bantering
several
other
poor
*NL*
scholars
,
with
hopes
of
being
at
least
his
lordship
's
chaplains
and
*NL*
putting
on
a
scarf
;
and
thus
having
lived
like
quality
indeed
,
as
to
*NL*
expense
,
we
went
away
for
Northampton
,
and
,
in
a
word
,
in
about
twelve
*NL*
days
'
ramble
came
home
again
,
to
the
tune
of
about
#
93
expense
.
*NL*
*NL*
Vanity
is
the
perfection
of
a
fop
.
My
husband
had
this
excellence
,
*NL*
that
he
valued
nothing
of
expense
;
and
as
his
history
,
you
may
be
sure
,
*NL*
has
very
little
weight
in
it
,
't
is
enough
to
tell
you
that
in
about
two
*NL*
years
and
a
quarter
he
broke
,
and
was
not
so
happy
to
get
over
into
the
*NL*
Mint
,
but
got
into
a
sponging-house
,
being
arrested
in
an
action
too
*NL*
heavy
from
him
to
give
bail
to
,
so
he
sent
for
me
to
come
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
no
surprise
to
me
,
for
I
had
foreseen
some
time
that
all
was
*NL*
going
to
wreck
,
and
had
been
taking
care
to
reserve
something
if
I
*NL*
could
,
though
it
was
not
much
,
for
myself
.
But
when
he
sent
for
me
,
he
*NL*
behaved
much
better
than
I
expected
,
and
told
me
plainly
he
had
played
*NL*
the
fool
,
and
suffered
himself
to
be
surprised
,
which
he
might
have
*NL*
prevented
;
that
now
he
foresaw
he
could
not
stand
it
,
and
therefore
he
*NL*
would
have
me
go
home
,
and
in
the
night
take
away
everything
I
had
in
*NL*
the
house
of
any
value
,
and
secure
it
;
and
after
that
,
he
told
me
that
*NL*
if
I
could
get
away
one
hundred
or
two
hundred
pounds
in
goods
out
of
*NL*
the
shop
,
I
should
do
it
;
`
only
,
'
says
he
,
`
let
me
know
nothing
of
it
,
*NL*
neither
what
you
take
nor
whither
you
carry
it
;
for
as
for
me
,
'
says
*NL*
he
,
'
I
am
resolved
to
get
out
of
this
house
and
be
gone
;
and
if
you
*NL*
never
hear
of
me
more
,
my
dear
,
'
says
he
,
'
I
wish
you
well
;
I
am
only
*NL*
sorry
for
the
injury
I
have
done
you
.
'
He
said
some
very
handsome
*NL*
things
to
me
indeed
at
parting
;
for
I
told
you
he
was
a
gentleman
,
and
*NL*
that
was
all
the
benefit
I
had
of
his
being
so
;
that
he
used
me
very
*NL*
handsomely
and
with
good
manners
upon
all
occasions
,
even
to
the
last
,
*NL*
only
spent
all
I
had
,
and
left
me
to
rob
the
creditors
for
something
to
*NL*
subsist
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
I
did
as
he
bade
me
,
that
you
may
be
sure
;
and
having
thus
*NL*
taken
my
leave
of
him
,
I
never
saw
him
more
,
for
he
found
means
to
*NL*
break
out
of
the
bailiff
's
house
that
night
or
the
next
,
and
go
over
*NL*
into
France
,
and
for
the
rest
of
the
creditors
scrambled
for
it
as
well
*NL*
as
they
could
.
How
,
I
knew
not
,
for
I
could
come
at
no
knowledge
of
*NL*
anything
,
more
than
this
,
that
he
came
home
about
three
o'clock
in
the
*NL*
morning
,
caused
the
rest
of
his
goods
to
be
removed
into
the
Mint
,
and
*NL*
the
shop
to
be
shut
up
;
and
having
raised
what
money
he
could
get
*NL*
together
,
he
got
over
,
as
I
said
,
to
France
,
from
whence
I
had
one
or
*NL*
two
letters
from
him
,
and
no
more
.
I
did
not
see
him
when
he
came
*NL*
home
,
for
he
having
given
me
such
instructions
as
above
,
and
I
having
*NL*
made
the
best
of
my
time
,
I
had
no
more
business
back
again
at
the
*NL*
house
,
not
knowing
but
I
might
have
been
stopped
there
by
the
*NL*
creditors
;
for
a
commission
of
bankrupt
being
soon
after
issued
,
they
*NL*
might
have
stopped
me
by
orders
from
the
commissioners
.
But
my
*NL*
husband
,
having
so
dexterously
got
out
of
the
bailiff
's
house
by
*NL*
letting
himself
down
in
a
most
desperate
manner
from
almost
the
top
of
*NL*
the
house
to
the
top
of
another
building
,
and
leaping
from
thence
,
*NL*
which
was
almost
two
storeys
,
and
which
was
enough
indeed
to
have
*NL*
broken
his
neck
,
he
came
home
and
got
away
his
goods
before
the
*NL*
creditors
could
come
to
seize
;
that
is
to
say
,
before
they
could
get
*NL*
out
the
commission
,
and
be
ready
to
send
their
officers
to
take
*NL*
possession
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
husband
was
so
civil
to
me
,
for
still
I
say
he
was
much
of
a
*NL*
gentleman
,
that
in
the
first
letter
he
wrote
me
from
France
,
he
let
me
*NL*
know
where
he
had
pawned
twenty
pieces
of
fine
holland
for
#
30
,
which
*NL*
were
really
worth
#
90
,
and
enclosed
me
the
token
and
an
order
for
the
*NL*
taking
them
up
,
paying
the
money
,
which
I
did
,
and
made
in
time
above
*NL*
#
100
of
them
,
having
leisure
to
cut
them
and
sell
them
,
some
and
some
,
*NL*
to
private
families
,
as
opportunity
offered
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
with
all
this
,
and
all
that
I
had
secured
before
,
I
found
,
*NL*
upon
casting
things
up
,
my
case
was
very
much
altered
,
any
my
fortune
*NL*
much
lessened
;
for
,
including
the
hollands
and
a
parcel
of
fine
*NL*
muslins
,
which
I
carried
off
before
,
and
some
plate
,
and
other
things
,
*NL*
I
found
I
could
hardly
muster
up
#
500
;
and
my
condition
was
very
odd
,
*NL*
for
though
I
had
no
child
-LRB-
I
had
had
one
by
my
gentleman
draper
,
but
it
*NL*
was
buried
-RRB-
,
yet
I
was
a
widow
bewitched
;
I
had
a
husband
and
no
*NL*
husband
,
and
I
could
not
pretend
to
marry
again
,
though
I
knew
well
*NL*
enough
my
husband
would
never
see
England
any
more
,
if
he
lived
fifty
*NL*
years
.
Thus
,
I
say
,
I
was
limited
from
marriage
,
what
offer
might
*NL*
soever
be
made
me
;
and
I
had
not
one
friend
to
advise
with
in
the
*NL*
condition
I
was
in
,
least
not
one
I
durst
trust
the
secret
of
my
*NL*
circumstances
to
,
for
if
the
commissioners
were
to
have
been
informed
*NL*
where
I
was
,
I
should
have
been
fetched
up
and
examined
upon
oath
,
and
*NL*
all
I
have
saved
be
taken
away
from
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
Upon
these
apprehensions
,
the
first
thing
I
did
was
to
go
quite
out
of
*NL*
my
knowledge
,
and
go
by
another
name
.
This
I
did
effectually
,
for
I
*NL*
went
into
the
Mint
too
,
took
lodgings
in
a
very
private
place
,
dressed
*NL*
up
in
the
habit
of
a
widow
,
and
called
myself
Mrs.
Flanders
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
,
however
,
I
concealed
myself
,
and
though
my
new
acquaintances
knew
*NL*
nothing
of
me
,
yet
I
soon
got
a
great
deal
of
company
about
me
;
and
*NL*
whether
it
be
that
women
are
scarce
among
the
sorts
of
people
that
*NL*
generally
are
to
be
found
there
,
or
that
some
consolations
in
the
*NL*
miseries
of
the
place
are
more
requisite
than
on
other
occasions
,
I
*NL*
soon
found
an
agreeable
woman
was
exceedingly
valuable
among
the
sons
*NL*
of
affliction
there
,
and
that
those
that
wanted
money
to
pay
half
a
*NL*
crown
on
the
pound
to
their
creditors
,
and
that
run
in
debt
at
the
sign
*NL*
of
the
Bull
for
their
dinners
,
would
yet
find
money
for
a
supper
,
if
*NL*
they
liked
the
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
I
kept
myself
safe
yet
,
though
I
began
,
like
my
Lord
*NL*
Rochester
's
mistress
,
that
loved
his
company
,
but
would
not
admit
him
*NL*
farther
,
to
have
the
scandal
of
a
whore
,
without
the
joy
;
and
upon
this
*NL*
score
,
tired
with
the
place
,
and
indeed
with
the
company
too
,
I
began
*NL*
to
think
of
removing
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
indeed
a
subject
of
strange
reflection
to
me
to
see
men
who
were
*NL*
overwhelmed
in
perplexed
circumstances
,
who
were
reduced
some
degrees
*NL*
below
being
ruined
,
whose
families
were
objects
of
their
own
terror
and
*NL*
other
people
's
charity
,
yet
while
a
penny
lasted
,
nay
,
even
beyond
it
,
*NL*
endeavouring
to
drown
themselves
,
labouring
to
forget
former
things
,
*NL*
which
now
it
was
the
proper
time
to
remember
,
making
more
work
for
*NL*
repentance
,
and
sinning
on
,
as
a
remedy
for
sin
past
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
is
none
of
my
talent
to
preach
;
these
men
were
too
wicked
,
even
*NL*
for
me
.
There
was
something
horrid
and
absurd
in
their
way
of
sinning
,
*NL*
for
it
was
all
a
force
even
upon
themselves
;
they
did
not
only
act
*NL*
against
conscience
,
but
against
nature
;
they
put
a
rape
upon
their
*NL*
temper
to
drown
the
reflections
,
which
their
circumstances
continually
*NL*
gave
them
;
and
nothing
was
more
easy
than
to
see
how
sighs
would
*NL*
interrupt
their
songs
,
and
paleness
and
anguish
sit
upon
their
brows
,
*NL*
in
spite
of
the
forced
smiles
they
put
on
;
nay
,
sometimes
it
would
*NL*
break
out
at
their
very
mouths
when
they
had
parted
with
their
money
*NL*
for
a
lewd
treat
or
a
wicked
embrace
.
I
have
heard
them
,
turning
*NL*
about
,
fetch
a
deep
sigh
,
and
cry
,
`
What
a
dog
am
I
!
Well
,
Betty
,
my
*NL*
dear
,
I
'll
drink
thy
health
,
though
'
;
meaning
the
honest
wife
,
that
*NL*
perhaps
had
not
a
half-crown
for
herself
and
three
or
four
children
.
*NL*
The
next
morning
they
are
at
their
penitentials
again
;
and
perhaps
the
*NL*
poor
weeping
wife
comes
over
to
him
,
either
brings
him
some
account
of
*NL*
what
his
creditors
are
doing
,
and
how
she
and
the
children
are
turned
*NL*
out
of
doors
,
or
some
other
dreadful
news
;
and
this
adds
to
his
*NL*
self-reproaches
;
but
when
he
has
thought
and
pored
on
it
till
he
is
*NL*
almost
mad
,
having
no
principles
to
support
him
,
nothing
within
him
or
*NL*
above
him
to
comfort
him
,
but
finding
it
all
darkness
on
every
side
,
he
*NL*
flies
to
the
same
relief
again
,
viz
.
to
drink
it
away
,
debauch
it
away
,
*NL*
and
falling
into
company
of
men
in
just
the
same
condition
with
*NL*
himself
,
he
repeats
the
crime
,
and
thus
he
goes
every
day
one
step
*NL*
onward
of
his
way
to
destruction
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
not
wicked
enough
for
such
fellows
as
these
yet
.
On
the
*NL*
contrary
,
I
began
to
consider
here
very
seriously
what
I
had
to
do
;
how
*NL*
things
stood
with
me
,
and
what
course
I
ought
to
take
.
I
knew
I
had
no
*NL*
friends
,
no
,
not
one
friend
or
relation
in
the
world
;
and
that
little
I
*NL*
had
left
apparently
wasted
,
which
when
it
was
gone
,
I
saw
nothing
but
*NL*
misery
and
starving
was
before
me
.
Upon
these
considerations
,
I
say
,
*NL*
and
filled
with
horror
at
the
place
I
was
in
,
and
the
dreadful
objects
*NL*
which
I
had
always
before
me
,
I
resolved
to
be
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
made
an
acquaintance
with
a
very
sober
,
good
sort
of
a
woman
,
who
*NL*
was
a
widow
too
,
like
me
,
but
in
better
circumstances
.
Her
husband
had
*NL*
been
a
captain
of
a
merchant
ship
,
and
having
had
the
misfortune
to
be
*NL*
cast
away
coming
home
on
a
voyage
from
the
West
Indies
,
which
would
*NL*
have
been
very
profitable
if
he
had
come
safe
,
was
so
reduced
by
the
*NL*
loss
,
that
though
he
had
saved
his
life
then
,
it
broke
his
heart
,
and
*NL*
killed
him
afterwards
;
and
his
widow
,
being
pursued
by
the
creditors
,
*NL*
was
forced
to
take
shelter
in
the
Mint
.
She
soon
made
things
up
with
*NL*
the
help
of
friends
,
and
was
at
liberty
again
;
and
finding
that
I
*NL*
rather
was
there
to
be
concealed
,
than
by
any
particular
prosecutions
*NL*
and
finding
also
that
I
agreed
with
her
,
or
rather
she
with
me
,
in
a
*NL*
just
abhorrence
of
the
place
and
of
the
company
,
she
invited
to
go
home
*NL*
with
her
till
I
could
put
myself
in
some
posture
of
settling
in
the
*NL*
world
to
my
mind
;
withal
telling
me
,
that
it
was
ten
to
one
but
some
*NL*
good
captain
of
a
ship
might
take
a
fancy
to
me
,
and
court
me
,
in
that
*NL*
part
of
the
town
where
she
lived
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
accepted
her
offer
,
and
was
with
her
half
a
year
,
and
should
have
*NL*
been
longer
,
but
in
that
interval
what
she
proposed
to
me
happened
to
*NL*
herself
,
and
she
married
very
much
to
her
advantage
.
But
whose
fortune
*NL*
soever
was
upon
the
increase
,
mine
seemed
to
be
upon
the
wane
,
and
I
*NL*
found
nothing
present
,
except
two
or
three
boatswains
,
or
such
fellows
,
*NL*
but
as
for
the
commanders
,
they
were
generally
of
two
sorts
:
1
.
Such
*NL*
as
,
having
good
business
,
that
is
to
say
,
a
good
ship
,
resolved
not
to
*NL*
marry
but
with
advantage
,
that
is
,
with
a
good
fortune
;
2
.
Such
as
,
*NL*
being
out
of
employ
,
wanted
a
wife
to
help
them
to
a
ship
;
I
mean
-LRB-
1
-RRB-
a
*NL*
wife
who
,
having
some
money
,
could
enable
them
to
hold
,
as
they
call
*NL*
it
,
a
good
part
of
a
ship
themselves
,
so
to
encourage
owners
to
come
*NL*
in
;
or
-LRB-
2
-RRB-
a
wife
who
,
if
she
had
not
money
,
had
friends
who
were
*NL*
concerned
in
shipping
,
and
so
could
help
to
put
the
young
man
into
a
*NL*
good
ship
,
which
to
them
is
as
good
as
a
portion
;
and
neither
of
these
*NL*
was
my
case
,
so
I
looked
like
one
that
was
to
lie
on
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
knowledge
I
soon
learned
by
experience
,
viz
.
that
the
state
of
*NL*
things
was
altered
as
to
matrimony
,
and
that
I
was
not
to
expect
at
*NL*
London
what
I
had
found
in
the
country
:
that
marriages
were
here
the
*NL*
consequences
of
politic
schemes
for
forming
interests
,
and
carrying
on
*NL*
business
,
and
that
Love
had
no
share
,
or
but
very
little
,
in
the
matter
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
as
my
sister-in-law
at
Colchester
had
said
,
beauty
,
wit
,
manners
,
*NL*
sense
,
good
humour
,
good
behaviour
,
education
,
virtue
,
piety
,
or
any
*NL*
other
qualification
,
whether
of
body
or
mind
,
had
no
power
to
*NL*
recommend
;
that
money
only
made
a
woman
agreeable
;
that
men
chose
*NL*
mistresses
indeed
by
the
gust
of
their
affection
,
and
it
was
requisite
*NL*
to
a
whore
to
be
handsome
,
well-shaped
,
have
a
good
mien
and
a
graceful
*NL*
behaviour
;
but
that
for
a
wife
,
no
deformity
would
shock
the
fancy
,
no
*NL*
ill
qualities
the
judgment
;
the
money
was
the
thing
;
the
portion
was
*NL*
neither
crooked
nor
monstrous
,
but
the
money
was
always
agreeable
,
*NL*
whatever
the
wife
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
other
hand
,
as
the
market
ran
very
unhappily
on
the
men
's
side
,
*NL*
I
found
the
women
had
lost
the
privilege
of
saying
No
;
that
it
was
a
*NL*
favour
now
for
a
woman
to
have
the
Question
asked
,
and
if
any
young
*NL*
lady
had
so
much
arrogance
as
to
counterfeit
a
negative
,
she
never
had
*NL*
the
opportunity
given
her
of
denying
twice
,
much
less
of
recovering
*NL*
that
false
step
,
and
accepting
what
she
had
but
seemed
to
decline
.
The
*NL*
men
had
such
choice
everywhere
,
that
the
case
of
the
women
was
very
*NL*
unhappy
;
for
they
seemed
to
ply
at
every
door
,
and
if
the
man
was
by
*NL*
great
chance
refused
at
one
house
,
he
was
sure
to
be
received
at
the
*NL*
next
.
*NL*
*NL*
Besides
this
,
I
observed
that
the
men
made
no
scruple
to
set
themselves
*NL*
out
,
and
to
go
a-fortunehunting
,
as
they
call
it
,
when
they
had
really
*NL*
no
fortune
themselves
to
demand
it
,
or
merit
to
deserve
it
;
and
that
*NL*
they
carried
it
so
high
,
that
a
woman
was
scarce
allowed
to
inquire
*NL*
after
the
character
or
estate
of
the
person
that
pretended
to
her
.
*NL*
This
I
had
an
example
of
,
in
a
young
lady
in
the
next
house
to
me
,
and
*NL*
with
whom
I
had
contracted
an
intimacy
;
she
was
courted
by
a
young
*NL*
captain
,
and
though
she
had
near
#
2000
to
her
fortune
,
she
did
but
*NL*
inquire
of
some
of
his
neighbours
about
his
character
,
his
morals
,
or
*NL*
substance
,
and
he
took
occasion
at
the
next
visit
to
let
her
know
,
*NL*
truly
,
that
he
took
it
very
ill
,
and
that
he
should
not
give
her
the
*NL*
trouble
of
his
visits
any
more
.
I
heard
of
it
,
and
I
had
begun
my
*NL*
acquaintance
with
her
,
I
went
to
see
her
upon
it
.
She
entered
into
a
*NL*
close
conversation
with
me
about
it
,
and
unbosomed
herself
very
freely
.
*NL*
I
perceived
presently
that
though
she
thought
herself
very
ill
used
,
*NL*
yet
she
had
no
power
to
resent
it
,
and
was
exceedingly
piqued
that
she
*NL*
had
lost
him
,
and
particularly
that
another
of
less
fortune
had
gained
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
fortified
her
mind
against
such
a
meanness
,
as
I
called
it
;
I
told
*NL*
her
,
that
as
low
as
I
was
in
the
world
,
I
would
have
despised
a
man
*NL*
that
should
think
I
ought
to
take
him
upon
his
own
recommendation
only
,
*NL*
without
having
the
liberty
to
inform
myself
of
his
fortune
and
of
his
*NL*
character
;
also
I
told
her
,
that
as
she
had
a
good
fortune
,
she
had
no
*NL*
need
to
stoop
to
the
disaster
of
the
time
;
that
it
was
enough
that
the
*NL*
men
could
insult
us
that
had
but
little
money
to
recommend
us
,
but
if
*NL*
she
suffered
such
an
affront
to
pass
upon
her
without
resenting
it
,
she
*NL*
would
be
rendered
low-prized
upon
all
occasions
,
and
would
be
the
*NL*
contempt
of
all
the
women
in
that
part
of
the
town
;
that
a
woman
can
*NL*
never
want
an
opportunity
to
be
revenged
of
a
man
that
has
used
her
*NL*
ill
,
and
that
there
were
ways
enough
to
humble
such
a
fellow
as
that
,
*NL*
or
else
certainly
women
were
the
most
unhappy
creatures
in
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
found
she
was
very
well
pleased
with
the
discourse
,
and
she
told
me
*NL*
seriously
that
she
would
be
very
glad
to
make
him
sensible
of
her
just
*NL*
resentment
,
and
either
to
bring
him
on
again
,
or
have
the
satisfaction
*NL*
of
her
revenge
being
as
public
as
possible
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
told
her
,
that
if
she
would
take
my
advice
,
I
would
tell
her
how
she
*NL*
should
obtain
her
wishes
in
both
those
things
,
and
that
I
would
engage
*NL*
I
would
bring
the
man
to
her
door
again
,
and
make
him
beg
to
be
let
in
.
*NL*
She
smiled
at
that
,
and
soon
let
me
see
,
that
if
he
came
to
her
door
,
*NL*
her
resentment
was
not
so
great
as
to
give
her
leave
to
let
him
stand
*NL*
long
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
she
listened
very
willingly
to
my
offer
of
advice
;
so
I
told
*NL*
her
that
the
first
thing
she
ought
to
do
was
a
piece
of
justice
to
*NL*
herself
,
namely
,
that
whereas
she
had
been
told
by
several
people
that
*NL*
he
had
reported
among
the
ladies
that
he
had
left
her
,
and
pretended
to
*NL*
give
the
advantage
of
the
negative
to
himself
,
she
should
take
care
to
*NL*
have
it
well
spread
among
the
women
--
which
she
could
not
fail
of
an
*NL*
opportunity
to
do
in
a
neighbourhood
so
addicted
to
family
news
as
that
*NL*
she
live
in
was
--
that
she
had
inquired
into
his
circumstances
,
and
*NL*
found
he
was
not
the
man
as
to
estate
he
pretended
to
be
.
`
Let
them
be
*NL*
told
,
madam
,
'
said
I
,
`
that
you
had
been
well
informed
that
he
was
not
*NL*
the
man
that
you
expected
,
and
that
you
thought
it
was
not
safe
to
*NL*
meddle
with
him
;
that
you
heard
he
was
of
an
ill
temper
,
and
that
he
*NL*
boasted
how
he
had
used
the
women
ill
upon
many
occasions
,
and
that
*NL*
particularly
he
was
debauched
in
his
morals
'
,
etc.
.
The
last
of
which
,
*NL*
indeed
,
had
some
truth
in
it
;
but
at
the
same
time
I
did
not
find
that
*NL*
she
seemed
to
like
him
much
the
worse
for
that
part
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
had
put
this
into
her
head
,
she
came
most
readily
into
it
.
*NL*
Immediately
she
went
to
work
to
find
instruments
,
and
she
had
very
*NL*
little
difficulty
in
the
search
,
for
telling
her
story
in
general
to
a
*NL*
couple
of
gossips
in
the
neighbourhood
,
it
was
the
chat
of
the
*NL*
tea-table
all
over
that
part
of
the
town
,
and
I
met
with
it
wherever
I
*NL*
visited
;
also
,
as
it
was
known
that
I
was
acquainted
with
the
young
*NL*
lady
herself
,
my
opinion
was
asked
very
often
,
and
I
confirmed
it
with
*NL*
all
the
necessary
aggravations
,
and
set
out
his
character
in
the
*NL*
blackest
colours
;
but
then
as
a
piece
of
secret
intelligence
,
I
added
,
*NL*
as
what
the
other
gossips
knew
nothing
of
,
viz
.
that
I
had
heard
he
was
*NL*
in
very
bad
circumstances
;
that
he
was
under
a
necessity
of
a
fortune
*NL*
to
support
his
interest
with
the
owners
of
the
ship
he
commanded
;
that
*NL*
his
own
part
was
not
paid
for
,
and
if
it
was
not
paid
quickly
,
his
*NL*
owners
would
put
him
out
of
the
ship
,
and
his
chief
mate
was
likely
to
*NL*
command
it
,
who
offered
to
buy
that
part
which
the
captain
had
promised
*NL*
to
take
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
added
,
for
I
confess
I
was
heartily
piqued
at
the
rogue
,
as
I
called
*NL*
him
,
that
I
had
heard
a
rumour
,
too
,
that
he
had
a
wife
alive
at
*NL*
Plymouth
,
and
another
in
the
West
Indies
,
a
thing
which
they
all
knew
*NL*
was
not
very
uncommon
for
such
kind
of
gentlemen
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
worked
as
we
both
desire
it
,
for
presently
the
young
lady
next
*NL*
door
,
who
had
a
father
and
mother
that
governed
both
her
and
her
*NL*
fortune
,
was
shut
up
,
and
her
father
forbid
him
the
house
.
Also
in
one
*NL*
place
more
where
he
went
,
the
woman
had
the
courage
,
however
strange
it
*NL*
was
,
to
say
No
;
and
he
could
try
nowhere
but
he
was
reproached
with
his
*NL*
pride
,
and
that
he
pretended
not
to
give
the
women
leave
to
inquire
*NL*
into
his
character
,
and
the
like
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
by
this
time
he
began
to
be
sensible
of
his
mistake
;
and
having
*NL*
alarmed
all
the
women
on
that
side
of
the
water
,
he
went
over
to
*NL*
Ratcliff
,
and
got
access
to
some
of
the
ladies
there
;
but
though
the
*NL*
young
women
there
too
were
,
according
to
the
fate
of
the
day
,
pretty
*NL*
willing
to
be
asked
,
yet
such
was
his
ill-luck
,
that
his
character
*NL*
followed
him
over
the
water
and
his
good
name
was
much
the
same
there
*NL*
as
it
was
on
our
side
;
so
that
though
he
might
have
had
wives
enough
,
*NL*
yet
it
did
not
happen
among
the
women
that
had
good
fortunes
,
which
was
*NL*
what
he
wanted
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
this
was
not
all
;
she
very
ingeniously
managed
another
thing
*NL*
herself
,
for
she
got
a
young
gentleman
,
who
as
a
relation
,
and
was
*NL*
indeed
a
married
man
,
to
come
and
visit
her
two
or
three
times
a
week
*NL*
in
a
very
fine
chariot
and
good
liveries
,
and
her
two
agents
,
and
I
*NL*
also
,
presently
spread
a
report
all
over
,
that
this
gentleman
came
to
*NL*
court
her
;
that
he
was
a
gentleman
of
a
#
1000
a
year
,
and
that
he
was
*NL*
fallen
in
love
with
her
,
and
that
she
was
going
to
her
aunt
's
in
the
*NL*
city
,
because
it
was
inconvenient
for
the
gentleman
to
come
to
her
with
*NL*
his
coach
in
Redriff
,
the
streets
being
so
narrow
and
difficult
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
took
immediately
.
The
captain
was
laughed
at
in
all
companies
,
*NL*
and
was
ready
to
hang
himself
.
He
tried
all
the
ways
possible
to
come
*NL*
at
her
again
,
and
wrote
the
most
passionate
letters
to
her
in
the
*NL*
world
,
excusing
his
former
rashness
;
and
in
short
,
by
great
*NL*
application
,
obtained
leave
to
wait
on
her
again
,
as
he
said
,
to
clear
*NL*
his
reputation
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
meeting
she
had
her
full
revenge
of
him
;
for
she
told
him
she
*NL*
wondered
what
he
took
her
to
be
,
that
she
should
admit
any
man
to
a
*NL*
treaty
of
so
much
consequence
as
that
to
marriage
,
without
inquiring
*NL*
very
well
into
his
circumstances
;
that
if
he
thought
she
was
to
be
*NL*
huffed
into
wedlock
,
and
that
she
was
in
the
same
circumstances
which
*NL*
her
neighbours
might
be
in
,
viz
.
to
take
up
with
the
first
good
*NL*
Christian
that
came
,
he
was
mistaken
;
that
,
in
a
word
,
his
character
*NL*
was
really
bad
,
or
he
was
very
ill
beholden
to
his
neighbours
;
and
that
*NL*
unless
he
could
clear
up
some
points
,
in
which
she
had
justly
been
*NL*
prejudiced
,
she
had
no
more
to
say
to
him
,
but
to
do
herself
justice
,
*NL*
and
give
him
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
she
was
not
afraid
to
say
*NL*
No
,
either
to
him
or
any
man
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
that
she
told
him
what
she
had
heard
,
or
rather
raised
herself
by
*NL*
my
means
,
of
his
character
;
his
not
having
paid
for
the
part
he
*NL*
pretended
to
own
of
the
ship
he
commanded
;
of
the
resolution
of
his
*NL*
owners
to
put
him
out
of
the
command
,
and
to
put
his
mate
in
his
stead
;
*NL*
and
of
the
scandal
raised
on
his
morals
;
his
having
been
reproached
*NL*
with
such-and-such
women
,
and
having
a
wife
at
Plymouth
and
in
the
West
*NL*
Indies
,
and
the
like
;
and
she
asked
him
whether
he
could
deny
that
she
*NL*
had
good
reason
,
if
these
things
were
not
cleared
up
,
to
refuse
him
,
*NL*
and
in
the
meantime
to
insist
upon
having
satisfaction
in
points
to
*NL*
significant
as
they
were
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
so
confounded
at
her
discourse
that
he
could
not
answer
a
word
,
*NL*
and
she
almost
began
to
believe
that
all
was
true
,
by
his
disorder
,
*NL*
though
at
the
same
time
she
knew
that
she
had
been
the
raiser
of
all
*NL*
those
reports
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
some
time
he
recovered
himself
a
little
,
and
from
that
time
*NL*
became
the
most
humble
,
the
most
modest
,
and
most
importunate
man
alive
*NL*
in
his
courtship
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
carried
her
jest
on
a
great
way
.
She
asked
him
,
if
he
thought
she
*NL*
was
so
at
her
last
shift
that
she
could
or
ought
to
bear
such
*NL*
treatment
,
and
if
he
did
not
see
that
she
did
not
want
those
who
*NL*
thought
it
worth
their
while
to
come
farther
to
her
than
he
did
;
*NL*
meaning
the
gentleman
whom
she
had
brought
to
visit
her
by
way
of
sham
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
brought
him
by
these
tricks
to
submit
to
all
possible
measures
to
*NL*
satisfy
her
,
as
well
of
his
circumstances
as
of
his
behaviour
.
He
*NL*
brought
her
undeniable
evidence
of
his
having
paid
for
his
part
of
the
*NL*
ship
;
he
brought
her
certificates
from
his
owners
,
that
the
report
of
*NL*
their
intending
to
remove
him
from
the
command
of
the
ship
and
put
his
*NL*
chief
mate
in
was
false
and
groundless
;
in
short
,
he
was
quite
the
*NL*
reverse
of
what
he
was
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
I
convinced
her
,
that
if
the
men
made
their
advantage
of
our
sex
*NL*
in
the
affair
of
marriage
,
upon
the
supposition
of
there
being
such
*NL*
choice
to
be
had
,
and
of
the
women
being
so
easy
,
it
was
only
owing
to
*NL*
this
,
that
the
women
wanted
courage
to
maintain
their
ground
and
to
*NL*
play
their
part
;
and
that
,
according
to
my
Lord
Rochester
,
*NL*
*NL*
'
A
woman
's
ne'er
so
ruined
but
she
can
*NL*
Revenge
herself
on
her
undoer
,
Man
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
After
these
things
this
young
lady
played
her
part
so
well
,
that
though
*NL*
she
resolved
to
have
him
,
and
that
indeed
having
him
was
the
main
bent
*NL*
of
her
design
,
yet
she
made
his
obtaining
her
be
to
him
the
most
*NL*
difficult
thing
in
the
world
;
and
this
she
did
,
not
by
a
haughty
*NL*
reserved
carriage
,
but
by
a
just
policy
,
turning
the
tables
upon
him
,
*NL*
and
playing
back
upon
him
his
own
game
;
for
as
he
pretended
,
by
a
kind
*NL*
of
lofty
carriage
,
to
place
himself
above
the
occasion
of
a
character
,
*NL*
and
to
make
inquiring
into
his
character
a
kind
of
an
affront
to
him
,
*NL*
she
broke
with
him
upon
that
subject
,
and
at
the
same
time
that
she
*NL*
make
him
submit
to
all
possible
inquiry
after
his
affairs
,
she
*NL*
apparently
shut
the
door
against
his
looking
into
her
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
enough
to
him
to
obtain
her
for
a
wife
.
As
to
what
she
had
,
she
*NL*
told
him
plainly
,
that
as
he
knew
her
circumstances
,
it
was
but
just
*NL*
she
should
know
his
;
and
though
at
the
same
time
he
had
only
known
her
*NL*
circumstances
by
common
fame
,
yet
he
had
made
so
many
protestations
of
*NL*
his
passion
for
her
,
that
he
could
ask
no
more
but
her
hand
to
his
*NL*
grand
request
,
and
the
like
ramble
according
to
the
custom
of
lovers
.
*NL*
In
short
,
he
left
himself
no
room
to
ask
any
more
questions
about
her
*NL*
estate
,
and
she
took
the
advantage
of
it
like
a
prudent
woman
,
for
she
*NL*
placed
part
of
her
fortune
so
in
trustees
,
without
letting
him
know
*NL*
anything
of
it
,
that
it
was
quite
out
of
his
reach
,
and
made
him
be
*NL*
very
well
content
with
the
rest
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
true
she
was
pretty
well
besides
,
that
is
to
say
,
she
had
about
*NL*
#
1400
in
money
,
which
she
gave
him
;
and
the
other
,
after
some
time
,
she
*NL*
brought
to
light
as
a
perquisite
to
herself
,
which
he
was
to
accept
as
*NL*
a
mighty
favour
,
seeing
though
it
was
not
to
be
his
,
it
might
ease
him
*NL*
in
the
article
of
her
particular
expenses
;
and
I
must
add
,
that
by
this
*NL*
conduct
the
gentleman
himself
became
not
only
the
more
humble
in
his
*NL*
applications
to
her
to
obtain
her
,
but
also
was
much
the
more
an
*NL*
obliging
husband
to
her
when
he
had
her
.
I
can
not
but
remind
the
*NL*
ladies
here
how
much
they
place
themselves
below
the
common
station
of
*NL*
a
wife
,
which
,
if
I
may
be
allowed
not
to
be
partial
,
is
low
enough
*NL*
already
;
I
say
,
they
place
themselves
below
their
common
station
,
and
*NL*
prepare
their
own
mortifications
,
by
their
submitting
so
to
be
insulted
*NL*
by
the
men
beforehand
,
which
I
confess
I
see
no
necessity
of
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
relation
may
serve
,
therefore
,
to
let
the
ladies
see
that
the
*NL*
advantage
is
not
so
much
on
the
other
side
as
the
men
think
it
is
;
and
*NL*
though
it
may
be
true
that
the
men
have
but
too
much
choice
among
us
,
*NL*
and
that
some
women
may
be
found
who
will
dishonour
themselves
,
be
*NL*
cheap
,
and
easy
to
come
at
,
and
will
scarce
wait
to
be
asked
,
yet
if
*NL*
they
will
have
women
,
as
I
may
say
,
worth
having
,
they
may
find
them
as
*NL*
uncomeatable
as
ever
and
that
those
that
are
otherwise
are
a
sort
of
*NL*
people
that
have
such
deficiencies
,
when
had
,
as
rather
recommend
the
*NL*
ladies
that
are
difficult
than
encourage
the
men
to
go
on
with
their
*NL*
easy
courtship
,
and
expect
wives
equally
valuable
that
will
come
at
*NL*
first
call
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
is
more
certain
than
that
the
ladies
always
gain
of
the
men
by
*NL*
keeping
their
ground
,
and
letting
their
pretended
lovers
see
they
can
*NL*
resent
being
slighted
,
and
that
they
are
not
afraid
of
saying
No
.
*NL*
They
,
I
observe
,
insult
us
mightily
with
telling
us
of
the
number
of
*NL*
women
;
that
the
wars
,
and
the
sea
,
and
trade
,
and
other
incidents
have
*NL*
carried
the
men
so
much
away
,
that
there
is
no
proportion
between
the
*NL*
numbers
of
the
sexes
,
and
therefore
the
women
have
the
disadvantage
;
*NL*
but
I
am
far
from
granting
that
the
number
of
women
is
so
great
,
or
the
*NL*
number
of
men
so
small
;
but
if
they
will
have
me
tell
the
truth
,
the
*NL*
disadvantage
of
the
women
is
a
terrible
scandal
upon
the
men
,
and
it
*NL*
lies
here
,
and
here
only
;
namely
,
that
the
age
is
so
wicked
,
and
the
*NL*
sex
so
debauched
,
that
,
in
short
,
the
number
of
such
men
as
an
honest
*NL*
woman
ought
to
meddle
with
is
small
indeed
,
and
it
is
but
here
and
*NL*
there
that
a
man
is
to
be
found
who
is
fit
for
a
woman
to
venture
upon
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
consequence
even
of
that
too
amounts
to
no
more
than
this
,
that
*NL*
women
ought
to
be
the
more
nice
;
for
how
do
we
know
the
just
character
*NL*
of
the
man
that
makes
the
offer
?
To
say
that
the
woman
should
be
the
*NL*
more
easy
on
this
occasion
,
is
to
say
we
should
be
the
forwarder
to
*NL*
venture
because
of
the
greatness
of
the
danger
,
which
,
in
my
way
of
*NL*
reasoning
,
is
very
absurd
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
contrary
,
the
women
have
ten
thousand
times
the
more
reason
to
*NL*
be
wary
and
backward
,
by
how
much
the
hazard
of
being
betrayed
is
the
*NL*
greater
;
and
would
the
ladies
consider
this
,
and
act
the
wary
part
,
*NL*
they
would
discover
every
cheat
that
offered
;
for
,
in
short
,
the
lives
*NL*
of
very
few
men
nowadays
will
bear
a
character
;
and
if
the
ladies
do
*NL*
but
make
a
little
inquiry
,
they
will
soon
be
able
to
distinguish
the
*NL*
men
and
deliver
themselves
.
As
for
women
that
do
not
think
their
own
*NL*
safety
worth
their
thought
,
that
,
impatient
of
their
perfect
state
,
*NL*
resolve
,
as
they
call
it
,
to
take
the
first
good
Christian
that
comes
,
*NL*
that
run
into
matrimony
as
a
horse
rushes
into
the
battle
,
I
can
say
*NL*
nothing
to
them
but
this
,
that
they
are
a
sort
of
ladies
that
are
to
be
*NL*
prayed
for
among
the
rest
of
distempered
people
,
and
to
me
they
look
*NL*
like
people
that
venture
their
whole
estates
in
a
lottery
where
there
*NL*
is
a
hundred
thousand
blanks
to
one
prize
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
man
of
common-sense
will
value
a
woman
the
less
for
not
giving
up
*NL*
herself
at
the
first
attack
,
or
for
accepting
his
proposal
without
*NL*
inquiring
into
his
person
or
character
;
on
the
contrary
,
he
must
think
*NL*
her
the
weakest
of
all
creatures
in
the
world
,
as
the
rate
of
men
now
*NL*
goes
.
In
short
,
he
must
have
a
very
contemptible
opinion
of
her
*NL*
capacities
,
nay
,
every
of
her
understanding
,
that
,
having
but
one
case
*NL*
of
her
life
,
shall
call
that
life
away
at
once
,
and
make
matrimony
,
*NL*
like
death
,
be
a
leap
in
the
dark
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
would
fain
have
the
conduct
of
my
sex
a
little
regulated
in
this
*NL*
particular
,
which
is
the
thing
in
which
,
of
all
the
parts
of
life
,
I
*NL*
think
at
this
time
we
suffer
most
in
;
't
is
nothing
but
lack
of
courage
,
*NL*
the
fear
of
not
being
married
at
all
,
and
of
that
frightful
state
of
*NL*
life
called
an
old
maid
,
of
which
I
have
a
story
to
tell
by
itself
.
*NL*
This
,
I
say
,
is
the
woman
's
snare
;
but
would
the
ladies
once
but
get
*NL*
above
that
fear
and
manage
rightly
,
they
would
more
certainly
avoid
it
*NL*
by
standing
their
ground
,
in
a
case
so
absolutely
necessary
to
their
*NL*
felicity
,
that
by
exposing
themselves
as
they
do
;
and
if
they
did
not
*NL*
marry
so
soon
as
they
may
do
otherwise
,
they
would
make
themselves
*NL*
amends
by
marrying
safer
.
She
is
always
married
too
soon
who
gets
a
*NL*
bad
husband
,
and
she
is
never
married
too
late
who
gets
a
good
one
;
in
*NL*
a
word
,
there
is
no
woman
,
deformity
or
lost
reputation
excepted
,
but
*NL*
if
she
manages
well
,
may
be
married
safely
one
time
or
other
;
but
if
*NL*
she
precipitates
herself
,
it
is
ten
thousand
to
one
but
she
is
undone
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
come
now
to
my
own
case
,
in
which
there
was
at
this
time
no
*NL*
little
nicety
.
The
circumstances
I
was
in
made
the
offer
of
a
good
*NL*
husband
the
most
necessary
thing
in
the
world
to
me
,
but
I
found
soon
*NL*
that
to
be
made
cheap
and
easy
was
not
the
way
.
It
soon
began
to
be
*NL*
found
that
the
widow
had
no
fortune
,
and
to
say
this
was
to
say
all
*NL*
that
was
ill
of
me
,
for
I
began
to
be
dropped
in
all
the
discourses
of
*NL*
matrimony
.
Being
well-bred
,
handsome
,
witty
,
modest
,
and
agreeable
;
*NL*
all
which
I
had
allowed
to
my
character
--
whether
justly
or
no
is
not
*NL*
the
purpose
--
I
say
,
all
these
would
not
do
without
the
dross
,
which
way
*NL*
now
become
more
valuable
than
virtue
itself
.
In
short
,
the
widow
,
they
*NL*
said
,
had
no
money
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
resolved
,
therefore
,
as
to
the
state
of
my
present
circumstances
,
*NL*
that
it
was
absolutely
necessary
to
change
my
station
,
and
make
a
new
*NL*
appearance
in
some
other
place
where
I
was
not
known
,
and
even
to
pass
*NL*
by
another
name
if
I
found
occasion
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
communicated
my
thoughts
to
my
intimate
friend
,
the
captain
's
lady
,
*NL*
whom
I
had
so
faithfully
served
in
her
case
with
the
captain
,
and
who
*NL*
was
as
ready
to
serve
me
in
the
same
kind
as
I
could
desire
.
I
made
no
*NL*
scruple
to
lay
my
circumstances
open
to
her
;
my
stock
was
but
low
,
for
*NL*
I
had
made
but
about
#
540
at
the
close
of
my
last
affair
,
and
I
had
*NL*
wasted
some
of
that
;
however
,
I
had
about
#
460
left
,
a
great
many
very
*NL*
rich
clothes
,
a
gold
watch
,
and
some
jewels
,
though
of
no
extraordinary
*NL*
value
,
and
about
#
30
or
#
40
left
in
linen
not
disposed
of
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
dear
and
faithful
friend
,
the
captain
's
wife
,
was
so
sensible
of
the
*NL*
service
I
had
done
her
in
the
affair
above
,
that
she
was
not
only
a
*NL*
steady
friend
to
me
,
but
,
knowing
my
circumstances
,
she
frequently
made
*NL*
me
presents
as
money
came
into
her
hands
,
such
as
fully
amounted
to
a
*NL*
maintenance
,
so
that
I
spent
none
of
my
own
;
and
at
last
she
made
this
*NL*
unhappy
proposal
to
me
,
viz
.
that
as
we
had
observed
,
as
above
,
how
the
*NL*
men
made
no
scruple
to
set
themselves
out
as
persons
meriting
a
woman
*NL*
of
fortune
,
when
they
had
really
no
fortune
of
their
own
,
it
was
but
*NL*
just
to
deal
with
them
in
their
own
way
and
,
if
it
was
possible
,
to
*NL*
deceive
the
deceiver
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
captain
's
lady
,
in
short
,
put
this
project
into
my
head
,
and
told
*NL*
me
if
I
would
be
ruled
by
her
I
should
certainly
get
a
husband
of
*NL*
fortune
,
without
leaving
him
any
room
to
reproach
me
with
want
of
my
*NL*
own
.
I
told
her
,
as
I
had
reason
to
do
,
that
I
would
give
up
myself
*NL*
wholly
to
her
directions
,
and
that
I
would
have
neither
tongue
to
speak
*NL*
nor
feet
to
step
in
that
affair
but
as
she
should
direct
me
,
depending
*NL*
that
she
would
extricate
me
out
of
every
difficulty
she
brought
me
*NL*
into
,
which
she
said
she
would
answer
for
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
step
she
put
me
upon
was
to
call
her
cousin
,
and
to
to
a
*NL*
relation
's
house
of
hers
in
the
country
,
where
she
directed
me
,
and
*NL*
where
she
brought
her
husband
to
visit
me
;
and
calling
me
cousin
,
she
*NL*
worked
matters
so
about
,
that
her
husband
and
she
together
invited
me
*NL*
most
passionately
to
come
to
town
and
be
with
them
,
for
they
now
live
*NL*
in
a
quite
different
place
from
where
they
were
before
.
In
the
next
*NL*
place
,
she
tells
her
husband
that
I
had
at
least
#
1500
fortune
,
and
*NL*
that
after
some
of
my
relations
I
was
like
to
have
a
great
deal
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
enough
to
tell
her
husband
this
;
there
needed
nothing
on
my
*NL*
side
.
I
was
but
to
sit
still
and
wait
the
event
,
for
it
presently
went
*NL*
all
over
the
neighbourhood
that
the
young
widow
at
Captain
--
's
was
a
*NL*
fortune
,
that
she
had
at
least
#
1500
,
and
perhaps
a
great
deal
more
,
*NL*
and
that
the
captain
said
so
;
and
if
the
captain
was
asked
at
any
time
*NL*
about
me
,
he
made
no
scruple
to
affirm
it
,
though
he
knew
not
one
word
*NL*
of
the
matter
,
other
than
that
his
wife
had
told
him
so
;
and
in
this
*NL*
he
thought
no
harm
,
for
he
really
believed
it
to
be
so
,
because
he
had
*NL*
it
from
his
wife
:
so
slender
a
foundation
will
those
fellows
build
*NL*
upon
,
if
they
do
but
think
there
is
a
fortune
in
the
game
.
With
the
*NL*
reputation
of
this
fortune
,
I
presently
found
myself
blessed
with
*NL*
admirers
enough
,
and
that
I
had
my
choice
of
men
,
as
scarce
as
they
*NL*
said
they
were
,
which
,
by
the
way
,
confirms
what
I
was
saying
before
.
*NL*
This
being
my
case
,
I
,
who
had
a
subtle
game
to
play
,
had
nothing
now
*NL*
to
do
but
to
single
out
from
them
all
the
properest
man
that
might
be
*NL*
for
my
purpose
;
that
is
to
say
,
the
man
who
was
most
likely
to
depend
*NL*
upon
the
hearsay
of
a
fortune
,
and
not
inquire
too
far
into
the
*NL*
particulars
;
and
unless
I
did
this
I
did
nothing
,
for
my
case
would
not
*NL*
bear
much
inquiry
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
picked
out
my
man
without
much
difficulty
,
by
the
judgment
I
made
of
*NL*
his
way
of
courting
me
.
I
had
let
him
run
on
with
his
protestations
*NL*
and
oaths
that
he
loved
me
above
all
the
world
;
that
if
I
would
make
*NL*
him
happy
,
that
was
enough
;
all
which
I
knew
was
upon
supposition
,
nay
,
*NL*
it
was
upon
a
full
satisfaction
,
that
I
was
very
rich
,
though
I
never
*NL*
told
him
a
word
of
it
myself
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
my
man
;
but
I
was
to
try
him
to
the
bottom
,
and
indeed
in
that
*NL*
consisted
my
safety
;
for
if
he
baulked
,
I
knew
I
was
undone
,
as
surely
*NL*
as
he
was
undone
if
he
took
me
;
and
if
I
did
not
make
some
scruple
*NL*
about
his
fortune
,
it
was
the
way
to
lead
him
to
raise
some
about
mine
;
*NL*
and
first
,
therefore
,
I
pretended
on
all
occasions
to
doubt
his
*NL*
sincerity
,
and
told
him
,
perhaps
he
only
courted
me
for
my
fortune
.
He
*NL*
stopped
my
mouth
in
that
part
with
the
thunder
of
his
protestations
,
as
*NL*
above
,
but
still
I
pretended
to
doubt
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
morning
he
pulls
off
his
diamond
ring
,
and
writes
upon
the
glass
of
*NL*
the
sash
in
my
chamber
this
line
--
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
I
love
,
and
you
alone
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
read
it
,
and
asked
him
to
lend
me
his
ring
,
with
which
I
wrote
under
*NL*
it
,
thus
--
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
so
in
love
says
every
one
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
takes
his
ring
again
,
and
writes
another
line
thus
--
*NL*
*NL*
`
Virtue
alone
is
an
estate
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
borrowed
it
again
,
and
I
wrote
under
it
--
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
money
's
virtue
,
gold
is
fate
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
coloured
as
red
as
fire
to
see
me
turn
so
quick
upon
him
,
and
in
a
*NL*
kind
of
a
rage
told
me
he
would
conquer
me
,
and
writes
again
thus
--
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
scorn
your
gold
,
and
yet
I
love
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
ventured
all
upon
the
last
cast
of
poetry
,
as
you
'll
see
,
for
I
wrote
*NL*
boldly
under
his
last
--
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
'm
poor
:
let
's
see
how
kind
you
'll
prove
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
a
sad
truth
to
me
;
whether
he
believed
me
or
no
,
I
could
not
*NL*
tell
;
I
supposed
then
that
he
did
not
.
However
,
he
flew
to
me
,
took
me
*NL*
in
his
arms
,
and
,
kissing
me
very
eagerly
,
and
with
the
greatest
*NL*
passion
imaginable
,
he
held
me
fast
till
he
called
for
a
pen
and
ink
,
*NL*
and
then
told
me
he
could
not
wait
the
tedious
writing
on
the
glass
,
*NL*
but
,
pulling
out
a
piece
of
paper
,
he
began
and
wrote
again
--
*NL*
*NL*
`
Be
mine
,
with
all
your
poverty
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
took
his
pen
,
and
followed
him
immediately
,
thus
--
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yet
secretly
you
hope
I
lie
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
told
me
that
was
unkind
,
because
it
was
not
just
,
and
that
I
put
him
*NL*
upon
contradicting
me
,
which
did
not
consist
with
good
manners
,
any
*NL*
more
than
with
his
affection
;
and
therefore
,
since
I
had
insensibly
*NL*
drawn
him
into
this
poetical
scribble
,
he
begged
I
would
not
oblige
him
*NL*
to
break
it
off
;
so
he
writes
again
--
*NL*
*NL*
`
Let
love
alone
be
our
debate
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
wrote
again
--
*NL*
*NL*
`
She
loves
enough
that
does
not
hate
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
This
he
took
for
a
favour
,
and
so
laid
down
the
cudgels
,
that
is
to
*NL*
say
,
the
pen
;
I
say
,
he
took
if
for
a
favour
,
and
a
mighty
one
it
was
,
*NL*
if
he
had
known
all
.
However
,
he
took
it
as
I
meant
it
,
that
is
,
to
*NL*
let
him
think
I
was
inclined
to
go
on
with
him
,
as
indeed
I
had
all
the
*NL*
reason
in
the
world
to
do
,
for
he
was
the
best-humoured
,
merry
sort
of
*NL*
a
fellow
that
I
ever
met
with
,
and
I
often
reflected
on
myself
how
*NL*
doubly
criminal
it
was
to
deceive
such
a
man
;
but
that
necessity
,
which
*NL*
pressed
me
to
a
settlement
suitable
to
my
condition
,
was
my
authority
*NL*
for
it
;
and
certainly
his
affection
to
me
,
and
the
goodness
of
his
*NL*
temper
,
however
they
might
argue
against
using
him
ill
,
yet
they
*NL*
strongly
argued
to
me
that
he
would
better
take
the
disappointment
than
*NL*
some
fiery-tempered
wretch
,
who
might
have
nothing
to
recommend
him
but
*NL*
those
passions
which
would
serve
only
to
make
a
woman
miserable
all
her
*NL*
days
.
*NL*
*NL*
Besides
,
though
I
jested
with
him
-LRB-
as
he
supposed
it
-RRB-
so
often
about
my
*NL*
poverty
,
yet
,
when
he
found
it
to
be
true
,
he
had
foreclosed
all
manner
*NL*
of
objection
,
seeing
,
whether
he
was
in
jest
or
in
earnest
,
he
had
*NL*
declared
he
took
me
without
any
regard
to
my
portion
,
and
,
whether
I
*NL*
was
in
jest
or
in
earnest
,
I
had
declared
myself
to
be
very
poor
;
so
*NL*
that
,
in
a
word
,
I
had
him
fast
both
ways
;
and
though
he
might
say
*NL*
afterwards
he
was
cheated
,
yet
he
could
never
say
that
I
had
cheated
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
pursued
me
close
after
this
,
and
as
I
saw
there
was
no
need
to
fear
*NL*
losing
him
,
I
played
the
indifferent
part
with
him
longer
than
prudence
*NL*
might
otherwise
have
dictated
to
me
.
But
I
considered
how
much
this
*NL*
caution
and
indifference
would
give
me
the
advantage
over
him
,
when
I
*NL*
should
come
to
be
under
the
necessity
of
owning
my
own
circumstances
to
*NL*
him
;
and
I
managed
it
the
more
warily
,
because
I
found
he
inferred
from
*NL*
thence
,
as
indeed
he
ought
to
do
,
that
I
either
had
the
more
money
or
*NL*
the
more
judgment
,
and
would
not
venture
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
took
the
freedom
one
day
,
after
we
had
talked
pretty
close
to
the
*NL*
subject
,
to
tell
him
that
it
was
true
I
had
received
the
compliment
of
*NL*
a
lover
from
him
,
namely
,
that
he
would
take
me
without
inquiring
into
*NL*
my
fortune
,
and
I
would
make
him
a
suitable
return
in
this
,
viz
.
that
I
*NL*
would
make
as
little
inquiry
into
his
as
consisted
with
reason
,
but
I
*NL*
hoped
he
would
allow
me
to
ask
a
few
questions
,
which
he
would
answer
*NL*
or
not
as
he
thought
fit
;
and
that
I
would
not
be
offended
if
he
did
*NL*
not
answer
me
at
all
;
one
of
these
questions
related
to
our
manner
of
*NL*
living
,
and
the
place
where
,
because
I
had
heard
he
had
a
great
*NL*
plantation
in
Virginia
,
and
that
he
had
talked
of
going
to
live
there
,
*NL*
and
I
told
him
I
did
not
care
to
be
transported
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
began
from
this
discourse
to
let
me
voluntarily
into
all
his
*NL*
affairs
,
and
to
tell
me
in
a
frank
,
open
way
all
his
circumstances
,
by
*NL*
which
I
found
he
was
very
well
to
pass
in
the
world
;
but
that
great
*NL*
part
of
his
estate
consisted
of
three
plantations
,
which
he
had
in
*NL*
Virginia
,
which
brought
him
in
a
very
good
income
,
generally
speaking
,
*NL*
to
the
tune
of
#
300
,
a
year
,
but
that
if
he
was
to
live
upon
them
,
*NL*
would
bring
him
in
four
times
as
much
.
`
Very
well
,
'
thought
I
;
`
you
*NL*
shall
carry
me
thither
as
soon
as
you
please
,
though
I
wo
n't
tell
you
*NL*
so
beforehand
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
jested
with
him
extremely
about
the
figure
he
would
make
in
Virginia
;
*NL*
but
I
found
he
would
do
anything
I
desired
,
though
he
did
not
seem
glad
*NL*
to
have
me
undervalue
his
plantations
,
so
I
turned
my
tale
.
I
told
him
*NL*
I
had
good
reason
not
to
go
there
to
live
,
because
if
his
plantations
*NL*
were
worth
so
much
there
,
I
had
not
a
fortune
suitable
to
a
gentleman
*NL*
of
#
1200
a
year
,
as
he
said
his
estate
would
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
replied
generously
,
he
did
not
ask
what
my
fortune
was
;
he
had
told
*NL*
me
from
the
beginning
he
would
not
,
and
he
would
be
as
good
as
his
*NL*
word
;
but
whatever
it
was
,
he
assured
me
he
would
never
desire
me
to
go
*NL*
to
Virginia
with
him
,
or
go
thither
himself
without
me
,
unless
I
was
*NL*
perfectly
willing
,
and
made
it
my
choice
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
,
you
may
be
sure
,
was
as
I
wished
,
and
indeed
nothing
could
*NL*
have
happened
more
perfectly
agreeable
.
I
carried
it
on
as
far
as
this
*NL*
with
a
sort
of
indifferency
that
he
often
wondered
at
,
more
than
at
*NL*
first
,
but
which
was
the
only
support
of
his
courtship
;
and
I
mention
*NL*
it
the
rather
to
intimate
again
to
the
ladies
that
nothing
but
want
of
*NL*
courage
for
such
an
indifferency
makes
our
sex
so
cheap
,
and
prepares
*NL*
them
to
be
ill-used
as
they
are
;
would
they
venture
the
loss
of
a
*NL*
pretending
fop
now
and
then
,
who
carries
it
high
upon
the
point
of
his
*NL*
own
merit
,
they
would
certainly
be
less
slighted
,
and
courted
more
.
*NL*
Had
I
discovered
really
and
truly
what
my
great
fortune
was
,
and
that
*NL*
in
all
I
had
not
full
#
500
when
he
expected
#
1500
,
yet
I
had
hooked
him
*NL*
so
fast
,
and
played
him
so
long
,
that
I
was
satisfied
he
would
have
had
*NL*
me
in
my
worst
circumstances
;
and
indeed
it
was
less
a
surprise
to
him
*NL*
when
he
learned
the
truth
than
it
would
have
been
,
because
having
not
*NL*
the
least
blame
to
lay
on
me
,
who
had
carried
it
with
an
air
of
*NL*
indifference
to
the
last
,
he
would
not
say
one
word
,
except
that
indeed
*NL*
he
thought
it
had
been
more
,
but
that
if
it
had
been
less
he
did
not
*NL*
repent
his
bargain
;
only
that
he
should
not
be
able
to
maintain
me
so
*NL*
well
as
he
intended
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
short
,
we
were
married
,
and
very
happily
married
on
my
side
,
I
*NL*
assure
you
,
as
to
the
man
;
for
he
was
the
best-humoured
man
that
every
*NL*
woman
had
,
but
his
circumstances
were
not
so
good
as
I
imagined
,
as
,
on
*NL*
the
other
hand
,
he
had
not
bettered
himself
by
marrying
so
much
as
he
*NL*
expected
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
were
married
,
I
was
shrewdly
put
to
it
to
bring
him
that
little
*NL*
stock
I
had
,
and
to
let
him
see
it
was
no
more
;
but
there
was
a
*NL*
necessity
for
it
,
so
I
took
my
opportunity
one
day
when
we
were
alone
,
*NL*
to
enter
into
a
short
dialogue
with
him
about
it
.
`
My
dear
,
'
said
I
,
*NL*
`
we
have
been
married
a
fortnight
;
is
it
not
time
to
let
you
know
*NL*
whether
you
have
got
a
wife
with
something
or
with
nothing
?
'
`
Your
own
*NL*
time
for
that
,
my
dear
,
'
says
he
;
'
I
am
satisfied
that
I
have
got
the
*NL*
wife
I
love
;
I
have
not
troubled
you
much
,
'
says
he
,
`
with
my
inquiry
*NL*
after
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
's
true
,
'
says
I
,
`
but
I
have
a
great
difficulty
upon
me
about
it
,
*NL*
which
I
scarce
know
how
to
manage
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
's
that
,
m
'
dear
?
'
says
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
'
says
I
,
''
tis
a
little
hard
upon
me
,
and
't
is
harder
upon
you
.
*NL*
I
am
told
that
Captain
--
'
-LRB-
meaning
my
friend
's
husband
-RRB-
`
has
told
*NL*
you
I
had
a
great
deal
more
money
than
I
ever
pretended
to
have
,
and
I
*NL*
am
sure
I
never
employed
him
to
do
so
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
'
says
he
,
`
Captain
--
may
have
told
me
so
,
but
what
then
?
If
*NL*
you
have
not
so
much
,
that
may
lie
at
his
door
,
but
you
never
told
me
*NL*
what
you
had
,
so
I
have
no
reason
to
blame
you
if
you
have
nothing
at
*NL*
all
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
's
is
so
just
,
'
said
I
,
`
and
so
generous
,
that
it
makes
my
having
*NL*
but
a
little
a
double
affliction
to
me
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
less
you
have
,
my
dear
,
'
says
he
,
`
the
worse
for
us
both
;
but
I
*NL*
hope
your
affliction
you
speak
of
is
not
caused
for
fear
I
should
be
*NL*
unkind
to
you
,
for
want
of
a
portion
.
No
,
no
,
if
you
have
nothing
,
*NL*
tell
me
plainly
,
and
at
once
;
I
may
perhaps
tell
the
captain
he
has
*NL*
cheated
me
,
but
I
can
never
say
you
have
cheated
me
,
for
did
you
not
*NL*
give
it
under
your
hand
that
you
were
poor
?
and
so
I
ought
to
expect
*NL*
you
to
be
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
'
said
I
,
`
my
dear
,
I
am
glad
I
have
not
been
concerned
in
*NL*
deceiving
you
before
marriage
.
If
I
deceive
you
since
,
't
is
ne'er
the
*NL*
worse
;
that
I
am
poor
is
too
true
,
but
not
so
poor
as
to
have
nothing
*NL*
neither
'
;
so
I
pulled
out
some
bank
bills
,
and
gave
him
about
#
160
.
*NL*
`
There
's
something
,
my
dear
,
'
said
I
,
`
and
not
quite
all
neither
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
brought
him
so
near
to
expecting
nothing
,
by
what
I
had
said
*NL*
before
,
that
the
money
,
though
the
sum
was
small
in
itself
,
was
doubly
*NL*
welcome
to
him
;
he
owned
it
was
more
than
he
looked
for
,
and
that
he
*NL*
did
not
question
by
my
discourse
to
him
,
but
that
my
fine
clothes
,
gold
*NL*
watch
,
and
a
diamond
ring
or
two
,
had
been
all
my
fortune
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
let
him
please
himself
with
that
#
160
two
or
three
days
,
and
then
,
*NL*
having
been
abroad
that
day
,
and
as
if
I
had
been
to
fetch
it
,
I
*NL*
brought
him
#
100
more
home
in
gold
,
and
told
him
there
was
a
little
*NL*
more
portion
for
him
;
and
,
in
short
,
in
about
a
week
more
I
brought
him
*NL*
#
180
more
,
and
about
#
60
in
linen
,
which
I
made
him
believe
I
had
been
*NL*
obliged
to
take
with
the
#
100
which
I
gave
him
in
gold
,
as
a
*NL*
composition
for
a
debt
of
#
600
,
being
little
more
than
five
shillings
*NL*
in
the
pound
,
and
overvalued
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
now
,
my
dear
,
'
says
I
to
him
,
'
I
am
very
sorry
to
tell
you
,
that
*NL*
there
is
all
,
and
that
I
have
given
you
my
whole
fortune
.
'
I
added
,
*NL*
that
if
the
person
who
had
my
#
600
had
not
abused
me
,
I
had
been
worth
*NL*
#
1000
to
him
,
but
that
as
it
was
,
I
had
been
faithful
to
him
,
and
*NL*
reserved
nothing
to
myself
,
but
if
it
had
been
more
he
should
have
had
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
so
obliged
by
the
manner
,
and
so
pleased
with
the
sum
,
for
he
*NL*
had
been
in
a
terrible
fright
lest
it
had
been
nothing
at
all
,
that
he
*NL*
accepted
it
very
thankfully
.
And
thus
I
got
over
the
fraud
of
passing
*NL*
for
a
fortune
without
money
,
and
cheating
a
man
into
marrying
me
on
*NL*
pretence
of
a
fortune
;
which
,
by
the
way
,
I
take
to
be
one
of
the
most
*NL*
dangerous
steps
a
woman
can
take
,
and
in
which
she
runs
the
most
hazard
*NL*
of
being
ill-used
afterwards
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
husband
,
to
give
him
his
due
,
was
a
man
of
infinite
good
nature
,
but
*NL*
he
was
no
fool
;
and
finding
his
income
not
suited
to
the
manner
of
*NL*
living
which
he
had
intended
,
if
I
had
brought
him
what
he
expected
,
*NL*
and
being
under
a
disappointment
in
his
return
of
his
plantations
in
*NL*
Virginia
,
he
discovered
many
times
his
inclination
of
going
over
to
*NL*
Virginia
,
to
live
upon
his
own
;
and
often
would
be
magnifying
the
way
*NL*
of
living
there
,
how
cheap
,
how
plentiful
,
how
pleasant
,
and
the
like
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
began
presently
to
understand
this
meaning
,
and
I
took
him
up
very
*NL*
plainly
one
morning
,
and
told
him
that
I
did
so
;
that
I
found
his
*NL*
estate
turned
to
no
account
at
this
distance
,
compared
to
what
it
would
*NL*
do
if
he
lived
upon
the
spot
,
and
that
I
found
he
had
a
mind
to
go
and
*NL*
live
there
;
and
I
added
,
that
I
was
sensible
he
had
been
disappointed
*NL*
in
a
wife
,
and
that
finding
his
expectations
not
answered
that
way
,
I
*NL*
could
do
no
less
,
to
make
him
amends
,
than
tell
him
that
I
was
very
*NL*
willing
to
go
over
to
Virginia
with
him
and
live
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
said
a
thousand
kind
things
to
me
upon
the
subject
of
my
making
such
*NL*
a
proposal
to
him
.
He
told
me
,
that
however
he
was
disappointed
in
his
*NL*
expectations
of
a
fortune
,
he
was
not
disappointed
in
a
wife
,
and
that
*NL*
I
was
all
to
him
that
a
wife
could
be
,
and
he
was
more
than
satisfied
*NL*
on
the
whole
when
the
particulars
were
put
together
,
but
that
this
*NL*
offer
was
so
kind
,
that
it
was
more
than
he
could
express
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
bring
the
story
short
,
we
agreed
to
go
.
He
told
me
that
he
had
a
*NL*
very
good
house
there
,
that
it
was
well
furnished
,
that
his
mother
was
*NL*
alive
and
lived
in
it
,
and
one
sister
,
which
was
all
the
relations
he
*NL*
had
;
that
as
soon
as
he
came
there
,
his
mother
would
remove
to
another
*NL*
house
,
which
was
her
own
for
life
,
and
his
after
her
decease
;
so
that
I
*NL*
should
have
all
the
house
to
myself
;
and
I
found
all
this
to
be
exactly
*NL*
as
he
had
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
make
this
part
of
the
story
short
,
we
put
on
board
the
ship
which
we
*NL*
went
in
,
a
large
quantity
of
good
furniture
for
our
house
,
with
stores
*NL*
of
linen
and
other
necessaries
,
and
a
good
cargo
for
sale
,
and
away
we
*NL*
went
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
give
an
account
of
the
manner
of
our
voyage
,
which
was
long
and
full
*NL*
of
dangers
,
is
out
of
my
way
;
I
kept
no
journal
,
neither
did
my
*NL*
husband
.
All
that
I
can
say
is
,
that
after
a
terrible
passage
,
*NL*
frighted
twice
with
dreadful
storms
,
and
once
with
what
was
still
more
*NL*
terrible
,
I
mean
a
pirate
who
came
on
board
and
took
away
almost
all
*NL*
our
provisions
;
and
which
would
have
been
beyond
all
to
me
,
they
had
*NL*
once
taken
my
husband
to
go
along
with
them
,
but
by
entreaties
were
*NL*
prevailed
with
to
leave
him
;
--
I
say
,
after
all
these
terrible
things
,
*NL*
we
arrived
in
York
River
in
Virginia
,
and
coming
to
our
plantation
,
we
*NL*
were
received
with
all
the
demonstrations
of
tenderness
and
affection
,
*NL*
by
my
husband
's
mother
,
that
were
possible
to
be
expressed
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
lived
here
all
together
,
my
mother-in-law
,
at
my
entreaty
,
*NL*
continuing
in
the
house
,
for
she
was
too
kind
a
mother
to
be
parted
*NL*
with
;
my
husband
likewise
continued
the
same
as
at
first
,
and
I
thought
*NL*
myself
the
happiest
creature
alive
,
when
an
odd
and
surprising
event
*NL*
put
an
end
to
all
that
felicity
in
a
moment
,
and
rendered
my
condition
*NL*
the
most
uncomfortable
,
if
not
the
most
miserable
,
in
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
mother
was
a
mighty
cheerful
,
good-humoured
old
woman
--
I
may
call
*NL*
her
old
woman
,
for
her
son
was
above
thirty
;
I
say
she
was
very
*NL*
pleasant
,
good
company
,
and
used
to
entertain
me
,
in
particular
,
with
*NL*
abundance
of
stories
to
divert
me
,
as
well
of
the
country
we
were
in
*NL*
as
of
the
people
.
*NL*
*NL*
Among
the
rest
,
she
often
told
me
how
the
greatest
part
of
the
*NL*
inhabitants
of
the
colony
came
thither
in
very
indifferent
*NL*
circumstances
from
England
;
that
,
generally
speaking
,
they
were
of
two
*NL*
sorts
;
either
,
first
,
such
as
were
brought
over
by
masters
of
ships
to
*NL*
be
sold
as
servants
.
`
Such
as
we
call
them
,
my
dear
,
'
says
she
,
`
but
*NL*
they
are
more
properly
called
slaves
.
'
Or
,
secondly
,
such
as
are
*NL*
transported
from
Newgate
and
other
prisons
,
after
having
been
found
*NL*
guilty
of
felony
and
other
crimes
punishable
with
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
When
they
come
here
,
'
says
she
,
`
we
make
no
difference
;
the
planters
*NL*
buy
them
,
and
they
work
together
in
the
field
till
their
time
is
out
.
*NL*
When
't
is
expired
,
'
said
she
,
`
they
have
encouragement
given
them
to
*NL*
plant
for
themselves
;
for
they
have
a
certain
number
of
acres
of
land
*NL*
allotted
them
by
the
country
,
and
they
go
to
work
to
clear
and
cure
the
*NL*
land
,
and
then
to
plant
it
with
tobacco
and
corn
for
their
own
use
;
and
*NL*
as
the
tradesmen
and
merchants
will
trust
them
with
tools
and
clothes
*NL*
and
other
necessaries
,
upon
the
credit
of
their
crop
before
it
is
*NL*
grown
,
so
they
again
plant
every
year
a
little
more
than
the
year
*NL*
before
,
and
so
buy
whatever
they
want
with
the
crop
that
is
before
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Hence
,
child
,
'
says
she
,
`
man
a
Newgate-bird
becomes
a
great
man
,
and
*NL*
we
have
,
'
continued
she
,
`
several
justices
of
the
peace
,
officers
of
*NL*
the
trained
bands
,
and
magistrates
of
the
towns
they
live
in
,
that
have
*NL*
been
burnt
in
the
hand
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
going
on
with
that
part
of
the
story
,
when
her
own
part
in
it
*NL*
interrupted
her
,
and
with
a
great
deal
of
good-humoured
confidence
she
*NL*
told
me
she
was
one
of
the
second
sort
of
inhabitants
herself
;
that
she
*NL*
came
away
openly
,
having
ventured
too
far
in
a
particular
case
,
so
that
*NL*
she
was
become
a
criminal
.
`
And
here
's
the
mark
of
it
,
child
,
'
says
*NL*
she
;
and
,
pulling
off
her
glove
,
`
look
ye
here
,
'
says
she
,
turning
up
*NL*
the
palm
of
her
hand
,
and
showed
me
a
very
fine
white
arm
and
hand
,
but
*NL*
branded
in
the
inside
of
the
hand
,
as
in
such
cases
it
must
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
story
was
very
moving
to
me
,
but
my
mother
,
smiling
,
said
,
`
You
*NL*
need
not
think
a
thing
strange
,
daughter
,
for
as
I
told
you
,
some
of
*NL*
the
best
men
in
this
country
are
burnt
in
the
hand
,
and
they
are
not
*NL*
ashamed
to
own
it
.
There
's
Major
--
,
'
says
she
,
`
he
was
an
eminent
*NL*
pickpocket
;
there
's
Justice
Ba
--
r
,
was
a
shoplifter
,
and
both
of
them
*NL*
were
burnt
in
the
hand
;
and
I
could
name
you
several
such
as
they
are
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
frequent
discourses
of
this
kind
,
and
abundance
of
instances
she
*NL*
gave
me
of
the
like
.
After
some
time
,
as
she
was
telling
some
stories
*NL*
of
one
that
was
transported
but
a
few
weeks
ago
,
I
began
in
an
intimate
*NL*
kind
of
way
to
ask
her
to
tell
me
something
of
her
own
story
,
which
she
*NL*
did
with
the
utmost
plainness
and
sincerity
;
how
she
had
fallen
into
*NL*
very
ill
company
in
London
in
her
young
days
,
occasioned
by
her
mother
*NL*
sending
her
frequently
to
carry
victuals
and
other
relief
to
a
*NL*
kinswoman
of
hers
who
was
a
prisoner
in
Newgate
,
and
who
lay
in
a
*NL*
miserable
starving
condition
,
was
afterwards
condemned
to
be
hanged
,
*NL*
but
having
got
respite
by
pleading
her
belly
,
dies
afterwards
in
the
*NL*
prison
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
my
mother-in-law
ran
out
in
a
long
account
of
the
wicked
practices
*NL*
in
that
dreadful
place
,
and
how
it
ruined
more
young
people
that
all
*NL*
the
town
besides
.
`
And
child
,
'
says
my
mother
,
`
perhaps
you
may
know
*NL*
little
of
it
,
or
,
it
may
be
,
have
heard
nothing
about
it
;
but
depend
*NL*
upon
it
,
'
says
she
,
`
we
all
know
here
that
there
are
more
thieves
and
*NL*
rogues
made
by
that
one
prison
of
Newgate
than
by
all
the
clubs
and
*NL*
societies
of
villains
in
the
nation
;
't
is
that
cursed
place
,
'
says
my
*NL*
mother
,
`
that
half
peopled
this
colony
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Here
she
went
on
with
her
own
story
so
long
,
and
in
so
particular
a
*NL*
manner
,
that
I
began
to
be
very
uneasy
;
but
coming
to
one
particular
*NL*
that
required
telling
her
name
,
I
thought
I
should
have
sunk
down
in
*NL*
the
place
.
She
perceived
I
was
out
of
order
,
and
asked
me
if
I
was
not
*NL*
well
,
and
what
ailed
me
.
I
told
her
I
was
so
affected
with
the
*NL*
melancholy
story
she
had
told
,
and
the
terrible
things
she
had
gone
*NL*
through
,
that
it
had
overcome
me
,
and
I
begged
of
her
to
talk
no
more
*NL*
of
it
.
`
Why
,
my
dear
,
'
says
she
very
kindly
,
`
what
need
these
things
*NL*
trouble
you
?
These
passages
were
long
before
your
time
,
and
they
give
*NL*
me
no
trouble
at
all
now
;
nay
,
I
look
back
on
them
with
a
particular
*NL*
satisfaction
,
as
they
have
been
a
means
to
bring
me
to
this
place
.
'
*NL*
Then
she
went
on
to
tell
me
how
she
very
luckily
fell
into
a
good
*NL*
family
,
where
,
behaving
herself
well
,
and
her
mistress
dying
,
her
*NL*
master
married
her
,
by
whom
she
had
my
husband
and
his
sister
,
and
that
*NL*
by
her
diligence
and
good
management
after
her
husband
's
death
,
she
had
*NL*
improved
the
plantations
to
such
a
degree
as
they
then
were
,
so
that
*NL*
most
of
the
estate
was
of
her
getting
,
not
her
husband
's
,
for
she
had
*NL*
been
a
widow
upwards
of
sixteen
years
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
heard
this
part
of
they
story
with
very
little
attention
,
because
I
*NL*
wanted
much
to
retire
and
give
vent
to
my
passions
,
which
I
did
soon
*NL*
after
;
and
let
any
one
judge
what
must
be
the
anguish
of
my
mind
,
when
*NL*
I
came
to
reflect
that
this
was
certainly
no
more
or
less
than
my
own
*NL*
mother
,
and
I
had
now
had
two
children
,
and
was
big
with
another
by
my
*NL*
own
brother
,
and
lay
with
him
still
every
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
now
the
most
unhappy
of
all
women
in
the
world
.
Oh
!
had
the
*NL*
story
never
been
told
me
,
all
had
been
well
;
it
had
been
no
crime
to
*NL*
have
lain
with
my
husband
,
since
as
to
his
being
my
relation
I
had
*NL*
known
nothing
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
now
such
a
load
on
my
mind
that
it
kept
me
perpetually
waking
;
to
*NL*
reveal
it
,
which
would
have
been
some
ease
to
me
,
I
could
not
find
*NL*
would
be
to
any
purpose
,
and
yet
to
conceal
it
would
be
next
to
*NL*
impossible
;
nay
,
I
did
not
doubt
but
I
should
talk
of
it
in
my
sleep
,
*NL*
and
tell
my
husband
of
it
whether
I
would
or
no
.
If
I
discovered
it
,
*NL*
the
least
thing
I
could
expect
was
to
lose
my
husband
,
for
he
was
too
*NL*
nice
and
too
honest
a
man
to
have
continued
my
husband
after
he
had
*NL*
known
I
had
been
his
sister
;
so
that
I
was
perplexed
to
the
last
degree
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
leave
it
to
any
man
to
judge
what
difficulties
presented
to
my
view
.
*NL*
I
was
away
from
my
native
country
,
at
a
distance
prodigious
,
and
the
*NL*
return
to
me
unpassable
.
I
lived
very
well
,
but
in
a
circumstance
*NL*
insufferable
in
itself
.
If
I
had
discovered
myself
to
my
mother
,
it
*NL*
might
be
difficult
to
convince
her
of
the
particulars
,
and
I
had
no
way
*NL*
to
prove
them
.
On
the
other
hand
,
if
she
had
questioned
or
doubted
me
,
*NL*
I
had
been
undone
,
for
the
bare
suggestion
would
have
immediately
*NL*
separated
me
from
my
husband
,
without
gaining
my
mother
or
him
,
who
*NL*
would
have
been
neither
a
husband
nor
a
brother
;
so
that
between
the
*NL*
surprise
on
one
hand
,
and
the
uncertainty
on
the
other
,
I
had
been
sure
*NL*
to
be
undone
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
,
as
I
was
but
too
sure
of
the
fact
,
I
lived
therefore
*NL*
in
open
avowed
incest
and
whoredom
,
and
all
under
the
appearance
of
an
*NL*
honest
wife
;
and
though
I
was
not
much
touched
with
the
crime
of
it
,
*NL*
yet
the
action
had
something
in
it
shocking
to
nature
,
and
made
my
*NL*
husband
,
as
he
thought
himself
,
even
nauseous
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
upon
the
most
sedate
consideration
,
I
resolved
that
it
was
*NL*
absolutely
necessary
to
conceal
it
all
and
not
make
the
least
discovery
*NL*
of
it
either
to
mother
or
husband
;
and
thus
I
lived
with
the
greatest
*NL*
pressure
imaginable
for
three
years
more
,
but
had
no
more
children
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
this
time
my
mother
used
to
be
frequently
telling
me
old
stories
*NL*
of
her
former
adventures
,
which
,
however
,
were
no
ways
pleasant
to
me
;
*NL*
for
by
it
,
though
she
did
not
tell
it
me
in
plain
terms
,
yet
I
could
*NL*
easily
understand
,
joined
with
what
I
had
heard
myself
,
of
my
first
*NL*
tutors
,
that
in
her
younger
days
she
had
been
both
whore
and
thief
;
but
*NL*
I
verily
believed
she
had
lived
to
repent
sincerely
of
both
,
and
that
*NL*
she
was
then
a
very
pious
,
sober
,
and
religious
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
let
her
life
have
been
what
it
would
then
,
it
was
certain
that
my
*NL*
life
was
very
uneasy
to
me
;
for
I
lived
,
as
I
have
said
,
but
in
the
*NL*
worst
sort
of
whoredom
,
and
as
I
could
expect
no
good
of
it
,
so
really
*NL*
no
good
issue
came
of
it
,
and
all
my
seeming
prosperity
wore
off
,
and
*NL*
ended
in
misery
and
destruction
.
It
was
some
time
,
indeed
,
before
it
*NL*
came
to
this
,
for
,
but
I
know
not
by
what
ill
fate
guided
,
everything
*NL*
went
wrong
with
us
afterwards
,
and
that
which
was
worse
,
my
husband
*NL*
grew
strangely
altered
,
forward
,
jealous
,
and
unkind
,
and
I
was
as
*NL*
impatient
of
bearing
his
carriage
,
as
the
carriage
was
unreasonable
and
*NL*
unjust
.
These
things
proceeded
so
far
,
that
we
came
at
last
to
be
in
*NL*
such
ill
terms
with
one
another
,
that
I
claimed
a
promise
of
him
,
which
*NL*
he
entered
willingly
into
with
me
when
I
consented
to
come
from
England
*NL*
with
him
,
viz
.
that
if
I
found
the
country
not
to
agree
with
me
,
or
*NL*
that
I
did
not
like
to
live
there
,
I
should
come
away
to
England
again
*NL*
when
I
pleased
,
giving
him
a
year
's
warning
to
settle
his
affairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
say
,
I
now
claimed
this
promise
of
him
,
and
I
must
confess
I
did
it
*NL*
not
in
the
most
obliging
terms
that
could
be
in
the
world
neither
;
but
*NL*
I
insisted
that
he
treated
me
ill
,
that
I
was
remote
from
my
friends
,
*NL*
and
could
do
myself
no
justice
,
and
that
he
was
jealous
without
cause
,
*NL*
my
conversation
having
been
unblamable
,
and
he
having
no
pretense
for
*NL*
it
,
and
that
to
remove
to
England
would
take
away
all
occasion
from
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
insisted
so
peremptorily
upon
it
,
that
he
could
not
avoid
coming
to
a
*NL*
point
,
either
to
keep
his
word
with
me
or
to
break
it
;
and
this
,
*NL*
notwithstanding
he
used
all
the
skill
he
was
master
of
,
and
employed
*NL*
his
mother
and
other
agents
to
prevail
with
me
to
alter
my
resolutions
;
*NL*
indeed
,
the
bottom
of
the
thing
lay
at
my
heart
,
and
that
made
all
his
*NL*
endeavours
fruitless
,
for
my
heart
was
alienated
from
him
as
a
husband
.
*NL*
I
loathed
the
thoughts
of
bedding
with
him
,
and
used
a
thousand
*NL*
pretenses
of
illness
and
humour
to
prevent
his
touching
me
,
fearing
*NL*
nothing
more
than
to
be
with
child
by
him
,
which
to
be
sure
would
have
*NL*
prevented
,
or
at
least
delayed
,
my
going
over
to
England
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
at
last
I
put
him
so
out
of
humour
,
that
he
took
up
a
rash
and
*NL*
fatal
resolution
;
in
short
,
I
should
not
go
to
England
;
and
though
he
*NL*
had
promised
me
,
yet
it
was
an
unreasonable
thing
for
me
to
desire
it
;
*NL*
that
it
would
be
ruinous
to
his
affairs
,
would
unhinge
his
whole
*NL*
family
,
and
be
next
to
an
undoing
him
in
the
world
;
that
therefore
I
*NL*
ought
not
to
desire
it
of
him
,
and
that
no
wife
in
the
world
that
*NL*
valued
her
family
and
her
husband
's
prosperity
would
insist
upon
such
a
*NL*
thing
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
plunged
me
again
,
for
when
I
considered
the
thing
calmly
,
and
took
*NL*
my
husband
as
he
really
was
,
a
diligent
,
careful
man
in
the
main
work
*NL*
of
laying
up
an
estate
for
his
children
,
and
that
he
knew
nothing
of
*NL*
the
dreadful
circumstances
that
he
was
in
,
I
could
not
but
confess
to
*NL*
myself
that
my
proposal
was
very
unreasonable
,
and
what
no
wife
that
*NL*
had
the
good
of
her
family
at
heart
would
have
desired
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
my
discontents
were
of
another
nature
;
I
looked
upon
him
no
longer
*NL*
as
a
husband
,
but
as
a
near
relation
,
the
son
of
my
own
mother
,
and
I
*NL*
resolved
somehow
or
other
to
be
clear
of
him
,
but
which
way
I
did
not
*NL*
know
,
nor
did
it
seem
possible
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
said
by
the
ill-natured
world
,
of
our
sex
,
that
if
we
are
set
on
*NL*
a
thing
,
it
is
impossible
to
turn
us
from
our
resolutions
;
in
short
,
I
*NL*
never
ceased
poring
upon
the
means
to
bring
to
pass
my
voyage
,
and
came
*NL*
that
length
with
my
husband
at
last
,
as
to
propose
going
without
him
.
*NL*
This
provoked
him
to
the
last
degree
,
and
he
called
me
not
only
an
*NL*
unkind
wife
,
but
an
unnatural
mother
,
and
asked
me
how
I
could
*NL*
entertain
such
a
thought
without
horror
,
as
that
of
leaving
my
two
*NL*
children
-LRB-
for
one
was
dead
-RRB-
without
a
mother
,
and
to
be
brought
up
by
*NL*
strangers
,
and
never
to
see
them
more
.
It
was
true
,
had
things
been
*NL*
right
,
I
should
not
have
done
it
,
but
now
it
was
my
real
desire
never
*NL*
to
see
them
,
or
him
either
,
any
more
;
and
as
to
the
charge
of
*NL*
unnatural
,
I
could
easily
answer
it
to
myself
,
while
I
knew
that
the
*NL*
whole
relation
was
unnatural
in
the
highest
degree
in
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
it
was
plain
there
was
no
bringing
my
husband
to
anything
;
he
*NL*
would
neither
go
with
me
nor
let
me
go
without
him
,
and
it
was
quite
*NL*
out
of
my
power
to
stir
without
his
consent
,
as
any
one
that
knows
the
*NL*
constitution
of
the
country
I
was
in
,
knows
very
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
many
family
quarrels
about
it
,
and
they
began
in
time
to
grow
up
*NL*
to
a
dangerous
height
;
for
as
I
was
quite
estranged
form
my
husband
-LRB-
as
*NL*
he
was
called
-RRB-
in
affection
,
so
I
took
no
heed
to
my
words
,
but
*NL*
sometimes
gave
him
language
that
was
provoking
;
and
,
in
short
,
strove
*NL*
all
I
could
to
bring
him
to
a
parting
with
me
,
which
was
what
above
all
*NL*
things
in
the
world
I
desired
most
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
my
carriage
very
ill
,
and
indeed
he
might
well
do
so
,
for
at
*NL*
last
I
refused
to
bed
with
him
,
and
carrying
on
the
breach
upon
all
*NL*
occasions
to
extremity
,
he
told
me
once
he
thought
I
was
mad
,
and
if
I
*NL*
did
not
alter
my
conduct
,
he
would
put
me
under
cure
;
that
is
to
say
,
*NL*
into
a
madhouse
.
I
told
him
he
should
find
I
was
far
enough
from
mad
,
*NL*
and
that
it
was
not
in
his
power
,
or
any
other
villain
's
,
to
murder
me
.
*NL*
I
confess
at
the
same
time
I
was
heartily
frighted
at
his
thoughts
of
*NL*
putting
me
into
a
madhouse
,
which
would
at
once
have
destroyed
all
the
*NL*
possibility
of
breaking
the
truth
out
,
whatever
the
occasion
might
be
;
*NL*
for
that
then
no
one
would
have
given
credit
to
a
word
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
therefore
brought
me
to
a
resolution
,
whatever
came
of
it
,
to
lay
*NL*
open
my
whole
case
;
but
which
way
to
do
it
,
or
to
whom
,
was
an
*NL*
inextricable
difficulty
,
and
took
me
many
months
to
resolve
.
In
the
*NL*
meantime
,
another
quarrel
with
my
husband
happened
,
which
came
up
to
*NL*
such
a
mad
extreme
as
almost
pushed
me
on
to
tell
it
him
all
to
his
*NL*
face
;
but
though
I
kept
it
in
so
as
not
to
come
to
the
particulars
,
I
*NL*
spoke
so
much
as
put
him
into
the
utmost
confusion
,
and
in
the
end
*NL*
brought
out
the
whole
story
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
began
with
a
calm
expostulation
upon
my
being
so
resolute
to
go
to
*NL*
England
;
I
defended
it
,
and
one
hard
word
bringing
on
another
,
as
is
*NL*
usual
in
all
family
strife
,
he
told
me
I
did
not
treat
him
as
if
he
was
*NL*
my
husband
,
or
talk
of
my
children
as
if
I
was
a
mother
;
and
,
in
short
,
*NL*
that
I
did
not
deserve
to
be
used
as
a
wife
;
that
he
had
used
all
the
*NL*
fair
means
possible
with
me
;
that
he
had
argued
with
all
the
kindness
*NL*
and
calmness
that
a
husband
or
a
Christian
ought
to
do
,
and
that
I
made
*NL*
him
such
a
vile
return
,
that
I
treated
him
rather
like
a
dog
than
a
*NL*
man
,
and
rather
like
the
most
contemptible
stranger
than
a
husband
;
*NL*
that
he
was
very
loth
to
use
violence
with
me
,
but
that
,
in
short
,
he
*NL*
saw
a
necessity
of
it
now
,
and
that
for
the
future
he
should
be
obliged
*NL*
to
take
such
measures
as
should
reduce
me
to
my
duty
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
blood
was
now
fired
to
the
utmost
,
though
I
knew
what
he
had
said
*NL*
was
very
true
,
and
nothing
could
appear
more
provoked
.
I
told
him
,
for
*NL*
his
fair
means
and
his
foul
,
they
were
equally
contemned
by
me
;
that
*NL*
for
my
going
to
England
,
I
was
resolved
on
it
,
come
what
would
;
and
*NL*
that
as
to
treating
him
not
like
a
husband
,
and
not
showing
myself
a
*NL*
mother
to
my
children
,
there
might
be
something
more
in
it
than
he
*NL*
understood
at
present
;
but
,
for
his
further
consideration
,
I
thought
*NL*
fit
to
tell
him
thus
much
,
that
he
neither
was
my
lawful
husband
,
nor
*NL*
they
lawful
children
,
and
that
I
had
reason
to
regard
neither
of
them
*NL*
more
than
I
did
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
confess
I
was
moved
to
pity
him
when
I
spoke
it
,
for
he
turned
pale
*NL*
as
death
,
and
stood
mute
as
one
thunderstruck
,
and
once
or
twice
I
*NL*
thought
he
would
have
fainted
;
in
short
,
it
put
him
in
a
fit
something
*NL*
like
an
apoplex
;
he
trembled
,
a
sweat
or
dew
ran
off
his
face
,
and
yet
*NL*
he
was
cold
as
a
clod
,
so
that
I
was
forced
to
run
and
fetch
something
*NL*
for
him
to
keep
life
in
him
.
When
he
recovered
of
that
,
he
grew
sick
*NL*
and
vomited
,
and
in
a
little
after
was
put
to
bed
,
and
the
next
morning
*NL*
was
,
as
he
had
been
indeed
all
night
,
in
a
violent
fever
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
it
went
off
again
,
and
he
recovered
,
though
but
slowly
,
and
*NL*
when
he
came
to
be
a
little
better
,
he
told
me
I
had
given
him
a
mortal
*NL*
wound
with
my
tongue
,
and
he
had
only
one
thing
to
ask
before
he
*NL*
desired
an
explanation
.
I
interrupted
him
,
and
told
him
I
was
sorry
I
*NL*
had
gone
so
far
,
since
I
saw
what
disorder
it
put
him
into
,
but
I
*NL*
desired
him
not
to
talk
to
me
of
explanations
,
for
that
would
but
make
*NL*
things
worse
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
heightened
his
impatience
,
and
,
indeed
,
perplexed
him
beyond
all
*NL*
bearing
;
for
now
he
began
to
suspect
that
there
was
some
mystery
yet
*NL*
unfolded
,
but
could
not
make
the
least
guess
at
the
real
particulars
of
*NL*
it
;
all
that
ran
in
his
brain
was
,
that
I
had
another
husband
alive
,
*NL*
which
I
could
not
say
in
fact
might
not
be
true
,
but
I
assured
him
,
*NL*
however
,
there
was
not
the
least
of
that
in
it
;
and
indeed
,
as
to
my
*NL*
other
husband
,
he
was
effectually
dead
in
law
to
me
,
and
had
told
me
I
*NL*
should
look
on
him
as
such
,
so
I
had
not
the
least
uneasiness
on
that
*NL*
score
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
now
I
found
the
thing
too
far
gone
to
conceal
it
much
longer
,
and
*NL*
my
husband
himself
gave
me
an
opportunity
to
ease
myself
of
the
secret
,
*NL*
much
to
my
satisfaction
.
He
had
laboured
with
me
three
or
four
weeks
,
*NL*
but
to
no
purpose
,
only
to
tell
him
whether
I
had
spoken
these
words
*NL*
only
as
the
effect
of
my
passion
,
to
put
him
in
a
passion
,
or
whether
*NL*
there
was
anything
of
truth
in
the
bottom
of
them
.
But
I
continued
*NL*
inflexible
,
and
would
explain
nothing
,
unless
he
would
first
consent
to
*NL*
my
going
to
England
,
which
he
would
never
do
,
he
said
,
while
he
lived
;
*NL*
on
the
other
hand
,
I
said
it
was
in
my
power
to
make
him
willing
when
I
*NL*
pleased
--
nay
,
to
make
him
entreat
me
to
go
;
and
this
increased
his
*NL*
curiosity
,
and
made
him
importunate
to
the
highest
degree
,
but
it
was
*NL*
all
to
no
purpose
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
he
tells
all
this
story
to
his
mother
,
and
sets
her
upon
me
*NL*
to
get
the
main
secret
out
of
me
,
and
she
used
her
utmost
skill
with
me
*NL*
indeed
;
but
I
put
her
to
a
full
stop
at
once
by
telling
her
that
the
*NL*
reason
and
mystery
of
the
whole
matter
lay
in
herself
,
and
that
it
was
*NL*
my
respect
to
her
that
had
made
me
conceal
it
;
and
that
,
in
short
,
I
*NL*
could
go
no
farther
,
and
therefore
conjured
her
not
to
insist
upon
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
struck
dumb
at
this
suggestion
,
and
could
not
tell
what
to
say
*NL*
or
to
think
;
but
,
laying
aside
the
supposition
as
a
policy
of
mine
,
*NL*
continued
her
importunity
on
account
of
her
son
,
and
,
if
possible
,
to
*NL*
make
up
the
breach
between
us
two
.
As
to
that
,
I
told
her
that
it
was
*NL*
indeed
a
good
design
in
her
,
but
that
it
was
impossible
to
be
done
;
and
*NL*
that
if
I
should
reveal
to
her
the
truth
of
what
she
desired
,
she
would
*NL*
grant
it
to
be
impossible
,
and
cease
to
desire
it
.
At
last
I
seemed
to
*NL*
be
prevailed
on
by
her
importunity
,
and
told
her
I
dared
trust
her
with
*NL*
a
secret
of
the
greatest
importance
,
and
she
would
soon
see
that
this
*NL*
was
so
,
and
that
I
would
consent
to
lodge
it
in
her
breast
,
if
she
*NL*
would
engage
solemnly
not
to
acquaint
her
son
with
it
without
my
*NL*
consent
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
long
in
promising
this
part
,
but
rather
than
not
come
at
the
*NL*
main
secret
,
she
agreed
to
that
too
,
and
after
a
great
many
other
*NL*
preliminaries
,
I
began
,
and
told
her
the
whole
story
.
First
I
told
her
*NL*
how
much
she
was
concerned
in
all
the
unhappy
breach
which
had
happened
*NL*
between
her
son
and
me
,
by
telling
me
her
own
story
and
her
London
*NL*
name
;
and
that
the
surprise
she
saw
I
was
in
was
upon
that
occasion
.
*NL*
The
I
told
her
my
own
story
,
and
my
name
,
and
assured
her
,
by
such
*NL*
other
tokens
as
she
could
not
deny
,
that
I
was
no
other
,
nor
more
or
*NL*
less
,
than
her
own
child
,
her
daughter
,
born
of
her
body
in
Newgate
;
*NL*
the
same
that
had
saved
her
from
the
gallows
by
being
in
her
belly
,
and
*NL*
the
same
that
she
left
in
such-and-such
hands
when
she
was
transported
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
impossible
to
express
the
astonishment
she
was
in
;
she
was
not
*NL*
inclined
to
believe
the
story
,
or
to
remember
the
particulars
,
for
she
*NL*
immediately
foresaw
the
confusion
that
must
follow
in
the
family
upon
*NL*
it
.
But
everything
concurred
so
exactly
with
the
stories
she
had
told
*NL*
me
of
herself
,
and
which
,
if
she
had
not
told
me
,
she
would
perhaps
*NL*
have
been
content
to
have
denied
,
that
she
had
stopped
her
own
mouth
,
*NL*
and
she
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
take
me
about
the
neck
and
kiss
me
,
*NL*
and
cry
most
vehemently
over
me
,
without
speaking
one
word
for
a
long
*NL*
time
together
.
At
last
she
broke
out
:
`
Unhappy
child
!
'
says
she
,
*NL*
`
what
miserable
chance
could
bring
thee
hither
?
and
in
the
arms
of
my
*NL*
own
son
,
too
!
Dreadful
girl
,
'
says
she
,
`
why
,
we
are
all
undone
!
*NL*
Married
to
thy
own
brother
!
Three
children
,
and
two
alive
,
all
of
the
*NL*
same
flesh
and
blood
!
My
son
and
my
daughter
lying
together
as
husband
*NL*
and
wife
!
All
confusion
and
distraction
for
ever
!
Miserable
family
!
*NL*
what
will
become
of
us
?
What
is
to
be
said
?
What
is
to
be
done
?
'
And
*NL*
thus
she
ran
on
for
a
great
while
;
nor
had
I
any
power
to
speak
,
or
if
*NL*
I
had
,
did
I
know
what
to
say
,
for
every
word
wounded
me
to
the
soul
.
*NL*
With
this
kind
of
amazement
on
our
thoughts
we
parted
for
the
first
*NL*
time
,
though
my
mother
was
more
surprised
than
I
was
,
because
it
was
*NL*
more
news
to
her
than
to
me
.
However
,
she
promised
again
to
me
at
*NL*
parting
,
that
she
would
say
nothing
of
it
to
her
son
,
till
we
had
*NL*
talked
of
it
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
long
,
you
may
be
sure
,
before
we
had
a
second
conference
*NL*
upon
the
same
subject
;
when
,
as
if
she
had
been
willing
to
forget
the
*NL*
story
she
had
told
me
of
herself
,
or
to
suppose
that
I
had
forgot
some
*NL*
of
the
particulars
,
she
began
to
tell
them
with
alterations
and
*NL*
omissions
;
but
I
refreshed
her
memory
and
set
her
to
rights
in
many
*NL*
things
which
I
supposed
she
had
forgot
,
and
then
came
in
so
opportunely
*NL*
with
the
whole
history
,
that
it
was
impossible
for
her
to
go
from
it
;
*NL*
and
then
she
fell
into
her
rhapsodies
again
,
and
exclamations
at
the
*NL*
severity
of
her
misfortunes
.
When
these
things
were
a
little
over
with
*NL*
her
,
we
fell
into
a
close
debate
about
what
should
be
first
done
before
*NL*
we
gave
an
account
of
the
matter
to
my
husband
.
But
to
what
purpose
*NL*
could
be
all
our
consultations
?
We
could
neither
of
us
see
our
way
*NL*
through
it
,
nor
see
how
it
could
be
safe
to
open
such
a
scene
to
him
.
*NL*
It
was
impossible
to
make
any
judgment
,
or
give
any
guess
at
what
*NL*
temper
he
would
receive
it
in
,
or
what
measures
he
would
take
upon
it
;
*NL*
and
if
he
should
have
so
little
government
of
himself
as
to
make
it
*NL*
public
,
we
easily
foresaw
that
it
would
be
the
ruin
of
the
whole
*NL*
family
,
and
expose
my
mother
and
me
to
the
last
degree
;
and
if
at
last
*NL*
he
should
take
the
advantage
the
law
would
give
him
,
he
might
put
me
*NL*
away
with
disdain
and
leave
me
to
sue
for
the
little
portion
that
I
*NL*
had
,
and
perhaps
waste
it
all
in
the
suit
,
and
then
be
a
beggar
;
the
*NL*
children
would
be
ruined
too
,
having
no
legal
claim
to
any
of
his
*NL*
effects
;
and
thus
I
should
see
him
,
perhaps
,
in
the
arms
of
another
*NL*
wife
in
a
few
months
,
and
be
myself
the
most
miserable
creature
alive
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
mother
was
as
sensible
of
this
as
I
;
and
,
upon
the
whole
,
we
knew
*NL*
not
what
to
do
.
After
some
time
we
came
to
more
sober
resolutions
,
but
*NL*
then
it
was
with
this
misfortune
too
,
that
my
mother
's
opinion
and
mine
*NL*
were
quite
different
from
one
another
,
and
indeed
inconsistent
with
one
*NL*
another
;
for
my
mother
's
opinion
was
,
that
I
should
bury
the
whole
*NL*
thing
entirely
,
and
continue
to
live
with
him
as
my
husband
till
some
*NL*
other
event
should
make
the
discovery
of
it
more
convenient
;
and
that
*NL*
in
the
meantime
she
would
endeavour
to
reconcile
us
together
again
,
and
*NL*
restore
our
mutual
comfort
and
family
peace
;
that
we
might
lie
as
we
*NL*
used
to
do
together
,
and
so
let
the
whole
matter
remain
a
secret
as
*NL*
close
as
death
.
`
For
,
child
,
'
says
she
,
`
we
are
both
undone
if
it
*NL*
comes
out
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
To
encourage
me
to
this
,
she
promised
to
make
me
easy
in
my
*NL*
circumstances
,
as
far
as
she
was
able
,
and
to
leave
me
what
she
could
*NL*
at
her
death
,
secured
for
me
separately
from
my
husband
;
so
that
if
it
*NL*
should
come
out
afterwards
,
I
should
not
be
left
destitute
,
but
be
able
*NL*
to
stand
on
my
own
feet
and
procure
justice
from
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
proposal
did
not
agree
at
all
with
my
judgment
of
the
thing
,
*NL*
though
it
was
very
fair
and
kind
in
my
mother
;
but
my
thoughts
ran
*NL*
quite
another
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
to
keeping
the
thing
in
our
own
breasts
,
and
letting
it
all
remain
*NL*
as
it
was
,
I
told
her
it
was
impossible
;
and
I
asked
her
how
she
could
*NL*
think
I
could
bear
the
thoughts
of
lying
with
my
own
brother
.
In
the
*NL*
next
place
,
I
told
her
that
her
being
alive
was
the
only
support
of
the
*NL*
discovery
,
and
that
while
she
owned
me
for
her
child
,
and
saw
reason
to
*NL*
be
satisfied
that
I
was
so
,
nobody
else
would
doubt
it
;
but
that
if
she
*NL*
should
die
before
the
discovery
,
I
should
be
taken
for
an
impudent
*NL*
creature
that
had
forged
such
a
thing
to
go
away
from
my
husband
,
or
*NL*
should
be
counted
crazed
and
distracted
.
Then
I
told
her
how
he
had
*NL*
threatened
already
to
put
me
into
a
madhouse
,
and
what
concern
I
had
*NL*
been
in
about
it
,
and
how
that
was
the
thing
that
drove
me
to
the
*NL*
necessity
of
discovering
it
to
her
as
I
had
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
all
which
I
told
her
,
that
I
had
,
on
the
most
serious
reflections
*NL*
I
was
able
to
make
in
the
case
,
come
to
this
resolution
,
which
I
hoped
*NL*
she
would
like
,
as
a
medium
between
both
,
viz
.
that
she
should
use
her
*NL*
endeavours
with
her
son
to
give
me
leave
to
go
to
England
,
as
I
had
*NL*
desired
,
and
to
furnish
me
with
a
sufficient
sum
of
money
,
either
in
*NL*
goods
along
with
me
,
or
in
bills
for
my
support
there
,
all
along
*NL*
suggesting
that
he
might
one
time
or
other
think
it
proper
to
come
over
*NL*
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
when
I
was
gone
,
she
should
then
,
in
cold
blood
,
and
after
first
*NL*
obliging
him
in
the
solemnest
manner
possible
to
secrecy
,
discover
the
*NL*
case
to
him
,
doing
it
gradually
,
and
as
her
own
discretion
should
guide
*NL*
her
,
so
that
he
might
not
be
surprised
with
it
,
and
fly
out
into
any
*NL*
passions
and
excesses
on
my
account
,
or
on
hers
;
and
that
she
should
*NL*
concern
herself
to
prevent
his
slighting
the
children
,
or
marrying
*NL*
again
,
unless
he
had
a
certain
account
of
my
being
dead
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
my
scheme
,
and
my
reasons
were
good
;
I
was
really
alienated
*NL*
from
him
in
the
consequences
of
these
things
;
indeed
,
I
mortally
hated
*NL*
him
as
a
husband
,
and
it
was
impossible
to
remove
that
riveted
aversion
*NL*
I
had
to
him
.
At
the
same
time
,
it
being
an
unlawful
,
incestuous
*NL*
living
,
added
to
that
aversion
,
and
though
I
had
no
great
concern
about
*NL*
it
in
point
of
conscience
,
yet
everything
added
to
make
cohabiting
with
*NL*
him
the
most
nauseous
thing
to
me
in
the
world
;
and
I
think
verily
it
*NL*
was
come
to
such
a
height
,
that
I
could
almost
as
willingly
have
*NL*
embraced
a
dog
as
have
let
him
offer
anything
of
that
kind
to
me
,
for
*NL*
which
reason
I
could
not
bear
the
thoughts
of
coming
between
the
sheets
*NL*
with
him
.
I
can
not
say
that
I
was
right
in
point
of
policy
in
carrying
*NL*
it
such
a
length
,
while
at
the
same
time
I
did
not
resolve
to
discover
*NL*
the
thing
to
him
;
but
I
am
giving
an
account
of
what
was
,
not
of
what
*NL*
ought
or
ought
not
to
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
their
directly
opposite
opinion
to
one
another
my
mother
and
I
*NL*
continued
a
long
time
,
and
it
was
impossible
to
reconcile
our
*NL*
judgments
;
many
disputes
we
had
about
it
,
but
we
could
never
either
of
*NL*
us
yield
our
own
,
or
bring
over
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
insisted
on
my
aversion
to
lying
with
my
own
brother
,
and
she
*NL*
insisted
upon
its
being
impossible
to
bring
him
to
consent
to
my
going
*NL*
from
him
to
England
;
and
in
this
uncertainty
we
continued
,
not
*NL*
differing
so
as
to
quarrel
,
or
anything
like
it
,
but
so
as
not
to
be
*NL*
able
to
resolve
what
we
should
do
to
make
up
that
terrible
breach
that
*NL*
was
before
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
I
resolved
on
a
desperate
course
,
and
told
my
mother
my
*NL*
resolution
,
viz
.
that
,
in
short
,
I
would
tell
him
of
it
myself
.
My
*NL*
mother
was
frighted
to
the
last
degree
at
the
very
thoughts
of
it
;
but
*NL*
I
bid
her
be
easy
,
told
her
I
would
do
it
gradually
and
softly
,
and
*NL*
with
all
the
art
and
good-humour
I
was
mistress
of
,
and
time
it
also
as
*NL*
well
as
I
could
,
taking
him
in
good-humour
too
.
I
told
her
I
did
not
*NL*
question
but
,
if
I
could
be
hypocrite
enough
to
feign
more
affection
to
*NL*
him
than
I
really
had
,
I
should
succeed
in
all
my
design
,
and
we
might
*NL*
part
by
consent
,
and
with
a
good
agreement
,
for
I
might
live
him
well
*NL*
enough
for
a
brother
,
though
I
could
not
for
a
husband
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
while
he
lay
at
my
mother
to
find
out
,
if
possible
,
what
was
*NL*
the
meaning
of
that
dreadful
expression
of
mine
,
as
he
called
it
,
which
*NL*
I
mentioned
before
:
namely
,
that
I
was
not
his
lawful
wife
,
nor
my
*NL*
children
his
legal
children
.
My
mother
put
him
off
,
told
him
she
could
*NL*
bring
me
to
no
explanations
,
but
found
there
was
something
that
*NL*
disturbed
me
very
much
,
and
she
hoped
she
should
get
it
out
of
me
in
*NL*
time
,
and
in
the
meantime
recommended
to
him
earnestly
to
use
me
more
*NL*
tenderly
,
and
win
me
with
his
usual
good
carriage
;
told
him
of
his
*NL*
terrifying
and
affrighting
me
with
his
threats
of
sending
me
to
a
*NL*
madhouse
,
and
the
like
,
and
advised
him
not
to
make
a
woman
desperate
*NL*
on
any
account
whatever
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
promised
her
to
soften
his
behaviour
,
and
bid
her
assure
me
that
he
*NL*
loved
me
as
well
as
ever
,
and
that
he
had
so
such
design
as
that
of
*NL*
sending
me
to
a
madhouse
,
whatever
he
might
say
in
his
passion
;
also
he
*NL*
desired
my
mother
to
use
the
same
persuasions
to
me
too
,
that
our
*NL*
affections
might
be
renewed
,
and
we
might
lie
together
in
a
good
*NL*
understanding
as
we
used
to
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
found
the
effects
of
this
treaty
presently
.
My
husband
's
conduct
was
*NL*
immediately
altered
,
and
he
was
quite
another
man
to
me
;
nothing
could
*NL*
be
kinder
and
more
obliging
than
he
was
to
me
upon
all
occasions
;
and
I
*NL*
could
do
no
less
than
make
some
return
to
it
,
which
I
did
as
well
as
I
*NL*
could
,
but
it
was
but
in
an
awkward
manner
at
best
,
for
nothing
was
*NL*
more
frightful
to
me
than
his
caresses
,
and
the
apprehensions
of
being
*NL*
with
child
again
by
him
was
ready
to
throw
me
into
fits
;
and
this
made
*NL*
me
see
that
there
was
an
absolute
necessity
of
breaking
the
case
to
him
*NL*
without
any
more
delay
,
which
,
however
,
I
did
with
all
the
caution
and
*NL*
reserve
imaginable
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
continued
his
altered
carriage
to
me
near
a
month
,
and
we
began
*NL*
to
live
a
new
kind
of
life
with
one
another
;
and
could
I
have
satisfied
*NL*
myself
to
have
gone
on
with
it
,
I
believe
it
might
have
continued
as
*NL*
long
as
we
had
continued
alive
together
.
One
evening
,
as
we
were
*NL*
sitting
and
talking
very
friendly
together
under
a
little
awning
,
which
*NL*
served
as
an
arbour
at
the
entrance
from
our
house
into
the
garden
,
he
*NL*
was
in
a
very
pleasant
,
agreeable
humour
,
and
said
abundance
of
kind
*NL*
things
to
me
relating
to
the
pleasure
of
our
present
good
agreement
,
*NL*
and
the
disorders
of
our
past
breach
,
and
what
a
satisfaction
it
was
to
*NL*
him
that
we
had
room
to
hope
we
should
never
have
any
more
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
fetched
a
deep
sigh
,
and
told
him
there
was
nobody
in
the
world
could
*NL*
be
more
delighted
than
I
was
in
the
good
agreement
we
had
always
kept
*NL*
up
,
or
more
afflicted
with
the
breach
of
it
,
and
should
be
so
still
;
*NL*
but
I
was
sorry
to
tell
him
that
there
was
an
unhappy
circumstance
in
*NL*
our
case
,
which
lay
too
close
to
my
heart
,
and
which
I
knew
not
how
to
*NL*
break
to
him
,
that
rendered
my
part
of
it
very
miserable
,
and
took
from
*NL*
me
all
the
comfort
of
the
rest
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
importuned
me
to
tell
him
what
it
was
.
I
told
him
I
could
not
tell
*NL*
how
to
do
it
;
that
while
it
was
concealed
from
him
I
alone
was
unhappy
,
*NL*
but
if
he
knew
it
also
,
we
should
be
both
so
;
and
that
,
therefore
,
to
*NL*
keep
him
in
the
dark
about
it
was
the
kindest
thing
that
I
could
do
,
*NL*
and
it
was
on
that
account
alone
that
I
kept
a
secret
from
him
,
the
*NL*
very
keeping
of
which
,
I
thought
,
would
first
or
last
be
my
destruction
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
impossible
to
express
his
surprise
at
this
relation
,
and
the
*NL*
double
importunity
which
he
used
with
me
to
discover
it
to
him
.
He
*NL*
told
me
I
could
not
be
called
kind
to
him
,
nay
,
I
could
not
be
faithful
*NL*
to
him
if
I
concealed
it
from
him
.
I
told
him
I
thought
so
too
,
and
*NL*
yet
I
could
not
do
it
.
He
went
back
to
what
I
had
said
before
to
him
,
*NL*
and
told
me
he
hoped
it
did
not
relate
to
what
I
had
said
in
my
*NL*
passion
,
and
that
he
had
resolved
to
forget
all
that
as
the
effect
of
a
*NL*
rash
,
provoked
spirit
.
I
told
him
I
wished
I
could
forget
it
all
too
,
*NL*
but
that
it
was
not
to
be
done
,
the
impression
was
too
deep
,
and
I
*NL*
could
not
do
it
:
it
was
impossible
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
then
told
me
he
was
resolved
not
to
differ
with
me
in
anything
,
and
*NL*
that
therefore
he
would
importune
me
no
more
about
it
,
resolving
to
*NL*
acquiesce
in
whatever
I
did
or
said
;
only
begged
I
should
then
agree
,
*NL*
that
whatever
it
was
,
it
should
no
more
interrupt
our
quiet
and
our
*NL*
mutual
kindness
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
most
provoking
thing
he
could
have
said
to
me
,
for
I
*NL*
really
wanted
his
further
importunities
,
that
I
might
be
prevailed
with
*NL*
to
bring
out
that
which
indeed
it
was
like
death
to
me
to
conceal
;
so
I
*NL*
answered
him
plainly
that
I
could
not
say
I
was
glad
not
to
be
*NL*
importuned
,
thought
I
could
not
tell
how
to
comply
.
`
But
come
,
my
*NL*
dear
,
'
said
I
,
`
what
conditions
will
you
make
with
me
upon
the
opening
*NL*
this
affair
to
you
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Any
conditions
in
the
world
,
'
said
he
,
`
that
you
can
in
reason
desire
*NL*
of
me
.
'
`
Well
,
'
said
I
,
`
come
,
give
it
me
under
your
hand
,
that
if
you
*NL*
do
not
find
I
am
in
any
fault
,
or
that
I
am
willingly
concerned
in
the
*NL*
causes
of
the
misfortune
that
is
to
follow
,
you
will
not
blame
me
,
use
*NL*
me
the
worse
,
do
my
any
injury
,
or
make
me
be
the
sufferer
for
that
*NL*
which
is
not
my
fault
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
,
'
says
he
,
`
is
the
most
reasonable
demand
in
the
world
:
not
to
*NL*
blame
you
for
that
which
is
not
your
fault
.
Give
me
a
pen
and
ink
,
'
*NL*
says
he
;
so
I
ran
in
and
fetched
a
pen
,
ink
,
and
paper
,
and
he
wrote
*NL*
the
condition
down
in
the
very
words
I
had
proposed
it
,
and
signed
it
*NL*
with
his
name
.
`
Well
,
'
says
he
,
`
what
is
next
,
my
dear
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
'
says
I
,
`
the
next
is
,
that
you
will
not
blame
me
for
not
*NL*
discovering
the
secret
of
it
to
you
before
I
knew
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Very
just
again
,
'
says
he
;
`
with
all
my
heart
'
;
so
he
wrote
down
that
*NL*
also
,
and
signed
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
my
dear
,
'
says
I
,
`
then
I
have
but
one
condition
more
to
make
*NL*
with
you
,
and
that
is
,
that
as
there
is
nobody
concerned
in
it
but
you
*NL*
and
I
,
you
shall
not
discover
it
to
any
person
in
the
world
,
except
*NL*
your
own
mother
;
and
that
in
all
the
measures
you
shall
take
upon
the
*NL*
discovery
,
as
I
am
equally
concerned
in
it
with
you
,
though
as
innocent
*NL*
as
yourself
,
you
shall
do
nothing
in
a
passion
,
nothing
to
my
prejudice
*NL*
or
to
your
mother
's
prejudice
,
without
my
knowledge
and
consent
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
This
a
little
amazed
him
,
and
he
wrote
down
the
words
distinctly
,
but
*NL*
read
them
over
and
over
before
he
signed
them
,
hesitating
at
them
*NL*
several
times
,
and
repeating
them
:
`
My
mother
's
prejudice
!
and
your
*NL*
prejudice
!
What
mysterious
thing
can
this
be
?
'
However
,
at
last
he
*NL*
signed
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
says
I
,
`
my
dear
,
I
'll
ask
you
no
more
under
your
hand
;
but
as
*NL*
you
are
to
hear
the
most
unexpected
and
surprising
thing
that
perhaps
*NL*
ever
befell
any
family
in
the
world
,
I
beg
you
to
promise
me
you
will
*NL*
receive
it
with
composure
and
a
presence
of
mind
suitable
to
a
man
of
*NL*
sense
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
'll
do
my
utmost
,
'
says
he
,
`
upon
condition
you
will
keep
me
no
*NL*
longer
in
suspense
,
for
you
terrify
me
with
all
these
preliminaries
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
then
,
'
says
I
,
`
it
is
this
:
as
I
told
you
before
in
a
heat
,
that
*NL*
I
was
not
your
lawful
wife
,
and
that
our
children
were
not
legal
*NL*
children
,
so
I
must
let
you
know
now
in
calmness
and
in
kindness
,
but
*NL*
with
affliction
enough
,
that
I
am
your
own
sister
,
and
you
my
own
*NL*
brother
,
and
that
we
are
both
the
children
of
our
mother
now
alive
,
and
*NL*
in
the
house
,
who
is
convinced
of
the
truth
of
it
,
in
a
manner
not
to
*NL*
be
denied
or
contradicted
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
saw
him
turn
pale
and
look
wild
;
and
I
said
,
`
Now
remember
your
*NL*
promise
,
and
receive
it
with
presence
of
mind
;
for
who
could
have
said
*NL*
more
to
prepare
you
for
it
than
I
have
done
?
'
However
,
I
called
a
*NL*
servant
,
and
got
him
a
little
glass
of
rum
-LRB-
which
is
the
usual
dram
of
*NL*
that
country
-RRB-
,
for
he
was
just
fainting
away
.
When
he
was
a
little
*NL*
recovered
,
I
said
to
him
,
`
This
story
,
you
may
be
sure
,
requires
a
long
*NL*
explanation
,
and
therefore
,
have
patience
and
compose
your
mind
to
hear
*NL*
it
out
,
and
I
'll
make
it
as
short
as
I
can
'
;
and
with
this
,
I
told
him
*NL*
what
I
thought
was
needful
of
the
fact
,
and
particularly
how
my
mother
*NL*
came
to
discover
it
to
me
,
as
above
.
`
And
now
,
my
dear
,
'
says
I
,
`
you
*NL*
will
see
reason
for
my
capitulations
,
and
that
I
neither
have
been
the
*NL*
cause
of
this
matter
,
nor
could
be
so
,
and
that
I
could
know
nothing
of
*NL*
it
before
now
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
am
fully
satisfied
of
that
,
'
says
he
,
`
but
't
is
a
dreadful
surprise
*NL*
to
me
;
however
,
I
know
a
remedy
for
it
all
,
and
a
remedy
that
shall
put
*NL*
an
end
to
your
difficulties
,
without
your
going
to
England
.
'
`
That
*NL*
would
be
strange
,
'
said
I
,
`
as
all
the
rest
.
'
`
No
,
no
,
'
says
he
,
`
I
'll
*NL*
make
it
easy
;
there
's
nobody
in
the
way
of
it
but
myself
.
'
He
looked
a
*NL*
little
disordered
when
he
said
this
,
but
I
did
not
apprehend
anything
*NL*
from
it
at
that
time
,
believing
,
as
it
used
to
be
said
,
that
they
who
*NL*
do
those
things
never
talk
of
them
,
or
that
they
who
talk
of
such
*NL*
things
never
do
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
things
were
not
come
to
their
height
with
him
,
and
I
observed
he
*NL*
became
pensive
and
melancholy
;
and
in
a
word
,
as
I
thought
,
a
little
*NL*
distempered
in
his
head
.
I
endeavoured
to
talk
him
into
temper
,
and
to
*NL*
reason
him
into
a
kind
of
scheme
for
our
government
in
the
affair
,
and
*NL*
sometimes
he
would
be
well
,
and
talk
with
some
courage
about
it
;
but
*NL*
the
weight
of
it
lay
too
heavy
upon
his
thoughts
,
and
,
in
short
,
it
*NL*
went
so
far
that
he
made
attempts
upon
himself
,
and
in
one
of
them
had
*NL*
actually
strangled
himself
and
had
not
his
mother
come
into
the
room
in
*NL*
the
very
moment
,
he
had
died
;
but
with
the
help
of
a
Negro
servant
she
*NL*
cut
him
down
and
recovered
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Things
were
now
come
to
a
lamentable
height
in
the
family
.
My
pity
for
*NL*
him
now
began
to
revive
that
affection
which
at
first
I
really
had
for
*NL*
him
,
and
I
endeavoured
sincerely
,
by
all
the
kind
carriage
I
could
,
to
*NL*
make
up
the
breach
;
but
,
in
short
,
it
had
gotten
too
great
a
head
,
it
*NL*
preyed
upon
his
spirits
,
and
it
threw
him
into
a
long
,
lingering
*NL*
consumption
,
though
it
happened
not
to
be
mortal
.
In
this
distress
I
*NL*
did
not
know
what
to
do
,
as
his
life
was
apparently
declining
,
and
I
*NL*
might
perhaps
have
married
again
there
,
very
much
to
my
advantage
;
it
*NL*
had
been
certainly
my
business
to
have
stayed
in
the
country
,
but
my
*NL*
mind
was
restless
too
,
and
uneasy
;
I
hankered
after
coming
to
England
,
*NL*
and
nothing
would
satisfy
me
without
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
short
,
by
an
unwearied
importunity
,
my
husband
,
who
was
apparently
*NL*
decaying
,
as
I
observed
,
was
at
last
prevailed
with
;
and
so
my
own
fate
*NL*
pushing
me
on
,
the
way
was
made
clear
for
me
,
and
my
mother
concurring
,
*NL*
I
obtained
a
very
good
cargo
for
my
coming
to
England
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
parted
with
my
brother
-LRB-
for
such
I
am
now
to
call
him
-RRB-
,
we
*NL*
agreed
that
after
I
arrived
he
should
pretend
to
have
an
account
that
I
*NL*
was
dead
in
England
,
and
so
might
marry
again
when
he
would
.
He
*NL*
promised
,
and
engaged
to
me
to
correspond
with
me
as
a
sister
,
and
to
*NL*
assist
and
support
me
as
long
as
I
lived
;
and
that
if
he
died
before
*NL*
me
,
he
would
leave
sufficient
to
his
mother
to
take
care
of
me
still
,
*NL*
in
the
name
of
a
sister
,
and
he
was
in
some
respects
careful
of
me
,
*NL*
when
he
heard
of
me
;
but
it
was
so
oddly
managed
that
I
felt
the
*NL*
disappointments
very
sensibly
afterwards
,
as
you
shall
hear
in
its
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
came
away
for
England
in
the
month
of
August
,
after
I
had
been
eight
*NL*
years
in
that
country
;
and
now
a
new
scene
of
misfortunes
attended
me
,
*NL*
which
perhaps
few
women
have
gone
through
the
life
of
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
an
indifferent
good
voyage
till
we
came
just
upon
the
coast
of
*NL*
England
,
and
where
we
arrived
in
two-and-thirty
days
,
but
were
then
*NL*
ruffled
with
two
or
three
storms
,
one
of
which
drove
us
away
to
the
*NL*
coast
of
Ireland
,
and
we
put
in
at
Kinsdale
.
We
remained
there
about
*NL*
thirteen
days
,
got
some
refreshment
on
shore
,
and
put
to
sea
again
,
*NL*
though
we
met
with
very
bad
weather
again
,
in
which
the
ship
sprung
her
*NL*
mainmast
,
as
they
called
it
,
for
I
knew
not
what
they
meant
.
But
we
*NL*
got
at
last
into
Milford
Haven
,
in
Wales
,
where
,
though
it
was
remote
*NL*
from
our
port
,
yet
having
my
foot
safe
upon
the
firm
ground
of
my
*NL*
native
country
,
the
isle
of
Britain
,
I
resolved
to
venture
it
no
more
*NL*
upon
the
waters
,
which
had
been
so
terrible
to
me
;
so
getting
my
*NL*
clothes
and
money
on
shore
,
with
my
bills
of
loading
and
other
papers
,
*NL*
I
resolved
to
come
for
London
,
and
leave
the
ship
to
get
to
her
port
as
*NL*
she
could
;
the
port
whither
she
was
bound
was
to
Bristol
,
where
my
*NL*
brother
's
chief
correspondent
lived
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
got
to
London
in
about
three
weeks
,
where
I
heard
a
little
while
*NL*
after
that
the
ship
was
arrived
in
Bristol
,
but
at
the
same
time
had
*NL*
the
misfortune
to
know
that
by
the
violent
weather
she
had
been
in
,
and
*NL*
the
breaking
of
her
mainmast
,
she
had
great
damage
on
board
,
and
that
a
*NL*
great
part
of
her
cargo
was
spoiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
now
a
new
scene
of
life
upon
my
hands
,
and
a
dreadful
appearance
*NL*
it
had
.
I
was
come
away
with
a
kind
of
final
farewell
.
What
I
brought
*NL*
with
me
was
indeed
considerable
,
had
it
come
safe
,
and
by
the
help
of
*NL*
it
,
I
might
have
married
again
tolerably
well
;
but
as
it
was
,
I
was
*NL*
reduced
to
between
two
or
three
hundred
pounds
in
the
whole
,
and
this
*NL*
without
any
hope
of
recruit
.
I
was
entirely
without
friends
,
nay
,
even
*NL*
so
much
as
without
acquaintance
,
for
I
found
it
was
absolutely
*NL*
necessary
not
to
revive
former
acquaintances
;
and
as
for
my
subtle
*NL*
friend
that
set
me
up
formerly
for
a
fortune
,
she
was
dead
,
and
her
*NL*
husband
also
;
as
I
was
informed
,
upon
sending
a
person
unknown
to
*NL*
inquire
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
looking
after
my
cargo
of
goods
soon
after
obliged
me
to
take
a
*NL*
journey
to
Bristol
,
and
during
my
attendance
upon
that
affair
I
took
*NL*
the
diversion
of
going
to
the
Bath
,
for
as
I
was
still
far
from
being
*NL*
old
,
so
my
humour
,
which
was
always
gay
,
continued
so
to
an
extreme
;
*NL*
and
being
now
,
as
it
were
,
a
woman
of
fortune
though
I
was
a
woman
*NL*
without
a
fortune
,
I
expected
something
or
other
might
happen
in
my
way
*NL*
that
might
mend
my
circumstances
,
as
had
been
my
case
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Bath
is
a
place
of
gallantry
enough
;
expensive
,
and
full
of
snares
.
*NL*
I
went
thither
,
indeed
,
in
the
view
of
taking
anything
that
might
*NL*
offer
,
but
I
must
do
myself
justice
,
as
to
protest
I
knew
nothing
*NL*
amiss
;
I
meant
nothing
but
in
an
honest
way
,
nor
had
I
any
thoughts
*NL*
about
me
at
first
that
looked
the
way
which
afterwards
I
suffered
them
*NL*
to
be
guided
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
I
stayed
the
whole
latter
season
,
as
it
is
called
there
,
and
*NL*
contracted
some
unhappy
acquaintances
,
which
rather
prompted
the
*NL*
follies
I
fell
afterwards
into
than
fortified
me
against
them
.
I
lived
*NL*
pleasantly
enough
,
kept
good
company
,
that
is
to
say
,
gay
,
fine
*NL*
company
;
but
had
the
discouragement
to
find
this
way
of
living
sunk
me
*NL*
exceedingly
,
and
that
as
I
had
no
settled
income
,
so
spending
upon
the
*NL*
main
stock
was
but
a
certain
kind
of
bleeding
to
death
;
and
this
gave
*NL*
me
many
sad
reflections
in
the
interval
of
my
other
thoughts
.
However
,
*NL*
I
shook
them
off
,
and
still
flattered
myself
that
something
or
other
*NL*
might
offer
for
my
advantage
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
was
in
the
wrong
place
for
it
.
I
was
not
now
at
Redriff
,
where
,
*NL*
if
I
had
set
myself
tolerably
up
,
some
honest
sea
captain
or
other
*NL*
might
have
talked
with
me
upon
the
honourable
terms
of
matrimony
;
but
I
*NL*
was
at
the
Bath
,
where
men
find
a
mistress
sometimes
,
but
very
rarely
*NL*
look
for
a
wife
;
and
consequently
all
the
particular
acquaintances
a
*NL*
woman
can
expect
to
make
there
must
have
some
tendency
that
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
spent
the
first
season
well
enough
;
for
though
I
had
contracted
*NL*
some
acquaintance
with
a
gentleman
who
came
to
the
Bath
for
his
*NL*
diversion
,
yet
I
had
entered
into
no
felonious
treaty
,
as
it
might
be
*NL*
called
.
I
had
resisted
some
casual
offers
of
gallantry
,
and
had
*NL*
managed
that
way
well
enough
.
I
was
not
wicked
enough
to
come
into
the
*NL*
crime
for
the
mere
vice
of
it
,
and
I
had
no
extraordinary
offers
made
*NL*
me
that
tempted
me
with
the
main
thing
which
I
wanted
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
I
went
this
length
the
first
season
,
viz
.
I
contracted
an
*NL*
acquaintance
with
a
woman
in
whose
house
I
lodged
,
who
,
though
she
did
*NL*
not
keep
an
ill
house
,
as
we
call
it
,
yet
had
none
of
the
best
*NL*
principles
in
herself
.
I
had
on
all
occasions
behaved
myself
so
well
*NL*
as
not
to
get
the
least
slur
upon
my
reputation
on
any
account
*NL*
whatever
,
and
all
the
men
that
I
had
conversed
with
were
of
so
good
*NL*
reputation
that
I
had
not
given
the
least
reflection
by
conversing
with
*NL*
them
;
nor
did
any
of
them
seem
to
think
there
was
room
for
a
wicked
*NL*
correspondence
,
if
they
had
any
of
them
offered
it
;
yet
there
was
one
*NL*
gentleman
,
as
above
,
who
always
singled
me
out
for
the
diversion
of
my
*NL*
company
,
as
he
called
it
,
which
,
as
he
was
pleased
to
say
,
was
very
*NL*
agreeable
to
him
,
but
at
that
time
there
was
no
more
in
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
many
melancholy
hours
at
the
Bath
after
the
company
was
gone
;
for
*NL*
though
I
went
to
Bristol
sometime
for
the
disposing
my
effects
,
and
for
*NL*
recruits
of
money
,
yet
I
chose
to
come
back
to
Bath
for
my
residence
,
*NL*
because
being
on
good
terms
with
the
woman
in
whose
house
I
lodged
in
*NL*
the
summer
,
I
found
that
during
the
winter
I
lived
rather
cheaper
there
*NL*
than
I
could
do
anywhere
else
.
Here
,
I
say
,
I
passed
the
winter
as
*NL*
heavily
as
I
had
passed
the
autumn
cheerfully
;
but
having
contracted
a
*NL*
nearer
intimacy
with
the
said
woman
in
whose
house
I
lodged
,
I
could
*NL*
not
avoid
communicating
to
her
something
of
what
lay
hardest
upon
my
*NL*
mind
and
particularly
the
narrowness
of
my
circumstances
,
and
the
loss
*NL*
of
my
fortune
by
the
damage
of
my
goods
at
sea
.
I
told
her
also
,
that
*NL*
I
had
a
mother
and
a
brother
in
Virginia
in
good
circumstances
;
and
as
*NL*
I
had
really
written
back
to
my
mother
in
particular
to
represent
my
*NL*
condition
,
and
the
great
loss
I
had
received
,
which
indeed
came
to
*NL*
almost
#
500
,
so
I
did
not
fail
to
let
my
new
friend
know
that
I
*NL*
expected
a
supply
from
thence
,
and
so
indeed
I
did
;
and
as
the
ships
*NL*
went
from
Bristol
to
York
River
,
in
Virginia
,
and
back
again
generally
*NL*
in
less
time
from
London
,
and
that
my
brother
corresponded
chiefly
at
*NL*
Bristol
,
I
thought
it
was
much
better
for
me
to
wait
here
for
my
*NL*
returns
than
to
go
to
London
,
where
also
I
had
not
the
least
*NL*
acquaintance
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
new
friend
appeared
sensibly
affected
with
my
condition
,
and
indeed
*NL*
was
so
very
kind
as
to
reduce
the
rate
of
my
living
with
her
to
so
low
*NL*
a
price
during
the
winter
,
that
she
convinced
me
she
got
nothing
by
me
;
*NL*
and
as
for
lodging
,
during
the
winter
I
paid
nothing
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
spring
season
came
on
,
she
continued
to
be
as
kind
to
me
as
*NL*
she
could
,
and
I
lodged
with
her
for
a
time
,
till
it
was
found
*NL*
necessary
to
do
otherwise
.
She
had
some
persons
of
character
that
*NL*
frequently
lodged
in
her
house
,
and
in
particular
the
gentleman
who
,
as
*NL*
I
said
,
singled
me
out
for
his
companion
the
winter
before
;
and
he
came
*NL*
down
again
with
another
gentleman
in
his
company
and
two
servants
,
and
*NL*
lodged
in
the
same
house
.
I
suspected
that
my
landlady
had
invited
him
*NL*
thither
,
letting
him
know
that
I
was
still
with
her
;
but
she
denied
it
,
*NL*
and
protested
to
me
that
she
did
not
,
and
he
said
the
same
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
word
,
this
gentleman
came
down
and
continued
to
single
me
out
for
*NL*
his
peculiar
confidence
as
well
as
conversation
.
He
was
a
complete
*NL*
gentleman
,
that
must
be
confessed
,
and
his
company
was
very
agreeable
*NL*
to
me
,
as
mine
,
if
I
might
believe
him
,
was
to
him
.
He
made
no
*NL*
professions
to
be
but
of
an
extraordinary
respect
,
and
he
had
such
an
*NL*
opinion
of
my
virtue
,
that
,
as
he
often
professed
,
he
believed
if
he
*NL*
should
offer
anything
else
,
I
should
reject
him
with
contempt
.
He
soon
*NL*
understood
from
me
that
I
was
a
widow
;
that
I
had
arrived
at
Bristol
*NL*
from
Virginia
by
the
last
ships
;
and
that
I
waited
at
Bath
till
the
*NL*
next
Virginia
fleet
should
arrive
,
by
which
I
expected
considerable
*NL*
effects
.
I
understood
by
him
,
and
by
others
of
him
,
that
he
had
a
*NL*
wife
,
but
that
the
lady
was
distempered
in
her
head
,
and
was
under
the
*NL*
conduct
of
her
own
relations
,
which
he
consented
to
,
to
avoid
any
*NL*
reflections
that
might
-LRB-
as
was
not
unusual
in
such
cases
-RRB-
be
cast
on
*NL*
him
for
mismanaging
her
cure
;
and
in
the
meantime
he
came
to
the
Bath
*NL*
to
divert
his
thoughts
from
the
disturbance
of
such
a
melancholy
*NL*
circumstance
as
that
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
landlady
,
who
of
her
own
accord
encouraged
the
correspondence
on
all
*NL*
occasions
,
gave
me
an
advantageous
character
of
him
,
as
a
man
of
honour
*NL*
and
of
virtue
,
as
well
as
of
great
estate
.
And
indeed
I
had
a
great
*NL*
deal
of
reason
to
say
so
of
him
too
;
for
though
we
lodged
both
on
a
*NL*
floor
,
and
he
had
frequently
come
into
my
chamber
,
even
when
I
was
in
*NL*
bed
,
and
I
also
into
his
when
he
was
in
bed
,
yet
he
never
offered
*NL*
anything
to
me
further
than
a
kiss
,
or
so
much
as
solicited
me
to
*NL*
anything
till
long
after
,
as
you
shall
hear
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
frequently
took
notice
to
my
landlady
of
his
exceeding
modesty
,
and
*NL*
she
again
used
to
tell
me
,
she
believed
it
was
so
from
the
beginning
;
*NL*
however
,
she
used
to
tell
me
that
she
thought
I
ought
to
expect
some
*NL*
gratification
from
him
for
my
company
,
for
indeed
he
did
,
as
it
were
,
*NL*
engross
me
,
and
I
was
seldom
from
him
.
I
told
her
I
had
not
given
him
*NL*
the
least
occasion
to
think
I
wanted
it
,
or
that
I
would
accept
of
it
*NL*
from
him
.
She
told
me
she
would
take
that
part
upon
her
,
and
she
did
*NL*
so
,
and
managed
it
so
dexterously
,
that
the
first
time
we
were
together
*NL*
alone
,
after
she
had
talked
with
him
,
he
began
to
inquire
a
little
into
*NL*
my
circumstances
,
as
how
I
had
subsisted
myself
since
I
came
on
shore
,
*NL*
and
whether
I
did
not
want
money
.
I
stood
off
very
boldly
.
I
told
him
*NL*
that
though
my
cargo
of
tobacco
was
damaged
,
yet
that
it
was
not
quite
*NL*
lost
;
that
the
merchant
I
had
been
consigned
to
had
so
honestly
managed
*NL*
for
me
that
I
had
not
wanted
,
and
that
I
hoped
,
with
frugal
management
,
*NL*
I
should
make
it
hold
out
till
more
would
come
,
which
I
expected
by
the
*NL*
next
fleet
;
that
in
the
meantime
I
had
retrenched
my
expenses
,
and
*NL*
whereas
I
kept
a
maid
last
season
,
now
I
lived
without
;
and
whereas
I
*NL*
had
a
chamber
and
a
dining-room
then
on
the
first
floor
,
as
he
knew
,
I
*NL*
now
had
but
one
room
,
two
pair
of
stairs
,
and
the
like
.
`
But
I
live
,
'
*NL*
said
I
,
`
as
well
satisfied
now
as
I
did
then
'
;
adding
,
that
his
company
*NL*
had
been
a
means
to
make
me
live
much
more
cheerfully
than
otherwise
I
*NL*
should
have
done
,
for
which
I
was
much
obliged
to
him
;
and
so
I
put
off
*NL*
all
room
for
any
offer
for
the
present
.
However
,
it
was
not
long
*NL*
before
he
attacked
me
again
,
and
told
me
he
found
that
I
was
backward
*NL*
to
trust
him
with
the
secret
of
my
circumstances
,
which
he
was
sorry
*NL*
for
;
assuring
me
that
he
inquired
into
it
with
no
design
to
satisfy
his
*NL*
own
curiosity
,
but
merely
to
assist
me
,
if
there
was
any
occasion
;
but
*NL*
since
I
would
not
own
myself
to
stand
in
need
of
any
assistance
,
he
had
*NL*
but
one
thing
more
to
desire
of
me
,
and
that
was
,
that
I
would
promise
*NL*
him
that
when
I
was
any
way
straitened
,
or
like
to
be
so
,
I
would
*NL*
frankly
tell
him
of
it
,
and
that
I
would
make
use
of
him
with
the
same
*NL*
freedom
that
he
made
the
offer
;
adding
,
that
I
should
always
find
I
had
*NL*
a
true
friend
,
though
perhaps
I
was
afraid
to
trust
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
omitted
nothing
that
was
fit
to
be
said
by
one
infinitely
obliged
,
to
*NL*
let
him
know
that
I
had
a
due
sense
of
his
kindness
;
and
indeed
from
*NL*
that
time
I
did
not
appear
so
much
reserved
to
him
as
I
had
done
*NL*
before
,
though
still
within
the
bounds
of
the
strictest
virtue
on
both
*NL*
sides
;
but
how
free
soever
our
conversation
was
,
I
could
not
arrive
to
*NL*
that
sort
of
freedom
which
he
desired
,
viz
.
to
tell
him
I
wanted
money
,
*NL*
though
I
was
secretly
very
glad
of
his
offer
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
weeks
passed
after
this
,
and
still
I
never
asked
him
for
money
;
*NL*
when
my
landlady
,
a
cunning
creature
,
who
had
often
pressed
me
to
it
,
*NL*
but
found
that
I
could
not
do
it
,
makes
a
story
of
her
own
inventing
,
*NL*
and
comes
in
bluntly
to
me
when
we
were
together
.
`
Oh
,
widow
!
'
says
*NL*
she
,
'
I
have
bad
news
to
tell
you
this
morning
.
'
`
What
is
that
?
'
said
*NL*
I
;
`
are
the
Virginia
ships
taken
by
the
French
?
'
--
for
that
was
my
fear
.
*NL*
`
No
,
no
,
'
says
she
,
`
but
the
man
you
sent
to
Bristol
yesterday
for
*NL*
money
is
come
back
,
and
says
he
has
brought
none
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Now
I
could
by
no
means
like
her
project
;
I
though
it
looked
too
much
*NL*
like
prompting
him
,
which
indeed
he
did
not
want
,
and
I
clearly
saw
*NL*
that
I
should
lose
nothing
by
being
backward
to
ask
,
so
I
took
her
up
*NL*
short
.
'
I
ca
n't
image
why
he
should
say
so
to
you
,
'
said
I
,
`
for
I
*NL*
assure
you
he
brought
me
all
the
money
I
sent
him
for
,
and
here
it
is
,
'
*NL*
said
I
-LRB-
pulling
out
my
purse
with
about
twelve
guineas
in
it
-RRB-
;
and
*NL*
added
,
'
I
intend
you
shall
have
most
of
it
by
and
by
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
seemed
distasted
a
little
at
her
talking
as
she
did
at
first
,
as
*NL*
well
as
I
,
taking
it
,
as
I
fancied
he
would
,
as
something
forward
of
*NL*
her
;
but
when
he
saw
me
give
such
an
answer
,
he
came
immediately
to
*NL*
himself
again
.
The
next
morning
we
talked
of
it
again
,
when
I
found
he
*NL*
was
fully
satisfied
,
and
,
smiling
,
said
he
hoped
I
would
not
want
money
*NL*
and
not
tell
him
of
it
,
and
that
I
had
promised
him
otherwise
.
I
told
*NL*
him
I
had
been
very
much
dissatisfied
at
my
landlady
's
talking
so
*NL*
publicly
the
day
before
of
what
she
had
nothing
to
do
with
;
but
I
*NL*
supposed
she
wanted
what
I
owed
her
,
which
was
about
eight
guineas
,
*NL*
which
I
had
resolved
to
give
her
,
and
had
accordingly
given
it
her
the
*NL*
same
night
she
talked
so
foolishly
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
in
a
might
good
humour
when
he
heard
me
say
I
had
paid
her
,
and
*NL*
it
went
off
into
some
other
discourse
at
that
time
.
But
the
next
*NL*
morning
,
he
having
heard
me
up
about
my
room
before
him
,
he
called
to
*NL*
me
,
and
I
answering
,
he
asked
me
to
come
into
his
chamber
.
He
was
in
*NL*
bed
when
I
came
in
,
and
he
made
me
come
and
sit
down
on
his
bedside
,
*NL*
for
he
said
he
had
something
to
say
to
me
which
was
of
some
moment
.
*NL*
After
some
very
kind
expressions
,
he
asked
me
if
I
would
be
very
honest
*NL*
to
him
,
and
give
a
sincere
answer
to
one
thing
he
would
desire
of
me
.
*NL*
After
some
little
cavil
at
the
word
`
sincere
,
'
and
asking
him
if
I
had
*NL*
ever
given
him
any
answers
which
were
not
sincere
,
I
promised
him
I
*NL*
would
.
Why
,
then
,
his
request
was
,
he
said
,
to
let
him
see
my
purse
.
*NL*
I
immediately
put
my
hand
into
my
pocket
,
and
,
laughing
to
him
,
pulled
*NL*
it
out
,
and
there
was
in
it
three
guineas
and
a
half
.
Then
he
asked
me
*NL*
if
there
was
all
the
money
I
had
.
I
told
him
No
,
laughing
again
,
not
*NL*
by
a
great
deal
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
then
,
he
said
,
he
would
have
me
promise
to
go
and
fetch
him
all
*NL*
the
money
I
had
,
every
farthing
.
I
told
him
I
would
,
and
I
went
into
*NL*
my
chamber
and
fetched
him
a
little
private
drawer
,
where
I
had
about
*NL*
six
guineas
more
,
and
some
silver
,
and
threw
it
all
down
upon
the
bed
,
*NL*
and
told
him
there
was
all
my
wealth
,
honestly
to
a
shilling
.
He
*NL*
looked
a
little
at
it
,
but
did
not
tell
it
,
and
huddled
it
all
into
the
*NL*
drawer
again
,
and
then
reaching
his
pocket
,
pulled
out
a
key
,
and
bade
*NL*
me
open
a
little
walnut-tree
box
he
had
upon
the
table
,
and
bring
him
*NL*
such
a
drawer
,
which
I
did
.
In
which
drawer
there
was
a
great
deal
of
*NL*
money
in
gold
,
I
believe
near
two
hundred
guineas
,
but
I
knew
not
how
*NL*
much
.
He
took
the
drawer
,
and
taking
my
hand
,
made
me
put
it
in
and
*NL*
take
a
whole
handful
.
I
was
backward
at
that
,
but
he
held
my
hand
hard
*NL*
in
his
hand
,
and
put
it
into
the
drawer
,
and
made
me
take
out
as
many
*NL*
guineas
almost
as
I
could
well
take
up
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
had
done
so
,
he
made
me
put
them
into
my
lap
,
and
took
my
little
*NL*
drawer
,
and
poured
out
all
my
money
among
his
,
and
bade
me
get
me
gone
,
*NL*
and
carry
it
all
home
into
my
own
chamber
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
relate
this
story
the
more
particularly
because
of
the
good-humour
*NL*
there
was
in
it
,
and
to
show
the
temper
with
which
we
conversed
.
It
*NL*
was
not
long
after
this
but
he
began
every
day
to
find
fault
with
my
*NL*
clothes
,
with
my
laces
and
headdresses
,
and
,
in
a
word
,
pressed
me
to
*NL*
buy
better
;
which
,
by
the
way
,
I
was
willing
enough
to
do
,
though
I
did
*NL*
not
seem
to
be
so
,
for
I
loved
nothing
in
the
world
better
than
fine
*NL*
clothes
.
I
told
him
I
must
housewife
the
money
he
had
lent
me
,
or
else
*NL*
I
should
not
be
able
to
pay
him
again
.
He
then
told
me
,
in
a
few
*NL*
words
,
that
as
he
had
a
sincere
respect
for
me
,
and
knew
my
*NL*
circumstances
,
he
had
not
lent
me
that
money
,
but
given
it
me
,
and
that
*NL*
he
thought
I
had
merited
it
from
him
by
giving
him
my
company
so
*NL*
entirely
as
I
had
done
.
After
this
he
made
me
take
a
maid
,
and
keep
*NL*
house
,
and
his
friend
that
come
with
him
to
Bath
being
gone
,
he
obliged
*NL*
me
to
diet
him
,
which
I
did
very
willingly
,
believing
,
as
it
appeared
,
*NL*
that
I
should
lose
nothing
by
it
,
nor
did
the
woman
of
the
house
fail
*NL*
to
find
her
account
in
it
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
lived
thus
near
three
months
,
when
the
company
beginning
to
wear
*NL*
away
at
the
Bath
,
he
talked
of
going
away
,
and
fain
he
would
have
me
to
*NL*
go
to
London
with
him
.
I
was
not
very
easy
in
that
proposal
,
not
*NL*
knowing
what
posture
I
was
to
live
in
there
,
or
how
he
might
use
me
.
*NL*
But
while
this
was
in
debate
he
fell
very
sick
;
he
had
gone
out
to
a
*NL*
place
in
Somersetshire
,
called
Shepton
,
where
he
had
some
business
and
*NL*
was
there
taken
very
ill
,
and
so
ill
that
he
could
not
travel
;
so
he
*NL*
sent
his
man
back
to
Bath
,
to
beg
me
that
I
would
hire
a
coach
and
come
*NL*
over
to
him
.
Before
he
went
,
he
had
left
all
his
money
and
other
*NL*
things
of
value
with
me
,
and
what
to
do
with
them
I
did
not
know
,
but
I
*NL*
secured
them
as
well
as
I
could
,
and
locked
up
the
lodgings
and
went
to
*NL*
him
,
where
I
found
him
very
ill
indeed
;
however
,
I
persuaded
him
to
be
*NL*
carried
in
a
litter
to
the
Bath
,
where
there
was
more
help
and
better
*NL*
advice
to
be
had
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
consented
,
and
I
brought
him
to
the
Bath
,
which
was
about
fifteen
*NL*
miles
,
as
I
remember
.
Here
he
continued
very
ill
of
a
fever
,
and
kept
*NL*
his
bed
five
weeks
,
all
which
time
I
nursed
him
and
tended
him
myself
,
*NL*
as
much
and
as
carefully
as
if
I
had
been
his
wife
;
indeed
,
if
I
had
*NL*
been
his
wife
I
could
not
have
done
more
.
I
sat
up
with
him
so
much
*NL*
and
so
often
,
that
at
last
,
indeed
,
he
would
not
let
me
sit
up
any
*NL*
longer
,
and
then
I
got
a
pallet-bed
into
his
room
,
and
lay
in
it
just
*NL*
at
his
bed
's
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
indeed
sensibly
affected
with
his
condition
,
and
with
the
*NL*
apprehension
of
losing
such
a
friend
as
he
was
,
and
was
like
to
be
to
*NL*
me
,
and
I
used
to
sit
and
cry
by
him
many
hours
together
.
However
,
at
*NL*
last
he
grew
better
,
and
gave
hopes
that
he
would
recover
,
as
indeed
he
*NL*
did
,
though
very
slowly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Were
it
otherwise
than
what
I
am
going
to
say
,
I
should
not
be
backward
*NL*
to
disclose
it
,
as
it
is
apparent
I
have
done
in
other
cases
in
this
*NL*
account
;
but
I
affirm
,
that
through
all
this
conversation
,
abating
the
*NL*
freedom
of
coming
into
the
chamber
when
I
or
he
was
in
bed
,
and
abating
*NL*
the
necessary
offices
of
attending
him
night
and
day
when
he
was
sick
,
*NL*
there
had
not
passed
the
least
immodest
word
or
action
between
us
.
Oh
*NL*
that
it
had
been
so
to
the
last
!
*NL*
*NL*
After
some
time
he
gathered
strength
and
grew
well
apace
,
and
I
would
*NL*
have
removed
my
pallet-bed
,
but
he
would
not
let
me
,
till
he
was
able
*NL*
to
venture
himself
without
anybody
to
sit
up
with
him
,
and
then
I
*NL*
removed
to
my
own
chamber
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
many
occasions
to
express
his
sense
of
my
tenderness
and
*NL*
concern
for
him
;
and
when
he
grew
quite
well
,
he
made
me
a
present
of
*NL*
fifty
guineas
for
my
care
and
,
as
he
called
it
,
for
hazarding
my
life
*NL*
to
save
his
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
he
made
deep
protestations
of
a
sincere
inviolable
affection
*NL*
for
me
,
but
all
along
attested
it
to
be
with
the
utmost
reserve
for
my
*NL*
virtue
and
his
own
.
I
told
him
I
was
fully
satisfied
of
it
.
He
*NL*
carried
it
that
length
that
he
protested
to
me
,
that
if
he
was
naked
in
*NL*
bed
with
me
,
he
would
as
sacredly
preserve
my
virtue
as
he
would
defend
*NL*
it
if
I
was
assaulted
by
a
ravisher
.
I
believed
him
,
and
told
him
I
*NL*
did
so
;
but
this
did
not
satisfy
him
,
he
would
,
he
said
,
wait
for
some
*NL*
opportunity
to
give
me
an
undoubted
testimony
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
great
while
after
this
that
I
had
occasion
,
on
my
own
*NL*
business
,
to
go
to
Bristol
,
upon
which
he
hired
me
a
coach
,
and
would
*NL*
go
with
me
,
and
did
so
;
and
now
indeed
our
intimacy
increased
.
From
*NL*
Bristol
he
carried
me
to
Gloucester
,
which
was
merely
a
journey
of
*NL*
pleasure
,
to
take
the
air
;
and
here
it
was
our
hap
to
have
no
lodging
*NL*
in
the
inn
but
in
one
large
chamber
with
two
beds
in
it
.
The
master
of
*NL*
the
house
going
up
with
us
to
show
his
rooms
,
and
coming
into
that
*NL*
room
,
said
very
frankly
to
him
,
`
Sir
,
it
is
none
of
my
business
to
*NL*
inquire
whether
the
lady
be
your
spouse
or
no
,
but
if
not
,
you
may
lie
*NL*
as
honestly
in
these
two
beds
as
if
you
were
in
two
chambers
,
'
and
with
*NL*
that
he
pulls
a
great
curtain
which
drew
quite
across
the
room
and
*NL*
effectually
divided
the
beds
.
`
Well
,
'
says
my
friend
,
very
readily
,
*NL*
`
these
beds
will
do
,
and
as
for
the
rest
,
we
are
too
near
akin
to
lie
*NL*
together
,
though
we
may
lodge
near
one
another
'
;
and
this
put
an
honest
*NL*
face
on
the
thing
too
.
When
we
came
to
go
to
bed
,
he
decently
went
out
*NL*
of
the
room
till
I
was
in
bed
,
and
then
went
to
bed
in
the
bed
on
his
*NL*
own
side
of
the
room
,
but
lay
there
talking
to
me
a
great
while
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
,
repeating
his
usual
saying
,
that
he
could
lie
naked
in
the
bed
*NL*
with
me
and
not
offer
me
the
least
injury
,
he
starts
out
of
his
bed
.
*NL*
`
And
now
,
my
dear
,
'
says
he
,
`
you
shall
see
how
just
I
will
be
to
you
,
*NL*
and
that
I
can
keep
my
word
,
'
and
away
he
comes
to
my
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
resisted
a
little
,
but
I
must
confess
I
should
not
have
resisted
him
*NL*
much
if
he
had
not
made
those
promises
at
all
;
so
after
a
little
*NL*
struggle
,
as
I
said
,
I
lay
still
and
let
him
come
to
bed
.
When
he
was
*NL*
there
he
took
me
in
his
arms
,
and
so
I
lay
all
night
with
him
,
but
he
*NL*
had
no
more
to
do
with
me
,
or
offered
anything
to
me
,
other
than
*NL*
embracing
me
,
as
I
say
,
in
his
arms
,
no
,
not
the
whole
night
,
but
rose
*NL*
up
and
dressed
him
in
the
morning
,
and
left
me
as
innocent
for
him
as
I
*NL*
was
the
day
I
was
born
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
a
surprising
thing
to
me
,
and
perhaps
may
be
so
to
others
,
who
*NL*
know
how
the
laws
of
nature
work
;
for
he
was
a
strong
,
vigorous
,
brisk
*NL*
person
;
nor
did
he
act
thus
on
a
principle
of
religion
at
all
,
but
of
*NL*
mere
affection
;
insisting
on
it
,
that
though
I
was
to
him
to
most
*NL*
agreeable
woman
in
the
world
,
yet
,
because
he
loved
me
,
he
could
not
*NL*
injure
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
own
it
was
a
noble
principle
,
but
as
it
was
what
I
never
understood
*NL*
before
,
so
it
was
to
me
perfectly
amazing
.
We
traveled
the
rest
of
the
*NL*
journey
as
we
did
before
,
and
came
back
to
the
Bath
,
where
,
as
he
had
*NL*
opportunity
to
come
to
me
when
he
would
,
he
often
repeated
the
*NL*
moderation
,
and
I
frequently
lay
with
him
,
and
he
with
me
,
and
although
*NL*
all
the
familiarities
between
man
and
wife
were
common
to
us
,
yet
he
*NL*
never
once
offered
to
go
any
farther
,
and
he
valued
himself
much
upon
*NL*
it
.
I
do
not
say
that
I
was
so
wholly
pleased
with
it
as
he
thought
I
*NL*
was
,
for
I
own
much
wickeder
than
he
,
as
you
shall
hear
presently
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
lived
thus
near
two
years
,
only
with
this
exception
,
that
he
went
*NL*
three
times
to
London
in
that
time
,
and
once
he
continued
there
four
*NL*
months
;
but
,
to
do
him
justice
,
he
always
supplied
me
with
money
to
*NL*
subsist
me
very
handsomely
.
*NL*
*NL*
Had
we
continued
thus
,
I
confess
we
had
had
much
to
boast
of
;
but
as
*NL*
wise
men
say
,
it
is
ill
venturing
too
near
the
brink
of
a
command
,
so
*NL*
we
found
it
;
and
here
again
I
must
do
him
the
justice
to
own
that
the
*NL*
first
breach
was
not
on
his
part
.
It
was
one
night
that
we
were
in
bed
*NL*
together
warm
and
merry
,
and
having
drunk
,
I
think
,
a
little
more
wine
*NL*
that
night
,
both
of
us
,
than
usual
,
although
not
in
the
least
to
*NL*
disorder
either
of
us
,
when
,
after
some
other
follies
which
I
can
not
*NL*
name
,
and
being
clasped
close
in
his
arms
,
I
told
him
-LRB-
I
repeat
it
with
*NL*
shame
and
horror
of
soul
-RRB-
that
I
could
find
in
my
heart
to
discharge
*NL*
him
of
his
engagement
for
one
night
and
no
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
me
at
my
word
immediately
,
and
after
that
there
was
no
*NL*
resisting
him
;
neither
indeed
had
I
any
mind
to
resist
him
any
more
,
*NL*
let
what
would
come
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
the
government
of
our
virtue
was
broken
,
and
I
exchanged
the
place
*NL*
of
friend
for
that
unmusical
,
harsh-sounding
title
of
whore
.
In
the
*NL*
morning
we
were
both
at
our
penitentials
;
I
cried
very
heartily
,
he
*NL*
expressed
himself
very
sorry
;
but
that
was
all
either
of
us
could
do
at
*NL*
that
time
,
and
the
way
being
thus
cleared
,
and
the
bars
of
virtue
and
*NL*
conscience
thus
removed
,
we
had
the
less
difficult
afterwards
to
*NL*
struggle
with
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
but
a
dull
kind
of
conversation
that
we
had
together
for
all
the
*NL*
rest
of
that
week
;
I
looked
on
him
with
blushes
,
and
every
now
and
then
*NL*
started
that
melancholy
objection
,
`
What
if
I
should
be
with
child
now
?
*NL*
What
will
become
of
me
then
?
'
He
encouraged
me
by
telling
me
,
that
as
*NL*
long
as
I
was
true
to
him
,
he
would
be
so
to
me
;
and
since
it
was
gone
*NL*
such
a
length
-LRB-
which
indeed
he
never
intended
-RRB-
,
yet
if
I
was
with
*NL*
child
,
he
would
take
care
of
that
,
and
of
me
too
.
This
hardened
us
*NL*
both
.
I
assured
him
if
I
was
with
child
,
I
would
die
for
want
of
a
*NL*
midwife
rather
than
name
him
as
the
father
of
it
;
and
he
assured
me
I
*NL*
should
never
want
if
I
should
be
with
child
.
These
mutual
assurances
*NL*
hardened
us
in
the
thing
,
and
after
this
we
repeated
the
crime
as
often
*NL*
as
we
pleased
,
till
at
length
,
as
I
had
feared
,
so
it
came
to
pass
,
and
*NL*
I
was
indeed
with
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
I
was
sure
it
was
so
,
and
I
had
satisfied
him
of
it
too
,
we
began
*NL*
to
think
of
taking
measures
for
the
managing
it
,
and
I
proposed
*NL*
trusting
the
secret
to
my
landlady
,
and
asking
her
advice
,
which
he
*NL*
agreed
to
.
My
landlady
,
a
woman
-LRB-
as
I
found
-RRB-
used
to
such
things
,
made
*NL*
light
of
it
;
she
said
she
knew
it
would
come
to
that
at
last
,
and
made
*NL*
us
very
merry
about
it
.
As
I
said
above
,
we
found
her
an
experienced
*NL*
old
lady
at
such
work
;
she
undertook
everything
,
engaged
to
procure
a
*NL*
midwife
and
a
nurse
,
to
satisfy
all
inquiries
,
and
bring
us
off
with
*NL*
reputation
,
and
she
did
so
very
dexterously
indeed
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
grew
near
my
time
she
desired
my
gentleman
to
go
away
to
London
,
*NL*
or
make
as
if
he
did
so
.
When
he
was
gone
,
she
acquainted
the
parish
*NL*
officers
that
there
was
a
lady
ready
to
lie
in
at
her
house
,
but
that
*NL*
she
knew
her
husband
very
well
,
and
gave
them
,
as
she
pretended
,
an
*NL*
account
of
his
name
,
which
she
called
Sir
Walter
Cleve
;
telling
them
he
*NL*
was
a
very
worthy
gentleman
,
and
that
she
would
answer
for
all
*NL*
inquiries
,
and
the
like
.
This
satisfied
the
parish
officers
presently
,
*NL*
and
I
lay
in
with
as
much
credit
as
I
could
have
done
if
I
had
really
*NL*
been
my
Lady
Cleve
,
and
was
assisted
in
my
travail
by
three
or
four
of
*NL*
the
best
citizens
'
wives
of
Bath
who
lived
in
the
neighbourhood
,
which
,
*NL*
however
,
made
me
a
little
the
more
expensive
to
him
.
I
often
expressed
*NL*
my
concern
to
him
about
it
,
but
he
bid
me
not
be
concerned
at
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
had
furnished
me
very
sufficiently
with
money
for
the
*NL*
extraordinary
expenses
of
my
lying
in
,
I
had
everything
very
handsome
*NL*
about
me
,
but
did
not
affect
to
be
gay
or
extravagant
neither
;
besides
,
*NL*
knowing
my
own
circumstances
,
and
knowing
the
world
as
I
had
done
,
and
*NL*
that
such
kind
of
things
do
not
often
last
long
,
I
took
care
to
lay
up
*NL*
as
much
money
as
I
could
for
a
wet
day
,
as
I
called
it
;
making
him
*NL*
believe
it
was
all
spent
upon
the
extraordinary
appearance
of
things
in
*NL*
my
lying
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
this
means
,
and
including
what
he
had
given
me
as
above
,
I
had
at
*NL*
the
end
of
my
lying
in
about
two
hundred
guineas
by
me
,
including
also
*NL*
what
was
left
of
my
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
brought
to
bed
of
a
fine
boy
indeed
,
and
a
charming
child
it
was
;
*NL*
and
when
he
heard
of
it
he
wrote
me
a
very
kind
,
obliging
letter
about
*NL*
it
,
and
then
told
me
,
he
thought
it
would
look
better
for
me
to
come
*NL*
away
for
London
as
soon
as
I
was
up
and
well
;
that
he
had
provided
*NL*
apartments
for
me
at
Hammersmith
,
as
if
I
came
thither
only
from
*NL*
London
;
and
that
after
a
little
while
I
should
go
back
to
the
Bath
,
and
*NL*
he
would
go
with
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
liked
this
offer
very
well
,
and
accordingly
hired
a
coach
on
purpose
,
*NL*
and
taking
my
child
,
and
a
wet-nurse
to
tend
and
suckle
it
,
and
a
*NL*
maid-servant
with
me
,
away
I
went
for
London
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
met
me
at
Reading
in
his
own
chariot
,
and
taking
me
into
that
,
left
*NL*
the
servant
and
the
child
in
the
hired
coach
,
and
so
he
brought
me
to
*NL*
my
new
lodgings
at
Hammersmith
;
with
which
I
had
abundance
of
reason
to
*NL*
be
very
well
pleased
,
for
they
were
very
handsome
rooms
,
and
I
was
very
*NL*
well
accommodated
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
I
was
indeed
in
the
height
of
what
I
might
call
my
prosperity
,
*NL*
and
I
wanted
nothing
but
to
be
a
wife
,
which
,
however
,
could
not
be
in
*NL*
this
case
,
there
was
no
room
for
it
;
and
therefore
on
all
occasions
I
*NL*
studied
to
save
what
I
could
,
as
I
have
said
above
,
against
a
time
of
*NL*
scarcity
,
knowing
well
enough
that
such
things
as
these
do
not
always
*NL*
continue
;
that
men
that
keep
mistresses
often
change
them
,
grow
weary
*NL*
of
them
,
or
jealous
of
them
,
or
something
or
other
happens
to
make
them
*NL*
withdraw
their
bounty
;
and
sometimes
the
ladies
that
are
thus
well
used
*NL*
are
not
careful
by
a
prudent
conduct
to
preserve
the
esteem
of
their
*NL*
persons
,
or
the
nice
article
of
their
fidelity
,
and
then
they
are
*NL*
justly
cast
off
with
contempt
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
was
secured
in
this
point
,
for
as
I
had
no
inclination
to
change
,
*NL*
so
I
had
no
manner
of
acquaintance
in
the
whole
house
,
and
so
no
*NL*
temptation
to
look
any
farther
.
I
kept
no
company
but
in
the
family
*NL*
when
I
lodged
,
and
with
the
clergyman
's
lady
at
next
door
;
so
that
when
*NL*
he
was
absent
I
visited
nobody
,
nor
did
he
ever
find
me
out
of
my
*NL*
chamber
or
parlour
whenever
he
came
down
;
if
I
went
anywhere
to
take
*NL*
the
air
,
it
was
always
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
living
in
this
manner
with
him
,
and
his
with
me
,
was
certainly
the
*NL*
most
undesigned
thing
in
the
world
;
he
often
protested
to
me
,
that
when
*NL*
he
became
first
acquainted
with
me
,
and
even
to
the
very
night
when
we
*NL*
first
broke
in
upon
our
rules
,
he
never
had
the
least
design
of
lying
*NL*
with
me
;
that
he
always
had
a
sincere
affection
for
me
,
but
not
the
*NL*
least
real
inclination
to
do
what
he
had
done
.
I
assured
him
I
never
*NL*
suspected
him
;
that
if
I
had
I
should
not
so
easily
have
yielded
to
the
*NL*
freedom
which
brought
it
on
,
but
that
it
was
all
a
surprise
,
and
was
*NL*
owing
to
the
accident
of
our
having
yielded
too
far
to
our
mutual
*NL*
inclinations
that
night
;
and
indeed
I
have
often
observed
since
,
and
*NL*
leave
it
as
a
caution
to
the
readers
of
this
story
,
that
we
ought
to
be
*NL*
cautious
of
gratifying
our
inclinations
in
loose
and
lewd
freedoms
,
*NL*
lest
we
find
our
resolutions
of
virtue
fail
us
in
the
junction
when
*NL*
their
assistance
should
be
most
necessary
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
true
,
and
I
have
confessed
it
before
,
that
from
the
first
hour
I
*NL*
began
to
converse
with
him
,
I
resolved
to
let
him
lie
with
me
,
if
he
*NL*
offered
it
;
but
it
was
because
I
wanted
his
help
and
assistance
,
and
I
*NL*
knew
no
other
way
of
securing
him
than
that
.
But
when
were
that
night
*NL*
together
,
and
,
as
I
have
said
,
had
gone
such
a
length
,
I
found
my
*NL*
weakness
;
the
inclination
was
not
to
be
resisted
,
but
I
was
obliged
to
*NL*
yield
up
all
even
before
he
asked
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
he
was
so
just
to
me
that
he
never
upbraided
me
with
that
;
nor
*NL*
did
he
ever
express
the
least
dislike
of
my
conduct
on
any
other
*NL*
occasion
,
but
always
protested
he
was
as
much
delighted
with
my
company
*NL*
as
he
was
the
first
hour
we
came
together
:
I
mean
,
came
together
as
*NL*
bedfellows
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
true
that
he
had
no
wife
,
that
is
to
say
,
she
was
as
no
wife
to
*NL*
him
,
and
so
I
was
in
no
danger
that
way
,
but
the
just
reflections
of
*NL*
conscience
oftentimes
snatch
a
man
,
especially
a
man
of
sense
,
from
the
*NL*
arms
of
a
mistress
,
as
it
did
him
at
last
,
though
on
another
occasion
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
other
hand
,
though
I
was
not
without
secret
reproaches
of
my
own
*NL*
conscience
for
the
life
I
led
,
and
that
even
in
the
greatest
height
of
*NL*
the
satisfaction
I
ever
took
,
yet
I
had
the
terrible
prospect
of
*NL*
poverty
and
starving
,
which
lay
on
me
as
a
frightful
spectre
,
so
that
*NL*
there
was
no
looking
behind
me
.
But
as
poverty
brought
me
into
it
,
so
*NL*
fear
of
poverty
kept
me
in
it
,
and
I
frequently
resolved
to
leave
it
*NL*
quite
off
,
if
I
could
but
come
to
lay
up
money
enough
to
maintain
me
.
*NL*
But
these
were
thoughts
of
no
weight
,
and
whenever
he
came
to
me
they
*NL*
vanished
;
for
his
company
was
so
delightful
,
that
there
was
no
being
*NL*
melancholy
when
he
was
there
;
the
reflections
were
all
the
subject
of
*NL*
those
hours
when
I
was
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
lived
six
years
in
this
happy
but
unhappy
condition
,
in
which
time
I
*NL*
brought
him
three
children
,
but
only
the
first
of
them
lived
;
and
*NL*
though
I
removed
twice
in
those
six
years
,
yet
I
came
back
the
sixth
*NL*
year
to
my
first
lodgings
at
Hammersmith
.
Here
it
was
that
I
was
one
*NL*
morning
surprised
with
a
kind
but
melancholy
letter
from
my
gentleman
,
*NL*
intimating
that
he
was
very
ill
,
and
was
afraid
he
should
have
another
*NL*
fit
of
sickness
,
but
that
his
wife
's
relations
being
in
the
house
with
*NL*
him
,
it
would
not
be
practicable
to
have
me
with
him
,
which
,
however
,
*NL*
he
expressed
his
great
dissatisfaction
in
,
and
that
he
wished
I
could
*NL*
be
allowed
to
tend
and
nurse
him
as
I
did
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
very
much
concerned
at
this
account
,
and
was
very
impatient
to
*NL*
know
how
it
was
with
him
.
I
waited
a
fortnight
or
thereabouts
,
and
*NL*
heard
nothing
,
which
surprised
me
,
and
I
began
to
be
very
uneasy
*NL*
indeed
.
I
think
,
I
may
say
,
that
for
the
next
fortnight
I
was
near
to
*NL*
distracted
.
It
was
my
particular
difficulty
that
I
did
not
know
*NL*
directly
where
he
was
;
for
I
understood
at
first
he
was
in
the
lodgings
*NL*
of
his
wife
's
mother
;
but
having
removed
myself
to
London
,
I
soon
*NL*
found
,
by
the
help
of
the
direction
I
had
for
writing
my
letters
to
*NL*
him
,
how
to
inquire
after
him
,
and
there
I
found
that
he
was
at
a
house
*NL*
in
Bloomsbury
,
whither
he
had
,
a
little
before
he
fell
sick
,
removed
*NL*
his
whole
family
;
and
that
his
wife
and
wife
's
mother
were
in
the
same
*NL*
house
,
though
the
wife
was
not
suffered
to
know
that
she
was
in
the
*NL*
same
house
with
her
husband
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
I
also
soon
understood
that
he
was
at
the
last
extremity
,
which
*NL*
made
me
almost
at
the
last
extremity
too
,
to
have
a
true
account
.
One
*NL*
night
I
had
the
curiosity
to
disguise
myself
like
a
servant-maid
,
in
a
*NL*
round
cap
and
straw
hat
,
and
went
to
the
door
,
as
sent
by
a
lady
of
his
*NL*
neighbourhood
,
where
he
lived
before
,
and
giving
master
and
mistress
's
*NL*
service
,
I
said
I
was
sent
to
know
how
Mr.
--
did
,
and
how
he
had
*NL*
rested
that
night
.
In
delivering
this
message
I
got
the
opportunity
I
*NL*
desired
;
for
,
speaking
with
one
of
the
maids
,
I
held
a
long
gossip
's
*NL*
tale
with
her
,
and
had
all
the
particulars
of
his
illness
,
which
I
*NL*
found
was
a
pleurisy
,
attended
with
a
cough
and
a
fever
.
She
told
me
*NL*
also
who
was
in
the
house
,
and
how
his
wife
was
,
who
,
by
her
relation
,
*NL*
they
were
in
some
hopes
might
recover
her
understanding
;
but
as
to
the
*NL*
gentleman
himself
,
in
short
she
told
me
the
doctors
said
there
was
very
*NL*
little
hopes
of
him
,
that
in
the
morning
they
thought
he
had
been
*NL*
dying
,
and
that
he
was
but
little
better
then
,
for
they
did
not
expect
*NL*
that
he
could
live
over
the
next
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
heavy
news
for
me
,
and
I
began
now
to
see
an
end
of
my
*NL*
prosperity
,
and
to
see
also
that
it
was
very
well
I
had
played
to
good
*NL*
housewife
,
and
secured
or
saved
something
while
he
was
alive
,
for
that
*NL*
now
I
had
no
view
of
my
own
living
before
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
lay
very
heavy
upon
my
mind
,
too
,
that
I
had
a
son
,
a
fine
lovely
*NL*
boy
,
about
five
years
old
,
and
no
provision
made
for
it
,
at
least
that
*NL*
I
knew
of
.
With
these
considerations
,
and
a
sad
heart
,
I
went
home
*NL*
that
evening
,
and
began
to
cast
with
myself
how
I
should
live
,
and
in
*NL*
what
manner
to
bestow
myself
,
for
the
residue
of
my
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
You
may
be
sure
I
could
not
rest
without
inquiring
again
very
quickly
*NL*
what
was
become
of
him
;
and
not
venturing
to
go
myself
,
I
sent
several
*NL*
sham
messengers
,
till
after
a
fortnight
's
waiting
longer
,
I
found
that
*NL*
there
was
hopes
of
his
life
,
though
he
was
still
very
ill
;
then
I
*NL*
abated
my
sending
any
more
to
the
house
,
and
in
some
time
after
I
*NL*
learned
in
the
neighbourhood
that
he
was
about
house
,
and
then
that
he
*NL*
was
abroad
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
made
no
doubt
then
but
that
I
should
soon
hear
of
him
,
and
began
to
*NL*
comfort
myself
with
my
circumstances
being
,
as
I
thought
,
recovered
.
I
*NL*
waited
a
week
,
and
two
weeks
,
and
with
much
surprise
and
amazement
I
*NL*
waited
near
two
months
and
heard
nothing
,
but
that
,
being
recovered
,
he
*NL*
was
gone
into
the
country
for
the
air
,
and
for
the
better
recovery
*NL*
after
his
distemper
.
After
this
it
was
yet
two
months
more
,
and
then
I
*NL*
understood
he
was
come
to
his
city
house
again
,
but
still
I
heard
*NL*
nothing
from
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
written
several
letters
for
him
,
and
directed
them
as
usual
,
and
*NL*
found
two
or
three
of
them
had
been
called
for
,
but
not
the
rest
.
I
*NL*
wrote
again
in
a
more
pressing
manner
than
ever
,
and
in
one
of
them
let
*NL*
him
know
,
that
I
must
be
forced
to
wait
on
him
myself
,
representing
my
*NL*
circumstances
,
the
rent
of
lodgings
to
pay
,
and
the
provision
for
the
*NL*
child
wanting
,
and
my
own
deplorable
condition
,
destitute
of
*NL*
subsistence
for
his
most
solemn
engagement
to
take
care
of
and
provide
*NL*
for
me
.
I
took
a
copy
of
this
letter
,
and
finding
it
lay
at
the
house
*NL*
near
a
month
and
was
not
called
for
,
I
found
means
to
have
the
copy
of
*NL*
it
put
into
his
own
hands
at
a
coffee-house
,
where
I
had
by
inquiry
*NL*
found
he
used
to
go
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
letter
forced
an
answer
from
him
,
by
which
,
though
I
found
I
was
*NL*
to
be
abandoned
,
yet
I
found
he
had
sent
a
letter
to
me
some
time
*NL*
before
,
desiring
me
to
go
down
to
the
Bath
again
.
Its
contents
I
shall
*NL*
come
to
presently
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
true
that
sick-beds
are
the
time
when
such
correspondences
as
*NL*
this
are
looked
on
with
different
countenances
,
and
seen
with
other
*NL*
eyes
than
we
saw
them
with
,
or
than
they
appeared
with
before
.
My
*NL*
lover
had
been
at
the
gates
of
death
,
and
at
the
very
brink
of
*NL*
eternity
;
and
,
it
seems
,
had
been
struck
with
a
due
remorse
,
and
with
*NL*
sad
reflections
upon
his
past
life
of
gallantry
and
levity
;
and
among
*NL*
the
rest
,
criminal
correspondence
with
me
,
which
was
neither
more
nor
*NL*
less
than
a
long-continued
life
of
adultery
,
and
represented
itself
as
*NL*
it
really
was
,
not
as
it
had
been
formerly
thought
by
him
to
be
,
and
he
*NL*
looked
upon
it
now
with
a
just
and
religious
abhorrence
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
can
not
but
observe
also
,
and
leave
it
for
the
direction
of
my
sex
in
*NL*
such
cases
of
pleasure
,
that
whenever
sincere
repentance
succeeds
such
*NL*
a
crime
as
this
,
there
never
fails
to
attend
a
hatred
of
the
object
;
*NL*
and
the
more
the
affection
might
seem
to
be
before
,
the
hatred
will
be
*NL*
the
more
in
proportion
.
It
will
always
be
so
,
indeed
it
can
be
no
*NL*
otherwise
;
for
there
can
not
be
a
true
and
sincere
abhorrence
of
the
*NL*
offence
,
and
the
love
to
the
cause
of
it
remain
;
there
will
,
with
an
*NL*
abhorrence
of
the
sin
,
be
found
a
detestation
of
the
fellow-sinner
;
you
*NL*
can
expect
no
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
found
it
so
here
,
though
good
manners
and
justice
in
this
gentleman
*NL*
kept
him
from
carrying
it
on
to
any
extreme
but
the
short
history
of
*NL*
his
part
in
this
affair
was
thus
:
he
perceived
by
my
last
letter
,
and
*NL*
by
all
the
rest
,
which
he
went
for
after
,
that
I
was
not
gone
to
Bath
,
*NL*
that
his
first
letter
had
not
come
to
my
hand
;
upon
which
he
write
me
*NL*
this
following
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
`
MADAM
,
--
I
am
surprised
that
my
letter
,
dated
the
8th
of
last
month
,
*NL*
did
not
come
to
your
hand
;
I
give
you
my
word
it
was
delivered
at
your
*NL*
lodgings
,
and
to
the
hands
of
your
maid
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
need
not
acquaint
you
with
what
has
been
my
condition
for
some
time
*NL*
past
;
and
how
,
having
been
at
the
edge
of
the
grave
,
I
am
,
by
the
*NL*
unexpected
and
undeserved
mercy
of
Heaven
,
restored
again
.
In
the
*NL*
condition
I
have
been
in
,
it
can
not
be
strange
to
you
that
our
unhappy
*NL*
correspondence
had
not
been
the
least
of
the
burthens
which
lay
upon
my
*NL*
conscience
.
I
need
say
no
more
;
those
things
that
must
be
repented
of
,
*NL*
must
be
also
reformed
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
wish
you
would
think
of
going
back
to
the
Bath
.
I
enclose
you
here
a
*NL*
bill
for
#
50
for
clearing
yourself
at
your
lodgings
,
and
carrying
you
*NL*
down
,
and
hope
it
will
be
no
surprise
to
you
to
add
,
that
on
this
*NL*
account
only
,
and
not
for
any
offence
given
me
on
your
side
,
I
can
see
*NL*
you
no
more
.
I
will
take
due
care
of
the
child
;
leave
him
where
he
is
,
*NL*
or
take
him
with
you
,
as
you
please
.
I
wish
you
the
like
reflections
,
*NL*
and
that
they
may
be
to
your
advantage
.
--
I
am
,
'
etc.
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
struck
with
this
letter
as
with
a
thousand
wounds
,
such
as
I
*NL*
can
not
describe
;
the
reproaches
of
my
own
conscience
were
such
as
I
*NL*
can
not
express
,
for
I
was
not
blind
to
my
own
crime
;
and
I
reflected
*NL*
that
I
might
with
less
offence
have
continued
with
my
brother
,
and
*NL*
lived
with
him
as
a
wife
,
since
there
was
no
crime
in
our
marriage
on
*NL*
that
score
,
neither
of
us
knowing
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
never
once
reflected
that
I
was
all
this
while
a
married
woman
,
a
*NL*
wife
to
Mr.
--
the
linen-draper
,
who
,
though
he
had
left
me
by
the
*NL*
necessity
of
his
circumstances
,
had
no
power
to
discharge
me
from
the
*NL*
marriage
contract
which
was
between
us
,
or
to
give
me
a
legal
liberty
*NL*
to
marry
again
;
so
that
I
had
been
no
less
than
a
whore
and
an
*NL*
adulteress
all
this
while
.
I
then
reproached
myself
with
the
liberties
*NL*
I
had
taken
,
and
how
I
had
been
a
snare
to
this
gentleman
,
and
that
*NL*
indeed
I
was
principal
in
the
crime
;
that
now
he
was
mercifully
*NL*
snatched
out
of
the
gulf
by
a
convincing
work
upon
his
mind
,
but
that
I
*NL*
was
left
as
if
I
was
forsaken
of
God
's
grace
,
and
abandoned
by
Heaven
*NL*
to
a
continuing
in
my
wickedness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Under
these
reflections
I
continued
very
pensive
and
sad
for
near
*NL*
month
,
and
did
not
go
down
to
the
Bath
,
having
no
inclination
to
be
*NL*
with
the
woman
whom
I
was
with
before
;
lest
,
as
I
thought
,
she
should
*NL*
prompt
me
to
some
wicked
course
of
life
again
,
as
she
had
done
;
and
*NL*
besides
,
I
was
very
loth
she
should
know
I
was
cast
off
as
above
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
I
was
greatly
perplexed
about
my
little
boy
.
It
was
death
to
*NL*
me
to
part
with
the
child
,
and
yet
when
I
considered
the
danger
of
*NL*
being
one
time
or
other
left
with
him
to
keep
without
a
maintenance
to
*NL*
support
him
,
I
then
resolved
to
leave
him
where
he
was
;
but
then
I
*NL*
concluded
also
to
be
near
him
myself
too
,
that
I
then
might
have
the
*NL*
satisfaction
of
seeing
him
,
without
the
care
of
providing
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
sent
my
gentleman
a
short
letter
,
therefore
,
that
I
had
obeyed
his
*NL*
orders
in
all
things
but
that
of
going
back
to
the
Bath
,
which
I
could
*NL*
not
think
of
for
many
reasons
;
that
however
parting
from
him
was
a
*NL*
wound
to
me
that
I
could
never
recover
,
yet
that
I
was
fully
satisfied
*NL*
his
reflections
were
just
,
and
would
be
very
far
from
desiring
to
*NL*
obstruct
his
reformation
or
repentance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
I
represented
my
own
circumstances
to
him
in
the
most
moving
terms
*NL*
that
I
was
able
.
I
told
him
that
those
unhappy
distresses
which
first
*NL*
moved
him
to
a
generous
and
an
honest
friendship
for
me
,
would
,
I
hope
,
*NL*
move
him
to
a
little
concern
for
me
now
,
though
the
criminal
part
of
*NL*
our
correspondence
,
which
I
believed
neither
of
us
intended
to
fall
*NL*
into
at
the
time
,
was
broken
off
;
that
I
desired
to
repent
as
sincerely
*NL*
as
he
had
done
,
but
entreated
him
to
put
me
in
some
condition
that
I
*NL*
might
not
be
exposed
to
the
temptations
which
the
devil
never
fails
to
*NL*
excite
us
to
from
the
frightful
prospect
of
poverty
and
distress
;
and
*NL*
if
he
had
the
least
apprehensions
of
my
being
troublesome
to
him
,
I
*NL*
begged
he
would
put
me
in
a
posture
to
go
back
to
my
mother
in
*NL*
Virginia
,
from
when
he
knew
I
came
,
and
that
would
put
an
end
to
all
*NL*
his
fears
on
that
account
.
I
concluded
,
that
if
he
would
send
me
#
50
*NL*
more
to
facilitate
my
going
away
,
I
would
send
him
back
a
general
*NL*
release
,
and
would
promise
never
to
disturb
him
more
with
any
*NL*
importunities
;
unless
it
was
to
hear
of
the
well-doing
of
the
child
,
*NL*
whom
,
if
I
found
my
mother
living
and
my
circumstances
able
,
I
would
*NL*
send
for
to
come
over
to
me
,
and
take
him
also
effectually
off
his
*NL*
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
indeed
all
a
cheat
thus
far
,
viz
.
that
I
had
no
intention
to
*NL*
go
to
Virginia
,
as
the
account
of
my
former
affairs
there
may
convince
*NL*
anybody
of
;
but
the
business
was
to
get
this
last
#
50
of
him
,
if
*NL*
possible
,
knowing
well
enough
it
would
be
the
last
penny
I
was
ever
to
*NL*
expect
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
the
argument
I
used
,
namely
,
of
giving
him
a
general
release
,
*NL*
and
never
troubling
him
any
more
,
prevailed
effectually
with
him
,
and
*NL*
he
sent
me
a
bill
for
the
money
by
a
person
who
brought
with
him
a
*NL*
general
release
for
me
to
sign
,
and
which
I
frankly
signed
,
and
*NL*
received
the
money
;
and
thus
,
though
full
sore
against
my
will
,
a
final
*NL*
end
was
put
to
this
affair
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
here
I
can
not
but
reflect
upon
the
unhappy
consequence
of
too
great
*NL*
freedoms
between
persons
stated
as
we
were
,
upon
the
pretence
of
*NL*
innocent
intentions
,
love
of
friendship
,
and
the
like
;
for
the
flesh
*NL*
has
generally
so
great
a
share
in
those
friendships
,
that
is
great
odds
*NL*
but
inclination
prevails
at
last
over
the
most
solemn
resolutions
;
and
*NL*
that
vice
breaks
in
at
the
breaches
of
decency
,
which
really
innocent
*NL*
friendship
ought
to
preserve
with
the
greatest
strictness
.
But
I
leave
*NL*
the
readers
of
these
things
to
their
own
just
reflections
,
which
they
*NL*
will
be
more
able
to
make
effectual
than
I
,
who
so
soon
forgot
myself
,
*NL*
and
am
therefore
but
a
very
indifferent
monitor
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
now
a
single
person
again
,
as
I
may
call
myself
;
I
was
loosed
*NL*
from
all
the
obligations
either
of
wedlock
or
mistress-ship
in
the
*NL*
world
,
except
my
husband
the
linen-draper
,
whom
,
I
having
not
now
heard
*NL*
from
in
almost
fifteen
years
,
nobody
could
blame
me
for
thinking
myself
*NL*
entirely
freed
from
;
seeing
also
he
had
at
his
going
away
told
me
,
that
*NL*
if
I
did
not
hear
frequently
from
him
,
I
should
conclude
he
was
dead
,
*NL*
and
I
might
freely
marry
again
to
whom
I
pleased
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
now
began
to
cast
up
my
accounts
.
I
had
by
many
letters
and
much
*NL*
importunity
,
and
with
the
intercession
of
my
mother
too
,
had
a
second
*NL*
return
of
some
goods
from
my
brother
-LRB-
as
I
now
call
him
-RRB-
in
Virginia
,
*NL*
to
make
up
the
damage
of
the
cargo
I
brought
away
with
me
,
and
this
too
*NL*
was
upon
the
condition
of
my
sealing
a
general
release
to
him
,
and
to
*NL*
send
it
him
by
his
correspondent
at
Bristol
,
which
,
though
I
thought
*NL*
hard
of
,
yet
I
was
obliged
to
promise
to
do
.
However
,
I
managed
so
*NL*
well
in
this
case
,
that
I
got
my
goods
away
before
the
release
was
*NL*
signed
,
and
then
I
always
found
something
or
other
to
say
to
evade
the
*NL*
thing
,
and
to
put
off
the
signing
it
at
all
;
till
at
length
I
pretended
*NL*
I
must
write
to
my
brother
,
and
have
his
answer
,
before
I
could
do
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Including
this
recruit
,
and
before
I
got
the
last
#
50
,
I
found
my
*NL*
strength
to
amount
,
put
all
together
,
to
about
#
400
,
so
that
with
that
*NL*
I
had
about
#
450
.
I
had
saved
above
#
100
more
,
but
I
met
with
a
*NL*
disaster
with
that
,
which
was
this
--
that
a
goldsmith
in
whose
hands
I
*NL*
had
trusted
it
,
broke
,
so
I
lost
#
70
of
my
money
,
the
man
's
composition
*NL*
not
making
above
#
30
out
of
his
#
100
.
I
had
a
little
plate
,
but
not
*NL*
much
,
and
was
well
enough
stocked
with
clothes
and
linen
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
this
stock
I
had
the
world
to
begin
again
;
but
you
are
to
consider
*NL*
that
I
was
not
now
the
same
woman
as
when
I
lived
at
Redriff
;
for
,
*NL*
first
of
all
,
I
was
near
twenty
years
older
,
and
did
not
look
the
*NL*
better
for
my
age
,
nor
for
my
rambles
to
Virginia
and
back
again
;
and
*NL*
though
I
omitted
nothing
that
might
set
me
out
to
advantage
,
except
*NL*
painting
,
for
that
I
never
stooped
to
,
and
had
pride
enough
to
think
I
*NL*
did
not
want
it
,
yet
there
would
always
be
some
difference
seen
between
*NL*
five-and-twenty
and
two-and-forty
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
cast
about
innumerable
ways
for
my
future
state
of
life
,
and
began
to
*NL*
consider
very
seriously
what
I
should
do
,
but
nothing
offered
.
I
took
*NL*
care
to
make
the
world
take
me
for
something
more
than
I
was
,
and
had
*NL*
it
given
out
that
I
was
a
fortune
,
and
that
my
estate
was
in
my
own
*NL*
hands
;
the
last
of
which
was
very
true
,
the
first
of
it
was
as
above
.
*NL*
I
had
no
acquaintance
,
which
was
one
of
my
worst
misfortunes
,
and
the
*NL*
consequence
of
that
was
,
I
had
no
adviser
,
at
least
who
could
assist
*NL*
and
advise
together
;
and
above
all
,
I
had
nobody
to
whom
I
could
in
*NL*
confidence
commit
the
secret
of
my
circumstances
to
,
and
could
depend
*NL*
upon
for
their
secrecy
and
fidelity
;
and
I
found
by
experience
,
that
to
*NL*
be
friendless
is
the
worst
condition
,
next
to
being
in
want
that
a
*NL*
woman
can
be
reduced
to
:
I
say
a
woman
,
because
't
is
evident
men
can
*NL*
be
their
own
advisers
,
and
their
own
directors
,
and
know
how
to
work
*NL*
themselves
out
of
difficulties
and
into
business
better
than
women
;
but
*NL*
if
a
woman
has
no
friend
to
communicate
her
affairs
to
,
and
to
advise
*NL*
and
assist
her
,
't
is
ten
to
one
but
she
is
undone
;
nay
,
and
the
more
*NL*
money
she
has
,
the
more
danger
she
is
in
of
being
wronged
and
deceived
;
*NL*
and
this
was
my
case
in
the
affair
of
the
#
100
which
I
left
in
the
*NL*
hands
of
the
goldsmith
,
as
above
,
whose
credit
,
it
seems
,
was
upon
the
*NL*
ebb
before
,
but
I
,
that
had
no
knowledge
of
things
and
nobody
to
*NL*
consult
with
,
knew
nothing
of
it
,
and
so
lost
my
money
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
next
place
,
when
a
woman
is
thus
left
desolate
and
void
of
*NL*
counsel
,
she
is
just
like
a
bag
of
money
or
a
jewel
dropped
on
the
*NL*
highway
,
which
is
a
prey
to
the
next
comer
;
if
a
man
of
virtue
and
*NL*
upright
principles
happens
to
find
it
,
he
will
have
it
cried
,
and
the
*NL*
owner
may
come
to
hear
of
it
again
;
but
how
many
times
shall
such
a
*NL*
thing
fall
into
hands
that
will
make
no
scruple
of
seizing
it
for
their
*NL*
own
,
to
once
that
it
shall
come
into
good
hands
?
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
evidently
my
case
,
for
I
was
now
a
loose
,
unguided
creature
,
*NL*
and
had
no
help
,
no
assistance
,
no
guide
for
my
conduct
;
I
knew
what
I
*NL*
aimed
at
and
what
I
wanted
,
but
knew
nothing
how
to
pursue
the
end
by
*NL*
direct
means
.
I
wanted
to
be
placed
in
a
settle
state
of
living
,
and
*NL*
had
I
happened
to
meet
with
a
sober
,
good
husband
,
I
should
have
been
*NL*
as
faithful
and
true
a
wife
to
him
as
virtue
itself
could
have
formed
.
*NL*
If
I
had
been
otherwise
,
the
vice
came
in
always
at
the
door
of
*NL*
necessity
,
not
at
the
door
of
inclination
;
and
I
understood
too
well
,
*NL*
by
the
want
of
it
,
what
the
value
of
a
settled
life
was
,
to
do
anything
*NL*
to
forfeit
the
felicity
of
it
;
nay
,
I
should
have
made
the
better
wife
*NL*
for
all
the
difficulties
I
had
passed
through
,
by
a
great
deal
;
nor
did
*NL*
I
in
any
of
the
time
that
I
had
been
a
wife
give
my
husbands
the
least
*NL*
uneasiness
on
account
of
my
behaviour
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
all
this
was
nothing
;
I
found
no
encouraging
prospect
.
I
waited
;
I
*NL*
lived
regularly
,
and
with
as
much
frugality
as
became
my
circumstances
,
*NL*
but
nothing
offered
,
nothing
presented
,
and
the
main
stock
wasted
*NL*
apace
.
What
to
do
I
knew
not
;
the
terror
of
approaching
poverty
lay
*NL*
hard
upon
my
spirits
.
I
had
some
money
,
but
where
to
place
it
I
knew
*NL*
not
,
nor
would
the
interest
of
it
maintain
me
,
at
least
not
in
London
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
a
new
scene
opened
.
There
was
in
the
house
where
I
lodged
a
*NL*
north-country
woman
that
went
for
a
gentlewoman
,
and
nothing
was
more
*NL*
frequent
in
her
discourse
than
her
account
of
the
cheapness
of
*NL*
provisions
,
and
the
easy
way
of
living
in
her
country
;
how
plentiful
*NL*
and
how
cheap
everything
was
,
what
good
company
they
kept
,
and
the
*NL*
like
;
till
at
last
I
told
her
she
almost
tempted
me
to
go
and
live
in
*NL*
her
country
;
for
I
that
was
a
widow
,
though
I
had
sufficient
to
live
*NL*
on
,
yet
had
no
way
of
increasing
it
;
and
that
I
found
I
could
not
live
*NL*
here
under
#
100
a
year
,
unless
I
kept
no
company
,
no
servant
,
made
no
*NL*
appearance
,
and
buried
myself
in
privacy
,
as
if
I
was
obliged
to
it
by
*NL*
necessity
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
should
have
observed
,
that
she
was
always
made
to
believe
,
as
*NL*
everybody
else
was
,
that
I
was
a
great
fortune
,
or
at
least
that
I
had
*NL*
three
or
four
thousand
pounds
,
if
not
more
,
and
all
in
my
own
hands
;
*NL*
and
she
was
mighty
sweet
upon
me
when
she
thought
me
inclined
in
the
*NL*
least
to
go
into
her
country
.
She
said
she
had
a
sister
lived
near
*NL*
Liverpool
,
that
her
brother
was
a
considerable
gentleman
there
,
and
had
*NL*
a
great
estate
also
in
Ireland
;
that
she
would
go
down
there
in
about
*NL*
two
months
,
and
if
I
would
give
her
my
company
thither
,
I
should
be
as
*NL*
welcome
as
herself
for
a
month
or
more
as
I
pleased
,
till
I
should
see
*NL*
how
I
liked
the
country
;
and
if
I
thought
fit
to
live
there
,
she
would
*NL*
undertake
they
would
take
care
,
though
they
did
not
entertain
lodgers
*NL*
themselves
,
they
would
recommend
me
to
some
agreeable
family
,
where
I
*NL*
should
be
placed
to
my
content
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
this
woman
had
known
my
real
circumstances
,
she
would
never
have
*NL*
laid
so
many
snares
,
and
taken
so
many
weary
steps
to
catch
a
poor
*NL*
desolate
creature
that
was
good
for
little
when
it
was
caught
;
and
*NL*
indeed
I
,
whose
case
was
almost
desperate
,
and
thought
I
could
not
be
*NL*
much
worse
,
was
not
very
anxious
about
what
might
befall
me
,
provided
*NL*
they
did
me
no
personal
injury
;
so
I
suffered
myself
,
though
not
*NL*
without
a
great
deal
of
invitation
and
great
professions
of
sincere
*NL*
friendship
and
real
kindness
--
I
say
,
I
suffered
myself
to
be
prevailed
*NL*
upon
to
go
with
her
,
and
accordingly
I
packed
up
my
baggage
,
and
put
*NL*
myself
in
a
posture
for
a
journey
,
though
I
did
not
absolutely
know
*NL*
whither
I
was
to
go
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
I
found
myself
in
great
distress
;
what
little
I
had
in
the
*NL*
world
was
all
in
money
,
except
as
before
,
a
little
plate
,
some
linen
,
*NL*
and
my
clothes
;
as
for
my
household
stuff
,
I
had
little
or
none
,
for
I
*NL*
had
lived
always
in
lodgings
;
but
I
had
not
one
friend
in
the
world
*NL*
with
whom
to
trust
that
little
I
had
,
or
to
direct
me
how
to
dispose
of
*NL*
it
,
and
this
perplexed
me
night
and
day
.
I
thought
of
the
bank
,
and
of
*NL*
the
other
companies
in
London
,
but
I
had
no
friend
to
commit
the
*NL*
management
of
it
to
,
and
keep
and
carry
about
with
me
bank
bills
,
*NL*
tallies
,
orders
,
and
such
things
,
I
looked
upon
at
as
unsafe
;
that
if
*NL*
they
were
lost
,
my
money
was
lost
,
and
then
I
was
undone
;
and
,
on
the
*NL*
other
hand
,
I
might
be
robbed
and
perhaps
murdered
in
a
strange
place
*NL*
for
them
.
This
perplexed
me
strangely
,
and
what
to
do
I
knew
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
came
in
my
thoughts
one
morning
that
I
would
go
to
the
bank
myself
,
*NL*
where
I
had
often
been
to
receive
the
interest
of
some
bills
I
had
,
*NL*
which
had
interest
payable
on
them
,
and
where
I
had
found
a
clerk
,
to
*NL*
whom
I
applied
myself
,
very
honest
and
just
to
me
,
and
particularly
so
*NL*
fair
one
time
that
when
I
had
mistold
my
money
,
and
taken
less
than
my
*NL*
due
,
and
was
coming
away
,
he
set
me
to
rights
and
gave
me
the
rest
,
*NL*
which
he
might
have
put
into
his
own
pocket
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
went
to
him
and
represented
my
case
very
plainly
,
and
asked
if
he
*NL*
would
trouble
himself
to
be
my
adviser
,
who
was
a
poor
friendless
*NL*
widow
,
and
knew
not
what
to
do
.
He
told
me
,
if
I
desired
his
opinion
*NL*
of
anything
within
the
reach
of
his
business
,
he
would
do
his
endeavour
*NL*
that
I
should
not
be
wronged
,
but
that
he
would
also
help
me
to
a
good
*NL*
sober
person
who
was
a
grave
man
of
his
acquaintance
,
who
was
a
clerk
*NL*
in
such
business
too
,
though
not
in
their
house
,
whose
judgment
was
*NL*
good
,
and
whose
honesty
I
might
depend
upon
.
`
For
,
'
added
he
,
'
I
will
*NL*
answer
for
him
,
and
for
every
step
he
takes
;
if
he
wrongs
you
,
madam
,
*NL*
of
one
farthing
,
it
shall
lie
at
my
door
,
I
will
make
it
good
;
and
he
*NL*
delights
to
assist
people
in
such
cases
--
he
does
it
as
an
act
of
*NL*
charity
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
a
little
at
a
stand
in
this
discourse
;
but
after
some
pause
I
*NL*
told
him
I
had
rather
have
depended
upon
him
,
because
I
had
found
him
*NL*
honest
,
but
if
that
could
not
be
,
I
would
take
his
recommendation
*NL*
sooner
than
any
one
's
else
.
'
I
dare
say
,
madam
,
'
says
he
,
`
that
you
*NL*
will
be
as
well
satisfied
with
my
friend
as
with
me
,
and
he
is
*NL*
thoroughly
able
to
assist
you
,
which
I
am
not
.
'
It
seems
he
had
his
*NL*
hands
full
of
the
business
of
the
bank
,
and
had
engaged
to
meddle
with
*NL*
no
other
business
that
that
of
his
office
,
which
I
heard
afterwards
,
*NL*
but
did
not
understand
then
.
He
added
,
that
his
friend
should
take
*NL*
nothing
of
me
for
his
advice
or
assistance
,
and
this
indeed
encouraged
*NL*
me
very
much
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
appointed
the
same
evening
,
after
the
bank
was
shut
and
business
*NL*
over
,
for
me
to
meet
him
and
his
friend
.
And
indeed
as
soon
as
I
saw
*NL*
his
friend
,
and
he
began
but
to
talk
of
the
affair
,
I
was
fully
*NL*
satisfied
that
I
had
a
very
honest
man
to
deal
with
;
his
countenance
*NL*
spoke
it
,
and
his
character
,
as
I
heard
afterwards
,
was
everywhere
so
*NL*
good
,
that
I
had
no
room
for
any
more
doubts
upon
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
first
meeting
,
in
which
I
only
said
what
I
had
said
before
,
*NL*
we
parted
,
and
he
appointed
me
to
come
the
next
day
to
him
,
telling
me
*NL*
I
might
in
the
meantime
satisfy
myself
of
him
by
inquiry
,
which
,
*NL*
however
,
I
knew
not
how
well
to
do
,
having
no
acquaintance
myself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Accordingly
I
met
him
the
next
day
,
when
I
entered
more
freely
with
him
*NL*
into
my
case
.
I
told
him
my
circumstances
at
large
:
that
I
was
a
*NL*
widow
come
over
from
America
,
perfectly
desolate
and
friendless
;
that
*NL*
I
had
a
little
money
,
and
but
a
little
,
and
was
almost
distracted
for
*NL*
fear
of
losing
it
,
having
no
friend
in
the
world
to
trust
with
the
*NL*
management
of
it
;
that
I
was
going
into
the
north
of
England
to
live
*NL*
cheap
,
that
my
stock
might
not
waste
;
that
I
would
willingly
lodge
my
*NL*
money
in
the
bank
,
but
that
I
durst
not
carry
the
bills
about
me
,
and
*NL*
the
like
,
as
above
;
and
how
to
correspond
about
it
,
or
with
whom
,
I
*NL*
knew
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
told
me
I
might
lodge
the
money
in
the
bank
as
an
account
,
and
its
*NL*
being
entered
into
the
books
would
entitle
me
to
the
money
at
any
time
,
*NL*
and
if
I
was
in
the
north
I
might
draw
bills
on
the
cashier
and
receive
*NL*
it
when
I
would
;
but
that
then
it
would
be
esteemed
as
running
cash
,
*NL*
and
the
bank
would
give
no
interest
for
it
;
that
I
might
buy
stock
with
*NL*
it
,
and
so
it
would
lie
in
store
for
me
,
but
that
then
if
I
wanted
to
*NL*
dispose
if
it
,
I
must
come
up
to
town
on
purpose
to
transfer
it
,
and
*NL*
even
it
would
be
with
some
difficulty
I
should
receive
the
half-yearly
*NL*
dividend
,
unless
I
was
here
in
person
,
or
had
some
friend
I
could
trust
*NL*
with
having
the
stock
in
his
name
to
do
it
for
me
,
and
that
would
have
*NL*
the
same
difficulty
in
it
as
before
;
and
with
that
he
looked
hard
at
me
*NL*
and
smiled
a
little
.
At
last
,
says
he
,
`
Why
do
you
not
get
a
head
*NL*
steward
,
madam
,
that
may
take
you
and
your
money
together
into
keeping
,
*NL*
and
then
you
would
have
the
trouble
taken
off
your
hands
?
'
`
Ay
,
sir
,
*NL*
and
the
money
too
,
it
may
be
,
'
said
I
;
`
for
truly
I
find
the
hazard
*NL*
that
way
is
as
much
as
't
is
t
`
other
way
'
;
but
I
remember
I
said
*NL*
secretly
to
myself
,
'
I
wish
you
would
ask
me
the
question
fairly
,
I
*NL*
would
consider
very
seriously
on
it
before
I
said
No
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
on
a
good
way
with
me
,
and
I
thought
once
or
twice
he
was
in
*NL*
earnest
,
but
to
my
real
affliction
,
I
found
at
last
he
had
a
wife
;
but
*NL*
when
he
owned
he
had
a
wife
he
shook
his
head
,
and
said
with
some
*NL*
concern
,
that
indeed
he
had
a
wife
,
and
no
wife
.
I
began
to
think
he
*NL*
had
been
in
the
condition
of
my
late
lover
,
and
that
his
wife
had
been
*NL*
distempered
or
lunatic
,
or
some
such
thing
.
However
,
we
had
not
much
*NL*
more
discourse
at
that
time
,
but
he
told
me
he
was
in
too
much
hurry
of
*NL*
business
then
,
but
that
if
I
would
come
home
to
his
house
after
their
*NL*
business
was
over
,
he
would
by
that
time
consider
what
might
be
done
*NL*
for
me
,
to
put
my
affairs
in
a
posture
of
security
.
I
told
him
I
would
*NL*
come
,
and
desired
to
know
where
he
lived
.
He
gave
me
a
direction
in
*NL*
writing
,
and
when
he
gave
it
me
he
read
it
to
me
,
and
said
,
`
There
*NL*
't
is
,
madam
,
if
you
dare
trust
yourself
with
me
.
'
`
Yes
,
sir
,
'
said
I
,
*NL*
'
I
believe
I
may
venture
to
trust
you
with
myself
,
for
you
have
a
wife
,
*NL*
you
say
,
and
I
do
n't
want
a
husband
;
besides
,
I
dare
trust
you
with
my
*NL*
money
,
which
is
all
I
have
in
the
world
,
and
if
that
were
gone
,
I
may
*NL*
trust
myself
anywhere
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
said
some
things
in
jest
that
were
very
handsome
and
mannerly
,
and
*NL*
would
have
pleased
me
very
well
if
they
had
been
in
earnest
;
but
that
*NL*
passed
over
,
I
took
the
directions
,
and
appointed
to
attend
him
at
his
*NL*
house
at
seven
o'clock
the
same
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
came
he
made
several
proposals
for
my
placing
my
money
in
the
*NL*
bank
,
in
order
to
my
having
interest
for
it
;
but
still
some
difficulty
*NL*
or
other
came
in
the
way
,
which
he
objected
as
not
safe
;
and
I
found
*NL*
such
a
sincere
disinterested
honesty
in
him
,
that
I
began
to
muse
with
*NL*
myself
,
that
I
had
certainly
found
the
honest
man
I
wanted
,
and
that
I
*NL*
could
never
put
myself
into
better
hands
;
so
I
told
him
with
a
great
*NL*
deal
of
frankness
that
I
had
never
met
with
a
man
or
woman
yet
that
I
*NL*
could
trust
,
or
in
whom
I
could
think
myself
safe
,
but
that
I
saw
he
*NL*
was
so
disinterestedly
concerned
for
my
safety
,
that
I
said
I
would
*NL*
freely
trust
him
with
the
management
of
that
little
I
had
,
if
he
would
*NL*
accept
to
be
steward
for
a
poor
widow
that
could
give
him
no
salary
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
smiled
and
,
standing
up
,
with
great
respect
saluted
me
.
He
told
me
*NL*
he
could
not
but
take
it
very
kindly
that
I
had
so
good
an
opinion
of
*NL*
him
;
that
he
would
not
deceive
me
,
that
he
would
do
anything
in
his
*NL*
power
to
serve
me
,
and
expect
no
salary
;
but
that
he
could
not
by
any
*NL*
means
accept
of
a
trust
,
that
it
might
bring
him
to
be
suspected
of
*NL*
self-interest
,
and
that
if
I
should
die
he
might
have
disputes
with
my
*NL*
executors
,
which
he
should
be
very
loth
to
encumber
himself
with
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
told
him
if
those
were
all
his
objections
I
would
soon
remove
them
,
*NL*
and
convince
him
that
there
was
not
the
least
room
for
any
difficulty
;
*NL*
for
that
,
first
,
as
for
suspecting
him
,
if
ever
I
should
do
it
,
now
is
*NL*
the
time
to
suspect
him
,
and
not
put
the
trust
into
his
hands
,
and
*NL*
whenever
I
did
suspect
him
,
he
could
but
throw
it
up
then
and
refuse
to
*NL*
go
any
further
.
Then
,
as
to
executors
,
I
assured
him
I
had
no
heirs
,
*NL*
nor
any
relations
in
England
,
and
I
should
alter
my
condition
before
I
*NL*
died
,
and
then
his
trust
and
trouble
should
cease
together
,
which
,
*NL*
however
,
I
had
no
prospect
of
yet
;
but
I
told
him
if
I
died
as
I
was
,
*NL*
it
should
be
all
his
own
,
and
he
would
deserve
it
by
being
so
faithful
*NL*
to
me
as
I
was
satisfied
he
would
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
changed
his
countenance
at
this
discourse
,
and
asked
me
how
I
came
*NL*
to
have
so
much
good-will
for
him
;
and
,
looking
very
much
pleased
,
said
*NL*
he
might
very
lawfully
wish
he
was
a
single
man
for
my
sake
.
I
smiled
,
*NL*
and
told
him
as
he
was
not
,
my
offer
could
have
no
design
upon
him
in
*NL*
it
,
and
to
wish
,
as
he
did
,
was
not
to
be
allowed
,
't
was
criminal
to
*NL*
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
told
me
I
was
wrong
.
`
For
,
'
says
he
,
`
madam
,
as
I
said
before
,
I
*NL*
have
a
wife
and
no
wife
,
and
`
twould
be
no
sin
to
me
to
wish
her
*NL*
hanged
,
if
that
were
all
.
'
'
I
know
nothing
of
your
circumstances
that
*NL*
way
,
sir
,
'
said
I
;
`
but
it
can
not
be
innocent
to
wish
your
wife
dead
.
'
*NL*
'
I
tell
you
,
'
says
he
again
,
`
she
is
a
wife
and
no
wife
;
you
do
n't
know
*NL*
what
I
am
,
or
what
she
is
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
's
true
,
'
said
I
;
`
sir
,
I
do
not
know
what
you
are
,
but
I
believe
*NL*
you
to
be
an
honest
man
,
and
that
's
the
cause
of
all
my
confidence
in
*NL*
you
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
well
,
'
says
he
,
`
and
so
I
am
,
I
hope
,
too
.
But
I
am
something
*NL*
else
too
,
madam
;
for
,
'
says
he
,
`
to
be
plain
with
you
,
I
am
a
cuckold
,
*NL*
and
she
is
a
whore
.
'
He
spoke
it
in
a
kind
of
jest
,
but
it
was
with
*NL*
such
an
awkward
smile
,
that
I
perceived
it
was
what
struck
very
close
*NL*
to
him
,
and
he
looked
dismally
when
he
said
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
alters
the
case
indeed
,
sir
,
'
said
I
,
`
as
to
that
part
you
were
*NL*
speaking
of
;
but
a
cuckold
,
you
know
,
may
be
an
honest
man
;
it
does
not
*NL*
alter
that
case
at
all
.
Besides
,
I
think
,
'
said
I
,
`
since
your
wife
is
*NL*
so
dishonest
to
you
,
you
are
too
honest
to
her
to
own
her
for
your
*NL*
wife
;
but
that
,
'
said
I
,
`
is
what
I
have
nothing
to
do
with
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Nay
,
'
says
he
,
'
I
do
not
think
to
clear
my
hands
of
her
;
for
,
to
be
*NL*
plain
with
you
,
madam
,
'
added
he
,
'
I
am
no
contended
cuckold
neither
:
*NL*
on
the
other
hand
,
I
assure
you
it
provokes
me
the
highest
degree
,
but
*NL*
I
ca
n't
help
myself
;
she
that
will
be
a
whore
,
will
be
a
whore
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
waived
the
discourse
and
began
to
talk
of
my
business
;
but
I
found
he
*NL*
could
not
have
done
with
it
,
so
I
let
him
alone
,
and
he
went
on
to
tell
*NL*
me
all
the
circumstances
of
his
case
,
too
long
to
relate
here
;
*NL*
particularly
,
that
having
been
out
of
England
some
time
before
he
came
*NL*
to
the
post
he
was
in
,
she
had
had
two
children
in
the
meantime
by
an
*NL*
officer
of
the
army
;
and
that
when
he
came
to
England
and
,
upon
her
*NL*
submission
,
took
her
again
,
and
maintained
her
very
well
,
yet
she
ran
*NL*
away
from
him
with
a
linen-draper
's
apprentice
,
robbed
him
of
what
she
*NL*
could
come
at
,
and
continued
to
live
from
him
still
.
`
So
that
,
madam
,
'
*NL*
says
he
,
`
she
is
a
whore
not
by
necessity
,
which
is
the
common
bait
of
*NL*
your
sex
,
but
by
inclination
,
and
for
the
sake
of
the
vice
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
I
pitied
him
,
and
wished
him
well
rid
of
her
,
and
still
would
*NL*
have
talked
of
my
business
,
but
it
would
not
do
.
At
last
he
looks
*NL*
steadily
at
me
.
`
Look
you
,
madam
,
'
says
he
,
`
you
came
to
ask
advice
of
*NL*
me
,
and
I
will
serve
you
as
faithfully
as
if
you
were
my
own
sister
;
*NL*
but
I
must
turn
the
tables
,
since
you
oblige
me
to
do
it
,
and
are
so
*NL*
friendly
to
me
,
and
I
think
I
must
ask
advice
of
you
.
Tell
me
,
what
*NL*
must
a
poor
abused
fellow
do
with
a
whore
?
What
can
I
do
to
do
myself
*NL*
justice
upon
her
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Alas
!
sir
,
'
says
I
,
''
tis
a
case
too
nice
for
me
to
advise
in
,
but
it
*NL*
seems
she
has
run
away
from
you
,
so
you
are
rid
of
her
fairly
;
what
can
*NL*
you
desire
more
?
'
`
Ay
,
she
is
gone
indeed
,
'
said
he
,
`
but
I
am
not
*NL*
clear
of
her
for
all
that
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
's
true
,
'
says
I
;
`
she
may
indeed
run
you
into
debt
,
but
the
law
*NL*
has
furnished
you
with
methods
to
prevent
that
also
;
you
may
cry
her
*NL*
down
,
as
they
call
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
no
,
'
says
he
,
`
that
is
not
the
case
neither
;
I
have
taken
care
of
*NL*
all
that
;
't
is
not
that
part
that
I
speak
of
,
but
I
would
be
rid
of
her
*NL*
so
that
I
might
marry
again
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
sir
,
'
says
I
,
`
then
you
must
divorce
her
.
If
you
can
prove
what
*NL*
you
say
,
you
may
certainly
get
that
done
,
and
then
,
I
suppose
,
you
are
*NL*
free
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
's
very
tedious
and
expensive
,
'
says
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
'
says
I
,
`
if
you
can
get
any
woman
you
like
to
take
your
word
,
I
*NL*
suppose
your
wife
would
not
dispute
the
liberty
with
you
that
she
takes
*NL*
herself
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ay
,
'
says
he
,
`
but
`
twould
be
hard
to
bring
an
honest
woman
to
do
*NL*
that
;
and
for
the
other
sort
,
'
says
he
,
'
I
have
had
enough
of
her
to
*NL*
meddle
with
any
more
whores
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
It
occurred
to
me
presently
,
'
I
would
have
taken
your
word
with
all
my
*NL*
heart
,
if
you
had
but
asked
me
the
question
'
;
but
that
was
to
myself
.
*NL*
To
him
I
replied
,
`
Why
,
you
shut
the
door
against
any
honest
woman
*NL*
accepting
you
,
for
you
condemn
all
that
should
venture
upon
you
at
*NL*
once
,
and
conclude
,
that
really
a
woman
that
takes
you
now
ca
n't
be
*NL*
honest
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
'
says
he
,
'
I
wish
you
would
satisfy
me
that
an
honest
woman
would
*NL*
take
me
;
I
'd
venture
it
'
;
and
then
turns
short
upon
me
,
`
Will
you
take
*NL*
me
,
madam
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
's
not
a
fair
question
,
'
says
I
,
`
after
what
you
have
said
;
*NL*
however
,
lest
you
should
think
I
wait
only
for
a
recantation
of
it
,
I
*NL*
shall
answer
you
plainly
,
No
,
not
I
;
my
business
is
of
another
kind
*NL*
with
you
,
and
I
did
not
expect
you
would
have
turned
my
serious
*NL*
application
to
you
,
in
my
own
distracted
case
,
into
a
comedy
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
madam
,
'
says
he
,
`
my
case
is
as
distracted
as
yours
can
be
,
and
I
*NL*
stand
in
as
much
need
of
advice
as
you
do
,
for
I
think
if
I
have
not
*NL*
relief
somewhere
,
I
shall
be
made
myself
,
and
I
know
not
what
course
to
*NL*
take
,
I
protest
to
you
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
sir
,
'
says
I
,
''
tis
easy
to
give
advice
in
your
case
,
much
easier
*NL*
than
it
is
in
mine
.
'
`
Speak
then
,
'
says
he
,
'
I
beg
of
you
,
for
now
you
*NL*
encourage
me
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
'
says
I
,
`
if
your
case
is
so
plain
as
you
say
it
is
,
you
may
be
*NL*
legally
divorced
,
and
then
you
may
find
honest
women
enough
to
ask
the
*NL*
question
of
fairly
;
the
sex
is
not
so
scarce
that
you
can
want
a
wife
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
then
,
'
said
he
,
'
I
am
in
earnest
;
I
'll
take
your
advice
;
but
*NL*
shall
I
ask
you
one
question
seriously
beforehand
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Any
question
,
'
said
I
,
`
but
that
you
did
before
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
that
answer
will
not
do
,
'
said
he
,
`
for
,
in
short
,
that
is
the
*NL*
question
I
shall
ask
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
may
ask
what
questions
you
please
,
but
you
have
my
answer
to
that
*NL*
already
,
'
said
I.
`
Besides
,
sir
,
'
said
I
,
`
can
you
think
so
ill
of
me
*NL*
as
that
I
would
give
any
answer
to
such
a
question
beforehand
?
Can
any
*NL*
woman
alive
believe
you
in
earnest
,
or
think
you
design
anything
but
to
*NL*
banter
her
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
well
,
'
says
he
,
'
I
do
not
banter
you
,
I
am
in
earnest
;
consider
*NL*
of
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
,
sir
,
'
says
I
,
a
little
gravely
,
'
I
came
to
you
about
my
own
*NL*
business
;
I
beg
of
you
to
let
me
know
,
what
you
will
advise
me
to
do
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
will
be
prepared
,
'
says
he
,
`
against
you
come
again
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Nay
,
'
says
I
,
`
you
have
forbid
my
coming
any
more
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
so
?
'
said
he
,
and
looked
a
little
surprised
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Because
,
'
said
I
,
`
you
ca
n't
expect
I
should
visit
you
on
the
account
*NL*
you
talk
of
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
'
says
he
,
`
you
shall
promise
me
to
come
again
,
however
,
and
I
*NL*
will
not
say
any
more
of
it
till
I
have
gotten
the
divorce
,
but
I
*NL*
desire
you
will
prepare
to
be
better
conditioned
when
that
's
done
,
for
*NL*
you
shall
be
the
woman
,
or
I
will
not
be
divorced
at
all
;
why
,
I
owe
it
*NL*
to
your
unlooked-for
kindness
,
if
it
were
to
nothing
else
,
but
I
have
*NL*
other
reasons
too
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
not
have
said
anything
in
the
world
that
pleased
me
better
;
*NL*
however
,
I
knew
that
the
way
to
secure
him
was
to
stand
off
while
the
*NL*
thing
was
so
remote
,
as
it
appeared
to
be
,
and
that
it
was
time
enough
*NL*
to
accept
of
it
when
he
was
able
to
perform
it
;
so
I
said
very
*NL*
respectfully
to
him
,
it
was
time
enough
to
consider
of
these
things
*NL*
when
he
was
in
a
condition
to
talk
of
them
;
in
the
meantime
,
I
told
*NL*
him
,
I
was
going
a
great
way
from
him
,
and
he
would
find
objects
enough
*NL*
to
please
him
better
.
We
broke
off
here
for
the
present
,
and
he
made
*NL*
me
promise
him
to
come
again
the
next
day
,
for
his
resolutions
upon
my
*NL*
own
business
,
which
after
some
pressing
I
did
;
though
had
he
seen
*NL*
farther
into
me
,
I
wanted
no
pressing
on
that
account
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
came
the
next
evening
,
accordingly
,
and
brought
my
maid
with
me
,
to
*NL*
let
him
see
that
I
kept
a
maid
,
but
I
sent
her
away
as
soon
as
I
was
*NL*
gone
in
.
He
would
have
had
me
let
the
maid
have
stayed
,
but
I
would
*NL*
not
,
but
ordered
her
aloud
to
come
for
me
again
about
nine
o'clock
.
*NL*
But
he
forbade
that
,
and
told
me
he
would
see
me
safe
home
,
which
,
by
*NL*
the
way
,
I
was
not
very
well
please
with
,
supposing
he
might
do
that
to
*NL*
know
where
I
lived
and
inquire
into
my
character
and
circumstances
.
*NL*
However
,
I
ventured
that
,
for
all
that
the
people
there
or
thereabout
*NL*
knew
of
me
,
was
to
my
advantage
;
and
all
the
character
he
had
of
me
,
*NL*
after
he
had
inquired
,
was
that
I
was
a
woman
of
fortune
,
and
that
I
*NL*
was
a
very
modest
,
sober
body
;
which
,
whether
true
or
not
in
the
main
,
*NL*
yet
you
may
see
how
necessary
it
is
for
all
women
who
expect
anything
*NL*
in
the
world
,
to
preserve
the
character
of
their
virtue
,
even
when
*NL*
perhaps
they
may
have
sacrificed
the
thing
itself
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
found
,
and
was
not
a
little
please
with
it
,
that
he
had
provided
a
*NL*
supper
for
me
.
I
found
also
he
lived
very
handsomely
,
and
had
a
house
*NL*
very
handsomely
furnished
;
all
of
which
I
was
rejoiced
at
indeed
,
for
I
*NL*
looked
upon
it
as
all
my
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
now
a
second
conference
upon
the
subject-matter
of
the
last
*NL*
conference
.
He
laid
his
business
very
home
indeed
;
he
protested
his
*NL*
affection
to
me
,
and
indeed
I
had
no
room
to
doubt
it
;
he
declared
that
*NL*
it
began
from
the
first
moment
I
talked
with
him
,
and
long
before
I
had
*NL*
mentioned
leaving
my
effects
with
him
.
''
Tis
no
matter
when
it
began
,
'
*NL*
thought
I
;
`
if
it
will
but
hold
,
`
twill
be
well
enough
.
'
He
then
told
*NL*
me
how
much
the
offer
I
had
made
of
trusting
him
with
my
effects
,
and
*NL*
leaving
them
to
him
,
had
engaged
him
.
`
So
I
intended
it
should
,
'
*NL*
thought
I
,
`
but
then
I
thought
you
had
been
a
single
man
too
.
'
After
*NL*
we
had
supped
,
I
observed
he
pressed
me
very
hard
to
drink
two
or
three
*NL*
glasses
of
wine
,
which
,
however
,
I
declined
,
but
drank
one
glass
or
*NL*
two
.
He
then
told
me
he
had
a
proposal
to
make
to
me
,
which
I
should
*NL*
promise
him
I
would
not
take
ill
if
I
should
not
grant
it
.
I
told
him
*NL*
I
hoped
he
would
make
no
dishonourable
proposal
to
me
,
especially
in
*NL*
his
own
house
,
and
that
if
it
was
such
,
I
desired
he
would
not
propose
*NL*
it
,
that
I
might
not
be
obliged
to
offer
any
resentment
to
him
that
did
*NL*
not
become
the
respect
I
professed
for
him
,
and
the
trust
I
had
placed
*NL*
in
him
in
coming
to
his
house
;
and
begged
of
him
he
would
give
me
leave
*NL*
to
go
away
,
and
accordingly
began
to
put
on
my
gloves
and
prepare
to
be
*NL*
gone
,
though
at
the
same
time
I
no
more
intended
it
than
he
intended
to
*NL*
let
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
he
importuned
me
not
to
talk
of
going
;
he
assured
me
he
had
no
*NL*
dishonourable
thing
in
his
thoughts
about
me
,
and
was
very
far
from
*NL*
offering
anything
to
me
that
was
dishonourable
,
and
if
I
thought
so
,
he
*NL*
would
choose
to
say
no
more
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
part
I
did
not
relish
at
all
.
I
told
him
I
was
ready
to
hear
*NL*
anything
that
he
had
to
say
,
depending
that
he
would
say
nothing
*NL*
unworthy
of
himself
,
or
unfit
for
me
to
hear
.
Upon
this
,
he
told
me
*NL*
his
proposal
was
this
:
that
I
would
marry
him
,
though
he
had
not
yet
*NL*
obtained
the
divorce
from
the
whore
his
wife
;
and
to
satisfy
me
that
he
*NL*
meant
honourably
,
he
would
promise
not
to
desire
me
to
live
with
him
,
*NL*
or
go
to
bed
with
him
till
the
divorce
was
obtained
.
My
heart
said
yes
*NL*
to
this
offer
at
first
word
,
but
it
was
necessary
to
play
the
hypocrite
*NL*
a
little
more
with
him
;
so
I
seemed
to
decline
the
motion
with
some
*NL*
warmth
,
and
besides
a
little
condemning
the
thing
as
unfair
,
told
him
*NL*
that
such
a
proposal
could
be
of
no
signification
,
but
to
entangle
us
*NL*
both
in
great
difficulties
;
for
if
he
should
not
at
last
obtain
the
*NL*
divorce
,
yet
we
could
not
dissolve
the
marriage
,
neither
could
we
*NL*
proceed
in
it
;
so
that
if
he
was
disappointed
in
the
divorce
,
I
left
*NL*
him
to
consider
what
a
condition
we
should
both
be
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
short
,
I
carried
on
the
argument
against
this
so
far
,
that
I
*NL*
convinced
him
it
was
not
a
proposal
that
had
any
sense
in
it
.
Well
,
*NL*
then
he
went
from
it
to
another
,
and
that
was
,
that
I
would
sign
and
*NL*
seal
a
contract
with
him
,
conditioning
to
marry
him
as
soon
as
the
*NL*
divorce
was
obtained
,
and
to
be
void
if
he
could
not
obtain
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
told
him
such
a
thing
was
more
rational
than
the
other
;
but
as
this
*NL*
was
the
first
time
that
ever
I
could
imagine
him
weak
enough
to
be
in
*NL*
earnest
in
this
affair
,
I
did
not
use
to
say
Yes
at
first
asking
;
I
*NL*
would
consider
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
played
with
this
lover
as
an
angler
does
with
a
trout
.
I
found
I
had
*NL*
him
fast
on
the
hook
,
so
I
jested
with
his
new
proposal
,
and
put
him
*NL*
off
.
I
told
him
he
knew
little
of
me
,
and
bade
him
inquire
about
me
;
I
*NL*
let
him
also
go
home
with
me
to
my
lodging
,
though
I
would
not
ask
him
*NL*
to
go
in
,
for
I
told
him
it
was
not
decent
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
short
,
I
ventured
to
avoid
signing
a
contract
of
marriage
,
and
the
*NL*
reason
why
I
did
it
was
because
the
lady
that
had
invited
me
so
*NL*
earnestly
to
go
with
her
into
Lancashire
insisted
so
positively
upon
*NL*
it
,
and
promised
me
such
great
fortunes
,
and
such
fine
things
there
,
*NL*
that
I
was
tempted
to
go
and
try
.
`
Perhaps
,
'
said
I
,
'
I
may
mend
*NL*
myself
very
much
'
;
and
then
I
made
no
scruple
in
my
thoughts
of
*NL*
quitting
my
honest
citizen
,
whom
I
was
not
so
much
in
love
with
as
not
*NL*
to
leave
him
for
a
richer
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
word
,
I
avoided
a
contract
;
but
told
him
I
would
go
into
the
*NL*
north
,
that
he
should
know
where
to
write
to
me
by
the
consequence
of
*NL*
the
business
I
had
entrusted
with
him
;
that
I
would
give
him
a
*NL*
sufficient
pledge
of
my
respect
for
him
,
for
I
would
leave
almost
all
I
*NL*
had
in
the
world
in
his
hands
;
and
I
would
thus
far
give
him
my
word
,
*NL*
that
as
soon
as
he
had
sued
out
a
divorce
from
his
first
wife
,
he
would
*NL*
send
me
an
account
of
it
,
I
would
come
up
to
London
,
and
that
then
we
*NL*
would
talk
seriously
of
the
matter
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
base
design
I
went
with
,
that
I
must
confess
,
though
I
was
*NL*
invited
thither
with
a
design
much
worse
than
mine
was
,
as
the
sequel
*NL*
will
discover
.
Well
,
I
went
with
my
friend
,
as
I
called
her
,
into
*NL*
Lancashire
.
All
the
way
we
went
she
caressed
me
with
the
utmost
*NL*
appearance
of
a
sincere
,
undissembled
affection
;
treated
me
,
except
my
*NL*
coach-hire
,
all
the
way
;
and
her
brother
brought
a
gentleman
's
coach
to
*NL*
Warrington
to
receive
us
,
and
we
were
carried
from
thence
to
Liverpool
*NL*
with
as
much
ceremony
as
I
could
desire
.
We
were
also
entertained
at
a
*NL*
merchant
's
house
in
Liverpool
three
or
four
days
very
handsomely
;
I
*NL*
forbear
to
tell
his
name
,
because
of
what
followed
.
Then
she
told
me
*NL*
she
would
carry
me
to
an
uncle
's
house
of
hers
,
where
we
should
be
*NL*
nobly
entertained
.
She
did
so
;
her
uncle
,
as
she
called
him
,
sent
a
*NL*
coach
and
four
horses
for
us
,
and
we
were
carried
near
forty
miles
I
*NL*
know
not
whither
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
came
,
however
,
to
a
gentleman
's
seat
,
where
was
a
numerous
family
,
a
*NL*
large
park
,
extraordinary
company
indeed
,
and
where
she
was
called
*NL*
cousin
.
I
told
her
if
she
had
resolved
to
bring
me
into
such
company
*NL*
as
this
,
she
should
have
let
me
have
prepared
myself
,
and
have
*NL*
furnished
myself
with
better
clothes
.
The
ladies
took
notice
of
that
,
*NL*
and
told
me
very
genteelly
they
did
not
value
people
in
their
country
*NL*
so
much
by
their
clothes
as
they
did
in
London
;
that
their
cousin
had
*NL*
fully
informed
them
of
my
quality
,
and
that
I
did
not
want
clothes
to
*NL*
set
me
off
;
in
short
,
they
entertained
me
,
not
like
what
I
was
,
but
*NL*
like
what
they
thought
I
had
been
,
namely
,
a
widow
lady
of
a
great
*NL*
fortune
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
discovery
I
made
here
was
,
that
the
family
were
all
Roman
*NL*
Catholics
,
and
the
cousin
too
,
whom
I
called
my
friend
;
however
,
I
must
*NL*
say
that
nobody
in
the
world
could
behave
better
to
me
,
and
I
had
all
*NL*
the
civility
shown
me
that
I
could
have
had
if
I
had
been
of
their
*NL*
opinion
.
The
truth
is
,
I
had
not
so
much
principle
of
any
kind
as
to
*NL*
be
nice
in
point
of
religion
,
and
I
presently
learned
to
speak
*NL*
favourably
of
the
Romish
Church
;
particularly
,
I
told
them
I
saw
little
*NL*
but
the
prejudice
of
education
in
all
the
difference
that
were
among
*NL*
Christians
about
religion
,
and
if
it
had
so
happened
that
my
father
had
*NL*
been
a
Roman
Catholic
,
I
doubted
not
but
I
should
have
been
as
well
*NL*
pleased
with
their
religion
as
my
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
obliged
them
in
the
highest
degree
,
and
as
I
was
besieged
day
and
*NL*
night
with
good
company
and
pleasant
discourse
,
so
I
had
two
or
three
*NL*
old
ladies
that
lay
at
me
upon
the
subject
of
religion
too
.
I
was
so
*NL*
complaisant
,
that
though
I
would
not
completely
engage
,
yet
I
made
no
*NL*
scruple
to
be
present
at
their
mass
,
and
to
conform
to
all
their
*NL*
gestures
as
they
showed
me
the
pattern
,
but
I
would
not
come
too
cheap
;
*NL*
so
that
I
only
in
the
main
encouraged
them
to
expect
that
I
would
turn
*NL*
Roman
Catholic
,
if
I
was
instructed
in
the
Catholic
doctrine
as
they
*NL*
called
it
,
and
so
the
matter
rested
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
stayed
here
about
six
weeks
;
and
then
my
conductor
led
me
back
to
a
*NL*
country
village
,
about
six
miles
from
Liverpool
,
where
her
brother
-LRB-
as
*NL*
she
called
him
-RRB-
came
to
visit
me
in
his
own
chariot
,
and
in
a
very
good
*NL*
figure
,
with
two
footmen
in
a
good
livery
;
and
the
next
thing
was
to
*NL*
make
love
to
me
.
As
it
had
happened
to
me
,
one
would
think
I
could
not
*NL*
have
been
cheated
,
and
indeed
I
thought
so
myself
,
having
a
safe
card
*NL*
at
home
,
which
I
resolved
not
to
quit
unless
I
could
mend
myself
very
*NL*
much
.
However
,
in
all
appearance
this
brother
was
a
match
worth
my
*NL*
listening
to
,
and
the
least
his
estate
was
valued
at
was
#
1000
a
year
,
*NL*
but
the
sister
said
it
was
worth
#
1500
a
year
,
and
lay
most
of
it
in
*NL*
Ireland
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
that
was
a
great
fortune
,
and
passed
for
such
,
was
above
being
asked
*NL*
how
much
my
estate
was
;
and
my
false
friend
taking
it
upon
a
foolish
*NL*
hearsay
,
had
raised
it
from
#
500
to
#
5000
,
and
by
the
time
she
came
*NL*
into
the
country
she
called
it
#
15,000
.
The
Irishman
,
for
such
I
*NL*
understood
him
to
be
,
was
stark
mad
at
this
bait
;
in
short
,
he
courted
*NL*
me
,
made
me
presents
,
and
ran
in
debt
like
a
madman
for
the
expenses
of
*NL*
his
equipage
and
of
his
courtship
.
He
had
,
to
give
him
his
due
,
the
*NL*
appearance
of
an
extraordinary
fine
gentleman
;
he
was
tall
,
*NL*
well-shaped
,
and
had
an
extraordinary
address
;
talked
as
naturally
of
*NL*
his
park
and
his
stables
,
of
his
horses
,
his
gamekeepers
,
his
woods
,
*NL*
his
tenants
,
and
his
servants
,
as
if
we
had
been
in
the
mansion-house
,
*NL*
and
I
had
seen
them
all
about
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
never
so
much
as
asked
me
about
my
fortune
or
estate
,
but
assured
me
*NL*
that
when
we
came
to
Dublin
he
would
jointure
me
in
#
600
a
year
good
*NL*
land
;
and
that
we
could
enter
into
a
deed
of
settlement
or
contract
*NL*
here
for
the
performance
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
such
language
indeed
as
I
had
not
been
used
to
,
and
I
was
here
*NL*
beaten
out
of
all
my
measures
;
I
had
a
she-devil
in
my
bosom
,
every
*NL*
hour
telling
me
how
great
her
brother
lived
.
One
time
she
would
come
*NL*
for
my
orders
,
how
I
would
have
my
coaches
painted
,
and
how
lined
;
and
*NL*
another
time
what
clothes
my
page
should
wear
;
in
short
,
my
eyes
were
*NL*
dazzled
.
I
had
now
lost
my
power
of
saying
No
,
and
,
to
cut
the
story
*NL*
short
,
I
consented
to
be
married
;
but
to
be
the
more
private
,
we
were
*NL*
carried
farther
into
the
country
,
and
married
by
a
Romish
clergyman
,
*NL*
who
I
was
assured
would
marry
us
as
effectually
as
a
Church
of
England
*NL*
parson
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
can
not
say
but
I
had
some
reflections
in
this
affair
upon
the
*NL*
dishonourable
forsaking
my
faithful
citizen
,
who
loved
me
sincerely
,
*NL*
and
who
was
endeavouring
to
quit
himself
of
a
scandalous
whore
by
whom
*NL*
he
had
been
indeed
barbarously
used
,
and
promised
himself
infinite
*NL*
happiness
in
his
new
choice
;
which
choice
was
now
giving
up
herself
to
*NL*
another
in
a
manner
almost
as
scandalous
as
hers
could
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
glittering
shoe
of
a
great
estate
,
and
of
fine
things
,
which
*NL*
the
deceived
creature
that
was
now
my
deceiver
represented
every
hour
*NL*
to
my
imagination
,
hurried
me
away
,
and
gave
me
no
time
to
think
of
*NL*
London
,
or
of
anything
there
,
much
less
of
the
obligation
I
had
to
a
*NL*
person
of
infinitely
more
real
merit
than
what
was
now
before
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
thing
was
done
;
I
was
now
in
the
arms
of
my
new
spouse
,
who
*NL*
appeared
still
the
same
as
before
;
great
even
to
magnificence
,
and
*NL*
nothing
less
than
#
1000
a
year
could
support
the
ordinary
equipage
he
*NL*
appeared
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
we
had
been
married
about
a
month
,
he
began
to
talk
of
my
going
*NL*
to
West
Chester
in
order
to
embark
for
Ireland
.
However
,
he
did
not
*NL*
hurry
me
,
for
we
stayed
near
three
weeks
longer
,
and
then
he
sent
to
*NL*
Chester
for
a
coach
to
meet
us
at
the
Black
Rock
,
as
they
call
it
,
over
*NL*
against
Liverpool
.
Thither
we
went
in
a
fine
boat
they
call
a
pinnace
,
*NL*
with
six
oars
;
his
servants
,
and
horses
,
and
baggage
going
in
the
*NL*
ferry-boat
.
He
made
his
excuse
to
me
that
he
had
no
acquaintance
in
*NL*
Chester
,
but
he
would
go
before
and
get
some
handsome
apartment
for
me
*NL*
at
a
private
house
.
I
asked
him
how
long
we
should
stay
at
Chester
.
*NL*
He
said
,
not
at
all
,
any
longer
than
one
night
or
two
,
but
he
would
*NL*
immediately
hire
a
coach
to
go
to
Holyhead
.
Then
I
told
him
he
should
*NL*
by
no
means
give
himself
the
trouble
to
get
private
lodgings
for
one
*NL*
night
or
two
,
for
that
Chester
being
a
great
place
,
I
made
no
doubt
but
*NL*
there
would
be
very
good
inns
and
accommodation
enough
;
so
we
lodged
at
*NL*
an
inn
in
the
West
Street
,
not
far
from
the
Cathedral
;
I
forget
what
*NL*
sign
it
was
at
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
my
spouse
,
talking
of
my
going
to
Ireland
,
asked
me
if
I
had
no
*NL*
affairs
to
settle
at
London
before
we
went
off
.
I
told
him
No
,
not
of
*NL*
any
great
consequence
,
but
what
might
be
done
as
well
by
letter
from
*NL*
Dublin
.
`
Madam
,
'
says
he
,
very
respectfully
,
'
I
suppose
the
greatest
*NL*
part
of
your
estate
,
which
my
sister
tells
me
is
most
of
it
in
money
in
*NL*
the
Bank
of
England
,
lies
secure
enough
,
but
in
case
it
required
*NL*
transferring
,
or
any
way
altering
its
property
,
it
might
be
necessary
*NL*
to
go
up
to
London
and
settle
those
things
before
we
went
over
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
seemed
to
look
strange
at
it
,
and
told
him
I
knew
not
what
he
meant
;
*NL*
that
I
had
no
effects
in
the
Bank
of
England
that
I
knew
of
;
and
I
*NL*
hoped
he
could
not
say
that
I
had
ever
told
him
I
had
.
No
,
he
said
,
I
*NL*
had
not
told
him
so
,
but
his
sister
had
said
the
greatest
part
of
my
*NL*
estate
lay
there
.
`
And
I
only
mentioned
it
,
me
dear
,
'
said
he
,
`
that
*NL*
if
there
was
any
occasion
to
settle
it
,
or
order
anything
about
it
,
we
*NL*
might
not
be
obliged
to
the
hazard
and
trouble
of
another
voyage
back
*NL*
again
'
;
for
he
added
,
that
he
did
not
care
to
venture
me
too
much
upon
*NL*
the
sea
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
surprised
at
this
talk
,
and
began
to
consider
very
seriously
what
*NL*
the
meaning
of
it
must
be
;
and
it
presently
occurred
to
me
that
my
*NL*
friend
,
who
called
him
brother
,
had
represented
me
in
colours
which
*NL*
were
not
my
due
;
and
I
thought
,
since
it
was
come
to
that
pitch
,
that
I
*NL*
would
know
the
bottom
of
it
before
I
went
out
of
England
,
and
before
I
*NL*
should
put
myself
into
I
knew
not
whose
hands
in
a
strange
country
.
*NL*
*NL*
Upon
this
I
called
his
sister
into
my
chamber
the
next
morning
,
and
*NL*
letting
her
know
the
discourse
her
brother
and
I
had
been
upon
the
*NL*
evening
before
,
I
conjured
her
to
tell
me
what
she
had
said
to
him
,
and
*NL*
upon
what
foot
it
was
that
she
had
made
this
marriage
.
She
owned
that
*NL*
she
had
told
him
that
I
was
a
great
fortune
,
and
said
that
she
was
told
*NL*
so
at
London
.
`
Told
so
!
'
says
I
warmly
;
`
did
I
ever
tell
you
so
?
'
No
,
*NL*
she
said
,
it
was
true
I
did
not
tell
her
so
,
but
I
had
said
several
*NL*
times
that
what
I
had
was
in
my
own
disposal
.
'
I
did
so
,
'
returned
I
*NL*
very
quickly
and
hastily
,
`
but
I
never
told
you
I
had
anything
called
a
*NL*
fortune
;
no
,
not
that
I
had
#
100
,
or
the
value
of
#
100
,
in
the
world
.
*NL*
Any
how
did
it
consist
with
my
being
a
fortune
,
'
said
I
,
`
that
I
should
*NL*
come
here
into
the
north
of
England
with
you
,
only
upon
the
account
of
*NL*
living
cheap
?
'
At
these
words
,
which
I
spoke
warm
and
high
,
my
husband
,
*NL*
her
brother
-LRB-
as
she
called
him
-RRB-
,
came
into
the
room
,
and
I
desired
him
*NL*
to
come
and
sit
down
,
for
I
had
something
of
moment
to
say
before
them
*NL*
both
,
which
it
was
absolutely
necessary
he
should
hear
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
a
little
disturbed
at
the
assurance
with
which
I
seemed
to
*NL*
speak
it
,
and
came
and
sat
down
by
me
,
having
first
shut
the
door
;
upon
*NL*
which
I
began
,
for
I
was
very
much
provoked
,
and
turning
myself
to
him
,
*NL*
'
I
am
afraid
,
'
says
I
,
`
my
dear
'
-LRB-
for
I
spoke
with
kindness
on
his
*NL*
side
-RRB-
,
`
that
you
have
a
very
great
abuse
put
upon
you
,
and
an
injury
*NL*
done
you
never
to
be
repaired
in
your
marrying
me
,
which
,
however
,
as
I
*NL*
have
had
no
hand
in
it
,
I
desire
I
may
be
fairly
acquitted
of
it
,
and
*NL*
that
the
blame
may
lie
where
it
ought
to
lie
,
and
nowhere
else
,
for
I
*NL*
wash
my
hands
of
every
part
of
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
injury
can
be
done
me
,
my
dear
,
'
says
he
,
`
in
marrying
you
.
I
*NL*
hope
it
is
to
my
honour
and
advantage
every
way
.
'
'
I
will
soon
explain
*NL*
it
to
you
,
'
says
I
,
`
and
I
fear
you
will
have
no
reason
to
think
*NL*
yourself
well
used
;
but
I
will
convince
you
,
my
dear
,
'
says
I
again
,
*NL*
`
that
I
have
had
no
hand
in
it
'
;
and
there
I
stopped
a
while
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
now
scared
and
wild
,
and
began
,
I
believe
,
to
suspect
what
*NL*
followed
;
however
,
looking
towards
me
,
and
saying
only
,
`
Go
on
,
'
he
sat
*NL*
silent
,
as
if
to
hear
what
I
had
more
to
say
;
so
I
went
on
.
'
I
asked
*NL*
you
last
night
,
'
said
I
,
speaking
to
him
,
`
if
ever
I
made
any
boast
to
*NL*
you
of
my
estate
,
or
ever
told
you
I
had
any
estate
in
the
Bank
of
*NL*
England
or
anywhere
else
,
and
you
owned
I
had
not
,
as
is
most
true
;
and
*NL*
I
desire
you
will
tell
me
here
,
before
your
sister
,
if
ever
I
gave
you
*NL*
any
reason
from
me
to
think
so
,
or
that
ever
we
had
any
discourse
about
*NL*
it
'
;
and
he
owned
again
I
had
not
,
but
said
I
had
appeared
always
as
a
*NL*
woman
of
fortune
,
and
he
depended
on
it
that
I
was
so
,
and
hoped
he
was
*NL*
not
deceived
.
'
I
am
not
inquiring
yet
whether
you
have
been
deceived
*NL*
or
not
,
'
said
I
;
'
I
fear
you
have
,
and
I
too
;
but
I
am
clearing
myself
*NL*
from
the
unjust
charge
of
being
concerned
in
deceiving
you
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
have
been
now
asking
your
sister
if
ever
I
told
her
of
any
fortune
*NL*
or
estate
I
had
,
or
gave
her
any
particulars
of
it
;
and
she
owns
I
*NL*
never
did
.
Any
pray
,
madam
,
'
said
I
,
turning
myself
to
her
,
`
be
so
*NL*
just
to
me
,
before
your
brother
,
to
charge
me
,
if
you
can
,
if
ever
I
*NL*
pretended
to
you
that
I
had
an
estate
;
and
why
,
if
I
had
,
should
I
come
*NL*
down
into
this
country
with
you
on
purpose
to
spare
that
little
I
had
,
*NL*
and
live
cheap
?
'
She
could
not
deny
one
word
,
but
said
she
had
been
*NL*
told
in
London
that
I
had
a
very
great
fortune
,
and
that
it
lay
in
the
*NL*
Bank
of
England
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
now
,
dear
sir
,
'
said
I
,
turning
myself
to
my
new
spouse
again
,
`
be
*NL*
so
just
to
me
as
to
tell
me
who
has
abused
both
you
and
me
so
much
as
*NL*
to
make
you
believe
I
was
a
fortune
,
and
prompt
you
to
court
me
to
this
*NL*
marriage
?
'
He
could
not
speak
a
word
,
but
pointed
to
her
;
and
,
after
*NL*
some
more
pause
,
flew
out
in
the
most
furious
passion
that
ever
I
saw
a
*NL*
man
in
my
life
,
cursing
her
,
and
calling
her
all
the
whores
and
hard
*NL*
names
he
could
think
of
;
and
that
she
had
ruined
him
,
declaring
that
*NL*
she
had
told
him
I
had
#
15,000
,
and
that
she
was
to
have
#
500
of
him
*NL*
for
procuring
this
match
for
him
.
He
then
added
,
directing
his
speech
*NL*
to
me
,
that
she
was
none
of
his
sister
,
but
had
been
his
whore
for
two
*NL*
years
before
,
that
she
had
had
#
100
of
him
in
part
of
this
bargain
,
and
*NL*
that
he
was
utterly
undone
if
things
were
as
I
said
;
and
in
his
raving
*NL*
he
swore
he
would
let
her
heart
's
blood
out
immediately
,
which
*NL*
frightened
her
and
me
too
.
She
cried
,
said
she
had
been
told
so
in
the
*NL*
house
where
I
lodged
.
But
this
aggravated
him
more
than
before
,
that
*NL*
she
should
put
so
far
upon
him
,
and
run
things
such
a
length
upon
no
*NL*
other
authority
than
a
hearsay
;
and
then
,
turning
to
me
again
,
said
*NL*
very
honestly
,
he
was
afraid
we
were
both
undone
.
`
For
,
to
be
plain
,
*NL*
my
dear
,
I
have
no
estate
,
'
says
he
;
`
what
little
I
had
,
this
devil
has
*NL*
made
me
run
out
in
waiting
on
you
and
putting
me
into
this
equipage
.
'
*NL*
She
took
the
opportunity
of
his
being
earnest
in
talking
with
me
,
and
*NL*
got
out
of
the
room
,
and
I
never
saw
her
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
confounded
now
as
much
as
he
,
and
knew
not
what
to
say
.
I
*NL*
thought
many
ways
that
I
had
the
worst
of
it
,
but
his
saying
he
was
*NL*
undone
,
and
that
he
had
no
estate
neither
,
put
me
into
a
mere
*NL*
distraction
.
`
Why
,
'
says
I
to
him
,
`
this
has
been
a
hellish
juggle
,
*NL*
for
we
are
married
here
upon
the
foot
of
a
double
fraud
;
you
are
undone
*NL*
by
the
disappointment
,
it
seems
;
and
if
I
had
had
a
fortune
I
had
been
*NL*
cheated
too
,
for
you
say
you
have
nothing
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
would
indeed
have
been
cheated
,
my
dear
,
'
says
he
,
`
but
you
would
*NL*
not
have
been
undone
,
for
#
15,000
would
have
maintained
us
both
very
*NL*
handsomely
in
this
country
;
and
I
assure
you
,
'
added
he
,
'
I
had
*NL*
resolved
to
have
dedicated
every
groat
of
it
to
you
;
I
would
not
have
*NL*
wronged
you
of
a
shilling
,
and
the
rest
I
would
have
made
up
in
my
*NL*
affection
to
you
,
and
tenderness
of
you
,
as
long
as
I
lived
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
very
honest
indeed
,
and
I
really
believe
he
spoke
as
he
*NL*
intended
,
and
that
he
was
a
man
that
was
as
well
qualified
to
make
me
*NL*
happy
,
as
to
his
temper
and
behaviour
,
as
any
man
ever
was
;
but
his
*NL*
having
no
estate
,
and
being
run
into
debt
on
this
ridiculous
account
in
*NL*
the
country
,
made
all
the
prospect
dismal
and
dreadful
,
and
I
knew
not
*NL*
what
to
say
,
or
what
to
think
of
myself
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
told
him
it
was
very
unhappy
that
so
much
love
,
and
so
much
good
*NL*
nature
as
I
discovered
in
him
,
should
be
thus
precipitated
into
misery
;
*NL*
that
I
saw
nothing
before
us
but
ruin
;
for
as
to
me
,
it
was
my
*NL*
unhappiness
that
what
little
I
had
was
not
able
to
relieve
us
week
,
and
*NL*
with
that
I
pulled
out
a
bank
bill
of
#
20
and
eleven
guineas
,
which
I
*NL*
told
him
I
had
saved
out
of
my
little
income
,
and
that
by
the
account
*NL*
that
creature
had
given
me
of
the
way
of
living
in
that
country
,
I
*NL*
expected
it
would
maintain
me
three
or
four
years
;
that
if
it
was
taken
*NL*
from
me
,
I
was
left
destitute
,
and
he
knew
what
the
condition
of
a
*NL*
woman
among
strangers
must
be
,
if
she
had
no
money
in
her
pocket
;
*NL*
however
,
I
told
him
,
if
he
would
take
it
,
there
it
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
told
me
with
a
great
concern
,
and
I
thought
I
saw
tears
stand
in
his
*NL*
eyes
,
that
he
would
not
touch
it
;
that
he
abhorred
the
thoughts
of
*NL*
stripping
me
and
make
me
miserable
;
that
,
on
the
contrary
,
he
had
fifty
*NL*
guineas
left
,
which
was
all
he
had
in
the
world
,
and
he
pulled
it
out
*NL*
and
threw
it
down
on
the
table
,
bidding
me
take
it
,
though
he
were
to
*NL*
starve
for
want
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
returned
,
with
the
same
concern
for
him
,
that
I
could
not
bear
to
*NL*
hear
him
talk
so
;
that
,
on
the
contrary
,
if
he
could
propose
any
*NL*
probable
method
of
living
,
I
would
do
anything
that
became
me
on
my
*NL*
part
,
and
that
I
would
live
as
close
and
as
narrow
as
he
could
desire
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
begged
of
me
to
talk
no
more
at
that
rate
,
for
it
would
make
him
*NL*
distracted
;
he
said
he
was
bred
a
gentleman
,
though
he
was
reduced
to
a
*NL*
low
fortune
,
and
that
there
was
but
one
way
left
which
he
could
think
*NL*
of
,
and
that
would
not
do
,
unless
I
could
answer
him
one
question
,
*NL*
which
,
however
,
he
said
he
would
not
press
me
to
.
I
told
him
I
would
*NL*
answer
it
honestly
;
whether
it
would
be
to
his
satisfaction
or
not
,
*NL*
that
I
could
not
tell
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
then
,
my
dear
,
tell
me
plainly
,
'
says
he
,
`
will
the
little
you
*NL*
have
keep
us
together
in
any
figure
,
or
in
any
station
or
place
,
or
*NL*
will
it
not
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
my
happiness
hitherto
that
I
had
not
discovered
myself
or
my
*NL*
circumstances
at
all
--
no
,
not
so
much
as
my
name
;
and
seeing
these
was
*NL*
nothing
to
be
expected
from
him
,
however
good-humoured
and
however
*NL*
honest
he
seemed
to
be
,
but
to
live
on
what
I
knew
would
soon
be
*NL*
wasted
,
I
resolved
to
conceal
everything
but
the
bank
bill
and
the
*NL*
eleven
guineas
which
I
had
owned
;
and
I
would
have
been
very
glad
to
*NL*
have
lost
that
and
have
been
set
down
where
he
took
me
up
.
I
had
*NL*
indeed
another
bank
bill
about
me
of
#
30
,
which
was
the
whole
of
what
I
*NL*
brought
with
me
,
as
well
to
subsist
on
in
the
country
,
as
not
knowing
*NL*
what
might
offer
;
because
this
creature
,
the
go-between
that
had
thus
*NL*
betrayed
us
both
,
had
made
me
believe
strange
things
of
my
marrying
to
*NL*
my
advantage
in
the
country
,
and
I
was
not
willing
to
be
without
money
,
*NL*
whatever
might
happen
.
This
bill
I
concealed
,
and
that
made
me
the
*NL*
freer
of
the
rest
,
in
consideration
of
his
circumstances
,
for
I
really
*NL*
pitied
him
heartily
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
to
return
to
his
question
,
I
told
him
I
never
willingly
deceived
*NL*
him
,
and
I
never
would
.
I
was
very
sorry
to
tell
him
that
the
little
I
*NL*
had
would
not
subsist
us
;
that
it
was
not
sufficient
to
subsist
me
*NL*
alone
in
the
south
country
,
and
that
this
was
the
reason
that
made
me
*NL*
put
myself
into
the
hands
of
that
woman
who
called
him
brother
,
she
*NL*
having
assured
me
that
I
might
board
very
handsomely
at
a
town
called
*NL*
Manchester
,
where
I
had
not
yet
been
,
for
about
#
6
a
year
;
and
my
whole
*NL*
income
not
being
about
#
15
a
year
,
I
thought
I
might
live
easy
upon
it
,
*NL*
and
wait
for
better
things
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
shook
his
head
and
remained
silent
,
and
a
very
melancholy
evening
we
*NL*
had
;
however
,
we
supped
together
,
and
lay
together
that
night
,
and
when
*NL*
we
had
almost
supped
he
looked
a
little
better
and
more
cheerful
,
and
*NL*
called
for
a
bottle
of
wine
.
`
Come
,
my
dear
,
'
says
he
,
`
though
the
*NL*
case
is
bad
,
it
is
to
no
purpose
to
be
dejected
.
Come
,
be
as
easy
as
*NL*
you
can
;
I
will
endeavour
to
find
out
some
way
or
other
to
live
;
if
you
*NL*
can
but
subsist
yourself
,
that
is
better
than
nothing
.
I
must
try
the
*NL*
world
again
;
a
man
ought
to
think
like
a
man
;
to
be
discouraged
is
to
*NL*
yield
to
the
misfortune
.
'
With
this
he
filled
a
glass
and
drank
to
me
,
*NL*
holding
my
hand
and
pressing
it
hard
in
his
hand
all
the
while
the
wine
*NL*
went
down
,
and
protesting
afterwards
his
main
concern
was
for
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
really
a
true
,
gallant
spirit
he
was
of
,
and
it
was
the
more
*NL*
grievous
to
me
.
'T
is
something
of
relief
even
to
be
undone
by
a
man
of
*NL*
honour
,
rather
than
by
a
scoundrel
;
but
here
the
greatest
*NL*
disappointment
was
on
his
side
,
for
he
had
really
spent
a
great
deal
of
*NL*
money
,
deluded
by
this
madam
the
procuress
;
and
it
was
very
remarkable
*NL*
on
what
poor
terms
he
proceeded
.
First
the
baseness
of
the
creature
*NL*
herself
is
to
be
observed
,
who
,
for
the
getting
#
100
herself
,
could
be
*NL*
content
to
let
him
spend
three
or
four
more
,
though
perhaps
it
was
all
*NL*
he
had
in
the
world
,
and
more
than
all
;
when
she
had
not
the
least
*NL*
ground
,
more
than
a
little
tea-table
chat
,
to
say
that
I
had
any
*NL*
estate
,
or
was
a
fortune
,
or
the
like
.
It
is
true
the
design
of
*NL*
deluding
a
woman
of
fortune
,
if
I
had
been
so
,
was
base
enough
;
the
*NL*
putting
the
face
of
great
things
upon
poor
circumstances
was
a
fraud
,
*NL*
and
bad
enough
;
but
the
case
a
little
differed
too
,
and
that
in
his
*NL*
favour
,
for
he
was
not
a
rake
that
made
a
trade
to
delude
women
,
and
,
*NL*
as
some
have
done
,
get
six
or
seven
fortunes
after
one
another
,
and
*NL*
then
rifle
and
run
away
from
them
;
but
he
was
really
a
gentleman
,
*NL*
unfortunate
and
low
,
but
had
lived
well
;
and
though
,
if
I
had
had
a
*NL*
fortune
,
I
should
have
been
enraged
at
the
slut
for
betraying
me
,
yet
*NL*
really
for
the
man
,
a
fortune
would
not
have
been
ill
bestowed
on
him
,
*NL*
for
he
was
a
lovely
person
indeed
,
of
generous
principles
,
good
sense
,
*NL*
and
of
abundance
of
good-humour
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
a
great
deal
of
close
conversation
that
night
,
for
we
neither
of
*NL*
us
slept
much
;
he
was
as
penitent
for
having
put
all
those
cheats
upon
*NL*
me
as
if
it
had
been
felony
,
and
that
he
was
going
to
execution
;
he
*NL*
offered
me
again
every
shilling
of
the
money
he
had
about
him
,
and
said
*NL*
he
would
go
into
the
army
and
seek
the
world
for
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
asked
him
why
he
would
be
so
unkind
to
carry
me
into
Ireland
,
when
I
*NL*
might
suppose
he
could
not
have
subsisted
me
there
.
He
took
me
in
his
*NL*
arms
.
`
My
dear
,
'
said
he
,
`
depend
upon
it
,
I
never
designed
to
go
to
*NL*
Ireland
at
all
,
much
less
to
have
carried
you
thither
,
but
came
hither
*NL*
to
be
out
of
the
observation
of
the
people
,
who
had
heard
what
I
*NL*
pretended
to
,
and
withal
,
that
nobody
might
ask
me
for
money
before
I
*NL*
was
furnished
to
supply
them
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
where
,
then
,
'
said
I
,
`
were
we
to
have
gone
next
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
my
dear
,
'
said
he
,
`
I
'll
confess
the
whole
scheme
to
you
as
I
had
*NL*
laid
it
;
I
purposed
here
to
ask
you
something
about
your
estate
,
as
you
*NL*
see
I
did
,
and
when
you
,
as
I
expected
you
would
,
had
entered
into
some
*NL*
account
with
me
of
the
particulars
,
I
would
have
made
an
excuse
to
you
*NL*
to
have
put
off
our
voyage
to
Ireland
for
some
time
,
and
to
have
gone
*NL*
first
towards
London
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Then
,
my
dear
,
'
said
he
,
'
I
resolved
to
have
confessed
all
the
*NL*
circumstances
of
my
own
affairs
to
you
,
and
let
you
know
I
had
indeed
*NL*
made
use
of
these
artifices
to
obtain
your
consent
to
marry
me
,
but
had
*NL*
now
nothing
to
do
but
ask
to
your
pardon
,
and
to
tell
you
how
*NL*
abundantly
,
as
I
have
said
above
,
I
would
endeavour
to
make
you
forget
*NL*
what
was
past
,
by
the
felicity
of
the
days
to
come
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Truly
,
'
said
I
to
him
,
'
I
find
you
would
soon
have
conquered
me
;
and
*NL*
it
is
my
affliction
now
,
that
I
am
not
in
a
condition
to
let
you
see
*NL*
how
easily
I
should
have
been
reconciled
to
you
,
and
have
passed
by
all
*NL*
the
tricks
you
had
put
upon
me
,
in
recompense
of
so
much
good-humour
.
*NL*
But
,
my
dear
,
'
said
I
,
`
what
can
we
do
now
?
We
are
both
undone
,
and
*NL*
what
better
are
we
for
our
being
reconciled
together
,
seeing
we
have
*NL*
nothing
to
live
on
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
We
proposed
a
great
many
things
,
but
nothing
could
offer
where
there
*NL*
was
nothing
to
begin
with
.
He
begged
me
at
last
to
talk
no
more
of
it
,
*NL*
for
,
he
said
,
I
would
break
his
heart
;
so
we
talked
of
other
things
a
*NL*
little
,
till
at
last
he
took
a
husband
's
leave
of
me
,
and
so
we
went
to
*NL*
sleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
rose
before
me
in
the
morning
;
and
indeed
,
having
lain
awake
almost
*NL*
all
night
,
I
was
very
sleepy
,
and
lay
till
near
eleven
o'clock
.
In
*NL*
this
time
he
took
his
horses
and
three
servants
,
and
all
his
linen
and
*NL*
baggage
,
and
away
he
went
,
leaving
a
short
but
moving
letter
for
me
on
*NL*
the
table
,
as
follows
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
`
MY
DEAR
--
I
am
a
dog
;
I
have
abused
you
;
but
I
have
been
drawn
into
do
*NL*
it
by
a
base
creature
,
contrary
to
my
principle
and
the
general
*NL*
practice
of
my
life
.
Forgive
me
,
my
dear
!
I
ask
your
pardon
with
the
*NL*
greatest
sincerity
;
I
am
the
most
miserable
of
men
,
in
having
deluded
*NL*
you
.
I
have
been
so
happy
to
possess
you
,
and
now
am
so
wretched
as
to
*NL*
be
forced
to
fly
from
you
.
Forgive
me
,
my
dear
;
once
more
I
say
,
*NL*
forgive
me
!
I
am
not
able
to
see
you
ruined
by
me
,
and
myself
unable
*NL*
to
support
you
.
Our
marriage
is
nothing
;
I
shall
never
be
able
to
see
*NL*
you
again
;
I
here
discharge
you
from
it
;
if
you
can
marry
to
your
*NL*
advantage
,
do
not
decline
it
on
my
account
;
I
here
swear
to
you
on
my
*NL*
faith
,
and
on
the
word
of
a
man
of
honour
,
I
will
never
disturb
your
*NL*
repose
if
I
should
know
of
it
,
which
,
however
,
is
not
likely
.
On
the
*NL*
other
hand
,
if
you
should
not
marry
,
and
if
good
fortune
should
befall
*NL*
me
,
it
shall
be
all
yours
,
wherever
you
are
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
have
put
some
of
the
stock
of
money
I
have
left
into
your
pocket
;
*NL*
take
places
for
yourself
and
your
maid
in
the
stage-coach
,
and
go
for
*NL*
London
;
I
hope
it
will
bear
your
charges
thither
,
without
breaking
into
*NL*
your
own
.
Again
I
sincerely
ask
your
pardon
,
and
will
do
so
as
often
*NL*
as
I
shall
ever
think
of
you
.
Adieu
,
my
dear
,
for
ever
!
--
I
am
,
your
*NL*
most
affectionately
,
J.E.
'
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
that
ever
befell
me
in
my
life
sank
so
deep
into
my
heart
as
*NL*
this
farewell
.
I
reproached
him
a
thousand
times
in
my
thoughts
for
*NL*
leaving
me
,
for
I
would
have
gone
with
him
through
the
world
,
if
I
had
*NL*
begged
my
bread
.
I
felt
in
my
pocket
,
and
there
found
ten
guineas
,
his
*NL*
gold
watch
,
and
two
little
rings
,
one
a
small
diamond
ring
worth
only
*NL*
about
#
6
,
and
the
other
a
plain
gold
ring
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
sat
me
down
and
looked
upon
these
things
two
hours
together
,
and
*NL*
scarce
spoke
a
word
,
till
my
maid
interrupted
me
by
telling
me
my
*NL*
dinner
was
ready
.
I
ate
but
little
,
and
after
dinner
I
fell
into
a
*NL*
vehement
fit
of
crying
,
every
now
and
then
calling
him
by
his
name
,
*NL*
which
was
James
.
'
O
Jemmy
!
'
said
I
,
`
come
back
,
come
back
.
I
'll
give
*NL*
you
all
I
have
;
I
'll
beg
,
I
'll
starve
with
you
.
'
And
thus
I
ran
raving
*NL*
about
the
room
several
times
,
and
then
sat
down
between
whiles
,
and
*NL*
then
walking
about
again
,
called
upon
him
to
come
back
,
and
then
cried
*NL*
again
;
and
thus
I
passed
the
afternoon
,
till
about
seven
o'clock
,
when
*NL*
it
was
near
dusk
,
in
the
evening
,
being
August
,
when
,
to
my
unspeakable
*NL*
surprise
,
he
comes
back
into
the
inn
,
but
without
a
servant
,
and
comes
*NL*
directly
up
into
my
chamber
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
in
the
greatest
confusion
imaginable
,
and
so
was
he
too
.
I
could
*NL*
not
imagine
what
should
be
the
occasion
of
it
,
and
began
to
be
at
odds
*NL*
with
myself
whether
to
be
glad
or
sorry
;
but
my
affection
biassed
all
*NL*
the
rest
,
and
it
was
impossible
to
conceal
my
joy
,
which
was
too
great
*NL*
for
smiles
,
for
it
burst
out
into
tears
.
He
was
no
sooner
entered
the
*NL*
room
but
he
ran
to
me
and
took
me
in
his
arms
,
holding
me
fast
,
and
*NL*
almost
stopping
my
breath
with
his
kisses
,
but
spoke
not
a
word
.
At
*NL*
length
I
began
.
`
My
dear
,
'
said
I
,
`
how
could
you
go
away
from
me
?
'
to
*NL*
which
he
gave
no
answer
,
for
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
our
ecstasies
were
a
little
over
,
he
told
me
he
was
gone
about
*NL*
fifteen
miles
,
but
it
was
not
in
his
power
to
go
any
farther
without
*NL*
coming
back
to
see
me
again
,
and
to
take
his
leave
of
me
once
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
told
him
how
I
had
passed
my
time
,
and
how
loud
I
had
called
him
to
*NL*
come
back
again
.
He
told
me
he
heard
me
very
plain
upon
Delamere
*NL*
Forest
,
at
a
place
about
twelve
miles
off
.
I
smiled
.
`
Nay
,
'
says
he
,
*NL*
`
do
not
think
I
am
in
jest
,
for
if
ever
I
heard
your
voice
in
my
life
,
*NL*
I
heard
you
call
me
aloud
,
and
sometimes
I
thought
I
saw
you
running
*NL*
after
me
.
'
`
Why
,
'
said
I
,
`
what
did
I
say
?
'
--
for
I
had
not
named
the
*NL*
words
to
him
.
`
You
called
aloud
,
'
says
he
,
`
and
said
,
O
Jemmy
!
O
*NL*
Jemmy
!
come
back
,
come
back
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
laughed
at
him
.
`
My
dear
,
'
says
he
,
`
do
not
laugh
,
for
,
depend
upon
*NL*
it
,
I
heard
your
voice
as
plain
as
you
hear
mine
now
;
if
you
please
,
*NL*
I
'll
go
before
a
magistrate
and
make
oath
of
it
.
'
I
then
began
to
be
*NL*
amazed
and
surprised
,
and
indeed
frightened
,
and
told
him
what
I
had
*NL*
really
done
,
and
how
I
had
called
after
him
,
as
above
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
had
amused
ourselves
a
while
about
this
,
I
said
to
him
:
`
Well
,
*NL*
you
shall
go
away
from
me
no
more
;
I
'll
go
all
over
the
world
with
you
*NL*
rather
.
'
He
told
me
it
would
be
a
very
difficult
thing
for
him
to
leave
*NL*
me
,
but
since
it
must
be
,
he
hoped
I
would
make
it
as
easy
to
me
as
I
*NL*
could
;
but
as
for
him
,
it
would
be
his
destruction
that
he
foresaw
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
he
told
me
that
he
considered
he
had
left
me
to
travel
to
*NL*
London
alone
,
which
was
too
long
a
journey
;
and
that
as
he
might
as
*NL*
well
go
that
way
as
any
way
else
,
he
was
resolved
to
see
me
safe
*NL*
thither
,
or
near
it
;
and
if
he
did
go
away
then
without
taking
his
*NL*
leave
,
I
should
not
take
it
ill
of
him
;
and
this
he
made
me
promise
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
told
me
how
he
had
dismissed
his
three
servants
,
sold
their
horses
,
*NL*
and
sent
the
fellows
away
to
seek
their
fortunes
,
and
all
in
a
little
*NL*
time
,
at
a
town
on
the
road
,
I
know
not
where
.
`
And
,
'
says
he
,
`
it
*NL*
cost
me
some
tears
all
alone
by
myself
,
to
think
how
much
happier
they
*NL*
were
than
their
master
,
for
they
could
go
to
the
next
gentleman
's
house
*NL*
to
see
for
a
service
,
whereas
,
'
said
he
,
'
I
knew
not
wither
to
go
,
or
*NL*
what
to
do
with
myself
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
told
him
I
was
so
completely
miserable
in
parting
with
him
,
that
I
*NL*
could
not
be
worse
;
and
that
now
he
was
come
again
,
I
would
not
go
from
*NL*
him
,
if
he
would
take
me
with
him
,
let
him
go
whither
he
would
,
or
do
*NL*
what
he
would
.
And
in
the
meantime
I
agreed
that
we
would
go
together
*NL*
to
London
;
but
I
could
not
be
brought
to
consent
he
should
go
away
at
*NL*
last
and
not
take
his
leave
of
me
,
as
he
proposed
to
do
;
but
told
him
,
*NL*
jesting
,
that
if
he
did
,
I
would
call
him
back
again
as
loud
as
I
did
*NL*
before
.
Then
I
pulled
out
his
watch
and
gave
it
him
back
,
and
his
two
*NL*
rings
,
and
his
ten
guineas
;
but
he
would
not
take
them
,
which
made
me
*NL*
very
much
suspect
that
he
resolved
to
go
off
upon
the
road
and
leave
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
truth
is
,
the
circumstances
he
was
in
,
the
passionate
expressions
*NL*
of
his
letter
,
the
kind
,
gentlemanly
treatment
I
had
from
him
in
all
*NL*
the
affair
,
with
the
concern
he
showed
for
me
in
it
,
his
manner
of
*NL*
parting
with
that
large
share
which
he
gave
me
of
his
little
stock
*NL*
left
--
all
these
had
joined
to
make
such
impressions
on
me
,
that
I
*NL*
really
loved
him
most
tenderly
,
and
could
not
bear
the
thoughts
of
*NL*
parting
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
days
after
this
we
quitted
Chester
,
I
in
the
stage-coach
,
and
he
on
*NL*
horseback
.
I
dismissed
my
maid
at
Chester
.
He
was
very
much
against
*NL*
my
being
without
a
maid
,
but
she
being
a
servant
hired
in
the
country
,
*NL*
and
I
resolving
to
keep
no
servant
at
London
,
I
told
him
it
would
have
*NL*
been
barbarous
to
have
taken
the
poor
wench
and
have
turned
her
away
as
*NL*
soon
as
I
came
to
town
;
and
it
would
also
have
been
a
needless
charge
*NL*
on
the
road
,
so
I
satisfied
him
,
and
he
was
easy
enough
on
the
score
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
came
with
me
as
far
as
Dunstable
,
within
thirty
miles
of
London
,
and
*NL*
then
he
told
me
fate
and
his
own
misfortunes
obliged
him
to
leave
me
,
*NL*
and
that
it
was
not
convenient
for
him
to
go
to
London
,
for
reasons
*NL*
which
it
was
of
no
value
to
me
to
know
,
and
I
saw
him
preparing
to
go
.
*NL*
The
stage-coach
we
were
in
did
not
usually
stop
at
Dunstable
,
but
I
*NL*
desiring
it
but
for
a
quart
of
an
hour
,
they
were
content
to
stand
at
*NL*
an
inndoor
a
while
,
and
we
went
into
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
Being
in
the
inn
,
I
told
him
I
had
but
one
favour
more
to
ask
of
him
,
*NL*
and
that
was
,
that
since
he
could
not
go
any
farther
,
he
would
give
me
*NL*
leave
to
stay
a
week
or
two
in
the
town
with
him
,
that
we
might
in
that
*NL*
time
think
of
something
to
prevent
such
a
ruinous
thing
to
us
both
,
as
*NL*
a
final
separation
would
be
;
and
that
I
had
something
of
moment
to
*NL*
offer
him
,
that
I
had
never
said
yet
,
and
which
perhaps
he
might
find
*NL*
practicable
to
our
mutual
advantage
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
too
reasonable
a
proposal
to
be
denied
,
so
he
called
the
*NL*
landlady
of
the
house
,
and
told
her
his
wife
was
taken
ill
,
and
so
ill
*NL*
that
she
could
not
think
of
going
any
farther
in
the
stage-coach
,
which
*NL*
had
tired
her
almost
to
death
,
and
asked
if
she
could
not
get
us
a
*NL*
lodging
for
two
or
three
days
in
a
private
house
,
where
I
might
rest
me
*NL*
a
little
,
for
the
journey
had
been
too
much
for
me
.
The
landlady
,
a
*NL*
good
sort
of
woman
,
well-bred
and
very
obliging
,
came
immediately
to
*NL*
see
me
;
told
me
she
had
two
or
three
very
good
rooms
in
a
part
of
the
*NL*
house
quite
out
of
the
noise
,
and
if
I
saw
them
,
she
did
not
doubt
but
*NL*
I
would
like
them
,
and
I
should
have
one
of
her
maids
,
that
should
do
*NL*
nothing
else
but
be
appointed
to
wait
on
me
.
This
was
so
very
kind
,
*NL*
that
I
could
not
but
accept
of
it
,
and
thank
her
;
so
I
went
to
look
on
*NL*
the
rooms
and
liked
them
very
well
,
and
indeed
they
were
*NL*
extraordinarily
furnished
,
and
very
pleasant
lodgings
;
so
we
paid
the
*NL*
stage-coach
,
took
out
our
baggage
,
and
resolved
to
stay
here
a
while
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
I
told
him
I
would
live
with
him
now
till
all
my
money
was
spent
,
*NL*
but
would
not
let
him
spend
a
shilling
of
his
own
.
We
had
some
kind
*NL*
squabble
about
that
,
but
I
told
him
it
was
the
last
time
I
was
like
to
*NL*
enjoy
his
company
,
and
I
desired
he
would
let
me
be
master
in
that
*NL*
thing
only
,
and
he
should
govern
in
everything
else
;
so
he
acquiesced
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
one
evening
,
taking
a
walk
into
the
fields
,
I
told
him
I
would
now
*NL*
make
the
proposal
to
him
I
had
told
him
of
;
accordingly
I
related
to
*NL*
him
how
I
had
lived
in
Virginia
,
that
I
had
a
mother
I
believed
was
*NL*
alive
there
still
,
though
my
husband
was
dead
some
years
.
I
told
him
*NL*
that
had
not
my
effects
miscarried
,
which
,
by
the
way
,
I
magnified
*NL*
pretty
much
,
I
might
have
been
fortune
good
enough
to
him
to
have
kept
*NL*
us
from
being
parted
in
this
manner
.
Then
I
entered
into
the
manner
of
*NL*
peoples
going
over
to
those
countries
to
settle
,
how
they
had
a
*NL*
quantity
of
land
given
them
by
the
Constitution
of
the
place
;
and
if
*NL*
not
,
that
it
might
be
purchased
at
so
easy
a
rate
this
it
was
not
worth
*NL*
naming
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
then
gave
him
a
full
and
distinct
account
of
the
nature
of
planting
;
*NL*
how
with
carrying
over
but
two
or
three
hundred
pounds
value
in
English
*NL*
goods
,
with
some
servants
and
tools
,
a
man
of
application
would
*NL*
presently
lay
a
foundation
for
a
family
,
and
in
a
very
few
years
be
*NL*
certain
to
raise
an
estate
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
let
him
into
the
nature
of
the
product
of
the
earth
;
how
the
ground
*NL*
was
cured
and
prepared
,
and
what
the
usual
increase
of
it
was
;
and
*NL*
demonstrated
to
him
,
that
in
a
very
few
years
,
with
such
a
beginning
,
*NL*
we
should
be
as
certain
of
being
rich
as
we
were
now
certain
of
being
*NL*
poor
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
surprised
at
my
discourse
;
for
we
made
it
the
whole
subject
of
*NL*
our
conversation
for
near
a
week
together
,
in
which
time
I
laid
it
down
*NL*
in
black
and
white
,
as
we
say
,
that
it
was
morally
impossible
,
with
a
*NL*
supposition
of
any
reasonable
good
conduct
,
but
that
we
must
thrive
*NL*
there
and
do
very
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
I
told
him
what
measures
I
would
take
to
raise
such
a
sum
of
#
300
*NL*
or
thereabouts
;
and
I
argued
with
him
how
good
a
method
it
would
be
to
*NL*
put
an
end
to
our
misfortunes
and
restore
our
circumstances
in
the
*NL*
world
,
to
what
we
had
both
expected
;
and
I
added
,
that
after
seven
*NL*
years
,
if
we
lived
,
we
might
be
in
a
posture
to
leave
our
plantations
*NL*
in
good
hands
,
and
come
over
again
and
receive
the
income
of
it
,
and
*NL*
live
here
and
enjoy
it
;
and
I
gave
him
examples
of
some
that
had
done
*NL*
so
,
and
lived
now
in
very
good
circumstances
in
London
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
short
,
I
pressed
him
so
to
it
,
that
he
almost
agreed
to
it
,
but
*NL*
still
something
or
other
broke
it
off
again
;
till
at
last
he
turned
the
*NL*
tables
,
and
he
began
to
talk
almost
to
the
same
purpose
of
Ireland
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
told
me
that
a
man
that
could
confine
himself
to
country
life
,
and
*NL*
that
could
find
but
stock
to
enter
upon
any
land
,
should
have
farms
*NL*
there
for
#
50
a
year
,
as
good
as
were
here
let
for
#
200
a
year
;
that
*NL*
the
produce
was
such
,
and
so
rich
the
land
,
that
if
much
was
not
laid
*NL*
up
,
we
were
sure
to
live
as
handsomely
upon
it
as
a
gentleman
of
#
3000
*NL*
a
year
could
do
in
England
and
that
he
had
laid
a
scheme
to
leave
me
in
*NL*
London
,
and
go
over
and
try
;
and
if
he
found
he
could
lay
a
handsome
*NL*
foundation
of
living
suitable
to
the
respect
he
had
for
me
,
as
he
*NL*
doubted
not
he
should
do
,
he
would
come
over
and
fetch
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
dreadfully
afraid
that
upon
such
a
proposal
he
would
have
taken
*NL*
me
at
my
word
,
viz
.
to
sell
my
little
income
as
I
called
it
,
and
turn
*NL*
it
into
money
,
and
let
him
carry
it
over
into
Ireland
and
try
his
*NL*
experiment
with
it
;
but
he
was
too
just
to
desire
it
,
or
to
have
*NL*
accepted
it
if
I
had
offered
it
;
and
he
anticipated
me
in
that
,
for
he
*NL*
added
,
that
he
would
go
and
try
his
fortune
that
way
,
and
if
he
found
*NL*
he
could
do
anything
at
it
to
live
,
then
,
by
adding
mine
to
it
when
I
*NL*
went
over
,
we
should
live
like
ourselves
;
but
that
he
would
not
hazard
*NL*
a
shilling
of
mine
till
he
had
made
the
experiment
with
a
little
,
and
*NL*
he
assured
me
that
if
he
found
nothing
to
be
done
in
Ireland
,
he
would
*NL*
then
come
to
me
and
join
in
my
project
for
Virginia
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
so
earnest
upon
his
project
being
to
be
tried
first
,
that
I
*NL*
could
not
withstand
him
;
however
,
he
promised
to
let
me
hear
from
him
*NL*
in
a
very
little
time
after
his
arriving
there
,
to
let
me
know
whether
*NL*
his
prospect
answered
his
design
,
that
if
there
was
not
a
possibility
*NL*
of
success
,
I
might
take
the
occasion
to
prepare
for
our
other
voyage
,
*NL*
and
then
,
he
assured
me
,
he
would
go
with
me
to
America
with
all
his
*NL*
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
bring
him
to
nothing
further
than
this
.
However
,
those
*NL*
consultations
entertained
us
near
a
month
,
during
which
I
enjoyed
his
*NL*
company
,
which
indeed
was
the
most
entertaining
that
ever
I
met
in
my
*NL*
life
before
.
In
this
time
he
let
me
into
the
whole
story
of
his
own
*NL*
life
,
which
was
indeed
surprising
,
and
full
of
an
infinite
variety
*NL*
sufficient
to
fill
up
a
much
brighter
history
,
for
its
adventures
and
*NL*
incidents
,
than
any
I
ever
say
in
print
;
but
I
shall
have
occasion
to
*NL*
say
more
of
him
hereafter
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
parted
at
last
,
though
with
the
utmost
reluctance
on
my
side
;
and
*NL*
indeed
he
took
his
leave
very
unwillingly
too
,
but
necessity
obliged
*NL*
him
,
for
his
reasons
were
very
good
why
he
would
not
come
to
London
,
as
*NL*
I
understood
more
fully
some
time
afterwards
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
gave
him
a
direction
how
to
write
to
me
,
though
still
I
reserved
the
*NL*
grand
secret
,
and
never
broke
my
resolution
,
which
was
not
to
let
him
*NL*
ever
know
my
true
name
,
who
I
was
,
or
where
to
be
found
;
he
likewise
*NL*
let
me
know
how
to
write
a
letter
to
him
,
so
that
,
he
said
,
he
would
be
*NL*
sure
to
receive
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
came
to
London
the
next
day
after
we
parted
,
but
did
not
go
directly
*NL*
to
my
old
lodgings
;
but
for
another
nameless
reason
took
a
private
*NL*
lodging
in
St.
John
's
Street
,
or
,
as
it
is
vulgarly
called
,
St.
*NL*
Jones
's
,
near
Clerkenwell
;
and
here
,
being
perfectly
alone
,
I
had
*NL*
leisure
to
sit
down
and
reflect
seriously
upon
the
last
seven
months
'
*NL*
ramble
I
had
made
,
for
I
had
been
abroad
no
less
.
The
pleasant
hours
I
*NL*
had
with
my
last
husband
I
looked
back
on
with
an
infinite
deal
of
*NL*
pleasure
;
but
that
pleasure
was
very
much
lessened
when
I
found
some
*NL*
time
after
that
I
was
really
with
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
a
perplexing
thing
,
because
of
the
difficulty
which
was
before
*NL*
me
where
I
should
get
leave
to
lie
in
;
it
being
one
of
the
nicest
*NL*
things
in
the
world
at
that
time
of
day
for
a
woman
that
was
a
*NL*
stranger
,
and
had
no
friends
,
to
be
entertained
in
that
circumstance
*NL*
without
security
,
which
,
by
the
way
,
I
had
not
,
neither
could
I
procure
*NL*
any
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
taken
care
all
this
while
to
preserve
a
correspondence
with
my
*NL*
honest
friend
at
the
bank
,
or
rather
he
took
care
to
correspond
with
*NL*
me
,
for
he
wrote
to
me
once
a
week
;
and
though
I
had
not
spent
my
money
*NL*
so
fast
as
to
want
any
from
him
,
yet
I
often
wrote
also
to
let
him
know
*NL*
I
was
alive
.
I
had
left
directions
in
Lancashire
,
so
that
I
had
these
*NL*
letters
,
which
he
sent
,
conveyed
to
me
;
and
during
my
recess
at
St.
*NL*
Jones
's
received
a
very
obliging
letter
from
him
,
assuring
me
that
his
*NL*
process
for
a
divorce
from
his
wife
went
on
with
success
,
though
he
met
*NL*
with
some
difficulties
in
it
that
he
did
not
expect
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
not
displeased
with
the
news
that
his
process
was
more
tedious
*NL*
than
he
expected
;
for
though
I
was
in
no
condition
to
have
him
yet
,
not
*NL*
being
so
foolish
to
marry
him
when
I
knew
myself
to
be
with
child
by
*NL*
another
man
,
as
some
I
know
have
ventured
to
do
,
yet
I
was
not
willing
*NL*
to
lose
him
,
and
,
in
a
word
,
resolved
to
have
him
if
he
continued
in
*NL*
the
same
mind
,
as
soon
as
I
was
up
again
;
for
I
saw
apparently
I
should
*NL*
hear
no
more
from
my
husband
;
and
as
he
had
all
along
pressed
to
marry
,
*NL*
and
had
assured
me
he
would
not
be
at
all
disgusted
at
it
,
or
ever
*NL*
offer
to
claim
me
again
,
so
I
made
no
scruple
to
resolve
to
do
it
if
I
*NL*
could
,
and
if
my
other
friend
stood
to
his
bargain
;
and
I
had
a
great
*NL*
deal
of
reason
to
be
assured
that
he
would
stand
to
it
,
by
the
letters
*NL*
he
wrote
to
me
,
which
were
the
kindest
and
most
obliging
that
could
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
now
grew
big
,
and
the
people
where
I
lodged
perceived
it
,
and
began
*NL*
to
take
notice
of
it
to
me
,
and
,
as
far
as
civility
would
allow
,
*NL*
intimated
that
I
must
think
of
removing
.
This
put
me
to
extreme
*NL*
perplexity
,
and
I
grew
very
melancholy
,
for
indeed
I
knew
not
what
*NL*
course
to
take
.
I
had
money
,
but
no
friends
,
and
was
like
to
have
a
*NL*
child
upon
my
hands
to
keep
,
which
was
a
difficulty
I
had
never
had
*NL*
upon
me
yet
,
as
the
particulars
of
my
story
hitherto
make
appear
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
course
of
this
affair
I
fell
very
ill
,
and
my
melancholy
really
*NL*
increased
my
distemper
;
my
illness
proved
at
length
to
be
only
an
ague
,
*NL*
but
my
apprehensions
were
really
that
I
should
miscarry
.
I
should
not
*NL*
say
apprehensions
,
for
indeed
I
would
have
been
glad
to
miscarry
,
but
I
*NL*
could
never
be
brought
to
entertain
so
much
as
a
thought
of
*NL*
endeavouring
to
miscarry
,
or
of
taking
any
thing
to
make
me
miscarry
;
I
*NL*
abhorred
,
I
say
,
so
much
as
the
thought
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
speaking
of
it
in
the
house
,
the
gentlewoman
who
kept
the
*NL*
house
proposed
to
me
to
send
for
a
midwife
.
I
scrupled
it
at
first
,
*NL*
but
after
some
time
consented
to
it
,
but
told
her
I
had
no
particular
*NL*
acquaintance
with
any
midwife
,
and
so
left
it
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
seems
the
mistress
of
the
house
was
not
so
great
a
stranger
to
such
*NL*
cases
as
mine
was
as
I
thought
at
first
she
had
been
,
as
will
appear
*NL*
presently
,
and
she
sent
for
a
midwife
of
the
right
sort
--
that
is
to
*NL*
say
,
the
right
sort
for
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
woman
appeared
to
be
an
experienced
woman
in
her
business
,
I
mean
*NL*
as
a
midwife
;
but
she
had
another
calling
too
,
in
which
she
was
as
*NL*
expert
as
most
women
if
not
more
.
My
landlady
had
told
her
I
was
very
*NL*
melancholy
,
and
that
she
believed
that
had
done
me
harm
;
and
once
,
*NL*
before
me
,
said
to
her
,
`
Mrs.
B
--
'
-LRB-
meaning
the
midwife
-RRB-
,
'
I
believe
*NL*
this
lady
's
trouble
is
of
a
kind
that
is
pretty
much
in
your
way
,
and
*NL*
therefore
if
you
can
do
anything
for
her
,
pray
do
,
for
she
is
a
very
*NL*
civil
gentlewoman
'
;
and
so
she
went
out
of
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
really
did
not
understand
her
,
but
my
Mother
Midnight
began
very
*NL*
seriously
to
explain
what
she
mean
,
as
soon
as
she
was
gone
.
`
Madam
,
'
*NL*
says
she
,
`
you
seem
not
to
understand
what
your
landlady
means
;
and
*NL*
when
you
do
understand
it
,
you
need
not
let
her
know
at
all
that
you
do
*NL*
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
She
means
that
you
are
under
some
circumstances
that
may
render
your
*NL*
lying
in
difficult
to
you
,
and
that
you
are
not
willing
to
be
exposed
.
*NL*
I
need
say
no
more
,
but
to
tell
you
,
that
if
you
think
fit
to
*NL*
communicate
so
much
of
your
case
to
me
,
if
it
be
so
,
as
is
necessary
,
*NL*
for
I
do
not
desire
to
pry
into
those
things
,
I
perhaps
may
be
in
a
*NL*
position
to
help
you
and
to
make
you
perfectly
easy
,
and
remove
all
*NL*
your
dull
thoughts
upon
that
subject
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Every
word
this
creature
said
was
a
cordial
to
me
,
and
put
new
life
and
*NL*
new
spirit
into
my
heart
;
my
blood
began
to
circulate
immediately
,
and
*NL*
I
was
quite
another
body
;
I
ate
my
victuals
again
,
and
grew
better
*NL*
presently
after
it
.
She
said
a
great
deal
more
to
the
same
purpose
,
*NL*
and
then
,
having
pressed
me
to
be
free
with
her
,
and
promised
in
the
*NL*
solemnest
manner
to
be
secret
,
she
stopped
a
little
,
as
if
waiting
to
*NL*
see
what
impression
it
made
on
me
,
and
what
I
would
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
too
sensible
to
the
want
I
was
in
of
such
a
woman
,
not
to
accept
*NL*
her
offer
;
I
told
her
my
case
was
partly
as
she
guessed
,
and
partly
*NL*
not
,
for
I
was
really
married
,
and
had
a
husband
,
though
he
was
in
such
*NL*
fine
circumstances
and
so
remote
at
that
time
,
as
that
he
could
not
*NL*
appear
publicly
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
took
me
short
,
and
told
me
that
was
none
of
her
business
;
all
the
*NL*
ladies
that
came
under
her
care
were
married
women
to
her
.
`
Every
*NL*
woman
,
'
she
says
,
`
that
is
with
child
has
a
father
for
it
,
'
and
whether
*NL*
that
father
was
a
husband
or
no
husband
,
was
no
business
of
hers
;
her
*NL*
business
was
to
assist
me
in
my
present
circumstances
,
whether
I
had
a
*NL*
husband
or
no
.
`
For
,
madam
,
'
says
she
,
`
to
have
a
husband
that
can
not
*NL*
appear
,
is
to
have
no
husband
in
the
sense
of
the
case
;
and
,
therefore
,
*NL*
whether
you
are
a
wife
or
a
mistress
is
all
one
to
me
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
found
presently
,
that
whether
I
was
a
whore
or
a
wife
,
I
was
to
pass
*NL*
for
a
whore
here
,
so
I
let
that
go
.
I
told
her
it
was
true
,
as
she
*NL*
said
,
but
that
,
however
,
if
I
must
tell
her
my
case
,
I
must
tell
it
her
*NL*
as
it
was
;
so
I
related
it
to
her
as
short
as
I
could
,
and
I
concluded
*NL*
it
to
her
thus
.
'
I
trouble
you
with
all
this
,
madam
,
'
said
I
,
`
not
*NL*
that
,
as
you
said
before
,
it
is
much
to
the
purpose
in
your
affair
,
but
*NL*
this
is
to
the
purpose
,
namely
,
that
I
am
not
in
any
pain
about
being
*NL*
seen
,
or
being
public
or
concealed
,
for
't
is
perfectly
indifferent
to
*NL*
me
;
but
my
difficulty
is
,
that
I
have
no
acquaintance
in
this
part
of
*NL*
the
nation
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
understand
you
,
madam
'
says
she
;
`
you
have
no
security
to
bring
to
*NL*
prevent
the
parish
impertinences
usual
in
such
cases
,
and
perhaps
,
'
*NL*
says
she
,
`
do
not
know
very
well
how
to
dispose
of
the
child
when
it
*NL*
comes
.
'
`
The
last
,
'
says
I
,
`
is
not
so
much
my
concern
as
the
first
.
'
*NL*
`
Well
,
madam
,
'
answered
the
midwife
,
`
dare
you
put
yourself
into
my
*NL*
hands
?
I
live
in
such
a
place
;
though
I
do
not
inquire
after
you
,
you
*NL*
may
inquire
after
me
.
My
name
is
B
--
;
I
live
in
such
a
*NL*
street
'
--
naming
the
street
--
`
at
the
sign
of
the
Cradle
.
My
profession
*NL*
is
a
midwife
,
and
I
have
many
ladies
that
come
to
my
house
to
lie
in
.
*NL*
I
have
given
security
to
the
parish
in
general
terms
to
secure
them
*NL*
from
any
charge
from
whatsoever
shall
come
into
the
world
under
my
*NL*
roof
.
I
have
but
one
question
to
ask
in
the
whole
affair
,
madam
,
'
says
*NL*
she
,
`
and
if
that
be
answered
you
shall
be
entirely
easy
for
all
the
*NL*
rest
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
presently
understood
what
she
meant
,
and
told
her
,
`
Madam
,
I
believe
*NL*
I
understand
you
.
I
thank
God
,
though
I
want
friends
in
this
part
of
*NL*
the
world
,
I
do
not
want
money
,
so
far
as
may
be
necessary
,
though
I
do
*NL*
not
abound
in
that
neither
'
:
this
I
added
because
I
would
not
make
her
*NL*
expect
great
things
.
`
Well
,
madam
,
'
says
she
,
`
that
is
the
thing
*NL*
indeed
,
without
which
nothing
can
be
done
in
these
cases
;
and
yet
,
'
*NL*
says
she
,
`
you
shall
see
that
I
will
not
impose
upon
you
,
or
offer
*NL*
anything
that
is
unkind
to
you
,
and
if
you
desire
it
,
you
shall
know
*NL*
everything
beforehand
,
that
you
may
suit
yourself
to
the
occasion
,
and
*NL*
be
neither
costly
or
sparing
as
you
see
fit
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
told
her
she
seemed
to
be
so
perfectly
sensible
of
my
condition
,
that
*NL*
I
had
nothing
to
ask
of
her
but
this
,
that
as
I
had
told
her
that
I
had
*NL*
money
sufficient
,
but
not
a
great
quantity
,
she
would
order
it
so
that
*NL*
I
might
be
at
as
little
superfluous
charge
as
possible
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
replied
that
she
would
bring
in
an
account
of
the
expenses
of
it
in
*NL*
two
or
three
shapes
,
and
like
a
bill
of
fare
,
I
should
choose
as
I
*NL*
pleased
;
and
I
desired
her
to
do
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
she
brought
it

and
the
copy
of
her
three
bills
was
a

*NL*
*NL*
I
looked
upon
all
three
bills
,
and
smiled
,
and
told
her
I
did
not
see
*NL*
but
that
she
was
very
reasonable
in
her
demands
,
all
things
considered
,
*NL*
and
for
that
I
did
not
doubt
but
her
accommodations
were
good
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
told
me
I
should
be
judge
of
that
when
I
saw
them
.
I
told
her
I
*NL*
was
sorry
to
tell
her
that
I
feared
I
must
be
her
lowest-rated
*NL*
customer
.
`
And
perhaps
,
madam
,
'
said
I
,
`
you
will
make
me
the
less
*NL*
welcome
upon
that
account
.
'
`
No
,
not
at
all
,
'
said
she
;
`
for
where
I
*NL*
have
one
of
the
third
sort
I
have
two
of
the
second
,
and
four
to
one
of
*NL*
the
first
,
and
I
get
as
much
by
them
in
proportion
as
by
any
;
but
if
*NL*
you
doubt
my
care
of
you
,
I
will
allow
any
friend
you
have
to
overlook
*NL*
and
see
if
you
are
well
waited
on
or
no
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
explained
the
particulars
of
her
bill
.
`
In
the
first
place
,
*NL*
madam
,
'
said
she
,
'
I
would
have
you
observe
that
here
is
three
months
'
*NL*
keeping
;
you
are
but
ten
shillings
a
week
;
I
undertake
to
say
you
will
*NL*
not
complain
of
my
table
.
I
suppose
,
'
says
she
,
`
you
do
not
live
*NL*
cheaper
where
you
are
now
?
'
`
No
,
indeed
,
'
said
I
,
`
not
so
cheap
,
for
I
*NL*
give
six
shillings
per
week
for
my
chamber
,
and
find
my
own
diet
as
*NL*
well
as
I
can
,
which
costs
me
a
great
deal
more
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Then
,
madam
,
'
says
she
,
`
if
the
child
should
not
live
,
or
should
be
*NL*
dead-born
,
as
you
know
sometimes
happens
,
then
there
is
the
minister
's
*NL*
article
saved
;
and
if
you
have
no
friends
to
come
to
you
,
you
may
save
*NL*
the
expense
of
a
supper
;
so
that
take
those
articles
out
,
madam
,
'
says
*NL*
she
,
`
your
lying
in
will
not
cost
you
above
#
5
,
3s
.
in
all
more
than
*NL*
your
ordinary
charge
of
living
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
most
reasonable
thing
that
I
ever
heard
of
;
so
I
smiled
,
*NL*
and
told
her
I
would
come
and
be
her
customer
;
but
I
told
her
also
,
*NL*
that
as
I
had
two
months
and
more
to
do
,
I
might
perhaps
be
obliged
to
*NL*
stay
longer
with
her
than
three
months
,
and
desired
to
know
if
she
*NL*
would
not
be
obliged
to
remove
me
before
it
was
proper
.
No
,
she
said
;
*NL*
her
house
was
large
,
and
besides
,
she
never
put
anybody
to
remove
,
that
*NL*
had
lain
in
,
till
they
were
willing
to
go
;
and
if
she
had
more
ladies
*NL*
offered
,
she
was
not
so
ill-beloved
among
her
neighbours
but
she
could
*NL*
provide
accommodations
for
twenty
,
if
there
was
occasion
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
found
she
was
an
eminent
lady
in
her
way
;
and
,
in
short
,
I
agreed
to
*NL*
put
myself
into
her
hands
,
and
promised
her
.
She
then
talked
of
other
*NL*
things
,
looked
about
into
my
accommodations
where
I
was
,
found
fault
*NL*
with
my
wanting
attendance
and
conveniences
,
and
that
I
should
not
be
*NL*
used
so
at
her
house
.
I
told
her
I
was
shy
of
speaking
,
for
the
woman
*NL*
of
the
house
looked
stranger
,
or
at
least
I
thought
so
,
since
I
had
*NL*
been
ill
,
because
I
was
with
child
;
and
I
was
afraid
she
would
put
some
*NL*
affront
or
other
upon
me
,
supposing
that
I
had
been
able
to
give
but
a
*NL*
slight
account
of
myself
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
dear
,
'
said
she
,
`
her
ladyship
is
no
stranger
to
these
things
;
she
*NL*
has
tried
to
entertain
ladies
in
your
condition
several
times
,
but
she
*NL*
could
not
secure
the
parish
;
and
besides
,
she
is
not
such
a
nice
lady
*NL*
as
you
take
her
to
be
;
however
,
since
you
are
a-going
,
you
shall
not
*NL*
meddle
with
her
,
but
I
'll
see
you
are
a
little
better
looked
after
*NL*
while
you
are
here
than
I
think
you
are
,
and
it
shall
not
cost
you
the
*NL*
more
neither
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
did
not
understand
her
at
all
;
however
,
I
thanked
her
,
and
so
we
*NL*
parted
.
The
next
morning
she
sent
me
a
chicken
roasted
and
hot
,
and
a
*NL*
pint
bottle
of
sherry
,
and
ordered
the
maid
to
tell
me
that
she
was
to
*NL*
wait
on
me
every
day
as
long
as
I
stayed
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
surprisingly
good
and
kind
,
and
I
accepted
it
very
willingly
.
*NL*
At
night
she
sent
to
me
again
,
to
know
if
I
wanted
anything
,
and
how
I
*NL*
did
,
and
to
order
the
maid
to
come
to
her
in
the
morning
with
my
*NL*
dinner
.
The
maid
had
orders
to
make
me
some
chocolate
in
the
morning
*NL*
before
she
came
away
,
and
did
so
,
and
at
noon
she
brought
me
the
*NL*
sweetbread
of
a
breast
of
veal
,
whole
,
and
a
dish
of
soup
for
my
*NL*
dinner
;
and
after
this
manner
she
nursed
me
up
at
a
distance
,
so
that
I
*NL*
was
mightily
well
pleased
,
and
quickly
well
,
for
indeed
my
dejections
*NL*
before
were
the
principal
part
of
my
illness
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
expected
,
as
is
usually
the
case
among
such
people
,
that
the
servant
*NL*
she
sent
me
would
have
been
some
imprudent
brazen
wench
of
Drury
Lane
*NL*
breeding
,
and
I
was
very
uneasy
at
having
her
with
me
upon
that
*NL*
account
;
so
I
would
not
let
her
lie
in
that
house
the
first
night
by
*NL*
any
means
,
but
had
my
eyes
about
me
as
narrowly
as
if
she
had
been
a
*NL*
public
thief
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
gentlewoman
guessed
presently
what
was
the
matter
,
and
sent
her
back
*NL*
with
a
short
note
,
that
I
might
depend
upon
the
honesty
of
her
maid
;
*NL*
that
she
would
be
answerable
for
her
upon
all
accounts
;
and
that
she
*NL*
took
no
servants
into
her
house
without
very
good
security
for
their
*NL*
fidelity
.
I
was
then
perfectly
easy
;
and
indeed
the
maid
's
behaviour
*NL*
spoke
for
itself
,
for
a
modester
,
quieter
,
soberer
girl
never
came
into
*NL*
anybody
's
family
,
and
I
found
her
so
afterwards
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
I
was
well
enough
to
go
abroad
,
I
went
with
the
maid
to
see
*NL*
the
house
,
and
to
see
the
apartment
I
was
to
have
;
and
everything
was
*NL*
so
handsome
and
so
clean
and
well
,
that
,
in
short
,
I
had
nothing
to
*NL*
say
,
but
was
wonderfully
pleased
and
satisfied
with
what
I
had
met
*NL*
with
,
which
,
considering
the
melancholy
circumstances
I
was
in
,
was
far
*NL*
beyond
what
I
looked
for
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
might
be
expected
that
I
should
give
some
account
of
the
nature
of
*NL*
the
wicked
practices
of
this
woman
,
in
whose
hands
I
was
now
fallen
;
*NL*
but
it
would
be
too
much
encouragement
to
the
vice
,
to
let
the
world
*NL*
see
what
easy
measures
were
here
taken
to
rid
the
women
's
unwelcome
*NL*
burthen
of
a
child
clandestinely
gotten
.
This
grave
matron
had
several
*NL*
sorts
of
practice
,
and
this
was
one
particular
,
that
if
a
child
was
*NL*
born
,
though
not
in
her
house
-LRB-
for
she
had
occasion
to
be
called
to
*NL*
many
private
labours
-RRB-
,
she
had
people
at
hand
,
who
for
a
piece
of
money
*NL*
would
take
the
child
off
their
hands
,
and
off
from
the
hands
of
the
*NL*
parish
too
;
and
those
children
,
as
she
said
,
were
honestly
provided
for
*NL*
and
taken
care
of
.
What
should
become
of
them
all
,
considering
so
*NL*
many
,
as
by
her
account
she
was
concerned
with
,
I
can
not
conceive
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
many
times
discourses
upon
that
subject
with
her
;
but
she
was
*NL*
full
of
this
argument
,
that
she
save
the
life
of
many
an
innocent
lamb
,
*NL*
as
she
called
them
,
which
would
otherwise
perhaps
have
been
murdered
;
*NL*
and
of
many
women
who
,
made
desperate
by
the
misfortune
,
would
*NL*
otherwise
be
tempted
to
destroy
their
children
,
and
bring
themselves
to
*NL*
the
gallows
.
I
granted
her
that
this
was
true
,
and
a
very
commendable
*NL*
thing
,
provided
the
poor
children
fell
into
good
hands
afterwards
,
and
*NL*
were
not
abused
,
starved
,
and
neglected
by
the
nurses
that
bred
them
*NL*
up
.
She
answered
,
that
she
always
took
care
of
that
,
and
had
no
nurses
*NL*
in
her
business
but
what
were
very
good
,
honest
people
,
and
such
as
*NL*
might
be
depended
upon
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
say
nothing
to
the
contrary
,
and
so
was
obliged
to
say
,
`
Madam
,
*NL*
I
do
not
question
you
do
your
part
honestly
,
but
what
those
people
do
*NL*
afterwards
is
the
main
question
'
;
and
she
stopped
my
mouth
again
with
*NL*
saying
that
she
took
the
utmost
care
about
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
only
thing
I
found
in
all
her
conversation
on
these
subjects
that
*NL*
gave
me
any
distaste
,
was
,
that
one
time
in
discouraging
about
my
being
*NL*
far
gone
with
child
,
and
the
time
I
expected
to
come
,
she
said
*NL*
something
that
looked
as
if
she
could
help
me
off
with
my
burthen
*NL*
sooner
,
if
I
was
willing
;
or
,
in
English
,
that
she
could
give
me
*NL*
something
to
make
me
miscarry
,
if
I
had
a
desire
to
put
an
end
to
my
*NL*
troubles
that
way
;
but
I
soon
let
her
see
that
I
abhorred
the
thoughts
*NL*
of
it
;
and
,
to
do
her
justice
,
she
put
it
off
so
cleverly
,
that
I
could
*NL*
not
say
she
really
intended
it
,
or
whether
she
only
mentioned
the
*NL*
practice
as
a
horrible
thing
;
for
she
couched
her
words
so
well
,
and
*NL*
took
my
meaning
so
quickly
,
that
she
gave
her
negative
before
I
could
*NL*
explain
myself
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
bring
this
part
into
as
narrow
a
compass
as
possible
,
I
quitted
my
*NL*
lodging
at
St.
Jones
's
and
went
to
my
new
governess
,
for
so
they
called
*NL*
her
in
the
house
,
and
there
I
was
indeed
treated
with
so
much
courtesy
,
*NL*
so
carefully
looked
to
,
so
handsomely
provided
,
and
everything
so
well
,
*NL*
that
I
was
surprised
at
it
,
and
could
not
at
first
see
what
advantage
*NL*
my
governess
made
of
it
;
but
I
found
afterwards
that
she
professed
to
*NL*
make
no
profit
of
lodgers
'
diet
,
nor
indeed
could
she
get
much
by
it
,
*NL*
but
that
her
profit
lay
in
the
other
articles
of
her
management
,
and
*NL*
she
made
enough
that
way
,
I
assure
you
;
for
't
is
scarce
credible
what
*NL*
practice
she
had
,
as
well
abroad
as
at
home
,
and
yet
all
upon
the
*NL*
private
account
,
or
,
in
plain
English
,
the
whoring
account
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
I
was
in
her
house
,
which
was
near
four
months
,
she
had
no
less
*NL*
than
twelve
ladies
of
pleasure
brought
to
bed
within
the
doors
,
and
I
*NL*
think
she
had
two-and-thirty
,
or
thereabouts
,
under
her
conduct
without
*NL*
doors
,
whereof
one
,
as
nice
as
she
was
with
me
,
was
lodged
with
my
old
*NL*
landlady
at
St.
Jones
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
a
strange
testimony
of
the
growing
vice
of
the
age
,
and
such
a
*NL*
one
,
that
as
bad
as
I
had
been
myself
,
it
shocked
my
very
senses
.
I
*NL*
began
to
nauseate
the
place
I
was
in
and
,
about
all
,
the
wicked
*NL*
practice
;
and
yet
I
must
say
that
I
never
saw
,
or
do
I
believe
there
*NL*
was
to
be
seen
,
the
least
indecency
in
the
house
the
whole
time
I
was
*NL*
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
a
man
was
ever
seen
to
come
upstairs
,
except
to
visit
the
lying-in
*NL*
ladies
within
their
month
,
nor
then
without
the
old
lady
with
them
,
who
*NL*
made
it
a
piece
of
honour
of
her
management
that
no
man
should
touch
a
*NL*
woman
,
no
,
not
his
own
wife
,
within
the
month
;
nor
would
she
permit
any
*NL*
man
to
lie
in
the
house
upon
any
pretence
whatever
,
no
,
not
though
she
*NL*
was
sure
it
was
with
his
own
wife
;
and
her
general
saying
for
it
was
,
*NL*
that
she
cared
not
how
many
children
were
born
in
her
house
,
but
she
*NL*
would
have
none
got
there
if
she
could
help
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
might
perhaps
be
carried
further
than
was
needful
,
but
it
was
an
*NL*
error
of
the
right
hand
if
it
was
an
error
,
for
by
this
she
kept
up
the
*NL*
reputation
,
such
as
it
was
,
of
her
business
,
and
obtained
this
*NL*
character
,
that
though
she
did
take
care
of
the
women
when
they
were
*NL*
debauched
,
yet
she
was
not
instrumental
to
their
being
debauched
at
*NL*
all
;
and
yet
it
was
a
wicked
trade
she
drove
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
I
was
there
,
and
before
I
was
brought
to
bed
,
I
received
a
letter
*NL*
from
my
trustee
at
the
bank
,
full
of
kind
,
obliging
things
,
and
*NL*
earnestly
pressing
me
to
return
to
London
.
It
was
near
a
fortnight
old
*NL*
when
it
came
to
me
,
because
it
had
been
first
sent
into
Lancashire
,
and
*NL*
then
returned
to
me
.
He
concludes
with
telling
me
that
he
had
obtained
*NL*
a
decree
,
I
think
he
called
it
,
against
his
wife
,
and
that
he
would
be
*NL*
ready
to
make
good
his
engagement
to
me
,
if
I
would
accept
of
him
,
*NL*
adding
a
great
many
protestations
of
kindness
and
affection
,
such
as
he
*NL*
would
have
been
far
from
offering
if
he
had
known
the
circumstances
I
*NL*
had
been
in
,
and
which
as
it
was
I
had
been
very
far
from
deserving
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
returned
an
answer
to
his
letter
,
and
dated
it
at
Liverpool
,
but
sent
*NL*
it
by
messenger
,
alleging
that
it
came
in
cover
to
a
friend
in
town
.
I
*NL*
gave
him
joy
of
his
deliverance
,
but
raised
some
scruples
at
the
*NL*
lawfulness
of
his
marrying
again
,
and
told
him
I
supposed
he
would
*NL*
consider
very
seriously
upon
that
point
before
he
resolved
on
it
,
the
*NL*
consequence
being
too
great
for
a
man
of
his
judgment
to
venture
rashly
*NL*
upon
a
thing
of
that
nature
;
so
concluded
,
wishing
him
very
well
in
*NL*
whatever
he
resolved
,
without
letting
him
into
anything
of
my
own
mind
,
*NL*
or
giving
any
answer
to
his
proposal
of
my
coming
to
London
to
him
,
but
*NL*
mentioned
at
a
distance
my
intention
to
return
the
latter
end
of
the
*NL*
year
,
this
being
dated
in
April
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
brought
to
bed
about
the
middle
of
May
and
had
another
brave
boy
,
*NL*
and
myself
in
as
good
condition
as
usual
on
such
occasions
.
My
*NL*
governess
did
her
part
as
a
midwife
with
the
greatest
art
and
dexterity
*NL*
imaginable
,
and
far
beyond
all
that
ever
I
had
had
any
experience
of
*NL*
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
care
of
me
in
my
travail
,
and
after
in
my
lying
in
,
was
such
,
that
*NL*
if
she
had
been
my
own
mother
it
could
not
have
been
better
.
Let
none
*NL*
be
encouraged
in
their
loose
practices
from
this
dexterous
lady
's
*NL*
management
,
for
she
is
gone
to
her
place
,
and
I
dare
say
has
left
*NL*
nothing
behind
her
that
can
or
will
come
up
on
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
think
I
had
been
brought
to
bed
about
twenty-two
days
when
I
received
*NL*
another
letter
from
my
friend
at
the
bank
,
with
the
surprising
news
*NL*
that
he
had
obtained
a
final
sentence
of
divorce
against
his
wife
,
and
*NL*
had
served
her
with
it
on
such
a
day
,
and
that
he
had
such
an
answer
to
*NL*
give
to
all
my
scruples
about
his
marrying
again
,
as
I
could
not
*NL*
expect
,
and
as
he
had
no
desire
of
;
for
that
his
wife
,
who
had
been
*NL*
under
some
remorse
before
for
her
usage
of
him
,
as
soon
as
she
had
the
*NL*
account
that
he
had
gained
his
point
,
had
very
unhappily
destroyed
*NL*
herself
that
same
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
expressed
himself
very
handsomely
as
to
his
being
concerned
at
her
*NL*
disaster
,
but
cleared
himself
of
having
any
hand
in
it
,
and
that
he
had
*NL*
only
done
himself
justice
in
a
case
in
which
he
was
notoriously
injured
*NL*
and
abused
.
However
,
he
said
that
he
was
extremely
afflicted
at
it
,
*NL*
and
had
no
view
of
any
satisfaction
left
in
his
world
,
but
only
in
the
*NL*
hope
that
I
would
come
and
relieve
him
by
my
company
;
and
then
he
*NL*
pressed
me
violently
indeed
to
give
him
some
hopes
that
I
would
at
*NL*
least
come
up
to
town
and
let
him
see
me
,
when
he
would
further
enter
*NL*
into
discourse
about
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
exceedingly
surprised
at
the
news
,
and
began
now
seriously
to
*NL*
reflect
on
my
present
circumstances
,
and
the
inexpressible
misfortune
*NL*
it
was
to
me
to
have
a
child
upon
my
hands
,
and
what
to
do
in
it
I
knew
*NL*
not
.
At
last
I
opened
my
case
at
a
distance
to
my
governess
.
I
*NL*
appeared
melancholy
and
uneasy
for
several
days
,
and
she
lay
at
me
*NL*
continually
to
know
what
trouble
me
.
I
could
not
for
my
life
tell
her
*NL*
that
I
had
an
offer
of
marriage
,
after
I
had
so
often
told
her
that
I
*NL*
had
a
husband
,
so
that
I
really
knew
not
what
to
say
to
her
.
I
owned
I
*NL*
had
something
which
very
much
troubled
me
,
but
at
the
same
time
told
*NL*
her
I
could
not
speak
of
it
to
any
one
alive
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
continued
importuning
me
several
days
,
but
it
was
impossible
,
I
*NL*
told
her
,
for
me
to
commit
the
secret
to
anybody
.
This
,
instead
of
*NL*
being
an
answer
to
her
,
increased
her
importunities
;
she
urged
her
*NL*
having
been
trusted
with
the
greatest
secrets
of
this
nature
,
that
it
*NL*
was
her
business
to
conceal
everything
,
and
that
to
discover
things
of
*NL*
that
nature
would
be
her
ruin
.
She
asked
me
if
ever
I
had
found
her
*NL*
tattling
to
me
of
other
people
's
affairs
,
and
how
could
I
suspect
her
?
*NL*
She
told
me
,
to
unfold
myself
to
her
was
telling
it
to
nobody
;
that
she
*NL*
was
silent
as
death
;
that
it
must
be
a
very
strange
case
indeed
that
*NL*
she
could
not
help
me
out
of
;
but
to
conceal
it
was
to
deprive
myself
*NL*
of
all
possible
help
,
or
means
of
help
,
and
to
deprive
her
of
the
*NL*
opportunity
of
serving
me
.
In
short
,
she
had
such
a
bewitching
*NL*
eloquence
,
and
so
great
a
power
of
persuasion
that
there
was
no
*NL*
concealing
anything
from
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
I
resolved
to
unbosom
myself
to
her
.
I
told
her
the
history
of
my
*NL*
Lancashire
marriage
,
and
how
both
of
us
had
been
disappointed
;
how
we
*NL*
came
together
,
and
how
we
parted
;
how
he
absolutely
discharged
me
,
as
*NL*
far
as
lay
in
him
,
free
liberty
to
marry
again
,
protesting
that
if
he
*NL*
knew
it
he
would
never
claim
me
,
or
disturb
or
expose
me
;
that
I
*NL*
thought
I
was
free
,
but
was
dreadfully
afraid
to
venture
,
for
fear
of
*NL*
the
consequences
that
might
follow
in
case
of
a
discovery
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
I
told
her
what
a
good
offer
I
had
;
showed
her
my
friend
's
two
*NL*
last
letters
,
inviting
me
to
come
to
London
,
and
let
her
see
with
what
*NL*
affection
and
earnestness
they
were
written
,
but
blotted
out
the
name
,
*NL*
and
also
the
story
about
the
disaster
of
his
wife
,
only
that
she
was
*NL*
dead
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
fell
a-laughing
at
my
scruples
about
marrying
,
and
told
me
the
*NL*
other
was
no
marriage
,
but
a
cheat
on
both
sides
;
and
that
,
as
we
were
*NL*
parted
by
mutual
consent
,
the
nature
of
the
contract
was
destroyed
,
and
*NL*
the
obligation
was
mutually
discharged
.
She
had
arguments
for
this
at
*NL*
the
tip
of
her
tongue
;
and
,
in
short
,
reasoned
me
out
of
my
reason
;
not
*NL*
but
that
it
was
too
by
the
help
of
my
own
inclination
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
then
came
the
great
and
main
difficulty
,
and
that
was
the
child
;
*NL*
this
,
she
told
me
in
so
many
words
,
must
be
removed
,
and
that
so
as
*NL*
that
it
should
never
be
possible
for
any
one
to
discover
it
.
I
knew
*NL*
there
was
no
marrying
without
entirely
concealing
that
I
had
had
a
*NL*
child
,
for
he
would
soon
have
discovered
by
the
age
of
it
that
it
was
*NL*
born
,
nay
,
and
gotten
too
,
since
my
parley
with
him
,
and
that
would
*NL*
have
destroyed
all
the
affair
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
touched
my
heart
so
forcibly
to
think
of
parting
entirely
with
*NL*
the
child
,
and
,
for
aught
I
knew
,
of
having
it
murdered
,
or
starved
by
*NL*
neglect
and
ill-usage
-LRB-
which
was
much
the
same
-RRB-
,
that
I
could
not
think
*NL*
of
it
without
horror
.
I
wish
all
those
women
who
consent
to
the
*NL*
disposing
their
children
out
of
the
way
,
as
it
is
called
,
for
decency
*NL*
sake
,
would
consider
that
't
is
only
a
contrived
method
for
murder
;
that
*NL*
is
to
say
,
a-killing
their
children
with
safety
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
manifest
to
all
that
understand
anything
of
children
,
that
we
are
*NL*
born
into
the
world
helpless
,
and
incapable
either
to
supply
our
own
*NL*
wants
or
so
much
as
make
them
known
;
and
that
without
help
we
must
*NL*
perish
;
and
this
help
requires
not
only
an
assisting
hand
,
whether
of
*NL*
the
mother
or
somebody
else
,
but
there
are
two
things
necessary
in
that
*NL*
assisting
hand
,
that
is
,
care
and
skill
;
without
both
which
,
half
the
*NL*
children
that
are
born
would
die
,
nay
,
though
they
were
not
to
be
*NL*
denied
food
;
and
one
half
more
of
those
that
remained
would
be
cripples
*NL*
or
fools
,
lose
their
limbs
,
and
perhaps
their
sense
.
I
question
not
*NL*
but
that
these
are
partly
the
reasons
why
affection
was
placed
by
*NL*
nature
in
the
hearts
of
mothers
to
their
children
;
without
which
they
*NL*
would
never
be
able
to
give
themselves
up
,
as
't
is
necessary
they
*NL*
should
,
to
the
care
and
waking
pains
needful
to
the
support
of
their
*NL*
children
.
*NL*
*NL*
Since
this
care
is
needful
to
the
life
of
children
,
to
neglect
them
is
*NL*
to
murder
them
;
again
,
to
give
them
up
to
be
managed
by
those
people
*NL*
who
have
none
of
that
needful
affection
placed
by
nature
in
them
,
is
to
*NL*
neglect
them
in
the
highest
degree
;
nay
,
in
some
it
goes
farther
,
and
*NL*
is
a
neglect
in
order
to
their
being
lost
;
so
that
't
is
even
an
*NL*
intentional
murder
,
whether
the
child
lives
or
dies
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
those
things
represented
themselves
to
my
view
,
and
that
is
the
*NL*
blackest
and
most
frightful
form
:
and
as
I
was
very
free
with
my
*NL*
governess
,
whom
I
had
now
learned
to
call
mother
,
I
represented
to
her
*NL*
all
the
dark
thoughts
which
I
had
upon
me
about
it
,
and
told
her
what
*NL*
distress
I
was
in
.
She
seemed
graver
by
much
at
this
part
than
at
the
*NL*
other
;
but
as
she
was
hardened
in
these
things
beyond
all
possibility
*NL*
of
being
touched
with
the
religious
part
,
and
the
scruples
about
the
*NL*
murder
,
so
she
was
equally
impenetrable
in
that
part
which
related
to
*NL*
affection
.
She
asked
me
if
she
had
not
been
careful
and
tender
to
me
*NL*
in
my
lying
in
,
as
if
I
had
been
her
own
child
.
I
told
her
I
owned
she
*NL*
had
.
`
Well
,
my
dear
,
'
says
she
,
`
and
when
you
are
gone
,
what
are
you
*NL*
to
me
?
And
what
would
it
be
to
me
if
you
were
to
be
hanged
?
Do
you
*NL*
think
there
are
not
women
who
,
as
it
is
their
trade
and
they
get
their
*NL*
bread
by
it
,
value
themselves
upon
their
being
as
careful
of
children
*NL*
as
their
own
mothers
can
be
,
and
understand
it
rather
better
?
Yes
,
*NL*
yes
,
child
,
'
says
she
,
`
fear
it
not
;
how
were
we
nursed
ourselves
?
Are
*NL*
you
sure
you
was
nursed
up
by
your
own
mother
?
and
yet
you
look
fat
and
*NL*
fair
,
child
,
'
says
the
old
beldam
;
and
with
that
she
stroked
me
over
*NL*
the
face
.
`
Never
be
concerned
,
child
,
'
says
she
,
going
on
in
her
*NL*
drolling
way
;
'
I
have
no
murderers
about
me
;
I
employ
the
best
and
the
*NL*
honestest
nurses
that
can
be
had
,
and
have
as
few
children
miscarry
*NL*
under
their
hands
as
there
would
if
they
were
all
nursed
by
mothers
;
we
*NL*
want
neither
care
nor
skill
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
touched
me
to
the
quick
when
she
asked
if
I
was
sure
that
I
was
*NL*
nursed
by
my
own
mother
;
on
the
contrary
I
was
sure
I
was
not
;
and
I
*NL*
trembled
,
and
looked
pale
at
the
very
expression
.
`
Sure
,
'
said
I
to
*NL*
myself
,
`
this
creature
can
not
be
a
witch
,
or
have
any
conversation
with
*NL*
a
spirit
,
that
can
inform
her
what
was
done
with
me
before
I
was
able
*NL*
to
know
it
myself
'
;
and
I
looked
at
her
as
if
I
had
been
frightened
;
*NL*
but
reflecting
that
it
could
not
be
possible
for
her
to
know
anything
*NL*
about
me
,
that
disorder
went
off
,
and
I
began
to
be
easy
,
but
it
was
*NL*
not
presently
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
perceived
the
disorder
I
was
in
,
but
did
not
know
the
meaning
of
*NL*
it
;
so
she
ran
on
in
her
wild
talk
upon
the
weakness
of
my
supposing
*NL*
that
children
were
murdered
because
they
were
not
all
nursed
by
the
*NL*
mother
,
and
to
persuade
me
that
the
children
she
disposed
of
were
as
*NL*
well
used
as
if
the
mothers
had
the
nursing
of
them
themselves
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
may
be
true
,
mother
,
'
says
I
,
`
for
aught
I
know
,
but
my
doubts
are
*NL*
very
strongly
grounded
indeed
.
'
`
Come
,
then
,
'
says
she
,
`
let
's
hear
*NL*
some
of
them
.
'
`
Why
,
first
,
'
says
I
,
`
you
give
a
piece
of
money
to
*NL*
these
people
to
take
the
child
off
the
parent
's
hands
,
and
to
take
care
*NL*
of
it
as
long
as
it
lives
.
Now
we
know
,
mother
,
'
said
I
,
`
that
those
*NL*
are
poor
people
,
and
their
gain
consists
in
being
quit
of
the
charge
as
*NL*
soon
as
they
can
;
how
can
I
doubt
but
that
,
as
it
is
best
for
them
to
*NL*
have
the
child
die
,
they
are
not
over
solicitous
about
life
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
This
is
all
vapours
and
fancy
,
'
says
the
old
woman
;
'
I
tell
you
their
*NL*
credit
depends
upon
the
child
's
life
,
and
they
are
as
careful
as
any
*NL*
mother
of
you
all
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
O
mother
,
'
says
I
,
`
if
I
was
but
sure
my
little
baby
would
be
*NL*
carefully
looked
to
,
and
have
justice
done
it
,
I
should
be
happy
*NL*
indeed
;
but
it
is
impossible
I
can
be
satisfied
in
that
point
unless
I
*NL*
saw
it
,
and
to
see
it
would
be
ruin
and
destruction
to
me
,
as
now
my
*NL*
case
stands
;
so
what
to
do
I
know
not
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
A
fine
story
!
'
says
the
governess
.
`
You
would
see
the
child
,
and
you
*NL*
would
not
see
the
child
;
you
would
be
concealed
and
discovered
both
*NL*
together
.
These
are
things
impossible
,
my
dear
;
so
you
must
e
`
en
do
as
*NL*
other
conscientious
mothers
have
done
before
you
,
and
be
contented
with
*NL*
things
as
they
must
be
,
though
they
are
not
as
you
wish
them
to
be
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
understood
what
she
meant
by
conscientious
mothers
;
she
would
have
*NL*
said
conscientious
whores
,
but
she
was
not
willing
to
disoblige
me
,
for
*NL*
really
in
this
case
I
was
not
a
whore
,
because
legally
married
,
the
*NL*
force
of
former
marriage
excepted
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
let
me
be
what
I
would
,
I
was
not
come
up
to
that
pitch
of
*NL*
hardness
common
to
the
profession
;
I
mean
,
to
be
unnatural
,
and
*NL*
regardless
of
the
safety
of
my
child
;
and
I
preserved
this
honest
*NL*
affection
so
long
,
that
I
was
upon
the
point
of
giving
up
my
friend
at
*NL*
the
bank
,
who
lay
so
hard
at
me
to
come
to
him
and
marry
him
,
that
,
in
*NL*
short
,
there
was
hardly
any
room
to
deny
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
my
old
governess
came
to
me
,
with
her
usual
assurance
.
`
Come
,
*NL*
my
dear
,
'
says
she
,
'
I
have
found
out
a
way
how
you
shall
be
at
a
*NL*
certainty
that
your
child
shall
be
used
well
,
and
yet
the
people
that
*NL*
take
care
of
it
shall
never
know
you
,
or
who
the
mother
of
the
child
*NL*
is
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
mother
,
'
says
I
,
`
if
you
can
do
so
,
you
will
engage
me
to
you
for
*NL*
ever
.
'
`
Well
,
'
says
she
,
`
are
you
willing
to
be
a
some
small
annual
*NL*
expense
,
more
than
what
we
usually
give
to
the
people
we
contract
*NL*
with
?
'
`
Ay
,
'
says
I
,
`
with
all
my
heart
,
provided
I
may
be
concealed
.
'
*NL*
`
As
to
that
,
'
says
the
governess
,
`
you
shall
be
secure
,
for
the
nurse
*NL*
shall
never
so
much
as
dare
to
inquire
about
you
,
and
you
shall
once
or
*NL*
twice
a
year
go
with
me
and
see
your
child
,
and
see
how
't
is
used
,
and
*NL*
be
satisfied
that
it
is
in
good
hands
,
nobody
knowing
who
you
are
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
'
said
I
,
`
do
you
think
,
mother
,
that
when
I
come
to
see
my
child
,
*NL*
I
shall
be
able
to
conceal
my
being
the
mother
of
it
?
Do
you
think
*NL*
that
possible
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
well
,
'
says
my
governess
,
`
if
you
discover
it
,
the
nurse
shall
*NL*
be
never
the
wiser
;
for
she
shall
be
forbid
to
ask
any
questions
about
*NL*
you
,
or
to
take
any
notice
.
If
she
offers
it
,
she
shall
lose
the
money
*NL*
which
you
are
suppose
to
give
her
,
and
the
child
shall
be
taken
from
*NL*
her
too
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
very
well
pleased
with
this
.
So
the
next
week
a
countrywoman
was
*NL*
brought
from
Hertford
,
or
thereabouts
,
who
was
to
take
the
child
off
*NL*
our
hands
entirely
for
#
10
in
money
.
But
if
I
would
allow
#
5
a
year
*NL*
more
of
her
,
she
would
be
obliged
to
bring
the
child
to
my
governess
's
*NL*
house
as
often
as
we
desired
,
or
we
should
come
down
and
look
at
it
,
*NL*
and
see
how
well
she
used
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
woman
was
very
wholesome-looking
,
a
likely
woman
,
a
cottager
's
*NL*
wife
,
but
she
had
very
good
clothes
and
linen
,
and
everything
well
*NL*
about
her
;
and
with
a
heavy
heart
and
many
a
tear
,
I
let
her
have
my
*NL*
child
.
I
had
been
down
at
Hertford
,
and
looked
at
her
and
at
her
*NL*
dwelling
,
which
I
liked
well
enough
;
and
I
promised
her
great
things
if
*NL*
she
would
be
kind
to
the
child
,
so
she
knew
at
first
word
that
I
was
*NL*
the
child
's
mother
.
But
she
seemed
to
be
so
much
out
of
the
way
,
and
*NL*
to
have
no
room
to
inquire
after
me
,
that
I
thought
I
was
safe
enough
.
*NL*
So
,
in
short
,
I
consented
to
let
her
have
the
child
,
and
I
gave
her
*NL*
#
10
;
that
is
to
say
,
I
gave
it
to
my
governess
,
who
gave
it
the
poor
*NL*
woman
before
my
face
,
she
agreeing
never
to
return
the
child
back
to
*NL*
me
,
or
to
claim
anything
more
for
its
keeping
or
bringing
up
;
only
that
*NL*
I
promised
,
if
she
took
a
great
deal
of
care
of
it
,
I
would
give
her
*NL*
something
more
as
often
as
I
came
to
see
it
;
so
that
I
was
not
bound
to
*NL*
pay
the
#
5
,
only
that
I
promised
my
governess
I
would
do
it
.
And
thus
*NL*
my
great
care
was
over
,
after
a
manner
,
which
though
it
did
not
at
all
*NL*
satisfy
my
mind
,
yet
was
the
most
convenient
for
me
,
as
my
affairs
then
*NL*
stood
,
of
any
that
could
be
thought
of
at
that
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
then
began
to
write
to
my
friend
at
the
bank
in
a
more
kindly
style
,
*NL*
and
particularly
about
the
beginning
of
July
I
sent
him
a
letter
,
that
*NL*
I
proposed
to
be
in
town
some
time
in
August
.
He
returned
me
an
answer
*NL*
in
the
most
passionate
terms
imaginable
,
and
desired
me
to
let
him
have
*NL*
timely
notice
,
and
he
would
come
and
meet
me
,
two
day
's
journey
.
This
*NL*
puzzled
me
scurvily
,
and
I
did
not
know
what
answer
to
make
of
it
.
*NL*
Once
I
resolved
to
take
the
stage-coach
to
West
Chester
,
on
purpose
*NL*
only
to
have
the
satisfaction
of
coming
back
,
that
he
might
see
me
*NL*
really
come
in
the
same
coach
;
for
I
had
a
jealous
thought
,
though
I
*NL*
had
no
ground
for
it
at
all
,
lest
he
should
think
I
was
not
really
in
*NL*
the
country
.
And
it
was
no
ill-grounded
thought
as
you
shall
hear
*NL*
presently
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
endeavoured
to
reason
myself
out
of
it
,
but
it
was
in
vain
;
the
*NL*
impression
lay
so
strong
on
my
mind
,
that
it
was
not
to
be
resisted
.
*NL*
At
last
it
came
as
an
addition
to
my
new
design
of
going
into
the
*NL*
country
,
that
it
would
be
an
excellent
blind
to
my
old
governess
,
and
*NL*
would
cover
entirely
all
my
other
affairs
,
for
she
did
not
know
in
the
*NL*
least
whether
my
new
lover
lived
in
London
or
in
Lancashire
;
and
when
I
*NL*
told
her
my
resolution
,
she
was
fully
persuaded
it
was
in
Lancashire
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
taken
my
measure
for
this
journey
I
let
her
know
it
,
and
sent
*NL*
the
maid
that
tended
me
,
from
the
beginning
,
to
take
a
place
for
me
in
*NL*
the
coach
.
She
would
have
had
me
let
the
maid
have
waited
on
me
down
*NL*
to
the
last
stage
,
and
come
up
again
in
the
waggon
,
but
I
convinced
her
*NL*
it
would
not
be
convenient
.
When
I
went
away
,
she
told
me
she
would
*NL*
enter
into
no
measures
for
correspondence
,
for
she
saw
evidently
that
*NL*
my
affection
to
my
child
would
cause
me
to
write
to
her
,
and
to
visit
*NL*
her
too
when
I
came
to
town
again
.
I
assured
her
it
would
,
and
so
took
*NL*
my
leave
,
well
satisfied
to
have
been
freed
from
such
a
house
,
however
*NL*
good
my
accommodations
there
had
been
,
as
I
have
related
above
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
took
the
place
in
the
coach
not
to
its
full
extent
,
but
to
a
place
*NL*
called
Stone
,
in
Cheshire
,
I
think
it
is
,
where
I
not
only
had
no
*NL*
manner
of
business
,
but
not
so
much
as
the
least
acquaintance
with
any
*NL*
person
in
the
town
or
near
it
.
But
I
knew
that
with
money
in
the
*NL*
pocket
one
is
at
home
anywhere
;
so
I
lodged
there
two
or
three
days
,
*NL*
till
,
watching
my
opportunity
,
I
found
room
in
another
stage-coach
,
and
*NL*
took
passage
back
again
for
London
,
sending
a
letter
to
my
gentleman
*NL*
that
I
should
be
such
a
certain
day
at
Stony-Stratford
,
where
the
*NL*
coachman
told
me
he
was
to
lodge
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
happened
to
be
a
chance
coach
that
I
had
taken
up
,
which
,
having
*NL*
been
hired
on
purpose
to
carry
some
gentlemen
to
West
Chester
who
were
*NL*
going
for
Ireland
,
was
now
returning
,
and
did
not
tie
itself
to
exact
*NL*
times
or
places
as
the
stages
did
;
so
that
,
having
been
obliged
to
lie
*NL*
still
on
Sunday
,
he
had
time
to
get
himself
ready
to
come
out
,
which
*NL*
otherwise
he
could
not
have
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
his
warning
was
so
short
,
that
he
could
not
reach
to
*NL*
Stony-Stratford
time
enough
to
be
with
me
at
night
,
but
he
met
me
at
a
*NL*
place
called
Brickhill
the
next
morning
,
as
we
were
just
coming
in
to
*NL*
tow
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
confess
I
was
very
glad
to
see
him
,
for
I
had
thought
myself
a
little
*NL*
disappointed
over-night
,
seeing
I
had
gone
so
far
to
contrive
my
coming
*NL*
on
purpose
.
He
pleased
me
doubly
too
by
the
figure
he
came
in
,
for
he
*NL*
brought
a
very
handsome
-LRB-
gentleman
's
-RRB-
coach
and
four
horses
,
with
a
*NL*
servant
to
attend
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
me
out
of
the
stage-coach
immediately
,
which
stopped
at
an
inn
*NL*
in
Brickhill
;
and
putting
into
the
same
inn
,
he
set
up
his
own
coach
,
*NL*
and
bespoke
his
dinner
.
I
asked
him
what
he
meant
by
that
,
for
I
was
*NL*
for
going
forward
with
the
journey
.
He
said
,
No
,
I
had
need
of
a
*NL*
little
rest
upon
the
road
,
and
that
was
a
very
good
sort
of
a
house
,
*NL*
though
it
was
but
a
little
town
;
so
we
would
go
no
farther
that
night
,
*NL*
whatever
came
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
did
not
press
him
much
,
for
since
he
had
come
so
to
meet
me
,
and
put
*NL*
himself
to
so
much
expense
,
it
was
but
reasonable
I
should
oblige
him
a
*NL*
little
too
;
so
I
was
easy
as
to
that
point
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
dinner
we
walked
to
see
the
town
,
to
see
the
church
,
and
to
view
*NL*
the
fields
,
and
the
country
,
as
is
usual
for
strangers
to
do
;
and
our
*NL*
landlord
was
our
guide
in
going
to
see
the
church
.
I
observed
my
*NL*
gentleman
inquired
pretty
much
about
the
parson
,
and
I
took
the
hint
*NL*
immediately
that
he
certainly
would
propose
to
be
married
;
and
though
*NL*
it
was
a
sudden
thought
,
it
followed
presently
,
that
,
in
short
,
I
would
*NL*
not
refuse
him
;
for
,
to
be
plain
,
with
my
circumstances
I
was
in
no
*NL*
condition
now
to
say
No
;
I
had
no
reason
now
to
run
any
more
such
*NL*
hazards
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
while
these
thoughts
ran
round
in
my
head
,
which
was
the
work
but
*NL*
of
a
few
moments
,
I
observed
my
landlord
took
him
aside
and
whispered
*NL*
to
him
,
though
not
very
softly
neither
,
for
so
much
I
overheard
:
`
Sir
,
*NL*
if
you
shall
have
occasion
--
'
the
rest
I
could
not
hear
,
but
it
seems
*NL*
it
was
to
this
purpose
:
`
Sir
,
if
you
shall
have
occasion
for
a
*NL*
minister
,
I
have
a
friend
a
little
way
off
that
will
serve
you
,
and
be
*NL*
as
private
as
you
please
.
'
My
gentleman
answered
loud
enough
for
me
to
*NL*
hear
,
`
Very
well
,
I
believe
I
shall
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
no
sooner
come
back
to
the
inn
but
he
fell
upon
me
with
*NL*
irresistible
words
,
that
since
he
had
had
the
good
fortune
to
meet
me
,
*NL*
and
everything
concurred
,
it
would
be
hastening
his
felicity
if
I
would
*NL*
put
an
end
to
the
matter
just
there
.
`
What
do
you
mean
?
'
says
I
,
*NL*
colouring
a
little
.
`
What
,
in
an
inn
,
and
upon
the
road
!
Bless
us
*NL*
all
,
'
said
I
,
as
if
I
had
been
surprised
,
`
how
can
you
talk
so
?
'
`
Oh
,
*NL*
I
can
talk
so
very
well
,
'
says
he
,
'
I
came
a-purpose
to
talk
so
,
and
*NL*
I
'll
show
you
that
I
did
'
;
and
with
that
he
pulls
out
a
great
bundle
of
*NL*
papers
.
`
You
fright
me
,
'
said
I
;
`
what
are
all
these
?
'
`
Do
n't
be
*NL*
frighted
,
my
dear
,
'
said
he
,
and
kissed
me
.
This
was
the
first
time
*NL*
that
he
had
been
so
free
to
call
me
`
my
dear
'
;
then
he
repeated
it
,
*NL*
`
Do
n't
be
frighted
;
you
shall
see
what
it
is
all
'
;
then
he
laid
them
*NL*
all
abroad
.
There
was
first
the
deed
or
sentence
of
divorce
from
his
*NL*
wife
,
and
the
full
evidence
of
her
playing
the
whore
;
then
there
were
*NL*
the
certificates
of
the
minister
and
churchwardens
of
the
parish
where
*NL*
she
lived
,
proving
that
she
was
buried
,
and
intimating
the
manner
of
*NL*
her
death
;
the
copy
of
the
coroner
's
warrant
for
a
jury
to
sit
upon
*NL*
her
,
and
the
verdict
of
the
jury
,
who
brought
it
in
Non
compos
mentis
.
*NL*
All
this
was
indeed
to
the
purpose
,
and
to
give
me
satisfaction
,
*NL*
though
,
by
the
way
,
I
was
not
so
scrupulous
,
had
he
known
all
,
but
that
*NL*
I
might
have
taken
him
without
it
.
However
,
I
looked
them
all
over
as
*NL*
well
as
I
could
,
and
told
him
that
this
was
all
very
clear
indeed
,
but
*NL*
that
he
need
not
have
given
himself
the
trouble
to
have
brought
them
*NL*
out
with
him
,
for
it
was
time
enough
.
Well
,
he
said
,
it
might
be
time
*NL*
enough
for
me
,
but
no
time
but
the
present
time
was
time
enough
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
other
papers
rolled
up
,
and
I
asked
him
what
they
were
.
*NL*
`
Why
,
ay
,
'
says
he
,
`
that
's
the
question
I
wanted
to
have
you
ask
me
'
;
*NL*
so
he
unrolls
them
and
takes
out
a
little
shagreen
case
,
and
gives
me
*NL*
out
of
it
a
very
fine
diamond
ring
.
I
could
not
refuse
it
,
if
I
had
a
*NL*
mind
to
do
so
,
for
he
put
it
upon
my
finger
;
so
I
made
him
a
curtsy
and
*NL*
accepted
it
.
Then
he
takes
out
another
ring
:
`
And
this
,
'
says
he
,
`
is
*NL*
for
another
occasion
,
'
so
he
puts
that
in
his
pocket
.
`
Well
,
but
let
*NL*
me
see
it
,
though
,
'
says
I
,
and
smiled
;
'
I
guess
what
it
is
;
I
think
*NL*
you
are
mad
.
'
'
I
should
have
been
mad
if
I
had
done
less
,
'
says
he
,
and
*NL*
still
he
did
not
show
me
,
and
I
had
a
great
mind
to
see
it
;
so
I
says
,
*NL*
`
Well
,
but
let
me
see
it
.
'
`
Hold
,
'
says
he
,
`
first
look
here
'
;
then
he
*NL*
took
up
the
roll
again
and
read
it
,
and
behold
!
it
was
a
licence
for
us
*NL*
to
be
married
.
`
Why
,
'
says
I
,
`
are
you
distracted
?
Why
,
you
were
*NL*
fully
satisfied
that
I
would
comply
and
yield
at
first
word
,
or
*NL*
resolved
to
take
no
denial
.
'
`
The
last
is
certainly
the
case
,
'
said
*NL*
he
.
`
But
you
may
be
mistaken
,
'
said
I.
`
No
,
no
,
'
says
he
,
`
how
can
*NL*
you
think
so
?
I
must
not
be
denied
,
I
ca
n't
be
denied
'
;
and
with
that
*NL*
he
fell
to
kissing
me
so
violently
,
I
could
not
get
rid
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
bed
in
the
room
,
and
we
were
walking
to
and
again
,
eager
in
*NL*
the
discourse
;
at
last
he
takes
me
by
surprise
in
his
arms
,
and
threw
*NL*
me
on
the
bed
and
himself
with
me
,
and
holding
me
fast
in
his
arms
,
but
*NL*
without
the
least
offer
of
any
indecency
,
courted
me
to
consent
with
*NL*
such
repeated
entreaties
and
arguments
,
protesting
his
affection
,
and
*NL*
vowing
he
would
not
let
me
go
till
I
had
promised
him
,
that
at
last
I
*NL*
said
,
`
Why
,
you
resolve
not
to
be
denied
,
indeed
,
I
ca
n't
be
denied
.
'
*NL*
`
Well
,
well
,
'
said
I
,
and
giving
him
a
slight
kiss
,
`
then
you
sha
n't
be
*NL*
denied
,
'
said
I
;
`
let
me
get
up
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
so
transported
with
my
consent
,
and
the
kind
manner
of
it
,
that
*NL*
I
began
to
think
once
he
took
it
for
a
marriage
,
and
would
not
stay
for
*NL*
the
form
;
but
I
wronged
him
,
for
he
gave
over
kissing
me
,
and
then
*NL*
giving
me
two
or
three
kisses
again
,
thanked
me
for
my
kind
yielding
to
*NL*
him
;
and
was
so
overcome
with
the
satisfaction
and
joy
of
it
,
that
I
*NL*
saw
tears
stand
in
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
turned
from
him
,
for
it
filled
my
eyes
with
tears
too
,
and
I
asked
*NL*
him
leave
to
retire
a
little
to
my
chamber
.
If
ever
I
had
a
grain
of
*NL*
true
repentance
for
a
vicious
and
abominable
life
for
twenty-four
years
*NL*
past
,
it
was
then
.
On
,
what
a
felicity
is
it
to
mankind
,
said
I
to
*NL*
myself
,
that
they
can
not
see
into
the
hearts
of
one
another
!
How
happy
*NL*
had
it
been
for
me
if
I
had
been
wife
to
a
man
of
so
much
honesty
,
and
*NL*
so
much
affection
from
the
beginning
!
*NL*
*NL*
Then
it
occurred
to
me
,
`
What
an
abominable
creature
am
I
!
and
how
is
*NL*
this
innocent
gentleman
going
to
be
abused
by
me
!
How
little
does
he
*NL*
think
,
that
having
divorced
a
whore
,
he
is
throwing
himself
into
the
*NL*
arms
of
another
!
that
he
is
going
to
marry
one
that
has
lain
with
two
*NL*
brothers
,
and
has
had
three
children
by
her
own
brother
!
one
that
was
*NL*
born
in
Newgate
,
whose
mother
was
a
whore
,
and
is
now
a
transported
*NL*
thief
!
one
that
has
lain
with
thirteen
men
,
and
has
had
a
child
since
*NL*
he
saw
me
!
Poor
gentleman
!
'
said
I
,
`
what
is
he
going
to
do
?
'
After
*NL*
this
reproaching
myself
was
over
,
it
following
thus
:
`
Well
,
if
I
must
*NL*
be
his
wife
,
if
it
please
God
to
give
me
grace
,
I
'll
be
a
true
wife
to
*NL*
him
,
and
love
him
suitably
to
the
strange
excess
of
his
passion
for
me
;
*NL*
I
will
make
him
amends
if
possible
,
by
what
he
shall
see
,
for
the
*NL*
cheats
and
abuses
I
put
upon
him
,
which
he
does
not
see
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
impatient
for
my
coming
out
of
my
chamber
,
but
finding
me
long
,
*NL*
he
went
downstairs
and
talked
with
my
landlord
about
the
parson
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
landlord
,
an
officious
though
well-meaning
fellow
,
had
sent
away
for
*NL*
the
neighbouring
clergyman
;
and
when
my
gentleman
began
to
speak
of
it
*NL*
to
him
,
and
talk
of
sending
for
him
,
`
Sir
,
'
says
he
to
him
,
`
my
friend
*NL*
is
in
the
house
'
;
so
without
any
more
words
he
brought
them
together
.
*NL*
When
he
came
to
the
minister
,
he
asked
him
if
he
would
venture
to
marry
*NL*
a
couple
of
strangers
that
were
both
willing
.
The
parson
said
that
Mr.
*NL*
--
had
said
something
to
him
of
it
;
that
he
hoped
it
was
no
*NL*
clandestine
business
;
that
he
seemed
to
be
a
grave
gentleman
,
and
he
*NL*
supposed
madam
was
not
a
girl
,
so
that
the
consent
of
friends
should
be
*NL*
wanted
.
`
To
put
you
out
of
doubt
of
that
,
'
says
my
gentleman
,
`
read
*NL*
this
paper
'
;
and
out
he
pulls
the
license
.
'
I
am
satisfied
,
'
says
the
*NL*
minister
;
`
where
is
the
lady
?
'
`
You
shall
see
her
presently
,
'
says
my
*NL*
gentleman
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
had
said
thus
he
comes
upstairs
,
and
I
was
by
that
time
come
*NL*
out
of
my
room
;
so
he
tells
me
the
minister
was
below
,
and
that
he
had
*NL*
talked
with
him
,
and
that
upon
showing
him
the
license
,
he
was
free
to
*NL*
marry
us
with
all
his
heart
,
`
but
he
asks
to
see
you
'
;
so
he
asked
if
I
*NL*
would
let
him
come
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
Tis
time
enough
,
'
said
I
,
`
in
the
morning
,
is
it
not
?
'
`
Why
,
'
said
*NL*
he
,
`
my
dear
,
he
seemed
to
scruple
whether
it
was
not
some
young
girl
*NL*
stolen
from
her
parents
,
and
I
assured
him
we
were
both
of
age
to
*NL*
command
our
own
consent
;
and
that
made
him
ask
to
see
you
.
'
`
Well
,
'
*NL*
said
I
,
`
do
as
you
please
'
;
so
up
they
brings
the
parson
,
and
a
merry
,
*NL*
good
sort
of
gentleman
he
was
.
He
had
been
told
,
it
seems
,
that
we
had
*NL*
met
there
by
accident
,
that
I
came
in
the
Chester
coach
,
and
my
*NL*
gentleman
in
his
own
coach
to
meet
me
;
that
we
were
to
have
met
last
*NL*
night
at
Stony-Stratford
,
but
that
he
could
not
reach
so
far
.
`
Well
,
*NL*
sir
,
'
says
the
parson
,
`
every
ill
turn
has
some
good
in
it
.
The
*NL*
disappointment
,
sir
,
'
says
he
to
my
gentleman
,
`
was
yours
,
and
the
good
*NL*
turn
is
mine
,
for
if
you
had
met
at
Stony-Stratford
I
had
not
had
the
*NL*
honour
to
marry
you
.
Landlord
,
have
you
a
Common
Prayer
Book
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
started
as
if
I
had
been
frightened
.
`
Lord
,
sir
,
'
says
I
,
`
what
do
*NL*
you
mean
?
What
,
to
marry
in
an
inn
,
and
at
night
too
?
'
`
Madam
,
'
says
*NL*
the
minister
,
`
if
you
will
have
it
be
in
the
church
,
you
shall
;
but
I
*NL*
assure
you
your
marriage
will
be
as
firm
here
as
in
the
church
;
we
are
*NL*
not
tied
by
the
canons
to
marry
nowhere
but
in
the
church
;
and
if
you
*NL*
will
have
it
in
the
church
,
it
will
be
a
public
as
a
county
fair
;
and
*NL*
as
for
the
time
of
day
,
it
does
not
at
all
weigh
in
this
case
;
our
*NL*
princes
are
married
in
their
chambers
,
and
at
eight
or
ten
o'clock
at
*NL*
night
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
a
great
while
before
I
could
be
persuaded
,
and
pretended
not
to
*NL*
be
willing
at
all
to
be
married
but
in
the
church
.
But
it
was
all
*NL*
grimace
;
so
I
seemed
at
last
to
be
prevailed
on
,
and
my
landlord
and
*NL*
his
wife
and
daughter
were
called
up
.
My
landlord
was
father
and
clerk
*NL*
and
all
together
,
and
we
were
married
,
and
very
merry
we
were
;
though
I
*NL*
confess
the
self-reproaches
which
I
had
upon
me
before
lay
close
to
me
,
*NL*
and
extorted
every
now
and
then
a
deep
sigh
from
me
,
which
my
*NL*
bridegroom
took
notice
of
,
and
endeavoured
to
encourage
me
,
thinking
,
*NL*
poor
man
,
that
I
had
some
little
hesitations
at
the
step
I
had
taken
so
*NL*
hastily
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
enjoyed
ourselves
that
evening
completely
,
and
yet
all
was
kept
so
*NL*
private
in
the
inn
that
not
a
servant
in
the
house
knew
of
it
,
for
my
*NL*
landlady
and
her
daughter
waited
on
me
,
and
would
not
let
any
of
the
*NL*
maids
come
upstairs
,
except
while
we
were
at
supper
.
My
landlady
's
*NL*
daughter
I
called
my
bridesmaid
;
and
sending
for
a
shopkeeper
the
next
*NL*
morning
,
I
gave
the
young
woman
a
good
suit
of
knots
,
as
good
as
the
*NL*
town
would
afford
,
and
finding
it
was
a
lace-making
town
,
I
gave
her
*NL*
mother
a
piece
of
bone-lace
for
a
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
reason
that
my
landlord
was
so
close
was
,
that
he
was
unwilling
the
*NL*
minister
of
the
parish
should
hear
of
it
;
but
for
all
that
somebody
*NL*
heard
of
it
,
so
at
that
we
had
the
bells
set
a-ringing
the
next
morning
*NL*
early
,
and
the
music
,
such
as
the
town
would
afford
,
under
our
window
;
*NL*
but
my
landlord
brazened
it
out
,
that
we
were
married
before
we
came
*NL*
thither
,
only
that
,
being
his
former
guests
,
we
would
have
our
*NL*
wedding-supper
at
his
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
could
not
find
in
our
hearts
to
stir
the
next
day
;
for
,
in
short
,
*NL*
having
been
disturbed
by
the
bells
in
the
morning
,
and
having
perhaps
*NL*
not
slept
overmuch
before
,
we
were
so
sleepy
afterwards
that
we
lay
in
*NL*
bed
till
almost
twelve
o'clock
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
begged
my
landlady
that
we
might
not
have
any
more
music
in
the
town
,
*NL*
nor
ringing
of
bells
,
and
she
managed
it
so
well
that
we
were
very
*NL*
quiet
;
but
an
odd
passage
interrupted
all
my
mirth
for
a
good
while
.
*NL*
The
great
room
of
the
house
looked
into
the
street
,
and
my
new
spouse
*NL*
being
belowstairs
,
I
had
walked
to
the
end
of
the
room
;
and
it
being
a
*NL*
pleasant
,
warm
day
,
I
had
opened
the
window
,
and
was
standing
at
it
for
*NL*
some
air
,
when
I
saw
three
gentlemen
come
by
on
horseback
and
go
into
*NL*
an
inn
just
against
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
to
be
concealed
,
nor
was
it
so
doubtful
as
to
leave
me
any
*NL*
room
to
question
it
,
but
the
second
of
the
three
was
my
Lancashire
*NL*
husband
.
I
was
frightened
to
death
;
I
never
was
in
such
a
*NL*
consternation
in
my
life
;
I
though
I
should
have
sunk
into
the
ground
;
*NL*
my
blood
ran
chill
in
my
veins
,
and
I
trembled
as
if
I
had
been
in
a
*NL*
cold
fit
of
ague
.
I
say
,
there
was
no
room
to
question
the
truth
of
*NL*
it
;
I
knew
his
clothes
,
I
knew
his
horse
,
and
I
knew
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
sensible
reflect
I
made
was
,
that
my
husband
was
not
by
to
*NL*
see
my
disorder
,
and
that
I
was
very
glad
of
it
.
The
gentlemen
had
not
*NL*
been
long
in
the
house
but
they
came
to
the
window
of
their
room
,
as
is
*NL*
usual
;
but
my
window
was
shut
,
you
may
be
sure
.
However
,
I
could
not
*NL*
keep
from
peeping
at
them
,
and
there
I
saw
him
again
,
heard
him
call
*NL*
out
to
one
of
the
servants
of
the
house
for
something
he
wanted
,
and
*NL*
received
all
the
terrifying
confirmations
of
its
being
the
same
person
*NL*
that
were
possible
to
be
had
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
next
concern
was
to
know
,
if
possible
,
what
was
his
business
there
;
*NL*
but
that
was
impossible
.
Sometimes
my
imagination
formed
an
idea
of
*NL*
one
frightful
thing
,
sometimes
of
another
;
sometime
I
thought
he
had
*NL*
discovered
me
,
and
was
come
to
upbraid
me
with
ingratitude
and
breach
*NL*
of
honour
;
and
every
moment
I
fancied
he
was
coming
up
the
stairs
to
*NL*
insult
me
;
and
innumerable
fancies
came
into
my
head
of
what
was
never
*NL*
in
his
head
,
nor
ever
could
be
,
unless
the
devil
had
revealed
it
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
remained
in
this
fright
nearly
two
hours
,
and
scarce
ever
kept
my
eye
*NL*
from
the
window
or
door
of
the
inn
where
they
were
.
At
last
,
hearing
a
*NL*
great
clatter
in
the
passage
of
their
inn
,
I
ran
to
the
window
,
and
,
to
*NL*
my
great
satisfaction
,
saw
them
all
three
go
out
again
and
travel
on
*NL*
westward
.
Had
they
gone
towards
London
,
I
should
have
been
still
in
a
*NL*
fright
,
lest
I
should
meet
him
on
the
road
again
,
and
that
he
should
*NL*
know
me
;
but
he
went
the
contrary
way
,
and
so
I
was
eased
of
that
*NL*
disorder
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
resolved
to
be
going
the
next
day
,
but
about
six
o'clock
at
night
we
*NL*
were
alarmed
with
a
great
uproar
in
the
street
,
and
people
riding
as
if
*NL*
they
had
been
out
of
their
wits
;
and
what
was
it
but
a
hue-and-cry
*NL*
after
three
highwaymen
that
had
robbed
two
coaches
and
some
other
*NL*
travellers
near
Dunstable
Hill
,
and
notice
had
,
it
seems
,
been
given
*NL*
that
they
had
been
seen
at
Brickhill
at
such
a
house
,
meaning
the
house
*NL*
where
those
gentlemen
had
been
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
house
was
immediately
beset
and
searched
,
but
there
were
witnesses
*NL*
enough
that
the
gentlemen
had
been
gone
over
three
hours
.
The
crowd
*NL*
having
gathered
about
,
we
had
the
news
presently
;
and
I
was
heartily
*NL*
concerned
now
another
way
.
I
presently
told
the
people
of
the
house
,
*NL*
that
I
durst
to
say
those
were
not
the
persons
,
for
that
I
knew
one
of
*NL*
the
gentlemen
to
be
a
very
honest
person
,
and
of
a
good
estate
in
*NL*
Lancashire
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
constable
who
came
with
the
hue-and-cry
was
immediately
informed
of
*NL*
this
,
and
came
over
to
me
to
be
satisfied
from
my
own
mouth
,
and
I
*NL*
assured
him
that
I
saw
the
three
gentlemen
as
I
was
at
the
window
;
that
*NL*
I
saw
them
afterwards
at
the
windows
of
the
room
they
dined
in
;
that
I
*NL*
saw
them
afterwards
take
horse
,
and
I
could
assure
him
I
knew
one
of
*NL*
them
to
be
such
a
man
,
that
he
was
a
gentleman
of
a
very
good
estate
,
*NL*
and
an
undoubted
character
in
Lancashire
,
from
whence
I
was
just
now
*NL*
upon
my
journey
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
assurance
with
which
I
delivered
this
gave
the
mob
gentry
a
check
,
*NL*
and
gave
the
constable
such
satisfaction
,
that
he
immediately
sounded
a
*NL*
retreat
,
told
his
people
these
were
not
the
men
,
but
that
he
had
an
*NL*
account
they
were
very
honest
gentlemen
;
and
so
they
went
all
back
*NL*
again
.
What
the
truth
of
the
matter
was
I
knew
not
,
but
certain
it
was
*NL*
that
the
coaches
were
robbed
at
Dunstable
Hill
,
and
#
560
in
money
*NL*
taken
;
besides
,
some
of
the
lace
merchants
that
always
travel
that
way
*NL*
had
been
visited
too
.
As
to
the
three
gentlemen
,
that
remains
to
be
*NL*
explained
hereafter
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
this
alarm
stopped
us
another
day
,
though
my
spouse
was
for
*NL*
travelling
,
and
told
me
that
it
was
always
safest
travelling
after
a
*NL*
robbery
,
for
that
the
thieves
were
sure
to
be
gone
far
enough
off
when
*NL*
they
had
alarmed
the
country
;
but
I
was
afraid
and
uneasy
,
and
indeed
*NL*
principally
lest
my
old
acquaintance
should
be
upon
the
road
still
,
and
*NL*
should
chance
to
see
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
never
lived
four
pleasanter
days
together
in
my
life
.
I
was
a
mere
*NL*
bride
all
this
while
,
and
my
new
spouse
strove
to
make
me
entirely
easy
*NL*
in
everything
.
Oh
could
this
state
of
life
have
continued
,
how
had
all
*NL*
my
past
troubles
been
forgot
,
and
my
future
sorrows
avoided
!
But
I
had
*NL*
a
past
life
of
a
most
wretched
kind
to
account
for
,
some
if
it
in
this
*NL*
world
as
well
as
in
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
came
away
the
fifth
day
;
and
my
landlord
,
because
he
saw
me
uneasy
,
*NL*
mounted
himself
,
his
son
,
and
three
honest
country
fellows
with
good
*NL*
firearms
,
and
,
without
telling
us
of
it
,
followed
the
coach
,
and
would
*NL*
see
us
safe
into
Dunstable
.
We
could
do
no
less
than
treat
them
very
*NL*
handsomely
at
Dunstable
,
which
cost
my
spouse
about
ten
or
twelve
*NL*
shillings
,
and
something
he
gave
the
men
for
their
time
too
,
but
my
*NL*
landlord
would
take
nothing
for
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
most
happy
contrivance
for
me
that
could
have
fallen
out
;
*NL*
for
had
I
come
to
London
unmarried
,
I
must
either
have
come
to
him
for
*NL*
the
first
night
's
entertainment
,
or
have
discovered
to
him
that
I
had
*NL*
not
one
acquaintance
in
the
whole
city
of
London
that
could
receive
a
*NL*
poor
bride
for
the
first
night
's
lodging
with
her
spouse
.
But
now
,
*NL*
being
an
old
married
woman
,
I
made
no
scruple
of
going
directly
home
*NL*
with
him
,
and
there
I
took
possession
at
once
of
a
house
well
*NL*
furnished
,
and
a
husband
in
very
good
circumstances
,
so
that
I
had
a
*NL*
prospect
of
a
very
happy
life
,
if
I
knew
how
to
manage
it
;
and
I
had
*NL*
leisure
to
consider
of
the
real
value
of
the
life
I
was
likely
to
live
.
*NL*
How
different
it
was
to
be
from
the
loose
ungoverned
part
I
had
acted
*NL*
before
,
and
how
much
happier
a
life
of
virtue
and
sobriety
is
,
than
*NL*
that
which
we
call
a
life
of
pleasure
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oh
had
this
particular
scene
of
life
lasted
,
or
had
I
learned
from
that
*NL*
time
I
enjoyed
it
,
to
have
tasted
the
true
sweetness
of
it
,
and
had
I
*NL*
not
fallen
into
that
poverty
which
is
the
sure
bane
of
virtue
,
how
*NL*
happy
had
I
been
,
not
only
here
,
but
perhaps
for
ever
!
for
while
I
*NL*
lived
thus
,
I
was
really
a
penitent
for
all
my
life
past
.
I
looked
*NL*
back
on
it
with
abhorrence
,
and
might
truly
be
said
to
hate
myself
for
*NL*
it
.
I
often
reflected
how
my
lover
at
the
Bath
,
struck
at
the
hand
of
*NL*
God
,
repented
and
abandoned
me
,
and
refused
to
see
me
any
more
,
though
*NL*
he
loved
me
to
an
extreme
;
but
I
,
prompted
by
that
worst
of
devils
,
*NL*
poverty
,
returned
to
the
vile
practice
,
and
made
the
advantage
of
what
*NL*
they
call
a
handsome
face
to
be
the
relief
to
my
necessities
,
and
*NL*
beauty
be
a
pimp
to
vice
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
I
seemed
landed
in
a
safe
harbour
,
after
the
stormy
voyage
of
life
*NL*
past
was
at
an
end
,
and
I
began
to
be
thankful
for
my
deliverance
.
I
*NL*
sat
many
an
hour
by
myself
,
and
wept
over
the
remembrance
of
past
*NL*
follies
,
and
the
dreadful
extravagances
of
a
wicked
life
,
and
sometimes
*NL*
I
flattered
myself
that
I
had
sincerely
repented
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
there
are
temptations
which
it
is
not
in
the
power
of
human
nature
*NL*
to
resist
,
and
few
know
what
would
be
their
case
if
driven
to
the
same
*NL*
exigencies
.
As
covetousness
is
the
root
of
all
evil
,
so
poverty
is
,
I
*NL*
believe
,
the
worst
of
all
snares
.
But
I
waive
that
discourse
till
I
*NL*
come
to
an
experiment
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
lived
with
this
husband
with
the
utmost
tranquillity
;
he
was
a
quiet
,
*NL*
sensible
,
sober
man
;
virtuous
,
modest
,
sincere
,
and
in
his
business
*NL*
diligent
and
just
.
His
business
was
in
a
narrow
compass
,
and
his
*NL*
income
sufficient
to
a
plentiful
way
of
living
in
the
ordinary
way
.
I
*NL*
do
not
say
to
keep
an
equipage
,
and
make
a
figure
,
as
the
world
calls
*NL*
it
,
nor
did
I
expect
it
,
or
desire
it
;
for
as
I
abhorred
the
levity
and
*NL*
extravagance
of
my
former
life
,
so
I
chose
now
to
live
retired
,
frugal
,
*NL*
and
within
ourselves
.
I
kept
no
company
,
made
no
visits
;
minded
my
*NL*
family
,
and
obliged
my
husband
;
and
this
kind
of
life
became
a
pleasure
*NL*
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
lived
in
an
uninterrupted
course
of
ease
and
content
for
five
years
,
*NL*
when
a
sudden
blow
from
an
almost
invisible
hand
blasted
all
my
*NL*
happiness
,
and
turned
me
out
into
the
world
in
a
condition
the
reverse
*NL*
of
all
that
had
been
before
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
husband
having
trusted
one
of
his
fellow-clerks
with
a
sum
of
money
,
*NL*
too
much
for
our
fortunes
to
bear
the
loss
of
,
the
clerk
failed
,
and
*NL*
the
loss
fell
very
heavy
on
my
husband
,
yet
it
was
not
so
great
neither
*NL*
but
that
,
if
he
had
had
spirit
and
courage
to
have
looked
his
*NL*
misfortunes
in
the
face
,
his
credit
was
so
good
that
,
as
I
told
him
,
he
*NL*
would
easily
recover
it
;
for
to
sink
under
trouble
is
to
double
the
*NL*
weight
,
and
he
that
will
die
in
it
,
shall
die
in
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
in
vain
to
speak
comfortably
to
him
;
the
wound
had
sunk
too
*NL*
deep
;
it
was
a
stab
that
touched
the
vitals
;
he
grew
melancholy
and
*NL*
disconsolate
,
and
from
thence
lethargic
,
and
died
.
I
foresaw
the
blow
,
*NL*
and
was
extremely
oppressed
in
my
mind
,
for
I
saw
evidently
that
if
he
*NL*
died
I
was
undone
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
had
two
children
by
him
and
no
more
,
for
,
to
tell
the
truth
,
it
*NL*
began
to
be
time
for
me
to
leave
bearing
children
,
for
I
was
now
*NL*
eight-and-forty
,
and
I
suppose
if
he
had
lived
I
should
have
had
no
*NL*
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
now
left
in
a
dismal
and
disconsolate
case
indeed
,
and
in
several
*NL*
things
worse
than
ever
.
First
,
it
was
past
the
flourishing
time
with
*NL*
me
when
I
might
expect
to
be
courted
for
a
mistress
;
that
agreeable
*NL*
part
had
declined
some
time
,
and
the
ruins
only
appeared
of
what
had
*NL*
been
;
and
that
which
was
worse
than
all
this
,
that
I
was
the
most
*NL*
dejected
,
disconsolate
creature
alive
.
I
that
had
encouraged
my
*NL*
husband
,
and
endeavoured
to
support
his
spirits
under
his
trouble
,
*NL*
could
not
support
my
own
;
I
wanted
that
spirit
in
trouble
which
I
told
*NL*
him
was
so
necessary
to
him
for
bearing
the
burthen
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
my
case
was
indeed
deplorable
,
for
I
was
left
perfectly
friendless
*NL*
and
helpless
,
and
the
loss
my
husband
had
sustained
had
reduced
his
*NL*
circumstances
so
low
,
that
though
indeed
I
was
not
in
debt
,
yet
I
could
*NL*
easily
foresee
that
what
was
left
would
not
support
me
long
;
that
while
*NL*
it
wasted
daily
for
subsistence
,
I
had
not
way
to
increase
it
one
*NL*
shilling
,
so
that
it
would
be
soon
all
spent
,
and
then
I
saw
nothing
*NL*
before
me
but
the
utmost
distress
;
and
this
represented
itself
so
*NL*
lively
to
my
thoughts
,
that
it
seemed
as
if
it
was
come
,
before
it
was
*NL*
really
very
near
;
also
my
very
apprehensions
doubled
the
misery
,
for
I
*NL*
fancied
every
sixpence
that
I
paid
for
a
loaf
of
bread
was
the
last
*NL*
that
I
had
in
the
world
,
and
that
to-morrow
I
was
to
fast
,
and
be
*NL*
starved
to
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
distress
I
had
no
assistant
,
no
friend
to
comfort
or
advise
me
;
*NL*
I
sat
and
cried
and
tormented
myself
night
and
day
,
wringing
my
hands
,
*NL*
and
sometimes
raving
like
a
distracted
woman
;
and
indeed
I
have
often
*NL*
wondered
it
had
not
affected
my
reason
,
for
I
had
the
vapours
to
such
a
*NL*
degree
,
that
my
understanding
was
sometimes
quite
lost
in
fancies
and
*NL*
imaginations
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
lived
two
years
in
this
dismal
condition
,
wasting
that
little
I
had
,
*NL*
weeping
continually
over
my
dismal
circumstances
,
and
,
as
it
were
,
only
*NL*
bleeding
to
death
,
without
the
least
hope
or
prospect
of
help
from
God
*NL*
or
man
;
and
now
I
had
cried
too
long
,
and
so
often
,
that
tears
were
,
as
*NL*
I
might
say
,
exhausted
,
and
I
began
to
be
desperate
,
for
I
grew
poor
*NL*
apace
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
little
relief
I
had
put
off
my
house
and
took
lodgings
;
and
as
I
*NL*
was
reducing
my
living
,
so
I
sold
off
most
of
my
goods
,
which
put
a
*NL*
little
money
in
my
pocket
,
and
I
lived
near
a
year
upon
that
,
spending
*NL*
very
sparingly
,
and
eking
things
out
to
the
utmost
;
but
still
when
I
*NL*
looked
before
me
,
my
very
heart
would
sink
within
me
at
the
inevitable
*NL*
approach
of
misery
and
want
.
Oh
let
none
read
this
part
without
*NL*
seriously
reflecting
on
the
circumstances
of
a
desolate
state
,
and
how
*NL*
they
would
grapple
with
mere
want
of
friends
and
want
of
bread
;
it
will
*NL*
certainly
make
them
think
not
of
sparing
what
they
have
only
,
but
of
*NL*
looking
up
to
heaven
for
support
,
and
of
the
wise
man
's
prayer
,
`
Give
*NL*
me
not
poverty
,
lest
I
steal
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Let
them
remember
that
a
time
of
distress
is
a
time
of
dreadful
*NL*
temptation
,
and
all
the
strength
to
resist
is
taken
away
;
poverty
*NL*
presses
,
the
soul
is
made
desperate
by
distress
,
and
what
can
be
done
?
*NL*
It
was
one
evening
,
when
being
brought
,
as
I
may
say
,
to
the
last
gasp
,
*NL*
I
think
I
may
truly
say
I
was
distracted
and
raving
,
when
prompted
by
I
*NL*
know
not
what
spirit
,
and
,
as
it
were
,
doing
I
did
not
know
what
or
*NL*
why
,
I
dressed
me
-LRB-
for
I
had
still
pretty
good
clothes
-RRB-
and
went
out
.
*NL*
I
am
very
sure
I
had
no
manner
of
design
in
my
head
when
I
went
out
;
I
*NL*
neither
knew
nor
considered
where
to
go
,
or
on
what
business
;
but
as
*NL*
the
devil
carried
me
out
and
laid
his
bait
for
me
,
so
he
brought
me
,
to
*NL*
be
sure
,
to
the
place
,
for
I
knew
not
whither
I
was
going
or
what
I
did
.
*NL*
*NL*
Wandering
thus
about
,
I
knew
not
whither
,
I
passed
by
an
apothecary
's
*NL*
shop
in
Leadenhall
Street
,
when
I
saw
lie
on
a
stool
just
before
the
*NL*
counter
a
little
bundle
wrapped
in
a
white
cloth
;
beyond
it
stood
a
*NL*
maid-servant
with
her
back
to
it
,
looking
towards
the
top
of
the
shop
,
*NL*
where
the
apothecary
's
apprentice
,
as
I
suppose
,
was
standing
upon
the
*NL*
counter
,
with
his
back
also
to
the
door
,
and
a
candle
in
his
hand
,
*NL*
looking
and
reaching
up
to
the
upper
shelf
for
something
he
wanted
,
so
*NL*
that
both
were
engaged
mighty
earnestly
,
and
nobody
else
in
the
shop
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
bait
;
and
the
devil
,
who
I
said
laid
the
snare
,
as
readily
*NL*
prompted
me
as
if
he
had
spoke
,
for
I
remember
,
and
shall
never
forget
*NL*
it
,
't
was
like
a
voice
spoken
to
me
over
my
shoulder
,
`
Take
the
bundle
;
*NL*
be
quick
;
do
it
this
moment
.
'
It
was
no
sooner
said
but
I
stepped
into
*NL*
the
shop
,
and
with
my
back
to
the
wench
,
as
if
I
had
stood
up
for
a
*NL*
cart
that
was
going
by
,
I
put
my
hand
behind
me
and
took
the
bundle
,
*NL*
and
went
off
with
it
,
the
maid
or
the
fellow
not
perceiving
me
,
or
any
*NL*
one
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
impossible
to
express
the
horror
of
my
soul
all
the
while
I
did
*NL*
it
.
When
I
went
away
I
had
no
heart
to
run
,
or
scarce
to
mend
my
pace
.
*NL*
I
crossed
the
street
indeed
,
and
went
down
the
first
turning
I
came
to
,
*NL*
and
I
think
it
was
a
street
that
went
through
into
Fenchurch
Street
.
*NL*
From
thence
I
crossed
and
turned
through
so
many
ways
and
turnings
,
*NL*
that
I
could
never
tell
which
way
it
was
,
not
where
I
went
;
for
I
felt
*NL*
not
the
ground
I
stepped
on
,
and
the
farther
I
was
out
of
danger
,
the
*NL*
faster
I
went
,
till
,
tired
and
out
of
breath
,
I
was
forced
to
sit
down
*NL*
on
a
little
bench
at
a
door
,
and
then
I
began
to
recover
,
and
found
I
*NL*
was
got
into
Thames
Street
,
near
Billingsgate
.
I
rested
me
a
little
*NL*
and
went
on
;
my
blood
was
all
in
a
fire
;
my
heart
beat
as
if
I
was
in
a
*NL*
sudden
fright
.
In
short
,
I
was
under
such
a
surprise
that
I
still
knew
*NL*
not
wither
I
was
going
,
or
what
to
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
I
had
tired
myself
thus
with
walking
a
long
way
about
,
and
so
*NL*
eagerly
,
I
began
to
consider
and
make
home
to
my
lodging
,
where
I
came
*NL*
about
nine
o'clock
at
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
bundle
was
made
up
for
,
or
on
what
occasion
laid
where
I
found
*NL*
it
,
I
knew
not
,
but
when
I
came
to
open
it
I
found
there
was
a
suit
of
*NL*
childbed-linen
in
it
,
very
good
and
almost
new
,
the
lace
very
fine
;
*NL*
there
was
a
silver
porringer
of
a
pint
,
a
small
silver
mug
and
six
*NL*
spoons
,
with
some
other
linen
,
a
good
smock
,
and
three
silk
*NL*
handkerchiefs
,
and
in
the
mug
,
wrapped
up
in
a
paper
,
18s
.
6d
.
in
money
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
while
I
was
opening
these
things
I
was
under
such
dreadful
*NL*
impressions
of
fear
,
and
I
such
terror
of
mind
,
though
I
was
perfectly
*NL*
safe
,
that
I
can
not
express
the
manner
of
it
.
I
sat
me
down
,
and
cried
*NL*
most
vehemently
.
`
Lord
,
'
said
I
,
`
what
am
I
now
?
a
thief
!
Why
,
I
*NL*
shall
be
taken
next
time
,
and
be
carried
to
Newgate
and
be
tried
for
my
*NL*
life
!
'
And
with
that
I
cried
again
a
long
time
,
and
I
am
sure
,
as
poor
*NL*
as
I
was
,
if
I
had
durst
for
fear
,
I
would
certainly
have
carried
the
*NL*
things
back
again
;
but
that
went
off
after
a
while
.
Well
,
I
went
to
*NL*
bed
for
that
night
,
but
slept
little
;
the
horror
of
the
fact
was
upon
*NL*
my
mind
,
and
I
knew
not
what
I
said
or
did
all
night
,
and
all
the
next
*NL*
day
.
Then
I
was
impatient
to
hear
some
news
of
the
loss
;
and
would
*NL*
fain
know
how
it
was
,
whether
they
were
a
poor
body
's
goods
,
or
a
rich
.
*NL*
`
Perhaps
,
'
said
I
,
`
it
may
be
some
poor
widow
like
me
,
that
had
packed
*NL*
up
these
goods
to
go
and
sell
them
for
a
little
bread
for
herself
and
a
*NL*
poor
child
,
and
are
now
starving
and
breaking
their
hearts
for
want
of
*NL*
that
little
they
would
have
fetched
.
'
And
this
thought
tormented
me
*NL*
worse
than
all
the
rest
,
for
three
or
four
days
'
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
my
own
distresses
silenced
all
these
reflections
,
and
the
prospect
*NL*
of
my
own
starving
,
which
grew
every
day
more
frightful
to
me
,
hardened
*NL*
my
heart
by
degrees
.
It
was
then
particularly
heavy
upon
my
mind
,
that
*NL*
I
had
been
reformed
,
and
had
,
as
I
hoped
,
repented
of
all
my
past
*NL*
wickedness
;
that
I
had
lived
a
sober
,
grave
,
retired
life
for
several
*NL*
years
,
but
now
I
should
be
driven
by
the
dreadful
necessity
of
my
*NL*
circumstances
to
the
gates
of
destruction
,
soul
and
body
;
and
two
or
*NL*
three
times
I
fell
upon
my
knees
,
praying
to
God
,
as
well
as
I
could
,
*NL*
for
deliverance
;
but
I
can
not
but
say
,
my
prayers
had
no
hope
in
them
.
*NL*
I
knew
not
what
to
do
;
it
was
all
fear
without
,
and
dark
within
;
and
I
*NL*
reflected
on
my
past
life
as
not
sincerely
repented
of
,
that
Heaven
was
*NL*
now
beginning
to
punish
me
on
this
side
the
grave
,
and
would
make
me
as
*NL*
miserable
as
I
had
been
wicked
.
*NL*
*NL*
Had
I
gone
on
here
I
had
perhaps
been
a
true
penitent
;
but
I
had
an
*NL*
evil
counsellor
within
,
and
he
was
continually
prompting
me
to
relieve
*NL*
myself
by
the
worst
means
;
so
one
evening
he
tempted
me
again
,
by
the
*NL*
same
wicked
impulse
that
had
said
`
Take
that
bundle
,
'
to
go
out
again
*NL*
and
seek
for
what
might
happen
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
went
out
now
by
daylight
,
and
wandered
about
I
knew
not
whither
,
and
*NL*
in
search
of
I
knew
not
what
,
when
the
devil
put
a
snare
in
my
way
of
a
*NL*
dreadful
nature
indeed
,
and
such
a
one
as
I
have
never
had
before
or
*NL*
since
.
Going
through
Aldersgate
Street
,
there
was
a
pretty
little
*NL*
child
who
had
been
at
a
dancing-school
,
and
was
going
home
,
all
alone
;
*NL*
and
my
prompter
,
like
a
true
devil
,
set
me
upon
this
innocent
creature
.
*NL*
I
talked
to
it
,
and
it
prattled
to
me
again
,
and
I
took
it
by
the
hand
*NL*
and
led
it
along
till
I
came
to
a
paved
alley
that
goes
into
*NL*
Bartholomew
Close
,
and
I
led
it
in
there
.
The
child
said
that
was
not
*NL*
its
way
home
.
I
said
,
`
Yes
,
my
dear
,
it
is
;
I
'll
show
you
the
way
*NL*
home
.
'
The
child
had
a
little
necklace
on
of
gold
beads
,
and
I
had
my
*NL*
eye
upon
that
,
and
in
the
dark
of
the
alley
I
stooped
,
pretending
to
*NL*
mend
the
child
's
clog
that
was
loose
,
and
took
off
her
necklace
,
and
*NL*
the
child
never
felt
it
,
and
so
led
the
child
on
again
.
Here
,
I
say
,
*NL*
the
devil
put
me
upon
killing
the
child
in
the
dark
alley
,
that
it
*NL*
might
not
cry
,
but
the
very
thought
frighted
me
so
that
I
was
ready
to
*NL*
drop
down
;
but
I
turned
the
child
about
and
bade
it
go
back
again
,
for
*NL*
that
was
not
its
way
home
.
The
child
said
,
so
she
would
,
and
I
went
*NL*
through
into
Bartholomew
Close
,
and
then
turned
round
to
another
*NL*
passage
that
goes
into
St.
John
Street
;
then
,
crossing
into
Smithfield
,
*NL*
went
down
Chick
Lane
and
into
Field
Lane
to
Holborn
Bridge
,
when
,
*NL*
mixing
with
the
crowd
of
people
usually
passing
there
,
it
was
not
*NL*
possible
to
have
been
found
out
;
and
thus
I
enterprised
my
second
sally
*NL*
into
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
thoughts
of
this
booty
put
out
all
the
thoughts
of
the
first
,
and
*NL*
the
reflections
I
had
made
wore
quickly
off
;
poverty
,
as
I
have
said
,
*NL*
hardened
my
heart
,
and
my
own
necessities
made
me
regardless
of
*NL*
anything
.
The
last
affair
left
no
great
concern
upon
me
,
for
as
I
did
*NL*
the
poor
child
no
harm
,
I
only
said
to
myself
,
I
had
given
the
parents
*NL*
a
just
reproof
for
their
negligence
in
leaving
the
poor
little
lamb
to
*NL*
come
home
by
itself
,
and
it
would
teach
them
to
take
more
care
of
it
*NL*
another
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
string
of
beads
was
worth
about
twelve
or
fourteen
pounds
.
I
*NL*
suppose
it
might
have
been
formerly
the
mother
's
,
for
it
was
too
big
*NL*
for
the
child
's
wear
,
but
that
perhaps
the
vanity
of
the
mother
,
to
*NL*
have
her
child
look
fine
at
the
dancing-school
,
had
made
her
let
the
*NL*
child
wear
it
;
and
no
doubt
the
child
had
a
maid
sent
to
take
care
of
*NL*
it
,
but
she
,
careless
jade
,
was
taken
up
perhaps
with
some
fellow
that
*NL*
had
met
her
by
the
way
,
and
so
the
poor
baby
wandered
till
it
fell
into
*NL*
my
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
I
did
the
child
no
harm
;
I
did
not
so
much
as
fright
it
,
for
I
*NL*
had
a
great
many
tender
thoughts
about
me
yet
,
and
did
nothing
but
*NL*
what
,
as
I
may
say
,
mere
necessity
drove
me
to
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
a
great
many
adventures
after
this
,
but
I
was
young
in
the
*NL*
business
,
and
did
not
know
how
to
manage
,
otherwise
than
as
the
devil
*NL*
put
things
into
my
head
;
and
indeed
he
was
seldom
backward
to
me
.
One
*NL*
adventure
I
had
which
was
very
lucky
to
me
.
I
was
going
through
*NL*
Lombard
Street
in
the
dusk
of
the
evening
,
just
by
the
end
of
Three
*NL*
King
court
,
when
on
a
sudden
comes
a
fellow
running
by
me
as
swift
as
*NL*
lightning
,
and
throws
a
bundle
that
was
in
his
hand
,
just
behind
me
,
as
*NL*
I
stood
up
against
the
corner
of
the
house
at
the
turning
into
the
*NL*
alley
.
Just
as
he
threw
it
in
he
said
,
`
God
bless
you
,
mistress
,
let
*NL*
it
lie
there
a
little
,
'
and
away
he
runs
swift
as
the
wind
.
After
him
*NL*
comes
two
more
,
and
immediately
a
young
fellow
without
his
hat
,
crying
*NL*
`
Stop
thief
!
'
and
after
him
two
or
three
more
.
They
pursued
the
two
*NL*
last
fellows
so
close
,
that
they
were
forced
to
drop
what
they
had
got
,
*NL*
and
one
of
them
was
taken
into
the
bargain
,
and
other
got
off
free
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
stood
stock-still
all
this
while
,
till
they
came
back
,
dragging
the
*NL*
poor
fellow
they
had
taken
,
and
lugging
the
things
they
had
found
,
*NL*
extremely
well
satisfied
that
they
had
recovered
the
booty
and
taken
*NL*
the
thief
;
and
thus
they
passed
by
me
,
for
I
looked
only
like
one
who
*NL*
stood
up
while
the
crowd
was
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
Once
or
twice
I
asked
what
was
the
matter
,
but
the
people
neglected
*NL*
answering
me
,
and
I
was
not
very
importunate
;
but
after
the
crowd
was
*NL*
wholly
past
,
I
took
my
opportunity
to
turn
about
and
take
up
what
was
*NL*
behind
me
and
walk
away
.
This
,
indeed
,
I
did
with
less
disturbance
*NL*
than
I
had
done
formerly
,
for
these
things
I
did
not
steal
,
but
they
*NL*
were
stolen
to
my
hand
.
I
got
safe
to
my
lodgings
with
this
cargo
,
*NL*
which
was
a
piece
of
fine
black
lustring
silk
,
and
a
piece
of
velvet
;
*NL*
the
latter
was
but
part
of
a
piece
of
about
eleven
yards
;
the
former
*NL*
was
a
whole
piece
of
near
fifty
yards
.
It
seems
it
was
a
mercer
's
shop
*NL*
that
they
had
rifled
.
I
say
rifled
,
because
the
goods
were
so
*NL*
considerable
that
they
had
lost
;
for
the
goods
that
they
recovered
were
*NL*
pretty
many
,
and
I
believe
came
to
about
six
or
seven
several
pieces
of
*NL*
silk
.
How
they
came
to
get
so
many
I
could
not
tell
;
but
as
I
had
only
*NL*
robbed
the
thief
,
I
made
no
scruple
at
taking
these
goods
,
and
being
*NL*
very
glad
of
them
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
pretty
good
luck
thus
far
,
and
I
made
several
adventures
more
,
*NL*
though
with
but
small
purchase
,
yet
with
good
success
,
but
I
went
in
*NL*
daily
dread
that
some
mischief
would
befall
me
,
and
that
I
should
*NL*
certainly
come
to
be
hanged
at
last
.
The
impression
this
made
on
me
*NL*
was
too
strong
to
be
slighted
,
and
it
kept
me
from
making
attempts
*NL*
that
,
for
ought
I
knew
,
might
have
been
very
safely
performed
;
but
one
*NL*
thing
I
can
not
omit
,
which
was
a
bait
to
me
many
a
day
.
I
walked
*NL*
frequently
out
into
the
villages
round
the
town
,
to
see
if
nothing
*NL*
would
fall
in
my
way
there
;
and
going
by
a
house
near
Stepney
,
I
saw
on
*NL*
the
window-board
two
rings
,
one
a
small
diamond
ring
,
and
the
other
a
*NL*
gold
ring
,
to
be
sure
laid
there
by
some
thoughtless
lady
,
that
had
*NL*
more
money
then
forecast
,
perhaps
only
till
she
washed
her
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
walked
several
times
by
the
window
to
observe
if
I
could
see
whether
*NL*
there
was
anybody
in
the
room
or
no
,
and
I
could
see
nobody
,
but
still
*NL*
I
was
not
sure
.
It
came
presently
into
my
thoughts
to
rap
at
the
*NL*
glass
,
as
if
I
wanted
to
speak
with
somebody
,
and
if
anybody
was
there
*NL*
they
would
be
sure
to
come
to
the
window
,
and
then
I
would
tell
them
to
*NL*
remove
those
rings
,
for
that
I
had
seen
two
suspicious
fellows
take
*NL*
notice
of
them
.
This
was
a
ready
thought
.
I
rapped
once
or
twice
and
*NL*
nobody
came
,
when
,
seeing
the
coast
clear
,
I
thrust
hard
against
the
*NL*
square
of
the
glass
,
and
broke
it
with
very
little
noise
,
and
took
out
*NL*
the
two
rings
,
and
walked
away
with
them
very
safe
.
The
diamond
ring
*NL*
was
worth
about
#
3
,
and
the
other
about
9s
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
now
at
a
loss
for
a
market
for
my
goods
,
and
especially
for
my
*NL*
two
pieces
of
silk
.
I
was
very
loth
to
dispose
of
them
for
a
trifle
,
*NL*
as
the
poor
unhappy
thieves
in
general
do
,
who
,
after
they
have
*NL*
ventured
their
lives
for
perhaps
a
thing
of
value
,
are
fain
to
sell
it
*NL*
for
a
song
when
they
have
done
;
but
I
was
resolved
I
would
not
do
thus
,
*NL*
whatever
shift
I
made
,
unless
I
was
driven
to
the
last
extremity
.
*NL*
However
,
I
did
not
well
know
what
course
to
take
.
At
last
I
resolved
*NL*
to
go
to
my
old
governess
,
and
acquaint
myself
with
her
again
.
I
had
*NL*
punctually
supplied
the
#
5
a
year
to
her
for
my
little
boy
as
long
as
I
*NL*
was
able
,
but
at
last
was
obliged
to
put
a
stop
to
it
.
However
,
I
had
*NL*
written
a
letter
to
her
,
wherein
I
had
told
her
that
my
circumstances
*NL*
were
reduced
very
low
;
that
I
had
lost
my
husband
,
and
that
I
was
not
*NL*
able
to
do
it
any
longer
,
and
so
begged
that
the
poor
child
might
not
*NL*
suffer
too
much
for
its
mother
's
misfortunes
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
now
made
her
a
visit
,
and
I
found
that
she
drove
something
of
the
old
*NL*
trade
still
,
but
that
she
was
not
in
such
flourishing
circumstances
as
*NL*
before
;
for
she
had
been
sued
by
a
certain
gentleman
who
had
had
his
*NL*
daughter
stolen
from
him
,
and
who
,
it
seems
,
she
had
helped
to
convey
*NL*
away
;
and
it
was
very
narrowly
that
she
escaped
the
gallows
.
The
*NL*
expense
also
had
ravaged
her
,
and
she
was
become
very
poor
;
her
house
*NL*
was
but
meanly
furnished
,
and
she
was
not
in
such
repute
for
her
*NL*
practice
as
before
;
however
,
she
stood
upon
her
legs
,
as
they
say
,
and
*NL*
a
she
was
a
stirring
,
bustling
woman
,
and
had
some
stock
left
,
she
was
*NL*
turned
pawnbroker
,
and
lived
pretty
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
received
me
very
civilly
,
and
with
her
usual
obliging
manner
told
*NL*
me
she
would
not
have
the
less
respect
for
me
for
my
being
reduced
;
*NL*
that
she
had
taken
care
my
boy
was
very
well
looked
after
,
though
I
*NL*
could
not
pay
for
him
,
and
that
the
woman
that
had
him
was
easy
,
so
*NL*
that
I
needed
not
to
trouble
myself
about
him
till
I
might
be
better
*NL*
able
to
do
it
effectually
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
told
her
that
I
had
not
much
money
left
,
but
that
I
had
some
things
*NL*
that
were
money
's
worth
,
if
she
could
tell
me
how
I
might
turn
them
*NL*
into
money
.
She
asked
me
what
it
was
I
had
.
I
pulled
out
the
string
*NL*
of
gold
beads
,
and
told
her
it
was
one
of
my
husband
's
presents
to
me
;
*NL*
then
I
showed
her
the
two
parcels
of
silk
,
which
I
told
her
I
had
from
*NL*
Ireland
,
and
brought
up
to
town
with
me
;
and
the
little
diamond
ring
.
*NL*
As
to
the
small
parcel
of
plate
and
spoons
,
I
had
found
means
to
*NL*
dispose
of
them
myself
before
;
and
as
for
the
childbed-linen
I
had
,
she
*NL*
offered
me
to
take
it
herself
,
believing
it
to
have
been
my
own
.
She
*NL*
told
me
that
she
was
turned
pawnbroker
,
and
that
she
would
sell
those
*NL*
things
for
me
as
pawn
to
her
;
and
so
she
sent
presently
for
proper
*NL*
agents
that
bought
them
,
being
in
her
hands
,
without
any
scruple
,
and
*NL*
gave
good
prices
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
now
began
to
think
this
necessary
woman
might
help
me
a
little
in
my
*NL*
low
condition
to
some
business
,
for
I
would
gladly
have
turned
my
hand
*NL*
to
any
honest
employment
if
I
could
have
got
it
.
But
here
she
was
*NL*
deficient
;
honest
business
did
not
come
within
her
reach
.
If
I
had
*NL*
been
younger
,
perhaps
she
might
have
helped
me
to
a
spark
,
but
my
*NL*
thoughts
were
off
that
kind
of
livelihood
,
as
being
quite
out
of
the
*NL*
way
after
fifty
,
which
was
my
case
,
and
so
I
told
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
invited
me
at
last
to
come
,
and
be
at
her
house
till
I
could
find
*NL*
something
to
do
,
and
it
should
cost
me
very
little
,
and
this
I
gladly
*NL*
accepted
of
.
And
now
living
a
little
easier
,
I
entered
into
some
*NL*
measures
to
have
my
little
son
by
my
last
husband
taken
off
;
and
this
*NL*
she
made
easy
too
,
reserving
a
payment
only
of
#
5
a
year
,
if
I
could
*NL*
pay
it
.
This
was
such
a
help
to
me
,
that
for
a
good
while
I
left
off
*NL*
the
wicked
trade
that
I
had
so
newly
taken
up
;
and
gladly
I
would
have
*NL*
got
my
bread
by
the
help
of
my
needle
if
I
could
have
got
work
,
but
*NL*
that
was
very
hard
to
do
for
one
that
had
no
manner
of
acquaintance
in
*NL*
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
at
last
I
got
some
quilting
work
for
ladies
'
beds
,
petticoats
,
*NL*
and
the
like
;
and
this
I
liked
very
well
,
and
worked
very
hard
,
and
*NL*
with
this
I
began
to
live
;
but
the
diligent
devil
,
who
resolved
I
*NL*
should
continue
in
his
service
,
continually
prompted
me
to
go
out
and
*NL*
take
a
walk
,
that
is
to
say
,
to
see
if
anything
would
offer
in
the
old
*NL*
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
evening
I
blindly
obeyed
his
summons
,
and
fetched
a
long
circuit
*NL*
through
the
streets
,
but
met
with
no
purchase
,
and
came
home
very
weary
*NL*
and
empty
;
but
not
content
with
that
,
I
went
out
the
next
evening
too
,
*NL*
when
going
by
an
alehouse
I
saw
the
door
of
a
little
room
open
,
next
*NL*
the
very
street
,
and
on
the
table
a
silver
tankard
,
things
much
in
use
*NL*
in
public-houses
at
that
time
.
It
seems
some
company
had
been
drinking
*NL*
there
,
and
the
careless
boys
had
forgot
to
take
it
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
went
into
the
box
frankly
,
and
setting
the
silver
tankard
on
the
*NL*
corner
of
the
bench
,
I
sat
down
before
it
,
and
knocked
with
my
foot
;
a
*NL*
boy
came
presently
,
and
I
bade
him
fetch
me
a
pint
of
warm
ale
,
for
it
*NL*
was
cold
weather
;
the
boy
ran
,
and
I
heard
him
go
down
the
cellar
to
*NL*
draw
the
ale
.
While
the
boy
was
gone
,
another
boy
came
into
the
room
,
*NL*
and
cried
,
'D
'
ye
call
?
'
I
spoke
with
a
melancholy
air
,
and
said
,
`
No
,
*NL*
child
;
the
boy
is
gone
for
a
pint
of
ale
for
me
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
While
I
sat
here
,
I
heard
the
woman
in
the
bar
say
,
`
Are
they
all
gone
*NL*
in
the
five
?
'
which
was
the
box
I
sat
in
,
and
the
boy
said
,
`
Yes
.
'
`
Who
*NL*
fetched
the
tankard
away
?
'
says
the
woman
.
'
I
did
,
'
says
another
boy
;
*NL*
`
that
's
it
,
'
pointing
,
it
seems
,
to
another
tankard
,
which
he
had
*NL*
fetched
from
another
box
by
mistake
;
or
else
it
must
be
,
that
the
rogue
*NL*
forgot
that
he
had
not
brought
it
in
,
which
certainly
he
had
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
heard
all
this
,
much
to
my
satisfaction
,
for
I
found
plainly
that
the
*NL*
tankard
was
not
missed
,
and
yet
they
concluded
it
was
fetched
away
;
so
*NL*
I
drank
my
ale
,
called
to
pay
,
and
as
I
went
away
I
said
,
`
Take
care
of
*NL*
your
plate
,
child
,
'
meaning
a
silver
pint
mug
,
which
he
brought
me
*NL*
drink
in
.
The
boy
said
,
`
Yes
,
madam
,
very
welcome
,
'
and
away
I
came
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
came
home
to
my
governess
,
and
now
I
thought
it
was
a
time
to
try
*NL*
her
,
that
if
I
might
be
put
to
the
necessity
of
being
exposed
,
she
*NL*
might
offer
me
some
assistance
.
When
I
had
been
at
home
some
time
,
and
*NL*
had
an
opportunity
of
talking
to
her
,
I
told
her
I
had
a
secret
of
the
*NL*
greatest
consequence
in
the
world
to
commit
to
her
,
if
she
had
respect
*NL*
enough
for
me
to
keep
it
a
secret
.
She
told
me
she
had
kept
one
of
my
*NL*
secrets
faithfully
;
why
should
I
doubt
her
keeping
another
?
I
told
her
*NL*
the
strangest
thing
in
the
world
had
befallen
me
,
and
that
it
had
made
*NL*
a
thief
of
me
,
even
without
any
design
,
and
so
told
her
the
whole
story
*NL*
of
the
tankard
.
`
And
have
you
brought
it
away
with
you
,
my
dear
?
'
says
*NL*
she
.
`
To
be
sure
I
have
,
'
says
I
,
and
showed
it
her
.
`
But
what
shall
*NL*
I
do
now
,
'
says
I
;
`
must
not
carry
it
again
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Carry
it
again
!
'
says
she
.
`
Ay
,
if
you
are
minded
to
be
sent
to
*NL*
Newgate
for
stealing
it
.
'
`
Why
,
'
says
I
,
`
they
ca
n't
be
so
base
to
*NL*
stop
me
,
when
I
carry
it
to
them
again
?
'
`
You
do
n't
know
those
sort
of
*NL*
people
,
child
,
'
says
she
;
`
they
'll
not
only
carry
you
to
Newgate
,
but
*NL*
hang
you
too
,
without
any
regard
to
the
honesty
of
returning
it
;
or
*NL*
bring
in
an
account
of
all
the
other
tankards
they
have
lost
,
for
you
*NL*
to
pay
for
.
'
`
What
must
I
do
,
then
?
'
says
I.
`
Nay
,
'
says
she
,
`
as
you
*NL*
have
played
the
cunning
part
and
stole
it
,
you
must
e
`
en
keep
it
;
*NL*
there
's
no
going
back
now
.
Besides
,
child
,
'
says
she
,
`
do
n't
you
want
*NL*
it
more
than
they
do
?
I
wish
you
could
light
of
such
a
bargain
once
a
*NL*
week
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
This
gave
me
a
new
notion
of
my
governess
,
and
that
since
she
was
*NL*
turned
pawnbroker
,
she
had
a
sort
of
people
about
her
that
were
none
of
*NL*
the
honest
ones
that
I
had
met
with
there
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
not
been
long
there
but
I
discovered
it
more
plainly
than
before
,
*NL*
for
every
now
and
then
I
saw
hilts
of
swords
,
spoons
,
forks
,
tankards
,
*NL*
and
all
such
kind
of
ware
brought
in
,
not
to
be
pawned
,
but
to
be
sold
*NL*
downright
;
and
she
bought
everything
that
came
without
asking
any
*NL*
questions
,
but
had
very
good
bargains
,
as
I
found
by
her
discourse
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
found
also
that
in
following
this
trade
she
always
melted
down
the
*NL*
plate
she
bought
,
that
it
might
not
be
challenged
;
and
she
came
to
me
*NL*
and
told
me
one
morning
that
she
was
going
to
melt
,
and
if
I
would
,
she
*NL*
would
put
my
tankard
in
,
that
it
might
not
be
seen
by
anybody
.
I
told
*NL*
her
,
with
all
my
heart
;
so
she
weighed
it
,
and
allowed
me
the
full
*NL*
value
in
silver
again
;
but
I
found
she
did
not
do
the
same
to
the
rest
*NL*
of
her
customers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
time
after
this
,
as
I
was
at
work
,
and
very
melancholy
,
she
begins
*NL*
to
ask
me
what
the
matter
was
,
as
she
was
used
to
do
.
I
told
her
my
*NL*
heart
was
heavy
;
I
had
little
work
,
and
nothing
to
live
on
,
and
knew
*NL*
not
what
course
to
take
.
She
laughed
,
and
told
me
I
must
go
out
again
*NL*
and
try
my
fortune
;
it
might
be
that
I
might
meet
with
another
piece
of
*NL*
plate
.
'
O
mother
!
'
says
I
,
`
that
is
a
trade
I
have
no
skill
in
,
and
if
*NL*
I
should
be
taken
I
am
undone
at
once
.
'
Says
she
,
'
I
could
help
you
to
*NL*
a
schoolmistress
that
shall
make
you
as
dexterous
as
herself
.
'
I
*NL*
trembled
at
that
proposal
,
for
hitherto
I
had
had
no
confederates
,
nor
*NL*
any
acquaintance
among
that
tribe
.
But
she
conquered
all
my
modesty
,
*NL*
and
all
my
fears
;
and
in
a
little
time
,
by
the
help
of
this
*NL*
confederate
,
I
grew
as
impudent
a
thief
,
and
as
dexterous
as
ever
Moll
*NL*
Cutpurse
was
,
though
,
if
fame
does
not
belie
her
,
not
half
so
handsome
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
comrade
she
helped
me
to
dealt
in
three
sorts
of
craft
,
viz
.
*NL*
shoplifting
,
stealing
of
shop-books
and
pocket-books
,
and
taking
off
*NL*
gold
watches
from
the
ladies
'
sides
;
and
this
last
she
did
so
*NL*
dexterously
that
no
woman
ever
arrived
to
the
performance
of
that
art
*NL*
so
as
to
do
it
like
her
.
I
liked
the
first
and
the
last
of
these
*NL*
things
very
well
,
and
I
attended
her
some
time
in
the
practice
,
just
as
*NL*
a
deputy
attends
a
midwife
,
without
any
pay
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
she
put
me
to
practice
.
She
had
shown
me
her
art
,
and
I
had
*NL*
several
times
unhooked
a
watch
from
her
own
side
with
great
dexterity
.
*NL*
At
last
she
showed
me
a
prize
,
and
this
was
a
young
lady
big
with
*NL*
child
,
who
had
a
charming
watch
.
The
thing
was
to
be
done
as
she
came
*NL*
out
of
church
.
She
goes
on
one
side
of
the
lady
,
and
pretends
,
just
as
*NL*
she
came
to
the
steps
,
to
fall
,
and
fell
against
the
lady
with
so
much
*NL*
violence
as
put
her
into
a
great
fright
,
and
both
cried
out
terribly
.
*NL*
In
the
very
moment
that
she
jostled
the
lady
,
I
had
hold
of
the
watch
,
*NL*
and
holding
it
the
right
way
,
the
start
she
gave
drew
the
hook
out
,
and
*NL*
she
never
felt
it
.
I
made
off
immediately
,
and
left
my
schoolmistress
*NL*
to
come
out
of
her
pretended
fright
gradually
,
and
the
lady
too
;
and
*NL*
presently
the
watch
was
missed
.
`
Ay
,
'
says
my
comrade
,
`
then
it
was
*NL*
those
rogues
that
thrust
me
down
,
I
warrant
ye
;
I
wonder
the
*NL*
gentlewoman
did
not
miss
her
watch
before
,
then
we
might
have
taken
*NL*
them
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
humoured
the
thing
so
well
that
nobody
suspected
her
,
and
I
was
got
*NL*
home
a
full
hour
before
her
.
This
was
my
first
adventure
in
company
.
*NL*
The
watch
was
indeed
a
very
fine
one
,
and
had
a
great
many
trinkets
*NL*
about
it
,
and
my
governess
allowed
us
#
20
for
it
,
of
which
I
had
half
.
*NL*
And
thus
I
was
entered
a
complete
thief
,
hardened
to
the
pitch
above
*NL*
all
the
reflections
of
conscience
or
modesty
,
and
to
a
degree
which
I
*NL*
must
acknowledge
I
never
thought
possible
in
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
the
devil
,
who
began
,
by
the
help
of
an
irresistible
poverty
,
to
*NL*
push
me
into
this
wickedness
,
brought
me
on
to
a
height
beyond
the
*NL*
common
rate
,
even
when
my
necessities
were
not
so
great
,
or
the
*NL*
prospect
of
my
misery
so
terrifying
;
for
I
had
now
got
into
a
little
*NL*
vein
of
work
,
and
as
I
was
not
at
a
loss
to
handle
my
needle
,
it
was
*NL*
very
probable
,
as
acquaintance
came
in
,
I
might
have
got
my
bread
*NL*
honestly
enough
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
must
say
,
that
if
such
a
prospect
of
work
had
presented
itself
at
*NL*
first
,
when
I
began
to
feel
the
approach
of
my
miserable
*NL*
circumstances
--
I
say
,
had
such
a
prospect
of
getting
my
bread
by
*NL*
working
presented
itself
then
,
I
had
never
fallen
into
this
wicked
*NL*
trade
,
or
into
such
a
wicked
gang
as
I
was
now
embarked
with
;
but
*NL*
practice
had
hardened
me
,
and
I
grew
audacious
to
the
last
degree
;
and
*NL*
the
more
so
because
I
had
carried
it
on
so
long
,
and
had
never
been
*NL*
taken
;
for
,
in
a
word
,
my
new
partner
in
wickedness
and
I
went
on
*NL*
together
so
long
,
without
being
ever
detected
,
that
we
not
only
grew
*NL*
bold
,
but
we
grew
rich
,
and
we
had
at
one
time
one-and-twenty
gold
*NL*
watches
in
our
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
remember
that
one
day
being
a
little
more
serious
than
ordinary
,
and
*NL*
finding
I
had
so
good
a
stock
beforehand
as
I
had
,
for
I
had
near
#
200
*NL*
in
money
for
my
share
,
it
came
strongly
into
my
mind
,
no
doubt
from
*NL*
some
kind
spirit
,
if
such
there
be
,
that
at
first
poverty
excited
me
,
*NL*
and
my
distresses
drove
me
to
these
dreadful
shifts
;
so
seeing
those
*NL*
distresses
were
now
relieved
,
and
I
could
also
get
something
towards
a
*NL*
maintenance
by
working
,
and
had
so
good
a
bank
to
support
me
,
why
*NL*
should
I
now
not
leave
off
,
as
they
say
,
while
I
was
well
?
that
I
could
*NL*
not
expect
to
go
always
free
;
and
if
I
was
once
surprised
,
and
*NL*
miscarried
,
I
was
undone
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
doubtless
the
happy
minute
,
when
,
if
I
had
hearkened
to
the
*NL*
blessed
hint
,
from
whatsoever
had
it
came
,
I
had
still
a
cast
for
an
*NL*
easy
life
.
But
my
fate
was
otherwise
determined
;
the
busy
devil
that
*NL*
so
industriously
drew
me
in
had
too
fast
hold
of
me
to
let
me
go
back
;
*NL*
but
as
poverty
brought
me
into
the
mire
,
so
avarice
kept
me
in
,
till
*NL*
there
was
no
going
back
.
As
to
the
arguments
which
my
reason
dictated
*NL*
for
persuading
me
to
lay
down
,
avarice
stepped
in
and
said
,
`
Go
on
,
go
*NL*
on
;
you
have
had
very
good
luck
;
go
on
till
you
have
gotten
four
or
*NL*
five
hundred
pounds
,
and
then
you
shall
leave
off
,
and
then
you
may
*NL*
live
easy
without
working
at
all
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
I
,
that
was
once
in
the
devil
's
clutches
,
was
held
fast
there
as
*NL*
with
a
charm
,
and
had
no
power
to
go
without
the
circle
,
till
I
was
*NL*
engulfed
in
labyrinths
of
trouble
too
great
to
get
out
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
these
thoughts
left
some
impression
upon
me
,
and
made
me
act
*NL*
with
some
more
caution
than
before
,
and
more
than
my
directors
used
for
*NL*
themselves
.
My
comrade
,
as
I
called
her
,
but
rather
she
should
have
*NL*
been
called
my
teacher
,
with
another
of
her
scholars
,
was
the
first
in
*NL*
the
misfortune
;
for
,
happening
to
be
upon
the
hunt
for
purchase
,
they
*NL*
made
an
attempt
upon
a
linen-draper
in
Cheapside
,
but
were
snapped
by
a
*NL*
hawk
's
-
eyed
journeyman
,
and
seized
with
two
pieces
of
cambric
,
which
*NL*
were
taken
also
upon
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
enough
to
lodge
them
both
in
Newgate
,
where
they
had
the
*NL*
misfortune
to
have
some
of
their
former
sins
brought
to
remembrance
.
*NL*
Two
other
indictments
being
brought
against
them
,
and
the
facts
being
*NL*
proved
upon
them
,
they
were
both
condemned
to
die
.
They
both
pleaded
*NL*
their
bellies
,
and
were
both
voted
quick
with
child
;
though
my
tutoress
*NL*
was
no
more
with
child
than
I
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
went
frequently
to
see
them
,
and
condole
with
them
,
expecting
that
it
*NL*
would
be
my
turn
next
;
but
the
place
gave
me
so
much
horror
,
reflecting
*NL*
that
it
was
the
place
of
my
unhappy
birth
,
and
of
my
mother
's
*NL*
misfortunes
,
and
that
I
could
not
bear
it
,
so
I
was
forced
to
leave
off
*NL*
going
to
see
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
oh
!
could
I
have
but
taken
warning
by
their
disasters
,
I
had
been
*NL*
happy
still
,
for
I
was
yet
free
,
and
had
nothing
brought
against
me
;
*NL*
but
it
could
not
be
,
my
measure
was
not
yet
filled
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
comrade
,
having
the
brand
of
an
old
offender
,
was
executed
;
the
*NL*
young
offender
was
spared
,
having
obtained
a
reprieve
,
but
lay
starving
*NL*
a
long
while
in
prison
,
till
at
last
she
got
her
name
into
what
they
*NL*
call
a
circuit
pardon
,
and
so
came
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
terrible
example
of
my
comrade
frighted
me
heartily
,
and
for
a
*NL*
good
while
I
made
no
excursions
;
but
one
night
,
in
the
neighbourhood
of
*NL*
my
governess
's
house
,
they
cried
`
Fire
.
'
My
governess
looked
out
,
for
*NL*
we
were
all
up
,
and
cried
immediately
that
such
a
gentlewoman
's
house
*NL*
was
all
of
a
light
fire
atop
,
and
so
indeed
it
was
.
Here
she
gives
me
*NL*
a
job
.
`
Now
,
child
,
'
says
she
,
`
there
is
a
rare
opportunity
,
for
the
*NL*
fire
being
so
near
that
you
may
go
to
it
before
the
street
is
blocked
*NL*
up
with
the
crowd
.
'
She
presently
gave
me
my
cue
.
`
Go
,
child
,
'
says
*NL*
she
,
`
to
the
house
,
and
run
in
and
tell
the
lady
,
or
anybody
you
see
,
*NL*
that
you
come
to
help
them
,
and
that
you
came
from
such
a
gentlewoman
*NL*
-LRB-
that
is
,
one
of
her
acquaintance
farther
up
the
street
-RRB-
.
'
She
gave
me
*NL*
the
like
cue
to
the
next
house
,
naming
another
name
that
was
also
an
*NL*
acquaintance
of
the
gentlewoman
of
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
Away
I
went
,
and
,
coming
to
the
house
,
I
found
them
all
in
confusion
,
*NL*
you
may
be
sure
.
I
ran
in
,
and
finding
one
of
the
maids
,
`
Lord
!
*NL*
sweetheart
,
'
says
I
,
`
how
came
this
dismal
accident
?
Where
is
your
*NL*
mistress
?
Any
how
does
she
do
?
Is
she
safe
?
And
where
are
the
*NL*
children
?
I
come
from
Madam
--
to
help
you
.
'
Away
runs
the
maid
.
*NL*
`
Madam
,
madam
,
'
says
she
,
screaming
as
loud
as
she
could
yell
,
`
here
is
*NL*
a
gentlewoman
come
from
Madam
--
to
help
us
.
'
The
poor
woman
,
half
*NL*
out
of
her
wits
,
with
a
bundle
under
her
arm
,
an
two
little
children
,
*NL*
comes
toward
me
.
`
Lord
!
madam
,
'
says
I
,
`
let
me
carry
the
poor
*NL*
children
to
Madam
--
,
'
she
desires
you
to
send
them
;
she
'll
take
care
*NL*
of
the
poor
lambs
;
'
and
immediately
I
takes
one
of
them
out
of
her
*NL*
hand
,
and
she
lifts
the
other
up
into
my
arms
.
`
Ay
,
do
,
for
God
's
*NL*
sake
,
'
says
she
,
`
carry
them
to
her
.
Oh
!
thank
her
for
her
kindness
.
'
*NL*
`
Have
you
anything
else
to
secure
,
madam
?
'
says
I
;
`
she
will
take
care
*NL*
of
it
.
'
`
Oh
dear
!
ay
,
'
says
she
,
`
God
bless
her
,
and
thank
her
.
Take
*NL*
this
bundle
of
plate
and
carry
it
to
her
too
.
Oh
,
she
is
a
good
woman
.
*NL*
Oh
Lord
!
we
are
utterly
ruined
,
utterly
undone
!
'
And
away
she
runs
*NL*
from
me
out
of
her
wits
,
and
the
maids
after
her
;
and
away
comes
I
with
*NL*
the
two
children
and
the
bundle
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
no
sooner
got
into
the
street
but
I
saw
another
woman
come
to
me
.
*NL*
`
Oh
!
'
says
she
,
`
mistress
,
'
in
a
piteous
tone
,
`
you
will
let
fall
the
*NL*
child
.
Come
,
this
is
a
sad
time
;
let
me
help
you
'
;
and
immediately
*NL*
lays
hold
of
my
bundle
to
carry
it
for
me
.
`
No
,
'
says
I
;
`
if
you
will
*NL*
help
me
,
take
the
child
by
the
hand
,
and
lead
it
for
me
but
to
the
*NL*
upper
end
of
the
street
;
I
'll
go
with
you
and
satisfy
you
for
your
*NL*
pains
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
could
not
avoid
going
,
after
what
I
said
;
but
the
creature
,
in
*NL*
short
,
was
one
of
the
same
business
with
me
,
and
wanted
nothing
but
the
*NL*
bundle
;
however
,
she
went
with
me
to
the
door
,
for
she
could
not
help
*NL*
it
.
When
we
were
come
there
I
whispered
her
,
`
Go
,
child
,
'
said
I
,
'
I
*NL*
understand
your
trade
;
you
may
meet
with
purchase
enough
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
understood
me
and
walked
off
.
I
thundered
at
the
door
with
the
*NL*
children
,
and
as
the
people
were
raised
before
by
the
noise
of
the
*NL*
fire
,
I
was
soon
let
in
,
and
I
said
,
`
Is
madam
awake
?
Pray
tell
her
*NL*
Mrs.
--
desires
the
favour
of
her
to
take
the
two
children
in
;
poor
*NL*
lady
,
she
will
be
undone
,
their
house
is
all
of
a
flame
,
'
They
took
*NL*
the
children
in
very
civilly
,
pitied
the
family
in
distress
,
and
away
*NL*
came
I
with
my
bundle
.
One
of
the
maids
asked
me
if
I
was
not
to
*NL*
leave
the
bundle
too
.
I
said
,
`
No
,
sweetheart
,
't
is
to
go
to
another
*NL*
place
;
it
does
not
belong
to
them
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
a
great
way
out
of
the
hurry
now
,
and
so
I
went
on
,
clear
of
*NL*
anybody
's
inquiry
,
and
brought
the
bundle
of
plate
,
which
was
very
*NL*
considerable
,
straight
home
,
and
gave
it
to
my
old
governess
.
She
told
*NL*
me
she
would
not
look
into
it
,
but
bade
me
go
out
again
to
look
for
*NL*
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
gave
me
the
like
cue
to
the
gentlewoman
of
the
next
house
to
that
*NL*
which
was
on
fire
,
and
I
did
my
endeavour
to
go
,
but
by
this
time
the
*NL*
alarm
of
fire
was
so
great
,
and
so
many
engines
playing
,
and
the
street
*NL*
so
thronged
with
people
,
that
I
could
not
get
near
the
house
whatever
I
*NL*
would
do
;
so
I
came
back
again
to
my
governess
's
,
and
taking
the
bundle
*NL*
up
into
my
chamber
,
I
began
to
examine
it
.
It
is
with
horror
that
I
*NL*
tell
what
a
treasure
I
found
there
;
't
is
enough
to
say
,
that
besides
*NL*
most
of
the
family
plate
,
which
was
considerable
,
I
found
a
gold
chain
,
*NL*
an
old-fashioned
thing
,
the
locket
of
which
was
broken
,
so
that
I
*NL*
suppose
it
had
not
been
used
some
years
,
but
the
gold
was
not
the
worse
*NL*
for
that
;
also
a
little
box
of
burying-rings
,
the
lady
's
wedding-ring
,
*NL*
and
some
broken
bits
of
old
lockets
of
gold
,
a
gold
watch
,
and
a
purse
*NL*
with
about
#
24
value
in
old
pieces
of
gold
coin
,
and
several
other
*NL*
things
of
value
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
greatest
and
the
worst
prize
that
ever
I
was
concerned
in
;
*NL*
for
indeed
,
though
,
as
I
have
said
above
,
I
was
hardened
now
beyond
the
*NL*
power
of
all
reflection
in
other
cases
,
yet
it
really
touched
me
to
the
*NL*
very
soul
when
I
looked
into
this
treasure
,
to
think
of
the
poor
*NL*
disconsolate
gentlewoman
who
had
lost
so
much
by
the
fire
besides
;
and
*NL*
who
would
think
,
to
be
sure
,
that
she
had
saved
her
plate
and
best
*NL*
things
;
how
she
would
be
surprised
and
afflicted
when
she
should
find
*NL*
that
she
had
been
deceived
,
and
should
find
that
the
person
that
took
*NL*
her
children
and
her
goods
,
had
not
come
,
as
was
pretended
,
from
the
*NL*
gentlewoman
in
the
next
street
,
but
that
the
children
had
been
put
upon
*NL*
her
without
her
own
knowledge
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
say
,
I
confess
the
inhumanity
of
this
action
moved
me
very
much
,
and
*NL*
made
me
relent
exceedingly
,
and
tears
stood
in
my
eyes
upon
that
*NL*
subject
;
but
with
all
my
sense
of
its
being
cruel
and
inhuman
,
I
could
*NL*
never
find
in
my
heart
to
make
any
restitution
.
The
reflection
wore
*NL*
off
,
and
I
began
quickly
to
forget
the
circumstances
that
attended
the
*NL*
taking
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nor
was
this
all
;
for
though
by
this
job
I
was
become
considerably
*NL*
richer
than
before
,
yet
the
resolution
I
had
formerly
taken
,
of
leaving
*NL*
off
this
horrid
trade
when
I
had
gotten
a
little
more
,
did
not
return
,
*NL*
but
I
must
still
get
farther
,
and
more
;
and
the
avarice
joined
so
with
*NL*
the
success
,
that
I
had
no
more
thought
of
coming
to
a
timely
*NL*
alteration
of
life
,
though
without
it
I
could
expect
no
safety
,
no
*NL*
tranquillity
in
the
possession
of
what
I
had
so
wickedly
gained
;
but
a
*NL*
little
more
,
and
a
little
more
,
was
the
case
still
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
,
yielding
to
the
importunities
of
my
crime
,
I
cast
off
all
*NL*
remorse
and
repentance
,
and
all
the
reflections
on
that
head
turned
to
*NL*
no
more
than
this
,
that
I
might
perhaps
come
to
have
one
booty
more
*NL*
that
might
complete
my
desires
;
but
though
I
certainly
had
that
one
*NL*
booty
,
yet
every
hit
looked
towards
another
,
and
was
so
encouraging
to
*NL*
me
to
go
on
with
the
trade
,
that
I
had
no
gust
to
the
thought
of
laying
*NL*
it
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
condition
,
hardened
by
success
,
and
resolving
to
go
on
,
I
fell
*NL*
into
the
snare
in
which
I
was
appointed
to
meet
with
my
last
reward
for
*NL*
this
kind
of
life
.
But
even
this
was
not
yet
,
for
I
met
with
several
*NL*
successful
adventures
more
in
this
way
of
being
undone
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
remained
still
with
my
governess
,
who
was
for
a
while
really
*NL*
concerned
for
the
misfortune
of
my
comrade
that
had
been
hanged
,
and
*NL*
who
,
it
seems
,
knew
enough
of
my
governess
to
have
sent
her
the
same
*NL*
way
,
and
which
made
her
very
uneasy
;
indeed
,
she
was
in
a
very
great
*NL*
fright
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
true
that
when
she
was
gone
,
and
had
not
opened
mouth
to
tell
*NL*
what
she
knew
,
my
governess
was
easy
as
to
that
point
,
and
perhaps
glad
*NL*
she
was
hanged
,
for
it
was
in
her
power
to
have
obtained
a
pardon
at
*NL*
the
expense
of
her
friends
;
but
on
the
other
hand
,
the
loss
of
her
,
and
*NL*
the
sense
of
her
kindness
in
not
making
her
market
of
what
she
knew
,
*NL*
moved
my
governess
to
mourn
very
sincerely
for
her
.
I
comforted
her
as
*NL*
well
as
I
could
,
and
she
in
return
hardened
me
to
merit
more
completely
*NL*
the
same
fate
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
as
I
have
said
,
it
made
me
the
more
wary
,
and
particularly
I
*NL*
was
very
shy
of
shoplifting
,
especially
among
the
mercers
and
drapers
,
*NL*
who
are
a
set
of
fellows
that
have
their
eyes
very
much
about
them
.
I
*NL*
made
a
venture
or
two
among
the
lace
folks
and
the
milliners
,
and
*NL*
particularly
at
one
shop
where
I
got
notice
of
two
young
women
who
were
*NL*
newly
set
up
,
and
had
not
been
bred
to
the
trade
.
There
I
think
I
*NL*
carried
off
a
piece
of
bone-lace
,
worth
six
or
seven
pounds
,
and
a
*NL*
paper
of
thread
.
But
this
was
but
once
;
it
was
a
trick
that
would
not
*NL*
serve
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
always
reckoned
a
safe
job
when
we
heard
of
a
new
shop
,
and
*NL*
especially
when
the
people
were
such
as
were
not
bred
to
shops
.
Such
*NL*
may
depend
upon
it
that
they
will
be
visited
once
or
twice
at
their
*NL*
beginning
,
and
they
must
be
very
sharp
indeed
if
they
can
prevent
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
made
another
adventure
or
two
,
but
they
were
but
trifles
too
,
though
*NL*
sufficient
to
live
on
.
After
this
nothing
considerable
offering
for
a
*NL*
good
while
,
I
began
to
think
that
I
must
give
over
the
trade
in
*NL*
earnest
;
but
my
governess
,
who
was
not
willing
to
lose
me
,
and
expected
*NL*
great
things
of
me
,
brought
me
one
day
into
company
with
a
young
woman
*NL*
and
a
fellow
that
went
for
her
husband
,
though
as
it
appeared
*NL*
afterwards
,
she
was
not
his
wife
,
but
they
were
partners
,
it
seems
,
in
*NL*
the
trade
they
carried
on
,
and
partners
in
something
else
.
In
short
,
*NL*
they
robbed
together
,
lay
together
,
were
taken
together
,
and
at
last
*NL*
were
hanged
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
came
into
a
kind
of
league
with
these
two
by
the
help
of
my
*NL*
governess
,
and
they
carried
me
out
into
three
or
four
adventures
,
where
*NL*
I
rather
saw
them
commit
some
coarse
and
unhandy
robberies
,
in
which
*NL*
nothing
but
a
great
stock
of
impudence
on
their
side
,
and
gross
*NL*
negligence
on
the
people
's
side
who
were
robbed
,
could
have
made
them
*NL*
successful
.
So
I
resolved
from
that
time
forward
to
be
very
cautious
*NL*
how
I
adventured
upon
anything
with
them
;
and
indeed
,
when
two
or
three
*NL*
unlucky
projects
were
proposed
by
them
,
I
declined
the
offer
,
and
*NL*
persuaded
them
against
it
.
One
time
they
particularly
proposed
robbing
*NL*
a
watchmaker
of
three
gold
watches
,
which
they
had
eyed
in
the
daytime
,
*NL*
and
found
the
place
where
he
laid
them
.
One
of
them
had
so
many
keys
*NL*
of
all
kinds
,
that
he
made
no
question
to
open
the
place
where
the
*NL*
watchmaker
had
laid
them
;
and
so
we
made
a
kind
of
an
appointment
;
but
*NL*
when
I
came
to
look
narrowly
into
the
thing
,
I
found
they
proposed
*NL*
breaking
open
the
house
,
and
this
,
as
a
thing
out
of
my
way
,
I
would
*NL*
not
embark
in
,
so
they
went
without
me
.
They
did
get
into
the
house
by
*NL*
main
force
,
and
broke
up
the
locked
place
where
the
watches
were
,
but
*NL*
found
but
one
of
the
gold
watches
,
and
a
silver
one
,
which
they
took
,
*NL*
and
got
out
of
the
house
again
very
clear
.
But
the
family
,
being
*NL*
alarmed
,
cried
out
`
Thieves
,
'
and
the
man
was
pursued
and
taken
;
the
*NL*
young
woman
had
got
off
too
,
but
unhappily
was
stopped
at
a
distance
,
*NL*
and
the
watches
found
upon
her
.
And
thus
I
had
a
second
escape
,
for
*NL*
they
were
convicted
,
and
both
hanged
,
being
old
offenders
,
though
but
*NL*
young
people
.
As
I
said
before
that
they
robbed
together
and
lay
*NL*
together
,
so
now
they
hanged
together
,
and
there
ended
my
new
*NL*
partnership
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
began
now
to
be
very
wary
,
having
so
narrowly
escaped
a
scouring
,
and
*NL*
having
such
an
example
before
me
;
but
I
had
a
new
tempter
,
who
prompted
*NL*
me
every
day
--
I
mean
my
governess
;
and
now
a
prize
presented
,
which
as
*NL*
it
came
by
her
management
,
so
she
expected
a
good
share
of
the
booty
.
*NL*
There
was
a
good
quantity
of
Flanders
lace
lodged
in
a
private
house
,
*NL*
where
she
had
gotten
intelligence
of
it
,
and
Flanders
lace
being
*NL*
prohibited
,
it
was
a
good
booty
to
any
custom-house
officer
that
could
*NL*
come
at
it
.
I
had
a
full
account
from
my
governess
,
as
well
of
the
*NL*
quantity
as
of
the
very
place
where
it
was
concealed
,
and
I
went
to
a
*NL*
custom-house
officer
,
and
told
him
I
had
such
a
discovery
to
make
to
*NL*
him
of
such
a
quantity
of
lace
,
if
he
would
assure
me
that
I
should
*NL*
have
my
due
share
of
the
reward
.
This
was
so
just
an
offer
,
that
*NL*
nothing
could
be
fairer
;
so
he
agreed
,
and
taking
a
constable
and
me
*NL*
with
him
,
we
beset
the
house
.
As
I
told
him
I
could
go
directly
to
the
*NL*
place
,
he
left
it
to
me
;
and
the
hole
being
very
dark
,
I
squeezed
*NL*
myself
into
it
,
with
a
candle
in
my
hand
,
and
so
reached
the
pieces
out
*NL*
to
him
,
taking
care
as
I
gave
him
some
so
to
secure
as
much
about
*NL*
myself
as
I
could
conveniently
dispose
of
.
There
was
near
#
300
worth
*NL*
of
lace
in
the
hole
,
and
I
secured
about
#
50
worth
of
it
to
myself
.
*NL*
The
people
of
the
house
were
not
owners
of
the
lace
,
but
a
merchant
who
*NL*
had
entrusted
them
with
it
;
so
that
they
were
not
so
surprised
as
I
*NL*
thought
they
would
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
left
the
officer
overjoyed
with
his
prize
,
and
fully
satisfied
with
*NL*
what
he
had
got
,
and
appointed
to
meet
him
at
a
house
of
his
own
*NL*
directing
,
where
I
came
after
I
had
disposed
of
the
cargo
I
had
about
*NL*
me
,
of
which
he
had
not
the
least
suspicion
.
When
I
came
to
him
he
*NL*
began
to
capitulate
with
me
,
believing
I
did
not
understand
the
right
I
*NL*
had
to
a
share
in
the
prize
,
and
would
fain
have
put
me
off
with
#
20
,
*NL*
but
I
let
him
know
that
I
was
not
so
ignorant
as
he
supposed
I
was
;
and
*NL*
yet
I
was
glad
,
too
,
that
he
offered
to
bring
me
to
a
certainty
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
asked
#
100
,
and
he
rose
up
to
#
30
;
I
fell
to
#
80
,
and
he
rose
again
*NL*
to
#
40
;
in
a
word
,
he
offered
#
50
,
and
I
consented
,
only
demanding
a
*NL*
piece
of
lace
,
which
I
though
came
to
about
#
8
or
#
9
,
as
if
it
had
been
*NL*
for
my
own
wear
,
and
he
agreed
to
it
.
So
I
got
#
50
in
money
paid
me
*NL*
that
same
night
,
and
made
an
end
of
the
bargain
;
nor
did
he
ever
know
*NL*
who
I
was
,
or
where
to
inquire
for
me
,
so
that
if
it
had
been
*NL*
discovered
that
part
of
the
goods
were
embezzled
,
he
could
have
made
no
*NL*
challenge
upon
me
for
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
very
punctually
divided
this
spoil
with
my
governess
,
and
I
passed
*NL*
with
her
from
this
time
for
a
very
dexterous
manager
in
the
nicest
*NL*
cases
.
I
found
that
this
last
was
the
best
and
easiest
sort
of
work
*NL*
that
was
in
my
way
,
and
I
made
it
my
business
to
inquire
out
prohibited
*NL*
goods
,
and
after
buying
some
,
usually
betrayed
them
,
but
none
of
these
*NL*
discoveries
amounted
to
anything
considerable
,
not
like
that
I
related
*NL*
just
now
;
but
I
was
willing
to
act
safe
,
and
was
still
cautious
of
*NL*
running
the
great
risks
which
I
found
others
did
,
and
in
which
they
*NL*
miscarried
every
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
thing
of
moment
was
an
attempt
at
a
gentlewoman
's
good
watch
.
*NL*
It
happened
in
a
crowd
,
at
a
meeting-house
,
where
I
was
in
very
great
*NL*
danger
of
being
taken
.
I
had
full
hold
of
her
watch
,
but
giving
a
*NL*
great
jostle
,
as
if
somebody
had
thrust
me
against
her
,
and
in
the
*NL*
juncture
giving
the
watch
a
fair
pull
,
I
found
it
would
not
come
,
so
I
*NL*
let
it
go
that
moment
,
and
cried
out
as
if
I
had
been
killed
,
that
*NL*
somebody
had
trod
upon
my
foot
,
and
that
there
were
certainly
*NL*
pickpockets
there
,
for
somebody
or
other
had
given
a
pull
at
my
watch
;
*NL*
for
you
are
to
observe
that
on
these
adventures
we
always
went
very
*NL*
well
dressed
,
and
I
had
very
good
clothes
on
,
and
a
gold
watch
by
my
*NL*
side
,
as
like
a
lady
as
other
fold
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
no
sooner
said
so
,
but
the
other
gentlewoman
cried
out
'
A
*NL*
pickpocket
'
too
,
for
somebody
,
she
said
,
had
tried
to
pull
her
watch
*NL*
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
touched
her
watch
I
was
close
to
her
,
but
when
I
cried
out
I
*NL*
stopped
as
it
were
short
,
and
the
crowd
bearing
her
forward
a
little
,
*NL*
she
made
a
noise
too
,
but
it
was
at
some
distance
from
me
,
so
that
she
*NL*
did
not
in
the
least
suspect
me
;
but
when
she
cried
out
'
A
pickpocket
,
'
*NL*
somebody
cried
,
`
Ay
,
and
here
has
been
another
!
this
gentlewoman
has
*NL*
been
attempted
too
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
very
instance
,
a
little
farther
in
the
crowd
,
and
very
luckily
*NL*
too
,
they
cried
out
'
A
pickpocket
,
'
again
,
and
really
seized
a
young
*NL*
fellow
in
the
very
act
.
This
,
though
unhappy
for
the
wretch
,
was
very
*NL*
opportunely
for
my
case
,
though
I
had
carried
it
off
handsomely
enough
*NL*
before
;
but
now
it
was
out
of
doubt
,
and
all
the
loose
part
of
the
*NL*
crowd
ran
that
way
,
and
the
poor
boy
was
delivered
up
to
the
rage
of
*NL*
the
street
,
which
is
a
cruelty
I
need
not
describe
,
and
which
,
however
,
*NL*
they
are
always
glad
of
,
rather
than
to
be
sent
to
Newgate
,
where
they
*NL*
lie
often
a
long
time
,
till
they
are
almost
perished
,
and
sometimes
*NL*
they
are
hanged
,
and
the
best
they
can
look
for
,
if
they
are
convicted
,
*NL*
is
to
be
transported
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
a
narrow
escape
to
me
,
and
I
was
so
frighted
that
I
ventured
*NL*
no
more
at
gold
watches
a
great
while
.
There
was
indeed
a
great
many
*NL*
concurring
circumstances
in
this
adventure
which
assisted
to
my
escape
;
*NL*
but
the
chief
was
,
that
the
woman
whose
watch
I
had
pulled
at
was
a
*NL*
fool
;
that
is
to
say
,
she
was
ignorant
of
the
nature
of
the
attempt
,
*NL*
which
one
would
have
thought
she
should
not
have
been
,
seeing
she
was
*NL*
wise
enough
to
fasten
her
watch
so
that
it
could
not
be
slipped
up
.
*NL*
But
she
was
in
such
a
fright
that
she
had
no
thought
about
her
proper
*NL*
for
the
discovery
;
for
she
,
when
she
felt
the
pull
,
screamed
out
,
and
*NL*
pushed
herself
forward
,
and
put
all
the
people
about
her
into
disorder
,
*NL*
but
said
not
a
word
of
her
watch
,
or
of
a
pickpocket
,
for
a
least
two
*NL*
minutes
'
time
,
which
was
time
enough
for
me
,
and
to
spare
.
For
as
I
*NL*
had
cried
out
behind
her
,
as
I
have
said
,
and
bore
myself
back
in
the
*NL*
crowd
as
she
bore
forward
,
there
were
several
people
,
at
least
seven
or
*NL*
eight
,
the
throng
being
still
moving
on
,
that
were
got
between
me
and
*NL*
her
in
that
time
,
and
then
I
crying
out
'
A
pickpocket
,
'
rather
sooner
*NL*
than
she
,
or
at
least
as
soon
,
she
might
as
well
be
the
person
*NL*
suspected
as
I
,
and
the
people
were
confused
in
their
inquiry
;
whereas
,
*NL*
had
she
with
a
presence
of
mind
needful
on
such
an
occasion
,
as
soon
as
*NL*
she
felt
the
pull
,
not
screamed
out
as
she
did
,
but
turned
immediately
*NL*
round
and
seized
the
next
body
that
was
behind
her
,
she
had
infallibly
*NL*
taken
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
is
a
direction
not
of
the
kindest
sort
to
the
fraternity
,
but
't
is
*NL*
certainly
a
key
to
the
clue
of
a
pickpocket
's
motions
,
and
whoever
can
*NL*
follow
it
will
as
certainly
catch
the
thief
as
he
will
be
sure
to
miss
*NL*
if
he
does
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
another
adventure
,
which
puts
this
matter
out
of
doubt
,
and
which
*NL*
may
be
an
instruction
for
posterity
in
the
case
of
a
pickpocket
.
My
*NL*
good
old
governess
,
to
give
a
short
touch
at
her
history
,
though
she
*NL*
had
left
off
the
trade
,
was
,
as
I
may
say
,
born
a
pickpocket
,
and
,
as
I
*NL*
understood
afterwards
,
had
run
through
all
the
several
degrees
of
that
*NL*
art
,
and
yet
had
never
been
taken
but
once
,
when
she
was
so
grossly
*NL*
detected
,
that
she
was
convicted
and
ordered
to
be
transported
;
but
*NL*
being
a
woman
of
a
rare
tongue
,
and
withal
having
money
in
her
pocket
,
*NL*
she
found
means
,
the
ship
putting
into
Ireland
for
provisions
,
to
get
*NL*
on
shore
there
,
where
she
lived
and
practised
her
old
trade
for
some
*NL*
years
;
when
falling
into
another
sort
of
bad
company
,
she
turned
*NL*
midwife
and
procuress
,
and
played
a
hundred
pranks
there
,
which
she
*NL*
gave
me
a
little
history
of
in
confidence
between
us
as
we
grew
more
*NL*
intimate
;
and
it
was
to
this
wicked
creature
that
I
owed
all
the
art
*NL*
and
dexterity
I
arrived
to
,
in
which
there
were
few
that
ever
went
*NL*
beyond
me
,
or
that
practised
so
long
without
any
misfortune
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
after
those
adventures
in
Ireland
,
and
when
she
was
pretty
well
*NL*
known
in
that
country
,
that
she
left
Dublin
and
came
over
to
England
,
*NL*
where
,
the
time
of
her
transportation
being
not
expired
,
she
left
her
*NL*
former
trade
,
for
fear
of
falling
into
bad
hands
again
,
for
then
she
*NL*
was
sure
to
have
gone
to
wreck
.
Here
she
set
up
the
same
trade
she
had
*NL*
followed
in
Ireland
,
in
which
she
soon
,
by
her
admirable
management
and
*NL*
good
tongue
,
arrived
to
the
height
which
I
have
already
described
,
and
*NL*
indeed
began
to
be
rich
,
though
her
trade
fell
off
again
afterwards
,
as
*NL*
I
have
hinted
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
mentioned
thus
much
of
the
history
of
this
woman
here
,
the
better
to
*NL*
account
for
the
concern
she
had
in
the
wicked
life
I
was
now
leading
,
*NL*
into
all
the
particulars
of
which
she
led
me
,
as
it
were
,
by
the
hand
,
*NL*
and
gave
me
such
directions
,
and
I
so
well
followed
them
,
that
I
grew
*NL*
the
greatest
artist
of
my
time
and
worked
myself
out
of
every
danger
*NL*
with
such
dexterity
,
that
when
several
more
of
my
comrades
ran
*NL*
themselves
into
Newgate
presently
,
and
by
that
time
they
had
been
half
*NL*
a
year
at
the
trade
,
I
had
now
practised
upwards
of
five
years
,
and
the
*NL*
people
at
Newgate
did
not
so
much
as
know
me
;
they
had
heard
much
of
me
*NL*
indeed
,
and
often
expected
me
there
,
but
I
always
got
off
,
though
many
*NL*
times
in
the
extremest
danger
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
the
greatest
dangers
I
was
now
in
,
was
that
I
was
too
well
known
*NL*
among
the
trade
,
and
some
of
them
,
whose
hatred
was
owing
rather
to
*NL*
envy
than
any
injury
I
had
done
them
,
began
to
be
angry
that
I
should
*NL*
always
escape
when
they
were
always
catched
and
hurried
to
Newgate
.
*NL*
These
were
they
that
gave
me
the
name
of
Moll
Flanders
;
for
it
was
no
*NL*
more
of
affinity
with
my
real
name
or
with
any
of
the
name
I
had
ever
*NL*
gone
by
,
than
black
is
of
kin
to
white
,
except
that
once
,
as
before
,
I
*NL*
called
myself
Mrs.
Flanders
;
when
I
sheltered
myself
in
the
Mint
;
but
*NL*
that
these
rogues
never
knew
,
nor
could
I
ever
learn
how
they
came
to
*NL*
give
me
the
name
,
or
what
the
occasion
of
it
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
soon
informed
that
some
of
these
who
were
gotten
fast
into
*NL*
Newgate
had
vowed
to
impeach
me
;
and
as
I
knew
that
two
or
three
of
*NL*
them
were
but
too
able
to
do
it
,
I
was
under
a
great
concern
about
it
,
*NL*
and
kept
within
doors
for
a
good
while
.
But
my
governess
--
whom
I
*NL*
always
made
partner
in
my
success
,
and
who
now
played
a
sure
game
with
*NL*
me
,
for
that
she
had
a
share
of
the
gain
and
no
share
in
the
hazard
--
I
*NL*
say
,
my
governess
was
something
impatient
of
my
leading
such
a
useless
,
*NL*
unprofitable
life
,
as
she
called
it
;
and
she
laid
a
new
contrivance
for
*NL*
my
going
abroad
,
and
this
was
to
dress
me
up
in
men
's
clothes
,
and
so
*NL*
put
me
into
a
new
kind
of
practice
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
tall
and
personable
,
but
a
little
too
smooth-faced
for
a
man
;
*NL*
however
,
I
seldom
went
abroad
but
in
the
night
,
it
did
well
enough
;
but
*NL*
it
was
a
long
time
before
I
could
behave
in
my
new
clothes
--
I
mean
,
as
*NL*
to
my
craft
.
It
was
impossible
to
be
so
nimble
,
so
ready
,
so
dexterous
*NL*
at
these
things
in
a
dress
so
contrary
to
nature
;
and
I
did
everything
*NL*
clumsily
,
so
I
had
neither
the
success
nor
the
easiness
of
escape
that
*NL*
I
had
before
,
and
I
resolved
to
leave
it
off
;
but
that
resolution
was
*NL*
confirmed
soon
after
by
the
following
accident
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
my
governess
disguised
me
like
a
man
,
so
she
joined
me
with
a
man
,
a
*NL*
young
fellow
that
was
nimble
enough
at
his
business
,
and
for
about
*NL*
three
weeks
we
did
very
well
together
.
Our
principal
trade
was
*NL*
watching
shopkeepers
'
counters
,
and
slipping
off
any
kind
of
goods
we
*NL*
could
see
carelessly
laid
anywhere
,
and
we
made
several
good
bargains
,
*NL*
as
we
called
them
,
at
this
work
.
And
as
we
kept
always
together
,
so
we
*NL*
grew
very
intimate
,
yet
he
never
knew
that
I
was
not
a
man
,
nay
,
though
*NL*
I
several
times
went
home
with
him
to
his
lodgings
,
according
as
our
*NL*
business
directed
,
and
four
or
five
times
lay
with
him
all
night
.
But
*NL*
our
design
lay
another
way
,
and
it
was
absolutely
necessary
to
me
to
*NL*
conceal
my
sex
from
him
,
as
appeared
afterwards
.
The
circumstances
of
*NL*
our
living
,
coming
in
late
,
and
having
such
and
such
business
to
do
as
*NL*
required
that
nobody
should
be
trusted
with
the
coming
into
our
*NL*
lodgings
,
were
such
as
made
it
impossible
to
me
to
refuse
lying
with
*NL*
him
,
unless
I
would
have
owned
my
sex
;
and
as
it
was
,
I
effectually
*NL*
concealed
myself
.
But
his
ill
,
and
my
good
fortune
,
soon
put
an
end
to
*NL*
this
life
,
which
I
must
own
I
was
sick
of
too
,
on
several
other
*NL*
accounts
.
We
had
made
several
prizes
in
this
new
way
of
business
,
but
*NL*
the
last
would
be
extraordinary
.
There
was
a
shop
in
a
certain
street
*NL*
which
had
a
warehouse
behind
it
that
looked
into
another
street
,
the
*NL*
house
making
the
corner
of
the
turning
.
*NL*
*NL*
Through
the
window
of
the
warehouse
we
saw
,
lying
on
the
counter
or
*NL*
showboard
,
which
was
just
before
it
,
five
pieces
of
silks
,
besides
*NL*
other
stuffs
,
and
though
it
was
almost
dark
,
yet
the
people
,
being
busy
*NL*
in
the
fore-shop
with
customers
,
had
not
had
time
to
shut
up
those
*NL*
windows
,
or
else
had
forgot
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
the
young
fellow
was
so
overjoyed
with
,
that
he
could
not
restrain
*NL*
himself
.
It
lay
all
within
his
reach
he
said
,
and
he
swore
violently
*NL*
to
me
that
he
would
have
it
,
if
he
broke
down
the
house
for
it
.
I
*NL*
dissuaded
him
a
little
,
but
saw
there
was
no
remedy
;
so
he
ran
rashly
*NL*
upon
it
,
slipped
out
a
square
of
the
sash
window
dexterously
enough
,
*NL*
and
without
noise
,
and
got
out
four
pieces
of
the
silks
,
and
came
with
*NL*
them
towards
me
,
but
was
immediately
pursued
with
a
terrible
clutter
*NL*
and
noise
.
We
were
standing
together
indeed
,
but
I
had
not
taken
any
*NL*
of
the
goods
out
of
his
hand
,
when
I
said
to
him
hastily
,
`
You
are
*NL*
undone
,
fly
,
for
God
's
sake
!
'
He
ran
like
lightning
,
and
I
too
,
but
*NL*
the
pursuit
was
hotter
after
him
because
he
had
the
goods
,
than
after
*NL*
me
.
He
dropped
two
of
the
pieces
,
which
stopped
them
a
little
,
but
the
*NL*
crowd
increased
and
pursued
us
both
.
They
took
him
soon
after
with
the
*NL*
other
two
pieces
upon
him
,
and
then
the
rest
followed
me
.
I
ran
for
it
*NL*
and
got
into
my
governess
's
house
whither
some
quick-eyed
people
*NL*
followed
me
to
warmly
as
to
fix
me
there
.
They
did
not
immediately
*NL*
knock
,
at
the
door
,
by
which
I
got
time
to
throw
off
my
disguise
and
*NL*
dress
me
in
my
own
clothes
;
besides
,
when
they
came
there
,
my
*NL*
governess
,
who
had
her
tale
ready
,
kept
her
door
shut
,
and
called
out
*NL*
to
them
and
told
them
there
was
no
man
come
in
there
.
The
people
*NL*
affirmed
there
did
a
man
come
in
there
,
and
swore
they
would
break
open
*NL*
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
governess
,
not
at
all
surprised
,
spoke
calmly
to
them
,
told
them
*NL*
they
should
very
freely
come
and
search
her
house
,
if
they
should
bring
*NL*
a
constable
,
and
let
in
none
but
such
as
the
constable
would
admit
,
for
*NL*
it
was
unreasonable
to
let
in
a
whole
crowd
.
This
they
could
not
*NL*
refuse
,
though
they
were
a
crowd
.
So
a
constable
was
fetched
*NL*
immediately
,
and
she
very
freely
opened
the
door
;
the
constable
kept
*NL*
the
door
,
and
the
men
he
appointed
searched
the
house
,
my
governess
*NL*
going
with
them
from
room
to
room
.
When
she
came
to
my
room
she
called
*NL*
to
me
,
and
said
aloud
,
`
Cousin
,
pray
open
the
door
;
here
's
some
*NL*
gentlemen
that
must
come
and
look
into
your
room
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
a
little
girl
with
me
,
which
was
my
governess
's
grandchild
,
as
*NL*
she
called
her
;
and
I
bade
her
open
the
door
,
and
there
sat
I
at
work
*NL*
with
a
great
litter
of
things
about
me
,
as
if
I
had
been
at
work
all
*NL*
day
,
being
myself
quite
undressed
,
with
only
night-clothes
on
my
head
,
*NL*
and
a
loose
morning-gown
wrapped
about
me
.
My
governess
made
a
kind
of
*NL*
excuse
for
their
disturbing
me
,
telling
me
partly
the
occasion
of
it
,
*NL*
and
that
she
had
no
remedy
but
to
open
the
doors
to
them
,
and
let
them
*NL*
satisfy
themselves
,
for
all
she
could
say
to
them
would
not
satisfy
*NL*
them
.
I
sat
still
,
and
bid
them
search
the
room
if
they
pleased
,
for
*NL*
if
there
was
anybody
in
the
house
,
I
was
sure
they
were
not
in
my
room
;
*NL*
and
as
for
the
rest
of
the
house
,
I
had
nothing
to
say
to
that
,
I
did
*NL*
not
understand
what
they
looked
for
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everything
looked
so
innocent
and
to
honest
about
me
,
that
they
treated
*NL*
me
civiller
than
I
expected
,
but
it
was
not
till
they
had
searched
the
*NL*
room
to
a
nicety
,
even
under
the
bed
,
in
the
bed
,
and
everywhere
else
*NL*
where
it
was
possible
anything
could
be
hid
.
When
they
had
done
this
,
*NL*
and
could
find
nothing
,
they
asked
my
pardon
for
troubling
me
,
and
went
*NL*
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
had
thus
searched
the
house
from
bottom
to
top
,
and
then
top
*NL*
to
bottom
,
and
could
find
nothing
,
they
appeased
the
mob
pretty
well
;
*NL*
but
they
carried
my
governess
before
the
justice
.
Two
men
swore
that
*NL*
they
saw
the
man
whom
they
pursued
go
into
her
house
.
My
governess
*NL*
rattled
and
made
a
great
noise
that
her
house
should
be
insulted
,
and
*NL*
that
she
should
be
used
thus
for
nothing
;
that
if
a
man
did
come
in
,
he
*NL*
might
go
out
again
presently
for
aught
she
knew
,
for
she
was
ready
to
*NL*
make
oath
that
no
man
had
been
within
her
doors
all
that
day
as
she
*NL*
knew
of
-LRB-
and
that
was
very
true
indeed
-RRB-
;
that
is
might
be
indeed
that
*NL*
as
she
was
abovestairs
,
any
fellow
in
a
fright
might
find
the
door
open
*NL*
and
run
in
for
shelter
when
he
was
pursued
,
but
that
she
knew
nothing
*NL*
of
it
;
and
if
it
had
been
so
,
he
certainly
went
out
again
,
perhaps
at
*NL*
the
other
door
,
for
she
had
another
door
into
an
alley
,
and
so
had
made
*NL*
his
escape
and
cheated
them
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
indeed
probable
enough
,
and
the
justice
satisfied
himself
with
*NL*
giving
her
an
oath
that
she
had
not
received
or
admitted
any
man
into
*NL*
her
house
to
conceal
him
,
or
protect
or
hide
him
from
justice
.
This
*NL*
oath
she
might
justly
take
,
and
did
so
,
and
so
she
was
dismissed
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
easy
to
judge
what
a
fright
I
was
in
upon
this
occasion
,
and
it
*NL*
was
impossible
for
my
governess
ever
to
bring
me
to
dress
in
that
*NL*
disguise
again
;
for
,
as
I
told
her
,
I
should
certainly
betray
myself
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
poor
partner
in
this
mischief
was
now
in
a
bad
case
,
for
he
was
*NL*
carried
away
before
my
Lord
Mayor
,
and
by
his
worship
committed
to
*NL*
Newgate
,
and
the
people
that
took
him
were
so
willing
,
as
well
as
able
,
*NL*
to
prosecute
him
,
that
they
offered
themselves
to
enter
into
*NL*
recognisances
to
appear
at
the
sessions
and
pursue
the
charge
against
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
he
got
his
indictment
deferred
,
upon
promise
to
discover
his
*NL*
accomplices
,
and
particularly
the
man
that
was
concerned
with
him
in
*NL*
his
robbery
;
and
he
failed
not
to
do
his
endeavour
,
for
he
gave
in
my
*NL*
name
,
whom
he
called
Gabriel
Spencer
,
which
was
the
name
I
went
by
to
*NL*
him
;
and
here
appeared
the
wisdom
of
my
concealing
my
name
and
sex
from
*NL*
him
,
which
,
if
he
had
ever
known
I
had
been
undone
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
all
he
could
to
discover
this
Gabriel
Spencer
;
he
described
me
,
*NL*
he
discovered
the
place
where
he
said
I
lodged
,
and
,
in
a
word
,
all
the
*NL*
particulars
that
he
could
of
my
dwelling
;
but
having
concealed
the
main
*NL*
circumstances
of
my
sex
from
him
,
I
had
a
vast
advantage
,
and
he
never
*NL*
could
hear
of
me
.
He
brought
two
or
three
families
into
trouble
by
his
*NL*
endeavouring
to
find
me
out
,
but
they
knew
nothing
of
me
,
any
more
than
*NL*
that
I
had
a
fellow
with
me
that
they
had
seen
,
but
knew
nothing
of
.
*NL*
And
as
for
my
governess
,
though
she
was
the
means
of
his
coming
to
me
,
*NL*
yet
it
was
done
at
second-hand
,
and
he
knew
nothing
of
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
turned
to
his
disadvantage
;
for
having
promised
discoveries
,
but
*NL*
not
being
able
to
make
it
good
,
it
was
looked
upon
as
trifling
with
the
*NL*
justice
of
the
city
,
and
he
was
the
more
fiercely
pursued
by
the
*NL*
shopkeepers
who
took
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
,
however
,
terribly
uneasy
all
this
while
,
and
that
I
might
be
*NL*
quite
out
of
the
way
,
I
went
away
from
my
governess
's
for
a
while
;
but
*NL*
not
knowing
wither
to
wander
,
I
took
a
maid-servant
with
me
,
and
took
*NL*
the
stage-coach
to
Dunstable
,
to
my
old
landlord
and
landlady
,
where
I
*NL*
had
lived
so
handsomely
with
my
Lancashire
husband
.
Here
I
told
her
a
*NL*
formal
story
,
that
I
expected
my
husband
every
day
from
Ireland
,
and
*NL*
that
I
had
sent
a
letter
to
him
that
I
would
meet
him
at
Dunstable
at
*NL*
her
house
,
and
that
he
would
certainly
land
,
if
the
wind
was
fair
,
in
a
*NL*
few
days
,
so
that
I
was
come
to
spend
a
few
days
with
them
till
he
*NL*
should
come
,
for
he
was
either
come
post
,
or
in
the
West
Chester
coach
,
*NL*
I
knew
not
which
;
but
whichsoever
it
was
,
he
would
be
sure
to
come
to
*NL*
that
house
to
meet
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
landlady
was
mighty
glad
to
see
me
,
and
my
landlord
made
such
a
stir
*NL*
with
me
,
that
if
I
had
been
a
princess
I
could
not
have
been
better
*NL*
used
,
and
here
I
might
have
been
welcome
a
month
or
two
if
I
had
*NL*
thought
fit
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
my
business
was
of
another
nature
.
I
was
very
uneasy
-LRB-
though
so
*NL*
well
disguised
that
it
was
scarce
possible
to
detect
me
-RRB-
lest
this
*NL*
fellow
should
somehow
or
other
find
me
out
;
and
though
he
could
not
*NL*
charge
me
with
this
robbery
,
having
persuaded
him
not
to
venture
,
and
*NL*
having
also
done
nothing
in
it
myself
but
run
away
,
yet
he
might
have
*NL*
charged
me
with
other
things
,
and
have
bought
his
own
life
at
the
*NL*
expense
of
mine
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
filled
me
with
horrible
apprehensions
.
I
had
no
recourse
,
no
*NL*
friend
,
no
confidante
but
my
old
governess
,
and
I
knew
no
remedy
but
to
*NL*
put
my
life
in
her
hands
,
and
so
I
did
,
for
I
let
her
know
where
to
*NL*
send
to
me
,
and
had
several
letters
from
her
while
I
stayed
here
.
Some
*NL*
of
them
almost
scared
me
out
my
wits
but
at
last
she
sent
me
the
joyful
*NL*
news
that
he
was
hanged
,
which
was
the
best
news
to
me
that
I
had
heard
*NL*
a
great
while
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
stayed
here
five
weeks
,
and
lived
very
comfortably
indeed
-LRB-
the
*NL*
secret
anxiety
of
my
mind
excepted
-RRB-
;
but
when
I
received
this
letter
I
*NL*
looked
pleasantly
again
,
and
told
my
landlady
that
I
had
received
a
*NL*
letter
from
my
spouse
in
Ireland
,
that
I
had
the
good
news
of
his
being
*NL*
very
well
,
but
had
the
bad
news
that
his
business
would
not
permit
him
*NL*
to
come
away
so
soon
as
he
expected
,
and
so
I
was
like
to
go
back
again
*NL*
without
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
landlady
complimented
me
upon
the
good
news
however
,
that
I
had
*NL*
heard
he
was
well
.
`
For
I
have
observed
,
madam
,
'
says
she
,
`
you
had
n't
*NL*
been
so
pleasant
as
you
used
to
be
;
you
have
been
over
head
and
ears
in
*NL*
care
for
him
,
I
dare
say
,
'
says
the
good
woman
;
''
tis
easy
to
be
seen
*NL*
there
's
an
alteration
in
you
for
the
better
,
'
says
she
.
`
Well
,
I
am
*NL*
sorry
the
esquire
ca
n't
come
yet
,
'
says
my
landlord
;
'
I
should
have
*NL*
been
heartily
glad
to
have
seen
him
.
But
I
hope
,
when
you
have
certain
*NL*
news
of
his
coming
,
you
'll
take
a
step
hither
again
,
madam
,
'
says
he
;
*NL*
`
you
shall
be
very
welcome
whenever
you
please
to
come
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
With
all
these
fine
compliments
we
parted
,
and
I
came
merry
enough
to
*NL*
London
,
and
found
my
governess
as
well
pleased
as
I
was
.
And
now
she
*NL*
told
me
she
would
never
recommend
any
partner
to
me
again
,
for
she
*NL*
always
found
,
she
said
,
that
I
had
the
best
luck
when
I
ventured
by
*NL*
myself
.
And
so
indeed
I
had
,
for
I
was
seldom
in
any
danger
when
I
was
*NL*
by
myself
,
or
if
I
was
,
I
got
out
of
it
with
more
dexterity
than
when
I
*NL*
was
entangled
with
the
dull
measures
of
other
people
,
who
had
perhaps
*NL*
less
forecast
,
and
were
more
rash
and
impatient
than
I
;
for
though
I
*NL*
had
as
much
courage
to
venture
as
any
of
them
,
yet
I
used
more
caution
*NL*
before
I
undertook
a
thing
,
and
had
more
presence
of
mind
when
I
was
to
*NL*
bring
myself
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
often
wondered
even
at
my
own
hardiness
another
way
,
that
when
*NL*
all
my
companions
were
surprised
and
fell
so
suddenly
into
the
hand
of
*NL*
justice
,
and
that
I
so
narrowly
escaped
,
yet
I
could
not
all
this
while
*NL*
enter
into
one
serious
resolution
to
leave
off
this
trade
,
and
*NL*
especially
considering
that
I
was
now
very
far
from
being
poor
;
that
*NL*
the
temptation
of
necessity
,
which
is
generally
the
introduction
of
all
*NL*
such
wickedness
,
was
now
removed
;
for
I
had
near
#
500
by
me
in
ready
*NL*
money
,
on
which
I
might
have
lived
very
well
,
if
I
had
thought
fit
to
*NL*
have
retired
;
but
I
say
,
I
had
not
so
much
as
the
least
inclination
to
*NL*
leave
off
;
no
,
not
so
much
as
I
had
before
when
I
had
but
#
200
*NL*
beforehand
,
and
when
I
had
no
such
frightful
examples
before
my
eyes
as
*NL*
these
were
.
From
hence
't
is
evident
to
me
,
that
when
once
we
are
*NL*
hardened
in
crime
,
no
fear
can
affect
us
,
no
example
give
us
any
*NL*
warning
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
indeed
one
comrade
whose
fate
went
very
near
me
for
a
good
while
,
*NL*
though
I
wore
it
off
too
in
time
.
That
case
was
indeed
very
unhappy
.
*NL*
I
had
made
a
prize
of
a
piece
of
very
good
damask
in
a
mercer
's
shop
,
*NL*
and
went
clear
off
myself
,
but
had
conveyed
the
piece
to
this
companion
*NL*
of
mine
when
we
went
out
of
the
shop
,
and
she
went
one
way
and
I
went
*NL*
another
.
We
had
not
been
long
out
of
the
shop
but
the
mercer
missed
*NL*
his
piece
of
stuff
,
and
sent
his
messengers
,
one
one
way
and
one
*NL*
another
,
and
they
presently
seized
her
that
had
the
piece
,
with
the
*NL*
damask
upon
her
.
As
for
me
,
I
had
very
luckily
stepped
into
a
house
*NL*
where
there
was
a
lace
chamber
,
up
one
pair
of
stairs
,
and
had
the
*NL*
satisfaction
,
or
the
terror
indeed
,
of
looking
out
of
the
window
upon
*NL*
the
noise
they
made
,
and
seeing
the
poor
creature
dragged
away
in
*NL*
triumph
to
the
justice
,
who
immediately
committed
her
to
Newgate
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
careful
to
attempt
nothing
in
the
lace
chamber
,
but
tumbled
their
*NL*
goods
pretty
much
to
spend
time
;
then
bought
a
few
yards
of
edging
and
*NL*
paid
for
it
,
and
came
away
very
sad-hearted
indeed
for
the
poor
woman
,
*NL*
who
was
in
tribulation
for
what
I
only
had
stolen
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
again
my
old
caution
stood
me
in
good
stead
;
namely
,
that
though
I
*NL*
often
robbed
with
these
people
,
yet
I
never
let
them
know
who
I
was
,
or
*NL*
where
I
lodged
,
nor
could
they
ever
find
out
my
lodging
,
though
they
*NL*
often
endeavoured
to
watch
me
to
it
.
They
all
knew
me
by
the
name
of
*NL*
Moll
Flanders
,
though
even
some
of
them
rather
believed
I
was
she
than
*NL*
knew
me
to
be
so
.
My
name
was
public
among
them
indeed
,
but
how
to
*NL*
find
me
out
they
knew
not
,
nor
so
much
as
how
to
guess
at
my
quarters
,
*NL*
whether
they
were
at
the
east
end
of
the
town
or
the
west
;
and
this
*NL*
wariness
was
my
safety
upon
all
these
occasions
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
kept
close
a
great
while
upon
the
occasion
of
this
woman
's
disaster
.
*NL*
I
knew
that
if
I
should
do
anything
that
should
miscarry
,
and
should
be
*NL*
carried
to
prison
,
she
would
be
there
and
ready
to
witness
against
me
,
*NL*
and
perhaps
save
her
life
at
my
expense
.
I
considered
that
I
began
to
*NL*
be
very
well
known
by
name
at
the
Old
Bailey
,
though
they
did
not
know
*NL*
my
face
,
and
that
if
I
should
fall
into
their
hands
,
I
should
be
*NL*
treated
as
an
old
offender
;
and
for
this
reason
I
was
resolved
to
see
*NL*
what
this
poor
creature
's
fate
should
be
before
I
stirred
abroad
,
*NL*
though
several
times
in
her
distress
I
conveyed
money
to
her
for
her
*NL*
relief
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
she
came
to
her
trial
.
She
pleaded
she
did
not
steal
the
*NL*
thing
,
but
that
one
Mrs.
Flanders
,
as
she
heard
her
called
-LRB-
for
she
did
*NL*
not
know
her
-RRB-
,
gave
the
bundle
to
her
after
they
came
out
of
the
shop
,
*NL*
and
bade
her
carry
it
home
to
her
lodging
.
They
asked
her
where
this
*NL*
Mrs.
Flanders
was
,
but
she
could
not
produce
her
,
neither
could
she
*NL*
give
the
least
account
of
me
;
and
the
mercer
's
men
swearing
positively
*NL*
that
she
was
in
the
shop
when
the
goods
were
stolen
,
that
they
*NL*
immediately
missed
them
,
and
pursued
her
,
and
found
them
upon
her
,
*NL*
thereupon
the
jury
brought
her
in
guilty
;
but
the
Court
,
considering
*NL*
that
she
was
really
not
the
person
that
stole
the
goods
,
an
inferior
*NL*
assistant
,
and
that
it
was
very
possible
she
could
not
find
out
this
*NL*
Mrs.
Flanders
,
meaning
me
,
though
it
would
save
her
life
,
which
indeed
*NL*
was
true
--
I
say
,
considering
all
this
,
they
allowed
her
to
be
*NL*
transported
,
which
was
the
utmost
favour
she
could
obtain
,
only
that
*NL*
the
Court
told
her
that
if
she
could
in
the
meantime
produce
the
said
*NL*
Mrs.
Flanders
,
they
would
intercede
for
her
pardon
;
that
is
to
say
,
if
*NL*
she
could
find
me
out
,
and
hand
me
,
she
should
not
be
transported
.
*NL*
This
I
took
care
to
make
impossible
to
her
,
and
so
she
was
shipped
off
*NL*
in
pursuance
of
her
sentence
a
little
while
after
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
must
repeat
it
again
,
that
the
fate
of
this
poor
woman
troubled
me
*NL*
exceedingly
,
and
I
began
to
be
very
pensive
,
knowing
that
I
was
really
*NL*
the
instrument
of
her
disaster
;
but
the
preservation
of
my
own
life
,
*NL*
which
was
so
evidently
in
danger
,
took
off
all
my
tenderness
;
and
*NL*
seeing
that
she
was
not
put
to
death
,
I
was
very
easy
at
her
*NL*
transportation
,
because
she
was
then
out
of
the
way
of
doing
me
any
*NL*
mischief
,
whatever
should
happen
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
disaster
of
this
woman
was
some
months
before
that
of
the
*NL*
last-recited
story
,
and
was
indeed
partly
occasion
of
my
governess
*NL*
proposing
to
dress
me
up
in
men
's
clothes
,
that
I
might
go
about
*NL*
unobserved
,
as
indeed
I
did
;
but
I
was
soon
tired
of
that
disguise
,
as
*NL*
I
have
said
,
for
indeed
it
exposed
me
to
too
many
difficulties
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
now
easy
as
to
all
fear
of
witnesses
against
me
,
for
all
those
*NL*
that
had
either
been
concerned
with
me
,
or
that
knew
me
by
the
name
of
*NL*
Moll
Flanders
,
were
either
hanged
or
transported
;
and
if
I
should
have
*NL*
had
the
misfortune
to
be
taken
,
I
might
call
myself
anything
else
,
as
*NL*
well
as
Moll
Flanders
,
and
no
old
sins
could
be
placed
into
my
account
;
*NL*
so
I
began
to
run
a-tick
again
with
the
more
freedom
,
and
several
*NL*
successful
adventures
I
made
,
though
not
such
as
I
had
made
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
at
that
time
another
fire
happened
not
a
great
way
off
from
the
*NL*
place
where
my
governess
lived
,
and
I
made
an
attempt
there
,
as
before
,
*NL*
but
as
I
was
not
soon
enough
before
the
crowd
of
people
came
in
,
and
*NL*
could
not
get
to
the
house
I
aimed
at
,
instead
of
a
prize
,
I
got
a
*NL*
mischief
,
which
had
almost
put
a
period
to
my
life
and
all
my
wicked
*NL*
doings
together
;
for
the
fire
being
very
furious
,
and
the
people
in
a
*NL*
great
fright
in
removing
their
goods
,
and
throwing
them
out
of
window
,
*NL*
a
wench
from
out
of
a
window
threw
a
feather-bed
just
upon
me
.
It
is
*NL*
true
,
the
bed
being
soft
,
it
broke
no
bones
;
but
as
the
weight
was
*NL*
great
,
and
made
greater
by
the
fall
,
it
beat
me
down
,
and
laid
me
dead
*NL*
for
a
while
.
Nor
did
the
people
concern
themselves
much
to
deliver
me
*NL*
from
it
,
or
to
recover
me
at
all
;
but
I
lay
like
one
dead
and
neglected
*NL*
a
good
while
,
till
somebody
going
to
remove
the
bed
out
of
the
way
,
*NL*
helped
me
up
.
It
was
indeed
a
wonder
the
people
in
the
house
had
not
*NL*
thrown
other
goods
out
after
it
,
and
which
might
have
fallen
upon
it
,
*NL*
and
then
I
had
been
inevitably
killed
;
but
I
was
reserved
for
further
*NL*
afflictions
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
accident
,
however
,
spoiled
my
market
for
that
time
,
and
I
came
*NL*
home
to
my
governess
very
much
hurt
and
bruised
,
and
frighted
to
the
*NL*
last
degree
,
and
it
was
a
good
while
before
she
could
set
me
upon
my
*NL*
feet
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
now
a
merry
time
of
the
year
,
and
Bartholomew
Fair
was
begun
.
I
*NL*
had
never
made
any
walks
that
way
,
nor
was
the
common
part
of
the
fair
*NL*
of
much
advantage
to
me
;
but
I
took
a
turn
this
year
into
the
*NL*
cloisters
,
and
among
the
rest
I
fell
into
one
of
the
raffling
shops
.
*NL*
It
was
a
thing
of
no
great
consequence
to
me
,
nor
did
I
expect
to
make
*NL*
much
of
it
;
but
there
came
a
gentleman
extremely
well
dressed
and
very
*NL*
rich
,
and
as
't
is
frequent
to
talk
to
everybody
in
those
shops
,
he
*NL*
singled
me
out
,
and
was
very
particular
with
me
.
First
he
told
me
he
*NL*
would
put
in
for
me
to
raffle
,
and
did
so
;
and
some
small
matter
coming
*NL*
to
his
lot
,
he
presented
it
to
me
-LRB-
I
think
it
was
a
feather
muff
-RRB-
;
then
*NL*
he
continued
to
keep
talking
to
me
with
a
more
than
common
appearance
*NL*
of
respect
,
but
still
very
civil
,
and
much
like
a
gentleman
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
held
me
in
talk
so
long
,
till
at
last
he
drew
me
out
of
the
raffling
*NL*
place
to
the
shop-door
,
and
then
to
a
walk
in
the
cloister
,
still
*NL*
talking
of
a
thousand
things
cursorily
without
anything
to
the
purpose
.
*NL*
At
last
he
told
me
that
,
without
compliment
,
he
was
charmed
with
my
*NL*
company
,
and
asked
me
if
I
durst
trust
myself
in
a
coach
with
him
;
he
*NL*
told
me
he
was
a
man
of
honour
,
and
would
not
offer
anything
to
me
*NL*
unbecoming
him
as
such
.
I
seemed
to
decline
it
a
while
,
but
suffered
*NL*
myself
to
be
importuned
a
little
,
and
then
yielded
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
at
a
loss
in
my
thoughts
to
conclude
at
first
what
this
gentleman
*NL*
designed
;
but
I
found
afterwards
he
had
had
some
drink
in
his
head
,
and
*NL*
that
he
was
not
very
unwilling
to
have
some
more
.
He
carried
me
in
the
*NL*
coach
to
the
Spring
Garden
,
at
Knightsbridge
,
where
we
walked
in
the
*NL*
gardens
,
and
he
treated
me
very
handsomely
;
but
I
found
he
drank
very
*NL*
freely
.
He
pressed
me
also
to
drink
,
but
I
declined
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hitherto
he
kept
his
word
with
me
,
and
offered
me
nothing
amiss
.
We
*NL*
came
away
in
the
coach
again
,
and
he
brought
me
into
the
streets
,
and
*NL*
by
this
time
it
was
near
ten
o'clock
at
night
,
and
he
stopped
the
coach
*NL*
at
a
house
where
,
it
seems
,
he
was
acquainted
,
and
where
they
made
no
*NL*
scruple
to
show
us
upstairs
into
a
room
with
a
bed
in
it
.
At
first
I
*NL*
seemed
to
be
unwilling
to
go
up
,
but
after
a
few
words
I
yielded
to
*NL*
that
too
,
being
willing
to
see
the
end
of
it
,
and
in
hope
to
make
*NL*
something
of
it
at
last
.
As
for
the
bed
,
etc.
,
I
was
not
much
*NL*
concerned
about
that
part
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
he
began
to
be
a
little
freer
with
me
than
he
had
promised
;
and
I
*NL*
by
little
and
little
yielded
to
everything
,
so
that
,
in
a
word
,
he
did
*NL*
what
he
pleased
with
me
;
I
need
say
no
more
.
All
this
while
he
drank
*NL*
freely
too
,
and
about
one
in
the
morning
we
went
into
the
coach
again
.
*NL*
The
air
and
the
shaking
of
the
coach
made
the
drink
he
had
get
more
up
*NL*
in
his
head
than
it
was
before
,
and
he
grew
uneasy
in
the
coach
,
and
*NL*
was
for
acting
over
again
what
he
had
been
doing
before
;
but
as
I
*NL*
thought
my
game
now
secure
,
I
resisted
him
,
and
brought
him
to
be
a
*NL*
little
still
,
which
had
not
lasted
five
minutes
but
he
fell
fast
asleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
took
this
opportunity
to
search
him
to
a
nicety
.
I
took
a
gold
*NL*
watch
,
with
a
silk
purse
of
gold
,
his
fine
full-bottom
periwig
and
*NL*
silver-fringed
gloves
,
his
sword
and
fine
snuff-box
,
and
gently
opening
*NL*
the
coach
door
,
stood
ready
to
jump
out
while
the
coach
was
going
on
;
*NL*
but
the
coach
stopped
in
the
narrow
street
beyond
Temple
Bar
to
let
*NL*
another
coach
pass
,
I
got
softly
out
,
fastened
the
door
again
,
and
gave
*NL*
my
gentleman
and
the
coach
the
slip
both
together
,
and
never
heard
more
*NL*
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
an
adventure
indeed
unlooked
for
,
and
perfectly
undesigned
by
*NL*
me
;
though
I
was
not
so
past
the
merry
part
of
life
,
as
to
forget
how
*NL*
to
behave
,
when
a
fop
so
blinded
by
his
appetite
should
not
know
an
old
*NL*
woman
from
a
young
.
I
did
not
indeed
look
so
old
as
I
was
by
ten
or
*NL*
twelve
years
;
yet
I
was
not
a
young
wench
of
seventeen
,
and
it
was
easy
*NL*
enough
to
be
distinguished
.
There
is
nothing
so
absurd
,
so
surfeiting
,
*NL*
so
ridiculous
,
as
a
man
heated
by
wine
in
his
head
,
and
wicked
gust
in
*NL*
his
inclination
together
;
he
is
in
the
possession
of
two
devils
at
*NL*
once
,
and
can
no
more
govern
himself
by
his
reason
than
a
mill
can
*NL*
grind
without
water
;
his
vice
tramples
upon
all
that
was
in
him
that
*NL*
had
any
good
in
it
,
if
any
such
thing
there
was
;
nay
,
his
very
sense
is
*NL*
blinded
by
its
own
rage
,
and
he
acts
absurdities
even
in
his
views
;
*NL*
such
a
drinking
more
,
when
he
is
drunk
already
;
picking
up
a
common
*NL*
woman
,
without
regard
to
what
she
is
or
who
she
is
,
whether
sound
or
*NL*
rotten
,
clean
or
unclean
,
whether
ugly
or
handsome
,
whether
old
or
*NL*
young
,
and
so
blinded
as
not
really
to
distinguish
.
Such
a
man
is
*NL*
worse
than
a
lunatic
;
prompted
by
his
vicious
,
corrupted
head
,
he
no
*NL*
more
knows
what
he
is
doing
than
this
wretch
of
mine
knew
when
I
picked
*NL*
his
pocket
of
his
watch
and
his
purse
of
gold
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
are
the
men
of
whom
Solomon
says
,
`
They
go
like
an
ox
to
the
*NL*
slaughter
,
till
a
dart
strikes
through
their
liver
'
;
an
admirable
*NL*
description
,
by
the
way
,
of
the
foul
disease
,
which
is
a
poisonous
*NL*
deadly
contagion
mingling
with
the
blood
,
whose
centre
or
foundation
is
*NL*
in
the
liver
;
from
whence
,
by
the
swift
circulation
of
the
whole
mass
,
*NL*
that
dreadful
nauseous
plague
strikes
immediately
through
his
liver
,
*NL*
and
his
spirits
are
infected
,
his
vitals
stabbed
through
as
with
a
dart
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
true
this
poor
unguarded
wretch
was
in
no
danger
from
me
,
though
*NL*
I
was
greatly
apprehensive
at
first
of
what
danger
I
might
be
in
from
*NL*
him
;
but
he
was
really
to
be
pitied
in
one
respect
,
that
he
seemed
to
*NL*
be
a
good
sort
of
man
in
himself
;
a
gentleman
that
had
no
harm
in
his
*NL*
design
;
a
man
of
sense
,
and
of
a
fine
behaviour
,
a
comely
handsome
*NL*
person
,
a
sober
solid
countenance
,
a
charming
beautiful
face
,
and
*NL*
everything
that
could
be
agreeable
;
only
had
unhappily
had
some
drink
*NL*
the
night
before
,
had
not
been
in
bed
,
as
he
told
me
when
we
were
*NL*
together
;
was
hot
,
and
his
blood
fired
with
wine
,
and
in
that
condition
*NL*
his
reason
,
as
it
were
asleep
,
had
given
him
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
me
,
my
business
was
his
money
,
and
what
I
could
make
of
him
;
and
*NL*
after
that
,
if
I
could
have
found
out
any
way
to
have
done
it
,
I
would
*NL*
have
sent
him
safe
home
to
his
house
and
to
his
family
,
for
't
was
ten
*NL*
to
one
but
he
had
an
honest
,
virtuous
wife
and
innocent
children
,
that
*NL*
were
anxious
for
his
safety
,
and
would
have
been
glad
to
have
gotten
*NL*
him
home
,
and
have
taken
care
of
him
till
he
was
restored
to
himself
.
*NL*
And
then
with
what
shame
and
regret
would
he
look
back
upon
himself
!
*NL*
how
would
he
reproach
himself
with
associating
himself
with
a
whore
!
*NL*
picked
up
in
the
worst
of
all
holes
,
the
cloister
,
among
the
dirt
and
*NL*
filth
of
all
the
town
!
how
would
he
be
trembling
for
fear
he
had
got
*NL*
the
pox
,
for
fear
a
dart
had
struck
through
his
liver
,
and
hate
himself
*NL*
every
time
he
looked
back
upon
the
madness
and
brutality
of
his
*NL*
debauch
!
how
would
he
,
if
he
had
any
principles
of
honour
,
as
I
verily
*NL*
believe
he
had
--
I
say
,
how
would
he
abhor
the
thought
of
giving
any
ill
*NL*
distemper
,
if
he
had
it
,
as
for
aught
he
knew
he
might
,
to
his
modest
*NL*
and
virtuous
wife
,
and
thereby
sowing
the
contagion
in
the
life-blood
*NL*
of
his
posterity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Would
such
gentlemen
but
consider
the
contemptible
thoughts
which
the
*NL*
very
women
they
are
concerned
with
,
in
such
cases
as
these
,
have
of
*NL*
them
,
it
would
be
a
surfeit
to
them
.
As
I
said
above
,
they
value
not
*NL*
the
pleasure
,
they
are
raised
by
no
inclination
to
the
man
,
the
passive
*NL*
jade
thinks
of
no
pleasure
but
the
money
;
and
when
he
is
,
as
it
were
,
*NL*
drunk
in
the
ecstasies
of
his
wicked
pleasure
,
her
hands
are
in
his
*NL*
pockets
searching
for
what
she
can
find
there
,
and
of
which
he
can
no
*NL*
more
be
sensible
in
the
moment
of
his
folly
that
he
can
forethink
of
it
*NL*
when
he
goes
about
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
knew
a
woman
that
was
so
dexterous
with
a
fellow
,
who
indeed
deserved
*NL*
no
better
usage
,
that
while
he
was
busy
with
her
another
way
,
conveyed
*NL*
his
purse
with
twenty
guineas
in
it
out
of
his
fob-pocket
,
where
he
had
*NL*
put
it
for
fear
of
her
,
and
put
another
purse
with
gilded
counters
in
*NL*
it
into
the
room
of
it
.
After
he
had
done
,
he
says
to
her
,
`
Now
ha
n't
*NL*
you
picked
my
pocket
?
'
She
jested
with
him
,
and
told
him
she
supposed
*NL*
he
had
not
much
to
lose
;
he
put
his
hand
to
his
fob
,
and
with
his
*NL*
fingers
felt
that
his
purse
was
there
,
which
fully
satisfied
him
,
and
*NL*
so
she
brought
off
his
money
.
And
this
was
a
trade
with
her
;
she
kept
*NL*
a
sham
gold
watch
,
that
is
,
a
watch
of
silver
gilt
,
and
a
purse
of
*NL*
counters
in
her
pocket
to
be
ready
on
all
such
occasions
,
and
I
doubt
*NL*
not
practiced
it
with
success
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
came
home
with
this
last
booty
to
my
governess
,
and
really
when
I
*NL*
told
her
the
story
,
it
so
affected
her
that
she
was
hardly
able
to
*NL*
forbear
tears
,
to
know
how
such
a
gentleman
ran
a
daily
risk
of
being
*NL*
undone
every
time
a
glass
of
wine
got
into
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
as
to
the
purchase
I
got
,
and
how
entirely
I
stripped
him
,
she
told
*NL*
me
it
pleased
her
wonderfully
.
`
Nay
child
,
'
says
she
,
`
the
usage
may
,
*NL*
for
aught
I
know
,
do
more
to
reform
him
than
all
the
sermons
that
ever
*NL*
he
will
hear
in
his
life
.
'
And
if
the
remainder
of
the
story
be
true
,
*NL*
so
it
did
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
found
the
next
day
she
was
wonderful
inquisitive
about
this
*NL*
gentleman
;
the
description
I
had
given
her
of
him
,
his
dress
,
his
*NL*
person
,
his
face
,
everything
concurred
to
make
her
think
of
a
gentleman
*NL*
whose
character
she
knew
,
and
family
too
.
She
mused
a
while
,
and
I
*NL*
going
still
on
with
the
particulars
,
she
starts
up
;
says
she
,
`
I
'll
lay
*NL*
#
100
I
know
the
gentleman
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
am
sorry
you
do
,
'
says
I
,
`
for
I
would
not
have
him
exposed
on
any
*NL*
account
in
the
world
;
he
has
had
injury
enough
already
by
me
,
and
I
*NL*
would
not
be
instrumental
to
do
him
any
more
.
'
`
No
,
no
,
'
says
she
,
'
I
*NL*
will
do
him
no
injury
,
I
assure
you
,
but
you
may
let
me
satisfy
my
*NL*
curiosity
a
little
,
for
if
it
is
he
,
I
warrant
you
I
find
it
out
.
'
I
*NL*
was
a
little
startled
at
that
,
and
told
her
,
with
an
apparent
concern
*NL*
in
my
face
,
that
by
the
same
rule
he
might
find
me
out
,
and
then
I
was
*NL*
undone
.
She
returned
warmly
,
`
Why
,
do
you
think
I
will
betray
you
,
*NL*
child
?
No
,
no
,
'
says
she
,
`
not
for
all
he
is
worth
in
the
world
.
I
*NL*
have
kept
your
counsel
in
worse
things
than
these
;
sure
you
may
trust
*NL*
me
in
this
.
'
So
I
said
no
more
at
that
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
laid
her
scheme
another
way
,
and
without
acquainting
me
of
it
,
but
*NL*
she
was
resolved
to
find
it
out
if
possible
.
So
she
goes
to
a
certain
*NL*
friend
of
hers
who
was
acquainted
in
the
family
that
she
guessed
at
,
*NL*
and
told
her
friend
she
had
some
extraordinary
business
with
such
a
*NL*
gentleman
-LRB-
who
,
by
the
way
,
was
no
less
than
a
baronet
,
and
of
a
very
*NL*
good
family
-RRB-
,
and
that
she
knew
not
how
to
come
at
him
without
somebody
*NL*
to
introduce
her
.
Her
friend
promised
her
very
readily
to
do
it
,
and
*NL*
accordingly
goes
to
the
house
to
see
if
the
gentleman
was
in
town
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
she
come
to
my
governess
and
tells
her
that
Sir
--
was
*NL*
at
home
,
but
that
he
had
met
with
a
disaster
and
was
very
ill
,
and
*NL*
there
was
no
speaking
with
him
.
`
What
disaster
?
'
says
my
governess
*NL*
hastily
,
as
if
she
was
surprised
at
it
.
`
Why
,
'
says
her
friend
,
`
he
*NL*
had
been
at
Hampstead
to
visit
a
gentleman
of
his
acquaintance
,
and
as
*NL*
he
came
back
again
he
was
set
upon
and
robbed
;
and
having
got
a
little
*NL*
drink
too
,
as
they
suppose
,
the
rogues
abused
him
,
and
he
is
very
ill
.
'
*NL*
`
Robbed
!
'
says
my
governess
,
`
and
what
did
they
take
from
him
?
'
`
Why
,
'
*NL*
says
her
friend
,
`
they
took
his
gold
watch
and
his
gold
snuff-box
,
his
*NL*
fine
periwig
,
and
what
money
he
had
in
his
pocket
,
which
was
*NL*
considerable
,
to
be
sure
,
for
Sir
--
never
goes
without
a
purse
of
*NL*
guineas
about
him
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Pshaw
!
'
says
my
old
governess
,
jeering
,
'
I
warrant
you
he
has
got
*NL*
drunk
now
and
got
a
whore
,
and
she
has
picked
his
pocket
,
and
so
he
*NL*
comes
home
to
his
wife
and
tells
her
he
has
been
robbed
.
That
's
an
old
*NL*
sham
;
a
thousand
such
tricks
are
put
upon
the
poor
women
every
day
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Fie
!
'
says
her
friend
,
'
I
find
you
do
n't
know
Sir
--
;
why
he
is
as
*NL*
civil
a
gentleman
,
there
is
not
a
finer
man
,
nor
a
soberer
,
graver
,
*NL*
modester
person
in
the
whole
city
;
he
abhors
such
things
;
there
's
*NL*
nobody
that
knows
him
will
think
such
a
thing
of
him
.
'
`
Well
,
well
,
'
*NL*
says
my
governess
,
`
that
's
none
of
my
business
;
if
it
was
,
I
warrant
I
*NL*
should
find
there
was
something
of
that
kind
in
it
;
your
modest
men
in
*NL*
common
opinion
are
sometimes
no
better
than
other
people
,
only
they
*NL*
keep
a
better
character
,
or
,
if
you
please
,
are
the
better
hypocrites
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
no
,
'
says
her
friend
,
'
I
can
assure
you
Sir
--
is
no
hypocrite
,
*NL*
he
is
really
an
honest
,
sober
gentleman
,
and
he
has
certainly
been
*NL*
robbed
.
'
`
Nay
,
'
says
my
governess
,
`
it
may
be
he
has
;
it
is
no
*NL*
business
of
mine
,
I
tell
you
;
I
only
want
to
speak
with
him
;
my
*NL*
business
is
of
another
nature
.
'
`
But
,
'
says
her
friend
,
`
let
your
*NL*
business
be
of
what
nature
it
will
,
you
can
not
see
him
yet
,
for
he
is
*NL*
not
fit
to
be
seen
,
for
he
is
very
ill
,
and
bruised
very
much
,
'
`
Ay
,
'
*NL*
says
my
governess
,
`
nay
,
then
he
has
fallen
into
bad
hands
,
to
be
*NL*
sure
,
'
And
then
she
asked
gravely
,
`
Pray
,
where
is
he
bruised
?
'
`
Why
,
*NL*
in
the
head
,
'
says
her
friend
,
`
and
one
of
his
hands
,
and
his
face
,
for
*NL*
they
used
him
barbarously
.
'
`
Poor
gentleman
,
'
says
my
governess
,
'
I
*NL*
must
wait
,
then
,
till
he
recovers
'
;
and
adds
,
'
I
hope
it
will
not
be
*NL*
long
,
for
I
want
very
much
to
speak
with
him
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Away
she
comes
to
me
and
tells
me
this
story
.
'
I
have
found
out
your
*NL*
fine
gentleman
,
and
a
fine
gentleman
he
was
,
'
says
she
;
`
but
,
mercy
on
*NL*
him
,
he
is
in
a
sad
pickle
now
.
I
wonder
what
the
d
--
l
you
have
done
*NL*
to
him
;
why
,
you
have
almost
killed
him
.
'
I
looked
at
her
with
*NL*
disorder
enough
.
'
I
killed
him
!
'
says
I
;
`
you
must
mistake
the
person
;
*NL*
I
am
sure
I
did
nothing
to
him
;
he
was
very
well
when
I
left
him
,
'
said
*NL*
I
,
`
only
drunk
and
fast
asleep
.
'
'
I
know
nothing
of
that
,
'
says
she
,
*NL*
`
but
he
is
in
a
sad
pickle
now
'
;
and
so
she
told
me
all
that
her
friend
*NL*
had
said
to
her
.
`
Well
,
then
,
'
says
I
,
`
he
fell
into
bad
hands
after
I
*NL*
left
him
,
for
I
am
sure
I
left
him
safe
enough
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
About
ten
days
after
,
or
a
little
more
,
my
governess
goes
again
to
her
*NL*
friend
,
to
introduce
her
to
this
gentleman
;
she
had
inquired
other
ways
*NL*
in
the
meantime
,
and
found
that
he
was
about
again
,
if
not
abroad
*NL*
again
,
so
she
got
leave
to
speak
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
a
woman
of
a
admirable
address
,
and
wanted
nobody
to
introduce
*NL*
her
;
she
told
her
tale
much
better
than
I
shall
be
able
to
tell
it
for
*NL*
her
,
for
she
was
a
mistress
of
her
tongue
,
as
I
have
said
already
.
She
*NL*
told
him
that
she
came
,
though
a
stranger
,
with
a
single
design
of
*NL*
doing
him
a
service
and
he
should
find
she
had
no
other
end
in
it
;
that
*NL*
as
she
came
purely
on
so
friendly
an
account
,
she
begged
promise
from
*NL*
him
,
that
if
he
did
not
accept
what
she
should
officiously
propose
he
*NL*
would
not
take
it
ill
that
she
meddled
with
what
was
not
her
business
.
*NL*
She
assured
him
that
as
what
she
had
to
say
was
a
secret
that
belonged
*NL*
to
him
only
,
so
whether
he
accepted
her
offer
or
not
,
it
should
remain
*NL*
a
secret
to
all
the
world
,
unless
he
exposed
it
himself
;
nor
should
his
*NL*
refusing
her
service
in
it
make
her
so
little
show
her
respect
as
to
do
*NL*
him
the
least
injury
,
so
that
he
should
be
entirely
at
liberty
to
act
*NL*
as
he
thought
fit
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
very
shy
at
first
,
and
said
he
knew
nothing
that
related
to
*NL*
him
that
required
much
secrecy
;
that
he
had
never
done
any
man
any
*NL*
wrong
,
and
cared
not
what
anybody
might
say
of
him
;
that
it
was
no
part
*NL*
of
his
character
to
be
unjust
to
anybody
,
nor
could
he
imagine
in
what
*NL*
any
man
could
render
him
any
service
;
but
that
if
it
was
so
*NL*
disinterested
a
service
as
she
said
,
he
could
not
take
it
ill
from
any
*NL*
one
that
they
should
endeavour
to
serve
him
;
and
so
,
as
it
were
,
left
*NL*
her
a
liberty
either
to
tell
him
or
not
to
tell
,
as
she
thought
fit
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
found
him
so
perfectly
indifferent
,
that
she
was
almost
afraid
to
*NL*
enter
into
the
point
with
him
;
but
,
however
,
after
some
other
*NL*
circumlocutions
she
told
him
that
by
a
strange
and
unaccountable
*NL*
accident
she
came
to
have
a
particular
knowledge
of
the
late
unhappy
*NL*
adventure
he
had
fallen
into
,
and
that
in
such
a
manner
,
that
there
was
*NL*
nobody
in
the
world
but
herself
and
him
that
were
acquainted
with
it
,
*NL*
no
,
not
the
very
person
that
was
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
a
little
angrily
at
first
.
`
What
adventure
?
'
said
he
.
*NL*
`
Why
,
'
said
she
,
`
of
your
being
robbed
coming
from
Knightbr
--
;
*NL*
Hampstead
,
sir
,
I
should
say
,
'
says
she
.
`
Be
not
surprised
,
sir
,
'
says
*NL*
she
,
`
that
I
am
able
to
tell
you
every
step
you
took
that
day
from
the
*NL*
cloister
in
Smithfield
to
the
Spring
Garden
at
Knightsbridge
,
and
*NL*
thence
to
the
--
in
the
Strand
,
and
how
you
were
left
asleep
in
the
*NL*
coach
afterwards
.
I
say
,
let
not
this
surprise
you
,
for
,
sir
,
I
do
not
*NL*
come
to
make
a
booty
of
you
,
I
ask
nothing
of
you
,
and
I
assure
you
the
*NL*
woman
that
was
with
you
knows
nothing
who
you
are
,
and
never
shall
;
and
*NL*
yet
perhaps
I
may
serve
you
further
still
,
for
I
did
not
come
barely
to
*NL*
let
you
know
that
I
was
informed
of
these
things
,
as
if
I
wanted
a
*NL*
bribe
to
conceal
them
;
assure
yourself
,
sir
,
'
said
she
,
`
that
whatever
*NL*
you
think
fit
to
do
or
say
to
me
,
it
shall
be
all
a
secret
as
it
is
,
as
*NL*
much
as
if
I
were
in
my
grave
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
astonished
at
her
discourse
,
and
said
gravely
to
her
,
`
Madam
,
*NL*
you
are
a
stranger
to
me
,
but
it
is
very
unfortunate
that
you
should
be
*NL*
let
into
the
secret
of
the
worst
action
of
my
life
,
and
a
thing
that
I
*NL*
am
so
justly
ashamed
of
,
that
the
only
satisfaction
of
it
to
me
was
,
*NL*
that
I
thought
it
was
known
only
to
God
and
my
own
conscience
.
'
`
Pray
,
*NL*
sir
,
'
says
she
,
`
do
not
reckon
the
discovery
of
it
to
me
to
be
any
part
*NL*
of
your
misfortune
.
It
was
a
thing
,
I
believe
,
you
were
surprised
*NL*
into
,
and
perhaps
the
woman
used
some
art
to
prompt
you
to
it
;
however
,
*NL*
you
will
never
find
any
just
cause
,
'
said
she
,
`
to
repent
that
I
came
*NL*
to
hear
of
it
;
nor
can
your
own
mouth
be
more
silent
in
it
that
I
have
*NL*
been
,
and
ever
shall
be
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
'
says
he
,
`
but
let
me
do
some
justice
to
the
woman
too
;
whoever
*NL*
she
is
,
I
do
assure
you
she
prompted
me
to
nothing
,
she
rather
declined
*NL*
me
.
It
was
my
own
folly
and
madness
that
brought
me
into
it
all
,
ay
,
*NL*
and
brought
her
into
it
too
;
I
must
give
her
her
due
so
far
.
As
to
*NL*
what
she
took
from
me
,
I
could
expect
no
less
from
her
in
the
condition
*NL*
I
was
in
,
and
to
this
hour
I
know
not
whether
she
robbed
me
or
the
*NL*
coachman
;
if
she
did
it
,
I
forgive
her
,
and
I
think
all
gentlemen
that
*NL*
do
so
should
be
used
in
the
same
manner
;
but
I
am
more
concerned
for
*NL*
some
other
things
that
I
am
for
all
that
she
took
from
me
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
My
governess
now
began
to
come
into
the
whole
matter
,
and
he
opened
*NL*
himself
freely
to
her
.
First
she
said
to
him
,
in
answer
to
what
he
had
*NL*
said
about
me
,
'
I
am
glad
,
sir
,
you
are
so
just
to
the
person
that
you
*NL*
were
with
;
I
assure
you
she
is
a
gentlewoman
,
and
no
woman
of
the
town
;
*NL*
and
however
you
prevailed
with
her
so
far
as
you
did
,
I
am
sure
't
is
*NL*
not
her
practice
.
You
ran
a
great
venture
indeed
,
sir
;
but
if
that
be
*NL*
any
part
of
your
care
,
I
am
persuaded
you
may
be
perfectly
easy
,
for
I
*NL*
dare
assure
you
no
man
has
touched
her
,
before
you
,
since
her
husband
,
*NL*
and
he
has
been
dead
now
almost
eight
years
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
It
appeared
that
this
was
his
grievance
,
and
that
he
was
in
a
very
*NL*
great
fright
about
it
;
however
,
when
my
governess
said
this
to
him
,
he
*NL*
appeared
very
well
pleased
,
and
said
,
`
Well
,
madam
,
to
be
plain
with
*NL*
you
,
if
I
was
satisfied
of
that
,
I
should
not
so
much
value
what
I
*NL*
lost
;
for
,
as
to
that
,
the
temptation
was
great
,
and
perhaps
she
was
*NL*
poor
and
wanted
it
.
'
`
If
she
had
not
been
poor
,
sir
--
,
'
says
my
*NL*
governess
,
'
I
assure
you
she
would
never
have
yielded
to
you
;
and
as
*NL*
her
poverty
first
prevailed
with
her
to
let
you
do
as
you
did
,
so
the
*NL*
same
poverty
prevailed
with
her
to
pay
herself
at
last
,
when
she
saw
*NL*
you
were
in
such
a
condition
,
that
if
she
had
not
done
it
,
perhaps
the
*NL*
next
coachman
might
have
done
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
'
says
he
,
`
much
good
may
it
do
her
.
I
say
again
,
all
the
*NL*
gentlemen
that
do
so
ought
to
be
used
in
the
same
manner
,
and
then
they
*NL*
would
be
cautious
of
themselves
.
I
have
no
more
concern
about
it
,
but
*NL*
on
the
score
which
you
hinted
at
before
,
madam
.
'
Here
he
entered
into
*NL*
some
freedoms
with
her
on
the
subject
of
what
passed
between
us
,
which
*NL*
are
not
so
proper
for
a
woman
to
write
,
and
the
great
terror
that
was
*NL*
upon
his
mind
with
relation
to
his
wife
,
for
fear
he
should
have
*NL*
received
any
injury
from
me
,
and
should
communicate
if
farther
;
and
*NL*
asked
her
at
last
if
she
could
not
procure
him
an
opportunity
to
speak
*NL*
with
me
.
My
governess
gave
him
further
assurances
of
my
being
a
woman
*NL*
clear
from
any
such
thing
,
and
that
he
was
as
entirely
safe
in
that
*NL*
respect
as
he
was
with
his
own
lady
;
but
as
for
seeing
me
,
she
said
it
*NL*
might
be
of
dangerous
consequence
;
but
,
however
,
that
she
would
talk
*NL*
with
me
,
and
let
him
know
my
answer
,
using
at
the
same
time
some
*NL*
arguments
to
persuade
him
not
to
desire
it
,
and
that
it
could
be
of
no
*NL*
service
to
him
,
seeing
she
hoped
he
had
no
desire
to
renew
a
*NL*
correspondence
with
me
,
and
that
on
my
account
it
was
a
kind
of
putting
*NL*
my
life
in
his
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
told
her
he
had
a
great
desire
to
see
me
,
that
he
would
give
her
any
*NL*
assurances
that
were
in
his
power
,
not
to
take
any
advantages
of
me
,
*NL*
and
that
in
the
first
place
he
would
give
me
a
general
release
from
all
*NL*
demands
of
any
kind
.
She
insisted
how
it
might
tend
to
a
further
*NL*
divulging
the
secret
,
and
might
in
the
end
be
injurious
to
him
,
*NL*
entreating
him
not
to
press
for
it
;
so
at
length
he
desisted
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
some
discourse
upon
the
subject
of
the
things
he
had
lost
,
and
*NL*
he
seemed
to
be
very
desirous
of
his
gold
watch
,
and
told
her
if
she
*NL*
could
procure
that
for
him
,
he
would
willingly
give
as
much
for
it
as
*NL*
it
was
worth
.
She
told
him
she
would
endeavour
to
procure
it
for
him
,
*NL*
and
leave
the
valuing
it
to
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Accordingly
the
next
day
she
carried
the
watch
,
and
he
gave
her
thirty
*NL*
guineas
for
it
,
which
was
more
than
I
should
have
been
able
to
make
of
*NL*
it
,
though
it
seems
it
cost
much
more
.
He
spoke
something
of
his
*NL*
periwig
,
which
it
seems
cost
him
threescore
guineas
,
and
his
snuff-box
,
*NL*
and
in
a
few
days
more
she
carried
them
too
;
which
obliged
him
very
*NL*
much
,
and
he
gave
her
thirty
more
.
The
next
day
I
sent
him
his
fine
*NL*
sword
and
cane
gratis
,
and
demanded
nothing
of
him
,
but
I
had
no
mind
*NL*
to
see
him
,
unless
it
had
been
so
that
he
might
be
satisfied
I
knew
who
*NL*
he
was
,
which
he
was
not
willing
to
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
entered
into
a
long
talk
with
her
of
the
manner
how
she
came
to
*NL*
know
all
this
matter
.
She
formed
a
long
tale
of
that
part
;
how
she
had
*NL*
it
from
one
that
I
had
told
the
whole
story
to
,
and
that
was
to
help
me
*NL*
dispose
of
the
goods
;
and
this
confidante
brought
the
things
to
her
,
*NL*
she
being
by
profession
a
pawnbroker
;
and
she
hearing
of
his
worship
's
*NL*
disaster
,
guessed
at
the
thing
in
general
;
that
having
gotten
the
*NL*
things
into
her
hands
,
she
had
resolved
to
come
and
try
as
she
had
*NL*
done
.
She
then
gave
him
repeated
assurances
that
it
should
never
go
*NL*
out
of
her
mouth
,
and
though
she
knew
the
woman
very
well
,
yet
she
had
*NL*
not
let
her
know
,
meaning
me
,
anything
of
it
;
that
is
to
say
,
who
the
*NL*
person
was
,
which
,
by
the
way
,
was
false
;
but
,
however
,
it
was
not
to
*NL*
his
damage
,
for
I
never
opened
my
mouth
of
it
to
anybody
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
a
great
many
thoughts
in
my
head
about
my
seeing
him
again
,
and
*NL*
was
often
sorry
that
I
had
refused
it
.
I
was
persuaded
that
if
I
had
*NL*
seen
him
,
and
let
him
know
that
I
knew
him
,
I
should
have
made
some
*NL*
advantage
of
him
,
and
perhaps
have
had
some
maintenance
from
him
;
and
*NL*
though
it
was
a
life
wicked
enough
,
yet
it
was
not
so
full
of
danger
as
*NL*
this
I
was
engaged
in
.
However
,
those
thoughts
wore
off
,
and
I
*NL*
declined
seeing
him
again
,
for
that
time
;
but
my
governess
saw
him
*NL*
often
,
and
he
was
very
kind
to
her
,
giving
her
something
almost
every
*NL*
time
he
saw
her
.
One
time
in
particular
she
found
him
very
merry
,
and
*NL*
as
she
thought
he
had
some
wine
in
his
head
,
and
he
pressed
her
again
*NL*
very
earnestly
to
let
him
see
that
woman
that
,
as
he
said
,
had
*NL*
bewitched
him
so
that
night
,
my
governess
,
who
was
from
the
beginning
*NL*
for
my
seeing
him
,
told
him
he
was
so
desirous
of
it
that
she
could
*NL*
almost
yield
of
it
,
if
she
could
prevail
upon
me
;
adding
that
if
he
*NL*
would
please
to
come
to
her
house
in
the
evening
,
she
would
endeavour
*NL*
it
,
upon
his
repeated
assurances
of
forgetting
what
was
past
.
*NL*
*NL*
Accordingly
she
came
to
me
,
and
told
me
all
the
discourse
;
in
short
,
*NL*
she
soon
biassed
me
to
consent
,
in
a
case
which
I
had
some
regret
in
my
*NL*
mind
for
declining
before
;
so
I
prepared
to
see
him
.
I
dressed
me
to
*NL*
all
the
advantage
possible
,
I
assure
you
,
and
for
the
first
time
used
a
*NL*
little
art
;
I
say
for
the
first
time
,
for
I
had
never
yielded
to
the
*NL*
baseness
of
paint
before
,
having
always
had
vanity
enough
to
believe
I
*NL*
had
no
need
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
hour
appointed
he
came
;
and
as
she
observed
before
,
so
it
was
*NL*
plain
still
,
that
he
had
been
drinking
,
though
very
far
from
what
we
*NL*
call
being
in
drink
.
He
appeared
exceeding
pleased
to
see
me
,
and
*NL*
entered
into
a
long
discourse
with
me
upon
the
old
affair
.
I
begged
*NL*
his
pardon
very
often
for
my
share
of
it
,
protested
I
had
not
any
such
*NL*
design
when
first
I
met
him
,
that
I
had
not
gone
out
with
him
but
that
*NL*
I
took
him
for
a
very
civil
gentleman
,
and
that
he
made
me
so
many
*NL*
promises
of
offering
no
uncivility
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
alleged
the
wine
he
drank
,
and
that
he
scarce
knew
what
he
did
,
and
*NL*
that
if
it
had
not
been
so
,
I
should
never
have
let
him
take
the
*NL*
freedom
with
me
that
he
had
done
.
He
protested
to
me
that
he
never
*NL*
touched
any
woman
but
me
since
he
was
married
to
his
wife
,
and
it
was
a
*NL*
surprise
upon
him
;
complimented
me
upon
being
so
particularly
agreeable
*NL*
to
him
,
and
the
like
;
and
talked
so
much
of
that
kind
,
till
I
found
he
*NL*
had
talked
himself
almost
into
a
temper
to
do
the
same
thing
over
*NL*
again
.
But
I
took
him
up
short
.
I
protested
I
had
never
suffered
any
*NL*
man
to
touch
me
since
my
husband
died
,
which
was
near
eight
years
.
He
*NL*
said
he
believed
it
to
be
so
truly
;
and
added
that
madam
had
intimated
*NL*
as
much
to
him
,
and
that
it
was
his
opinion
of
that
part
which
made
his
*NL*
desire
to
see
me
again
;
and
that
since
he
had
once
broke
in
upon
his
*NL*
virtue
with
me
,
and
found
no
ill
consequences
,
he
could
be
safe
in
*NL*
venturing
there
again
;
and
so
,
in
short
,
it
went
on
to
what
I
expected
,
*NL*
and
to
what
will
not
bear
relating
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
old
governess
had
foreseen
it
,
as
well
as
I
,
and
therefore
led
him
*NL*
into
a
room
which
had
not
a
bed
in
it
,
and
yet
had
a
chamber
within
it
*NL*
which
had
a
bed
,
whither
we
withdrew
for
the
rest
of
the
night
;
and
,
in
*NL*
short
,
after
some
time
being
together
,
he
went
to
bed
,
and
lay
there
*NL*
all
night
.
I
withdrew
,
but
came
again
undressed
in
the
morning
,
before
*NL*
it
was
day
,
and
lay
with
him
the
rest
of
the
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
,
you
see
,
having
committed
a
crime
once
is
a
sad
handle
to
the
*NL*
committing
of
it
again
;
whereas
all
the
regret
and
reflections
wear
off
*NL*
when
the
temptation
renews
itself
.
Had
I
not
yielded
to
see
him
again
,
*NL*
the
corrupt
desire
in
him
had
worn
off
,
and
't
is
very
probable
he
had
*NL*
never
fallen
into
it
with
anybody
else
,
as
I
really
believe
he
had
not
*NL*
done
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
went
away
,
I
told
him
I
hoped
he
was
satisfied
he
had
not
been
*NL*
robbed
again
.
He
told
me
he
was
satisfied
in
that
point
,
and
could
*NL*
trust
me
again
,
and
putting
his
hand
in
his
pocket
,
gave
me
five
*NL*
guineas
,
which
was
the
first
money
I
had
gained
that
way
for
many
years
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
several
visits
of
the
like
kind
from
him
,
but
he
never
came
into
*NL*
a
settled
way
of
maintenance
,
which
was
what
I
would
have
best
pleased
*NL*
with
.
Once
,
indeed
,
he
asked
me
how
I
did
to
live
.
I
answered
him
*NL*
pretty
quick
,
that
I
assured
him
I
had
never
taken
that
course
that
I
*NL*
took
with
him
,
but
that
indeed
I
worked
at
my
needle
,
and
could
just
*NL*
maintain
myself
;
that
sometime
it
was
as
much
as
I
was
able
to
do
,
and
*NL*
I
shifted
hard
enough
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
seemed
to
reflect
upon
himself
that
he
should
be
the
first
person
to
*NL*
lead
me
into
that
,
which
he
assured
me
he
never
intended
to
do
himself
;
*NL*
and
it
touched
him
a
little
,
he
said
,
that
he
should
be
the
cause
of
*NL*
his
own
sin
and
mine
too
.
He
would
often
make
just
reflections
also
*NL*
upon
the
crime
itself
,
and
upon
the
particular
circumstances
of
it
with
*NL*
respect
to
himself
;
how
wine
introduced
the
inclinations
how
the
devil
*NL*
led
him
to
the
place
,
and
found
out
an
object
to
tempt
him
,
and
he
made
*NL*
the
moral
always
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
these
thoughts
were
upon
him
he
would
go
away
,
and
perhaps
not
*NL*
come
again
in
a
month
's
time
or
longer
;
but
then
as
the
serious
part
*NL*
wore
off
,
the
lewd
part
would
wear
in
,
and
then
he
came
prepared
for
*NL*
the
wicked
part
.
Thus
we
lived
for
some
time
;
thought
he
did
not
keep
,
*NL*
as
they
call
it
,
yet
he
never
failed
doing
things
that
were
handsome
,
*NL*
and
sufficient
to
maintain
me
without
working
,
and
,
which
was
better
,
*NL*
without
following
my
old
trade
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
this
affair
had
its
end
too
;
for
after
about
a
year
,
I
found
that
*NL*
he
did
not
come
so
often
as
usual
,
and
at
last
he
left
if
off
*NL*
altogether
without
any
dislike
to
bidding
adieu
;
and
so
there
was
an
*NL*
end
of
that
short
scene
of
life
,
which
added
no
great
store
to
me
,
only
*NL*
to
make
more
work
for
repentance
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
during
this
interval
I
confined
myself
pretty
much
at
home
;
at
*NL*
least
,
being
thus
provided
for
,
I
made
no
adventures
,
no
,
not
for
a
*NL*
quarter
of
a
year
after
he
left
me
;
but
then
finding
the
fund
fail
,
and
*NL*
being
loth
to
spend
upon
the
main
stock
,
I
began
to
think
of
my
old
*NL*
trade
,
and
to
look
abroad
into
the
street
again
;
and
my
first
step
was
*NL*
lucky
enough
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
dressed
myself
up
in
a
very
mean
habit
,
for
as
I
had
several
*NL*
shapes
to
appear
in
,
I
was
now
in
an
ordinary
stuff-gown
,
a
blue
apron
,
*NL*
and
a
straw
hat
and
I
placed
myself
at
the
door
of
the
Three
Cups
Inn
*NL*
in
St.
John
Street
.
There
were
several
carriers
used
the
inn
,
and
the
*NL*
stage-coaches
for
Barnet
,
for
Totteridge
,
and
other
towns
that
way
*NL*
stood
always
in
the
street
in
the
evening
,
when
they
prepared
to
set
*NL*
out
,
so
that
I
was
ready
for
anything
that
offered
,
for
either
one
or
*NL*
other
.
The
meaning
was
this
;
people
come
frequently
with
bundles
and
*NL*
small
parcels
to
those
inns
,
and
call
for
such
carriers
or
coaches
as
*NL*
they
want
,
to
carry
them
into
the
country
;
and
there
generally
attend
*NL*
women
,
porters
'
wives
or
daughters
,
ready
to
take
in
such
things
for
*NL*
their
respective
people
that
employ
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
happened
very
oddly
that
I
was
standing
at
the
inn
gate
,
and
a
woman
*NL*
that
had
stood
there
before
,
and
which
was
the
porter
's
wife
belonging
*NL*
to
the
Barnet
stage-coach
,
having
observed
me
,
asked
if
I
waited
for
*NL*
any
of
the
coaches
.
I
told
her
Yes
,
I
waited
for
my
mistress
,
that
was
*NL*
coming
to
go
to
Barnet
.
She
asked
me
who
was
my
mistress
,
and
I
told
*NL*
her
any
madam
's
name
that
came
next
me
;
but
as
it
seemed
,
I
happened
*NL*
upon
a
name
,
a
family
of
which
name
lived
at
Hadley
,
just
beyond
Barnet
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
said
no
more
to
her
,
or
she
to
me
,
a
good
while
;
but
by
and
by
,
*NL*
somebody
calling
her
at
a
door
a
little
way
off
,
she
desired
me
that
if
*NL*
anybody
called
for
the
Barnet
coach
,
I
would
step
and
call
her
at
the
*NL*
house
,
which
it
seems
was
an
alehouse
.
I
said
Yes
,
very
readily
,
and
*NL*
away
she
went
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
no
sooner
gone
but
comes
a
wench
and
a
child
,
puffing
and
*NL*
sweating
,
and
asks
for
the
Barnet
coach
.
I
answered
presently
,
`
Here
.
'
*NL*
`
Do
you
belong
to
the
Barnet
coach
?
'
says
she
.
`
Yes
,
sweetheart
,
'
said
*NL*
I
;
`
what
do
ye
want
?
'
'
I
want
room
for
two
passengers
,
'
says
she
.
*NL*
`
Where
are
they
,
sweetheart
?
'
said
I.
`
Here
's
this
girl
,
pray
let
her
*NL*
go
into
the
coach
,
'
says
she
,
`
and
I
'll
go
and
fetch
my
mistress
.
'
*NL*
`
Make
haste
,
then
,
sweetheart
,
'
says
I
,
`
for
we
may
be
full
else
.
'
The
*NL*
maid
had
a
great
bundle
under
her
arm
;
so
she
put
the
child
into
the
*NL*
coach
,
and
I
said
,
`
You
had
best
put
your
bundle
into
the
coach
too
.
'
*NL*
`
No
,
'
says
she
,
'
I
am
afraid
somebody
should
slip
it
away
from
the
*NL*
child
.
'
`
Give
to
me
,
then
,
'
said
I
,
`
and
I
'll
take
care
of
it
.
'
`
Do
,
*NL*
then
,
'
says
she
,
`
and
be
sure
you
take
of
it
.
'
`
I
'll
answer
for
it
,
'
*NL*
said
I
,
`
if
it
were
for
#
20
value
.
'
`
There
,
take
it
,
then
,
'
says
she
,
*NL*
and
away
she
goes
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
I
had
got
the
bundle
,
and
the
maid
was
out
of
sight
,
I
goes
*NL*
on
towards
the
alehouse
,
where
the
porter
's
wife
was
,
so
that
if
I
had
*NL*
met
her
,
I
had
then
only
been
going
to
give
her
the
bundle
,
and
to
call
*NL*
her
to
her
business
,
as
if
I
was
going
away
,
and
could
stay
no
longer
;
*NL*
but
as
I
did
not
meet
her
,
I
walked
away
,
and
turning
into
Charterhouse
*NL*
Lane
,
then
crossed
into
Batholomew
Close
,
so
into
Little
Britain
,
and
*NL*
through
the
Bluecoat
Hospital
,
into
Newgate
Street
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
prevent
my
being
known
,
I
pulled
off
my
blue
apron
,
and
wrapped
the
*NL*
bundle
in
it
,
which
before
was
made
up
in
a
piece
of
painted
calico
,
*NL*
and
very
remarkable
;
I
also
wrapped
up
my
straw
hat
in
it
,
and
so
put
*NL*
the
bundle
upon
my
head
;
and
it
was
very
well
that
I
did
thus
,
for
*NL*
coming
through
the
Bluecoat
Hospital
,
who
should
I
meet
but
the
wench
*NL*
that
had
given
me
the
bundle
to
hold
.
It
seems
she
was
going
with
her
*NL*
mistress
,
whom
she
had
been
gone
to
fetch
,
to
the
Barnet
coaches
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
saw
she
was
in
haste
,
and
I
had
no
business
to
stop
her
;
so
away
she
*NL*
went
,
and
I
brought
my
bundle
safe
home
to
my
governess
.
There
was
no
*NL*
money
,
nor
plate
,
or
jewels
in
the
bundle
,
but
a
very
good
suit
of
*NL*
Indian
damask
,
a
gown
and
a
petticoat
,
a
laced-head
and
ruffles
of
very
*NL*
good
Flanders
lace
,
and
some
linen
and
other
things
,
such
as
I
knew
*NL*
very
well
the
value
of
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
not
indeed
my
own
invention
,
but
was
given
me
by
one
that
had
*NL*
practised
it
with
success
,
and
my
governess
liked
it
extremely
;
and
*NL*
indeed
I
tried
it
again
several
times
,
though
never
twice
near
the
same
*NL*
place
;
for
the
next
time
I
tried
it
in
White
Chapel
,
just
by
the
corner
*NL*
of
Petticoat
Lane
,
where
the
coaches
stand
that
go
out
to
Stratford
and
*NL*
Bow
,
and
that
side
of
the
country
,
and
another
time
at
the
Flying
*NL*
Horse
,
without
Bishopgate
,
where
the
Cheston
coaches
then
lay
;
and
I
*NL*
had
always
the
good
luck
to
come
off
with
some
booty
.
*NL*
*NL*
Another
time
I
placed
myself
at
a
warehouse
by
the
waterside
,
where
the
*NL*
coasting
vessels
from
the
north
come
,
such
as
from
Newcastle-upon-Tyne
,
*NL*
Sunderland
,
and
other
places
.
Here
,
the
warehouses
being
shut
,
comes
a
*NL*
young
fellow
with
a
letter
;
and
he
wanted
a
box
and
a
hamper
that
was
*NL*
come
from
Newcastle-upon-Tyne
.
I
asked
him
if
he
had
the
marks
of
it
;
*NL*
so
he
shows
me
the
letter
,
by
virtue
of
which
he
was
to
ask
for
it
,
and
*NL*
which
gave
an
account
of
the
contents
,
the
box
being
full
of
linen
,
and
*NL*
the
hamper
full
of
glass
ware
.
I
read
the
letter
,
and
took
care
to
see
*NL*
the
name
,
and
the
marks
,
the
name
of
the
person
that
sent
the
goods
,
*NL*
the
name
of
the
person
that
they
were
sent
to
;
then
I
bade
the
*NL*
messenger
come
in
the
morning
,
for
that
the
warehouse-keeper
would
not
*NL*
be
there
any
more
that
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
Away
went
I
,
and
getting
materials
in
a
public
house
,
I
wrote
a
letter
*NL*
from
Mr.
John
Richardson
of
Newcastle
to
his
dear
cousin
Jemmy
Cole
,
in
*NL*
London
,
with
an
account
that
he
sent
by
such
a
vessel
-LRB-
for
I
remembered
*NL*
all
the
particulars
to
a
title
-RRB-
,
so
many
pieces
of
huckaback
linen
,
so
*NL*
many
ells
of
Dutch
holland
and
the
like
,
in
a
box
,
and
a
hamper
of
*NL*
flint
glasses
from
Mr.
Henzill
's
glasshouse
;
and
that
the
box
was
*NL*
marked
I.
C.
No.
1
,
and
the
hamper
was
directed
by
a
label
on
the
*NL*
cording
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
an
hour
after
,
I
came
to
the
warehouse
,
found
the
*NL*
warehouse-keeper
,
and
had
the
goods
delivered
me
without
any
scruple
;
*NL*
the
value
of
the
linen
being
about
#
22
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
fill
up
this
whole
discourse
with
the
variety
of
such
*NL*
adventures
,
which
daily
invention
directed
to
,
and
which
I
managed
with
*NL*
the
utmost
dexterity
,
and
always
with
success
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
--
as
when
does
the
pitcher
come
safe
home
that
goes
so
very
*NL*
often
to
the
well
?
--
I
fell
into
some
small
broils
,
which
though
they
*NL*
could
not
affect
me
fatally
,
yet
made
me
known
,
which
was
the
worst
*NL*
thing
next
to
being
found
guilty
that
could
befall
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
taken
up
the
disguise
of
a
widow
's
dress
;
it
was
without
any
real
*NL*
design
in
view
,
but
only
waiting
for
anything
that
might
offer
,
as
I
*NL*
often
did
.
It
happened
that
while
I
was
going
along
the
street
in
*NL*
Covent
Garden
,
there
was
a
great
cry
of
`
Stop
thief
!
Stop
thief
!
'
some
*NL*
artists
had
,
it
seems
,
put
a
trick
upon
a
shopkeeper
,
and
being
*NL*
pursued
,
some
of
them
fled
one
way
,
and
some
another
;
and
one
of
them
*NL*
was
,
they
said
,
dressed
up
in
widow
's
weeds
,
upon
which
the
mob
*NL*
gathered
about
me
,
and
some
said
I
was
the
person
,
others
said
no
.
*NL*
Immediately
came
the
mercer
's
journeyman
,
and
he
swore
aloud
I
was
the
*NL*
person
,
and
so
seized
on
me
.
However
,
when
I
was
brought
back
by
the
*NL*
mob
to
the
mercer
's
shop
,
the
master
of
the
house
said
freely
that
I
*NL*
was
not
the
woman
that
was
in
his
shop
,
and
would
have
let
me
go
*NL*
immediately
;
but
another
fellow
said
gravely
,
`
Pray
stay
till
Mr.
--
'
*NL*
-LRB-
meaning
the
journeyman
-RRB-
`
comes
back
,
for
he
knows
her
.
'
So
they
kept
*NL*
me
by
force
near
half
an
hour
.
They
had
called
a
constable
,
and
he
*NL*
stood
in
the
shop
as
my
jailer
;
and
in
talking
with
the
constable
I
*NL*
inquired
where
he
lived
,
and
what
trade
he
was
;
the
man
not
*NL*
apprehending
in
the
least
what
happened
afterwards
,
readily
told
me
his
*NL*
name
,
and
trade
,
and
where
he
lived
;
and
told
me
as
a
jest
,
that
I
*NL*
might
be
sure
to
hear
of
his
name
when
I
came
to
the
Old
Bailey
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
of
the
servants
likewise
used
me
saucily
,
and
had
much
ado
to
keep
*NL*
their
hands
off
me
;
the
master
indeed
was
civiller
to
me
than
they
,
but
*NL*
he
would
not
yet
let
me
go
,
though
he
owned
he
could
not
say
I
was
in
*NL*
his
shop
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
began
to
be
a
little
surly
with
him
,
and
told
him
I
hoped
he
would
*NL*
not
take
it
ill
if
I
made
myself
amends
upon
him
in
a
more
legal
way
*NL*
another
time
;
and
desired
I
might
send
for
friends
to
see
me
have
right
*NL*
done
me
.
No
,
he
said
,
he
could
give
no
such
liberty
;
I
might
ask
it
*NL*
when
I
came
before
the
justice
of
peace
;
and
seeing
I
threatened
him
,
*NL*
he
would
take
care
of
me
in
the
meantime
,
and
would
lodge
me
safe
in
*NL*
Newgate
.
I
told
him
it
was
his
time
now
,
but
it
would
be
mine
by
and
*NL*
by
,
and
governed
my
passion
as
well
as
I
was
able
.
However
,
I
spoke
to
*NL*
the
constable
to
call
me
a
porter
,
which
he
did
,
and
then
I
called
for
*NL*
pen
,
ink
,
and
paper
,
but
they
would
let
me
have
none
.
I
asked
the
*NL*
porter
his
name
,
and
where
he
lived
,
and
the
poor
man
told
it
me
very
*NL*
willingly
.
I
bade
him
observe
and
remember
how
I
was
treated
there
;
*NL*
that
he
saw
I
was
detained
there
by
force
.
I
told
him
I
should
want
*NL*
his
evidence
in
another
place
,
and
it
should
not
be
the
worse
for
him
*NL*
to
speak
.
The
porter
said
he
would
serve
me
with
all
his
heart
.
`
But
,
*NL*
madam
,
'
says
he
,
`
let
me
hear
them
refuse
to
let
you
go
,
then
I
may
be
*NL*
able
to
speak
the
plainer
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
With
that
I
spoke
aloud
to
the
master
of
the
shop
,
and
said
,
`
Sir
,
you
*NL*
know
in
your
own
conscience
that
I
am
not
the
person
you
look
for
,
and
*NL*
that
I
was
not
in
your
shop
before
,
therefore
I
demand
that
you
detain
*NL*
me
here
no
longer
,
or
tell
me
the
reason
of
your
stopping
me
.
'
The
*NL*
fellow
grew
surlier
upon
this
than
before
,
and
said
he
would
do
neither
*NL*
till
he
thought
fit
.
`
Very
well
,
'
said
I
to
the
constable
and
to
the
*NL*
porter
;
`
you
will
be
pleased
to
remember
this
,
gentlemen
,
another
*NL*
time
.
'
The
porter
said
,
`
Yes
,
madam
'
;
and
the
constable
began
not
to
*NL*
like
it
,
and
would
have
persuaded
the
mercer
to
dismiss
him
,
and
let
me
*NL*
go
,
since
,
as
he
said
,
he
owned
I
was
not
the
person
.
`
Good
,
sir
,
'
*NL*
says
the
mercer
to
him
tauntingly
,
`
are
you
a
justice
of
peace
or
a
*NL*
constable
?
I
charged
you
with
her
;
pray
do
you
do
your
duty
.
'
The
*NL*
constable
told
him
,
a
little
moved
,
but
very
handsomely
,
'
I
know
my
*NL*
duty
,
and
what
I
am
,
sir
;
I
doubt
you
hardly
know
what
you
are
doing
.
'
*NL*
They
had
some
other
hard
words
,
and
in
the
meantime
the
journeyman
,
*NL*
impudent
and
unmanly
to
the
last
degree
,
used
me
barbarously
,
and
one
*NL*
of
them
,
the
same
that
first
seized
upon
me
,
pretended
he
would
search
*NL*
me
,
and
began
to
lay
hands
on
me
.
I
spit
in
his
face
,
called
out
to
*NL*
the
constable
,
and
bade
him
to
take
notice
of
my
usage
.
`
And
pray
,
Mr.
*NL*
Constable
,
'
said
I
,
`
ask
that
villain
's
name
,
'
pointing
to
the
man
.
*NL*
The
constable
reproved
him
decently
,
told
him
that
he
did
not
know
what
*NL*
he
did
,
for
he
knew
that
his
master
acknowledged
I
was
not
the
person
*NL*
that
was
in
his
shop
;
`
and
,
'
says
the
constable
,
'
I
am
afraid
your
*NL*
master
is
bringing
himself
,
and
me
too
,
into
trouble
,
if
this
*NL*
gentlewoman
comes
to
prove
who
she
is
,
and
where
she
was
,
and
it
*NL*
appears
that
she
is
not
the
woman
you
pretend
to
.
'
`
Damn
her
,
'
says
*NL*
the
fellow
again
,
with
a
impudent
,
hardened
face
,
`
she
is
the
lady
,
you
*NL*
may
depend
upon
it
;
I
'll
swear
she
is
the
same
body
that
was
in
the
*NL*
shop
,
and
that
I
gave
the
pieces
of
satin
that
is
lost
into
her
own
*NL*
hand
.
You
shall
hear
more
of
it
when
Mr.
William
and
Mr.
Anthony
*NL*
-LRB-
those
were
other
journeymen
-RRB-
come
back
;
they
will
know
her
again
as
*NL*
well
as
I.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Just
as
the
insolent
rogue
was
talking
thus
to
the
constable
,
comes
*NL*
back
Mr.
William
and
Mr.
Anthony
,
as
he
called
them
,
and
a
great
rabble
*NL*
with
them
,
bringing
along
with
them
the
true
widow
that
I
was
pretended
*NL*
to
be
;
and
they
came
sweating
and
blowing
into
the
shop
,
and
with
a
*NL*
great
deal
of
triumph
,
dragging
the
poor
creature
in
the
most
butcherly
*NL*
manner
up
towards
their
master
,
who
was
in
the
back
shop
,
and
cried
out
*NL*
aloud
,
`
Here
's
the
widow
,
sir
;
we
have
catched
her
at
last
.
'
`
What
do
*NL*
ye
mean
by
that
?
'
says
the
master
.
`
Why
,
we
have
her
already
;
there
*NL*
she
sits
,
'
says
he
,
`
and
Mr.
--
,
'
says
he
,
`
can
swear
this
is
she
.
'
*NL*
The
other
man
,
whom
they
called
Mr.
Anthony
,
replied
,
`
Mr.
--
may
say
*NL*
what
he
will
,
and
swear
what
he
will
,
but
this
is
the
woman
,
and
*NL*
there
's
the
remnant
of
satin
she
stole
;
I
took
it
out
of
her
clothes
*NL*
with
my
own
hand
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
sat
still
now
,
and
began
to
take
a
better
heart
,
but
smiled
and
said
*NL*
nothing
;
the
master
looked
pale
;
the
constable
turned
about
and
looked
*NL*
at
me
.
`
Let
'em
alone
,
Mr.
Constable
,
'
said
I
;
`
let
'em
go
on
.
'
The
*NL*
case
was
plain
and
could
not
be
denied
,
so
the
constable
was
charged
*NL*
with
the
right
thief
,
and
the
mercer
told
me
very
civilly
he
was
sorry
*NL*
for
the
mistake
,
and
hoped
I
would
not
take
it
ill
;
that
they
had
so
*NL*
many
things
of
this
nature
put
upon
them
every
day
,
that
they
could
not
*NL*
be
blamed
for
being
very
sharp
in
doing
themselves
justice
.
`
Not
take
*NL*
it
ill
,
sir
!
'
said
I
;
`
how
can
I
take
it
well
!
If
you
had
dismissed
me
*NL*
when
your
insolent
fellow
seized
on
me
it
the
street
,
and
brought
me
to
*NL*
you
,
and
when
you
yourself
acknowledged
I
was
not
the
person
,
I
would
*NL*
have
put
it
by
,
and
not
taken
it
ill
,
because
of
the
many
ill
things
I
*NL*
believe
you
have
put
upon
you
daily
;
but
your
treatment
of
me
since
has
*NL*
been
insufferable
,
and
especially
that
of
your
servant
;
I
must
and
will
*NL*
have
reparation
for
that
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
began
to
parley
with
me
,
said
he
would
make
me
any
reasonable
*NL*
satisfaction
,
and
would
fain
have
had
me
tell
him
what
it
was
I
*NL*
expected
.
I
told
him
that
I
should
not
be
my
own
judge
,
the
law
should
*NL*
decide
it
for
me
;
and
as
I
was
to
be
carried
before
a
magistrate
,
I
*NL*
should
let
him
hear
there
what
I
had
to
say
.
He
told
me
there
was
no
*NL*
occasion
to
go
before
the
justice
now
,
I
was
at
liberty
to
go
where
I
*NL*
pleased
;
and
so
,
calling
to
the
constable
,
told
him
he
might
let
me
go
,
*NL*
for
I
was
discharged
.
The
constable
said
calmly
to
him
,
`
sir
,
you
*NL*
asked
me
just
now
if
I
knew
whether
I
was
a
constable
or
justice
,
and
*NL*
bade
me
do
my
duty
,
and
charged
me
with
this
gentlewoman
as
a
prisoner
.
*NL*
Now
,
sir
,
I
find
you
do
not
understand
what
is
my
duty
,
for
you
would
*NL*
make
me
a
justice
indeed
;
but
I
must
tell
you
it
is
not
in
my
power
.
I
*NL*
may
keep
a
prisoner
when
I
am
charged
with
him
,
but
't
is
the
law
and
*NL*
the
magistrate
alone
that
can
discharge
that
prisoner
;
therefore
't
is
a
*NL*
mistake
,
sir
;
I
must
carry
her
before
a
justice
now
,
whether
you
think
*NL*
well
of
it
or
not
.
'
The
mercer
was
very
high
with
the
constable
at
*NL*
first
;
but
the
constable
happening
to
be
not
a
hired
officer
,
but
a
*NL*
good
,
substantial
kind
of
man
-LRB-
I
think
he
was
a
corn-handler
-RRB-
,
and
a
*NL*
man
of
good
sense
,
stood
to
his
business
,
would
not
discharge
me
*NL*
without
going
to
a
justice
of
the
peace
;
and
I
insisted
upon
it
too
.
*NL*
When
the
mercer
saw
that
,
`
Well
,
'
says
he
to
the
constable
,
`
you
may
*NL*
carry
her
where
you
please
;
I
have
nothing
to
say
to
her
.
'
`
But
,
sir
,
'
*NL*
says
the
constable
,
`
you
will
go
with
us
,
I
hope
,
for
't
is
you
that
*NL*
charged
me
with
her
.
'
`
No
,
not
I
,
'
says
the
mercer
;
'
I
tell
you
I
have
*NL*
nothing
to
say
to
her
.
'
`
But
pray
,
sir
,
do
,
'
says
the
constable
;
'
I
*NL*
desire
it
of
you
for
your
own
sake
,
for
the
justice
can
do
nothing
*NL*
without
you
.
'
`
Prithee
,
fellow
,
'
says
the
mercer
,
`
go
about
your
*NL*
business
;
I
tell
you
I
have
nothing
to
say
to
the
gentlewoman
.
I
*NL*
charge
you
in
the
king
's
name
to
dismiss
her
.
'
`
Sir
,
'
says
the
*NL*
constable
,
'
I
find
you
do
n't
know
what
it
is
to
be
constable
;
I
beg
of
*NL*
you
do
n't
oblige
me
to
be
rude
to
you
.
'
'
I
think
I
need
not
;
you
are
*NL*
rude
enough
already
,
'
says
the
mercer
.
`
No
,
sir
,
'
says
the
constable
,
*NL*
'
I
am
not
rude
;
you
have
broken
the
peace
in
bringing
an
honest
woman
*NL*
out
of
the
street
,
when
she
was
about
her
lawful
occasion
,
confining
*NL*
her
in
your
shop
,
and
ill-using
her
here
by
your
servants
;
and
now
can
*NL*
you
say
I
am
rude
to
you
?
I
think
I
am
civil
to
you
in
not
commanding
*NL*
or
charging
you
in
the
king
's
name
to
go
with
me
,
and
charging
every
*NL*
man
I
see
that
passes
your
door
to
aid
and
assist
me
in
carrying
you
by
*NL*
force
;
this
you
can
not
but
know
I
have
power
to
do
,
and
yet
I
forbear
*NL*
it
,
and
once
more
entreat
you
to
go
with
me
.
'
Well
,
he
would
not
for
*NL*
all
this
,
and
gave
the
constable
ill
language
.
However
,
the
constable
*NL*
kept
his
temper
,
and
would
not
be
provoked
;
and
then
I
put
in
and
said
,
*NL*
`
Come
,
Mr.
Constable
,
let
him
alone
;
I
shall
find
ways
enough
to
fetch
*NL*
him
before
a
magistrate
,
I
do
n't
fear
that
;
but
there
's
the
fellow
,
'
*NL*
says
I
,
`
he
was
the
man
that
seized
on
me
as
I
was
innocently
going
*NL*
along
the
street
,
and
you
are
a
witness
of
the
violence
with
me
since
;
*NL*
give
me
leave
to
charge
you
with
him
,
and
carry
him
before
the
*NL*
justice
.
'
`
Yes
,
madam
,
'
says
the
constable
;
and
turning
to
the
fellow
*NL*
`
Come
,
young
gentleman
,
'
says
he
to
the
journeyman
,
`
you
must
go
along
*NL*
with
us
;
I
hope
you
are
not
above
the
constable
's
power
,
though
your
*NL*
master
is
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
fellow
looked
like
a
condemned
thief
,
and
hung
back
,
then
looked
at
*NL*
his
master
,
as
if
he
could
help
him
;
and
he
,
like
a
fool
,
encourage
the
*NL*
fellow
to
be
rude
,
and
he
truly
resisted
the
constable
,
and
pushed
him
*NL*
back
with
a
good
force
when
he
went
to
lay
hold
on
him
,
at
which
the
*NL*
constable
knocked
him
down
,
and
called
out
for
help
;
and
immediately
*NL*
the
shop
was
filled
with
people
,
and
the
constable
seized
the
master
*NL*
and
man
,
and
all
his
servants
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
first
ill
consequence
of
this
fray
was
,
that
the
woman
they
had
*NL*
taken
,
who
was
really
the
thief
,
made
off
,
and
got
clear
away
in
the
*NL*
crowd
;
and
two
other
that
they
had
stopped
also
;
whether
they
were
*NL*
really
guilty
or
not
,
that
I
can
say
nothing
to
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
this
time
some
of
his
neighbours
having
come
in
,
and
,
upon
inquiry
,
*NL*
seeing
how
things
went
,
had
endeavoured
to
bring
the
hot-brained
mercer
*NL*
to
his
senses
,
and
he
began
to
be
convinced
that
he
was
in
the
wrong
;
*NL*
and
so
at
length
we
went
all
very
quietly
before
the
justice
,
with
a
*NL*
mob
of
about
five
hundred
people
at
our
heels
;
and
all
the
way
I
went
I
*NL*
could
hear
the
people
ask
what
was
the
matter
,
and
other
reply
and
say
,
*NL*
a
mercer
had
stopped
a
gentlewoman
instead
of
a
thief
,
and
had
*NL*
afterwards
taken
the
thief
,
and
now
the
gentlewoman
had
taken
the
*NL*
mercer
,
and
was
carrying
him
before
the
justice
.
This
pleased
the
*NL*
people
strangely
,
and
made
the
crowd
increase
,
and
they
cried
out
as
*NL*
they
went
,
`
Which
is
the
rogue
?
which
is
the
mercer
?
'
and
especially
*NL*
the
women
.
Then
when
they
saw
him
they
cried
out
,
`
That
's
he
,
that
's
*NL*
he
'
;
and
every
now
and
then
came
a
good
dab
of
dirt
at
him
;
and
thus
we
*NL*
marched
a
good
while
,
till
the
mercer
thought
fit
to
desire
the
*NL*
constable
to
call
a
coach
to
protect
himself
from
the
rabble
;
so
we
*NL*
rode
the
rest
of
the
way
,
the
constable
and
I
,
and
the
mercer
and
his
*NL*
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
came
to
the
justice
,
which
was
an
ancient
gentleman
in
*NL*
Bloomsbury
,
the
constable
giving
first
a
summary
account
of
the
matter
,
*NL*
the
justice
bade
me
speak
,
and
tell
what
I
had
to
say
.
And
first
he
*NL*
asked
my
name
,
which
I
was
very
loth
to
give
,
but
there
was
no
remedy
,
*NL*
so
I
told
him
my
name
was
Mary
Flanders
,
that
I
was
a
widow
,
my
husband
*NL*
being
a
sea
captain
,
died
on
a
voyage
to
Virginia
;
and
some
other
*NL*
circumstances
I
told
which
he
could
never
contradict
,
and
that
I
lodged
*NL*
at
present
in
town
with
such
a
person
,
naming
my
governess
;
but
that
I
*NL*
was
preparing
to
go
over
to
America
,
where
my
husband
's
effects
lay
,
*NL*
and
that
I
was
going
that
day
to
buy
some
clothes
to
put
myself
into
*NL*
second
mourning
,
but
had
not
yet
been
in
any
shop
,
when
that
fellow
,
*NL*
pointing
to
the
mercer
's
journeyman
,
came
rushing
upon
me
with
such
*NL*
fury
as
very
much
frighted
me
,
and
carried
me
back
to
his
master
's
*NL*
shop
,
where
,
though
his
master
acknowledged
I
was
not
the
person
,
yet
*NL*
he
would
not
dismiss
me
,
but
charged
a
constable
with
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
I
proceeded
to
tell
how
the
journeyman
treated
me
;
how
they
would
*NL*
not
suffer
me
to
send
for
any
of
my
friends
;
how
afterwards
they
found
*NL*
the
real
thief
,
and
took
the
very
goods
they
had
lost
upon
her
,
and
all
*NL*
the
particulars
as
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
the
constable
related
his
case
:
his
dialogue
with
the
mercer
*NL*
about
discharging
me
,
and
at
last
his
servant
's
refusing
to
go
with
*NL*
him
,
when
he
had
charged
him
with
him
,
and
his
master
encouraging
him
*NL*
to
do
so
,
and
at
last
his
striking
the
constable
,
and
the
like
,
all
as
*NL*
I
have
told
it
already
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
justice
then
heard
the
mercer
and
his
man
.
The
mercer
indeed
made
*NL*
a
long
harangue
of
the
great
loss
they
have
daily
by
lifters
and
*NL*
thieves
;
that
it
was
easy
for
them
to
mistake
,
and
that
when
he
found
*NL*
it
he
would
have
dismissed
me
,
etc.
,
as
above
.
As
to
the
journeyman
,
*NL*
he
had
very
little
to
say
,
but
that
he
pretended
other
of
the
servants
*NL*
told
him
that
I
was
really
the
person
.
*NL*
*NL*
Upon
the
whole
,
the
justice
first
of
all
told
me
very
courteously
I
was
*NL*
discharged
;
that
he
was
very
sorry
that
the
mercer
's
man
should
in
his
*NL*
eager
pursuit
have
so
little
discretion
as
to
take
up
an
innocent
*NL*
person
for
a
guilty
person
;
that
if
he
had
not
been
so
unjust
as
to
*NL*
detain
me
afterward
,
he
believed
I
would
have
forgiven
the
first
*NL*
affront
;
that
,
however
,
it
was
not
in
his
power
to
award
me
any
*NL*
reparation
for
anything
,
other
than
by
openly
reproving
them
,
which
he
*NL*
should
do
;
but
he
supposed
I
would
apply
to
such
methods
as
the
law
*NL*
directed
;
in
the
meantime
he
would
bind
him
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
as
to
the
breach
of
the
peace
committed
by
the
journeyman
,
he
told
*NL*
me
he
should
give
me
some
satisfaction
for
that
,
for
he
should
commit
*NL*
him
to
Newgate
for
assaulting
the
constable
,
and
for
assaulting
me
also
.
*NL*
*NL*
Accordingly
he
sent
the
fellow
to
Newgate
for
that
assault
,
and
his
*NL*
master
gave
bail
,
and
so
we
came
away
;
but
I
had
the
satisfaction
of
*NL*
seeing
the
mob
wait
upon
them
both
,
as
they
came
out
,
hallooing
and
*NL*
throwing
stones
and
dirt
at
the
coaches
they
rode
in
;
and
so
I
came
*NL*
home
to
my
governess
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
this
hustle
,
coming
home
and
telling
my
governess
the
story
,
she
*NL*
falls
a-laughing
at
me
.
`
Why
are
you
merry
?
'
says
I
;
`
the
story
has
*NL*
not
so
much
laughing
room
in
it
as
you
imagine
;
I
am
sure
I
have
had
a
*NL*
great
deal
of
hurry
and
fright
too
,
with
a
pack
of
ugly
rogues
.
'
*NL*
`
Laugh
!
'
says
my
governess
;
'
I
laugh
,
child
,
to
see
what
a
lucky
*NL*
creature
you
are
;
why
,
this
job
will
be
the
best
bargain
to
you
that
*NL*
ever
you
made
in
your
life
,
if
you
manage
it
well
.
I
warrant
you
,
'
*NL*
says
she
,
`
you
shall
make
the
mercer
pay
you
#
500
for
damages
,
besides
*NL*
what
you
shall
get
out
of
the
journeyman
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
other
thoughts
of
the
matter
than
she
had
;
and
especially
,
*NL*
because
I
had
given
in
my
name
to
the
justice
of
peace
;
and
I
knew
that
*NL*
my
name
was
so
well
known
among
the
people
at
Hick
's
Hall
,
the
Old
*NL*
Bailey
,
and
such
places
,
that
if
this
cause
came
to
be
tried
openly
,
*NL*
and
my
name
came
to
be
inquired
into
,
no
court
would
give
much
damages
,
*NL*
for
the
reputation
of
a
person
of
such
a
character
.
However
,
I
was
*NL*
obliged
to
begin
a
prosecution
in
form
,
and
accordingly
my
governess
*NL*
found
me
out
a
very
creditable
sort
of
a
man
to
manage
it
,
being
an
*NL*
attorney
of
very
good
business
,
and
of
a
good
reputation
,
and
she
was
*NL*
certainly
in
the
right
of
this
;
for
had
she
employed
a
pettifogging
*NL*
hedge
solicitor
,
or
a
man
not
known
,
and
not
in
good
reputation
,
I
*NL*
should
have
brought
it
to
but
little
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
met
this
attorney
,
and
gave
him
all
the
particulars
at
large
,
as
they
*NL*
are
recited
above
;
and
he
assured
me
it
was
a
case
,
as
he
said
,
that
*NL*
would
very
well
support
itself
,
and
that
he
did
not
question
but
that
a
*NL*
jury
would
give
very
considerable
damages
on
such
an
occasion
;
so
*NL*
taking
his
full
instructions
he
began
the
prosecution
,
and
the
mercer
*NL*
being
arrested
,
gave
bail
.
A
few
days
after
his
giving
bail
,
he
comes
*NL*
with
his
attorney
to
my
attorney
,
to
let
him
know
that
he
desired
to
*NL*
accommodate
the
matter
;
that
it
was
all
carried
on
in
the
heat
of
an
*NL*
unhappy
passion
;
that
his
client
,
meaning
me
,
had
a
sharp
provoking
*NL*
tongue
,
that
I
used
them
ill
,
gibing
at
them
,
and
jeering
them
,
even
*NL*
while
they
believed
me
to
be
the
very
person
,
and
that
I
had
provoked
*NL*
them
,
and
the
like
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
attorney
managed
as
well
on
my
side
;
made
them
believe
*NL*
I
was
a
widow
of
fortune
,
that
I
was
able
to
do
myself
justice
,
*NL*
and
had
great
friends
to
stand
by
me
too
,
who
had
all
made
me
promise
*NL*
to
sue
to
the
utmost
,
and
that
if
it
cost
me
a
thousand
pounds
I
would
*NL*
be
sure
to
have
satisfaction
,
for
that
the
affronts
I
had
received
were
*NL*
insufferable
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
they
brought
my
attorney
to
this
,
that
he
promised
he
would
*NL*
not
blow
the
coals
,
that
if
I
inclined
to
accommodation
,
he
would
not
*NL*
hinder
me
,
and
that
he
would
rather
persuade
me
to
peace
than
to
war
;
*NL*
for
which
they
told
him
he
should
be
no
loser
;
all
which
he
told
me
*NL*
very
honestly
,
and
told
me
that
if
they
offered
him
any
bribe
,
I
should
*NL*
certainly
know
it
;
but
upon
the
whole
he
told
me
very
honestly
that
if
*NL*
I
would
take
his
opinion
,
he
would
advise
me
to
make
it
up
with
them
,
*NL*
for
that
as
they
were
in
a
great
fright
,
and
were
desirous
above
all
*NL*
things
to
make
it
up
,
and
knew
that
,
let
it
be
what
it
would
,
they
*NL*
would
be
allotted
to
bear
all
the
costs
of
the
suit
;
he
believed
they
*NL*
would
give
me
freely
more
than
any
jury
or
court
of
justice
would
give
*NL*
upon
a
trial
.
I
asked
him
what
he
thought
they
would
be
brought
to
.
*NL*
He
told
me
he
could
not
tell
as
to
that
,
but
he
would
tell
me
more
when
*NL*
I
saw
him
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
time
after
this
,
they
came
again
to
know
if
he
had
talked
with
me
.
*NL*
He
told
them
he
had
;
that
he
found
me
not
so
averse
to
an
accommodation
*NL*
as
some
of
my
friends
were
,
who
resented
the
disgrace
offered
me
,
and
*NL*
set
me
on
;
that
they
blowed
the
coals
in
secret
,
prompting
me
to
*NL*
revenge
,
or
do
myself
justice
,
as
they
called
it
;
so
that
he
could
not
*NL*
tell
what
to
say
to
it
;
he
told
them
he
would
do
his
endeavour
to
*NL*
persuade
me
,
but
he
ought
to
be
able
to
tell
me
what
proposal
they
*NL*
made
.
They
pretended
they
could
not
make
any
proposal
,
because
it
*NL*
might
be
made
use
of
against
them
;
and
he
told
them
,
that
by
the
same
*NL*
rule
he
could
not
make
any
offers
,
for
that
might
be
pleaded
in
*NL*
abatement
of
what
damages
a
jury
might
be
inclined
to
give
.
However
,
*NL*
after
some
discourse
and
mutual
promises
that
no
advantage
should
be
*NL*
taken
on
either
side
,
by
what
was
transacted
then
or
at
any
other
of
*NL*
those
meetings
,
they
came
to
a
kind
of
a
treaty
;
but
so
remote
,
and
so
*NL*
wide
from
one
another
,
that
nothing
could
be
expected
from
it
;
for
my
*NL*
attorney
demanded
#
500
and
charges
,
and
they
offered
#
50
without
*NL*
charges
;
so
they
broke
off
,
and
the
mercer
proposed
to
have
a
meeting
*NL*
with
me
myself
;
and
my
attorney
agreed
to
that
very
readily
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
attorney
gave
me
notice
to
come
to
this
meeting
in
good
clothes
,
and
*NL*
with
some
state
,
that
the
mercer
might
see
I
was
something
more
than
I
*NL*
seemed
to
be
that
time
they
had
me
.
Accordingly
I
came
in
a
new
suit
*NL*
of
second
mourning
,
according
to
what
I
had
said
at
the
justice
's
.
I
*NL*
set
myself
out
,
too
,
as
well
as
a
widow
's
dress
in
second
mourning
*NL*
would
admit
;
my
governess
also
furnished
me
with
a
good
pearl
necklace
,
*NL*
that
shut
in
behind
with
a
locket
of
diamonds
,
which
she
had
in
pawn
;
*NL*
and
I
had
a
very
good
figure
;
and
as
I
stayed
till
I
was
sure
they
were
*NL*
come
,
I
came
in
a
coach
to
the
door
,
with
my
maid
with
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
came
into
the
room
the
mercer
was
surprised
.
He
stood
up
and
*NL*
made
his
bow
,
which
I
took
a
little
notice
of
,
and
but
a
little
,
and
*NL*
went
and
sat
down
where
my
own
attorney
had
pointed
to
me
to
sit
,
for
*NL*
it
was
his
house
.
After
a
little
while
the
mercer
said
,
he
did
not
*NL*
know
me
again
,
and
began
to
make
some
compliments
his
way
.
I
told
him
,
*NL*
I
believed
he
did
not
know
me
at
first
,
and
that
if
he
had
,
I
believed
*NL*
he
would
not
have
treated
me
as
he
did
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
told
me
he
was
very
sorry
for
what
had
happened
,
and
that
it
was
to
*NL*
testify
the
willingness
he
had
to
make
all
possible
reparation
that
he
*NL*
had
appointed
this
meeting
;
that
he
hoped
I
would
not
carry
things
to
*NL*
extremity
,
which
might
be
not
only
too
great
a
loss
to
him
,
but
might
*NL*
be
the
ruin
of
his
business
and
shop
,
in
which
case
I
might
have
the
*NL*
satisfaction
of
repaying
an
injury
with
an
injury
ten
times
greater
;
*NL*
but
that
I
would
then
get
nothing
,
whereas
he
was
willing
to
do
me
any
*NL*
justice
that
was
in
his
power
,
without
putting
himself
or
me
to
the
*NL*
trouble
or
charge
of
a
suit
at
law
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
told
him
I
was
glad
to
hear
him
talk
so
much
more
like
a
man
of
sense
*NL*
than
he
did
before
;
that
it
was
true
,
acknowledgment
in
most
cases
of
*NL*
affronts
was
counted
reparation
sufficient
;
but
this
had
gone
too
far
*NL*
to
be
made
up
so
;
that
I
was
not
revengeful
,
nor
did
I
seek
his
ruin
,
*NL*
or
any
man
's
else
,
but
that
all
my
friends
were
unanimous
not
to
let
me
*NL*
so
far
neglect
my
character
as
to
adjust
a
thing
of
this
kind
without
a
*NL*
sufficient
reparation
of
honour
;
that
to
be
taken
up
for
a
thief
was
*NL*
such
an
indignity
as
could
not
be
put
up
;
that
my
character
was
above
*NL*
being
treated
so
by
any
that
knew
me
,
but
because
in
my
condition
of
a
*NL*
widow
I
had
been
for
some
time
careless
of
myself
,
and
negligent
of
*NL*
myself
,
I
might
be
taken
for
such
a
creature
,
but
that
for
the
*NL*
particular
usage
I
had
from
him
afterwards
,
--
and
then
I
repeated
all
as
*NL*
before
;
it
was
so
provoking
I
had
scarce
patience
to
repeat
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
he
acknowledged
all
,
and
was
might
humble
indeed
;
he
made
*NL*
proposals
very
handsome
;
he
came
up
to
#
100
and
to
pay
all
the
law
*NL*
charges
,
and
added
that
he
would
make
me
a
present
of
a
very
good
suit
*NL*
of
clothes
.
I
came
down
to
#
300
,
and
I
demanded
that
I
should
publish
*NL*
an
advertisement
of
the
particulars
in
the
common
newspapers
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
a
clause
he
never
could
comply
with
.
However
,
at
last
he
came
*NL*
up
,
by
good
management
of
my
attorney
,
to
#
150
and
a
suit
of
black
silk
*NL*
clothes
;
and
there
I
agree
,
and
as
it
were
,
at
my
attorney
's
request
,
*NL*
complied
with
it
,
he
paying
my
attorney
's
bill
and
charges
,
and
gave
us
*NL*
a
good
supper
into
the
bargain
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
came
to
receive
the
money
,
I
brought
my
governess
with
me
,
*NL*
dressed
like
an
old
duchess
,
and
a
gentleman
very
well
dressed
,
who
we
*NL*
pretended
courted
me
,
but
I
called
him
cousin
,
and
the
lawyer
was
only
*NL*
to
hint
privately
to
him
that
his
gentleman
courted
the
widow
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
treated
us
handsomely
indeed
,
and
paid
the
money
cheerfully
enough
;
*NL*
so
that
it
cost
him
#
200
in
all
,
or
rather
more
.
At
our
last
meeting
,
*NL*
when
all
was
agreed
,
the
case
of
the
journeyman
came
up
,
and
the
mercer
*NL*
begged
very
hard
for
him
;
told
me
he
was
a
man
that
had
kept
a
shop
of
*NL*
his
own
,
and
been
in
good
business
,
had
a
wife
,
and
several
children
,
*NL*
and
was
very
poor
;
that
he
had
nothing
to
make
satisfaction
with
,
but
*NL*
he
should
come
to
beg
my
pardon
on
his
knees
,
if
I
desired
it
,
as
*NL*
openly
as
I
pleased
.
I
had
no
spleen
at
the
saucy
rogue
,
nor
were
his
*NL*
submissions
anything
to
me
,
since
there
was
nothing
to
be
got
by
him
,
*NL*
so
I
thought
it
was
as
good
to
throw
that
in
generously
as
not
;
so
I
*NL*
told
him
I
did
not
desire
the
ruin
of
any
man
,
and
therefore
at
his
*NL*
request
I
would
forgive
the
wretch
;
it
was
below
me
to
seek
any
revenge
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
were
at
supper
he
brought
the
poor
fellow
in
to
make
*NL*
acknowledgment
,
which
he
would
have
done
with
as
much
mean
humility
as
*NL*
his
offence
was
with
insulting
haughtiness
and
pride
,
in
which
he
was
*NL*
an
instance
of
a
complete
baseness
of
spirit
,
impious
,
cruel
,
and
*NL*
relentless
when
uppermost
and
in
prosperity
,
abject
and
low-spirited
*NL*
when
down
in
affliction
.
However
,
I
abated
his
cringes
,
told
him
I
*NL*
forgave
him
,
and
desired
he
might
withdraw
,
as
if
I
did
not
care
for
*NL*
the
sight
of
him
,
though
I
had
forgiven
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
now
in
good
circumstances
indeed
,
if
I
could
have
known
my
time
*NL*
for
leaving
off
,
and
my
governess
often
said
I
was
the
richest
of
the
*NL*
trade
in
England
;
and
so
I
believe
I
was
,
for
I
had
#
700
by
me
in
*NL*
money
,
besides
clothes
,
rings
,
some
plate
,
and
two
gold
watches
,
and
*NL*
all
of
them
stolen
,
for
I
had
innumerable
jobs
besides
these
I
have
*NL*
mentioned
.
Oh
!
had
I
even
now
had
the
grace
of
repentance
,
I
had
*NL*
still
leisure
to
have
looked
back
upon
my
follies
,
and
have
made
some
*NL*
reparation
;
but
the
satisfaction
I
was
to
make
for
the
public
mischiefs
*NL*
I
had
done
was
yet
left
behind
;
and
I
could
not
forbear
going
abroad
*NL*
again
,
as
I
called
it
now
,
than
any
more
I
could
when
my
extremity
*NL*
really
drove
me
out
for
bread
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
long
after
the
affair
with
the
mercer
was
made
up
,
that
I
*NL*
went
out
in
an
equipage
quite
different
from
any
I
had
ever
appeared
in
*NL*
before
.
I
dressed
myself
like
a
beggar
woman
,
in
the
coarsest
and
most
*NL*
despicable
rags
I
could
get
,
and
I
walked
about
peering
and
peeping
*NL*
into
every
door
and
window
I
came
near
;
and
indeed
I
was
in
such
a
*NL*
plight
now
that
I
knew
as
ill
how
to
behave
in
as
ever
I
did
in
any
.
I
*NL*
naturally
abhorred
dirt
and
rags
;
I
had
been
bred
up
tight
and
cleanly
,
*NL*
and
could
be
no
other
,
whatever
condition
I
was
in
;
so
that
this
was
*NL*
the
most
uneasy
disguise
to
me
that
ever
I
put
on
.
I
said
presently
to
*NL*
myself
that
this
would
not
do
,
for
this
was
a
dress
that
everybody
was
*NL*
shy
and
afraid
of
;
and
I
thought
everybody
looked
at
me
,
as
if
they
*NL*
were
afraid
I
should
come
near
them
,
lest
I
should
take
something
from
*NL*
them
,
or
afraid
to
come
near
me
,
lest
they
should
get
something
from
*NL*
me
.
I
wandered
about
all
the
evening
the
first
time
I
went
out
,
and
*NL*
made
nothing
of
it
,
but
came
home
again
wet
,
draggled
,
and
tired
.
*NL*
However
,
I
went
out
again
the
next
night
,
and
then
I
met
with
a
little
*NL*
adventure
,
which
had
like
to
have
cost
me
dear
.
As
I
was
standing
near
*NL*
a
tavern
door
,
there
comes
a
gentleman
on
horseback
,
and
lights
at
the
*NL*
door
,
and
wanting
to
go
into
the
tavern
,
he
calls
one
of
the
drawers
to
*NL*
hold
his
horse
.
He
stayed
pretty
long
in
the
tavern
,
and
the
drawer
*NL*
heard
his
master
call
,
and
thought
he
would
be
angry
with
him
.
Seeing
*NL*
me
stand
by
him
,
he
called
to
me
,
`
Here
,
woman
,
'
says
he
,
`
hold
this
*NL*
horse
a
while
,
till
I
go
in
;
if
the
gentleman
comes
,
he
'll
give
you
*NL*
something
.
'
`
Yes
,
'
says
I
,
and
takes
the
horse
,
and
walks
off
with
him
*NL*
very
soberly
,
and
carried
him
to
my
governess
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
had
been
a
booty
to
those
that
had
understood
it
;
but
never
was
*NL*
poor
thief
more
at
a
loss
to
know
what
to
do
with
anything
that
was
*NL*
stolen
;
for
when
I
came
home
,
my
governess
was
quite
confounded
,
and
*NL*
what
to
do
with
the
creature
,
we
neither
of
us
knew
.
To
send
him
to
a
*NL*
stable
was
doing
nothing
,
for
it
was
certain
that
public
notice
would
*NL*
be
given
in
the
Gazette
,
and
the
horse
described
,
so
that
we
durst
not
*NL*
go
to
fetch
it
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
remedy
we
had
for
this
unlucky
adventure
was
to
go
and
set
up
*NL*
the
horse
at
an
inn
,
and
send
a
note
by
a
porter
to
the
tavern
,
that
*NL*
the
gentleman
's
horse
that
was
lost
such
a
time
was
left
at
such
an
*NL*
inn
,
and
that
he
might
be
had
there
;
that
the
poor
woman
that
held
him
,
*NL*
having
led
him
about
the
street
,
not
being
able
to
lead
him
back
again
,
*NL*
had
left
him
there
.
We
might
have
waited
till
the
owner
had
published
*NL*
and
offered
a
reward
,
but
we
did
not
care
to
venture
the
receiving
the
*NL*
reward
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
this
was
a
robbery
and
no
robbery
,
for
little
was
lost
by
it
,
and
*NL*
nothing
was
got
by
it
,
and
I
was
quite
sick
of
going
out
in
a
beggar
's
*NL*
dress
;
it
did
not
answer
at
all
,
and
besides
,
I
thought
it
was
ominous
*NL*
and
threatening
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
I
was
in
this
disguise
,
I
fell
in
with
a
parcel
of
folks
of
a
*NL*
worse
kind
than
any
I
ever
sorted
with
,
and
I
saw
a
little
into
their
*NL*
ways
too
.
These
were
coiners
of
money
,
and
they
made
some
very
good
*NL*
offers
to
me
,
as
to
profit
;
but
the
part
they
would
have
had
me
have
*NL*
embarked
in
was
the
most
dangerous
part
.
I
mean
that
of
the
very
*NL*
working
the
die
,
as
they
call
it
,
which
,
had
I
been
taken
,
had
been
*NL*
certain
death
,
and
that
at
a
stake
--
I
say
,
to
be
burnt
to
death
at
a
*NL*
stake
;
so
that
though
I
was
to
appearance
but
a
beggar
,
and
they
*NL*
promised
mountains
of
gold
and
silver
to
me
to
engage
,
yet
it
would
not
*NL*
do
.
It
is
true
,
if
I
had
been
really
a
beggar
,
or
had
been
desperate
*NL*
as
when
I
began
,
I
might
perhaps
have
closed
with
it
;
for
what
care
*NL*
they
to
die
that
ca
n't
tell
how
to
live
?
But
at
present
this
was
not
*NL*
my
condition
,
at
least
I
was
for
no
such
terrible
risks
as
those
;
*NL*
besides
,
the
very
thoughts
of
being
burnt
at
a
stake
struck
terror
into
*NL*
my
very
soul
,
chilled
my
blood
,
and
gave
me
the
vapours
to
such
a
*NL*
degree
,
as
I
could
not
think
of
it
without
trembling
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
put
an
end
to
my
disguise
too
,
for
as
I
did
not
like
the
proposal
,
*NL*
so
I
did
not
tell
them
so
,
but
seemed
to
relish
it
,
and
promised
to
*NL*
meet
again
.
But
I
durst
see
them
no
more
;
for
if
I
had
seen
them
,
and
*NL*
not
complied
,
though
I
had
declined
it
with
the
greatest
assurance
of
*NL*
secrecy
in
the
world
,
they
would
have
gone
near
to
have
murdered
me
,
to
*NL*
make
sure
work
,
and
make
themselves
easy
,
as
they
call
it
.
What
kind
*NL*
of
easiness
that
is
,
they
may
best
judge
that
understand
how
easy
men
*NL*
are
that
can
murder
people
to
prevent
danger
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
and
horse-stealing
were
things
quite
out
of
my
way
,
and
I
might
*NL*
easily
resolve
I
would
have
to
more
to
say
to
them
;
my
business
seemed
*NL*
to
lie
another
way
,
and
though
it
had
hazard
enough
in
it
too
,
yet
it
*NL*
was
more
suitable
to
me
,
and
what
had
more
of
art
in
it
,
and
more
room
*NL*
to
escape
,
and
more
chances
for
a-coming
off
if
a
surprise
should
*NL*
happen
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
several
proposals
made
also
to
me
about
that
time
,
to
come
into
a
*NL*
gang
of
house-breakers
;
but
that
was
a
thing
I
had
no
mind
to
venture
*NL*
at
neither
,
any
more
than
I
had
at
the
coining
trade
.
I
offered
to
go
*NL*
along
with
two
men
and
a
woman
,
that
made
it
their
business
to
get
into
*NL*
houses
by
stratagem
,
and
with
them
I
was
willing
enough
to
venture
.
*NL*
But
there
were
three
of
them
already
,
and
they
did
not
care
to
part
,
*NL*
nor
I
to
have
too
many
in
a
gang
,
so
I
did
not
close
with
them
,
but
*NL*
declined
them
,
and
they
paid
dear
for
their
next
attempt
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
at
length
I
met
with
a
woman
that
had
often
told
me
what
adventures
*NL*
she
had
made
,
and
with
success
,
at
the
waterside
,
and
I
closed
with
*NL*
her
,
and
we
drove
on
our
business
pretty
well
.
One
day
we
came
among
*NL*
some
Dutch
people
at
St.
Catherine
's
,
where
we
went
on
pretence
to
buy
*NL*
goods
that
were
privately
got
on
shore
.
I
was
two
or
three
times
in
a
*NL*
house
where
we
saw
a
good
quantity
of
prohibited
goods
,
and
my
*NL*
companion
once
brought
away
three
pieces
of
Dutch
black
silk
that
*NL*
turned
to
good
account
,
and
I
had
my
share
of
it
;
but
in
all
the
*NL*
journeys
I
made
by
myself
,
I
could
not
get
an
opportunity
to
do
*NL*
anything
,
so
I
laid
it
aside
,
for
I
had
been
so
often
,
that
they
began
*NL*
to
suspect
something
,
and
were
so
shy
,
that
I
saw
nothing
was
to
be
*NL*
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
baulked
me
a
little
,
and
I
resolved
to
push
at
something
or
other
,
*NL*
for
I
was
not
used
to
come
back
so
often
without
purchase
;
so
the
next
*NL*
day
I
dressed
myself
up
fine
,
and
took
a
walk
to
the
other
end
of
the
*NL*
town
.
I
passed
through
the
Exchange
in
the
Strand
,
but
had
no
notion
*NL*
of
finding
anything
to
do
there
,
when
on
a
sudden
I
saw
a
great
*NL*
cluttering
in
the
place
,
and
all
the
people
,
shopkeepers
as
well
as
*NL*
others
,
standing
up
and
staring
;
and
what
should
it
be
but
some
great
*NL*
duchess
come
into
the
Exchange
,
and
they
said
the
queen
was
coming
.
I
*NL*
set
myself
close
up
to
a
shop-side
with
my
back
to
the
counter
,
as
if
*NL*
to
let
the
crowd
pass
by
,
when
keeping
my
eye
upon
a
parcel
of
lace
*NL*
which
the
shopkeeper
was
showing
to
some
ladies
that
stood
by
me
,
the
*NL*
shopkeeper
and
her
maid
were
so
taken
up
with
looking
to
see
who
was
*NL*
coming
,
and
what
shop
they
would
go
to
,
that
I
found
means
to
slip
a
*NL*
paper
of
lace
into
my
pocket
and
come
clear
off
with
it
;
so
the
*NL*
lady-milliner
paid
dear
enough
for
her
gaping
after
the
queen
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
went
off
from
the
shop
,
as
if
driven
along
by
the
throng
,
and
*NL*
mingling
myself
with
the
crowd
,
went
out
at
the
other
door
of
the
*NL*
Exchange
,
and
so
got
away
before
they
missed
their
lace
;
and
because
I
*NL*
would
not
be
followed
,
I
called
a
coach
and
shut
myself
up
in
it
.
I
*NL*
had
scarce
shut
the
coach
doors
up
,
but
I
saw
the
milliner
's
maid
and
*NL*
five
or
six
more
come
running
out
into
the
street
,
and
crying
out
as
if
*NL*
they
were
frightened
.
They
did
not
cry
`
Stop
thief
!
'
because
nobody
*NL*
ran
away
,
but
I
could
hear
the
word
`
robbed
,
'
and
`
lace
,
'
two
or
three
*NL*
times
,
and
saw
the
wench
wringing
her
hands
,
and
run
staring
to
and
*NL*
again
,
like
one
scared
.
The
coachman
that
had
taken
me
up
was
getting
*NL*
up
into
the
box
,
but
was
not
quite
up
,
so
that
the
horse
had
not
begun
*NL*
to
move
;
so
that
I
was
terrible
uneasy
,
and
I
took
the
packet
of
lace
*NL*
and
laid
it
ready
to
have
dropped
it
out
at
the
flap
of
the
coach
,
*NL*
which
opens
before
,
just
behind
the
coachman
;
but
to
my
great
*NL*
satisfaction
,
in
less
than
a
minute
the
coach
began
to
move
,
that
is
to
*NL*
say
,
as
soon
as
the
coachman
had
got
up
and
spoken
to
his
horses
;
so
he
*NL*
drove
away
without
any
interruption
,
and
I
brought
off
my
purchase
,
*NL*
which
was
work
near
#
20
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
I
dressed
up
again
,
but
in
quite
different
clothes
,
and
*NL*
walked
the
same
way
again
,
but
nothing
offered
till
I
came
into
St.
*NL*
James
's
Park
,
where
I
saw
abundance
of
fine
ladies
in
the
Park
,
walking
*NL*
in
the
Mall
,
and
among
the
rest
there
was
a
little
miss
,
a
young
lady
*NL*
of
about
twelve
or
thirteen
years
old
,
and
she
had
a
sister
,
as
I
*NL*
suppose
it
was
,
with
her
,
that
might
be
about
nine
years
old
.
I
*NL*
observed
the
biggest
had
a
fine
gold
watch
on
,
and
a
good
necklace
of
*NL*
pearl
,
and
they
had
a
footman
in
livery
with
them
;
but
as
it
is
not
*NL*
usual
for
the
footman
to
go
behind
the
ladies
in
the
Mall
,
so
I
*NL*
observed
the
footman
stopped
at
their
going
into
the
Mall
,
and
the
*NL*
biggest
of
the
sisters
spoke
to
him
,
which
I
perceived
was
to
bid
him
*NL*
be
just
there
when
they
came
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
heard
her
dismiss
the
footman
,
I
stepped
up
to
him
and
asked
*NL*
him
,
what
little
lady
that
was
?
and
held
a
little
chat
with
him
about
*NL*
what
a
pretty
child
it
was
with
her
,
and
how
genteel
and
well-carriaged
*NL*
the
lady
,
the
eldest
,
would
be
:
how
womanish
,
and
how
grave
;
and
the
*NL*
fool
of
a
fellow
told
me
presently
who
she
was
;
that
she
was
Sir
Thomas
*NL*
--
's
eldest
daughter
,
of
Essex
,
and
that
she
was
a
great
fortune
;
*NL*
that
her
mother
was
not
come
to
town
yet
;
but
she
was
with
Sir
William
*NL*
--
's
lady
,
of
Suffolk
,
at
her
lodging
in
Suffolk
Street
,
and
a
great
*NL*
deal
more
;
that
they
had
a
maid
and
a
woman
to
wait
on
them
,
besides
*NL*
Sir
Thomas
's
coach
,
the
coachman
,
and
himself
;
and
that
young
lady
was
*NL*
governess
to
the
whole
family
,
as
well
here
as
at
home
too
;
and
,
in
*NL*
short
,
told
me
abundance
of
things
enough
for
my
business
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
very
well
dressed
,
and
had
my
gold
watch
as
well
as
she
;
so
I
*NL*
left
the
footman
,
and
I
puts
myself
in
a
rank
with
this
young
lady
,
*NL*
having
stayed
till
she
had
taken
one
double
turn
in
the
Mall
,
and
was
*NL*
going
forward
again
;
by
and
by
I
saluted
her
by
her
name
,
with
the
*NL*
title
of
Lady
Betty
.
I
asked
her
when
she
heard
from
her
father
;
when
*NL*
my
lady
her
mother
would
be
in
town
,
and
how
she
did
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
talked
so
familiarly
to
her
of
her
whole
family
that
she
could
not
*NL*
suspect
but
that
I
knew
them
all
intimately
.
I
asked
her
why
she
would
*NL*
come
abroad
without
Mrs.
Chime
with
her
-LRB-
that
was
the
name
of
her
*NL*
woman
-RRB-
to
take
of
Mrs.
Judith
,
that
was
her
sister
.
Then
I
entered
*NL*
into
a
long
chat
with
her
about
her
sister
,
what
a
fine
little
lady
she
*NL*
was
,
and
asked
her
if
she
had
learned
French
,
and
a
thousand
such
*NL*
little
things
to
entertain
her
,
when
on
a
sudden
we
saw
the
guards
*NL*
come
,
and
the
crowd
ran
to
see
the
king
go
by
to
the
Parliament
House
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
ladies
ran
all
to
the
side
of
the
Mall
,
and
I
helped
my
lady
to
*NL*
stand
upon
the
edge
of
the
boards
on
the
side
of
the
Mall
,
that
she
*NL*
might
be
high
enough
to
see
;
and
took
the
little
one
and
lifted
her
*NL*
quite
up
;
during
which
,
I
took
care
to
convey
the
gold
watch
so
clean
*NL*
away
from
the
Lady
Betty
,
that
she
never
felt
it
,
nor
missed
it
,
till
*NL*
all
the
crowd
was
gone
,
and
she
was
gotten
into
the
middle
of
the
Mall
*NL*
among
the
other
ladies
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
took
my
leave
of
her
in
the
very
crowd
,
and
said
to
her
,
as
if
in
*NL*
haste
,
`
Dear
Lady
Betty
,
take
care
of
your
little
sister
.
'
And
so
the
*NL*
crowd
did
as
it
were
thrust
me
away
from
her
,
and
that
I
was
obliged
*NL*
unwillingly
to
take
my
leave
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
hurry
in
such
cases
is
immediately
over
,
and
the
place
clear
as
*NL*
soon
as
the
king
is
gone
by
;
but
as
there
is
always
a
great
running
and
*NL*
clutter
just
as
the
king
passes
,
so
having
dropped
the
two
little
*NL*
ladies
,
and
done
my
business
with
them
without
any
miscarriage
,
I
kept
*NL*
hurrying
on
among
the
crowd
,
as
if
I
ran
to
see
the
king
,
and
so
I
got
*NL*
before
the
crowd
and
kept
so
till
I
came
to
the
end
of
the
Mall
,
when
*NL*
the
king
going
on
towards
the
Horse
Guards
,
I
went
forward
to
the
*NL*
passage
,
which
went
then
through
against
the
lower
end
of
the
*NL*
Haymarket
,
and
there
I
bestowed
a
coach
upon
myself
,
and
made
off
,
and
*NL*
I
confess
I
have
not
yet
been
so
good
as
my
word
,
viz
.
to
go
and
visit
*NL*
my
Lady
Betty
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
once
of
the
mind
to
venture
staying
with
Lady
Betty
till
she
*NL*
missed
the
watch
,
and
so
have
made
a
great
outcry
about
it
with
her
,
*NL*
and
have
got
her
into
the
coach
,
and
put
myself
in
the
coach
with
her
,
*NL*
and
have
gone
home
with
her
;
for
she
appeared
so
fond
of
me
,
and
so
*NL*
perfectly
deceived
by
my
so
readily
talking
to
her
of
all
her
relations
*NL*
and
family
,
that
I
thought
it
was
very
easy
to
push
the
thing
farther
,
*NL*
and
to
have
got
at
least
the
necklace
of
pearl
;
but
when
I
considered
*NL*
that
though
the
child
would
not
perhaps
have
suspected
me
,
other
people
*NL*
might
,
and
that
if
I
was
searched
I
should
be
discovered
,
I
thought
it
*NL*
was
best
to
go
off
with
what
I
had
got
,
and
be
satisfied
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
came
accidentally
afterwards
to
hear
,
that
when
the
young
lady
missed
*NL*
her
watch
,
she
made
a
great
outcry
in
the
Park
,
and
sent
her
footman
up
*NL*
and
down
to
see
if
he
could
find
me
out
,
she
having
described
me
so
*NL*
perfectly
that
he
knew
presently
that
it
was
the
same
person
that
had
*NL*
stood
and
talked
so
long
with
him
,
and
asked
him
so
many
questions
*NL*
about
them
;
but
I
gone
far
enough
out
of
their
reach
before
she
could
*NL*
come
at
her
footman
to
tell
him
the
story
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
made
another
adventure
after
this
,
of
a
nature
different
from
all
I
*NL*
had
been
concerned
in
yet
,
and
this
was
at
a
gaming-house
near
Covent
*NL*
Garden
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
saw
several
people
go
in
and
out
;
and
I
stood
in
the
passage
a
good
*NL*
while
with
another
woman
with
me
,
and
seeing
a
gentleman
go
up
that
*NL*
seemed
to
be
of
more
than
ordinary
fashion
,
I
said
to
him
,
`
Sir
,
pray
*NL*
do
n't
they
give
women
leave
to
go
up
?
'
`
Yes
,
madam
,
'
says
he
,
`
and
to
*NL*
play
too
,
if
they
please
.
'
'
I
mean
so
,
sir
,
'
said
I.
And
with
that
he
*NL*
said
he
would
introduce
me
if
I
had
a
mind
;
so
I
followed
him
to
the
*NL*
door
,
and
he
looking
in
,
`
There
,
madam
,
'
says
he
,
`
are
the
gamesters
,
*NL*
if
you
have
a
mind
to
venture
.
'
I
looked
in
and
said
to
my
comrade
*NL*
aloud
,
`
Here
's
nothing
but
men
;
I
wo
n't
venture
among
them
.
'
At
which
*NL*
one
of
the
gentlemen
cried
out
,
`
You
need
not
be
afraid
,
madam
,
here
's
*NL*
none
but
fair
gamesters
;
you
are
very
welcome
to
come
and
set
what
you
*NL*
please
.
'
so
I
went
a
little
nearer
and
looked
on
,
and
some
of
them
*NL*
brought
me
a
chair
,
and
I
sat
down
and
saw
the
box
and
dice
go
round
*NL*
apace
;
then
I
said
to
my
comrade
,
`
The
gentlemen
play
too
high
for
us
;
*NL*
come
,
let
us
go
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
people
were
all
very
civil
,
and
one
gentleman
in
particular
*NL*
encouraged
me
,
and
said
,
`
Come
,
madam
,
if
you
please
to
venture
,
if
you
*NL*
dare
trust
me
,
I
'll
answer
for
it
you
shall
have
nothing
put
upon
you
*NL*
here
.
'
`
No
,
sir
,
'
said
I
,
smiling
,
'
I
hope
the
gentlemen
would
not
*NL*
cheat
a
woman
.
'
But
still
I
declined
venturing
,
though
I
pulled
out
a
*NL*
purse
with
money
in
it
,
that
they
might
see
I
did
not
want
money
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
I
had
sat
a
while
,
one
gentleman
said
to
me
,
jeering
,
`
Come
,
*NL*
madam
,
I
see
you
are
afraid
to
venture
for
yourself
;
I
always
had
good
*NL*
luck
with
the
ladies
,
you
shall
set
for
me
,
if
you
wo
n't
set
for
*NL*
yourself
.
'
I
told
him
,
`
sir
,
I
should
be
very
loth
to
lose
your
*NL*
money
,
'
though
I
added
,
'
I
am
pretty
lucky
too
;
but
the
gentlemen
play
*NL*
so
high
,
that
I
dare
not
indeed
venture
my
own
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
well
,
'
says
he
,
`
there
's
ten
guineas
,
madam
;
set
them
for
me
.
'
*NL*
so
I
took
his
money
and
set
,
himself
looking
on
.
I
ran
out
nine
of
the
*NL*
guineas
by
one
and
two
at
a
time
,
and
then
the
box
coming
to
the
next
*NL*
man
to
me
,
my
gentleman
gave
me
ten
guineas
more
,
and
made
me
set
five
*NL*
of
them
at
once
,
and
the
gentleman
who
had
the
box
threw
out
,
so
there
*NL*
was
five
guineas
of
his
money
again
.
He
was
encouraged
at
this
,
and
*NL*
made
me
take
the
box
,
which
was
a
bold
venture
.
However
,
I
held
the
*NL*
box
so
long
that
I
had
gained
him
his
whole
money
,
and
had
a
good
*NL*
handful
of
guineas
in
my
lap
,
and
which
was
the
better
luck
,
when
I
*NL*
threw
out
,
I
threw
but
at
one
or
two
of
those
that
had
set
me
,
and
so
*NL*
went
off
easy
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
was
come
this
length
,
I
offered
the
gentleman
all
the
gold
,
for
*NL*
it
was
his
own
;
and
so
would
have
had
him
play
for
himself
,
pretending
*NL*
I
did
not
understand
the
game
well
enough
.
He
laughed
,
and
said
if
I
*NL*
had
but
good
luck
,
it
was
no
matter
whether
I
understood
the
game
or
*NL*
no
;
but
I
should
not
leave
off
.
However
,
he
took
out
the
fifteen
*NL*
guineas
that
he
had
put
in
at
first
,
and
bade
me
play
with
the
rest
.
I
*NL*
would
have
told
them
to
see
how
much
I
had
got
,
but
he
said
,
`
No
,
no
,
*NL*
do
n't
tell
them
,
I
believe
you
are
very
honest
,
and
't
is
bad
luck
to
*NL*
tell
them
'
;
so
I
played
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
understood
the
game
well
enough
,
though
I
pretended
I
did
not
,
and
*NL*
played
cautiously
.
It
was
to
keep
a
good
stock
in
my
lap
,
out
of
which
*NL*
I
every
now
and
then
conveyed
some
into
my
pocket
,
but
in
such
a
*NL*
manner
,
and
at
such
convenient
times
,
as
I
was
sure
he
could
not
see
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
played
a
great
while
,
and
had
very
good
luck
for
him
;
but
the
last
*NL*
time
I
held
the
box
,
they
set
me
high
,
and
I
threw
boldly
at
all
;
I
*NL*
held
the
box
till
I
gained
near
fourscore
guineas
,
but
lost
above
half
*NL*
of
it
back
in
the
last
throw
;
so
I
got
up
,
for
I
was
afraid
I
should
*NL*
lose
it
all
back
again
,
and
said
to
him
,
`
Pray
come
,
sir
,
now
,
and
take
*NL*
it
and
play
for
yourself
;
I
think
I
have
done
pretty
well
for
you
.
'
He
*NL*
would
have
had
me
play
on
,
but
it
grew
late
,
and
I
desired
to
be
*NL*
excused
.
When
I
gave
it
up
to
him
,
I
told
him
I
hoped
he
would
give
me
*NL*
leave
to
tell
it
now
,
that
I
might
see
what
I
had
gained
,
and
how
lucky
*NL*
I
had
been
for
him
;
when
I
told
them
,
there
were
threescore
and
three
*NL*
guineas
.
`
Ay
,
'
says
I
,
`
if
it
had
not
been
for
that
unlucky
throw
,
I
*NL*
had
got
you
a
hundred
guineas
.
'
So
I
gave
him
all
the
money
,
but
he
*NL*
would
not
take
it
till
I
had
put
my
hand
into
it
,
and
taken
some
for
*NL*
myself
,
and
bid
me
please
myself
.
I
refused
it
,
and
was
positive
I
*NL*
would
not
take
it
myself
;
if
he
had
a
mind
to
anything
of
that
kind
,
it
*NL*
should
be
all
his
own
doings
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
rest
of
the
gentlemen
seeing
us
striving
cried
,
`
Give
it
her
all
'
;
*NL*
but
I
absolutely
refused
that
.
Then
one
of
them
said
,
'D
--
n
ye
,
jack
,
*NL*
halve
it
with
her
;
do
n't
you
know
you
should
be
always
upon
even
terms
*NL*
with
the
ladies
.
'
So
,
in
short
,
he
divided
it
with
me
,
and
I
brought
*NL*
away
thirty
guineas
,
besides
about
forty-three
which
I
had
stole
*NL*
privately
,
which
I
was
sorry
for
afterward
,
because
he
was
so
generous
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
I
brought
home
seventy-three
guineas
,
and
let
my
old
governess
see
*NL*
what
good
luck
I
had
at
play
.
However
,
it
was
her
advice
that
I
should
*NL*
not
venture
again
,
and
I
took
her
counsel
,
for
I
never
went
there
any
*NL*
more
;
for
I
knew
as
well
as
she
,
if
the
itch
of
play
came
in
,
I
might
*NL*
soon
lose
that
,
and
all
the
rest
of
what
I
had
got
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fortune
had
smiled
upon
me
to
that
degree
,
and
I
had
thriven
so
much
,
*NL*
and
my
governess
too
,
for
she
always
had
a
share
with
me
,
that
really
*NL*
the
old
gentlewoman
began
to
talk
of
leaving
off
while
we
were
well
,
*NL*
and
being
satisfied
with
what
we
had
got
;
but
,
I
know
not
what
fate
*NL*
guided
me
,
I
was
as
backward
to
it
now
as
she
was
when
I
proposed
it
to
*NL*
her
before
,
and
so
in
an
ill
hour
we
gave
over
the
thoughts
of
it
for
*NL*
the
present
,
and
,
in
a
word
,
I
grew
more
hardened
and
audacious
than
*NL*
ever
,
and
the
success
I
had
made
my
name
as
famous
as
any
thief
of
my
*NL*
sort
ever
had
been
at
Newgate
,
and
in
the
Old
Bailey
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
sometime
taken
the
liberty
to
play
the
same
game
over
again
,
*NL*
which
is
not
according
to
practice
,
which
however
succeeded
not
amiss
;
*NL*
but
generally
I
took
up
new
figures
,
and
contrived
to
appear
in
new
*NL*
shapes
every
time
I
went
abroad
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
a
rumbling
time
of
the
year
,
and
the
gentlemen
being
most
of
*NL*
them
gone
out
of
town
,
Tunbridge
,
and
Epsom
,
and
such
places
were
full
*NL*
of
people
.
But
the
city
was
thin
,
and
I
thought
our
trade
felt
it
a
*NL*
little
,
as
well
as
other
;
so
that
at
the
latter
end
of
the
year
I
*NL*
joined
myself
with
a
gang
who
usually
go
every
year
to
Stourbridge
*NL*
Fair
,
and
from
thence
to
Bury
Fair
,
in
Suffolk
.
We
promised
ourselves
*NL*
great
things
there
,
but
when
I
came
to
see
how
things
were
,
I
was
weary
*NL*
of
it
presently
;
for
except
mere
picking
of
pockets
,
there
was
little
*NL*
worth
meddling
with
;
neither
,
if
a
booty
had
been
made
,
was
it
so
easy
*NL*
carrying
it
off
,
nor
was
there
such
a
variety
of
occasion
for
business
*NL*
in
our
way
,
as
in
London
;
all
that
I
made
of
the
whole
journey
was
a
*NL*
gold
watch
at
Bury
Fair
,
and
a
small
parcel
of
linen
at
Cambridge
,
*NL*
which
gave
me
an
occasion
to
take
leave
of
the
place
.
It
was
on
old
*NL*
bite
,
and
I
thought
might
do
with
a
country
shopkeeper
,
though
in
*NL*
London
it
would
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
bought
at
a
linen-draper
's
shop
,
not
in
the
fair
,
but
in
the
town
of
*NL*
Cambridge
,
as
much
fine
holland
and
other
things
as
came
to
about
seven
*NL*
pounds
;
when
I
had
done
,
I
bade
them
be
sent
to
such
an
inn
,
where
I
*NL*
had
purposely
taken
up
my
being
the
same
morning
,
as
if
I
was
to
lodge
*NL*
there
that
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
ordered
the
draper
to
send
them
home
to
me
,
about
such
an
hour
,
to
*NL*
the
inn
where
I
lay
,
and
I
would
pay
him
his
money
.
At
the
time
*NL*
appointed
the
draper
sends
the
goods
,
and
I
placed
one
of
our
gang
at
*NL*
the
chamber
door
,
and
when
the
innkeeper
's
maid
brought
the
messenger
*NL*
to
the
door
,
who
was
a
young
fellow
,
an
apprentice
,
almost
a
man
,
she
*NL*
tells
him
her
mistress
was
asleep
,
but
if
he
would
leave
the
things
and
*NL*
call
in
about
an
hour
,
I
should
be
awake
,
and
he
might
have
the
money
.
*NL*
He
left
the
parcel
very
readily
,
and
goes
his
way
,
and
in
about
half
an
*NL*
hour
my
maid
and
I
walked
off
,
and
that
very
evening
I
hired
a
horse
,
*NL*
and
a
man
to
ride
before
me
,
and
went
to
Newmarket
,
and
from
thence
got
*NL*
my
passage
in
a
coach
that
was
not
quite
full
to
St.
Edmund
's
Bury
,
*NL*
where
,
as
I
told
you
,
I
could
make
but
little
of
my
trade
,
only
at
a
*NL*
little
country
opera-house
made
a
shift
to
carry
off
a
gold
watch
from
*NL*
a
lady
's
side
,
who
was
not
only
intolerably
merry
,
but
,
as
I
thought
,
a
*NL*
little
fuddled
,
which
made
my
work
much
easier
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
made
off
with
this
little
booty
to
Ipswich
,
and
from
thence
to
*NL*
Harwich
,
where
I
went
into
an
inn
,
as
if
I
had
newly
arrived
from
*NL*
Holland
,
not
doubting
but
I
should
make
some
purchase
among
the
*NL*
foreigners
that
came
on
shore
there
;
but
I
found
them
generally
empty
*NL*
of
things
of
value
,
except
what
was
in
their
portmanteaux
and
Dutch
*NL*
hampers
,
which
were
generally
guarded
by
footmen
;
however
,
I
fairly
got
*NL*
one
of
their
portmanteaux
one
evening
out
of
the
chamber
where
the
*NL*
gentleman
lay
,
the
footman
being
fast
asleep
on
the
bed
,
and
I
suppose
*NL*
very
drunk
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
room
in
which
I
lodged
lay
next
to
the
Dutchman
's
,
and
having
*NL*
dragged
the
heavy
thing
with
much
ado
out
of
the
chamber
into
mine
,
I
*NL*
went
out
into
the
street
,
to
see
if
I
could
find
any
possibility
of
*NL*
carrying
it
off
.
I
walked
about
a
great
while
,
but
could
see
no
*NL*
probability
either
of
getting
out
the
thing
,
or
of
conveying
away
the
*NL*
goods
that
were
in
it
if
I
had
opened
it
,
the
town
being
so
small
,
and
*NL*
I
a
perfect
stranger
in
it
;
so
I
was
returning
with
a
resolution
to
*NL*
carry
it
back
again
,
and
leave
it
where
I
found
it
.
Just
in
that
very
*NL*
moment
I
heard
a
man
make
a
noise
to
some
people
to
make
haste
,
for
the
*NL*
boat
was
going
to
put
off
,
and
the
tide
would
be
spent
.
I
called
to
*NL*
the
fellow
,
`
What
boat
is
it
,
friend
,
'
says
I
,
`
that
you
belong
to
?
'
*NL*
`
The
Ipswich
wherry
,
madam
,
'
says
he
.
`
When
do
you
go
off
?
'
says
I.
*NL*
`
This
moment
,
madam
,
'
says
he
;
`
do
you
want
to
go
thither
?
'
`
Yes
,
'
*NL*
said
I
,
`
if
you
can
stay
till
I
fetch
my
things
.
'
`
Where
are
your
*NL*
things
,
madam
?
'
says
he
.
`
At
such
an
inn
,
'
said
I.
`
Well
,
I
'll
go
*NL*
with
you
,
madam
,
'
says
he
,
very
civilly
,
`
and
bring
them
for
you
.
'
*NL*
`
Come
away
,
then
,
'
says
I
,
and
takes
him
with
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
people
of
the
inn
were
in
a
great
hurry
,
the
packet-boat
from
*NL*
Holland
being
just
come
in
,
and
two
coaches
just
come
also
with
*NL*
passengers
from
London
,
for
another
packet-boat
that
was
going
off
for
*NL*
Holland
,
which
coaches
were
to
go
back
next
day
with
the
passengers
*NL*
that
were
just
landed
.
In
this
hurry
it
was
not
much
minded
that
I
*NL*
came
to
the
bar
and
paid
my
reckoning
,
telling
my
landlady
I
had
gotten
*NL*
my
passage
by
sea
in
a
wherry
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
wherries
are
large
vessels
,
with
good
accommodation
for
carrying
*NL*
passengers
from
Harwich
to
London
;
and
though
they
are
called
wherries
,
*NL*
which
is
a
word
used
in
the
Thames
for
a
small
boat
rowed
with
one
or
*NL*
two
men
,
yet
these
are
vessels
able
to
carry
twenty
passengers
,
and
ten
*NL*
or
fifteen
tons
of
goods
,
and
fitted
to
bear
the
sea
.
All
this
I
had
*NL*
found
out
by
inquiring
the
night
before
into
the
several
ways
of
going
*NL*
to
London
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
landlady
was
very
courteous
,
took
my
money
for
my
reckoning
,
but
was
*NL*
called
away
,
all
the
house
being
in
a
hurry
.
So
I
left
her
,
took
the
*NL*
fellow
up
to
my
chamber
,
gave
him
the
trunk
,
or
portmanteau
,
for
it
was
*NL*
like
a
trunk
,
and
wrapped
it
about
with
an
old
apron
,
and
he
went
*NL*
directly
to
his
boat
with
it
,
and
I
after
him
,
nobody
asking
us
the
*NL*
least
question
about
it
;
as
for
the
drunken
Dutch
footman
he
was
still
*NL*
asleep
,
and
his
master
with
other
foreign
gentlemen
at
supper
,
and
very
*NL*
merry
below
,
so
I
went
clean
off
with
it
to
Ipswich
;
and
going
in
the
*NL*
night
,
the
people
of
the
house
knew
nothing
but
that
I
was
gone
to
*NL*
London
by
the
Harwich
wherry
,
as
I
had
told
my
landlady
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
plagued
at
Ipswich
with
the
custom-house
officers
,
who
stopped
my
*NL*
trunk
,
as
I
called
it
,
and
would
open
and
search
it
.
I
was
willing
,
I
*NL*
told
them
,
they
should
search
it
,
but
husband
had
the
key
,
and
he
was
*NL*
not
yet
come
from
Harwich
;
this
I
said
,
that
if
upon
searching
it
they
*NL*
should
find
all
the
things
be
such
as
properly
belonged
to
a
man
rather
*NL*
than
a
woman
,
it
should
not
seem
strange
to
them
.
However
,
they
being
*NL*
positive
to
open
the
trunk
I
consented
to
have
it
be
broken
open
,
that
*NL*
is
to
say
,
to
have
the
lock
taken
off
,
which
was
not
difficult
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
found
nothing
for
their
turn
,
for
the
trunk
had
been
searched
*NL*
before
,
but
they
discovered
several
things
very
much
to
my
*NL*
satisfaction
,
as
particularly
a
parcel
of
money
in
French
pistols
,
and
*NL*
some
Dutch
ducatoons
or
rix-dollars
,
and
the
rest
was
chiefly
two
*NL*
periwigs
,
wearing-linen
,
and
razors
,
wash-balls
,
perfumes
,
and
other
*NL*
useful
things
necessary
for
a
gentleman
,
which
all
passed
for
my
*NL*
husband
's
,
and
so
I
was
quit
to
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
now
very
early
in
the
morning
,
and
not
light
,
and
I
knew
not
*NL*
well
what
course
to
take
;
for
I
made
no
doubt
but
I
should
be
pursued
*NL*
in
the
morning
,
and
perhaps
be
taken
with
the
things
about
me
;
so
I
*NL*
resolved
upon
taking
new
measures
.
I
went
publicly
to
an
inn
in
the
*NL*
town
with
my
trunk
,
as
I
called
it
,
and
having
taken
the
substance
out
,
*NL*
I
did
not
think
the
lumber
of
it
worth
my
concern
;
however
,
I
gave
it
*NL*
the
landlady
of
the
house
with
a
charge
to
take
great
care
of
it
,
and
*NL*
lay
it
up
safe
till
I
should
come
again
,
and
away
I
walked
in
to
the
*NL*
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
was
got
into
the
town
a
great
way
from
the
inn
,
I
met
with
an
*NL*
ancient
woman
who
had
just
opened
her
door
,
and
I
fell
into
chat
with
*NL*
her
,
and
asked
her
a
great
many
wild
questions
of
things
all
remote
to
*NL*
my
purpose
and
design
;
but
in
my
discourse
I
found
by
her
how
the
town
*NL*
was
situated
,
that
I
was
in
a
street
that
went
out
towards
Hadley
,
but
*NL*
that
such
a
street
went
towards
the
water-side
,
such
a
street
towards
*NL*
Colchester
,
and
so
the
London
road
lay
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
soon
my
ends
of
this
old
woman
,
for
I
only
wanted
to
know
which
*NL*
was
the
London
road
,
and
away
I
walked
as
fast
as
I
could
;
not
that
I
*NL*
intended
to
go
on
foot
,
either
to
London
or
to
Colchester
,
but
I
wanted
*NL*
to
get
quietly
away
from
Ipswich
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
walked
about
two
or
three
miles
,
and
then
I
met
a
plain
countryman
,
*NL*
who
was
busy
about
some
husbandry
work
,
I
did
not
know
what
,
and
I
*NL*
asked
him
a
great
many
questions
first
,
not
much
to
the
purpose
,
but
at
*NL*
last
told
him
I
was
going
for
London
,
and
the
coach
was
full
,
and
I
*NL*
could
not
get
a
passage
,
and
asked
him
if
he
could
tell
me
where
to
*NL*
hire
a
horse
that
would
carry
double
,
and
an
honest
man
to
ride
before
*NL*
me
to
Colchester
,
that
so
I
might
get
a
place
there
in
the
coaches
.
*NL*
The
honest
clown
looked
earnestly
at
me
,
and
said
nothing
for
above
*NL*
half
a
minute
,
when
,
scratching
his
poll
,
'
A
horse
,
say
you
and
to
*NL*
Colchester
,
to
carry
double
?
why
yes
,
mistress
,
alack-a-day
,
you
may
*NL*
have
horses
enough
for
money
.
'
`
Well
,
friend
,
'
says
I
,
`
that
I
take
*NL*
for
granted
;
I
do
n't
expect
it
without
money
.
'
`
Why
,
but
,
mistress
,
'
*NL*
says
he
,
`
how
much
are
you
willing
to
give
?
'
`
Nay
,
'
says
I
again
,
*NL*
`
friend
,
I
do
n't
know
what
your
rates
are
in
the
country
here
,
for
I
am
*NL*
a
stranger
;
but
if
you
can
get
one
for
me
,
get
it
as
cheap
as
you
can
,
*NL*
and
I
'll
give
you
somewhat
for
your
pains
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
that
's
honestly
said
too
,
'
says
the
countryman
.
`
Not
so
honest
,
*NL*
neither
,
'
said
I
to
myself
,
`
if
thou
knewest
all
.
'
`
Why
,
mistress
,
'
*NL*
says
he
,
'
I
have
a
horse
that
will
carry
double
,
and
I
do
n't
much
care
*NL*
if
I
go
myself
with
you
,
'
and
the
like
.
`
Will
you
?
'
says
I
;
`
well
,
I
*NL*
believe
you
are
an
honest
man
;
if
you
will
,
I
shall
be
glad
of
it
;
I
'll
*NL*
pay
you
in
reason
.
'
`
Why
,
look
ye
,
mistress
,
'
says
he
,
'
I
wo
n't
be
out
*NL*
of
reason
with
you
,
then
;
if
I
carry
you
to
Colchester
,
it
will
be
*NL*
worth
five
shillings
for
myself
and
my
horse
,
for
I
shall
hardly
come
*NL*
back
to-night
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
In
short
,
I
hired
the
honest
man
and
his
horse
;
but
when
we
came
to
a
*NL*
town
upon
the
road
-LRB-
I
do
not
remember
the
name
of
it
,
but
it
stands
*NL*
upon
a
river
-RRB-
,
I
pretended
myself
very
ill
,
and
I
could
go
no
farther
*NL*
that
night
but
if
he
would
stay
there
with
me
,
because
I
was
a
*NL*
stranger
,
I
would
pay
him
for
himself
and
his
horse
with
all
my
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
I
did
because
I
knew
the
Dutch
gentlemen
and
their
servants
would
*NL*
be
upon
the
road
that
day
,
either
in
the
stagecoaches
or
riding
post
,
*NL*
and
I
did
not
know
but
the
drunken
fellow
,
or
somebody
else
that
might
*NL*
have
seen
me
at
Harwich
,
might
see
me
again
,
and
so
I
thought
that
in
*NL*
one
day
's
stop
they
would
be
all
gone
by
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
lay
all
that
night
there
,
and
the
next
morning
it
was
not
very
early
*NL*
when
I
set
out
,
so
that
it
was
near
ten
o'clock
by
the
time
I
got
to
*NL*
Colchester
.
It
was
no
little
pleasure
that
I
saw
the
town
where
I
had
*NL*
so
many
pleasant
days
,
and
I
made
many
inquiries
after
the
good
old
*NL*
friends
I
had
once
had
there
,
but
could
make
little
out
;
they
were
all
*NL*
dead
or
removed
.
The
young
ladies
had
been
all
married
or
gone
to
*NL*
London
;
the
old
gentleman
and
the
old
lady
that
had
been
my
early
*NL*
benefactress
all
dead
;
and
which
troubled
me
most
,
the
young
gentleman
*NL*
my
first
lover
,
and
afterwards
my
brother-in-law
,
was
dead
;
but
two
*NL*
sons
,
men
grown
,
were
left
of
him
,
but
they
too
were
transplanted
to
*NL*
London
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
dismissed
my
old
man
here
,
and
stayed
incognito
for
three
or
four
*NL*
days
in
Colchester
,
and
then
took
a
passage
in
a
waggon
,
because
I
*NL*
would
not
venture
being
seen
in
the
Harwich
coaches
.
But
I
needed
not
*NL*
have
used
so
much
caution
,
for
there
was
nobody
in
Harwich
but
the
*NL*
woman
of
the
house
could
have
known
me
;
nor
was
it
rational
to
think
*NL*
that
she
,
considering
the
hurry
she
was
in
,
and
that
she
never
saw
me
*NL*
but
once
,
and
that
by
candlelight
,
should
have
ever
discovered
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
now
returned
to
London
,
and
though
by
the
accident
of
the
last
*NL*
adventure
I
got
something
considerable
,
yet
I
was
not
fond
of
any
more
*NL*
country
rambles
,
nor
should
I
have
ventured
abroad
again
if
I
had
*NL*
carried
the
trade
on
to
the
end
of
my
days
.
I
gave
my
governess
a
*NL*
history
of
my
travels
;
she
liked
the
Harwich
journey
well
enough
,
and
*NL*
in
discoursing
of
these
things
between
ourselves
she
observed
,
that
a
*NL*
thief
being
a
creature
that
watches
the
advantages
of
other
people
's
*NL*
mistakes
,
't
is
impossible
but
that
to
one
that
is
vigilant
and
*NL*
industrious
many
opportunities
must
happen
,
and
therefore
she
thought
*NL*
that
one
so
exquisitely
keen
in
the
trade
as
I
was
,
would
scarce
fail
*NL*
of
something
extraordinary
wherever
I
went
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
other
hand
,
every
branch
of
my
story
,
if
duly
considered
,
may
be
*NL*
useful
to
honest
people
,
and
afford
a
due
caution
to
people
of
some
*NL*
sort
or
other
to
guard
against
the
like
surprises
,
and
to
have
their
*NL*
eyes
about
them
when
they
have
to
do
with
strangers
of
any
kind
,
for
*NL*
't
is
very
seldom
that
some
snare
or
other
is
not
in
their
way
.
The
*NL*
moral
,
indeed
,
of
all
my
history
is
left
to
be
gathered
by
the
senses
*NL*
and
judgment
of
the
reader
;
I
am
not
qualified
to
preach
to
them
.
Let
*NL*
the
experience
of
one
creature
completely
wicked
,
and
completely
*NL*
miserable
,
be
a
storehouse
of
useful
warning
to
those
that
read
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
am
drawing
now
towards
a
new
variety
of
the
scenes
of
life
.
Upon
my
*NL*
return
,
being
hardened
by
a
long
race
of
crime
,
and
success
*NL*
unparalleled
,
at
least
in
the
reach
of
my
own
knowledge
,
I
had
,
as
I
*NL*
have
said
,
no
thoughts
of
laying
down
a
trade
which
,
if
I
was
to
judge
*NL*
by
the
example
of
other
,
must
,
however
,
end
at
last
in
misery
and
*NL*
sorrow
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
on
the
Christmas
day
following
,
in
the
evening
,
that
,
to
finish
*NL*
a
long
train
of
wickedness
,
I
went
abroad
to
see
what
might
offer
in
my
*NL*
way
;
when
going
by
a
working
silversmith
's
in
Foster
Lane
,
I
saw
a
*NL*
tempting
bait
indeed
,
and
not
be
resisted
by
one
of
my
occupation
,
for
*NL*
the
shop
had
nobody
in
it
,
as
I
could
see
,
and
a
great
deal
of
loose
*NL*
plate
lay
in
the
window
,
and
at
the
seat
of
the
man
,
who
usually
,
as
I
*NL*
suppose
,
worked
at
one
side
of
the
shop
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
went
boldly
in
,
and
was
just
going
to
lay
my
hand
upon
a
piece
of
*NL*
plate
,
and
might
have
done
it
,
and
carried
it
clear
off
,
for
any
care
*NL*
that
the
men
who
belonged
to
the
shop
had
taken
of
it
;
but
an
officious
*NL*
fellow
in
a
house
,
not
a
shop
,
on
the
other
side
of
the
way
,
seeing
me
*NL*
go
in
,
and
observing
that
there
was
nobody
in
the
shop
,
comes
running
*NL*
over
the
street
,
and
into
the
shop
,
and
without
asking
me
what
I
was
,
*NL*
or
who
,
seizes
upon
me
,
an
cries
out
for
the
people
of
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
not
,
as
I
said
above
,
touched
anything
in
the
shop
,
and
seeing
a
*NL*
glimpse
of
somebody
running
over
to
the
shop
,
I
had
so
much
presence
of
*NL*
mind
as
to
knock
very
hard
with
my
foot
on
the
floor
of
the
house
,
and
*NL*
was
just
calling
out
too
,
when
the
fellow
laid
hands
on
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
as
I
had
always
most
courage
when
I
was
in
most
danger
,
so
*NL*
when
the
fellow
laid
hands
on
me
,
I
stood
very
high
upon
it
,
that
I
*NL*
came
in
to
buy
half
a
dozen
of
silver
spoons
;
and
to
my
good
fortune
,
*NL*
it
was
a
silversmith
's
that
sold
plate
,
as
well
as
worked
plate
for
*NL*
other
shops
.
The
fellow
laughed
at
that
part
,
and
put
such
a
value
*NL*
upon
the
service
that
he
had
done
his
neighbour
,
that
he
would
have
it
*NL*
be
that
I
came
not
to
buy
,
but
to
steal
;
and
raising
a
great
crowd
.
I
*NL*
said
to
the
master
of
the
shop
,
who
by
this
time
was
fetched
home
from
*NL*
some
neighbouring
place
,
that
it
was
in
vain
to
make
noise
,
and
enter
*NL*
into
talk
there
of
the
case
;
the
fellow
had
insisted
that
I
came
to
*NL*
steal
,
and
he
must
prove
it
,
and
I
desired
we
might
go
before
a
*NL*
magistrate
without
any
more
words
;
for
I
began
to
see
I
should
be
too
*NL*
hard
for
the
man
that
had
seized
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
master
and
mistress
of
the
shop
were
really
not
so
violent
as
the
*NL*
man
from
t
`
other
side
of
the
way
;
and
the
man
said
,
`
Mistress
,
you
*NL*
might
come
into
the
shop
with
a
good
design
for
aught
I
know
,
but
it
*NL*
seemed
a
dangerous
thing
for
you
to
come
into
such
a
shop
as
mine
is
,
*NL*
when
you
see
nobody
there
;
and
I
can
not
do
justice
to
my
neighbour
,
who
*NL*
was
so
kind
to
me
,
as
not
to
acknowledge
he
had
reason
on
his
side
;
*NL*
though
,
upon
the
whole
,
I
do
not
find
you
attempted
to
take
anything
,
*NL*
and
I
really
know
not
what
to
do
in
it
.
'
I
pressed
him
to
go
before
a
*NL*
magistrate
with
me
,
and
if
anything
could
be
proved
on
me
that
was
like
*NL*
a
design
of
robbery
,
I
should
willingly
submit
,
but
if
not
,
I
expected
*NL*
reparation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Just
while
we
were
in
this
debate
,
and
a
crowd
of
people
gathered
about
*NL*
the
door
,
came
by
Sir
T.
B.
,
an
alderman
of
the
city
,
and
justice
of
*NL*
the
peace
,
and
the
goldsmith
hearing
of
it
,
goes
out
,
and
entreated
his
*NL*
worship
to
come
in
and
decide
the
case
.
*NL*
*NL*
Give
the
goldsmith
his
due
,
he
told
his
story
with
a
great
deal
of
*NL*
justice
and
moderation
,
and
the
fellow
that
had
come
over
,
and
seized
*NL*
upon
me
,
told
his
with
as
much
heat
and
foolish
passion
,
which
did
me
*NL*
good
still
,
rather
than
harm
.
It
came
then
to
my
turn
to
speak
,
and
I
*NL*
told
his
worship
that
I
was
a
stranger
in
London
,
being
newly
come
out
*NL*
of
the
north
;
that
I
lodged
in
such
a
place
,
that
I
was
passing
this
*NL*
street
,
and
went
into
the
goldsmith
's
shop
to
buy
half
a
dozen
of
*NL*
spoons
.
By
great
luck
I
had
an
old
silver
spoon
in
my
pocket
,
which
I
*NL*
pulled
out
,
and
told
him
I
had
carried
that
spoon
to
match
it
with
half
*NL*
a
dozen
of
new
ones
,
that
it
might
match
some
I
had
in
the
country
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
seeing
nobody
I
the
shop
,
I
knocked
with
my
foot
very
hard
to
make
*NL*
the
people
hear
,
and
had
also
called
aloud
with
my
voice
;
't
is
true
,
*NL*
there
was
loose
plate
in
the
shop
,
but
that
nobody
could
say
I
had
*NL*
touched
any
of
it
,
or
gone
near
it
;
that
a
fellow
came
running
into
the
*NL*
shop
out
of
the
street
,
and
laid
hands
on
me
in
a
furious
manner
,
in
*NL*
the
very
moments
while
I
was
calling
for
the
people
of
the
house
;
that
*NL*
if
he
had
really
had
a
mind
to
have
done
his
neighbour
any
service
,
he
*NL*
should
have
stood
at
a
distance
,
and
silently
watched
to
see
whether
I
*NL*
had
touched
anything
or
no
,
and
then
have
clapped
in
upon
me
,
and
taken
*NL*
me
in
the
fact
.
`
That
is
very
true
,
'
says
Mr.
Alderman
,
and
turning
to
*NL*
the
fellow
that
stopped
me
,
he
asked
him
if
it
was
true
that
I
knocked
*NL*
with
my
foot
?
He
said
,
yes
,
I
had
knocked
,
but
that
might
be
because
*NL*
of
his
coming
.
`
Nay
,
'
says
the
alderman
,
taking
him
short
,
`
now
you
*NL*
contradict
yourself
,
for
just
now
you
said
she
was
in
the
shop
with
her
*NL*
back
to
you
,
and
did
not
see
you
till
you
came
upon
her
.
'
Now
it
was
*NL*
true
that
my
back
was
partly
to
the
street
,
but
yet
as
my
business
was
*NL*
of
a
kind
that
required
me
to
have
my
eyes
every
way
,
so
I
really
had
a
*NL*
glance
of
him
running
over
,
as
I
said
before
,
though
he
did
not
*NL*
perceive
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
full
hearing
,
the
alderman
gave
it
as
his
opinion
that
his
*NL*
neighbour
was
under
a
mistake
,
and
that
I
was
innocent
,
and
the
*NL*
goldsmith
acquiesced
in
it
too
,
and
his
wife
,
and
so
I
was
dismissed
;
*NL*
but
as
I
was
going
to
depart
,
Mr.
Alderman
said
,
`
But
hold
,
madam
,
if
*NL*
you
were
designing
to
buy
spoons
,
I
hope
you
will
not
let
my
friend
*NL*
here
lose
his
customer
by
the
mistake
.
'
I
readily
answered
,
`
No
,
sir
,
*NL*
I
'll
buy
the
spoons
still
,
if
he
can
match
my
odd
spoon
,
which
I
*NL*
brought
for
a
pattern
'
;
and
the
goldsmith
showed
me
some
of
the
very
*NL*
same
fashion
.
So
he
weighed
the
spoons
,
and
they
came
to
*NL*
five-and-thirty
shillings
,
so
I
pulls
out
my
purse
to
pay
him
,
in
which
*NL*
I
had
near
twenty
guineas
,
for
I
never
went
without
such
a
sum
about
*NL*
me
,
whatever
might
happen
,
and
I
found
it
of
use
at
other
times
as
well
*NL*
as
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Mr.
Alderman
saw
my
money
,
he
said
,
`
Well
,
madam
,
now
I
am
*NL*
satisfied
you
were
wronged
,
and
it
was
for
this
reason
that
I
moved
you
*NL*
should
buy
the
spoons
,
and
stayed
till
you
had
bought
them
,
for
if
you
*NL*
had
not
had
money
to
pay
for
them
,
I
should
have
suspected
that
you
did
*NL*
not
come
into
the
shop
with
an
intent
to
buy
,
for
indeed
the
sort
of
*NL*
people
who
come
upon
these
designs
that
you
have
been
charged
with
,
are
*NL*
seldom
troubled
with
much
gold
in
their
pockets
,
as
I
see
you
are
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
smiled
,
and
told
his
worship
,
that
then
I
owed
something
of
his
*NL*
favour
to
my
money
,
but
I
hoped
he
saw
reason
also
in
the
justice
he
*NL*
had
done
me
before
.
He
said
,
yes
,
he
had
,
but
this
had
confirmed
his
*NL*
opinion
,
and
he
was
fully
satisfied
now
of
my
having
been
injured
.
So
*NL*
I
came
off
with
flying
colours
,
though
from
an
affair
in
which
I
was
at
*NL*
the
very
brink
of
destruction
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
but
three
days
after
this
,
that
not
at
all
made
cautious
by
my
*NL*
former
danger
,
as
I
used
to
be
,
and
still
pursuing
the
art
which
I
had
*NL*
so
long
been
employed
in
,
I
ventured
into
a
house
where
I
saw
the
doors
*NL*
open
,
and
furnished
myself
,
as
I
though
verily
without
being
perceived
,
*NL*
with
two
pieces
of
flowered
silks
,
such
as
they
call
brocaded
silk
,
*NL*
very
rich
.
It
was
not
a
mercer
's
shop
,
nor
a
warehouse
of
a
mercer
,
*NL*
but
looked
like
a
private
dwelling-house
,
and
was
,
it
seems
,
inhabited
*NL*
by
a
man
that
sold
goods
for
the
weavers
to
the
mercers
,
like
a
broker
*NL*
or
factor
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
I
may
make
short
of
this
black
part
of
this
story
,
I
was
attacked
*NL*
by
two
wenches
that
came
open-mouthed
at
me
just
as
I
was
going
out
at
*NL*
the
door
,
and
one
of
them
pulled
me
back
into
the
room
,
while
the
other
*NL*
shut
the
door
upon
me
.
I
would
have
given
them
good
words
,
but
there
*NL*
was
no
room
for
it
,
two
fiery
dragons
could
not
have
been
more
furious
*NL*
than
they
were
;
they
tore
my
clothes
,
bullied
and
roared
as
if
they
*NL*
would
have
murdered
me
;
the
mistress
of
the
house
came
next
,
and
then
*NL*
the
master
,
and
all
outrageous
,
for
a
while
especially
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
gave
the
master
very
good
words
,
told
him
the
door
was
open
,
and
*NL*
things
were
a
temptation
to
me
,
that
I
was
poor
and
distressed
,
and
*NL*
poverty
was
when
many
could
not
resist
,
and
begged
him
with
tears
to
*NL*
have
pity
on
me
.
The
mistress
of
the
house
was
moved
with
compassion
,
*NL*
and
inclined
to
have
let
me
go
,
and
had
almost
persuaded
her
husband
to
*NL*
it
also
,
but
the
saucy
wenches
were
run
,
even
before
they
were
sent
,
*NL*
and
had
fetched
a
constable
,
and
then
the
master
said
he
could
not
go
*NL*
back
,
I
must
go
before
a
justice
,
and
answered
his
wife
that
he
might
*NL*
come
into
trouble
himself
if
he
should
let
me
go
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sight
of
the
constable
,
indeed
,
struck
me
with
terror
,
and
I
*NL*
thought
I
should
have
sunk
into
the
ground
.
I
fell
into
faintings
,
and
*NL*
indeed
the
people
themselves
thought
I
would
have
died
,
when
the
woman
*NL*
argued
again
for
me
,
and
entreated
her
husband
,
seeing
they
had
lost
*NL*
nothing
,
to
let
me
go
.
I
offered
him
to
pay
for
the
two
pieces
,
*NL*
whatever
the
value
was
,
though
I
had
not
got
them
,
and
argued
that
as
*NL*
he
had
his
goods
,
and
had
really
lost
nothing
,
it
would
be
cruel
to
*NL*
pursue
me
to
death
,
and
have
my
blood
for
the
bare
attempt
of
taking
*NL*
them
.
I
put
the
constable
in
mind
that
I
had
broke
no
doors
,
nor
*NL*
carried
anything
away
;
and
when
I
came
to
the
justice
,
and
pleaded
*NL*
there
that
I
had
neither
broken
anything
to
get
in
,
nor
carried
*NL*
anything
out
,
the
justice
was
inclined
to
have
released
me
;
but
the
*NL*
first
saucy
jade
that
stopped
me
,
affirming
that
I
was
going
out
with
*NL*
the
goods
,
but
that
she
stopped
me
and
pulled
me
back
as
I
was
upon
the
*NL*
threshold
,
the
justice
upon
that
point
committed
me
,
and
I
was
carried
*NL*
to
Newgate
.
That
horrid
place
!
my
very
blood
chills
at
the
mention
of
*NL*
its
name
;
the
place
where
so
many
of
my
comrades
had
been
locked
up
,
*NL*
and
from
whence
they
went
to
the
fatal
tree
;
the
place
where
my
mother
*NL*
suffered
so
deeply
,
where
I
was
brought
into
the
world
,
and
from
whence
*NL*
I
expected
no
redemption
but
by
an
infamous
death
:
to
conclude
,
the
*NL*
place
that
had
so
long
expected
me
,
and
which
with
so
much
art
and
*NL*
success
I
had
so
long
avoided
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
not
fixed
indeed
;
't
is
impossible
to
describe
the
terror
of
my
*NL*
mind
,
when
I
was
first
brought
in
,
and
when
I
looked
around
upon
all
*NL*
the
horrors
of
that
dismal
place
.
I
looked
on
myself
as
lost
,
and
that
*NL*
I
had
nothing
to
think
of
but
of
going
out
of
the
world
,
and
that
with
*NL*
the
utmost
infamy
:
the
hellish
noise
,
the
roaring
,
swearing
,
and
*NL*
clamour
,
the
stench
and
nastiness
,
and
all
the
dreadful
crowd
of
*NL*
afflicting
things
that
I
saw
there
,
joined
together
to
make
the
place
*NL*
seem
an
emblem
of
hell
itself
,
and
a
kind
of
an
entrance
into
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
I
reproached
myself
with
the
many
hints
I
had
had
,
as
I
have
*NL*
mentioned
above
,
from
my
own
reason
,
from
the
sense
of
my
good
*NL*
circumstances
,
and
of
the
many
dangers
I
had
escaped
,
to
leave
off
*NL*
while
I
was
well
,
and
how
I
had
withstood
them
all
,
and
hardened
my
*NL*
thoughts
against
all
fear
.
It
seemed
to
me
that
I
was
hurried
on
by
an
*NL*
inevitable
and
unseen
fate
to
this
day
of
misery
,
and
that
now
I
was
to
*NL*
expiate
all
my
offences
at
the
gallows
;
that
I
was
now
to
give
*NL*
satisfaction
to
justice
with
my
blood
,
and
that
I
was
come
to
the
last
*NL*
hour
of
my
life
and
of
my
wickedness
together
.
These
things
poured
*NL*
themselves
in
upon
my
thoughts
in
a
confused
manner
,
and
left
me
*NL*
overwhelmed
with
melancholy
and
despair
.
*NL*
*NL*
Them
I
repented
heartily
of
all
my
life
past
,
but
that
repentance
*NL*
yielded
me
no
satisfaction
,
no
peace
,
no
,
not
in
the
least
,
because
,
as
*NL*
I
said
to
myself
,
it
was
repenting
after
the
power
of
further
sinning
*NL*
was
taken
away
.
I
seemed
not
to
mourn
that
I
had
committed
such
*NL*
crimes
,
and
for
the
fact
as
it
was
an
offence
against
God
and
my
*NL*
neighbour
,
but
I
mourned
that
I
was
to
be
punished
for
it
.
I
was
a
*NL*
penitent
,
as
I
thought
,
not
that
I
had
sinned
,
but
that
I
was
to
*NL*
suffer
,
and
this
took
away
all
the
comfort
,
and
even
the
hope
of
my
*NL*
repentance
in
my
own
thoughts
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
got
no
sleep
for
several
nights
or
days
after
I
came
into
that
*NL*
wretched
place
,
and
glad
I
would
have
been
for
some
time
to
have
died
*NL*
there
,
though
I
did
not
consider
dying
as
it
ought
to
be
considered
*NL*
neither
;
indeed
,
nothing
could
be
filled
with
more
horror
to
my
*NL*
imagination
than
the
very
place
,
nothing
was
more
odious
to
me
than
the
*NL*
company
that
was
there
.
Oh
!
if
I
had
but
been
sent
to
any
place
in
*NL*
the
world
,
and
not
to
Newgate
,
I
should
have
thought
myself
happy
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
next
place
,
how
did
the
hardened
wretches
that
were
there
before
*NL*
me
triumph
over
me
!
What
!
Mrs.
Flanders
come
to
Newgate
at
last
?
*NL*
What
!
Mrs.
Mary
,
Mrs.
Molly
,
and
after
that
plain
Moll
Flanders
?
They
*NL*
thought
the
devil
had
helped
me
,
they
said
,
that
I
had
reigned
so
long
;
*NL*
they
expected
me
there
many
years
ago
,
and
was
I
come
at
last
?
Then
*NL*
they
flouted
me
with
my
dejections
,
welcomed
me
to
the
place
,
wished
me
*NL*
joy
,
bid
me
have
a
good
heart
,
not
to
be
cast
down
,
things
might
not
be
*NL*
so
bad
as
I
feared
,
and
the
like
;
then
called
for
brandy
,
and
drank
to
*NL*
me
,
but
put
it
all
up
to
my
score
,
for
they
told
me
I
was
but
just
come
*NL*
to
the
college
,
as
they
called
it
,
and
sure
I
had
money
in
my
pocket
,
*NL*
though
they
had
none
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
asked
one
of
this
crew
how
long
she
had
been
there
.
She
said
four
*NL*
months
.
I
asked
her
how
the
place
looked
to
her
when
she
first
came
*NL*
into
it
.
`
Just
as
it
did
now
to
you
,
'
says
she
,
dreadful
and
*NL*
frightful
'
;
that
she
thought
she
was
in
hell
;
`
and
I
believe
so
still
,
'
*NL*
adds
she
,
`
but
it
is
natural
to
me
now
,
I
do
n't
disturb
myself
about
*NL*
it
.
'
'
I
suppose
,
'
says
I
,
`
you
are
in
no
danger
of
what
is
to
follow
?
'
*NL*
`
Nay
,
'
says
she
,
`
for
you
are
mistaken
there
,
I
assure
you
,
for
I
am
*NL*
under
sentence
,
only
I
pleaded
my
belly
,
but
I
am
no
more
with
child
*NL*
than
the
judge
that
tried
me
,
and
I
expect
to
be
called
down
next
*NL*
sessions
.
'
This
`
calling
down
'
is
calling
down
to
their
former
*NL*
judgment
,
when
a
woman
has
been
respited
for
her
belly
,
but
proves
not
*NL*
to
be
with
child
,
or
if
she
has
been
with
child
,
and
has
been
brought
*NL*
to
bed
.
`
Well
,
'
says
I
,
`
are
you
thus
easy
?
'
`
Ay
,
'
says
she
,
'
I
ca
n't
*NL*
help
myself
;
what
signifies
being
sad
?
If
I
am
hanged
,
there
's
an
end
*NL*
of
me
,
'
says
she
;
and
away
she
turns
dancing
,
and
sings
as
she
goes
the
*NL*
following
piece
of
Newgate
wit
--
*NL*
*NL*
`
If
I
swing
by
the
string
*NL*
I
shall
hear
the
bell
ring
*NL*
And
then
there
's
an
end
of
poor
Jenny
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
mention
this
because
it
would
be
worth
the
observation
of
any
*NL*
prisoner
,
who
shall
hereafter
fall
into
the
same
misfortune
,
and
come
*NL*
to
that
dreadful
place
of
Newgate
,
how
time
,
necessity
,
and
conversing
*NL*
with
the
wretches
that
are
there
familiarizes
the
place
to
them
;
how
at
*NL*
last
they
become
reconciled
to
that
which
at
first
was
the
greatest
*NL*
dread
upon
their
spirits
in
the
world
,
and
are
as
impudently
cheerful
*NL*
and
merry
in
their
misery
as
they
were
when
out
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
can
not
say
,
as
some
do
,
this
devil
is
not
so
black
as
he
is
painted
;
*NL*
for
indeed
no
colours
can
represent
the
place
to
the
life
,
not
any
soul
*NL*
conceive
aright
of
it
but
those
who
have
been
sufferers
there
.
But
how
*NL*
hell
should
become
by
degree
so
natural
,
and
not
only
tolerable
,
but
*NL*
even
agreeable
,
is
a
thing
unintelligible
but
by
those
who
have
*NL*
experienced
it
,
as
I
have
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
same
night
that
I
was
sent
to
Newgate
,
I
sent
the
news
of
it
to
my
*NL*
old
governess
,
who
was
surprised
at
it
,
you
may
be
sure
,
and
spent
the
*NL*
night
almost
as
ill
out
of
Newgate
,
as
I
did
in
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
morning
she
came
to
see
me
;
she
did
what
she
could
to
comfort
*NL*
me
,
but
she
saw
that
was
to
no
purpose
;
however
,
as
she
said
,
to
sink
*NL*
under
the
weight
was
but
to
increase
the
weight
;
she
immediately
*NL*
applied
herself
to
all
the
proper
methods
to
prevent
the
effects
of
it
,
*NL*
which
we
feared
,
and
first
she
found
out
the
two
fiery
jades
that
had
*NL*
surprised
me
.
She
tampered
with
them
,
offered
them
money
,
and
,
in
a
*NL*
word
,
tried
all
imaginable
ways
to
prevent
a
prosecution
;
she
offered
*NL*
one
of
the
wenches
#
100
to
go
away
from
her
mistress
,
and
not
to
appear
*NL*
against
me
,
but
she
was
so
resolute
,
that
though
she
was
but
a
servant
*NL*
maid
at
#
3
a
year
wages
or
thereabouts
,
she
refused
it
,
and
would
have
*NL*
refused
it
,
as
my
governess
said
she
believed
,
if
she
had
offered
her
*NL*
#
500
.
Then
she
attacked
the
other
maid
;
she
was
not
so
hard-hearted
in
*NL*
appearance
as
the
other
,
and
sometimes
seemed
inclined
to
be
merciful
;
*NL*
but
the
first
wench
kept
her
up
,
and
changed
her
mind
,
and
would
not
so
*NL*
much
as
let
my
governess
talk
with
her
,
but
threatened
to
have
her
up
*NL*
for
tampering
with
the
evidence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
applied
to
the
master
,
that
is
to
say
,
the
man
whose
goods
had
*NL*
been
stolen
,
and
particularly
to
his
wife
,
who
,
as
I
told
you
,
was
*NL*
inclined
at
first
to
have
some
compassion
for
me
;
she
found
the
woman
*NL*
the
same
still
,
but
the
man
alleged
he
was
bound
by
the
justice
that
*NL*
committed
me
,
to
prosecute
,
and
that
he
should
forfeit
his
recognisance
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
governess
offered
to
find
friends
that
should
get
his
recognisances
*NL*
off
of
the
file
,
as
they
call
it
,
and
that
he
should
not
suffer
;
but
it
*NL*
was
not
possible
to
convince
him
that
could
be
done
,
or
that
he
could
*NL*
be
safe
any
way
in
the
world
but
by
appearing
against
me
;
so
I
was
to
*NL*
have
three
witnesses
of
fact
against
me
,
the
master
and
his
two
maids
;
*NL*
that
is
to
say
,
I
was
as
certain
to
be
cast
for
my
life
as
I
was
*NL*
certain
that
I
was
alive
,
and
I
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
think
of
*NL*
dying
,
and
prepare
for
it
.
I
had
but
a
sad
foundation
to
build
upon
,
*NL*
as
I
said
before
,
for
all
my
repentance
appeared
to
me
to
be
only
the
*NL*
effect
of
my
fear
of
death
,
not
a
sincere
regret
for
the
wicked
life
*NL*
that
I
had
lived
,
and
which
had
brought
this
misery
upon
me
,
for
the
*NL*
offending
my
Creator
,
who
was
now
suddenly
to
be
my
judge
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
lived
many
days
here
under
the
utmost
horror
of
soul
;
I
had
death
,
as
*NL*
it
were
,
in
view
,
and
thought
of
nothing
night
and
day
,
but
of
gibbets
*NL*
and
halters
,
evil
spirits
and
devils
;
it
is
not
to
be
expressed
by
*NL*
words
how
I
was
harassed
,
between
the
dreadful
apprehensions
of
death
*NL*
and
the
terror
of
my
conscience
reproaching
me
with
my
past
horrible
*NL*
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
ordinary
of
Newgate
came
to
me
,
and
talked
a
little
in
his
way
,
but
*NL*
all
his
divinity
ran
upon
confessing
my
crime
,
as
he
called
it
-LRB-
though
*NL*
he
knew
not
what
I
was
in
for
-RRB-
,
making
a
full
discovery
,
and
the
like
,
*NL*
without
which
he
told
me
God
would
never
forgive
me
;
and
he
said
so
*NL*
little
to
the
purpose
,
that
I
had
no
manner
of
consolation
from
him
;
*NL*
and
then
to
observe
the
poor
creature
preaching
confession
and
*NL*
repentance
to
me
in
the
morning
,
and
find
him
drunk
with
brandy
and
*NL*
spirits
by
noon
,
this
had
something
in
it
so
shocking
,
that
I
began
to
*NL*
nauseate
the
man
more
than
his
work
,
and
his
work
too
by
degrees
,
for
*NL*
the
sake
of
the
man
;
so
that
I
desired
him
to
trouble
me
no
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
know
not
how
it
was
,
but
by
the
indefatigable
application
of
my
*NL*
diligent
governess
I
had
no
bill
preferred
against
me
the
first
*NL*
sessions
,
I
mean
to
the
grand
jury
,
at
Guildhall
;
so
I
had
another
*NL*
month
or
five
weeks
before
me
,
and
without
doubt
this
ought
to
have
*NL*
been
accepted
by
me
,
as
so
much
time
given
me
for
reflection
upon
what
*NL*
was
past
,
and
preparation
for
what
was
to
come
;
or
,
in
a
word
,
I
ought
*NL*
to
have
esteemed
it
as
a
space
given
me
for
repentance
,
and
have
*NL*
employed
it
as
such
,
but
it
was
not
in
me
.
I
was
sorry
-LRB-
as
before
-RRB-
for
*NL*
being
in
Newgate
,
but
had
very
few
signs
of
repentance
about
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
contrary
,
like
the
waters
in
the
cavities
and
hollows
of
*NL*
mountains
,
which
petrify
and
turn
into
stone
whatever
they
are
suffered
*NL*
to
drop
on
,
so
the
continual
conversing
with
such
a
crew
of
hell-hounds
*NL*
as
I
was
,
had
the
same
common
operation
upon
me
as
upon
other
people
.
*NL*
I
degenerated
into
stone
;
I
turned
first
stupid
and
senseless
,
then
*NL*
brutish
and
thoughtless
,
and
at
last
raving
mad
as
any
of
them
were
;
*NL*
and
,
in
short
,
I
became
as
naturally
pleased
and
easy
with
the
place
,
*NL*
as
if
indeed
I
had
been
born
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
scarce
possible
to
imagine
that
our
natures
should
be
capable
of
*NL*
so
much
degeneracy
,
as
to
make
that
pleasant
and
agreeable
that
in
*NL*
itself
is
the
most
complete
misery
.
Here
was
a
circumstance
that
I
*NL*
think
it
is
scarce
possible
to
mention
a
worse
:
I
was
as
exquisitely
*NL*
miserable
as
,
speaking
of
common
cases
,
it
was
possible
for
any
one
to
*NL*
be
that
had
life
and
health
,
and
money
to
help
them
,
as
I
had
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
weight
of
guilt
upon
me
enough
to
sink
any
creature
who
had
the
*NL*
least
power
of
reflection
left
,
and
had
any
sense
upon
them
of
the
*NL*
happiness
of
this
life
,
of
the
misery
of
another
;
then
I
had
at
first
*NL*
remorse
indeed
,
but
no
repentance
;
I
had
now
neither
remorse
nor
*NL*
repentance
.
I
had
a
crime
charged
on
me
,
the
punishment
of
which
was
*NL*
death
by
our
law
;
the
proof
so
evident
,
that
there
was
no
room
for
me
*NL*
so
much
as
to
plead
not
guilty
.
I
had
the
name
of
an
old
offender
,
so
*NL*
that
I
had
nothing
to
expect
but
death
in
a
few
weeks
'
time
,
neither
*NL*
had
I
myself
any
thoughts
of
escaping
;
and
yet
a
certain
strange
*NL*
lethargy
of
soul
possessed
me
.
I
had
no
trouble
,
no
apprehensions
,
no
*NL*
sorrow
about
me
,
the
first
surprise
was
gone
;
I
was
,
I
may
well
say
,
I
*NL*
know
not
how
;
my
senses
,
my
reason
,
nay
,
my
conscience
,
were
all
*NL*
asleep
;
my
course
of
life
for
forty
years
had
been
a
horrid
*NL*
complication
of
wickedness
,
whoredom
,
adultery
,
incest
,
lying
,
theft
;
*NL*
and
,
in
a
word
,
everything
but
murder
and
treason
had
been
my
practice
*NL*
from
the
age
of
eighteen
,
or
thereabouts
,
to
three-score
;
and
now
I
was
*NL*
engulfed
in
the
misery
of
punishment
,
and
had
an
infamous
death
just
at
*NL*
the
door
,
and
yet
I
had
no
sense
of
my
condition
,
no
thought
of
heaven
*NL*
or
hell
at
least
,
that
went
any
farther
than
a
bare
flying
touch
,
like
*NL*
the
stitch
or
pain
that
gives
a
hint
and
goes
off
.
I
neither
had
a
*NL*
heart
to
ask
God
's
mercy
,
nor
indeed
to
think
of
it
.
And
in
this
,
I
*NL*
think
,
I
have
given
a
brief
description
of
the
completest
misery
on
*NL*
earth
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
my
terrifying
thoughts
were
past
,
the
horrors
of
the
place
were
*NL*
become
familiar
,
and
I
felt
no
more
uneasiness
at
the
noise
and
*NL*
clamours
of
the
prison
,
than
they
did
who
made
that
noise
;
in
a
word
,
I
*NL*
was
become
a
mere
Newgate-bird
,
as
wicked
and
as
outrageous
as
any
of
*NL*
them
;
nay
,
I
scarce
retained
the
habit
and
custom
of
good
breeding
and
*NL*
manners
,
which
all
along
till
now
ran
through
my
conversation
;
so
*NL*
thorough
a
degeneracy
had
possessed
me
,
that
I
was
no
more
the
same
*NL*
thing
that
I
had
been
,
than
if
I
had
never
been
otherwise
than
what
I
*NL*
was
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
middle
of
this
hardened
part
of
my
life
I
had
another
sudden
*NL*
surprise
,
which
called
me
back
a
little
to
that
thing
called
sorrow
,
*NL*
which
indeed
I
began
to
be
past
the
sense
of
before
.
They
told
me
one
*NL*
night
that
there
was
brought
into
the
prison
late
the
night
before
*NL*
three
highwaymen
,
who
had
committed
robbery
somewhere
on
the
road
to
*NL*
Windsor
,
Hounslow
Heath
,
I
think
it
was
,
and
were
pursued
to
Uxbridge
*NL*
by
the
country
,
and
were
taken
there
after
a
gallant
resistance
,
in
*NL*
which
I
know
not
how
many
of
the
country
people
were
wounded
,
and
some
*NL*
killed
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
not
to
be
wondered
that
we
prisoners
were
all
desirous
enough
to
*NL*
see
these
brave
,
topping
gentlemen
,
that
were
talked
up
to
be
such
as
*NL*
their
fellows
had
not
been
known
,
and
especially
because
it
was
said
*NL*
they
would
in
the
morning
be
removed
into
the
press-yard
,
having
given
*NL*
money
to
the
head
master
of
the
prison
,
to
be
allowed
the
liberty
of
*NL*
that
better
part
of
the
prison
.
So
we
that
were
women
placed
ourselves
*NL*
in
the
way
,
that
we
would
be
sure
to
see
them
;
but
nothing
could
*NL*
express
the
amazement
and
surprise
I
was
in
,
when
the
very
first
man
*NL*
that
came
out
I
knew
to
be
my
Lancashire
husband
,
the
same
who
lived
so
*NL*
well
at
Dunstable
,
and
the
same
who
I
afterwards
saw
at
Brickhill
,
when
*NL*
I
was
married
to
my
last
husband
,
as
has
been
related
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
struck
dumb
at
the
sight
,
and
knew
neither
what
to
say
nor
what
*NL*
to
do
;
he
did
not
know
me
,
and
that
was
all
the
present
relief
I
had
.
*NL*
I
quitted
my
company
,
and
retired
as
much
as
that
dreadful
place
*NL*
suffers
anybody
to
retire
,
and
I
cried
vehemently
for
a
great
while
.
*NL*
`
Dreadful
creature
that
I
am
,
'
said
I
,
`
how
many
poor
people
have
I
made
*NL*
miserable
?
How
many
desperate
wretches
have
I
sent
to
the
devil
?
'
He
*NL*
had
told
me
at
Chester
he
was
ruined
by
that
match
,
and
that
his
*NL*
fortunes
were
made
desperate
on
my
account
;
for
that
thinking
I
had
*NL*
been
a
fortune
,
he
was
run
into
debt
more
than
he
was
able
to
pay
,
and
*NL*
that
he
knew
not
what
course
to
take
;
that
he
would
go
into
the
army
*NL*
and
carry
a
musket
,
or
buy
a
horse
and
take
a
tour
,
as
he
called
it
;
*NL*
and
though
I
never
told
him
that
I
was
a
fortune
,
and
so
did
not
*NL*
actually
deceive
him
myself
,
yet
I
did
encourage
the
having
it
thought
*NL*
that
I
was
so
,
and
by
that
means
I
was
the
occasion
originally
of
his
*NL*
mischief
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
surprise
of
the
thing
only
struck
deeper
into
my
thoughts
,
any
gave
*NL*
me
stronger
reflections
than
all
that
had
befallen
me
before
.
I
*NL*
grieved
day
and
night
for
him
,
and
the
more
for
that
they
told
me
he
*NL*
was
the
captain
of
the
gang
,
and
that
he
had
committed
so
many
*NL*
robberies
,
that
Hind
,
or
Whitney
,
or
the
Golden
Farmer
were
fools
to
*NL*
him
;
that
he
would
surely
be
hanged
if
there
were
no
more
men
left
in
*NL*
the
country
he
was
born
in
;
and
that
there
would
abundance
of
people
*NL*
come
in
against
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
overwhelmed
with
grief
for
him
;
my
own
case
gave
me
no
*NL*
disturbance
compared
to
this
,
and
I
loaded
myself
with
reproaches
on
*NL*
his
account
.
I
bewailed
his
misfortunes
,
and
the
ruin
he
was
now
come
*NL*
to
,
at
such
a
rate
,
that
I
relished
nothing
now
as
I
did
before
,
and
*NL*
the
first
reflections
I
made
upon
the
horrid
,
detestable
life
I
had
*NL*
lived
began
to
return
upon
me
,
and
as
these
things
returned
,
my
*NL*
abhorrence
of
the
place
I
was
in
,
and
of
the
way
of
living
in
it
,
*NL*
returned
also
;
in
a
word
,
I
was
perfectly
changed
,
and
become
another
*NL*
body
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
I
was
under
these
influences
of
sorrow
for
him
,
came
notice
to
me
*NL*
that
the
next
sessions
approaching
there
would
be
a
bill
preferred
to
*NL*
the
grand
jury
against
me
,
and
that
I
should
be
certainly
tried
for
my
*NL*
life
at
the
Old
Bailey
.
My
temper
was
touched
before
,
the
hardened
,
*NL*
wretched
boldness
of
spirit
which
I
had
acquired
abated
,
and
conscious
*NL*
in
the
prison
,
guilt
began
to
flow
in
upon
my
mind
.
In
short
,
I
began
*NL*
to
think
,
and
to
think
is
one
real
advance
from
hell
to
heaven
.
All
*NL*
that
hellish
,
hardened
state
and
temper
of
soul
,
which
I
have
said
so
*NL*
much
of
before
,
is
but
a
deprivation
of
thought
;
he
that
is
restored
to
*NL*
his
power
of
thinking
,
is
restored
to
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
I
began
,
I
say
,
to
think
,
the
first
think
that
occurred
to
*NL*
me
broke
out
thus
:
`
Lord
!
what
will
become
of
me
?
I
shall
certainly
*NL*
die
!
I
shall
be
cast
,
to
be
sure
,
and
there
is
nothing
beyond
that
but
*NL*
death
!
I
have
no
friends
;
what
shall
I
do
?
I
shall
be
certainly
cast
!
*NL*
Lord
,
have
mercy
upon
me
!
What
will
become
of
me
?
'
This
was
a
sad
*NL*
thought
,
you
will
say
,
to
be
the
first
,
after
so
long
a
time
,
that
had
*NL*
started
into
my
soul
of
that
kind
,
and
yet
even
this
was
nothing
but
*NL*
fright
at
what
was
to
come
;
there
was
not
a
word
of
sincere
repentance
*NL*
in
it
all
.
However
,
I
was
indeed
dreadfully
dejected
,
and
disconsolate
*NL*
to
the
last
degree
;
and
as
I
had
no
friend
in
the
world
to
communicate
*NL*
my
distressed
thoughts
to
,
it
lay
so
heavy
upon
me
,
that
it
threw
me
*NL*
into
fits
and
swoonings
several
times
a
day
.
I
sent
for
my
old
*NL*
governess
,
and
she
,
give
her
her
due
,
acted
the
part
of
a
true
friend
.
*NL*
She
left
no
stone
unturned
to
prevent
the
grand
jury
finding
the
bill
.
*NL*
She
sought
out
one
or
two
of
the
jurymen
,
talked
with
them
,
and
*NL*
endeavoured
to
possess
them
with
favourable
dispositions
,
on
account
*NL*
that
nothing
was
taken
away
,
and
no
house
broken
,
etc.
;
but
all
would
*NL*
not
do
,
they
were
over-ruled
by
the
rest
;
the
two
wenches
swore
home
to
*NL*
the
fact
,
and
the
jury
found
the
bill
against
me
for
robbery
and
*NL*
house-breaking
,
that
is
,
for
felony
and
burglary
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
sunk
down
when
they
brought
me
news
of
it
,
and
after
I
came
to
myself
*NL*
again
,
I
thought
I
should
have
died
with
the
weight
of
it
.
My
*NL*
governess
acted
a
true
mother
to
me
;
she
pitied
me
,
she
cried
with
me
,
*NL*
and
for
me
,
but
she
could
not
help
me
;
and
to
add
to
the
terror
of
it
,
*NL*
't
was
the
discourse
all
over
the
house
that
I
should
die
for
it
.
I
*NL*
could
hear
them
talk
it
among
themselves
very
often
,
and
see
them
shake
*NL*
their
heads
and
say
they
were
sorry
for
it
,
and
the
like
,
as
is
usual
*NL*
in
the
place
.
But
still
nobody
came
to
tell
me
their
thoughts
,
till
at
*NL*
last
one
of
the
keepers
came
to
me
privately
,
and
said
with
a
sigh
,
*NL*
`
Well
,
Mrs.
Flanders
,
you
will
be
tried
on
Friday
'
-LRB-
this
was
but
a
*NL*
Wednesday
-RRB-
;
`
what
do
you
intend
to
do
?
'
I
turned
as
white
as
a
clout
,
*NL*
and
said
,
`
God
knows
what
I
shall
do
;
for
my
part
,
I
know
not
what
to
*NL*
do
.
'
`
Why
,
'
says
he
,
'
I
wo
n't
flatter
you
,
I
would
have
you
prepare
*NL*
for
death
,
for
I
doubt
you
will
be
cast
;
and
as
they
say
you
are
an
old
*NL*
offender
,
I
doubt
you
will
find
but
little
mercy
.
They
say
,
'
added
he
,
*NL*
`
your
case
is
very
plain
,
and
that
the
witnesses
swear
so
home
against
*NL*
you
,
there
will
be
no
standing
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
a
stab
into
the
very
vitals
of
one
under
such
a
burthen
as
I
*NL*
was
oppressed
with
before
,
and
I
could
not
speak
to
him
a
word
,
good
or
*NL*
bad
,
for
a
great
while
;
but
at
last
I
burst
out
into
tears
,
and
said
to
*NL*
him
,
`
Lord
!
Mr.
--
,
what
must
I
do
?
'
`
Do
!
'
says
he
,
`
send
for
the
*NL*
ordinary
;
send
for
a
minister
and
talk
with
him
;
for
,
indeed
,
Mrs.
*NL*
Flanders
,
unless
you
have
very
good
friends
,
you
are
no
woman
for
this
*NL*
world
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
plain
dealing
indeed
,
but
it
was
very
harsh
to
me
,
at
least
I
*NL*
thought
it
so
.
He
left
me
in
the
greatest
confusion
imaginable
,
and
*NL*
all
that
night
I
lay
awake
.
And
now
I
began
to
say
my
prayers
,
which
I
*NL*
had
scarce
done
before
since
my
last
husband
's
death
,
or
from
a
little
*NL*
while
after
.
And
truly
I
may
well
call
it
saying
my
prayers
,
for
I
was
*NL*
in
such
a
confusion
,
and
had
such
horror
upon
my
mind
,
that
though
I
*NL*
cried
,
and
repeated
several
times
the
ordinary
expression
of
`
Lord
,
*NL*
have
mercy
upon
me
!
'
I
never
brought
myself
to
any
sense
of
my
being
a
*NL*
miserable
sinner
,
as
indeed
I
was
,
and
of
confessing
my
sins
to
God
,
*NL*
and
begging
pardon
for
the
sake
of
Jesus
Christ
.
I
was
overwhelmed
*NL*
with
the
sense
of
my
condition
,
being
tried
for
my
life
,
and
being
sure
*NL*
to
be
condemned
,
and
then
I
was
as
sure
to
be
executed
,
and
on
this
*NL*
account
I
cried
out
all
night
,
`
Lord
,
what
will
become
of
me
?
Lord
!
*NL*
what
shall
I
do
?
Lord
!
I
shall
be
hanged
!
Lord
,
have
mercy
upon
me
!
'
*NL*
and
the
like
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
poor
afflicted
governess
was
now
as
much
concerned
as
I
,
and
a
great
*NL*
deal
more
truly
penitent
,
though
she
had
no
prospect
of
being
brought
*NL*
to
trial
and
sentence
.
Not
but
that
she
deserved
it
as
much
as
I
,
and
*NL*
so
she
said
herself
;
but
she
had
not
done
anything
herself
for
many
*NL*
years
,
other
than
receiving
what
I
and
others
stole
,
and
encouraging
us
*NL*
to
steal
it
.
But
she
cried
,
and
took
on
like
a
distracted
body
,
*NL*
wringing
her
hands
,
and
crying
out
that
she
was
undone
,
that
she
*NL*
believed
there
was
a
curse
from
heaven
upon
her
,
that
she
should
be
*NL*
damned
,
that
she
had
been
the
destruction
of
all
her
friends
,
that
she
*NL*
had
brought
such
a
one
,
and
such
a
one
,
and
such
a
one
to
the
gallows
;
*NL*
and
there
she
reckoned
up
ten
or
eleven
people
,
some
of
which
I
have
*NL*
given
account
of
,
that
came
to
untimely
ends
;
and
that
now
she
was
the
*NL*
occasion
of
my
ruin
,
for
she
had
persuaded
me
to
go
on
,
when
I
would
*NL*
have
left
off
.
I
interrupted
her
there
.
`
No
,
mother
,
no
,
'
said
I
,
*NL*
`
do
n't
speak
of
that
,
for
you
would
have
had
me
left
off
when
I
got
the
*NL*
mercer
's
money
again
,
and
when
I
came
home
from
Harwich
,
and
I
would
*NL*
not
hearken
to
you
;
therefore
you
have
not
been
to
blame
;
it
is
I
only
*NL*
have
ruined
myself
,
I
have
brought
myself
to
this
misery
'
;
and
thus
we
*NL*
spent
many
hours
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
there
was
no
remedy
;
the
prosecution
went
on
,
and
on
the
Thursday
*NL*
I
was
carried
down
to
the
sessions-house
,
where
I
was
arraigned
,
as
*NL*
they
called
it
,
and
the
next
day
I
was
appointed
to
be
tried
.
At
the
*NL*
arraignment
I
pleaded
`
Not
guilty
,
'
and
well
I
might
,
for
I
was
*NL*
indicted
for
felony
and
burglary
;
that
is
,
for
feloniously
stealing
two
*NL*
pieces
of
brocaded
silk
,
value
#
46
,
the
goods
of
Anthony
Johnson
,
and
*NL*
for
breaking
open
his
doors
;
whereas
I
knew
very
well
they
could
not
*NL*
pretend
to
prove
I
had
broken
up
the
doors
,
or
so
much
as
lifted
up
a
*NL*
latch
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
Friday
I
was
brought
to
my
trial
.
I
had
exhausted
my
spirits
*NL*
with
crying
for
two
or
three
days
before
,
so
that
I
slept
better
the
*NL*
Thursday
night
than
I
expected
,
and
had
more
courage
for
my
trial
than
*NL*
indeed
I
thought
possible
for
me
to
have
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
trial
began
,
the
indictment
was
read
,
I
would
have
spoke
,
but
*NL*
they
told
me
the
witnesses
must
be
heard
first
,
and
then
I
should
have
*NL*
time
to
be
heard
.
The
witnesses
were
the
two
wenches
,
a
couple
of
*NL*
hard-mouthed
jades
indeed
,
for
though
the
thing
was
truth
in
the
main
,
*NL*
yet
they
aggravated
it
to
the
utmost
extremity
,
and
swore
I
had
the
*NL*
goods
wholly
in
my
possession
,
that
I
had
hid
them
among
my
clothes
,
*NL*
that
I
was
going
off
with
them
,
that
I
had
one
foot
over
the
threshold
*NL*
when
they
discovered
themselves
,
and
then
I
put
t
'
other
over
,
so
that
*NL*
I
was
quite
out
of
the
house
in
the
street
with
the
goods
before
they
*NL*
took
hold
of
me
,
and
then
they
seized
me
,
and
brought
me
back
again
,
*NL*
and
they
took
the
goods
upon
me
.
The
fact
in
general
was
all
true
,
but
*NL*
I
believe
,
and
insisted
upon
it
,
that
they
stopped
me
before
I
had
set
*NL*
my
foot
clear
of
the
threshold
of
the
house
.
But
that
did
not
argue
*NL*
much
,
for
certain
it
was
that
I
had
taken
the
goods
,
and
I
was
bringing
*NL*
them
away
,
if
I
had
not
been
taken
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
pleaded
that
I
had
stole
nothing
,
they
had
lost
nothing
,
that
the
*NL*
door
was
open
,
and
I
went
in
,
seeing
the
goods
lie
there
,
and
with
*NL*
design
to
buy
.
If
,
seeing
nobody
in
the
house
,
I
had
taken
any
of
them
*NL*
up
in
my
hand
it
could
not
be
concluded
that
I
intended
to
steal
them
,
*NL*
for
that
I
never
carried
them
farther
than
the
door
to
look
on
them
*NL*
with
the
better
light
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Court
would
not
allow
that
by
any
means
,
and
made
a
kind
of
a
jest
*NL*
of
my
intending
to
buy
the
goods
,
that
being
no
shop
for
the
selling
of
*NL*
anything
,
and
as
to
carrying
them
to
the
door
to
look
at
them
,
the
*NL*
maids
made
their
impudent
mocks
upon
that
,
and
spent
their
wit
upon
it
*NL*
very
much
;
told
the
Court
I
had
looked
at
them
sufficiently
,
and
*NL*
approved
them
very
well
,
for
I
had
packed
them
up
under
my
clothes
,
and
*NL*
was
a-going
with
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
short
,
I
was
found
guilty
of
felony
,
but
acquitted
of
the
burglary
,
*NL*
which
was
but
small
comfort
to
me
,
the
first
bringing
me
to
a
sentence
*NL*
of
death
,
and
the
last
would
have
done
no
more
.
The
next
day
I
was
*NL*
carried
down
to
receive
the
dreadful
sentence
,
and
when
they
came
to
*NL*
ask
me
what
I
had
to
say
why
sentence
should
not
pass
,
I
stood
mute
a
*NL*
while
,
but
somebody
that
stood
behind
me
prompted
me
aloud
to
speak
to
*NL*
the
judges
,
for
that
they
could
represent
things
favourably
for
me
.
*NL*
This
encouraged
me
to
speak
,
and
I
told
them
I
had
nothing
to
say
to
*NL*
stop
the
sentence
,
but
that
I
had
much
to
say
to
bespeak
the
mercy
of
*NL*
the
Court
;
that
I
hoped
they
would
allow
something
in
such
a
case
for
*NL*
the
circumstances
of
it
;
that
I
had
broken
no
doors
,
had
carried
*NL*
nothing
off
;
that
nobody
had
lost
anything
;
that
the
person
whose
goods
*NL*
they
were
was
pleased
to
say
he
desired
mercy
might
be
shown
-LRB-
which
*NL*
indeed
he
very
honestly
did
-RRB-
;
that
,
at
the
worst
,
it
was
the
first
*NL*
offence
,
and
that
I
had
never
been
before
any
court
of
justice
before
;
*NL*
and
,
in
a
word
,
I
spoke
with
more
courage
that
I
thought
I
could
have
*NL*
done
,
and
in
such
a
moving
tone
,
and
though
with
tears
,
yet
not
so
many
*NL*
tears
as
to
obstruct
my
speech
,
that
I
could
see
it
moved
others
to
*NL*
tears
that
heard
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
judges
sat
grave
and
mute
,
gave
me
an
easy
hearing
,
and
time
to
say
*NL*
all
that
I
would
,
but
,
saying
neither
Yes
nor
No
to
it
,
pronounced
the
*NL*
sentence
of
death
upon
me
,
a
sentence
that
was
to
me
like
death
itself
,
*NL*
which
,
after
it
was
read
,
confounded
me
.
I
had
no
more
spirit
left
in
*NL*
me
,
I
had
no
tongue
to
speak
,
or
eyes
to
look
up
either
to
God
or
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
poor
governess
was
utterly
disconsolate
,
and
she
that
was
my
*NL*
comforter
before
,
wanted
comfort
now
herself
;
and
sometimes
mourning
,
*NL*
sometimes
raging
,
was
as
much
out
of
herself
,
as
to
all
outward
*NL*
appearance
,
as
any
mad
woman
in
Bedlam
.
Nor
was
she
only
disconsolate
*NL*
as
to
me
,
but
she
was
struck
with
horror
at
the
sense
of
her
own
wicked
*NL*
life
,
and
began
to
look
back
upon
it
with
a
taste
quite
different
from
*NL*
mine
,
for
she
was
penitent
to
the
highest
degree
for
her
sins
,
as
well
*NL*
as
sorrowful
for
the
misfortune
.
She
sent
for
a
minister
,
too
,
a
*NL*
serious
,
pious
,
good
man
,
and
applied
herself
with
such
earnestness
,
by
*NL*
his
assistance
,
to
the
work
of
a
sincere
repentance
,
that
I
believe
,
*NL*
and
so
did
the
minister
too
,
that
she
was
a
true
penitent
;
and
,
which
*NL*
is
still
more
,
she
was
not
only
so
for
the
occasion
,
and
at
that
*NL*
juncture
,
but
she
continued
so
,
as
I
was
informed
,
to
the
day
of
her
*NL*
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
rather
to
be
thought
of
than
expressed
what
was
now
my
condition
.
*NL*
I
had
nothing
before
me
but
present
death
;
and
as
I
had
no
friends
to
*NL*
assist
me
,
or
to
stir
for
me
,
I
expected
nothing
but
to
find
my
name
in
*NL*
the
dead
warrant
,
which
was
to
come
down
for
the
execution
,
the
Friday
*NL*
afterwards
,
of
five
more
and
myself
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
my
poor
distressed
governess
sent
me
a
minister
,
who
at
*NL*
her
request
first
,
and
at
my
own
afterwards
,
came
to
visit
me
.
He
*NL*
exhorted
me
seriously
to
repent
of
all
my
sins
,
and
to
dally
no
longer
*NL*
with
my
soul
;
not
flattering
myself
with
hopes
of
life
,
which
,
he
said
,
*NL*
he
was
informed
there
was
no
room
to
expect
,
but
unfeignedly
to
look
up
*NL*
to
God
with
my
whole
soul
,
and
to
cry
for
pardon
in
the
name
of
Jesus
*NL*
Christ
.
He
backed
his
discourses
with
proper
quotations
of
Scripture
,
*NL*
encouraging
the
greatest
sinner
to
repent
,
and
turn
from
their
evil
*NL*
way
,
and
when
he
had
done
,
he
kneeled
down
and
prayed
with
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
now
that
,
for
the
first
time
,
I
felt
any
real
signs
of
*NL*
repentance
.
I
now
began
to
look
back
upon
my
past
life
with
*NL*
abhorrence
,
and
having
a
kind
of
view
into
the
other
side
of
time
,
and
*NL*
things
of
life
,
as
I
believe
they
do
with
everybody
at
such
a
time
,
*NL*
began
to
look
with
a
different
aspect
,
and
quite
another
shape
,
than
*NL*
they
did
before
.
The
greatest
and
best
things
,
the
views
of
felicity
,
*NL*
the
joy
,
the
griefs
of
life
,
were
quite
other
things
;
and
I
had
nothing
*NL*
in
my
thoughts
but
what
was
so
infinitely
superior
to
what
I
had
known
*NL*
in
life
,
that
it
appeared
to
me
to
be
the
greatest
stupidity
in
nature
*NL*
to
lay
any
weight
upon
anything
,
though
the
most
valuable
in
this
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
word
eternity
represented
itself
with
all
its
incomprehensible
*NL*
additions
,
and
I
had
such
extended
notions
of
it
,
that
I
know
not
how
*NL*
to
express
them
.
Among
the
rest
,
how
vile
,
how
gross
,
how
absurd
did
*NL*
every
pleasant
thing
look
!
--
I
mean
,
that
we
had
counted
pleasant
*NL*
before
--
especially
when
I
reflected
that
these
sordid
trifles
were
the
*NL*
things
for
which
we
forfeited
eternal
felicity
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
these
reflections
came
,
of
mere
course
,
severe
reproaches
of
my
*NL*
own
mind
for
my
wretched
behaviour
in
my
past
life
;
that
I
had
*NL*
forfeited
all
hope
of
any
happiness
in
the
eternity
that
I
was
just
*NL*
going
to
enter
into
,
and
on
the
contrary
was
entitled
to
all
that
was
*NL*
miserable
,
or
had
been
conceived
of
misery
;
and
all
this
with
the
*NL*
frightful
addition
of
its
being
also
eternal
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
am
not
capable
of
reading
lectures
of
instruction
to
anybody
,
but
I
*NL*
relate
this
in
the
very
manner
in
which
things
then
appeared
to
me
,
as
*NL*
far
as
I
am
able
,
but
infinitely
short
of
the
lively
impressions
which
*NL*
they
made
on
my
soul
at
that
time
;
indeed
,
those
impressions
are
not
to
*NL*
be
explained
by
words
,
or
if
they
are
,
I
am
not
mistress
of
words
*NL*
enough
to
express
them
.
It
must
be
the
work
of
every
sober
reader
to
*NL*
make
just
reflections
on
them
,
as
their
own
circumstances
may
direct
;
*NL*
and
,
without
question
,
this
is
what
every
one
at
some
time
or
other
may
*NL*
feel
something
of
;
I
mean
,
a
clearer
sight
into
things
to
come
than
*NL*
they
had
here
,
and
a
dark
view
of
their
own
concern
in
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
go
back
to
my
own
case
.
The
minister
pressed
me
to
tell
him
,
as
*NL*
far
as
I
though
convenient
,
in
what
state
I
found
myself
as
to
the
*NL*
sight
I
had
of
things
beyond
life
.
He
told
me
he
did
not
come
as
*NL*
ordinary
of
the
place
,
whose
business
it
is
to
extort
confessions
from
*NL*
prisoners
,
for
private
ends
,
or
for
the
further
detecting
of
other
*NL*
offenders
;
that
his
business
was
to
move
me
to
such
freedom
of
*NL*
discourse
as
might
serve
to
disburthen
my
own
mind
,
and
furnish
him
to
*NL*
administer
comfort
to
me
as
far
as
was
in
his
power
;
and
assured
me
,
*NL*
that
whatever
I
said
to
him
should
remain
with
him
,
and
be
as
much
a
*NL*
secret
as
if
it
was
known
only
to
God
and
myself
;
and
that
he
desired
*NL*
to
know
nothing
of
me
,
but
as
above
to
qualify
him
to
apply
proper
*NL*
advice
and
assistance
to
me
,
and
to
pray
to
God
for
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
honest
,
friendly
way
of
treating
me
unlocked
all
the
sluices
of
my
*NL*
passions
.
He
broke
into
my
very
soul
by
it
;
and
I
unravelled
all
the
*NL*
wickedness
of
my
life
to
him
.
In
a
word
,
I
gave
him
an
abridgment
of
*NL*
this
whole
history
;
I
gave
him
a
picture
of
my
conduct
for
fifty
years
*NL*
in
miniature
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
hid
nothing
from
him
,
and
he
in
return
exhorted
me
to
sincere
*NL*
repentance
,
explained
to
me
what
he
meant
by
repentance
,
and
then
drew
*NL*
out
such
a
scheme
of
infinite
mercy
,
proclaimed
from
heaven
to
sinners
*NL*
of
the
greatest
magnitude
,
that
he
left
me
nothing
to
say
,
that
looked
*NL*
like
despair
,
or
doubting
of
being
accepted
;
and
in
this
condition
he
*NL*
left
me
the
first
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
visited
me
again
the
next
morning
,
and
went
on
with
his
method
of
*NL*
explaining
the
terms
of
divine
mercy
,
which
according
to
him
consisted
*NL*
of
nothing
more
,
or
more
difficult
,
than
that
of
being
sincerely
*NL*
desirous
of
it
,
and
willing
to
accept
it
;
only
a
sincere
regret
for
,
*NL*
and
hatred
of
,
those
things
I
had
done
,
which
rendered
me
so
just
an
*NL*
object
of
divine
vengeance
.
I
am
not
able
to
repeat
the
excellent
*NL*
discourses
of
this
extraordinary
man
;
't
is
all
that
I
am
able
to
do
,
to
*NL*
say
that
he
revived
my
heart
,
and
brought
me
into
such
a
condition
that
*NL*
I
never
knew
anything
of
in
my
life
before
.
I
was
covered
with
shame
*NL*
and
tears
for
things
past
,
and
yet
had
at
the
same
time
a
secret
*NL*
surprising
joy
at
the
prospect
of
being
a
true
penitent
,
and
obtaining
*NL*
the
comfort
of
a
penitent
--
I
mean
,
the
hope
of
being
forgiven
;
and
so
*NL*
swift
did
thoughts
circulate
,
and
so
high
did
the
impressions
they
had
*NL*
made
upon
me
run
,
that
I
thought
I
could
freely
have
gone
out
that
*NL*
minute
to
execution
,
without
any
uneasiness
at
all
,
casting
my
soul
*NL*
entirely
into
the
arms
of
infinite
mercy
as
a
penitent
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
good
gentleman
was
so
moved
also
in
my
behalf
with
a
view
of
the
*NL*
influence
which
he
saw
these
things
had
on
me
,
that
he
blessed
God
he
*NL*
had
come
to
visit
me
,
and
resolved
not
to
leave
me
till
the
last
*NL*
moment
;
that
is
,
not
to
leave
visiting
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
no
less
than
twelve
days
after
our
receiving
sentence
before
any
*NL*
were
ordered
for
execution
,
and
then
upon
a
Wednesday
the
dead
warrant
,
*NL*
as
they
call
it
,
came
down
,
and
I
found
my
name
was
among
them
.
A
*NL*
terrible
blow
this
was
to
my
new
resolutions
;
indeed
my
heart
sank
*NL*
within
me
,
and
I
swooned
away
twice
,
one
after
another
,
but
spoke
not
a
*NL*
word
.
The
good
minister
was
sorely
afflicted
for
me
,
and
did
what
he
*NL*
could
to
comfort
me
with
the
same
arguments
,
and
the
same
moving
*NL*
eloquence
that
he
did
before
,
and
left
me
not
that
evening
so
long
as
*NL*
the
prisonkeepers
would
suffer
him
to
stay
in
the
prison
,
unless
he
*NL*
would
be
locked
up
with
me
all
night
,
which
he
was
not
willing
to
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
wondered
much
that
I
did
not
see
him
all
the
next
day
,
it
being
the
*NL*
day
before
the
time
appointed
for
execution
;
and
I
was
greatly
*NL*
discouraged
,
and
dejected
in
my
mind
,
and
indeed
almost
sank
for
want
*NL*
of
the
comfort
which
he
had
so
often
,
and
with
such
success
,
yielded
me
*NL*
on
his
former
visits
.
I
waited
with
great
impatience
,
and
under
the
*NL*
greatest
oppressions
of
spirits
imaginable
,
till
about
four
o'clock
he
*NL*
came
to
my
apartment
;
for
I
had
obtained
the
favour
,
by
the
help
of
*NL*
money
,
nothing
being
to
be
done
in
that
place
without
it
,
not
to
be
*NL*
kept
in
the
condemned
hole
,
as
they
call
it
,
among
the
rest
of
the
*NL*
prisoners
who
were
to
die
,
but
to
have
a
little
dirty
chamber
to
myself
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
heart
leaped
within
me
for
joy
when
I
heard
his
voice
at
the
door
,
*NL*
even
before
I
saw
him
;
but
let
any
one
judge
what
kind
of
motion
I
*NL*
found
in
my
soul
,
when
after
having
made
a
short
excuse
for
his
not
*NL*
coming
,
he
showed
me
that
his
time
had
been
employed
on
my
account
;
*NL*
that
he
had
obtained
a
favourable
report
from
the
Recorder
to
the
*NL*
Secretary
of
State
in
my
particular
case
,
and
,
in
short
,
that
he
had
*NL*
brought
me
a
reprieve
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
used
all
the
caution
that
he
was
able
in
letting
me
know
a
thing
*NL*
which
it
would
have
been
a
double
cruelty
to
have
concealed
;
and
yet
it
*NL*
was
too
much
for
me
;
for
as
grief
had
overset
me
before
,
so
did
joy
*NL*
overset
me
now
,
and
I
fell
into
a
much
more
dangerous
swooning
than
I
*NL*
did
at
first
,
and
it
was
not
without
a
great
difficulty
that
I
was
*NL*
recovered
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
good
man
having
made
a
very
Christian
exhortation
to
me
,
not
to
let
*NL*
the
joy
of
my
reprieve
put
the
remembrance
of
my
past
sorrow
out
of
my
*NL*
mind
,
and
having
told
me
that
he
must
leave
me
,
to
go
and
enter
the
*NL*
reprieve
in
the
books
,
and
show
it
to
the
sheriffs
,
stood
up
just
*NL*
before
his
going
away
,
and
in
a
very
earnest
manner
prayed
to
God
for
*NL*
me
,
that
my
repentance
might
be
made
unfeigned
and
sincere
;
and
that
my
*NL*
coming
back
,
as
it
were
,
into
life
again
,
might
not
be
a
returning
to
*NL*
the
follies
of
life
which
I
had
made
such
solemn
resolutions
to
*NL*
forsake
,
and
to
repent
of
them
.
I
joined
heartily
in
the
petition
,
and
*NL*
must
needs
say
I
had
deeper
impressions
upon
my
mind
all
that
night
,
of
*NL*
the
mercy
of
God
in
sparing
my
life
,
and
a
greater
detestation
of
my
*NL*
past
sins
,
from
a
sense
of
the
goodness
which
I
had
tasted
in
this
*NL*
case
,
than
I
had
in
all
my
sorrow
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
may
be
thought
inconsistent
in
itself
,
and
wide
from
the
business
*NL*
of
this
book
;
particularly
,
I
reflect
that
many
of
those
who
may
be
*NL*
pleased
and
diverted
with
the
relation
of
the
wild
and
wicked
part
of
*NL*
my
story
may
not
relish
this
,
which
is
really
the
best
part
of
my
life
,
*NL*
the
most
advantageous
to
myself
,
and
the
most
instructive
to
others
.
*NL*
Such
,
however
,
will
,
I
hope
,
allow
me
the
liberty
to
make
my
story
*NL*
complete
.
It
would
be
a
severe
satire
on
such
to
say
they
do
not
*NL*
relish
the
repentance
as
much
as
they
do
the
crime
;
and
that
they
had
*NL*
rather
the
history
were
a
complete
tragedy
,
as
it
was
very
likely
to
*NL*
have
been
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
go
on
with
my
relation
.
The
next
morning
there
was
a
sad
scene
*NL*
indeed
in
the
prison
.
The
first
thing
I
was
saluted
with
in
the
*NL*
morning
was
the
tolling
of
the
great
bell
at
St.
Sepulchre
's
,
as
they
*NL*
call
it
,
which
ushered
in
the
day
.
As
soon
as
it
began
to
toll
,
a
*NL*
dismal
groaning
and
crying
was
heard
from
the
condemned
hole
,
where
*NL*
there
lay
six
poor
souls
who
were
to
be
executed
that
day
,
some
from
*NL*
one
crime
,
some
for
another
,
and
two
of
them
for
murder
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
followed
by
a
confused
clamour
in
the
house
,
among
the
several
*NL*
sorts
of
prisoners
,
expressing
their
awkward
sorrows
for
the
poor
*NL*
creatures
that
were
to
die
,
but
in
a
manner
extremely
differing
one
*NL*
from
another
.
Some
cried
for
them
;
some
huzzaed
,
and
wished
them
a
*NL*
good
journey
;
some
damned
and
cursed
those
that
had
brought
them
to
*NL*
it
--
that
is
,
meaning
the
evidence
,
or
prosecutors
--
many
pitying
them
,
*NL*
and
some
few
,
but
very
few
,
praying
for
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
hardly
room
for
so
much
composure
of
mind
as
was
required
for
*NL*
me
to
bless
the
merciful
Providence
that
had
,
as
it
were
,
snatched
me
*NL*
out
of
the
jaws
of
this
destruction
.
I
remained
,
as
it
were
,
dumb
and
*NL*
silent
,
overcome
with
the
sense
of
it
,
and
not
able
to
express
what
I
*NL*
had
in
my
heart
;
for
the
passions
on
such
occasions
as
these
are
*NL*
certainly
so
agitated
as
not
to
be
able
presently
to
regulate
their
own
*NL*
motions
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
while
the
poor
condemned
creatures
were
preparing
to
their
*NL*
death
,
and
the
ordinary
,
as
they
call
him
,
was
busy
with
them
,
*NL*
disposing
them
to
submit
to
their
sentence
--
I
say
,
all
this
while
I
was
*NL*
seized
with
a
fit
of
trembling
,
as
much
as
I
could
have
been
if
I
had
*NL*
been
in
the
same
condition
,
as
to
be
sure
the
day
before
I
expected
to
*NL*
be
;
I
was
so
violently
agitated
by
this
surprising
fit
,
that
I
shook
as
*NL*
if
it
had
been
in
the
cold
fit
of
an
ague
,
so
that
I
could
not
speak
or
*NL*
look
but
like
one
distracted
.
As
soon
as
they
were
all
put
into
carts
*NL*
and
gone
,
which
,
however
,
I
had
not
courage
enough
to
see
--
I
say
,
as
*NL*
soon
as
they
were
gone
,
I
fell
into
a
fit
of
crying
involuntarily
,
and
*NL*
without
design
,
but
as
a
mere
distemper
,
and
yet
so
violent
,
and
it
*NL*
held
me
so
long
,
that
I
knew
not
what
course
to
take
,
nor
could
I
stop
,
*NL*
or
put
a
check
to
it
,
no
,
not
with
all
the
strength
and
courage
I
had
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
fit
of
crying
held
me
near
two
hours
,
and
,
as
I
believe
,
held
me
*NL*
till
they
were
all
out
of
the
world
,
and
then
a
most
humble
,
penitent
,
*NL*
serious
kind
of
joy
succeeded
;
a
real
transport
it
was
,
or
passion
of
*NL*
joy
and
thankfulness
,
but
still
unable
to
give
vent
to
it
by
words
,
and
*NL*
in
this
I
continued
most
part
of
the
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
evening
the
good
minister
visited
me
again
,
and
then
fell
to
his
*NL*
usual
good
discourses
.
He
congratulated
my
having
a
space
yet
allowed
*NL*
me
for
repentance
,
whereas
the
state
of
those
six
poor
creatures
was
*NL*
determined
,
and
they
were
now
past
the
offers
of
salvation
;
he
*NL*
earnestly
pressed
me
to
retain
the
same
sentiments
of
the
things
of
*NL*
life
that
I
had
when
I
had
a
view
of
eternity
;
and
at
the
end
of
all
*NL*
told
me
I
should
not
conclude
that
all
was
over
,
that
a
reprieve
was
*NL*
not
a
pardon
,
that
he
could
not
yet
answer
for
the
effects
of
it
;
*NL*
however
,
I
had
this
mercy
,
that
I
had
more
time
given
me
,
and
that
it
*NL*
was
my
business
to
improve
that
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
discourse
,
though
very
seasonable
,
left
a
kind
of
sadness
on
my
*NL*
heart
,
as
if
I
might
expect
the
affair
would
have
a
tragical
issue
*NL*
still
,
which
,
however
,
he
had
no
certainty
of
;
and
I
did
not
indeed
,
at
*NL*
that
time
,
question
him
about
it
,
he
having
said
that
he
would
do
his
*NL*
utmost
to
bring
it
to
a
good
end
,
and
that
he
hoped
he
might
,
but
he
*NL*
would
not
have
me
be
secure
;
and
the
consequence
proved
that
he
had
*NL*
reason
for
what
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
about
a
fortnight
after
this
that
I
had
some
just
apprehensions
*NL*
that
I
should
be
included
in
the
next
dead
warrant
at
the
ensuing
*NL*
sessions
;
and
it
was
not
without
great
difficulty
,
and
at
last
a
humble
*NL*
petition
for
transportation
,
that
I
avoided
it
,
so
ill
was
I
beholding
*NL*
to
fame
,
and
so
prevailing
was
the
fatal
report
of
being
an
old
*NL*
offender
;
though
in
that
they
did
not
do
me
strict
justice
,
for
I
was
*NL*
not
in
the
sense
of
the
law
an
old
offender
,
whatever
I
was
in
the
eye
*NL*
of
the
judge
,
for
I
had
never
been
before
them
in
a
judicial
way
*NL*
before
;
so
the
judges
could
not
charge
me
with
being
an
old
offender
,
*NL*
but
the
Recorder
was
pleased
to
represent
my
case
as
he
thought
fit
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
now
a
certainty
of
life
indeed
,
but
with
the
hard
conditions
of
*NL*
being
ordered
for
transportation
,
which
indeed
was
hard
condition
in
*NL*
itself
,
but
not
when
comparatively
considered
;
and
therefore
I
shall
*NL*
make
no
comments
upon
the
sentence
,
nor
upon
the
choice
I
was
put
to
.
*NL*
We
shall
all
choose
anything
rather
than
death
,
especially
when
't
is
*NL*
attended
with
an
uncomfortable
prospect
beyond
it
,
which
was
my
case
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
good
minister
,
whose
interest
,
though
a
stranger
to
me
,
had
*NL*
obtained
me
the
reprieve
,
mourned
sincerely
for
this
part
.
He
was
in
*NL*
hopes
,
he
said
,
that
I
should
have
ended
my
days
under
the
influence
of
*NL*
good
instruction
,
that
I
should
not
have
been
turned
loose
again
among
*NL*
such
a
wretched
crew
as
they
generally
are
,
who
are
thus
sent
abroad
,
*NL*
where
,
as
he
said
,
I
must
have
more
than
ordinary
secret
assistance
*NL*
from
the
grace
of
God
,
if
I
did
not
turn
as
wicked
again
as
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
not
for
a
good
while
mentioned
my
governess
,
who
had
during
*NL*
most
,
if
not
all
,
of
this
part
been
dangerously
sick
,
and
being
in
as
*NL*
near
a
view
of
death
by
her
disease
as
I
was
by
my
sentence
,
was
a
*NL*
great
penitent
--
I
say
,
I
have
not
mentioned
her
,
nor
indeed
did
I
see
*NL*
her
in
all
this
time
;
but
being
now
recovering
,
and
just
able
to
come
*NL*
abroad
,
she
came
to
see
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
told
her
my
condition
,
and
what
a
different
flux
and
reflux
of
tears
*NL*
and
hopes
I
had
been
agitated
with
;
I
told
her
what
I
had
escaped
,
and
*NL*
upon
what
terms
;
and
she
was
present
when
the
minister
expressed
his
*NL*
fears
of
my
relapsing
into
wickedness
upon
my
falling
into
the
wretched
*NL*
companies
that
are
generally
transported
.
Indeed
I
had
a
melancholy
*NL*
reflection
upon
it
in
my
own
mind
,
for
I
knew
what
a
dreadful
gang
was
*NL*
always
sent
away
together
,
and
I
said
to
my
governess
that
the
good
*NL*
minister
's
fears
were
not
without
cause
.
`
Well
,
well
,
'
says
she
,
`
but
*NL*
I
hope
you
will
not
be
tempted
with
such
a
horrid
example
as
that
.
'
And
*NL*
as
soon
as
the
minister
was
gone
,
she
told
me
she
would
not
have
me
*NL*
discouraged
,
for
perhaps
ways
and
means
might
be
found
out
to
dispose
*NL*
of
me
in
a
particular
way
,
by
myself
,
of
which
she
would
talk
further
*NL*
to
me
afterward
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
looked
earnestly
at
her
,
and
I
thought
she
looked
more
cheerful
than
*NL*
she
usually
had
done
,
and
I
entertained
immediately
a
thousand
notions
*NL*
of
being
delivered
,
but
could
not
for
my
life
image
the
methods
,
or
*NL*
think
of
one
that
was
in
the
least
feasible
;
but
I
was
too
much
*NL*
concerned
in
it
to
let
her
go
from
me
without
explaining
herself
,
*NL*
which
,
though
she
was
very
loth
to
do
,
yet
my
importunity
prevailed
,
*NL*
and
,
while
I
was
still
pressing
,
she
answered
me
in
a
few
words
,
thus
:
*NL*
`
Why
,
you
have
money
,
have
you
not
?
Did
you
ever
know
one
in
your
life
*NL*
that
was
transported
and
had
a
hundred
pounds
in
his
pocket
,
I
'll
*NL*
warrant
you
,
child
?
'
says
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
understood
her
presently
,
but
told
her
I
would
leave
all
that
to
her
,
*NL*
but
I
saw
no
room
to
hope
for
anything
but
a
strict
execution
of
the
*NL*
order
,
and
as
it
was
a
severity
that
was
esteemed
a
mercy
,
there
was
no
*NL*
doubt
but
it
would
be
strictly
observed
.
She
said
no
more
but
this
:
*NL*
`
We
will
try
what
can
be
done
,
'
and
so
we
parted
for
that
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
lay
in
the
prison
near
fifteen
weeks
after
this
order
for
*NL*
transportation
was
signed
.
What
the
reason
of
it
was
,
I
know
not
,
but
*NL*
at
the
end
of
this
time
I
was
put
on
board
of
a
ship
in
the
Thames
,
and
*NL*
with
me
a
gang
of
thirteen
as
hardened
vile
creatures
as
ever
Newgate
*NL*
produced
in
my
time
;
and
it
would
really
well
take
up
a
history
longer
*NL*
than
mine
to
describe
the
degrees
of
impudence
and
audacious
villainy
*NL*
that
those
thirteen
were
arrived
to
,
and
the
manner
of
their
behaviour
*NL*
in
the
voyage
;
of
which
I
have
a
very
diverting
account
by
me
,
which
*NL*
the
captain
of
the
ship
who
carried
them
over
gave
me
the
minutes
of
,
*NL*
and
which
he
caused
his
mate
to
write
down
at
large
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
may
perhaps
be
thought
trifling
to
enter
here
into
a
relation
of
all
*NL*
the
little
incidents
which
attended
me
in
this
interval
of
my
*NL*
circumstances
;
I
mean
,
between
the
final
order
of
my
transportation
and
*NL*
the
time
of
my
going
on
board
the
ship
;
and
I
am
too
near
the
end
of
my
*NL*
story
to
allow
room
for
it
;
but
something
relating
to
me
and
my
*NL*
Lancashire
husband
I
must
not
omit
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
,
as
I
have
observed
already
,
been
carried
from
the
master
's
side
*NL*
of
the
ordinary
prison
into
the
press-yard
,
with
three
of
his
comrades
,
*NL*
for
they
found
another
to
add
to
them
after
some
time
;
here
,
for
what
*NL*
reason
I
knew
not
,
they
were
kept
in
custody
without
being
brought
to
*NL*
trial
almost
three
months
.
It
seems
they
found
means
to
bribe
or
buy
*NL*
off
some
of
those
who
were
expected
to
come
in
against
them
,
and
they
*NL*
wanted
evidence
for
some
time
to
convict
them
.
After
some
puzzle
on
*NL*
this
account
,
at
first
they
made
a
shift
to
get
proof
enough
against
*NL*
two
of
them
to
carry
them
off
;
but
the
other
two
,
of
which
my
*NL*
Lancashire
husband
was
one
,
lay
still
in
suspense
.
They
had
,
I
think
,
*NL*
one
positive
evidence
against
each
of
them
,
but
the
law
strictly
*NL*
obliging
them
to
have
two
witnesses
,
they
could
make
nothing
of
it
.
*NL*
Yet
it
seems
they
were
resolved
not
to
part
with
the
men
neither
,
not
*NL*
doubting
but
a
further
evidence
would
at
last
come
in
;
and
in
order
to
*NL*
this
,
I
think
publication
was
made
,
that
such
prisoners
being
taken
,
*NL*
any
one
that
had
been
robbed
by
them
might
come
to
the
prison
and
see
*NL*
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
took
this
opportunity
to
satisfy
my
curiosity
,
pretending
that
I
had
*NL*
been
robbed
in
the
Dunstable
coach
,
and
that
I
would
go
to
see
the
two
*NL*
highwaymen
.
But
when
I
came
into
the
press-yard
,
I
so
disguised
*NL*
myself
,
and
muffled
my
face
up
so
,
that
he
could
see
little
of
me
,
and
*NL*
consequently
knew
nothing
of
who
I
was
;
and
when
I
came
back
,
I
said
*NL*
publicly
that
I
knew
them
very
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
Immediately
it
was
rumoured
all
over
the
prison
that
Moll
Flanders
*NL*
would
turn
evidence
against
one
of
the
highwaymen
,
and
that
I
was
to
*NL*
come
off
by
it
from
the
sentence
of
transportation
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
heard
of
it
,
and
immediately
my
husband
desired
to
see
this
Mrs.
*NL*
Flanders
that
knew
him
so
well
,
and
was
to
be
an
evidence
against
him
;
*NL*
and
accordingly
I
had
leave
given
to
go
to
him
.
I
dressed
myself
up
as
*NL*
well
as
the
best
clothes
that
I
suffered
myself
ever
to
appear
in
there
*NL*
would
allow
me
,
and
went
to
the
press-yard
,
but
had
for
some
time
a
*NL*
hood
over
my
face
.
He
said
little
to
me
at
first
,
but
asked
me
if
I
*NL*
knew
him
.
I
told
him
,
Yes
,
very
well
;
but
as
I
concealed
my
face
,
so
I
*NL*
counterfeited
my
voice
,
that
he
had
not
the
least
guess
at
who
I
was
.
*NL*
He
asked
me
where
I
had
seen
him
.
I
told
him
between
Dunstable
and
*NL*
Brickhill
;
but
turning
to
the
keeper
that
stood
by
,
I
asked
if
I
might
*NL*
not
be
admitted
to
talk
with
him
alone
.
He
said
Yes
,
yes
,
as
much
as
I
*NL*
pleased
,
and
so
very
civilly
withdrew
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
he
was
gone
,
I
had
shut
the
door
,
I
threw
off
my
hood
,
and
*NL*
bursting
out
into
tears
,
`
My
dear
,
'
says
I
,
`
do
you
not
know
me
?
'
He
*NL*
turned
pale
,
and
stood
speechless
,
like
one
thunderstruck
,
and
,
not
*NL*
able
to
conquer
the
surprise
,
said
no
more
but
this
,
`
Let
me
sit
down
'
;
*NL*
and
sitting
down
by
a
table
,
he
laid
his
elbow
upon
the
table
,
and
*NL*
leaning
his
head
on
his
hand
,
fixed
his
eyes
on
the
ground
as
one
*NL*
stupid
.
I
cried
so
vehemently
,
on
the
other
hand
,
that
it
was
a
good
*NL*
while
ere
I
could
speak
any
more
;
but
after
I
had
given
some
vent
to
my
*NL*
passion
by
tears
,
I
repeated
the
same
words
,
`
My
dear
,
do
you
not
know
*NL*
me
?
'
At
which
he
answered
,
Yes
,
and
said
no
more
a
good
while
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
some
time
continuing
in
the
surprise
,
as
above
,
he
cast
up
his
*NL*
eyes
towards
me
and
said
,
`
How
could
you
be
so
cruel
?
'
I
did
not
*NL*
readily
understand
what
he
meant
;
and
I
answered
,
`
How
can
you
call
me
*NL*
cruel
?
What
have
I
been
cruel
to
you
in
?
'
`
To
come
to
me
,
'
says
he
,
*NL*
`
in
such
a
place
as
this
,
is
it
not
to
insult
me
?
I
have
not
robbed
*NL*
you
,
at
least
not
on
the
highway
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
perceived
by
this
that
he
knew
nothing
of
the
miserable
circumstances
*NL*
I
was
in
,
and
thought
that
,
having
got
some
intelligence
of
his
being
*NL*
there
,
I
had
come
to
upbraid
him
with
his
leaving
me
.
But
I
had
too
*NL*
much
to
say
to
him
to
be
affronted
,
and
told
him
in
few
words
,
that
I
*NL*
was
far
from
coming
to
insult
him
,
but
at
best
I
came
to
condole
*NL*
mutually
;
that
he
would
be
easily
satisfied
that
I
had
no
such
view
,
*NL*
when
I
should
tell
him
that
my
condition
was
worse
than
his
,
and
that
*NL*
many
ways
.
He
looked
a
little
concerned
at
the
general
expression
of
*NL*
my
condition
being
worse
than
his
,
but
,
with
a
kind
smile
,
looked
a
*NL*
little
wildly
,
and
said
,
`
How
can
that
be
?
When
you
see
me
fettered
,
*NL*
and
in
Newgate
,
and
two
of
my
companions
executed
already
,
can
you
can
*NL*
your
condition
is
worse
than
mine
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Come
,
my
dear
,
'
says
I
,
`
we
have
a
long
piece
of
work
to
do
,
if
I
*NL*
should
be
to
relate
,
or
you
to
hear
,
my
unfortunate
history
;
but
if
you
*NL*
are
disposed
to
hear
it
,
you
will
soon
conclude
with
me
that
my
*NL*
condition
is
worse
than
yours
.
'
`
How
is
that
possible
,
'
says
he
again
,
*NL*
`
when
I
expect
to
be
cast
for
my
life
the
very
next
sessions
?
'
`
Yes
,
*NL*
says
I
,
''
tis
very
possible
,
when
I
shall
tell
you
that
I
have
been
*NL*
cast
for
my
life
three
sessions
ago
,
and
am
under
sentence
of
death
;
is
*NL*
not
my
case
worse
than
yours
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
Then
indeed
,
he
stood
silent
again
,
like
one
struck
dumb
,
and
after
a
*NL*
while
he
starts
up
.
`
Unhappy
couple
!
'
says
he
.
`
How
can
this
be
*NL*
possible
?
'
I
took
him
by
the
hand
.
`
Come
,
my
dear
,
'
said
I
,
`
sit
*NL*
down
,
and
let
us
compare
our
sorrows
.
I
am
a
prisoner
in
this
very
*NL*
house
,
and
in
much
worse
circumstances
than
you
,
and
you
will
be
*NL*
satisfied
I
do
not
come
to
insult
you
,
when
I
tell
you
the
*NL*
particulars
.
'
And
with
this
we
sat
down
together
,
and
I
told
him
so
*NL*
much
of
my
story
as
I
thought
was
convenient
,
bringing
it
at
last
to
my
*NL*
being
reduced
to
great
poverty
,
and
representing
myself
as
fallen
into
*NL*
some
company
that
led
me
to
relieve
my
distresses
by
way
that
I
had
*NL*
been
utterly
unacquainted
with
,
and
that
they
making
an
attempt
at
a
*NL*
tradesman
's
house
,
I
was
seized
upon
for
having
been
but
just
at
the
*NL*
door
,
the
maid-servant
pulling
me
in
;
that
I
neither
had
broke
any
lock
*NL*
nor
taken
anything
away
,
and
that
notwithstanding
that
,
I
was
brought
*NL*
in
guilty
and
sentenced
to
die
;
but
that
the
judges
,
having
been
made
*NL*
sensible
of
the
hardship
of
my
circumstances
,
had
obtained
leave
to
*NL*
remit
the
sentence
upon
my
consenting
to
be
transported
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
told
him
I
fared
the
worse
for
being
taken
in
the
prison
for
one
Moll
*NL*
Flanders
,
who
was
a
famous
successful
thief
,
that
all
of
them
had
heard
*NL*
of
,
but
none
of
them
had
ever
seen
;
but
that
,
as
he
knew
well
,
was
none
*NL*
of
my
name
.
But
I
placed
all
to
the
account
of
my
ill
fortune
,
and
*NL*
that
under
this
name
I
was
dealt
with
as
an
old
offender
,
though
this
*NL*
was
the
first
thing
they
had
ever
known
of
me
.
I
gave
him
a
long
*NL*
particular
of
things
that
had
befallen
me
since
I
saw
him
,
but
I
told
*NL*
him
if
I
had
seen
him
since
he
might
think
I
had
,
and
then
gave
him
an
*NL*
account
how
I
had
seen
him
at
Brickhill
;
how
furiously
he
was
pursued
,
*NL*
and
how
,
by
giving
an
account
that
I
knew
him
,
and
that
he
was
a
very
*NL*
honest
gentleman
,
one
Mr.
--
,
the
hue-and-cry
was
stopped
,
and
the
*NL*
high
constable
went
back
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
listened
most
attentively
to
all
my
story
,
and
smiled
at
most
of
the
*NL*
particulars
,
being
all
of
them
petty
matters
,
and
infinitely
below
what
*NL*
he
had
been
at
the
head
of
;
but
when
I
came
to
the
story
of
Brickhill
,
*NL*
he
was
surprised
.
`
And
was
it
you
,
my
dear
,
'
said
he
,
`
that
gave
the
*NL*
check
to
the
mob
that
was
at
our
heels
there
,
at
Brickhill
?
'
`
Yes
,
'
*NL*
said
I
,
`
it
was
I
indeed
.
'
And
then
I
told
him
the
particulars
which
I
*NL*
had
observed
him
there
.
`
Why
,
then
,
'
said
he
,
`
it
was
you
that
saved
*NL*
my
life
at
that
time
,
and
I
am
glad
I
owe
my
life
to
you
,
for
I
will
*NL*
pay
the
debt
to
you
now
,
and
I
'll
deliver
you
from
the
present
*NL*
condition
you
are
in
,
or
I
will
die
in
the
attempt
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
told
him
,
by
no
means
;
it
was
a
risk
too
great
,
not
worth
his
running
*NL*
the
hazard
of
,
and
for
a
life
not
worth
his
saving
.
'T
was
no
matter
*NL*
for
that
,
he
said
,
it
was
a
life
worth
all
the
world
to
him
;
a
life
*NL*
that
had
given
him
a
new
life
;
`
for
,
'
says
he
,
'
I
was
never
in
real
*NL*
danger
of
being
taken
,
but
that
time
,
till
the
last
minute
when
I
was
*NL*
taken
.
'
Indeed
,
he
told
me
his
danger
then
lay
in
his
believing
he
had
*NL*
not
been
pursued
that
way
;
for
they
had
gone
from
Hockey
quite
another
*NL*
way
,
and
had
come
over
the
enclosed
country
into
Brickhill
,
not
by
the
*NL*
road
,
and
were
sure
they
had
not
been
seen
by
anybody
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
he
gave
me
a
long
history
of
his
life
,
which
indeed
would
make
a
*NL*
very
strange
history
,
and
be
infinitely
diverting
.
He
told
me
he
took
*NL*
to
the
road
about
twelve
years
before
he
married
me
;
that
the
woman
*NL*
which
called
him
brother
was
not
really
his
sister
,
or
any
kin
to
him
,
*NL*
but
one
that
belonged
to
their
gang
,
and
who
,
keeping
correspondence
*NL*
with
him
,
lived
always
in
town
,
having
good
store
of
acquaintance
;
that
*NL*
she
gave
them
a
perfect
intelligence
of
persons
going
out
of
town
,
and
*NL*
that
they
had
made
several
good
booties
by
her
correspondence
;
that
she
*NL*
thought
she
had
fixed
a
fortune
for
him
when
she
brought
me
to
him
,
but
*NL*
happened
to
be
disappointed
,
which
he
really
could
not
blame
her
for
;
*NL*
that
if
it
had
been
his
good
luck
that
I
had
had
the
estate
,
which
she
*NL*
was
informed
I
had
,
he
had
resolved
to
leave
off
the
road
and
live
a
*NL*
retired
,
sober
live
but
never
to
appear
in
public
till
some
general
*NL*
pardon
had
been
passed
,
or
till
he
could
,
for
money
,
have
got
his
name
*NL*
into
some
particular
pardon
,
that
so
he
might
have
been
perfectly
easy
;
*NL*
but
that
,
as
it
had
proved
otherwise
,
he
was
obliged
to
put
off
his
*NL*
equipage
and
take
up
the
old
trade
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
gave
me
a
long
account
of
some
of
his
adventures
,
and
particularly
*NL*
one
when
he
robbed
the
West
Chester
coaches
near
Lichfield
,
when
he
got
*NL*
a
very
great
booty
;
and
after
that
,
how
he
robbed
five
graziers
,
in
the
*NL*
west
,
going
to
Burford
Fair
in
Wiltshire
to
buy
sheep
.
He
told
me
he
*NL*
got
so
much
money
on
those
two
occasions
,
that
if
he
had
known
where
to
*NL*
have
found
me
,
he
would
certainly
have
embraced
my
proposal
of
going
*NL*
with
me
to
Virginia
,
or
to
have
settled
in
a
plantation
on
some
other
*NL*
parts
of
the
English
colonies
in
America
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
told
me
he
wrote
two
or
three
letters
to
me
,
directed
according
to
*NL*
my
order
,
but
heard
nothing
from
me
.
This
I
indeed
knew
to
be
true
,
*NL*
but
the
letters
coming
to
my
hand
in
the
time
of
my
latter
husband
,
I
*NL*
could
do
nothing
in
it
,
and
therefore
chose
to
give
no
answer
,
that
so
*NL*
he
might
rather
believe
they
had
miscarried
.
*NL*
*NL*
Being
thus
disappointed
,
he
said
,
he
carried
on
the
old
trade
ever
*NL*
since
,
though
when
he
had
gotten
so
much
money
,
he
said
,
he
did
not
run
*NL*
such
desperate
risks
as
he
did
before
.
Then
he
gave
me
some
account
of
*NL*
several
hard
and
desperate
encounters
which
he
had
with
gentlemen
on
*NL*
the
road
,
who
parted
too
hardly
with
their
money
,
and
showed
me
some
*NL*
wounds
he
had
received
;
and
he
had
one
or
two
very
terrible
wounds
*NL*
indeed
,
as
particularly
one
by
a
pistol
bullet
,
which
broke
his
arm
,
*NL*
and
another
with
a
sword
,
which
ran
him
quite
through
the
body
,
but
*NL*
that
missing
his
vitals
,
he
was
cured
again
;
one
of
his
comrades
having
*NL*
kept
with
him
so
faithfully
,
and
so
friendly
,
as
that
he
assisted
him
*NL*
in
riding
near
eighty
miles
before
his
arm
was
set
,
and
then
got
a
*NL*
surgeon
in
a
considerable
city
,
remote
from
that
place
where
it
was
*NL*
done
,
pretending
they
were
gentlemen
travelling
towards
Carlisle
and
*NL*
that
they
had
been
attacked
on
the
road
by
highwaymen
,
and
that
one
of
*NL*
them
had
shot
him
into
the
arm
and
broke
the
bone
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
,
he
said
,
his
friend
managed
so
well
,
that
they
were
not
suspected
*NL*
at
all
,
but
lay
still
till
he
was
perfectly
cured
.
He
gave
me
so
many
*NL*
distinct
accounts
of
his
adventures
,
that
it
is
with
great
reluctance
*NL*
that
I
decline
the
relating
them
;
but
I
consider
that
this
is
my
own
*NL*
story
,
not
his
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
then
inquired
into
the
circumstances
of
his
present
case
at
that
*NL*
time
,
and
what
it
was
he
expected
when
he
came
to
be
tried
.
He
told
me
*NL*
that
they
had
no
evidence
against
him
,
or
but
very
little
;
for
that
of
*NL*
three
robberies
,
which
they
were
all
charged
with
,
it
was
his
good
*NL*
fortune
that
he
was
but
in
one
of
them
,
and
that
there
was
but
one
*NL*
witness
to
be
had
for
that
fact
,
which
was
not
sufficient
,
but
that
it
*NL*
was
expected
some
others
would
come
in
against
him
;
that
he
thought
*NL*
indeed
,
when
he
first
saw
me
,
that
I
had
been
one
that
came
of
that
*NL*
errand
;
but
that
if
somebody
came
in
against
him
,
he
hoped
he
should
be
*NL*
cleared
;
that
he
had
had
some
intimation
,
that
if
he
would
submit
to
*NL*
transport
himself
,
he
might
be
admitted
to
it
without
a
trial
,
but
that
*NL*
he
could
not
think
of
it
with
any
temper
,
and
thought
he
could
much
*NL*
easier
submit
to
be
hanged
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
blamed
him
for
that
,
and
told
him
I
blamed
him
on
two
accounts
;
*NL*
first
,
because
if
he
was
transported
,
there
might
be
a
hundred
ways
for
*NL*
him
that
was
a
gentleman
,
and
a
bold
enterprising
man
,
to
find
his
way
*NL*
back
again
,
and
perhaps
some
ways
and
means
to
come
back
before
he
*NL*
went
.
He
smiled
at
that
part
,
and
said
he
should
like
the
last
the
*NL*
best
of
the
two
,
for
he
had
a
kind
of
horror
upon
his
mind
at
his
being
*NL*
sent
over
to
the
plantations
,
as
Romans
sent
condemned
slaves
to
work
*NL*
in
the
mines
;
that
he
thought
the
passage
into
another
state
,
let
it
be
*NL*
what
it
would
,
much
more
tolerable
at
the
gallows
,
and
that
this
was
*NL*
the
general
notion
of
all
the
gentlemen
who
were
driven
by
the
exigence
*NL*
of
their
fortunes
to
take
the
road
;
that
at
the
place
of
execution
*NL*
there
was
at
least
an
end
of
all
the
miseries
of
the
present
state
,
and
*NL*
as
for
what
was
to
follow
,
a
man
was
,
in
his
opinion
,
as
likely
to
*NL*
repent
sincerely
in
the
last
fortnight
of
his
life
,
under
the
pressures
*NL*
and
agonies
of
a
jail
and
the
condemned
hole
,
as
he
would
ever
be
in
*NL*
the
woods
and
wilderness
of
America
;
that
servitude
and
hard
labour
*NL*
were
things
gentlemen
could
never
stoop
to
;
that
it
was
but
the
way
to
*NL*
force
them
to
be
their
own
executioners
afterwards
,
which
was
much
*NL*
worse
;
and
that
therefore
he
could
not
have
any
patience
when
he
did
*NL*
but
think
of
being
transported
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
used
the
utmost
of
my
endeavour
to
persuade
him
,
and
joined
that
*NL*
known
woman
's
rhetoric
to
it
--
I
mean
,
that
of
tears
.
I
told
him
the
*NL*
infamy
of
a
public
execution
was
certainly
a
greater
pressure
upon
the
*NL*
spirits
of
a
gentleman
than
any
of
the
mortifications
that
he
could
*NL*
meet
with
abroad
could
be
;
that
he
had
at
least
in
the
other
a
chance
*NL*
for
his
life
,
whereas
here
he
had
none
at
all
;
that
it
was
the
easiest
*NL*
thing
in
the
world
for
him
to
manage
the
captain
of
a
ship
,
who
were
,
*NL*
generally
speaking
,
men
of
good-humour
and
some
gallantry
;
and
a
small
*NL*
matter
of
conduct
,
especially
if
there
was
any
money
to
be
had
,
would
*NL*
make
way
for
him
to
buy
himself
off
when
he
came
to
Virginia
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
wistfully
at
me
,
and
I
thought
I
guessed
at
what
he
meant
,
*NL*
that
is
to
say
,
that
he
had
no
money
;
but
I
was
mistaken
,
his
meaning
*NL*
was
another
way
.
`
You
hinted
just
now
,
my
dear
,
'
said
he
,
`
that
there
*NL*
might
be
a
way
of
coming
back
before
I
went
,
by
which
I
understood
you
*NL*
that
it
might
be
possible
to
buy
it
off
here
.
I
had
rather
give
#
200
*NL*
to
prevent
going
,
than
#
100
to
be
set
at
liberty
when
I
came
there
.
'
*NL*
`
That
is
,
my
dear
,
'
said
I
,
`
because
you
do
not
know
the
place
so
well
*NL*
as
I
do
.
'
`
That
may
be
,
'
said
he
;
`
and
yet
I
believe
,
as
well
as
you
*NL*
know
it
,
you
would
do
the
same
,
unless
it
is
because
,
as
you
told
me
,
*NL*
you
have
a
mother
there
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
told
him
,
as
to
my
mother
,
it
was
next
to
impossible
but
that
she
*NL*
must
be
dead
many
years
before
;
and
as
for
any
other
relations
that
I
*NL*
might
have
there
,
I
knew
them
not
now
;
that
since
the
misfortunes
I
had
*NL*
been
under
had
reduced
me
to
the
condition
I
had
been
in
for
some
*NL*
years
,
I
had
not
kept
up
any
correspondence
with
them
;
and
that
he
*NL*
would
easily
believe
,
I
should
find
but
a
cold
reception
from
them
if
I
*NL*
should
be
put
to
make
my
first
visit
in
the
condition
of
a
transported
*NL*
felon
;
that
therefore
,
if
I
went
thither
,
I
resolved
not
to
see
them
;
*NL*
but
that
I
had
many
views
in
going
there
,
if
it
should
be
my
fate
,
*NL*
which
took
off
all
the
uneasy
part
of
it
;
and
if
he
found
himself
*NL*
obliged
to
go
also
,
I
should
easily
instruct
him
how
to
manage
himself
,
*NL*
so
as
never
to
go
a
servant
at
all
,
especially
since
I
found
he
was
not
*NL*
destitute
of
money
,
which
was
the
only
friend
in
such
a
condition
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
smiled
,
and
said
he
did
not
tell
me
he
had
money
.
I
took
him
up
*NL*
short
,
and
told
him
I
hoped
he
did
not
understand
by
my
speaking
,
that
*NL*
I
should
expect
any
supply
from
him
if
he
had
money
;
that
,
on
the
other
*NL*
hand
,
though
I
had
not
a
great
deal
,
yet
I
did
not
want
,
and
while
I
*NL*
had
any
I
would
rather
add
to
him
than
weaken
him
in
that
article
,
*NL*
seeing
,
whatever
he
had
,
I
knew
in
the
case
of
transportation
he
would
*NL*
have
occasion
of
it
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
expressed
himself
in
a
most
tender
manner
upon
that
head
.
He
told
*NL*
me
what
money
he
had
was
not
a
great
deal
,
but
that
he
would
never
hide
*NL*
any
of
it
from
me
if
I
wanted
it
,
and
that
he
assured
me
he
did
not
*NL*
speak
with
any
such
apprehensions
;
that
he
was
only
intent
upon
what
I
*NL*
had
hinted
to
him
before
he
went
;
that
here
he
knew
what
to
do
with
*NL*
himself
,
but
that
there
he
should
be
the
most
ignorant
,
helpless
wretch
*NL*
alive
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
told
him
he
frighted
and
terrified
himself
with
that
which
had
no
*NL*
terror
in
it
;
that
if
he
had
money
,
as
I
was
glad
to
hear
he
had
,
he
*NL*
might
not
only
avoid
the
servitude
supposed
to
be
the
consequence
of
*NL*
transportation
,
but
begin
the
world
upon
a
new
foundation
,
and
that
*NL*
such
a
one
as
he
could
not
fail
of
success
in
,
with
the
common
*NL*
application
usual
in
such
cases
;
that
he
could
not
but
call
to
mind
*NL*
that
is
was
what
I
had
recommended
to
him
many
years
before
and
had
*NL*
proposed
it
for
our
mutual
subsistence
and
restoring
our
fortunes
in
*NL*
the
world
;
and
I
would
tell
him
now
,
that
to
convince
him
both
of
the
*NL*
certainty
of
it
and
of
my
being
fully
acquainted
with
the
method
,
and
*NL*
also
fully
satisfied
in
the
probability
of
success
,
he
should
first
see
*NL*
me
deliver
myself
from
the
necessity
of
going
over
at
all
,
and
then
*NL*
that
I
would
go
with
him
freely
,
and
of
my
own
choice
,
and
perhaps
*NL*
carry
enough
with
me
to
satisfy
him
that
I
did
not
offer
it
for
want
of
*NL*
being
able
to
live
without
assistance
from
him
,
but
that
I
thought
our
*NL*
mutual
misfortunes
had
been
such
as
were
sufficient
to
reconcile
us
*NL*
both
to
quitting
this
part
of
the
world
,
and
living
where
nobody
could
*NL*
upbraid
us
with
what
was
past
,
or
we
be
in
any
dread
of
a
prison
,
and
*NL*
without
agonies
of
a
condemned
hole
to
drive
us
to
it
;
this
where
we
*NL*
should
look
back
on
all
our
past
disasters
with
infinite
satisfaction
,
*NL*
when
we
should
consider
that
our
enemies
should
entirely
forget
us
,
and
*NL*
that
we
should
live
as
new
people
in
a
new
world
,
nobody
having
*NL*
anything
to
say
to
us
,
or
we
to
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
pressed
this
home
to
him
with
so
many
arguments
,
and
answered
all
his
*NL*
own
passionate
objections
so
effectually
that
he
embraced
me
,
and
told
*NL*
me
I
treated
him
with
such
sincerity
and
affection
as
overcame
him
;
*NL*
that
he
would
take
my
advice
,
and
would
strive
to
submit
to
his
fate
in
*NL*
hope
of
having
the
comfort
of
my
assistance
,
and
of
so
faithful
a
*NL*
counsellor
and
such
a
companion
in
his
misery
.
But
still
he
put
me
in
*NL*
mind
of
what
I
had
mentioned
before
,
namely
,
that
there
might
be
some
*NL*
way
to
get
off
before
he
went
,
and
that
it
might
be
possible
to
avoid
*NL*
going
at
all
,
which
he
said
would
be
much
better
.
I
told
him
he
should
*NL*
see
,
and
be
fully
satisfied
,
that
I
would
do
my
utmost
in
that
part
*NL*
too
,
and
if
it
did
not
succeed
,
yet
that
I
would
make
good
the
rest
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
parted
after
this
long
conference
with
such
testimonies
of
kindness
*NL*
and
affection
as
I
thought
were
equal
,
if
not
superior
,
to
that
at
our
*NL*
parting
at
Dunstable
;
and
now
I
saw
more
plainly
than
before
,
the
*NL*
reason
why
he
declined
coming
at
that
time
any
farther
with
me
toward
*NL*
London
than
Dunstable
,
and
why
,
when
we
parted
there
,
he
told
me
it
was
*NL*
not
convenient
for
him
to
come
part
of
the
way
to
London
to
bring
me
*NL*
going
,
as
he
would
otherwise
have
done
.
I
have
observed
that
the
*NL*
account
of
his
life
would
have
made
a
much
more
pleasing
history
than
*NL*
this
of
mine
;
and
,
indeed
,
nothing
in
it
was
more
strange
than
this
*NL*
part
,
viz
.
that
he
carried
on
that
desperate
trade
full
five-and-twenty
*NL*
years
and
had
never
been
taken
,
the
success
he
had
met
with
had
been
so
*NL*
very
uncommon
,
and
such
that
sometimes
he
had
lived
handsomely
,
and
*NL*
retired
in
place
for
a
year
or
two
at
a
time
,
keeping
himself
and
a
*NL*
man-servant
to
wait
on
him
,
and
had
often
sat
in
the
coffee-houses
and
*NL*
heard
the
very
people
whom
he
had
robbed
give
accounts
of
their
being
*NL*
robbed
,
and
of
the
place
and
circumstances
,
so
that
he
could
easily
*NL*
remember
that
it
was
the
same
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
manner
,
it
seems
,
he
lived
near
Liverpool
at
the
time
he
*NL*
unluckily
married
me
for
a
fortune
.
Had
I
been
the
fortune
he
*NL*
expected
,
I
verily
believe
,
as
he
said
,
that
he
would
have
taken
up
and
*NL*
lived
honestly
all
his
days
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
with
the
rest
of
his
misfortunes
the
good
luck
not
to
be
*NL*
actually
upon
the
spot
when
the
robbery
was
done
which
he
was
committed
*NL*
for
,
and
so
none
of
the
persons
robbed
could
swear
to
him
,
or
had
*NL*
anything
to
charge
upon
him
.
But
it
seems
as
he
was
taken
with
the
*NL*
gang
,
one
hard-mouthed
countryman
swore
home
to
him
,
and
they
were
like
*NL*
to
have
others
come
in
according
to
the
publication
they
had
made
;
so
*NL*
that
they
expected
more
evidence
against
him
,
and
for
that
reason
he
*NL*
was
kept
in
hold
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
the
offer
which
was
made
to
him
of
admitting
him
to
*NL*
transportation
was
made
,
as
I
understood
,
upon
the
intercession
of
some
*NL*
great
person
who
pressed
him
hard
to
accept
of
it
before
a
trial
;
and
*NL*
indeed
,
as
he
knew
there
were
several
that
might
come
in
against
him
,
I
*NL*
thought
his
friend
was
in
the
right
,
and
I
lay
at
him
night
and
day
to
*NL*
delay
it
no
longer
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
,
with
much
difficulty
,
he
gave
his
consent
;
and
as
he
was
not
*NL*
therefore
admitted
to
transportation
in
court
,
and
on
his
petition
,
as
*NL*
I
was
,
so
he
found
himself
under
a
difficulty
to
avoid
embarking
*NL*
himself
as
I
had
said
he
might
have
done
;
his
great
friend
,
who
was
his
*NL*
intercessor
for
the
favour
of
that
grant
,
having
given
security
for
him
*NL*
that
he
should
transport
himself
,
and
not
return
within
the
term
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
hardship
broke
all
my
measures
,
for
the
steps
I
took
afterwards
*NL*
for
my
own
deliverance
were
hereby
rendered
wholly
ineffectual
,
unless
*NL*
I
would
abandon
him
,
and
leave
him
to
go
to
America
by
himself
;
than
*NL*
which
he
protested
he
would
much
rather
venture
,
although
he
were
*NL*
certain
to
go
directly
to
the
gallows
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
must
now
return
to
my
case
.
The
time
of
my
being
transported
*NL*
according
to
my
sentence
was
near
at
hand
;
my
governess
,
who
continued
*NL*
my
fast
friend
,
had
tried
to
obtain
a
pardon
,
but
it
could
not
be
done
*NL*
unless
with
an
expense
too
heavy
for
my
purse
,
considering
that
to
be
*NL*
left
naked
and
empty
,
unless
I
had
resolved
to
return
to
my
old
trade
*NL*
again
,
had
been
worse
than
my
transportation
,
because
there
I
knew
I
*NL*
could
live
,
here
I
could
not
.
The
good
minister
stood
very
hard
on
*NL*
another
account
to
prevent
my
being
transported
also
;
but
he
was
*NL*
answered
,
that
indeed
my
life
had
been
given
me
at
his
first
*NL*
solicitations
,
and
therefore
he
ought
to
ask
no
more
.
He
was
sensibly
*NL*
grieved
at
my
going
,
because
,
as
he
said
,
he
feared
I
should
lose
the
*NL*
good
impressions
which
a
prospect
of
death
had
at
first
made
on
me
,
and
*NL*
which
were
since
increased
by
his
instructions
;
and
the
pious
gentleman
*NL*
was
exceedingly
concerned
about
me
on
that
account
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
other
hand
,
I
really
was
not
so
solicitous
about
it
as
I
was
*NL*
before
,
but
I
industriously
concealed
my
reasons
for
it
from
the
*NL*
minister
,
and
to
the
last
he
did
not
know
but
that
I
went
with
the
*NL*
utmost
reluctance
and
affliction
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
in
the
month
of
February
that
I
was
,
with
seven
other
convicts
,
*NL*
as
they
called
us
,
delivered
to
a
merchant
that
traded
to
Virginia
,
on
*NL*
board
a
ship
,
riding
,
as
they
called
it
,
in
Deptford
Reach
.
The
*NL*
officer
of
the
prison
delivered
us
on
board
,
and
the
master
of
the
*NL*
vessel
gave
a
discharge
for
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
were
for
that
night
clapped
under
hatches
,
and
kept
so
close
that
I
*NL*
thought
I
should
have
been
suffocated
for
want
of
air
;
and
the
next
*NL*
morning
the
ship
weighed
,
and
fell
down
the
river
to
a
place
they
call
*NL*
Bugby
's
Hole
,
which
was
done
,
as
they
told
us
,
by
the
agreement
of
the
*NL*
merchant
,
that
all
opportunity
of
escape
should
be
taken
from
us
.
*NL*
However
,
when
the
ship
came
thither
and
cast
anchor
,
we
were
allowed
*NL*
more
liberty
,
and
particularly
were
permitted
to
come
up
on
the
deck
,
*NL*
but
not
up
on
the
quarter-deck
,
that
being
kept
particularly
for
the
*NL*
captain
and
for
passengers
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
by
the
noise
of
the
men
over
my
head
,
and
the
motion
of
the
ship
,
*NL*
I
perceived
that
they
were
under
sail
,
I
was
at
first
greatly
*NL*
surprised
,
fearing
we
should
go
away
directly
,
and
that
our
friends
*NL*
would
not
be
admitted
to
see
us
any
more
;
but
I
was
easy
soon
after
,
*NL*
when
I
found
they
had
come
to
an
anchor
again
,
and
soon
after
that
we
*NL*
had
notice
given
by
some
of
the
men
where
we
were
,
that
the
next
*NL*
morning
we
should
have
the
liberty
to
come
up
on
deck
,
and
to
have
our
*NL*
friends
come
and
see
us
if
we
had
any
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
that
night
I
lay
upon
the
hard
boards
of
the
deck
,
as
the
*NL*
passengers
did
,
but
we
had
afterwards
the
liberty
of
little
cabins
for
*NL*
such
of
us
as
had
any
bedding
to
lay
in
them
,
and
room
to
stow
any
box
*NL*
or
trunk
for
clothes
and
linen
,
if
we
had
it
-LRB-
which
might
well
be
put
*NL*
in
-RRB-
,
for
some
of
them
had
neither
shirt
nor
shift
or
a
rag
of
linen
or
*NL*
woollen
,
but
what
was
on
their
backs
,
or
a
farthing
of
money
to
help
*NL*
themselves
;
and
yet
I
did
not
find
but
they
fared
well
enough
in
the
*NL*
ship
,
especially
the
women
,
who
got
money
from
the
seamen
for
washing
*NL*
their
clothes
,
sufficient
to
purchase
any
common
things
that
they
*NL*
wanted
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
next
morning
we
had
the
liberty
to
come
up
on
the
deck
,
I
*NL*
asked
one
of
the
officers
of
the
ship
,
whether
I
might
not
have
the
*NL*
liberty
to
send
a
letter
on
shore
,
to
let
my
friends
know
where
the
*NL*
ship
lay
,
and
to
get
some
necessary
things
sent
to
me
.
This
was
,
it
*NL*
seems
,
the
boatswain
,
a
very
civil
,
courteous
sort
of
man
,
who
told
me
*NL*
I
should
have
that
,
or
any
other
liberty
that
I
desired
,
that
he
could
*NL*
allow
me
with
safety
.
I
told
him
I
desired
no
other
;
and
he
answered
*NL*
that
the
ship
's
boat
would
go
up
to
London
the
next
tide
,
and
he
would
*NL*
order
my
letter
to
be
carried
.
*NL*
*NL*
Accordingly
,
when
the
boat
went
off
,
the
boatswain
came
to
me
and
told
*NL*
me
the
boat
was
going
off
,
and
that
he
went
in
it
himself
,
and
asked
me
*NL*
if
my
letter
was
ready
he
would
take
care
of
it
.
I
had
prepared
*NL*
myself
,
you
may
be
sure
,
pen
,
ink
,
and
paper
beforehand
,
and
I
had
*NL*
gotten
a
letter
ready
directed
to
my
governess
,
and
enclosed
another
*NL*
for
my
fellow-prisoner
,
which
,
however
,
I
did
not
let
her
know
was
my
*NL*
husband
,
not
to
the
last
.
In
that
to
my
governess
,
I
let
her
know
*NL*
where
the
ship
lay
,
and
pressed
her
earnestly
to
send
me
what
things
I
*NL*
knew
she
had
got
ready
for
me
for
my
voyage
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
gave
the
boatswain
the
letter
,
I
gave
him
a
shilling
with
it
,
*NL*
which
I
told
him
was
for
the
charge
of
a
messenger
or
porter
,
which
I
*NL*
entreated
him
to
send
with
the
letter
as
soon
as
he
came
on
shore
,
that
*NL*
if
possible
I
might
have
an
answer
brought
back
by
the
same
hand
,
that
*NL*
I
might
know
what
was
become
of
my
things
;
`
for
sir
,
'
says
I
,
`
if
the
*NL*
ship
should
go
away
before
I
have
them
on
board
,
I
am
undone
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
took
care
,
when
I
gave
him
the
shilling
,
to
let
him
see
that
I
had
a
*NL*
little
better
furniture
about
me
than
the
ordinary
prisoners
,
for
he
*NL*
saw
that
I
had
a
purse
,
and
in
it
a
pretty
deal
of
money
;
and
I
found
*NL*
that
the
very
sight
of
it
immediately
furnished
me
with
very
different
*NL*
treatment
from
what
I
should
otherwise
have
met
with
in
the
ship
;
for
*NL*
though
he
was
very
courteous
indeed
before
,
in
a
kind
of
natural
*NL*
compassion
to
me
,
as
a
woman
in
distress
,
yet
he
was
more
than
*NL*
ordinarily
so
afterwards
,
and
procured
me
to
be
better
treated
in
the
*NL*
ship
than
,
I
say
,
I
might
otherwise
have
been
;
as
shall
appear
in
its
*NL*
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
very
honestly
had
my
letter
delivered
to
my
governess
's
own
hands
,
*NL*
and
brought
me
back
an
answer
from
her
in
writing
;
and
when
he
gave
me
*NL*
the
answer
,
gave
me
the
shilling
again
.
`
There
,
'
says
he
,
`
there
's
*NL*
your
shilling
again
too
,
for
I
delivered
the
letter
myself
.
'
I
could
*NL*
not
tell
what
to
say
,
I
was
so
surprised
at
the
thing
;
but
after
some
*NL*
pause
,
I
said
,
`
Sir
,
you
are
too
kind
;
it
had
been
but
reasonable
that
*NL*
you
had
paid
yourself
coach-hire
,
then
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
no
,
'
says
he
,
'
I
am
overpaid
.
What
is
the
gentlewoman
?
Your
*NL*
sister
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
sir
,
'
says
I
,
`
she
is
no
relation
to
me
,
but
she
is
a
dear
friend
,
*NL*
and
all
the
friends
I
have
in
the
world
.
'
`
Well
,
'
says
he
,
`
there
are
*NL*
few
such
friends
in
the
world
.
Why
,
she
cried
after
you
like
a
child
,
'
*NL*
`
Ay
,
'
says
I
again
,
`
she
would
give
a
hundred
pounds
,
I
believe
,
to
*NL*
deliver
me
from
this
dreadful
condition
I
am
in
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Would
she
so
?
'
says
he
.
`
For
half
the
money
I
believe
I
could
put
you
*NL*
in
a
way
how
to
deliver
yourself
.
'
But
this
he
spoke
softly
,
that
*NL*
nobody
could
hear
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Alas
!
sir
,
'
said
I
,
`
but
then
that
must
be
such
a
deliverance
as
,
if
I
*NL*
should
be
taken
again
,
would
cost
me
my
life
.
'
`
Nay
,
'
said
he
,
`
if
you
*NL*
were
once
out
of
the
ship
,
you
must
look
to
yourself
afterwards
;
that
I
*NL*
can
say
nothing
to
.
'
So
we
dropped
the
discourse
for
that
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
,
my
governess
,
faithful
to
the
last
moment
,
conveyed
my
*NL*
letter
to
the
prison
to
my
husband
,
and
got
an
answer
to
it
,
and
the
*NL*
next
day
came
down
herself
to
the
ship
,
bringing
me
,
in
the
first
*NL*
place
,
a
sea-bed
as
they
call
it
,
and
all
its
furniture
,
such
as
was
*NL*
convenient
,
but
not
to
let
the
people
think
it
was
extraordinary
.
She
*NL*
brought
with
her
a
sea-chest
--
that
is
,
a
chest
,
such
as
are
made
for
*NL*
seamen
,
with
all
the
conveniences
in
it
,
and
filled
with
everything
*NL*
almost
that
I
could
want
;
and
in
one
of
the
corners
of
the
chest
,
where
*NL*
there
was
a
private
drawer
,
was
my
bank
of
money
--
this
is
to
say
,
so
*NL*
much
of
it
as
I
had
resolved
to
carry
with
me
;
for
I
ordered
a
part
of
*NL*
my
stock
to
be
left
behind
me
,
to
be
sent
afterwards
in
such
goods
as
I
*NL*
should
want
when
I
came
to
settle
;
for
money
in
that
country
is
not
of
*NL*
much
use
where
all
things
are
brought
for
tobacco
,
much
more
is
it
a
*NL*
great
loss
to
carry
it
from
hence
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
my
case
was
particular
;
it
was
by
no
means
proper
to
me
to
go
*NL*
thither
without
money
or
goods
,
and
for
a
poor
convict
,
that
was
to
be
*NL*
sold
as
soon
as
I
came
on
shore
,
to
carry
with
me
a
cargo
of
goods
*NL*
would
be
to
have
notice
taken
of
it
,
and
perhaps
to
have
them
seized
by
*NL*
the
public
;
so
I
took
part
of
my
stock
with
me
thus
,
and
left
the
other
*NL*
part
with
my
governess
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
governess
brought
me
a
great
many
other
things
,
but
it
was
not
*NL*
proper
for
me
to
look
too
well
provided
in
the
ship
,
at
least
till
I
*NL*
knew
what
kind
of
a
captain
we
should
have
.
When
she
came
into
the
*NL*
ship
,
I
thought
she
would
have
died
indeed
;
her
heart
sank
at
the
sight
*NL*
of
me
,
and
at
the
thoughts
of
parting
with
me
in
that
condition
,
and
*NL*
she
cried
so
intolerably
,
I
could
not
for
a
long
time
have
any
talk
*NL*
with
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
took
that
time
to
read
my
fellow-prisoner
's
letter
,
which
,
however
,
*NL*
greatly
perplexed
me
.
He
told
me
he
was
determined
to
go
,
but
found
it
*NL*
would
be
impossible
for
him
to
be
discharged
time
enough
for
going
in
*NL*
the
same
ship
,
and
which
was
more
than
all
,
he
began
to
question
*NL*
whether
they
would
give
him
leave
to
go
in
what
ship
he
pleased
,
though
*NL*
he
did
voluntarily
transport
himself
;
but
that
they
would
see
him
put
*NL*
on
board
such
a
ship
as
they
should
direct
,
and
that
he
would
be
*NL*
charged
upon
the
captain
as
other
convict
prisoners
were
;
so
that
he
*NL*
began
to
be
in
despair
of
seeing
me
till
he
came
to
Virginia
,
which
*NL*
made
him
almost
desperate
;
seeing
that
,
on
the
other
hand
,
if
I
should
*NL*
not
be
there
,
if
any
accident
of
the
sea
or
of
mortality
should
take
me
*NL*
away
,
he
should
be
the
most
undone
creature
there
in
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
very
perplexing
,
and
I
knew
not
what
course
to
take
.
I
told
*NL*
my
governess
the
story
of
the
boatswain
,
and
she
was
mighty
eager
with
*NL*
me
treat
with
him
;
but
I
had
no
mind
to
it
,
till
I
heard
whether
my
*NL*
husband
,
or
fellow-prisoner
,
so
she
called
him
,
could
be
at
liberty
to
*NL*
go
with
me
or
no
.
At
last
I
was
forced
to
let
her
into
the
whole
*NL*
matter
,
except
only
that
of
his
being
my
husband
.
I
told
her
I
had
*NL*
made
a
positive
bargain
or
agreement
with
him
to
go
,
if
he
could
get
*NL*
the
liberty
of
going
in
the
same
ship
,
and
that
I
found
he
had
money
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
I
read
a
long
lecture
to
her
of
what
I
proposed
to
do
when
we
came
*NL*
there
,
how
we
could
plant
,
settle
,
and
,
in
short
,
grow
rich
without
any
*NL*
more
adventures
;
and
,
as
a
great
secret
,
I
told
her
that
we
were
to
*NL*
marry
as
soon
as
he
came
on
board
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
soon
agreed
cheerfully
to
my
going
when
she
heard
this
,
and
she
*NL*
made
it
her
business
from
that
time
to
get
him
out
of
the
prison
in
*NL*
time
,
so
that
he
might
go
in
the
same
ship
with
me
,
which
at
last
was
*NL*
brought
to
pass
,
though
with
great
difficulty
,
and
not
without
all
the
*NL*
forms
of
a
transported
prisoner-convict
,
which
he
really
was
not
yet
,
*NL*
for
he
had
not
been
tried
,
and
which
was
a
great
mortification
to
him
.
*NL*
As
our
fate
was
now
determined
,
and
we
were
both
on
board
,
actually
*NL*
bound
to
Virginia
,
in
the
despicable
quality
of
transported
convicts
*NL*
destined
to
be
sold
for
slaves
,
I
for
five
years
,
and
he
under
bonds
*NL*
and
security
not
to
return
to
England
any
more
,
as
long
as
he
lived
,
he
*NL*
was
very
much
dejected
and
cast
down
;
the
mortification
of
being
*NL*
brought
on
board
,
as
he
was
,
like
a
prisoner
,
piqued
him
very
much
,
*NL*
since
it
was
first
told
him
he
should
transport
himself
,
and
so
that
he
*NL*
might
go
as
a
gentleman
at
liberty
.
It
is
true
he
was
not
ordered
to
*NL*
be
sold
when
he
came
there
,
as
we
were
,
and
for
that
reason
he
was
*NL*
obliged
to
pay
for
his
passage
to
the
captain
,
which
we
were
not
;
as
to
*NL*
the
rest
,
he
was
as
much
at
a
loss
as
a
child
what
to
do
with
himself
,
*NL*
or
with
what
he
had
,
but
by
directions
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
first
business
was
to
compare
our
stock
.
He
was
very
honest
to
me
,
*NL*
and
told
me
his
stock
was
pretty
good
when
he
came
into
the
prison
,
but
*NL*
the
living
there
as
he
did
in
a
figure
like
a
gentleman
,
and
,
which
was
*NL*
ten
times
as
much
,
the
making
of
friends
,
and
soliciting
his
case
,
had
*NL*
been
very
expensive
;
and
,
in
a
word
,
all
his
stock
that
he
had
left
was
*NL*
#
108
,
which
he
had
about
him
all
in
gold
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
gave
him
an
account
of
my
stock
as
faithfully
,
that
is
to
say
,
of
*NL*
what
I
had
taken
to
carry
with
me
,
for
I
was
resolved
,
whatever
should
*NL*
happen
,
to
keep
what
I
had
left
with
my
governess
in
reserve
;
that
in
*NL*
case
I
should
die
,
what
I
had
with
me
was
enough
to
give
him
,
and
that
*NL*
which
was
left
in
my
governess
's
hands
would
be
her
own
,
which
she
had
*NL*
well
deserved
of
me
indeed
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
stock
which
I
had
with
me
was
#
246
some
odd
shillings
;
so
that
we
*NL*
had
#
354
between
us
,
but
a
worse
gotten
estate
was
scarce
ever
put
*NL*
together
to
being
the
world
with
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
greatest
misfortune
as
to
our
stock
was
that
it
was
all
in
money
,
*NL*
which
every
one
knows
is
an
unprofitable
cargo
to
be
carried
to
the
*NL*
plantations
.
I
believe
his
was
really
all
he
had
left
in
the
world
,
as
*NL*
he
told
me
it
was
;
but
I
,
who
had
between
#
700
and
#
800
in
bank
when
*NL*
this
disaster
befell
me
,
and
who
had
one
of
the
faithfullest
friends
in
*NL*
the
world
to
manage
it
for
me
,
considering
she
was
a
woman
of
manner
of
*NL*
religious
principles
,
had
still
#
300
left
in
her
hand
,
which
I
reserved
*NL*
as
above
;
besides
,
some
very
valuable
things
,
as
particularly
two
gold
*NL*
watches
,
some
small
pieces
of
plate
,
and
some
rings
--
all
stolen
goods
.
*NL*
The
plate
,
rings
,
and
watches
were
put
in
my
chest
with
the
money
,
and
*NL*
with
this
fortune
,
and
in
the
sixty-first
year
of
my
age
,
I
launched
*NL*
out
into
a
new
world
,
as
I
may
call
it
,
in
the
condition
-LRB-
as
to
what
*NL*
appeared
-RRB-
only
of
a
poor
,
naked
convict
,
ordered
to
be
transported
in
*NL*
respite
from
the
gallows
.
My
clothes
were
poor
and
mean
,
but
not
*NL*
ragged
or
dirty
,
and
none
knew
in
the
whole
ship
that
I
had
anything
of
*NL*
value
about
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
as
I
had
a
great
many
very
good
clothes
and
linen
in
*NL*
abundance
,
which
I
had
ordered
to
be
packed
up
in
two
great
boxes
,
I
*NL*
had
them
shipped
on
board
,
not
as
my
goods
,
but
as
consigned
to
my
real
*NL*
name
in
Virginia
;
and
had
the
bills
of
loading
signed
by
a
captain
in
*NL*
my
pocket
;
and
in
these
boxes
was
my
plate
and
watches
,
and
everything
*NL*
of
value
except
my
money
,
which
I
kept
by
itself
in
a
private
drawer
in
*NL*
my
chest
,
which
could
not
be
found
,
or
opened
,
if
found
,
without
splitting
*NL*
the
chest
to
pieces
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
condition
I
lay
for
three
weeks
in
the
ship
,
not
knowing
*NL*
whether
I
should
have
my
husband
with
me
or
no
,
and
therefore
not
*NL*
resolving
how
or
in
what
manner
to
receive
the
honest
boatswain
's
*NL*
proposal
,
which
indeed
he
thought
a
little
strange
at
first
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
end
of
this
time
,
behold
my
husband
came
on
board
.
He
looked
*NL*
with
a
dejected
,
angry
countenance
,
his
great
heart
was
swelled
with
*NL*
rage
and
disdain
;
to
be
dragged
along
with
three
keepers
of
Newgate
,
*NL*
and
put
on
board
like
a
convict
,
when
he
had
not
so
much
as
been
*NL*
brought
to
a
trial
.
He
made
loud
complaints
of
it
by
his
friends
,
for
*NL*
it
seems
he
had
some
interest
;
but
his
friends
got
some
check
in
their
*NL*
application
,
and
were
told
he
had
had
favour
enough
,
and
that
they
had
*NL*
received
such
an
account
of
him
,
since
the
last
grant
of
his
*NL*
transportation
,
that
he
ought
to
think
himself
very
well
treated
that
*NL*
he
was
not
prosecuted
anew
.
This
answer
quieted
him
at
once
,
for
he
*NL*
knew
too
much
what
might
have
happened
,
and
what
he
had
room
to
expect
;
*NL*
and
now
he
saw
the
goodness
of
the
advice
to
him
,
which
prevailed
with
*NL*
him
to
accept
of
the
offer
of
a
voluntary
transportation
.
And
after
*NL*
this
his
chagrin
at
these
hell-hounds
,
as
he
called
them
,
was
a
little
*NL*
over
,
he
looked
a
little
composed
,
began
to
be
cheerful
,
and
as
I
was
*NL*
telling
him
how
glad
I
was
to
have
him
once
more
out
of
their
hands
,
he
*NL*
took
me
in
his
arms
,
and
acknowledged
with
great
tenderness
that
I
had
*NL*
given
him
the
best
advice
possible
.
`
My
dear
,
'
says
he
,
`
thou
has
*NL*
twice
saved
my
life
;
from
henceforward
it
shall
be
all
employed
for
*NL*
you
,
and
I
'll
always
take
your
advice
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
ship
began
now
to
fill
;
several
passengers
came
on
board
,
who
were
*NL*
embarked
on
no
criminal
account
,
and
these
had
accommodations
assigned
*NL*
them
in
the
great
cabin
,
and
other
parts
of
the
ship
,
whereas
we
,
as
*NL*
convicts
,
were
thrust
down
below
,
I
know
not
where
.
But
when
my
*NL*
husband
came
on
board
,
I
spoke
to
the
boatswain
,
who
had
so
early
given
*NL*
me
hints
of
his
friendship
in
carrying
my
letter
.
I
told
him
he
had
*NL*
befriended
me
in
many
things
,
and
I
had
not
made
any
suitable
return
to
*NL*
him
,
and
with
that
I
put
a
guinea
into
his
hand
.
I
told
him
that
my
*NL*
husband
was
now
come
on
board
;
that
though
we
were
both
under
the
*NL*
present
misfortune
,
yet
we
had
been
persons
of
a
different
character
*NL*
from
the
wretched
crew
that
we
came
with
,
and
desired
to
know
of
him
,
*NL*
whether
the
captain
might
not
be
moved
to
admit
us
to
some
conveniences
*NL*
in
the
ship
,
for
which
we
would
make
him
what
satisfaction
he
pleased
,
*NL*
and
that
we
would
gratify
him
for
his
pains
in
procuring
this
for
us
.
*NL*
He
took
the
guinea
,
as
I
could
see
,
with
great
satisfaction
,
and
*NL*
assured
me
of
his
assistance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
told
us
he
did
not
doubt
but
that
the
captain
,
who
was
one
of
*NL*
the
best-humoured
gentlemen
in
the
world
,
would
be
easily
brought
to
*NL*
accommodate
us
as
well
as
we
could
desire
,
and
,
to
make
me
easy
,
told
*NL*
me
he
would
go
up
the
next
tide
on
purpose
to
speak
to
the
captain
*NL*
about
it
.
The
next
morning
,
happening
to
sleep
a
little
longer
than
*NL*
ordinary
,
when
I
got
up
,
and
began
to
look
abroad
,
I
saw
the
boatswain
*NL*
among
the
men
in
his
ordinary
business
.
I
was
a
little
melancholy
at
*NL*
seeing
him
there
,
and
going
forward
to
speak
to
him
,
he
saw
me
,
and
*NL*
came
towards
me
,
but
not
giving
him
time
to
speak
first
,
I
said
,
*NL*
smiling
,
'
I
doubt
,
sir
,
you
have
forgot
us
,
for
I
see
you
are
very
*NL*
busy
.
'
He
returned
presently
,
`
Come
along
with
me
,
and
you
shall
see
.
'
*NL*
So
he
took
me
into
the
great
cabin
,
and
there
sat
a
good
sort
of
a
*NL*
gentlemanly
man
for
a
seaman
,
writing
,
and
with
a
great
many
papers
*NL*
before
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Here
,
'
says
the
boatswain
to
him
that
was
a-writing
,
`
is
the
*NL*
gentlewoman
that
the
captain
spoke
to
you
of
'
;
and
turning
to
me
,
he
*NL*
said
,
'
I
have
been
so
far
from
forgetting
your
business
,
that
I
have
*NL*
been
up
at
the
captain
's
house
,
and
have
represented
faithfully
to
the
*NL*
captain
what
you
said
,
relating
to
you
being
furnished
with
better
*NL*
conveniences
for
yourself
and
your
husband
;
and
the
captain
has
sent
*NL*
this
gentleman
,
who
is
mate
of
the
ship
,
down
with
me
,
on
purpose
to
*NL*
show
you
everything
,
and
to
accommodate
you
fully
to
your
content
,
and
*NL*
bid
me
assure
you
that
you
shall
not
be
treated
like
what
you
were
at
*NL*
first
expected
to
be
,
but
with
the
same
respect
as
other
passengers
are
*NL*
treated
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
mate
then
spoke
to
me
,
and
,
not
giving
me
time
to
thank
the
*NL*
boatswain
for
his
kindness
,
confirmed
what
the
boatswain
had
said
,
and
*NL*
added
that
it
was
the
captain
's
delight
to
show
himself
kind
and
*NL*
charitable
,
especially
to
those
that
were
under
any
misfortunes
,
and
*NL*
with
that
he
showed
me
several
cabins
built
up
,
some
in
the
great
*NL*
cabin
,
and
some
partitioned
off
,
out
of
the
steerage
,
but
opening
into
*NL*
the
great
cabin
on
purpose
for
the
accommodation
of
passengers
,
and
*NL*
gave
me
leave
to
choose
where
I
would
.
However
,
I
chose
a
cabin
which
*NL*
opened
into
the
steerage
,
in
which
was
very
good
conveniences
to
set
*NL*
our
chest
and
boxes
,
and
a
table
to
eat
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
mate
then
told
me
that
the
boatswain
had
given
so
good
a
character
*NL*
of
me
and
my
husband
,
as
to
our
civil
behaviour
,
that
he
had
orders
to
*NL*
tell
me
we
should
eat
with
him
,
if
we
thought
fit
,
during
the
whole
*NL*
voyage
,
on
the
common
terms
of
passengers
;
that
we
might
lay
in
some
*NL*
fresh
provisions
,
if
we
pleased
;
or
if
not
,
he
should
lay
in
his
usual
*NL*
store
,
and
we
should
have
share
with
him
.
This
was
very
reviving
news
*NL*
to
me
,
after
so
many
hardships
and
afflictions
as
I
had
gone
through
of
*NL*
late
.
I
thanked
him
,
and
told
him
the
captain
should
make
his
own
*NL*
terms
with
us
,
and
asked
him
leave
to
go
and
tell
my
husband
of
it
,
who
*NL*
was
not
very
well
,
and
was
not
yet
out
of
his
cabin
.
Accordingly
I
*NL*
went
,
and
my
husband
,
whose
spirits
were
still
so
much
sunk
with
the
*NL*
indignity
-LRB-
as
he
understood
it
-RRB-
offered
him
,
that
he
was
scared
yet
*NL*
himself
,
was
so
revived
with
the
account
that
I
gave
him
of
the
*NL*
reception
we
were
like
to
have
in
the
ship
,
that
he
was
quite
another
*NL*
man
,
and
new
vigour
and
courage
appeared
in
his
very
countenance
.
So
*NL*
true
is
it
,
that
the
greatest
of
spirits
,
when
overwhelmed
by
their
*NL*
afflictions
,
are
subject
to
the
greatest
dejections
,
and
are
the
most
*NL*
apt
to
despair
and
give
themselves
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
some
little
pause
to
recover
himself
,
my
husband
came
up
with
me
,
*NL*
and
gave
the
mate
thanks
for
the
kindness
,
which
he
had
expressed
to
*NL*
us
,
and
sent
suitable
acknowledgment
by
him
to
the
captain
,
offering
to
*NL*
pay
him
by
advance
,
whatever
he
demanded
for
our
passage
,
and
for
the
*NL*
conveniences
he
had
helped
us
to
.
The
mate
told
him
that
the
captain
*NL*
would
be
on
board
in
the
afternoon
,
and
that
he
would
leave
all
that
*NL*
till
he
came
.
Accordingly
,
in
the
afternoon
the
captain
came
,
and
we
*NL*
found
him
the
same
courteous
,
obliging
man
that
the
boatswain
had
*NL*
represented
him
to
be
;
and
he
was
so
well
pleased
with
my
husband
's
*NL*
conversation
,
that
,
in
short
,
he
would
not
let
us
keep
the
cabin
we
had
*NL*
chosen
,
but
gave
us
one
that
,
as
I
said
before
,
opened
into
the
great
*NL*
cabin
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nor
were
his
conditions
exorbitant
,
or
the
man
craving
and
eager
to
*NL*
make
a
prey
of
us
,
but
for
fifteen
guineas
we
had
our
whole
passage
and
*NL*
provisions
and
cabin
,
ate
at
the
captain
's
table
,
and
were
very
*NL*
handsomely
entertained
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
captain
lay
himself
in
the
other
part
of
the
great
cabin
,
having
*NL*
let
his
round
house
,
as
they
call
it
,
to
a
rich
planter
who
went
over
*NL*
with
his
wife
and
three
children
,
who
ate
by
themselves
.
He
had
some
*NL*
other
ordinary
passengers
,
who
quartered
in
the
steerage
,
and
as
for
*NL*
our
old
fraternity
,
they
were
kept
under
the
hatches
while
the
ship
lay
*NL*
there
,
and
came
very
little
on
the
deck
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
not
refrain
acquainting
my
governess
with
what
had
happened
;
it
*NL*
was
but
just
that
she
,
who
was
so
really
concerned
for
me
,
should
have
*NL*
part
in
my
good
fortune
.
Besides
,
I
wanted
her
assistance
to
supply
me
*NL*
with
several
necessaries
,
which
before
I
was
shy
of
letting
anybody
see
*NL*
me
have
,
that
it
might
not
be
public
;
but
now
I
had
a
cabin
and
room
to
*NL*
set
things
in
,
I
ordered
abundance
of
good
things
for
our
comfort
in
*NL*
the
voyage
,
as
brandy
,
sugar
,
lemons
,
etc.
,
to
make
punch
,
and
treat
*NL*
our
benefactor
,
the
captain
;
and
abundance
of
things
for
eating
and
*NL*
drinking
in
the
voyage
;
also
a
larger
bed
,
and
bedding
proportioned
to
*NL*
it
;
so
that
,
in
a
word
,
we
resolved
to
want
for
nothing
in
the
voyage
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
while
I
had
provided
nothing
for
our
assistance
when
we
should
*NL*
come
to
the
place
and
begin
to
call
ourselves
planters
;
and
I
was
far
*NL*
from
being
ignorant
of
what
was
needful
on
that
occasion
;
particularly
*NL*
all
sorts
of
tools
for
the
planter
's
work
,
and
for
building
;
and
all
*NL*
kinds
of
furniture
for
our
dwelling
,
which
,
if
to
be
bought
in
the
*NL*
country
,
must
necessarily
cost
double
the
price
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
I
discoursed
that
point
with
my
governess
,
and
she
went
and
waited
*NL*
upon
the
captain
,
and
told
him
that
she
hoped
ways
might
be
found
out
*NL*
for
her
two
unfortunate
cousins
,
as
she
called
us
,
to
obtain
our
*NL*
freedom
when
we
came
into
the
country
,
and
so
entered
into
a
discourse
*NL*
with
him
about
the
means
and
terms
also
,
of
which
I
shall
say
more
in
*NL*
its
place
;
and
after
thus
sounding
the
captain
,
she
let
him
know
,
*NL*
though
we
were
unhappy
in
the
circumstances
that
occasioned
our
going
,
*NL*
yet
that
we
were
not
unfurnished
to
set
ourselves
to
work
in
the
*NL*
country
,
and
we
resolved
to
settle
and
live
there
as
planters
,
if
we
*NL*
might
be
put
in
a
way
how
to
do
it
.
The
captain
readily
offered
his
*NL*
assistance
,
told
her
the
method
of
entering
upon
such
business
,
and
how
*NL*
easy
,
nay
,
how
certain
it
was
for
industrious
people
to
recover
their
*NL*
fortunes
in
such
a
manner
.
`
Madam
,
'
says
he
,
''
tis
no
reproach
to
any
*NL*
many
in
that
country
to
have
been
sent
over
in
worse
circumstances
than
*NL*
I
perceive
your
cousins
are
in
,
provided
they
do
but
apply
with
*NL*
diligence
and
good
judgment
to
the
business
of
that
place
when
they
*NL*
come
there
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
then
inquired
of
him
what
things
it
was
necessary
we
should
carry
*NL*
over
with
us
,
and
he
,
like
a
very
honest
as
well
as
knowing
man
,
told
*NL*
her
thus
:
`
Madam
,
your
cousins
in
the
first
place
must
procure
*NL*
somebody
to
buy
them
as
servants
,
in
conformity
to
the
conditions
of
*NL*
their
transportation
,
and
then
,
in
the
name
of
that
person
,
they
may
go
*NL*
about
what
they
will
;
they
may
either
purchase
some
plantations
already
*NL*
begun
,
or
they
may
purchase
land
of
the
Government
of
the
country
,
and
*NL*
begin
where
they
please
,
and
both
will
be
done
reasonably
.
'
She
bespoke
*NL*
his
favour
in
the
first
article
,
which
he
promised
to
her
to
take
upon
*NL*
himself
,
and
indeed
faithfully
performed
it
,
and
as
to
the
rest
,
he
*NL*
promised
to
recommend
us
to
such
as
should
give
us
the
best
advice
,
and
*NL*
not
to
impose
upon
us
,
which
was
as
much
as
could
be
desired
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
then
asked
him
if
it
would
not
be
necessary
to
furnish
us
with
a
*NL*
stock
of
tools
and
materials
for
the
business
of
planting
,
and
he
said
,
*NL*
`
Yes
,
by
all
means
.
'
And
then
she
begged
his
assistance
in
it
.
She
*NL*
told
him
she
would
furnish
us
with
everything
that
was
convenient
*NL*
whatever
it
cost
her
.
He
accordingly
gave
her
a
long
particular
of
*NL*
things
necessary
for
a
planter
,
which
,
by
his
account
,
came
to
about
*NL*
fourscore
or
a
hundred
pounds
.
And
,
in
short
,
she
went
about
as
*NL*
dexterously
to
buy
them
,
as
if
she
had
been
an
old
Virginia
merchant
;
*NL*
only
that
she
bought
,
by
my
direction
,
above
twice
as
much
of
*NL*
everything
as
he
had
given
her
a
list
of
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
she
put
on
board
in
her
own
name
,
took
his
bills
of
loading
for
*NL*
them
,
and
endorsed
those
bills
of
loading
to
my
husband
,
insuring
the
*NL*
cargo
afterwards
in
her
own
name
,
by
our
order
;
so
that
we
were
*NL*
provided
for
all
events
,
and
for
all
disasters
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
should
have
told
you
that
my
husband
gave
her
all
his
whole
stock
of
*NL*
#
108
,
which
,
as
I
have
said
,
he
had
about
him
in
gold
,
to
lay
out
thus
,
*NL*
and
I
gave
her
a
good
sum
besides
;
so
that
I
did
not
break
into
the
*NL*
stock
which
I
had
left
in
her
hands
at
all
,
but
after
we
had
sorted
out
*NL*
our
whole
cargo
,
we
had
yet
near
#
200
in
money
,
which
was
more
than
*NL*
enough
for
our
purpose
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
condition
,
very
cheerful
,
and
indeed
joyful
at
being
so
happily
*NL*
accommodated
as
we
were
,
we
set
sail
from
Bugby
's
Hole
to
Gravesend
,
*NL*
where
the
ship
lay
about
ten
more
days
,
and
where
the
captain
came
on
*NL*
board
for
good
and
all
.
Here
the
captain
offered
us
a
civility
,
which
*NL*
indeed
we
had
no
reason
to
expect
,
namely
,
to
let
us
go
on
shore
and
*NL*
refresh
ourselves
,
upon
giving
our
words
in
a
solemn
manner
that
we
*NL*
would
not
go
from
him
,
and
that
we
would
return
peaceably
on
board
*NL*
again
.
This
was
such
an
evidence
of
his
confidence
in
us
,
that
it
*NL*
overcame
my
husband
,
who
,
in
a
mere
principle
of
gratitude
,
told
him
,
*NL*
as
he
could
not
be
in
any
capacity
to
make
a
suitable
return
for
such
a
*NL*
favour
,
so
he
could
not
think
of
accepting
of
it
,
nor
could
he
be
easy
*NL*
that
the
captain
should
run
such
a
risk
.
After
some
mutual
civilities
,
*NL*
I
gave
my
husband
a
purse
,
in
which
was
eighty
guineas
,
and
he
put
in
*NL*
into
the
captain
's
hand
.
`
There
,
captain
,
'
says
he
,
`
there
's
part
of
a
*NL*
pledge
for
our
fidelity
;
if
we
deal
dishonestly
with
you
on
any
*NL*
account
,
't
is
your
own
.
'
And
on
this
we
went
on
shore
.
*NL*
*NL*
Indeed
,
the
captain
had
assurance
enough
of
our
resolutions
to
go
,
for
*NL*
that
having
made
such
provision
to
settle
there
,
it
did
not
seem
*NL*
rational
that
we
would
choose
to
remain
here
at
the
expense
and
peril
*NL*
of
life
,
for
such
it
must
have
been
if
we
had
been
taken
again
.
In
a
*NL*
word
,
we
went
all
on
shore
with
the
captain
,
and
supped
together
in
*NL*
Gravesend
,
where
we
were
very
merry
,
stayed
all
night
,
lay
at
the
house
*NL*
where
we
supped
,
and
came
all
very
honestly
on
board
again
with
him
in
*NL*
the
morning
.
Here
we
bought
ten
dozen
bottles
of
good
beer
,
some
wine
,
*NL*
some
fowls
,
and
such
things
as
we
thought
might
be
acceptable
on
board
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
governess
was
with
us
all
this
while
,
and
went
with
us
round
into
*NL*
the
Downs
,
as
did
also
the
captain
's
wife
,
with
whom
she
went
back
.
I
*NL*
was
never
so
sorrowful
at
parting
with
my
own
mother
as
I
was
at
*NL*
parting
with
her
,
and
I
never
saw
her
more
.
We
had
a
fair
easterly
*NL*
wind
sprung
up
the
third
day
after
we
came
to
the
Downs
,
and
we
sailed
*NL*
from
thence
the
10th
of
April
.
Nor
did
we
touch
any
more
at
any
place
,
*NL*
till
,
being
driven
on
the
coast
of
Ireland
by
a
very
hard
gale
of
wind
,
*NL*
the
ship
came
to
an
anchor
in
a
little
bay
,
near
the
mouth
of
a
river
,
*NL*
whose
name
I
remember
not
,
but
they
said
the
river
came
down
from
*NL*
Limerick
,
and
that
it
was
the
largest
river
in
Ireland
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
,
being
detained
by
bad
weather
for
some
time
,
the
captain
,
who
*NL*
continued
the
same
kind
,
good-humoured
man
as
at
first
,
took
us
two
on
*NL*
shore
with
him
again
.
He
did
it
now
in
kindness
to
my
husband
indeed
,
*NL*
who
bore
the
sea
very
ill
,
and
was
very
sick
,
especially
when
it
blew
*NL*
so
hard
.
Here
we
bought
in
again
a
store
of
fresh
provisions
,
*NL*
especially
beef
,
pork
,
mutton
,
and
fowls
,
and
the
captain
stayed
to
*NL*
pickle
up
five
or
six
barrels
of
beef
to
lengthen
out
the
ship
's
store
.
*NL*
We
were
here
not
above
five
days
,
when
the
weather
turning
mild
,
and
a
*NL*
fair
wind
,
we
set
sail
again
,
and
in
two-and-forty
days
came
safe
to
*NL*
the
coast
of
Virginia
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
drew
near
to
the
shore
,
the
captain
called
me
to
him
,
and
told
*NL*
me
that
he
found
by
my
discourse
I
had
some
relations
in
the
place
,
and
*NL*
that
I
had
been
there
before
,
and
so
he
supposed
I
understood
the
*NL*
custom
in
their
disposing
the
convict
prisoners
when
they
arrived
.
I
*NL*
told
him
I
did
not
,
and
that
as
to
what
relations
I
had
in
the
place
,
*NL*
he
might
be
sure
I
would
make
myself
known
to
none
of
them
while
I
was
*NL*
in
the
circumstances
of
a
prisoner
,
and
that
as
to
the
rest
,
we
left
*NL*
ourselves
entirely
to
him
to
assist
us
,
as
he
was
pleased
to
promise
us
*NL*
he
would
do
.
He
told
me
I
must
get
somebody
in
the
place
to
come
and
*NL*
buy
us
as
servants
,
and
who
must
answer
for
us
to
the
governor
of
the
*NL*
country
,
if
he
demanded
us
.
I
told
him
we
should
do
as
he
should
*NL*
direct
;
so
he
brought
a
planter
to
treat
with
him
,
as
it
were
,
for
the
*NL*
purchase
of
these
two
servants
,
my
husband
and
me
,
and
there
we
were
*NL*
formally
sold
to
him
,
and
went
ashore
with
him
.
The
captain
went
with
*NL*
us
,
and
carried
us
to
a
certain
house
,
whether
it
was
to
be
called
a
*NL*
tavern
or
not
I
know
not
,
but
we
had
a
bowl
of
punch
there
made
of
rum
,
*NL*
etc.
,
and
were
very
merry
.
After
some
time
the
planter
gave
us
a
*NL*
certificate
of
discharge
,
and
an
acknowledgment
of
having
served
him
*NL*
faithfully
,
and
we
were
free
from
him
the
next
morning
,
to
go
wither
we
*NL*
would
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
this
piece
of
service
the
captain
demanded
of
us
six
thousand
*NL*
weight
of
tabacco
,
which
he
said
he
was
accountable
for
to
his
*NL*
freighter
,
and
which
we
immediately
bought
for
him
,
and
made
him
a
*NL*
present
of
twenty
guineas
besides
,
with
which
he
was
abundantly
*NL*
satisfied
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
not
proper
to
enter
here
into
the
particulars
of
what
part
of
the
*NL*
colony
of
Virginia
we
settled
in
,
for
divers
reasons
;
it
may
suffice
to
*NL*
mention
that
we
went
into
the
great
river
Potomac
,
the
ship
being
bound
*NL*
thither
;
and
there
we
intended
to
have
settled
first
,
though
afterwards
*NL*
we
altered
our
minds
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
thing
I
did
of
moment
after
having
gotten
all
our
goods
on
*NL*
shore
,
and
placed
them
in
a
storehouse
,
or
warehouse
,
which
,
with
a
*NL*
lodging
,
we
hired
at
the
small
place
or
village
where
we
landed
--
I
say
,
*NL*
the
first
thing
was
to
inquire
after
my
mother
,
and
after
my
brother
*NL*
-LRB-
that
fatal
person
whom
I
married
as
a
husband
,
as
I
have
related
at
*NL*
large
-RRB-
.
A
little
inquiry
furnished
me
with
information
that
Mrs.
--
,
*NL*
that
is
,
my
mother
,
was
dead
;
that
my
brother
-LRB-
or
husband
-RRB-
was
alive
,
*NL*
which
I
confess
I
was
not
very
glad
to
hear
;
but
which
was
worse
,
I
*NL*
found
he
was
removed
from
the
plantation
where
he
lived
formerly
,
and
*NL*
where
I
lived
with
him
,
and
lived
with
one
of
his
sons
in
a
plantation
*NL*
just
by
the
place
where
we
landed
,
and
where
we
had
hired
a
warehouse
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
a
little
surprised
at
first
,
but
as
I
ventured
to
satisfy
myself
*NL*
that
he
could
not
know
me
,
I
was
not
only
perfectly
easy
,
but
had
a
*NL*
great
mind
to
see
him
,
if
it
was
possible
to
so
do
without
his
seeing
*NL*
me
.
In
order
to
that
I
found
out
by
inquiry
the
plantation
where
he
*NL*
lived
,
and
with
a
woman
of
that
place
whom
I
got
to
help
me
,
like
what
*NL*
we
call
a
chairwoman
,
I
rambled
about
towards
the
place
as
if
I
had
*NL*
only
a
mind
to
see
the
country
and
look
about
me
.
At
last
I
came
so
*NL*
near
that
I
saw
the
dwellinghouse
.
I
asked
the
woman
whose
plantation
*NL*
that
was
;
she
said
it
belonged
to
such
a
man
,
and
looking
out
a
little
*NL*
to
our
right
hands
,
`
there
,
'
says
she
,
is
the
gentleman
that
owns
the
*NL*
plantation
,
and
his
father
with
him
.
'
`
What
are
their
Christian
*NL*
names
?
'
said
I.
'
I
know
not
,
'
says
she
,
`
what
the
old
gentleman
's
name
*NL*
is
,
but
the
son
's
name
is
Humphrey
;
and
I
believe
,
'
says
she
,
`
the
*NL*
father
's
is
so
too
.
'
You
may
guess
,
if
you
can
,
what
a
confused
*NL*
mixture
of
joy
and
fight
possessed
my
thoughts
upon
this
occasion
,
for
*NL*
I
immediately
knew
that
this
was
nobody
else
but
my
own
son
,
by
that
*NL*
father
she
showed
me
,
who
was
my
own
brother
.
I
had
no
mask
,
but
I
*NL*
ruffled
my
hood
so
about
my
face
,
that
I
depended
upon
it
that
after
*NL*
above
twenty
years
'
absence
,
and
withal
not
expecting
anything
of
me
in
*NL*
that
part
of
the
world
,
he
would
not
be
able
to
know
anything
of
me
.
*NL*
But
I
need
not
have
used
all
that
caution
,
for
the
old
gentleman
was
*NL*
grown
dim-sighted
by
some
distemper
which
had
fallen
upon
his
eyes
,
and
*NL*
could
but
just
see
well
enough
to
walk
about
,
and
not
run
against
a
*NL*
tree
or
into
a
ditch
.
The
woman
that
was
with
me
had
told
me
that
by
a
*NL*
mere
accident
,
knowing
nothing
of
what
importance
it
was
to
me
.
As
*NL*
they
drew
near
to
us
,
I
said
,
`
Does
he
know
you
,
Mrs.
Owen
?
'
-LRB-
so
they
*NL*
called
the
woman
-RRB-
.
`
Yes
,
'
said
she
,
`
if
he
hears
me
speak
,
he
will
*NL*
know
me
;
but
he
ca
n't
see
well
enough
to
know
me
or
anybody
else
'
;
and
*NL*
so
she
told
me
the
story
of
his
sight
,
as
I
have
related
.
This
made
me
*NL*
secure
,
and
so
I
threw
open
my
hoods
again
,
and
let
them
pass
by
me
.
*NL*
It
was
a
wretched
thing
for
a
mother
thus
to
see
her
own
son
,
a
*NL*
handsome
,
comely
young
gentleman
in
flourishing
circumstances
,
and
*NL*
durst
not
make
herself
known
to
him
,
and
durst
not
take
any
notice
of
*NL*
him
.
Let
any
mother
of
children
that
reads
this
consider
it
,
and
but
*NL*
think
with
what
anguish
of
mind
I
restrained
myself
;
what
yearnings
of
*NL*
soul
I
had
in
me
to
embrace
him
,
and
weep
over
him
;
and
how
I
thought
*NL*
all
my
entrails
turned
within
me
,
that
my
very
bowels
moved
,
and
I
knew
*NL*
not
what
to
do
,
as
I
now
know
not
how
to
express
those
agonies
!
When
*NL*
he
went
from
me
I
stood
gazing
and
trembling
,
and
looking
after
him
as
*NL*
long
as
I
could
see
him
;
then
sitting
down
to
rest
me
,
but
turned
from
*NL*
her
,
and
lying
on
my
face
,
wept
,
and
kissed
the
ground
that
he
had
set
*NL*
his
foot
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
not
conceal
my
disorder
so
much
from
the
woman
but
that
she
*NL*
perceived
it
,
and
thought
I
was
not
well
,
which
I
was
obliged
to
*NL*
pretend
was
true
;
upon
which
she
pressed
me
to
rise
,
the
ground
being
*NL*
damp
and
dangerous
,
which
I
did
accordingly
,
and
walked
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
was
going
back
again
,
and
still
talking
of
this
gentleman
and
his
*NL*
son
,
a
new
occasion
of
melancholy
offered
itself
thus
.
The
woman
*NL*
began
,
as
if
she
would
tell
me
a
story
to
divert
me
:
`
There
goes
,
'
says
*NL*
she
,
'
a
very
odd
tale
among
the
neighbours
where
this
gentleman
*NL*
formerly
live
.
'
`
What
was
that
?
'
said
I.
`
Why
,
'
says
she
,
`
that
old
*NL*
gentleman
going
to
England
,
when
he
was
a
young
man
,
fell
in
love
with
*NL*
a
young
lady
there
,
one
of
the
finest
women
that
ever
was
seen
,
and
*NL*
married
her
,
and
brought
her
over
hither
to
his
mother
who
was
then
*NL*
living
.
He
lived
here
several
years
with
her
,
'
continued
she
,
`
and
had
*NL*
several
children
by
her
,
of
which
the
young
gentleman
that
was
with
him
*NL*
now
was
one
;
but
after
some
time
,
the
old
gentlewoman
,
his
mother
,
*NL*
talking
to
her
of
something
relating
to
herself
when
she
was
in
*NL*
England
,
and
of
her
circumstances
in
England
,
which
were
bad
enough
,
*NL*
the
daughter-in-law
began
to
be
very
much
surprised
and
uneasy
;
and
,
in
*NL*
short
,
examining
further
into
things
,
it
appeared
past
all
*NL*
contradiction
that
the
old
gentlewoman
was
her
own
mother
,
and
that
*NL*
consequently
that
son
was
his
wife
's
own
brother
,
which
struck
the
*NL*
whole
family
with
horror
,
and
put
them
into
such
confusion
that
it
had
*NL*
almost
ruined
them
all
.
The
young
woman
would
not
live
with
him
;
the
*NL*
son
,
her
brother
and
husband
,
for
a
time
went
distracted
;
and
at
last
*NL*
the
young
woman
went
away
for
England
,
and
has
never
been
heard
of
*NL*
since
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
easy
to
believe
that
I
was
strangely
affected
with
this
story
,
*NL*
but
't
is
impossible
to
describe
the
nature
of
my
disturbance
.
I
seemed
*NL*
astonished
at
the
story
,
and
asked
her
a
thousand
questions
about
the
*NL*
particulars
,
which
I
found
she
was
thoroughly
acquainted
with
.
At
last
*NL*
I
began
to
inquire
into
the
circumstances
of
the
family
,
how
the
old
*NL*
gentlewoman
,
I
mean
my
mother
,
died
,
and
how
she
left
what
she
had
;
for
*NL*
my
mother
had
promised
me
very
solemnly
,
that
when
she
died
she
would
*NL*
do
something
for
me
,
and
leave
it
so
,
as
that
,
if
I
was
living
,
I
*NL*
should
one
way
or
other
come
at
it
,
without
its
being
in
the
power
of
*NL*
her
son
,
my
brother
and
husband
,
to
prevent
it
.
She
told
me
she
did
*NL*
not
know
exactly
how
it
was
ordered
,
but
she
had
been
told
that
my
*NL*
mother
had
left
a
sum
of
money
,
and
had
tied
her
plantation
for
the
*NL*
payment
of
it
,
to
be
made
good
to
the
daughter
,
if
ever
she
could
be
*NL*
heard
of
,
either
in
England
or
elsewhere
;
and
that
the
trust
was
left
*NL*
with
this
son
,
who
was
the
person
that
we
saw
with
his
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
news
too
good
for
me
to
make
light
of
,
and
,
you
may
be
sure
,
*NL*
filled
my
heart
with
a
thousand
thoughts
,
what
course
I
should
take
,
*NL*
how
,
and
when
,
and
in
what
manner
I
should
make
myself
known
,
or
*NL*
whether
I
should
ever
make
myself
know
or
no
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
was
a
perplexity
that
I
had
not
indeed
skill
to
manage
myself
in
,
*NL*
neither
knew
I
what
course
to
take
.
It
lay
heavy
upon
my
mind
night
*NL*
and
day
.
I
could
neither
sleep
nor
converse
,
so
that
my
husband
*NL*
perceived
it
,
and
wondered
what
ailed
me
,
strove
to
divert
me
,
but
it
*NL*
was
all
to
no
purpose
.
He
pressed
me
to
tell
him
what
it
was
troubled
*NL*
me
,
but
I
put
it
off
,
till
at
last
,
importuning
me
continually
,
I
was
*NL*
forced
to
form
a
story
,
which
yet
had
a
plain
truth
to
lay
it
upon
too
.
*NL*
I
told
him
I
was
troubled
because
I
found
we
must
shift
our
quarters
*NL*
and
alter
our
scheme
of
settling
,
for
that
I
found
I
should
be
known
if
*NL*
I
stayed
in
that
part
of
the
country
;
for
that
my
mother
being
dead
,
*NL*
several
of
my
relations
were
come
into
that
part
where
we
then
was
,
and
*NL*
that
I
must
either
discover
myself
to
them
,
which
in
our
present
*NL*
circumstances
was
not
proper
on
many
accounts
,
or
remove
;
and
which
to
*NL*
do
I
knew
not
,
and
that
this
it
was
that
made
me
so
melancholy
and
so
*NL*
thoughtful
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
joined
with
me
in
this
,
that
it
was
by
no
means
proper
for
me
to
*NL*
make
myself
known
to
anybody
in
the
circumstances
in
which
we
then
*NL*
were
;
and
therefore
he
told
me
he
would
be
willing
to
remove
to
any
*NL*
other
part
of
the
country
,
or
even
to
any
other
country
if
I
thought
*NL*
fit
.
But
now
I
had
another
difficulty
,
which
was
,
that
if
I
removed
to
*NL*
any
other
colony
,
I
put
myself
out
of
the
way
of
ever
making
a
due
*NL*
search
after
those
effects
which
my
mother
had
left
.
Again
I
could
*NL*
never
so
much
as
think
of
breaking
the
secret
of
my
former
marriage
to
*NL*
my
new
husband
;
it
was
not
a
story
,
as
I
thought
,
that
would
bear
*NL*
telling
,
nor
could
I
tell
what
might
be
the
consequences
of
it
;
and
it
*NL*
was
impossible
to
search
into
the
bottom
of
the
thing
without
making
it
*NL*
public
all
over
the
country
,
as
well
who
I
was
,
as
what
I
now
was
also
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
perplexity
I
continued
a
great
while
,
and
this
made
my
spouse
*NL*
very
uneasy
;
for
he
found
me
perplexed
,
and
yet
thought
I
was
not
open
*NL*
with
him
,
and
did
not
let
him
into
every
part
of
my
grievance
;
and
he
*NL*
would
often
say
,
he
wondered
what
he
had
done
that
I
would
not
trust
*NL*
him
with
whatever
it
was
,
especially
if
it
was
grievous
and
afflicting
.
*NL*
The
truth
is
,
he
ought
to
have
been
trusted
with
everything
,
for
no
man
*NL*
in
the
world
could
deserve
better
of
a
wife
;
but
this
was
a
thing
I
*NL*
knew
not
how
to
open
to
him
,
and
yet
having
nobody
to
disclose
any
part
*NL*
of
it
to
,
the
burthen
was
too
heavy
for
my
mind
;
for
let
them
say
what
*NL*
they
please
of
our
sex
not
being
able
to
keep
a
secret
,
my
life
is
a
*NL*
plain
conviction
to
me
of
the
contrary
;
but
be
it
our
sex
,
or
the
man
's
*NL*
sex
,
a
secret
of
moment
should
always
have
a
confidant
,
a
bosom
friend
,
*NL*
to
whom
we
may
communicate
the
joy
of
it
,
or
the
grief
of
it
,
be
it
*NL*
which
it
will
,
or
it
will
be
a
double
weight
upon
the
spirits
,
and
*NL*
perhaps
become
even
insupportable
in
itself
;
and
this
I
appeal
to
all
*NL*
human
testimony
for
the
truth
of
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
this
is
the
cause
why
many
times
men
as
well
as
women
,
and
men
of
*NL*
the
greatest
and
best
qualities
other
ways
,
yet
have
found
themselves
*NL*
weak
in
this
part
,
and
have
not
been
able
to
bear
the
weight
of
a
*NL*
secret
joy
or
of
a
secret
sorrow
,
but
have
been
obliged
to
disclose
it
,
*NL*
even
for
the
mere
giving
vent
to
themselves
,
and
to
unbend
the
mind
*NL*
oppressed
with
the
load
and
weights
which
attended
it
.
Nor
was
this
*NL*
any
token
of
folly
or
thoughtlessness
at
all
,
but
a
natural
consequence
*NL*
of
the
thing
;
and
such
people
,
had
they
struggled
longer
with
the
*NL*
oppression
,
would
certainly
have
told
it
in
their
sleep
,
and
disclosed
*NL*
the
secret
,
let
it
have
been
of
what
fatal
nature
soever
,
without
*NL*
regard
to
the
person
to
whom
it
might
be
exposed
.
This
necessity
of
*NL*
nature
is
a
thing
which
works
sometimes
with
such
vehemence
in
the
*NL*
minds
of
those
who
are
guilty
of
any
atrocious
villainy
,
such
as
secret
*NL*
murder
in
particular
,
that
they
have
been
obliged
to
discover
it
,
*NL*
though
the
consequence
would
necessarily
be
their
own
destruction
.
*NL*
Now
,
though
it
may
be
true
that
the
divine
justice
ought
to
have
the
*NL*
glory
of
all
those
discoveries
and
confessions
,
yet
't
is
as
certain
*NL*
that
Providence
,
which
ordinarily
works
by
the
hands
of
nature
,
makes
*NL*
use
here
of
the
same
natural
causes
to
produce
those
extraordinary
*NL*
effects
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
give
several
remarkable
instances
of
this
in
my
long
*NL*
conversation
with
crime
and
with
criminals
.
I
knew
one
fellow
that
,
*NL*
while
I
was
in
prison
in
Newgate
,
was
one
of
those
they
called
then
*NL*
night-fliers
.
I
know
not
what
other
word
they
may
have
understood
it
*NL*
by
since
,
but
he
was
one
who
by
connivance
was
admitted
to
go
abroad
*NL*
every
evening
,
when
he
played
his
pranks
,
and
furnished
those
honest
*NL*
people
they
call
thief-catchers
with
business
to
find
out
the
next
day
,
*NL*
and
restore
for
a
reward
what
they
had
stolen
the
evening
before
.
This
*NL*
fellow
was
as
sure
to
tell
in
his
sleep
all
that
he
had
done
,
and
every
*NL*
step
he
had
taken
,
what
he
had
stolen
,
and
where
,
as
sure
as
if
he
had
*NL*
engaged
to
tell
it
waking
,
and
that
there
was
no
harm
or
danger
in
it
,
*NL*
and
therefore
he
was
obliged
,
after
he
had
been
out
,
to
lock
himself
*NL*
up
,
or
be
locked
up
by
some
of
the
keepers
that
had
him
in
fee
,
that
*NL*
nobody
should
hear
him
;
but
,
on
the
other
hand
,
if
he
had
told
all
the
*NL*
particulars
,
and
given
a
full
account
of
his
rambles
and
success
,
to
*NL*
any
comrade
,
any
brother
thief
,
or
to
his
employers
,
as
I
may
justly
*NL*
call
them
,
then
all
was
well
with
him
,
and
he
slept
as
quietly
as
other
*NL*
people
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
publishing
this
account
of
my
life
is
for
the
sake
of
the
just
*NL*
moral
of
very
part
of
it
,
and
for
instruction
,
caution
,
warning
,
and
*NL*
improvement
to
every
reader
,
so
this
will
not
pass
,
I
hope
,
for
an
*NL*
unnecessary
digression
concerning
some
people
being
obliged
to
disclose
*NL*
the
greatest
secrets
either
of
their
own
or
other
people
's
affairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Under
the
certain
oppression
of
this
weight
upon
my
mind
,
I
laboured
in
*NL*
the
case
I
have
been
naming
;
and
the
only
relief
I
found
for
it
was
to
*NL*
let
my
husband
into
so
much
of
it
as
I
thought
would
convince
him
of
*NL*
the
necessity
there
was
for
us
to
think
of
settling
in
some
other
part
*NL*
of
the
world
;
and
the
next
consideration
before
us
was
,
which
part
of
*NL*
the
English
settlements
we
should
go
to
.
My
husband
was
a
perfect
*NL*
stranger
to
the
country
,
and
had
not
yet
so
much
as
a
geographical
*NL*
knowledge
of
the
situation
of
the
several
places
;
and
I
,
that
,
till
I
*NL*
wrote
this
,
did
not
know
what
the
word
geographical
signified
,
had
only
*NL*
a
general
knowledge
from
long
conversation
with
people
that
came
from
*NL*
or
went
to
several
places
;
but
this
I
knew
,
that
Maryland
,
*NL*
Pennsylvania
,
East
and
West
Jersey
,
New
York
,
and
New
England
lay
all
*NL*
north
of
Virginia
,
and
that
they
were
consequently
all
colder
climates
,
*NL*
to
which
for
that
very
reason
,
I
had
an
aversion
.
For
that
as
I
*NL*
naturally
loved
warm
weather
,
so
now
I
grew
into
years
I
had
a
stronger
*NL*
inclination
to
shun
a
cold
climate
.
I
therefore
considered
of
going
to
*NL*
Caroline
,
which
is
the
only
southern
colony
of
the
English
on
the
*NL*
continent
of
America
,
and
hither
I
proposed
to
go
;
and
the
rather
*NL*
because
I
might
with
great
ease
come
from
thence
at
any
time
,
when
it
*NL*
might
be
proper
to
inquire
after
my
mother
's
effects
,
and
to
make
*NL*
myself
known
enough
to
demand
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
this
resolution
I
proposed
to
my
husband
our
going
away
from
where
*NL*
we
was
,
and
carrying
all
our
effects
with
us
to
Caroline
,
where
we
*NL*
resolved
to
settle
;
for
my
husband
readily
agreed
to
the
first
part
,
*NL*
viz
.
that
was
not
at
all
proper
to
stay
where
we
was
,
since
I
had
*NL*
assured
him
we
should
be
known
there
,
and
the
rest
I
effectually
*NL*
concealed
from
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
now
I
found
a
new
difficulty
upon
me
.
The
main
affair
grew
heavy
*NL*
upon
my
mind
still
,
and
I
could
not
think
of
going
out
of
the
country
*NL*
without
somehow
or
other
making
inquiry
into
the
grand
affair
of
what
*NL*
my
mother
had
done
for
me
;
nor
could
I
with
any
patience
bear
the
*NL*
thought
of
going
away
,
and
not
make
myself
known
to
my
old
husband
*NL*
-LRB-
brother
-RRB-
,
or
to
my
child
,
his
son
;
only
I
would
fain
have
had
this
*NL*
done
without
my
new
husband
having
any
knowledge
of
it
,
or
they
having
*NL*
any
knowledge
of
him
,
or
that
I
had
such
a
thing
as
a
husband
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
cast
about
innumerable
ways
in
my
thoughts
how
this
might
be
done
.
I
*NL*
would
gladly
have
sent
my
husband
away
to
Caroline
with
all
our
goods
,
*NL*
and
have
come
after
myself
,
but
this
was
impracticable
;
he
would
never
*NL*
stir
without
me
,
being
himself
perfectly
unacquainted
with
the
country
,
*NL*
and
with
the
methods
of
settling
there
or
anywhere
else
.
Then
I
*NL*
thought
we
would
both
go
first
with
part
of
our
goods
,
and
that
when
we
*NL*
were
settled
I
should
come
back
to
Virginia
and
fetch
the
remainder
;
*NL*
but
even
then
I
knew
he
would
never
part
with
me
,
and
be
left
there
to
*NL*
go
on
alone
.
The
case
was
plain
;
he
was
bred
a
gentleman
,
and
by
*NL*
consequence
was
not
only
unacquainted
,
but
indolent
,
and
when
we
did
*NL*
settle
,
would
much
rather
go
out
into
the
woods
with
his
gun
,
which
*NL*
they
call
there
hunting
,
and
which
is
the
ordinary
work
of
the
Indians
,
*NL*
and
which
they
do
as
servants
;
I
say
,
he
would
rather
do
that
than
*NL*
attend
the
natural
business
of
his
plantation
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
were
therefore
difficulties
insurmountable
,
and
such
as
I
knew
*NL*
not
what
to
do
in
.
I
had
such
strong
impressions
on
my
mind
about
*NL*
discovering
myself
to
my
brother
,
formerly
my
husband
,
that
I
could
not
*NL*
withstand
them
;
and
the
rather
,
because
it
ran
constantly
in
my
*NL*
thoughts
,
that
if
I
did
not
do
it
while
he
lived
,
I
might
in
vain
*NL*
endeavour
to
convince
my
son
afterward
that
I
was
really
the
same
*NL*
person
,
and
that
I
was
his
mother
,
and
so
might
both
lose
the
*NL*
assistance
and
comfort
of
the
relation
,
and
the
benefit
of
whatever
it
*NL*
was
my
mother
had
left
me
;
and
yet
,
on
the
other
hand
,
I
could
never
*NL*
think
it
proper
to
discover
myself
to
them
in
the
circumstances
I
was
*NL*
in
,
as
well
relating
to
the
having
a
husband
with
me
as
to
my
being
*NL*
brought
over
by
a
legal
transportation
as
a
criminal
;
on
both
which
*NL*
accounts
it
was
absolutely
necessary
to
me
to
remove
from
the
place
*NL*
where
I
was
,
and
come
again
to
him
,
as
from
another
place
and
in
*NL*
another
figure
.
*NL*
*NL*
Upon
those
considerations
,
I
went
on
with
telling
my
husband
the
*NL*
absolute
necessity
there
was
of
our
not
settling
in
Potomac
River
,
at
*NL*
least
that
we
should
be
presently
made
public
there
;
whereas
if
we
went
*NL*
to
any
other
place
in
the
world
,
we
should
come
in
with
as
much
*NL*
reputation
as
any
family
that
came
to
plant
;
that
,
as
it
was
always
*NL*
agreeable
to
the
inhabitants
to
have
families
come
among
them
to
plant
,
*NL*
who
brought
substance
with
them
,
either
to
purchase
plantations
or
*NL*
begin
new
ones
,
so
we
should
be
sure
of
a
kind
,
agreeable
reception
,
*NL*
and
that
without
any
possibility
of
a
discovery
of
our
circumstances
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
told
him
in
general
,
too
,
that
as
I
had
several
relations
in
the
*NL*
place
where
we
were
,
and
that
I
durst
not
now
let
myself
be
known
to
*NL*
them
,
because
they
would
soon
come
into
a
knowledge
of
the
occasion
and
*NL*
reason
of
my
coming
over
,
which
would
be
to
expose
myself
to
the
last
*NL*
degree
,
so
I
had
reason
to
believe
that
my
mother
,
who
died
here
,
had
*NL*
left
me
something
,
and
perhaps
considerable
,
which
it
might
be
very
*NL*
well
worth
my
while
to
inquire
after
;
but
that
this
too
could
not
be
*NL*
done
without
exposing
us
publicly
,
unless
we
went
from
hence
;
and
then
,
*NL*
wherever
we
settled
,
I
might
come
,
as
it
were
,
to
visit
and
to
see
my
*NL*
brother
and
nephews
,
make
myself
known
to
them
,
claim
and
inquire
after
*NL*
what
was
my
due
,
be
received
with
respect
,
and
at
the
same
time
have
*NL*
justice
done
me
with
cheerfulness
and
good
will
;
whereas
,
if
I
did
it
*NL*
now
,
I
could
expect
nothing
but
with
trouble
,
such
as
exacting
it
by
*NL*
force
,
receiving
it
with
curses
and
reluctance
,
and
with
all
kinds
of
*NL*
affronts
,
which
he
would
not
perhaps
bear
to
see
;
that
in
case
of
being
*NL*
obliged
to
legal
proofs
of
being
really
her
daughter
,
I
might
be
at
*NL*
loss
,
be
obliged
to
have
recourse
to
England
,
and
it
may
be
to
fail
at
*NL*
last
,
and
so
lose
it
,
whatever
it
might
be
.
With
these
arguments
,
and
*NL*
having
thus
acquainted
my
husband
with
the
whole
secret
so
far
as
was
*NL*
needful
of
him
,
we
resolved
to
go
and
seek
a
settlement
in
some
other
*NL*
colony
,
and
at
first
thoughts
,
Caroline
was
the
place
we
pitched
upon
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
order
to
this
we
began
to
make
inquiry
for
vessels
going
to
*NL*
Carolina
,
and
in
a
very
little
while
got
information
,
that
on
the
other
*NL*
side
the
bay
,
as
they
call
it
,
namely
,
in
Maryland
,
there
was
a
ship
*NL*
which
came
from
Carolina
,
laden
with
rice
and
other
goods
,
and
was
*NL*
going
back
again
thither
,
and
from
thence
to
Jamaica
,
with
provisions
.
*NL*
On
this
news
we
hired
a
sloop
to
take
in
our
goods
,
and
taking
,
as
it
*NL*
were
,
a
final
farewell
of
Potomac
River
,
we
went
with
all
our
cargo
*NL*
over
to
Maryland
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
a
long
and
unpleasant
voyage
,
and
my
spouse
said
it
was
worse
*NL*
to
him
than
all
the
voyage
from
England
,
because
the
weather
was
but
*NL*
indifferent
,
the
water
rough
,
and
the
vessel
small
and
inconvenient
.
*NL*
In
the
next
place
,
we
were
full
a
hundred
miles
up
Potomac
River
,
in
a
*NL*
part
which
they
call
Westmoreland
County
,
and
as
that
river
is
by
far
*NL*
the
greatest
in
Virginia
,
and
I
have
heard
say
it
is
the
greatest
river
*NL*
in
the
world
that
falls
into
another
river
,
and
not
directly
into
the
*NL*
sea
,
so
we
had
base
weather
in
it
,
and
were
frequently
in
great
danger
;
*NL*
for
though
we
were
in
the
middle
,
we
could
not
see
land
on
either
side
*NL*
for
many
leagues
together
.
Then
we
had
the
great
river
or
bay
of
*NL*
Chesapeake
to
cross
,
which
is
where
the
river
Potomac
falls
into
it
,
*NL*
near
thirty
miles
broad
,
and
we
entered
more
great
vast
waters
whose
*NL*
names
I
know
not
,
so
that
our
voyage
was
full
two
hundred
miles
,
in
a
*NL*
poor
,
sorry
sloop
,
with
all
our
treasure
,
and
if
any
accident
had
*NL*
happened
to
us
,
we
might
at
last
have
been
very
miserable
;
supposing
we
*NL*
had
lost
our
goods
and
saved
our
lives
only
,
and
had
then
been
left
*NL*
naked
and
destitute
,
and
in
a
wild
,
strange
place
not
having
one
friend
*NL*
or
acquaintance
in
all
that
part
of
the
world
.
The
very
thought
of
it
*NL*
gives
me
some
horror
,
even
since
the
danger
is
past
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
we
came
to
the
place
in
five
days
'
sailing
;
I
think
they
call
it
*NL*
Philip
's
Point
;
and
behold
,
when
we
came
thither
,
the
ship
bound
to
*NL*
Carolina
was
loaded
and
gone
away
but
three
days
before
.
This
was
a
*NL*
disappointment
;
but
,
however
,
I
,
that
was
to
be
discouraged
with
*NL*
nothing
,
told
my
husband
that
since
we
could
not
get
passage
to
*NL*
Caroline
,
and
that
the
country
we
was
in
was
very
fertile
and
good
,
we
*NL*
would
,
if
he
liked
of
it
,
see
if
we
could
find
out
anything
for
our
*NL*
tune
where
we
was
,
and
that
if
he
liked
things
we
would
settle
here
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
immediately
went
on
shore
,
but
found
no
conveniences
just
at
that
*NL*
place
,
either
for
our
being
on
shore
or
preserving
our
goods
on
shore
,
*NL*
but
was
directed
by
a
very
honest
Quaker
,
whom
we
found
there
,
to
go
to
*NL*
a
place
about
sixty
miles
east
;
that
is
to
say
,
nearer
the
mouth
of
the
*NL*
bay
,
where
he
said
he
lived
,
and
where
we
should
be
accommodated
,
*NL*
either
to
plant
,
or
to
wait
for
any
other
place
to
plant
in
that
might
*NL*
be
more
convenient
;
and
he
invited
us
with
so
much
kindness
and
simple
*NL*
honesty
,
that
we
agreed
to
go
,
and
the
Quaker
himself
went
with
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
we
bought
us
two
servants
,
viz
.
an
English
woman-servant
just
come
*NL*
on
shore
from
a
ship
of
Liverpool
,
and
a
Negro
man-servant
,
things
*NL*
absolutely
necessary
for
all
people
that
pretended
to
settle
in
that
*NL*
country
.
This
honest
Quaker
was
very
helpful
to
us
,
and
when
we
came
*NL*
to
the
place
that
he
proposed
to
us
,
found
us
out
a
convenient
*NL*
storehouse
for
our
goods
,
and
lodging
for
ourselves
and
our
servants
;
*NL*
and
about
two
months
or
thereabouts
afterwards
,
by
his
direction
,
we
*NL*
took
up
a
large
piece
of
land
from
the
governor
of
that
country
,
in
*NL*
order
to
form
our
plantation
,
and
so
we
laid
the
thoughts
of
going
to
*NL*
Caroline
wholly
aside
,
having
been
very
well
received
here
,
and
*NL*
accommodated
with
a
convenient
lodging
till
we
could
prepare
things
,
*NL*
and
have
land
enough
cleared
,
and
timber
and
materials
provided
for
*NL*
building
us
a
house
,
all
which
we
managed
by
the
direction
of
the
*NL*
Quaker
;
so
that
in
one
year
's
time
we
had
nearly
fifty
acres
of
land
*NL*
cleared
,
part
of
it
enclosed
,
and
some
of
it
planted
with
tabacco
,
*NL*
though
not
much
;
besides
,
we
had
garden
ground
and
corn
sufficient
to
*NL*
help
supply
our
servants
with
roots
and
herbs
and
bread
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
I
persuaded
my
husband
to
let
me
go
over
the
bay
again
,
and
*NL*
inquire
after
my
friends
.
He
was
the
willinger
to
consent
to
it
now
,
*NL*
because
he
had
business
upon
his
hands
sufficient
to
employ
him
,
*NL*
besides
his
gun
to
divert
him
,
which
they
call
hunting
there
,
and
which
*NL*
he
greatly
delighted
in
;
and
indeed
we
used
to
look
at
one
another
,
*NL*
sometimes
with
a
great
deal
of
pleasure
,
reflecting
how
much
better
*NL*
that
was
,
not
than
Newgate
only
,
but
than
the
most
prosperous
of
our
*NL*
circumstances
in
the
wicked
trade
that
we
had
been
both
carrying
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
affair
was
in
a
very
good
posture
;
we
purchased
of
the
proprietors
*NL*
of
the
colony
as
much
land
for
#
35
,
paid
in
ready
money
,
as
would
make
*NL*
a
sufficient
plantation
to
employ
between
fifty
and
sixty
servants
,
and
*NL*
which
,
being
well
improved
,
would
be
sufficient
to
us
as
long
as
we
*NL*
could
either
of
us
live
;
and
as
for
children
,
I
was
past
the
prospect
*NL*
of
anything
of
that
kind
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
out
good
fortune
did
not
end
here
.
I
went
,
as
I
have
said
,
over
*NL*
the
bay
,
to
the
place
where
my
brother
,
once
a
husband
,
lived
;
but
I
*NL*
did
not
go
to
the
same
village
where
I
was
before
,
but
went
up
another
*NL*
great
river
,
on
the
east
side
of
the
river
Potomac
,
called
Rappahannock
*NL*
River
,
and
by
this
means
came
on
the
back
of
his
plantation
,
which
was
*NL*
large
,
and
by
the
help
of
a
navigable
creek
,
or
little
river
,
that
ran
*NL*
into
the
Rappahannock
,
I
came
very
near
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
now
fully
resolved
to
go
up
point-blank
to
my
brother
-LRB-
husband
-RRB-
,
*NL*
and
to
tell
him
who
I
was
;
but
not
knowing
what
temper
I
might
find
him
*NL*
in
,
or
how
much
out
of
temper
rather
,
I
might
make
him
by
such
a
rash
*NL*
visit
,
I
resolved
to
write
a
letter
to
him
first
,
to
let
him
know
who
I
*NL*
was
,
and
that
I
was
come
not
to
give
him
any
trouble
upon
the
old
*NL*
relation
,
which
I
hoped
was
entirely
forgot
,
but
that
I
applied
to
him
*NL*
as
a
sister
to
a
brother
,
desiring
his
assistance
in
the
case
of
that
*NL*
provision
which
our
mother
,
at
her
decease
,
had
left
for
my
support
,
*NL*
and
which
I
did
not
doubt
but
he
would
do
me
justice
in
,
especially
*NL*
considering
that
I
was
come
thus
far
to
look
after
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
said
some
very
tender
,
kind
things
in
the
letter
about
his
son
,
which
*NL*
I
told
him
he
knew
to
be
my
own
child
,
and
that
as
I
was
guilty
of
*NL*
nothing
in
marrying
him
,
any
more
than
he
was
in
marrying
me
,
neither
*NL*
of
us
having
then
known
our
being
at
all
related
to
one
another
,
so
I
*NL*
hoped
he
would
allow
me
the
most
passionate
desire
of
once
seeing
my
*NL*
one
and
only
child
,
and
of
showing
something
of
the
infirmities
of
a
*NL*
mother
in
preserving
a
violent
affect
for
him
,
who
had
never
been
able
*NL*
to
retain
any
thought
of
me
one
way
or
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
did
believe
that
,
having
received
this
letter
,
he
would
immediately
*NL*
give
it
to
his
son
to
read
,
I
having
understood
his
eyes
being
so
dim
,
*NL*
that
he
could
not
see
to
read
it
;
but
it
fell
out
better
than
so
,
for
*NL*
as
his
sight
was
dim
,
so
he
had
allowed
his
son
to
open
all
letters
*NL*
that
came
to
his
hand
for
him
,
and
the
old
gentleman
being
from
home
,
*NL*
or
out
of
the
way
when
my
messenger
came
,
my
letter
came
directly
to
my
*NL*
son
's
hand
,
and
he
opened
and
read
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
called
the
messenger
in
,
after
some
little
stay
,
and
asked
him
where
*NL*
the
person
was
who
gave
him
the
letter
.
The
messenger
told
him
the
*NL*
place
,
which
was
about
seven
miles
off
,
so
he
bid
him
stay
,
and
*NL*
ordering
a
horse
to
be
got
ready
,
and
two
servants
,
away
he
came
to
me
*NL*
with
the
messenger
.
Let
any
one
judge
the
consternation
I
was
in
when
*NL*
my
messenger
came
back
,
and
told
me
the
old
gentleman
was
not
at
home
,
*NL*
but
his
son
was
come
along
with
him
,
and
was
just
coming
up
to
me
.
I
*NL*
was
perfectly
confounded
,
for
I
knew
not
whether
it
was
peace
or
war
,
*NL*
nor
could
I
tell
how
to
behave
;
however
,
I
had
but
a
very
few
moments
*NL*
to
think
,
for
my
son
was
at
the
heels
of
the
messenger
,
and
coming
up
*NL*
into
my
lodgings
,
asked
the
fellow
at
the
door
something
.
I
suppose
it
*NL*
was
,
for
I
did
not
hear
it
so
as
to
understand
it
,
which
was
the
*NL*
gentlewoman
that
sent
him
;
for
the
messenger
said
,
`
There
she
is
,
sir
'
;
*NL*
at
which
he
comes
directly
up
to
me
,
kisses
me
,
took
me
in
his
arms
,
*NL*
and
embraced
me
with
so
much
passion
that
he
could
not
speak
,
but
I
*NL*
could
feel
his
breast
heave
and
throb
like
a
child
,
that
cries
,
but
*NL*
sobs
,
and
can
not
cry
it
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
can
neither
express
nor
describe
the
joy
that
touched
my
very
soul
*NL*
when
I
found
,
for
it
was
easy
to
discover
that
part
,
that
he
came
not
*NL*
as
a
stranger
,
but
as
a
son
to
a
mother
,
and
indeed
as
a
son
who
had
*NL*
never
before
known
what
a
mother
of
his
own
was
;
in
short
,
we
cried
*NL*
over
one
another
a
considerable
while
,
when
at
last
he
broke
out
first
.
*NL*
`
My
dear
mother
,
'
says
he
,
`
are
you
still
alive
?
I
never
expected
to
*NL*
have
seen
your
face
.
'
As
for
me
,
I
could
say
nothing
a
great
while
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
we
had
both
recovered
ourselves
a
little
,
and
were
able
to
talk
,
*NL*
he
told
me
how
things
stood
.
As
to
what
I
had
written
to
his
father
,
he
*NL*
told
me
he
had
not
showed
my
letter
to
his
father
,
or
told
him
anything
*NL*
about
it
;
that
what
his
grandmother
left
me
was
in
his
hands
,
and
that
*NL*
he
would
do
me
justice
to
my
full
satisfaction
;
that
as
to
his
father
,
*NL*
he
was
old
and
infirm
both
in
body
and
mind
;
that
he
was
very
fretful
*NL*
and
passionate
,
almost
blind
,
and
capable
of
nothing
;
and
he
questioned
*NL*
whether
he
would
know
how
to
act
in
an
affair
which
was
of
so
nice
a
*NL*
nature
as
this
;
and
that
therefore
he
had
come
himself
,
as
well
to
*NL*
satisfy
himself
in
seeing
me
,
which
he
could
not
restrain
himself
from
,
*NL*
as
also
to
put
it
into
my
power
to
make
a
judgment
,
after
I
had
seen
*NL*
how
things
were
,
whether
I
would
discover
myself
to
his
father
or
no
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
really
so
prudently
and
wisely
managed
,
that
I
found
my
son
*NL*
was
a
man
of
sense
,
and
needed
no
direction
from
me
.
I
told
him
I
did
*NL*
not
wonder
that
his
father
was
as
he
had
described
him
,
for
that
his
*NL*
head
was
a
little
touched
before
I
went
away
;
and
principally
his
*NL*
disturbance
was
because
I
could
not
be
persuaded
to
conceal
our
*NL*
relation
and
to
live
with
him
as
my
husband
,
after
I
knew
that
he
was
*NL*
my
brother
;
that
as
he
knew
better
than
I
what
his
father
's
present
*NL*
condition
was
,
I
should
readily
join
with
him
in
such
measure
as
he
*NL*
would
direct
;
that
I
was
indifferent
as
to
seeing
his
father
,
since
I
*NL*
had
seen
him
first
,
and
he
could
not
have
told
me
better
news
than
to
*NL*
tell
me
that
what
his
grandmother
had
left
me
was
entrusted
in
his
*NL*
hands
,
who
,
I
doubted
not
,
now
he
knew
who
I
was
,
would
,
as
he
said
,
do
*NL*
me
justice
.
I
inquired
then
how
long
my
mother
had
been
dead
,
and
*NL*
where
she
died
,
and
told
so
many
particulars
of
the
family
,
that
I
left
*NL*
him
no
room
to
doubt
the
truth
of
my
being
really
and
truly
his
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
son
then
inquired
where
I
was
,
and
how
I
had
disposed
myself
.
I
*NL*
told
him
I
was
on
the
Maryland
side
of
the
bay
,
at
the
plantation
of
a
*NL*
particular
friend
who
came
from
England
in
the
same
ship
with
me
;
that
*NL*
as
for
that
side
of
the
bay
where
he
was
,
I
had
no
habitation
.
He
told
*NL*
me
I
should
go
home
with
him
,
and
live
with
him
,
if
I
pleased
,
as
long
*NL*
as
I
lived
;
that
as
to
his
father
,
he
knew
nobody
,
and
would
never
so
*NL*
much
as
guess
at
me
.
I
considered
of
that
a
little
,
and
told
him
,
that
*NL*
though
it
was
really
no
concern
to
me
to
live
at
a
distance
from
him
,
*NL*
yet
I
could
not
say
it
would
be
the
most
comfortable
thing
in
the
world
*NL*
to
me
to
live
in
the
house
with
him
,
and
to
have
that
unhappy
object
*NL*
always
before
me
,
which
had
been
such
a
blow
to
my
peace
before
;
that
*NL*
though
I
should
be
glad
to
have
his
company
-LRB-
my
son
-RRB-
,
or
to
be
as
near
*NL*
him
as
possible
while
I
stayed
,
yet
I
could
not
think
of
being
in
the
*NL*
house
where
I
should
be
also
under
constant
restraint
for
fear
of
*NL*
betraying
myself
in
my
discourse
,
nor
should
I
be
able
to
refrain
some
*NL*
expressions
in
my
conversing
with
him
as
my
son
,
that
might
discover
*NL*
the
whole
affair
,
which
would
by
no
means
be
convenient
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
acknowledged
that
I
was
right
in
all
this
.
`
But
then
,
dear
mother
,
'
*NL*
says
he
,
`
you
shall
be
as
near
me
as
you
can
.
'
So
he
took
me
with
him
*NL*
on
horseback
to
a
plantation
next
to
his
own
,
and
where
I
was
as
well
*NL*
entertained
as
I
could
have
been
in
his
own
.
Having
left
me
there
he
*NL*
went
away
home
,
telling
me
we
would
talk
of
the
main
business
the
next
*NL*
day
;
and
having
first
called
me
his
aunt
,
and
given
a
charge
to
the
*NL*
people
,
who
it
seems
were
his
tenants
,
to
treat
me
with
all
possible
*NL*
respect
.
About
two
hours
after
he
was
gone
,
he
sent
me
a
maid-servant
*NL*
and
a
Negro
boy
to
wait
on
me
,
and
provisions
ready
dressed
for
my
*NL*
supper
;
and
thus
I
was
as
if
I
had
been
in
a
new
world
,
and
began
*NL*
secretly
now
to
wish
that
I
had
not
brought
my
Lancashire
husband
from
*NL*
England
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
that
wish
was
not
hearty
neither
,
for
I
loved
my
Lancashire
*NL*
husband
entirely
,
as
indeed
I
had
ever
done
from
the
beginning
;
and
he
*NL*
merited
from
me
as
much
as
it
was
possible
for
a
man
to
do
;
but
that
by
*NL*
the
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
morning
my
son
came
to
visit
me
again
almost
as
soon
as
I
was
*NL*
up
.
After
a
little
discourse
,
he
first
of
all
pulled
out
a
deerskin
*NL*
bag
,
and
gave
it
me
,
with
five-and-fifty
Spanish
pistoles
in
it
,
and
*NL*
told
me
that
was
to
supply
my
expenses
from
England
,
for
though
it
was
*NL*
not
his
business
to
inquire
,
yet
he
ought
to
think
I
did
not
bring
a
*NL*
great
deal
of
money
out
with
me
,
it
not
being
usual
to
bring
much
money
*NL*
into
that
country
.
Then
he
pulled
out
his
grandmother
's
will
,
and
read
*NL*
it
over
to
me
,
whereby
it
appeared
that
she
had
left
a
small
*NL*
plantation
,
as
he
called
it
,
on
York
River
,
that
is
,
where
my
mother
*NL*
lived
,
to
me
,
with
the
stock
of
servants
and
cattle
upon
it
,
and
given
*NL*
it
in
trust
to
this
son
of
mine
for
my
use
,
whenever
he
should
hear
of
*NL*
my
being
alive
,
and
to
my
heirs
,
if
I
had
any
children
,
and
in
default
*NL*
of
heirs
,
to
whomsoever
I
should
by
will
dispose
of
it
;
but
gave
the
*NL*
income
of
it
,
till
I
should
be
heard
of
,
or
found
,
to
my
said
son
;
and
*NL*
if
I
should
not
be
living
,
then
it
was
to
him
,
and
his
heirs
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
plantation
,
though
remote
from
him
,
he
said
he
did
not
let
out
,
*NL*
but
managed
it
by
a
head-clerk
-LRB-
steward
-RRB-
,
as
he
did
another
that
was
*NL*
his
father
's
,
that
lay
hard
by
it
,
and
went
over
himself
three
or
four
*NL*
times
a
year
to
look
after
it
.
I
asked
him
what
he
thought
the
*NL*
plantation
might
be
worth
.
He
said
,
if
I
would
let
it
out
,
he
would
*NL*
give
me
about
#
60
a
year
for
it
;
but
if
I
would
live
on
it
,
then
it
*NL*
would
be
worth
much
more
,
and
,
he
believed
,
would
bring
me
in
about
*NL*
#
150
a
year
.
But
seeing
I
was
likely
either
to
settle
on
the
other
*NL*
side
of
the
bay
,
or
might
perhaps
have
a
mind
to
go
back
to
England
*NL*
again
,
if
I
would
let
him
be
my
steward
he
would
manage
it
for
me
,
as
*NL*
he
had
done
for
himself
,
and
that
he
believed
he
should
be
able
to
send
*NL*
me
as
much
tobacco
to
England
from
it
as
would
yield
me
about
#
100
a
*NL*
year
,
sometimes
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
all
strange
news
to
me
,
and
things
I
had
not
been
used
to
;
and
*NL*
really
my
heart
began
to
look
up
more
seriously
than
I
think
it
ever
*NL*
did
before
,
and
to
look
with
great
thankfulness
to
the
hand
of
*NL*
Providence
,
which
had
done
such
wonders
for
me
,
who
had
been
myself
the
*NL*
greatest
wonder
of
wickedness
perhaps
that
had
been
suffered
to
live
in
*NL*
the
world
.
And
I
must
again
observe
,
that
not
on
this
occasion
only
,
*NL*
but
even
on
all
other
occasions
of
thankfulness
,
my
past
wicked
and
*NL*
abominable
life
never
looked
so
monstrous
to
me
,
and
I
never
so
*NL*
completely
abhorred
it
,
and
reproached
myself
with
it
,
as
when
I
had
a
*NL*
sense
upon
me
of
Providence
doing
good
to
me
,
while
I
had
been
making
*NL*
those
vile
returns
on
my
part
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
leave
the
reader
to
improve
these
thoughts
,
as
no
doubt
they
will
*NL*
see
cause
,
and
I
go
on
to
the
fact
.
My
son
's
tender
carriage
and
kind
*NL*
offers
fetched
tears
from
me
,
almost
all
the
while
he
talked
with
me
.
*NL*
Indeed
,
I
could
scarce
discourse
with
him
but
in
the
intervals
of
my
*NL*
passion
;
however
,
at
length
I
began
,
and
expressing
myself
with
wonder
*NL*
at
my
being
so
happy
to
have
the
trust
of
what
I
had
left
,
put
into
the
*NL*
hands
of
my
own
child
,
I
told
him
,
that
as
to
the
inheritance
of
it
,
I
*NL*
had
no
child
but
him
in
the
world
,
and
was
now
past
having
any
if
I
*NL*
should
marry
,
and
therefore
would
desire
him
to
get
a
writing
drawn
,
*NL*
which
I
was
ready
to
execute
,
by
which
I
would
,
after
me
,
give
it
*NL*
wholly
to
him
and
to
his
heirs
.
And
in
the
meantime
,
smiling
,
I
asked
*NL*
him
what
made
him
continue
a
bachelor
so
long
.
His
answer
was
kind
and
*NL*
ready
,
that
Virginia
did
not
yield
any
great
plenty
of
wives
,
and
that
*NL*
since
I
talked
of
going
back
to
England
,
I
should
send
him
a
wife
from
*NL*
London
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
substance
of
our
first
day
's
conversation
,
the
pleasantest
*NL*
day
that
ever
passed
over
my
head
in
my
life
,
and
which
gave
me
the
*NL*
truest
satisfaction
.
He
came
every
day
after
this
,
and
spent
a
great
*NL*
part
of
his
time
with
me
,
and
carried
me
about
to
several
of
his
*NL*
friends
'
houses
,
where
I
was
entertained
with
great
respect
.
Also
I
*NL*
dined
several
times
at
his
own
house
,
when
he
took
care
always
to
see
*NL*
his
half-dead
father
so
out
of
the
way
that
I
never
saw
him
,
or
he
me
.
*NL*
I
made
him
one
present
,
and
it
was
all
I
had
of
value
,
and
that
was
one
*NL*
of
the
gold
watches
,
of
which
I
mentioned
above
,
that
I
had
two
in
my
*NL*
chest
,
and
this
I
happened
to
have
with
me
,
and
I
gave
it
him
at
his
*NL*
third
visit
.
I
told
him
I
had
nothing
of
any
value
to
bestow
but
that
,
*NL*
and
I
desired
he
would
now
and
then
kiss
it
for
my
sake
.
I
did
not
*NL*
indeed
tell
him
that
I
had
stole
it
from
a
gentlewoman
's
side
,
at
a
*NL*
meeting-house
in
London
.
That
's
by
the
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
stood
a
little
while
hesitating
,
as
if
doubtful
whether
to
take
it
*NL*
or
no
;
but
I
pressed
it
on
him
,
and
made
him
accept
it
,
and
it
was
not
*NL*
much
less
worth
than
his
leather
pouch
full
of
Spanish
gold
;
no
,
though
*NL*
it
were
to
be
reckoned
as
if
at
London
,
whereas
it
was
worth
twice
as
*NL*
much
there
,
where
I
gave
it
him
.
At
length
he
took
it
,
kissed
it
,
told
*NL*
me
the
watch
should
be
a
debt
upon
him
that
he
would
be
paying
as
long
*NL*
as
I
lived
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
days
after
he
brought
the
writings
of
gift
,
and
the
scrivener
*NL*
with
them
,
and
I
signed
them
very
freely
,
and
delivered
them
to
him
*NL*
with
a
hundred
kisses
;
for
sure
nothing
ever
passed
between
a
mother
*NL*
and
a
tender
,
dutiful
child
with
more
affection
.
The
next
day
he
*NL*
brings
me
an
obligation
under
his
hand
and
seal
,
whereby
he
engaged
*NL*
himself
to
manage
and
improve
the
plantation
for
my
account
,
and
with
*NL*
his
utmost
skill
,
and
to
remit
the
produce
to
my
order
wherever
I
*NL*
should
be
;
and
withal
,
to
be
obliged
himself
to
make
up
the
produce
*NL*
#
100
a
year
to
me
.
When
he
had
done
so
,
he
told
me
that
as
I
came
to
*NL*
demand
it
before
the
crop
was
off
,
I
had
a
right
to
produce
of
the
*NL*
current
year
,
and
so
he
paid
me
#
100
in
Spanish
pieces
of
eight
,
and
*NL*
desired
me
to
give
him
a
receipt
for
it
as
in
full
for
that
year
,
*NL*
ending
at
Christmas
following
;
this
being
about
the
latter
end
of
*NL*
August
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
stayed
here
about
five
weeks
,
and
indeed
had
much
ado
to
get
away
*NL*
then
.
Nay
,
he
would
have
come
over
the
bay
with
me
,
but
I
would
by
no
*NL*
means
allow
him
to
it
.
However
,
he
would
send
me
over
in
a
sloop
of
*NL*
his
own
,
which
was
built
like
a
yacht
,
and
served
him
as
well
for
*NL*
pleasure
as
business
.
This
I
accepted
of
,
and
so
,
after
the
utmost
*NL*
expressions
both
of
duty
and
affection
,
he
let
me
come
away
,
and
I
*NL*
arrived
safe
in
two
days
at
my
friend
's
the
Quaker
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
brought
over
with
me
for
the
use
of
our
plantation
,
three
horses
,
*NL*
with
harness
and
saddles
,
some
hogs
,
two
cows
,
and
a
thousand
other
*NL*
things
,
the
gift
of
the
kindest
and
tenderest
child
that
ever
woman
*NL*
had
.
I
related
to
my
husband
all
the
particulars
of
this
voyage
,
*NL*
except
that
I
called
my
son
my
cousin
;
and
first
I
told
him
that
I
had
*NL*
lost
my
watch
,
which
he
seemed
to
take
as
a
misfortune
;
but
then
I
told
*NL*
him
how
kind
my
cousin
had
been
,
that
my
mother
had
left
me
such
a
*NL*
plantation
,
and
that
he
had
preserved
it
for
me
,
in
hopes
some
time
or
*NL*
other
he
should
hear
from
me
;
then
I
told
him
that
I
had
left
it
to
his
*NL*
management
,
that
he
would
render
me
a
faithful
account
of
its
produce
;
*NL*
and
then
I
pulled
him
out
the
#
100
in
silver
,
as
the
first
year
's
*NL*
produce
;
and
then
pulling
out
the
deerskin
purse
with
the
pistoles
,
*NL*
`
And
here
,
my
dear
,
'
says
I
,
`
is
the
gold
watch
.
'
My
husband
--
so
is
*NL*
Heaven
's
goodness
sure
to
work
the
same
effects
in
all
sensible
minds
*NL*
where
mercies
touch
the
heart
--
lifted
up
both
hands
,
and
with
an
*NL*
ecstacy
of
joy
,
`
What
is
God
a-doing
,
'
says
he
,
`
for
such
an
ungrateful
*NL*
dog
as
I
am
!
'
Then
I
let
him
know
what
I
had
brought
over
in
the
*NL*
sloop
,
besides
all
this
;
I
mean
the
horses
,
hogs
,
and
cows
,
and
other
*NL*
stores
for
our
plantation
;
all
which
added
to
his
surprise
,
and
filled
*NL*
his
heart
with
thankfulness
;
and
from
this
time
forward
I
believe
he
*NL*
was
as
sincere
a
penitent
,
and
as
thoroughly
a
reformed
man
,
as
ever
*NL*
God
's
goodness
brought
back
from
a
profligate
,
a
highwayman
,
and
a
*NL*
robber
.
I
could
fill
a
larger
history
than
this
with
the
evidence
of
*NL*
this
truth
,
and
but
that
I
doubt
that
part
of
the
story
will
not
be
*NL*
equally
diverting
as
the
wicked
part
,
I
have
had
thoughts
of
making
a
*NL*
volume
of
it
by
itself
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
myself
,
as
this
is
to
be
my
own
story
,
not
my
husband
's
,
I
*NL*
return
to
that
part
which
related
to
myself
.
We
went
on
with
our
*NL*
plantation
,
and
managed
it
with
the
help
and
diversion
of
such
friends
*NL*
as
we
got
there
by
our
obliging
behaviour
,
and
especially
the
honest
*NL*
Quaker
,
who
proved
a
faithful
,
generous
,
and
steady
friend
to
us
;
and
*NL*
we
had
very
good
success
,
for
having
a
flourishing
stock
to
begin
with
,
*NL*
as
I
have
said
,
and
this
being
now
increased
by
the
addition
of
#
150
*NL*
sterling
in
money
,
we
enlarged
our
number
of
servants
,
built
us
a
very
*NL*
good
house
,
and
cured
every
year
a
great
deal
of
land
.
The
second
year
*NL*
I
wrote
to
my
old
governess
,
giving
her
part
with
us
of
the
joy
of
our
*NL*
success
,
and
order
her
how
to
lay
out
the
money
I
had
left
with
her
,
*NL*
which
was
#
250
as
above
,
and
to
send
it
to
us
in
goods
,
which
she
*NL*
performed
with
her
usual
kindness
and
fidelity
,
and
this
arrived
safe
*NL*
to
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
we
had
a
supply
of
all
sorts
of
clothes
,
as
well
for
my
husband
as
*NL*
for
myself
;
and
I
took
especial
care
to
buy
for
him
all
those
things
*NL*
that
I
knew
he
delighted
to
have
;
as
two
good
long
wigs
,
two
*NL*
silver-hilted
swords
,
three
or
four
fine
fowling-pieces
,
a
fine
saddle
*NL*
with
holsters
and
pistols
very
handsome
,
with
a
scarlet
cloak
;
and
,
in
*NL*
a
word
,
everything
I
could
think
of
to
oblige
him
,
and
to
make
him
*NL*
appear
,
as
he
really
was
,
a
very
fine
gentleman
.
I
ordered
a
good
*NL*
quantity
of
such
household
stuff
as
we
yet
wanted
,
with
linen
of
all
*NL*
sorts
for
us
both
.
As
for
myself
,
I
wanted
very
little
of
clothes
or
*NL*
linen
,
being
very
well
furnished
before
.
The
rest
of
my
cargo
*NL*
consisted
in
iron-work
of
all
sorts
,
harness
for
horses
,
tools
,
clothes
*NL*
for
servants
,
and
woollen
cloth
,
stuffs
,
serges
,
stockings
,
shoes
,
*NL*
hats
,
and
the
like
,
such
as
servants
wear
;
and
whole
pieces
also
to
*NL*
make
up
for
servants
,
all
by
direction
of
the
Quaker
;
and
all
this
*NL*
cargo
arrived
safe
,
and
in
good
condition
,
with
three
woman-servants
,
*NL*
lusty
wenches
,
which
my
old
governess
had
picked
for
me
,
suitable
*NL*
enough
to
the
place
,
and
to
the
work
we
had
for
them
to
do
;
one
of
*NL*
which
happened
to
come
double
,
having
been
got
with
child
by
one
of
the
*NL*
seamen
in
the
ship
,
as
she
owned
afterwards
,
before
the
ship
got
so
far
*NL*
as
Gravesend
;
so
she
brought
us
a
stout
boy
,
about
seven
months
after
*NL*
her
landing
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
husband
,
you
may
suppose
,
was
a
little
surprised
at
the
arriving
of
*NL*
all
this
cargo
from
England
;
and
talking
with
me
after
he
saw
the
*NL*
account
of
this
particular
,
`
My
dear
,
'
says
he
,
`
what
is
the
meaning
of
*NL*
all
this
?
I
fear
you
will
run
us
too
deep
in
debt
:
when
shall
we
be
*NL*
able
to
make
return
for
it
all
?
'
I
smiled
,
and
told
him
that
is
was
all
*NL*
paid
for
;
and
then
I
told
him
,
that
what
our
circumstances
might
expose
*NL*
us
to
,
I
had
not
taken
my
whole
stock
with
me
,
that
I
had
reserved
so
*NL*
much
in
my
friend
's
hands
,
which
now
we
were
come
over
safe
,
and
was
*NL*
settled
in
a
way
to
live
,
I
had
sent
for
,
as
he
might
see
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
amazed
,
and
stood
a
while
telling
upon
his
fingers
,
but
said
*NL*
nothing
.
At
last
he
began
thus
:
`
Hold
,
let
's
see
,
'
says
he
,
telling
*NL*
upon
his
fingers
still
,
and
first
on
his
thumb
;
`
there
's
#
246
in
money
*NL*
at
first
,
then
two
gold
watches
,
diamond
rings
,
and
plate
,
'
says
he
,
*NL*
upon
the
forefinger
.
Then
upon
the
next
finger
,
`
Here
's
a
plantation
*NL*
on
York
River
,
#
100
a
year
,
then
#
150
in
money
,
then
a
sloop
load
of
*NL*
horses
,
cows
,
hogs
,
and
stores
'
;
and
so
on
to
the
thumb
again
.
`
And
*NL*
now
,
'
says
he
,
'
a
cargo
cost
#
250
in
England
,
and
worth
here
twice
the
*NL*
money
.
'
`
Well
,
'
says
I
,
`
what
do
you
make
of
all
that
?
'
`
Make
of
it
?
'
*NL*
says
he
;
`
why
,
who
says
I
was
deceived
when
I
married
a
wife
in
*NL*
Lancashire
?
I
think
I
have
married
a
fortune
,
and
a
very
good
fortune
*NL*
too
,
'
says
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
word
,
we
were
now
in
very
considerable
circumstances
,
and
every
*NL*
year
increasing
;
for
our
new
plantation
grew
upon
our
hands
insensibly
,
*NL*
and
in
eight
years
which
we
lived
upon
it
,
we
brought
it
to
such
pitch
,
*NL*
that
the
produce
was
at
least
#
300
sterling
a
year
;
I
mean
,
worth
so
*NL*
much
in
England
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
I
had
been
a
year
at
home
again
,
I
went
over
the
bay
to
see
my
*NL*
son
,
and
to
receive
another
year
's
income
of
my
plantation
;
and
I
was
*NL*
surprised
to
hear
,
just
at
my
landing
there
,
that
my
old
husband
was
*NL*
dead
,
and
had
not
been
buried
above
a
fortnight
.
This
,
I
confess
,
was
*NL*
not
disagreeable
news
,
because
now
I
could
appear
as
I
was
,
in
a
*NL*
married
condition
;
so
I
told
my
son
before
I
came
from
him
,
that
I
*NL*
believed
I
should
marry
a
gentleman
who
had
a
plantation
near
mine
;
and
*NL*
though
I
was
legally
free
to
marry
,
as
to
any
obligation
that
was
on
me
*NL*
before
,
yet
that
I
was
shy
of
it
,
lest
the
blot
should
some
time
or
*NL*
other
be
revived
,
and
it
might
make
a
husband
uneasy
.
My
son
,
the
same
*NL*
kind
,
dutiful
,
and
obliging
creature
as
ever
,
treated
me
now
at
his
own
*NL*
house
,
paid
me
my
hundred
pounds
,
and
sent
me
home
again
loaded
with
*NL*
presents
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
time
after
this
,
I
let
my
son
know
I
was
married
,
and
invited
him
*NL*
over
to
see
us
,
and
my
husband
wrote
a
very
obliging
letter
to
him
*NL*
also
,
inviting
him
to
come
and
see
him
;
and
he
came
accordingly
some
*NL*
months
after
,
and
happened
to
be
there
just
when
my
cargo
from
England
*NL*
came
in
,
which
I
let
him
believe
belonged
all
to
my
husband
's
estate
,
*NL*
not
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
must
be
observed
that
when
the
old
wretch
my
brother
-LRB-
husband
-RRB-
was
*NL*
dead
,
I
then
freely
gave
my
husband
an
account
of
all
that
affair
,
and
*NL*
of
this
cousin
,
as
I
had
called
him
before
,
being
my
own
son
by
that
*NL*
mistaken
unhappy
match
.
He
was
perfectly
easy
in
the
account
,
and
told
*NL*
me
he
should
have
been
as
easy
if
the
old
man
,
as
we
called
him
,
had
*NL*
been
alive
.
`
For
,
'
said
he
,
`
it
was
no
fault
of
yours
,
nor
of
his
;
it
*NL*
was
a
mistake
impossible
to
be
prevented
.
'
He
only
reproached
him
with
*NL*
desiring
me
to
conceal
it
,
and
to
live
with
him
as
a
wife
,
after
I
knew
*NL*
that
he
was
my
brother
;
that
,
he
said
,
was
a
vile
part
.
Thus
all
these
*NL*
difficulties
were
made
easy
,
and
we
lived
together
with
the
greatest
*NL*
kindness
and
comfort
imaginable
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
are
grown
old
;
I
am
come
back
to
England
,
being
almost
seventy
years
*NL*
of
age
,
husband
sixty-eight
,
having
performed
much
more
than
the
*NL*
limited
terms
of
my
transportation
;
and
now
,
notwithstanding
all
the
*NL*
fatigues
and
all
the
miseries
we
have
both
gone
through
,
we
are
both
of
*NL*
us
in
good
heart
and
health
.
My
husband
remained
there
some
time
after
*NL*
me
to
settle
our
affairs
,
and
at
first
I
had
intended
to
go
back
to
*NL*
him
,
but
at
his
desire
I
altered
that
resolution
,
and
he
is
come
over
*NL*
to
England
also
,
where
we
resolve
to
spend
the
remainder
of
our
years
*NL*
in
sincere
penitence
for
the
wicked
lives
we
have
lived
.
