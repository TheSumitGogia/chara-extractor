Marseilles
--
The
Arrival
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
24th
of
February
,
1815
,
the
look-out
at
Notre-Dame
de
la
Garde
*NL*
signalled
the
three-master
,
the
Pharaon
from
Smyrna
,
Trieste
,
and
*NL*
Naples
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
usual
,
a
pilot
put
off
immediately
,
and
rounding
the
Chateau
d'If
,
*NL*
got
on
board
the
vessel
between
Cape
Morgion
and
Rion
island
.
*NL*
*NL*
Immediately
,
and
according
to
custom
,
the
ramparts
of
Fort
Saint-Jean
*NL*
were
covered
with
spectators
;
it
is
always
an
event
at
Marseilles
for
a
*NL*
ship
to
come
into
port
,
especially
when
this
ship
,
like
the
Pharaon
,
has
*NL*
been
built
,
rigged
,
and
laden
at
the
old
Phocee
docks
,
and
belongs
to
an
*NL*
owner
of
the
city
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
ship
drew
on
and
had
safely
passed
the
strait
,
which
some
volcanic
*NL*
shock
has
made
between
the
Calasareigne
and
Jaros
islands
;
had
doubled
*NL*
Pomegue
,
and
approached
the
harbor
under
topsails
,
jib
,
and
spanker
,
but
*NL*
so
slowly
and
sedately
that
the
idlers
,
with
that
instinct
which
is
*NL*
the
forerunner
of
evil
,
asked
one
another
what
misfortune
could
have
*NL*
happened
on
board
.
However
,
those
experienced
in
navigation
saw
plainly
*NL*
that
if
any
accident
had
occurred
,
it
was
not
to
the
vessel
herself
,
*NL*
for
she
bore
down
with
all
the
evidence
of
being
skilfully
handled
,
the
*NL*
anchor
a-cockbill
,
the
jib-boom
guys
already
eased
off
,
and
standing
by
*NL*
the
side
of
the
pilot
,
who
was
steering
the
Pharaon
towards
the
narrow
*NL*
entrance
of
the
inner
port
,
was
a
young
man
,
who
,
with
activity
and
*NL*
vigilant
eye
,
watched
every
motion
of
the
ship
,
and
repeated
each
*NL*
direction
of
the
pilot
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
vague
disquietude
which
prevailed
among
the
spectators
had
so
much
*NL*
affected
one
of
the
crowd
that
he
did
not
await
the
arrival
of
the
*NL*
vessel
in
harbor
,
but
jumping
into
a
small
skiff
,
desired
to
be
pulled
*NL*
alongside
the
Pharaon
,
which
he
reached
as
she
rounded
into
La
Reserve
*NL*
basin
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
young
man
on
board
saw
this
person
approach
,
he
left
his
*NL*
station
by
the
pilot
,
and
,
hat
in
hand
,
leaned
over
the
ship
's
bulwarks
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
a
fine
,
tall
,
slim
young
fellow
of
eighteen
or
twenty
,
with
*NL*
black
eyes
,
and
hair
as
dark
as
a
raven
's
wing
;
and
his
whole
appearance
*NL*
bespoke
that
calmness
and
resolution
peculiar
to
men
accustomed
from
*NL*
their
cradle
to
contend
with
danger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
is
it
you
,
Dantes
?
''
cried
the
man
in
the
skiff
.
``
What
's
the
matter
?
*NL*
and
why
have
you
such
an
air
of
sadness
aboard
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
great
misfortune
,
M.
Morrel
,
''
replied
the
young
man
,
--
``
a
great
*NL*
misfortune
,
for
me
especially
!
Off
Civita
Vecchia
we
lost
our
brave
*NL*
Captain
Leclere
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
the
cargo
?
''
inquired
the
owner
,
eagerly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
all
safe
,
M.
Morrel
;
and
I
think
you
will
be
satisfied
on
that
head
.
*NL*
But
poor
Captain
Leclere
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
happened
to
him
?
''
asked
the
owner
,
with
an
air
of
considerable
*NL*
resignation
.
``
What
happened
to
the
worthy
captain
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
died
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fell
into
the
sea
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
,
he
died
of
brain-fever
in
dreadful
agony
.
''
Then
turning
to
the
*NL*
crew
,
he
said
,
``
Bear
a
hand
there
,
to
take
in
sail
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
hands
obeyed
,
and
at
once
the
eight
or
ten
seamen
who
composed
the
*NL*
crew
,
sprang
to
their
respective
stations
at
the
spanker
brails
and
*NL*
outhaul
,
topsail
sheets
and
halyards
,
the
jib
downhaul
,
and
the
topsail
*NL*
clewlines
and
buntlines
.
The
young
sailor
gave
a
look
to
see
that
his
*NL*
orders
were
promptly
and
accurately
obeyed
,
and
then
turned
again
to
the
*NL*
owner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
did
this
misfortune
occur
?
''
inquired
the
latter
,
resuming
the
*NL*
interrupted
conversation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas
,
sir
,
in
the
most
unexpected
manner
.
After
a
long
talk
with
the
*NL*
harbor-master
,
Captain
Leclere
left
Naples
greatly
disturbed
in
mind
.
*NL*
In
twenty-four
hours
he
was
attacked
by
a
fever
,
and
died
three
days
*NL*
afterwards
.
We
performed
the
usual
burial
service
,
and
he
is
at
his
*NL*
rest
,
sewn
up
in
his
hammock
with
a
thirty-six
pound
shot
at
his
head
*NL*
and
his
heels
,
off
El
Giglio
island
.
We
bring
to
his
widow
his
sword
and
*NL*
cross
of
honor
.
It
was
worth
while
,
truly
,
''
added
the
young
man
with
a
*NL*
melancholy
smile
,
``
to
make
war
against
the
English
for
ten
years
,
and
to
*NL*
die
in
his
bed
at
last
,
like
everybody
else
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
you
see
,
Edmond
,
''
replied
the
owner
,
who
appeared
more
comforted
*NL*
at
every
moment
,
``
we
are
all
mortal
,
and
the
old
must
make
way
for
the
*NL*
young
.
If
not
,
why
,
there
would
be
no
promotion
;
and
since
you
assure
me
*NL*
that
the
cargo
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
all
safe
and
sound
,
M.
Morrel
,
take
my
word
for
it
;
and
I
advise
you
*NL*
not
to
take
25,000
francs
for
the
profits
of
the
voyage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
as
they
were
just
passing
the
Round
Tower
,
the
young
man
shouted
:
*NL*
``
Stand
by
there
to
lower
the
topsails
and
jib
;
brail
up
the
spanker
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
order
was
executed
as
promptly
as
it
would
have
been
on
board
a
*NL*
man-of-war
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
go
--
and
clue
up
!
''
At
this
last
command
all
the
sails
were
lowered
,
*NL*
and
the
vessel
moved
almost
imperceptibly
onwards
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
if
you
will
come
on
board
,
M.
Morrel
,
''
said
Dantes
,
observing
the
*NL*
owner
's
impatience
,
``
here
is
your
supercargo
,
M.
Danglars
,
coming
out
of
*NL*
his
cabin
,
who
will
furnish
you
with
every
particular
.
As
for
me
,
I
must
*NL*
look
after
the
anchoring
,
and
dress
the
ship
in
mourning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
owner
did
not
wait
for
a
second
invitation
.
He
seized
a
rope
which
*NL*
Dantes
flung
to
him
,
and
with
an
activity
that
would
have
done
credit
to
*NL*
a
sailor
,
climbed
up
the
side
of
the
ship
,
while
the
young
man
,
going
*NL*
to
his
task
,
left
the
conversation
to
Danglars
,
who
now
came
towards
*NL*
the
owner
.
He
was
a
man
of
twenty-five
or
twenty-six
years
of
age
,
of
*NL*
unprepossessing
countenance
,
obsequious
to
his
superiors
,
insolent
to
*NL*
his
subordinates
;
and
this
,
in
addition
to
his
position
as
responsible
*NL*
agent
on
board
,
which
is
always
obnoxious
to
the
sailors
,
made
him
as
*NL*
much
disliked
by
the
crew
as
Edmond
Dantes
was
beloved
by
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
M.
Morrel
,
''
said
Danglars
,
``
you
have
heard
of
the
misfortune
that
*NL*
has
befallen
us
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
yes
:
poor
Captain
Leclere
!
He
was
a
brave
and
an
honest
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
a
first-rate
seaman
,
one
who
had
seen
long
and
honorable
service
,
*NL*
as
became
a
man
charged
with
the
interests
of
a
house
so
important
as
*NL*
that
of
Morrel
&
Son
,
''
replied
Danglars
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
''
replied
the
owner
,
glancing
after
Dantes
,
who
was
watching
the
*NL*
anchoring
of
his
vessel
,
``
it
seems
to
me
that
a
sailor
needs
not
be
so
*NL*
old
as
you
say
,
Danglars
,
to
understand
his
business
,
for
our
friend
*NL*
Edmond
seems
to
understand
it
thoroughly
,
and
not
to
require
instruction
*NL*
from
any
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Danglars
,
darting
at
Edmond
a
look
gleaming
with
hate
.
``
Yes
,
*NL*
he
is
young
,
and
youth
is
invariably
self-confident
.
Scarcely
was
the
*NL*
captain
's
breath
out
of
his
body
when
he
assumed
the
command
without
*NL*
consulting
any
one
,
and
he
caused
us
to
lose
a
day
and
a
half
at
the
*NL*
Island
of
Elba
,
instead
of
making
for
Marseilles
direct
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
to
taking
command
of
the
vessel
,
''
replied
Morrel
,
``
that
was
his
duty
*NL*
as
captain
's
mate
;
as
to
losing
a
day
and
a
half
off
the
Island
of
Elba
,
*NL*
he
was
wrong
,
unless
the
vessel
needed
repairs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
vessel
was
in
as
good
condition
as
I
am
,
and
as
,
I
hope
you
are
,
*NL*
M.
Morrel
,
and
this
day
and
a
half
was
lost
from
pure
whim
,
for
the
*NL*
pleasure
of
going
ashore
,
and
nothing
else
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dantes
,
''
said
the
shipowner
,
turning
towards
the
young
man
,
``
come
this
*NL*
way
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
a
moment
,
sir
,
''
answered
Dantes
,
``
and
I
'm
with
you
.
''
Then
calling
to
*NL*
the
crew
,
he
said
--
``
Let
go
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
anchor
was
instantly
dropped
,
and
the
chain
ran
rattling
through
the
*NL*
port-hole
.
Dantes
continued
at
his
post
in
spite
of
the
presence
of
the
*NL*
pilot
,
until
this
manoeuvre
was
completed
,
and
then
he
added
,
``
Half-mast
*NL*
the
colors
,
and
square
the
yards
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
''
said
Danglars
,
``
he
fancies
himself
captain
already
,
upon
my
*NL*
word
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
so
,
in
fact
,
he
is
,

said
the
owner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Except
your
signature
and
your
partner
's
,
M.
Morrel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
why
should
he
not
have
this
?
''
asked
the
owner
;
``
he
is
young
,
it
is
*NL*
true
,
but
he
seems
to
me
a
thorough
seaman
,
and
of
full
experience
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
cloud
passed
over
Danglars
'
brow
.
``
Your
pardon
,
M.
Morrel
,
''
said
*NL*
Dantes
,
approaching
,
``
the
vessel
now
rides
at
anchor

I
am
at
your
*NL*
service

You
hailed
me

I
think
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Danglars
retreated
a
step
or
two
.
``
I
wished
to
inquire
why
you
stopped
*NL*
at
the
Island
of
Elba
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
know
,
sir
;
it
was
to
fulfil
the
last
instructions
of
Captain
*NL*
Leclere
,
who
,
when
dying
,
gave
me
a
packet
for
Marshal
Bertrand
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
did
you
see
him

``
Who

*NL*
*NL*
``
The
marshal

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

''
*NL*
*NL*
Morrel
looked
around
him
,
and
then
,
drawing
Dantes
on
one
side
,
he
said
*NL*
suddenly
--
``
And
how
is
the
emperor
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
as
far
as
I
could
judge
from
the
sight
of
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
saw
the
emperor

then
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
He
entered
the
marshal
's
apartment
while
I
was
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
spoke
to
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
it
was
he
who
spoke
to
me
,
sir
,
''
said
Dantes
,
with
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
did
he
say
to
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Asked
me
questions
about
the
vessel
,
the
time
she
left
Marseilles
,
the
*NL*
course
she
had
taken
,
and
what
was
her
cargo
.
I
believe
,
if
she
had
not
*NL*
been
laden
,
and
I
had
been
her
master
,
he
would
have
bought
her
.
But
I
*NL*
told
him
I
was
only
mate
,
and
that
she
belonged
to
the
firm
of
Morrel
&
*NL*
Son
.
`
Ah
,
yes
,
'
he
said
,
'
I
know
them
.
The
Morrels
have
been
shipowners
*NL*
from
father
to
son
;
and
there
was
a
Morrel
who
served
in
the
same
*NL*
regiment
with
me
when
I
was
in
garrison
at
Valence
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Pardieu

that
is
true

cried
the
owner

greatly
delighted
.

that
was
Policar
Morrel
,
my
uncle

who
was
afterwards
a
captain

Dantes
,
*NL*
you
must
tell
my
uncle
that
the
emperor
remembered
him
,
and
you
will
see
*NL*
it
will
bring
tears
into
the
old
soldier
's
eyes

Come
,
come

''
continued
*NL*
he
,
patting
Edmond
's
shoulder
kindly
,
``
you
did
very
right
,
Dantes
,
to
*NL*
follow
Captain
Leclere
's
instructions
,
and
touch
at
Elba
,
although
if
*NL*
it
were
known
that
you
had
conveyed
a
packet
to
the
marshal
,
and
had
*NL*
conversed
with
the
emperor
,
it
might
bring
you
into
trouble
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
could
that
bring
me
into
trouble
,
sir
?
''
asked
Dantes
;
``
for
I
did
*NL*
not
even
know
of
what
I
was
the
bearer

and
the
emperor
merely
made
such
*NL*
inquiries
as
he
would
of
the
first
comer
.
But
,
pardon
me
,
here
are
the
*NL*
health
officers
and
the
customs
inspectors
coming
alongside
.

And
the
*NL*
young
man
went
to
the
gangway
.
As
he
departed
,
Danglars
approached
,
and

said

replied
the
owner

Danglars
turned
very
red
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
passing
close
to
the
door

the
captain

cabin

was
half

open

I
saw
him
give
the

*NL*
*NL*

He
did
not

any

Danglars
reflected
for
a
moment

M.

I
beg

the

Dantes
smiled

True

impatiently

blushed

the

That

Do
you

mean
is

a
good
comrade
?
No
,
for
I
think
he
never
liked
me
since
the
*NL*
day
when
I
was
silly
enough
,
after
a
little
quarrel
we
had

to
propose

to
him
to
stop
for
ten
minutes
at
the
island

Monte

settle

the
dispute

a
proposition

I
was
wrong

suggest

quite
*NL*
right

refuse

If
you
mean
as
responsible
agent
when
you
ask
me
the

question

I
believe
there
is
nothing
to
say
against

be
content

*NL*
*NL*
The
young
sailor
jumped
into
the
skiff
,
and
sat
down
in
the
stern
*NL*
sheets
,
with
the
order
that
he
be
put
ashore
at
La
Canebiere
.
The
two
*NL*
oarsmen
bent
to
their
work
,
and
the
little
boat
glided
away
as
rapidly
*NL*
as
possible
in
the
midst
of
the
thousand
vessels
which
choke
up
the
*NL*
narrow
way
which
leads
between
the
two
rows
of
ships
from
the
mouth
of
*NL*
the
harbor
to
the
Quai
d'Orleans
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
shipowner
,
smiling
,
followed
him
with
his
eyes
until
he
saw
him
*NL*
spring
out
on
the
quay
and
disappear
in
the
midst
of
the
throng
,
which
*NL*
from
five
o'clock
in
the
morning
until
nine
o'clock
at
night
,
swarms
*NL*
in
the
famous
street
of
La
Canebiere
,
--
a
street
of
which
the
modern
*NL*
Phocaeans
are
so
proud
that
they
say
with
all
the
gravity
in
the
world
,
*NL*
and
with
that
accent
which
gives
so
much
character
to
what
is
said
,
``
If
*NL*
Paris
had
La
Canebiere
,
Paris
would
be
a
second
Marseilles

On
turning
*NL*
round
the
owner
saw
Danglars
behind
him
,
apparently
awaiting
orders
,
*NL*
but
in
reality
also
watching
the
young
sailor
,
--
but
there
was
a
great
*NL*
difference
in
the
expression
of
the
two
men

thus
followed

movements

Father

*NL*
*NL*
We
will
leave
Danglars
struggling
with
the
demon
of
hatred
,
and
*NL*
endeavoring
to
insinuate
in
the
ear
of
the
shipowner
some
evil
*NL*
suspicions
against
his
comrade
,
and
follow
Dantes
,
who
,
after
having
*NL*
traversed
La
Canebiere
,
took
the
Rue
de
Noailles
,
and
entering
a
small
*NL*
house
,
on
the
left
of
the
Allees
de
Meillan
,
rapidly
ascended
four
*NL*
flights
of
a
dark
staircase
,
holding
the
baluster
with
one
hand
,
while
*NL*
with
the
other
he
repressed
the
beatings
of
his
heart
,
and
paused
before
*NL*
a
half-open
door
,
from
which
he
could
see
the
whole
of
a
small
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
room
was
occupied
by
Dantes
'
father
.
The
news
of
the
arrival
of
the
*NL*
Pharaon
had
not
yet
reached
the
old
man
,
who
,
mounted
on
a
chair
,
was
*NL*
amusing
himself
by
training
with
trembling
hand
the
nasturtiums
and
*NL*
sprays
of
clematis
that
clambered
over
the
trellis
at
his
window
.
*NL*
Suddenly
,
he
felt
an
arm
thrown
around
his
body
,
and
a
well-known
voice
*NL*
behind
him
exclaimed
,
``
Father
--
dear
father
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
man
uttered
a
cry
,
and
turned
round
;
then
,
seeing
his
son
,
he
*NL*
fell
into
his
arms
,
pale
and
trembling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
ails
you
,
my
dearest
father
?
Are
you
ill
?
''
inquired
the
young
man
,
*NL*
much
alarmed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

no

dear
Edmond

my

my

no

I
did
not
expect
you
;
*NL*
and
joy

the
surprise
of
seeing
you
so
suddenly

Ah

I
feel
as

going
to
die

*NL*
``
Come

up

say
joy
*NL*
never
hurts

and
so
I
came
to
you
without
any
warning
.
Come
now
,
do
*NL*
smile
,
instead
of
looking
at
me
so
solemnly

Here
I
am
back
again

*NL*
we
are
going
to
be
happy

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

yes

the
old
man
;
``

*NL*
how
shall
we
be
happy

never
leave

again

good
fortune

has
befallen
you

*NL*
``

said
the
young
man
,
``
for
rejoicing
at
happiness

derived
from

misery

good
Captain
Leclere
is
dead
,
father
,
and
it
is
probable
*NL*
that
,
with
the
aid
of
M.
Morrel
,
I
shall
have
his
place
.
Do
you
*NL*
understand
,
father
?
Only
imagine
me
a
captain
at
twenty
,
with
a
hundred
*NL*
louis
pay
,
and
a
share
in
the
profits
!
Is
this
not
more
than
a
poor
*NL*
sailor
like
me
could
have
hoped
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
my
dear
boy
,
''
replied
the
old
man
,
``
it
is
very
fortunate
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
with
the
first
money
I
touch
,
I
mean
you
to
have
a
small
*NL*
house
,
with
a
garden
in
which
to
plant
clematis
,
nasturtiums
,
and
*NL*
honeysuckle
.
But
what
ails
you
,
father
?
Are
you
not
well
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
nothing
,
nothing
;
it
will
soon
pass
away
''
--
and
as
he
said
so
the
*NL*
old
man
's
strength
failed
him
,
and
he
fell
backwards
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
come
,
''
said
the
young
man
,
``
a
glass
of
wine
,
father
,
will
revive
*NL*
you
.
Where
do
you
keep
your
wine
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
;
thanks
.
You
need
not
look
for
it
;
I
do
not
want
it
,
''
said
the
*NL*
old
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
father
,
tell
me
where
it
is
,
''
and
he
opened
two
or
three
*NL*
cupboards
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
no
use
,
''
said
the
old
man
,
``
there
is
no
wine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
no
wine
?
''
said
Dantes
,
turning
pale
,
and
looking
alternately
*NL*
at
the
hollow
cheeks
of
the
old
man
and
the
empty
cupboards
.
``
What
,
no
*NL*
wine
?
Have
you
wanted
money
,
father
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
nothing
now
that
I
have
you
,
''
said
the
old
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yet
,
''
stammered
Dantes
,
wiping
the
perspiration
from
his
brow
,
--
``
yet
I
*NL*
gave
you
two
hundred
francs
when
I
left
,
three
months
ago
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
Edmond
,
that
is
true
,
but
you
forgot
at
that
time
a
little
*NL*
debt
to
our
neighbor
,
Caderousse
.
He
reminded
me
of
it
,
telling
me
if
*NL*
I
did
not
pay
for
you
,
he
would
be
paid
by
M.
Morrel
;
and
so
,
you
see
,
*NL*
lest
he
might
do
you
an
injury
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
I
paid
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
''
cried
Dantes
,
``
it
was
a
hundred
and
forty
francs
I
owed
*NL*
Caderousse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
stammered
the
old
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
paid
him
out
of
the
two
hundred
francs
I
left
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
man
nodded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
that
you
have
lived
for
three
months
on
sixty
francs
,
''
muttered
*NL*
Edmond
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
how
little
I
require
,
''
said
the
old
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Heaven
pardon
me
,
''
cried
Edmond
,
falling
on
his
knees
before
his
*NL*
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
doing
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
wounded
me
to
the
heart
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
mind
it
,
for
I
see
you
once
more
,
''
said
the
old
man
;
``
and
now
*NL*
it
's
all
over
--
everything
is
all
right
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
here
I
am
,
''
said
the
young
man
,
``
with
a
promising
future
and
a
*NL*
little
money
.
Here
,
father
,
here
!
''
he
said
,
``
take
this
--
take
it
,
and
*NL*
send
for
something
immediately
.
''
And
he
emptied
his
pockets
on
the
*NL*
table
,
the
contents
consisting
of
a
dozen
gold
pieces
,
five
or
six
*NL*
five-franc
pieces
,
and
some
smaller
coin
.
The
countenance
of
old
Dantes
*NL*
brightened
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whom
does
this
belong
to
?
''
he
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
me
,
to
you
,
to
us
!
Take
it
;
buy
some
provisions
;
be
happy
,
and
*NL*
to-morrow
we
shall
have
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gently
,
gently
,
''
said
the
old
man
,
with
a
smile
;
``
and
by
your
leave
I
*NL*
will
use
your
purse
moderately
,
for
they
would
say
,
if
they
saw
me
buy
*NL*
too
many
things
at
a
time
,
that
I
had
been
obliged
to
await
your
return
,
*NL*
in
order
to
be
able
to
purchase
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
as
you
please
;
but
,
first
of
all
,
pray
have
a
servant
,
father
.
I
*NL*
will
not
have
you
left
alone
so
long
.
I
have
some
smuggled
coffee
and
*NL*
most
capital
tobacco
,
in
a
small
chest
in
the
hold
,
which
you
shall
have
*NL*
to-morrow
.
But
,
hush
,
here
comes
somebody
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
Caderousse
,
who
has
heard
of
your
arrival
,
and
no
doubt
comes
to
*NL*
congratulate
you
on
your
fortunate
return
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
lips
that
say
one
thing
,
while
the
heart
thinks
another
,
''
murmured
*NL*
Edmond
.
``
But
,
never
mind
,
he
is
a
neighbor
who
has
done
us
a
service
on
*NL*
a
time
,
so
he
's
welcome
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
Edmond
paused
,
the
black
and
bearded
head
of
Caderousse
appeared
at
*NL*
the
door
.
He
was
a
man
of
twenty-five
or
six
,
and
held
a
piece
of
cloth
,
*NL*
which
,
being
a
tailor
,
he
was
about
to
make
into
a
coat-lining
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
is
it
you
,
Edmond
,
back
again
?
''
said
he
,
with
a
broad
*NL*
Marseillaise
accent
,
and
a
grin
that
displayed
his
ivory-white
teeth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
as
you
see
,
neighbor
Caderousse
;
and
ready
to
be
agreeable
to
you
*NL*
in
any
and
every
way
,
''
replied
Dantes
,
but
ill-concealing
his
coldness
*NL*
under
this
cloak
of
civility
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thanks
--
thanks
;
but
,
fortunately
,
I
do
not
want
for
anything
;
and
it
*NL*
chances
that
at
times
there
are
others
who
have
need
of
me
.
''
Dantes
made
*NL*
a
gesture
.
``
I
do
not
allude
to
you
,
my
boy
.
No
!
--
no
!
I
lent
you
money
,
*NL*
and
you
returned
it
;
that
's
like
good
neighbors
,
and
we
are
quits
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
never
quits
with
those
who
oblige
us
,
''
was
Dantes
'
reply
;
``
for
*NL*
when
we
do
not
owe
them
money
,
we
owe
them
gratitude
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
use
of
mentioning
that
?
What
is
done
is
done
.
Let
us
talk
*NL*
of
your
happy
return
,
my
boy
.
I
had
gone
on
the
quay
to
match
a
piece
of
*NL*
mulberry
cloth
,
when
I
met
friend
Danglars
.
`
You
at
Marseilles
?
'
--
`
Yes
,
'
*NL*
says
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
'
I
thought
you
were
at
Smyrna
.
'
--
'
I
was
;
but
am
now
back
again
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
And
where
is
the
dear
boy
,
our
little
Edmond
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Why
,
with
his
father
,
no
doubt
,
'
replied
Danglars
.
And
so
I
came
,
''
*NL*
added
Caderousse
,
``
as
fast
as
I
could
to
have
the
pleasure
of
shaking
*NL*
hands
with
a
friend
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Worthy
Caderousse
!
''
said
the
old
man
,
``
he
is
so
much
attached
to
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
to
be
sure
I
am
.
I
love
and
esteem
you
,
because
honest
folks
are
*NL*
so
rare
.
But
it
seems
you
have
come
back
rich
,
my
boy
,
''
continued
the
*NL*
tailor
,
looking
askance
at
the
handful
of
gold
and
silver
which
Dantes
*NL*
had
thrown
on
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
remarked
the
greedy
glance
which
shone
in
the
dark
eyes
of
*NL*
his
neighbor
.
``
Eh
,
''
he
said
,
negligently
,
``
this
money
is
not
mine
.
I
was
*NL*
expressing
to
my
father
my
fears
that
he
had
wanted
many
things
in
my
*NL*
absence
,
and
to
convince
me
he
emptied
his
purse
on
the
table
.
Come
,
*NL*
father
''
added
Dantes
,
``
put
this
money
back
in
your
box
--
unless
neighbor
*NL*
Caderousse
wants
anything
,
and
in
that
case
it
is
at
his
service
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
my
boy
,
no
,
''
said
Caderousse
.
``
I
am
not
in
any
want

God

*NL*
my
living
is
suited
to
my
means

Keep
your
money
--
keep
it
,
I
say
;

one
*NL*
never
has
too
much
;

but
,
at
the
same
time
,
my
boy
,
I
am
as
much
obliged
*NL*
by
your
offer
as
if
I
took
advantage
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
offered
with
good
will
,
''
said
Dantes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

my
boy

no

Well

you
stand
well
with
M.
Morrel

*NL*
hear

you
insinuating
dog

you

*NL*
*NL*
``
M.
Morrel
has
always
been
exceedingly
kind

me

Dantes

*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
were
wrong
to
refuse

dine
with
him

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
did
you
refuse
to
dine
with
him

old
Dantes

did
he
*NL*
invite
you
to
dine

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

my
dear
father

replied
Edmond
,
smiling
at
his
father
's
*NL*
astonishment
at
the
excessive
honor
paid
to
his
son
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
why
did
you
refuse

my
son
?

inquired
the
old
man

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
I
might
the
sooner
see
you
again

my
dear
father

replied
the
*NL*
young
man
.
``
I
was
most
anxious
to
see
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
must
have
vexed
M.
Morrel

good

worthy
man

said
Caderousse
.
*NL*
``
And
when
you
are
looking
forward
to
be
captain

it
was
wrong
to
annoy
*NL*
the
owner

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
explained
to
him
the
cause
of
my
refusal

replied
Dantes
,
``
and
I
*NL*
hope
he
fully
understood
it

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
to
be
captain
one
must
do
a
little
flattery
to
one

patrons

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope

be

without
that

Dantes

*NL*
``
So
much

so

Nothing

give
greater

I

down

Catalans

Go

So

yes

why

*NL*
*NL*

Because
Mercedes

dozens

had
in

traces

slight

uneasiness

*NL*

Ah

yes

Caderousse

*NL*
*NL*
``
Meaning

Dantes

ill-concealed

his

Caderousse
lingered

him
at

corner

going
quickly
to

they
called

bottle
of

two
glasses

*NL*
*NL*
Pere
Pamphile
had
seen
Dantes
pass
not
ten

assured

that
he
was
at
the
Catalans

they
sat
down
under
the
budding
foliage
*NL*
of
the
planes

sycamores
,
in

branches

Chapter

.
The
Catalans
.
*NL*
*NL*
Beyond
a
bare
,
weather-worn
wall
,
about
a
hundred
paces
from
the
spot
*NL*
where
the
two
friends
sat
looking
and
listening
as
they
drank
their
*NL*
wine
,
was
the
village
of
the
Catalans
.
Long
ago
this
mysterious
colony
*NL*
quitted
Spain
,
and
settled
on
the
tongue
of
land
on
which
it
is
to
this
*NL*
day
.
Whence
it
came
no
one
knew
,
and
it
spoke
an
unknown
tongue
.
One
of
*NL*
its
chiefs
,
who
understood
Provencal
,
begged
the
commune
of
Marseilles
*NL*
to
give
them
this
bare
and
barren
promontory
,
where
,
like
the
sailors
of
*NL*
old
,
they
had
run
their
boats
ashore
.
The
request
was
granted
;
and
three
*NL*
months
afterwards
,
around
the
twelve
or
fifteen
small
vessels
which
*NL*
had
brought
these
gypsies
of
the
sea
,
a
small
village
sprang
up
.
This
*NL*
village
,
constructed
in
a
singular
and
picturesque
manner
,
half
Moorish
,
*NL*
half
Spanish
,
still
remains
,
and
is
inhabited
by
descendants
of
the
*NL*
first
comers
,
who
speak
the
language
of
their
fathers
.
For
three
or
four
*NL*
centuries
they
have
remained
upon
this
small
promontory
,
on
which
*NL*
they
had
settled
like
a
flight
of
seabirds
,
without
mixing
with
the
*NL*
Marseillaise
population
,
intermarrying
,
and
preserving
their
original
*NL*
customs
and
the
costume
of
their
mother-country
as
they
have
preserved
*NL*
its
language
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
readers
will
follow
us
along
the
only
street
of
this
little
village
,
*NL*
and
enter
with
us
one
of
the
houses
,
which
is
sunburned
to
the
beautiful
*NL*
dead-leaf
color
peculiar
to
the
buildings
of
the
country
,
and
within
*NL*
coated
with
whitewash
,
like
a
Spanish
posada
.
A
young
and
beautiful
*NL*
girl
,
with
hair
as
black
as
jet
,
her
eyes
as
velvety
as
the
gazelle
's
,
*NL*
was
leaning
with
her
back
against
the
wainscot
,
rubbing
in
her
slender
*NL*
delicately
moulded
fingers
a
bunch
of
heath
blossoms
,
the
flowers
of
*NL*
which
she
was
picking
off
and
strewing
on
the
floor
;
her
arms
,
bare
to
*NL*
the
elbow
,
brown
,
and
modelled
after
those
of
the
Arlesian
Venus
,
moved
*NL*
with
a
kind
of
restless
impatience
,
and
she
tapped
the
earth
with
her
*NL*
arched
and
supple
foot
,
so
as
to
display
the
pure
and
full
shape
of
her
*NL*
well-turned
leg
,
in
its
red
cotton
,
gray
and
blue
clocked
,
stocking
.
At
*NL*
three
paces
from
her
,
seated
in
a
chair
which
he
balanced
on
two
legs
,
*NL*
leaning
his
elbow
on
an
old
worm-eaten
table
,
was
a
tall
young
man
of
*NL*
twenty
,
or
two-and-twenty
,
who
was
looking
at
her
with
an
air
in
which
*NL*
vexation
and
uneasiness
were
mingled
.
He
questioned
her
with
his
eyes
,
*NL*
but
the
firm
and
steady
gaze
of
the
young
girl
controlled
his
look
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
Mercedes
,
''
said
the
young
man
,
``
here
is
Easter
come
round
*NL*
again
;
tell
me
,
is
this
the
moment
for
a
wedding
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
answered
you
a
hundred
times
,
Fernand
,
and
really
you
must
be
*NL*
very
stupid
to
ask
me
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
repeat
it
,
--
repeat
it
,
I
beg
of
you
,
that
I
may
at
last
believe
*NL*
it
!
Tell
me
for
the
hundredth
time
that
you
refuse
my
love
,
which
had
*NL*
your
mother
's
sanction
.
Make
me
understand
once
for
all
that
you
are
*NL*
trifling
with
my
happiness
,
that
my
life
or
death
are
nothing
to
you

*NL*
Ah
,
to
have
dreamed
for
ten
years
of
being
your
husband
,
Mercedes
,
and
*NL*
to
lose
that
hope
,
which
was
the
only
stay
of
my
existence
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
At
least
it
was
not
I
who
ever
encouraged
you
in
that
hope

Fernand

*NL*
replied
Mercedes
;
``
you
can
not
reproach
me
with
the
slightest
coquetry
.
*NL*
I
have
always
said
to
you
,
'
I
love
you
as
a
brother
;
but
do
not
ask
from
*NL*
me
more
than
sisterly
affection
,
for
my
heart
is
another
's
.
'
Is
not
this
*NL*
true
,
Fernand
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
that
is
very
true
,
Mercedes
,
''
replied
the
young
man
,
``
Yes
,
you
*NL*
have
been
cruelly
frank
with
me
;
but
do
you
forget
that
it
is
among
the
*NL*
Catalans
a
sacred
law
to
intermarry
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
mistake
,
Fernand
;
it
is
not
a
law
,
but
merely
a
custom
,
and
,
I
pray
*NL*
of
you
,
do
not
cite
this
custom
in
your
favor
.
You
are
included
in
the
*NL*
conscription
,
Fernand
,
and
are
only
at
liberty
on
sufferance
,
liable
at
*NL*
any
moment
to
be
called
upon
to
take
up
arms
.
Once
a
soldier
,
what
would
*NL*
you
do
with
me
,
a
poor
orphan
,
forlorn
,
without
fortune
,
with
nothing
*NL*
but
a
half-ruined
hut
and
a
few
ragged
nets
,
the
miserable
inheritance
*NL*
left
by
my
father
to
my
mother
,
and
by
my
mother
to
me
?
She
has
been
*NL*
dead
a
year
,
and
you
know
,
Fernand
,
I
have
subsisted
almost
entirely
on
*NL*
public
charity
.
Sometimes
you
pretend
I
am
useful
to
you
,
and
that
is
*NL*
an
excuse
to
share
with
me
the
produce
of
your
fishing
,
and
I
accept
it
,
*NL*
Fernand
,
because
you
are
the
son
of
my
father
's
brother
,
because
we
were
*NL*
brought
up
together
,
and
still
more
because
it
would
give
you
so
much
*NL*
pain
if
I
refuse
.
But
I
feel
very
deeply
that
this
fish
which
I
go
and
*NL*
sell
,
and
with
the
produce
of
which
I
buy
the
flax
I
spin
,
--
I
feel
very
*NL*
keenly
,
Fernand
,
that
this
is
charity
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
if
it
were
,
Mercedes

poor
and
lone
as
you
are

you
suit
me
as
*NL*
well
as
the
daughter
of
the
first
shipowner
or
the
richest
banker
*NL*
of
Marseilles
!
What
do
such
as
we
desire
but
a
good
wife
and
careful
*NL*
housekeeper

where
can
I
look
for
these
better
than
in
you

*NL*
*NL*

Fernand

answered
Mercedes

shaking
her
head

she
loves
another
man
better

Rest
content

I
say
once
more

I
would
tempt
fortune

you
would
bring
me
good
luck

I
should

become
rich

I
could
extend
my
occupation

Catalans
it
is
because
there

no
war

remain

harsh

cruel

are
expecting
some
one
who
is
thus
attired
;
but
perhaps
he
whom
you
*NL*
await

inconstant

if
he

the
sea
is
so
to
him

The
young

made
a
gesture
of
rage

I
understand

,
and
then
,
suddenly
stopping
*NL*
before
Mercedes
,
with
his
eyes
glowing
and
his
hands
clinched
,
--
``
Say
,
*NL*
Mercedes
,
''
he
said
,
``
once
for
all
,
is
this
your
final
determination
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
love
Edmond
Dantes
,
''
the
young
girl
calmly
replied
,
``
and
none
but
*NL*
Edmond
shall
ever
be
my
husband
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
will
always
love
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
long
as
I
live
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fernand
let
fall
his
head
like
a
defeated
man
,
heaved
a
sigh
that
was
*NL*
like
a
groan
,
and
then
suddenly
looking
her
full
in
the
face
,
with
*NL*
clinched
teeth
and
expanded
nostrils
,
said
,
--
``
But
if
he
is
dead
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
he
is
dead
,
I
shall
die
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
he
has
forgotten
you
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mercedes
!
''
called
a
joyous
voice
from
without
,
--
``
Mercedes
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
exclaimed
the
young
girl
,
blushing
with
delight
,
and
fairly
*NL*
leaping
in
excess
of
love
,
``
you
see
he
has
not
forgotten
me
,
for
here
he
*NL*
is
!
''
And
rushing
towards
the
door
,
she
opened
it
,
saying
,
``
Here
,
Edmond
,
*NL*
here
I
am
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fernand
,
pale
and
trembling
,
drew
back
,
like
a
traveller
at
the
sight
*NL*
of
a
serpent
,
and
fell
into
a
chair
beside
him
.
Edmond
and
Mercedes
were
*NL*
clasped
in
each
other
's
arms
.
The
burning
Marseilles
sun
,
which
shot
*NL*
into
the
room
through
the
open
door
,
covered
them
with
a
flood
of
light
.
*NL*
At
first
they
saw
nothing
around
them
.
Their
intense
happiness
isolated
*NL*
them
from
all
the
rest
of
the
world
,
and
they
only
spoke
in
broken
*NL*
words
,
which
are
the
tokens
of
a
joy
so
extreme
that
they
seem
rather
*NL*
the
expression
of
sorrow
.
Suddenly
Edmond
saw
the
gloomy
,
pale
,
and
*NL*
threatening
countenance
of
Fernand
,
as
it
was
defined
in
the
shadow
.
*NL*
By
a
movement
for
which
he
could
scarcely
account
to
himself
,
the
young
*NL*
Catalan
placed
his
hand
on
the
knife
at
his
belt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
your
pardon
,
''
said
Dantes
,
frowning
in
his
turn
;
``
I
did
not
*NL*
perceive
that
there
were
three
of
us
.
''
Then
,
turning
to
Mercedes
,
he
*NL*
inquired
,
``
Who
is
this
gentleman
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
who
will
be
your
best
friend
,
Dantes
,
for
he
is
my
friend
,
my
*NL*
cousin
,
my
brother
;
it
is
Fernand
--
the
man
whom
,
after
you
,
Edmond
,
I
*NL*
love
the
best
in
the
world
.
Do
you
not
remember
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
!
''
said
Dantes
,
and
without
relinquishing
Mercedes
hand
clasped
in
*NL*
one
of
his
own
,
he
extended
the
other
to
the
Catalan
with
a
cordial
air
.
*NL*
But
Fernand
,
instead
of
responding
to
this
amiable
gesture
,
remained
*NL*
mute
and
trembling
.
Edmond
then
cast
his
eyes
scrutinizingly
at
the
*NL*
agitated
and
embarrassed
Mercedes
,
and
then
again
on
the
gloomy
and
*NL*
menacing
Fernand
.
This
look
told
him
all
,
and
his
anger
waxed
hot
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
not
know
,
when
I
came
with
such
haste
to
you
,
that
I
was
to
meet
*NL*
an
enemy
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
enemy
!
''
cried
Mercedes
,
with
an
angry
look
at
her
cousin
.
``
An
enemy
*NL*
in
my
house
,
do
you
say
,
Edmond
!
If
I
believed
that
,
I
would
place
my
*NL*
arm
under
yours
and
go
with
you
to
Marseilles
,
leaving
the
house
to
*NL*
return
to
it
no
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fernand
's
eye
darted
lightning
.
``
And
should
any
misfortune
occur
to
*NL*
you
,
dear
Edmond
,
''
she
continued
with
the
same
calmness
which
proved
to
*NL*
Fernand
that
the
young
girl
had
read
the
very
innermost
depths
of
his
*NL*
sinister
thought
,
``
if
misfortune
should
occur
to
you
,
I
would
ascend
the
*NL*
highest
point
of
the
Cape
de
Morgion
and
cast
myself
headlong
from
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fernand
became
deadly
pale
.
``
But
you
are
deceived
,
Edmond
,
''
she
*NL*
continued
.
``
You
have
no
enemy
here
--
there
is
no
one
but
Fernand
,
my
*NL*
brother
,
who
will
grasp
your
hand
as
a
devoted
friend
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
at
these
words
the
young
girl
fixed
her
imperious
look
on
the
*NL*
Catalan
,
who
,
as
if
fascinated
by
it
,
came
slowly
towards
Edmond
,
and
*NL*
offered
him
his
hand
.
His
hatred
,
like
a
powerless
though
furious
wave
,
*NL*
was
broken
against
the
strong
ascendancy
which
Mercedes
exercised
over
*NL*
him
.
Scarcely
,
however
,
had
he
touched
Edmond
's
hand
than
he
felt
he
had
*NL*
done
all
he
could
do
,
and
rushed
hastily
out
of
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
he
exclaimed
,
running
furiously
and
tearing
his
hair
--
``
Oh
,
who
*NL*
will
deliver
me
from
this
man
?
Wretched
--
wretched
that
I
am
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hallo
,
Catalan
!
Hallo
,
Fernand
!
where
are
you
running
to
?
''
exclaimed
a
*NL*
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
stopped
suddenly
,
looked
around
him
,
and
perceived
*NL*
Caderousse
sitting
at
table
with
Danglars
,
under
an
arbor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
''
,
said
Caderousse
,
``
why
do
n't
you
come
?
Are
you
really
in
such
a
*NL*
hurry
that
you
have
no
time
to
pass
the
time
of
day
with
your
friends
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Particularly
when
they
have
still
a
full
bottle
before
them
,
''
added
*NL*
Danglars
.
Fernand
looked
at
them
both
with
a
stupefied
air
,
but
did
not
*NL*
say
a
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
seems
besotted
,
''
said
Danglars
,
pushing
Caderousse
with
his
knee
.
*NL*
``
Are
we
mistaken
,
and
is
Dantes
triumphant
in
spite
of
all
we
have
*NL*
believed
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
we
must
inquire
into
that
,
''
was
Caderousse
's
reply
;
and
turning
*NL*
towards
the
young
man
,
said
,
``
Well
,
Catalan
,
ca
n't
you
make
up
your
*NL*
mind
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fernand
wiped
away
the
perspiration
steaming
from
his
brow
,
and
slowly
*NL*
entered
the
arbor
,
whose
shade
seemed
to
restore
somewhat
of
calmness
to
*NL*
his
senses
,
and
whose
coolness
somewhat
of
refreshment
to
his
exhausted
*NL*
body
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-day
,
''
said
he
.
``
You
called
me
,
did
n't
you
?
''
And
he
fell
,
rather
*NL*
than
sat
down
,
on
one
of
the
seats
which
surrounded
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
called
you
because
you
were
running
like
a
madman
,
and
I
was
afraid
*NL*
you
would
throw
yourself
into
the
sea
,
''
said
Caderousse
,
laughing
.
``
Why
,
*NL*
when
a
man
has
friends
,
they
are
not
only
to
offer
him
a
glass
of
wine
,
*NL*
but
,
moreover
,
to
prevent
his
swallowing
three
or
four
pints
of
water
*NL*
unnecessarily
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fernand
gave
a
groan
,
which
resembled
a
sob
,
and
dropped
his
head
into
*NL*
his
hands
,
his
elbows
leaning
on
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Fernand
,
I
must
say
,
''
said
Caderousse
,
beginning
the
*NL*
conversation
,
with
that
brutality
of
the
common
people
in
which
*NL*
curiosity
destroys
all
diplomacy
,
``
you
look
uncommonly
like
a
rejected
*NL*
lover
;
''
and
he
burst
into
a
hoarse
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bah
!
''
said
Danglars
,
``
a
lad
of
his
make
was
not
born
to
be
unhappy
in
*NL*
love
.
You
are
laughing
at
him
,
Caderousse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
he
replied
,
``
only
hark
how
he
sighs
!
Come
,
come
,
Fernand
,
''
said
*NL*
Caderousse
,
``
hold
up
your
head
,
and
answer
us
.
It
's
not
polite
not
to
*NL*
reply
to
friends
who
ask
news
of
your
health
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
health
is
well
enough
,
''
said
Fernand
,
clinching
his
hands
without
*NL*
raising
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
you
see
,
Danglars
,
''
said
Caderousse
,
winking
at
his
friend
,
``
this
*NL*
is
how
it
is
;
Fernand
,
whom
you
see
here
,
is
a
good
and
brave
Catalan
,
*NL*
one
of
the
best
fishermen
in
Marseilles
,
and
he
is
in
love
with
a
very
*NL*
fine
girl
,
named
Mercedes
;
but
it
appears
,
unfortunately
,
that
the
fine
*NL*
girl
is
in
love
with
the
mate
of
the
Pharaon
;
and
as
the
Pharaon
arrived
*NL*
to-day
--
why
,
you
understand
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
I
do
not
understand
,
''
said
Danglars
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
Fernand
has
been
dismissed
,
''
continued
Caderousse
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
and
what
then
?
''
said
Fernand
,
lifting
up
his
head
,
and
looking
at
*NL*
Caderousse
like
a
man
who
looks
for
some
one
on
whom
to
vent
his
anger
;
*NL*
``
Mercedes
is
not
accountable
to
any
person
,
is
she
?
Is
she
not
free
to
*NL*
love
whomsoever
she
will
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
if
you
take
it
in
that
sense
,
''
said
Caderousse
,
``
it
is
another
*NL*
thing
.
But
I
thought
you
were
a
Catalan
,
and
they
told
me
the
Catalans
*NL*
were
not
men
to
allow
themselves
to
be
supplanted
by
a
rival
.
It
was
*NL*
even
told
me
that
Fernand
,
especially
,
was
terrible
in
his
vengeance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fernand
smiled
piteously
.
``
A
lover
is
never
terrible
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
fellow
!
''
remarked
Danglars
,
affecting
to
pity
the
young
man
from
*NL*
the
bottom
of
his
heart
.
``
Why
,
you
see
,
he
did
not
expect
to
see
Dantes
*NL*
return
so
suddenly
--
he
thought
he
was
dead
,
perhaps
;
or
perchance
*NL*
faithless
!
These
things
always
come
on
us
more
severely
when
they
come
*NL*
suddenly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
ma
foi
,
under
any
circumstances
,
''
said
Caderousse
,
who
drank
as
he
*NL*
spoke
,
and
on
whom
the
fumes
of
the
wine
began
to
take
effect
,
--
``
under
*NL*
any
circumstances
Fernand
is
not
the
only
person
put
out
by
the
*NL*
fortunate
arrival
of
Dantes
;
is
he
,
Danglars
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
you
are
right
--
and
I
should
say
that
would
bring
him
ill-luck
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
never
mind
,
''
answered
Caderousse
,
pouring
out
a
glass
of
wine
*NL*
for
Fernand
,
and
filling
his
own
for
the
eighth
or
ninth
time
,
while
*NL*
Danglars
had
merely
sipped
his
.
``
Never
mind
--
in
the
meantime
he
marries
*NL*
Mercedes
--
the
lovely
Mercedes
--
at
least
he
returns
to
do
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
During
this
time
Danglars
fixed
his
piercing
glance
on
the
young
man
,
on
*NL*
whose
heart
Caderousse
's
words
fell
like
molten
lead
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
when
is
the
wedding
to
be
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it
is
not
yet
fixed
!
''
murmured
Fernand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
but
it
will
be
,
''
said
Caderousse
,
``
as
surely
as
Dantes
will
be
*NL*
captain
of
the
Pharaon
--
eh
,
Danglars
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Danglars
shuddered
at
this
unexpected
attack
,
and
turned
to
Caderousse
,
*NL*
whose
countenance
he
scrutinized
,
to
try
and
detect
whether
the
blow
*NL*
was
premeditated
;
but
he
read
nothing
but
envy
in
a
countenance
already
*NL*
rendered
brutal
and
stupid
by
drunkenness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
he
,
filling
the
glasses
,
``
let
us
drink
to
Captain
Edmond
*NL*
Dantes
,
husband
of
the
beautiful
Catalane
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Caderousse
raised
his
glass
to
his
mouth
with
unsteady
hand
,
and
*NL*
swallowed
the
contents
at
a
gulp
.
Fernand
dashed
his
on
the
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
,
eh
,
eh
!
''
stammered
Caderousse
.
``
What
do
I
see
down
there
by
the
*NL*
wall
,
in
the
direction
of
the
Catalans
?
Look
,
Fernand
,
your
eyes
are
*NL*
better
than
mine
.
I
believe
I
see
double
.
You
know
wine
is
a
deceiver
;
*NL*
but
I
should
say
it
was
two
lovers
walking
side
by
side
,
and
hand
in
*NL*
hand
.
Heaven
forgive
me
,
they
do
not
know
that
we
can
see
them
,
and
they
*NL*
are
actually
embracing
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Danglars
did
not
lose
one
pang
that
Fernand
endured
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
them
,
Fernand
?
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
was
the
reply
,
in
a
low
voice
.
``
It
is
Edmond
and
Mercedes
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
see
there
,
now
!
''
said
Caderousse
;
``
and
I
did
not
recognize
them
!
*NL*
Hallo
,
Dantes
!
hello
,
lovely
damsel
!
Come
this
way
,
and
let
us
know
when
*NL*
the
wedding
is
to
be
,
for
Fernand
here
is
so
obstinate
he
will
not
tell
*NL*
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hold
your
tongue
,
will
you
?
''
said
Danglars
,
pretending
to
restrain
*NL*
Caderousse
,
who
,
with
the
tenacity
of
drunkards
,
leaned
out
of
the
*NL*
arbor
.
``
Try
to
stand
upright
,
and
let
the
lovers
make
love
without
*NL*
interruption
.
See
,
look
at
Fernand
,
and
follow
his
example
;
he
is
*NL*
well-behaved
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fernand
,
probably
excited
beyond
bearing
,
pricked
by
Danglars
,
as
the
*NL*
bull
is
by
the
bandilleros
,
was
about
to
rush
out
;
for
he
had
risen
from
*NL*
his
seat
,
and
seemed
to
be
collecting
himself
to
dash
headlong
upon
his
*NL*
rival
,
when
Mercedes
,
smiling
and
graceful
,
lifted
up
her
lovely
head
,
*NL*
and
looked
at
them
with
her
clear
and
bright
eyes
.
At
this
Fernand
*NL*
recollected
her
threat
of
dying
if
Edmond
died
,
and
dropped
again
*NL*
heavily
on
his
seat
.
Danglars
looked
at
the
two
men
,
one
after
the
*NL*
other
,
the
one
brutalized
by
liquor
,
the
other
overwhelmed
with
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
get
nothing
from
these
fools
,
''
he
muttered
;
``
and
I
am
very
much
*NL*
afraid
of
being
here
between
a
drunkard
and
a
coward
.
Here
's
an
envious
*NL*
fellow
making
himself
boozy
on
wine
when
he
ought
to
be
nursing
his
*NL*
wrath
,
and
here
is
a
fool
who
sees
the
woman
he
loves
stolen
from
under
*NL*
his
nose
and
takes
on
like
a
big
baby
.
Yet
this
Catalan
has
eyes
that
*NL*
glisten
like
those
of
the
vengeful
Spaniards
,
Sicilians
,
and
Calabrians
,
*NL*
and
the
other
has
fists
big
enough
to
crush
an
ox
at
one
blow
.
*NL*
Unquestionably
,
Edmond
's
star
is
in
the
ascendant
,
and
he
will
marry
the
*NL*
splendid
girl
--
he
will
be
captain
,
too
,
and
laugh
at
us
all
,
unless
''
--
a
*NL*
sinister
smile
passed
over
Danglars
'
lips
--
``
unless
I
take
a
hand
in
the
*NL*
affair
,
''
he
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hallo
!
''
continued
Caderousse
,
half-rising
,
and
with
his
fist
on
the
*NL*
table
,
``
hallo
,
Edmond
!
do
you
not
see
your

you

proud

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

replied
Dantes
,
``
I

I

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

very
well

said
Caderousse
.
``
How
do
you
do

Dantes

*NL*
*NL*
Mercedes
courtesied
gravely
,
and
said

bowing
to

Fernand
opened

*NL*
*NL*
Danglars
followed
Edmond
and
Mercedes
with
his
eyes
until
the
two
lovers
*NL*
disappeared
behind
one
of
the
angles
of
Fort
Saint
Nicolas
,
then
turning
*NL*
round
,
he
perceived
Fernand

who
had
fallen
,
pale
and
trembling
,
into
*NL*
his
chair
,
while
Caderousse
stammered
out
the
words
of
a
drinking-song

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

n't
have
him
killed
--
I
wo
n't
!
He
's
my
*NL*
friend
,
and
this
morning
offered
to
share
his
money
with
me
,
as
I
shared
*NL*
mine
with
him
.
I
wo
n't
have
Dantes
killed
--
I
wo
n't
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
who
has
said
a
word
about
killing
him
,
muddlehead
?
''
replied
*NL*
Danglars
.
``
We
were
merely
joking
;
drink
to
his
health
,
''
he
added
,
*NL*
filling
Caderousse
's
glass
,
``
and
do
not
interfere
with
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
Dantes
'
good
health
!
''
said
Caderousse
,
emptying
his
glass
,
*NL*
``
here
's
to
his
health
!
his
health
--
hurrah
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
the
means
--
the
means
?
''
said
Fernand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
not
hit
upon
any
?
''
asked
Danglars
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
!
--
you
undertook
to
do
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
True
,
''
replied
Danglars
;
``
the
French
have
the
superiority
over
the
*NL*
Spaniards
,
that
the
Spaniards
ruminate
,
while
the
French
invent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
invent
,
then
,
''
said
Fernand
impatiently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Waiter
,
''
said
Danglars
,
``
pen
,
ink
,
and
paper
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pen
,
ink
,
and
paper
,
''
muttered
Fernand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
I
am
a
supercargo
;
pen
,
ink
,
and
paper
are
my
tools
,
and
without
*NL*
my
tools
I
am
fit
for
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pen
,
ink
,
and
paper
,
then
,
''
called
Fernand
loudly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
what
you
want
on
that
table
,
''
said
the
waiter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bring
them
here
.
''
The
waiter
did
as
he
was
desired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
one
thinks
,
''
said
Caderousse
,
letting
his
hand
drop
on
the
paper
,
*NL*
``
there
is
here
wherewithal
to
kill
a
man
more
sure
than
if
we
waited
at
*NL*
the
corner
of
a
wood
to
assassinate
him
!
I
have
always
had
more
dread
*NL*
of
a
pen
,
a
bottle
of
ink
,
and
a
sheet
of
paper
,
than
of
a
sword
or
*NL*
pistol
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
fellow
is
not
so
drunk
as
he
appears
to
be
,
''
said
Danglars
.
``
Give
*NL*
him
some
more
wine
,
Fernand
.
''
Fernand
filled
Caderousse
's
glass
,
who
,
*NL*
like
the
confirmed
toper
he
was
,
lifted
his
hand
from
the
paper
and
*NL*
seized
the
glass
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Catalan
watched
him
until
Caderousse
,
almost
overcome
by
this
fresh
*NL*
assault
on
his
senses
,
rested
,
or
rather
dropped
,
his
glass
upon
the
*NL*
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
''
resumed
the
Catalan
,
as
he
saw
the
final
glimmer
of
Caderousse
's
*NL*
reason
vanishing
before
the
last
glass
of
wine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
I
should
say
,
for
instance
,
''
resumed
Danglars
,
``
that
if
*NL*
after
a
voyage
such
as
Dantes
has
just
made
,
in
which
he
touched
at
the
*NL*
Island
of
Elba
,
some
one
were
to
denounce
him
to
the
king
's
procureur
as
*NL*
a
Bonapartist
agent
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
denounce
him
!
''
exclaimed
the
young
man
hastily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
they
will
make
you
then
sign
your
declaration
,
and
confront
*NL*
you
with
him
you
have
denounced
;
I
will
supply
you
with
the
means
of
*NL*
supporting
your
accusation
,
for
I
know
the
fact
well
.
But
Dantes
can
not
*NL*
remain
forever
in
prison
,
and
one
day
or
other
he
will
leave
it
,
and
*NL*
the
day
when
he
comes
out
,
woe
betide
him
who
was
the
cause
of
his
*NL*
incarceration
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
should
wish
nothing
better

that

would
come
and
seek
a
*NL*
quarrel
with
me

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
and
Mercedes
!
Mercedes
,
who
will
detest
you
if
you
have
only
the
*NL*
misfortune
to
scratch
the
skin
of
her
dearly
beloved
Edmond

*NL*
*NL*
``
True
!
''
said
Fernand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

no
,
''
continued
Danglars
;
``
if
we
resolve
on
such
a
step
,
it
would
*NL*
be
much
better
to
take
,
as
I
now
do
,
this
pen
,
dip
it
into
this
ink
,
and
*NL*
write
with
the
left
hand
-LRB-
that
the
writing
may
not
be
recognized
-RRB-
the
*NL*
denunciation
we
propose
.
''
And
Danglars
,
uniting
practice
with
theory
,
*NL*
wrote
with
his
left
hand
,
and
in
a
writing
reversed
from
his
usual
*NL*
style
,
and
totally
unlike
it
,
the
following
lines
,
which
he
handed
to
*NL*
Fernand
,
and
which
Fernand
read
in
an
undertone
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
honorable
,
the
king
's
attorney
,
is
informed
by
a
friend
of
the
*NL*
throne
and
religion
,
that
one
Edmond
Dantes
,
mate
of
the
ship
Pharaon
,
*NL*
arrived
this
morning
from
Smyrna
,
after
having
touched
at
Naples
*NL*
and
Porto-Ferrajo
,
has
been
intrusted
by
Murat
with
a
letter
for
the
*NL*
usurper
,
and
by
the
usurper
with
a
letter
for
the
Bonapartist
committee
*NL*
in
Paris
.
Proof
of
this
crime
will
be
found
on
arresting
him
,
for
the
*NL*
letter
will
be
found
upon
him
,
or
at
his
father
's
,
or
in
his
cabin
on
*NL*
board
the
Pharaon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
good
,
''
resumed
Danglars
;
``
now
your
revenge
looks
like
*NL*
common-sense
,
for
in
no
way
can
it
revert
to
yourself
,
and
the
matter
*NL*
will
thus
work
its
own
way
;
there
is
nothing
to
do
now
but
fold
the
*NL*
letter
as
I
am
doing
,
and
write
upon
it
,
`
To
the
king
's
attorney
,
'
and
*NL*
that
's
all
settled

''
And
Danglars
wrote
the
address
as
he
spoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
and
that
's
all
settled
!
''
exclaimed
Caderousse
,
who
,
by
a
last
*NL*
effort
of
intellect
,
had
followed
the
reading
of
the
letter
,
and
*NL*
instinctively
comprehended
all
the
misery
which
such
a
denunciation
*NL*
must
entail
.
``
Yes
,
and
that
's
all
settled
;
only
it
will
be
an
infamous
*NL*
shame
;
''
and
he
stretched
out
his
hand
to
reach
the
letter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Danglars
,
taking
it
from
beyond
his
reach
;
``
and
as
what
I
*NL*
say
and
do
is
merely
in
jest
,
and
I
,
amongst
the
first
and
foremost
,
*NL*
should
be
sorry
if
anything
happened
to
Dantes
--
the
worthy
Dantes
--
look
*NL*
here
!
''
And
taking
the
letter
,
he
squeezed
it
up
in
his
hands
and
threw
*NL*
it
into
a
corner
of
the
arbor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
!
''
said
Caderousse
.
``
Dantes
is
my
friend
,
and
I
wo
n't
have
him
*NL*
ill-used
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
who
thinks
of
using
him
ill
?
Certainly
neither
I
nor
Fernand

''
*NL*
said
Danglars
,
rising
and
looking
at
the
young
man
,
who
still
remained
*NL*
seated
,
but
whose
eye
was
fixed
on
the
denunciatory
sheet
of
paper
flung
*NL*
into
the
corner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
this
case
,
''
replied
Caderousse
,
``
let
's
have
some
more
wine

I
wish

health

Mercedes

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
had
too
much
already

said
Danglars
;
``

if

you
will
be

sleep
here

because
unable
to
stand

on
your
legs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
?
''
said
Caderousse
,
rising
with
all
the
offended
dignity
of
a
drunken
*NL*
man
,
``
I
ca
n't
keep
on
my
legs
?
Why
,
I
'll
wager
I
can
go
up
into
the
*NL*
belfry
of
the
Accoules
,
and
without
staggering
,
too
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Done

said
Danglars
,
``
I
'll
take
your
bet

to-morrow

to-day
it
is
*NL*
time
to
return

me
your
arm

and
let
us
go

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
let
us
go

''
said
Caderousse
;
``
but
I
do
n't
want
your

at
*NL*
all

Come

Fernand
,
wo
n't
you
return
to
Marseilles
with
us
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

''
said
Fernand
;
``
I
shall
return
to
the
Catalans

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
wrong

Come

*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``

Danglars

and
let

*NL*
young
gentleman
return

the
Catalans
if
he
chooses

''
*NL*
*NL*
Danglars
took
advantage
of
Caderousse
's
temper
at
the
moment
,
to
take
*NL*
him
off
towards
Marseilles
by
the
Porte
Saint-Victor
,
staggering
as
he
*NL*
went
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
had
advanced
about
twenty
yards
,
Danglars
looked
back
and
*NL*
saw
Fernand
stoop
,
pick
up
the
crumpled
paper
,
and
putting
it
into
his
*NL*
pocket
then
rush
out
of
the
arbor
towards
Pillon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Caderousse
,
``
why
,
what
a
lie
he
told

He
said

going

is
going
to

city

Hallo

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

do

Danglars

gone

*NL*
*NL*
``

Caderousse

Chapter
5
.
The
Marriage-Feast
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
morning
's
sun
rose
clear
and
resplendent
,
touching
the
foamy
waves
*NL*
into
a
network
of
ruby-tinted
light
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
feast
had
been
made
ready
on
the
second
floor
at
La
Reserve
,
with
*NL*
whose
arbor
the
reader
is
already
familiar
.
The
apartment
destined
for
*NL*
the
purpose
was
spacious
and
lighted
by
a
number
of
windows
,
over
each
*NL*
of
which
was
written
in
golden
letters
for
some
inexplicable
reason
the
*NL*
name
of
one
of
the
principal
cities
of
France
;
beneath
these
windows
a
*NL*
wooden
balcony
extended
the
entire
length
of
the
house
.
And
although
*NL*
the
entertainment
was
fixed
for
twelve
o'clock
,
an
hour
previous
to
*NL*
that
time
the
balcony
was
filled
with
impatient
and
expectant
guests
,
*NL*
consisting
of
the
favored
part
of
the
crew
of
the
Pharaon
,
and
other
*NL*
personal
friends
of
the
bride-groom
,
the
whole
of
whom
had
arrayed
*NL*
themselves
in
their
choicest
costumes
,
in
order
to
do
greater
honor
to
*NL*
the
occasion
.
*NL*
*NL*
Various
rumors
were
afloat
to
the
effect
that
the
owners
of
the
Pharaon
*NL*
had
promised
to
attend
the
nuptial
feast
;
but
all
seemed
unanimous
in
*NL*
doubting
that
an
act
of
such
rare
and
exceeding
condescension
could
*NL*
possibly
be
intended
.
*NL*
*NL*
Danglars
,
however
,
who
now
made
his
appearance
,
accompanied
by
*NL*
Caderousse
,
effectually
confirmed
the
report
,
stating
that
he
had
*NL*
recently
conversed
with
M.
Morrel
,
who
had
himself
assured
him
of
his
*NL*
intention
to
dine
at
La
Reserve
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
fact
,
a
moment
later
M.
Morrel
appeared
and
was
saluted
with
an
*NL*
enthusiastic
burst
of
applause
from
the
crew
of
the
Pharaon
,
who
hailed
*NL*
the
visit
of
the
shipowner
as
a
sure
indication
that
the
man
whose
*NL*
wedding
feast
he
thus
delighted
to
honor
would
ere
long
be
first
in
*NL*
command
of
the
ship
;
and
as
Dantes
was
universally
beloved
on
board
his
*NL*
vessel
,
the
sailors
put
no
restraint
on
their
tumultuous
joy
at
finding
*NL*
that
the
opinion
and
choice
of
their
superiors
so
exactly
coincided
with
*NL*
their
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
the
entrance
of
M.
Morrel
,
Danglars
and
Caderousse
were
despatched
*NL*
in
search
of
the
bride-groom
to
convey
to
him
the
intelligence
of
the
*NL*
arrival
of
the
important
personage
whose
coming
had
created
such
a
*NL*
lively
sensation
,
and
to
beseech
him
to
make
haste
.
*NL*
*NL*
Danglars
and
Caderousse
set
off
upon
their
errand
at
full
speed
;
but
ere
*NL*
they
had
gone
many
steps
they
perceived
a
group
advancing
towards
them
,
*NL*
composed
of
the
betrothed
pair
,
a
party
of
young
girls
in
attendance
on
*NL*
the
bride
,
by
whose
side
walked
Dantes
'
father
;
the
whole
brought
up
by
*NL*
Fernand
,
whose
lips
wore
their
usual
sinister
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
Neither
Mercedes
nor
Edmond
observed
the
strange
expression
of
his
*NL*
countenance
;
they
were
so
happy
that
they
were
conscious
only
of
the
*NL*
sunshine
and
the
presence
of
each
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
acquitted
themselves
of
their
errand
,
and
exchanged
a
hearty
*NL*
shake
of
the
hand
with
Edmond
,
Danglars
and
Caderousse
took
their
places
*NL*
beside
Fernand
and
old
Dantes
,
--
the
latter
of
whom
attracted
universal
*NL*
notice
.
The
old
man
was
attired
in
a
suit
of
glistening
watered
silk
,
*NL*
trimmed
with
steel
buttons
,
beautifully
cut
and
polished
.
His
thin
*NL*
but
wiry
legs
were
arrayed
in
a
pair
of
richly
embroidered
clocked
*NL*
stockings
,
evidently
of
English
manufacture
,
while
from
his
*NL*
three-cornered
hat
depended
a
long
streaming
knot
of
white
and
blue
*NL*
ribbons
.
Thus
he
came
along
,
supporting
himself
on
a
curiously
carved
*NL*
stick
,
his
aged
countenance
lit
up
with
happiness
,
looking
for
all
the
*NL*
world
like
one
of
the
aged
dandies
of
1796
,
parading
the
newly
opened
*NL*
gardens
of
the
Tuileries
and
Luxembourg
.
Beside
him
glided
Caderousse
,
*NL*
whose
desire
to
partake
of
the
good
things
provided
for
the
*NL*
wedding-party
had
induced
him
to
become
reconciled
to
the
Dantes
,
father
*NL*
and
son
,
although
there
still
lingered
in
his
mind
a
faint
and
unperfect
*NL*
recollection
of
the
events
of
the
preceding
night
;
just
as
the
brain
*NL*
retains
on
waking
in
the
morning
the
dim
and
misty
outline
of
a
dream
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
Danglars
approached
the
disappointed
lover
,
he
cast
on
him
a
look
of
*NL*
deep
meaning
,
while
Fernand
,
as
he
slowly
paced
behind
the
happy
pair
,
*NL*
who
seemed
,
in
their
own
unmixed
content
,
to
have
entirely
forgotten
*NL*
that
such
a
being
as
himself
existed
,
was
pale
and
abstracted
;
*NL*
occasionally
,
however
,
a
deep
flush
would
overspread
his
countenance
,
*NL*
and
a
nervous
contraction
distort
his
features
,
while
,
with
an
agitated
*NL*
and
restless
gaze
,
he
would
glance
in
the
direction
of
Marseilles
,
like
*NL*
one
who
either
anticipated
or
foresaw
some
great
and
important
event
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dantes
himself
was
simply
,
but
becomingly
,
clad
in
the
dress
peculiar
to
*NL*
the
merchant
service
--
a
costume
somewhat
between
a
military
and
a
civil
*NL*
garb
;
and
with
his
fine
countenance
,
radiant
with
joy
and
happiness
,
a
*NL*
more
perfect
specimen
of
manly
beauty
could
scarcely
be
imagined
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lovely
as
the
Greek
girls
of
Cyprus
or
Chios
,
Mercedes
boasted
the
same
*NL*
bright
flashing
eyes
of
jet
,
and
ripe
,
round
,
coral
lips
.
She
moved
*NL*
with
the
light
,
free
step
of
an
Arlesienne
or
an
Andalusian
.
One
more
*NL*
practiced
in
the
arts
of
great
cities
would
have
hid
her
blushes
beneath
*NL*
a
veil
,
or
,
at
least
,
have
cast
down
her
thickly
fringed
lashes
,
so
as
*NL*
to
have
concealed
the
liquid
lustre
of
her
animated
eyes
;
but
,
on
the
*NL*
contrary
,
the
delighted
girl
looked
around
her
with
a
smile
that
seemed
*NL*
to
say
:
``
If
you
are
my
friends
,
rejoice
with
me
,
for
I
am
very
happy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
the
bridal
party
came
in
sight
of
La
Reserve
,
M.
Morrel
*NL*
descended
and
came
forth
to
meet
it
,
followed
by
the
soldiers
and
*NL*
sailors
there
assembled
,
to
whom
he
had
repeated
the
promise
already
*NL*
given
,
that
Dantes
should
be
the
successor
to
the
late
Captain
Leclere
.
*NL*
Edmond
,
at
the
approach
of
his
patron
,
respectfully
placed
the
arm
of
*NL*
his
affianced
bride
within
that
of
M.
Morrel
,
who
,
forthwith
conducting
*NL*
her
up
the
flight
of
wooden
steps
leading
to
the
chamber
in
which
the
*NL*
feast
was
prepared
,
was
gayly
followed
by
the
guests
,
beneath
whose
*NL*
heavy
tread
the
slight
structure
creaked
and
groaned
for
the
space
of
*NL*
several
minutes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Father
,
''
said
Mercedes
,
stopping
when
she
had
reached
the
centre
of
the
*NL*
table
,
``
sit
,
I
pray
you
,
on
my
right
hand
;
on
my
left
I
will
place
him
*NL*
who
has
ever
been
as
a
brother
to
me
,
''
pointing
with
a
soft
and
gentle
*NL*
smile
to
Fernand
;
but
her
words
and
look
seemed
to
inflict
the
direst
*NL*
torture
on
him
,
for
his
lips
became
ghastly
pale
,
and
even
beneath
the
*NL*
dark
hue
of
his
complexion
the
blood
might
be
seen
retreating
as
though
*NL*
some
sudden
pang
drove
it
back
to
the
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
this
time
,
Dantes
,
at
the
opposite
side
of
the
table
,
had
been
*NL*
occupied
in
similarly
placing
his
most
honored
guests
.
M.
Morrel
was
*NL*
seated
at
his
right
hand
,
Danglars
at
his
left
;
while
,
at
a
sign
from
*NL*
Edmond
,
the
rest
of
the
company
ranged
themselves
as
they
found
it
most
*NL*
agreeable
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
they
began
to
pass
around
the
dusky
,
piquant
,
Arlesian
sausages
,
*NL*
and
lobsters
in
their
dazzling
red
cuirasses
,
prawns
of
large
size
and
*NL*
brilliant
color
,
the
echinus
with
its
prickly
outside
and
dainty
morsel
*NL*
within
,
the
clovis
,
esteemed
by
the
epicures
of
the
South
as
more
than
*NL*
rivalling
the
exquisite
flavor
of
the
oyster
,
--
all
the
delicacies
,
in
*NL*
fact
,
that
are
cast
up
by
the
wash
of
waters
on
the
sandy
beach
,
and
*NL*
styled
by
the
grateful
fishermen
``
fruits
of
the
sea
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
pretty
silence
truly
!
''
said
the
old
father
of
the
bride-groom
,
as
*NL*
he
carried
to
his
lips
a
glass
of
wine
of
the
hue
and
brightness
of
the
*NL*
topaz
,
and
which
had
just
been
placed
before
Mercedes
herself
.
``
Now
,
*NL*
would
anybody
think
that
this
room
contained
a
happy
,
merry
party
,
who
*NL*
desire
nothing
better
than
to
laugh
and
dance
the
hours
away
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
sighed
Caderousse
,
``
a
man
can
not
always
feel
happy
because
he
is
*NL*
about
to
be
married
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
truth
is
,
''
replied
Dantes
,
``
that
I
am
too
happy
for
noisy
mirth
;
*NL*
if
that
is
what
you
meant
by
your
observation
,
my
worthy
friend
,
you
*NL*
are
right
;
joy
takes
a
strange
effect
at
times
,
it
seems
to
oppress
us
*NL*
almost
the
same
as
sorrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Danglars
looked
towards
Fernand
,
whose
excitable
nature
received
and
*NL*
betrayed
each
fresh
impression
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
what
ails
you
?
''
asked
he
of
Edmond
.
``
Do
you
fear
any
approaching
*NL*
evil
?
I
should
say
that
you
were
the
happiest
man
alive
at
this
*NL*
instant
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
that
is
the
very
thing
that
alarms
me
,
''
returned
Dantes
.
``
Man
does
*NL*
not
appear
to
me
to
be
intended
to
enjoy
felicity
so
unmixed
;
happiness
*NL*
is
like
the
enchanted
palaces
we
read
of
in
our
childhood
,
where
fierce
,
*NL*
fiery
dragons
defend
the
entrance
and
approach
;
and
monsters
of
all
*NL*
shapes
and
kinds
,
requiring
to
be
overcome
ere
victory
is
ours
.
I
own
*NL*
that
I
am
lost
in
wonder
to
find
myself
promoted
to
an
honor
of
which
I
*NL*
feel
myself
unworthy
--
that
of
being
the
husband
of
Mercedes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
nay
!
''
cried
Caderousse
,
smiling
,
``
you
have
not
attained
that
honor
*NL*
yet
.
Mercedes
is
not
yet
your
wife
.
Just
assume
the
tone
and
manner
of
*NL*
a
husband
,
and
see
how
she
will
remind
you
that
your
hour
is
not
yet
*NL*
come
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
bride
blushed
,
while
Fernand
,
restless
and
uneasy
,
seemed
to
start
*NL*
at
every
fresh
sound
,
and
from
time
to
time
wiped
away
the
large
drops
*NL*
of
perspiration
that
gathered
on
his
brow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
never
mind
that
,
neighbor
Caderousse
;
it
is
not
worth
while
to
*NL*
contradict
me
for
such
a
trifle
as
that
.
'T
is
true
that
Mercedes
is
not
*NL*
actually
my
wife
;
but
,
''
added
he
,
drawing
out
his
watch
,
``
in
an
hour
and
*NL*
a
half
she
will
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
general
exclamation
of
surprise
ran
round
the
table
,
with
the
*NL*
exception
of
the
elder
Dantes
,
whose
laugh
displayed
the
still
perfect
*NL*
beauty
of
his
large
white
teeth
.
Mercedes
looked
pleased
and
gratified
,
*NL*
while
Fernand
grasped
the
handle
of
his
knife
with
a
convulsive
clutch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
an
hour
?
''
inquired
Danglars
,
turning
pale
.
``
How
is
that
,
my
friend
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
thus
it
is
,
''
replied
Dantes
.
``
Thanks
to
the
influence
of
M.
*NL*
Morrel
,
to
whom
,
next
to
my
father
,
I
owe
every
blessing
I
enjoy
,
every
*NL*
difficulty
his
been
removed
.
We
have
purchased
permission
to
waive
the
*NL*
usual
delay
;
and
at
half-past
two
o'clock
the
mayor
of
Marseilles
will
*NL*
be
waiting
for
us
at
the
city
hall
.
Now
,
as
a
quarter-past
one
has
*NL*
already
struck
,
I
do
not
consider
I
have
asserted
too
much
in
saying
,
*NL*
that
,
in
another
hour
and
thirty
minutes
Mercedes
will
have
become
*NL*
Madame
Dantes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fernand
closed
his
eyes
,
a
burning
sensation
passed
across
his
brow
,
and
*NL*
he
was
compelled
to
support
himself
by
the
table
to
prevent
his
falling
*NL*
from
his
chair
;
but
in
spite
of
all
his
efforts
,
he
could
not
refrain
*NL*
from
uttering
a
deep
groan
,
which
,
however
,
was
lost
amid
the
noisy
*NL*
felicitations
of
the
company
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Upon
my
word
,
''
cried
the
old
man
,
``
you
make
short
work
of
this
kind
of
*NL*
affair
.
Arrived
here
only
yesterday
morning
,
and
married
to-day
at
three
*NL*
o'clock
!
Commend
me
to
a
sailor
for
going
the
quick
way
to
work
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
''
asked
Danglars
,
in
a
timid
tone
,
``
how
did
you
manage
about
the
*NL*
other
formalities
--
the
contract
--
the
settlement
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
contract
,
''
answered
Dantes
,
laughingly
,
``
it
did
n't
take
long
to
*NL*
fix
that
.
Mercedes
has
no
fortune
;
I
have
none
to
settle
on
her
.
So
,
you
*NL*
see
,
our
papers
were
quickly
written
out
,
and
certainly
do
not
come
very
*NL*
expensive
.
''
This
joke
elicited
a
fresh
burst
of
applause
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
that
what
we
presumed
to
be
merely
the
betrothal
feast
turns
out
to
*NL*
be
the
actual
wedding
dinner
!
''
said
Danglars
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
''
answered
Dantes
;
``
do
n't
imagine
I
am
going
to
put
you
off
in
*NL*
that
shabby
manner
.
To-morrow
morning
I
start
for
Paris
;
four
days
to
*NL*
go
,
and
the
same
to
return
,
with
one
day
to
discharge
the
commission
*NL*
intrusted
to
me
,
is
all
the
time
I
shall
be
absent
.
I
shall
be
back
here
*NL*
by
the
first
of
March
,
and
on
the
second
I
give
my
real
marriage
feast
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
prospect
of
fresh
festivity
redoubled
the
hilarity
of
the
guests
*NL*
to
such
a
degree
,
that
the
elder
Dantes
,
who
,
at
the
commencement
of
*NL*
the
repast
,
had
commented
upon
the
silence
that
prevailed
,
now
found
*NL*
it
difficult
,
amid
the
general
din
of
voices
,
to
obtain
a
moment
's
*NL*
tranquillity
in
which
to
drink
to
the
health
and
prosperity
of
the
bride
*NL*
and
bride-groom
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dantes
,
perceiving
the
affectionate
eagerness
of
his
father
,
responded
*NL*
by
a
look
of
grateful
pleasure
;
while
Mercedes
glanced
at
the
clock
and
*NL*
made
an
expressive
gesture
to
Edmond
.
*NL*
*NL*
Around
the
table
reigned
that
noisy
hilarity
which
usually
prevails
at
*NL*
such
a
time
among
people
sufficiently
free
from
the
demands
of
*NL*
social
position
not
to
feel
the
trammels
of
etiquette
.
Such
as
at
*NL*
the
commencement
of
the
repast
had
not
been
able
to
seat
themselves
*NL*
according
to
their
inclination
rose
unceremoniously
,
and
sought
out
more
*NL*
agreeable
companions
.
Everybody
talked
at
once
,
without
waiting
for
a
*NL*
reply
and
each
one
seemed
to
be
contented
with
expressing
his
or
her
own
*NL*
thoughts
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fernand
's
paleness
appeared
to
have
communicated
itself
to
Danglars
.
*NL*
As
for
Fernand
himself
,
he
seemed
to
be
enduring
the
tortures
of
the
*NL*
damned
;
unable
to
rest
,
he
was
among
the
first
to
quit
the
table
,
*NL*
and
,
as
though
seeking
to
avoid
the
hilarious
mirth
that
rose
in
such
*NL*
deafening
sounds
,
he
continued
,
in
utter
silence
,
to
pace
the
farther
*NL*
end
of
the
salon
.
*NL*
*NL*
Caderousse
approached
him
just
as
Danglars
,
whom
Fernand
seemed
most
*NL*
anxious
to
avoid
,
had
joined
him
in
a
corner
of
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Upon
my
word
,
''
said
Caderousse
,
from
whose
mind
the
friendly
treatment
*NL*
of
Dantes
,
united
with
the
effect
of
the
excellent
wine
he
had
partaken
*NL*
of
,
had
effaced
every
feeling
of
envy
or
jealousy
at
Dantes
'
good
*NL*
fortune
,
--
``
upon
my
word
,
Dantes
is
a
downright
good
fellow
,
and
when
I
*NL*
see
him
sitting
there
beside
his
pretty
wife
that
is
so
soon
to
be
.
I
*NL*
can
not
help
thinking
it
would
have
been
a
great
pity
to
have
served
him
*NL*
that
trick
you
were
planning
yesterday
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
there
was
no
harm
meant
,
''
answered
Danglars
;
``
at
first
I
certainly
*NL*
did
feel
somewhat
uneasy
as
to
what
Fernand
might
be
tempted
to
do
;
but
*NL*
when
I
saw
how
completely
he
had
mastered
his
feelings
,
even
so
far
as
*NL*
to
become
one
of
his
rival
's
attendants
,
I
knew
there
was
no
further
*NL*
cause
for
apprehension
.
''
Caderousse
looked
full
at
Fernand
--
he
was
*NL*
ghastly
pale
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
,
''
continued
Danglars
,
``
the
sacrifice
was
no
trifling
one
,
*NL*
when
the
beauty
of
the
bride
is
concerned
.
Upon
my
soul
,
that
future
*NL*
captain
of
mine
is
a
lucky
dog
!
Gad
,
I
only
wish
he
would
let
me
take
*NL*
his
place
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
we
not
set
forth
?
''
asked
the
sweet
,
silvery
voice
of
Mercedes
;
*NL*
``
two
o'clock
has
just
struck
,
and
you
know
we
are
expected
in
a
quarter
*NL*
of
an
hour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
be
sure
!
--
to
be
sure
!
''
cried
Dantes
,
eagerly
quitting
the
table
;
*NL*
``
let
us
go
directly
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
words
were
re-echoed
by
the
whole
party
,
with
vociferous
cheers
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
moment
Danglars
,
who
had
been
incessantly
observing
every
change
*NL*
in
Fernand
's
look
and
manner
,
saw
him
stagger
and
fall
back
,
with
an
*NL*
almost
convulsive
spasm
,
against
a
seat
placed
near
one
of
the
open
*NL*
windows
.
At
the
same
instant
his
ear
caught
a
sort
of
indistinct
sound
*NL*
on
the
stairs
,
followed
by
the
measured
tread
of
soldiery
,
with
the
*NL*
clanking
of
swords
and
military
accoutrements
;
then
came
a
hum
and
buzz
*NL*
as
of
many
voices
,
so
as
to
deaden
even
the
noisy
mirth
of
the
bridal
*NL*
party
,
among
whom
a
vague
feeling
of
curiosity
and
apprehension
quelled
*NL*
every
disposition
to
talk
,
and
almost
instantaneously
the
most
deathlike
*NL*
stillness
prevailed
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sounds
drew
nearer
.
Three
blows
were
struck
upon
the
panel
of
the
*NL*
door
.
The
company
looked
at
each
other
in
consternation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
demand
admittance
,
''
said
a
loud
voice
outside
the
room
,
``
in
the
name
*NL*
of
the
law
!
''
As
no
attempt
was
made
to
prevent
it
,
the
door
was
opened
,
*NL*
and
a
magistrate
,
wearing
his
official
scarf
,
presented
himself
,
*NL*
followed
by
four
soldiers
and
a
corporal
.
Uneasiness
now
yielded
to
the
*NL*
most
extreme
dread
on
the
part
of
those
present
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
I
venture
to
inquire
the
reason
of
this
unexpected
visit
?
''
said
*NL*
M.
Morrel
,
addressing
the
magistrate
,
whom
he
evidently
knew
;
``
there
is
*NL*
doubtless
some
mistake
easily
explained
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
it
be
so
,
''
replied
the
magistrate
,
``
rely
upon
every
reparation
being
*NL*
made
;
meanwhile
,
I
am
the
bearer
of
an
order
of
arrest
,
and
although
I
*NL*
most
reluctantly
perform
the
task
assigned
me
,
it
must
,
nevertheless
,
be
*NL*
fulfilled
.
Who
among
the
persons
here
assembled
answers
to
the
name
of
*NL*
Edmond
Dantes
?
''
Every
eye
was
turned
towards
the
young
man
who
,
spite
of
*NL*
the
agitation
he
could
not
but
feel
,
advanced
with
dignity
,
and
said
,
in
*NL*
a
firm
voice
,
``
I
am
he
;
what
is
your
pleasure
with
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Edmond
Dantes
,
''
replied
the
magistrate
,
``
I
arrest
you
in
the
name
of
*NL*
the
law
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Me
!
''
repeated
Edmond
,
slightly
changing
color
,
``
and
wherefore
,
I
pray
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
inform
you
,
but
you
will
be
duly
acquainted
with
the
*NL*
reasons
that
have
rendered
such
a
step
necessary
at
the
preliminary
*NL*
examination
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Morrel
felt
that
further
resistance
or
remonstrance
was
useless
.
He
*NL*
saw
before
him
an
officer
delegated
to
enforce
the
law
,
and
perfectly
*NL*
well
knew
that
it
would
be
as
unavailing
to
seek
pity
from
a
magistrate
*NL*
decked
with
his
official
scarf
,
as
to
address
a
petition
to
some
cold
*NL*
marble
effigy
.
Old
Dantes
,
however
,
sprang
forward
.
There
are
situations
*NL*
which
the
heart
of
a
father
or
a
mother
can
not
be
made
to
understand
.
*NL*
He
prayed
and
supplicated
in
terms
so
moving
,
that
even
the
officer
*NL*
was
touched
,
and
,
although
firm
in
his
duty
,
he
kindly
said
,
``
My
worthy
*NL*
friend
,
let
me
beg
of
you
to
calm
your
apprehensions
.
Your
son
has
*NL*
probably
neglected
some
prescribed
form
or
attention
in
registering
his
*NL*
cargo
,
and
it
is
more
than
probable
he
will
be
set
at
liberty
directly
*NL*
he
has
given
the
information
required
,
whether
touching
the
health
of
*NL*
his
crew
,
or
the
value
of
his
freight
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
meaning
of
all
this
?
''
inquired
Caderousse
,
frowningly
,
of
*NL*
Danglars
,
who
had
assumed
an
air
of
utter
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
I
tell
you
?
''
replied
he
;
``
I
am
,
like
yourself
,
utterly
*NL*
bewildered
at
all
that
is
going
on
,
and
can
not
in
the
least
make
out
*NL*
what
it
is
about
.
''
Caderousse
then
looked
around
for
Fernand
,
but
he
had
*NL*
disappeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
scene
of
the
previous
night
now
came
back
to
his
mind
with
startling
*NL*
clearness
.
The
painful
catastrophe
he
had
just
witnessed
appeared
*NL*
effectually
to
have
rent
away
the
veil
which
the
intoxication
of
the
*NL*
evening
before
had
raised
between
himself
and
his
memory
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
,
so
,
''
said
he
,
in
a
hoarse
and
choking
voice
,
to
Danglars
,
``
this
,
*NL*
then
,
I
suppose
,
is
a
part
of
the
trick
you
were
concerting
yesterday
?
*NL*
All
I
can
say
is
,
that
if
it
be
so
,
't
is
an
ill
turn
,
and
well
deserves
*NL*
to
bring
double
evil
on
those
who
have
projected
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nonsense
,
''
returned
Danglars
,
``
I
tell
you
again
I
have
nothing
whatever
*NL*
to
do
with
it
;
besides
,
you
know
very
well
that
I
tore
the
paper
to
*NL*
pieces
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
you
did
not
!
''
answered
Caderousse
,
``
you
merely
threw
it
by
--
I
saw
*NL*
it
lying
in
a
corner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hold
your
tongue
,
you
fool
!
--
what
should
you
know
about
it
?
--
why
,
you
*NL*
were
drunk
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
is
Fernand
?
''
inquired
Caderousse
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
I
know
?
''
replied
Danglars
;
``
gone
,
as
every
prudent
man
ought
to
*NL*
be
,
to
look
after
his
own
affairs
,
most
likely
.
Never
mind
where
he
is
,
*NL*
let
you
and
I
go
and
see
what
is
to
be
done
for
our
poor
friends
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
During
this
conversation
,
Dantes
,
after
having
exchanged
a
cheerful
*NL*
shake
of
the
hand
with
all
his
sympathizing
friends
,
had
surrendered
*NL*
himself
to
the
officer
sent
to
arrest
him
,
merely
saying
,
``
Make
*NL*
yourselves
quite
easy
,
my
good
fellows
,
there
is
some
little
mistake
to
*NL*
clear
up
,
that
's
all
,
depend
upon
it
;
and
very
likely
I
may
not
have
to
*NL*
go
so
far
as
the
prison
to
effect
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
to
be
sure
!
''
responded
Danglars
,
who
had
now
approached
the
group
,
*NL*
``
nothing
more
than
a
mistake
,
I
feel
quite
certain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dantes
descended
the
staircase
,
preceded
by
the
magistrate
,
and
followed
*NL*
by
the
soldiers
.
A
carriage
awaited
him
at
the
door
;
he
got
in
,
followed
*NL*
by
two
soldiers
and
the
magistrate
,
and
the
vehicle
drove
off
towards
*NL*
Marseilles
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Adieu
,
adieu
,
dearest
Edmond
!
''
cried
Mercedes
,
stretching
out
her
arms
*NL*
to
him
from
the
balcony
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prisoner
heard
the
cry
,
which
sounded
like
the
sob
of
a
broken
*NL*
heart
,
and
leaning
from
the
coach
he
called
out
,
``
Good-by
,
Mercedes
--
we
*NL*
shall
soon
meet
again
!
''
Then
the
vehicle
disappeared
round
one
of
the
*NL*
turnings
of
Fort
Saint
Nicholas
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait
for
me
here
,
all
of
you
!
''
cried
M.
Morrel
;
``
I
will
take
the
first
*NL*
conveyance
I
find
,
and
hurry
to
Marseilles
,
whence
I
will
bring
you
word
*NL*
how
all
is
going
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
right
!
''
exclaimed
a
multitude
of
voices
,
``
go
,
and
return
as
*NL*
quickly
as
you
can
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
second
departure
was
followed
by
a
long
and
fearful
state
of
*NL*
terrified
silence
on
the
part
of
those
who
were
left
behind
.
The
old
*NL*
father
and
Mercedes
remained
for
some
time
apart
,
each
absorbed
in
*NL*
grief
;
but
at
length
the
two
poor
victims
of
the
same
blow
raised
their
*NL*
eyes
,
and
with
a
simultaneous
burst
of
feeling
rushed
into
each
other
's
*NL*
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
Fernand
made
his
appearance
,
poured
out
for
himself
a
glass
*NL*
of
water
with
a
trembling
hand
;
then
hastily
swallowing
it
,
went
to
sit
*NL*
down
at
the
first
vacant
place
,
and
this
was
,
by
mere
chance
,
placed
*NL*
next
to
the
seat
on
which
poor
Mercedes
had
fallen
half
fainting
,
*NL*
when
released
from
the
warm
and
affectionate
embrace
of
old
Dantes
.
*NL*
Instinctively
Fernand
drew
back
his
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
the
cause
of
all
this
misery
--
I
am
quite
sure
of
it
,
''
whispered
*NL*
Caderousse
,
who
had
never
taken
his
eyes
off
Fernand
,
to
Danglars
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
so
,
''
answered
the
other
;
``
he
's
too
stupid
to
imagine
such
*NL*
a
scheme
.
I
only
hope
the
mischief
will
fall
upon
the
head
of
whoever
*NL*
wrought
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
mention
those
who
aided
and
abetted
the
deed
,
''
said
*NL*
Caderousse
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Surely
,
''
answered
Danglars
,
``
one
can
not
be
held
responsible
for
every
*NL*
chance
arrow
shot
into
the
air
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
,
indeed
,
when
the
arrow
lights
point
downward
on
somebody
's
*NL*
head
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Meantime
the
subject
of
the
arrest
was
being
canvassed
in
every
*NL*
different
form
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
think
you
,
Danglars
,
''
said
one
of
the
party
,
turning
towards
him
,
*NL*
``
of
this
event
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
''
replied
he
,
``
I
think
it
just
possible
Dantes
may
have
been
*NL*
detected
with
some
trifling
article
on
board
ship
considered
here
as
*NL*
contraband
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
how
could
he
have
done
so
without
your
knowledge
,
Danglars
,
since
*NL*
you
are
the
ship
's
supercargo
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
as
for
that
,
I
could
only
know
what
I
was
told
respecting
the
*NL*
merchandise
with
which
the
vessel
was
laden
.
I
know
she
was
loaded
with
*NL*
cotton
,
and
that
she
took
in
her
freight
at
Alexandria
from
Pastret
's
*NL*
warehouse
,
and
at
Smyrna
from
Pascal
's
;
that
is
all
I
was
obliged
to
*NL*
know
,
and
I
beg
I
may
not
be
asked
for
any
further
particulars
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
I
recollect
,
''
said
the
afflicted
old
father
;
``
my
poor
boy
told
me
*NL*
yesterday
he
had
got
a
small
case
of
coffee
,
and
another
of
tobacco
for
*NL*
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
you
see
,
''
exclaimed
Danglars
.
``
Now
the
mischief
is
out
;
depend
*NL*
upon
it
the
custom-house
people
went
rummaging
about
the
ship
in
our
*NL*
absence
,
and
discovered
poor
Dantes
'
hidden
treasures
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mercedes
,
however
,
paid
no
heed
to
this
explanation
of
her
lover
's
*NL*
arrest
.
Her
grief
,
which
she
had
hitherto
tried
to
restrain
,
now
burst
*NL*
out
in
a
violent
fit
of
hysterical
sobbing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
come
,
''
said
the
old
man
,
``
be
comforted
,
my
poor
child
;
there
is
*NL*
still
hope
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hope
!
''
repeated
Danglars
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hope
!
''
faintly
murmured
Fernand
,
but
the
word
seemed
to
die
away
on
his
*NL*
pale
agitated
lips
,
and
a
convulsive
spasm
passed
over
his
countenance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
news
!
good
news
!
''
shouted
forth
one
of
the
party
stationed
in
the
*NL*
balcony
on
the
lookout
.
``
Here
comes
M.
Morrel
back
.
No
doubt
,
now
,
we
*NL*
shall
hear
that
our
friend
is
released
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mercedes
and
the
old
man
rushed
to
meet
the
shipowner
and
greeted
him
at
*NL*
the
door
.
He
was
very
pale
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
news
?
''
exclaimed
a
general
burst
of
voices
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas
,
my
friends
,
''
replied
M.
Morrel
,
with
a
mournful
shake
of
his
*NL*
head
,
``
the
thing
has
assumed
a
more
serious
aspect
than
I
expected
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
indeed
--
indeed
,
sir
,
he
is
innocent
!
''
sobbed
forth
Mercedes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
I
believe
!
''
answered
M.
Morrel
;
``
but
still
he
is
charged
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
what
?
''
inquired
the
elder
Dantes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
being
an
agent
of
the
Bonapartist
faction
!
''
Many
of
our
readers
*NL*
may
be
able
to
recollect
how
formidable
such
an
accusation
became
in
the
*NL*
period
at
which
our
story
is
dated
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
despairing
cry
escaped
the
pale
lips
of
Mercedes
;
the
old
man
sank
*NL*
into
a
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
Danglars
!
''
whispered
Caderousse
,
``
you
have
deceived
me
--
the
trick
*NL*
you
spoke
of
last
night
has
been
played
;
but
I
can
not
suffer
a
poor
*NL*
old
man
or
an
innocent
girl
to
die
of
grief
through
your
fault
.
I
am
*NL*
determined
to
tell
them
all
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
silent
,
you
simpleton
!
''
cried
Danglars
,
grasping
him
by
the
arm
,
``
or
*NL*
I
will
not
answer
even
for
your
own
safety
.
Who
can
tell
whether
Dantes
*NL*
be
innocent
or
guilty
?
The
vessel
did
touch
at
Elba
,
where
he
quitted
*NL*
it
,
and
passed
a
whole
day
in
the
island
.
Now
,
should
any
letters
or
*NL*
other
documents
of
a
compromising
character
be
found
upon
him
,
will
it
*NL*
not
be
taken
for
granted
that
all
who
uphold
him
are
his
accomplices
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
the
rapid
instinct
of
selfishness
,
Caderousse
readily
perceived
the
*NL*
solidity
of
this
mode
of
reasoning
;
he
gazed
,
doubtfully
,
wistfully
,
on
*NL*
Danglars
,
and
then
caution
supplanted
generosity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Suppose
we
wait
a
while
,
and
see
what
comes
of
it
,
''
said
he
,
casting
a
*NL*
bewildered
look
on
his
companion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
be
sure
!
''
answered
Danglars
.
``
Let
us
wait
,
by
all
means
.
If
he
be
*NL*
innocent
,
of
course
he
will
be
set
at
liberty
;
if
guilty
,
why
,

is
no

ourselves
in

*NL*
*NL*

Let

go

I
can
not
stay
here
any
longer

*NL*
*NL*
``
With
all
my

''
replied
Danglars
,
pleased
to
find
the
other
so
*NL*
tractable
.
``
Let
us
take
ourselves
out
of

leave
things

the

to
take
their

*NL*
*NL*
After
their
departure
,
Fernand
,
who
had
now
again
become
the
friend
and
*NL*
protector
of
Mercedes
,
led
the
girl
to
her
home
,
while
the
friends
of
*NL*
Dantes
conducted
the
now
half-fainting
man
back
to
his
abode
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
rumor
of
Edmond
's
arrest
as
a
Bonapartist
agent
was
not
slow
in
*NL*
circulating
throughout
the
city
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Could
you
ever
have
credited
such
a
thing
,
my
dear
Danglars
?
''
asked
M.
*NL*
Morrel
,
as
,
on
his
return
to
the
port
for
the
purpose
of
gleaning
fresh
*NL*
tidings
of
Dantes
,
from
M.
de
Villefort
,
the
assistant
procureur
,
he
*NL*
overtook
his
supercargo
and
Caderousse
.
``
Could
you
have
believed
such
a
*NL*
thing
possible
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
you
know
I
told
you
,
''
replied
Danglars
,
``
that
I
considered
the
*NL*
circumstance
of
his
having
anchored
at
the
Island
of
Elba
as
a
very
*NL*
suspicious
circumstance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
did
you
mention
these
suspicions
to
any
person
beside
myself
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
not
!
''
returned
Danglars
.
Then
added
in
a
low
whisper
,
``
You
*NL*
understand
that
,
on
account
of
your
uncle

M.
Policar
Morrel

who
served
*NL*
under
the
other
government
,
and
who
does
not
altogether
conceal
what
*NL*
he
thinks
on
the
subject

you
are
strongly
suspected
of
regretting
the
*NL*
abdication
of
Napoleon
.
I
should
have
feared
to
injure
both
Edmond
and
*NL*
yourself
,
had
I
divulged
my
own
apprehensions
to
a
soul

I
am
too
well
*NL*
aware
that
though
a
subordinate
,
like
myself
,
is
bound
to
acquaint
the
*NL*
shipowner
with
everything
that
occurs
,
there
are
many
things
he
ought

most
carefully
to
conceal
from
all
else

*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
well

Danglars

't
is
well

replied
M.
Morrel

``
You
are
a
worthy

I
had
already
thought
of
your
interests

Edmond
having
become
captain
of
the
Pharaon

*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
possible
you
were
so
kind

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

I
had
previously
inquired
of
Dantes
what
was
his
opinion

of
you

if
he
should
have
any
reluctance
to
continue
you
in
your

post

somehow
I
have
perceived
a
sort
of
coolness
between
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
was
his
reply
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
he
certainly
did
think
he
had
given
you
offence
in
an
affair
*NL*
which
he
merely
referred
to
without
entering
into
particulars
,
but
that
*NL*
whoever
possessed
the
good
opinion
and
confidence
of
the
ship
's
owner
*NL*
would
have
his
preference
also
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
The
hypocrite
!

murmured
Danglars
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
Dantes

said
Caderousse
.
``
No
one
can
deny
his
being
a

noble-hearted
young
fellow

*NL*
*NL*

But
meanwhile

continued
M.
Morrel
,
``
here
is
the
Pharaon
without

*NL*
*NL*

Oh

replied
Danglars
,
``
since
we
can
not
leave
this

three

No

M.

answered
Danglars

You

that
I
am
as
capable

managing
a

service

it
will
be
so
far
advantageous
to
you
to
accept
my

services
,
that
upon
Edmond
's
release
from
prison
no
further
change
will
*NL*
be
requisite

for

*NL*
*NL*
``
Thanks

Danglars

that
will
smooth
over
all
difficulties

I
fully
*NL*
authorize
you
at
once
to
assume
the
command
of
the
Pharaon
,
and
look
*NL*
carefully
to
the
unloading
of
her
freight

Private
misfortunes
must
*NL*
never
be
allowed
to
interfere
with
business

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
easy
on
that
score

M.
Morrel

do
you
think
we
shall
be

permitted

see
our
poor
Edmond

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
let
you

directly
I
have
seen
M.
de
Villefort
,
whom
I
*NL*
shall
endeavor
to
interest
in
Edmond
's
favor
.
I
am
aware
he
is
a
furious
*NL*
royalist
;
but
,
in
spite
of
that
,
and
of
his
being
king
's
attorney
,
he
is
*NL*
a
man
like
ourselves
,
and
I
fancy
not
a
bad
sort
of
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
not
,
''
replied
Danglars
;
``
but
I
hear
that
he
is
ambitious
,
and
*NL*
that
's
rather
against
him

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

well
,

returned
M.
Morrel
,
``
we
shall
see

But
now
hasten
on
*NL*
board
,
I
will
join
you
there
ere
long
.

So
saying
,
the
worthy
shipowner
*NL*
quitted
the
two
allies
,
and
proceeded
in
the
direction
of
the
Palais
de
*NL*
Justice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
''
said
Danglars
,
addressing
Caderousse
,
``
the
turn
things
have
*NL*
taken

Do
you
still
feel
any
desire
to
stand
up
in
his
defence
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
the
slightest
,
but
yet
it
seems
to
me
a
shocking
thing
that
a
mere
*NL*
joke
should
lead
to
such
consequences
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
who
perpetrated
that
joke
,
let
me
ask
?
neither
you
nor
myself
,
but
*NL*
Fernand
;
you
knew
very
well
that
I
threw
the
paper
into
a
corner
of
the
*NL*
room
--
indeed
,
I
fancied
I
had
destroyed
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
''
replied
Caderousse
,
``
that
I
can
answer
for
,
you
did
not

I
*NL*
only
wish
I
could
see
it
now
as
plainly
as
I
saw
it
lying
all
crushed
*NL*

crumpled
in
a
corner
of
the
arbor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
if
you
did
,
depend
upon
it
,
Fernand
picked
it
up
,
and
*NL*
either
copied
it
or
caused
it
to
be
copied
;
perhaps
,
even
,
he
did
not
*NL*
take
the
trouble
of
recopying
it
.
And
now
I
think
of
it
,
by
Heavens
,
he
*NL*
may
have
sent
the
letter
itself
!
Fortunately
,
for
me
,
the
handwriting
*NL*
was
disguised
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
were
aware
of
Dantes
being
engaged
in
a
conspiracy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
I
.
As
I
before
said
,
I
thought
the
whole
thing
was
a
joke
,
nothing
*NL*
more
.
It
seems
,
however
,
that
I
have
unconsciously
stumbled
upon
the
*NL*
truth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Still
,
''
argued
Caderousse
,
``
I
would
give
a
great
deal
if
nothing
of
the
*NL*
kind
had
happened
;
or
,
at
least
,
that
I
had
had
no
hand
in
it
.
You
will
*NL*
see
,
Danglars
,
that
it
will
turn
out
an
unlucky
job
for
both
of
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nonsense
!
If
any
harm
come
of
it
,
it
should
fall
on
the
guilty
person
;
*NL*

that
,
you
know
,
is
Fernand
.
How
can
we
be
implicated
in
any
way
?
*NL*
All
we
have
got
to
do
is
,
to
keep
our
own
counsel
,
and
remain
perfectly
*NL*
quiet
,
not
breathing
a
word
to
any
living
soul
;
and
you
will
see
that
*NL*
the
storm
will
pass
away
without
in
the
least
affecting
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Amen
!
''
responded
Caderousse
,
waving
his
hand
in
token
of
adieu
to
*NL*
Danglars
,
and
bending
his
steps
towards
the
Allees
de
Meillan
,
moving
*NL*
his
head
to
and
fro
,
and
muttering
as
he
went
,
after
the
manner
of
one
*NL*
whose
mind
was
overcharged
with
one
absorbing
idea
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
far
,
then
,
''
said
Danglars
,
mentally
,
``
all
has
gone
as
I
would
have
*NL*
it
.
I
am
,
temporarily
,
commander
of
the
Pharaon

with
the
certainty
of
*NL*
being
permanently
so
,
if
that
fool
of
a
Caderousse
can
be
persuaded
to
*NL*
hold
his
tongue
.
My
only
fear
is
the
chance
of
Dantes
being
released
.
*NL*
But
,
there
,
he
is
in
the
hands
of
Justice
;
and
,
''
added
he
with
a
smile
,
*NL*
``
she
will
take
her
own
.
''
So
saying
,
he
leaped
into
a
boat
,
desiring
to
*NL*
be
rowed
on
board
the
Pharaon
,
where
M.

had
agreed
to
meet
him

Chapter
6
.
The
Deputy
Procureur
du
Roi
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
one
of
the
aristocratic
mansions
built
by
Puget
in
the
Rue
du
Grand
*NL*
Cours
opposite
the
Medusa
fountain
,
a
second
marriage
feast
was
being
*NL*
celebrated
,
almost
at
the
same
hour
with
the
nuptial
repast
given
*NL*
by
Dantes
.
In
this
case
,
however
,
although
the
occasion
of
the
*NL*
entertainment
was
similar
,
the
company
was
strikingly
dissimilar
.
*NL*
Instead
of
a
rude
mixture
of
sailors
,
soldiers
,
and
those
belonging
to
*NL*
the
humblest
grade
of
life
,
the
present
assembly
was
composed
of
the
*NL*
very
flower
of
Marseilles
society
,
--
magistrates
who
had
resigned
their
*NL*
office
during
the
usurper
's
reign
;
officers
who
had
deserted
from
the
*NL*
imperial
army
and
joined
forces
with
Conde
;
and
younger
members
of
*NL*
families
,
brought
up
to
hate
and
execrate
the
man
whom
five
years
of
*NL*
exile
would
convert
into
a
martyr
,
and
fifteen
of
restoration
elevate
to
*NL*
the
rank
of
a
god
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
guests
were
still
at
table
,
and
the
heated
and
energetic
*NL*
conversation
that
prevailed
betrayed
the
violent
and
vindictive
passions
*NL*
that
then
agitated
each
dweller
of
the
South
,
where
unhappily
,
for
five
*NL*
centuries
religious
strife
had
long
given
increased
bitterness
to
the
*NL*
violence
of
party
feeling
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
emperor
,
now
king
of
the
petty
Island
of
Elba
,
after
having
held
*NL*
sovereign
sway
over
one-half
of
the
world
,
counting
as
his
subjects
*NL*
a
small
population
of
five
or
six
thousand
souls
,
--
after
having
been
*NL*
accustomed
to
hear
the
``
Vive
Napoleons
''
of
a
hundred
and
twenty
millions
*NL*
of
human
beings
,
uttered
in
ten
different
languages
,
--
was
looked
upon
*NL*
here
as
a
ruined
man
,
separated
forever
from
any
fresh
connection
with
*NL*
France
or
claim
to
her
throne
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
magistrates
freely
discussed
their
political
views
;
the
military
*NL*
part
of
the
company
talked
unreservedly
of
Moscow
and
Leipsic
,
while
*NL*
the
women
commented
on
the
divorce
of
Josephine
.
It
was
not
over
the
*NL*
downfall
of
the
man
,
but
over
the
defeat
of
the
Napoleonic
idea
,
that
*NL*
they
rejoiced
,
and
in
this
they
foresaw
for
themselves
the
bright
and
*NL*
cheering
prospect
of
a
revivified
political
existence
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
old
man
,
decorated
with
the
cross
of
Saint
Louis
,
now
rose
and
*NL*
proposed
the
health
of
King
Louis
XVIII
.
It
was
the
Marquis
de
*NL*
Saint-Meran
.
This
toast
,
recalling
at
once
the
patient
exile
of
Hartwell
*NL*
and
the
peace-loving
King
of
France
,
excited
universal
enthusiasm
;
*NL*
glasses
were
elevated
in
the
air
a
l'Anglais
,
and
the
ladies
,
snatching
*NL*
their
bouquets
from
their
fair
bosoms
,
strewed
the
table
with
their
*NL*
floral
treasures
.
In
a
word
,
an
almost
poetical
fervor
prevailed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
said
the
Marquise
de
Saint-Meran
,
a
woman
with
a
stern
,
forbidding
*NL*
eye

though
still
noble
and
distinguished
in
appearance
,
despite
her
*NL*
fifty
years

``

*NL*

replied
the
marquise

with
a
look
of
tenderness

that
seemed
out
of
keeping
with

harsh
dry
features

,
however
all

be
withered
in

there
is
always
one

bright
smiling

in
the
desert
of
her

that
is
the
shrine
*NL*
of
maternal
love

``
I
forgive
you

What
I
was
saying

Villefort

was

what

the
young

``

that
was
fanaticism

Napoleon
is
the
*NL*
Mahomet
of
the
West

is
worshipped
by
his
commonplace

*NL*
ambitions
followers
,
not

as

lawgiver

also
as
the
*NL*
personification
of
equality

*NL*
``
He

cried
the

Napoleon

you
call

the

of
his
just
rights

bestow
them
on

*NL*
``
Nay

his
scaffold
in

Place
Louis
Quinze
;
*NL*
that
of
Napoleon
on
the
column
of
the
Place

The
only
difference
*NL*
consists
in
the
opposite
character
of
the
equality
advocated
by
these
*NL*
two
men
;
one
is
the
equality
that
elevates
,
the
other
is
the
equality
*NL*
that
degrades
;
one
brings
a
king
within
reach
of
the
guillotine

the
*NL*
other
elevates
the
people
to
a
level

said
*NL*
Villefort
,
smiling
,
``
I
do
not
mean
to
deny
that
both

the
9th

and
the
4th
of

excuse
it

impossible

suffused
the

I
may
remark

stanchest
adherents

exiled

your

lost
no

I

not

Nowadays
*NL*
the
military
profession
is
in
abeyance
and
the
magisterial
robe
is
*NL*
the
badge
of
honor

is
a

that
is
very
much
in

*NL*

Renee

regretting

*NL*

tenderness
on

speaker

will
*NL*
have
achieved
a
noble
work

efface

the
incorrigible
marquise

Villefort

mournful

I

abjured

that

zealous
friend

a
better
royalist

he
has
to
atone
for

dereliction

I
have
no
other

impulse
than
warm
,
decided
preference

conviction

''
Having
made
this
*NL*
well-turned
speech
,
Villefort
looked
carefully
around
to
mark
the
effect
*NL*
of
his
oratory
,
much
as
he
would
have
done
had
he
been
addressing
the
*NL*
bench
in
open
court
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
,
my
dear
Villefort
,
''
cried
the
Comte
de
Salvieux
,
``
that
*NL*
is
exactly
what
I
myself
said
the
other
day
at
the
Tuileries
,
when
*NL*
questioned
by
his
majesty
's
principal
chamberlain
touching
the
*NL*
singularity
of
an
alliance
between
the
son
of
a
Girondin
and
the
*NL*
daughter
of
an
officer
of
the
Duc
de
Conde
;
and
I
assure
you
he
seemed
*NL*
fully
to
comprehend
that
this
mode
of
reconciling
political
differences
*NL*
was
based
upon
sound
and
excellent
principles
.
Then
the
king
,
who
,
*NL*
without
our
suspecting
it
,
had
overheard
our
conversation
,
interrupted
*NL*
us
by
saying
,
`
Villefort
'
--
observe
that
the
king
did
not
pronounce
the
*NL*
word
Noirtier
,
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
placed
considerable
emphasis
on
*NL*
that
of
Villefort

Villefort

said
his
majesty

great
judgment

discretion

who
will
be
sure
to
make
a
figure
in
his
*NL*
profession
;
I
like
him
much
,
and
it
gave
me
great
pleasure
to
hear
that
*NL*
he
was
about
to
become
the
son-in-law
of
the
Marquis
and
Marquise
de
*NL*
Saint-Meran
.
I
should
myself
have
recommended
the
match
,
had
not
the
*NL*
noble
marquis
anticipated
my
wishes
by
requesting
my
consent
to
it
.

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
possible
the
king
could
have
condescended
so
far
as
to
express

himself
so
favorably
of
me

''
asked
the
enraptured
Villefort
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
give
you
his
very
words
;
and
if
the
marquis
chooses
to
be
candid
,
*NL*
he
will
confess
that
they
perfectly
agree
with
what
his
majesty
said
to
*NL*
him
,
when
he
went
six
months
ago
to
consult
him
upon
the
subject
of
your
*NL*
espousing
his
daughter

*NL*
*NL*

That

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
right

cried
the
marquise

he
would
be
most
welcome

*NL*
*NL*
``
For
my

Renee
,
``
I
trust
your

not
prosper

miserable
cheats
to
fall
into
M.

hands
,

then
I
shall
be
contented

*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
the

as

prescribe
for
headaches

measles
,
and
the
stings
of
*NL*
wasps

any
other
slight
affection
of
the
epidermis
.
If
you
wish
to
*NL*
see
me

you
must
desire
for
me
some
of
those
violent

dangerous
diseases
from
the
cure

which
so
much
honor
redounds
to

the
physician

*NL*
*NL*
At
this
moment
,
and
as
though
the
utterance
of
Villefort
's
wish
had
*NL*
sufficed
to
effect
its
accomplishment
,
a
servant
entered
the
room
,
and
*NL*
whispered
a
few
words
in
his
ear
.
Villefort
immediately
rose
from
table
*NL*
and
quitted
the
room
upon
the
plea
of
urgent
business
;
he
soon
,
however
,
*NL*
returned
,
his
whole
face
beaming
with
delight

Renee
regarded
him
with
*NL*
fond
affection
;
and
certainly
his
handsome
features
,
lit
up
as
they
then
*NL*
were
with
more
than
usual
fire
and
animation
,
seemed
formed
to
excite
*NL*
the
innocent
admiration
with
which
she
gazed
on
her
graceful
and
*NL*
intelligent
lover
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
were

now

said
Villefort

addressing
her
,
``
that

I
were

Well

I
at

resemble

Esculapius
in
one
thing

that
of

*NL*
``
And
wherefore

asked
Mademoiselle

Saint-Meran

with
an
air
of
deep
interest

*NL*
*NL*
``
For

``
How

exclaimed
Renee

turning
pale

*NL*
``
Is

burst
simultaneously
from
all
who
were
near
enough

the
magistrate

hear
his
words

*NL*
``
I
will
read

the
letter

Villefort

The

religions
institutions

that
one
named
Edmond

mate
of
the

Pharaon
,
this
day
arrived
from
Smyrna
,
after
having

again
taken

Ample
corroboration

this

be
obtained
by
arresting
the
above-mentioned
Edmond

Dantes

who
either
carries
the
letter

Should

the

*NL*
``
O

cried
Renee

clasping
her
hands

and
looking
towards
*NL*
her
lover
with
piteous
earnestness
,
``
be
merciful

this
the
day

*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
passed
round
to
the
side
of
the
table
where
the
fair
*NL*
pleader
sat
,
and
leaning
over
her
chair
said
tenderly
,

Never

So
saying

Madame

extended

her
dry
bony
hand
to
Villefort
,
who
,
while
imprinting
a
son-in-law
's
*NL*
respectful
salute
on
it
,
looked
at
Renee

as
much
as
to

exclaimed
the
angry

*NL*
then
casting
an
expressive
glance
at
his
betrothed

seemed
to

Chapter
7
.
The
Examination
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
sooner
had
Villefort
left
the
salon
,
than
he
assumed
the
grave
air
*NL*
of
a
man
who
holds
the
balance
of
life
and
death
in
his
hands
.
Now
,
in
*NL*
spite
of
the
nobility
of
his
countenance
,
the
command
of
which
,
like
a
*NL*
finished
actor
,
he
had
carefully
studied
before
the
glass
,
it
was
by
*NL*
no
means
easy
for
him
to
assume
an
air
of
judicial
severity
.
Except
the
*NL*
recollection
of
the
line
of
politics
his
father
had
adopted
,
and
which
*NL*
might
interfere
,
unless
he
acted
with
the
greatest
prudence
,
with
his
*NL*
own
career
,
Gerard
de
Villefort
was
as
happy
as
a
man
could
be
.
Already
*NL*
rich
,
he
held
a
high
official
situation
,
though
only
twenty-seven
.
*NL*
He
was
about
to
marry
a
young
and
charming
woman
,
whom
he
loved
,
not
*NL*
passionately
,
but
reasonably
,
as
became
a
deputy
attorney
of
the
*NL*
king
;
and
besides
her
personal
attractions
,
which
were
very
great
,
*NL*
Mademoiselle
de
Saint-Meran
's
family
possessed
considerable
political
*NL*
influence
,
which
they
would
,
of
course
,
exert
in
his
favor
.
The
dowry
*NL*
of
his
wife
amounted
to
fifty
thousand
crowns
,
and
he
had
,
besides
,
*NL*
the
prospect
of
seeing
her
fortune
increased
to
half
a
million
at
her
*NL*
father
's
death
.
These
considerations
naturally
gave
Villefort
a
feeling
*NL*
of
such
complete
felicity
that
his
mind
was
fairly
dazzled
in
its
*NL*
contemplation
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
door
he
met
the
commissary
of
police
,
who
was
waiting
for
him
.
*NL*
The
sight
of
this
officer
recalled
Villefort
from
the
third
heaven
to
*NL*
earth
;
he
composed
his
face
,
as
we
have
before
described
,
and
said
,
``
I
*NL*
have
read
the
letter
,
sir
,
and
you
have
acted
rightly
in
arresting
*NL*
this
man
;
now
inform
me
what
you
have
discovered
concerning
him
and
the
*NL*
conspiracy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
know
nothing
as
yet
of
the
conspiracy
,
monsieur
;
all
the
papers
*NL*
found
have
been
sealed
up
and
placed
on
your
desk
.
The
prisoner
himself
*NL*
is
named
Edmond
Dantes
,
mate
on
board
the
three-master
the
Pharaon
,
*NL*
trading
in
cotton
with
Alexandria
and
Smyrna
,
and
belonging
to
Morrel
&
*NL*
Son
,
of
Marseilles
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Before
he
entered
the
merchant
service
,
had
he
ever
served
in
the
*NL*
marines
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
monsieur
,
he
is
very
young
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
old
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nineteen
or
twenty
at
the
most
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
moment
,
and
as
Villefort
had
arrived
at
the
corner
of
the
*NL*
Rue
des
Conseils
,
a
man
,
who
seemed
to
have
been
waiting
for
him
,
*NL*
approached
;
it
was
M.
Morrel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
M.
de
Villefort
,
''
cried
he
,
``
I
am
delighted
to
see
you
.
Some
*NL*
of
your
people
have
committed
the
strangest
mistake
--
they
have
just
*NL*
arrested
Edmond
Dantes
,
mate
of
my
vessel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
it
,
monsieur
,
''
replied
Villefort
,
``
and
I
am
now
going
to
examine
*NL*
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
said
Morrel
,
carried
away
by
his
friendship
,
``
you
do
not
know
him
,
*NL*
and
I
do
.
He
is
the
most
estimable
,
the
most
trustworthy
creature
in
the
*NL*
world
,
and
I
will
venture
to
say
,
there
is
not
a
better
seaman
in
all
*NL*
the
merchant
service
.
Oh
,
M.
de
Villefort
,
I
beseech
your
indulgence
for
*NL*
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Villefort
,
as
we
have
seen
,
belonged
to
the
aristocratic
party
at
*NL*
Marseilles
,
Morrel
to
the
plebeian
;
the
first
was
a
royalist
,
the
other
*NL*
suspected
of
Bonapartism
.
Villefort
looked
disdainfully
at
Morrel
,
and
*NL*
replied
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
aware
,
monsieur
,
that
a
man
may
be
estimable
and
trustworthy
in
*NL*
private
life
,
and
the
best
seaman
in
the
merchant
service
,
and
yet
be
,
*NL*
politically
speaking
,
a
great
criminal
.
Is
it
not
true
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
magistrate
laid
emphasis
on
these
words
,
as
if
he
wished
to
apply
*NL*
them
to
the
owner
himself
,
while
his
eyes
seemed
to
plunge
into
*NL*
the
heart
of
one
who
,
interceding
for
another
,
had
himself
need
of
*NL*
indulgence
.
Morrel
reddened
,
for
his
own
conscience
was
not
quite
clear
*NL*
on
politics
;
besides
,
what
Dantes
had
told
him
of
his
interview
with
the
*NL*
grand-marshal
,
and
what
the
emperor
had
said
to
him
,
embarrassed
him
.
He
*NL*
replied
,
however
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
entreat
you
,
M.
de
Villefort
,
be
,
as
you
always
are
,
kind
and
*NL*
equitable
,
and
give
him
back
to
us
soon
.
''
This
give
us
sounded
*NL*
revolutionary
in
the
deputy
's
ears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
ah
,
''
murmured
he
,
``
is
Dantes
then
a
member
of
some
Carbonari
*NL*
society
,
that
his
protector
thus
employs
the
collective
form
?
He
was
,
if
*NL*
I
recollect
,
arrested
in
a
tavern
,
in
company
with
a
great
many
others
.
''
*NL*
Then
he
added
,
``
Monsieur
,
you
may
rest
assured
I
shall
perform
my
duty
*NL*
impartially
,
and
that
if
he
be
innocent
you
shall
not
have
appealed
*NL*
to
me
in
vain
;
should
he
,
however
,
be
guilty
,
in
this
present
epoch
,
*NL*
impunity
would
furnish
a
dangerous
example
,
and
I
must
do
my
duty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
had
now
arrived
at
the
door
of
his
own
house
,
which
adjoined
*NL*
the
Palais
de
Justice
,
he
entered
,
after
having
,
coldly
saluted
the
*NL*
shipowner
,
who
stood
,
as
if
petrified
,
on
the
spot
where
Villefort
had
*NL*
left
him
.
The
ante-chamber
was
full
of
police
agents
and
gendarmes
,
in
*NL*
the
midst
of
whom
,
carefully
watched
,
but
calm
and
smiling
,
stood
the
*NL*
prisoner
.
Villefort
traversed
the
ante-chamber
,
cast
a
side
glance
at
*NL*
Dantes
,
and
taking
a
packet
which
a
gendarme
offered
him
,
disappeared
,
*NL*
saying
,
``
Bring
in
the
prisoner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Rapid
as
had
been
Villefort
's
glance
,
it
had
served
to
give
him
an
idea
*NL*
of
the
man
he
was
about
to
interrogate
.
He
had
recognized
intelligence
*NL*
in
the
high
forehead
,
courage
in
the
dark
eye
and
bent
brow
,
and
*NL*
frankness
in
the
thick
lips
that
showed
a
set
of
pearly
teeth
.
*NL*
Villefort
's
first
impression
was
favorable
;
but
he
had
been
so
often
*NL*
warned
to
mistrust
first
impulses
,
that
he
applied
the
maxim
to
the
*NL*
impression
,
forgetting
the
difference
between
the
two
words
.
He
stifled
,
*NL*
therefore
,
the
feelings
of
compassion
that
were
rising
,
composed
his
*NL*
features
,
and
sat
down
,
grim
and
sombre
,
at
his
desk
.
An
instant
after
*NL*
Dantes
entered
.
He
was
pale
,
but
calm
and
collected
,
and
saluting
his
*NL*
judge
with
easy
politeness
,
looked
round
for
a
seat
,
as
if
he
had
been
*NL*
in
M.
Morrel
's
salon
.
It
was
then
that
he
encountered
for
the
first
*NL*
time
Villefort
's
look
,
--
that
look
peculiar
to
the
magistrate
,
who
,
while
*NL*
seeming
to
read
the
thoughts
of
others
,
betrays
nothing
of
his
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
and
what
are
you
?
''
demanded
Villefort
,
turning
over
a
pile
of
*NL*
papers
,
containing
information
relative
to
the
prisoner
,
that
a
police
*NL*
agent
had
given
to
him
on
his
entry
,
and
that
,
already
,
in
an
hour
's
*NL*
time
,
had
swelled
to
voluminous
proportions
,
thanks
to
the
corrupt
*NL*
espionage
of
which
``
the
accused
''
is
always
made
the
victim
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
name
is
Edmond
Dantes
,
''
replied
the
young
man
calmly
;
``
I
am
mate
of
*NL*
the
Pharaon
,
belonging
to
Messrs.
Morrel
&
Son
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
age
?
''
continued
Villefort
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nineteen
,
''
returned
Dantes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
were
you
doing
at
the
moment
you
were
arrested
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
at
the
festival
of
my
marriage
,
monsieur
,
''
said
the
young
man
,
*NL*
his
voice
slightly
tremulous
,
so
great
was
the
contrast
between
that
*NL*
happy
moment
and
the
painful
ceremony
he
was
now
undergoing
;
so
great
*NL*
was
the
contrast
between
the
sombre
aspect
of
M.
de
Villefort
and
the
*NL*
radiant
face
of
Mercedes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
were
at
the
festival
of
your
marriage
?
''
said
the
deputy
,
shuddering
*NL*
in
spite
of
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
monsieur
;
I
am
on
the
point
of
marrying
a
young
girl
I
have
been
*NL*
attached
to
for
three
years
.
''
Villefort
,
impassive
as
he
was
,
was
struck
*NL*
with
this
coincidence
;
and
the
tremulous
voice
of
Dantes
,
surprised
*NL*
in
the
midst
of
his
happiness
,
struck
a
sympathetic
chord
in
his
own
*NL*
bosom
--
he
also
was
on
the
point
of
being
married
,
and
he
was
summoned
*NL*
from
his
own
happiness
to
destroy
that
of
another
.
``
This
philosophic
*NL*
reflection
,
''
thought
he
,
``
will
make
a
great
sensation
at
M.
de
*NL*
Saint-Meran
's
;
''
and
he
arranged
mentally
,
while
Dantes
awaited
further
*NL*
questions
,
the
antithesis
by
which
orators
often
create
a
reputation
for
*NL*
eloquence
.
When
this
speech
was
arranged
,
Villefort
turned
to
Dantes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
on
,
sir
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
would
you
have
me
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
all
the
information
in
your
power
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
on
which
point
you
desire
information
,
and
I
will
tell
all
I
*NL*
know
;
only
,
''
added
he
,
with
a
smile
,
``
I
warn
you
I
know
very
little
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
served
under
the
usurper
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
about
to
be
mustered
into
the
Royal
Marines
when
he
fell
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
reported
your
political
opinions
are
extreme
,
''
said
Villefort
,
*NL*
who
had
never
heard
anything
of
the
kind
,
but
was
not
sorry
to
make
this
*NL*
inquiry
,
as
if
it
were
an
accusation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
political
opinions
!
''
replied
Dantes
.
``
Alas
,
sir
,
I
never
had
any
*NL*
opinions
.
I
am
hardly
nineteen
;
I
know
nothing
;
I
have
no
part
to
play
.
*NL*
If
I
obtain
the
situation
I
desire
,
I
shall
owe
it
to
M.
Morrel
.
Thus
*NL*
all
my
opinions
--
I
will
not
say
public
,
but
private
--
are
confined
to
*NL*
these
three
sentiments
,
--
I
love
my
father
,
I
respect
M.
Morrel
,
and
*NL*
I
adore
Mercedes
.
This
,
sir
,
is
all
I
can
tell
you
,
and
you
see
how
*NL*
uninteresting
it
is
.
''
As
Dantes
spoke
,
Villefort
gazed
at
his
ingenuous
*NL*
and
open
countenance
,
and
recollected
the
words
of
Renee
,
who
,
without
*NL*
knowing
who
the
culprit
was
,
had
besought
his
indulgence
for
him
.
With
*NL*
the
deputy
's
knowledge
of
crime
and
criminals
,
every
word
the
young
man
*NL*
uttered
convinced
him
more
and
more
of
his
innocence
.
This
lad
,
for
he
*NL*
was
scarcely
a
man
,
--
simple
,
natural
,
eloquent
with
that
eloquence
of
*NL*
the
heart
never
found
when
sought
for
;
full
of
affection
for
everybody
,
*NL*
because
he
was
happy
,
and
because
happiness
renders
even
the
wicked
*NL*
good
--
extended
his
affection
even
to
his
judge
,
spite
of
Villefort
's
*NL*
severe
look
and
stern
accent
.
Dantes
seemed
full
of
kindness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pardieu
,
''
said
Villefort
,
``
he
is
a
noble
fellow
.
I
hope
I
shall
gain
*NL*
Renee
's
favor
easily
by
obeying
the
first
command
she
ever
imposed
on
*NL*
me
.
I
shall
have
at
least
a
pressure
of
the
hand
in
public
,
and
a
sweet
*NL*
kiss
in
private
.
''
Full
of
this
idea
,
Villefort
's
face
became
so
joyous
,
*NL*
that
when
he
turned
to
Dantes
,
the
latter
,
who
had
watched
the
change
on
*NL*
his
physiognomy
,
was
smiling
also
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
,
''
said
Villefort
,
``
have
you
any
enemies
,
at
least
,
that
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
enemies
?
''
replied
Dantes
;
``
my
position
is
not
sufficiently
*NL*
elevated
for
that
.
As
for
my
disposition
,
that
is
,
perhaps
,
somewhat
*NL*
too
hasty
;
but
I
have
striven
to
repress
it
.
I
have
had
ten
or
twelve
*NL*
sailors
under
me
,
and
if
you
question
them
,
they
will
tell
you
that
*NL*
they
love
and
respect
me
,
not
as
a
father
,
for
I
am
too
young
,
but
as
an
*NL*
elder
brother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
may
have
excited
jealousy
.
You
are
about
to
become
captain
at
*NL*
nineteen
--
an
elevated
post
;
you
are
about
to
marry
a
pretty
girl
,
who
*NL*
loves
you
;
and
these
two
pieces
of
good
fortune
may
have
excited
the
*NL*
envy
of
some
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
right
;
you
know
men
better
than
I
do
,
and
what
you
say
may
*NL*
possibly
be
the
case
,
I
confess
;
but
if
such
persons
are
among
my
*NL*
acquaintances
I
prefer
not
to
know
it
,
because
then
I
should
be
forced
*NL*
to
hate
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
wrong
;
you
should
always
strive
to
see
clearly
around
you
.
You
*NL*
seem
a
worthy
young
man
;
I
will
depart
from
the
strict
line
of
my
duty
*NL*
to
aid
you
in
discovering
the
author
of
this
accusation
.
Here
is
the
*NL*
paper
;
do
you
know
the
writing
?
''
As
he
spoke
,
Villefort
drew
the
letter
*NL*
from
his
pocket
,
and
presented
it
to
Dantes
.
Dantes
read
it
.
A
cloud
*NL*
passed
over
his
brow
as
he
said
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
monsieur
,
I
do
not
know
the
writing
,
and
yet
it
is
tolerably
plain
.
*NL*
Whoever
did
it
writes
well
.
I
am
very
fortunate
,
''
added
he
,
looking
*NL*
gratefully
at
Villefort
,
``
to
be
examined
by
such
a
man
as
you
;
for
this
*NL*
envious
person
is
a
real
enemy
.
''
And
by
the
rapid
glance
that
the
young
*NL*
man
's
eyes
shot
forth
,
Villefort
saw
how
much
energy
lay
hid
beneath
*NL*
this
mildness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
''
said
the
deputy
,
``
answer
me
frankly
,
not
as
a
prisoner
to
a
*NL*
judge
,
but
as
one
man
to
another
who
takes
an
interest
in
him
,
what
*NL*
truth
is
there
in
the
accusation
contained
in
this
anonymous
letter
?
''
*NL*
And
Villefort
threw
disdainfully
on
his
desk
the
letter
Dantes
had
just
*NL*
given
back
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
None
at
all

I
will
tell
you
the
real

love
for
Mercedes

by
the
life
of
my
father

--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Speak

monsieur

''
said
Villefort
.
Then
,
internally
,
``
If
Renee
could
*NL*
see
me
,
I
hope
she
would
be
satisfied

no

decapitator

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

when
we
quitted
Naples
,
Captain
Leclere
was
attacked
with
a
brain
*NL*
fever
.
As
we
had
no
doctor
on
board
,
and
he
was
so
anxious
to
arrive
at
*NL*
Elba
,
that
he
would
not
touch
at
any
other
port
,
his
disorder
rose
to
*NL*
such
a
height
,
that
at
the
end
of
the
third
day
,
feeling
he
was
dying
,
*NL*
he
called
me
to
him
.
`
My
dear
Dantes
,
'
said
he
,
`
swear
to
perform
what
I
*NL*
am
going
to
tell
you
,
for
it
is
a
matter
of
the
deepest
importance
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
''
'
I
swear
,
captain
,
'
replied
I.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Well
,
as
after
my
death
the
command
devolves
on
you
as
mate
,
*NL*
assume
the
command
,
and
bear
up
for
the
Island
of
Elba
,
disembark
at
*NL*
Porto-Ferrajo
,
ask
for
the
grand-marshal
,
give
him
this
letter
--
perhaps
*NL*
they
will
give
you
another
letter
,
and
charge
you
with
a
commission
.
You
*NL*
will
accomplish
what
I
was
to
have
done
,
and
derive
all
the
honor
and
*NL*
profit
from
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
''
'
I
will
do
it
,
captain
;
but
perhaps
I
shall
not
be
admitted
to
the
*NL*
grand
marshal
's
presence
as
easily
as
you
expect
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Here
is
a
ring
that
will
obtain
audience
of
him
,
and
remove
every
*NL*
difficulty
,
'
said
the
captain
.
At
these
words
he
gave
me
a
ring
.
It
was
*NL*
time
--
two
hours
after
he
was
delirious
;
the
next
day
he
died
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
did
you
do
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
I
ought
to
have
done
,
and
what
every
one
would
have
done
in
my
*NL*
place
.
Everywhere
the
last
requests
of
a
dying
man
are
sacred
;
but
with
*NL*
a
sailor
the
last
requests
of
his
superior
are
commands
.
I
sailed
for
*NL*
the
Island
of
Elba
,
where
I
arrived
the
next
day
;
I
ordered
everybody
*NL*
to
remain
on
board
,
and
went
on
shore
alone
.
As
I
had
expected
,
I
found
*NL*
some
difficulty
in
obtaining
access
to
the
grand-marshal
;
but
I
sent
the
*NL*
ring
I
had
received
from
the
captain
to
him
,
and
was
instantly
admitted
.
*NL*
He
questioned
me
concerning
Captain
Leclere
's
death
;
and
,
as
the
latter
*NL*
had
told
me
,
gave
me
a
letter
to
carry
on
to
a
person
in
Paris
.
I
*NL*
undertook
it
because
it
was
what
my
captain
had
bade
me
do
.
I
landed
*NL*
here
,
regulated
the
affairs
of
the
vessel
,
and
hastened
to
visit
my
*NL*
affianced
bride
,
whom
I
found
more
lovely
than
ever
.
Thanks
to
M.
*NL*
Morrel
,
all
the
forms
were
got
over
;
in
a
word
I
was
,
as
I
told
you
,
*NL*
at
my
marriage-feast
;
and
I
should
have
been
married
in
an
hour
,
and
*NL*
to-morrow
I
intended
to
start
for
Paris
,
had
I
not
been
arrested
on
this
*NL*
charge
which
you
as
well
as
I
now
see
to
be
unjust
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
said
Villefort
,
``
this
seems
to
me
the
truth
.
If
you
have
been
*NL*
culpable
,
it
was
imprudence
,
and
this
imprudence
was
in
obedience
to
the
*NL*
orders
of
your
captain
.
Give
up
this
letter
you
have
brought
from
Elba
,
*NL*
and
pass
your
word
you
will
appear
should
you
be
required
,
and
go
and
*NL*
rejoin
your
friends
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
free
,
then
,
sir
?
''
cried
Dantes
joyfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
but
first
give
me
this
letter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
it
already
,
for
it
was
taken
from
me
with
some
others
which
I
*NL*
see
in
that
packet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stop
a
moment
,
''
said
the
deputy
,
as
Dantes
took
his
hat
and
gloves
.
``
To
*NL*
whom
is
it
addressed
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
Monsieur
Noirtier
,
Rue
Coq-Heron

Paris

''
Had
a
thunderbolt
fallen
*NL*
into
the
room
,
Villefort
could
not
have
been
more
stupefied
.
He
sank
*NL*
into
his
seat
,
and
hastily
turning
over
the
packet
,
drew
forth
the
fatal
*NL*
letter
,
at
which
he
glanced
with
an
expression
of
terror
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
M.
Noirtier
,
Rue
Coq-Heron
,
No.

,
''
murmured
he
,
growing
still
paler
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Dantes
;
``
do
you
know
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
replied
Villefort
;
``
a
faithful
servant
of
the
king
does
not
know
*NL*
conspirators
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
conspiracy
,
then
?
''
asked
Dantes
,
who
after
believing
himself
*NL*
free
,
now
began
to
feel
a
tenfold
alarm
.
``
I
have
,
however
,
already
told
*NL*
you
,
sir
,
I
was
entirely
ignorant
of
the
contents
of
the
letter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
but
you
knew
the
name
of
the
person
to
whom
it
was
addressed
,
''
*NL*
said
Villefort
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
forced
to
read
the
address
to
know
to
whom
to
give
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
shown
this
letter
to
any
one
?
''
asked
Villefort
,
becoming
still
*NL*
more
pale
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
no
one
,
on
my
honor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Everybody
is
ignorant
that
you
are
the
bearer
of
a
letter
from
the
*NL*
Island
of
Elba
,

addressed
to
M.
Noirtier

*NL*
*NL*
``
Everybody

me

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
that
was
too
much
,
far
too
much
,
''
murmured
Villefort
.
Villefort
's
*NL*
brow
darkened
more
and
more
,
his
white
lips
and
clinched
teeth
filled
*NL*
Dantes
with
apprehension
.
After
reading
the
letter
,
Villefort
covered
*NL*
his
face
with
his
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
said
Dantes
timidly
,
``
what
is
the
matter
?
''
Villefort
made
no
*NL*
answer
,
but
raised
his
head
at
the
expiration
of
a
few
seconds
,
and
*NL*
again
perused
the
letter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
say
that
you
are
ignorant
of
the
contents
of
this
letter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
give
you
my
word
of
honor
,
sir
,
''
said
Dantes
;
``
but
what
is
the
*NL*
matter
?
You
are
ill
--
shall
I
ring
for
assistance
?
--
shall
I
call
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Villefort
,
rising
hastily
;
``
stay
where
you
are
.
It
is
for
me
*NL*
to
give
orders
here
,
and
not
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
,
''
replied
Dantes
proudly
,
``
it
was
only
to
summon
assistance
*NL*
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
none
;
it
was
a
temporary
indisposition
.
Attend
to
yourself
;
*NL*
answer
me
.
''
Dantes
waited
,
expecting
a
question
,
but
in
vain
.
Villefort
*NL*
fell
back
on
his
chair
,
passed
his
hand
over
his
brow
,
moist
with
*NL*
perspiration
,
and
,
for
the
third
time
,
read
the
letter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
if
he
knows
the
contents
of
this
!
''
murmured
he
,
``
and
that
Noirtier
*NL*
is
the
father
of
Villefort
,
I
am
lost
!
''
And
he
fixed
his
eyes
upon
*NL*
Edmond
as
if
he
would
have
penetrated
his
thoughts
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it
is
impossible
to
doubt
it
,
''
cried
he
,
suddenly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
heaven
's
name
!
''
cried
the
unhappy
young
man
,
``
if
you
doubt
me
,
*NL*
question
me
;
I
will
answer
you
.
''
Villefort
made
a
violent
effort
,
and
in
*NL*
a
tone
he
strove
to
render
firm
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
,
''
said
he
,
``
I
am
no
longer
able
,
as
I
had
hoped
,
to
restore
you
*NL*
immediately
to
liberty

before
doing
so
,
I
must
consult
the
trial
*NL*
justice
;
what
my
own
feeling
is
you
already
know

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
monsieur

cried
Dantes
,
``
you
have
been
rather
a
friend

a

judge

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

I
must
detain
you
some
time
longer
,
but
I
will
strive
to
make
it
*NL*
as
short
as
possible
.
The
principal
charge
against
you
is
this
letter
,
*NL*
and
you
see
''
--
Villefort
approached
the
fire
,
cast
it
in
,
and
waited
*NL*
until
it
was
entirely
consumed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
I
destroy
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
exclaimed
Dantes
,
``
you
are
goodness
itself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
,
''
continued
Villefort
;
``
you
can
now
have
confidence
in
me
after
*NL*
what
I
have
done
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
command
,
and
I
will
obey
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
;
this
is
not
a
command
,
but
advice
I
give
you
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Speak
,
and
I
will
follow
your
advice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
detain
you
until
this
evening
in
the
Palais
de
Justice
.
Should
*NL*
any
one
else
interrogate
you
,
say
to
him
what
you
have
said
to
me
,
but
*NL*
do
not
breathe
a
word
of
this
letter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
promise
.
''
It
was
Villefort
who
seemed
to
entreat
,
and
the
prisoner
*NL*
who
reassured
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
''
continued
he
,
glancing
toward
the
grate
,
where
fragments
of
*NL*
burnt
paper
fluttered
in
the
flames
,
``
the
letter
is
destroyed
;
you
and
I
*NL*
alone
know
of
its
existence
;
should
you
,
therefore
,
be
questioned
,
deny
*NL*
all
knowledge
of
it
--
deny
it
boldly
,
and
you
are
saved
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
satisfied
;
I
will
deny
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
the
only
letter
you
had
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Swear
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
swear
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Villefort
rang
.
A
police
agent
entered
.
Villefort
whispered
some
words
*NL*
in
his
ear
,
to
which
the
officer
replied
by
a
motion
of
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Follow
him
,
''
said
Villefort
to
Dantes
.
Dantes
saluted
Villefort
*NL*
and
retired
.
Hardly
had
the
door
closed
when
Villefort
threw
himself
*NL*
half-fainting
into
a
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas
,
alas
,
''
murmured
he
,
``
if
the
procureur
himself
had
been
at
*NL*
Marseilles
I
should
have
been
ruined
.
This
accursed
letter
would
have
*NL*
destroyed
all
my
hopes
.
Oh
,
my
father
,
must
your
past
career
always
*NL*
interfere
with
my
successes
?
''
Suddenly
a
light
passed
over
his
face
,
*NL*
a
smile
played
round
his
set
mouth
,
and
his
haggard
eyes
were
fixed
in
*NL*
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
will
do
,
''
said
he
,
``
and
from
this
letter
,
which
might
have
ruined
*NL*
me
,
I
will
make
my
fortune
.
Now
to
the
work
I
have
in
hand
.
''
And
after
*NL*
having
assured
himself
that
the
prisoner
was
gone
,
the
deputy
procureur
*NL*
hastened
to
the
house
of
his
betrothed

Chapter
8
.
The
Chateau
D'If
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
commissary
of
police
,
as
he
traversed
the
ante-chamber
,
made
a
sign
*NL*
to
two
gendarmes
,
who
placed
themselves
one
on
Dantes
'
right
and
the
*NL*
other
on
his
left
.
A
door
that
communicated
with
the
Palais
de
Justice
*NL*
was
opened
,
and
they
went
through
a
long
range
of
gloomy
corridors
,
*NL*
whose
appearance
might
have
made
even
the
boldest
shudder
.
The
Palais
de
*NL*
Justice
communicated
with
the
prison
,
--
a
sombre
edifice
,
that
from
*NL*
its
grated
windows
looks
on
the
clock-tower
of
the
Accoules
.
After
*NL*
numberless
windings
,
Dantes
saw
a
door
with
an
iron
wicket
.
The
*NL*
commissary
took
up
an
iron
mallet
and
knocked
thrice
,
every
blow
seeming
*NL*
to
Dantes
as
if
struck
on
his
heart
.
The
door
opened
,
the
two
gendarmes
*NL*
gently
pushed
him
forward
,
and
the
door
closed
with
a
loud
sound
behind
*NL*
him
.
The
air
he
inhaled
was
no
longer
pure
,
but
thick
and
mephitic
,
--
he
*NL*
was
in
prison
.
He
was
conducted
to
a
tolerably
neat
chamber
,
but
grated
*NL*
and
barred
,
and
its
appearance
,
therefore
,
did
not
greatly
alarm
him
;
*NL*
besides
,
the
words
of
Villefort
,
who
seemed
to
interest
himself
so
*NL*
much
,
resounded
still
in
his
ears
like
a
promise
of
freedom
.
It
was
four
*NL*
o'clock
when
Dantes
was
placed
in
this
chamber
.
It
was
,
as
we
have
said
,
*NL*
the
1st
of
March
,
and
the
prisoner
was
soon
buried
in
darkness
.
The
*NL*
obscurity
augmented
the
acuteness
of
his
hearing
;
at
the
slightest
sound
*NL*
he
rose
and
hastened
to
the
door
,
convinced
they
were
about
to
liberate
*NL*
him
,
but
the
sound
died
away
,
and
Dantes
sank
again
into
his
seat
.
At
*NL*
last
,
about
ten
o'clock
,
and
just
as
Dantes
began
to
despair
,
steps
were
*NL*
heard
in
the
corridor
,
a
key
turned
in
the
lock
,
the
bolts
creaked
,
*NL*
the
massy
oaken
door
flew
open
,
and
a
flood
of
light
from
two
torches
*NL*
pervaded
the
apartment
.
By
the
torchlight
Dantes
saw
the
glittering
*NL*
sabres
and
carbines
of
four
gendarmes
.
He
had
advanced
at
first
,
but
*NL*
stopped
at
the
sight
of
this
display
of
force
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
come
to
fetch
me
?
''
asked
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
replied
a
gendarme
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
the
orders
of
the
deputy
procureur
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
so
.
''
The
conviction
that
they
came
from
M.
de
Villefort
*NL*
relieved
all
Dantes
'
apprehensions
;
he
advanced
calmly
,
and
placed
*NL*
himself
in
the
centre
of
the
escort
.
A
carriage
waited
at
the
door
,
the
*NL*
coachman
was
on
the
box
,
and
a
police
officer
sat
beside
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
this
carriage
for
me
?
''
said
Dantes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
for
you
,
''
replied
a
gendarme
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dantes
was
about
to
speak
;
but
feeling
himself
urged
forward
,
and
having
*NL*
neither
the
power
nor
the
intention
to
resist
,
he
mounted
the
steps
,
and
*NL*
was
in
an
instant
seated
inside
between
two
gendarmes
;
the
two
others
*NL*
took
their
places
opposite
,
and
the
carriage
rolled
heavily
over
the
*NL*
stones
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prisoner
glanced
at
the
windows
--
they
were
grated
;
he
had
changed
*NL*
his
prison
for
another
that
was
conveying
him
he
knew
not
whither
.
*NL*
Through
the
grating
,
however
,
Dantes
saw
they
were
passing
through
the
*NL*
Rue
Caisserie
,
and
by
the
Rue
Saint-Laurent
and
the
Rue
Taramis
,
to
the
*NL*
port
.
Soon
he
saw
the
lights
of
La
Consigne
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
carriage
stopped
,
the
officer
descended
,
approached
the
guardhouse
,
*NL*
a
dozen
soldiers
came
out
and
formed
themselves
in
order
;
Dantes
saw
the
*NL*
reflection
of
their
muskets
by
the
light
of
the
lamps
on
the
quay
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
all
this
force
be
summoned
on
my
account
?
''
thought
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
officer
opened
the
door
,
which
was
locked
,
and
,
without
speaking
*NL*
a
word
,
answered
Dantes
'
question
;
for
he
saw
between
the
ranks
of
*NL*
the
soldiers
a
passage
formed
from
the
carriage
to
the
port
.
The
two
*NL*
gendarmes
who
were
opposite
to
him
descended
first
,
then
he
was
ordered
*NL*
to
alight
and
the
gendarmes
on
each
side
of
him
followed
his
example
.
*NL*
They
advanced
towards
a
boat
,
which
a
custom-house
officer
held
by
a
*NL*
chain
,
near
the
quay
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
soldiers
looked
at
Dantes
with
an
air
of
stupid
curiosity
.
In
an
*NL*
instant
he
was
placed
in
the
stern-sheets
of
the
boat
,
between
the
*NL*
gendarmes
,
while
the
officer
stationed
himself
at
the
bow
;
a
shove
sent
*NL*
the
boat
adrift
,
and
four
sturdy
oarsmen
impelled
it
rapidly
towards
the
*NL*
Pilon
.
At
a
shout
from
the
boat
,
the
chain
that
closes
the
mouth
of
*NL*
the
port
was
lowered
and
in
a
second
they
were
,
as
Dantes
knew
,
in
the
*NL*
Frioul
and
outside
the
inner
harbor
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prisoner
's
first
feeling
was
of
joy
at
again
breathing
the
pure
*NL*
air
--
for
air
is
freedom
;
but
he
soon
sighed
,
for
he
passed
before
La
*NL*
Reserve
,
where
he
had
that
morning
been
so
happy
,
and
now
through
the
*NL*
open
windows
came
the
laughter
and
revelry
of
a
ball
.
Dantes
folded
his
*NL*
hands
,
raised
his
eyes
to
heaven
,
and
prayed
fervently
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
boat
continued
her
voyage
.
They
had
passed
the
Tete
de
Morte
,
*NL*
were
now
off
the
Anse
du
Pharo
,
and
about
to
double
the
battery
.
This
*NL*
manoeuvre
was
incomprehensible
to
Dantes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whither
are
you
taking
me
?
''
asked
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
soon
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
still
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
forbidden
to
give
you
any
explanation
.
''
Dantes
,
trained
in
*NL*
discipline
,
knew
that
nothing
would
be
more
absurd
than
to
question
*NL*
subordinates
,
who
were
forbidden
to
reply
;
and
so
he
remained
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
most
vague
and
wild
thoughts
passed
through
his
mind
.
The
boat
they
*NL*
were
in
could
not
make
a
long
voyage
;
there
was
no
vessel
at
anchor
*NL*
outside
the
harbor
;
he
thought
,
perhaps
,
they
were
going
to
leave
him
on
*NL*
some
distant
point
.
He
was
not
bound
,
nor
had
they
made
any
attempt
to
*NL*
handcuff
him
;
this
seemed
a
good
augury
.
Besides
,
had
not
the
deputy
,
*NL*
who
had
been
so
kind
to
him
,
told
him
that
provided
he
did
not
pronounce
*NL*
the
dreaded
name
of
Noirtier
,
he
had
nothing
to
apprehend
?
Had
not
*NL*
Villefort
in
his
presence
destroyed
the
fatal
letter
,
the
only
proof
*NL*
against
him
?
*NL*
*NL*
He
waited
silently
,
striving
to
pierce
through
the
darkness
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
left
the
Ile
Ratonneau
,
where
the
lighthouse
stood
,
on
the
*NL*
right
,
and
were
now
opposite
the
Point
des
Catalans
.
It
seemed
to
the
*NL*
prisoner
that
he
could
distinguish
a
feminine
form
on
the
beach
,
for
it
*NL*
was
there
Mercedes
dwelt
.
How
was
it
that
a
presentiment
did
not
warn
*NL*
Mercedes
that
her
lover
was
within
three
hundred
yards
of
her
?
*NL*
*NL*
One
light
alone
was
visible
;
and
Dantes
saw
that
it
came
from
Mercedes
'
*NL*
chamber
.
Mercedes
was
the
only
one
awake
in
the
whole
settlement
.
A
loud
*NL*
cry
could
be
heard
by
her
.
But
pride
restrained
him
and
he
did
not
utter
*NL*
it
.
What
would
his
guards
think
if
they
heard
him
shout
like
a
madman
?
*NL*
*NL*
He
remained
silent
,
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
light
;
the
boat
went
on
,
but
*NL*
the
prisoner
thought
only
of
Mercedes
.
An
intervening
elevation
of
land
*NL*
hid
the
light
.
Dantes
turned
and
perceived
that
they
had
got
out
to
sea
.
*NL*
While
he
had
been
absorbed
in
thought
,
they
had
shipped
their
oars
and
*NL*
hoisted
sail
;
the
boat
was
now
moving
with
the
wind
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
spite
of
his
repugnance
to
address
the
guards
,
Dantes
turned
to
the
*NL*
nearest
gendarme
,
and
taking
his
hand
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Comrade
,
''
said
he
,
``
I
adjure
you
,
as
a
Christian
and
a
soldier
,
to
tell
*NL*
me
where
we
are
going
.
I
am
Captain
Dantes
,
a
loyal
Frenchman
,
thought
*NL*
accused
of
treason
;
tell
me
where
you
are
conducting
me
,
and
I
promise
*NL*
you
on
my
honor
I
will
submit
to
my
fate
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
gendarme
looked
irresolutely
at
his
companion
,
who
returned
for
*NL*
answer
a
sign
that
said
,
``
I
see
no
great
harm
in
telling
him
now
,
''
and
*NL*
the
gendarme
replied
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
a
native
of
Marseilles
,
and
a
sailor
,
and
yet
you
do
not
know
*NL*
where
you
are
going
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
my
honor
,
I
have
no
idea
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
no
idea
whatever
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
None
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
impossible
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
swear
to
you
it
is
true
.
Tell
me
,
I
entreat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
my
orders
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
orders
do
not
forbid
your
telling
me
what
I
must
know
in
ten
*NL*
minutes
,
in
half
an
hour
,
or
an
hour
.
You
see
I
can
not
escape
,
even
if
I
*NL*
intended
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Unless
you
are
blind
,
or
have
never
been
outside
the
harbor
,
you
must
*NL*
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
round
you
then
.
''
Dantes
rose
and
looked
forward
,
when
he
saw
*NL*
rise
within
a
hundred
yards
of
him
the
black
and
frowning
rock
on
which
*NL*
stands
the
Chateau
d'If
.
This
gloomy
fortress
,
which
has
for
more
than
*NL*
three
hundred
years
furnished
food
for
so
many
wild
legends
,
seemed
to
*NL*
Dantes
like
a
scaffold
to
a
malefactor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Chateau
d'If
?
''
cried
he
,
``
what
are
we
going
there
for
?
''
The
*NL*
gendarme
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
going
there
to
be
imprisoned
,
''
said
Dantes
;
``
it
is
only
*NL*
used
for
political
prisoners
.
I
have
committed
no
crime
.
Are
there
any
*NL*
magistrates
or
judges
at
the
Chateau
d'If
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
only
,
''
said
the
gendarme
,
``
a
governor
,
a
garrison
,
turnkeys
,
*NL*
and
good
thick
walls
.
Come
,
come
,
do
not
look
so
astonished
,
or
you
*NL*
will
make
me
think
you
are
laughing
at
me
in
return
for
my
good
nature
.
''
*NL*
Dantes
pressed
the
gendarme
's
hand
as
though
he
would
crush
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
think
,
then
,
''
said
he
,
``
that
I
am
taken
to
the
Chateau
d'If
to
be
*NL*
imprisoned
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
probable
;
but
there
is
no
occasion
to
squeeze
so
hard
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Without
any
inquiry
,
without
any
formality
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
the
formalities
have
been
gone
through
;
the
inquiry
is
already
*NL*
made
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
so
,
in
spite
of
M.
de
Villefort
's
promises
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
know
what
M.
de
Villefort
promised
you
,
''
said
the
gendarme
,
*NL*
``
but
I
know
we
are
taking
you
to
the
Chateau
d'If
.
But
what
are
you
*NL*
doing
?
Help
,
comrades
,
help
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
By
a
rapid
movement
,
which
the
gendarme
's
practiced
eye
had
perceived
,
*NL*
Dantes
sprang
forward
to
precipitate
himself
into
the
sea
;
but
four
*NL*
vigorous
arms
seized
him
as
his
feet
quitted
the
bottom
of
the
boat
.
He
*NL*
fell
back
cursing
with
rage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
!
''
said
the
gendarme
,
placing
his
knee
on
his
chest
;
``
believe
*NL*
soft-spoken
gentlemen
again
!
Harkye
,
my
friend
,
I
have
disobeyed
my
*NL*
first
order
,
but
I
will
not
disobey
the
second
;
and
if
you
move
,
I
will
*NL*
blow
your
brains
out
.
''
And
he
levelled
his
carbine
at
Dantes
,
who
felt
*NL*
the
muzzle
against
his
temple
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
moment
the
idea
of
struggling
crossed
his
mind
,
and
of
so
ending
*NL*
the
unexpected
evil
that
had
overtaken
him
.
But
he
bethought
him
of
M.
*NL*
de
Villefort
's
promise
;
and
,
besides
,
death
in
a
boat
from
the
hand
of
*NL*
a
gendarme
seemed
too
terrible
.
He
remained
motionless
,
but
gnashing
his
*NL*
teeth
and
wringing
his
hands
with
fury
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
moment
the
boat
came
to
a
landing
with
a
violent
shock
.
One
of
*NL*
the
sailors
leaped
on
shore
,
a
cord
creaked
as
it
ran
through
a
pulley
,
*NL*
and
Dantes
guessed
they
were
at
the
end
of
the
voyage
,
and
that
they
*NL*
were
mooring
the
boat
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
guards
,
taking
him
by
the
arms
and
coat-collar
,
forced
him
to
rise
,
*NL*
and
dragged
him
towards
the
steps
that
lead
to
the
gate
of
the
fortress
,
*NL*
while
the
police
officer
carrying
a
musket
with
fixed
bayonet
followed
*NL*
behind
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dantes
made
no
resistance
;
he
was
like
a
man
in
a
dream
:
he
saw
soldiers
*NL*
drawn
up
on
the
embankment
;
he
knew
vaguely
that
he
was
ascending
a
*NL*
flight
of
steps
;
he
was
conscious
that
he
passed
through
a
door
,
and
*NL*
that
the
door
closed
behind
him
;
but
all
this
indistinctly
as
through
*NL*
a
mist
.
He
did
not
even
see
the
ocean
,
that
terrible
barrier
against
*NL*
freedom
,
which
the
prisoners
look
upon
with
utter
despair
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
halted
for
a
minute
,
during
which
he
strove
to
collect
his
*NL*
thoughts
.
He
looked
around
;
he
was
in
a
court
surrounded
by
high
walls
;
*NL*
he
heard
the
measured
tread
of
sentinels
,
and
as
they
passed
before
the
*NL*
light
he
saw
the
barrels
of
their
muskets
shine
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
waited
upwards
of
ten
minutes
.
Certain
Dantes
could
not
escape
,
the
*NL*
gendarmes
released
him
.
They
seemed
awaiting
orders
.
The
orders
came
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
is
the
prisoner
?
''
said
a
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
,
''
replied
the
gendarmes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
him
follow
me
;
I
will
take
him
to
his
cell
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
!
''
said
the
gendarmes
,
thrusting
Dantes
forward
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prisoner
followed
his
guide
,
who
led
him
into
a
room
almost
under
*NL*
ground
,
whose
bare
and
reeking
walls
seemed
as
though
impregnated
with
*NL*
tears
;
a
lamp
placed
on
a
stool
illumined
the
apartment
faintly
,
*NL*
and
showed
Dantes
the
features
of
his
conductor
,
an
under-jailer
,
*NL*
ill-clothed
,
and
of
sullen
appearance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
is
your
chamber
for
to-night
,
''
said
he
.
``
It
is
late
,
and
the
*NL*
governor
is
asleep
.
To-morrow
,
perhaps
,
he
may
change
you
.
In
the
*NL*
meantime
there
is
bread
,
water
,
and
fresh
straw
;
and
that
is
all
a
*NL*
prisoner
can
wish
for
.
Goodnight
.
''
And
before
Dantes
could
open
his
*NL*
mouth
--
before
he
had
noticed
where
the
jailer
placed
his
bread
or
the
*NL*
water
--
before
he
had
glanced
towards
the
corner
where
the
straw
was
,
*NL*
the
jailer
disappeared
,
taking
with
him
the
lamp
and
closing
the
door
,
*NL*
leaving
stamped
upon
the
prisoner
's
mind
the
dim
reflection
of
the
*NL*
dripping
walls
of
his
dungeon
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dantes
was
alone
in
darkness
and
in
silence
--
cold
as
the
shadows
that
*NL*
he
felt
breathe
on
his
burning
forehead
.
With
the
first
dawn
of
day
the
*NL*
jailer
returned
,
with
orders
to
leave
Dantes
where
he
was
.
He
found
the
*NL*
prisoner
in
the
same
position
,
as
if
fixed
there
,
his
eyes
swollen
with
*NL*
weeping
.
He
had
passed
the
night
standing
,
and
without
sleep
.
The
jailer
*NL*
advanced
;
Dantes
appeared
not
to
perceive
him
.
He
touched
him
on
the
*NL*
shoulder
.
Edmond
started
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
not
slept
?
''
said
the
jailer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
know
,
''
replied
Dantes
.
The
jailer
stared
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
hungry
?
''
continued
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
wish
for
anything
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
to
see
the
governor
.
''
The
jailer
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
left
*NL*
the
chamber
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dantes
followed
him
with
his
eyes
,
and
stretched
forth
his
hands
towards
*NL*
the
open
door
;
but
the
door
closed
.
All
his
emotion
then
burst
forth
;
*NL*
he
cast
himself
on
the
ground
,
weeping
bitterly
,
and
asking
himself
what
*NL*
crime
he
had
committed
that
he
was
thus
punished
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
day
passed
thus
;
he
scarcely
tasted
food
,
but
walked
round
and
*NL*
round
the
cell
like
a
wild
beast
in
its
cage
.
One
thought
in
particular
*NL*
tormented
him
:
namely
,
that
during
his
journey
hither
he
had
sat
so
*NL*
still
,
whereas
he
might
,
a
dozen
times
,
have
plunged
into
the
sea
,
and
,
*NL*
thanks
to
his
powers
of
swimming
,
for
which
he
was
famous
,
have
gained
*NL*
the
shore
,
concealed
himself
until
the
arrival
of
a
Genoese
or
Spanish
*NL*
vessel
,
escaped
to
Spain
or
Italy
,
where
Mercedes
and
his
father
could
*NL*
have
joined
him
.
He
had
no
fears
as
to
how
he
should
live
--
good
seamen
*NL*
are
welcome
everywhere
.
He
spoke
Italian
like
a
Tuscan
,
and
Spanish
like
*NL*
a
Castilian
;
he
would
have
been
free
,
and
happy
with
Mercedes
and
*NL*
his
father
,
whereas
he
was
now
confined
in
the
Chateau
d'If
,
that
*NL*
impregnable
fortress
,
ignorant
of
the
future
destiny
of
his
father
and
*NL*
Mercedes
;
and
all
this
because
he
had
trusted
to
Villefort
's
promise
.
*NL*
The
thought
was
maddening
,
and
Dantes
threw
himself
furiously
down
on
*NL*
his
straw
.
The
next
morning
at
the
same
hour
,
the
jailer
came
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
the
jailer
,
``
are
you
more
reasonable
to-day
?
''
Dantes
made
*NL*
no
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
cheer
up
;
is
there
anything
that
I
can
do
for
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
to
see
the
governor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
already
told
you
it
was
impossible
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
it
is
against
prison
rules
,
and
prisoners
must
not
even
ask
for
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
allowed
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Better
fare
,
if
you
pay
for
it
,
books
,
and
leave
to
walk
about
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
want
books
,
I
am
satisfied
with
my
food
,
and
do
not
care
to
*NL*
walk
about
;
but
I
wish
to
see
the
governor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
worry
me
by
repeating
the
same
thing
,
I
will
not
bring
you
any
*NL*
more
to
eat

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
''
said
Edmond
,
``
if
you
do
not
,
I
shall
die
of
hunger
--
that
*NL*
is
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
jailer
saw
by
his
tone
he
would
be
happy
to
die
;
and
as
every
*NL*
prisoner
is
worth
ten
sous
a
day
to
his
jailer
,
he
replied
in
a
more
*NL*
subdued
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
you
ask
is
impossible
;
but
if
you
are
very
well
behaved
you
will
*NL*
be
allowed
to
walk
about
,
and
some
day
you
will
meet
the
governor
,
and
*NL*
if
he
chooses
to
reply
,
that
is
his
affair
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
''
asked
Dantes
,
``
how
long
shall
I
have
to
wait
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

a
month

six
months

a

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
too
long
a

I
wish
to
see
him
at
once

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
said
the
jailer
,
``
do
not
always
brood
over
what
is
impossible

*NL*
you
will
be
mad
in
a
fortnight

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
think
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
we
have
an
instance
here
;
it
was
by
always
offering
a
million
of
*NL*
francs
to
the
governor
for
his
liberty
that
an
abbe
became
mad
,
who
was
*NL*
in
this
chamber
before
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
How
long
has
he
left
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
Two

*NL*

Was
he
liberated

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

was
put
in

*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
!

said
Dantes
.
``
I
am
not
an
abbe

I
am
not
mad

perhaps
I
shall
*NL*
be
,

at

,
unfortunately
,
I
am
not

I
will
make
you
another

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
that

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not

I

seek
out

*NL*
*NL*
``
If

were
detected

a

be

great
fool

run
such
a
risk
for
three
hundred

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

''
said
Dantes
,
``
mark
this
;
if
you
refuse
at

to
tell

am
here

I
will
some

hide
myself
behind
the
door

when

enter
I
will
dash
out
your
brains
with
this
stool

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Threats
!
''
cried
the
jailer
,
retreating
and
putting
himself
on
the
*NL*
defensive
;
``
you
are
certainly
going
mad
.
The
abbe
began
like
you
,
and
in
*NL*
three
days
you
will
be
like
him
,
mad
enough
to
tie
up
;
but
,
fortunately
,
*NL*
there
are
dungeons
here
.
''
Dantes
whirled
the
stool
round
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
all
right
,
''
said
the
jailer
;
``
all
right
,
since
you
will
have
*NL*
it
so
.
I
will
send
word
to
the
governor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
''
returned
Dantes
,
dropping
the
stool
and
sitting
on
it
as
if
*NL*
he
were
in
reality
mad
.
The
jailer
went
out
,
and
returned
in
an
instant
*NL*
with
a
corporal
and
four
soldiers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
the
governor
's
orders
,

said
he
,
``
conduct
the
prisoner
to
the
tier
*NL*
beneath
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
the
dungeon
,
then
,
''
said
the
corporal
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
we
must
put
the
madman
with
the
madmen
.
''
The
soldiers
seized
*NL*
Dantes
,
who
followed
passively
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
descended
fifteen
steps
,
and
the
door
of
a
dungeon
was
opened
,
and
*NL*
he
was
thrust
in
.
The
door
closed
,
and
Dantes
advanced
with
outstretched
*NL*
hands
until
he
touched
the
wall
;
he
then
sat
down
in
the
corner
until
*NL*
his
eyes
became
accustomed
to
the
darkness
.
The
jailer
was
right
;
Dantes
*NL*
wanted
but
little
of
being
utterly
mad
.

Chapter
9

The
Evening
of
the
Betrothal
.
*NL*
*NL*
Villefort
had
,
as
we
have
said
,
hastened
back
to
Madame
de
Saint-Meran
's
*NL*
in
the
Place
du
Grand
Cours
,
and
on
entering
the
house
found
that
the
*NL*
guests
whom
he
had
left
at
table
were
taking
coffee
in
the
salon
.
Renee
*NL*
was
,
with
all
the
rest
of
the
company
,
anxiously
awaiting
him
,
and
his
*NL*
entrance
was
followed
by
a
general
exclamation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Decapitator
,
Guardian
of
the
State

Royalist

Brutus

what
is

``
Speak

Terror

Corsican
ogre
broken
loose

cried
a
third
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Marquise

said
Villefort
,
approaching
his
future
mother-in-law
,
``
I
*NL*
request
your
pardon
for
thus
leaving
you

Will
the

honor

few
moments

private
conversation
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
it
is
really
a
serious
matter
,
then
?

asked
the
marquis
,
remarking
*NL*
the
cloud
on
Villefort
's
brow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
serious
that
I
must
take
leave
of
you
for
a
few
days
;
so

added
he
,
*NL*
turning
to
Renee
,
``
judge
for
yourself
if
it
be
not
important

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
going
to
leave
us

cried
Renee
,
unable
to
hide
her
emotion
at
*NL*
this
unexpected
announcement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas

returned
Villefort
,
``
I
must

*NL*
*NL*
``
Where

then

are
you
going

asked
the
marquise

*NL*
*NL*
``
That

mine

going
there
to-night

The
guests
looked
at
each
other

The
marquis
took
his
arm
,

*NL*
they
left
the
salon

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

asked
he

soon

they
were
by
themselves

down

The

rang
,
a
servant
entered

*NL*
Villefort
hastily
quitted
the
apartment
,
but
reflecting
that
the
sight
*NL*
of
the
deputy
procureur
running
through
the
streets
would
be
enough
to
*NL*
throw
the
whole
city
into
confusion
,
he
resumed
his
ordinary
pace
.
At
*NL*
his
door
he
perceived
a
figure
in
the
shadow
that
seemed
to
wait
for
*NL*
him
.
It
was
Mercedes
,
who
,
hearing
no
news
of
her
lover
,
had
come
*NL*
unobserved
to
inquire
after
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
Villefort
drew
near
,
she
advanced
and
stood
before
him
.
Dantes
had
*NL*
spoken
of
Mercedes
,
and
Villefort
instantly
recognized
her
.
Her
beauty
*NL*
and
high
bearing
surprised
him
,
and
when
she
inquired
what
had
become
of
*NL*
her
lover
,
it
seemed
to
him
that
she
was
the
judge
,
and
he
the
accused
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
young
man
you
speak
of
,
''
said
Villefort
abruptly
,
``
is
a
great
*NL*
criminal

and
I
can
do
nothing
for
him

mademoiselle
.
''
Mercedes
burst
*NL*
into
tears
,
and
,
as
Villefort
strove
to
pass
her
,
again
addressed
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
at
least
,
tell
me
where
he
is
,
that
I
may
know
whether
he
is
alive
*NL*
or
dead
,
''
said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
know
;
he
is
no
longer
in
my
hands
,
''
replied
Villefort
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
desirous
of
putting
an
end
to
the
interview
,
he
pushed
by
her
,
and
*NL*
closed
the
door
,
as
if
to
exclude
the
pain
he
felt
.
But
remorse
is
not
*NL*
thus
banished
;
like
Virgil
's
wounded
hero
,
he
carried
the
arrow
in
his
*NL*
wound
,
and
,
arrived
at
the
salon
,
Villefort
uttered
a
sigh
that
was
*NL*
almost
a
sob
,
and
sank
into
a
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
the
first
pangs
of
an
unending
torture
seized
upon
his
heart
.
The
*NL*
man
he
sacrificed
to
his
ambition
,
that
innocent
victim
immolated
on
*NL*
the
altar
of
his
father
's
faults
,
appeared
to
him
pale
and
threatening
,
*NL*
leading
his
affianced
bride
by
the
hand
,
and
bringing
with
him
remorse
,
*NL*
not
such
as
the
ancients
figured
,
furious
and
terrible
,
but
that
slow
*NL*
and
consuming
agony
whose
pangs
are
intensified
from
hour
to
hour
up
*NL*
to
the
very
moment
of
death
.
Then
he
had
a
moment
's
hesitation
.
He
had
*NL*
frequently
called
for
capital
punishment
on
criminals
,
and
owing
to
his
*NL*
irresistible
eloquence
they
had
been
condemned
,
and
yet
the
slightest
*NL*
shadow
of
remorse
had
never
clouded
Villefort
's
brow
,
because
they
were
*NL*
guilty
;
at
least
,
he
believed
so
;
but
here
was
an
innocent
man
whose
*NL*
happiness
he
had
destroyed
:
in
this
case
he
was
not
the
judge
,
but
the
*NL*
executioner
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
thus
reflected
,
he
felt
the
sensation
we
have
described
,
and
which
*NL*
had
hitherto
been
unknown
to
him
,
arise
in
his
bosom
,
and
fill
him
*NL*
with
vague
apprehensions
.
It
is
thus
that
a
wounded
man
trembles
*NL*
instinctively
at
the
approach
of
the
finger
to
his
wound
until
it
be
*NL*
healed
,
but
Villefort
's
was
one
of
those
that
never
close
,
or
if
they
*NL*
do
,
only
close
to
reopen
more
agonizing
than
ever
.
If
at
this
moment
the
*NL*
sweet
voice
of
Renee
had
sounded
in
his
ears
pleading
for
mercy
,
or
the
*NL*
fair
Mercedes
had
entered
and
said
,
``
In
the
name
of
God
,
I
conjure
you
*NL*
to
restore
me
my
affianced
husband
,
''
his
cold
and
trembling
hands
*NL*
would
have
signed
his
release
;
but
no
voice
broke
the
stillness
of
the
*NL*
chamber
,
and
the
door
was
opened
only
by
Villefort
's
valet
,
who
came
to
*NL*
tell
him
that
the
travelling
carriage
was
in
readiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Villefort
rose
,
or
rather
sprang
,
from
his
chair
,
hastily
opened
one
*NL*
of
the
drawers
of
his
desk
,
emptied
all
the
gold
it
contained
into
*NL*
his
pocket
,
stood
motionless
an
instant
,
his
hand
pressed
to
his
head
,
*NL*
muttered
a
few
inarticulate
sounds
,
and
then
,
perceiving
that
his
*NL*
servant
had
placed
his
cloak
on
his
shoulders
,
he
sprang
into
the
*NL*
carriage
,
ordering
the
postilions
to
drive
to
M.
de
Saint-Meran
's
.
The
*NL*
hapless
Dantes
was
doomed
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
marquis
had
promised
,
Villefort
found
the
marquise
and
Renee
*NL*
in
waiting
.
He
started
when
he
saw
Renee
,
for
he
fancied
she
was
again
*NL*
about
to
plead
for
Dantes
.
Alas
,
her
emotions
were
wholly
personal
:
she
*NL*
was
thinking
only
of
Villefort
's
departure
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
loved
Villefort
,
and
he
left
her
at
the
moment
he
was
about
to
*NL*
become
her
husband
.
Villefort
knew
not
when
he
should
return
,
and
Renee
,
*NL*
far
from
pleading
for
Dantes
,
hated
the
man
whose
crime
separated
her
*NL*
from
her
lover
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
what
of
Mercedes
?
She
had
met
Fernand
at
the
corner
of
the
Rue
*NL*
de
la
Loge
;
she
had
returned
to
the
Catalans
,
and
had
despairingly
cast
*NL*
herself
on
her
couch
.
Fernand
,
kneeling
by
her
side
,
took
her
hand
,
and
*NL*
covered
it
with
kisses
that
Mercedes
did
not
even
feel
.
She
passed
the
*NL*
night
thus
.
The
lamp
went
out
for
want
of
oil
,
but
she
paid
no
heed
to
*NL*
the
darkness
,
and
dawn
came
,
but
she
knew
not
that
it
was
day
.
Grief
had
*NL*
made
her
blind
to
all
but
one
object
--
that
was
Edmond
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
you
are
there
,
''
said
she
,
at
length
,
turning
towards
Fernand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
not
quitted
you
since
yesterday
,
''
returned
Fernand
sorrowfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Morrel
had
not
readily
given
up
the
fight
.
He
had
learned
that
Dantes
*NL*
had
been
taken
to
prison
,
and
he
had
gone
to
all
his
friends
,
and
*NL*
the
influential
persons
of
the
city
;
but
the
report
was
already
in
*NL*
circulation
that
Dantes
was
arrested
as
a
Bonapartist
agent
;
and
as
the
*NL*
most
sanguine
looked
upon
any
attempt
of
Napoleon
to
remount
the
throne
*NL*
as
impossible
,
he
met
with
nothing
but
refusal
,
and
had
returned
home
*NL*
in
despair
,
declaring
that
the
matter
was
serious
and
that
nothing
more
*NL*
could
be
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
Caderousse
was
equally
restless
and
uneasy
,
but
instead
of
seeking
,
like
*NL*
M.
Morrel
,
to
aid
Dantes
,
he
had
shut
himself
up
with
two
bottles
of
*NL*
black
currant
brandy
,
in
the
hope
of
drowning
reflection
.
But
he
did
not
*NL*
succeed
,
and
became
too
intoxicated
to
fetch
any
more
drink
,
and
yet
not
*NL*
so
intoxicated
as
to
forget
what
had
happened
.
With
his
elbows
on
the
*NL*
table
he
sat
between
the
two
empty
bottles
,
while
spectres
danced
in
the
*NL*
light
of
the
unsnuffed
candle
--
spectres
such
as
Hoffmann
strews
over
his
*NL*
punch-drenched
pages
,
like
black
,
fantastic
dust
.
*NL*
*NL*
Danglars
alone
was
content
and
joyous
--
he
had
got
rid
of
an
enemy
and
*NL*
made
his
own
situation
on
the
Pharaon
secure
.
Danglars
was
one
of
those
*NL*
men
born
with
a
pen
behind
the
ear
,
and
an
inkstand
in
place
of
a
heart
.
*NL*
Everything
with
him
was
multiplication
or
subtraction
.
The
life
of
a
man
*NL*
was
to
him
of
far
less
value
than
a
numeral
,
especially
when
,
by
taking
*NL*
it
away
,
he
could
increase
the
sum
total
of
his
own
desires
.
He
went
to
*NL*
bed
at
his
usual
hour
,
and
slept
in
peace
.
*NL*
*NL*
Villefort
,
after
having
received
M.
de
Salvieux
'
letter
,
embraced
Renee
,
*NL*
kissed
the
marquise
's
hand
,
and
shaken
that
of
the
marquis
,
started
for
*NL*
Paris
along
the
Aix
road
.
*NL*
*NL*
Old
Dantes
was
dying
with
anxiety
to
know
what
had
become
of
Edmond
.
But
*NL*
we
know
very
well
what
had
become
of
Edmond
.

The
King
's
Closet
at
the
Tuileries
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
will
leave
Villefort
on
the
road
to
Paris
,
travelling
--
thanks
*NL*
to
trebled
fees
--
with
all
speed
,
and
passing
through
two
or
three
*NL*
apartments
,
enter
at
the
Tuileries
the
little
room
with
the
arched
*NL*
window
,
so
well
known
as
having
been
the
favorite
closet
of
Napoleon
and
*NL*
Louis
XVIII.
,
and
now
of
Louis
Philippe
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
,
seated
before
a
walnut
table
he
had
brought
with
him
from
*NL*
Hartwell
,
and
to
which
,
from
one
of
those
fancies
not
uncommon
to
*NL*
great
people
,
he
was
particularly
attached
,
the
king
,
Louis
XVIII.
,
was
*NL*
carelessly
listening
to
a
man
of
fifty
or
fifty-two
years
of
age
,
with
*NL*
gray
hair
,
aristocratic
bearing
,
and
exceedingly
gentlemanly
attire
,
*NL*
and
meanwhile
making
a
marginal
note
in
a
volume
of
Gryphius
's
rather
*NL*
inaccurate
,
but
much
sought-after
,
edition
of
Horace
--
a
work
which
*NL*
was
much
indebted
to
the
sagacious
observations
of
the
philosophical
*NL*
monarch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
say
,
sir
''
--
said
the
king
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
I
am
exceedingly
disquieted
,
sire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
,
have
you
had
a
vision
of
the
seven
fat
kine
and
the
seven
lean
*NL*
kine
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sire
,
for
that
would
only
betoken
for
us
seven
years
of
plenty
and
*NL*
seven
years
of
scarcity
;
and
with
a
king
as
full
of
foresight
as
your
*NL*
majesty
,
scarcity
is
not
a
thing
to
be
feared
.

*NL*
``
Then
of

you
afraid

south

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

Louis
XVIII.

*NL*
*NL*
``

replied
the
king
,
continuing
the
annotations
in
his

Horace

*NL*
*NL*
``

replied
the
courtier
,
laughing
,
in
order
that
he
might
seem
*NL*
to
comprehend
the
quotation
,
``
your
majesty
may
be
perfectly
right
in

relying

good

*NL*
There
was
a
brief
pause
,
during
which
Louis
XVIII
.
wrote
,
in
a
hand
as
*NL*
small
as
possible
,
another
note
on
the
margin
of
his
Horace
,
and
then
*NL*
looking
at
the
duke
with
the
air
of
a
man

thinks
he
has
an
idea

his

is
only
commenting

the

attacked

as
delighted

``

Louis

laughing
;

*NL*
M.

pondered
deeply
between
the
confident

truthful

Villefort

not

reveal
the

lest

should
reap
all

communicated
enough
to
cause

the

*NL*
*NL*
``

Louis

``

The
minister
of
*NL*
police
bowed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
usurper

murmured
the
duke
,
looking
at
the
king

*NL*
Dandre

who
spoke
alternately
,
like
Virgil

shepherds

*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``

this
is
the
way

it

said
the
minister
,
with
the
gravest
air
in
*NL*
the
world
:
``
Napoleon
lately
had
a
review

two

expressed
a

gave

*NL*
``

the

pausing
for
a
moment
from

voluminous
scholiast
before
him

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

The

left
the
royal
presence
with
the
speed
of

a
young
man
;
his
really
sincere
royalism
made
him
youthful
again

Louis

XVIII

remained
alone
,
and
turning
his
eyes
on
his
half-opened
Horace
,
*NL*
muttered
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Justum
et
tenacem

*NL*
*NL*
M.
de
Blacas
returned
as
speedily
as
he
had
departed
,
but
in
the
*NL*
ante-chamber
he
was
forced
to
appeal
to
the
king
's
authority
.
*NL*
Villefort
's
dusty
garb
,
his
costume
,
which
was
not
of
courtly
cut
,
*NL*
excited
the
susceptibility
of
M.
de
Breze
,
who
was
all
astonishment
at
*NL*
finding
that
this
young
man
had
the
audacity
to
enter
before
the
king
*NL*
in
such
attire
.
The
duke
,
however
,
overcame
all
difficulties
with
a
*NL*
word
--
his
majesty
's
order
;
and
,
in
spite
of
the
protestations
which
the
*NL*
master
of
ceremonies
made
for
the
honor
of
his
office
and
principles
,
*NL*
Villefort
was
introduced
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
king
was
seated
in
the
same
place
where
the
duke
had
left
him
.
On
*NL*
opening
the
door
,
Villefort
found
himself
facing
him
,
and
the
young
*NL*
magistrate
's
first
impulse
was
to
pause
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
in
,
M.
de
Villefort

''
said
the
king
,
``
come
in

''
Villefort
bowed
,
*NL*
and
advancing
a
few
steps
,
waited
until
the
king
should
interrogate
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
M.

Villefort

said
Louis

as
I
am
asked
to
believe
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sire

I
believe
it
to
be
most
urgent

I
hope

by
the
speed
I
have
*NL*
used
,
that
it
is
not
irreparable

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Speak
as
fully
as
you
please
,
sir

said
the
king
,
who
began
to
give
*NL*
way
to
the
emotion
which
had
showed
itself
in
Blacas
's
face
and
affected
*NL*
Villefort
's
voice
.
``
Speak

pray
begin
at
the
beginning

I
like

everything

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
Villefort

I
must
entreat
your
forgiveness

to
some
*NL*
obscurity
in
my
language

''
A
glance
at
the
king
after
this
discreet
*NL*
and
subtle
exordium
,
assured
Villefort
of
the
benignity
of
his
august
*NL*
auditor
,
and
he
went
on
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``

exercise

my
duties

not
a
*NL*
commonplace

insignificant
plot

such
as
is
every
day
got
up
in
the
*NL*
lower
ranks
of

in

an

storm

menaces
no

the

usurper

arming
three
ships

he
meditates
some
project

which
,
however
*NL*
mad

is
yet
,
perhaps

terrible

At
this
moment
he
will
have
left
Elba

*NL*
to
go
whither
I
know
not
,
but
assuredly
to
attempt
a
landing
either
at
*NL*
Naples

or
on
the
coast
of
Tuscany

perhaps
on
the
shores
of
France

*NL*
Your
majesty
is
well
aware
that
the
sovereign

maintained
his
relations

France

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
the

much
agitated
;
``

recently

they

I
have
watched

some
time

arrested

This

I
suspected

has
been
secretly

There
he
saw

not
extract

left

M.
de

*NL*
*NL*
``
Sire
,
I
fear
it
is
more
than
a
plot
;
I
fear
it
is
a
conspiracy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
conspiracy
in
these
times
,
''
said
Louis
XVIII.
,
smiling
,
``
is
a
thing
*NL*
very
easy
to
meditate
,
but
more
difficult
to
conduct
to
an
end
,
inasmuch
*NL*
as
,
re-established
so
recently
on
the
throne
of
our
ancestors
,
we
have
*NL*
our
eyes
open
at
once
upon
the
past
,
the
present
,
and
the
future
.
For
*NL*
the
last
ten
months
my
ministers
have
redoubled
their
vigilance
,
in
*NL*
order
to
watch
the
shore
of
the
Mediterranean
.
If
Bonaparte
landed
at
*NL*
Naples
,
the
whole
coalition
would
be
on
foot
before
he
could
even
reach
*NL*
Piomoino
;
if
he
land
in
Tuscany
,
he
will
be
in
an
unfriendly
territory
;
*NL*
if
he
land
in
France
,
it
must
be
with
a
handful
of
men
,
and
the
result
*NL*
of
that
is
easily
foretold
,
execrated
as
he
is
by
the
population
.
Take
*NL*
courage
,
sir
;
but
at
the
same
time
rely
on
our
royal
gratitude
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
here
is
M.
Dandre
!
''
cried
de
Blacas
.
At
this
instant
the
minister
*NL*
of
police
appeared
at
the
door
,
pale
,
trembling
,
and
as
if
ready
to
*NL*
faint
.
Villefort
was
about
to
retire
,
but
M.
de
Blacas
,
taking
his
hand
,
*NL*
restrained
him

*NL*
At
the
sight
of
this
agitation
Louis
XVIII
.
pushed
from
him
violently
*NL*
the
table
at
which
he
was
sitting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
ails
you
,
baron
?
''
he
exclaimed
.
``
You
appear
quite
aghast

Has
your
*NL*
uneasiness
anything
to
do
with
what
M.
de
Blacas
has
told
me
,
and
M.
de
*NL*
Villefort
has
just
confirmed
?
''
M.
de
Blacas
moved
suddenly
towards
the
*NL*
baron
,
but
the
fright
of
the
courtier
pleaded
for
the
forbearance
of
*NL*
the
statesman
;
and
besides
,
as
matters
were
,
it
was
much
more
to
his
*NL*
advantage
that
the
prefect
of
police
should
triumph
over
him
than
that
*NL*
he
should
humiliate
the
prefect
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sire
''
--
stammered
the
baron
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
is
it
?
''
asked
Louis
XVIII
.
The
minister
of
police
,
giving
*NL*
way
to
an
impulse
of
despair
,
was
about
to
throw
himself
at
the
feet
of
*NL*
Louis
XVIII.
,
who
retreated
a
step
and
frowned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
speak

he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

Louis

``
I
command
you
to
speak

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

the
usurper
left
Elba
on

26th

1st
of

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
where

In

asked
the

eagerly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In

*NL*
*NL*
``
The

fifty
leagues
from

on
the
1st
of

you
only
*NL*
acquired
this
information
to-day

the
4th
of
March

Well
,
sir

what
you
*NL*
tell
me
is
impossible

You
must
have
received

gone
mad

*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas

it
is

too
true

Louis
made
a
gesture
of
indescribable
*NL*
anger
and
alarm
,
and
then
drew
himself
up
as
if
this
sudden
blow
had
*NL*
struck
him
at
the
same
moment
in
heart
and
countenance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In

he
cried
,
``

Then
they
did
not
watch
*NL*
over
this
man

Who

they
were
,
perhaps
,
in
league
with
him

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

exclaimed
the
Duc
de
Blacas
,
``
M.

not
a

Sire

we
have

the

*NL*
``
But

said
Villefort

then
suddenly
checking
himself

he
was

silent
;
then
he
continued
,
``
Your

he
said
,
bowing
,

*NL*
*NL*
``
Speak

boldly

Louis

*NL*
``
Sire

said
Villefort
,

detested
in

south

it

seems

me
that

south

it
would
be

raise
Languedoc

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

he

advancing

said
Louis

``
Is
he

advancing

Paris

The
minister
of
police
maintained
a
silence
which
was
equivalent
*NL*
to
a
complete
avowal
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
Dauphine
,
sir

inquired
the
king

of
Villefort

Do
you

I
am
sorry

tell

a
cruel
fact

the
feeling

in

quite
the
reverse
of
that
in
Provence

Languedoc

The
*NL*
mountaineers

Bonapartists

*NL*
*NL*
``
Then

Louis

``
he
was
well

And
how
many
men
had

with

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not

answered
the
minister

police
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What

you
do

you
neglected

point

Of

it
is
of
no

he
added
,
with
a
withering
*NL*
smile

*NL*
*NL*
``
Sire

it

overspread
his

stammered
out

``
By

Louis
XVIII

advanced
a
step
,
and
folded
his
*NL*
arms
over
his
chest
as
Napoleon
would
have
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
then
,
''
he
exclaimed
,
turning
pale
with
anger
,
``
seven
conjoined
and
*NL*
allied
armies
overthrew
that
man

A
miracle

heaven
replaced
me
on

the
throne
of
my
fathers
after
five-and-twenty
years
of
exile

I
have
,
*NL*
during
those
five-and-twenty
years
,
spared
no
pains
to
understand
the
*NL*
people
of
France
and
the
interests
which
were
confided
to
me
;
and
now
,
*NL*
when
I
see
the
fruition
of
my
wishes
almost
within
reach

the
power
I
*NL*
hold

bursts

shatters
me
to
atoms

*NL*
*NL*
``
Sire

murmured
the
minister
,
feeling
that
the
pressure
*NL*
of
circumstances
,
however
light
a
thing
to
destiny

was
too
much
for
any

human
strength

endure

*NL*
``
What

console
myself

to
be
in

persons
elevated
by
myself

places

honor

who
ought

watch
over

more
carefully

over
themselves

for
my

fortune
is
theirs

before
me

were
nothing

after
me
they
will
be

nothing

perish
miserably

incapacity

ineptitude

Oh

yes

*NL*
you
are
right

it
is
fatality

*NL*
*NL*
The
minister
quailed
before
this
outburst
of
sarcasm

M.
de
Blacas
wiped
*NL*
the
moisture
from
his
brow
.
Villefort
smiled
within
himself
,
for
he
felt
*NL*
his
increased
importance

*NL*
*NL*
``
To
fall

continued
King
Louis
,
who
at
the
first
glance
had
sounded
the
*NL*
abyss
on
which
the
monarchy
hung
suspended
,
--
``
to
fall
,
and
learn
of
that
*NL*
fall

would
rather
mount

thus
descend

ridicule

Ridicule

you

resumed
the
king
,
addressing
the
young
man
,
*NL*
who
,
motionless
and
breathless
,
was
listening
to
a
conversation
on
which
*NL*
depended
the
destiny
of
a
kingdom
.
``
Approach
,
and
tell
monsieur
that
it
*NL*
is
possible
to
know
beforehand
all
that
he
has
not
known

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sire
,
it
was
really
impossible
to
learn
secrets
which
that
man
*NL*
concealed
from
all
the
world

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
impossible

Yes

that
is
a
great
word

sir

Unfortunately
,
there
*NL*
are
great
words

as
there
are
great
men
;
I
have
measured
them

Really
*NL*
impossible
for
a
minister
who
has
an
office
,
agents
,
spies
,
and
fifteen
*NL*
hundred
thousand
francs
for
secret
service
money
,
to
know
what
is
going
*NL*
on
at
sixty
leagues
from
the
coast
of
France
!
Well
,
then
,
see
,
here
is
a
*NL*
gentleman
who
had
none
of
these
resources
at
his
disposal
--
a
gentleman
,
*NL*
only
a
simple
magistrate
,
who
learned
more
than
you
with
all
your
*NL*
police
,
and
who
would
have
saved
my
crown
,
if
,
like
you
,
he
had
the
*NL*
power
of
directing
a
telegraph
.
''
The
look
of
the
minister
of
police
was
*NL*
turned
with
concentrated
spite
on
Villefort
,
who
bent
his
head
in
modest
*NL*
triumph
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
mean
that
for
you
,
Blacas
,
''
continued
Louis
XVIII.
;
``
for
if
*NL*
you
have
discovered
nothing
,
at
least
you
have
had
the
good
sense
*NL*
to
persevere
in
your
suspicions
.
Any
other
than
yourself
would
have
*NL*
considered
the
disclosure
of
M.
de
Villefort
insignificant
,
or
else
*NL*
dictated
by
venal
ambition
,
''
These
words
were
an
allusion
to
the
*NL*
sentiments
which
the
minister
of
police
had
uttered
with
so
much
*NL*
confidence
an
hour
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
Villefort
understood
the
king
's
intent
.
Any
other
person
would
,
perhaps
,
*NL*
have
been
overcome
by
such
an
intoxicating
draught
of
praise
;
but
*NL*
he
feared
to
make
for
himself
a
mortal
enemy
of
the
police
minister
,
*NL*
although
he
saw
that
Dandre
was
irrevocably
lost
.
In
fact
,
the
*NL*
minister
,
who
,
in
the
plenitude
of
his
power
,
had
been
unable
to
unearth
*NL*
Napoleon
's
secret
,
might
in
despair
at
his
own
downfall
interrogate
*NL*
Dantes
and
so
lay
bare
the
motives
of
Villefort
's
plot
.
Realizing
this
,
*NL*
Villefort
came
to
the
rescue
of
the
crest-fallen
minister
,
instead
of
*NL*
aiding
to
crush
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sire
,
''
said
Villefort
,
``
the
suddenness
of
this
event
must
prove
to
your
*NL*
majesty
that
the
issue
is
in
the
hands
of
Providence
;
what
your
majesty
*NL*
is
pleased
to
attribute
to
me
as
profound
perspicacity
is
simply
owing
*NL*
to
chance
,
and
I
have
profited
by
that
chance
,
like
a
good
and
devoted
*NL*
servant
--
that
's
all
.
Do
not
attribute
to
me
more
than
I
deserve

*NL*
that
your
majesty
may
never
have
occasion

recall

have
been
pleased
to
form
of
me
.
''
The
minister
of
police
thanked
*NL*
the
young
man
by
an
eloquent
look
,
and
Villefort
understood
that
he
had
*NL*
succeeded
in
his
design
;
that
is
to
say
,
that
without
forfeiting
the
*NL*
gratitude
of
the
king
,
he
had
made
a
friend
of
one
on
whom
,
in
case
of
*NL*
necessity
,
he
might
rely
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
well
,

resumed
the
king
.
``
And
now
,
gentlemen

he
continued
,
*NL*
turning
towards
M.
de
Blacas
and
the
minister
of
police
,
``
I
have
no
*NL*
further
occasion
for
you

in

*NL*
*NL*
``
Fortunately

M.

``

exclaimed
Villefort

unable
to

repress
an
exclamation

Then

suddenly
pausing
,
he
added
,
``

the
right

*NL*
*NL*
``
Sire

''
interposed
the
minister
of
police
,
``
I
came
a
moment
ago
to
give
*NL*
your

fresh
information
which
I
had
obtained
on
this

when
*NL*
your
majesty

attention
was
attracted
by
the
terrible
event
that
has
*NL*
occurred
in
the
gulf
,

now
these

will
cease
to
interest
your
*NL*

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On

--
on
the
contrary

''
said
Louis
XVIII.
,
``
this
*NL*
affair
seems
to
me
to
have
a
decided
connection
with
that
which
occupies
*NL*
our
attention
,
and
the
death
of
General
Quesnel
will
,
perhaps
,
put
us
on
*NL*
the
direct
track
of
a
great
internal
conspiracy
.
''
At
the
name
of
General
*NL*
Quesnel
,
Villefort
trembled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Everything
points
to
the
conclusion
,
sire
,
''
said
the
minister
of
*NL*
police
,
``
that
death
was
not
the
result
of
suicide
,
as
we
first
believed
,
*NL*
but
of
assassination
.
General
Quesnel
,
it
appears
,
had
just
left
a
*NL*
Bonapartist
club
when
he
disappeared
.
An
unknown
person
had
been
*NL*
with
him
that
morning
,
and
made
an
appointment
with
him
in
the
Rue
*NL*
Saint-Jacques
;
unfortunately
,
the
general
's
valet
,
who
was
dressing
*NL*
his
hair
at
the
moment
when
the
stranger
entered
,
heard
the
street
*NL*
mentioned
,
but
did
not
catch
the
number
.
''
As
the
police
minister
related
*NL*
this
to
the
king
,
Villefort
,
who
looked
as
if
his
very
life
hung
on
the
*NL*
speaker
's
lips
,
turned
alternately
red
and
pale
.
The
king
looked
towards
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
not
think
with
me
,
M.
de
Villefort
,
that
General
Quesnel
,
whom
*NL*
they
believed
attached
to
the
usurper
,
but
who
was
really
entirely
*NL*
devoted
to
me
,
has
perished
the
victim
of
a
Bonapartist
ambush
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
probable
,
sire
,
''
replied
Villefort
.
``
But
is
this
all
that
is
*NL*
known
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
on
the
track
of
the
man
who
appointed
the
meeting
with
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
his
track
?
''
said
Villefort
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
the
servant
has
given
his
description

He
is
a
man
of
from
fifty
*NL*
to
fifty-two
years
of
age
,
dark
,
with
black
eyes
covered
with
shaggy
*NL*
eyebrows
,
and
a
thick
mustache
.
He
was
dressed
in
a
blue
frock-coat
,
*NL*
buttoned
up
to
the
chin
,
and
wore
at
his
button-hole
the
rosette
of
an
*NL*
officer
of
the
Legion
of
Honor
.
Yesterday
a
person
exactly
corresponding
*NL*
with
this
description
was
followed
,
but
he
was
lost
sight
of
at
the
*NL*
corner
of
the
Rue
de
la
Jussienne
and
the
Rue
Coq-Heron
.
''
Villefort
*NL*
leaned
on
the
back
of
an
arm-chair
,
for
as
the
minister
of
police
went
*NL*
on
speaking
he
felt
his
legs
bend
under
him
;
but
when
he
learned
that
*NL*
the
unknown
had
escaped
the
vigilance
of
the
agent
who
followed
him
,
he
*NL*
breathed
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Continue
to
seek
for
this
man
,
sir
,

said
the
king
to
the
minister
of
*NL*
police
;
``
for
if
,
as
I
am
all

convinced
,
General
Quesnel
,
who
*NL*
would
have
been
so
useful
to
us
at
this
moment
,
has
been
murdered
,
his
*NL*
assassins

Bonapartists
or
not

shall
be
cruelly
punished

''
It
required
*NL*
all
Villefort
's
coolness
not
to
betray
the
terror
with
which
this
*NL*
declaration
of
the
king
inspired
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
strange
,
''
continued
the
king
,
with
some
asperity
;
``
the
police
think
*NL*
that
they
have
disposed
of
the
whole
matter
when
they
say

A
murder
has

been
committed

and
especially
so
when
they
can
add

*NL*
*NL*
``

long
a
journey

go

Of
course
you
*NL*
stopped
at
your

''
A
feeling
of
faintness
came
over
Villefort
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

he
replied
,
``
I

said
Louis

smiling
in
a
manner
which
proved
that
all

these
questions
were
not
made
without
a
motive
;
``
I
forgot
you

*NL*
M.

that

recompensed

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
Never

-LRB-
the

here
detached
the
cross
of

usually
wore

Villefort

saluting
the

whose
career
was
ended

and
looking
about
him
for
a
hackney-coach
.
*NL*
One
passed
at
the
moment

which
he
hailed

he
gave
his
address
to
the

driver

springing
in
,
threw
himself
on
the
seat
,

gave
loose
to

dreams
of
ambition

*NL*
Ten
minutes
afterwards
Villefort
reached
his
hotel
,
ordered
horses
to
be
*NL*
ready
in
two
hours

and
asked
to
have
his
breakfast
brought
to

He
*NL*
was
about

begin
his
repast
when
the
sound
of
the
bell
rang
sharp
and
*NL*
loud
.
The
valet
opened
the
door
,

Villefort
heard
some
one
speak
his
*NL*
name

*NL*
*NL*
``

M.

looked
after

closed

then
,
fearing

no

that

he
opened

close

bolt

that
of

Yes

I
heard
this

knew
it
even
before
you
could

for
*NL*
three
days

I
posted
from
Marseilles
to

half-desperate
at
the
enforced
delay

*NL*
*NL*
``
Three
days

You
are
crazy

Why

three

ago
the
emperor
had
not
*NL*
landed

*NL*
*NL*

No

you
know

To

I
discovered

Had

that

Villefort

is

allow

*NL*

burnt

replied
Noirtier
;

yes

not

thus
designated

``
The
king
!
I
thought
he
was
philosopher
enough
to
allow

there
was

no
murder
in
politics

In
politics
,
my
dear
fellow

you
know
,
as
well
*NL*
as
I
do
,
there
are
no
men
,
but
ideas
--
no
feelings
,
but
interests
;
in
*NL*
politics
we
do
not
kill
a
man
,
we
only
remove
an
obstacle
,
that
is
all
.
*NL*
Would
you
like
to
know
how
matters
have
progressed
?
Well
,
I
will
tell
*NL*
you
.
It
was
thought
reliance
might
be
placed
in
General
Quesnel
;
he
was
*NL*
recommended
to
us
from
the
Island
of
Elba
;
one
of
us
went
to
him
,
and
*NL*
invited
him
to
the
Rue
Saint-Jacques
,
where
he
would
find
some
friends
.
*NL*
He
came
there
,
and
the
plan
was
unfolded
to
him
for
leaving
Elba
,
the
*NL*
projected
landing
,
etc.
.
When
he
had
heard
and
comprehended
all
to
the
*NL*
fullest
extent
,
he
replied
that
he
was
a
royalist
.
Then
all
looked
at
*NL*
each
other
,
--
he
was
made
to
take
an
oath
,
and
did
so
,
but
with
such
an
*NL*
ill
grace
that
it
was
really
tempting
Providence
to
swear
him
,
and
yet
,
*NL*
in
spite
of
that
,
the
general
was
allowed
to
depart
free
--
perfectly
*NL*
free
.
Yet
he
did
not
return
home
.
What
could
that
mean
?
why
,
my
dear
*NL*
fellow
,
that
on
leaving
us
he
lost
his
way
,
that
's
all
.
A
murder
?
*NL*
really
,
Villefort
,
you
surprise
me
.
You
,
a
deputy
procureur
,
to
found
*NL*
an
accusation
on
such
bad
premises
!
Did
I
ever
say
to
you
,
when
you
were
*NL*
fulfilling
your
character
as
a
royalist
,
and
cut
off
the
head
of
one
of
*NL*
my
party
,
`
My
son
,
you
have
committed
a
murder
?

No
,
I
said
,
`
Very
well

*NL*

have
gained
the
victory

to-morrow

it
will
be

*NL*
turn

*NL*
*NL*

But

your

boast
of
what
you

come
to
Paris
to
do

enter

your

inoffensive

for

act

my

go

my
dear
Gerard
,
and
by
your
obedience
to
my
paternal
orders
,
*NL*

,
if
you
prefer
it

friendly
counsels
,
we
will
keep
you
in
your

added
Noirtier
,
with
a
smile
,
``
one

you
*NL*
may
a
second

me

some

another

you
aloft

down

alight

''
Noirtier
left
the
*NL*
room
when
he
had
finished
,
with
the
same
calmness
that
had
characterized
*NL*
him
during
the
whole
of
this
remarkable
and
trying
conversation
.
*NL*
Villefort
,
pale
and
agitated
,
ran
to
the
window
,
put
aside
the
curtain
,
*NL*
and
saw
him
pass
,
cool
and
collected
,
by
two
or
three
ill-looking
men
at
*NL*
the
corner
of
the
street
,
who
were
there
,
perhaps
,
to
arrest
a
man
with
*NL*
black
whiskers
,
and
a
blue
frock-coat
,
and
hat
with
broad
brim
.
*NL*
*NL*
Villefort
stood
watching
,
breathless
,
until
his
father
had
disappeared
*NL*
at
the
Rue
Bussy
.
Then
he
turned
to
the
various
articles
he
had
left
*NL*
behind
him
,
put
the
black
cravat
and
blue
frock-coat
at
the
bottom
of
*NL*
the
portmanteau
,
threw
the
hat
into
a
dark
closet
,
broke
the
cane
into
*NL*
small
bits
and
flung
it
in
the
fire
,
put
on
his
travelling-cap
,
and
*NL*
calling
his
valet
,
checked
with
a
look
the
thousand
questions
he
was
*NL*
ready
to
ask
,
paid
his
bill
,
sprang
into
his
carriage
,
which
was
ready
,
*NL*
learned
at
Lyons
that
Bonaparte
had
entered
Grenoble
,
and
in
the
*NL*
midst
of
the
tumult
which
prevailed
along
the
road
,
at
length
reached
*NL*
Marseilles
,
a
prey
to
all
the
hopes
and
fears
which
enter
into
the
heart

of
man
with
ambition
and
its
first
successes

Chapter
13
.
The
Hundred
Days
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Noirtier
was
a
true
prophet
,
and
things
progressed
rapidly
,
as
he
had
*NL*
predicted
.
Every
one
knows
the
history
of
the
famous
return
from
Elba
,
*NL*
a
return
which
was
unprecedented
in
the
past
,
and
will
probably
remain
*NL*
without
a
counterpart
in
the
future
.
*NL*
*NL*
Louis
XVIII
.
made
but
a
faint
attempt
to
parry
this
unexpected
blow
;
*NL*
the
monarchy
he
had
scarcely
reconstructed
tottered
on
its
precarious
*NL*
foundation
,
and
at
a
sign
from
the
emperor
the
incongruous
structure
*NL*
of
ancient
prejudices
and
new
ideas
fell
to
the
ground
.
Villefort
,
*NL*
therefore
,
gained
nothing
save
the
king
's
gratitude
-LRB-
which
was
rather
*NL*
likely
to
injure
him
at
the
present
time
-RRB-
and
the
cross
of
the
Legion
of
*NL*
Honor
,
which
he
had
the
prudence
not
to
wear
,
although
M.
de
Blacas
had
*NL*
duly
forwarded
the
brevet
.
*NL*
*NL*
Napoleon
would
,
doubtless
,
have
deprived
Villefort
of
his
office
had
*NL*
it
not
been
for
Noirtier
,
who
was
all
powerful
at
court
,
and
thus
the
*NL*
Girondin
of
'93
and
the
Senator
of
1806
protected
him
who
so
lately
*NL*
had
been
his
protector
.
All
Villefort
's
influence
barely
enabled
him
to
*NL*
stifle
the
secret
Dantes
had
so
nearly
divulged
.
The
king
's
procureur
*NL*
alone
was
deprived
of
his
office
,
being
suspected
of
royalism
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
scarcely
was
the
imperial
power
established
--
that
is
,
scarcely
*NL*
had
the
emperor
re-entered
the
Tuileries
and
begun
to
issue
orders
from
*NL*
the
closet
into
which
we
have
introduced
our
readers
,
--
he
found
on
the
*NL*
table
there
Louis
XVIII
.
's
half-filled
snuff-box
,
--
scarcely
had
this
*NL*
occurred
when
Marseilles
began
,
in
spite
of
the
authorities
,
to
rekindle
*NL*
the
flames
of
civil
war
,
always
smouldering
in
the
south
,
and
it
*NL*
required
but
little
to
excite
the
populace
to
acts
of
far
greater
*NL*
violence
than
the
shouts
and
insults
with
which
they
assailed
the
*NL*
royalists
whenever
they
ventured
abroad
.
*NL*
*NL*
Owing
to
this
change
,
the
worthy
shipowner
became
at
that
moment
--
we
*NL*
will
not
say
all
powerful
,
because
Morrel
was
a
prudent
and
rather
*NL*
a
timid
man
,
so
much
so
,
that
many
of
the
most
zealous
partisans
of
*NL*
Bonaparte
accused
him
of
``
moderation
''
--
but
sufficiently
influential
to
*NL*
make
a
demand
in
favor
of
Dantes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Villefort
retained
his
place
,
but
his
marriage
was
put
off
until
a
more
*NL*
favorable
opportunity
.
If
the
emperor
remained
on
the
throne
,
Gerard
*NL*
required
a
different
alliance
to
aid
his
career
;
if
Louis
XVIII
.
*NL*
returned
,
the
influence
of
M.
de
Saint-Meran
,
like
his
own
,
could
*NL*
be
vastly
increased
,
and
the
marriage
be
still
more
suitable
.
The
*NL*
deputy-procureur
was
,
therefore
,
the
first
magistrate
of
Marseilles
,
*NL*
when
one
morning
his
door
opened
,
and
M.
Morrel
was
announced
.
*NL*
*NL*
Any
one
else
would
have
hastened
to
receive
him
;
but
Villefort
was
a
man
*NL*
of
ability
,
and
he
knew
this
would
be
a
sign
of
weakness
.
He
made
Morrel
*NL*
wait
in
the
ante-chamber
,
although
he
had
no
one
with
him
,
for
the
*NL*
simple
reason
that
the
king
's
procureur
always
makes
every
one
wait
,
and
*NL*
after
passing
a
quarter
of
an
hour
in
reading
the
papers
,
he
ordered
M.
*NL*
Morrel
to
be
admitted
.
*NL*
*NL*
Morrel
expected
Villefort
would
be
dejected
;
he
found
him
as
he
had
*NL*
found
him
six
weeks
before
,
calm
,
firm
,
and
full
of
that
glacial
*NL*
politeness
,
that
most
insurmountable
barrier
which
separates
the
*NL*
well-bred
from
the
vulgar
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
entered
Villefort
's
office
expecting
that
the
magistrate
would
*NL*
tremble
at
the
sight
of
him
;
on
the
contrary
,
he
felt
a
cold
shudder
all
*NL*
over
him
when
he
saw
Villefort
sitting
there
with
his
elbow
on
his
desk
,
*NL*
and
his
head
leaning
on
his
hand
.
He
stopped
at
the
door
;
Villefort
*NL*
gazed
at
him
as
if
he
had
some
difficulty
in
recognizing
him
;
then
,
*NL*
after
a
brief
interval
,
during
which
the
honest
shipowner
turned
his
hat
*NL*
in
his
hands
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
M.
Morrel
,
I
believe
?
''
said
Villefort
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
nearer
,
''
said
the
magistrate
,
with
a
patronizing
wave
of
the
hand
,
*NL*
``
and
tell
me
to
what
circumstance
I
owe
the
honor
of
this
visit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
not
guess
,
monsieur
?
''
asked
Morrel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
in
the
least
;
but
if
I
can
serve
you
in
any
way
I
shall
be
*NL*
delighted
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Everything
depends
on
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Explain
yourself
,
pray
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
,
''
said
Morrel
,
recovering
his
assurance
as
he
proceeded
,
``
do
*NL*
you
recollect
that
a
few
days
before
the
landing
of
his
majesty
the
*NL*
emperor
,
I
came
to
intercede
for
a
young
man
,
the
mate
of
my
ship
,
who
*NL*
was
accused
of
being
concerned
in
correspondence
with
the
Island
of
*NL*
Elba
?
What
was
the
other
day
a
crime
is
to-day
a
title
to
favor
.
You
*NL*
then
served
Louis
XVIII.
,
and
you
did
not
show
any
favor
--
it
was
your
*NL*
duty
;
to-day
you
serve
Napoleon
,
and
you
ought
to
protect
him
--
it
is
*NL*
equally
your
duty
;
I
come
,
therefore
,
to
ask
what
has
become
of
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Villefort
by
a
strong
effort
sought
to
control
himself
.
``
What
is
his
*NL*
name
?
''
said
he
.
``
Tell
me
his
name
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Edmond
Dantes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Villefort
would
probably
have
rather
stood
opposite
the
muzzle
of
a
*NL*
pistol
at
five-and-twenty
paces
than
have
heard
this
name
spoken
;
but
he
*NL*
did
not
blanch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dantes
,
''
repeated
he
,
``
Edmond
Dantes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
monsieur
.
''
Villefort
opened
a
large
register
,
then
went
to
a
*NL*
table
,
from
the
table
turned
to
his
registers
,
and
then
,
turning
to
*NL*
Morrel
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
quite
sure
you
are
not
mistaken
,
monsieur
?
''
said
he
,
in
the
*NL*
most
natural
tone
in
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
Had
Morrel
been
a
more
quick-sighted
man
,
or
better
versed
in
these
*NL*
matters
,
he
would
have
been
surprised
at
the
king
's
procureur
answering
*NL*
him
on
such
a
subject
,
instead
of
referring
him
to
the
governors
of
the
*NL*
prison
or
the
prefect
of
the
department
.
But
Morrel
,
disappointed
in
*NL*
his
expectations
of
exciting
fear
,
was
conscious
only
of
the
other
's
*NL*
condescension
.
Villefort
had
calculated
rightly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Morrel
;
``
I
am
not
mistaken
.
I
have
known
him
for
ten
years
,
*NL*
the
last
four
of
which
he
was
in
my
service
.
Do
not
you
recollect
,
I
*NL*
came
about
six
weeks
ago
to
plead
for
clemency
,
as
I
come
to-day
to
*NL*
plead
for
justice
.
You
received
me
very
coldly
.
Oh
,
the
royalists
were
*NL*
very
severe
with
the
Bonapartists
in
those
days
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
,
''
returned
Villefort
,
``
I
was
then
a
royalist
,
because
I
*NL*
believed
the
Bourbons
not
only
the
heirs
to
the
throne
,
but
the
chosen
*NL*
of
the
nation
.
The
miraculous
return
of
Napoleon
has
conquered
me
,
the
*NL*
legitimate
monarch
is
he
who
is
loved
by
his
people
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
right
!

cried
Morrel
.
``
I
like
to
hear
you
speak
thus
,
and
I
*NL*
augur
well
for
Edmond
from
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait
a
moment
,
''
said
Villefort
,
turning
over
the
leaves
of
a
register
;
*NL*
``
I
have
it
--
a
sailor
,
who
was
about
to
marry
a
young
Catalan
girl

I
*NL*
recollect
now
;
it
was
a
very
serious
charge
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
How
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
that
when
he
left
here
he
was
taken
to
the
Palais
de
Justice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
made
my
report
to

a
week
after

was

carried
off

*NL*
*NL*
``
Carried
off

said
Morrel
.
``
What
can
they
have
done
with
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
he
has
been
taken
to
Fenestrelles

to
Pignerol

to
the

Some
fine
morning
he
will
return
to
take

your
vessel

*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
when
he
will
,
it
shall
be
kept
for
him

But
how
is
it
he
is
not
*NL*
already
returned
?
It
seems
to
me
the
first
care
of
government
should
be
*NL*
to
set
at
liberty
those
who
have
suffered
for
their
adherence
to
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
not
be
too
hasty
,
M.
Morrel
,
''
replied
Villefort
.
``
The
order
of
*NL*
imprisonment
came
from
high
authority
,
and
the
order
for
his
liberation
*NL*
must
proceed
from
the
same
source
;
and
,
as
Napoleon
has
scarcely
been
*NL*
reinstated
a
fortnight
,
the
letters
have
not
yet
been
forwarded

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,

said
Morrel
,
``
is
there
no
way

expediting
all
these

formalities

of
releasing
him
from
arrest

*NL*
*NL*
``
There
has
been
no
arrest

*NL*
*NL*
``
How
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
sometimes
essential
to
government
to
cause
a
man

disappearance

without
leaving
any
traces

no
written
forms

It
might
be
so

*NL*
``
It
has
always
been
so

my
dear
Morrel

the
reign

Louis
XIV

emperor
is
more
strict
in
prison
discipline

even
Louis
himself

*NL*
and
the
number
of
prisoners

not

*NL*
incalculable

Had
Morrel
even
any
suspicions
,
so
much
kindness
would
*NL*
have
dispelled
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

M.
de

would
you

every

read
three

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
true

he
will
read

guilty

as
much
my
duty

Villefort
thus
forestalled
any
danger

*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
be
so
good
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly

But
lose
no
time
;
we
have
lost
too
much
already
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
true
.
Only
think
what
the
poor
fellow
may
even
now
be
*NL*
suffering
.
''
Villefort
shuddered
at
the
suggestion
;
but
he
had
gone
*NL*
too
far
to
draw
back
.
Dantes
must
be
crushed
to
gratify
Villefort
's
*NL*
ambition
.
*NL*
*NL*
Villefort
dictated
a
petition
,
in
which
,
from
an
excellent
intention
,
no
*NL*
doubt
,
Dantes
'
patriotic
services
were
exaggerated
,
and
he
was
made
out
*NL*
one
of
the
most
active
agents
of
Napoleon
's
return
.
It
was
evident
that
*NL*
at
the
sight
of
this
document
the
minister
would
instantly
release
him
.
*NL*
The
petition
finished
,
Villefort
read
it
aloud
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
will
do
,
''
said
he
;
``
leave
the
rest
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
the
petition
go
soon
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To-day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Countersigned
by
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
best
thing
I
can
do
will
be
to
certify
the
truth
of
the
contents
*NL*
of
your
petition
.
''
And
,
sitting
down
,
Villefort
wrote
the
certificate
at
*NL*
the
bottom
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
more
is
to
be
done
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
do
whatever
is
necessary
.
''
This
assurance
delighted
Morrel
,
who
*NL*
took
leave
of
Villefort
,
and
hastened
to
announce
to
old
Dantes
that
he
*NL*
would
soon
see
his
son
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
Villefort
,
instead
of
sending
to
Paris
,
he
carefully
preserved
*NL*
the
petition
that
so
fearfully
compromised
Dantes
,
in
the
hopes
of
an
*NL*
event
that
seemed
not
unlikely
,
--
that
is
,
a
second
restoration
.
Dantes
*NL*
remained
a
prisoner
,
and
heard
not
the
noise
of
the
fall
of
Louis
*NL*
XVIII
.
's
throne
,
or
the
still
more
tragic
destruction
of
the
empire
.
*NL*
*NL*
Twice
during
the
Hundred
Days
had
Morrel
renewed
his
demand
,
and
twice
*NL*
had
Villefort
soothed
him
with
promises
.
At
last
there
was
Waterloo
,
*NL*
and
Morrel
came
no
more
;
he
had
done
all
that
was
in
his
power
,
and
any
*NL*
fresh
attempt
would
only
compromise
himself
uselessly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Louis
XVIII
.
remounted
the
throne
;
Villefort
,
to
whom
Marseilles
*NL*
had
become
filled
with
remorseful
memories
,
sought
and
obtained
the
*NL*
situation
of
king
's
procureur
at
Toulouse
,
and
a
fortnight
afterwards
*NL*
he
married
Mademoiselle
de
Saint-Meran
,
whose
father
now
stood
higher
at
*NL*
court
than
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
Dantes
,
after
the
Hundred
Days
and
after
Waterloo
,
remained
in
*NL*
his
dungeon
,
forgotten
of
earth
and
heaven
.
Danglars
comprehended
the
*NL*
full
extent
of
the
wretched
fate
that
overwhelmed
Dantes
;
and
,
when
*NL*
Napoleon
returned
to
France
,
he
,
after
the
manner
of
mediocre
minds
,
*NL*
termed
the
coincidence
,
``
a
decree
of
Providence
.
''
But
when
Napoleon
*NL*
returned
to
Paris
,
Danglars
'
heart
failed
him
,
and
he
lived
in
constant
*NL*
fear
of
Dantes
'
return
on
a
mission
of
vengeance
.
He
therefore
informed
*NL*
M.
Morrel
of
his
wish
to
quit
the
sea
,
and
obtained
a
recommendation
*NL*
from
him
to
a
Spanish
merchant
,
into
whose
service
he
entered
at
the
end
*NL*
of
March
,
that
is
,
ten
or
twelve
days
after
Napoleon
's
return
.
He
then
*NL*
left
for
Madrid
,
and
was
no
more
heard
of
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fernand
understood
nothing
except
that
Dantes
was
absent
.
What
had
*NL*
become
of
him
he
cared
not
to
inquire
.
Only
,
during
the
respite
the
*NL*
absence
of
his
rival
afforded
him
,
he
reflected
,
partly
on
the
means
of
*NL*
deceiving
Mercedes
as
to
the
cause
of
his
absence
,
partly
on
plans
of
*NL*
emigration
and
abduction
,
as
from
time
to
time
he
sat
sad
and
motionless
*NL*
on
the
summit
of
Cape
Pharo
,
at
the
spot
from
whence
Marseilles
and
*NL*
the
Catalans
are
visible
,
watching
for
the
apparition
of
a
young
and
*NL*
handsome
man
,
who
was
for
him
also
the
messenger
of
vengeance
.
Fernand
's
*NL*
mind
was
made
up
;
he
would
shoot
Dantes
,
and
then
kill
himself
.
But
*NL*
Fernand
was
mistaken
;
a
man
of
his
disposition
never
kills
himself
,
for
*NL*
he
constantly
hopes
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
this
time
the
empire
made
its
last
conscription
,
and
every
man
*NL*
in
France
capable
of
bearing
arms
rushed
to
obey
the
summons
of
the
*NL*
emperor
.
Fernand
departed
with
the
rest
,
bearing
with
him
the
terrible
*NL*
thought
that
while
he
was
away
,
his
rival
would
perhaps
return
and
marry
*NL*
Mercedes
.
Had
Fernand
really
meant
to
kill
himself
,
he
would
have
done
*NL*
so
when
he
parted
from
Mercedes
.
His
devotion
,
and
the
compassion
he
*NL*
showed
for
her
misfortunes
,
produced
the
effect
they
always
produce
on
*NL*
noble
minds
--
Mercedes
had
always
had
a
sincere
regard
for
Fernand
,
and
*NL*
this
was
now
strengthened
by
gratitude
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
brother
,
''
said
she
as
she
placed
his
knapsack
on
his
shoulders
,
*NL*
``
be
careful
of
yourself
,
for
if
you
are
killed
,
I
shall
be
alone
in
the
*NL*
world
.
''
These
words
carried
a
ray
of
hope
into
Fernand
's
heart
.
Should
*NL*
Dantes
not
return
,
Mercedes
might
one
day
be
his
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mercedes
was
left
alone
face
to
face
with
the
vast
plain
that
had
never
*NL*
seemed
so
barren
,
and
the
sea
that
had
never
seemed
so
vast
.
Bathed
in
*NL*
tears
she
wandered
about
the
Catalan
village
.
Sometimes
she
stood
mute
*NL*
and
motionless
as
a
statue
,
looking
towards
Marseilles
,
at
other
times
*NL*
gazing
on
the
sea
,
and
debating
as
to
whether
it
were
not
better
to
cast
*NL*
herself
into
the
abyss
of
the
ocean
,
and
thus
end
her
woes
.
It
was
*NL*
not
want
of
courage
that
prevented
her
putting
this
resolution
into
*NL*
execution
;
but
her
religious
feelings
came
to
her
aid
and
saved
her
.
*NL*
Caderousse
was
,
like
Fernand
,
enrolled
in
the
army
,
but
,
being
married
*NL*
and
eight
years
older
,
he
was
merely
sent
to
the
frontier
.
Old
Dantes
,
*NL*
who
was
only
sustained
by
hope
,
lost
all
hope
at
Napoleon
's
downfall
.
*NL*
Five
months
after
he
had
been
separated
from
his
son
,
and
almost
at
the
*NL*
hour
of
his
arrest
,
he
breathed
his
last
in
Mercedes
'
arms
.
M.
Morrel
*NL*
paid
the
expenses
of
his
funeral
,
and
a
few
small
debts
the
poor
old
man
*NL*
had
contracted
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
more
than
benevolence
in
this
action
;
there
was
courage
;
the
*NL*
south
was
aflame
,
and
to
assist
,
even
on
his
death-bed
,
the
father
of
so
*NL*
dangerous
a
Bonapartist
as
Dantes
,
was
stigmatized
as
a
crime
.

The
Two
Prisoners
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
year
after
Louis
XVIII
.
's
restoration
,
a
visit
was
made
by
the
*NL*
inspector-general
of
prisons
.
Dantes
in
his
cell
heard
the
noise
of
*NL*
preparation
,
--
sounds
that
at
the
depth
where
he
lay
would
have
been
*NL*
inaudible
to
any
but
the
ear
of
a
prisoner
,
who
could
hear
the
splash
of
*NL*
the
drop
of
water
that
every
hour
fell
from
the
roof
of
his
dungeon
.
He
*NL*
guessed
something
uncommon
was
passing
among
the
living
;
but
he
had
so
*NL*
long
ceased
to
have
any
intercourse
with
the
world
,
that
he
looked
upon
*NL*
himself
as
dead
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
inspector
visited
,
one
after
another
,
the
cells
and
dungeons
of
*NL*
several
of
the
prisoners
,
whose
good
behavior
or
stupidity
recommended
*NL*
them
to
the
clemency
of
the
government
.
He
inquired
how
they
were
fed
,
*NL*
and
if
they
had
any
request
to
make
.
The
universal
response
was
,
that
*NL*
the
fare
was
detestable
,
and
that
they
wanted
to
be
set
free
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
inspector
asked
if
they
had
anything
else
to
ask
for
.
They
shook
*NL*
their
heads
.
What
could
they
desire
beyond
their
liberty
?
The
inspector
*NL*
turned
smilingly
to
the
governor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
know
what
reason
government
can
assign
for
these
useless
*NL*
visits
;
when
you
see
one
prisoner
,
you
see
all
,
--
always
the
same
*NL*
thing
,
--
ill
fed
and
innocent
.
Are
there
any
others
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
the
dangerous
and
mad
prisoners
are
in
the
dungeons
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
visit
them
,
''
said
the
inspector
with
an
air
of
fatigue
.
``
We
must
*NL*
play
the
farce
to
the
end
.
Let
us
see
the
dungeons
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
first
send
for
two
soldiers
,
''
said
the
governor
.
``
The
prisoners
*NL*
sometimes
,
through
mere
uneasiness
of
life
,
and
in
order
to
be
sentenced
*NL*
to
death
,
commit
acts
of
useless
violence
,
and
you
might
fall
a
victim
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
all
needful
precautions
,
''
replied
the
inspector
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
soldiers
were
accordingly
sent
for
,
and
the
inspector
descended
*NL*
a
stairway
,
so
foul
,
so
humid
,
so
dark
,
as
to
be
loathsome
to
sight
,
*NL*
smell
,
and
respiration
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
cried
the
inspector
,
``
who
can
live
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
most
dangerous
conspirator
,
a
man
we
are
ordered
to
keep
the
most
*NL*
strict
watch
over
,
as
he
is
daring
and
resolute
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
alone
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
long
has
he
been
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nearly
a
year
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
he
placed
here
when
he
first
arrived
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
not
until
he
attempted
to
kill
the
turnkey
,
who
took
his
food
to
*NL*
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
kill
the
turnkey
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
the
very
one
who
is
lighting
us
.
Is
it
not
true
,
Antoine
?
''
asked
*NL*
the
governor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
True
enough
;
he
wanted
to
kill
me
!
''
returned
the
turnkey
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
must
be
mad
,
''
said
the
inspector
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
worse
than
that
,
--
he
is
a
devil
!
''
returned
the
turnkey
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
I
complain
of
him
?
''
demanded
the
inspector
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
;
it
is
useless
.
Besides
,
he
is
almost
mad
now
,
and
in
another
*NL*
year
he
will
be
quite
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
much
the
better
for
him
,
--
he
will
suffer
less
,
''
said
the
inspector
.
*NL*
He
was
,
as
this
remark
shows
,
a
man
full
of
philanthropy
,
and
in
every
*NL*
way
fit
for
his
office
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
right
,
sir
,
''
replied
the
governor
;
``
and
this
remark
proves
that
*NL*
you
have
deeply
considered
the
subject
.
Now
we
have
in
a
dungeon
about
*NL*
twenty
feet
distant
,
and
to
which
you
descend
by
another
stair
,
an
abbe
,
*NL*
formerly
leader
of
a
party
in
Italy
,
who
has
been
here
since
1811
,
and
*NL*
in
1813
he
went
mad
,
and
the
change
is
astonishing
.
He
used
to
weep
,
he
*NL*
now
laughs
;
he
grew
thin
,
he
now
grows
fat
.
You
had
better
see
him
,
for
*NL*
his
madness
is
amusing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
see
them
both
,
''
returned
the
inspector
;
``
I
must
conscientiously
*NL*
perform
my
duty
.
''
This
was
the
inspector
's
first
visit
;
he
wished
to
*NL*
display
his
authority
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
visit
this
one
first
,
''
added
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
all
means
,
''
replied
the
governor
,
and
he
signed
to
the
turnkey
to
*NL*
open
the
door
.
At
the
sound
of
the
key
turning
in
the
lock
,
and
the
*NL*
creaking
of
the
hinges
,
Dantes
,
who
was
crouched
in
a
corner
of
the
*NL*
dungeon
,
whence
he
could
see
the
ray
of
light
that
came
through
a
narrow
*NL*
iron
grating
above
,
raised
his
head
.
Seeing
a
stranger
,
escorted
by
two
*NL*
turnkeys
holding
torches
and
accompanied
by
two
soldiers
,
and
to
whom
*NL*
the
governor
spoke
bareheaded
,
Dantes
,
who
guessed
the
truth
,
and
that
*NL*
the
moment
to
address
himself
to
the
superior
authorities
was
come
,
*NL*
sprang
forward
with
clasped
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
soldiers
interposed
their
bayonets
,
for
they
thought
that
he
was
*NL*
about
to
attack
the
inspector
,
and
the
latter
recoiled
two
or
three
*NL*
steps
.
Dantes
saw
that
he
was
looked
upon
as
dangerous
.
Then
,
infusing
*NL*
all
the
humility
he
possessed
into
his
eyes
and
voice
,
he
addressed
the
*NL*
inspector
,
and
sought
to
inspire
him
with
pity
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
inspector
listened
attentively
;
then
,
turning
to
the
governor
,
*NL*
observed
,
``
He
will
become
religious
--
he
is
already
more
gentle
;
he
is
*NL*
afraid
,
and
retreated
before
the
bayonets
--
madmen
are
not
afraid
of
*NL*
anything
;
I
made
some
curious
observations
on
this
at
Charenton
.
''
Then
,
*NL*
turning
to
the
prisoner
,
``
What
is
it
you
want
?
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
to
know
what
crime
I
have
committed
--
to
be
tried
;
and
if
I
am
*NL*
guilty
,
to
be
shot
;
if
innocent
,
to
be
set
at
liberty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
well
fed
?
''
said
the
inspector
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
so
;
I
do
n't
know
;
it
's
of
no
consequence
.
What
matters
*NL*
really
,
not
only
to
me
,
but
to
officers
of
justice
and
the
king
,
is
that
*NL*
an
innocent
man
should
languish
in
prison

Dantes

Oh

you

seventeen

seventeen

a
man

arrived
at

to
a
man

was
on
the

an

opened

ignorant

still
living

Seventeen

months
captivity
to
a

accustomed

the
boundless
ocean

a

worse
punishment

ask

Dantes
fell

prayed
earnestly

The
door
closed

this

*NL*
``
Ah

The

obeyed

the

gazed
curiously
into
the
chamber
of
the

*NL*
*NL*
In
the
centre
of
the
cell
,
in
a
circle
traced
with
a
fragment
of
plaster
*NL*
detached
from
the
wall
,
sat
a
man
whose
tattered
garments
scarcely
*NL*
covered
him
.
He
was
drawing
in
this
circle
geometrical
lines
,
and
seemed
*NL*
as
much
absorbed
in
his
problem
as
Archimedes
was
when
the
soldier
of
*NL*
Marcellus
slew
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
move
at
the
sound
of
the
door
,
and
continued
his
calculations
*NL*
until
the
flash
of
the
torches
lighted
up
with
an
unwonted
glare
the
*NL*
sombre
walls
of
his
cell
;
then
,
raising
his
head
,
he
perceived
with
*NL*
astonishment
the
number
of
persons
present
.
He
hastily
seized
the
*NL*
coverlet
of
his
bed
,
and
wrapped
it
round
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it

said
the

*NL*
*NL*

surprise

``
I

*NL*
*NL*
``
You

realized
the

After
all
,
''
said
the
inspector
,
``
if
he
had
been
rich
,
he
would
not
have
*NL*
been
here
.
''
So
the
matter
ended
for
the
Abbe
Faria
.
He
remained
in
his
*NL*
cell
,
and
this
visit
only
increased
the
belief
in
his
insanity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Caligula
or
Nero
,
those
treasure-seekers
,
those
desirers
of
the
*NL*
impossible
,
would
have
accorded
to
the
poor
wretch
,
in
exchange
for
his
*NL*
wealth
,
the
liberty
he
so
earnestly
prayed
for
.
But
the
kings
of
modern
*NL*
times
,
restrained
by
the
limits
of
mere
probability
,
have
neither
*NL*
courage
nor
desire
.
They
fear
the
ear
that
hears
their
orders
,
and
the
*NL*
eye
that
scrutinizes
their
actions
.
Formerly
they
believed
themselves
*NL*
sprung
from
Jupiter
,
and
shielded
by
their
birth
;
but
nowadays
they
are
*NL*
not
inviolable
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
has
always
been
against
the
policy
of
despotic
governments
to
suffer
*NL*
the
victims
of
their
persecutions
to
reappear
.
As
the
Inquisition
rarely
*NL*
allowed
its
victims
to
be
seen
with
their
limbs
distorted
and
their
*NL*
flesh
lacerated
by
torture
,
so
madness
is
always
concealed
in
its
cell
,
*NL*
from
whence
,
should
it
depart
,
it
is
conveyed
to
some
gloomy
hospital
,
*NL*
where
the
doctor
has
no
thought
for
man
or
mind
in
the
mutilated
being
*NL*
the
jailer
delivers
to
him
.
The
very
madness
of
the
Abbe
Faria
,
gone
mad
*NL*
in
prison
,
condemned
him
to
perpetual
captivity
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
inspector
kept
his
word
with
Dantes
;
he
examined
the
register
,
and
*NL*
found
the
following
note
concerning
him
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
Edmond
Dantes
:
*NL*
*NL*
Violent
Bonapartist
;
took
an
active
part
in
the
return
from
Elba
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
greatest
watchfulness
and
care
to
be
exercised
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
note
was
in
a
different
hand
from
the
rest
,
which
showed
that
it
*NL*
had
been
added
since
his
confinement
.
The
inspector
could
not
contend
*NL*
against
this
accusation
;
he
simply
wrote
,
--
``
Nothing
to
be
done
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
visit
had
infused
new
vigor
into
Dantes
;
he
had
,
till
then
,
*NL*
forgotten
the
date
;
but
now
,
with
a
fragment
of
plaster
,
he
wrote
the
*NL*
date
,
30th
July
,
1816
,
and
made
a
mark
every
day
,
in
order
not
to
lose
*NL*
his
reckoning
again
.
Days
and
weeks
passed
away
,
then
months
--
Dantes
*NL*
still
waited
;
he
at
first
expected
to
be
freed
in
a
fortnight
.
This
*NL*
fortnight
expired
,
he
decided
that
the
inspector
would
do
nothing
until
*NL*
his
return
to
Paris
,
and
that
he
would
not
reach
there
until
his
circuit
*NL*
was
finished
,
he
therefore
fixed
three
months
;
three
months
passed
*NL*
away
,
then
six
more
.
Finally
ten
months
and
a
half
had
gone
by
and
*NL*
no
favorable
change
had
taken
place
,
and
Dantes
began
to
fancy
the
*NL*
inspector
's
visit
but
a
dream
,
an
illusion
of
the
brain
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
expiration
of
a
year
the
governor
was
transferred
;
he
had
*NL*
obtained
charge
of
the
fortress
at
Ham
.
He
took
with
him
several
of
his
*NL*
subordinates
,
and
amongst
them
Dantes
'
jailer
.
A
new
governor
arrived
;
*NL*
it
would
have
been
too
tedious
to
acquire
the
names
of
the
prisoners
;
*NL*
he
learned
their
numbers
instead
.
This
horrible
place
contained
fifty
*NL*
cells
;
their
inhabitants
were
designated
by
the
numbers
of
their
cell
,
*NL*
and
the
unhappy
young
man
was
no
longer
called
Edmond
Dantes
--
he
was
now
*NL*
number
34
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
15
.
Number
34
and
Number
27
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dantes
passed
through
all
the
stages
of
torture
natural
to
prisoners
in
*NL*
suspense
.
He
was
sustained
at
first
by
that
pride
of
conscious
innocence
*NL*
which
is
the
sequence
to
hope
;
then
he
began
to
doubt
his
own
innocence
,
*NL*
which
justified
in
some
measure
the
governor
's
belief
in
his
mental
*NL*
alienation
;
and
then
,
relaxing
his
sentiment
of
pride
,
he
addressed
his
*NL*
supplications
,
not
to
God
,
but
to
man
.
God
is
always
the
last
resource
.
*NL*
Unfortunates
,
who
ought
to
begin
with
God
,
do
not
have
any
hope
in
him
*NL*
till
they
have
exhausted
all
other
means
of
deliverance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dantes
asked
to
be
removed
from
his
present
dungeon
into
another
;
for
*NL*
a
change
,
however
disadvantageous
,
was
still
a
change
,
and
would
afford
*NL*
him
some
amusement
.
He
entreated
to
be
allowed
to
walk
about
,
to
have
*NL*
fresh
air
,
books
,
and
writing
materials
.
His
requests
were
not
granted
,
*NL*
but
he
went
on
asking
all
the
same
.
He
accustomed
himself
to
speaking
to
*NL*
the
new
jailer
,
although
the
latter
was
,
if
possible
,
more
taciturn
*NL*
than
the
old
one
;
but
still
,
to
speak
to
a
man
,
even
though
mute
,
was
*NL*
something
.
Dantes
spoke
for
the
sake
of
hearing
his
own
voice
;
he
had
*NL*
tried
to
speak
when
alone
,
but
the
sound
of
his
voice
terrified
him
.
*NL*
Often
,
before
his
captivity
,
Dantes
'
mind
had
revolted
at
the
idea
of
*NL*
assemblages
of
prisoners
,
made
up
of
thieves
,
vagabonds
,
and
murderers
.
*NL*
He
now
wished
to
be
amongst
them
,
in
order
to
see
some
other
face
*NL*
besides
that
of
his
jailer
;
he
sighed
for
the
galleys
,
with
the
infamous
*NL*
costume
,
the
chain
,
and
the
brand
on
the
shoulder
.
The
galley-slaves
*NL*
breathed
the
fresh
air
of
heaven
,
and
saw
each
other
.
They
were
very
*NL*
happy
.
He
besought
the
jailer
one
day
to
let
him
have
a
companion
,
were
*NL*
it
even
the
mad
abbe
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
jailer
,
though
rough
and
hardened
by
the
constant
sight
of
so
much
*NL*
suffering
,
was
yet
a
man
.
At
the
bottom
of
his
heart
he
had
often
had
a
*NL*
feeling
of
pity
for
this
unhappy
young
man
who
suffered
so
;
and
he
laid
*NL*
the
request
of
number
34
before
the
governor
;
but
the
latter
sapiently
*NL*
imagined
that
Dantes
wished
to
conspire
or
attempt
an
escape
,
and
*NL*
refused
his
request
.
Dantes
had
exhausted
all
human
resources
,
and
he
*NL*
then
turned
to
God
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
pious
ideas
that
had
been
so
long
forgotten
,
returned
;
he
*NL*
recollected
the
prayers
his
mother
had
taught
him
,
and
discovered
a
new
*NL*
meaning
in
every
word
;
for
in
prosperity
prayers
seem
but
a
mere
*NL*
medley
of
words
,
until
misfortune
comes
and
the
unhappy
sufferer
first
*NL*
understands
the
meaning
of
the
sublime
language
in
which
he
invokes
the
*NL*
pity
of
heaven
!
He
prayed
,
and
prayed
aloud
,
no
longer
terrified
at
*NL*
the
sound
of
his
own
voice
,
for
he
fell
into
a
sort
of
ecstasy
.
He
*NL*
laid
every
action
of
his
life
before
the
Almighty
,
proposed
tasks
to
*NL*
accomplish
,
and
at
the
end
of
every
prayer
introduced
the
entreaty
*NL*
oftener
addressed
to
man
than
to
God
:
``
Forgive
us
our
trespasses
as
*NL*
we
forgive
them
that
trespass
against
us
.
''
Yet
in
spite
of
his
earnest
*NL*
prayers
,
Dantes
remained
a
prisoner
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
gloom
settled
heavily
upon
him
.
Dantes
was
a
man
of
great
*NL*
simplicity
of
thought
,
and
without
education
;
he
could
not
,
therefore
,
*NL*
in
the
solitude
of
his
dungeon
,
traverse
in
mental
vision
the
history
of
*NL*
the
ages
,
bring
to
life
the
nations
that
had
perished
,
and
rebuild
the
*NL*
ancient
cities
so
vast
and
stupendous
in
the
light
of
the
imagination
,
*NL*
and
that
pass
before
the
eye
glowing
with
celestial
colors
in
Martin
's
*NL*
Babylonian
pictures
.
He
could
not
do
this
,
he
whose
past
life
was
so
*NL*
short
,
whose
present
so
melancholy
,
and
his
future
so
doubtful
.
Nineteen
*NL*
years
of
light
to
reflect
upon
in
eternal
darkness
!
No
distraction
could
*NL*
come
to
his
aid
;
his
energetic
spirit
,
that
would
have
exalted
in
thus
*NL*
revisiting
the
past
,
was
imprisoned
like
an
eagle
in
a
cage
.
He
clung
to
*NL*
one
idea
--
that
of
his
happiness
,
destroyed
,
without
apparent
cause
,
*NL*
by
an
unheard-of
fatality
;
he
considered
and
reconsidered
this
idea
,
*NL*
devoured
it
-LRB-
so
to
speak
-RRB-
,
as
the
implacable
Ugolino
devours
the
skull
*NL*
of
Archbishop
Roger
in
the
Inferno
of
Dante
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rage
supplanted
religious
fervor
.
Dantes
uttered
blasphemies
that
made
*NL*
his
jailer
recoil
with
horror
,
dashed
himself
furiously
against
the
*NL*
walls
of
his
prison
,
wreaked
his
anger
upon
everything
,
and
chiefly
upon
*NL*
himself
,
so
that
the
least
thing
,
--
a
grain
of
sand
,
a
straw
,
or
a
breath
*NL*
of
air
that
annoyed
him
,
led
to
paroxysms
of
fury
.
Then
the
letter
that
*NL*
Villefort
had
showed
to
him
recurred
to
his
mind
,
and
every
line
gleamed
*NL*
forth
in
fiery
letters
on
the
wall
like
the
mene
tekel
upharsin
of
*NL*
Belshazzar
.
He
told
himself
that
it
was
the
enmity
of
man
,
and
not
the
*NL*
vengeance
of
heaven
,
that
had
thus
plunged
him
into
the
deepest
misery
.
*NL*
He
consigned
his
unknown
persecutors
to
the
most
horrible
tortures
he
*NL*
could
imagine
,
and
found
them
all
insufficient
,
because
after
torture
*NL*
came
death
,
and
after
death
,
if
not
repose
,
at
least
the
boon
of
*NL*
unconsciousness
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
dint
of
constantly
dwelling
on
the
idea
that
tranquillity
was
death
,
*NL*
and
if
punishment
were
the
end
in
view
other
tortures
than
death
must
be
*NL*
invented
,
he
began
to
reflect
on
suicide
.
Unhappy
he
,
who
,
on
the
brink
*NL*
of
misfortune
,
broods
over
ideas
like
these
!
*NL*
*NL*
Before
him
is
a
dead
sea
that
stretches
in
azure
calm
before
the
eye
;
*NL*
but
he
who
unwarily
ventures
within
its
embrace
finds
himself
struggling
*NL*
with
a
monster
that
would
drag
him
down
to
perdition
.
Once
thus
*NL*
ensnared
,
unless
the
protecting
hand
of
God
snatch
him
thence
,
all
is
*NL*
over
,
and
his
struggles
but
tend
to
hasten
his
destruction
.
This
state
*NL*
of
mental
anguish
is
,
however
,
less
terrible
than
the
sufferings
that
*NL*
precede
or
the
punishment
that
possibly
will
follow
.
There
is
a
sort
of
*NL*
consolation
at
the
contemplation
of
the
yawning
abyss
,
at
the
bottom
of
*NL*
which
lie
darkness
and
obscurity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Edmond
found
some
solace
in
these
ideas
.
All
his
sorrows
,
all
his
*NL*
sufferings
,
with
their
train
of
gloomy
spectres
,
fled
from
his
cell
when
*NL*
the
angel
of
death
seemed
about
to
enter
.
Dantes
reviewed
his
past
*NL*
life
with
composure
,
and
,
looking
forward
with
terror
to
his
future
*NL*
existence
,
chose
that
middle
line
that
seemed
to
afford
him
a
refuge
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sometimes
,
''
said
he
,
``
in
my
voyages
,
when
I
was
a
man
and
commanded
*NL*
other
men
,
I
have
seen
the
heavens
overcast
,
the
sea
rage
and
foam
,
the
*NL*
storm
arise
,
and
,
like
a
monstrous
bird
,
beating
the
two
horizons
with
*NL*
its
wings
.
Then
I
felt
that
my
vessel
was
a
vain
refuge
,
that
trembled
*NL*
and
shook
before
the
tempest
.
Soon
the
fury
of
the
waves
and
the
sight
*NL*
of
the
sharp
rocks
announced
the
approach
of
death
,
and
death
then
*NL*
terrified
me
,
and
I
used
all
my
skill
and
intelligence
as
a
man
and
a
*NL*
sailor
to
struggle
against
the
wrath
of
God
.
But
I
did
so
because
I
was
*NL*
happy
,
because
I
had
not
courted
death
,
because
to
be
cast
upon
a
bed
*NL*
of
rocks
and
seaweed
seemed
terrible
,
because
I
was
unwilling
that
I
,
a
*NL*
creature
made
for
the
service
of
God
,
should
serve
for
food
to
the
gulls
*NL*
and
ravens
.
But
now
it
is
different
;
I
have
lost
all
that
bound
me
to
*NL*
life
,
death
smiles
and
invites
me
to
repose
;
I
die
after
my
own
manner
,
*NL*
I
die
exhausted
and
broken-spirited
,
as
I
fall
asleep
when
I
have
paced
*NL*
three
thousand
times
round
my
cell
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
No
sooner
had
this
idea
taken
possession
of
him
than
he
became
more
*NL*
composed
,
arranged
his
couch
to
the
best
of
his
power
,
ate
little
and
*NL*
slept
less
,
and
found
existence
almost
supportable
,
because
he
felt
that
*NL*
he
could
throw
it
off
at
pleasure
,
like
a
worn-out
garment
.
Two
methods
*NL*
of
self-destruction
were
at
his
disposal
.
He
could
hang
himself
with
his
*NL*
handkerchief
to
the
window
bars
,
or
refuse
food
and
die
of
starvation
.
*NL*
But
the
first
was
repugnant
to
him
.
Dantes
had
always
entertained
the
*NL*
greatest
horror
of
pirates
,
who
are
hung
up
to
the
yard-arm
;
he
would
*NL*
not
die
by
what
seemed
an
infamous
death
.
He
resolved
to
adopt
the
*NL*
second
,
and
began
that
day
to
carry
out
his
resolve
.
Nearly
four
years
*NL*
had
passed
away
;
at
the
end
of
the
second
he
had
ceased
to
mark
the
*NL*
lapse
of
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dantes
said
,
``
I
wish
to
die
,
''
and
had
chosen
the
manner
of
his
death
,
*NL*
and
fearful
of
changing
his
mind
,
he
had
taken
an
oath
to
die
.
``
When
my
*NL*
morning
and
evening
meals
are
brought
,
''
thought
he
,
``
I
will
cast
them
*NL*
out
of
the
window
,
and
they
will
think
that
I
have
eaten
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
kept
his
word
;
twice
a
day
he
cast
out
,
through
the
barred
aperture
,
*NL*
the
provisions
his
jailer
brought
him
--
at
first
gayly
,
then
with
*NL*
deliberation
,
and
at
last
with
regret
.
Nothing
but
the
recollection
*NL*
of
his
oath
gave
him
strength
to
proceed
.
Hunger
made
viands
once
*NL*
repugnant
,
now
acceptable
;
he
held
the
plate
in
his
hand
for
an
hour
*NL*
at
a
time
,
and
gazed
thoughtfully
at
the
morsel
of
bad
meat
,
of
tainted
*NL*
fish
,
of
black
and
mouldy
bread
.
It
was
the
last
yearning
for
life
*NL*
contending
with
the
resolution
of
despair
;
then
his
dungeon
seemed
less
*NL*
sombre
,
his
prospects
less
desperate
.
He
was
still
young
--
he
was
*NL*
only
four
or
five
and
twenty
--
he
had
nearly
fifty
years
to
live
.
What
*NL*
unforseen
events
might
not
open
his
prison
door
,
and
restore
him
to
*NL*
liberty
?
Then
he
raised
to
his
lips
the
repast
that
,
like
a
voluntary
*NL*
Tantalus
,
he
refused
himself
;
but
he
thought
of
his
oath
,
and
he
*NL*
would
not
break
it
.
He
persisted
until
,
at
last
,
he
had
not
sufficient
*NL*
strength
to
rise
and
cast
his
supper
out
of
the
loophole
.
The
next
*NL*
morning
he
could
not
see
or
hear
;
the
jailer
feared
he
was
dangerously
*NL*
ill
.
Edmond
hoped
he
was
dying
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
the
day
passed
away
.
Edmond
felt
a
sort
of
stupor
creeping
over
him
*NL*
which
brought
with
it
a
feeling
almost
of
content
;
the
gnawing
pain
at
*NL*
his
stomach
had
ceased
;
his
thirst
had
abated
;
when
he
closed
his
eyes
*NL*
he
saw
myriads
of
lights
dancing
before
them
like
the
will-o
'
-
the-wisps
*NL*
that
play
about
the
marshes
.
It
was
the
twilight
of
that
mysterious
*NL*
country
called
Death
!
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
,
about
nine
o'clock
in
the
evening
,
Edmond
heard
a
hollow
sound
*NL*
in
the
wall
against
which
he
was
lying
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
many
loathsome
animals
inhabited
the
prison
,
that
their
noise
did
*NL*
not
,
in
general
,
awake
him
;
but
whether
abstinence
had
quickened
his
*NL*
faculties
,
or
whether
the
noise
was
really
louder
than
usual
,
Edmond
*NL*
raised
his
head
and
listened
.
It
was
a
continual
scratching
,
as
if
made
*NL*
by
a
huge
claw
,
a
powerful
tooth
,
or
some
iron
instrument
attacking
the
*NL*
stones
.
*NL*
*NL*
Although
weakened
,
the
young
man
's
brain
instantly
responded
to
the
idea
*NL*
that
haunts
all
prisoners
--
liberty
!
It
seemed
to
him
that
heaven
had
*NL*
at
length
taken
pity
on
him
,
and
had
sent
this
noise
to
warn
him
on
the
*NL*
very
brink
of
the
abyss
.
Perhaps
one
of
those
beloved
ones
he
had
so
*NL*
often
thought
of
was
thinking
of
him
,
and
striving
to
diminish
the
*NL*
distance
that
separated
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
,
no
,
doubtless
he
was
deceived
,
and
it
was
but
one
of
those
dreams
*NL*
that
forerun
death
!
*NL*
*NL*
Edmond
still
heard
the
sound
.
It
lasted
nearly
three
hours
;
he
then
*NL*
heard
a
noise
of
something
falling
,
and
all
was
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
hours
afterwards
it
began
again
,
nearer
and
more
distinct
.
Edmond
*NL*
was
intensely
interested
.
Suddenly
the
jailer
entered
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
week
since
he
had
resolved
to
die
,
and
during
the
four
days
that
*NL*
he
had
been
carrying
out
his
purpose
,
Edmond
had
not
spoken
to
the
*NL*
attendant
,
had
not
answered
him
when
he
inquired
what
was
the
matter
*NL*
with
him
,
and
turned
his
face
to
the
wall
when
he
looked
too
curiously
*NL*
at
him
;
but
now
the
jailer
might
hear
the
noise
and
put
an
end
to
*NL*
it
,
and
so
destroy
a
ray
of
something
like
hope
that
soothed
his
last
*NL*
moments
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
jailer
brought
him
his
breakfast
.
Dantes
raised
himself
up
and
began
*NL*
to
talk
about
everything
;
about
the
bad
quality
of
the
food
,
about
the
*NL*
coldness
of
his
dungeon
,
grumbling
and
complaining
,
in
order
to
have
an
*NL*
excuse
for
speaking
louder
,
and
wearying
the
patience
of
his
jailer
,
*NL*
who
out
of
kindness
of
heart
had
brought
broth
and
white
bread
for
his
*NL*
prisoner
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fortunately
,
he
fancied
that
Dantes
was
delirious
;
and
placing
the
food
*NL*
on
the
rickety
table
,
he
withdrew
.
Edmond
listened
,
and
the
sound
became
*NL*
more
and
more
distinct
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
can
be
no
doubt
about
it
,
''
thought
he
;
``
it
is
some
prisoner
who
*NL*
is
striving
to
obtain
his
freedom
.
Oh
,
if
I
were
only
there
to
help
*NL*
him
!
''
Suddenly
another
idea
took
possession
of
his
mind
,
so
used
to
*NL*
misfortune
,
that
it
was
scarcely
capable
of
hope
--
the
idea
that
the
*NL*
noise
was
made
by
workmen
the
governor
had
ordered
to
repair
the
*NL*
neighboring
dungeon
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
easy
to
ascertain
this
;
but
how
could
he
risk
the
question
?
It
*NL*
was
easy
to
call
his
jailer
's
attention
to
the
noise
,
and
watch
his
*NL*
countenance
as
he
listened
;
but
might
he
not
by
this
means
destroy
*NL*
hopes
far
more
important
than
the
short-lived
satisfaction
of
his
own
*NL*
curiosity
?
Unfortunately
,
Edmond
's
brain
was
still
so
feeble
that
he
*NL*
could
not
bend
his
thoughts
to
anything
in
particular
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
saw
but
one
means
of
restoring
lucidity
and
clearness
to
his
*NL*
judgment
.
He
turned
his
eyes
towards
the
soup
which
the
jailer
had
*NL*
brought
,
rose
,
staggered
towards
it
,
raised
the
vessel
to
his
lips
,
and
*NL*
drank
off
the
contents
with
a
feeling
of
indescribable
pleasure
.
He
had
*NL*
often
heard
that
shipwrecked
persons
had
died
through
having
eagerly
*NL*
devoured
too
much
food
.
Edmond
replaced
on
the
table
the
bread
he
was
*NL*
about
to
devour
,
and
returned
to
his
couch
--
he
did
not
wish
to
die
.
He
*NL*
soon
felt
that
his
ideas
became
again
collected
--
he
could
think
,
and
*NL*
strengthen
his
thoughts
by
reasoning
.
Then
he
said
to
himself
,
``
I
must
*NL*
put
this
to
the
test
,
but
without
compromising
anybody
.
If
it
is
a
*NL*
workman
,
I
need
but
knock
against
the
wall
,
and
he
will
cease
to
work
,
*NL*
in
order
to
find
out
who
is
knocking
,
and
why
he
does
so
;
but
as
his
*NL*
occupation
is
sanctioned
by
the
governor
,
he
will
soon
resume
it
.
If
,
on
*NL*
the
contrary
,
it
is
a
prisoner
,
the
noise
I
make
will
alarm
him
,
he
will
*NL*
cease
,
and
not
begin
again
until
he
thinks
every
one
is
asleep
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Edmond
rose
again
,
but
this
time
his
legs
did
not
tremble
,
and
his
sight
*NL*
was
clear
;
he
went
to
a
corner
of
his
dungeon
,
detached
a
stone
,
and
*NL*
with
it
knocked
against
the
wall
where
the
sound
came
.
He
struck
thrice
.
*NL*
At
the
first
blow
the
sound
ceased
,
as
if
by
magic
.
*NL*
*NL*
Edmond
listened
intently
;
an
hour
passed
,
two
hours
passed
,
and
no
sound
*NL*
was
heard
from
the
wall
--
all
was
silent
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
Full
of
hope
,
Edmond
swallowed
a
few
mouthfuls
of
bread
and
water
,
*NL*
and
,
thanks
to
the
vigor
of
his
constitution
,
found
himself
well-nigh
*NL*
recovered
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
day
passed
away
in
utter
silence
--
night
came
without
recurrence
of
*NL*
the
noise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
prisoner
,
''
said
Edmond
joyfully
.
The
night
passed
in
perfect
*NL*
silence
.
Edmond
did
not
close
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
morning
the
jailer
brought
him
fresh
provisions
--
he
had
already
*NL*
devoured
those
of
the
previous
day
;
he
ate
these
listening
anxiously
for
*NL*
the
sound
,
walking
round
and
round
his
cell
,
shaking
the
iron
bars
of
*NL*
the
loophole
,
restoring
vigor
and
agility
to
his
limbs
by
exercise
,
and
*NL*
so
preparing
himself
for
his
future
destiny
.
At
intervals
he
listened
*NL*
to
learn
if
the
noise
had
not
begun
again
,
and
grew
impatient
at
the
*NL*
prudence
of
the
prisoner
,
who
did
not
guess
he
had
been
disturbed
by
a
*NL*
captive
as
anxious
for
liberty
as
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Three
days
passed
--
seventy-two
long
tedious
hours
which
he
counted
off
*NL*
by
minutes
!
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
one
evening
,
as
the
jailer
was
visiting
him
for
the
last
time
*NL*
that
night
,
Dantes
,
with
his
ear
for
the
hundredth
time
at
the
wall
,
*NL*
fancied
he
heard
an
almost
imperceptible
movement
among
the
stones
.
He
*NL*
moved
away
,
walked
up
and
down
his
cell
to
collect
his
thoughts
,
and
*NL*
then
went
back
and
listened
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
matter
was
no
longer
doubtful
.
Something
was
at
work
on
the
other
*NL*
side
of
the
wall
;
the
prisoner
had
discovered
the
danger
,
and
had
*NL*
substituted
a
lever
for
a
chisel
.
*NL*
*NL*
Encouraged
by
this
discovery
,
Edmond
determined
to
assist
the
*NL*
indefatigable
laborer
.
He
began
by
moving
his
bed
,
and
looked
around
*NL*
for
anything
with
which
he
could
pierce
the
wall
,
penetrate
the
moist
*NL*
cement
,
and
displace
a
stone
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
saw
nothing
,
he
had
no
knife
or
sharp
instrument
,
the
window
grating
*NL*
was
of
iron
,
but
he
had
too
often
assured
himself
of
its
solidity
.
All
*NL*
his
furniture
consisted
of
a
bed
,
a
chair
,
a
table
,
a
pail
,
and
a
jug
.
*NL*
The
bed
had
iron
clamps
,
but
they
were
screwed
to
the
wood
,
and
it
would
*NL*
have
required
a
screw-driver
to
take
them
off
.
The
table
and
chair
*NL*
had
nothing
,
the
pail
had
once
possessed
a
handle
,
but
that
had
been
*NL*
removed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dantes
had
but
one
resource
,
which
was
to
break
the
jug
,
and
with
one
of
*NL*
the
sharp
fragments
attack
the
wall
.
He
let
the
jug
fall
on
the
floor
,
*NL*
and
it
broke
in
pieces
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dantes
concealed
two
or
three
of
the
sharpest
fragments
in
his
bed
,
*NL*
leaving
the
rest
on
the
floor
.
The
breaking
of
his
jug
was
too
natural
*NL*
an
accident
to
excite
suspicion
.
Edmond
had
all
the
night
to
work
in
,
*NL*
but
in
the
darkness
he
could
not
do
much
,
and
he
soon
felt
that
he
was
*NL*
working
against
something
very
hard
;
he
pushed
back
his
bed
,
and
waited
*NL*
for
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
night
he
heard
the
subterranean
workman
,
who
continued
to
mine
his
*NL*
way
.
Day
came
,
the
jailer
entered
.
Dantes
told
him
that
the
jug
had
*NL*
fallen
from
his
hands
while
he
was
drinking
,
and
the
jailer
went
*NL*
grumblingly
to
fetch
another
,
without
giving
himself
the
trouble
to
*NL*
remove
the
fragments
of
the
broken
one
.
He
returned
speedily
,
advised
*NL*
the
prisoner
to
be
more
careful
,
and
departed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dantes
heard
joyfully
the
key
grate
in
the
lock
;
he
listened
until
the
*NL*
sound
of
steps
died
away
,
and
then
,
hastily
displacing
his
bed
,
saw
*NL*
by
the
faint
light
that
penetrated
into
his
cell
,
that
he
had
labored
*NL*
uselessly
the
previous
evening
in
attacking
the
stone
instead
of
*NL*
removing
the
plaster
that
surrounded
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
damp
had
rendered
it
friable
,
and
Dantes
was
able
to
break
it
*NL*
off
--
in
small
morsels
,
it
is
true
,
but
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
he
had
*NL*
scraped
off
a
handful
;
a
mathematician
might
have
calculated
that
in
*NL*
two
years
,
supposing
that
the
rock
was
not
encountered
,
a
passage
twenty
*NL*
feet
long
and
two
feet
broad
,
might
be
formed
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prisoner
reproached
himself
with
not
having
thus
employed
the
hours
*NL*
he
had
passed
in
vain
hopes
,
prayer
,
and
despondency
.
During
the
six
*NL*
years
that
he
had
been
imprisoned
,
what
might
he
not
have
accomplished
?
*NL*
*NL*
In
three
days
he
had
succeeded
,
with
the
utmost
precaution
,
in
removing
*NL*
the
cement
,
and
exposing
the
stone-work
.
The
wall
was
built
of
rough
*NL*
stones
,
among
which
,
to
give
strength
to
the
structure
,
blocks
of
hewn
*NL*
stone
were
at
intervals
imbedded
.
It
was
one
of
these
he
had
uncovered
,
*NL*
and
which
he
must
remove
from
its
socket
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dantes
strove
to
do
this
with
his
nails
,
but
they
were
too
weak
.
The
*NL*
fragments
of
the
jug
broke
,
and
after
an
hour
of
useless
toil
,
he
*NL*
paused
.
*NL*
*NL*
Was
he
to
be
thus
stopped
at
the
beginning
,
and
was
he
to
wait
inactive
*NL*
until
his
fellow
workman
had
completed
his
task
?
Suddenly
an
idea
*NL*
occurred
to
him
--
he
smiled
,
and
the
perspiration
dried
on
his
forehead
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
jailer
always
brought
Dantes
'
soup
in
an
iron
saucepan
;
this
*NL*
saucepan
contained
soup
for
both
prisoners
,
for
Dantes
had
noticed
that
*NL*
it
was
either
quite
full
,
or
half
empty
,
according
as
the
turnkey
gave
*NL*
it
to
him
or
to
his
companion
first
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
handle
of
this
saucepan
was
of
iron
;
Dantes
would
have
given
ten
*NL*
years
of
his
life
in
exchange
for
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
jailer
was
accustomed
to
pour
the
contents
of
the
saucepan
into
*NL*
Dantes
'
plate
,
and
Dantes
,
after
eating
his
soup
with
a
wooden
spoon
,
*NL*
washed
the
plate
,
which
thus
served
for
every
day
.
Now
when
evening
*NL*
came
Dantes
put
his
plate
on
the
ground
near
the
door
;
the
jailer
,
as
he
*NL*
entered
,
stepped
on
it
and
broke
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
time
he
could
not
blame
Dantes
.
He
was
wrong
to
leave
it
there
,
but
*NL*
the
jailer
was
wrong
not
to
have
looked
before
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
jailer
,
therefore
,
only
grumbled
.
Then
he
looked
about
for
something
*NL*
to
pour
the
soup
into
;
Dantes
'
entire
dinner
service
consisted
of
one
*NL*
plate
--
there
was
no
alternative
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Leave
the
saucepan
,
''
said
Dantes
;
``
you
can
take
it
away
when
you
bring
*NL*
me
my
breakfast
.
''
This
advice
was
to
the
jailer
's
taste
,
as
it
spared
*NL*
him
the
necessity
of
making
another
trip
.
He
left
the
saucepan
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dantes
was
beside
himself
with
joy
.
He
rapidly
devoured
his
food
,
*NL*
and
after
waiting
an
hour
,
lest
the
jailer
should
change
his
mind
and
*NL*
return
,
he
removed
his
bed
,
took
the
handle
of
the
saucepan
,
inserted
*NL*
the
point
between
the
hewn
stone
and
rough
stones
of
the
wall
,
and
*NL*
employed
it
as
a
lever
.
A
slight
oscillation
showed
Dantes
that
all
*NL*
went
well
.
At
the
end
of
an
hour
the
stone
was
extricated
from
the
wall
,
*NL*
leaving
a
cavity
a
foot
and
a
half
in
diameter
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dantes
carefully
collected
the
plaster
,
carried
it
into
the
corner
of
*NL*
his
cell
,
and
covered
it
with
earth
.
Then
,
wishing
to
make
the
best
*NL*
use
of
his
time
while
he
had
the
means
of
labor
,
he
continued
to
work
*NL*
without
ceasing
.
At
the
dawn
of
day
he
replaced
the
stone
,
pushed
his
*NL*
bed
against
the
wall
,
and
lay
down
.
The
breakfast
consisted
of
a
piece
*NL*
of
bread
;
the
jailer
entered
and
placed
the
bread
on
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
do
n't
you
intend
to
bring
me
another
plate
?
''
said
Dantes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
replied
the
turnkey
;
``
you
destroy
everything
.
First
you
break
your
*NL*
jug
,
then
you
make
me
break
your
plate
;
if
all
the
prisoners
followed
*NL*
your
example
,
the
government
would
be
ruined
.
I
shall
leave
you
the
*NL*
saucepan
,
and
pour
your
soup
into
that
.
So
for
the
future
I
hope
you
*NL*
will
not
be
so
destructive
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dantes
raised
his
eyes
to
heaven
and
clasped
his
hands
beneath
the
*NL*
coverlet
.
He
felt
more
gratitude
for
the
possession
of
this
piece
of
*NL*
iron
than
he
had
ever
felt
for
anything
.
He
had
noticed
,
however
,
that
*NL*
the
prisoner
on
the
other
side
had
ceased
to
labor
;
no
matter
,
this
was
*NL*
a
greater
reason
for
proceeding
--
if
his
neighbor
would
not
come
to
him
,
*NL*
he
would
go
to
his
neighbor
.
All
day
he
toiled
on
untiringly
,
and
by
*NL*
the
evening
he
had
succeeded
in
extracting
ten
handfuls
of
plaster
and
*NL*
fragments
of
stone
.
When
the
hour
for
his
jailer
's
visit
arrived
,
Dantes
*NL*
straightened
the
handle
of
the
saucepan
as
well
as
he
could
,
and
placed
*NL*
it
in
its
accustomed
place
.
The
turnkey
poured
his
ration
of
soup
*NL*
into
it
,
together
with
the
fish
--
for
thrice
a
week
the
prisoners
were
*NL*
deprived
of
meat
.
This
would
have
been
a
method
of
reckoning
time
,
had
*NL*
not
Dantes
long
ceased
to
do
so
.
Having
poured
out
the
soup
,
the
turnkey
*NL*
retired
.
Dantes
wished
to
ascertain
whether
his
neighbor
had
really
*NL*
ceased
to
work
.
He
listened
--
all
was
silent
,
as
it
had
been
for
the
last
*NL*
three
days
.
Dantes
sighed
;
it
was
evident
that
his
neighbor
distrusted
*NL*
him
.
However
,
he
toiled
on
all
the
night
without
being
discouraged
;
but
*NL*
after
two
or
three
hours
he
encountered
an
obstacle
.
The
iron
made
no
*NL*
impression
,
but
met
with
a
smooth
surface
;
Dantes
touched
it
,
and
found
*NL*
that
it
was
a
beam
.
This
beam
crossed
,
or
rather
blocked
up
,
the
hole
*NL*
Dantes
had
made
;
it
was
necessary
,
therefore
,
to
dig
above
or
under
*NL*
it
.
The
unhappy
young
man
had
not
thought
of
this
.
``
O
my
God
,
my
God
!
''
*NL*
murmured
he
,
``
I
have
so
earnestly
prayed
to
you
,
that
I
hoped
my
prayers
*NL*
had
been
heard
.
After
having
deprived
me
of
my
liberty
,
after
having
*NL*
deprived
me
of
death
,
after
having
recalled
me
to
existence
,
my
God
,
*NL*
have
pity
on
me
,
and
do
not
let
me
die
in
despair
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
talks
of
God
and
despair
at
the
same
time
?
''
said
a
voice
that
*NL*
seemed
to
come
from
beneath
the
earth
,
and
,
deadened
by
the
distance
,
*NL*
sounded
hollow
and
sepulchral
in
the
young
man
's
ears
.
Edmond
's
hair
*NL*
stood
on
end
,
and
he
rose
to
his
knees
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
said
he
,
``
I
hear
a
human
voice
.
''
Edmond
had
not
heard
any
one
*NL*
speak
save
his
jailer
for
four
or
five
years
;
and
a
jailer
is
no
man
*NL*
to
a
prisoner
--
he
is
a
living
door
,
a
barrier
of
flesh
and
blood
adding
*NL*
strength
to
restraints
of
oak
and
iron
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
name
of
heaven
,
''
cried
Dantes
,
``
speak
again
,
though
the
sound
of
*NL*
your
voice
terrifies
me
.
Who
are
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
are
you
?
''
said
the
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
unhappy
prisoner
,
''
replied
Dantes
,
who
made
no
hesitation
in
*NL*
answering
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
what
country
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
Frenchman

*NL*
*NL*
``

``

*NL*
*NL*
``
How
long
have
you
been
here
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Since
the
28th
of

*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
innocent

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
of
what
are
you
accused
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
having
conspired
to
aid
the
emperor
's
return

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What

For

's
return

no
longer
on
the
*NL*
throne

then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
abdicated
at
Fontainebleau
in
1814
,
and
was
sent
to
the
Island
*NL*
of
Elba
.
But
how
long
have
you
been
here
that
you
are
ignorant
of
all
*NL*
this
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Since
1811
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dantes
shuddered
;
this
man
had
been
four
years
longer
than
himself
in
*NL*
prison
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
not
dig
any
more
,
''
said
the
voice
;
``
only
tell
me
how
high
up
is
your

*NL*
*NL*
``
On

``
No

``

your

open
on

*NL*
*NL*
``
A

*NL*
*NL*
``
On

*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas
!

murmured
the
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
what
is
the
matter

cried
Dantes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
made
a
mistake
owing
to
an
error

I
took
the
wrong

angle

have
come
out
fifteen
feet
from
where
I
intended

I
took
the
*NL*
wall
you
are
mining
for
the
outer
wall
of
the
fortress

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
then

Yes

.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
mistrust
me
,
then
,
''
said
Dantes
.
Edmond
fancied
he
heard
a
bitter
*NL*
laugh
resounding
from
the
depths
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
am
a
Christian
,
''
cried
Dantes
,
guessing
instinctively
that
this
*NL*
man
meant
to
abandon
him
.
``
I
swear
to
you
by
him
who
died
for
us
that

naught
shall
induce

but
I
*NL*
conjure
you
do
not
abandon
me

If
you
do

I
swear
to
you

I
have
got
*NL*
to
the
end
of
my
strength

that
I
will
dash
my
brains
out
against
the
*NL*
wall

will
have
my
death
to
reproach
yourself
with

*NL*
*NL*
``

of

not
counted

I
do
know
is

that
I
was
just
nineteen
when

was
arrested

the
28th
of
February
,
1815

*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
quite
twenty-six

murmured
the
voice
;
``
at
that
age
he
can
not

traitor

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

no

no

cried
Dantes
.
``
I
swear

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
done
well

I
was

about
to
form
another
plan

leave
you

but
your
age
reassures
me

I

will
not

*NL*
*NL*
``
How
long
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

calculate
our

give

*NL*

not

We
will
escape

and
if
we
can
not

we
will
talk

you
*NL*
of
those
whom
you

I
of
those

I

You
must
love
*NL*
somebody

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

I
am
alone
in

*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
will
love
me

are
young

I
will
be
your
comrade

if

are
old

I
will
be
your

I
have
a
father
who
is
seventy
if
he
yet
*NL*
lives
;
I
only
love
him
and
a
young
girl
called
Mercedes
.
My
father
has
*NL*
not
yet
forgotten
me
,
I
am
sure
,
but
God
alone
knows
if
she
loves
me
*NL*
still

I
shall
love
you
as
I
loved
my

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
well
,
''
returned
the
voice
;
``
to-morrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
These
few
words
were
uttered
with
an
accent
that
left
no
doubt
of
his
*NL*
sincerity
;
Dantes
rose
,
dispersed
the
fragments
with
the
same
precaution
*NL*
as
before
,
and
pushed
his
bed
back
against
the
wall
.
He
then
gave
*NL*
himself
up
to
his
happiness
.
He
would
no
longer
be
alone
.
He
was
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
about
to
regain
his
liberty
;
at
the
worst
,
he
would
have
a
*NL*
companion
,
and
captivity
that
is
shared
is
but
half
captivity
.
Plaints
*NL*
made
in
common
are
almost
prayers
,
and
prayers
where
two
or
three
are
*NL*
gathered
together
invoke
the
mercy
of
heaven
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
day
Dantes
walked
up
and
down
his
cell
.
He
sat
down
occasionally
*NL*
on
his
bed
,
pressing
his
hand
on
his
heart
.
At
the
slightest
noise
he
*NL*
bounded
towards
the
door
.
Once
or
twice
the
thought
crossed
his
mind
*NL*
that
he
might
be
separated
from
this
unknown
,
whom
he
loved
already
;
and
*NL*
then
his
mind
was
made
up
--
when
the
jailer
moved
his
bed
and
stooped
to
*NL*
examine
the
opening
,
he
would
kill
him
with
his
water
jug
.
He
would
be
*NL*
condemned
to
die
,
but
he
was
about
to
die
of
grief
and
despair
when
this
*NL*
miraculous
noise
recalled
him
to
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
jailer
came
in
the
evening
.
Dantes
was
on
his
bed
.
It
seemed
to
him
*NL*
that
thus
he
better
guarded
the
unfinished
opening
.
Doubtless
there
was
*NL*
a
strange
expression
in
his
eyes
,
for
the
jailer
said
,
``
Come
,
are
you
*NL*
going
mad
again
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dantes
did
not
answer
;
he
feared
that
the
emotion
of
his
voice
would
*NL*
betray
him
.
The
jailer
went
away
shaking
his
head
.
Night
came
;
Dantes
*NL*
hoped
that
his
neighbor
would
profit
by
the
silence
to
address
him
,
but
*NL*
he
was
mistaken
.
The
next
morning
,
however
,
just
as
he
removed
his
bed
*NL*
from
the
wall
,
he
heard
three
knocks
;
he
threw
himself
on
his
knees
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
you
?
''
said
he
;
``
I
am
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
your
jailer
gone
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Dantes
;
``
he
will
not
return
until
the
evening
;
so
that
we
*NL*
have
twelve
hours
before
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
work
,
then
?
''
said
the
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
yes
;
this
instant
,
I
entreat
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
moment
that
part
of
the
floor
on
which
Dantes
was
resting
his
two
*NL*
hands
,
as
he
knelt
with
his
head
in
the
opening
,
suddenly
gave
way
;
he
*NL*
drew
back
smartly
,
while
a
mass
of
stones
and
earth
disappeared
in
a
*NL*
hole
that
opened
beneath
the
aperture
he
himself
had
formed
.
Then
from
*NL*
the
bottom
of
this
passage
,
the
depth
of
which
it
was
impossible
to
*NL*
measure
,
he
saw
appear
,
first
the
head
,
then
the
shoulders
,
and
lastly
*NL*
the
body
of
a
man
,
who
sprang
lightly
into
his
cell
.

A
Learned
Italian
.
*NL*
*NL*
Seizing
in
his
arms
the
friend
so
long
and
ardently
desired
,
Dantes
*NL*
almost
carried
him
towards
the
window
,
in
order
to
obtain
a
better
view
*NL*
of
his
features
by
the
aid
of
the
imperfect
light
that
struggled
through
*NL*
the
grating
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
a
man
of
small
stature
,
with
hair
blanched
rather
by
suffering
*NL*
and
sorrow
than
by
age
.
He
had
a
deep-set
,
penetrating
eye
,
almost
*NL*
buried
beneath
the
thick
gray
eyebrow
,
and
a
long
-LRB-
and
still
black
-RRB-
*NL*
beard
reaching
down
to
his
breast
.
His
thin
face
,
deeply
furrowed
by
*NL*
care
,
and
the
bold
outline
of
his
strongly
marked
features
,
betokened
a
*NL*
man
more
accustomed
to
exercise
his
mental
faculties
than
his
physical
*NL*
strength
.
Large
drops
of
perspiration
were
now
standing
on
his
brow
,
*NL*
while
the
garments
that
hung
about
him
were
so
ragged
that
one
could
*NL*
only
guess
at
the
pattern
upon
which
they
had
originally
been
fashioned
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
stranger
might
have
numbered
sixty
or
sixty-five
years
;
but
a
*NL*
certain
briskness
and
appearance
of
vigor
in
his
movements
made
it
*NL*
probable
that
he
was
aged
more
from
captivity
than
the
course
of
time
.
*NL*
He
received
the
enthusiastic
greeting
of
his
young
acquaintance
with
*NL*
evident
pleasure
,
as
though
his
chilled
affections
were
rekindled
and
*NL*
invigorated
by
his
contact
with
one
so
warm
and
ardent
.
He
thanked
him
*NL*
with
grateful
cordiality
for
his
kindly
welcome
,
although
he
must
at
*NL*
that
moment
have
been
suffering
bitterly
to
find
another
dungeon
where
*NL*
he
had
fondly
reckoned
on
discovering
a
means
of
regaining
his
liberty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
first
see
,
''
said
he
,
``
whether
it
is
possible
to
remove
the
*NL*
traces
of
my
entrance
here
--
our
future
tranquillity
depends
upon
our
*NL*
jailers
being
entirely
ignorant
of
it
.
''
Advancing
to
the
opening
,
*NL*
he
stooped
and
raised
the
stone
easily
in
spite
of
its
weight
;
then
,
*NL*
fitting
it
into
its
place
,
he
said
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
removed
this
stone
very
carelessly
;
but
I
suppose
you
had
no
tools
*NL*
to
aid
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
''
exclaimed
Dantes
,
with
astonishment
,
``
do
you
possess
any
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
made
myself
some
;
and
with
the
exception
of
a
file
,
I
have
all
that
*NL*
are
necessary
,
--
a
chisel
,
pincers
,
and
lever
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
how
I
should
like
to
see
these
products
of
your
industry
and
*NL*
patience
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
in
the
first
place
,
here
is
my
chisel
.
''
So
saying
,
he
displayed
a
*NL*
sharp
strong
blade
,
with
a
handle
made
of
beechwood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
with
what
did
you
contrive
to
make
that
?
''
inquired
Dantes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
one
of
the
clamps
of
my
bedstead
;
and
this
very
tool
has
sufficed
*NL*
me
to
hollow
out
the
road
by
which
I
came
hither
,
a
distance
of
about
*NL*
fifty
feet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fifty
feet
!
''
responded
Dantes
,
almost
terrified
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
not
speak
so
loud
,
young
man
--
do
n't
speak
so
loud
.
It
frequently
*NL*
occurs
in
a
state
prison
like
this
,
that
persons
are
stationed
outside
*NL*
the
doors
of
the
cells
purposely
to
overhear
the
conversation
of
the
*NL*
prisoners
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
they
believe
I
am
shut
up
alone
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
makes
no
difference
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
say
that
you
dug
your
way
a
distance
of
fifty
feet
to
get
*NL*
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
;
that
is
about
the
distance
that
separates
your
chamber
from
mine
;
*NL*
only
,
unfortunately
,
I
did
not
curve
aright
;
for
want
of
the
necessary
*NL*
geometrical
instruments
to
calculate
my
scale
of
proportion
,
instead
of
*NL*
taking
an
ellipsis
of
forty
feet
,
I
made
it
fifty
.
I
expected
,
as
I
told
*NL*
you
,
to
reach
the
outer
wall
,
pierce
through
it
,
and
throw
myself
into
*NL*
the
sea
;
I
have
,
however
,
kept
along
the
corridor
on
which
your
chamber
*NL*
opens
,
instead
of
going
beneath
it
.
My
labor
is
all
in
vain
,
for
I
find
*NL*
that
the
corridor
looks
into
a
courtyard
filled
with
soldiers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
true
,
''
said
Dantes
;
``
but
the
corridor
you
speak
of
only
bounds
*NL*
one
side
of
my
cell
;
there
are
three
others
--
do
you
know
anything
of
*NL*
their
situation
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
one
is
built
against
the
solid
rock
,
and
it
would
take
ten
*NL*
experienced
miners
,
duly
furnished
with
the
requisite
tools
,
as
many
*NL*
years
to
perforate
it
.
This
adjoins
the
lower
part
of
the
governor
's
*NL*
apartments
,
and
were
we
to
work
our
way
through
,
we
should
only
get
*NL*
into
some
lock-up
cellars
,
where
we
must
necessarily
be
recaptured
.
The
*NL*
fourth
and
last
side
of
your
cell
faces
on
--
faces
on
--
stop
a
minute
,
now
*NL*
where
does
it
face
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
wall
of
which
he
spoke
was
the
one
in
which
was
fixed
the
loophole
*NL*
by
which
light
was
admitted
to
the
chamber
.
This
loophole
,
which
*NL*
gradually
diminished
in
size
as
it
approached
the
outside
,
to
an
opening
*NL*
through
which
a
child
could
not
have
passed
,
was
,
for
better
security
,
*NL*
furnished
with
three
iron
bars
,
so
as
to
quiet
all
apprehensions
even
*NL*
in
the
mind
of
the
most
suspicious
jailer
as
to
the
possibility
of
a
*NL*
prisoner
's
escape
.
As
the
stranger
asked
the
question
,
he
dragged
the
*NL*
table
beneath
the
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Climb
up
,
''
said
he
to
Dantes
.
The
young
man
obeyed
,
mounted
on
the
*NL*
table
,
and
,
divining
the
wishes
of
his
companion
,
placed
his
back
*NL*
securely
against
the
wall
and
held
out
both
hands
.
The
stranger
,
whom
*NL*
as
yet
Dantes
knew
only
by
the
number
of
his
cell
,
sprang
up
with
an
*NL*
agility
by
no
means
to
be
expected
in
a
person
of
his
years
,
and
,
light
*NL*
and
steady
on
his
feet
as
a
cat
or
a
lizard
,
climbed
from
the
table
to
*NL*
the
outstretched
hands
of
Dantes
,
and
from
them
to
his
shoulders
;
*NL*
then
,
bending
double
,
for
the
ceiling
of
the
dungeon
prevented
him
from
*NL*
holding
himself
erect
,
he
managed
to
slip
his
head
between
the
upper
*NL*
bars
of
the
window
,
so
as
to
be
able
to
command
a
perfect
view
from
top
*NL*
to
bottom
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
instant
afterwards
he
hastily
drew
back
his
head
,
saying
,
``
I
thought
*NL*
so
!
''
and
sliding
from
the
shoulders
of
Dantes
as
dextrously
as
he
had
*NL*
ascended
,
he
nimbly
leaped
from
the
table
to
the
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
was
it
that
you
thought
?
''
asked
the
young
man
anxiously
,
in
his
*NL*
turn
descending
from
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
elder
prisoner
pondered
the
matter
.
``
Yes
,
''
said
he
at
length
,
``
it
*NL*
is
so
.
This
side
of
your
chamber
looks
out
upon
a
kind
of
open
gallery
,
*NL*
where
patrols
are
continually
passing
,
and
sentries
keep
watch
day
and
*NL*
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
quite
sure
of
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certain
.
I
saw
the
soldier
's
shape
and
the
top
of
his
musket
;
that
made
*NL*
me
draw
in
my
head
so
quickly
,
for
I
was
fearful
he
might
also
see
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
inquired
Dantes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
perceive
then
the
utter
impossibility
of
escaping
through
your
*NL*
dungeon
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
''
pursued
the
young
man
eagerly
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
''
answered
the
elder
prisoner
,
``
the
will
of
God
be
done
!
''
and
*NL*
as
the
old
man
slowly
pronounced
those
words
,
an
air
of
profound
*NL*
resignation
spread
itself
over
his
careworn
countenance
.
Dantes
gazed
on
*NL*
the
man
who
could
thus
philosophically
resign
hopes
so
long
and
ardently
*NL*
nourished
with
an
astonishment
mingled
with
admiration
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
,
I
entreat
of
you
,
who
and
what
you
are
?
''
said
he
at
length
;
*NL*
``
never
have
I
met
with
so
remarkable
a
person
as
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Willingly
,
''
answered
the
stranger
;
``
if
,
indeed
,
you
feel
any
curiosity
*NL*
respecting
one
,
now
,
alas
,
powerless
to
aid
you
in
any
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
not
so
;
you
can
console
and
support
me
by
the
strength
of
your
own
*NL*
powerful
mind
.
Pray
let
me
know
who
you
really
are
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
stranger
smiled
a
melancholy
smile
.
``
Then
listen
,
''
said
he
.
``
I
am
*NL*
the
Abbe
Faria
,
and
have
been
imprisoned
as
you
know
in
this
Chateau
*NL*
d'If
since
the
year
1811
;
previously
to
which
I
had
been
confined
for
*NL*
three
years
in
the
fortress
of
Fenestrelle
.
In
the
year
1811
I
was
*NL*
transferred
to
Piedmont
in
France
.
It
was
at
this
period
I
learned
that
*NL*
the
destiny
which
seemed
subservient
to
every
wish
formed
by
Napoleon
,
*NL*
had
bestowed
on
him
a
son
,
named
king
of
Rome
even
in
his
cradle
.
I
was
*NL*
very
far
then
from
expecting
the
change
you
have
just
informed
me
of
;
*NL*
namely
,
that
four
years
afterwards
,
this
colossus
of
power
would
be
*NL*
overthrown
.
Then
who
reigns
in
France
at
this
moment
--
Napoleon
II
.
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Louis
XVIII
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
brother
of
Louis
XVII
.
!
How
inscrutable
are
the
ways
of
*NL*
providence
--
for
what
great
and
mysterious
purpose
has
it
pleased
heaven
*NL*
to
abase
the
man
once
so
elevated
,
and
raise
up
him
who
was
so
abased
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dantes
'
whole
attention
was
riveted
on
a
man
who
could
thus
forget
his
*NL*
own
misfortunes
while
occupying
himself
with
the
destinies
of
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
''
continued
he
,
''
`
Twill
be
the
same
as
it
was
in
England
.
*NL*
After
Charles
I.
,
Cromwell
;
after
Cromwell
,
Charles
II.
,
and
then
James
*NL*
II.
,
and
then
some
son-in-law
or
relation
,
some
Prince
of
Orange
,
a
*NL*
stadtholder
who
becomes
a
king
.
Then
new
concessions
to
the
people
,
then
*NL*
a
constitution
,
then
liberty
.
Ah
,
my
friend
!
''
said
the
abbe
,
turning
*NL*
towards
Dantes
,
and
surveying
him
with
the
kindling
gaze
of
a
prophet
,
*NL*
``
you
are
young
,
you
will
see
all
this
come
to
pass
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Probably
,
if
ever
I
get
out
of
prison
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
True
,
''
replied
Faria
,
``
we
are
prisoners
;
but
I
forget
this
sometimes
,
*NL*
and
there
are
even
moments
when
my
mental
vision
transports
me
beyond
*NL*
these
walls
,
and
I
fancy
myself
at
liberty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
wherefore
are
you
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
in
1807
I
dreamed
of
the
very
plan
Napoleon
tried
to
realize
in
*NL*
1811
;
because
,
like
Machiavelli
,
I
desired
to
alter
the
political
face
*NL*
of
Italy
,
and
instead
of
allowing
it
to
be
split
up
into
a
quantity
*NL*
of
petty
principalities
,
each
held
by
some
weak
or
tyrannical
ruler
,
*NL*
I
sought
to
form
one
large
,
compact
,
and
powerful
empire
;
and
,
lastly
,
*NL*
because
I
fancied
I
had
found
my
Caesar
Borgia
in
a
crowned
simpleton
,
*NL*
who
feigned
to
enter
into
my
views
only
to
betray
me
.
It
was
the
plan
of
*NL*
Alexander
VI
.
and
Clement
VII.
,
but
it
will
never
succeed
now
,
for
they
*NL*
attempted
it
fruitlessly
,
and
Napoleon
was
unable
to
complete
his
work
.
*NL*
Italy
seems
fated
to
misfortune
.
''
And
the
old
man
bowed
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dantes
could
not
understand
a
man
risking
his
life
for
such
matters
.
*NL*
Napoleon
certainly
he
knew
something
of
,
inasmuch
as
he
had
seen
and
*NL*
spoken
with
him
;
but
of
Clement
VII
.
and
Alexander
VI
.
he
knew
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
not
,
''
he
asked
,
``
the
priest
who
here
in
the
Chateau
d'If
is
*NL*
generally
thought
to
be
--
ill
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mad
,
you
mean
,
do
n't
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
not
like
to
say
so
,
''
answered
Dantes
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
''
resumed
Faria
with
a
bitter
smile
,
``
let
me
answer
your
*NL*
question
in
full
,
by
acknowledging
that
I
am
the
poor
mad
prisoner
*NL*
of
the
Chateau
d'If
,
for
many
years
permitted
to
amuse
the
different
*NL*
visitors
with
what
is
said
to
be
my
insanity
;
and
,
in
all
probability
,
*NL*
I
should
be
promoted
to
the
honor
of
making
sport
for
the
children
,
if
*NL*
such
innocent
beings
could
be
found
in
an
abode
devoted
like
this
to
*NL*
suffering
and
despair
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dantes
remained
for
a
short
time
mute
and
motionless
;
at
length
he
*NL*
said
,
--
``
Then
you
abandon
all
hope
of
escape
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
perceive
its
utter
impossibility

I
consider
it
impious
to

attempt
that
which
the
Almighty
evidently
does
not
approve

*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
be
not
discouraged

Would
it
not
be
expecting
too
much
to
hope
to
*NL*
succeed
at
your
first
attempt
?
Why
not
try
to
find
an
opening
in
another
*NL*
direction
from
that
which
has
so
unfortunately
failed
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas
,
it
shows
how
little
notion
you
can
have
of
all

has
cost
me
to
*NL*
effect
a
purpose
so
unexpectedly
frustrated
,
that
you
talk
of
beginning
*NL*
over
again
.
In
the
first
place
,
I
was
four
years
making
the
tools
I
*NL*
possess
,
and
have
been
two
years
scraping
and
digging
out
earth
,
hard
*NL*
as
granite
itself
;
then
what
toil
and
fatigue
has
it
not
been
to
remove
*NL*
huge
stones
I
should
once
have
deemed
impossible
to
loosen
.
Whole
days
*NL*
have
I
passed
in
these
Titanic
efforts
,
considering
my
labor
well
repaid
*NL*
if
,
by
night-time
I
had
contrived
to
carry
away
a
square
inch
of
this
*NL*
hard-bound
cement
,
changed
by
ages
into
a
substance
unyielding
as
the
*NL*
stones
themselves
;
then
to
conceal
the
mass
of
earth
and
rubbish
I
dug
*NL*
up
,
I
was
compelled
to
break
through
a
staircase
,
and
throw
the
*NL*
fruits
of
my
labor
into
the
hollow
part
of
it
;
but
the
well
is
now
so
*NL*
completely
choked
up
,
that
I
scarcely
think
it
would
be
possible
to
add
*NL*
another
handful
of
dust
without
leading
to
discovery
.
Consider
also
that
*NL*
I
fully
believed
I
had
accomplished
the
end
and
aim
of
my
undertaking
,
*NL*
for
which
I
had
so
exactly
husbanded
my
strength
as
to
make
it
just
hold
*NL*
out
to
the
termination
of
my
enterprise
;
and
now
,
at
the
moment
when
I
*NL*
reckoned
upon
success
,
my
hopes
are
forever
dashed
from
me
.
No
,
I
repeat
*NL*
again
,
that
nothing
shall
induce
me
to
renew
attempts
evidently
at
*NL*
variance
with
the
Almighty
's
pleasure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dantes
held
down
his
head
,
that
the
other
might
not
see
how
joy
at
the
*NL*
thought
of
having
a
companion
outweighed
the
sympathy
he
felt
for
the
*NL*
failure
of
the
abbe
's
plans
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
abbe
sank
upon
Edmond
's
bed
,
while
Edmond
himself
remained
standing
.
*NL*
Escape
had
never
once
occurred
to
him
.
There
are
,
indeed
,
some
things
*NL*
which
appear
so
impossible
that
the
mind
does
not
dwell
on
them
for
an
*NL*
instant
.
To
undermine
the
ground
for
fifty
feet
--
to
devote
three
years
*NL*
to
a
labor
which
,
if
successful
,
would
conduct
you
to
a
precipice
*NL*
overhanging
the
sea
--
to
plunge
into
the
waves
from
the
height
of
fifty
,
*NL*
sixty
,
perhaps
a
hundred
feet
,
at
the
risk
of
being
dashed
to
pieces
*NL*
against
the
rocks
,
should
you
have
been
fortunate
enough
to
have
escaped
*NL*
the
fire
of
the
sentinels
;
and
even
,
supposing
all
these
perils
past
,
*NL*
then
to
have
to
swim
for
your
life
a
distance
of
at
least
three
miles
*NL*
ere
you
could
reach
the
shore
--
were
difficulties
so
startling
and
*NL*
formidable
that
Dantes
had
never
even
dreamed
of
such
a
scheme
,
*NL*
resigning
himself
rather
to
death
.
But
the
sight
of
an
old
man
clinging
*NL*
to
life
with
so
desperate
a
courage
,
gave
a
fresh
turn
to
his
ideas
,
and
*NL*
inspired
him
with
new
courage
.
Another
,
older
and
less
strong
than
he
,
*NL*
had
attempted
what
he
had
not
had
sufficient
resolution
to
undertake
,
*NL*
and
had
failed
only
because
of
an
error
in
calculation
.
This
same
*NL*
person
,
with
almost
incredible
patience
and
perseverance
,
had
contrived
*NL*
to
provide
himself
with
tools
requisite
for
so
unparalleled
an
attempt
.
*NL*
Another
had
done
all
this
;
why
,
then
,
was
it
impossible
to
Dantes
?
Faria
*NL*
had
dug
his
way
through
fifty
feet
,
Dantes
would
dig
a
hundred
;
Faria
,
*NL*
at
the
age
of
fifty
,
had
devoted
three
years
to
the
task
;
he
,
who
was
*NL*
but
half
as
old
,
would
sacrifice
six
;
Faria
,
a
priest
and
savant
,
*NL*
had
not
shrunk
from
the
idea
of
risking
his
life
by
trying
to
swim
a
*NL*
distance
of
three
miles
to
one
of
the
islands
--
Daume
,
Rattonneau
,
or
*NL*
Lemaire
;
should
a
hardy
sailer
,
an
experienced
diver
,
like
himself
,
*NL*
shrink
from
a
similar
task
;
should
he
,
who
had
so
often
for
mere
*NL*
amusement
's
sake
plunged
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea
to
fetch
up
the
bright
*NL*
coral
branch
,
hesitate
to
entertain
the
same
project
?
He
could
do
it
in
*NL*
an
hour
,
and
how
many
times
had
he
,
for
pure
pastime
,
continued
in
the
*NL*
water
for
more
than
twice
as
long
!
At
once
Dantes
resolved
to
follow
the
*NL*
brave
example
of
his
energetic
companion
,
and
to
remember
that
what
has
*NL*
once
been
done
may
be
done
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
continuing
some
time
in
profound
meditation
,
the
young
man
*NL*
suddenly
exclaimed
,
``
I
have
found
what
you
were
in
search
of
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Faria
started
:
``
Have
you
,
indeed
?
''
cried
he
,
raising
his
head
with
quick
*NL*
anxiety
;
``
pray
,
let
me
know
what
it
is
you
have
discovered
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
corridor
through
which
you
have
bored
your
way
from
the
cell
you
*NL*
occupy
here
,
extends
in
the
same
direction
as
the
outer
gallery
,
does
it
*NL*
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
does
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
is
not
above
fifteen
feet
from
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
About
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
I
will
tell
you
what
we
must
do
.
We
must
pierce
through
the
*NL*
corridor
by
forming
a
side
opening
about
the
middle
,
as
it
were
the
top
*NL*
part
of
a
cross
.
This
time
you
will
lay
your
plans
more
accurately
;
we
*NL*
shall
get
out
into
the
gallery
you
have
described
;
kill
the
sentinel
*NL*
who
guards
it
,
and
make
our
escape
.
All
we
require
to
insure
success
is
*NL*
courage
,
and
that
you
possess
,
and
strength
,
which
I
am
not
deficient
*NL*
in
;
as
for
patience
,
you
have
abundantly
proved
yours
--
you
shall
now
see
*NL*
me
prove
mine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
instant
,
my
dear
friend
,
''
replied
the
abbe
;
``
it
is
clear
you
do
not
*NL*
understand
the
nature
of
the
courage
with
which
I
am
endowed
,
and
what
*NL*
use
I
intend
making
of
my
strength
.
As
for
patience
,
I
consider
that
I
*NL*
have
abundantly
exercised
that
in
beginning
every
morning
the
task
of
*NL*
the
night
before
,
and
every
night
renewing
the
task
of
the
day
.
But
*NL*
then
,
young
man
-LRB-
and
I
pray
of
you
to
give
me
your
full
attention
-RRB-
,
then
*NL*
I
thought
I
could
not
be
doing
anything
displeasing
to
the
Almighty
in
*NL*
trying
to
set
an
innocent
being
at
liberty
--
one
who
had
committed
no
*NL*
offence
,
and
merited
not
condemnation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
have
your
notions
changed
?
''
asked
Dantes
with
much
surprise
;
``
do
*NL*
you
think
yourself
more
guilty
in
making
the
attempt
since
you
have
*NL*
encountered
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
neither
do
I
wish
to
incur
guilt
.
Hitherto
I
have
fancied
myself
*NL*
merely
waging
war
against
circumstances
,
not
men
.
I
have
thought
it
*NL*
no
sin
to
bore
through
a
wall
,
or
destroy
a
staircase
;
but
I
can
not
so
*NL*
easily
persuade
myself
to
pierce
a
heart
or
take
away
a
life
.
''
A
slight
*NL*
movement
of
surprise
escaped
Dantes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
possible
,
''
said
he
,
``
that
where
your
liberty
is
at
stake
you
can
*NL*
allow
any
such
scruple
to
deter
you
from
obtaining
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
,
''
replied
Faria
,
``
what
has
hindered
you
from
knocking
down
your
*NL*
jailer
with
a
piece
of
wood
torn
from
your
bedstead
,
dressing
yourself
*NL*
in
his
clothes
,
and
endeavoring
to
escape
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Simply
the
fact
that
the
idea
never
occurred
to
me
,
''
answered
Dantes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
,
''
said
the
old
man
,
``
the
natural
repugnance
to
the
commission
*NL*
of
such
a
crime
prevented
you
from
thinking
of
it
;
and
so
it
ever
is
*NL*
because
in
simple
and
allowable
things
our
natural
instincts
keep
us
*NL*
from
deviating
from
the
strict
line
of
duty
.
The
tiger
,
whose
nature
*NL*
teaches
him
to
delight
in
shedding
blood
,
needs
but
the
sense
of
smell
*NL*
to
show
him
when
his
prey
is
within
his
reach
,
and
by
following
this
*NL*
instinct
he
is
enabled
to
measure
the
leap
necessary
to
permit
him
to
*NL*
spring
on
his
victim
;
but
man
,
on
the
contrary
,
loathes
the
idea
of
*NL*
blood
--
it
is
not
alone
that
the
laws
of
social
life
inspire
him
with
*NL*
a
shrinking
dread
of
taking
life
;
his
natural
construction
and
*NL*
physiological
formation
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
Dantes
was
confused
and
silent
at
this
explanation
of
the
thoughts
which
*NL*
had
unconsciously
been
working
in
his
mind
,
or
rather
soul
;
for
there
*NL*
are
two
distinct
sorts
of
ideas
,
those
that
proceed
from
the
head
and
*NL*
those
that
emanate
from
the
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Since
my
imprisonment
,
''
said
Faria
,
``
I
have
thought
over
all
the
most
*NL*
celebrated
cases
of
escape
on
record
.
They
have
rarely
been
successful
.
*NL*
Those
that
have
been
crowned
with
full
success
have
been
long
meditated
*NL*
upon
,
and
carefully
arranged
;
such
,
for
instance
,
as
the
escape
of
the
*NL*
Duc
de
Beaufort
from
the
Chateau
de
Vincennes
,
that
of
the
Abbe
Dubuquoi
*NL*
from
For
l'Eveque
;
of
Latude
from
the
Bastille
.
Then
there
are
those
for
*NL*
which
chance
sometimes
affords
opportunity
,
and
those
are
the
best
of
*NL*
all
.
Let
us
,
therefore
,
wait
patiently
for
some
favorable
moment
,
and
*NL*
when
it
presents
itself
,
profit
by
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
said
Dantes
,
``
you
might
well
endure
the
tedious
delay
;
you
were
*NL*
constantly
employed
in
the
task
you
set
yourself
,
and
when
weary
with
*NL*
toil
,
you
had
your
hopes
to
refresh
and
encourage
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
assure
you
,
''
replied
the
old
man
,
``
I
did
not
turn
to
that
source
for
*NL*
recreation
or
support
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
did
you
do
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wrote

studied

*NL*
*NL*
``
Were
you
then
permitted
the
use
of
pens

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

no

answered
the
abbe
;
``
I
had
none

what
I
made

``
You

*NL*

``
Yes

*NL*
*NL*
Dantes
gazed
with
admiration
,
but
he
had
some
difficulty
in
believing
.
*NL*
Faria
saw
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
you
pay
me
a
visit
in
my
cell
,
my
young
friend

''
said
he
,
``
I
will
*NL*
show
you
an
entire
work

the
fruits
of
the
thoughts

reflections
of
*NL*
my
whole
life
;
many
of
them
meditated
over
in
the
shades
of
the
Colosseum
*NL*
at
Rome
,
at
the
foot
of
St.
Mark
's
column
at
Venice

on
the
borders

of

Arno
at
Florence

little
imagining
at
the
time
that
they
would
be
*NL*
arranged
in
order
within
the
walls
of
the
Chateau
d'If

The
work
I
speak
*NL*
of
is
called
'
A
Treatise
on
the
Possibility
of
a
General
Monarchy
in

``
On
two
of

I
invented

But
for
such
a

you
must

any

*NL*

``
I
had
nearly
five
thousand
volumes
in
my
library
at

but
after

reading
them
over
many

I
found
out

fifty
well-chosen

a
complete
summary

all

I
devoted

three
years

to
reading

studying
these
one
hundred

fifty
volumes

I
knew

so
that
since
I
have

a
very
slight

of
memory
has
enabled

to
recall

readily

Why

I
made
a

turned

arranged
them

so
as
to
enable

I
can
not

I

certainly
should
have
no

ever
require
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Stronger
grew
the
wonder
of
Dantes
,
who
almost
fancied
he
had
to
do
*NL*
with
one
gifted
with
supernatural
powers
;
still
hoping
to
find
some
*NL*
imperfection
which
might
bring
him
down
to
a
level
with
human
beings
,
he
*NL*
added
,
``
Then
if
you
were
not
furnished
with
pens
,
how
did
you
manage
to
*NL*
write
the
work
you
speak
of
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
made
myself
some
excellent
ones
,
which
would
be
universally
preferred
*NL*
to
all
others
if
once
known
.
You
are
aware
what
huge
whitings
are
served
*NL*
to
us
on
maigre
days
.
Well
,
I
selected
the
cartilages
of
the
heads
of
*NL*
these
fishes
,
and
you
can
scarcely
imagine
the
delight
with
which
*NL*
I
welcomed
the
arrival
of
each
Wednesday
,
Friday
,
and
Saturday
,
as
*NL*
affording
me
the
means
of
increasing
my
stock
of
pens
;
for
I
will
freely
*NL*
confess
that
my
historical
labors
have
been
my
greatest
solace
and
*NL*
relief
.
While
retracing
the
past
,
I
forget
the
present
;
and
traversing
*NL*
at
will
the
path
of
history
I
cease
to
remember
that
I
am
myself
a
*NL*
prisoner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
the
ink
,
''
said
Dantes
;
``
of
what
did
you
make
your
ink
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
was
formerly
a
fireplace
in
my
dungeon
,
''
replied
Faria
,
``
but
it
*NL*
was
closed
up
long
ere
I
became
an
occupant
of
this
prison
.
Still
,
it
*NL*
must
have
been
many
years
in
use
,
for
it
was
thickly
covered
with
a
*NL*
coating
of
soot
;
this
soot
I
dissolved
in
a
portion
of
the
wine
brought
*NL*
to
me
every
Sunday
,
and
I
assure
you
a
better
ink
can
not
be
desired
.
For
*NL*
very
important
notes
,
for
which
closer
attention
is
required
,
I
pricked
*NL*
one
of
my
fingers
,
and
wrote
with
my
own
blood
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
when
,
''
asked
Dantes
,
``
may
I
see
all
this
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whenever
you
please
,
''
replied
the
abbe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
then
let
it
be
directly
!
''
exclaimed
the
young
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Follow
me
,
then
,
''
said
the
abbe
,
as
he
re-entered
the
subterranean
*NL*
passage
,
in
which
he
soon
disappeared
,
followed
by
Dantes
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
17
.
The
Abbe
's
Chamber
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
having
passed
with
tolerable
ease
through
the
subterranean
*NL*
passage
,
which
,
however
,
did
not
admit
of
their
holding
themselves
*NL*
erect
,
the
two
friends
reached
the
further
end
of
the
corridor
,
into
*NL*
which
the
abbe
's
cell
opened
;
from
that
point
the
passage
became
much
*NL*
narrower
,
and
barely
permitted
one
to
creep
through
on
hands
and
knees
.
*NL*
The
floor
of
the
abbe
's
cell
was
paved
,
and
it
had
been
by
raising
one
*NL*
of
the
stones
in
the
most
obscure
corner
that
Faria
had
to
been
able
*NL*
to
commence
the
laborious
task
of
which
Dantes
had
witnessed
the
*NL*
completion
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
entered
the
chamber
of
his
friend
,
Dantes
cast
around
one
eager
*NL*
and
searching
glance
in
quest
of
the
expected
marvels
,
but
nothing
more
*NL*
than
common
met
his
view
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
well
,
''
said
the
abbe
;
``
we
have
some
hours
before
us
--
it
is
now
*NL*
just
a
quarter
past
twelve
o'clock
.
''
Instinctively
Dantes
turned
round
*NL*
to
observe
by
what
watch
or
clock
the
abbe
had
been
able
so
accurately
*NL*
to
specify
the
hour
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
at
this
ray
of
light
which
enters
by
my
window
,
''
said
the
abbe
,
*NL*
``
and
then
observe
the
lines
traced
on
the
wall
.
Well
,
by
means
of
these
*NL*
lines
,
which
are
in
accordance
with
the
double
motion
of
the
earth
,
and
*NL*
the
ellipse
it
describes
round
the
sun
,
I
am
enabled
to
ascertain
the
*NL*
precise
hour
with
more
minuteness
than
if
I
possessed
a
watch
;
for
that
*NL*
might
be
broken
or
deranged
in
its
movements
,
while
the
sun
and
earth
*NL*
never
vary
in
their
appointed
paths
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
last
explanation
was
wholly
lost
upon
Dantes
,
who
had
always
*NL*
imagined
,
from
seeing
the
sun
rise
from
behind
the
mountains
and
set
in
*NL*
the
Mediterranean
,
that
it
moved
,
and
not
the
earth
.
A
double
movement
*NL*
of
the
globe
he
inhabited
,
and
of
which
he
could
feel
nothing
,
appeared
*NL*
to
him
perfectly
impossible
.
Each
word
that
fell
from
his
companion
's
*NL*
lips
seemed
fraught
with
the
mysteries
of
science
,
as
worthy
of
digging
*NL*
out
as
the
gold
and
diamonds
in
the
mines
of
Guzerat
and
Golconda
,
*NL*
which
he
could
just
recollect
having
visited
during
a
voyage
made
in
his
*NL*
earliest
youth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
''
said
he
to
the
abbe
,
``
I
am
anxious
to
see
your
treasures
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
abbe
smiled
,
and
,
proceeding
to
the
disused
fireplace
,
raised
,
*NL*
by
the
help
of
his
chisel
,
a
long
stone
,
which
had
doubtless
been
the
*NL*
hearth
,
beneath
which
was
a
cavity
of
considerable
depth
,
serving
as
a
*NL*
safe
depository
of
the
articles
mentioned
to
Dantes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
wish
to
see
first
?
''
asked
the
abbe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
your
great
work
on
the
monarchy
of
Italy
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Faria
then
drew
forth
from
his
hiding-place
three
or
four
rolls
of
*NL*
linen
,
laid
one
over
the
other
,
like
folds
of
papyrus
.
These
rolls
*NL*
consisted
of
slips
of
cloth
about
four
inches
wide
and
eighteen
long
;
*NL*
they
were
all
carefully
numbered
and
closely
covered
with
writing
,
*NL*
so
legible
that
Dantes
could
easily
read
it
,
as
well
as
make
out
the
*NL*
sense
--
it
being
in
Italian
,
a
language
he
,
as
a
Provencal
,
perfectly
*NL*
understood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
''
said
he
,
``
there
is
the
work
complete
.
I
wrote
the
word
finis
at
*NL*
the
end
of
the
sixty-eighth
strip
about
a
week
ago
.
I
have
torn
up
two
*NL*
of
my
shirts
,
and
as
many
handkerchiefs
as
I
was
master
of
,
to
complete
*NL*
the
precious
pages
.
Should
I
ever
get
out
of
prison
and
find
in
all
*NL*
Italy
a
printer
courageous
enough
to
publish
what
I
have
composed
,
my
*NL*
literary
reputation
is
forever
secured
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
,
''
answered
Dantes
.
``
Now
let
me
behold
the
curious
pens
with
which
*NL*
you
have
written
your
work
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
!
''
said
Faria
,
showing
to
the
young
man
a
slender
stick
about
*NL*
six
inches
long
,
and
much
resembling
the
size
of
the
handle
of
a
fine
*NL*
painting-brush
,
to
the
end
of
which
was
tied
,
by
a
piece
of
thread
,
one
*NL*
of
those
cartilages
of
which
the
abbe
had
before
spoken
to
Dantes
;
*NL*
it
was
pointed
,
and
divided
at
the
nib
like
an
ordinary
pen
.
Dantes
*NL*
examined
it
with
intense
admiration
,
then
looked
around
to
see
the
*NL*
instrument
with
which
it
had
been
shaped
so
correctly
into
form
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
yes
,
''
said
Faria
;
``
the
penknife
.
That
's
my
masterpiece
.
I
made
*NL*
it
,
as
well
as
this
larger
knife
,
out
of
an
old
iron
candlestick
.
''
The
*NL*
penknife
was
sharp
and
keen
as
a
razor
;
as
for
the
other
knife
,
it
would
*NL*
serve
a
double
purpose
,
and
with
it
one
could
cut
and
thrust
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dantes
examined
the
various
articles
shown
to
him
with
the
same
*NL*
attention
that
he
had
bestowed
on
the
curiosities
and
strange
tools
*NL*
exhibited
in
the
shops
at
Marseilles
as
the
works
of
the
savages
in
the
*NL*
South
Seas
from
whence
they
had
been
brought
by
the
different
trading
*NL*
vessels
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
for
the
ink
,
''
said
Faria
,
``
I
told
you
how
I
managed
to
obtain
*NL*
that
--
and
I
only
just
make
it
from
time
to
time
,
as
I
require
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
thing
still
puzzles
me
,
''
observed
Dantes
,
``
and
that
is
how
you
*NL*
managed
to
do
all
this
by
daylight
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
worked
at
night
also
,
''
replied
Faria
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Night
!
--
why
,
for
heaven
's
sake
,
are
your
eyes
like
cats
'
,
that
you
can
*NL*
see
to
work
in
the
dark
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
they
are
not
;
but
God
has
supplied
man
with
the
intelligence
*NL*
that
enables
him
to
overcome
the
limitations
of
natural
conditions
.
I
*NL*
furnished
myself
with
a
light
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
did
?
Pray
tell
me
how
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
separated
the
fat
from
the
meat
served
to
me
,
melted
it
,
and
so
made
*NL*
oil
--
here
is
my
lamp
.
''
So
saying
,
the
abbe
exhibited
a
sort
of
torch
*NL*
very
similar
to
those
used
in
public
illuminations
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
light
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
are
two
flints
and
a
piece
of
burnt
linen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
matches
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
pretended
that
I
had
a
disorder
of
the
skin
,
and
asked
for
a
little
*NL*
sulphur
,
which
was
readily
supplied
.
''
Dantes
laid
the
different
things
*NL*
he
had
been
looking
at
on
the
table
,
and
stood
with
his
head
drooping
*NL*
on
his
breast
,
as
though
overwhelmed
by
the
perseverance
and
strength
of
*NL*
Faria
's
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
not
seen
all
yet
,
''
continued
Faria
,
``
for
I
did
not
think
it
*NL*
wise
to
trust
all
my
treasures
in
the
same
hiding-place
.
Let
us
shut
*NL*
this
one
up
.
''
They
put
the
stone
back
in
its
place
;
the
abbe
sprinkled
*NL*
a
little
dust
over
it
to
conceal
the
traces
of
its
having
been
removed
,
*NL*
rubbed
his
foot
well
on
it
to
make
it
assume
the
same
appearance
as
the
*NL*
other
,
and
then
,
going
towards
his
bed
,
he
removed
it
from
the
spot
it
*NL*
stood
in
.
Behind
the
head
of
the
bed
,
and
concealed
by
a
stone
fitting
*NL*
in
so
closely
as
to
defy
all
suspicion
,
was
a
hollow
space
,
and
in
this
*NL*
space
a
ladder
of
cords
between
twenty-five
and
thirty
feet
in
length
.
*NL*
Dantes
closely
and
eagerly
examined
it
;
he
found
it
firm
,
solid
,
and
*NL*
compact
enough
to
bear
any
weight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
supplied
you
with
the
materials
for
making
this
wonderful
work
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
tore
up
several
of
my
shirts
,
and
ripped
out
the
seams
in
the
sheets
*NL*
of
my
bed
,
during
my
three
years
'
imprisonment
at
Fenestrelle
;
and
when
*NL*
I
was
removed
to
the
Chateau
d'If
,
I
managed
to
bring
the
ravellings
*NL*
with
me
,
so
that
I
have
been
able
to
finish
my
work
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
was
it
not
discovered
that
your
sheets
were
unhemmed
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
for
when
I
had
taken
out
the
thread
I
required
,
I
hemmed
the
*NL*
edges
over
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
this
needle
,
''
said
the
abbe
,
as
,
opening
his
ragged
vestments
,
he
*NL*
showed
Dantes
a
long
,
sharp
fish-bone
,
with
a
small
perforated
eye
*NL*
for
the
thread
,
a
small
portion
of
which
still
remained
in
it
.
``
I
once
*NL*
thought
,
''
continued
Faria
,
``
of
removing
these
iron
bars
,
and
letting
*NL*
myself
down
from
the
window
,
which
,
as
you
see
,
is
somewhat
wider
than
*NL*
yours
,
although
I
should
have
enlarged
it
still
more
preparatory
to
my
*NL*
flight
;
however
,
I
discovered
that
I
should
merely
have
dropped
into
a
*NL*
sort
of
inner
court
,
and
I
therefore
renounced
the
project
altogether
*NL*
as
too
full
of
risk
and
danger
.
Nevertheless
,
I
carefully
preserved
my
*NL*
ladder
against
one
of
those
unforeseen
opportunities
of
which
I
spoke
*NL*
just
now
,
and
which
sudden
chance
frequently
brings
about
.
''
While
*NL*
affecting
to
be
deeply
engaged
in
examining
the
ladder
,
the
mind
of
*NL*
Dantes
was
,
in
fact
,
busily
occupied
by
the
idea
that
a
person
so
*NL*
intelligent
,
ingenious
,
and
clear-sighted
as
the
abbe
might
probably
be
*NL*
able
to
solve
the
dark
mystery
of
his
own
misfortunes
,
where
he
himself
*NL*
could
see
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
thinking
of
?
''
asked
the
abbe
smilingly
,
imputing
the
deep
*NL*
abstraction
in
which
his
visitor
was
plunged
to
the
excess
of
his
awe
*NL*
and
wonder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
reflecting
,
in
the
first
place
,
''
replied
Dantes
,
``
upon
the
*NL*
enormous
degree
of
intelligence
and
ability
you
must
have
employed
to
*NL*
reach
the
high
perfection
to
which
you
have
attained
.
What
would
you
not
*NL*
have
accomplished
if
you
had
been
free
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Possibly
nothing
at
all
;
the
overflow
of
my
brain
would
probably
,
in
a
*NL*
state
of
freedom
,
have
evaporated
in
a
thousand
follies
;
misfortune
*NL*
is
needed
to
bring
to
light
the
treasures
of
the
human
intellect
.
*NL*
Compression
is
needed
to
explode
gunpowder
.
Captivity
has
brought
*NL*
my
mental
faculties
to
a
focus
;
and
you
are
well
aware
that
from
*NL*
the
collision
of
clouds
electricity
is
produced
--
from
electricity
,
*NL*
lightning
,
from
lightning
,
illumination
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
replied
Dantes
.
``
I
know
nothing
.
Some
of
your
words
are
to
me
*NL*
quite
empty
of
meaning
.
You
must
be
blessed
indeed
to
possess
the
*NL*
knowledge
you
have
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
abbe
smiled
.
``
Well
,
''
said
he
,
``
but
you
had
another
subject

It

all

Your

through
any
very
important
events

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
has
been
long
enough

inflict
on

undeserved

it
on

no

longer
vent

*NL*
``

*NL*

I
do

indeed

this
I

my

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come

''
said
the
abbe
,
closing
his
hiding-place
,
and
pushing
the
bed
*NL*
back
to
its
original
situation
,
``
let
me
hear
your
story
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dantes
obeyed
,
and
commenced
what
he
called
his
history
,
but
which
*NL*
consisted
only
of
the
account
of
a
voyage
to
India
,
and
two
or
three
*NL*
voyages
to
the
Levant
until
he
arrived
at
the
recital
of
his
last
*NL*
cruise
,
with
the
death
of
Captain
Leclere
,
and
the
receipt
of
a
packet
*NL*
to
be
delivered
by
himself
to
the
grand
marshal
;
his
interview
with
that
*NL*
personage
,
and
his
receiving
,
in
place
of
the
packet
brought
,
a
letter
*NL*
addressed
to
a
Monsieur
Noirtier
--
his
arrival
at
Marseilles
,
and
*NL*
interview
with
his
father
--
his
affection
for
Mercedes
,
and
their
nuptual
*NL*
feast
--
his
arrest
and
subsequent
examination
,
his
temporary
detention
at
*NL*
the
Palais
de
Justice
,
and
his
final
imprisonment
in
the
Chateau
d'If
.
*NL*
From
this
point
everything
was
a
blank
to
Dantes
--
he
knew
nothing
*NL*
more
,
not
even
the
length
of
time
he
had
been
imprisoned
.
His
recital
*NL*
finished
,
the
abbe
reflected
long
and
earnestly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
,
''
said
he
,
at
the
end
of
his
meditations
,
``
a
clever
maxim
,
*NL*
which
bears
upon
what
I
was
saying
to
you
some
little
while
ago
,
and
*NL*
that
is
,
that
unless
wicked
ideas
take
root
in
a
naturally
depraved
*NL*
mind
,
human
nature
,
in
a
right
and
wholesome
state
,
revolts
at
crime
.
*NL*
Still
,
from
an
artificial
civilization
have
originated
wants
,
vices
,
and
*NL*
false
tastes
,
which
occasionally
become
so
powerful
as
to
stifle
*NL*
within
us
all
good
feelings
,
and
ultimately
to
lead
us
into
guilt
and
*NL*
wickedness
.
From
this
view
of
things
,
then
,
comes
the
axiom
that
if
you
*NL*
visit
to
discover
the
author
of
any
bad
action
,
seek
first
to
discover
*NL*
the
person
to
whom
the
perpetration
of
that
bad
action
could
be
in
any
*NL*
way
advantageous
.
Now
,
to
apply
it
in
your
case
,
--
to
whom
could
your
*NL*
disappearance
have
been
serviceable
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
no
one
,
by
heaven
!
I
was
a
very
insignificant
person
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
not
speak
thus
,
for
your
reply
evinces
neither
logic
nor
philosophy
;
*NL*
everything
is
relative
,
my
dear
young
friend
,
from
the
king
who
stands
*NL*
in
the
way
of
his
successor
,
to
the
employee
who
keeps
his
rival
out
of
*NL*
a
place
.
Now
,
in
the
event
of
the
king
's
death
,
his
successor
inherits
a
*NL*
crown
,
--
when
the
employee
dies
,
the
supernumerary
steps
into
his
shoes
,
*NL*
and
receives
his
salary
of
twelve
thousand
livres
.
Well
,
these
twelve
*NL*
thousand
livres
are
his
civil
list
,
and
are
as
essential
to
him
as
the
*NL*
twelve
millions
of
a
king
.
Every
one
,
from
the
highest
to
the
lowest
*NL*
degree
,
has
his
place
on
the
social
ladder
,
and
is
beset
by
stormy
*NL*
passions
and
conflicting
interests
,
as
in
Descartes
'
theory
of
pressure
*NL*
and
impulsion
.
But
these
forces
increase
as
we
go
higher
,
so
that
we
*NL*
have
a
spiral
which
in
defiance
of
reason
rests
upon
the
apex
and
not
on
*NL*
the
base
.
Now
let
us
return
to
your
particular
world
.
You
say
you
were
*NL*
on
the
point
of
being
made
captain
of
the
Pharaon
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
about

become
the
husband
of
a
young

lovely
girl

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
could
any
one
have
had
any
interest
in
preventing
the
*NL*
accomplishment
of
these
two
things
?
But
let
us
first
settle
the
question
*NL*
as
to
its
being
the
interest
of
any
one
to
hinder
you
from
being

Pharaon

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not

possessed
the
right
of
selecting
a
captain
themselves

I
*NL*
feel
convinced
their
choice
would
have
fallen
on
me

There
was
only
one
*NL*

among
the
crew

had
any
feeling
of
ill-will
towards
me

I
had
*NL*
quarelled
with
him
some
time
previously

had
even
challenged
him

fight
me

he
refused

*NL*
``
Now

on

``
Not

Dantes
paused
a
moment
,
then
said
,
``
This
is
it

word
for
word
:
`
The

king

attorney
is
informed
by
a
friend
to
the
throne
and
religion
,
*NL*
that
one
Edmond

mate
on

Pharaon
,
this
day
arrived

from
Smyrna
,
after
having
touched
at
Naples

Porto-Ferrajo
,
has
been
*NL*
intrusted
by
Murat
with
a
packet
for
the
usurper
;
again
,
by
the
usurper
,
*NL*
with
a
letter
for
the
Bonapartist
Club
in
Paris
.
This
proof
of
his
guilt
*NL*
may
be
procured
by
his
immediate
arrest
,
as
the
letter
will
be
found
*NL*
either
about
his
person

at
his
father
's
residence

in
his
cabin

Pharaon

The
abbe
shrugged
his
shoulders
.
``
The
thing
is
*NL*
clear
as
day

''
said
he
;
``
and
you
must
have
had
a
very
confiding
nature

have
suspected

origin

*NL*
``
Do

really

Ah

Backhanded

smiled

``
Disguised

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
very
boldly
written

*NL*
``
Stop

said
the
abbe

taking
up
what
he
called
his

,
*NL*
after
dipping
it
into
the
ink

he
wrote
on

piece

*NL*
with
his
left
hand

the
first
two

three
words
of
the
accusation

*NL*
Dantes
drew
back
,

gazed
on
the
abbe
with
a
sensation
almost
*NL*
amounting
to
terror

*NL*
*NL*
``
How
very
astonishing

cried
he
at
length

Why

Simply

it
was
that
I
underwent
*NL*
no

was

condemned

passed
on
me

*NL*
*NL*
``
That

altogether
a
different

more
serious

responded
the
*NL*
abbe
.

The

frequently

dark

All
we

been

*NL*
``

The

burst
into

laughter

gazed
on
him
in
utter
astonishment

*NL*
*NL*

He

never

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
you
poor
short-sighted
simpleton
,
can
you
not
guess
who
this
*NL*
Noirtier
was
,
whose
very
name
he
was
so
careful
to
keep
concealed
?
*NL*
Noirtier
was
his
father
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Had
a
thunderbolt
fallen
at
the
feet
of
Dantes
,
or
hell
opened
its
*NL*
yawning
gulf
before
him
,
he
could
not
have
been
more
completely
*NL*
transfixed
with
horror
than
he
was
at
the
sound
of
these
unexpected
*NL*
words
.
Starting
up
,
he
clasped
his
hands
around
his
head
as
though
to
*NL*
prevent
his
very
brain
from
bursting
,
and
exclaimed
,
``
His
father
!
his
*NL*
father
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
his
father
,
''
replied
the
abbe
;
``
his
right
name
was
Noirtier
de
*NL*
Villefort
.
''
At
this
instant
a
bright
light
shot
through
the
mind
of
*NL*
Dantes
,
and
cleared
up
all
that
had
been
dark
and
obscure
before
.
*NL*
The
change
that
had
come
over
Villefort
during
the
examination
,
the
*NL*
destruction
of
the
letter
,
the
exacted
promise
,
the
almost
supplicating
*NL*
tones
of
the
magistrate
,
who
seemed
rather
to
implore
mercy
than
to
*NL*
pronounce
punishment
,
--
all
returned
with
a
stunning
force
to
his
memory
.
*NL*
He
cried
out
,
and
staggered
against
the
wall
like
a
drunken
man
,
then
*NL*
he
hurried
to
the
opening
that
led
from
the
abbe
's
cell
to
his
own
,
and
*NL*
said
,
``
I
must
be
alone
,
to
think
over
all
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
regained
his
dungeon
,
he
threw
himself
on
his
bed
,
where
the
*NL*
turnkey
found
him
in
the
evening
visit
,
sitting
with
fixed
gaze
and
*NL*
contracted
features
,
dumb
and
motionless
as
a
statue
.
During
these
hours
*NL*
of
profound
meditation
,
which
to
him
had
seemed
only
minutes
,
he
had
*NL*
formed
a
fearful
resolution
,
and
bound
himself
to
its
fulfilment
by
a
*NL*
solemn
oath
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dantes
was
at
length
roused
from
his
revery
by
the
voice
of
Faria
,
*NL*
who
,
having
also
been
visited
by
his
jailer
,
had
come
to
invite
his
*NL*
fellow-sufferer
to
share
his
supper
.
The
reputation
of
being
out
of
his
*NL*
mind
,
though
harmlessly
and
even
amusingly
so
,
had
procured
for
the
*NL*
abbe
unusual
privileges
.
He
was
supplied
with
bread
of
a
finer
,
whiter
*NL*
quality
than
the
usual
prison
fare
,
and
even
regaled
each
Sunday
with
a
*NL*
small
quantity
of
wine
.
Now
this
was
a
Sunday
,
and
the
abbe
had
come
to
*NL*
ask
his
young
companion
to
share
the
luxuries
with
him
.
Dantes
followed
;
*NL*
his
features
were
no
longer
contracted
,
and
now
wore
their
usual
*NL*
expression
,
but
there
was
that
in
his
whole
appearance
that
bespoke
one
*NL*
who
had
come
to
a
fixed
and
desperate
resolve
.
Faria
bent
on
him
his
*NL*
penetrating
eye
:
``
I
regret
now
,
''
said
he
,
``
having
helped
you
in
your
*NL*
late
inquiries
,
or
having
given
you
the
information
I
did
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
so
?
''
inquired
Dantes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
it
has
instilled
a
new
passion
in
your
heart
--
that
of
*NL*
vengeance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dantes
smiled
.
``
Let
us
talk
of
something
else
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
Again
the
abbe
looked
at
him
,
then
mournfully
shook
his
head
;
but
in
*NL*
accordance
with
Dantes
'
request
,
he
began
to
speak
of
other
matters
.
The
*NL*
elder
prisoner
was
one
of
those
persons
whose
conversation
,
like
that
*NL*
of
all
who
have
experienced
many
trials
,
contained
many
useful
*NL*
and
important
hints
as
well
as
sound
information
;
but
it
was
never
*NL*
egotistical
,
for
the
unfortunate
man
never
alluded
to
his
own
sorrows
.
*NL*
Dantes
listened
with
admiring
attention
to
all
he
said
;
some
of
his
*NL*
remarks
corresponded
with
what
he
already
knew
,
or
applied
to
the
sort
*NL*
of
knowledge
his
nautical
life
had
enabled
him
to
acquire
.
A
part
of
the
*NL*
good
abbe
's
words
,
however
,
were
wholly
incomprehensible
to
him
;
but
,
*NL*
like
the
aurora
which
guides
the
navigator
in
northern
latitudes
,
opened
*NL*
new
vistas
to
the
inquiring
mind
of
the
listener
,
and
gave
fantastic
*NL*
glimpses
of
new
horizons
,
enabling
him
justly
to
estimate
the
delight
an
*NL*
intellectual
mind
would
have
in
following
one
so
richly
gifted
as
Faria
*NL*
along
the
heights
of
truth
,
where
he
was
so
much
at
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
teach
me
a
small
part
of
what
you
know
,
''
said
Dantes
,
``
if
only
*NL*
to
prevent
your
growing
weary
of
me
.
I
can
well
believe
that
so
learned
*NL*
a
person
as
yourself
would
prefer
absolute
solitude
to
being
tormented
*NL*
with
the
company
of
one
as
ignorant
and
uninformed
as
myself
.
If
you
*NL*
will
only
agree
to
my
request
,
I
promise
you
never
to
mention
another
*NL*
word
about
escaping
.
''
The
abbe
smiled
.
``
Alas
,
my
boy
,
''
said
he
,
``
human
*NL*
knowledge
is
confined
within
very
narrow
limits
;
and
when
I
have
*NL*
taught
you
mathematics
,
physics
,
history
,
and
the
three
or
four
modern
*NL*
languages
with
which
I
am
acquainted
,
you
will
know
as
much
as
I
do
*NL*
myself
.
Now
,
it
will
scarcely
require
two
years
for
me
to
communicate
to
*NL*
you
the
stock
of
learning
I
possess
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Two
years
!
''
exclaimed
Dantes
;
``
do
you
really
believe
I
can
acquire
all
*NL*
these
things
in
so
short
a
time
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
their
application
,
certainly
,
but
their
principles
you
may
;
to
*NL*
learn
is
not
to
know
;
there
are
the
learners
and
the
learned
.
Memory
*NL*
makes
the
one
,
philosophy
the
other
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
can
not
one
learn
philosophy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Philosophy
can
not
be
taught
;
it
is
the
application
of
the
sciences
to
*NL*
truth
;
it
is
like
the
golden
cloud
in
which
the
Messiah
went
up
into
*NL*
heaven
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
''
said
Dantes
,
``
What
shall
you
teach
me
first
?
I
am
in
a
*NL*
hurry
to
begin
.
I
want
to
learn
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Everything
,
''
said
the
abbe
.
And
that
very
evening
the
prisoners
*NL*
sketched
a
plan
of
education
,
to
be
entered
upon
the
following
day
.
*NL*
Dantes
possessed
a
prodigious
memory
,
combined
with
an
astonishing
*NL*
quickness
and
readiness
of
conception
;
the
mathematical
turn
of
his
*NL*
mind
rendered
him
apt
at
all
kinds
of
calculation
,
while
his
naturally
*NL*
poetical
feelings
threw
a
light
and
pleasing
veil
over
the
dry
reality
*NL*
of
arithmetical
computation
,
or
the
rigid
severity
of
geometry
.
He
*NL*
already
knew
Italian
,
and
had
also
picked
up
a
little
of
the
Romaic
*NL*
dialect
during
voyages
to
the
East
;
and
by
the
aid
of
these
two
*NL*
languages
he
easily
comprehended
the
construction
of
all
the
others
,
so
*NL*
that
at
the
end
of
six
months
he
began
to
speak
Spanish
,
English
,
and
*NL*
German
.
In
strict
accordance
with
the
promise
made
to
the
abbe
,
Dantes
*NL*
spoke
no
more
of
escape
.
Perhaps
the
delight
his
studies
afforded
him
*NL*
left
no
room
for
such
thoughts
;
perhaps
the
recollection
that
he
had
*NL*
pledged
his
word
-LRB-
on
which
his
sense
of
honor
was
keen
-RRB-
kept
him
from
*NL*
referring
in
any
way
to
the
possibilities
of
flight
.
Days
,
even
months
,
*NL*
passed
by
unheeded
in
one
rapid
and
instructive
course
.
At
the
end
of
*NL*
a
year
Dantes
was
a
new
man
.
Dantes
observed
,
however
,
that
Faria
,
in
*NL*
spite
of
the
relief
his
society
afforded
,
daily
grew
sadder
;
one
thought
*NL*
seemed
incessantly
to
harass
and
distract
his
mind
.
Sometimes
he
would
*NL*
fall
into
long
reveries
,
sigh
heavily
and
involuntarily
,
then
suddenly
*NL*
rise
,
and
,
with
folded
arms
,
begin
pacing
the
confined
space
of
his
*NL*
dungeon
.
One
day
he
stopped
all
at
once
,
and
exclaimed
,
``
Ah
,
if
there
*NL*
were
no
sentinel
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
shall
not
be
one
a
minute
longer
than
you
please
,
''
said
Dantes
,
*NL*
who
had
followed
the
working
of
his
thoughts
as
accurately
as
though
*NL*
his
brain
were
enclosed
in
crystal
so
clear
as
to
display
its
minutest
*NL*
operations
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
already
told
you
,
''
answered
the
abbe
,
``
that
I
loathe
the
idea
of
*NL*
shedding
blood
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
yet
the
murder
,
if
you
choose
to
call
it
so
,
would
be
simply
a
*NL*
measure
of
self-preservation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
matter
!
I
could
never
agree
to
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Still
,
you
have
thought
of
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Incessantly
,
alas
!
''
cried
the
abbe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
have
discovered
a
means
of
regaining
our
freedom
,
have
you
*NL*
not
?
''
asked
Dantes
eagerly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
;
if
it
were
only
possible
to
place
a
deaf
and
blind
sentinel
in
*NL*
the
gallery
beyond
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
shall
be
both
blind
and
deaf
,
''
replied
the
young
man
,
with
an
air
of
*NL*
determination
that
made
his
companion
shudder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
''
cried
the
abbe
;
``
impossible
!
''
Dantes
endeavored
to
renew
the
*NL*
subject
;
the
abbe
shook
his
head
in
token
of
disapproval
,
and
refused
to
*NL*
make
any
further
response
.
Three
months
passed
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
strong
?
''
the
abbe
asked
one
day
of
Dantes
.
The
young
man
,
in
*NL*
reply
,
took
up
the
chisel
,
bent
it
into
the
form
of
a
horseshoe
,
and
*NL*
then
as
readily
straightened
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
will
you
engage
not
to
do
any
harm
to
the
sentry
,
except
as
a
last
*NL*
resort
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
promise
on
my
honor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
''
said
the
abbe
,
``
we
may
hope
to
put
our
design
into
execution
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
long
shall
we
be
in
accomplishing
the
necessary
work
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
least
a
year
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
shall
we
begin
at
once
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
once
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
lost
a
year
to
no
purpose
!
''
cried
Dantes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
consider
the
last
twelve
months
to
have
been
wasted
?
''
asked
the
*NL*
abbe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Forgive
me
!
''
cried
Edmond
,
blushing
deeply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tut
,
tut
!
''
answered
the
abbe
,
``
man
is
but
man
after
all
,
and
you
are
*NL*
about
the
best
specimen
of
the
genus
I
have
ever
known
.
Come
,
let
me
*NL*
show
you
my
plan
.
''
The
abbe
then
showed
Dantes
the
sketch
he
had
made
*NL*
for
their
escape
.
It
consisted
of
a
plan
of
his
own
cell
and
that
of
*NL*
Dantes
,
with
the
passage
which
united
them
.
In
this
passage
he
proposed
*NL*
to
drive
a
level
as
they
do
in
mines
;
this
level
would
bring
the
two
*NL*
prisoners
immediately
beneath
the
gallery
where
the
sentry
kept
watch
;
*NL*
once
there
,
a
large
excavation
would
be
made
,
and
one
of
the
flag-stones
*NL*
with
which
the
gallery
was
paved
be
so
completely
loosened
that
at
the
*NL*
desired
moment
it
would
give
way
beneath
the
feet
of
the
soldier
,
who
,
*NL*
stunned
by
his
fall
,
would
be
immediately
bound
and
gagged
by
Dantes
*NL*
before
he
had
power
to
offer
any
resistance
.
The
prisoners
were
then
to
*NL*
make
their
way
through
one
of
the
gallery
windows
,
and
to
let
themselves
*NL*
down
from
the
outer
walls
by
means
of
the
abbe
's
ladder
of
cords
.
*NL*
Dantes
'
eyes
sparkled
with
joy
,
and
he
rubbed
his
hands
with
delight
at
*NL*
the
idea
of
a
plan
so
simple
,
yet
apparently
so
certain
to
succeed
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
very
day
the
miners
began
their
labors
,
with
a
vigor
and
alacrity
*NL*
proportionate
to
their
long
rest
from
fatigue
and
their
hopes
of
*NL*
ultimate
success
.
Nothing
interrupted
the
progress
of
the
work
*NL*
except
the
necessity
that
each
was
under
of
returning
to
his
cell
in
*NL*
anticipation
of
the
turnkey
's
visits
.
They
had
learned
to
distinguish
*NL*
the
almost
imperceptible
sound
of
his
footsteps
as
he
descended
towards
*NL*
their
dungeons
,
and
happily
,
never
failed
of
being
prepared
for
his
*NL*
coming
.
The
fresh
earth
excavated
during
their
present
work
,
and
which
*NL*
would
have
entirely
blocked
up
the
old
passage
,
was
thrown
,
by
degrees
*NL*
and
with
the
utmost
precaution
,
out
of
the
window
in
either
Faria
's
*NL*
or
Dantes
'
cell
,
the
rubbish
being
first
pulverized
so
finely
that
the
*NL*
night
wind
carried
it
far
away
without
permitting
the
smallest
trace
to
*NL*
remain
.
More
than
a
year
had
been
consumed
in
this
undertaking
,
the
only
*NL*
tools
for
which
had
been
a
chisel
,
a
knife
,
and
a
wooden
lever
;
Faria
*NL*
still
continuing
to
instruct
Dantes
by
conversing
with
him
,
sometimes
*NL*
in
one
language
,
sometimes
in
another
;
at
others
,
relating
to
him
the
*NL*
history
of
nations
and
great
men
who
from
time
to
time
have
risen
to
*NL*
fame
and
trodden
the
path
of
glory
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
abbe
was
a
man
of
the
world
,
and
had
,
moreover
,
mixed
in
the
first
*NL*
society
of
the
day
;
he
wore
an
air
of
melancholy
dignity
which
Dantes
,
*NL*
thanks
to
the
imitative
powers
bestowed
on
him
by
nature
,
easily
*NL*
acquired
,
as
well
as
that
outward
polish
and
politeness
he
had
before
*NL*
been
wanting
in
,
and
which
is
seldom
possessed
except
by
those
who
*NL*
have
been
placed
in
constant
intercourse
with
persons
of
high
birth
and
*NL*
breeding
.
At
the
end
of
fifteen
months
the
level
was
finished
,
and
the
*NL*
excavation
completed
beneath
the
gallery
,
and
the
two
workmen
could
*NL*
distinctly
hear
the
measured
tread
of
the
sentinel
as
he
paced
to
and
*NL*
fro
over
their
heads
.
*NL*
*NL*
Compelled
,
as
they
were
,
to
await
a
night
sufficiently
dark
to
favor
*NL*
their
flight
,
they
were
obliged
to
defer
their
final
attempt
till
that
*NL*
auspicious
moment
should
arrive
;
their
greatest
dread
now
was
lest
the
*NL*
stone
through
which
the
sentry
was
doomed
to
fall
should
give
way
before
*NL*
its
right
time
,
and
this
they
had
in
some
measure
provided
against
by
*NL*
propping
it
up
with
a
small
beam
which
they
had
discovered
in
the
*NL*
walls
through
which
they
had
worked
their
way
.
Dantes
was
occupied
in
*NL*
arranging
this
piece
of
wood
when
he
heard
Faria
,
who
had
remained
*NL*
in
Edmond
's
cell
for
the
purpose
of
cutting
a
peg
to
secure
their
*NL*
rope-ladder
,
call
to
him
in
a
tone
indicative
of
great
suffering
.
Dantes
*NL*
hastened
to
his
dungeon
,
where
he
found
him
standing
in
the
middle
of
*NL*
the
room
,
pale
as
death
,
his
forehead
streaming
with
perspiration
,
and
*NL*
his
hands
clinched
tightly
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gracious
heavens
!
''
exclaimed
Dantes
,
``
what
is
the
matter
?
what
has
*NL*
happened
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quick
!
quick
!
''
returned
the
abbe
,
``
listen
to
what
I
have
to
say
.
''
*NL*
Dantes
looked
in
fear
and
wonder
at
the
livid
countenance
of
Faria
,
*NL*
whose
eyes
,
already
dull
and
sunken
,
were
surrounded
by
purple
circles
,
*NL*
while
his
lips
were
white
as
those
of
a
corpse
,
and
his
very
hair
seemed
*NL*
to
stand
on
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
,
I
beseech
you
,
what
ails
you
?
''
cried
Dantes
,
letting
his
*NL*
chisel
fall
to
the
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas
,
''
faltered
out
the
abbe
,
``
all
is
over
with
me
.
I
am
seized
with
a
*NL*
terrible
,
perhaps
mortal
illness
;
I
can
feel
that
the
paroxysm
is
*NL*
fast
approaching
.
I
had
a
similar
attack
the
year
previous
to
my
*NL*
imprisonment
.
This
malady
admits
but
of
one
remedy
;
I
will
tell
you
what
*NL*
that
is
.
Go
into
my
cell
as
quickly
as
you
can
;
draw
out
one
of
the
feet
*NL*
that
support
the
bed
;
you
will
find
it
has
been
hollowed
out
for
the
*NL*
purpose
of
containing
a
small
phial
you
will
see
there
half-filled
with
*NL*
a
red-looking
fluid
.
Bring
it
to
me
--
or
rather
--
no
,
no
!
--
I
may
be
found
*NL*
here
,
therefore
help
me
back
to
my
room
while
I
have
the
strength
to
*NL*
drag
myself
along
.
Who
knows
what
may
happen
,
or
how
long
the
attack
may
*NL*
last
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
spite
of
the
magnitude
of
the
misfortune
which
thus
suddenly
*NL*
frustrated
his
hopes
,
Dantes
did
not
lose
his
presence
of
mind
,
but
*NL*
descended
into
the
passage
,
dragging
his
unfortunate
companion
with
him
;
*NL*
then
,
half-carrying
,
half-supporting
him
,
he
managed
to
reach
the
abbe
's
*NL*
chamber
,
when
he
immediately
laid
the
sufferer
on
his
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thanks
,
''
said
the
poor
abbe
,
shivering
as
though
his
veins
were
filled
*NL*
with
ice
.
``
I
am
about
to
be
seized
with
a
fit
of
catalepsy
;
when
it
*NL*
comes
to
its
height
I
shall
probably
lie
still
and
motionless
as
though
*NL*
dead
,
uttering
neither
sigh
nor
groan
.
On
the
other
hand
,
the
symptoms
*NL*
may
be
much
more
violent
,
and
cause
me
to
fall
into
fearful
convulsions
,
*NL*
foam
at
the
mouth
,
and
cry
out
loudly
.
Take
care
my
cries
are
not
heard
,
*NL*
for
if
they
are
it
is
more
than
probable
I
should
be
removed
to
another
*NL*
part
of
the
prison
,
and
we
be
separated
forever
.
When
I
become
quite
*NL*
motionless
,
cold
,
and
rigid
as
a
corpse
,
then
,
and
not
before
,
--
be
*NL*
careful
about
this
,
--
force
open
my
teeth
with
the
knife
,
pour
from
eight
*NL*
to
ten
drops
of
the
liquor
contained
in
the
phial
down
my
throat
,
and
I
*NL*
may
perhaps
revive
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
!
''
exclaimed
Dantes
in
grief-stricken
tones
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Help
!
help
!
''
cried
the
abbe
,
``
I
--
I
--
die
--
I
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
So
sudden
and
violent
was
the
fit
that
the
unfortunate
prisoner
was
*NL*
unable
to
complete
the
sentence
;
a
violent
convulsion
shook
his
whole
*NL*
frame
,
his
eyes
started
from
their
sockets
,
his
mouth
was
drawn
on
one
*NL*
side
,
his
cheeks
became
purple
,
he
struggled
,
foamed
,
dashed
himself
*NL*
about
,
and
uttered
the
most
dreadful
cries
,
which
,
however
,
Dantes
*NL*
prevented
from
being
heard
by
covering
his
head
with
the
blanket
.
The
*NL*
fit
lasted
two
hours
;
then
,
more
helpless
than
an
infant
,
and
colder
and
*NL*
paler
than
marble
,
more
crushed
and
broken
than
a
reed
trampled
under
*NL*
foot
,
he
fell
back
,
doubled
up
in
one
last
convulsion
,
and
became
as
*NL*
rigid
as
a
corpse
.
*NL*
*NL*
Edmond
waited
till
life
seemed
extinct
in
the
body
of
his
friend
,
then
,
*NL*
taking
up
the
knife
,
he
with
difficulty
forced
open
the
closely
*NL*
fixed
jaws
,
carefully
administered
the
appointed
number
of
drops
,
and
*NL*
anxiously
awaited
the
result
.
An
hour
passed
away
and
the
old
man
gave
*NL*
no
sign
of
returning
animation
.
Dantes
began
to
fear
he
had
delayed
too
*NL*
long
ere
he
administered
the
remedy
,
and
,
thrusting
his
hands
into
his
*NL*
hair
,
continued
gazing
on
the
lifeless
features
of
his
friend
.
At
length
*NL*
a
slight
color
tinged
the
livid
cheeks
,
consciousness
returned
to
the
*NL*
dull
,
open
eyeballs
,
a
faint
sigh
issued
from
the
lips
,
and
the
sufferer
*NL*
made
a
feeble
effort
to
move
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
saved
!
he
is
saved
!
''
cried
Dantes
in
a
paroxysm
of
delight
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sick
man
was
not
yet
able
to
speak
,
but
he
pointed
with
evident
*NL*
anxiety
towards
the
door
.
Dantes
listened
,
and
plainly
distinguished
the
*NL*
approaching
steps
of
the
jailer
.
It
was
therefore
near
seven
o'clock
;
*NL*
but
Edmond
's
anxiety
had
put
all
thoughts
of
time
out
of
his
head
.
The
*NL*
young
man
sprang
to
the
entrance
,
darted
through
it
,
carefully
drawing
*NL*
the
stone
over
the
opening
,
and
hurried
to
his
cell
.
He
had
scarcely
*NL*
done
so
before
the
door
opened
,
and
the
jailer
saw
the
prisoner
seated
*NL*
as
usual
on
the
side
of
his
bed
.
Almost
before
the
key
had
turned
in
the
*NL*
lock
,
and
before
the
departing
steps
of
the
jailer
had
died
away
in
*NL*
the
long
corridor
he
had
to
traverse
,
Dantes
,
whose
restless
anxiety
*NL*
concerning
his
friend
left
him
no
desire
to
touch
the
food
brought
him
,
*NL*
hurried
back
to
the
abbe
's
chamber
,
and
raising
the
stone
by
pressing
*NL*
his
head
against
it
,
was
soon
beside
the
sick
man
's
couch
.
Faria
had
*NL*
now
fully
regained
his
consciousness
,
but
he
still
lay
helpless
and
*NL*
exhausted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
not
expect
to
see
you
again
,
''
said
he
feebly
,
to
Dantes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
why
not
?
''
asked
the
young
man
.
``
Did
you
fancy
yourself
dying
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
had
no
such
idea
;
but
,
knowing
that
all
was
ready
for
flight
,
I
*NL*
thought
you
might
have
made
your
escape
.
''
The
deep
glow
of
indignation
*NL*
suffused
the
cheeks
of
Dantes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Without
you
?
Did
you
really
think
me
capable
of
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
least
,
''
said
the
abbe
,
``
I
now
see
how
wrong
such
an
opinion
would
*NL*
have
been
.
Alas
,
alas
!
I
am
fearfully
exhausted
and
debilitated
by
this
*NL*
attack
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
of
good
cheer
,
''
replied
Dantes
;
``
your
strength
will
return
.
''
And
*NL*
as
he
spoke
he
seated
himself
near
the
bed
beside
Faria
,
and
took
his
*NL*
hands
.
The
abbe
shook
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
last
attack
I
had
,
''
said
he
,
``
lasted
but
half
an
hour
,
and
after
it
*NL*
I
was
hungry
,
and
got
up
without
help
;
now
I
can
move
neither
my
right
*NL*
arm
nor
leg
,
and
my
head
seems
uncomfortable
,
which
shows
that
there
*NL*
has
been
a
suffusion
of
blood
on
the
brain
.
The
third
attack
will
either
*NL*
carry
me
off
,
or
leave
me
paralyzed
for
life
.
''
*NL*

``
No

your

you
should
have
another

will
find
you
at

we

only
with

*NL*
*NL*
``
My
good
Edmond

answered
the
abbe
,
``
be
not
deceived

The
attack
which
*NL*
has
just
passed
away

condemns
me
forever
to
the
walls
of
a
prison

None
*NL*
can
fly
from
a
dungeon
who
can
not
walk

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

two

your

Everything
is
in

we

select

we

As

go

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
never
swim
again

''
replied
Faria
.
``
This
arm
is
paralyzed
;
not
*NL*
for
a

but
forever

Lift
it
,
and
judge

I
am
mistaken

''
The
*NL*
young
man
raised
the
arm
,
which
fell
back
by
its
own
weight
,
perfectly
*NL*
inanimate
and
helpless
.
A
sigh
escaped
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
convinced
now
,
Edmond

are
you
not
?
''
asked
the
abbe
.
``
Depend
*NL*
upon
it
,
I
know
what
I
say
.
Since
the
first
attack
I
experienced
of
this
*NL*
malady
,
I
have
continually
reflected
on
it
.
Indeed
,
I
expected
it
,
for
*NL*
it
is
a
family
inheritance
;
both
my
father
and
grandfather
died
of
it
*NL*
in
a
third
attack
.
The
physician
who
prepared
for
me
the
remedy
I
have
*NL*
twice
successfully
taken
,
was
no
other
than
the
celebrated
Cabanis
,
and
*NL*
he
predicted
a
similar
end
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
physician
may
be
mistaken
!
''
exclaimed
Dantes
.
``
And
as
for
your
poor
*NL*
arm
,
what
difference
will
that
make
?
I
can
take
you
on
my
shoulders
,
and
*NL*
swim
for
both
of
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
son
,
''
said
the
abbe
,
``
you
,
who
are
a
sailor
and
a
swimmer

must
know
*NL*
as
well
as
I
do
that
a
man
so
loaded
would
sink
before
he
had
done
fifty
*NL*
strokes
.
Cease
,
then
,
to
allow
yourself
to
be
duped
by
vain
hopes
,
that
*NL*
even
your
own
excellent
heart
refuses
to
believe
in

Here
I
shall

remain
till
the
hour

my
deliverance
arrives

and
that
,
in

not

fly

*NL*
*NL*

It

Dantes

Then

Then
,
rising

*NL*
extending
his
hand
with
an
air
of
solemnity
over
the
old
man

head
,
he
*NL*
slowly
added
,
``
By

blood
of
Christ
I
swear
never
to
leave
you

you
live

*NL*
*NL*
Faria
gazed
fondly
on
his
noble-minded
,
single-hearted
,
high-principled
*NL*
young
friend
,
and
read
in
his
countenance
ample
confirmation
of
the
*NL*
sincerity
of
his
devotion
and
the
loyalty
of
his
purpose
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thanks
,
''
murmured
the
invalid
,
extending
one
hand
.
``
I
accept

You
may
*NL*
one
of
these
days
reap
the
reward
of
your
disinterested
devotion

But
*NL*
as
I
can
not
,
and
you
will
not
,
quit
this
place
,
it
becomes
necessary
*NL*
to
fill
up
the
excavation
beneath
the
soldier
's
gallery
;
he
might
,
by
*NL*
chance
,
hear
the
hollow
sound
of
his
footsteps
,
and
call
the
attention
*NL*
of
his
officer
to
the
circumstance
.
That
would
bring
about
a
discovery
*NL*
which
would
inevitably
lead
to
our
being
separated
.
Go
,
then
,
and
set
*NL*
about
this
work
,
in
which
,
unhappily
,
I
can
offer
you
no
assistance
;
*NL*
keep
at
it
all
night
,
if
necessary
,
and
do
not
return
here
to-morrow
*NL*
till
after
the
jailer
his
visited
me

I
shall
have
something
of
the
*NL*
greatest
importance
to
communicate
to
you

''
*NL*
*NL*
Dantes
took
the
hand
of
the
abbe
in
his
,
and
affectionately
pressed
*NL*
it
.
Faria
smiled
encouragingly
on
him
,
and
the
young
man
retired
to
his
*NL*
task
,
in
the
spirit
of
obedience
and
respect
which
he
had
sworn
to
show
*NL*
towards
his

The
Treasure
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Dantes
returned
next
morning
to
the
chamber
of
his
companion
in
*NL*
captivity
,
he
found
Faria
seated
and
looking
composed
.
In
the
ray
of
*NL*
light
which
entered
by
the
narrow
window
of
his
cell
,
he
held
open
in
*NL*
his
left
hand
,
of
which
alone
,
it
will
be
recollected
,
he
retained
the
*NL*
use
,
a
sheet
of
paper
,
which
,
from
being
constantly
rolled
into
a
small
*NL*
compass
,
had
the
form
of
a
cylinder
,
and
was
not
easily
kept
open
.
He
*NL*
did
not
speak
,
but
showed
the
paper
to
Dantes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
that
?
''
he
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
at
it
,
''
said
the
abbe
with
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
looked
at
it
with
all
possible
attention
,
''
said
Dantes
,
``
and
I
*NL*
only
see
a
half-burnt
paper
,
on
which
are
traces
of
Gothic
characters
*NL*
inscribed
with
a
peculiar
kind
of
ink
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
paper
,
my
friend
,
''
said
Faria
,
``
I
may
now
avow
to
you
,
since
I
*NL*
have
the
proof
of
your
fidelity
--
this
paper
is
my
treasure
,
of
which
,
*NL*
from
this
day
forth
,
one-half
belongs
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
sweat
started
forth
on
Dantes
brow
.
Until
this
day
and
for
how
*NL*
long
a
time
!
--
he
had
refrained
from
talking
of
the
treasure
,
which
had
*NL*
brought
upon
the
abbe
the
accusation
of
madness
.
With
his
instinctive
*NL*
delicacy
Edmond
had
preferred
avoiding
any
touch
on
this
painful
chord
,
*NL*
and
Faria
had
been
equally
silent
.
He
had
taken
the
silence
of
the
old
*NL*
man
for
a
return
to
reason
;
and
now
these
few
words
uttered
by
Faria
,
*NL*
after
so
painful
a
crisis
,
seemed
to
indicate
a
serious
relapse
into
*NL*
mental
alienation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
treasure
?
''
stammered
Dantes
.
Faria
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
he
.
``
You
have
,
indeed
,
a
noble
nature
,
Edmond
,
and
I
see
*NL*
by
your
paleness
and
agitation
what
is
passing
in
your
heart
at
this
*NL*
moment
.
No
,
be
assured
,
I
am
not
mad
.
This
treasure
exists
,
Dantes
,
and
*NL*
if
I
have
not
been
allowed
to
possess
it
,
you
will
.
Yes
--
you
.
No
one
*NL*
would
listen
or
believe
me
,
because
everyone
thought
me
mad
;
but
you
,
*NL*
who
must
know
that
I
am
not
,
listen
to
me
,
and
believe
me
so
afterwards
*NL*
if
you
will
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas
,
''
murmured
Edmond
to
himself
,
``
this
is
a
terrible
relapse
!
There
*NL*
was
only
this
blow
wanting
.
''
Then
he
said
aloud
,
``
My
dear
friend
,
your
*NL*
attack
has
,
perhaps
,
fatigued
you
;
had
you
not
better
repose
awhile
?
*NL*
To-morrow
,
if
you
will
,
I
will
hear
your
narrative
;
but
to-day
I
wish
*NL*
to
nurse
you
carefully
.
Besides
,
''
he
said
,
``
a
treasure
is
not
a
thing
we
*NL*
need
hurry
about
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
contrary
,
it
is
a
matter
of
the
utmost
importance
,
Edmond
!
''
*NL*
replied
the
old
man
.
``
Who
knows
if
to-morrow
,
or
the
next
day
after
,
*NL*
the
third
attack
may
not
come
on
?
and
then
must
not
all
be
over
?
Yes
,
*NL*
indeed
,
I
have
often
thought
with
a
bitter
joy
that
these
riches
,
which
*NL*
would
make
the
wealth
of
a
dozen
families
,
will
be
forever
lost
to
those
*NL*
men
who
persecute
me
.
This
idea
was
one
of
vengeance
to
me
,
and
I
tasted
*NL*
it
slowly
in
the
night
of
my
dungeon
and
the
despair
of
my
captivity
.
*NL*
But
now
I
have
forgiven
the
world
for
the
love
of
you
;
now
that
I
see
*NL*
you
,
young
and
with
a
promising
future
,
--
now
that
I
think
of
all
that
*NL*
may
result
to
you
in
the
good
fortune
of
such
a
disclosure
,
I
shudder
*NL*
at
any
delay
,
and
tremble
lest
I
should
not
assure
to
one
as
worthy
as
*NL*
yourself
the
possession
of
so
vast
an
amount
of
hidden
wealth
.
''
Edmond
*NL*
turned
away
his
head
with
a
sigh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
persist
in
your
incredulity
,
Edmond
,
''
continued
Faria
.
``
My
words
*NL*
have
not
convinced
you
.
I
see
you
require
proofs
.
Well
,
then
,
read
this
*NL*
paper
,
which
I
have
never
shown
to
any
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To-morrow
,
my
dear
friend
,
''
said
Edmond
,
desirous
of
not
yielding
to
*NL*
the
old
man
's
madness
.
``
I
thought
it
was
understood
that
we
should
not
*NL*
talk
of
that
until
to-morrow

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
we
will
not
talk
of
it

but
read
this
paper
*NL*
to-day

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
not
irritate
him
,
''
thought
Edmond
,
and
taking
the
paper
,
*NL*
of
which
half
was
wanting
,
--
having
been
burnt
,
no
doubt
,
by
some
*NL*
accident
,
--
he
read
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

said
Faria
,
when
the
young
man
had
finished
reading
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

''
replied
Dantes
,
``
I
see
nothing
but
broken
lines

unconnected

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

who
have
grown
pale
over

reconstructed

completed

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
do

discovered
the
hidden

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sure
I
have

and
you
shall
judge
for
yourself
;
but
first
listen
to
*NL*
the
history
of
this
paper
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Silence
!
''
exclaimed
Dantes
.
``
Steps
approach
--
I
go

adieu
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Dantes
,
happy
to
escape
the
history
and
explanation
which
would
be
*NL*
sure
to
confirm
his
belief
in
his
friend
's
mental
instability
,
glided
*NL*
like
a
snake
along
the
narrow
passage
;
while
Faria
,
restored
by
his
*NL*
alarm
to
a
certain
amount
of
activity
,
pushed
the
stone
into
place
with
*NL*
his
foot
,
and
covered
it
with
a
mat
in
order
the
more
effectually
to
*NL*
avoid
discovery
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
governor
,
who
,
hearing
of
Faria
's
illness
from
the
jailer
,
*NL*
had
come
in
person
to
see
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Faria
sat
up
to
receive
him
,
avoiding
all
gestures
in
order
that
he
*NL*
might
conceal
from
the
governor
the
paralysis
that
had
already
half
*NL*
stricken
him
with
death
.
His
fear
was
lest
the
governor
,
touched
*NL*
with
pity
,
might
order
him
to
be
removed
to
better
quarters
,
and
thus
*NL*
separate
him
from
his
young
companion
.
But
fortunately
this
was
not
the
*NL*
case
,
and
the
governor
left
him
,
convinced
that
the
poor
madman
,
for
*NL*
whom
in
his
heart
he
felt
a
kind
of
affection
,
was
only
troubled
with
a
*NL*
slight
indisposition
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
this
time
,
Edmond
,
seated
on
his
bed
with
his
head
in
his
hands
,
*NL*
tried
to
collect
his
scattered
thoughts
.
Faria
,
since
their
first
*NL*
acquaintance
,
had
been
on
all
points
so
rational
and
logical
,
so
*NL*
wonderfully
sagacious
,
in
fact
,
that
he
could
not
understand
how
so
much
*NL*
wisdom
on
all
points
could
be
allied
with
madness
.
Was
Faria
deceived
as
*NL*
to
his
treasure
,
or
was
all
the
world
deceived
as
to
Faria
?
*NL*
*NL*
Dantes
remained
in
his
cell
all
day
,
not
daring
to
return
to
his
friend
,
*NL*
thinking
thus
to
defer
the
moment
when
he
should
be
convinced
,
once
for
*NL*
all
,
that
the
abbe
was
mad
--
such
a
conviction
would
be
so
terrible
!
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
towards
the
evening
after
the
hour
for
the
customary
visit
had
gone
*NL*
by
,
Faria
,
not
seeing
the
young
man
appear
,
tried
to
move
and
get
over
*NL*
the
distance
which
separated
them
.
Edmond
shuddered
when
he
heard
the
*NL*
painful
efforts
which
the
old
man
made
to
drag
himself
along
;
his
*NL*
leg
was
inert
,
and
he
could
no
longer
make
use
of
one
arm
.
Edmond
was
*NL*
obliged
to
assist
him
,
for
otherwise
he
would
not
have
been
able
to
*NL*
enter
by
the
small
aperture
which
led
to
Dantes
'
chamber
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
I
am
,
pursuing
you
remorselessly
,
''
he
said
with
a
benignant
smile
.
*NL*
``
You
thought
to
escape
my
munificence
,
but
it
is
in
vain
.
Listen
to
me

''
*NL*
*NL*
Edmond
saw
there
was
no
escape
,
and
placing
the
old
man
on
his
bed
,
he
*NL*
seated
himself
on
the
stool
beside
him
.
*NL*

said
the
abbe

``
that
I
was
the
secretary
and
intimate
friend
*NL*
of
Cardinal
Spada
,
the
last
of
the
princes
of
that
name
.
I
owe
to
this
*NL*
worthy
lord
all
the
happiness
I
ever
knew
.
He
was
not
rich
,
although
the
*NL*
wealth
of
his
family
had
passed
into
a
proverb
,
and
I
heard
the
phrase
*NL*
very
often
,
`
As
rich
as
a
Spada
.
'
But
he
,
like
public
rumor
,
lived
on
*NL*
this
reputation
for
wealth
;
his
palace
was
my
paradise
.
I
was
tutor
to
*NL*
his
nephews
,
who
are
dead
;
and
when
he
was
alone
in
the
world
,
I
tried
*NL*
by
absolute
devotion
to
his
will
,
to
make
up
to
him
all
he
had
done
for
*NL*
me
during
ten
years
of
unremitting
kindness
.
The
cardinal
's
house
had
*NL*
no
secrets
for
me
.
I
had
often
seen
my
noble
patron
annotating
ancient
*NL*
volumes
,
and
eagerly
searching
amongst
dusty
family
manuscripts
.
One
day
*NL*
when
I
was
reproaching
him
for
his
unavailing
searches
,
and
deploring
*NL*
the
prostration
of
mind
that
followed
them
,
he
looked
at
me
,
and
,
*NL*
smiling
bitterly
,
opened
a
volume
relating
to
the
History
of
the
City
of
*NL*
Rome
.
There
,
in
the
twentieth
chapter
of
the
Life
of
Pope
Alexander
VI.
,
*NL*
were
the
following
lines
,
which
I
can
never
forget
:
--

''
`
The
great
wars
of
Romagna
had
ended
;
Caesar
Borgia
,
who
had
completed
*NL*
his
conquest
,
had
need
of
money
to
purchase
all
Italy
.
The
pope
had
also
*NL*
need
of
money
to
bring
matters
to
an
end
with
Louis
XII
.
King
of
France
,
*NL*
who
was
formidable
still
in
spite
of
his
recent
reverses
;
and
it
was
*NL*
necessary
,
therefore
,
to
have
recourse
to
some
profitable
scheme
,
*NL*
which
was
a
matter
of
great
difficulty
in
the
impoverished
condition
*NL*
of
exhausted
Italy
.
His
holiness
had
an
idea
.
He
determined
to
make
two
*NL*
cardinals
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
choosing
two
of
the
greatest
personages
of
Rome
,
especially
rich
*NL*
men
--
this
was
the
return
the
holy
father
looked
for
.
In
the
first
place
,
*NL*
he
could
sell
the
great
appointments
and
splendid
offices
which
the
*NL*
cardinals
already
held
;
and
then
he
had
the
two
hats
to
sell
besides
.
*NL*
There
was
a
third
point
in
view
,
which
will
appear
hereafter
.
The
*NL*
pope
and
Caesar
Borgia
first
found
the
two
future
cardinals
;
they
were
*NL*
Giovanni
Rospigliosi
,
who
held
four
of
the
highest
dignities
of
the
*NL*
Holy
See
,
and
Caesar
Spada
,
one
of
the
noblest
and
richest
of
the
Roman
*NL*
nobility
;
both
felt
the
high
honor
of
such
a
favor
from
the
pope
.
*NL*
They
were
ambitious
,
and
Caesar
Borgia
soon
found
purchasers
for
their
*NL*
appointments
.
The
result
was
,
that
Rospigliosi
and
Spada
paid
for
being
*NL*
cardinals
,
and
eight
other
persons
paid
for
the
offices
the
cardinals
*NL*
held
before
their
elevation
,
and
thus
eight
hundred
thousand
crowns
*NL*
entered
into
the
coffers
of
the
speculators
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
time
now
to
proceed
to
the
last
part
of
the
speculation
.
The
pope
*NL*
heaped
attentions
upon
Rospigliosi
and
Spada
,
conferred
upon
them
the
*NL*
insignia
of
the
cardinalate
,
and
induced
them
to
arrange
their
affairs
*NL*
and
take
up
their
residence
at
Rome
.
Then
the
pope
and
Caesar
Borgia
*NL*
invited
the
two
cardinals
to
dinner
.
This
was
a
matter
of
dispute
*NL*
between
the
holy
father
and
his
son
.
Caesar
thought
they
could
make
use
*NL*
of
one
of
the
means
which
he
always
had
ready
for
his
friends
,
that
is
*NL*
to
say
,
in
the
first
place
,
the
famous
key
which
was
given
to
certain
*NL*
persons
with
the
request
that
they
go
and
open
a
designated
cupboard
.
*NL*
This
key
was
furnished
with
a
small
iron
point
,
--
a
negligence
on
the
*NL*
part
of
the
locksmith
.
When
this
was
pressed
to
effect
the
opening
of
*NL*
the
cupboard
,
of
which
the
lock
was
difficult
,
the
person
was
pricked
*NL*
by
this
small
point
,
and
died
next
day
.
Then
there
was
the
ring
with
the
*NL*
lion
's
head
,
which
Caesar
wore
when
he
wanted
to
greet
his
friends
with
*NL*
a
clasp
of
the
hand
.
The
lion
bit
the
hand
thus
favored
,
and
at
the
*NL*
end
of
twenty-four
hours
,
the
bite
was
mortal
.
Caesar
proposed
to
his
*NL*
father
,
that
they
should
either
ask
the
cardinals
to
open
the
cupboard
,
*NL*
or
shake
hands
with
them
;
but
Alexander
VI.
,
replied
:
`
Now
as
to
the
*NL*
worthy
cardinals
,
Spada
and
Rospigliosi
,
let
us
ask
both
of
them
to
*NL*
dinner
,
something
tells
me
that
we
shall
get
that
money
back
.
Besides
,
*NL*
you
forget
,
Caesar
,
an
indigestion
declares
itself
immediately
,
while
*NL*
a
prick
or
a
bite
occasions
a
delay
of
a
day
or
two
.
'
Caesar
gave
*NL*
way
before
such
cogent
reasoning
,
and
the
cardinals
were
consequently
*NL*
invited
to
dinner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
table
was
laid
in
a
vineyard
belonging
to
the
pope
,
near
San
*NL*
Pierdarena
,
a
charming
retreat
which
the
cardinals
knew
very
well
by
*NL*
report
.
Rospigliosi
,
quite
set
up
with
his
new
dignities
,
went
with
a
*NL*
good
appetite
and
his
most
ingratiating
manner
.
Spada
,
a
prudent
man
,
*NL*
and
greatly
attached
to
his
only
nephew
,
a
young
captain
of
the
highest
*NL*
promise
,
took
paper
and
pen
,
and
made
his
will
.
He
then
sent
word
to
his
*NL*
nephew
to
wait
for
him
near
the
vineyard
;
but
it
appeared
the
servant
*NL*
did
not
find
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Spada
knew
what
these
invitations
meant
;
since
Christianity
,
so
*NL*
eminently
civilizing
,
had
made
progress
in
Rome
,
it
was
no
longer
a
*NL*
centurion
who
came
from
the
tyrant
with
a
message
,
`
Caesar
wills
that
*NL*
you
die
.
'
but
it
was
a
legate
a
latere
,
who
came
with
a
smile
on
his
*NL*
lips
to
say
from
the
pope
,
`
His
holiness
requests
you
to
dine
with
him
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
Spada
set
out
about
two
o'clock
to
San
Pierdarena
.
The
pope
awaited
*NL*
him
.
The
first
sight
that
attracted
the
eyes
of
Spada
was
that
of
*NL*
his
nephew
,
in
full
costume
,
and
Caesar
Borgia
paying
him
most
marked
*NL*
attentions
.
Spada
turned
pale
,
as
Caesar
looked
at
him
with
an
ironical
*NL*
air
,
which
proved
that
he
had
anticipated
all
,
and
that
the
snare
was
*NL*
well
spread
.
They
began
dinner
and
Spada
was
only
able
to
inquire
of
his
*NL*
nephew
if
he
had
received
his
message
.
The
nephew
replied
no
;
perfectly
*NL*
comprehending
the
meaning
of
the
question
.
It
was
too
late
,
for
he
had
*NL*
already
drunk
a
glass
of
excellent
wine
,
placed
for
him
expressly
by
the
*NL*
pope
's
butler
.
Spada
at
the
same
moment
saw
another
bottle
approach
him
,
*NL*
which
he
was
pressed
to
taste
.
An
hour
afterwards
a
physician
declared
*NL*
they
were
both
poisoned
through
eating
mushrooms
.
Spada
died
on
the
*NL*
threshold
of
the
vineyard
;
the
nephew
expired
at
his
own
door
,
making
*NL*
signs
which
his
wife
could
not
comprehend
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
Caesar
and
the
pope
hastened
to
lay
hands
on
the
heritage
,
under
*NL*
presence
of
seeking
for
the
papers
of
the
dead
man
.
But
the
inheritance
*NL*
consisted
in
this
only
,
a
scrap
of
paper
on
which
Spada
had
written
:
--
'
I
*NL*
bequeath
to
my
beloved
nephew
my
coffers
,
my
books
,
and
,
amongst
others
,
*NL*
my
breviary
with
the
gold
corners
,
which
I
beg
he
will
preserve
in
*NL*
remembrance
of
his
affectionate
uncle
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
heirs
sought
everywhere
,
admired
the
breviary
,
laid
hands
on
the
*NL*
furniture
,
and
were
greatly
astonished
that
Spada
,
the
rich
man
,
was
*NL*
really
the
most
miserable
of
uncles
--
no
treasures
--
unless
they
were
*NL*
those
of
science
,
contained
in
the
library
and
laboratories
.
That
was
*NL*
all
.
Caesar
and
his
father
searched
,
examined
,
scrutinized
,
but
found
*NL*
nothing
,
or
at
least
very
little
;
not
exceeding
a
few
thousand
crowns
in
*NL*
plate
,
and
about
the
same
in
ready
money
;
but
the
nephew
had
time
to
say
*NL*
to
his
wife
before
he
expired
:
`
Look
well
among
my
uncle
's
papers
;
there
*NL*
is
a
will
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
sought
even
more
thoroughly
than
the
august
heirs
had
done
,
but
it
*NL*
was
fruitless
.
There
were
two
palaces
and
a
vineyard
behind
the
Palatine
*NL*
Hill
;
but
in
these
days
landed
property
had
not
much
value
,
and
the
two
*NL*
palaces
and
the
vineyard
remained
to
the
family
since
they
were
beneath
*NL*
the
rapacity
of
the
pope
and
his
son
.
Months
and
years
rolled
on
.
*NL*
Alexander
VI
.
died
,
poisoned
,
--
you
know
by
what
mistake
.
Caesar
,
*NL*
poisoned
at
the
same
time
,
escaped
by
shedding
his
skin
like
a
snake
;
*NL*
but
the
new
skin
was
spotted
by
the
poison
till
it
looked
like
a
*NL*
tiger
's
.
Then
,
compelled
to
quit
Rome
,
he
went
and
got
himself
obscurely
*NL*
killed
in
a
night
skirmish
,
scarcely
noticed
in
history
.
After
the
*NL*
pope
's
death
and
his
son
's
exile
,
it
was
supposed
that
the
Spada
family
*NL*
would
resume
the
splendid
position
they
had
held
before
the
cardinal
's
*NL*
time
;
but
this
was
not
the
case
.
The
Spadas
remained
in
doubtful
ease
,
*NL*
a
mystery
hung
over
this
dark
affair
,
and
the
public
rumor
was
,
that
*NL*
Caesar
,
a
better
politician
than
his
father
,
had
carried
off
from
the
*NL*
pope
the
fortune
of
the
two
cardinals
.
I
say
the
two
,
because
Cardinal
*NL*
Rospigliosi
,
who
had
not
taken
any
precaution
,
was
completely
despoiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Up
to
this
point
,
''
said
Faria
,
interrupting
the
thread
of
his
*NL*
narrative
,
``
this
seems
to
you
very
meaningless
,
no
doubt
,
eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
friend
,
''
cried
Dantes
,
``
on
the
contrary
,
it
seems
as
if
I
were
*NL*
reading
a
most
interesting
narrative
;
go
on
,
I
beg
of
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
family
began
to
get
accustomed
to
their
obscurity
.
Years
rolled
*NL*
on
,
and
amongst
the
descendants
some
were
soldiers
,
others
diplomatists
;
*NL*
some
churchmen
,
some
bankers
;
some
grew
rich
,
and
some
were
ruined
.
I
*NL*
come
now
to
the
last
of
the
family
,
whose
secretary
I
was
--
the
Count
of
*NL*
Spada
.
I
had
often
heard
him
complain
of
the
disproportion
of
his
rank
*NL*
with
his
fortune
;
and
I
advised
him
to
invest
all
he
had
in
an
annuity
.
*NL*
He
did
so
,
and
thus
doubled
his
income
.
The
celebrated
breviary
remained
*NL*
in
the
family
,
and
was
in
the
count
's
possession
.
It
had
been
handed
*NL*
down
from
father
to
son
;
for
the
singular
clause
of
the
only
will
*NL*
that
had
been
found
,
had
caused
it
to
be
regarded
as
a
genuine
relic
,
*NL*
preserved
in
the
family
with
superstitious
veneration
.
It
was
an
*NL*
illuminated
book
,
with
beautiful
Gothic
characters
,
and
so
weighty
with
*NL*
gold
,
that
a
servant
always
carried
it
before
the
cardinal
on
days
of
*NL*
great
solemnity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
the
sight
of
papers
of
all
sorts
,
--
titles
,
contracts
,
parchments
,
*NL*
which
were
kept
in
the
archives
of
the
family
,
all
descending
from
*NL*
the
poisoned
cardinal
,
I
in
my
turn
examined
the
immense
bundles
of
*NL*
documents
,
like
twenty
servitors
,
stewards
,
secretaries
before
me
;
but
*NL*
in
spite
of
the
most
exhaustive
researches
,
I
found
--
nothing
.
Yet
I
had
*NL*
read
,
I
had
even
written
a
precise
history
of
the
Borgia
family
,
for
*NL*
the
sole
purpose
of
assuring
myself
whether
any
increase
of
fortune
had
*NL*
occurred
to
them
on
the
death
of
the
Cardinal
Caesar
Spada
;
but
could
*NL*
only
trace
the
acquisition
of
the
property
of
the
Cardinal
Rospigliosi
,
*NL*
his
companion
in
misfortune
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
then
almost
assured
that
the
inheritance
had
neither
profited
the
*NL*
Borgias
nor
the
family
,
but
had
remained
unpossessed
like
the
treasures
*NL*
of
the
Arabian
Nights
,
which
slept
in
the
bosom
of
the
earth
under
the
*NL*
eyes
of
the
genie
.
I
searched
,
ransacked
,
counted
,
calculated
a
thousand
*NL*
and
a
thousand
times
the
income
and
expenditure
of
the
family
for
three
*NL*
hundred
years
.
It
was
useless
.
I
remained
in
my
ignorance
,
and
the
*NL*
Count
of
Spada
in
his
poverty
.
My
patron
died
.
He
had
reserved
from
*NL*
his
annuity
his
family
papers
,
his
library
,
composed
of
five
thousand
*NL*
volumes
,
and
his
famous
breviary
.
All
these
he
bequeathed
to
me
,
with
a
*NL*
thousand
Roman
crowns
,
which
he
had
in
ready
money
,
on
condition
that
I
*NL*
would
have
anniversary
masses
said
for
the
repose
of
his
soul
,
and
that
*NL*
I
would
draw
up
a
genealogical
tree
and
history
of
his
house
.
All
this
I
*NL*
did
scrupulously
.
Be
easy

we
are
near
the
conclusion

*NL*
at
the
same
thing
,
and
overcome
by
a
heavy
dinner
I
had
eaten
,
my
*NL*
head
dropped
on
my
hands
,
and
I
fell
asleep
about
three
o'clock
in
the
*NL*
afternoon
.
I
awoke
as
the
clock
was
striking
six
.
I
raised
my
head
;
*NL*
I
was
in
utter
darkness
.
I
rang
for
a
light
,
but
as
no
one
came
,
I
*NL*
determined
to
find
one
for
myself
.
It
was
indeed
but
anticipating
the
*NL*
simple
manners
which
I
should
soon
be
under
the
necessity
of
adopting
.
*NL*
I
took
a
wax-candle
in
one
hand
,
and
with
the
other
groped
about
for
a
*NL*
piece
of
paper
-LRB-
my
match-box
being
empty
-RRB-
,
with
which
I
proposed
to
*NL*
get
a
light
from
the
small
flame
still
playing
on
the
embers
.
Fearing
,
*NL*
however
,
to
make
use
of
any
valuable
piece
of
paper
,
I
hesitated
for
a
*NL*
moment
,
then
recollected
that
I
had
seen
in
the
famous
breviary
,
which
*NL*
was
on
the
table
beside
me
,
an
old
paper
quite
yellow
with
age
,
and
*NL*
which
had
served
as
a
marker
for
centuries
,
kept
there
by
the
request
of
*NL*
the
heirs
.
I
felt
for
it
,
found
it
,
twisted
it
up
together
,
and
putting
*NL*
it
into
the
expiring
flame
,
set
light
to
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
beneath
my
fingers
,
as
if
by
magic
,
in
proportion
as
the
fire
*NL*
ascended
,
I
saw
yellowish
characters
appear
on
the
paper
.
I
grasped
it
*NL*
in
my
hand
,
put
out
the
flame
as
quickly
as
I
could
,
lighted
my
taper
*NL*
in
the
fire
itself
,
and
opened
the
crumpled
paper
with
inexpressible
*NL*
emotion
,
recognizing
,
when
I
had
done
so
,
that
these
characters
had
been
*NL*
traced
in
mysterious
and
sympathetic
ink
,
only
appearing
when
exposed
to
*NL*
the
fire
;
nearly
one-third
of
the
paper
had
been
consumed
by
the
flame
.
*NL*
It
was
that
paper
you
read
this
morning
;
read
it
again
,
Dantes
,
and
then
*NL*
I
will
complete
for
you
the
incomplete
words
and
unconnected
sense
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Faria
,
with
an
air
of
triumph
,
offered
the
paper
to
Dantes
,
who
this
*NL*
time
read
the
following
words
,
traced
with
an
ink
of
a
reddish
color
*NL*
resembling
rust
:

I
resolved

with

for

almost
paternal

at
the

*NL*
*NL*
``
Impossible

asked
the

The

which
they

can
not
touch

Edmond
thought
he
was
in
a

he
wavered
between
*NL*
incredulity
and
joy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
only
kept
this
secret
so
long
from

continued
Faria

I
should
have
conducted

he
added
,
with
a
sigh
,
``
it

will
conduct

Well

*NL*
*NL*
``
This

replied
Dantes
,
``
and
to

you

*NL*

``

extended

arm

The

Attack
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
that
this
treasure
,
which
had
so
long
been
the
object
of
the
abbe
's
*NL*
meditations
,
could
insure
the
future
happiness
of
him
whom
Faria
really
*NL*
loved
as
a
son
,
it
had
doubled
its
value
in
his
eyes
,
and
every
day
he
*NL*
expatiated
on
the
amount
,
explaining
to
Dantes
all
the
good
which
,
with
*NL*
thirteen
or
fourteen
millions
of
francs
,
a
man
could
do
in
these
days
to
*NL*
his
friends
;
and
then
Dantes
'
countenance
became
gloomy
,
for
the
oath
of
*NL*
vengeance
he
had
taken
recurred
to
his
memory
,
and
he
reflected
how
much
*NL*
ill
,
in
these
times
,
a
man
with
thirteen
or
fourteen
millions
could
do
*NL*
to
his
enemies
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
abbe
did
not
know
the
Island
of
Monte
Cristo
;
but
Dantes
knew
*NL*
it
,
and
had
often
passed
it
,
situated
twenty-five
miles
from
Pianosa
,
*NL*
between
Corsica
and
the
Island
of
Elba
,
and
had
once
touched
there
.
This
*NL*
island
was
,
always
had
been
,
and
still
is
,
completely
deserted
.
It
is
a
*NL*
rock
of
almost
conical
form
,
which
looks
as
though
it
had
been
thrust
*NL*
up
by
volcanic
force
from
the
depth
to
the
surface
of
the
ocean
.
Dantes
*NL*
drew
a
plan
of
the
island
for
Faria
,
and
Faria
gave
Dantes
advice
as
to
*NL*
the
means
he
should
employ
to
recover
the
treasure
.
But
Dantes
was
far
*NL*
from
being
as
enthusiastic
and
confident
as
the
old
man
.
It
was
past
a
*NL*
question
now
that
Faria
was
not
a
lunatic
,
and
the
way
in
which
he
had
*NL*
achieved
the
discovery
,
which
had
given
rise
to
the
suspicion
of
his
*NL*
madness
,
increased
Edmond
's
admiration
of
him
;
but
at
the
same
time
*NL*
Dantes
could
not
believe
that
the
deposit
,
supposing
it
had
ever
*NL*
existed
,
still
existed
;
and
though
he
considered
the
treasure
as
by
no
*NL*
means
chimerical
,
he
yet
believed
it
was
no
longer
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
as
if
fate
resolved
on
depriving
the
prisoners
of
their
last
*NL*
chance
,
and
making
them
understand
that
they
were
condemned
to
perpetual
*NL*
imprisonment
,
a
new
misfortune
befell
them
;
the
gallery
on
the
sea
*NL*
side
,
which
had
long
been
in
ruins
,
was
rebuilt
.
They
had
repaired
it
*NL*
completely
,
and
stopped
up
with
vast
masses
of
stone
the
hole
Dantes
had
*NL*
partly
filled
in
.
But
for
this
precaution
,
which
,
it
will
be
remembered
,
*NL*
the
abbe
had
made
to
Edmond
,
the
misfortune
would
have
been
still
*NL*
greater
,
for
their
attempt
to
escape
would
have
been
detected
,
and
they
*NL*
would
undoubtedly
have
been
separated
.
Thus
a
new
,
a
stronger
,
and
more
*NL*
inexorable
barrier
was
interposed
to
cut
off
the
realization
of
their
*NL*
hopes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
''
said
the
young
man
,
with
an
air
of
sorrowful
resignation
,
to
*NL*
Faria
,
``
that
God
deems
it
right
to
take
from
me
any
claim
to
merit
for
*NL*
what
you
call
my
devotion
to
you
.
I
have
promised
to
remain
forever
with
*NL*
you
,
and
now
I
could
not
break
my
promise
if
I
would
.
The
treasure
will
*NL*
be
no
more
mine
than
yours
,
and
neither
of
us
will
quit
this
prison
.
But
*NL*
my
real
treasure
is
not
that
,
my
dear
friend
,
which
awaits
me
beneath
*NL*
the
sombre
rocks
of
Monte
Cristo
,
it
is
your
presence
,
our
living
*NL*
together
five
or
six
hours
a
day
,
in
spite
of
our
jailers
;
it
is
the
*NL*
rays
of
intelligence
you
have
elicited
from
my
brain
,
the
languages
you
*NL*
have
implanted
in
my
memory
,
and
which
have
taken
root
there
with
all
*NL*
their
philological
ramifications
.
These
different
sciences
that
you
have
*NL*
made
so
easy
to
me
by
the
depth
of
the
knowledge
you
possess
of
them
,
*NL*
and
the
clearness
of
the
principles
to
which
you
have
reduced
them
--
this
*NL*
is
my
treasure
,
my
beloved
friend
,
and
with
this
you
have
made
me
rich
*NL*
and
happy
.
Believe
me
,
and
take
comfort
,
this
is
better
for
me
than
tons
*NL*
of
gold
and
cases
of
diamonds
,
even
were
they
not
as
problematical
as
*NL*
the
clouds
we
see
in
the
morning
floating
over
the
sea
,
which
we
take
*NL*
for
terra
firma
,
and
which
evaporate
and
vanish
as
we
draw
near
to
*NL*
them
.
To
have
you
as
long
as
possible
near
me
,
to
hear
your
eloquent
*NL*
speech
,
--
which
embellishes
my
mind
,
strengthens
my
soul
,
and
makes
my
*NL*
whole
frame
capable
of
great
and
terrible
things
,
if
I
should
ever
be
*NL*
free
,
--
so
fills
my
whole
existence
,
that
the
despair
to
which
I
was
just
*NL*
on
the
point
of
yielding
when
I
knew
you
,
has
no
longer
any
hold
over
*NL*
me
;
and
this
--
this
is
my
fortune
--
not
chimerical
,
but
actual
.
I
owe
you
*NL*
my
real
good
,
my
present
happiness
;
and
all
the
sovereigns
of
the
earth
,
*NL*
even
Caesar
Borgia
himself
,
could
not
deprive
me
of
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
,
if
not
actually
happy
,
yet
the
days
these
two
unfortunates
passed
*NL*
together
went
quickly
.
Faria
,
who
for
so
long
a
time
had
kept
silence
*NL*
as
to
the
treasure
,
now
perpetually
talked
of
it
.
As
he
had
prophesied
*NL*
would
be
the
case
,
he
remained
paralyzed
in
the
right
arm
and
the
left
*NL*
leg
,
and
had
given
up
all
hope
of
ever
enjoying
it
himself
.
But
he
was
*NL*
continually
thinking
over
some
means
of
escape
for
his
young
companion
,
*NL*
and
anticipating
the
pleasure
he
would
enjoy
.
For
fear
the
letter
might
*NL*
be
some
day
lost
or
stolen
,
he
compelled
Dantes
to
learn
it
by
heart
;
*NL*
and
Dantes
knew
it
from
the
first
to
the
last
word
.
Then
he
destroyed
*NL*
the
second
portion
,
assured
that
if
the
first
were
seized
,
no
one
would
*NL*
be
able
to
discover
its
real
meaning
.
Whole
hours
sometimes
passed
while
*NL*
Faria
was
giving
instructions
to
Dantes
,
--
instructions
which
were
to
*NL*
serve
him
when
he
was
at
liberty
.
Then
,
once
free
,
from
the
day
and
hour
*NL*
and
moment
when
he
was
so
,
he
could
have
but
one
only
thought
,
which
*NL*
was
,
to
gain
Monte
Cristo
by
some
means
,
and
remain
there
alone
under
*NL*
some
pretext
which
would
arouse
no
suspicions
;
and
once
there
,
to
*NL*
endeavor
to
find
the
wonderful
caverns
,
and
search
in
the
appointed
*NL*
spot
,
--
the
appointed
spot
,
be
it
remembered
,
being
the
farthest
angle
in
*NL*
the
second
opening
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meanwhile
the
hours
passed
,
if
not
rapidly
,
at
least
tolerably
.
*NL*
Faria
,
as
we
have
said
,
without
having
recovered
the
use
of
his
hand
*NL*
and
foot
,
had
regained
all
the
clearness
of
his
understanding
,
and
had
*NL*
gradually
,
besides
the
moral
instructions
we
have
detailed
,
taught
*NL*
his
youthful
companion
the
patient
and
sublime
duty
of
a
prisoner
,
*NL*
who
learns
to
make
something
from
nothing
.
They
were
thus
perpetually
*NL*
employed
,
--
Faria
,
that
he
might
not
see
himself
grow
old
;
Dantes
,
for
*NL*
fear
of
recalling
the
almost
extinct
past
which
now
only
floated
in
his
*NL*
memory
like
a
distant
light
wandering
in
the
night
.
So
life
went
on
for
*NL*
them
as
it
does
for
those
who
are
not
victims
of
misfortune
and
whose
*NL*
activities
glide
along
mechanically
and
tranquilly
beneath
the
eye
of
*NL*
providence
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
beneath
this
superficial
calm
there
were
in
the
heart
of
the
young
*NL*
man
,
and
perhaps
in
that
of
the
old
man
,
many
repressed
desires
,
many
*NL*
stifled
sighs
,
which
found
vent
when
Faria
was
left
alone
,
and
when
*NL*
Edmond
returned
to
his
cell
.
One
night
Edmond
awoke
suddenly
,
believing
*NL*
that
he
heard
some
one
calling
him
.
He
opened
his
eyes
upon
utter
*NL*
darkness
.
His
name
,
or
rather
a
plaintive
voice
which
essayed
to
*NL*
pronounce
his
name
,
reached
him
.
He
sat
up
in
bed
and
a
cold
sweat
*NL*
broke
out
upon
his
brow
.
Undoubtedly
the
call
came
from
Faria
's
dungeon
.
*NL*
``
Alas
,
''
murmured
Edmond
;
``
can
it
be
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
moved
his
bed
,
drew
up
the
stone
,
rushed
into
the
passage
,
and
*NL*
reached
the
opposite
extremity
;
the
secret
entrance
was
open
.
By
the
*NL*
light
of
the
wretched
and
wavering
lamp
,
of
which
we
have
spoken
,
Dantes
*NL*
saw
the
old
man
,
pale
,
but
yet
erect
,
clinging
to
the
bedstead
.
His
*NL*
features
were
writhing
with
those
horrible
symptoms
which
he
already
*NL*
knew
,
and
which
had
so
seriously
alarmed
him
when
he
saw
them
for
the
*NL*
first
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas
,
my
dear
friend
,
''
said
Faria
in
a
resigned
tone
,
``
you
understand
,
*NL*
do
you
not
,
and
I
need
not
attempt
to
explain
to
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Edmond
uttered
a
cry
of
agony
,
and
,
quite
out
of
his
senses
,
rushed
*NL*
towards
the
door
,
exclaiming
,
``
Help
,
help
!
''
Faria
had
just
sufficient
*NL*
strength
to
restrain
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Silence
,
''
he
said
,
``
or
you
are
lost
.
We
must
now
only
think
of
you
,
my
*NL*
dear
friend
,
and
so
act
as
to
render
your
captivity
supportable
or
your
*NL*
flight
possible
.
It
would
require
years
to
do
again
what
I
have
done
*NL*
here
,
and
the
results
would
be
instantly
destroyed
if
our
jailers
*NL*
knew
we
had
communicated
with
each
other
.
Besides
,
be
assured
,
my
dear
*NL*
Edmond
,
the
dungeon
I
am
about
to
leave
will
not
long
remain
empty
;
some
*NL*
other
unfortunate
being
will
soon
take
my
place
,
and
to
him
you
will
*NL*
appear
like
an
angel
of
salvation
.
Perhaps
he
will
be
young
,
strong
,
and
*NL*
enduring
,
like
yourself
,
and
will
aid
you
in
your
escape
,
while
I
have
*NL*
been
but
a
hindrance
.
You
will
no
longer
have
half
a
dead
body
tied
*NL*
to
you
as
a
drag
to
all
your
movements
.
At
length
providence
has
done
*NL*
something
for
you
;
he
restores
to
you
more
than
he
takes
away
,
and
it
*NL*
was
time
I
should
die
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Edmond
could
only
clasp
his
hands
and
exclaim
,
``
Oh
,
my
friend
,
my
*NL*
friend
,
speak
not
thus
!
''
and
then
resuming
all
his
presence
of
mind
,
*NL*
which
had
for
a
moment
staggered
under
this
blow
,
and
his
strength
,
*NL*
which
had
failed
at
the
words
of
the
old
man
,
he
said
,
``
Oh
,
I
have
saved
*NL*
you
once
,
and
I
will
save
you
a
second
time
!
''
And
raising
the
foot
*NL*
of
the
bed
,
he
drew
out
the
phial
,
still
a
third
filled
with
the
red
*NL*
liquor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
See
,
''
he
exclaimed
,
``
there
remains
still
some
of
the
magic
draught
.
*NL*
Quick
,
quick
!
tell
me
what
I
must
do
this
time
;
are
there
any
fresh
*NL*
instructions
?
Speak
,
my
friend
;
I
listen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
not
a
hope
,
''
replied
Faria
,
shaking
his
head
,
``
but
no
matter
;
*NL*
God
wills
it
that
man
whom
he
has
created
,
and
in
whose
heart
he
has
*NL*
so
profoundly
rooted
the
love
of
life
,
should
do
all
in
his
power
to
*NL*
preserve
that
existence
,
which
,
however
painful
it
may
be
,
is
yet
always
*NL*
so
dear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
yes
!
''
exclaimed
Dantes
;
``
and
I
tell
you
that
I
will
save
you
*NL*
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
try
.
The
cold
gains
upon
me
.
I
feel
the
blood
flowing
*NL*
towards
my
brain
.
These
horrible
chills
,
which
make
my
teeth
chatter
*NL*
and
seem
to
dislocate
my
bones
,
begin
to
pervade
my
whole
frame
;
in
five
*NL*
minutes
the
malady
will
reach
its
height
,
and
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
*NL*
there
will
be
nothing
left
of
me
but
a
corpse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
exclaimed
Dantes
,
his
heart
wrung
with
anguish
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
as
you
did
before
,
only
do
not
wait
so
long
,
all
the
springs
of
*NL*
life
are
now
exhausted
in
me
,
and
death
,
''
he
continued
,
looking
at
his
*NL*
paralyzed
arm
and
leg
,
``
has
but
half
its
work
to
do
.
If
,
after
having
*NL*
made
me
swallow
twelve
drops
instead
of
ten
,
you
see
that
I
do
not
*NL*
recover
,
then
pour
the
rest
down
my
throat
.
Now
lift
me
on
my
bed
,
for
I
*NL*
can
no
longer
support
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Edmond
took
the
old
man
in
his
arms
,
and
laid
him
on
the
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
,
my
dear
friend
,
''
said
Faria
,
``
sole
consolation
of
my
wretched
*NL*
existence
,
--
you
whom
heaven
gave
me
somewhat
late
,
but
still
gave
me
,
*NL*
a
priceless
gift
,
and
for
which
I
am
most
grateful
,
--
at
the
moment
of
*NL*
separating
from
you
forever
,
I
wish
you
all
the
happiness
and
all
the
*NL*
prosperity
you
so
well
deserve
.
My
son
,
I
bless
thee
!
''
The
young
man
*NL*
cast
himself
on
his
knees
,
leaning
his
head
against
the
old
man
's
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
,
now
,
to
what
I
say
in
this
my
dying
moment
.
The
treasure
of
the
*NL*
Spadas
exists
.
God
grants
me
the
boon
of
vision
unrestricted
by
time
or
*NL*
space
.
I
see
it
in
the
depths
of
the
inner
cavern
.
My
eyes
pierce
the
*NL*
inmost
recesses
of
the
earth
,
and
are
dazzled
at
the
sight
of
so
much
*NL*
riches
.
If
you
do
escape
,
remember
that
the
poor
abbe
,
whom
all
the
*NL*
world
called
mad
,
was
not
so
.
Hasten
to
Monte
Cristo
--
avail
yourself
*NL*
of
the
fortune
--
for
you
have
indeed
suffered
long
enough
.
''
A
violent
*NL*
convulsion
attacked
the
old
man
.
Dantes
raised
his
head
and
saw
Faria
's
*NL*
eyes
injected
with
blood
.
It
seemed
as
if
a
flow
of
blood
had
ascended
*NL*
from
the
chest
to
the
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Adieu
,
adieu
!
''
murmured
the
old
man
,
clasping
Edmond
's
hand
*NL*
convulsively
--
``
adieu
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
--
no
,
not
yet
,
''
he
cried
;
``
do
not
forsake
me
!
Oh
,
succor
him
!
*NL*
Help
--
help
--
help
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hush
--
hush
!
''
murmured
the
dying
man
,
``
that
they
may
not
separate
us
if
*NL*
you
save
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
right
.
Oh
,
yes
,
yes
;
be
assured
I
shall
save
you
!
Besides
,
*NL*
although
you
suffer
much
,
you
do
not
seem
to
be
in
such
agony
as
you
*NL*
were
before
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
not
mistake
.
I
suffer
less
because
there
is
in
me
less
strength
to
*NL*
endure
.
At
your
age
we
have
faith
in
life
;
it
is
the
privilege
of
*NL*
youth
to
believe
and
hope
,
but
old
men
see
death
more
clearly
.
Oh
,
't
is
*NL*
here
--
't
is
here
--
't
is
over
--
my
sight
is
gone
--
my
senses
fail
!
Your
hand
,
*NL*
Dantes
!
Adieu
--
adieu
!
''
And
raising
himself
by
a
final
effort
,
in
which
*NL*
he
summoned
all
his
faculties
,
he
said
,
--
``
Monte
Cristo
,
forget
not
Monte
*NL*
Cristo
!
''
And
he
fell
back
on
the
bed
.
The
crisis
was
terrible
,
and
a
*NL*
rigid
form
with
twisted
limbs
,
swollen
eyelids
,
and
lips
flecked
with
*NL*
bloody
foam
,
lay
on
the
bed
of
torture
,
in
place
of
the
intellectual
*NL*
being
who
so
lately
rested
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dantes
took
the
lamp
,
placed
it
on
a
projecting
stone
above
the
bed
,
*NL*
whence
its
tremulous
light
fell
with
strange
and
fantastic
ray
on
the
*NL*
distorted
countenance
and
motionless
,
stiffened
body
.
With
steady
gaze
*NL*
he
awaited
confidently
the
moment
for
administering
the
restorative
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
believed
that
the
right
moment
had
arrived
,
he
took
the
knife
,
*NL*
pried
open
the
teeth
,
which
offered
less
resistance
than
before
,
counted
*NL*
one
after
the
other
twelve
drops
,
and
watched
;
the
phial
contained
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
twice
as
much
more
.
He
waited
ten
minutes
,
a
quarter
of
an
*NL*
hour
,
half
an
hour
,
--
no
change
took
place
.
Trembling
,
his
hair
erect
,
*NL*
his
brow
bathed
with
perspiration
,
he
counted
the
seconds
by
the
beating
*NL*
of
his
heart
.
Then
he
thought
it
was
time
to
make
the
last
trial
,
and
he
*NL*
put
the
phial
to
the
purple
lips
of
Faria
,
and
without
having
occasion
*NL*
to
force
open
his
jaws
,
which
had
remained
extended
,
he
poured
the
whole
*NL*
of
the
liquid
down
his
throat
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
draught
produced
a
galvanic
effect
,
a
violent
trembling
pervaded
the
*NL*
old
man
's
limbs
,
his
eyes
opened
until
it
was
fearful
to
gaze
upon
them
,
*NL*
he
heaved
a
sigh
which
resembled
a
shriek
,
and
then
his
convulsed
body
*NL*
returned
gradually
to
its
former
immobility
,
the
eyes
remaining
open
.
*NL*
*NL*
Half
an
hour
,
an
hour
,
an
hour
and
a
half
elapsed
,
and
during
this
*NL*
period
of
anguish
,
Edmond
leaned
over
his
friend
,
his
hand
applied
*NL*
to
his
heart
,
and
felt
the
body
gradually
grow
cold
,
and
the
heart
's
*NL*
pulsation
become
more
and
more
deep
and
dull
,
until
at
length
it
*NL*
stopped
;
the
last
movement
of
the
heart
ceased
,
the
face
became
livid
,
*NL*
the
eyes
remained
open
,
but
the
eyeballs
were
glazed
.
It
was
six
o'clock
*NL*
in
the
morning
,
the
dawn
was
just
breaking
,
and
its
feeble
ray
came
*NL*
into
the
dungeon
,
and
paled
the
ineffectual
light
of
the
lamp
.
Strange
*NL*
shadows
passed
over
the
countenance
of
the
dead
man
,
and
at
times
gave
*NL*
it
the
appearance
of
life
.
While
the
struggle
between
day
and
night
*NL*
lasted
,
Dantes
still
doubted
;
but
as
soon
as
the
daylight
gained
the
*NL*
pre-eminence
,
he
saw
that
he
was
alone
with
a
corpse
.
Then
an
invincible
*NL*
and
extreme
terror
seized
upon
him
,
and
he
dared
not
again
press
the
*NL*
hand
that
hung
out
of
bed
,
he
dared
no
longer
to
gaze
on
those
fixed
*NL*
and
vacant
eyes
,
which
he
tried
many
times
to
close
,
but
in
vain
--
they
*NL*
opened
again
as
soon
as
shut
.
He
extinguished
the
lamp
,
carefully
*NL*
concealed
it
,
and
then
went
away
,
closing
as
well
as
he
could
the
*NL*
entrance
to
the
secret
passage
by
the
large
stone
as
he
descended
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
time
,
for
the
jailer
was
coming
.
On
this
occasion
he
began
*NL*
his
rounds
at
Dantes
'
cell
,
and
on
leaving
him
he
went
on
to
Faria
's
*NL*
dungeon
,
taking
thither
breakfast
and
some
linen
.
Nothing
betokened
that
*NL*
the
man
knew
anything
of
what
had
occurred
.
He
went
on
his
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dantes
was
then
seized
with
an
indescribable
desire
to
know
what
was
*NL*
going
on
in
the
dungeon
of
his
unfortunate
friend
.
He
therefore
*NL*
returned
by
the
subterraneous
gallery
,
and
arrived
in
time
to
hear
the
*NL*
exclamations
of
the
turnkey
,
who
called
out
for
help
.
Other
turnkeys
*NL*
came
,
and
then
was
heard
the
regular
tramp
of
soldiers
.
Last
of
all
came
*NL*
the
governor
.
*NL*
*NL*
Edmond
heard
the
creaking
of
the
bed
as
they
moved
the
corpse
,
heard
the
*NL*
voice
of
the
governor
,
who
asked
them
to
throw
water
on
the
dead
man
's
*NL*
face
;
and
seeing
that
,
in
spite
of
this
application
,
the
prisoner
did
*NL*
not
recover
,
they
sent
for
the
doctor
.
The
governor
then
went
out
,
*NL*
and
words
of
pity
fell
on
Dantes
'
listening
ears
,
mingled
with
brutal
*NL*
laughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
well
,
''
said
one
,
``
the
madman
has
gone
to
look
after
his
treasure
.
*NL*
Good
journey
to
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
all
his
millions
,
he
will
not
have
enough
to
pay
for
his
shroud
!
''
*NL*
said
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
added
a
third
voice
,
``
the
shrouds
of
the
Chateau
d'If
are
not
*NL*
dear
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
,
''
said
one
of
the
previous
speakers
,
``
as
he
was
a
churchman
,
*NL*
they
may
go
to
some
expense
in
his
behalf
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
may
give
him
the
honors
of
the
sack
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Edmond
did
not
lose
a
word
,
but
comprehended
very
little
of
what
was
*NL*
said
.
The
voices
soon
ceased
,
and
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
every
one
had
*NL*
left
the
cell
.
Still
he
dared
not
to
enter
,
as
they
might
have
left
some
*NL*
turnkey
to
watch
the
dead
.
He
remained
,
therefore
,
mute
and
motionless
,
*NL*
hardly
venturing
to
breathe
.
At
the
end
of
an
hour
,
he
heard
a
faint
*NL*
noise
,
which
increased
.
It
was
the
governor
who
returned
,
followed
by
*NL*
the
doctor
and
other
attendants
.
There
was
a
moment
's
silence
,
--
it
was
*NL*
evident
that
the
doctor
was
examining
the
dead
body
.
The
inquiries
soon
*NL*
commenced
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
doctor
analyzed
the
symptoms
of
the
malady
to
which
the
prisoner
had
*NL*
succumbed
,
and
declared
that
he
was
dead
.
Questions
and
answers
followed
*NL*
in
a
nonchalant
manner
that
made
Dantes
indignant
,
for
he
felt
that
all
*NL*
the
world
should
have
for
the
poor
abbe
a
love
and
respect
equal
to
his
*NL*
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
sorry
for
what
you
tell
me
,
''
said
the
governor
,
replying
to
*NL*
the
assurance
of
the
doctor
,
``
that
the
old
man
is
really
dead
;
for
he
*NL*
was
a
quiet
,
inoffensive
prisoner
,
happy
in
his
folly
,
and
required
no
*NL*
watching
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
added
the
turnkey
,
``
there
was
no
occasion
for
watching
him
:
he
*NL*
would
have
stayed
here
fifty
years
,
I
'll
answer
for
it
,
without
any
*NL*
attempt
to
escape
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Still
,
''
said
the
governor
,
``
I
believe
it
will
be
requisite
,
*NL*
notwithstanding
your
certainty
,
and
not
that
I
doubt
your
science
,
but
*NL*
in
discharge
of
my
official
duty
,
that
we
should
be
perfectly
assured
*NL*
that
the
prisoner
is
dead
.
''
There
was
a
moment
of
complete
silence
,
*NL*
during
which
Dantes
,
still
listening
,
knew
that
the
doctor
was
examining
*NL*
the
corpse
a
second
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
make
your
mind
easy
,
''
said
the
doctor
;
``
he
is
dead
.
I
will
*NL*
answer
for
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
,
sir
,
''
said
the
governor
,
persisting
,
``
that
we
are
not
content
*NL*
in
such
cases
as
this
with
such
a
simple
examination
.
In
spite
of
all
*NL*
appearances
,
be
so
kind
,
therefore
,
as
to
finish
your
duty
by
fulfilling
*NL*
the
formalities
described
by
law
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
the
irons
be
heated
,
''
said
the
doctor
;
``
but
really
it
is
a
useless
*NL*
precaution
.
''
This
order
to
heat
the
irons
made
Dantes
shudder
.
He
heard
*NL*
hasty
steps
,
the
creaking
of
a
door
,
people
going
and
coming
,
and
some
*NL*
minutes
afterwards
a
turnkey
entered
,
saying
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
is
the
brazier
,
lighted
.
''
There
was
a
moment
's
silence
,
and
then
*NL*
was
heard
the
crackling
of
burning
flesh
,
of
which
the
peculiar
*NL*
and
nauseous
smell
penetrated
even
behind
the
wall
where
Dantes
was
*NL*
listening
in
horror
.
The
perspiration
poured
forth
upon
the
young
man
's
*NL*
brow
,
and
he
felt
as
if
he
should
faint
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
sir
,
he
is
really
dead
,
''
said
the
doctor
;
``
this
burn
in
the
*NL*
heel
is
decisive
.
The
poor
fool
is
cured
of
his
folly
,
and
delivered
*NL*
from
his
captivity
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
n't
his
name
Faria
?
''
inquired
one
of
the
officers
who
accompanied
*NL*
the
governor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
;
and
,
as
he
said
,
it
was
an
ancient
name
.
He
was
,
too
,
very
*NL*
learned
,
and
rational
enough
on
all
points
which
did
not
relate
to
his
*NL*
treasure
;
but
on
that
,
indeed
,
he
was
intractable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
the
sort
of
malady
which
we
call
monomania
,
''
said
the
doctor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
had
never
anything
to
complain
of
?
''
said
the
governor
to
the
jailer
*NL*
who
had
charge
of
the
abbe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
,
sir
,
''
replied
the
jailer
,
``
never
;
on
the
contrary
,
he
sometimes
*NL*
amused
me
very
much
by
telling
me
stories
.
One
day
,
too
,
when
my
wife
*NL*
was
ill
,
he
gave
me
a
prescription
which
cured
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
ah
!
''
said
the
doctor
,
``
I
did
not
know
that
I
had
a
rival
;
but
I
*NL*
hope
,
governor
,
that
you
will
show
him
all
proper
respect
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
make
your
mind
easy
,
he
shall
be
decently
interred
in
the
*NL*
newest
sack
we
can
find
.
Will
that
satisfy
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Must
this
last
formality
take
place
in
your
presence
,
sir
?
''
inquired
a
*NL*
turnkey
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
.
But
make
haste
--
I
can
not
stay
here
all
day
.
''
Other
*NL*
footsteps
,
going
and
coming
,
were
now
heard
,
and
a
moment
afterwards
the
*NL*
noise
of
rustling
canvas
reached
Dantes
'
ears
,
the
bed
creaked
,
and
the
*NL*
heavy
footfall
of
a
man
who
lifts
a
weight
sounded
on
the
floor
;
then
*NL*
the
bed
again
creaked
under
the
weight
deposited
upon
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
evening
,
''
said
the
governor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
there
be
any
mass
?
''
asked
one
of
the
attendants
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
impossible
,
''
replied
the
governor
.
``
The
chaplain
of
the
chateau
*NL*
came
to
me
yesterday
to
beg
for
leave
of
absence
,
in
order
to
take
a
*NL*
trip
to
Hyeres
for
a
week
.
I
told
him
I
would
attend
to
the
prisoners
*NL*
in
his
absence
.
If
the
poor
abbe
had
not
been
in
such
a
hurry
,
he
might
*NL*
have
had
his
requiem
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pooh
,
pooh
;
''
said
the
doctor
,
with
the
impiety
usual
in
persons
of
his
*NL*
profession
;
``
he
is
a
churchman
.
God
will
respect
his
profession
,
and
not
*NL*
give
the
devil
the
wicked
delight
of
sending
him
a
priest
.
''
A
shout
of
*NL*
laughter
followed
this
brutal
jest
.
Meanwhile
the
operation
of
putting
*NL*
the
body
in
the
sack
was
going
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
evening
,
''
said
the
governor
,
when
the
task
was
ended
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
what
hour
?
''
inquired
a
turnkey
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
about
ten
or
eleven
o'clock
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
we
watch
by
the
corpse
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
what
use
would
it
be
?
Shut
the
dungeon
as
if
he
were
alive
--
that
*NL*
is
all
.
''
Then
the
steps
retreated
,
and
the
voices
died
away
in
the
*NL*
distance
;
the
noise
of
the
door
,
with
its
creaking
hinges
and
bolts
*NL*
ceased
,
and
a
silence
more
sombre
than
that
of
solitude
ensued
,
--
the
*NL*
silence
of
death
,
which
was
all-pervasive
,
and
struck
its
icy
chill
to
*NL*
the
very
soul
of
Dantes
.
Then
he
raised
the
flag-stone
cautiously
with
*NL*
his
head
,
and
looked
carefully
around
the
chamber
.
It
was
empty
,
and
*NL*
Dantes
emerged
from
the
tunnel
.

Chapter

The
Cemetery
of
the
Chateau
D'If
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
bed
,
at
full
length
,
and
faintly
illuminated
by
the
pale
light
*NL*
that
came
from
the
window
,
lay
a
sack
of
canvas
,
and
under
its
rude
*NL*
folds
was
stretched
a
long
and
stiffened
form
;
it
was
Faria
's
last
*NL*
winding-sheet
,
--
a
winding-sheet
which
,
as
the
turnkey
said
,
cost
so
*NL*
little
.
Everything
was
in
readiness
.
A
barrier
had
been
placed
between
*NL*
Dantes
and
his
old
friend
.
No
longer
could
Edmond
look
into
those
*NL*
wide-open
eyes
which
had
seemed
to
be
penetrating
the
mysteries
of
*NL*
death
;
no
longer
could
he
clasp
the
hand
which
had
done
so
much
to
make
*NL*
his
existence
blessed
.
Faria
,
the
beneficent
and
cheerful
companion
,
*NL*
with
whom
he
was
accustomed
to
live
so
intimately
,
no
longer
breathed
.
*NL*
He
seated
himself
on
the
edge
of
that
terrible
bed
,
and
fell
into
*NL*
melancholy
and
gloomy
revery
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alone
--
he
was
alone
again
--
again
condemned
to
silence
--
again
face
to
*NL*
face
with
nothingness
!
Alone
!
--
never
again
to
see
the
face
,
never
again
*NL*
to
hear
the
voice
of
the
only
human
being
who
united
him
to
earth
!
Was
*NL*
not
Faria
's
fate
the
better
,
after
all
--
to
solve
the
problem
of
life
at
*NL*
its
source
,
even
at
the
risk
of
horrible
suffering
?
The
idea
of
suicide
,
*NL*
which
his
friend
had
driven
away
and
kept
away
by
his
cheerful
presence
,
*NL*
now
hovered
like
a
phantom
over
the
abbe
's
dead
body
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
could
die
,
''
he
said
,
``
I
should
go
where
he
goes
,
and
should
*NL*
assuredly
find
him
again
.
But
how
to
die
?
It
is
very
easy
,
''
he
went
on
*NL*
with
a
smile
;
``
I
will
remain
here
,
rush
on
the
first
person
that
opens
*NL*
the
door
,
strangle
him
,
and
then
they
will
guillotine
me
.
''
But
excessive
*NL*
grief
is
like
a
storm
at
sea
,
where
the
frail
bark
is
tossed
from
the
*NL*
depths
to
the
top
of
the
wave
.
Dantes
recoiled
from
the
idea
of
so
*NL*
infamous
a
death
,
and
passed
suddenly
from
despair
to
an
ardent
desire
*NL*
for
life
and
liberty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Die
?
oh
,
no
,
''
he
exclaimed
--
``
not
die
now
,
after
having
lived
and
*NL*
suffered
so
long
and
so
much
!
Die
?
yes
,
had
I
died
years
ago
;
but
now
to
*NL*
die
would
be
,
indeed
,
to
give
way
to
the
sarcasm
of
destiny
.
No
,
I
want
*NL*
to
live
;
I
shall
struggle
to
the
very
last
;
I
will
yet
win
back
the
*NL*
happiness
of
which
I
have
been
deprived
.
Before
I
die
I
must
not
forget
*NL*
that
I
have
my
executioners
to
punish
,
and
perhaps
,
too
,
who
knows
,
some
*NL*
friends
to
reward
.
Yet
they
will
forget
me
here
,
and
I
shall
die
in
*NL*
my
dungeon
like
Faria
.
''
As
he
said
this
,
he
became
silent
and
gazed
*NL*
straight
before
him
like
one
overwhelmed
with
a
strange
and
amazing
*NL*
thought
.
Suddenly
he
arose
,
lifted
his
hand
to
his
brow
as
if
his
brain
*NL*
were
giddy
,
paced
twice
or
thrice
round
the
dungeon
,
and
then
paused
*NL*
abruptly
by
the
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
God
!
''
he
muttered
,
``
whence
comes
this
thought
?
Is
it
from
thee
?
*NL*
Since
none
but
the
dead
pass
freely
from
this
dungeon
,
let
me
take
*NL*
the
place
of
the
dead
!
''
Without
giving
himself
time
to
reconsider
*NL*
his
decision
,
and
,
indeed
,
that
he
might
not
allow
his
thoughts
to
be
*NL*
distracted
from
his
desperate
resolution
,
he
bent
over
the
appalling
*NL*
shroud
,
opened
it
with
the
knife
which
Faria
had
made
,
drew
the
corpse
*NL*
from
the
sack
,
and
bore
it
along
the
tunnel
to
his
own
chamber
,
laid
it
*NL*
on
his
couch
,
tied
around
its
head
the
rag
he
wore
at
night
around
his
*NL*
own
,
covered
it
with
his
counterpane
,
once
again
kissed
the
ice-cold
*NL*
brow
,
and
tried
vainly
to
close
the
resisting
eyes
,
which
glared
*NL*
horribly
,
turned
the
head
towards
the
wall
,
so
that
the
jailer
might
,
*NL*
when
he
brought
the
evening
meal
,
believe
that
he
was
asleep
,
as
was
*NL*
his
frequent
custom
;
entered
the
tunnel
again
,
drew
the
bed
against
the
*NL*
wall
,
returned
to
the
other
cell
,
took
from
the
hiding-place
the
needle
*NL*
and
thread
,
flung
off
his
rags
,
that
they
might
feel
only
naked
flesh
*NL*
beneath
the
coarse
canvas
,
and
getting
inside
the
sack
,
placed
himself
*NL*
in
the
posture
in
which
the
dead
body
had
been
laid
,
and
sewed
up
the
*NL*
mouth
of
the
sack
from
the
inside
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
would
have
been
discovered
by
the
beating
of
his
heart
,
if
by
any
*NL*
mischance
the
jailers
had
entered
at
that
moment
.
Dantes
might
have
*NL*
waited
until
the
evening
visit
was
over
,
but
he
was
afraid
that
the
*NL*
governor
would
change
his
mind
,
and
order
the
dead
body
to
be
removed
*NL*
earlier
.
In
that
case
his
last
hope
would
have
been
destroyed
.
Now
his
*NL*
plans
were
fully
made
,
and
this
is
what
he
intended
to
do
.
If
while
he
*NL*
was
being
carried
out
the
grave-diggers
should
discover
that
they
were
*NL*
bearing
a
live
instead
of
a
dead
body
,
Dantes
did
not
intend
to
give
*NL*
them
time
to
recognize
him
,
but
with
a
sudden
cut
of
the
knife
,
he
meant
*NL*
to
open
the
sack
from
top
to
bottom
,
and
,
profiting
by
their
alarm
,
*NL*
escape
;
if
they
tried
to
catch
him
,
he
would
use
his
knife
to
better
*NL*
purpose
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
they
took
him
to
the
cemetery
and
laid
him
in
a
grave
,
he
would
*NL*
allow
himself
to
be
covered
with
earth
,
and
then
,
as
it
was
night
,
the
*NL*
grave-diggers
could
scarcely
have
turned
their
backs
before
he
would
*NL*
have
worked
his
way
through
the
yielding
soil
and
escaped
.
He
hoped
that
*NL*
the
weight
of
earth
would
not
be
so
great
that
he
could
not
overcome
it
.
*NL*
If
he
was
detected
in
this
and
the
earth
proved
too
heavy
,
he
would
be
*NL*
stifled
,
and
then
--
so
much
the
better
,
all
would
be
over
.
Dantes
had
not
*NL*
eaten
since
the
preceding
evening
,
but
he
had
not
thought
of
hunger
,
nor
*NL*
did
he
think
of
it
now
.
His
situation
was
too
precarious
to
allow
him
*NL*
even
time
to
reflect
on
any
thought
but
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
risk
that
Dantes
ran
was
,
that
the
jailer
,
when
he
brought
*NL*
him
his
supper
at
seven
o'clock
,
might
perceive
the
change
that
had
been
*NL*
made
;
fortunately
,
twenty
times
at
least
,
from
misanthropy
or
fatigue
,
*NL*
Dantes
had
received
his
jailer
in
bed
,
and
then
the
man
placed
his
bread
*NL*
and
soup
on
the
table
,
and
went
away
without
saying
a
word
.
This
time
*NL*
the
jailer
might
not
be
as
silent
as
usual
,
but
speak
to
Dantes
,
and
*NL*
seeing
that
he
received
no
reply
,
go
to
the
bed
,
and
thus
discover
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
seven
o'clock
came
,
Dantes
'
agony
really
began
.
His
hand
placed
*NL*
upon
his
heart
was
unable
to
redress
its
throbbings
,
while
,
with
the
*NL*
other
he
wiped
the
perspiration
from
his
temples
.
From
time
to
time
*NL*
chills
ran
through
his
whole
body
,
and
clutched
his
heart
in
a
grasp
*NL*
of
ice
.
Then
he
thought
he
was
going
to
die
.
Yet
the
hours
passed
on
*NL*
without
any
unusual
disturbance
,
and
Dantes
knew
that
he
had
escaped
*NL*
the
first
peril
.
It
was
a
good
augury
.
At
length
,
about
the
hour
the
*NL*
governor
had
appointed
,
footsteps
were
heard
on
the
stairs
.
Edmond
*NL*
felt
that
the
moment
had
arrived
,
summoned
up
all
his
courage
,
held
*NL*
his
breath
,
and
would
have
been
happy
if
at
the
same
time
he
could
*NL*
have
repressed
the
throbbing
of
his
veins
.
The
footsteps
--
they
*NL*
were
double
--
paused
at
the
door
--
and
Dantes
guessed
that
the
two
*NL*
grave-diggers
had
come
to
seek
him
--
this
idea
was
soon
converted
*NL*
into
certainty
,
when
he
heard
the
noise
they
made
in
putting
down
the
*NL*
hand-bier
.
The
door
opened
,
and
a
dim
light
reached
Dantes
'
eyes
through
*NL*
the
coarse
sack
that
covered
him
;
he
saw
two
shadows
approach
his
bed
,
*NL*
a
third
remaining
at
the
door
with
a
torch
in
its
hand
.
The
two
men
,
*NL*
approaching
the
ends
of
the
bed
,
took
the
sack
by
its
extremities
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
heavy
though
for
an
old
and
thin
man
,
''
said
one
,
as
he
raised
the
*NL*
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
say
every
year
adds
half
a
pound
to
the
weight
of
the
bones
,
''
said
*NL*
another
,
lifting
the
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
tied
the
knot
?
''
inquired
the
first
speaker
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
would
be
the
use
of
carrying
so
much
more
weight
?
''
was
the
reply
,
*NL*
``
I
can
do
that
when
we
get
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
you
're
right
,
''
replied
the
companion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
knot
for
?
''
thought
Dantes
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
deposited
the
supposed
corpse
on
the
bier
.
Edmond
stiffened
himself
*NL*
in
order
to
play
the
part
of
a
dead
man
,
and
then
the
party
,
lighted
by
*NL*
the
man
with
the
torch
,
who
went
first
,
ascended
the
stairs
.
Suddenly
he
*NL*
felt
the
fresh
and
sharp
night
air
,
and
Dantes
knew
that
the
mistral
was
*NL*
blowing
.
It
was
a
sensation
in
which
pleasure
and
pain
were
strangely
*NL*
mingled
.
The
bearers
went
on
for
twenty
paces
,
then
stopped
,
putting
*NL*
the
bier
down
on
the
ground
.
One
of
them
went
away
,
and
Dantes
heard
his
*NL*
shoes
striking
on
the
pavement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
am
I
?
''
he
asked
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
,
he
is
by
no
means
a
light
load
!
''
said
the
other
bearer
,
sitting
*NL*
on
the
edge
of
the
hand-barrow
.
Dantes
'
first
impulse
was
to
escape
,
but
*NL*
fortunately
he
did
not
attempt
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
us
a
light
,
''
said
the
other
bearer
,
``
or
I
shall
never
find
what
I
*NL*
am
looking
for
.
''
The
man
with
the
torch
complied
,
although
not
asked
in
*NL*
the
most
polite
terms
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
can
he
be
looking
for
?
''
thought
Edmond
.
``
The
spade
,
perhaps
.
''
An
*NL*
exclamation
of
satisfaction
indicated
that
the
grave-digger
had
found
*NL*
the
object
of
his
search
.
``
Here
it
is
at
last
,
''
he
said
,
``
not
without
*NL*
some
trouble
though
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
was
the
answer
,
``
but
it
has
lost
nothing
by
waiting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
said
this
,
the
man
came
towards
Edmond
,
who
heard
a
heavy
metallic
*NL*
substance
laid
down
beside
him
,
and
at
the
same
moment
a
cord
was
*NL*
fastened
round
his
feet
with
sudden
and
painful
violence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
have
you
tied
the
knot
?
''
inquired
the
grave-digger
,
who
was
*NL*
looking
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
and
pretty
tight
too
,
I
can
tell
you
,
''
was
the
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Move
on
,
then
.
''
And
the
bier
was
lifted
once
more
,
and
they
proceeded
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
advanced
fifty
paces
farther
,
and
then
stopped
to
open
a
door
,
then
*NL*
went
forward
again
.
The
noise
of
the
waves
dashing
against
the
rocks
on
*NL*
which
the
chateau
is
built
,
reached
Dantes
'
ear
distinctly
as
they
went
*NL*
forward
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bad
weather
!
''
observed
one
of
the
bearers
;
``
not
a
pleasant
night
for
a
*NL*
dip
in
the
sea
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
yes
,
the
abbe
runs
a
chance
of
being
wet
,
''
said
the
other
;
and
*NL*
then
there
was
a
burst
of
brutal
laughter
.
Dantes
did
not
comprehend
the
*NL*
jest
,
but
his
hair
stood
erect
on
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
here
we
are
at
last
,
''
said
one
of
them
.
``
A
little
farther
--
a
*NL*
little
farther
,
''
said
the
other
.
``
You
know
very
well
that
the
last
was
*NL*
stopped
on
his
way
,
dashed
on
the
rocks
,
and
the
governor
told
us
next
*NL*
day
that
we
were
careless
fellows
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
ascended
five
or
six
more
steps
,
and
then
Dantes
felt
that
they
*NL*
took
him
,
one
by
the
head
and
the
other
by
the
heels
,
and
swung
him
to
*NL*
and
fro
.
``
One
!
''
said
the
grave-diggers
,
``
two
!
three
!
''
And
at
the
same
*NL*
instant
Dantes
felt
himself
flung
into
the
air
like
a
wounded
bird
,
*NL*
falling
,
falling
,
with
a
rapidity
that
made
his
blood
curdle
.
Although
*NL*
drawn
downwards
by
the
heavy
weight
which
hastened
his
rapid
descent
,
it
*NL*
seemed
to
him
as
if
the
fall
lasted
for
a
century
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
,
with
a
horrible
splash
,
he
darted
like
an
arrow
into
the
*NL*
ice-cold
water
,
and
as
he
did
so
he
uttered
a
shrill
cry
,
stifled
in
a
*NL*
moment
by
his
immersion
beneath
the
waves
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dantes
had
been
flung
into
the
sea
,
and
was
dragged
into
its
depths
by
*NL*
a
thirty-six
pound
shot
tied
to
his
feet
.
The
sea
is
the
cemetery
of
the
*NL*
Chateau
d'If
.

*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
21
.
The
Island
of
Tiboulen
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dantes
,
although
stunned
and
almost
suffocated
,
had
sufficient
presence
*NL*
of
mind
to
hold
his
breath
,
and
as
his
right
hand
-LRB-
prepared
as
he
was
*NL*
for
every
chance
-RRB-
held
his
knife
open
,
he
rapidly
ripped
up
the
sack
,
*NL*
extricated
his
arm
,
and
then
his
body
;
but
in
spite
of
all
his
efforts
*NL*
to
free
himself
from
the
shot
,
he
felt
it
dragging
him
down
still
lower
.
*NL*
He
then
bent
his
body
,
and
by
a
desperate
effort
severed
the
cord
that
*NL*
bound
his
legs
,
at
the
moment
when
it
seemed
as
if
he
were
actually
*NL*
strangled
.
With
a
mighty
leap
he
rose
to
the
surface
of
the
sea
,
while
*NL*
the
shot
dragged
down
to
the
depths
the
sack
that
had
so
nearly
become
*NL*
his
shroud
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dantes
waited
only
to
get
breath
,
and
then
dived
,
in
order
to
avoid
*NL*
being
seen
.
When
he
arose
a
second
time
,
he
was
fifty
paces
from
where
*NL*
he
had
first
sunk
.
He
saw
overhead
a
black
and
tempestuous
sky
,
across
*NL*
which
the
wind
was
driving
clouds
that
occasionally
suffered
a
twinkling
*NL*
star
to
appear
;
before
him
was
the
vast
expanse
of
waters
,
sombre
and
*NL*
terrible
,
whose
waves
foamed
and
roared
as
if
before
the
approach
of
*NL*
a
storm
.
Behind
him
,
blacker
than
the
sea
,
blacker
than
the
sky
,
rose
*NL*
phantom-like
the
vast
stone
structure
,
whose
projecting
crags
seemed
*NL*
like
arms
extended
to
seize
their
prey
,
and
on
the
highest
rock
was
a
*NL*
torch
lighting
two
figures
.
He
fancied
that
these
two
forms
were
looking
*NL*
at
the
sea
;
doubtless
these
strange
grave-diggers
had
heard
his
cry
.
*NL*
Dantes
dived
again
,
and
remained
a
long
time
beneath
the
water
.
This
was
*NL*
an
easy
feat
to
him
,
for
he
usually
attracted
a
crowd
of
spectators
in
*NL*
the
bay
before
the
lighthouse
at
Marseilles
when
he
swam
there
,
and
was
*NL*
unanimously
declared
to
be
the
best
swimmer
in
the
port
.
When
he
came
up
*NL*
again
the
light
had
disappeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
must
now
get
his
bearings
.
Ratonneau
and
Pomegue
are
the
nearest
*NL*
islands
of
all
those
that
surround
the
Chateau
d'If
,
but
Ratonneau
*NL*
and
Pomegue
are
inhabited
,
as
is
also
the
islet
of
Daume
.
Tiboulen
and
*NL*
Lemaire
were
therefore
the
safest
for
Dantes
'
venture
.
The
islands
*NL*
of
Tiboulen
and
Lemaire
are
a
league
from
the
Chateau
d'If
;
Dantes
,
*NL*
nevertheless
,
determined
to
make
for
them
.
But
how
could
he
find
his
*NL*
way
in
the
darkness
of
the
night
?
At
this
moment
he
saw
the
light
of
*NL*
Planier
,
gleaming
in
front
of
him
like
a
star
.
By
leaving
this
light
*NL*
on
the
right
,
he
kept
the
Island
of
Tiboulen
a
little
on
the
left
;
by
*NL*
turning
to
the
left
,
therefore
,
he
would
find
it
.
But
,
as
we
have
said
,
*NL*
it
was
at
least
a
league
from
the
Chateau
d'If
to
this
island
.
Often
*NL*
in
prison
Faria
had
said
to
him
,
when
he
saw
him
idle
and
inactive
,
*NL*
``
Dantes
,
you
must
not
give
way
to
this
listlessness
;
you
will
be
drowned
*NL*
if
you
seek
to
escape
,
and
your
strength
has
not
been
properly
exercised
*NL*
and
prepared
for
exertion
.
''
These
words
rang
in
Dantes
'
ears
,
even
*NL*
beneath
the
waves
;
he
hastened
to
cleave
his
way
through
them
to
see
if
*NL*
he
had
not
lost
his
strength
.
He
found
with
pleasure
that
his
captivity
*NL*
had
taken
away
nothing
of
his
power
,
and
that
he
was
still
master
of
*NL*
that
element
on
whose
bosom
he
had
so
often
sported
as
a
boy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fear
,
that
relentless
pursuer
,
clogged
Dantes
'
efforts
.
He
listened
for
*NL*
any
sound
that
might
be
audible
,
and
every
time
that
he
rose
to
the
top
*NL*
of
a
wave
he
scanned
the
horizon
,
and
strove
to
penetrate
the
darkness
.
*NL*
He
fancied
that
every
wave
behind
him
was
a
pursuing
boat
,
and
he
*NL*
redoubled
his
exertions
,
increasing
rapidly
his
distance
from
the
*NL*
chateau
,
but
exhausting
his
strength
.
He
swam
on
still
,
and
already
the
*NL*
terrible
chateau
had
disappeared
in
the
darkness
.
He
could
not
see
it
,
*NL*
but
he
felt
its
presence
.
An
hour
passed
,
during
which
Dantes
,
excited
*NL*
by
the
feeling
of
freedom
,
continued
to
cleave
the
waves
.
``
Let
us
see
,
''
*NL*
said
he
,
``
I
have
swum
above
an
hour
,
but
as
the
wind
is
against
me
,
that
*NL*
has
retarded
my
speed
;
however
,
if
I
am
not
mistaken
,
I
must
be
close
*NL*
to
Tiboulen
.
But
what
if
I
were
mistaken
?
''
A
shudder
passed
over
him
.
*NL*
He
sought
to
tread
water
,
in
order
to
rest
himself
;
but
the
sea
was
*NL*
too
violent
,
and
he
felt
that
he
could
not
make
use
of
this
means
of
*NL*
recuperation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
he
,
``
I
will
swim
on
until
I
am
worn
out
,
or
the
cramp
*NL*
seizes
me
,
and
then
I
shall
sink
;
''
and
he
struck
out
with
the
energy
of
*NL*
despair
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
the
sky
seemed
to
him
to
become
still
darker
and
more
dense
,
*NL*
and
heavy
clouds
seemed
to
sweep
down
towards
him
;
at
the
same
time
he
*NL*
felt
a
sharp
pain
in
his
knee
.
He
fancied
for
a
moment
that
he
had
been
*NL*
shot
,
and
listened
for
the
report
;
but
he
heard
nothing
.
Then
he
put
out
*NL*
his
hand
,
and
encountered
an
obstacle
and
with
another
stroke
knew
that
*NL*
he
had
gained
the
shore
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
him
rose
a
grotesque
mass
of
rocks
,
that
resembled
nothing
*NL*
so
much
as
a
vast
fire
petrified
at
the
moment
of
its
most
fervent
*NL*
combustion
.
It
was
the
Island
of
Tiboulen
.
Dantes
rose
,
advanced
a
few
*NL*
steps
,
and
,
with
a
fervent
prayer
of
gratitude
,
stretched
himself
on
*NL*
the
granite
,
which
seemed
to
him
softer
than
down
.
Then
,
in
spite
of
the
*NL*
wind
and
rain
,
he
fell
into
the
deep
,
sweet
sleep
of
utter
exhaustion
.
*NL*
At
the
expiration
of
an
hour
Edmond
was
awakened
by
the
roar
of
thunder
.
*NL*
The
tempest
was
let
loose
and
beating
the
atmosphere
with
its
mighty
*NL*
wings
;
from
time
to
time
a
flash
of
lightning
stretched
across
the
*NL*
heavens
like
a
fiery
serpent
,
lighting
up
the
clouds
that
rolled
on
in
*NL*
vast
chaotic
waves
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dantes
had
not
been
deceived
--
he
had
reached
the
first
of
the
two
*NL*
islands
,
which
was
,
in
fact
,
Tiboulen
.
He
knew
that
it
was
barren
and
*NL*
without
shelter
;
but
when
the
sea
became
more
calm
,
he
resolved
to
*NL*
plunge
into
its
waves
again
,
and
swim
to
Lemaire
,
equally
arid
,
but
*NL*
larger
,
and
consequently
better
adapted
for
concealment
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
overhanging
rock
offered
him
a
temporary
shelter
,
and
scarcely
had
*NL*
he
availed
himself
of
it
when
the
tempest
burst
forth
in
all
its
fury
.
*NL*
Edmond
felt
the
trembling
of
the
rock
beneath
which
he
lay
;
the
waves
,
*NL*
dashing
themselves
against
it
,
wetted
him
with
their
spray
.
He
was
*NL*
safely
sheltered
,
and
yet
he
felt
dizzy
in
the
midst
of
the
warring
of
*NL*
the
elements
and
the
dazzling
brightness
of
the
lightning
.
It
seemed
*NL*
to
him
that
the
island
trembled
to
its
base
,
and
that
it
would
,
like
a
*NL*
vessel
at
anchor
,
break
moorings
,
and
bear
him
off
into
the
centre
*NL*
of
the
storm
.
He
then
recollected
that
he
had
not
eaten
or
drunk
for
*NL*
four-and-twenty
hours
.
He
extended
his
hands
,
and
drank
greedily
of
the
*NL*
rainwater
that
had
lodged
in
a
hollow
of
the
rock
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
rose
,
a
flash
of
lightning
,
that
seemed
to
rive
the
remotest
*NL*
heights
of
heaven
,
illumined
the
darkness
.
By
its
light
,
between
the
*NL*
Island
of
Lemaire
and
Cape
Croiselle
,
a
quarter
of
a
league
distant
,
*NL*
Dantes
saw
a
fishing-boat
driven
rapidly
like
a
spectre
before
the
power
*NL*
of
winds
and
waves
.
A
second
after
,
he
saw
it
again
,
approaching
with
*NL*
frightful
rapidity
.
Dantes
cried
at
the
top
of
his
voice
to
warn
them
of
*NL*
their
danger
,
but
they
saw
it
themselves
.
Another
flash
showed
him
four
*NL*
men
clinging
to
the
shattered
mast
and
the
rigging
,
while
a
fifth
clung
*NL*
to
the
broken
rudder
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
men
he
beheld
saw
him
undoubtedly
,
for
their
cries
were
carried
to
*NL*
his
ears
by
the
wind
.
Above
the
splintered
mast
a
sail
rent
to
tatters
*NL*
was
waving
;
suddenly
the
ropes
that
still
held
it
gave
way
,
and
it
*NL*
disappeared
in
the
darkness
of
the
night
like
a
vast
sea-bird
.
At
the
*NL*
same
moment
a
violent
crash
was
heard
,
and
cries
of
distress
.
Dantes
*NL*
from
his
rocky
perch
saw
the
shattered
vessel
,
and
among
the
fragments
*NL*
the
floating
forms
of
the
hapless
sailors
.
Then
all
was
dark
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dantes
ran
down
the
rocks
at
the
risk
of
being
himself
dashed
to
pieces
;
*NL*
he
listened
,
he
groped
about
,
but
he
heard
and
saw
nothing
--
the
cries
*NL*
had
ceased
,
and
the
tempest
continued
to
rage
.
By
degrees
the
wind
*NL*
abated
,
vast
gray
clouds
rolled
towards
the
west
,
and
the
blue
firmament
*NL*
appeared
studded
with
bright
stars
.
Soon
a
red
streak
became
visible
in
*NL*
the
horizon
,
the
waves
whitened
,
a
light
played
over
them
,
and
gilded
*NL*
their
foaming
crests
with
gold
.
It
was
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dantes
stood
mute
and
motionless
before
this
majestic
spectacle
,
as
if
*NL*
he
now
beheld
it
for
the
first
time
;
and
indeed
since
his
captivity
*NL*
in
the
Chateau
d'If
he
had
forgotten
that
such
scenes
were
ever
to
be
*NL*
witnessed
.
He
turned
towards
the
fortress
,
and
looked
at
both
sea
and
*NL*
land
.
The
gloomy
building
rose
from
the
bosom
of
the
ocean
with
imposing
*NL*
majesty
and
seemed
to
dominate
the
scene
.
It
was
about
five
o'clock
.
The
*NL*
sea
continued
to
get
calmer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
two
or
three
hours
,
''
thought
Dantes
,
``
the
turnkey
will
enter
my
*NL*
chamber
,
find
the
body
of
my
poor
friend
,
recognize
it
,
seek
for
me
in
*NL*
vain
,
and
give
the
alarm
.
Then
the
tunnel
will
be
discovered
;
the
men
*NL*
who
cast
me
into
the
sea
and
who
must
have
heard
the
cry
I
uttered
,
will
*NL*
be
questioned
.
Then
boats
filled
with
armed
soldiers
will
pursue
the
*NL*
wretched
fugitive
.
The
cannon
will
warn
every
one
to
refuse
shelter
to
a
*NL*
man
wandering
about
naked
and
famished
.
The
police
of
Marseilles
will
be
*NL*
on
the
alert
by
land
,
whilst
the
governor
pursues
me
by
sea
.
I
am
cold
,
*NL*
I
am
hungry
.
I
have
lost
even
the
knife
that
saved
me
.
O
my
God
,
I
have
*NL*
suffered
enough
surely
!
Have
pity
on
me
,
and
do
for
me
what
I
am
unable
*NL*
to
do
for
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
Dantes
-LRB-
his
eyes
turned
in
the
direction
of
the
Chateau
d'If
-RRB-
uttered
*NL*
this
prayer
,
he
saw
off
the
farther
point
of
the
Island
of
Pomegue
a
*NL*
small
vessel
with
lateen
sail
skimming
the
sea
like
a
gull
in
search
of
*NL*
prey
;
and
with
his
sailor
's
eye
he
knew
it
to
be
a
Genoese
tartan
.
*NL*
She
was
coming
out
of
Marseilles
harbor
,
and
was
standing
out
to
sea
*NL*
rapidly
,
her
sharp
prow
cleaving
through
the
waves
.
``
Oh
,
''
cried
Edmond
,
*NL*
``
to
think
that
in
half
an
hour
I
could
join
her
,
did
I
not
fear
being
*NL*
questioned
,
detected
,
and
conveyed
back
to
Marseilles
!
What
can
I
do
?
*NL*
What
story
can
I
invent
?
under
pretext
of
trading
along
the
coast
,
these
*NL*
men
,
who
are
in
reality
smugglers
,
will
prefer
selling
me
to
doing
a
*NL*
good
action
.
I
must
wait
.
But
I
can
not
--
I
am
starving
.
In
a
few
hours
*NL*
my
strength
will
be
utterly
exhausted
;
besides
,
perhaps
I
have
not
been
*NL*
missed
at
the
fortress
.
I
can
pass
as
one
of
the
sailors
wrecked
last
*NL*
night
.
My
story
will
be
accepted
,
for
there
is
no
one
left
to
contradict
*NL*
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
spoke
,
Dantes
looked
toward
the
spot
where
the
fishing-vessel
had
*NL*
been
wrecked
,
and
started
.
The
red
cap
of
one
of
the
sailors
hung
to
a
*NL*
point
of
the
rock
and
some
timbers
that
had
formed
part
of
the
vessel
's
*NL*
keel
,
floated
at
the
foot
of
the
crag
.
In
an
instant
Dantes
'
plan
was
*NL*
formed
.
He
swam
to
the
cap
,
placed
it
on
his
head
,
seized
one
of
the
*NL*
timbers
,
and
struck
out
so
as
to
cut
across
the
course
the
vessel
was
*NL*
taking
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
saved
!
''
murmured
he
.
And
this
conviction
restored
his
strength
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
soon
saw
that
the
vessel
,
with
the
wind
dead
ahead
,
was
tacking
*NL*
between
the
Chateau
d'If
and
the
tower
of
Planier
.
For
an
instant
he
*NL*
feared
lest
,
instead
of
keeping
in
shore
,
she
should
stand
out
to
sea
;
*NL*
but
he
soon
saw
that
she
would
pass
,
like
most
vessels
bound
for
Italy
,
*NL*
between
the
islands
of
Jaros
and
Calaseraigne
.
However
,
the
vessel
and
*NL*
the
swimmer
insensibly
neared
one
another
,
and
in
one
of
its
tacks
*NL*
the
tartan
bore
down
within
a
quarter
of
a
mile
of
him
.
He
rose
on
the
*NL*
waves
,
making
signs
of
distress
;
but
no
one
on
board
saw
him
,
and
the
*NL*
vessel
stood
on
another
tack
.
Dantes
would
have
shouted
,
but
he
knew
*NL*
that
the
wind
would
drown
his
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
then
he
rejoiced
at
his
precaution
in
taking
the
timber
,
*NL*
for
without
it
he
would
have
been
unable
,
perhaps
,
to
reach
the
*NL*
vessel
--
certainly
to
return
to
shore
,
should
he
be
unsuccessful
in
*NL*
attracting
attention
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dantes
,
though
almost
sure
as
to
what
course
the
vessel
would
take
,
had
*NL*
yet
watched
it
anxiously
until
it
tacked
and
stood
towards
him
.
Then
*NL*
he
advanced
;
but
before
they
could
meet
,
the
vessel
again
changed
her
*NL*
course
.
By
a
violent
effort
he
rose
half
out
of
the
water
,
waving
his
*NL*
cap
,
and
uttering
a
loud
shout
peculiar
to
sailers
.
This
time
he
was
*NL*
both
seen
and
heard
,
and
the
tartan
instantly
steered
towards
him
.
At
*NL*
the
same
time
,
he
saw
they
were
about
to
lower
the
boat
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
instant
after
,
the
boat
,
rowed
by
two
men
,
advanced
rapidly
towards
*NL*
him
.
Dantes
let
go
of
the
timber
,
which
he
now
thought
to
be
useless
,
*NL*
and
swam
vigorously
to
meet
them
.
But
he
had
reckoned
too
much
upon
his
*NL*
strength
,
and
then
he
realized
how
serviceable
the
timber
had
been
to
*NL*
him
.
His
arms
became
stiff
,
his
legs
lost
their
flexibility
,
and
he
was
*NL*
almost
breathless
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
shouted
again
.
The
two
sailors
redoubled
their
efforts
,
and
one
of
*NL*
them
cried
in
Italian
,
``
Courage
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
word
reached
his
ear
as
a
wave
which
he
no
longer
had
the
strength
*NL*
to
surmount
passed
over
his
head
.
He
rose
again
to
the
surface
,
*NL*
struggled
with
the
last
desperate
effort
of
a
drowning
man
,
uttered
a
*NL*
third
cry
,
and
felt
himself
sinking
,
as
if
the
fatal
cannon
shot
were
*NL*
again
tied
to
his
feet
.
The
water
passed
over
his
head
,
and
the
sky
*NL*
turned
gray
.
A
convulsive
movement
again
brought
him
to
the
surface
.
He
*NL*
felt
himself
seized
by
the
hair
,
then
he
saw
and
heard
nothing
.
He
had
*NL*
fainted
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
opened
his
eyes
Dantes
found
himself
on
the
deck
of
the
tartan
.
*NL*
His
first
care
was
to
see
what
course
they
were
taking
.
They
were
*NL*
rapidly
leaving
the
Chateau
d'If
behind
.
Dantes
was
so
exhausted
that
*NL*
the
exclamation
of
joy
he
uttered
was
mistaken
for
a
sigh
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
we
have
said
,
he
was
lying
on
the
deck
.
A
sailor
was
rubbing
his
*NL*
limbs
with
a
woollen
cloth
;
another
,
whom
he
recognized
as
the
one
who
*NL*
had
cried
out
``
Courage
!
''
held
a
gourd
full
of
rum
to
his
mouth
;
while
*NL*
the
third
,
an
old
sailer
,
at
once
the
pilot
and
captain
,
looked
on
with
*NL*
that
egotistical
pity
men
feel
for
a
misfortune
that
they
have
escaped
*NL*
yesterday
,
and
which
may
overtake
them
to-morrow
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
drops
of
the
rum
restored
suspended
animation
,
while
the
friction
*NL*
of
his
limbs
restored
their
elasticity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
are
you
?

said
the
pilot
in
bad
French
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
,
''
replied
Dantes
,
in
bad
Italian
,
``
a
Maltese
sailor
.
We
were
*NL*
coming
from
Syracuse
laden
with
grain
.
The
storm
of
last
night
overtook
*NL*
us
at
Cape
Morgion
,
and
we
were
wrecked
on
these
rocks
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
do
you
come
from
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
these
rocks
that
I
had
the
good
luck
to
cling
to
while
our
captain
*NL*
and
the
rest
of
the
crew
were
all
lost
.
I
saw
your
vessel
,
and
fearful
*NL*
of
being
left
to
perish
on
the
desolate
island
,
I
swam
off
on
a
piece
of
*NL*
wreckage
to
try
and
intercept
your
course
.
You
have
saved
my
life
,
and
*NL*
I
thank
you
,
''
continued
Dantes
.
``
I
was
lost
when
one
of
your
sailors
*NL*
caught
hold
of
my
hair
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
I
,
''
said
a
sailor
of
a
frank
and
manly
appearance
;
``
and
it
was
*NL*
time
,
for
you
were
sinking
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
returned
Dantes
,
holding
out
his
hand
,
``
I
thank
you
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
almost
hesitated
,
though
,
''
replied
the
sailor
;
``
you
looked
more
like
*NL*
a
brigand
than
an
honest
man
,
with
your
beard
six
inches
,
and
your
hair
*NL*
a
foot
long
.
''
Dantes
recollected
that
his
hair
and
beard
had
not
been
*NL*
cut
all
the
time
he
was
at
the
Chateau
d'If
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
he
,
``
I
made
a
vow
,
to
our
Lady
of
the
Grotto
not
to
cut
my
*NL*
hair
or
beard
for
ten
years
if
I
were
saved
in
a
moment
of
danger
;
but
*NL*
to-day
the
vow
expires
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
what
are
we
to
do
with
you
?
''
said
the
captain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas
,
anything
you
please

My
captain
is
dead
;
I
have
barely
escaped
;
*NL*
but
I
am
a
good
sailor
.
Leave
me
at
the
first
port
you
make
;
I
shall
be
*NL*
sure
to
find
employment

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
the
Mediterranean

*NL*
*NL*

I
have

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
the
best
harbors

*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
few
ports
that
I
could
not
enter
or
leave
with
a
bandage
over
*NL*
my
eyes

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
,
captain
,
''
said
the
sailor
who
had
cried
``
Courage
!

to
Dantes
,
*NL*
``
if
what
he
says
is
true
,
what
hinders
his
staying
with
us
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
he
says
true
,
''
said
the
captain
doubtingly
.
``
But
in
his
present
*NL*
condition
he
will
promise
anything
,
and
take
his
chance
of
keeping
it
*NL*
afterwards
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
do
more
than
I
promise
,
''
said
Dantes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
shall
see
,
''
returned
the
other
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
are
you
going
?
''
asked
Dantes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
Leghorn
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
why
,
instead
of
tacking
so
frequently
,
do
you
not
sail
nearer
the
*NL*
wind
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
we
should
run
straight
on
to
the
Island
of
Rion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
shall
pass
it
by
twenty
fathoms
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
the
helm
,
and
let
us
see
what
you
know
.
''
The
young
man
took
the
*NL*
helm
,
felt
to
see
if
the
vessel
answered
the
rudder
promptly
and
*NL*
seeing
that
,
without
being
a
first-rate
sailer
,
she
yet
was
tolerably
*NL*
obedient
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
the
sheets
,
''
said
he
.
The
four
seamen
,
who
composed
the
crew
,
*NL*
obeyed
,
while
the
pilot
looked
on
.
``
Haul
taut
.
''
--
They
obeyed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Belay
.
''
This
order
was
also
executed
;
and
the
vessel
passed
,
as
Dantes
*NL*
had
predicted
,
twenty
fathoms
to
windward
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bravo
!
''
said
the
captain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bravo
!
''
repeated
the
sailors
.
And
they
all
looked
with
astonishment
at
*NL*
this
man
whose
eye
now
disclosed
an
intelligence
and
his
body
a
vigor
*NL*
they
had
not
thought
him
capable
of
showing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
''
said
Dantes
,
quitting
the
helm
,
``
I
shall
be
of
some
use
to
*NL*
you
,
at
least
during
the
voyage
.
If
you
do
not
want
me
at
Leghorn
,
you
*NL*
can
leave
me
there
,
and
I
will
pay
you
out
of
the
first
wages
I
get
,
for
*NL*
my
food
and
the
clothes
you
lend
me

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
said
the
captain
,
``
we
can
agree
very
well
,
if
you
are
reasonable

*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
me
what
you
give
the
others

it
will
be
all
right

''
returned
*NL*
Dantes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
not
fair
,
''
said
the
seaman
who
had
saved
Dantes
;
``
for
you
know
*NL*
more
than
we
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
that
to
you
,
Jacopo
?
''
returned
the
Captain
.
``
Every
one
is
free
*NL*
to
ask
what
he
pleases
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
true
,
''
replied
Jacopo
;
``
I
only
make
a
remark
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
would
do
much
better
to
find
him
a
jacket
and
a
pair
of
*NL*
trousers
,
if
you
have
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Jacopo
;
``
but
I
have
a
shirt
and
a
pair
of
trousers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
all
I
want
,
''
interrupted
Dantes
.
Jacopo
dived
into
the
hold
and
*NL*
soon
returned
with
what
Edmond
wanted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
then
,
do
you
wish
for
anything
else
?
''
said
the
patron
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
piece
of
bread
and
another
glass
of
the
capital
rum
I
tasted
,
for
*NL*
I
have
not
eaten
or
drunk
for
a
long
time
.
''
He
had
not
tasted
food
for
*NL*
forty
hours
.
A
piece
of
bread
was
brought
,
and
Jacopo
offered
him
the
*NL*
gourd
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Larboard
your
helm
,
''
cried
the
captain
to
the
steersman
.
Dantes
glanced
*NL*
that
way
as
he
lifted
the
gourd
to
his
mouth
;
then
paused
with
hand
in
*NL*
mid-air
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hollo
!
what
's
the
matter
at
the
Chateau
d'If
?
''
said
the
captain
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
small
white
cloud
,
which
had
attracted
Dantes
'
attention
,
crowned
the
*NL*
summit
of
the
bastion
of
the
Chateau
d'If
.
At
the
same
moment
the
faint
*NL*
report
of
a
gun
was
heard
.
The
sailors
looked
at
one
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
this
?
''
asked
the
captain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
prisoner
has
escaped
from
the
Chateau
d'If
,
and
they
are
firing
*NL*
the
alarm
gun
,
''
replied
Dantes
.
The
captain
glanced
at
him
,
but
he
had
*NL*
lifted
the
rum
to
his
lips
and
was
drinking
it
with
so
much
composure
,
*NL*
that
suspicions
,
if
the
captain
had
any
,
died
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
any
rate
,
''
murmured
he
,
``
if
it
be
,
so
much
the
better
,
for
I
have
*NL*
made
a
rare
acquisition
.
''
Under
pretence
of
being
fatigued
,
Dantes
asked
*NL*
to
take
the
helm
;
the
steersman
,
glad
to
be
relieved
,
looked
at
the
*NL*
captain
,
and
the
latter
by
a
sign
indicated
that
he
might
abandon
it
to
*NL*
his
new
comrade
.
Dantes
could
thus
keep
his
eyes
on
Marseilles
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
day
of
the
month
?
''
asked
he
of
Jacopo
,
who
sat
down
beside
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
28th
of
February
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
what
year
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
what
year
--
you
ask
me
in
what
year
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
replied
the
young
man
,
``
I
ask
you
in
what
year
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
forgotten
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
got
such
a
fright
last
night
,
''
replied
Dantes
,
smiling
,
``
that
I
have
*NL*
almost
lost
my
memory
.
I
ask
you
what
year
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
year
1829
,
''
returned
Jacopo
.
It
was
fourteen
years
day
for
day
*NL*
since
Dantes
'
arrest
.
He
was
nineteen
when
he
entered
the
Chateau
d'If
;
*NL*
he
was
thirty-three
when
he
escaped
.
A
sorrowful
smile
passed
over
his
*NL*
face
;
he
asked
himself
what
had
become
of
Mercedes
,
who
must
believe
him
*NL*
dead
.
Then
his
eyes
lighted
up
with
hatred
as
he
thought
of
the
three
*NL*
men
who
had
caused
him
so
long
and
wretched
a
captivity
.
He
renewed
*NL*
against
Danglars
,
Fernand
,
and
Villefort
the
oath
of
implacable
*NL*
vengeance
he
had
made
in
his
dungeon
.
This
oath
was
no
longer
a
vain
*NL*
menace
;
for
the
fastest
sailer
in
the
Mediterranean
would
have
been
*NL*
unable
to
overtake
the
little
tartan
,
that
with
every
stitch
of
canvas
*NL*
set
was
flying
before
the
wind
to
Leghorn
.

The
Smugglers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dantes
had
not
been
a
day
on
board
before
he
had
a
very
clear
idea
of
*NL*
the
men
with
whom
his
lot
had
been
cast
.
Without
having
been
in
the
*NL*
school
of
the
Abbe
Faria
,
the
worthy
master
of
The
Young
Amelia
-LRB-
the
*NL*
name
of
the
Genoese
tartan
-RRB-
knew
a
smattering
of
all
the
tongues
spoken
*NL*
on
the
shores
of
that
large
lake
called
the
Mediterranean
,
from
the
*NL*
Arabic
to
the
Provencal
,
and
this
,
while
it
spared
him
interpreters
,
*NL*
persons
always
troublesome
and
frequently
indiscreet
,
gave
him
great
*NL*
facilities
of
communication
,
either
with
the
vessels
he
met
at
sea
,
*NL*
with
the
small
boats
sailing
along
the
coast
,
or
with
the
people
without
*NL*
name
,
country
,
or
occupation
,
who
are
always
seen
on
the
quays
of
*NL*
seaports
,
and
who
live
by
hidden
and
mysterious
means
which
we
must
*NL*
suppose
to
be
a
direct
gift
of
providence
,
as
they
have
no
visible
means
*NL*
of
support
.
It
is
fair
to
assume
that
Dantes
was
on
board
a
smuggler
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
first
the
captain
had
received
Dantes
on
board
with
a
certain
degree
*NL*
of
distrust
.
He
was
very
well
known
to
the
customs
officers
of
the
*NL*
coast
;
and
as
there
was
between
these
worthies
and
himself
a
perpetual
*NL*
battle
of
wits
,
he
had
at
first
thought
that
Dantes
might
be
an
emissary
*NL*
of
these
industrious
guardians
of
rights
and
duties
,
who
perhaps
*NL*
employed
this
ingenious
means
of
learning
some
of
the
secrets
of
his
*NL*
trade
.
But
the
skilful
manner
in
which
Dantes
had
handled
the
lugger
had
*NL*
entirely
reassured
him
;
and
then
,
when
he
saw
the
light
plume
of
smoke
*NL*
floating
above
the
bastion
of
the
Chateau
d'If
,
and
heard
the
distant
*NL*
report
,
he
was
instantly
struck
with
the
idea
that
he
had
on
board
his
*NL*
vessel
one
whose
coming
and
going
,
like
that
of
kings
,
was
accompanied
*NL*
with
salutes
of
artillery
.
This
made
him
less
uneasy
,
it
must
be
owned
,
*NL*
than
if
the
new-comer
had
proved
to
be
a
customs
officer
;
but
this
*NL*
supposition
also
disappeared
like
the
first
,
when
he
beheld
the
perfect
*NL*
tranquillity
of
his
recruit
.
*NL*
*NL*
Edmond
thus
had
the
advantage
of
knowing
what
the
owner
was
,
without
the
*NL*
owner
knowing
who
he
was
;
and
however
the
old
sailor
and
his
crew
tried
*NL*
to
``
pump
''
him
,
they
extracted
nothing
more
from
him
;
he
gave
accurate
*NL*
descriptions
of
Naples
and
Malta
,
which
he
knew
as
well
as
Marseilles
,
*NL*
and
held
stoutly
to
his
first
story
.
Thus
the
Genoese
,
subtle
as
he
*NL*
was
,
was
duped
by
Edmond
,
in
whose
favor
his
mild
demeanor
,
his
nautical
*NL*
skill
,
and
his
admirable
dissimulation
,
pleaded
.
Moreover
,
it
is
*NL*
possible
that
the
Genoese
was
one
of
those
shrewd
persons
who
know
*NL*
nothing
but
what
they
should
know
,
and
believe
nothing
but
what
they
*NL*
should
believe
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
state
of
mutual
understanding
,
they
reached
Leghorn
.
Here
*NL*
Edmond
was
to
undergo
another
trial
;
he
was
to
find
out
whether
he
could
*NL*
recognize
himself
,
as
he
had
not
seen
his
own
face
for
fourteen
years
.
*NL*
He
had
preserved
a
tolerably
good
remembrance
of
what
the
youth
had
*NL*
been
,
and
was
now
to
find
out
what
the
man
had
become
.
His
comrades
*NL*
believed
that
his
vow
was
fulfilled
.
As
he
had
twenty
times
touched
at
*NL*
Leghorn
,
he
remembered
a
barber
in
St.
Ferdinand
Street
;
he
went
there
*NL*
to
have
his
beard
and
hair
cut
.
The
barber
gazed
in
amazement
at
this
*NL*
man
with
the
long
,
thick
and
black
hair
and
beard
,
which
gave
his
head
*NL*
the
appearance
of
one
of
Titian
's
portraits
.
At
this
period
it
was
not
*NL*
the
fashion
to
wear
so
large
a
beard
and
hair
so
long
;
now
a
barber
*NL*
would
only
be
surprised
if
a
man
gifted
with
such
advantages
should
*NL*
consent
voluntarily
to
deprive
himself
of
them
.
The
Leghorn
barber
said
*NL*
nothing
and
went
to
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
operation
was
concluded
,
and
Edmond
felt
that
his
chin
was
*NL*
completely
smooth
,
and
his
hair
reduced
to
its
usual
length
,
he
asked
*NL*
for
a
hand-glass
.
He
was
now
,
as
we
have
said
,
three-and-thirty
years
*NL*
of
age
,
and
his
fourteen
years
'
imprisonment
had
produced
a
great
*NL*
transformation
in
his
appearance
.
Dantes
had
entered
the
Chateau
d'If
*NL*
with
the
round
,
open
,
smiling
face
of
a
young
and
happy
man
,
with
whom
*NL*
the
early
paths
of
life
have
been
smooth
,
and
who
anticipates
a
future
*NL*
corresponding
with
his
past
.
This
was
now
all
changed
.
The
oval
face
*NL*
was
lengthened
,
his
smiling
mouth
had
assumed
the
firm
and
marked
*NL*
lines
which
betoken
resolution
;
his
eyebrows
were
arched
beneath
a
brow
*NL*
furrowed
with
thought
;
his
eyes
were
full
of
melancholy
,
and
from
their
*NL*
depths
occasionally
sparkled
gloomy
fires
of
misanthropy
and
hatred
;
*NL*
his
complexion
,
so
long
kept
from
the
sun
,
had
now
that
pale
color
*NL*
which
produces
,
when
the
features
are
encircled
with
black
hair
,
the
*NL*
aristocratic
beauty
of
the
man
of
the
north
;
the
profound
learning
*NL*
he
had
acquired
had
besides
diffused
over
his
features
a
refined
*NL*
intellectual
expression
;
and
he
had
also
acquired
,
being
naturally
of
*NL*
a
goodly
stature
,
that
vigor
which
a
frame
possesses
which
has
so
long
*NL*
concentrated
all
its
force
within
itself
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
the
elegance
of
a
nervous
and
slight
form
had
succeeded
the
solidity
*NL*
of
a
rounded
and
muscular
figure
.
As
to
his
voice
,
prayers
,
sobs
,
and
*NL*
imprecations
had
changed
it
so
that
at
times
it
was
of
a
singularly
*NL*
penetrating
sweetness
,
and
at
others
rough
and
almost
hoarse
.
Moreover
,
*NL*
from
being
so
long
in
twilight
or
darkness
,
his
eyes
had
acquired
the
*NL*
faculty
of
distinguishing
objects
in
the
night
,
common
to
the
hyena
and
*NL*
the
wolf
.
Edmond
smiled
when
he
beheld
himself
:
it
was
impossible
that
*NL*
his
best
friend
--
if
,
indeed
,
he
had
any
friend
left
--
could
recognize
*NL*
him
;
he
could
not
recognize
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
master
of
The
Young
Amelia
,
who
was
very
desirous
of
retaining
*NL*
amongst
his
crew
a
man
of
Edmond
's
value
,
had
offered
to
advance
him
*NL*
funds
out
of
his
future
profits
,
which
Edmond
had
accepted
.
His
next
*NL*
care
on
leaving
the
barber
's
who
had
achieved
his
first
metamorphosis
*NL*
was
to
enter
a
shop
and
buy
a
complete
sailor
's
suit
--
a
garb
,
as
we
all
*NL*
know
,
very
simple
,
and
consisting
of
white
trousers
,
a
striped
shirt
,
*NL*
and
a
cap
.
It
was
in
this
costume
,
and
bringing
back
to
Jacopo
the
shirt
*NL*
and
trousers
he
had
lent
him
,
that
Edmond
reappeared
before
the
captain
*NL*
of
the
lugger
,
who
had
made
him
tell
his
story
over
and
over
again
*NL*
before
he
could
believe
him
,
or
recognize
in
the
neat
and
trim
sailor
*NL*
the
man
with
thick
and
matted
beard
,
hair
tangled
with
seaweed
,
and
body
*NL*
soaking
in
seabrine
,
whom
he
had
picked
up
naked
and
nearly
drowned
.
*NL*
Attracted
by
his
prepossessing
appearance
,
he
renewed
his
offers
of
an
*NL*
engagement
to
Dantes
;
but
Dantes
,
who
had
his
own
projects
,
would
not
*NL*
agree
for
a
longer
time
than
three
months
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Young
Amelia
had
a
very
active
crew
,
very
obedient
to
their
captain
,
*NL*
who
lost
as
little
time
as
possible
.
He
had
scarcely
been
a
week
at
*NL*
Leghorn
before
the
hold
of
his
vessel
was
filled
with
printed
muslins
,
*NL*
contraband
cottons
,
English
powder
,
and
tobacco
on
which
the
excise
had
*NL*
forgotten
to
put
its
mark
.
The
master
was
to
get
all
this
out
of
Leghorn
*NL*
free
of
duties
,
and
land
it
on
the
shores
of
Corsica
,
where
certain
*NL*
speculators
undertook
to
forward
the
cargo
to
France
.
They
sailed
;
*NL*
Edmond
was
again
cleaving
the
azure
sea
which
had
been
the
first
horizon
*NL*
of
his
youth
,
and
which
he
had
so
often
dreamed
of
in
prison
.
He
left
*NL*
Gorgone
on
his
right
and
La
Pianosa
on
his
left
,
and
went
towards
the
*NL*
country
of
Paoli
and
Napoleon
.
The
next
morning
going
on
deck
,
as
he
*NL*
always
did
at
an
early
hour
,
the
patron
found
Dantes
leaning
against
*NL*
the
bulwarks
gazing
with
intense
earnestness
at
a
pile
of
granite
rocks
,
*NL*
which
the
rising
sun
tinged
with
rosy
light
.
It
was
the
Island
of
Monte
*NL*
Cristo
.
The
Young
Amelia
left
it
three-quarters
of
a
league
to
the
*NL*
larboard
,
and
kept
on
for
Corsica
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dantes
thought
,
as
they
passed
so
closely
to
the
island
whose
name
was
*NL*
so
interesting
to
him
,
that
he
had
only
to
leap
into
the
sea
and
in
*NL*
half
an
hour
be
at
the
promised
land
.
But
then
what
could
he
do
without
*NL*
instruments
to
discover
his
treasure
,
without
arms
to
defend
himself
?
*NL*
Besides
,
what
would
the
sailors
say
?
What
would
the
patron
think
?
He
*NL*
must
wait
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fortunately
,
Dantes
had
learned
how
to
wait
;
he
had
waited
fourteen
*NL*
years
for
his
liberty
,
and
now
he
was
free
he
could
wait
at
least
six
*NL*
months
or
a
year
for
wealth
.
Would
he
not
have
accepted
liberty
without
*NL*
riches
if
it
had
been
offered
to
him
?
Besides
,
were
not
those
riches
*NL*
chimerical
?
--
offspring
of
the
brain
of
the
poor
Abbe
Faria
,
had
they
*NL*
not
died
with
him
?
It
is
true
,
the
letter
of
the
Cardinal
Spada
was
*NL*
singularly
circumstantial
,
and
Dantes
repeated
it
to
himself
,
from
one
*NL*
end
to
the
other
,
for
he
had
not
forgotten
a
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
Evening
came
,
and
Edmond
saw
the
island
tinged
with
the
shades
of
*NL*
twilight
,
and
then
disappear
in
the
darkness
from
all
eyes
but
his
own
,
*NL*
for
he
,
with
vision
accustomed
to
the
gloom
of
a
prison
,
continued
to
*NL*
behold
it
last
of
all
,
for
he
remained
alone
upon
deck
.
The
next
morn
*NL*
broke
off
the
coast
of
Aleria
;
all
day
they
coasted
,
and
in
the
evening
*NL*
saw
fires
lighted
on
land
;
the
position
of
these
was
no
doubt
a
signal
*NL*
for
landing
,
for
a
ship
's
lantern
was
hung
up
at
the
mast-head
instead
*NL*
of
the
streamer
,
and
they
came
to
within
a
gunshot
of
the
shore
.
Dantes
*NL*
noticed
that
the
captain
of
The
Young
Amelia
had
,
as
he
neared
the
land
,
*NL*
mounted
two
small
culverins
,
which
,
without
making
much
noise
,
can
throw
*NL*
a
four
ounce
ball
a
thousand
paces
or
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
on
this
occasion
the
precaution
was
superfluous
,
and
everything
*NL*
proceeded
with
the
utmost
smoothness
and
politeness
.
Four
shallops
came
*NL*
off
with
very
little
noise
alongside
the
lugger
,
which
,
no
doubt
,
in
*NL*
acknowledgement
of
the
compliment
,
lowered
her
own
shallop
into
the
sea
,
*NL*
and
the
five
boats
worked
so
well
that
by
two
o'clock
in
the
morning
*NL*
all
the
cargo
was
out
of
The
Young
Amelia
and
on
terra
firma
.
The
same
*NL*
night
,
such
a
man
of
regularity
was
the
patron
of
The
Young
Amelia
,
the
*NL*
profits
were
divided
,
and
each
man
had
a
hundred
Tuscan
livres
,
or
about
*NL*
eighty
francs
.
But
the
voyage
was
not
ended
.
They
turned
the
bowsprit
*NL*
towards
Sardinia
,
where
they
intended
to
take
in
a
cargo
,
which
was
to
*NL*
replace
what
had
been
discharged
.
The
second
operation
was
as
successful
*NL*
as
the
first
,
The
Young
Amelia
was
in
luck
.
This
new
cargo
was
destined
*NL*
for
the
coast
of
the
Duchy
of
Lucca
,
and
consisted
almost
entirely
of
*NL*
Havana
cigars
,
sherry
,
and
Malaga
wines
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
they
had
a
bit
of
a
skirmish
in
getting
rid
of
the
duties
;
the
*NL*
excise
was
,
in
truth
,
the
everlasting
enemy
of
the
patron
of
The
Young
*NL*
Amelia
.
A
customs
officer
was
laid
low
,
and
two
sailors
wounded
;
Dantes
*NL*
was
one
of
the
latter
,
a
ball
having
touched
him
in
the
left
shoulder
.
*NL*
Dantes
was
almost
glad
of
this
affray
,
and
almost
pleased
at
being
*NL*
wounded
,
for
they
were
rude
lessons
which
taught
him
with
what
eye
he
*NL*
could
view
danger
,
and
with
what
endurance
he
could
bear
suffering
.
He
*NL*
had
contemplated
danger
with
a
smile
,
and
when
wounded
had
exclaimed
*NL*
with
the
great
philosopher
,
``
Pain
,
thou
art
not
an
evil
.
''
He
had
,
*NL*
moreover
,
looked
upon
the
customs
officer
wounded
to
death
,
and
,
whether
*NL*
from
heat
of
blood
produced
by
the
encounter
,
or
the
chill
of
human
*NL*
sentiment
,
this
sight
had
made
but
slight
impression
upon
him
.
Dantes
*NL*
was
on
the
way
he
desired
to
follow
,
and
was
moving
towards
the
end
*NL*
he
wished
to
achieve
;
his
heart
was
in
a
fair
way
of
petrifying
in
his
*NL*
bosom
.
Jacopo
,
seeing
him
fall
,
had
believed
him
killed
,
and
rushing
*NL*
towards
him
raised
him
up
,
and
then
attended
to
him
with
all
the
*NL*
kindness
of
a
devoted
comrade
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
world
was
not
then
so
good
as
Doctor
Pangloss
believed
it
,
neither
*NL*
was
it
so
wicked
as
Dantes
thought
it
,
since
this
man
,
who
had
nothing
*NL*
to
expect
from
his
comrade
but
the
inheritance
of
his
share
of
*NL*
the
prize-money
,
manifested
so
much
sorrow
when
he
saw
him
fall
.
*NL*
Fortunately
,
as
we
have
said
,
Edmond
was
only
wounded
,
and
with
certain
*NL*
herbs
gathered
at
certain
seasons
,
and
sold
to
the
smugglers
by
the
*NL*
old
Sardinian
women
,
the
wound
soon
closed
.
Edmond
then
resolved
to
*NL*
try
Jacopo
,
and
offered
him
in
return
for
his
attention
a
share
of
his
*NL*
prize-money
,
but
Jacopo
refused
it
indignantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
a
result
of
the
sympathetic
devotion
which
Jacopo
had
from
the
*NL*
first
bestowed
on
Edmond
,
the
latter
was
moved
to
a
certain
degree
of
*NL*
affection
.
But
this
sufficed
for
Jacopo
,
who
instinctively
felt
that
*NL*
Edmond
had
a
right
to
superiority
of
position
--
a
superiority
which
*NL*
Edmond
had
concealed
from
all
others
.
And
from
this
time
the
kindness
*NL*
which
Edmond
showed
him
was
enough
for
the
brave
seaman
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
in
the
long
days
on
board
ship
,
when
the
vessel
,
gliding
on
with
*NL*
security
over
the
azure
sea
,
required
no
care
but
the
hand
of
the
*NL*
helmsman
,
thanks
to
the
favorable
winds
that
swelled
her
sails
,
Edmond
,
*NL*
with
a
chart
in
his
hand
,
became
the
instructor
of
Jacopo
,
as
the
poor
*NL*
Abbe
Faria
had
been
his
tutor
.
He
pointed
out
to
him
the
bearings
of
the
*NL*
coast
,
explained
to
him
the
variations
of
the
compass
,
and
taught
him
to
*NL*
read
in
that
vast
book
opened
over
our
heads
which
they
call
heaven
,
*NL*
and
where
God
writes
in
azure
with
letters
of
diamonds
.
And
when
Jacopo
*NL*
inquired
of
him
,
``
What
is
the
use
of
teaching
all
these
things
to
a
*NL*
poor
sailor
like
me
?
''
Edmond
replied
,
``
Who
knows
?
You
may
one
day
be
the
*NL*
captain
of
a
vessel
.
Your
fellow-countryman
,
Bonaparte
,
became
emperor
.
''
*NL*
We
had
forgotten
to
say
that
Jacopo
was
a
Corsican
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
months
and
a
half
elapsed
in
these
trips
,
and
Edmond
had
become
*NL*
as
skilful
a
coaster
as
he
had
been
a
hardy
seaman
;
he
had
formed
an
*NL*
acquaintance
with
all
the
smugglers
on
the
coast
,
and
learned
all
the
*NL*
Masonic
signs
by
which
these
half
pirates
recognize
each
other
.
He
had
*NL*
passed
and
re-passed
his
Island
of
Monte
Cristo
twenty
times
,
but
not
*NL*
once
had
he
found
an
opportunity
of
landing
there
.
He
then
formed
a
*NL*
resolution
.
As
soon
as
his
engagement
with
the
patron
of
The
Young
*NL*
Amelia
ended
,
he
would
hire
a
small
vessel
on
his
own
account
--
for
in
*NL*
his
several
voyages
he
had
amassed
a
hundred
piastres
--
and
under
some
*NL*
pretext
land
at
the
Island
of
Monte
Cristo
.
Then
he
would
be
free
to
*NL*
make
his
researches
,
not
perhaps
entirely
at
liberty
,
for
he
would
be
*NL*
doubtless
watched
by
those
who
accompanied
him
.
But
in
this
world
we
*NL*
must
risk
something
.
Prison
had
made
Edmond
prudent
,
and
he
was
desirous
*NL*
of
running
no
risk
whatever
.
But
in
vain
did
he
rack
his
imagination
;
*NL*
fertile
as
it
was
,
he
could
not
devise
any
plan
for
reaching
the
island
*NL*
without
companionship
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dantes
was
tossed
about
on
these
doubts
and
wishes
,
when
the
patron
,
who
*NL*
had
great
confidence
in
him
,
and
was
very
desirous
of
retaining
him
in
*NL*
his
service
,
took
him
by
the
arm
one
evening
and
led
him
to
a
tavern
*NL*
on
the
Via
del
'
Oglio
,
where
the
leading
smugglers
of
Leghorn
used
*NL*
to
congregate
and
discuss
affairs
connected
with
their
trade
.
Already
*NL*
Dantes
had
visited
this
maritime
Bourse
two
or
three
times
,
and
seeing
*NL*
all
these
hardy
free-traders
,
who
supplied
the
whole
coast
for
nearly
*NL*
two
hundred
leagues
in
extent
,
he
had
asked
himself
what
power
might
*NL*
not
that
man
attain
who
should
give
the
impulse
of
his
will
to
all
these
*NL*
contrary
and
diverging
minds
.
This
time
it
was
a
great
matter
that
was
*NL*
under
discussion
,
connected
with
a
vessel
laden
with
Turkey
carpets
,
*NL*
stuffs
of
the
Levant
,
and
cashmeres
.
It
was
necessary
to
find
some
*NL*
neutral
ground
on
which
an
exchange
could
be
made
,
and
then
to
try
and
*NL*
land
these
goods
on
the
coast
of
France
.
If
the
venture
was
successful
*NL*
the
profit
would
be
enormous
,
there
would
be
a
gain
of
fifty
or
sixty
*NL*
piastres
each
for
the
crew
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
patron
of
The
Young
Amelia
proposed
as
a
place
of
landing
the
Island
*NL*
of
Monte
Cristo
,
which
being
completely
deserted
,
and
having
neither
*NL*
soldiers
nor
revenue
officers
,
seemed
to
have
been
placed
in
the
midst
*NL*
of
the
ocean
since
the
time
of
the
heathen
Olympus
by
Mercury
,
the
god
*NL*
of
merchants
and
robbers
,
classes
of
mankind
which
we
in
modern
times
*NL*
have
separated
if
not
made
distinct
,
but
which
antiquity
appears
to
have
*NL*
included
in
the
same
category
.
At
the
mention
of
Monte
Cristo
Dantes
*NL*
started
with
joy
;
he
rose
to
conceal
his
emotion
,
and
took
a
turn
*NL*
around
the
smoky
tavern
,
where
all
the
languages
of
the
known
world
were
*NL*
jumbled
in
a
lingua
franca
.
When
he
again
joined
the
two
persons
who
had
*NL*
been
discussing
the
matter
,
it
had
been
decided
that
they
should
touch
*NL*
at
Monte
Cristo
and
set
out
on
the
following
night
.
Edmond
,
being
*NL*
consulted
,
was
of
opinion
that
the
island
afforded
every
possible
*NL*
security
,
and
that
great
enterprises
to
be
well
done
should
be
done
*NL*
quickly
.
Nothing
then
was
altered
in
the
plan
,
and
orders
were
given
to
*NL*
get
under
weigh
next
night
,
and
,
wind
and
weather
permitting
,
to
make
*NL*
the
neutral
island
by
the
following
day
.

Chapter
23
.
The
Island
of
Monte
Cristo
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
,
at
length
,
by
one
of
the
unexpected
strokes
of
fortune
which
*NL*
sometimes
befall
those
who
have
for
a
long
time
been
the
victims
of
an
*NL*
evil
destiny
,
Dantes
was
about
to
secure
the
opportunity
he
wished
for
,
*NL*
by
simple
and
natural
means
,
and
land
on
the
island
without
incurring
*NL*
any
suspicion
.
One
night
more
and
he
would
be
on
his
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
night
was
one
of
feverish
distraction
,
and
in
its
progress
visions
*NL*
good
and
evil
passed
through
Dantes
'
mind
.
If
he
closed
his
eyes
,
he
saw
*NL*
Cardinal
Spada
's
letter
written
on
the
wall
in
characters
of
flame
--
if
*NL*
he
slept
for
a
moment
the
wildest
dreams
haunted
his
brain
.
He
ascended
*NL*
into
grottos
paved
with
emeralds
,
with
panels
of
rubies
,
and
the
*NL*
roof
glowing
with
diamond
stalactites
.
Pearls
fell
drop
by
drop
,
as
*NL*
subterranean
waters
filter
in
their
caves
.
Edmond
,
amazed
,
wonderstruck
,
*NL*
filled
his
pockets
with
the
radiant
gems
and
then
returned
to
daylight
,
*NL*
when
he
discovered
that
his
prizes
had
all
changed
into
common
pebbles
.
*NL*
He
then
endeavored
to
re-enter
the
marvellous
grottos
,
but
they
had
*NL*
suddenly
receded
,
and
now
the
path
became
a
labyrinth
,
and
then
the
*NL*
entrance
vanished
,
and
in
vain
did
he
tax
his
memory
for
the
magic
and
*NL*
mysterious
word
which
opened
the
splendid
caverns
of
Ali
Baba
to
the
*NL*
Arabian
fisherman
.
All
was
useless
,
the
treasure
disappeared
,
and
had
*NL*
again
reverted
to
the
genii
from
whom
for
a
moment
he
had
hoped
to
carry
*NL*
it
off
.
The
day
came
at
length
,
and
was
almost
as
feverish
as
the
night
*NL*
had
been
,
but
it
brought
reason
to
the
aid
of
imagination
,
and
Dantes
*NL*
was
then
enabled
to
arrange
a
plan
which
had
hitherto
been
vague
and
*NL*
unsettled
in
his
brain
.
Night
came
,
and
with
it
the
preparation
for
*NL*
departure
,
and
these
preparations
served
to
conceal
Dantes
'
agitation
.
*NL*
He
had
by
degrees
assumed
such
authority
over
his
companions
that
he
was
*NL*
almost
like
a
commander
on
board
;
and
as
his
orders
were
always
clear
,
*NL*
distinct
,
and
easy
of
execution
,
his
comrades
obeyed
him
with
celerity
*NL*
and
pleasure
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
patron
did
not
interfere
,
for
he
too
had
recognized
the
*NL*
superiority
of
Dantes
over
the
crew
and
himself
.
He
saw
in
the
young
man
*NL*
his
natural
successor
,
and
regretted
that
he
had
not
a
daughter
,
that
*NL*
he
might
have
bound
Edmond
to
him
by
a
more
secure
alliance
.
At
seven
*NL*
o'clock
in
the
evening
all
was
ready
,
and
at
ten
minutes
past
seven
they
*NL*
doubled
the
lighthouse
just
as
the
beacon
was
kindled
.
The
sea
was
calm
,
*NL*
and
,
with
a
fresh
breeze
from
the
south-east
,
they
sailed
beneath
a
*NL*
bright
blue
sky
,
in
which
God
also
lighted
up
in
turn
his
beacon
lights
,
*NL*
each
of
which
is
a
world
.
Dantes
told
them
that
all
hands
might
turn
in
,
*NL*
and
he
would
take
the
helm
.
When
the
Maltese
-LRB-
for
so
they
called
*NL*
Dantes
-RRB-
had
said
this
,
it
was
sufficient
,
and
all
went
to
their
bunks
*NL*
contentedly
.
This
frequently
happened
.
Dantes
,
cast
from
solitude
into
*NL*
the
world
,
frequently
experienced
an
imperious
desire
for
solitude
;
and
*NL*
what
solitude
is
more
complete
,
or
more
poetical
,
than
that
of
a
ship
*NL*
floating
in
isolation
on
the
sea
during
the
obscurity
of
the
night
,
in
*NL*
the
silence
of
immensity
,
and
under
the
eye
of
heaven
?
*NL*
*NL*
Now
this
solitude
was
peopled
with
his
thoughts
,
the
night
lighted
up
by
*NL*
his
illusions
,
and
the
silence
animated
by
his
anticipations
.
When
the
*NL*
patron
awoke
,
the
vessel
was
hurrying
on
with
every
sail
set
,
and
every
*NL*
sail
full
with
the
breeze
.
They
were
making
nearly
ten
knots
an
hour
.
*NL*
The
Island
of
Monte
Cristo
loomed
large
in
the
horizon
.
Edmond
resigned
*NL*
the
lugger
to
the
master
's
care
,
and
went
and
lay
down
in
his
hammock
;
*NL*
but
,
in
spite
of
a
sleepless
night
,
he
could
not
close
his
eyes
for
a
*NL*
moment
.
Two
hours
afterwards
he
came
on
deck
,
as
the
boat
was
about
*NL*
to
double
the
Island
of
Elba
.
They
were
just
abreast
of
Mareciana
,
and
*NL*
beyond
the
flat
but
verdant
Island
of
La
Pianosa
.
The
peak
of
Monte
*NL*
Cristo
reddened
by
the
burning
sun
,
was
seen
against
the
azure
sky
.
*NL*
Dantes
ordered
the
helmsman
to
put
down
his
helm
,
in
order
to
leave
La
*NL*
Pianosa
to
starboard
,
as
he
knew
that
he
should
shorten
his
course
by
*NL*
two
or
three
knots
.
About
five
o'clock
in
the
evening
the
island
was
*NL*
distinct
,
and
everything
on
it
was
plainly
perceptible
,
owing
to
that
*NL*
clearness
of
the
atmosphere
peculiar
to
the
light
which
the
rays
of
the
*NL*
sun
cast
at
its
setting
.
*NL*
*NL*
Edmond
gazed
very
earnestly
at
the
mass
of
rocks
which
gave
out
all
the
*NL*
variety
of
twilight
colors
,
from
the
brightest
pink
to
the
deepest
blue
;
*NL*
and
from
time
to
time
his
cheeks
flushed
,
his
brow
darkened
,
and
a
mist
*NL*
passed
over
his
eyes
.
Never
did
a
gamester
,
whose
whole
fortune
is
staked
*NL*
on
one
cast
of
the
die
,
experience
the
anguish
which
Edmond
felt
in
his
*NL*
paroxysms
of
hope
.
Night
came
,
and
at
ten
o'clock
they
anchored
.
The
*NL*
Young
Amelia
was
first
at
the
rendezvous
.
In
spite
of
his
usual
command
*NL*
over
himself
,
Dantes
could
not
restrain
his
impetuosity
.
He
was
the
*NL*
first
to
jump
on
shore
;
and
had
he
dared
,
he
would
,
like
Lucius
Brutus
,
*NL*
have
``
kissed
his
mother
earth
.
''
It
was
dark
,
but
at
eleven
o'clock
the
*NL*
moon
rose
in
the
midst
of
the
ocean
,
whose
every
wave
she
silvered
,
*NL*
and
then
,
``
ascending
high
,
''
played
in
floods
of
pale
light
on
the
rocky
*NL*
hills
of
this
second
Pelion
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
island
was
familiar
to
the
crew
of
The
Young
Amelia
,
--
it
was
one
of
*NL*
her
regular
haunts
.
As
to
Dantes
,
he
had
passed
it
on
his
voyage
to
and
*NL*
from
the
Levant
,
but
never
touched
at
it
.
He
questioned
Jacopo
.
``
Where
*NL*
shall
we
pass
the
night
?
''
he
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
on
board
the
tartan
,
''
replied
the
sailor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Should
we
not
do
better
in
the
grottos
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
grottos
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
the
grottos
--
caves
of
the
island
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
know
of
any
grottos
,
''
replied
Jacopo
.
The
cold
sweat
sprang
*NL*
forth
on
Dantes
'
brow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
are
there
no
grottos
at
Monte
Cristo
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
None
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
moment
Dantes
was
speechless
;
then
he
remembered
that
these
caves
*NL*
might
have
been
filled
up
by
some
accident
,
or
even
stopped
up
,
for
the
*NL*
sake
of
greater
security
,
by
Cardinal
Spada
.
The
point
was
,
then
,
to
*NL*
discover
the
hidden
entrance
.
It
was
useless
to
search
at
night
,
and
*NL*
Dantes
therefore
delayed
all
investigation
until
the
morning
.
Besides
,
*NL*
a
signal
made
half
a
league
out
at
sea
,
and
to
which
The
Young
Amelia
*NL*
replied
by
a
similar
signal
,
indicated
that
the
moment
for
business
had
*NL*
come
.
The
boat
that
now
arrived
,
assured
by
the
answering
signal
that
*NL*
all
was
well
,
soon
came
in
sight
,
white
and
silent
as
a
phantom
,
and
*NL*
cast
anchor
within
a
cable
's
length
of
shore
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
the
landing
began
.
Dantes
reflected
,
as
he
worked
,
on
the
shout
of
*NL*
joy
which
,
with
a
single
word
,
he
could
evoke
from
all
these
men
,
if
he
*NL*
gave
utterance
to
the
one
unchanging
thought
that
pervaded
his
heart
;
*NL*
but
,
far
from
disclosing
this
precious
secret
,
he
almost
feared
that
*NL*
he
had
already
said
too
much
,
and
by
his
restlessness
and
continual
*NL*
questions
,
his
minute
observations
and
evident
pre-occupation
,
aroused
*NL*
suspicions
.
Fortunately
,
as
regarded
this
circumstance
at
least
,
his
*NL*
painful
past
gave
to
his
countenance
an
indelible
sadness
,
and
*NL*
the
glimmerings
of
gayety
seen
beneath
this
cloud
were
indeed
but
*NL*
transitory
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
one
had
the
slightest
suspicion
;
and
when
next
day
,
taking
a
*NL*
fowling-piece
,
powder
,
and
shot
,
Dantes
declared
his
intention
to
go
and
*NL*
kill
some
of
the
wild
goats
that
were
seen
springing
from
rock
to
rock
,
*NL*
his
wish
was
construed
into
a
love
of
sport
,
or
a
desire
for
solitude
.
*NL*
However
,
Jacopo
insisted
on
following
him
,
and
Dantes
did
not
oppose
*NL*
this
,
fearing
if
he
did
so
that
he
might
incur
distrust
.
Scarcely
,
*NL*
however
,
had
they
gone
a
quarter
of
a
league
when
,
having
killed
a
kid
,
*NL*
he
begged
Jacopo
to
take
it
to
his
comrades
,
and
request
them
to
cook
*NL*
it
,
and
when
ready
to
let
him
know
by
firing
a
gun
.
This
and
some
dried
*NL*
fruits
and
a
flask
of
Monte
Pulciano
,
was
the
bill
of
fare
.
Dantes
*NL*
went
on
,
looking
from
time
to
time
behind
and
around
about
him
.
Having
*NL*
reached
the
summit
of
a
rock
,
he
saw
,
a
thousand
feet
beneath
him
,
his
*NL*
companions
,
whom
Jacopo
had
rejoined
,
and
who
were
all
busy
preparing
*NL*
the
repast
which
Edmond
's
skill
as
a
marksman
had
augmented
with
a
*NL*
capital
dish
.
*NL*
*NL*
Edmond
looked
at
them
for
a
moment
with
the
sad
and
gentle
smile
of
*NL*
a
man
superior
to
his
fellows
.
``
In
two
hours
'
time
,
''
said
he
,
``
these
*NL*
persons
will
depart
richer
by
fifty
piastres
each
,
to
go
and
risk
their
*NL*
lives
again
by
endeavoring
to
gain
fifty
more
;
then
they
will
return
*NL*
with
a
fortune
of
six
hundred
francs
,
and
waste
this
treasure
in
some
*NL*
city
with
the
pride
of
sultans
and
the
insolence
of
nabobs
.
At
*NL*
this
moment
hope
makes
me
despise
their
riches
,
which
seem
to
me
*NL*
contemptible
.
Yet
perchance
to-morrow
deception
will
so
act
on
me
,
that
*NL*
I
shall
,
on
compulsion
,
consider
such
a
contemptible
possession
as
the
*NL*
utmost
happiness
.
Oh
,
no
!
''
exclaimed
Edmond
,
``
that
will
not
be
.
The
*NL*
wise
,
unerring
Faria
could
not
be
mistaken
in
this
one
thing
.
Besides
,
*NL*
it
were
better
to
die
than
to
continue
to
lead
this
low
and
wretched
*NL*
life
.
''
Thus
Dantes
,
who
but
three
months
before
had
no
desire
but
*NL*
liberty
had
now
not
liberty
enough
,
and
panted
for
wealth
.
The
cause
was
*NL*
not
in
Dantes
,
but
in
providence
,
who
,
while
limiting
the
power
of
man
,
*NL*
has
filled
him
with
boundless
desires
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
by
a
cleft
between
two
walls
of
rock
,
following
a
path
worn
*NL*
by
a
torrent
,
and
which
,
in
all
human
probability
,
human
foot
had
never
*NL*
before
trod
,
Dantes
approached
the
spot
where
he
supposed
the
grottos
*NL*
must
have
existed
.
Keeping
along
the
shore
,
and
examining
the
smallest
*NL*
object
with
serious
attention
,
he
thought
he
could
trace
,
on
certain
*NL*
rocks
,
marks
made
by
the
hand
of
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
Time
,
which
encrusts
all
physical
substances
with
its
mossy
mantle
,
as
*NL*
it
invests
all
things
of
the
mind
with
forgetfulness
,
seemed
to
have
*NL*
respected
these
signs
,
which
apparently
had
been
made
with
some
degree
*NL*
of
regularity
,
and
probably
with
a
definite
purpose
.
Occasionally
the
*NL*
marks
were
hidden
under
tufts
of
myrtle
,
which
spread
into
large
bushes
*NL*
laden
with
blossoms
,
or
beneath
parasitical
lichen
.
So
Edmond
had
*NL*
to
separate
the
branches
or
brush
away
the
moss
to
know
where
the
*NL*
guide-marks
were
.
The
sight
of
marks
renewed
Edmond
fondest
hopes
.
Might
*NL*
it
not
have
been
the
cardinal
himself
who
had
first
traced
them
,
in
*NL*
order
that
they
might
serve
as
a
guide
for
his
nephew
in
the
event
of
*NL*
a
catastrophe
,
which
he
could
not
foresee
would
have
been
so
complete
.
*NL*
This
solitary
place
was
precisely
suited
to
the
requirements
of
a
man
*NL*
desirous
of
burying
treasure
.
Only
,
might
not
these
betraying
marks
have
*NL*
attracted
other
eyes
than
those
for
whom
they
were
made
?
and
had
the
*NL*
dark
and
wondrous
island
indeed
faithfully
guarded
its
precious
secret
?
*NL*
*NL*
It
seemed
,
however
,
to
Edmond
,
who
was
hidden
from
his
comrades
by
the
*NL*
inequalities
of
the
ground
,
that
at
sixty
paces
from
the
harbor
the
*NL*
marks
ceased
;
nor
did
they
terminate
at
any
grotto
.
A
large
round
rock
,
*NL*
placed
solidly
on
its
base
,
was
the
only
spot
to
which
they
seemed
to
*NL*
lead
.
Edmond
concluded
that
perhaps
instead
of
having
reached
the
end
*NL*
of
the
route
he
had
only
explored
its
beginning
,
and
he
therefore
turned
*NL*
round
and
retraced
his
steps
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
his
comrades
had
prepared
the
repast
,
had
got
some
water
from
*NL*
a
spring
,
spread
out
the
fruit
and
bread
,
and
cooked
the
kid
.
Just
at
*NL*
the
moment
when
they
were
taking
the
dainty
animal
from
the
spit
,
they
*NL*
saw
Edmond
springing
with
the
boldness
of
a
chamois
from
rock
to
rock
,
*NL*
and
they
fired
the
signal
agreed
upon
.
The
sportsman
instantly
changed
*NL*
his
direction
,
and
ran
quickly
towards
them
.
But
even
while
they
watched
*NL*
his
daring
progress
,
Edmond
's
foot
slipped
,
and
they
saw
him
stagger
on
*NL*
the
edge
of
a
rock
and
disappear
.
They
all
rushed
towards
him
,
for
all
*NL*
loved
Edmond
in
spite
of
his
superiority
;
yet
Jacopo
reached
him
first
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
found
Edmond
lying
prone
,
bleeding
,
and
almost
senseless
.
He
had
*NL*
rolled
down
a
declivity
of
twelve
or
fifteen
feet
.
They
poured
a
little
*NL*
rum
down
his
throat
,
and
this
remedy
which
had
before
been
so
beneficial
*NL*
to
him
,
produced
the
same
effect
as
formerly
.
Edmond
opened
his
eyes
,
*NL*
complained
of
great
pain
in
his
knee
,
a
feeling
of
heaviness
in
his
*NL*
head
,
and
severe
pains
in
his
loins
.
They
wished
to
carry
him
to
the
*NL*
shore
;
but
when
they
touched
him
,
although
under
Jacopo
's
directions
,
he
*NL*
declared
,
with
heavy
groans
,
that
he
could
not
bear
to
be
moved
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
may
be
supposed
that
Dantes
did
not
now
think
of
his
dinner
,
but
he
*NL*
insisted
that
his
comrades
,
who
had
not
his
reasons
for
fasting
,
should
*NL*
have
their
meal
.
As
for
himself
,
he
declared
that
he
had
only
need
of
*NL*
a
little
rest
,
and
that
when
they
returned
he
should
be
easier
.
The
*NL*
sailors
did
not
require
much
urging
.
They
were
hungry
,
and
the
smell
of
*NL*
the
roasted
kid
was
very
savory
,
and
your
tars
are
not
very
ceremonious
.
*NL*
An
hour
afterwards
they
returned
.
All
that
Edmond
had
been
able
to
*NL*
do
was
to
drag
himself
about
a
dozen
paces
forward
to
lean
against
a
*NL*
moss-grown
rock
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
instead
of
growing
easier
,
Dantes
'
pains
appeared
to
increase
in
*NL*
violence
.
The
old
patron
,
who
was
obliged
to
sail
in
the
morning
in
*NL*
order
to
land
his
cargo
on
the
frontiers
of
Piedmont
and
France
,
*NL*
between
Nice
and
Frejus
,
urged
Dantes
to
try
and
rise
.
Edmond
made
great
*NL*
exertions
in
order
to
comply
;
but
at
each
effort
he
fell
back
,
moaning
*NL*
and
turning
pale
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
broken
his
ribs
,
''
said
the
commander
,
in
a
low
voice
.
``
No
*NL*
matter
;
he
is
an
excellent
fellow
,
and
we
must
not
leave
him
.
We
will
*NL*
try
and
carry
him
on
board
the
tartan
.
''
Dantes
declared
,
however
,
*NL*
that
he
would
rather
die
where
he
was
than
undergo
the
agony
which
the
*NL*
slightest
movement
cost
him
.
``
Well
,
''
said
the
patron
,
``
let
what
may
*NL*
happen
,
it
shall
never
be
said
that
we
deserted
a
good
comrade
like
you
.
*NL*
We
will
not
go
till
evening
.
''
This
very
much
astonished
the
sailors
,
*NL*
although
,
not
one
opposed
it
.
The
patron
was
so
strict
that
this
was
the
*NL*
first
time
they
had
ever
seen
him
give
up
an
enterprise
,
or
even
delay
*NL*
in
its
execution
.
Dantes
would
not
allow
that
any
such
infraction
of
*NL*
regular
and
proper
rules
should
be
made
in
his
favor
.
``
No
,
no
,
''
he
said
*NL*
to
the
patron
,
``
I
was
awkward
,
and
it
is
just
that
I
pay
the
penalty
of
*NL*
my
clumsiness
.
Leave
me
a
small
supply
of
biscuit
,
a
gun
,
powder
,
and
*NL*
balls
,
to
kill
the
kids
or
defend
myself
at
need
,
and
a
pickaxe
,
that
I
*NL*
may
build
a
shelter
if
you
delay
in
coming
back
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
'll
die
of
hunger
,
''
said
the
patron
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
rather
do
so
,
''
was
Edmond
reply
,
``
than
suffer
the
inexpressible
*NL*
agonies
which
the
slightest
movement
causes
me
.
''
The
patron
turned
*NL*
towards
his
vessel
,
which
was
rolling
on
the
swell
in
the
little
harbor
,
*NL*
and
,
with
sails
partly
set
,
would
be
ready
for
sea
when
her
toilet
*NL*
should
be
completed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
we
to
do
,
Maltese
?
''
asked
the
captain
.
``
We
can
not
leave
you
*NL*
here
so
,
and
yet
we
can
not
stay
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
,
go
!
''
exclaimed
Dantes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
shall
be
absent
at
least
a
week
,
''
said
the
patron
,
``
and
then
we
must
*NL*
run
out
of
our
course
to
come
here
and
take
you
up
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
''
said
Dantes
,
``
if
in
two
or
three
days
you
hail
any
fishing-boat
,
*NL*
desire
them
to
come
here
to
me
.
I
will
pay
twenty-five
piastres
for
my
*NL*
passage
back
to
Leghorn
.
If
you
do
not
come
across
one
,
return
for
me
.
''
*NL*
The
patron
shook
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
,
Captain
Baldi
;
there
's
one
way
of
settling
this
,
''
said
Jacopo
.
*NL*
``
Do
you
go
,
and
I
will
stay
and
take
care
of
the
wounded
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
give
up
your
share
of
the
venture
,
''
said
Edmond
,
``
to
remain
with
*NL*
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Jacopo
,
``
and
without
any
hesitation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
a
good
fellow
and
a
kind-hearted
messmate
,
''
replied
Edmond
,
*NL*
``
and
heaven
will
recompense
you
for
your
generous
intentions
;
but
I
do
*NL*
not
wish
any
one
to
stay
with
me
.
A
day
or
two
of
rest
will
set
me
up
,
*NL*
and
I
hope
I
shall
find
among
the
rocks
certain
herbs
most
excellent
for
*NL*
bruises
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
peculiar
smile
passed
over
Dantes
'
lips
;
he
squeezed
Jacopo
's
hand
*NL*
warmly
,
but
nothing
could
shake
his
determination
to
remain
--
and
remain
*NL*
alone
.
The
smugglers
left
with
Edmond
what
he
had
requested
and
set
*NL*
sail
,
but
not
without
turning
about
several
times
,
and
each
time
making
*NL*
signs
of
a
cordial
farewell
,
to
which
Edmond
replied
with
his
hand
*NL*
only
,
as
if
he
could
not
move
the
rest
of
his
body
.
Then
,
when
they
*NL*
had
disappeared
,
he
said
with
a
smile
,
--
''
'T
is
strange
that
it
should
be
*NL*
among
such
men
that
we
find
proofs
of
friendship
and
devotion
.
''
Then
*NL*
he
dragged
himself
cautiously
to
the
top
of
a
rock
,
from
which
he
had
*NL*
a
full
view
of
the
sea
,
and
thence
he
saw
the
tartan
complete
her
*NL*
preparations
for
sailing
,
weigh
anchor
,
and
,
balancing
herself
as
*NL*
gracefully
as
a
water-fowl
ere
it
takes
to
the
wing
,
set
sail
.
At
*NL*
the
end
of
an
hour
she
was
completely
out
of
sight
;
at
least
,
it
was
*NL*
impossible
for
the
wounded
man
to
see
her
any
longer
from
the
spot
where
*NL*
he
was
.
Then
Dantes
rose
more
agile
and
light
than
the
kid
among
the
*NL*
myrtles
and
shrubs
of
these
wild
rocks
,
took
his
gun
in
one
hand
,
his
*NL*
pickaxe
in
the
other
,
and
hastened
towards
the
rock
on
which
the
marks
*NL*
he
had
noted
terminated
.
``
And
now
,
''
he
exclaimed
,
remembering
the
tale
*NL*
of
the
Arabian
fisherman
,
which
Faria
had
related
to
him
,
``
now
,
open
*NL*
sesame
!

Chapter
24
.
The
Secret
Cave
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sun
had
nearly
reached
the
meridian
,
and
his
scorching
rays
fell
*NL*
full
on
the
rocks
,
which
seemed
themselves
sensible
of
the
heat
.
*NL*
Thousands
of
grasshoppers
,
hidden
in
the
bushes
,
chirped
with
a
*NL*
monotonous
and
dull
note
;
the
leaves
of
the
myrtle
and
olive
trees
waved
*NL*
and
rustled
in
the
wind
.
At
every
step
that
Edmond
took
he
disturbed
*NL*
the
lizards
glittering
with
the
hues
of
the
emerald
;
afar
off
he
saw
*NL*
the
wild
goats
bounding
from
crag
to
crag
.
In
a
word
,
the
island
was
*NL*
inhabited
,
yet
Edmond
felt
himself
alone
,
guided
by
the
hand
of
God
.
He
*NL*
felt
an
indescribable
sensation
somewhat
akin
to
dread
--
that
dread
of
*NL*
the
daylight
which
even
in
the
desert
makes
us
fear
we
are
watched
and
*NL*
observed
.
This
feeling
was
so
strong
that
at
the
moment
when
Edmond
was
*NL*
about
to
begin
his
labor
,
he
stopped
,
laid
down
his
pickaxe
,
seized
his
*NL*
gun
,
mounted
to
the
summit
of
the
highest
rock
,
and
from
thence
gazed
*NL*
round
in
every
direction
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
was
not
upon
Corsica
,
the
very
houses
of
which
he
could
*NL*
distinguish
;
or
on
Sardinia
;
or
on
the
Island
of
Elba
,
with
its
*NL*
historical
associations
;
or
upon
the
almost
imperceptible
line
that
to
*NL*
the
experienced
eye
of
a
sailor
alone
revealed
the
coast
of
Genoa
*NL*
the
proud
,
and
Leghorn
the
commercial
,
that
he
gazed
.
It
was
at
the
*NL*
brigantine
that
had
left
in
the
morning
,
and
the
tartan
that
had
just
*NL*
set
sail
,
that
Edmond
fixed
his
eyes
.
The
first
was
just
disappearing
*NL*
in
the
straits
of
Bonifacio
;
the
other
,
following
an
opposite
direction
,
*NL*
was
about
to
round
the
Island
of
Corsica
.
This
sight
reassured
him
.
He
*NL*
then
looked
at
the
objects
near
him
.
He
saw
that
he
was
on
the
highest
*NL*
point
of
the
island
,
--
a
statue
on
this
vast
pedestal
of
granite
,
nothing
*NL*
human
appearing
in
sight
,
while
the
blue
ocean
beat
against
the
base
of
*NL*
the
island
,
and
covered
it
with
a
fringe
of
foam
.
Then
he
descended
with
*NL*
cautious
and
slow
step
,
for
he
dreaded
lest
an
accident
similar
to
that
*NL*
he
had
so
adroitly
feigned
should
happen
in
reality
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dantes
,
as
we
have
said
,
had
traced
the
marks
along
the
rocks
,
and
he
*NL*
had
noticed
that
they
led
to
a
small
creek
,
which
was
hidden
like
the
*NL*
bath
of
some
ancient
nymph
.
This
creek
was
sufficiently
wide
at
its
*NL*
mouth
,
and
deep
in
the
centre
,
to
admit
of
the
entrance
of
a
small
*NL*
vessel
of
the
lugger
class
,
which
would
be
perfectly
concealed
from
*NL*
observation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
following
the
clew
that
,
in
the
hands
of
the
Abbe
Faria
,
had
*NL*
been
so
skilfully
used
to
guide
him
through
the
Daedalian
labyrinth
of
*NL*
probabilities
,
he
thought
that
the
Cardinal
Spada
,
anxious
not
to
be
*NL*
watched
,
had
entered
the
creek
,
concealed
his
little
barque
,
followed
*NL*
the
line
marked
by
the
notches
in
the
rock
,
and
at
the
end
of
it
had
*NL*
buried
his
treasure
.
It
was
this
idea
that
had
brought
Dantes
back
to
*NL*
the
circular
rock
.
One
thing
only
perplexed
Edmond
,
and
destroyed
his
*NL*
theory
.
How
could
this
rock
,
which
weighed
several
tons
,
have
been
*NL*
lifted
to
this
spot
,
without
the
aid
of
many
men
?
Suddenly
an
idea
*NL*
flashed
across
his
mind
.
Instead
of
raising
it
,
thought
he
,
they
have
*NL*
lowered
it
.
And
he
sprang
from
the
rock
in
order
to
inspect
the
base
*NL*
on
which
it
had
formerly
stood
.
He
soon
perceived
that
a
slope
had
been
*NL*
formed
,
and
the
rock
had
slid
along
this
until
it
stopped
at
the
spot
*NL*
it
now
occupied
.
A
large
stone
had
served
as
a
wedge
;
flints
and
pebbles
*NL*
had
been
inserted
around
it
,
so
as
to
conceal
the
orifice
;
this
species
*NL*
of
masonry
had
been
covered
with
earth
,
and
grass
and
weeds
had
grown
*NL*
there
,
moss
had
clung
to
the
stones
,
myrtle-bushes
had
taken
root
,
and
*NL*
the
old
rock
seemed
fixed
to
the
earth
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dantes
dug
away
the
earth
carefully
,
and
detected
,
or
fancied
he
*NL*
detected
,
the
ingenious
artifice
.
He
attacked
this
wall
,
cemented
by
the
*NL*
hand
of
time
,
with
his
pickaxe
.
After
ten
minutes
'
labor
the
wall
gave
*NL*
way
,
and
a
hole
large
enough
to
insert
the
arm
was
opened
.
Dantes
*NL*
went
and
cut
the
strongest
olive-tree
he
could
find
,
stripped
off
its
*NL*
branches
,
inserted
it
in
the
hole
,
and
used
it
as
a
lever
.
But
the
rock
*NL*
was
too
heavy
,
and
too
firmly
wedged
,
to
be
moved
by
any
one
man
,
were
*NL*
he
Hercules
himself
.
Dantes
saw
that
he
must
attack
the
wedge
.
But
*NL*
how
?
He
cast
his
eyes
around
,
and
saw
the
horn
full
of
powder
which
*NL*
his
friend
Jacopo
had
left
him
.
He
smiled
;
the
infernal
invention
would
*NL*
serve
him
for
this
purpose
.
With
the
aid
of
his
pickaxe
,
Dantes
,
after
*NL*
the
manner
of
a
labor-saving
pioneer
,
dug
a
mine
between
the
upper
rock
*NL*
and
the
one
that
supported
it
,
filled
it
with
powder
,
then
made
a
match
*NL*
by
rolling
his
handkerchief
in
saltpetre
.
He
lighted
it
and
retired
.
The
*NL*
explosion
soon
followed
;
the
upper
rock
was
lifted
from
its
base
by
the
*NL*
terrific
force
of
the
powder
;
the
lower
one
flew
into
pieces
;
thousands
*NL*
of
insects
escaped
from
the
aperture
Dantes
had
previously
formed
,
and
*NL*
a
huge
snake
,
like
the
guardian
demon
of
the
treasure
,
rolled
himself
*NL*
along
in
darkening
coils
,
and
disappeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dantes
approached
the
upper
rock
,
which
now
,
without
any
support
,
leaned
*NL*
towards
the
sea
.
The
intrepid
treasure-seeker
walked
round
it
,
and
,
*NL*
selecting
the
spot
from
whence
it
appeared
most
susceptible
to
attack
,
*NL*
placed
his
lever
in
one
of
the
crevices
,
and
strained
every
nerve
to
*NL*
move
the
mass
.
The
rock
,
already
shaken
by
the
explosion
,
tottered
*NL*
on
its
base
.
Dantes
redoubled
his
efforts
;
he
seemed
like
one
of
the
*NL*
ancient
Titans
,
who
uprooted
the
mountains
to
hurl
against
the
father
*NL*
of
the
gods
.
The
rock
yielded
,
rolled
over
,
bounded
from
point
to
point
,
*NL*
and
finally
disappeared
in
the
ocean
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
spot
it
had
occupied
was
a
circular
space
,
exposing
an
iron
ring
*NL*
let
into
a
square
flag-stone
.
Dantes
uttered
a
cry
of
joy
and
surprise
;
*NL*
never
had
a
first
attempt
been
crowned
with
more
perfect
success
.
He
*NL*
would
fain
have
continued
,
but
his
knees
trembled
,
and
his
heart
beat
*NL*
so
violently
,
and
his
sight
became
so
dim
,
that
he
was
forced
to
pause
.
*NL*
This
feeling
lasted
but
for
a
moment
.
Edmond
inserted
his
lever
in
the
*NL*
ring
and
exerted
all
his
strength
;
the
flag-stone
yielded
,
and
disclosed
*NL*
steps
that
descended
until
they
were
lost
in
the
obscurity
of
a
*NL*
subterraneous
grotto
.
Any
one
else
would
have
rushed
on
with
a
cry
of
*NL*
joy
.
Dantes
turned
pale
,
hesitated
,
and
reflected
.
``
Come
,
''
said
he
to
*NL*
himself
,
``
be
a
man
.
I
am
accustomed
to
adversity
.
I
must
not
be
cast
*NL*
down
by
the
discovery
that
I
have
been
deceived
.
What
,
then
,
would
be
*NL*
the
use
of
all
I
have
suffered
?
The
heart
breaks
when
,
after
having
been
*NL*
elated
by
flattering
hopes
,
it
sees
all
its
illusions
destroyed
.
Faria
*NL*
has
dreamed
this
;
the
Cardinal
Spada
buried
no
treasure
here
;
perhaps
he
*NL*
never
came
here
,
or
if
he
did
,
Caesar
Borgia
,
the
intrepid
adventurer
,
*NL*
the
stealthy
and
indefatigable
plunderer
,
has
followed
him
,
discovered
*NL*
his
traces
,
pursued
them
as
I
have
done
,
raised
the
stone
,
and
*NL*
descending
before
me
,
has
left
me
nothing
.
''
He
remained
motionless
and
*NL*
pensive
,
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
gloomy
aperture
that
was
open
at
his
*NL*
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
that
I
expect
nothing
,
now
that
I
no
longer
entertain
the
slightest
*NL*
hopes
,
the
end
of
this
adventure
becomes
simply
a
matter
of
curiosity
.
''
*NL*
And
he
remained
again
motionless
and
thoughtful
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
;
this
is
an
adventure
worthy
a
place
in
the
varied
career
of
*NL*
that
royal
bandit
.
This
fabulous
event
formed
but
a
link
in
a
long
chain
*NL*
of
marvels
.
Yes
,
Borgia
has
been
here
,
a
torch
in
one
hand
,
a
sword
in
*NL*
the
other
,
and
within
twenty
paces
,
at
the
foot
of
this
rock
,
perhaps
*NL*
two
guards
kept
watch
on
land
and
sea
,
while
their
master
descended
,
as
*NL*
I
am
about
to
descend
,
dispelling
the
darkness
before
his
awe-inspiring
*NL*
progress
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
was
the
fate
of
the
guards
who
thus
possessed
his
secret
?
''
*NL*
asked
Dantes
of
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
fate
,
''
replied
he
,
smiling
,
``
of
those
who
buried
Alaric
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yet
,
had
he
come
,
''
thought
Dantes
,
``
he
would
have
found
the
treasure
,
*NL*
and
Borgia
,
he
who
compared
Italy
to
an
artichoke
,
which
he
could
devour
*NL*
leaf
by
leaf
,
knew
too
well
the
value
of
time
to
waste
it
in
replacing
*NL*
this
rock
.
I
will
go
down
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
descended
,
a
smile
on
his
lips
,
and
murmuring
that
last
word
of
*NL*
human
philosophy
,
``
Perhaps
!
''
But
instead
of
the
darkness
,
and
the
thick
*NL*
and
mephitic
atmosphere
he
had
expected
to
find
,
Dantes
saw
a
dim
and
*NL*
bluish
light
,
which
,
as
well
as
the
air
,
entered
,
not
merely
by
the
*NL*
aperture
he
had
just
formed
,
but
by
the
interstices
and
crevices
of
*NL*
the
rock
which
were
visible
from
without
,
and
through
which
he
could
*NL*
distinguish
the
blue
sky
and
the
waving
branches
of
the
evergreen
oaks
,
*NL*
and
the
tendrils
of
the
creepers
that
grew
from
the
rocks
.
After
having
*NL*
stood
a
few
minutes
in
the
cavern
,
the
atmosphere
of
which
was
rather
*NL*
warm
than
damp
,
Dantes
'
eye
,
habituated
as
it
was
to
darkness
,
could
*NL*
pierce
even
to
the
remotest
angles
of
the
cavern
,
which
was
of
granite
*NL*
that
sparkled
like
diamonds
.
``
Alas
,
''
said
Edmond
,
smiling
,
``
these
are
*NL*
the
treasures
the
cardinal
has
left
;
and
the
good
abbe
,
seeing
in
a
*NL*
dream
these
glittering
walls
,
has
indulged
in
fallacious
hopes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
called
to
mind
the
words
of
the
will
,
which
he
knew
by
heart
.
``
In
*NL*
the
farthest
angle
of
the
second
opening
,
''
said
the
cardinal
's
will
.
He
*NL*
had
only
found
the
first
grotto
;
he
had
now
to
seek
the
second
.
*NL*
Dantes
continued
his
search
.
He
reflected
that
this
second
grotto
must
*NL*
penetrate
deeper
into
the
island
;
he
examined
the
stones
,
and
sounded
*NL*
one
part
of
the
wall
where
he
fancied
the
opening
existed
,
masked
for
*NL*
precaution
's
sake
.
The
pickaxe
struck
for
a
moment
with
a
dull
sound
*NL*
that
drew
out
of
Dantes
'
forehead
large
drops
of
perspiration
.
At
last
*NL*
it
seemed
to
him
that
one
part
of
the
wall
gave
forth
a
more
hollow
and
*NL*
deeper
echo
;
he
eagerly
advanced
,
and
with
the
quickness
of
perception
*NL*
that
no
one
but
a
prisoner
possesses
,
saw
that
there
,
in
all
*NL*
probability
,
the
opening
must
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
he
,
like
Caesar
Borgia
,
knew
the
value
of
time
;
and
,
in
*NL*
order
to
avoid
fruitless
toil
,
he
sounded
all
the
other
walls
with
his
*NL*
pickaxe
,
struck
the
earth
with
the
butt
of
his
gun
,
and
finding
nothing
*NL*
that
appeared
suspicious
,
returned
to
that
part
of
the
wall
whence
*NL*
issued
the
consoling
sound
he
had
before
heard
.
He
again
struck
it
,
and
*NL*
with
greater
force
.
Then
a
singular
thing
occurred
.
As
he
struck
the
*NL*
wall
,
pieces
of
stucco
similar
to
that
used
in
the
ground
work
of
*NL*
arabesques
broke
off
,
and
fell
to
the
ground
in
flakes
,
exposing
a
large
*NL*
white
stone
.
The
aperture
of
the
rock
had
been
closed
with
stones
,
then
*NL*
this
stucco
had
been
applied
,
and
painted
to
imitate
granite
.
Dantes
*NL*
struck
with
the
sharp
end
of
his
pickaxe
,
which
entered
someway
between
*NL*
the
interstices
.
It
was
there
he
must
dig
.
But
by
some
strange
play
of
*NL*
emotion
,
in
proportion
as
the
proofs
that
Faria
,
had
not
been
*NL*
deceived
became
stronger
,
so
did
his
heart
give
way
,
and
a
feeling
of
*NL*
discouragement
stole
over
him
.
This
last
proof
,
instead
of
giving
him
*NL*
fresh
strength
,
deprived
him
of
it
;
the
pickaxe
descended
,
or
rather
*NL*
fell
;
he
placed
it
on
the
ground
,
passed
his
hand
over
his
brow
,
and
*NL*
remounted
the
stairs
,
alleging
to
himself
,
as
an
excuse
,
a
desire
to
*NL*
be
assured
that
no
one
was
watching
him
,
but
in
reality
because
he
felt
*NL*
that
he
was
about
to
faint
.
The
island
was
deserted
,
and
the
sun
seemed
*NL*
to
cover
it
with
its
fiery
glance
;
afar
off
,
a
few
small
fishing
boats
*NL*
studded
the
bosom
of
the
blue
ocean
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dantes
had
tasted
nothing
,
but
he
thought
not
of
hunger
at
such
a
*NL*
moment
;
he
hastily
swallowed
a
few
drops
of
rum
,
and
again
entered
the
*NL*
cavern
.
The
pickaxe
that
had
seemed
so
heavy
,
was
now
like
a
feather
in
*NL*
his
grasp
;
he
seized
it
,
and
attacked
the
wall
.
After
several
blows
he
*NL*
perceived
that
the
stones
were
not
cemented
,
but
had
been
merely
placed
*NL*
one
upon
the
other
,
and
covered
with
stucco
;
he
inserted
the
point
of
*NL*
his
pickaxe
,
and
using
the
handle
as
a
lever
,
with
joy
soon
saw
the
*NL*
stone
turn
as
if
on
hinges
,
and
fall
at
his
feet
.
He
had
nothing
more
*NL*
to
do
now
,
but
with
the
iron
tooth
of
the
pickaxe
to
draw
the
stones
*NL*
towards
him
one
by
one
.
The
aperture
was
already
sufficiently
large
for
*NL*
him
to
enter
,
but
by
waiting
,
he
could
still
cling
to
hope
,
and
retard
*NL*
the
certainty
of
deception
.
At
last
,
after
renewed
hesitation
,
Dantes
*NL*
entered
the
second
grotto
.
The
second
grotto
was
lower
and
more
gloomy
*NL*
than
the
first
;
the
air
that
could
only
enter
by
the
newly
formed
*NL*
opening
had
the
mephitic
smell
Dantes
was
surprised
not
to
find
in
the
*NL*
outer
cavern
.
He
waited
in
order
to
allow
pure
air
to
displace
the
foul
*NL*
atmosphere
,
and
then
went
on
.
At
the
left
of
the
opening
was
a
dark
and
*NL*
deep
angle
.
But
to
Dantes
'
eye
there
was
no
darkness
.
He
glanced
around
*NL*
this
second
grotto
;
it
was
,
like
the
first
,
empty
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
treasure
,
if
it
existed
,
was
buried
in
this
corner
.
The
time
had
*NL*
at
length
arrived
;
two
feet
of
earth
removed
,
and
Dantes
'
fate
would
*NL*
be
decided
.
He
advanced
towards
the
angle
,
and
summoning
all
his
*NL*
resolution
,
attacked
the
ground
with
the
pickaxe
.
At
the
fifth
or
sixth
*NL*
blow
the
pickaxe
struck
against
an
iron
substance
.
Never
did
funeral
*NL*
knell
,
never
did
alarm-bell
,
produce
a
greater
effect
on
the
hearer
.
*NL*
Had
Dantes
found
nothing
he
could
not
have
become
more
ghastly
pale
.
*NL*
He
again
struck
his
pickaxe
into
the
earth
,
and
encountered
the
same
*NL*
resistance
,
but
not
the
same
sound
.
``
It
is
a
casket
of
wood
bound
with
*NL*
iron
,
''
thought
he
.
At
this
moment
a
shadow
passed
rapidly
before
the
*NL*
opening
;
Dantes
seized
his
gun
,
sprang
through
the
opening
,
and
mounted
*NL*
the
stair
.
A
wild
goat
had
passed
before
the
mouth
of
the
cave
,
and
was
*NL*
feeding
at
a
little
distance
.
This
would
have
been
a
favorable
occasion
*NL*
to
secure
his
dinner
;
but
Dantes
feared
lest
the
report
of
his
gun
*NL*
should
attract
attention
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
thought
a
moment
,
cut
a
branch
of
a
resinous
tree
,
lighted
it
at
the
*NL*
fire
at
which
the
smugglers
had
prepared
their
breakfast
,
and
descended
*NL*
with
this
torch
.
He
wished
to
see
everything
.
He
approached
the
hole
he
*NL*
had
dug
,
and
now
,
with
the
aid
of
the
torch
,
saw
that
his
pickaxe
had
in
*NL*
reality
struck
against
iron
and
wood
.
He
planted
his
torch
in
the
ground
*NL*
and
resumed
his
labor
.
In
an
instant
a
space
three
feet
long
by
two
feet
*NL*
broad
was
cleared
,
and
Dantes
could
see
an
oaken
coffer
,
bound
with
cut
*NL*
steel
;
in
the
middle
of
the
lid
he
saw
engraved
on
a
silver
plate
,
which
*NL*
was
still
untarnished
,
the
arms
of
the
Spada
family
--
viz.
,
a
sword
,
*NL*
pale
,
on
an
oval
shield
,
like
all
the
Italian
armorial
bearings
,
and
*NL*
surmounted
by
a
cardinal
's
hat
;
Dantes
easily
recognized
them
,
Faria
had
*NL*
so
often
drawn
them
for
him
.
There
was
no
longer
any
doubt
:
the
treasure
*NL*
was
there
--
no
one
would
have
been
at
such
pains
to
conceal
an
empty
*NL*
casket
.
In
an
instant
he
had
cleared
every
obstacle
away
,
and
he
saw
*NL*
successively
the
lock
,
placed
between
two
padlocks
,
and
the
two
handles
*NL*
at
each
end
,
all
carved
as
things
were
carved
at
that
epoch
,
when
art
*NL*
rendered
the
commonest
metals
precious
.
Dantes
seized
the
handles
,
and
*NL*
strove
to
lift
the
coffer
;
it
was
impossible
.
He
sought
to
open
it
;
lock
*NL*
and
padlock
were
fastened
;
these
faithful
guardians
seemed
unwilling
*NL*
to
surrender
their
trust
.
Dantes
inserted
the
sharp
end
of
the
pickaxe
*NL*
between
the
coffer
and
the
lid
,
and
pressing
with
all
his
force
on
the
*NL*
handle
,
burst
open
the
fastenings
.
The
hinges
yielded
in
their
turn
and
*NL*
fell
,
still
holding
in
their
grasp
fragments
of
the
wood
,
and
the
chest
*NL*
was
open
.
*NL*
*NL*
Edmond
was
seized
with
vertigo
;
he
cocked
his
gun
and
laid
it
beside
*NL*
him
.
He
then
closed
his
eyes
as
children
do
in
order
that
they
may
see
*NL*
in
the
resplendent
night
of
their
own
imagination
more
stars
than
are
*NL*
visible
in
the
firmament
;
then
he
re-opened
them
,
and
stood
motionless
*NL*
with
amazement
.
Three
compartments
divided
the
coffer
.
In
the
first
,
*NL*
blazed
piles
of
golden
coin
;
in
the
second
,
were
ranged
bars
of
*NL*
unpolished
gold
,
which
possessed
nothing
attractive
save
their
value
;
*NL*
in
the
third
,
Edmond
grasped
handfuls
of
diamonds
,
pearls
,
and
rubies
,
*NL*
which
,
as
they
fell
on
one
another
,
sounded
like
hail
against
glass
.
*NL*
After
having
touched
,
felt
,
examined
these
treasures
,
Edmond
rushed
*NL*
through
the
caverns
like
a
man
seized
with
frenzy
;
he
leaped
on
a
rock
,
*NL*
from
whence
he
could
behold
the
sea
.
He
was
alone
--
alone
with
these
*NL*
countless
,
these
unheard-of
treasures
!
was
he
awake
,
or
was
it
but
a
*NL*
dream
?
*NL*
*NL*
He
would
fain
have
gazed
upon
his
gold
,
and
yet
he
had
not
strength
*NL*
enough
;
for
an
instant
he
leaned
his
head
in
his
hands
as
if
to
prevent
*NL*
his
senses
from
leaving
him
,
and
then
rushed
madly
about
the
rocks
of
*NL*
Monte
Cristo
,
terrifying
the
wild
goats
and
scaring
the
sea-fowls
with
*NL*
his
wild
cries
and
gestures
;
then
he
returned
,
and
,
still
unable
to
*NL*
believe
the
evidence
of
his
senses
,
rushed
into
the
grotto
,
and
found
*NL*
himself
before
this
mine
of
gold
and
jewels
.
This
time
he
fell
on
*NL*
his
knees
,
and
,
clasping
his
hands
convulsively
,
uttered
a
prayer
*NL*
intelligible
to
God
alone
.
He
soon
became
calmer
and
more
happy
,
for
*NL*
only
now
did
he
begin
to
realize
his
felicity
.
He
then
set
himself
to
*NL*
work
to
count
his
fortune
.
There
were
a
thousand
ingots
of
gold
,
each
*NL*
weighing
from
two
to
three
pounds
;
then
he
piled
up
twenty-five
thousand
*NL*
crowns
,
each
worth
about
eighty
francs
of
our
money
,
and
bearing
the
*NL*
effigies
of
Alexander
VI
.
and
his
predecessors
;
and
he
saw
that
the
*NL*
complement
was
not
half
empty
.
And
he
measured
ten
double
handfuls
of
*NL*
pearls
,
diamonds
,
and
other
gems
,
many
of
which
,
mounted
by
the
most
*NL*
famous
workmen
,
were
valuable
beyond
their
intrinsic
worth
.
Dantes
*NL*
saw
the
light
gradually
disappear
,
and
fearing
to
be
surprised
in
the
*NL*
cavern
,
left
it
,
his
gun
in
his
hand
.
A
piece
of
biscuit
and
a
small
*NL*
quantity
of
rum
formed
his
supper
,
and
he
snatched
a
few
hours
'
sleep
,
*NL*
lying
over
the
mouth
of
the
cave
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
night
of
joy
and
terror
,
such
as
this
man
of
stupendous
*NL*
emotions
had
already
experienced
twice
or
thrice
in
his
lifetime
.

*NL*
Chapter
25
.
The
Unknown
.
*NL*
*NL*
Day
,
for
which
Dantes
had
so
eagerly
and
impatiently
waited
with
open
*NL*
eyes
,
again
dawned
.
With
the
first
light
Dantes
resumed
his
search
.
*NL*
Again
he
climbed
the
rocky
height
he
had
ascended
the
previous
evening
,
*NL*
and
strained
his
view
to
catch
every
peculiarity
of
the
landscape
;
*NL*
but
it
wore
the
same
wild
,
barren
aspect
when
seen
by
the
rays
of
the
*NL*
morning
sun
which
it
had
done
when
surveyed
by
the
fading
glimmer
of
*NL*
eve
.
Descending
into
the
grotto
,
he
lifted
the
stone
,
filled
his
pockets
*NL*
with
gems
,
put
the
box
together
as
well
and
securely
as
he
could
,
*NL*
sprinkled
fresh
sand
over
the
spot
from
which
it
had
been
taken
,
and
*NL*
then
carefully
trod
down
the
earth
to
give
it
everywhere
a
uniform
*NL*
appearance
;
then
,
quitting
the
grotto
,
he
replaced
the
stone
,
heaping
*NL*
on
it
broken
masses
of
rocks
and
rough
fragments
of
crumbling
granite
,
*NL*
filling
the
interstices
with
earth
,
into
which
he
deftly
inserted
*NL*
rapidly
growing
plants
,
such
as
the
wild
myrtle
and
flowering
thorn
,
*NL*
then
carefully
watering
these
new
plantations
,
he
scrupulously
effaced
*NL*
every
trace
of
footsteps
,
leaving
the
approach
to
the
cavern
as
*NL*
savage-looking
and
untrodden
as
he
had
found
it
.
This
done
,
he
*NL*
impatiently
awaited
the
return
of
his
companions
.
To
wait
at
Monte
*NL*
Cristo
for
the
purpose
of
watching
like
a
dragon
over
the
almost
*NL*
incalculable
riches
that
had
thus
fallen
into
his
possession
satisfied
*NL*
not
the
cravings
of
his
heart
,
which
yearned
to
return
to
dwell
among
*NL*
mankind
,
and
to
assume
the
rank
,
power
,
and
influence
which
are
always
*NL*
accorded
to
wealth
--
that
first
and
greatest
of
all
the
forces
within
the
*NL*
grasp
of
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
sixth
day
,
the
smugglers
returned
.
From
a
distance
Dantes
*NL*
recognized
the
rig
and
handling
of
The
Young
Amelia
,
and
dragging
*NL*
himself
with
affected
difficulty
towards
the
landing-place
,
he
met
his
*NL*
companions
with
an
assurance
that
,
although
considerably
better
than
*NL*
when
they
quitted
him
,
he
still
suffered
acutely
from
his
late
accident
.
*NL*
He
then
inquired
how
they
had
fared
in
their
trip
.
To
this
question
the
*NL*
smugglers
replied
that
,
although
successful
in
landing
their
cargo
in
*NL*
safety
,
they
had
scarcely
done
so
when
they
received
intelligence
that
a
*NL*
guard-ship
had
just
quitted
the
port
of
Toulon
and
was
crowding
all
*NL*
sail
towards
them
.
This
obliged
them
to
make
all
the
speed
they
could
to
*NL*
evade
the
enemy
,
when
they
could
but
lament
the
absence
of
Dantes
,
whose
*NL*
superior
skill
in
the
management
of
a
vessel
would
have
availed
them
so
*NL*
materially
.
In
fact
,
the
pursuing
vessel
had
almost
overtaken
them
*NL*
when
,
fortunately
,
night
came
on
,
and
enabled
them
to
double
the
Cape
of
*NL*
Corsica
,
and
so
elude
all
further
pursuit
.
Upon
the
whole
,
however
,
the
*NL*
trip
had
been
sufficiently
successful
to
satisfy
all
concerned
;
while
*NL*
the
crew
,
and
particularly
Jacopo
,
expressed
great
regrets
that
Dantes
*NL*
had
not
been
an
equal
sharer
with
themselves
in
the
profits
,
which
*NL*
amounted
to
no
less
a
sum
than
fifty
piastres
each
.
*NL*
*NL*
Edmond
preserved
the
most
admirable
self-command
,
not
suffering
the
*NL*
faintest
indication
of
a
smile
to
escape
him
at
the
enumeration
of
all
*NL*
the
benefits
he
would
have
reaped
had
he
been
able
to
quit
the
island
;
*NL*
but
as
The
Young
Amelia
had
merely
come
to
Monte
Cristo
to
fetch
him
*NL*
away
,
he
embarked
that
same
evening
,
and
proceeded
with
the
captain
to
*NL*
Leghorn
.
Arrived
at
Leghorn
,
he
repaired
to
the
house
of
a
Jew
,
a
dealer
*NL*
in
precious
stones
,
to
whom
he
disposed
of
four
of
his
smallest
diamonds
*NL*
for
five
thousand
francs
each
.
Dantes
half
feared
that
such
valuable
*NL*
jewels
in
the
hands
of
a
poor
sailor
like
himself
might
excite
*NL*
suspicion
;
but
the
cunning
purchaser
asked
no
troublesome
questions
*NL*
concerning
a
bargain
by
which
he
gained
a
round
profit
of
at
least
*NL*
eighty
per
cent
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
following
day
Dantes
presented
Jacopo
with
an
entirely
new
vessel
,
*NL*
accompanying
the
gift
by
a
donation
of
one
hundred
piastres
,
that
he
*NL*
might
provide
himself
with
a
suitable
crew
and
other
requisites
for
his
*NL*
outfit
,
upon
condition
that
he
would
go
at
once
to
Marseilles
for
the
*NL*
purpose
of
inquiring
after
an
old
man
named
Louis
Dantes
,
residing
*NL*
in
the
Allees
de
Meillan
,
and
also
a
young
woman
called
Mercedes
,
an
*NL*
inhabitant
of
the
Catalan
village
.
Jacopo
could
scarcely
believe
his
*NL*
senses
at
receiving
this
magnificent
present
,
which
Dantes
hastened
to
*NL*
account
for
by
saying
that
he
had
merely
been
a
sailor
from
whim
and
a
*NL*
desire
to
spite
his
family
,
who
did
not
allow
him
as
much
money
as
he
*NL*
liked
to
spend
;
but
that
on
his
arrival
at
Leghorn
he
had
come
into
*NL*
possession
of
a
large
fortune
,
left
him
by
an
uncle
,
whose
sole
heir
*NL*
he
was
.
The
superior
education
of
Dantes
gave
an
air
of
such
extreme
*NL*
probability
to
this
statement
that
it
never
once
occurred
to
Jacopo
to
*NL*
doubt
its
accuracy
.
The
term
for
which
Edmond
had
engaged
to
serve
on
*NL*
board
The
Young
Amelia
having
expired
,
Dantes
took
leave
of
the
captain
,
*NL*
who
at
first
tried
all
his
powers
of
persuasion
to
induce
him
to
remain
*NL*
as
one
of
the
crew
,
but
having
been
told
the
history
of
the
legacy
,
he
*NL*
ceased
to
importune
him
further
.
The
following
morning
Jacopo
set
sail
*NL*
for
Marseilles
,
with
directions
from
Dantes
to
join
him
at
the
Island
of
*NL*
Monte
Cristo
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
seen
Jacopo
fairly
out
of
the
harbor
,
Dantes
proceeded
to
make
*NL*
his
final
adieus
on
board
The
Young
Amelia
,
distributing
so
liberal
a
*NL*
gratuity
among
her
crew
as
to
secure
for
him
the
good
wishes
of
all
,
*NL*
and
expressions
of
cordial
interest
in
all
that
concerned
him
.
To
the
*NL*
captain
he
promised
to
write
when
he
had
made
up
his
mind
as
to
his
*NL*
future
plans
.
Then
Dantes
departed
for
Genoa
.
At
the
moment
of
his
*NL*
arrival
a
small
yacht
was
under
trial
in
the
bay
;
this
yacht
had
been
*NL*
built
by
order
of
an
Englishman
,
who
,
having
heard
that
the
Genoese
*NL*
excelled
all
other
builders
along
the
shores
of
the
Mediterranean
in
*NL*
the
construction
of
fast-sailing
vessels
,
was
desirous
of
possessing
a
*NL*
specimen
of
their
skill
;
the
price
agreed
upon
between
the
Englishman
*NL*
and
the
Genoese
builder
was
forty
thousand
francs
.
Dantes
,
struck
with
*NL*
the
beauty
and
capability
of
the
little
vessel
,
applied
to
its
owner
to
*NL*
transfer
it
to
him
,
offering
sixty
thousand
francs
,
upon
condition
that
*NL*
he
should
be
allowed
to
take
immediate
possession
.
The
proposal
was
too
*NL*
advantageous
to
be
refused
,
the
more
so
as
the
person
for
whom
the
*NL*
yacht
was
intended
had
gone
upon
a
tour
through
Switzerland
,
and
was
*NL*
not
expected
back
in
less
than
three
weeks
or
a
month
,
by
which
time
*NL*
the
builder
reckoned
upon
being
able
to
complete
another
.
A
bargain
was
*NL*
therefore
struck
.
Dantes
led
the
owner
of
the
yacht
to
the
dwelling
of
*NL*
a
Jew
;
retired
with
the
latter
for
a
few
minutes
to
a
small
back
parlor
,
*NL*
and
upon
their
return
the
Jew
counted
out
to
the
shipbuilder
the
sum
of
*NL*
sixty
thousand
francs
in
bright
gold
pieces
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
delighted
builder
then
offered
his
services
in
providing
a
suitable
*NL*
crew
for
the
little
vessel
,
but
this
Dantes
declined
with
many
thanks
,
*NL*
saying
he
was
accustomed
to
cruise
about
quite
alone
,
and
his
principal
*NL*
pleasure
consisted
in
managing
his
yacht
himself
;
the
only
thing
the
*NL*
builder
could
oblige
him
in
would
be
to
contrive
a
sort
of
secret
closet
*NL*
in
the
cabin
at
his
bed
's
head
,
the
closet
to
contain
three
divisions
,
*NL*
so
constructed
as
to
be
concealed
from
all
but
himself
.
The
builder
*NL*
cheerfully
undertook
the
commission
,
and
promised
to
have
these
secret
*NL*
places
completed
by
the
next
day
,
Dantes
furnishing
the
dimensions
and
*NL*
plan
in
accordance
with
which
they
were
to
be
constructed
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
following
day
Dantes
sailed
with
his
yacht
from
Genoa
,
under
the
*NL*
inspection
of
an
immense
crowd
drawn
together
by
curiosity
to
see
the
*NL*
rich
Spanish
nobleman
who
preferred
managing
his
own
yacht
.
But
their
*NL*
wonder
was
soon
changed
to
admiration
at
seeing
the
perfect
skill
with
*NL*
which
Dantes
handled
the
helm
.
The
boat
,
indeed
,
seemed
to
be
animated
*NL*
with
almost
human
intelligence
,
so
promptly
did
it
obey
the
slightest
*NL*
touch
;
and
Dantes
required
but
a
short
trial
of
his
beautiful
craft
to
*NL*
acknowledge
that
the
Genoese
had
not
without
reason
attained
their
*NL*
high
reputation
in
the
art
of
shipbuilding
.
The
spectators
followed
the
*NL*
little
vessel
with
their
eyes
as
long
as
it
remained
visible
;
they
then
*NL*
turned
their
conjectures
upon
her
probable
destination
.
Some
insisted
*NL*
she
was
making
for
Corsica
,
others
the
Island
of
Elba
;
bets
were
offered
*NL*
to
any
amount
that
she
was
bound
for
Spain
;
while
Africa
was
positively
*NL*
reported
by
many
persons
as
her
intended
course
;
but
no
one
thought
of
*NL*
Monte
Cristo
.
Yet
thither
it
was
that
Dantes
guided
his
vessel
,
and
at
*NL*
Monte
Cristo
he
arrived
at
the
close
of
the
second
day
;
his
boat
had
*NL*
proved
herself
a
first-class
sailer
,
and
had
come
the
distance
from
*NL*
Genoa
in
thirty-five
hours
.
Dantes
had
carefully
noted
the
general
*NL*
appearance
of
the
shore
,
and
,
instead
of
landing
at
the
usual
place
,
he
*NL*
dropped
anchor
in
the
little
creek
.
The
island
was
utterly
deserted
,
and
*NL*
bore
no
evidence
of
having
been
visited
since
he
went
away
;
his
treasure
*NL*
was
just
as
he
had
left
it
.
Early
on
the
following
morning
he
commenced
*NL*
the
removal
of
his
riches
,
and
ere
nightfall
the
whole
of
his
immense
*NL*
wealth
was
safely
deposited
in
the
compartments
of
the
secret
locker
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
week
passed
by
.
Dantes
employed
it
in
manoeuvring
his
yacht
round
the
*NL*
island
,
studying
it
as
a
skilful
horseman
would
the
animal
he
destined
*NL*
for
some
important
service
,
till
at
the
end
of
that
time
he
was
*NL*
perfectly
conversant
with
its
good
and
bad
qualities
.
The
former
Dantes
*NL*
proposed
to
augment
,
the
latter
to
remedy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Upon
the
eighth
day
he
discerned
a
small
vessel
under
full
sail
*NL*
approaching
Monte
Cristo
.
As
it
drew
near
,
he
recognized
it
as
the
boat
*NL*
he
had
given
to
Jacopo
.
He
immediately
signalled
it
.
His
signal
was
*NL*
returned
,
and
in
two
hours
afterwards
the
new-comer
lay
at
anchor
beside
*NL*
the
yacht
.
A
mournful
answer
awaited
each
of
Edmond
's
eager
inquiries
*NL*
as
to
the
information
Jacopo
had
obtained
.
Old
Dantes
was
dead
,
and
*NL*
Mercedes
had
disappeared
.
Dantes
listened
to
these
melancholy
tidings
*NL*
with
outward
calmness
;
but
,
leaping
lightly
ashore
,
he
signified
his
*NL*
desire
to
be
quite
alone
.
In
a
couple
of
hours
he
returned
.
Two
of
the
*NL*
men
from
Jacopo
's
boat
came
on
board
the
yacht
to
assist
in
navigating
*NL*
it
,
and
he
gave
orders
that
she
should
be
steered
direct
to
Marseilles
.
*NL*
For
his
father
's
death
he
was
in
some
manner
prepared
;
but
he
knew
not
*NL*
how
to
account
for
the
mysterious
disappearance
of
Mercedes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Without
divulging
his
secret
,
Dantes
could
not
give
sufficiently
clear
*NL*
instructions
to
an
agent
.
There
were
,
besides
,
other
particulars
he
*NL*
was
desirous
of
ascertaining
,
and
those
were
of
a
nature
he
alone
could
*NL*
investigate
in
a
manner
satisfactory
to
himself
.
His
looking-glass
*NL*
had
assured
him
,
during
his
stay
at
Leghorn
,
that
he
ran
no
risk
of
*NL*
recognition
;
moreover
,
he
had
now
the
means
of
adopting
any
disguise
*NL*
he
thought
proper
.
One
fine
morning
,
then
,
his
yacht
,
followed
by
the
*NL*
little
fishing-boat
,
boldly
entered
the
port
of
Marseilles
,
and
anchored
*NL*
exactly
opposite
the
spot
from
whence
,
on
the
never-to-be-forgotten
*NL*
night
of
his
departure
for
the
Chateau
d'If
,
he
had
been
put
on
board
*NL*
the
boat
destined
to
convey
him
thither
.
Still
Dantes
could
not
view
*NL*
without
a
shudder
the
approach
of
a
gendarme
who
accompanied
the
*NL*
officers
deputed
to
demand
his
bill
of
health
ere
the
yacht
was
*NL*
permitted
to
hold
communication
with
the
shore
;
but
with
that
perfect
*NL*
self-possession
he
had
acquired
during
his
acquaintance
with
Faria
,
*NL*
Dantes
coolly
presented
an
English
passport
he
had
obtained
from
*NL*
Leghorn
,
and
as
this
gave
him
a
standing
which
a
French
passport
would
*NL*
not
have
afforded
,
he
was
informed
that
there
existed
no
obstacle
to
his
*NL*
immediate
debarkation
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
person
to
attract
the
attention
of
Dantes
,
as
he
landed
on
the
*NL*
Canebiere
,
was
one
of
the
crew
belonging
to
the
Pharaon
.
Edmond
welcomed
*NL*
the
meeting
with
this
fellow
--
who
had
been
one
of
his
own
sailors
--
as
a
*NL*
sure
means
of
testing
the
extent
of
the
change
which
time
had
worked
in
*NL*
his
own
appearance
.
Going
straight
towards
him
,
he
propounded
a
variety
*NL*
of
questions
on
different
subjects
,
carefully
watching
the
man
's
*NL*
countenance
as
he
did
so
;
but
not
a
word
or
look
implied
that
he
had
the
*NL*
slightest
idea
of
ever
having
seen
before
the
person
with
whom
he
was
*NL*
then
conversing
.
Giving
the
sailor
a
piece
of
money
in
return
for
his
*NL*
civility
,
Dantes
proceeded
onwards
;
but
ere
he
had
gone
many
steps
he
*NL*
heard
the
man
loudly
calling
him
to
stop
.
Dantes
instantly
turned
to
*NL*
meet
him
.
``
I
beg
your
pardon
,
sir
,
''
said
the
honest
fellow
,
in
almost
*NL*
breathless
haste
,
``
but
I
believe
you
made
a
mistake
;
you
intended
to
*NL*
give
me
a
two-franc
piece
,
and
see
,
you
gave
me
a
double
Napoleon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
my
good
friend
.
I
see
that
I
have
made
a
trifling
mistake
,
*NL*
as
you
say
;
but
by
way
of
rewarding
your
honesty
I
give
you
another
*NL*
double
Napoleon
,
that
you
may
drink
to
my
health
,
and
be
able
to
ask
*NL*
your
messmates
to
join
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
extreme
was
the
surprise
of
the
sailor
,
that
he
was
unable
even
*NL*
to
thank
Edmond
,
whose
receding
figure
he
continued
to
gaze
after
in
*NL*
speechless
astonishment
.
``
Some
nabob
from
India
,
''
was
his
comment
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dantes
,
meanwhile
,
went
on
his
way
.
Each
step
he
trod
oppressed
his
*NL*
heart
with
fresh
emotion
;
his
first
and
most
indelible
recollections
*NL*
were
there
;
not
a
tree
,
not
a
street
,
that
he
passed
but
seemed
filled
*NL*
with
dear
and
cherished
memories
.
And
thus
he
proceeded
onwards
till
he
*NL*
arrived
at
the
end
of
the
Rue
de
Noailles
,
from
whence
a
full
view
of
*NL*
the
Allees
de
Meillan
was
obtained
.
At
this
spot
,
so
pregnant
with
fond
*NL*
and
filial
remembrances
,
his
heart
beat
almost
to
bursting
,
his
knees
*NL*
tottered
under
him
,
a
mist
floated
over
his
sight
,
and
had
he
not
clung
*NL*
for
support
to
one
of
the
trees
,
he
would
inevitably
have
fallen
to
the
*NL*
ground
and
been
crushed
beneath
the
many
vehicles
continually
passing
*NL*
there
.
Recovering
himself
,
however
,
he
wiped
the
perspiration
from
his
*NL*
brows
,
and
stopped
not
again
till
he
found
himself
at
the
door
of
the
*NL*
house
in
which
his
father
had
lived
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
nasturtiums
and
other
plants
,
which
his
father
had
delighted
to
*NL*
train
before
his
window
,
had
all
disappeared
from
the
upper
part
of
the
*NL*
house
.
Leaning
against
the
tree
,
he
gazed
thoughtfully
for
a
time
at
the
*NL*
upper
stories
of
the
shabby
little
house
.
Then
he
advanced
to
the
door
,
*NL*
and
asked
whether
there
were
any
rooms
to
be
let
.
Though
answered
in
the
*NL*
negative
,
he
begged
so
earnestly
to
be
permitted
to
visit
those
on
*NL*
the
fifth
floor
,
that
,
in
despite
of
the
oft-repeated
assurance
of
the
*NL*
concierge
that
they
were
occupied
,
Dantes
succeeded
in
inducing
the
*NL*
man
to
go
up
to
the
tenants
,
and
ask
permission
for
a
gentleman
to
be
*NL*
allowed
to
look
at
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
tenants
of
the
humble
lodging
were
a
young
couple
who
had
been
*NL*
scarcely
married
a
week
;
and
seeing
them
,
Dantes
sighed
heavily
.
Nothing
*NL*
in
the
two
small
chambers
forming
the
apartments
remained
as
it
had
been
*NL*
in
the
time
of
the
elder
Dantes
;
the
very
paper
was
different
,
while
the
*NL*
articles
of
antiquated
furniture
with
which
the
rooms
had
been
filled
in
*NL*
Edmond
's
time
had
all
disappeared
;
the
four
walls
alone
remained
as
he
*NL*
had
left
them
.
The
bed
belonging
to
the
present
occupants
was
placed
as
*NL*
the
former
owner
of
the
chamber
had
been
accustomed
to
have
his
;
and
,
in
*NL*
spite
of
his
efforts
to
prevent
it
,
the
eyes
of
Edmond
were
suffused
*NL*
in
tears
as
he
reflected
that
on
that
spot
the
old
man
had
breathed
*NL*
his
last
,
vainly
calling
for
his
son
.
The
young
couple
gazed
with
*NL*
astonishment
at
the
sight
of
their
visitor
's
emotion
,
and
wondered
to
*NL*
see
the
large
tears
silently
chasing
each
other
down
his
otherwise
stern
*NL*
and
immovable
features
;
but
they
felt
the
sacredness
of
his
grief
,
*NL*
and
kindly
refrained
from
questioning
him
as
to
its
cause
,
while
,
with
*NL*
instinctive
delicacy
,
they
left
him
to
indulge
his
sorrow
alone
.
When
*NL*
he
withdrew
from
the
scene
of
his
painful
recollections
,
they
both
*NL*
accompanied
him
downstairs
,
reiterating
their
hope
that
he
would
come
*NL*
again
whenever
he
pleased
,
and
assuring
him
that
their
poor
dwelling
*NL*
would
ever
be
open
to
him
.
As
Edmond
passed
the
door
on
the
fourth
*NL*
floor
,
he
paused
to
inquire
whether
Caderousse
the
tailor
still
dwelt
*NL*
there
;
but
he
received
,
for
reply
,
that
the
person
in
question
had
got
*NL*
into
difficulties
,
and
at
the
present
time
kept
a
small
inn
on
the
route
*NL*
from
Bellegarde
to
Beaucaire
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
obtained
the
address
of
the
person
to
whom
the
house
in
the
*NL*
Allees
de
Meillan
belonged
,
Dantes
next
proceeded
thither
,
and
,
under
*NL*
the
name
of
Lord
Wilmore
-LRB-
the
name
and
title
inscribed
on
his
passport
-RRB-
,
*NL*
purchased
the
small
dwelling
for
the
sum
of
twenty-five
thousand
francs
,
*NL*
at
least
ten
thousand
more
than
it
was
worth
;
but
had
its
owner
asked
*NL*
half
a
million
,
it
would
unhesitatingly
have
been
given
.
The
very
same
*NL*
day
the
occupants
of
the
apartments
on
the
fifth
floor
of
the
house
,
now
*NL*
become
the
property
of
Dantes
,
were
duly
informed
by
the
notary
who
had
*NL*
arranged
the
necessary
transfer
of
deeds
,
etc.
,
that
the
new
landlord
*NL*
gave
them
their
choice
of
any
of
the
rooms
in
the
house
,
without
the
*NL*
least
augmentation
of
rent
,
upon
condition
of
their
giving
instant
*NL*
possession
of
the
two
small
chambers
they
at
present
inhabited
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
strange
event
aroused
great
wonder
and
curiosity
in
the
*NL*
neighborhood
of
the
Allees
de
Meillan
,
and
a
multitude
of
theories
*NL*
were
afloat
,
none
of
which
was
anywhere
near
the
truth
.
But
what
raised
*NL*
public
astonishment
to
a
climax
,
and
set
all
conjecture
at
defiance
,
was
*NL*
the
knowledge
that
the
same
stranger
who
had
in
the
morning
visited
the
*NL*
Allees
de
Meillan
had
been
seen
in
the
evening
walking
in
the
little
*NL*
village
of
the
Catalans
,
and
afterwards
observed
to
enter
a
poor
*NL*
fisherman
's
hut
,
and
to
pass
more
than
an
hour
in
inquiring
after
*NL*
persons
who
had
either
been
dead
or
gone
away
for
more
than
fifteen
or
*NL*
sixteen
years
.
But
on
the
following
day
the
family
from
whom
all
these
*NL*
particulars
had
been
asked
received
a
handsome
present
,
consisting
of
an
*NL*
entirely
new
fishing-boat
,
with
two
seines
and
a
tender
.
The
delighted
*NL*
recipients
of
these
munificent
gifts
would
gladly
have
poured
out
*NL*
their
thanks
to
their
generous
benefactor
,
but
they
had
seen
him
,
*NL*
upon
quitting
the
hut
,
merely
give
some
orders
to
a
sailor
,
and
then
*NL*
springing
lightly
on
horseback
,
leave
Marseilles
by
the
Porte
d'Aix
.

Chapter
26
.
The
Pont
du
Gard
Inn
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
of
my
readers
as
have
made
a
pedestrian
excursion
to
the
south
*NL*
of
France
may
perchance
have
noticed
,
about
midway
between
the
town
of
*NL*
Beaucaire
and
the
village
of
Bellegarde
,
--
a
little
nearer
to
the
former
*NL*
than
to
the
latter
,
--
a
small
roadside
inn
,
from
the
front
of
which
*NL*
hung
,
creaking
and
flapping
in
the
wind
,
a
sheet
of
tin
covered
with
*NL*
a
grotesque
representation
of
the
Pont
du
Gard
.
This
modern
place
of
*NL*
entertainment
stood
on
the
left-hand
side
of
the
post
road
,
and
backed
*NL*
upon
the
Rhone
.
It
also
boasted
of
what
in
Languedoc
is
styled
a
garden
,
*NL*
consisting
of
a
small
plot
of
ground
,
on
the
side
opposite
to
the
main
*NL*
entrance
reserved
for
the
reception
of
guests
.
A
few
dingy
olives
and
*NL*
stunted
fig-trees
struggled
hard
for
existence
,
but
their
withered
dusty
*NL*
foliage
abundantly
proved
how
unequal
was
the
conflict
.
Between
these
*NL*
sickly
shrubs
grew
a
scanty
supply
of
garlic
,
tomatoes
,
and
eschalots
;
*NL*
while
,
lone
and
solitary
,
like
a
forgotten
sentinel
,
a
tall
pine
raised
*NL*
its
melancholy
head
in
one
of
the
corners
of
this
unattractive
spot
,
and
*NL*
displayed
its
flexible
stem
and
fan-shaped
summit
dried
and
cracked
by
*NL*
the
fierce
heat
of
the
sub-tropical
sun
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
surrounding
plain
,
which
more
resembled
a
dusty
lake
than
solid
*NL*
ground
,
were
scattered
a
few
miserable
stalks
of
wheat
,
the
effect
,
*NL*
no
doubt
,
of
a
curious
desire
on
the
part
of
the
agriculturists
of
the
*NL*
country
to
see
whether
such
a
thing
as
the
raising
of
grain
in
those
*NL*
parched
regions
was
practicable
.
Each
stalk
served
as
a
perch
for
a
*NL*
grasshopper
,
which
regaled
the
passers
by
through
this
Egyptian
scene
*NL*
with
its
strident
,
monotonous
note
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
about
seven
or
eight
years
the
little
tavern
had
been
kept
by
a
man
*NL*
and
his
wife
,
with
two
servants
,
--
a
chambermaid
named
Trinette
,
and
*NL*
a
hostler
called
Pecaud
.
This
small
staff
was
quite
equal
to
all
*NL*
the
requirements
,
for
a
canal
between
Beaucaire
and
Aiguemortes
had
*NL*
revolutionized
transportation
by
substituting
boats
for
the
cart
and
*NL*
the
stagecoach
.
And
,
as
though
to
add
to
the
daily
misery
which
this
*NL*
prosperous
canal
inflicted
on
the
unfortunate
inn-keeper
,
whose
utter
*NL*
ruin
it
was
fast
accomplishing
,
it
was
situated
between
the
Rhone
from
*NL*
which
it
had
its
source
and
the
post-road
it
had
depleted
,
not
a
*NL*
hundred
steps
from
the
inn
,
of
which
we
have
given
a
brief
but
faithful
*NL*
description
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
inn-keeper
himself
was
a
man
of
from
forty
to
fifty-five
years
of
*NL*
age
,
tall
,
strong
,
and
bony
,
a
perfect
specimen
of
the
natives
of
those
*NL*
southern
latitudes
;
he
had
dark
,
sparkling
,
and
deep-set
eyes
,
hooked
*NL*
nose
,
and
teeth
white
as
those
of
a
carnivorous
animal
;
his
hair
,
like
*NL*
his
beard
,
which
he
wore
under
his
chin
,
was
thick
and
curly
,
and
in
*NL*
spite
of
his
age
but
slightly
interspersed
with
a
few
silvery
threads
.
*NL*
His
naturally
dark
complexion
had
assumed
a
still
further
shade
of
brown
*NL*
from
the
habit
the
unfortunate
man
had
acquired
of
stationing
himself
*NL*
from
morning
till
eve
at
the
threshold
of
his
door
,
on
the
lookout
for
*NL*
guests
who
seldom
came
,
yet
there
he
stood
,
day
after
day
,
exposed
to
*NL*
the
meridional
rays
of
a
burning
sun
,
with
no
other
protection
for
his
*NL*
head
than
a
red
handkerchief
twisted
around
it
,
after
the
manner
of
*NL*
the
Spanish
muleteers
.
This
man
was
our
old
acquaintance
,
Gaspard
*NL*
Caderousse
.
His
wife
,
on
the
contrary
,
whose
maiden
name
had
been
*NL*
Madeleine
Radelle
,
was
pale
,
meagre
,
and
sickly-looking
.
Born
in
the
*NL*
neighborhood
of
Arles
,
she
had
shared
in
the
beauty
for
which
its
women
*NL*
are
proverbial
;
but
that
beauty
had
gradually
withered
beneath
the
*NL*
devastating
influence
of
the
slow
fever
so
prevalent
among
dwellers
*NL*
by
the
ponds
of
Aiguemortes
and
the
marshes
of
Camargue
.
She
remained
*NL*
nearly
always
in
her
second-floor
chamber
,
shivering
in
her
chair
,
or
*NL*
stretched
languid
and
feeble
on
her
bed
,
while
her
husband
kept
his
*NL*
daily
watch
at
the
door
--
a
duty
he
performed
with
so
much
the
greater
*NL*
willingness
,
as
it
saved
him
the
necessity
of
listening
to
the
endless
*NL*
plaints
and
murmurs
of
his
helpmate
,
who
never
saw
him
without
breaking
*NL*
out
into
bitter
invectives
against
fate
;
to
all
of
which
her
husband
*NL*
would
calmly
return
an
unvarying
reply
,
in
these
philosophic
words
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hush
,
La
Carconte
.
It
is
God
's
pleasure
that
things
should
be
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
sobriquet
of
La
Carconte
had
been
bestowed
on
Madeleine
Radelle
*NL*
from
the
fact
that
she
had
been
born
in
a
village
,
so
called
,
situated
*NL*
between
Salon
and
Lambesc
;
and
as
a
custom
existed
among
the
inhabitants
*NL*
of
that
part
of
France
where
Caderousse
lived
of
styling
every
person
by
*NL*
some
particular
and
distinctive
appellation
,
her
husband
had
bestowed
on
*NL*
her
the
name
of
La
Carconte
in
place
of
her
sweet
and
euphonious
name
of
*NL*
Madeleine
,
which
,
in
all
probability
,
his
rude
gutteral
language
would
*NL*
not
have
enabled
him
to
pronounce
.
Still
,
let
it
not
be
supposed
*NL*
that
amid
this
affected
resignation
to
the
will
of
Providence
,
the
*NL*
unfortunate
inn-keeper
did
not
writhe
under
the
double
misery
of
seeing
*NL*
the
hateful
canal
carry
off
his
customers
and
his
profits
,
and
the
daily
*NL*
infliction
of
his
peevish
partner
's
murmurs
and
lamentations
.
*NL*
*NL*
Like
other
dwellers
in
the
south
,
he
was
a
man
of
sober
habits
and
*NL*
moderate
desires
,
but
fond
of
external
show
,
vain
,
and
addicted
to
*NL*
display
.
During
the
days
of
his
prosperity
,
not
a
festivity
took
place
*NL*
without
himself
and
wife
being
among
the
spectators
.
He
dressed
in
the
*NL*
picturesque
costume
worn
upon
grand
occasions
by
the
inhabitants
of
the
*NL*
south
of
France
,
bearing
equal
resemblance
to
the
style
adopted
both
by
*NL*
the
Catalans
and
Andalusians
;
while
La
Carconte
displayed
the
charming
*NL*
fashion
prevalent
among
the
women
of
Arles
,
a
mode
of
attire
borrowed
*NL*
equally
from
Greece
and
Arabia
.
But
,
by
degrees
,
watch-chains
,
*NL*
necklaces
,
parti-colored
scarfs
,
embroidered
bodices
,
velvet
vests
,
*NL*
elegantly
worked
stockings
,
striped
gaiters
,
and
silver
buckles
for
the
*NL*
shoes
,
all
disappeared
;
and
Gaspard
Caderousse
,
unable
to
appear
abroad
*NL*
in
his
pristine
splendor
,
had
given
up
any
further
participation
in
the
*NL*
pomps
and
vanities
,
both
for
himself
and
wife
,
although
a
bitter
feeling
*NL*
of
envious
discontent
filled
his
mind
as
the
sound
of
mirth
and
merry
*NL*
music
from
the
joyous
revellers
reached
even
the
miserable
hostelry
to
*NL*
which
he
still
clung
,
more
for
the
shelter
than
the
profit
it
afforded
.
*NL*
*NL*
Caderousse
,
then
,
was
,
as
usual
,
at
his
place
of
observation
before
*NL*
the
door
,
his
eyes
glancing
listlessly
from
a
piece
of
closely
shaven
*NL*
grass
--
on
which
some
fowls
were
industriously
,
though
fruitlessly
,
*NL*
endeavoring
to
turn
up
some
grain
or
insect
suited
to
their
palate
--
to
*NL*
the
deserted
road
,
which
led
away
to
the
north
and
south
,
when
he
was
*NL*
aroused
by
the
shrill
voice
of
his
wife
,
and
grumbling
to
himself
as
he
*NL*
went
,
he
mounted
to
her
chamber
,
first
taking
care
,
however
,
to
set
the
*NL*
entrance
door
wide
open
,
as
an
invitation
to
any
chance
traveller
who
*NL*
might
be
passing
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
moment
Caderousse
quitted
his
sentry-like
watch
before
the
door
,
*NL*
the
road
on
which
he
so
eagerly
strained
his
sight
was
void
and
*NL*
lonely
as
a
desert
at
mid-day
.
There
it
lay
stretching
out
into
one
*NL*
interminable
line
of
dust
and
sand
,
with
its
sides
bordered
by
tall
,
*NL*
meagre
trees
,
altogether
presenting
so
uninviting
an
appearance
,
that
no
*NL*
one
in
his
senses
could
have
imagined
that
any
traveller
,
at
liberty
*NL*
to
regulate
his
hours
for
journeying
,
would
choose
to
expose
himself
in
*NL*
such
a
formidable
Sahara
.
Nevertheless
,
had
Caderousse
but
retained
*NL*
his
post
a
few
minutes
longer
,
he
might
have
caught
a
dim
outline
of
*NL*
something
approaching
from
the
direction
of
Bellegarde
;
as
the
moving
*NL*
object
drew
nearer
,
he
would
easily
have
perceived
that
it
consisted
of
*NL*
a
man
and
horse
,
between
whom
the
kindest
and
most
amiable
understanding
*NL*
appeared
to
exist
.
The
horse
was
of
Hungarian
breed
,
and
ambled
along
*NL*
at
an
easy
pace
.
His
rider
was
a
priest
,
dressed
in
black
,
and
wearing
a
*NL*
three-cornered
hat
;
and
,
spite
of
the
ardent
rays
of
a
noonday
sun
,
the
*NL*
pair
came
on
with
a
fair
degree
of
rapidity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
arrived
before
the
Pont
du
Gard
,
the
horse
stopped
,
but
whether
*NL*
for
his
own
pleasure
or
that
of
his
rider
would
have
been
difficult
*NL*
to
say
.
However
that
might
have
been
,
the
priest
,
dismounting
,
led
his
*NL*
steed
by
the
bridle
in
search
of
some
place
to
which
he
could
secure
*NL*
him
.
Availing
himself
of
a
handle
that
projected
from
a
half-fallen
*NL*
door
,
he
tied
the
animal
safely
and
having
drawn
a
red
cotton
*NL*
handkerchief
,
from
his
pocket
,
wiped
away
the
perspiration
that
streamed
*NL*
from
his
brow
,
then
,
advancing
to
the
door
,
struck
thrice
with
the
end
*NL*
of
his
iron-shod
stick
.
At
this
unusual
sound
,
a
huge
black
dog
came
*NL*
rushing
to
meet
the
daring
assailant
of
his
ordinarily
tranquil
*NL*
abode
,
snarling
and
displaying
his
sharp
white
teeth
with
a
determined
*NL*
hostility
that
abundantly
proved
how
little
he
was
accustomed
to
*NL*
society
.
At
that
moment
a
heavy
footstep
was
heard
descending
the
*NL*
wooden
staircase
that
led
from
the
upper
floor
,
and
,
with
many
bows
and
*NL*
courteous
smiles
,
mine
host
of
the
Pont
du
Gard
besought
his
guest
to
*NL*
enter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
welcome
,
sir
,
most
welcome
!
''
repeated
the
astonished
*NL*
Caderousse
.
``
Now
,
then
,
Margotin
,
''
cried
he
,
speaking
to
the
dog
,
``
will
*NL*
you
be
quiet
?
Pray
do
n't
heed
him
,
sir
!
--
he
only
barks
,
he
never
bites
.
*NL*
I
make
no
doubt
a
glass
of
good
wine
would
be
acceptable
this
dreadfully
*NL*
hot
day
.
''
Then
perceiving
for
the
first
time
the
garb
of
the
traveller
*NL*
he
had
to
entertain
,
Caderousse
hastily
exclaimed
:
``
A
thousand
pardons
!
*NL*
I
really
did
not
observe
whom
I
had
the
honor
to
receive
under
my
poor
*NL*
roof
.
What
would
the
abbe
please
to
have
?
What
refreshment
can
I
offer
?
*NL*
All
I
have
is
at
his
service
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
priest
gazed
on
the
person
addressing
him
with
a
long
and
searching
*NL*
gaze
--
there
even
seemed
a
disposition
on
his
part
to
court
a
similar
*NL*
scrutiny
on
the
part
of
the
inn-keeper
;
then
,
observing
in
the
*NL*
countenance
of
the
latter
no
other
expression
than
extreme
surprise
at
*NL*
his
own
want
of
attention
to
an
inquiry
so
courteously
worded
,
he
deemed
*NL*
it
as
well
to
terminate
this
dumb
show
,
and
therefore
said
,
speaking
*NL*
with
a
strong
Italian
accent
,
``
You
are
,
I
presume
,
M.
Caderousse
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
,
''
answered
the
host
,
even
more
surprised
at
the
question
*NL*
than
he
had
been
by
the
silence
which
had
preceded
it
;
``
I
am
Gaspard
*NL*
Caderousse
,
at
your
service
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gaspard
Caderousse
,
''
rejoined
the
priest
.
``
Yes
,
--
Christian
and
surname
*NL*
are
the
same
.
You
formerly
lived
,
I
believe
in
the
Allees
de
Meillan
,
on
*NL*
the
fourth
floor
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
followed
the
business
of
a
tailor
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
True
,
I
was
a
tailor
,
till
the
trade
fell
off
.
It
is
so
hot
at
*NL*
Marseilles
,
that
really
I
believe
that
the
respectable
inhabitants
will
*NL*
in
time
go
without
any
clothing
whatever
.
But
talking
of
heat
,
is
there
*NL*
nothing
I
can
offer
you
by
way
of
refreshment
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
let
me
have
a
bottle
of
your
best
wine
,
and
then
,
with
your
*NL*
permission
,
we
will
resume
our
conversation
from
where
we
left
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
you
please
,
sir
,
''
said
Caderousse
,
who
,
anxious
not
to
lose
the
*NL*
present
opportunity
of
finding
a
customer
for
one
of
the
few
bottles
of
*NL*
Cahors
still
remaining
in
his
possession
,
hastily
raised
a
trap-door
in
*NL*
the
floor
of
the
apartment
they
were
in
,
which
served
both
as
parlor
*NL*
and
kitchen
.
Upon
issuing
forth
from
his
subterranean
retreat
at
the
*NL*
expiration
of
five
minutes
,
he
found
the
abbe
seated
upon
a
wooden
*NL*
stool
,
leaning
his
elbow
on
a
table
,
while
Margotin
,
whose
animosity
*NL*
seemed
appeased
by
the
unusual
command
of
the
traveller
for
*NL*
refreshments
,
had
crept
up
to
him
,
and
had
established
himself
very
*NL*
comfortably
between
his
knees
,
his
long
,
skinny
neck
resting
on
his
lap
,
*NL*
while
his
dim
eye
was
fixed
earnestly
on
the
traveller
's
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
quite
alone
?
''
inquired
the
guest
,
as
Caderousse
placed
before
*NL*
him
the
bottle
of
wine
and
a
glass
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
,
quite
alone
,
''
replied
the
man
--
``
or
,
at
least
,
practically
so
,
*NL*
for
my
poor
wife
,
who
is
the
only
person
in
the
house
besides
myself
,
is
*NL*
laid
up
with
illness
,
and
unable
to
render
me
the
least
assistance
,
poor
*NL*
thing
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
married
,
then
?
''
said
the
priest
,
with
a
show
of
interest
,
*NL*
glancing
round
as
he
spoke
at
the
scanty
furnishings
of
the
apartment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
sir
,
''
said
Caderousse
with
a
sigh
,
``
it
is
easy
to
perceive
I
am
not
*NL*
a
rich
man
;
but
in
this
world
a
man
does
not
thrive
the
better
for
being
*NL*
honest
.
''
The
abbe
fixed
on
him
a
searching
,
penetrating
glance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
honest
--
I
can
certainly
say
that
much
for
myself
,
''
continued
the
*NL*
inn-keeper
,
fairly
sustaining
the
scrutiny
of
the
abbe
's
gaze
;
``
I
*NL*
can
boast
with
truth
of
being
an
honest
man
;
and
,
''
continued
he
*NL*
significantly
,
with
a
hand
on
his
breast
and
shaking
his
head
,
``
that
is
*NL*
more
than
every
one
can
say
nowadays
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
much
the
better
for
you
,
if
what
you
assert
be
true
,
''
said
the
*NL*
abbe
;
``
for
I
am
firmly
persuaded
that
,
sooner
or
later
,
the
good
will
be
*NL*
rewarded
,
and
the
wicked
punished
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Such
words
as
those
belong
to
your
profession
,
''
answered
Caderousse
,
*NL*
``
and
you
do
well
to
repeat
them
;
but
,
''
added
he
,
with
a
bitter
*NL*
expression
of
countenance
,
``
one
is
free
to
believe
them
or
not
,
as
one
*NL*
pleases
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
wrong
to
speak
thus
,
''
said
the
abbe
;
``
and
perhaps
I
may
,
in
my
*NL*
own
person
,
be
able
to
prove
to
you
how
completely
you
are
in
error
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
mean
you
?
''
inquired
Caderousse
with
a
look
of
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
first
place
,
I
must
be
satisfied
that
you
are
the
person
I
am
in
*NL*
search
of
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
proofs
do
you
require
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
,
in
the
year
1814
or
1815
,
know
anything
of
a
young
sailor
*NL*
named
Dantes
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dantes
?
Did
I
know
poor
dear
Edmond
?
Why
,
Edmond
Dantes
and
myself
*NL*
were
intimate
friends
!
''
exclaimed
Caderousse
,
whose
countenance
flushed
*NL*
darkly
as
he
caught
the
penetrating
gaze
of
the
abbe
fixed
on
him
,
while
*NL*
the
clear
,
calm
eye
of
the
questioner
seemed
to
dilate
with
feverish
*NL*
scrutiny
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
remind
me
,
''
said
the
priest
,
``
that
the
young
man
concerning
whom
I
*NL*
asked
you
was
said
to
bear
the
name
of
Edmond
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Said
to
bear
the
name
!
''
repeated
Caderousse
,
becoming
excited
and
*NL*
eager
.
``
Why
,
he
was
so
called
as
truly
as
I
myself
bore
the
appellation
*NL*
of
Gaspard
Caderousse
;
but
tell
me
,
I
pray
,
what
has
become
of
poor
*NL*
Edmond
?
Did
you
know
him
?
Is
he
alive
and
at
liberty
?
Is
he
prosperous
*NL*
and
happy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
died
a
more
wretched
,
hopeless
,
heart-broken
prisoner
than
the
*NL*
felons
who
pay
the
penalty
of
their
crimes
at
the
galleys
of
Toulon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
deadly
pallor
followed
the
flush
on
the
countenance
of
Caderousse
,
who
*NL*
turned
away
,
and
the
priest
saw
him
wiping
the
tears
from
his
eyes
with
*NL*
the
corner
of
the
red
handkerchief
twisted
round
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
fellow
,
poor
fellow
!
''
murmured
Caderousse
.
``
Well
,
there
,
sir
,
is
*NL*
another
proof
that
good
people
are
never
rewarded
on
this
earth
,
and
*NL*
that
none
but
the
wicked
prosper
.
Ah
,

continued
Caderousse
,
speaking
*NL*
in
the
highly
colored
language
of
the
south
,
``
the
world
grows
worse
and
*NL*
worse
.
Why
does
not
God
,
if
he
really
hates
the
wicked
,
as
he
is
said
to
*NL*
do
,
send
down
brimstone
and
fire
,
and
consume
them
altogether
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
speak
as
though
you
had
loved
this
young
Dantes
,

observed
the
*NL*
abbe
,
without
taking
any
notice
of
his
companion
's
vehemence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
so
I
did

replied
Caderousse
;

once

I
confess

I
envied

him
his
good
fortune

I
swear

I
swear

by
*NL*
everything
a
man
holds
dear

I
have
,
since

deeply

sincerely
*NL*
lamented
his
unhappy
fate

There
was
a
brief
silence
,
during
which
*NL*
the
fixed
,
searching
eye
of
the
abbe
was
employed
in
scrutinizing
the
*NL*
agitated
features
of
the
inn-keeper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
knew
the
poor
lad

Caderousse

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

*NL*
*NL*
``
And

asked
Caderousse
in

choking
voice

Caderousse
wiped
away
the
large
beads
of
perspiration
*NL*
that
gathered
on
his
brow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
the
strangest
part
of
the
story
is
,
''
resumed
the
abbe
,
``
that
*NL*
Dantes
,
even
in
his
dying
moments
,
swore
by
his
crucified
Redeemer
,
that
*NL*
he
was
utterly
ignorant
of
the
cause
of
his
detention
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
so
he
was
,
''
murmured
Caderousse
.
``
How
should
he
have
been
*NL*
otherwise
?
Ah
,
sir
,
the
poor
fellow
told
you
the
truth
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
for
that
reason
,
he
besought
me
to
try
and
clear
up
a
mystery
he
*NL*
had
never
been
able
to
penetrate
,
and
to
clear
his
memory
should
any
*NL*
foul
spot
or
stain
have
fallen
on
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
here
the
look
of
the
abbe
,
becoming
more
and
more
fixed
,
seemed
to
*NL*
rest
with
ill-concealed
satisfaction
on
the
gloomy
depression
which
was
*NL*
rapidly
spreading
over
the
countenance
of
Caderousse
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
rich
Englishman
,

continued
the
abbe
,
``
who
had
been
his
companion

in
misfortune

but
had
been
released
from
prison

the
second

restoration
,
was
possessed
of
a
diamond
of
immense
value
;
this
jewel
he
*NL*
bestowed
on
Dantes
upon
himself
quitting
the
prison
,
as
a
mark
of
his
*NL*
gratitude
for
the
kindness
and
brotherly
care
with
which
Dantes
had
*NL*
nursed
him
in
a
severe
illness
he
underwent
during
his
confinement

*NL*
Instead
of
employing
this
diamond
in
attempting
to
bribe
his
jailers
,
*NL*
who
might
only
have
taken
it
and
then
betrayed
him
to
the
governor

*NL*
Dantes
carefully
preserved
it

getting
out
of

prison
he
might
have
wherewithal
to
live

for
the

a
diamond

would
have
quite
sufficed
to
make
his
fortune

*NL*
*NL*
``
Then

I
suppose

asked
Caderousse
,
with
eager
,
glowing
looks
,

that
it

was
a
stone
of
immense
value

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

answered
the
abbe

``
To
one
in
Edmond

position
the
diamond
certainly
was
of

fifty
thousand
francs

*NL*
*NL*
``
Bless

exclaimed
Caderousse

Surely
the

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

replied
the

``
it
was
not
of

it
with
me

*NL*
*NL*
The
sharp
gaze
of
Caderousse
was
instantly
directed
towards
the
priest

*NL*
garments
,
as
though
hoping
to
discover
the
location
of
the
treasure

*NL*
Calmly
drawing
forth
from
his
pocket
a
small
box
covered
with
black
*NL*
shagreen
,
the
abbe
opened
it
,
and
displayed
to
the
dazzled
eyes
of
*NL*
Caderousse
the
sparkling
jewel
it
contained
,
set
in
a
ring
of
admirable
*NL*
workmanship

``
And
that
diamond

cried
Caderousse
,
almost
breathless
*NL*
with
eager
admiration
,
``
you
say
,
is
worth
fifty
thousand
francs

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is

without
the

valuable

replied
the
abbe
,
*NL*
as
he
closed
the
box
,
and
returned
it
to
his
pocket
,
while
its
brilliant
*NL*
hues
seemed
still
to
dance
before
the
eyes
of
the
fascinated
inn-keeper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
how
comes
the
diamond

said

I
feel

The
inn-keeper

shivered

Another
of

the
abbe

seeming
to

called

the

sincere
affection

A
*NL*
fiendish
smile
played
over
the
features
of
Caderousse

who
was
about
to
*NL*
break
in
upon
the
abbe

speech

when
the

waving
his

*NL*
Caderousse
quickly
performed
the
stranger

bidding

after
pouring

some
into
a
glass
,

slowly
swallowing
its
contents
,
the
abbe
,
*NL*
resuming
his
usual
placidity

said

he
placed

on

Caderousse
paused

*NL*
*NL*
``
Of

asked
the
priest

anxiously

eagerly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

starvation

*NL*
*NL*
``
Starvation

exclaimed
the
abbe

springing
from
his
seat
.
``
Why

vilest
animals

not

die

a
death

houseless

homeless
in

streets
find
some
pitying

hand
to
cast

a
mouthful

bread

be
allowed
to
perish
of
hunger

horrible

utterly
impossible

*NL*
``
What
I

Caderousse

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
are
a
fool
for

anything

said
a
voice
*NL*
from
the
top
of
the
stairs
.
``
Why
should
you
meddle
with
what
does
not
*NL*
concern
you

*NL*
The
two
men
turned
quickly
,
and
saw
the
sickly
countenance
of
La
*NL*
Carconte
peering
between
the
baluster
rails
;
attracted
by
the
sound
of
*NL*
voices
,
she
had
feebly
dragged
herself
down
the
stairs
,
and
,
seated
*NL*
on
the
lower
step
,
head
on
knees

she
had
listened
to
the
foregoing
*NL*
conversation

``
Mind
your

Caderousse

sharply

La

prudence

the

at

La

a

inarticulate
words

then
let
her
head
again

drop
upon
her
knees

went
into
a
fit
of
ague

leaving
the
two
*NL*
speakers
to
resume
the
conversation

remaining
so
as
to
be
able
to
*NL*
hear
every
word
they
uttered

Again
the
abbe
had
been
obliged
to
swallow
*NL*
a
draught
of
water
to
calm
the
emotions
that
threatened
to
overpower
*NL*
him

When
he
had
sufficiently
recovered
himself

he
said
,

dreadful
a

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

he
was
not
altogether
forsaken

continued
Caderousse
,
``

contracted
a
profound
hatred

added
Caderousse
with
a
bitter
smile

*NL*
``

no

irritated

the
interruption

addressing

honorable

Caderousse

in

that
I
should
bestow
on

treacherous

reward
intended

faithful

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
true
enough
,
''
returned
Caderousse
.
``
You
say
truly
,
the
gift
*NL*
of
poor
Edmond
was
not
meant
for
such
traitors
as
Fernand
and
Danglars
;
*NL*
besides
,
what
would
it
be
to
them
?
no
more
than
a
drop
of
water
in
the
*NL*
ocean
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Remember
,
''
chimed
in
La
Carconte
,
``
those
two
could
crush
you
at
a
*NL*
single
blow
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
How
so
?
''
inquired
the
abbe
.
``
Are
these
persons
,
then
,
so
rich
and
*NL*
powerful
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
not
know
their
history
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
.
Pray
relate
it
to
me
!
''
Caderousse
seemed
to
reflect
for
a
few
*NL*
moments
,
then
said
,
``
No
,
truly
,
it
would
take
up
too
much
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
my
good
friend
,
''
returned
the
abbe
,
in
a
tone
that
indicated
*NL*
utter
indifference
on
his
part
,
``
you
are
at
liberty

either
to
speak

*NL*
be
silent

just
as
you
please

I
respect
your
scruples
*NL*
and
admire
your
sentiments

so
let
the
matter
end
.
I
shall
do
my
duty
*NL*
as
conscientiously
as
I
can
,
and
fulfil
my
promise
to
the
dying
man
.
My
*NL*
first
business
will
be
to
dispose
of
this
diamond
.
''
So
saying
,
the
abbe
*NL*
again
draw
the
small
box
from
his
pocket
,
opened
it
,
and
contrived
to
*NL*
hold
it
in
such
a
light
,
that
a
bright
flash
of
brilliant
hues
passed
*NL*
before
the
dazzled
gaze
of
Caderousse
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wife
,
wife
!
''
cried
he
in
a
hoarse
voice
,
``
come
here
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Diamond
!
''
exclaimed
La
Carconte
,
rising
and
descending
to
the
chamber
*NL*
with
a
tolerably
firm
step
;
``
what
diamond
are
you
talking
about
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
did
you
not
hear
all
we
said
?
''
inquired
Caderousse
.
``
It
is
a
*NL*
beautiful
diamond
left
by
poor
Edmond
Dantes
,
to
be
sold
,
and
the
money
*NL*
divided
between
his
father
,
Mercedes
,
his
betrothed
bride
,
Fernand
,
*NL*
Danglars
,
and
myself
.
The
jewel
is
worth
at
least
fifty
thousand
*NL*
francs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
what
a
magnificent
jewel
!
''
cried
the
astonished
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
fifth
part
of
the
profits
from
this
stone
belongs
to
us
then
,
does
*NL*
it
not
?
''
asked
Caderousse
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
does
,
''
replied
the
abbe
;
``
with
the
addition
of
an
equal
division
*NL*
of
that
part
intended
for
the
elder
Dantes
,
which
I
believe
myself
at
*NL*
liberty
to
divide
equally
with
the
four
survivors
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
why
among
us
four
?
''
inquired
Caderousse
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
being
the
friends
Edmond
esteemed
most
faithful
and
devoted
to
him

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
call
those
friends
who
betray
and
ruin
you

''
murmured
the
wife
*NL*
in
her
turn
,
in
a
low
,
muttering
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
not
!
''
rejoined
Caderousse
quickly
;
``
no
more
do
I
,
and
that
*NL*
was
what
I
was
observing
to
this
gentleman
just
now
.
I
said
I
looked
*NL*
upon
it
as
a
sacrilegious
profanation
to
reward
treachery
,
perhaps
*NL*
crime
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Remember
,
''
answered
the
abbe
calmly
,
as
he
replaced
the
jewel
and
its
*NL*
case
in
the
pocket
of
his
cassock
,
``
it
is
your
fault
,
not
mine
,
that
I
*NL*
do
so
.
You
will
have
the
goodness
to
furnish
me
with
the
address
of
both
*NL*
Fernand
and
Danglars
,
in
order
that
I
may
execute
Edmond
's
last
*NL*
wishes
.
''
The
agitation
of
Caderousse
became
extreme
,
and
large
drops
of
*NL*
perspiration
rolled
from
his
heated
brow
.
As
he
saw
the
abbe
rise
from
*NL*
his
seat
and
go
towards
the
door
,
as
though
to
ascertain
if
his
horse
*NL*
were
sufficiently
refreshed
to
continue
his
journey
,
Caderousse
and
his
*NL*
wife
exchanged
looks
of
deep
meaning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
you
see
,
wife
,
''
said
the
former
,
``
this
splendid
diamond
might
*NL*
all
be
ours
,
if
we
chose
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
believe
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
surely
a
man
of
his
holy
profession
would
not
deceive
us
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
replied
La
Carconte
,
``
do
as
you
like
.
For
my
part
,
I
wash
my
*NL*
hands
of
the
affair
.
''
So
saying
,
she
once
more
climbed
the
staircase
*NL*
leading
to
her
chamber
,
her
body
convulsed
with
chills
,
and
her
teeth
*NL*
rattling
in
her
head
,
in
spite
of
the
intense
heat
of
the
weather
.
*NL*
Arrived
at
the
top
stair
,
she
turned
round
,
and
called
out
,
in
a
warning
*NL*
tone
,
to
her
husband
,
``
Gaspard
,
consider
well
what
you
are
about
to
do
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
both
reflected
and
decided
,
''
answered
he
.
La
Carconte
then
*NL*
entered
her
chamber
,
the
flooring
of
which
creaked
beneath
her
heavy
,
*NL*
uncertain
tread
,
as
she
proceeded
towards
her
arm-chair
,
into
which
she
*NL*
fell
as
though
exhausted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
asked
the
abbe
,
as
he
returned
to
the
apartment
below
,
``
what
*NL*
have
you
made
up
your
mind
to
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
tell
you
all
I
know
,
''
was
the
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
certainly
think
you
act
wisely
in
so
doing
,
''
said
the
priest
.
``
Not
*NL*
because
I
have
the
least
desire
to
learn
anything
you
may
please
to
*NL*
conceal
from
me
,
but
simply
that
if
,
through
your
assistance
,
I
could
*NL*
distribute
the
legacy
according
to
the
wishes
of
the
testator
,
why
,
so
*NL*
much
the
better
,
that
is
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
it
may
be
so
,
''
replied
Caderousse
,
his
face
flushed
with
*NL*
cupidity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
all
attention
,
''
said
the
abbe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stop
a
minute
,
''
answered
Caderousse
;
``
we
might
be
interrupted
in
the
*NL*
most
interesting
part
of
my
story
,
which
would
be
a
pity
;
and
it
is
as
*NL*
well
that
your
visit
hither
should
be
made
known
only
to
ourselves
.
''
*NL*
With
these
words
he
went
stealthily
to
the
door
,
which
he
closed
,
and
,
*NL*
by
way
of
still
greater
precaution
,
bolted
and
barred
it
,
as
he
was
*NL*
accustomed
to
do
at
night
.
During
this
time
the
abbe
had
chosen
his
*NL*
place
for
listening
at
his
ease
.
He
removed
his
seat
into
a
corner
of
*NL*
the
room
,
where
he
himself
would
be
in
deep
shadow
,
while
the
light
*NL*
would
be
fully
thrown
on
the
narrator
;
then
,
with
head
bent
down
and
*NL*
hands
clasped
,
or
rather
clinched
together
,
he
prepared
to
give
his
*NL*
whole
attention
to
Caderousse
,
who
seated
himself
on
the
little
stool
,
*NL*
exactly
opposite
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Remember
,
this
is
no
affair
of
mine
,
''
said
the
trembling
voice
of
La
*NL*
Carconte
,
as
though
through
the
flooring
of
her
chamber
she
viewed
the
*NL*
scene
that
was
enacting
below
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Enough
,
enough
!
''
replied
Caderousse
;
``
say
no
more
about
it
;
I
will
take
*NL*
all
the
consequences
upon
myself
.
''
And
he
began
his
story
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
27
.
The
Story
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
First
,
sir
,
''
said
Caderousse
,
``
you
must
make
me
a
promise
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
that
?
''
inquired
the
abbe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
if
you
ever
make
use
of
the
details
I
am
about
to
give
you
,
that
*NL*
you
will
never
let
any
one
know
that
it
was
I
who
supplied
them
;
for
the
*NL*
persons
of
whom
I
am
about
to
talk
are
rich
and
powerful
,
and
if
they
*NL*
only
laid
the
tips
of
their
fingers
on
me
,
I
should
break
to
pieces
like
*NL*
glass
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Make
yourself
easy
,
my
friend
,
''
replied
the
abbe
.
``
I
am
a
priest
,
and
*NL*
confessions
die
in
my
breast
.
Recollect
,
our
only
desire
is
to
carry
*NL*
out
,
in
a
fitting
manner
,
the
last
wishes
of
our
friend
.
Speak
,
then
,
*NL*
without
reserve
,
as
without
hatred
;
tell
the
truth
,
the
whole
truth
;
I
*NL*
do
not
know
,
never
may
know
,
the
persons
of
whom
you
are
about
to
speak
;
*NL*
besides
,
I
am
an
Italian

not
a
Frenchman

and
belong
to
God
,
and
*NL*
not
to
man

I
shall
shortly
retire
to
my
convent
,
which
I
have
*NL*
only
quitted
to
fulfil
the
last
wishes
of
a
dying
man

This
positive
*NL*
assurance
seemed
to
give
Caderousse
a
little
courage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
under
these
circumstances

said
Caderousse
,
``
I
will

I

even
believe
I
ought

undeceive
you

thought
so
sincere
and
unquestionable

*NL*
*NL*
``
Begin
with
his
father

*NL*
*NL*
``
The
history
is
a

Caderousse

shaking
his
head

*NL*
``
perhaps
you
know
all
the
earlier
part

it

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

answered
the
abbe

Edmond
related

everything

Was

betrothal
feast

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was

the
feast

followed
by
four
soldiers

entered
,

Dantes
was
*NL*
arrested

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

up
to
this
point
I

said
the
priest

``
Dantes
himself
*NL*
only
knew
that
which
personally
concerned
him

he
never
beheld
again
*NL*
the
five
persons
I
have
named
to
you

heard
mention

any
one
of
*NL*
them

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
when
Dantes
was
arrested
,
Monsieur
Morrel
hastened
to
obtain
the
*NL*
particulars
,
and
they
were
very
sad
.
The
old
man
returned
alone
to
his
*NL*
home
,
folded
up
his
wedding
suit
with
tears
in
his
eyes
,
and
paced
up
*NL*
and
down
his
chamber
the
whole
day
,
and
would
not
go
to
bed
at
all
,
*NL*
for
I
was
underneath
him
and
heard
him
walking
the
whole
night
;
and
for
*NL*
myself
,
I
assure
you
I
could
not
sleep
either
,
for
the
grief
of
the
poor
*NL*
father
gave
me
great
uneasiness

and
every
step
he
took
went
to
my
heart
*NL*
as
really
as
if
his
foot
had
pressed
against
my
breast

The
next
day
*NL*
Mercedes
came
to
implore
the
protection
of
M.
de
Villefort
;
she
did
not
*NL*
obtain
it
,
however
,
and
went
to
visit
the
old
man
;
when
she
saw
him
so
*NL*
miserable
and
heart-broken
,
having
passed
a
sleepless
night
,
and
not
*NL*
touched
food
since
the
previous
day
,
she
wished
him
to
go
with
her
that
*NL*
she
might
take
care
of
him
;
but
the
old
man
would
not
consent
.
`
No

was
*NL*
the
old
man
's
reply
,
'
I
will
not
leave
this
house
,
for
my
poor
dear
boy
*NL*
loves
me
better
than
anything
in
the
world
;
and
if
he
gets
out
of
prison
*NL*
he
will
come
and
see
me
the
first
thing
,
and
what
would
he
think
if
I
*NL*
did
not
wait
here
for
him
?
'
I
heard
all
this
from
the
window
,
for
I
was
*NL*
anxious
that
Mercedes
should
persuade
the
old
man
to
accompany
her
,
for
*NL*
his
footsteps
over
my
head
night
and
day
did
not
leave
me
a
moment

*NL*
repose

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
did
you
not
go
up-stairs
and
try
to
console
the
poor

asked
the
abbe

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

sir

Caderousse

we
can
not
console
those
who
will
not

he
was
one
of
these

,
I
know
not
why
,

he
*NL*
seemed
to
dislike
seeing
me
.
One
night
,
however
,
I
heard
his
sobs
,
and
I
*NL*
could
not
resist
my
desire
to
go
up
to
him
,
but
when
I
reached
his
door
*NL*
he
was
no

weeping

praying

I
can
not
now
repeat
to
you
,
sir

*NL*
all
the
eloquent
words

imploring
language
he
made
use
of
;
it
was
*NL*
more
than
piety

it
was
more
than
grief

I
,
who
am
no
canter

*NL*
hate
the
Jesuits

said
then
to
myself

`
It
is
really
well

I
am
very

glad

have
not
any
children

were
a
father

felt
such
*NL*
excessive
grief
as
the
old
man
does
,

did
not
find
in
my
memory

*NL*
heart
all
he
is
now
saying
,
I
should
throw
myself
into
the
sea
at
once

I
could
not
bear
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor

the

From

solitary

M.
*NL*
Morrel
and
Mercedes
came
to
see
him
,
but
his
door
was
closed
;
and
,
*NL*
although
I
was
certain
he
was
at
home
,
he
would
not
make
any
answer
.
*NL*
One
day
,
when
,
contrary
to
his
custom
,
he
had
admitted
Mercedes
,
and
the
*NL*
poor
girl
,
in
spite
of
her
own
grief
and
despair
,
endeavored
to
console
*NL*
him
,
he
said
to
her
,
--
`
Be
assured
,
my
dear
daughter
,
he
is
dead
;
and
*NL*
instead
of
expecting
him
,
it
is
he
who
is
awaiting
us
;
I
am
quite
happy
,
*NL*
for
I
am
the
oldest
,
and
of
course
shall
see
him
first
.
'
However
well
*NL*
disposed
a
person
may
be
,
why
you
see
we
leave
off
after
a
time
seeing
*NL*
persons
who
are
in
sorrow
,
they
make
one
melancholy
;
and
so
at
last
*NL*
old
Dantes
was
left
all
to
himself
,
and
I
only
saw
from
time
to
time
*NL*
strangers
go
up
to
him
and
come
down
again
with
some
bundle
they
tried
*NL*
to
hide
;
but
I
guessed
what
these
bundles
were
,
and
that
he
sold
by
*NL*
degrees
what
he
had
to
pay
for
his
subsistence
.
At
length
the
poor
old
*NL*
fellow
reached
the
end
of
all
he
had
;
he
owed
three
quarters
'
rent
,
and
*NL*
they
threatened
to
turn
him
out
;
he
begged
for
another
week
,
which
was
*NL*
granted
to
him
.
I
know
this
,
because
the
landlord
came
into
my
apartment
*NL*
when
he
left
his
.
For
the
first
three
days
I
heard
him
walking
about
as
*NL*
usual
,
but
,
on
the
fourth
I
heard
nothing
.
I
then
resolved
to
go
up
to
*NL*
him
at
all
risks
.
The
door
was
closed
,
but
I
looked
through
the
keyhole
,
*NL*
and
saw
him
so
pale
and
haggard
,
that
believing
him
very
ill
,
I
went
and
*NL*
told
M.
Morrel
and
then
ran
on
to
Mercedes
.
They
both
came
immediately
,
*NL*
M.
Morrel
bringing
a
doctor
,
and
the
doctor
said
it
was
inflammation
*NL*
of
the
bowels
,
and
ordered
him
a
limited
diet
.
I
was
there
,
too
,
and
I
*NL*
never
shall
forget
the
old
man
's
smile
at
this
prescription
.
From
that
*NL*
time
he
received
all
who
came
;
he
had
an
excuse
for
not
eating
any
more
;
*NL*
the
doctor
had
put
him
on
a
diet
.
''
The
abbe
uttered
a
kind
of
groan
.
*NL*
``
The
story
interests
you
,
does
it
not
,
sir
?
''
inquired
Caderousse
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
replied
the
abbe
,
``
it
is
very
affecting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mercedes
came
again
,
and
she
found
him
so
altered
that
she
was
even
*NL*
more
anxious
than
before
to
have
him
taken
to
her
own
home
.
This
was
M.
*NL*
Morrel
's
wish
also
,
who
would
fain
have
conveyed
the
old
man
against
his
*NL*
consent
;
but
the
old
man
resisted
,
and
cried
so
that
they
were
actually
*NL*
frightened
.
Mercedes
remained
,
therefore
,
by
his
bedside
,
and
M.
Morrel
*NL*
went
away
,
making
a
sign
to
the
Catalan
that
he
had
left
his
purse
on
*NL*
the
chimney-piece
.
But
availing
himself
of
the
doctor
's
order
,
the
old
*NL*
man
would
not
take
any
sustenance
;
at
length
-LRB-
after
nine
days
of
despair
*NL*
and
fasting
-RRB-
,
the
old
man
died
,
cursing
those
who
had
caused
his
misery
,
*NL*
and
saying
to
Mercedes
,
`
If
you
ever
see
my
Edmond
again
,
tell
him
I
die
*NL*
blessing
him
.
'
''
The
abbe
rose
from
his
chair
,
made
two
turns
round
the
*NL*
chamber
,
and
pressed
his
trembling
hand
against
his
parched
throat
.
``
And
*NL*
you
believe
he
died
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
hunger
,
sir
,
of
hunger

''
said
Caderousse
.
``
I
am
as
certain
of
it
as
*NL*
that
we
two
are
Christians
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
abbe
,
with
a
shaking
hand
,
seized
a
glass
of
water
that
was
standing
*NL*
by
him
half-full
,
swallowed
it
at
one
gulp
,
and
then
resumed
his
seat
,
*NL*
with
red
eyes
and
pale
cheeks
.
``
This
was
,
indeed
,
a
horrid
event
.
''
said
*NL*
he
in
a
hoarse
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
more
so

it
was

and
not
God

doing

*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
of
those

said
the
abbe
,
``

he
added
in
*NL*
an
almost
menacing
tone
,

everything

*NL*
*NL*
``

added
quickly

they

made

indistinct

said
all

*NL*
``
Yes

I
was
there

I

confess
I
had
my
fears

in

state

politics
then
were

held

preys

often
ask

this

the
only

one
with

I
have
seriously
to
reproach
myself

is
*NL*
no
doubt
the
cause

my
abject
condition

I
am
expiating
a
moment
of
*NL*
selfishness

so
I
always
say
to
La

complains

Hold
your
tongue

it
is
the
will

And
Caderousse
bowed
*NL*
his
head
with
every
sign
of
real
repentance

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
sir

''
said
the
abbe

you
have
spoken
unreservedly

thus
to

accuse
yourself

to
deserve
pardon

Unfortunately

interrupted
Caderousse

There
was
a
brief
silence
;
the
abbe
rose
and
paced
up
*NL*
and
down
pensively
,
and
then
resumed
his
seat
.
``
You
have
two
or
three
*NL*
times
mentioned

*NL*
``
The
part
of
an
honest
man

full
of
courage

real
regard

Twenty

times
he
interceded
for
Edmond

When
the
emperor
returned

he
wrote

*NL*
implored

threatened
,
and
so
energetically
,
that
on
the
second

restoration
he
was
persecuted
as
a
Bonapartist

Ten
times
,
as
I
told
*NL*
you
,
he
came
to
see
Dantes

father

offered
to
receive
him
in
his
*NL*
own
house
;
and
the
night
or
two
before
his
death
,
as
I
have
already

said

he
left
his
purse
on
the
mantelpiece

with
which
they
paid
the
old

debts

buried
him
decently

so
Edmond

father
died

lived

without
doing
harm

made
of

they

with
ten

in

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

said
the

peculiar
tone

*NL*
*NL*
``
Happy

Who
can
answer
for
that

Happiness

the

to
one

the

*NL*

But
how
could
a

fisher-boy
,
without

make
a

I
confess
this
staggers
me

it
has
staggered
everybody

*NL*
*NL*

But
,
then
,
by

attained
this

or
*NL*

*NL*
``
Both

he
has
both
fortune

both

This

be
impossible
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
seem
so
;
but
listen
,
and
you
will
understand
.
Some
days
before
*NL*
the
return
of
the
emperor
,
Fernand
was
drafted
.
The
Bourbons
left
him
*NL*
quietly
enough
at
the
Catalans
,
but
Napoleon
returned
,
a
special
levy
*NL*
was
made
,
and
Fernand
was
compelled
to
join
.
I
went
too
;
but
as
I
was
*NL*
older
than
Fernand
,
and
had
just
married
my
poor
wife
,
I
was
only
sent
*NL*
to
the
coast
.
Fernand
was
enrolled
in
the
active
troop
,
went
to
the
*NL*
frontier
with
his
regiment
,
and
was
at
the
battle
of
Ligny
.
The
night
*NL*
after
that
battle
he
was
sentry
at
the
door
of
a
general
who
carried
on
*NL*
a
secret
correspondence
with
the
enemy
.
That
same
night
the
general
*NL*
was
to
go
over
to
the
English
.
He
proposed
to
Fernand
to
accompany
him
;
*NL*
Fernand
agreed
to
do
so
,
deserted
his
post
,
and
followed
the
general
.
*NL*
Fernand
would
have
been
court-martialed
if
Napoleon
had
remained
on
*NL*
the
throne
,
but
his
action
was
rewarded
by
the
Bourbons
.
He
returned
to
*NL*
France
with
the
epaulet
of
sub-lieutenant
,
and
as
the
protection
of
*NL*
the
general
,
who
is
in
the
highest
favor
,
was
accorded
to
him
,
he
was
*NL*
a
captain
in
1823
,
during
the
Spanish
war
--
that
is
to
say
,
at
the
time
*NL*
when
Danglars
made
his
early
speculations
.
Fernand
was
a
Spaniard
,
and
*NL*
being
sent
to
Spain
to
ascertain
the
feeling
of
his
fellow-countrymen
,
*NL*
found
Danglars
there
,
got
on
very
intimate
terms
with
him
,
won
over
the
*NL*
support
of
the
royalists
at
the
capital
and
in
the
provinces
,
received
*NL*
promises
and
made
pledges
on
his
own
part
,
guided
his
regiment
by
paths
*NL*
known
to
himself
alone
through
the
mountain
gorges
which
were
held
*NL*
by
the
royalists
,
and
,
in
fact
,
rendered
such
services
in
this
brief
*NL*
campaign
that
,
after
the
taking
of
Trocadero
,
he
was
made
colonel
,
and
*NL*
received
the
title
of
count
and
the
cross
of
an
officer
of
the
Legion
of
*NL*
Honor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Destiny
!
destiny
!
''
murmured
the
abbe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
listen
:
this
was
not
all
.
The
war
with
Spain
being
ended
,
*NL*
Fernand
's
career
was
checked
by
the
long
peace
which
seemed
likely
to
*NL*
endure
throughout
Europe
.
Greece
only
had
risen
against
Turkey
,
and
had
*NL*
begun
her
war
of
independence
;
all
eyes
were
turned
towards
Athens
--
it
*NL*
was
the
fashion
to
pity
and
support
the
Greeks
.
The
French
government
,
*NL*
without
protecting
them
openly
,
as
you
know
,
gave
countenance
to
*NL*
volunteer
assistance
.
Fernand
sought
and
obtained
leave
to
go
and
serve
*NL*
in
Greece
,
still
having
his
name
kept
on
the
army
roll
.
Some
time
after
,
*NL*
it
was
stated
that
the
Comte
de
Morcerf
-LRB-
this
was
the
name
he
bore
-RRB-
had
*NL*
entered
the
service
of
Ali
Pasha
with
the
rank
of
instructor-general
.
*NL*
Ali
Pasha
was
killed
,
as
you
know
,
but
before
he
died
he
recompensed
*NL*
the
services
of
Fernand
by
leaving
him
a
considerable
sum
,
with
which
he
*NL*
returned
to
France
,
when
he
was
gazetted
lieutenant-general
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
So

Caderousse

Rue

Paris

''
The
abbe
opened
his
mouth
,
hesitated
for
*NL*
a
moment
,
then
,
making
an
effort
at
self-control
,
he
said
,
``
And
*NL*
Mercedes
--
they
tell
me
that
she
has
disappeared
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Disappeared

''
said
Caderousse
,
``
yes
,
as
the
sun
disappears
,
to
rise
the
*NL*
next
day
with
still
more
splendor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
she
made
a
fortune
also
?
''
inquired
the
abbe
,
with
an
ironical
*NL*
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mercedes
is
at
this
moment
one
of
the
greatest
ladies
in
Paris
,
''
*NL*
replied
Caderousse
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
on
,
''
said
the
abbe
;
``
it
seems
as
if
I
were
listening
to
the
story
of
*NL*
a
dream
.
But
I
have
seen
things
so
extraordinary
,
that
what
you
tell
me
*NL*
seems
less
astonishing
than
it
otherwise
might
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mercedes
was
at
first
in
the
deepest
despair
at
the
blow
which
deprived
*NL*
her
of
Edmond
.
I
have
told
you
of
her
attempts
to
propitiate
M.
de
*NL*
Villefort
,
her
devotion
to
the
elder
Dantes
.
In
the
midst
of
her
*NL*
despair
,
a
new
affliction
overtook
her
.
This
was
the
departure
of
*NL*
Fernand
--
of
Fernand
,
whose
crime
she
did
not
know
,
and
whom
she
regarded
*NL*
as
her
brother
.
Fernand
went
,
and
Mercedes
remained
alone
.
Three
months
*NL*
passed
and
still
she
wept
--
no
news
of
Edmond
,
no
news
of
Fernand
,
no
*NL*
companionship
save
that
of
an
old
man
who
was
dying
with
despair
.
One
*NL*
evening
,
after
a
day
of
accustomed
vigil
at
the
angle
of
two
roads
*NL*
leading
to
Marseilles
from
the
Catalans
,
she
returned
to
her
home
*NL*
more
depressed
than
ever
.
Suddenly
she
heard
a
step
she
knew
,
turned
*NL*
anxiously
around
,
the
door
opened
,
and
Fernand
,
dressed
in
the
uniform
*NL*
of
a
sub-lieutenant
,
stood
before
her
.
It
was
not
the
one
she
wished
for
*NL*
most
,
but
it
seemed
as
if
a
part
of
her
past
life
had
returned
to
her
.
*NL*
Mercedes
seized
Fernand
's
hands
with
a
transport
which
he
took
for
love
,
*NL*
but
which
was
only
joy
at
being
no
longer
alone
in
the
world
,
and
seeing
*NL*
at
last
a
friend
,
after
long
hours
of
solitary
sorrow
.
And
then
,
it
must
*NL*
be
confessed
,
Fernand
had
never
been
hated
--
he
was
only
not
precisely
*NL*
loved
.
Another
possessed
all
Mercedes
'
heart
;
that
other
was
absent
,
had
*NL*
disappeared
,
perhaps
was
dead
.
At
this
last
thought
Mercedes
burst
into
*NL*
a
flood
of
tears
,
and
wrung
her
hands
in
agony
;
but
the
thought
,
which
*NL*
she
had
always
repelled
before
when
it
was
suggested
to
her
by
another
,
*NL*
came
now
in
full
force
upon
her
mind
;
and
then
,
too
,
old
Dantes
*NL*
incessantly
said
to
her
,
`
Our
Edmond
is
dead
;
if
he
were
not
,
he
would
*NL*
return
to
us
.
'
The
old
man
died
,
as
I
have
told
you
;
had
he
lived
,
*NL*
Mercedes
,
perchance
,
had
not
become
the
wife
of
another
,
for
he
would
*NL*
have
been
there
to
reproach
her
infidelity
.
Fernand
saw
this
,
and
when
*NL*
he
learned
of
the
old
man
's
death
he
returned
.
He
was
now
a
lieutenant
.
*NL*
At
his
first
coming
he
had
not
said
a
word
of
love
to
Mercedes
;
at
the
*NL*
second
he
reminded
her
that
he
loved
her
.
Mercedes
begged
for
six
months
*NL*
more
in
which
to
await
and
mourn
for
Edmond
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
that
,
''
said
the
abbe
,
with
a
bitter
smile
,
``
that
makes
eighteen
*NL*
months
in
all
.
What
more
could
the
most
devoted
lover
desire
?
''
Then
he
*NL*
murmured
the
words
of
the
English
poet
,
''
`
Frailty
,

name
is
woman

*NL*
*NL*
``
Six
months
afterwards

continued
Caderousse
,
``
the
marriage
took
place
*NL*
in
the
church
of
Accoules

*NL*
*NL*
``
The
very
church
in
which
she
was
to
have
married

murmured
the
*NL*
priest
;

there
was
only
a
change

bride-grooms

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

Mercedes
was

proceeded
Caderousse
;
``

although
in
the
*NL*
eyes
of
the
world
she
appeared
calm

she
nearly
fainted
as
she
passed
*NL*
La
Reserve
,
where
,
eighteen
months
before

the
betrothal
had
been
*NL*
celebrated
with
him

known

still

Fernand

more
happy

not
more
at

his
ease

for
I
saw
at
this
time
he
was
in
constant
dread
of
Edmond
's
*NL*
return
--
Fernand
was
very
anxious
to
get
his
wife
away
,
and
to
depart
*NL*
himself
.
There
were
too
many
unpleasant
possibilities
associated
with
*NL*
the
Catalans
,
and
eight
days
after
the
wedding
they
left
Marseilles

continued
the

uneducated

already
waxing
great

she
developed

Edmond
had
one

friend
only

and
thus
it
can
not
be
divided

Take
the
diamond
,
then
,
and
*NL*
sell
it
;
it
is
worth
fifty
thousand
francs
,
and
I
repeat
my
wish
that
*NL*
this
sum
may
suffice
to
release
you
from
your
wretchedness

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
sir
,
''
said
Caderousse
,
putting
out
one
hand
timidly
,
and
with
the
*NL*
other
wiping
away
the
perspiration
which
bedewed
his
brow
,
--
``
Oh
,
sir
,
do
*NL*
not
make
a
jest
of
the
happiness

despair
of

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
what
happiness

what
despair
are

never

Take
it
,
then
,
but
in
exchange

''
*NL*
*NL*
Caderousse
,
who
touched
the
diamond
,
withdrew
his
hand
.
The
abbe
smiled
.
*NL*
``
In
exchange
,
''
he
continued
,
``
give
me
the
red
silk
purse
that
M.
Morrel

left
on

chimney-piece

which
you
tell
me
is
still
in
*NL*
your
hands

''
Caderousse
,
more
and
more
astonished
,
went
toward
a
large
*NL*
oaken
cupboard
,
opened
it
,
and
gave
the
abbe
a
long
purse
of
faded
red
*NL*
silk
,
round
which
were
two
copper
runners
that
had
once
been
gilt
.
The
*NL*
abbe
took
it
,
and
in
return
gave
Caderousse
the
diamond
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
are
a
man
of
God
,
sir
,
''
cried
Caderousse
;
``
for
no
one
knew
that
*NL*
Edmond
had
given
you
this
diamond
,
and
you
might
have
kept
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
Which
,
''
said
the
abbe
to
himself
,
``
you
would
have
done

''
The
abbe
*NL*
rose
,
took
his
hat
and
gloves
.
``
Well
,
''
he
said
,
``
all
you
have
told
me
is
*NL*
perfectly
true

I
may
believe
it
in
every

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
See

''
replied
Caderousse
,
``
in
this
corner
is
a

have
told

*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
well

said
the
abbe
,
convinced
by
his
manner
and
tone
that

Caderousse
spoke
the
truth
.

Adieu

I
go
far
from

thus
so
bitterly
injure

*NL*
The
abbe
with
difficulty
got
away
from
the
enthusiastic
thanks
of
*NL*
Caderousse
,
opened
the
door
himself
,
got
out
and
mounted
his
horse
,
once
*NL*
more
saluted
the
innkeeper
,
who
kept
uttering
his
loud
farewells
,
and
*NL*
then
returned
by
the
road
he
had
travelled
in
coming
.
When
Caderousse
*NL*
turned
around
,
he
saw
behind
him
La
Carconte
,
paler
and
trembling
more
*NL*
than
ever
.
``
Is
,
then
,
all
that
I
have
heard
really
true
?
''
she
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
That
he
has
given
the
diamond
to
us
only
?

inquired
Caderousse
,
*NL*
half
bewildered
with
joy
;
``
yes
,
nothing
more
true
!
See
,
here
it
is
.
''
The
*NL*
woman
gazed
at
it
a
moment
,
and
then
said
,
in
a
gloomy
voice
,
``
Suppose
*NL*
it
's
false
?
''
Caderousse
started
and
turned
pale
.
``
False
!
''
he
muttered
.
*NL*
``
False
!
Why
should
that
man
give
me
a
false
diamond
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
To
get
your
secret
without
paying
for
it

you
blockhead
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Caderousse
remained
for
a
moment
aghast
under
the
weight
of
such
an
*NL*
idea
.
``
Oh
!
''
he
said
,
taking
up
his
hat
,
which
he
placed
on
the
red
*NL*
handkerchief
tied
round
his
head
,
``
we
will
soon
find
out

``
In

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

the
fair

and
Caderousse
left
the
house
in
haste
,
*NL*
and
ran
rapidly
in
the
direction
opposite
to
that
which
the
priest
had
*NL*
taken
.
``
Fifty
thousand

muttered
La
Carconte
when
left
alone
;

it
is
not

The
Prison
Register
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
day
after
that
in
which
the
scene
we
have
just
described
had
taken
*NL*
place
on
the
road
between
Bellegarde
and
Beaucaire
,
a
man
of
about
*NL*
thirty
or
two
and
thirty
,
dressed
in
a
bright
blue
frock
coat
,
nankeen
*NL*
trousers
,
and
a
white
waistcoat
,
having
the
appearance
and
accent
of
*NL*
an
Englishman
,
presented
himself
before
the
mayor
of
Marseilles
.
``
Sir
,
''
*NL*
said
he
,
``
I
am
chief
clerk
of
the
house
of
Thomson
&
French
,
of
Rome
.
We
*NL*
are
,
and
have
been
these
ten
years
,
connected
with
the
house
of
Morrel
*NL*
&
Son
,
of
Marseilles
.
We
have
a
hundred
thousand
francs
or
thereabouts
*NL*
loaned
on
their
securities
,
and
we
are
a
little
uneasy
at
reports
that
*NL*
have
reached
us
that
the
firm
is
on
the
brink
of
ruin
.
I
have
come
,
*NL*
therefore
,
express
from
Rome
,
to
ask
you
for
information
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
,
''
replied
the
mayor
.
``
I
know
very
well
that
during
the
last
four
or
*NL*
five
years
misfortune
has
seemed
to
pursue
M.
Morrel
.
He
has
lost
four
*NL*
or
five
vessels
,
and
suffered
by
three
or
four
bankruptcies
;
but
it
*NL*
is
not
for
me
,
although
I
am
a
creditor
myself
to
the
amount
of
*NL*
ten
thousand
francs
,
to
give
any
information
as
to
the
state
of
his
*NL*
finances
.
Ask
of
me
,
as
mayor
,
what
is
my
opinion
of
M.
Morrel
,
and
I
*NL*
shall
say
that
he
is
a
man
honorable
to
the
last
degree
,
and
who
has
*NL*
up
to
this
time
fulfilled
every
engagement
with
scrupulous
punctuality
.
*NL*
This
is
all
I
can
say
,
sir
;
if
you
wish
to
learn
more
,
address
yourself
*NL*
to
M.
de
Boville
,
the
inspector
of
prisons
,
No.
15
,
Rue
de
Nouailles
;
*NL*
he
has
,
I
believe
,
two
hundred
thousand
francs
in
Morrel
's
hands
,
and
if
*NL*
there
be
any
grounds
for
apprehension
,
as
this
is
a
greater
amount
than
*NL*
mine
,
you
will
most
probably
find
him
better
informed
than
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Englishman
seemed
to
appreciate
this
extreme
delicacy
,
made
his
bow
*NL*
and
went
away
,
proceeding
with
a
characteristic
British
stride
towards
*NL*
the
street
mentioned
.
M.
de
Boville
was
in
his
private
room
,
and
the
*NL*
Englishman
,
on
perceiving
him
,
made
a
gesture
of
surprise
,
which
seemed
*NL*
to
indicate
that
it
was
not
the
first
time
he
had
been
in
his
presence
.
*NL*
As
to
M.
de
Boville
,
he
was
in
such
a
state
of
despair
,
that
it
was
*NL*
evident
all
the
faculties
of
his
mind
,
absorbed
in
the
thought
which
*NL*
occupied
him
at
the
moment
,
did
not
allow
either
his
memory
or
his
*NL*
imagination
to
stray
to
the
past
.
The
Englishman
,
with
the
coolness
of
*NL*
his
nation
,
addressed
him
in
terms
nearly
similar
to
those
with
which
*NL*
he
had
accosted
the
mayor
of
Marseilles
.
``
Oh
,
sir
,
''
exclaimed
M.
de
*NL*
Boville
,
``
your
fears
are
unfortunately
but
too
well
founded
,
and
you
see
*NL*
before
you
a
man
in
despair
.
I
had
two
hundred
thousand
francs
placed
*NL*
in
the
hands
of
Morrel
&
Son
;
these
two
hundred
thousand
francs
were
the
*NL*
dowry
of
my
daughter
,
who
was
to
be
married
in
a
fortnight
,
and
these
*NL*
two
hundred
thousand
francs
were
payable
,
half
on
the
15th
of
this
*NL*
month
,
and
the
other
half
on
the
15th
of
next
month
.
I
had
informed
M.
*NL*
Morrel
of
my
desire
to
have
these
payments
punctually
,
and
he
has
been
*NL*
here
within
the
last
half-hour
to
tell
me
that
if
his
ship
,
the
Pharaon
,
*NL*
did
not
come
into
port
on
the
15th
,
he
would
be
wholly
unable
to
make
*NL*
this
payment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
''
said
the
Englishman
,
``
this
looks
very
much
like
a
suspension
of
*NL*
payment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
looks
more
like
bankruptcy
!
''
exclaimed
M.
de
Boville
despairingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Englishman
appeared
to
reflect
a
moment
,
and
then
said
,
--
``
From
which
*NL*
it
would
appear
,
sir
,
that
this
credit
inspires
you
with
considerable
*NL*
apprehension
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
tell
you
the
truth
,
I
consider
it
lost
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
I
will
buy
it
of
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
at
a
tremendous
discount
,
of
course
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
for
two
hundred
thousand
francs
.
Our
house
,
''
added
the
Englishman
*NL*
with
a
laugh
,
``
does
not
do
things
in
that
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
will
pay
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ready
money
.
''
And
the
Englishman
drew
from
his
pocket
a
bundle
of
*NL*
bank-notes
,
which
might
have
been
twice
the
sum
M.
de
Boville
feared
*NL*
to
lose
.
A
ray
of
joy
passed
across
M.
de
Boville
's
countenance
,
yet
*NL*
he
made
an
effort
at
self-control
,
and
said
,
--
``
Sir
,
I
ought
to
tell
*NL*
you
that
,
in
all
probability
,
you
will
not
realize
six
per
cent
of
this
*NL*
sum
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
no
affair
of
mine

replied
the
Englishman
,
``
that
is
the
affair
*NL*
of
the
house
of
Thomson
&
French
,
in
whose
name
I
act

They
have
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
some
motive
to
serve
in
hastening
the
ruin
of
a
rival
firm
.
*NL*
But
all
I
know
,
sir
,
is
,
that
I
am
ready
to
hand
you
over
this
sum
in
*NL*
exchange
for
your
assignment
of
the
debt

I
only
ask
a
brokerage

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
,
that
is
perfectly
just

cried
M.
de
Boville
.
``
The

laughing

It

sir

that

they

No

M.

not
for
the
*NL*
survivor

on
the
contrary
,
this
Dantes
saw
a
means

He
,
no

,
thought
that
prisoners

died
in
the
Chateau

were
interred
in
an
ordinary
burial-ground

he
conveyed

*NL*
``
It
was
a

one
that

remarked
the

*NL*
*NL*
``
As
I
have
already
told
you

he
was
a
very
dangerous

fortunately

by
his
own
act
disembarrassed
the
government

*NL*
*NL*

No

The

*NL*
``

the

the
inspector

You
may
imagine
the

I
should
like

have
seen
his

*NL*
*NL*
``
That

have
been
difficult

*NL*
*NL*

No

replied
De

in
supreme
good-humor
at
the
certainty

of
recovering
his
two
hundred
thousand
francs
,
--
``
no

I
can
fancy
*NL*
it

And
he
shouted
with
laughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
can
I
,
''
said
the
Englishman
,
and
he
laughed
too
;
but
he
laughed
as
*NL*
the
English
do
,
``
at
the
end
of
his
teeth

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
so
,
''
continued
the
Englishman
who
first
gained
his
composure
,
``
he
*NL*
was
drowned
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Unquestionably
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
that
the
governor
got
rid
of
the
dangerous

the

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Precisely
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
some
official
document
was
drawn
up
as

this

I
suppose

*NL*
inquired
the
Englishman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

yes

the

might

some
interest

*NL*
alive

*NL*
*NL*
``
So
that
now
,
if
there
were
anything
to
inherit
from
him
,
they
may
do
so
*NL*
with
easy
conscience
.
He
is
dead

and
no
mistake
about
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

yes

and
they
may
have
the
fact
attested

they

*NL*
*NL*
``
So
be
it
,
''
said
the
Englishman
.
``
But
to
return
to
these
registers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
True
,
this
story
has
diverted
our
attention
from
them

Excuse

*NL*
*NL*
``
Excuse
you
for
what
?
For
the
story

no

it
really
seems
to
me
*NL*
very
curious
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
indeed
.
So
,
sir
,
you
wish
to
see
all
relating
to
the
poor
abbe
,
*NL*
who
really
was
gentleness
itself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
you
will
much
oblige
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
into
my
study
here
,
and
I
will
show
it
to
you
.
''
And
they
both
*NL*
entered
M.
de
Boville
's
study
.
Everything
was
here
arranged
in
perfect
*NL*
order
;
each
register
had
its
number
,
each
file
of
papers
its
place
.
The
*NL*
inspector
begged
the
Englishman
to
seat
himself
in
an
arm-chair
,
and
*NL*
placed
before
him
the
register
and
documents
relative
to
the
Chateau
*NL*
d'If
,
giving
him
all
the
time
he
desired
for
the
examination
,
while
De
*NL*
Boville
seated
himself
in
a
corner
,
and
began
to
read
his
newspaper
.
The
*NL*
Englishman
easily
found
the
entries
relative
to
the
Abbe
Faria
;
but
it
*NL*
seemed
that
the
history
which
the
inspector
had
related
interested
him
*NL*
greatly
,
for
after
having
perused
the
first
documents
he
turned
over
the
*NL*
leaves
until
he
reached
the
deposition
respecting
Edmond
Dantes
.
There
*NL*
he
found
everything
arranged
in
due
order
,
--
the
accusation
,
examination
,
*NL*
Morrel
's
petition
,
M.
de
Villefort
's
marginal
notes
.
He
folded
up
*NL*
the
accusation
quietly
,
and
put
it
as
quietly
in
his
pocket
;
read
the
*NL*
examination
,
and
saw
that
the
name
of
Noirtier
was
not
mentioned
in
it
;
*NL*
perused
,
too
,
the
application
dated
10th
April
,
1815
,
in
which
Morrel
,
*NL*
by
the
deputy
procureur
's
advice
,
exaggerated
with
the
best
intentions
*NL*
-LRB-
for
Napoleon
was
then
on
the
throne
-RRB-
the
services
Dantes
had
rendered
*NL*
to
the
imperial
cause
--
services
which
Villefort
's
certificates
rendered
*NL*
indispensable
.
Then
he
saw
through
the
whole
thing
.
This
petition
*NL*
to
Napoleon
,
kept
back
by
Villefort
,
had
become
,
under
the
second
*NL*
restoration
,
a
terrible
weapon
against
him
in
the
hands
of
the
king
's
*NL*
attorney
.
He
was
no
longer
astonished
when
he
searched
on
to
find
in
the
*NL*
register
this
note
,
placed
in
a
bracket
against
his
name
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
Edmond
Dantes
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
inveterate
Bonapartist
;
took
an
active
part
in
the
return
from
the
*NL*
Island
of
Elba
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
be
kept
in
strict
solitary
confinement
,
and
to
be
closely
watched
and
*NL*
guarded
.
*NL*
*NL*
Beneath
these
lines
was
written
in
another
hand
:
``
See
note
*NL*
above
--
nothing
can
be
done
.
''
He
compared
the
writing
in
the
bracket
with
*NL*
the
writing
of
the
certificate
placed
beneath
Morrel
's
petition
,
and
*NL*
discovered
that
the
note
in
the
bracket
was
the
same
writing
as
the
*NL*
certificate
--
that
is
to
say
,
was
in
Villefort
's
handwriting
.
As
to
the
*NL*
note
which
accompanied
this
,
the
Englishman
understood
that
it
might
*NL*
have
been
added
by
some
inspector
who
had
taken
a
momentary
interest
in
*NL*
Dantes
'
situation
,
but
who
had
,
from
the
remarks
we
have
quoted
,
found
*NL*
it
impossible
to
give
any
effect
to
the
interest
he
had
felt
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
we
have
said
,
the
inspector
,
from
discretion
,
and
that
he
might
not
*NL*
disturb
the
Abbe
Faria
's
pupil
in
his
researches
,
had
seated
himself
*NL*
in
a
corner
,
and
was
reading
Le
Drapeau
Blanc
.
He
did
not
see
the
*NL*
Englishman
fold
up
and
place
in
his
pocket
the
accusation
written
by
*NL*
Danglars
under
the
arbor
of
La
Reserve
,
and
which
had
the
postmark
,
*NL*
``
Marseilles
,
27th
Feb.
,
delivery
6
o'clock
,
P.M.
''
But
it
must
be
said
*NL*
that
if
he
had
seen
it
,
he
attached
so
little
importance
to
this
scrap
*NL*
of
paper
,
and
so
much
importance
to
his
two
hundred
thousand
francs
,
*NL*
that
he
would
not
have
opposed
whatever
the
Englishman
might
do
,
however
*NL*
irregular
it
might
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thanks
,
''
said
the
latter
,
closing
the
register
with
a
slam
,
``
I
have
*NL*
all
I
want
;
now
it
is
for
me
to
perform
my
promise
.
Give
me
a
simple
*NL*
assignment
of
your
debt
;
acknowledge
therein
the
receipt
of
the
cash
,
*NL*
and
I
will
hand
you
over
the
money
.
''
He
rose
,
gave
his
seat
to
M.
de
*NL*
Boville
,
who
took
it
without
ceremony
,
and
quickly
drew
up
the
required
*NL*
assignment
,
while
the
Englishman
counted
out
the
bank-notes
on
the
other
*NL*
side
of
the
desk
.

Chapter
29
.
The
House
of
Morrel
&
Son
.
*NL*
*NL*
Any
one
who
had
quitted
Marseilles
a
few
years
previously
,
well
*NL*
acquainted
with
the
interior
of
Morrel
's
warehouse
,
and
had
returned
at
*NL*
this
date
,
would
have
found
a
great
change
.
Instead
of
that
air
of
life
,
*NL*
of
comfort
,
and
of
happiness
that
permeates
a
flourishing
and
prosperous
*NL*
business
establishment
--
instead
of
merry
faces
at
the
windows
,
busy
*NL*
clerks
hurrying
to
and
fro
in
the
long
corridors
--
instead
of
the
court
*NL*
filled
with
bales
of
goods
,
re-echoing
with
the
cries
and
the
jokes
of
*NL*
porters
,
one
would
have
immediately
perceived
all
aspect
of
sadness
and
*NL*
gloom
.
Out
of
all
the
numerous
clerks
that
used
to
fill
the
deserted
*NL*
corridor
and
the
empty
office
,
but
two
remained
.
One
was
a
young
man
of
*NL*
three
or
four
and
twenty
,
who
was
in
love
with
M.
Morrel
's
daughter
,
and
*NL*
had
remained
with
him
in
spite
of
the
efforts
of
his
friends
to
induce
*NL*
him
to
withdraw
;
the
other
was
an
old
one-eyed
cashier
,
called
``
Cocles
,
''
*NL*
or
``
Cock-eye
,
''
a
nickname
given
him
by
the
young
men
who
used
to
throng
*NL*
this
vast
now
almost
deserted
bee-hive
,
and
which
had
so
completely
*NL*
replaced
his
real
name
that
he
would
not
,
in
all
probability
,
have
*NL*
replied
to
any
one
who
addressed
him
by
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cocles
remained
in
M.
Morrel
's
service
,
and
a
most
singular
change
had
*NL*
taken
place
in
his
position
;
he
had
at
the
same
time
risen
to
the
rank
*NL*
of
cashier
,
and
sunk
to
the
rank
of
a
servant
.
He
was
,
however
,
the
*NL*
same
Cocles
,
good
,
patient
,
devoted
,
but
inflexible
on
the
subject
of
*NL*
arithmetic
,
the
only
point
on
which
he
would
have
stood
firm
against
the
*NL*
world
,
even
against
M.
Morrel
;
and
strong
in
the
multiplication-table
,
*NL*
which
he
had
at
his
fingers
'
ends
,
no
matter
what
scheme
or
what
trap
*NL*
was
laid
to
catch
him
.
In
the
midst
of
the
disasters
that
befell
the
*NL*
house
,
Cocles
was
the
only
one
unmoved
.
But
this
did
not
arise
from
a
*NL*
want
of
affection
;
on
the
contrary
,
from
a
firm
conviction
.
Like
the
*NL*
rats
that
one
by
one
forsake
the
doomed
ship
even
before
the
vessel
*NL*
weighs
anchor
,
so
all
the
numerous
clerks
had
by
degrees
deserted
the
*NL*
office
and
the
warehouse
.
Cocles
had
seen
them
go
without
thinking
of
*NL*
inquiring
the
cause
of
their
departure
.
Everything
was
as
we
have
said
,
*NL*
a
question
of
arithmetic
to
Cocles
,
and
during
twenty
years
he
had
*NL*
always
seen
all
payments
made
with
such
exactitude
,
that
it
seemed
as
*NL*
impossible
to
him
that
the
house
should
stop
payment
,
as
it
would
to
a
*NL*
miller
that
the
river
that
had
so
long
turned
his
mill
should
cease
to
*NL*
flow
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
had
as
yet
occurred
to
shake
Cocles
'
belief
;
the
last
month
's
*NL*
payment
had
been
made
with
the
most
scrupulous
exactitude
;
Cocles
had
*NL*
detected
an
overbalance
of
fourteen
sous
in
his
cash
,
and
the
same
*NL*
evening
he
had
brought
them
to
M.
Morrel
,
who
,
with
a
melancholy
smile
,
*NL*
threw
them
into
an
almost
empty
drawer
,
saying
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thanks
,
Cocles
;
you
are
the
pearl
of
cashiers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Cocles
went
away
perfectly
happy
,
for
this
eulogium
of
M.
Morrel
,
*NL*
himself
the
pearl
of
the
honest
men
of
Marseilles
,
flattered
him
more
*NL*
than
a
present
of
fifty
crowns
.
But
since
the
end
of
the
month
M.
Morrel
*NL*
had
passed
many
an
anxious
hour
.
In
order
to
meet
the
payments
then
due
;
*NL*
he
had
collected
all
his
resources
,
and
,
fearing
lest
the
report
of
his
*NL*
distress
should
get
bruited
abroad
at
Marseilles
when
he
was
known
to
be
*NL*
reduced
to
such
an
extremity
,
he
went
to
the
Beaucaire
fair
to
sell
his
*NL*
wife
's
and
daughter
's
jewels
and
a
portion
of
his
plate
.
By
this
means
*NL*
the
end
of
the
month
was
passed
,
but
his
resources
were
now
exhausted
.
*NL*
Credit
,
owing
to
the
reports
afloat
,
was
no
longer
to
be
had
;
and
to
*NL*
meet
the
one
hundred
thousand
francs
due
on
the
10th
of
the
present
*NL*
month
,
and
the
one
hundred
thousand
francs
due
on
the
15th
of
the
next
*NL*
month
to
M.
de
Boville
,
M.
Morrel
had
,
in
reality
,
no
hope
but
the
*NL*
return
of
the
Pharaon
,
of
whose
departure
he
had
learnt
from
a
vessel
*NL*
which
had
weighed
anchor
at
the
same
time
,
and
which
had
already
arrived
*NL*
in
harbor
.
But
this
vessel
which
,
like
the
Pharaon
,
came
from
Calcutta
,
*NL*
had
been
in
for
a
fortnight
,
while
no
intelligence
had
been
received
of
*NL*
the
Pharaon
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
was
the
state
of
affairs
when
,
the
day
after
his
interview
with
M.
*NL*
de
Boville
,
the
confidential
clerk
of
the
house
of
Thomson
&
French
*NL*
of
Rome
,
presented
himself
at
M.
Morrel
's
.
Emmanuel
received
him
;
this
*NL*
young
man
was
alarmed
by
the
appearance
of
every
new
face
,
for
every
new
*NL*
face
might
be
that
of
a
new
creditor
,
come
in
anxiety
to
question
the
*NL*
head
of
the
house
.
The
young
man
,
wishing
to
spare
his
employer
the
pain
*NL*
of
this
interview
,
questioned
the
new-comer
;
but
the
stranger
declared
*NL*
that
he
had
nothing
to
say
to
M.
Emmanuel
,
and
that
his
business
was
*NL*
with
M.
Morrel
in
person
.
Emmanuel
sighed
,
and
summoned
Cocles
.
Cocles
*NL*
appeared
,
and
the
young
man
bade
him
conduct
the
stranger
to
M.
Morrel
's
*NL*
apartment
.
Cocles
went
first
,
and
the
stranger
followed
him
.
On
the
*NL*
staircase
they
met
a
beautiful
girl
of
sixteen
or
seventeen
,
who
looked
*NL*
with
anxiety
at
the
stranger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
M.
Morrel
is
in
his
room
,
is
he
not
,
Mademoiselle
Julie
?
''
said
the
*NL*
cashier
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
I
think
so
,
at
least
,
''
said
the
young
girl
hesitatingly
.
``
Go
and
*NL*
see
,
Cocles
,
and
if
my
father
is
there
,
announce
this
gentleman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
will
be
useless
to
announce
me
,
mademoiselle
,
''
returned
the
*NL*
Englishman
.
``
M.
Morrel
does
not
know
my
name
;
this
worthy
gentleman
has
*NL*
only
to
announce
the
confidential
clerk
of
the
house
of
Thomson
&
French
*NL*
of
Rome
,
with
whom
your
father
does
business
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
girl
turned
pale
and
continued
to
descend
,
while
the
stranger
*NL*
and
Cocles
continued
to
mount
the
staircase
.
She
entered
the
office
*NL*
where
Emmanuel
was
,
while
Cocles
,
by
the
aid
of
a
key
he
possessed
,
*NL*
opened
a
door
in
the
corner
of
a
landing-place
on
the
second
staircase
,
*NL*
conducted
the
stranger
into
an
ante-chamber
,
opened
a
second
door
,
which
*NL*
he
closed
behind
him
,
and
after
having
left
the
clerk
of
the
house
of
*NL*
Thomson
&
French
alone
,
returned
and
signed
to
him
that
he
could
enter
.
*NL*
The
Englishman
entered
,
and
found
Morrel
seated
at
a
table
,
turning
over
*NL*
the
formidable
columns
of
his
ledger
,
which
contained
the
list
of
his
*NL*
liabilities
.
At
the
sight
of
the
stranger
,
M.
Morrel
closed
the
ledger
,
*NL*
arose
,
and
offered
a
seat
to
the
stranger
;
and
when
he
had
seen
him
*NL*
seated
,
resumed
his
own
chair
.
Fourteen
years
had
changed
the
worthy
*NL*
merchant
,
who
,
in
his
thirty-sixth
year
at
the
opening
of
this
history
,
*NL*
was
now
in
his
fiftieth
;
his
hair
had
turned
white
,
time
and
sorrow
*NL*
had
ploughed
deep
furrows
on
his
brow
,
and
his
look
,
once
so
firm
and
*NL*
penetrating
,
was
now
irresolute
and
wandering
,
as
if
he
feared
being
*NL*
forced
to
fix
his
attention
on
some
particular
thought
or
person
.
The
*NL*
Englishman
looked
at
him
with
an
air
of
curiosity
,
evidently
mingled
*NL*
with
interest
.
``
Monsieur
,
''
said
Morrel
,
whose
uneasiness
was
increased
*NL*
by
this
examination
,
``
you
wish
to
speak
to
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
monsieur
;
you
are
aware
from
whom
I
come
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
house
of
Thomson
&
French
;
at
least
,
so
my
cashier
tells
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
told
you
rightly
.
The
house
of
Thomson
&
French
had
300,000
or
*NL*
400,000
francs
to
pay
this
month
in
France
;
and
,
knowing
your
strict
*NL*
punctuality
,
have
collected
all
the
bills
bearing
your
signature
,
and
*NL*
charged
me
as
they
became
due
to
present
them
,
and
to
employ
the
money
*NL*
otherwise
.
''
Morrel
sighed
deeply
,
and
passed
his
hand
over
his
forehead
,
*NL*
which
was
covered
with
perspiration
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
then
,
sir
,
''
said
Morrel
,
``
you
hold
bills
of
mine
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
and
for
a
considerable
sum
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
amount
?
''
asked
Morrel
with
a
voice
he
strove
to
render
*NL*
firm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
is
,
''
said
the
Englishman
,
taking
a
quantity
of
papers
from
his
*NL*
pocket
,
``
an
assignment
of
200,000
francs
to
our
house
by
M.
de
Boville
,
*NL*
the
inspector
of
prisons
,
to
whom
they
are
due
.
You
acknowledge
,
of
*NL*
course
,
that
you
owe
this
sum
to
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
he
placed
the
money
in
my
hands
at
four
and
a
half
per
cent
nearly
*NL*
five
years
ago
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
are
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
Half
the
15th

this
month
,
half
the
15th
of
next

*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
so
;
and
now
here
are
32,500
francs
payable
shortly
;
they
are
all
*NL*
signed

you
,
and
assigned
to
our
house
by
the
holders
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
recognize
them
,
''
said
Morrel
,
whose
face
was
suffused
,
as
he
thought
*NL*
that
,
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
,
he
would
be
unable
to
honor
his
*NL*
own
signature
.
``
Is
this
all
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
have
for
the
end
of
the
month
these
bills
which
have
been
*NL*
assigned
to
us
by
the
house
of
Pascal
,
and
the
house
of
Wild
&
Turner
of
*NL*
Marseilles
,
amounting
to
nearly
55,000
.
francs
;
in
all
,
287,500
*NL*
francs
.
''
It
is
impossible
to
describe
what
Morrel
suffered
during
*NL*
this
enumeration
.
``
Two
hundred
and
eighty-seven
thousand
five
hundred
*NL*
francs
,
''
repeated
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
,
''
replied
the
Englishman
.
``
I
will
not
,
''
continued
he
,
after
*NL*
a
moment
's
silence
,
``
conceal
from
you
,
that
while
your
probity
and
*NL*
exactitude
up
to
this
moment
are
universally
acknowledged
,
yet
the
*NL*
report
is
current
in
Marseilles
that
you
are
not
able
to
meet
your
*NL*
liabilities
.
''
At
this
almost
brutal
speech
Morrel
turned
deathly
*NL*
pale
.
``
Sir
,
''
said
he
,
``
up
to
this
time
--
and
it
is
now
more
than
*NL*
four-and-twenty
years
since
I
received
the
direction
of
this
house
from
*NL*
my
father
,
who
had
himself
conducted
it
for
five
and
thirty
years
--
never
*NL*
has
anything
bearing
the
signature
of
Morrel

Son
been
dishonored
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
that

replied
the
Englishman
.
``
But
as

honor
should

answer
another

tell
me
fairly
,
shall
you
pay
these
with
the
same
*NL*
punctuality
?
''
Morrel
shuddered
,
and
looked
at
the
man
,
who
spoke
with
*NL*
more
assurance
than
he
had
hitherto
shown
.
``
To
questions
frankly
put
,
''
*NL*
said
he
,
``
a
straightforward
answer
should
be
given

Yes

I
shall
pay

,
as
I
hope
,
my
vessel
arrives
safely
;
for
its
arrival
will
again
*NL*
procure
me
the
credit
which
the
numerous
accidents
,
of
which
I
have
been
*NL*
the
victim
,
have
deprived
me
;
but
if
the
Pharaon
should
be
lost
,
and
*NL*
this
last
resource
be
gone
''
--
the
poor
man
's
eyes
filled
with
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
the
other
,
``
if
this
last
resource
fail
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
returned
Morrel
,
``
it
is
a
cruel
thing
to
be
forced
to
say
,
but
,
*NL*
already
used
to
misfortune
,
I
must
habituate
myself
to
shame
.
I
fear
I
*NL*
shall
be
forced
to
suspend
payment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
no
friends
who
could
assist
you
?
''
Morrel
smiled
mournfully
.
*NL*
``
In
business
,
sir
,
''
said
he
,
``
one
has
no
friends
,
only
correspondents
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
true
,
''
murmured
the
Englishman
;
``
then
you
have
but
one
hope

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
one

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
last
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The

*NL*
*NL*
``
So
that

--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
ruined

completely
ruined

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
I
was
on
my
way
here
,
a
vessel
was
coming
into
port
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
it
,
sir
;
a
young
man
,
who
still
adheres
to
my
fallen
fortunes
,
*NL*
passes
a
part
of
his
time
in
a
belvidere
at
the
top
of
the
house
,
in
*NL*
hopes
of
being
the
first
to
announce
good
news
to
me
;
he
has
informed
me
*NL*
of
the
arrival
of
this
ship
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
it
is
not
yours
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
she
is
a
Bordeaux
vessel
,
La
Gironde
;
she
comes
from
India
also
;
*NL*
but
she
is
not
mine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
she
has
spoken
to
the
Pharaon
,
and
brings
you
some
tidings
of
*NL*
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
I
tell
you
plainly
one
thing
,
sir
?
I
dread
almost
as
much
to
*NL*
receive
any
tidings
of
my
vessel
as
to
remain
in
doubt
.
Uncertainty
*NL*
is
still
hope
.
''
Then
in
a
low
voice
Morrel
added
,
--
``
This
delay
is
not
*NL*
natural
.
The
Pharaon
left
Calcutta
the
5th
February
;
she
ought
to
have
*NL*
been
here
a
month
ago
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
that
?
''
said
the
Englishman
.
``
What
is
the
meaning
of
that
*NL*
noise
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
oh
!
''
cried
Morrel
,
turning
pale
,
``
what
is
it
?
''
A
loud
noise
was
*NL*
heard
on
the
stairs
of
people
moving
hastily
,
and
half-stifled
sobs
.
*NL*
Morrel
rose
and
advanced
to
the
door
;
but
his
strength
failed
him
and
*NL*
he
sank
into
a
chair
.
The
two
men
remained
opposite
one
another
,
Morrel
*NL*
trembling
in
every
limb
,
the
stranger
gazing
at
him
with
an
air
of
*NL*
profound
pity
.
The
noise
had
ceased
;
but
it
seemed
that
Morrel
expected
*NL*
something
--
something
had
occasioned
the
noise
,
and
something
must
*NL*
follow
.
The
stranger
fancied
he
heard
footsteps
on
the
stairs
;
and
that
*NL*
the
footsteps
,
which
were
those
of
several
persons
,
stopped
at
the
door
.
*NL*
A
key
was
inserted
in
the
lock
of
the
first
door
,
and
the
creaking
of
*NL*
hinges
was
audible
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
only
two
persons
who
have
the
key
to
that
door
,
''
murmured
*NL*
Morrel
,
``
Cocles
and
Julie
.
''
At
this
instant
the
second
door
opened
,
*NL*
and
the
young
girl
,
her
eyes
bathed
with
tears
,
appeared
.
Morrel
rose
*NL*
tremblingly
,
supporting
himself
by
the
arm
of
the
chair
.
He
would
have
*NL*
spoken
,
but
his
voice
failed
him
.
``
Oh
,
father
!
''
said
she
,
clasping
her
*NL*
hands
,
``
forgive
your
child
for
being
the
bearer
of
evil
tidings
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Morrel
again
changed
color
.
Julie
threw
herself
into
his
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
father
,
father
!
''
murmured
she
,
``
courage
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Pharaon
has
gone
down
,
then
?
''
said
Morrel
in
a
hoarse
voice
.
The
*NL*
young
girl
did
not
speak
;
but
she
made
an
affirmative
sign
with
her
head
*NL*
as
she
lay
on
her
father
's
breast
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
the
crew
?
''
asked
Morrel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Saved
,
''
said
the
girl
;
``
saved
by
the
crew
of
the
vessel
that
has
just
*NL*
entered
the
harbor
.
''
Morrel
raised
his
two
hands
to
heaven
with
an
*NL*
expression
of
resignation
and
sublime
gratitude
.
``
Thanks
,
my
God
,
''
said
*NL*
he
,
``
at
least
thou
strikest
but
me
alone
.
''
A
tear
moistened
the
eye
of
*NL*
the
phlegmatic
Englishman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
in
,
come
in
,
''
said
Morrel
,
``
for
I
presume
you
are
all
at
the
*NL*
door
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Scarcely
had
he
uttered
those
words
than
Madame
Morrel
entered
weeping
*NL*
bitterly
.
Emmanuel
followed
her
,
and
in
the
antechamber
were
visible
the
*NL*
rough
faces
of
seven
or
eight
half-naked
sailors
.
At
the
sight
of
these
*NL*
men
the
Englishman
started
and
advanced
a
step
;
then
restrained
himself
,
*NL*
and
retired
into
the
farthest
and
most
obscure
corner
of
the
apartment
.
*NL*
Madame
Morrel
sat
down
by
her
husband
and
took
one
of
his
hands
in
hers
,
*NL*
Julie
still
lay
with
her
head
on
his
shoulder
,
Emmanuel
stood
in
the
*NL*
centre
of
the
chamber
and
seemed
to
form
the
link
between
Morrel
's
*NL*
family
and
the
sailors
at
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
did
this
happen
?
''
said
Morrel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Draw
nearer
,
Penelon
,
''
said
the
young
man
,
``
and
tell
us
all
about
it

''
*NL*
*NL*
An
old
seaman
,
bronzed
by
the
tropical
sun
,
advanced
,
twirling
the
*NL*
remains
of
a
tarpaulin
between
his
hands
.
``
Good-day
,
M.
Morrel
,
''
said
*NL*
he
,
as
if
he
had
just
quitted
Marseilles
the
previous
evening
,
and
had
*NL*
just
returned
from
Aix
or
Toulon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-day

Penelon

returned
Morrel
,
who
could
not
refrain
from
smiling
*NL*
through
his
tears
,
``
where
is
the
captain
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The

*NL*
*NL*
Penelon
rolled
his
quid
in
his
cheek
,
placed
his
hand
before
his
*NL*
mouth
,
turned
his
head
,
and
sent
a
long
jet
of
tobacco-juice
into
the
*NL*
antechamber
,
advanced
his
foot
,
balanced
himself
,
and
began
,
--
``
You
see
,
*NL*
M.
Morrel
,
''
said
he
,
``
we
were
somewhere
between
Cape
Blanc
and
Cape
*NL*
Boyador
,
sailing
with
a
fair
breeze
,
south-south-west
after
a
week
's
*NL*
calm
,
when
Captain
Gaumard
comes
up
to
me
--
I
was
at
the
helm
I
should
*NL*
tell
you
--
and
says
,
`
Penelon
,
what
do
you
think
of
those
clouds
coming
*NL*
up
over
there
?
'
I
was
just
then
looking
at
them
myself
.
`
What
do
I
*NL*
think
,
captain
?
Why
I
think
that
they
are
rising
faster
than
they
have
*NL*
any
business
to
do
,
and
that
they
would
not
be
so
black
if
they
did
n't
*NL*
mean
mischief
.
'
--
`
That
's
my
opinion
too
,
'
said
the
captain
,
`
and
I
'll
*NL*
take
precautions
accordingly
.
We
are
carrying
too
much
canvas
.
Avast
,
*NL*
there
,
all
hands
!
Take
in
the
studding-sl
's
and
stow
the
flying
jib
.
'
It
*NL*
was
time
;
the
squall
was
on
us
,
and
the
vessel
began
to
heel
.
`
Ah
,
'
said
*NL*
the
captain
,
`
we
have
still
too
much
canvas
set
;
all
hands
lower
*NL*
the
mains
`
l
!
'
Five
minutes
after
,
it
was
down
;
and
we
sailed
under
*NL*
mizzen-tops
`
ls
and
to
`
gall
`
nt
sails
.
`
Well
,
Penelon
,
'
said
the
captain
,
*NL*
`
what
makes
you
shake
your
head
?
'
`
Why
,
'
I
says
,
'
I
still
think
you
've
*NL*
got
too
much
on
.
'
'
I
think
you
're
right
,
'
answered
he
,
`
we
shall
have
a
*NL*
gale
.
'
'
A
gale
?
More
than
that
,
we
shall
have
a
tempest
,
or
I
do
n't
know
*NL*
what
's
what
.
'
You
could
see
the
wind
coming
like
the
dust
at
Montredon
;
*NL*
luckily
the
captain
understood
his
business
.
`
Take
in
two
reefs
in
the
*NL*
tops
`
ls
,
'
cried
the
captain
;
`
let
go
the
bowlin
's
,
haul
the
brace
,
lower
*NL*
the
to
`
gall
`
nt
sails
,
haul
out
the
reef-tackles
on
the
yards
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
was
not
enough
for
those
latitudes
,
''
said
the
Englishman
;
``
I
*NL*
should
have
taken
four
reefs
in
the
topsails
and
furled
the
spanker
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
firm
,
sonorous
,
and
unexpected
voice
made
every
one
start
.
Penelon
*NL*
put
his
hand
over
his
eyes
,
and
then
stared
at
the
man
who
thus
*NL*
criticized
the
manoeuvres
of
his
captain
.
``
We
did
better
than
that
,
*NL*
sir
,
''
said
the
old
sailor
respectfully
;
``
we
put
the
helm
up
to
run
*NL*
before
the
tempest
;
ten
minutes
after
we
struck
our
tops
`
ls
and
scudded
*NL*
under
bare
poles
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
vessel
was
very
old
to
risk
that
,
''
said
the
Englishman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
,
it
was
that
that
did
the
business
;
after
pitching
heavily
for
*NL*
twelve
hours
we
sprung
a
leak
.
`
Penelon
,
'
said
the
captain
,
'
I
think
we
*NL*
are
sinking
,
give
me
the
helm
,
and
go
down
into
the
hold
.
'
I
gave
him
*NL*
the
helm
,
and
descended
;
there
was
already
three
feet
of
water
.
`
All
*NL*
hands
to
the
pumps
!
'
I
shouted
;
but
it
was
too
late
,
and
it
seemed
the
*NL*
more
we
pumped
the
more
came
in
.
`
Ah
,
'
said
I
,
after
four
hours
'
work
,
*NL*
`
since
we
are
sinking
,
let
us
sink
;
we
can
die
but
once
.
'
`
That
's
*NL*
the
example
you
set
,
Penelon
,
'
cries
the
captain
;
`
very
well
,
wait
a
*NL*
minute
.
'
He
went
into
his
cabin
and
came
back
with
a
brace
of
pistols
.
*NL*
'
I
will
blow
the
brains
out
of
the
first
man
who
leaves
the
pump
,
'
said
*NL*
he
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
done
!
''
said
the
Englishman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
nothing
gives
you
so
much
courage
as
good
reasons
,
''
continued
*NL*
the
sailor
;
``
and
during
that
time
the
wind
had
abated
,
and
the
sea
gone
*NL*
down
,
but
the
water
kept
rising
;
not
much
,
only
two
inches
an
hour
,
*NL*
but
still
it
rose
.
Two
inches
an
hour
does
not
seem
much
,
but
in
twelve
*NL*
hours
that
makes
two
feet
,
and
three
we
had
before
,
that
makes
five
.
*NL*
`
Come
,
'
said
the
captain
,
`
we
have
done
all
in
our
power
,
and
M.
Morrel
*NL*
will
have
nothing
to
reproach
us
with
,
we
have
tried
to
save
the
ship
,
*NL*
let
us
now
save
ourselves
.
To
the
boats
,
my
lads
,
as
quick
as
you
can
.
'
*NL*
Now
,
''
continued
Penelon
,
``
you
see
,
M.
Morrel
,
a
sailor
is
attached
to
*NL*
his
ship
,
but
still
more
to
his
life
,
so
we
did
not
wait
to
be
told
*NL*
twice
;
the
more
so
,
that
the
ship
was
sinking
under
us
,
and
seemed
to
*NL*
say
,
`
Get
along
--
save
yourselves
.
'
We
soon
launched
the
boat
,
and
all
*NL*
eight
of
us
got
into
it
.
The
captain
descended
last
,
or
rather
,
he
*NL*
did
not
descend
,
he
would
not
quit
the
vessel
;
so
I
took
him
round
the
*NL*
waist
,
and
threw
him
into
the
boat
,
and
then
I
jumped
after
him
.
It
*NL*
was
time
,
for
just
as
I
jumped
the
deck
burst
with
a
noise
like
the
*NL*
broadside
of
a
man-of-war
.
Ten
minutes
after
she
pitched
forward
,
then
*NL*
the
other
way
,
spun
round
and
round
,
and
then
good-by
to
the
Pharaon
.
As
*NL*
for
us
,
we
were
three
days
without
anything
to
eat
or
drink
,
so
that
we
*NL*
began
to
think
of
drawing
lots
who
should
feed
the
rest
,
when
we
saw
La
*NL*
Gironde
;
we
made
signals
of
distress
,
she
perceived
us
,
made
for
us
,
and
*NL*
took
us
all
on
board
.
There
now
,
M.
Morrel
,
that
's
the
whole
truth
,
on
*NL*
the
honor
of
a
sailor
;
is
not
it
true
,
you
fellows
there
?
''
A
general
*NL*
murmur
of
approbation
showed
that
the
narrator
had
faithfully
detailed
*NL*
their
misfortunes
and
sufferings
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
well
,
''
said
M.
Morrel
,
``
I
know
there
was
no
one
in
fault
but
*NL*
destiny
.
It
was
the
will
of
God
that
this
should
happen
,
blessed
be
his
*NL*
name
.
What
wages
are
due
to
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
do
n't
let
us
talk
of
that
,
M.
Morrel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
we
will
talk
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
three
months
,
''
said
Penelon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cocles
,
pay
two
hundred
francs
to
each
of
these
good
fellows
,
''
said
*NL*
Morrel
.
``
At
another
time
,
''
added
he
,
``
I
should
have
said
,
Give
them
,
*NL*
besides
,
two
hundred
francs
over
as
a
present
;
but
times
are
changed
,
*NL*
and
the
little
money
that
remains
to
me
is
not
my
own
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Penelon
turned
to
his
companions
,
and
exchanged
a
few
words
with
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
for
that
,
M.
Morrel
,
''
said
he
,
again
turning
his
quid
,
``
as
for
*NL*
that
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
for
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
money
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
we
all
say
that
fifty
francs
will
be
enough
for
us
at
present
,
*NL*
and
that
we
will
wait
for
the
rest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thanks
,
my
friends
,
thanks
!
''
cried
Morrel
gratefully
;
``
take
it
--
take
*NL*
it
;
and
if
you
can
find
another
employer
,
enter
his
service
;
you
are
*NL*
free
to
do
so
.
''
These
last
words
produced
a
prodigious
effect
on
the
*NL*
seaman
.
Penelon
nearly
swallowed
his
quid
;
fortunately
he
recovered
.
*NL*
``
What
,
M.
Morrel
!
''
said
he
in
a
low
voice
,
``
you
send
us
away
;
you
are
*NL*
then
angry
with
us
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
''
said
M.
Morrel
,
``
I
am
not
angry
,
quite
the
contrary
,
and
I
do
*NL*
not
send
you
away
;
but
I
have
no
more
ships
,
and
therefore
I
do
not
want
*NL*
any
sailors
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
more
ships
!
''
returned
Penelon
;
``
well
,
then
,
you
'll
build
some
;
we
'll
*NL*
wait
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
no
money
to
build
ships
with
,
Penelon
,
''
said
the
poor
owner
*NL*
mournfully
,
``
so
I
can
not
accept
your
kind
offer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
more
money

Then
you
must
not
pay
us

we
can
scud
,
like
the
Pharaon

under
bare
poles
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Enough
,
enough
!
''
cried
Morrel
,
almost
overpowered
;
``
leave
me
,
I
pray
*NL*
you
;
we
shall
meet
again
in
a
happier
time

Emmanuel
,
go
with
them
,
and
*NL*
see
that
my
orders
are
executed

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At

,
we
shall
see
each
other
again

M.
Morrel

''
asked
Penelon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
I
hope
so
,
at
least
.
Now
go

''
He
made
a
sign
to
Cocles
,
who
went
*NL*
first
;
the
seamen
followed
him
and
Emmanuel
brought
up
the
rear
.
``
Now
,
''
*NL*
said
the
owner
to
his
wife
and
daughter
,
``
leave
me
;
I
wish
to
speak
with
*NL*
this
gentleman
.
''
And
he
glanced
towards
the
clerk
of
Thomson
&
French
,
*NL*
who
had
remained
motionless
in
the
corner
during
this
scene
,
in
which
he
*NL*
had
taken
no
part
,
except
the
few
words
we
have
mentioned
.
The
two
women
*NL*
looked
at
this
person
whose
presence
they
had
entirely
forgotten
,
and
*NL*
retired
;
but
,
as
she
left
the
apartment
,
Julie
gave
the
stranger
a
*NL*
supplicating
glance
,
to
which
he
replied
by
a
smile
that
an
indifferent
*NL*
spectator
would
have
been
surprised
to
see
on
his
stern
features
.
The
*NL*
two
men
were
left
alone
.
``
Well
,
sir
,
''
said
Morrel
,
sinking
into
a
chair
,
*NL*
``
you
have
heard
all
,
and
I
have
nothing
further
to
tell
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
,
''
returned
the
Englishman
,
``
that
a
fresh
and
unmerited
misfortune
*NL*
his
overwhelmed
you
,
and
this
only
increases
my
desire
to
serve
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
sir
!
''
cried
Morrel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
see

''
continued
the
stranger
,
``
I
am
one
of
your
largest
*NL*
creditors
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
bills

at

are
the
first
that

fall
due

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
wish
for
time
to
pay

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
delay
would
save
my
honor

and
consequently
my
life

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
long
a
delay
do
you
wish
for
?

--
Morrel
reflected
.
``
Two
months
,
''
*NL*
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
give
you
three
,
''
replied
the
stranger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
''
asked
Morrel
,
``
will
the
house
of
Thomson
&
French
consent
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
take
everything
on
myself
.
To-day
is
the
5th
of
June
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
renew
these
bills
up
to
the
5th
of
September
;
and
on
the
5th
of
*NL*
September
at
eleven
o'clock
-LRB-
the
hand
of
the
clock
pointed
to
eleven
-RRB-
,
I
*NL*
shall
come
to
receive
the
money
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
expect
you
,
''
returned
Morrel
;
``
and
I
will
pay
you
--
or
I
shall
*NL*
be
dead
.
''
These
last
words
were
uttered
in
so
low
a
tone
that
the
*NL*
stranger
could
not
hear
them
.
The
bills
were
renewed
,
the
old
ones
*NL*
destroyed
,
and
the
poor
ship-owner
found
himself
with
three
months
*NL*
before
him
to
collect
his
resources
.
The
Englishman
received
his
thanks
*NL*
with
the
phlegm
peculiar
to
his
nation
;
and
Morrel
,
overwhelming
him
*NL*
with
grateful
blessings
,
conducted
him
to
the
staircase
.
The
stranger
*NL*
met
Julie
on
the
stairs
;
she
pretended
to
be
descending
,
but
in
reality
*NL*
she
was
waiting
for
him
.
``
Oh
,
sir
''
--
said
she
,
clasping
her
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mademoiselle
,
''
said
the
stranger
,
``
one
day
you
will
receive
a
letter
*NL*
signed

Sinbad
the
Sailor

'
Do
exactly
what
the
letter
bids
you
,
however
*NL*
strange
it
may
appear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
,
''
returned
Julie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
promise
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
swear
to
you
I
will

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
well

Adieu

mademoiselle

Continue
to
be
the
good
,
sweet
girl
*NL*
you
are
at
present
,
and
I
have
great
hopes
that
heaven
will
reward
you
*NL*
by
giving
you
Emmanuel
for
a
husband
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julie
uttered
a
faint
cry
,
blushed
like
a
rose
,
and
leaned
against
the
*NL*
baluster
.
The
stranger
waved
his
hand
,
and
continued
to
descend
.
In
*NL*
the
court
he
found
Penelon
,
who
,
with
a
rouleau
of
a
hundred
francs
in
*NL*
either
hand
,
seemed
unable
to
make
up
his
mind
to
retain
them
.
``
Come
*NL*
with
me
,
my
friend

''
said
the
Englishman
;
``
I
wish
to
speak
to
you

Chapter
30
.
The
Fifth
of
September
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
extension
provided
for
by
the
agent
of
Thomson
&
French
,
at
the
*NL*
moment
when
Morrel
expected
it
least
,
was
to
the
poor
shipowner
so
*NL*
decided
a
stroke
of
good
fortune
that
he
almost
dared
to
believe
that
*NL*
fate
was
at
length
grown
weary
of
wasting
her
spite
upon
him
.
The
same
*NL*
day
he
told
his
wife
,
Emmanuel
,
and
his
daughter
all
that
had
occurred
;
*NL*
and
a
ray
of
hope
,
if
not
of
tranquillity
,
returned
to
the
family
.
*NL*
Unfortunately
,
however
,
Morrel
had
not
only
engagements
with
the
house
*NL*
of
Thomson
&
French
,
who
had
shown
themselves
so
considerate
towards
*NL*
him
;
and
,
as
he
had
said
,
in
business
he
had
correspondents
,
and
not
*NL*
friends
.
When
he
thought
the
matter
over
,
he
could
by
no
means
account
*NL*
for
this
generous
conduct
on
the
part
of
Thomson
&
French
towards
him
;
*NL*
and
could
only
attribute
it
to
some
such
selfish
argument
as
this
:
--
``
We
*NL*
had
better
help
a
man
who
owes
us
nearly
300,000
francs
,
and
have
those
*NL*
300,000
francs
at
the
end
of
three
months
than
hasten
his
ruin
,
and
*NL*
get
only
six
or
eight
per
cent
of
our
money
back
again
.
''
Unfortunately
,
*NL*
whether
through
envy
or
stupidity
,
all
Morrel
's
correspondents
did
not
*NL*
take
this
view
;
and
some
even
came
to
a
contrary
decision
.
The
*NL*
bills
signed
by
Morrel
were
presented
at
his
office
with
scrupulous
*NL*
exactitude
,
and
,
thanks
to
the
delay
granted
by
the
Englishman
,
were
*NL*
paid
by
Cocles
with
equal
punctuality
.
Cocles
thus
remained
in
his
*NL*
accustomed
tranquillity
.
It
was
Morrel
alone
who
remembered
with
alarm
,
*NL*
that
if
he
had
to
repay
on
the
15th
the
50,000
francs
of
M.
de
Boville
,
*NL*
and
on
the
30th
the
32,500
francs
of
bills
,
for
which
,
as
well
as
the
*NL*
debt
due
to
the
inspector
of
prisons
,
he
had
time
granted
,
he
must
be
a
*NL*
ruined
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
opinion
of
all
the
commercial
men
was
that
,
under
the
reverses
*NL*
which
had
successively
weighed
down
Morrel
,
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
*NL*
remain
solvent
.
Great
,
therefore
,
was
the
astonishment
when
at
the
*NL*
end
of
the
month
,
he
cancelled
all
his
obligations
with
his
usual
*NL*
punctuality
.
Still
confidence
was
not
restored
to
all
minds
,
and
the
*NL*
general
opinion
was
that
the
complete
ruin
of
the
unfortunate
shipowner
*NL*
had
been
postponed
only
until
the
end
of
the
month
.
The
month
passed
,
*NL*
and
Morrel
made
extraordinary
efforts
to
get
in
all
his
resources
.
*NL*
Formerly
his
paper
,
at
any
date
,
was
taken
with
confidence
,
and
was
even
*NL*
in
request
.
Morrel
now
tried
to
negotiate
bills
at
ninety
days
only
,
and
*NL*
none
of
the
banks
would
give
him
credit
.
Fortunately
,
Morrel
had
some
*NL*
funds
coming
in
on
which
he
could
rely
;
and
,
as
they
reached
him
,
he
*NL*
found
himself
in
a
condition
to
meet
his
engagements
when
the
end
of
*NL*
July
came
.
The
agent
of
Thomson
&
French
had
not
been
again
seen
at
*NL*
Marseilles
;
the
day
after
,
or
two
days
after
his
visit
to
Morrel
,
he
had
*NL*
disappeared
;
and
as
in
that
city
he
had
had
no
intercourse
but
with
the
*NL*
mayor
,
the
inspector
of
prisons
,
and
M.
Morrel
,
his
departure
left
no
*NL*
trace
except
in
the
memories
of
these
three
persons
.
As
to
the
sailors
*NL*
of
the
Pharaon
,
they
must
have
found
snug
berths
elsewhere
,
for
they
*NL*
also
had
disappeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
Captain
Gaumard
,
recovered
from
his
illness
,
had
returned
from
Palma
.
*NL*
He
delayed
presenting
himself
at
Morrel
's
,
but
the
owner
,
hearing
of
*NL*
his
arrival
,
went
to
see
him
.
The
worthy
shipowner
knew
,
from
Penelon
's
*NL*
recital
,
of
the
captain
's
brave
conduct
during
the
storm
,
and
tried
to
*NL*
console
him
.
He
brought
him
also
the
amount
of
his
wages
,
which
Captain
*NL*
Gaumard
had
not
dared
to
apply
for
.
As
he
descended
the
staircase
,
*NL*
Morrel
met
Penelon
,
who
was
going
up
.
Penelon
had
,
it
would
seem
,
made
*NL*
good
use
of
his
money
,
for
he
was
newly
clad
.
When
he
saw
his
employer
,
*NL*
the
worthy
tar
seemed
much
embarrassed
,
drew
on
one
side
into
the
corner
*NL*
of
the
landing-place
,
passed
his
quid
from
one
cheek
to
the
other
,
*NL*
stared
stupidly
with
his
great
eyes
,
and
only
acknowledged
the
squeeze
*NL*
of
the
hand
which
Morrel
as
usual
gave
him
by
a
slight
pressure
in
*NL*
return
.
Morrel
attributed
Penelon
's
embarrassment
to
the
elegance
of
his
*NL*
attire
;
it
was
evident
the
good
fellow
had
not
gone
to
such
an
expense
*NL*
on
his
own
account
;
he
was
,
no
doubt
,
engaged
on
board
some
other
*NL*
vessel
,
and
thus
his
bashfulness
arose
from
the
fact
of
his
not
having
,
*NL*
if
we
may
so
express
ourselves
,
worn
mourning
for
the
Pharaon
longer
.
*NL*
Perhaps
he
had
come
to
tell
Captain
Gaumard
of
his
good
luck
,
and
to
*NL*
offer
him
employment
from
his
new
master
.
``
Worthy
fellows
!
''
said
Morrel
,
*NL*
as
he
went
away
,
``
may
your
new
master
love
you
as
I
loved
you
,
and
be
*NL*
more
fortunate
than
I
have
been
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
August
rolled
by
in
unceasing
efforts
on
the
part
of
Morrel
to
renew
*NL*
his
credit
or
revive
the
old
.
On
the
20th
of
August
it
was
known
at
*NL*
Marseilles
that
he
had
left
town
in
the
mailcoach
,
and
then
it
was
said
*NL*
that
the
bills
would
go
to
protest
at
the
end
of
the
month
,
and
that
*NL*
Morrel
had
gone
away
and
left
his
chief
clerk
Emmanuel
,
and
his
cashier
*NL*
Cocles
,
to
meet
the
creditors
.
But
,
contrary
to
all
expectation
,
when
*NL*
the
31st
of
August
came
,
the
house
opened
as
usual
,
and
Cocles
appeared
*NL*
behind
the
grating
of
the
counter
,
examined
all
bills
presented
with
*NL*
the
usual
scrutiny
,
and
,
from
first
to
last
,
paid
all
with
the
usual
*NL*
precision
.
There
came
in
,
moreover
,
two
drafts
which
M.
Morrel
had
fully
*NL*
anticipated
,
and
which
Cocles
paid
as
punctually
as
the
bills
which
the
*NL*
shipowner
had
accepted
.
All
this
was
incomprehensible
,
and
then
,
with
*NL*
the
tenacity
peculiar
to
prophets
of
bad
news
,
the
failure
was
put
off
*NL*
until
the
end
of
September
.
On
the
1st
,
Morrel
returned
;
he
was
awaited
*NL*
by
his
family
with
extreme
anxiety
,
for
from
this
journey
to
Paris
*NL*
they
hoped
great
things
.
Morrel
had
thought
of
Danglars
,
who
was
now
*NL*
immensely
rich
,
and
had
lain
under
great
obligations
to
Morrel
in
former
*NL*
days
,
since
to
him
it
was
owing
that
Danglars
entered
the
service
of
*NL*
the
Spanish
banker
,
with
whom
he
had
laid
the
foundations
of
his
vast
*NL*
wealth
.
It
was
said
at
this
moment
that
Danglars
was
worth
from
six
*NL*
to
eight
millions
of
francs
,
and
had
unlimited
credit
.
Danglars
,
then
,
*NL*
without
taking
a
crown
from
his
pocket
,
could
save
Morrel
;
he
had
but
to
*NL*
pass
his
word
for
a
loan
,
and
Morrel
was
saved
.
Morrel
had
long
thought
*NL*
of
Danglars
,
but
had
kept
away
from
some
instinctive
motive
,
and
had
*NL*
delayed
as
long
as
possible
availing
himself
of
this
last
resource
.
And
*NL*
Morrel
was
right
,
for
he
returned
home
crushed
by
the
humiliation
of
a
*NL*
refusal
.
Yet
,
on
his
arrival
,
Morrel
did
not
utter
a
complaint
,
or
*NL*
say
one
harsh
word
.
He
embraced
his
weeping
wife
and
daughter
,
pressed
*NL*
Emmanuel
's
hand
with
friendly
warmth
,
and
then
going
to
his
private
room
*NL*
on
the
second
floor
had
sent
for
Cocles
.
``
Then
,
''
said
the
two
women
to
*NL*
Emmanuel
,
``
we
are
indeed
ruined
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
agreed
in
a
brief
council
held
among
them
,
that
Julie
should
*NL*
write
to
her
brother
,
who
was
in
garrison
at
Nimes
,
to
come
to
them
*NL*
as
speedily
as
possible
.
The
poor
women
felt
instinctively
that
they
*NL*
required
all
their
strength
to
support
the
blow
that
impended
.
Besides
,
*NL*
Maximilian
Morrel
,
though
hardly
two
and
twenty
,
had
great
influence
*NL*
over
his
father
.
He
was
a
strong-minded
,
upright
young
man
.
At
the
time
*NL*
when
he
decided
on
his
profession
his
father
had
no
desire
to
choose
for
*NL*
him
,
but
had
consulted
young
Maximilian
's
taste
.
He
had
at
once
declared
*NL*
for
a
military
life
,
and
had
in
consequence
studied
hard
,
passed
*NL*
brilliantly
through
the
Polytechnic
School
,
and
left
it
as
*NL*
sub-lieutenant
of
the
53d
of
the
line
.
For
a
year
he
had
held
this
rank
,
*NL*
and
expected
promotion
on
the
first
vacancy
.
In
his
regiment
Maximilian
*NL*
Morrel
was
noted
for
his
rigid
observance
,
not
only
of
the
obligations
*NL*
imposed
on
a
soldier
,
but
also
of
the
duties
of
a
man
;
and
he
thus
*NL*
gained
the
name
of
``
the
stoic
.
''
We
need
hardly
say
that
many
of
those
*NL*
who
gave
him
this
epithet
repeated
it
because
they
had
heard
it
,
and
did
*NL*
not
even
know
what
it
meant
.
This
was
the
young
man
whom
his
mother
and
*NL*
sister
called
to
their
aid
to
sustain
them
under
the
serious
trial
which
*NL*
they
felt
they
would
soon
have
to
endure
.
They
had
not
mistaken
the
*NL*
gravity
of
this
event
,
for
the
moment
after
Morrel
had
entered
his
*NL*
private
office
with
Cocles
,
Julie
saw
the
latter
leave
it
pale
,
*NL*
trembling
,
and
his
features
betraying
the
utmost
consternation
.
She
*NL*
would
have
questioned
him
as
he
passed
by
her
,
but
the
worthy
creature
*NL*
hastened
down
the
staircase
with
unusual
precipitation
,
and
only
raised
*NL*
his
hands
to
heaven
and
exclaimed
,
``
Oh
,
mademoiselle
,
mademoiselle
,
*NL*
what
a
dreadful
misfortune
!
Who
could
ever
have
believed
it
!
''
A
moment
*NL*
afterwards
Julie
saw
him
go
up-stairs
carrying
two
or
three
heavy
*NL*
ledgers
,
a
portfolio
,
and
a
bag
of
money
.
*NL*
*NL*
Morrel
examined
the
ledgers
,
opened
the
portfolio
,
and
counted
the
*NL*
money
.
All
his
funds
amounted
to
6,000
,
or
8,000
.
francs
,
his
bills
*NL*
receivable
up
to
the
5th
to
4,000
or
5,000
,
which
,
making
the
best
of
*NL*
everything
,
gave
him
14,000
.
francs
to
meet
debts
amounting
to
287,500
*NL*
francs
.
He
had
not
even
the
means
for
making
a
possible
settlement
on
*NL*
account
.
However
,
when
Morrel
went
down
to
his
dinner
,
he
appeared
very
*NL*
calm
.
This
calmness
was
more
alarming
to
the
two
women
than
the
deepest
*NL*
dejection
would
have
been
.
After
dinner
Morrel
usually
went
out
and
used
*NL*
to
take
his
coffee
at
the
Phocaean
club
,
and
read
the
Semaphore
;
this
*NL*
day
he
did
not
leave
the
house
,
but
returned
to
his
office
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
to
Cocles
,
he
seemed
completely
bewildered
.
For
part
of
the
day
he
*NL*
went
into
the
court-yard
,
seated
himself
on
a
stone
with
his
head
bare
*NL*
and
exposed
to
the
blazing
sun
.
Emmanuel
tried
to
comfort
the
women
,
but
*NL*
his
eloquence
faltered
.
The
young
man
was
too
well
acquainted
with
the
*NL*
business
of
the
house
,
not
to
feel
that
a
great
catastrophe
hung
over
*NL*
the
Morrel
family
.
Night
came
,
the
two
women
had
watched
,
hoping
that
*NL*
when
he
left
his
room
Morrel
would
come
to
them
,
but
they
heard
him
pass
*NL*
before
their
door
,
and
trying
to
conceal
the
noise
of
his
footsteps
.
*NL*
They
listened
;
he
went
into
his
sleeping-room
,
and
fastened
the
door
*NL*
inside
.
Madame
Morrel
sent
her
daughter
to
bed
,
and
half
an
hour
after
*NL*
Julie
had
retired
,
she
rose
,
took
off
her
shoes
,
and
went
stealthily
*NL*
along
the
passage
,
to
see
through
the
keyhole
what
her
husband
was
*NL*
doing
.
In
the
passage
she
saw
a
retreating
shadow
;
it
was
Julie
,
who
,
*NL*
uneasy
herself
,
had
anticipated
her
mother
.
The
young
lady
went
towards
*NL*
Madame
Morrel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
writing
,
''
she
said
.
They
had
understood
each
other
without
*NL*
speaking
.
Madame
Morrel
looked
again
through
the
keyhole
,
Morrel
was
*NL*
writing
;
but
Madame
Morrel
remarked
,
what
her
daughter
had
not
observed
,
*NL*
that
her
husband
was
writing
on
stamped
paper
.
The
terrible
idea
that
he
*NL*
was
writing
his
will
flashed
across
her
;
she
shuddered
,
and
yet
had
not
*NL*
strength
to
utter
a
word
.
Next
day
M.
Morrel
seemed
as
calm
as
ever
,
*NL*
went
into
his
office
as
usual
,
came
to
his
breakfast
punctually
,
and
*NL*
then
,
after
dinner
,
he
placed
his
daughter
beside
him
,
took
her
head
*NL*
in
his
arms
,
and
held
her
for
a
long
time
against
his
bosom
.
In
the
*NL*
evening
,
Julie
told
her
mother
,
that
although
he
was
apparently
so
calm
,
*NL*
she
had
noticed
that
her
father
's
heart
beat
violently
.
The
next
*NL*
two
days
passed
in
much
the
same
way
.
On
the
evening
of
the
4th
of
*NL*
September
,
M.
Morrel
asked
his
daughter
for
the
key
of
his
study
.
Julie
*NL*
trembled
at
this
request
,
which
seemed
to
her
of
bad
omen
.
Why
did
her
*NL*
father
ask
for
this
key
which
she
always
kept
,
and
which
was
only
taken
*NL*
from
her
in
childhood
as
a
punishment
?
The
young
girl
looked
at
Morrel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
have
I
done
wrong
,
father
,
''
she
said
,
``
that
you
should
take
this
*NL*
key
from
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
,
my
dear
,
''
replied
the
unhappy
man
,
the
tears
starting
to
his
*NL*
eyes
at
this
simple
question
,
--
``
nothing
,
only
I
want
it
.
''
Julie
made
*NL*
a
pretence
to
feel
for
the
key
.
``
I
must
have
left
it
in
my
room
,
''
*NL*
she
said
.
And
she
went
out
,
but
instead
of
going
to
her
apartment
she
*NL*
hastened
to
consult
Emmanuel
.
``
Do
not
give
this
key
to
your
father
,
''
*NL*
said
he
,
``
and
to-morrow
morning
,
if
possible
,
do
not
quit
him
for
a
*NL*
moment
.
''
She
questioned
Emmanuel
,
but
he
knew
nothing
,
or
would
not
say
*NL*
what
he
knew
.
During
the
night
,
between
the
4th
and
5th
of
September
,
*NL*
Madame
Morrel
remained
listening
for
every
sound
,
and
,
until
three
*NL*
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
she
heard
her
husband
pacing
the
room
in
great
*NL*
agitation
.
It
was
three
o'clock
when
he
threw
himself
on
the
bed
.
*NL*
The
mother
and
daughter
passed
the
night
together
.
They
had
expected
*NL*
Maximilian
since
the
previous
evening
.
At
eight
o'clock
in
the
morning
*NL*
Morrel
entered
their
chamber
.
He
was
calm
;
but
the
agitation
of
the
*NL*
night
was
legible
in
his
pale
and
careworn
visage
.
They
did
not
dare
*NL*
to
ask
him
how
he
had
slept
.
Morrel
was
kinder
to
his
wife
,
more
*NL*
affectionate
to
his
daughter
,
than
he
had
ever
been
.
He
could
not
cease
*NL*
gazing
at
and
kissing
the
sweet
girl
.
Julie
,
mindful
of
Emmanuel
's
*NL*
request
,
was
following
her
father
when
he
quitted
the
room
,
but
he
said
*NL*
to
her
quickly
,
--
``
Remain
with
your
mother
,
dearest
.
''
Julie
wished
to
*NL*
accompany
him
.
``
I
wish
you
to
do
so
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
first
time
Morrel
had
ever
so
spoken
,
but
he
said
it
in
*NL*
a
tone
of
paternal
kindness
,
and
Julie
did
not
dare
to
disobey
.
She
*NL*
remained
at
the
same
spot
standing
mute
and
motionless
.
An
instant
*NL*
afterwards
the
door
opened
,
she
felt
two
arms
encircle
her
,
and
a
mouth
*NL*
pressed
her
forehead
.
She
looked
up
and
uttered
an
exclamation
of
joy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Maximilian
,
my
dearest
brother
!
''
she
cried
.
At
these
words
Madame
*NL*
Morrel
rose
,
and
threw
herself
into
her
son
's
arms
.
``
Mother
,
''
said
the
*NL*
young
man
,
looking
alternately
at
Madame
Morrel
and
her
daughter
,
``
what
*NL*
has
occurred
--
what
has
happened
?
Your
letter
has
frightened
me
,
and
I
*NL*
have
come
hither
with
all
speed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Julie
,
''
said
Madame
Morrel
,
making
a
sign
to
the
young
man
,
``
go
and
*NL*
tell
your
father
that
Maximilian
has
just
arrived
.
''
The
young
lady
*NL*
rushed
out
of
the
apartment
,
but
on
the
first
step
of
the
staircase
she
*NL*
found
a
man
holding
a
letter
in
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
not
Mademoiselle
Julie
Morrel
?
''
inquired
the
man
,
with
a
strong
*NL*
Italian
accent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
,
''
replied
Julie
with
hesitation
;
``
what
is
your
pleasure
?
I
do
*NL*
not
know
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Read
this
letter
,
''
he
said
,
handing
it
to
her
.
Julie
hesitated
.
``
It
*NL*
concerns
the
best
interests
of
your
father
,
''
said
the
messenger
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
girl
hastily
took
the
letter
from
him
.
She
opened
it
quickly
*NL*
and
read
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
this
moment
to
the
Allees
de
Meillan
,
enter
the
house
No.
15
,
*NL*
ask
the
porter
for
the
key
of
the
room
on
the
fifth
floor
,
enter
the
*NL*
apartment
,
take
from
the
corner
of
the
mantelpiece
a
purse
netted
in
red
*NL*
silk
,
and
give
it
to
your
father
.
It
is
important
that
he
should
receive
*NL*
it
before
eleven
o'clock
.
You
promised
to
obey
me
implicitly
.
Remember
*NL*
your
oath
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sinbad
the
Sailor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
girl
uttered
a
joyful
cry
,
raised
her
eyes
,
looked
round
to
*NL*
question
the
messenger
,
but
he
had
disappeared
.
She
cast
her
eyes
*NL*
again
over
the
note
to
peruse
it
a
second
time
,
and
saw
there
was
a
*NL*
postscript
.
She
read
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
important
that
you
should
fulfil
this
mission
in
person
and
*NL*
alone
.
If
you
go
accompanied
by
any
other
person
,
or
should
any
one
else
*NL*
go
in
your
place
,
the
porter
will
reply
that
he
does
not
know
anything
*NL*
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
postscript
decreased
greatly
the
young
girl
's
happiness
.
Was
there
*NL*
nothing
to
fear
?
was
there
not
some
snare
laid
for
her
?
Her
innocence
*NL*
had
kept
her
in
ignorance
of
the
dangers
that
might
assail
a
young
girl
*NL*
of
her
age
.
But
there
is
no
need
to
know
danger
in
order
to
fear
it
;
*NL*
indeed
,
it
may
be
observed
,
that
it
is
usually
unknown
perils
that
*NL*
inspire
the
greatest
terror
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julie
hesitated
,
and
resolved
to
take
counsel
.
Yet
,
through
a
singular
*NL*
impulse
,
it
was
neither
to
her
mother
nor
her
brother
that
she
applied
,
*NL*
but
to
Emmanuel
.
She
hastened
down
and
told
him
what
had
occurred
on
the
*NL*
day
when
the
agent
of
Thomson
&
French
had
come
to
her
father
's
,
related
*NL*
the
scene
on
the
staircase
,
repeated
the
promise
she
had
made
,
and
*NL*
showed
him
the
letter
.
``
You
must
go
,
then
,
mademoiselle
,
''
said
Emmanuel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
there
?
''
murmured
Julie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
I
will
accompany
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
did
you
not
read
that
I
must
be
alone
?
''
said
Julie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
shall
be
alone
,
''
replied
the
young
man
.
``
I
will
await
you
at
*NL*
the
corner
of
the
Rue
de
Musee
,
and
if
you
are
so
long
absent
as
to
make
*NL*
me
uneasy
,
I
will
hasten
to
rejoin
you
,
and
woe
to
him
of
whom
you
shall
*NL*
have
cause
to
complain
to
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
Emmanuel
?
''
said
the
young
girl
with
hesitation
,
``
it
is
your
*NL*
opinion
that
I
should
obey
this
invitation
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
Did
not
the
messenger
say
your
father
's
safety
depended
upon
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
danger
threatens
him
,
then
,
Emmanuel
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
Emmanuel
hesitated
a
moment
,
but
his
desire
to
make
Julie
decide
*NL*
immediately
made
him
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
,
''
he
said
;
``
to-day
is
the
5th
of
September
,
is
it
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To-day
,
then
,
at
eleven
o'clock
,
your
father
has
nearly
three
hundred
*NL*
thousand
francs
to
pay
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
we
know
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
''
continued
Emmanuel
,
``
we
have
not
fifteen
thousand
francs
*NL*
in
the
house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
will
happen
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
if
to-day
before
eleven
o'clock
your
father
has
not
found
someone
*NL*
who
will
come
to
his
aid
,
he
will
be
compelled
at
twelve
o'clock
to
*NL*
declare
himself
a
bankrupt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
come
,
then
,
come
!
''
cried
she
,
hastening
away
with
the
young
man
.
*NL*
During
this
time
,
Madame
Morrel
had
told
her
son
everything
.
The
young
*NL*
man
knew
quite
well
that
,
after
the
succession
of
misfortunes
which
*NL*
had
befallen
his
father
,
great
changes
had
taken
place
in
the
style
of
*NL*
living
and
housekeeping
;
but
he
did
not
know
that
matters
had
reached
*NL*
such
a
point
.
He
was
thunderstruck
.
Then
,
rushing
hastily
out
of
the
*NL*
apartment
,
he
ran
up-stairs
,
expecting
to
find
his
father
in
his
study
,
*NL*
but
he
rapped
there
in
vain
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
he
was
yet
at
the
door
of
the
study
he
heard
the
bedroom
door
*NL*
open
,
turned
,
and
saw
his
father
.
Instead
of
going
direct
to
his
study
,
*NL*
M.
Morrel
had
returned
to
his
bed-chamber
,
which
he
was
only
this
moment
*NL*
quitting
.
Morrel
uttered
a
cry
of
surprise
at
the
sight
of
his
son
,
*NL*
of
whose
arrival
he
was
ignorant
.
He
remained
motionless
on
the
spot
,
*NL*
pressing
with
his
left
hand
something
he
had
concealed
under
his
coat
.
*NL*
Maximilian
sprang
down
the
staircase
,
and
threw
his
arms
round
his
*NL*
father
's
neck
;
but
suddenly
he
recoiled
,
and
placed
his
right
hand
on
*NL*
Morrel
's
breast
.
``
Father
,
''
he
exclaimed
,
turning
pale
as
death
,
``
what
*NL*
are
you
going
to
do
with
that
brace
of
pistols
under
your
coat
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
this
is
what
I
feared
!
''
said
Morrel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Father
,
father
,
in
heaven
's
name
,
''
exclaimed
the
young
man
,
``
what
are
*NL*
these
weapons
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Maximilian
,
''
replied
Morrel
,
looking
fixedly
at
his
son
,
``
you
are
a
*NL*
man
,
and
a
man
of
honor
.
Come
,
and
I
will
explain
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
with
a
firm
step
Morrel
went
up
to
his
study
,
while
Maximilian
*NL*
followed
him
,
trembling
as
he
went
.
Morrel
opened
the
door
,
and
closed
*NL*
it
behind
his
son
;
then
,
crossing
the
anteroom
,
went
to
his
desk
on
*NL*
which
he
placed
the
pistols
,
and
pointed
with
his
finger
to
an
open
*NL*
ledger
.
In
this
ledger
was
made
out
an
exact
balance-sheet
of
his
*NL*
affair
's
.
Morrel
had
to
pay
,
within
half
an
hour
,
287,500
francs
.
All
he
*NL*
possessed
was
15,257
francs
.
``
Read
!
''
said
Morrel
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
was
overwhelmed
as
he
read
.
Morrel
said
not
a
word
.
What
*NL*
could
he
say
?
What
need
he
add
to
such
a
desperate
proof
in
figures
?
''
*NL*
And
have
you
done
all
that
is
possible
,
father
,
to
meet
this
disastrous
*NL*
result
?
''
asked
the
young
man
,
after
a
moment
's
pause
.
``
I
have
,
''
replied
*NL*
Morrel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
no
money
coming
in
on
which
you
can
rely
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
None
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
exhausted
every
resource
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
in
half
an
hour
,
''
said
Maximilian
in
a
gloomy
voice
,
``
our
name
is
*NL*
dishonored
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Blood
washes
out
dishonor
,
''
said
Morrel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
right
,
father
;
I
understand
you
.
''
Then
extending
his
hand
*NL*
towards
one
of
the
pistols
,
he
said
,
``
There
is
one
for
you
and
one
for
*NL*
me
--
thanks
!
''
Morrel
caught
his
hand
.
``
Your
mother
--
your
sister
!
Who
will
*NL*
support
them
?
''
A
shudder
ran
through
the
young
man
's
frame
.
``
Father
,
''
he
*NL*
said
,
``
do
you
reflect
that
you
are
bidding
me
to
live
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
do
so
bid
you
,
''
answered
Morrel
,
``
it
is
your
duty
.
You
have
a
*NL*
calm
,
strong
mind

Maximilian
.
Maximilian
,
you
are
no
ordinary
man
.
I
*NL*
make
no
requests
or
commands
;
I
only
ask
you
to
examine
my
position
as
*NL*
if
it
were
your
own
,
and
then
judge
for
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
reflected
for
a
moment
,
then
an
expression
of
sublime
*NL*
resignation
appeared
in
his
eyes
,
and
with
a
slow
and
sad
gesture
he
*NL*
took
off
his
two
epaulets
,
the
insignia
of
his
rank
.
``
Be
it
so
,
then
,
*NL*
my
father
,
''
he
said
,
extending
his
hand
to
Morrel
,
``
die
in
peace
,
my
*NL*
father
;
I
will
live
.
''
Morrel
was
about
to
cast
himself
on
his
knees
*NL*
before
his
son
,
but
Maximilian
caught
him
in
his
arms
,
and
those
two
*NL*
noble
hearts
were
pressed
against
each
other
for
a
moment
.
``
You
know
it
*NL*
is
not
my
fault
,
''
said
Morrel
.
Maximilian
smiled
.
``
I
know
,
father
,
you
*NL*
are
the
most
honorable
man
I
have
ever
known
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
,
my
son
.
And
now
there
is
no
more
to
be
said
;
go
and
rejoin
your
*NL*
mother
and
sister
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
father
,
''
said
the
young
man
,
bending
his
knee
,
``
bless
me
!
''
Morrel
*NL*
took
the
head
of
his
son
between
his
two
hands
,
drew
him
forward
,
and
*NL*
kissing
his
forehead
several
times
said
,
``
Oh
,
yes
,
yes
,
I
bless
you
in
*NL*
my
own
name

and
in
the
name
of
three
generations
of
irreproachable
*NL*
men
,
who
say
through
me
,
`
The
edifice
which
misfortune
has
destroyed
,
*NL*
providence
may
build
up
again
.
'
On
seeing
me
die
such
a
death
,
the
most
*NL*
inexorable
will
have
pity
on
you
.
To
you
,
perhaps
,
they
will
accord
the
*NL*
time
they
have
refused
to
me
.
Then
do
your
best
to
keep
our
name
free
*NL*
from
dishonor

Go
to
work

labor

young
man

struggle
ardently
and
*NL*
courageously
;
live

from

the

augment

Reflect
how
glorious
a
day
*NL*
it
will
be
,
how
grand

how
solemn
,
that
day
of
complete
restoration

on

you
will
say
in

office

`
My
father
died
because
he
could
*NL*
not
do
what
I
have
this
day
done
;
but
he
died
calmly
and
peaceably
,
*NL*
because
in
dying
he
knew
what
I
should
do
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
My

cried
the
young
man
,
``
why

you
not

*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I

all

into

if

live
I
am
only
a
man
who
his
*NL*
broken
his

failed
in

in

only

If

I

remember

Maximilian
,
my
corpse
is
that
of
*NL*
an
honest
but
unfortunate
man

Living

my

would
avoid
my

house

dead

all
Marseilles
will
follow
me
in
tears
to

Living

would
feel

you
may
raise
your
head
*NL*

say

I
am
the
son

him
you
killed

*NL*
he
has
been
compelled
to
break
his

*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
uttered
a
groan
,
but
appeared
resigned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
,
''
said
Morrel
,
``
leave
me
alone

and
endeavor
to
keep
your

sister
away

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
not
see
my
sister
once
more

asked
Maximilian
.
A
last
*NL*
but
final
hope
was
concealed
by
the
young
man
in
the
effect
of
this
*NL*
interview
,
and
therefore
he
had
suggested
it
.
Morrel
shook
his
head
.
``
I
*NL*
saw
her
this
morning
,
and
bade
her
adieu

*NL*
*NL*
``
Have

Maximilian
in

The

will
not

offered

The
young
man
remained
standing
and
motionless
,
having
but
the
force
of
*NL*
will
and
not
the
power
of
execution
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hear

said
his
father
.
``

I
must
be
*NL*
killed
in
the
assault

would
you
not

to

,
as
you
said
just
now
,
*NL*
`
Go

for
you

dishonored
by

and
death

preferable

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
''
said
the
young
man
,
``
yes
;
''
and
once
again
embracing
his
*NL*
father
with
convulsive
pressure
,
he
said
,
``
Be
it
so
,
my
father
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
rushed
out
of
the
study
.
When
his
son
had
left
him
,
Morrel
*NL*
remained
an
instant
standing
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
door
;
then
*NL*
putting
forth
his
arm
,
he
pulled
the
bell
.
After
a
moment
's
interval
,
*NL*
Cocles
appeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
no
longer
the
same
man
--
the
fearful
revelations
of
the
three
last
*NL*
days
had
crushed
him
.
This
thought
--
the
house
of
Morrel
is
about
to
stop
*NL*
payment
--
bent
him
to
the
earth
more
than
twenty
years
would
otherwise
*NL*
have
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
worthy
Cocles
,
''
said
Morrel
in
a
tone
impossible
to
describe
,
``
do
*NL*
you
remain
in
the
ante-chamber
.
When
the
gentleman
who
came
three
months
*NL*
ago
--
the
agent
of
Thomson
&
French
--
arrives
,
announce
his
arrival
to
*NL*
me
.
''
Cocles
made
no
reply
;
he
made
a
sign
with
his
head
,
went
into
the
*NL*
anteroom
,
and
seated
himself
.
Morrel
fell
back
in
his
chair
,
his
eyes
*NL*
fixed
on
the
clock
;
there
were
seven
minutes
left
,
that
was
all
.
The
*NL*
hand
moved
on
with
incredible
rapidity
,
he
seemed
to
see
its
motion
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
passed
in
the
mind
of
this
man
at
the
supreme
moment
of
his
agony
*NL*
can
not
be
told
in
words
.
He
was
still
comparatively
young
,
he
was
*NL*
surrounded
by
the
loving
care
of
a
devoted
family
,
but
he
had
convinced
*NL*
himself
by
a
course
of
reasoning
,
illogical
perhaps
,
yet
certainly
*NL*
plausible
,
that
he
must
separate
himself
from
all
he
held
dear
in
the
*NL*
world
,
even
life
itself
.
To
form
the
slightest
idea
of
his
feelings
,
one
*NL*
must
have
seen
his
face
with
its
expression
of
enforced
resignation
and
*NL*
its
tear-moistened
eyes
raised
to
heaven
.
The
minute
hand
moved
on
.
*NL*
The
pistols
were
loaded
;
he
stretched
forth
his
hand
,
took
one
up
,
and
*NL*
murmured
his
daughter
's
name
.
Then
he
laid
it
down
seized
his
pen
,
and
*NL*
wrote
a
few
words
.
It
seemed
to
him
as
if
he
had
not
taken
a
sufficient
*NL*
farewell
of
his
beloved
daughter
.
Then
he
turned
again
to
the
clock
,
*NL*
counting
time
now
not
by
minutes
,
but
by
seconds
.
He
took
up
the
deadly
*NL*
weapon
again
,
his
lips
parted
and
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
clock
,
and
then
*NL*
shuddered
at
the
click
of
the
trigger
as
he
cocked
the
pistol
.
At
this
*NL*
moment
of
mortal
anguish
the
cold
sweat
came
forth
upon
his
brow
,
a
pang
*NL*
stronger
than
death
clutched
at
his
heart-strings
.
He
heard
the
door
of
*NL*
the
staircase
creak
on
its
hinges
--
the
clock
gave
its
warning
to
strike
*NL*
eleven
--
the
door
of
his
study
opened
;
Morrel
did
not
turn
round
--
he
*NL*
expected
these
words
of
Cocles
,
``
The
agent
of
Thomson
&
French
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
placed
the
muzzle
of
the
pistol
between
his
teeth
.
Suddenly
he
heard
*NL*
a
cry
--
it
was
his
daughter
's
voice
.
He
turned
and
saw
Julie
.
The
pistol
*NL*
fell
from
his
hands
.
``
My
father
!
''
cried
the
young
girl
,
out
of
breath
,
*NL*
and
half
dead
with
joy
--
``
saved
,
you
are
saved
!
''
And
she
threw
herself
*NL*
into
his
arms
,
holding
in
her
extended
hand
a
red
,
netted
silk
purse
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Saved
,
my
child
!
''
said
Morrel
;
``
what
do
you
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
saved
--
saved
!
See
,
see
!
''
said
the
young
girl
.
*NL*
*NL*
Morrel
took
the
purse
,
and
started
as
he
did
so
,
for
a
vague
remembrance
*NL*
reminded
him
that
it
once
belonged
to
himself
.
At
one
end
was
the
*NL*
receipted
bill
for
the
287,000
francs
,
and
at
the
other
was
a
diamond
*NL*
as
large
as
a
hazel-nut
,
with
these
words
on
a
small
slip
of
*NL*
parchment
:
--
Julie
's
Dowry
.
*NL*
*NL*
Morrel
passed
his
hand
over
his
brow
;
it
seemed
to
him
a
dream
.
At
this
*NL*
moment
the
clock
struck
eleven
.
He
felt
as
if
each
stroke
of
the
hammer
*NL*
fell
upon
his
heart
.
``
Explain
,
my
child
,
''
he
said
,
``
Explain
,
my
child
,
''
*NL*
he
said
,
``
explain
--
where
did
you
find
this
purse
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
a
house
in
the
Allees
de
Meillan
,
No.
15
,
on
the
corner
of
a
*NL*
mantelpiece
in
a
small
room
on
the
fifth
floor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
''
cried
Morrel
,
``
this
purse
is
not
yours
!
''
Julie
handed
to
her
*NL*
father
the
letter
she
had
received
in
the
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
did
you
go
alone
?
''
asked
Morrel
,
after
he
had
read
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Emmanuel
accompanied
me
,
father
.
He
was
to
have
waited
for
me
at
the
*NL*
corner
of
the
Rue
de
Musee
,
but
,
strange
to
say
,
he
was
not
there
when
I
*NL*
returned
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
Morrel
!
''
exclaimed
a
voice
on
the
stairs
.
--
``
Monsieur
Morrel
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
his
voice
!
''
said
Julie
.
At
this
moment
Emmanuel
entered
,
his
*NL*
countenance
full
of
animation
and
joy
.
``
The
Pharaon
!
''
he
cried
;
``
the
*NL*
Pharaon
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
--
what
--
the
Pharaon
!
Are
you
mad
,
Emmanuel
?
You
know
the
vessel
is

lost

*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Pharaon
,
sir
--
they
signal
the
Pharaon
!
The
Pharaon
is
entering
the
*NL*
harbor

''
Morrel
fell
back
in
his
chair
,
his
strength
was
failing
him
;
*NL*
his
understanding
weakened
by
such
events
,
refused
to
comprehend
such
*NL*
incredible
,
unheard-of
,
fabulous
facts
.
But
his
son
came
in
.
``
Father
,
''
*NL*
cried
Maximilian
,
``
how
could
you
say
the
Pharaon
was
lost
?
The
lookout
*NL*
has
signalled
her
,
and
they
say
she
is
now
coming
into
port
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
friends

''
said
Morrel
,
``
if
this
be
so
,
it
must
be
a
miracle
of
*NL*
heaven
!
Impossible
,
impossible
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
what
was
real
and
not
less
incredible
was
the
purse
he
held
in
his
*NL*
hand
,
the
acceptance
receipted
--
the
splendid
diamond
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
sir
,
''
exclaimed
Cocles
,
``
what
can
it
mean
?
--
the
Pharaon
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
dear
ones
,
''
said
Morrel
,
rising
from
his
seat
,
``
let
us
go
and
*NL*
see
,
and
heaven
have
pity
upon
us
if
it
be
false
intelligence
!
''
They
all
*NL*
went
out
,
and
on
the
stairs
met
Madame
Morrel
,
who
had
been
afraid
to
go
*NL*
up
into
the
study
.
In
a
moment
they
were
at
the
Cannebiere
.
There
was
a
*NL*
crowd
on
the
pier
.
All
the
crowd
gave
way
before
Morrel
.
``
The
Pharaon
,
*NL*
the
Pharaon
!
''
said
every
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
wonderful
to
see
,
in
front
of
the
tower
of
Saint-Jean
,
was
a
*NL*
ship
bearing
on
her
stern
these
words
,
printed
in
white
letters
,
``
The
*NL*
Pharaon
,
Morrel
&
Son
,
of
Marseilles
.
''
She
was
the
exact
duplicate
of
*NL*
the
other
Pharaon
,
and
loaded
,
as
that
had
been
,
with
cochineal
and
*NL*
indigo
.
She
cast
anchor
,
clued
up
sails
,
and
on
the
deck
was
Captain
*NL*
Gaumard
giving
orders
,
and
good
old
Penelon
making
signals
to
M.
Morrel
.
*NL*
To
doubt
any
longer
was
impossible
;
there
was
the
evidence
of
the
*NL*
senses
,
and
ten
thousand
persons
who
came
to
corroborate
the
testimony
.
*NL*
As
Morrel
and
his
son
embraced
on
the
pier-head
,
in
the
presence
and
*NL*
amid
the
applause
of
the
whole
city
witnessing
this
event
,
a
man
,
with
*NL*
his
face
half-covered
by
a
black
beard
,
and
who
,
concealed
behind
the
*NL*
sentry-box
,
watched
the
scene
with
delight
,
uttered
these
words
in
a
low
*NL*
tone
:
``
Be
happy
,
noble
heart
,
be
blessed
for
all
the
good
thou
hast
done
*NL*
and
wilt
do
hereafter
,
and
let
my
gratitude
remain
in
obscurity
like
*NL*
your
good
deeds
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
with
a
smile
expressive
of
supreme
content
,
he
left
his
*NL*
hiding-place
,
and
without
being
observed
,
descended
one
of
the
flights
*NL*
of
steps
provided
for
debarkation
,
and
hailing
three
times
,
shouted
*NL*
``
Jacopo
,
Jacopo
,
Jacopo
!
''
Then
a
launch
came
to
shore
,
took
him
on
*NL*
board
,
and
conveyed
him
to
a
yacht
splendidly
fitted
up
,
on
whose
deck
*NL*
he
sprung
with
the
activity
of
a
sailor
;
thence
he
once
again
looked
*NL*
towards
Morrel
,
who
,
weeping
with
joy
,
was
shaking
hands
most
cordially
*NL*
with
all
the
crowd
around
him
,
and
thanking
with
a
look
the
unknown
*NL*
benefactor
whom
he
seemed
to
be
seeking
in
the
skies
.
``
And
now
,
''
said
*NL*
the
unknown
,
``
farewell
kindness
,
humanity
,
and
gratitude
!
Farewell
to
*NL*
all
the
feelings
that
expand
the
heart
!
I
have
been
heaven
's
substitute
*NL*
to
recompense
the
good
--
now
the
god
of
vengeance
yields
to
me
his
power
*NL*
to
punish
the
wicked
!
''
At
these
words
he
gave
a
signal
,
and
,
as
if
only
*NL*
awaiting
this
signal
,
the
yacht
instantly
put
out
to
sea

*NL*
Towards
the
beginning
of
the
year
1838
,
two
young
men
belonging
to
the
*NL*
first
society
of
Paris
,
the
Vicomte
Albert
de
Morcerf
and
the
Baron
*NL*
Franz
d'Epinay
,
were
at
Florence
.
They
had
agreed
to
see
the
Carnival
at
*NL*
Rome
that
year
,
and
that
Franz
,
who
for
the
last
three
or
four
years
*NL*
had
inhabited
Italy
,
should
act
as
cicerone
to
Albert
.
As
it
is
no
*NL*
inconsiderable
affair
to
spend
the
Carnival
at
Rome
,
especially
when
*NL*
you
have
no
great
desire
to
sleep
on
the
Piazza
del
Popolo
,
or
the
Campo
*NL*
Vaccino
,
they
wrote
to
Signor
Pastrini
,
the
proprietor
of
the
Hotel
de
*NL*
Londres
,
Piazza
di
Spagna
,
to
reserve
comfortable
apartments
for
them
.
*NL*
Signor
Pastrini
replied
that
he
had
only
two
rooms
and
a
parlor
on
the
*NL*
third
floor
,
which
he
offered
at
the
low
charge
of
a
louis
per
diem
.
*NL*
They
accepted
his
offer
;
but
wishing
to
make
the
best
use
of
the
time
*NL*
that
was
left
,
Albert
started
for
Naples
.
As
for
Franz
,
he
remained
at
*NL*
Florence
,
and
after
having
passed
a
few
days
in
exploring
the
paradise
*NL*
of
the
Cascine
,
and
spending
two
or
three
evenings
at
the
houses
of
*NL*
the
Florentine
nobility
,
he
took
a
fancy
into
his
head
-LRB-
having
*NL*
already
visited
Corsica
,
the
cradle
of
Bonaparte
-RRB-
to
visit
Elba
,
the
*NL*
waiting-place
of
Napoleon
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
evening
he
cast
off
the
painter
of
a
sailboat
from
the
iron
ring
*NL*
that
secured
it
to
the
dock
at
Leghorn
,
wrapped
himself
in
his
coat
and
*NL*
lay
down
,
and
said
to
the
crew
,
--
``
To
the
Island
of
Elba
!
''
The
boat
shot
*NL*
out
of
the
harbor
like
a
bird
and
the
next
morning
Franz
disembarked
at
*NL*
Porto-Ferrajo
.
He
traversed
the
island
,
after
having
followed
the
*NL*
traces
which
the
footsteps
of
the
giant
have
left
,
and
re-embarked
*NL*
for
Marciana
.
Two
hours
after
he
again
landed
at
Pianosa
,
where
he
was
*NL*
assured
that
red
partridges
abounded
.
The
sport
was
bad
;
Franz
only
*NL*
succeeded
in
killing
a
few
partridges
,
and
,
like
every
unsuccessful
*NL*
sportsman
,
he
returned
to
the
boat
very
much
out
of
temper
.
``
Ah
,
if
your
*NL*
excellency
chose
,
''
said
the
captain
,
``
you
might
have
capital
sport
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
see
that
island
?
''
continued
the
captain
,
pointing
to
a
conical
*NL*
pile
rising
from
the
indigo
sea
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
is
this
island
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Island
of
Monte
Cristo
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
have
no
permission
to
shoot
over
this
island
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
excellency
does
not
require
a
permit
,
for
the
island
is
*NL*
uninhabited
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
indeed
!
''
said
the
young
man
.
``
A
desert
island
in
the
midst
of
the
*NL*
Mediterranean
must
be
a
curiosity
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
very
natural
;
this
island
is
a
mass
of
rocks
,
and
does
not
*NL*
contain
an
acre
of
land
capable
of
cultivation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
whom
does
this
island
belong
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
Tuscany
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
game
shall
I
find
there
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thousands
of
wild
goats
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
live
upon
the
stones
,
I
suppose
,
''
said
Franz
with
an
incredulous
*NL*
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
but
by
browsing
the
shrubs
and
trees
that
grow
out
of
the
crevices
*NL*
of
the
rocks
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
can
I
sleep
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
shore
in
the
grottos
,
or
on
board
in
your
cloak
;
besides
,
if
your
*NL*
excellency
pleases
,
we
can
leave
as
soon
as
you
like
--
we
can
sail
as
*NL*
well
by
night
as
by
day
,
and
if
the
wind
drops
we
can
use
our
oars
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
Franz
had
sufficient
time
,
and
his
apartments
at
Rome
were
not
*NL*
yet
available
,
he
accepted
the
proposition
.
Upon
his
answer
in
the
*NL*
affirmative
,
the
sailors
exchanged
a
few
words
together
in
a
low
tone
.
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
asked
he
,
``
what
now
?
Is
there
any
difficulty
in
the
way
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
replied
the
captain
,
``
but
we
must
warn
your
excellency
that
the
*NL*
island
is
an
infected
port

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monte

uninhabited

serves
occasionally
as
a
refuge
*NL*
for
the
smugglers
and
pirates
who
come
from
Corsica
,
Sardinia
,
and
*NL*
Africa
,
and
if
it
becomes
known
that
we
have
been
there
,
we
shall
have
*NL*
to
perform
quarantine
for
six
days
on
our
return
to
Leghorn

*NL*
*NL*
``
The
deuce

That
puts
a
different
face
on
the
matter

Six
days
!
Why
,
*NL*
that
's
as
long
as
the
Almighty
took
to
make
the
world

Too
long

*NL*
wait

too
long

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
who
will
say
your
excellency
has
been
to
Monte

?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

I
shall
not

cried
Franz
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nor
I

chorused
the
sailors
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
steer
for
Monte
Cristo

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
captain
gave
his
orders
,
the
helm
was
put
up
,
and
the
boat
was
soon
*NL*
sailing
in
the
direction
of
the
island
.
Franz
waited
until
all
was
in
*NL*
order
,
and
when
the
sail
was
filled
,
and
the
four
sailors
had
taken
*NL*
their
places
--
three
forward
,
and
one
at
the
helm
--
he
resumed
the
*NL*
conversation
.
``
Gaetano
,
''
said
he
to
the
captain
,
``
you
tell
me
Monte
*NL*
Cristo
serves
as
a
refuge
for
pirates

are

seems
to
me

a
very
*NL*
different
kind
of
game
from
the
goats

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
your
excellency
,
and
it
is
true
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
knew
there
were
smugglers
,
but
I
thought
that
since
the
capture
of
*NL*
Algiers
,
and
the
destruction
of
the
regency
,
pirates
existed
only
in
the
*NL*
romances
of
Cooper
and
Captain
Marryat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
excellency
is
mistaken
;
there
are
pirates
,
like
the
bandits
who
*NL*
were
believed
to
have
been
exterminated
by
Pope
Leo
XII.
,
and
who
yet
,
*NL*
every
day
,
rob
travellers
at
the
gates
of
Rome
.
Has
not
your
excellency
*NL*
heard
that
the
French
charge
d'affaires
was
robbed
six
months
ago
within
*NL*
five
hundred
paces
of
Velletri
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
I
heard
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
if
,
like
us
,
your
excellency
lived
at
Leghorn
,
you
would
*NL*
hear
,
from
time
to
time
,
that
a
little
merchant
vessel
,
or
an
English
*NL*
yacht
that
was
expected
at
Bastia
,
at
Porto-Ferrajo
,
or
at
Civita
*NL*
Vecchia
,
has
not
arrived
;
no
one
knows
what
has
become
of
it
,
but
,
*NL*
doubtless
,
it
has
struck
on
a
rock
and
foundered
.
Now
this
rock
it
has
*NL*
met
has
been
a
long
and
narrow
boat
,
manned
by
six
or
eight
men
,
who
*NL*
have
surprised
and
plundered
it
,
some
dark
and
stormy
night
,
near
some
*NL*
desert
and
gloomy
island
,
as
bandits
plunder
a
carriage
in
the
recesses
*NL*
of
a
forest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
''
asked
Franz
,
who
lay
wrapped
in
his
cloak
at
the
bottom
of
the
*NL*
boat
,
``
why
do
not
those
who
have
been
plundered
complain
to
the
French
,
*NL*
Sardinian
,
or
Tuscan
governments
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
said
Gaetano
with
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
,
in
the
first
place
,
they
transfer
from
the
vessel
to
their
own
*NL*
boat
whatever
they
think
worth
taking
,
then
they
bind
the
crew
hand
and
*NL*
foot
,
they
attach
to
every
one
's
neck
a
four
and
twenty
pound
ball
,
a
*NL*
large
hole
is
chopped
in
the
vessel
's
bottom
,
and
then
they
leave
her
.
*NL*
At
the
end
of
ten
minutes
the
vessel
begins
to
roll
heavily
and
settle
*NL*
down
.
First
one
gun
'
l
goes
under
,
then
the
other
.
Then
they
lift
and
*NL*
sink
again
,
and
both
go
under
at
once
.
All
at
once
there
's
a
noise
like
*NL*
a
cannon
--
that
's
the
air
blowing
up
the
deck
.
Soon
the
water
rushes
*NL*
out
of
the
scupper-holes
like
a
whale
spouting
,
the
vessel
gives
a
last
*NL*
groan
,
spins
round
and
round
,
and
disappears
,
forming
a
vast
whirlpool
*NL*
in
the
ocean
,
and
then
all
is
over
,
so
that
in
five
minutes
nothing
but
*NL*
the
eye
of
God
can
see
the
vessel
where
she
lies
at
the
bottom
of
the
*NL*
sea
.
Do
you
understand
now
,
''
said
the
captain
,
``
why
no
complaints
are
*NL*
made
to
the
government
,
and
why
the
vessel
never
reaches
port
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
probable
that
if
Gaetano
had
related
this
previous
to
proposing
*NL*
the
expedition
,
Franz
would
have
hesitated
,
but
now
that
they
had
*NL*
started
,
he
thought
it
would
be
cowardly
to
draw
back
.
He
was
one
of
*NL*
those
men
who
do
not
rashly
court
danger
,
but
if
danger
presents
itself
,
*NL*
combat
it
with
the
most
unalterable
coolness
.
Calm
and
resolute
,
he
*NL*
treated
any
peril
as
he
would
an
adversary
in
a
duel
,
--
calculated
*NL*
its
probable
method
of
approach
;
retreated
,
if
at
all
,
as
a
point
of
*NL*
strategy
and
not
from
cowardice
;
was
quick
to
see
an
opening
for
attack
,
*NL*
and
won
victory
at
a
single
thrust
.
``
Bah
!
''
said
he
,
``
I
have
travelled
*NL*
through
Sicily
and
Calabria
--
I
have
sailed
two
months
in
the
*NL*
Archipelago
,
and
yet
I
never
saw
even
the
shadow
of
a
bandit
or
a
*NL*
pirate
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
not
tell
your
excellency
this
to
deter
you
from
your
project
,
''
*NL*
replied
Gaetano
,
``
but
you
questioned
me
,
and
I
have
answered
;
that
's
*NL*
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
and
your
conversation
is
most
interesting
;
and
as
I
wish
to
enjoy
*NL*
it
as
long
as
possible
,
steer
for
Monte
Cristo
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
wind
blew
strongly
,
the
boat
made
six
or
seven
knots
an
hour
,
and
*NL*
they
were
rapidly
reaching
the
end
of
their
voyage
.
As
they
drew
near
*NL*
the
island
seemed
to
lift
from
the
sea
,
and
the
air
was
so
clear
that
*NL*
they
could
already
distinguish
the
rocks
heaped
on
one
another
,
like
*NL*
cannon
balls
in
an
arsenal
,
with
green
bushes
and
trees
growing
in
the
*NL*
crevices
.
As
for
the
sailors
,
although
they
appeared
perfectly
tranquil
*NL*
yet
it
was
evident
that
they
were
on
the
alert
,
and
that
they
carefully
*NL*
watched
the
glassy
surface
over
which
they
were
sailing
,
and
on
which
a
*NL*
few
fishing-boats
,
with
their
white
sails
,
were
alone
visible
.
They
were
*NL*
within
fifteen
miles
of
Monte
Cristo
when
the
sun
began
to
set
behind
*NL*
Corsica
,
whose
mountains
appeared
against
the
sky
,
showing
their
rugged
*NL*
peaks
in
bold
relief
;
this
mass
of
rock
,
like
the
giant
Adamastor
,
rose
*NL*
dead
ahead
,
a
formidable
barrier
,
and
intercepting
the
light
that
gilded
*NL*
its
massive
peaks
so
that
the
voyagers
were
in
shadow
.
Little
by
little
*NL*
the
shadow
rose
higher
and
seemed
to
drive
before
it
the
last
rays
of
*NL*
the
expiring
day
;
at
last
the
reflection
rested
on
the
summit
of
the
*NL*
mountain
,
where
it
paused
an
instant
,
like
the
fiery
crest
of
a
volcano
,
*NL*
then
gloom
gradually
covered
the
summit
as
it
had
covered
the
base
,
and
*NL*
the
island
now
only
appeared
to
be
a
gray
mountain
that
grew
continually
*NL*
darker
;
half
an
hour
after
,
the
night
was
quite
dark
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fortunately
,
the
mariners
were
used
to
these
latitudes
,
and
knew
every
*NL*
rock
in
the
Tuscan
Archipelago
;
for
in
the
midst
of
this
obscurity
Franz
*NL*
was
not
without
uneasiness
--
Corsica
had
long
since
disappeared
,
and
*NL*
Monte
Cristo
itself
was
invisible
;
but
the
sailors
seemed
,
like
the
*NL*
lynx
,
to
see
in
the
dark
,
and
the
pilot
who
steered
did
not
evince
the
*NL*
slightest
hesitation
.
An
hour
had
passed
since
the
sun
had
set
,
when
*NL*
Franz
fancied
he
saw
,
at
a
quarter
of
a
mile
to
the
left
,
a
dark
mass
,
*NL*
but
he
could
not
precisely
make
out
what
it
was
,
and
fearing
to
excite
*NL*
the
mirth
of
the
sailors
by
mistaking
a
floating
cloud
for
land
,
he
*NL*
remained
silent
;
suddenly
a
great
light
appeared
on
the
strand
;
land
*NL*
might
resemble
a
cloud
,
but
the
fire
was
not
a
meteor
.
``
What
is
this
*NL*
light
?
''
asked
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hush
!
''
said
the
captain
;
``
it
is
a
fire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
told
me
the
island
was
uninhabited
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
said
there
were
no
fixed
habitations
on
it
,
but
I
said
also
that
it
*NL*
served
sometimes
as
a
harbor
for
smugglers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
for
pirates
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
for
pirates
,
''
returned
Gaetano
,
repeating
Franz
's
words
.
``
It
is
for
*NL*
that
reason
I
have
given
orders
to
pass
the
island
,
for
,
as
you
see
,
the
*NL*
fire
is
behind
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
this
fire
?
''
continued
Franz
.
``
It
seems
to
me
rather
reassuring
than
*NL*
otherwise
;
men
who
did
not
wish
to
be
seen
would
not
light
a
fire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
that
goes
for
nothing
,
''
said
Gaetano
.
``
If
you
can
guess
the
*NL*
position
of
the
island
in
the
darkness
,
you
will
see
that
the
fire
*NL*
can
not
be
seen
from
the
side
or
from
Pianosa
,
but
only
from
the
sea
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
think
,
then
,
this
fire
indicates
the
presence
of
unpleasant
*NL*
neighbors
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
what
we
must
find
out
,
''
returned
Gaetano
,
fixing
his
eyes
on
*NL*
this
terrestrial
star
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
you
find
out
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
shall
see
.
''
Gaetano
consulted
with
his
companions
,
and
after
five
*NL*
minutes
'
discussion
a
manoeuvre
was
executed
which
caused
the
vessel
to
*NL*
tack
about
,
they
returned
the
way
they
had
come
,
and
in
a
few
minutes
*NL*
the
fire
disappeared
,
hidden
by
an
elevation
of
the
land
.
The
pilot
*NL*
again
changed
the
course
of
the
boat
,
which
rapidly
approached
the
*NL*
island
,
and
was
soon
within
fifty
paces
of
it
.
Gaetano
lowered
the
sail
,
*NL*
and
the
boat
came
to
rest
.
All
this
was
done
in
silence
,
and
from
the
*NL*
moment
that
their
course
was
changed
not
a
word
was
spoken
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gaetano
,
who
had
proposed
the
expedition
,
had
taken
all
the
*NL*
responsibility
on
himself
;
the
four
sailors
fixed
their
eyes
on
him
,
*NL*
while
they
got
out
their
oars
and
held
themselves
in
readiness
to
row
*NL*
away
,
which
,
thanks
to
the
darkness
,
would
not
be
difficult
.
As
for
*NL*
Franz
,
he
examined
his
arms
with
the
utmost
coolness
;
he
had
two
*NL*
double-barrelled
guns
and
a
rifle
;
he
loaded
them
,
looked
at
the
*NL*
priming
,
and
waited
quietly
.
During
this
time
the
captain
had
thrown
off
*NL*
his
vest
and
shirt
,
and
secured
his
trousers
round
his
waist
;
his
feet
*NL*
were
naked
,
so
he
had
no
shoes
and
stockings
to
take
off
;
after
these
*NL*
preparations
he
placed
his
finger
on
his
lips
,
and
lowering
himself
*NL*
noiselessly
into
the
sea
,
swam
towards
the
shore
with
such
precaution
*NL*
that
it
was
impossible
to
hear
the
slightest
sound
;
he
could
only
*NL*
be
traced
by
the
phosphorescent
line
in
his
wake
.
This
track
soon
*NL*
disappeared
;
it
was
evident
that
he
had
touched
the
shore
.
Every
one
on
*NL*
board
remained
motionless
for
half
an
hour
,
when
the
same
luminous
track
*NL*
was
again
observed
,
and
the
swimmer
was
soon
on
board
.
``
Well
?
''
exclaimed
*NL*
Franz
and
the
sailors
in
unison
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
Spanish
smugglers
,
''
said
he
;
``
they
have
with
them
two
Corsican
*NL*
bandits
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
are
these
Corsican
bandits
doing
here
with
Spanish
smugglers
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas
,
''
returned
the
captain
with
an
accent
of
the
most
profound
pity
,
*NL*
``
we
ought
always
to
help
one
another
.
Very
often
the
bandits
are
hard
*NL*
pressed
by
gendarmes
or
carbineers
;
well
,
they
see
a
vessel
,
and
good
*NL*
fellows
like
us
on
board
,
they
come
and
demand
hospitality
of
us
;
you
*NL*
ca
n't
refuse
help
to
a
poor
hunted
devil
;
we
receive
them
,
and
for
*NL*
greater
security
we
stand
out
to
sea
.
This
costs
us
nothing
,
and
saves
*NL*
the
life
,
or
at
least
the
liberty
,
of
a
fellow-creature
,
who
on
the
*NL*
first
occasion
returns
the
service
by
pointing
out
some
safe
spot
where
*NL*
we
can
land
our
goods
without
interruption
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
said
Franz
,
``
then
you
are
a
smuggler
occasionally
,
Gaetano
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
excellency
,
we
must
live
somehow
,
''
returned
the
other
,
smiling
*NL*
impenetrably
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
know
the
men
who
are
now
on
Monte
Cristo
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
we
sailors
are
like
freemasons
,
and
recognize
each
other
by
*NL*
signs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
do
you
think
we
have
nothing
to
fear
if
we
land
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
at
all
;
smugglers
are
not
thieves
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
these
two
Corsican
bandits
?
''
said
Franz
,
calculating
the
chances
of
*NL*
peril
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
not
their
fault
that
they
are
bandits
,
but
that
of
the
*NL*
authorities
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
they
are
pursued
for
having
made
a
stiff
,
as
if
it
was
not
in
a
*NL*
Corsican
's
nature
to
revenge
himself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
by
having
made
a
stiff
?
--
having
assassinated
a
man
?
''
*NL*
said
Franz
,
continuing
his
investigation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
mean
that
they
have
killed
an
enemy
,
which
is
a
very
different
*NL*
thing
,
''
returned
the
captain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
the
young
man
,
``
let
us
demand
hospitality
of
these
*NL*
smugglers
and
bandits
.
Do
you
think
they
will
grant
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Without
doubt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
many
are
they
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Four
,
and
the
two
bandits
make
six
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
our
number
,
so
that
if
they
prove
troublesome
,
we
shall
be
able
to
*NL*
hold
them
in
check
;
so
,
for
the
last
time
,
steer
to
Monte
Cristo
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
your
excellency
will
permit
us
to
take
all
due
precautions
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
all
means
,
be
as
wise
as
Nestor
and
as
prudent
as
Ulysses
;
I
do
more
*NL*
than
permit
,
I
exhort
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Silence
,
then
!
''
said
Gaetano
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
one
obeyed
.
For
a
man
who
,
like
Franz
,
viewed
his
position
in
*NL*
its
true
light
,
it
was
a
grave
one
.
He
was
alone
in
the
darkness
with
*NL*
sailors
whom
he
did
not
know
,
and
who
had
no
reason
to
be
devoted
to
*NL*
him
;
who
knew
that
he
had
several
thousand
francs
in
his
belt
,
and
who
*NL*
had
often
examined
his
weapons
,
--
which
were
very
beautiful
,
--
if
not
with
*NL*
envy
,
at
least
with
curiosity
.
On
the
other
hand
,
he
was
about
to
land
,
*NL*
without
any
other
escort
than
these
men
,
on
an
island
which
had
,
indeed
,
*NL*
a
very
religious
name
,
but
which
did
not
seem
to
Franz
likely
to
afford
*NL*
him
much
hospitality
,
thanks
to
the
smugglers
and
bandits
.
The
history
*NL*
of
the
scuttled
vessels
,
which
had
appeared
improbable
during
the
day
,
*NL*
seemed
very
probable
at
night
;
placed
as
he
was
between
two
possible
*NL*
sources
of
danger
,
he
kept
his
eye
on
the
crew
,
and
his
gun
in
his
*NL*
hand
.
The
sailors
had
again
hoisted
sail
,
and
the
vessel
was
once
more
*NL*
cleaving
the
waves
.
Through
the
darkness
Franz
,
whose
eyes
were
now
more
*NL*
accustomed
to
it
,
could
see
the
looming
shore
along
which
the
boat
was
*NL*
sailing
,
and
then
,
as
they
rounded
a
rocky
point
,
he
saw
the
fire
more
*NL*
brilliant
than
ever
,
and
about
it
five
or
six
persons
seated
.
The
blaze
*NL*
illumined
the
sea
for
a
hundred
paces
around
.
Gaetano
skirted
the
light
,
*NL*
carefully
keeping
the
boat
in
the
shadow
;
then
,
when
they
were
opposite
*NL*
the
fire
,
he
steered
to
the
centre
of
the
circle
,
singing
a
fishing
*NL*
song
,
of
which
his
companions
sung
the
chorus
.
At
the
first
words
of
*NL*
the
song
the
men
seated
round
the
fire
arose
and
approached
the
*NL*
landing-place
,
their
eyes
fixed
on
the
boat
,
evidently
seeking
to
*NL*
know
who
the
new-comers
were
and
what
were
their
intentions
.
They
soon
*NL*
appeared
satisfied
and
returned
-LRB-
with
the
exception
of
one
,
who
*NL*
remained
at
the
shore
-RRB-
to
their
fire
,
at
which
the
carcass
of
a
goat
was
*NL*
roasting
.
When
the
boat
was
within
twenty
paces
of
the
shore
,
the
man
on
*NL*
the
beach
,
who
carried
a
carbine
,
presented
arms
after
the
manner
of
*NL*
a
sentinel
,
and
cried
,
``
Who
comes
there
?
''
in
Sardinian
.
Franz
coolly
*NL*
cocked
both
barrels
.
Gaetano
then
exchanged
a
few
words
with
this
man
*NL*
which
the
traveller
did
not
understand
,
but
which
evidently
concerned
*NL*
him
.
``
Will
your
excellency
give
your
name
,
or
remain
incognito
?
''
asked
*NL*
the
captain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
name
must
rest
unknown
,
--
merely
say
I
am
a
Frenchman
travelling
for
*NL*
pleasure
.
''
As
soon
as
Gaetano
had
transmitted
this
answer
,
the
sentinel
*NL*
gave
an
order
to
one
of
the
men
seated
round
the
fire
,
who
rose
and
*NL*
disappeared
among
the
rocks
.
Not
a
word
was
spoken
,
every
one
seemed
*NL*
occupied
,
Franz
with
his
disembarkment
,
the
sailors
with
their
sails
,
*NL*
the
smugglers
with
their
goat
;
but
in
the
midst
of
all
this
carelessness
*NL*
it
was
evident
that
they
mutually
observed
each
other
.
The
man
who
had
*NL*
disappeared
returned
suddenly
on
the
opposite
side
to
that
by
which
he
*NL*
had
left
;
he
made
a
sign
with
his
head
to
the
sentinel
,
who
,
turning
*NL*
to
the
boat
,
said
,
``
S'accommodi
.
''
The
Italian
s
`
accommodi
is
*NL*
untranslatable
;
it
means
at
once
,
``
Come
,
enter
,
you
are
welcome
;
make
*NL*
yourself
at
home
;
you
are
the
master
.
''
It
is
like
that
Turkish
phrase
*NL*
of
Moliere
's
that
so
astonished
the
bourgeois
gentleman
by
the
number
of
*NL*
things
implied
in
its
utterance
.
The
sailors
did
not
wait
for
a
second
*NL*
invitation
;
four
strokes
of
the
oar
brought
them
to
land
;
Gaetano
sprang
*NL*
to
shore
,
exchanged
a
few
words
with
the
sentinel
,
then
his
comrades
*NL*
disembarked
,
and
lastly
came
Franz
.
One
of
his
guns
was
swung
over
his
*NL*
shoulder
,
Gaetano
had
the
other
,
and
a
sailor
held
his
rifle
;
his
*NL*
dress
,
half
artist
,
half
dandy
,
did
not
excite
any
suspicion
,
and
,
*NL*
consequently
,
no
disquietude
.
The
boat
was
moored
to
the
shore
,
and
they
*NL*
advanced
a
few
paces
to
find
a
comfortable
bivouac
;
but
,
doubtless
,
*NL*
the
spot
they
chose
did
not
suit
the
smuggler
who
filled
the
post
of
*NL*
sentinel
,
for
he
cried
out
,
``
Not
that
way
,
if
you
please
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gaetano
faltered
an
excuse
,
and
advanced
to
the
opposite
side
,
while
*NL*
two
sailors
kindled
torches
at
the
fire
to
light
them
on
their
way
.
*NL*
They
advanced
about
thirty
paces
,
and
then
stopped
at
a
small
esplanade
*NL*
surrounded
with
rocks
,
in
which
seats
had
been
cut
,
not
unlike
*NL*
sentry-boxes
.
Around
in
the
crevices
of
the
rocks
grew
a
few
dwarf
oaks
*NL*
and
thick
bushes
of
myrtles
.
Franz
lowered
a
torch
,
and
saw
by
the
mass
*NL*
of
cinders
that
had
accumulated
that
he
was
not
the
first
to
discover
*NL*
this
retreat
,
which
was
,
doubtless
,
one
of
the
halting-places
of
the
*NL*
wandering
visitors
of
Monte
Cristo
.
As
for
his
suspicions
,
once
on
*NL*
terra
firma
,
once
that
he
had
seen
the
indifferent
,
if
not
friendly
,
*NL*
appearance
of
his
hosts
,
his
anxiety
had
quite
disappeared
,
or
rather
,
*NL*
at
sight
of
the
goat
,
had
turned
to
appetite
.
He
mentioned
this
to
*NL*
Gaetano
,
who
replied
that
nothing
could
be
more
easy
than
to
prepare
*NL*
a
supper
when
they
had
in
their
boat
,
bread
,
wine
,
half
a
dozen
*NL*
partridges
,
and
a
good
fire
to
roast
them
by
.
``
Besides
,
''
added
he
,
``
if
*NL*
the
smell
of
their
roast
meat
tempts
you
,
I
will
go
and
offer
them
two
*NL*
of
our
birds
for
a
slice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
a
born
diplomat
,
''
returned
Franz
;
``
go
and
try
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
the
sailors
had
collected
dried
sticks
and
branches
with
which
*NL*
they
made
a
fire
.
Franz
waited
impatiently
,
inhaling
the
aroma
of
the
*NL*
roasted
meat
,
when
the
captain
returned
with
a
mysterious
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Franz
,
``
anything
new
?
--
do
they
refuse
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
contrary
,
''
returned
Gaetano
,
``
the
chief
,
who
was
told
you
were
a
*NL*
young
Frenchman
,
invites
you
to
sup
with
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
observed
Franz
,
``
this
chief
is
very
polite
,
and
I
see
no
*NL*
objection
--
the
more
so
as
I
bring
my
share
of
the
supper
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it
is
not
that
;
he
has
plenty
,
and
to
spare
,
for
supper
;
but
he
*NL*
makes
one
condition
,
and
rather
a
peculiar
one
,
before
he
will
receive
*NL*
you
at
his
house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
His
house
?
Has
he
built
one
here
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
but
he
has
a
very
comfortable
one
all
the
same
,
so
they
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
this
chief
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
heard
talk
of
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Favorably
or
otherwise
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Both
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
deuce
!
--
and
what
is
this
condition
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
you
are
blindfolded
,
and
do
not
take
off
the
bandage
until
he
*NL*
himself
bids
you
.
''
Franz
looked
at
Gaetano
,
to
see
,
if
possible
,
what
he
*NL*
thought
of
this
proposal
.
``
Ah
,
''
replied
he
,
guessing
Franz
's
thought
,
``
I
*NL*
know
this
is
a
serious
matter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
should
you
do
in
my
place
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
,
who
have
nothing
to
lose
,
--
I
should
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
would
accept
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
were
it
only
out
of
curiosity
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
something
very
peculiar
about
this
chief
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
,
''
said
Gaetano
,
lowering
his
voice
,
``
I
do
not
know
if
what
they
*NL*
say
is
true
''
--
he
stopped
to
see
if
any
one
was
near
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
they
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
this
chief
inhabits
a
cavern
to
which
the
Pitti
Palace
is
*NL*
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
nonsense
!
''
said
Franz
,
reseating
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
no
nonsense
;
it
is
quite
true
.
Cama
,
the
pilot
of
the
Saint
*NL*
Ferdinand
,
went
in
once
,
and
he
came
back
amazed
,
vowing
that
such
*NL*
treasures
were
only
to
be
heard
of
in
fairy
tales
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
,
''
observed
Franz
,
``
that
with
such
stories
you
make
me
think
*NL*
of
Ali
Baba
's
enchanted
cavern
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
tell
you
what
I
have
been
told
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
advise
me
to
accept
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
do
n't
say
that
;
your
excellency
will
do
as
you
please
;
I
should
*NL*
be
sorry
to
advise
you
in
the
matter
.
''
Franz
pondered
the
matter
for
a
*NL*
few
moments
,
concluded
that
a
man
so
rich
could
not
have
any
intention
*NL*
of
plundering
him
of
what
little
he
had
,
and
seeing
only
the
prospect
*NL*
of
a
good
supper
,
accepted
.
Gaetano
departed
with
the
reply
.
Franz
was
*NL*
prudent
,
and
wished
to
learn
all
he
possibly
could
concerning
his
host
.
*NL*
He
turned
towards
the
sailor
,
who
,
during
this
dialogue
,
had
sat
gravely
*NL*
plucking
the
partridges
with
the
air
of
a
man
proud
of
his
office
,
*NL*
and
asked
him
how
these
men
had
landed
,
as
no
vessel
of
any
kind
was
*NL*
visible
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
mind
that
,
''
returned
the
sailor
,
``
I
know
their
vessel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
a
very
beautiful
vessel
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
not
wish
for
a
better
to
sail
round
the
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
what
burden
is
she
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
About
a
hundred
tons
;
but
she
is
built
to
stand
any
weather
.
She
is
*NL*
what
the
English
call
a
yacht
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
was
she
built
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
not
;
but
my
own
opinion
is
she
is
a
Genoese
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
did
a
leader
of
smugglers
,
''
continued
Franz
,
``
venture
to
build
*NL*
a
vessel
designed
for
such
a
purpose
at
Genoa
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
not
say
that
the
owner
was
a
smuggler
,
''
replied
the
sailor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
but
Gaetano
did
,
I
thought
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gaetano
had
only
seen
the
vessel
from
a
distance
,
he
had
not
then
*NL*
spoken
to
any
one

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
if
this
person
be
not
a
smuggler
,
who
is
he
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
wealthy
signor
,
who
travels
for
his
pleasure

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
''
thought
Franz
,
``
he
is
still
more
mysterious
,
since
the
two
*NL*
accounts
do
not
agree

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
his
name
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
ask
him
he
says
Sinbad
the
Sailor

but
I
doubt
if
it

his
real

.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sinbad
the
Sailor
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
where
does
he
reside

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
sea

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
country
does
he
come
from

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not

*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
ever
seen
him

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sometimes

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
sort
of
a
man
is
he
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
excellency
will
judge

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
will
he
receive
me

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
doubt
in
the
subterranean
palace
Gaetano
told
you
of
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
never
had
the
curiosity
,
when
you
have
landed
and
found
this

island
deserted

this
enchanted
palace
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
more
than
once
,
but
always
in
vain
;
we
examined
the
grotto
all
*NL*
over
,
but
we
never
could
find
the
slightest
trace
of
any
opening
;
they
*NL*
say
that
the
door
is
not
opened
by
a
key
,
but
a
magic
word
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Decidedly
,
''
muttered
Franz
,
``
this
is
an
Arabian
Nights
'
adventure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
His
excellency
waits
for
you
,
''
said
a
voice
,
which
he
recognized
as
*NL*
that
of
the
sentinel
.
He
was
accompanied
by
two
of
the
yacht
's
crew
.
*NL*
Franz
drew
his
handkerchief
from
his
pocket
,
and
presented
it
to
the
man
*NL*
who
had
spoken
to
him
.
Without
uttering
a
word
,
they
bandaged
his
eyes
*NL*
with
a
care
that
showed
their
apprehensions
of
his
committing
some
*NL*
indiscretion
.
Afterwards
he
was
made
to
promise
that
he
would
not
make
*NL*
the
least
attempt
to
raise
the
bandage
.
He
promised
.
Then
his
two
guides
*NL*
took
his
arms
,
and
he
went
on
,
guided
by
them
,
and
preceded
by
the
*NL*
sentinel
.
After
going
about
thirty
paces
,
he
smelt
the
appetizing
odor
*NL*
of
the
kid
that
was
roasting
,
and
knew
thus
that
he
was
passing
the
*NL*
bivouac
;
they
then
led
him
on
about
fifty
paces
farther
,
evidently
*NL*
advancing
towards
that
part
of
the
shore
where
they
would
not
allow
*NL*
Gaetano
to
go
--
a
refusal
he
could
now
comprehend
.
Presently
,
by
a
change
*NL*
in
the
atmosphere
,
he
knew
that
they
were
entering
a
cave
;
after
going
*NL*
on
for
a
few
seconds
more
he
heard
a
crackling
,
and
it
seemed
to
him
as
*NL*
though
the
atmosphere
again
changed
,
and
became
balmy
and
perfumed
.
At
*NL*
length
his
feet
touched
on
a
thick
and
soft
carpet
,
and
his
guides
let
*NL*
go
their
hold
of
him
.
There
was
a
moment
's
silence
,
and
then
a
voice
,
in
*NL*
excellent
French
,
although
,
with
a
foreign
accent
,
said
,
``
Welcome
,
sir
.
*NL*
I
beg
you
will
remove
your
bandage
.
''
It
may
be
supposed
,
then
,
Franz
*NL*
did
not
wait
for
a
repetition
of
this
permission
,
but
took
off
*NL*
the
handkerchief
,
and
found
himself
in
the
presence
of
a
man
from
*NL*
thirty-eight
to
forty
years
of
age
,
dressed
in
a
Tunisian
costume
--
that
*NL*
is
to
say
,
a
red
cap
with
a
long
blue
silk
tassel
,
a
vest
of
black
cloth
*NL*
embroidered
with
gold
,
pantaloons
of
deep
red
,
large
and
full
gaiters
*NL*
of
the
same
color
,
embroidered
with
gold
like
the
vest
,
and
yellow
*NL*
slippers
;
he
had
a
splendid
cashmere
round
his
waist
,
and
a
small
*NL*
sharp
and
crooked
cangiar
was
passed
through
his
girdle
.
Although
of
a
*NL*
paleness
that
was
almost
livid
,
this
man
had
a
remarkably
handsome
face
;
*NL*
his
eyes
were
penetrating
and
sparkling
;
his
nose
,
quite
straight
,
and
*NL*
projecting
direct
from
the
brow
,
was
of
the
pure
Greek
type
,
while
*NL*
his
teeth
,
as
white
as
pearls
,
were
set
off
to
admiration
by
the
black
*NL*
mustache
that
encircled
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
pallor
was
so
peculiar
,
that
it
seemed
to
pertain
to
one
who
had
*NL*
been
long
entombed
,
and
who
was
incapable
of
resuming
the
healthy
glow
*NL*
and
hue
of
life
.
He
was
not
particularly
tall
,
but
extremely
well
made
,
*NL*
and
,
like
the
men
of
the
south
,
had
small
hands
and
feet
.
But
what
*NL*
astonished
Franz
,
who
had
treated
Gaetano
's
description
as
a
fable
,
*NL*
was
the
splendor
of
the
apartment
in
which
he
found
himself
.
The
entire
*NL*
chamber
was
lined
with
crimson
brocade
,
worked
with
flowers
of
gold
.
In
*NL*
a
recess
was
a
kind
of
divan
,
surmounted
with
a
stand
of
Arabian
swords
*NL*
in
silver
scabbards
,
and
the
handles
resplendent
with
gems
;
from
the
*NL*
ceiling
hung
a
lamp
of
Venetian
glass
,
of
beautiful
shape
and
color
,
*NL*
while
the
feet
rested
on
a
Turkey
carpet
,
in
which
they
sunk
to
the
*NL*
instep
;
tapestry
hung
before
the
door
by
which
Franz
had
entered
,
and
*NL*
also
in
front
of
another
door
,
leading
into
a
second
apartment
which
*NL*
seemed
to
be
brilliantly
illuminated
.
The
host
gave
Franz
time
to
*NL*
recover
from
his
surprise
,
and
,
moreover
,
returned
look
for
look
,
not
*NL*
even
taking
his
eyes
off
him
.
``
Sir
,
''
he
said
,
after
a
pause
,
``
a
thousand
*NL*
excuses
for
the
precaution
taken
in
your
introduction
hither
;
but
as
,
*NL*
during
the
greater
portion
of
the
year
,
this
island
is
deserted
,
if
the
*NL*
secret
of
this
abode
were
discovered
.
I
should
doubtless
,
find
on
my
*NL*
return
my
temporary
retirement
in
a
state
of
great
disorder
,
which
would
*NL*
be
exceedingly
annoying
,
not
for
the
loss
it
occasioned
me
,
but
because
*NL*
I
should
not
have
the
certainty
I
now
possess
of
separating
myself
from
*NL*
all
the
rest
of
mankind
at
pleasure
.
Let
me
now
endeavor
to
make
you
*NL*
forget
this
temporary
unpleasantness
,
and
offer
you
what
no
doubt
you
*NL*
did
not
expect
to
find
here
--
that
is
to
say
,
a
tolerable
supper
and
*NL*
pretty
comfortable
beds
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ma
foi
,
my
dear
sir
,
''
replied
Franz
,
``
make
no
apologies
.
I
have
*NL*
always
observed
that
they
bandage
people
's
eyes
who
penetrate
enchanted
*NL*
palaces
,
for
instance
,
those
of
Raoul
in
the
`
Huguenots
,
'
and
really
*NL*
I
have
nothing
to
complain
of
,
for
what
I
see
makes
me
think
of
the
*NL*
wonders
of
the
`
Arabian
Nights
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas
,
I
may
say
with
Lucullus
,
if
I
could
have
anticipated
the
honor
of
*NL*
your
visit
,
I
would
have
prepared
for
it
.
But
such
as
is
my
hermitage
,
*NL*
it
is
at
your
disposal
;
such
as
is
my
supper
,
it
is
yours
to
share
,
if
*NL*
you
will

Ali
,
is
the
supper
ready
?
''
At
this
moment
the
tapestry
moved
*NL*
aside
,
and
a
Nubian
,
black
as
ebony
,
and
dressed
in
a
plain
white
tunic
,
*NL*
made
a
sign
to
his
master
that
all
was
prepared
in
the
dining-room
.
*NL*
``
Now
,
''
said
the
unknown
to
Franz
,
``
I
do
not
know
if
you
are
of
my
*NL*
opinion
,
but
I
think
nothing
is
more
annoying
than
to
remain
two
or
*NL*
three
hours
together
without
knowing
by
name
or
appellation
how
to
*NL*
address
one
another
.
Pray
observe
,
that
I
too
much
respect
the
laws
of
*NL*
hospitality
to
ask
your
name
or
title
.
I
only
request
you
to
give
me
one
*NL*
by
which
I
may
have
the
pleasure
of
addressing
you
.
As
for
myself
,
*NL*
that
I
may
put
you
at
your
ease
,
I
tell
you
that
I
am
generally
called
*NL*
`
Sinbad
the
Sailor
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
,
''
replied
Franz
,
``
will
tell
you
,
as
I
only
require
his
wonderful
*NL*
lamp
to
make
me
precisely
like
Aladdin
,
that
I
see
no
reason
why
at
this
*NL*
moment
I
should
not
be
called
Aladdin
.
That
will
keep
us
from
going
away
*NL*
from
the
East
whither
I
am
tempted
to
think
I
have
been
conveyed
by
some
*NL*
good
genius
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
Signor
Aladdin
,
''
replied
the
singular
amphitryon
,
``
you
*NL*
heard
our
repast
announced
,
will
you
now
take
the
trouble
to
enter
the
*NL*
dining-room
,
your
humble
servant
going
first
to
show
the
way
?
''
At
these
*NL*
words
,
moving
aside
the
tapestry
,
Sinbad
preceded
his
guest
.
Franz
*NL*
now
looked
upon
another
scene
of
enchantment
;
the
table
was
splendidly
*NL*
covered
,
and
once
convinced
of
this
important
point
he
cast
his
eyes
*NL*
around
him
.
The
dining-room
was
scarcely
less
striking
than
the
room
he
*NL*
had
just
left
;
it
was
entirely
of
marble
,
with
antique
bas-reliefs
of
*NL*
priceless
value
;
and
at
the
four
corners
of
this
apartment
,
which
was
*NL*
oblong
,
were
four
magnificent
statues
,
having
baskets
in
their
hands
.
*NL*
These
baskets
contained
four
pyramids
of
most
splendid
fruit
;
there
were
*NL*
Sicily
pine-apples
,
pomegranates
from
Malaga
,
oranges
from
the
Balearic
*NL*
Isles
,
peaches
from
France
,
and
dates
from
Tunis
.
The
supper
consisted
*NL*
of
a
roast
pheasant
garnished
with
Corsican
blackbirds
;
a
boar
's
ham
*NL*
with
jelly
,
a
quarter
of
a
kid
with
tartar
sauce
,
a
glorious
turbot
,
*NL*
and
a
gigantic
lobster
.
Between
these
large
dishes
were
smaller
ones
*NL*
containing
various
dainties
.
The
dishes
were
of
silver
,
and
the
plates
*NL*
of
Japanese
china
.
*NL*
*NL*
Franz
rubbed
his
eyes
in
order
to
assure
himself
that
this
was
not
a
*NL*
dream
.
Ali
alone
was
present
to
wait
at
table
,
and
acquitted
himself
*NL*
so
admirably
,
that
the
guest
complimented
his
host
thereupon
.
``
Yes
,
''
*NL*
replied
he
,
while
he
did
the
honors
of
the
supper
with
much
ease
and
*NL*
grace
--
``
yes
,
he
is
a
poor
devil
who
is
much
devoted
to
me
,
and
does
all
*NL*
he
can
to
prove
it
.
He
remembers
that
I
saved
his
life
,
and
as
he
has
a
*NL*
regard
for
his
head
,
he
feels
some
gratitude
towards
me
for
having
kept
*NL*
it
on
his
shoulders
.
''
Ali
approached
his
master
,
took
his
hand
,
and
*NL*
kissed
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
it
be
impertinent
,
Signor
Sinbad
,
''
said
Franz
,
``
to
ask
you
the
*NL*
particulars
of
this
kindness
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
they
are
simple
enough
,
''
replied
the
host
.
``
It
seems
the
fellow

had
been
caught
wandering
nearer
to
the
harem
of
the
Bey
of
Tunis
than
*NL*
etiquette
permits
to
one
of
his
color
,
and
he
was
condemned
by
the
bey
*NL*
to
have
his
tongue
cut
out
,
and
his
hand
and
head
cut
off
;
the
tongue
*NL*
the
first
day
,
the
hand
the
second
,
and
the
head
the
third
.
I
always
had
*NL*
a
desire
to
have
a
mute
in
my
service
,
so
learning
the
day
his
tongue
*NL*
was
cut
out
,
I
went
to
the
bey
,
and
proposed
to
give
him
for
Ali
a
*NL*
splendid
double-barreled
gun
which
I
knew
he
was
very
desirous
of
*NL*
having
.
He
hesitated
a
moment
,
he
was
so
very
desirous
to
complete
the
*NL*
poor
devil
's
punishment
.
But
when
I
added
to
the
gun
an
English
cutlass
*NL*
with
which
I
had
shivered
his
highness
's
yataghan
to
pieces
,
the
bey
*NL*
yielded
,
and
agreed
to
forgive
the
hand
and
head
,
but
on
condition
that
*NL*
the
poor
fellow
never
again
set
foot
in
Tunis
.
This
was
a
useless
clause
*NL*
in
the
bargain
,
for
whenever
the
coward
sees
the
first
glimpse
of
the
*NL*
shores
of
Africa
,
he
runs
down
below
,
and
can
only
be
induced
to
appear
*NL*
again
when
we
are
out
of
sight
of
that
quarter
of
the
globe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Franz
remained
a
moment
silent
and
pensive
,
hardly
knowing
what
to
think
*NL*
of
the
half-kindness
,
half-cruelty
,
with
which
his
host
related
the
*NL*
brief
narrative
.
``
And
like
the
celebrated
sailor
whose
name
you
have
*NL*
assumed
,
''
he
said
,
by
way
of
changing
the
conversation
,
``
you
pass
your
*NL*
life
in
travelling
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
I
made
a
vow
at
a
time
when
I
little
thought
I
should
ever
be
able
*NL*
to
accomplish
it
,
''
said
the
unknown
with
a
singular
smile
;
``
and
I
made
*NL*
some
others
also
which
I
hope
I
may
fulfil
in
due
season
.
''
Although
*NL*
Sinbad
pronounced
these
words
with
much
calmness
,
his
eyes
gave
forth
*NL*
gleams
of
extraordinary
ferocity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
suffered
a
great
deal
,
sir
?
''
said
Franz
inquiringly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sinbad
started
and
looked
fixedly
at
him
,
as
he
replied
,
``
What
makes
you
*NL*
suppose
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Everything
,
''
answered
Franz
,
--
``
your
voice
,
your
look
,
your
pallid
*NL*
complexion
,
and
even
the
life
you
lead
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
?
--
I
live
the
happiest
life
possible
,
the
real
life
of
a
pasha
.
I
am
*NL*
king
of
all
creation
.
I
am
pleased
with
one
place
,
and
stay
there
;
I
get
*NL*
tired
of
it
,
and
leave
it
;
I
am
free
as
a
bird
and
have
wings
like
*NL*
one
;
my
attendants
obey
my
slightest
wish
.
Sometimes
I
amuse
myself
by
*NL*
delivering
some
bandit
or
criminal
from
the
bonds
of
the
law
.
Then
I
*NL*
have
my
mode
of
dispensing
justice
,
silent
and
sure
,
without
respite
or
*NL*
appeal
,
which
condemns
or
pardons
,
and
which
no
one
sees
.
Ah
,
if
you
had
*NL*
tasted
my
life
,
you
would
not
desire
any
other
,
and
would
never
return
*NL*
to
the
world
unless
you
had
some
great
project
to
accomplish
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Revenge
,
for
instance
!
''
observed
Franz
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
unknown
fixed
on
the
young
man
one
of
those
looks
which
penetrate
*NL*
into
the
depth
of
the
heart
and
thoughts
.
``
And
why
revenge
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
,
''
replied
Franz
,
``
you
seem
to
me
like
a
man
who
,
persecuted
by
*NL*
society
,
has
a
fearful
account
to
settle
with
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
responded
Sinbad
,
laughing
with
his
singular
laugh
which
displayed
*NL*
his
white
and
sharp
teeth
.
``
You
have
not
guessed
rightly
.
Such
as
you
*NL*
see
me
I
am
,
a
sort
of
philosopher

and
one
day
perhaps
I
shall
go
to
*NL*
Paris
to
rival
Monsieur
Appert
,
and
the
little
man
in
the
blue
cloak
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
will
that
be
the
first
time
you
ever
took
that
journey
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
it
will
.
I
must
seem
to
you
by
no
means
curious
,
but
I
assure
you
*NL*
that
it
is
not
my
fault
I
have
delayed
it
so
long
--
it
will
happen
one
*NL*
day
or
the
other
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
do
you
propose
to
make
this
journey
very
shortly
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not

it
depends
on
circumstances
which
depend
on
certain

arrangements

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
like
to
be
there
at

I
will
endeavor

as
far
as
lies
in
my
power

liberal
hospitality

displayed

at
Monte

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
avail
myself
of
your
offer
with
pleasure

replied
the
host
,
*NL*
``
but

unfortunately

there

it

be

in

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
supper
appeared
to
have
been
supplied
solely
for
Franz
,
for
the
*NL*
unknown
scarcely
touched
one
or
two
dishes
of
the
splendid
banquet
to
*NL*
which
his
guest
did
ample
justice
.
Then
Ali
brought
on
the
dessert
,
or
*NL*
rather
took
the
baskets
from
the
hands
of
the
statues
and
placed
them
on
*NL*
the
table
.
Between
the
two
baskets
he
placed
a
small
silver
cup
with
*NL*
a
silver
cover
.
The
care
with
which
Ali
placed
this
cup
on
the
table
*NL*
roused
Franz
's
curiosity
.
He
raised
the
cover
and
saw
a
kind
of
greenish
*NL*
paste
,
something
like
preserved
angelica
,
but
which
was
perfectly
*NL*
unknown
to
him
.
He
replaced
the
lid
,
as
ignorant
of
what
the
cup
*NL*
contained
as
he
was
before
he
had
looked
at
it
,
and
then
casting
his
*NL*
eyes
towards
his
host
he
saw
him
smile
at
his
disappointment
.
``
You
*NL*
can
not
guess
,
''
said
he
,
``
what
there
is
in
that
small
vase
,
can
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
really
can
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
that
green
preserve
is
nothing
less
than
the
ambrosia
which
*NL*
Hebe
served
at
the
table
of
Jupiter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
''
replied
Franz
,
``
this
ambrosia
,
no
doubt
,
in
passing
through
*NL*
mortal
hands
has
lost
its
heavenly
appellation
and
assumed
a
human
name
;
*NL*
in
vulgar
phrase
,
what
may
you
term
this
composition
,
for
which
,
to
tell
*NL*
the
truth
,
I
do
not
feel
any
particular
desire
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
thus
it
is
that
our
material
origin
is
revealed
,
''
cried
Sinbad
;
``
we
*NL*
frequently
pass
so
near
to
happiness
without
seeing
,
without
regarding
*NL*
it
,
or
if
we
do
see
and
regard
it
,
yet
without
recognizing
it
.
Are
you
*NL*
a
man
for
the
substantials
,
and
is
gold
your
god
?
taste
this
,
and
the
*NL*
mines
of
Peru
,
Guzerat
,
and
Golconda
are
opened
to
you
.
Are
you
a
man
*NL*
of
imagination
--
a
poet
?
taste
this
,
and
the
boundaries
of
possibility
*NL*
disappear
;
the
fields
of
infinite
space
open
to
you
,
you
advance
free
in
*NL*
heart
,
free
in
mind
,
into
the
boundless
realms
of
unfettered
revery
.
Are
*NL*
you
ambitious
,
and
do
you
seek
after
the
greatnesses
of
the
earth
?
taste
*NL*
this
,
and
in
an
hour
you
will
be
a
king
,
not
a
king
of
a
petty
kingdom
*NL*
hidden
in
some
corner
of
Europe
like
France
,
Spain
,
or
England
,
but
king
*NL*
of
the
world
,
king
of
the
universe
,
king
of
creation

without
bowing
at
*NL*
the
feet
of
Satan
,
you
will
be
king
and
master
of
all
the
kingdoms
of
*NL*
the
earth
.
Is
it
not
tempting
what
I
offer
you
,
and
is
it
not
an
easy
*NL*
thing
,
since
it
is
only
to
do
thus
?
look
!
''
At
these
words
he
uncovered
*NL*
the
small
cup
which
contained
the
substance
so
lauded
,
took
a
*NL*
teaspoonful
of
the
magic
sweetmeat
,
raised
it
to
his
lips
,
and
swallowed
*NL*
it
slowly
with
his
eyes
half
shut
and
his
head
bent
backwards
.
Franz
did
*NL*
not
disturb
him
whilst
he
absorbed
his
favorite
sweetmeat
,
but
when
he
*NL*
had
finished
,
he
inquired
,
--
``
What
,
then
,
is
this
precious
stuff
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
ever
hear
,
''
he
replied
,
``
of
the
Old
Man
of
the
Mountain
,
who
*NL*
attempted
to
assassinate
Philip
Augustus
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
I
have
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
know
he
reigned
over
a
rich
valley
which
was
overhung
by
the
*NL*
mountain
whence
he
derived
his
picturesque
name
.
In
this
valley
were
*NL*
magnificent
gardens
planted
by
Hassen-ben-Sabah
,
and
in
these
gardens
*NL*
isolated
pavilions
.
Into
these
pavilions
he
admitted
the
elect
,
*NL*
and
there
,
says
Marco
Polo
,
gave
them
to
eat
a
certain
herb
,
which
*NL*
transported
them
to
Paradise
,
in
the
midst
of
ever-blooming
shrubs
,
*NL*
ever-ripe
fruit
,
and
ever-lovely
virgins
.
What
these
happy
persons
took
*NL*
for
reality
was
but
a
dream
;
but
it
was
a
dream
so
soft
,
so
voluptuous
,
*NL*
so
enthralling
,
that
they
sold
themselves
body
and
soul
to
him
who
gave
*NL*
it
to
them
,
and
obedient
to
his
orders
as
to
those
of
a
deity
,
struck
*NL*
down
the
designated
victim
,
died
in
torture
without
a
murmur
,
believing
*NL*
that
the
death
they
underwent
was
but
a
quick
transition
to
that
life
of
*NL*
delights
of
which
the
holy
herb
,
now
before
you
,
had
given
them
a
slight
*NL*
foretaste

*NL*
*NL*
``
Then

cried
Franz
,
``
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
That

of
Alexandria

the
hashish

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know

Franz
,
``
I
have
a
very
great
inclination

``
Judge
for

Signor
Aladdin

do
not
confine
yourself

trial

else
,
we
must
habituate
the
senses
to
a
*NL*
fresh
impression
,
gentle
or
violent
,
sad
or
joyous
.
There
is
a
struggle
*NL*
in
nature
against
this
divine
substance
,
--
in
nature
which
is
not
made
*NL*
for
joy
and
clings
to
pain

Nature
subdued
must
yield
in
the
combat
,
the
*NL*
dream
must
succeed
to
reality

and
then
the
dream
reigns
supreme
,
then
*NL*
the
dream
becomes

becomes

But
what

It
is
only
by
comparing

actual
being

of
the
assumed

you
would
desire
to
live
no

to
dream
thus
forever

When
you
return
to
this
mundane
sphere

your
visionary

you
would
seem

leave
a
Neapolitan
spring

to
quit
paradise
for
earth

heaven

*NL*
*NL*
Franz
's
only
reply
was
to
take
a
teaspoonful
of
the
marvellous
*NL*
preparation
,
about
as
much
in
quantity
as
his
host
had
eaten
,
and
lift
*NL*
it
to
his
mouth
.
``
Diable
!

he
said
,
after
having
swallowed
the
divine
*NL*
preserve
.
``
I
do
not
know
if
the
result
will
be
as
agreeable

you

describe

``
Because
your

*NL*
porter

truffles

assafoetida

Eh

no

nothing

you

They

both
arose

while

called

we
have
*NL*
occasionally
named

*NL*
which
to
distinguish

gave
some
orders
to
the
servant
,
Franz
entered
*NL*
still
another
apartment
.
It
was
simply
yet
richly
furnished
.
It
was
*NL*
round
,
and
a
large
divan
completely
encircled
it
.
Divan
,
walls
,
ceiling
,
*NL*
floor
,
were
all
covered
with
magnificent
skins
as
soft
and
downy
as
the
*NL*
richest
carpets
;
there
were
heavy-maned
lion-skins
from
Atlas
,
*NL*
striped
tiger-skins
from
Bengal
;
panther-skins
from
the
Cape
,
spotted
*NL*
beautifully
,
like
those
that
appeared
to
Dante
;
bear-skins
from
Siberia
,
*NL*
fox-skins
from
Norway
,
and
so
on
;
and
all
these
skins
were
strewn
in
*NL*
profusion
one
on
the
other
,
so
that
it
seemed
like
walking
over
the
most
*NL*
mossy
turf
,
or
reclining
on
the
most
luxurious
bed
.
Both
laid
themselves
*NL*
down
on
the
divan
;
chibouques
with
jasmine
tubes
and
amber
mouthpieces
*NL*
were
within
reach
,
and
all
prepared
so
that
there
was
no
need
to
smoke
*NL*
the
same
pipe
twice
.
Each
of
them
took
one
,
which
Ali
lighted
and
then
*NL*
retired
to
prepare
the
coffee
.
There
was
a
moment
's
silence
,
during
*NL*
which
Sinbad
gave
himself
up
to
thoughts
that
seemed
to
occupy
him
*NL*
incessantly
,
even
in
the
midst
of
his
conversation
;
and
Franz
abandoned
*NL*
himself
to
that
mute
revery
,
into
which
we
always
sink
when
smoking
*NL*
excellent
tobacco
,
which
seems
to
remove
with
its
fume
all
the
troubles
*NL*
of
the
mind
,
and
to
give
the
smoker
in
exchange
all
the
visions
of
the
*NL*
soul
.
Ali
brought
in
the
coffee
.
``
How
do
you
take
it
?
''
inquired
the
*NL*
unknown
;
``
in
the
French
or
Turkish
style
,
strong
or
weak
,
sugar
or
none
,
*NL*
cool
or
boiling
?
As
you
please
;
it
is
ready
in
all
ways
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
take
it
in
the
Turkish
style
,
''
replied
Franz
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
are
right
,
''
said
his
host
;
``
it
shows
you
have
a
tendency
for
an
*NL*
Oriental
life
.
Ah
,
those
Orientals
;
they
are
the
only
men
who
know
how
*NL*
to
live
.
As
for
me
,
''
he
added
,
with
one
of
those
singular
smiles
which
*NL*
did
not
escape
the
young
man
,
``
when
I
have
completed
my
affairs
in
*NL*
Paris
,
I
shall
go
and
die
in
the
East
;
and
should
you
wish
to
see
me
*NL*
again
,
you
must
seek
me
at
Cairo
,
Bagdad
,
or
Ispahan
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ma
foi
,
''
said
Franz
,
``
it
would
be
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
;
for
I
*NL*
feel
eagle
's
wings
springing
out
at
my
shoulders
,
and
with
those
wings
I
*NL*
could
make
a
tour
of
the
world
in
four
and
twenty
hours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
yes
,
the
hashish
is
beginning
its
work
.
Well
,
unfurl
your
wings
,
*NL*
and
fly
into
superhuman
regions
;
fear
nothing
,
there
is
a
watch
over
*NL*
you
;
and
if
your
wings
,
like
those
of
Icarus
,
melt
before
the
sun
,
we
*NL*
are
here
to
ease
your
fall
.
''
He
then
said
something
in
Arabic
to
Ali
,
*NL*
who
made
a
sign
of
obedience
and
withdrew
,
but
not
to
any
distance
.
As
*NL*
to
Franz
a
strange
transformation
had
taken
place
in
him
.
All
the
bodily
*NL*
fatigue
of
the
day
,
all
the
preoccupation
of
mind
which
the
events
of
*NL*
the
evening
had
brought
on
,
disappeared
as
they
do
at
the
first
approach
*NL*
of
sleep
,
when
we
are
still
sufficiently
conscious
to
be
aware
of
the
*NL*
coming
of
slumber
.
His
body
seemed
to
acquire
an
airy
lightness
,
his
*NL*
perception
brightened
in
a
remarkable
manner
,
his
senses
seemed
to
*NL*
redouble
their
power
,
the
horizon
continued
to
expand
;
but
it
was
not
*NL*
the
gloomy
horizon
of
vague
alarms
,
and
which
he
had
seen
before
he
*NL*
slept
,
but
a
blue
,
transparent
,
unbounded
horizon
,
with
all
the
blue
of
*NL*
the
ocean
,
all
the
spangles
of
the
sun
,
all
the
perfumes
of
the
summer
*NL*
breeze
;
then
,
in
the
midst
of
the
songs
of
his
sailors
,
--
songs
so
clear
*NL*
and
sonorous
,
that
they
would
have
made
a
divine
harmony
had
their
notes
*NL*
been
taken
down
,
--
he
saw
the
Island
of
Monte
Cristo
,
no
longer
as
a
*NL*
threatening
rock
in
the
midst
of
the
waves
,
but
as
an
oasis
in
the
*NL*
desert
;
then
,
as
his
boat
drew
nearer
,
the
songs
became
louder
,
for
an
*NL*
enchanting
and
mysterious
harmony
rose
to
heaven
,
as
if
some
Loreley
had
*NL*
decreed
to
attract
a
soul
thither
,
or
Amphion
,
the
enchanter
,
intended
*NL*
there
to
build
a
city
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
the
boat
touched
the
shore
,
but
without
effort
,
without
shock
,
*NL*
as
lips
touch
lips
;
and
he
entered
the
grotto
amidst
continued
strains
*NL*
of
most
delicious
melody
.
He
descended
,
or
rather
seemed
to
descend
,
*NL*
several
steps
,
inhaling
the
fresh
and
balmy
air
,
like
that
which
may
be
*NL*
supposed
to
reign
around
the
grotto
of
Circe
,
formed
from
such
perfumes
*NL*
as
set
the
mind
a
dreaming
,
and
such
fires
as
burn
the
very
senses
;
and
*NL*
he
saw
again
all
he
had
seen
before
his
sleep
,
from
Sinbad
,
his
singular
*NL*
host
,
to
Ali
,
the
mute
attendant
;
then
all
seemed
to
fade
away
and
*NL*
become
confused
before
his
eyes
,
like
the
last
shadows
of
the
magic
*NL*
lantern
before
it
is
extinguished
,
and
he
was
again
in
the
chamber
of
*NL*
statues
,
lighted
only
by
one
of
those
pale
and
antique
lamps
which
watch
*NL*
in
the
dead
of
the
night
over
the
sleep
of
pleasure
.
They
were
the
*NL*
same
statues
,
rich
in
form
,
in
attraction
,
and
poesy
,
with
eyes
of
*NL*
fascination
,
smiles
of
love
,
and
bright
and
flowing
hair
.
They
were
*NL*
Phryne
,
Cleopatra
,
Messalina
,
those
three
celebrated
courtesans
.
Then
*NL*
among
them
glided
like
a
pure
ray
,
like
a
Christian
angel
in
the
midst
*NL*
of
Olympus
,
one
of
those
chaste
figures
,
those
calm
shadows
,
those
*NL*
soft
visions
,
which
seemed
to
veil
its
virgin
brow
before
these
marble
*NL*
wantons
.
Then
the
three
statues
advanced
towards
him
with
looks
of
love
,
*NL*
and
approached
the
couch
on
which
he
was
reposing
,
their
feet
hidden
in
*NL*
their
long
white
tunics
,
their
throats
bare
,
hair
flowing
like
waves
,
*NL*
and
assuming
attitudes
which
the
gods
could
not
resist
,
but
which
saints
*NL*
withstood
,
and
looks
inflexible
and
ardent
like
those
with
which
the
*NL*
serpent
charms
the
bird
;
and
then
he
gave
way
before
looks
that
held
him
*NL*
in
a
torturing
grasp
and
delighted
his
senses
as
with
a
voluptuous
kiss
.
*NL*
It
seemed
to
Franz
that
he
closed
his
eyes
,
and
in
a
last
look
about
him
*NL*
saw
the
vision
of
modesty
completely
veiled
;
and
then
followed
a
dream
*NL*
of
passion
like
that
promised
by
the
Prophet
to
the
elect
.
Lips
of
stone
*NL*
turned
to
flame
,
breasts
of
ice
became
like
heated
lava
,
so
that
to
*NL*
Franz
,
yielding
for
the
first
time
to
the
sway
of
the
drug
,
love
was
a
*NL*
sorrow
and
voluptuousness
a
torture
,
as
burning
mouths
were
pressed
to
*NL*
his
thirsty
lips
,
and
he
was
held
in
cool
serpent-like
embraces
.
The
*NL*
more
he
strove
against
this
unhallowed
passion
the
more
his
senses
*NL*
yielded
to
its
thrall
,
and
at
length
,
weary
of
a
struggle
that
taxed
his
*NL*
very
soul
,
he
gave
way
and
sank
back
breathless
and
exhausted
beneath
*NL*
the
kisses
of
these
marble
goddesses
,
and
the
enchantment
of
his
*NL*
marvellous
dream
.

Chapter
32
.
The
Waking
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Franz
returned
to
himself
,
he
seemed
still
to
be
in
a
dream
.
He
*NL*
thought
himself
in
a
sepulchre
,
into
which
a
ray
of
sunlight
in
pity
*NL*
scarcely
penetrated
.
He
stretched
forth
his
hand
,
and
touched
stone
;
he
*NL*
rose
to
his
seat
,
and
found
himself
lying
on
his
bournous
in
a
bed
of
*NL*
dry
heather
,
very
soft
and
odoriferous
.
The
vision
had
fled
;
and
as
if
*NL*
the
statues
had
been
but
shadows
from
the
tomb
,
they
had
vanished
at
*NL*
his
waking
.
He
advanced
several
paces
towards
the
point
whence
the
light
*NL*
came
,
and
to
all
the
excitement
of
his
dream
succeeded
the
calmness
of
*NL*
reality
.
He
found
that
he
was
in
a
grotto
,
went
towards
the
opening
,
and
*NL*
through
a
kind
of
fanlight
saw
a
blue
sea
and
an
azure
sky
.
The
air
and
*NL*
water
were
shining
in
the
beams
of
the
morning
sun
;
on
the
shore
the
*NL*
sailors
were
sitting
,
chatting
and
laughing
;
and
at
ten
yards
from
them
*NL*
the
boat
was
at
anchor
,
undulating
gracefully
on
the
water
.
There
for
*NL*
some
time
he
enjoyed
the
fresh
breeze
which
played
on
his
brow
,
and
*NL*
listened
to
the
dash
of
the
waves
on
the
beach
,
that
left
against
the
*NL*
rocks
a
lace
of
foam
as
white
as
silver
.
He
was
for
some
time
without
*NL*
reflection
or
thought
for
the
divine
charm
which
is
in
the
things
of
*NL*
nature
,
specially
after
a
fantastic
dream
;
then
gradually
this
view
*NL*
of
the
outer
world
,
so
calm
,
so
pure
,
so
grand
,
reminded
him
of
the
*NL*
illusiveness
of
his
vision
,
and
once
more
awakened
memory
.
He
recalled
*NL*
his
arrival
on
the
island
,
his
presentation
to
a
smuggler
chief
,
*NL*
a
subterranean
palace
full
of
splendor
,
an
excellent
supper
,
and
a
*NL*
spoonful
of
hashish
.
It
seemed
,
however
,
even
in
the
very
face
of
open
*NL*
day
,
that
at
least
a
year
had
elapsed
since
all
these
things
had
passed
,
*NL*
so
deep
was
the
impression
made
in
his
mind
by
the
dream
,
and
so
strong
*NL*
a
hold
had
it
taken
of
his
imagination
.
Thus
every
now
and
then
he
*NL*
saw
in
fancy
amid
the
sailors
,
seated
on
a
rock
,
or
undulating
in
the
*NL*
vessel
,
one
of
the
shadows
which
had
shared
his
dream
with
looks
and
*NL*
kisses
.
Otherwise
,
his
head
was
perfectly
clear
,
and
his
body
refreshed
;
*NL*
he
was
free
from
the
slightest
headache
;
on
the
contrary
,
he
felt
a
*NL*
certain
degree
of
lightness
,
a
faculty
for
absorbing
the
pure
air
,
and
*NL*
enjoying
the
bright
sunshine
more
vividly
than
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
gayly
up
to
the
sailors
,
who
rose
as
soon
as
they
perceived
him
;
*NL*
and
the
patron
,
accosting
him
,
said
,
``
The
Signor
Sinbad
has
left
his
*NL*
compliments
for
your
excellency
,
and
desires
us
to
express
the
regret
he
*NL*
feels
at
not
being
able
to
take
his
leave
in
person
;
but
he
trusts
you
*NL*
will
excuse
him
,
as
very
important
business
calls
him
to
Malaga
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
,
then
,
Gaetano
,
''
said
Franz
,
``
this
is
,
then
,
all
reality
;
there
*NL*
exists
a
man
who
has
received
me
in
this
island
,
entertained
me
right
*NL*
royally
,
and
his
departed
while
I
was
asleep
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
exists
as
certainly
as
that
you
may
see
his
small
yacht
with
all
*NL*
her
sails
spread
;
and
if
you
will
use
your
glass
,
you
will
,
in
all
*NL*
probability
,
recognize
your
host
in
the
midst
of
his
crew
.
''
So
saying
,
*NL*
Gaetano
pointed
in
a
direction
in
which
a
small
vessel
was
making
sail
*NL*
towards
the
southern
point
of
Corsica
.
Franz
adjusted
his
telescope
,
and
*NL*
directed
it
towards
the
yacht
.
Gaetano
was
not
mistaken
.
At
the
stern
*NL*
the
mysterious
stranger
was
standing
up
looking
towards
the
shore
,
and
*NL*
holding
a
spy-glass
in
his
hand
.
He
was
attired
as
he
had
been
on
the
*NL*
previous
evening
,
and
waved
his
pocket-handkerchief
to
his
guest
in
*NL*
token
of
adieu
.
Franz
returned
the
salute
by
shaking
his
handkerchief
as
*NL*
an
exchange
of
signals
.
After
a
second
,
a
slight
cloud
of
smoke
was
seen
*NL*
at
the
stern
of
the
vessel
,
which
rose
gracefully
as
it
expanded
in
*NL*
the
air
,
and
then
Franz
heard
a
slight
report
.
``
There
,
do
you
hear
?
''
*NL*
observed
Gaetano
;
``
he
is
bidding
you
adieu
.
''
The
young
man
took
his
*NL*
carbine
and
fired
it
in
the
air
,
but
without
any
idea
that
the
noise
*NL*
could
be
heard
at
the
distance
which
separated
the
yacht
from
the
shore
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
your
excellency
's
orders
?
''
inquired
Gaetano
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
first
place
,
light
me
a
torch
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
yes
,
I
understand
,
''
replied
the
patron
,
``
to
find
the
entrance
to
*NL*
the
enchanted
apartment
.
With
much
pleasure
,
your
excellency
,
if
it
*NL*
would
amuse
you
;
and
I
will
get
you
the
torch
you
ask
for
.
But
I
too
*NL*
have
had
the
idea
you
have
,
and
two
or
three
times
the
same
fancy
has
*NL*
come
over
me
;
but
I
have
always
given
it
up
.
Giovanni
,
light
a
torch
,
''
*NL*
he
added
,
``
and
give
it
to
his
excellency
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Giovanni
obeyed
.
Franz
took
the
lamp
,
and
entered
the
subterranean
*NL*
grotto
,
followed
by
Gaetano
.
He
recognized
the
place
where
he
had
awaked
*NL*
by
the
bed
of
heather
that
was
there
;
but
it
was
in
vain
that
he
carried
*NL*
his
torch
all
round
the
exterior
surface
of
the
grotto
.
He
saw
nothing
,
*NL*
unless
that
,
by
traces
of
smoke
,
others
had
before
him
attempted
the
*NL*
same
thing
,
and
,
like
him
,
in
vain
.
Yet
he
did
not
leave
a
foot
of
this
*NL*
granite
wall
,
as
impenetrable
as
futurity
,
without
strict
scrutiny
;
he
*NL*
did
not
see
a
fissure
without
introducing
the
blade
of
his
hunting
sword
*NL*
into
it
,
or
a
projecting
point
on
which
he
did
not
lean
and
press
in
*NL*
the
hopes
it
would
give
way
.
All
was
vain
;
and
he
lost
two
hours
in
his
*NL*
attempts
,
which
were
at
last
utterly
useless
.
At
the
end
of
this
time
he
*NL*
gave
up
his
search
,
and
Gaetano
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Franz
appeared
again
on
the
shore
,
the
yacht
only
seemed
like
a
*NL*
small
white
speck
on
the
horizon
.
He
looked
again
through
his
glass
,
but
*NL*
even
then
he
could
not
distinguish
anything
.
Gaetano
reminded
him
that
*NL*
he
had
come
for
the
purpose
of
shooting
goats
,
which
he
had
utterly
*NL*
forgotten
.
He
took
his
fowling-piece
,
and
began
to
hunt
over
the
island
*NL*
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
is
fulfilling
a
duty
,
rather
than
enjoying
a
*NL*
pleasure
;
and
at
the
end
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
he
had
killed
a
goat
*NL*
and
two
kids
.
These
animals
,
though
wild
and
agile
as
chamois
,
were
too
*NL*
much
like
domestic
goats
,
and
Franz
could
not
consider
them
as
game
.
*NL*
Moreover
,
other
ideas
,
much
more
enthralling
,
occupied
his
mind
.
Since
,
*NL*
the
evening
before
,
he
had
really
been
the
hero
of
one
of
the
tales
of
*NL*
the
``
Thousand
and
One
Nights
,
''
and
he
was
irresistibly
attracted
towards
*NL*
the
grotto
.
Then
,
in
spite
of
the
failure
of
his
first
search
,
he
began
*NL*
a
second
,
after
having
told
Gaetano
to
roast
one
of
the
two
kids
.
The
*NL*
second
visit
was
a
long
one
,
and
when
he
returned
the
kid
was
roasted
*NL*
and
the
repast
ready
.
Franz
was
sitting
on
the
spot
where
he
was
on
the
*NL*
previous
evening
when
his
mysterious
host
had
invited
him
to
supper
;
and
*NL*
he
saw
the
little
yacht
,
now
like
a
sea-gull
on
the
wave
,
continuing
her
*NL*
flight
towards
Corsica
.
``
Why
,
''
he
remarked
to
Gaetano
,
``
you
told
me
that
*NL*
Signor
Sinbad
was
going
to
Malaga
,
while
it
seems
he
is
in
the
direction
*NL*
of
Porto-Vecchio
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
remember
,
''
said
the
patron
,
``
I
told
you
that
among
the
crew
*NL*
there
were
two
Corsican
brigands
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
True
;
and
he
is
going
to
land
them
,
''
added
Franz
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Precisely
so
,
''
replied
Gaetano
.
``
Ah
,
he
is
one
who
fears
neither
God
*NL*
nor
Satan
,
they
say
,
and
would
at
any
time
run
fifty
leagues
out
of
his
*NL*
course
to
do
a
poor
devil
a
service
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
such
services
as
these
might
involve
him
with
the
authorities
*NL*
of
the
country
in
which
he
practices
this
kind
of
philanthropy
,
''
said
*NL*
Franz
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
cares
he
for
that
,
''
replied
Gaetano
with
a
laugh
,
``
or
any
*NL*
authorities
?
He
smiles
at
them
.
Let
them
try
to
pursue
him
!
Why
,
in
the
*NL*
first
place
,
his
yacht
is
not
a
ship
,
but
a
bird
,
and
he
would
beat
any
*NL*
frigate
three
knots
in
every
nine
;
and
if
he
were
to
throw
himself
on
*NL*
the
coast
,
why
,
is
he
not
certain
of
finding
friends
everywhere
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
perfectly
clear
that
the
Signor
Sinbad
,
Franz
's
host
,
had
the
*NL*
honor
of
being
on
excellent
terms
with
the
smugglers
and
bandits
*NL*
along
the
whole
coast
of
the
Mediterranean
,
and
so
enjoyed
exceptional
*NL*
privileges
.
As
to
Franz
,
he
had
no
longer
any
inducement
to
remain
*NL*
at
Monte
Cristo
.
He
had
lost
all
hope
of
detecting
the
secret
of
the
*NL*
grotto
;
he
consequently
despatched
his
breakfast
,
and
,
his
boat
being
*NL*
ready
,
he
hastened
on
board
,
and
they
were
soon
under
way
.
At
the
*NL*
moment
the
boat
began
her
course
they
lost
sight
of
the
yacht
,
as
it
*NL*
disappeared
in
the
gulf
of
Porto-Vecchio
.
With
it
was
effaced
the
*NL*
last
trace
of
the
preceding
night
;
and
then
supper
,
Sinbad
,
hashish
,
*NL*
statues
,
--
all
became
a
dream
for
Franz
.
The
boat
sailed
on
all
day
and
*NL*
all
night
,
and
next
morning
,
when
the
sun
rose
,
they
had
lost
sight
of
*NL*
Monte
Cristo
.
When
Franz
had
once
again
set
foot
on
shore
,
he
forgot
,
*NL*
for
the
moment
at
least
,
the
events
which
had
just
passed
,
while
he
*NL*
finished
his
affairs
of
pleasure
at
Florence
,
and
then
thought
of
*NL*
nothing
but
how
he
should
rejoin
his
companion
,
who
was
awaiting
him
at
*NL*
Rome
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
set
out
,
and
on
the
Saturday
evening
reached
the
Eternal
City
by
the
*NL*
mail-coach
.
An
apartment
,
as
we
have
said
,
had
been
retained
beforehand
,
*NL*
and
thus
he
had
but
to
go
to
Signor
Pastrini
's
hotel
.
But
this
was
not
*NL*
so
easy
a
matter
,
for
the
streets
were
thronged
with
people
,
and
Rome
*NL*
was
already
a
prey
to
that
low
and
feverish
murmur
which
precedes
*NL*
all
great
events
;
and
at
Rome
there
are
four
great
events
in
every
*NL*
year
,
--
the
Carnival
,
Holy
Week
,
Corpus
Christi
,
and
the
Feast
of
St.
*NL*
Peter
.
All
the
rest
of
the
year
the
city
is
in
that
state
of
dull
*NL*
apathy
,
between
life
and
death
,
which
renders
it
similar
to
a
kind
of
*NL*
station
between
this
world
and
the
next
--
a
sublime
spot
,
a
resting-place
*NL*
full
of
poetry
and
character
,
and
at
which
Franz
had
already
halted
five
*NL*
or
six
times
,
and
at
each
time
found
it
more
marvellous
and
striking
.
At
*NL*
last
he
made
his
way
through
the
mob
,
which
was
continually
increasing
*NL*
and
getting
more
and
more
turbulent
,
and
reached
the
hotel
.
On
his
*NL*
first
inquiry
he
was
told
,
with
the
impertinence
peculiar
to
hired
*NL*
hackney-coachmen
and
inn-keepers
with
their
houses
full
,
that
there
was
*NL*
no
room
for
him
at
the
Hotel
de
Londres
.
Then
he
sent
his
card
to
Signor
*NL*
Pastrini
,
and
asked
for
Albert
de
Morcerf
.
This
plan
succeeded
;
and
*NL*
Signor
Pastrini
himself
ran
to
him
,
excusing
himself
for
having
made
his
*NL*
excellency
wait
,
scolding
the
waiters
,
taking
the
candlestick
from
the
*NL*
porter
,
who
was
ready
to
pounce
on
the
traveller
and
was
about
to
lead
*NL*
him
to
Albert
,
when
Morcerf
himself
appeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
apartment
consisted
of
two
small
rooms
and
a
parlor
.
The
two
rooms
*NL*
looked
onto
the
street
--
a
fact
which
Signor
Pastrini
commented
upon
as
*NL*
an
inappreciable
advantage
.
The
rest
of
the
floor
was
hired
by
a
very
*NL*
rich
gentleman
who
was
supposed
to
be
a
Sicilian
or
Maltese
;
but
the
*NL*
host
was
unable
to
decide
to
which
of
the
two
nations
the
traveller
*NL*
belonged
.
``
Very
good
,
signor
Pastrini
,
''
said
Franz
;
``
but
we
must
have
*NL*
some
supper
instantly
,
and
a
carriage
for
tomorrow
and
the
following
*NL*
days
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
to
supper
,
''
replied
the
landlord
,
``
you
shall
be
served
immediately
;
*NL*
but
as
for
the
carriage
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
as
to
the
carriage
?
''
exclaimed
Albert
.
``
Come
,
come
,
Signor
*NL*
Pastrini
,
no
joking
;
we
must
have
a
carriage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
,
''
replied
the
host
,
``
we
will
do
all
in
our
power
to
procure
you
*NL*
one
--
this
is
all
I
can
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
when
shall
we
know
?
''
inquired
Franz
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To-morrow
morning
,
''
answered
the
inn-keeper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
the
deuce
!
then
we
shall
pay
the
more
,
that
's
all
,
I
see
plainly
*NL*
enough
.
At
Drake
's
or
Aaron
's
one
pays
twenty-five
lire
for
common
days
,
*NL*
and
thirty
or
thirty-five
lire
a
day
more
for
Sundays
and
feast
days
;
*NL*
add
five
lire
a
day
more
for
extras
,
that
will
make
forty
,
and
there
's
*NL*
an
end
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
afraid
if
we
offer
them
double
that
we
shall
not
procure
a
*NL*
carriage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
they
must
put
horses
to
mine
.
It
is
a
little
worse
for
the
*NL*
journey
,
but
that
's
no
matter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
no
horses
.
''
Albert
looked
at
Franz
like
a
man
who
hears
a
*NL*
reply
he
does
not
understand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
understand
that
,
my
dear
Franz
--
no
horses
?
''
he
said
,
``
but
ca
n't
*NL*
we
have
post-horses
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
have
been
all
hired
this
fortnight
,
and
there
are
none
left
but
*NL*
those
absolutely
requisite
for
posting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
we
to
say
to
this
?
''
asked
Franz
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
,
that
when
a
thing
completely
surpasses
my
comprehension
,
I
am
*NL*
accustomed
not
to
dwell
on
that
thing
,
but
to
pass
to
another
.
Is
supper
*NL*
ready
,
Signor
Pastrini
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
your
excellency
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
let
us
sup
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
the
carriage
and
horses
?
''
said
Franz
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
easy
,
my
dear
boy
;
they
will
come
in
due
season
;
it
is
only
a
*NL*
question
of
how
much
shall
be
charged
for
them
.
''
Morcerf
then
,
with
that
*NL*
delighted
philosophy
which
believes
that
nothing
is
impossible
to
a
full
*NL*
purse
or
well-lined
pocketbook
,
supped
,
went
to
bed
,
slept
soundly
,
and
*NL*
dreamed
he
was
racing
all
over
Rome
at
Carnival
time
in
a
coach
with
six
*NL*
horses

The
next
morning
Franz
woke
first
,
and
instantly
rang
the
bell
.
The
*NL*
sound
had
not
yet
died
away
when
Signor
Pastrini
himself
entered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
excellency
,
''
said
the
landlord
triumphantly
,
and
without
waiting
*NL*
for
Franz
to
question
him
,
``
I
feared
yesterday
,
when
I
would
not
promise
*NL*
you
anything

that
you
were
too
late

there
is
not
a
single
carriage
to

that
is

for

last
three

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

returned
Franz
,
``
for

very
three

it
is
most
needed

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is

said
Albert
,
entering
;

no

*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
so
,
''
returned
Franz
,
``
you
have
guessed
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

your
Eternal
City

*NL*
*NL*
``
That

replied
Pastrini
,
who
was
desirous
of
*NL*
keeping
up
the
dignity
of
the
capital
of
the
Christian
world
in
the
*NL*
eyes
of
his
guest
,
``
that
there
are
no
carriages
to
be
had
from
Sunday
*NL*
to
Tuesday
evening

from
now

you
can
have
fifty

you
*NL*
please

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
that
is
something

said
Albert
;
``
to-day

what
may
arrive
between

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ten

twelve
thousand

replied
Franz
,
``
which
*NL*
will
make
it
still
more
difficult

*NL*
*NL*
``
My

Morcerf
,

let

enjoy
the

*NL*
*NL*
``
At

*NL*

exclaimed
Signor
Pastrini
,

``
utterly
impossible

there

only

been

*NL*
The
two
young
men
looked
at

with
an
air

stupefaction

said
Franz
to
Albert

Franz

door
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
An
hour
after
the
vehicle
was
at
the
door
;
it
was
a
hack
conveyance
*NL*
which
was
elevated
to
the
rank
of
a
private
carriage
in
honor
of
the
*NL*
occasion
,
but
,
in
spite
of
its
humble
exterior
,
the
young
men
would
have
*NL*
thought
themselves
happy
to
have
secured
it
for
the
last
three
days
of
*NL*
the
Carnival
.
``
Excellency
,
''
cried
the
cicerone
,
seeing
Franz
approach
*NL*
the
window
,
``
shall
I
bring
the
carriage
nearer
to
the
palace
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Accustomed
as
Franz
was
to
the
Italian
phraseology
,
his
first
impulse
*NL*
was
to
look
round
him
,
but
these
words
were
addressed
to
him
.
Franz
*NL*
was
the
``
excellency
,
''
the
vehicle
was
the
``
carriage
,
''
and
the
Hotel
de
*NL*
Londres
was
the
``
palace
.
''
The
genius
for
laudation
characteristic
of
the
*NL*
race
was
in
that
phrase
.
*NL*
*NL*
Franz
and
Albert
descended
,
the
carriage
approached
the
palace
;
their
*NL*
excellencies
stretched
their
legs
along
the
seats
;
the
cicerone
sprang
*NL*
into
the
seat
behind
.
``
Where
do
your
excellencies
wish
to
go
?
''
asked
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
Saint
Peter
's
first
,
and
then
to
the
Colosseum
,
''
returned
Albert
.
*NL*
But
Albert
did
not
know
that
it
takes
a
day
to
see
Saint
Peter
's
,
and
a
*NL*
month
to
study
it
.
The
day
was
passed
at
Saint
Peter
's
alone
.
Suddenly
*NL*
the
daylight
began
to
fade
away
;
Franz
took
out
his
watch
--
it
was
*NL*
half-past
four
.
They
returned
to
the
hotel
;
at
the
door
Franz
ordered
*NL*
the
coachman
to
be
ready
at
eight
.
He
wished
to
show
Albert
the
*NL*
Colosseum
by
moonlight
,
as
he
had
shown
him
Saint
Peter
's
by
daylight
.
*NL*
When
we
show
a
friend
a
city
one
has
already
visited
,
we
feel
the
same
*NL*
pride
as
when
we
point
out
a
woman
whose
lover
we
have
been
.
He
was
*NL*
to
leave
the
city
by
the
Porta
del
Popolo
,
skirt
the
outer
wall
,
and
*NL*
re-enter
by
the
Porta
San
Giovanni
;
thus
they
would
behold
the
Colosseum
*NL*
without
finding
their
impressions
dulled
by
first
looking
on
the
*NL*
Capitol
,
the
Forum
,
the
Arch
of
Septimus
Severus
,
the
Temple
of
*NL*
Antoninus
and
Faustina
,
and
the
Via
Sacra
.
They
sat
down
to
dinner
.
*NL*
Signor
Pastrini
had
promised
them
a
banquet
;
he
gave
them
a
tolerable
*NL*
repast
.
At
the
end
of
the
dinner
he
entered
in
person
.
Franz
thought
*NL*
that
he
came
to
hear
his
dinner
praised
,
and
began
accordingly
,
but
at
*NL*
the
first
words
he
was
interrupted
.
``
Excellency
,
''
said
Pastrini
,
``
I
am
*NL*
delighted
to
have
your
approbation
,
but
it
was
not
for
that
I
came
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
come
to
tell
us
you
have
procured
a
carriage
?
''
asked
Albert
,
*NL*
lighting
his
cigar
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
and
your
excellencies
will
do
well
not
to
think
of
that
any
longer
;
*NL*
at
Rome
things
can
or
can
not
be
done
;
when
you
are
told
anything
can
not
*NL*
be
done
,
there
is
an
end
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
much
more
convenient
at
Paris
,
--
when
anything
can
not
be
done
,
you
*NL*
pay
double
,
and
it
is
done
directly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
what
all
the
French
say
,
''
returned
Signor
Pastrini
,
somewhat
*NL*
piqued
;
``
for
that
reason
,
I
do
not
understand
why
they
travel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
''
said
Albert
,
emitting
a
volume
of
smoke
and
balancing
his
chair
*NL*
on
its
hind
legs
,
``
only
madmen
,
or
blockheads
like
us
,
ever
do
travel
.
*NL*
Men
in
their
senses
do
not
quit
their
hotel
in
the
Rue
du
Helder
,
their
*NL*
walk
on
the
Boulevard
de
Gand
,
and
the
Cafe
de
Paris
.
''
It
is
of
course
*NL*
understood
that
Albert
resided
in
the
aforesaid
street
,
appeared
every
*NL*
day
on
the
fashionable
walk
,
and
dined
frequently
at
the
only
restaurant
*NL*
where
you
can
really
dine
,
that
is
,
if
you
are
on
good
terms
with
*NL*
its
frequenters
.
Signor
Pastrini
remained
silent
a
short
time
;
it
was
*NL*
evident
that
he
was
musing
over
this
answer
,
which
did
not
seem
*NL*
very
clear
.
``
But
,
''
said
Franz
,
in
his
turn
interrupting
his
host
's
*NL*
meditations
,
``
you
had
some
motive
for
coming
here
,
may
I
beg
to
know
*NL*
what
it
was
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
yes
;
you
have
ordered
your
carriage
at
eight
o'clock
precisely
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
intend
visiting
Il
Colosseo
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
mean
the
Colosseum

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
the

Popolo

drive
round

*NL*
*NL*
``
These

*NL*
``
Well

is
impossible

*NL*
*NL*
``
Impossible

*NL*
*NL*
``
Dangerous

and
why

*NL*
*NL*
``
On
account

the
famous
Luigi
Vampa

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pray
,
who
may
this
famous
Luigi
Vampa
be
?
''
inquired
Albert
;
``
he
may
be
*NL*
very
famous
at
Rome

I
can
assure
you

is
quite
unknown

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
Never

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

then

he

compared
to

the
Decesaris

Gasparones

children

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
then

cried
Franz
,
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
forewarn
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
Once

Signor
Pastrini
turned
toward
Franz
,
who
seemed
to
him
*NL*
the
more
reasonable
of
the
two
;
we
must
do
him
justice
,
--
he
had
had
a
*NL*
great
many
Frenchmen
in
his
house
,
but
had
never
been
able
to
comprehend
*NL*
them

``
Excellency

said
he
gravely
,
addressing
Franz
,
``
if
you
look
*NL*
upon
me
as
a
liar

it
is
useless
for

for
your

--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Albert
does
not
say
you
are
a

said
Franz

``

that
he

not

*NL*
``
But

Franz

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

asked
Franz

*NL*

returned
Signor

hurt
at
Albert

repeated
doubts

of
the
truth
of
his
assertions
,
``
I
do
not
say
this
to
you

but
to
your
*NL*
companion
,
who
knows
Rome
,
and
knows
,
too
,
that
these
things
are
not
to
*NL*
be
laughed
at
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
fellow
,
''
said
Albert
,
turning
to
Franz
,
``
here
is
an
admirable
*NL*
adventure
;
we
will
fill
our
carriage
with
pistols
,
blunderbusses
,
and
*NL*
double-barrelled
guns
.
Luigi
Vampa
comes
to
take
us
,
and
we
take
him
--
we
*NL*
bring
him
back
to
Rome
,
and
present
him
to
his
holiness
the
Pope
,
who
*NL*
asks
how
he
can
repay
so
great
a
service
;
then
we
merely
ask
for
a
*NL*
carriage
and
a
pair
of
horses
,
and
we
see
the
Carnival
in
the
carriage
,
*NL*
and
doubtless
the
Roman
people
will
crown
us
at
the
Capitol
,
and
*NL*
proclaim
us
,
like
Curtius
and
the
veiled
Horatius
,
the
preservers
of
*NL*
their
country
.
''
Whilst
Albert
proposed
this
scheme
,
Signor
Pastrini
's
*NL*
face
assumed
an
expression
impossible
to
describe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
pray
,
''
asked
Franz
,
``
where
are
these
pistols
,
blunderbusses

*NL*
other
deadly
weapons
with
which
you
intend
filling
the
carriage
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
out
of
my
armory

for
at
Terracina
I
was
plundered
even
of
my
*NL*
hunting-knife

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shared
the

fate
at
Aquapendente

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know

Signor
Pastrini

said
Albert
,
lighting
a
second
cigar
at
*NL*
the
first
,
``
that
this
practice
is
very
convenient
for
bandits

that
*NL*
it
seems
to
be
due
to
an
arrangement
of
their
own
.
''
Doubtless
Signor
*NL*
Pastrini
found
this
pleasantry
compromising
,
for
he
only
answered
half
*NL*
the
question
,
and
then
he
spoke
to
Franz
,
as
the
only
one
likely
to
*NL*
listen
with
attention
.
``
Your
excellency
knows
that
it
is
not
customary
*NL*
to
defend
yourself
when
attacked
by
bandits
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
''
cried
Albert
,
whose
courage
revolted
at
the
idea
of
being
*NL*
plundered
tamely
,
``
not
make
any
resistance
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

for
it
would
be
useless

What
could
you
do
against

spring
out

some
pit

ruin
,
or
aqueduct

level
their
pieces
at

you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
,
parbleu
!
--
they
should
kill
me

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
inn-keeper
turned
to
Franz
with
an
air
that
seemed
to
say
,
``
Your
*NL*
friend
is
decidedly
mad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Albert

returned
Franz
,
``
your
answer

sublime

worthy

of
Corneille

only

when
Horace
made
that
answer

the
*NL*
safety
of
Rome
was
concerned
;
but

as
for

it
is
only
to
gratify

a
whim

it
would
be
ridiculous

risk
our
lives

so
foolish
a

Albert
poured
himself
out
a
glass
of
lacryma
Christi
,
which
he
*NL*
sipped
at
intervals
,
muttering
some
unintelligible
words

*NL*
*NL*
``

Franz

fortunately

*NL*
``
Let

Signor

drew
from
his
fob
a
magnificent
Breguet

bearing
the

name
of
its
maker

of
Parisian
manufacture

he
took
his
watch
from

The
host
sat
down

after
having
made
each

a
respectful

which
meant
that

continued
Franz
,
smiling
at
his
friend
's
*NL*
susceptibility
.
``
To
what
class
of
society
does
he
belong
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
was
a
shepherd-boy
attached
to
the
farm
of
the
Count
of
San-Felice
,
*NL*
situated
between
Palestrina
and
the
lake
of
Gabri
;
he
was
born
at
*NL*
Pampinara
,
and
entered
the
count
's
service
when
he
was
five
years
old
;
*NL*
his
father
was
also
a
shepherd
,
who
owned
a
small
flock
,
and
lived
by
*NL*
the
wool
and
the
milk
,
which
he
sold
at
Rome
.
When
quite
a
child
,
the
*NL*
little
Vampa
displayed
a
most
extraordinary
precocity
.
One
day
,
when
he
*NL*
was
seven
years
old
,
he
came
to
the
curate
of
Palestrina
,
and
asked
to
*NL*
be
taught
to
read
;
it
was
somewhat
difficult
,
for
he
could
not
quit
his
*NL*
flock
;
but
the
good
curate
went
every
day
to
say
mass
at
a
little
hamlet
*NL*
too
poor
to
pay
a
priest
and
which
,
having
no
other
name
,
was
called
*NL*
Borgo
;
he
told
Luigi
that
he
might
meet
him
on
his
return
,
and
that
then
*NL*
he
would
give
him
a
lesson
,
warning
him
that
it
would
be
short
,
and
that
*NL*
he
must
profit
as
much
as
possible
by
it
.
The
child
accepted
joyfully
.
*NL*
Every
day
Luigi
led
his
flock
to
graze
on
the
road
that
leads
from
*NL*
Palestrina
to
Borgo
;
every
day
,
at
nine
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
the
*NL*
priest
and
the
boy
sat
down
on
a
bank
by
the
wayside
,
and
the
little
*NL*
shepherd
took
his
lesson
out
of
the
priest
's
breviary
.
At
the
end
of
*NL*
three
months
he
had
learned
to
read
.
This
was
not
enough
--
he
must
now
*NL*
learn
to
write
.
The
priest
had
a
writing
teacher
at
Rome
make
three
*NL*
alphabets
--
one
large
,
one
middling
,
and
one
small
;
and
pointed
out
to
*NL*
him
that
by
the
help
of
a
sharp
instrument
he
could
trace
the
letters
on
*NL*
a
slate
,
and
thus
learn
to
write
.
The
same
evening
,
when
the
flock
was
*NL*
safe
at
the
farm
,
the
little
Luigi
hastened
to
the
smith
at
Palestrina
,
*NL*
took
a
large
nail
,
heated
and
sharpened
it
,
and
formed
a
sort
of
stylus
.
*NL*
The
next
morning
he
gathered
an
armful
of
pieces
of
slate
and
began
.
At
*NL*
the
end
of
three
months
he
had
learned
to
write
.
The
curate
,
astonished
*NL*
at
his
quickness
and
intelligence
,
made
him
a
present
of
pens
,
paper
,
*NL*
and
a
penknife
.
This
demanded
new
effort
,
but
nothing
compared
to
the
*NL*
first
;
at
the
end
of
a
week
he
wrote
as
well
with
this
pen
as
with
the
*NL*
stylus
.
The
curate
related
the
incident
to
the
Count
of
San-Felice
,
*NL*
who
sent
for
the
little
shepherd
,
made
him
read
and
write
before
him
,
*NL*
ordered
his
attendant
to
let
him
eat
with
the
domestics
,
and
to
give
him
*NL*
two
piastres
a
month
.
With
this
,
Luigi
purchased
books
and
pencils
.
*NL*
He
applied
his
imitative
powers
to
everything
,
and
,
like
Giotto
,
when
*NL*
young
,
he
drew
on
his
slate
sheep
,
houses
,
and
trees
.
Then
,
with
his
*NL*
knife
,
he
began
to
carve
all
sorts
of
objects
in
wood
;
it
was
thus
that
*NL*
Pinelli
,
the
famous
sculptor
,
had
commenced
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
girl
of
six
or
seven
--
that
is
,
a
little
younger
than
Vampa
--
tended
*NL*
sheep
on
a
farm
near
Palestrina
;
she
was
an
orphan
,
born
at
Valmontone
*NL*
and
was
named
Teresa
.
The
two
children
met
,
sat
down
near
each
other
,
*NL*
let
their
flocks
mingle
together
,
played
,
laughed
,
and
conversed
*NL*
together
;
in
the
evening
they
separated
the
Count
of
San-Felice
's
*NL*
flock
from
those
of
Baron
Cervetri
,
and
the
children
returned
to
their
*NL*
respective
farms
,
promising
to
meet
the
next
morning
.
The
next
day
they
*NL*
kept
their
word
,
and
thus
they
grew
up
together
.
Vampa
was
twelve
,
and
*NL*
Teresa
eleven
.
And
yet
their
natural
disposition
revealed
itself
.
Beside
*NL*
his
taste
for
the
fine
arts
,
which
Luigi
had
carried
as
far
as
he
*NL*
could
in
his
solitude
,
he
was
given
to
alternating
fits
of
sadness
and
*NL*
enthusiasm
,
was
often
angry
and
capricious
,
and
always
sarcastic
.
None
*NL*
of
the
lads
of
Pampinara
,
Palestrina
,
or
Valmontone
had
been
able
*NL*
to
gain
any
influence
over
him
or
even
to
become
his
companion
.
His
*NL*
disposition
-LRB-
always
inclined
to
exact
concessions
rather
than
to
make
*NL*
them
-RRB-
kept
him
aloof
from
all
friendships
.
Teresa
alone
ruled
by
a
look
,
*NL*
a
word
,
a
gesture
,
this
impetuous
character
,
which
yielded
beneath
the
*NL*
hand
of
a
woman
,
and
which
beneath
the
hand
of
a
man
might
have
broken
,
*NL*
but
could
never
have
been
bended
.
Teresa
was
lively
and
gay
,
but
*NL*
coquettish
to
excess
.
The
two
piastres
that
Luigi
received
every
month
*NL*
from
the
Count
of
San-Felice
's
steward
,
and
the
price
of
all
the
little
*NL*
carvings
in
wood
he
sold
at
Rome
,
were
expended
in
ear-rings
,
necklaces
,
*NL*
and
gold
hairpins
.
So
that
,
thanks
to
her
friend
's
generosity
,
Teresa
*NL*
was
the
most
beautiful
and
the
best-attired
peasant
near
Rome
.
The
two
*NL*
children
grew
up
together
,
passing
all
their
time
with
each
other
,
and
*NL*
giving
themselves
up
to
the
wild
ideas
of
their
different
characters
.
*NL*
Thus
,
in
all
their
dreams
,
their
wishes
,
and
their
conversations
,
Vampa
*NL*
saw
himself
the
captain
of
a
vessel
,
general
of
an
army
,
or
governor
of
*NL*
a
province
.
Teresa
saw
herself
rich
,
superbly
attired
,
and
attended
by
a
*NL*
train
of
liveried
domestics
.
Then
,
when
they
had
thus
passed
the
day
in
*NL*
building
castles
in
the
air
,
they
separated
their
flocks
,
and
descended
*NL*
from
the
elevation
of
their
dreams
to
the
reality
of
their
humble
*NL*
position
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
day
the
young
shepherd
told
the
count
's
steward
that
he
had
seen
a
*NL*
wolf
come
out
of
the
Sabine
mountains
,
and
prowl
around
his
flock
.
The
*NL*
steward
gave
him
a
gun
;
this
was
what
Vampa
longed
for
.
This
gun
had
*NL*
an
excellent
barrel
,
made
at
Breschia
,
and
carrying
a
ball
with
the
*NL*
precision
of
an
English
rifle
;
but
one
day
the
count
broke
the
stock
,
*NL*
and
had
then
cast
the
gun
aside
.
This
,
however
,
was
nothing
to
a
*NL*
sculptor
like
Vampa
;
he
examined
the
broken
stock
,
calculated
what
*NL*
change
it
would
require
to
adapt
the
gun
to
his
shoulder
,
and
made
a
*NL*
fresh
stock
,
so
beautifully
carved
that
it
would
have
fetched
fifteen
or
*NL*
twenty
piastres
,
had
he
chosen
to
sell
it
.
But
nothing
could
be
farther
*NL*
from
his
thoughts
.
For
a
long
time
a
gun
had
been
the
young
man
's
*NL*
greatest
ambition
.
In
every
country
where
independence
has
taken
the
*NL*
place
of
liberty
,
the
first
desire
of
a
manly
heart
is
to
possess
a
*NL*
weapon
,
which
at
once
renders
him
capable
of
defence
or
attack
,
and
,
by
*NL*
rendering
its
owner
terrible
,
often
makes
him
feared
.
From
this
moment
*NL*
Vampa
devoted
all
his
leisure
time
to
perfecting
himself
in
the
use
of
*NL*
his
precious
weapon
;
he
purchased
powder
and
ball
,
and
everything
served
*NL*
him
for
a
mark
--
the
trunk
of
some
old
and
moss-grown
olivetree
,
that
*NL*
grew
on
the
Sabine
mountains
;
the
fox
,
as
he
quitted
his
earth
on
some
*NL*
marauding
excursion
;
the
eagle
that
soared
above
their
heads
:
and
thus
*NL*
he
soon
became
so
expert
,
that
Teresa
overcame
the
terror
she
at
first
*NL*
felt
at
the
report
,
and
amused
herself
by
watching
him
direct
the
ball
*NL*
wherever
he
pleased
,
with
as
much
accuracy
as
if
he
placed
it
by
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
evening
a
wolf
emerged
from
a
pine-wood
near
which
they
were
*NL*
usually
stationed
,
but
the
wolf
had
scarcely
advanced
ten
yards
ere
*NL*
he
was
dead
.
Proud
of
this
exploit
,
Vampa
took
the
dead
animal
on
his
*NL*
shoulders
,
and
carried
him
to
the
farm
.
These
exploits
had
gained
Luigi
*NL*
considerable
reputation
.
The
man
of
superior
abilities
always
finds
*NL*
admirers
,
go
where
he
will
.
He
was
spoken
of
as
the
most
adroit
,
the
*NL*
strongest
,
and
the
most
courageous
contadino
for
ten
leagues
around
;
and
*NL*
although
Teresa
was
universally
allowed
to
be
the
most
beautiful
girl
of
*NL*
the
Sabines
,
no
one
had
ever
spoken
to
her
of
love
,
because
it
was
known
*NL*
that
she
was
beloved
by
Vampa
.
And
yet
the
two
young
people
had
never
*NL*
declared
their
affection
;
they
had
grown
together
like
two
trees
whose
*NL*
roots
are
mingled
,
whose
branches
intertwined
,
and
whose
intermingled
*NL*
perfume
rises
to
the
heavens
.
Only
their
wish
to
see
each
other
had
*NL*
become
a
necessity
,
and
they
would
have
preferred
death
to
a
day
's
*NL*
separation
.
Teresa
was
sixteen
,
and
Vampa
seventeen
.
About
this
time
,
*NL*
a
band
of
brigands
that
had
established
itself
in
the
Lepini
mountains
*NL*
began
to
be
much
spoken
of
.
The
brigands
have
never
been
really
*NL*
extirpated
from
the
neighborhood
of
Rome
.
Sometimes
a
chief
is
wanted
,
*NL*
but
when
a
chief
presents
himself
he
rarely
has
to
wait
long
for
a
band
*NL*
of
followers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
celebrated
Cucumetto
,
pursued
in
the
Abruzzo
,
driven
out
of
the
*NL*
kingdom
of
Naples
,
where
he
had
carried
on
a
regular
war
,
had
crossed
*NL*
the
Garigliano
,
like
Manfred
,
and
had
taken
refuge
on
the
banks
of
the
*NL*
Amasine
between
Sonnino
and
Juperno
.
He
strove
to
collect
a
band
of
*NL*
followers
,
and
followed
the
footsteps
of
Decesaris
and
Gasperone
,
*NL*
whom
he
hoped
to
surpass
.
Many
young
men
of
Palestrina
,
Frascati
,
and
*NL*
Pampinara
had
disappeared
.
Their
disappearance
at
first
caused
much
*NL*
disquietude
;
but
it
was
soon
known
that
they
had
joined
Cucumetto
.
After
*NL*
some
time
Cucumetto
became
the
object
of
universal
attention
;
the
most
*NL*
extraordinary
traits
of
ferocious
daring
and
brutality
were
related
of
*NL*
him
.
One
day
he
carried
off
a
young
girl
,
the
daughter
of
a
surveyor
of
*NL*
Frosinone
.
The
bandit
's
laws
are
positive
;
a
young
girl
belongs
first
*NL*
to
him
who
carries
her
off
,
then
the
rest
draw
lots
for
her
,
and
she
is
*NL*
abandoned
to
their
brutality
until
death
relieves
her
sufferings
.
When
*NL*
their
parents
are
sufficiently
rich
to
pay
a
ransom
,
a
messenger
is
sent
*NL*
to
negotiate
;
the
prisoner
is
hostage
for
the
security
of
the
messenger
;
*NL*
should
the
ransom
be
refused
,
the
prisoner
is
irrevocably
lost
.
The
*NL*
young
girl
's
lover
was
in
Cucumetto
's
troop
;
his
name
was
Carlini
.
When
*NL*
she
recognized
her
lover
,
the
poor
girl
extended
her
arms
to
him
,
and
*NL*
believed
herself
safe
;
but
Carlini
felt
his
heart
sink
,
for
he
but
too
*NL*
well
knew
the
fate
that
awaited
her
.
However
,
as
he
was
a
favorite
with
*NL*
Cucumetto
,
as
he
had
for
three
years
faithfully
served
him
,
and
as
he
*NL*
had
saved
his
life
by
shooting
a
dragoon
who
was
about
to
cut
him
down
,
*NL*
he
hoped
the
chief
would
have
pity
on
him
.
He
took
Cucumetto
one
side
,
*NL*
while
the
young
girl
,
seated
at
the
foot
of
a
huge
pine
that
stood
in
*NL*
the
centre
of
the
forest
,
made
a
veil
of
her
picturesque
head-dress
to
*NL*
hide
her
face
from
the
lascivious
gaze
of
the
bandits
.
There
he
told
*NL*
the
chief
all
--
his
affection
for
the
prisoner
,
their
promises
of
mutual
*NL*
fidelity
,
and
how
every
night
,
since
he
had
been
near
,
they
had
met
in
*NL*
some
neighboring
ruins
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
so
happened
that
night
that
Cucumetto
had
sent
Carlini
to
a
village
,
*NL*
so
that
he
had
been
unable
to
go
to
the
place
of
meeting
.
Cucumetto
had
*NL*
been
there
,
however
,
by
accident
,
as
he
said
,
and
had
carried
the
maiden
*NL*
off
.
Carlini
besought
his
chief
to
make
an
exception
in
Rita
's
favor
,
as
*NL*
her
father
was
rich
,
and
could
pay
a
large
ransom
.
Cucumetto
seemed
to
*NL*
yield
to
his
friend
's
entreaties
,
and
bade
him
find
a
shepherd
to
send
*NL*
to
Rita
's
father
at
Frosinone
.
Carlini
flew
joyfully
to
Rita
,
telling
*NL*
her
she
was
saved
,
and
bidding
her
write
to
her
father
,
to
inform
*NL*
him
what
had
occurred
,
and
that
her
ransom
was
fixed
at
three
hundred
*NL*
piastres
.
Twelve
hours
'
delay
was
all
that
was
granted
--
that
is
,
until
*NL*
nine
the
next
morning
.
The
instant
the
letter
was
written
,
Carlini
*NL*
seized
it
,
and
hastened
to
the
plain
to
find
a
messenger
.
He
found
a
*NL*
young
shepherd
watching
his
flock
.
The
natural
messengers
of
the
bandits
*NL*
are
the
shepherds
who
live
between
the
city
and
the
mountains
,
between
*NL*
civilized
and
savage
life
.
The
boy
undertook
the
commission
,
promising
*NL*
to
be
in
Frosinone
in
less
than
an
hour
.
Carlini
returned
,
anxious
to
*NL*
see
his
mistress
,
and
announce
the
joyful
intelligence
.
He
found
the
*NL*
troop
in
the
glade
,
supping
off
the
provisions
exacted
as
contributions
*NL*
from
the
peasants
;
but
his
eye
vainly
sought
Rita
and
Cucumetto
among
*NL*
them
.
He
inquired
where
they
were
,
and
was
answered
by
a
burst
of
*NL*
laughter
.
A
cold
perspiration
burst
from
every
pore
,
and
his
hair
stood
*NL*
on
end
.
He
repeated
his
question
.
One
of
the
bandits
rose
,
and
offered
*NL*
him
a
glass
filled
with
Orvietto
,
saying
,
`
To
the
health
of
the
brave
*NL*
Cucumetto
and
the
fair
Rita
.
'
At
this
moment
Carlini
heard
a
woman
's
*NL*
cry
;
he
divined
the
truth
,
seized
the
glass
,
broke
it
across
the
face
of
*NL*
him
who
presented
it
,
and
rushed
towards
the
spot
whence
the
cry
came
.
*NL*
After
a
hundred
yards
he
turned
the
corner
of
the
thicket
;
he
found
Rita
*NL*
senseless
in
the
arms
of
Cucumetto
.
At
the
sight
of
Carlini
,
Cucumetto
*NL*
rose
,
a
pistol
in
each
hand
.
The
two
brigands
looked
at
each
other
for
*NL*
a
moment
--
the
one
with
a
smile
of
lasciviousness
on
his
lips
,
the
other
*NL*
with
the
pallor
of
death
on
his
brow
.
A
terrible
battle
between
the
*NL*
two
men
seemed
imminent
;
but
by
degrees
Carlini
's
features
relaxed
,
*NL*
his
hand
,
which
had
grasped
one
of
the
pistols
in
his
belt
,
fell
to
his
*NL*
side
.
Rita
lay
between
them
.
The
moon
lighted
the
group
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Well
,
'
said
Cucumetto
,
`
have
you
executed
your
commission
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Yes
,
captain
,
'
returned
Carlini
.
`
At
nine
o'clock
to-morrow
Rita
's
*NL*
father
will
be
here
with
the
money
.
'
--
`
It
is
well
;
in
the
meantime
,
we
*NL*
will
have
a
merry
night
;
this
young
girl
is
charming
,
and
does
credit
to
*NL*
your
taste
.
Now
,
as
I
am
not
egotistical
,
we
will
return
to
our
comrades
*NL*
and
draw
lots
for
her
.
'
--
`
You
have
determined
,
then
,
to
abandon
her
to
*NL*
the
common
law
?
'
said
Carlini
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Why
should
an
exception
be
made
in
her
favor
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
''
'
I
thought
that
my
entreaties
'
--
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
What
right
have
you
,
any
more
than
the
rest
,
to
ask
for
an
*NL*
exception
?
'
--
`
It
is
true
.
'
--
`
But
never
mind
,
'
continued
Cucumetto
,
*NL*
laughing
,
`
sooner
or
later
your
turn
will
come
.
'
Carlini
's
teeth
*NL*
clinched
convulsively
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Now
,
then
,
'
said
Cucumetto
,
advancing
towards
the
other
bandits
,
`
are
*NL*
you
coming
?
'
--
'
I
follow
you
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cucumetto
departed
,
without
losing
sight
of
Carlini
,
for
,
doubtless
,
*NL*
he
feared
lest
he
should
strike
him
unawares
;
but
nothing
betrayed
a
*NL*
hostile
design
on
Carlini
's
part
.
He
was
standing
,
his
arms
folded
,
near
*NL*
Rita
,
who
was
still
insensible
.
Cucumetto
fancied
for
a
moment
the
young
*NL*
man
was
about
to
take
her
in
his
arms
and
fly
;
but
this
mattered
little
*NL*
to
him
now
Rita
had
been
his
;
and
as
for
the
money
,
three
hundred
*NL*
piastres
distributed
among
the
band
was
so
small
a
sum
that
he
cared
*NL*
little
about
it
.
He
continued
to
follow
the
path
to
the
glade
;
but
,
to
*NL*
his
great
surprise
,
Carlini
arrived
almost
as
soon
as
himself
.
`
Let
us
*NL*
draw
lots
!
let
us
draw
lots
!
'
cried
all
the
brigands
,
when
they
saw
the
*NL*
chief
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Their
demand
was
fair
,
and
the
chief
inclined
his
head
in
sign
of
*NL*
acquiescence
.
The
eyes
of
all
shone
fiercely
as
they
made
their
demand
,
*NL*
and
the
red
light
of
the
fire
made
them
look
like
demons
.
The
names
of
*NL*
all
,
including
Carlini
,
were
placed
in
a
hat
,
and
the
youngest
of
the
*NL*
band
drew
forth
a
ticket
;
the
ticket
bore
the
name
of
Diovolaccio
.
He
*NL*
was
the
man
who
had
proposed
to
Carlini
the
health
of
their
chief
,
and
*NL*
to
whom
Carlini
replied
by
breaking
the
glass
across
his
face
.
A
large
*NL*
wound
,
extending
from
the
temple
to
the
mouth
,
was
bleeding
profusely
.
*NL*
Diovalaccio
,
seeing
himself
thus
favored
by
fortune
,
burst
into
a
loud
*NL*
laugh
.
`
Captain
,
'
said
he
,
`
just
now
Carlini
would
not
drink
your
health
*NL*
when
I
proposed
it
to
him
;
propose
mine
to
him
,
and
let
us
see
if
he
*NL*
will
be
more
condescending
to
you
than
to
me
.
'
Every
one
expected
an
*NL*
explosion
on
Carlini
's
part
;
but
to
their
great
surprise
,
he
took
a
*NL*
glass
in
one
hand
and
a
flask
in
the
other
,
and
filling
it
,
--
`
Your
*NL*
health
,
Diavolaccio
,
'
said
he
calmly
,
and
he
drank
it
off
,
without
his
*NL*
hand
trembling
in
the
least
.
Then
sitting
down
by
the
fire
,
`
My
*NL*
supper
,
'
said
he
;
`
my
expedition
has
given
me
an
appetite
.
'
--
`
Well
done
,
*NL*
Carlini
!
'
cried
the
brigands
;
`
that
is
acting
like
a
good
fellow
;
'
and
*NL*
they
all
formed
a
circle
round
the
fire
,
while
Diavolaccio
disappeared
.
*NL*
Carlini
ate
and
drank
as
if
nothing
had
happened
.
The
bandits
looked
on
*NL*
with
astonishment
at
this
singular
conduct
until
they
heard
footsteps
.
*NL*
They
turned
round
,
and
saw
Diavolaccio
bearing
the
young
girl
in
his
*NL*
arms
.
Her
head
hung
back
,
and
her
long
hair
swept
the
ground
.
As
they
*NL*
entered
the
circle
,
the
bandits
could
perceive
,
by
the
firelight
,
the
*NL*
unearthly
pallor
of
the
young
girl
and
of
Diavolaccio
.
This
apparition
*NL*
was
so
strange
and
so
solemn
,
that
every
one
rose
,
with
the
exception
*NL*
of
Carlini
,
who
remained
seated
,
and
ate
and
drank
calmly
.
Diavolaccio
*NL*
advanced
amidst
the
most
profound
silence
,
and
laid
Rita
at
the
*NL*
captain
's
feet
.
Then
every
one
could
understand
the
cause
of
the
*NL*
unearthly
pallor
in
the
young
girl
and
the
bandit
.
A
knife
was
plunged
*NL*
up
to
the
hilt
in
Rita
's
left
breast
.
Every
one
looked
at
Carlini
;
*NL*
the
sheath
at
his
belt
was
empty
.
`
Ah
,
ah
,
'
said
the
chief
,
'
I
now
*NL*
understand
why
Carlini
stayed
behind
.
'
All
savage
natures
appreciate
a
*NL*
desperate
deed
.
No
other
of
the
bandits
would
,
perhaps
,
have
done
the
*NL*
same
;
but
they
all
understood
what
Carlini
had
done
.
`
Now
,
then
,
'
cried
*NL*
Carlini
,
rising
in
his
turn
,
and
approaching
the
corpse
,
his
hand
on
the
*NL*
butt
of
one
of
his
pistols
,
`
does
any
one
dispute
the
possession
of
*NL*
this
woman
with
me
?
'
--
`
No
,
'
returned
the
chief
,
`
she
is
thine
.
'
Carlini
*NL*
raised
her
in
his
arms
,
and
carried
her
out
of
the
circle
of
firelight
.
*NL*
Cucumetto
placed
his
sentinels
for
the
night
,
and
the
bandits
wrapped
*NL*
themselves
in
their
cloaks
,
and
lay
down
before
the
fire
.
At
midnight
*NL*
the
sentinel
gave
the
alarm
,
and
in
an
instant
all
were
on
the
alert
.
It
*NL*
was
Rita
's
father
,
who
brought
his
daughter
's
ransom
in
person
.
`
Here
,
'
*NL*
said
he
,
to
Cucumetto
,
`
here
are
three
hundred
piastres
;
give
me
back
*NL*
my
child
.
But
the
chief
,
without
taking
the
money
,
made
a
sign
to
him
*NL*
to
follow
.
The
old
man
obeyed
.
They
both
advanced
beneath
the
trees
,
*NL*
through
whose
branches
streamed
the
moonlight
.
Cucumetto
stopped
at
*NL*
last
,
and
pointed
to
two
persons
grouped
at
the
foot
of
a
tree
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
There
,
'
said
he
,
`
demand
thy
child
of
Carlini
;
he
will
tell
thee
*NL*
what
has
become
of
her
;
'
and
he
returned
to
his
companions
.
The
old
man
*NL*
remained
motionless
;
he
felt
that
some
great
and
unforeseen
misfortune
*NL*
hung
over
his
head
.
At
length
he
advanced
toward
the
group
,
the
meaning
*NL*
of
which
he
could
not
comprehend
.
As
he
approached
,
Carlini
raised
his
*NL*
head
,
and
the
forms
of
two
persons
became
visible
to
the
old
man
's
eyes
.
*NL*
A
woman
lay
on
the
ground
,
her
head
resting
on
the
knees
of
a
man
,
*NL*
who
was
seated
by
her
;
as
he
raised
his
head
,
the
woman
's
face
became
*NL*
visible
.
The
old
man
recognized
his
child
,
and
Carlini
recognized
the
*NL*
old
man
.
'
I
expected
thee
,
'
said
the
bandit
to
Rita
's
father
.
--
`
Wretch
!
'
*NL*
returned
the
old
man
,
`
what
hast
thou
done
?
'
and
he
gazed
with
terror
on
*NL*
Rita
,
pale
and
bloody
,
a
knife
buried
in
her
bosom
.
A
ray
of
*NL*
moonlight
poured
through
the
trees
,
and
lighted
up
the
face
of
the
*NL*
dead
.
--
`
Cucumetto
had
violated
thy
daughter
,
'
said
the
bandit
;
'
I
loved
*NL*
her
,
therefore
I
slew
her
;
for
she
would
have
served
as
the
sport
of
*NL*
the
whole
band
.
'
The
old
man
spoke
not
,
and
grew
pale
as
death
.
`
Now
,
'
*NL*
continued
Carlini
,
`
if
I
have
done
wrongly
,
avenge
her
;
'
and
withdrawing
*NL*
the
knife
from
the
wound
in
Rita
's
bosom
,
he
held
it
out
to
the
old
man
*NL*
with
one
hand
,
while
with
the
other
he
tore
open
his
vest
.
--
`
Thou
hast
*NL*
done
well
!
'
returned
the
old
man
in
a
hoarse
voice
;
'em
brace
me
,
my
*NL*
son
.
'
Carlini
threw
himself
,
sobbing
like
a
child
,
into
the
arms
of
his
*NL*
mistress
's
father
.
These
were
the
first
tears
the
man
of
blood
had
*NL*
ever
wept
.
`
Now
,
'
said
the
old
man
,
`
aid
me
to
bury
my
child
.
'
Carlini
*NL*
fetched
two
pickaxes
;
and
the
father
and
the
lover
began
to
dig
at
the
*NL*
foot
of
a
huge
oak
,
beneath
which
the
young
girl
was
to
repose
.
When
*NL*
the
grave
was
formed
,
the
father
kissed
her
first
,
and
then
the
lover
;
*NL*
afterwards
,
one
taking
the
head
,
the
other
the
feet
,
they
placed
her
*NL*
in
the
grave
.
Then
they
knelt
on
each
side
of
the
grave
,
and
said
the
*NL*
prayers
of
the
dead
.
Then
,
when
they
had
finished
,
they
cast
the
earth
*NL*
over
the
corpse
,
until
the
grave
was
filled
.
Then
,
extending
his
*NL*
hand
,
the
old
man
said
;
'
I
thank
you
,
my
son
;
and
now
leave
me
*NL*
alone
.
'
--
`
Yet
'
--
replied
Carlini
.
--
`
Leave
me
,
I
command
you
.
'
Carlini
*NL*
obeyed
,
rejoined
his
comrades
,
folded
himself
in
his
cloak
,
and
soon
*NL*
appeared
to
sleep
as
soundly
as
the
rest
.
It
had
been
resolved
the
night
*NL*
before
to
change
their
encampment
.
An
hour
before
daybreak
,
Cucumetto
*NL*
aroused
his
men
,
and
gave
the
word
to
march
.
But
Carlini
would
not
quit
*NL*
the
forest
,
without
knowing
what
had
become
of
Rita
's
father
.
He
went
*NL*
toward
the
place
where
he
had
left
him
.
He
found
the
old
man
suspended
*NL*
from
one
of
the
branches
of
the
oak
which
shaded
his
daughter
's
grave
.
*NL*
He
then
took
an
oath
of
bitter
vengeance
over
the
dead
body
of
the
one
*NL*
and
the
tomb
of
the
other
.
But
he
was
unable
to
complete
this
oath
,
for
*NL*
two
days
afterwards
,
in
an
encounter
with
the
Roman
carbineers
,
Carlini
*NL*
was
killed
.
There
was
some
surprise
,
however
,
that
,
as
he
was
with
his
*NL*
face
to
the
enemy
,
he
should
have
received
a
ball
between
his
shoulders
.
*NL*
That
astonishment
ceased
when
one
of
the
brigands
remarked
to
his
*NL*
comrades
that
Cucumetto
was
stationed
ten
paces
in
Carlini
's
rear
when
*NL*
he
fell
.
On
the
morning
of
the
departure
from
the
forest
of
Frosinone
he
*NL*
had
followed
Carlini
in
the
darkness
,
and
heard
this
oath
of
vengeance
,
*NL*
and
,
like
a
wise
man
,
anticipated
it
.
They
told
ten
other
stories
of
*NL*
this
bandit
chief
,
each
more
singular
than
the
other
.
Thus
,
from
Fondi
*NL*
to
Perusia
,
every
one
trembles
at
the
name
of
Cucumetto
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
These
narratives
were
frequently
the
theme
of
conversation
between
*NL*
Luigi
and
Teresa
.
The
young
girl
trembled
very
much
at
hearing
the
*NL*
stories
;
but
Vampa
reassured
her
with
a
smile
,
tapping
the
butt
of
his
*NL*
good
fowling-piece
,
which
threw
its
ball
so
well
;
and
if
that
did
not
*NL*
restore
her
courage
,
he
pointed
to
a
crow
,
perched
on
some
dead
branch
,
*NL*
took
aim
,
touched
the
trigger
,
and
the
bird
fell
dead
at
the
foot
of
the
*NL*
tree
.
Time
passed
on
,
and
the
two
young
people
had
agreed
to
be
married
*NL*
when
Vampa
should
be
twenty
and
Teresa
nineteen
years
of
age
.
They
were
*NL*
both
orphans
,
and
had
only
their
employers
'
leave
to
ask
,
which
had
been
*NL*
already
sought
and
obtained
.
One
day
when
they
were
talking
over
their
*NL*
plans
for
the
future
,
they
heard
two
or
three
reports
of
firearms
,
*NL*
and
then
suddenly
a
man
came
out
of
the
wood
,
near
which
the
two
young
*NL*
persons
used
to
graze
their
flocks
,
and
hurried
towards
them
.
When
he
*NL*
came
within
hearing
,
he
exclaimed
.
'
I
am
pursued
;
can
you
conceal
me
?
'
*NL*
They
knew
full
well
that
this
fugitive
must
be
a
bandit
;
but
there
is
an
*NL*
innate
sympathy
between
the
Roman
brigand
and
the
Roman
peasant
and
the
*NL*
latter
is
always
ready
to
aid
the
former
.
Vampa
,
without
saying
a
word
,
*NL*
hastened
to
the
stone
that
closed
up
the
entrance
to
their
grotto
,
drew
*NL*
it
away
,
made
a
sign
to
the
fugitive
to
take
refuge
there
,
in
a
retreat
*NL*
unknown
to
every
one
,
closed
the
stone
upon
him
,
and
then
went
and
*NL*
resumed
his
seat
by
Teresa
.
Instantly
afterwards
four
carbineers
,
on
*NL*
horseback
,
appeared
on
the
edge
of
the
wood
;
three
of
them
appeared
to
*NL*
be
looking
for
the
fugitive
,
while
the
fourth
dragged
a
brigand
prisoner
*NL*
by
the
neck
.
The
three
carbineers
looked
about
carefully
on
every
side
,
*NL*
saw
the
young
peasants
,
and
galloping
up
,
began
to
question
them
.
They
*NL*
had
seen
no
one
.
`
That
is
very
annoying
,
'
said
the
brigadier
;
for
the
*NL*
man
we
are
looking
for
is
the
chief
.
'
--
`
Cucumetto
?
'
cried
Luigi
and
*NL*
Teresa
at
the
same
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Yes
,
'
replied
the
brigadier
;
`
and
as
his
head
is
valued
at
a
thousand
*NL*
Roman
crowns
,
there
would
have
been
five
hundred
for
you
,
if
you
had
*NL*
helped
us
to
catch
him
.
'
The
two
young
persons
exchanged
looks
.
The
*NL*
brigadier
had
a
moment
's
hope
.
Five
hundred
Roman
crowns
are
three
*NL*
thousand
lire
,
and
three
thousand
lire
are
a
fortune
for
two
poor
*NL*
orphans
who
are
going
to
be
married
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Yes
,
it
is
very
annoying
,
'
said
Vampa
;
`
but
we
have
not
seen
him
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
the
carbineers
scoured
the
country
in
different
directions
,
but
*NL*
in
vain
;
then
,
after
a
time
,
they
disappeared
.
Vampa
then
removed
the
*NL*
stone
,
and
Cucumetto
came
out
.
Through
the
crevices
in
the
granite
he
*NL*
had
seen
the
two
young
peasants
talking
with
the
carbineers
,
and
guessed
*NL*
the
subject
of
their
parley
.
He
had
read
in
the
countenances
of
Luigi
*NL*
and
Teresa
their
steadfast
resolution
not
to
surrender
him
,
and
he
drew
*NL*
from
his
pocket
a
purse
full
of
gold
,
which
he
offered
to
them
.
But
*NL*
Vampa
raised
his
head
proudly
;
as
to
Teresa
,
her
eyes
sparkled
when
she
*NL*
thought
of
all
the
fine
gowns
and
gay
jewellery
she
could
buy
with
this
*NL*
purse
of
gold
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cucumetto
was
a
cunning
fiend
,
and
had
assumed
the
form
of
a
brigand
*NL*
instead
of
a
serpent
,
and
this
look
from
Teresa
showed
to
him
that
she
*NL*
was
a
worthy
daughter
of
Eve
,
and
he
returned
to
the
forest
,
pausing
*NL*
several
times
on
his
way
,
under
the
pretext
of
saluting
his
protectors
.
*NL*
Several
days
elapsed
,
and
they
neither
saw
nor
heard
of
Cucumetto
.
The
*NL*
time
of
the
Carnival
was
at
hand
.
The
Count
of
San-Felice
announced
a
*NL*
grand
masked
ball
,
to
which
all
that
were
distinguished
in
Rome
were
*NL*
invited
.
Teresa
had
a
great
desire
to
see
this
ball
.
Luigi
asked
*NL*
permission
of
his
protector
,
the
steward
,
that
she
and
he
might
be
*NL*
present
amongst
the
servants
of
the
house
.
This
was
granted
.
The
ball
*NL*
was
given
by
the
Count
for
the
particular
pleasure
of
his
daughter
*NL*
Carmela
,
whom
he
adored
.
Carmela
was
precisely
the
age
and
figure
of
*NL*
Teresa
,
and
Teresa
was
as
handsome
as
Carmela
.
On
the
evening
of
the
*NL*
ball
Teresa
was
attired
in
her
best
,
her
most
brilliant
ornaments
in
her
*NL*
hair
,
and
gayest
glass
beads
,
--
she
was
in
the
costume
of
the
women
of
*NL*
Frascati
.
Luigi
wore
the
very
picturesque
garb
of
the
Roman
peasant
*NL*
at
holiday
time
.
They
both
mingled
,
as
they
had
leave
to
do
,
with
the
*NL*
servants
and
peasants
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
festa
was
magnificent
;
not
only
was
the
villa
brilliantly
*NL*
illuminated
,
but
thousands
of
colored
lanterns
were
suspended
from
*NL*
the
trees
in
the
garden
;
and
very
soon
the
palace
overflowed
to
the
*NL*
terraces
,
and
the
terraces
to
the
garden-walks
.
At
each
cross-path
was
*NL*
an
orchestra
,
and
tables
spread
with
refreshments
;
the
guests
stopped
,
*NL*
formed
quadrilles
,
and
danced
in
any
part
of
the
grounds
they
pleased
.
*NL*
Carmela
was
attired
like
a
woman
of
Sonnino
.
Her
cap
was
embroidered
*NL*
with
pearls
,
the
pins
in
her
hair
were
of
gold
and
diamonds
,
her
girdle
*NL*
was
of
Turkey
silk
,
with
large
embroidered
flowers
,
her
bodice
and
skirt
*NL*
were
of
cashmere
,
her
apron
of
Indian
muslin
,
and
the
buttons
of
her
*NL*
corset
were
of
jewels
.
Two
of
her
companions
were
dressed
,
the
one
as
a
*NL*
woman
of
Nettuno
,
and
the
other
as
a
woman
of
La
Riccia
.
Four
young
men
*NL*
of
the
richest
and
noblest
families
of
Rome
accompanied
them
with
that
*NL*
Italian
freedom
which
has
not
its
parallel
in
any
other
country
in
*NL*
the
world
.
They
were
attired
as
peasants
of
Albano
,
Velletri
,
*NL*
Civita-Castellana
,
and
Sora
.
We
need
hardly
add
that
these
peasant
*NL*
costumes
,
like
those
of
the
young
women
,
were
brilliant
with
gold
and
*NL*
jewels
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Carmela
wished
to
form
a
quadrille
,
but
there
was
one
lady
wanting
.
*NL*
Carmela
looked
all
around
her
,
but
not
one
of
the
guests
had
a
costume
*NL*
similar
to
her
own
,
or
those
of
her
companions
.
The
Count
of
San-Felice
*NL*
pointed
out
Teresa
,
who
was
hanging
on
Luigi
's
arm
in
a
group
of
*NL*
peasants
.
`
Will
you
allow
me
,
father
?
'
said
Carmela
.
--
`
Certainly
,
'
*NL*
replied
the
count
,
`
are
we
not
in
Carnival
time
?
'
--
Carmela
turned
*NL*
towards
the
young
man
who
was
talking
with
her
,
and
saying
a
few
words
*NL*
to
him
,
pointed
with
her
finger
to
Teresa
.
The
young
man
looked
,
bowed
*NL*
in
obedience
,
and
then
went
to
Teresa
,
and
invited
her
to
dance
in
a
*NL*
quadrille
directed
by
the
count
's
daughter
.
Teresa
felt
a
flush
pass
*NL*
over
her
face
;
she
looked
at
Luigi
,
who
could
not
refuse
his
assent
.
*NL*
Luigi
slowly
relinquished
Teresa
's
arm
,
which
he
had
held
beneath
his
*NL*
own
,
and
Teresa
,
accompanied
by
her
elegant
cavalier
,
took
her
appointed
*NL*
place
with
much
agitation
in
the
aristocratic
quadrille
.
Certainly
,
in
*NL*
the
eyes
of
an
artist
,
the
exact
and
strict
costume
of
Teresa
had
a
very
*NL*
different
character
from
that
of
Carmela
and
her
companions
;
and
Teresa
*NL*
was
frivolous
and
coquettish
,
and
thus
the
embroidery
and
muslins
,
the
*NL*
cashmere
waist-girdles
,
all
dazzled
her
,
and
the
reflection
of
sapphires
*NL*
and
diamonds
almost
turned
her
giddy
brain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Luigi
felt
a
sensation
hitherto
unknown
arising
in
his
mind
.
It
was
*NL*
like
an
acute
pain
which
gnawed
at
his
heart
,
and
then
thrilled
through
*NL*
his
whole
body
.
He
followed
with
his
eye
each
movement
of
Teresa
and
her
*NL*
cavalier
;
when
their
hands
touched
,
he
felt
as
though
he
should
swoon
;
*NL*
every
pulse
beat
with
violence
,
and
it
seemed
as
though
a
bell
were
*NL*
ringing
in
his
ears
.
When
they
spoke
,
although
Teresa
listened
timidly
*NL*
and
with
downcast
eyes
to
the
conversation
of
her
cavalier
,
as
Luigi
*NL*
could
read
in
the
ardent
looks
of
the
good-looking
young
man
that
his
*NL*
language
was
that
of
praise
,
it
seemed
as
if
the
whole
world
was
turning
*NL*
round
with
him
,
and
all
the
voices
of
hell
were
whispering
in
his
ears
*NL*
ideas
of
murder
and
assassination
.
Then
fearing
that
his
paroxysm
might
*NL*
get
the
better
of
him
,
he
clutched
with
one
hand
the
branch
of
a
tree
*NL*
against
which
he
was
leaning
,
and
with
the
other
convulsively
grasped
*NL*
the
dagger
with
a
carved
handle
which
was
in
his
belt
,
and
which
,
*NL*
unwittingly
,
he
drew
from
the
scabbard
from
time
to
time
.
Luigi
was
*NL*
jealous
!
He
felt
that
,
influenced
by
her
ambitions
and
coquettish
*NL*
disposition
,
Teresa
might
escape
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
young
peasant
girl
,
at
first
timid
and
scared
,
soon
recovered
*NL*
herself
.
We
have
said
that
Teresa
was
handsome
,
but
this
is
not
all
;
*NL*
Teresa
was
endowed
with
all
those
wild
graces
which
are
so
much
more
*NL*
potent
than
our
affected
and
studied
elegancies
.
She
had
almost
all
*NL*
the
honors
of
the
quadrille
,
and
if
she
were
envious
of
the
Count
of
*NL*
San-Felice
's
daughter
,
we
will
not
undertake
to
say
that
Carmela
was
not
*NL*
jealous
of
her
.
And
with
overpowering
compliments
her
handsome
cavalier
*NL*
led
her
back
to
the
place
whence
he
had
taken
her
,
and
where
Luigi
*NL*
awaited
her
.
Twice
or
thrice
during
the
dance
the
young
girl
had
glanced
*NL*
at
Luigi
,
and
each
time
she
saw
that
he
was
pale
and
that
his
features
*NL*
were
agitated
,
once
even
the
blade
of
his
knife
,
half
drawn
from
its
*NL*
sheath
,
had
dazzled
her
eyes
with
its
sinister
glare
.
Thus
,
it
was
*NL*
almost
tremblingly
that
she
resumed
her
lover
's
arm
.
The
quadrille
had
*NL*
been
most
perfect
,
and
it
was
evident
there
was
a
great
demand
for
a
*NL*
repetition
,
Carmela
alone
objecting
to
it
,
but
the
Count
of
San-Felice
*NL*
besought
his
daughter
so
earnestly
,
that
she
acceded
.
One
of
the
*NL*
cavaliers
then
hastened
to
invite
Teresa
,
without
whom
it
was
impossible
*NL*
for
the
quadrille
to
be
formed
,
but
the
young
girl
had
disappeared
.
The
*NL*
truth
was
,
that
Luigi
had
not
felt
the
strength
to
support
another
such
*NL*
trial
,
and
,
half
by
persuasion
and
half
by
force
,
he
had
removed
Teresa
*NL*
toward
another
part
of
the
garden
.
Teresa
had
yielded
in
spite
of
*NL*
herself
,
but
when
she
looked
at
the
agitated
countenance
of
the
young
*NL*
man
,
she
understood
by
his
silence
and
trembling
voice
that
something
*NL*
strange
was
passing
within
him
.
She
herself
was
not
exempt
from
internal
*NL*
emotion
,
and
without
having
done
anything
wrong
,
yet
fully
comprehended
*NL*
that
Luigi
was
right
in
reproaching
her
.
Why
,
she
did
not
know
,
but
yet
*NL*
she
did
not
the
less
feel
that
these
reproaches
were
merited
.
However
,
*NL*
to
Teresa
's
great
astonishment
,
Luigi
remained
mute
,
and
not
a
word
*NL*
escaped
his
lips
the
rest
of
the
evening
.
When
the
chill
of
the
night
*NL*
had
driven
away
the
guests
from
the
gardens
,
and
the
gates
of
the
villa
*NL*
were
closed
on
them
for
the
festa
in-doors
,
he
took
Teresa
quite
away
,
*NL*
and
as
he
left
her
at
her
home
,
he
said
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Teresa
,
what
were
you
thinking
of
as
you
danced
opposite
the
young
*NL*
Countess
of
San-Felice
?
'
--
'
I
thought
,
'
replied
the
young
girl
,
with
*NL*
all
the
frankness
of
her
nature
,
`
that
I
would
give
half
my
life
for
a
*NL*
costume
such
as
she
wore
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
And
what
said
your
cavalier
to
you
?
'
--
`
He
said
it
only
depended
on
*NL*
myself
to
have
it
,
and
I
had
only
one
word
to
say
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
He
was
right
,
'
said
Luigi
.
`
Do
you
desire
it
as
ardently
as
you
*NL*
say
?
'
--
`
Yes
.
'
--
`
Well
,
then
,
you
shall
have
it
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
young
girl
,
much
astonished
,
raised
her
head
to
look
at
him
,
but
*NL*
his
face
was
so
gloomy
and
terrible
that
her
words
froze
to
her
lips
.
*NL*
As
Luigi
spoke
thus
,
he
left
her
.
Teresa
followed
him
with
her
eyes
into
*NL*
the
darkness
as
long
as
she
could
,
and
when
he
had
quite
disappeared
,
*NL*
she
went
into
the
house
with
a
sigh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
night
a
memorable
event
occurred
,
due
,
no
doubt
,
to
the
imprudence
*NL*
of
some
servant
who
had
neglected
to
extinguish
the
lights
.
The
Villa
*NL*
of
San-Felice
took
fire
in
the
rooms
adjoining
the
very
apartment
of
the
*NL*
lovely
Carmela
.
Awakened
in
the
night
by
the
light
of
the
flames
,
she
*NL*
sprang
out
of
bed
,
wrapped
herself
in
a
dressing-gown
,
and
attempted
*NL*
to
escape
by
the
door
,
but
the
corridor
by
which
she
hoped
to
fly
was
*NL*
already
a
prey
to
the
flames
.
She
then
returned
to
her
room
,
calling
for
*NL*
help
as
loudly
as
she
could
,
when
suddenly
her
window
,
which
was
twenty
*NL*
feet
from
the
ground
,
was
opened
,
a
young
peasant
jumped
into
the
*NL*
chamber
,
seized
her
in
his
arms
,
and
with
superhuman
skill
and
strength
*NL*
conveyed
her
to
the
turf
of
the
grass-plot
,
where
she
fainted
.
When
she
*NL*
recovered
,
her
father
was
by
her
side
.
All
the
servants
surrounded
her
,
*NL*
offering
her
assistance
.
An
entire
wing
of
the
villa
was
burnt
down
;
but
*NL*
what
of
that
,
as
long
as
Carmela
was
safe
and
uninjured
?
Her
preserver
*NL*
was
everywhere
sought
for
,
but
he
did
not
appear
;
he
was
inquired
after
,
*NL*
but
no
one
had
seen
him
.
Carmela
was
greatly
troubled
that
she
had
not
*NL*
recognized
him
.
As
the
count
was
immensely
rich
,
excepting
the
danger
*NL*
Carmela
had
run
,
--
and
the
marvellous
manner
in
which
she
had
escaped
,
*NL*
made
that
appear
to
him
rather
a
favor
of
providence
than
a
real
*NL*
misfortune
,
--
the
loss
occasioned
by
the
conflagration
was
to
him
but
a
*NL*
trifle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
next
day
,
at
the
usual
hour
,
the
two
young
peasants
were
on
the
*NL*
borders
of
the
forest
.
Luigi
arrived
first
.
He
came
toward
Teresa
in
*NL*
high
spirits
,
and
seemed
to
have
completely
forgotten
the
events
of
the
*NL*
previous
evening
.
The
young
girl
was
very
pensive
,
but
seeing
Luigi
so
*NL*
cheerful
,
she
on
her
part
assumed
a
smiling
air
,
which
was
natural
to
*NL*
her
when
she
was
not
excited
or
in
a
passion
.
Luigi
took
her
arm
beneath
*NL*
his
own
,
and
led
her
to
the
door
of
the
grotto
.
Then
he
paused
.
The
*NL*
young
girl
,
perceiving
that
there
was
something
extraordinary
,
looked
*NL*
at
him
steadfastly
.
`
Teresa
,
'
said
Luigi
,
`
yesterday
evening
you
told
*NL*
me
you
would
give
all
the
world
to
have
a
costume
similar
to
that
of
the
*NL*
count
's
daughter
.
'
--
`
Yes
,
'
replied
Teresa
with
astonishment
;
`
but
I
was
*NL*
mad
to
utter
such
a
wish
.
'
--
`
And
I
replied
,
``
Very
well
,
you
shall
have
*NL*
it
.
''
'
--
`
Yes
,
'
replied
the
young
girl
,
whose
astonishment
increased
*NL*
at
every
word
uttered
by
Luigi
,
`
but
of
course
your
reply
was
only
to
*NL*
please
me
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
''
'
I
have
promised
no
more
than
I
have
given
you
,
Teresa
,
'
said
Luigi
*NL*
proudly
.
`
Go
into
the
grotto
and
dress
yourself
.
'
At
these
words
he
*NL*
drew
away
the
stone
,
and
showed
Teresa
the
grotto
,
lighted
up
by
two
*NL*
wax
lights
,
which
burnt
on
each
side
of
a
splendid
mirror
;
on
a
rustic
*NL*
table
,
made
by
Luigi
,
were
spread
out
the
pearl
necklace
and
the
diamond
*NL*
pins
,
and
on
a
chair
at
the
side
was
laid
the
rest
of
the
costume
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Teresa
uttered
a
cry
of
joy
,
and
,
without
inquiring
whence
this
attire
*NL*
came
,
or
even
thanking
Luigi
,
darted
into
the
grotto
,
transformed
into
a
*NL*
dressing-room
.
Luigi
pushed
the
stone
behind
her
,
for
on
the
crest
of
a
*NL*
small
adjacent
hill
which
cut
off
the
view
toward
Palestrina
,
he
saw
a
*NL*
traveller
on
horseback
,
stopping
a
moment
,
as
if
uncertain
of
his
road
,
*NL*
and
thus
presenting
against
the
blue
sky
that
perfect
outline
which
is
*NL*
peculiar
to
distant
objects
in
southern
climes
.
When
he
saw
Luigi
,
*NL*
he
put
his
horse
into
a
gallop
and
advanced
toward
him
.
Luigi
was
not
*NL*
mistaken
.
The
traveller
,
who
was
going
from
Palestrina
to
Tivoli
,
had
*NL*
mistaken
his
way
;
the
young
man
directed
him
;
but
as
at
a
distance
of
*NL*
a
quarter
of
a
mile
the
road
again
divided
into
three
ways
,
and
on
*NL*
reaching
these
the
traveller
might
again
stray
from
his
route
,
he
begged
*NL*
Luigi
to
be
his
guide
.
Luigi
threw
his
cloak
on
the
ground
,
placed
his
*NL*
carbine
on
his
shoulder
,
and
freed
from
his
heavy
covering
,
preceded
*NL*
the
traveller
with
the
rapid
step
of
a
mountaineer
,
which
a
horse
can
*NL*
scarcely
keep
up
with
.
In
ten
minutes
Luigi
and
the
traveller
reached
*NL*
the
cross-roads
.
On
arriving
there
,
with
an
air
as
majestic
as
that
of
*NL*
an
emperor
,
he
stretched
his
hand
towards
that
one
of
the
roads
which
*NL*
the
traveller
was
to
follow
.
--
``
That
is
your
road
,
excellency
,
and
now
*NL*
you
can
not
again
mistake
.
''
--
`
And
here
is
your
recompense
,
'
said
the
*NL*
traveller
,
offering
the
young
herdsman
some
small
pieces
of
money
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Thank
you
,
'
said
Luigi
,
drawing
back
his
hand
;
'
I
render
a
service
,
I
*NL*
do
not
sell
it
.
'
--
`
Well
,
'
replied
the
traveller
,
who
seemed
used
to
this
*NL*
difference
between
the
servility
of
a
man
of
the
cities
and
the
pride
*NL*
of
the
mountaineer
,
`
if
you
refuse
wages
,
you
will
,
perhaps
,
accept
a
*NL*
gift
.
'
--
`
Ah
,
yes
,
that
is
another
thing
.
'
--
`
Then
,
'
said
the
traveller
,
*NL*
`
take
these
two
Venetian
sequins
and
give
them
to
your
bride
,
to
make
*NL*
herself
a
pair
of
earrings
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
And
then
do
you
take
this
poniard
,
'
said
the
young
herdsman
;
`
you
will
*NL*
not
find
one
better
carved
between
Albano
and
Civita-Castellana
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
''
'
I
accept
it
,
'
answered
the
traveller
,
`
but
then
the
obligation
will
*NL*
be
on
my
side
,
for
this
poniard
is
worth
more
than
two
sequins
.
'
--
`
For
a
*NL*
dealer
perhaps
;
but
for
me
,
who
engraved
it
myself
,
it
is
hardly
worth
a
*NL*
piastre
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
What
is
your
name
?
'
inquired
the
traveller
.
--
`
Luigi
Vampa
,
'
replied
*NL*
the
shepherd
,
with
the
same
air
as
he
would
have
replied
,
Alexander
,
*NL*
King
of
Macedon
.
--
`
And
yours
?
'
--
`
I
,
'
said
the
traveller
,
`
am
called
*NL*
Sinbad
the
Sailor
.
'
''
Franz
d'Epinay
started
with
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sinbad
the
Sailor
.
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
replied
the
narrator
;
``
that
was
the
name
which
the
traveller
gave
*NL*
to
Vampa
as
his
own
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
and
what
may
you
have
to
say
against
this
name
?
''
inquired
Albert
;
*NL*
``
it
is
a
very
pretty
name
,
and
the
adventures
of
the
gentleman
of
that
*NL*
name
amused
me
very
much
in
my
youth
,
I
must
confess
.
''
--
Franz
said
no
*NL*
more
.
The
name
of
Sinbad
the
Sailor
,
as
may
well
be
supposed
,
awakened
*NL*
in
him
a
world
of
recollections
,
as
had
the
name
of
the
Count
of
Monte
*NL*
Cristo
on
the
previous
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Proceed
!
''
said
he
to
the
host
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Vampa
put
the
two
sequins
haughtily
into
his
pocket
,
and
slowly
*NL*
returned
by
the
way
he
had
gone
.
As
he
came
within
two
or
three
hundred
*NL*
paces
of
the
grotto
,
he
thought
he
heard
a
cry
.
He
listened
to
know
*NL*
whence
this
sound
could
proceed
.
A
moment
afterwards
he
thought
he
heard
*NL*
his
own
name
pronounced
distinctly
.
The
cry
proceeded
from
the
grotto
.
*NL*
He
bounded
like
a
chamois
,
cocking
his
carbine
as
he
went
,
and
in
a
*NL*
moment
reached
the
summit
of
a
hill
opposite
to
that
on
which
he
had
*NL*
perceived
the
traveller
.
Three
cries
for
help
came
more
distinctly
to
*NL*
his
ear
.
He
cast
his
eyes
around
him
and
saw
a
man
carrying
off
Teresa
,
*NL*
as
Nessus
,
the
centaur
,
carried
Dejanira
.
This
man
,
who
was
hastening
*NL*
towards
the
wood
,
was
already
three-quarters
of
the
way
on
the
road
from
*NL*
the
grotto
to
the
forest
.
Vampa
measured
the
distance
;
the
man
was
at
*NL*
least
two
hundred
paces
in
advance
of
him
,
and
there
was
not
a
chance
*NL*
of
overtaking
him
.
The
young
shepherd
stopped
,
as
if
his
feet
had
*NL*
been
rooted
to
the
ground
;
then
he
put
the
butt
of
his
carbine
to
his
*NL*
shoulder
,
took
aim
at
the
ravisher
,
followed
him
for
a
second
in
his
*NL*
track
,
and
then
fired
.
The
ravisher
stopped
suddenly
,
his
knees
bent
*NL*
under
him
,
and
he
fell
with
Teresa
in
his
arms
.
The
young
girl
rose
*NL*
instantly
,
but
the
man
lay
on
the
earth
struggling
in
the
agonies
of
*NL*
death
.
Vampa
then
rushed
towards
Teresa
;
for
at
ten
paces
from
the
dying
*NL*
man
her
legs
had
failed
her
,
and
she
had
dropped
on
her
knees
,
so
that
*NL*
the
young
man
feared
that
the
ball
that
had
brought
down
his
enemy
,
had
*NL*
also
wounded
his
betrothed
.
Fortunately
,
she
was
unscathed
,
and
it
was
*NL*
fright
alone
that
had
overcome
Teresa
.
When
Luigi
had
assured
himself
*NL*
that
she
was
safe
and
unharmed
,
he
turned
towards
the
wounded
man
.
He
*NL*
had
just
expired
,
with
clinched
hands
,
his
mouth
in
a
spasm
of
agony
,
*NL*
and
his
hair
on
end
in
the
sweat
of
death
.
His
eyes
remained
open
and
*NL*
menacing
.
Vampa
approached
the
corpse
,
and
recognized
Cucumetto
.
From
*NL*
the
day
on
which
the
bandit
had
been
saved
by
the
two
young
peasants
,
he
*NL*
had
been
enamoured
of
Teresa
,
and
had
sworn
she
should
be
his
.
From
that
*NL*
time
he
had
watched
them
,
and
profiting
by
the
moment
when
her
lover
had
*NL*
left
her
alone
,
had
carried
her
off
,
and
believed
he
at
length
had
her
*NL*
in
his
power
,
when
the
ball
,
directed
by
the
unerring
skill
of
the
young
*NL*
herdsman
,
had
pierced
his
heart
.
Vampa
gazed
on
him
for
a
moment
*NL*
without
betraying
the
slightest
emotion
;
while
,
on
the
contrary
,
Teresa
,
*NL*
shuddering
in
every
limb
,
dared
not
approach
the
slain
ruffian
but
*NL*
by
degrees
,
and
threw
a
hesitating
glance
at
the
dead
body
over
the
*NL*
shoulder
of
her
lover
.
Suddenly
Vampa
turned
toward
his
mistress
:
--
`
Ah
,
'
*NL*
said
he
--
`
good
,
good
!
You
are
dressed
;
it
is
now
my
turn
to
dress
*NL*
myself
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
Teresa
was
clothed
from
head
to
foot
in
the
garb
of
the
Count
of
*NL*
San-Felice
's
daughter
.
Vampa
took
Cucumetto
's
body
in
his
arms
and
*NL*
conveyed
it
to
the
grotto
,
while
in
her
turn
Teresa
remained
outside
.
*NL*
If
a
second
traveller
had
passed
,
he
would
have
seen
a
strange
thing
,
--
a
*NL*
shepherdess
watching
her
flock
,
clad
in
a
cashmere
grown
,
with
ear-rings
*NL*
and
necklace
of
pearls
,
diamond
pins
,
and
buttons
of
sapphires
,
*NL*
emeralds
,
and
rubies
.
He
would
,
no
doubt
,
have
believed
that
he
had
*NL*
returned
to
the
times
of
Florian
,
and
would
have
declared
,
on
reaching
*NL*
Paris
,
that
he
had
met
an
Alpine
shepherdess
seated
at
the
foot
of
*NL*
the
Sabine
Hill
.
At
the
end
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
Vampa
quitted
the
*NL*
grotto
;
his
costume
was
no
less
elegant
than
that
of
Teresa
.
He
wore
*NL*
a
vest
of
garnet-colored
velvet
,
with
buttons
of
cut
gold
;
a
silk
*NL*
waistcoat
covered
with
embroidery
;
a
Roman
scarf
tied
round
his
neck
;
a
*NL*
cartridge-box
worked
with
gold
,
and
red
and
green
silk
;
sky-blue
velvet
*NL*
breeches
,
fastened
above
the
knee
with
diamond
buckles
;
garters
of
*NL*
deerskin
,
worked
with
a
thousand
arabesques
,
and
a
hat
whereon
hung
*NL*
ribbons
of
all
colors
;
two
watches
hung
from
his
girdle
,
and
a
splendid
*NL*
poniard
was
in
his
belt
.
Teresa
uttered
a
cry
of
admiration
.
Vampa
in
*NL*
this
attire
resembled
a
painting
by
Leopold
Robert
,
or
Schnetz
.
He
had
*NL*
assumed
the
entire
costume
of
Cucumetto
.
The
young
man
saw
the
effect
*NL*
produced
on
his
betrothed
,
and
a
smile
of
pride
passed
over
his
*NL*
lips
.
--
`
Now
,
'
he
said
to
Teresa
,
`
are
you
ready
to
share
my
*NL*
fortune
,
whatever
it
may
be
?
'
--
`
Oh
,
yes
!
'
exclaimed
the
young
girl
*NL*
enthusiastically
.
--
`
And
follow
me
wherever
I
go
?
'
--
`
To
the
world
's
*NL*
end
.
'
--
`
Then
take
my
arm
,
and
let
us
on
;
we
have
no
time
to
lose
.
'
--
The
*NL*
young
girl
did
so
without
questioning
her
lover
as
to
where
he
was
*NL*
conducting
her
,
for
he
appeared
to
her
at
this
moment
as
handsome
,
*NL*
proud
,
and
powerful
as
a
god
.
They
went
towards
the
forest
,
and
soon
*NL*
entered
it
.
We
need
scarcely
say
that
all
the
paths
of
the
mountain
were
*NL*
known
to
Vampa
;
he
therefore
went
forward
without
a
moment
's
hesitation
,
*NL*
although
there
was
no
beaten
track
,
but
he
knew
his
path
by
looking
at
*NL*
the
trees
and
bushes
,
and
thus
they
kept
on
advancing
for
nearly
an
hour
*NL*
and
a
half
.
At
the
end
of
this
time
they
had
reached
the
thickest
of
the
*NL*
forest
.
A
torrent
,
whose
bed
was
dry
,
led
into
a
deep
gorge
.
Vampa
took
*NL*
this
wild
road
,
which
,
enclosed
between
two
ridges
,
and
shadowed
by
the
*NL*
tufted
umbrage
of
the
pines
,
seemed
,
but
for
the
difficulties
of
its
*NL*
descent
,
that
path
to
Avernus
of
which
Virgil
speaks
.
Teresa
had
become
*NL*
alarmed
at
the
wild
and
deserted
look
of
the
plain
around
her
,
and
*NL*
pressed
closely
against
her
guide
,
not
uttering
a
syllable
;
but
as
she
*NL*
saw
him
advance
with
even
step
and
composed
countenance
,
she
endeavored
*NL*
to
repress
her
emotion
.
Suddenly
,
about
ten
paces
from
them
,
a
man
*NL*
advanced
from
behind
a
tree
and
aimed
at
Vampa
.
--
`
Not
another
step
,
'
he
*NL*
said
,
`
or
you
are
a
dead
man
.
'
--
`
What
,
then
,
'
said
Vampa
,
raising
his
*NL*
hand
with
a
gesture
of
disdain
,
while
Teresa
,
no
longer
able
to
restrain
*NL*
her
alarm
,
clung
closely
to
him
,
`
do
wolves
rend
each
other
?
'
--
`
Who
*NL*
are
you
?
'
inquired
the
sentinel
.
--
'
I
am
Luigi
Vampa
,
shepherd
of
*NL*
the
San-Felice
farm
.
'
--
`
What
do
you
want
?
'
--
'
I
would
speak
with
your
*NL*
companions
who
are
in
the
glade
at
Rocca
Bianca
.
'
--
`
Follow
me
,
then
,
'
*NL*
said
the
sentinel
;
`
or
,
as
you
know
your
way
,
go
first
.
'
--
Vampa
smiled
*NL*
disdainfully
at
this
precaution
on
the
part
of
the
bandit
,
went
before
*NL*
Teresa
,
and
continued
to
advance
with
the
same
firm
and
easy
step
as
*NL*
before
.
At
the
end
of
ten
minutes
the
bandit
made
them
a
sign
to
stop
.
*NL*
The
two
young
persons
obeyed
.
Then
the
bandit
thrice
imitated
the
cry
of
*NL*
a
crow
;
a
croak
answered
this
signal
.
--
`
Good
!
'
said
the
sentry
,
`
you
may
*NL*
now
go
on
.
'
--
Luigi
and
Teresa
again
set
forward
;
as
they
went
on
*NL*
Teresa
clung
tremblingly
to
her
lover
at
the
sight
of
weapons
and
the
*NL*
glistening
of
carbines
through
the
trees
.
The
retreat
of
Rocca
Bianca
*NL*
was
at
the
top
of
a
small
mountain
,
which
no
doubt
in
former
days
*NL*
had
been
a
volcano
--
an
extinct
volcano
before
the
days
when
Remus
and
*NL*
Romulus
had
deserted
Alba
to
come
and
found
the
city
of
Rome
.
Teresa
*NL*
and
Luigi
reached
the
summit
,
and
all
at
once
found
themselves
in
the
*NL*
presence
of
twenty
bandits
.
`
Here
is
a
young
man
who
seeks
and
wishes
*NL*
to
speak
to
you
,
'
said
the
sentinel
.
--
`
What
has
he
to
say
?
'
inquired
*NL*
the
young
man
who
was
in
command
in
the
chief
's
absence
.
--
'
I
wish
to
*NL*
say
that
I
am
tired
of
a
shepherd
's
life
,
'
was
Vampa
's
reply
.
--
`
Ah
,
*NL*
I
understand
,
'
said
the
lieutenant
;
`
and
you
seek
admittance
into
our
*NL*
ranks
?
'
--
`
Welcome
!
'
cried
several
bandits
from
Ferrusino
,
Pampinara
,
*NL*
and
Anagni
,
who
had
recognized
Luigi
Vampa
.
--
`
Yes
,
but
I
came
to
ask
*NL*
something
more
than
to
be
your
companion
.
'
--
`
And
what
may
that
be
?
'
*NL*
inquired
the
bandits
with
astonishment
.
--
'
I
come
to
ask
to
be
your
*NL*
captain
,
'
said
the
young
man
.
The
bandits
shouted
with
laughter
.
*NL*
`
And
what
have
you
done
to
aspire
to
this
honor
?
'
demanded
the
*NL*
lieutenant
.
--
'
I
have
killed
your
chief
,
Cucumetto
,
whose
dress
I
now
*NL*
wear
;
and
I
set
fire
to
the
villa
San-Felice
to
procure
a
wedding-dress
*NL*
for
my
betrothed
.
'
An
hour
afterwards
Luigi
Vampa
was
chosen
captain
,
*NL*
vice
Cucumetto
deceased
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
my
dear
Albert
,
''
said
Franz
,
turning
towards
his
friend
;
``
what
*NL*
think
you
of
citizen
Luigi
Vampa
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
he
is
a
myth
,
''
replied
Albert
,
``
and
never
had
an
existence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
may
a
myth
be
?
''
inquired
Pastrini
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
explanation
would
be
too
long
,
my
dear
landlord
,
''
replied
Franz
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
say
that
Signor
Vampa
exercises
his
profession
at
this
moment
*NL*
in
the
environs
of
Rome
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
with
a
boldness
of
which
no
bandit
before
him
ever
gave
an
*NL*
example
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
the
police
have
vainly
tried
to
lay
hands
on
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
you
see
,
he
has
a
good
understanding
with
the
shepherds
in
the
*NL*
plains
,
the
fishermen
of
the
Tiber
,
and
the
smugglers
of
the
coast
.
They
*NL*
seek
for
him
in
the
mountains
,
and
he
is
on
the
waters
;
they
follow
him
*NL*
on
the
waters
,
and
he
is
on
the
open
sea
;
then
they
pursue
him
,
and
he
*NL*
has
suddenly
taken
refuge
in
the
islands
,
at
Giglio
,
Guanouti
,
or
Monte
*NL*
Cristo
;
and
when
they
hunt
for
him
there
,
he
reappears
suddenly
at
*NL*
Albano
,
Tivoli
,
or
La
Riccia
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
does
he
behave
towards
travellers
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas
!
his
plan
is
very
simple
.
It
depends
on
the
distance
he
may
be
*NL*
from
the
city
,
whether
he
gives
eight
hours
,
twelve
hours
,
or
a
day
*NL*
wherein
to
pay
their
ransom
;
and
when
that
time
has
elapsed
he
allows
*NL*
another
hour
's
grace
.
At
the
sixtieth
minute
of
this
hour
,
if
the
*NL*
money
is
not
forthcoming
,
he
blows
out
the
prisoner
's
brains
with
a
*NL*
pistol-shot
,
or
plants
his
dagger
in
his
heart
,
and
that
settles
the
*NL*
account
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Albert
,
''
inquired
Franz
of
his
companion
,
``
are
you
still
disposed
*NL*
to
go
to
the
Colosseum
by
the
outer
wall
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
so
,
''
said
Albert
,
``
if
the
way
be
picturesque
.
''
The
clock
struck
*NL*
nine
as
the
door
opened
,
and
a
coachman
appeared
.
``
Excellencies
,
''
said
*NL*
he
,
``
the
coach
is
ready
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
''
said
Franz
,
``
let
us
to
the
Colosseum
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
the
Porta
del
Popolo
or
by
the
streets

your
excellencies

*NL*
*NL*
``
By

morbleu

cried
Franz
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

my
dear
fellow

''
said
Albert
,
rising
,
and
lighting
his
third
cigar
,
*NL*
``
really
,
I
thought
you
had
more
courage
.
''
So
saying
,
the
two
young
men
*NL*
went
down
the
staircase
,
and
got
into
the
carriage
.

*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
34
.
The
Colosseum
.
*NL*
*NL*
Franz
had
so
managed
his
route
,
that
during
the
ride
to
the
Colosseum
*NL*
they
passed
not
a
single
ancient
ruin
,
so
that
no
preliminary
impression
*NL*
interfered
to
mitigate
the
colossal
proportions
of
the
gigantic
building
*NL*
they
came
to
admire
.
The
road
selected
was
a
continuation
of
the
Via
*NL*
Sistina
;
then
by
cutting
off
the
right
angle
of
the
street
in
which
*NL*
stands
Santa
Maria
Maggiore
and
proceeding
by
the
Via
Urbana
and
*NL*
San
Pietro
in
Vincoli
,
the
travellers
would
find
themselves
directly
*NL*
opposite
the
Colosseum
.
This
itinerary
possessed
another
great
*NL*
advantage
,
--
that
of
leaving
Franz
at
full
liberty
to
indulge
his
deep
*NL*
reverie
upon
the
subject
of
Signor
Pastrini
's
story
,
in
which
his
*NL*
mysterious
host
of
Monte
Cristo
was
so
strangely
mixed
up
.
Seated
with
*NL*
folded
arms
in
a
corner
of
the
carriage
,
he
continued
to
ponder
over
*NL*
the
singular
history
he
had
so
lately
listened
to
,
and
to
ask
himself
*NL*
an
interminable
number
of
questions
touching
its
various
circumstances
*NL*
without
,
however
,
arriving
at
a
satisfactory
reply
to
any
of
them
.
One
*NL*
fact
more
than
the
rest
brought
his
friend
``
Sinbad
the
Sailor
''
back
*NL*
to
his
recollection
,
and
that
was
the
mysterious
sort
of
intimacy
that
*NL*
seemed
to
exist
between
the
brigands
and
the
sailors
;
and
Pastrini
's
*NL*
account
of
Vampa
's
having
found
refuge
on
board
the
vessels
of
smugglers
*NL*
and
fishermen
,
reminded
Franz
of
the
two
Corsican
bandits
he
had
found
*NL*
supping
so
amicably
with
the
crew
of
the
little
yacht
,
which
had
even
*NL*
deviated
from
its
course
and
touched
at
Porto-Vecchio
for
the
sole
*NL*
purpose
of
landing
them
.
The
very
name
assumed
by
his
host
of
Monte
*NL*
Cristo
and
again
repeated
by
the
landlord
of
the
Hotel
de
Londres
,
*NL*
abundantly
proved
to
him
that
his
island
friend
was
playing
his
*NL*
philanthropic
part
on
the
shores
of
Piombino
,
Civita-Vecchio
,
Ostia
,
and
*NL*
Gaeta
,
as
on
those
of
Corsica
,
Tuscany
,
and
Spain
;
and
further
,
Franz
*NL*
bethought
him
of
having
heard
his
singular
entertainer
speak
both
*NL*
of
Tunis
and
Palermo
,
proving
thereby
how
largely
his
circle
of
*NL*
acquaintances
extended
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
however
the
mind
of
the
young
man
might
be
absorbed
in
these
*NL*
reflections
,
they
were
at
once
dispersed
at
the
sight
of
the
dark
*NL*
frowning
ruins
of
the
stupendous
Colosseum
,
through
the
various
openings
*NL*
of
which
the
pale
moonlight
played
and
flickered
like
the
unearthly
*NL*
gleam
from
the
eyes
of
the
wandering
dead
.
The
carriage
stopped
near
the
*NL*
Meta
Sudans
;
the
door
was
opened
,
and
the
young
men
,
eagerly
alighting
,
*NL*
found
themselves
opposite
a
cicerone
,
who
appeared
to
have
sprung
up
*NL*
from
the
ground
,
so
unexpected
was
his
appearance
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
usual
guide
from
the
hotel
having
followed
them
,
they
had
paid
two
*NL*
conductors
,
nor
is
it
possible
,
at
Rome
,
to
avoid
this
abundant
supply
*NL*
of
guides
;
besides
the
ordinary
cicerone
,
who
seizes
upon
you
directly
*NL*
you
set
foot
in
your
hotel
,
and
never
quits
you
while
you
remain
in
the
*NL*
city
,
there
is
also
a
special
cicerone
belonging
to
each
monument
--
nay
,
*NL*
almost
to
each
part
of
a
monument
.
It
may
,
therefore
,
be
easily
imagined
*NL*
there
is
no
scarcity
of
guides
at
the
Colosseum
,
that
wonder
of
all
*NL*
ages
,
which
Martial
thus
eulogizes
:
``
Let
Memphis
cease
to
boast
the
*NL*
barbarous
miracles
of
her
pyramids
,
and
the
wonders
of
Babylon
be
talked
*NL*
of
no
more
among
us
;
all
must
bow
to
the
superiority
of
the
gigantic
*NL*
labor
of
the
Caesars
,
and
the
many
voices
of
Fame
spread
far
and
wide
*NL*
the
surpassing
merits
of
this
incomparable
monument
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
Albert
and
Franz
,
they
essayed
not
to
escape
from
their
*NL*
ciceronian
tyrants
;
and
,
indeed
,
it
would
have
been
so
much
the
more
*NL*
difficult
to
break
their
bondage
,
as
the
guides
alone
are
permitted
to
*NL*
visit
these
monuments
with
torches
in
their
hands
.
Thus
,
then
,
the
*NL*
young
men
made
no
attempt
at
resistance
,
but
blindly
and
confidingly
*NL*
surrendered
themselves
into
the
care
and
custody
of
their
conductors
.
*NL*
Albert
had
already
made
seven
or
eight
similar
excursions
to
the
*NL*
Colosseum
,
while
his
less
favored
companion
trod
for
the
first
time
in
*NL*
his
life
the
classic
ground
forming
the
monument
of
Flavius
Vespasian
;
*NL*
and
,
to
his
credit
be
it
spoken
,
his
mind
,
even
amid
the
glib
loquacity
*NL*
of
the
guides
,
was
duly
and
deeply
touched
with
awe
and
enthusiastic
*NL*
admiration
of
all
he
saw
;
and
certainly
no
adequate
notion
of
these
*NL*
stupendous
ruins
can
be
formed
save
by
such
as
have
visited
them
,
and
*NL*
more
especially
by
moonlight
,
at
which
time
the
vast
proportions
of
the
*NL*
building
appear
twice
as
large
when
viewed
by
the
mysterious
beams
of
*NL*
a
southern
moonlit
sky
,
whose
rays
are
sufficiently
clear
and
vivid
to
*NL*
light
the
horizon
with
a
glow
equal
to
the
soft
twilight
of
an
eastern
*NL*
clime
.
Scarcely
,
therefore
,
had
the
reflective
Franz
walked
a
hundred
*NL*
steps
beneath
the
interior
porticoes
of
the
ruin
,
than
,
abandoning
*NL*
Albert
to
the
guides
-LRB-
who
would
by
no
means
yield
their
prescriptive
*NL*
right
of
carrying
their
victims
through
the
routine
regularly
laid
down
,
*NL*
and
as
regularly
followed
by
them
,
but
dragged
the
unconscious
visitor
*NL*
to
the
various
objects
with
a
pertinacity
that
admitted
of
no
appeal
,
*NL*
beginning
,
as
a
matter
of
course
,
with
the
Lions
'
Den
,
and
finishing
*NL*
with
Caesar
's
``
Podium
,
''
-RRB-
,
to
escape
a
jargon
and
mechanical
survey
*NL*
of
the
wonders
by
which
he
was
surrounded
,
Franz
ascended
a
*NL*
half-dilapidated
staircase
,
and
,
leaving
them
to
follow
their
monotonous
*NL*
round
,
seated
himself
at
the
foot
of
a
column
,
and
immediately
opposite
*NL*
a
large
aperture
,
which
permitted
him
to
enjoy
a
full
and
undisturbed
*NL*
view
of
the
gigantic
dimensions
of
the
majestic
ruin
.
*NL*
*NL*
Franz
had
remained
for
nearly
a
quarter
of
an
hour
perfectly
hidden
*NL*
by
the
shadow
of
the
vast
column
at
whose
base
he
had
found
a
*NL*
resting-place
,
and
from
whence
his
eyes
followed
the
motions
of
Albert
*NL*
and
his
guides
,
who
,
holding
torches
in
their
hands
,
had
emerged
from
*NL*
a
vomitarium
at
the
opposite
extremity
of
the
Colosseum
,
and
then
again
*NL*
disappeared
down
the
steps
conducting
to
the
seats
reserved
for
the
*NL*
Vestal
virgins
,
resembling
,
as
they
glided
along
,
some
restless
shades
*NL*
following
the
flickering
glare
of
so
many
ignes-fatui
.
All
at
once
his
*NL*
ear
caught
a
sound
resembling
that
of
a
stone
rolling
down
the
staircase
*NL*
opposite
the
one
by
which
he
had
himself
ascended
.
There
was
nothing
*NL*
remarkable
in
the
circumstance
of
a
fragment
of
granite
giving
way
and
*NL*
falling
heavily
below
;
but
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
substance
that
fell
*NL*
gave
way
beneath
the
pressure
of
a
foot
,
and
also
that
some
one
,
who
*NL*
endeavored
as
much
as
possible
to
prevent
his
footsteps
from
being
*NL*
heard
,
was
approaching
the
spot
where
he
sat
.
Conjecture
soon
became
*NL*
certainty
,
for
the
figure
of
a
man
was
distinctly
visible
to
Franz
,
*NL*
gradually
emerging
from
the
staircase
opposite
,
upon
which
the
moon
was
*NL*
at
that
moment
pouring
a
full
tide
of
silvery
brightness
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
stranger
thus
presenting
himself
was
probably
a
person
who
,
like
*NL*
Franz
,
preferred
the
enjoyment
of
solitude
and
his
own
thoughts
to
*NL*
the
frivolous
gabble
of
the
guides
.
And
his
appearance
had
nothing
*NL*
extraordinary
in
it
;
but
the
hesitation
with
which
he
proceeded
,
*NL*
stopping
and
listening
with
anxious
attention
at
every
step
he
took
,
*NL*
convinced
Franz
that
he
expected
the
arrival
of
some
person
.
By
a
sort
*NL*
of
instinctive
impulse
,
Franz
withdrew
as
much
as
possible
behind
his
*NL*
pillar
.
About
ten
feet
from
the
spot
where
he
and
the
stranger
were
,
the
*NL*
roof
had
given
way
,
leaving
a
large
round
opening
,
through
which
might
*NL*
be
seen
the
blue
vault
of
heaven
,
thickly
studded
with
stars
.
Around
*NL*
this
opening
,
which
had
,
possibly
,
for
ages
permitted
a
free
entrance
*NL*
to
the
brilliant
moonbeams
that
now
illumined
the
vast
pile
,
grew
a
*NL*
quantity
of
creeping
plants
,
whose
delicate
green
branches
stood
out
in
*NL*
bold
relief
against
the
clear
azure
of
the
firmament
,
while
large
masses
*NL*
of
thick
,
strong
fibrous
shoots
forced
their
way
through
the
chasm
,
and
*NL*
hung
floating
to
and
fro
,
like
so
many
waving
strings
.
The
person
whose
*NL*
mysterious
arrival
had
attracted
the
attention
of
Franz
stood
in
a
kind
*NL*
of
half-light
,
that
rendered
it
impossible
to
distinguish
his
features
,
*NL*
although
his
dress
was
easily
made
out
.
He
wore
a
large
brown
mantle
,
*NL*
one
fold
of
which
,
thrown
over
his
left
shoulder
,
served
likewise
*NL*
to
mask
the
lower
part
of
his
countenance
,
while
the
upper
part
was
*NL*
completely
hidden
by
his
broad-brimmed
hat
.
The
lower
part
of
his
dress
*NL*
was
more
distinctly
visible
by
the
bright
rays
of
the
moon
,
which
,
*NL*
entering
through
the
broken
ceiling
,
shed
their
refulgent
beams
on
feet
*NL*
cased
in
elegantly
made
boots
of
polished
leather
,
over
which
descended
*NL*
fashionably
cut
trousers
of
black
cloth
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
imperfect
means
Franz
had
of
judging
,
he
could
only
come
to
*NL*
one
conclusion
,
--
that
the
person
whom
he
was
thus
watching
certainly
*NL*
belonged
to
no
inferior
station
of
life
.
Some
few
minutes
had
elapsed
,
*NL*
and
the
stranger
began
to
show
manifest
signs
of
impatience
,
when
a
*NL*
slight
noise
was
heard
outside
the
aperture
in
the
roof
,
and
almost
*NL*
immediately
a
dark
shadow
seemed
to
obstruct
the
flood
of
light
that
had
*NL*
entered
it
,
and
the
figure
of
a
man
was
clearly
seen
gazing
with
eager
*NL*
scrutiny
on
the
immense
space
beneath
him
;
then
,
as
his
eye
caught
*NL*
sight
of
him
in
the
mantle
,
he
grasped
a
floating
mass
of
thickly
matted
*NL*
boughs
,
and
glided
down
by
their
help
to
within
three
or
four
feet
*NL*
of
the
ground
,
and
then
leaped
lightly
on
his
feet
.
The
man
who
had
*NL*
performed
this
daring
act
with
so
much
indifference
wore
the
Transtevere
*NL*
costume
.
``
I
beg
your
excellency
's
pardon
for
keeping
you
waiting
,
''
said
*NL*
the
man
,
in
the
Roman
dialect
,
``
but
I
do
n't
think
I
'm
many
minutes
after
*NL*
my
time

ten
o'clock

on
the
Lateran

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
not
a

replied
the
stranger
in
purest
*NL*
Tuscan
;

But
even
if
you
had
caused

while

I
should
have
felt
quite
sure
that
the
delay
was
not
*NL*
occasioned
by
any
fault
of
yours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
excellency
is
perfectly
right
in
so
thinking

said
the
man
;

I
*NL*
came
here
direct
from

trouble
before

*NL*

And

*NL*
*NL*
``

may
be
very
glad

out

of

*NL*
``
Briefly

did
you
glean

*NL*
*NL*
``
That

is
customary

*NL*
Saying
these
words
,
the
Transteverin
disappeared
down
the
staircase
,
*NL*
while
his
companion
,
muffling
his
features
more
closely
than
before
in
*NL*
the
folds
of
his
mantle
,
passed
almost
close
to
Franz
,
and
descended
*NL*
to
the
arena
by
an
outward
flight
of
steps
.
The
next
minute
Franz
heard
*NL*
himself
called
by
Albert
,
who
made
the
lofty
building
re-echo
with
the
*NL*
sound
of
his
friend
's
name
.
Franz
,
however
,
did
not
obey
the
summons
*NL*
till
he
had
satisfied
himself
that
the
two
men
whose
conversation
he
had
*NL*
overheard
were
at
a
sufficient
distance
to
prevent
his
encountering
them
*NL*
in
his
descent
.
In
ten
minutes
after
the
strangers
had
departed
,
*NL*
Franz
was
on
the
road
to
the
Piazza
de
Spagni
,
listening
with
studied
*NL*
indifference
to
the
learned
dissertation
delivered
by
Albert
,
after
the
*NL*
manner
of
Pliny
and
Calpurnius
,
touching
the
iron-pointed
nets
used
to
*NL*
prevent
the
ferocious
beasts
from
springing
on
the
spectators
.
Franz
let
*NL*
him
proceed
without
interruption
,
and
,
in
fact
,
did
not
hear
what
*NL*
was
said
;
he
longed
to
be
alone
,
and
free
to
ponder
over
all
that
had
*NL*
occurred
.
One
of
the
two
men
,
whose
mysterious
meeting
in
the
Colosseum
*NL*
he
had
so
unintentionally
witnessed
,
was
an
entire
stranger
to
him
,
but
*NL*
not
so
the
other
;
and
though
Franz
had
been
unable
to
distinguish
his
*NL*
features
,
from
his
being
either
wrapped
in
his
mantle
or
obscured
by
the
*NL*
shadow
,
the
tones
of
his
voice
had
made
too
powerful
an
impression
on
*NL*
him
the
first
time
he
had
heard
them
for
him
ever
again
to
forget
them
,
*NL*
hear
them
when
or
where
he
might
.
It
was
more
especially
when
this
man
*NL*
was
speaking
in
a
manner
half
jesting
,
half
bitter
,
that
Franz
's
ear
*NL*
recalled
most
vividly
the
deep
sonorous
,
yet
well-pitched
voice
that
had
*NL*
addressed
him
in
the
grotto
of
Monte
Cristo
,
and
which
he
heard
for
the
*NL*
second
time
amid
the
darkness
and
ruined
grandeur
of
the
Colosseum
.
And
*NL*
the
more
he
thought
,
the
more
entire
was
his
conviction
,
that
the
person
*NL*
who
wore
the
mantle
was
no
other
than
his
former
host
and
entertainer
,
*NL*
``
Sinbad
the
Sailor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Under
any
other
circumstances
,
Franz
would
have
found
it
impossible
to
*NL*
resist
his
extreme
curiosity
to
know
more
of
so
singular
a
personage
,
*NL*
and
with
that
intent
have
sought
to
renew
their
short
acquaintance
;
but
*NL*
in
the
present
instance
,
the
confidential
nature
of
the
conversation
*NL*
he
had
overheard
made
him
,
with
propriety
,
judge
that
his
appearance
at
*NL*
such
a
time
would
be
anything
but
agreeable
.
As
we
have
seen
,
therefore
,
*NL*
he
permitted
his
former
host
to
retire
without
attempting
a
recognition
,
*NL*
but
fully
promising
himself
a
rich
indemnity
for
his
present
forbearance
*NL*
should
chance
afford
him
another
opportunity
.
In
vain
did
Franz
endeavor
*NL*
to
forget
the
many
perplexing
thoughts
which
assailed
him
;
in
vain
did
*NL*
he
court
the
refreshment
of
sleep
.
Slumber
refused
to
visit
his
eyelids
*NL*
and
the
night
was
passed
in
feverish
contemplation
of
the
chain
of
*NL*
circumstances
tending
to
prove
the
identity
of
the
mysterious
visitant
*NL*
to
the
Colosseum
with
the
inhabitant
of
the
grotto
of
Monte
Cristo
;
and
*NL*
the
more
he
thought
,
the
firmer
grew
his
opinion
on
the
subject
.
Worn
*NL*
out
at
length
,
he
fell
asleep
at
daybreak
,
and
did
not
awake
till
late
.
*NL*
Like
a
genuine
Frenchman
,
Albert
had
employed
his
time
in
arranging
*NL*
for
the
evening
's
diversion
;
he
had
sent
to
engage
a
box
at
the
Teatro
*NL*
Argentino
;
and
Franz
,
having
a
number
of
letters
to
write
,
relinquished
*NL*
the
carriage
to
Albert
for
the
whole
of
the
day
.
At
five
o'clock
Albert
*NL*
returned
,
delighted
with
his
day
's
work
;
he
had
been
occupied
in
leaving
*NL*
his
letters
of
introduction
,
and
had
received
in
return
more
invitations
*NL*
to
balls
and
routs
than
it
would
be
possible
for
him
to
accept
;
besides
*NL*
this
,
he
had
seen
-LRB-
as
he
called
it
-RRB-
all
the
remarkable
sights
at
Rome
.
*NL*
Yes
,
in
a
single
day
he
had
accomplished
what
his
more
serious-minded
*NL*
companion
would
have
taken
weeks
to
effect
.
Neither
had
he
neglected
to
*NL*
ascertain
the
name
of
the
piece
to
be
played
that
night
at
the
Teatro
*NL*
Argentino
,
and
also
what
performers
appeared
in
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
opera
of
``
Parisina
''
was
announced
for
representation
,
and
the
*NL*
principal
actors
were
Coselli
,
Moriani
,
and
La
Specchia
.
The
young
men
,
*NL*
therefore
,
had
reason
to
consider
themselves
fortunate
in
having
the
*NL*
opportunity
of
hearing
one
of
the
best
works
by
the
composer
of
``
Lucia
*NL*
di
Lammermoor
,
''
supported
by
three
of
the
most
renowned
vocalists
of
*NL*
Italy
.
Albert
had
never
been
able
to
endure
the
Italian
theatres
,
with
*NL*
their
orchestras
from
which
it
is
impossible
to
see
,
and
the
absence
of
*NL*
balconies
,
or
open
boxes
;
all
these
defects
pressed
hard
on
a
man
who
*NL*
had
had
his
stall
at
the
Bouffes
,
and
had
shared
a
lower
box
at
the
*NL*
Opera
.
Still
,
in
spite
of
this
,
Albert
displayed
his
most
dazzling
and
*NL*
effective
costumes
each
time
he
visited
the
theatres
;
but
,
alas
,
his
*NL*
elegant
toilet
was
wholly
thrown
away
,
and
one
of
the
most
worthy
*NL*
representatives
of
Parisian
fashion
had
to
carry
with
him
the
mortifying
*NL*
reflection
that
he
had
nearly
overrun
Italy
without
meeting
with
a
*NL*
single
adventure
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
Albert
would
affect
to
make
a
joke
of
his
want
of
success
;
but
*NL*
internally
he
was
deeply
wounded
,
and
his
self-love
immensely
piqued
,
to
*NL*
think
that
Albert
de
Morcerf
,
the
most
admired
and
most
sought
after
of
*NL*
any
young
person
of
his
day
,
should
thus
be
passed
over
,
and
merely
have
*NL*
his
labor
for
his
pains
.
And
the
thing
was
so
much
the
more
annoying
,
*NL*
as
,
according
to
the
characteristic
modesty
of
a
Frenchman
,
Albert
had
*NL*
quitted
Paris
with
the
full
conviction
that
he
had
only
to
show
himself
*NL*
in
Italy
to
carry
all
before
him
,
and
that
upon
his
return
he
*NL*
should
astonish
the
Parisian
world
with
the
recital
of
his
numerous
*NL*
love-affairs
.
Alas
,
poor
Albert
!
none
of
those
interesting
adventures
*NL*
fell
in
his
way
;
the
lovely
Genoese
,
Florentines
,
and
Neapolitans
were
*NL*
all
faithful
,
if
not
to
their
husbands
,
at
least
to
their
lovers
,
and
*NL*
thought
not
of
changing
even
for
the
splendid
appearance
of
Albert
de
*NL*
Morcerf
;
and
all
he
gained
was
the
painful
conviction
that
the
ladies
of
*NL*
Italy
have
this
advantage
over
those
of
France
,
that
they
are
faithful
*NL*
even
in
their
infidelity
.
Yet
he
could
not
restrain
a
hope
that
in
*NL*
Italy
,
as
elsewhere
,
there
might
be
an
exception
to
the
general
rule
.
*NL*
Albert
,
besides
being
an
elegant
,
well-looking
young
man
,
was
also
*NL*
possessed
of
considerable
talent
and
ability
;
moreover
,
he
was
a
*NL*
viscount
--
a
recently
created
one
,
certainly
,
but
in
the
present
day
it
*NL*
is
not
necessary
to
go
as
far
back
as
Noah
in
tracing
a
descent
,
and
*NL*
a
genealogical
tree
is
equally
estimated
,
whether
dated
from
1399
*NL*
or
merely
1815
;
but
to
crown
all
these
advantages
,
Albert
de
Morcerf
*NL*
commanded
an
income
of
50,000
livres
,
a
more
than
sufficient
sum
to
*NL*
render
him
a
personage
of
considerable
importance
in
Paris
.
It
was
*NL*
therefore
no
small
mortification
to
him
to
have
visited
most
of
the
*NL*
principal
cities
in
Italy
without
having
excited
the
most
trifling
*NL*
observation
.
Albert
,
however
,
hoped
to
indemnify
himself
for
all
these
*NL*
slights
and
indifferences
during
the
Carnival
,
knowing
full
well
that
*NL*
among
the
different
states
and
kingdoms
in
which
this
festivity
is
*NL*
celebrated
,
Rome
is
the
spot
where
even
the
wisest
and
gravest
throw
off
*NL*
the
usual
rigidity
of
their
lives
,
and
deign
to
mingle
in
the
follies
of
*NL*
this
time
of
liberty
and
relaxation
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Carnival
was
to
commence
on
the
morrow
;
therefore
Albert
had
not
*NL*
an
instant
to
lose
in
setting
forth
the
programme
of
his
hopes
,
*NL*
expectations
,
and
claims
to
notice
.
With
this
design
he
had
engaged
a
*NL*
box
in
the
most
conspicuous
part
of
the
theatre
,
and
exerted
himself
*NL*
to
set
off
his
personal
attractions
by
the
aid
of
the
most
rich
and
*NL*
elaborate
toilet
.
The
box
taken
by
Albert
was
in
the
first
circle
;
*NL*
although
each
of
the
three
tiers
of
boxes
is
deemed
equally
*NL*
aristocratic
,
and
is
,
for
this
reason
,
generally
styled
the
``
nobility
's
*NL*
boxes
,
''
and
although
the
box
engaged
for
the
two
friends
was
*NL*
sufficiently
capacious
to
contain
at
least
a
dozen
persons
,
it
had
cost
*NL*
less
than
would
be
paid
at
some
of
the
French
theatres
for
one
admitting
*NL*
merely
four
occupants
.
Another
motive
had
influenced
Albert
's
selection
*NL*
of
his
seat
,
--
who
knew
but
that
,
thus
advantageously
placed
,
he
might
*NL*
not
in
truth
attract
the
notice
of
some
fair
Roman
,
and
an
introduction
*NL*
might
ensue
that
would
procure
him
the
offer
of
a
seat
in
a
carriage
,
or
*NL*
a
place
in
a
princely
balcony
,
from
which
he
might
behold
the
gayeties
*NL*
of
the
Carnival
?
These
united
considerations
made
Albert
more
lively
and
*NL*
anxious
to
please
than
he
had
hitherto
been
.
Totally
disregarding
the
*NL*
business
of
the
stage
,
he
leaned
from
his
box
and
began
attentively
*NL*
scrutinizing
the
beauty
of
each
pretty
woman
,
aided
by
a
powerful
*NL*
opera-glass
;
but
,
alas
,
this
attempt
to
attract
notice
wholly
failed
;
*NL*
not
even
curiosity
had
been
excited
,
and
it
was
but
too
apparent
*NL*
that
the
lovely
creatures
,
into
whose
good
graces
he
was
desirous
of
*NL*
stealing
,
were
all
so
much
engrossed
with
themselves
,
their
lovers
,
*NL*
or
their
own
thoughts
,
that
they
had
not
so
much
as
noticed
him
or
the
*NL*
manipulation
of
his
glass
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
truth
was
,
that
the
anticipated
pleasures
of
the
Carnival
,
with
the
*NL*
``
holy
week
''
that
was
to
succeed
it
,
so
filled
every
fair
breast
,
as
to
*NL*
prevent
the
least
attention
being
bestowed
even
on
the
business
of
the
*NL*
stage
.
The
actors
made
their
entries
and
exits
unobserved
or
unthought
*NL*
of
;
at
certain
conventional
moments
,
the
spectators
would
suddenly
cease
*NL*
their
conversation
,
or
rouse
themselves
from
their
musings
,
to
listen
*NL*
to
some
brilliant
effort
of
Moriani
's
,
a
well-executed
recitative
by
*NL*
Coselli
,
or
to
join
in
loud
applause
at
the
wonderful
powers
of
La
*NL*
Specchia
;
but
that
momentary
excitement
over
,
they
quickly
relapsed
into
*NL*
their
former
state
of
preoccupation
or
interesting
conversation
.
Towards
*NL*
the
close
of
the
first
act
,
the
door
of
a
box
which
had
been
hitherto
*NL*
vacant
was
opened
;
a
lady
entered
to
whom
Franz
had
been
introduced
in
*NL*
Paris
,
where
indeed
,
he
had
imagined
she
still
was
.
The
quick
eye
of
*NL*
Albert
caught
the
involuntary
start
with
which
his
friend
beheld
the
new
*NL*
arrival
,
and
,
turning
to
him
,
he
said
hastily
,
``
Do
you
know
the
woman
*NL*
who
has
just
entered
that
box
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
what
do
you
think
of
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
she
is
perfectly
lovely
--
what
a
complexion
!
And
such
magnificent
*NL*
hair
!
Is
she
French
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
a
Venetian
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
her
name
is
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Countess
G
--
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
I
know
her
by
name
!
''
exclaimed
Albert
;
``
she
is
said
to
possess
as
*NL*
much
wit
and
cleverness
as
beauty
.
I
was
to
have
been
presented
to
her
*NL*
when
I
met
her
at
Madame
Villefort
's
ball
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
I
assist
you
in
repairing
your
negligence
?
''
asked
Franz
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
fellow
,
are
you
really
on
such
good
terms
with
her
as
to
*NL*
venture
to
take
me
to
her
box
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
I
have
only
had
the
honor
of
being
in
her
society
and
conversing
*NL*
with
her
three
or
four
times
in
my
life
;
but
you
know
that
even
such
*NL*
an
acquaintance
as
that
might
warrant
my
doing
what
you
ask
.
''
At
that
*NL*
instant
,
the
countess
perceived
Franz
,
and
graciously
waved
her
hand
to
*NL*
him
,
to
which
he
replied
by
a
respectful
inclination
of
the
head
.
``
Upon
*NL*
my
word
,
''
said
Albert
,
``
you
seem
to
be
on
excellent
terms
with
the
*NL*
beautiful
countess
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
mistaken
in
thinking
so
,
''
returned
Franz
calmly
;
``
but
you
*NL*
merely
fall
into
the
same
error
which
leads
so
many
of
our
countrymen
to
*NL*
commit
the
most
egregious
blunders
,
--
I
mean
that
of
judging
the
habits
*NL*
and
customs
of
Italy
and
Spain
by
our
Parisian
notions
;
believe
me
,
*NL*
nothing
is
more
fallacious
than
to
form
any
estimate
of
the
degree
of
*NL*
intimacy
you
may
suppose
existing
among
persons
by
the
familiar
terms
*NL*
they
seem
upon
;
there
is
a
similarity
of
feeling
at
this
instant
between
*NL*
ourselves
and
the
countess
--
nothing
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
there
,
indeed
,
my
good
fellow
?
Pray
tell
me
,
is
it
sympathy
of
*NL*
heart
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
of
taste
,
''
continued
Franz
gravely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
in
what
manner
has
this
congeniality
of
mind
been
evinced
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
the
countess
's
visiting
the
Colosseum
,
as
we
did
last
night
,
by
*NL*
moonlight
,
and
nearly
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
were
with
her
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
did
you
say
to
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
we
talked
of
the
illustrious
dead
of
whom
that
magnificent
ruin
is
*NL*
a
glorious
monument
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Upon
my
word
,
''
cried
Albert
,
``
you
must
have
been
a
very
entertaining
*NL*
companion
alone

all
but
alone
,
with
a
beautiful
woman
in
such
a
*NL*
place
of
sentiment
as
the
Colosseum
,
and
yet
to
find
nothing
better
a
*NL*
talk
about
than
the
dead
!
All
I
can
say
is
,
if
ever
I
should
get
such
a
*NL*
chance
,
the
living
should
be
my
theme
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
will
probably
find
your
theme
ill-chosen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
''
said
Albert
,
breaking
in
upon
his
discourse
,
``
never
mind
the
*NL*
past
;
let
us
only
remember
the
present

Are
you
not
going
to
keep
your

promise
of
introducing
me
to
the
fair
subject
of
our
remarks

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly

directly
the
curtain
falls
on

*NL*
``
What
a
confounded
time
this
first
act
takes

finish
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

yes

only
listen

charming

How

exquisitely
Coselli
sings

``
But

Well

``
At

admire

appearance
singing
with
a
*NL*
voice
like
a
woman
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
good
friend
,
''
said
Franz
,
turning
to
him
,
while
Albert
continued
to
*NL*
point
his
glass
at
every
box
in
the
theatre
,
``
you
seem
determined
not
to
*NL*
approve
;
you
are
really
too
difficult
to
please
.
''
The
curtain
at
length
*NL*
fell
on
the
performances
,
to
the
infinite
satisfaction
of
the
Viscount
*NL*
of
Morcerf
,
who
seized
his
hat
,
rapidly
passed
his
fingers
through
his
*NL*
hair
,
arranged
his
cravat
and
wristbands
,
and
signified
to
Franz
that
he
*NL*
was
waiting
for
him
to
lead
the
way
.
Franz
,
who
had
mutely
interrogated
*NL*
the
countess
,
and
received
from
her
a
gracious
smile
in
token
that
he
*NL*
would
be
welcome
,
sought
not
to
retard
the
gratification
of
Albert
's
*NL*
eager
impatience
,
but
began
at
once
the
tour
of
the
house
,
closely
*NL*
followed
by
Albert
,
who
availed
himself
of
the
few
minutes
required
*NL*
to
reach
the
opposite
side
of
the
theatre
to
settle
the
height
and
*NL*
smoothness
of
his
collar
,
and
to
arrange
the
lappets
of
his
coat
.
This
*NL*
important
task
was
just
completed
as
they
arrived
at
the
countess
's
box
.
*NL*
At
the
knock
,
the
door
was
immediately
opened
,
and
the
young
man
who
*NL*
was
seated
beside
the
countess
,
in
obedience
to
the
Italian
custom
,
*NL*
instantly
rose
and
surrendered
his
place
to
the
strangers
,
who
,
in
turn
,
*NL*
would
be
expected
to
retire
upon
the
arrival
of
other
visitors
.
*NL*
*NL*
Franz
presented
Albert
as
one
of
the
most
distinguished
young
men
of
the
*NL*
day
,
both
as
regarded
his
position
in
society
and
extraordinary
talents
;
*NL*
nor
did
he
say
more
than
the
truth
,
for
in
Paris
and
the
circle
in
*NL*
which
the
viscount
moved
,
he
was
looked
upon
and
cited
as
a
model
of
*NL*
perfection
.
Franz
added
that
his
companion
,
deeply
grieved
at
having
*NL*
been
prevented
the
honor
of
being
presented
to
the
countess
during
her
*NL*
sojourn
in
Paris
,
was
most
anxious
to
make
up
for
it
,
and
had
requested
*NL*
him
-LRB-
Franz
-RRB-
to
remedy
the
past
misfortune
by
conducting
him
to
her
box
,
*NL*
and
concluded
by
asking
pardon
for
his
presumption
in
having
taken
*NL*
it
upon
himself
to
do
so
.
The
countess
,
in
reply
,
bowed
gracefully
to
*NL*
Albert
,
and
extended
her
hand
with
cordial
kindness
to
Franz
;
then
,
*NL*
inviting
Albert
to
take
the
vacant
seat
beside
her
,
she
recommended
*NL*
Franz
to
take
the
next
best
,
if
he
wished
to
view
the
ballet
,
and
*NL*
pointed
to
the
one
behind
her
own
chair
.
Albert
was
soon
deeply
*NL*
engrossed
in
discoursing
upon
Paris
and
Parisian
matters
,
speaking
*NL*
to
the
countess
of
the
various
persons
they
both
knew
there
.
Franz
*NL*
perceived
how
completely
he
was
in
his
element
;
and
,
unwilling
to
*NL*
interfere
with
the
pleasure
he
so
evidently
felt
,
took
up
Albert
's
*NL*
glass
,
and
began
in
his
turn
to
survey
the
audience
.
Sitting
alone
,
in
*NL*
the
front
of
a
box
immediately
opposite
,
but
situated
on
the
third
*NL*
row
,
was
a
woman
of
exquisite
beauty
,
dressed
in
a
Greek
costume
,
which
*NL*
evidently
,
from
the
ease
and
grace
with
which
she
wore
it
,
was
her
*NL*
national
attire
.
Behind
her
,
but
in
deep
shadow
,
was
the
outline
of
a
*NL*
masculine
figure
;
but
the
features
of
this
latter
personage
it
was
not
*NL*
possible
to
distinguish
.
Franz
could
not
forbear
breaking
in
upon
the
*NL*
apparently
interesting
conversation
passing
between
the
countess
and
*NL*
Albert
,
to
inquire
of
the
former
if
she
knew
who
was
the
fair
Albanian
*NL*
opposite
,
since
beauty
such
as
hers
was
well
worthy
of
being
observed
by
*NL*
either
sex
.
``
All
I
can
tell
about
her
,
''
replied
the
countess
,
``
is
,
that
*NL*
she
has
been
at
Rome
since
the
beginning
of
the
season
;
for
I
saw
her
*NL*
where
she
now
sits
the
very
first
night
of
the
season
,
and
since
then
*NL*
she
has
never
missed
a
performance
.
Sometimes
she
is
accompanied
by
the
*NL*
person
who
is
now
with
her
,
and
at
others
she
is
merely
attended
by
a
*NL*
black
servant
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
do
you
think
of
her
personal
appearance
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
consider
her
perfectly
lovely
--
she
is
just
my
idea
of
what
Medora
*NL*
must
have
been
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Franz
and
the
countess
exchanged
a
smile
,
and
then
the
latter
resumed
*NL*
her
conversation
with
Albert
,
while
Franz
returned
to
his
previous
*NL*
survey
of
the
house
and
company
.
The
curtain
rose
on
the
ballet
,
which
*NL*
was
one
of
those
excellent
specimens
of
the
Italian
school
,
admirably
*NL*
arranged
and
put
on
the
stage
by
Henri
,
who
has
established
for
himself
*NL*
a
great
reputation
throughout
Italy
for
his
taste
and
skill
in
the
*NL*
choreographic
art
--
one
of
those
masterly
productions
of
grace
,
method
,
*NL*
and
elegance
in
which
the
whole
corps
de
ballet
,
from
the
principal
*NL*
dancers
to
the
humblest
supernumerary
,
are
all
engaged
on
the
stage
at
*NL*
the
same
time
;
and
a
hundred
and
fifty
persons
may
be
seen
exhibiting
*NL*
the
same
attitude
,
or
elevating
the
same
arm
or
leg
with
a
simultaneous
*NL*
movement
,
that
would
lead
you
to
suppose
that
but
one
mind
,
one
act
of
*NL*
volition
,
influenced
the
moving
mass
--
the
ballet
was
called
``
Poliska
.
''
*NL*
However
much
the
ballet
might
have
claimed
his
attention
,
Franz
was
too
*NL*
deeply
occupied
with
the
beautiful
Greek
to
take
any
note
of
it
;
while
*NL*
she
seemed
to
experience
an
almost
childlike
delight
in
watching
it
,
her
*NL*
eager
,
animated
looks
contrasting
strongly
with
the
utter
indifference
*NL*
of
her
companion
,
who
,
during
the
whole
time
the
piece
lasted
,
never
*NL*
even
moved
,
not
even
when
the
furious
,
crashing
din
produced
by
the
*NL*
trumpets
,
cymbals
,
and
Chinese
bells
sounded
their
loudest
from
the
*NL*
orchestra
.
Of
this
he
took
no
heed
,
but
was
,
as
far
as
appearances
might
*NL*
be
trusted
,
enjoying
soft
repose
and
bright
celestial
dreams
.
The
ballet
*NL*
at
length
came
to
a
close
,
and
the
curtain
fell
amid
the
loud
,
unanimous
*NL*
plaudits
of
an
enthusiastic
and
delighted
audience
.
*NL*
*NL*
Owing
to
the
very
judicious
plan
of
dividing
the
two
acts
of
the
opera
*NL*
with
a
ballet
,
the
pauses
between
the
performances
are
very
short
,
the
*NL*
singers
in
the
opera
having
time
to
repose
themselves
and
change
*NL*
their
costume
,
when
necessary
,
while
the
dancers
are
executing
their
*NL*
pirouettes
and
exhibiting
their
graceful
steps
.
The
overture
to
the
*NL*
second
act
began
;
and
,
at
the
first
sound
of
the
leader
's
bow
across
his
*NL*
violin
,
Franz
observed
the
sleeper
slowly
arise
and
approach
the
Greek
*NL*
girl
,
who
turned
around
to
say
a
few
words
to
him
,
and
then
,
leaning
*NL*
forward
again
on
the
railing
of
her
box
,
she
became
as
absorbed
as
*NL*
before
in
what
was
going
on
.
The
countenance
of
the
person
who
had
*NL*
addressed
her
remained
so
completely
in
the
shade
,
that
,
though
Franz
*NL*
tried
his
utmost
,
he
could
not
distinguish
a
single
feature
.
The
curtain
*NL*
rose
,
and
the
attention
of
Franz
was
attracted
by
the
actors
;
and
his
*NL*
eyes
turned
from
the
box
containing
the
Greek
girl
and
her
strange
*NL*
companion
to
watch
the
business
of
the
stage
.
*NL*
*NL*
Most
of
my
readers
are
aware
that
the
second
act
of
``
Parisina
''
opens
*NL*
with
the
celebrated
and
effective
duet
in
which
Parisina
,
while
*NL*
sleeping
,
betrays
to
Azzo
the
secret
of
her
love
for
Ugo
.
The
injured
*NL*
husband
goes
through
all
the
emotions
of
jealousy
,
until
conviction
*NL*
seizes
on
his
mind
,
and
then
,
in
a
frenzy
of
rage
and
indignation
,
*NL*
he
awakens
his
guilty
wife
to
tell
her
that
he
knows
her
guilt
and
to
*NL*
threaten
her
with
his
vengeance
.
This
duet
is
one
of
the
most
beautiful
,
*NL*
expressive
and
terrible
conceptions
that
has
ever
emanated
from
the
*NL*
fruitful
pen
of
Donizetti
.
Franz
now
listened
to
it
for
the
third
*NL*
time
;
yet
its
notes
,
so
tenderly
expressive
and
fearfully
grand
as
*NL*
the
wretched
husband
and
wife
give
vent
to
their
different
griefs
and
*NL*
passions
,
thrilled
through
the
soul
of
Franz
with
an
effect
equal
to
his
*NL*
first
emotions
upon
hearing
it
.
Excited
beyond
his
usual
calm
*NL*
demeanor
,
Franz
rose
with
the
audience
,
and
was
about
to
join
the
*NL*
loud
,
enthusiastic
applause
that
followed
;
but
suddenly
his
purpose
was
*NL*
arrested
,
his
hands
fell
by
his
sides
,
and
the
half-uttered
``
bravos
''
*NL*
expired
on
his
lips
.
The
occupant
of
the
box
in
which
the
Greek
girl
sat
*NL*
appeared
to
share
the
universal
admiration
that
prevailed
;
for
he
left
*NL*
his
seat
to
stand
up
in
front
,
so
that
,
his
countenance
being
fully
*NL*
revealed
,
Franz
had
no
difficulty
in
recognizing
him
as
the
mysterious
*NL*
inhabitant
of
Monte
Cristo
,
and
the
very
same
person
he
had
encountered
*NL*
the
preceding
evening
in
the
ruins
of
the
Colosseum
,
and
whose
voice
and
*NL*
figure
had
seemed
so
familiar
to
him
.
All
doubt
of
his
identity
was
now
*NL*
at
an
end
;
his
singular
host
evidently
resided
at
Rome
.
The
surprise
*NL*
and
agitation
occasioned
by
this
full
confirmation
of
Franz
's
former
*NL*
suspicion
had
no
doubt
imparted
a
corresponding
expression
to
his
*NL*
features
;
for
the
countess
,
after
gazing
with
a
puzzled
look
at
*NL*
his
face
,
burst
into
a
fit
of
laughter
,
and
begged
to
know
what
had
*NL*
happened
.
``
Countess
,
''
returned
Franz
,
totally
unheeding
her
raillery
,
``
I
*NL*
asked
you
a
short
time
since
if
you
knew
any
particulars
respecting
the
*NL*
Albanian
lady
opposite
;
I
must
now
beseech
you
to
inform
me
who
and
what
*NL*
is
her
husband
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
''
answered
the
countess
,
``
I
know
no
more
of
him
than
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
you
never
before
noticed
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
question
--
so
truly
French
!
Do
you
not
know
that
we
Italians
have
*NL*
eyes
only
for
the
man
we
love
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
True
,
''
replied
Franz
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
I
can
say
is
,
''
continued
the
countess
,
taking
up
the
lorgnette
,
*NL*
and
directing
it
toward
the
box
in
question
,
``
that
the
gentleman
,
whose
*NL*
history
I
am
unable
to
furnish
,
seems
to
me
as
though
he
had
just
*NL*
been
dug
up
;
he
looks
more
like
a
corpse
permitted
by
some
friendly
*NL*
grave-digger
to
quit
his
tomb
for
a
while
,
and
revisit
this
earth
of
*NL*
ours
,
than
anything
human
.
How
ghastly
pale
he
is
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
he
is
always
as
colorless
as
you
now
see
him
,
''
said
Franz
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
know
him
?
''
almost
screamed
the
countess
.
``
Oh
,
pray
do
,
for
*NL*
heaven
's
sake
,
tell
us
all
about
--
is
he
a
vampire
,
or
a
resuscitated
*NL*
corpse
,
or
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
fancy
I
have
seen
him
before
;
and
I
even
think
he
recognizes
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
can
well
understand
,
''
said
the
countess
,
shrugging
up
her
*NL*
beautiful
shoulders
,
as
though
an
involuntary
shudder
passed
through
her
*NL*
veins
,
``
that
those
who
have
once
seen
that
man
will
never
be
likely
*NL*
to
forget
him
.
''
The
sensation
experienced
by
Franz
was
evidently
not
*NL*
peculiar
to
himself
;
another
,
and
wholly
uninterested
person
,
felt
the
*NL*
same
unaccountable
awe
and
misgiving
.
``
Well
.
''
inquired
Franz
,
after
the
*NL*
countess
had
a
second
time
directed
her
lorgnette
at
the
box
,
``
what
do
*NL*
you
think
of
our
opposite
neighbor
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
that
he
is
no
other
than
Lord
Ruthven
himself
in
a
living
form
.
''
*NL*
This
fresh
allusion
to
Byron
-LSB-
*
-RSB-
drew
a
smile
to
Franz
's
countenance
;
*NL*
although
he
could
but
allow
that
if
anything
was
likely
to
induce
belief
*NL*
in
the
existence
of
vampires
,
it
would
be
the
presence
of
such
a
man
as
*NL*
the
mysterious
personage
before
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
positively
find
out
who
and
what
he
is
,
''
said
Franz
,
rising
from
*NL*
his
seat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
''
cried
the
countess
;
``
you
must
not
leave
me
.
I
depend
upon
you
*NL*
to
escort
me
home
.
Oh
,
indeed
,
I
can
not
permit
you
to
go

Scott
,
of
course
:
``
The
son
of
an
ill-fated
sire
,
and
the
*NL*
father
of
a
yet
more
unfortunate
family
,
bore
in
his
looks
*NL*
that
cast
of
inauspicious
melancholy
by
which
the
*NL*
physiognomists
of
that
time
pretended
to
distinguish
those
*NL*
who
were
predestined
to
a
violent
and
unhappy
death

The
*NL*
Abbot

*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
possible
,
''
whispered
Franz
,
``
that
you
entertain
any
fear
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
tell
you
,
''
answered
the
countess
.
``
Byron
had
the
most
perfect
*NL*
belief
in
the
existence
of
vampires
,
and
even
assured
me
that
he
had
*NL*
seen
them
.
The
description
he
gave
me
perfectly
corresponds
with
*NL*
the
features
and
character
of
the
man
before
us
.
Oh
,
he
is
the
exact
*NL*
personification
of
what
I
have
been
led
to
expect
!
The
coal-black
hair
,
*NL*
large
bright
,
glittering
eyes
,
in
which
a
wild
,
unearthly
fire
seems
*NL*
burning
,
--
the
same
ghastly
paleness
.
Then
observe
,
too
,
that
the
*NL*
woman
with
him
is
altogether
unlike
all
others
of
her
sex
.
She
is
a
*NL*
foreigner
--
a
stranger
.
Nobody
knows
who
she
is
,
or
where
she
comes
from
.
*NL*
No
doubt
she
belongs
to
the
same
horrible
race
he
does
,
and
is
,
like
*NL*
himself
,
a
dealer
in
magical
arts
.
I
entreat
of
you
not
to
go
near
*NL*
him
--
at
least
to-night
;
and
if
to-morrow
your
curiosity
still
continues
*NL*
as
great
,
pursue
your
researches
if
you
will
;
but
to-night
you
neither
*NL*
can
nor
shall
.
For
that
purpose
I
mean
to
keep
you
all
to
myself
.
''
Franz
*NL*
protested
he
could
not
defer
his
pursuit
till
the
following
day
,
for
*NL*
many
reasons
.
``
Listen
to
me
,
''
said
the
countess
,
``
and
do
not
be
so
very
*NL*
headstrong
.
I
am
going
home
.
I
have
a
party
at
my
house
to-night
,
and
*NL*
therefore
can
not
possibly
remain
till
the
end
of
the
opera
.
Now
,
I
*NL*
can
not
for
one
instant
believe
you
so
devoid
of
gallantry
as
to
refuse
a
*NL*
lady
your
escort
when
she
even
condescends
to
ask
you
for
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
nothing
else
left
for
Franz
to
do
but
to
take
up
his
hat
,
*NL*
open
the
door
of
the
box
,
and
offer
the
countess
his
arm
.
It
was
quite
*NL*
evident
,
by
her
manner
,
that
her
uneasiness
was
not
feigned
;
and
Franz
*NL*
himself
could
not
resist
a
feeling
of
superstitious
dread
--
so
much
*NL*
the
stronger
in
him
,
as
it
arose
from
a
variety
of
corroborative
*NL*
recollections
,
while
the
terror
of
the
countess
sprang
from
an
*NL*
instinctive
belief
,
originally
created
in
her
mind
by
the
wild
tales
she
*NL*
had
listened
to
till
she
believed
them
truths
.
Franz
could
even
feel
her
*NL*
arm
tremble
as
he
assisted
her
into
the
carriage
.
Upon
arriving
at
*NL*
her
hotel
,
Franz
perceived
that
she
had
deceived
him
when
she
spoke
of
*NL*
expecting
company
;
on
the
contrary
,
her
own
return
before
the
appointed
*NL*
hour
seemed
greatly
to
astonish
the
servants
.
``
Excuse
my
little
*NL*
subterfuge
,
''
said
the
countess
,
in
reply
to
her
companion
's
*NL*
half-reproachful
observation
on
the
subject
;
``
but
that
horrid
man
had
*NL*
made
me
feel
quite
uncomfortable
,
and
I
longed
to
be
alone
,
that
I
might
*NL*
compose
my
startled
mind
.
''
Franz
essayed
to
smile
.
``
Nay
,
''
said
she
,
``
do
*NL*
not
smile
;
it
ill
accords
with
the
expression
of
your
countenance
,
and
*NL*
I
am
sure
it
does
not
spring
from
your
heart
.
However
,
promise
me
one
*NL*
thing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Promise
me
,
I
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
do
anything
you
desire
,
except
relinquish
my
determination
of
*NL*
finding
out
who
this
man
is
.
I
have
more
reasons
than
you
can
imagine
*NL*
for
desiring
to
know
who
he
is
,
from
whence
he
came
,
and
whither
he
is
*NL*
going
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
he
comes
from
I
am
ignorant
;
but
I
can
readily
tell
you
where
he
*NL*
is
going
to
,
and
that
is
down
below
,
without
the
least
doubt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
only
speak
of
the
promise
you
wished
me
to
make
,
''
said
Franz
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
you
must
give
me
your
word
to
return
immediately
to
your
*NL*
hotel
,
and
make
no
attempt
to
follow
this
man
to-night
.
There
are
*NL*
certain
affinities
between
the
persons
we
quit
and
those
we
meet
*NL*
afterwards
.
For
heaven
's
sake
,
do
not
serve
as
a
conductor
between
that
*NL*
man
and
me
.
Pursue
your
chase
after
him
to-morrow
as
eagerly
as
you
*NL*
please
;
but
never
bring
him
near
me
,
if
you
would
not
see
me
die
of
*NL*
terror
.
And
now
,
good-night
;
go
to
your
rooms
,
and
try
to
sleep
away
all
*NL*
recollections
of
this
evening
.
For
my
own
part
,
I
am
quite
sure
I
shall
*NL*
not
be
able
to
close
my
eyes
.
''
So
saying
,
the
countess
quitted
Franz
,
*NL*
leaving
him
unable
to
decide
whether
she
were
merely
amusing
herself
at
*NL*
his
expense
,
or
whether
her
fears
and
agitations
were
genuine
.
*NL*
*NL*
Upon
his
return
to
the
hotel
,
Franz
found
Albert
in
his
dressing-gown
*NL*
and
slippers
,
listlessly
extended
on
a
sofa
,
smoking
a
cigar
.
``
My
dear
*NL*
fellow
.
''
cried
he
,
springing
up
,
``
is
it
really
you
?
Why
,
I
did
not
*NL*
expect
to
see
you
before
to-morrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Albert
,
''
replied
Franz
,
``
I
am
glad
of
this
opportunity
to
*NL*
tell
you
,
once
and
forever
,
that
you
entertain
a
most
erroneous
notion
*NL*
concerning
Italian
women
.
I
should
have
thought
the
continual
failures
*NL*
you
have
met
with
in
all
your
own
love
affairs
might
have
taught
you
*NL*
better
by
this
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Upon
my
soul
,
these
women
would
puzzle
the
very
Devil
to
read
them
*NL*
aright
.
Why
,
here
--
they
give
you
their
hand
--
they
press
yours
in
*NL*
return
--
they
keep
up
a
whispering
conversation
--
permit
you
to
accompany
*NL*
them
home
.
Why
,
if
a
Parisian
were
to
indulge
in
a
quarter
of
these
*NL*
marks
of
flattering
attention
,
her
reputation
would
be
gone
forever
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
the
very
reason
why
the
women
of
this
fine
country
put
so
little
*NL*
restraint
on
their
words
and
actions
,
is
because
they
live
so
much
*NL*
in
public
,
and
have
really
nothing
to
conceal
.
Besides
,
you
must
have
*NL*
perceived
that
the
countess
was
really
alarmed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
what
?
At
the
sight
of
that
respectable
gentleman
sitting
opposite
to
*NL*
us
in
the
same
box
with
the
lovely
Greek
girl
?
Now
,
for
my
part
,
I
met
*NL*
them
in
the
lobby
after
the
conclusion
of
the
piece
;
and
hang
me
,
if
*NL*
I
can
guess
where
you
took
your
notions
of
the
other
world
from
.
I
*NL*
can
assure
you
that
this
hobgoblin
of
yours
is
a
deuced
fine-looking
*NL*
fellow
--
admirably
dressed
.
Indeed
,
I
feel
quite
sure
,
from
the
cut
of
*NL*
his
clothes
,
they
are
made
by
a
first-rate
Paris
tailor
--
probably
*NL*
Blin
or
Humann
.
He
was
rather
too
pale
,
certainly
;
but
then
,
you
know
,
*NL*
paleness
is
always
looked
upon
as
a
strong
proof
of
aristocratic
descent
*NL*
and
distinguished
breeding
.
''
Franz
smiled
;
for
he
well
remembered
that
*NL*
Albert
particularly
prided
himself
on
the
entire
absence
of
color
in
his
*NL*
own
complexion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
that
tends
to
confirm
my
own
ideas
,
''
said
Franz
,
``
that
the
*NL*
countess
's
suspicions
were
destitute
alike
of
sense
and
reason
.
Did
he
*NL*
speak
in
your
hearing
?
and
did
you
catch
any
of
his
words
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
;
but
they
were
uttered
in
the
Romaic
dialect
.
I
knew
that
from
*NL*
the
mixture
of
Greek
words
.
I
do
n't
know
whether
I
ever
told
you
that
*NL*
when
I
was
at
college
I
was
rather
--
rather
strong
in
Greek
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
spoke
the
Romaic
language
,
did
he
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
settles
it
,
''
murmured
Franz
.
''
'T
is
he
,
past
all
doubt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
,
nothing
.
But
tell
me
,
what
were
you
thinking
about
when
I
came
*NL*
in
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
was
arranging
a
little
surprise
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
.
Of
what
nature
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
you
know
it
is
quite
impossible
to
procure
a
carriage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
;
and
I
also
know
that
we
have
done
all
that
human
means
*NL*
afforded
to
endeavor
to
get
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
then
,
in
this
difficulty
a
bright
idea
has
flashed
across
my
*NL*
brain
.
''
Franz
looked
at
Albert
as
though
he
had
not
much
confidence
in
*NL*
the
suggestions
of
his
imagination
.
``
I
tell
you
what
,
Sir
Franz
,
''
*NL*
cried
Albert
,
``
you
deserve
to
be
called
out
for
such
a
misgiving
and
*NL*
incredulous
glance
as
that
you
were
pleased
to
bestow
on
me
just
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
promise
to
give
you
the
satisfaction
of
a
gentleman
if
your
*NL*
scheme
turns
out
as
ingenious
as
you
assert
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
hearken
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
listen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
agree
,
do
you
not
,
that
obtaining
a
carriage
is
out
of
the
*NL*
question
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Neither
can
we
procure
horses
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
True
;
we
have
offered
any
sum
,
but
have
failed

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
now
,
what
do
you
say
to
a
cart
?
I
dare
say
such
a
thing
might
be
*NL*
had
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
possibly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
a
pair
of
oxen
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
easily
found

the
cart

*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
see
,
my
good
fellow
,
with
a
cart
and
a
couple
of
oxen
our
*NL*
business
can
be
managed
.
The
cart
must
be
tastefully
ornamented
;
and
*NL*
if
you
and
I
dress
ourselves
as
Neapolitan
reapers
,
we
may
get
up
a
*NL*
striking
tableau
,
after
the
manner
of
that
splendid
picture
by
Leopold
*NL*
Robert
.
It
would
add
greatly
to
the
effect
if
the
countess
would
join
*NL*
us
in
the
costume
of
a
peasant
from
Puzzoli
or
Sorrento
.
Our
group
*NL*
would
then
be
quite
complete

more
especially
as
the
countess
is
quite
*NL*
beautiful
enough
to
represent
a
madonna

*NL*
``
Well

national
one

replied
Albert
with
gratified
pride

*NL*
``
A

masque
borrowed
from

unhappy

trot
at

so
many
lazzaroni

assured

One
thing
I
was
sorry

bade
him
have
the
horns
of
the
oxen
gilded
,
he
told
me
there
*NL*
would
not
be

as
it
would
require
three
days
to
do
that
;
so
you
see

we
must
do
without

little
superfluity

And
where

At

the

opened

the

``
I
should
think
we

Albert
,
``
that
*NL*
if
this
person
merited
the
high
panegyrics
of
our
landlord
,
he
would
*NL*
have
conveyed
his
invitation
through
another
channel
,
and
not
permitted
*NL*
it
to
be
brought
to
us
in
this
unceremonious
way
.
He
would
have
*NL*
written

*NL*
*NL*
At
this
instant
some
one
knocked
at
the
door
.
``
Come
in

''
said
Franz
.
A
*NL*
servant
,
wearing
a
livery
of
considerable
style
and
richness
,
appeared
*NL*
at
the
threshold
,
and
,
placing
two
cards
in
the
landlord
's
hands
,
who
*NL*
forthwith
presented
them
to
the
two
young
men
,
he
said
,
``
Please
to
*NL*
deliver
these

from
the
Count
of
Monte
Cristo
to
Viscomte
Albert
de
*NL*
Morcerf
and
M.
Franz
d'Epinay
.
The
Count
of
Monte
Cristo
,
''
continued
the
*NL*
servant
,
``
begs
these
gentlemen
's
permission
to
wait
upon
them
as
their
*NL*
neighbor
,
and
he
will
be
honored
by
an
intimation
of
what
time
they
will
*NL*
please
to
receive
him

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Faith
,
Franz
,
''
whispered
Albert
,
``
there
is
not
much
to
find
fault
with
*NL*
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
the
count
,
''
replied
Franz
,
``
that
we
will
do
ourselves
the
pleasure
*NL*
of
calling
on
him
.
''
The
servant
bowed
and
retired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
what
I
call
an
elegant
mode
of
attack
,
''
said
Albert
,
``
You
were
*NL*
quite
correct
in
what
you
said
,
Signor
Pastrini
.
The
Count
of
Monte
*NL*
Cristo
is
unquestionably
a
man
of
first-rate
breeding
and
knowledge
of
*NL*
the
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
accept
his
offer
?
''
said
the
host
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
we
do
,
''
replied
Albert
.
``
Still
,
I
must
own
I
am
sorry
to
*NL*
be
obliged
to
give
up
the
cart
and
the
group
of
reapers
--
it
would
have
*NL*
produced
such
an
effect
!
And
were
it
not
for
the
windows
at
the
Palazzo
*NL*
Rospoli
,
by
way
of
recompense
for
the
loss
of
our
beautiful
scheme
,
I
*NL*
do
n't
know
but
what
I
should
have
held
on
by
my
original
plan
.
What
say
*NL*
you
,
Franz
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
agree
with
you
;
the
windows
in
the
Palazzo
Rospoli
alone
decided
*NL*
me
.
''
The
truth
was
,
that
the
mention
of
two
places
in
the
Palazzo
*NL*
Rospoli
had
recalled
to
Franz
the
conversation
he
had
overheard
the
*NL*
preceding
evening
in
the
ruins
of
the
Colosseum
between
the
mysterious
*NL*
unknown
and
the
Transteverin
,
in
which
the
stranger
in
the
cloak
had
*NL*
undertaken
to
obtain
the
freedom
of
a
condemned
criminal
;
and
if
this
*NL*
muffled-up
individual
proved
-LRB-
as
Franz
felt
sure
he
would
-RRB-
the
same
as
*NL*
the
person
he
had
just
seen
in
the
Teatro
Argentino
,
then
he
should
be
*NL*
able
to
establish
his
identity
,
and
also
to
prosecute
his
researches
*NL*
respecting
him
with
perfect
facility
and
freedom
.
Franz
passed
the
night
*NL*
in
confused
dreams
respecting
the
two
meetings
he
had
already
had
with
*NL*
his
mysterious
tormentor
,
and
in
waking
speculations
as
to
what
the
*NL*
morrow
would
produce
.
The
next
day
must
clear
up
every
doubt
;
and
*NL*
unless
his
near
neighbor
and
would-be
friend
,
the
Count
of
Monte
Cristo
,
*NL*
possessed
the
ring
of
Gyges
,
and
by
its
power
was
able
to
render
himself
*NL*
invisible
,
it
was
very
certain
he
could
not
escape
this
time
.
Eight
*NL*
o'clock
found
Franz
up
and
dressed
,
while
Albert
,
who
had
not
the
same
*NL*
motives
for
early
rising
,
was
still
soundly
asleep
.
The
first
act
*NL*
of
Franz
was
to
summon
his
landlord
,
who
presented
himself
with
his
*NL*
accustomed
obsequiousness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pray
,
Signor
Pastrini
,
''
asked
Franz
,
``
is
not
some
execution
appointed
*NL*
to
take
place
to-day
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
your
excellency
;
but
if
your
reason
for
inquiry
is
that
you
may
*NL*
procure
a
window
to
view
it
from
,
you
are
much
too
late
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
''
answered
Franz
,
``
I
had
no
such
intention
;
and
even
if
I
had
*NL*
felt
a
wish
to
witness
the
spectacle
,
I
might
have
done
so
from
Monte
*NL*
Pincio
--
could
I
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
exclaimed
mine
host
,
``
I
did
not
think
it
likely
your
excellency
*NL*
would
have
chosen
to
mingle
with
such
a
rabble
as
are
always
collected
*NL*
on
that
hill
,
which
,
indeed
,
they
consider
as
exclusively
belonging
to
*NL*
themselves
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
possibly
I
may
not
go
,
''
answered
Franz
;
``
but
in
case
I
feel
*NL*
disposed
,
give
me
some
particulars
of
to-day
's
executions
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
particulars
would
your
excellency
like
to
hear
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
the
number
of
persons
condemned
to
suffer
,
their
names
,
and
*NL*
description
of
the
death
they
are
to
die
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
happens
just
lucky
,
your
excellency
!
Only
a
few
minutes
ago
they
*NL*
brought
me
the
tavolettas
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
they
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sort
of
wooden
tablets
hung
up
at
the
corners
of
streets
the
evening
*NL*
before
an
execution
,
on
which
is
pasted
up
a
paper
containing
the
names
*NL*
of
the
condemned
persons
,
their
crimes
,
and
mode
of
punishment
.
The
*NL*
reason
for
so
publicly
announcing
all
this
is
,
that
all
good
and
*NL*
faithful
Catholics
may
offer
up
their
prayers
for
the
unfortunate
*NL*
culprits
,
and
,
above
all

beseech
of
heaven
to
grant
them
a
sincere

repentance

*NL*
``
And
these
tablets
are
brought
to
you
that
you
may
add
your
prayers
to
*NL*
those
of
the
faithful

they
?
''
asked
Franz
somewhat
incredulously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
dear
,
no
,
your
excellency
!
I
have
not
time
for
anybody
's
affairs
*NL*
but
my
own
and
those
of
my
honorable
guests
;
but
I
make
an
agreement
*NL*
with
the
man
who
pastes
up
the
papers
,
and
he
brings
them
to
me
as
he
*NL*
would
the
playbills
,
that
in
case
any
person
staying
at
my
hotel
should
*NL*
like
to
witness
an
execution

he
may
obtain
every
requisite
information

concerning
the
time

*NL*
``
Upon
my

that
is
a
most
delicate
attention

cried
Franz
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

returned
the
landlord
,
chuckling
and
rubbing
his
*NL*
hands
with
infinite
complacency
,
``
I
think
I
may
take
upon
myself
to

say

noble

striking
a
proof

Meanwhile

by
a
sight

*NL*
``
Nothing

be
easier
than
to
comply

said
*NL*
the
landlord

opening
the
door
of
the
chamber
;
``
I
have
caused
one

be

placed
on

Then
,
taking
the
tablet
*NL*
from
the
wall
,
he
handed
it
to
Franz
,
who
read
as
follows
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
The
public
is
informed
that
on
Wednesday
,
February
23d
,
being
the
*NL*
first
day
of
the
Carnival
,
executions
will
take
place
in
the
Piazza
*NL*
del
Popolo
,
by
order
of
the
Tribunal
of
the
Rota
,
of
two
persons
,
named
*NL*
Andrea
Rondola
,
and
Peppino
,
otherwise
called
Rocca
Priori
;
the
former
*NL*
found
guilty
of
the
murder
of
a
venerable
and
exemplary
priest
,
named
*NL*
Don
Cesare
Torlini
,
canon
of
the
church
of
St.
John
Lateran
;
and
the
*NL*
latter
convicted
of
being
an
accomplice
of
the
atrocious
and
sanguinary
*NL*
bandit
,
Luigi
Vampa
,
and
his
band
.
The
first-named
malefactor
will
be
*NL*
subjected
to
the
mazzuola
,
the
second
culprit
beheaded
.
The
prayers
of
*NL*
all
good
Christians
are
entreated
for
these
unfortunate
men
,
that
it
may
*NL*
please
God
to
awaken
them
to
a
sense
of
their
guilt
,
and
to
grant
them
a
*NL*
hearty
and
sincere
repentance
for
their
crimes
.

''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
precisely
what
Franz
had
heard
the
evening
before
in
the
ruins
*NL*
of
the
Colosseum
.
No
part
of
the
programme
differed
,
--
the
names
of
the
*NL*
condemned
persons
,
their
crimes
,
and
mode
of
punishment
,
all
agreed
*NL*
with
his
previous
information
.
In
all
probability
,
therefore
,
the
*NL*
Transteverin
was
no
other
than
the
bandit
Luigi
Vampa
himself
,
and
the
*NL*
man
shrouded
in
the
mantle
the
same
he
had
known
as
``
Sinbad
the
Sailor
,
''
*NL*
but
who
,
no
doubt
,
was
still
pursuing
his
philanthropic
expedition
*NL*
in
Rome
,
as
he
had
already
done
at
Porto-Vecchio
and
Tunis
.
Time
was
*NL*
getting
on
,
however
,
and
Franz
deemed
it
advisable
to
awaken
Albert
;
but
*NL*
at
the
moment
he
prepared
to
proceed
to
his
chamber
,
his
friend
entered
*NL*
the
room
in
perfect
costume
for
the
day
.
The
anticipated
delights
of
*NL*
the
Carnival
had
so
run
in
his
head
as
to
make
him
leave
his
pillow
long
*NL*
before
his
usual
hour
.
``
Now
,
my
excellent
Signor
Pastrini
,
''
said
Franz
,
*NL*
addressing
his
landlord
,
``
since
we
are
both
ready
,
do
you
think
we
may
*NL*
proceed
at
once
to
visit
the
Count
of
Monte
Cristo
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Most
assuredly
,
''
replied
he
.
``
The
Count
of
Monte
Cristo
is
always
an
*NL*
early
riser
;
and
I
can
answer
for
his
having
been
up
these
two
hours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
really
consider
we
shall
not
be
intruding
if
we
pay
our
*NL*
respects
to
him
directly
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
am
quite
sure
.
I
will
take
all
the
blame
on
myself
if
you
find
I
*NL*
have
led
you
into
an
error
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
if
it
be
so
,
are
you
ready
,
Albert
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perfectly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
go
and
return
our
best
thanks
for
his
courtesy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
let
us
do
so
.
''
The
landlord
preceded
the
friends
across
the
*NL*
landing
,
which
was
all
that
separated
them
from
the
apartments
of
the
*NL*
count
,
rang
at
the
bell
,
and
,
upon
the
door
being
opened
by
a
servant
,
*NL*
said
,
``
I
signori
Francesi
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
domestic
bowed
respectfully
,
and
invited
them
to
enter
.
They
passed
*NL*
through
two
rooms
,
furnished
in
a
luxurious
manner
they
had
not
expected
*NL*
to
see
under
the
roof
of
Signor
Pastrini
,
and
were
shown
into
an
*NL*
elegantly
fitted-up
drawing-room
.
The
richest
Turkey
carpets
covered
*NL*
the
floor
,
and
the
softest
and
most
inviting
couches
,
easy-chairs
,
and
*NL*
sofas
,
offered
their
high-piled
and
yielding
cushions
to
such
as
desired
*NL*
repose
or
refreshment
.
Splendid
paintings
by
the
first
masters
were
*NL*
ranged
against
the
walls
,
intermingled
with
magnificent
trophies
of
*NL*
war
,
while
heavy
curtains
of
costly
tapestry
were
suspended
before
the
*NL*
different
doors
of
the
room
.
``
If
your
excellencies
will
please
to
be
*NL*
seated
,
''
said
the
man
,
``
I
will
let
the
count
know
that
you
are
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
with
these
words
he
disappeared
behind
one
of
the
tapestried
*NL*
portieres
.
As
the
door
opened
,
the
sound
of
a
guzla
reached
the
ears
of
*NL*
the
young
men
,
but
was
almost
immediately
lost
,
for
the
rapid
closing
*NL*
of
the
door
merely
allowed
one
rich
swell
of
harmony
to
enter
.
Franz
*NL*
and
Albert
looked
inquiringly
at
each
other
,
then
at
the
gorgeous
*NL*
furnishings
of
the
apartment
.
Everything
seemed
more
magnificent
at
a
*NL*
second
view
than
it
had
done
at
their
first
rapid
survey
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Franz
to
his
friend
,
``
what
think
you
of
all
this
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
upon
my
soul
,
my
dear
fellow
,
it
strikes
me
that
our
elegant
and
*NL*
attentive
neighbor
must
either
be
some
successful
stock-jobber
who
has
*NL*
speculated
in
the
fall
of
the
Spanish
funds
,
or
some
prince
travelling
*NL*
incog
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hush
,
hush
!
''
replied
Franz
;
``
we
shall
ascertain
who
and
what
he
is
--
he
*NL*
comes
!
''
As
Franz
spoke
,
he
heard
the
sound
of
a
door
turning
on
its
*NL*
hinges
,
and
almost
immediately
afterwards
the
tapestry
was
drawn
aside
,
*NL*
and
the
owner
of
all
these
riches
stood
before
the
two
young
men
.
Albert
*NL*
instantly
rose
to
meet
him
,
but
Franz
remained
,
in
a
manner
,
spellbound
*NL*
on
his
chair
;
for
in
the
person
of
him
who
had
just
entered
he
*NL*
recognized
not
only
the
mysterious
visitant
to
the
Colosseum
,
and
the
*NL*
occupant
of
the
box
at
the
Teatro
Argentino
,
but
also
his
extraordinary
*NL*
host
of
Monte
Cristo

``
Gentlemen

said
the
Count
of

as
he
entered
,
``
I
pray
you

excuse
me

suffering
my
visit

feared

you
by
presenting
myself
earlier

you
sent

Albert

extricated

point
of
inventing
a
very
fantastic
vehicle
when
your
friendly
*NL*
invitation
reached
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
''
returned
the
count
,
motioning
the
two
young
men
to
sit
down
.
*NL*
``
It
was
the
fault
of
that
blockhead
Pastrini
,
that
I
did
not
sooner
*NL*
assist
you
in
your
distress
.
He
did
not
mention
a
syllable
of
your
*NL*
embarrassment
to
me
,
when
he
knows
that
,
alone
and
isolated
as
I
am
,
I
*NL*
seek
every
opportunity
of
making
the
acquaintance
of
my
neighbors
.
As
*NL*
soon
as
I
learned
I
could
in
any
way
assist
you
,
I
most
eagerly
seized
*NL*
the
opportunity
of
offering
my
services
.
''
The
two
young
men
bowed
.
Franz
*NL*
had
,
as
yet
,
found
nothing
to
say
;
he
had
come
to
no
determination
,
*NL*
and
as
nothing
in
the
count
's
manner
manifested
the
wish
that
he
should
*NL*
recognize
him
,
he
did
not
know
whether
to
make
any
allusion
to
the
past
,
*NL*
or
wait
until
he
had
more
proof
;
besides
,
although
sure
it
was
he
*NL*
who
had
been
in
the
box
the
previous
evening
,
he
could
not
be
equally
*NL*
positive
that
this
was
the
man
he
had
seen
at
the
Colosseum
.
He
*NL*
resolved
,
therefore
,
to
let
things
take
their
course
without
making
any
*NL*
direct
overture
to
the
count
.
Moreover
,
he
had
this
advantage
,
he
was
*NL*
master
of
the
count
's
secret
,
while
the
count
had
no
hold
on
Franz
,
who
*NL*
had
nothing
to
conceal
.
However
,
he
resolved
to
lead
the
conversation
to
*NL*
a
subject
which
might
possibly
clear
up
his
doubts
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Count
,
''
said
he
,
``
you
have
offered
us
places
in
your
carriage
,
and
at
*NL*
your
windows
in
the
Rospoli
Palace
.
Can
you
tell
us
where
we
can
obtain
*NL*
a
sight
of
the
Piazza
del
Popolo
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
said
the
count
negligently
,
looking
attentively
at
Morcerf
,
``
is
*NL*
there
not
something
like
an
execution
upon
the
Piazza
del
Popolo
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
returned
Franz
,
finding
that
the
count
was
coming
to
the
point
he
*NL*
wished
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stay
,
I
think
I
told
my
steward
yesterday
to
attend
to
this
;
perhaps
I
*NL*
can
render
you
this
slight
service
also
.
''
He
extended
his
hand
,
and
rang
*NL*
the
bell
thrice
.
``
Did
you
ever
occupy
yourself
,
''
said
he
to
Franz
,
``
with
*NL*
the
employment
of
time
and
the
means
of
simplifying
the
summoning
your
*NL*
servants

I
have

When
I
ring
once
,
it
is
for
my
valet
;
twice
,
for
my
*NL*
majordomo
;
thrice
,
for
my
steward
,
--
thus
I
do
not
waste
a
minute
or
a
*NL*
word
.
Here
he
is
.
''
A
man
of
about
forty-five
or
fifty
entered
,
exactly
*NL*
resembling
the
smuggler
who
had
introduced
Franz
into
the
cavern
;
but
*NL*
he
did
not
appear
to
recognize
him
.
It
was
evident
he
had
his
orders
.
*NL*
``
Monsieur
Bertuccio
,
''
said
the
count
,
``
you
have
procured
me
windows
*NL*
looking
on
the
Piazza
del
Popolo
,
as
I
ordered
you
yesterday
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

excellency

''
returned
the
steward
;
``
but
it
was
very
late
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
I
not
tell
you
I
wished
for
one
?

replied
the
count
,
frowning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
your
excellency
has
one
,
which
was
let
to
Prince
Lobanieff
;
but
I
*NL*
was
obliged
to
pay
a
hundred

--
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
will
do
--
that
will
do

Monsieur
Bertuccio

these
gentlemen
*NL*
all
such
domestic
arrangements

You
have
the
window
,
that
is
sufficient

*NL*
Give
orders
to
the
coachman
;
and
be
in
readiness
on
the
stairs
to
*NL*
conduct
us
to
it

The
steward
bowed
,
and
was
about
to
quit
the
room
.
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
continued
the
count
,
``
be
good
enough
to
ask
Pastrini
if
he
*NL*
has
received
the
tavoletta
,
and
if
he
can
send
us
an
account
of
the
*NL*
execution
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
no
need
to
do
that
,
''
said
Franz
,
taking
out
his
tablets
;
``
for
*NL*
I
saw
the
account

and
copied
it
down
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well

you
can
retire

M.
Bertuccio

let
us
know
when
breakfast

These
gentlemen

added
he
,
turning
to
the
two
friends
,
``

I
trust

me
the

*NL*
*NL*
``
But

Albert
,
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
Not

both

M.
*NL*
Bertuccio
,
lay
covers
for
three

He
then
took
Franz
's
tablets
out
of
*NL*
his
hand
.
''
`
We
announce

he
read

in
the

tone
with
which
he

would
have
read
a
newspaper

the
23d
of

executed
Andrea

guilty
of
murder

the
respected
*NL*
and
venerated
Don
Cesare
Torlini
,
canon
of
the
church
of
St.
John
*NL*
Lateran
,
and
Peppino

called

convicted
of
complicity
with

the
detestable
bandit
Luigi
Vampa

the
men
of
his
band

'
Hum
!

The
*NL*
first
will
be
mazzolato

the
second
decapitato

Yes
,
''
continued
*NL*
the
count
,
``
it
was
at
first
arranged
in
this
way
;
but
I
think
since
*NL*
yesterday
some
change
has
taken
place
in
the
order
of
the
ceremony
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
?
''
said
Franz
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
passed
the
evening
at
the
Cardinal
Rospigliosi
's
,
and
there
*NL*
mention
was
made
of
something
like
a
pardon
for
one
of
the
two
men
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
Andrea
Rondolo
?
''
asked
Franz
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
replied
the
count
,
carelessly
;
``
for
the
other
-LRB-
he
glanced
at
the
*NL*
tablets
as
if
to
recall
the
name
-RRB-
,
for
Peppino
,
called
Rocca
Priori
.
You
*NL*
are
thus
deprived
of
seeing
a
man
guillotined
;
but
the
mazzuola
still
*NL*
remains
,
which
is
a
very
curious
punishment
when
seen
for
the
first
*NL*
time
,
and
even
the
second
,
while
the
other
,
as
you
must
know
,
is
very
*NL*
simple

The
mandaia

-RSB-
never
fails

never
trembles

never
strikes
thirty

ineffectually

the
Count

to
whose
tender
mercy
Richelieu
had
doubtless
recommended
the

added
the
count

in
a
contemptuous
tone
,
``
do
not

*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
,
at

,
few
that
I
have
not
seen

''
said
the
count
coldly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
took
pleasure
in
beholding
these
dreadful
spectacles
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
first
sentiment
was
horror
,
the
second
indifference
,
the
third
*NL*
curiosity

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Curiosity

that
is
a
terrible
word

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
so
?
In
life
,
our
greatest
preoccupation
is
death
;
is
it
not
then
,
*NL*
curious
to
study
the
different
ways
by
which
the
soul

body
can
part
;

and
how

according
to
their
different
characters

temperaments

and
even
*NL*
the
different
customs
of
their
countries
,
different
persons
bear
the
*NL*
transition
from
life
to
death

from
existence
to
annihilation

As
for

myself

I
can
assure
you
of
one
thing
,
--
the
more
men
you
see
die
,
the
*NL*
easier
it
becomes
to
die
yourself
;
and
in
my
opinion
,
death
may
be
a
*NL*
torture
,

it
is
not
an
expiation

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
quite

you

replied
Franz
;
``
pray
explain

my
curiosity
to

*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen

said
the

,
and
deep
hatred
mounted
to
his
face
,
as
the
*NL*
blood
would
to
the
face
of
any
other

``
If
a

unheard-of

never
closes

in
your

do
you
think
the
reparation
that

society
gives
you
is
sufficient
when
it
interposes
the
knife
of
the
*NL*
guillotine
between
the
base
of
the
occiput

the
trapezal
muscles
of
*NL*
the
murderer

allows
him
who

years

moral
sufferings

to
escape
with
a
few
moments
of
physical
pain

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

I
know

said
Franz

that
human
justice

insufficient

console
us

she
can
give

put
another

the

that
where

are
there
not

made

cognizance

them

offering
him

even
the
insufficient
means

*NL*
``
Yes

*NL*

your

seduced

dishonored
your

happiness
God
has
promised

moreover

Then
you

asked

Albert
in

astonished
at
this
strange

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

yes

``
understand
me

I
would
fight

the
more
so
that

thanks
to
*NL*
my
skill
in
all
bodily
exercises

the
indifference

I
should
be
almost
certain

in

a
slow

profound

eternal
torture

I
would
give

were
it
possible

an
eye
*NL*
for
an
eye

a

for

the
Orientalists
say

our
masters

in
everything

dreams

*NL*
*NL*
``
But

said
Franz
to
the
count

``
with
this
theory

which
renders
you
at
*NL*
once
judge
and
executioner
of

own
cause

it
would
be
difficult
to
*NL*
adopt
a
course
that
would
forever
prevent
your
falling
under
the
power
*NL*
of
the
law
.
Hatred
is
blind
,
rage
carries
you
away
;
and
he
who
pours
out
*NL*
vengeance
runs
the
risk
of
tasting
a
bitter
draught

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

if
he
be
poor

inexperienced

not
if
he
be
rich

skilful

*NL*
besides
,
the
worst
that
could
happen
to
him
would
be
the
punishment
*NL*
of
which
we
have
already
spoken
,
and
which
the
philanthropic
French
*NL*
Revolution
has
substituted
for
being
torn

horses

broken

What
matters
this
punishment

as
long
as
he

avenged

On
*NL*
my
word

I
almost
regret
that

this
miserable
Peppino

will
not
be
beheaded

as
you
might
have
had
an
opportunity
then

*NL*
seeing
how
short
a
time
the
punishment
lasts
,
and
whether
it
is
worth
*NL*
even
mentioning

,
really
this
is
a
most
singular
conversation
for

the
Carnival

how
did
it
arise

Ah

I
recollect

you
asked

you
shall
have
it
;

let
us
first
sit
down

to
table

here
comes
the

inform
us

he
spoke
,
a
servant
opened
one
of
the
four
doors
of
the
*NL*
apartment
,
saying
--
``
Al
suo
commodo
!
''
The
two
young
men
arose
and
entered
*NL*
the
breakfast-room
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
meal
,
which
was
excellent
,
and
admirably
served
,
Franz
looked
*NL*
repeatedly
at
Albert
,
in
order
to
observe
the
impressions
which
he
*NL*
doubted
not
had
been
made
on
him
by
the
words
of
their
entertainer
;
but
*NL*
whether
with
his
usual
carelessness
he
had
paid
but
little
attention
to
*NL*
him
,
whether
the
explanation
of
the
Count
of
Monte
Cristo
with
regard
*NL*
to
duelling
had
satisfied
him
,
or
whether
the
events
which
Franz
knew
*NL*
of
had
had
their
effect
on
him
alone
,
he
remarked
that
his
companion
did
*NL*
not
pay
the
least
regard
to
them
,
but
on
the
contrary
ate
like
a
man
*NL*
who
for
the
last
four
or
five
months
had
been
condemned
to
partake
of
*NL*
Italian
cookery
--
that
is
,
the
worst
in
the
world
.
As
for
the
count
,
he
*NL*
just
touched
the
dishes
;
he
seemed
to
fulfil
the
duties
of
a
host
by
*NL*
sitting
down
with
his
guests
,
and
awaited
their
departure
to
be
served
*NL*
with
some
strange
or
more
delicate
food
.
This
brought
back
to
Franz
,
in
*NL*
spite
of
himself
,
the
recollection
of
the
terror
with
which
the
count
*NL*
had
inspired
the
Countess
G
--
,
and
her
firm
conviction
that
the
man
in
*NL*
the
opposite
box
was
a
vampire
.
At
the
end
of
the
breakfast
Franz
took
*NL*
out
his
watch
.
``
Well
,
''
said
the
count
,
``
what
are
you
doing
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
excuse
us
,
count
,
''
returned
Franz
,
``
but
we
have
still
much
to
*NL*
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
may
that
be
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
no
masks
,
and
it
is
absolutely
necessary
to
procure
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
not
concern
yourself
about
that
;
we
have
,
I
think
,
a
private
room
in
*NL*
the
Piazza
del
Popolo
;
I
will
have
whatever
costumes
you
choose
brought
*NL*
to
us
,
and
you
can
dress
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
After
the
execution
?
''
cried
Franz
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Before
or
after
,
whichever
you
please
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Opposite
the
scaffold
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
scaffold
forms
part
of
the
fete
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Count
,
I
have
reflected
on
the
matter
,
''
said
Franz
,
``
I
thank
you
for
*NL*
your
courtesy
,
but
I
shall
content
myself
with
accepting
a
place
in
your
*NL*
carriage
and
at
your
window
at
the
Rospoli
Palace
,
and
I
leave
you
at
*NL*
liberty
to
dispose
of
my
place
at
the
Piazza
del
Popolo
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
warn
you
,
you
will
lose
a
very
curious
sight
,
''
returned
the
*NL*
count
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
describe
it
to
me
,
''
replied
Franz
,
``
and
the
recital
from
your
*NL*
lips
will
make
as
great
an
impression
on
me
as
if
I
had
witnessed
it
.
I
*NL*
have
more
than
once
intended
witnessing
an
execution
,
but
I
have
never
*NL*
been
able
to
make
up
my
mind
;
and
you
,
Albert
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
,
''
replied
the
viscount
,
--
``
I
saw
Castaing
executed
,
but
I
think
I
was
*NL*
rather
intoxicated
that
day
,
for
I
had
quitted
college
the
same
morning
,
*NL*
and
we
had
passed
the
previous
night
at
a
tavern
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Besides
,
it
is
no
reason
because
you
have
not
seen
an
execution
at
*NL*
Paris
,
that
you
should
not
see
one
anywhere
else
;
when
you
travel
,
it
is
*NL*
to
see
everything
.
Think
what
a
figure
you
will
make
when
you
are
asked
,
*NL*
`
How
do
they
execute
at
Rome
?
'
and
you
reply
,
'
I
do
not
know
'
!
And
,
*NL*
besides
,
they
say
that
the
culprit
is
an
infamous
scoundrel
,
who
killed
*NL*
with
a
log
of
wood
a
worthy
canon
who
had
brought
him
up
like
his
own
*NL*
son
.
Diable
,
when
a
churchman
is
killed
,
it
should
be
with
a
different
*NL*
weapon
than
a
log
,
especially
when
he
has
behaved
like
a
father
.
If
you
*NL*
went
to
Spain
,
would
you
not
see
the
bull-fight
?
Well
,
suppose
it
is
*NL*
a
bull-fight
you
are
going
to
see
?
Recollect
the
ancient
Romans
of
*NL*
the
Circus
,
and
the
sports
where
they
killed
three
hundred
lions
and
*NL*
a
hundred
men
.
Think
of
the
eighty
thousand
applauding
spectators
,
the
*NL*
sage
matrons
who
took
their
daughters
,
and
the
charming
Vestals
who
made
*NL*
with
the
thumb
of
their
white
hands
the
fatal
sign
that
said
,
`
Come
,
*NL*
despatch
the
dying
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
you
go
,
then
,
Albert
?
''
asked
Franz
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ma
foi
,
yes
;
like
you
,
I
hesitated
,
but
the
count
's
eloquence
decides
*NL*
me

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
go
,
then
,
''
said
Franz
,
``
since
you
wish
it
;
but
on
our
way
to
the
*NL*
Piazza

I

through
the
Corso

Is
this
possible

*NL*
*NL*
``
On

yes

``
Is

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

something
I

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

will
go
by
the

send
the

to
wait
for
us

on
the
Piazza
del
Popolo
,
by
the
Strada
del
Babuino
,
for
I
shall
be
glad
*NL*

pass

myself
,
through
the
Corso

to
see
if
some
orders
I
have
given
*NL*
have
been
executed

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excellency
,
''
said
a
servant
,
opening
the
door
,
``
a
man
in
the
dress
of
a
*NL*
penitent
wishes
to
speak
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
yes
''
returned
the
count
,
``
I
know
who
he
is

gentlemen
;
will
you
*NL*
return
to
the
salon
?
you
will
find
good
cigars
on
the
centre
table
.
I
*NL*
will
be
with
you
directly
.
''
The
young
men
rose
and
returned
into
the
*NL*
salon
,
while
the
count
,
again
apologizing
,
left
by
another
door
.
Albert
,
*NL*
who
was
a
great
smoker
,
and
who
had
considered
it
no
small
sacrifice
to
*NL*
be
deprived
of
the
cigars
of
the
Cafe
de
Paris
,
approached
the
table
,
*NL*
and
uttered
a
cry
of
joy
at
perceiving
some
veritable
puros
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
asked
Franz
,
``
what
think
you
of
the
Count
of
Monte
Cristo
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
I
think
?
''
said
Albert
,
evidently
surprised
at
such
a
question
*NL*
from
his
companion
;
``
I
think
he
is
a
delightful
fellow
,
who
does
the
*NL*
honors
of
his
table
admirably
;
who
has
travelled
much
,
read
much
,
is
,
*NL*
like
Brutus
,
of
the
Stoic
school
,
and
moreover
,
''
added
he
,
sending
a
*NL*
volume
of
smoke
up
towards
the
ceiling
,
``
that
he
has
excellent
cigars
.
''
*NL*
Such
was
Albert
's
opinion
of
the
count
,
and
as
Franz
well
knew
that
*NL*
Albert
professed
never
to
form
an
opinion
except
upon
long
reflection
,
*NL*
he
made
no
attempt
to
change
it
.
``
But
,
''
said
he
,
``
did
you
observe
one
*NL*
very
singular
thing
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
attentively
he
looked
at
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
--
Albert
reflected
.
``
Ah
,
''
replied
he
,
sighing
,
``
that
is
not
very
*NL*
surprising
;
I
have
been
more
than
a
year
absent
from
Paris
,
and
*NL*
my
clothes
are
of
a
most
antiquated
cut
;
the
count
takes
me
for
a
*NL*
provincial
.
The
first
opportunity
you
have
,
undeceive
him
,
I
beg
,
and
*NL*
tell
him
I
am
nothing
of
the
kind
.
''
Franz
smiled
;
an
instant
after
the
*NL*
count
entered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
now
quite
at
your
service
,
gentlemen
,
''
said
he
.
``
The
carriage
is
*NL*
going
one
way
to
the
Piazza
del
Popolo
,
and
we
will
go
another
;
and
,
*NL*
if
you
please
,
by
the
Corso
.
Take
some
more
of
these
cigars
,
M.
de
*NL*
Morcerf
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
all
my
heart
,
''
returned
Albert
;
``
Italian
cigars
are
horrible
.
When
*NL*
you
come
to
Paris
,
I
will
return
all
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
not
refuse
;
I
intend
going
there
soon
,
and
since
you
allow
me
,
*NL*
I
will
pay
you
a
visit
.
Come
,
we
have
not
any
time
to
lose
,
it
is
*NL*
half-past
twelve
--
let
us
set
off
.
''
All
three
descended
;
the
coachman
*NL*
received
his
master
's
orders
,
and
drove
down
the
Via
del
Babuino
.
*NL*
While
the
three
gentlemen
walked
along
the
Piazza
de
Spagni
and
the
*NL*
Via
Frattina
,
which
led
directly
between
the
Fiano
and
Rospoli
palaces
,
*NL*
Franz
's
attention
was
directed
towards
the
windows
of
that
last
palace
,
*NL*
for
he
had
not
forgotten
the
signal
agreed
upon
between
the
man
in
the
*NL*
mantle
and
the
Transtevere
peasant
.
``
Which
are
your
windows
?
''
asked
he
*NL*
of
the
count
,
with
as
much
indifference
as
he
could
assume
.
``
The
three
*NL*
last
,
''
returned
he
,
with
a
negligence
evidently
unaffected
,
for
he
could
*NL*
not
imagine
with
what
intention
the
question
was
put
.
Franz
glanced
*NL*
rapidly
towards
the
three
windows
.
The
side
windows
were
hung
with
*NL*
yellow
damask
,
and
the
centre
one
with
white
damask
and
a
red
cross
.
The
*NL*
man
in
the
mantle
had
kept
his
promise
to
the
Transteverin
,
and
there
*NL*
could
now
be
no
doubt
that
he
was
the
count
.
The
three
windows
were
*NL*
still
untenanted
.
Preparations
were
making
on
every
side
;
chairs
were
*NL*
placed
,
scaffolds
were
raised
,
and
windows
were
hung
with
flags
.
The
*NL*
masks
could
not
appear
;
the
carriages
could
not
move
about
;
but
the
*NL*
masks
were
visible
behind
the
windows
,
the
carriages
,
and
the
doors
.
*NL*
*NL*
Franz
,
Albert
,
and
the
count
continued
to
descend
the
Corso
.
As
they
*NL*
approached
the
Piazza
del
Popolo
,
the
crowd
became
more
dense
,
and
*NL*
above
the
heads
of
the
multitude
two
objects
were
visible
:
the
obelisk
,
*NL*
surmounted
by
a
cross
,
which
marks
the
centre
of
the
square
,
and
in
*NL*
front
of
the
obelisk
,
at
the
point
where
the
three
streets
,
del
Babuino
,
*NL*
del
Corso
,
and
di
Ripetta
,
meet
,
the
two
uprights
of
the
scaffold
,
*NL*
between
which
glittered
the
curved
knife
of
the
mandaia
.
At
the
corner
*NL*
of
the
street
they
met
the
count
's
steward
,
who
was
awaiting
his
master
.
*NL*
The
window
,
let
at
an
exorbitant
price
,
which
the
count
had
doubtless
*NL*
wished
to
conceal
from
his
guests
,
was
on
the
second
floor
of
the
great
*NL*
palace
,
situated
between
the
Via
del
Babuino
and
the
Monte
Pincio
.
It
*NL*
consisted
,
as
we
have
said
,
of
a
small
dressing-room
,
opening
into
a
*NL*
bedroom
,
and
,
when
the
door
of
communication
was
shut
,
the
inmates
were
*NL*
quite
alone
.
On
chairs
were
laid
elegant
masquerade
costumes
of
blue
and
*NL*
white
satin
.
``
As
you
left
the
choice
of
your
costumes
to
me
,
''
said
the
*NL*
count
to
the
two
friends
,
``
I
have
had
these
brought
,
as
they
will
be
*NL*
the
most
worn
this
year
;
and
they
are
most
suitable
,
on
account
of
the
*NL*
confetti
-LRB-
sweetmeats
-RRB-
,
as
they
do
not
show
the
flour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Franz
heard
the
words
of
the
count
but
imperfectly
,
and
he
perhaps
did
*NL*
not
fully
appreciate
this
new
attention
to
their
wishes
;
for
he
was
*NL*
wholly
absorbed
by
the
spectacle
that
the
Piazza
del
Popolo
presented
,
*NL*
and
by
the
terrible
instrument
that
was
in
the
centre
.
It
was
the
first
*NL*
time
Franz
had
ever
seen
a
guillotine
,
--
we
say
guillotine
,
because
*NL*
the
Roman
mandaia
is
formed
on
almost
the
same
model
as
the
French
*NL*
instrument
.
-LSB-
*
-RSB-
The
knife
,
which
is
shaped
like
a
crescent
,
that
cuts
*NL*
with
the
convex
side
,
falls
from
a
less
height
,
and
that
is
all
the
*NL*
difference
.
Two
men
,
seated
on
the
movable
plank
on
which
the
victim
*NL*
is
laid
,
were
eating
their
breakfasts
,
while
waiting
for
the
criminal
.
*NL*
Their
repast
consisted
apparently
of
bread
and
sausages
.
One
of
them
*NL*
lifted
the
plank
,
took
out
a
flask
of
wine
,
drank
some
,
and
then
passed
*NL*
it
to
his
companion
.
These
two
men
were
the
executioner
's
assistants
.
*NL*
At
this
sight
Franz
felt
the
perspiration
start
forth
upon
his
brow
.
The
*NL*
prisoners
,
transported
the
previous
evening
from
the
Carcere
Nuovo
to
*NL*
the
little
church
of
Santa
Maria
del
Popolo
,
had
passed
the
night
,
each
*NL*
accompanied
by
two
priests
,
in
a
chapel
closed
by
a
grating
,
before
*NL*
which
were
two
sentinels
,
who
were
relieved
at
intervals
.
A
double
line
*NL*
of
carbineers
,
placed
on
each
side
of
the
door
of
the
church
,
reached
*NL*
to
the
scaffold
,
and
formed
a
circle
around
it
,
leaving
a
path
about
ten
*NL*
feet
wide
,
and
around
the
guillotine
a
space
of
nearly
a
hundred
feet
.
*NL*
All
the
rest
of
the
square
was
paved
with
heads
.
Many
women
held
their
*NL*
infants
on
their
shoulders
,
and
thus
the
children
had
the
best
view
.
*NL*
The
Monte
Pincio
seemed
a
vast
amphitheatre
filled
with
spectators
;
the
*NL*
balconies
of
the
two
churches
at
the
corner
of
the
Via
del
Babuino
and
*NL*
the
Via
di
Ripetta
were
crammed
;
the
steps
even
seemed
a
parti-colored
*NL*
sea
,
that
was
impelled
towards
the
portico
;
every
niche
in
the
wall
*NL*
held
its
living
statue
.
What
the
count
said
was
true
--
the
most
curious
*NL*
spectacle
in
life
is
that
of
death
.
And
yet
,
instead
of
the
silence
and
*NL*
the
solemnity
demanded
by
the
occasion
,
laughter
and
jests
arose
from
*NL*
the
crowd
.
It
was
evident
that
the
execution
was
,
in
the
eyes
of
the
*NL*
people
,
only
the
commencement
of
the
Carnival
.
Suddenly
the
tumult
*NL*
ceased
,
as
if
by
magic
,
and
the
doors
of
the
church
opened
.
A
*NL*
brotherhood
of
penitents
,
clothed
from
head
to
foot
in
robes
of
gray
*NL*
sackcloth
,
with
holes
for
the
eyes
,
and
holding
in
their
hands
lighted
*NL*
tapers
,
appeared
first
;
the
chief
marched
at
the
head
.
Behind
the
*NL*
penitents
came
a
man
of
vast
stature
and
proportions
.
He
was
naked
,
with
*NL*
the
exception
of
cloth
drawers
at
the
left
side
of
which
hung
a
large
*NL*
knife
in
a
sheath
,
and
he
bore
on
his
right
shoulder
a
heavy
iron
*NL*
sledge-hammer
.
This
man
was
the
executioner
.
He
had
,
moreover
,
sandals
*NL*
bound
on
his
feet
by
cords
.
Behind
the
executioner
came
,
in
the
order
*NL*
in
which
they
were
to
die
,
first
Peppino
and
then
Andrea
.
Each
was
*NL*
accompanied
by
two
priests
.
Neither
had
his
eyes
bandaged
.
Peppino
*NL*
walked
with
a
firm
step
,
doubtless
aware
of
what
awaited
him
.
Andrea
was
*NL*
supported
by
two
priests
.
Each
of
them
,
from
time
to
time
,
kissed
the
*NL*
crucifix
a
confessor
held
out
to
them
.
At
this
sight
alone
Franz
felt
*NL*
his
legs
tremble
under
him
.
He
looked
at
Albert
--
he
was
as
white
as
his
*NL*
shirt
,
and
mechanically
cast
away
his
cigar
,
although
he
had
not
half
*NL*
smoked
it
.
The
count
alone
seemed
unmoved
--
nay
,
more
,
a
slight
color
*NL*
seemed
striving
to
rise
in
his
pale
cheeks
.
His
nostrils
dilated
like
*NL*
those
of
a
wild
beast
that
scents
its
prey
,
and
his
lips
,
half
opened
,
*NL*
disclosed
his
white
teeth
,
small
and
sharp
like
those
of
a
jackal
.
And
*NL*
yet
his
features
wore
an
expression
of
smiling
tenderness
,
such
as
Franz
*NL*
had
never
before
witnessed
in
them
;
his
black
eyes
especially
were
full
*NL*
of
kindness
and
pity
.
However
,
the
two
culprits
advanced
,
and
as
they
*NL*
approached
their
faces
became
visible
.
Peppino
was
a
handsome
young
*NL*
man
of
four
or
five
and
twenty
,
bronzed
by
the
sun
;
he
carried
his
head
*NL*
erect
,
and
seemed
on
the
watch
to
see
on
which
side
his
liberator
*NL*
would
appear
.
Andrea
was
short
and
fat
;
his
visage
,
marked
with
brutal
*NL*
cruelty
,
did
not
indicate
age
;
he
might
be
thirty
.
In
prison
he
had
*NL*
suffered
his
beard
to
grow
;
his
head
fell
on
his
shoulder
,
his
legs
*NL*
bent
beneath
him
,
and
his
movements
were
apparently
automatic
and
*NL*
unconscious
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
Dr.
Guillotin
got
the
idea
of
his
famous
machine
from
*NL*
witnessing
an
execution
in
Italy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
,
''
said
Franz
to
the
count
,
``
that
you
told
me
there
would
be
*NL*
but
one
execution
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
told
you
true
,
''
replied
he
coldly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
yet
here
are
two
culprits
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
but
only
one
of
these
two
is
about
to
die
;
the
other
has
many
*NL*
years
to
live
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
the
pardon
is
to
come
,
there
is
no
time
to
lose
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
see
,
here
it
is
,
''
said
the
count
.
At
the
moment
when
Peppino
*NL*
reached
the
foot
of
the
mandaia
,
a
priest
arrived
in
some
haste
,
*NL*
forced
his
way
through
the
soldiers
,
and
,
advancing
to
the
chief
of
the
*NL*
brotherhood
,
gave
him
a
folded
paper
.
The
piercing
eye
of
Peppino
had
*NL*
noticed
all
.
The
chief
took
the
paper
,
unfolded
it
,
and
,
raising
his
*NL*
hand
,
``
Heaven
be
praised
,
and
his
holiness
also
,
''
said
he
in
a
loud
*NL*
voice
;
``
here
is
a
pardon
for
one
of
the
prisoners
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
pardon
!
''
cried
the
people
with
one
voice
--
``
a
pardon
!
''
At
this
cry
*NL*
Andrea
raised
his
head
.
``
Pardon
for
whom
?
''
cried
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
Peppino
remained
breathless
.
``
A
pardon
for
Peppino
,
called
Rocca
*NL*
Priori
,
''
said
the
principal
friar
.
And
he
passed
the
paper
to
the
*NL*
officer
commanding
the
carbineers
,
who
read
and
returned
it
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
Peppino
!
''
cried
Andrea
,
who
seemed
roused
from
the
torpor
in
*NL*
which
he
had
been
plunged
.
``
Why
for
him
and
not
for
me
?
We
ought
to
die
*NL*
together
.
I
was
promised
he
should
die
with
me
.
You
have
no
right
to
put
*NL*
me
to
death
alone
.
I
will
not
die
alone
--
I
will
not
!
''
And
he
broke
*NL*
from
the
priests
struggling
and
raving
like
a
wild
beast
,
and
striving
*NL*
desperately
to
break
the
cords
that
bound
his
hands
.
The
executioner
*NL*
made
a
sign
,
and
his
two
assistants
leaped
from
the
scaffold
and
seized
*NL*
him
.
``
What
is
going
on
?
''
asked
Franz
of
the
count
;
for
,
as
all
the
talk
*NL*
was
in
the
Roman
dialect
,
he
had
not
perfectly
understood
it
.
``
Do
you
*NL*
not
see
?
''
returned
the
count
,
``
that
this
human
creature
who
is
about
to
*NL*
die
is
furious
that
his
fellow-sufferer
does
not
perish
with
him
?
and
,
*NL*
were
he
able
,
he
would
rather
tear
him
to
pieces
with
his
teeth
and
*NL*
nails
than
let
him
enjoy
the
life
he
himself
is
about
to
be
deprived
*NL*
of
.
Oh
,
man
,
man
--
race
of
crocodiles
,
''
cried
the
count
,
extending
his
*NL*
clinched
hands
towards
the
crowd
,
``
how
well
do
I
recognize
you
there
,
*NL*
and
that
at
all
times
you
are
worthy
of
yourselves
!
''
Meanwhile
Andrea
*NL*
and
the
two
executioners
were
struggling
on
the
ground
,
and
he
kept
*NL*
exclaiming
,
``
He
ought
to
die
!
--
he
shall
die
!
--
I
will
not
die
alone
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
,
look
,
''
cried
the
count
,
seizing
the
young
men
's
hands
--
``
look
,
for
*NL*
on
my
soul
it
is
curious
.
Here
is
a
man
who
had
resigned
himself
to
his
*NL*
fate
,
who
was
going
to
the
scaffold
to
die
--
like
a
coward
,
it
is
true
,
*NL*
but
he
was
about
to
die
without
resistance
.
Do
you
know
what
gave
him
*NL*
strength
?
--
do
you
know
what
consoled
him
?
It
was
,
that
another
partook
*NL*
of
his
punishment
--
that
another
partook
of
his
anguish
--
that
another
*NL*
was
to
die
before
him
.
Lead
two
sheep
to
the
butcher
's
,
two
oxen
to
the
*NL*
slaughterhouse
,
and
make
one
of
them
understand
that
his
companion
will
*NL*
not
die
;
the
sheep
will
bleat
for
pleasure
,
the
ox
will
bellow
with
joy
.
*NL*
But
man
--
man
,
whom
God
created
in
his
own
image
--
man
,
upon
whom
God
has
*NL*
laid
his
first
,
his
sole
commandment
,
to
love
his
neighbor
--
man
,
to
whom
*NL*
God
has
given
a
voice
to
express
his
thoughts
--
what
is
his
first
cry
*NL*
when
he
hears
his
fellow-man
is
saved
?
A
blasphemy
.
Honor
to
man
,
this
*NL*
masterpiece
of
nature
,
this
king
of
the
creation
!
''
And
the
count
burst
*NL*
into
a
laugh
;
a
terrible
laugh
,
that
showed
he
must
have
suffered
*NL*
horribly
to
be
able
thus
to
laugh
.
However
,
the
struggle
still
*NL*
continued
,
and
it
was
dreadful
to
witness
.
The
people
all
took
part
*NL*
against
Andrea
,
and
twenty
thousand
voices
cried
,
``
Put
him
to
death
!
put
*NL*
him
to
death
!
''
Franz
sprang
back
,
but
the
count
seized
his
arm
,
and
held
*NL*
him
before
the
window
.
``
What
are
you
doing
?
''
said
he
.
``
Do
you
pity
him
?
*NL*
If
you
heard
the
cry
of
`
Mad
dog
!
'
you
would
take
your
gun
--
you
would
*NL*
unhesitatingly
shoot
the
poor
beast
,
who
,
after
all
,
was
only
guilty
of
*NL*
having
been
bitten
by
another
dog
.
And
yet
you
pity
a
man
who
,
without
*NL*
being
bitten
by
one
of
his
race
,
has
yet
murdered
his
benefactor
;
and
*NL*
who
,
now
unable
to
kill
any
one
,
because
his
hands
are
bound
,
wishes
to
*NL*
see
his
companion
in
captivity
perish
.
No
,
no
--
look
,
look
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
command
was
needless
.
Franz
was
fascinated
by
the
horrible
*NL*
spectacle
.
The
two
assistants
had
borne
Andrea
to
the
scaffold
,
and
*NL*
there
,
in
spite
of
his
struggles
,
his
bites
,
and
his
cries
,
had
forced
*NL*
him
to
his
knees
.
During
this
time
the
executioner
had
raised
his
mace
,
*NL*
and
signed
to
them
to
get
out
of
the
way
;
the
criminal
strove
to
rise
,
*NL*
but
,
ere
he
had
time
,
the
mace
fell
on
his
left
temple
.
A
dull
and
heavy
*NL*
sound
was
heard
,
and
the
man
dropped
like
an
ox
on
his
face
,
and
then
*NL*
turned
over
on
his
back
.
The
executioner
let
fall
his
mace
,
drew
his
*NL*
knife
,
and
with
one
stroke
opened
his
throat
,
and
mounting
on
his
*NL*
stomach
,
stamped
violently
on
it
with
his
feet
.
At
every
stroke
a
jet
of
*NL*
blood
sprang
from
the
wound
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
time
Franz
could
contain
himself
no
longer
,
but
sank
,
half
*NL*
fainting
,
into
a
seat
.
Albert
,
with
his
eyes
closed
,
was
standing
*NL*
grasping
the
window-curtains
.
The
count
was
erect
and
triumphant
,
like
*NL*
the
Avenging
Angel
!

Chapter
36
.
The
Carnival
at
Rome
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Franz
recovered
his
senses
,
he
saw
Albert
drinking
a
glass
of
*NL*
water
,
of
which
,
to
judge
from
his
pallor
,
he
stood
in
great
need
;
*NL*
and
the
count
,
who
was
assuming
his
masquerade
costume
.
He
glanced
*NL*
mechanically
towards
the
square
--
the
scene
was
wholly
changed
;
scaffold
,
*NL*
executioners
,
victims
,
all
had
disappeared
;
only
the
people
remained
,
*NL*
full
of
noise
and
excitement
.
The
bell
of
Monte
Citorio
,
which
only
*NL*
sounds
on
the
pope
's
decease
and
the
opening
of
the
Carnival
,
was
*NL*
ringing
a
joyous
peal
.
``
Well
,
''
asked
he
of
the
count
,
``
what
has
,
then
,
*NL*
happened
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
,
''
replied
the
count
;
``
only
,
as
you
see
,
the
Carnival
has
*NL*
commenced
.
Make
haste
and
dress
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
fact
,
''
said
Franz
,
``
this
horrible
scene
has
passed
away
like
a
*NL*
dream
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
but
a
dream
,
a
nightmare
,
that
has
disturbed
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
that
I
have
suffered
;
but
the
culprit
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
a
dream
also
;
only
he
has
remained
asleep
,
while
you
have
*NL*
awakened
;
and
who
knows
which
of
you
is
the
most
fortunate
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
Peppino
--
what
has
become
of
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Peppino
is
a
lad
of
sense
,
who
,
unlike
most
men
,
who
are
happy
in
*NL*
proportion
as
they
are
noticed
,
was
delighted
to
see
that
the
general
*NL*
attention
was
directed
towards
his
companion
.
He
profited
by
this
*NL*
distraction
to
slip
away
among
the
crowd
,
without
even
thanking
the
*NL*
worthy
priests
who
accompanied
him
.
Decidedly
man
is
an
ungrateful
and
*NL*
egotistical
animal
.
But
dress
yourself
;
see
,
M.
de
Morcerf
sets
you
*NL*
the
example
.
''
Albert
was
drawing
on
the
satin
pantaloon
over
his
black
*NL*
trousers
and
varnished
boots
.
``
Well
,
Albert
,
''
said
Franz
,
``
do
you
feel
*NL*
much
inclined
to
join
the
revels
?
Come
,
answer
frankly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ma
foi
,
no
,
''
returned
Albert
.
``
But
I
am
really
glad
to
have
seen
such
*NL*
a
sight
;
and
I
understand
what
the
count
said
--
that
when
you
have
once
*NL*
habituated
yourself
to
a
similar
spectacle
,
it
is
the
only
one
that
*NL*
causes
you
any
emotion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Without
reflecting
that
this
is
the
only
moment
in
which
you
can
study
*NL*
character
,
''
said
the
count
;
``
on
the
steps
of
the
scaffold
death
tears
*NL*
off
the
mask
that
has
been
worn
through
life
,
and
the
real
visage
is
*NL*
disclosed
.
It
must
be
allowed
that
Andrea
was
not
very
handsome
,
the
*NL*
hideous
scoundrel
!
Come
,
dress
yourselves
,
gentlemen
,
dress
yourselves
.
''
*NL*
Franz
felt
it
would
be
ridiculous
not
to
follow
his
two
companions
'
*NL*
example
.
He
assumed
his
costume
,
and
fastened
on
the
mask
that
scarcely
*NL*
equalled
the
pallor
of
his
own
face
.
Their
toilet
finished
,
they
*NL*
descended
;
the
carriage
awaited
them
at
the
door
,
filled
with
sweetmeats
*NL*
and
bouquets
.
They
fell
into
the
line
of
carriages
.
It
is
difficult
to
*NL*
form
an
idea
of
the
perfect
change
that
had
taken
place
.
Instead
of
the
*NL*
spectacle
of
gloomy
and
silent
death
,
the
Piazza
del
Popolo
presented
a
*NL*
spectacle
of
gay
and
noisy
mirth
and
revelry
.
A
crowd
of
masks
flowed
*NL*
in
from
all
sides
,
emerging
from
the
doors
,
descending
from
the
windows
.
*NL*
From
every
street
and
every
corner
drove
carriages
filled
with
clowns
,
*NL*
harlequins
,
dominoes
,
mummers
,
pantomimists
,
Transteverins
,
knights
,
and
*NL*
peasants
,
screaming
,
fighting
,
gesticulating
,
throwing
eggs
filled
with
*NL*
flour
,
confetti
,
nosegays
,
attacking
,
with
their
sarcasms
and
their
*NL*
missiles
,
friends
and
foes
,
companions
and
strangers
,
indiscriminately
,
*NL*
and
no
one
took
offence
,
or
did
anything
but
laugh
.
Franz
and
Albert
*NL*
were
like
men
who
,
to
drive
away
a
violent
sorrow
,
have
recourse
to
*NL*
wine
,
and
who
,
as
they
drink
and
become
intoxicated
,
feel
a
thick
veil
*NL*
drawn
between
the
past
and
the
present
.
They
saw
,
or
rather
continued
*NL*
to
see
,
the
image
of
what
they
had
witnessed
;
but
little
by
little
the
*NL*
general
vertigo
seized
them
,
and
they
felt
themselves
obliged
to
take
*NL*
part
in
the
noise
and
confusion
.
A
handful
of
confetti
that
came
from
*NL*
a
neighboring
carriage
,
and
which
,
while
it
covered
Morcerf
and
his
*NL*
two
companions
with
dust
,
pricked
his
neck
and
that
portion
of
his
face
*NL*
uncovered
by
his
mask
like
a
hundred
pins
,
incited
him
to
join
in
the
*NL*
general
combat
,
in
which
all
the
masks
around
him
were
engaged
.
He
rose
*NL*
in
his
turn
,
and
seizing
handfuls
of
confetti
and
sweetmeats
,
with
which
*NL*
the
carriage
was
filled
,
cast
them
with
all
the
force
and
skill
he
was
*NL*
master
of
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
strife
had
fairly
begun
,
and
the
recollection
of
what
they
had
seen
*NL*
half
an
hour
before
was
gradually
effaced
from
the
young
men
's
minds
,
*NL*
so
much
were
they
occupied
by
the
gay
and
glittering
procession
they
now
*NL*
beheld
.
As
for
the
Count
of
Monte
Cristo
,
he
had
never
for
an
instant
*NL*
shown
any
appearance
of
having
been
moved
.
Imagine
the
large
and
*NL*
splendid
Corso
,
bordered
from
one
end
to
the
other
with
lofty
palaces
,
*NL*
with
their
balconies
hung
with
carpets
,
and
their
windows
with
flags
.
At
*NL*
these
balconies
are
three
hundred
thousand
spectators
--
Romans
,
Italians
,
*NL*
strangers
from
all
parts
of
the
world
,
the
united
aristocracy
of
birth
,
*NL*
wealth
,
and
genius
.
Lovely
women
,
yielding
to
the
influence
of
the
*NL*
scene
,
bend
over
their
balconies
,
or
lean
from
their
windows
,
and
shower
*NL*
down
confetti
,
which
are
returned
by
bouquets
;
the
air
seems
darkened
*NL*
with
the
falling
confetti
and
flying
flowers
.
In
the
streets
the
lively
*NL*
crowd
is
dressed
in
the
most
fantastic
costumes
--
gigantic
cabbages
walk
*NL*
gravely
about
,
buffaloes
'
heads
bellow
from
men
's
shoulders
,
dogs
walk
*NL*
on
their
hind
legs
;
in
the
midst
of
all
this
a
mask
is
lifted
,
and
,
as
*NL*
in
Callot
's
Temptation
of
St.
Anthony
,
a
lovely
face
is
exhibited
,
*NL*
which
we
would
fain
follow
,
but
from
which
we
are
separated
by
troops
*NL*
of
fiends
.
This
will
give
a
faint
idea
of
the
Carnival
at
Rome
.
At
the
*NL*
second
turn
,
the
count
stopped
the
carriage
,
and
requested
permission
to
*NL*
withdraw
,
leaving
the
vehicle
at
their
disposal
.
Franz
looked
up
--
they
*NL*
were
opposite
the
Rospoli
Palace
.
At
the
centre
window
,
the
one
hung
*NL*
with
white
damask
with
a
red
cross
,
was
a
blue
domino
,
beneath
*NL*
which
Franz
's
imagination
easily
pictured
the
beautiful
Greek
of
the
*NL*
Argentina
.
``
Gentlemen
,
''
said
the
count
,
springing
out
,
``
when
you
are
*NL*
tired
of
being
actors
,
and
wish
to
become
spectators
of
this
scene
,
*NL*
you
know
you
have
places
at
my
windows
.
In
the
meantime
,
dispose
of
my
*NL*
coachman
,
my
carriage
,
and
my
servants
.
''
We
have
forgotten
to
mention
,
*NL*
that
the
count
's
coachman
was
attired
in
a
bear-skin
,
exactly
resembling
*NL*
Odry
's
in
``
The
Bear
and
the
Pasha
;
''
and
the
two
footmen
behind
were
*NL*
dressed
up
as
green
monkeys
,
with
spring
masks
,
with
which
they
made
*NL*
grimaces
at
every
one
who
passed
.
Franz
thanked
the
count
for
his
*NL*
attention
.
As
for
Albert
,
he
was
busily
occupied
throwing
bouquets
at
a
*NL*
carriage
full
of
Roman
peasants
that
was
passing
near
him
.
Unfortunately
*NL*
for
him
,
the
line
of
carriages
moved
on
again
,
and
while
he
descended
*NL*
the
Piazza
del
Popolo
,
the
other
ascended
towards
the
Palazzo
di
*NL*
Venezia
.
``
Ah
,
my
dear
fellow
,
''
said
he
to
Franz
;
``
you
did
not
see
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
--
that
calash
filled
with
Roman
peasants
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
am
convinced
they
are
all
charming
women
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
unfortunate
that
you
were
masked
,
Albert
,
''
said
Franz
;
``
here
was
an
*NL*
opportunity
of
making
up
for
past
disappointments
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
replied
he
,
half
laughing
,
half
serious
;
``
I
hope
the
Carnival
will
*NL*
not
pass
without
some
amends
in
one
shape
or
the
other
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
in
spite
of
Albert
's
hope
,
the
day
passed
unmarked
by
any
incident
,
*NL*
excepting
two
or
three
encounters
with
the
carriage
full
of
Roman
*NL*
peasants
.
At
one
of
these
encounters
,
accidentally
or
purposely
,
*NL*
Albert
's
mask
fell
off
.
He
instantly
rose
and
cast
the
remainder
of
the
*NL*
bouquets
into
the
carriage
.
Doubtless
one
of
the
charming
females
*NL*
Albert
had
detected
beneath
their
coquettish
disguise
was
touched
by
his
*NL*
gallantry
;
for
,
as
the
carriage
of
the
two
friends
passed
her
,
she
threw
*NL*
a
bunch
of
violets
.
Albert
seized
it
,
and
as
Franz
had
no
reason
to
*NL*
suppose
it
was
meant
for
him
,
he
suffered
Albert
to
retain
it
.
Albert
*NL*
placed
it
in
his
button-hole
,
and
the
carriage
went
triumphantly
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Franz
to
him
;
``
there
is
the
beginning
of
an
adventure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Laugh
if
you
please
--
I
really
think
so
.
So
I
will
not
abandon
this
*NL*
bouquet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pardieu
,
''
returned
Franz
,
laughing
,
``
in
token
of
your
ingratitude
.
''
*NL*
The
jest
,
however
,
soon
appeared
to
become
earnest
;
for
when
Albert
and
*NL*
Franz
again
encountered
the
carriage
with
the
contadini
,
the
one
who
had
*NL*
thrown
the
violets
to
Albert
,
clapped
her
hands
when
she
beheld
them
*NL*
in
his
button-hole
.
``
Bravo
,
bravo
,
''
said
Franz
;
``
things
go
wonderfully
.
*NL*
Shall
I
leave
you
?
Perhaps
you
would
prefer
being
alone
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
replied
he
;
``
I
will
not
be
caught
like
a
fool
at
a
first
*NL*
disclosure
by
a
rendezvous
under
the
clock
,
as
they
say
at
the
*NL*
opera-balls
.
If
the
fair
peasant
wishes
to
carry
matters
any
further
,
*NL*
we
shall
find
her
,
or
rather
,
she
will
find
us
to-morrow
;
then
she
will
*NL*
give
me
some
sign
or
other
,
and
I
shall
know
what
I
have
to
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
my
word
,
''
said
Franz
,
``
you
are
wise
as
Nestor
and
prudent
as
*NL*
Ulysses
,
and
your
fair
Circe
must
be
very
skilful
or
very
powerful
if
*NL*
she
succeed
in
changing
you
into
a
beast
of
any
kind
.
''
Albert
was
right
;
*NL*
the
fair
unknown
had
resolved
,
doubtless
,
to
carry
the
intrigue
no
*NL*
farther
;
for
although
the
young
men
made
several
more
turns
,
they
did
*NL*
not
again
see
the
calash
,
which
had
turned
up
one
of
the
neighboring
*NL*
streets
.
Then
they
returned
to
the
Rospoli
Palace
;
but
the
count
and
*NL*
the
blue
domino
had
also
disappeared
;
the
two
windows
,
hung
with
yellow
*NL*
damask
,
were
still
occupied
by
the
persons
whom
the
count
had
invited
.
*NL*
At
this
moment
the
same
bell
that
had
proclaimed
the
beginning
of
the
*NL*
mascherata
sounded
the
retreat
.
The
file
on
the
Corso
broke
the
line
,
*NL*
and
in
a
second
all
the
carriages
had
disappeared
.
Franz
and
Albert
were
*NL*
opposite
the
Via
delle
Maratte
;
the
coachman
,
without
saying
a
word
,
*NL*
drove
up
it
,
passed
along
the
Piazza
di
Spagni
and
the
Rospoli
Palace
*NL*
and
stopped
at
the
door
of
the
hotel
.
Signor
Pastrini
came
to
the
door
*NL*
to
receive
his
guests
.
Franz
hastened
to
inquire
after
the
count
,
and
to
*NL*
express
regret
that
he
had
not
returned
in
sufficient
time
;
but
Pastrini
*NL*
reassured
him
by
saying
that
the
Count
of
Monte
Cristo
had
ordered
a
*NL*
second
carriage
for
himself
,
and
that
it
had
gone
at
four
o'clock
to
*NL*
fetch
him
from
the
Rospoli
Palace
.
The
count
had
,
moreover
,
charged
*NL*
him
to
offer
the
two
friends
the
key
of
his
box
at
the
Argentina
.
Franz
*NL*
questioned
Albert
as
to
his
intentions
;
but
Albert
had
great
projects
*NL*
to
put
into
execution
before
going
to
the
theatre
;
and
instead
of
making
*NL*
any
answer
,
he
inquired
if
Signor
Pastrini
could
procure
him
a
tailor
.
*NL*
``
A
tailor
,
''
said
the
host
;
``
and
for
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
make
us
between
now
and
to-morrow
two
Roman
peasant
costumes
,
''
*NL*
returned
Albert
.
The
host
shook
his
head
.
``
To
make
you
two
costumes
*NL*
between
now
and
to-morrow
?
I
ask
your
excellencies
'
pardon
,
but
this
*NL*
is
quite
a
French
demand
;
for
the
next
week
you
will
not
find
a
single
*NL*
tailor
who
would
consent
to
sew
six
buttons
on
a
waistcoat
if
you
paid
*NL*
him
a
crown
a
piece
for
each
button
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
must
give
up
the
idea
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
we
have
them
ready-made
.
Leave
all
to
me
;
and
to-morrow
,
when
you
*NL*
awake
,
you
shall
find
a
collection
of
costumes
with
which
you
will
be
*NL*
satisfied
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Albert
,
''
said
Franz
,
``
leave
all
to
our
host
;
he
has
already
*NL*
proved
himself
full
of
resources
;
let
us
dine
quietly
,
and
afterwards
go
*NL*
and
see
`
The
Algerian
Captive
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Agreed
,
''
returned
Albert
;
``
but
remember
,
Signor
Pastrini
,
that
both
my
*NL*
friend
and
myself
attach
the
greatest
importance
to
having
to-morrow
the
*NL*
costumes
we
have
asked
for
.
''
The
host
again
assured
them
they
might
rely
*NL*
on
him
,
and
that
their
wishes
should
be
attended
to
;
upon
which
Franz
*NL*
and
Albert
mounted
to
their
apartments
,
and
proceeded
to
disencumber
*NL*
themselves
of
their
costumes
.
Albert
,
as
he
took
off
his
dress
,
*NL*
carefully
preserved
the
bunch
of
violets
;
it
was
his
token
reserved
*NL*
for
the
morrow
.
The
two
friends
sat
down
to
table
;
but
they
could
*NL*
not
refrain
from
remarking
the
difference
between
the
Count
of
Monte
*NL*
Cristo
's
table
and
that
of
Signor
Pastrini
.
Truth
compelled
Franz
,
in
*NL*
spite
of
the
dislike
he
seemed
to
have
taken
to
the
count
,
to
confess
*NL*
that
the
advantage
was
not
on
Pastrini
's
side
.
During
dessert
,
the
*NL*
servant
inquired
at
what
time
they
wished
for
the
carriage
.
Albert
*NL*
and
Franz
looked
at
each
other
,
fearing
really
to
abuse
the
count
's
*NL*
kindness
.
The
servant
understood
them
.
``
His
excellency
the
Count
of
*NL*
Monte
Cristo
had
,
''
he
said
,
``
given
positive
orders
that
the
carriage
was
*NL*
to
remain
at
their
lordships
'
orders
all
day
,
and
they
could
therefore
*NL*
dispose
of
it
without
fear
of
indiscretion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
resolved
to
profit
by
the
count
's
courtesy
,
and
ordered
the
horses
*NL*
to
be
harnessed
,
while
they
substituted
evening
dress
for
that
which
*NL*
they
had
on
,
and
which
was
somewhat
the
worse
for
the
numerous
combats
*NL*
they
had
sustained
.
This
precaution
taken
,
they
went
to
the
theatre
,
*NL*
and
installed
themselves
in
the
count
's
box
.
During
the
first
act
,
the
*NL*
Countess
G
--
entered
.
Her
first
look
was
at
the
box
where
she
had
seen
*NL*
the
count
the
previous
evening
,
so
that
she
perceived
Franz
and
Albert
*NL*
in
the
place
of
the
very
person
concerning
whom
she
had
expressed
so
*NL*
strange
an
opinion
to
Franz
.
Her
opera-glass
was
so
fixedly
directed
*NL*
towards
them
,
that
Franz
saw
it
would
be
cruel
not
to
satisfy
her
*NL*
curiosity
;
and
,
availing
himself
of
one
of
the
privileges
of
the
*NL*
spectators
of
the
Italian
theatres
,
who
use
their
boxes
to
hold
*NL*
receptions
,
the
two
friends
went
to
pay
their
respects
to
the
countess
.
*NL*
Scarcely
had
they
entered
,
when
she
motioned
to
Franz
to
assume
the
seat
*NL*
of
honor
.
Albert
,
in
his
turn
,
sat
behind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
she
,
hardly
giving
Franz
time
to
sit
down
,
``
it
seems
you
*NL*
have
nothing
better
to
do
than
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
this
new
Lord
*NL*
Ruthven
,
and
you
are
already
the
best
friends
in
the
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Without
being
so
far
advanced
as
that
,
my
dear
countess
,
''
returned
*NL*
Franz
,
``
I
can
not
deny
that
we
have
abused
his
good
nature
all
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
day
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
this
morning
we
breakfasted
with
him
;
we
rode
in
his
carriage
all
*NL*
day
,
and
now
we
have
taken
possession
of
his
box
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
him
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
and
no
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
long
story
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
it
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
frighten
you
too
much

said
the
countess
,
who
was
herself
*NL*
from
one
of

Venetian

the

be
very
hard

returned
Albert
,

did
we

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come

observed
the
countess
,
smiling
,
``
I
see

only

*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
``
It

*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
``
He
is
an
original

?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
reality

''
observed
Albert
,
``
he
seemed
to
me
somewhat
eccentric
;
were
*NL*
he
at
Paris
,
and
a
frequenter
of
the
theatres
,
I
should
say
he
was
a
*NL*
poor
devil
literally
mad
.
This
morning
he
made
two
or
three
exits
worthy
*NL*
of
Didier
or
Anthony
.
''
At
this
moment
a
fresh
visitor
entered
,
and
,
*NL*
according
to
custom
,
Franz
gave
up
his
seat
to
him
.
This
circumstance
*NL*
had
,
moreover
,
the
effect
of
changing
the
conversation
;
an
hour
*NL*
afterwards
the
two
friends
returned
to
their
hotel
.
Signor
Pastrini
*NL*
had
already
set
about
procuring
their
disguises
for
the
morrow
;
and
he
*NL*
assured
them
that
they
would
be
perfectly
satisfied
.
The
next
morning
,
*NL*
at
nine
o'clock
,
he
entered
Franz
's
room
,
followed
by
a
tailor
,
who
*NL*
had
eight
or
ten
Roman
peasant
costumes
on
his
arm
;
they
selected
two
*NL*
exactly
alike
,
and
charged
the
tailor
to
sew
on
each
of
their
hats
about
*NL*
twenty
yards
of
ribbon
,
and
to
procure
them
two
of
the
long
silk
sashes
*NL*
of
different
colors
with
which
the
lower
orders
decorate
themselves
on
*NL*
fete-days
.
Albert
was
impatient
to
see
how
he
looked
in
his
new
dress
--
a
*NL*
jacket
and
breeches
of
blue
velvet
,
silk
stockings
with
clocks
,
shoes
*NL*
with
buckles
,
and
a
silk
waistcoat
.
This
picturesque
attire
set
him
off
*NL*
to
great
advantage
;
and
when
he
had
bound
the
scarf
around
his
waist
,
*NL*
and
when
his
hat
,
placed
coquettishly
on
one
side
,
let
fall
on
his
*NL*
shoulder
a
stream
of
ribbons
,
Franz
was
forced
to
confess
that
costume
*NL*
has
much
to
do
with
the
physical
superiority
we
accord
to
certain
*NL*
nations
.
The
Turks
used
to
be
so
picturesque
with
their
long
and
flowing
*NL*
robes
,
but
are
they
not
now
hideous
with
their
blue
frocks
buttoned
up
*NL*
to
the
chin
,
and
their
red
caps
,
which
make
them
look
like
a
bottle
of
*NL*
wine
with
a
red
seal
?
Franz
complimented
Albert
,
who
looked
at
himself
*NL*
in
the
glass
with
an
unequivocal
smile
of
satisfaction
.
They
were
thus
*NL*
engaged
when
the
Count
of
Monte
Cristo
entered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gentlemen
,
''
said
he
,
``
although
a
companion
is
agreeable
,
perfect
*NL*
freedom
is
sometimes
still
more
agreeable
.
I
come
to
say
that
to-day
,
*NL*
and
for
the
remainder
of
the
Carnival
,
I
leave
the
carriage
entirely
at
*NL*
your
disposal
.
The
host
will
tell
you
I
have
three
or
four
more
,
so
that
*NL*
you
will
not
inconvenience
me
in
any
way
.
Make
use
of
it
,
I
pray
you
,
*NL*
for
your
pleasure
or
your
business
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
men
wished
to
decline
,
but
they
could
find
no
good
reason
for
*NL*
refusing
an
offer
which
was
so
agreeable
to
them
.
The
Count
of
Monte
*NL*
Cristo
remained
a
quarter
of
an
hour
with
them
,
conversing
on
all
*NL*
subjects
with
the
greatest
ease
.
He
was
,
as
we
have
already
said
,
*NL*
perfectly
well
acquainted
with
the
literature
of
all
countries
.
A
glance
*NL*
at
the
walls
of
his
salon
proved
to
Franz
and
Albert
that
he
was
a
*NL*
connoisseur
of
pictures
.
A
few
words
he
let
fall
showed
them
that
he
was
*NL*
no
stranger
to
the
sciences
,
and
he
seemed
much
occupied
with
chemistry
.
*NL*
The
two
friends
did
not
venture
to
return
the
count
the
breakfast
he
had
*NL*
given
them
;
it
would
have
been
too
absurd
to
offer
him
in
exchange
for
*NL*
his
excellent
table
the
very
inferior
one
of
Signor
Pastrini
.
They
told
*NL*
him
so
frankly
,
and
he
received
their
excuses
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
*NL*
appreciated
their
delicacy
.
Albert
was
charmed
with
the
count
's
manners
,
*NL*
and
he
was
only
prevented
from
recognizing
him
for
a
perfect
gentleman
*NL*
by
reason
of
his
varied
knowledge
.
The
permission
to
do
what
he
liked
*NL*
with
the
carriage
pleased
him
above
all
,
for
the
fair
peasants
had
*NL*
appeared
in
a
most
elegant
carriage
the
preceding
evening
,
and
Albert
*NL*
was
not
sorry
to
be
upon
an
equal
footing
with
them
.
At
half-past
one
*NL*
they
descended
,
the
coachman
and
footman
had
put
on
their
livery
over
*NL*
their
disguises
,
which
gave
them
a
more
ridiculous
appearance
than
*NL*
ever
,
and
which
gained
them
the
applause
of
Franz
and
Albert
.
Albert
*NL*
had
fastened
the
faded
bunch
of
violets
to
his
button-hole
.
At
the
first
*NL*
sound
of
the
bell
they
hastened
into
the
Corso
by
the
Via
Vittoria
.
At
*NL*
the
second
turn
,
a
bunch
of
fresh
violets
,
thrown
from
a
carriage
filled
*NL*
with
harlequins
,
indicated
to
Albert
that
,
like
himself
and
his
friend
,
*NL*
the
peasants
had
changed
their
costume
,
also
;
and
whether
it
was
the
*NL*
result
of
chance
,
or
whether
a
similar
feeling
had
possessed
them
both
,
*NL*
while
he
had
changed
his
costume
they
had
assumed
his
.
*NL*
*NL*
Albert
placed
the
fresh
bouquet
in
his
button-hole
,
but
he
kept
the
*NL*
faded
one
in
his
hand
;
and
when
he
again
met
the
calash
,
he
raised
it
to
*NL*
his
lips
,
an
action
which
seemed
greatly
to
amuse
not
only
the
fair
lady
*NL*
who
had
thrown
it
,
but
her
joyous
companions
also
.
The
day
was
as
gay
*NL*
as
the
preceding
one
,
perhaps
even
more
animated
and
noisy
;
the
count
*NL*
appeared
for
an
instant
at
his
window
,
but
when
they
again
passed
he
had
*NL*
disappeared
.
It
is
almost
needless
to
say
that
the
flirtation
between
*NL*
Albert
and
the
fair
peasant
continued
all
day
.
In
the
evening
,
on
his
*NL*
return
,
Franz
found
a
letter
from
the
embassy
,
informing
him
that
he
*NL*
would
have
the
honor
of
being
received
by
his
holiness
the
next
day
.
At
*NL*
each
previous
visit
he
had
made
to
Rome
,
he
had
solicited
and
obtained
*NL*
the
same
favor
;
and
incited
as
much
by
a
religious
feeling
as
by
*NL*
gratitude
,
he
was
unwilling
to
quit
the
capital
of
the
Christian
world
*NL*
without
laying
his
respectful
homage
at
the
feet
of
one
of
St.
Peter
's
*NL*
successors
who
has
set
the
rare
example
of
all
the
virtues
.
He
did
*NL*
not
then
think
of
the
Carnival
,
for
in
spite
of
his
condescension
and
*NL*
touching
kindness
,
one
can
not
incline
one
's
self
without
awe
before
the
*NL*
venerable
and
noble
old
man
called
Gregory
XVI
.
On
his
return
from
the
*NL*
Vatican
,
Franz
carefully
avoided
the
Corso
;
he
brought
away
with
him
a
*NL*
treasure
of
pious
thoughts
,
to
which
the
mad
gayety
of
the
maskers
*NL*
would
have
been
profanation
.
At
ten
minutes
past
five
Albert
entered
*NL*
overjoyed
.
The
harlequin
had
reassumed
her
peasant
's
costume
,
and
as
*NL*
she
passed
she
raised
her
mask
.
She
was
charming
.
Franz
congratulated
*NL*
Albert
,
who
received
his
congratulations
with
the
air
of
a
man
conscious
*NL*
that
they
are
merited
.
He
had
recognized
by
certain
unmistakable
signs
,
*NL*
that
his
fair
incognita
belonged
to
the
aristocracy
.
He
had
made
up
his
*NL*
mind
to
write
to
her
the
next
day
.
Franz
remarked
,
while
he
gave
these
*NL*
details
,
that
Albert
seemed
to
have
something
to
ask
of
him
,
but
that
he
*NL*
was
unwilling
to
ask
it
.
He
insisted
upon
it
,
declaring
beforehand
*NL*
that
he
was
willing
to
make
any
sacrifice
the
other
wished
.
Albert
let
*NL*
himself
be
pressed
just
as
long
as
friendship
required
,
and
then
avowed
*NL*
to
Franz
that
he
would
do
him
a
great
favor
by
allowing
him
to
occupy
*NL*
the
carriage
alone
the
next
day
.
Albert
attributed
to
Franz
's
absence
*NL*
the
extreme
kindness
of
the
fair
peasant
in
raising
her
mask
.
Franz
*NL*
was
not
sufficiently
egotistical
to
stop
Albert
in
the
middle
of
an
*NL*
adventure
that
promised
to
prove
so
agreeable
to
his
curiosity
and
so
*NL*
flattering
to
his
vanity
.
He
felt
assured
that
the
perfect
indiscretion
*NL*
of
his
friend
would
duly
inform
him
of
all
that
happened
;
and
as
,
during
*NL*
three
years
that
he
had
travelled
all
over
Italy
,
a
similar
piece
of
*NL*
good
fortune
had
never
fallen
to
his
share
,
Franz
was
by
no
means
sorry
*NL*
to
learn
how
to
act
on
such
an
occasion
.
He
therefore
promised
Albert
*NL*
that
he
would
content
himself
the
morrow
with
witnessing
the
Carnival
*NL*
from
the
windows
of
the
Rospoli
Palace
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
morning
he
saw
Albert
pass
and
repass
,
holding
an
enormous
*NL*
bouquet
,
which
he
doubtless
meant
to
make
the
bearer
of
his
amorous
*NL*
epistle
.
This
belief
was
changed
into
certainty
when
Franz
saw
the
*NL*
bouquet
-LRB-
conspicuous
by
a
circle
of
white
camellias
-RRB-
in
the
hand
of
a
*NL*
charming
harlequin
dressed
in
rose-colored
satin
.
The
evening
was
no
*NL*
longer
joy
,
but
delirium
.
Albert
nothing
doubted
but
that
the
fair
*NL*
unknown
would
reply
in
the
same
manner
.
Franz
anticipated
his
wishes
by
*NL*
saying
that
the
noise
fatigued
him
,
and
that
he
should
pass
the
next
day
*NL*
in
writing
and
looking
over
his
journal
.
Albert
was
not
deceived
,
for
*NL*
the
next
evening
Franz
saw
him
enter
triumphantly
shaking
a
folded
paper
*NL*
which
he
held
by
one
corner
.
``
Well
,
''
said
he
,
``
was
I
mistaken
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
has
answered
you
!
''
cried
Franz
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Read
.
''
This
word
was
pronounced
in
a
manner
impossible
to
describe
.
*NL*
Franz
took
the
letter
,
and
read
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
Tuesday
evening
,
at
seven
o'clock
,
descend
from
your
carriage
opposite
*NL*
the
Via
dei
Pontefici
,
and
follow
the
Roman
peasant
who
snatches
your
*NL*
torch
from
you
.
When
you
arrive
at
the
first
step
of
the
church
of
*NL*
San
Giacomo
,
be
sure
to
fasten
a
knot
of
rose-colored
ribbons
to
the
*NL*
shoulder
of
your
harlequin
costume
,
in
order
that
you
may
be
recognized
.
*NL*
Until
then
you
will
not
see
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
Constancy
and
Discretion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
asked
he
,
when
Franz
had
finished
,
``
what
do
you
think
of
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
that
the
adventure
is
assuming
a
very
agreeable
appearance
.

``
I
think
so
,
also
,
''
replied
Albert
;
``
and
I
very
much
fear
you
will
go
*NL*
alone
to
the
Duke
of
Bracciano
's
ball
.
''
Franz
and
Albert
had
received
*NL*
that
morning
an
invitation
from
the
celebrated
Roman
banker
.
``
Take
care
,
*NL*
Albert
,
''
said
Franz
.
``
All
the
nobility
of
Rome
will
be
present
,
and
if
*NL*
your
fair
incognita
belong
to
the
higher
class
of
society
,
she
must
go
*NL*
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whether
she
goes
there
or
not
,
my
opinion
is
still
the
same
,
''
returned
*NL*
Albert
.
``
You
have
read
the
letter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
how
imperfectly
the
women
of
the
mezzo
cito
are
educated
in
*NL*
Italy

''
-LRB-
This
is
the
name
of
the
lower
class
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
read
the
letter
again
.
Look
at
the
writing
,
and
find
if
you
*NL*
can
,
any
blemish
in
the
language
or
orthography
.
''
-LRB-
The
writing
was
,
in
*NL*
reality
,
charming
,
and
the
orthography
irreproachable
.
-RRB-
``
You
are
born
to
*NL*
good
fortune
,
''
said
Franz
,
as
he
returned
the
letter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Laugh
as
much
as
you
will
,
''
replied
Albert
,
``
I
am
in
love
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
alarm
me
,
''
cried
Franz
.
``
I
see
that
I
shall
not
only
go
alone
to
*NL*
the
Duke
of
Bracciano
's
,
but
also
return
to
Florence
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
my
unknown
be
as
amiable
as
she
is
beautiful
,
''
said
Albert
,
``
I
shall
*NL*
fix
myself
at
Rome
for
six
weeks
,
at
least
.
I
adore
Rome
,
and
I
have
*NL*
always
had
a
great
taste
for
archaeology
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
two
or
three
more
such
adventures
,
and
I
do
not
despair
of
seeing
*NL*
you
a
member
of
the
Academy
.
''
Doubtless
Albert
was
about
to
discuss
*NL*
seriously
his
right
to
the
academic
chair
when
they
were
informed
that
*NL*
dinner
was
ready
.
Albert
's
love
had
not
taken
away
his
appetite
.
He
*NL*
hastened
with
Franz
to
seat
himself
,
free
to
recommence
the
discussion
*NL*
after
dinner
.
After
dinner
,
the
Count
of
Monte
Cristo
was
announced
.
*NL*
They
had
not
seen
him
for
two
days
.
Signor
Pastrini
informed
them
that
*NL*
business
had
called
him
to
Civita
Vecchia
.
He
had
started
the
previous
*NL*
evening
,
and
had
only
returned
an
hour
since
.
He
was
charming
.
Whether
*NL*
he
kept
a
watch
over
himself
,
or
whether
by
accident
he
did
not
sound
*NL*
the
acrimonious
chords
that
in
other
circumstances
had
been
touched
,
he
*NL*
was
to-night
like
everybody
else
.
The
man
was
an
enigma
to
Franz
.
The
*NL*
count
must
feel
sure
that
Franz
recognized
him
;
and
yet
he
had
not
let
*NL*
fall
a
single
word
indicating
any
previous
acquaintance
between
them
.
*NL*
On
his
side
,
however
great
Franz
's
desire
was
to
allude
to
their
former
*NL*
interview
,
the
fear
of
being
disagreeable
to
the
man
who
had
loaded
him
*NL*
and
his
friend
with
kindness
prevented
him
from
mentioning
it
.
The
*NL*
count
had
learned
that
the
two
friends
had
sent
to
secure
a
box
at
the
*NL*
Argentina
Theatre
,
and
were
told
they
were
all
let
.
In
consequence
,
he
*NL*
brought
them
the
key
of
his
own
--
at
least
such
was
the
apparent
motive
*NL*
of
his
visit
.
Franz
and
Albert
made
some
difficulty
,
alleging
their
fear
*NL*
of
depriving
him
of
it
;
but
the
count
replied
that
,
as
he
was
going
to
*NL*
the
Palli
Theatre
,
the
box
at
the
Argentina
Theatre
would
be
lost
if
*NL*
they
did
not
profit
by
it
.
This
assurance
determined
the
two
friends
to
*NL*
accept
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Franz
had
by
degrees
become
accustomed
to
the
count
's
pallor
,
which
had
*NL*
so
forcibly
struck
him
at
their
first
meeting
.
He
could
not
refrain
from
*NL*
admiring
the
severe
beauty
of
his
features
,
the
only
defect
,
or
rather
*NL*
the
principal
quality
of
which
was
the
pallor
.
Truly
,
a
Byronic
hero
!
*NL*
Franz
could
not
,
we
will
not
say
see
him
,
but
even
think
of
him
without
*NL*
imagining
his
stern
head
upon
Manfred
's
shoulders
,
or
beneath
Lara
's
*NL*
helmet
.
His
forehead
was
marked
with
the
line
that
indicates
the
*NL*
constant
presence
of
bitter
thoughts
;
he
had
the
fiery
eyes
that
seem
*NL*
to
penetrate
to
the
very
soul
,
and
the
haughty
and
disdainful
upper
lip
*NL*
that
gives
to
the
words
it
utters
a
peculiar
character
that
impresses
*NL*
them
on
the
minds
of
those
to
whom
they
are
addressed
.
The
count
was
no
*NL*
longer
young
.
He
was
at
least
forty
;
and
yet
it
was
easy
to
understand
*NL*
that
he
was
formed
to
rule
the
young
men
with
whom
he
associated
at
*NL*
present
.
And
,
to
complete
his
resemblance
with
the
fantastic
heroes
of
*NL*
the
English
poet
,
the
count
seemed
to
have
the
power
of
fascination
.
*NL*
Albert
was
constantly
expatiating
on
their
good
fortune
in
meeting
such
*NL*
a
man
.
Franz
was
less
enthusiastic
;
but
the
count
exercised
over
him
*NL*
also
the
ascendency
a
strong
mind
always
acquires
over
a
mind
less
*NL*
domineering
.
He
thought
several
times
of
the
project
the
count
had
*NL*
of
visiting
Paris
;
and
he
had
no
doubt
but
that
,
with
his
eccentric
*NL*
character
,
his
characteristic
face
,
and
his
colossal
fortune
,
he
would
*NL*
produce
a
great
effect
there
.
And
yet
he
did
not
wish
to
be
at
Paris
*NL*
when
the
count
was
there
.
The
evening
passed
as
evenings
mostly
pass
at
*NL*
Italian
theatres
;
that
is
,
not
in
listening
to
the
music
,
but
in
paying
*NL*
visits
and
conversing
.
The
Countess
G
--
wished
to
revive
the
subject
of
*NL*
the
count
,
but
Franz
announced
he
had
something
far
newer
to
tell
her
,
*NL*
and
,
in
spite
of
Albert
's
demonstrations
of
false
modesty
,
he
informed
*NL*
the
countess
of
the
great
event
which
had
preoccupied
them
for
the
last
*NL*
three
days
.
As
similar
intrigues
are
not
uncommon
in
Italy
,
if
we
may
*NL*
credit
travellers
,
the
comtess
did
not
manifest
the
least
incredulity
,
*NL*
but
congratulated
Albert
on
his
success
.
They
promised
,
upon
separating
,
*NL*
to
meet
at
the
Duke
of
Bracciano
's
ball
,
to
which
all
Rome
was
invited
.
*NL*
The
heroine
of
the
bouquet
kept
her
word
;
she
gave
Albert
no
sign
of
her
*NL*
existence
the
morrow
or
the
day
after
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
Tuesday
came
,
the
last
and
most
tumultuous
day
of
the
*NL*
Carnival
.
On
Tuesday
,
the
theatres
open
at
ten
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
*NL*
as
Lent
begins
after
eight
at
night
.
On
Tuesday
,
all
those
who
through
*NL*
want
of
money
,
time
,
or
enthusiasm
,
have
not
been
to
see
the
Carnival
*NL*
before
,
mingle
in
the
gayety
,
and
contribute
to
the
noise
and
*NL*
excitement
.
From
two
o'clock
till
five
Franz
and
Albert
followed
in
the
*NL*
fete
,
exchanging
handfuls
of
confetti
with
the
other
carriages
and
*NL*
the
pedestrians
,
who
crowded
amongst
the
horses
'
feet
and
the
carriage
*NL*
wheels
without
a
single
accident
,
a
single
dispute
,
or
a
single
fight
.
*NL*
The
fetes
are
veritable
pleasure
days
to
the
Italians
.
The
author
of
*NL*
this
history
,
who
has
resided
five
or
six
years
in
Italy
,
does
not
*NL*
recollect
to
have
ever
seen
a
ceremony
interrupted
by
one
of
those
*NL*
events
so
common
in
other
countries
.
Albert
was
triumphant
in
his
*NL*
harlequin
costume
.
A
knot
of
rose-colored
ribbons
fell
from
his
shoulder
*NL*
almost
to
the
ground
.
In
order
that
there
might
be
no
confusion
,
Franz
*NL*
wore
his
peasant
's
costume
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
day
advanced
,
the
tumult
became
greater
.
There
was
not
on
the
*NL*
pavement
,
in
the
carriages
,
at
the
windows
,
a
single
tongue
that
was
*NL*
silent
,
a
single
arm
that
did
not
move
.
It
was
a
human
storm
,
made
up
*NL*
of
a
thunder
of
cries
,
and
a
hail
of
sweetmeats
,
flowers
,
eggs
,
oranges
,
*NL*
and
nosegays
.
At
three
o'clock
the
sound
of
fireworks
,
let
off
on
the
*NL*
Piazza
del
Popolo
and
the
Piazza
di
Venezia
-LRB-
heard
with
difficulty
amid
*NL*
the
din
and
confusion
-RRB-
announced
that
the
races
were
about
to
begin
.
The
*NL*
races
,
like
the
moccoli
,
are
one
of
the
episodes
peculiar
to
the
last
*NL*
days
of
the
Carnival
.
At
the
sound
of
the
fireworks
the
carriages
*NL*
instantly
broke
ranks
,
and
retired
by
the
adjacent
streets
.
All
these
*NL*
evolutions
are
executed
with
an
inconceivable
address
and
marvellous
*NL*
rapidity
,
without
the
police
interfering
in
the
matter
.
The
pedestrians
*NL*
ranged
themselves
against
the
walls
;
then
the
trampling
of
horses
and
*NL*
the
clashing
of
steel
were
heard
.
A
detachment
of
carbineers
,
fifteen
*NL*
abreast
,
galloped
up
the
Corso
in
order
to
clear
it
for
the
barberi
.
*NL*
When
the
detachment
arrived
at
the
Piazza
di
Venezia
,
a
second
volley
of
*NL*
fireworks
was
discharged
,
to
announce
that
the
street
was
clear
.
Almost
*NL*
instantly
,
in
the
midst
of
a
tremendous
and
general
outcry
,
seven
*NL*
or
eight
horses
,
excited
by
the
shouts
of
three
hundred
thousand
*NL*
spectators
,
passed
by
like
lightning
.
Then
the
Castle
of
Saint
Angelo
*NL*
fired
three
cannon
to
indicate
that
number
three
had
won
.
Immediately
,
*NL*
without
any
other
signal
,
the
carriages
moved
on
,
flowing
on
towards
the
*NL*
Corso
,
down
all
the
streets
,
like
torrents
pent
up
for
a
while
,
which
*NL*
again
flow
into
the
parent
river
;
and
the
immense
stream
again
continued
*NL*
its
course
between
its
two
granite
banks
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
new
source
of
noise
and
movement
was
added
to
the
crowd
.
The
sellers
*NL*
of
moccoletti
entered
on
the
scene
.
The
moccoli
,
or
moccoletti
,
are
*NL*
candles
which
vary
in
size
from
the
pascal
taper
to
the
rushlight
,
and
*NL*
which
give
to
each
actor
in
the
great
final
scene
of
the
Carnival
two
*NL*
very
serious
problems
to
grapple
with
,
--
first
,
how
to
keep
his
own
*NL*
moccoletto
alight
;
and
secondly
,
how
to
extinguish
the
moccoletti
of
*NL*
others
.
The
moccoletto
is
like
life
:
man
has
found
but
one
means
of
*NL*
transmitting
it
,
and
that
one
comes
from
God
.
But
he
has
discovered
a
*NL*
thousand
means
of
taking
it
away
,
and
the
devil
has
somewhat
aided
him
.
*NL*
The
moccoletto
is
kindled
by
approaching
it
to
a
light
.
But
who
can
*NL*
describe
the
thousand
means
of
extinguishing
the
moccoletto
?
--
the
*NL*
gigantic
bellows
,
the
monstrous
extinguishers
,
the
superhuman
fans
.
*NL*
Every
one
hastened
to
purchase
moccoletti
--
Franz
and
Albert
among
the
*NL*
rest
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
night
was
rapidly
approaching
;
and
already
,
at
the
cry
of
*NL*
``
Moccoletti
!
''
repeated
by
the
shrill
voices
of
a
thousand
vendors
,
two
*NL*
or
three
stars
began
to
burn
among
the
crowd
.
It
was
a
signal
.
At
the
*NL*
end
of
ten
minutes
fifty
thousand
lights
glittered
,
descending
from
*NL*
the
Palazzo
di
Venezia
to
the
Piazza
del
Popolo
,
and
mounting
from
the
*NL*
Piazzo
del
Popolo
to
the
Palazzo
di
Venezia
.
It
seemed
like
the
fete
of
*NL*
jack-o
'
-
lanterns
.
It
is
impossible
to
form
any
idea
of
it
without
having
*NL*
seen
it
.
Suppose
that
all
the
stars
had
descended
from
the
sky
and
*NL*
mingled
in
a
wild
dance
on
the
face
of
the
earth
;
the
whole
accompanied
*NL*
by
cries
that
were
never
heard
in
any
other
part
of
the
world
.
The
*NL*
facchino
follows
the
prince
,
the
Transteverin
the
citizen
,
every
one
*NL*
blowing
,
extinguishing
,
relighting
.
Had
old
AEolus
appeared
at
this
*NL*
moment
,
he
would
have
been
proclaimed
king
of
the
moccoli
,
and
Aquilo
*NL*
the
heir-presumptive
to
the
throne
.
This
battle
of
folly
and
flame
*NL*
continued
for
two
hours
;
the
Corso
was
light
as
day
;
the
features
of
*NL*
the
spectators
on
the
third
and
fourth
stories
were
visible
.
Every
five
*NL*
minutes
Albert
took
out
his
watch
;
at
length
it
pointed
to
seven
.
The
*NL*
two
friends
were
in
the
Via
dei
Pontefici
.
Albert
sprang
out
,
bearing
*NL*
his
moccoletto
in
his
hand
.
Two
or
three
masks
strove
to
knock
his
*NL*
moccoletto
out
of
his
hand
;
but
Albert
,
a
first-rate
pugilist
,
sent
them
*NL*
rolling
in
the
street
,
one
after
the
other
,
and
continued
his
course
*NL*
towards
the
church
of
San
Giacomo
.
The
steps
were
crowded
with
masks
,
*NL*
who
strove
to
snatch
each
other
's
torches
.
Franz
followed
Albert
with
*NL*
his
eyes
,
and
saw
him
mount
the
first
step
.
Instantly
a
mask
,
wearing
*NL*
the
well-known
costume
of
a
peasant
woman
,
snatched
his
moccoletto
from
*NL*
him
without
his
offering
any
resistance
.
Franz
was
too
far
off
to
hear
*NL*
what
they
said
;
but
,
without
doubt
,
nothing
hostile
passed
,
for
he
saw
*NL*
Albert
disappear
arm-in-arm
with
the
peasant
girl
.
He
watched
them
pass
*NL*
through
the
crowd
for
some
time
,
but
at
length
he
lost
sight
of
them
in
*NL*
the
Via
Macello
.
Suddenly
the
bell
that
gives
the
signal
for
the
end
of
*NL*
the
carnival
sounded
,
and
at
the
same
instant
all
the
moccoletti
were
*NL*
extinguished
as
if
by
enchantment
.
It
seemed
as
though
one
immense
blast
*NL*
of
the
wind
had
extinguished
every
one
.
Franz
found
himself
in
utter
*NL*
darkness
.
No
sound
was
audible
save
that
of
the
carriages
that
were
*NL*
carrying
the
maskers
home
;
nothing
was
visible
save
a
few
lights
that
*NL*
burnt
behind
the
windows
.
The
Carnival
was
over
.

whole
life
,
perhaps
,
Franz
had
never
before
experienced
so
sudden
*NL*
an
impression
,
so
rapid
a
transition
from
gayety
to
sadness
,
as
in
this
*NL*
moment
.
It
seemed
as
though
Rome
,
under
the
magic
breath
of
some
demon
*NL*
of
the
night
,
had
suddenly
changed
into
a
vast
tomb
.
By
a
chance
,
which
*NL*
added
yet
more
to
the
intensity
of
the
darkness
,
the
moon
,
which
was
on
*NL*
the
wane
,
did
not
rise
until
eleven
o'clock
,
and
the
streets
which
the
*NL*
young
man
traversed
were
plunged
in
the
deepest
obscurity
.
The
distance
*NL*
was
short
,
and
at
the
end
of
ten
minutes
his
carriage
,
or
rather
the
*NL*
count
's
,
stopped
before
the
Hotel
de
Londres
.
Dinner
was
waiting
,
but
*NL*
as
Albert
had
told
him
that
he
should
not
return
so
soon
,
Franz
sat
down
*NL*
without
him
.
Signor
Pastrini
,
who
had
been
accustomed
to
see
them
dine
*NL*
together
,
inquired
into
the
cause
of
his
absence
,
but
Franz
merely
*NL*
replied
that
Albert
had
received
on
the
previous
evening
an
invitation
*NL*
which
he
had
accepted
.
The
sudden
extinction
of
the
moccoletti
,
the
*NL*
darkness
which
had
replaced
the
light
,
and
the
silence
which
had
*NL*
succeeded
the
turmoil
,
had
left
in
Franz
's
mind
a
certain
depression
*NL*
which
was
not
free
from
uneasiness
.
He
therefore
dined
very
silently
,
in
*NL*
spite
of
the
officious
attention
of
his
host
,
who
presented
himself
two
*NL*
or
three
times
to
inquire
if
he
wanted
anything
.
*NL*
*NL*
Franz
resolved
to
wait
for
Albert
as
late
as
possible
.
He
ordered
the
*NL*
carriage
,
therefore
,
for
eleven
o'clock
,
desiring
Signor
Pastrini
to
*NL*
inform
him
the
moment
that
Albert
returned
to
the
hotel
.
At
eleven
*NL*
o'clock
Albert
had
not
come
back
.
Franz
dressed
himself
,
and
went
out
,
*NL*
telling
his
host
that
he
was
going
to
pass
the
night
at
the
Duke
of
*NL*
Bracciano
's
.
The
house
of
the
Duke
of
Bracciano
is
one
of
the
most
*NL*
delightful
in
Rome
,
the
duchess
,
one
of
the
last
heiresses
of
the
*NL*
Colonnas
,
does
its
honors
with
the
most
consummate
grace
,
and
thus
their
*NL*
fetes
have
a
European
celebrity
.
Franz
and
Albert
had
brought
to
Rome
*NL*
letters
of
introduction
to
them
,
and
their
first
question
on
his
arrival
*NL*
was
to
inquire
the
whereabouts
of
his
travelling
companion
.
Franz
*NL*
replied
that
he
had
left
him
at
the
moment
they
were
about
to
extinguish
*NL*
the
moccoli
,
and
that
he
had
lost
sight
of
him
in
the
Via
Macello
.
``
Then
*NL*
he
has
not
returned
?
''
said
the
duke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
waited
for
him
until
this
hour
,
''
replied
Franz
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
do
you
know
whither
he
went
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
not
precisely
;
however
,
I
think
it
was
something
very
like
a
*NL*
rendezvous
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Diavolo
!
''
said
the
duke
,
``
this
is
a
bad
day
,
or
rather
a
bad
night
,
*NL*
to
be
out
late
;
is
it
not
,
countess
!
''
These
words
were
addressed
to
*NL*
the
Countess
G
--
,
who
had
just
arrived
,
and
was
leaning
on
the
arm
of
*NL*
Signor
Torlonia
,
the
duke
's
brother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
,
on
the
contrary
,
that
it
is
a
charming
night
,
''
replied
the
*NL*
countess
,
``
and
those
who
are
here
will
complain
of
but
one
thing
--
its
*NL*
too
rapid
flight
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
speaking
,
''
said
the
duke
with
a
smile
,
``
of
the
persons
who
are
*NL*
here
;
the
men
run
no
other
danger
than
that
of
falling
in
love
with
*NL*
you
,
and
the
women
of
falling
ill
of
jealousy
at
seeing
you
so
lovely
;
I
*NL*
meant
persons
who
were
out
in
the
streets
of
Rome
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
asked
the
countess
,
``
who
is
out
in
the
streets
of
Rome
at
this
*NL*
hour
,
unless
it
be
to
go
to
a
ball
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Our
friend
,
Albert
de
Morcerf
,
countess
,
whom
I
left
in
pursuit
of
his
*NL*
unknown
about
seven
o'clock
this
evening
,
''
said
Franz
,
``
and
whom
I
have
*NL*
not
seen
since
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
do
n't
you
know
where
he
is
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
he
armed
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
in
masquerade
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
should
not
have
allowed
him
to
go
,
''
said
the
duke
to
Franz
;
``
you
,
*NL*
who
know
Rome
better
than
he
does
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
might
as
well
have
tried
to
stop
number
three
of
the
barberi
,
who
*NL*
gained
the
prize
in
the
race
to-day
,

replied
Franz
;
``
and
then
moreover
,
*NL*
what
could
happen
to
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
can
tell
?
The
night
is
gloomy
,
and
the
Tiber
is
very
near
the
Via
*NL*
Macello
.
''
Franz
felt
a
shudder
run
through
his
veins
at
observing
that
*NL*
the
feeling
of
the
duke
and
the
countess
was
so
much
in
unison
with
his
*NL*
own
personal
disquietude
.
``
I
informed
them
at
the
hotel
that
I
had
the
*NL*
honor
of
passing
the
night
here
,
duke

said
Franz
,
``
and
desired
them
to
*NL*
come
and
inform
me
of
his
return

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

''
replied
the
duke
,
``
here
I
think
,
is
one
of
my
servants
who
is
*NL*
seeking
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
duke
was
not
mistaken
;
when
he
saw
Franz
,
the
servant
came
up
to
*NL*
him
.
``
Your
excellency
,
''
he
said
,
``
the
master
of
the
Hotel
de
Londres
has
*NL*
sent

*NL*
*NL*
``
A

Franz

``
The

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
where
is
the

*NL*
*NL*
``
He
went
away
directly

enter
the
ball-room
to
find
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
said
the
countess
to
Franz
,
``
go
with
all
speed

poor
young
man

*NL*
Perhaps
some
accident
has
happened
to
him

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
hasten
,
''
replied
Franz
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
we
see
you
again
to
give
us
any
information
?

inquired
the
*NL*
countess
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

it

do
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
prudent
,
in
any
event
,
''
said
the
countess
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
pray
be
assured
of
that
.
''
Franz
took
his
hat
and
went
away
in
*NL*
haste
.
He
had
sent
away
his
carriage
with
orders
for
it
to
fetch
him
at
*NL*
two
o'clock
;
fortunately
the
Palazzo
Bracciano
,
which
is
on
one
side
*NL*
in
the
Corso
,
and
on
the
other
in
the
Square
of
the
Holy
Apostles
,
is
*NL*
hardly
ten
minutes
'
walk
from
the
Hotel
de
Londres
.
As
he
came
near
the
*NL*
hotel
,
Franz
saw
a
man
in
the
middle
of
the
street
.
He
had
no
doubt
*NL*
that
it
was
the
messenger
from
Albert
.
The
man
was
wrapped
up
in
a
large
*NL*
cloak
.
He
went
up
to
him
,
but
,
to
his
extreme
astonishment
,
the
stranger
*NL*
first
addressed
him
.
``
What
wants
your
excellency
of
me
?
''
inquired
the
*NL*
man
,
retreating
a
step
or
two
,
as
if
to
keep
on
his
guard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
not
you
the
person
who
brought
me
a
letter
,
''
inquired
Franz
,
``
from
*NL*
the
Viscount
of
Morcerf
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
excellency
lodges
at
Pastrini

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
Your

*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
``
Your

*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
it
is
to
your

is
addressed

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
there
any

inquired
Franz
,
taking
the
letter
from
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

your
friend
at
least
hopes
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
up-stairs
with
me
,
and
I
will
give
it
to
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
prefer
waiting
here

said
the
messenger
,
with
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
excellency

know

*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
I
find
you
here
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly

''
*NL*
*NL*
Franz
entered
the
hotel
.
On
the
staircase
he
met
Signor
Pastrini
.
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
said
the
landlord
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
what
?
''
responded
Franz
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
seen
the
man
who
desired
to
speak
with
you
from
your
friend

''
*NL*
he
asked
of
Franz
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
have
seen
him
,
''
he
replied
,
``
and
he
has
handed
this
letter
to
*NL*
me
.
Light
the
candles
in
my
apartment
,
if
you
please
.
''
The
inn-keeper
*NL*
gave
orders
to
a
servant
to
go
before
Franz
with
a
light
.
The
young
man
*NL*
had
found
Signor
Pastrini
looking
very
much
alarmed
,
and
this
had
*NL*
only
made
him
the
more
anxious
to
read
Albert
's
letter
;
and
so
he
went
*NL*
instantly
towards
the
waxlight
,
and
unfolded
it
.
It
was
written
and
*NL*
signed
by
Albert
.
Franz
read
it
twice
before
he
could
comprehend
what
it
*NL*
contained
.
It
was
thus
worded
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
My
Dear
Fellow
,
--
The
moment
you
have
received
this
,
have
the
kindness
*NL*
to
take
the
letter
of
credit
from
my
pocket-book
,
which
you
will
find
*NL*
in
the
square
drawer
of
the
secretary
;
add
your
own
to
it
,
if
it
be
*NL*
not
sufficient
.
Run
to
Torlonia
,
draw
from
him
instantly
four
thousand
*NL*
piastres
,
and
give
them
to
the
bearer
.
It
is
urgent
that
I
should
have
*NL*
this
money
without
delay
.
I
do
not
say
more
,
relying
on
you
as
you
may
*NL*
rely
on
me
.
Your
friend
,
*NL*
*NL*
Albert
de
Morcerf
.
*NL*
*NL*
P.S.
--
I
now
believe
in
Italian
banditti
.
*NL*
*NL*
Below
these
lines
were
written
,
in
a
strange
hand
,
the
following
in
*NL*
Italian
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
Se
alle
sei
della
mattina
le
quattro
mile
piastre
non
sono
nelle
mie
*NL*
mani
,
alla
sette
il
conte
Alberto
avra
cessato
di
vivere
.
*NL*
*NL*
Luigi
Vampa
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
by
six
in
the
morning
the
four
thousand
piastres
are
not
in
my
*NL*
hands
,
by
seven
o'clock
the
Count
Albert
will
have
ceased
to
live
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
second
signature
explained
everything
to
Franz
,
who
now
understood
*NL*
the
objection
of
the
messenger
to
coming
up
into
the
apartment
;
the
*NL*
street
was
safer
for
him
.
Albert
,
then
,
had
fallen
into
the
hands
of
*NL*
the
famous
bandit
chief
,
in
whose
existence
he
had
for
so
long
a
time
*NL*
refused
to
believe
.
There
was
no
time
to
lose
.
He
hastened
to
open
the
*NL*
secretary
,
and
found
the
pocket-book
in
the
drawer
,
and
in
it
the
letter
*NL*
of
credit
.
There
were
in
all
six
thousand
piastres
,
but
of
these
six
*NL*
thousand
Albert
had
already
expended
three
thousand
.
As
to
Franz
,
he
had
*NL*
no
letter
of
credit
,
as
he
lived
at
Florence
,
and
had
only
come
to
Rome
*NL*
to
pass
seven
or
eight
days
;
he
had
brought
but
a
hundred
louis
,
and
*NL*
of
these
he
had
not
more
than
fifty
left
.
Thus
seven
or
eight
hundred
*NL*
piastres
were
wanting
to
them
both
to
make
up
the
sum
that
Albert
*NL*
required
.
True
,
he
might
in
such
a
case
rely
on
the
kindness
of
Signor
*NL*
Torlonia
.
He
was
,
therefore
,
about
to
return
to
the
Palazzo
Bracciano
*NL*
without
loss
of
time
,
when
suddenly
a
luminous
idea
crossed
his
mind
.
He
*NL*
remembered
the
Count
of
Monte
Cristo
.
Franz
was
about
to
ring
for
Signor
*NL*
Pastrini
,
when
that
worthy
presented
himself
.
``
My
dear
sir
,
''
he
said
,
*NL*
hastily
,
``
do
you
know
if
the
count
is
within
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
your
excellency
;
he
has
this
moment
returned
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
he
in
bed
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
say
no
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
ring
at
his
door
,
if
you
please
,
and
request
him
to
be
so
kind
*NL*
as
to
give
me
an
audience
.
''
Signor
Pastrini
did
as
he
was
desired
,
*NL*
and
returning
five
minutes
after
,
he
said
,
--
``
The
count
awaits
your
*NL*
excellency
.
''
Franz
went
along
the
corridor
,
and
a
servant
introduced
him
*NL*
to
the
count
.
He
was
in
a
small
room
which
Franz
had
not
yet
seen
,
and
*NL*
which
was
surrounded
with
divans
.
The
count
came
towards
him
.
``
Well
,
*NL*
what
good
wind
blows
you
hither
at
this
hour
?
''
said
he
;
``
have
you
come
*NL*
to
sup
with
me
?
It
would
be
very
kind
of
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
I
have
come
to
speak
to
you
of
a

*NL*
``

the

looking
at
Franz
with
the

earnestness
usual
to
him
;

it

*NL*

Are

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

replied
the
count
,
going
to
the
door
,
and
returning
.
Franz
gave
*NL*
him
Albert
's
letter
.
``
Read
that

he
said

The

read
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
What

you

Franz

*NL*

Have
you
the

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

The
count
went
to
his
secretary
,
*NL*
opened
it
,
and
pulling
out
a
drawer
filled
with
gold
,
said
to
Franz
,
--
``
I

hope
you

not

*NL*
``
You

Franz

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
thank
you

he
made
a
sign
to
Franz
to
*NL*
take
what
he
pleased

*NL*
*NL*
``
Is

absolutely
necessary

*NL*
asked
the
young
man
,
looking
fixedly
in
his
turn
at
the
count

*NL*
*NL*
``
Judge

yourself

replied
he
.
``
The

*NL*
*NL*

said
Franz

*NL*
*NL*
``
How
so

returned
the

with
surprise

*NL*
*NL*
``
If

I

*NL*
*NL*
``
What

No

The

knit
his

remained
silent
an

The
count
went
to
the
window
of
the
apartment
that
*NL*
looked
on
to
the
street
,
and
whistled
in
a
peculiar
manner
.
The
man
in
*NL*
the
mantle
quitted
the
wall
,
and
advanced
into
the
middle
of
the
street
.
*NL*
``
Salite
!

said
the
count
,
in
the
same
tone
in
which
he
would
have
*NL*
given
an
order
to
his
servant
.
The
messenger
obeyed
without
the
least
*NL*
hesitation
,
but
rather
with
alacrity
,
and
,
mounting
the
steps
at
a
*NL*
bound
,
entered
the
hotel
;
five
seconds
afterwards
he
was
at
the
door
of
*NL*
the
room
.
``
Ah
,
it
is
you

Peppino

said
the
count
.
But
Peppino
,
instead
*NL*
of
answering
,
threw
himself
on
his
knees
,
seized
the
count
's
hand
,
*NL*
and
covered
it
with
kisses
.
``
Ah
,
''
said
the
count
,
``
you
have
,
then

not
*NL*
forgotten

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

accent

profound
gratitude

*NL*
*NL*
``
Never

Peppino
glanced
anxiously
at
Franz

``
Oh

you
may
speak

said
he
;

You

the

in
French

*NL*
*NL*

Excellency

``
The

The

all
this

consent

chief

who
was
in

carriage

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What

cried
Franz
,
``
was
Luigi
Vampa
in
the
carriage
with
the
Roman

*NL*
*NL*
``
It

the

Well

the
Frenchman
took
off
his
mask

Teresa

with

did
the
same
.
The
Frenchman
asked
for
a
rendezvous
;
Teresa
gave
*NL*
him
one
--
only
,
instead
of
Teresa
,
it
was
Beppo
who
was
on
the
steps
of
*NL*
the
church
of
San
Giacomo
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What

exclaimed
Franz
,
``
the
peasant
girl

snatched
his
mocoletto
*NL*
from
him

--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
a
lad
of
fifteen

replied
Peppino
.
``
But
it
was
no
disgrace
to
your

have
been
deceived

Beppo
has
taken
in
plenty

others

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
Beppo
led
him
outside
the
walls

said
the
count

*NL*
*NL*
``
Exactly
so
;
a
carriage
was
waiting
at
the
end
of
the
Via
Macello
.
Beppo
*NL*
got
in
,
inviting
the
Frenchman
to
follow
him
,
and
he
did
not
wait
to
be
*NL*
asked
twice
.
He
gallantly
offered
the
right-hand
seat
to
Beppo
,
and
sat
*NL*
by
him
.
Beppo
told
him
he
was
going
to
take
him
to
a
villa
a
league
from
*NL*
Rome
;
the
Frenchman
assured
him
he
would
follow
him
to
the
end
of
the
*NL*
world

The
coachman
went
up
the
Via
di
Ripetta
and
the
Porta
San
Paola
;
*NL*
and
when
they
were
two
hundred
yards
outside
,
as
the
Frenchman
became
*NL*
somewhat
too
forward
,
Beppo
put
a
brace
of
pistols
to
his
head
,
the
*NL*
coachman
pulled
up
and
did
the

At
the
same
time
,
four
of
the
band
,
*NL*
who
were
concealed
on
the
banks
of
the
Almo

surrounded
the
carriage

*NL*
The
Frenchman
made
some
resistance

nearly
strangled
Beppo
;
but
he
*NL*
could
not
resist
five
armed
men
,

was
forced
to
yield
.
They
made
*NL*
him
get
out
,
walk
along
the
banks
of
the
river
,
and
then
brought
him
*NL*
to
Teresa

Luigi

who
were
waiting
for
him
in
the
catacombs
of
St.
*NL*
Sebastian
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

said
the
count
,
turning
towards
Franz
,
``
it
seems
to
me
that
this

is
a
very
likely
story

What
do
you
say
to

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

I

Franz

be
assured

his
alarm
will
be
the
only
serious

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
shall
we
go

inquired
Franz

*NL*
``
Oh

catacombs
of
St.

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
never

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

here
is
an
opportunity
made
to
your

it
would
be

better

Have
you
a
carriage

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
``
Always

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

I
am
a
very
capricious

I
should
tell
you
that
sometimes
*NL*
when
I
rise
,
or
after
my
dinner
,
or
in
the
middle
of
the
night

I
*NL*
resolve
on
starting
for
some
particular
point

away

The
count
*NL*
rang
,
and
a
footman
appeared
.
``
Order
out
the
carriage

he
said
,
``
and
*NL*
remove
the
pistols

You
need
not
awaken

Ali
will
drive
.
''
In
a
very
short
time
the
noise
of
wheels
*NL*
was
heard
,
and
the
carriage
stopped
at
the
door
.
The
count
took
out
his
*NL*
watch
.
``
Half-past
twelve
,
''
he
said
.
``
We
might
start
at
five
o'clock

*NL*
be
in
time

the
delay
may
cause
your

pass
an
uneasy
night
,
*NL*
and
therefore
we
had
better
go
with
all
speed
to
extricate
him
from
the
*NL*
hands
of
the
infidels
.
Are
you
still
resolved
to
accompany
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
More
determined
than
ever

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
come
along
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Franz
and
the
count
went
downstairs
,
accompanied
by
Peppino
.
At
the
door
*NL*
they
found
the
carriage
.
Ali
was
on
the
box
,
in
whom
Franz
recognized
*NL*
the
dumb
slave
of
the
grotto
of
Monte
Cristo
.
Franz
and
the
count
got
*NL*
into
the
carriage
.
Peppino
placed
himself
beside
Ali
,
and
they
set
off
*NL*
at
a
rapid
pace
.
Ali
had
received
his
instructions
,
and
went
down
the
*NL*
Corso
,
crossed
the
Campo
Vaccino
,
went
up
the
Strada
San
Gregorio
,
*NL*
and
reached
the
gates
of
St.
Sebastian
.
Then
the
porter
raised
some
*NL*
difficulties
,
but
the
Count
of
Monte
Cristo
produced
a
permit
from
the
*NL*
governor
of
Rome
,
allowing
him
to
leave
or
enter
the
city
at
any
hour
of
*NL*
the
day
or
night
;
the
portcullis
was
therefore
raised
,
the
porter
had
*NL*
a
louis
for
his
trouble
,
and
they
went
on
their
way
.
The
road
which
the
*NL*
carriage
now
traversed
was
the
ancient
Appian
Way
,
and
bordered
with
*NL*
tombs
.
From
time
to
time
,
by
the
light
of
the
moon
,
which
began
to
rise
,
*NL*
Franz
imagined
that
he
saw
something
like
a
sentinel
appear
at
various
*NL*
points
among
the
ruins
,
and
suddenly
retreat
into
the
darkness
on
a
*NL*
signal
from
Peppino
.
A
short
time
before
they
reached
the
Baths
of
*NL*
Caracalla
the
carriage
stopped
,
Peppino
opened
the
door
,
and
the
count
*NL*
and
Franz
alighted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
ten
minutes
,
''
said
the
count
to
his
companion
,
``
we
shall
be
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
then
took
Peppino
aside
,
gave
him
an
order
in
a
low
voice
,
and
*NL*
Peppino
went
away
,
taking
with
him
a
torch
,
brought
with
them
in
the
*NL*
carriage
.
Five
minutes
elapsed
,
during
which
Franz
saw
the
shepherd
*NL*
going
along
a
narrow
path
that
led
over
the
irregular
and
broken
surface
*NL*
of
the
Campagna
;
and
finally
he
disappeared
in
the
midst
of
the
tall
*NL*
red
herbage
,
which
seemed
like
the
bristling
mane
of
an
enormous
lion
.
*NL*
``
Now
,
''
said
the
count
,
``
let
us
follow
him
.
''
Franz
and
the
count
in
their
*NL*
turn
then
advanced
along
the
same
path
,
which
,
at
the
distance
of
*NL*
a
hundred
paces
,
led
them
over
a
declivity
to
the
bottom
of
a
small
*NL*
valley
.
They
then
perceived
two
men
conversing
in
the
obscurity
.
``
Ought
*NL*
we
to
go
on
?
''
asked
Franz
of
the
count
;
``
or
shall
we
wait
awhile
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
go
on
;
Peppino
will
have
warned
the
sentry
of
our
coming
.
''
One
*NL*
of
the
two
men
was
Peppino
,
and
the
other
a
bandit
on
the
lookout
.
Franz
*NL*
and
the
count
advanced
,
and
the
bandit
saluted
them
.
``
Your
excellency
,
''
*NL*
said
Peppino
,
addressing
the
count
,
``
if
you
will
follow
me
,
the
opening
*NL*
of
the
catacombs
is
close
at
hand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
on
,
then
,
''
replied
the
count
.
They
came
to
an
opening
behind
a
clump
*NL*
of
bushes
and
in
the
midst
of
a
pile
of
rocks
,
by
which
a
man
could
*NL*
scarcely
pass
.
Peppino
glided
first
into
this
crevice
;
after
they
got
*NL*
along
a
few
paces
the
passage
widened
.
Peppino
passed
,
lighted
his
*NL*
torch
,
and
turned
to
see
if
they
came
after
him
.
The
count
first
reached
*NL*
an
open
space
and
Franz
followed
him
closely
.
The
passageway
sloped
in
*NL*
a
gentle
descent
,
enlarging
as
they
proceeded
;
still
Franz
and
the
count
*NL*
were
compelled
to
advance
in
a
stooping
posture
,
and
were
scarcely
able
*NL*
to
proceed
abreast
of
one
another
.
They
went
on
a
hundred
and
fifty
*NL*
paces
in
this
way
,
and
then
were
stopped
by
,
``
Who
comes
there
?
''
At
the
*NL*
same
time
they
saw
the
reflection
of
a
torch
on
a
carbine
barrel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
friend
!
''
responded
Peppino
;
and
,
advancing
alone
towards
the
sentry
,
*NL*
he
said
a
few
words
to
him
in
a
low
tone
;
and
then
he
,
like
the
first
,
*NL*
saluted
the
nocturnal
visitors
,
making
a
sign
that
they
might
proceed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Behind
the
sentinel
was
a
staircase
with
twenty
steps
.
Franz
and
the
*NL*
count
descended
these
,
and
found
themselves
in
a
mortuary
chamber
.
Five
*NL*
corridors
diverged
like
the
rays
of
a
star
,
and
the
walls
,
dug
into
*NL*
niches
,
which
were
arranged
one
above
the
other
in
the
shape
of
*NL*
coffins
,
showed
that
they
were
at
last
in
the
catacombs
.
Down
one
of
the
*NL*
corridors
,
whose
extent
it
was
impossible
to
determine
,
rays
of
light
*NL*
were
visible
.
The
count
laid
his
hand
on
Franz
's
shoulder
.
``
Would
you
*NL*
like
to
see
a
camp
of
bandits
in
repose
?
''
he
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Exceedingly
,
''
replied
Franz
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
with
me
,
then
.
Peppino
,
put
out
the
torch
.
''
Peppino
obeyed
,
and
*NL*
Franz
and
the
count
were
in
utter
darkness
,
except
that
fifty
paces
in
*NL*
advance
of
them
a
reddish
glare
,
more
evident
since
Peppino
had
put
out
*NL*
his
torch
,
was
visible
along
the
wall
.
They
advanced
silently
,
the
count
*NL*
guiding
Franz
as
if
he
had
the
singular
faculty
of
seeing
in
the
dark
.
*NL*
Franz
himself
,
however
,
saw
his
way
more
plainly
in
proportion
as
he
*NL*
went
on
towards
the
light
,
which
served
in
some
manner
as
a
guide
.
Three
*NL*
arcades
were
before
them
,
and
the
middle
one
was
used
as
a
door
.
These
*NL*
arcades
opened
on
one
side
into
the
corridor
where
the
count
and
Franz
*NL*
were
,
and
on
the
other
into
a
large
square
chamber
,
entirely
surrounded
*NL*
by
niches
similar
to
those
of
which
we
have
spoken
.
In
the
midst
of
this
*NL*
chamber
were
four
stones
,
which
had
formerly
served
as
an
altar
,
as
was
*NL*
evident
from
the
cross
which
still
surmounted
them
.
A
lamp
,
placed
at
*NL*
the
base
of
a
pillar
,
lighted
up
with
its
pale
and
flickering
flame
the
*NL*
singular
scene
which
presented
itself
to
the
eyes
of
the
two
visitors
*NL*
concealed
in
the
shadow
.
A
man
was
seated
with
his
elbow
leaning
on
the
*NL*
column
,
and
was
reading
with
his
back
turned
to
the
arcades
,
through
the
*NL*
openings
of
which
the
new-comers
contemplated
him
.
This
was
the
chief
*NL*
of
the
band
,
Luigi
Vampa
.
Around
him
,
and
in
groups
,
according
to
their
*NL*
fancy
,
lying
in
their
mantles
,
or
with
their
backs
against
a
sort
of
*NL*
stone
bench
,
which
went
all
round
the
columbarium
,
were
to
be
seen
*NL*
twenty
brigands
or
more
,
each
having
his
carbine
within
reach
.
At
the
*NL*
other
end
,
silent
,
scarcely
visible
,
and
like
a
shadow
,
was
a
*NL*
sentinel
,
who
was
walking
up
and
down
before
a
grotto
,
which
was
only
*NL*
distinguishable
because
in
that
spot
the
darkness
seemed
more
dense
than
*NL*
elsewhere
.
When
the
count
thought
Franz
had
gazed
sufficiently
on
this
*NL*
picturesque
tableau
,
he
raised
his
finger
to
his
lips
,
to
warn
him
to
be
*NL*
silent
,
and
,
ascending
the
three
steps
which
led
to
the
corridor
of
*NL*
the
columbarium
,
entered
the
chamber
by
the
middle
arcade
,
and
advanced
*NL*
towards
Vampa
,
who
was
so
intent
on
the
book
before
him
that
he
did
not
*NL*
hear
the
noise
of
his
footsteps
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
comes
there
?
''
cried
the
sentinel
,
who
was
less
abstracted
,
and
who
*NL*
saw
by
the
lamp-light
a
shadow
approaching
his
chief
.
At
this
challenge
,
*NL*
Vampa
rose
quickly
,
drawing
at
the
same
moment
a
pistol
from
his
girdle
.
*NL*
In
a
moment
all
the
bandits
were
on
their
feet
,
and
twenty
carbines
were
*NL*
levelled
at
the
count
.
``
Well
,
''
said
he
in
a
voice
perfectly
calm
,
and
no
*NL*
muscle
of
his
countenance
disturbed
,
``
well
,
my
dear
Vampa
,
it
appears
to
*NL*
me
that
you
receive
a
friend
with
a
great
deal
of
ceremony
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ground
arms
,
''
exclaimed
the
chief
,
with
an
imperative
sign
of
the
hand
,
*NL*
while
with
the
other
he
took
off
his
hat
respectfully
;
then
,
turning
to
*NL*
the
singular
personage
who
had
caused
this
scene
,
he
said
,
``
Your
pardon
,
*NL*
your
excellency
,
but
I
was
so
far
from
expecting
the
honor
of
a
visit
,
*NL*
that
I
did
not
really
recognize
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
seems
that
your
memory
is
equally
short
in
everything
,
Vampa
,
''
said
*NL*
the
count
,
``
and
that
not
only
do
you
forget
people
's
faces
,
but
also
the
*NL*
conditions
you
make
with
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
conditions
have
I
forgotten
,
your
excellency
?
''
inquired
the
*NL*
bandit
,
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
,
having
committed
an
error
,
is
anxious
*NL*
to
repair
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
it
not
agreed
,
''
asked
the
count
,
``
that
not
only
my
person
,
but
also
*NL*
that
of
my
friends
,
should
be
respected
by
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
have
I
broken
that
treaty
,
your
excellency
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
this
evening
carried
off
and
conveyed
hither
the
Vicomte
*NL*
Albert
de
Morcerf
.
Well
,
''
continued
the
count
,
in
a
tone
that
made
*NL*
Franz
shudder
,
``
this
young
gentleman
is
one
of
my
friends
--
this
young
*NL*
gentleman
lodges
in
the
same
hotel
as
myself
--
this
young
gentleman
has
*NL*
been
up
and
down
the
Corso
for
eight
hours
in
my
private
carriage
,
and
*NL*
yet
,
I
repeat
to
you
,
you
have
carried
him
off
,
and
conveyed
him
hither
,
*NL*
and
,
''
added
the
count
,
taking
the
letter
from
his
pocket
,
``
you
have
set
*NL*
a
ransom
on
him
,
as
if
he
were
an
utter
stranger
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
did
you
not
tell
me
all
this
--
you
?
''
inquired
the
brigand
chief
,
*NL*
turning
towards
his
men
,
who
all
retreated
before
his
look
.
``
Why
have
*NL*
you
caused
me
thus
to
fail
in
my
word
towards
a
gentleman
like
the
*NL*
count
,
who
has
all
our
lives
in
his
hands
?
By
heavens
,
if
I
thought
one
*NL*
of
you
knew
that
the
young
gentleman
was
the
friend
of
his
excellency
,
I
*NL*
would
blow
his
brains
out
with
my
own
hand
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
the
count
,
turning
towards
Franz
,
``
I
told
you
there
was
*NL*
some
mistake
in
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
not
alone
?
''
asked
Vampa
with
uneasiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
with
the
person
to
whom
this
letter
was
addressed
,
and
to
whom
*NL*
I
desired
to
prove
that
Luigi
Vampa
was
a
man
of
his
word
.
Come
,
your
*NL*
excellency
,
''
the
count
added
,
turning
to
Franz
,
``
here
is
Luigi
Vampa
,
*NL*
who
will
himself
express
to
you
his
deep
regret
at
the
mistake
he
has
*NL*
committed
.
''
Franz
approached
,
the
chief
advancing
several
steps
to
meet
*NL*
him
.
``
Welcome
among
us
,
your
excellency
,
''
he
said
to
him
;
``
you
heard
*NL*
what
the
count
just
said
,
and
also
my
reply
;
let
me
add
that
I
would
*NL*
not
for
the
four
thousand
piastres
at
which
I
had
fixed
your
friend
's
*NL*
ransom
,
that
this
had
happened
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
''
said
Franz
,
looking
round
him
uneasily
,
``
where
is
the
*NL*
Viscount
?
--
I
do
not
see
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
has
happened
to
him
,
I
hope
,
''
said
the
count
frowningly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
prisoner
is
there
,
''
replied
Vampa
,
pointing
to
the
hollow
space
in
*NL*
front
of
which
the
bandit
was
on
guard
,
``
and
I
will
go
myself
and
tell
*NL*
him
he
is
free
.
''
The
chief
went
towards
the
place
he
had
pointed
out
*NL*
as
Albert
's
prison
,
and
Franz
and
the
count
followed
him
.
``
What
is
the
*NL*
prisoner
doing
?
''
inquired
Vampa
of
the
sentinel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ma
foi
,
captain
,
''
replied
the
sentry
,
``
I
do
not
know
;
for
the
last
hour
*NL*
I
have
not
heard
him
stir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
in
,
your
excellency
,
''
said
Vampa
.
The
count
and
Franz
ascended
*NL*
seven
or
eight
steps
after
the
chief
,
who
drew
back
a
bolt
and
opened
*NL*
a
door
.
Then
,
by
the
gleam
of
a
lamp
,
similar
to
that
which
lighted
the
*NL*
columbarium
,
Albert
was
to
be
seen
wrapped
up
in
a
cloak
which
one
of
*NL*
the
bandits
had
lent
him
,
lying
in
a
corner
in
profound
slumber
.
``
Come
,
''
*NL*
said
the
count
,
smiling
with
his
own
peculiar
smile
,
``
not
so
bad
for
a
*NL*
man
who
is
to
be
shot
at
seven
o'clock
to-morrow
morning
.
''
Vampa
looked
*NL*
at
Albert
with
a
kind
of
admiration
;
he
was
not
insensible
to
such
a
*NL*
proof
of
courage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
right
,
your
excellency
,
''
he
said
;
``
this
must
be
one
of
your
*NL*
friends
.
''
Then
going
to
Albert
,
he
touched
him
on
the
shoulder
,
saying
,
*NL*
``
Will
your
excellency
please
to
awaken
?
''
Albert
stretched
out
his
arms
,
*NL*
rubbed
his
eyelids
,
and
opened
his
eyes
.
``
Oh
,
''
said
he
,
``
is
it
you
,
*NL*
captain
?
You
should
have
allowed
me
to
sleep
.
I
had
such
a
delightful
*NL*
dream
.
I
was
dancing
the
galop
at
Torlonia
's
with
the
Countess
G
--
.
''
*NL*
Then
he
drew
his
watch
from
his
pocket
,
that
he
might
see
how
time
sped
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Half-past
one
only
?
''
said
he
.
``
Why
the
devil
do
you
rouse
me
at
this
*NL*
hour
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
tell
you
that
you
are
free
,
your
excellency
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
fellow
,
''
replied
Albert
,
with
perfect
ease
of
mind
,
``
remember
,
*NL*
for
the
future
,
Napoleon
's
maxim
,
`
Never
awaken
me
but
for
bad
news

'
if
*NL*
you
had
let
me
sleep
on
,
I
should
have
finished
my
galop
,
and
have
been
*NL*
grateful
to
you
all
my
life
.
So
,
then
,
they
have
paid
my
ransom
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
your
excellency
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
how
am
I
free
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
person
to
whom
I
can
refuse
nothing
has
come
to
demand
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
hither
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
hither
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
?
Then
that
person
is
a
most
amiable
person

''
Albert
looked
*NL*
around
and
perceived
Franz
.
``
What
,
''
said
he
,
``
is
it
you
,
my
dear
Franz
,
*NL*
whose
devotion
and
friendship
are
thus
displayed
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
not
I
,
''
replied
Franz
,
``
but
our
neighbor
,
the
Count
of
Monte
*NL*
Cristo
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
dear
count
,
''
said
Albert
gayly
,
arranging
his
cravat
and
*NL*
wristbands
,
``
you
are
really
most
kind
,
and
I
hope
you
will
consider
*NL*
me
as
under
eternal
obligations
to
you
,
in
the
first
place
for
the
*NL*
carriage
,
and
in
the
next
for
this
visit
,
''
and
he
put
out
his
hand
to
*NL*
the
Count
,
who
shuddered
as
he
gave
his
own
,
but
who
nevertheless
did
*NL*
give
it
.
The
bandit
gazed
on
this
scene
with
amazement
;
he
was
evidently
*NL*
accustomed
to
see
his
prisoners
tremble
before
him
,
and
yet
here
was
one
*NL*
whose
gay
temperament
was
not
for
a
moment
altered
;
as
for
Franz
,
he
was
*NL*
enchanted
at
the
way
in
which
Albert
had
sustained
the
national
honor
in
*NL*
the
presence
of
the
bandit
.
``
My
dear
Albert
,
''
he
said
,
``
if
you
will
make
*NL*
haste
,
we
shall
yet
have
time
to
finish
the
night
at
Torlonia
's

You
*NL*
may
conclude
your
interrupted
galop
,
so
that
you
will
owe
no
ill-will
to
*NL*
Signor
Luigi
,
who
has
,
indeed
,
throughout
this
whole
affair
acted
like
a
*NL*
gentleman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
decidedly
right
,
and
we
may
reach
the
Palazzo
by
two
o'clock
.
*NL*
Signor
Luigi

''
continued
Albert
,
``
is
there
any
formality
to
fulfil
*NL*
before
I
take
leave
of
your
excellency

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
None

''
replied
the
bandit
,
``
you
are
as
free
as
air

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

And
Albert
,
followed
by
Franz
and
the
count
,
descended
the
staircase
,
*NL*
crossed
the
square
chamber
,
where
stood
all
the
bandits
,
hat
in
hand
.
*NL*
``
Peppino
,
''
said
the
brigand
chief
,
``
give
me
the
torch

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
going
to
do
?
''
inquired
the
count
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
show
you
the
way
back
myself
,
''
said
the
captain
;
``
that
is
*NL*
the
least
honor
that
I
can
render
to
your
excellency
.
''
And
taking
the
*NL*
lighted
torch
from
the
hands
of
the
herdsman
,
he
preceded
his
guests
,
*NL*
not
as
a
servant
who
performs
an
act
of
civility
,
but
like
a
king
who
*NL*
precedes
ambassadors
.
On
reaching
the
door
,
he
bowed
.
``
And
now
,
your
*NL*
excellency
,
''
added
he
,
``
allow
me
to
repeat
my
apologies
,
and
I
hope
you
*NL*
will
not
entertain
any
resentment
at
what
has
occurred
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
my
dear
Vampa
,
''
replied
the
count
;
``
besides
,
you
compensate
for
*NL*
your
mistakes
in
so
gentlemanly
a
way
,
that
one
almost
feels
obliged
to
*NL*
you
for
having
committed
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gentlemen
,
''
added
the
chief
,
turning
towards
the
young
men
,
``
perhaps
*NL*
the
offer
may
not
appear
very
tempting
to
you
;
but
if
you
should
ever
*NL*
feel
inclined
to
pay
me
a
second
visit
,
wherever
I
may
be
,
you
shall
be
*NL*
welcome

Franz
and
Albert
bowed
.
The
count
went
out
first
,
then
Albert
.
*NL*
Franz
paused
for
a
moment
.
``
Has
your
excellency
anything
to
ask
me
?
''
*NL*
said
Vampa
with
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
have
,
''
replied
Franz
;
``
I
am
curious
to
know
what
work
you
were
*NL*
perusing
with
so
much
attention
as
we
entered
.

*NL*
*NL*
``

the

,
``
it
is

*NL*
``
Well
,
are
you
coming

asked
Albert

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

''
replied
Franz
,
``
here
I

''
and
he
,
in
his
turn
,
left
the
caves
.
*NL*
They
advanced
to
the
plain
.
``
Ah
,
your
pardon
,
''
said
Albert
,
turning
*NL*
round
;
``
will
you
allow
me

?

And
he
lighted
his
cigar
at
Vampa
's
*NL*
torch
.
``
Now
,
my
dear
count
,
''
he
said
,
``
let
us
on
with
all
the
speed
*NL*
we
may
.
I
am
enormously
anxious
to
finish
my
night
at
the
Duke
of
*NL*
Bracciano

.
''
They
found
the
carriage
where
they
had
left
it
.
The
count
*NL*
said
a
word
in
Arabic
to
Ali
,
and
the
horses
went
on
at
great
speed
.
It
*NL*
was
just
two
o'clock
by
Albert
's
watch
when
the
two
friends
entered
into
*NL*
the
dancing-room
.
Their
return
was
quite
an
event
,
but
as
they
entered
*NL*
together
,
all
uneasiness
on
Albert
's
account
ceased
instantly
.
``
Madame
,
''
*NL*
said
the
Viscount
of
Morcerf
,
advancing
towards
the
countess
,
``
yesterday
*NL*
you
were
so
condescending
as
to
promise
me
a
galop
;
I
am
rather
late
in
*NL*
claiming
this
gracious
promise
,
but
here
is
my
friend
,
whose
character
*NL*
for
veracity
you
well
know
,
and
he
will
assure
you
the
delay
arose
from
*NL*
no
fault
of
mine
.
''
And
as
at
this
moment
the
orchestra
gave
the
signal
*NL*
for
the
waltz
,
Albert
put
his
arm
round
the
waist
of
the
countess
,
and
*NL*
disappeared
with
her
in
the
whirl
of
dancers
.
In
the
meanwhile
Franz
was
*NL*
considering
the
singular
shudder
that
had
passed
over
the
Count
of
Monte
*NL*
Cristo
at
the
moment
when
he
had
been
,
in
some
sort
,
forced
to
give
his
*NL*
hand
to
Albert

The
Compact
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
words
that
Albert
uttered
to
his
friend
,
on
the
following
*NL*
morning
,
contained
a
request
that
Franz
would
accompany
him
on
a
visit
*NL*
to
the
count
;
true
,
the
young
man
had
warmly
and
energetically
thanked
*NL*
the
count
on
the
previous
evening
;
but
services
such
as
he
had
rendered
*NL*
could
never
be
too
often
acknowledged
.
Franz
,
who
seemed
attracted
*NL*
by
some
invisible
influence
towards
the
count
,
in
which
terror
was
*NL*
strangely
mingled
,
felt
an
extreme
reluctance
to
permit
his
friend
to
be
*NL*
exposed
alone
to
the
singular
fascination
that
this
mysterious
personage
*NL*
seemed
to
exercise
over
him
,
and
therefore
made
no
objection
to
Albert
's
*NL*
request
,
but
at
once
accompanied
him
to
the
desired
spot
,
and
,
after
a
*NL*
short
delay
,
the
count
joined
them
in
the
salon
.
``
My
dear
count
,
''
said
*NL*
Albert
,
advancing
to
meet
him
,
``
permit
me
to
repeat
the
poor
thanks
I
*NL*
offered
last
night
,
and
to
assure
you
that
the
remembrance
of
all
I
owe
*NL*
to
you
will
never
be
effaced
from
my
memory
;
believe
me
,
as
long
as
I
*NL*
live
,
I
shall
never
cease
to
dwell
with
grateful
recollection
on
the
*NL*
prompt
and
important
service
you
rendered
me
;
and
also
to
remember
that
*NL*
to
you
I
am
indebted
even
for
my
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
very
good
friend
and
excellent
neighbor
,
''
replied
the
count
,
with
a
*NL*
smile
,
``
you
really
exaggerate
my
trifling
exertions
.
You
owe
me
nothing
*NL*
but
some
trifle
of
20,000

francs
,
which
you
have
been
saved
out
of
*NL*
your
travelling
expenses
,
so
that
there
is
not
much
of
a
score
between
*NL*
us
;
--
but
you
must
really
permit
me
to
congratulate
you
on
the
ease
and
*NL*
unconcern
with
which
you
resigned
yourself
to
your
fate
,
and
the
perfect
*NL*
indifference
you
manifested
as
to
the
turn
events
might
take
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Upon
my
word
,
''
said
Albert
,
``
I
deserve
no
credit
for
what
I
could
not
*NL*
help
,
namely
,
a
determination
to
take
everything
as
I
found
it
,
and
to
*NL*
let
those
bandits
see
,
that
although
men
get
into
troublesome
scrapes
*NL*
all
over
the
world
,
there
is
no
nation
but
the
French
that
can
smile
*NL*
even
in
the
face
of
grim
Death
himself
.
All
that
,
however
,
has
nothing
*NL*
to
do
with
my
obligations
to
you
,
and
I
now
come
to
ask
you
whether
,
in
*NL*
my
own
person

my
family
,
or
connections
,
I
can
in
any
way
serve
you

*NL*
My
father

the
Comte

of
Spanish
origin

possesses
*NL*
considerable
influence

both
at
the
court
of
France

Madrid

I
*NL*
unhesitatingly
place
the
best
services
of
myself

all
to
whom
my
*NL*
life
is
dear
,
at
your
disposal

*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur

replied
the
count
,
``
your
offer

far
from
*NL*
surprising
me

is
precisely
what
I
expected
from
you

I
accept
it
in
*NL*
the
same
spirit
of
hearty
sincerity
with
which
it
is
made
;
--
nay
,
I
will
*NL*
go
still
further
,
and
say
that
I
had
previously
made
up
my
mind

ask
a
*NL*
great
favor
at
your

*NL*
``
Is
it
possible

exclaimed
Albert
,
``
that
you
have
reached
your

age

I
can
scarcely

credit
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
Nevertheless
,
it
is
quite
true

still

I
agree
with
you
in
thinking

that
my
present
ignorance

the
first
city
in
Europe
is
a
reproach

to
me
in

immediate
correction

in
all

I
should
have
performed
so
important

necessary
a
duty

*NL*
as
that
of
making
myself
acquainted

the
wonders

justly
celebrated
capital

had
I
known
any
person

would
have

introduced
me
into
the
fashionable
world
,
but
unfortunately
I
possessed
*NL*
no
acquaintance
there

of
necessity

was
compelled

abandon
the

idea

*NL*
*NL*
``
So
distinguished
an

cried
Albert

scarcely

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are

kind

as
a
millionaire

I
might
have
become
a
partner
in

the
speculations

M.
Aguado

M.

as
my
motive
in

not
have
been
for
the
pleasure

dabbling
in

stayed
away

favorable
chance

present
itself

carrying

Your

Franz
did
not

the

dropped
a

words

while

speaking

young

watched
him
closely

hoping
to
read
something

his

was
inscrutable

when

as
in

it
was
veiled
in
a
sphinx-like
smile

Albert

delighted

many

the

returning

to
his

pursued
the

addressing
Franz
,

*NL*
``

*NL*
``

the

holding
out
a
hand
to
*NL*
each
of
the
young
men
,
``
allow
me
to
wish
you
both
a

It
was
the
first
time
the
hand
of
Franz
had
come
in
contact
*NL*
with
that
of
the
mysterious
individual
before
him
,
and
unconsciously
he
*NL*
shuddered
at
its
touch
,
for
it
felt
cold
and
icy
as
that
of
a
corpse
.
*NL*
``
Let
us
understand
each
other

said
Albert
;

replied
the
Count
.
The
young
men
then
rose
,
and
bowing
to
the
*NL*
count
,
quitted
the
room
.
``
What
is
the
matter

asked
Albert
of
Franz
,
*NL*
when
they
had
returned
to

than

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will

to
you

Franz
,

the

a
very
*NL*
singular
person

the

fills
me
with
a
thousand
apprehensions

*NL*
*NL*
``
My

exclaimed
Albert
,
``
what
can
there
possibly

to

Why

have
lost

*NL*
*NL*
``
Whether
I
am
in

answered
Franz
,
``
that

the

I

*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen

Franz

said
Albert
;
``
I
am
glad

cold
you
*NL*
are
in
your
bearing
towards
the
count
,
while
he
,
on
the
other
hand
,
has
*NL*
always
been
courtesy
itself
to

Have
you
anything
particular
against

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then

''
Franz
then
related
to
his
friend
the
history
of
his
*NL*
excursion
to
the
Island
of
Monte
Cristo
and
of
his
finding
a
party
of
*NL*
smugglers
there
,
and
the
two
Corsican
bandits
with
them
.
He
dwelt
with
*NL*
considerable
force
and
energy
on
the
almost
magical
hospitality
he
had
*NL*
received
from
the
count
,
and
the
magnificence
of
his
entertainment
*NL*
in
the
grotto
of
the
``
Thousand
and
One
Nights
.
''
He
recounted
,
with
*NL*
circumstantial
exactitude
,
all
the
particulars
of
the
supper
,
the
*NL*
hashish
,
the
statues
,
the
dream
,
and
how
,
at
his
awakening
,
there
*NL*
remained
no
proof
or
trace
of
all
these
events
,
save
the
small
*NL*
yacht
,
seen
in
the
distant
horizon
driving
under
full
sail
toward
*NL*
Porto-Vecchio
.
Then
he
detailed
the
conversation
overheard
by
him
at
the
*NL*
Colosseum
,
between
the
count
and
Vampa
,
in
which
the
count
had
promised
*NL*
to
obtain
the
release
of
the
bandit
Peppino
,
--
an
engagement
which
,
as
*NL*
our
readers
are
aware
,
he
most
faithfully
fulfilled
.
At
last
he
arrived
*NL*
at
the
adventure
of
the
preceding
night
,
and
the
embarrassment
in
which
*NL*
he
found
himself
placed
by
not
having
sufficient
cash
by
six
or
seven
*NL*
hundred
piastres
to
make
up
the
sum
required
,
and
finally
of
his
*NL*
application
to
the
count
and
the
picturesque
and
satisfactory
result
*NL*
that
followed
.
Albert
listened
with
the
most
profound
attention
.
``
Well
,
''
*NL*
said
he
,
when
Franz
had
concluded
,
``
what
do
you
find
to
object
to
in
*NL*
all
you
have
related
?
The
count
is
fond
of
travelling
,
and
,
being
rich
,
*NL*
possesses
a
vessel
of
his
own
.
Go
but
to
Portsmouth
or
Southampton
,
and
*NL*
you
will
find
the
harbors
crowded
with
the
yachts
belonging
to
such
of
*NL*
the
English
as
can
afford
the
expense
,
and
have
the
same
liking
for
this
*NL*
amusement
.
Now
,
by
way
of
having
a
resting-place
during
his
excursions
,
*NL*
avoiding
the
wretched
cookery
--
which
has
been
trying
its
best
to
poison
*NL*
me
during
the
last
four
months
,
while
you
have
manfully
resisted
its
*NL*
effects
for
as
many
years
,
--
and
obtaining
a
bed
on
which
it
is
possible
*NL*
to
slumber
,
Monte
Cristo
has
furnished
for
himself
a
temporary
abode
*NL*
where
you
first
found
him
;
but
,
to
prevent
the
possibility
of
the
Tuscan
*NL*
government
taking
a
fancy
to
his
enchanted
palace
,
and
thereby
depriving
*NL*
him
of
the
advantages
naturally
expected
from
so
large
an
outlay
of
*NL*
capital
,
he
has
wisely
enough
purchased
the
island
,
and
taken
its
name
.
*NL*
Just
ask
yourself
,
my
good
fellow
,
whether
there
are
not
many
persons
of
*NL*
our
acquaintance
who
assume
the
names
of
lands
and
properties
they
never
*NL*
in
their
lives
were
masters
of
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
''
said
Franz
,
``
the
Corsican
bandits
that
were
among
the
crew
of
his
*NL*
vessel
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
really
the
thing
seems
to
me
simple
enough
.
Nobody
knows
better
*NL*
than
yourself
that
the
bandits
of
Corsica
are
not
rogues
or
thieves
,
but
*NL*
purely
and
simply
fugitives
,
driven
by
some
sinister
motive
from
their
*NL*
native
town
or
village
,
and
that
their
fellowship
involves
no
disgrace
*NL*
or
stigma
;
for
my
own
part
,
I
protest
that
,
should
I
ever
go
to
Corsica
,
*NL*
my
first
visit
,
ere
even
I
presented
myself
to
the
mayor
or
prefect
,
*NL*
should
be
to
the
bandits
of
Colomba
,
if
I
could
only
manage
to
find
*NL*
them
;
for
,
on
my
conscience
,
they
are
a
race
of
men
I
admire
greatly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Still
,
''
persisted
Franz
,
``
I
suppose
you
will
allow
that
such
men
as
*NL*
Vampa
and
his
band
are
regular
villains
,
who
have
no
other
motive
than
*NL*
plunder
when
they
seize
your
person
.
How
do
you
explain
the
influence
*NL*
the
count
evidently
possessed
over
those
ruffians
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
good
friend
,
as
in
all
probability
I
own
my
present
safety
to
that
*NL*
influence
,
it
would
ill
become
me
to
search
too
closely
into
its
source
;
*NL*
therefore
,
instead
of
condemning
him
for
his
intimacy
with
outlaws
,
you
*NL*
must
give
me
leave
to
excuse
any
little
irregularity
there
may
be
in
*NL*
such
a
connection
;
not
altogether
for
preserving
my
life
,
for
my
own
*NL*
idea
was
that
it
never
was
in
much
danger
,
but
certainly
for
saving
me
*NL*
4,000
piastres
,
which
,
being
translated
,
means
neither
more
nor
less
*NL*
than
24,000
livres
of
our
money
--
a
sum
at
which
,
most
assuredly
,
I
*NL*
should
never
have
been
estimated
in
France
,
proving
most
indisputably
,
''
*NL*
added
Albert
with
a
laugh
,
``
that
no
prophet
is
honored
in
his
own
*NL*
country
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Talking
of
countries
,
''
replied
Franz
,
``
of
what
country
is
the
count
,
*NL*
what
is
his
native
tongue
,
whence
does
he
derive
his
immense
fortune
,
*NL*
and
what
were
those
events
of
his
early
life
--
a
life
as
marvellous
*NL*
as
unknown
--
that
have
tinctured
his
succeeding
years
with
so
dark
and
*NL*
gloomy
a
misanthropy
?
Certainly
these
are
questions
that
,
in
your
place
,
*NL*
I
should
like
to
have
answered

*NL*
*NL*
``
My

replied
Albert
,
``

,
upon
receipt

letter

you

the
necessity

you
promptly
went

to

saying

was

*NL*
come
by
his
name
--
his
fortune

what
are
his
means
of
existence
?
what
is
*NL*
his
birthplace
!
of
what
country
is
he
a
native
?

Tell
me

did
he
put
all
*NL*
these
questions
to
you

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
confess
he
asked
me
none

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

he
merely
came
and
freed
me
from
the
hands
of
Signor
Vampa
,
where
,
*NL*
I
can
assure
you
,
in
spite
of
all
my
outward
appearance
of
ease
and
*NL*
unconcern
,
I
did
not
very
particularly
care
to
remain
.
Now
,
then
,
Franz
,
*NL*
when
,
for
services
so
promptly
and
unhesitatingly
rendered
,
he
but
asks

me
in

do
for
him
what
is
done
daily
for
any
Russian
prince

Italian
nobleman
who
may
pass
through
Paris
--
merely
to
introduce
him
*NL*
into
society
--
would
you
have
me
refuse
?
My
good
fellow
,
you
must
have
*NL*
lost
your
senses
to
think
it
possible
I
could
act
with
such
cold-blooded
*NL*
policy

And
this
time
it
must
be
confessed
that
,
contrary
to
the
usual
*NL*
state
of
affairs
in
discussions
between
the
young
men
,
the
effective
*NL*
arguments
were
all
on
Albert

side

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

said
Franz
with
a
sigh
,
``
do
as
you
please
my
dear
viscount

your
arguments
are
beyond
my
powers

Still
,
in
spite
of
*NL*
all
,
you
must
admit

this
Count

is
a
most
singular
*NL*
personage

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
a
philanthropist

answered
the
other
;
``
and
no
doubt
his
motive

is
to
compete

you

are
aware

to
whoever
shall
be
proved

materially
advanced

the
interests

If

interest
can
obtain
*NL*
it
for

I
will
readily
give
him
the
one

promise

And
*NL*
now
,
my

let
us
talk

something
else

Come

shall
we
take

our
luncheon

and
then
pay
a
last
visit
to
St.
Peter

Franz
silently
*NL*
assented
;
and
the
following
afternoon
,
at
half-past
five
o'clock
,
*NL*
the
young
men
parted

Albert
de
Morcerf
to
return
to
Paris

pass
a
fortnight
at
Venice

But
,
ere
he
entered
his
*NL*
travelling
carriage
,
Albert
,
fearing
that
his
expected
guest
might
*NL*
forget
the
engagement
he
had
entered
into
,
placed
in
the
care
of
a
*NL*
waiter
at
the
hotel
a
card
to
be
delivered
to
the
Count
of
Monte
Cristo
,
*NL*
on
which
,
beneath
the
name
of
Vicomte
Albert
de

,
he
had
written
*NL*
in
pencil
--

The
Guests
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
house
in
the
Rue
du
Helder
,
where
Albert
had
invited
the
Count
of
*NL*
Monte
Cristo
,
everything
was
being
prepared
on
the
morning
of
the
*NL*
21st
of
May
to
do
honor
to
the
occasion
.
Albert
de
Morcerf
inhabited
a
*NL*
pavilion
situated
at
the
corner
of
a
large
court
,
and
directly
opposite
*NL*
another
building
,
in
which
were
the
servants
'
apartments
.
Two
windows
*NL*
only
of
the
pavilion
faced
the
street
;
three
other
windows
looked
into
*NL*
the
court
,
and
two
at
the
back
into
the
garden
.
Between
the
court
and
*NL*
the
garden
,
built
in
the
heavy
style
of
the
imperial
architecture
,
was
*NL*
the
large
and
fashionable
dwelling
of
the
Count
and
Countess
of
Morcerf
.
*NL*
A
high
wall
surrounded
the
whole
of
the
hotel
,
surmounted
at
intervals
*NL*
by
vases
filled
with
flowers
,
and
broken
in
the
centre
by
a
large
gate
*NL*
of
gilded
iron
,
which
served
as
the
carriage
entrance
.
A
small
door
,
*NL*
close
to
the
lodge
of
the
concierge
,
gave
ingress
and
egress
to
the
*NL*
servants
and
masters
when
they
were
on
foot
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
easy
to
discover
that
the
delicate
care
of
a
mother
,
unwilling
to
*NL*
part
from
her
son
,
and
yet
aware
that
a
young
man
of
the
viscount
's
age
*NL*
required
the
full
exercise
of
his
liberty
,
had
chosen
this
habitation
*NL*
for
Albert
.
There
were
not
lacking
,
however
,
evidences
of
what
we
may
*NL*
call
the
intelligent
egoism
of
a
youth
who
is
charmed
with
the
indolent
,
*NL*
careless
life
of
an
only
son
,
and
who
lives
as
it
were
in
a
gilded
cage
.
*NL*
By
means
of
the
two
windows
looking
into
the
street
,
Albert
could
see
*NL*
all
that
passed
;
the
sight
of
what
is
going
on
is
necessary
to
young
*NL*
men
,
who
always
want
to
see
the
world
traverse
their
horizon
,
even
if
*NL*
that
horizon
is
only
a
public
thoroughfare
.
Then
,
should
anything
appear
*NL*
to
merit
a
more
minute
examination
,
Albert
de
Morcerf
could
follow
up
*NL*
his
researches
by
means
of
a
small
gate
,
similar
to
that
close
to
the
*NL*
concierge
's
door
,
and
which
merits
a
particular
description
.
It
was
a
*NL*
little
entrance
that
seemed
never
to
have
been
opened
since
the
house
*NL*
was
built
,
so
entirely
was
it
covered
with
dust
and
dirt
;
but
the
*NL*
well-oiled
hinges
and
locks
told
quite
another
story
.
This
door
was
a
*NL*
mockery
to
the
concierge
,
from
whose
vigilance
and
jurisdiction
it
was
*NL*
free
,
and
,
like
that
famous
portal
in
the
``
Arabian
Nights
,
''
opening
at
*NL*
the
``
Sesame
''
of
Ali
Baba
,
it
was
wont
to
swing
backward
at
a
cabalistic
*NL*
word
or
a
concerted
tap
from
without
from
the
sweetest
voices
or
whitest
*NL*
fingers
in
the
world
.
At
the
end
of
a
long
corridor
,
with
which
the
*NL*
door
communicated
,
and
which
formed
the
ante-chamber
,
was
,
on
the
right
,
*NL*
Albert
's
breakfast-room
,
looking
into
the
court
,
and
on
the
left
the
*NL*
salon
,
looking
into
the
garden
.
Shrubs
and
creeping
plants
covered
the
*NL*
windows
,
and
hid
from
the
garden
and
court
these
two
apartments
,
the
*NL*
only
rooms
into
which
,
as
they
were
on
the
ground-floor
,
the
prying
eyes
*NL*
of
the
curious
could
penetrate
.
On
the
floor
above
were
similar
rooms
,
*NL*
with
the
addition
of
a
third
,
formed
out
of
the
ante-chamber
;
*NL*
these
three
rooms
were
a
salon
,
a
boudoir
,
and
a
bedroom
.
The
salon
*NL*
down-stairs
was
only
an
Algerian
divan
,
for
the
use
of
smokers
.
The
*NL*
boudoir
up-stairs
communicated
with
the
bed-chamber
by
an
invisible
door
*NL*
on
the
staircase
;
it
was
evident
that
every
precaution
had
been
taken
.
*NL*
Above
this
floor
was
a
large
atelier
,
which
had
been
increased
in
size
*NL*
by
pulling
down
the
partitions
--
a
pandemonium
,
in
which
the
artist
and
*NL*
the
dandy
strove
for
preeminence
.
There
were
collected
and
piled
up
all
*NL*
Albert
's
successive
caprices
,
hunting-horns
,
bass-viols
,
flutes
--
a
whole
*NL*
orchestra
,
for
Albert
had
had
not
a
taste
but
a
fancy
for
music
;
easels
,
*NL*
palettes
,
brushes
,
pencils
--
for
music
had
been
succeeded
by
painting
;
*NL*
foils
,
boxing-gloves
,
broadswords
,
and
single-sticks
--
for
,
following
*NL*
the
example
of
the
fashionable
young
men
of
the
time
,
Albert
de
Morcerf
*NL*
cultivated
,
with
far
more
perseverance
than
music
and
drawing
,
the
*NL*
three
arts
that
complete
a
dandy
's
education
,
i.e.
,
fencing
,
boxing
,
*NL*
and
single-stick
;
and
it
was
here
that
he
received
Grisier
,
Cook
,
*NL*
and
Charles
Leboucher
.
The
rest
of
the
furniture
of
this
privileged
*NL*
apartment
consisted
of
old
cabinets
,
filled
with
Chinese
porcelain
and
*NL*
Japanese
vases
,
Lucca
della
Robbia
faience
,
and
Palissy
platters
;
of
old
*NL*
arm-chairs
,
in
which
perhaps
had
sat
Henry
IV
.
or
Sully
,
Louis
XIII
.
or
*NL*
Richelieu
--
for
two
of
these
arm-chairs
,
adorned
with
a
carved
shield
,
*NL*
on
which
were
engraved
the
fleur-de-lis
of
France
on
an
azure
field
*NL*
evidently
came
from
the
Louvre
,
or
,
at
least
,
some
royal
residence
.
Over
*NL*
these
dark
and
sombre
chairs
were
thrown
splendid
stuffs
,
dyed
beneath
*NL*
Persia
's
sun
,
or
woven
by
the
fingers
of
the
women
of
Calcutta
or
of
*NL*
Chandernagor
.
What
these
stuffs
did
there
,
it
was
impossible
to
say
;
*NL*
they
awaited
,
while
gratifying
the
eyes
,
a
destination
unknown
to
their
*NL*
owner
himself
;
in
the
meantime
they
filled
the
place
with
their
golden
*NL*
and
silky
reflections
.
In
the
centre
of
the
room
was
a
Roller
and
*NL*
Blanchet
``
baby
grand
''
piano
in
rosewood
,
but
holding
the
potentialities
*NL*
of
an
orchestra
in
its
narrow
and
sonorous
cavity
,
and
groaning
beneath
*NL*
the
weight
of
the
chefs-d'oeuvre
of
Beethoven
,
Weber
,
Mozart
,
Haydn
,
*NL*
Gretry
,
and
Porpora
.
On
the
walls
,
over
the
doors
,
on
the
ceiling
,
were
*NL*
swords
,
daggers
,
Malay
creeses
,
maces
,
battle-axes
;
gilded
,
damasked
,
*NL*
and
inlaid
suits
of
armor
;
dried
plants
,
minerals
,
and
stuffed
birds
,
*NL*
their
flame-colored
wings
outspread
in
motionless
flight
,
and
their
*NL*
beaks
forever
open
.
This
was
Albert
's
favorite
lounging
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
the
morning
of
the
appointment
,
the
young
man
had
established
*NL*
himself
in
the
small
salon
down-stairs
.
There
,
on
a
table
,
surrounded
at
*NL*
some
distance
by
a
large
and
luxurious
divan
,
every
species
of
tobacco
*NL*
known
,
--
from
the
yellow
tobacco
of
Petersburg
to
the
black
of
Sinai
,
*NL*
and
so
on
along
the
scale
from
Maryland
and
Porto-Rico
,
to
Latakia
,
--
was
*NL*
exposed
in
pots
of
crackled
earthenware
of
which
the
Dutch
are
so
fond
;
*NL*
beside
them
,
in
boxes
of
fragrant
wood
,
were
ranged
,
according
to
their
*NL*
size
and
quality
,
pueros
,
regalias
,
havanas
,
and
manillas
;
and
,
in
an
*NL*
open
cabinet
,
a
collection
of
German
pipes
,
of
chibouques
,
with
their
*NL*
amber
mouth-pieces
ornamented
with
coral
,
and
of
narghiles
,
with
their
*NL*
long
tubes
of
morocco
,
awaiting
the
caprice
or
the
sympathy
of
the
*NL*
smokers
.
Albert
had
himself
presided
at
the
arrangement
,
or
,
rather
,
the
*NL*
symmetrical
derangement
,
which
,
after
coffee
,
the
guests
at
a
breakfast
*NL*
of
modern
days
love
to
contemplate
through
the
vapor
that
escapes
from
*NL*
their
mouths
,
and
ascends
in
long
and
fanciful
wreaths
to
the
ceiling
.
*NL*
At
a
quarter
to
ten
,
a
valet
entered
;
he
composed
,
with
a
little
groom
*NL*
named
John
,
and
who
only
spoke
English
,
all
Albert
's
establishment
,
*NL*
although
the
cook
of
the
hotel
was
always
at
his
service
,
and
on
great
*NL*
occasions
the
count
's
chasseur
also
.
This
valet
,
whose
name
was
Germain
,
*NL*
and
who
enjoyed
the
entire
confidence
of
his
young
master
,
held
in
one
*NL*
hand
a
number
of
papers
,
and
in
the
other
a
packet
of
letters
,
which
*NL*
he
gave
to
Albert
.
Albert
glanced
carelessly
at
the
different
missives
,
*NL*
selected
two
written
in
a
small
and
delicate
hand
,
and
enclosed
in
*NL*
scented
envelopes
,
opened
them
and
perused
their
contents
with
some
*NL*
attention
.
``
How
did
these
letters
come
?
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
by
the
post
,
Madame
Danglars

the
other
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
Madame
Danglars
know
that
I
accept
the
place

offers
me

,
during
the
day
,
tell
Rosa
that

I
leave

will

Take

-LRB-
Albert
looked
at
his
tablets
-RRB-
,
``

is
the
*NL*

told
the

I
do
not

much

I

*NL*
*NL*
``
If

I
will
inquire

*NL*
*NL*
``

have
the
honor
of
seeing

about
three
o'clock
,
and
*NL*
that
I
request
permission
to
introduce
some
one
to
her
.
''
The
valet
left
*NL*
the
room
.
Albert
threw
himself
on
the
divan
,
tore
off
the
cover
of
two
*NL*
or
three
of
the
papers
,
looked
at
the
theatre
announcements
,
made
a
face
*NL*
seeing
they
gave
an
opera
,
and
not
a
ballet
;
hunted
vainly
amongst
the
*NL*
advertisements
for
a
new
tooth-powder
of
which
he
had
heard
,
and
threw
*NL*
down
,
one
after
the
other
,
the
three
leading
papers
of
Paris
,
muttering
,
*NL*
``
These
papers
become
more
and
more
stupid
every
day

''
A
moment
after
,
*NL*
a
carriage
stopped
before
the
door
,
and
the
servant
announced
M.
Lucien
*NL*
Debray
.
A
tall
young
man
,
with
light
hair
,
clear
gray
eyes
,
and
thin
*NL*
and
compressed
lips
,
dressed
in
a
blue
coat
with
beautifully
carved
gold
*NL*
buttons
,
a
white
neckcloth
,
and
a
tortoiseshell
eye-glass
suspended
by
a
*NL*
silken
thread
,
and
which
,
by
an
effort
of
the
superciliary
and
zygomatic
*NL*
muscles
,
he
fixed
in
his
eye
,
entered
,
with
a
half-official
air
,
without
*NL*
smiling
or
speaking
.
``
Good-morning
,
Lucien
,
good-morning

said
Albert
;
*NL*
``
your
punctuality
really
alarms
me

What
do
I
say

punctuality

You

I
expected

,
you
arrive
at
five
minutes
to
ten

Has
the

resigned

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

my

returned
the
young
man
,
seating
himself
on
the
*NL*
divan
;
``
reassure
yourself
;
we
are
tottering
always
,
but
we
never
fall
,
*NL*
and
I
begin
to
believe
that
we
shall
pass
into
a
state
of
immobility
,
*NL*

then
the
affairs
of
the
Peninsula
will
completely
consolidate
us

``
At

Yes

not

*NL*
``
Yes

they

Debray
,

carelessly

*NL*
``
Come

confess

*NL*
``
Oh

so
early

*NL*
``
Because

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

because
I
passed
the
night
writing
letters

five

twenty

I
returned
home
at
daybreak
,
and
strove
to
sleep
;
but
my

head
ached

I
got
up
to
have
a
ride
for
an
hour

At

ennui

attacked

recollected

gave
a

I
wished
to
try
upon

In

I
embarked
for

to
Constantine

I
arrived
just
in

raising

I
retreated
with

for
eight

forty

hours

I
endured
the
rain

the
cold
during

night
tolerably
well

the
third

my

died

cold

brute

accustomed

be

up

have
a

two

I
was

no

the

swung

this

Ah

taken
up

Now

me

shudder

and
one
day
when
we
were
viewing
an
execution

I
thought
I
*NL*
should
faint
,
more
from
hearing
the
cold

calm
manner

*NL*
he
spoke

from
the
sight
of
the

the
culprit

*NL*
*NL*
``
Did

``
Rail

Morcerf

somewhat
*NL*
piqued

and
think
of
this
man

it
seems
to
me
we
are
*NL*
not
of

race
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
highly
flattered
,
''
returned
Beauchamp
.
``
At
the

time
,
''
added
*NL*
Chateau-Renaud
,
``
your
Count
of

is
a
very
fine
fellow

*NL*
always

his

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
no

Debray

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

cried
Beauchamp
.
``
No

Debray

*NL*
``
There
is
half-past

Albert

*NL*
*NL*
``
Confess
you
have
dreamed
this
,
and
let
us
sit
down
to
breakfast

''
*NL*
continued
Beauchamp
.
But
the
sound
of
the
clock
had
not
died
away
when
*NL*
Germain
announced
,
``
His
excellency
the
Count
of
Monte
Cristo
.
''
The
*NL*
involuntary
start
every
one
gave
proved
how
much
Morcerf
's
narrative
*NL*
had
impressed
them
,
and
Albert
himself
could
not
wholly
refrain
from
*NL*
manifesting
sudden
emotion
.
He
had
not
heard
a
carriage
stop
in
the
*NL*
street
,
or
steps
in
the
ante-chamber
;
the
door
had
itself
opened
*NL*
noiselessly
.
The
count
appeared
,
dressed
with
the
greatest
simplicity
,
*NL*
but
the
most
fastidious
dandy
could
have
found
nothing
to
cavil
at
in
*NL*
his
toilet
.
Every
article
of
dress
--
hat
,
coat
,
gloves
,
and
boots
--
was
*NL*
from
the
first
makers
.
He
seemed
scarcely
five
and
thirty
.
But
what
*NL*
struck
everybody
was
his
extreme
resemblance
to
the
portrait
Debray
had
*NL*
drawn
.
The
count
advanced
,
smiling
,
into
the
centre
of
the
room
,
and
*NL*
approached
Albert
,
who
hastened
towards
him
holding
out
his
hand
in
a
*NL*
ceremonial
manner
.
``
Punctuality
,
''
said
Monte
Cristo
,
``
is
the
politeness
*NL*
of
kings
,
according
to
one
of
your
sovereigns
,
I
think
;
but
it
is
not
*NL*
the
same
with
travellers
.
However
,
I
hope
you
will
excuse
the
two
*NL*
or
three
seconds
I
am
behindhand
;
five
hundred
leagues
are
not
to
be
*NL*
accomplished
without
some
trouble
,
and
especially
in
France
,
where
,
it
*NL*
seems
,
it
is
forbidden
to
beat
the
postilions
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
count
,
''
replied
Albert
,
``
I
was
announcing
your
visit
to
some
of
*NL*
my
friends
,
whom
I
had
invited
in
consequence
of
the
promise
you
did
me
*NL*
the
honor
to
make
,
and
whom
I
now
present
to
you
.
They
are
the
Count
of
*NL*
Chateau-Renaud
,
whose
nobility
goes
back
to
the
twelve
peers
,
and
whose
*NL*
ancestors
had
a
place
at
the
Round
Table
;
M.
Lucien
Debray
,
private
*NL*
secretary
to
the
minister
of
the
interior
;
M.
Beauchamp
,
an
editor
of
a
*NL*
paper
,
and
the
terror
of
the
French
government
,
but
of
whom
,
in
spite
of
*NL*
his
national
celebrity
,
you
perhaps
have
not
heard
in
Italy
,
since
his
*NL*
paper
is
prohibited
there
;
and
M.
Maximilian
Morrel
,
captain
of
Spahis
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
name
the
count
,
who
had
hitherto
saluted
every
one
with
*NL*
courtesy
,
but
at
the
same
time
with
coldness
and
formality
,
stepped
a
*NL*
pace
forward
,
and
a
slight
tinge
of
red
colored
his
pale
cheeks
.
``
You
*NL*
wear
the
uniform
of
the
new
French
conquerors
,
monsieur
,
''
said
he
;
``
it
*NL*
is
a
handsome
uniform
.
''
No
one
could
have
said
what
caused
the
count
's
*NL*
voice
to
vibrate
so
deeply
,
and
what
made
his
eye
flash
,
which
was
in
*NL*
general
so
clear
,
lustrous
,
and
limpid
when
he
pleased
.
``
You
have
never
*NL*
seen
our
Africans
,
count
?
''
said
Albert
.
``
Never
,
''
replied
the
count
,
who
*NL*
was
by
this
time
perfectly
master
of
himself
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
beneath
this
uniform
beats
one
of
the
bravest
and
noblest
hearts
*NL*
in
the
whole
army
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
M.
de
Morcerf
,
''
interrupted
Morrel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
go
on
,
captain
.
And
we
have
just
heard
,
''
continued
Albert
,
``
of
*NL*
a
new
deed
of
his
,
and
so
heroic
a
one
,
that
,
although
I
have
seen
him
*NL*
to-day
for
the
first
time
,
I
request
you
to
allow
me
to
introduce
him
*NL*
as
my
friend
.
''
At
these
words
it
was
still
possible
to
observe
in
Monte
*NL*
Cristo
the
concentrated
look
,
changing
color
,
and
slight
trembling
of
*NL*
the
eyelid
that
show
emotion
.
``
Ah
,
you
have
a
noble
heart
,
''
said
the
*NL*
count
;
``
so
much
the
better
.
''
This
exclamation
,
which
corresponded
to
*NL*
the
count
's
own
thought
rather
than
to
what
Albert
was
saying
,
surprised
*NL*
everybody
,
and
especially
Morrel
,
who
looked
at
Monte
Cristo
with
*NL*
wonder
.
But
,
at
the
same
time
,
the
intonation
was
so
soft
that
,
however
*NL*
strange
the
speech
might
seem
,
it
was
impossible
to
be
offended
at
it
.
*NL*
``
Why
should
he
doubt
it
?
''
said
Beauchamp
to
Chateau-Renaud
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
reality
,
''
replied
the
latter
,
who
,
with
his
aristocratic
glance
*NL*
and
his
knowledge
of
the
world
,
had
penetrated
at
once
all
that
was
*NL*
penetrable
in
Monte
Cristo
,
``
Albert
has
not
deceived
us
,
for
the
count
*NL*
is
a
most
singular
being
.
What
say

Morrel
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ma
foi

he
has
an
open
look
about
him

pleases
me

of

*NL*
singular
remark
he
has
made
about
me
.

*NL*
*NL*
``

Albert
,
``

to
show
you
the

''
They
passed
silently
into
*NL*
the
breakfast-room
,
and
every
one
took
his
place
.
``
Gentlemen
,
''
said
the
*NL*
count
,
seating
himself
,
``
permit
me
to
make
a
confession
which
must
form
*NL*
my
excuse
for
any
improprieties
I
may
commit

I
am
a
stranger
,
and
a
*NL*
stranger
to
such
a
degree
,
that
this
is
the
first
time
I
have
ever
been
*NL*
at
Paris
.
The
French
way
of
living
is
utterly
unknown
to
me
,
and
up
to
*NL*
the
present
time
I
have
followed
the
Eastern
customs
,
which
are
entirely
*NL*
in
contrast
to
the
Parisian
.
I
beg
you
,
therefore
,
to
excuse
if
you
find
*NL*
anything
in
me
too
Turkish
,
too
Italian
,
or
too
Arabian

Now

then
,
let
*NL*
us
breakfast

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
what
an
air
he
says
all
this

muttered
Beauchamp
;
``
decidedly
he
*NL*

a
great
man

*NL*
*NL*
``

M.
Debray

said
Chateau-Renaud
.
The
*NL*
count
was
,
it
may
be
remembered
,
a
most
temperate
guest
.
Albert
remarked
*NL*
this
,
expressing
his
fears
lest
,
at
the
outset
,
the
Parisian
mode
of
*NL*
life
should
displease
the
traveller
in
the
most
essential
point
.
``
My
*NL*
dear
count
,
''
said
he
,
``
I
fear
one
thing
,
and
that
is
,
that
the
fare
of

Rue
du

not
so
much
to
your
taste

that
of
the
Piazza

Spagni

I
ought
to
have
consulted
you
on
the
point

have
had
some
*NL*
dishes
prepared
expressly
.

*NL*
``
Did
you
know
me
better

the

``
Would
it
be
an
indiscretion

ask

see

continued
Beauchamp
,
hoping
to
take
him
at
a
disadvantage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
monsieur
,
''
returned
the
count
;
and
he
drew
from
his
pocket
a
*NL*
marvellous
casket
,
formed
out
of
a
single
emerald
and
closed
by
a
golden
*NL*
lid
which
unscrewed
and
gave
passage
to
a
small
greenish
colored
pellet
*NL*
about
the
size
of
a
pea
.
This
ball
had
an
acrid
and
penetrating
odor
.
*NL*
There
were
four
or
five
more
in
the
emerald
,
which
would
contain
about
*NL*
a
dozen
.
The
casket
passed
around
the
table
,
but
it
was
more
to
examine
*NL*
the
admirable
emerald
than
to
see
the
pills
that
it
passed
from
hand
to
*NL*
hand
.
``
And
is
it
your
cook
who
prepares
these
pills
?
''
asked
Beauchamp
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
monsieur

''
replied
Monte
Cristo
;
``
I
do
not
thus
betray
my
*NL*
enjoyments

the
vulgar

am
a
tolerable
chemist

my
pills
*NL*
myself

*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
a
magnificent

the

I

said
*NL*
Chateau-Renaud
,
``
although
my
mother
has
some
remarkable
family
jewels

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
three
similar
ones
,
''
returned
Monte
Cristo
.
``
I
gave
one
to
the
*NL*
Sultan

mounted
it
in
his
sabre

another
to

*NL*
Pope

who
had
it
set
in
his
tiara

opposite
to
one
nearly

not
so
fine

given
by
the
Emperor
Napoleon
to
his
predecessor
,
*NL*
Pius
VII

I
kept
the
third
for
myself
,
and
I
had
it
hollowed
out
,
which
*NL*
reduced
its
value
,
but
rendered
it
more
commodious
for
the
purpose
I
*NL*
intended

''
Every
one
looked
at
Monte
Cristo
with
astonishment
;
he
spoke
*NL*
with
so
much
simplicity
that
it
was
evident
he
spoke
the
truth
,
or
*NL*
that
he
was
mad
.
However
,
the
sight
of
the
emerald
made
them
naturally
*NL*
incline
to
the
former
belief
.
``
And
what
did
these
two
sovereigns
give
*NL*
you
in
exchange
for
these
magnificent
presents

asked
Debray
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Sultan

the
Count

Morcerf

I
had
announced

Morcerf

for

believed
myself
the

the

a
masque

whom
I
took
for
a
descendant
of
Tullia

I
was

just

I

a

placed
a

aided

led

dragged

I
found

perusing

who
deigned
to
leave
off

you
contrived

much

ordinarily
have
so
little
respect

I

*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing

returned
the

``
I
had
known

famous

ten

When

was
quite
a

only
a
shepherd

*NL*
I
gave
him
a
few
gold
pieces
for
showing
me
my
way

he

me

gave
me
a

the

he
had
carved

,
on

it

I

a

I
might

Roman
*NL*
justice

is
somewhat
expeditious
,

which
would
have
been
*NL*
particularly
so
with
him

I
did
nothing

I
suffered
him

depart

With

lent

eighty-five

*NL*

answered
Beauchamp

Although

that

read
it
yourself

passed
a

looked
at

they
did
not
know
if
it
was

every

such

an
air

false

Chateau-Renaud

The
Presentation
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Albert
found
himself
alone
with
Monte
Cristo
,
``
My
dear
count
,
''
*NL*
said
he
,
``
allow
me
to
commence
my
services
as
cicerone
by
showing
you
*NL*
a
specimen
of
a
bachelor
's
apartment
.
You
,
who
are
accustomed
to
the
*NL*
palaces
of
Italy
,
can
amuse
yourself
by
calculating
in
how
many
square
*NL*
feet
a
young
man
who
is
not
the
worst
lodged
in
Paris
can
live
.
As
*NL*
we
pass
from
one
room
to
another
,
I
will
open
the
windows
to
let
you
*NL*
breathe
.
''
Monte
Cristo
had
already
seen
the
breakfast-room
and
the
salon
*NL*
on
the
ground-floor
.
Albert
led
him
first
to
his
atelier
,
which
was
,
as
*NL*
we
have
said
,
his
favorite
apartment
.
Monte
Cristo
quickly
appreciated
*NL*
all
that
Albert
had
collected
here
--
old
cabinets
,
Japanese
porcelain
,
*NL*
Oriental
stuffs
,
Venetian
glass
,
arms
from
all
parts
of
the
*NL*
world
--
everything
was
familiar
to
him
;
and
at
the
first
glance
he
*NL*
recognized
their
date
,
their
country
,
and
their
origin
.
Morcerf
had
*NL*
expected
he
should
be
the
guide
;
on
the
contrary
,
it
was
he
who
,
under
*NL*
the
count
's
guidance
,
followed
a
course
of
archaeology
,
mineralogy
,
and
*NL*
natural
history
.
They
descended
to
the
first
floor
;
Albert
led
his
guest
*NL*
into
the
salon
.
The
salon
was
filled
with
the
works
of
modern
artists
;
*NL*
there
were
landscapes
by
Dupre
,
with
their
long
reeds
and
tall
trees
,
*NL*
their
lowing
oxen
and
marvellous
skies
;
Delacroix
's
Arabian
cavaliers
,
*NL*
with
their
long
white
burnouses
,
their
shining
belts
,
their
damasked
*NL*
arms
,
their
horses
,
who
tore
each
other
with
their
teeth
while
their
*NL*
riders
contended
fiercely
with
their
maces
;
aquarelles
of
Boulanger
,
*NL*
representing
Notre
Dame
de
Paris
with
that
vigor
that
makes
the
artist
*NL*
the
rival
of
the
poet
;
there
were
paintings
by
Diaz
,
who
makes
his
*NL*
flowers
more
beautiful
than
flowers
,
his
suns
more
brilliant
than
the
*NL*
sun
;
designs
by
Decamp
,
as
vividly
colored
as
those
of
Salvator
Rosa
,
*NL*
but
more
poetic
;
pastels
by
Giraud
and
Muller
,
representing
children
*NL*
like
angels
and
women
with
the
features
of
a
virgin
;
sketches
torn
from
*NL*
the
album
of
Dauzats
'
``
Travels
in
the
East
,
''
that
had
been
made
in
a
few
*NL*
seconds
on
the
saddle
of
a
camel
,
or
beneath
the
dome
of
a
mosque
--
in
a
*NL*
word
,
all
that
modern
art
can
give
in
exchange
and
as
recompense
for
the
*NL*
art
lost
and
gone
with
ages
long
since
past
.
*NL*
*NL*
Albert
expected
to
have
something
new
this
time
to
show
to
the
*NL*
traveller
,
but
,
to
his
great
surprise
,
the
latter
,
without
seeking
*NL*
for
the
signatures
,
many
of
which
,
indeed
,
were
only
initials
,
named
*NL*
instantly
the
author
of
every
picture
in
such
a
manner
that
it
was
easy
*NL*
to
see
that
each
name
was
not
only
known
to
him
,
but
that
each
style
*NL*
associated
with
it
had
been
appreciated
and
studied
by
him
.
From
the
*NL*
salon
they
passed
into
the
bed-chamber
;
it
was
a
model
of
taste
and
*NL*
simple
elegance
.
A
single
portrait
,
signed
by
Leopold
Robert
,
shone
in
*NL*
its
carved
and
gilded
frame
.
This
portrait
attracted
the
Count
of
Monte
*NL*
Cristo
's
attention
,
for
he
made
three
rapid
steps
in
the
chamber
,
and
*NL*
stopped
suddenly
before
it
.
It
was
the
portrait
of
a
young
woman
of
five
*NL*
or
six
and
twenty
,
with
a
dark
complexion
,
and
light
and
lustrous
eyes
,
*NL*
veiled
beneath
long
lashes
.
She
wore
the
picturesque
costume
of
the
*NL*
Catalan
fisherwomen
,
a
red
and
black
bodice
,
and
golden
pins
in
her
*NL*
hair
.
She
was
looking
at
the
sea
,
and
her
form
was
outlined
on
the
blue
*NL*
ocean
and
sky
.
The
light
was
so
faint
in
the
room
that
Albert
did
not
*NL*
perceive
the
pallor
that
spread
itself
over
the
count
's
visage
,
or
the
*NL*
nervous
heaving
of
his
chest
and
shoulders
.
Silence
prevailed
for
an
*NL*
instant
,
during
which
Monte
Cristo
gazed
intently
on
the
picture
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
there
a
most
charming
mistress
,
viscount
,
''
said
the
count
in
*NL*
a
perfectly
calm
tone
;
``
and
this
costume
--
a
ball
costume
,
*NL*
doubtless
--
becomes
her
admirably
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
monsieur
,
''
returned
Albert
,
``
I
would
never
forgive
you
this
mistake
*NL*
if
you
had
seen
another
picture
beside
this
.
You
do
not
know
my
mother
;
*NL*
she
it
is
whom
you
see
here
.
She
had
her
portrait
painted
thus
six
*NL*
or
eight
years
ago
.
This
costume
is
a
fancy
one
,
it
appears
,
and
the
*NL*
resemblance
is
so
great
that
I
think
I
still
see
my
mother
the
same
*NL*
as
she
was
in
1830
.
The
countess
had
this
portrait
painted
during
*NL*
the
count
's
absence
.
She
doubtless
intended
giving
him
an
agreeable
*NL*
surprise
;
but
,
strange
to
say
,
this
portrait
seemed
to
displease
my
*NL*
father
,
and
the
value
of
the
picture
,
which
is
,
as
you
see
,
one
of
the
*NL*
best
works
of
Leopold
Robert
,
could
not
overcome
his
dislike
to
it
.
*NL*
It
is
true
,
between
ourselves
,
that
M.
de
Morcerf
is
one
of
the
most
*NL*
assiduous
peers
at
the
Luxembourg
,
a
general
renowned
for
theory
,
but
a
*NL*
most
mediocre
amateur
of
art
.
It
is
different
with
my
mother
,
who
paints
*NL*
exceedingly
well
,
and
who
,
unwilling
to
part
with
so
valuable
a
picture
,
*NL*
gave
it
to
me
to
put
here
,
where
it
would
be
less
likely
to
displease
*NL*
M.
de
Morcerf
,
whose
portrait
,
by
Gros
,
I
will
also
show
you
.
Excuse
my
*NL*
talking
of
family
matters
,
but
as
I
shall
have
the
honor
of
introducing
*NL*
you
to
the
count
,
I
tell
you
this
to
prevent
you
making
any
allusions
*NL*
to
this
picture
.
The
picture
seems
to
have
a
malign
influence
,
for
my
*NL*
mother
rarely
comes
here
without
looking
at
it
,
and
still
more
rarely
*NL*
does
she
look
at
it
without
weeping
.
This
disagreement
is
the
only
one
*NL*
that
has
ever
taken
place
between
the
count
and
countess
,
who
are
still
*NL*
as
much
united
,
although
married
more
than
twenty
years
,
as
on
the
first
*NL*
day
of
their
wedding
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Monte
Cristo
glanced
rapidly
at
Albert
,
as
if
to
seek
a
hidden
meaning
*NL*
in
his
words
,
but
it
was
evident
the
young
man
uttered
them
in
the
*NL*
simplicity
of
his
heart
.
``
Now
,
''
said
Albert
,
``
that
you
have
seen
all
my
*NL*
treasures
,
allow
me
to
offer
them
to
you
,
unworthy
as
they
are
.
Consider
*NL*
yourself
as
in
your
own
house
,
and
to
put
yourself
still
more
at
your
*NL*
ease
,
pray
accompany
me
to
the
apartments
of
M.
de
Morcerf
,
he
whom
I
*NL*
wrote
from
Rome
an
account
of
the
services
you
rendered
me
,
and
to
whom
*NL*
I
announced
your
promised
visit
,
and
I
may
say
that
both
the
count
and
*NL*
countess
anxiously
desire
to
thank
you
in
person
.
You
are
somewhat
blase
*NL*
I
know
,
and
family
scenes
have
not
much
effect
on
Sinbad
the
Sailor
,
*NL*
who
has
seen
so
many
others
.
However
,
accept
what
I
propose
to
you
as
*NL*
an
initiation
into
Parisian
life
--
a
life
of
politeness
,
visiting
,
*NL*
and
introductions
.
''
Monte
Cristo
bowed
without
making
any
answer
;
he
*NL*
accepted
the
offer
without
enthusiasm
and
without
regret
,
as
one
of
*NL*
those
conventions
of
society
which
every
gentleman
looks
upon
as
a
duty
.
*NL*
Albert
summoned
his
servant
,
and
ordered
him
to
acquaint
M.
and
Madame
*NL*
de
Morcerf
of
the
arrival
of
the
Count
of
Monte
Cristo
.
Albert
followed
*NL*
him
with
the
count
.
When
they
arrived
at
the
ante-chamber
,
above
the
*NL*
door
was
visible
a
shield
,
which
,
by
its
rich
ornaments
and
its
harmony
*NL*
with
the
rest
of
the
furniture
,
indicated
the
importance
the
owner
*NL*
attached
to
this
blazon
.
Monte
Cristo
stopped
and
examined
it
*NL*
attentively
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Azure
seven
merlets
,
or
,
placed
bender
,
''
said
he
.
``
These
are
,
*NL*
doubtless
,
your
family
arms
?
Except
the
knowledge
of
blazons
,
that
*NL*
enables
me
to
decipher
them
,
I
am
very
ignorant
of
heraldry
--
I
,
a
count
*NL*
of
a
fresh
creation
,
fabricated
in
Tuscany
by
the
aid
of
a
commandery
*NL*
of
St.
Stephen
,
and
who
would
not
have
taken
the
trouble
had
I
not
been
*NL*
told
that
when
you
travel
much
it
is
necessary
.
Besides
,
you
must
have
*NL*
something
on
the
panels
of
your
carriage
,
to
escape
being
searched
by
*NL*
the
custom-house
officers
.
Excuse
my
putting
such
a
question
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
not
indiscreet
,
''
returned
Morcerf
,
with
the
simplicity
of
*NL*
conviction
.
``
You
have
guessed
rightly
.
These
are
our
arms
,
that
is
,
*NL*
those
of
my
father
,
but
they
are
,
as
you
see
,
joined
to
another
shield
,
*NL*
which
has
gules
,
a
silver
tower
,
which
are
my
mother
's
.
By
her
side
I
am
*NL*
Spanish
,
but
the
family
of
Morcerf
is
French
,
and
,
I
have
heard
,
one
of
*NL*
the
oldest
of
the
south
of
France
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
replied
Monte
Cristo
``
these
blazons
prove
that
.
Almost
all
the
*NL*
armed
pilgrims
that
went
to
the
Holy
Land
took
for
their
arms
either
a
*NL*
cross
,
in
honor
of
their
mission
,
or
birds
of
passage
,
in
sign
of
*NL*
the
long
voyage
they
were
about
to
undertake
,
and
which
they
hoped
to
*NL*
accomplish
on
the
wings
of
faith
.
One
of
your
ancestors
had
joined
the
*NL*
Crusades
,
and
supposing
it
to
be
only
that
of
St.
Louis
,
that
makes
you
*NL*
mount
to
the
thirteenth
century
,
which
is
tolerably
ancient
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
possible
,
''
said
Morcerf
;
``
my
father
has
in
his
study
a
*NL*
genealogical
tree
which
will
tell
you
all
that
,
and
on
which
I
made
*NL*
commentaries
that
would
have
greatly
edified
Hozier
and
Jaucourt
.
At
*NL*
present
I
no
longer
think
of
it
,
and
yet
I
must
tell
you
that
we
are
*NL*
beginning
to
occupy
ourselves
greatly
with
these
things
under
our
*NL*
popular
government
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
your
government
would
do
well
to
choose
from
the
past
*NL*
something
better
than
the
things
that
I
have
noticed
on
your
monuments
,
*NL*
and
which
have
no
heraldic
meaning
whatever
.
As
for
you
,
viscount
,
''
*NL*
continued
Monte
Cristo
to
Morcerf
,
``
you
are
more
fortunate
than
the
*NL*
government
,
for
your
arms
are
really
beautiful
,
and
speak
to
the
*NL*
imagination
.
Yes
,
you
are
at
once
from
Provence
and
Spain
;
that
*NL*
explains
,
if
the
portrait
you
showed
me
be
like
,
the
dark
hue
I
so
much
*NL*
admired
on
the
visage
of
the
noble
Catalan
.
''
It
would
have
required
the
*NL*
penetration
of
Oedipus
or
the
Sphinx
to
have
divined
the
irony
the
count
*NL*
concealed
beneath
these
words
,
apparently
uttered
with
the
greatest
*NL*
politeness
.
Morcerf
thanked
him
with
a
smile
,
and
pushed
open
the
door
*NL*
above
which
were
his
arms
,
and
which
,
as
we
have
said
,
opened
into
the
*NL*
salon
.
In
the
most
conspicuous
part
of
the
salon
was
another
portrait
.
*NL*
It
was
that
of
a
man
,
from
five
to
eight
and
thirty
,
in
the
uniform
of
*NL*
a
general
officer
,
wearing
the
double
epaulet
of
heavy
bullion
,
that
*NL*
indicates
superior
rank
,
the
ribbon
of
the
Legion
of
Honor
around
his
*NL*
neck
,
which
showed
he
was
a
commander
,
and
on
the
right
breast
,
the
star
*NL*
of
a
grand
officer
of
the
order
of
the
Saviour
,
and
on
the
left
that
*NL*
of
the
grand
cross
of
Charles
III.
,
which
proved
that
the
person
*NL*
represented
by
the
picture
had
served
in
the
wars
of
Greece
and
Spain
,
*NL*
or
,
what
was
just
the
same
thing
as
regarded
decorations
,
had
fulfilled
*NL*
some
diplomatic
mission
in
the
two
countries
.
*NL*
*NL*
Monte
Cristo
was
engaged
in
examining
this
portrait
with
no
less
care
*NL*
than
he
had
bestowed
upon
the
other
,
when
another
door
opened
,
and
he
*NL*
found
himself
opposite
to
the
Count
of
Morcerf
in
person
.
He
was
a
man
*NL*
of
forty
to
forty-five
years
,
but
he
seemed
at
least
fifty
,
and
his
*NL*
black
mustache
and
eyebrows
contrasted
strangely
with
his
almost
white
*NL*
hair
,
which
was
cut
short
,
in
the
military
fashion
.
He
was
dressed
in
*NL*
plain
clothes
,
and
wore
at
his
button-hole
the
ribbons
of
the
different
*NL*
orders
to
which
he
belonged
.
He
entered
with
a
tolerably
dignified
step
,
*NL*
and
some
little
haste
.
Monte
Cristo
saw
him
advance
towards
him
without
*NL*
making
a
single
step
.
It
seemed
as
if
his
feet
were
rooted
to
the
*NL*
ground
,
and
his
eyes
on
the
Count
of
Morcerf
.
``
Father
,
''
said
the
young
*NL*
man
,
``
I
have
the
honor
of
presenting
to
you
the
Count
of
Monte
Cristo
,
*NL*
the
generous
friend
whom
I
had
the
good
fortune
to
meet
in
the
critical
*NL*
situation
of
which
I
have
told
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
most
welcome
,
monsieur
,
''
said
the
Count
of
Morcerf
,
saluting
*NL*
Monte
Cristo
with
a
smile
,
``
and
monsieur
has
rendered
our
house
,
in
*NL*
preserving
its
only
heir
,
a
service
which
insures
him
our
eternal
*NL*
gratitude
.
''
As
he
said
these
words
,
the
count
of
Morcerf
pointed
to
a
*NL*
chair
,
while
he
seated
himself
in
another
opposite
the
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
Monte
Cristo
,
in
taking
the
seat
Morcerf
offered
him
,
placed
himself
in
*NL*
such
a
manner
as
to
remain
concealed
in
the
shadow
of
the
large
velvet
*NL*
curtains
,
and
read
on
the
careworn
and
livid
features
of
the
count
a
*NL*
whole
history
of
secret
griefs
written
in
each
wrinkle
time
had
planted
*NL*
there
.
``
The
countess
,
''
said
Morcerf
,
``
was
at
her
toilet
when
she
was
*NL*
informed
of
the
visit
she
was
about
to
receive
.
She
will
,
however
,
be
in
*NL*
the
salon
in
ten
minutes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
great
honor
to
me
,
''
returned
Monte
Cristo
,
``
to
be
thus
,
on
the
*NL*
first
day
of
my
arrival
in
Paris
,
brought
in
contact
with
a
man
whose
*NL*
merit
equals
his
reputation
,
and
to
whom
fortune
has
for
once
been
*NL*
equitable
,
but
has
she
not
still
on
the
plains
of
Metidja
,
or
in
the
*NL*
mountains
of
Atlas
,
a
marshal
's
staff
to
offer
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
replied
Morcerf
,
reddening
slightly
,
``
I
have
left
the
service
,
*NL*
monsieur
.
Made
a
peer
at
the
Restoration
,
I
served
through
the
first
*NL*
campaign
under
the
orders
of
Marshal
Bourmont
.
I
could
,
therefore
,
*NL*
expect
a
higher
rank
,
and
who
knows
what
might
have
happened
had
the
*NL*
elder
branch
remained
on
the
throne
?
But
the
Revolution
of
July
was
,
it
*NL*
seems
,
sufficiently
glorious
to
allow
itself
to
be
ungrateful
,
and
it
*NL*
was
so
for
all
services
that
did
not
date
from
the
imperial
period
.
I
*NL*
tendered
my
resignation
,
for
when
you
have
gained
your
epaulets
on
the
*NL*
battle-field
,
you
do
not
know
how
to
manoeuvre
on
the
slippery
grounds
*NL*
of
the
salons
.
I
have
hung
up
my
sword
,
and
cast
myself
into
politics
.
*NL*
I
have
devoted
myself
to
industry
;
I
study
the
useful
arts
.
During
the
*NL*
twenty
years
I
served
,
I
often
wished
to
do
so
,
but
I
had
not
the
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
These
are
the
ideas
that
render
your
nation
superior
to
any
other
,
''
*NL*
returned
Monte
Cristo
.
``
A
gentleman
of
high
birth
,
possessor
of
an
*NL*
ample
fortune
,
you
have
consented
to
gain
your
promotion
as
an
obscure
*NL*
soldier
,
step
by
step
--
this
is
uncommon
;
then
become
general
,
peer
of
*NL*
France
,
commander
of
the
Legion
of
Honor
,
you
consent
to
again
commence
*NL*
a
second
apprenticeship
,
without
any
other
hope
or
any
other
desire
than
*NL*
that
of
one
day
becoming
useful
to
your
fellow-creatures
;
this
,
indeed
,
*NL*
is
praiseworthy
,
--
nay
,
more
,
it
is
sublime
.
''
Albert
looked
on
and
*NL*
listened
with
astonishment
;
he
was
not
used
to
see
Monte
Cristo
give
*NL*
vent
to
such
bursts
of
enthusiasm
.
``
Alas
,
''
continued
the
stranger
,
*NL*
doubtless
to
dispel
the
slight
cloud
that
covered
Morcerf
's
brow
,
``
we
*NL*
do
not
act
thus
in
Italy
;
we
grow
according
to
our
race
and
our
species
,
*NL*
and
we
pursue
the
same
lines
,
and
often
the
same
uselessness
,
all
our
*NL*
lives
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
monsieur
,
''
said
the
Count
of
Morcerf
,
``
for
a
man
of
your
merit
,
*NL*
Italy
is
not
a
country
,
and
France
opens
her
arms
to
receive
you
;
*NL*
respond
to
her
call
.
France
will
not
,
perhaps
,
be
always
ungrateful
.
She
*NL*
treats
her
children
ill
,
but
she
always
welcomes
strangers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
father
,
''
said
Albert
with
a
smile
,
``
it
is
evident
you
do
not
know
*NL*
the
Count
of
Monte
Cristo
;
he
despises
all
honors

and
contents
himself
*NL*
with
those
written
on
his
passport
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
the
most
just
remark

replied
the
stranger
,
``
I
ever
heard
made
*NL*
concerning
myself

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
been
free
to
choose
your

''
observed
the
Count
of
*NL*
Morcerf
,
with
a
sigh
;
``
and
you
have
chosen
the
path
strewed
with
*NL*
flowers

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Precisely
,
monsieur
,
''
replied
Monte
Cristo
with
one
of
those
smiles
*NL*
that
a
painter
could
never
represent
or
a
physiologist
analyze
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
did
not
fear
to
fatigue
you
,
''
said
the
general
,
evidently
charmed
*NL*
with
the
count
's
manners
,
``
I
would
have
taken
you
to
the
Chamber
;
*NL*
there
is
a
debate
very
curious
to
those

to
our
modern
*NL*
senators

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
be
most
grateful

monsieur

if
you
will
,
at
some
future
time
,
*NL*
renew
your
offer
,
but
I
have
been
flattered
with
the
hope
of
being
*NL*
introduced
to
the
countess
,
and
I
will
therefore
wait
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
here
is
my
mother
,
''
cried
the
viscount
.
Monte
Cristo
,
turned
round
*NL*
hastily
,
and
saw
Madame
de
Morcerf
at
the
entrance
of
the
salon
,
at
*NL*
the
door
opposite
to
that
by
which
her
husband
had
entered
,
pale
and
*NL*
motionless
;
when
Monte
Cristo
turned
round
,
she
let
fall
her
arm
,
which
*NL*
for
some
unknown
reason
had
been
resting
on
the
gilded
door-post
.
*NL*
She
had
been
there
some
moments
,
and
had
heard
the
last
words
of
the
*NL*
visitor
.
The
latter
rose
and
bowed
to
the
countess
,
who
inclined
herself
*NL*
without
speaking
.
``
Ah
,
good
heavens
,
madame
,
''
said
the
count
,
``
are
you
*NL*
ill
,
or
is
it
the
heat
of
the
room
that
affects
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
ill
,
mother
?
''
cried
the
viscount
,
springing
towards
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
thanked
them
both
with
a
smile
.
``
No
,
''
returned
she
,
``
but
I
feel
*NL*
some
emotion
on
seeing
,
for
the
first
time

the
man
without
whose
*NL*
intervention
we
should
have
been
in
tears
and
desolation
.
Monsieur
,
''
*NL*
continued
the
countess
,
advancing
with
the
majesty
of
a
queen
,
``
I
owe
to
*NL*
you
the
life
of
my
son
,
and
for
this
I
bless
you
.
Now
,
I
thank
you
*NL*
for
the
pleasure
you
give
me
in
thus
affording
me
the
opportunity
of
*NL*
thanking
you
as
I
have
blessed
you
,
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
.
''
*NL*
The
count
bowed
again
,
but
lower
than
before
;
He
was
even
paler
than
*NL*
Mercedes
.
``
Madame
,
''
said
he
,
``
the
count
and
yourself
recompense
too
*NL*
generously
a
simple
action

To
save
a
man
,
to
spare
a
father
's
feelings
,
*NL*
or
a
mother
's
sensibility
,
is
not
to
do
a
good
action
,
but
a
simple
deed
*NL*
of
humanity
.
''
At
these
words
,
uttered
with
the
most
exquisite
sweetness
*NL*
and
politeness
,
Madame
de
Morcerf
replied
.
``
It
is
very
fortunate
for
my
*NL*
son
,
monsieur

that
he
found
such
a
friend

I
thank
God
that
things
*NL*
are
thus

And
Mercedes
raised
her
fine
eyes
to
heaven
with
so
fervent
*NL*
an
expression
of
gratitude
,
that
the
count
fancied
he
saw
tears
in
them
.
*NL*
M.
de
Morcerf
approached
her
.
``
Madame

said
he
.
``
I
have
already
made
my
*NL*
excuses
to
the
count
for
quitting
him

I
pray
you
to
do
so
also
.
The
*NL*
sitting
commences
at
two
;
it
is
now
three
,

I
am
to
speak
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
,
then
,
and
monsieur
and
I
will
strive
our
best
to
forget
your
*NL*
absence

replied
the
countess
,
with
the
same
tone
of
deep
feeling
.
*NL*
``
Monsieur
,
''
continued
she
,
turning
to
Monte
Cristo
,
``
will
you
do
us
the
*NL*
honor
of
passing
the
rest
of
the
day
with
us
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Believe
me
,
madame

I
feel
most
grateful
for
your
kindness

I
*NL*
got
out
of
my
travelling
carriage
at
your
door
this
morning
,
and
I
am
*NL*
ignorant
how
I
am
installed
in
Paris
,
which
I
scarcely
know
;
this
is
but
*NL*
a
trifling
inquietude
,
I
know
,
but
one
that
may
be
appreciated
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
shall
have
the
pleasure
another
time
,
''
said
the
countess
;
``
you
*NL*
promise
that
?
''
Monte
Cristo
inclined
himself
without
answering
,
but
*NL*
the
gesture
might
pass
for
assent
.
``
I
will
not
detain
you
,
monsieur
,
''
*NL*
continued
the
countess
;
``
I
would
not
have
our
gratitude
become
*NL*
indiscreet
or
importunate
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Count
,
''
said
Albert
,
``
I
will
endeavor
to
return
your
politeness
*NL*
at
Rome
,
and
place
my
coupe
at
your
disposal

be
ready

*NL*
*NL*
``
A
thousand
thanks
for
your
kindness

viscount
,
''
returned
the
Count
of
*NL*
Monte
Cristo
``
but
I
suppose
that
M.
Bertuccio
has
suitably
employed
the
*NL*
four
hours
and
a
half
I
have
given
him
,
and
that
I
shall
find
a
carriage
*NL*
of
some
sort
ready
at
the
door

''
Albert
was
used
to
the
count
's
*NL*
manner
of
proceeding
;
he
knew
that
,
like
Nero
,
he
was
in
search
of
the
*NL*
impossible
,
and
nothing
astonished
him
,
but
wishing
to
judge
with
his
*NL*
own
eyes
how
far
the
count
's
orders
had
been
executed
,
he
accompanied
*NL*
him
to
the
door
of
the
house
.
Monte
Cristo
was
not
deceived
.
As
soon
as
*NL*
he
appeared
in
the
Count
of
Morcerf
's
ante-chamber
,
a
footman
,
the
*NL*
same
who
at
Rome
had
brought
the
count
's
card
to
the
two
young
men
,
and
*NL*
announced
his
visit
,
sprang
into
the
vestibule
,
and
when
he
arrived
at
*NL*
the
door
the
illustrious
traveller
found
his
carriage
awaiting
him
.
It
*NL*
was
a
coupe
of
Koller
's
building
,
and
with
horses
and
harness
for
which
*NL*
Drake
had
,
to
the
knowledge
of
all
the
lions
of
Paris
,
refused
on
*NL*
the
previous
day
seven
hundred
guineas
.
``
Monsieur
,
''
said
the
count
to
*NL*
Albert
,
``
I
do
not
ask
you
to
accompany
me
to
my
house

as
I
can
only
*NL*
show
you
a
habitation
fitted
up
in
a
hurry
,
and
I
have
,
as
you
know
,
a
*NL*
reputation
to
keep
up
as
regards
not
being
taken
by
surprise
.
Give
me
,
*NL*
therefore
,
one
more
day
before
I
invite
you
;
I
shall
then
be
certain
not
*NL*
to
fail
in
my
hospitality
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
ask
me
for
a
day
,
count
,
I
know
what
to
anticipate
;
it
will
not
*NL*
be
a
house
I
shall
see
,
but
a
palace
.
You
have
decidedly
some
genius
at
*NL*
your
control
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ma
foi
,
spread
that
idea
,
''
replied
the
Count
of
Monte
Cristo
,
putting
*NL*
his
foot
on
the
velvet-lined
steps
of
his
splendid
carriage
,
``
and
that
*NL*
will
be
worth
something
to
me
among
the
ladies
.
''
As
he
spoke
,
he
sprang
*NL*
into
the
vehicle
,
the
door
was
closed
,
but
not
so
rapidly
that
Monte
*NL*
Cristo
failed
to
perceive
the
almost
imperceptible
movement
which
*NL*
stirred
the
curtains
of
the
apartment
in
which
he
had
left
Madame
de
*NL*
Morcerf
.
When
Albert
returned
to
his
mother
,
he
found
her
in
the
boudoir
*NL*
reclining
in
a
large
velvet
arm-chair
,
the
whole
room
so
obscure
that
*NL*
only
the
shining
spangle
,
fastened
here
and
there
to
the
drapery
,
and
*NL*
the
angles
of
the
gilded
frames
of
the
pictures
,
showed
with
some
*NL*
degree
of
brightness
in
the
gloom
.
Albert
could
not
see
the
face
of
the
*NL*
countess
,
as
it
was
covered
with
a
thin
veil
she
had
put
on
her
head
,
*NL*
and
which
fell
over
her
features
in
misty
folds
,
but
it
seemed
to
him
as
*NL*
though
her
voice
had
altered
.
He
could
distinguish
amid
the
perfumes
of
*NL*
the
roses
and
heliotropes
in
the
flower-stands
,
the
sharp
and
fragrant
*NL*
odor
of
volatile
salts
,
and
he
noticed
in
one
of
the
chased
cups
on
the
*NL*
mantle-piece
the
countess
's
smelling-bottle
,
taken
from
its
shagreen
*NL*
case
,
and
exclaimed
in
a
tone
of
uneasiness
,
as
he
entered
,
--
``
My
dear
*NL*
mother
,
have
you
been
ill
during
my
absence
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
Albert
,
but
you
know
these
roses
,
tuberoses
,
and
orange-flowers
*NL*
throw
out
at
first
,
before
one
is
used
to
them
,
such
violent
perfumes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
my
dear
mother
,
''
said
Albert
,
putting
his
hand
to
the
bell
,
``
they
*NL*
must
be
taken
into
the
ante-chamber
.
You
are
really
ill
,
and
just
now
*NL*
were
so
pale
as
you
came
into
the
room
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
I
pale

Albert
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

a
pallor
that
suits
you
admirably

which
did
not
the
*NL*
less
alarm
my
father
and
myself

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
your
father
speak
of
it

inquired
Mercedes
eagerly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

madame
;
but
do
you
not
remember

he
spoke
of
the
fact

you

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

I
do
remember

replied
the
countess

A
servant
entered
,
summoned
*NL*
by
Albert
's
ring
of
the
bell
.
``
Take
these
flowers
into
the
anteroom
or
*NL*
dressing-room

''
said
the
viscount
;
``
they
make
the
countess
ill
.
''
The
*NL*
footman
obeyed
his
orders
.
A
long
pause
ensued
,
which
lasted
until
all
*NL*
the
flowers
were
removed
.
``
What
is
this
name
of
Monte
Cristo
?
''
inquired
*NL*
the
countess
,
when
the
servant
had
taken
away
the
last
vase
of
flowers
,
*NL*
``
is
it
a
family
name
,
or
the
name
of
the
estate
,
or
a
simple
title
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
,
mother
,
it
is
merely
a
title

The
count
purchased
an
island
*NL*
in
the
Tuscan
archipelago
,
and
,
as
he
told
you
to-day
,
has
founded
*NL*
a
commandery

You
know
the
same
thing
was
done
for
Saint
Stephen
of
*NL*
Florence
,
Saint
George
,
Constantinian
of
Parma
,
and
even
for
the
Order
*NL*
of
Malta
.
Except
this
,
he
has
no
pretension
to
nobility
,
and
calls
*NL*
himself
a
chance
count
,
although
the
general
opinion
at
Rome
is
that
the
*NL*
count
is
a
man
of
very
high
distinction
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
His
manners
are
admirable

said
the
countess
,
``
at

,
as
far
as
I
*NL*
could
judge
in
the
few
minutes
he
remained
here

*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
perfect

so
perfect

aristocracy
of
the
three

nobilities

of
Europe

The
countess

paused
a
moment

then
,
after
a
slight
hesitation
,
she
resumed
,

You

I
ask

you

M.

you

much

your

*NL*

I
must
tell
you
that
I

him
a

Ah

what
he
is

that
is
quite
another

I
have
seen

many

remarkable
things
in
him
,
that
if
you
would
have
me
really
say
what
I
*NL*
think
,
I
shall
reply
that
I
really
do
look
upon
him
as
one
of
Byron
's
*NL*
heroes
,
whom
misery
has
marked
with
a
fatal
brand
;
some
Manfred
,
some
*NL*
Lara
,
some
Werner
,
one
of
those
wrecks
,
as
it
were
,
of
some
ancient
*NL*
family
,
who
,
disinherited
of
their
patrimony
,
have
achieved
one
by
the
*NL*
force
of
their
adventurous
genius
,
which
has
placed
them
above
the
laws
*NL*
of
society
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
say
''

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
that
Monte

an
island
in

Mediterranean

without
inhabitants
or

the
resort
of
smugglers
of
all
nations
,
*NL*
and
pirates
of
every

Who
knows
whether
or
not
these
industrious

worthies
do
not
pay
to
their
feudal
lord
some
dues
for
his
protection

*NL*
*NL*

That

a

have
the
greatest
success
in

salons

Why

this
very
morning

in

he
made
his
entree
amongst

us
by
striking
every

with
amazement

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
do
you

inquired
Mercedes

*NL*
evidently
attaching
great
importance
to
this
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thirty-five

thirty-six

*NL*
*NL*
``
So
young

impossible

said
Mercedes
,
replying
at
the

time

to
what
Albert
said
as
well
as
to
her
own
private
reflection
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
the
truth

Three

certainly

premeditation

a
period
I
was

twelve

and
*NL*
I
,
induced
by
curiosity
,
which
kept
me
alive
to
these
details
,
have
*NL*
compared
the
dates

and
never
found
him
inaccurate
.
The
age
of
this
*NL*
singular
man

who
is
of
no
age

is
then
,
I
am
certain

thirty-five

*NL*
Besides

remark
how
vivid
his
eye

how
raven-black
his
hair
,
*NL*
and
his
brow

though
so
pale

is
free
from
wrinkles

he
is
not

*NL*
vigorous
,
but
also
young

The
countess
bent
her
head
,
as
if
beneath
a
*NL*
heavy
wave
of
bitter
thoughts
.
``
And
has
this
man
displayed
a
friendship

she
asked
with
a
nervous

*NL*
``

me
that

is
a
being
returned
from
the
other
world

''
The
countess
*NL*
shuddered
.
``
Albert

''
she
said
,
in
a
voice
which
was
altered
by
emotion
,
*NL*
``
I

always
put
you

Now
you

able
to
give
me
advice

I
repeat
to
you

Albert

*NL*
be
prudent

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
my

it
is
necessary

make
your
advice
turn
*NL*
to
account

that
I
should
know
beforehand
what
I
have
to
distrust
.
*NL*
The
count
never
plays
,
he
only
drinks
pure
water
tinged
with
a
little
*NL*
sherry
,
and
is
so
rich
that
he
can
not
,
without
intending
to
laugh
at
me

*NL*
try
to
borrow
money

What

then
,
have
I
to
fear
from
him

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
right

said
the

``

my
fears

did
*NL*
your

receive
him

Albert

It
is
necessary
that
we
should
be
more
*NL*
than
complaisant
to
the
count
.
M.
de
Morcerf
is
sometimes
occupied
,
his
*NL*
business
makes
him
reflective
,

he
might

without
intending

*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
could
be
in

my

Albert
;
``
nay

more
,
he
seemed
greatly
flattered

two

the

very
skilfully

agreeably
paid
him
with

as
much

had
known

these
thirty
years

Each
of
these
*NL*
little
tickling
arrows
must
have
pleased
my
father

added
Albert
with
*NL*
a
laugh
.
``
And
thus
they
parted
the
best
possible
friends

M.

Morcerf
even
wished

take

the
Chamber
to
hear
the

*NL*
The
countess
made
no
reply
.
She
fell
into
so
deep
a
revery
that
her
eyes
*NL*
gradually
closed
.
The
young
man
,
standing
up
before
her
,
gazed
upon
*NL*
her
with
that
filial
affection
which
is
so
tender
and
endearing
with
*NL*
children
whose
mothers
are
still
young
and
handsome
.
Then
,
after
seeing
*NL*
her
eyes
closed
,
and
hearing
her
breathe
gently
,
he
believed
she
had
*NL*
dropped
asleep
,
and
left
the
apartment
on
tiptoe
,
closing
the
door
after
*NL*
him
with
the
utmost
precaution
.
``
This
devil
of
a
fellow

he
muttered
,
*NL*
shaking
his
head
;
``
I
said
at
the
time
he
would
create
a
sensation
here

*NL*

I
measure
his
effect
by
an
infallible
thermometer
.
My
mother
has
*NL*
noticed
him
,
and
he
must
therefore
,
perforce
,
be
remarkable

''
He
*NL*
went
down
to
the
stables
,
not
without
some
slight
annoyance
,
when
*NL*
he
remembered
that
the
Count
of
Monte
Cristo
had
laid
his
hands
on
a
*NL*
``
turnout
''
which
sent
his
bays
down
to
second
place
in
the
opinion
of
*NL*
connoisseurs
.
``
Most
decidedly

''
said
he
,
``

*NL*
Meanwhile
the
count
had
arrived
at
his
house
;
it
had
taken
him
six
*NL*
minutes
to
perform
the
distance
,
but
these
six
minutes
were
sufficient
*NL*
to
induce
twenty
young
men
who
knew
the
price
of
the
equipage
they
had
*NL*
been
unable
to
purchase
themselves
,
to
put
their
horses
in
a
gallop
in
*NL*
order
to
see
the
rich
foreigner
who
could
afford
to
give
20,000
francs
*NL*
apiece
for
his
horses
.
The
house
Ali
had
chosen
,
and
which
was
to
serve
*NL*
as
a
town
residence
to
Monte
Cristo
,
was
situated
on
the
right
hand
as
*NL*
you
ascend
the
Champs
Elysees
.
A
thick
clump
of
trees
and
shrubs
rose
in
*NL*
the
centre
,
and
masked
a
portion
of
the
front
;
around
this
shrubbery
*NL*
two
alleys
,
like
two
arms
,
extended
right
and
left
,
and
formed
a
*NL*
carriage-drive
from
the
iron
gates
to
a
double
portico
,
on
every
step
of
*NL*
which
stood
a
porcelain
vase
,
filled
with
flowers
.
This
house
,
isolated
*NL*
from
the
rest
,
had
,
besides
the
main
entrance
,
another
in
the
Rue
*NL*
Ponthieu
.
Even
before
the
coachman
had
hailed
the
concierge
,
the
massy
*NL*
gates
rolled
on
their
hinges
--
they
had
seen
the
Count
coming
,
and
at
*NL*
Paris
,
as
everywhere
else
,
he
was
served
with
the
rapidity
of
lightning
.
*NL*
The
coachman
entered
and
traversed
the
half-circle
without
slackening
*NL*
his
speed
,
and
the
gates
were
closed
ere
the
wheels
had
ceased
to
sound
*NL*
on
the
gravel
.
The
carriage
stopped
at
the
left
side
of
the
portico
,
two
*NL*
men
presented
themselves
at
the
carriage-window
;
the
one
was
Ali
,
who
,
*NL*
smiling
with
an
expression
of
the
most
sincere
joy
,
seemed
amply
repaid
*NL*
by
a
mere
look
from
Monte
Cristo
.
The
other
bowed
respectfully
,
*NL*
and
offered
his
arm
to
assist
the
count
in
descending
.
``
Thanks
,
M.
*NL*
Bertuccio

said
the
count
,
springing
lightly
up
the
three
steps
of
the
*NL*
portico
;
``

*NL*
*NL*
``

Monte

gave
his
hat
,
cane
,
and
gloves
to
the
same
*NL*
French
footman
who
had
called
his
carriage
at
the
Count
of
Morcerf
's
,
*NL*
and
then
he
passed
into
the
small
salon
,
preceded
by
Bertuccio
,
*NL*
who
showed
him
the
way
.
``
These
are
but
indifferent
marbles
in
this

said
Monte

.
``
I
trust

soon

taken

Bertuccio
bowed
.
As
the
steward
had
said
,
the
notary
awaited
him
*NL*
in
the
small
salon
.
He
was
a
simple-looking
lawyer
's
clerk
,
elevated
to
*NL*
the
extraordinary
dignity
of
a
provincial
scrivener
.
``

asked
the
count
*NL*
carelessly
,
addressing
himself
half
to
Bertuccio
,
half
to
the
notary
.
*NL*
The
steward
made
a
gesture
that
signified
,
``
I
do
not
know

''
The
notary
*NL*
looked
at
the
count
with
astonishment
.
``
What

said
he
,
``
does
not
the

*NL*
*NL*
``
Close
by
here
,
monsieur

''
replied
the
notary
--
``
a
little
beyond
Passy
;
a
*NL*
charming
situation
,
in
the
heart
of
the
Bois
de
Boulogne
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
near
as
that
?
''
said
the
Count
;
``
but
that
is
not
in
the
country

What
*NL*
made
you
choose
a
house
at
the
gates
of
Paris

M.
Bertuccio
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
,
''
cried
the
steward
with
a
strange
expression
.
``
His
excellency
*NL*
did
not
charge
me
to
purchase
this
house

If
his
excellency
will
*NL*
recollect

if
he
will
think
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
true
,
''
observed
Monte
Cristo
;
``
I
recollect
now
.
I
read
the
*NL*
advertisement
in
one
of
the
papers
,
and
was
tempted
by
the
false
title
,
*NL*
'
a
country
house
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
not
yet
too
late
,
''
cried
Bertuccio
,
eagerly
;
``
and
if
your
*NL*
excellency
will
intrust
me
with
the
commission
,
I
will
find
you
a
better
*NL*
at
Enghien
,
at
Fontenay-aux-Roses
,
or
at
Bellevue
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
''
returned
Monte
Cristo
negligently
;
``
since
I
have
this
,
I
will
*NL*
keep
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
are
quite
right
,
''
said
the
notary
,
who
feared
to
lose
his
fee
.
*NL*
``
It
is
a
charming
place
,
well
supplied
with
spring-water
and
fine
trees
;
*NL*
a
comfortable
habitation
,
although
abandoned
for
a
long
time
,
without
*NL*
reckoning
the
furniture
,
which
,
although
old
,
is
yet
valuable
,
now
that
*NL*
old
things
are
so
much
sought
after
.
I
suppose
the
count
has
the
tastes
*NL*
of
the
day
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
be
sure
,
''
returned
Monte
Cristo
;
``
it
is
very
convenient
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
more
--
it
is
magnificent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Peste
,
let
us
not
lose
such
an
opportunity

''
returned
Monte
Cristo
.
*NL*
``
The
deed
,
if
you
please
,
Mr.
Notary
.
''
And
he
signed
it
rapidly
,
after
*NL*
having
first
run
his
eye
over
that
part
of
the
deed
in
which
were
*NL*
specified
the
situation
of
the
house
and
the
names
of
the
proprietors
.
*NL*
``
Bertuccio
,
''
said
he
,
``
give
fifty-five
thousand
francs
to
monsieur

''
The
*NL*
steward
left
the
room
with
a
faltering
step
,
and
returned
with
a
bundle
*NL*
of
bank-notes
,
which
the
notary
counted
like
a
man
who
never
gives
a
*NL*
receipt
for
money
until
after
he
is
sure
it
is
all
there
.
``
And
now
,
''
*NL*
demanded
the
count
,
``
are
all
the
forms
complied
with
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All

*NL*
*NL*
``
Have

*NL*
*NL*
``
They

order
I
have
given
him
to
install
the
count
in
his
new
*NL*
possessions
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
;
''
and
Monte
Cristo
made
a
sign
with
his
hand
to
the
notary
,
*NL*
which
said
,
``
I
have
no
further
need
of
you
;
you
may
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
''
observed
the
honest
notary
,
``
the
count
is
,
I
think
,
mistaken
;
it
*NL*
is
only
fifty
thousand
francs

everything
included

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
your
fee
?

*NL*
*NL*
``

included
in

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
certainly
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
it
is
but
fair
that
you
should
be
paid
for
your
loss
of
*NL*
time
and
trouble
,
''
said
the
count
;
and
he
made
a
gesture
of
polite
*NL*
dismissal
.
The
notary
left
the
room
backwards
,
and
bowing
down
to
the
*NL*
ground
;
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
ever
met
a
similar
client
.
``
See
*NL*
this
gentleman
out
,
''
said
the
count
to
Bertuccio
.
And
the
steward
*NL*
followed
the
notary
out
of
the
room
.
Scarcely
was
the
count
alone
,
when
*NL*
he
drew
from
his
pocket
a
book
closed
with
a
lock
,
and
opened
it
with
a
*NL*
key
which
he
wore
round
his
neck
,
and
which
never
left
him
.
After
having
*NL*
sought
for
a
few
minutes
,
he
stopped
at
a
leaf
which
had
several
*NL*
notes
,
and
compared
them
with
the
deed
of
sale
,
which
lay
on
the
table
.
*NL*
''
`
Auteuil
,
Rue
de
la
Fontaine

No.

;
'
it
is
indeed
the
same

said
he
;
*NL*
``
and
now
,
am
I
to
rely
upon
an
avowal
extorted
by
religious
or
physical
*NL*
terror

However
,
in
an
hour
I
shall
know
all

Bertuccio

''
cried
*NL*
he
,
striking
a
light
hammer
with
a
pliant
handle
on
a
small
gong
.
*NL*
``
Bertuccio
!
''
The
steward
appeared
at
the
door
.
``
Monsieur
Bertuccio
,
''
*NL*
said
the
count
,
``
did
you
never
tell
me
that
you
had
travelled
in
*NL*
France
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
In

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

no

returned
the
steward
,
with
a
sort
of
nervous
*NL*
trembling
,
which
Monte
Cristo
,
a
connoisseur
in
all
emotions
,
rightly
*NL*
attributed
to
great
disquietude
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
unfortunate
,
''
returned
he
,
``
that
you
have
never
visited
the
*NL*
environs
,
for
I
wish
to
see
my
new
property
this
evening
,
and
had
you
*NL*
gone
with
me
,
you
could
have
given
me
some
useful
information
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
Auteuil
!
''
cried
Bertuccio
,
whose
copper
complexion
became
livid
--
``
I
*NL*
go
to
Auteuil
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
is
there
surprising
in
that
?
When
I
live
at
Auteuil

you
*NL*
must
come
there
,
as
you
belong
to
my
service

''
Bertuccio
hung
down
his
*NL*
head
before
the
imperious
look
of
his
master
,
and
remained
motionless
,
*NL*
without
making
any
answer
.
``
Why
,
what
has
happened
to
you
?
--
are
you
*NL*
going
to
make
me
ring
a
second
time
for
the
carriage
?
''
asked
Monte
*NL*
Cristo
,
in
the
same
tone
that
Louis
XIV
.
pronounced
the
famous
,
``
I
*NL*
have
been
almost
obliged
to
wait
.
''
Bertuccio
made
but
one
bound
to
the
*NL*
ante-chamber
,
and
cried
in
a
hoarse
voice
--
``
His
excellency
's
horses
!
''
*NL*
Monte
Cristo
wrote
two
or
three
notes
,
and
,
as
he
sealed
the
last
,
the
*NL*
steward
appeared
.
``
Your
excellency
's
carriage
is
at
the
door
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
take
your
hat
and
gloves
,
''
returned
Monte
Cristo
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Am
I
to
accompany
you

your
excellency

cried
Bertuccio
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
,
you
must
give
the
orders
,
for
I
intend
residing
at
the
*NL*
house

''
It
was
unexampled
for
a
servant
of
the
count
's
to
dare
to
*NL*
dispute
an
order
of
his
,
so
the
steward
,
without
saying
a
word
,
followed
*NL*
his
master
,
who
got
into
the
carriage
,
and
signed
to
him
to
follow
,
*NL*
which
he
did
,
taking
his
place
respectfully
on
the
front
seat
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
43
.
The
House
at
Auteuil
.
*NL*
*NL*
Monte
Cristo
noticed
,
as
they
descended
the
staircase
,
that
Bertuccio
*NL*
signed
himself
in
the
Corsican
manner
;
that
is
,
had
formed
the
sign
of
*NL*
the
cross
in
the
air
with
his
thumb
,
and
as
he
seated
himself
in
the
*NL*
carriage
,
muttered
a
short
prayer
.
Any
one
but
a
man
of
exhaustless
*NL*
thirst
for
knowledge
would
have
had
pity
on
seeing
the
steward
's
*NL*
extraordinary
repugnance
for
the
count
's
projected
drive
without
the
*NL*
walls
;
but
the
Count
was
too
curious
to
let
Bertuccio
off
from
this
*NL*
little
journey
.
In
twenty
minutes
they
were
at
Auteuil
;
the
steward
's
*NL*
emotion
had
continued
to
augment
as
they
entered
the
village
.
Bertuccio
,
*NL*
crouched
in
the
corner
of
the
carriage
,
began
to
examine
with
a
feverish
*NL*
anxiety
every
house
they
passed
.
``
Tell
them
to
stop
at
Rue
de
la
*NL*
Fontaine
,
No.
28
,
''
said
the
count
,
fixing
his
eyes
on
the
steward
,
*NL*
to
whom
he
gave
this
order
.
Bertuccio
's
forehead
was
covered
with
*NL*
perspiration
;
however
,
he
obeyed
,
and
,
leaning
out
of
the
window
,
*NL*
he
cried
to
the
coachman
,
--
``
Rue
de
la
Fontaine
,
No.
28
.
''
No.
28
was
*NL*
situated
at
the
extremity
of
the
village
;
during
the
drive
night
had
set
*NL*
in
,
and
darkness
gave
the
surroundings
the
artificial
appearance
of
a
*NL*
scene
on
the
stage
.
The
carriage
stopped
,
the
footman
sprang
off
the
*NL*
box
,
and
opened
the
door
.
``
Well
,
''
said
the
count
,
``
you
do
not
get
out
,
*NL*
M.
Bertuccio
--
you
are
going
to
stay
in
the
carriage
,
then
?
What
are
*NL*
you
thinking
of
this
evening
?
''
Bertuccio
sprang
out
,
and
offered
his
*NL*
shoulder
to
the
count
,
who
,
this
time
,
leaned
upon
it
as
he
descended
*NL*
the
three
steps
of
the
carriage
.
``
Knock
,
''
said
the
count
,
``
and
announce
*NL*
me
.
''
Bertuccio
knocked
,
the
door
opened
,
and
the
concierge
appeared
.
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
asked
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
your
new
master
,
my
good
fellow
,
''
said
the
footman
.
And
he
held
*NL*
out
to
the
concierge
the
notary
's
order
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
house
is
sold
,
then
?
''
demanded
the
concierge
;
``
and
this
gentleman
*NL*
is
coming
to
live
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
my
friend
,
''
returned
the
count
;
``
and
I
will
endeavor
to
give
you
*NL*
no
cause
to
regret
your
old
master
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
monsieur
,
''
said
the
concierge
,
``
I
shall
not
have
much
cause
to
*NL*
regret
him
,
for
he
came
here
but
seldom
;
it
is
five
years
since
he
was
*NL*
here
last
,
and
he
did
well
to
sell
the
house
,
for
it
did
not
bring
him
*NL*
in
anything
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
was
the
name
of
your
old
master
?
''
said
Monte
Cristo
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Marquis
of
Saint-Meran
.
Ah
,
I
am
sure
he
has
not
sold
the
house
for
*NL*
what
he
gave
for
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Marquis
of
Saint-Meran
!
''
returned
the
count
.
``
The
name
is
not
*NL*
unknown
to
me
;
the
Marquis
of
Saint-Meran
!
''
and
he
appeared
to
meditate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
old
gentleman
,
''
continued
the
concierge
,
``
a
stanch
follower
of
the
*NL*
Bourbons
;
he
had
an
only
daughter
,
who
married
M.
de
Villefort
,
who
had
*NL*
been
the
king
's
attorney
at
Nimes
,
and
afterwards
at
Versailles
.
''
Monte
*NL*
Cristo
glanced
at
Bertuccio
,
who
became
whiter
than
the
wall
against
*NL*
which
he
leaned
to
prevent
himself
from
falling
.
``
And
is
not
this
*NL*
daughter
dead
?
''
demanded
Monte
Cristo
;
``
I
fancy
I
have
heard
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
monsieur
,
one
and
twenty
years
ago
;
and
since
then
we
have
not
*NL*
seen
the
poor
marquis
three
times
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thanks
,
thanks
,
''
said
Monte
Cristo
,
judging
from
the
steward
's
utter
*NL*
prostration
that
he
could
not
stretch
the
cord
further
without
danger
of
*NL*
breaking
it
.
``
Give
me
a
light
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
I
accompany
you
,
monsieur
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
it
is
unnecessary
;
Bertuccio
will
show
me
a
light
.
''
And
Monte
*NL*
Cristo
accompanied
these
words
by
the
gift
of
two
gold
pieces
,
which
*NL*
produced
a
torrent
of
thanks
and
blessings
from
the
concierge
.
``
Ah
,
*NL*
monsieur
,
''
said
he
,
after
having
vainly
searched
on
the
mantle-piece
and
*NL*
the
shelves
,
``
I
have
not
got
any
candles
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
one
of
the
carriage-lamps
,
Bertuccio
,
''
said
the
count
,
``
and
show
*NL*
me
the
apartments

''
The
steward
obeyed
in
silence
,
but
it
was
easy
to
*NL*
see
,
from
the
manner
in
which
the
hand
that
held
the
light
trembled
,
how
*NL*
much
it
cost
him
to
obey
.
They
went
over
a
tolerably
large
ground-floor
;
*NL*
a
second
floor
consisted
of
a
salon
,
a
bathroom
,
and
two
bedrooms
;
near
*NL*
one
of
the
bedrooms
they
came
to
a
winding
staircase
that
led
down
to
*NL*
the
garden
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
here
is
a
private
staircase
,
''
said
the
count
;
``
that
is
convenient

*NL*
Light
me

M.
Bertuccio

go
first

we
will
see
where
it
leads
to

*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur

replied
Bertuccio
,
``
it
leads
to
the
garden

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
,
pray
,
how
do
you
know
that

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
ought
to
do
so
,
at

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
let
us
be
sure
of
that

''
Bertuccio
sighed
,
and
went
on
first
;
the
*NL*
stairs
did
,
indeed
,
lead
to
the
garden
.
At
the
outer
door
the
steward
*NL*
paused
.
``
Go
on
,
Monsieur
Bertuccio
,
''
said
the
count
.
But
he
who
was
*NL*
addressed
stood
there
,
stupefied
,
bewildered
,
stunned
;
his
haggard
eyes
*NL*
glanced
around
,
as
if
in

Bertuccio
raised
the

The
door

disclosed
a

the

moon
strove
vainly
to
struggle
through
a

covered
her

illumined

in

Hundred
Days
,
M.
Bertuccio
,
''
said
the
*NL*
count
;
``
unless
I
am
mistaken
,
it
has
been
already
written
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excuse
me
,
excellency
,
but
these
details
are
necessary

and
you
*NL*
promised

be

*NL*
*NL*
``
Go

I
will

*NL*
*NL*
``
One
day
we
received
a
letter
.
I
should
tell
you
that
we
lived
in
the
*NL*
little
village
of
Rogliano
,
at
the
extremity
of
Cape
Corso
.
This
letter
*NL*
was
from
my
brother
.
He
told
us
that
the
army
was
disbanded
,
and
that
he
*NL*
should
return
by
Chateauroux
,
Clermont-Ferrand
,
Le
Puy
,
and
Nimes
;
and
,
*NL*
if
I
had
any
money
,
he
prayed
me
to
leave
it
for
him
at
Nimes
,
with
an
*NL*
inn-keeper
with
whom
I
had
dealings
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
smuggling
line
?
''
said
Monte
Cristo
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
,
your
excellency
?
Every
one
must
live
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
;
go
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
loved
my
brother
tenderly
,
as
I
told
your
excellency
,
and
I
resolved
*NL*
not
to
send
the
money
,
but
to
take
it
to
him
myself
.
I
possessed
a
*NL*
thousand
francs
.
I
left
five
hundred
with
Assunta
,
my
sister-in-law
,
and
*NL*
with
the
other
five
hundred
I
set
off
for
Nimes
.
It
was
easy
to
do
so
,
*NL*
and
as
I
had
my
boat
and
a
lading
to
take
in
at
sea
,
everything
favored
*NL*
my
project
.
But
,
after
we
had
taken
in
our
cargo
,
the
wind
became
*NL*
contrary
,
so
that
we
were
four
or
five
days
without
being
able
to
enter
*NL*
the
Rhone
.
At
last
,
however
,
we
succeeded
,
and
worked
up
to
Arles
.
I
*NL*
left
the
boat
between
Bellegarde
and
Beaucaire
,
and
took
the
road
to
*NL*
Nimes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
getting
to
the
story
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
your
excellency
;
excuse
me
,
but
,
as
you
will
see
,
I
only
tell
you
*NL*
what
is
absolutely
necessary
.
Just
at
this
time
the
famous
massacres
*NL*
took
place
in
the
south
of
France
.
Three
brigands
,
called
Trestaillon
,
*NL*
Truphemy
,
and
Graffan
,
publicly
assassinated
everybody
whom
they
*NL*
suspected
of
Bonapartism
.
You
have
doubtless
heard
of
these
massacres
,
*NL*
your
excellency
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Vaguely
;
I
was
far
from
France
at
that
period
.
Go
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
I
entered
Nimes
,
I
literally
waded
in
blood
;
at
every
step
you
*NL*
encountered
dead
bodies
and
bands
of
murderers
,
who
killed
,
plundered
,
*NL*
and
burned
.
At
the
sight
of
this
slaughter
and
devastation
I
became
*NL*
terrified
,
not
for
myself
--
for
I
,
a
simple
Corsican
fisherman
,
had
*NL*
nothing
to
fear
;
on
the
contrary
,
that
time
was
most
favorable
for
us
*NL*
smugglers
--
but
for
my
brother
,
a
soldier
of
the
empire
,
returning
from
*NL*
the
army
of
the
Loire
,
with
his
uniform
and
his
epaulets
,
there
was
*NL*
everything
to
apprehend
.
I
hastened
to
the
inn-keeper
.
My
misgivings
had
*NL*
been
but
too
true
.
My
brother
had
arrived
the
previous
evening
at
*NL*
Nimes
,
and
,
at
the
very
door
of
the
house
where
he
was
about
to
demand
*NL*
hospitality
,
he
had
been
assassinated
.
I
did
all
in
my
power
to
discover
*NL*
the
murderers
,
but
no
one
durst
tell
me
their
names
,
so
much
were
they
*NL*
dreaded
.
I
then
thought
of
that
French
justice
of
which
I
had
heard
so
*NL*
much
,
and
which
feared
nothing
,
and
I
went
to
the
king
's
attorney
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
this
king
's
attorney
was
named
Villefort
?
''
asked
Monte
Cristo
*NL*
carelessly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
your
excellency
;
he
came
from
Marseilles
,
where
he
had
been
*NL*
deputy-procureur
.
His
zeal
had
procured
him
advancement
,
and
he
was
said
*NL*
to
be
one
of
the
first
who
had
informed
the
government
of
the
departure
*NL*
from
the
Island
of
Elba
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
''
said
Monte
Cristo
``
you
went
to
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Monsieur
,
'
I
said
,
`
my
brother
was
assassinated
yesterday
in
the
*NL*
streets
of
Nimes
,
I
know
not
by
whom
,
but
it
is
your
duty
to
find
out
.
*NL*
You
are
the
representative
of
justice
here
,
and
it
is
for
justice
to
*NL*
avenge
those
she
has
been
unable
to
protect
.
'
--
`
Who
was
your
brother
?
'
*NL*
asked
he
.
--
'
A
lieutenant
in
the
Corsican
battalion
.
'
--
'
A
soldier
of
the
*NL*
usurper
,
then
?
'
--
'
A
soldier
of
the
French
army
.
'
--
`
Well
,
'
replied
he
,
*NL*
`
he
has
smitten
with
the
sword
,
and
he
has
perished
by
the
sword
.
'
--
`
You
*NL*
are
mistaken
,
monsieur
,
'
I
replied
;
`
he
has
perished
by
the
*NL*
poniard
.
'
--
`
What
do
you
want
me
to
do
?
'
asked
the
magistrate
.
--
'
I
have
*NL*
already
told
you
--
avenge
him
.
'
--
`
On
whom
?
'
--
`
On
his
murderers
.
'
--
`
How
*NL*
should
I
know
who
they
are
?
'
--
`
Order
them
to
be
sought
for
.
'
--
`
Why
,
your
*NL*
brother
has
been
involved
in
a
quarrel
,
and
killed
in
a
duel
.
All
these
*NL*
old
soldiers
commit
excesses
which
were
tolerated
in
the
time
of
the
*NL*
emperor
,
but
which
are
not
suffered
now
,
for
the
people
here
do
not
like
*NL*
soldiers
of
such
disorderly
conduct
.
'
--
`
Monsieur
,
'
I
replied
,
`
it
is
not
*NL*
for
myself
that
I
entreat
your
interference
--
I
should
grieve
for
him
or
*NL*
avenge
him
,
but
my
poor
brother
had
a
wife
,
and
were
anything
to
happen
*NL*
to
me
,
the
poor
creature
would
perish
from
want
,
for
my
brother
's
pay
*NL*
alone
kept
her
.
Pray
,
try
and
obtain
a
small
government
pension
for
*NL*
her
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Every
revolution
has
its
catastrophes
,
'
returned
M.
de
Villefort
;
*NL*
`
your
brother
has
been
the
victim
of
this
.
It
is
a
misfortune
,
and
*NL*
government
owes
nothing
to
his
family
.
If
we
are
to
judge
by
all
the
*NL*
vengeance
that
the
followers
of
the
usurper
exercised
on
the
partisans
*NL*
of
the
king
,
when
,
in
their
turn
,
they
were
in
power
,
your
brother
would
*NL*
be
to-day
,
in
all
probability
,
condemned
to
death
.
What
has
happened
is
*NL*
quite
natural
,
and
in
conformity
with
the
law
of
reprisals
.
'
--
`
What
,
'
*NL*
cried
I
,
`
do
you
,
a
magistrate
,
speak
thus
to
me
?
'
--
`
All
these
Corsicans
*NL*
are
mad
,
on
my
honor
,
'
replied
M.
de
Villefort
;
`
they
fancy
that
their
*NL*
countryman
is
still
emperor
.
You
have
mistaken
the
time
,
you
should
have
*NL*
told
me
this
two
months
ago
,
it
is
too
late
now
.
Go
now
,
at
once
,
or
I
*NL*
shall
have
you
put
out
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
looked
at
him
an
instant
to
see
if
there
was
anything
to
hope
from
*NL*
further
entreaty
.
But
he
was
a
man
of
stone
.
I
approached
him
,
and
said
*NL*
in
a
low
voice
,
`
Well
,
since
you
know
the
Corsicans
so
well
,
you
know
*NL*
that
they
always
keep
their
word
.
You
think
that
it
was
a
good
deed
*NL*
to
kill
my
brother
,
who
was
a
Bonapartist
,
because
you
are
a
royalist
.
*NL*
Well
,
I
,
who
am
a
Bonapartist
also
,
declare
one
thing
to
you
,
which
is
,
*NL*
that
I
will
kill
you
.
From
this
moment
I
declare
the
vendetta
against
*NL*
you
,
so
protect
yourself
as
well
as
you
can
,
for
the
next
time
we
meet
*NL*
your
last
hour
has
come
.
'
And
before
he
had
recovered
from
his
surprise
,
*NL*
I
opened
the
door
and
left
the
room
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
well
,
''
said
Monte
Cristo
,
``
such
an
innocent
looking
person
as
you
*NL*
are
to
do
those
things
,
M.
Bertuccio
,
and
to
a
king
's
attorney
at
that
!
*NL*
But
did
he
know
what
was
meant
by
the
terrible
word
`
vendetta
'
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
knew
so
well
,
that
from
that
moment
he
shut
himself
in
his
house
,
*NL*
and
never
went
out
unattended
,
seeking
me
high
and
low
.
Fortunately
,
I
*NL*
was
so
well
concealed
that
he
could
not
find
me
.
Then
he
became
alarmed
,
*NL*
and
dared
not
stay
any
longer
at
Nimes
,
so
he
solicited
a
change
of
*NL*
residence
,
and
,
as
he
was
in
reality
very
influential
,
he
was
nominated
*NL*
to
Versailles
.
But
,
as
you
know
,
a
Corsican
who
has
sworn
to
avenge
*NL*
himself
cares
not
for
distance
,
so
his
carriage
,
fast
as
it
went
,
was
*NL*
never
above
half
a
day
's
journey
before
me
,
who
followed
him
on
foot
.
*NL*
The
most
important
thing
was
,
not
to
kill
him
only
--
for
I
had
an
*NL*
opportunity
of
doing
so
a
hundred
times
--
but
to
kill
him
without
being
*NL*
discovered
--
at
least
,
without
being
arrested
.
I
no
longer
belonged
to
*NL*
myself
,
for
I
had
my
sister-in-law
to
protect
and
provide
for
.
For
three
*NL*
months
I
watched
M.
de
Villefort
,
for
three
months
he
took
not
a
step
*NL*
out-of-doors
without
my
following
him
.
At
length
I
discovered
that
he
*NL*
went
mysteriously
to
Auteuil
.
I
followed
him
thither
,
and
I
saw
him
*NL*
enter
the
house
where
we
now
are
,
only
,
instead
of
entering
by
the
*NL*
great
door
that
looks
into
the
street
,
he
came
on
horseback
,
or
in
his
*NL*
carriage
,
left
the
one
or
the
other
at
the
little
inn
,
and
entered
by
*NL*
the
gate
you
see
there
.
''
Monte
Cristo
made
a
sign
with
his
head
to
*NL*
show
that
he
could
discern
in
the
darkness
the
door
to
which
Bertuccio
*NL*
alluded
.
``
As
I
had
nothing
more
to
do
at
Versailles
,
I
went
to
Auteuil
,
*NL*
and
gained
all
the
information
I
could
.
If
I
wished
to
surprise
him
,
*NL*
it
was
evident
this
was
the
spot
to
lie
in
wait
for
him
.
The
house
*NL*
belonged
,
as
the
concierge
informed
your
excellency
,
to
M.
de
*NL*
Saint-Meran
,
Villefort
's
father-in-law
.
M.
de
Saint-Meran
lived
at
*NL*
Marseilles
,
so
that
this
country
house
was
useless
to
him
,
and
it
was
*NL*
reported
to
be
let
to
a
young
widow
,
known
only
by
the
name
of
`
the
*NL*
baroness
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
evening
,
as
I
was
looking
over
the
wall
,
I
saw
a
young
and
handsome
*NL*
woman
who
was
walking
alone
in
that
garden
,
which
was
not
overlooked
by
*NL*
any
windows
,
and
I
guessed
that
she
was
awaiting
M.
de
Villefort
.
When
*NL*
she
was
sufficiently
near
for
me
to
distinguish
her
features
,
I
saw
she
*NL*
was
from
eighteen
to
nineteen
,
tall
and
very
fair
.
As
she
had
a
loose
*NL*
muslin
dress
on
and
as
nothing
concealed
her
figure
,
I
saw
she
would
ere
*NL*
long
become
a
mother
.
A
few
moments
after
,
the
little
door
was
opened
*NL*
and
a
man
entered
.
The
young
woman
hastened
to
meet
him
.
They
threw
*NL*
themselves
into
each
other
's
arms
,
embraced
tenderly
,
and
returned
*NL*
together
to
the
house
.
The
man
was
M.
de
Villefort
;
I
fully
believed
*NL*
that
when
he
went
out
in
the
night
he
would
be
forced
to
traverse
the
*NL*
whole
of
the
garden
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
,
''
asked
the
count
,
``
did
you
ever
know
the
name
of
this
woman
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
excellency
,
''
returned
Bertuccio
;
``
you
will
see
that
I
had
no
time
*NL*
to
learn
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
evening
,
''
continued
Bertuccio
,
``
I
could
have
killed
the
procureur
,
*NL*
but
as
I
was
not
sufficiently
acquainted
with
the
neighborhood
,
I
was
*NL*
fearful
of
not
killing
him
on
the
spot
,
and
that
if
his
cries
were
*NL*
overheard
I
might
be
taken
;
so
I
put
it
off
until
the
next
occasion
,
and
*NL*
in
order
that
nothing
should
escape
me
,
I
took
a
chamber
looking
into
*NL*
the
street
bordered
by
the
wall
of
the
garden
.
Three
days
after
,
about
*NL*
seven
o'clock
in
the
evening
,
I
saw
a
servant
on
horseback
leave
the
*NL*
house
at
full
gallop
,
and
take
the
road
to
Sevres
.
I
concluded
that
he
*NL*
was
going
to
Versailles
,
and
I
was
not
deceived
.
Three
hours
later
,
*NL*
the
man
returned
covered
with
dust
,
his
errand
was
performed
,
and
two
*NL*
minutes
after
,
another
man
on
foot
,
muffled
in
a
mantle
,
opened
the
*NL*
little
door
of
the
garden
,
which
he
closed
after
him
.
I
descended
*NL*
rapidly
;
although
I
had
not
seen
Villefort
's
face
,
I
recognized
him
by
*NL*
the
beating
of
my
heart
.
I
crossed
the
street
,
and
stopped
at
a
post
*NL*
placed
at
the
angle
of
the
wall
,
and
by
means
of
which
I
had
once
before
*NL*
looked
into
the
garden
.
This
time
I
did
not
content
myself
with
looking
,
*NL*
but
I
took
my
knife
out
of
my
pocket
,
felt
that
the
point
was
sharp
,
and
*NL*
sprang
over
the
wall
.
My
first
care
was
to
run
to
the
door
;
he
had
left
*NL*
the
key
in
it
,
taking
the
simple
precaution
of
turning
it
twice
in
the
*NL*
lock
.
Nothing
,
then
,
preventing
my
escape
by
this
means
,
I
examined
*NL*
the
grounds
.
The
garden
was
long
and
narrow
;
a
stretch
of
smooth
turf
*NL*
extended
down
the
middle
,
and
at
the
corners
were
clumps
of
trees
with
*NL*
thick
and
massy
foliage
,
that
made
a
background
for
the
shrubs
and
*NL*
flowers
.
In
order
to
go
from
the
door
to
the
house
,
or
from
the
house
*NL*
to
the
door
,
M.
de
Villefort
would
be
obliged
to
pass
by
one
of
these
*NL*
clumps
of
trees
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
the
end
of
September
;
the
wind
blew
violently
.
The
faint
*NL*
glimpses
of
the
pale
moon
,
hidden
momentarily
by
masses
of
dark
clouds
*NL*
that
were
sweeping
across
the
sky
,
whitened
the
gravel
walks
that
led
*NL*
to
the
house
,
but
were
unable
to
pierce
the
obscurity
of
the
thick
*NL*
shrubberies
,
in
which
a
man
could
conceal
himself
without
any
fear
of
*NL*
discovery
.
I
hid
myself
in
the
one
nearest
to
the
path
Villefort
must
*NL*
take
,
and
scarcely
was
I
there
when
,
amidst
the
gusts
of
wind
,
I
*NL*
fancied
I
heard
groans
;
but
you
know
,
or
rather
you
do
not
know
,
your
*NL*
excellency
,
that
he
who
is
about
to
commit
an
assassination
fancies
that
*NL*
he
hears
low
cries
perpetually
ringing
in
his
ears
.
Two
hours
passed
*NL*
thus
,
during
which
I
imagined
I
heard
moans
repeatedly
.
Midnight
struck
.
*NL*
As
the
last
stroke
died
away
,
I
saw
a
faint
light
shine
through
the
*NL*
windows
of
the
private
staircase
by
which
we
have
just
descended
.
The
*NL*
door
opened
,
and
the
man
in
the
mantle
reappeared
.
The
terrible
moment
*NL*
had
come
,
but
I
had
so
long
been
prepared
for
it
that
my
heart
did
not
*NL*
fail
in
the
least
.
I
drew
my
knife
from
my
pocket
again
,
opened
it
,
and
*NL*
made
ready
to
strike
.
The
man
in
the
mantle
advanced
towards
me
,
but
as
*NL*
he
drew
near
I
saw
that
he
had
a
weapon
in
his
hand
.
I
was
afraid
,
not
*NL*
of
a
struggle
,
but
of
a
failure
.
When
he
was
only
a
few
paces
from
me
,
*NL*
I
saw
that
what
I
had
taken
for
a
weapon
was
only
a
spade
.
I
was
still
*NL*
unable
to
divine
for
what
reason
M.
de
Villefort
had
this
spade
in
his
*NL*
hands
,
when
he
stopped
close
to
the
thicket
where
I
was
,
glanced
round
,
*NL*
and
began
to
dig
a
hole
in
the
earth
.
I
then
perceived
that
he
was
*NL*
hiding
something
under
his
mantle
,
which
he
laid
on
the
grass
in
order
*NL*
to
dig
more
freely
.
Then
,
I
confess
,
curiosity
mingled
with
hatred
;
*NL*
I
wished
to
see
what
Villefort
was
going
to
do
there
,
and
I
remained
*NL*
motionless
,
holding
my
breath
.
Then
an
idea
crossed
my
mind
,
which
was
*NL*
confirmed
when
I
saw
the
procureur
lift
from
under
his
mantle
a
box
,
two
*NL*
feet
long
,
and
six
or
eight
inches
deep
.
I
let
him
place
the
box
in
the
*NL*
hole
he
had
made
,
then
,
while
he
stamped
with
his
feet
to
remove
all
*NL*
traces
of
his
occupation
,
I
rushed
on
him
and
plunged
my
knife
into
*NL*
his
breast
,
exclaiming
,
--
'
I
am
Giovanni
Bertuccio
;
thy
death
for
my
*NL*
brother
's
;
thy
treasure
for
his
widow
;
thou
seest
that
my
vengeance
is
*NL*
more
complete
than
I
had
hoped
.
'
I
know
not
if
he
heard
these
words
;
I
*NL*
think
he
did
not
,
for
he
fell
without
a
cry
.
I
felt
his
blood
gush
*NL*
over
my
face
,
but
I
was
intoxicated
,
I
was
delirious
,
and
the
blood
*NL*
refreshed
,
instead
of
burning
me
.
In
a
second
I
had
disinterred
the
box
;
*NL*
then
,
that
it
might
not
be
known
I
had
done
so
,
I
filled
up
the
hole
,
*NL*
threw
the
spade
over
the
wall
,
and
rushed
through
the
door
,
which
I
*NL*
double-locked
,
carrying
off
the
key
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
said
Monte
Cristo
``
it
seems
to
me
this
was
nothing
but
murder
and
*NL*
robbery
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
your
excellency
,
''
returned
Bertuccio
;
``
it
was
a
vendetta
followed
*NL*
by
restitution
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
was
the
sum
a
large
one
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
not
money
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
I
recollect
,
''
replied
the
count
;
``
did
you
not
say
something
of
an
*NL*
infant
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
excellency
;
I
hastened
to
the
river
,
sat
down
on
the
bank
,
and
*NL*
with
my
knife
forced
open
the
lock
of
the
box
.
In
a
fine
linen
cloth
*NL*
was
wrapped
a
new-born
child
.
Its
purple
visage
,
and
its
violet-colored
*NL*
hands
showed
that
it
had
perished
from
suffocation
,
but
as
it
was
not
*NL*
yet
cold
,
I
hesitated
to
throw
it
into
the
water
that
ran
at
my
feet
.
*NL*
After
a
moment
I
fancied
that
I
felt
a
slight
pulsation
of
the
heart
,
*NL*
and
as
I
had
been
assistant
at
the
hospital
at
Bastia
,
I
did
what
a
*NL*
doctor
would
have
done
--
I
inflated
the
lungs
by
blowing
air
into
them
,
*NL*
and
at
the
expiration
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
it
began
to
breathe
,
and
*NL*
cried
feebly
.
In
my
turn
I
uttered
a
cry
,
but
a
cry
of
joy
.
`
God
has
*NL*
not
cursed
me
then
,
'
I
cried
,
`
since
he
permits
me
to
save
the
life
of
a
*NL*
human
creature
,
in
exchange
for
the
life
I
have
taken
away
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
did
you
do
with
the
child
?
''
asked
Monte
Cristo
.
``
It
was
an
*NL*
embarrassing
load
for
a
man
seeking
to
escape
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
not
for
a
moment
the
idea
of
keeping
it
,
but
I
knew
that
at
Paris
*NL*
there
was
an
asylum
where
they
receive
such
creatures
.
As
I
passed
the
*NL*
city
gates
I
declared
that
I
had
found
the
child
on
the
road
,
and
I
*NL*
inquired
where
the
asylum
was
;
the
box
confirmed
my
statement
,
the
linen
*NL*
proved
that
the
infant
belonged
to
wealthy
parents
,
the
blood
with
which
*NL*
I
was
covered
might
have
proceeded
from
the
child
as
well
as
from
any
*NL*
one
else
.
No
objection
was
raised
,
but
they
pointed
out
the
asylum
,
*NL*
which
was
situated
at
the
upper
end
of
the
Rue
d'Enfer
,
and
after
having
*NL*
taken
the
precaution
of
cutting
the
linen
in
two
pieces
,
so
that
one
*NL*
of
the
two
letters
which
marked
it
was
on
the
piece
wrapped
around
the
*NL*
child
,
while
the
other
remained
in
my
possession
,
I
rang
the
bell
,
and
*NL*
fled
with
all
speed
.
A
fortnight
after
I
was
at
Rogliano
,
and
I
said
to
*NL*
Assunta
,
--
`
Console
thyself
,
sister
;
Israel
is
dead
,
but
he
is
avenged
.
'
*NL*
She
demanded
what
I
meant
,
and
when
I
had
told
her
all
,
--
`
Giovanni
,
'
*NL*
said
she
,
`
you
should
have
brought
this
child
with
you
;
we
would
have
*NL*
replaced
the
parents
it
has
lost
,
have
called
it
Benedetto
,
and
then
,
in
*NL*
consequence
of
this
good
action
,
God
would
have
blessed
us
.
'
In
reply
I
*NL*
gave
her
the
half
of
the
linen
I
had
kept
in
order
to
reclaim
him
if
we
*NL*
became
rich
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
letters
were
marked
on
the
linen
?
''
said
Monte
Cristo
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
H

an
N

surmounted
by
a
baron
's
coronet

*NL*
``
By

M.
Bertuccio

know
two
things

was

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The

was
the
crime

asked

Abbe
Busoni
came
to

''
*NL*
*NL*
``

take

much
inclined
for

either
.
''
Bertuccio
bowed
,
and
resumed
his
*NL*
story
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Partly
to
drown
the
recollections
of
the
past
that
haunted
me
,
partly
*NL*
to
supply
the
wants
of
the
poor
widow
,
I
eagerly
returned
to
my
trade
of
*NL*
smuggler
,
which
had
become
more
easy
since
that
relaxation
of
the
*NL*
laws
which
always
follows
a
revolution
.
The
southern
districts
were
*NL*
ill-watched
in
particular
,
in
consequence
of
the
disturbances
that
were
*NL*
perpetually
breaking
out
in
Avignon
,
Nimes
,
or
Uzes
.
We
profited
by
this
*NL*
respite
on
the
part
of
the
government
to
make
friends
everywhere
.
Since
*NL*
my
brother
's
assassination
in
the
streets
of
Nimes
,
I
had
never
*NL*
entered
the
town
;
the
result
was
that
the
inn-keeper
with
whom
we
were
*NL*
connected
,
seeing
that
we
would
no
longer
come
to
him
,
was
forced
to
*NL*
come
to
us
,
and
had
established
a
branch
to
his
inn
,
on
the
road
from
*NL*
Bellegarde
to
Beaucaire
,
at
the
sign
of
the
Pont
du
Gard
.
We
had
thus
,
*NL*
at
Aigues-Mortes
,
Martigues
,
or
Bouc
,
a
dozen
places
where
we
left
our
*NL*
goods
,
and
where
,
in
case
of
necessity
,
we
concealed
ourselves
from
the
*NL*
gendarmes
and
custom-house
officers
.
Smuggling
is
a
profitable
trade
,
*NL*
when
a
certain
degree
of
vigor
and
intelligence
is
employed
;
as
for
*NL*
myself
,
brought
up
in
the
mountains
,
I
had
a
double
motive
for
fearing
*NL*
the
gendarmes
and
custom-house
officers
,
as
my
appearance
before
the
*NL*
judges
would
cause
an
inquiry
,
and
an
inquiry
always
looks
back
into
the
*NL*
past
.
And
in
my
past
life
they
might
find
something
far
more
grave
than
*NL*
the
selling
of
smuggled
cigars
,
or
barrels
of
brandy
without
a
permit
.
*NL*
So
,
preferring
death
to
capture
,
I
accomplished
the
most
astonishing
*NL*
deeds
,
and
which
,
more
than
once
,
showed
me
that
the
too
great
care
we
*NL*
take
of
our
bodies
is
the
only
obstacle
to
the
success
of
those
projects
*NL*
which
require
rapid
decision
,
and
vigorous
and
determined
execution
.
In
*NL*
reality
,
when
you
have
once
devoted
your
life
to
your
enterprises
,
*NL*
you
are
no
longer
the
equal
of
other
men
,
or
,
rather
,
other
men
are
no
*NL*
longer
your
equals
,
and
whosoever
has
taken
this
resolution
,
feels
his
*NL*
strength
and
resources
doubled
.

the

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
journeys
became
more
and
more
extensive
and
more
productive
.
Assunta
*NL*
took
care
of
all
,
and
our
little
fortune
increased
.
One
day
as
I
was
*NL*
setting
off
on
an
expedition
,
`
Go
,
'
said
she
;
`
at
your
return
I
will
*NL*
give
you
a
surprise

'
I
questioned
her
,
but
in
vain
;
she
would
tell
me
*NL*
nothing
,
and
I
departed
.
Our
expedition
lasted
nearly
six
weeks
;
we
had
*NL*
been
to
Lucca
to
take
in
oil
,
to
Leghorn
for
English
cottons
,
and
we
*NL*
ran
our
cargo
without
opposition
,
and
returned
home
full
of
joy
.
When
I
*NL*
entered
the
house
,
the
first
thing
I
beheld
in
the
middle
of
Assunta
's
*NL*
chamber
was
a
cradle
that
might
be
called
sumptuous
compared
with
the
*NL*
rest
of
the
furniture
,
and
in
it
a
baby
seven
or
eight
months
old
.
I
*NL*
uttered
a
cry
of
joy
;
the
only
moments
of
sadness
I
had
known
since
the
*NL*
assassination
of
the
procureur
were
caused
by
the
recollection
that
I
*NL*
had
abandoned
this
child
.
For
the
assassination
itself
I
had
never
*NL*
felt
any
remorse
.
Poor
Assunta
had
guessed
all
.
She
had
profited
by
my
*NL*
absence
,
and
furnished
with
the
half
of
the
linen
,
and
having
written
*NL*
down
the
day
and
hour
at
which
I
had
deposited
the
child
at
the
asylum
,
*NL*
had
set
off
for
Paris
,
and
had
reclaimed
it
.
No
objection
was
raised
,
*NL*
and
the
infant
was
given
up
to
her
.
Ah
,
I
confess
,
your
excellency
,
when
*NL*
I
saw
this
poor
creature
sleeping
peacefully
in
its
cradle
,
I
felt
my
*NL*
eyes
filled
with
tears
.
`
Ah
,
Assunta

cried
I
,
`
you
are
an
excellent
*NL*
woman
,
and
heaven
will
bless
you

*NL*
``
This

instrument
of
our
punishment
.
Never
did
a
perverse
nature
*NL*
declare
itself
more
prematurely
,
and
yet
it
was
not
owing
to
any
fault
*NL*
in
his
bringing
up
.
He
was
a
most
lovely
child
,
with
large
blue
eyes
,
of
*NL*
that
deep
color
that
harmonizes
so
well
with
the
blond
complexion
;
only
*NL*
his
hair
,
which
was
too
light
,
gave
his
face
a
most
singular
expression
,
*NL*
and
added
to
the
vivacity
of
his
look
,
and
the
malice
of
his
smile
.
*NL*
Unfortunately
,
there
is
a
proverb
which
says
that
`
red
is
either
*NL*
altogether
good
or
altogether
bad
.
'
The
proverb
was
but
too
correct
*NL*
as
regarded
Benedetto
,
and
even
in
his
infancy
he
manifested
the
*NL*
worst
disposition
.
It
is
true
that
the
indulgence
of
his
foster-mother
*NL*
encouraged
him
.
This
child
,
for
whom
my
poor
sister
would
go
to
the
*NL*
town
,
five
or
six
leagues
off
,
to
purchase
the
earliest
fruits
and
*NL*
the
most
tempting
sweetmeats
,
preferred
to
Palma
grapes
or
Genoese
*NL*
preserves
,
the
chestnuts
stolen
from
a
neighbor
's
orchard
,
or
the
dried
*NL*
apples
in
his
loft
,
when
he
could
eat
as
well
of
the
nuts
and
apples
*NL*
that
grew
in
my
garden
.
One
day
,
when
Benedetto
was
about
five
or
six
,
*NL*
our
neighbor
Vasilio
,
who
,
according
to
the
custom
of
the
country
,
never
*NL*
locked
up
his
purse
or
his
valuables
--
for
,
as
your
excellency
knows
,
*NL*
there
are
no
thieves
in
Corsica
--
complained
that
he
had
lost
a
louis
*NL*
out
of
his
purse
;
we
thought
he
must
have
made
a
mistake
in
counting
*NL*
his
money
,
but
he
persisted
in
the
accuracy
of
his
statement
.
One
day
,
*NL*
Benedetto
,
who
had
been
gone
from
the
house
since
morning
,
to
our
great
*NL*
anxiety
,
did
not
return
until
late
in
the
evening
,
dragging
a
monkey
*NL*
after
him
,
which
he
said
he
had
found
chained
to
the
foot
of
a
tree
.
For
*NL*
more
than
a
month
past
,
the
mischievous
child
,
who
knew
not
what
to
wish
*NL*
for
,
had
taken
it
into
his
head
to
have
a
monkey
.
A
boatman
,
who
had
*NL*
passed
by
Rogliano
,
and
who
had
several
of
these
animals
,
whose
tricks
*NL*
had
greatly
diverted
him
,
had
,
doubtless
,
suggested
this
idea
to
him
.
*NL*
`
Monkeys
are
not
found
in
our
woods
chained
to
trees
,
'
said
I
;
`
confess
*NL*
how
you
obtained
this
animal
.
'
Benedetto
maintained
the
truth
of
what
*NL*
he
had
said
,
and
accompanied
it
with
details
that
did
more
honor
to
his
*NL*
imagination
than
to
his
veracity
.
I
became
angry
;
he
began
to
laugh
,
I
*NL*
threatened
to
strike
him
,
and
he
made
two
steps
backwards
.
`
You
can
not
*NL*
beat
me
,
'
said
he
;
`
you
have
no
right
,
for
you
are
not
my
father
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
never
knew
who
had
revealed
this
fatal
secret
,
which
we
had
so
*NL*
carefully
concealed
from
him
;
however
,
it
was
this
answer
,
in
which
the
*NL*
child
's
whole
character
revealed
itself
,
that
almost
terrified
me
,
and
*NL*
my
arm
fell
without
touching
him
.
The
boy
triumphed
,
and
this
victory
*NL*
rendered
him
so
audacious
,
that
all
the
money
of
Assunta
,
whose
*NL*
affection
for
him
seemed
to
increase
as
he
became
more
unworthy
of
it
,
*NL*
was
spent
in
caprices
she
knew
not
how
to
contend
against
,
and
follies
*NL*
she
had
not
the
courage
to
prevent
.
When
I
was
at
Rogliano
everything
*NL*
went
on
properly
,
but
no
sooner
was
my
back
turned
than
Benedetto
became
*NL*
master
,
and
everything
went
ill
.
When
he
was
only
eleven
,
he
chose
his
*NL*
companions
from
among
the
young
men
of
eighteen
or
twenty
,
the
worst
*NL*
characters
in
Bastia
,
or
,
indeed
,
in
Corsica
,
and
they
had
already
,
*NL*
for
some
mischievous
pranks
,
been
several
times
threatened
with
a
*NL*
prosecution
.
I
became
alarmed
,
as
any
prosecution
might
be
attended
with
*NL*
serious
consequences
.
I
was
compelled
,
at
this
period
,
to
leave
Corsica
*NL*
on
an
important
expedition
;
I
reflected
for
a
long
time
,
and
with
the
*NL*
hope
of
averting
some
impending
misfortune
,
I
resolved
that
Benedetto
*NL*
should
accompany
me
.
I
hoped
that
the
active
and
laborious
life
of
a
*NL*
smuggler
,
with
the
severe
discipline
on
board
,
would
have
a
salutary
*NL*
effect
on
his
character
,
which
was
now
well-nigh
,
if
not
quite
,
corrupt
.
*NL*
I
spoke
to
Benedetto
alone
,
and
proposed
to
him
to
accompany
me
,
*NL*
endeavoring
to
tempt
him
by
all
the
promises
most
likely
to
dazzle
the
*NL*
imagination
of
a
child
of
twelve
.
He
heard
me
patiently
,
and
when
I
had
*NL*
finished
,
burst
out
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Are
you
mad
,
uncle
?
'
-LRB-
he
called
me
by
this
name
when
he
was
in
good
*NL*
humor
-RRB-
;
`
do
you
think
I
am
going
to
change
the
life
I
lead
for
your
mode
*NL*
of
existence
--
my
agreeable
indolence
for
the
hard
and
precarious
toil
*NL*
you
impose
on
yourself
,
exposed
to
the
bitter
frost
at
night
,
and
the
*NL*
scorching
heat
by
day
,
compelled
to
conceal
yourself
,
and
when
you
are
*NL*
perceived
,
receive
a
volley
of
bullets
,
all
to
earn
a
paltry
sum
?
Why
,
I
*NL*
have
as
much
money
as
I
want
;
mother
Assunta
always
furnishes
me
when
I
*NL*
ask
for
it
!
You
see
that
I
should
be
a
fool
to
accept
your
offer
.
'
The
*NL*
arguments
,
and
his
audacity
,
perfectly
stupefied
me
.
Benedetto
rejoined
*NL*
his
associates
,
and
I
saw
him
from
a
distance
point
me
out
to
them
as
a
*NL*
fool
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sweet
child
,
''
murmured
Monte
Cristo
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
had
he
been
my
own
son
,
''
replied
Bertuccio
,
``
or
even
my
nephew
,
I
*NL*
would
have
brought
him
back
to
the
right
road
,
for
the
knowledge
that
*NL*
you
are
doing
your
duty
gives
you
strength
,
but
the
idea
that
I
was
*NL*
striking
a
child
whose
father
I
had
killed
,
made
it
impossible
for
me
*NL*
to
punish
him
.
I
gave
my
sister
,
who
constantly
defended
the
unfortunate
*NL*
boy
,
good
advice
,
and
as
she
confessed
that
she
had
several
times
missed
*NL*
money
to
a
considerable
amount
,
I
showed
her
a
safe
place
in
which
to
*NL*
conceal
our
little
treasure
for
the
future
.
My
mind
was
already
made
*NL*
up
.
Benedetto
could
read
,
write
,
and
cipher
perfectly
,
for
when
the
fit
*NL*
seized
him
,
he
learned
more
in
a
day
than
others
in
a
week
.
My
intention
*NL*
was
to
enter
him
as
a
clerk
in
some
ship
,
and
without
letting
him
know
*NL*
anything
of
my
plan
,
to
convey
him
some
morning
on
board
;
by
this
means
*NL*
his
future
treatment
would
depend
upon
his
own
conduct
.
I
set
off
for
*NL*
France
,
after
having
fixed
upon
the
plan
.
Our
cargo
was
to
be
landed
in
*NL*
the
Gulf
of
Lyons
,
and
this
was
a
difficult
thing
to
do
because
it
was
*NL*
then
the
year
1829
.
The
most
perfect
tranquillity
was
restored
,
and
*NL*
the
vigilance
of
the
custom-house
officers
was
redoubled
,
and
their
*NL*
strictness
was
increased
at
this
time
,
in
consequence
of
the
fair
at
*NL*
Beaucaire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Our
expedition
made
a
favorable
beginning
.
We
anchored
our
*NL*
vessel
--
which
had
a
double
hold
,
where
our
goods
were
concealed
--
amidst
*NL*
a
number
of
other
vessels
that
bordered
the
banks
of
the
Rhone
from
*NL*
Beaucaire
to
Arles
.
On
our
arrival
we
began
to
discharge
our
cargo
in
*NL*
the
night
,
and
to
convey
it
into
the
town
,
by
the
help
of
the
inn-keeper
*NL*
with
whom
we
were
connected
.
Whether
success
rendered
us
imprudent
,
*NL*
or
whether
we
were
betrayed
,
I
know
not
;
but
one
evening
,
about
five
*NL*
o'clock
,
our
little
cabin-boy
came
breathlessly
,
to
inform
us
that
*NL*
he
had
seen
a
detachment
of
custom-house
officers
advancing
in
our
*NL*
direction
.
It
was
not
their
proximity
that
alarmed
us
,
for
detachments
*NL*
were
constantly
patrolling
along
the
banks
of
the
Rhone
,
but
the
care
,
*NL*
according
to
the
boy
's
account
,
that
they
took
to
avoid
being
seen
.
In
*NL*
an
instant
we
were
on
the
alert
,
but
it
was
too
late
;
our
vessel
was
*NL*
surrounded
,
and
amongst
the
custom-house
officers
I
observed
several
*NL*
gendarmes
,
and
,
as
terrified
at
the
sight
of
their
uniforms
as
I
was
*NL*
brave
at
the
sight
of
any
other
,
I
sprang
into
the
hold
,
opened
a
*NL*
port
,
and
dropped
into
the
river
,
dived
,
and
only
rose
at
intervals
to
*NL*
breathe
,
until
I
reached
a
ditch
that
had
recently
been
made
from
the
*NL*
Rhone
to
the
canal
that
runs
from
Beaucaire
to
Aigues-Mortes
.
I
was
now
*NL*
safe
,
for
I
could
swim
along
the
ditch
without
being
seen
,
and
I
reached
*NL*
the
canal
in
safety
.
I
had
designedly
taken
this
direction
.
I
have
*NL*
already
told
your
excellency
of
an
inn-keeper
from
Nimes
who
had
set
up
*NL*
a
little
tavern
on
the
road
from
Bellegarde
to
Beaucaire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Monte
Cristo
``
I
perfectly
recollect
him
;
I
think
he
was
your
*NL*
colleague
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Precisely
,
''
answered
Bertuccio
;
``
but
he
had
,
seven
or
eight
years
*NL*
before
this
period
,
sold
his
establishment
to
a
tailor
at
Marseilles
,
*NL*
who
,
having
almost
ruined
himself
in
his
old
trade
,
wished
to
make
his
*NL*
fortune
in
another
.
Of
course
,
we
made
the
same
arrangements
with
the
*NL*
new
landlord
that
we
had
with
the
old
;
and
it
was
of
this
man
that
I
*NL*
intended
to
ask
shelter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
was
his
name
?
''
inquired
the
count
,
who
seemed
to
become
somewhat
*NL*
interested
in
Bertuccio
's
story
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gaspard
Caderousse
;
he
had
married
a
woman
from
the
village
of
*NL*
Carconte
,
and
whom
we
did
not
know
by
any
other
name
than
that
of
her
*NL*
village
.
She
was
suffering
from
malarial
fever
,
and
seemed
dying
by
*NL*
inches
.
As
for
her
husband
,
he
was
a
strapping
fellow
of
forty
,
or
five
*NL*
and
forty
,
who
had
more
than
once
,
in
time
of
danger
,
given
ample
proof
*NL*
of
his
presence
of
mind
and
courage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
say
,
''
interrupted
Monte
Cristo
``
that
this
took
place
towards
*NL*
the
year

--
*NL*
*NL*
``
1829

``
Ah

Monte

``
the
evening
of
the
3d
of
June

1829

Go
on

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
from
Caderousse
that
I
intended
demanding
shelter
,
and
,
as
we
*NL*
never
entered
by
the
door
that
opened
onto
the
road
,
I
resolved
not
*NL*
to
break
through
the
rule
,
so
climbing
over
the
garden-hedge
,
I
crept
*NL*
amongst
the
olive
and
wild
fig
trees
,
and
fearing
that
Caderousse
might
*NL*
have
some
guest
,
I
entered
a
kind
of
shed
in
which
I
had
often
passed
*NL*
the
night
,
and
which
was
only
separated
from
the
inn
by
a
partition
,
in
*NL*
which
holes
had
been
made
in
order
to
enable
us
to
watch
an
opportunity
*NL*
of
announcing
our
presence
.
My
intention
was
,
if
Caderousse
was
alone
,
*NL*
to
acquaint
him
with
my
presence
,
finish
the
meal
the
custom-house
*NL*
officers
had
interrupted
,
and
profit
by
the
threatened
storm
to
return
*NL*
to
the
Rhone
,
and
ascertain
the
state
of
our
vessel
and
its
crew
.
I
*NL*
stepped
into
the
shed
,
and
it
was
fortunate
I
did
so
,
for
at
that
moment
*NL*
Caderousse
entered
with
a
stranger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
waited
patiently
,
not
to
overhear
what
they
said
,
but
because
I
could
*NL*
do
nothing
else
;
besides
,
the
same
thing
had
occurred
often
before
.
The
*NL*
man
who
was
with
Caderousse
was
evidently
a
stranger
to
the
South
of
*NL*
France
;
he
was
one
of
those
merchants
who
come
to
sell
jewellery
at
*NL*
the
Beaucaire
fair
,
and
who
during
the
month
the
fair
lasts
,
and
during
*NL*
which
there
is
so
great
an
influx
of
merchants
and
customers
from
all
*NL*
parts
of
Europe
,
often
have
dealings
to
the
amount
of
100,000
to
150,000
*NL*
francs
.
Caderousse
entered
hastily
.
Then
,
seeing
that
the
room
was
,
*NL*
as
usual
,
empty
,
and
only
guarded
by
the
dog
,
he
called
to
his
wife
,
*NL*
`
Hello
,
Carconte
,
'
said
he
,
`
the
worthy
priest
has
not
deceived
us
;
the
*NL*
diamond
is
real
.
'
An
exclamation
of
joy
was
heard
,
and
the
staircase
*NL*
creaked
beneath
a
feeble
step
.
`
What
do
you
say
?
'
asked
his
wife
,
pale
*NL*
as
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
'
I
say
that
the
diamond
is
real
,
and
that
this
gentleman
,
one
of
the
*NL*
first
jewellers
of
Paris
,
will
give
us
50,000
.
francs
for
it
.
Only
,
in
*NL*
order
to
satisfy
himself
that
it
really
belongs
to
us
,
he
wishes
you
to
*NL*
relate
to
him
,
as
I
have
done
already
,
the
miraculous
manner
in
which
*NL*
the
diamond
came
into
our
possession
.
In
the
meantime
please
to
sit
*NL*
down
,
monsieur
,
and
I
will
fetch
you
some
refreshment
.
'
The
jeweller
*NL*
examined
attentively
the
interior
of
the
inn
and
the
apparent
poverty
*NL*
of
the
persons
who
were
about
to
sell
him
a
diamond
that
seemed
to
have
*NL*
come
from
the
casket
of
a
prince
.
`
Relate
your
story
,
madame
,
'
said
he
,
*NL*
wishing
,
no
doubt
,
to
profit
by
the
absence
of
the
husband
,
so
that
the
*NL*
latter
could
not
influence
the
wife
's
story
,
to
see
if
the
two
recitals
*NL*
tallied
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Oh
,
'
returned
she
,
`
it
was
a
gift
of
heaven
.
My
husband
was
a
great
*NL*
friend
,
in
1814
or
1815
,
of
a
sailor
named
Edmond
Dantes
.
This
poor
*NL*
fellow
,
whom
Caderousse
had
forgotten
,
had
not
forgotten
him
,
and
at
his
*NL*
death
he
bequeathed
this
diamond
to
him
.
'
--
`
But
how
did
he
obtain
*NL*
it
?
'
asked
the
jeweller
;
`
had
he
it
before
he
was
imprisoned
?
'
--
`
No
,
*NL*
monsieur
;
but
it
appears
that
in
prison
he
made
the
acquaintance
of
a
*NL*
rich
Englishman
,
and
as
in
prison
he
fell
sick
,
and
Dantes
took
the
same
*NL*
care
of
him
as
if
he
had
been
his
brother
,
the
Englishman
,
when
he
was
*NL*
set
free
,
gave
this
stone
to
Dantes
,
who
,
less
fortunate
,
died
,
and
,
in
*NL*
his
turn
,
left
it
to
us
,
and
charged
the
excellent
abbe
,
who
was
here
*NL*
this
morning
,
to
deliver
it
.
'
--
`
The
same
story
,
'
muttered
the
jeweller
;
*NL*
`
and
improbable
as
it
seemed
at
first
,
it
may
be
true
.
There
's
only
*NL*
the
price
we
are
not
agreed
about
.
'
--
`
How
not
agreed
about
?
'
said
*NL*
Caderousse
.
'
I
thought
we
agreed
for
the
price
I
asked
.
'
--
`
That
is
,
'
*NL*
replied
the
jeweller
,
'
I
offered
40,000
francs
.
'
--
`
Forty
thousand
,
'
*NL*
cried
La
Carconte
;
`
we
will
not
part
with
it
for
that
sum
.
The
abbe
told
*NL*
us
it
was
worth
50,000
.
without
the
setting
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
What
was
the
abbe
's
name
?
'
asked
the
indefatigable
questioner
.
--
`
The
*NL*
Abbe
Busoni
,
'
said
La
Carconte
.
--
`
He
was
a
foreigner
?
'
--
`
An
Italian
,
*NL*
from
the
neighborhood
of
Mantua
,
I
believe
.
'
--
`
Let
me
see
this
diamond
*NL*
again
,
'
replied
the
jeweller
;
`
the
first
time
you
are
often
mistaken
as
*NL*
to
the
value
of
a
stone
.
'
Caderousse
took
from
his
pocket
a
small
case
*NL*
of
black
shagreen
,
opened
,
and
gave
it
to
the
jeweller
.
At
the
sight
*NL*
of
the
diamond
,
which
was
as
large
as
a
hazel-nut
,
La
Carconte
's
eyes
*NL*
sparkled
with
cupidity
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
did
you
think
of
this
fine
story

said
Monte
*NL*
Cristo
;
``
did
you
credit
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
your
excellency

I
did
not
look
on
Caderousse
as
a
bad
man
,
and
I
*NL*
thought
him
incapable
of
committing
a
crime
,
or
even
a
theft
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
did
more
honor
to

they
spoke

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

your
excellency

I
had
never
heard
of
him
before

and
never

*NL*
once
afterwards

and
that
was
from
the
Abbe
Busoni
himself
,

I

him
in

prison
at
Nimes
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
on

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
jeweller
took
the
ring
,
and
drawing
from
his
pocket
a
pair
of
steel
*NL*
pliers
and
a
small
set
of
copper
scales
,
he
took
the
stone
out
of
its
*NL*
setting
,
and
weighed
it
carefully
.
'
I
will
give
you
45,000

'
said
he
,
*NL*
`
but
not
a
sou
more
;
besides
,
as
that
is
the
exact
value
of
the
stone
,
*NL*
I
brought
just
that
sum
with
me
.
'
--
`
Oh
,
that
's
no
matter
,
'
replied
*NL*
Caderousse
,
'
I
will
go
back
with
you
to
fetch
the
other
5,000
*NL*
francs
.
'
--
`
No
,
'
returned
the
jeweller
,
giving
back
the
diamond
and
the
*NL*
ring
to
Caderousse
--
`
no
,
it
is
worth
no
more
,
and
I
am
sorry
I
offered
*NL*
so
much
,
for
the
stone
has
a
flaw
in
it
,
which
I
had
not
seen
.
However
,
*NL*
I
will
not
go
back
on
my
word
,
and
I
will
give
45,000
.
'
--
`
At
least
,
*NL*
replace
the
diamond
in
the
ring
,
'
said
La
Carconte
sharply
.
--
`
Ah
,
true
,
'
*NL*
replied
the
jeweller
,
and
he
reset
the
stone
.
--
`
No
matter
,
'
observed
*NL*
Caderousse
,
replacing
the
box
in
his
pocket
,
`
some
one
else
will
*NL*
purchase
it
.
'
--
`
Yes
,
'
continued
the
jeweller
;
`
but
some
one
else
will
*NL*
not
be
so
easy
as
I
am
,
or
content
himself
with
the
same
story
.
It
is
*NL*
not
natural
that
a
man
like
you
should
possess
such
a
diamond
.
He
will
*NL*
inform
against
you
.
You
will
have
to
find
the
Abbe
Busoni
;
and
abbes
who
*NL*
give
diamonds
worth
two
thousand
louis
are
rare
.
The
law
would
seize
it
,
*NL*
and
put
you
in
prison
;
if
at
the
end
of
three
or
four
months
you
are
set
*NL*
at
liberty
,
the
ring
will
be
lost
,
or
a
false
stone
,
worth
three
francs
,
*NL*
will
be
given
you
,
instead
of
a
diamond
worth
50,000
or
perhaps
55,000
*NL*
francs
;
from
which
you
must
allow
that
one
runs
considerable
risk
*NL*
in
purchasing
.
'
Caderousse
and
his
wife
looked
eagerly
at
each
*NL*
other
.
--
`
No
,
'
said
Caderousse
,
`
we
are
not
rich
enough
to
lose
5,000
*NL*
francs
.
'
--
`
As
you
please
,
my
dear
sir
,
'
said
the
jeweller
;
'
I
had
,
*NL*
however
,
as
you
see
,
brought
you
the
money
in
bright
coin
.
'
And
he
drew
*NL*
from
his
pocket
a
handful
of
gold
,
and
held
it
sparkling
before
the
*NL*
dazzled
eyes
of
the
innkeeper
,
and
in
the
other
hand
he
held
a
packet
of
*NL*
bank-notes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
was
evidently
a
severe
struggle
in
the
mind
of
Caderousse
;
it
was
*NL*
plain
that
the
small
shagreen
case
,
which
he
turned
over
and
over
in
*NL*
his
hand
,
did
not
seem
to
him
commensurate
in
value
to
the
enormous
*NL*
sum
which
fascinated
his
gaze
.
He
turned
towards
his
wife
.
`
What
do
you
*NL*
think
of
this
?
'
he
asked
in
a
low
voice
.
--
`
Let
him
have
it
--
let
him
have
*NL*
it
,
'
she
said
.
`
If
he
returns
to
Beaucaire
without
the
diamond
,
he
will
*NL*
inform
against
us
,
and
,
as
he
says
,
who
knows
if
we
shall
ever
again
see
*NL*
the
Abbe
Busoni
?
--
in
all
probability
we
shall
never
see
him
.
'
--
`
Well
,
*NL*
then
,
so
I
will
!
'
said
Caderousse
;
`
so
you
may
have
the
diamond
for
*NL*
45,000
francs
.
But
my
wife
wants
a
gold
chain
,
and
I
want
a
pair
of
*NL*
silver
buckles
.
'
The
jeweller
drew
from
his
pocket
a
long
flat
box
,
*NL*
which
contained
several
samples
of
the
articles
demanded
.
`
Here
,
'
he
*NL*
said
,
'
I
am
very
straightforward
in
my
dealings
--
take
your
choice
.
'
The
*NL*
woman
selected
a
gold
chain
worth
about
five
louis
,
and
the
husband
a
*NL*
pair
of
buckles
,
worth
perhaps
fifteen
francs
.
--
'
I
hope
you
will
not
*NL*
complain
now
?
'
said
the
jeweller
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
The
abbe
told
me
it
was
worth
50,000
francs
,
'
muttered
Caderousse
.
*NL*
`
Come
,
come
--
give
it
to
me
!
What
a
strange
fellow
you
are
,
'
said
*NL*
the
jeweller
,
taking
the
diamond
from
his
hand
.
'
I
give
you
45,000
*NL*
francs
--
that
is
,
2,500
livres
of
income
,
--
a
fortune
such
as
I
wish
I
had
*NL*
myself
,
and
you
are
not
satisfied
!
'
--
`
And
the
five
and
forty
thousand
*NL*
francs
,
'
inquired
Caderousse
in
a
hoarse
voice
,
`
where
are
they
?
*NL*
Come
--
let
us
see
them
.
'
--
`
Here
they
are
,
'
replied
the
jeweller
,
and
he
*NL*
counted
out
upon
the
table
15,000
.
francs
in
gold
,
and
30,000
francs
in
*NL*
bank-notes
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Wait
while
I
light
the
lamp
,
'
said
La
Carconte
;
`
it
is
growing
dark
,
*NL*
and
there
may
be
some
mistake
.
'
In
fact
,
night
had
come
on
during
this
*NL*
conversation
,
and
with
night
the
storm
which
had
been
threatening
for
*NL*
the
last
half-hour
.
The
thunder
growled
in
the
distance
;
but
it
was
*NL*
apparently
not
heard
by
the
jeweller
,
Caderousse
,
or
La
Carconte
,
*NL*
absorbed
as
they
were
all
three
with
the
demon
of
gain
.
I
myself
felt
;
a
*NL*
strange
kind
of
fascination
at
the
sight
of
all
this
gold
and
all
these
*NL*
bank-notes
;
it
seemed
to
me
that
I
was
in
a
dream
,
and
,
as
it
always
*NL*
happens
in
a
dream
,
I
felt
myself
riveted
to
the
spot
.
Caderousse
*NL*
counted
and
again
counted
the
gold
and
the
notes
,
then
handed
them
to
*NL*
his
wife
,
who
counted
and
counted
them
again
in
her
turn
.
During
this
*NL*
time
,
the
jeweller
made
the
diamond
play
and
sparkle
in
the
lamplight
,
*NL*
and
the
gem
threw
out
jets
of
light
which
made
him
unmindful
of
those
*NL*
which
--
precursors
of
the
storm
--
began
to
play
in
at
the
windows
.
`
Well
,
'
*NL*
inquired
the
jeweller
,
`
is
the
cash
all
right
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Yes
,
'
said
Caderousse
.
`
Give
me
the
pocket-book
,
La
Carconte
,
and
find
*NL*
a
bag
somewhere
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
La
Carconte
went
to
a
cupboard
,
and
returned
with
an
old
leathern
*NL*
pocket-book
and
a
bag
.
From
the
former
she
took
some
greasy
letters
,
and
*NL*
put
in
their
place
the
bank-notes
,
and
from
the
bag
took
two
or
three
*NL*
crowns
of
six
livres
each
,
which
,
in
all
probability
,
formed
the
entire
*NL*
fortune
of
the
miserable
couple
.
`
There
,
'
said
Caderousse
;
`
and
now
,
*NL*
although
you
have
wronged
us
of
perhaps
10,000
francs
,
will
you
have
*NL*
your
supper
with
us
?
I
invite
you
with
good-will
.
'
--
`
Thank
you
,
'
*NL*
replied
the
jeweller
,
`
it
must
be
getting
late
,
and
I
must
return
to
*NL*
Beaucaire
--
my
wife
will
be
getting
uneasy
.
'
He
drew
out
his
watch
,
and
*NL*
exclaimed
,
`
Morbleu
,
nearly
nine
o'clock
--
why
,
I
shall
not
get
back
to
*NL*
Beaucaire
before
midnight
!
Good-night
,
my
friends
.
If
the
Abbe
Busoni
*NL*
should
by
any
accident
return
,
think
of
me
.
'
--
`
In
another
week
you
will
*NL*
have
left
Beaucaire
.
'
remarked
Caderousse
,
`
for
the
fair
ends
in
a
few
*NL*
days
.
'
--
`
True
,
but
that
makes
no
difference

Paris

M.
Joannes

in
the
Palais
Royal

arcade

.
I
will
make
the
*NL*
journey
on
purpose
to
see
him
,
if
it
is
worth
while
.
'
At
this
moment
*NL*
there
was
a
tremendous
clap
of
thunder
,
accompanied
by
a
flash
of
*NL*
lightning
so
vivid
,
that
it
quite
eclipsed
the
light
of
the
lamp
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
See
here
,
'
exclaimed
Caderousse
.
`
You
can
not
think
of
going
out
in
*NL*
such
weather
as
this
.
'
--
`
Oh
,
I
am
not
afraid
of
thunder
,
'
said
the
*NL*
jeweller
.
--
`
And
then
there
are
robbers
,
'
said
La
Carconte
.
`
The
road
*NL*
is
never
very
safe
during
fair
time

`
Oh
,
as
to
the
robbers
,
'
said
*NL*
Joannes
,
`
here
is
something
for
them
,
'
and
he
drew
from
his
pocket
a
*NL*
pair
of
small
pistols
,
loaded
to
the
muzzle
.
`
Here
,
'
said
he
,
`
are
dogs
*NL*
who
bark
and
bite
at
the

time

for
your

Friend
Caderousse

'
*NL*
*NL*
``
Caderousse
and
his
wife
again
interchanged
a
meaning
look
.
It
seemed
*NL*
as
though
they
were
both
inspired
at
the
same
time
with
some
*NL*
horrible
thought
.
`
Well
,
then
,
a
good
journey
to
you

said
*NL*
Caderousse
.

`
Thanks

replied
the
jeweller
.
He
then
took
his
cane
,
*NL*
which
he
had
placed
against
an
old
cupboard
,
and
went
out
.
At
the
moment
*NL*
when
he
opened
the
door
,
such
a
gust
of
wind
came
in
that
the
lamp
was
*NL*
nearly
extinguished

`
Oh

said
he
,
`
this
is
very
nice

two

leagues
to
go

`
No

once
more

Caderousse
followed
him
slowly
to
the
threshold
.
*NL*
'
I
can
see
neither
heaven

earth

'
said
the
jeweller
,
who
was
outside
*NL*
the
door

Do

hand
?
'
--
`
To
the
*NL*
right
,
'
said
Caderousse
.
`
You
can
not
go
wrong
--
the
road
is
bordered
by
*NL*
trees
on
both
sides
.
'
--
`
Good
--
all
right
,
'
said
a
voice
almost
lost
in
*NL*
the
distance
.
`
Close
the
door
,
'
said
La
Carconte
;
'
I
do
not
like
open
*NL*
doors
when
it
thunders
.
'
--
`
Particularly
when
there
is
money
in
the
*NL*
house
,
eh
?
'
answered
Caderousse
,
double-locking
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
came
into
the
room
,
went
to
the
cupboard
,
took
out
the
bag
and
*NL*
pocket-book
,
and
both
began
,
for
the
third
time
,
to
count
their
gold
and
*NL*
bank-notes
.
I
never
saw
such
an
expression
of
cupidity
as
the
flickering
*NL*
lamp
revealed
in
those
two
countenances
.
The
woman
,
especially
,
*NL*
was
hideous
;
her
usual
feverish
tremulousness
was
intensified
,
her
*NL*
countenance
had
become
livid
,
and
her
eyes
resembled
burning
coals
.
*NL*
`
Why
,
'
she
inquired
in
a
hoarse
voice
,
`
did
you
invite
him
to
sleep
here
*NL*
to-night
?
'
--
`
Why
?
'
said
Caderousse
with
a
shudder
;
`
why
,
that
he
might
*NL*
not
have
the
trouble
of
returning
to
Beaucaire
.
'
--
`
Ah
,
'
responded
the
*NL*
woman
,
with
an
expression
impossible
to
describe
;
'
I
thought
it
was
*NL*
for
something
else
.
'
--
`
Woman
,
woman
--
why
do
you
have
such
ideas
?
'
*NL*
cried
Caderousse
;
`
or
,
if
you
have
them
,
why
do
n't
you
keep
them
to
*NL*
yourself
?
'
--
`
Well
,
'
said
La
Carconte
,
after
a
moment
's
pause
,
`
you
are
*NL*
not
a
man
.
'
--
`
What
do
you
mean
?
'
added
Caderousse
.
--
`
If
you
had
been
a
*NL*
man
,
you
would
not
have
let
him
go
from
here
.
'
--
`
Woman
!
'
--
`
Or
else
*NL*
he
should
not
have
reached
Beaucaire
.
'
--
`
Woman
!
'
--
`
The
road
takes
a
*NL*
turn
--
he
is
obliged
to
follow
it
--
while
alongside
of
the
canal
there
is
*NL*
a
shorter
road
.
'
--
`
Woman
!
--
you
offend
the
good
God
.
There
--
listen
!
'
And
*NL*
at
this
moment
there
was
a
tremendous
peal
of
thunder
,
while
the
livid
*NL*
lightning
illumined
the
room
,
and
the
thunder
,
rolling
away
in
the
*NL*
distance
,
seemed
to
withdraw
unwillingly
from
the
cursed
abode
.
`
Mercy
!

*NL*
said
Caderousse
,
crossing
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
the
same
moment
,
and
in
the
midst
of
the
terrifying
silence
which
*NL*
usually
follows
a
clap
of
thunder
,
they
heard
a
knocking
at
the
door
.
*NL*
Caderousse
and
his
wife
started
and
looked
aghast
at
each
other
.
`
Who
's
*NL*
there
?

cried
Caderousse
,
rising
,
and
drawing
up
in
a
heap
the
gold
*NL*
and
notes
scattered
over
the
table
,
and
which
he
covered
with
his
two
*NL*
hands

a

La
Carconte
with
a
horrid
smile

Why
,
the
good
God
sends
him
back
*NL*
again

Caderousse
sank
pale
and
breathless
into
his
chair
.
La
Carconte

*NL*
on
the
contrary
,
rose
,
and
going
with
a
firm
step
towards
the
door

*NL*
opened
it
,
saying
,
as
she
did
so

Come

M.

the

drenched
with
rain

The

hospitality

beneath
your
friendly
roof

Caderousse
stammered
out
something
,
*NL*
while
he
wiped
away
the
sweat
that
started
to
his
brow

``
As
the
jeweller
returned
to
the
apartment
,
he
cast
around
him
a
*NL*
scrutinizing
glance
--
but
there
was
nothing
to
excite
suspicion
,
if
*NL*
it
did
not
exist
,
or
to
confirm
it
,
if
it
were
already
awakened

*NL*
Caderousse
's
hands
still
grasped
the
gold
and
bank-notes
,
and
La
*NL*
Carconte
called
up
her
sweetest
smiles
while
welcoming
the
reappearance
*NL*
of
their
guest
.
`
Well
,
well
,
'
said
the
jeweller
,
`
you
seem
,
my
good
*NL*
friends
,
to
have
had
some
fears
respecting
the
accuracy
of
your
money

*NL*
by
counting
it
over
so
carefully
directly
I
was
gone

'

`
Oh
,
no
,
'
*NL*
answered
Caderousse
,
`
that
was
not
my
reason
,
I
can
assure
you
;
but
the
*NL*
circumstances
by
which
we
have
become
possessed
of
this
wealth
are
so
*NL*
unexpected
,
as
to
make
us
scarcely
credit
our
good
fortune
,
and
it
is
*NL*
only
by
placing
the
actual
proof
of
our
riches
before
our
eyes
that
*NL*
we
can
persuade
ourselves
that
the
whole
affair
is
not
a
dream

'
The
*NL*
jeweller
smiled
.
--
`
Have
you
any
other
guests
in
your
house
?
'
inquired
*NL*
he
.
--
`
Nobody
but
ourselves
,
'
replied
Caderousse
;
`
the
fact
is
,
we
do
not
*NL*
lodge
travellers
--
indeed
,
our
tavern
is
so
near
the
town
,
that
nobody
*NL*
would
think
of
stopping
here
.
'
--
`
Then
I
am
afraid
I
shall
very
much
*NL*
inconvenience
you
.

`
Inconvenience
us
?
Not
at
all

my
dear
sir

La
Carconte
in
her
most
gracious
manner

`
Not
at

assure
*NL*
you

`
But
where
will
you
manage
to
stow
me
?
'

`
In
the
chamber
*NL*
overhead
.
'
--
`
Surely
that
is
where
you
yourselves
sleep
?
'
--
`
Never
mind
*NL*
that
;
we
have
a
second
bed
in

stared
at

his
wife
with
much
astonishment

``
The
jeweller
,
meanwhile
,
was
humming
a
song
as
he
stood
warming
his
*NL*
back
at
the
fire
La
Carconte
had
kindled
to
dry
the
wet
garments
of
her
*NL*
guest
;
and
this
done
,
she
next
occupied
herself
in
arranging
his
supper
,
*NL*
by
spreading
a
napkin
at
the
end
of
the
table
,
and
placing
on
it
the
*NL*
slender
remains
of
their
dinner
,
to
which
she
added
three
or
four
*NL*
fresh-laid
eggs
.
Caderousse
had
once
more
parted
with
his
treasure
--
the
*NL*
banknotes
were
replaced
in
the
pocket-book
,
the
gold
put
back
into
*NL*
the
bag
,
and
the
whole
carefully
locked
in
the
cupboard
.
He
then
began
*NL*
pacing
the
room
with
a
pensive
and
gloomy
air
,
glancing
from
time
to
*NL*
time
at
the
jeweller
,
who
stood
reeking
with
the
steam
from
his
wet
*NL*
clothes
,
and
merely
changing
his
place
on
the
warm
hearth
,
to
enable
the
*NL*
whole
of
his
garments
to
be
dried
.

''
`
There

she
placed
a
bottle
of
wine

table

you
are

Joannes

I

Caderousse

We
dined
so
very
late

hastily
*NL*
interposed
La
Carconte
.
--
`
Then
it
seems
I
am
to
eat
alone
,
'
remarked
*NL*
the
jeweller
.
--
`
Oh
,
we
shall
have
the
pleasure
of
waiting
upon
you

*NL*
answered
La
Carconte
,
with
an
eager
attention
she
was
not
accustomed
to
*NL*
manifest
even
to
guests
who
paid
for
what
they
took

*NL*
``
From
time
to
time
Caderousse
darted
on
his
wife
keen
,
searching
*NL*
glances
,
but
rapid
as
the
lightning
flash
.
The
storm
still
continued
.
*NL*
`
There
,
there
,
'
said
La
Carconte
;
`
do
you
hear
that
?
upon
my
word
,
you
*NL*
did
well
to
come
back
.

`
Nevertheless
,
'
replied
the
jeweller
,
`
if
by
*NL*
the
time
I
have
finished
my
supper
the
tempest
has
at
all
abated
,
I
*NL*
shall
make
another
start
.

`
It
's
the
mistral
,

said
Caderousse
,
`

*NL*
it
will
be
sure
to
last
till
to-morrow
morning

He
sighed
*NL*
heavily
.
--
`
Well
,
'
said
the
jeweller
,
as
he
placed
himself
at
table
,
*NL*
`
all
I
can
say
is
,
so
much
the
worse
for
those
who
are
abroad
.
'
--
`
Yes
,

*NL*
chimed
in
La
Carconte
,
`
they
will
have
a
wretched
night
of
it

``
The
jeweller
began
eating
his
supper
,
and
the
woman
,
who
was
ordinarily
*NL*
so
querulous
and
indifferent
to
all
who
approached
her
,
was
suddenly
*NL*
transformed
into
the
most
smiling
and
attentive
hostess
.
Had
the
unhappy
*NL*
man
on
whom
she
lavished
her
assiduities
been
previously
acquainted
with
*NL*
her
,
so
sudden
an
alteration
might
well
have
excited
suspicion
in
his
*NL*
mind
,
or
at
least
have
greatly
astonished
him
.
Caderousse
,
meanwhile
,
*NL*
continued
to
pace
the
room
in
gloomy
silence
,
sedulously
avoiding
*NL*
the
sight
of
his
guest
;
but
as
soon
as
the
stranger
had
completed
his
*NL*
repast
,
the
agitated
inn-keeper
went
eagerly
to
the
door
and
opened
*NL*
it
.
'
I
believe
the
storm
is
over
,
'
said
he
.
But
as
if
to
contradict
his
*NL*
statement
,
at
that
instant
a
violent
clap
of
thunder
seemed
to
shake
the
*NL*
house
to
its
very
foundation
,
while
a
sudden
gust
of
wind
,
mingled
*NL*
with
rain
,
extinguished
the
lamp
he
held
in
his
hand
.
Trembling
and
*NL*
awe-struck
,
Caderousse
hastily
shut
the
door
and
returned
to
his
*NL*
guest
,
while
La
Carconte
lighted
a
candle
by
the
smouldering
ashes
that
*NL*
glimmered
on
the
hearth
.
`
You
must
be
tired
,
'
said
she
to
the
jeweller
;
*NL*
'
I
have
spread
a
pair
of
white
sheets
on
your
bed
;
go
up
when
you
are
*NL*
ready
,
and
sleep
well
.

*NL*
``
Joannes
stayed
for
a
while
to
see
whether
the
storm
seemed
to
abate
in
*NL*
its
fury
,
but
a
brief
space
of
time
sufficed
to
assure
him
that
,
*NL*
instead
of
diminishing
,
the
violence
of
the
rain
and
thunder
momentarily
*NL*
increased
;
resigning
himself
,
therefore
,
to
what
seemed
inevitable
,
he
*NL*
bade
his
host
good-night
,
and
mounted
the
stairs
.
He
passed
over
my
head
*NL*
and
I
heard
the
flooring
creak
beneath
his
footsteps
.
The
quick
,
eager
*NL*
glance
of
La
Carconte
followed
him
as
he
ascended
,
while
Caderousse
,
on
*NL*
the
contrary
,
turned
his
back
,
and
seemed
most
anxiously
to
avoid
even
*NL*
glancing
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
these
circumstances
did
not
strike
me
as
painfully
at
the
time
as
*NL*
they
have
since
done
;
in
fact
,
all
that
had
happened
-LRB-
with
the
exception
*NL*
of
the
story
of
the
diamond
,
which
certainly
did
wear
an
air
of
*NL*
improbability
-RRB-
,
appeared
natural
enough
,
and
called
for
neither
*NL*
apprehension
nor
mistrust
;
but
,
worn
out
as
I
was
with
fatigue
,
and
*NL*
fully
purposing
to
proceed
onwards
directly
the
tempest
abated
,
I
*NL*
determined
to
obtain
a
few
hours
'
sleep
.
Overhead
I
could
accurately
*NL*
distinguish
every
movement
of
the
jeweller
,
who
,
after
making
the
best
*NL*
arrangements
in
his
power
for
passing
a
comfortable
night
,
threw
himself
*NL*
on
his
bed
,
and
I
could
hear
it
creak
and
groan
beneath
his
weight
.
*NL*
Insensibly
my
eyelids
grew
heavy
,
deep
sleep
stole
over
me
,
and
having
*NL*
no
suspicion
of
anything
wrong
,
I
sought
not
to
shake
it
off
.
I
looked
*NL*
into
the
kitchen
once
more
and
saw
Caderousse
sitting
by
the
side
of
a
*NL*
long
table
upon
one
of
the
low
wooden
stools
which
in
country
places
are
*NL*
frequently
used
instead
of
chairs
;
his
back
was
turned
towards
me
,
so
*NL*
that
I
could
not
see
the
expression
of
his
countenance
--
neither
should
I
*NL*
have
been
able
to
do
so
had
he
been
placed
differently
,
as
his
head
was
*NL*
buried
between
his
two
hands
.
La
Carconte
continued
to
gaze
on
him
for
*NL*
some
time
,
then
shrugging
her
shoulders
,
she
took
her
seat
immediately
*NL*
opposite
to
him
.
At
this
moment
the
expiring
embers
threw
up
a
fresh
*NL*
flame
from
the
kindling
of
a
piece
of
wood
that
lay
near
,
and
a
bright
*NL*
light
flashed
over
the
room
.
La
Carconte
still
kept
her
eyes
fixed
*NL*
on
her
husband
,
but
as
he
made
no
sign
of
changing
his
position
,
she
*NL*
extended
her
hard
,
bony
hand
,
and
touched
him
on
the
forehead
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Caderousse
shuddered
.
The
woman
's
lips
seemed
to
move
,
as
though
she
*NL*
were
talking
;
but
because
she
merely
spoke
in
an
undertone
,
or
my
senses
*NL*
were
dulled
by
sleep
,
I
did
not
catch
a
word
she
uttered
.
Confused
*NL*
sights
and
sounds
seemed
to
float
before
me
,
and
gradually
I
fell
into
*NL*
a
deep
,
heavy
slumber
.
How
long
I
had
been
in
this
unconscious
state
*NL*
I
know
not
,
when
I
was
suddenly
aroused
by
the
report
of
a
pistol
,
*NL*
followed
by
a
fearful
cry
.
Weak
and
tottering
footsteps
resounded
across
*NL*
the
chamber
above
me
,
and
the
next
instant
a
dull
,
heavy
weight
seemed
*NL*
to
fall
powerless
on
the
staircase
.
I
had
not
yet
fully
recovered
*NL*
consciousness
,
when
again
I
heard
groans
,
mingled
with
half-stifled
*NL*
cries
,
as
if
from
persons
engaged
in
a
deadly
struggle
.
A
cry
more
*NL*
prolonged
than
the
others
and
ending
in
a
series
of
groans
effectually
*NL*
roused
me
from
my
drowsy
lethargy
.
Hastily
raising
myself
on
one
arm
,
I
*NL*
looked
around
,
but
all
was
dark
;
and
it
seemed
to
me
as
if
the
rain
must
*NL*
have
penetrated
through
the
flooring
of
the
room
above
,
for
some
kind
*NL*
of
moisture
appeared
to
fall
,
drop
by
drop
,
upon
my
forehead
,
and
when
I
*NL*
passed
my
hand
across
my
brow
,
I
felt
that
it
was
wet
and
clammy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
the
fearful
noises
that
had
awakened
me
had
succeeded
the
most
*NL*
perfect
silence
--
unbroken
,
save
by
the
footsteps
of
a
man
walking
about
*NL*
in
the
chamber
above
.
The
staircase
creaked
,
he
descended
into
the
room
*NL*
below
,
approached
the
fire
and
lit
a
candle
.
The
man
was
Caderousse
--
he
*NL*
was
pale
and
his
shirt
was
all
bloody
.
Having
obtained
the
light
,
he
*NL*
hurried
up-stairs
again
,
and
once
more
I
heard
his
rapid
and
uneasy
*NL*
footsteps
.
A
moment
later
he
came
down
again
,
holding
in
his
hand
the
*NL*
small
shagreen
case
,
which
he
opened
,
to
assure
himself
it
contained
*NL*
the
diamond
,
--
seemed
to
hesitate
as
to
which
pocket
he
should
put
it
*NL*
in
,
then
,
as
if
dissatisfied
with
the
security
of
either
pocket
,
he
*NL*
deposited
it
in
his
red
handkerchief
,
which
he
carefully
rolled
round
*NL*
his
head
.
After
this
he
took
from
his
cupboard
the
bank-notes
and
gold
*NL*
he
had
put
there
,
thrust
the
one
into
the
pocket
of
his
trousers
,
and
*NL*
the
other
into
that
of
his
waistcoat
,
hastily
tied
up
a
small
bundle
of
*NL*
linen
,
and
rushing
towards
the
door
,
disappeared
in
the
darkness
of
the
*NL*
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
all
became
clear
and
manifest
to
me
,
and
I
reproached
myself
*NL*
with
what
had
happened
,
as
though
I
myself
had
done
the
guilty
deed
.
*NL*
I
fancied
that
I
still
heard
faint
moans
,
and
imagining
that
the
*NL*
unfortunate
jeweller
might
not
be
quite
dead
,
I
determined
to
go
to
his
*NL*
relief
,
by
way
of
atoning
in
some
slight
degree
,
not
for
the
crime
I
had
*NL*
committed
,
but
for
that
which
I
had
not
endeavored
to
prevent
.
For
this
*NL*
purpose
I
applied
all
the
strength
I
possessed
to
force
an
entrance
*NL*
from
the
cramped
spot
in
which
I
lay
to
the
adjoining
room
.
The
poorly
*NL*
fastened
boards
which
alone
divided
me
from
it
yielded
to
my
efforts
,
*NL*
and
I
found
myself
in
the
house
.
Hastily
snatching
up
the
lighted
*NL*
candle
,
I
hurried
to
the
staircase
;
about
midway
a
body
was
lying
quite
*NL*
across
the
stairs
.
It
was
that
of
La
Carconte
.
The
pistol
I
had
heard
*NL*
had
doubtless
been
fired
at
her
.
The
shot
had
frightfully
lacerated
her
*NL*
throat
,
leaving
two
gaping
wounds
from
which
,
as
well
as
the
mouth
,
the
*NL*
blood
was
pouring
in
floods
.
She
was
stone
dead
.
I
strode
past
her
,
and
*NL*
ascended
to
the
sleeping
chamber
,
which
presented
an
appearance
of
the
*NL*
wildest
disorder
.
The
furniture
had
been
knocked
over
in
the
deadly
*NL*
struggle
that
had
taken
place
there
,
and
the
sheets
,
to
which
the
*NL*
unfortunate
jeweller
had
doubtless
clung
,
were
dragged
across
the
room
.
*NL*
The
murdered
man
lay
on
the
floor
,
his
head
leaning
against
the
wall
,
*NL*
and
about
him
was
a
pool
of
blood
which
poured
forth
from
three
large
*NL*
wounds
in
his
breast
;
there
was
a
fourth
gash
,
in
which
a
long
table
*NL*
knife
was
plunged
up
to
the
handle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
stumbled
over
some
object
;
I
stooped
to
examine
--
it
was
the
second
*NL*
pistol
,
which
had
not
gone
off
,
probably
from
the
powder
being
wet
.
I
*NL*
approached
the
jeweller
,
who
was
not
quite
dead
,
and
at
the
sound
of
my
*NL*
footsteps
and
the
creaking
of
the
floor
,
he
opened
his
eyes
,
fixed
*NL*
them
on
me
with
an
anxious
and
inquiring
gaze
,
moved
his
lips
as
though
*NL*
trying
to
speak
,
then
,
overcome
by
the
effort
,
fell
back
and
expired
.
*NL*
This
appalling
sight
almost
bereft
me
of
my
senses
,
and
finding
that
I
*NL*
could
no
longer
be
of
service
to
any
one
in
the
house
,
my
only
desire
*NL*
was
to
fly
.
I
rushed
towards
the
staircase
,
clutching
my
hair
,
and
*NL*
uttering
a
groan
of
horror
.
Upon
reaching
the
room
below
,
I
found
five
*NL*
or
six
custom-house
officers
,
and
two
or
three
gendarmes
--
all
heavily
*NL*
armed
.
They
threw
themselves
upon
me
.
I
made
no
resistance
;
I
was
no
*NL*
longer
master
of
my
senses
.
When
I
strove
to
speak
,
a
few
inarticulate
*NL*
sounds
alone
escaped
my
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
I
noticed
the
significant
manner
in
which
the
whole
party
pointed
to
*NL*
my
blood-stained
garments
,
I
involuntarily
surveyed
myself
,
and
then
*NL*
I
discovered
that
the
thick
warm
drops
that
had
so
bedewed
me
as
I
lay
*NL*
beneath
the
staircase
must
have
been
the
blood
of
La
Carconte
.
I
pointed
*NL*
to
the
spot
where
I
had
concealed
myself
.
`
What
does
he
mean
?
'
asked
a
*NL*
gendarme
.
One
of
the
officers
went
to
the
place
I
directed
.
`
He
means
,
'
*NL*
replied
the
man
upon
his
return
,
`
that
he
got
in
that
way
;
'
and
he
*NL*
showed
the
hole
I
had
made
when
I
broke
through
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
saw
that
they
took
me
for
the
assassin
.
I
recovered
force
and
*NL*
energy
enough
to
free
myself
from
the
hands
of
those
who
held
me
,
while
*NL*
I
managed
to
stammer
forth
--
'
I
did
not
do
it
!
Indeed
,
indeed
I
did
not
!
'
*NL*
A
couple
of
gendarmes
held
the
muzzles
of
their
carbines
against
my
*NL*
breast
.
--
`
Stir
but
a
step
,
'
said
they
,
`
and
you
are
a
dead
man
.
'
--
`
Why
*NL*
should
you
threaten
me
with
death
,
'
cried
I
,
`
when
I
have
already
*NL*
declared
my
innocence
?
'
--
`
Tush
,
tush
,
'
cried
the
men
;
`
keep
your
*NL*
innocent
stories
to
tell
to
the
judge
at
Nimes
.
Meanwhile
,
come
along
*NL*
with
us
;
and
the
best
advice
we
can
give
you
is
to
do
so
unresistingly
.
'
*NL*
Alas
,
resistance
was
far
from
my
thoughts
.
I
was
utterly
overpowered
*NL*
by
surprise
and
terror
;
and
without
a
word
I
suffered
myself
to
be
*NL*
handcuffed
and
tied
to
a
horse
's
tail
,
and
thus
they
took
me
to
Nimes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
been
tracked
by
a
customs-officer
,
who
had
lost
sight
of
me
near
*NL*
the
tavern
;
feeling
certain
that
I
intended
to
pass
the
night
there
,
he
*NL*
had
returned
to
summon
his
comrades
,
who
just
arrived
in
time
to
*NL*
hear
the
report
of
the
pistol
,
and
to
take
me
in
the
midst
of
such
*NL*
circumstantial
proofs
of
my
guilt
as
rendered
all
hopes
of
proving
*NL*
my
innocence
utterly
futile
.
One
only
chance
was
left
me
,
that
of
*NL*
beseeching
the
magistrate
before
whom
I
was
taken
to
cause
every
inquiry
*NL*
to
be
made
for
the
Abbe
Busoni
,
who
had
stopped
at
the
inn
of
the
Pont
*NL*
du
Gard
on
that
morning
.
If
Caderousse
had
invented
the
story
relative
*NL*
to
the
diamond
,
and
there
existed
no
such
person
as
the
Abbe
Busoni
,
*NL*
then
,
indeed
,
I
was
lost
past
redemption
,
or
,
at
least
,
my
life
hung
*NL*
upon
the
feeble
chance
of
Caderousse
himself
being
apprehended
*NL*
and
confessing
the
whole
truth
.
Two
months
passed
away
in
hopeless
*NL*
expectation
on
my
part
,
while
I
must
do
the
magistrate
the
justice
*NL*
to
say
that
he
used
every
means
to
obtain
information
of
the
person
I
*NL*
declared
could
exculpate
me
if
he
would
.
Caderousse
still
evaded
all
*NL*
pursuit
,
and
I
had
resigned
myself
to
what
seemed
my
inevitable
fate
.
*NL*
My
trial
was
to
come
on
at
the
approaching
assizes
;
when
,
on
the
8th
of
*NL*
September
--
that
is
to
say
,
precisely
three
months
and
five
days
after
*NL*
the
events
which
had
perilled
my
life
--
the
Abbe
Busoni
,
whom
I
never
*NL*
ventured
to
believe
I
should
see
,
presented
himself
at
the
prison
doors
,
*NL*
saying
he
understood
one
of
the
prisoners
wished
to
speak
to
him
;
*NL*
he
added
,
that
having
learned
at
Marseilles
the
particulars
of
my
*NL*
imprisonment
,
he
hastened
to
comply
with
my
desire
.
You
may
easily
*NL*
imagine
with
what
eagerness
I
welcomed
him
,
and
how
minutely
I
*NL*
related
the
whole
of
what
I
had
seen
and
heard
.
I
felt
some
degree
of
*NL*
nervousness
as
I
entered
upon
the
history
of
the
diamond
,
but
,
to
my
*NL*
inexpressible
astonishment
,
he
confirmed
it
in
every
particular
,
and
to
*NL*
my
equal
surprise
,
he
seemed
to
place
entire
belief
in
all
I
said
.
And
*NL*
then
it
was
that
,
won
by
his
mild
charity
,
seeing
that
he
was
acquainted
*NL*
with
all
the
habits
and
customs
of
my
own
country
,
and
considering
also
*NL*
that
pardon
for
the
only
crime
of
which
I
was
really
guilty
might
come
*NL*
with
a
double
power
from
lips
so
benevolent
and
kind
,
I
besought
him
to
*NL*
receive
my
confession
,
under
the
seal
of
which
I
recounted
the
Auteuil
*NL*
affair
in
all
its
details
,
as
well
as
every
other
transaction
of
my
*NL*
life
.
That
which
I
had
done
by
the
impulse
of
my
best
feelings
produced
*NL*
the
same
effect
as
though
it
had
been
the
result
of
calculation
.
My
*NL*
voluntary
confession
of
the
assassination
at
Auteuil
proved
to
him
that
*NL*
I
had
not
committed
that
of
which
I
stood
accused
.
When
he
quitted
me
,
*NL*
he
bade
me
be
of
good
courage
,
and
to
rely
upon
his
doing
all
in
his
*NL*
power
to
convince
my
judges
of
my
innocence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
speedy
proofs
that
the
excellent
abbe
was
engaged
in
my
behalf
,
*NL*
for
the
rigors
of
my
imprisonment
were
alleviated
by
many
trifling
*NL*
though
acceptable
indulgences
,
and
I
was
told
that
my
trial
was
to
be
*NL*
postponed
to
the
assizes
following
those
now
being
held
.
In
the
interim
*NL*
it
pleased
providence
to
cause
the
apprehension
of
Caderousse
,
who
was
*NL*
discovered
in
some
distant
country
,
and
brought
back
to
France
,
where
he
*NL*
made
a
full
confession
,
refusing
to
make
the
fact
of
his
wife
's
having
*NL*
suggested
and
arranged
the
murder
any
excuse
for
his
own
guilt
.
*NL*
The
wretched
man
was
sentenced
to
the
galleys
for
life
,
and
I
was
*NL*
immediately
set
at
liberty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
then
it
was
,
I
presume
,
''
said
Monte
Cristo
``
that
you
came
to
me
as
*NL*
the
bearer
of
a
letter
from
the
Abbe
Busoni
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was

your
excellency

benevolent

evident
interest

Your
mode
of

ruin
of

inquired
I

A

who
entertains
a

high
regard

applied
to
me
a
short
time
since
to
procure
him
a

confidential

Would
you
like
such
a
post

give
you

But
you
must
swear
solemnly
that
I
shall
never

reason

my
recommendation

I
extended
my
hand
,
and
was
about
to
pledge
myself
*NL*
by
any
promise
he
would
dictate
,
but
he
stopped
me

`
It
is
unnecessary
*NL*
for
you

bind
yourself
by
any
vow

said
he
;

know

*NL*
Corsican
nature

well

continued
he

*NL*
after
rapidly
writing
the
few
lines
I
brought
to
your
excellency

and
*NL*
upon
receipt
of
which
you
deigned
to
receive
me
into

proudly
I
ask

done
so

never

to

*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas
,
I
have
still
to
recount
the
most
distressing
period

my
life

*NL*
Anxious
as
you
may
suppose
I
was
to
behold
and
comfort
my
dear
sister

*NL*
I
lost
no
time
in
hastening
to
Corsica
,
but
when
I
arrived
at
Rogliano
I
*NL*
found
a
house
of
mourning
,
the
consequences
of
a
scene
so
horrible
that
*NL*
the
neighbors
remember

speak
of
it
to
this

Acting
by

tormenting

he
disappeared
and
remained
*NL*
away
all
day
,
leaving
the
kind-hearted
Assunta
,
who
loved
him
as
if
he
*NL*
were
her
own
child
,
to
weep
over
his
conduct
and
bewail
his
absence
.
*NL*
Evening
came
,
and
still
,
with
all
the
patient
solicitude
of
a
mother
,
*NL*
she
watched
for
his
return
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
the
eleventh
hour
struck
,
he
entered
with
a
swaggering
air
,
attended
*NL*
by
two
of
the
most
dissolute
and
reckless
of
his
boon
companions
.
She
*NL*
stretched
out
her
arms
to
him
,
but
they
seized
hold
of
her
,
and
one
of
*NL*
the
three
--
none
other
than
the
accursed
Benedetto
exclaimed
,
--
`
Put
her
*NL*
to
torture
and
she
'll
soon
tell
us
where
her
money
is
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
unfortunately
happened
that
our
neighbor
,
Vasilio
,
was
at
Bastia
,
*NL*
leaving
no
person
in
his
house
but
his
wife
;
no
human
creature
beside
*NL*
could
hear
or
see
anything
that
took
place
within
our
dwelling
.
Two
held
*NL*
poor
Assunta
,
who
,
unable
to
conceive
that
any
harm
was
intended
to
her
,
*NL*
smiled
in
the
face
of
those
who
were
soon
to
become
her
executioners
.
*NL*
The
third
proceeded
to
barricade
the
doors
and
windows
,
then
returned
,
*NL*
and
the
three
united
in
stifling
the
cries
of
terror
incited
by
the
*NL*
sight
of
these
preparations
,
and
then
dragged
Assunta
feet
foremost
*NL*
towards
the
brazier
,
expecting
to
wring
from
her
an
avowal
of
where
her
*NL*
supposed
treasure
was
secreted
.
In
the
struggle
her
clothes
caught
*NL*
fire
,
and
they
were
obliged
to
let
go
their
hold
in
order
to
preserve
*NL*
themselves
from
sharing
the
same
fate
.
Covered
with
flames
,
Assunta
*NL*
rushed
wildly
to
the
door
,
but
it
was
fastened
;
she
flew
to
the
windows
,
*NL*
but
they
were
also
secured
;
then
the
neighbors
heard
frightful
shrieks
;
*NL*
it
was
Assunta
calling
for
help
.
The
cries
died
away
in
groans
,
and
next
*NL*
morning
,
as
soon
as
Vasilio
's
wife
could
muster
up
courage
to
venture
*NL*
abroad
,
she
caused
the
door
of
our
dwelling
to
be
opened
by
the
public
*NL*
authorities
,
when
Assunta
,
although
dreadfully
burnt
,
was
found
still
*NL*
breathing
;
every
drawer
and
closet
in
the
house
had
been
forced
open
,
*NL*
and
the
money
stolen
.
Benedetto
never
again
appeared
at
Rogliano
,
*NL*
neither
have
I
since
that
day
either
seen
or
heard
anything
concerning
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
subsequently
to
these
dreadful
events
that
I
waited
on
*NL*
your
excellency
,
to
whom
it
would
have
been
folly
to
have
mentioned
*NL*
Benedetto
,
since
all
trace
of
him
seemed
entirely
lost
;
or
of
my
sister
,
*NL*
since
she
was
dead
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
in
what
light
did
you
view
the
occurrence
?
''
inquired
Monte
Cristo
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
a
punishment
for
the
crime
I
had
committed
,
''
answered
Bertuccio
.
*NL*
``
Oh
,
those
Villeforts
are
an
accursed
race
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Truly
they
are
,
''
murmured
the
count
in
a
lugubrious
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
,
''
resumed
Bertuccio
,
``
your
excellency
may
,
perhaps
,
be
able
*NL*
to
comprehend
that
this
place
,
which
I
revisit
for
the
first
time
--
this
*NL*
garden
,
the
actual
scene
of
my
crime
--
must
have
given
rise
to
*NL*
reflections
of
no
very
agreeable
nature
,
and
produced
that
gloom
and
*NL*
depression
of
spirits
which
excited
the
notice
of
your
excellency
,
who
*NL*
was
pleased
to
express
a
desire
to
know
the
cause
.
At
this
instant
a
*NL*
shudder
passes
over
me
as
I
reflect
that
possibly
I
am
now
standing
on
*NL*
the
very
grave
in
which
lies
M.
de
Villefort
,
by
whose
hand
the
ground
*NL*
was
dug
to
receive
the
corpse
of
his
child
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Everything
is
possible
,
''
said
Monte
Cristo
,
rising
from
the
bench
on
*NL*
which
he
had
been
sitting
;
``
even
,
''
he
added
in
an
inaudible
voice
,
``
even
*NL*
that
the
procureur
be
not
dead
.
The
Abbe
Busoni
did
right
to
send
you
*NL*
to
me
,
''
he
went
on
in
his
ordinary
tone
,
``
and
you
have
done
well
in
*NL*
relating
to
me
the
whole
of
your
history
,
as
it
will
prevent
my
forming
*NL*
any
erroneous
opinions
concerning
you
in
future
.
As
for
that
Benedetto
,
*NL*
who
so
grossly
belied
his
name
,
have
you
never
made
any
effort
to
trace
*NL*
out
whither
he
has
gone
,
or
what
has
become
of
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
far
from
wishing
to
learn
whither
he
has
betaken
himself
,
I
should
*NL*
shun
the
possibility
of
meeting
him
as
I
would
a
wild
beast
.
Thank
God
,
*NL*
I
have
never
heard
his
name
mentioned
by
any
person
,
and
I
hope
and
*NL*
believe
he
is
dead
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
not
think
so
,
Bertuccio
,
''
replied
the
count
;
``
for
the
wicked
are
*NL*
not
so
easily
disposed
of
,
for
God
seems
to
have
them
under
his
special
*NL*
watch-care
to
make
of
them
instruments
of
his
vengeance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
be
it
,
''
responded
Bertuccio
,
``
all
I
ask
of
heaven
is
that
I
may
*NL*
never
see
him
again
.
And
now
,
your
excellency
,
''
he
added
,
bowing
his
*NL*
head
,
``
you
know
everything
--
you
are
my
judge
on
earth
,
as
the
Almighty
*NL*
is
in
heaven
;
have
you
for
me
no
words
of
consolation
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
good
friend
,
I
can
only
repeat
the
words
addressed
to
you
by
the
*NL*
Abbe
Busoni
.
Villefort
merited
punishment
for
what
he
had
done
to
you
,
*NL*
and
,
perhaps
,
to
others
.
Benedetto
,
if
still
living
,
will
become
the
*NL*
instrument
of
divine
retribution
in
some
way
or
other
,
and
then
be
duly
*NL*
punished
in
his
turn
.
As
far
as
you
yourself
are
concerned
,
I
see
but
*NL*
one
point
in
which
you
are
really
guilty
.
Ask
yourself
,
wherefore
,
after
*NL*
rescuing
the
infant
from
its
living
grave
,
you
did
not
restore
it
to
its
*NL*
mother
?
There
was
the
crime
,
Bertuccio
--
that
was
where
you
became
really
*NL*
culpable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
True
,
excellency
,
that
was
the
crime
,
the
real
crime
,
for
in
that
*NL*
I
acted
like
a
coward
.
My
first
duty
,
directly
I
had
succeeded
in
*NL*
recalling
the
babe
to
life
,
was
to
restore
it
to
its
mother
;
but
,
in
*NL*
order
to
do
so
,
I
must
have
made
close
and
careful
inquiry
,
which
would
,
*NL*
in
all
probability
,
have
led
to
my
own
apprehension
;
and
I
clung
to
*NL*
life
,
partly
on
my
sister
's
account
,
and
partly
from
that
feeling
*NL*
of
pride
inborn
in
our
hearts
of
desiring
to
come
off
untouched
and
*NL*
victorious
in
the
execution
of
our
vengeance
.
Perhaps
,
too
,
the
natural
*NL*
and
instinctive
love
of
life
made
me
wish
to
avoid
endangering
my
*NL*
own
.
And
then
,
again
,
I
am
not
as
brave
and
courageous
as
was
my
poor
*NL*
brother
.
''
Bertuccio
hid
his
face
in
his
hands
as
he
uttered
these
words
,
*NL*
while
Monte
Cristo
fixed
on
him
a
look
of
inscrutable
meaning
.
After
*NL*
a
brief
silence
,
rendered
still
more
solemn
by
the
time
and
place
,
the
*NL*
count
said
,
in
a
tone
of
melancholy
wholly
unlike
his
usual
manner
,
``
In
*NL*
order
to
bring
this
conversation
to
a
fitting
termination
-LRB-
the
last
we
*NL*
shall
ever
hold
upon
this
subject
-RRB-
,
I
will
repeat
to
you
some
words
I
*NL*
have
heard
from
the
lips
of
the
Abbe
Busoni
.
For
all
evils
there
are
*NL*
two
remedies
--
time
and
silence
.
And
now
leave
me
,
Monsieur
Bertuccio
,
to
*NL*
walk
alone
here
in
the
garden
.
The
very
circumstances
which
inflict
*NL*
on
you
,
as
a
principal
in
the
tragic
scene
enacted
here
,
such
painful
*NL*
emotions
,
are
to
me
,
on
the
contrary
,
a
source
of
something
like
*NL*
contentment
,
and
serve
but
to
enhance
the
value
of
this
dwelling
in
my
*NL*
estimation
.
The
chief
beauty
of
trees
consists
in
the
deep
shadow
of
*NL*
their
umbrageous
boughs
,
while
fancy
pictures
a
moving
multitude
of
*NL*
shapes
and
forms
flitting
and
passing
beneath
that
shade
.
Here
I
have
*NL*
a
garden
laid
out
in
such
a
way
as
to
afford
the
fullest
scope
for
the
*NL*
imagination
,
and
furnished
with
thickly
grown
trees
,
beneath
whose
leafy
*NL*
screen
a
visionary
like
myself
may
conjure
up
phantoms
at
will
.
This
to
*NL*
me
,
who
expected
but
to
find
a
blank
enclosure
surrounded
by
a
straight
*NL*
wall
,
is
,
I
assure
you
,
a
most
agreeable
surprise
.
I
have
no
fear
of
*NL*
ghosts
,
and
I
have
never
heard
it
said
that
so
much
harm
had
been
done
*NL*
by
the
dead
during
six
thousand
years
as
is
wrought
by
the
living
in
a
*NL*
single
day
.
Retire
within
,
Bertuccio
,
and
tranquillize
your
mind
.
Should
*NL*
your
confessor
be
less
indulgent
to
you
in
your
dying
moments
than
you
*NL*
found
the
Abbe
Busoni
,
send
for
me
,
if
I
am
still
on
earth
,
and
I
will
*NL*
soothe
your
ears
with
words
that
shall
effectually
calm
and
soothe
your
*NL*
parting
soul
ere
it
goes
forth
to
traverse
the
ocean
called
eternity
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bertuccio
bowed
respectfully
,
and
turned
away
,
sighing
heavily
.
Monte
*NL*
Cristo
,
left
alone
,
took
three
or
four
steps
onwards
,
and
murmured
,
*NL*
``
Here
,
beneath
this
plane-tree
,
must
have
been
where
the
infant
's
grave
*NL*
was
dug
.
There
is
the
little
door
opening
into
the
garden
.
At
this
*NL*
corner
is
the
private
staircase
communicating
with
the
sleeping
*NL*
apartment
.
There
will
be
no
necessity
for
me
to
make
a
note
of
these
*NL*
particulars
,
for
there
,
before
my
eyes
,
beneath
my
feet
,
all
around
me
,
*NL*
I
have
the
plan
sketched
with
all
the
living
reality
of
truth
.
''
After
*NL*
making
the
tour
of
the
garden
a
second
time
,
the
count
re-entered
his
*NL*
carriage
,
while
Bertuccio
,
who
perceived
the
thoughtful
expression
of
*NL*
his
master
's
features
,
took
his
seat
beside
the
driver
without
uttering
*NL*
a
word
.
The
carriage
proceeded
rapidly
towards
Paris
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
same
evening
,
upon
reaching
his
abode
in
the
Champs
Elysees
,
the
*NL*
Count
of
Monte
Cristo
went
over
the
whole
building
with
the
air
of
one
*NL*
long
acquainted
with
each
nook
or
corner
.
Nor
,
although
preceding
the
*NL*
party
,
did
he
once
mistake
one
door
for
another
,
or
commit
the
smallest
*NL*
error
when
choosing
any
particular
corridor
or
staircase
to
conduct
him
*NL*
to
a
place
or
suite
of
rooms
he
desired
to
visit
.
Ali
was
his
principal
*NL*
attendant
during
this
nocturnal
survey
.
Having
given
various
orders
to
*NL*
Bertuccio
relative
to
the
improvements
and
alterations
he
desired
*NL*
to
make
in
the
house
,
the
Count
,
drawing
out
his
watch
,
said
to
the
*NL*
attentive
Nubian
,
``
It
is
half-past
eleven
o'clock
;
Haidee
will
soon
be
*NL*
here
.
Have
the
French
attendants
been
summoned
to
await
her
coming
?
''
Ali
*NL*
extended
his
hands
towards
the
apartments
destined
for
the
fair
Greek
,
*NL*
which
were
so
effectually
concealed
by
means
of
a
tapestried
entrance
,
*NL*
that
it
would
have
puzzled
the
most
curious
to
have
divined
their
*NL*
existence
.
Ali
,
having
pointed
to
the
apartments
,
held
up
three
fingers
*NL*
of
his
right
hand
,
and
then
,
placing
it
beneath
his
head
,
shut
his
eyes
,
*NL*
and
feigned
to
sleep
.
``
I
understand
,
''
said
Monte
Cristo
,
well
acquainted
*NL*
with
Ali
's
pantomime
;
``
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
three
female
*NL*
attendants
await
their
new
mistress
in
her
sleeping-chamber
.
''
Ali
,
with
*NL*
considerable
animation
,
made
a
sign
in
the
affirmative
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madame
will
be
tired
to-night
,
''
continued
Monte
Cristo
,
``
and
will
,
no
*NL*
doubt
,
wish
to
rest
.
Desire
the
French
attendants
not
to
weary
her
with
*NL*
questions
,
but
merely
to
pay
their
respectful
duty
and
retire
.
You
will
*NL*
also
see
that
the
Greek
servants
hold
no
communication
with
those
of
*NL*
this
country
.
''
He
bowed
.
Just
at
that
moment
voices
were
heard
hailing
*NL*
the
concierge
.
The
gate
opened
,
a
carriage
rolled
down
the
avenue
,
and
*NL*
stopped
at
the
steps
.
The
count
hastily
descended
,
presented
himself
*NL*
at
the
already
opened
carriage
door
,
and
held
out
his
hand
to
a
young
*NL*
woman
,
completely
enveloped
in
a
green
silk
mantle
heavily
embroidered
*NL*
with
gold
.
She
raised
the
hand
extended
towards
her
to
her
lips
,
and
*NL*
kissed
it
with
a
mixture
of
love
and
respect
.
Some
few
words
passed
*NL*
between
them
in
that
sonorous
language
in
which
Homer
makes
his
gods
*NL*
converse
.
The
young
woman
spoke
with
an
expression
of
deep
tenderness
,
*NL*
while
the
count
replied
with
an
air
of
gentle
gravity
.
Preceded
by
Ali
,
*NL*
who
carried
a
rose-colored
flambeau
in
his
hand
,
the
new-comer
,
who
was
*NL*
no
other
than
the
lovely
Greek
who
had
been
Monte
Cristo
's
companion
in
*NL*
Italy
,
was
conducted
to
her
apartments
,
while
the
count
retired
to
the
*NL*
pavilion
reserved
for
himself
.
In
another
hour
every
light
in
the
house
*NL*
was
extinguished
,
and
it
might
have
been
thought
that
all
its
inmates
*NL*
slept
.

About
two
o'clock
the
following
day
a
calash
,
drawn
by
a
pair
of
*NL*
magnificent
English
horses
,
stopped
at
the
door
of
Monte
Cristo
and
a
*NL*
person
,
dressed
in
a
blue
coat
,
with
buttons
of
a
similar
color

a
*NL*
white
waistcoat
,
over
which
was
displayed
a

brown

descending
so
low
over
his
*NL*
eyebrows
as
to
leave
it
doubtful
whether
it
were
not
artificial
so
*NL*
little
did
its
jetty
glossiness
assimilate
with
the
deep
wrinkles
*NL*
stamped
on
his
features
--
a
person
,
in
a
word
,
who
,
although
evidently
*NL*
past
fifty
,
desired
to
be
taken
for
not
more
than
forty
,
bent
forwards
*NL*
from
the
carriage
door
,
on
the
panels
of
which
were
emblazoned
the
*NL*
armorial
bearings
of
a
baron
,
and
directed
his
groom
to
inquire
at
the
*NL*
porter
's
lodge
whether
the
Count
of
Monte
Cristo
resided
there
,
and
if
*NL*
he
were
within
.
While
waiting
,
the
occupant
of
the
carriage
surveyed
the
*NL*
house
,
the
garden
as
far
as
he
could
distinguish
it
,
and
the
livery
*NL*
of
servants
who
passed
to
and
fro
,
with
an
attention
so
close
as
to
be
*NL*
somewhat
impertinent
.
His
glance
was
keen
but
showed
cunning
rather
than
*NL*
intelligence
;
his
lips
were
straight
,
and
so
thin
that
,
as
they
closed
,
*NL*
they
were
drawn
in
over
the
teeth
;
his
cheek-bones
were
broad
and
*NL*
projecting
,
a
never-failing
proof
of
audacity
and
craftiness
;
while
the
*NL*
flatness
of
his
forehead
,
and
the
enlargement
of
the
back
of
his
skull
,
*NL*
which
rose
much
higher
than
his
large
and
coarsely
shaped
ears
,
combined
*NL*
to
form
a
physiognomy
anything
but
prepossessing
,
save
in
the
eyes
of
*NL*
such
as
considered
that
the
owner
of
so
splendid
an
equipage
must
needs
*NL*
be
all
that
was
admirable
and
enviable
,
more
especially
when
they
gazed
*NL*
on
the
enormous
diamond
that
glittered
in
his
shirt
,
and
the
red
ribbon
*NL*
that
depended
from
his
button-hole
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
groom
,
in
obedience
to
his
orders
,
tapped
at
the
window
of
the
*NL*
porter
's
lodge
,
saying
,
``
Pray
,
does
not
the
Count
of
Monte
Cristo
live
*NL*
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
His
excellency
does
reside
here
,
''
replied
the
concierge
;
``
but
''
--
added
*NL*
he
,
glancing
an
inquiring
look
at
Ali
.
Ali
returned
a
sign
in
the
*NL*
negative
.
``
But
what
?
''
asked
the
groom
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
His
excellency
does
not
receive
visitors
to-day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
here
is
my
master
's
card
,
--
the
Baron
Danglars
.
You
will
take
it
*NL*
to
the
count
,
and
say
that
,
although
in
haste
to
attend
the
Chamber
,
my
*NL*
master
came
out
of
his
way
to
have
the
honor
of
calling
upon
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
speak
to
his
excellency
,
''
replied
the
concierge
;
``
the
valet
de
*NL*
chambre
will
carry
your
message
.
''
The
groom
returned
to
the
carriage
.
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
asked
Danglars
.
The
man
,
somewhat
crest-fallen
by
the
rebuke
he
*NL*
had
received
,
repeated
what
the
concierge
had
said
.
``
Bless
me
,
''
murmured
*NL*
Baron
Danglars
,
``
this
must
surely
be
a
prince
instead
of
a
count
by
*NL*
their
styling
him
`
excellency
,
'
and
only
venturing
to
address
him
by
the
*NL*
medium
of
his
valet
de
chambre
.
However
,
it
does
not
signify
;
he
has
a
*NL*
letter
of
credit
on
me
,
so
I
must
see
him
when
he
requires
his
money
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
throwing
himself
back
in
his
carriage
,
Danglars
called
out
to
*NL*
his
coachman
,
in
a
voice
that
might
be
heard
across
the
road
,
``
To
the
*NL*
Chamber
of
Deputies
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Apprised
in
time
of
the
visit
paid
him
,
Monte
Cristo
had
,
from
behind
*NL*
the
blinds
of
his
pavilion
,
as
minutely
observed
the
baron
,
by
means
of
*NL*
an
excellent
lorgnette
,
as
Danglars
himself
had
scrutinized
the
house
,
*NL*
garden
,
and
servants
.
``
That
fellow
has
a
decidedly
bad
countenance
,
''
*NL*
said
the
count
in
a
tone
of
disgust
,
as
he
shut
up
his
glass
into
its
*NL*
ivory
case
.
``
How
comes
it
that
all
do
not
retreat
in
aversion
at
sight
*NL*
of
that
flat
,
receding
,
serpent-like
forehead
,
round
,
vulture-shaped
*NL*
head
,
and
sharp-hooked
nose
,
like
the
beak
of
a
buzzard
?
Ali
,
''
cried
*NL*
he
,
striking
at
the
same
time
on
the
brazen
gong
.
Ali
appeared
.
``
Summon
*NL*
Bertuccio
,
''
said
the
count
.
Almost
immediately
Bertuccio
entered
the
*NL*
apartment
.
``
Did
your
excellency
desire
to
see
me
?
''
inquired
he
.
``
I
did
,
''
*NL*
replied
the
count
.
``
You
no
doubt
observed
the
horses
standing
a
few
*NL*
minutes
since
at
the
door

*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly

your

I
noticed
them

remarkable

beauty

*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
how
comes
it
,
''
said
Monte
Cristo
with
a
frown
,
``
that
,
when
I
*NL*
desired
you
to
purchase
for
me
the
finest
pair
of
horses
to
be
found

Paris
,
there
is
another
pair
,
fully
as
fine
as
mine
,
not
in
my
stables
?
''
*NL*
At
the
look
of
displeasure
,
added
to
the
angry
tone
in
which
the
count
*NL*
spoke
,
Ali
turned
pale
and
held
down
his
head
.
``
It
is
not
your
fault
,
my
*NL*
good
Ali
,
''
said
the
count
in
the
Arabic
language
,
and
with
a
gentleness
*NL*
none
would
have
thought
him
capable
of
showing
,
either
in
voice
or
*NL*
face
--
``
it
is
not
your
fault
.
You
do
not
understand
the
points
of
English
*NL*
horses
.
''
The
countenance
of
poor
Ali
recovered
its
serenity
.
``
Permit
me
*NL*
to
assure
your
excellency
,
''
said
Bertuccio
,
``
that
the
horses
you
speak
*NL*
of
were
not
to
be
sold
when
I
purchased
yours
.
''
Monte
Cristo
shrugged
*NL*
his
shoulders
.
``
It
seems
,
sir
steward
,
''
said
he
,
``
that
you
have
yet
to
*NL*
learn
that
all

price

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
His
excellency
is
not
,
perhaps

aware

Danglars
gave
16,000
*NL*
francs
for
his

?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well

Then

doubling

*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
your

really
in

inquired
the
steward
.
Monte
*NL*
Cristo
regarded
the
person
who
durst
presume
to
doubt
his
words
with
*NL*
the
look
of
one
equally
surprised
and
displeased
.
``
I
have
to
pay
a
visit
*NL*
this
evening

replied
he
.
``
I
desire

*NL*
new

''
Bertuccio
bowed
,
and
*NL*
was
about
to
retire
;
but
when
he
reached
the
door
,
he
paused
,
and
then
*NL*
said
,
``
At
what
o'clock
does
your
excellency
wish
the
carriage
and
horses
*NL*
to
be
ready
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
five
o'clock
,
''
replied
the
count
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beg
your
excellency
's
pardon
,
''
interposed
the
steward
in
a
*NL*
deprecating
manner
,
``
for
venturing
to
observe
that
it
is
already
two
*NL*
o'clock
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
perfectly
aware
of
that
fact
,
''
answered
Monte
Cristo
calmly
.
Then
,
*NL*
turning
towards
Ali
,
he
said
,
``
Let
all
the
horses
in
my
stables
be
led
*NL*
before
the
windows
of
your

select
those
she
*NL*
prefers
for
her
carriage

Request
her
also
to
oblige
me
by
saying

whether
it
is
her
pleasure
to
dine
with
me
;
if
so
,
let
dinner
be
served
*NL*
in

apartments

Now
,
leave
me

Scarcely
had
Ali
disappeared
when
the
valet
entered
the
*NL*
chamber
.
``
Monsieur
Baptistin

said
the
count
,
``
you

generally
give
myself
to

merits

demerits
of
those
about
me

You
suit
me
very
well

Baptistin
*NL*
bowed
low
.
``
It
only
remains
for
me
to
know
whether
I
also
suit
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

your
excellency

exclaimed
Baptistin
eagerly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
,
if
you
please
,
till
I

finished
speaking

replied
Monte
*NL*
Cristo
.
``
You
receive
1,500
francs
per

more
*NL*
than
many
a
brave
subaltern

who
continually
risks
his
life
for
his

obtains

You
live
in
a
manner
far
superior
to
many
clerks

*NL*
work
ten
times
harder
than
you
do
for
their

Then
,
though
yourself
*NL*
a
servant

you
have
other

wait
upon
you

take
care
of
your

see
that
your
linen
is
duly
prepared
for
you

Again
,
you
*NL*
make
a
profit
upon
each
article
you
purchase
for
my
toilet

amounting
in
*NL*
the
course
of
a
year

a
sum
equalling
your

*NL*
``
Nay

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

end
here

would
be
long
indeed
ere
you
would
find
so
*NL*
lucrative
a
post
as
that
you
have
now
the
good
fortune
to
fill

I
*NL*
neither
ill-use

ill-treat
my

by
word

An
error
*NL*
I
readily
forgive

but
wilful
negligence

forgetfulness

never

My
*NL*
commands
are
ordinarily
short

clear

precise

I
would
rather
be

obliged
to
repeat
my

twice

three

Baptistin
bowed
,
and
*NL*
was
proceeding
towards
the
door
.
``
I
forgot
to
mention
to
you
,
''
said
the
*NL*
count
,
``
that

aside

*NL*
*NL*
This
address
,
delivered
in
the
presence
of
Ali
,
who
,
not
understanding
*NL*
one
word
of
the
language
in
which
it
was
spoken
,
stood
wholly
unmoved
,
*NL*
produced
an
effect
on
M.
Baptistin
only
to
be
conceived
by
such
as
have
*NL*
occasion
to
study
the
character
and
disposition
of
French
domestics
.
``
I
*NL*
assure
your
excellency

''
said
he
,
``
that
at
least
it
shall
be
my
study
*NL*

merit
your
approbation

take
M.

as
my

model

*NL*
*NL*
``
By

replied
the
count
in
the
most
frigid
tones

``
Ali

He

pattern
for
your
conduct
,
not
being
,
as
you
are
,
a
paid
servant
,
*NL*
but
a
mere
slave
--
a
dog
,
who
,
should
he
fail
in
his
duty
towards
me
,
I
*NL*
should
not
discharge
from
my
service

''
Baptistin
opened
his
*NL*
eyes
with
astonishment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
seem
incredulous
,
''
said
Monte
Cristo
,
who
repeated
to
Ali
in
the
*NL*
Arabic
language
what
he
had
just
been
saying
to
Baptistin
in
French
.
The
*NL*
Nubian
smiled
assentingly
to
his
master
's
words
,
then
,
kneeling
on
one
*NL*
knee
,
respectfully
kissed
the
hand
of
the
count
.
This
corroboration
of
*NL*
the
lesson
he
had
just
received
put
the
finishing
stroke
to
the
wonder
*NL*
and
stupefaction
of
M.
Baptistin
.
The
count
then
motioned
the
valet
*NL*
de
chambre
to
retire
,
and
to
Ali
to
follow
to
his
study
,
where
they
*NL*
conversed
long
and
earnestly
together
.
As
the
hand
of
the
clock
pointed
*NL*
to
five
the
count
struck
thrice
upon
his
gong
.
When
Ali
was
wanted
*NL*
one
stroke
was
given
,
two
summoned
Baptistin
,
and
three
Bertuccio
.
The
*NL*
steward
entered
.
``
My
horses

said
Monte

.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

the
coachman

Ali

Baptistin
will
go

The
count
descended
to
*NL*
the
door
of
his
mansion
,
and
beheld
his
carriage
drawn
by
the
very
*NL*
pair
of
horses
he
had
so
much
admired
in
the
morning
as
the
property
*NL*
of
Danglars

As
he
passed
them
he
said

his

''
This
*NL*
conversation
had
passed
as
they
stood
upon
the
terrace
,
from
which
a
*NL*
flight
of
stone
steps
led
to
the
carriage-drive
.
As
Bertuccio
,
with
*NL*
a
respectful
bow
,
was
moving
away
,
the
count
called
him
back
.
``
I
have
*NL*
another
commission
for
you
,
M.
Bertuccio
,
''
said
he
;
``
I
am
desirous
of
*NL*
having
an
estate
by
the
seaside
in
Normandy
--
for
instance
,
between
Havre
*NL*
and
Boulogne
.
You
see
I
give
you
a
wide
range
.
It
will
be
absolutely
*NL*
necessary
that
the
place
you
may
select
have
a
small
harbor
,
creek
,
or
*NL*
bay
,
into
which
my
corvette
can
enter
and
remain
at
anchor
.
She
draws
*NL*
only
fifteen
feet
.
She
must
be
kept
in
constant
readiness
to
sail
*NL*
immediately
I
think
proper
to
give
the
signal
.
Make
the
requisite
*NL*
inquiries
for
a
place
of
this
description
,
and
when
you
have
met
with
*NL*
an
eligible
spot
,
visit
it
,
and
if
it
possess
the
advantages
desired
,
*NL*
purchase
it
at
once
in
your
own
name
.
The
corvette
must
now
,
I
think
,
be
*NL*
on
her
way
to
Fecamp
,
must
she
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
,
your
excellency
;
I
saw
her
put
to
sea
the
same
evening
we
*NL*
quitted
Marseilles
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
the
yacht
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
ordered
to
remain
at
Martigues
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
well
.
I
wish
you
to
write
from
time
to
time
to
the
captains
in
*NL*
charge
of
the
two
vessels
so
as
to
keep
them
on
the
alert
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
the
steamboat
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
at
Chalons
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
same
orders
for
her
as
for
the
two
sailing
vessels
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
good
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
you
have
purchased
the
estate
I
desire
,
I
want
constant
relays
of
*NL*
horses
at
ten
leagues
apart
along
the
northern
and
southern
road
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
excellency
may
depend
upon
me
.
''
The
Count
made
a
gesture
of
*NL*
satisfaction
,
descended
the
terrace
steps
,
and
sprang
into
his
carriage
,
*NL*
which
was
whirled
along
swiftly
to
the
banker
's
house
.
Danglars
was
*NL*
engaged
at
that
moment
,
presiding
over
a
railroad
committee
.
But
the
*NL*
meeting
was
nearly
concluded
when
the
name
of
his
visitor
was
announced
.
*NL*
As
the
count
's
title
sounded
on
his
ear
he
rose
,
and
addressing
*NL*
his
colleagues
,
who
were
members
of
one
or
the
other
Chamber
,
he
*NL*
said
,
--
``
Gentlemen
,
pardon
me
for
leaving
you
so
abruptly
;
but
a
most
*NL*
ridiculous
circumstance
has
occurred
,
which
is
this
,
--
Thomson
&
French
,
*NL*
the
Roman
bankers
,
have
sent
to
me
a
certain
person
calling
himself
the
*NL*
Count
of
Monte
Cristo
,
and
have
given
him
an
unlimited
credit
with
me
.
I
*NL*
confess
this
is
the
drollest
thing
I
have
ever
met
with
in
the
course
*NL*
of
my
extensive
foreign
transactions
,
and
you
may
readily
suppose
it
has
*NL*
greatly
roused
my
curiosity
.
I
took
the
trouble
this
morning
to
call
*NL*
on
the
pretended
count
--
if
he
were
a
real
count
he
would
n't
be
so
rich
.
*NL*
But
,
would
you
believe
it
,
`
He
was
not
receiving
.
'
So
the
master
of
*NL*
Monte
Cristo
gives
himself
airs
befitting
a
great
millionaire
or
a
*NL*
capricious
beauty
.
I
made
inquiries
,
and
found
that
the
house
in
the
*NL*
Champs
Elysees
is
his
own
property
,
and
certainly
it
was
very
decently
*NL*
kept
up
.
But
,
''
pursued
Danglars
with
one
of
his
sinister
smiles
,
``
an
*NL*
order
for
unlimited
credit
calls
for
something
like
caution
on
the
part
*NL*
of
the
banker
to
whom
that
order
is
given
.
I
am
very
anxious
to
see
this
*NL*
man
.
I
suspect
a
hoax
is
intended
,
but
the
instigators
of
it
little
knew
*NL*
whom
they
had
to
deal
with
.
`
They
laugh
best
who
laugh
last
!
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
Having
delivered
himself
of
this
pompous
address
,
uttered
with
a
degree
*NL*
of
energy
that
left
the
baron
almost
out
of
breath
,
he
bowed
to
the
*NL*
assembled
party
and
withdrew
to
his
drawing-room
,
whose
sumptuous
*NL*
furnishings
of
white
and
gold
had
caused
a
great
sensation
in
the
*NL*
Chaussee
d'Antin
.
It
was
to
this
apartment
he
had
desired
his
guest
to
*NL*
be
shown
,
with
the
purpose
of
overwhelming
him
at
the
sight
of
so
much
*NL*
luxury
.
He
found
the
count
standing
before
some
copies
of
Albano
and
*NL*
Fattore
that
had
been
passed
off
to
the
banker
as
originals
;
but
which
,
*NL*
mere
copies
as
they
were
,
seemed
to
feel
their
degradation
in
being
*NL*
brought
into
juxtaposition
with
the
gaudy
colors
that
covered
the
*NL*
ceiling
.
The
count
turned
round
as
he
heard
the
entrance
of
Danglars
*NL*
into
the
room
.
With
a
slight
inclination
of
the
head
,
Danglars
signed
*NL*
to
the
count
to
be
seated
,
pointing
significantly
to
a
gilded
arm-chair
,
*NL*
covered
with
white
satin
embroidered
with
gold
.
The
count
sat
down
.
``
I
*NL*
have
the
honor
,
I
presume
,
of
addressing
M.
de
Monte
Cristo
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
count
bowed
.
``
And
I
of
speaking
to
Baron
Danglars
,
chevalier
of
the
*NL*
Legion
of
Honor
,
and
member
of
the
Chamber
of
Deputies
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Monte
Cristo
repeated
all
the
titles
he
had
read
on
the
baron
's
card
.
*NL*
*NL*
Danglars
felt
the
irony
and
compressed
his
lips
.
``
You
will
,
I
trust
,
*NL*
excuse
me
,
monsieur
,
for
not
calling
you
by
your
title
when
I
first
*NL*
addressed
you
,
''
he
said
,
``
but
you
are
aware
that
we
are
living
under
a
*NL*
popular
form
of
government
,
and
that
I
am
myself
a
representative
of
the
*NL*
liberties
of
the
people
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
much
so
,
''
replied
Monte
Cristo
,
``
that
while
you
call
yourself
baron
*NL*
you
are
not
willing
to
call
anybody
else
count
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Upon
my
word
,
monsieur
,
''
said
Danglars
with
affected
carelessness
,
``
I
*NL*
attach
no
sort
of
value
to
such
empty
distinctions
;
but
the
fact
is
,
I
*NL*
was
made
baron
,
and
also
chevalier
of
the
Legion
of
Honor
,
in
return
for
*NL*
services
rendered
,
but
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
have
discarded
your
titles
after
the
example
set
you
by
Messrs.
*NL*
de
Montmorency
and
Lafayette
?
That
was
a
noble
example
to
follow
,
*NL*
monsieur
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
''
replied
Danglars
,
``
not
entirely
so
;
with
the
servants
,
--
you
*NL*
understand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
;
to
your
domestics
you
are
`
my
lord
,
'
the
journalists
style
*NL*
you
`
monsieur
,
'
while
your
constituents
call
you
`
citizen
.
'
These
*NL*
are
distinctions
very
suitable
under
a
constitutional
government
.
I
*NL*
understand
perfectly
.
''
Again
Danglars
bit
his
lips
;
he
saw
that
he
was
*NL*
no
match
for
Monte
Cristo
in
an
argument
of
this
sort
,
and
he
therefore
*NL*
hastened
to
turn
to
subjects
more
congenial
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Permit
me
to
inform
you
,
Count
,
''
said
he
,
bowing
,
``
that
I
have
received
*NL*
a
letter
of
advice
from
Thomson
&
French
,
of
Rome
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
glad
to
hear
it
,
baron
,
--
for
I
must
claim
the
privilege
of
*NL*
addressing
you
after
the
manner
of
your
servants
.
I
have
acquired
the
*NL*
bad
habit
of
calling
persons
by
their
titles
from
living
in
a
country
*NL*
where
barons
are
still
barons
by
right
of
birth
.
But
as
regards
the
*NL*
letter
of
advice
,
I
am
charmed
to
find
that
it
has
reached
you
;
that
*NL*
will
spare
me
the
troublesome
and
disagreeable
task
of
coming
to
you
for
*NL*
money
myself
.
You
have
received
a
regular
letter
of
advice
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Danglars
,
``
but
I
confess
I
did
n't
quite
comprehend
its
*NL*
meaning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
for
that
reason
I
did
myself
the
honor
of
calling
upon
you
,
in
*NL*
order
to
beg
for
an
explanation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
on
,
monsieur
.
Here
I
am
,
ready
to
give
you
any
explanation
you
*NL*
desire

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
''
said
Danglers
,
``
in
the
letter
--
I
believe
I
have
it
about
*NL*
me
''
--
here
he
felt
in
his
breast-pocket
--
``
yes
,
here
it
is
.
Well
,
this
*NL*
letter
gives
the
Count
of
Monte
Cristo
unlimited
credit
on
our
house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
baron
,
what
is
there
difficult
to
understand
about
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Merely
the
term
unlimited
--
nothing
else
,
certainly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
not
that
word
known
in
France
?
The
people
who
wrote
are
*NL*
Anglo-Germans
,
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
as
for
the
composition
of
the
letter
,
there
is
nothing
to
be
said
;
*NL*
but
as
regards
the
competency
of
the
document
,
I
certainly
have
doubts
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
possible
?
''
asked
the
count
,
assuming
all
air
and
tone
of
the
*NL*
utmost
simplicity
and
candor
.
``
Is
it
possible
that
Thomson
&
French
*NL*
are
not
looked
upon
as
safe
and
solvent
bankers
?
Pray
tell
me
what
*NL*
you
think
,
baron
,
for
I
feel
uneasy
,
I
can
assure
you
,
having
some
*NL*
considerable
property
in
their
hands
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thomson
&
French
are
perfectly
solvent
,
''
replied
Danglars
,
with
an
*NL*
almost
mocking
smile
:
``
but
the
word
unlimited
,
in
financial
affairs
,
is
*NL*
so
extremely
vague
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
,
in
fact
,
unlimited
,
''
said
Monte
Cristo
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Precisely
what
I
was
about
to
say
,
''
cried
Danglars
.
``
Now
what
is
vague
*NL*
is
doubtful
;
and
it
was
a
wise
man
who
said
,
`
when
in
doubt
,
keep
out
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Meaning
to
say
,
''
rejoined
Monte
Cristo
,
``
that
however
Thomson
&
French
*NL*
may
be
inclined
to
commit
acts
of
imprudence
and
folly
,
the
Baron
*NL*
Danglars
is
not
disposed
to
follow
their
example
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Plainly
enough
.
Messrs.
Thomson
&
French
set
no
bounds
to
their
*NL*
engagements
while
those
of
M.
Danglars
have
their
limits
;
he
is
a
wise
*NL*
man
,
according
to
his
own
showing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
,
''
replied
the
banker
,
drawing
himself
up
with
a
haughty
air
,
*NL*
``
the
extent
of
my
resources
has
never
yet
been
questioned
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
seems
,
then
,
reserved
for
me
,
''
said
Monte
Cristo
coldly
,
``
to
be
the
*NL*
first
to
do
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
what
right
,
sir
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
right
of
the
objections
you
have
raised
,
and
the
explanations
you
*NL*
have
demanded
,
which
certainly
must
have
some
motive
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Once
more
Danglars
bit
his
lips
.
It
was
the
second
time
he
had
been
*NL*
worsted
,
and
this
time
on
his
own
ground
.
His
forced
politeness
sat
*NL*
awkwardly
upon
him
,
and
approached
almost
to
impertinence
.
Monte
Cristo
*NL*
on
the
contrary
,
preserved
a
graceful
suavity
of
demeanor
,
aided
by
*NL*
a
certain
degree
of
simplicity
he
could
assume
at
pleasure
,
and
thus
*NL*
possessed
the
advantage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
sir
,
''
resumed
Danglars
,
after
a
brief
silence
,
``
I
will
endeavor
*NL*
to
make
myself
understood
,
by
requesting
you
to
inform
me
for
what
sum
*NL*
you
propose
to
draw
upon
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
truly
,
''
replied
Monte
Cristo
,
determined
not
to
lose
an
inch
of
*NL*
the
ground
he
had
gained
,
``
my
reason
for
desiring
an
`
unlimited
'
credit
*NL*
was
precisely
because
I
did
not
know
how
much
money
I
might
need
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
banker
thought
the
time
had
come
for
him
to
take
the
upper
hand
.
So
*NL*
throwing
himself
back
in
his
arm-chair
,
he
said
,
with
an
arrogant
and
*NL*
purse-proud
air
,
--
``
Let
me
beg
of
you
not
to
hesitate
in
naming
your
*NL*
wishes
;
you
will
then
be
convinced
that
the
resources
of
the
house
*NL*
of
Danglars
,
however
limited
,
are
still
equal
to
meeting
the
largest
*NL*
demands
;
and
were
you
even
to
require
a
million
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beg
your
pardon
,
''
interposed
Monte
Cristo
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
said
a
million
,
''
replied
Danglars
,
with
the
confidence
of
ignorance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
could
I
do
with
a
million
?
''
retorted
the
count
.
``
My
dear
sir
,
if
a
*NL*
trifle
like
that
could
suffice
me
,
I
should
never
have
given
myself
the
*NL*
trouble
of
opening
an
account
.
A
million
?
Excuse
my
smiling
when
you
*NL*
speak
of
a
sum
I
am
in
the
habit
of
carrying
in
my
pocket-book
or
*NL*
dressing-case
.
''
And
with
these
words
Monte
Cristo
took
from
his
pocket
*NL*
a
small
case
containing
his
visiting-cards
,
and
drew
forth
two
orders
on
*NL*
the
treasury
for
500,000
francs
each
,
payable
at
sight
to
the
bearer
.
*NL*
A
man
like
Danglars
was
wholly
inaccessible
to
any
gentler
method
*NL*
of
correction
.
The
effect
of
the
present
revelation
was
stunning
;
he
*NL*
trembled
and
was
on
the
verge
of
apoplexy
.
The
pupils
of
his
eyes
,
as
he
*NL*
gazed
at
Monte
Cristo
dilated
horribly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
come
,
''
said
Monte
Cristo
,
``
confess
honestly
that
you
have
not
*NL*
perfect
confidence
in
Thomson
&
French
.
I
understand
,
and
foreseeing
*NL*
that
such
might
be
the
case
,
I
took
,
in
spite
of
my
ignorance
of
*NL*
affairs
,
certain
precautions
.
See
,
here
are
two
similar
letters
to
that
*NL*
you
have
yourself
received
;
one
from
the
house
of
Arstein
&
Eskeles
of
*NL*
Vienna
,
to
Baron
Rothschild
,
the
other
drawn
by
Baring
of
London
,
upon
*NL*
M.
Laffitte
.
Now
,
sir
,
you
have
but
to
say
the
word
,
and
I
will
spare
*NL*
you
all
uneasiness
by
presenting
my
letter
of
credit
to
one
or
other
of
*NL*
these
two
firms
.
''
The
blow
had
struck
home
,
and
Danglars
was
entirely
*NL*
vanquished
;
with
a
trembling
hand
he
took
the
two
letters
from
the
*NL*
count
,
who
held
them
carelessly
between
finger
and
thumb
,
and
proceeded
*NL*
to
scrutinize
the
signatures
,
with
a
minuteness
that
the
count
might
*NL*
have
regarded
as
insulting
,
had
it
not
suited
his
present
purpose
to
*NL*
mislead
the
banker
.
``
Oh
,
sir
,
''
said
Danglars
,
after
he
had
convinced
*NL*
himself
of
the
authenticity
of
the
documents
he
held
,
and
rising
as
if
*NL*
to
salute
the
power
of
gold
personified
in
the
man
before
him
,
--
``
three
*NL*
letters
of
unlimited
credit
!
I
can
be
no
longer
mistrustful
,
but
*NL*
you
must
pardon
me
,
my
dear
count
,
for
confessing
to
some
degree
of
*NL*
astonishment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
''
answered
Monte
Cristo
,
with
the
most
gentlemanly
air
,
''
't
is
*NL*
not
for
such
trifling
sums
as
these
that
your
banking
house
is
to
be
*NL*
incommoded
.
Then
,
you
can
let
me
have
some
money
,
can
you
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whatever
you
say
,
my
dear
count
;
I
am
at
your
orders
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
''
replied
Monte
Cristo
,
``
since
we
mutually
understand
each
*NL*
other
--
for
such
I
presume
is
the
case
?
''
Danglars
bowed
assentingly
.
``
You
*NL*
are
quite
sure
that
not
a
lurking
doubt
or
suspicion
lingers
in
your
*NL*
mind
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
dear
count
,
''
exclaimed
Danglars
,
``
I
never
for
an
instant
*NL*
entertained
such
a
feeling
towards
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
you
merely
wished
to
be
convinced
,
nothing
more
;
but
now
that
*NL*
we
have
come
to
so
clear
an
understanding
,
and
that
all
distrust
and
*NL*
suspicion
are
laid
at
rest
,
we
may
as
well
fix
a
sum
as
the
probable
*NL*
expenditure
of
the
first
year
,
suppose
we
say
six
millions
to
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Six
millions

gasped
Danglars
--
``
so
be
it
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
if
I
should
require
more
,
''
continued
Monte
Cristo
in
a
careless
*NL*
manner
,
``
why
,
of
course
,
I
should
draw
upon
you
;
but
my
present
*NL*
intention
is
not
to
remain
in
France
more
than
a
year
,
and
during
that
*NL*
period
I
scarcely
think
I
shall
exceed
the
sum
I
mentioned
.
However
,
we
*NL*
shall
see

Be
kind
enough
,
then
,
to
send
me
500,000

shall
be

not

Danglars

``
How
would
you
like
to
have
*NL*
it

in

*NL*
``

*NL*
the
count

rising
from
his
seat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
confess
to
you

said
Danglars
,
``
that
I
have
hitherto
*NL*
imagined
myself
acquainted
with
the
degree
of
all
the
great
fortunes
of
*NL*
Europe
,
and
still
wealth
such
as
yours
has
been
wholly
unknown
to
me

*NL*
May
I
presume
to
ask
whether
you
have
long
possessed
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
has
been
in
the
family
a
very
long
while

returned
Monte
Cristo
,
``
a
*NL*
sort
of
treasure
expressly
forbidden
to
be
touched
for
a
certain
period
*NL*
of
years
,
during
which
the
accumulated
interest
has
doubled
the
capital
.
*NL*
The
period
appointed
by
the
testator
for
the
disposal
of
these
riches
*NL*
occurred
only
a
short
time
ago
,
and
they
have
only
been
employed
by
me
*NL*
within
the
last
few
years
.
Your
ignorance
on
the
subject

therefore

is
*NL*
easily
accounted
for

However

you
will
be
better
informed
as
to
me

*NL*
my
possessions
ere
long
.
''
And
the
count
,
while
pronouncing
these
latter
*NL*
words
,
accompanied
them
with
one
of
those
ghastly
smiles
that
used
to
*NL*
strike
terror
into
poor
Franz
d'Epinay
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
your
tastes

and
means
of
gratifying
them

continued
Danglars
,
*NL*
``
you
will
exhibit
a
splendor
that
must
effectually
put
us
poor
miserable
*NL*
millionaires
quite
in
the
shade

If
I
mistake
not
you
are
an
admirer
of
*NL*
paintings
,
at
least
I
judged
so
from
the
attention
you
appeared
to
be

bestowing
on
mine

I
entered
the
room

If

I
can
not
endure
the
modern

*NL*
``
You
are
perfectly
right

objecting
to

this
one

I
will
confine
myself

perfectly
agreeable
to

you

to
introducing
you
to
the
Baroness
Danglars

excuse
my

*NL*
my

Monte
Cristo
bowed
,
in
sign
that
he
accepted
the
proffered
*NL*
honor
;
Danglars
rang
and
was
answered
by
a
servant
in
a
showy
livery
.
*NL*
``
Is

inquired
Danglars

Monte

with
a
smile
,
``
I
do
not

the
right
of
so
doing

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
who
is
with

inquired
Danglars
,
with
an
air
of
*NL*
indulgence
and
good-nature
that
made
Monte
Cristo
smile
,
acquainted
as
*NL*
he
was
with
the
secrets
of
the
banker

domestic
life

*NL*

the

Danglars
nodded
his
head
;
then
,
turning
to
Monte

,
said
,
``
M.

As
for
my

I
must
tell
you

she
lowered

herself

Chapter

.
The
Dappled
Grays
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
baron
,
followed
by
the
count
,
traversed
a
long
series
of
apartments
,
*NL*
in
which
the
prevailing
characteristics
were
heavy
magnificence
and
the
*NL*
gaudiness
of
ostentatious
wealth
,
until
he
reached
the
boudoir
of
Madame
*NL*
Danglars
--
a
small
octagonal-shaped
room
,
hung
with
pink
satin
,
covered
*NL*
with
white
Indian
muslin
.
The
chairs
were
of
ancient
workmanship
*NL*
and
materials
;
over
the
doors
were
painted
sketches
of
shepherds
and
*NL*
shepherdesses
,
after
the
style
and
manner
of
Boucher
;
and
at
each
side
*NL*
pretty
medallions
in
crayons
,
harmonizing
well
with
the
furnishings
of
*NL*
this
charming
apartment
,
the
only
one
throughout
the
great
mansion
*NL*
in
which
any
distinctive
taste
prevailed
.
The
truth
was
,
it
had
been
*NL*
entirely
overlooked
in
the
plan
arranged
and
followed
out
by
M.
Danglars
*NL*
and
his
architect
,
who
had
been
selected
to
aid
the
baron
in
the
great
*NL*
work
of
improvement
solely
because
he
was
the
most
fashionable
and
*NL*
celebrated
decorator
of
the
day
.
The
decorations
of
the
boudoir
had
then
*NL*
been
left
entirely
to
Madame
Danglars
and
Lucien
Debray
.
M.
Danglars
,
*NL*
however
,
while
possessing
a
great
admiration
for
the
antique
,
as
it
*NL*
was
understood
during
the
time
of
the
Directory
,
entertained
the
most
*NL*
sovereign
contempt
for
the
simple
elegance
of
his
wife
's
favorite
*NL*
sitting-room
,
where
,
by
the
way
,
he
was
never
permitted
to
intrude
,
*NL*
unless
,
indeed
,
he
excused
his
own
appearance
by
ushering
in
some
more
*NL*
agreeable
visitor
than
himself
;
and
even
then
he
had
rather
the
air
and
*NL*
manner
of
a
person
who
was
himself
introduced
,
than
that
of
being
*NL*
the
presenter
of
another
,
his
reception
being
cordial
or
frigid
,
in
*NL*
proportion
as
the
person
who
accompanied
him
chanced
to
please
or
*NL*
displease
the
baroness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Danglars
-LRB-
who
,
although
past
the
first
bloom
of
youth
,
was
still
*NL*
strikingly
handsome
-RRB-
was
now
seated
at
the
piano
,
a
most
elaborate
piece
*NL*
of
cabinet
and
inlaid
work
,
while
Lucien
Debray
,
standing
before
a
small
*NL*
work-table
,
was
turning
over
the
pages
of
an
album
.
Lucien
had
found
*NL*
time
,
preparatory
to
the
count
's
arrival
,
to
relate
many
particulars
*NL*
respecting
him
to
Madame
Danglars
.
It
will
be
remembered
that
Monte
*NL*
Cristo
had
made
a
lively
impression
on
the
minds
of
all
the
party
*NL*
assembled
at
the
breakfast
given
by
Albert
de
Morcerf
;
and
although
*NL*
Debray
was
not
in
the
habit
of
yielding
to
such
feelings
,
he
had
never
*NL*
been
able
to
shake
off
the
powerful
influence
excited
in
his
mind
by
the
*NL*
impressive
look
and
manner
of
the
count
,
consequently
the
description
*NL*
given
by
Lucien
to
the
baroness
bore
the
highly-colored
tinge
of
his
own
*NL*
heated
imagination
.
Already
excited
by
the
wonderful
stories
related
of
*NL*
the
count
by
De
Morcerf
,
it
is
no
wonder
that
Madame
Danglars
eagerly
*NL*
listened
to
,
and
fully
credited
,
all
the
additional
circumstances
*NL*
detailed
by
Debray
.
This
posing
at
the
piano
and
over
the
album
was
only
*NL*
a
little
ruse
adopted
by
way
of
precaution
.
A
most
gracious
welcome
and
*NL*
unusual
smile
were
bestowed
on
M.
Danglars
;
the
count
,
in
return
for
*NL*
his
gentlemanly
bow
,
received
a
formal
though
graceful
courtesy
,
while
*NL*
Lucien
exchanged
with
the
count
a
sort
of
distant
recognition
,
and
with
*NL*
Danglars
a
free
and
easy
nod
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Baroness
,
''
said
Danglars
,
``
give
me
leave
to
present
to
you
the
Count
*NL*
of
Monte
Cristo
,
who
has
been
most
warmly
recommended
to
me
by
my
*NL*
correspondents
at
Rome
.
I
need
but
mention
one
fact
to
make
all
the
*NL*
ladies
in
Paris
court
his
notice
,
and
that
is
,
that
he
has
come
to
take
*NL*
up
his
abode
in
Paris
for
a
year
,
during
which
brief
period
he
proposes
*NL*
to
spend
six
millions
of
money
.
That
means
balls
,
dinners
,
and
lawn
*NL*
parties
without
end
,
in
all
of
which
I
trust
the
count
will
remember
*NL*
us
,
as
he
may
depend
upon
it
we
shall
him
,
in
our
own
humble
*NL*
entertainments

''
In
spite
of
the
gross
flattery
and
coarseness
of
this
*NL*
address
,
Madame
Danglars
could
not
forbear
gazing
with
considerable
*NL*
interest
on
a
man
capable
of
expending
six
millions
in
twelve
months
,
*NL*
and
who
had
selected
Paris
for
the
scene
of
his
princely
extravagance

morning
,
madame

*NL*
*NL*
``
Coming
,
as
usual
,
I
presume
,
from
the
extreme
end
of
the
globe
?
Pardon
*NL*
me
--
at
least
,
such
I
have
heard
is
your
custom
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
madame
.
This
time
I
have
merely
come
from
Cadiz
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
selected
a
most
unfavorable
moment
for
your
first
visit
.
Paris
*NL*
is
a
horrible
place
in
summer
.
Balls
,
parties
,
and
fetes
are
over
;
the
*NL*
Italian
opera
is
in
London
;
the
French
opera
everywhere
except
in
Paris
.
*NL*
As
for
the
Theatre
Francais
,
you
know
,
of
course
,
that
it
is
nowhere
.
*NL*
The
only
amusements
left
us
are
the
indifferent
races
at
the
Champ
de
*NL*
Mars
and
Satory
.
Do
you
propose
entering
any
horses
at
either
of
these
*NL*
races
,
count
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
do
whatever
they
do
at
Paris
,
madame
,
if
I
have
the
good
*NL*
fortune
to
find
some
one
who
will
initiate
me
into
the
prevalent
ideas
*NL*
of
amusement
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
fond
of
horses
,
count
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
passed
a
considerable
part
of
my
life
in
the
East
,
madame
,
and
*NL*
you
are
doubtless
aware
that
the
Orientals
value
only
two
things
--
the
*NL*
fine
breeding
of
their
horses
and
the
beauty
of
their
women
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
count
,
''
said
the
baroness
,
``
it
would
have
been
somewhat
more
*NL*
gallant
to
have
placed
the
ladies
first
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
madame
,
how
rightly
I
spoke
when
I
said
I
required
a
preceptor
*NL*
to
guide
me
in
all
my
sayings
and
doings
here
.
''
At
this
instant
the
*NL*
favorite
attendant
of
Madame
Danglars
entered
the
boudoir
;
approaching
*NL*
her
mistress
,
she
spoke
some
words
in
an
undertone
.
Madame
Danglars
*NL*
turned
very
pale
,
then
exclaimed
,
--
``
I
can
not
believe
it
;
the
thing
is
*NL*
impossible
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
assure
you
,
madame
,
''
replied
the
woman
,
``
it
is
as
I
have
said
.
''
*NL*
Turning
impatiently
towards
her
husband
,
Madame
Danglars
demanded
,
``
Is
*NL*
this
true
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
what
true
,
madame
?
''
inquired
Danglars
,
visibly
agitated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
my
maid
tells
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
does
she
tell
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
when
my
coachman
was
about
to
harness
the
horses
to
my
carriage
,
*NL*
he
discovered
that
they
had
been
removed
from
the
stables
without
his
*NL*
knowledge
.
I
desire
to
know
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
kind
enough
,
madame
,
to
listen
to
me
,
''
said
Danglars
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
;
I
will
listen
,
monsieur
,
for
I
am
most
curious
to
hear
what
*NL*
explanation
you
will
give
.
These
two
gentlemen
shall
decide
between
us
;
*NL*
but
,
first
,
I
will
state
the
case
to
them
.
Gentlemen
,
''
continued
the
*NL*
baroness
,
``
among
the
ten
horses
in
the
stables
of
Baron
Danglars
,
are
*NL*
two
that
belong
exclusively
to
me
--
a
pair
of
the
handsomest
and
most
*NL*
spirited
creatures
to
be
found
in
Paris
.
But
to
you
,
at
least
,
M.
*NL*
Debray
,
I
need
not
give
a
further
description
,
because
to
you
my
*NL*
beautiful
pair
of
dappled
grays
were
well
known
.
Well
,
I
had
promised
*NL*
Madame
de
Villefort
the
loan
of
my
carriage
to
drive
to-morrow
to
the
*NL*
Bois
;
but
when
my
coachman
goes
to
fetch
the
grays
from
the
stables
they
*NL*
are
gone
--
positively
gone
.
No
doubt
M.
Danglars
has
sacrificed
them
to
*NL*
the
selfish
consideration
of
gaining
some
thousands
of
paltry
francs
.
*NL*
Oh
,
what
a
detestable
crew
they
are
,
these
mercenary
speculators
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madame
,
''
replied
Danglars
,
``
the
horses
were
not
sufficiently
quiet
*NL*
for
you
;
they
were
scarcely
four
years
old
,
and
they
made
me
extremely
*NL*
uneasy
on
your
account
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nonsense
,
''
retorted
the
baroness
;
``
you
could
not
have
entertained
any
*NL*
alarm
on
the
subject
,
because
you
are
perfectly
well
aware
that
I
have
*NL*
had
for
a
month
in
my
service
the
very
best
coachman
in
Paris
.
But
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
you
have
disposed
of
the
coachman
as
well
as
the
horses
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
love
,
pray
do
not
say
any
more
about
them
,
and
I
promise
*NL*
you
another
pair
exactly
like
them
in
appearance
,
only
more
quiet
and
*NL*
steady
.
''
The
baroness
shrugged
her
shoulders
with
an
air
of
ineffable
*NL*
contempt
,
while
her
husband
,
affecting
not
to
observe
this
unconjugal
*NL*
gesture
,
turned
towards
Monte
Cristo
and
said
,
--
``
Upon
my
word
,
count
,
*NL*
I
am
quite
sorry
not
to
have
met
you
sooner
.
You
are
setting
up
an
*NL*
establishment
,
of
course
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
yes
,
''
replied
the
count
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
have
liked
to
have
made
you
the
offer
of
these
horses
.
I
have
*NL*
almost
given
them
away
,
as
it
is
;
but
,
as
I
before
said
,
I
was
anxious
*NL*
to
get
rid
of
them
upon
any
terms
.
They
were
only
fit
for
a
young
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
much
obliged
by
your
kind
intentions
towards
me
,
''
said
Monte
*NL*
Cristo
;
``
but
this
morning
I
purchased
a
very
excellent
pair
of
*NL*
carriage-horses
,
and
I
do
not
think
they
were
dear
.
There
they
are
.
*NL*
Come
,
M.
Debray
,
you
are
a
connoisseur
,
I
believe
,
let
me
have
your
*NL*
opinion
upon
them
.
''
As
Debray
walked
towards
the
window
,
Danglars
*NL*
approached
his
wife
.
``
I
could
not
tell
you
before
others
,
''
said
he
in
a
*NL*
low
tone
,
``
the
reason
of
my
parting
with
the
horses
;
but
a
most
enormous
*NL*
price
was
offered
me
this
morning
for
them
.
Some
madman
or
fool
,
bent
*NL*
upon
ruining
himself
as
fast
as
he
can
,
actually
sent
his
steward
to
*NL*
me
to
purchase
them
at
any
cost
;
and
the
fact
is
,
I
have
gained
16,000
*NL*
francs
by
the
sale
of
them
.
Come
,
do
n't
look
so
angry
,
and
you
shall
*NL*
have
4,000
francs
of
the
money
to
do
what
you
like
with
,
and
Eugenie
*NL*
shall
have
2,000
.
There
,
what
do
you
think
now
of
the
affair
?
Was
n't
*NL*
I
right
to
part
with
the
horses
?
''
Madame
Danglars
surveyed
her
husband
*NL*
with
a
look
of
withering
contempt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Great
heavens
?
''
suddenly
exclaimed
Debray
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
asked
the
baroness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
be
mistaken
;
there
are
your
horses
!
The
very
animals
we
were
*NL*
speaking
of
,
harnessed
to
the
count
's
carriage
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dappled
grays
?
''
demanded
the
baroness
,
springing
to
the
window
.
*NL*
''
'T
is
indeed
they
!
''
said
she
.
Danglars
looked
absolutely
stupefied
.
``
How
*NL*
very
singular
,
''
cried
Monte
Cristo
with
well-feigned
astonishment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
believe
it
,
''
murmured
the
banker
.
Madame
Danglars
whispered
*NL*
a
few
words
in
the
ear
of
Debray
,
who
approached
Monte
Cristo
,
saying
,
*NL*
``
The
baroness
wishes
to
know
what
you
paid
her
husband
for
the
horses
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
scarcely
know
,
''
replied
the
count
;
``
it
was
a
little
surprise
prepared
*NL*
for
me
by
my
steward
,
and
cost
me
--
well
,
somewhere
about
30,000
francs
.
''
*NL*
Debray
conveyed
the
count
's
reply
to
the
baroness
.
Poor
Danglars
looked
*NL*
so
crest-fallen
and
discomfited
that
Monte
Cristo
assumed
a
pitying
air
*NL*
towards
him
.
``
See
,
''
said
the
count
,
``
how
very
ungrateful
women
are
.
Your
*NL*
kind
attention
,
in
providing
for
the
safety
of
the
baroness
by
disposing
*NL*
of
the
horses
,
does
not
seem
to
have
made
the
least
impression
on
her
.
*NL*
But
so
it
is
;
a
woman
will
often
,
from
mere
wilfulness
,
prefer
that
*NL*
which
is
dangerous
to
that
which
is
safe
.
Therefore
,
in
my
opinion
,
my
*NL*
dear
baron
,
the
best
and
easiest
way
is
to
leave
them
to
their
fancies
,
*NL*
and
allow
them
to
act
as
they
please
,
and
then
,
if
any
mischief
follows
,
*NL*
why
,
at
least
,
they
have
no
one
to
blame
but
themselves
.
''
Danglars
made
*NL*
no
reply
;
he
was
occupied
in
anticipations
of
the
coming
scene
between
*NL*
himself
and
the
baroness
,
whose
frowning
brow
,
like
that
of
Olympic
*NL*
Jove
,
predicted
a
storm
.
Debray
,
who
perceived
the
gathering
clouds
,
*NL*
and
felt
no
desire
to
witness
the
explosion
of
Madame
Danglars
'
rage
,
*NL*
suddenly
recollected
an
appointment
,
which
compelled
him
to
take
his
*NL*
leave
;
while
Monte
Cristo
,
unwilling
by
prolonging
his
stay
to
destroy
*NL*
the
advantages
he
hoped
to
obtain
,
made
a
farewell
bow
and
departed
,
*NL*
leaving
Danglars
to
endure
the
angry
reproaches
of
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excellent
,
''
murmured
Monte
Cristo
to
himself
,
as
he
came
away
.
``
All
*NL*
has
gone
according
to
my
wishes
.
The
domestic
peace
of
this
family
is
*NL*
henceforth
in
my
hands
.
Now
,
then
,
to
play
another
master-stroke
,
by
*NL*
which
I
shall
gain
the
heart
of
both
husband
and
wife
--
delightful
!
*NL*
Still
,
''
added
he
,
``
amid
all
this
,
I
have
not
yet
been
presented
to
*NL*
Mademoiselle
Eugenie
Danglars
,
whose
acquaintance
I
should
have
been
*NL*
glad
to
make
.
But
,
''
he
went
on
with
his
peculiar
smile
,
``
I
am
here
in
*NL*
Paris
,
and
have
plenty
of
time
before
me
--
by
and
by
will
do
for
that
.
''
*NL*
With
these
reflections
he
entered
his
carriage
and
returned
home
.
Two
*NL*
hours
afterwards
,
Madame
Danglars
received
a
most
flattering
epistle
*NL*
from
the
count
,
in
which
he
entreated
her
to
receive
back
her
favorite
*NL*
``
dappled
grays
,
''
protesting
that
he
could
not
endure
the
idea
of
making
*NL*
his
entry
into
the
Parisian
world
of
fashion
with
the
knowledge
that
*NL*
his
splendid
equipage
had
been
obtained
at
the
price
of
a
lovely
woman
's
*NL*
regrets
.
The
horses
were
sent
back
wearing
the
same
harness
she
had
seen
*NL*
on
them
in
the
morning
;
only
,
by
the
count
's
orders
,
in
the
centre
of
*NL*
each
rosette
that
adorned
either
side
of
their
heads
,
had
been
fastened
*NL*
a
large
diamond
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
Danglars
Monte
Cristo
also
wrote
,
requesting
him
to
excuse
the
*NL*
whimsical
gift
of
a
capricious
millionaire
,
and
to
beg
the
baroness
to
*NL*
pardon
the
Eastern
fashion
adopted
in
the
return
of
the
horses
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
evening
,
Monte
Cristo
quitted
Paris
for
Auteuil
,
accompanied
*NL*
by
Ali
.
The
following
day
,
about
three
o'clock
,
a
single
blow
struck
on
*NL*
the
gong
summoned
Ali
to
the
presence
of
the
count
.
``
Ali
,
''
observed
*NL*
his
master
,
as
the
Nubian
entered
the
chamber
,
``
you
have
frequently
*NL*
explained
to
me
how
more
than
commonly
skilful
you
are
in
throwing
the
*NL*
lasso
,
have
you
not
?
''
Ali
drew
himself
up
proudly
,
and
then
returned
a
*NL*
sign
in
the
affirmative
.
``
I
thought
I
did
not
mistake
.
With
your
lasso
*NL*
you
could
stop
an
ox
?
''
Again
Ali
repeated
his
affirmative
gesture
.
``
Or
a
*NL*
tiger
?
''
Ali
bowed
his
head
in
token
of
assent
.
``
A
lion
even
?
''
Ali
sprung
*NL*
forwards
,
imitating
the
action
of
one
throwing
the
lasso
,
then
of
a
*NL*
strangled
lion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
understand
,
''
said
Monte
Cristo
;
``
you
wish
to
tell
me
you
have
hunted
*NL*
the
lion
?
''
Ali
smiled
with
triumphant
pride
as
he
signified
that
he
*NL*
had
indeed
both
chased
and
captured
many
lions
.
``
But
do
you
believe
*NL*
you
could
arrest
the
progress
of
two
horses
rushing
forwards
with
*NL*
ungovernable
fury
?
''
The
Nubian
smiled
.
``
It
is
well
,
''
said
Monte
Cristo
.
*NL*
``
Then
listen
to
me
.
Ere
long
a
carriage
will
dash
past
here
,
drawn
by
*NL*
the
pair
of
dappled
gray
horses
you
saw
me
with
yesterday
;
now
,
at
the
*NL*
risk
of
your
own
life
,
you
must
manage
to
stop
those
horses
before
my
*NL*
door
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ali
descended
to
the
street
,
and
marked
a
straight
line
on
the
pavement
*NL*
immediately
at
the
entrance
of
the
house
,
and
then
pointed
out
the
line
*NL*
he
had
traced
to
the
count
,
who
was
watching
him
.
The
count
patted
him
*NL*
gently
on
the
shoulder
,
his
usual
mode
of
praising
Ali
,
who
,
pleased
*NL*
and
gratified
with
the
commission
assigned
him
,
walked
calmly
towards
a
*NL*
projecting
stone
forming
the
angle
of
the
street
and
house
,
and
,
seating
*NL*
himself
thereon
,
began
to
smoke
his
chibouque
,
while
Monte
Cristo
*NL*
re-entered
his
dwelling
,
perfectly
assured
of
the
success
of
his
plan
.
*NL*
Still
,
as
five
o'clock
approached
,
and
the
carriage
was
momentarily
*NL*
expected
by
the
count
,
the
indication
of
more
than
common
impatience
and
*NL*
uneasiness
might
be
observed
in
his
manner
.
He
stationed
himself
in
a
*NL*
room
commanding
a
view
of
the
street
,
pacing
the
chamber
with
restless
*NL*
steps
,
stopping
merely
to
listen
from
time
to
time
for
the
sound
of
*NL*
approaching
wheels
,
then
to
cast
an
anxious
glance
on
Ali
;
but
the
*NL*
regularity
with
which
the
Nubian
puffed
forth
the
smoke
of
his
chibouque
*NL*
proved
that
he
at
least
was
wholly
absorbed
in
the
enjoyment
of
his
*NL*
favorite
occupation
.
Suddenly
a
distant
sound
of
rapidly
advancing
*NL*
wheels
was
heard
,
and
almost
immediately
a
carriage
appeared
,
drawn
by
*NL*
a
pair
of
wild
,
ungovernable
horses
,
while
the
terrified
coachman
strove
*NL*
in
vain
to
restrain
their
furious
speed
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
vehicle
was
a
young
woman
and
a
child
of
about
seven
or
eight
*NL*
clasped
in
each
other
's
arms
.
Terror
seemed
to
have
deprived
them
even
*NL*
of
the
power
of
uttering
a
cry
.
The
carriage
creaked
and
rattled
as
it
*NL*
flew
over
the
rough
stones
,
and
the
slightest
obstacle
under
the
wheels
*NL*
would
have
caused
disaster
;
but
it
kept
on
in
the
middle
of
the
road
,
*NL*
and
those
who
saw
it
pass
uttered
cries
of
terror
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ali
suddenly
cast
aside
his
chibouque
,
drew
the
lasso
from
his
pocket
,
*NL*
threw
it
so
skilfully
as
to
catch
the
forelegs
of
the
near
horse
in
its
*NL*
triple
fold
,
and
suffered
himself
to
be
dragged
on
for
a
few
steps
by
*NL*
the
violence
of
the
shock
,
then
the
animal
fell
over
on
the
pole
,
which
*NL*
snapped
,
and
therefore
prevented
the
other
horse
from
pursuing
its
way
.
*NL*
Gladly
availing
himself
of
this
opportunity
,
the
coachman
leaped
from
*NL*
his
box
;
but
Ali
had
promptly
seized
the
nostrils
of
the
second
horse
,
*NL*
and
held
them
in
his
iron
grasp
,
till
the
beast
,
snorting
with
pain
,
*NL*
sunk
beside
his
companion
.
All
this
was
achieved
in
much
less
time
*NL*
than
is
occupied
in
the
recital
.
The
brief
space
had
,
however
,
been
*NL*
sufficient
for
a
man
,
followed
by
a
number
of
servants
,
to
rush
from
*NL*
the
house
before
which
the
accident
had
occurred
,
and
,
as
the
coachman
*NL*
opened
the
door
of
the
carriage
,
to
take
from
it
a
lady
who
was
*NL*
convulsively
grasping
the
cushions
with
one
hand
,
while
with
the
other
*NL*
she
pressed
to
her
bosom
the
young
boy
,
who
had
lost
consciousness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Monte
Cristo
carried
them
both
to
the
salon
,
and
deposited
them
on
a
*NL*
sofa
.
``
Compose
yourself
,
madame
,
''
said
he
;
``
all
danger
is
over
.
''
The
*NL*
woman
looked
up
at
these
words
,
and
,
with
a
glance
far
more
expressive
*NL*
than
any
entreaties
could
have
been
,
pointed
to
her
child
,
who
still
*NL*
continued
insensible
.
``
I
understand
the
nature
of
your
alarms
,
madame
,
''
*NL*
said
the
count
,
carefully
examining
the
child
,
``
but
I
assure
you
there
*NL*
is
not
the
slightest
occasion
for
uneasiness
;
your
little
charge
has
not
*NL*
received
the
least
injury
;
his
insensibility
is
merely
the
effects
of
*NL*
terror
,
and
will
soon
pass
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
quite
sure
you
do
not
say
so
to
tranquillize
my
fears
?
See
*NL*
how
deadly
pale
he
is
!
My
child
,
my
darling
Edward
;
speak
to
your
*NL*
mother
--
open
your
dear
eyes
and
look
on
me
once
again
!
Oh
,
sir
,
in
pity
*NL*
send
for
a
physician
;
my
whole
fortune
shall
not
be
thought
too
much
for
*NL*
the
recovery
of
my
boy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
a
calm
smile
and
a
gentle
wave
of
the
hand
,
Monte
Cristo
signed
to
*NL*
the
distracted
mother
to
lay
aside
her
apprehensions
;
then
,
opening
*NL*
a
casket
that
stood
near
,
he
drew
forth
a
phial
of
Bohemian
glass
*NL*
incrusted
with
gold
,
containing
a
liquid
of
the
color
of
blood
,
of
which
*NL*
he
let
fall
a
single
drop
on
the
child
's
lips
.
Scarcely
had
it
reached
*NL*
them
,
ere
the
boy
,
though
still
pale
as
marble
,
opened
his
eyes
,
and
*NL*
eagerly
gazed
around
him
.
At
this
,
the
delight
of
the
mother
was
almost
*NL*
frantic
.
``
Where
am
I
?
''
exclaimed
she
;
``
and
to
whom
am
I
indebted
for
so
*NL*
happy
a
termination
to
my
late
dreadful
alarm
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madame
,
''
answered
the
count
,
``
you
are
under
the
roof
of
one
who
esteems
*NL*
himself
most
fortunate
in
having
been
able
to
save
you
from
a
further
*NL*
continuance
of
your
sufferings
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
wretched
curiosity
has
brought
all
this
about
,
''
pursued
the
lady
.
*NL*
``
All
Paris
rung
with
the
praises
of
Madame
Danglars
'
beautiful
horses
,
*NL*
and
I
had
the
folly
to
desire
to
know
whether
they
really
merited
the
*NL*
high
praise
given
to
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
possible
,
''
exclaimed
the
count
with
well-feigned
astonishment
,
*NL*
``
that
these
horses
belong
to
the
baroness
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
do
,
indeed
.
May
I
inquire
if
you
are
acquainted
with
Madame
*NL*
Danglars
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
that
honor
;
and
my
happiness
at
your
escape
from
the
danger
that
*NL*
threatened
you
is
redoubled
by
the
consciousness
that
I
have
been
*NL*
the
unwilling
and
the
unintentional
cause
of
all
the
peril
you
have
*NL*
incurred
.
I
yesterday
purchased
these
horses
of
the
baron
;
but
as
the
*NL*
baroness
evidently
regretted
parting
with
them
,
I
ventured
to
send
them
*NL*
back
to
her
,
with
a
request
that
she
would
gratify
me
by
accepting
them
*NL*
from
my
hands
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
,
then
,
doubtless
,
the
Count
of
Monte
Cristo
,
of
whom
Hermine
*NL*
has
talked
to
me
so
much
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
rightly
guessed
,
madame
,
''
replied
the
count
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
am
Madame
Heloise
de
Villefort
.
''
The
count
bowed
with
the
air
of
*NL*
a
person
who
hears
a
name
for
the
first
time
.
``
How
grateful
will
M.
de
*NL*
Villefort
be
for
all
your
goodness
;
how
thankfully
will
he
acknowledge
*NL*
that
to
you
alone
he
owes
the
existence
of
his
wife
and
child
!
Most
*NL*
certainly
,
but
for
the
prompt
assistance
of
your
intrepid
servant
,
this
*NL*
dear
child
and
myself
must
both
have
perished
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
I
still
shudder
at
the
fearful
danger
you
were
placed
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
trust
you
will
allow
me
to
recompense
worthily
the
devotion
of
your
*NL*
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beseech
you
,
madame
,
''
replied
Monte
Cristo
``
not
to
spoil
Ali
,
either
*NL*
by
too
great
praise
or
rewards
.
I
can
not
allow
him
to
acquire
the
habit
*NL*
of
expecting
to
be
recompensed
for
every
trifling
service
he
may
render
.
*NL*
Ali
is
my
slave
,
and
in
saving
your
life
he
was
but
discharging
his
duty
*NL*
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
''
interposed
Madame
de
Villefort
,
on
whom
the
authoritative
style
*NL*
adopted
by
the
count
made
a
deep
impression
,
``
nay
,
but
consider
that
to
*NL*
preserve
my
life
he
has
risked
his
own
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
His
life
,
madame
,
belongs
not
to
him
;
it
is
mine
,
in
return
for
my
*NL*
having
myself
saved
him
from
death
.
''
Madame
de
Villefort
made
no
further
*NL*
reply
;
her
mind
was
utterly
absorbed
in
the
contemplation
of
the
*NL*
person
who
,
from
the
first
instant
she
saw
him
,
had
made
so
powerful
*NL*
an
impression
on
her
.
During
the
evident
preoccupation
of
Madame
de
*NL*
Villefort
,
Monte
Cristo
scrutinized
the
features
and
appearance
of
*NL*
the
boy
she
kept
folded
in
her
arms
,
lavishing
on
him
the
most
tender
*NL*
endearments
.
The
child
was
small
for
his
age
,
and
unnaturally
pale
.
A
*NL*
mass
of
straight
black
hair
,
defying
all
attempts
to
train
or
curl
*NL*
it
,
fell
over
his
projecting
forehead
,
and
hung
down
to
his
shoulders
,
*NL*
giving
increased
vivacity
to
eyes
already
sparkling
with
a
youthful
love
*NL*
of
mischief
and
fondness
for
every
forbidden
enjoyment
.
His
mouth
*NL*
was
large
,
and
the
lips
,
which
had
not
yet
regained
their
color
,
*NL*
were
particularly
thin
;
in
fact
,
the
deep
and
crafty
look
,
giving
a
*NL*
predominant
expression
to
the
child
's
face
,
belonged
rather
to
a
boy
of
*NL*
twelve
or
fourteen
than
to
one
so
young
.
His
first
movement
was
to
free
*NL*
himself
by
a
violent
push
from
the
encircling
arms
of
his
mother
,
and
to
*NL*
rush
forward
to
the
casket
from
whence
the
count
had
taken
the
phial
of
*NL*
elixir
;
then
,
without
asking
permission
of
any
one
,
he
proceeded
,
in
all
*NL*
the
wilfulness
of
a
spoiled
child
unaccustomed
to
restrain
either
whims
*NL*
or
caprices
,
to
pull
the
corks
out
of
all
the
bottles
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Touch
nothing
,
my
little
friend
,
''
cried
the
count
eagerly
;
``
some
of
*NL*
those
liquids
are
not
only
dangerous
to
taste
,
but
even
to
inhale
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Villefort
became
very
pale
,
and
,
seizing
her
son
's
arm
,
drew
*NL*
him
anxiously
toward
her
;
but
,
once
satisfied
of
his
safety
,
she
also
*NL*
cast
a
brief
but
expressive
glance
on
the
casket
,
which
was
not
lost
*NL*
upon
the
count
.
At
this
moment
Ali
entered
.
At
sight
of
him
Madame
de
*NL*
Villefort
uttered
an
expression
of
pleasure
,
and
,
holding
the
child
*NL*
still
closer
towards
her
,
she
said
,
``
Edward
,
dearest
,
do
you
see
that
*NL*
good
man
?
He
has
shown
very
great
courage
and
resolution
,
for
he
exposed
*NL*
his
own
life
to
stop
the
horses
that
were
running
away
with
us
,
and
*NL*
would
certainly
have
dashed
the
carriage
to
pieces
.
Thank
him
,
then
,
*NL*
my
child
,
in
your
very
best
manner
;
for
,
had
he
not
come
to
our
aid
,
*NL*
neither
you
nor
I
would
have
been
alive
to
speak
our
thanks
.
''
The
child
*NL*
stuck
out
his
lips
and
turned
away
his
head
in
a
disdainful
manner
,
*NL*
saying
,
``
He
's
too
ugly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
count
smiled
as
if
the
child
bade
fair
to
realize
his
hopes
,
while
*NL*
Madame
de
Villefort
reprimanded
her
son
with
a
gentleness
and
moderation
*NL*
very
far
from
conveying
the
least
idea
of
a
fault
having
been
committed
.
*NL*
``
This
lady
,
''
said
the
Count
,
speaking
to
Ali
in
the
Arabic
language
,
``
is
*NL*
desirous
that
her
son
should
thank
you
for
saving
both
their
lives
;
but
*NL*
the
boy
refuses
,
saying
you
are
too
ugly
.
''
Ali
turned
his
intelligent
*NL*
countenance
towards
the
boy
,
on
whom
he
gazed
without
any
apparent
*NL*
emotion
;
but
the
spasmodic
working
of
the
nostrils
showed
to
the
*NL*
practiced
eye
of
Monte
Cristo
that
the
Arab
had
been
wounded
to
the
*NL*
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
permit
me
to
inquire
,
''
said
Madame
de
Villefort
,
as
she
arose
*NL*
to
take
her
leave
,
``
whether
you
usually
reside
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
do
not
,
''
replied
Monte
Cristo
;
``
it
is
a
small
place
I
have
*NL*
purchased
quite
lately
.
My
place
of
abode
is
No.
30
,
Avenue
des
Champs
*NL*
Elysees
;
but
I
see
you
have
quite
recovered
from
your
fright
,
and
are
,
*NL*
no
doubt
,
desirous
of
returning
home
.
Anticipating
your
wishes
,
I
have
*NL*
desired
the
same
horses
you
came
with
to
be
put
to
one
of
my
carriages
,
*NL*
and
Ali
,
he
whom
you
think
so
very
ugly
,
''
continued
he
,
addressing
the
*NL*
boy
with
a
smiling
air
,
``
will
have
the
honor
of
driving
you
home
,
while
*NL*
your
coachman
remains
here
to
attend
to
the
necessary
repairs
of
your
*NL*
calash
.
As
soon
as
that
important
business
is
concluded
,
I
will
have
a
*NL*
pair
of
my
own
horses
harnessed
to
convey
it
direct
to
Madame
Danglars
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
dare
not
return
with
those
dreadful
horses
,
''
said
Madame
de
*NL*
Villefort
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
see
,
''
replied
Monte
Cristo
,
``
that
they
will
be
as
different
as
*NL*
possible
in
the
hands
of
Ali
.
With
him
they
will
be
gentle
and
docile
*NL*
as
lambs
.
''
Ali
had
,
indeed
,
given
proof
of
this
;
for
,
approaching
the
*NL*
animals
,
who
had
been
got
upon
their
legs
with
considerable
difficulty
,
*NL*
he
rubbed
their
foreheads
and
nostrils
with
a
sponge
soaked
in
aromatic
*NL*
vinegar
,
and
wiped
off
the
sweat
and
foam
that
covered
their
mouths
.
*NL*
Then
,
commencing
a
loud
whistling
noise
,
he
rubbed
them
well
all
over
*NL*
their
bodies
for
several
minutes
;
then
,
undisturbed
by
the
noisy
crowd
*NL*
collected
round
the
broken
carriage
,
Ali
quietly
harnessed
the
pacified
*NL*
animals
to
the
count
's
chariot
,
took
the
reins
in
his
hands
,
and
mounted
*NL*
the
box
,
when
to
the
utter
astonishment
of
those
who
had
witnessed
*NL*
the
ungovernable
spirit
and
maddened
speed
of
the
same
horses
,
he
was
*NL*
actually
compelled
to
apply
his
whip
in
no
very
gentle
manner
before
*NL*
he
could
induce
them
to
start
;
and
even
then
all
that
could
be
obtained
*NL*
from
the
celebrated
``
dappled
grays
,
''
now
changed
into
a
couple
of
dull
,
*NL*
sluggish
,
stupid
brutes
,
was
a
slow
,
pottering
pace
,
kept
up
with
*NL*
so
much
difficulty
that
Madame
de
Villefort
was
more
than
two
hours
*NL*
returning
to
her
residence
in
the
Faubourg
St.
Honore
.
*NL*
*NL*
Scarcely
had
the
first
congratulations
upon
her
marvellous
escape
been
*NL*
gone
through
when
she
wrote
the
following
letter
to
Madame
Danglars
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
Dear
Hermine
,
--
I
have
just
had
a
wonderful
escape
from
the
most
imminent
*NL*
danger
,
and
I
owe
my
safety
to
the
very
Count
of
Monte
Cristo
we
were
*NL*
talking
about
yesterday
,
but
whom
I
little
expected
to
see
to-day
.
I
*NL*
remember
how
unmercifully
I
laughed
at
what
I
considered
your
eulogistic
*NL*
and
exaggerated
praises
of
him
;
but
I
have
now
ample
cause
to
admit
that
*NL*
your
enthusiastic
description
of
this
wonderful
man
fell
far
short
of
*NL*
his
merits
.
Your
horses
got
as
far
as
Ranelagh
,
when
they
darted
forward
*NL*
like
mad
things
,
and
galloped
away
at
so
fearful
a
rate
,
that
there
*NL*
seemed
no
other
prospect
for
myself
and
my
poor
Edward
but
that
of
being
*NL*
dashed
to
pieces
against
the
first
object
that
impeded
their
progress
,
*NL*
when
a
strange-looking
man
,
--
an
Arab
,
a
negro
,
or
a
Nubian
,
at
least
*NL*
a
black
of
some
nation
or
other
--
at
a
signal
from
the
count
,
whose
*NL*
domestic
he
is
,
suddenly
seized
and
stopped
the
infuriated
animals
,
even
*NL*
at
the
risk
of
being
trampled
to
death
himself
;
and
certainly
he
must
*NL*
have
had
a
most
wonderful
escape
.
The
count
then
hastened
to
us
,
and
*NL*
took
us
into
his
house
,
where
he
speedily
recalled
my
poor
Edward
to
*NL*
life
.
He
sent
us
home
in
his
own
carriage
.
Yours
will
be
returned
to
you
*NL*
to-morrow
.
You
will
find
your
horses
in
bad
condition
,
from
the
results
*NL*
of
this
accident
;
they
seem
thoroughly
stupefied
,
as
if
sulky
and
vexed
*NL*
at
having
been
conquered
by
man
.
The
count
,
however
,
has
commissioned
*NL*
me
to
assure
you
that
two
or
three
days
'
rest
,
with
plenty
of
barley
for
*NL*
their
sole
food
during
that
time
,
will
bring
them
back
to
as
fine
,
that
*NL*
is
as
terrifying
,
a
condition
as
they
were
in
yesterday
.
Adieu
!
I
can
not
*NL*
return
you
many
thanks
for
the
drive
of
yesterday
;
but
,
after
all
,
*NL*
I
ought
not
to
blame
you
for
the
misconduct
of
your
horses
,
more
*NL*
especially
as
it
procured
me
the
pleasure
of
an
introduction
to
the
*NL*
Count
of
Monte
Cristo
,
--
and
certainly
that
illustrious
personage
,
apart
*NL*
from
the
millions
he
is
said
to
be
so
very
anxious
to
dispose
of
,
seemed
*NL*
to
me
one
of
those
curiously
interesting
problems
I
,
for
one
,
delight
in
*NL*
solving
at
any
risk
,
even
if
it
were
to
necessitate
another
drive
to
*NL*
the
Bois
behind
your
horses
.
Edward
endured
the
accident
with
miraculous
*NL*
courage
--
he
did
not
utter
a
single
cry
,
but
fell
lifeless
into
my
arms
;
*NL*
nor
did
a
tear
fall
from
his
eyes
after
it
was
over
.
I
doubt
not
you
*NL*
will
consider
these
praises
the
result
of
blind
maternal
affection
,
but
*NL*
there
is
a
soul
of
iron
in
that
delicate
,
fragile
body
.
Valentine
sends
*NL*
many
affectionate
remembrances
to
your
dear
Eugenie
.
I
embrace
you
with
*NL*
all
my
heart
.

*NL*
P.S.
--
Do
pray
contrive
some
means
for
me
to
meet
the
Count
of
Monte
*NL*
Cristo
at
your
house
.
I
must
and
will
see
him
again
.
I
have
just
made
*NL*
M.
de
Villefort
promise
to
call
on
him
,
and
I
hope
the
visit
will
be
*NL*
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
night
the
adventure
at
Auteuil
was
talked
of
everywhere
.
Albert
*NL*
related
it
to
his
mother
;
Chateau-Renaud
recounted
it
at
the
Jockey
*NL*
Club
,
and
Debray
detailed
it
at
length
in
the
salons
of
the
minister
;
*NL*
even
Beauchamp
accorded
twenty
lines
in
his
journal
to
the
relation
*NL*
of
the
count
's
courage
and
gallantry
,
thereby
celebrating
him
as
the
*NL*
greatest
hero
of
the
day
in
the
eyes
of
all
the
feminine
members
of
the
*NL*
aristocracy
.
Vast
was
the
crowd
of
visitors
and
inquiring
friends
who
*NL*
left
their
names
at
the
residence
of
Madame
de
Villefort
,
with
the
*NL*
design
of
renewing
their
visit
at
the
right
moment
,
of
hearing
from
her
*NL*
lips
all
the
interesting
circumstances
of
this
most
romantic
adventure
.
*NL*
As
for
M.
de
Villefort
,
he
fulfilled
the
predictions
of
Heloise
to
the
*NL*
letter
,
--
donned
his
dress
suit
,
drew
on
a
pair
of
white
gloves
,
ordered
*NL*
the
servants
to
attend
the
carriage
dressed
in
their
full
livery
,
and
*NL*
drove
that
same
night
to
No.
30
in
the
Avenue
des
Champs-Elysees
.

Ideology
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
the
Count
of
Monte
Cristo
had
been
for
a
long
time
familiar
with
*NL*
the
ways
of
Parisian
society
,
he
would
have
appreciated
better
the
*NL*
significance
of
the
step
which
M.
de
Villefort
had
taken
.
Standing
well
*NL*
at
court
,
whether
the
king
regnant
was
of
the
older
or
younger
branch
,
*NL*
whether
the
government
was
doctrinaire
liberal
,
or
conservative
;
looked
*NL*
upon
by
all
as
a
man
of
talent
,
since
those
who
have
never
experienced
*NL*
a
political
check
are
generally
so
regarded
;
hated
by
many
,
but
warmly
*NL*
supported
by
others
,
without
being
really
liked
by
anybody
,
M.
de
*NL*
Villefort
held
a
high
position
in
the
magistracy
,
and
maintained
*NL*
his
eminence
like
a
Harlay
or
a
Mole
.
His
drawing-room
,
under
the
*NL*
regenerating
influence
of
a
young
wife
and
a
daughter
by
his
first
*NL*
marriage
,
scarcely
eighteen
,
was
still
one
of
the
well-regulated
Paris
*NL*
salons
where
the
worship
of
traditional
customs
and
the
observance
of
*NL*
rigid
etiquette
were
carefully
maintained
.
A
freezing
politeness
,
*NL*
a
strict
fidelity
to
government
principles
,
a
profound
contempt
for
*NL*
theories
and
theorists
,
a
deep-seated
hatred
of
ideality
,
--
these
were
*NL*
the
elements
of
private
and
public
life
displayed
by
M.
de
Villefort
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
not
only
a
magistrate
,
he
was
almost
a
diplomatist
.
His
relations
*NL*
with
the
former
court
,
of
which
he
always
spoke
with
dignity
and
*NL*
respect
,
made
him
respected
by
the
new
one
,
and
he
knew
so
many
*NL*
things
,
that
not
only
was
he
always
carefully
considered
,
but
sometimes
*NL*
consulted
.
Perhaps
this
would
not
have
been
so
had
it
been
possible
to
*NL*
get
rid
of
M.
de
Villefort
;
but
,
like
the
feudal
barons
who
rebelled
*NL*
against
their
sovereign
,
he
dwelt
in
an
impregnable
fortress
.
This
*NL*
fortress
was
his
post
as
king
's
attorney
,
all
the
advantages
of
which
*NL*
he
exploited
with
marvellous
skill
,
and
which
he
would
not
have
resigned
*NL*
but
to
be
made
deputy
,
and
thus
to
replace
neutrality
by
opposition
.
*NL*
Ordinarily
M.
de
Villefort
made
and
returned
very
few
visits
.
His
wife
*NL*
visited
for
him
,
and
this
was
the
received
thing
in
the
world
,
where
the
*NL*
weighty
and
multifarious
occupations
of
the
magistrate
were
accepted
as
*NL*
an
excuse
for
what
was
really
only
calculated
pride
,
a
manifestation
of
*NL*
professed
superiority
--
in
fact
,
the
application
of
the
axiom
,
``
Pretend
*NL*
to
think
well
of
yourself
,
and
the
world
will
think
well
of
you
,
''
an
*NL*
axiom
a
hundred
times
more
useful
in
society
nowadays
than
that
of
the
*NL*
Greeks
,
``
Know
thyself
,
''
a
knowledge
for
which
,
in
our
days
,
we
have
*NL*
substituted
the
less
difficult
and
more
advantageous
science
of
knowing
*NL*
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
his
friends
M.
de
Villefort
was
a
powerful
protector
;
to
his
enemies
,
*NL*
he
was
a
silent
,
but
bitter
opponent
;
for
those
who
were
neither
the
*NL*
one
nor
the
other
,
he
was
a
statue
of
the
law-made
man
.
He
had
a
haughty
*NL*
bearing
,
a
look
either
steady
and
impenetrable
or
insolently
piercing
*NL*
and
inquisitorial
.
Four
successive
revolutions
had
built
and
cemented
*NL*
the
pedestal
upon
which
his
fortune
was
based
.
M.
de
Villefort
had
the
*NL*
reputation
of
being
the
least
curious
and
the
least
wearisome
man
in
*NL*
France
.
He
gave
a
ball
every
year
,
at
which
he
appeared
for
a
quarter
of
*NL*
an
hour
only
,
--
that
is
to
say
,
five
and
forty
minutes
less
than
the
king
*NL*
is
visible
at
his
balls
.
He
was
never
seen
at
the
theatres
,
at
concerts
,
*NL*
or
in
any
place
of
public
resort
.
Occasionally
,
but
seldom
,
he
played
*NL*
at
whist
,
and
then
care
was
taken
to
select
partners
worthy
of
*NL*
him
--
sometimes
they
were
ambassadors
,
sometimes
archbishops
,
or
*NL*
sometimes
a
prince
,
or
a
president
,
or
some
dowager
duchess
.
Such
was
*NL*
the
man
whose
carriage
had
just
now
stopped
before
the
Count
of
Monte
*NL*
Cristo
's
door
.
The
valet
de
chambre
announced
M.
de
Villefort
at
the
*NL*
moment
when
the
count
,
leaning
over
a
large
table
,
was
tracing
on
a
map
*NL*
the
route
from
St.
Petersburg
to
China
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
procureur
entered
with
the
same
grave
and
measured
step
he
would
*NL*
have
employed
in
entering
a
court
of
justice
.
He
was
the
same
man
,
or
*NL*
rather
the
development
of
the
same
man
,
whom
we
have
heretofore
seen
as
*NL*
assistant
attorney
at
Marseilles
.
Nature
,
according
to
her
way
,
had
*NL*
made
no
deviation
in
the
path
he
had
marked
out
for
himself
.
From
being
*NL*
slender
he
had
now
become
meagre
;
once
pale
,
he
was
now
yellow
;
his
*NL*
deep-set
eyes
were
hollow
,
and
the
gold
spectacles
shielding
his
eyes
*NL*
seemed
to
be
an
integral
portion
of
his
face
.
He
dressed
entirely
in
*NL*
black
,
with
the
exception
of
his
white
tie
,
and
his
funeral
appearance
*NL*
was
only
mitigated
by
the
slight
line
of
red
ribbon
which
passed
almost
*NL*
imperceptibly
through
his
button-hole
,
and
appeared
like
a
streak
of
*NL*
blood
traced
with
a
delicate
brush
.
Although
master
of
himself
,
Monte
*NL*
Cristo
,
scrutinized
with
irrepressible
curiosity
the
magistrate
whose
*NL*
salute
he
returned
,
and
who
,
distrustful
by
habit
,
and
especially
*NL*
incredulous
as
to
social
prodigies
,
was
much
more
despised
to
look
*NL*
upon
``
the
noble
stranger
,
''
as
Monte
Cristo
was
already
called
,
as
an
*NL*
adventurer
in
search
of
new
fields
,
or
an
escaped
criminal
,
rather
than
*NL*
as
a
prince
of
the
Holy
See
,
or
a
sultan
of
the
Thousand
and
One
Nights
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
,
''
said
Villefort
,
in
the
squeaky
tone
assumed
by
magistrates
in
*NL*
their
oratorical
periods
,
and
of
which
they
can
not
,
or
will
not
,
divest
*NL*
themselves
in
society
,
``
sir
,
the
signal
service
which
you
yesterday
*NL*
rendered
to
my
wife
and
son
has
made
it
a
duty
for
me
to
offer
you
my
*NL*
thanks
.
I
have
come
,
therefore
,
to
discharge
this
duty
,
and
to
express
*NL*
to
you
my
overwhelming
gratitude
.
''
And
as
he
said
this
,
the
``
eye
severe
''
*NL*
of
the
magistrate
had
lost
nothing
of
its
habitual
arrogance
.
He
spoke
*NL*
in
a
voice
of
the
procureur-general
,
with
the
rigid
inflexibility
of
*NL*
neck
and
shoulders
which
caused
his
flatterers
to
say
-LRB-
as
we
have
before
*NL*
observed
-RRB-
that
he
was
the
living
statue
of
the
law
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
,
''
replied
the
count
,
with
a
chilling
air
,
``
I
am
very
happy
to
*NL*
have
been
the
means
of
preserving
a
son
to
his
mother
,
for
they
say
that
*NL*
the
sentiment
of
maternity
is
the
most
holy
of
all
;
and
the
good
fortune
*NL*
which
occurred
to
me
,
monsieur
,
might
have
enabled
you
to
dispense
with
*NL*
a
duty
which
,
in
its
discharge
,
confers
an
undoubtedly
great
honor
;
for
*NL*
I
am
aware
that
M.
de
Villefort
is
not
usually
lavish
of
the
favor
which
*NL*
he
now
bestows
on
me
,
--
a
favor
which
,
however
estimable
,
is
unequal
*NL*
to
the
satisfaction
which
I
have
in
my
own
consciousness
.
''
Villefort
,
*NL*
astonished
at
this
reply
,
which
he
by
no
means
expected
,
started
like
a
*NL*
soldier
who
feels
the
blow
levelled
at
him
over
the
armor
he
wears
,
and
*NL*
a
curl
of
his
disdainful
lip
indicated
that
from
that
moment
he
noted
in
*NL*
the
tablets
of
his
brain
that
the
Count
of
Monte
Cristo
was
by
no
*NL*
means
a
highly
bred
gentleman
.
He
glanced
around
,
in
order
to
seize
*NL*
on
something
on
which
the
conversation
might
turn
,
and
seemed
to
fall
*NL*
easily
on
a
topic
.
He
saw
the
map
which
Monte
Cristo
had
been
examining
*NL*
when
he
entered
,
and
said
,
``
You
seem
geographically
engaged
,
sir
?
It
is
*NL*
a
rich
study
for
you
,
who
,
as
I
learn
,
have
seen
as
many
lands
as
are
*NL*
delineated
on
this
map
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
,
''
replied
the
count
;
``
I
have
sought
to
make
of
the
human
*NL*
race
,
taken
in
the
mass
,
what
you
practice
every
day
on
individuals
--
a
*NL*
physiological
study
.
I
have
believed
it
was
much
easier
to
descend
from
*NL*
the
whole
to
a
part
than
to
ascend
from
a
part
to
the
whole
.
It
is
*NL*
an
algebraic
axiom
,
which
makes
us
proceed
from
a
known
to
an
unknown
*NL*
quantity
,
and
not
from
an
unknown
to
a
known
;
but
sit
down
,
sir
,
I
beg
*NL*
of
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Monte
Cristo
pointed
to
a
chair
,
which
the
procureur
was
obliged
to
take
*NL*
the
trouble
to
move
forwards
himself
,
while
the
count
merely
fell
back
*NL*
into
his
own
,
on
which
he
had
been
kneeling
when
M.
Villefort
entered
.
*NL*
Thus
the
count
was
halfway
turned
towards
his
visitor
,
having
his
back
*NL*
towards
the
window
,
his
elbow
resting
on
the
geographical
chart
which
*NL*
furnished
the
theme
of
conversation
for
the
moment
,
--
a
conversation
*NL*
which
assumed
,
as
in
the
case
of
the
interviews
with
Danglars
and
*NL*
Morcerf
,
a
turn
analogous
to
the
persons
,
if
not
to
the
situation
.
``
Ah
,
*NL*
you
philosophize
,
''
replied
Villefort
,
after
a
moment
's
silence
,
during
*NL*
which
,
like
a
wrestler
who
encounters
a
powerful
opponent
,
he
took
*NL*
breath
;
``
well
,
sir
,
really
,
if
,
like
you
,
I
had
nothing
else
to
do
,
I
*NL*
should
seek
a
more
amusing
occupation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
in
truth
,
sir
,
''
was
Monte
Cristo
's
reply
,
``
man
is
but
an
ugly
*NL*
caterpillar
for
him
who
studies
him
through
a
solar
microscope
;
but
you

said
,
I
think
,
that
I
had
nothing
else
to
do
.
Now
,
really
,
let
me
ask
,
*NL*
sir
,
have
you
?
--
do
you
believe
you
have
anything
to
do
?
or
to
speak
in
*NL*
plain
terms
,
do
you
really
think
that
what
you
do
deserves
being
called
*NL*
anything
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Villefort
's
astonishment
redoubled
at
this
second
thrust
so
forcibly
*NL*
made
by
his
strange
adversary
.
It
was
a
long
time
since
the
magistrate
*NL*
had
heard
a
paradox
so
strong
,
or
rather
,
to
say
the
truth
more
exactly
,
*NL*
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
ever
heard
of
it
.
The
procureur
exerted
*NL*
himself
to
reply
.
``
Sir
,
''
he
responded
,
``
you
are
a
stranger
,
and
I
*NL*
believe
you
say
yourself
that
a
portion
of
your
life
has
been
spent
*NL*
in
Oriental
countries
,
so
you
are
not
aware
how
human
justice
,
so
*NL*
expeditious
in
barbarous
countries
,
takes
with
us
a
prudent
and
*NL*
well-studied
course
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
--
yes
,
I
do
,
sir
;
it
is
the
pede
claudo
of
the
ancients
.
I
know
*NL*
all
that
,
for
it
is
with
the
justice
of
all
countries
especially
that
I
*NL*
have
occupied
myself
--
it
is
with
the
criminal
procedure
of
all
nations
*NL*
that
I
have
compared
natural
justice
,
and
I
must
say
,
sir
,
that
it
is
*NL*
the
law
of
primitive
nations
,
that
is
,
the
law
of
retaliation
,
that
I
*NL*
have
most
frequently
found
to
be
according
to
the
law
of
God
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
this
law
were
adopted
,
sir
,
''
said
the
procureur
,
``
it
would
greatly
*NL*
simplify
our
legal
codes
,
and
in
that
case
the
magistrates
would
not
-LRB-
as
*NL*
you
just
observed
-RRB-
have
much
to
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
may
,
perhaps
,
come
to
this
in
time
,
''
observed
Monte
Cristo
;
``
you
*NL*
know
that
human
inventions
march
from
the
complex
to
the
simple
,
and
*NL*
simplicity
is
always
perfection
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
meanwhile
,
''
continued
the
magistrate
,
``
our
codes
are
in
full
*NL*
force
,
with
all
their
contradictory
enactments
derived
from
Gallic
*NL*
customs
,
Roman
laws
,
and
Frank
usages
;
the
knowledge
of
all
which
,
*NL*
you
will
agree
,
is
not
to
be
acquired
without
extended
labor
;
it
needs
*NL*
tedious
study
to
acquire
this
knowledge
,
and
,
when
acquired
,
a
strong
*NL*
power
of
brain
to
retain
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
agree
with
you
entirely
,
sir
;
but
all
that
even
you
know
with
respect
*NL*
to
the
French
code
,
I
know
,
not
only
in
reference
to
that
code
,
but
as
*NL*
regards
the
codes
of
all
nations
.
The
English
,
Turkish
,
Japanese
,
Hindu
*NL*
laws
,
are
as
familiar
to
me
as
the
French
laws
,
and
thus
I
was
right
,
*NL*
when
I
said
to
you
,
that
relatively
-LRB-
you
know
that
everything
is
*NL*
relative
,
sir
-RRB-
--
that
relatively
to
what
I
have
done
,
you
have
very
*NL*
little
to
do
;
but
that
relatively
to
all
I
have
learned
,
you
have
yet
a
*NL*
great
deal
to
learn
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
with
what
motive
have
you
learned
all
this
?
''
inquired
Villefort
,
*NL*
in
astonishment
.
Monte
Cristo
smiled
.
``
Really
,
sir
,
''
he
observed
,
``
I
see
*NL*
that
in
spite
of
the
reputation
which
you
have
acquired
as
a
superior
*NL*
man
,
you
look
at
everything
from
the
material
and
vulgar
view
of
*NL*
society
,
beginning
with
man
,
and
ending
with
man
--
that
is
to
say
,
in
*NL*
the
most
restricted
,
most
narrow
view
which
it
is
possible
for
human
*NL*
understanding
to
embrace
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pray
,
sir
,
explain
yourself
,
''
said
Villefort
,
more
and
more
astonished
,
*NL*
``
I
really
do
--
not
--
understand
you
--
perfectly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
,
sir
,
that
with
the
eyes
fixed
on
the
social
organization
of
*NL*
nations
,
you
see
only
the
springs
of
the
machine
,
and
lose
sight
of
*NL*
the
sublime
workman
who
makes
them
act
;
I
say
that
you
do
not
recognize
*NL*
before
you
and
around
you
any
but
those
office-holders
whose
commissions
*NL*
have
been
signed
by
a
minister
or
king
;
and
that
the
men
whom
God
has
*NL*
put
above
those
office-holders
,
ministers
,
and
kings
,
by
giving
them
a
*NL*
mission
to
follow
out
,
instead
of
a
post
to
fill
--
I
say
that
they
*NL*
escape
your
narrow
,
limited
field
of
observation
.
It
is
thus
that
human
*NL*
weakness
fails
,
from
its
debilitated
and
imperfect
organs
.
Tobias
took
*NL*
the
angel
who
restored
him
to
light
for
an
ordinary
young
man
.
The
*NL*
nations
took
Attila
,
who
was
doomed
to
destroy
them
,
for
a
conqueror
*NL*
similar
to
other
conquerors
,
and
it
was
necessary
for
both
to
reveal
*NL*
their
missions
,
that
they
might
be
known
and
acknowledged
;
one
was
*NL*
compelled
to
say
,
'
I
am
the
angel
of
the
Lord
'
;
and
the
other
,
'
I
am
*NL*
the
hammer
of
God
,
'
in
order
that
the
divine
essence
in
both
might
be
*NL*
revealed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
''
said
Villefort
,
more
and
more
amazed
,
and
really
supposing
he
*NL*
was
speaking
to
a
mystic
or
a
madman
,
``
you
consider
yourself
as
one
of
*NL*
those
extraordinary
beings
whom
you
have
mentioned
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
why
not
?
''
said
Monte
Cristo
coldly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
pardon
,
sir
,
''
replied
Villefort
,
quite
astounded
,
``
but
you
will
*NL*
excuse
me
if
,
when
I
presented
myself
to
you
,
I
was
unaware
that
I
*NL*
should
meet
with
a
person
whose
knowledge
and
understanding
so
far
*NL*
surpass
the
usual
knowledge
and
understanding
of
men
.
It
is
not
usual
*NL*
with
us
corrupted
wretches
of
civilization
to
find
gentlemen
like
*NL*
yourself
,
possessors
,
as
you
are
,
of
immense
fortune
--
at
least
,
so
it
*NL*
is
said
--
and
I
beg
you
to
observe
that
I
do
not
inquire
,
I
merely
*NL*
repeat
;
--
it
is
not
usual
,
I
say
,
for
such
privileged
and
wealthy
*NL*
beings
to
waste
their
time
in
speculations
on
the
state
of
society
,
in
*NL*
philosophical
reveries
,
intended
at
best
to
console
those
whom
fate
has
*NL*
disinherited
from
the
goods
of
this
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
,
sir
,
''
retorted
the
count
,
``
have
you
attained
the
eminent
*NL*
situation
in
which
you
are
,
without
having
admitted
,
or
even
without
*NL*
having
met
with
exceptions
?
and
do
you
never
use
your
eyes
,
which
must
*NL*
have
acquired
so
much
finesse
and
certainty
,
to
divine
,
at
a
glance
,
the
*NL*
kind
of
man
by
whom
you
are
confronted
?
Should
not
a
magistrate
be
not
*NL*
merely
the
best
administrator
of
the
law
,
but
the
most
crafty
expounder
*NL*
of
the
chicanery
of
his
profession
,
a
steel
probe
to
search
hearts
,
a
*NL*
touchstone
to
try
the
gold
which
in
each
soul
is
mingled
with
more
or
*NL*
less
of
alloy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
,
''
said
Villefort
,
``
upon
my
word
,
you
overcome
me
.
I
really
never
*NL*
heard
a
person
speak
as
you
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
you
remain
eternally
encircled
in
a
round
of
general
*NL*
conditions
,
and
have
never
dared
to
raise
your
wings
into
those
upper
*NL*
spheres
which
God
has
peopled
with
invisible
or
exceptional
beings
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
allow
then
,
sir
,
that
spheres
exist
,
and
that
these
marked
and
*NL*
invisible
beings
mingle
amongst
us
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
should
they
not
?
Can
you
see
the
air
you
breathe
,
and
yet
without
*NL*
which
you
could
not
for
a
moment
exist
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
we
do
not
see
those
beings
to
whom
you
allude
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
we
do
;
you
see
them
whenever
God
pleases
to
allow
them
to
assume
a
*NL*
material
form
.
You
touch
them
,
come
in
contact
with
them
,
speak
to
them
,
*NL*
and
they
reply
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
said
Villefort
,
smiling
,
``
I
confess
I
should
like
to
be
warned
*NL*
when
one
of
these
beings
is
in
contact
with
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
been
served
as
you
desire
,
monsieur
,
for
you
were
warned
just
*NL*
now
,
and
I
now
again
warn
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
yourself
are
one
of
these
marked
beings
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
monsieur
,
I
believe
so
;
for
until
now
,
no
man
has
found
himself
in
*NL*
a
position
similar
to
mine
.
The
dominions
of
kings
are
limited
either
*NL*
by
mountains
or
rivers
,
or
a
change
of
manners
,
or
an
alteration
of
*NL*
language
.
My
kingdom
is
bounded
only
by
the
world
,
for
I
am
not
an
*NL*
Italian
,
or
a
Frenchman
,
or
a
Hindu
,
or
an
American
,
or
a
Spaniard
--
I
am
*NL*
a
cosmopolite
.
No
country
can
say
it
saw
my
birth
.
God
alone
knows
what
*NL*
country
will
see
me
die
.
I
adopt
all
customs
,
speak
all
languages
.
You
*NL*
believe
me
to
be
a
Frenchman
,
for
I
speak
French
with
the
same
facility
*NL*
and
purity
as
yourself
.
Well
,
Ali
,
my
Nubian
,
believes
me
to
be
an
Arab
;
*NL*
Bertuccio
,
my
steward
,
takes
me
for
a
Roman
;
Haidee
,
my
slave
,
thinks
*NL*
me
a
Greek
.
You
may
,
therefore
,
comprehend
,
that
being
of
no
country
,
*NL*
asking
no
protection
from
any
government
,
acknowledging
no
man
as
*NL*
my
brother
,
not
one
of
the
scruples
that
arrest
the
powerful
,
or
the
*NL*
obstacles
which
paralyze
the
weak
,
paralyzes
or
arrests
me
.
I
have
only
*NL*
two
adversaries
--
I
will
not
say
two
conquerors
,
for
with
perseverance
I
*NL*
subdue
even
them
,
--
they
are
time
and
distance
.
There
is
a
third
,
and
the
*NL*
most
terrible
--
that
is
my
condition
as
a
mortal
being
.
This
alone
can
*NL*
stop
me
in
my
onward
career
,
before
I
have
attained
the
goal
at
which
*NL*
I
aim
,
for
all
the
rest
I
have
reduced
to
mathematical
terms
.
What
men
*NL*
call
the
chances
of
fate
--
namely
,
ruin
,
change
,
circumstances
--
I
have
*NL*
fully
anticipated
,
and
if
any
of
these
should
overtake
me
,
yet
it
*NL*
will
not
overwhelm
me
.
Unless
I
die
,
I
shall
always
be
what
I
am
,
and
*NL*
therefore
it
is
that
I
utter
the
things
you
have
never
heard
,
even
from
*NL*
the
mouths
of
kings
--
for
kings
have
need
,
and
other
persons
have
fear
*NL*
of
you
.
For
who
is
there
who
does
not
say
to
himself
,
in
a
society
as
*NL*
incongruously
organized
as
ours
,
`
Perhaps
some
day
I
shall
have
to
do
*NL*
with
the
king
's
attorney
'
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
can
you
not
say
that
,
sir
?
The
moment
you
become
an
inhabitant
of
*NL*
France
,
you
are
naturally
subjected
to
the
French
law
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
it
sir
,
''
replied
Monte
Cristo
;
``
but
when
I
visit
a
country
I
*NL*
begin
to
study
,
by
all
the
means
which
are
available
,
the
men
from
whom
*NL*
I
may
have
anything
to
hope
or
to
fear
,
till
I
know
them
as
well
as
,
*NL*
perhaps
better
than
,
they
know
themselves
.
It
follows
from
this
,
that
*NL*
the
king
's
attorney
,
be
he
who
he
may
,
with
whom
I
should
have
to
deal
,
*NL*
would
assuredly
be
more
embarrassed
than
I
should
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
to
say
,
''
replied
Villefort
with
hesitation
,
``
that
human
nature
*NL*
being
weak
,
every
man
,
according
to
your
creed
,
has
committed
faults
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Faults
or
crimes
,
''
responded
Monte
Cristo
with
a
negligent
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
that
you
alone
,
amongst
the
men
whom
you
do
not
recognize
as
your
*NL*
brothers
--
for
you
have
said
so
,
''
observed
Villefort
in
a
tone
that
*NL*
faltered
somewhat
--
``
you
alone
are
perfect
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
not
perfect
,
''
was
the
count
's
reply
;
``
only
impenetrable
,
that
's
*NL*
all
.
But
let
us
leave
off
this
strain
,
sir
,
if
the
tone
of
it
is
*NL*
displeasing
to
you
;
I
am
no
more
disturbed
by
your
justice
than
are
you
*NL*
by
my
second-sight
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
--
by
no
means

''
said
Villefort
,
who
was
afraid
of
seeming
*NL*
to
abandon
his
ground
.
``
No
;
by
your
brilliant
and
almost
sublime
*NL*
conversation
you
have
elevated
me
above
the
ordinary
level
;
we
no
longer
*NL*
talk
,
we
rise
to
dissertation
.
But
you
know
how
the
theologians
in
their
*NL*
collegiate
chairs
,
and
philosophers
in
their
controversies
,
occasionally
*NL*
say
cruel
truths
;
let
us
suppose
for
the
moment
that
we
are
theologizing
*NL*
in
a
social
way
,
or
even
philosophically
,
and
I
will
say
to
you
,
rude
*NL*
as
it
may
seem
,
`
My
brother
,
you
sacrifice
greatly
to
pride

you
may
be
*NL*
above
others

above
you
there
is
God

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Above
us
all

''
was
Monte
Cristo
's
response
,
in
a
tone
and
with
*NL*
an
emphasis
so
deep
that
Villefort
involuntarily
shuddered
.
``
I
have
my
*NL*
pride
for
men

serpents
always
ready
to
threaten
every
one
who
would
*NL*
pass
without
crushing
them
under
foot

But
I
lay
aside
that
pride
before

God

who
has
taken
me
from
nothing
to
make
me
what
I
am

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then

count

I
admire
you

said
Villefort
,
who
,
for
the
first
time
*NL*
in
this
strange
conversation
,
used
the
aristocratic
form
to
the
unknown
*NL*
personage
,
whom
,
until
now
,
he
had
only
called
monsieur
.
``
Yes
,
and
I
*NL*
say
to
you
,
if
you
are
really
strong
,
really
superior
,
really
pious
,
*NL*
or
impenetrable
,
which
you
were
right
in
saying
amounts
to
the
*NL*
same
thing
--
then
be
proud
,
sir
,
for
that
is
the
characteristic
of
*NL*
predominance
.
Yet
you
have
unquestionably
some
ambition
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
may
it
be
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
too
,
as
happens
to
every
man
once
in
his
life
,
have
been
taken
by
*NL*
Satan
into
the
highest
mountain
in
the
earth
,
and
when
there
he
showed
*NL*
me
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
world
,
and
as
he
said
before
,
so
said
he
to
*NL*
me
,
`
Child
of
earth
,
what
wouldst
thou
have
to
make
thee
adore
me
?
'
I
*NL*
reflected
long
,
for
a
gnawing
ambition
had
long
preyed
upon
me
,
and
then
*NL*
I
replied
,
`
Listen
,
--
I
have
always
heard
of
providence
,
and
yet
I
have
*NL*
never
seen
him
,
or
anything
that
resembles
him
,
or
which
can
make
me
*NL*
believe
that
he
exists
.
I
wish
to
be
providence
myself
,
for
I
feel
that
*NL*
the
most
beautiful
,
noblest
,
most
sublime
thing
in
the
world
,
is
*NL*
to
recompense
and
punish
.
'
Satan
bowed
his
head
,
and
groaned
.
`
You
*NL*
mistake
,
'
he
said
,
`
providence
does
exist
,
only
you
have
never
seen
him
,
*NL*
because
the
child
of
God
is
as
invisible
as
the
parent
.
You
have
seen
*NL*
nothing
that
resembles
him
,
because
he
works
by
secret
springs
,
and
*NL*
moves
by
hidden
ways
.
All
I
can
do
for
you
is
to
make
you
one
of
the
*NL*
agents
of
that
providence
.
'
The
bargain
was
concluded
.
I
may
sacrifice
*NL*
my
soul
,
but
what
matters
it
?
''
added
Monte
Cristo
.
``
If
the
thing
were
*NL*
to
do
again
,
I
would
again
do
it
.
''
Villefort
looked
at
Monte
Cristo
with
*NL*
extreme
amazement
.
``
Count
,
''
he
inquired
,
``
have
you
any
relations
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
,
I
am
alone
in
the
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
much
the
worse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
asked
Monte
Cristo
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
then
you
might
witness
a
spectacle
calculated
to
break
down
*NL*
your
pride
.
You
say
you
fear
nothing
but
death
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
not
say
that
I
feared
it
;
I
only
said
that
death
alone
could
*NL*
check
the
execution
of
my
plans
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
old
age
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
end
will
be
achieved
before
I
grow
old
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
madness
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
been
nearly
mad
;
and
you
know
the
axiom
,
--
non
bis
in
idem
.
It
*NL*
is
an
axiom
of
criminal
law
,
and
,
consequently
,
you
understand
its
full
*NL*
application
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
,
''
continued
Villefort
,
``
there
is
something
to
fear
besides
*NL*
death
,
old
age
,
and
madness
.
For
instance
,
there
is
apoplexy
--
that
*NL*
lightning-stroke
which
strikes
but
does
not
destroy
you
,
and
yet
which
*NL*
brings
everything
to
an
end
.
You
are
still
yourself
as
now
,
and
yet
you
*NL*
are
yourself
no
longer
;
you
who
,
like
Ariel
,
verge
on
the
angelic
,
are
*NL*
but
an
inert
mass
,
which
,
like
Caliban
,
verges
on
the
brutal
;
and
this
*NL*
is
called
in
human
tongues
,
as
I
tell
you
,
neither
more
nor
less
than
*NL*
apoplexy
.
Come
,
if
so
you
will
,
count
,
and
continue
this
conversation
*NL*
at
my
house
,
any
day
you
may
be
willing
to
see
an
adversary
capable
of
*NL*
understanding
and
anxious
to
refute
you
,
and
I
will
show
you
my
father
,
*NL*
M.
Noirtier
de
Villefort
,
one
of
the
most
fiery
Jacobins
of
the
French
*NL*
Revolution
;
that
is
to
say
,
he
had
the
most
remarkable
audacity
,
*NL*
seconded
by
a
most
powerful
organization
--
a
man
who
has
not
,
perhaps
,
*NL*
like
yourself
seen
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
earth
,
but
who
has
helped
to
*NL*
overturn
one
of
the
greatest
;
in
fact
,
a
man
who
believed
himself
,
*NL*
like
you
,
one
of
the
envoys
,
not
of
God
,
but
of
a
supreme
being
;
not
of
*NL*
providence
,
but
of
fate
.
Well
,
sir
,
the
rupture
of
a
blood-vessel
on
the
*NL*
lobe
of
the
brain
has
destroyed
all
this
,
not
in
a
day
,
not
in
an
hour
,
*NL*
but
in
a
second
.
M.
Noirtier
,
who
,
on
the
previous
night
,
was
the
old
*NL*
Jacobin
,
the
old
senator
,
the
old
Carbonaro
,
laughing
at
the
guillotine
,
*NL*
the
cannon
,
and
the
dagger
--
M.
Noirtier
,
playing
with
revolutions
--
M.
*NL*
Noirtier
,
for
whom
France
was
a
vast
chess-board
,
from
which
pawns
,
*NL*
rooks
,
knights
,
and
queens
were
to
disappear
,
so
that
the
king
was
*NL*
checkmated
--
M.
Noirtier
,
the
redoubtable
,
was
the
next
morning
`
poor
M.
*NL*
Noirtier
,
'
the
helpless
old
man
,
at
the
tender
mercies
of
the
weakest
*NL*
creature
in
the
household
,
that
is
,
his
grandchild
,
Valentine
;
a
dumb
*NL*
and
frozen
carcass
,
in
fact
,
living
painlessly
on
,
that
time
may
be
*NL*
given
for
his
frame
to
decompose
without
his
consciousness
of
its
*NL*
decay
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas
,
sir
,
''
said
Monte
Cristo
``
this
spectacle
is
neither
strange
to
*NL*
my
eye
nor
my
thought
.
I
am
something
of
a
physician
,
and
have
,
like
*NL*
my
fellows
,
sought
more
than
once
for
the
soul
in
living
and
in
dead
*NL*
matter
;
yet
,
like
providence
,
it
has
remained
invisible
to
my
eyes
,
*NL*
although
present
to
my
heart
.
A
hundred
writers
since
Socrates
,
Seneca
,
*NL*
St.
Augustine
,
and
Gall
,
have
made
,
in
verse
and
prose
,
the
comparison
*NL*
you
have
made
,
and
yet
I
can
well
understand
that
a
father
's
sufferings
*NL*
may
effect
great
changes
in
the
mind
of
a
son
.
I
will
call
on
you
,
*NL*
sir
,
since
you
bid
me
contemplate
,
for
the
advantage
of
my
pride
,
this
*NL*
terrible
spectacle
,
which
must
have
been
so
great
a
source
of
sorrow
to
*NL*
your
family
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
have
been
so
unquestionably
,
had
not
God
given
me
so
large
a
*NL*
compensation
.
In
contrast
with
the
old
man
,
who
is
dragging
his
way
*NL*
to
the
tomb
,
are
two
children
just
entering
into
life
--
Valentine
,
*NL*
the
daughter
by
my
first
wife
--
Mademoiselle
Renee
de
Saint-Meran
--
and
*NL*
Edward
,
the
boy
whose
life
you
have
this
day
saved
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
is
your
deduction
from
this
compensation
,
sir
?
''
inquired
Monte
*NL*
Cristo
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
deduction
is
,
''
replied
Villefort
,
``
that
my
father
,
led
away
by
his
*NL*
passions
,
has
committed
some
fault
unknown
to
human
justice
,
but
marked
*NL*
by
the
justice
of
God
.
That
God
,
desirous
in
his
mercy
to
punish
but
*NL*
one
person
,
has
visited
this
justice
on
him
alone
.
''
Monte
Cristo
with
a
*NL*
smile
on
his
lips
,
uttered
in
the
depths
of
his
soul
a
groan
which
would
*NL*
have
made
Villefort
fly
had
he
but
heard
it
.
``
Adieu
,
sir
,
''
said
the
*NL*
magistrate
,
who
had
risen
from
his
seat
;
``
I
leave
you
,
bearing
a
*NL*
remembrance
of
you
--
a
remembrance
of
esteem
,
which
I
hope
will
not
be
*NL*
disagreeable
to
you
when
you
know
me
better
;
for
I
am
not
a
man
to
bore
*NL*
my
friends
,
as
you
will
learn
.
Besides
,
you
have
made
an
eternal
friend
*NL*
of
Madame
de
Villefort
.
''
The
count
bowed
,
and
contented
himself
with
*NL*
seeing
Villefort
to
the
door
of
his
cabinet
,
the
procureur
being
*NL*
escorted
to
his
carriage
by
two
footmen
,
who
,
on
a
signal
from
their
*NL*
master
,
followed
him
with
every
mark
of
attention
.
When
he
had
gone
,
*NL*
Monte
Cristo
breathed
a
profound
sigh
,
and
said
,
--
``
Enough
of
this
*NL*
poison
,
let
me
now
seek
the
antidote
.
''
Then
sounding
his
bell
,
he
said
*NL*
to
Ali
,
who
entered
,
``
I
am
going
to
madam
's
chamber
--
have
the
carriage
*NL*
ready
at
one
o'clock

Chapter

Haidee
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
will
be
recollected
that
the
new
,
or
rather
old
,
acquaintances
of
the
*NL*
Count
of
Monte
Cristo
,
residing
in
the
Rue
Meslay
,
were
no
other
than
*NL*
Maximilian
,
Julie
,
and
Emmanuel
.
The
very
anticipations
of
delight
to
*NL*
be
enjoyed
in
his
forthcoming
visits
--
the
bright
,
pure
gleam
of
heavenly
*NL*
happiness
it
diffused
over
the
almost
deadly
warfare
in
which
he
had
*NL*
voluntarily
engaged
,
illumined
his
whole
countenance
with
a
look
of
*NL*
ineffable
joy
and
calmness
,
as
,
immediately
after
Villefort
's
departure
,
*NL*
his
thoughts
flew
back
to
the
cheering
prospect
before
him
,
of
tasting
,
*NL*
at
least
,
a
brief
respite
from
the
fierce
and
stormy
passions
of
his
*NL*
mind
.
Even
Ali
,
who
had
hastened
to
obey
the
Count
's
summons
,
went
forth
*NL*
from
his
master
's
presence
in
charmed
amazement
at
the
unusual
animation
*NL*
and
pleasure
depicted
on
features
ordinarily
so
stern
and
cold
;
while
,
*NL*
as
though
dreading
to
put
to
flight
the
agreeable
ideas
hovering
over
*NL*
his
patron
's
meditations
,
whatever
they
were
,
the
faithful
Nubian
walked
*NL*
on
tiptoe
towards
the
door
,
holding
his
breath
,
lest
its
faintest
sound
*NL*
should
dissipate
his
master
's
happy
reverie
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
noon
,
and
Monte
Cristo
had
set
apart
one
hour
to
be
passed
in
the
*NL*
apartments
of
Haidee
,
as
though
his
oppressed
spirit
could
not
all
at
*NL*
once
admit
the
feeling
of
pure
and
unmixed
joy
,
but
required
a
gradual
*NL*
succession
of
calm
and
gentle
emotions
to
prepare
his
mind
to
receive
*NL*
full
and
perfect
happiness
,
in
the
same
manner
as
ordinary
natures
*NL*
demand
to
be
inured
by
degrees
to
the
reception
of
strong
or
violent
*NL*
sensations
.
The
young
Greek
,
as
we
have
already
said
,
occupied
*NL*
apartments
wholly
unconnected
with
those
of
the
count
.
The
rooms
had
*NL*
been
fitted
up
in
strict
accordance
with
Oriental
ideas
;
the
floors
were
*NL*
covered
with
the
richest
carpets
Turkey
could
produce
;
the
walls
hung
*NL*
with
brocaded
silk
of
the
most
magnificent
designs
and
texture
;
while
*NL*
around
each
chamber
luxurious
divans
were
placed
,
with
piles
of
soft
and
*NL*
yielding
cushions
,
that
needed
only
to
be
arranged
at
the
pleasure
or
*NL*
convenience
of
such
as
sought
repose
.
Haidee
had
three
French
maids
,
*NL*
and
one
who
was
a
Greek
.
The
first
three
remained
constantly
in
a
small
*NL*
waiting-room
,
ready
to
obey
the
summons
of
a
small
golden
bell
,
or
to
*NL*
receive
the
orders
of
the
Romaic
slave
,
who
knew
just
enough
French
*NL*
to
be
able
to
transmit
her
mistress
's
wishes
to
the
three
other
*NL*
waiting-women
;
the
latter
had
received
most
peremptory
instructions
from
*NL*
Monte
Cristo
to
treat
Haidee
with
all
the
deference
they
would
observe
*NL*
to
a
queen
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
girl
herself
generally
passed
her
time
in
the
chamber
at
the
*NL*
farther
end
of
her
apartments
.
This
was
a
sort
of
boudoir
,
circular
,
*NL*
and
lighted
only
from
the
roof
,
which
consisted
of
rose-colored
glass
.
*NL*
Haidee
was
reclining
upon
soft
downy
cushions
,
covered
with
blue
satin
*NL*
spotted
with
silver
;
her
head
,
supported
by
one
of
her
exquisitely
*NL*
moulded
arms
,
rested
on
the
divan
immediately
behind
her
,
while
the
*NL*
other
was
employed
in
adjusting
to
her
lips
the
coral
tube
of
a
rich
*NL*
narghile
,
through
whose
flexible
pipe
she
drew
the
smoke
fragrant
by
its
*NL*
passage
through
perfumed
water
.
Her
attitude
,
though
perfectly
natural
*NL*
for
an
Eastern
woman
would
,
in
a
European
,
have
been
deemed
too
full
*NL*
of
coquettish
straining
after
effect
.
Her
dress
,
which
was
that
of
*NL*
the
women
of
Epirus
,
consisted
of
a
pair
of
white
satin
trousers
,
*NL*
embroidered
with
pink
roses
,
displaying
feet
so
exquisitely
formed
and
*NL*
so
delicately
fair
,
that
they
might
well
have
been
taken
for
Parian
*NL*
marble
,
had
not
the
eye
been
undeceived
by
their
movements
as
they
*NL*
constantly
shifted
in
and
out
of
a
pair
of
little
slippers
with
upturned
*NL*
toes
,
beautifully
ornamented
with
gold
and
pearls
.
She
wore
a
blue
and
*NL*
white-striped
vest
,
with
long
open
sleeves
,
trimmed
with
silver
loops
*NL*
and
buttons
of
pearls
,
and
a
sort
of
bodice
,
which
,
closing
only
from
*NL*
the
centre
to
the
waist
,
exhibited
the
whole
of
the
ivory
throat
and
*NL*
upper
part
of
the
bosom
;
it
was
fastened
with
three
magnificent
diamond
*NL*
clasps
.
The
junction
of
the
bodice
and
drawers
was
entirely
concealed
*NL*
by
one
of
the
many-colored
scarfs
,
whose
brilliant
hues
and
rich
silken
*NL*
fringe
have
rendered
them
so
precious
in
the
eyes
of
Parisian
belles
.
*NL*
Tilted
on
one
side
of
her
head
she
had
a
small
cap
of
gold-colored
silk
,
*NL*
embroidered
with
pearls
;
while
on
the
other
a
purple
rose
mingled
its
*NL*
glowing
colors
with
the
luxuriant
masses
of
her
hair
,
of
which
the
*NL*
blackness
was
so
intense
that
it
was
tinged
with
blue
.
The
extreme
*NL*
beauty
of
the
countenance
,
that
shone
forth
in
loveliness
that
mocked
*NL*
the
vain
attempts
of
dress
to
augment
it
,
was
peculiarly
and
purely
*NL*
Grecian
;
there
were
the
large
,
dark
,
melting
eyes
,
the
finely
formed
*NL*
nose
,
the
coral
lips
,
and
pearly
teeth
,
that
belonged
to
her
race
and
*NL*
country
.
And
,
to
complete
the
whole
,
Haidee
was
in
the
very
springtide
*NL*
and
fulness
of
youthful
charms
--
she
had
not
yet
numbered
more
than
*NL*
twenty
summers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Monte
Cristo
summoned
the
Greek
attendant
,
and
bade
her
inquire
whether
*NL*
it
would
be
agreeable
to
her
mistress
to
receive
his
visit
.
Haidee
's
*NL*
only
reply
was
to
direct
her
servant
by
a
sign
to
withdraw
the
*NL*
tapestried
curtain
that
hung
before
the
door
of
her
boudoir
,
the
*NL*
framework
of
the
opening
thus
made
serving
as
a
sort
of
border
to
the
*NL*
graceful
tableau
presented
by
the
young
girl
's
picturesque
attitude
and
*NL*
appearance
.
As
Monte
Cristo
approached
,
she
leaned
upon
the
elbow
of
the
*NL*
arm
that
held
the
narghile
,
and
extending
to
him
her
other
hand
,
said
,
*NL*
with
a
smile
of
captivating
sweetness
,
in
the
sonorous
language
spoken
*NL*
by
the
women
of
Athens
and
Sparta
,
``
Why
demand
permission
ere
you
enter
?
*NL*
Are
you
no
longer
my
master

or
have
I
ceased
to
be
your
slave

Monte
*NL*
Cristo
returned
her
smile
.

said
he
,
``

coldly

I

Oh

do
not

smiled

she
,
touching
her
eyes

her
heart

laughingly

*NL*
``

cried
she
,
with
tones
of
thrilling
tenderness

Monte

took
the
delicate
hand
of
the
young

in

his
,
and
was
about
to
raise
it
to
his
lips
,
when
the
simple
child
*NL*
of
nature
hastily
withdrew
it

and
presented
her
cheek

``
You
now

said
the

The

,
with
a
smile

profound

tenderness

extended
his

she
carried
it
to
her

Monte

thus
attuned
to
the
interview
he
proposed

departed

as

went
these
lines
of
Pindar

*NL*
``

The
carriage
was
prepared
according
to
orders
,
and
stepping
*NL*
lightly
into
it
,
the
count
drove
off
at
his
usual
rapid
pace

The

Family
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
very
few
minutes
the
count
reached
No.
7
in
the
Rue
Meslay
.
The
*NL*
house
was
of
white
stone
,
and
in
a
small
court
before
it
were
two
small
*NL*
beds
full
of
beautiful
flowers
.
In
the
concierge
that
opened
the
gate
*NL*
the
count
recognized
Cocles
;
but
as
he
had
but
one
eye
,
and
that
eye
*NL*
had
become
somewhat
dim
in
the
course
of
nine
years
,
Cocles
did
not
*NL*
recognize
the
count
.
The
carriages
that
drove
up
to
the
door
were
*NL*
compelled
to
turn
,
to
avoid
a
fountain
that
played
in
a
basin
of
*NL*
rockwork
,
--
an
ornament
that
had
excited
the
jealousy
of
the
whole
*NL*
quarter
,
and
had
gained
for
the
place
the
appellation
of
``
The
Little
*NL*
Versailles
.
''
It
is
needless
to
add
that
there
were
gold
and
silver
fish
*NL*
in
the
basin
.
The
house
,
with
kitchens
and
cellars
below
,
had
above
*NL*
the
ground-floor
,
two
stories
and
attics
.
The
whole
of
the
property
,
*NL*
consisting
of
an
immense
workshop
,
two
pavilions
at
the
bottom
of
the
*NL*
garden
,
and
the
garden
itself
,
had
been
purchased
by
Emmanuel
,
who
had
*NL*
seen
at
a
glance
that
he
could
make
of
it
a
profitable
speculation
.
He
*NL*
had
reserved
the
house
and
half
the
garden
,
and
building
a
wall
between
*NL*
the
garden
and
the
workshops
,
had
let
them
upon
lease
with
the
pavilions
*NL*
at
the
bottom
of
the
garden
.
So
that
for
a
trifling
sum
he
was
as
well
*NL*
lodged
,
and
as
perfectly
shut
out
from
observation
,
as
the
inhabitants
*NL*
of
the
finest
mansion
in
the
Faubourg
St.
Germain
.
The
breakfast-room
*NL*
was
finished
in
oak
;
the
salon
in
mahogany
,
and
the
furnishings
were
of
*NL*
blue
velvet
;
the
bedroom
was
in
citronwood
and
green
damask
.
There
was
*NL*
a
study
for
Emmanuel
,
who
never
studied
,
and
a
music-room
for
Julie
,
*NL*
who
never
played
.
The
whole
of
the
second
story
was
set
apart
for
*NL*
Maximilian
;
it
was
precisely
similar
to
his
sister
's
apartments
,
except
*NL*
that
for
the
breakfast-parlor
he
had
a
billiard-room
,
where
he
received
*NL*
his
friends
.
He
was
superintending
the
grooming
of
his
horse
,
and
*NL*
smoking
his
cigar
at
the
entrance
of
the
garden
,
when
the
count
's
*NL*
carriage
stopped
at
the
gate
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cocles
opened
the
gate
,
and
Baptistin
,
springing
from
the
box
,
inquired
*NL*
whether
Monsieur
and
Madame
Herbault
and
Monsieur
Maximilian
Morrel
*NL*
would
see
his
excellency
the
Count
of
Monte
Cristo
.
``
The
Count
of
Monte
*NL*
Cristo
?
''
cried
Morrel
,
throwing
away
his
cigar
and
hastening
to
the
*NL*
carriage
;
``
I
should
think
we
would
see
him
.
Ah
,
a
thousand
thanks
,
*NL*
count
,
for
not
having
forgotten
your
promise
.
''
And
the
young
officer
*NL*
shook
the
count
's
hand
so
warmly
,
that
Monte
Cristo
could
not
be
*NL*
mistaken
as
to
the
sincerity
of
his
joy
,
and
he
saw
that
he
had
been
*NL*
expected
with
impatience
,
and
was
received
with
pleasure
.
``
Come
,
come
,
''
*NL*
said
Maximilian
,
``
I
will
serve
as
your
guide
;
such
a
man

you
are
*NL*
ought
not
to
be
introduced

servant

My
sister
is
in
the
garden
*NL*
plucking
the
dead
roses
;
my
brother
is
reading
his
two
papers
,
the
*NL*
Presse
and
the
Debats
,
within
six
steps
of
her
;
for
wherever
you
see
*NL*
Madame
Herbault
,
you
have
only
to
look
within
a
circle
of
four
yards
*NL*
and
you
will
find
M.
Emmanuel
,
and
`
reciprocally
,
'
as
they
say
at
the
*NL*
Polytechnic
School
.

At
the
sound
of
their
steps
a
young
woman
of
twenty
*NL*
to
five
and
twenty
,
dressed
in
a
silk
morning
gown
,
and
busily
engaged
*NL*
in
plucking
the
dead
leaves
off
a
noisette
rose-tree
,
raised
her
head

*NL*
This
was
Julie
,
who
had
become
,
as
the
clerk
of
the
house
of
Thomson
*NL*
&
French
had
predicted
,
Madame
Emmanuel
Herbault
.
She
uttered
a
cry
*NL*
of
surprise
at
the
sight
of
a
stranger
,
and
Maximilian
began
to
laugh
.
*NL*
``
Do
n't
disturb
yourself

Julie

''
said
he
.
``
The
count
has
only
been
two
*NL*
or
three

he
already
knows

the

will
show

*NL*
``

returned
Julie

thus

never

any

An
old
man
,
who
was
digging
busily
at
one
of
the
beds
,
stuck
*NL*
his
spade
in
the
earth
,
and
approached
,
cap
in
hand
,
striving
to
conceal
*NL*
a
quid
of
tobacco
he
had
just
thrust
into
his
cheek
.
A
few
locks
of
*NL*
gray
mingled
with
his
hair
,
which
was
still
thick
and
matted
,
while
his
*NL*
bronzed
features
and
determined
glance
well
suited
an
old
sailor
who
had
*NL*
braved
the
heat
of
the
equator
and
the
storms
of
the
tropics
.
``
I

Penelon
had
still
preserved

and
*NL*
had
never
been
able
to
change

Then

turning
to
Monte

Cristo
,

``
I
hope
you
will
permit
me
to
leave
you
for
a

*NL*
continued
she
;
and
without
awaiting
any
reply
,
disappeared
behind
a
*NL*
clump
of
trees
,
and
escaped
to
the
house
by
a
lateral
alley
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sorry
to

Monte

to
Morrel
,
``
that
I
cause
no
*NL*
small
disturbance
in
your
house

*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
there

said
Maximilian
,
laughing
;

there
is
her

Your

yes

they
want
nothing
that

render
them
*NL*
happy

they
are
young

cheerful
,
they
are
tenderly
attached
to
each
*NL*
other
,
and
with
twenty-five
thousand
francs
a
year
they
fancy
themselves
*NL*
as
rich
as
Rothschild

*NL*
*NL*
``
Five

twenty
thousand

not
a
large
sum

*NL*
replied
Monte
Cristo
,
with
a
tone
so
sweet
and
gentle
,
that
it
went
to
*NL*
Maximilian
's
heart
like
the
voice
of
a
father
;
``
but
they
will
not
be
*NL*
content
with
that

Your
brother-in-law
is
a
barrister
?
a
doctor
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
was
a
merchant
,
monsieur
,
and
had
succeeded
to
the
business
of
my
*NL*
poor
father
.
M.
Morrel
,
at
his
death
,
left
500,000
francs
,
which
were
*NL*
divided
between
my
sister
and
myself
,
for
we
were
his
only
children
.
Her
*NL*
husband
,
who
,
when
he
married
her
,
had
no
other
patrimony
than
his
noble
*NL*
probity
,
his
first-rate
ability
,
and
his
spotless
reputation
,
wished
to
*NL*
possess
as
much
as
his
wife
.
He
labored
and
toiled
until
he
had
amassed
*NL*
250,000
francs
;
six
years
sufficed
to
achieve
this
object
.
Oh
,
I
assure
*NL*
you
,
sir
,
it
was
a
touching
spectacle
to
see
these
young
creatures
,
*NL*
destined
by
their
talents
for
higher
stations
,
toiling
together
,
and
*NL*
through
their
unwillingness
to
change
any
of
the
customs
of
their
*NL*
paternal
house
,
taking
six
years
to
accomplish
what
less
scrupulous
*NL*
people
would
have
effected
in
two
or
three
.
Marseilles
resounded
with
*NL*
their
well-earned
praises
.
At
last
,
one
day
,
Emmanuel
came
to
his
wife
,
*NL*
who
had
just
finished
making
up
the
accounts
.
`
Julie
,
'
said
he
to
her
,
*NL*
`
Cocles
has
just
given
me
the
last
rouleau
of
a
hundred
francs
;
that
*NL*
completes
the
250,000
francs
we
had
fixed
as
the
limits
of
our
gains
.
*NL*
Can
you
content
yourself
with
the
small
fortune
which
we
shall
possess
*NL*
for
the
future
?
Listen
to
me
.
Our
house
transacts
business
to
the
amount
*NL*
of
a
million
a
year
,
from
which
we
derive
an
income
of
40,000
francs
.
*NL*
We
can
dispose
of
the
business
,
if
we
please
,
in
an
hour
,
for
I
have
*NL*
received
a
letter
from
M.
Delaunay
,
in
which
he
offers
to
purchase
*NL*
the
good-will
of
the
house
,
to
unite
with
his
own
,
for
300,000
francs
.
*NL*
Advise
me
what
I
had
better
do
.

--
'Em
manuel
,
'
returned
my
sister
,
`
the
*NL*
house
of
Morrel
can
only
be
carried
on
by
a
Morrel
.
Is
it
not
worth
*NL*
300,000
francs
to
save
our
father
's
name
from
the
chances
of
evil
*NL*
fortune
and
failure
?
'
--
'
I
thought
so
,
'
replied
Emmanuel
;
`
but
I
wished
*NL*
to
have
your
advice
.
'
--
`
This
is
my
counsel
:
--
Our
accounts
are
made
up
*NL*
and
our
bills
paid
;
all
we
have
to
do
is
to
stop
the
issue
of
any
more
,
*NL*
and
close
our
office
.
'
This
was
done
instantly
.
It
was
three
o'clock
;
at
*NL*
a
quarter
past
,
a
merchant
presented
himself
to
insure
two
ships
;
it
was
*NL*
a
clear
profit
of
15,000
.
francs
.
`
Monsieur
,
'
said
Emmanuel
,
`
have
*NL*
the
goodness
to
address
yourself
to
M.
Delaunay
.
We
have
quitted
*NL*
business
.
'
--
`
How
long
?
'
inquired
the
astonished
merchant
.
'
A
quarter
of
*NL*
an
hour
,
'
was
the
reply
.
And
this
is
the
reason
,
monsieur
,
''
continued
*NL*
Maximilian
,
``
of
my
sister
and
brother-in-law
having
only
25,000
francs
a
*NL*
year
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maximilian
had
scarcely
finished
his
story
,
during
which
the
count
's
*NL*
heart
had
swelled
within
him
,
when
Emmanuel
entered
wearing
a
hat
and
*NL*
coat
.
He
saluted
the
count
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
is
aware
of
the
*NL*
rank
of
his
guest
;
then
,
after
having
led
Monte
Cristo
around
the
little
*NL*
garden
,
he
returned
to
the
house
.
A
large
vase
of
Japan
porcelain
,
*NL*
filled
with
flowers
that
loaded
the
air
with
their
perfume
,
stood
in
*NL*
the
salon
.
Julie
,
suitably
dressed
,
and
her
hair
arranged
-LRB-
she
had
*NL*
accomplished
this
feat
in
less
than
ten
minutes
-RRB-
,
received
the
count
on
*NL*
his
entrance
.
The
songs
of
the
birds
were
heard
in
an
aviary
hard
by
,
*NL*
and
the
branches
of
laburnums
and
rose
acacias
formed
an
exquisite
*NL*
framework
to
the
blue
velvet
curtains
.
Everything
in
this
charming
*NL*
retreat
,
from
the
warble
of
the
birds
to
the
smile
of
the
mistress
,
*NL*
breathed
tranquillity
and
repose
.
The
count
had
felt
the
influence
of
*NL*
this
happiness
from
the
moment
he
entered
the
house
,
and
he
remained
*NL*
silent
and
pensive
,
forgetting
that
he
was
expected
to
renew
the
*NL*
conversation
,
which
had
ceased
after
the
first
salutations
had
been
*NL*
exchanged
.
The
silence
became
almost
painful
when
,
by
a
violent
effort
,
*NL*
tearing
himself
from
his
pleasing
reverie
--
``
Madame
,
''
said
he
at
length
,
*NL*
``
I
pray
you
to
excuse
my
emotion
,
which
must
astonish
you
who
are
only
*NL*
accustomed
to
the
happiness
I
meet
here
;
but
contentment
is
so
new
a
*NL*
sight
to
me
,
that
I
could
never
be
weary
of
looking
at
yourself
and
your
*NL*
husband
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
very
happy
,
monsieur
,
''
replied
Julie
;
``
but
we
have
also
known
*NL*
unhappiness
,
and
few
have
ever
undergone
more
bitter
sufferings
than
*NL*
ourselves

''
The
Count
's
features
displayed
an
expression
of
the
most
*NL*
intense
curiosity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
all
this
is
a
family
history
,
as
Chateau-Renaud
told
you
the
other
*NL*
day
,
''
observed
Maximilian
.
``
This
humble
picture
would
have
but
little
*NL*
interest

you

accustomed

you
are
to
behold
the
pleasures

the
*NL*
misfortunes
of
the
wealthy
and
industrious
;
but
such
as
we
are
,
we
have
*NL*
experienced
bitter
sorrows
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
God
has
poured
balm
into
your
wounds

as
he
does
into
those

said
Monte
Cristo
inquiringly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

''
returned
Julie
,
``
we
may
indeed
say
he
has
,
for
he
has
done
*NL*
for
us
what
he
grants
only
to
his
chosen
;
he
sent
us
one
of
his
angels

''
*NL*
The
count
's
cheeks
became
scarlet
,
and
he
coughed
,
in
order
to
have
an
*NL*
excuse
for
putting
his
handkerchief
to
his
mouth
.
``
Those
born
to
wealth
,
*NL*
and
who
have
the
means
of
gratifying
every
wish

Emmanuel
,
``

*NL*
not

is

real
happiness

been

the
stormy
waters
of
the
ocean
on
a
few
frail
planks
can
alone
*NL*
realize

blessings

*NL*
*NL*
Monte
Cristo
rose
,
and
without
making
any
answer
-LRB-
for
the
tremulousness
*NL*
of
his
voice
would
have
betrayed
his
emotion
-RRB-
walked
up
and
down
the
*NL*
apartment
with
a
slow
step

*NL*
``
Our
magnificence

you

Maximilian
,
who
had
*NL*
followed
him
with
his
eyes

``
No

no

returned
Monte
Cristo
,
pale
as
*NL*
death
,
pressing
one
hand
on
his
heart
to
still
its
throbbings
,
while
*NL*
with
the
other
he
pointed
to
a
crystal
cover
,
beneath
which
a
silken
*NL*
purse
lay
on
a
black
velvet
cushion
.
``
I
was
wondering
what

Maximilian

grew
uneasy

looked
at
him

``
An

you
say

represented

It
was

this
that

name
,
but
a
fictitious
one

''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
noticing
that
Julie
was
struck
with
the
sound
of
his
voice
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
,
''
continued
he
,
``
was
he
not
about
my
height
,
perhaps
a
little
*NL*
taller
,
with
his
chin
imprisoned
,
as
it
were
,
in
a
high
cravat
;
his
coat
*NL*
closely
buttoned
up
,
and
constantly
taking
out
his
pencil
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
do
you
then
know
him
?
''
cried
Julie
,
whose
eyes
sparkled
with
joy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
returned
Monte
Cristo
``
I
only
guessed
.
I
knew
a
Lord
Wilmore
,
who
*NL*
was
constantly
doing
actions
of
this
kind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Without
revealing
himself
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
was
an
eccentric
being
,
and
did
not
believe
in
the
existence
of
*NL*
gratitude
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
heaven
,
''
exclaimed
Julie
,
clasping
her
hands
,
``
in
what
did
he
*NL*
believe
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
did
not
credit
it
at
the
period
which
I
knew
him
,
''
said
Monte
*NL*
Cristo
,
touched
to
the
heart
by
the
accents
of
Julie
's
voice
;
``
but
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
since
then
he
has
had
proofs
that
gratitude
does
exist
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
do
you
know
this
gentleman

monsieur

inquired
Emmanuel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
if
you
do
know
him

''
cried
Julie
,
``
can
you
tell
us
where
he
*NL*
is

where
we
can
find
him

Maximilian
--
Emmanuel
--
if
we
do
but
discover
*NL*
him
,
he
must
believe
in
the
gratitude
of
the
heart
!
''
Monte
Cristo
felt
*NL*
tears
start
into
his
eyes
,
and
he
again
walked
hastily
up
and
down
the
*NL*
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
name
of
heaven
,
''
said
Maximilian
,
``
if
you
know
anything
of
him
,
*NL*
tell
us
what
it
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas
,
''
cried
Monte
Cristo
,
striving
to
repress
his
emotion
,
``
if
Lord
*NL*
Wilmore
was
your
unknown
benefactor
,
I
fear
you
will
never
see
him
*NL*
again
.
I
parted
from
him
two
years
ago
at
Palermo
,
and
he
was
then
on
*NL*
the
point
of
setting
out
for
the
most
remote
regions
;
so
that
I
fear
he
*NL*
will
never
return
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
monsieur
,
this
is
cruel
of
you
,
''
said
Julie
,
much
affected
;
and
the
*NL*
young
lady
's
eyes
swam
with
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madame
,
''
replied
Monte
Cristo
gravely
,
and
gazing
earnestly
on
the
two
*NL*
liquid
pearls
that
trickled
down
Julie
's
cheeks
,
``
had
Lord
Wilmore
seen
*NL*
what
I
now
see
,
he
would
become
attached
to
life
,
for
the
tears
you
shed
*NL*
would
reconcile
him
to
mankind
;
''
and
he
held
out
his
hand
to
Julie
,
who
*NL*
gave
him
hers
,
carried
away
by
the
look
and
accent
of
the
count
.
``
But
,
''
*NL*
continued
she
,
``
Lord
Wilmore
had
a
family

he
must
have
known

we
not

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it
is
useless
to
inquire

''
returned
the
count
;
``
perhaps
,
after
all
,
*NL*
he
was
not
the
man
you
seek
for

He
was
my
friend
:
he
had
no
secrets
*NL*
from
me
,
and
if
this
had
been
so
he
would
have
confided
in
me

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
he
told
you
nothing

*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
a

Nothing

*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing

Ah

``
Sister

''
said
Maximilian
,
coming
to
the
count
's
aid
,
``
monsieur
*NL*
is
quite
right
.
Recollect
what
our
excellent
father
so
often
told
us
,
*NL*

It
was
no
Englishman
that
thus
saved
us
.

''
Monte
Cristo
started
.
``
What
*NL*
did
your
father
tell
you
,
M.
Morrel
?
''
said
he
eagerly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
father
thought
that
this
action
had
been
miraculously
performed
--
he
*NL*
believed
that
a
benefactor
had
arisen
from
the
grave
to
save
us
.
Oh
,
*NL*
it
was
a
touching
superstition
,
monsieur
,
and
although
I
did
not
myself
*NL*
believe
it
,
I
would
not
for
the
world
have
destroyed
my
father
's
faith
.
*NL*
How
often
did
he
muse
over
it
and
pronounce
the
name
of
a
dear
friend
--
a
*NL*
friend
lost
to
him
forever
;
and
on
his
death-bed
,
when
the
near
approach
*NL*
of
eternity
seemed
to
have
illumined
his
mind
with
supernatural
*NL*
light
,
this
thought
,
which
had
until
then
been
but
a
doubt
,
became
*NL*
a
conviction
,
and
his
last
words
were
,
`
Maximilian
,
it
was
Edmond
*NL*
Dantes
!
'
''
At
these
words
the
count
's
paleness
,
which
had
for
some
time
*NL*
been
increasing
,
became
alarming
;
he
could
not
speak
;
he
looked
at
his
*NL*
watch
like
a
man
who
has
forgotten
the
hour
,
said
a
few
hurried
words
*NL*
to
Madame
Herbault
,
and
pressing
the
hands
of
Emmanuel
and
*NL*
Maximilian
,
--
``
Madame

said
he
,
``
I
trust
you
will
allow
me

visit
you

for
this
is
the
first
time
for
many

thus

and
he
hastily
quitted
the
apartment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
Count
of
Monte

is
a
strange

said
Emmanuel

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

answered
Maximilian

I

*NL*
``
His

went
to

Pyramus
and
Thisbe
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
two-thirds
of
the
way
along
the
Faubourg
Saint-Honore
,
and
in
the
*NL*
rear
of
one
of
the
most
imposing
mansions
in
this
rich
neighborhood
,
*NL*
where
the
various
houses
vie
with
each
other
for
elegance
of
design
*NL*
and
magnificence
of
construction
,
extended
a
large
garden
,
where
the
*NL*
wide-spreading
chestnut-trees
raised
their
heads
high
above
the
walls
in
*NL*
a
solid
rampart
,
and
with
the
coming
of
every
spring
scattered
a
shower
*NL*
of
delicate
pink
and
white
blossoms
into
the
large
stone
vases
that
*NL*
stood
upon
the
two
square
pilasters
of
a
curiously
wrought
iron
gate
,
*NL*
that
dated
from
the
time
of
Louis
XII
.
This
noble
entrance
,
however
,
*NL*
in
spite
of
its
striking
appearance
and
the
graceful
effect
of
the
*NL*
geraniums
planted
in
the
two
vases
,
as
they
waved
their
variegated
*NL*
leaves
in
the
wind
and
charmed
the
eye
with
their
scarlet
bloom
,
had
*NL*
fallen
into
utter
disuse
.
The
proprietors
of
the
mansion
had
many
years
*NL*
before
thought
it
best
to
confine
themselves
to
the
possession
of
the
*NL*
house
itself
,
with
its
thickly
planted
court-yard
,
opening
into
the
*NL*
Faubourg
Saint-Honore
,
and
to
the
garden
shut
in
by
this
gate
,
which
*NL*
formerly
communicated
with
a
fine
kitchen-garden
of
about
an
acre
.
For
*NL*
the
demon
of
speculation
drew
a
line
,
or
in
other
words
projected
a
*NL*
street
,
at
the
farther
side
of
the
kitchen-garden
.
The
street
was
*NL*
laid
out
,
a
name
was
chosen
and
posted
up
on
an
iron
plate
,
but
before
*NL*
construction
was
begun
,
it
occurred
to
the
possessor
of
the
property
*NL*
that
a
handsome
sum
might
be
obtained
for
the
ground
then
devoted
*NL*
to
fruits
and
vegetables
,
by
building
along
the
line
of
the
proposed
*NL*
street
,
and
so
making
it
a
branch
of
communication
with
the
Faubourg
*NL*
Saint-Honore
itself
,
one
of
the
most
important
thoroughfares
in
the
city
*NL*
of
Paris
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
matters
of
speculation
,
however
,
though
``
man
proposes
,
''
``
money
*NL*
disposes
.
''
From
some
such
difficulty
the
newly
named
street
died
almost
*NL*
in
birth
,
and
the
purchaser
of
the
kitchen-garden
,
having
paid
a
high
*NL*
price
for
it
,
and
being
quite
unable
to
find
any
one
willing
to
take
his
*NL*
bargain
off
his
hands
without
a
considerable
loss
,
yet
still
clinging
*NL*
to
the
belief
that
at
some
future
day
he
should
obtain
a
sum
for
it
that
*NL*
would
repay
him
,
not
only
for
his
past
outlay
,
but
also
the
interest
*NL*
upon
the
capital
locked
up
in
his
new
acquisition
,
contented
himself
*NL*
with
letting
the
ground
temporarily
to
some
market-gardeners
,
at
a
*NL*
yearly
rental
of
500
francs
.
And
so
,
as
we
have
said
,
the
iron
gate
*NL*
leading
into
the
kitchen-garden
had
been
closed
up
and
left
to
the
rust
,
*NL*
which
bade
fair
before
long
to
eat
off
its
hinges
,
while
to
prevent
the
*NL*
ignoble
glances
of
the
diggers
and
delvers
of
the
ground
from
presuming
*NL*
to
sully
the
aristocratic
enclosure
belonging
to
the
mansion
,
the
gate
*NL*
had
been
boarded
up
to
a
height
of
six
feet
.
True
,
the
planks
were
not
*NL*
so
closely
adjusted
but
that
a
hasty
peep
might
be
obtained
through
*NL*
their
interstices
;
but
the
strict
decorum
and
rigid
propriety
of
the
*NL*
inhabitants
of
the
house
left
no
grounds
for
apprehending
that
advantage
*NL*
would
be
taken
of
that
circumstance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Horticulture
seemed
,
however
,
to
have
been
abandoned
in
the
deserted
*NL*
kitchen-garden
;
and
where
cabbages
,
carrots
,
radishes
,
pease
,
and
melons
*NL*
had
once
flourished
,
a
scanty
crop
of
lucerne
alone
bore
evidence
of
its
*NL*
being
deemed
worthy
of
cultivation
.
A
small
,
low
door
gave
egress
from
*NL*
the
walled
space
we
have
been
describing
into
the
projected
street
,
the
*NL*
ground
having
been
abandoned
as
unproductive
by
its
various
renters
,
and
*NL*
had
now
fallen
so
completely
in
general
estimation
as
to
return
not
*NL*
even
the
one-half
per
cent
it
had
originally
paid
.
Towards
the
house
*NL*
the
chestnut-trees
we
have
before
mentioned
rose
high
above
the
wall
,
*NL*
without
in
any
way
affecting
the
growth
of
other
luxuriant
shrubs
and
*NL*
flowers
that
eagerly
dressed
forward
to
fill
up
the
vacant
spaces
,
as
*NL*
though
asserting
their
right
to
enjoy
the
boon
of
light
and
air
.
At
one
*NL*
corner
,
where
the
foliage
became
so
thick
as
almost
to
shut
out
day
,
a
*NL*
large
stone
bench
and
sundry
rustic
seats
indicated
that
this
sheltered
*NL*
spot
was
either
in
general
favor
or
particular
use
by
some
inhabitant
*NL*
of
the
house
,
which
was
faintly
discernible
through
the
dense
mass
of
*NL*
verdure
that
partially
concealed
it
,
though
situated
but
a
hundred
paces
*NL*
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whoever
had
selected
this
retired
portion
of
the
grounds
as
the
boundary
*NL*
of
a
walk
,
or
as
a
place
for
meditation
,
was
abundantly
justified
in
*NL*
the
choice
by
the
absence
of
all
glare
,
the
cool
,
refreshing
shade
,
the
*NL*
screen
it
afforded
from
the
scorching
rays
of
the
sun
,
that
found
no
*NL*
entrance
there
even
during
the
burning
days
of
hottest
summer
,
the
*NL*
incessant
and
melodious
warbling
of
birds
,
and
the
entire
removal
from
*NL*
either
the
noise
of
the
street
or
the
bustle
of
the
mansion
.
On
the
*NL*
evening
of
one
of
the
warmest
days
spring
had
yet
bestowed
on
the
*NL*
inhabitants
of
Paris
,
might
be
seen
negligently
thrown
upon
the
stone
*NL*
bench
,
a
book
,
a
parasol
,
and
a
work-basket
,
from
which
hung
a
partly
*NL*
embroidered
cambric
handkerchief
,
while
at
a
little
distance
from
these
*NL*
articles
was
a
young
woman
,
standing
close
to
the
iron
gate
,
endeavoring
*NL*
to
discern
something
on
the
other
side
by
means
of
the
openings
in
the
*NL*
planks
,
--
the
earnestness
of
her
attitude
and
the
fixed
gaze
with
which
*NL*
she
seemed
to
seek
the
object
of
her
wishes
,
proving
how
much
her
*NL*
feelings
were
interested
in
the
matter
.
At
that
instant
the
little
*NL*
side-gate
leading
from
the
waste
ground
to
the
street
was
noiselessly
*NL*
opened
,
and
a
tall
,
powerful
young
man
appeared
.
He
was
dressed
in
a
*NL*
common
gray
blouse
and
velvet
cap
,
but
his
carefully
arranged
hair
,
*NL*
beard
and
mustache
,
all
of
the
richest
and
glossiest
black
,
ill
accorded
*NL*
with
his
plebeian
attire
.
After
casting
a
rapid
glance
around
him
,
in
*NL*
order
to
assure
himself
that
he
was
unobserved
,
he
entered
by
the
small
*NL*
gate
,
and
,
carefully
closing
and
securing
it
after
him
,
proceeded
with
a
*NL*
hurried
step
towards
the
barrier
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
sight
of
him
she
expected
,
though
probably
not
in
such
a
costume
,
*NL*
the
young
woman
started
in
terror
,
and
was
about
to
make
a
hasty
*NL*
retreat
.
But
the
eye
of
love
had
already
seen
,
even
through
the
narrow
*NL*
chinks
of
the
wooden
palisades
,
the
movement
of
the
white
robe
,
and
*NL*
observed
the
fluttering
of
the
blue
sash
.
Pressing
his
lips
close
to
the
*NL*
planks
,
he
exclaimed
,
``
Do
n't
be
alarmed
,
Valentine
--
it
is
I
!
''
Again
the
*NL*
timid
girl
found
courage
to
return
to
the
gate
,
saying
,
as
she
did
so
,
*NL*
``
And
why
do
you
come
so
late
to-day
?
It
is
almost
dinner-time
,
and
I
had
*NL*
to
use
no
little
diplomacy
to
get
rid
of
my
watchful
mother-in-law
,
my
*NL*
too-devoted
maid
,
and
my
troublesome
brother
,
who
is
always
teasing
me
*NL*
about
coming
to
work
at
my
embroidery
,
which
I
am
in
a
fair
way
never
to
*NL*
get
done
.
So
pray
excuse
yourself
as
well
as
you
can
for
having
made
me
*NL*
wait
,
and
,
after
that
,
tell
me
why
I
see
you
in

dress

singular
that
*NL*
at
first
I
did
not
recognize
you

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dearest
Valentine
,
''
said
the
young
man
,
``
the
difference
between
our
*NL*
respective
stations
makes
me
fear
to
offend
you
by
speaking
of
my
love
,
*NL*
but
yet
I
can
not
find
myself
in
your
presence
without
longing
to
pour
*NL*
forth
my
soul
,
and
tell
you
how
fondly
I
adore
you
.
If
it
be
but
to
*NL*
carry
away
with
me
the
recollection
of
such
sweet
moments
,
I
could
even
*NL*
thank
you
for
chiding
me
,
for
it
leaves
me
a
gleam
of
hope
,
that
if
*NL*
you
did
not
expect
me
-LRB-
and
that
indeed
would
be
worse
than
vanity
to
*NL*
suppose
-RRB-
,
at
least
I
was
in
your
thoughts
.
You
asked
me
the
cause
of
my
*NL*
being
late
,
and
why
I
come
disguised
.
I
will
candidly
explain
the
reason
*NL*
of
both
,
and
I
trust
to
your
goodness
to
pardon
me
.
I
have
chosen
a
*NL*
trade
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
trade
?
Oh
,
Maximilian
,
how
can
you
jest
at
a
time
when
we
have
such
*NL*
deep
cause
for
uneasiness
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Heaven
keep
me
from
jesting
with
that
which
is
far
dearer
to
me
than
*NL*
life
itself

But
listen
to
me
,
Valentine
,
and
I
will
tell
you
all
about
*NL*
it
.
I
became
weary
of
ranging
fields
and
scaling
walls
,
and
seriously
*NL*
alarmed
at
the
idea
suggested
by
you
,
that
if
caught
hovering
about
here
*NL*
your
father
would
very
likely
have
me
sent
to
prison
as
a
thief
.
That
*NL*
would
compromise
the
honor
of
the
French
army
,
to
say
nothing
of
the
*NL*
fact
that
the
continual
presence
of
a
captain
of
Spahis
in
a
place
*NL*
where
no
warlike
projects
could
be
supposed
to
account
for
it
might
well
*NL*
create
surprise
;
so
I
have
become
a
gardener
,
and
,
consequently
,
adopted
*NL*
the
costume
of
my
calling
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
excessive
nonsense
you
talk
,
Maximilian

*NL*
``
Nonsense

Pray
do
not
call
what
I
consider
the

action
of
my
life

by
such

Consider

by
becoming
a
gardener
I
effectually
screen
*NL*
our
meetings
from
all
suspicion

*NL*

tell
me

you

really
mean

*NL*
*NL*
``
Simply
,
that
having
ascertained
that
the
piece
of
ground
on
which
I
*NL*
stand
was
to
let
,
I
made
application
for
it
,
was
readily
accepted
by
*NL*
the
proprietor
,
and
am
now
master
of
this
fine
crop
of
lucerne
.
Think
*NL*
of
that
,
Valentine
!
There
is
nothing
now
to
prevent
my
building
myself
*NL*
a
little
hut
on
my
plantation
,
and
residing
not
twenty
yards
from
you
.
*NL*
Only
imagine
what
happiness
that
would
afford
me
.
I
can
scarcely
contain
*NL*
myself
at
the
bare
idea
.
Such
felicity
seems
above
all
price
--
as
a
thing
*NL*
impossible
and
unattainable
.
But
would
you
believe
that
I
purchase
all
*NL*
this
delight
,
joy
,
and
happiness
,
for
which
I
would
cheerfully
have
*NL*
surrendered
ten
years
of
my
life
,
at
the
small
cost
of
500
francs
per
*NL*
annum
,
paid
quarterly
?
Henceforth
we
have
nothing
to
fear
.
I
am
on
my
*NL*
own
ground
,
and
have
an
undoubted
right
to
place
a
ladder
against
the
*NL*
wall
,
and
to
look
over
when
I
please
,
without
having
any
apprehensions
*NL*
of
being
taken
off
by
the
police
as
a
suspicious
character
.
I
may
also
*NL*
enjoy
the
precious
privilege
of
assuring
you
of
my
fond
,
faithful
,
and
*NL*
unalterable
affection
,
whenever
you
visit
your
favorite
bower
,
unless
,
*NL*
indeed
,
it
offends
your
pride
to
listen
to
professions
of
love
from
the
*NL*
lips
of
a
poor
workingman

clad
in
a
blouse
and
cap

''
A
faint
cry
of
*NL*
mingled
pleasure
and
surprise
escaped
from
the
lips
of
Valentine
,
who
*NL*
almost
instantly
said
,
in
a
saddened
tone
,
as
though
some
envious
cloud
*NL*
darkened
the
joy
which
illumined
her
heart
,
``
Alas
,
no
,
Maximilian
,
this
*NL*
must
not
be
,
for
many
reasons
.
We
should
presume
too
much
on
our
*NL*
own
strength
,
and
,
like
others
,
perhaps
,
be
led
astray
by
our
blind
*NL*
confidence
in
each
other
's
prudence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
you
for
an
instant
entertain
so
unworthy
a
thought
,
dear
*NL*
Valentine
?
Have
I
not
,
from
the
first
blessed
hour
of
our
acquaintance
,
*NL*
schooled
all
my
words
and
actions
to
your
sentiments
and
ideas
?
And
you
*NL*
have
,
I
am
sure
,
the
fullest
confidence
in
my
honor
.
When
you
spoke
*NL*
to
me
of
experiencing
a
vague
and
indefinite
sense
of
coming
danger
,
*NL*
I
placed
myself
blindly
and
devotedly
at
your
service
,
asking
no
other
*NL*
reward
than
the
pleasure
of
being
useful
to
you
;
and
have
I
ever
since
,
*NL*
by
word
or
look
,
given
you
cause
of
regret
for
having
selected
me
from
*NL*
the
numbers
that
would
willingly
have
sacrificed
their
lives
for
you
?
*NL*
You
told
me
,
my
dear
Valentine
,
that
you
were
engaged
to
M.
d'Epinay
,
*NL*
and
that
your
father
was
resolved
upon
completing
the
match
,
and
that
*NL*
from
his
will
there
was
no
appeal
,
as
M.
de
Villefort
was
never
known
*NL*
to
change
a
determination
once
formed
.
I
kept
in
the
background
,
as
you
*NL*
wished
,
and
waited
,
not
for
the
decision
of
your
heart
or
my
own
,
but
*NL*
hoping
that
providence
would
graciously
interpose
in
our
behalf
,
and
*NL*
order
events
in
our
favor
.
But
what
cared
I
for
delays
or
difficulties
,
*NL*
Valentine
,
as
long
as
you
confessed
that
you
loved
me
,
and
took
pity
*NL*
on
me
?
If
you
will
only
repeat
that
avowal
now
and
then
,
I
can
endure
*NL*
anything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
Maximilian
,
that
is
the
very
thing
that
makes
you
so
bold
,
and
*NL*
which
renders
me
at
once
so
happy
and
unhappy
,
that
I
frequently
*NL*
ask
myself
whether
it
is
better
for
me
to
endure
the
harshness
of
my
*NL*
mother-in-law
,
and
her
blind
preference
for
her
own
child
,
or
to
be
,
*NL*
as
I
now
am
,
insensible
to
any
pleasure
save
such
as
I
find
in
these
*NL*
meetings
,
so
fraught
with
danger
to
both
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
not
admit
that
word
,
''
returned
the
young
man
;
``
it
is
at
once
*NL*
cruel
and
unjust
.
Is
it
possible
to
find
a
more
submissive
slave
than
*NL*
myself
?
You
have
permitted
me
to
converse
with
you
from
time
to
*NL*
time
,
Valentine
,
but
forbidden
my
ever
following
you
in
your
walks
or
*NL*
elsewhere
--
have
I
not
obeyed
?
And
since
I
found
means
to
enter
this
*NL*
enclosure
to
exchange
a
few
words
with
you
through
this
gate
--
to
be
*NL*
close
to
you
without
really
seeing
you
--
have
I
ever
asked
so
much
as
to
*NL*
touch
the
hem
of
your
gown
or
tried
to
pass
this
barrier
which
is
but
*NL*
a
trifle
to
one
of
my
youth
and
strength
?
Never
has
a
complaint
or
a
*NL*
murmur
escaped
me
.
I
have
been
bound
by
my
promises
as
rigidly
as
any
*NL*
knight
of
olden
times
.
Come
,
come
,
dearest
Valentine
,
confess
that
what
*NL*
I
say
is
true
,
lest
I
be
tempted
to
call
you
unjust
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
true
,
''
said
Valentine
,
as
she
passed
the
end
of
her
slender
*NL*
fingers
through
a
small
opening
in
the
planks
,
and
permitted
Maximilian
*NL*
to
press
his
lips
to
them
,
``
and
you
are
a
true
and
faithful
friend
;
but
*NL*
still
you
acted
from
motives
of
self-interest
,
my
dear
Maximilian
,
*NL*
for
you
well
knew
that
from
the
moment
in
which
you
had
manifested
an
*NL*
opposite
spirit
all
would
have
been
ended
between
us
.
You
promised
to
*NL*
bestow
on
me
the
friendly
affection
of
a
brother
.
For
I
have
no
friend
*NL*
but
yourself
upon
earth
,
who
am
neglected
and
forgotten
by
my
father
,
*NL*
harassed
and
persecuted
by
my
mother-in-law
,
and
left
to
the
sole
*NL*
companionship
of
a
paralyzed
and
speechless
old
man
,
whose
withered
hand
*NL*
can
no
longer
press
mine
,
and
who
can
speak
to
me
with
the
eye
alone
,
*NL*
although
there
still
lingers
in
his
heart
the
warmest
tenderness
for
*NL*
his
poor
grandchild
.
Oh
,
how
bitter
a
fate
is
mine
,
to
serve
either
as
*NL*
a
victim
or
an
enemy
to
all
who
are
stronger
than
myself
,
while
my
only
*NL*
friend
and
supporter
is
a
living
corpse
!
Indeed
,
indeed
,
Maximilian
,
I
*NL*
am
very
miserable
,
and
if
you
love
me
it
must
be
out
of
pity
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Valentine
,
''
replied
the
young
man
,
deeply
affected
,
``
I
will
not
say
*NL*
you
are
all
I
love
in
the
world

for
I
dearly
prize
my
sister
and
*NL*
brother-in-law
;
but
my
affection
for
them
is
calm
and
tranquil
,
in
no
*NL*
manner
resembling
what
I
feel
for
you
.
When
I
think
of
you
my
heart
*NL*
beats
fast
,
the
blood
burns
in
my
veins
,
and
I
can
hardly
breathe
;
but
*NL*
I
solemnly
promise
you
to
restrain
all
this
ardor
,
this
fervor
and
*NL*
intensity
of
feeling
,
until
you
yourself
shall
require
me
to
render
*NL*
them
available
in
serving
or
assisting
you

M.
Franz
is
not
expected
to
*NL*
return
home
for
a
year
to
come
,
I
am
told
;
in
that
time
many
favorable
*NL*
and
unforeseen
chances
may
befriend
us

Let
us
,
then
,
hope
for
the
best
;
*NL*
hope
is
so
sweet
a
comforter

Meanwhile
,
Valentine
,
while
reproaching
me
*NL*
with
selfishness
,
think
a
little
what
you
have
been
to
me
--
the
beautiful
*NL*
but
cold
resemblance
of
a
marble
Venus
.
What
promise
of
future
*NL*
reward
have
you
made
me
for
all
the
submission
and
obedience
I
have
*NL*
evinced
?
--
none
whatever
.
What
granted
me
?
--
scarcely
more
.
You
tell
me
of
*NL*
M.
Franz
d'Epinay
,
your
betrothed
lover
,
and
you
shrink
from
the
idea
of
*NL*
being
his
wife
;
but
tell
me
,
Valentine
,
is
there
no
other
sorrow
in
your
*NL*
heart
?
You
see
me
devoted
to
you
,
body
and
soul
,
my
life
and
each
warm
*NL*
drop
that
circles
round
my
heart
are
consecrated
to
your
service
;
you
*NL*
know
full
well
that
my
existence
is
bound
up
in
yours
--
that
were
I
to
*NL*
lose
you
I
would
not
outlive
the
hour
of
such
crushing
misery
;
yet
you
*NL*
speak
with
calmness
of
the
prospect
of
your
being
the
wife
of
another
!
*NL*
Oh
,
Valentine
,
were
I
in
your
place
,
and
did
I
feel
conscious
,
as
you
*NL*
do
,
of
being
worshipped
,
adored
,
with
such
a
love
as
mine
,
a
hundred
*NL*
times
at
least
should
I
have
passed
my
hand
between
these
iron
bars
,
and
*NL*
said
,
`
Take
this
hand

dearest
Maximilian

believe
that

living

dead

I
am
yours

yours
only

forever

The
poor
girl
made
no
*NL*
reply
,
but
her
lover
could
plainly
hear
her
sobs
and
tears
.
A
rapid
*NL*
change
took
place
in
the
young
man
's
feelings

``
Dearest

exclaimed
he

``

pain

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

answered
she
,
``

do

not

stranger

my
father

house

where
even
he
is
seldom
seen

whose
will
has
been
*NL*
thwarted

spirits
broken

from
the
age
of
ten
years

beneath
the
*NL*
iron
rod

sternly
held
over

by

even
observed
my
sufferings

have
I
ever

Outwardly

in

eyes
of
the

I
am
*NL*
surrounded
by
kindness

the
reverse

The

general
remark

`
Oh

it
can
not
be
expected
that
one
of
so
stern
a
*NL*
character

M.
Villefort
could
lavish
the
tenderness
some
fathers
do
*NL*
on
their
daughters

What
though
she
has
lost
her
own
mother
at
a
tender
*NL*
age

she
has
had
the
happiness
to
find
a
second
mother

Villefort

'
The
world

however

is
mistaken
;
my
father
abandons
me
from
*NL*
utter
indifference

while
my
mother-in-law
detests
me
with
a
hatred
so

much
the
more
terrible

beneath

the
weeping

own

just

this

I
exchange
the
half

at

sharing
my

*NL*
``
Poor

''
*NL*
*NL*

I
seem
to
myself
as
though
living
a
life
of
bondage

yet
at
the

am
so
conscious
of
my

weakness
that
I
fear
to
break
the
*NL*
restraint
in

I
am
held
,
lest
I
fall
utterly
helpless

Then
,
too

*NL*
my

is
not

whose
orders
may
be
infringed
with
impunity
;
*NL*
protected
as
he

by
his

unswerving
integrity

no
one
could
oppose
him

he
is
all-powerful

believe
me

you

my

*NL*

But
why

Valentine

do
you
persist
in
anticipating
the
worst
,

why
*NL*
picture
so
gloomy
a
future
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
I
judge
it
from

*NL*
*NL*

Still

consider
that

not
be

what

for
you
,
I
am
,
for
many
reasons
,
*NL*
not
altogether
so
much
beneath

The
days
when
such
*NL*
distinctions
were
so
nicely
weighed
and
considered
no
longer

in
*NL*
France
,
and
the
first
families
of
the
monarchy
have
intermarried
with

those
of
the
empire

The
aristocracy
of
the
lance
has
allied
itself
with
*NL*
the
nobility
of
the
cannon

Now
I
belong
to
this
last-named
class
;
and
*NL*
certainly
my
prospects
of
military
preferment
are
most
encouraging
as
*NL*
well
as
certain

My
fortune
,
though
small
,
is
free
and
unfettered

and
*NL*
the
memory
of
my
late

is
respected
in
our
country
,
Valentine
,
as
*NL*
that
of
the
most
upright
and
honorable
merchant
of
the
city

I
say
our
*NL*
country

because
you
were
born
not
far
from
Marseilles

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
speak

Marseilles

I
beg
of
you

Maximilian

that
one

*NL*
brings
back
my

to
my
recollection

my
angel
mother

who
died
too
*NL*
soon
for

all

now

Oh

if
my

were

still

there
would
be
nothing

the

Tell

truly

any
*NL*
ill-feeling
might

being
of

your

father
was
,
as
you
know
,
a
zealous
partisan
of
the
Bourbons
,
while
mine
*NL*
was
wholly
devoted
to
the
emperor

there
could
not
possibly
be
any
other
*NL*
difference
between
them

But
why
do
you
ask
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
tell
you

replied
the
young

,
``
for
it
is

right

Well

on
the
day
when
your
appointment
as
an

of
the
*NL*

of
honor
was
announced
in
the
papers
,
we
were
all
sitting
with
my

M.

there
also

you
recollect
M.

you
not

Maximilian

the
banker
,
whose
horses
ran
away
with
*NL*
my
mother-in-law

little
brother

very
nearly
killed
them

While
*NL*
the
rest
of
the
company
were
discussing
the
approaching
marriage
of
*NL*
Mademoiselle
Danglars
,
I
was
reading
the
paper
to
my
grandfather
;
but
*NL*
when
I
came
to
the
paragraph
about
you
,
although
I
had
done
nothing
else
*NL*
but
read
it
over
to
myself
all
the
morning
-LRB-
you
know
you
had
told
me
all
*NL*
about
it
the
previous
evening
-RRB-
,
I
felt
so
happy
,
and
yet
so
nervous
,
at
*NL*
the
idea
of
speaking
your
name
aloud
,
and
before
so
many
people
,
that
*NL*
I
really
think
I
should
have
passed
it
over
,
but
for
the
fear
that
my
*NL*
doing
so
might
create
suspicions
as
to
the
cause
of
my
silence
;
so
I
*NL*
summoned
up
all
my
courage
,
and
read
it
as
firmly
and
as
steadily
as
I
*NL*
could
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
would
you
believe
it

directly
my
father
caught
the
sound
of
your
*NL*
name

turned
round
quite
hastily
,
and
,
like
a
poor
silly
thing
,
I
was
*NL*
so
persuaded
that
every
one
must
be
as
much
affected
as
myself
by
the
*NL*
utterance
of
your

I
was
not
surprised
to
see
my

start

almost
tremble

I
even
thought

that
surely
must
have

knitting
his

brows
into
a
deep
frown

he
added
,
`
surely
this
can
not
be
one
of
the
*NL*
Morrel
family
who
lived
at
Marseilles

gave
us
so
much
trouble
from

violent
Bonapartism

I

about
the

`
Yes

M.

is
the

*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed

answered
Maximilian

*NL*
''
`
Ah
,
'
continued
my
father
,
still
frowning

`
their
idolized
emperor
*NL*
treated
these
madmen
as
they
deserved
;
he
called
them
`
food

was
precisely
all
they
were
good
for
;

I
am
delighted
to
see
*NL*
that
the
present
government
have
adopted
this
salutary
principle
with

all
its
pristine
vigor

if
Algiers
were
good
for
nothing

to
furnish
*NL*
the
means

carrying
so
admirable
an
idea
into
practice

it
would
be
*NL*
an
acquisition
well
worthy
of
struggling
to
obtain

Though
it
certainly
*NL*
does
cost
France
somewhat
dear
to
assert
her
rights
in
that
uncivilized
*NL*
country

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Brutal

I
must
confess

said
Maximilian

``
but
do
n't
attach

any
serious
importance

*NL*
not
a

said
he

You

that

for
picturesque
expression

generosity

there
is
not
much

to
choose
between

what
did

this
outburst

Oh
,
he
laughed
,
and
in
that
singular
manner
so
peculiar
to
*NL*
himself
--
half-malicious
,
half-ferocious
;
he
almost
immediately
got
up
*NL*
and
took
his
leave
;
then
,
for
the
first
time
,
I
observed
the
agitation
*NL*
of
my
grandfather

I
must
tell
you
,
Maximilian

that
I
am
the
only
*NL*
person
capable
of
discerning
emotion
in
his
paralyzed
frame
.
And
I
*NL*
suspected
that
the
conversation
that
had
been
carried
on
in
his
presence
*NL*
-LRB-
for
they
always
say

do
what
they
like
before
the
dear

*NL*
without
the
smallest
regard

his
feelings

had
made
a
strong

impression

mind

for
,
naturally
enough
,
it
must
have
pained
him
*NL*
to
hear
the
emperor

so
devotedly
loved

served
spoken
of
in
that

depreciating
manner

Maximilian

Oh

I
have
often
heard
whispers

things

me
most

strange

the
father
a
Bonapartist

the
son
a
Royalist

what
can
have
*NL*
been
the
reason
of
so
singular
a
difference
in
parties

politics

*NL*
But
to
resume
my
story
;
I
turned
towards
my
grandfather
,
as
though
to
*NL*
question
him
as
to
the
cause

his
emotion

he
looked
expressively

What
is
the
matter

dear
*NL*
grandfather

I

`
are
you
pleased

gave
me
a
sign
in

affirmative

`
With
what
my
father
said
just
now

He
returned
a
sign
in

Perhaps
you
liked

Another
sign
in

Oh
,
then

you
were
glad

hear
that
M.

did
n't
*NL*
dare
to
say
Maximilian
-RRB-
had
been
made
an
officer
of
the
Legion
of
*NL*
Honor
?
'
He
signified
assent
;
only
think
of
the
poor
old
man

being
so
*NL*
pleased
to
think
that
you

who
were
a
perfect
stranger
to
him

had
been

made
an
officer
of
the
Legion
of
Honor

Perhaps
it
was
a
mere
whim
on
*NL*
his
part
,
for
he
is
falling
,
they
say
,
into
second
childhood
,

I
love
*NL*
him
for
showing
so
much
interest
in
you

How
singular

murmured
Maximilian

``

leaped
at
one
bound
into

crop
of

he
began
to
pull
up

in
the
most
ruthless

being
occupied

weeding

it

an

on
the

side

the

to

Valentine

leaning
on

for

at

Madame

desired

Edward

made
all

not
from
obedience
to
his
mother

or
out
of
any
feeling

gratitude
to
the

from
sheer
curiosity

and
that
some
chance
*NL*
remark
might
give
him
the
opportunity
for
making
one
of
the
impertinent

speeches
which
made
his
mother
say

``
Oh

After
the

the

inquired
after

at
him
with
all
their
eyes
,
retired
*NL*
after
that
reasonable
delay
which
politeness
admits
and
curiosity
*NL*
requires
.
``
What
is
your
sister
Valentine
doing
?
''
inquired
Madame
de
*NL*
Villefort
of
Edward
;
``
tell
some
one
to
bid
her
come
here
,
that
I
may
*NL*
have
the
honor
of
introducing
her
to
the
count
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
a
daughter
,
then
,
madame
?
''
inquired
the
count
;
``
very
young
,
I
*NL*
presume
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
daughter
of
M.
de
Villefort
by
his
first
marriage
,
''
replied
the
*NL*
young
wife
,
``
a
fine
well-grown
girl
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
melancholy
,
''
interrupted
Master
Edward
,
snatching
the
feathers
out
*NL*
of
the
tail
of
a
splendid
parroquet
that
was
screaming
on
its
gilded
*NL*
perch
,
in
order
to
make
a
plume
for
his
hat
.
Madame
de
Villefort
merely
*NL*
cried
,
--
``
Be
still
,
Edward
!
''
She
then
added
,
--
``
This
young
madcap
is
,
*NL*
however
,
very
nearly
right
,
and
merely
re-echoes
what
he
has
heard
me
*NL*
say
with
pain
a
hundred
times
;
for
Mademoiselle
de
Villefort
is
,
in
*NL*
spite
of
all
we
can
do
to
rouse
her
,
of
a
melancholy
disposition
and
*NL*
taciturn
habit
,
which
frequently
injure
the
effect
of
her
beauty
.
But
*NL*
what
detains
her
?
Go
,
Edward
,
and
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
they
are
looking
for
her
where
she
is
not
to
be
found
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
where
are
they
looking
for
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
grandpapa
Noirtier
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
do
you
think
she
is
not
there

*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
no
,
no
,
no

she
is
not
there

''
replied
Edward
,
singing
his
*NL*
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
where
is
she
,
then
?
If
you
know
,
why
do
n't
you
tell
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
under
the
big
chestnut-tree
,
''
replied
the
spoiled
brat
,
as
he
*NL*
gave
,
in
spite
of
his
mother
's
commands
,
live
flies
to
the
parrot
,
which
*NL*
seemed
keenly
to
relish
such
fare
.
Madame
de
Villefort
stretched
out
her
*NL*
hand
to
ring
,
intending
to
direct
her
waiting-maid
to
the
spot
where
she
*NL*
would
find
Valentine
,
when
the
young
lady
herself
entered
the
*NL*
apartment
.
She
appeared
much
dejected
;
and
any
person
who
considered
her
*NL*
attentively
might
have
observed
the
traces
of
recent
tears
in
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Valentine
,
whom
we
have
in
the
rapid
march
of
our
narrative
presented
*NL*
to
our
readers
without
formally
introducing
her
,
was
a
tall
and
graceful
*NL*
girl
of
nineteen
,
with
bright
chestnut
hair
,
deep
blue
eyes
,
and
that
*NL*
reposeful
air
of
quiet
distinction
which
characterized
her
mother
.
*NL*
Her
white
and
slender
fingers
,
her
pearly
neck
,
her
cheeks
tinted
with
*NL*
varying
hues
reminded
one
of
the
lovely
Englishwomen
who
have
been
so
*NL*
poetically
compared
in
their
manner
to
the
gracefulness
of
a
swan
.
She
*NL*
entered
the
apartment
,
and
seeing
near
her
stepmother
the
stranger
of
*NL*
whom
she
had
already
heard
so
much
,
saluted
him
without
any
girlish
*NL*
awkwardness
,
or
even
lowering
her
eyes
,
and
with
an
elegance
that
*NL*
redoubled
the
count
's
attention
.
He
rose
to
return
the
salutation
.
*NL*
``
Mademoiselle
de
Villefort
,
my
daughter-in-law
,
''
said
Madame
de
*NL*
Villefort
to
Monte
Cristo
,
leaning
back
on
her
sofa
and
motioning
*NL*
towards
Valentine
with
her
hand
.
``
And
M.
de
Monte
Cristo
,
King
of
China
,
*NL*
Emperor
of
Cochin-China
,
''
said
the
young
imp
,
looking
slyly
towards
his
*NL*
sister
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Villefort
at
this
really
did
turn
pale
,
and
was
very
nearly
*NL*
angry
with
this
household
plague
,
who
answered
to
the
name
of
Edward
;
*NL*
but
the
count
,
on
the
contrary
,
smiled
,
and
appeared
to
look
at
the
boy
*NL*
complacently
,
which
caused
the
maternal
heart
to
bound
again
with
joy
*NL*
and
enthusiasm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
madame
,
''
replied
the
count
,
continuing
the
conversation
,
and
*NL*
looking
by
turns
at
Madame
de
Villefort
and
Valentine
,
``
have
I
not
*NL*
already
had
the
honor
of
meeting
yourself
and
mademoiselle
before
?
I
*NL*
could
not
help
thinking
so
just
now
;
the
idea
came
over
my
mind
,
and
*NL*
as
mademoiselle
entered
the
sight
of
her
was
an
additional
ray
of
light
*NL*
thrown
on
a
confused
remembrance
;
excuse
the
remark
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
think
it
likely
,
sir
;
Mademoiselle
de
Villefort
is
not
very
*NL*
fond
of
society
,
and
we
very
seldom
go
out
,
''
said
the
young
lady
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
it
was
not
in
society
that
I
met
with
mademoiselle
or
yourself
,
*NL*
madame
,
or
this
charming
little
merry
boy
.
Besides
,
the
Parisian
world
*NL*
is
entirely
unknown
to
me
,
for
,
as
I
believe
I
told
you
,
I
have
been
in
*NL*
Paris
but
very
few
days
.
No
,
--
but
,
perhaps
,
you
will
permit
me
to
call
*NL*
to
mind
--
stay
!
''
The
Count
placed
his
hand
on
his
brow
as
if
to
collect
*NL*
his
thoughts
.
``
No
--
it
was
somewhere
--
away
from
here
--
it
was
--
I
do
not
*NL*
know
--
but
it
appears
that
this
recollection
is
connected
with
a
lovely
*NL*
sky
and
some
religious
fete
;
mademoiselle
was
holding
flowers
in
her
*NL*
hand
,
the
interesting
boy
was
chasing
a
beautiful
peacock
in
a
garden
,
*NL*
and
you
,
madame
,
were
under
the
trellis
of
some
arbor
.
Pray
come
to
my
*NL*
aid
,
madame
;
do
not
these
circumstances
appeal
to
your
memory
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
indeed
,
''
replied
Madame
de
Villefort
;
``
and
yet
it
appears
to
me
,
*NL*
sir
,
that
if
I
had
met
you
anywhere
,
the
recollection
of
you
must
have
*NL*
been
imprinted
on
my
memory
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
the
count
saw
us
in
Italy

said
Valentine
timidly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
in
Italy
;
it
was
in
Italy
most
probably
,

replied
Monte
Cristo
;
*NL*
``
you
have
travelled
then
in
Italy
,
mademoiselle
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
madame

I
were
there
two
years
ago

The
doctors
,
anxious
for
*NL*
my
lungs

had
prescribed
the
air
of
Naples

We
went
by
Bologna

Perugia

*NL*

Rome

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
yes

true

mademoiselle

''
exclaimed
Monte
Cristo
as
if
this
simple
*NL*
explanation
was
sufficient
to
revive
the
recollection
he
sought
.
``
It
was
*NL*
at
Perugia
on
Corpus
Christi
Day
,
in
the
garden
of
the
Hotel
des
Postes

*NL*
when
chance
brought
us
together
;
you
,
Madame
de
Villefort
,
and
her
son
;
*NL*
I
now
remember
having
had
the
honor
of
meeting
you
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
perfectly

*NL*
the
festival
of
which
you
speak
,

said
Madame
de
Villefort
,
``
but
in
vain
*NL*
do
I
tax
my
memory

of
whose
treachery
I
am
ashamed

for
I
really
do
not
*NL*
recall
to
mind
that
I
ever
had
the
pleasure

seeing
you
before

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
strange

neither

observed
*NL*
Valentine
,
raising
her
beautiful
eyes
to
the
count
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
remember
it
perfectly

interposed
the
darling
Edward

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
assist
your
memory

continued
the
count
;
``
the
day
had

been
burning
hot
;
you
were
waiting
for
horses

which
were
delayed
in

consequence
of
the
festival
.
Mademoiselle
was
walking
in
the
shade
of
*NL*
the
garden
,

your
son
disappeared
in
pursuit
of
the
peacock

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
caught
it

mamma

do
n't
you
remember

interposed
Edward

I

pulled
three
such
beautiful
feathers
out

his
tail

you
were

stone
bench

while

as
I
told
you

Mademoiselle

de
Villefort

your
young

were
absent

you
conversed

considerable
time
with
somebody
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

in
truth
,
yes

answered
the
young
lady
,
turning
very
red
,
``
I
do
*NL*
remember
conversing
with
a
person
wrapped
in
a
long
woollen
mantle

he
*NL*
was
a
medical
man
,
I
think
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Precisely
so
,
madame

this
man
was
myself
;
for
a
fortnight
I
had
been
*NL*
at

during

period
I
had
cured
my
valet
de
chambre
of
*NL*
a
fever
,
and
my
landlord
of
the
jaundice
,
so
that
I
really
acquired
a
*NL*
reputation
as
a
skilful
physician

We
discoursed
a
long
time

madame

on
*NL*
different
subjects

of
Perugino

of
Raffaelle

of
manners

customs

of
*NL*
the
famous
aquatofana

of
which
they

told

Yes

somewhat
uneasily

I
remember

discoursed

continued
the
count
with
perfect
calmness
;
``

I
perfectly
*NL*
remember
that

falling
into
the
error
which
others
had
entertained
*NL*
respecting
me

you
consulted
me
as
to
the
health
of
Mademoiselle

Villefort

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

Villefort

Moliere

At

the

struck
six

saluting

left

By
no

the
young

quickly

closed

not

to

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
True
,
sir

The
two
favorite
studies
of
my
youth
were
botany
and
*NL*
mineralogy
,
and
subsequently
,
when
I
learned
that
the
use
of
simples
*NL*
frequently
explained
the
whole
history
of
a
people
,
and
the
entire
life
*NL*
of
individuals
in
the
East
,
as
flowers
betoken
and
symbolize
a
love
*NL*
affair
,
I
have
regretted
that
I
was
not
a
man
,
that
I
might
have
been
a
*NL*
Flamel
,
a
Fontana
,
or
a
Cabanis

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
the
more
,
madame

''
said
Monte

,
``
as
the
Orientals
do
not
*NL*
confine
themselves
,
as
did
Mithridates
,
to
make
a
cuirass
of
his
*NL*
poisons
,
but
they
also
made
them
a
dagger
.
Science
becomes
,
in
their
*NL*
hands
,
not
only
a
defensive
weapon
,
but
still
more
frequently
an
*NL*
offensive
one
;
the
one
serves
against
all
their
physical
sufferings

*NL*
the
other
against
all
their
enemies

With
opium

belladonna

snake-wood

they
put
to
sleep
all

There

not
one

Egyptian

Turkish

Greek
,
whom
here
you
call

do
not

how

stupefy

amaze
a

*NL*
*NL*
``
Really

said
Madame

eyes
sparkled
with
strange

fire
at
this
conversation

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

yes

madame

continued
Monte

,
``
the
secret

with
paradise

and
I
will
say
further
--
the
art
of
these
chemists
*NL*
is
capable
with
the
utmost
precision
to
accommodate
and
proportion
the
*NL*

the

yearnings

desires

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,

``
these

A

easily
be
put
out

The

really
Haroun-al-Raschids

not

pardon

even
make
him

under
such
circumstances

the
whole

story
written

divert
their
hours

idleness

ennui

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
no

madame

the
fanciful
exists
no
longer
in
the
East

There
,
*NL*
disguised
under
other
names
,
and
concealed
under
other
costumes
,
are
*NL*
police
agents
,
magistrates
,
attorneys-general
,
and
bailiffs

They
*NL*
hang

behead

and
impale
their
criminals
in
the
most
agreeable
possible

manner
;
but
some
of
these
,
like
clever
rogues
,
have
contrived
to
escape
*NL*
human
justice
,
and
succeed
in
their
fraudulent
enterprises
by
cunning
*NL*
stratagems
.
Amongst
us
a
simpleton
,
possessed
by
the
demon
of
hate
or
*NL*
cupidity
,
who
has
an
enemy
to
destroy
,
or
some
near
relation
to
dispose
*NL*
of
,
goes
straight
to
the
grocer
's
or
druggist
's
,
gives
a
false
name
,
*NL*
which
leads
more
easily
to
his
detection
than
his
real
one
,
and
under
*NL*
the
pretext
that
the
rats
prevent
him
from
sleeping
,
purchases
five
or
*NL*
six
grammes
of
arsenic
--
if
he
is
really
a
cunning
fellow
,
he
goes
to
*NL*
five
or
six
different
druggists
or
grocers
,
and
thereby
becomes
only
*NL*
five
or
six
times
more
easily
traced
;
--
then
,
when
he
has
acquired
his
*NL*
specific
,
he
administers
duly
to
his
enemy
,
or
near
kinsman
,
a
dose
of
*NL*
arsenic
which
would
make
a
mammoth
or
mastodon
burst
,
and
which
,
without
*NL*
rhyme
or
reason
,
makes
his
victim
utter
groans
which
alarm
the
entire
*NL*
neighborhood
.
Then
arrive
a
crowd
of
policemen
and
constables
.
They
*NL*
fetch
a
doctor
,
who
opens
the
dead
body
,
and
collects
from
the
entrails
*NL*
and
stomach
a
quantity
of
arsenic
in
a
spoon
.
Next
day
a
hundred
*NL*
newspapers
relate
the
fact

with
the
names
of
the
victim

the

The

evening
the

come

rather

not

they

twenty

if

they
lock

confess

more
skilful

*NL*
*NL*
``
What

said
the

laughing
;

shall
I
tell

by
what

at

I
could
judge
by
reading
the
pieces

swallow
the
contents
of

phial

suck
the
button

*NL*
fall
dead
instantly

Five
minutes
afterwards
the
curtain
falls
,
and
the
*NL*
spectators
depart

They
are
ignorant

the
consequences

they
see
neither
the

badge
of
office

corporal
with
his
four
men

and
so
the
poor
fools
believe
that
the
whole

is
as
easy
as
lying

But
go
a
little
way
from
France

go
either

to
Aleppo

Cairo

only
to
Naples

Rome

you
will
see
people

passing
by
you

people
erect

fresh-colored

Asmodeus

``
Then

remarked
Madame
de
Villefort
,
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

take
a
different

not
follow
them

there

some

thought

I

*NL*
``
Yes

no

*NL*
``
So
,
''
added
Madame
de
Villefort
,
constantly
returning
to
her
object
,
*NL*
``
the
poisons
of
the
Borgias
,
the
Medicis
,
the
Renes
,
the
Ruggieris
,
*NL*
and
later
,
probably
,
that
of
Baron
de
Trenck
,
whose
story
has
been
so
*NL*
misused
by

--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Were

madame

nothing
more

''
replied
the
count
.
``
Do
*NL*
you
suppose
that
the
real
savant
addresses
himself
stupidly
to
the
mere
*NL*
individual
?
By
no
means
.
Science
loves
eccentricities
,
leaps
and
bounds
,
*NL*
trials
of
strength
,
fancies
,
if
I
may
be
allowed
so
to
term
them
.
Thus
,
*NL*
for
instance
,
the
excellent
Abbe
Adelmonte
,
of
whom
I
spoke
just
now
,
*NL*
made
in
this
way
some
marvellous
experiments
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
I
will
mention
one
to
you
.
He
had
a
remarkably
fine
garden
,
full
*NL*
of
vegetables
,
flowers
,
and
fruit
.
From
amongst
these
vegetables
he
*NL*
selected
the
most
simple
--
a
cabbage
,
for
instance
.
For
three
days
he
*NL*
watered
this
cabbage
with
a
distillation
of
arsenic
;
on
the
third
,
the
*NL*
cabbage
began
to
droop
and
turn
yellow
.
At
that
moment
he
cut
it
.
In
the
*NL*
eyes
of
everybody
it
seemed
fit
for
table
,
and
preserved
its
wholesome
*NL*
appearance
.
It
was
only
poisoned
to
the
Abbe
Adelmonte
.
He
then
took
the
*NL*
cabbage
to
the
room
where
he
had
rabbits
--
for
the
Abbe
Adelmonte
had
*NL*
a
collection
of
rabbits
,
cats
,
and
guinea-pigs
,
fully
as
fine
as
his
*NL*
collection
of
vegetables
,
flowers
,
and
fruit
.
Well
,
the
Abbe
Adelmonte
*NL*
took
a
rabbit
,
and
made
it
eat
a
leaf
of
the
cabbage
.
The
rabbit
died
.
*NL*
What
magistrate
would
find
,
or
even
venture
to
insinuate
,
anything
*NL*
against
this
?
What
procureur
has
ever
ventured
to
draw
up
an
accusation
*NL*
against
M.
Magendie
or
M.
Flourens
,
in
consequence
of
the
rabbits
,
cats
,
*NL*
and
guinea-pigs
they
have
killed
?
--
not
one
.
So
,
then
,
the
rabbit
dies
,
*NL*
and
justice
takes
no
notice
.
This
rabbit
dead
,
the
Abbe
Adelmonte
has
*NL*
its
entrails
taken
out
by
his
cook
and
thrown
on
the
dunghill
;
on
this
*NL*
dunghill
is
a
hen
,
who
,
pecking
these
intestines
,
is
in
her
turn
taken
*NL*
ill
,
and
dies
next
day
.
At
the
moment
when
she
is
struggling
in
the
*NL*
convulsions
of
death
,
a
vulture
is
flying
by
-LRB-
there
are
a
good
many
*NL*
vultures
in
Adelmonte
's
country
-RRB-
;
this
bird
darts
on
the
dead
fowl
,
*NL*
and
carries
it
away
to
a
rock
,
where
it
dines
off
its
prey
.
Three
days
*NL*
afterwards
,
this
poor
vulture
,
which
has
been
very
much
indisposed
since
*NL*
that
dinner
,
suddenly
feels
very
giddy
while
flying
aloft
in
the
*NL*
clouds
,
and
falls
heavily
into
a
fish-pond
.
The
pike
,
eels
,
and
carp
eat
*NL*
greedily
always
,
as
everybody
knows
--
well
,
they
feast
on
the
vulture
.
*NL*
Now
suppose
that
next
day
,
one
of
these
eels
,
or
pike
,
or
carp
,
poisoned
*NL*
at
the
fourth
remove
,
is
served
up
at
your
table
.
Well
,
then
,
your
guest
*NL*
will
be
poisoned
at
the
fifth
remove
,
and
die
,
at
the
end
of
eight
*NL*
or
ten
days
,
of
pains
in
the
intestines
,
sickness
,
or
abscess
of
the
*NL*
pylorus
.
The
doctors
open
the
body
and
say
with
an
air
of
profound
*NL*
learning
,
`
The
subject
has
died
of
a
tumor
on
the
liver
,
or
of
typhoid
*NL*
fever
!
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
''
remarked
Madame
de
Villefort
,
``
all
these
circumstances
which
*NL*
you
link
thus
to
one
another
may
be
broken
by
the
least
accident
;
the
*NL*
vulture
may
not
see
the
fowl
,
or
may
fall
a
hundred
yards
from
the
*NL*
fish-pond
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
that
is
where
the
art
comes
in

To
be
a
great
chemist
in
the
*NL*
East
,
one
must
direct
chance
;
and
this
is
to
be
achieved
.
''
--
Madame
de
*NL*
Villefort
was
in
deep
thought
,
yet
listened
attentively
.
``
But
,
''
*NL*
she
exclaimed
,
suddenly
,
``
arsenic
is
indelible
,
indestructible
;
in
*NL*
whatsoever
way
it
is
absorbed
,
it
will
be
found
again
in
the
body
of
the
*NL*
victim
from
the
moment
when
it
has
been
taken
in
sufficient
quantity
to
*NL*
cause
death
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Precisely
so
,
''
cried
Monte
Cristo
--
``
precisely
so
;
and
this
is
what
I
*NL*
said
to
my
worthy
Adelmonte
.
He
reflected
,
smiled
,
and
replied
to
me
by
*NL*
a
Sicilian
proverb
,
which
I
believe
is
also
a
French
proverb
,
`
My
son
,
*NL*
the
world
was
not
made
in
a
day
--
but
in
seven
.
Return
on
Sunday
.
'
On
*NL*
the
Sunday
following
I
did
return
to
him
.
Instead
of
having
watered
his
*NL*
cabbage
with
arsenic
,
he
had
watered
it
this
time
with
a
solution
of
*NL*
salts
,
having
their
basis
in
strychnine
,
strychnos
colubrina
,
as
the
*NL*
learned
term
it
.
Now
,
the
cabbage
had
not
the
slightest
appearance
of
*NL*
disease
in
the
world
,
and
the
rabbit
had
not
the
smallest
distrust
;
yet
,
*NL*
five
minutes
afterwards
,
the
rabbit
was
dead
.
The
fowl
pecked
at
the
*NL*
rabbit
,
and
the
next
day
was
a
dead
hen
.
This
time
we
were
the
*NL*
vultures
;
so
we
opened
the
bird
,
and
this
time
all
special
symptoms
had
*NL*
disappeared
,
there
were
only
general
symptoms
.
There
was
no
peculiar
*NL*
indication
in
any
organ
--
an
excitement
of
the
nervous
system
--
that
was
*NL*
it
;
a
case
of
cerebral
congestion
--
nothing
more
.
The
fowl
had
not
been
*NL*
poisoned
--
she
had
died
of
apoplexy
.
Apoplexy
is
a
rare
disease
among
*NL*
fowls
,
I
believe
,
but
very
common
among
men
.
''
Madame
de
Villefort
*NL*
appeared
more
and
more
thoughtful
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
very
fortunate
,
''
she
observed
,
``
that
such
substances
could
only
*NL*
be
prepared
by
chemists
;
otherwise
,
all
the
world
would
be
poisoning
*NL*
each
other
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
chemists
and
persons
who
have
a
taste
for
chemistry
,
''
said
Monte
*NL*
Cristo
carelessly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
then
,
''
said
Madame
de
Villefort
,
endeavoring
by
a
struggle
,
and
*NL*
with
effort
,
to
get
away
from
her
thoughts
,
``
however
skilfully
it
is
*NL*
prepared
,
crime
is
always
crime
,
and
if
it
avoid
human
scrutiny
,
it
does
*NL*
not
escape
the
eye
of
God
.
The
Orientals
are
stronger
than
we
are
in
*NL*
cases
of
conscience
,
and
,
very
prudently
,
have
no
hell
--
that
is
the
*NL*
point
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
,
madame
,
this
is
a
scruple
which
naturally
must
occur
to
a
pure
*NL*
mind
like
yours
,
but
which
would
easily
yield
before
sound
reasoning
.
*NL*
The
bad
side
of
human
thought
will
always
be
defined
by
the
paradox
of
*NL*
Jean
Jacques
Rousseau
,
--
you
remember
,
--
the
mandarin
who
is
killed
five
*NL*
hundred
leagues
off
by
raising
the
tip
of
the
finger
.
Man
's
whole
*NL*
life
passes
in
doing
these
things
,
and
his
intellect
is
exhausted
by
*NL*
reflecting
on
them
.
You
will
find
very
few
persons
who
will
go
and
*NL*
brutally
thrust
a
knife
in
the
heart
of
a
fellow-creature
,
or
will
*NL*
administer
to
him
,
in
order
to
remove
him
from
the
surface
of
the
globe
*NL*
on
which
we
move
with
life
and
animation
,
that
quantity
of
arsenic
of
*NL*
which
we
just
now
talked
.
Such
a
thing
is
really
out
of
rule
--
eccentric
*NL*
or
stupid
.
To
attain
such
a
point
,
the
blood
must
be
heated
to
*NL*
thirty-six
degrees
,
the
pulse
be
,
at
least
,
at
ninety
,
and
the
*NL*
feelings
excited
beyond
the
ordinary
limit
.
But
suppose
one
pass
,
as
is
*NL*
permissible
in
philology
,
from
the
word
itself
to
its
softened
synonym
,
*NL*
then
,
instead
of
committing
an
ignoble
assassination
you
make
an
*NL*
`
elimination
;
'
you
merely
and
simply
remove
from
your
path
the
*NL*
individual
who
is
in
your
way
,
and
that
without
shock
or
violence
,
*NL*
without
the
display
of
the
sufferings
which
,
in
the
case
of
becoming
a
*NL*
punishment
,
make
a
martyr
of
the
victim
,
and
a
butcher
,
in
every
sense
*NL*
of
the
word
,
of
him
who
inflicts
them
.
Then
there
will
be
no
blood
,
no
*NL*
groans
,
no
convulsions
,
and
above
all
,
no
consciousness
of
that
horrid
*NL*
and
compromising
moment
of
accomplishing
the
act
,
--
then
one
escapes
the
*NL*
clutch
of
the
human
law
,
which
says
,
`
Do
not
disturb
society
!
'
This
*NL*
is
the
mode
in
which
they
manage
these
things
,
and
succeed
in
Eastern
*NL*
climes
,
where
there
are
grave
and
phlegmatic
persons
who
care
very
*NL*
little
for
the
questions
of
time
in
conjunctures
of
importance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yet
conscience
remains
,
''
remarked
Madame
de
Villefort
in
an
agitated
*NL*
voice
,
and
with
a
stifled
sigh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
answered
Monte
Cristo
``
happily
,
yes
,
conscience
does
remain
;
and
*NL*
if
it
did
not
,
how
wretched
we
should
be
!
After
every
action
requiring
*NL*
exertion
,
it
is
conscience
that
saves
us
,
for
it
supplies
us
with
a
*NL*
thousand
good
excuses
,
of
which
we
alone
are
judges
;
and
these
reasons
,
*NL*
howsoever
excellent
in
producing
sleep
,
would
avail
us
but
very
little
*NL*
before
a
tribunal
,
when
we
were
tried
for
our
lives
.
Thus
Richard
*NL*
III.
,
for
instance
,
was
marvellously
served
by
his
conscience
after
the
*NL*
putting
away
of
the
two
children
of
Edward
IV.
;
in
fact
,
he
could
say
,
*NL*
`
These
two
children
of
a
cruel
and
persecuting
king
,
who
have
inherited
*NL*
the
vices
of
their
father
,
which
I
alone
could
perceive
in
their
*NL*
juvenile
propensities
--
these
two
children
are
impediments
in
my
way
of
*NL*
promoting
the
happiness
of
the
English
people
,
whose
unhappiness
they
*NL*
-LRB-
the
children
-RRB-
would
infallibly
have
caused
.
'
Thus
was
Lady
Macbeth
*NL*
served
by
her
conscience
,
when
she
sought
to
give
her
son
,
and
not
her
*NL*
husband
-LRB-
whatever
Shakespeare
may
say
-RRB-
,
a
throne
.
Ah
,
maternal
love
is
a
*NL*
great
virtue
,
a
powerful
motive
--
so
powerful
that
it
excuses
a
multitude
*NL*
of
things
,
even
if
,
after
Duncan
's
death
,
Lady
Macbeth
had
been
at
all
*NL*
pricked
by
her
conscience
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Villefort
listened
with
avidity
to
these
appalling
maxims
and
*NL*
horrible
paradoxes
,
delivered
by
the
count
with
that
ironical
simplicity
*NL*
which
was
peculiar
to
him
.
After
a
moment
's
silence
,
the
lady
inquired
,
*NL*
``
Do
you
know

''
she
said
,
``

Have

really
measured
the

by
scrutinies

or
through

For
you
must
indeed
be
a
great

the

elixir
you
administered

one
drop

recall
life

three
drops

have

impelled
the
blood
into
his
lungs
in
such
a
way

to
have
produced

most
violent
palpitations

six
would

suspended

caused
syncope
more
serious

ten

destroyed
him

You

suddenly
I
snatched
him
from

phials

imprudently

terrible

``

no

In

us
agree
that

use

tranquillizing
my

I
must
continue
to
use
Monsieur
Planche
's
*NL*
anti-spasmodics
;
and
mint
and
Hoffman
's
drops
are
among
my
favorite
*NL*
remedies
.
Here
are
some
lozenges
which
I
have
made
up
on
purpose
;
they
*NL*
are
compounded
doubly
strong

''
Monte
Cristo
opened
the
tortoise-shell
*NL*
box
,
which
the
lady
presented
to
him
,
and
inhaled
the
odor
of
the
*NL*
lozenges
with
the
air
of
an
amateur
who
thoroughly
appreciated
their
*NL*
composition
.
``
They
are
indeed
exquisite
,
''
he
said
;
``
but
as
they
are
*NL*
necessarily
submitted
to
the
process
of
deglutition
--
a
function
which
it
*NL*
is
frequently
impossible
for
a
fainting
person
to
accomplish

I
prefer
*NL*
my
own
specific
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Undoubtedly
,
and
so
should
I
prefer
it
,
after
the
effects
I
have
seen
*NL*
produced
;
but
of
course
it
is
a
secret
,
and
I
am
not
so
indiscreet
as
to
*NL*
ask
it
of
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I

said
Monte

,
rising
as
he
spoke
--
``
I
am
gallant
enough

offer
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
How
kind
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
remember
one
thing

a

a

poison

One
drop
will
restore
life

as
you
have
seen

five

six

*NL*
inevitably
kill

in

the

not

I

no

it
is
really
as

The
clock
struck
half-past
six
,
and
a
lady
was
announced
,
a
friend
*NL*
of
Madame

came

Monte

Monte

bowed
,
*NL*
and
left
the
house

Madame

remained
immersed
in
thought

*NL*
``

the

had
surpassed

The
pretext
of
an
opera
engagement
was
so
much
the
more
feasible
,
as
*NL*
there
chanced
to
be
on
that
very
night
a
more
than
ordinary
attraction
*NL*
at
the
Academie
Royale
.
Levasseur
,
who
had
been
suffering
under
severe
*NL*
illness
,
made
his
reappearance
in
the
character
of
Bertrand
,
and
,
as
*NL*
usual
,
the
announcement
of
the
most
admired
production
of
the
favorite
*NL*
composer
of
the
day
had
attracted
a
brilliant
and
fashionable
audience
.
*NL*
Morcerf
,
like
most
other
young
men
of
rank
and
fortune
,
had
his
*NL*
orchestra
stall
,
with
the
certainty
of
always
finding
a
seat
in
at
least
*NL*
a
dozen
of
the
principal
boxes
occupied
by
persons
of
his
acquaintance
;
*NL*
he
had
,
moreover
,
his
right
of
entry
into
the
omnibus
box
.
*NL*
Chateau-Renaud
rented
a
stall
beside
his
own
,
while
Beauchamp
,
as
a
*NL*
journalist
,
had
unlimited
range
all
over
the
theatre
.
It
happened
that
*NL*
on
this
particular
night
the
minister
's
box
was
placed
at
the
disposal
*NL*
of
Lucien
Debray
,
who
offered
it
to
the
Comte
de
Morcerf
,
who
again
,
*NL*
upon
his
mother
's
rejection
of
it
,
sent
it
to
Danglars
,
with
an
*NL*
intimation
that
he
should
probably
do
himself
the
honor
of
joining
the
*NL*
baroness
and
her
daughter
during
the
evening
,
in
the
event
of
their
*NL*
accepting
the
box
in
question
.
The
ladies
received
the
offer
with
too
*NL*
much
pleasure
to
dream
of
a
refusal
.
To
no
class
of
persons
is
the
*NL*
presentation
of
a
gratuitous
opera-box
more
acceptable
than
to
the
*NL*
wealthy
millionaire
,
who
still
hugs
economy
while
boasting
of
carrying
a
*NL*
king
's
ransom
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
.
*NL*
*NL*
Danglars
had
,
however
,
protested
against
showing
himself
in
a
*NL*
ministerial
box
,
declaring
that
his
political
principles
,
and
his
*NL*
parliamentary
position
as
member
of
the
opposition
party
would
not
*NL*
permit
him
so
to
commit
himself
;
the
baroness
had
,
therefore
,
despatched
*NL*
a
note
to
Lucien
Debray
,
bidding
him
call
for
them
,
it
being
wholly
*NL*
impossible
for
her
to
go
alone
with
Eugenie
to
the
opera
.
There
is
no
*NL*
gainsaying
the
fact
that
a
very
unfavorable
construction
would
have
*NL*
been
put
upon
the
circumstance
if
the
two
women
had
gone
without
escort
,
*NL*
while
the
addition
of
a
third
,
in
the
person
of
her
mother
's
admitted
*NL*
lover
,
enabled
Mademoiselle
Danglars
to
defy
malice
and
ill-nature
.
One
*NL*
must
take
the
world
as
one
finds
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
curtain
rose
,
as
usual
,
to
an
almost
empty
house
,
it
being
one
of
*NL*
the
absurdities
of
Parisian
fashion
never
to
appear
at
the
opera
*NL*
until
after
the
beginning
of
the
performance
,
so
that
the
first
act
is
*NL*
generally
played
without
the
slightest
attention
being
paid
to
it
,
*NL*
that
part
of
the
audience
already
assembled
being
too
much
occupied
in
*NL*
observing
the
fresh
arrivals
,
while
nothing
is
heard
but
the
noise
of
*NL*
opening
and
shutting
doors
,
and
the
buzz
of
conversation
.
``
Surely
,
''
said
*NL*
Albert
,
as
the
door
of
a
box
on
the
first
circle
opened
,
``
that
must
be
*NL*
the
Countess
G
--
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
who
is
the
Countess
G
--
?
''
inquired
Chateau-Renaud
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
question
!
Now
,
do
you
know
,
baron
,
I
have
a
great
mind
to
pick
a
*NL*
quarrel
with
you
for
asking
it
;
as
if
all
the
world
did
not
know
who
the
*NL*
Countess
G
--
was
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
to
be
sure
,
''
replied
Chateau-Renaud
;
``
the
lovely
Venetian
,
is
it
*NL*
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Herself
.
''
At
this
moment
the
countess
perceived
Albert
,
and
*NL*
returned
his
salutation
with
a
smile
.
``
You
know
her
,
it
seems
?
''
said
*NL*
Chateau-Renaud
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Franz
introduced
me
to
her
at
Rome
,
''
replied
Albert
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
will
you
do
as
much
for
me
in
Paris
as
Franz
did
for
you
in
*NL*
Rome
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
pleasure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
cry
of
``
Shut
up
!
''
from
the
audience
.
This
manifestation
*NL*
on
the
part
of
the
spectators
of
their
wish
to
be
allowed
to
hear
the
*NL*
music
,
produced
not
the
slightest
effect
on
the
two
young
men
,
who
*NL*
continued
their
conversation
.
``
The
countess
was
present
at
the
races
in
*NL*
the
Champ-de-Mars
,
''
said
Chateau-Renaud
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To-day
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bless
me
,
I
quite
forgot
the
races
.
Did
you
bet
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
merely
a
paltry
fifty
louis
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
who
was
the
winner
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nautilus
.
I
staked
on
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
there
were
three
races
,
were
there
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
there
was
the
prize
given
by
the
Jockey
Club
--
a
gold
cup
,
you
*NL*
know
--
and
a
very
singular
circumstance
occurred
about
that
race
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
was
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
shut
up
!
''
again
interposed
some
of
the
audience
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
it
was
won
by
a
horse
and
rider
utterly
unknown
on
the
course
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
possible
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
True
as
day
.
The
fact
was
,
nobody
had
observed
a
horse
entered
by
the
*NL*
name
of
Vampa
,
or
that
of
a
jockey
styled
Job
,
when
,
at
the
last
*NL*
moment
,
a
splendid
roan
,
mounted
by
a
jockey
about
as
big
as
your
fist
,
*NL*
presented
themselves
at
the
starting-post
.
They
were
obliged
to
stuff
at
*NL*
least
twenty
pounds
weight
of
shot
in
the
small
rider
's
pockets
,
to
make
*NL*
him
weight
;
but
with
all
that
he
outstripped
Ariel
and
Barbare
,
against
*NL*
whom
he
ran
,
by
at
least
three
whole
lengths
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
was
it
not
found
out
at
last
to
whom
the
horse
and
jockey
*NL*
belonged
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
say
that
the
horse
was
entered
under
the
name
of
Vampa
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Exactly
;
that
was
the
title
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
''
answered
Albert
,
``
I
am
better
informed
than
you
are
,
and
know
*NL*
who
the
owner
of
that
horse
was
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shut
up
,
there
!
''
cried
the
pit
in
chorus
.
And
this
time
the
tone
and
*NL*
manner
in
which
the
command
was
given
,
betokened
such
growing
hostility
*NL*
that
the
two
young
men
perceived
,
for
the
first
time
,
that
the
mandate
*NL*
was
addressed
to
them
.
Leisurely
turning
round
,
they
calmly
scrutinized
*NL*
the
various
countenances
around
them
,
as
though
demanding
some
one
*NL*
person
who
would
take
upon
himself
the
responsibility
of
what
they
*NL*
deemed
excessive
impertinence
;
but
as
no
one
responded
to
the
challenge
,
*NL*
the
friends
turned
again
to
the
front
of
the
theatre
,
and
affected
*NL*
to
busy
themselves
with
the
stage
.
At
this
moment
the
door
of
the
*NL*
minister
's
box
opened
,
and
Madame
Danglars
,
accompanied
by
her
daughter
,
*NL*
entered
,
escorted
by
Lucien
Debray
,
who
assiduously
conducted
them
to
*NL*
their
seats
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ha
,
ha
,
''
said
Chateau-Renaud
,
``
here
comes
some
friends
of
yours
,
*NL*
viscount
!
What
are
you
looking
at
there
?
do
n't
you
see
they
are
trying
*NL*
to
catch
your
eye
?
''
Albert
turned
round
,
just
in
time
to
receive
a
*NL*
gracious
wave
of
the
fan
from
the
baroness
;
as
for
Mademoiselle
Eugenie
,
*NL*
she
scarcely
vouchsafed
to
waste
the
glances
of
her
large
black
eyes
*NL*
even
upon
the
business
of
the
stage
.
``
I
tell
you
what
,
my
dear
fellow
,
''
*NL*
said
Chateau-Renaud
,
``
I
can
not
imagine
what
objection
you
can
possibly
*NL*
have
to
Mademoiselle
Danglars
--
that
is
,
setting
aside
her
want
of
*NL*
ancestry
and
somewhat
inferior
rank
,
which
by
the
way
I
do
n't
think
*NL*
you
care
very
much
about
.
Now
,
barring
all
that
,
I
mean
to
say
she
is
a
*NL*
deuced
fine
girl
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Handsome
,
certainly
,
''
replied
Albert
,
``
but
not
to
my
taste
,
which
I
*NL*
confess
,
inclines
to
something
softer
,
gentler
,
and
more
feminine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
well
,
''
exclaimed
Chateau-Renaud
,
who
because
he
had
seen
his
*NL*
thirtieth
summer
fancied
himself
duly
warranted
in
assuming
a
sort
of
*NL*
paternal
air
with
his
more
youthful
friend
,
``
you
young
people
are
never
*NL*
satisfied
;
why
,
what
would
you
have
more
?
your
parents
have
chosen
you
*NL*
a
bride
built
on
the
model
of
Diana
,
the
huntress
,
and
yet
you
are
not
*NL*
content
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
for
that
very
resemblance
affrights
me
;
I
should
have
liked
*NL*
something
more
in
the
manner
of
the
Venus
of
Milo
or
Capua
;
but
this
*NL*
chase-loving
Diana
continually
surrounded
by
her
nymphs
gives
me
a
sort
*NL*
of
alarm
lest
she
should
some
day
bring
on
me
the
fate
of
Actaeon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
indeed
,
it
required
but
one
glance
at
Mademoiselle
Danglars
to
*NL*
comprehend
the
justness
of
Morcerf
's
remark
--
she
was
beautiful
,
but
her
*NL*
beauty
was
of
too
marked
and
decided
a
character
to
please
a
fastidious
*NL*
taste
;
her
hair
was
raven
black
,
but
its
natural
waves
seemed
somewhat
*NL*
rebellious
;
her
eyes
,
of
the
same
color
as
her
hair
,
were
surmounted
by
*NL*
well-arched
brows
,
whose
great
defect
,
however
,
consisted
in
an
almost
*NL*
habitual
frown
,
while
her
whole
physiognomy
wore
that
expression
*NL*
of
firmness
and
decision
so
little
in
accordance
with
the
gentler
*NL*
attributes
of
her
sex
--
her
nose
was
precisely
what
a
sculptor
would
*NL*
have
chosen
for
a
chiselled
Juno
.
Her
mouth
,
which
might
have
been
found
*NL*
fault
with
as
too
large
,
displayed
teeth
of
pearly
whiteness
,
rendered
*NL*
still
more
conspicuous
by
the
brilliant
carmine
of
her
lips
,
contrasting
*NL*
vividly
with
her
naturally
pale
complexion
.
But
that
which
completed
the
*NL*
almost
masculine
look
Morcerf
found
so
little
to
his
taste
,
was
a
dark
*NL*
mole
,
of
much
larger
dimensions
than
these
freaks
of
nature
generally
*NL*
are
,
placed
just
at
the
corner
of
her
mouth
;
and
the
effect
tended
*NL*
to
increase
the
expression
of
self-dependence
that
characterized
her
*NL*
countenance
.
The
rest
of
Mademoiselle
Eugenie
's
person
was
in
perfect
*NL*
keeping
with
the
head
just
described
;
she
,
indeed
,
reminded
one
of
*NL*
Diana
,
as
Chateau-Renaud
observed
,
but
her
bearing
was
more
haughty
and
*NL*
resolute
.
As
regarded
her
attainments
,
the
only
fault
to
be
found
with
*NL*
them
was
the
same
that
a
fastidious
connoisseur
might
have
found
with
*NL*
her
beauty
,
that
they
were
somewhat
too
erudite
and
masculine
for
so
*NL*
young
a
person
.
She
was
a
perfect
linguist
,
a
first-rate
artist
,
wrote
*NL*
poetry
,
and
composed
music
;
to
the
study
of
the
latter
she
professed
to
*NL*
be
entirely
devoted
,
following
it
with
an
indefatigable
perseverance
,
*NL*
assisted
by
a
schoolfellow
,
--
a
young
woman
without
fortune
whose
talent
*NL*
promised
to
develop
into
remarkable
powers
as
a
singer
.
It
was
rumored
*NL*
that
she
was
an
object
of
almost
paternal
interest
to
one
of
the
*NL*
principal
composers
of
the
day
,
who
excited
her
to
spare
no
pains
in
the
*NL*
cultivation
of
her
voice
,
which
might
hereafter
prove
a
source
of
wealth
*NL*
and
independence
.
But
this
counsel
effectually
decided
Mademoiselle
*NL*
Danglars
never
to
commit
herself
by
being
seen
in
public
with
one
*NL*
destined
for
a
theatrical
life
;
and
acting
upon
this
principle
,
the
*NL*
banker
's
daughter
,
though
perfectly
willing
to
allow
Mademoiselle
Louise
*NL*
d'Armilly
-LRB-
that
was
the
name
of
the
young
virtuosa
-RRB-
to
practice
with
*NL*
her
through
the
day
,
took
especial
care
not
to
be
seen
in
her
company
.
*NL*
Still
,
though
not
actually
received
at
the
Hotel
Danglars
in
the
light
*NL*
of
an
acknowledged
friend
,
Louise
was
treated
with
far
more
kindness
and
*NL*
consideration
than
is
usually
bestowed
on
a
governess
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
curtain
fell
almost
immediately
after
the
entrance
of
Madame
*NL*
Danglars
into
her
box
,
the
band
quitted
the
orchestra
for
the
accustomed
*NL*
half-hour
's
interval
allowed
between
the
acts
,
and
the
audience
were
*NL*
left
at
liberty
to
promenade
the
salon
or
lobbies
,
or
to
pay
and
receive
*NL*
visits
in
their
respective
boxes
.
Morcerf
and
Chateau-Renaud
were
*NL*
amongst
the
first
to
avail
themselves
of
this
permission
.
For
an
instant
*NL*
the
idea
struck
Madame
Danglars
that
this
eagerness
on
the
part
of
the
*NL*
young
viscount
arose
from
his
impatience
to
join
her
party
,
and
she
*NL*
whispered
her
expectations
to
her
daughter
,
that
Albert
was
hurrying
to
*NL*
pay
his
respects
to
them
.
Mademoiselle
Eugenie
,
however
,
merely
returned
*NL*
a
dissenting
movement
of
the
head
,
while
,
with
a
cold
smile
,
she
*NL*
directed
the
attention
of
her
mother
to
an
opposite
box
on
the
first
*NL*
circle
,
in
which
sat
the
Countess
G
--
,
and
where
Morcerf
had
just
made
*NL*
his
appearance
.
``
So
we
meet
again
,
my
travelling
friend
,
do
we
?
''
*NL*
cried
the
countess
,
extending
her
hand
to
him
with
all
the
warmth
and
*NL*
cordiality
of
an
old
acquaintance
;
``
it
was
really
very
good
of
you
to
*NL*
recognize
me
so
quickly
,
and
still
more
so
to
bestow
your
first
visit
on
*NL*
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
assured
,
''
replied
Albert
,
``
that
if
I
had
been
aware
of
your
arrival
*NL*
in
Paris
,
and
had
known
your
address
,
I
should
have
paid
my
respects
*NL*
to
you
before
this
.
Allow
me
to
introduce
my
friend
,
Baron
de
*NL*
Chateau-Renaud
,
one
of
the
few
true
gentlemen
now
to
be
found
in
France
,
*NL*
and
from
whom
I
have
just
learned
that
you
were
a
spectator
of
the
races
*NL*
in
the
Champ-de-Mars
,
yesterday
.
''
Chateau-Renaud
bowed
to
the
countess
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
were
at
the
races
,
baron
?
''
inquired
the
countess
eagerly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
madame
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
''
pursued
Madame
G
--
with
considerable
animation
,
``
you
can
*NL*
probably
tell
me
who
won
the
Jockey
Club
stakes
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sorry
to
say
I
can
not
,
''
replied
the
baron
;
``
and
I
was
just
asking
*NL*
the
same
question
of
Albert
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
very
anxious
to
know
,
countess
?
''
asked
Albert
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
know
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
name
of
the
owner
of
the
winning
horse
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Excessively
;
only
imagine

do
tell
me

whether
you
really
*NL*
are
acquainted
with
it
or
no
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beg
your
pardon

madame
,
but
you
were
about
to
relate
some
story
,
*NL*
were
you
not

You
said
,
`

--
and
then
paused
.
Pray
*NL*
continue
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
listen
.
You
must
know
I
felt
so
interested
in
the
splendid
*NL*
roan
horse
,
with
his
elegant
little
rider
,
so
tastefully
dressed
in
*NL*
a
pink
satin
jacket
and
cap
,
that
I
could
not
help
praying
for
their
*NL*
success
with
as
much
earnestness
as
though
the
half
of
my
fortune
were
*NL*
at
stake
;
and
when
I
saw
them
outstrip
all
the
others
,
and
come
to
the
*NL*
winning-post
in
such
gallant
style
,
I
actually
clapped
my
hands
with
*NL*
joy
.
Imagine
my
surprise
,
when
,
upon
returning
home
,
the
first
object
*NL*
I
met
on
the
staircase
was
the
identical
jockey
in
the
pink
jacket
!
I
*NL*
concluded
that
,
by
some
singular
chance
,
the
owner
of
the
winning
horse
*NL*
must
live
in
the
same
hotel
as
myself
;
but
,
as
I
entered
my
apartments
,
*NL*
I
beheld
the
very
gold
cup
awarded
as
a
prize
to
the
unknown
horse
and
*NL*
rider
.
Inside
the
cup
was
a
small
piece
of
paper
,
on
which
were
written
*NL*
these
words
--
`
From
Lord
Ruthven
to
Countess
G
--
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Precisely
;
I
was
sure
of
it
,
''
said
Morcerf
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sure
of
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
the
owner
of
the
horse
was
Lord
Ruthven
himself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
Lord
Ruthven
do
you
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
our
Lord
Ruthven
--
the
Vampire
of
the
Salle
Argentino
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
possible
?
''
exclaimed
the
countess
;
``
is
he
here
in
Paris
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
be
sure
,
--
why
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
visit
him
?

meet
him
at
your
own
house
and
elsewhere
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
assure
you
he
is
my
most
intimate
friend

M.
de
Chateau-Renaud

has
also
the
honor
of
his
acquaintance

*NL*
*NL*

But

you
so
sure

his
being
the
winner

the
Jockey
Club

prize

What
of

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

yes

wonderful

To

I
remember
it
all
now

*NL*
``
He
called

You

it

evident
where

*NL*

his

spoken
much
of
you

in

lively
an
interest

*NL*

*NL*
*NL*

presenting

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

that
is
dreadful

Why

the
man
must
owe
me
a
fearful
grudge

*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
his
action
appear

``
No

effect
does
he
produce

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

said
Albert
,
``
he
was
talked
about
for
a
week
;
then
the
*NL*
coronation
of
the
queen
of
England
took
place
,
followed
by
the
theft
of
*NL*
Mademoiselle
Mars
's
diamonds
;
and
so
people
talked
of
something
else
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
good
fellow
,
''
said
Chateau-Renaud
,
``
the
count
is
your
friend
and
*NL*
you
treat
him
accordingly
.
Do
not
believe
what
Albert
is
telling
you
,
*NL*
countess
;
so
far
from
the
sensation
excited
in
the
Parisian
circles
by
*NL*
the
appearance
of
the
Count
of
Monte
Cristo
having
abated
,
I
take
upon
*NL*
myself
to
declare
that
it
is
as
strong
as
ever
.
His
first
astounding
*NL*
act
upon
coming
amongst
us
was
to
present
a
pair
of
horses
,
worth
*NL*
32,000
francs
,
to
Madame
Danglars
;
his
second
,
the
almost
miraculous
*NL*
preservation
of
Madame
de
Villefort
's
life
;
now
it
seems
that
he
has
*NL*
carried
off
the
prize
awarded
by
the
Jockey
Club
.
I
therefore
maintain
,
*NL*
in
spite
of
Morcerf
,
that
not
only
is
the
count
the
object
of
interest
*NL*
at
this
present
moment
,
but
also
that
he
will
continue
to
be
so
for
a
*NL*
month
longer
if
he
pleases
to
exhibit
an
eccentricity
of
conduct
which
,
*NL*
after
all
,
may
be
his
ordinary
mode
of
existence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
you
are
right

said
Morcerf
;
``
meanwhile
,
who
is
in
the
Russian
*NL*
ambassador
's
box
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Which
box
do
you
mean

''
asked
the
countess

*NL*
*NL*
``
The
one
between
the
pillars
on

fitted
up
entirely
afresh

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
observe
any
one
during

asked
Chateau-Renaud

*NL*
*NL*
``

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
that
box

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

''
replied
the
countess
,
``
it
was
certainly
empty
during
the
first
*NL*
act
;
''
then
,
resuming
the
subject
of
their
previous
conversation
,
she
*NL*
said
,
``
And
so
you
really
believe
it
was
your
mysterious
Count
of
Monte
*NL*
Cristo
that
gained
the
prize
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sure
of
it

*NL*
*NL*
``

who
afterwards
sent
the

me

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
do
n't

said
the

I
have
a
great

return
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
no
such
thing

beg
of
you

only
send

another

magnificent
sapphire

hollowed
out
of
a
gigantic
ruby
.
It
is
*NL*
his
way
,
and
you
must
take
him
as
you
find
him
.
''
At
this
moment
the
*NL*
bell
rang
to
announce
the
drawing
up
of
the
curtain
for
the
second
act
.
*NL*
Albert
rose
to
return
to
his
place
.
``
Shall
I
see
you
again
?
''
asked
the
*NL*
countess
.
``
At
the
end
of
the
next
act
,
with
your
permission

I
will
come
*NL*
and
inquire
whether
there
is
anything
I
can
do
for
you
in
Paris
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pray
take
notice
,
''
said
the
countess
,
``
that
my
present
residence
is
*NL*
22
Rue
de
Rivoli
,
and
that
I
am
at
home
to
my
friends
every
Saturday
*NL*
evening
.
So
now
,
you
are
both
forewarned
.
''
The
young
men
bowed
,
and
*NL*
quitted
the
box
.
Upon
reaching
their
stalls
,
they
found
the
whole
of
the
*NL*
audience
in
the
parterre
standing
up
and
directing
their
gaze
towards
*NL*
the
box
formerly
possessed
by
the
Russian
ambassador
.
A
man
of
from
*NL*
thirty-five
to
forty
years
of
age
,
dressed
in
deep
black
,
had
just
*NL*
entered
,
accompanied
by
a
young
woman
dressed
after
the
Eastern
style
.
*NL*
The
lady
was
surpassingly
beautiful
,
while
the
rich
magnificence
of
her
*NL*
attire
drew
all
eyes
upon
her
.
``
Hullo
,
''
said
Albert
;
``
it
is
Monte
Cristo
*NL*
and
his
Greek
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
strangers
were
,
indeed
,
no
other
than
the
count
and
Haidee
.
In
a
few
*NL*
moments
the
young
girl
had
attracted
the
attention
of
the
whole
house
,
*NL*
and
even
the
occupants
of
the
boxes
leaned
forward
to
scrutinize
her
*NL*
magnificent
diamonds
.
The
second
act
passed
away
during
one
continued
*NL*
buzz
of
voices
--
one
deep
whisper
--
intimating
that
some
great
and
*NL*
universally
interesting
event
had
occurred
;
all
eyes
,
all
thoughts
,
were
*NL*
occupied
with
the
young
and
beautiful
woman
,
whose
gorgeous
apparel
and
*NL*
splendid
jewels
made
a
most
extraordinary
spectacle
.
Upon
this
occasion
*NL*
an
unmistakable
sign
from
Madame
Danglars
intimated
her
desire
to
see
*NL*
Albert
in
her
box
directly
the
curtain
fell
on
the
second
act
,
and
*NL*
neither
the
politeness
nor
good
taste
of
Morcerf
would
permit
his
*NL*
neglecting
an
invitation
so
unequivocally
given
.
At
the
close
of
the
act
*NL*
he
therefore
went
to
the
baroness
.
Having
bowed
to
the
two
ladies
,
he
*NL*
extended
his
hand
to
Debray
.
By
the
baroness
he
was
most
graciously
*NL*
welcomed
,
while
Eugenie
received
him
with
her
accustomed
coldness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
fellow
,
''
said
Debray
,
``
you
have
come
in
the
nick
of
time

*NL*
There
is
madame
overwhelming
me
with
questions
respecting
the
count

she
*NL*
insists
upon
it
that
I
can
tell
her
his
birth
,
education
,
and
parentage
,
*NL*
where
he
came
from
,
and
whither
he
is
going
.
Being
no
disciple
of
*NL*
Cagliostro
,
I
was
wholly
unable
to
do
this
;
so
,
by
way
of
getting
out
*NL*
of
the
scrape
,
I
said
,
`
Ask
Morcerf
;
he
has
got
the
whole
history
of
*NL*
his
beloved
Monte
Cristo
at
his
fingers

ends
;
'
whereupon
the
baroness
*NL*
signified
her
desire
to
see
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
not
almost
incredible
,
''
said
Madame
Danglars
,
``
that
a
person
*NL*
having
at
least
half
a
million
of
secret-service
money
at
his
command

*NL*
should
possess
so
little
information

*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
assure
you

said
Lucien

``
that
had
I
really
the
sum

you
mention
at

I
would
employ
it
more
profitably

in
*NL*
troubling
myself
to
obtain
particulars
respecting
the
Count
of
Monte
*NL*
Cristo
,
whose
only
merit
in
my
eyes
consists
in
his
being
twice
as
rich
*NL*
as
a
nabob

However
,
I
have
turned
the
business
over
to
Morcerf
,
so
pray
*NL*
settle
it
with
him
as
may
be
most
agreeable
to
you

for
my

care
nothing

his
mysterious
doings

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
sure

sent
me

32,000

wearing
on
their
heads
four
diamonds
valued
at
5,000

each

*NL*
*NL*
``
He
seems
to
have
a
mania

diamonds

Morcerf
,
smiling
,
``

I
*NL*
verily
believe
that

Potemkin

keeps
his

filled

sake
of
strewing
them
along
the
road

Tom
Thumb
did

*NL*

Perhaps

*NL*

Albert

I
can
readily
believe

*NL*

And

further

stated

staying
a

he
proposed

one
day

I
chanced
to
be
breakfasting

with

I
heard
the
sound

been
touched

I

Debray

laughing

she
laughingly
pointed
to
the

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

no

exclaimed
Debray
;

that

not

Eugenie

her
to

observe
him
sooner

dreadfully
pale

I
quite
agree

Morcerf

speaking

made

parting
bow

Just
as
he
was
*NL*
passing
the
count

box
,
the
door
opened

Monte

came
forth

*NL*
After
giving
some
directions
to
Ali

who
stood
in
the
lobby

the
count
*NL*
took
Albert
's
arm
.
Carefully
closing
the
box
door
,
Ali
placed
himself
*NL*
before
it
,
while
a
crowd
of
spectators
assembled
round
the
Nubian
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Upon
my
word

said
Monte

``
Paris
is
a
strange
city

the

Parisians
a

collected

around
poor
Ali

much
astonished
as
themselves

really
one
*NL*
might
suppose
he
was
the
only
Nubian
they
had
ever
beheld

Now
I
can
*NL*
promise
you
,
that
a
Frenchman
might
show
himself
in

either
in

far
as
Ali
is
concerned

I
can
assure
you

the

Ah

then
,
I
suppose
you
heard
Haidee

weary
hour
in
playing
over
to
me
the

Morcerf
did
not
pursue
the
subject
,
and
Monte
Cristo
himself
fell
*NL*
into
a
silent
reverie
.
The
bell
rang
at
this
moment
for
the
rising
of
*NL*
the
curtain
.
``
You
will
excuse
my
leaving
you

said
the
count
,
turning
*NL*
in
the
direction
of
his
box

*NL*
``
What

Are
you
going

The
third
act
had
begun
;
and
during
its
progress
the
Count
of
Morcerf
,
*NL*
according
to
his
promise
,
made
his
appearance
in
the
box
of
Madame
*NL*
Danglars
.
The
Count
of
Morcerf
was
not
a
person
to
excite
either
*NL*
interest
or
curiosity
in
a
place
of
public
amusement
;
his
presence
,
*NL*
therefore
,
was
wholly
unnoticed
,
save
by
the
occupants
of
the
box
in
*NL*
which
he
had
just
seated
himself
.
The
quick
eye
of
Monte
Cristo
however
,
*NL*
marked
his
coming
;
and
a
slight
though
meaning
smile
passed
over
his
*NL*
lips
.
Haidee
,
whose
soul
seemed
centred
in
the
business
of
the
stage
,
*NL*
like
all
unsophisticated
natures
,
delighted
in
whatever
addressed
itself
*NL*
to
the
eye
or
ear
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
third
act
passed
off
as
usual
.
Mesdemoiselles
Noblet
,
Julie
,
and
*NL*
Leroux
executed
the
customary
pirouettes
;
Robert
duly
challenged
the
*NL*
Prince
of
Granada
;
and
the
royal
father
of
the
princess
Isabella
,
taking
*NL*
his
daughter
by
the
hand
,
swept
round
the
stage
with
majestic
strides
,
*NL*
the
better
to
display
the
rich
folds
of
his
velvet
robe
and
mantle
.
*NL*
After
which
the
curtain
again
fell
,
and
the
spectators
poured
forth
from
*NL*
the
theatre
into
the
lobbies
and
salon
.
The
count
left
his
box
,
and
a
*NL*
moment
later
was
saluting
the
Baronne
Danglars
,
who
could
not
restrain
*NL*
a
cry
of
mingled
pleasure
and
surprise
.
``
You
are
welcome

she
*NL*
exclaimed
,
as
he
entered
.

I

and
I
feel
almost
mortified
to

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

Madame

continued
the
baroness
,
turning
towards
her
*NL*
daughter
,
``
this
is
the
Count

''
The
Count
bowed
,
while
*NL*
Mademoiselle
Danglars
bent
her
head
slightly
.
``
You
have
a
charming
young

said
Eugenie
.
``
Is

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

said
Monte

,
astonished
at
the
coolness
and
*NL*
freedom
of
the
question
.
``
She
is
a
poor
unfortunate
Greek
left

*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*

Monte

*NL*
``

the
Count
of
Morcerf
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

indeed

said
Madame
Danglars
;
``

*NL*
*NL*
``

Morcerf
;
``
and

it
is
no
secret
that

owe

to

of
the
illustrious
Albanese
chief

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But

''
exclaimed
Madame

.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
?
''
stammered
Morcerf
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
''
said
Monte
Cristo
placing
his
arms
around
the
count
,
and
*NL*
leaning
with
him
over
the
front
of
the
box
,
just
as
Haidee
,
whose
*NL*
eyes
were
occupied
in
examining
the
theatre
in
search
of
her
guardian
,
*NL*
perceived
his
pale
features
close
to
Morcerf
's
face
.
It
was
as
if
the
*NL*
young
girl
beheld
the
head
of
Medusa
.
She
bent
forwards
as
though
to
*NL*
assure
herself
of
the
reality
of
what
she
saw
,
then
,
uttering
a
faint
*NL*
cry
,
threw
herself
back
in
her
seat
.
The
sound
was
heard
by
the
people
*NL*
about
Ali
,
who
instantly
opened
the
box-door
.
``
Why
,
count
,
''
exclaimed
*NL*
Eugenie
,
``
what
has
happened
to
your
ward
?
she
seems
to
have
been
taken
*NL*
suddenly
ill
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
probably
,
''
answered
the
count
.
``
But
do
not
be
alarmed
on
her
*NL*
account
.
Haidee
's
nervous
system
is
delicately
organized
,
and
she
is
*NL*
peculiarly
susceptible
to
the
odors
even
of
flowers
--
nay
,
there
are
*NL*
some
which
cause
her
to
faint
if
brought
into
her
presence
.
However
,
''
*NL*
continued
Monte
Cristo
,
drawing
a
small
phial
from
his
pocket
,
``
I
have
*NL*
an
infallible
remedy
.
''
So
saying
,
he
bowed
to
the
baroness
and
her
*NL*
daughter
,
exchanged
a
parting
shake
of
the
hand
with
Debray
and
the
*NL*
count
,
and
left
Madame
Danglars
'
box
.
Upon
his
return
to
Haidee
he
found
*NL*
her
still
very
pale
.
As
soon
as
she
saw
him
she
seized
his
hand
;
her
own
*NL*
hands
were
moist
and
icy
cold
.
``
Who
was
it
you
were
talking
with
over
*NL*
there
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
the
Count
of
Morcerf
,
''
answered
Monte
Cristo
.
``
He
tells
me
he
*NL*
served
your
illustrious
father
,
and
that
he
owes
his
fortune
to
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wretch
!
''
exclaimed
Haidee
,
her
eyes
flashing
with
rage
;
``
he
sold
my
*NL*
father
to
the
Turks
,
and
the
fortune
he
boasts
of
was
the
price
of
his
*NL*
treachery
!
Did
not
you
know
that
,
my
dear
lord
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Something
of
this
I
heard
in
Epirus
,
''
said
Monte
Cristo
;
``
but
the
*NL*
particulars
are
still
unknown
to
me

You
shall
relate
them
to
me

my

child

They
are

no

both
curious

interesting

*NL*
``
Yes

yes

let
us
go

I
feel
as
though
it
would
kill
me
to
remain
*NL*
long
near
that
dreadful
man

So
saying
,
Haidee
arose
,
and
wrapping
*NL*
herself
in
her
burnoose
of
white
cashmire
embroidered
with
pearls
and
*NL*
coral
,
she
hastily
quitted
the
box
at
the
moment
when
the
curtain
was
*NL*
rising
upon
the
fourth
act
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
observe

said
the
Countess
G

to
Albert

who
had
returned
*NL*
to
her
side
,
``
that
man
does
nothing

listens
most

devoutly

A
Flurry
in
Stocks
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
days
after
this
meeting
,
Albert
de
Morcerf
visited
the
Count
of
*NL*
Monte
Cristo
at
his
house
in
the
Champs
Elysees
,
which
had
already
*NL*
assumed
that
palace-like
appearance
which
the
count
's
princely
fortune
*NL*
enabled
him
to
give
even
to
his
most
temporary
residences
.
He
came
to
*NL*
renew
the
thanks
of
Madame
Danglars
which
had
been
already
conveyed
to
*NL*
the
count
through
the
medium
of
a
letter
,
signed
``
Baronne
Danglars
,
*NL*
nee
Hermine
de
Servieux
.
''
Albert
was
accompanied
by
Lucien
Debray
,
who
,
*NL*
joining
in
his
friend
's
conversation
,
added
some
passing
compliments
,
*NL*
the
source
of
which
the
count
's
talent
for
finesse
easily
enabled
him
to
*NL*
guess
.
He
was
convinced
that
Lucien
's
visit
was
due
to
a
double
feeling
*NL*
of
curiosity
,
the
larger
half
of
which
sentiment
emanated
from
the
*NL*
Rue
de
la
Chaussee
d'Antin
.
In
short
,
Madame
Danglars
,
not
being
able
*NL*
personally
to
examine
in
detail
the
domestic
economy
and
household
*NL*
arrangements
of
a
man
who
gave
away
horses
worth
30,000
francs
and
who
*NL*
went
to
the
opera
with
a
Greek
slave
wearing
diamonds
to
the
amount
of
a
*NL*
million
of
money
,
had
deputed
those
eyes
,
by
which
she
was
accustomed
*NL*
to
see
,
to
give
her
a
faithful
account
of
the
mode
of
life
of
this
*NL*
incomprehensible
person
.
But
the
count
did
not
appear
to
suspect
that
*NL*
there
could
be
the
slightest
connection
between
Lucien
's
visit
and
the
*NL*
curiosity
of
the
baroness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
in
constant
communication
with
the
Baron
Danglars
?
''
the
count
*NL*
inquired
of
Albert
de
Morcerf
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
count
,
you
know
what
I
told
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
remains
the
same
,
then
,
in
that
quarter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
more
than
ever
a
settled
thing
,
''
said
Lucien
,
--
and
,
considering
*NL*
that
this
remark
was
all
that
he
was
at
that
time
called
upon
to
make
,
*NL*
he
adjusted
the
glass
to
his
eye
,
and
biting
the
top
of
his
gold
headed
*NL*
cane
,
began
to
make
the
tour
of
the
apartment
,
examining
the
arms
and
*NL*
the
pictures
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
said
Monte
Cristo
``
I
did
not
expect
that
the
affair
would
be
so
*NL*
promptly
concluded
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
things
take
their
course
without
our
assistance

While
we
are
*NL*
forgetting
them
,
they
are
falling
into
their
appointed
order
;
and
*NL*
when
,
again
,
our
attention
is
directed
to
them
,
we
are
surprised
at
*NL*
the
progress
they
have
made
towards
the
proposed
end
.
My
father
and
M.
*NL*
Danglars
served
together
in
Spain
,
my
father
in
the
army
and
M.
Danglars
*NL*
in
the
commissariat
department
.
It
was
there
that
my
father

ruined
by
*NL*
the
revolution
,
and
M.
Danglars
,
who
never
had
possessed
any
patrimony
,
*NL*
both
laid
the
foundations
of
their
different
fortunes

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

''
said
Monte

``
I
think
M.
Danglars
mentioned
that
in
a
visit
*NL*
which
I
paid
him
;
and

continued
he
,
casting
a
side-glance
at
Lucien
,
*NL*
who
was
turning
over
the
leaves
of
an
album
,
``
Mademoiselle
Eugenie

*NL*
pretty

I

I
remember
that

*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
pretty

or
rather

very
beautiful

replied
Albert
,
``
but
of
that
*NL*
style
of
beauty
which
I
do
not
appreciate
;
I
am
an
ungrateful
fellow

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
speak
as
if
you
were
already
her
husband

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

returned
Albert
,
in
his
turn
looking
around
to
see
what
Lucien
was
*NL*
doing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
,
''
said
Monte
Cristo
,
lowering
his
voice
,
``
you
do
not
appear
to

very
enthusiastic
on

*NL*
*NL*
``
Mademoiselle
Danglars

too
rich

replied
Morcerf
,
``
and
that
*NL*
frightens
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bah

''
exclaimed
Monte
Cristo
,
``
that
's
a
fine
reason
to
give
.
Are
you
*NL*
not
rich
yourself
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
father
's
income
is
about
50,000
francs
per
annum
;
and
he
will
give
*NL*
me
,
perhaps
,
ten
or
twelve
thousand
when
I
marry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
,
perhaps
,
might
not
be
considered
a
large
sum
,
in
Paris
*NL*
especially
,
''
said
the
count
;
``
but
everything
does
not
depend
on
wealth

it
is
a
fine
thing

and
to
occupy
a
high
station

in
society

Your
name
is
celebrated

your
position
magnificent

and
*NL*
then
the
Comte

the
integrity

I
consider
the
union
with
Mademoiselle
Danglars
a
most
*NL*
suitable
one
;
she
will
enrich
you
,
and
you
will
ennoble
her
.

Albert
*NL*
shook
his
head
,
and
looked
thoughtful
.
``
There
is
still
something
else
,
''
*NL*
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
confess
,

observed
Monte

,
``
that
I
have
some
difficulty
in

comprehending
your
objection

a
young

both
rich

beautiful

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

said
Morcerf

this

not
all

*NL*

Whence

*NL*
*NL*

It
is
my

dissents

has
a
clear
and
penetrating
judgment

does
not
smile
on
the
proposed
union
.
I
can
not
account
for
it
,

*NL*
she
seems
to
entertain
some
prejudice
against
the
Danglars
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,

said
the
count
,
in
a
somewhat
forced
tone
,
``
that
may
be
easily
*NL*
explained
;
the
Comtesse
de
Morcerf
,
who
is
aristocracy

refinement
*NL*
itself
,
does
not
relish
the
idea
of
being
allied
by
your
marriage
with
*NL*
one
of
ignoble
birth
;
that
is
natural
enough
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do

miserable

There
was
to
have
been
a
meeting
six
weeks
ago
in
order
*NL*
to
talk
over

settle
the
affair
;

I
had
such
a
sudden
attack
of
*NL*
indisposition

*NL*
*NL*
``
Real

interrupted
the

smiling

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

real
enough

from
anxiety

postponed

the

There

no

Monte
*NL*
Cristo
turned
away
;
he
seemed
moved
by
this
last
remark

``
Ah

he
*NL*
to
Debray

had
thrown
himself
into

easy-chair
at

farthest

held

sketch

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

no

was
the
tranquil
response

I
am
too
fond

I
am
calculating
what
the
house
of
Danglars
must
have
gained
by
the
*NL*
last
rise
in

bonds
;
from
206
they
have
risen
to
409

three
days

the
prudent
banker
had
purchased
at
206

he
must
have
made

300,000
livres

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
not
his

sold

instead

And
what

the

Morcerf

with
a

smile

*NL*
*NL*
``
How

I

asked
Lucien

Your

the
stockbrokers

stenograph
your

Lucien

*NL*
``
It

very
clear

replied
the

with
an

artlessness
wholly
free
from
affectation

you
alone

for
instance

that
Henri

seen
yesterday
at

That
would
boom
the
market

announces

well-informed
persons
that

king
was
seen
yesterday
at
Gabrielle

house
,
is
totally
without
foundation

We
can
positively
assert
that
his
*NL*
majesty
did
not
quit
the
Pont-Neuf

Lucien
half
smiled
.
Monte
*NL*
Cristo
,
although
apparently
indifferent
,
had
not
lost
one
word
of
this
*NL*
conversation
,
and
his
penetrating
eye
had
even
read
a
hidden
secret
*NL*
in
the
embarrassed
manner
of
the
secretary
.
This
embarrassment
had
*NL*
completely
escaped
Albert
,
but
it
caused
Lucien
to
shorten
his
visit
;
*NL*
he
was
evidently
ill
at
ease

The
count

in
taking
leave

said

something
in
a
low
voice

to

he
answered

Willingly

*NL*
``
Do
you
not
think

him

*NL*
*NL*
``
So
much
so

overwhelmed
me

politeness
in

a
casual
piece

*NL*
enabled
me
to
render
him

I
predict
from
all
this
an
avalanche
of

dinners

Now

presume
on
this

I
should
give

the

Madame

look

upon
the
affair
in

light

especially
if
Baron

did
me
the
*NL*
honor
to
bring
his
daughter

In
that

your
mother
would
hold
me
in
*NL*
aversion

I
do
not
at
all
wish
that

on
the
contrary

I
desire
to

stand
high
in
her
esteem

*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed

said
Morcerf

``
I
thank
you
sincerely

used
so
*NL*
much
candor
towards

I
gratefully
accept

which
you
*NL*
propose

You
say
you
desire
my

good
opinion

I
assure
you
it
is
*NL*
already
yours

a
very
unusual
extent

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do

with
interest

*NL*

You

Major

a

whose

Dante
has
celebrated
in
the
tenth

you
not

Then
there

his

Andrea

a

about

who
is
making
his
entry

aided

The
major
will
bring
his

this

the
contino

I
will
do
what
I

you
not

constantly
in

I
have
met
him
several
times
at
Florence

Bologna
*NL*
and
Lucca
,

he
has
now
communicated
to
me
the
fact

his
arrival

Paris

The
acquaintances
one
makes
in
travelling
have
a
sort

one

everywhere
expect

receive
the

attention

you
once

you

This

good
Major

take

saw
in
passing
through
in

time

he
was
on

his

to
Moscow

let
him
follow

Major
Cavalcanti
.
*NL*
*NL*
Both
the
count
and
Baptistin
had
told
the
truth
when
they
announced
to
*NL*
Morcerf
the
proposed
visit
of
the
major
,
which
had
served
Monte
Cristo
*NL*
as
a
pretext
for
declining
Albert
's
invitation
.
Seven
o'clock
had
just
*NL*
struck
,
and
M.
Bertuccio
,
according
to
the
command
which
had
been
given
*NL*
him
,
had
two
hours
before
left
for
Auteuil
,
when
a
cab
stopped
at
the
*NL*
door
,
and
after
depositing
its
occupant
at
the
gate
,
immediately
hurried
*NL*
away
,
as
if
ashamed
of
its
employment
.
The
visitor
was
about
fifty-two
*NL*
years
of
age
,
dressed
in
one
of
the
green
surtouts
,
ornamented
with
*NL*
black
frogs
,
which
have
so
long
maintained
their
popularity
all
over
*NL*
Europe
.
He
wore
trousers
of
blue
cloth
,
boots
tolerably
clean
,
but
not
*NL*
of
the
brightest
polish
,
and
a
little
too
thick
in
the
soles
,
buckskin
*NL*
gloves
,
a
hat
somewhat
resembling
in
shape
those
usually
worn
by
*NL*
the
gendarmes
,
and
a
black
cravat
striped
with
white
,
which
,
if
the
*NL*
proprietor
had
not
worn
it
of
his
own
free
will
,
might
have
passed
for
a
*NL*
halter
,
so
much
did
it
resemble
one
.
Such
was
the
picturesque
costume
of
*NL*
the
person
who
rang
at
the
gate
,
and
demanded
if
it
was
not
at
No.

in
*NL*
the
Avenue
des
Champs-Elysees

the
Count

*NL*
the
gate
after
him
,
and
began
to
ascend
the
steps
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
small
and
angular
head
of
this
man
,
his
white
hair
and
thick
gray
*NL*
mustaches
,
caused
him
to
be
easily
recognized
by
Baptistin
,
who
had
*NL*
received
an
exact
description
of
the
expected
visitor
,
and
who
was
*NL*
awaiting
him
in
the
hall
.
Therefore
,
scarcely
had
the
stranger
time
to
*NL*
pronounce
his
name
before
the
count
was
apprised
of
his
arrival
.
He
was
*NL*
ushered
into
a
simple
and
elegant
drawing-room
,
and
the
count
rose
to
*NL*
meet
him
with
a
smiling
air
.
``
Ah
,
my
dear
sir
,
you
are
most
welcome
;
I
*NL*
was
expecting
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
''
said
the
Italian
,
``
was
your
excellency
then
aware
of
my
*NL*
visit
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
I
had
been
told
that
I
should
see
you
to-day
at
seven
o'clock

*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
have
received
full
information
concerning
my
arrival

*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
so
much
the
better
,
I
feared
this
little
precaution
might
have
been
*NL*
forgotten
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
precaution
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
of
informing
you
beforehand
of
my
coming
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
it
has
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
are
sure
you
are
not
mistaken

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
sure

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
really
was
I
whom
your
excellency
expected
at
seven
o'clock
this
*NL*
evening
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
prove
it
to
you
beyond
a
doubt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
never
mind
that
,
''
said
the
Italian
;
``
it
is
not
worth
the
*NL*
trouble
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
''
said
Monte
Cristo
.
His
visitor
appeared
slightly
uneasy
.
*NL*
``
Let
me
see
,
''
said
the
count
;
``
are
you
not
the
Marquis
Bartolomeo
*NL*
Cavalcanti
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bartolomeo
Cavalcanti

joyfully
replied
the
Italian
;
``
yes

I
am
really
*NL*
he

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ex-major
in
the
Austrian
service
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
I
a
major

timidly
asked
the
old
soldier
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

''
said
Monte
Cristo
``
you
were
a
major

that
is
the
title

which
you
filled

*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
good

said
the
major
,
``
I
do
not
demand
more

understand

*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
visit
here
to-day
is
not
of
your

it

said
*NL*
Monte

.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

certainly
not

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
were
sent
by

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

*NL*

By
the
excellent

*NL*
*NL*

Exactly
so

the
delighted

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
have
a

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

there
it
is

*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
it
me
,
then
;

and
Monte
Cristo
took
the
letter
,
which
he
opened
*NL*
and
read
.
The
major
looked
at
the
count
with
his
large
staring
eyes
,
*NL*
and
then
took
a
survey
of
the
apartment
,
but
his
gaze
almost
immediately
*NL*
reverted
to
the
proprietor
of
the
room
.
``
Yes

yes

continued
Monte

,
reading
aloud

an
*NL*
income
of

Monte

raised
his
eyes
from
the
paper

*NL*
and
bowed
.
``
Half

he
,
``
magnificent

*NL*
``

the

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

*NL*
``

I
had
no

the
Italian
gravely
;

Monte

resumed
the
perusal
of
the
letter
:

And
who
only
needs
one

more
to
make

happy

*NL*

the

with
a
sigh

to
recover

*NL*

*NL*

the

with

deep
sigh

and
raising
*NL*
his
eye
to
heaven
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

Monte

The
count
continued
:

The

looked
at
the

with
an
indescribable
expression

of
anxiety

I
have
the
power

said
Monte

The
major
*NL*
recovered
his
self-possession

he
,

The

awaited
the
conclusion

apparently
with
great

dilated

pleasing

drew
an

himself

The

advanced

in

low
voice

Baptistin
re-entered

with
glasses

wine

biscuits

The
count
filled
one
glass
,
but
in
the
*NL*
other
he
only
poured
a
few
drops
of
the
ruby-colored
liquid

The
bottle
*NL*
was
covered
with
spiders

webs

all
the
other
signs
which
indicate
*NL*
the
age

more
truly
than
do
wrinkles
on

The
major
*NL*
made
a
wise
choice
;
he
took
the
full
glass
and
a
biscuit
.
The
count
told
*NL*
Baptistin
to
leave
the
plate
within
reach

his
guest

who
began
by
*NL*
sipping
the
Alicante
with
an
expression
of
great
satisfaction

and
then
*NL*
delicately
steeped
his
biscuit
in
the
wine

*NL*
*NL*
``
So

raised
his

sighed

The

recovered
himself

resumed
his

calm

manner

at
the

time
casting
his

down

either

all

the
protracted

was
in
ecstasy
at
the
*NL*
attention
paid
him
by
the
count

*NL*
*NL*
``
Now

said
Monte
Cristo
,
``
that
you

fortified
yourself

painful

yourself

Saying
which
Monte

bowed
,
and
disappeared
*NL*
behind
the
tapestry
,
leaving
the
major
fascinated
beyond
expression
*NL*
with
the
delightful
reception
which
he
had
received
at
the
hands
of
the
*NL*
count

Andrea
Cavalcanti
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Count
of
Monte
Cristo
entered
the
adjoining
room
,
which
Baptistin
*NL*
had
designated
as
the
drawing-room
,
and
found
there
a
young
man
,
of
*NL*
graceful
demeanor
and
elegant
appearance
,
who
had
arrived
in
a
cab
*NL*
about
half
an
hour
previously
.
Baptistin
had
not
found
any
difficulty
in
*NL*
recognizing
the
person
who
presented
himself
at
the
door
for
admittance
.
*NL*
He
was
certainly
the
tall
young
man
with
light
hair
,
red
beard
,
black
*NL*
eyes
,
and
brilliant
complexion
,
whom
his
master
had
so
particularly
*NL*
described
to
him
.
When
the
count
entered
the
room
the
young
man
was
*NL*
carelessly
stretched
on
a
sofa
,
tapping
his
boot
with
the
gold-headed
*NL*
cane
which
he
held
in
his
hand
.
On
perceiving
the
count
he
rose
quickly
.
*NL*
``
The
Count
of
Monte
Cristo
,
I
believe
?
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
,
and
I
think
I
have
the
honor
of
addressing
Count
Andrea
*NL*
Cavalcanti
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Count
Andrea
Cavalcanti
,
''
repeated
the
young
man
,
accompanying
his
*NL*
words
with
a
bow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
charged
with
a
letter
of
introduction
addressed
to
me
,
are
you
*NL*
not
?
''
said
the
count
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
not
mention
that
,
because
the
signature
seemed
to
me
so
strange
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
letter
signed
`
Sinbad
the
Sailor
,
'
is
it
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Exactly
so
.
Now
,
as
I
have
never
known
any
Sinbad
,
with
the
exception
*NL*
of
the
one
celebrated
in
the
`
Thousand
and
One
Nights
'
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
it
is
one
of
his
descendants
,
and
a
great
friend
of
mine
;
he
is
a
*NL*
very
rich
Englishman
,
eccentric
almost
to
insanity
,
and
his
real
name
is
*NL*
Lord
Wilmore
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
indeed
?
Then
that
explains
everything
that
is
extraordinary

*NL*
said
Andrea
.
``
He
is
,
then

the
same
Englishman
whom
I
met

at

yes

*NL*
indeed

Well

monsieur

I
am
at
your
service

*NL*
*NL*
``
If
what
you
say
be
true

replied
the
count
,
smiling
,
``
perhaps
you
will
*NL*
be
kind
enough
to
give
me
some
account
of
yourself
and
your
family
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
,
I
will
do
so
,
''
said
the
young
man
,
with
a
quickness
which
*NL*
gave
proof
of
his
ready
invention
.
``
I
am
-LRB-
as
you
have
said
-RRB-
the
Count
*NL*
Andrea
Cavalcanti
,
son
of
Major
Bartolomeo
Cavalcanti
,
a
descendant
of
*NL*
the
Cavalcanti
whose
names
are
inscribed
in
the
golden
book
at
Florence
.
*NL*
Our
family
,
although
still
rich
-LRB-
for
my
father
's
income
amounts
to
half
*NL*
a
million
-RRB-
,
has
experienced
many
misfortunes
,
and
I
myself
was
,
at
the
*NL*
age
of
five
years
,
taken
away
by
the
treachery
of
my
tutor
,
so
that
for
*NL*
fifteen
years
I
have
not
seen
the
author
of
my
existence
.
Since
I
have
*NL*
arrived
at
years
of
discretion
and
become
my
own
master
,
I
have
been
*NL*
constantly
seeking
him
,
but
all
in
vain
.
At
length
I
received
this
*NL*
letter
from
your
friend
,
which
states
that
my
father
is
in
Paris
,
and
*NL*
authorizes
me
to
address
myself
to
you
for
information
respecting
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
,
all
you
have
related
to
me
is
exceedingly
interesting
,
''
said
*NL*
Monte
Cristo
,
observing
the
young
man
with
a
gloomy
satisfaction
;
``
and
*NL*
you
have
done
well
to
conform
in
everything
to
the
wishes
of
my
friend
*NL*
Sinbad
;
for
your
father
is
indeed
here
,
and
is
seeking
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
count
from
the
moment
of
first
entering
the
drawing-room
,
had
not
*NL*
once
lost
sight
of
the
expression
of
the
young
man
's
countenance
;
he
had
*NL*
admired
the
assurance
of
his
look
and
the
firmness
of
his
voice
;
but
at
*NL*
these
words
,
so
natural
in
themselves
,
``
Your
father
is
indeed
here
,
and
*NL*
is
seeking
you
,
''
young
Andrea
started
,
and
exclaimed
,
``
My
father
?
Is
my
*NL*
father
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Most
undoubtedly
,
''
replied
Monte
Cristo
;
``
your
father
,
Major
Bartolomeo
*NL*
Cavalcanti
.
''
The
expression
of
terror
which
,
for
the
moment
,
had
*NL*
overspread
the
features
of
the
young
man
,
had
now
disappeared
.
``
Ah
,
yes
,
*NL*
that
is
the
name
,
certainly
.
Major
Bartolomeo
Cavalcanti
.
And
you
really
*NL*
mean
to
say
;
monsieur
,
that
my
dear
father
is
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
;
and
I
can
even
add
that
I
have
only
just
left
his
company
.
*NL*
The
history
which
he
related
to
me
of
his
lost
son
touched
me
to
the
*NL*
quick
;
indeed
,
his
griefs
,
hopes
,
and
fears
on
that
subject
might
*NL*
furnish
material
for
a
most
touching
and
pathetic
poem
.
At
length
,
he
*NL*
one
day
received
a
letter
,
stating
that
the
abductors
of
his
son
now
*NL*
offered
to
restore
him
,
or
at
least
to
give
notice
where
he
might
be
*NL*
found
,
on
condition
of
receiving
a
large
sum
of
money
,
by
way
of
ransom
.
*NL*
Your
father
did
not
hesitate
an
instant
,
and
the
sum
was
sent
to
the
*NL*
frontier
of
Piedmont
,
with
a
passport
signed
for
Italy
.
You
were
in
the
*NL*
south
of
France
,
I
think
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
replied
Andrea
,
with
an
embarrassed
air
,
``
I
was
in
the
south
of
*NL*
France
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
carriage
was
to
await
you
at
Nice
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Precisely
so
;
and
it
conveyed
me
from
Nice
to
Genoa
,
from
Genoa
to
*NL*
Turin
,
from
Turin
to
Chambery
,
from
Chambery
to
Pont-de-Beauvoisin
,
and
*NL*
from
Pont-de-Beauvoisin
to
Paris
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
?
Then
your
father
ought
to
have
met
with
you
on
the
road
,
for
it
*NL*
is
exactly
the
same
route
which
he
himself
took
,
and
that
is
how
we
have
*NL*
been
able
to
trace
your
journey
to
this
place
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
''
said
Andrea
,
``
if
my
father
had
met
me
,
I
doubt
if
he
would
have
*NL*
recognized
me
;
I
must
be
somewhat
altered
since
he
last
saw
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
the
voice
of
nature
,
''
said
Monte
Cristo
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
True
,
''
interrupted
the
young
man
,
``
I
had
not
looked
upon
it
in
that
*NL*
light
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
''
replied
Monte
Cristo
``
there
is
only
one
source
of
uneasiness
left
*NL*
in
your
father
's
mind
,
which
is
this
--
he
is
anxious
to
know
how
you
*NL*
have
been
employed
during
your
long
absence
from
him
,
how
you
have
*NL*
been
treated
by
your
persecutors
,
and
if
they
have
conducted
themselves
*NL*
towards
you
with
all
the
deference
due
to
your
rank
.
Finally
,
he
is
*NL*
anxious
to
see
if
you
have
been
fortunate
enough
to
escape
the
bad
moral
*NL*
influence
to
which
you
have
been
exposed
,
and
which
is
infinitely
more
*NL*
to
be
dreaded
than
any
physical
suffering
;
he
wishes
to
discover
if
the
*NL*
fine
abilities
with
which
nature
had
endowed
you
have
been
weakened
by
*NL*
want
of
culture
;
and
,
in
short
,
whether
you
consider
yourself
capable
of
*NL*
resuming
and
retaining
in
the
world
the
high
position
to
which
your
rank
*NL*
entitles
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
!
''
exclaimed
the
young
man
,
quite
astounded
,
``
I
hope
no
false
*NL*
report
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
for
myself
,
I
first
heard
you
spoken
of
by
my
friend
Wilmore
,
the
*NL*
philanthropist
.
I
believe
he
found
you
in
some
unpleasant
position
,
but
*NL*
do
not
know
of
what
nature
,
for
I
did
not
ask
,
not
being
inquisitive
.
*NL*
Your
misfortunes
engaged
his
sympathies
,
so
you
see
you
must
have
*NL*
been
interesting
.
He
told
me
that
he
was
anxious
to
restore
you
to
the
*NL*
position
which
you
had
lost
,
and
that
he
would
seek
your
father
until
he
*NL*
found
him
.
He
did
seek
,
and
has
found
him
,
apparently
,
since
he
is
here
*NL*
now
;
and
,
finally
,
my
friend
apprised
me
of
your
coming
,
and
gave
me
a
*NL*
few
other
instructions
relative
to
your
future
fortune
.
I
am
quite
aware
*NL*
that
my
friend
Wilmore
is
peculiar
,
but
he
is
sincere
,
and
as
rich
as
a
*NL*
gold-mine
,
consequently
,
he
may
indulge
his
eccentricities
without
*NL*
any
fear
of
their
ruining
him
,
and
I
have
promised
to
adhere
to
his
*NL*
instructions
.
Now
,
sir
,
pray
do
not
be
offended
at
the
question
I
am
*NL*
about
to
put
to
you
,
as
it
comes
in
the
way
of
my
duty
as
your
patron
.
*NL*
I
would
wish
to
know
if
the
misfortunes
which
have
happened
to
*NL*
you
--
misfortunes
entirely
beyond
your
control
,
and
which
in
no
degree
*NL*
diminish
my
regard
for
you
--
I
would
wish
to
know
if
they
have
not
,
in
*NL*
some
measure
,
contributed
to
render
you
a
stranger
to
the
world
in
which
*NL*
your
fortune
and
your
name
entitle
you
to
make
a
conspicuous
figure
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
,
''
returned
the
young
man
,
with
a
reassurance
of
manner
,
``
make
*NL*
your
mind
easy
on
this
score
.
Those
who
took
me
from
my
father
,
and
*NL*
who
always
intended
,
sooner
or
later
,
to
sell
me
again
to
my
original
*NL*
proprietor
,
as
they
have
now
done
,
calculated
that
,
in
order
to
make
the
*NL*
most
of
their
bargain
,
it
would
be
politic
to
leave
me
in
possession
of
*NL*
all
my
personal
and
hereditary
worth
,
and
even
to
increase
the
value
,
*NL*
if
possible
.
I
have
,
therefore
,
received
a
very
good
education
,
and
have
*NL*
been
treated
by
these
kidnappers
very
much
as
the
slaves
were
treated
*NL*
in
Asia
Minor
,
whose
masters
made
them
grammarians
,
doctors
,
and
*NL*
philosophers
,
in
order
that
they
might
fetch
a
higher
price
in
the
Roman
*NL*
market
.
''
Monte
Cristo
smiled
with
satisfaction
;
it
appeared
as
if
he
had
*NL*
not
expected
so
much
from
M.
Andrea
Cavalcanti
.
``
Besides
,
''
continued
*NL*
the
young
man
,
``
if
there
did
appear
some
defect
in
education
,
or
offence
*NL*
against
the
established
forms
of
etiquette
,
I
suppose
it
would
be
*NL*
excused
,
in
consideration
of
the
misfortunes
which
accompanied
my
birth
,
*NL*
and
followed
me
through
my
youth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Monte
Cristo
in
an
indifferent
tone
,
``
you
will
do
as
you
*NL*
please
,
count
,
for
you
are
the
master
of
your
own
actions
,
and
are
the
*NL*
person
most
concerned
in
the
matter
,
but
if
I
were
you
,
I
would
not
*NL*
divulge
a
word
of
these
adventures
.
Your
history
is
quite
a
romance
,
*NL*
and
the
world
,
which
delights
in
romances
in
yellow
covers
,
strangely
*NL*
mistrusts
those
which
are
bound
in
living
parchment
,
even
though
they
be
*NL*
gilded
like
yourself
.
This
is
the
kind
of
difficulty
which
I
wished
*NL*
to
represent
to
you
,
my
dear
count
.
You
would
hardly
have
recited
your
*NL*
touching
history
before
it
would
go
forth
to
the
world
,
and
be
deemed
*NL*
unlikely
and
unnatural
.
You
would
be
no
longer
a
lost
child
found
,
*NL*
but
you
would
be
looked
upon
as
an
upstart
,
who
had
sprung
up
like
a
*NL*
mushroom
in
the
night
.
You
might
excite
a
little
curiosity
,
but
it
is
*NL*
not
every
one
who
likes
to
be
made
the
centre
of
observation
and
the
*NL*
subject
of
unpleasant
remark
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
agree
with
you
,
monsieur
,
''
said
the
young
man
,
turning
pale
,
and
,
*NL*
in
spite
of
himself
,
trembling
beneath
the
scrutinizing
look
of
his
*NL*
companion
,
``
such
consequences
would
be
extremely
unpleasant
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nevertheless
,
you
must
not
exaggerate
the
evil
,
''
said
Monte
Cristo
,
*NL*
``
for
by
endeavoring
to
avoid
one
fault
you
will
fall
into
another
.
You
*NL*
must
resolve
upon
one
simple
and
single
line
of
conduct
,
and
for
a
man
*NL*
of
your
intelligence
,
this
plan
is
as
easy
as
it
is
necessary
;
you
must
*NL*
form
honorable
friendships
,
and
by
that
means
counteract
the
prejudice
*NL*
which
may
attach
to
the
obscurity
of
your
former
life
.
''
Andrea
visibly
*NL*
changed
countenance
.
``
I
would
offer
myself
as
your
surety
and
friendly
*NL*
adviser
,
''
said
Monte
Cristo
,
``
did
I
not
possess
a
moral
distrust
of
my
*NL*
best
friends
,
and
a
sort
of
inclination
to
lead
others
to
doubt
them
*NL*
too
;
therefore
,
in
departing
from
this
rule
,
I
should
-LRB-
as
the
actors
*NL*
say
-RRB-
be
playing
a
part
quite
out
of
my
line
,
and
should
,
therefore
,
run
*NL*
the
risk
of
being
hissed

would
be
an
act
of
folly

that
the
season
of
your
youth
was
*NL*
rather
a
stormy
one

Ah
,
''
said
the
count
,
watching
Andrea
's
countenance
,
*NL*
``
I
do
not
demand
any
confession
from
you
;
it
is
precisely
to
avoid
that
*NL*
necessity
that
your
father
was
sent
for
from
Lucca
.
You
shall
soon
*NL*
see
him
.
He
is
a
little
stiff
and
pompous
in
his
manner
,
and
he
is
*NL*
disfigured
by
his
uniform
;
but
when
it
becomes
known
that
he
has
been
*NL*
for
eighteen
years
in
the
Austrian
service
,
all
that
will
be
pardoned

*NL*
We
are
not
generally
very
severe
with
the
Austrians

In

you
will
*NL*
find
your

a
very
presentable
person

I
assure
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

sir

you
have
given
me
confidence

it
is
so
long
since
we
were
*NL*
separated
,
that
I
have
not
the
least
remembrance
of
him
,
and
,
besides
,
*NL*
you
know
that
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
a
large
fortune
covers
all
*NL*
defects
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
a
millionaire
--
his
income
is
500,000
francs
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,

said
the
young
man
,
with
anxiety
,
``
I
shall
be
sure
to
be
placed
*NL*
in
an
agreeable
position

*NL*
*NL*
``
One
of
the
most
agreeable
possible

my

he
will
allow
you
an

50,000
livres
per
annum
during
the
whole
time
of
your
stay
in
*NL*
Paris

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
in

always
choose

*NL*

control
circumstances

proposes

disposes

''
Andrea
sighed
.
``
But
,
''
said
he
,
``
so
long
as
I
do
remain
in
*NL*
Paris
,
and
nothing
forces
me
to
quit
it
,
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
I
*NL*
may
rely
on
receiving
the
sum
you
just
now
mentioned
to
me
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may

*NL*
*NL*

Andrea

with
some
uneasiness

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

you
will
receive
it
from
your
father
personally

but
Lord
Wilmore
*NL*
will
be
the
security
for
the
money
.
He
has
,
at
the
request
of
your
*NL*
father
,
opened
an
account
of
6,000

francs
a
month
at
M.
Danglars

,
*NL*
which
is
one
of
the
safest

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
does
my

mean
to
remain
long
in

asked
Andrea
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
a
few
days

replied
Monte
Cristo
.
``
His
service
does
not
allow
him
*NL*
to
absent
himself
more
than
two
or
three
weeks
together
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
my
dear
father
!
''
exclaimed
Andrea
,
evidently
charmed
with
the
idea
*NL*
of
his
speedy
departure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Therefore
,
''
said
Monte
Cristo
feigning
to
mistake
his
*NL*
meaning
--
``
therefore
I
will
not
,
for
another
instant
,
retard
the
pleasure
*NL*
of
your
meeting

Are
you
prepared

embrace
your
worthy

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
you
do
not

it

*NL*
*NL*
``
Go

then

into
the
drawing-room

my
young
friend

where
you
will
find
*NL*
your
father
awaiting
you
.
''
Andrea
made
a
low
bow
to
the
count
,
*NL*
and
entered
the
adjoining
room
.
Monte
Cristo
watched
him
till
he
*NL*
disappeared
,
and
then
touched
a
spring
in
a
panel
made
to
look
like
a
*NL*
picture
,
which
,
in
sliding
partly
from
the
frame
,
discovered
to
view
*NL*
a
small
opening
,
so
cleverly
contrived
that
it
revealed
all
that
was
*NL*
passing
in
the
drawing-room
now
occupied
by
Cavalcanti
and
Andrea
.
The
*NL*
young
man
closed
the
door
behind
him
,
and
advanced
towards
the
major
,
*NL*
who
had
risen
when
he
heard
steps
approaching
him
.
``
Ah
,
my
dear
father
!
''
*NL*
said
Andrea
in
a
loud
voice
,
in
order
that
the
count
might
hear
him
in
*NL*
the
next
room
,
``
is
it
really
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
do
,
my
dear
son
?
''
said
the
major
gravely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
After
so
many
years
of
painful
separation
,
''
said
Andrea
,
in
the
same
*NL*
tone
of
voice
,
and
glancing
towards
the
door
,
``
what
a
happiness
it
is
to
*NL*
meet
again
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
it
is
,
after
so
long
a
separation

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
not
embrace
me
,
sir
?
''
said
Andrea
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
wish
it
,
my
son

''
said
the
major
;
and
the
two
men
embraced
each
*NL*
other
after
the
fashion
of
actors
on
the
stage
;
that
is
to
say
,
each
*NL*
rested
his
head
on
the
other
's
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
we
are
once
more
reunited

said
Andrea
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Once
more

replied
the
major
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
more
to
be
separated

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
as
to
that
--
I
think
,
my
dear
son
,
you
must
be
by
this
time
so
*NL*
accustomed
to
France
as
to
look
upon
it
almost
as
a
second
country
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
fact
is
,
''
said
the
young
man
,
``
that
I
should
be
exceedingly
grieved
*NL*
to
leave
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
for
me

you
must
know
I

live
out

therefore
*NL*
I
shall
return
to
Italy
as
soon
as
I
can

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
before
you
leave
France

my

I
hope
you
will
put
me
*NL*
in

the
documents

will
be
necessary
to
prove
my
*NL*
descent

*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly

I
am
come
expressly
on

has
cost
me
much
*NL*
trouble

find
you

I
had
resolved
on
giving
them
into
your
hands
,
*NL*
and
if
I
had
to
recommence
my
search
,
it
would
occupy
all
the
few
*NL*
remaining
years
of
my

*NL*
*NL*
``
Where

these
papers

*NL*
*NL*
``
Here

*NL*
*NL*
Andrea
seized
the
certificate
of
his
father
's
marriage
and
his
own
*NL*
baptismal
register
,
and
after
having
opened
them
with
all
the
eagerness
*NL*
which
might
be
expected
under
the
circumstances
,
he
read
them
with
a
*NL*
facility
which
proved
that
he
was
accustomed
to
similar
documents
,
and
*NL*
with
an
expression
which
plainly
denoted
an
unusual
interest
in
the
*NL*
contents
.
When
he
had
perused
the
documents
,
an
indefinable
expression
*NL*
of
pleasure
lighted
up
his
countenance
,
and
looking
at
the
major
with
a
*NL*
most
peculiar
smile
,
he
said
,
in
very
excellent
Tuscan
,
--
``
Then
there
is
*NL*
no
longer
any
such
thing
,
in
Italy
as
being
condemned
to
the
galleys

*NL*
The
major
drew
himself
up
to
his
full
height
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
--
what
do
you
mean
by
that
question

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
mean
that

impunity
two
such

these
.
In

my
dear
sir

half
such
a
*NL*
piece
of
effrontery
as
that

cause
you

be
quickly
despatched

five
years
,
for
change
of
air

*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
be
good
enough
to
explain
your

said
the
major
,
*NL*
endeavoring
as
much
as
possible
to
assume
an
air
of
the
greatest
*NL*
majesty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My

M.
Cavalcanti

said
Andrea
,
taking
the
major
by
the
arm
in
a
*NL*
confidential
manner
,
``
how
much
are
you
paid

The
*NL*
major
was
about
to
speak

Andrea
continued
,
in
a
low
voice

*NL*
*NL*
``
Nonsense

can
understand

likely

ever
deny

The
major
*NL*
looked
anxiously
around
him
.
``
Make
yourself
easy

we
are
quite
alone

Andrea

*NL*
``

drew
from
his
pocket
a

No

Monte
Cristo
chose
this
moment
for
*NL*
re-entering
the
drawing-room
.
On
hearing
the
sound
of
his
footsteps
,
the
*NL*
two
men
threw
themselves
in
each
other
's
arms
,
and
while
they
were
in
*NL*
the
midst
of
this
embrace
,
the
count
entered
.
``
Well

Monte

you

``
At

bowed
to

left

Monte

went
to

window

saw
them
crossing

street

arm

arm

``
There
go
two

he
,
``
it

after
an

instant
of
gloomy
reflection
,
``
Come

go

Chapter
57
.
In
the
Lucerne
Patch
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
readers
must
now
allow
us
to
transport
them
again
to
the
enclosure
*NL*
surrounding
M.
de
Villefort
's
house
,
and
,
behind
the
gate
,
half
screened
*NL*
from
view
by
the
large
chestnut-trees
,
which
on
all
sides
spread
their
*NL*
luxuriant
branches
,
we
shall
find
some
people
of
our
acquaintance
.
This
*NL*
time
Maximilian
was
the
first
to
arrive
.
He
was
intently
watching
for
a
*NL*
shadow
to
appear
among
the
trees
,
and
awaiting
with
anxiety
the
sound
of
*NL*
a
light
step
on
the
gravel
walk
.
At
length
,
the
long-desired
sound
was
*NL*
heard
,
and
instead
of
one
figure
,
as
he
had
expected
,
he
perceived
that
*NL*
two
were
approaching
him
.
The
delay
had
been
occasioned
by
a
visit
from
*NL*
Madame
Danglars
and
Eugenie
,
which
had
been
prolonged
beyond
the
time
at
*NL*
which
Valentine
was
expected
.
That
she
might
not
appear
to
fail
in
her
*NL*
promise
to
Maximilian
,
she
proposed
to
Mademoiselle
Danglars
that
they
*NL*
should
take
a
walk
in
the
garden
,
being
anxious
to
show
that
the
delay
,
*NL*
which
was
doubtless
a
cause
of
vexation
to
him
,
was
not
occasioned
by
*NL*
any
neglect
on
her
part
.
The
young
man
,
with
the
intuitive
perception
*NL*
of
a
lover
,
quickly
understood
the
circumstances
in
which
she
was
*NL*
involuntarily
placed
,
and
he
was
comforted
.
Besides
,
although
she
*NL*
avoided
coming
within
speaking
distance
,
Valentine
arranged
so
that
*NL*
Maximilian
could
see
her
pass
and
repass
,
and
each
time
she
went
by
,
she
*NL*
managed
,
unperceived
by
her
companion
,
to
cast
an
expressive
look
at
*NL*
the
young
man
,
which
seemed
to
say
,
``
Have
patience
!
You
see
it
is
not
*NL*
my
fault
.
''
And
Maximilian
was
patient
,
and
employed
himself
in
mentally
*NL*
contrasting
the
two
girls
,
--
one
fair
,
with
soft
languishing
eyes
,
a
*NL*
figure
gracefully
bending
like
a
weeping
willow
;
the
other
a
brunette
,
*NL*
with
a
fierce
and
haughty
expression
,
and
as
straight
as
a
poplar
.
It
is
*NL*
unnecessary
to
state
that
,
in
the
eyes
of
the
young
man
,
Valentine
did
*NL*
not
suffer
by
the
contrast
.
In
about
half
an
hour
the
girls
went
away
,
*NL*
and
Maximilian
understood
that
Mademoiselle
Danglars
'
visit
had
at
last
*NL*
come
to
an
end
.
In
a
few
minutes
Valentine
re-entered
the
garden
alone
.
*NL*
For
fear
that
any
one
should
be
observing
her
return
,
she
walked
slowly
;
*NL*
and
instead
of
immediately
directing
her
steps
towards
the
gate
,
she
*NL*
seated
herself
on
a
bench
,
and
,
carefully
casting
her
eyes
around
,
to
*NL*
convince
herself
that
she
was
not
watched
,
she
presently
arose
,
and
*NL*
proceeded
quickly
to
join
Maximilian
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-evening
,
Valentine
,
''
said
a
well-known
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-evening
,
Maximilian
;
I
know
I
have
kept
you
waiting
,
but
you
saw
*NL*
the
cause
of
my
delay
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
recognized
Mademoiselle
Danglars
.
I
was
not
aware
that
you
were
*NL*
so
intimate
with
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
told
you
we
were
intimate
,
Maximilian
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
one
,
but
you
appeared
to
be
so
.
From
the
manner
in
which
you
walked
*NL*
and
talked
together
,
one
would
have
thought
you
were
two
school-girls
*NL*
telling
your
secrets
to
each
other
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
were
having
a
confidential
conversation
,
''
returned
Valentine
;
``
she
*NL*
was
owning
to
me
her
repugnance
to
the
marriage
with
M.
de
Morcerf
;
and
*NL*
I
,
on
the
other
hand
,
was
confessing
to
her
how
wretched
it
made
me
to
*NL*
think
of
marrying
M.
d'Epinay
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
Valentine
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
will
account
to
you
for
the
unreserved
manner
which
you
observed
*NL*
between
me
and
Eugenie
,
as
in
speaking
of
the
man
whom
I
could
not
love
,
*NL*
my
thoughts
involuntarily
reverted
to
him
on
whom
my
affections
were
*NL*
fixed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
how
good
you
are
to
say
so
,
Valentine
!
You
possess
a
quality
which
*NL*
can
never
belong
to
Mademoiselle
Danglars
.
It
is
that
indefinable
charm
*NL*
which
is
to
a
woman
what
perfume
is
to
the
flower
and
flavor
to
the
*NL*
fruit
,
for
the
beauty
of
either
is
not
the
only
quality
we
seek
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
your
love
which
makes
you
look
upon
everything
in
that
light
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Valentine
,
I
assure
you
such
is
not
the
case
.
I
was
observing
you
*NL*
both
when
you
were
walking
in
the
garden
,
and
,
on
my
honor
,
without
at
*NL*
all
wishing
to
depreciate
the
beauty
of
Mademoiselle
Danglars
,
I
can
not
*NL*
understand
how
any
man
can
really
love
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
fact
is
,
Maximilian
,
that
I
was
there
,
and
my
presence
had
the
*NL*
effect
of
rendering
you
unjust
in
your
comparison
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
but
tell
me
--
it
is
a
question
of
simple
curiosity
,
and
which
was
*NL*
suggested
by
certain
ideas
passing
in
my
mind
relative
to
Mademoiselle
*NL*
Danglars

--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
dare
say
it
is
something
disparaging
which
you
are
going
to
say

*NL*
It
only
proves
how
little
indulgence
we
may
expect
from
your
sex
,
''
*NL*
interrupted
Valentine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
not
,
at
least
,
deny
that
you
are
very
harsh
judges
of
each
*NL*
other
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
we
are
so
,
it
is
because
we
generally
judge
under
the
influence
of
*NL*
excitement
.
But
return
to
your
question
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
Mademoiselle
Danglars
object
to
this
marriage
with
M.
de
Morcerf
*NL*
on
account
of
loving
another
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
told
you
I
was
not
on
terms
of
strict
intimacy
with
Eugenie
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
girls
tell
each
other
secrets

being
particularly

intimate

own
,
now
,
that
you
did
question
her
on
the
subject

Ah
,
I
see
*NL*
you
are
smiling

*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
are
already
aware

the
conversation

passed

the
wooden

partition

interposed
between

has
proved
but
a
slight

security

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come

what
did
she
say

*NL*
*NL*
``
She
told
me
that

loved
no

said
Valentine
;
``
that
she
disliked

the
idea

being
married

that
she
would
infinitely
prefer
leading
an
*NL*
independent

unfettered
life

that
she
almost
wished
her
father

might
lose
his
fortune

she
might
become
an
artist

like
her

``
You
do
not
understand
me
,
Maximilian
.
About
a
year
ago
,
I
talked
of
*NL*
retiring
to
a
convent
.
Madame
de
Villefort
,
in
spite
of
all
the
remarks
*NL*
which
she
considered
it
her
duty
to
make
,
secretly
approved
of
the
*NL*
proposition
,
my
father
consented
to
it
at
her
instigation
,
and
it
was
*NL*
only
on
account
of
my
poor
grandfather
that
I
finally
abandoned
the
*NL*
project
.
You
can
form
no
idea
of
the
expression
of
that
old
man
's
eye
*NL*
when
he
looks
at
me
,
the
only
person
in
the
world
whom
he
loves
,
and
,
*NL*
I
had
almost
said
,
by
whom
he
is
beloved
in
return
.
When
he
learned
my
*NL*
resolution
,
I
shall
never
forget
the
reproachful
look
which
he
cast
*NL*
on
me
,
and
the
tears
of
utter
despair
which
chased
each
other
down
his
*NL*
lifeless
cheeks
.
Ah
,
Maximilian
,
I
experienced
,
at
that
moment
,
*NL*
such
remorse
for
my
intention
,
that
,
throwing
myself
at
his
feet
,
I
*NL*
exclaimed
,
--
`
Forgive
me
,
pray
forgive
me
,
my
dear
grandfather
;
they
may
*NL*
do
what
they
will
with
me
,
I
will
never
leave
you
.
'
When
I
had
ceased
*NL*
speaking
,
he
thankfully
raised
his
eyes
to
heaven
,
but
without
uttering
*NL*
a
word
.
Ah
,
Maximilian
,
I
may
have
much
to
suffer
,
but
I
feel
as
if
my
*NL*
grandfather
's
look
at
that
moment
would
more
than
compensate
for
all
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear

Bedouins

can
have
done
to
*NL*
merit

being
revealed
to

indeed
,
heaven
took
into
*NL*
consideration

fact
that
the
victims
of
my
sword
were
infidels
.
But
*NL*
tell
me
what
interest
Madame

can
have
in
your
remaining
*NL*
unmarried
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
I
not
tell
you
just
now

I

I

50,000

my

therefore

Now

had
taken
the

all
this

have
descended

diplomatically
--
that
is
to
say
,
*NL*
like
a
man
who
wishes
,
by
some
means
or
other
,
to
obtain
a
footing
in
*NL*
the
house
,
so
that
he
may
ultimately
gain
the
power
of
dictating
to
its
*NL*
occupants
--
he
would
,
if
it
had
been
but
once
,
have
honored
me
with
the
*NL*
smile
which
you
extol
so
loudly
;
but
no
,
he
saw
that
I
was
unhappy
,
*NL*
he
understood
that
I
could
be
of
no
use
to
him
,
and
therefore
paid
no
*NL*
attention
to
me
whatever
.
Who
knows
but
that
,
in
order
to
please
Madame
*NL*
de
Villefort
and
my
father
,
he
may
not
persecute
me
by
every
means
in
*NL*
his
power
?
It
is
not
just
that
he
should
despise
me
so
,
without
any
*NL*
reason
.
Ah
,
forgive
me
,
''
said
Valentine
,
perceiving
the
effect
which
her
*NL*
words
were
producing
on
Maximilian
:
``
I
have
done
wrong
,
for
I
have
given
*NL*
utterance
to
thoughts
concerning
that
man
which
I
did
not
even
know
*NL*
existed
in
my
heart
.
I
do
not
deny
the
influence
of
which
you
speak
,
*NL*
or
that
I
have
not
myself
experienced
it
,
but
with
me
it
has
been
*NL*
productive
of
evil
rather
than
good
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Valentine
,
''
said
Morrel
with
a
sigh
,
``
we
will
not
discuss
the
*NL*
matter
further
.
I
will
not
make
a
confidant
of
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas
,
''
said
Valentine
,
``
I
see
that
I
have
given
you
pain
.
I
can
only
*NL*
say
how
sincerely
I
ask
pardon
for
having
griefed
you
.
But
,
indeed
,
I
am
*NL*
not
prejudiced
beyond
the
power
of
conviction
.
Tell
me
what
this
Count
*NL*
of
Monte
Cristo
has
done
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
own
that
your
question
embarrasses
me
,
Valentine
,
for
I
can
not
say
*NL*
that
the
count
has
rendered
me
any
ostensible
service
.
Still
,
as
I
have
*NL*
already
told
you
I
have
an
instinctive
affection
for
him
,
the
source
of
*NL*
which
I
can
not
explain
to
you
.
Has
the
sun
done
anything
for
me
?
No
;
he
*NL*
warms
me
with
his
rays
,
and
it
is
by
his
light
that
I
see
you
--
nothing
*NL*
more
.
Has
such
and
such
a
perfume
done
anything
for
me
?
No
;
its
odor
*NL*
charms
one
of
my
senses
--
that
is
all
I
can
say
when
I
am
asked
why
I
*NL*
praise
it
.
My
friendship
for
him
is
as
strange
and
unaccountable
as
*NL*
his
for
me
.
A
secret
voice
seems
to
whisper
to
me
that
there
must
be
*NL*
something
more
than
chance
in
this
unexpected
reciprocity
of
friendship
.
*NL*
In
his
most
simple
actions
,
as
well
as
in
his
most
secret
thoughts
,
I
*NL*
find
a
relation
to
my
own
.
You
will
perhaps
smile
at
me
when
I
tell
you
*NL*
that
,
ever
since
I
have
known
this
man
,
I
have
involuntarily
entertained
*NL*
the
idea
that
all
the
good
fortune
which
has
befallen
me
originated
*NL*
from
him
.
However
,
I
have
managed
to
live
thirty
years
without
this
*NL*
protection
,
you
will
say
;
but
I
will
endeavor
a
little
to
illustrate
my
*NL*
meaning
.
He
invited
me
to
dine
with
him
on
Saturday
,
which
was
a
very
*NL*
natural
thing
for
him
to
do
.
Well
,
what
have
I
learned
since
?
That
your
*NL*
mother
and
M.
de
Villefort
are
both
coming
to
this
dinner
.
I
shall
meet
*NL*
them
there
,
and
who
knows
what
future
advantages
may
result
from
the
*NL*
interview
?
This
may
appear
to
you
to
be
no
unusual
combination
of
*NL*
circumstances
;
nevertheless
,
I
perceive
some
hidden
plot
in
the
*NL*
arrangement
--
something
,
in
fact
,
more
than
is
apparent
on
a
casual
view
*NL*
of
the
subject
.
I
believe
that
this
singular
man
,
who
appears
to
fathom
*NL*
the
motives
of
every
one
,
has
purposely
arranged
for
me
to
meet
M.
and
*NL*
Madame
de
Villefort
,
and
sometimes
,
I
confess
,
I
have
gone
so
far
as
to
*NL*
try
to
read
in
his
eyes
whether
he
was
in
possession
of
the
secret
of
*NL*
our
love
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
good
friend
,
''
said
Valentine
,
``
I
should
take
you
for
a
visionary
,
*NL*
and
should
tremble
for
your
reason
,
if
I
were
always
to
hear
you
talk
in
*NL*
a
strain
similar
to
this
.
Is
it
possible
that
you
can
see
anything
*NL*
more
than
the
merest
chance
in
this
meeting
?
Pray
reflect
a
little
.
*NL*
My
father
,
who
never
goes
out
,
has
several
times
been
on
the
point
*NL*
of
refusing
this
invitation
;
Madame
de
Villefort
,
on
the
contrary
,
is
*NL*
burning
with
the
desire
of
seeing
this
extraordinary
nabob
in
his
own
*NL*
house
,
therefore
,
she
has
with
great
difficulty
prevailed
on
my
father
*NL*
to
accompany
her
.
No
,
no
;
it
is
as
I
have
said
,
Maximilian
,
--
there
is
no
*NL*
one
in
the
world
of
whom
I
can
ask
help
but
yourself
and
my
grandfather
,
*NL*
who
is
little
better
than
a
corpse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
that
you
are
right
,
logically
speaking
,
''
said
Maximilian
;
``
but
*NL*
the
gentle
voice
which
usually
has
such
power
over
me
fails
to
convince
*NL*
me
to-day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
feel
the
same
as
regards
yourself
.
''
said
Valentine
;
``
and
I
own
that
,
*NL*
if
you
have
no
stronger
proof
to
give
me
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
another
,
''
replied
Maximilian
;
``
but
I
fear
you
will
deem
it
even
*NL*
more
absurd
than
the
first
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
much
the
worse
,
''
said
Valentine
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
,
nevertheless
,
conclusive
to
my
mind
.
My
ten
years
of
service
*NL*
have
also
confirmed
my
ideas
on
the
subject
of
sudden
inspirations
,
for
*NL*
I
have
several
times
owed
my
life
to
a
mysterious
impulse
which
directed
*NL*
me
to
move
at
once
either
to
the
right
or
to
the
left
,
in
order
to
*NL*
escape
the
ball
which
killed
the
comrade
fighting
by
my
side
,
while
it
*NL*
left
me
unharmed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
Maximilian
,
why
not
attribute
your
escape
to
my
constant
prayers
*NL*
for
your
safety
?
When
you
are
away
,
I
no
longer
pray
for
myself
,
but
for
*NL*
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
since
you
have
known
me

said
Morrel
,
smiling
;
``

that
can
not
*NL*
apply
to
the
time
previous
to
our
acquaintance

Valentine
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
very
provoking
,
and
will
not
give
me
credit
for
anything
;

*NL*
let
me
hear
this
second
proof
,
which
you
yourself
own
to
be
absurd
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
look
through
this
opening
,
and
you
will
see
the
beautiful
new
*NL*
horse
which
I
rode
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
what
a
beautiful
creature
!
''
cried
Valentine
;
``
why
did
you
not
bring
*NL*
him
close
to
the
gate
,
so
that
I
could
talk
to
him
and
pat
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
,
as
you
see
,
a
very
valuable
animal
,
''
said
Maximilian
.
``
You
know
*NL*
that
my
means
are
limited
,
and
that
I
am
what
would
be
designated
a
man
*NL*
of
moderate
pretensions
.
Well
,
I
went
to
a
horse
dealer
's
,
where
I
saw
*NL*
this
magnificent
horse
,
which
I
have
named
Medeah
.
I
asked
the
price
;
*NL*
they
told
me
it
was
4,500
francs
.
I
was
,
therefore
,
obliged
to
give
it
*NL*
up
,
as
you
may
imagine
,
but
I
own
I
went
away
with
rather
a
heavy
heart
,
*NL*
for
the
horse
had
looked
at
me
affectionately
,
had
rubbed
his
head
*NL*
against
me
and
,
when
I
mounted
him
,
had
pranced
in
the
most
delightful
*NL*
way
imaginable
,
so
that
I
was
altogether
fascinated
with
him
.
The
same
*NL*
evening
some
friends
of
mine
visited
me
,
--
M.
de
Chateau-Renaud
,
M.
*NL*
Debray
,
and
five
or
six
other
choice
spirits
,
whom
you
do
not
know
,
even
*NL*
by
name
.
They
proposed
a
game
of
bouillotte
.
I
never
play
,
for
I
am
not
*NL*
rich
enough
to
afford
to
lose
,
or
sufficiently
poor
to
desire
to
gain
.
*NL*
But
I
was
at
my
own
house
,
you
understand
,
so
there
was
nothing
to
be
*NL*
done
but
to
send
for
the
cards
,
which
I
did
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
as
they
were
sitting
down
to
table
,
M.
de
Monte
Cristo
arrived
.
He
*NL*
took
his
seat
amongst
them
;
they
played
,
and
I
won
.
I
am
almost
ashamed
*NL*
to
say
that
my
gains
amounted
to
5,000
francs
.
We
separated
at
midnight
.
*NL*
I
could
not
defer
my
pleasure
,
so
I
took
a
cabriolet
and
drove
to
the
*NL*
horse
dealer
's
.
Feverish
and
excited
,
I
rang
at
the
door
.
The
person
who
*NL*
opened
it
must
have
taken
me
for
a
madman
,
for
I
rushed
at
once
to
the
*NL*
stable
.
Medeah
was
standing
at
the
rack
,
eating
his
hay
.
I
immediately
*NL*
put
on
the
saddle
and
bridle
,
to
which
operation
he
lent
himself
with
*NL*
the
best
grace
possible
;
then
,
putting
the
4,500
francs
into
the
hands
*NL*
of
the
astonished
dealer
,
I
proceeded
to
fulfil
my
intention
of
passing
*NL*
the
night
in
riding
in
the
Champs
Elysees
.
As
I
rode
by
the
count
's
*NL*
house
I
perceived
a
light
in
one
of
the
windows
,
and
fancied
I
saw
the
*NL*
shadow
of
his
figure
moving
behind
the
curtain
.
Now
,
Valentine
,
I
firmly
*NL*
believe
that
he
knew
of
my
wish
to
possess
this
horse
,
and
that
he
lost
*NL*
expressly
to
give
me
the
means
of
procuring
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Maximilian
,
you
are
really
too
fanciful
;
you
will
not
love
even
*NL*
me
long
.
A
man
who
accustoms
himself
to
live
in
such
a
world
of
poetry
*NL*
and
imagination
must
find
far
too
little
excitement
in
a
common
,
*NL*
every-day
sort
of
attachment
such
as
ours
.
But
they
are
calling
me
.
Do
*NL*
you
hear
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
Valentine
,
''
said
Maximilian
,
``
give
me
but
one
finger
through
this
*NL*
opening
in
the
grating
,
one
finger
,
the
littlest
finger
of
all
,
that
I
*NL*
may
have
the
happiness
of
kissing
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Maximilian
,
we
said
we
would
be
to
each
other
as
two
voices
,
two
*NL*
shadows
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
you
will
,
Valentine

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
you
be
happy
if
I
do
what
you
wish
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
!
''
Valentine
mounted
on
a
bench
,
and
passed
not
only
her
finger
*NL*
but
her
whole
hand
through
the
opening
.
Maximilian
uttered
a
cry
of
*NL*
delight
,
and
,
springing
forwards
,
seized
the
hand
extended
towards
him
,
*NL*
and
imprinted
on
it
a
fervent
and
impassioned
kiss
.
The
little
hand
was
*NL*
then
immediately
withdrawn
,
and
the
young
man
saw
Valentine
hurrying
*NL*
towards
the
house
,
as
though
she
were
almost
terrified
at
her
own
*NL*
sensations

Chapter
58
.
M.
Noirtier
de
Villefort
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
will
now
relate
what
was
passing
in
the
house
of
the
king
's
attorney
*NL*
after
the
departure
of
Madame
Danglars
and
her
daughter
,
and
during
the
*NL*
time
of
the
conversation
between
Maximilian
and
Valentine
,
which
we
have
*NL*
just
detailed
.
M.
de
Villefort
entered
his
father
's
room
,
followed
by
*NL*
Madame
de
Villefort
.
Both
of
the
visitors
,
after
saluting
the
old
man
*NL*
and
speaking
to
Barrois
,
a
faithful
servant
,
who
had
been
twenty-five
*NL*
years
in
his
service
,
took
their
places
on
either
side
of
the
paralytic
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Noirtier
was
sitting
in
an
arm-chair
,
which
moved
upon
casters
,
in
*NL*
which
he
was
wheeled
into
the
room
in
the
morning
,
and
in
the
same
way
*NL*
drawn
out
again
at
night
.
He
was
placed
before
a
large
glass
,
which
*NL*
reflected
the
whole
apartment
,
and
so
,
without
any
attempt
to
move
,
*NL*
which
would
have
been
impossible
,
he
could
see
all
who
entered
the
room
*NL*
and
everything
which
was
going
on
around
him
.
M.
Noirtier
,
although
*NL*
almost
as
immovable
as
a
corpse
,
looked
at
the
new-comers
with
a
quick
*NL*
and
intelligent
expression
,
perceiving
at
once
,
by
their
ceremonious
*NL*
courtesy
,
that
they
were
come
on
business
of
an
unexpected
and
official
*NL*
character
.
Sight
and
hearing
were
the
only
senses
remaining
,
and
they
,
*NL*
like
two
solitary
sparks
,
remained
to
animate
the
miserable
body
which
*NL*
seemed
fit
for
nothing
but
the
grave
;
it
was
only
,
however
,
by
means
of
*NL*
one
of
these
senses
that
he
could
reveal
the
thoughts
and
feelings
that
*NL*
still
occupied
his
mind
,
and
the
look
by
which
he
gave
expression
to
his
*NL*
inner
life
was
like
the
distant
gleam
of
a
candle
which
a
traveller
sees
*NL*
by
night
across
some
desert
place
,
and
knows
that
a
living
being
dwells
*NL*
beyond
the
silence
and
obscurity
.
Noirtier
's
hair
was
long
and
white
,
*NL*
and
flowed
over
his
shoulders
;
while
in
his
eyes
,
shaded
by
thick
black
*NL*
lashes
,
was
concentrated
,
as
it
often
happens
with
an
organ
which
is
*NL*
used
to
the
exclusion
of
the
others
,
all
the
activity
,
address
,
force
,
*NL*
and
intelligence
which
were
formerly
diffused
over
his
whole
body
;
and
*NL*
so
although
the
movement
of
the
arm
,
the
sound
of
the
voice
,
and
the
*NL*
agility
of
the
body
,
were
wanting
,
the
speaking
eye
sufficed
for
all
.
*NL*
He
commanded
with
it
;
it
was
the
medium
through
which
his
thanks
were
*NL*
conveyed
.
In
short
,
his
whole
appearance
produced
on
the
mind
the
*NL*
impression
of
a
corpse
with
living
eyes
,
and
nothing
could
be
more
*NL*
startling
than
to
observe
the
expression
of
anger
or
joy
suddenly
*NL*
lighting
up
these
organs
,
while
the
rest
of
the
rigid
and
marble-like
*NL*
features
were
utterly
deprived
of
the
power
of
participation
.
Three
*NL*
persons
only
could
understand
this
language
of
the
poor
paralytic
;
these
*NL*
were
Villefort
,
Valentine
,
and
the
old
servant
of
whom
we
have
already
*NL*
spoken
.
But
as
Villefort
saw
his
father
but
seldom
,
and
then
only
when
*NL*
absolutely
obliged
,
and
as
he
never
took
any
pains
to
please
or
gratify
*NL*
him
when
he
was
there
,
all
the
old
man
's
happiness
was
centred
in
his
*NL*
granddaughter
.
Valentine
,
by
means
of
her
love
,
her
patience
,
and
her
*NL*
devotion
,
had
learned
to
read
in
Noirtier
's
look
all
the
varied
feelings
*NL*
which
were
passing
in
his
mind
.
To
this
dumb
language
,
which
was
so
*NL*
unintelligible
to
others
,
she
answered
by
throwing
her
whole
soul
*NL*
into
the
expression
of
her
countenance
,
and
in
this
manner
were
the
*NL*
conversations
sustained
between
the
blooming
girl
and
the
helpless
*NL*
invalid
,
whose
body
could
scarcely
be
called
a
living
one
,
but
who
,
*NL*
nevertheless
,
possessed
a
fund
of
knowledge
and
penetration
,
united
with
*NL*
a
will
as
powerful
as
ever
although
clogged
by
a
body
rendered
utterly
*NL*
incapable
of
obeying
its
impulses
.
Valentine
had
solved
the
problem
,
*NL*
and
was
able
easily
to
understand
his
thoughts
,
and
to
convey
her
own
in
*NL*
return
,
and
,
through
her
untiring
and
devoted
assiduity
,
it
was
seldom
*NL*
that
,
in
the
ordinary
transactions
of
every-day
life
,
she
failed
to
*NL*
anticipate
the
wishes
of
the
living
,
thinking
mind
,
or
the
wants
of
the
*NL*
almost
inanimate
body
.
As
to
the
servant
,
he
had
,
as
we
have
said
,
been
*NL*
with
his
master
for
five
and
twenty
years
,
therefore
he
knew
all
his
*NL*
habits
,
and
it
was
seldom
that
Noirtier
found
it
necessary
to
ask
for
*NL*
anything
,
so
prompt
was
he
in
administering
to
all
the
necessities
of
*NL*
the
invalid
.
Villefort
did
not
need
the
help
of
either
Valentine
or
the
*NL*
domestic
in
order
to
carry
on
with
his
father
the
strange
conversation
*NL*
which
he
was
about
to
begin
.
As
we
have
said
,
he
perfectly
understood
*NL*
the
old
man
's
vocabulary
,
and
if
he
did
not
use
it
more
often
,
it
*NL*
was
only
indifference
and
ennui
which
prevented
him
from
so
doing
.
He
*NL*
therefore
allowed
Valentine
to
go
into
the
garden
,
sent
away
Barrois
,
*NL*
and
after
having
seated
himself
at
his
father
's
right
hand
,
while
Madame
*NL*
de
Villefort
placed
herself
on
the
left
,
he
addressed
him
thus
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
trust
you
will
not
be
displeased
,
sir
,
that
Valentine
has
not
come
*NL*
with
us
,
or
that
I
dismissed
Barrois
,
for
our
conference
will
be
one
*NL*
which
could
not
with
propriety
be
carried
on
in
the
presence
of
either
.
*NL*
Madame
de
Villefort
and
I
have
a
communication
to
make
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Noirtier
's
face
remained
perfectly
passive
during
this
long
preamble
,
*NL*
while
,
on
the
contrary
,
Villefort
's
eye
was
endeavoring
to
penetrate
*NL*
into
the
inmost
recesses
of
the
old
man
's
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
communication
,
''
continued
the
procureur
,
in
that
cold
and
decisive
*NL*
tone
which
seemed
at
once
to
preclude
all
discussion
,
``
will
,
we
are
*NL*
sure
,
meet
with
your
approbation
.
''
The
eye
of
the
invalid
still
retained
*NL*
that
vacancy
of
expression
which
prevented
his
son
from
obtaining
any
*NL*
knowledge
of
the
feelings
which
were
passing
in
his
mind
;
he
listened
,
*NL*
nothing
more
.
``
Sir
,
''
resumed
Villefort
,
``
we
are
thinking
of
marrying
*NL*
Valentine
.
''
Had
the
old
man
's
face
been
moulded
in
wax
it
could
not
have
*NL*
shown
less
emotion
at
this
news
than
was
now
to
be
traced
there
.
``
The
*NL*
marriage
will
take
place
in
less
than
three
months
,
''
said
Villefort
.
*NL*
Noirtier
's
eye
still
retained
its
inanimate
expression
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Villefort
now
took
her
part
in
the
conversation
and
*NL*
added
,
--
``
We
thought
this
news
would
possess
an
interest
for
you
,
*NL*
sir
,
who
have
always
entertained
a
great
affection
for
Valentine
;
it
*NL*
therefore
only
now
remains
for
us
to
tell
you
the
name
of
the
young
man
*NL*
for
whom
she
is
destined
.
It
is
one
of
the
most
desirable
connections
*NL*
which
could
possibly
be
formed
;
he
possesses
fortune
,
a
high
rank
in
*NL*
society
,
and
every
personal
qualification
likely
to
render
Valentine
*NL*
supremely
happy
,
--
his
name
,
moreover
,
can
not
be
wholly
unknown
to
you
.
*NL*
It
is
M.
Franz
de
Quesnel
,
Baron
d'Epinay
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
his
wife
was
speaking
,
Villefort
had
narrowly
watched
the
old
*NL*
man
's
countenance
.
When
Madame
de
Villefort
pronounced
the
name
of
*NL*
Franz
,
the
pupil
of
M.
Noirtier
's
eye
began
to
dilate
,
and
his
eyelids
*NL*
trembled
with
the
same
movement
that
may
be
perceived
on
the
lips
of
an
*NL*
individual
about
to
speak
,
and
he
darted
a
lightning
glance
at
Madame
*NL*
de
Villefort
and
his
son
.
The
procureur
,
who
knew
the
political
hatred
*NL*
which
had
formerly
existed
between
M.
Noirtier
and
the
elder
d'Epinay
,
*NL*
well
understood
the
agitation
and
anger
which
the
announcement
had
*NL*
produced
;
but
,
feigning
not
to
perceive
either
,
he
immediately
resumed
*NL*
the
narrative
begun
by
his
wife
.
``
Sir
,
''
said
he
,
``
you
are
aware
that
*NL*
Valentine
is
about
to
enter
her
nineteenth
year
,
which
renders
it
*NL*
important
that
she
should
lose
no
time
in
forming
a
suitable
alliance
.
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
you
have
not
been
forgotten
in
our
plans
,
and
we
have
*NL*
fully
ascertained
beforehand
that
Valentine
's
future
husband
will
*NL*
consent
,
not
to
live
in
this
house
,
for
that
might
not
be
pleasant
for
*NL*
the
young
people
,
but
that
you
should
live
with
them
;
so
that
you
and
*NL*
Valentine
,
who
are
so
attached
to
each
other
,
would
not
be
separated
,
*NL*
and
you
would
be
able
to
pursue
exactly
the
same
course
of
life
which
*NL*
you
have
hitherto
done
,
and
thus
,
instead
of
losing
,
you
will
be
a
*NL*
gainer
by
the
change
,
as
it
will
secure
to
you
two
children
instead
of
*NL*
one
,
to
watch
over
and
comfort
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Noirtier
's
look
was
furious
;
it
was
very
evident
that
something
*NL*
desperate
was
passing
in
the
old
man
's
mind
,
for
a
cry
of
anger
and
*NL*
grief
rose
in
his
throat
,
and
not
being
able
to
find
vent
in
utterance
,
*NL*
appeared
almost
to
choke
him
,
for
his
face
and
lips
turned
quite
purple
*NL*
with
the
struggle
.
Villefort
quietly
opened
a
window
,
saying
,
``
It
is
*NL*
very
warm
,
and
the
heat
affects
M.
Noirtier
.
''
He
then
returned
to
his
*NL*
place
,
but
did
not
sit
down
.
``
This
marriage
,
''
added
Madame
de
Villefort
,
*NL*
``
is
quite
agreeable
to
the
wishes
of
M.
d'Epinay
and
his
family
;
*NL*
besides
,
he
had
no
relations
nearer
than
an
uncle
and
aunt
,
his
mother
*NL*
having
died
at
his
birth
,
and
his
father
having
been
assassinated
*NL*
in
1815
,
that
is
to
say
,
when
he
was
but
two
years
old
;
it
naturally
*NL*
followed
that
the
child
was
permitted
to
choose
his
own
pursuits
,
and
he
*NL*
has
,
therefore
,
seldom
acknowledged
any
other
authority
but
that
of
his
*NL*
own
will
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
assassination
was
a
mysterious
affair
,
''
said
Villefort
,
``
and
the
*NL*
perpetrators
have
hitherto
escaped
detection
,
although
suspicion
has
*NL*
fallen
on
the
head
of
more
than
one
person
.
''
Noirtier
made
such
an
*NL*
effort
that
his
lips
expanded
into
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
''
continued
Villefort
,
``
those
to
whom
the
guilt
really
belongs
,
*NL*
by
whom
the
crime
was
committed
,
on
whose
heads
the
justice
of
man
may
*NL*
probably
descend
here
,
and
the
certain
judgment
of
God
hereafter
,
*NL*
would
rejoice
in
the
opportunity
thus
afforded
of
bestowing
such
*NL*
a
peace-offering
as
Valentine
on
the
son
of
him
whose
life
they
so
*NL*
ruthlessly
destroyed
.
''
Noirtier
had
succeeded
in
mastering
his
emotion
*NL*
more
than
could
have
been
deemed
possible
with
such
an
enfeebled
and
*NL*
shattered
frame
.
``
Yes
,
I
understand
,
''
was
the
reply
contained
in
his
*NL*
look
;
and
this
look
expressed
a
feeling
of
strong
indignation
,
mixed
*NL*
with
profound
contempt
.
Villefort
fully
understood
his
father
's
meaning
,
*NL*
and
answered
by
a
slight
shrug
of
his
shoulders
.
He
then
motioned
to
his
*NL*
wife
to
take
leave
.
``
Now
sir
,
''
said
Madame
de
Villefort
,
``
I
must
bid
you
*NL*
farewell
.
Would
you
like
me
to
send
Edward
to
you
for
a
short
time
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
had
been
agreed
that
the
old
man
should
express
his
approbation
by
*NL*
closing
his
eyes
,
his
refusal
by
winking
them
several
times
,
and
if
he
*NL*
had
some
desire
or
feeling
to
express
,
he
raised
them
to
heaven
.
If
*NL*
he
wanted
Valentine
,
he
closed
his
right
eye
only
,
and
if
Barrois
,
the
*NL*
left
.
At
Madame
de
Villefort
's
proposition
he
instantly
winked
his
eyes
.
*NL*
Provoked
by
a
complete
refusal
,
she
bit
her
lip
and
said
,
``
Then
shall
*NL*
I
send
Valentine
to
you
?
''
The
old
man
closed
his
eyes
eagerly
,
thereby
*NL*
intimating
that
such
was
his
wish
.
M.
and
Madame
de
Villefort
bowed
and
*NL*
left
the
room
,
giving
orders
that
Valentine
should
be
summoned
to
her
*NL*
grandfather
's
presence
,
and
feeling
sure
that
she
would
have
much
to
do
*NL*
to
restore
calmness
to
the
perturbed
spirit
of
the
invalid
.
Valentine
,
*NL*
with
a
color
still
heightened
by
emotion
,
entered
the
room
just
after
*NL*
her
parents
had
quitted
it
.
One
look
was
sufficient
to
tell
her
that
her
*NL*
grandfather
was
suffering
,
and
that
there
was
much
on
his
mind
which
he
*NL*
was
wishing
to
communicate
to
her
.
``
Dear
grandpapa
,
''
cried
she
,
``
what
*NL*
has
happened
?
They
have
vexed
you
,
and
you
are
angry
?
''
The
paralytic
*NL*
closed
his
eyes
in
token
of
assent
.
``
Who
has
displeased
you
?
Is
it
my
*NL*
father
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madame
de
Villefort
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Me
?
''
The
former
sign
was
repeated
.
``
Are
you
displeased
with
me
?
''
cried
*NL*
Valentine
in
astonishment
.
M.
Noirtier
again
closed
his
eyes
.
``
And
what
*NL*
have
I
done
,
dear
grandpapa
,
that
you
should
be
angry
with
me
?
''
cried
*NL*
Valentine
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
answer
,
and
she
continued
.
``
I
have
not
seen
you
all
day
.
*NL*
Has
any
one
been
speaking
to
you
against
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
the
old
man
's
look
,
with
eagerness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
think
a
moment
.
I
do
assure
you
,
grandpapa
--
Ah
--
M.
and
Madame
de
*NL*
Villefort
have
just
left
this
room
,
have
they
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
it
was
they
who
told
you
something
which
made
you
angry
?
What
*NL*
was
it
then
?
May
I
go
and
ask
them
,
that
I
may
have
the
opportunity
of
*NL*
making
my
peace
with
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
''
said
Noirtier
's
look
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
you
frighten
me
.
What
can
they
have
said
?
''
and
she
again
tried
to
*NL*
think
what
it
could
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
I
know
,
''
said
she
,
lowering
her
voice
and
going
close
to
the
old
*NL*
man
.
``
They
have
been
speaking
of
my
marriage
,
--
have
they
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
replied
the
angry
look
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
understand
;
you
are
displeased
at
the
silence
I
have
preserved
on
the
*NL*
subject
.
The
reason
of
it
was
,
that
they
had
insisted
on
my
keeping
the
*NL*
matter
a
secret
,
and
begged
me
not
to
tell
you
anything
of
it
.
They
did
*NL*
not
even
acquaint
me
with
their
intentions
,
and
I
only
discovered
them
*NL*
by
chance
,
that
is
why
I
have
been
so
reserved
with
you
,
dear
grandpapa
.
*NL*
Pray
forgive
me
.
''
But
there
was
no
look
calculated
to
reassure
her
;
all
*NL*
it
seemed
to
say
was
,
``
It
is
not
only
your
reserve
which
afflicts
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
,
then
?
''
asked
the
young
girl
.
``
Perhaps
you
think
I
shall
*NL*
abandon
you
,
dear
grandpapa
,
and
that
I
shall
forget
you
when
I
am
*NL*
married
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
told
you
,
then
,
that
M.
d'Epinay
consented
to
our
all
living
*NL*
together
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
why
are
you
still
vexed
and
grieved
?
''
The
old
man
's
eyes
beamed
*NL*
with
an
expression
of
gentle
affection
.
``
Yes
,
I
understand
,
''
said
*NL*
Valentine
;
``
it
is
because
you
love
me
.
''
The
old
man
assented
.
``
And
you
*NL*
are
afraid
I
shall
be
unhappy

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
not
like
M.
Franz

The
eyes
repeated
several
times
,
``
No

no

no

*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
are
vexed

engagement

''
said
Valentine
,
throwing
herself
on
her
knees
,
and
*NL*
putting
her
arm
round
her
grandfather
's
neck
,
``
I
am
vexed
,
too
,
for
I
do
*NL*
not
love
M.
Franz
d'Epinay
.
''
An
expression
of
intense
joy
illumined
the
*NL*
old
man
's
eyes
.
``
When
I
wished
to
retire
into
a
convent
,
you
remember
*NL*
how
angry
you
were
with
me
?
''
A
tear
trembled
in
the
eye
of
the
invalid
.
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
continued
Valentine
,
``
the
reason
of
my
proposing
it
was
that
*NL*
I
might
escape
this
hateful
marriage
,
which
drives
me
to
despair
.
''
*NL*
Noirtier
's
breathing
came
thick
and
short
.
``
Then
the
idea
of
this
*NL*
marriage
really
grieves
you
too
?
Ah
,
if
you
could
but
help
me
--
if
we
*NL*
could
both
together
defeat
their
plan
!
But
you
are
unable
to
oppose
*NL*
them
,
--
you
,
whose
mind
is
so
quick
,
and
whose
will
is
so
firm
are
*NL*
nevertheless
,
as
weak
and
unequal
to
the
contest
as
I
am
myself
.
Alas
,
*NL*
you
,
who
would
have
been
such
a
powerful
protector
to
me
in
the
days
*NL*
of
your
health
and
strength
,
can
now
only
sympathize
in
my
joys
and
*NL*
sorrows
,
without
being
able
to
take
any
active
part
in
them
.
However
,
*NL*
this
is
much
,
and
calls
for
gratitude
and
heaven
has
not
taken
away
all
*NL*
my
blessings
when
it
leaves
me
your
sympathy
and
kindness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
these
words
there
appeared
in
Noirtier
's
eye
an
expression
of
such
*NL*
deep
meaning
that
the
young
girl
thought
she
could
read
these
words
*NL*
there
:
``
You
are
mistaken
;
I
can
still
do
much
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
you
can
help
me
,
dear
grandpapa
?
''
said
Valentine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
Noirtier
raised
his
eyes
,
it
was
the
sign
agreed
on
between
him
*NL*
and
Valentine
when
he
wanted
anything
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
you
want
,
dear
grandpapa
?
''
said
Valentine
,
and
she
*NL*
endeavored
to
recall
to
mind
all
the
things
which
he
would
be
likely
to
*NL*
need
;
and
as
the
ideas
presented
themselves
to
her
mind
,
she
repeated
*NL*
them
aloud
,
then
,
--
finding
that
all
her
efforts
elicited
nothing
but
a
*NL*
constant
``
No
,
''
--
she
said
,
``
Come
,
since
this
plan
does
not
answer
,
I
*NL*
will
have
recourse
to
another
.
''
She
then
recited
all
the
letters
of
the
*NL*
alphabet
from
A
down
to
N
.
When
she
arrived
at
that
letter
the
paralytic
*NL*
made
her
understand
that
she
had
spoken
the
initial
letter
of
the
thing
*NL*
he
wanted
.
``
Ah
,
''
said
Valentine
,
``
the
thing
you
desire
begins
with
the
*NL*
letter
N
;
it
is
with
N
that
we
have
to
do
,
then
.
Well
,
let
me
see
,
what
*NL*
can
you
want
that
begins
with
N
?
Na
--
Ne
--
Ni
--
No
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
yes
,
''
said
the
old
man
's
eye
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
it
is
No
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
Valentine
fetched
a
dictionary
,
which
she
placed
on
a
desk
*NL*
before
Noirtier
;
she
opened
it
,
and
,
seeing
that
the
odd
man
's
eye
was
*NL*
thoroughly
fixed
on
its
pages
,
she
ran
her
finger
quickly
up
and
down
*NL*
the
columns
.
During
the
six
years
which
had
passed
since
Noirtier
first
*NL*
fell
into
this
sad
state
,
Valentine
's
powers
of
invention
had
been
too
*NL*
often
put
to
the
test
not
to
render
her
expert
in
devising
expedients
*NL*
for
gaining
a
knowledge
of
his
wishes
,
and
the
constant
practice
had
*NL*
so
perfected
her
in
the
art
that
she
guessed
the
old
man
's
meaning
as
*NL*
quickly
as
if
he
himself
had
been
able
to
seek
for
what
he
wanted
.
At
*NL*
the
word
``
Notary
,
''
Noirtier
made
a
sign
to
her
to
stop
.
``
Notary
,
''
said
*NL*
she
,
``
do
you
want
a
notary
,
dear
grandpapa
?
''
The
old
man
again
signified
*NL*
that
it
was
a
notary
he
desired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
would
wish
a
notary
to
be
sent
for
then
?
''
said
Valentine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
my
father
be
informed
of
your
wish
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
wish
the
notary
to
be
sent
for
immediately
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
they
shall
go
for
him
directly
,
dear
grandpapa
.
Is
that
all
you
*NL*
want
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
Valentine
rang
the
bell
,
and
ordered
the
servant
to
tell
Monsieur
*NL*
or
Madame
de
Villefort
that
they
were
requested
to
come
to
M.
Noirtier
's
*NL*
room
.
``
Are
you
satisfied
now
?
''
inquired
Valentine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sure
you
are
;
it
is
not
very
difficult
to
discover
that
,
''
--
and
the
*NL*
young
girl
smiled
on
her
grandfather
,
as
if
he
had
been
a
child
.
M.
de
*NL*
Villefort
entered
,
followed
by
Barrois
.
``
What
do
you
want
me
for
,
sir
?
''
*NL*
demanded
he
of
the
paralytic
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
,
''
said
Valentine
,
``
my
grandfather
wishes
for
a
notary
.
''
At
this
*NL*
strange
and
unexpected
demand
M.
de
Villefort
and
his
father
exchanged
*NL*
looks
.
``
Yes
,
''
motioned
the
latter
,
with
a
firmness
which
seemed
to
*NL*
declare
that
with
the
help
of
Valentine
and
his
old
servant
,
who
*NL*
both
knew
what
his
wishes
were
,
he
was
quite
prepared
to
maintain
the
*NL*
contest
.
``
Do
you
wish
for
a
notary
?
''
asked
Villefort
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
to
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Noirtier
made
no
answer
.
``
What
do
you
want
with
a
notary
?
''
again
*NL*
repeated
Villefort
.
The
invalid
's
eye
remained
fixed
,
by
which
*NL*
expression
he
intended
to
intimate
that
his
resolution
was
unalterable
.
*NL*
``
Is
it
to
do
us
some
ill
turn
?
Do
you
think
it
is
worth
while
?
''
said
*NL*
Villefort
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Still
,
''
said
Barrois
,
with
the
freedom
and
fidelity
of
an
old
servant
,
*NL*
``
if
M.
Noirtier
asks
for
a
notary
,
I
suppose
he
really
wishes
for
*NL*
a
notary
;
therefore
I
shall
go
at
once
and
fetch
one
.
''
Barrois
*NL*
acknowledged
no
master
but
Noirtier
,
and
never
allowed
his
desires
in
*NL*
any
way
to
be
contradicted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
do
want
a
notary
,
''
motioned
the
old
man
,
shutting
his
eyes
with
*NL*
a
look
of
defiance
,
which
seemed
to
say
,
``
and
I
should
like
to
see
the
*NL*
person
who
dares
to
refuse
my
request
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
shall
have
a
notary
,
as
you
absolutely
wish
for
one
,
sir
,
''
said
*NL*
Villefort
;
``
but
I
shall
explain
to
him
your
state
of
health
,
and
make
*NL*
excuses
for
you
,
for
the
scene
can
not
fail
of
being
a
most
ridiculous
*NL*
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
mind
that
,
''
said
Barrois
;
``
I
shall
go
and
fetch
a
notary
,
*NL*
nevertheless
,
''
--
and
the
old
servant
departed
triumphantly
on
his
*NL*
mission
.

Chapter
59
.
The
Will
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
Barrois
had
left
the
room
,
Noirtier
looked
at
Valentine
with
*NL*
a
malicious
expression
that
said
many
things
.
The
young
girl
perfectly
*NL*
understood
the
look
,
and
so
did
Villefort
,
for
his
countenance
became
*NL*
clouded
,
and
he
knitted
his
eyebrows
angrily
.
He
took
a
seat
,
and
*NL*
quietly
awaited
the
arrival
of
the
notary
.
Noirtier
saw
him
seat
himself
*NL*
with
an
appearance
of
perfect
indifference
,
at
the
same
time
giving
a
*NL*
side
look
at
Valentine
,
which
made
her
understand
that
she
also
was
to
*NL*
remain
in
the
room
.
Three-quarters
of
an
hour
after
,
Barrois
returned
,
*NL*
bringing
the
notary
with
him
.
``
Sir
,
''
said
Villefort
,
after
the
first
*NL*
salutations
were
over
,
``
you
were
sent
for
by
M.
Noirtier
,
whom
you
see
*NL*
here
.
All
his
limbs
have
become
completely
paralysed
,
he
has
lost
his
*NL*
voice
also
,
and
we
ourselves
find
much
trouble
in
endeavoring
to
catch
*NL*
some
fragments
of
his
meaning
.
''
Noirtier
cast
an
appealing
look
on
*NL*
Valentine
,
which
look
was
at
once
so
earnest
and
imperative
,
that
*NL*
she
answered
immediately
.
``
Sir
,
''
said
she
,
``
I
perfectly
understand
my
*NL*
grandfather
's
meaning
at
all
times
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
quite
true
,
''
said
Barrois
;
``
and
that
is
what
I
told
the
*NL*
gentleman
as
we
walked
along
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Permit
me
,
''
said
the
notary
,
turning
first
to
Villefort
and
then
to
*NL*
Valentine
--
``
permit
me
to
state
that
the
case
in
question
is
just
one
*NL*
of
those
in
which
a
public
officer
like
myself
can
not
proceed
to
act
*NL*
without
thereby
incurring
a
dangerous
responsibility
.
The
first
*NL*
thing
necessary
to
render
an
act
valid
is
,
that
the
notary
should
be
*NL*
thoroughly
convinced
that
he
has
faithfully
interpreted
the
will
and
*NL*
wishes
of
the
person
dictating
the
act
.
Now
I
can
not
be
sure
of
the
*NL*
approbation
or
disapprobation
of
a
client
who
can
not
speak
,
and
as
the
*NL*
object
of
his
desire
or
his
repugnance
can
not
be
clearly
proved
to
*NL*
me
,
on
account
of
his
want
of
speech
,
my
services
here
would
be
quite
*NL*
useless
,
and
can
not
be
legally
exercised
.
''
The
notary
then
prepared
to
*NL*
retire
.
An
imperceptible
smile
of
triumph
was
expressed
on
the
lips
of
*NL*
the
procureur
.
Noirtier
looked
at
Valentine
with
an
expression
so
full
*NL*
of
grief
,
that
she
arrested
the
departure
of
the
notary
.
``
Sir
,
''
said
*NL*
she
,
``
the
language
which
I
speak
with
my
grandfather
may
be
easily
*NL*
learnt
,
and
I
can
teach
you
in
a
few
minutes
,
to
understand
it
almost
as
*NL*
well
as
I
can
myself
.
Will
you
tell
me
what
you
require
,
in
order
to
set
*NL*
your
conscience
quite
at
ease
on
the
subject
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
order
to
render
an
act
valid
,
I
must
be
certain
of
the
approbation
*NL*
or
disapprobation
of
my
client
.
Illness
of
body
would
not
affect
the
*NL*
validity
of
the
deed
,
but
sanity
of
mind
is
absolutely
requisite
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
sir
,
by
the
help
of
two
signs
,
with
which
I
will
acquaint
you
*NL*
presently
,
you
may
ascertain
with
perfect
certainty
that
my
grandfather
*NL*
is
still
in
the
full
possession
of
all
his
mental
faculties
.
M.
*NL*
Noirtier
,
being
deprived
of
voice
and
motion
,
is
accustomed
to
convey
*NL*
his
meaning
by
closing
his
eyes
when
he
wishes
to
signify
`
yes
,
'
and
*NL*
to
wink
when
he
means
`
no
.
'
You
now
know
quite
enough
to
enable
you
to
*NL*
converse
with
M.
Noirtier
;
--
try
.
''
Noirtier
gave
Valentine
such
a
look
*NL*
of
tenderness
and
gratitude
that
it
was
comprehended
even
by
the
notary
*NL*
himself
.
``
You
have
heard
and
understood
what
your
granddaughter
has
been
*NL*
saying
,
sir
,
have
you
?
''
asked
the
notary
.
Noirtier
closed
his
eyes
.
``
And
*NL*
you
approve
of
what
she
said
--
that
is
to
say
,
you
declare
that
the
*NL*
signs
which
she
mentioned
are
really
those
by
means
of
which
you
are
*NL*
accustomed
to
convey
your
thoughts

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
you
who
sent

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

*NL*
*NL*
``
To

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
do
not
wish
me
to
go
away
without
fulfilling
your
original

''
The
old
man
winked
violently
.
``
Well
,
sir
,
''
said
the
young
*NL*
girl
,
``
do
you
understand
now
,
and
is
your
conscience
perfectly
at
rest
*NL*
on
the
subject
?
''
But
before
the
notary
could
answer
,
Villefort
had
drawn
*NL*
him
aside
.
``
Sir
,
''
said
he
,
``
do
you
suppose
for
a
moment
that
a
man
can
*NL*
sustain
a
physical
shock

such
as
M.

has
received
,
without
any
*NL*
detriment
to
his
mental
faculties

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
not
exactly
that
,
sir
,
''
said
the
notary
,
``
which
makes
me
uneasy
,
*NL*
but
the
difficulty
will
be
in
wording
his
thoughts
and
intentions
,
so
as
*NL*
to
be
able
to
get
his
answers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
see
that
to
be
an
utter
impossibility
,
''
said
Villefort
.
*NL*
Valentine
and
the
old
man
heard
this
conversation
,
and
Noirtier
fixed
*NL*
his
eye
so
earnestly
on
Valentine
that
she
felt
bound
to
answer
to
the
*NL*
look
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
,
''
said
she
,
``
that
need
not
make
you
uneasy

difficult
it

discover

thoughts

so
as
to
put
an
end
to
all
your
doubts

fears
*NL*
on

subject

I
have
now
been
six
years
with
M.
Noirtier
,

let
him
*NL*
tell
you
if
ever
once

during
that
time

he
has
entertained
a

he
was
unable

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

signed
the
old
man

*NL*
*NL*
``
Let

try
what

*NL*
``
Well
,
sir
,
what
do
you
require
of
me
,
and
what
document
is
it
that
you
*NL*
wish
to
be
drawn
up
?
''
Valentine
named
all
the
letters
of
the
alphabet
*NL*
until
she
came
to
W
.
At
this
letter
the
eloquent
eye
of
Noirtier
gave
*NL*
her
notice
that
she
was
to
stop
.
``
It
is
very
evident
that
it
is
the
*NL*
letter
W
which
M.
Noirtier
wants
,
''
said
the
notary
.
``
Wait
,
''
*NL*
said
Valentine
;
and
,
turning
to
her
grandfather
,
she
repeated
,
*NL*
``
Wa
--
We
--
Wi
''
--
The
old
man
stopped
her
at
the
last
syllable
.
Valentine
*NL*
then
took
the
dictionary
,
and
the
notary
watched
her
while
she
turned
*NL*
over
the
pages
.
She
passed
her
finger
slowly
down
the
columns
,
and
when
*NL*
she
came
to
the
word
``
Will
,
''
M.
Noirtier
's
eye
bade
her
stop
.
``
Will
,
''
*NL*
said
the
notary
;
``
it
is
very
evident
that
M.
Noirtier
is
desirous
of
*NL*
making
his
will
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
yes
,
''
motioned
the
invalid
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
,
sir
,
you
must
allow
that
this
is
most
extraordinary
,
''
said
*NL*
the
astonished
notary
,
turning
to
M.
de
Villefort
.
``
Yes
,
''
said
the
*NL*
procureur
,
``
and
I
think
the
will
promises
to
be
yet
more
extraordinary
,
*NL*
for
I
can
not
see
how
it
is
to
be
drawn
up
without
the
intervention
of
*NL*
Valentine
,
and
she
may
,
perhaps
,
be
considered
as
too
much
interested
in
*NL*
its
contents
to
allow
of
her
being
a
suitable
interpreter
of
the
obscure
*NL*
and
ill-defined
wishes
of
her
grandfather
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
no
,
''
replied
the
eye
of
the
paralytic
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
said
Villefort
,
``
do
you
mean
to
say
that
Valentine
is
not
*NL*
interested
in
your
will
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
,
''
said
the
notary
,
whose
interest
had
been
greatly
excited
,
and
*NL*
who
had
resolved
on
publishing
far
and
wide
the
account
of
this
*NL*
extraordinary
and
picturesque
scene
,
``
what
appeared
so
impossible
to
me
*NL*
an
hour
ago
,
has
now
become
quite
easy
and
practicable
,
and
this
may
*NL*
be
a
perfectly
valid
will
,
provided
it
be
read
in
the
presence
of
seven
*NL*
witnesses
,
approved
by
the
testator
,
and
sealed
by
the
notary
in
the
*NL*
presence
of
the
witnesses
.
As
to
the
time
,
it
will
not
require
very
much
*NL*
more
than
the
generality
of
wills
.
There
are
certain
forms
necessary
to
*NL*
be
gone
through
,
and
which
are
always
the
same
.
As
to
the
details
,
the
*NL*
greater
part
will
be
furnished
afterwards
by
the
state
in
which
we
*NL*
find
the
affairs
of
the
testator
,
and
by
yourself
,
who
,
having
had
the
*NL*
management
of
them
,
can
doubtless
give
full
information
on
the
subject
.
*NL*
But
besides
all
this
,
in
order
that
the
instrument
may
not
be
contested
,
*NL*
I
am
anxious
to
give
it
the
greatest
possible
authenticity
,
therefore
,
*NL*
one
of
my
colleagues
will
help
me
,
and
,
contrary
to
custom
,
will
assist
*NL*
in
the
dictation
of
the
testament
.
Are
you
satisfied
,
sir
?
''
continued
*NL*
the
notary
,
addressing
the
old
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
looked
the
invalid
,
his
eye
beaming
with
delight
at
the
ready
*NL*
interpretation
of
his
meaning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
he
going
to
do
?
''
thought
Villefort
,
whose
position
demanded
*NL*
much
reserve
,
but
who
was
longing
to
know
what
his
father
's
intentions
*NL*
were
.
He
left
the
room
to
give
orders
for
another
notary
to
be
sent
,
but
*NL*
Barrois
,
who
had
heard
all
that
passed
,
had
guessed
his
master
's
wishes
,
*NL*
and
had
already
gone
to
fetch
one
.
The
procureur
then
told
his
wife
to
*NL*
come
up
.
In
the
course
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
every
one
had
assembled
*NL*
in
the
chamber
of
the
paralytic
;
the
second
notary
had
also
arrived
.
A
*NL*
few
words
sufficed
for
a
mutual
understanding
between
the
two
officers
*NL*
of
the
law
.
They
read
to
Noirtier
the
formal
copy
of
a
will
,
in
order
*NL*
to
give
him
an
idea
of
the
terms
in
which
such
documents
are
generally
*NL*
couched
;
then
,
in
order
to
test
the
capacity
of
the
testator
,
the
first
*NL*
notary
said
,
turning
towards
him
,
--
``
When
an
individual
makes
his
will
,
*NL*
it
is
generally
in
favor
or
in
prejudice
of
some
person
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
an
exact
idea
of
the
amount
of
your
fortune
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
name
to
you
several
sums
which
will
increase
by
gradation
;
you
*NL*
will
stop
me
when
I
reach
the
one
representing
the
amount
of
your
own
*NL*
possessions
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
There
was
a
kind
of
solemnity
in
this
interrogation
.
Never
had
*NL*
the
struggle
between
mind
and
matter
been
more
apparent
than
now
,
and
*NL*
if
it
was
not
a
sublime
,
it
was
,
at
least
,
a
curious
spectacle
.
They
had
*NL*
formed
a
circle
round
the
invalid
;
the
second
notary
was
sitting
at
a
*NL*
table
,
prepared
for
writing
,
and
his
colleague
was
standing
before
the
*NL*
testator
in
the
act
of
interrogating
him
on
the
subject
to
which
we
have
*NL*
alluded
.
``
Your
fortune
exceeds
300,000
.
francs
,
does
it
not
?
''
asked
*NL*
he
.
Noirtier
made
a
sign
that
it
did
.
``
Do
you
possess
400,000
francs
?
''
*NL*
inquired
the
notary
.
Noirtier
's
eye
remained
immovable
.
``
Five
*NL*
hundred
thousand
?
''
The
same
expression
continued
.
``
Six
hundred
*NL*
thousand
--
700,000
--
800,000
--
900,000
?
''
Noirtier
stopped
him
at
the
*NL*
last-named
sum
.
``
You
are
then
in
possession
of
900,000
.
francs
?
''
asked
*NL*
the
notary
.
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
landed
property
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
stock
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
stock
is
in
your
own
hands
?
''
The
look
which
M.
Noirtier
cast
on
*NL*
Barrois
showed
that
there
was
something
wanting
which
he
knew
where
to
*NL*
find
.
The
old
servant
left
the
room
,
and
presently
returned
,
bringing
*NL*
with
him
a
small
casket
.
``
Do
you
permit
us
to
open
this
casket
?
''
asked
*NL*
the
notary
.
Noirtier
gave
his
assent
.
They
opened
it
,
and
found
900,000
.
*NL*
francs
in
bank
scrip
.
The
first
notary
handed
over
each
note
,
as
he
*NL*
examined
it
,
to
his
colleague
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
total
amount
was
found
to
be
as
M.
Noirtier
had
stated
.
``
It
is
all
*NL*
as
he
has
said
;
it
is
very
evident
that
the
mind
still
retains
its
full
*NL*
force
and
vigor
.
''
Then
,
turning
towards
the
paralytic
,
he
said
,
``
You
*NL*
possess
,
then
,
900,000
.
francs
of
capital
,
which
,
according
to
the
*NL*
manner
in
which
you
have
invested
it
,
ought
to
bring
in
an
income
of
*NL*
about
40,000
livres
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
whom
do
you
desire
to
leave
this
fortune
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
said
Madame
de
Villefort
,
``
there
is
not
much
doubt
on
that
*NL*
subject
.
M.
Noirtier
tenderly
loves
his
granddaughter
,
Mademoiselle
de
*NL*
Villefort
;
it
is
she
who
has
nursed
and
tended
him
for
six
years
,
and
*NL*
has
,
by
her
devoted
attention
,
fully
secured
the
affection
,
I
had
almost
*NL*
said
the
gratitude
,
of
her
grandfather
,
and
it
is
but
just
that
she
*NL*
should
reap
the
fruit
of
her
devotion
.
''
The
eye
of
Noirtier
clearly
*NL*
showed
by
its
expression
that
he
was
not
deceived
by
the
false
assent
*NL*
given
by
Madame
de
Villefort
's
words
and
manner
to
the
motives
which
she
*NL*
supposed
him
to
entertain
.
``
Is
it
,
then
,
to
Mademoiselle
Valentine
de
*NL*
Villefort
that
you
leave
these
900,000
francs
?
''
demanded
the
notary
,
*NL*
thinking
he
had
only
to
insert
this
clause
,
but
waiting
first
for
the
*NL*
assent
of
Noirtier
,
which
it
was
necessary
should
be
given
before
all
*NL*
the
witnesses
of
this
singular
scene
.
Valentine
,
when
her
name
was
*NL*
made
the
subject
of
discussion
,
had
stepped
back
,
to
escape
unpleasant
*NL*
observation
;
her
eyes
were
cast
down
,
and
she
was
crying
.
The
old
*NL*
man
looked
at
her
for
an
instant
with
an
expression
of
the
deepest
*NL*
tenderness
,
then
,
turning
towards
the
notary
,
he
significantly
winked
*NL*
his
eye
in
token
of
dissent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
''
said
the
notary
,
``
do
you
not
intend
making
Mademoiselle
*NL*
Valentine
de
Villefort
your
residuary
legatee
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
not
making
any
mistake
,
are
you
?
''
said
the
notary
;
``
you
really
*NL*
mean
to
declare
that
such
is
not
your
intention
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
repeated
Noirtier
;
``
No
.
''
Valentine
raised
her
head
,
struck
dumb
*NL*
with
astonishment
.
It
was
not
so
much
the
conviction
that
she
was
*NL*
disinherited
that
caused
her
grief
,
but
her
total
inability
to
account
*NL*
for
the
feelings
which
had
provoked
her
grandfather
to
such
an
act
.
But
*NL*
Noirtier
looked
at
her
with
so
much
affectionate
tenderness
that
she
*NL*
exclaimed
,
``
Oh
,
grandpapa
,
I
see
now
that
it
is
only
your
fortune
of
*NL*
which
you
deprive
me
;
you
still
leave
me
the
love
which
I
have
always
*NL*
enjoyed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
yes
,
most
assuredly
,
''
said
the
eyes
of
the
paralytic
,
for
he
closed
*NL*
them
with
an
expression
which
Valentine
could
not
mistake
.
``
Thank
you
,
*NL*
thank
you
,
''
murmured
she
.
The
old
man
's
declaration
that
Valentine
*NL*
was
not
the
destined
inheritor
of
his
fortune
had
excited
the
hopes
of
*NL*
Madame
de
Villefort
;
she
gradually
approached
the
invalid
,
and
said
:
*NL*
``
Then
,
doubtless
,
dear
M.
Noirtier
,
you
intend
leaving
your
fortune
*NL*
to
your
grandson
,
Edward
de
Villefort
?
''
The
winking
of
the
eyes
which
*NL*
answered
this
speech
was
most
decided
and
terrible
,
and
expressed
a
*NL*
feeling
almost
amounting
to
hatred
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
?
''
said
the
notary
;
``
then
,
perhaps
,
it
is
to
your
son
,
M.
de
*NL*
Villefort
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
The
two
notaries
looked
at
each
other
in
mute
astonishment
and
*NL*
inquiry
as
to
what
were
the
real
intentions
of
the
testator
.
Villefort
*NL*
and
his
wife
both
grew
red
,
one
from
shame
,
the
other
from
anger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
have
we
all
done
,
then
,
dear
grandpapa
?
''
said
Valentine
;
``
you
no
*NL*
longer
seem
to
love
any
of
us
?
''
The
old
man
's
eyes
passed
rapidly
*NL*
from
Villefort
and
his
wife
,
and
rested
on
Valentine
with
a
look
of
*NL*
unutterable
fondness
.
``
Well
,
''
said
she
;
``
if
you
love
me
,
grandpapa
,
try
*NL*
and
bring
that
love
to
bear
upon
your
actions
at
this
present
moment
.
*NL*
You
know
me
well
enough
to
be
quite
sure
that
I
have
never
thought
*NL*
of
your
fortune
;
besides
,
they
say
I
am
already
rich
in
right
of
my
*NL*
mother
--
too
rich
,
even
.
Explain
yourself
,
then
.
''
Noirtier
fixed
his
*NL*
intelligent
eyes
on
Valentine
's
hand
.
``
My
hand
?
''
said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Her
hand
!
''
exclaimed
every
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
gentlemen
,
you
see
it
is
all
useless
,
and
that
my
father
's
mind
is
*NL*
really
impaired
,
''
said
Villefort
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
cried
Valentine
suddenly
,
``
I
understand
.
It
is
my
marriage
you
*NL*
mean
,
is
it
not
,
dear
grandpapa
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
yes
,
''
signed
the
paralytic
,
casting
on
Valentine
a
look
of
*NL*
joyful
gratitude
for
having
guessed
his
meaning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
angry
with
us
all
on
account
of
this
marriage
,
are
you
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
,
this
is
too
absurd
,
''
said
Villefort
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excuse
me
,
sir
,
''
replied
the
notary
;
``
on
the
contrary
,
the
meaning
of
*NL*
M.
Noirtier
is
quite
evident
to
me
,
and
I
can
quite
easily
connect
the
*NL*
train
of
ideas
passing
in
his
mind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
not
wish
me
to
marry
M.
Franz
d'Epinay
?
''
observed
Valentine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
wish
it
,
''
said
the
eye
of
her
grandfather
.
``
And
you
disinherit
*NL*
your
granddaughter
,
''
continued
the
notary
,
``
because
she
has
contracted
*NL*
an
engagement
contrary
to
your
wishes
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
that
,
but
for
this
marriage
,
she
would
have
been
your
heir
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
There
was
a
profound
silence
.
The
two
notaries
were
holding
*NL*
a
consultation
as
to
the
best
means
of
proceeding
with
the
affair
.
*NL*
Valentine
was
looking
at
her
grandfather
with
a
smile
of
intense
*NL*
gratitude
,
and
Villefort
was
biting
his
lips
with
vexation
,
while
Madame
*NL*
de
Villefort
could
not
succeed
in
repressing
an
inward
feeling
of
joy
,
*NL*
which
,
in
spite
of
herself
,
appeared
in
her
whole
countenance
.
``
But

to
break

silence

The

gave
no

You

I
am
quite
resigned

These
900,000

will
go
out
of

enrich
some
hospital

it

ridiculous

quitted

*NL*
M.

Madame

found
on
their
return
that
the
Count
of
Monte
*NL*
Cristo
,
who
had
come
to
visit
them
in
their
absence

had
been
ushered
*NL*
into
the
drawing-room
,

was
still
awaiting
them
there
.
Madame

Villefort
,
who
had
not
yet
sufficiently
recovered
from
her
late
emotion
*NL*
to
allow
of
her
entertaining
visitors
so
immediately
,
retired
to
her
*NL*
bedroom
,
while
the
procureur
,
who
could
better
depend
upon
himself
,
*NL*
proceeded
at
once
to
the
salon

Although
M.
de
Villefort
flattered
*NL*
himself
that
,
to
all
outward
view
,
he
had
completely
masked
the
feelings

were
passing
in

he
did
not
know
that
the
cloud
was
*NL*
still
lowering
on
his
brow
,
so
much
so
that
the
count
,
whose
smile
was
*NL*
radiant
,
immediately
noticed
his
sombre
and
thoughtful
air
.
``
Ma

*NL*

Monte

after
the
first
compliments
were
over

Villefort
tried
to

smile

No

The

perceived

beginning
to
speak

appeared
to
pay
no

feigned

busily
engaged

watching

pouring

Villefort

in

you
know

I
have
never
been
accustomed

I
ever
considered
that
the
fate

it

necessary

that
the
folly

should
not
be
allowed
to
overturn
a
project
which
I
have

entertained
for
so
many
years

The
Baron

was
my
friend

an
alliance

pretended

heard

every

word

Madame

replied
Villefort
``
I
can
truly
say
that
*NL*
I
have
always
entertained
a
high
respect

my
father
,
because
,
to
the
*NL*
natural
feeling
of
relationship
was
added
the
consciousness
of
his
moral
*NL*
superiority
.
The
name
of
father
is
sacred
in
two
senses
;
he
should
be
*NL*
reverenced
as
the
author
of
our
being
and
as
a
master
whom
we
ought
to
*NL*
obey
.
But
,
under
the
present
circumstances

I
am
justified

doubting

the
wisdom
of
an
old
man
who
,
because
he
hated
the
father
,
vents
his
*NL*
anger
on
the
son

It
would
be
ridiculous
in
me
to
regulate
my
conduct
*NL*
by
such
caprices

I
shall
still
continue

preserve

respect

I
will
suffer

without
complaint

the
pecuniary

deprivation

I
shall
remain
firm
in

my
determination

the
world
shall
see
which
party
has
reason
on

his
side

Consequently
I
shall
marry
my
daughter
to
the
Baron
Franz

d'Epinay

I
consider
it
would
be
a
proper

eligible
match
*NL*

to
make

in

I
choose

bestow
my

I

brought
Noirtier
and
M.
d'Epinay
into
personal
contact
.
Although
*NL*
General
d'Epinay
served
under
Napoleon
,
did
he
not
still
retain
royalist
*NL*
sentiments
?
And
was
he
not
the
person
who
was
assassinated
one
evening
*NL*
on
leaving
a
Bonapartist
meeting
to
which
he
had
been
invited
on
the
*NL*
supposition
that
he
favored
the
cause
of
the
emperor
?
''
Villefort
looked
*NL*
at
the
count
almost
with
terror
.
``
Am
I
mistaken
,
then
?
''
said
Monte
*NL*
Cristo
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
,
the
facts
were
precisely
what
you
have
stated
,
''
said
Madame
*NL*
de
Villefort
;
``
and
it
was
to
prevent
the
renewal
of
old
feuds
that
M.
de
*NL*
Villefort
formed
the
idea
of
uniting
in
the
bonds
of
affection
the
two
*NL*
children
of
these
inveterate
enemies
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
a
sublime
and
charitable
thought
,
''
said
Monte
Cristo
,
``
and
the
*NL*
whole
world
should
applaud
it
.
It
would
be
noble
to
see
Mademoiselle
*NL*
Noirtier
de
Villefort
assuming
the
title
of
Madame
Franz
d'Epinay
.
''
*NL*
Villefort
shuddered
and
looked
at
Monte
Cristo
as
if
he
wished
to
read
*NL*
in
his
countenance
the
real
feelings
which
had
dictated
the
words
he
*NL*
had
just
uttered
.
But
the
count
completely
baffled
the
procureur
,
and
*NL*
prevented
him
from
discovering
anything
beneath
the
never-varying
*NL*
smile
he
was
so
constantly
in
the
habit
of
assuming
.
``
Although
,
''
*NL*
said
Villefort
,
``
it
will
be
a
serious
thing
for
Valentine
to
lose
*NL*
her
grandfather
's
fortune
,
I
do
not
think
that
M.
d'Epinay
will
be
*NL*
frightened
at
this
pecuniary
loss
.
He
will
,
perhaps
,
hold
me
in
greater
*NL*
esteem
than
the
money
itself
,
seeing
that
I
sacrifice
everything
in
*NL*
order
to
keep
my
word
with
him
.
Besides
,
he
knows
that
Valentine
is
rich
*NL*
in
right
of
her
mother
,
and
that
she
will
,
in
all
probability
,
inherit
*NL*
the
fortune
of
M.
and
Madame
de
Saint-Meran
,
her
mother
's
parents
,
who
*NL*
both
love
her
tenderly

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
who
are
fully
as
well
worth
loving

tending

M.

*NL*
said
Madame
de
Villefort
;
``
besides
,
they
are
to
come
to
Paris
in
about
*NL*
a
month

Valentine
,
after
the
affront

has
received
,
need
not
*NL*
consider
it
necessary
to
continue
to
bury
herself
alive
by
being
shut
up
*NL*
with
M.
Noirtier

''
The
count
listened
with
satisfaction
to
this
tale
*NL*
of
wounded
self-love
and
defeated
ambition
.
``
But
it
seems
to
me
,
''
said
*NL*
Monte
Cristo
,
``
and
I
must
begin
by
asking
your
pardon

what
I

*NL*
about
to
say
,
that
if

Noirtier
disinherits
Mademoiselle
de
Villefort
*NL*
because
she
is
going
to
marry
a
man
whose
father
he
detested
,
he
can
not
*NL*
have
the
same
cause
of
complaint
against
this
dear
Edward

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
True

''
said
Madame

,
with
an
intonation
of
voice
which
it
*NL*
is
impossible
to
describe
;
``
is
it
not
unjust

shamefully
unjust
?
Poor
*NL*
Edward
is
as
much
M.

Valentine
,
and
yet
,
if
she
*NL*
had
not
been
going
to
marry
M.
Franz
,
M.
Noirtier
would
have
left
*NL*
her
all
his

supposing

to
be
disinherited
by

she
will
still
be
three
times
richer
than
he

The
count
*NL*
listened
and
said
no
more
.
``
Count

''
said
Villefort
,
``
we
will
not
*NL*
entertain
you

true
that

will
go
to
endow
charitable

my

will

have
deprived

*NL*
``

said
Madame

,
returning
to
the
one
idea
which
*NL*
incessantly
occupied
her
mind
,
``
perhaps
it
would
be
better
to
explain

this

give
him
the
opportunity

himself
renouncing

Monte

*NL*
``
Undoubtedly

Villefort
,
moderating
the
tones
of
his
voice
,
``
a
*NL*
marriage
once
concerted
and
then
broken
off

throws
a
sort
of
discredit

;
then
again
,
the
old
reports

which
I
was
so
anxious
to
*NL*

an

instantly
gain
ground

No

all
go
well

M.

if
he
is
an
honorable
man
,
will
consider
himself
more
than

ever
pledged
to
Mademoiselle

he
were
actuated
by
a
*NL*
decided
feeling

that
is
impossible

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
agree
with
M.

said
Monte

,
fixing
his
eyes
on

Madame

;
``

The

arose

delighted
with
the
proposition
,

his

slightly
changed
*NL*
color
.

all

said
he
,
extending
his
hand
to
Monte

Therefore

here
look
upon
what

passed
to-day

it

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A

So
now
I
have

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
telegraph
?
''
repeated
Madame
de
Villefort
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
a
telegraph
.
I
had
often
seen
one
placed
at
the
end
of
a
road
on
*NL*
a
hillock
,
and
in
the
light
of
the
sun
its
black
arms
,
bending
in
every
*NL*
direction
,
always
reminded
me
of
the
claws
of
an
immense
beetle
,
and
I
*NL*
assure
you
it
was
never
without
emotion
that
I
gazed
on
it
,
for
I
could
*NL*
not
help
thinking
how
wonderful
it
was
that
these
various
signs
should
*NL*
be
made
to
cleave
the
air
with
such
precision
as
to
convey
to
the
*NL*
distance
of
three
hundred
leagues
the
ideas
and
wishes
of
a
man
sitting
*NL*
at
a
table
at
one
end
of
the
line
to
another
man
similarly
placed
at
the
*NL*
opposite
extremity
,
and
all
this
effected
by
a
simple
act
of
volition
*NL*
on
the
part
of
the
sender
of
the
message
.
I
began
to
think
of
genii
,
*NL*
sylphs
,
gnomes
,
in
short
,
of
all
the
ministers
of
the
occult
sciences
,
*NL*
until
I
laughed
aloud
at
the
freaks
of
my
own
imagination
.
Now
,
it
never
*NL*
occurred
to
me
to
wish
for
a
nearer
inspection
of
these
large
insects
,
*NL*
with
their
long
black
claws
,
for
I
always
feared
to
find
under
their
*NL*
stone
wings
some
little
human
genius
fagged
to
death
with
cabals
,
*NL*
factions
,
and
government
intrigues
.
But
one
fine
day
I
learned
that
the
*NL*
mover
of
this
telegraph
was
only
a
poor
wretch
,
hired
for
twelve
hundred
*NL*
francs
a
year
,
and
employed
all
day
,
not
in
studying
the
heavens
like
*NL*
an
astronomer
,
or
in
gazing
on
the
water
like
an
angler
,
or
even
in
*NL*
enjoying
the
privilege
of
observing
the
country
around
him
,
but
all
his
*NL*
monotonous
life
was
passed
in
watching
his
white-bellied
,
black-clawed
*NL*
fellow
insect
,
four
or
five
leagues
distant
from
him
.
At
length
I
felt
*NL*
a
desire
to
study
this
living
chrysalis
more
closely
,
and
to
endeavor
*NL*
to
understand
the
secret
part
played
by
these
insect-actors
when
they
*NL*
occupy
themselves
simply
with
pulling
different
pieces
of
string
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
are
you
going
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am

''
*NL*

``
What
telegraph
do
you
intend
visiting

department
,

*NL*
of
the
observatory
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no

I
should
find
there
people
who
would
force
me
to
understand
*NL*
things
of
which
I
would
prefer
to
remain
ignorant
,
and
who
would
try
*NL*
to
explain
to
me
,
in

I
should

keep
my

unimpaired

it

quite
enough
to
have
those
dissipated
which

formed

fellow-creatures

I
shall
,
therefore

not
visit
either

of

telegraphs

one
in
the
open
country
where
I
shall
find

At
the
door
the
count
was
met
by
the
two
*NL*
notaries
,
who
had
just
completed
the
act
which
was
to
disinherit
*NL*
Valentine
,
and
who
were
leaving
under
the
conviction
of
having
done
a
*NL*
thing
which
could
not
fail
of
redounding
considerably
to
their
credit

How
a
Gardener
May
Get
Rid
of
the
Dormice
that
Eat
His
Peaches
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
on
the
same
night
,
as
he
had
intended
,
but
the
next
morning
,
the
*NL*
Count
of
Monte
Cristo
went
out
by
the
Barrier
d'Enfer
,
taking
the
*NL*
road
to
Orleans
.
Leaving
the
village
of
Linas
,
without
stopping
at
the
*NL*
telegraph
,
which
flourished
its
great
bony
arms
as
he
passed
,
the
count
*NL*
reached
the
tower
of
Montlhery
,
situated
,
as
every
one
knows
,
upon
the
*NL*
highest
point
of
the
plain
of
that
name
.
At
the
foot
of
the
hill
the
*NL*
count
dismounted
and
began
to
ascend
by
a
little
winding
path
,
about
*NL*
eighteen
inches
wide
;
when
he
reached
the
summit
he
found
himself
*NL*
stopped
by
a
hedge
,
upon
which
green
fruit
had
succeeded
to
red
and
*NL*
white
flowers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Monte
Cristo
looked
for
the
entrance
to
the
enclosure
,
and
was
not
long
*NL*
in
finding
a
little
wooden
gate
,
working
on
willow
hinges
,
and
fastened
*NL*
with
a
nail
and
string
.
The
count
soon
mastered
the
mechanism
,
the
gate
*NL*
opened
,
and
he
then
found
himself
in
a
little
garden
,
about
twenty
feet
*NL*
long
by
twelve
wide
,
bounded
on
one
side
by
part
of
the
hedge
,
which
*NL*
contained
the
ingenious
contrivance
we
have
called
a
gate
,
and
on
the
*NL*
other
by
the
old
tower
,
covered
with
ivy
and
studded
with
wall-flowers
.
*NL*
No
one
would
have
thought
in
looking
at
this
old
,
weather-beaten
,
*NL*
floral-decked
tower
-LRB-
which
might
be
likened
to
an
elderly
dame
dressed
*NL*
up
to
receive
her
grandchildren
at
a
birthday
feast
-RRB-
that
it
would
have
*NL*
been
capable
of
telling
strange
things
,
if
,
--
in
addition
to
the
menacing
*NL*
ears
which
the
proverb
says
all
walls
are
provided
with
,
--
it
had
also
a
*NL*
voice
.
The
garden
was
crossed
by
a
path
of
red
gravel
,
edged
by
a
border
*NL*
of
thick
box
,
of
many
years
'
growth
,
and
of
a
tone
and
color
that
would
*NL*
have
delighted
the
heart
of
Delacroix
,
our
modern
Rubens
.
This
path
was
*NL*
formed
in
the
shape
of
the
figure
of
8
,
thus
,
in
its
windings
,
making
a
*NL*
walk
of
sixty
feet
in
a
garden
of
only
twenty
.
*NL*
*NL*
Never
had
Flora
,
the
fresh
and
smiling
goddess
of
gardeners
,
been
*NL*
honored
with
a
purer
or
more
scrupulous
worship
than
that
which
was
paid
*NL*
to
her
in
this
little
enclosure
.
In
fact
,
of
the
twenty
rose-trees
which
*NL*
formed
the
parterre
,
not
one
bore
the
mark
of
the
slug
,
nor
were
there
*NL*
evidences
anywhere
of
the
clustering
aphis
which
is
so
destructive
to
*NL*
plants
growing
in
a
damp
soil
.
And
yet
it
was
not
because
the
damp
*NL*
had
been
excluded
from
the
garden
;
the
earth
,
black
as
soot
,
the
*NL*
thick
foliage
of
the
trees
betrayed
its
presence
;
besides
,
had
natural
*NL*
humidity
been
wanting
,
it
could
have
been
immediately
supplied
by
*NL*
artificial
means
,
thanks
to
a
tank
of
water
,
sunk
in
one
of
the
corners
*NL*
of
the
garden
,
and
upon
which
were
stationed
a
frog
and
a
toad
,
who
,
*NL*
from
antipathy
,
no
doubt
,
always
remained
on
the
two
opposite
sides
of
*NL*
the
basin
.
There
was
not
a
blade
of
grass
to
be
seen
in
the
paths
,
or
*NL*
a
weed
in
the
flower-beds
;
no
fine
lady
ever
trained
and
watered
her
*NL*
geraniums
,
her
cacti
,
and
her
rhododendrons
,
with
more
pains
than
this
*NL*
hitherto
unseen
gardener
bestowed
upon
his
little
enclosure
.
Monte
*NL*
Cristo
stopped
after
having
closed
the
gate
and
fastened
the
string
to
*NL*
the
nail
,
and
cast
a
look
around
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
man
at
the
telegraph
,
''
said
he
,
``
must
either
engage
a
gardener
or
*NL*
devote
himself
passionately
to
agriculture
.
''
Suddenly
he
struck
against
*NL*
something
crouching
behind
a
wheelbarrow
filled
with
leaves
;
the
*NL*
something
rose
,
uttering
an
exclamation
of
astonishment
,
and
Monte
*NL*
Cristo
found
himself
facing
a
man
about
fifty
years
old
,
who
was
*NL*
plucking
strawberries
,
which
he
was
placing
upon
grape
leaves
.
He
had
*NL*
twelve
leaves
and
about
as
many
strawberries
,
which
,
on
rising
suddenly
,
*NL*
he
let
fall
from
his
hand
.
``
You
are
gathering
your
crop
,
sir
?
''
said
*NL*
Monte
Cristo
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excuse
me
,
sir
,
''
replied
the
man
,
raising
his
hand
to
his
cap
;
``
I
am
*NL*
not
up
there
,
I
know
,
but
I
have
only
just
come
down
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
not
let
me
interfere
with
you
in
anything
,
my
friend
,
''
said
the
*NL*
count
;
``
gather
your
strawberries
,
if
,
indeed
,
there
are
any
left
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
ten
left
,
''
said
the
man
,
``
for
here
are
eleven
,
and
I
had
*NL*
twenty-one
,
five
more
than
last
year
.
But
I
am
not
surprised
;
the
spring
*NL*
has
been
warm
this
year
,
and
strawberries
require
heat
,
sir
.
This
is
the
*NL*
reason
that
,
instead
of
the
sixteen
I
had
last
year
,
I
have
this
year
,
*NL*
you
see
,
eleven
,
already
plucked
--
twelve

thirteen

fourteen

fifteen
,
*NL*
sixteen
,
seventeen

eighteen

Ah
,
I
miss
three
,
they
were
here
last
*NL*
night
,
sir
--
I
am
sure
they
were
here
--
I
counted
them
.
It
must
be
the
*NL*
Mere
Simon
's
son
who
has
stolen
them
;
I
saw
him
strolling
about
here
*NL*
this
morning
.
Ah
,
the
young
rascal
--
stealing
in
a
garden
--
he
does
not
*NL*
know
where
that
may
lead
him
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
,
it
is
wrong
,
''
said
Monte
Cristo
,
``
but
you
should
take
into
*NL*
consideration
the
youth
and
greediness
of
the
delinquent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
,
''
said
the
gardener
,
``
but
that
does
not
make
it
the
less
*NL*
unpleasant
.
But
,
sir
,
once
more
I
beg
pardon
;
perhaps
you
are
an
officer
*NL*
that
I
am
detaining
here
.

And
he
glanced
timidly
at
the
count
's
blue
*NL*
coat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Calm
yourself
,
my
friend

said
the
count
,
with
the
smile
which
he
made
*NL*
at
will
either
terrible
or
benevolent
,
and
which
now
expressed
only
the
*NL*
kindliest
feeling
;
``
I
am
not
an
inspector
,
but
a
traveller
,
brought
*NL*
here
by
a
curiosity

half
repents

,
since
he
causes
you
to
lose
your
*NL*
time

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
my
time
is
not
valuable
,
''
replied
the
man
with
a
melancholy
smile
.
*NL*
``
Still
it
belongs
to
government
,
and
I
ought
not
to
waste
it
;
but
,
*NL*
having
received
the
signal
that
I
might
rest
for
an
hour

-LRB-
here
he
*NL*
glanced
at
the
sun-dial
,
for
there
was
everything
in
the
enclosure
of
*NL*
Montlhery
,
even
a
sun-dial
-RRB-
,
``
and
having
ten
minutes
before
me

my

being
ripe
,
when
a
day
longer

by-the-by
,
sir
,
do
you
think
*NL*
dormice
eat
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
I
should
think
not
,
''
replied
Monte
Cristo
;
``
dormice
are
bad
*NL*
neighbors
for
us
who
do
not
eat
them
preserved
,
as
the
Romans
did

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
Did
the
Romans
eat
them

said
the
gardener

``
ate

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
read
so

said
the

*NL*
*NL*
``
Really

They

not

only
waking

Listen

Last
year
I
had
four
apricots
--
they
stole
one
,
I
*NL*
had
one
nectarine
,
only
one
--
well
,
sir
,
they
ate
half
of
it
on
the
wall
;
*NL*
a
splendid
nectarine

I
never
ate
a
better

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ate
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
to
say
,
the
half
that
was
left

you
understand

it
was
*NL*
exquisite

Ah

those
gentlemen
never
choose
the
worst
morsels

Mere
Simon

son

who
has
not

continued
the
horticulturist
,
``
I

take

not

Monte

had
seen
enough
.
Every
man
*NL*
has
a
devouring
passion
in
his
heart
,
as
every
fruit
has
its
worm
;
*NL*
that
of
the
telegraph
man
was
horticulture
.
He
began
gathering
the
*NL*
grape-leaves
which
screened
the
sun
from
the
grapes
,
and
won
the
heart
*NL*
of
the
gardener
.
``
Did
you
come
here
,
sir
,
to
see
the
telegraph

he

``

the

*NL*
*NL*
``
Is

to

``

Monte

entered
the
tower
,
which
was
divided
into
*NL*
three
stories
.
The
tower
contained
implements
,
such
as
spades
,
rakes
,
*NL*
watering-pots
,
hung
against
the
wall
;
this
was
all
the
furniture
.
The
*NL*
second
was
the
man
's
conventional
abode
,
or
rather
sleeping-place
;
it
*NL*
contained
a
few
poor
articles
of
household
furniture

a
bed
,
a
table
,
*NL*
two
chairs

a
stone
pitcher

and
some
dry
herbs

hung
up
to
the
ceiling

*NL*
which
the
count
recognized
as
sweet
pease
,
and
of
which
the
good
man
was
*NL*
preserving
the
seeds

he
had
labelled

*NL*
``

asked

Monte

``
The

forced

Monte

took
a
paper
from
his
pocket

*NL*
upon
which
were
drawn
three
signs

with
numbers
to
indicate
the
order
in

which
they
were
to
be
worked
.

*NL*
``

*NL*
``

The
shot
*NL*
told
;
red
with
fever
,
while
the
large
drops
fell
from
his
brow
,
the
man
*NL*
executed
,
one
after
the
other
,
the
three
signs
given
by
the
count
,
in
*NL*
spite
of
the
frightful
contortions
of
the
right-hand
correspondent
,
who
,
*NL*
not
understanding
the
change
,
began
to
think
the
gardener
had
gone
mad
.
*NL*
As
to
the
left-hand
one
,
he
conscientiously
repeated
the
same
signals
,
*NL*
which
were
finally
transmitted
to
the
Minister
of
the
Interior
.
``
Now
you
*NL*
are
rich

''
said
Monte
Cristo
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

replied
the
man
,
``
but
at
what
a
price

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
,
friend
,
''
said
Monte
Cristo
.
``
I
do
not
wish
to
cause
you
any
*NL*
remorse

believe
me
,
then
,
when
I
swear
to
you
that
you
have
wronged
no
*NL*
man

on
the
contrary
have
benefited

''
The
man
looked
at
the
*NL*
bank-notes
,
felt
them
,
counted
them
,
turned
pale
,
then
red
,
then
rushed
*NL*
into
his
room
to
drink
a
glass
of
water
,
but
he
had
no
time
to
reach
*NL*
the
water-jug
,
and
fainted
in
the
midst
of
his
dried
herbs
.
Five
minutes
*NL*
after
the
new
telegram
reached
the
minister
,
Debray
had
the
horses
put
*NL*
to
his
carriage
,
and
drove
to
Danglars
'
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
your
husband
any
Spanish
bonds
?
''
he
asked
of
the
baroness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
so
,
indeed
!
He
has
six
millions

worth

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
must
sell
them
at
whatever
price

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
Don
Carlos
has
fled
from
Bourges
,
and
has
returned
to
Spain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
know
?
''
Debray
shrugged
his
shoulders
.
``
The
idea
of
*NL*
asking
how
I
hear
the
news
,
''
he
said
.
The
baroness
did
not
wait
for
*NL*
a
repetition
;
she
ran
to
her
husband
,
who
immediately
hastened
to
his
*NL*
agent
,
and
ordered
him
to
sell
at
any
price
.
When
it
was
seen
that
*NL*
Danglars
sold
,
the
Spanish
funds
fell
directly
.
Danglars
lost
five
*NL*
hundred
thousand
francs
;
but
he
rid
himself
of
all
his
Spanish
shares
.
*NL*
The
same
evening
the
following
was
read
in
Le
Messager
:
*NL*
*NL*
''
-LSB-
By
telegraph
.
-RSB-
The
king
,
Don
Carlos
,
has
escaped
the
vigilance
of
*NL*
his
guardians
at
Bourges
,
and
has
returned
to
Spain
by
the
Catalonian
*NL*
frontier
.
Barcelona
has
risen
in
his
favor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
that
evening
nothing
was
spoken
of
but
the
foresight
of
Danglars
,
*NL*
who
had
sold
his
shares
,
and
of
the
luck
of
the
stock-jobber
,
who
only
*NL*
lost
five
hundred
thousand
francs
by
such
a
blow
.
Those
who
had
kept
*NL*
their
shares
,
or
bought
those
of
Danglars
,
looked
upon
themselves
as
*NL*
ruined
,
and
passed
a
very
bad
night
.
Next
morning
Le
Moniteur
contained
*NL*
the
following
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
without
any
foundation
that
Le
Messager
yesterday
announced
the
*NL*
flight
of
Don
Carlos
and
the
revolt
of
Barcelona
.
The
king
-LRB-
Don
Carlos
-RRB-
*NL*
has
not
left
Bourges
,
and
the
peninsula
is
in
the
enjoyment
of
profound
*NL*
peace
.
A
telegraphic
signal
,
improperly
interpreted
,
owing
to
the
fog
,
*NL*
was
the
cause
of
this
error
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
funds
rose
one
per
cent
higher
than
before
they
had
fallen
.
This
,
*NL*
reckoning
his
loss
,
and
what
he
had
missed
gaining
,
made
the
difference
*NL*
of
a
million
to
Danglars
.
``
Good
,
''
said
Monte
Cristo
to
Morrel
,
who
was
*NL*
at
his
house
when
the
news
arrived
of
the
strange
reverse
of
fortune
of
*NL*
which
Danglars
had
been
the
victim
,
``
I
have
just
made
a
discovery
for

twenty-five
thousand

I
would
have
paid

asked
Morrel

to
be
altered
*NL*
outside
.
The
splendor
was
within
.
Indeed
,
almost
before
the
door
*NL*
opened
,
the
scene
changed
.
M.
Bertuccio
had
outdone
himself
in
the
taste
*NL*
displayed
in
furnishing
,
and
in
the
rapidity
with
which
it
was
executed
.
*NL*
It
is
told
that
the
Duc
d'Antin
removed
in
a
single
night
a
whole
avenue
*NL*
of
trees
that
annoyed
Louis
XIV.
;
in
three
days
M.
Bertuccio
planted
an
*NL*
entirely
bare
court
with
poplars
,
large
spreading
sycamores
to
shade
*NL*
the
different
parts
of
the
house
,
and
in
the
foreground
,
instead
of
the
*NL*
usual
paving-stones
,
half
hidden
by
the
grass
,
there
extended
a
lawn
but
*NL*
that
morning
laid
down
,
and
upon
which
the
water
was
yet
glistening
.
For
*NL*
the
rest
,
the
orders
had
been
issued
by
the
count
;
he
himself
had
given
*NL*
a
plan
to
Bertuccio
,
marking
the
spot
where
each
tree
was
to
be
planted
,
*NL*
and
the
shape
and
extent
of
the
lawn
which
was
to
take
the
place
of
the
*NL*
paving-stones
.
Thus
the
house
had
become
unrecognizable
,
and
Bertuccio
*NL*
himself
declared
that
he
scarcely
knew
it
,
encircled
as
it
was
by
a
*NL*
framework
of
trees
.
The
overseer
would
not
have
objected
,
while
he
was
*NL*
about
it
,
to
have
made
some
improvements
in
the
garden
,
but
the
count
*NL*
had
positively
forbidden
it
to
be
touched
.
Bertuccio
made
amends
,
*NL*
however
,
by
loading
the
ante-chambers
,
staircases
,
and
mantle-pieces
*NL*
with
flowers
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
,
above
all
,
manifested
the
shrewdness
of
the
steward
,
and
the
*NL*
profound
science
of
the
master
,
the
one
in
carrying
out
the
ideas
of
the
*NL*
other
,
was
that
this
house
which
appeared
only
the
night
before
so
sad
*NL*
and
gloomy
,
impregnated
with
that
sickly
smell
one
can
almost
fancy
to
*NL*
be
the
smell
of
time
,
had
in
a
single
day
acquired
the
aspect
of
life
,
*NL*
was
scented
with
its
master
's
favorite
perfumes
,
and
had
the
very
light
*NL*
regulated
according
to
his
wish
.
When
the
count
arrived
,
he
had
*NL*
under
his
touch
his
books
and
arms
,
his
eyes
rested
upon
his
favorite
*NL*
pictures
;
his
dogs
,
whose
caresses
he
loved
,
welcomed
him
in
the
*NL*
ante-chamber
;
the
birds
,
whose
songs
delighted
him
,
cheered
him
with
*NL*
their
music
;
and
the
house
,
awakened
from
its
long
sleep
,
like
the
*NL*
sleeping
beauty
in
the
wood
,
lived
,
sang
,
and
bloomed
like
the
houses
we
*NL*
have
long
cherished
,
and
in
which
,
when
we
are
forced
to
leave
them
,
*NL*
we
leave
a
part
of
our
souls
.
The
servants
passed
gayly
along
the
fine
*NL*
court-yard
;
some
,
belonging
to
the
kitchens
,
gliding
down
the
stairs
,
*NL*
restored
but
the
previous
day
,
as
if
they
had
always
inhabited
the
*NL*
house
;
others
filling
the
coach-houses
,
where
the
equipages
,
encased
and
*NL*
numbered
,
appeared
to
have
been
installed
for
the
last
fifty
years
;
and
*NL*
in
the
stables
the
horses
replied
with
neighs
to
the
grooms
,
who
spoke
*NL*
to
them
with
much
more
respect
than
many
servants
pay
their
masters
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
library
was
divided
into
two
parts
on
either
side
of
the
wall
,
and
*NL*
contained
upwards
of
two
thousand
volumes
;
one
division
was
entirely
*NL*
devoted
to
novels
,
and
even
the
volume
which
had
been
published
but
the
*NL*
day
before
was
to
be
seen
in
its
place
in
all
the
dignity
of
its
red
and
*NL*
gold
binding
.
On
the
other
side
of
the
house
,
to
match
with
the
library
,
*NL*
was
the
conservatory
,
ornamented
with
rare
flowers
,
that
bloomed
in
*NL*
china
jars
;
and
in
the
midst
of
the
greenhouse
,
marvellous
alike
to
*NL*
sight
and
smell
,
was
a
billiard-table
which
looked
as
if
it
had
been
*NL*
abandoned
during
the
past
hour
by
players
who
had
left
the
balls
on
*NL*
the
cloth
.
One
chamber
alone
had
been
respected
by
the
magnificent
*NL*
Bertuccio
.
Before
this
room
,
to
which
you
could
ascend
by
the
grand
,
and
*NL*
go
out
by
the
back
staircase
,
the
servants
passed
with
curiosity
,
and
*NL*
Bertuccio
with
terror
.
At
five
o'clock
precisely
,
the
count
arrived
*NL*
before
the
house
at
Auteuil
,
followed
by
Ali
.
Bertuccio
was
awaiting
*NL*
this
arrival
with
impatience
,
mingled
with
uneasiness
;
he
hoped
for
some
*NL*
compliments
,
while
,
at
the
same
time
,
he
feared
to
have
frowns
.
Monte
*NL*
Cristo
descended
into
the
courtyard
,
walked
all
over
the
house
,
without
*NL*
giving
any
sign
of
approbation
or
pleasure
,
until
he
entered
his
*NL*
bedroom
,
situated
on
the
opposite
side
to
the
closed
room
;
then
he
*NL*
approached
a
little
piece
of
furniture
,
made
of
rosewood
,
which
he
had
*NL*
noticed
at
a
previous
visit
.
``
That
can
only
be
to
hold
gloves
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
your
excellency
deign
to
open
it
?
''
said
the
delighted
Bertuccio
,
*NL*
``
and
you
will
find
gloves
in
it
.
''
Elsewhere
the
count
found
everything
*NL*
he
required
--
smelling-bottles
,
cigars
,
knick-knacks
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
,
''
he
said
;
and
M.
Bertuccio
left
enraptured
,
so
great
,
so
*NL*
powerful
,
and
real
was
the
influence
exercised
by
this
man
over
all
who
*NL*
surrounded
him
.
At
precisely
six
o'clock
the
clatter
of
horses
'
hoofs
*NL*
was
heard
at
the
entrance
door
;
it
was
our
captain
of
Spahis
,
who
had
*NL*
arrived
on
Medeah
.
``
I
am
sure
I
am
the
first
,
''
cried
Morrel
;
``
I
did
it
*NL*
on
purpose
to
have
you
a
minute
to
myself
,
before
every
one
came
.
Julie
*NL*
and
Emmanuel
have
a
thousand
things
to
tell
you
.
Ah
,
really
this
is
*NL*
magnificent
!
But
tell
me
,
count
,
will
your
people
take
care
of
my
*NL*
horse
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
not
alarm
yourself
,
my
dear
Maximilian
--
they
understand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
mean
,
because
he
wants
petting
.
If
you
had
seen
at
what
a
pace
he
*NL*
came
--
like
the
wind
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
think
so
,
--
a
horse
that
cost
5,000
francs
!
''
said
Monte
Cristo
,
*NL*
in
the
tone
which
a
father
would
use
towards
a
son
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
regret
them
?
''
asked
Morrel
,
with
his
open
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
?
Certainly
not
,
''
replied
the
count
.
``
No
;
I
should
only
regret
if
the
*NL*
horse
had
not
proved
good
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
so
good
,
that
I
have
distanced
M.
de
Chateau-Renaud
,
one
of
the
*NL*
best
riders
in
France
,
and
M.
Debray
,
who
both
mount
the
minister
's
*NL*
Arabians
;
and
close
on
their
heels
are
the
horses
of
Madame
Danglars
,
*NL*
who
always
go
at
six
leagues
an
hour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
they
follow
you
?
''
asked
Monte
Cristo
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
See
,
they
are
here
.
''
And
at
the
same
minute
a
carriage
with
smoking
*NL*
horses
,
accompanied
by
two
mounted
gentlemen
,
arrived
at
the
gate
,
which
*NL*
opened
before
them
.
The
carriage
drove
round
,
and
stopped
at
the
steps
,
*NL*
followed
by
the
horsemen
.
The
instant
Debray
had
touched
the
ground
,
*NL*
he
was
at
the
carriage-door
.
He
offered
his
hand
to
the
baroness
,
who
,
*NL*
descending
,
took
it
with
a
peculiarity
of
manner
imperceptible
to
every
*NL*
one
but
Monte
Cristo
.
But
nothing
escaped
the
count
's
notice
,
and
he
*NL*
observed
a
little
note
,
passed
with
the
facility
that
indicates
frequent
*NL*
practice
,
from
the
hand
of
Madame
Danglars
to
that
of
the
minister
's
*NL*
secretary
.
After
his
wife
the
banker
descended
,
as
pale
as
though
he
had
*NL*
issued
from
his
tomb
instead
of
his
carriage
.
Madame
Danglars
threw
*NL*
a
rapid
and
inquiring
glance
which
could
only
be
interpreted
by
Monte
*NL*
Cristo
,
around
the
court-yard
,
over
the
peristyle
,
and
across
the
front
*NL*
of
the
house
,
then
,
repressing
a
slight
emotion
,
which
must
have
been
*NL*
seen
on
her
countenance
if
she
had
not
kept
her
color
,
she
ascended
the
*NL*
steps
,
saying
to
Morrel
,
``
Sir
,
if
you
were
a
friend
of
mine
,
I
should
*NL*
ask
you
if
you
would
sell
your
horse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Morrel
smiled
with
an
expression
very
like
a
grimace
,
and
then
turned
*NL*
round
to
Monte
Cristo
,
as
if
to
ask
him
to
extricate
him
from
his
*NL*
embarrassment
.
The
count
understood
him
.
``
Ah
,
madame
,
''
he
said
,
``
why
did
*NL*
you
not
make
that
request
of
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
you
,
sir
,
''
replied
the
baroness
,
``
one
can
wish
for
nothing
,
one
is
*NL*
so
sure
to
obtain
it
.
If
it
were
so
with
M.
Morrel
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Unfortunately
,
''
replied
the
count
,
``
I
am
witness
that
M.
Morrel
can
not
*NL*
give
up
his
horse
,
his
honor
being
engaged
in
keeping
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
laid
a
wager
he
would
tame
Medeah
in
the
space
of
six
months
.
You
*NL*
understand
now
that
if
he
were
to
get
rid
of
the
animal
before
the
*NL*
time
named
,
he
would
not
only
lose
his
bet
,
but
people
would
say
he
was
*NL*
afraid
;
and
a
brave
captain
of
Spahis
can
not
risk
this
,
even
to
*NL*
gratify
a
pretty
woman
,
which
is
,
in
my
opinion
,
one
of
the
most
sacred
*NL*
obligations
in
the
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
my
position
,
madame
,
''
said
Morrel
,
bestowing
a
grateful
smile
*NL*
on
Monte
Cristo
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
seems
to
me
,
''
said
Danglars
,
in
his
coarse
tone
,
ill-concealed
by
a
*NL*
forced
smile
,
``
that
you
have
already
got
horses
enough
.
''
Madame
Danglars
*NL*
seldom
allowed
remarks
of
this
kind
to
pass
unnoticed
,
but
,
to
the
*NL*
surprise
of
the
young
people
,
she
pretended
not
to
hear
it
,
and
said
*NL*
nothing
.
Monte
Cristo
smiled
at
her
unusual
humility
,
and
showed
her
two
*NL*
immense
porcelain
jars
,
over
which
wound
marine
plants
,
of
a
size
and
*NL*
delicacy
that
nature
alone
could
produce
.
The
baroness
was
astonished
.
*NL*
``
Why
,
''
said
she
,
``
you
could
plant
one
of
the
chestnut-trees
in
the
*NL*
Tuileries
inside
!
How
can
such
enormous
jars
have
been
manufactured
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
madame
,
''
replied
Monte
Cristo
,
``
you
must
not
ask
of
us
,
the
*NL*
manufacturers
of
fine
porcelain
,
such
a
question
.
It
is
the
work
of
*NL*
another
age
,
constructed
by
the
genii
of
earth
and
water
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
so
?
--
at
what
period
can
that
have
been
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
know
;
I
have
only
heard
that
an
emperor
of
China
had
an
*NL*
oven
built
expressly
,
and
that
in
this
oven
twelve
jars
like
this
were
*NL*
successively
baked
.
Two
broke
,
from
the
heat
of
the
fire
;
the
other
ten
*NL*
were
sunk
three
hundred
fathoms
deep
into
the
sea
.
The
sea
,
knowing
*NL*
what
was
required
of
her
,
threw
over
them
her
weeds
,
encircled
them
with
*NL*
coral
,
and
encrusted
them
with
shells
;
the
whole
was
cemented
by
two
*NL*
hundred
years
beneath
these
almost
impervious
depths
,
for
a
revolution
*NL*
carried
away
the
emperor
who
wished
to
make
the
trial
,
and
only
left
the
*NL*
documents
proving
the
manufacture
of
the
jars
and
their
descent
into
the
*NL*
sea
.
At
the
end
of
two
hundred
years
the
documents
were
found
,
and
they
*NL*
thought
of
bringing
up
the
jars
.
Divers
descended
in
machines
,
made
*NL*
expressly
on
the
discovery
,
into
the
bay
where
they
were
thrown
;
but
of
*NL*
ten
three
only
remained
,
the
rest
having
been
broken
by
the
waves
.
I
am
*NL*
fond
of
these
jars
,
upon
which
,
perhaps
,
misshapen
,
frightful
monsters
*NL*
have
fixed
their
cold
,
dull
eyes
,
and
in
which
myriads
of
small
fish
*NL*
have
slept
,
seeking
a
refuge
from
the
pursuit
of
their
enemies
.
''
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
Danglars
,
who
had
cared
little
for
curiosities
,
was
*NL*
mechanically
tearing
off
the
blossoms
of
a
splendid
orange-tree
,
one
*NL*
after
another
.
When
he
had
finished
with
the
orange-tree
,
he
began
at
*NL*
the
cactus
;
but
this
,
not
being
so
easily
plucked
as
the
orange-tree
,
*NL*
pricked
him
dreadfully
.
He
shuddered
,
and
rubbed
his
eyes
as
though
*NL*
awaking
from
a
dream
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir

''
said
Monte
Cristo
to
him
,
``
I
do
not
recommend
my

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

refused

Chateau-Renaud

A
black
satin
stock

fresh
from
the

gray

moustaches

a
bold
eye

a
major

uniform

ornamented
with
three
medals
*NL*
and
five

in

the
thorough
bearing
of
an
old

such
*NL*
was
the
appearance
of
Major
Bartolomeo
Cavalcanti
,
that
tender
father
*NL*
with
whom
we
are
already
acquainted

Close
to
him
,
dressed
in
entirely
*NL*
new
clothes
,
advanced
smilingly
Count
Andrea
Cavalcanti
,
the
dutiful
*NL*
son
,
whom
we
also
know

The
three
young
people
were
talking
together
.
On
*NL*
the
entrance
of
the
new-comers
,
their
eyes
glanced
from
father
to
*NL*
son
,
and
then
,
naturally
enough
,
rested
on
the
latter
,
whom
they
began
*NL*
criticising
.
``
Cavalcanti
!

said
Debray

``
A
fine

Morrel

*NL*

But
they
appear

Danglars

*NL*

shrugging
his

*NL*
Madame

looked
at
her
husband
with
an
expression
which
,
at
any
*NL*
other
time
,
would
have
indicated
a
storm
,
but
for
the
second
time
she
*NL*
controlled
herself
.
``
The
baron

thoughtful
to-day

Monte

to
her
;

are
they
going

ministry

*NL*
*NL*
``
Not

*NL*
*NL*
``
M.

cried
Baptistin

They
entered

M.
de
*NL*
Villefort
,
notwithstanding
his
self-control
,
was
visibly
affected
,
and
*NL*
when
Monte
Cristo
touched
his
hand
,
he
felt
it
tremble
.
``
Certainly

*NL*
women

said
Monte

to
himself
,
*NL*
glancing
at
Madame
Danglars
,
who
was
smiling
on
the
procureur

and
*NL*
embracing
his

After
a
short
time
,
the
count
saw
Bertuccio

had
been
occupied
on

glide

He
went
to
him

his

*NL*
``

Bertuccio

without

pointed

with
something
of
the
gesture
Macbeth
uses
to
point
out
Banquo

``
Oh

at

No

Instead

you

You
went

young

in

turning

This
time
Bertuccio
would
have
uttered
an
exclamation

not
a

silenced
him

``

*NL*
and
he
returned
to
his
guests

while
Bertuccio
,
leaning
against
the
*NL*
wall
,
succeeded
in
reaching
the
dining-room
.
Five
minutes
afterwards
*NL*
the
doors
of
the
drawing-room
were
thrown
open
,
and
Bertuccio
appearing
*NL*
said
,
with
a
violent
effort
,
``
The
dinner
waits

*NL*
*NL*
The
Count
of
Monte

offered
his
arm
to
Madame
de
Villefort
.
``
M.
de

Villefort

he
said
,
``
will
you
conduct

complied

they
passed
on

Chapter
63
.
The
Dinner
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
evident
that
one
sentiment
affected
all
the
guests
on
entering
*NL*
the
dining-room
.
Each
one
asked
what
strange
influence
had
brought
them
*NL*
to
this
house
,
and
yet
astonished
,
even
uneasy
though
they
were
,
they
*NL*
still
felt
that
they
would
not
like
to
be
absent
.
The
recent
events
,
the
*NL*
solitary
and
eccentric
position
of
the
count
,
his
enormous
,
nay
,
almost
*NL*
incredible
fortune
,
should
have
made
men
cautious
,
and
have
altogether
*NL*
prevented
ladies
visiting
a
house
where
there
was
no
one
of
their
own
*NL*
sex
to
receive
them
;
and
yet
curiosity
had
been
enough
to
lead
them
*NL*
to
overleap
the
bounds
of
prudence
and
decorum
.
And
all
present
,
even
*NL*
including
Cavalcanti
and
his
son
,
notwithstanding
the
stiffness
of
*NL*
the
one
and
the
carelessness
of
the
other
,
were
thoughtful
,
on
finding
*NL*
themselves
assembled
at
the
house
of
this
incomprehensible
man
.
Madame
*NL*
Danglars
had
started
when
Villefort
,
on
the
count
's
invitation
,
offered
*NL*
his
arm
;
and
Villefort
felt
that
his
glance
was
uneasy
beneath
his
gold
*NL*
spectacles
,
when
he
felt
the
arm
of
the
baroness
press
upon
his
own
.
*NL*
None
of
this
had
escaped
the
count
,
and
even
by
this
mere
contact
of
*NL*
individuals
the
scene
had
already
acquired
considerable
interest
for
an
*NL*
observer
.
M.
de
Villefort
had
on
the
right
hand
Madame
Danglars
,
on
*NL*
his
left
Morrel
.
The
count
was
seated
between
Madame
de
Villefort
and
*NL*
Danglars
;
the
other
seats
were
filled
by
Debray
,
who
was
placed
between
*NL*
the
two
Cavalcanti
,
and
by
Chateau-Renaud
,
seated
between
Madame
de
*NL*
Villefort
and
Morrel
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
repast
was
magnificent
;
Monte
Cristo
had
endeavored
completely
to
*NL*
overturn
the
Parisian
ideas
,
and
to
feed
the
curiosity
as
much
as
the
*NL*
appetite
of
his
guests
.
It
was
an
Oriental
feast
that
he
offered
to
*NL*
them
,
but
of
such
a
kind
as
the
Arabian
fairies
might
be
supposed
to
*NL*
prepare
.
Every
delicious
fruit
that
the
four
quarters
of
the
globe
could
*NL*
provide
was
heaped
in
vases
from
China
and
jars
from
Japan
.
Rare
birds
,
*NL*
retaining
their
most
brilliant
plumage
,
enormous
fish
,
spread
upon
*NL*
massive
silver
dishes
,
together
with
every
wine
produced
in
the
*NL*
Archipelago
,
Asia
Minor
,
or
the
Cape
,
sparkling
in
bottles
,
whose
*NL*
grotesque
shape
seemed
to
give
an
additional
flavor
to
the
draught
,
--
all
*NL*
these
,
like
one
of
the
displays
with
which
Apicius
of
old
gratified
his
*NL*
guests
,
passed
in
review
before
the
eyes
of
the
astonished
Parisians
,
*NL*
who
understood
that
it
was
possible
to
expend
a
thousand
louis
upon
a
*NL*
dinner
for
ten
persons
,
but
only
on
the
condition
of
eating
pearls
,
like
*NL*
Cleopatra
,
or
drinking
refined
gold
,
like
Lorenzo
de
'
Medici
.
*NL*
*NL*
Monte
Cristo
noticed
the
general
astonishment
,
and
began
laughing
*NL*
and
joking
about
it
.
``
Gentlemen
,
''
he
said
,
``
you
will
admit
that
,
when
*NL*
arrived
at
a
certain
degree
of
fortune
,
the
superfluities
of
life
are
*NL*
all
that
can
be
desired
;
and
the
ladies
will
allow
that
,
after
having
*NL*
risen
to
a
certain
eminence
of
position
,
the
ideal
alone
can
be
*NL*
more
exalted
.
Now
,
to
follow
out
this
reasoning
,
what
is
the
*NL*
marvellous
?
--
that
which
we
do
not
understand
.
What
is
it
that
we
really
*NL*
desire
?
--
that
which
we
can
not
obtain
.
Now
,
to
see
things
which
I
can
not
*NL*
understand
,
to
procure
impossibilities
,
these
are
the
study
of
my
life
.
*NL*
I
gratify
my
wishes
by
two
means
--
my
will
and
my
money
.
I
take
as
*NL*
much
interest
in
the
pursuit
of
some
whim
as
you
do
,
M.
Danglars
,
in
*NL*
promoting
a
new
railway
line
;
you
,
M.
de
Villefort
,
in
condemning
a
*NL*
culprit
to
death
;
you
,
M.
Debray
,
in
pacifying
a
kingdom
;
you
,
M.
de
*NL*
Chateau-Renaud
,
in
pleasing
a
woman
;
and
you
,
Morrel
,
in
breaking
a
*NL*
horse
that
no
one
can
ride
.
For
example
,
you
see
these
two
fish
;
one
*NL*
brought
from
fifty
leagues
beyond
St.
Petersburg
,
the
other
five
leagues
*NL*
from
Naples
.
Is
it
not
amusing
to
see
them
both
on
the
same
table
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
the
two
fish
?
''
asked
Danglars
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
M.
Chateau-Renaud
,
who
has
lived
in
Russia

will
tell
you
the
name

Major
Cavalcanti

is
an
Italian

tell
you
the

other

This

Chateau-Renaud

``
Sterlets

Chateau-Renaud
,
``
are
only
found
in

``
And

Cavalcanti
,
``
I
know

Fusaro
alone
supplies
lampreys
*NL*
of
that
size

*NL*
*NL*
``
Exactly

one
comes
from
the
Volga
,
and
the
other
from
Lake
Fusaro

*NL*
*NL*
``
Impossible
!
''
cried
all
the
guests
simultaneously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
this
is
just
what
amuses
me

said
Monte
Cristo
.
``
I
am
like

Nero

cupitor

is
what

seems

exquisite

is
very
likely
no

better
than
perch

it

impossible

here
it

But
how
could
you
have
these
fish
brought
to
France
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
nothing
more
easy
.
Each
fish
was
brought
over
in
a
cask
--
one
filled
*NL*
with
river
herbs
and
weeds
,
the
other
with
rushes
and
lake
plants
;
they
*NL*
were
placed
in
a
wagon
built
on
purpose
,
and
thus
the
sterlet
lived
*NL*
twelve
days
,
the
lamprey
eight
,
and
both
were
alive
when
my
cook
seized
*NL*
them
,
killing
one
with
milk
and
the
other
with
wine

You
do
not
believe
*NL*
me
,
M.
Danglars
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
help
doubting

answered
Danglars
with
his
stupid
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Baptistin

said
the
count

the
other
fish
brought
in

the
*NL*
sterlet

the
lamprey
which
came
in
the
other
casks

and
which
are
yet
*NL*
alive
.
''
Danglars
opened
his
bewildered
eyes
;
the
company
clapped
their
*NL*
hands
.
Four
servants
carried
in
two
casks
covered
with
aquatic
plants
,
*NL*
and
in
each
of
which
was
breathing
a
fish
similar
to
those
on
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why
have
two
of
each
sort
?
''
asked
Danglars
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Merely
because
one
might
have
died

carelessly
answered
Monte
Cristo
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
certainly
an
extraordinary
man
,
''
said
Danglars
;
``
and
*NL*
philosophers
may
well
say
it
is
a
fine
thing
to
be
rich
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
to
have
ideas
,
''
added
Madame
Danglars
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
do
not
give
me
credit
for
this
,
madame
;
it
was
done
by
the
Romans
,
*NL*
who
much
esteemed
them
,
and
Pliny
relates
that
they
sent
slaves
from
*NL*
Ostia
to
Rome
,
who
carried
on
their
heads
fish
which
he
calls
the
mulus
,
*NL*
and
which
,
from
the
description
,
must
probably
be
the
goldfish
.
It
was
*NL*
also
considered
a
luxury
to
have
them
alive
,
it
being
an
amusing
sight
*NL*
to
see
them
die
,
for
,
when
dying
,
they
change
color
three
or
four
times
,
*NL*
and
like
the
rainbow
when
it
disappears
,
pass
through
all
the
prismatic
*NL*
shades
,
after
which
they
were
sent
to
the
kitchen
.
Their
agony
formed
*NL*
part
of
their
merit
--
if
they
were
not
seen
alive

they
were
despised
*NL*
when
dead

*NL*
*NL*

Yes

then
Ostia
is
only
a
few
leagues
from
Rome

*NL*
*NL*

True

Monte

what
would
be
the
use

living
eighteen

hundred
years
after
Lucullus

if
we
can
do
no
better
than
he
could

The
*NL*
two
Cavalcanti
opened
their
enormous
eyes
,
but
had
the
good
sense
not
*NL*
to
say
anything
.

All
this
is
very
extraordinary

said
Chateau-Renaud

,
what
I
admire
the
most

I
confess

is
the
marvellous
promptitude

which
your

are
executed

Is
it
not
true

bought

five

transformed

If
I
remember
*NL*
rightly
,
it
had
another
entrance
,
and
the
court-yard
was
paved
and
*NL*
empty
;
while
to-day
we
have
a
splendid
lawn

bordered
by
trees

appear
to
be
a
hundred
years

*NL*
*NL*

am
fond

Madame
de

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

madame

I
preferred

*NL*
*NL*

In

extraordinary

Chateau-Renaud

it
seems
quite
miraculous

make
a
new

house
out
of
an
old
one

for
it
was
very
old
,
and
dull
too

I
recollect
*NL*
coming
for
my
mother
to
look
at
it
when
M.

advertised
it
*NL*
for
sale
two
or
three
years
ago

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
M.

said
Madame

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
appears
so
,

replied
Monte

*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
possible
that
you
do
not
know
of
whom
you
purchased
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
so
;
my
steward
transacts
all
this
business
for
me

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
certainly
ten
years
since
the
house
had
been
occupied

said
*NL*
Chateau-Renaud
,

it
was
quite
melancholy
to
look
at
it

with
the

blinds
closed

the
doors
locked

the
weeds
in
the
court

Really
,
if
*NL*
the
house
had
not
belonged
to
the
father-in-law
of
the
procureur

one
*NL*
might

thought
it
some
accursed
place

a
horrible
crime

been
committed

Villefort
,
who
had
hitherto
not
tasted
the
three
or
*NL*
four
glasses
of
rare
wine
which
were
placed
before
him
,
here
took
one
,
*NL*
and
drank
it
off
.
Monte
Cristo
allowed
a
short
time
to
elapse
,
and
then
*NL*
said
,
``
It
is
singular
,
baron
,
but
the
same
idea
came
across
me
the
first
*NL*
time
I
came
here

it
looked
so
gloomy
I
should
never
have
bought
it
*NL*
if
my
steward
had
not
taken
the
matter
into
his
own
hands

Perhaps
the
*NL*
fellow
had
been
bribed
by
the
notary
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
probable

stammered
out
Villefort
,
trying
to
smile
;
``
but
I
can
*NL*
assure
you
that
I
had
nothing
to
do
with
any
such
proceeding

This
house

is
part
of
Valentine
's
marriage-portion
,

M.

Saint-Meran
wished
to
*NL*
sell
it
;
for
if
it

remained
another

two
uninhabited
it
would
*NL*
have
fallen
to
ruin

It
was
Morrel
's
turn
to
become
pale
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
was
,
above
all
,
one
room
,
''
continued
Monte

,
``
very
plain
in
*NL*
appearance
,
hung
with
red
damask
,
which
,
I
know
not
why

appeared
to
me
*NL*
quite
dramatic

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
so

Danglars
;
``
why

*NL*
*NL*
``
Can

Are
there
not
some

places

breathe
sadness

other

no

After

Monte
Cristo
looked
*NL*
inquiringly
at
his
guests
.
Madame
de
Villefort
rose
,
Monte
Cristo
did
*NL*
the
same
,
and
the
rest
followed
their
example
.
Villefort
and
Madame
*NL*
Danglars
remained
for
a
moment
,
as
if
rooted
to
their
seats
;
they
*NL*
questioned
each
other
with
vague
and
stupid
glances
.
``
Did
you
hear
?
''
*NL*
said
Madame
Danglars
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
Elisabeth
de
Rossan
,
Marquise
de
Ganges
,
was
one
of
the
*NL*
famous
women
of
the
court
of
Louis
XIV
.
where
she
was
known
*NL*
as
``
La
Belle
Provencale

''
She
was
the
widow
of
the
Marquise
*NL*
de
Castellane
when
she
married
de
Ganges
,
and
having
the
*NL*
misfortune
to
excite
the
enmity
of
her
new
brothers-in-law
,
*NL*
was
forced
by
them
to
take
poison
;
and
they
finished
her
off
*NL*
with
pistol
and
dagger
.
--
Ed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
must
go
,
''
replied
Villefort
,
offering
his
arm
.
The
others
,
attracted
*NL*
by
curiosity
,
were
already
scattered
in
different
parts
of
the
house
;
*NL*
for
they
thought
the
visit
would
not
be
limited
to
the
one
room
,
and
*NL*
that
,
at
the
same
time
,
they
would
obtain
a
view
of
the
rest
of
the
*NL*
building
,
of
which
Monte
Cristo
had
created
a
palace
.
Each
one
went
out
*NL*
by
the
open
doors
.
Monte
Cristo
waited
for
the
two
who
remained
;
then
,
*NL*
when
they
had
passed
,
he
brought
up
the
rear
,
and
on
his
face
was
a
*NL*
smile
,
which
,
if
they
could
have
understood
it
,
would
have
alarmed
them
*NL*
much
more
than
a
visit
to
the
room
they
were
about
to
enter
.
They
began
*NL*
by
walking
through
the
apartments
,
many
of
which
were
fitted
up
in
*NL*
the
Eastern
style
,
with
cushions
and
divans
instead
of
beds
,
and
pipes
*NL*
instead
of
furniture
.
The
drawing-rooms
were
decorated
with
the
rarest
*NL*
pictures
by
the
old
masters
,
the
boudoirs
hung
with
draperies
from
*NL*
China
,
of
fanciful
colors
,
fantastic
design
,
and
wonderful
texture
.
At
*NL*
length
they
arrived
at
the
famous
room
.
There
was
nothing
particular
*NL*
about
it
,
excepting
that
,
although
daylight
had
disappeared
,
it
was
not
*NL*
lighted
,
and
everything
in
it
was
old-fashioned
,
while
the
rest
of
the
*NL*
rooms
had
been
redecorated
.
These
two
causes
were
enough
to
give
it
*NL*
a
gloomy
aspect
.
``
Oh
.
''
cried
Madame
de
Villefort
,
``
it
is
really
*NL*
frightful
.
''
Madame
Danglars
tried
to
utter
a
few
words
,
but
was
not
*NL*
heard
.
Many
observations
were
made
,
the
import
of
which
was
a
unanimous
*NL*
opinion
that
there
was
something
sinister
about
the
room
.
``
Is
it
not
*NL*
so
?
''
asked
Monte
Cristo
.
``
Look
at
that
large
clumsy
bed
,
hung
with
such
*NL*
gloomy
,
blood-colored
drapery
!
And
those
two
crayon
portraits
,
that
have
*NL*
faded
from
the
dampness
;
do
they
not
seem
to
say
,
with
their
pale
*NL*
lips
and
staring
eyes
,

We
have
seen

''
Villefort
became
livid
;
Madame
*NL*
Danglars
fell
into
a
long
seat
placed
near
the
chimney
.
``
Oh
,
''
said
*NL*
Madame
de
Villefort
,
smiling
,
``
are
you
courageous
enough
to
sit
down
*NL*
upon
the
very
seat
perhaps
upon
which
the
crime
was
committed

Madame
*NL*
Danglars
rose
suddenly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
then

said
Monte

,
``

there
more

said
Debray

not

agitation

Madame
Danglars
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

what
else
is
there

said
Danglars
;
``

by

Debray

*NL*
*NL*
Ever
since

had
been
mentioned

Morrel
had
been
silent

and
sad

Monte

,
``

Madame
Danglars
half
fainted
on
the
arm
of
Villefort
,
who
was
*NL*
obliged
to
support
himself
against
the
wall

red
hangings
,
a
bed
visited
by
the
goddess
*NL*
Lucina
?
And
that
mysterious
staircase
,
the
passage
through
which
,
not
*NL*
to
disturb
their
sleep
,
the
doctor
and
nurse
pass
,
or
even
the
father
*NL*
carrying
the
sleeping
child
?
''
Here
Madame
Danglars
,
instead
of
being
*NL*
calmed
by
the
soft
picture
,
uttered
a
groan
and
fainted
.
``
Madame
*NL*
Danglars
is
ill
,
''
said
Villefort
;
``
it
would
be
better
to
take
her
to
her
*NL*
carriage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
mon
Dieu
,
''
said
Monte
Cristo
,
``
and
I
have
forgotten
my
*NL*
smelling-bottle
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
mine
,
''
said
Madame
de
Villefort
;
and
she
passed
over
to
*NL*
Monte
Cristo
a
bottle
full
of
the
same
kind
of
red
liquid
whose
good
*NL*
properties
the
count
had
tested
on
Edward
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
said
Monte
Cristo
,
taking
it
from
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
she
said
,
``
at
your
advice
I
have
made
the
trial
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
have
you
succeeded
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Danglars
was
carried
into
the
adjoining
room
;
Monte
Cristo
*NL*
dropped
a
very
small
portion
of
the
red
liquid
upon
her
lips
;
she
*NL*
returned
to
consciousness
.
``
Ah
,
''
she
cried
,
``
what
a
frightful
dream
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Villefort
pressed
her
hand
to
let
her
know
it
was
not
a
dream
.
They
*NL*
looked
for
M.
Danglars
,
but
,
as
he
was
not
especially
interested
in
*NL*
poetical
ideas
,
he
had
gone
into
the
garden
,
and
was
talking
with
Major
*NL*
Cavalcanti
on
the
projected
railway
from
Leghorn
to
Florence
.
Monte
*NL*
Cristo
seemed
in
despair
.
He
took
the
arm
of
Madame
Danglars
,
and
*NL*
conducted
her
into
the
garden
,
where
they
found
Danglars
taking
coffee
*NL*
between
the
Cavalcanti
.
``
Really
,
madame
,
''
he
said
,
``
did
I
alarm
you
*NL*
much
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
sir
,
''
she
answered
;
``
but
you
know
,
things
impress
us
*NL*
differently
,
according
to
the
mood
of
our
minds
.
''
Villefort
forced
*NL*
a
laugh
.
``
And
then
,
you
know
,
''
he
said
,
``
an
idea
,
a
supposition
,
is
*NL*
sufficient
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Monte
Cristo
,
``
you
may
believe
me
if
you
like
,
but
it
is
my
*NL*
opinion
that
a
crime
has
been
committed
in
this
house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
care
,
''
said
Madame
de
Villefort
,
``
the
king
's
attorney
is
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
replied
Monte
Cristo
,
``
since
that
is
the
case
,
I
will
take
*NL*
advantage
of
his
presence
to
make
my
declaration
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
declaration
?
''
said
Villefort
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
before
witnesses
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
this
is
very
interesting
,
''
said
Debray
;
``
if
there
really
has
been
a
*NL*
crime
,
we
will
investigate
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
has
been
a
crime
,

said
Monte
Cristo
.
``
Come
this
way
,
gentlemen
;
*NL*
come
,
M.
Villefort
,
for
a
declaration
to
be
available
,
should
be
made
*NL*
before
the
competent
authorities
.
''
He
then
took
Villefort
's
arm
,
and
,
at
*NL*
the
same
time
,
holding
that
of
Madame
Danglars
under
his
own
,
he
dragged
*NL*
the
procureur
to
the
plantain-tree
,
where
the
shade
was
thickest
.
All
*NL*
the
other
guests
followed
.
``
Stay
,
''
said
Monte
Cristo
,
``
here
,
in
this
*NL*
very
spot

-LRB-
and
he
stamped
upon
the
ground
-RRB-
,
``
I
had
the
earth
dug
up
and
*NL*
fresh
mould
put
in
,
to
refresh
these
old
trees
;
well
,
my
man

digging
,
*NL*
found
a
box
,
or
rather
,
the
iron-work
of
a
box
,
in
the
midst
of
which
*NL*
was
the
skeleton
of
a
newly
born
infant
.
''
Monte
Cristo
felt
the
arm
of
*NL*
Madame
Danglars
stiffen
,
while
that
of
Villefort
trembled
.
``
A
newly
born
*NL*
infant
,
''
repeated
Debray
;
``
this
affair
becomes
serious
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Chateau-Renaud
,
``
I
was
not
wrong
just
now
then
,
when
I
*NL*
said
that
houses
had
souls
and
faces
like
men
,
and
that
their
exteriors
*NL*
carried
the
impress
of
their
characters
.
This
house
was
gloomy
because
*NL*
it
was
remorseful
:
it
was
remorseful
because
it
concealed
a
crime
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
said
it
was
a
crime
?
''
asked
Villefort
,
with
a
last
effort
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
?
is
it
not
a
crime
to
bury
a
living
child
in
a
garden
?
''
cried
Monte
*NL*
Cristo
.
``
And
pray
what
do
you
call
such
an
action
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
who
said
it
was
buried
alive
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
bury
it
there
if
it
were
dead

This

has
never
been

cemetery

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
done
to
infanticides
in
this
country
?
''
asked
Major
Cavalcanti
*NL*
innocently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
their
heads
are
soon
cut
off
,
''
said
Danglars
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
indeed
?
''
said
Cavalcanti
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
so
;
am
I
not
right
,
M.
de
Villefort
?
''
asked
Monte
Cristo
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
count
,
''
replied
Villefort
,
in
a
voice
now
scarcely
human
.
*NL*
*NL*
Monte
Cristo
,
seeing
that
the
two
persons
for
whom
he
had
prepared
this
*NL*
scene
could
scarcely
endure
it
,
and
not
wishing
to
carry
it
too
far
,
*NL*
said
,
``
Come
,
gentlemen
,
--
some
coffee
,
we
seem
to
have
forgotten
it
,
''
and
*NL*
he
conducted
the
guests
back
to
the
table
on
the
lawn
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
count
,
''
said
Madame
Danglars
,
``
I
am
ashamed
to
own
it
,
but
all
*NL*
your
frightful
stories
have
so
upset
me
,
that
I
must
beg
you
to
let
me
*NL*
sit
down
;
''
and
she
fell
into
a
chair
.
Monte
Cristo
bowed
,
and
went
*NL*
to
Madame
de
Villefort
.
``
I
think
Madame
Danglars
again
requires
your
*NL*
bottle
,
''
he
said
.
But
before
Madame
de
Villefort
could
reach
her
friend
*NL*
the
procureur
had
found
time
to
whisper
to
Madame
Danglars
,
``
I
must
*NL*
speak
to
you
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
When

*NL*
*NL*
``
To-morrow

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
In

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
be
there

At
this
moment
Madame
de
Villefort
approached
.
*NL*
``
Thanks

my
dear
friend

''
said
Madame
Danglars
,
trying
to
smile
;

it

Chapter

The
Beggar
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
evening
passed
on
;
Madame
de
Villefort
expressed
a
desire
to
return
*NL*
to
Paris
,
which
Madame
Danglars
had
not
dared
to
do
,
notwithstanding
the
*NL*
uneasiness
she
experienced
.
On
his
wife
's
request
,
M.
de
Villefort
was
*NL*
the
first
to
give
the
signal
of
departure
.
He
offered
a
seat
in
his
*NL*
landau
to
Madame
Danglars
,
that
she
might
be
under
the
care
of
his
wife
.
*NL*
As
for
M.
Danglars
,
absorbed
in
an
interesting
conversation
with
M.
*NL*
Cavalcanti
,
he
paid
no
attention
to
anything
that
was
passing
.
While
*NL*
Monte
Cristo
had
begged
the
smelling-bottle
of
Madame
de
Villefort
,
he
*NL*
had
noticed
the
approach
of
Villefort
to
Madame
Danglars
,
and
he
soon
*NL*
guessed
all
that
had
passed
between
them
,
though
the
words
had
been
*NL*
uttered
in
so
low
a
voice
as
hardly
to
be
heard
by
Madame
Danglars
.
*NL*
Without
opposing
their
arrangements
,
he
allowed
Morrel
,
Chateau-Renaud
,
*NL*
and
Debray
to
leave
on
horseback
,
and
the
ladies
in
M.
de
Villefort
's
*NL*
carriage
.
Danglars
,
more
and
more
delighted
with
Major
Cavalcanti
,
had
*NL*
offered
him
a
seat
in
his
carriage
.
Andrea
Cavalcanti
found
his
tilbury
*NL*
waiting
at
the
door
;
the
groom
,
in
every
respect
a
caricature
of
the
*NL*
English
fashion
,
was
standing
on
tiptoe
to
hold
a
large
iron-gray
horse
.
*NL*
*NL*
Andrea
had
spoken
very
little
during
dinner
;
he
was
an
intelligent
*NL*
lad
,
and
he
feared
to
utter
some
absurdity
before
so
many
grand
people
,
*NL*
amongst
whom
,
with
dilating
eyes
,
he
saw
the
king
's
attorney
.
Then
*NL*
he
had
been
seized
upon
by
Danglars
,
who
,
with
a
rapid
glance
at
the
*NL*
stiff-necked
old
major
and
his
modest
son
,
and
taking
into
consideration
*NL*
the
hospitality
of
the
count
,
made
up
his
mind
that
he
was
in
the
*NL*
society
of
some
nabob
come
to
Paris
to
finish
the
worldly
education
of
*NL*
his
heir
.
He
contemplated
with
unspeakable
delight
the
large
diamond
*NL*
which
shone
on
the
major
's
little
finger
;
for
the
major
,
like
a
*NL*
prudent
man
,
in
case
of
any
accident
happening
to
his
bank-notes
,
had
*NL*
immediately
converted
them
into
an
available
asset
.
Then
,
after
dinner
,
*NL*
on
the
pretext
of
business
,
he
questioned
the
father
and
son
upon
their
*NL*
mode
of
living
;
and
the
father
and
son
,
previously
informed
that
it
was
*NL*
through
Danglars
the
one
was
to
receive
his
48,000
francs
and
the
other
*NL*
50,000
livres
annually
,
were
so
full
of
affability
that
they
would
*NL*
have
shaken
hands
even
with
the
banker
's
servants
,
so
much
did
their
*NL*
gratitude
need
an
object
to
expend
itself
upon
.
One
thing
above
all
the
*NL*
rest
heightened
the
respect
,
nay
almost
the
veneration
,
of
Danglars
*NL*
for
Cavalcanti
.
The
latter
,
faithful
to
the
principle
of
Horace
,
nil
*NL*
admirari
,
had
contented
himself
with
showing
his
knowledge
by
declaring
*NL*
in
what
lake
the
best
lampreys
were
caught
.
Then
he
had
eaten
some
*NL*
without
saying
a
word
more
;
Danglars
,
therefore
,
concluded
that
such
*NL*
luxuries
were
common
at
the
table
of
the
illustrious
descendant
of
*NL*
the
Cavalcanti
,
who
most
likely
in
Lucca
fed
upon
trout
brought
from
*NL*
Switzerland
,
and
lobsters
sent
from
England
,
by
the
same
means
used
by
*NL*
the
count
to
bring
the
lampreys
from
Lake
Fusaro
,
and
the
sterlet
from
*NL*
the
Volga
.
Thus
it
was
with
much
politeness
of
manner
that
he
heard
*NL*
Cavalcanti
pronounce
these
words
,
``
To-morrow
,
sir
,
I
shall
have
the
*NL*
honor
of
waiting
upon
you
on
business
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
,
sir
,
''
said
Danglars
,
``
shall
be
most
happy
to
receive
you
.
''
Upon
*NL*
which
he
offered
to
take
Cavalcanti
in
his
carriage
to
the
Hotel
des
*NL*
Princes
,
if
it
would
not
be
depriving
him
of
the
company
of
his
son
.
To
*NL*
this
Cavalcanti
replied
by
saying
that
for
some
time
past
his
son
had
*NL*
lived
independently
of
him
,
that
he
had
his
own
horses
and
carriages
,
*NL*
and
that
not
having
come
together
,
it
would
not
be
difficult
for
them
*NL*
to
leave
separately
.
The
major
seated
himself
,
therefore
,
by
the
side
*NL*
of
Danglars
,
who
was
more
and
more
charmed
with
the
ideas
of
order
and
*NL*
economy
which
ruled
this
man
,
and
yet
who
,
being
able
to
allow
his
son
*NL*
60,000
francs
a
year
,
might
be
supposed
to
possess
a
fortune
of
500,000
*NL*
or
600,000
livres
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
Andrea
,
he
began
,
by
way
of
showing
off
,
to
scold
his
groom
,
who
,
*NL*
instead
of
bringing
the
tilbury
to
the
steps
of
the
house
,
had
taken
it
*NL*
to
the
outer
door
,
thus
giving
him
the
trouble
of
walking
thirty
steps
*NL*
to
reach
it
.
The
groom
heard
him
with
humility
,
took
the
bit
of
the
*NL*
impatient
animal
with
his
left
hand
,
and
with
the
right
held
out
the
*NL*
reins
to
Andrea
,
who
,
taking
them
from
him
,
rested
his
polished
boot
*NL*
lightly
on
the
step
.
At
that
moment
a
hand
touched
his
shoulder
.
The
*NL*
young
man
turned
round
,
thinking
that
Danglars
or
Monte
Cristo
had
*NL*
forgotten
something
they
wished
to
tell
him
,
and
had
returned
just
as
*NL*
they
were
starting
.
But
instead
of
either
of
these
,
he
saw
nothing
but
a
*NL*
strange
face
,
sunburnt
,
and
encircled
by
a
beard
,
with
eyes
brilliant
as
*NL*
carbuncles
,
and
a
smile
upon
the
mouth
which
displayed
a
perfect
set
*NL*
of
white
teeth
,
pointed
and
sharp
as
the
wolf
's
or
jackal
's
.
A
red
*NL*
handkerchief
encircled
his
gray
head
;
torn
and
filthy
garments
covered
*NL*
his
large
bony
limbs
,
which
seemed
as
though
,
like
those
of
a
skeleton
,
*NL*
they
would
rattle
as
he
walked
;
and
the
hand
with
which
he
leaned
upon
*NL*
the
young
man
's
shoulder
,
and
which
was
the
first
thing
Andrea
saw
,
*NL*
seemed
of
gigantic
size
.
Did
the
young
man
recognize
that
face
by
the
*NL*
light
of
the
lantern
in
his
tilbury
,
or
was
he
merely
struck
with
the
*NL*
horrible
appearance
of
his
interrogator
?
We
can
not
say
;
but
only
relate
*NL*
the
fact
that
he
shuddered
and
stepped
back
suddenly
.
``
What
do
you
want
*NL*
of
me
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pardon
me
,
my
friend
,
if
I
disturb
you
,
''
said
the
man
with
the
red
*NL*
handkerchief
,
``
but
I
want
to
speak
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
no
right
to
beg
at
night
,
''
said
the
groom
,
endeavoring
to
rid
*NL*
his
master
of
the
troublesome
intruder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
begging
,
my
fine
fellow
,
''
said
the
unknown
to
the
servant
,
*NL*
with
so
ironical
an
expression
of
the
eye
,
and
so
frightful
a
smile
,
*NL*
that
he
withdrew
;
``
I
only
wish
to
say
two
or
three
words
to
your
master
,
*NL*
who
gave
me
a
commission
to
execute
about
a
fortnight
ago
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
''
said
Andrea
,
with
sufficient
nerve
for
his
servant
not
to
*NL*
perceive
his
agitation
,
``
what
do
you
want
?
Speak
quickly
,
friend
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
said
,
in
a
low
voice
:
``
I
wish
--
I
wish
you
to
spare
me
the
walk
*NL*
back
to
Paris
.
I
am
very
tired
,
and
as
I
have
not
eaten
so
good
a
dinner
*NL*
as
you
,
I
can
scarcely
stand
.
''
The
young
man
shuddered
at
this
strange
*NL*
familiarity
.
``
Tell
me
,
''
he
said
--
``
tell
me
what
you
want
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
I
want
you
to
take
me
up
in
your
fine
carriage
,
and
carry
*NL*
me
back
.
''
Andrea
turned
pale
,
but
said
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
the
man
,
thrusting
his
hands
into
his
pockets
,
and
looking
*NL*
impudently
at
the
youth
;
``
I
have
taken
the
whim
into
my
head
;
do
you
*NL*
understand
,
Master
Benedetto
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
name
,
no
doubt
,
the
young
man
reflected
a
little
,
for
he
went
*NL*
towards
his
groom
,
saying
,
``
This
man
is
right
;
I
did
indeed
charge
him
*NL*
with
a
commission
,
the
result
of
which
he
must
tell
me
;
walk
to
the
*NL*
barrier
,
there
take
a
cab
,
that
you
may
not
be
too
late
.
''
The
surprised
*NL*
groom
retired
.
``
Let
me
at
least
reach
a
shady
spot
,
''
said
Andrea
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
as
for
that
,
I
'll
take
you
to
a
splendid
place
,
''
said
the
man
with
*NL*
the
handkerchief
;
and
taking
the
horse
's
bit
he
led
the
tilbury
where
*NL*
it
was
certainly
impossible
for
any
one
to
witness
the
honor
that
Andrea
*NL*
conferred
upon
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
think
I
want
the
glory
of
riding
in
your
fine
carriage
,
''
said
he
;
*NL*
``
oh
,
no
,
it
's
only
because
I
am
tired
,
and
also
because
I
have
a
little
*NL*
business
to
talk
over
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
step
in
,
''
said
the
young
man
.
It
was
a
pity
this
scene
had
not
*NL*
occurred
in
daylight
,
for
it
was
curious
to
see
this
rascal
throwing
*NL*
himself
heavily
down
on
the
cushion
beside
the
young
and
elegant
driver
*NL*
of
the
tilbury
.
Andrea
drove
past
the
last
house
in
the
village
without
*NL*
saying
a
word
to
his
companion
,
who
smiled
complacently
,
as
though
*NL*
well-pleased
to
find
himself
travelling
in
so
comfortable
a
vehicle
.
*NL*
Once
out
of
Auteuil
,
Andrea
looked
around
,
in
order
to
assure
himself
*NL*
that
he
could
neither
be
seen
nor
heard
,
and
then
,
stopping
the
horse
*NL*
and
crossing
his
arms
before
the
man
,
he
asked
,
--
``
Now
,
tell
me
why
you
*NL*
come
to
disturb
my
tranquillity
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
ask
you
why
you
deceived
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
have
I
deceived
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
How
,
'
do
you
ask
?
When
we
parted
at
the
Pont
du
Var
,
you
told
me
you
*NL*
were
going
to
travel
through
Piedmont
and
Tuscany
;
but
instead
of
that
,
*NL*
you
come
to
Paris
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
does
that
annoy
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
does
not
;
on
the
contrary
,
I
think
it
will
answer
my
purpose
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
,
''
said
Andrea
,
``
you
are
speculating
upon
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
fine
words
he
uses
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
warn
you
,
Master
Caderousse

that
you
are
mistaken

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

well

do
n't
be
angry
,
my
boy
;
you
know
well
enough
what
it
is
*NL*
to
be
unfortunate
;
and
misfortunes
make
us
jealous
.
I
thought
you
*NL*
were
earning
a
living
in
Tuscany
or
Piedmont
by
acting
as
facchino
or
*NL*
cicerone
,
and
I
pitied
you
sincerely
,
as
I
would
a
child
of
my
own
.
You

know
I
always
did
call
you
my
child

*NL*
*NL*
``
Come

*NL*
*NL*
``
Patience

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
patient

go
on

*NL*
*NL*
``
All
at
once
I
see
you
pass
through
the
barrier
with
a
groom

a
tilbury
,
*NL*
and
fine
new
clothes
.
You
must
have
discovered
a
mine
,
or
else
become
a
*NL*
stockbroker
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
So
that

you
confess

you
are
jealous

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

I
am
pleased

so
pleased

I

congratulate
you

as
*NL*
I
am
not
quite
properly
dressed

I
chose
my
opportunity

that
I
might
*NL*
not
compromise
you

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

and
a
fine
opportunity
you
have
chosen

exclaimed
Andrea
;
``
you
*NL*
speak
to
me
before
my
servant

*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
I
help
that

my

have
a
quick
horse

light
tilbury

are
naturally
as
slippery
as

eel

if
I
had
missed

to-night

I

had
another

*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
lucky

I
wish
I
could
say

much

I

conceal

*NL*

then
I
was
afraid
you
would
not
recognize
me

you
did

added
*NL*
Caderousse
with
his
unpleasant
smile
.
``
It
was
very
polite
of
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
Come

said
Andrea
,
``

do
you
want

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do

is
not
right

care
,
or
I
may
become
troublesome

''
This
menace
*NL*
smothered
the
young
man
's
passion
.
He
urged
the
horse
again
into
a
trot
.
*NL*
``
You
should
not
speak
so
to
an
old
friend

brought
up

Between
people

out

sparkling

avarice

becoming
more
and
more
excited

Andrea

laughing

*NL*
*NL*
``
How

*NL*

said
Caderousse
,
again
smiling
with
the
*NL*
disagreeable
expression
he
had
before
assumed

placed
ten

as
he
*NL*
had
himself
owned
,
the
reputed
son
of
Major
Cavalcanti
was
a
wilful
*NL*
fellow
.
He
drew
up
for
a
minute
,
threw
a
rapid
glance
around
him
,
and
*NL*
then
his
hand
fell
instantly
into
his
pocket
,
where
it
began
playing
*NL*
with
a
pistol
.
But
,
meanwhile
,
Caderousse
,
who
had
never
taken
his
eyes
*NL*
off
his
companion
,
passed
his
hand
behind
his
back
,
and
opened
a
long
*NL*
Spanish
knife
,
which
he
always
carried
with
him
,
to
be
ready
in
case
*NL*
of
need
.
The
two
friends
,
as
we
see
,
were
worthy
of
and
understood
one
*NL*
another
.
Andrea
's
hand
left
his
pocket
inoffensively
,
and
was
carried
*NL*
up
to
the
red
mustache
,
which
it
played
with
for
some
time
.
``
Good
*NL*
Caderousse
,
''
he
said
,
``
how
happy
you
will
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
do
my
best
,
''
said
the
inn-keeper
of
the
Pont
du
Gard
,
shutting
*NL*
up
his
knife
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
we
will
go
into
Paris
.
But
how
will
you
pass
through
the
*NL*
barrier
without
exciting
suspicion
?
It
seems
to
me
that
you
are
in
more
*NL*
danger
riding
than
on
foot
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait
,
''
said
Caderousse
,
``
we
shall
see
.
''
He
then
took
the
great-coat
*NL*
with
the
large
collar
,
which
the
groom
had
left
behind
in
the
tilbury
,
*NL*
and
put
it
on
his
back
;
then
he
took
off
Cavalcanti
's
hat
,
which
he
*NL*
placed
upon
his
own
head
,
and
finally
he
assumed
the
careless
attitude
*NL*
of
a
servant
whose
master
drives
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
tell
me
,
''
said
Andrea
,
``
am
I
to
remain
bareheaded
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pooh
,
''
said
Caderousse
;
``
it
is
so
windy
that
your
hat
can
easily
appear
*NL*
to
have
blown
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
come
;
enough
of
this
,
''
said
Cavalcanti
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
waiting
for
?
''
said
Caderousse
.
``
I
hope
I
am
not
the
*NL*
cause
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hush
,
''
said
Andrea
.
They
passed
the
barrier
without
accident
.
At
the
*NL*
first
cross
street
Andrea
stopped
his
horse
,
and
Caderousse
leaped
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
''
said
Andrea
,
--
``
my
servant
's
coat
and
my
hat
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
said
Caderousse
,
``
you
would
not
like
me
to
risk
taking
cold
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
am
I
to
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
?
Oh
,
you
are
young
while
I
am
beginning
to
get
old
.
Au
revoir
,
*NL*
Benedetto
;
''
and
running
into
a
court
,
he
disappeared
.
``
Alas
,
''
said
*NL*
Andrea
,
sighing
,
``
one
can
not
be
completely
happy
in
this
world
!

Chapter
65
.
A
Conjugal
Scene
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
Place
Louis
XV
.
the
three
young
people
separated
--
that
is
to
*NL*
say
,
Morrel
went
to
the
Boulevards
,
Chateau-Renaud
to
the
Pont
de
*NL*
la
Revolution
,
and
Debray
to
the
Quai
.
Most
probably
Morrel
and
*NL*
Chateau-Renaud
returned
to
their
``
domestic
hearths
,
''
as
they
say
in
the
*NL*
gallery
of
the
Chamber
in
well-turned
speeches
,
and
in
the
theatre
of
*NL*
the
Rue
Richelieu
in
well-written
pieces
;
but
it
was
not
the
case
with
*NL*
Debray
.
When
he
reached
the
wicket
of
the
Louvre
,
he
turned
to
the
left
,
*NL*
galloped
across
the
Carrousel
,
passed
through
the
Rue
Saint-Roch
,
and
,
*NL*
issuing
from
the
Rue
de
la
Michodiere
,
he
arrived
at
M.
Danglars
'
door
*NL*
just
at
the
same
time
that
Villefort
's
landau
,
after
having
deposited
*NL*
him
and
his
wife
at
the
Faubourg
St.
Honore
,
stopped
to
leave
the
*NL*
baroness
at
her
own
house
.
Debray
,
with
the
air
of
a
man
familiar
with
*NL*
the
house
,
entered
first
into
the
court
,
threw
his
bridle
into
the
hands
*NL*
of
a
footman
,
and
returned
to
the
door
to
receive
Madame
Danglars
,
to
*NL*
whom
he
offered
his
arm
,
to
conduct
her
to
her
apartments
.
The
gate
once
*NL*
closed
,
and
Debray
and
the
baroness
alone
in
the
court
,
he
asked
,
--
``
What
*NL*
was
the
matter
with
you
,
Hermine
?
and
why
were
you
so
affected
at
that
*NL*
story
,
or
rather
fable
,
which
the
count
related
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
I
have
been
in
such
shocking
spirits
all
the
evening
,
my
*NL*
friend
,
''
said
the
baroness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Hermine
,
''
replied
Debray
;
``
you
can
not
make
me
believe
that
;
on
the
*NL*
contrary
,
you
were
in
excellent
spirits
when
you
arrived
at
the
count
's
.
*NL*
M.
Danglars
was
disagreeable
,
certainly
,
but
I
know
how
much
you
care
*NL*
for
his
ill-humor
.
Some
one
has
vexed
you
;
I
will
allow
no
one
to
annoy
*NL*
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
deceived
,
Lucien
,
I
assure
you
,
''
replied
Madame
Danglars
;
``
and
*NL*
what
I
have
told
you
is
really
the
case
,
added
to
the
ill-humor
you
*NL*
remarked
,
but
which
I
did
not
think
it
worth
while
to
allude
to
.
''
It
*NL*
was
evident
that
Madame
Danglars
was
suffering
from
that
nervous
*NL*
irritability
which
women
frequently
can
not
account
for
even
to
*NL*
themselves
;
or
that
,
as
Debray
had
guessed
,
she
had
experienced
some
*NL*
secret
agitation
that
she
would
not
acknowledge
to
any
one
.
Being
a
*NL*
man
who
knew
that
the
former
of
these
symptoms
was
one
of
the
inherent
*NL*
penalties
of
womanhood
,
he
did
not
then
press
his
inquiries
,
but
waited
*NL*
for
a
more
appropriate
opportunity
when
he
should
again
interrogate
*NL*
her
,
or
receive
an
avowal
proprio
motu
.
At
the
door
of
her
apartment
the
*NL*
baroness
met
Mademoiselle
Cornelie
,
her
confidential
maid
.
``
What
is
my
*NL*
daughter
doing
?
''
asked
Madame
Danglars
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
practiced
all
the
evening
,
and
then
went
to
bed
,
''
replied
*NL*
Mademoiselle
Cornelie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yet
I
think
I
hear
her
piano
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
Mademoiselle
Louise
d'Armilly
,
who
is
playing
while
Mademoiselle
*NL*
Danglars
is
in
bed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Madame
Danglars
,
``
come
and
undress
me
.
''
They
entered
*NL*
the
bedroom
.
Debray
stretched
himself
upon
a
large
couch
,
and
Madame
*NL*
Danglars
passed
into
her
dressing-room
with
Mademoiselle
Cornelie
.
``
My
*NL*
dear
M.
Lucien
,
''
said
Madame
Danglars
through
the
door
,
``
you
are
always
*NL*
complaining
that
Eugenie
will
not
address
a
word
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madame
,
''
said
Lucien
,
playing
with
a
little
dog
,
who
,
recognizing
him
*NL*
as
a
friend
of
the
house
,
expected
to
be
caressed
,
``
I
am
not
the
only
*NL*
one
who
makes
similar
complaints
,
I
think
I
heard
Morcerf
say
that
he
*NL*
could
not
extract
a
word
from
his
betrothed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
True
,
''
said
Madame
Danglars
;
``
yet
I
think
this
will
all
pass
off
,
and
*NL*
that
you
will
one
day
see
her
enter
your
study
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
study
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
least
that
of
the
minister
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
so
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
ask
for
an
engagement
at
the
Opera
.
Really
,
I
never
saw
such
an
*NL*
infatuation
for
music
;
it
is
quite
ridiculous
for
a
young
lady
of
*NL*
fashion
.
''
Debray
smiled
.
``
Well
,
''
said
he
,
``
let
her
come
,
with
your
*NL*
consent
and
that
of
the
baron
,
and
we
will
try
and
give
her
an
*NL*
engagement
,
though
we
are
very
poor
to
pay
such
talent
as
hers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
,
Cornelie
,
''
said
Madame
Danglars
,
``
I
do
not
require
you
any
longer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Cornelie
obeyed
,
and
the
next
minute
Madame
Danglars
left
her
room
in
*NL*
a
charming
loose
dress
,
and
came
and
sat
down
close
to
Debray
.
Then
she
*NL*
began
thoughtfully
to
caress
the
little
spaniel
.
Lucien
looked
at
her
*NL*
for
a
moment
in
silence
.
``
Come
,
Hermine
,
''
he
said
,
after
a
short
time
,
*NL*
``
answer
candidly
,
--
something
vexes
you
--
is
it
not
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
,
''
answered
the
baroness
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
yet
,
as
she
could
scarcely
breathe
,
she
rose
and
went
towards
*NL*
a
looking-glass
.
``
I
am
frightful
to-night
,
''
she
said
.
Debray
rose
,
*NL*
smiling
,
and
was
about
to
contradict
the
baroness
upon
this
latter
*NL*
point
,
when
the
door
opened
suddenly
.
M.
Danglars
appeared
;
Debray
*NL*
reseated
himself
.
At
the
noise
of
the
door
Madame
Danglars
turned
round
,
*NL*
and
looked
upon
her
husband
with
an
astonishment
she
took
no
trouble
*NL*
to
conceal
.
``
Good-evening
,
madame
,
''
said
the
banker
;
``
good-evening
,
M.
*NL*
Debray
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Probably
the
baroness
thought
this
unexpected
visit
signified
a
desire
*NL*
to
make
up
for
the
sharp
words
he
had
uttered
during
the
day
.
Assuming
*NL*
a
dignified
air
,
she
turned
round
to
Debray
,
without
answering
her
*NL*
husband
.
``
Read
me
something
,
M.
Debray
,
''
she
said
.
Debray
,
who
was
*NL*
slightly
disturbed
at
this
visit
,
recovered
himself
when
he
saw
the
*NL*
calmness
of
the
baroness
,
and
took
up
a
book
marked
by
a
mother-of-pearl
*NL*
knife
inlaid
with
gold
.
``
Excuse
me
,
''
said
the
banker
,
``
but
you
will
*NL*
tire
yourself
,
baroness
,
by
such
late
hours
,
and
M.
Debray
lives
some
*NL*
distance
from
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Debray
was
petrified
,
not
only
to
hear
Danglars
speak
so
calmly
and
*NL*
politely
,
but
because
it
was
apparent
that
beneath
outward
politeness
*NL*
there
really
lurked
a
determined
spirit
of
opposition
to
anything
his
*NL*
wife
might
wish
to
do
.
The
baroness
was
also
surprised
,
and
showed
her
*NL*
astonishment
by
a
look
which
would
doubtless
have
had
some
effect
upon
*NL*
her
husband
if
he
had
not
been
intently
occupied
with
the
paper
,
where
*NL*
he
was
looking
to
see
the
closing
stock
quotations
.
The
result
was
,
that
*NL*
the
proud
look
entirely
failed
of
its
purpose
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
M.
Lucien
,
''
said
the
baroness
,
``
I
assure
you
I
have
no
desire
to
sleep
,
*NL*
and
that
I
have
a
thousand
things
to
tell
you
this
evening
,
which
you
*NL*
must
listen
to
,
even
though
you
slept
while
hearing
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
at
your
service
,
madame
,
''
replied
Lucien
coldly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
M.
Debray
,
''
said
the
banker
,
``
do
not
kill
yourself
to-night
*NL*
listening
to
the
follies
of
Madame
Danglars
,
for
you
can
hear
them
as
*NL*
well
to-morrow
;
but
I
claim
to-night
and
will
devote
it
,
if
you
will
*NL*
allow
me
,
to
talk
over
some
serious
matters
with
my
wife
.
''
This
time
*NL*
the
blow
was
so
well
aimed
,
and
hit
so
directly
,
that
Lucien
and
the
*NL*
baroness
were
staggered
,
and
they
interrogated
each
other
with
their
*NL*
eyes
,
as
if
to
seek
help
against
this
aggression
,
but
the
irresistible
*NL*
will
of
the
master
of
the
house
prevailed
,
and
the
husband
was
*NL*
victorious
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
not
think
I
wish
to
turn
you
out
,
my
dear
Debray
,
''
continued
*NL*
Danglars
;
``
oh
,
no
,
not
at
all
.
An
unexpected
occurrence
forces
me
to
ask
*NL*
my
wife
to
have
a
little
conversation
with
me
;
it
is
so
rarely
I
make
*NL*
such
a
request
,
I
am
sure
you
can
not
grudge
it
to
me
.
''
Debray
muttered
*NL*
something
,
bowed
and
went
out
,
knocking
himself
against
the
edge
of
the
*NL*
door
,
like
Nathan
in
``
Athalie
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
extraordinary
,
''
he
said
,
when
the
door
was
closed
behind
him
,
*NL*
``
how
easily
these
husbands
,
whom
we
ridicule
,
gain
an
advantage
over
*NL*
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lucien
having
left
,
Danglars
took
his
place
on
the
sofa
,
closed
the
open
*NL*
book
,
and
placing
himself
in
a
dreadfully
dictatorial
attitude
,
he
began
*NL*
playing
with
the
dog
;
but
the
animal
,
not
liking
him
as
well
as
Debray
,
*NL*
and
attempting
to
bite
him
,
Danglars
seized
him
by
the
skin
of
his
neck
*NL*
and
threw
him
upon
a
couch
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
.
The
animal
*NL*
uttered
a
cry
during
the
transit
,
but
,
arrived
at
its
destination
,
it
*NL*
crouched
behind
the
cushions
,
and
stupefied
at
such
unusual
treatment
*NL*
remained
silent
and
motionless
.
``
Do
you
know
,
sir
,
''
asked
the
baroness
,
*NL*
``
that
you
are
improving
?
Generally
you
are
only
rude
,
but
to-night
you
*NL*
are
brutal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
because
I
am
in
a
worse
humor
than
usual
,
''
replied
Danglars
.
*NL*
Hermine
looked
at
the
banker
with
supreme
disdain
.
These
glances
*NL*
frequently
exasperated
the
pride
of
Danglars
,
but
this
evening
he
took
*NL*
no
notice
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
have
I
to
do
with
your
ill-humor
?
''
said
the
baroness
,
*NL*
irritated
at
the
impassibility
of
her
husband
;
``
do
these
things
concern
*NL*
me
?
Keep
your
ill-humor
at
home
in
your
money
boxes
,
or
,
since
you
have
*NL*
clerks
whom
you
pay
,
vent
it
upon
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
so
,
''
replied
Danglars
;
``
your
advice
is
wrong

M.

*NL*
I
will
not

I
pay

them

I
shall
not
get
*NL*
into

with

those
with
whom
I
will
be
in
a
passion
are
*NL*
those
who
eat
my
dinners

mount
my
horses

exhaust
my
fortune

*NL*
*NL*
``
And

out
700,000

*NL*

Once

replied
the
baroness
sharply

``
I
tell
you
I

*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
``
Most

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
like
to
know
upon

occasion
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
mon
Dieu
,
that
is
very
easily
done
.
Last
February
you
were
the
*NL*
first
who
told
me
of
the
Haitian
funds
.
You
had
dreamed
that
a
ship
had
*NL*
entered
the
harbor
at
Havre
,
that
this
ship
brought
news
that
a
*NL*
payment
we
had
looked
upon
as
lost
was
going
to
be
made
.
I
know
how
*NL*
clear-sighted
your
dreams
are
;
I
therefore
purchased
immediately
as
many
*NL*
shares
as
I
could
of
the
Haitian
debt
,
and
I
gained
400,000
francs
by
*NL*
it
,
of
which
100,000
have
been
honestly
paid
to
you
.
You
spent
it
as
you
*NL*
pleased
;
that
was
your
business
.
In
March
there
was
a
question
about
a
*NL*
grant
to
a
railway
.
Three
companies
presented
themselves
,
each
offering
*NL*
equal
securities
.
You
told
me
that
your
instinct
,
--
and
although
you
*NL*
pretend
to
know
nothing
about
speculations
,
I
think
on
the
contrary
,
*NL*
that
your
comprehension
is
very
clear
upon
certain
affairs
,
--
well
,
you
*NL*
told
me
that
your
instinct
led
you
to
believe
the
grant
would
be
given
*NL*
to
the
company
called
the
Southern
.
I
bought
two
thirds
of
the
shares
*NL*
of
that
company
;
as
you
had
foreseen
,
the
shares
trebled
in
value
,
and
*NL*
I
picked
up
a
million
,
from
which
250,000
francs
were
paid
to
you
for
*NL*
pin-money
.
How
have
you
spent
this
250,000
francs
?
--
it
is
no
business
of
*NL*
mine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
are
you
coming
to
the
point
?
''
cried
the
baroness
,
shivering
with
*NL*
anger
and
impatience
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Patience

madame

I
am
coming

it

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
fortunate

*NL*
*NL*
``
In
April
you
went
to
dine
at
the
minister
's
.
You
heard
a
private
*NL*
conversation
respecting
Spanish
affairs
--
on
the
expulsion
of
Don
Carlos
.
*NL*
I
bought
some
Spanish
shares
.
The
expulsion
took
place
and
I
pocketed
*NL*
600,000
francs
the
day
Charles
V.
repassed
the
Bidassoa
.
Of
these
*NL*
600,000
francs
you
took
50,000
crowns
.
They
were
yours
,
you
disposed
of
*NL*
them
according
to
your
fancy
,
and
I
asked
no
questions
;
but
it
is
not
*NL*
the
less
true
that
you
have
this
year
received
500,000
livres

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
sir
,
and
what
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
yes

it
was
just
after
this
that
you
spoiled
everything

*NL*
*NL*

Really

your
manner

*NL*

It
expresses

all
I

Well

three
days
after

that
you
talked
politics
with
M.
Debray
,
and
you
fancied
from
his
words
*NL*
that
Don
Carlos
had
returned
to
Spain
.
Well
,
I
sold
my
shares
,
the
news
*NL*
got
out
,
and
I
no

sold

I
gave
them
away

next
day
I
find
the
*NL*
news
was
false

by

false

I
have
lost
700,000

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

*NL*

Well

I
gave
you
a

I
think
you
owe
me
a

fourth
of
my
losses

the
fourth
of
700,000

is
175,000

What
you

absurd

up
in
this
affair

*NL*
*NL*
``
Because

not
possess

175,000

to

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For

exclaimed
the
baroness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

us
have
no

to
tell

500,000

a

where

without

and
is
no

when

''
The
baroness
became
enraged
.
*NL*
``
Wretch
!
''
she
cried
,
``
will
you
dare
to
tell
me
you
did
not
know
what
you
*NL*
now
reproach
me
with
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

not

I

I
merely
tell
you
to
look
into
my
conduct
during
the
last
four
years
*NL*
that
we
have
ceased
to
be
husband
and
wife
,
and
see
whether
it
has
not
*NL*
always
been
consistent
.
Some
time
after
our
rupture
,
you
wished
to
*NL*
study
music
,
under
the
celebrated
baritone
who
made
such
a
successful
*NL*
appearance
at
the
Theatre
Italien
;
at
the
same
time
I
felt
inclined
to
*NL*
learn
dancing
of
the
danseuse
who
acquired
such
a
reputation
in
London
.
*NL*
This
cost
me
,
on
your
account
and
mine
,
100,000
francs
.
I
said
nothing
,
*NL*
for
we
must
have
peace
in
the
house
;
and
100,000
francs
for
a
lady
and
*NL*
gentleman
to
be
properly
instructed
in
music
and
dancing
are
not
too
*NL*
much
.
Well
,
you
soon
become
tired
of
singing
,
and
you
take
a
fancy
*NL*
to
study
diplomacy
with
the
minister
's
secretary
.
You
understand
,
it
*NL*
signifies
nothing
to
me
so
long
as
you
pay
for
your
lessons
out
of
your
*NL*
own
cashbox
.
But
to-day
I
find
you
are
drawing
on
mine
,
and
that
your
*NL*
apprenticeship
may
cost
me
700,000
francs
per
month
.
Stop
there
,
madame
,
*NL*
for
this
can
not
last
.
Either
the
diplomatist
must
give
his
lessons
*NL*
gratis
,
and
I
will
tolerate
him
,
or
he
must
never
set
his
foot
again
in
*NL*
my
house
;

do
you
understand
,
madame
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

Hermine

first

neither

philosopher

a

perhaps
being
both

and
seeing
there
was
*NL*
nothing
to
be
got
out
of
a
king

attorney
,
died
of
grief

anger
at
*NL*
finding
,
after
an
absence
of
nine
months
,
that
you
had
been
enceinte
*NL*
six
.
I
am
brutal
,
--
I
not
only
allow
it
,
but
boast
of
it
;
it
is
one
*NL*
of
the
reasons
of
my
success
in
commercial
business
.
Why
did
he
kill
*NL*
himself
instead
of
you
?
Because
he
had
no
cash
to
save
.
My
life
belongs
*NL*
to
my
cash
.
M.
Debray
has
made
me
lose
700,000
francs
;
let
him
bear
his
*NL*
share
of
the
loss
,
and
we
will
go
on
as
before
;
if
not
,
let
him
become
*NL*
bankrupt
for
the
250,000
livres
,
and
do
as
all
bankrupts
do
--
disappear
.
*NL*
He
is
a
charming
fellow
,
I
allow
,
when
his
news
is
correct
;
but
when
*NL*
it
is
not
,
there
are
fifty
others
in

who
would
do
better
than
*NL*
he

*NL*
Madame
Danglars
was
rooted
to
the
spot
;
she
made
a
violent
effort
*NL*
to
reply
to
this
last
attack
,
but
she
fell
upon
a
chair
thinking
of
*NL*
Villefort
,
of
the
dinner
scene
,
of
the
strange
series
of
misfortunes
*NL*
which
had
taken
place
in
her
house
during
the
last
few
days
,
and
changed
*NL*
the
usual
calm
of
her
establishment
to
a
scene
of
scandalous
debate
.
*NL*
Danglars
did
not
even
look
at
her
,
though
she
did
her
best
to
faint
.
*NL*
He
shut
the
bedroom
door
after
him
,
without
adding
another
word
,
and
*NL*
returned
to
his
apartments
;
and
when
Madame
Danglars
recovered
from
her
*NL*
half-fainting
condition
,
she
could
almost
believe
that
she
had
had
a
*NL*
disagreeable
dream
.

*NL*
*NL*
The
day
following
this
scene
,
at
the
hour
the
banker
usually
chose
to
*NL*
pay
a
visit
to
Madame
Danglars
on
his
way
to
his
office
,
his
coupe
*NL*
did
not
appear
.
At
this
time
,
that
is
,
about
half-past
twelve
,
Madame
*NL*
Danglars
ordered
her
carriage
,
and
went
out
.
Danglars
,
hidden
behind
a
*NL*
curtain
,
watched
the
departure
he
had
been
waiting
for
.
He
gave
orders
*NL*
that
he
should
be
informed
as
soon
as
Madame
Danglars
appeared
;
but
at
*NL*
two
o'clock
she
had
not
returned
.
He
then
called
for
his
horses
,
drove
*NL*
to
the
Chamber
,
and
inscribed
his
name
to
speak
against
the
budget
.
From
*NL*
twelve
to
two
o'clock
Danglars
had
remained
in
his
study
,
unsealing
his
*NL*
dispatches
,
and
becoming
more
and
more
sad
every
minute
,
heaping
*NL*
figure
upon
figure
,
and
receiving
,
among
other
visits
,
one
from
Major
*NL*
Cavalcanti
,
who
,
as
stiff
and
exact
as
ever
,
presented
himself
precisely
*NL*
at
the
hour
named
the
night
before
,
to
terminate
his
business
with
the
*NL*
banker
.
On
leaving
the
Chamber
,
Danglars
,
who
had
shown
violent
marks
of
*NL*
agitation
during
the
sitting
,
and
been
more
bitter
than
ever
against
the
*NL*
ministry
,
re-entered
his
carriage
,
and
told
the
coachman
to
drive
to
the
*NL*
Avenue
des
Champs-Elysees
,
No.

.
*NL*
*NL*
Monte
Cristo
was
at
home
;
only
he
was
engaged
with
some
one
and
begged
*NL*
Danglars
to
wait
for
a
moment
in
the
drawing-room
.
While
the
banker
was
*NL*
waiting
in
the
anteroom
,
the
door
opened
,
and
a
man
dressed
as
an
abbe
*NL*
and
doubtless
more
familiar
with
the
house
than
he
was
,
came
in
and
*NL*
instead
of
waiting
,
merely
bowed
,
passed
on
to
the
farther
apartments
,
*NL*
and
disappeared
.
A
minute
after
the
door
by
which
the
priest
had
entered
*NL*
reopened
,
and
Monte
Cristo
appeared
.
``
Pardon
me
,
''
said
he
,
``
my
dear
*NL*
baron
,
but
one
of
my
friends
,
the
Abbe
Busoni
,
whom
you
perhaps
saw
pass
*NL*
by
,
has
just
arrived
in
Paris
;
not
having
seen
him
for
a
long
time
,
I
*NL*
could
not
make
up
my
mind
to
leave
him
sooner
,
so
I
hope
this
will
be
*NL*
sufficient
reason
for
my
having
made
you
wait
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay

''
said
Danglars
,
``
it
is
my
fault

I
have
chosen
my
visit
at
a
wrong

time

will
retire

*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all

contrary

but
what
is
the
matter

with
you

You
look
careworn
;
really
,
you
alarm
me

Melancholy
in
a
*NL*
capitalist
,
like
the
appearance
of
a
comet

presages
some
misfortune
to
*NL*
the
world

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
been
in
ill-luck

bad

Ah

said
Monte

``
Have
you
had
another
fall
at

*NL*
Bourse

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
I
am
safe
for
a
few
days
at

I
am
only
annoyed
about
a
*NL*
bankrupt
of
Trieste

*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
?
Does
it
happen
to
be
Jacopo
Manfredi

*NL*
*NL*
``
Exactly
so

Imagine
a

transacted

do
n't

how
long
,
to
the
amount
of
800,000

900,000

during

the
year

Never
a
mistake

a
fellow
who
paid
like

was
a
million
in

with
him

It
is

I
draw
upon

present

This
,
with
my
*NL*
Spanish
affairs
,
made
a
pretty
end
to
the
month
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
really
lost
by
that
affair
in
Spain

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

only
700,000
francs
out
of
my
cash-box

nothing
more

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

how
could
you
make
such

such
an
old
stager

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it
is
all
my
wife
's
fault
.
She
dreamed
Don
Carlos
had
returned
to
*NL*
Spain
;
she
believes
in
dreams
.
It
is
magnetism
,
she
says
,
and
when
she
*NL*
dreams
a
thing
it
is
sure
to
happen
,
she
assures
me
.
On
this
conviction
*NL*
I
allow
her
to
speculate
,
she
having
her
bank
and
her
stockbroker
;
she
*NL*
speculated
and
lost
.
It
is
true
she
speculates
with
her
own
money
,
not
*NL*
mine
;
nevertheless
,
you
can
understand
that
when
700,000
francs
leave
*NL*
the
wife
's
pocket
,
the
husband
always
finds
it
out
.
But
do
you
mean
to
*NL*
say
you
have
not
heard
of
this
?
Why
,
the
thing
has
made
a
tremendous
*NL*
noise
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
heard
it
spoken
of
,
but
I
did
not
know
the
details
,
and
then
no
*NL*
one
can
be
more
ignorant
than
I
am
of
the
affairs
in
the
Bourse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
do
not
speculate
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
?

How
could
I
speculate
when
I
already
have
so
much
trouble
in
*NL*
regulating
my
income
?
I
should
be
obliged
,
besides
my
steward
,
to
keep
*NL*
a
clerk
and
a
boy
.
But
touching
these
Spanish
affairs
,
I
think
that
the
*NL*
baroness
did
not
dream
the
whole
of
the
Don
Carlos
matter
.
The
papers
*NL*
said
something
about
it
,
did
they
not
?

*NL*
``
Then
you
believe
the
papers

*NL*
``
I
?

not
the
least
in
the
world
;
only
I
fancied
that
the
honest
Messager
*NL*
was
an
exception
to
the
rule
,
and
that
it
only
announced
telegraphic
*NL*
despatches

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

that
's
what
puzzles
me

replied
Danglars

``
the
news
of
the
*NL*
return
of
Don
Carlos
was
brought
by
telegraph

``
So
that
,
''
said
Monte
Cristo
,
``
you
have
lost
nearly
1,700,000
francs

this
month

``
Not
nearly

indeed

that

``
Third-rate

Danglars

rather
humble

``

do
you
mean
by
that
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly

continued
Monte

,
``
I
make
three
assortments
in
*NL*
fortune
--
first-rate
,
second-rate
,
and
third-rate
fortunes
.
I
call
those
*NL*
first-rate
which
are
composed
of
treasures
one
possesses
under
one
's
*NL*
hand
,
such
as
mines
,
lands
,
and
funded
property
,
in
such
states
as
*NL*
France

Austria
,
and
England
,
provided
these
treasures
and
property
form
*NL*
a
total
of
about
a
hundred
millions

I
call
those
second-rate
fortunes
,
*NL*
that
are
gained
by
manufacturing
enterprises
,
joint-stock
companies
,
*NL*
viceroyalties
,
and
principalities
,
not
drawing
more
than
1,500,000
*NL*
francs
,
the
whole
forming
a
capital
of
about
fifty
millions
;
finally
,
*NL*
I
call
those
third-rate
fortunes
,
which
are
composed
of
a
fluctuating
*NL*
capital
,
dependent
upon
the
will
of
others

or
upon
chances
which
*NL*
a
bankruptcy
involves

a
false
telegram
shakes

such
as
banks

speculations

the
day

in
fact

all
operations

the
influence
of
*NL*
greater
or
less
mischances
,
the
whole
bringing
in
a
real
or
fictitious
*NL*
capital

about
fifteen
millions

I
think
this
is
about
your
position

*NL*
is
it
not
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Confound
it
,
yes

replied
Danglars
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
result
,
then

of
six
more
such
months

this
would
be
to
reduce
*NL*
the
third-rate
house
to
despair

``
Oh

Danglars

very
pale

No

you
have
not
;
--
well

are
right

indulged

skin

We
have
our
clothes

some
more
splendid
than

credit

when

dies
he
has
only
his
skin

retiring

you
have
nothing

your
real
principal
of
*NL*
about
five
or
six
millions

most

never
more
than
a
fourth

size

magnified

out
of
the
five

six
millions
which
form
your

real
capital

you
have
just
lost
nearly
two
millions

which
must
,
of

course

in

degree
diminish
your
credit

fictitious
fortune

to
follow
out
my

your
skin
has
been
opened
by
bleeding

this
*NL*
if
repeated
three

four
times
will
cause
death

so
pay
attention
to
*NL*
it

some

assistance
all
his
philosophy

dissimulation

``
No

Danglars

with

the

sounding
his

It
is
usual

certainly
;

Cavalcanti
is
an
original
who
does
nothing

can
not
help
thinking

has
brought
his

to

choose
a

what
is
your

it
is
that

My

that
all
these

podestas

these
ancient
*NL*
condottieri

for
the
Cavalcanti
have
commanded
armies

governed

my
opinion

I
say

is
,
that
they
have
buried
their
millions
*NL*
in
corners
,
the
secret
of
which
they
have
transmitted
only
to
their
*NL*
eldest
sons

have
done
the

from
generation
to

*NL*
the
proof

this
is
seen
in
their
yellow
and
dry
appearance

like
the
*NL*
florins
of
the
republic
,
which
,
from
being
constantly
gazed
upon

have
*NL*
become
reflected
in
them

*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
,
''
said
Danglars

this
is
further
supported
by
the
fact

of
their
not
possessing
an
inch
of
land

*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
little
,
at

I
know

none

his

*NL*
*NL*

Ah

Danglars

*NL*

Yes

more
than

it

through

lie
dormant

in

multiplying
his

remember

that

this
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Never

It

a

fine

inscribe
on

ledgers
,
and
my
cashier
was
quite
proud
of
*NL*
it
when
I
explained
to
him
who
the
Cavalcanti
were
.
By
the
way
,
this
is
*NL*
merely
a
simple
question
,
when
this
sort
of
people
marry
their
sons
,
do
*NL*
they
give
them
any
fortune
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

that
depends

an
Italian
prince

rich
as

a
gold
mine

one
of
the
noblest
families
in
Tuscany

who
,
when
his

gave

millions

allowed

thirty

his
father

views

he
will
,
perhaps
,
give
him
*NL*
one
,
two

three
millions

For
example
,
supposing
it
were
the
daughter
*NL*
of
a
banker
,
he
might
take
an
interest
in
the
house
of
the
father-in-law

of
his
son

then
again

the
major

the

key

be

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

Chapter
67
.
At
the
Office
of
the
King
's
Attorney
.
*NL*
*NL*
Let
us
leave
the
banker
driving
his
horses
at
their
fullest
speed
,
and
*NL*
follow
Madame
Danglars
in
her
morning
excursion
.
We
have
said
that
at
*NL*
half-past
twelve
o'clock
Madame
Danglars
had
ordered
her
horses
,
and
had
*NL*
left
home
in
the
carriage
.
She
directed
her
course
towards
the
Faubourg
*NL*
Saint
Germain
,
went
down
the
Rue
Mazarine
,
and
stopped
at
the
Passage
*NL*
du
Pont-Neuf
.
She
descended
,
and
went
through
the
passage
.
She
was
very
*NL*
plainly
dressed
,
as
would
be
the
case
with
a
woman
of
taste
walking
in
*NL*
the
morning
.
At
the
Rue
Guenegaud
she
called
a
cab
,
and
directed
the
*NL*
driver
to
go
to
the
Rue
de
Harlay
.
As
soon
as
she
was
seated
in
the
*NL*
vehicle
,
she
drew
from
her
pocket
a
very
thick
black
veil
,
which
she
*NL*
tied
on
to
her
straw
bonnet
.
She
then
replaced
the
bonnet
,
and
saw
*NL*
with
pleasure
,
in
a
little
pocket-mirror
,
that
her
white
complexion
and
*NL*
brilliant
eyes
were
alone
visible
.
The
cab
crossed
the
Pont-Neuf
and
*NL*
entered
the
Rue
de
Harlay
by
the
Place
Dauphine
;
the
driver
was
paid
as
*NL*
the
door
opened
,
and
stepping
lightly
up
the
stairs
Madame
Danglars
soon
*NL*
reached
the
Salle
des
Pas-Perdus
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
great
deal
going
on
that
morning
,
and
many
business-like
*NL*
persons
at
the
Palais
;
business-like
persons
pay
very
little
attention
*NL*
to
women
,
and
Madame
Danglars
crossed
the
hall
without
exciting
any
*NL*
more
attention
than
any
other
woman
calling
upon
her
lawyer
.
There
was
*NL*
a
great
press
of
people
in
M.
de
Villefort
's
ante-chamber
,
but
Madame
*NL*
Danglars
had
no
occasion
even
to
pronounce
her
name
.
The
instant
she
*NL*
appeared
the
door-keeper
rose
,
came
to
her
,
and
asked
her
whether
she
*NL*
was
not
the
person
with
whom
the
procureur
had
made
an
appointment
;
and
*NL*
on
her
affirmative
answer
being
given
,
he
conducted
her
by
a
private
*NL*
passage
to
M.
de
Villefort
's
office
.
The
magistrate
was
seated
in
an
*NL*
arm-chair
,
writing
,
with
his
back
towards
the
door
;
he
did
not
move
as
*NL*
he
heard
it
open
,
and
the
door-keeper
pronounce
the
words
,
``
Walk
in
,
*NL*
madame
,
''
and
then
reclose
it
;
but
no
sooner
had
the
man
's
footsteps
*NL*
ceased
,
than
he
started
up
,
drew
the
bolts
,
closed
the
curtains
,
and
*NL*
examined
every
corner
of
the
room
.
Then
,
when
he
had
assured
himself
*NL*
that
he
could
neither
be
seen
nor
heard
,
and
was
consequently
relieved
*NL*
of
doubts
,
he
said
,
--
``
Thanks
,
madame
,
--
thanks
for
your
punctuality
;
''
and
*NL*
he
offered
a
chair
to
Madame
Danglars
,
which
she
accepted
,
for
her
heart
*NL*
beat
so
violently
that
she
felt
nearly
suffocated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
long
time
,
madame
,
''
said
the
procureur
,
describing
a
*NL*
half-circle
with
his
chair
,
so
as
to
place
himself
exactly
opposite
*NL*
to
Madame
Danglars
,
--
``
it
is
a
long
time
since
I
had
the
pleasure
of
*NL*
speaking
alone
with
you
,
and
I
regret
that
we
have
only
now
met
to
enter
*NL*
upon
a
painful
conversation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nevertheless
,
sir
,
you
see
I
have
answered
your
first
appeal
,
although
*NL*
certainly
the
conversation
must
be
much
more
painful
for
me
than
for
*NL*
you
.
''
Villefort
smiled
bitterly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
true
,
then
,
''
he
said
,
rather
uttering
his
thoughts
aloud
than
*NL*
addressing
his
companion
,
--
``
it
is
true
,
then
,
that
all
our
actions
leave
*NL*
their
traces
--
some
sad
,
others
bright
--
on
our
paths
;
it
is
true
*NL*
that
every
step
in
our
lives
is
like
the
course
of
an
insect
on
the
*NL*
sands
;
--
it
leaves
its
track
!
Alas
,
to
many
the
path
is
traced
by
tears
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
,
''
said
Madame
Danglars
,
``
you
can
feel
for
my
emotion
,
can
you
not
?
*NL*
Spare
me
,
then
,
I
beseech
you
.
When
I
look
at
this
room
,
--
whence
so
many
*NL*
guilty
creatures
have
departed
,
trembling
and
ashamed
,
when
I
look
*NL*
at
that
chair
before
which
I
now
sit
trembling
and
ashamed
,
--
oh
,
it
*NL*
requires
all
my
reason
to
convince
me
that
I
am
not
a
very
guilty
woman
*NL*
and
you
a
menacing
judge
.
''
Villefort
dropped
his
head
and
sighed
.
``
And
*NL*
I
,
''
he
said
,
``
I
feel
that
my
place
is
not
in
the
judge
's
seat
,
but
on
*NL*
the
prisoner
's
stool
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
?
''
said
Madame
Danglars
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
,
sir
,
you
exaggerate
your
situation
,
''
said
Madame
Danglars
,
*NL*
whose
beautiful
eyes
sparkled
for
a
moment
.
``
The
paths
of
which
you
were
*NL*
just
speaking
have
been
traced
by
all
young
men
of
ardent
imaginations
.
*NL*
Besides
the
pleasure
,
there
is
always
remorse
from
the
indulgence
of
our
*NL*
passions
,
and
,
after
all
,
what
have
you
men
to
fear
from
all
this
?
the
*NL*
world
excuses
,
and
notoriety
ennobles
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madame
,
''
replied
Villefort
,
``
you
know
that
I
am
no
hypocrite
,
or
,
at
*NL*
least
,
that
I
never
deceive
without
a
reason
.
If
my
brow
be
severe
,
it
*NL*
is
because
many
misfortunes
have
clouded
it
;
if
my
heart
be
petrified
,
*NL*
it
is
that
it
might
sustain
the
blows
it
has
received
.
I
was
not
so
in
*NL*
my
youth
,
I
was
not
so
on
the
night
of
the
betrothal
,
when
we
were
all
*NL*
seated
around
a
table
in
the
Rue
du
Cours
at
Marseilles
.
But
since
*NL*
then
everything
has
changed
in
and
about
me
;
I
am
accustomed
to
brave
*NL*
difficulties
,
and
,
in
the
conflict
to
crush
those
who
,
by
their
own
free
*NL*
will
,
or
by
chance
,
voluntarily
or
involuntarily
,
interfere
with
me
in
*NL*
my
career
.
It
is
generally
the
case
that
what
we
most
ardently
desire
*NL*
is
as
ardently
withheld
from
us
by
those
who
wish
to
obtain
it
,
or
from
*NL*
whom
we
attempt
to
snatch
it
.
Thus
,
the
greater
number
of
a
man
's
errors
*NL*
come
before
him
disguised
under
the
specious
form
of
necessity
;
then
,
*NL*
after
error
has
been
committed
in
a
moment
of
excitement
,
of
delirium
,
*NL*
or
of
fear
,
we
see
that
we
might
have
avoided
and
escaped
it
.
The
means
*NL*
we
might
have
used
,
which
we
in
our
blindness
could
not
see
,
then
seem
*NL*
simple
and
easy
,
and
we
say
,
`
Why
did
I
not
do
this
,
instead
of
that
?
'
*NL*
Women
,
on
the
contrary
,
are
rarely
tormented
with
remorse
;
for
the
*NL*
decision
does
not
come
from
you
,
--
your
misfortunes
are
generally
imposed
*NL*
upon
you
,
and
your
faults
the
results
of
others
'
crimes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
any
case
,
sir
,
you
will
allow
,
''
replied
Madame
Danglars
,
``
that
,
even
*NL*
if
the
fault
were
alone
mine
,
I
last
night
received
a
severe
punishment
*NL*
for
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
thing
,
''
said
Villefort
,
pressing
her
hand
,
``
it
was
too
severe
for
*NL*
your
strength
,
for
you
were
twice
overwhelmed
,
and
yet
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

I
must
tell
you

you

all

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

exclaimed
Madame
Danglars
,
alarmed
,
``
what
is
there
more
to
hear
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
only
look
back
to
the
past

it
is

indeed

bad
enough

Well
,
*NL*
picture
to
yourself
a
future
more
gloomy
still
--
certainly
frightful
,
*NL*
perhaps
sanguinary
.
''
The
baroness
knew
how
calm
Villefort
naturally
was
,
*NL*
and
his
present
excitement
frightened
her
so
much
that
she
opened
*NL*
her
mouth
to
scream
,
but
the
sound
died
in
her
throat
.
``
How
has
this
*NL*
terrible
past
been
recalled
?
''
cried
Villefort
;
``
how
is
it
that
it
has
*NL*
escaped
from
the
depths
of
the
tomb
and
the
recesses
of
our
hearts
,
*NL*
where
it
was
buried
,
to
visit
us
now
,
like
a
phantom
,
whitening
our
*NL*
cheeks
and
flushing
our
brows
with
shame
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas
,
''
said
Hermine
,
``
doubtless
it
is
chance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Chance
?
''
replied
Villefort
;
``
No

no
,
madame
,
there
is
no
such
thing
as
*NL*
chance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
;
has
not
a
fatal
chance
revealed
all
this
?
Was
it
not
by
chance
*NL*
the
Count
of
Monte
Cristo
bought
that
house
?
Was
it
not
by
chance
he
*NL*
caused
the
earth
to
be
dug
up
?
Is
it
not
by
chance
that
the
unfortunate
*NL*
child
was
disinterred
under
the
trees
?
--
that
poor
innocent
offspring
of
*NL*
mine
,
which
I
never
even
kissed
,
but
for
whom
I
wept
many
,
many
tears
.
*NL*
Ah
,
my
heart
clung
to
the
count
when
he
mentioned
the
dear
spoil
found
*NL*
beneath
the
flowers

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
no
,
madame
,

this
is
the
terrible
news
I
have
to
tell
you

said
*NL*
Villefort
in
a
hollow
voice
--
``
no

nothing

there
was
no

no

you
must
tremble

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
can
you
mean

asked
Madame
Danglars
,
shuddering
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
mean
that
M.

because
neither

*NL*
*NL*
``
Neither

there

repeated
Madame
Danglars

her
staring

*NL*
wide-open
eyes
expressing
her
alarm

*NL*
*NL*
``
Neither

she
again
said
,
as
though
striving
to
impress

herself
with
the
meaning
of
the
words
which
escaped
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

said
Villefort

burying
his
face
in
his
hands
,
``
no

a
hundred
*NL*
times
no

*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
did
not
bury

*NL*
*NL*
``
There

But
listen

and
you
will
pity

who
has
for

twenty
years
alone
borne
the
heavy
burden

grief
I
am
about

reveal

without
casting
the

portion
upon

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

you
frighten

But
speak

I
will
listen

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
recollect
that
sad
night
,
when
you
were
half-expiring
on
that
*NL*
bed
in
the
red
damask
room
,
while
I
,
scarcely
less
agitated
than
you
,
*NL*
awaited
your
delivery
.
The
child
was
born
,
was
given
to
me
--
motionless
,
*NL*
breathless
,
voiceless
;
we
thought
it
dead
.
''
Madame
Danglars
moved
*NL*
rapidly
,
as
though
she
would
spring
from
her
chair
,
but
Villefort
*NL*
stopped
,
and
clasped
his
hands
as
if
to
implore
her
attention
.
``
We
*NL*
thought
it
dead
,
''
he
repeated
;
``
I
placed
it
in
the
chest
,
which
was
to
*NL*
take
the
place
of
a
coffin
;
I
descended
to
the
garden
,
I
dug
a
hole
,
and
*NL*
then
flung
it
down
in
haste
.
Scarcely
had
I
covered
it
with
earth
,
when
*NL*
the
arm
of
the
Corsican
was
stretched
towards
me
;
I
saw
a
shadow
rise
,
*NL*
and
,
at
the
same
time
,
a
flash
of
light
.
I
felt
pain
;
I
wished
to
cry
*NL*
out
,
but
an
icy
shiver
ran
through
my
veins
and
stifled
my
voice
;
I
fell
*NL*
lifeless
,
and
fancied
myself
killed
.
Never
shall
I
forget
your
sublime
*NL*
courage
,
when
,
having
returned
to
consciousness
,
I
dragged
myself
to
the
*NL*
foot
of
the
stairs
,
and
you
,
almost
dying
yourself
,
came
to
meet
me
.
We
*NL*
were
obliged
to
keep
silent
upon
the
dreadful
catastrophe
.
You
had
the
*NL*
fortitude
to
regain
the
house
,
assisted
by
your
nurse
.
A
duel
was
*NL*
the
pretext
for
my
wound
.
Though
we
scarcely
expected
it
,
our
secret
*NL*
remained
in
our
own
keeping
alone
.
I
was
taken
to
Versailles
;
for
three
*NL*
months
I
struggled
with
death
;
at
last
,
as
I
seemed
to
cling
to
life
,
*NL*
I
was
ordered
to
the
South
.
Four
men
carried
me
from
Paris
to
Chalons
,
*NL*
walking
six
leagues
a
day
;
Madame
de
Villefort
followed
the
litter
in
*NL*
her
carriage
.
At
Chalons
I
was
put
upon
the
Saone
,
thence
I
passed
on
*NL*
to
the
Rhone
,
whence
I
descended
,
merely
with
the
current
,
to
Arles
;
*NL*
at
Arles
I
was
again
placed
on
my
litter
,
and
continued
my
journey
to
*NL*
Marseilles
.
My
recovery
lasted
six
months
.
I
never
heard
you
mentioned
,
*NL*
and
I
did
not
dare
inquire
for
you
.
When
I
returned
to
Paris
,
I
learned
*NL*
that
you
,
the
widow
of
M.
de
Nargonne
,
had
married
M.
Danglars

What
was
the
subject
of
my
thoughts
from
the
time
consciousness
*NL*
returned
to
me
?
Always
the
same
--
always
the
child
's
corpse
,
coming
every
*NL*
night
in
my
dreams
,
rising
from
the
earth
,
and
hovering
over
the
grave
*NL*
with
menacing
look
and
gesture
.
I
inquired
immediately
on
my
return
to
*NL*
Paris
;
the
house
had
not
been
inhabited
since
we
left
it
,
but
it
had
*NL*
just
been
let
for
nine
years
.
I
found
the
tenant
.
I
pretended
that
I
*NL*
disliked
the
idea
that
a
house
belonging
to
my
wife
's
father
and
mother
*NL*
should
pass
into
the
hands
of
strangers
.
I
offered
to
pay
them
for
*NL*
cancelling
the
lease
;
they
demanded
6,000
francs
.
I
would
have
given
*NL*
10,000
--
I
would
have
given
20,000
.
I
had
the
money
with
me
;
I
made
the
*NL*
tenant
sign
the
deed
of
resilition
,
and
when
I
had
obtained
what
I
so
*NL*
much
wanted
,
I
galloped
to
Auteuil
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
one
had
entered
the
house
since
I
had
left
it
.
It
was
five
o'clock
*NL*
in
the
afternoon
;
I
ascended
into
the
red
room
,
and
waited
for
night
.
*NL*
There
all
the
thoughts
which
had
disturbed
me
during
my
year
of
constant
*NL*
agony
came
back
with
double
force
.
The
Corsican
,
who
had
declared
the
*NL*
vendetta
against
me
,
who
had
followed
me
from
Nimes
to
Paris
,
who
had
*NL*
hid
himself
in
the
garden
,
who
had
struck
me
,
had
seen
me
dig
the
grave
,
*NL*
had
seen
me
inter
the
child
,
--
he
might
become
acquainted
with
your
*NL*
person
,
--
nay
,
he
might
even
then
have
known
it
.
Would
he
not
one
day
*NL*
make
you
pay
for
keeping
this
terrible
secret
?
Would
it
not
be
a
sweet
*NL*
revenge
for
him
when
he
found
that
I
had
not
died
from
the
blow
of
his
*NL*
dagger
?
It
was
therefore
necessary
,
before
everything
else
,
and
at
all
*NL*
risks
,
that
I
should
cause
all
traces
of
the
past
to
disappear
--
that
*NL*
I
should
destroy
every
material
vestige
;
too
much
reality
would
always
*NL*
remain
in
my
recollection
.
It
was
for
this
I
had
annulled
the
lease
--
it
*NL*
was
for
this
I
had
come
--
it
was
for
this
I
was
waiting
.
Night
arrived
;
*NL*
I
allowed
it
to
become
quite
dark
.
I
was
without
a
light
in
that
room
;
*NL*
when
the
wind
shook
all
the
doors
,
behind
which
I
continually
expected
*NL*
to
see
some
spy
concealed
,
I
trembled
.
I
seemed
everywhere
to
hear
your
*NL*
moans
behind
me
in
the
bed
,
and
I
dared
not
turn
around
.
My
heart
beat
*NL*
so
violently
that
I
feared
my
wound
would
open
.
At
length
,
one
by
one
,
*NL*
all
the
noises
in
the
neighborhood
ceased
.
I
understood
that
I
had
*NL*
nothing
to
fear
,
that
I
should
neither
be
seen
nor
heard
,
so
I
decided
*NL*
upon
descending
to
the
garden
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
,
Hermine
;
I
consider
myself
as
brave
as
most
men
,
but
when
I
*NL*
drew
from
my
breast
the
little
key
of
the
staircase
,
which
I
had
found
*NL*
in
my
coat
--
that
little
key
we
both
used
to
cherish
so
much
,
which
you
*NL*
wished
to
have
fastened
to
a
golden
ring
--
when
I
opened
the
door
,
and
*NL*
saw
the
pale
moon
shedding
a
long
stream
of
white
light
on
the
spiral
*NL*
staircase
like
a
spectre
,
I
leaned
against
the
wall
,
and
nearly
*NL*
shrieked
.
I
seemed
to
be
going
mad
.
At
last
I
mastered
my
agitation
.
I
*NL*
descended
the
staircase
step
by
step
;
the
only
thing
I
could
not
conquer
*NL*
was
a
strange
trembling
in
my
knees
.
I
grasped
the
railings
;
if
I
had
*NL*
relaxed
my
hold
for
a
moment
,
I
should
have
fallen
.
I
reached
the
lower
*NL*
door
.
Outside
this
door
a
spade
was
placed
against
the
wall
;
I
took
*NL*
it
,
and
advanced
towards
the
thicket
.
I
had
provided
myself
with
a
*NL*
dark
lantern
.
In
the
middle
of
the
lawn
I
stopped
to
light
it
,
then
I
*NL*
continued
my
path
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
the
end
of
November
,
all
the
verdure
of
the
garden
had
*NL*
disappeared
,
the
trees
were
nothing
more
than
skeletons
with
their
long
*NL*
bony
arms
,
and
the
dead
leaves
sounded
on
the
gravel
under
my
feet
.
My
*NL*
terror
overcame
me
to
such
a
degree
as
I
approached
the
thicket
,
that
*NL*
I
took
a
pistol
from
my
pocket
and
armed
myself
.
I
fancied
continually
*NL*
that
I
saw
the
figure
of
the
Corsican
between
the
branches
.
I
examined
*NL*
the
thicket
with
my
dark
lantern
;
it
was
empty
.
I
looked
carefully
*NL*
around
;
I
was
indeed
alone
,
--
no
noise
disturbed
the
silence
but
the
owl
,
*NL*
whose
piercing
cry
seemed
to
be
calling
up
the
phantoms
of
the
night
.
*NL*
I
tied
my
lantern
to
a
forked
branch
I
had
noticed
a
year
before
at
the
*NL*
precise
spot
where
I
stopped
to
dig
the
hole
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
grass
had
grown
very
thickly
there
during
the
summer
,
and
when
*NL*
autumn
arrived
no
one
had
been
there
to
mow
it
.
Still
one
place
where
*NL*
the
grass
was
thin
attracted
my
attention
;
it
evidently
was
there
I
had
*NL*
turned
up
the
ground
.
I
went
to
work
.
The
hour
,
then
,
for
which
I
had
*NL*
been
waiting
during
the
last
year
had
at
length
arrived
.
How
I
worked
,
*NL*
how
I
hoped
,
how
I
struck
every
piece
of
turf
,
thinking
to
find
some
*NL*
resistance
to
my
spade
!
But
no
,
I
found
nothing
,
though
I
had
made
a
*NL*
hole
twice
as
large
as
the
first
.
I
thought
I
had
been
deceived
--
had
*NL*
mistaken
the
spot
.
I
turned
around
,
I
looked
at
the
trees
,
I
tried
to
*NL*
recall
the
details
which
had
struck
me
at
the
time
.
A
cold
,
sharp
wind
*NL*
whistled
through
the
leafless
branches
,
and
yet
the
drops
fell
from
my
*NL*
forehead
.
I
recollected
that
I
was
stabbed
just
as
I
was
trampling
*NL*
the
ground
to
fill
up
the
hole
;
while
doing
so
I
had
leaned
against
a
*NL*
laburnum
;
behind
me
was
an
artificial
rockery
,
intended
to
serve
as
a
*NL*
resting-place
for
persons
walking
in
the
garden
;
in
falling
,
my
hand
,
*NL*
relaxing
its
hold
of
the
laburnum
,
felt
the
coldness
of
the
stone
.
On
my
*NL*
right
I
saw
the
tree
,
behind
me
the
rock
.
I
stood
in
the
same
attitude
,
*NL*
and
threw
myself
down
.
I
rose
,
and
again
began
digging
and
enlarging
the
*NL*
hole
;
still
I
found
nothing
,
nothing
--
the
chest
was
no
longer
there
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
chest
no
longer
there
?
''
murmured
Madame
Danglars
,
choking
with
*NL*
fear
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Think
not
I
contented
myself
with
this
one
effort
,
''
continued
*NL*
Villefort
.
``
No
;
I
searched
the
whole
thicket
.
I
thought
the
assassin
,
*NL*
having
discovered
the
chest
,
and
supposing
it
to
be
a
treasure
,
had
*NL*
intended
carrying
it
off
,
but
,
perceiving
his
error
,
had
dug
another
*NL*
hole
,
and
deposited
it
there
;
but
I
could
find
nothing
.
Then
the
idea
*NL*
struck
me
that
he
had
not
taken
these
precautions
,
and
had
simply
thrown
*NL*
it
in
a
corner
.
In
the
last
case
I
must
wait
for
daylight
to
renew
my
*NL*
search
.
I
remained
in
the
room
and
waited
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
heavens
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
daylight
dawned
I
went
down
again
.
My
first
visit
was
to
the
*NL*
thicket
.
I
hoped
to
find
some
traces
which
had
escaped
me
in
the
*NL*
darkness
.
I
had
turned
up
the
earth
over
a
surface
of
more
than
twenty
*NL*
feet
square
,
and
a
depth
of
two
feet
.
A
laborer
would
not
have
done
in
*NL*
a
day
what
occupied
me
an
hour
.
But
I
could
find
nothing
--
absolutely
*NL*
nothing
.
Then
I
renewed
the
search
.
Supposing
it
had
been
thrown
aside
,
*NL*
it
would
probably
be
on
the
path
which
led
to
the
little
gate
;
but
this
*NL*
examination
was
as
useless
as
the
first
,
and
with
a
bursting
heart
I
*NL*
returned
to
the
thicket
,
which
now
contained
no
hope
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
cried
Madame
Danglars
,
``
it
was
enough
to
drive
you
mad
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hoped
for
a
moment
that
it
might
,
''
said
Villefort
;
``
but
that
*NL*
happiness
was
denied
me
.
However
,
recovering
my
strength
and
my
ideas
,
*NL*
`
Why
,
'
said
I
,
`
should
that
man
have
carried
away
the
corpse
?
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
said
,
''
replied
Madame
Danglars
,
``
he
would
require
it
as
a
*NL*
proof
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
no
,
madame
,
that
could
not
be
.
Dead
bodies
are
not
kept
a
year
;
*NL*
they
are
shown
to
a
magistrate
,
and
the
evidence
is
taken
.
Now
,
nothing
*NL*
of
the
kind
has
happened
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
then
?
''
asked
Hermine
,
trembling
violently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Something
more
terrible
,
more
fatal
,
more
alarming
for
us
--
the
child
*NL*
was
,
perhaps
,
alive
,
and
the
assassin
may
have
saved
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Danglars
uttered
a
piercing
cry
,
and
,
seizing
Villefort
's
hands
,
*NL*
exclaimed
,
``
My
child
was
alive
?
''
said
she
;
``
you
buried
my
child
alive
?
*NL*
You
were
not
certain
my
child
was
dead
,
and
you
buried
it
?
Ah
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Danglars
had
risen
,
and
stood
before
the
procureur
,
whose
hands
*NL*
she
wrung
in
her
feeble
grasp
.
``
I
know
not
;
I
merely
suppose
so
,
as
I
*NL*
might
suppose
anything
else
,
''
replied
Villefort
with
a
look
so
fixed
,
*NL*
it
indicated
that
his
powerful
mind
was
on
the
verge
of
despair
and
*NL*
madness
.
``
Ah
,
my
child
,
my
poor
child
!
''
cried
the
baroness
,
falling
*NL*
on
her
chair
,
and
stifling
her
sobs
in
her
handkerchief
.
Villefort
,
*NL*
becoming
somewhat
reassured
,
perceived
that
to
avert
the
maternal
storm
*NL*
gathering
over
his
head
,
he
must
inspire
Madame
Danglars
with
the
terror
*NL*
he
felt
.
``
You
understand
,
then
,
that
if
it
were
so
,
''
said
he
,
rising
in
*NL*
his
turn
,
and
approaching
the
baroness
,
to
speak
to
her
in
a
lower
tone
,
*NL*
``
we
are
lost
.
This
child
lives
,
and
some
one
knows
it
lives

some
one
is
*NL*
in
possession
of
our
secret
;
and
since
Monte
Cristo
speaks
before
us
of
*NL*
a
child
disinterred
,
when
that
child
could
not
be
found
,
it
is
he
who
is
*NL*
in
possession
of
our
secret
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
God
,
avenging
God
!
''
murmured
Madame
Danglars
.
*NL*
*NL*
Villefort
's
only
answer
was
a
stifled
groan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
the
child
--
the
child
,
sir
?
''
repeated
the
agitated
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
I
have
searched
for
him
,
''
replied
Villefort
,
wringing
his
hands
;
*NL*
``
how
I
have
called
him
in
my
long
sleepless
nights

how
I
have
longed

for
royal
wealth
to
purchase
a
million
of
secrets
from
a
million
of
men
,
*NL*
and
to
find
mine
among
them
!
At
last
,
one
day
,
when
for
the
hundredth
*NL*
time
I
took
up
my
spade
,
I
asked
myself
again
and
again
what
the
*NL*
Corsican
could
have
done
with
the
child
.
A
child
encumbers
a
fugitive
;
*NL*
perhaps
,
on
perceiving
it
was
still
alive
,
he
had
thrown
it
into
the
*NL*
river
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Impossible
!
''
cried
Madame
Danglars
:
``
a
man
may
murder
another
out
of
*NL*
revenge
,
but
he
would
not
deliberately
drown
a
child

*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
,
''
continued
Villefort
,
``
he
had
put
it
in
the
foundling
*NL*
hospital

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
yes
,
''
cried
the
baroness
;
``
my
child
is
there
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ran
to
the
hospital
,
and
learned
that
the
same
night
--
the
night
of
*NL*
the
20th
of
September
--
a
child
had
been
brought
there
,
wrapped
in
part
*NL*
of
a
fine
linen
napkin
,
purposely
torn
in
half
.
This
portion
of
the
*NL*
napkin
was
marked
with
half
a
baron
's
crown
,
and
the
letter
H.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Truly
,
truly
,
''
said
Madame
Danglars
,
``
all
my
linen
is
marked
thus
;
*NL*
Monsieur
de
Nargonne
was
a
baronet
,
and
my
name
is
Hermine

Thank
God
,
*NL*
my
child
was
not
then
dead
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
it
was
not
dead

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
can
tell
me
so
without
fearing
to
make
me
die
of
joy
?
Where
is
*NL*
the
child
?
''
Villefort
shrugged
his
shoulders
.
``
Do
I
know
?

said
he
;
``
and
*NL*
do
you
believe
that
if
I
knew
I
would
relate
to
you
all
its
trials

all
its
adventures
as
would
a
dramatist
or
a
novel
writer
?
Alas
,
no
,
*NL*
I
know
not

A
woman
,
about
six
months
after
,
came
to
claim
it
with
the
*NL*
other
half
of
the
napkin

This
woman
gave
all
the
requisite
particulars

it
was
intrusted
to
her

``
And
what
do
you

feigned
a
criminal
process

all
the
most
acute
bloodhounds
and
skilful
agents
in
search
of
her

They

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

forever

''
Madame
Danglars
had
listened
to
this
recital
with
a
*NL*
sigh
,
a
tear
,
or
a
shriek
for
every
detail
.
``
And
this
is
all
?
''
said
she
;
*NL*
``
and
you
stopped
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
''
said
Villefort
;
``
I
never
ceased
to
search
and
to
inquire
.
*NL*
However
,
the
last
two
or
three
years
I
had
allowed
myself
some
respite
.
*NL*
But
now
I
will
begin
with
more
perseverance
and
fury
than
ever
,
since
*NL*
fear
urges
me
,
not
my
conscience
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
''
replied
Madame
Danglars
,
``
the
Count
of
Monte
Cristo
can
know
*NL*
nothing
,
or
he
would
not
seek
our
society
as
he
does
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
the
wickedness
of
man
is
very
great
,
''
said
Villefort
,
``
since
it
*NL*
surpasses
the
goodness
of
God
.
Did
you
observe
that
man
's
eyes
while
he
*NL*
was
speaking
to
us
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
have
you
ever
watched
him
carefully
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Doubtless
he
is
capricious
,
but
that
is
all
;
one
thing
alone
struck
*NL*
me
,
--
of
all
the
exquisite
things
he
placed
before
us
,
he
touched
*NL*
nothing
.
I
might
have
suspected
he
was
poisoning
us
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
see
you
would
have
been
deceived

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
doubtless
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
believe
me
,
that
man
has
other
projects

For
that
reason
I
*NL*
wished
to
see
you
,
to
speak
to
you
,
to
warn
you
against
every
one
,
but
*NL*
especially
against
him
.
Tell
me
,
''
cried
Villefort
,
fixing
his
eyes
more
*NL*
steadfastly
on
her
than
he
had
ever
done
before
,
``
did
you
ever
reveal
to
*NL*
any
one
our
connection
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Never

to
any
one

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
understand
me

replied
Villefort
,
affectionately
;
``
when
I
say
any
*NL*
one
,

pardon
my
urgency
,

any
one
living
I
mean

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes

well

ejaculated
the
baroness
;
``
never
,
I
*NL*
swear
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Were
you
ever
in
the
habit
of
writing
in
the
evening
what
had
*NL*
transpired
in
the
morning
?
Do
you
keep
a
journal
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

my
life
has
been
passed
in
frivolity

I
wish

*NL*
``
Do
you
talk
in

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
sleep
soundly

you
not
remember

''
The
color
mounted
*NL*
to
the
baroness
's
face
,
and
Villefort
turned
awfully
pale
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
true
,
''
said
he
,
in
so
low
a
tone
that
he
could
hardly
be
heard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
said
the
baroness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
understand
what
I
now
have
to
do
,
''
replied
Villefort
.
``
In
*NL*
less
than
one
week
from
this
time
I
will
ascertain
who
this
M.

Monte
*NL*
Cristo
is
,
whence
he
comes
,
where
he
goes
,
and
why
he
speaks
in
our
*NL*
presence
of
children
that
have
been
disinterred
in
a
garden
.
''
Villefort
*NL*
pronounced
these
words
with
an
accent
which
would
have
made
the
*NL*
count
shudder
had
he
heard
him
.
Then
he
pressed
the
hand
the
baroness
*NL*
reluctantly
gave
him
,
and
led
her
respectfully
back
to
the
door
.
Madame
*NL*
Danglars
returned
in
another
cab
to
the
passage
,
on
the
other
side
of
*NL*
which
she
found
her
carriage
,
and
her
coachman
sleeping
peacefully
on
*NL*
his
box
while
waiting
for
her

Chapter
68
.
A
Summer
Ball
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
same
day
during
the
interview
between
Madame
Danglars
and
the
*NL*
procureur
,
a
travelling-carriage
entered
the
Rue
du
Helder
,
passed
*NL*
through
the
gateway
of
No.
27
,
and
stopped
in
the
yard
.
In
a
moment
the
*NL*
door
was
opened
,
and
Madame
de
Morcerf
alighted
,
leaning
on
her
son
's
*NL*
arm
.
Albert
soon
left
her
,
ordered
his
horses
,
and
having
arranged
his
*NL*
toilet
,
drove
to
the
Champs
Elysees
,
to
the
house
of
Monte
Cristo
.
The
*NL*
count
received
him
with
his
habitual
smile
.
It
was
a
strange
thing
that
*NL*
no
one
ever
appeared
to
advance
a
step
in
that
man
's
favor
.
Those
who
*NL*
would
,
as
it
were
,
force
a
passage
to
his
heart
,
found
an
impassable
*NL*
barrier
.
Morcerf
,
who
ran
towards
him
with
open
arms
,
was
chilled
as
he
*NL*
drew
near
,
in
spite
of
the
friendly
smile
,
and
simply
held
out
his
hand
.
*NL*
Monte
Cristo
shook
it
coldly
,
according
to
his
invariable
practice
.
*NL*
``
Here
I
am
,
dear
count
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Welcome

again

*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
``

``

come
at
once
to
see
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
extremely
kind
of
you

said
Monte
Cristo
with
a
tone
of
*NL*
perfect
indifference
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
is
the
news
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You

not
ask

*NL*
*NL*

I

it

*NL*

Albert

much

*NL*
``

*NL*
M.

kept

promise
he
had
made
to

,
to
*NL*
endeavor
to
find
out
how
the
Count
of
Monte
Cristo
had
discovered
the
*NL*
history
of
the
house
at
Auteuil
.
He
wrote
the
same
day
for
the
required
*NL*
information
to
M.
de
Boville
,
who
,
from
having
been
an
inspector
of
*NL*
prisons
,
was
promoted
to
a
high
office
in
the
police
;
and
the
latter
*NL*
begged
for
two
days
time
to
ascertain
exactly
who
would

likely

to
give
him
full
particulars

At
the
end
of
the
second
day
M.
de

Villefort
received
the
following
note
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
person
called
the
Count
of
Monte
Cristo
is
an
intimate
acquaintance
*NL*
of
Lord
Wilmore
,
a
rich
foreigner
,
who
is
sometimes
seen
in
Paris
and
*NL*
who
is
there
at
this
moment
;
he
is
also
known
to
the
Abbe
Busoni
,
a
*NL*
Sicilian
priest
,
of
high
repute
in
the
East
,
where
he
has
done
much
*NL*
good
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
de
Villefort
replied
by
ordering
the
strictest
inquiries
to
be
*NL*
made
respecting
these
two
persons
;
his
orders
were
executed
,
and
the
*NL*
following
evening
he
received
these
details
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
abbe
,
who
was
in
Paris
only
for
a
month
,
inhabited
a
small
*NL*
two-storied
house
behind
Saint-Sulpice
;
there
were
two
rooms
on
each
*NL*
floor
and
he
was
the
only
tenant
.
The
two
lower
rooms
consisted
of
a
*NL*
dining-room
,
with
a
table
,
chairs
,
and
side-board
of
walnut
,
--
and
a
*NL*
wainscoted
parlor
,
without
ornaments
,
carpet
,
or
timepiece
.
It
was
*NL*
evident
that
the
abbe
limited
himself
to
objects
of
strict
necessity
.
He
*NL*
preferred
to
use
the
sitting-room
upstairs
,
which
was
more
library
than
*NL*
parlor
,
and
was
furnished
with
theological
books
and
parchments
,
in
*NL*
which
he
delighted
to
bury
himself
for
months
at
a
time
,
according
to
*NL*
his
valet
de
chambre
.
His
valet
looked
at
the
visitors
through
a
sort
*NL*
of
wicket
;
and
if
their
faces
were
unknown
to
him
or
displeased
him
,
he
*NL*
replied
that
the
abbe
was
not
in
Paris
,
an
answer
which
satisfied
most
*NL*
persons
,
because
the
abbe
was
known
to
be
a
great
traveller
.
Besides
,
*NL*
whether
at
home
or
not
,
whether
in
Paris
or
Cairo
,
the
abbe
always
left
*NL*
something
to
give
away
,
which
the
valet
distributed
through
this
wicket
*NL*
in
his
master
's
name
.
The
other
room
near
the
library
was
a
bedroom
.
A
*NL*
bed
without
curtains
,
four
arm-chairs
,
and
a
couch
,
covered
with
yellow
*NL*
Utrecht
velvet
,
composed
,
with
a
prie-Dieu
,
all
its
furniture
.
Lord
*NL*
Wilmore
resided
in
Rue
Fontaine-Saint-George
.
He
was
one
of
those
*NL*
English
tourists
who
consume
a
large
fortune
in
travelling
.
He
hired
the
*NL*
apartment
in
which
he
lived
furnished
,
passed
only
a
few
hours
in
the
*NL*
day
there
,
and
rarely
slept
there
.
One
of
his
peculiarities
was
never
to
*NL*
speak
a
word
of
French
,
which
he
however
wrote
with
great
facility
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
day
after
this
important
information
had
been
given
to
the
king
's
*NL*
attorney
,
a
man
alighted
from
a
carriage
at
the
corner
of
the
Rue
*NL*
Ferou
,
and
rapping
at
an
olive-green
door
,
asked
if
the
Abbe
Busoni
were
*NL*
within
.
``
No
,
he
went
out
early
this
morning
,
''
replied
the
valet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
might
not
always
be
content
with
that
answer
,
''
replied
the
visitor
,
*NL*
``
for
I
come
from
one
to
whom
everyone
must
be
at
home
.
But
have
the
*NL*
kindness
to
give
the
Abbe
Busoni
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
told
you
he
was
not
at
home
,
''
repeated
the
valet
.
``
Then
on
his
return
*NL*
give
him
that
card
and
this
sealed
paper
.
Will
he
be
at
home
at
eight
*NL*
o'clock
this
evening
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Doubtless
,
unless
he
is
at
work
,
which
is
the
same
as
if
he
were
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
come
again
at
that
time
,
''
replied
the
visitor
,
who
then
retired
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
appointed
hour
the
same
man
returned
in
the
same
carriage
,
which
,
*NL*
instead
of
stopping
this
time
at
the
end
of
the
Rue
Ferou
,
drove
up
to
*NL*
the
green
door
.
He
knocked
,
and
it
opened
immediately
to
admit
him
.
*NL*
From
the
signs
of
respect
the
valet
paid
him
,
he
saw
that
his
note
had
*NL*
produced
a
good
effect
.
``
Is
the
abbe
at
home
?
''
asked
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
he
is
at
work
in
his
library
,
but
he
expects
you
,
sir
,
''
replied
*NL*
the
valet
.
The
stranger
ascended
a
rough
staircase
,
and
before
a
table
,
*NL*
illumined
by
a
lamp
whose
light
was
concentrated
by
a
large
shade
while
*NL*
the
rest
of
the
apartment
was
in
partial
darkness
,
he
perceived
the
abbe
*NL*
in
a
monk
's
dress
,
with
a
cowl
on
his
head
such
as
was
used
by
learned
*NL*
men

*NL*
The

replaced
the
large
spectacles

which
covered
not

his
eyes

his
temples

sitting
down
motioned
to

do
the

said
the

marked
Italian

*NL*
*NL*
``
The
mission

the

speaking

The

bowed
.

Your

the

*NL*

I
am
a

the

At
this
moment
the
abbe
pressed
down
his
side

so
raised
*NL*
it
on
the

,
throwing
a
bright
light

his

remained
obscured

The

once
more
bowed

opened

bowed
and
took
his
leave

the
carriage
conveyed

him
straight
to

house
of
M.

Villefort

An
hour
afterwards
*NL*
the
carriage
was
again
ordered
,

this
time
it
went
to
the
Rue
*NL*
Fontaine-Saint-George
,
and
stopped
at
No.
5
,
where
Lord
Wilmore
lived
.
*NL*
The
stranger
had
written
to
Lord
Wilmore
,
requesting
an
interview
,
which
*NL*
the
latter
had
fixed
for
ten
o'clock
.
As
the
envoy
of
the
prefect
of
*NL*
police
arrived
ten
minutes
before
ten
,
he
was
told
that
Lord
Wilmore
,
*NL*
who
was
precision
and
punctuality
personified
,
was
not
yet
come
in
,
but
*NL*
that
he
would
be
sure
to
return
as
the
clock
struck
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
visitor
was
introduced
into
the
drawing-room
,
which
was
like
all
*NL*
other
furnished
drawing-rooms
.
A
mantle-piece
,
with
two
modern
Sevres
*NL*
vases
,
a
timepiece
representing
Cupid
with
his
bent
bow
,
a
mirror
with
*NL*
an
engraving
on
each
side
--
one
representing
Homer
carrying
his
*NL*
guide
,
the
other
,
Belisarius
begging
--
a
grayish
paper
;
red
and
black
*NL*
tapestry
--
such
was
the
appearance
of
Lord
Wilmore
's
drawing-room
.
It
was
*NL*
illuminated
by
lamps
with
ground-glass
shades
which
gave
only
a
feeble
*NL*
light
,
as
if
out
of
consideration
for
the
envoy
's
weak
sight
.
After
ten
*NL*
minutes
'
expectation
the
clock
struck
ten
;
at
the
fifth
stroke
the
door
*NL*
opened
and
Lord
Wilmore
appeared
.
He
was
rather
above
the
middle
height
,
*NL*
with
thin
reddish
whiskers
,
light
complexion
and
light
hair
,
turning
*NL*
rather
gray
.
He
was
dressed
with
all
the
English
peculiarity
,
namely
,
in
*NL*
a
blue
coat
,
with
gilt
buttons
and
high
collar
,
in
the
fashion
of
1811
,
*NL*
a
white
kerseymere
waistcoat
,
and
nankeen
pantaloons
,
three
inches
too
*NL*
short
,
but
which
were
prevented
by
straps
from
slipping
up
to
the
*NL*
knee
.
His
first
remark
on
entering
was
,
--
``
You
know
,
sir
,
I
do
not
speak
*NL*
French
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
you
do
not
like

converse

our
language

replied
the
envoy
.
*NL*
``
But
you
may
use
it
,
''
replied
Lord
Wilmore
;
``
I
understand
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
,
''
replied
the
visitor
,
changing
his
idiom
,
``
know
enough
of
*NL*
English
to
keep
up
the
conversation

Do
not
put
yourself
to
the
*NL*
slightest
inconvenience
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aw
?
''
said
Lord
Wilmore
,
with
that
tone
which
is
only
known
to
natives
*NL*
of
Great
Britain
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
envoy
presented
his
letter
of
introduction
,
which
the
latter
read
*NL*
with
English
coolness
,
and
having
finished
,
--
``
I
understand
,
''
said
he
,
*NL*
``
perfectly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
began
the
questions
,
which
were
similar
to
those
which
had
been
*NL*
addressed
to
the
Abbe
Busoni
.
But
as
Lord
Wilmore
,
in
the
character
of
*NL*
the
count
's
enemy
,
was
less
restrained
in
his
answers
,
they
were
more
*NL*
numerous
;
he
described
the
youth
of
Monte
Cristo
,
who
he
said
,
at
ten
*NL*
years
of
age
,
entered
the
service
of
one
of
the
petty
sovereigns
of
*NL*
India
who
make
war
on
the
English
.
It
was
there
Wilmore
had
first
met
*NL*
him
and
fought
against
him
;
and
in
that
war
Zaccone
had
been
taken
*NL*
prisoner
,
sent
to
England
,
and
consigned
to
the
hulks
,
whence
he
had
*NL*
escaped
by
swimming
.
Then
began
his
travels
,
his
duels
,
his
caprices
;
*NL*
then
the
insurrection
in
Greece
broke
out
,
and
he
had
served
in
the
*NL*
Grecian
ranks
.
While
in
that
service
he
had
discovered
a
silver
mine
in
*NL*
the
mountains
of
Thessaly
,
but
he
had
been
careful
to
conceal
it
from
*NL*
every
one
.
After
the
battle
of
Navarino
,
when
the
Greek
government
was
*NL*
consolidated
,
he
asked
of
King
Otho
a
mining
grant
for
that
district
,
*NL*
which
was
given
him
.
Hence
that
immense
fortune
,
which
,
in
Lord
*NL*
Wilmore
's
opinion
,
possibly
amounted
to
one
or
two
millions
per
*NL*
annum
,
--
a
precarious
fortune
,
which
might
be
momentarily
lost
by
the
*NL*
failure
of
the
mine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
''
asked
the
visitor
,
``
do
you
know
why
he
came
to
France
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
speculating
in
railways
,
''
said
Lord
Wilmore
,
``
and
as
he
is
*NL*
an
expert
chemist
and
physicist
,
he
has
invented
a
new
system
of
*NL*
telegraphy
,
which
he
is
seeking
to
bring
to
perfection
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
much
does
he
spend
yearly
?
''
asked
the
prefect
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
more
than
five
or
six
hundred
thousand
francs
,
''
said
Lord
Wilmore
;
*NL*
``
he
is
a
miser
.
''
Hatred
evidently
inspired
the
Englishman
,
who
,
knowing
*NL*
no
other
reproach
to
bring
on
the
count
,
accused
him
of
avarice
.
``
Do
you
*NL*
know
his
house
at
Auteuil
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
know
respecting
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
wish
to
know
why
he
bought
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
count
is
a
speculator
,
who
will
certainly
ruin
himself
in
*NL*
experiments
.
He
supposes
there
is
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
house
he
*NL*
has
bought
a
mineral
spring
equal
to
those
at
Bagneres
,
Luchon
,
and
*NL*
Cauterets
.
He
is
going
to
turn
his
house
into
a
Badhaus
,
as
the
Germans
*NL*
term
it
.
He
has
already
dug
up
all
the
garden
two
or
three
times
to
find
*NL*
the
famous
spring
,
and
,
being
unsuccessful
,
he
will
soon
purchase
all
*NL*
the
contiguous
houses
.
Now
,
as
I
dislike
him
,
and
hope
his
railway
,
*NL*
his
electric
telegraph
,
or
his
search
for
baths
,
will
ruin
him
,
I
am
*NL*
watching
for
his
discomfiture
,
which
must
soon
take
place
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
was
the
cause
of
your
quarrel
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
he
was
in
England
he
seduced
the
wife
of
one
of
my
friends
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
you
not
seek
revenge
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
already
fought
three
duels
with
him
,

said
the
Englishman
,
``
the
*NL*
first
with
the
pistol
,
the
second
with
the
sword
,
and
the
third
with
the

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
was
the
result
of
those
duels
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
The
first
time

he
broke
my
arm
;
the
second
,
he
wounded
me
in
the
*NL*
breast

and
the
third
time
,
made
this
large
wound
.
''
The
Englishman
*NL*
turned
down
his
shirt-collar
,
and
showed
a
scar
,
whose
redness
proved
*NL*
it
to
be
a
recent
one
.
``
So
that
,
you
see
,
there
is
a
deadly
feud
between
*NL*
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
''
said
the
envoy
,
``
you
do
not
go
about
it
in
the
right
way
to
kill
*NL*
him
,
if
I
understand
you
correctly

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aw

''
said
the
Englishman
,
``
I
practice
shooting
every
day

every
*NL*
other

comes
to

house

''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
all
the
visitor
wished
to
ascertain
,
or
,
rather
,
all
the
*NL*
Englishman
appeared
to
know
.
The
agent
arose
,
and
having
bowed
to
Lord
*NL*
Wilmore
,
who
returned
his
salutation
with
the
stiff
politeness
of
the
*NL*
English
,
he
retired
.
Lord
Wilmore
,
having
heard
the
door
close
after
*NL*
him
,
returned
to
his
bedroom
,
where
with
one
hand
he
pulled
off
his
*NL*
light
hair
,
his
red
whiskers
,
his
false
jaw
,
and
his
wound
,
to
resume
*NL*
the
black
hair
,
dark
complexion
,
and
pearly
teeth
of
the
Count
of
Monte
*NL*
Cristo
.
It
was
M.
de
Villefort
,
and
not
the
prefect
,
who
returned
to
the
*NL*
house
of
M.
de
Villefort
.
The
procureur
felt
more
at
ease
,
although
he
*NL*
had
learned
nothing
really
satisfactory
,
and
,
for
the
first
time
since
*NL*
the
dinner-party
at
Auteuil
,
he
slept
soundly
.

Chapter
70
.
The
Ball
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
in
the
warmest
days
of
July
,
when
in
due
course
of
time
the
*NL*
Saturday
arrived
upon
which
the
ball
was
to
take
place
at
M.
de
*NL*
Morcerf
's
.
It
was
ten
o'clock
at
night
;
the
branches
of
the
great
trees
*NL*
in
the
garden
of
the
count
's
house
stood
out
boldly
against
the
azure
*NL*
canopy
of
heaven
,
which
was
studded
with
golden
stars
,
but
where
*NL*
the
last
fleeting
clouds
of
a
vanishing
storm
yet
lingered
.
From
the
*NL*
apartments
on
the
ground-floor
might
be
heard
the
sound
of
music
,
with
*NL*
the
whirl
of
the
waltz
and
galop
,
while
brilliant
streams
of
light
shone
*NL*
through
the
openings
of
the
Venetian
blinds
.
At
this
moment
the
garden
*NL*
was
only
occupied
by
about
ten
servants
,
who
had
just
received
orders
*NL*
from
their
mistress
to
prepare
the
supper
,
the
serenity
of
the
weather
*NL*
continuing
to
increase
.
Until
now
,
it
had
been
undecided
whether
the
*NL*
supper
should
take
place
in
the
dining-room
,
or
under
a
long
tent
*NL*
erected
on
the
lawn
,
but
the
beautiful
blue
sky
,
studded
with
stars
,
had
*NL*
settled
the
question
in
favor
of
the
lawn
.
The
gardens
were
illuminated
*NL*
with
colored
lanterns
,
according
to
the
Italian
custom
,
and
,
as
is
usual
*NL*
in
countries
where
the
luxuries
of
the
table
--
the
rarest
of
all
luxuries
*NL*
in
their
complete
form
--
are
well
understood
,
the
supper-table
was
loaded
*NL*
with
wax-lights
and
flowers
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
time
the
Countess
of
Morcerf
returned
to
the
rooms
,
after
giving
*NL*
her
orders
,
many
guests
were
arriving
,
more
attracted
by
the
charming
*NL*
hospitality
of
the
countess
than
by
the
distinguished
position
of
the
*NL*
count
;
for
,
owing
to
the
good
taste
of
Mercedes
,
one
was
sure
of
finding
*NL*
some
devices
at
her
entertainment
worthy
of
describing
,
or
even
copying
*NL*
in
case
of
need
.
Madame
Danglars
,
in
whom
the
events
we
have
related
had
*NL*
caused
deep
anxiety
,
had
hesitated
about
going
to
Madame
de
Morcerf
's
,
*NL*
when
during
the
morning
her
carriage
happened
to
meet
that
of
Villefort
.
*NL*
The
latter
made
a
sign
,
and
when
the
carriages
had
drawn
close
together
,
*NL*
said
,
--
``
You
are
going
to
Madame
de
Morcerf
's
,
are
you
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
replied
Madame
Danglars
,
``
I
am
too
ill
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
wrong
,
''
replied
Villefort
,
significantly
;
``
it
is
important
that
*NL*
you
should
be
seen
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
so
?
''
asked
the
baroness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
that
case
I
will
go
.
''
And
the
two
carriages
passed
on
towards
*NL*
their
different
destinations
.
Madame
Danglars
therefore
came
,
not
only
*NL*
beautiful
in
person
,
but
radiant
with
splendor
;
she
entered
by
one
door
*NL*
at
the
time
when
Mercedes
appeared
at
the
door
.
The
countess
took
Albert
*NL*
to
meet
Madame
Danglars
.
He
approached
,
paid
her
some
well
merited
*NL*
compliments
on
her
toilet
,
and
offered
his
arm
to
conduct
her
to
a
seat
.
*NL*
Albert
looked
around
him
.
``
You
are
looking
for
my
daughter
?
''
said
the
*NL*
baroness
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
confess
it
,
''
replied
Albert
.
``
Could
you
have
been
so
cruel
as
not
to
*NL*
bring
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Calm
yourself
.
She
has
met
Mademoiselle
de
Villefort
,
and
has
taken
*NL*
her
arm
;
see
,
they
are
following
us
,
both
in
white
dresses
,
one
with
a
*NL*
bouquet
of
camellias
,
the
other
with
one
of
myosotis
.
But
tell
me

--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
do
you
wish
to
know

*NL*
*NL*
``

not
the
Count
of
Monte
Cristo

*NL*
*NL*
``

replied
Albert
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
only
mean

the
rage

replied
the
viscount
,
*NL*
smiling
,
``

you
are
the
seventeenth
person

has
asked

*NL*

*NL*
*NL*

Elssler
was
dancing
in

Boiteux

the
Greek
princess
was
in
ecstasies

After
the
cachucha
he
*NL*
placed
a
magnificent
ring
on
the
stem
of
a
bouquet

threw
it
to

charming
danseuse

,
in

third

to
do

as
a
*NL*
vagabond
,
on
the
pretext
of
his
being
too
rich
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
that
doubtless
would
have
happened
if
his
credentials
had
not
*NL*
been
so
favorable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
count
!
And
is
he
aware
of
the
danger
he
has
been
in
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
it
will
be
but
charitable
to
inform
him
.
When
he
arrives
,
I
will
*NL*
not
fail
to
do
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Just
then
,
a
handsome
young
man
,
with
bright
eyes
,
black
hair
,
and
*NL*
glossy
mustache
,
respectfully
bowed
to
Madame
de
Villefort
.
Albert
*NL*
extended
his
hand
.
``
Madame
,
''
said
Albert
,
``
allow
me
to
present
to
you
M.
*NL*
Maximilian
Morrel
,
captain
of
Spahis
,
one
of
our
best
,
and
,
above
all
,
*NL*
of
our
bravest
officers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
already
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
this
gentleman
at
Auteuil
,
*NL*
at
the
house
of
the
Count
of
Monte
Cristo
,
''
replied
Madame
de
Villefort
,
*NL*
turning
away
with
marked
coldness
of
manner
.
This
answer
,
and
especially
*NL*
the
tone
in
which
it
was
uttered
,
chilled
the
heart
of
poor
Morrel
.
But
*NL*
a
recompense
was
in
store
for
him
;
turning
around
,
he
saw
near
the
door
*NL*
a
beautiful
fair
face
,
whose
large
blue
eyes
were
,
without
any
marked
*NL*
expression
,
fixed
upon
him
,
while
the
bouquet
of
myosotis
was
gently
*NL*
raised
to
her
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
salutation
was
so
well
understood
that
Morrel
,
with
the
same
*NL*
expression
in
his
eyes
,
placed
his
handkerchief
to
his
mouth
;
and
these
*NL*
two
living
statues
,
whose
hearts
beat
so
violently
under
their
marble
*NL*
aspect
,
separated
from
each
other
by
the
whole
length
of
the
room
,
*NL*
forgot
themselves
for
a
moment
,
or
rather
forgot
the
world
in
their
*NL*
mutual
contemplation
.
They
might
have
remained
much
longer
lost
in
one
*NL*
another
,
without
any
one
noticing
their
abstraction
.
The
Count
of
Monte
*NL*
Cristo
had
just
entered
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
have
already
said
that
there
was
something
in
the
count
which
*NL*
attracted
universal
attention
wherever
he
appeared
.
It
was
not
the
coat
,
*NL*
unexceptional
in
its
cut
,
though
simple
and
unornamented
;
it
was
not
the
*NL*
plain
white
waistcoat
;
it
was
not
the
trousers
,
that
displayed
the
foot
*NL*
so
perfectly
formed
--
it
was
none
of
these
things
that
attracted
the
*NL*
attention
,
--
it
was
his
pale
complexion
,
his
waving
black
hair
,
his
calm
*NL*
and
serene
expression
,
his
dark
and
melancholy
eye
,
his
mouth
,
chiselled
*NL*
with
such
marvellous
delicacy
,
which
so
easily
expressed
such
high
*NL*
disdain
,
--
these
were
what
fixed
the
attention
of
all
upon
him
.
Many
*NL*
men
might
have
been
handsomer
,
but
certainly
there
could
be
none
*NL*
whose
appearance
was
more
significant
,
if
the
expression
may
be
used
.
*NL*
Everything
about
the
count
seemed
to
have
its
meaning
,
for
the
constant
*NL*
habit
of
thought
which
he
had
acquired
had
given
an
ease
and
vigor
*NL*
to
the
expression
of
his
face
,
and
even
to
the
most
trifling
gesture
,
*NL*
scarcely
to
be
understood
.
Yet
the
Parisian
world
is
so
strange
,
that
*NL*
even
all
this
might
not
have
won
attention
had
there
not
been
connected
*NL*
with
it
a
mysterious
story
gilded
by
an
immense
fortune
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
he
advanced
through
the
assemblage
of
guests
under
a
battery
*NL*
of
curious
glances
towards
Madame
de
Morcerf
,
who
,
standing
before
*NL*
a
mantle-piece
ornamented
with
flowers
,
had
seen
his
entrance
in
a
*NL*
looking-glass
placed
opposite
the
door
,
and
was
prepared
to
receive
him
.
*NL*
She
turned
towards
him
with
a
serene
smile
just
at
the
moment
he
was
*NL*
bowing
to
her
.
No
doubt
she
fancied
the
count
would
speak
to
her
,
while
*NL*
on
his
side
the
count
thought
she
was
about
to
address
him
;
but
both
*NL*
remained
silent
,
and
after
a
mere
bow
,
Monte
Cristo
directed
his
steps
*NL*
to
Albert
,
who
received
him
cordially
.
``
Have
you
seen
my
mother
?
''
asked
*NL*
Albert
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
just
had
the
pleasure
,
''
replied
the
count
;
``
but
I
have
not
seen
*NL*
your
father
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
See
,
he
is
down
there
,
talking
politics
with
that
little
group
of
great
*NL*
geniuses
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
?
''
said
Monte
Cristo
;
``
and
so
those
gentlemen
down
there
are
*NL*
men
of
great
talent
.
I
should
not
have
guessed
it
.
And
for
what
kind
of
*NL*
talent
are
they
celebrated
?
You
know
there
are
different
sorts
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
tall
,
harsh-looking
man
is
very
learned
,
he
discovered
,
in
the
*NL*
neighborhood
of
Rome
,
a
kind
of
lizard
with
a
vertebra
more
than
*NL*
lizards
usually
have
,
and
he
immediately
laid
his
discovery
before
the
*NL*
Institute
.
The
thing
was
discussed
for
a
long
time
,
but
finally
decided
*NL*
in
his
favor
.
I
can
assure
you
the
vertebra
made
a
great
noise
in
the
*NL*
learned
world
,
and
the
gentleman
,
who
was
only
a
knight
of
the
Legion
of
*NL*
Honor
,
was
made
an
officer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
''
said
Monte
Cristo
,
``
this
cross
seems
to
me
to
be
wisely
awarded
.
*NL*
I
suppose
,
had
he
found
another
additional
vertebra
,
they
would
have
*NL*
made
him
a
commander
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
likely
,
''
said
Albert
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
who
can
that
person
be
who
has
taken
it
into
his
head
to
wrap
*NL*
himself
up
in
a
blue
coat
embroidered
with
green
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
that
coat
is
not
his
own
idea
;
it
is
the
Republic

,
which
deputed

to
devise
a
uniform
for

Louis
David

famous
French
painter

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
Monte

;
``
so
this
gentleman
is
an
Academician

*NL*
*NL*
``
Within
the
last
week
he
has
been
made

what
is
his
especial
talent

*NL*
*NL*
``
His
talent

I
believe
he
thrusts
pins
through
the
heads
of
rabbits

,
and
punches
the
spinal
marrow
out

whalebone

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

going

tell

very
considerably
advanced

No

Albert
laughed

demanded
the

``
Yes

``
Yes

most
active

the
Chamber
of

He
was
very
*NL*
successful
upon
that
question

He
stood
badly
with
the
Liberal
papers
,
*NL*
but
his
noble
opposition
to
the
wishes

the
court
is
now
getting
him

into
favor

talk

*NL*
*NL*

``

Just
then
the

felt
his

pressed

turned

round
;
it
was
Danglars

*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly

replied
Albert

``
seeing

*NL*
*NL*
``

me
the

Danglars

*NL*
``
Unfortunately

said
Monte

Danglars

becoming
pale

*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*

late

Danglars

``
I
have
honored

*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
''
said
Monte

,
``
here
are
200,000
francs
gone
after

--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hush
,
do
not
mention
these
things

said
Danglars
;
then
,
approaching
*NL*
Monte
Cristo
,
he
added
,
``
especially
before
young
M.
Cavalcanti
;
''
after
*NL*
which
he
smiled
,
and
turned
towards
the
young
man
in
question
.
Albert
*NL*
had
left
the
count
to
speak
to
his
mother
,
Danglars
to
converse
with
*NL*
young
Cavalcanti
;
Monte
Cristo
was
for
an
instant
alone
.
Meanwhile
the
*NL*
heat
became
excessive
.
The
footmen
were
hastening
through
the
rooms
with
*NL*
waiters
loaded
with
ices
.
Monte
Cristo
wiped
the
perspiration
from
his
*NL*
forehead
,
but
drew
back
when
the
waiter
was
presented
to
him
;
he
took
no
*NL*
refreshment
.
Madame
de
Morcerf
did
not
lose
sight
of
Monte
Cristo
;
she
*NL*
saw
that
he
took
nothing
,
and
even
noticed
his
gesture
of
refusal
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Albert
,
''
she
asked
,
``
did
you
notice
that

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What

mother

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

but
then
he
breakfasted
with
me

indeed

he
made
his
first

appearance
in
the
world
on
that
occasion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
your
house
is
not
M.

Morcerf

murmured
Mercedes
;
``
and
since
*NL*
he

been

I
have
watched
him

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

*NL*
*NL*

Mercedes
smiled
sadly

``
Approach
him

*NL*

she
,
``

when
the
next
waiter
passes

insist

something

``
But
why

mother

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
to

me

Albert

said
Mercedes
.
Albert
kissed
his
mother
's
*NL*
hand
,
and
drew
near
the
count
.
Another
salver
passed
,
loaded
like
the
*NL*
preceding
ones
;
she
saw
Albert
attempt
to
persuade
the
count
,
but
he
*NL*
obstinately
refused

Albert
rejoined
his
mother
;
she
was
very
pale
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

said
she
,
``
you
see
he
refuses

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

why
need
this
annoy
you

*NL*
*NL*
``

only
an
ice

Perhaps
he
*NL*
can
not
reconcile
himself
to

French
style

might
prefer
*NL*
something
else

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

not

evening

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
besides

said
the
countess
,
``
accustomed

burning

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not

complained

Venetian
blinds

not
opened
as
well

the
windows

*NL*
*NL*
``
In

it
was
a
way

And
she
left
the
room

A
minute
afterwards
*NL*
the
blinds
were
thrown
open
,
and
through
the
jessamine
and
clematis
that
*NL*
overhung
the
window
one
could
see
the
garden
ornamented
with
lanterns
,
*NL*
and
the
supper
laid
under
the
tent
.
Dancers
,
players
,
talkers
,
all
*NL*
uttered
an
exclamation
of
joy
--
every
one
inhaled
with
delight
the
*NL*
breeze
that
floated
in
.
At
the
same
time
Mercedes
reappeared
,
paler
than
*NL*
before
,
but
with
that
imperturbable
expression
of
countenance
which
*NL*
she
sometimes
wore
.
She
went
straight
to
the
group
of
which
her
husband
*NL*
formed
the
centre
.
``
Do
not
detain
those
gentlemen
here
,
count
,
''
she
*NL*
said
;
``
they
would
prefer
,
I
should
think
,
to
breathe
in
the
garden
*NL*
rather
than
suffocate
here
,
since
they
are
not
playing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
said
a
gallant
old
general
,
who
,
in
1809
,
had
sung
``
Partant
pour
*NL*
la
Syrie
,
''
--
``
we
will
not
go
alone
to
the
garden
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
''
said
Mercedes
,
``
I
will
lead
the
way
.
''
Turning
towards
Monte
*NL*
Cristo
,
she
added
,
``
count
,
will
you
oblige
me
with
your
arm
?
''
The
*NL*
count
almost
staggered
at
these
simple
words
;
then
he
fixed
his
eyes
on
*NL*
Mercedes
.
It
was
only
a
momentary
glance
,
but
it
seemed
to
the
countess
*NL*
to
have
lasted
for
a
century
,
so
much
was
expressed
in
that
one
look
.
He
*NL*
offered
his
arm
to
the
countess
;
she
took
it
,
or
rather
just
touched
it
*NL*
with
her
little
hand
,
and
they
together
descended
the
steps
,
lined
with
*NL*
rhododendrons
and
camellias
.
Behind
them
,
by
another
outlet
,
a
group
of
*NL*
about
twenty
persons
rushed
into
the
garden
with
loud
exclamations
of
*NL*
delight
.

*NL*
Madame
de
Morcerf
entered
an
archway
of
trees
with
her
companion
.
It
led
*NL*
through
a
grove
of
lindens
to
a
conservatory
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
too
warm
in
the

,
was
it
not
,
count
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
madame
;
and
it
was
an
excellent
idea
of
yours
to
open
the
doors
*NL*
and
the
blinds
.
''
As
he
ceased
speaking
,
the
count
felt
the
hand
of
*NL*
Mercedes
tremble
.
``
But
you
,
''
he
said
,
``
with
that
light
dress
,
and
*NL*
without
anything
to
cover
you
but
that
gauze
scarf
,
perhaps
you
feel
*NL*
cold
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
where
I
am
leading
you
?
''
said
the
countess
,
without
*NL*
replying
to
the
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
madame
,
''
replied
Monte
Cristo
;
``
but
you
see
I
make
no
resistance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
going
to
the
greenhouse
that
you
see
at
the
other
end
of
the
*NL*
grove

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
count
looked
at
Mercedes
as
if
to
interrogate
her
,
but
she
continued
*NL*
to
walk
on
in
silence
,
and
he
refrained
from
speaking
.
They
reached
*NL*
the
building
,
ornamented
with
magnificent
fruits
,
which
ripen
at
the
*NL*
beginning
of
July
in
the
artificial
temperature
which
takes
the
place
of
*NL*
the
sun
,
so
frequently
absent
in
our
climate
.
The
countess
left
the
arm
*NL*
of
Monte
Cristo
,
and
gathered
a
bunch
of
Muscatel
grapes
.
``
See
,
count
,
''
*NL*
she
said
,
with
a
smile
so
sad
in
its
expression
that
one
could
almost
*NL*
detect
the
tears
on
her
eyelids
--
``
see
,
our
French
grapes
are
not
to
be
*NL*
compared
,
I
know
,
with
yours
of
Sicily
and
Cyprus
,
but
you
will
make
*NL*
allowance
for
our
northern
sun
.
''
The
count
bowed
,
but
stepped
back
.
*NL*
``
Do
you
refuse
?
''
said
Mercedes
,
in
a
tremulous
voice
.
``
Pray
excuse
me
,
*NL*
madame
,
''
replied
Monte
Cristo
,
``
but
I
never
eat
Muscatel
grapes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mercedes
let
them
fall
,
and
sighed
.
A
magnificent
peach
was
hanging
*NL*
against
an
adjoining
wall
,
ripened
by
the
same
artificial
heat
.
Mercedes
*NL*
drew
near
,
and
plucked
the
fruit
.
``
Take
this
peach
,
then
,
''
she
said
.
The
*NL*
count
again
refused
.
``
What
,
again
?
''
she
exclaimed
,
in
so
plaintive
an
*NL*
accent
that
it
seemed
to
stifle
a
sob
;
``
really
,
you
pain
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
long
silence
followed
;
the
peach
,
like
the
grapes
,
fell
to
the
*NL*
ground
.
``
Count
,
''
added
Mercedes
with
a
supplicating
glance
,
``
there
is
a
*NL*
beautiful
Arabian
custom
,
which
makes
eternal
friends
of
those
who
have
*NL*
together
eaten
bread
and
salt
under
the
same
roof
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
it
,
madame
,
''
replied
the
count
;
``
but
we
are
in
France
,
and
not
*NL*
in
Arabia
,
and
in
France
eternal
friendships
are
as
rare
as
the
custom
*NL*
of
dividing
bread
and
salt
with
one
another
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
''
said
the
countess
,
breathlessly
,
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
Monte
*NL*
Cristo
,
whose
arm
she
convulsively
pressed
with
both
hands
,
``
we
are
*NL*
friends
,
are
we
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
count
became
pale
as
death
,
the
blood
rushed
to
his
heart
,
and
then
*NL*
again
rising
,
dyed
his
cheeks
with
crimson
;
his
eyes
swam
like
those
of
*NL*
a
man
suddenly
dazzled
.
``
Certainly
,
we
are
friends
,
''
he
replied
;
``
why
*NL*
should
we
not
be
?
''
The
answer
was
so
little
like
the
one
Mercedes
*NL*
desired
,
that
she
turned
away
to
give
vent
to
a
sigh
,
which
sounded
more
*NL*
like
a
groan
.
``
Thank
you
,
''
she
said
.
And
they
walked
on
again
.
They
went
*NL*
the
whole
length
of
the
garden
without
uttering
a
word
.
``
Sir
,
''
suddenly
*NL*
exclaimed
the
countess
,
after
their
walk
had
continued
ten
minutes
in
*NL*
silence
,
``
is
it
true
that
you
have
seen
so
much

travelled

suffered

deeply

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have

answered
Monte

*NL*
``
But
now
you
are
happy

*NL*
*NL*
``
Doubtless

replied
the

``

no

hears
me
complain

``
And
your

has
it
softened
your

*NL*
*NL*
``
My

equals
my
past
misery

said
the
count
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are

not
married

''
asked
the
countess
.
``

exclaimed
Monte

Cristo
,
shuddering
;
``
who
could
have
told
you
so

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

lovely
woman

*NL*
``
She
is

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
not

madame

At
Malta

I
loved
a
young
girl

was
on
the
*NL*
point
of
marrying
her
,
when
war
came
and
carried
me
away

I
thought
she
*NL*
loved
me
well
enough
to
wait
for
me
,
and
even
to
remain
faithful
to
my
*NL*
memory
.
When
I
returned
she
was
married
.
This
is
the
history
of
most
men
*NL*
who
have
passed
twenty
years
of
age
.
Perhaps
my
heart
was
weaker
than
*NL*
the
hearts
of
most
men
,
and
I
suffered
more
than
they
would
have
done
in
*NL*
my
place
;
that
is
all
.
''
The
countess
stopped
for
a
moment
,
as
if
gasping
*NL*
for
breath
.
``
Yes
,
''
she
said
,
``
and
you
have
still
preserved
this
love
in
*NL*
your
heart

can
only

ever
see
her
again

``
I

Not

The
countess
placed
herself
*NL*
before
Monte
Cristo
,
still
holding
in
her
hand
a
portion
of
the
perfumed
*NL*
grapes
.
``
Take
some
,

she
said
.
``
Madame

I
never
eat
Muscatel

*NL*
replied
Monte

,
as
if
the
subject
had
not
been
mentioned
before

*NL*
The
countess
dashed
the
grapes
into
the
nearest
thicket
,
with
a
gesture
*NL*
of
despair
.
``
Inflexible
man

she
murmured
.
Monte
Cristo
remained
as
*NL*
unmoved
as
if
the
reproach
had
not
been
addressed
to
him

Albert
at

this
moment
ran
in

``
Oh

he
exclaimed

``
What

asked
the
countess
,
as
though
awakening
from
*NL*
a
sleep
to
the
realities
of
life
;
``
did
you
say
a
misfortune

Indeed

I

``
Why
so

``
Because

bringing

death

which
took
place
on
the
first
stage
*NL*
after
he
left
Marseilles

Madame

Villefort
,
who
was
in
very
good

would
neither
believe

think

misfortune

*NL*
Mademoiselle
Valentine
,
at
the
first
words

guessed
the
whole

notwithstanding
all

And
she
took
two
or
three
steps
forward
.
*NL*
Monte

watched
her
with
an
air
so
thoughtful
,
and
so
full
of

affectionate
admiration
,
that
she
turned
back
and
grasped
his
hand

at

the

she
seized

joined

together

The
countess
left
with
an
*NL*
indescribable
pang
in
her
heart
,
and
before
she
had
taken
ten
steps
the
*NL*
count
saw
her
raise
her
handkerchief
to
her
eyes

``
Do
not

asked
Albert

astonished

They
re-entered
the
drawing-room
,
which
Valentine
and
*NL*
Madame
de
Villefort
had
just
quitted

It
is
perhaps
needless

Madame

*NL*
A
gloomy
scene
had
indeed
just
passed
at
the
house
of
M.
de
Villefort
.
*NL*
After
the
ladies
had
departed
for
the
ball
,
whither
all
the
entreaties
*NL*
of
Madame
de
Villefort
had
failed
in
persuading
him
to
accompany
them
,
*NL*
the
procureur
had
shut
himself
up
in
his
study
,
according
to
his
custom
,
*NL*
with
a
heap
of
papers
calculated
to
alarm
any
one
else
,
but
which
*NL*
generally
scarcely
satisfied
his
inordinate
desires
.
But
this
time
the
*NL*
papers
were
a
mere
matter
of
form
.
Villefort
had
secluded
himself
,
not
*NL*
to
study
,
but
to
reflect
;
and
with
the
door
locked
and
orders
given
that
*NL*
he
should
not
be
disturbed
excepting
for
important
business
,
he
sat
down
*NL*
in
his
arm-chair
and
began
to
ponder
over
the
events
,
the
remembrance
of
*NL*
which
had
during
the
last
eight
days
filled
his
mind
with
so
many
gloomy
*NL*
thoughts
and
bitter
recollections
.
Then
,
instead
of
plunging
into
the
*NL*
mass
of
documents
piled
before
him
,
he
opened
the
drawer
of
his
desk
,
*NL*
touched
a
spring
,
and
drew
out
a
parcel
of
cherished
memoranda
,
amongst
*NL*
which
he
had
carefully
arranged
,
in
characters
only
known
to
himself
,
*NL*
the
names
of
all
those
who
,
either
in
his
political
career
,
in
money
*NL*
matters
,
at
the
bar
,
or
in
his
mysterious
love
affairs
,
had
become
his
*NL*
enemies
.
*NL*
*NL*
Their
number
was
formidable
,
now
that
he
had
begun
to
fear
,
and
yet
*NL*
these
names
,
powerful
though
they
were
,
had
often
caused
him
to
smile
*NL*
with
the
same
kind
of
satisfaction
experienced
by
a
traveller
who
from
*NL*
the
summit
of
a
mountain
beholds
at
his
feet
the
craggy
eminences
,
the
*NL*
almost
impassable
paths
,
and
the
fearful
chasms
,
through
which
he
has
so
*NL*
perilously
climbed
.
When
he
had
run
over
all
these
names
in
his
memory
,
*NL*
again
read
and
studied
them
,
commenting
meanwhile
upon
his
lists
,
he
*NL*
shook
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
he
murmured
,
``
none
of
my
enemies
would
have
waited
so
patiently
*NL*
and
laboriously
for
so
long
a
space
of
time
,
that
they
might
now
come
*NL*
and
crush
me
with
this
secret
.
Sometimes
,
as
Hamlet
says
--
*NL*
*NL*
`
Foul
deeds
will
rise
,
*NL*
Tho
'
all
the
earth
o'erwhelm
them
to
men
's
eyes
;
'
*NL*
*NL*
but
,
like
a
phosphoric
light
,
they
rise
but
to
mislead
.
The
story
has
*NL*
been
told
by
the
Corsican
to
some
priest
,
who
in
his
turn
has
repeated
*NL*
it
.
M.
de
Monte
Cristo
may
have
heard
it
,
and
to
enlighten
himself
--
but
*NL*
why
should
he
wish
to
enlighten
himself
upon
the
subject
?
''
asked
*NL*
Villefort
,
after
a
moment
's
reflection
,
``
what
interest
can
this
M.
de
*NL*
Monte
Cristo
or
M.
Zaccone
,
--
son
of
a
shipowner
of
Malta
,
discoverer
*NL*
of
a
mine
in
Thessaly
,
now
visiting
Paris
for
the
first
time
,
--
what
*NL*
interest
,
I
say
,
can
he
take
in
discovering
a
gloomy
,
mysterious
,
and
*NL*
useless
fact
like
this
?
However
,
among
all
the
incoherent
details
given
*NL*
to
me
by
the
Abbe
Busoni
and
by
Lord
Wilmore
,
by
that
friend
and
that
*NL*
enemy
,
one
thing
appears
certain
and
clear
in
my
opinion
--
that
in
*NL*
no
period
,
in
no
case
,
in
no
circumstance
,
could
there
have
been
any
*NL*
contact
between
him
and
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Villefort
uttered
words
which
even
he
himself
did
not
believe
.
He
*NL*
dreaded
not
so
much
the
revelation
,
for
he
could
reply
to
or
deny
its
*NL*
truth
;
--
he
cared
little
for
that
mene
,
tekel
,
upharsin
,
which
appeared
*NL*
suddenly
in
letters
of
blood
upon
the
wall
;
--
but
what
he
was
really
*NL*
anxious
for
was
to
discover
whose
hand
had
traced
them
.
While
he
*NL*
was
endeavoring
to
calm
his
fears
,
--
and
instead
of
dwelling
upon
the
*NL*
political
future
that
had
so
often
been
the
subject
of
his
ambitious
*NL*
dreams
,
was
imagining
a
future
limited
to
the
enjoyments
of
home
,
in
*NL*
fear
of
awakening
the
enemy
that
had
so
long
slept
,
--
the
noise
of
a
*NL*
carriage
sounded
in
the
yard
,
then
he
heard
the
steps
of
an
aged
person
*NL*
ascending
the
stairs
,
followed
by
tears
and
lamentations
,
such
as
*NL*
servants
always
give
vent
to
when
they
wish
to
appear
interested
in
*NL*
their
master
's
grief
.
He
drew
back
the
bolt
of
his
door
,
and
almost
*NL*
directly
an
old
lady
entered
,
unannounced
,
carrying
her
shawl
on
her
*NL*
arm
,
and
her
bonnet
in
her
hand
.
The
white
hair
was
thrown
back
from
her
*NL*
yellow
forehead
,
and
her
eyes
,
already
sunken
by
the
furrows
of
age
,
now
*NL*
almost
disappeared
beneath
the
eyelids
swollen
with
grief
.
``
Oh
,
sir
,
''
*NL*
she
said
;
``
oh
,
sir
,
what
a
misfortune
!
I
shall
die
of
it
;
oh
,
yes
,
I
*NL*
shall
certainly
die
of
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
,
falling
upon
the
chair
nearest
the
door
,
she
burst
into
a
*NL*
paroxysm
of
sobs
.
The
servants
,
standing
in
the
doorway
,
not
daring
to
*NL*
approach
nearer
,
were
looking
at
Noirtier
's
old
servant
,
who
had
heard
*NL*
the
noise
from
his
master
's
room
,
and
run
there
also
,
remaining
behind
*NL*
the
others
.
Villefort
rose
,
and
ran
towards
his
mother-in-law
,
for
it
*NL*
was
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
what
can
have
happened
?
''
he
exclaimed
,
``
what
has
thus
disturbed
*NL*
you
?
Is
M.
de
Saint-Meran
with
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
M.
de
Saint-Meran
is
dead
,
''
answered
the
old
marchioness
,
without
*NL*
preface
and
without
expression
;
she
appeared
to
be
stupefied
.
Villefort
*NL*
drew
back
,
and
clasping
his
hands
together
,
exclaimed
--
``
Dead
!
--
so
*NL*
suddenly
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
week
ago
,
''
continued
Madame
de
Saint-Meran
,
``
we
went
out
together
in
*NL*
the
carriage
after
dinner
.
M.
de
Saint-Meran
had
been
unwell
for
some
*NL*
days
;
still
,
the
idea
of
seeing
our
dear
Valentine
again
inspired
him
*NL*
with
courage
,
and
notwithstanding
his
illness
he
would
leave
.
At
six
*NL*
leagues
from
Marseilles
,
after
having
eaten
some
of
the
lozenges
he
is
*NL*
accustomed
to
take
,
he
fell
into
such
a
deep
sleep
,
that
it
appeared
to
*NL*
me
unnatural
;
still
I
hesitated
to
wake
him
,
although
I
fancied
that
*NL*
his
face
was
flushed
,
and
that
the
veins
of
his
temples
throbbed
more
*NL*
violently
than
usual
.
However
,
as
it
became
dark
,
and
I
could
no
longer
*NL*
see
,
I
fell
asleep
;
I
was
soon
aroused
by
a
piercing
shriek
,
as
from
*NL*
a
person
suffering
in
his
dreams
,
and
he
suddenly
threw
his
head
back
*NL*
violently
.
I
called
the
valet
,
I
stopped
the
postilion
,
I
spoke
to
M.
*NL*
de
Saint-Meran
,
I
applied
my
smelling-salts
;
but
all
was
over
,
and
I
*NL*
arrived
at
Aix
by
the
side
of
a
corpse
.
''
Villefort
stood
with
his
mouth
*NL*
half
open
,
quite
stupefied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
you
sent
for
a
doctor
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Immediately
;
but
,
as
I
have
told
you
,
it
was
too
late
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
but
then
he
could
tell
of
what
complaint
the
poor
marquis
had
*NL*
died
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
sir
,
he
told
me
;
it
appears
to
have
been
an
apoplectic
*NL*
stroke
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
did
you
do
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
M.
de
Saint-Meran
had
always
expressed
a
desire
,
in
case
his
death
*NL*
happened
during
his
absence
from
Paris
,
that
his
body
might
be
brought
*NL*
to
the
family
vault
.
I
had
him
put
into
a
leaden
coffin
,
and
I
am
*NL*
preceding
him
by
a
few
days
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
poor
mother
,
''
said
Villefort
,
``
to
have
such
duties
to
perform
at
*NL*
your
age
after
such
a
blow
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
has
supported
me
through
all
;
and
then
,
my
dear
marquis
,
he
would
*NL*
certainly
have
done
everything
for
me
that
I
performed
for
him
.
It
is
*NL*
true
that
since
I
left
him
,
I
seem
to
have
lost
my
senses
.
I
can
not
cry
;
*NL*
at
my
age
they
say
that
we
have
no
more
tears
,
--
still
I
think
that
*NL*
when
one
is
in
trouble
one
should
have
the
power
of
weeping
.
Where
*NL*
is
Valentine
,
sir
?
It
is
on
her
account
I
am
here
;
I
wish
to
see
*NL*
Valentine
.
''
Villefort
thought
it
would
be
terrible
to
reply
that
*NL*
Valentine
was
at
a
ball
;
so
he
only
said
that
she
had
gone
out
with
her
*NL*
step-mother
,
and
that
she
should
be
fetched
.
``
This
instant
,
sir
--
this
*NL*
instant
,
I
beseech
you
!
''
said
the
old
lady
.
Villefort
placed
the
arm
*NL*
of
Madame
de
Saint-Meran
within
his
own
,
and
conducted
her
to
his
*NL*
apartment
.
``
Rest
yourself
,
mother
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
marchioness
raised
her
head
at
this
word
,
and
beholding
the
man
who
*NL*
so
forcibly
reminded
her
of
her
deeply-regretted
child
,
who
still
*NL*
lived
for
her
in
Valentine
,
she
felt
touched
at
the
name
of
mother
,
and
*NL*
bursting
into
tears
,
she
fell
on
her
knees
before
an
arm-chair
,
where
*NL*
she
buried
her
venerable
head
.
Villefort
left
her
to
the
care
of
the
*NL*
women
,
while
old
Barrois
ran
,
half-scared
,
to
his
master
;
for
nothing
*NL*
frightens
old
people
so
much
as
when
death
relaxes
its
vigilance
over
*NL*
them
for
a
moment
in
order
to
strike
some
other
old
person
.
Then
,
*NL*
while
Madame
de
Saint-Meran
remained
on
her
knees
,
praying
fervently
,
*NL*
Villefort
sent
for
a
cab
,
and
went
himself
to
fetch
his
wife
and
*NL*
daughter
from
Madame
de
Morcerf
's
.
He
was
so
pale
when
he
appeared
at
*NL*
the
door
of
the
ball-room
,
that
Valentine
ran
to
him
,
saying
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
father
,
some
misfortune
has
happened
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
grandmamma
has
just
arrived
,
Valentine
,
''
said
M.
de
Villefort
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
grandpapa
?
''
inquired
the
young
girl
,
trembling
with
apprehension
.
*NL*
M.
de
Villefort
only
replied
by
offering
his
arm
to
his
daughter
.
It
was
*NL*
just
in
time
,
for
Valentine
's
head
swam
,
and
she
staggered
;
Madame
de
*NL*
Villefort
instantly
hastened
to
her
assistance
,
and
aided
her
husband
in
*NL*
dragging
her
to
the
carriage
,
saying
--
``
What
a
singular
event
!
Who
could
*NL*
have
thought
it
?
Ah
,
yes
,
it
is
indeed
strange
!
''
And
the
wretched
*NL*
family
departed
,
leaving
a
cloud
of
sadness
hanging
over
the
rest
of
*NL*
the
evening
.
At
the
foot
of
the
stairs
,
Valentine
found
Barrois
awaiting
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
M.
Noirtier
wishes
to
see
you
to-night
,
he
said
,
in
an
undertone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
him
I
will
come
when
I
leave
my
dear
grandmamma
,
''
she
replied
,
*NL*
feeling
,
with
true
delicacy
,
that
the
person
to
whom
she
could
be
of
the
*NL*
most
service
just
then
was
Madame
de
Saint-Meran
.
Valentine
found
her
*NL*
grandmother
in
bed
;
silent
caresses
,
heartwrung
sobs
,
broken
sighs
,
*NL*
burning
tears
,
were
all
that
passed
in
this
sad
interview
,
while
Madame
*NL*
de
Villefort
,
leaning
on
her
husband
's
arm
,
maintained
all
outward
forms
*NL*
of
respect
,
at
least
towards
the
poor
widow
.
She
soon
whispered
to
*NL*
her
husband
,
``
I
think
it
would
be
better
for
me
to
retire
,
with
*NL*
your
permission
,
for
the
sight
of
me
appears
still
to
afflict
your
*NL*
mother-in-law
.
''
Madame
de
Saint-Meran
heard
her
.
``
Yes
,
yes
,
''
she
*NL*
said
softly
to
Valentine
,
``
let
her
leave
;
but
do
you
stay
.
''
Madame
de
*NL*
Villefort
left
,
and
Valentine
remained
alone
beside
the
bed
,
for
the
*NL*
procureur
,
overcome
with
astonishment
at
the
unexpected
death
,
had
*NL*
followed
his
wife
.
Meanwhile
,
Barrois
had
returned
for
the
first
time
to
*NL*
old
Noirtier
,
who
having
heard
the
noise
in
the
house
,
had
,
as
we
have
*NL*
said
,
sent
his
old
servant
to
inquire
the
cause
;
on
his
return
,
his
*NL*
quick
intelligent
eye
interrogated
the
messenger
.
``
Alas
,
sir
,
''
exclaimed
*NL*
Barrois
,
``
a
great
misfortune
has
happened
.
Madame
de
Saint-Meran
has
*NL*
arrived
,
and
her
husband
is
dead
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
de
Saint-Meran
and
Noirtier
had
never
been
on
strict
terms
of
*NL*
friendship
;
still
,
the
death
of
one
old
man
always
considerably
*NL*
affects
another
.
Noirtier
let
his
head
fall
upon
his
chest
,
apparently
*NL*
overwhelmed
and
thoughtful
;
then
he
closed
one
eye
,
in
token
of
inquiry
.
*NL*
``
Mademoiselle
Valentine
?
''
Noirtier
nodded
his
head
.
``
She
is
at
the
*NL*
ball
,
as
you
know
,
since
she
came
to
say
good-by
to
you
in
full
dress
.
''
*NL*
Noirtier
again
closed
his
left
eye
.
``
Do
you
wish
to
see
her
?
''
Noirtier
*NL*
again
made
an
affirmative
sign
.
``
Well
,
they
have
gone
to
fetch
her
,
no
*NL*
doubt
,
from
Madame
de
Morcerf
's
;
I
will
await
her
return
,
and
beg
her
to
*NL*
come
up
here
.
Is
that
what
you
wish
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
replied
the
invalid
.
*NL*
*NL*
Barrois
,
therefore
,
as
we
have
seen
,
watched
for
Valentine
,
and
informed
*NL*
her
of
her
grandfather
's
wish
.
Consequently
,
Valentine
came
up
to
*NL*
Noirtier
,
on
leaving
Madame
de
Saint-Meran
,
who
in
the
midst
of
her
*NL*
grief
had
at
last
yielded
to
fatigue
and
fallen
into
a
feverish
sleep
.
*NL*
Within
reach
of
her
hand
they
placed
a
small
table
upon
which
stood
a
*NL*
bottle
of
orangeade
,
her
usual
beverage
,
and
a
glass
.
Then
,
as
we
have
*NL*
said
,
the
young
girl
left
the
bedside
to
see
M.
Noirtier
.
Valentine
*NL*
kissed
the
old
man
,
who
looked
at
her
with
such
tenderness
that
her
eyes
*NL*
again
filled
with
tears
,
whose
sources
he
thought
must
be
exhausted
.
*NL*
The
old
gentleman
continued
to
dwell
upon
her
with
the
same
expression
.
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
''
said
Valentine
,
``
you
mean
that
I
have
yet
a
kind
grandfather
*NL*
left
,
do
you
not
.
''
The
old
man
intimated
that
such
was
his
meaning
.
*NL*
``
Ah
,
yes
,
happily
I
have
,
''
replied
Valentine
.
``
Without
that
,
what
would
*NL*
become
of
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
one
o'clock
in
the
morning
.
Barrois
,
who
wished
to
go
to
bed
*NL*
himself
,
observed
that
after
such
sad
events
every
one
stood
in
need
of
*NL*
rest
.
Noirtier
would
not
say
that
the
only
rest
he
needed
was
to
see
*NL*
his
child
,
but
wished
her
good-night
,
for
grief
and
fatigue
had
made
her
*NL*
appear
quite
ill
.
The
next
morning
she
found
her
grandmother
in
bed
;
*NL*
the
fever
had
not
abated
,
on
the
contrary
her
eyes
glistened
and
she
*NL*
appeared
to
be
suffering
from
violent
nervous
irritability
.
``
Oh
,
dear
*NL*
grandmamma
,
are
you
worse
?
''
exclaimed
Valentine
,
perceiving
all
these
*NL*
signs
of
agitation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
my
child
,
no
,
''
said
Madame
de
Saint-Meran
;
``
but
I
was
impatiently
*NL*
waiting
for
your
arrival
,
that
I
might
send
for
your
father
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
father
?
''
inquired
Valentine
,
uneasily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
wish
to
speak
to
him
.
''
Valentine
durst
not
oppose
her
*NL*
grandmother
's
wish
,
the
cause
of
which
she
did
not
know
,
and
an
instant
*NL*
afterwards
Villefort
entered
.
``
Sir
,
''
said
Madame
de
Saint-Meran
,
without
*NL*
using
any
circumlocution
,
and
as
if
fearing
she
had
no
time
to
lose
,
*NL*
``
you
wrote
to
me
concerning
the
marriage
of
this
child
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
madame
,
''
replied
Villefort
,
``
it
is
not
only
projected
but
*NL*
arranged
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
intended
son-in-law
is
named
M.
Franz
d'Epinay
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
madame
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
he
not
the
son
of
General
d'Epinay

was
on
our
side

who
was
*NL*
assassinated
some
days
before
the
usurper
returned
from
the
Island
of
*NL*
Elba
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
same
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
he
not
dislike
the
idea
of
marrying
the
granddaughter
of
a
*NL*
Jacobin
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Our
civil
dissensions
are
now
happily
extinguished

mother
,
''
said
*NL*
Villefort
;
``
M.
d'Epinay
was
quite
a
child
when
his
father
died
,
he
knows
*NL*
very
little
of
M.
Noirtier
,
and
will
meet
him
,
if
not
with
pleasure
,
at
*NL*
least
with
indifference
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
a
suitable
match
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
every
respect

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
the
young
man
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
regarded
with
universal

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
approve

him

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
one
of
the
most
well-bred
young
men
I
know

''
During
the
whole
*NL*
of
this
conversation
Valentine
had
remained
silent
.
``
Well
,
sir
,
''
said
*NL*
Madame
de
Saint-Meran
,
after
a
few
minutes
'
reflection
,
``
I
must
hasten
*NL*
the
marriage
,
for
I
have
but
a
short
time
to
live
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
,
madame
?
''
``
You
,
dear
mamma
?
''
exclaimed
M.
de
Villefort
and
*NL*
Valentine
at
the
same
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
what
I
am
saying
,
''
continued
the
marchioness
;
``
I
must
hurry
you
,
*NL*
so
that
,
as
she
has
no
mother
,
she
may
at
least
have
a
grandmother
to
*NL*
bless
her
marriage
.
I
am
all
that
is
left
to
her
belonging
to
my
poor
*NL*
Renee
,
whom
you
have
so
soon
forgotten
,
sir

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
madame
,
''
said
Villefort
,
``
you
forget
that
I
was
obliged
to
give
a
*NL*
mother
to
my
child

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
stepmother
is
never
a
mother

But
this
is
not
to
the
*NL*
purpose
,
--
our
business
concerns
Valentine
,
let
us
leave
the
dead
in
*NL*
peace
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
was
said
with
such
exceeding
rapidity
,
that
there
was
something
*NL*
in
the
conversation
that
seemed
like
the
beginning
of
delirium
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
shall
be
as
you
wish
,
madame
,
''
said
Villefort
;
``
more
especially
*NL*
since
your
wishes
coincide
with
mine

and
as
soon

M.

arrives
*NL*
in
Paris

--
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
grandmother
,
''
interrupted
Valentine
,
``
consider
decorum
--
the
*NL*
recent
death
.
You
would
not
have
me
marry
under
such
sad
auspices
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
child
,
''
exclaimed
the
old
lady
sharply
,
``
let
us
hear
none
of
the
*NL*
conventional
objections
that
deter
weak
minds
from
preparing
for
the
*NL*
future

I
also
was
married
at
the
death-bed
of
my
mother
,
and
certainly
*NL*
I
have
not
been
less
happy
on
that
account
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Still
that
idea
of
death
,
madame

said
Villefort
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Still
?

Always
!
I
tell
you
I
am
going
to
die

do
you
understand
?
Well
,
*NL*
before
dying
,
I
wish
to
see
my
son-in-law
.
I
wish
to
tell
him
to
make
*NL*
my
child
happy
;
I
wish
to
read
in
his
eyes
whether
he
intends
to
obey
*NL*
me
;
--
in
fact
,
I
will
know
him
--
I
will
!
''
continued
the
old
lady
,
with
a
*NL*
fearful
expression
,
``
that
I
may
rise
from
the
depths
of
my
grave
to
find
*NL*
him
,
if
he
should
not
fulfil
his
duty
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madame
,
''
said
Villefort
,
``
you
must
lay
aside
these
exalted
ideas

*NL*
almost
assume
the
appearance

madness

buried
in

rise
no
more

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
tell
you
,
sir

that
you
are
mistaken

This
night
I
have
had
a
*NL*
fearful
sleep
.
It
seemed
as
though
my
soul
were
already
hovering
over
my
*NL*
body
,
my
eyes
,
which
I
tried
to
open
,
closed
against
my
will

and
what
*NL*
will
appear
impossible
above
all
to
you

I
saw
,
with
my
eyes
shut
,
*NL*
in
the
spot
where
you
are
now
standing
,
issuing
from
that
corner
where
*NL*
there
is
a
door
leading
into
Madame
Villefort
's
dressing-room
--
I
saw
,
I
*NL*
tell
you
,
silently
enter
,
a
white
figure
.
''
Valentine
screamed
.
``
It
was
*NL*
the
fever
that
disturbed
you
,
madame

''
said
Villefort
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Doubt
,
if
you
please
,
but
I
am
sure
of
what
I
say

I
saw
a
white
*NL*
figure
,
and
as
if
to
prevent
my
discrediting
the
testimony
of
only
one
*NL*
of
my
senses
,
I
heard
my
glass
removed
--
the
same
which
is
there
now
on
*NL*
the
table
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
dear
mother
,
it
was
a
dream

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
little
was
it
a
dream
,
that
I
stretched
my
hand
towards
the
bell
;
*NL*
but
when
I
did
so
,
the
shade
disappeared
;
my
maid
then
entered
with
a
*NL*
light
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
she
saw
no
one

*NL*
*NL*
``
Phantoms
are
visible
to
those
only

It

the

soul

Well
,
if
my

soul
can
come
to
me

not
my
soul
reappear
to
guard
my

tie
is
even

more
direct

it
seems
to
me

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

madame

said
Villefort
,
deeply
affected
,
in
spite
of
himself
,
``
do
*NL*
not
yield
to
those
gloomy
thoughts

you
will
long
live
with

happy

we
will
make
you
forget

*NL*
*NL*
``
Never

never

the
marchioness

When

soon

inform

must

expeditious

*NL*
And
then
I
also
wish
to
see
a
notary
,
that
I
may
be
assured
that
all
our
*NL*
property
returns
to
Valentine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
grandmamma
,
''
murmured
Valentine
,
pressing
her
lips
on
the
burning
*NL*
brow
,
``
do
you
wish
to
kill
me
?
Oh
,
how
feverish
you
are
;
we
must
not
*NL*
send
for
a
notary
,
but
for
a
doctor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
doctor
?
''
said
she
,
shrugging
her
shoulders
,
``
I
am
not
ill
;
I
am
*NL*
thirsty
--
that
is
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
drinking
,
dear
grandmamma
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
same
as
usual
,
my
dear
,
my
glass
is
there
on
the
table
--
give
it
to
*NL*
me
,
Valentine
.
''
Valentine
poured
the
orangeade
into
a
glass
and
gave
it
*NL*
to
her
grandmother
with
a
certain
degree
of
dread
,
for
it
was
the
same
*NL*
glass
she
fancied
that
had
been
touched
by
the
spectre
.
The
marchioness
*NL*
drained
the
glass
at
a
single
draught
,
and
then
turned
on
her
pillow
,
*NL*
repeating
,
--
``
The
notary
,
the
notary
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
de
Villefort
left
the
room
,
and
Valentine
seated
herself
at
the
*NL*
bedside
of
her
grandmother
.
The
poor
child
appeared
herself
to
require
*NL*
the
doctor
she
had
recommended
to
her
aged
relative
.
A
bright
spot
*NL*
burned
in
either
cheek
,
her
respiration
was
short
and
difficult
,
and
her
*NL*
pulse
beat
with
feverish
excitement
.
She
was
thinking
of
the
despair
*NL*
of
Maximilian
,
when
he
should
be
informed
that
Madame
de
Saint-Meran
,
*NL*
instead
of
being
an
ally
,
was
unconsciously
acting
as
his
enemy
.
More
*NL*
than
once
she
thought
of
revealing
all
to
her
grandmother
,
and
she
would
*NL*
not
have
hesitated
a
moment
,
if
Maximilian
Morrel
had
been
named
Albert
*NL*
de
Morcerf
or
Raoul
de
Chateau-Renaud
;
but
Morrel
was
of
plebeian
*NL*
extraction
,
and
Valentine
knew
how
the
haughty
Marquise
de
Saint-Meran
*NL*
despised
all
who
were
not
noble
.
Her
secret
had
each
time
been
repressed
*NL*
when
she
was
about
to
reveal
it
,
by
the
sad
conviction
that
it
would
be
*NL*
useless
to
do
so
;
for
,
were
it
once
discovered
by
her
father
and
mother
,
*NL*
all
would
be
lost
.
Two
hours
passed
thus
;
Madame
de
Saint-Meran
was
in
*NL*
a
feverish
sleep
,
and
the
notary
had
arrived
.
Though
his
coming
was
*NL*
announced
in
a
very
low
tone
,
Madame
de
Saint-Meran
arose
from
her
*NL*
pillow
.
``
The
notary
!
''
she
exclaimed
,
``
let
him
come
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
notary
,
who
was
at
the
door
,
immediately
entered
.
``
Go
,
Valentine
,
''
*NL*
said
Madame
de
Saint-Meran
,
``
and
leave
me
with
this
gentleman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
grandmamma
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Leave
me
--
go
!
''
The
young
girl
kissed
her
grandmother
,
and
left
with
her
*NL*
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
;
at
the
door
she
found
the
valet
de
chambre
,
*NL*
who
told
her
that
the
doctor
was
waiting
in
the
dining-room
.
Valentine
*NL*
instantly
ran
down
.
The
doctor
was
a
friend
of
the
family
,
and
at
*NL*
the
same
time
one
of
the
cleverest
men
of
the
day
,
and
very
fond
of
*NL*
Valentine
,
whose
birth
he
had
witnessed
.
He
had
himself
a
daughter
about
*NL*
her
age
,
but
whose
life
was
one
continued
source
of
anxiety
and
fear
to
*NL*
him
from
her
mother
having
been
consumptive
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
said
Valentine
,
``
we
have
been
waiting
for
you
with
such
*NL*
impatience
,
dear
M.
d'Avrigny
.
But
,
first
of
all
,
how
are
Madeleine
and
*NL*
Antoinette
?
''
Madeleine
was
the
daughter
of
M.
d'Avrigny
,
and
Antoinette
*NL*
his
niece
.
M.
d'Avrigny
smiled
sadly
.
``
Antoinette
is
very
well
,
''
he
*NL*
said
,
``
and
Madeleine
tolerably
so
.
But
you
sent
for
me

my
dear
child

*NL*
It
is
not
your
father
or
Madame
de
Villefort
who
is
ill
.
As
for
you
,
*NL*
although
we
doctors
can
not
divest
our
patients
of
nerves
,
I
fancy
you
*NL*
have
no
further
need
of
me
than
to
recommend
you
not
to
allow
your
*NL*
imagination
to
take
too
wide
a
field

''
Valentine
colored
.
M.
d'Avrigny
*NL*
carried
the
science
of
divination
almost
to
a
miraculous
extent
,
for
*NL*
he
was
one
of
the
physicians
who
always
work
upon
the
body
through
the
*NL*
mind
.
``
No
,
''
she
replied
,
``
it
is
for
my
poor
grandmother
.
You
know
the
*NL*
calamity
that
has
happened
to
us

do
you
not

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
nothing

said
M.
d'Avrigny
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas

said
Valentine
,
restraining
her
tears
,
``
my

*NL*

repeated
the
doctor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

that
she
must
go
and
join

d'Avrigny

*NL*
``

``

smiled
sadly

*NL*
*NL*
``
An

phantom
enter
her
chamber
and
even
*NL*
heard
the
noise
it
made
on
touching
her
glass
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
singular
,
''
said
the
doctor
;
``
I
was
not
aware
that
Madame
de
*NL*
Saint-Meran
was
subject
to
such
hallucinations
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
the
first
time
I
ever
saw
her
in
this
condition
,
''
said
Valentine
;
*NL*
``
and
this
morning
she
frightened
me
so
that
I
thought
her
mad
;
and
my
*NL*
father
,
who
you
know
is
a
strong-minded
man
,
himself
appeared
deeply
*NL*
impressed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
will
go
and
see
,
''
said
the
doctor
;
``
what
you
tell
me
seems
very
*NL*
strange
.
''
The
notary
here
descended
,
and
Valentine
was
informed
that
her
*NL*
grandmother
was
alone
.
``
Go
upstairs
,
''
she
said
to
the
doctor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
dare
not
--
she
forbade
my
sending
for
you
;
and
,
as
you
say
,
I
am
*NL*
myself
agitated
,
feverish
and
out
of
sorts
.
I
will
go
and
take
a
turn
in
*NL*
the
garden
to
recover
myself
.
''
The
doctor
pressed
Valentine
's
hand
,
and
*NL*
while
he
visited
her
grandmother
,
she
descended
the
steps
.
We
need
not
*NL*
say
which
portion
of
the
garden
was
her
favorite
walk
.
After
remaining
*NL*
for
a
short
time
in
the
parterre
surrounding
the
house
,
and
gathering
*NL*
a
rose
to
place
in
her
waist
or
hair
,
she
turned
into
the
dark
avenue
*NL*
which
led
to
the
bench
;
then
from
the
bench
she
went
to
the
gate
.
*NL*
As
usual
,
Valentine
strolled
for
a
short
time
among
her
flowers
,
but
*NL*
without
gathering
them
.
The
mourning
in
her
heart
forbade
her
assuming
*NL*
this
simple
ornament
,
though
she
had
not
yet
had
time
to
put
on
the
*NL*
outward
semblance
of
woe
.
She
then
turned
towards
the
avenue
.
As
she
*NL*
advanced
she
fancied
she
heard
a
voice
speaking
her
name
.
She
stopped
*NL*
astonished
,
then
the
voice
reached
her
ear
more
distinctly
,
and
she
*NL*
recognized
it
to
be
that
of
Maximilian
.

Chapter
73
.
The
Promise
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
,
indeed
,
Maximilian
Morrel
,
who
had
passed
a
wretched
existence
*NL*
since
the
previous
day
.
With
the
instinct
peculiar
to
lovers
he
had
*NL*
anticipated
after
the
return
of
Madame
de
Saint-Meran
and
the
death
*NL*
of
the
marquis
,
that
something
would
occur
at
M.
de
Villefort
's
in
*NL*
connection
with
his
attachment
for
Valentine
.
His
presentiments
were
*NL*
realized
,
as
we
shall
see
,
and
his
uneasy
forebodings
had
goaded
him
*NL*
pale
and
trembling
to
the
gate
under
the
chestnut-trees
.
Valentine
was
*NL*
ignorant
of
the
cause
of
this
sorrow
and
anxiety
,
and
as
it
was
not
his
*NL*
accustomed
hour
for
visiting
her
,
she
had
gone
to
the
spot
simply
by
*NL*
accident
or
perhaps
through
sympathy
.
Morrel
called
her
,
and
she
ran
*NL*
to
the
gate
.
``
You
here
at
this
hour
?
''
said
she
.
``
Yes
,
my
poor
girl
,
''
*NL*
replied
Morrel
;
``
I
come
to
bring
and
to
hear
bad
tidings
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
,
indeed
,
a
house
of
mourning
,
''
said
Valentine
;
``
speak
,
*NL*
Maximilian
,
although
the
cup
of
sorrow
seems
already
full
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
Valentine
,
''
said
Morrel
,
endeavoring
to
conceal
his
own
emotion
,
*NL*
``
listen
,
I
entreat
you
;
what
I
am
about
to
say
is
very
serious
.
When
are
*NL*
you
to
be
married
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
tell
you
all
,
''
said
Valentine
;
``
from
you
I
have
nothing
*NL*
to
conceal
.
This
morning
the
subject
was
introduced
,
and
my
dear
*NL*
grandmother
,
on
whom
I
depended
as
my
only
support
,
not
only
declared
*NL*
herself
favorable
to
it
,
but
is
so
anxious
for
it
,
that
they
only
await
*NL*
the
arrival
of
M.
d'Epinay
,
and
the
following
day
the
contract
will
*NL*
be
signed
.
''
A
deep
sigh
escaped
the
young
man
,
who
gazed
long
and
*NL*
mournfully
at
her
he
loved
.
``
Alas
,
''
replied
he
,
``
it
is
dreadful
thus
to
*NL*
hear
my
condemnation
from
your
own
lips
.
The
sentence
is
passed
,
and
,
in
*NL*
a
few
hours
,
will
be
executed
;
it
must
be
so
,
and
I
will
not
endeavor
*NL*
to
prevent
it
.
But
,
since
you
say
nothing
remains
but
for
M.
d'Epinay
to
*NL*
arrive
that
the
contract
may
be
signed
,
and
the
following
day
you
will
*NL*
be
his
,
to-morrow
you
will
be
engaged
to
M.
d'Epinay
,
for
he
came
this
*NL*
morning
to
Paris
.
''
Valentine
uttered
a
cry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
at
the
house
of
Monte
Cristo
an
hour
since
,
''
said
Morrel
;
``
we
*NL*
were
speaking
,
he
of
the
sorrow
your
family
had
experienced
,
and
I
of
*NL*
your
grief
,
when
a
carriage
rolled
into
the
court-yard
.
Never
,
till
*NL*
then
,
had
I
placed
any
confidence
in
presentiments
,
but
now
I
can
not
*NL*
help
believing
them
,
Valentine
.
At
the
sound
of
that
carriage
I
*NL*
shuddered
;
soon
I
heard
steps
on
the
staircase
,
which
terrified
me
as
*NL*
much
as
the
footsteps
of
the
commander
did
Don
Juan
.
The
door
at
last
*NL*
opened
;
Albert
de
Morcerf
entered
first
,
and
I
began
to
hope
my
fears
*NL*
were
vain
,
when
,
after
him
,
another
young
man
advanced
,
and
the
count
*NL*
exclaimed
--
`
Ah
,
here
is
the
Baron
Franz
d'Epinay
!
'
I
summoned
all
my
*NL*
strength
and
courage
to
my
support
.
Perhaps
I
turned
pale
and
trembled
,
*NL*
but
certainly
I
smiled
;
and
five
minutes
after
I
left
,
without
having
*NL*
heard
one
word
that
had
passed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
Maximilian
!
''
murmured
Valentine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Valentine
,
the
time
has
arrived
when
you
must
answer
me
.
And
remember
*NL*
my
life
depends
on
your
answer
.
What
do
you
intend
doing
?
''
Valentine
*NL*
held
down
her
head
;
she
was
overwhelmed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
,
''
said
Morrel
;
``
it
is
not
the
first
time
you
have
contemplated
*NL*
our
present
position
,
which
is
a
serious
and
urgent
one
;
I
do
not
think
*NL*
it
is
a
moment
to
give
way
to
useless
sorrow
;
leave
that
for
those
who
*NL*
like
to
suffer
at
their
leisure
and
indulge
their
grief
in
secret
.
There
*NL*
are
such
in
the
world
,
and
God
will
doubtless
reward
them
in
heaven
for
*NL*
their
resignation
on
earth
,
but
those
who
mean
to
contend
must
not
lose
*NL*
one
precious
moment
,
but
must
return
immediately
the
blow
which
fortune
*NL*
strikes
.
Do
you
intend
to
struggle
against
our
ill-fortune
?
Tell
me
,
*NL*
Valentine
for
it
is
that
I
came
to
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Valentine
trembled
,
and
looked
at
him
with
amazement
.
The
idea
of
*NL*
resisting
her
father
,
her
grandmother
,
and
all
the
family
,
had
never
*NL*
occurred
to
her
.
``
What
do
you
say
,
Maximilian
?
''
asked
Valentine
.
``
What
*NL*
do
you
mean
by
a
struggle
?
Oh
,
it
would
be
a
sacrilege
.
What
?
I
resist
*NL*
my
father
's
order
,
and
my
dying
grandmother
's
wish
?
Impossible
!
''
Morrel
*NL*
started
.
``
You
are
too
noble
not
to
understand
me
,
and
you
understand
me
*NL*
so
well
that
you
already
yield
,
dear
Maximilian
.
No
,
no
;
I
shall
need
*NL*
all
my
strength
to
struggle
with
myself
and
support
my
grief
in
secret
,
*NL*
as
you
say
.
But
to
grieve
my
father
--
to
disturb
my
grandmother
's
last
*NL*
moments
--
never
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
right

said
Morrel
,
calmly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
what
a
tone
you
speak
!

cried
Valentine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
speak
as
one
who
admires
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
Mademoiselle

cried
Valentine
;
``
mademoiselle

Oh

selfish
man

pretends

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
mistake

I
understand

perfectly

You

not
oppose

Villefort

the
marchioness

to-morrow
you

bind

*NL*
``

*NL*
``
Do

I
shall
be
a
bad
judge
in
such
a

case

my
selfishness
will
blind
me

replied
Morrel
,
whose
low
voice
and
*NL*
clinched
hands
announced
his
growing
desperation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
would
you
have
proposed

Maximilian

you
found
me
willing

It

not

*NL*
*NL*
``
Valentine

said
Morrel
pushing
aside
a
loose
plank
,
``
give
me
your
hand
*NL*
in
token

forgiveness

my
anger

the
last

the
most

passed
through

Valentine

raising
her
eyes
to
heaven
and
*NL*
sighing
.

I

free

replied
Maximilian
,
``

rich
enough

Morrel

retire

only
return

friends

reconciled

''
Valentine
shook
her
head
.
*NL*
``
I
feared

Maximilian

said
she
;
``
it
is
the
counsel

Impossible

impossible

You

``
Yes

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

Maximilian

you
prove
to

that
passion

blinds
the
most
well-meaning

I
appreciate
your
calm

It

then
understood
that
to-morrow
you
will
be
irrevocably
promised
to
*NL*
M.
Franz
d'Epinay

not

by
that
theatrical
formality
invented
to

heighten
the
effect
of
a
comedy
called
the
signature
of
the
contract

your
own
will
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Again
you
drive
me
to
despair

Valentine

``
again

plunge
the
dagger
into
the
wound

What
would
you

*NL*
sister
listened
to
such
a
proposition

*NL*
*NL*
``
Mademoiselle

''
replied
Morrel
with
a
bitter
smile
,
``
I
am
selfish
--
you
*NL*
have
already
said
so

and
as
a
selfish
man
I
think
not
of
what
others
*NL*
would
do
in
my
situation
,
but
of
what
I
intend
doing
myself
.
I
think
*NL*
only
that
I
have
known
you
not
a
whole
year
.
From
the
day
I
first
saw
*NL*
you
,
all
my
hopes
of
happiness
have
been
in
securing
your
affection
.
One
*NL*
day
you
acknowledged
that
you
loved
me
,
and
since
that
day
my
hope
of
*NL*
future
happiness
has
rested
on
obtaining
you
,
for
to
gain
you
would
be
*NL*
life
to
me

Now
,
I
think
no
more
;
I
say
only
that
fortune
has
turned
*NL*
against
me
--
I
had
thought
to
gain
heaven
,
and
now
I
have
lost
it

It
is
*NL*
an
every-day
occurrence
for
a
gambler
to
lose
not
only
what
he
possesses
*NL*
but
also
what
he
has
not

''
Morrel
pronounced
these
words
with
perfect
*NL*
calmness
;
Valentine
looked
at
him
a
moment
with
her
large
,
scrutinizing
*NL*
eyes
,
endeavoring
not
to
let
Morrel
discover
the
grief
which
struggled
*NL*
in
her
heart
.
``
But
,
in
a
word
,
what
are
you
going
to
do
?

asked
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
going
to
have
the
honor

taking
my
leave

you

solemnly
assuring
you
that
I
wish
your

calm

fully
occupied

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

Valentine

*NL*
*NL*

Adieu

Morrel

bowing

*NL*
*NL*

cried
the
young
girl
,
extending
her
hand
through
*NL*
the
opening
,
and
seizing
Maximilian
by
his
coat
,
for
she
understood
from
*NL*
her
own
agitated
feelings
that
her

calmness
could
not
be
real

me
what
you
are
going
to
do
,
Maximilian

''
The
*NL*
young
man
smiled
sorrowfully
.
``
Speak
,
speak
!
''
said
Valentine
;
``
I
entreat
*NL*
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
your
resolution
changed
,
Valentine
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
can
not
change
,
unhappy
man
;
you
know
it
must
not
!
''
cried
the
young
*NL*
girl
.
``
Then
adieu
,
Valentine
!
''
Valentine
shook
the
gate
with
a
strength
*NL*
of
which
she
could
not
have
been
supposed
to
be
possessed
,
as
Morrel
was
*NL*
going
away
,
and
passing
both
her
hands
through
the
opening
,
she
clasped
*NL*
and
wrung
them
.
``
I
must
know
what
you
mean
to
do
!
''
said
she
.
``
Where
are
*NL*
you
going
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
fear
not
,
''
said
Maximilian
,
stopping
at
a
short
distance
,
``
I
do
not
*NL*
intend
to
render
another
man
responsible
for
the
rigorous
fate
reserved
*NL*
for
me
.
Another
might
threaten
to
seek
M.
Franz
,
to
provoke
him
,
and
to
*NL*
fight
with
him
;
all
that
would
be
folly
.
What
has
M.
Franz
to
do
with
*NL*
it
?
He
saw
me
this
morning
for
the
first
time
,
and
has
already
forgotten
*NL*
he
has
seen
me
.
He
did
not
even
know
I
existed
when
it
was
arranged
by
*NL*
your
two
families
that
you
should
be
united
.
I
have
no
enmity
against
M.
*NL*
Franz
,
and
promise
you
the
punishment
shall
not
fall
on
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
whom
,
then
!
--
on
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
you
?
Valentine
!
Oh
,
heaven
forbid
!
Woman
is
sacred
;
the
woman
one
*NL*
loves
is
holy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
yourself
,
then
,
unhappy
man

on
yourself
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
the
only
guilty
person
,
am
I
not

''
said
Maximilian
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Maximilian
!
''
said
Valentine
,
``
Maximilian
,
come
back
,
I
entreat
you
!
''
He
*NL*
drew
near
with
his
sweet
smile
,
and
but
for
his
paleness
one
might
*NL*
have
thought
him
in
his
usual
happy
mood
.
``
Listen
,
my
dear
,
my
adored
*NL*
Valentine
,
''
said
he
in
his
melodious
and
grave
tone
;
``
those
who
,
like
*NL*
us
,
have
never
had
a
thought
for
which
we
need
blush
before
the
world
,
*NL*
such
may
read
each
other
's
hearts
.
I
never
was
romantic
,
and
am
no
*NL*
melancholy
hero
.
I
imitate
neither
Manfred
nor
Anthony
;
but
without
*NL*
words
,
protestations
,
or
vows
,
my
life
has
entwined
itself
with
yours
;
*NL*
you
leave
me
,
and
you
are
right
in
doing
so
,
--
I
repeat
it
,
you
are
*NL*
right
;
but
in
losing
you
,
I
lose
my
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
moment
you
leave
me
,
Valentine
,
I
am
alone
in
the
world
.
My
sister
*NL*
is
happily
married
;
her
husband
is
only
my
brother-in-law
,
that
is
,
a
*NL*
man
whom
the
ties
of
social
life
alone
attach
to
me
;
no
one
then
longer
*NL*
needs
my
useless
life
.
This
is
what
I
shall
do
;
I
will
wait
until
the
*NL*
very
moment
you
are
married
,
for
I
will
not
lose
the
shadow
of
one
of
*NL*
those
unexpected
chances
which
are
sometimes
reserved
for
us
,
since
M.
*NL*
Franz
may
,
after
all
,
die
before
that
time
,
a
thunderbolt
may
fall
even
*NL*
on
the
altar
as
you
approach
it
,
--
nothing
appears
impossible
to
one
*NL*
condemned
to
die
,
and
miracles
appear
quite
reasonable
when
his
escape
*NL*
from
death
is
concerned
.
I
will
,
then
,
wait
until
the
last
moment
,
*NL*
and
when
my
misery
is
certain
,
irremediable
,
hopeless
,
I
will
write
*NL*
a
confidential
letter
to
my
brother-in-law
,
another
to
the
prefect
of
*NL*
police
,
to
acquaint
them
with
my
intention
,
and
at
the
corner
of
some
*NL*
wood
,
on
the
brink
of
some
abyss
,
on
the
bank
of
some
river
,
I
will
put
*NL*
an
end
to
my
existence
,
as
certainly
as
I
am
the
son
of
the
most
honest
*NL*
man
who
ever
lived
in
France
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Valentine
trembled
convulsively
;
she
loosened
her
hold
of
the
gate
,
her
*NL*
arms
fell
by
her
side
,
and
two
large
tears
rolled
down
her
cheeks
.
The
*NL*
young
man
stood
before
her
,
sorrowful
and
resolute
.
``
Oh
,
for
pity
's
*NL*
sake
,
''
said
she
,
``
you
will
live
,
will
you
not

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

on
my
honor

''
said
Maximilian
;
``
but
that
will
not
affect
you

You
*NL*
have
done
your
duty

your
conscience
will
be
at
rest

''
Valentine
*NL*
fell
on
her
knees
,
and
pressed
her
almost
bursting
heart
.
``
Maximilian

``

Morrel

*NL*
``

raising
both

to

with
a

cried
she

willing

away
her
tears

and
resuming
her
firmness
,
``
I

resolved
not

Say

it
be

Speak

''
Morrel
,
who
had
already
*NL*
gone
some
few
steps
away
,
again
returned
,
and
pale
with
joy
extended
*NL*
both
hands
towards
Valentine
through
the
opening
.
``
Valentine

''
said
he
,
*NL*
``

Valentine

you

not
speak
thus

die

Why
*NL*
should
I
obtain
you
by
violence
,
if
our
love
is
mutual
?
Is
it
from
mere
*NL*
humanity
you
bid
me
live

I
would
then
rather
die

*NL*
*NL*
``
Truly

Valentine

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

Well

before

leave

*NL*
tell
him
all

he
shall
come

You

told

I
shall
very
soon
learn
that

at

easily
get
over

young

sorrowfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My

words

not

one
half

*NL*
Valentine
had
approached
,
or
rather
,
had
placed
her
lips
so
near
the
*NL*
fence
,
that
they
nearly
touched
those
of
Morrel
,
which
were
pressed
*NL*
against
the
other
side
of
the
cold
and
inexorable
barrier
.
``
Adieu

then
,
*NL*
till
we
meet
again

tearing
herself
away

``
I
shall
hear

from

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

*NL*
``
Thanks

thanks

dear
love

adieu

''
The
sound
of
a
kiss
was
heard
,
and
*NL*
Valentine
fled
through
the
avenue
.
Morrel
listened
to
catch
the
last
*NL*
sound
of
her
dress
brushing
the
branches
,
and
of
her
footstep
on
the
*NL*
gravel
,
then
raised
his
eyes
with
an
ineffable
smile
of
thankfulness
to
*NL*
heaven
for
being
permitted
to
be
thus
loved
,
and
then
also
disappeared
.
*NL*
The
young
man
returned
home
and
waited
all
the
evening
and
all
the
next
*NL*
day
without
getting
any
message
.
It
was
only
on
the
following
day
,
*NL*
at
about
ten
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
as
he
was
starting
to
call
on
M.
*NL*
Deschamps
,
the
notary
,
that
he
received
from
the
postman
a
small
billet
,
*NL*
which
he
knew
to
be
from
Valentine
,
although
he
had
not
before
seen
her
*NL*
writing
.
It
was
to
this
effect
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
Tears
,
entreaties
,
prayers
,
have
availed
me
nothing
.
Yesterday
,
for
*NL*
two
hours
,
I
was
at
the
church
of
Saint-Phillippe
du
Roule
,
and
for
two
*NL*
hours
I
prayed
most
fervently
.
Heaven
is
as
inflexible
as
man
,
and
the
*NL*
signature
of
the
contract
is
fixed
for
this
evening
at
nine
o'clock
.
I
*NL*
have
but
one
promise
and
but
one
heart
to
give
;
that
promise
is
pledged
*NL*
to
you
,
that
heart
is
also
yours
.
This
evening
,
then
,
at
a
quarter
to
*NL*
nine
at
the
gate
.
*NL*
*NL*
Your
betrothed
,
*NL*
*NL*
Valentine
de
Villefort
.
*NL*
*NL*
P.S.
--
My
poor
grandmother
gets
worse
and
worse
;
yesterday
her
fever
*NL*
amounted
to
delirium
;
to-day
her
delirium
is
almost
madness
.
You
will
*NL*
be
very
kind
to
me
,
will
you
not
,
Morrel
,
to
make
me
forget
my
sorrow
in
*NL*
leaving
her
thus
?
I
think
it
is
kept
a
secret
from
grandpapa
Noirtier
,
*NL*
that
the
contract
is
to
be
signed
this
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
Morrel
went
also
to
the
notary
,
who
confirmed
the
news
that
the
contract
*NL*
was
to
be
signed
that
evening
.
Then
he
went
to
call
on
Monte
Cristo
and
*NL*
heard
still
more
.
Franz
had
been
to
announce
the
ceremony
,
and
Madame
de
*NL*
Villefort
had
also
written
to
beg
the
count
to
excuse
her
not
inviting
*NL*
him
;
the
death
of
M.
de
Saint-Meran
and
the
dangerous
illness
of
his
*NL*
widow
would
cast
a
gloom
over
the
meeting
which
she
would
regret
should
*NL*
be
shared
by
the
count
whom
she
wished
every
happiness
.
The
day
before
*NL*
Franz
had
been
presented
to
Madame
de
Saint-Meran
,
who
had
left
her
bed
*NL*
to
receive
him
,
but
had
been
obliged
to
return
to
it
immediately
after
.
*NL*
It
is
easy
to
suppose
that
Morrel
's
agitation
would
not
escape
the
*NL*
count
's
penetrating
eye
.
Monte
Cristo
was
more
affectionate
than
*NL*
ever
,
--
indeed
,
his
manner
was
so
kind
that
several
times
Morrel
was
on
*NL*
the
point
of
telling
him
all
.
But
he
recalled
the
promise
he
had
made
to
*NL*
Valentine
,
and
kept
his
secret
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
read
Valentine
's
letter
twenty
times
in
the
course
of
the
*NL*
day
.
It
was
her
first
,
and
on
what
an
occasion
!
Each
time
he
read
it
he
*NL*
renewed
his
vow
to
make
her
happy
.
How
great
is
the
power
of
a
woman
who
*NL*
has
made
so
courageous
a
resolution
!
What
devotion
does
she
deserve
from
*NL*
him
for
whom
she
has
sacrificed
everything
!
How
ought
she
really
to
*NL*
be
supremely
loved
!
She
becomes
at
once
a
queen
and
a
wife
,
and
it
is
*NL*
impossible
to
thank
and
love
her
sufficiently
.
Morrel
longed
intensely
*NL*
for
the
moment
when
he
should
hear
Valentine
say
,
``
Here
I
am
,
*NL*
Maximilian
;
come
and
help
me
.
''
He
had
arranged
everything
for
her
*NL*
escape
;
two
ladders
were
hidden
in
the
clover-field
;
a
cabriolet
was
*NL*
ordered
for
Maximilian
alone
,
without
a
servant
,
without
lights
;
at
the
*NL*
turning
of
the
first
street
they
would
light
the
lamps
,
as
it
would
be
*NL*
foolish
to
attract
the
notice
of
the
police
by
too
many
precautions
.
*NL*
Occasionally
he
shuddered
;
he
thought
of
the
moment
when
,
from
the
*NL*
top
of
that
wall
,
he
should
protect
the
descent
of
his
dear
Valentine
,
*NL*
pressing
in
his
arms
for
the
first
time
her
of
whom
he
had
yet
only
*NL*
kissed
the
delicate
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
afternoon
arrived
and
he
felt
that
the
hour
was
drawing
near
,
*NL*
he
wished
for
solitude
,
his
agitation
was
extreme
;
a
simple
question
*NL*
from
a
friend
would
have
irritated
him
.
He
shut
himself
in
his
room
,
and
*NL*
tried
to
read
,
but
his
eye
glanced
over
the
page
without
understanding
*NL*
a
word
,
and
he
threw
away
the
book
,
and
for
the
second
time
sat
down
*NL*
to
sketch
his
plan
,
the
ladders
and
the
fence
.
At
length
the
hour
*NL*
drew
near
.
Never
did
a
man
deeply
in
love
allow
the
clocks
to
go
on
*NL*
peacefully
.
Morrel
tormented
his
so
effectually
that
they
struck
eight
*NL*
at
half-past
six
.
He
then
said
,
``
It
is
time
to
start
;
the
signature
was
*NL*
indeed
fixed
to
take
place
at
nine
o'clock
,
but
perhaps
Valentine
will
*NL*
not
wait
for
that
.
''
Consequently
,
Morrel
,
having
left
the
Rue
Meslay
*NL*
at
half-past
eight
by
his
timepiece
,
entered
the
clover-field
while
*NL*
the
clock
of
Saint-Phillippe
du
Roule
was
striking
eight
.
The
horse
and
*NL*
cabriolet
were
concealed
behind
a
small
ruin
,
where
Morrel
had
often
*NL*
waited
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
night
gradually
drew
on
,
and
the
foliage
in
the
garden
assumed
a
*NL*
deeper
hue
.
Then
Morrel
came
out
from
his
hiding-place
with
a
beating
*NL*
heart
,
and
looked
through
the
small
opening
in
the
gate
;
there
was
yet
*NL*
no
one
to
be
seen
.
The
clock
struck
half-past
eight
,
and
still
another
*NL*
half-hour
was
passed
in
waiting
,
while
Morrel
walked
to
and
fro
,
and
*NL*
gazed
more
and
more
frequently
through
the
opening
.
The
garden
became
*NL*
darker
still
,
but
in
the
darkness
he
looked
in
vain
for
the
white
dress
,
*NL*
and
in
the
silence
he
vainly
listened
for
the
sound
of
footsteps
.
The
*NL*
house
,
which
was
discernible
through
the
trees
,
remained
in
darkness
,
*NL*
and
gave
no
indication
that
so
important
an
event
as
the
signature
of
a
*NL*
marriage-contract
was
going
on
.
Morrel
looked
at
his
watch
,
which
wanted
*NL*
a
quarter
to
ten
;
but
soon
the
same
clock
he
had
already
heard
strike
*NL*
two
or
three
times
rectified
the
error
by
striking
half-past
nine
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
already
half
an
hour
past
the
time
Valentine
had
fixed
.
It
*NL*
was
a
terrible
moment
for
the
young
man
.
The
slightest
rustling
of
the
*NL*
foliage
,
the
least
whistling
of
the
wind
,
attracted
his
attention
,
and
*NL*
drew
the
perspiration
to
his
brow
;
then
he
tremblingly
fixed
his
ladder
,
*NL*
and
,
not
to
lose
a
moment
,
placed
his
foot
on
the
first
step
.
Amidst
*NL*
all
these
alternations
of
hope
and
fear
,
the
clock
struck
ten
.
``
It
is
*NL*
impossible
,
''
said
Maximilian
,
``
that
the
signing
of
a
contract
should
*NL*
occupy
so
long
a
time
without
unexpected
interruptions
.
I
have
weighed
*NL*
all
the
chances
,
calculated
the
time
required
for
all
the
forms
;
*NL*
something
must
have
happened
.
''
And
then
he
walked
rapidly
to
and
fro
,
*NL*
and
pressed
his
burning
forehead
against
the
fence
.
Had
Valentine
*NL*
fainted
?
or
had
she
been
discovered
and
stopped
in
her
flight
?
These
*NL*
were
the
only
obstacles
which
appeared
possible
to
the
young
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
idea
that
her
strength
had
failed
her
in
attempting
to
escape
,
*NL*
and
that
she
had
fainted
in
one
of
the
paths
,
was
the
one
that
most
*NL*
impressed
itself
upon
his
mind
.
``
In
that
case
,
''
said
he
,
``
I
should
lose
*NL*
her
,
and
by
my
own
fault
.
''
He
dwelt
on
this
idea
for
a
moment
,
then
it
*NL*
appeared
reality
.
He
even
thought
he
could
perceive
something
on
the
*NL*
ground
at
a
distance
;
he
ventured
to
call
,
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
*NL*
the
wind
wafted
back
an
almost
inarticulate
sigh
.
At
last
the
half-hour
*NL*
struck
.
It
was
impossible
to
wait
longer
,
his
temples
throbbed
*NL*
violently
,
his
eyes
were
growing
dim
;
he
passed
one
leg
over
the
wall
,
*NL*
and
in
a
moment
leaped
down
on
the
other
side
.
He
was
on
Villefort
's
*NL*
premises
--
had
arrived
there
by
scaling
the
wall
.
What
might
be
the
*NL*
consequences
?
However
,
he
had
not
ventured
thus
far
to
draw
back
.
He
*NL*
followed
a
short
distance
close
under
the
wall
,
then
crossed
a
path
,
hid
*NL*
entered
a
clump
of
trees
.
In
a
moment
he
had
passed
through
them
,
and
*NL*
could
see
the
house
distinctly
.
Then
Morrel
saw
that
he
had
been
right
*NL*
in
believing
that
the
house
was
not
illuminated
.
Instead
of
lights
at
*NL*
every
window
,
as
is
customary
on
days
of
ceremony
,
he
saw
only
a
gray
*NL*
mass
,
which
was
veiled
also
by
a
cloud
,
which
at
that
moment
obscured
*NL*
the
moon
's
feeble
light
.
A
light
moved
rapidly
from
time
to
time
past
*NL*
three
windows
of
the
second
floor
.
These
three
windows
were
in
Madame
de
*NL*
Saint-Meran
's
room
.
Another
remained
motionless
behind
some
red
curtains
*NL*
which
were
in
Madame
de
Villefort
's
bedroom
.
Morrel
guessed
all
this
.
So
*NL*
many
times
,
in
order
to
follow
Valentine
in
thought
at
every
hour
in
the
*NL*
day
,
had
he
made
her
describe
the
whole
house
,
that
without
having
seen
*NL*
it
he
knew
it
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
darkness
and
silence
alarmed
Morrel
still
more
than
Valentine
's
*NL*
absence
had
done
.
Almost
mad
with
grief
,
and
determined
to
venture
*NL*
everything
in
order
to
see
Valentine
once
more
,
and
be
certain
of
the
*NL*
misfortune
he
feared
,
Morrel
gained
the
edge
of
the
clump
of
trees
,
and
*NL*
was
going
to
pass
as
quickly
as
possible
through
the
flower-garden
,
when
*NL*
the
sound
of
a
voice
,
still
at
some
distance
,
but
which
was
borne
upon
*NL*
the
wind
,
reached
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
sound
,
as
he
was
already
partially
exposed
to
view
,
he
stepped
*NL*
back
and
concealed
himself
completely
,
remaining
perfectly
motionless
.
*NL*
He
had
formed
his
resolution
.
If
it
was
Valentine
alone
,
he
would
speak
*NL*
as
she
passed
;
if
she
was
accompanied
,
and
he
could
not
speak
,
still
he
*NL*
should
see
her
,
and
know
that
she
was
safe
;
if
they
were
strangers
,
he
*NL*
would
listen
to
their
conversation
,
and
might
understand
something
of
*NL*
this
hitherto
incomprehensible
mystery
.
The
moon
had
just
then
escaped
*NL*
from
behind
the
cloud
which
had
concealed
it
,
and
Morrel
saw
Villefort
*NL*
come
out
upon
the
steps
,
followed
by
a
gentleman
in
black
.
They
*NL*
descended
,
and
advanced
towards
the
clump
of
trees
,
and
Morrel
soon
*NL*
recognized
the
other
gentleman
as
Doctor
d'Avrigny
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
,
seeing
them
approach
,
drew
back
mechanically
,
until
he
*NL*
found
himself
stopped
by
a
sycamore-tree
in
the
centre
of
the
clump
;
*NL*
there
he
was
compelled
to
remain
.
Soon
the
two
gentlemen
stopped
also
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
my
dear
doctor
,
''
said
the
procureur
,
``
heaven
declares
itself
*NL*
against
my
house
!
What
a
dreadful
death
--
what
a
blow
!
Seek
not
to
*NL*
console
me
;
alas
,
nothing
can
alleviate
so
great
a
sorrow
--
the
wound
is
*NL*
too
deep
and
too
fresh
!
Dead
,
dead
!
''
The
cold
sweat
sprang
to
the
young
*NL*
man
's
brow
,
and
his
teeth
chattered
.
Who
could
be
dead
in
that
house
,
*NL*
which
Villefort
himself
had
called
accursed
?
``
My
dear
M.
de
Villefort
,
''
*NL*
replied
the
doctor
,
with
a
tone
which
redoubled
the
terror
of
the
young
*NL*
man
,
``
I
have
not
led
you
here
to
console
you
;
on
the
contrary
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
can
you
mean
?
''
asked
the
procureur
,
alarmed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
mean
that
behind
the
misfortune
which
has
just
happened
to
you
,
there
*NL*
is
another
,
perhaps
,
still
greater
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
it
be
possible
?
''
murmured
Villefort
,
clasping
his
hands
.
``
What
are
*NL*
you
going
to
tell
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
we
quite
alone
,
my
friend
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
quite
;
but
why
all
these
precautions
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
I
have
a
terrible
secret
to
communicate
to
you
,
''
said
the
*NL*
doctor
.
``
Let
us
sit
down
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Villefort
fell
,
rather
than
seated
himself
.
The
doctor
stood
before
him
,
*NL*
with
one
hand
placed
on
his
shoulder
.
Morrel
,
horrified
,
supported
*NL*
his
head
with
one
hand
,
and
with
the
other
pressed
his
heart
,
lest
its
*NL*
beatings
should
be
heard
.
``
Dead
,
dead
!
''
repeated
he
within
himself
;
and
*NL*
he
felt
as
if
he
were
also
dying
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Speak
,
doctor
--
I
am
listening
,
''
said
Villefort
;
``
strike
--
I
am
prepared
*NL*
for
everything
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madame
de
Saint-Meran
was
,
doubtless
,
advancing
in
years
,
but
she
*NL*
enjoyed
excellent
health
.
''
Morrel
began
again
to
breathe
freely
,
which
*NL*
he
had
not
done
during
the
last
ten
minutes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Grief
has
consumed
her
,
''
said
Villefort
--
``
yes
,
grief
,
doctor
!
After
*NL*
living
forty
years
with
the
marquis
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
not
grief
,
my
dear
Villefort
,
''
said
the
doctor
;
``
grief
may
kill
,
*NL*
although
it
rarely
does
,
and
never
in
a
day
,
never
in
an
hour
,
never
*NL*
in
ten
minutes
.
''
Villefort
answered
nothing
,
he
simply
raised
his
*NL*
head
,
which
had
been
cast
down
before
,
and
looked
at
the
doctor
with
*NL*
amazement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Were
you
present
during
the
last
struggle
?
''
asked
M.
d'Avrigny
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
,
''
replied
the
procureur
;
``
you
begged
me
not
to
leave
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
notice
the
symptoms
of
the
disease
to
which
Madame
de
*NL*
Saint-Meran
has
fallen
a
victim
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
.
Madame
de
Saint-Meran
had
three
successive
attacks
,
at
intervals
*NL*
of
some
minutes
,
each
one
more
serious
than
the
former
.
When
you
*NL*
arrived
,
Madame
de
Saint-Meran
had
already
been
panting
for
breath
some
*NL*
minutes
;
she
then
had
a
fit
,
which
I
took
to
be
simply
a
nervous
attack
,
*NL*
and
it
was
only
when
I
saw
her
raise
herself
in
the
bed
,
and
her
*NL*
limbs
and
neck
appear
stiffened
,
that
I
became
really
alarmed
.
Then
*NL*
I
understood
from
your
countenance
there
was
more
to
fear
than
I
had
*NL*
thought
.
This
crisis
past
,
I
endeavored
to
catch
your
eye
,
but
could
*NL*
not
.
You
held
her
hand
--
you
were
feeling
her
pulse
--
and
the
second
fit
*NL*
came
on
before
you
had
turned
towards
me
.
This
was
more
terrible
than
*NL*
the
first
;
the
same
nervous
movements
were
repeated
,
and
the
mouth
*NL*
contracted
and
turned
purple
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
at
the
third
she
expired
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
the
end
of
the
first
attack
I
discovered
symptoms
of
tetanus
;
you
*NL*
confirmed
my
opinion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
before
others
,
''
replied
the
doctor
;
``
but
now
we
are
alone
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
going
to
say
?
Oh
,
spare
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
the
symptoms
of
tetanus
and
poisoning
by
vegetable
substances
are
*NL*
the
same
.
''
M.
de
Villefort
started
from
his
seat
,
then
in
a
moment
fell
*NL*
down
again
,
silent
and
motionless
.
Morrel
knew
not
if
he
were
dreaming
*NL*
or
awake
.
``
Listen
,
''
said
the
doctor
;
``
I
know
the
full
importance
of
the
*NL*
statement
I
have
just
made
,
and
the
disposition
of
the
man
to
whom
I
*NL*
have
made
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
speak
to
me
as
a
magistrate
or
as
a
friend
?
''
asked
Villefort
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
a
friend
,
and
only
as
a
friend
,
at
this
moment
.
The
similarity
in
*NL*
the
symptoms
of
tetanus
and
poisoning
by
vegetable
substances
is
so
*NL*
great
,
that
were
I
obliged
to
affirm
by
oath
what
I
have
now
stated
,
I
*NL*
should
hesitate
;
I
therefore
repeat
to
you
,
I
speak
not
to
a
magistrate
,
*NL*
but
to
a
friend
.
And
to
that
friend
I
say
.
`
During
the
three-quarters
of
*NL*
an
hour
that
the
struggle
continued
,
I
watched
the
convulsions
and
the
*NL*
death
of
Madame
de
Saint-Meran
,
and
am
thoroughly
convinced
that
not
*NL*
only
did
her
death
proceed
from
poison
,
but
I
could
also
specify
the
*NL*
poison
.

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
it
be
possible

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The

broken

*NL*
excitation
of

brain
,
torpor
of
the
nerve
centres
.
Madame
de
*NL*
Saint-Meran
succumbed
to
a
powerful
dose
of
brucine
or
of
strychnine
,
*NL*
which
by
some
mistake
,
perhaps
,
has
been
given
to
her

Villefort
seized
*NL*
the
doctor
's
hand
.
``
Oh
,
it
is
impossible

said
he
,
``
I
must
be

It
is
frightful

*NL*
``

M.

,
``

aloud

Of

Saint-Meran

*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
is
more
simple
.
You
know
poisons
become
remedies
in
certain
*NL*
diseases
,
of
which
paralysis
is
one
.
For
instance
,
having
tried
every
*NL*
other
remedy
to
restore
movement
and
speech
to
M.
Noirtier
,
I
resolved
*NL*
to
try
one
last
means
,
and
for
three
months
I
have
been
giving
him
*NL*
brucine
;
so
that
in
the
last
dose
I
ordered
for
him
there
were
six
*NL*
grains
.
This
quantity
,
which
is
perfectly
safe
to
administer
to
the
*NL*
paralyzed
frame
of
M.
Noirtier
,
which
has
become
gradually
accustomed
to
*NL*
it
,
would
be
sufficient
to
kill
another
person

*NL*
*NL*
``
My

there
is
no
communication
between
M.
Noirtier

apartment

that
of

Barrois
never
entered
*NL*
my
mother-in-law

In
short
,
doctor
although
I
know
you
to
be
the
*NL*
most
conscientious

No

*NL*
``

Villefort
in
despair

so

soon

necessary

impossible

Still
,
''
continued
the
*NL*
procureur
,
looking
at
the
doctor
with
uneasiness
,
``
if
you
wish
it
--
if
*NL*
you
demand
it

why
then
it
shall
be
done
.
But
,
doctor
,
you
see
me
*NL*
already
so
grieved
--
how
can
I
introduce
into
my
house
so
much
scandal
,
*NL*
after
so
much
sorrow
?
My
wife
and
my
daughter
would
die
of
it
!
And
I
,
*NL*
doctor
--
you
know
a
man
does
not
arrive
at
the
post
I
occupy
--
one
has
*NL*
not
been
king
's
attorney
twenty-five
years
without
having
amassed
a
*NL*
tolerable
number
of
enemies
;
mine
are
numerous
.
Let
this
affair
be
*NL*
talked
of
,
it
will
be
a
triumph
for
them
,
which
will
make
them
rejoice
,
*NL*
and
cover
me
with
shame
.
Pardon
me
,
doctor
,
these
worldly
ideas
;
were
*NL*
you
a
priest
I
should
not
dare
tell
you
that
,
but
you
are
a
man
,
and
*NL*
you
know
mankind
.
Doctor
,
pray
recall
your
words
;
you
have
said
nothing
,
*NL*
have
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
M.
de
Villefort
,
''
replied
the
doctor
,
``
my
first
duty
is
to
*NL*
humanity
.
I
would
have
saved
Madame
de
Saint-Meran
,
if
science
could
*NL*
have
done
it
;
but
she
is
dead
and
my
duty
regards
the
living
.
Let
us
*NL*
bury
this
terrible
secret
in
the
deepest
recesses
of
our
hearts
;
I
am
*NL*
willing
,
if
any
one
should
suspect
this
,
that
my
silence
on
the
subject
*NL*
should
be
imputed
to
my
ignorance
.
Meanwhile
,
sir
,
watch
always
--
watch
*NL*
carefully
,
for
perhaps
the
evil
may
not
stop
here
.
And
when
you
have
*NL*
found
the
culprit
,
if
you
find
him
,
I
will
say
to
you
,
`
You
are
a
*NL*
magistrate
,
do
as
you
will
!
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thank
you
,
doctor
,
''
said
Villefort
with
indescribable
joy
;
``
I
never
*NL*
had
a
better
friend
than
you
.
''
And
,
as
if
he
feared
Doctor
d'Avrigny
*NL*
would
recall
his
promise
,
he
hurried
him
towards
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
were
gone
,
Morrel
ventured
out
from
under
the
trees
,
and
the
*NL*
moon
shone
upon
his
face
,
which
was
so
pale
it
might
have
been
taken
*NL*
for
that
of
a
ghost
.
``
I
am
manifestly
protected
in
a
most
wonderful
,
but
*NL*
most
terrible
manner
,
''
said
he
;
``
but
Valentine
,
poor
girl
,
how
will
she
*NL*
bear
so
much
sorrow
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
thought
thus
,
he
looked
alternately
at
the
window
with
red
*NL*
curtains
and
the
three
windows
with
white
curtains
.
The
light
had
almost
*NL*
disappeared
from
the
former
;
doubtless
Madame
de
Villefort
had
just
put
*NL*
out
her
lamp
,
and
the
nightlamp
alone
reflected
its
dull
light
on
the
*NL*
window
.
At
the
extremity
of
the
building
,
on
the
contrary
,
he
saw
one
*NL*
of
the
three
windows
open
.
A
wax-light
placed
on
the
mantle-piece
threw
*NL*
some
of
its
pale
rays
without
,
and
a
shadow
was
seen
for
one
moment
on
*NL*
the
balcony
.
Morrel
shuddered
;
he
thought
he
heard
a
sob
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
can
not
be
wondered
at
that
his
mind
,
generally
so
courageous
,
but
*NL*
now
disturbed
by
the
two
strongest
human
passions
,
love
and
fear
,
was
*NL*
weakened
even
to
the
indulgence
of
superstitious
thoughts
.
Although
*NL*
it
was
impossible
that
Valentine
should
see
him
,
hidden
as
he
was
,
he
*NL*
thought
he
heard
the
shadow
at
the
window
call
him
;
his
disturbed
mind
*NL*
told
him
so
.
This
double
error
became
an
irresistible
reality
,
and
by
*NL*
one
of
the
incomprehensible
transports
of
youth
,
he
bounded
from
his
*NL*
hiding-place
,
and
with
two
strides
,
at
the
risk
of
being
seen
,
at
the
*NL*
risk
of
alarming
Valentine
,
at
the
risk
of
being
discovered
by
*NL*
some
exclamation
which
might
escape
the
young
girl
,
he
crossed
the
*NL*
flower-garden
,
which
by
the
light
of
the
moon
resembled
a
large
white
*NL*
lake
,
and
having
passed
the
rows
of
orange-trees
which
extended
in
front
*NL*
of
the
house
,
he
reached
the
step
,
ran
quickly
up
and
pushed
the
door
,
*NL*
which
opened
without
offering
any
resistance
.
Valentine
had
not
seen
*NL*
him
.
Her
eyes
,
raised
towards
heaven
,
were
watching
a
silvery
cloud
*NL*
gliding
over
the
azure
,
its
form
that
of
a
shadow
mounting
towards
*NL*
heaven
.
Her
poetic
and
excited
mind
pictured
it
as
the
soul
of
her
*NL*
grandmother
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
Morrel
had
traversed
the
anteroom
and
found
the
staircase
,
*NL*
which
,
being
carpeted
,
prevented
his
approach
being
heard
,
and
he
had
*NL*
regained
that
degree
of
confidence
that
the
presence
of
M.
de
Villefort
*NL*
even
would
not
have
alarmed
him
.
He
was
quite
prepared
for
any
such
*NL*
encounter
.
He
would
at
once
approach
Valentine
's
father
and
acknowledge
*NL*
all
,
begging
Villefort
to
pardon
and
sanction
the
love
which
united
two
*NL*
fond
and
loving
hearts
.
Morrel
was
mad
.
Happily
he
did
not
meet
any
one
.
*NL*
Now
,
especially
,
did
he
find
the
description
Valentine
had
given
of
the
*NL*
interior
of
the
house
useful
to
him
;
he
arrived
safely
at
the
top
of
*NL*
the
staircase
,
and
while
he
was
feeling
his
way
,
a
sob
indicated
the
*NL*
direction
he
was
to
take
.
He
turned
back
,
a
door
partly
open
enabled
him
*NL*
to
see
his
road
,
and
to
hear
the
voice
of
one
in
sorrow
.
He
pushed
the
*NL*
door
open
and
entered
.
At
the
other
end
of
the
room
,
under
a
white
sheet
*NL*
which
covered
it
,
lay
the
corpse
,
still
more
alarming
to
Morrel
since
*NL*
the
account
he
had
so
unexpectedly
overheard
.
By
its
side
,
on
her
knees
,
*NL*
and
with
her
head
buried
in
the
cushion
of
an
easy-chair
,
was
Valentine
,
*NL*
trembling
and
sobbing
,
her
hands
extended
above
her
head
,
clasped
and
*NL*
stiff
.
She
had
turned
from
the
window
,
which
remained
open
,
and
was
*NL*
praying
in
accents
that
would
have
affected
the
most
unfeeling
;
her
*NL*
words
were
rapid
,
incoherent
,
unintelligible
,
for
the
burning
weight
of
*NL*
grief
almost
stopped
her
utterance
.
The
moon
shining
through
the
open
*NL*
blinds
made
the
lamp
appear
to
burn
paler
,
and
cast
a
sepulchral
hue
*NL*
over
the
whole
scene
.
Morrel
could
not
resist
this
;
he
was
not
exemplary
*NL*
for
piety
,
he
was
not
easily
impressed
,
but
Valentine
suffering
,
*NL*
weeping
,
wringing
her
hands
before
him
,
was
more
than
he
could
bear
in
*NL*
silence
.
He
sighed
,
and
whispered
a
name
,
and
the
head
bathed
in
tears
*NL*
and
pressed
on
the
velvet
cushion
of
the
chair
--
a
head
like
that
of
*NL*
a
Magdalen
by
Correggio
--
was
raised
and
turned
towards
him
.
Valentine
*NL*
perceived
him
without
betraying
the
least
surprise
.
A
heart
overwhelmed
*NL*
with
one
great
grief
is
insensible
to
minor
emotions
.
Morrel
held
out
*NL*
his
hand
to
her
.
Valentine
,
as
her
only
apology
for
not
having
met
him
,
*NL*
pointed
to
the
corpse
under
the
sheet
,
and
began
to
sob
again
.
Neither
*NL*
dared
for
some
time
to
speak
in
that
room
.
They
hesitated
to
break
the
*NL*
silence
which
death
seemed
to
impose
;
at
length
Valentine
ventured
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
friend
,
''
said
she
,
``
how
came
you
here
?
Alas
,
I
would
say
you
are
*NL*
welcome
,
had
not
death
opened
the
way
for
you
into
this
house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Valentine
,
''
said
Morrel
with
a
trembling
voice
,
``
I
had
waited
since
*NL*
half-past
eight
,
and
did
not
see
you
come
;
I
became
uneasy
,
leaped
the
*NL*
wall
,
found
my
way
through
the
garden
,
when
voices
conversing
about
the
*NL*
fatal
event
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
voices
?
''
asked
Valentine
.
Morrel
shuddered
as
he
thought
of
the
*NL*
conversation
of
the
doctor
and
M.
de
Villefort
,
and
he
thought
he
could
*NL*
see
through
the
sheet
the
extended
hands
,
the
stiff
neck
,
and
the
purple
*NL*
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
servants
,
''
said
he
,
``
who
were
repeating
the
whole
of
the
sorrowful
*NL*
story
;
from
them
I
learned
it
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
was
risking
the
failure
of
our
plan
to
come
up
here
,
love
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Forgive
me
,
''
replied
Morrel
;
``
I
will
go
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Valentine
,
``
you
might
meet
some
one
;
stay
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
if
any
one
should
come
here
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
girl
shook
her
head
.
``
No
one
will
come
,
''
said
she
;
``
do
not
*NL*
fear
,
there
is
our
safeguard
,
''
pointing
to
the
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
has
become
of
M.
d'Epinay
?
''
replied
Morrel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
M.
Franz
arrived
to
sign
the
contract
just
as
my
dear
grandmother
was
*NL*
dying
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas
,
''
said
Morrel
with
a
feeling
of
selfish
joy
;
for
he
thought
this
*NL*
death
would
cause
the
wedding
to
be
postponed
indefinitely
.
``
But
what
*NL*
redoubles
my
sorrow
,
''
continued
the
young
girl
,
as
if
this
feeling
was
*NL*
to
receive
its
immediate
punishment
,
``
is
that
the
poor
old
lady
,
on
*NL*
her
death-bed
,
requested
that
the
marriage
might
take
place
as
soon
as
*NL*
possible
;
she
also
,
thinking
to
protect
me
,
was
acting
against
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hark
!
''
said
Morrel
.
They
both
listened
;
steps
were
distinctly
heard
in
*NL*
the
corridor
and
on
the
stairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
my
father
,
who
has
just
left
his
study
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
accompany
the
doctor
to
the
door
,
''
added
Morrel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
know
it
is
the
doctor
?
''
asked
Valentine
,
astonished
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
imagined
it
must
be
,
''
said
Morrel
.
Valentine
looked
at
the
young
man
;
*NL*
they
heard
the
street
door
close
,
then
M.
de
Villefort
locked
the
garden
*NL*
door
,
and
returned
up-stairs
.
He
stopped
a
moment
in
the
anteroom
,
as
*NL*
if
hesitating
whether
to
turn
to
his
own
apartment
or
into
Madame
*NL*
de
Saint-Meran
's
;
Morrel
concealed
himself
behind
a
door
;
Valentine
*NL*
remained
motionless
,
grief
seeming
to
deprive
her
of
all
fear
.
M.
de
*NL*
Villefort
passed
on
to
his
own
room
.
``
Now
,
''
said
Valentine
,
``
you
can
*NL*
neither
go
out
by
the
front
door
nor
by
the
garden
.
''
Morrel
looked
at
*NL*
her
with
astonishment
.
``
There
is
but
one
way
left
you
that
is
safe
,
''
*NL*
said
she
;
``
it
is
through
my
grandfather
's
room
.
''
She
rose
,
``
Come
,
''
she
*NL*
added
.
--
``
Where
?
''
asked
Maximilian
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
my
grandfather
's
room
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
in
M.
Noirtier
's
apartment
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
you
mean
it
,
Valentine
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
long
wished
it
;
he
is
my
only
remaining
friend
and
we
both
need
*NL*
his
help
,

come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
careful
,
Valentine
,
''
said
Morrel
,
hesitating
to
comply
with
the
*NL*
young
girl
's
wishes
;
``
I
now
see
my
error
--
I
acted
like
a
madman
in
*NL*
coming
in
here
.
Are
you
sure
you
are
more
reasonable
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Valentine
;
``
and
I
have
but
one
scruple
,
--
that
of
leaving
my
*NL*
dear
grandmother
's
remains
,
which
I
had
undertaken
to
watch
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Valentine
,
''
said
Morrel
,
``
death
is
in
itself
sacred
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Valentine
;
``
besides
,
it
will
not
be
for
long
.
''
She
then
*NL*
crossed
the
corridor
,
and
led
the
way
down
a
narrow
staircase
to
M.
*NL*
Noirtier
's
room
;
Morrel
followed
her
on
tiptoe
;
at
the
door
they
found
*NL*
the
old
servant
.
``
Barrois
,
''
said
Valentine
,
``
shut
the
door
,
and
let
*NL*
no
one
come
in
.
''
She
passed
first
.
Noirtier
,
seated
in
his
chair
,
and
*NL*
listening
to
every
sound
,
was
watching
the
door
;
he
saw
Valentine
,
and
*NL*
his
eye
brightened
.
There
was
something
grave
and
solemn
in
the
approach
*NL*
of
the
young
girl
which
struck
the
old
man
,
and
immediately
his
bright
*NL*
eye
began
to
interrogate
.
``
Dear
grandfather
.
''
said
she
hurriedly
,
``
you
*NL*
know
poor
grandmamma
died
an
hour
since
,
and
now
I
have
no
friend
in
the
*NL*
world
but
you
.
''
His
expressive
eyes
evinced
the
greatest
tenderness
.
``
To
*NL*
you
alone
,
then
,
may
I
confide
my
sorrows
and
my
hopes
?
''
The
paralytic
*NL*
motioned
``
Yes
.
''
Valentine
took
Maximilian
's
hand
.
``
Look
attentively
,
*NL*
then
,
at
this
gentleman
.
''
The
old
man
fixed
his
scrutinizing
gaze
with
*NL*
slight
astonishment
on
Morrel
.
``
It
is
M.
Maximilian
Morrel
,
''
said
*NL*
she
;
``
the
son
of
that
good
merchant
of
Marseilles
,
whom
you
doubtless
*NL*
recollect
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
the
old
man
.
``
He
brings
an
irreproachable
name
,
which
*NL*
Maximilian
is
likely
to
render
glorious
,
since
at
thirty
years
of
age
he
*NL*
is
a
captain
,
an
officer
of
the
Legion
of
Honor
.
''
The
old
man
signified
*NL*
that
he
recollected
him
.
``
Well
,
grandpapa
,
''
said
Valentine
,
kneeling
*NL*
before
him
,
and
pointing
to
Maximilian
,
``
I
love
him
,
and
will
be
only
*NL*
his
;
were
I
compelled
to
marry
another
,
I
would
destroy
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
eyes
of
the
paralytic
expressed
a
multitude
of
tumultuous
thoughts
.
*NL*
``
You
like
M.
Maximilian
Morrel
,
do
you
not
,
grandpapa
?
''
asked
Valentine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
will
protect
us
,
who
are
your
children
,
against
the
will
of
my
*NL*
father
?
''
--
Noirtier
cast
an
intelligent
glance
at
Morrel
,
as
if
to
say
,
*NL*
``
perhaps
I
may
.
''
Maximilian
understood
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mademoiselle
,
''
said
he
,
``
you
have
a
sacred
duty
to
fulfil
in
your
*NL*
deceased
grandmother
's
room
,
will
you
allow
me
the
honor
of
a
few
*NL*
minutes
'
conversation
with
M.
Noirtier
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
it
,
''
said
the
old
man
's
eye
.
Then
he
looked
anxiously
at
*NL*
Valentine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
fear
he
will
not
understand
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
we
have
so
often
spoken
of
you
,
that
he
knows
exactly
how
I
talk
*NL*
to
you
.
''
Then
turning
to
Maximilian
,
with
an
adorable
smile
;
although
*NL*
shaded
by
sorrow
,
--
``
He
knows
everything
I
know
,
''
said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
Valentine
arose
,
placed
a
chair
for
Morrel
,
requested
Barrois
not
*NL*
to
admit
any
one
,
and
having
tenderly
embraced
her
grandfather
,
and
*NL*
sorrowfully
taken
leave
of
Morrel
,
she
went
away
.
To
prove
to
Noirtier
*NL*
that
he
was
in
Valentine
's
confidence
and
knew
all
their
secrets
,
Morrel
*NL*
took
the
dictionary
,
a
pen
,
and
some
paper
,
and
placed
them
all
on
a
*NL*
table
where
there
was
a
light
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
first
,
''
said
Morrel
,
``
allow
me
,
sir
,
to
tell
you
who
I
am
,
how
much
*NL*
I
love
Mademoiselle
Valentine
,
and
what
are
my
designs
respecting
her
.
''
*NL*
Noirtier
made
a
sign
that
he
would
listen
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
an
imposing
sight
to
witness
this
old
man
,
apparently
a
mere
*NL*
useless
burden
,
becoming
the
sole
protector
,
support
,
and
adviser
of
the
*NL*
lovers
who
were
both
young
,
beautiful
,
and
strong
.
His
remarkably
*NL*
noble
and
austere
expression
struck
Morrel
,
who
began
his
story
with
*NL*
trembling
.
He
related
the
manner
in
which
he
had
become
acquainted
with
*NL*
Valentine
,
and
how
he
had
loved
her
,
and
that
Valentine
,
in
her
solitude
*NL*
and
her
misfortune
,
had
accepted
the
offer
of
his
devotion
.
He
told
*NL*
him
his
birth
,
his
position
,
his
fortune
,
and
more
than
once
,
when
he
*NL*
consulted
the
look
of
the
paralytic
,
that
look
answered
,
``
That
is
good
,
*NL*
proceed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
,
''
said
Morrel
,
when
he
had
finished
the
first
part
of
his
*NL*
recital
,
``
now
I
have
told
you
of
my
love
and
my
hopes
,
may
I
inform
you
*NL*
of
my
intentions
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
signified
the
old
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
was
our
resolution
;
a
cabriolet
was
in
waiting
at
the
gate
,
in
*NL*
which
I
intended
to
carry
off
Valentine
to
my
sister
's
house
,
to
marry
*NL*
her
,
and
to
wait
respectfully
M.
de
Villefort
's
pardon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Noirtier
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
must
not
do
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
not
sanction
our
project
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
another
way
,
''
said
Morrel
.
The
old
man
's
interrogative
eye
*NL*
said
,
``
What
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
go
,
''
continued
Maximilian
,
``
I
will
seek
M.
Franz
d'Epinay
--
I
*NL*
am
happy
to
be
able
to
mention
this
in
Mademoiselle
de
Villefort
's
*NL*
absence
--
and
will
conduct
myself
toward
him
so
as
to
compel
him
to
*NL*
challenge
me
.
''
Noirtier
's
look
continued
to
interrogate
.
``
You
wish
to
*NL*
know
what
I
will
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
find
him
,
as
I
told
you
.
I
will
tell
him
the
ties
which
bind
me
*NL*
to
Mademoiselle
Valentine
;
if
he
be
a
sensible
man
,
he
will
prove
it
by
*NL*
renouncing
of
his
own
accord
the
hand
of
his
betrothed
,
and
will
secure
*NL*
my
friendship
,
and
love
until
death
;
if
he
refuse
,
either
through
*NL*
interest
or
ridiculous
pride
,
after
I
have
proved
to
him
that
he
would
*NL*
be
forcing
my
wife
from
me
,
that
Valentine
loves
me
,
and
will
have
no
*NL*
other
,
I
will
fight
with
him
,
give
him
every
advantage
,
and
I
shall
*NL*
kill
him
,
or
he
will
kill
me
;
if
I
am
victorious
,
he
will
not
marry
*NL*
Valentine
,
and
if
I
die
,
I
am
very
sure
Valentine
will
not
marry
him
.
''
*NL*
Noirtier
watched
,
with
indescribable
pleasure
,
this
noble
and
sincere
*NL*
countenance
,
on
which
every
sentiment
his
tongue
uttered
was
depicted
,
*NL*
adding
by
the
expression
of
his
fine
features
all
that
coloring
adds
to
*NL*
a
sound
and
faithful
drawing
.
Still
,
when
Morrel
had
finished
,
he
shut
*NL*
his
eyes
several
times
,
which
was
his
manner
of
saying
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
?
''
said
Morrel
;
``
you
disapprove
of
this
second
project
,
as
you
did
of
*NL*
the
first
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
,
''
signified
the
old
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
then
must
be
done
?
''
asked
Morrel
.
``
Madame
de
Saint-Meran
's
*NL*
last
request
was
,
that
the
marriage
might
not
be
delayed
;
must
I
let
*NL*
things
take
their
course
?
''
Noirtier
did
not
move
.
``
I
understand
,
''
said
*NL*
Morrel
;
``
I
am
to
wait
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
delay
may
ruin
our
plan
,
sir
,
''
replied
the
young
man
.
``
Alone
,
*NL*
Valentine
has
no
power
;
she
will
be
compelled
to
submit
.
I
am
here
*NL*
almost
miraculously
,
and
can
scarcely
hope
for
so
good
an
opportunity
to
*NL*
occur
again
.
Believe
me
,
there
are
only
the
two
plans
I
have
proposed
to
*NL*
you
;
forgive
my
vanity
,
and
tell
me
which
you
prefer
.
Do
you
authorize
*NL*
Mademoiselle
Valentine
to
intrust
herself
to
my
honor
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
prefer
I
should
seek
M.
d'Epinay
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whence
then
will
come
the
help
we
need
--
from
chance
?
''
resumed
Morrel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
thoroughly
understand
me
,
sir
?
Pardon
my
eagerness
,
for
my
life
*NL*
depends
on
your
answer
.
Will
our
help
come
from
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
sure
of
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
There
was
so
much
firmness
in
the
look
which
gave
this
answer
,
*NL*
no
one
could
,
at
any
rate
,
doubt
his
will
,
if
they
did
his
power
.
``
Oh
,
*NL*
thank
you
a
thousand
times
!
But
how
,
unless
a
miracle
should
restore
*NL*
your
speech
,
your
gesture
,
your
movement
,
how
can
you
,
chained
to
that
*NL*
arm-chair
,
dumb
and
motionless
,
oppose
this
marriage
?
''
A
smile
lit
up
*NL*
the
old
man
's
face
,
a
strange
smile
of
the
eyes
in
a
paralyzed
face
.
*NL*
``
Then
I
must
wait
?
''
asked
the
young
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
the
contract
?
''
The
same
smile
returned
.
``
Will
you
assure
me
it
*NL*
shall
not
be
signed
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Noirtier
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
contract
shall
not
be
signed
!
''
cried
Morrel
.
``
Oh
,
pardon
me
,
sir
;
I
*NL*
can
scarcely
realize
so
great
a
happiness
.
Will
they
not
sign
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
the
paralytic
.
Notwithstanding
that
assurance
,
Morrel
still
*NL*
hesitated
.
This
promise
of
an
impotent
old
man
was
so
strange
that
,
*NL*
instead
of
being
the
result
of
the
power
of
his
will
,
it
might
emanate
*NL*
from
enfeebled
organs
.
Is
it
not
natural
that
the
madman
,
ignorant
of
*NL*
his
folly
,
should
attempt
things
beyond
his
power
?
The
weak
man
talks
of
*NL*
burdens
he
can
raise
,
the
timid
of
giants
he
can
confront
,
the
poor
*NL*
of
treasures
he
spends
,
the
most
humble
peasant
,
in
the
height
of
his
*NL*
pride
,
calls
himself
Jupiter
.
Whether
Noirtier
understood
the
young
*NL*
man
's
indecision
,
or
whether
he
had
not
full
confidence
in
his
docility
,
*NL*
he
looked
uneasily
at
him
.
``
What
do
you
wish
,
sir
?
''
asked
Morrel
;
*NL*
``
that
I
should
renew
my
promise
of
remaining
tranquil
?
''
Noirtier
's
eye
*NL*
remained
fixed
and
firm
,
as
if
to
imply
that
a
promise
did
not
suffice
;
*NL*
then
it
passed
from
his
face
to
his
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
I
swear
to
you
,
sir
?
''
asked
Maximilian
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
the
paralytic
with
the
same
solemnity
.
Morrel
understood
*NL*
that
the
old
man
attached
great
importance
to
an
oath
.
He
extended
his
*NL*
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
swear
to
you
,
on
my
honor
,
''
said
he
,
``
to
await
your
decision
*NL*
respecting
the
course
I
am
to
pursue
with
M.
d'Epinay
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
right
,
''
said
the
old
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
''
said
Morrel
,
``
do
you
wish
me
to
retire
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Without
seeing
Mademoiselle
Valentine
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Morrel
made
a
sign
that
he
was
ready
to
obey
.
``
But
,
''
said
he
,
``
first
*NL*
allow
me
to
embrace
you
as
your
daughter
did
just
now
.
''
Noirtier
's
*NL*
expression
could
not
be
understood
.
The
young
man
pressed
his
lips
on
*NL*
the
same
spot
,
on
the
old
man
's
forehead
,
where
Valentine
's
had
been
.
*NL*
Then
he
bowed
a
second
time
and
retired
.
He
found
outside
the
door
*NL*
the
old
servant
,
to
whom
Valentine
had
given
directions
.
Morrel
was
*NL*
conducted
along
a
dark
passage
,
which
led
to
a
little
door
opening
*NL*
on
the
garden
,
soon
found
the
spot
where
he
had
entered
,
with
the
*NL*
assistance
of
the
shrubs
gained
the
top
of
the
wall
,
and
by
his
ladder
*NL*
was
in
an
instant
in
the
clover-field
where
his
cabriolet
was
still
*NL*
waiting
for
him
.
He
got
in
it
,
and
thoroughly
wearied
by
so
many
*NL*
emotions
,
arrived
about
midnight
in
the
Rue
Meslay
,
threw
himself
on
his
*NL*
bed
and
slept
soundly
.

Chapter

The
Villefort
Family
Vault
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
days
after
,
a
considerable
crowd
was
assembled
,
towards
ten
o'clock
*NL*
in
the
morning
,
around
the
door
of
M.
de
Villefort
's
house
,
and
a
*NL*
long
file
of
mourning-coaches
and
private
carriages
extended
along
the
*NL*
Faubourg
Saint-Honore
and
the
Rue
de
la
Pepiniere
.
Among
them
was
one
*NL*
of
a
very
singular
form
,
which
appeared
to
have
come
from
a
distance
.
It
*NL*
was
a
kind
of
covered
wagon
,
painted
black
,
and
was
one
of
the
first
*NL*
to
arrive
.
Inquiry
was
made
,
and
it
was
ascertained
that
,
by
a
strange
*NL*
coincidence
,
this
carriage
contained
the
corpse
of
the
Marquis
de
*NL*
Saint-Meran
,
and
that
those
who
had
come
thinking
to
attend
one
funeral
*NL*
would
follow
two
.
Their
number
was
great
.
The
Marquis
de
Saint-Meran
,
*NL*
one
of
the
most
zealous
and
faithful
dignitaries
of
Louis
XVIII
.
and
*NL*
King
Charles
X.
,
had
preserved
a
great
number
of
friends
,
and
these
,
*NL*
added
to
the
personages
whom
the
usages
of
society
gave
Villefort
a
*NL*
claim
on
,
formed
a
considerable
body
.
*NL*
*NL*
Due
information
was
given
to
the
authorities
,
and
permission
obtained
*NL*
that
the
two
funerals
should
take
place
at
the
same
time
.
A
second
*NL*
hearse
,
decked
with
the
same
funereal
pomp
,
was
brought
to
M.
de
*NL*
Villefort
's
door
,
and
the
coffin
removed
into
it
from
the
post-wagon
.
*NL*
The
two
bodies
were
to
be
interred
in
the
cemetery
of
Pere-la-Chaise
,
*NL*
where
M.
de
Villefort
had
long
since
had
a
tomb
prepared
for
the
*NL*
reception
of
his
family
.
The
remains
of
poor
Renee
were
already
*NL*
deposited
there
,
and
now
,
after
ten
years
of
separation
,
her
father
*NL*
and
mother
were
to
be
reunited
with
her
.
The
Parisians
,
always
curious
,
*NL*
always
affected
by
funereal
display
,
looked
on
with
religious
silence
*NL*
while
the
splendid
procession
accompanied
to
their
last
abode
two
of
the
*NL*
number
of
the
old
aristocracy
--
the
greatest
protectors
of
commerce
and
*NL*
sincere
devotees
to
their
principles
.
In
one
of
the
mourning-coaches
*NL*
Beauchamp
,
Debray
,
and
Chateau-Renaud
were
talking
of
the
very
sudden
*NL*
death
of
the
marchioness
.
``
I
saw
Madame
de
Saint-Meran
only
last
year
at
*NL*
Marseilles
,
when
I
was
coming
back
from
Algiers
,
''
said
Chateau-Renaud
;
*NL*
``
she
looked
like
a
woman
destined
to
live
to
be
a
hundred
years
old
,
*NL*
from
her
apparent
sound
health
and
great
activity
of
mind
and
body
.
How
*NL*
old
was
she
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Franz
assured
me
,
''
replied
Albert
,
``
that
she
was
sixty-six
years
old
.
*NL*
But
she
has
not
died
of
old
age
,
but
of
grief
;
it
appears
that
since
*NL*
the
death
of
the
marquis
,
which
affected
her
very
deeply
,
she
has
not
*NL*
completely
recovered
her
reason
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
of
what
disease
,
then
,
did
she
die
?
''
asked
Debray
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
said
to
have
been
a
congestion
of
the
brain
,
or
apoplexy
,
which
*NL*
is
the
same
thing
,
is
it
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nearly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
difficult
to
believe
that
it
was
apoplexy
,
''
said
Beauchamp
.
*NL*
``
Madame
de
Saint-Meran
,
whom
I
once
saw
,
was
short
,
of
slender
form
,
*NL*
and
of
a
much
more
nervous
than
sanguine
temperament
;
grief
could
*NL*
hardly
produce
apoplexy
in
such
a
constitution
as
that
of
Madame
de
*NL*
Saint-Meran
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
any
rate
,
''
said
Albert
,
``
whatever
disease
or
doctor
may
have
killed
*NL*
her
,
M.
de
Villefort
,
or
rather
,
Mademoiselle
Valentine
,
--
or
,
still
*NL*
rather
,
our
friend
Franz
,
inherits
a
magnificent
fortune
,
amounting
,
I
*NL*
believe
,
to
80,000
livres
per
annum
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
this
fortune
will
be
doubled
at
the
death
of
the
old
Jacobin
,
*NL*
Noirtier
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
a
tenacious
old
grandfather
,
''
said
Beauchamp
.
``
Tenacem
*NL*
propositi
virum
.
I
think
he
must
have
made
an
agreement
with
death
to
*NL*
outlive
all
his
heirs
,
and
he
appears
likely
to
succeed
.
He
resembles
*NL*
the
old
Conventionalist
of
'
93
,
who
said
to
Napoleon
,
in
1814
,
`
You
bend
*NL*
because
your
empire
is
a
young
stem
,
weakened
by
rapid
growth

Take

the
Republic
for
a
tutor
;
let
us
return
with
renewed
strength
to
the
*NL*
battle-field

and
I
promise
you
500,000
soldiers

another
Marengo

a

do
not
become

they
slumber

sometimes

but
only
revive

stronger

they
sleep
entirely

'
*NL*
Ideas
and
men
appeared
the
same
to
him
.
One
thing
only
puzzles
me
,
*NL*
namely
,
how
Franz
d'Epinay
will
like
a
grandfather
who
can
not
be
*NL*
separated
from
his
wife
.
But
where
is
Franz
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
first
carriage
,
with
M.
de
Villefort
,
who
considers
him
already
*NL*
as
one
of
the
family
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Such
was
the
conversation
in
almost
all
the
carriages
;
these
two
sudden
*NL*
deaths
,
so
quickly
following
each
other
,
astonished
every
one
,
but
no
*NL*
one
suspected
the
terrible
secret
which
M.
d'Avrigny
had
communicated
,
*NL*
in
his
nocturnal
walk
to
M.
de
Villefort
.
They
arrived
in
about
an
hour
*NL*
at
the
cemetery
;
the
weather
was
mild
,
but
dull
,
and
in
harmony
with
*NL*
the
funeral
ceremony
.
Among
the
groups
which
flocked
towards
the
*NL*
family
vault
,
Chateau-Renaud
recognized
Morrel
,
who
had
come
alone
in
a
*NL*
cabriolet
,
and
walked
silently
along
the
path
bordered
with
yew-trees
.
*NL*
``
You
here
?
''
said
Chateau-Renaud
,
passing
his
arms
through
the
young
*NL*
captain
's
;
``
are
you
a
friend
of
Villefort
's
?
How
is
it
that
I
have
never
*NL*
met
you
at
his
house
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
no
acquaintance
of
M.
de
Villefort
's
.
''
answered
Morrel
,
``
but
I
was
*NL*
of
Madame
de
Saint-Meran
.
''
Albert
came
up
to
them
at
this
moment
with
*NL*
Franz
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
time
and
place
are
but
ill-suited
for
an
introduction
.
''
said
*NL*
Albert
;
``
but
we
are
not
superstitious
.
M.
Morrel
,
allow
me
to
present
*NL*
to
you
M.
Franz
d'Epinay
,
a
delightful
travelling
companion
,
with
whom
*NL*
I
made
the
tour
of
Italy

My
dear
Franz
,
M.
Maximilian
Morrel
,
an
*NL*
excellent
friend
I
have
acquired
in
your
absence
,
and
whose
name
you
*NL*
will
hear
me
mention
every
time
I
make
any
allusion
to
affection
,
wit
,
*NL*
or
amiability
.
''
Morrel
hesitated
for
a
moment
;
he
feared
it
would
be
*NL*
hypocritical
to
accost
in
a
friendly
manner
the
man
whom
he
was
tacitly
*NL*
opposing
,
but
his
oath
and
the
gravity
of
the
circumstances
recurred
*NL*
to
his
memory
;
he
struggled
to
conceal
his
emotion
and
bowed
to
Franz
.
*NL*
``
Mademoiselle
de
Villefort
is
in
deep
sorrow
,
is
she
not
?
''
said
Debray
*NL*
to
Franz
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Extremely
,
''
replied
he
;
``
she
looked
so
pale
this
morning
,
I
scarcely
*NL*
knew
her
.
''
These
apparently
simple
words
pierced
Morrel
to
the
*NL*
heart
.
This
man
had
seen
Valentine
,
and
spoken
to
her
!
The
young
and
*NL*
high-spirited
officer
required
all
his
strength
of
mind
to
resist
*NL*
breaking
his
oath
.
He
took
the
arm
of
Chateau-Renaud
,
and
turned
towards
*NL*
the
vault
,
where
the
attendants
had
already
placed
the
two
coffins
.
*NL*
``
This
is
a
magnificent
habitation
,
''
said
Beauchamp
,
looking
towards
the
*NL*
mausoleum
;
``
a
summer
and
winter
palace
.
You
will
,
in
turn
,
enter
it
,
my
*NL*
dear
d'Epinay
,
for
you
will
soon
be
numbered
as
one
of
the
family
.
I
,
as
*NL*
a
philosopher
,
should
like
a
little
country-house
,
a
cottage
down
there
*NL*
under
the
trees
,
without
so
many
free-stones
over
my
poor
body
.
In
*NL*
dying
,
I
will
say
to
those
around
me
what
Voltaire
wrote
to
Piron
:
`
Eo
*NL*
rus
,
and
all
will
be
over
.
'
But
come
,
Franz
,
take
courage
,
your
wife
is
*NL*
an
heiress
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
Beauchamp
,
you
are
unbearable
.
Politics
has
made
you
laugh
at
*NL*
everything
,
and
political
men
have
made
you
disbelieve
everything
.
*NL*
But
when
you
have
the
honor
of
associating
with
ordinary
men
,
and
the
*NL*
pleasure
of
leaving
politics
for
a
moment
,
try
to
find
your
affectionate
*NL*
heart
,
which
you
leave
with
your
stick
when
you
go
to
the
Chamber
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
tell
me
,
''
said
Beauchamp
,
``
what
is
life
?
Is
it
not
a
hall
in
*NL*
Death
's
anteroom
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
prejudiced
against
Beauchamp
,
''
said
Albert
,
drawing
Franz
away
,
*NL*
and
leaving
the
former
to
finish
his
philosophical
dissertation
with
*NL*
Debray
.
The
Villefort
vault
formed
a
square
of
white
stones
,
about
*NL*
twenty
feet
high
;
an
interior
partition
separated
the
two
families
,
and
*NL*
each
apartment
had
its
entrance
door
.
Here
were
not
,
as
in
other
tombs
,
*NL*
ignoble
drawers
,
one
above
another
,
where
thrift
bestows
its
dead
and
*NL*
labels
them
like
specimens
in
a
museum
;
all
that
was
visible
within
the
*NL*
bronze
gates
was
a
gloomy-looking
room
,
separated
by
a
wall
from
the
*NL*
vault
itself
.
The
two
doors
before
mentioned
were
in
the
middle
of
this
*NL*
wall
,
and
enclosed
the
Villefort
and
Saint-Meran
coffins
.
There
grief
*NL*
might
freely
expend
itself
without
being
disturbed
by
the
trifling
*NL*
loungers
who
came
from
a
picnic
party
to
visit
Pere-la-Chaise
,
or
by
*NL*
lovers
who
make
it
their
rendezvous
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
coffins
were
placed
on
trestles
previously
prepared
for
their
*NL*
reception
in
the
right-hand
crypt
belonging
to
the
Saint-Meran
family
.
*NL*
Villefort
,
Franz
,
and
a
few
near
relatives
alone
entered
the
sanctuary
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
religious
ceremonies
had
all
been
performed
at
the
door
,
and
*NL*
there
was
no
address
given
,
the
party
all
separated
;
Chateau-Renaud
,
*NL*
Albert
,
and
Morrel
,
went
one
way
,
and
Debray
and
Beauchamp
the
other
.
*NL*
Franz
remained
with
M.
de
Villefort
;
at
the
gate
of
the
cemetery
,
Morrel
*NL*
made
an
excuse
to
wait
;
he
saw
Franz
and
M.
de
Villefort
get
into
the
*NL*
same
mourning
coach
,
and
thought
this
meeting
forboded
evil
.
He
then
*NL*
returned
to
Paris
,
and
although
in
the
same
carriage
with
Chateau-Renaud
*NL*
and
Albert
,
he
did
not
hear
one
word
of
their
conversation
.
As
Franz
was
*NL*
about
to
take
leave
of
M.
de
Villefort
,
``
When
shall
I
see
you
again
?
''
*NL*
said
the
latter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
what
time
you
please
,
sir
,
''
replied
Franz
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
soon
as
possible

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I

shall
we
return
together
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
not
unpleasant
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
contrary
,
I
shall
feel
much
pleasure
.
''
Thus
,
the
future
father
*NL*
and
son-in-law
stepped
into
the
same
carriage
,
and
Morrel
,
seeing
*NL*
them
pass
,
became
uneasy
.
Villefort
and
Franz
returned
to
the
Faubourg
*NL*
Saint-Honore
.
The
procureur
,
without
going
to
see
either
his
wife
or
*NL*
his
daughter
,
went
at
once
to
his
study
,
and
,
offering
the
young
man
*NL*
a
chair
,
--
``
M.
d'Epinay
,
''
said
he
,
``
allow
me
to
remind
you
at
this
*NL*
moment
,
--
which
is
perhaps
not
so
ill-chosen
as
at
first
sight
may
*NL*
appear
,
for
obedience
to
the
wishes
of
the
departed
is
the
first
*NL*
offering
which
should
be
made
at
their
tomb
,
--
allow
me
then
to
remind
*NL*
you
of
the
wish
expressed
by
Madame
de
Saint-Meran
on
her
death-bed
,
*NL*
that
Valentine
's
wedding
might
not
be
deferred
.
You
know
the
affairs
of
*NL*
the
deceased
are
in
perfect
order
,
and
her
will
bequeaths
to
Valentine
*NL*
the
entire
property
of
the
Saint-Meran
family
;
the
notary
showed
me
*NL*
the
documents
yesterday
,
which
will
enable
us
to
draw
up
the
contract
*NL*
immediately
.
You
may
call
on
the
notary
,
M.
Deschamps
,
Place
Beauveau
,
*NL*
Faubourg
Saint-Honore
,
and
you
have
my
authority
to
inspect
those
*NL*
deeds
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
,
''
replied
M.
d'Epinay
,
``
it
is
not
,
perhaps
,
the
moment
for
*NL*
Mademoiselle
Valentine
,
who
is
in
deep
distress
,
to
think
of
a
husband
;
*NL*
indeed
,
I
fear
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Valentine
will
have
no
greater
pleasure
than
that
of
fulfilling
her
*NL*
grandmother
's
last
injunctions
;
there
will
be
no
obstacle
from
that
*NL*
quarter
,
I
assure
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
that
case
,
''
replied
Franz
,
``
as
I
shall
raise
none
,
you
may
make
*NL*
arrangements
when
you
please
;
I
have
pledged
my
word
,
and
shall
feel
*NL*
pleasure
and
happiness
in
adhering
to
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
''
said
Villefort
,
``
nothing
further
is
required
.
The
contract
was
*NL*
to
have
been
signed
three
days
since
;
we
shall
find
it
all
ready
,
and
*NL*
can
sign
it
to-day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
the
mourning
?
''
said
Franz
,
hesitating
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
be
uneasy
on
that
score
,
''
replied
Villefort
;
``
no
ceremony
will
be
*NL*
neglected
in
my
house
.
Mademoiselle
de
Villefort
may
retire
during
the
*NL*
prescribed
three
months
to
her
estate
of
Saint-Meran
;
I
say
hers
,
for
*NL*
she
inherits
it
to-day
.
There
,
after
a
few
days
,
if
you
like
,
the
*NL*
civil
marriage
shall
be
celebrated
without
pomp
or
ceremony
.
Madame
de
*NL*
Saint-Meran
wished
her
daughter
should
be
married
there
.
When
that
is
*NL*
over
,
you
,
sir
,
can
return
to
Paris
,
while
your
wife
passes
the
time
of
*NL*
her
mourning
with
her
mother-in-law
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
you
please

''
said
Franz
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
''
replied
M.
de
Villefort
,
``
have
the
kindness

wait
half
an

come
down
into

will
send
for

M.
Deschamps
;
we
will
read
and
sign
the
contract
before
we
separate
,
*NL*
and
this
evening
Madame

Villefort
shall
accompany
Valentine
to
her
*NL*
estate
,
where
we
will
rejoin
them
in
a
week
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
,
''
said
Franz
,
``
I
have
one
request
to
make
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
Albert
de
Morcerf
and
Raoul
de
Chateau-Renaud
to
be
present
at

this
signature

know
they
are
my
witnesses
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Half
an
hour
will
suffice
to
apprise

;
will
you
go
for
them
*NL*
yourself
,
or
shall
you
send
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
prefer
going
,
sir

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
expect
you
,
then
,
in
half
an
hour
,
baron

and
Valentine
will
*NL*
be
ready
.
''
Franz
bowed
and
left
the
room
.
Scarcely
had
the
door
*NL*
closed
,
when
M.
de
Villefort
sent
to
tell
Valentine
to
be
ready
in
the
*NL*
drawing-room
in
half
an
hour
,
as
he
expected
the
notary
and
M.
d'Epinay
*NL*
and
his
witnesses
.
The
news
caused
a
great
sensation
throughout
the
*NL*
house
;
Madame
de
Villefort
would
not
believe
it
,
and
Valentine
was
*NL*
thunderstruck
.
She
looked
around
for
help
,
and
would
have
gone
down
to
*NL*
her
grandfather
's
room
,
but
on
the
stairs
she
met
M.
de
Villefort
,
*NL*
who
took
her
arm
and
led
her
into
the
drawing-room
.
In
the
anteroom
,
*NL*
Valentine
met
Barrois
,
and
looked
despairingly
at
the
old
servant
.
A
*NL*
moment
later
,
Madame
de
Villefort
entered
the
drawing-room
with
her
*NL*
little
Edward
.
It
was
evident
that
she
had
shared
the
grief
of
the
*NL*
family
,
for
she
was
pale
and
looked
fatigued
.
She
sat
down
,
took
Edward
*NL*
on
her
knees
,
and
from
time
to
time
pressed
this
child
,
on
whom
her
*NL*
affections
appeared
centred
,
almost
convulsively
to
her
bosom
.
Two
*NL*
carriages
were
soon
heard
to
enter
the
court
yard
.
One
was
the
notary
's
;
*NL*
the
other
,
that
of
Franz
and
his
friends
.
In
a
moment
the
whole
party
*NL*
was
assembled
.
Valentine
was
so
pale
one
might
trace
the
blue
veins
*NL*
from
her
temples
,
round
her
eyes
and
down
her
cheeks
.
Franz
was
deeply
*NL*
affected
.
Chateau-Renaud
and
Albert
looked
at
each
other
with
amazement
;
*NL*
the
ceremony
which
was
just
concluded
had
not
appeared
more
sorrowful
*NL*
than
did
that
which
was
about
to
begin
.
Madame
de
Villefort
had
placed
*NL*
herself
in
the
shadow
behind
a
velvet
curtain
,
and
as
she
constantly
*NL*
bent
over
her
child
,
it
was
difficult
to
read
the
expression
of
her
*NL*
face
.
M.
de
Villefort
was
,
as
usual
,
unmoved
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
notary
,
after
having
according
to
the
customary
method
arranged
*NL*
the
papers
on
the
table
,
taken
his
place
in
an
armchair
,
and
raised
his
*NL*
spectacles
,
turned
towards
Franz
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
M.
Franz
de
Quesnel
,
baron
d'Epinay
?
''
asked
he
,
although
he
*NL*
knew
it
perfectly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
,
''
replied
Franz
.
The
notary
bowed
.
``
I
have
,
then
,
to
inform
*NL*
you
,
sir
,
at
the
request
of
M.
de
Villefort
,
that
your
projected
*NL*
marriage
with
Mademoiselle
de
Villefort
has
changed
the
feeling
of
M.
*NL*
Noirtier
towards
his
grandchild
,
and
that
he
disinherits
her
entirely
of
*NL*
the
fortune
he
would
have
left
her
.
Let
me
hasten
to
add
,
''
continued
*NL*
he
,
``
that
the
testator
,
having
only
the
right
to
alienate
a
part
of
his
*NL*
fortune
,
and
having
alienated
it
all
,
the
will
will
not
bear
scrutiny
,
*NL*
and
is
declared
null
and
void
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
said
Villefort
;
``
but
I
warn
M.
d'Epinay
,
that
during
my
life-time
*NL*
my
father
's
will
shall
never
be
questioned
,
my
position
forbidding
any
*NL*
doubt
to
be
entertained
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
,
''
said
Franz
,
``
I
regret
much
that
such
a
question
has
been
raised
*NL*
in
the
presence
of
Mademoiselle
Valentine
;
I
have
never
inquired
the
*NL*
amount
of
her
fortune
,
which
,
however
limited
it
may
be
,
exceeds
*NL*
mine
.
My
family
has
sought
consideration
in
this
alliance
with
M.
de
*NL*
Villefort
;
all
I
seek
is
happiness
.
''
Valentine
imperceptibly
thanked
*NL*
him
,
while
two
silent
tears
rolled
down
her
cheeks
.
``
Besides
,
sir
,
''
said
*NL*
Villefort
,
addressing
himself
to
his
future
son-in-law
,
``
excepting
*NL*
the
loss
of
a
portion
of
your
hopes
,
this
unexpected
will
need
not
*NL*
personally
wound
you
;
M.
Noirtier
's
weakness
of
mind
sufficiently
*NL*
explains
it
.
It
is
not
because
Mademoiselle
Valentine
is
going
to
marry
*NL*
you
that
he
is
angry
,
but
because
she
will
marry
,
a
union
with
any
other
*NL*
would
have
caused
him
the
same
sorrow
.
Old
age
is
selfish
,
sir
,
and
*NL*
Mademoiselle
de
Villefort
has
been
a
faithful
companion
to
M.
Noirtier
,
*NL*
which
she
can
not
be
when
she
becomes
the
Baroness
d'Epinay
.
My
father
's
*NL*
melancholy
state
prevents
our
speaking
to
him
on
any
subjects
,
which
the
*NL*
weakness
of
his
mind
would
incapacitate
him
from
understanding
,
and
I
*NL*
am
perfectly
convinced
that
at
the
present
time
,
although
,
he
knows
that
*NL*
his
granddaughter
is
going
to
be
married
,
M.
Noirtier
has
even
forgotten
*NL*
the
name
of
his
intended
grandson
.
''
M.
de
Villefort
had
scarcely
said
*NL*
this
,
when
the
door
opened
,
and
Barrois
appeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gentlemen
,
''
said
he
,
in
a
tone
strangely
firm
for
a
servant
speaking
to
*NL*
his
masters
under
such
solemn
circumstances
,
--
``
gentlemen
,
M.
Noirtier
*NL*
de
Villefort
wishes
to
speak
immediately
to
M.
Franz
de
Quesnel

d'Epinay
;
''
he
,
as
well
as
the
notary
,
that
there
might
be
no
mistake
in
*NL*
the
person
,
gave
all
his
titles
to
the
bride-groom
elect
.
*NL*
*NL*
Villefort
started
,
Madame
de
Villefort
let
her
son
slip
from
her
knees
,
*NL*
Valentine
rose
,
pale
and
dumb
as
a
statue
.
Albert
and
Chateau-Renaud
*NL*
exchanged
a
second
look
,
more
full
of
amazement
than
the
first
.
The
*NL*
notary
looked
at
Villefort
.
``
It
is
impossible
,
''
said
the
procureur
.
``
M.
*NL*
d'Epinay
can
not
leave
the
drawing-room
at
present
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
at
this
moment

replied
Barrois
with
the
same
firmness
,
``
that
M.

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Grandpapa
Noirtier
can
speak
now

said
Edward
,
with
his
habitual
*NL*
quickness
.
However
,
his
remark
did
not
make
Madame
de
Villefort
even
*NL*
smile
,
so
much
was
every
mind
engaged
,
and
so
solemn
was
the
situation
.
*NL*
Astonishment
was
at
its
height
.
Something
like
a
smile
was
perceptible
*NL*
on
Madame
de
Villefort
's
countenance
.
Valentine
instinctively
raised
her
*NL*
eyes
,
as
if
to
thank
heaven
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pray
go
,
Valentine
,
''
said
;
M.
de
Villefort
,
``
and
see
what
this
new
*NL*
fancy
of
your
grandfather

is

''
Valentine
rose
quickly
,
and
was
*NL*
hastening
joyfully
towards
the
door
,
when
M.
de
Villefort
altered
his
*NL*
intention
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stop
,
''
said
he
;
``
I
will
go
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excuse
me
,

said
Franz
,
``
since

sent
for

I
am
ready

shall
be
happy

*NL*
*NL*
``

Villefort
with
marked
uneasiness
,
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
Forgive

said
Franz
in
a
resolute
tone
.
``
I

how
wrong
it

encourage
feelings

which
I
am
determined
to
conquer
,
*NL*
whatever
they
may
be

by
my
devotion

''
And
without
listening
to
*NL*
Villefort
he
arose
,
and
followed
Valentine
,
who
was
running
down-stairs
*NL*
with
the
joy
of
a
shipwrecked
mariner
who
finds
a
rock
to
cling
to
.
M.
*NL*
de
Villefort
followed
them
.
Chateau-Renaud
and
Morcerf
exchanged
a
third
*NL*
look

still
increasing
wonder

A
Signed
Statement

*NL*
*NL*
Noirtier
was
prepared
to
receive
them
,
dressed
in
black
,
and
installed
*NL*
in
his
arm-chair
.
When
the
three
persons
he
expected
had
entered
,
he
*NL*
looked
at
the
door
,
which
his
valet
immediately
closed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
,
''
whispered
Villefort
to
Valentine
,
who
could
not
conceal
her
*NL*
joy
;
``
if
M.
Noirtier
wishes
to
communicate
anything
which
would
delay

I
forbid
you
to

Valentine
blushed
,
*NL*
but
did
not
answer
.
Villefort
,
approaching
Noirtier
--
``
Here
is
M.
Franz
*NL*
d'Epinay

''
said
he
;
``
you
requested
to
see
him

We
have
all
wished
for
*NL*
this
interview
,
and
I
trust
it
will
convince
you
how
ill-formed
are
your
*NL*
objections
to
Valentine
's
marriage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Noirtier
answered
only
by
a
look
which
made
Villefort
's
blood
run
cold
.
*NL*
He
motioned
to
Valentine
to
approach
.
In
a
moment
,
thanks
to
her
habit
*NL*
of
conversing
with
her
grandfather
,
she
understood
that
he
asked
for
a
*NL*
key
.
Then
his
eye
was
fixed
on
the
drawer
of
a
small
chest
between
the
*NL*
windows
.
She
opened
the
drawer
,
and
found
a
key
;
and
,
understanding
that
*NL*
was
what
he
wanted
,
again
watched
his
eyes
,
which
turned
toward
an
old
*NL*
secretary
which
had
been
neglected
for
many
years
and
was
supposed
to
*NL*
contain
nothing
but
useless
documents
.
``
Shall
I
open
the
secretary
?
''
*NL*
asked
Valentine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

said
the
old
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And

``
Yes

stopped

opened

found
the

went
to

Villefort
's
impatience
*NL*
during
this
scene
made
the
perspiration
roll
from
his
forehead
,
and
*NL*
Franz
was
stupefied
.
The
old

came
.
``

said
Valentine
,
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
Barrois
looked
at
the

.
``
Obey

said
Noirtier
's
intelligent
eye
.
*NL*
Barrois
touched
a
spring
,
the
false
bottom
came
out
,
and
they
saw
a

bundle
of
papers
tied
with
a
black
string
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

Villefort

Franz
before
him

the

Valentine

on

General

who

was
supposed

to

notwithstanding
the
title

with

A
note
was
in
consequence
addressed
to
General
de
Quesnel
,
begging
*NL*
him
to
be
present
at
the
meeting
next
day
,
the
5th
.
The
note
indicated
*NL*
neither
the
street
nor
the
number
of
the
house
where
the
meeting
was
to
*NL*
be
held
;
it
bore
no
signature
,
but
it
announced
to
the
general
that
*NL*
some
one
would
call
for
him
if
he
would
be
ready
at
nine
o'clock
.
The
*NL*
meetings
were
always
held
from
that
time
till
midnight
.
At
nine
o'clock
*NL*
the
president
of
the
club
presented
himself
;
the
general
was
ready
,
the
*NL*
president
informed
him
that
one
of
the
conditions
of
his
introduction
*NL*
was
that
he
should
be
eternally
ignorant
of
the
place
of
meeting
,
and
*NL*
that
he
would
allow
his
eyes
to
be
bandaged
,
swearing
that
he
would
*NL*
not
endeavor
to
take
off
the
bandage
.
General
de
Quesnel
accepted
the
*NL*
condition
,
and
promised
on
his
honor
not
to
seek
to
discover
the
road
*NL*
they
took
.
The
general
's
carriage
was
ready
,
but
the
president
told
him
*NL*
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
use
it
,
since
it
was
useless
to
blindfold
*NL*
the
master
if
the
coachman
knew
through
what
streets
he
went
.
``
What
must
*NL*
be
done
then
?
''
asked
the
general
.
--
``
I
have
my
carriage
here
,
''
said
the
*NL*
president
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
'
``
Have
you
,
then
,
so
much
confidence
in
your
servant
that
you
can
*NL*
intrust
him
with
a
secret
you
will
not
allow
me
to
know
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
'
``
Our
coachman
is
a
member
of
the
club
,
''
said
the
president
;
``
we
shall
*NL*
be
driven
by
a
State-Councillor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
'
``
Then
we
run
another
risk
,
''
said
the
general
,
laughing
,
``
that
of
being
*NL*
upset
.
''
We
insert
this
joke
to
prove
that
the
general
was
not
in
the
*NL*
least
compelled
to
attend
the
meeting
,
but
that
he
came
willingly
.
When
*NL*
they
were
seated
in
the
carriage
the
president
reminded
the
general
*NL*
of
his
promise
to
allow
his
eyes
to
be
bandaged
,
to
which
he
made
no
*NL*
opposition
.
On
the
road
the
president
thought
he
saw
the
general
make
an
*NL*
attempt
to
remove
the
handkerchief
,
and
reminded
him
of
his
oath
.
``
Sure
*NL*
enough
,
''
said
the
general
.
The
carriage
stopped
at
an
alley
leading
out
*NL*
of
the
Rue
Saint-Jacques
.
The
general
alighted
,
leaning
on
the
arm
of
*NL*
the
president
,
of
whose
dignity
he
was
not
aware
,
considering
him
simply
*NL*
as
a
member
of
the
club
;
they
went
through
the
alley
,
mounted
a
flight
*NL*
of
stairs
,
and
entered
the
assembly-room
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
The
deliberations
had
already
begun
.
The
members
,
apprised
of
the
*NL*
sort
of
presentation
which
was
to
be
made
that
evening
,
were
all
in
*NL*
attendance
.
When
in
the
middle
of
the
room
the
general
was
invited
to
*NL*
remove
his
bandage
,
he
did
so
immediately
,
and
was
surprised
to
see
so
*NL*
many
well-known
faces
in
a
society
of
whose
existence
he
had
till
*NL*
then
been
ignorant
.
They
questioned
him
as
to
his
sentiments
,
but
he
*NL*
contented
himself
with
answering
,
that
the
letters
from
the
Island
of
*NL*
Elba
ought
to
have
informed
them
'
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
Franz
interrupted
himself
by
saying
,
``
My
father
was
a
royalist
;
they
*NL*
need
not
have
asked
his
sentiments
,
which
were
well
known
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
hence
,
''
said
Villefort
,
``
arose
my
affection
for
your
father
,
my
*NL*
dear
M.
Franz
.
Opinions
held
in
common
are
a
ready
bond
of
union

*NL*
*NL*
``
Read

said
the
old
man
.
Franz
continued
:

*NL*
''
`
The
president
then
sought
to
make
him
speak
more
explicitly
,
but
M.
de
*NL*
Quesnel
replied
that
he
wished
first
to
know
what
they
wanted
with
him
.
*NL*
He
was
then
informed
of
the
contents
of
the
letter
from
the
Island
of
*NL*
Elba
,
in
which
he
was
recommended
to
the
club
as
a
man
who
would
be
*NL*
likely
to
advance
the
interests
of
their
party
.
One
paragraph
spoke
of
*NL*
the
return
of
Bonaparte
and
promised
another
letter
and
further
details
,
*NL*
on
the
arrival
of
the
Pharaon
belonging
to
the
shipbuilder
Morrel
,
of
*NL*
Marseilles
,
whose
captain
was
entirely
devoted
to
the
emperor
.
During
*NL*
all
this
time
,
the
general
,
on
whom
they
thought
to
have
relied
as
on
a
*NL*
brother
,
manifested
evidently
signs
of
discontent
and
repugnance
.
When
*NL*
the
reading
was
finished
,
he
remained
silent
,
with
knitted
brows
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
'
``
Well

asked
the
president
,
``
what
do
you
say
to
this
letter

*NL*
general

''
*NL*
*NL*
''
'
``
I
say
that
it
is
too
soon
after
declaring
myself
for
Louis
XVIII
.
to
*NL*
break
my
vow
in
behalf
of
the
ex-emperor
.
''
This
answer
was
too
clear
*NL*
to
permit
of
any
mistake
as
to
his
sentiments
.
``
General

said
the
*NL*
president
,
``
we
acknowledge
no

violence

treason

``
Excuse

said
the
general
;

may
not

I
do

as
he
has
made
me
a
baron

a
field-marshal

*NL*
and
I
shall
never
forget
that
for
these
two
titles
I
am
indebted

*NL*
happy
return

France

``
Sir

said
the
president
,
rising
with
gravity
,
``
be
careful

clearly
show
us

Island

deceived

discover

not

would
call

Franz

interrupting
himself

Valentine
could
not
help
casting
one
glance
towards
*NL*
the
young
man
,
whose
filial
enthusiasm
it
was
delightful
to
behold

*NL*
Villefort
walked
to
and
fro
behind
them
.
Noirtier
watched
the
expression
*NL*
of
each
one
,
and
preserved
his
dignified
and
commanding
attitude
.
Franz
*NL*
returned
to
the
manuscript
,
and
continued
:

come

blindfolded

you
accepted

When
you
complied
with
this
twofold
request
*NL*
you
well
knew
we
did
not
wish
to
secure
the
throne
of
Louis

or
*NL*
we
should
not
take
so
much
care
to
avoid
the
vigilance

It

would
be
conceding
too
much
to
allow
you
to
put
on
a
mask
to
aid
you

in
the
discovery
of

secret

then
to
remove
it
that
you
may

ruin

These
words
were
*NL*
followed
by
a
general
murmur
,

it
was
evident
that
several
of

were
discussing

rashness

The

again
arose

having
imposed
silence

said

exclaimed

,
sir
,
''
continued
the
president
,
with
a
calmness
still
more
*NL*
terrible
than
the
general
's
anger
,
``
I
advise
you
not
to
touch
your
*NL*
sword
.
''
The
general
looked
around
him
with
slight
uneasiness
;
however
*NL*
he
did
not
yield
,
but
calling
up
all
his
fortitude
,
said
,
--
``
I
will
not
*NL*
swear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
'
``
Then
you
must
die
,
''
replied
the
president
calmly
.
M.
d'Epinay
became
*NL*
very
pale
;
he
looked
round
him
a
second
time
,
several
members
of
the
*NL*
club
were
whispering
,
and
getting
their
arms
from
under
their
cloaks
.
*NL*
``
General
,
''
said
the
president
,
``
do
not
alarm
yourself
;
you
are
among
men
*NL*
of
honor
who
will
use
every
means
to
convince
you
before
resorting
to
*NL*
the
last
extremity
,
but
as
you
have
said
,
you
are
among
conspirators
,
*NL*
you
are
in
possession
of
our
secret
,
and
you
must
restore
it
to
us
.
''
*NL*
A
significant
silence
followed
these
words
,
and
as
the
general
did
not
*NL*
reply
,
--
``
Close
the
doors
,
''
said
the
president
to
the
door-keeper
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
The
same
deadly
silence
succeeded
these
words
.
Then
the
general
*NL*
advanced
,
and
making
a
violent
effort
to
control
his
feelings
,
--
``
I
have
*NL*
a
son
,
''
said
he
,
``
and
I
ought
to
think
of
him
,
finding
myself
among
*NL*
assassins
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
'
``
General
,
''
said
the
chief
of
the
assembly
,
``
one
man
may
insult
*NL*
fifty
--
it
is
the
privilege
of
weakness
.
But
he
does
wrong
to
use
his
*NL*
privilege
.
Follow
my
advice
,
swear
,
and
do
not
insult
.
''
The
general
,
*NL*
again
daunted
by
the
superiority
of
the
chief
,
hesitated
a
moment
;
then
*NL*
advancing
to
the
president
's
desk
,
--
``
What
is
the
form
,
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
'
``
It
is
this
:
--
'
I
swear
by
my
honor
not
to
reveal
to
any
one
what
I
*NL*
have
seen
and
heard
on
the
5th
of
February
,
1815
,
between
nine
and
*NL*
ten
o'clock
in
the
evening
;
and
I
plead
guilty
of
death
should
I
ever
*NL*
violate
this
oath
.
'
''
The
general
appeared
to
be
affected
by
a
nervous
*NL*
tremor
,
which
prevented
his
answering
for
some
moments
;
then
,
overcoming
*NL*
his
manifest
repugnance
,
he
pronounced
the
required
oath
,
but
in
so
low
*NL*
a
tone
as
to
be
scarcely
audible
to
the
majority
of
the
members
,
who
*NL*
insisted
on
his
repeating
it
clearly
and
distinctly
,
which
he
did
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
'
``
Now
am
I
at
liberty
to
retire
?
''
said
the
general
.
The
president
rose
,
*NL*
appointed
three
members
to
accompany
him
,
and
got
into
the
carriage
with
*NL*
the
general
after
bandaging
his
eyes
.
One
of
those
three
members
was
*NL*
the
coachman
who
had
driven
them
there
.
The
other
members
*NL*
silently
dispersed
.
``
Where
do
you
wish
to
be
taken
?
''
asked
the
*NL*
president
.
--
``
Anywhere
out
of
your
presence
,
''
replied
M.
d'Epinay
.
*NL*
``
Beware
,
sir
,
''
replied
the
president
,
``
you
are
no
longer
in
the
*NL*
assembly
,
and
have
only
to
do
with
individuals
;
do
not
insult
them
*NL*
unless
you
wish
to
be
held
responsible
.
''
But
instead
of
listening
,
M.
*NL*
d'Epinay
went
on
,
--
``
You
are
still
as
brave
in
your
carriage
as
in
your
*NL*
assembly
because
you
are
still
four
against
one

''
The
president
stopped
*NL*
the
coach
.
They
were
at
that
part
of
the
Quai
des
Ormes
where
the
steps
*NL*
lead
down
to
the
river
.
``
Why
do
you
stop
here
?
''
asked
d'Epinay
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
'
``
Because
,
sir
,
''
said
the
president
,
``
you
have
insulted
a
man

*NL*
that

not

farther
without

reparation

''
*NL*
*NL*
''
'
``
Another
method
of
assassination
?

said
the
general
,
shrugging
his
*NL*
shoulders
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
'
``
Make
no
noise

*NL*
The
general
tore
the
handkerchief
from
his
eyes
.
``
At
last
,
''
said
he
,
``
I
*NL*
shall
know
with
whom
I
have

They
opened
the
door
and
the
four
*NL*
men
alighted
.

''
*NL*
*NL*
Franz
again
interrupted
himself
,
and
wiped
the
cold
drops
from
his
brow
;
*NL*
there
was
something
awful
in
hearing
the
son
read
aloud
in
trembling
*NL*
pallor
these
details
of
his
father
's
death
,
which
had
hitherto
been
a
*NL*
mystery
.
Valentine
clasped
her
hands
as
if
in
prayer
.
Noirtier
looked
at
*NL*
Villefort
with
an
almost
sublime
expression
of
contempt
and
pride
.
Franz
*NL*
continued
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
It
was
,
as
we
said
,
the
fifth
of
February
.
For
three
days
the
mercury
*NL*
had
been
five
or
six
degrees
below
freezing
and
the
steps
were
covered
*NL*
with
ice
.
The
general
was
stout
and
tall
,
the
president
offered
him
the
*NL*
side
of
the
railing
to
assist
him
in
getting
down
.
The
two
witnesses
*NL*
followed
.
It
was
a
dark
night
.
The
ground
from
the
steps
to
the
river
*NL*
was
covered
with
snow
and
hoarfrost
,
the
water
of
the
river
looked
black
*NL*
and
deep
.
One
of
the
seconds
went
for
a
lantern
in
a
coal-barge
near
,
*NL*
and
by
its
light
they
examined
the
weapons
.
The
president
's
sword
,
which
*NL*
was
simply
,
as
he
had
said
,
one
he
carried
in
his
cane
,
was
five
inches
*NL*
shorter
than
the
general
's
,
and
had
no
guard
.
The
general
proposed
to
*NL*
cast
lots
for
the
swords
,
but
the
president
said
it
was
he
who
had
given
*NL*
the
provocation
,
and
when
he
had
given
it
he
had
supposed
each
would
use
*NL*
his
own
arms
.
The
witnesses
endeavored
to
insist
,
but
the
president
*NL*
bade
them
be
silent
.
The
lantern
was
placed
on
the
ground
,
the
two
*NL*
adversaries
took
their
stations
,
and
the
duel
began
.
The
light
made
the
*NL*
two
swords
appear
like
flashes
of
lightning
;
as
for
the
men
,
they
were
*NL*
scarcely
perceptible
,
the
darkness
was
so
great
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
General
d'Epinay
passed
for
one
of
the
best
swordsmen
in
the
army
,
but
*NL*
he
was
pressed
so
closely
in
the
onset
that
he
missed
his
aim
and
fell
.
*NL*
The
witnesses
thought
he
was
dead
,
but
his
adversary
,
who
knew
he
had
*NL*
not
struck
him
,
offered
him
the
assistance
of
his
hand
to
rise
.
The
*NL*
circumstance
irritated
instead
of
calming
the
general
,
and
he
rushed
on
*NL*
his
adversary
.
But
his
opponent
did
not
allow
his
guard
to
be
broken
.
*NL*
He
received
him
on
his
sword
and
three
times
the
general
drew
back
on
*NL*
finding
himself
too
closely
engaged
,
and
then
returned
to
the
charge
.
At
*NL*
the
third
he
fell
again
.
They
thought
he
slipped
,
as
at
first
,
and
the
*NL*
witnesses
,
seeing
he
did
not
move
,
approached
and
endeavored
to
raise
*NL*
him
,
but
the
one
who
passed
his
arm
around
the
body
found
it
was
*NL*
moistened
with
blood
.
The
general
,
who
had
almost
fainted
,
revived
.
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
said
he
,
``
they
have
sent
some
fencing-master
to
fight
with
me
.
''
*NL*
The
president
,
without
answering
,
approached
the
witness
who
held
the
*NL*
lantern
,
and
raising
his
sleeve
,
showed
him
two
wounds
he
had
received
*NL*
in
his
arm
;
then
opening
his
coat
,
and
unbuttoning
his
waistcoat
,
*NL*
displayed
his
side
,
pierced
with
a
third
wound
.
Still
he
had
not
even
*NL*
uttered
a
sigh
.
General
d'Epinay
died
five
minutes
after
.

''
*NL*
*NL*
Franz
read
these
last
words
in
a
voice
so
choked
that
they
were
hardly
*NL*
audible
,
and
then
stopped
,
passing
his
hand
over
his
eyes
as
if
to
*NL*
dispel
a
cloud
;
but
after
a
moment
's
silence
,
he
continued
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
The
president
went
up
the
steps
,
after
pushing
his
sword
into
his
*NL*
cane
;
a
track
of
blood
on
the
snow
marked
his
course
.
He
had
scarcely
*NL*
arrived
at
the
top
when
he
heard
a
heavy
splash
in
the
water
--
it
was
the
*NL*
general
's
body
,
which
the
witnesses
had
just
thrown
into
the
river
after
*NL*
ascertaining
that
he
was
dead
.
The
general
fell
,
then
,
in
a
loyal
duel
,
*NL*
and
not
in
ambush
as
it
might
have
been
reported
.
In
proof
of
this
we
*NL*
have
signed
this
paper
to
establish
the
truth
of
the
facts
,
lest
the
*NL*
moment
should
arrive
when
either
of
the
actors
in
this
terrible
scene
*NL*
should
be
accused
of
premeditated
murder
or
of
infringement
of
the

When
Franz
had
finished
reading
this
account
,
so
dreadful
for
a
*NL*
son
;
when
Valentine
,
pale
with
emotion
,
had
wiped
away
a
tear
;
when
*NL*
Villefort
,
trembling
,
and
crouched
in
a
corner
,
had
endeavored
to
lessen
*NL*
the
storm
by
supplicating
glances
at
the
implacable
old
man
,
--
``
Sir
,
''
*NL*
said
d'Epinay
to
Noirtier
,
``
since
you
are
well
acquainted
with
all
these

take
some
interest

you
have
only
manifested

it
hitherto

sorrow

not
one
final

satisfaction

know

Villefort
mechanically
felt
for
*NL*
the
handle
of
the
door
;
Valentine
,
who
understood
sooner
than
anyone
her
*NL*
grandfather
's
answer
,
and
who
had
often
seen
two
scars
upon
his
right
*NL*
arm
,
drew
back
a
few
steps
.
``
Mademoiselle

said
Franz
,
turning
towards
*NL*
Valentine
,
``
unite
your

Valentine
remained
dumb

motionless
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hold

said
Villefort
,
``

``

cried
Franz
:

Noirtier
*NL*
looked
at
the
dictionary

Franz
took
it
with
a
nervous
trembling
,
and
*NL*
repeated
the
letters
of
the
alphabet
successively
,
until
he
came
to
M

At
that
letter
the
old
man
signified
``

``

repeated
Franz

The
young
man
's
finger
,
glided
over
the
words
,
but
*NL*
at
each
one
Noirtier
answered
by
a
negative
sign

Valentine
hid
her
head
*NL*
between
her
hands

At
length
,
Franz
arrived
at
the
word
MYSELF

*NL*
*NL*
``

``

Franz

fell
powerless
on
a
chair
;
Villefort
opened

escaped

the

Progress
of
Cavalcanti
the
Younger
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
M.
Cavalcanti
the
elder
had
returned
to
his
service
,
not
in
*NL*
the
army
of
his
majesty
the
Emperor
of
Austria
,
but
at
the
gaming-table
*NL*
of
the
baths
of
Lucca
,
of
which
he
was
one
of
the
most
assiduous
*NL*
courtiers
.
He
had
spent
every
farthing
that
had
been
allowed
for
his
*NL*
journey
as
a
reward
for
the
majestic
and
solemn
manner
in
which
he
had
*NL*
maintained
his
assumed
character
of
father
.
M.
Andrea
at
his
departure
*NL*
inherited
all
the
papers
which
proved
that
he
had
indeed
the
honor
*NL*
of
being
the
son
of
the
Marquis
Bartolomeo
and
the
Marchioness
Oliva
*NL*
Corsinari
.
He
was
now
fairly
launched
in
that
Parisian
society
which
*NL*
gives
such
ready
access
to
foreigners
,
and
treats
them
,
not
as
they
*NL*
really
are
,
but
as
they
wish
to
be
considered
.
Besides
,
what
is
required
*NL*
of
a
young
man
in
Paris
?
To
speak
its
language
tolerably
,
to
make
a
*NL*
good
appearance
,
to
be
a
good
gamester
,
and
to
pay
in
cash
.
They
are
*NL*
certainly
less
particular
with
a
foreigner
than
with
a
Frenchman
.
Andrea
*NL*
had
,
then
,
in
a
fortnight
,
attained
a
very
fair
position
.
He
was
called
*NL*
count
,
he
was
said
to
possess
50,000
livres
per
annum
;
and
his
father
's
*NL*
immense
riches
,
buried
in
the
quarries
of
Saravezza
,
were
a
constant
*NL*
theme
.
A
learned
man
,
before
whom
the
last
circumstance
was
mentioned
as
*NL*
a
fact
,
declared
he
had
seen
the
quarries
in
question
,
which
gave
great
*NL*
weight
to
assertions
hitherto
somewhat
doubtful
,
but
which
now
assumed
*NL*
the
garb
of
reality
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
was
the
state
of
society
in
Paris
at
the
period
we
bring
before
our
*NL*
readers
,
when
Monte
Cristo
went
one
evening
to
pay
M.
Danglars
a
visit
.
*NL*
M.
Danglars
was
out
,
but
the
count
was
asked
to
go
and
see
the
baroness
,
*NL*
and
he
accepted
the
invitation
.
It
was
never
without
a
nervous
shudder
,
*NL*
since
the
dinner
at
Auteuil
,
and
the
events
which
followed
it
,
that
*NL*
Madame
Danglars
heard
Monte
Cristo
's
name
announced
.
If
he
did
not
*NL*
come
,
the
painful
sensation
became
most
intense
;
if
,
on
the
contrary
,
he
*NL*
appeared
,
his
noble
countenance
,
his
brilliant
eyes
,
his
amiability
,
*NL*
his
polite
attention
even
towards
Madame
Danglars
,
soon
dispelled
every
*NL*
impression
of
fear
.
It
appeared
impossible
to
the
baroness
that
a
man
of
*NL*
such
delightfully
pleasing
manners
should
entertain
evil
designs
against
*NL*
her
;
besides
,
the
most
corrupt
minds
only
suspect
evil
when
it
would
*NL*
answer
some
interested
end
--
useless
injury
is
repugnant
to
every
mind
.
*NL*
When
Monte
Cristo
entered
the
boudoir
,
--
to
which
we
have
already
once
*NL*
introduced
our
readers
,
and
where
the
baroness
was
examining
some
*NL*
drawings
,
which
her
daughter
passed
to
her
after
having
looked
at
them
*NL*
with
M.
Cavalcanti
,
--
his
presence
soon
produced
its
usual
effect
,
and
it
*NL*
was
with
smiles
that
the
baroness
received
the
count
,
although
she
had
*NL*
been
a
little
disconcerted
at
the
announcement
of
his
name
.
The
latter
*NL*
took
in
the
whole
scene
at
a
glance
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
baroness
was
partially
reclining
on
a
sofa
,
Eugenie
sat
near
her
,
*NL*
and
Cavalcanti
was
standing
.
Cavalcanti
,
dressed
in
black
,
like
one
*NL*
of
Goethe
's
heroes
,
with
varnished
shoes
and
white
silk
open-worked
*NL*
stockings
,
passed
a
white
and
tolerably
nice-looking
hand
through
his
*NL*
light
hair
,
and
so
displayed
a
sparkling
diamond
,
that
in
spite
of
Monte
*NL*
Cristo
's
advice
the
vain
young
man
had
been
unable
to
resist
putting
on
*NL*
his
little
finger
.
This
movement
was
accompanied
by
killing
glances
*NL*
at
Mademoiselle
Danglars
,
and
by
sighs
launched
in
the
same
direction
.
*NL*
Mademoiselle
Danglars
was
still
the
same
--
cold
,
beautiful
,
and
*NL*
satirical
.
Not
one
of
these
glances
,
nor
one
sigh
,
was
lost
on
her
;
*NL*
they
might
have
been
said
to
fall
on
the
shield
of
Minerva
,
which
some
*NL*
philosophers
assert
protected
sometimes
the
breast
of
Sappho
.
Eugenie
*NL*
bowed
coldly
to
the
count
,
and
availed
herself
of
the
first
moment
when
*NL*
the
conversation
became
earnest
to
escape
to
her
study
,
whence
very
soon
*NL*
two
cheerful
and
noisy
voices
being
heard
in
connection
with
occasional
*NL*
notes
of
the
piano
assured
Monte
Cristo
that
Mademoiselle
Danglars
*NL*
preferred
to
his
society
and
to
that
of
M.
Cavalcanti
the
company
of
*NL*
Mademoiselle
Louise
d'Armilly
,
her
singing
teacher
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
then
,
especially
while
conversing
with
Madame
Danglars
,
and
*NL*
apparently
absorbed
by
the
charm
of
the
conversation
,
that
the
count
*NL*
noticed
M.
Andrea
Cavalcanti
's
solicitude
,
his
manner
of
listening
*NL*
to
the
music
at
the
door
he
dared
not
pass
,
and
of
manifesting
his
*NL*
admiration
.
The
banker
soon
returned
.
His
first
look
was
certainly
*NL*
directed
towards
Monte
Cristo
,
but
the
second
was
for
Andrea
.
As
for
his
*NL*
wife
,
he
bowed
to
her
,
as
some
husbands
do
to
their
wives
,
but
in
a
way
*NL*
that
bachelors
will
never
comprehend
,
until
a
very
extensive
code
is
*NL*
published
on
conjugal
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
not
the
ladies
invited
you
to
join
them
at
the
piano
?
''
said
*NL*
Danglars
to
Andrea
.
``
Alas
,
no
,
sir
,
''
replied
Andrea
with
a
sigh
,
still
*NL*
more
remarkable
than
the
former
ones
.
Danglars
immediately
advanced
*NL*
towards
the
door
and
opened
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
young
ladies
were
seen
seated
on
the
same
chair
,
at
the
piano
,
*NL*
accompanying
themselves
,
each
with
one
hand
,
a
fancy
to
which
they
had
*NL*
accustomed
themselves
,
and
performed
admirably
.
Mademoiselle
d'Armilly
,
*NL*
whom
they
then
perceived
through
the
open
doorway
,
formed
with
Eugenie
*NL*
one
of
the
tableaux
vivants
of
which
the
Germans
are
so
fond
.
She
was
*NL*
somewhat
beautiful
,
and
exquisitely
formed
--
a
little
fairy-like
figure
,
*NL*
with
large
curls
falling
on
her
neck
,
which
was
rather
too
long
,
as
*NL*
Perugino
sometimes
makes
his
Virgins
,
and
her
eyes
dull
from
fatigue
.
*NL*
She
was
said
to
have
a
weak
chest
,
and
like
Antonia
in
the
``
Cremona
*NL*
Violin
,
''
she
would
die
one
day
while
singing
.
Monte
Cristo
cast
one
*NL*
rapid
and
curious
glance
round
this
sanctum
;
it
was
the
first
time
he
*NL*
had
ever
seen
Mademoiselle
d'Armilly
,
of
whom
he
had
heard
much
.
``
Well
,
''
*NL*
said
the
banker
to
his
daughter
,
``
are
we
then
all
to
be
excluded
?
''
He
*NL*
then
led
the
young
man
into
the
study
,
and
either
by
chance
or
manoeuvre
*NL*
the
door
was
partially
closed
after
Andrea
,
so
that
from
the
place
where
*NL*
they
sat
neither
the
Count
nor
the
baroness
could
see
anything
;
but
as
*NL*
the
banker
had
accompanied
Andrea
,
Madame
Danglars
appeared
to
take
no
*NL*
notice
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
count
soon
heard
Andrea
's
voice
,
singing
a
Corsican
song
,
*NL*
accompanied
by
the
piano
.
While
the
count
smiled
at
hearing
this
song
,
*NL*
which
made
him
lose
sight
of
Andrea
in
the
recollection
of
Benedetto
,
*NL*
Madame
Danglars
was
boasting
to
Monte
Cristo
of
her
husband
's
strength
*NL*
of
mind
,
who
that
very
morning
had
lost
three
or
four
hundred
thousand
*NL*
francs
by
a
failure
at
Milan
.
The
praise
was
well
deserved
,
for
had
not
*NL*
the
count
heard
it
from
the
baroness
,
or
by
one
of
those
means
by
which
*NL*
he
knew
everything
,
the
baron
's
countenance
would
not
have
led
him
*NL*
to
suspect
it
.
``
Hem
,
''
thought
Monte
Cristo
,
``
he
begins
to
conceal
his
*NL*
losses
;
a
month
since
he
boasted
of
them
.
''
Then
aloud
,
--
``
Oh
,
madame
,
M.
*NL*
Danglars
is
so
skilful
,
he
will
soon
regain
at
the
Bourse
what
he
loses
*NL*
elsewhere
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
that
you
participate
in
a
prevalent
error
,
''
said
Madame
Danglars
.
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
said
Monte
Cristo
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
M.
Danglars
speculates
,
whereas
he
never
does
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Truly
,
madame
,
I
recollect
M.
Debray
told
me
--
apropos
,
what
is
become
*NL*
of
him
?
I
have
seen
nothing
of
him
the
last
three
or
four
days
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nor
I
,
''
said
Madame
Danglars
;
``
but
you
began
a
sentence
,
sir
,
and
did
*NL*
not
finish
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Which
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
M.
Debray
had
told
you
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
yes
;
he
told
me
it
was
you
who
sacrificed
to
the
demon
of
*NL*
speculation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
once
very
fond
of
it
,
but
I
do
not
indulge
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
are
wrong
,
madame
.
Fortune
is
precarious
;
and
if
I
were
*NL*
a
woman
and
fate
had
made
me
a
banker
's
wife
,
whatever
might
be
my
*NL*
confidence
in
my
husband
's
good
fortune
,
still
in
speculation

know
there
is
great
risk

Well

I
would
secure
for
myself
a
fortune

independent
of
him
,
even
if
I
acquired
it
by
placing
my
interests
in

hands
unknown
to
him

''
Madame
Danglars
blushed
,
in
spite
of
all
her
*NL*
efforts
.
``
Stay
,
''
said
Monte
Cristo
,
as
though
he
had
not
observed
her
*NL*
confusion
,
``
I
have
heard
of
a
lucky
hit
that
was
made
yesterday
on
the
*NL*
Neapolitan
bonds

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

really
we

long
enough
of

are

two

heard
how
fate
is
persecuting
the
poor
Villeforts

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
has
happened

said
the
count
,
simulating
total
ignorance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
the
Marquis

Saint-Meran

*NL*

Danglars
returned
at

moment

alone

said
the
baroness

the

Then

turning

said
Monte

much
claim

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

said
the

``
If

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
the

never

admitted

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
well
say

perchance

replied
the

;
``
for
he
comes
so

seldom

*NL*
*NL*
``

should

*NL*
``
He

At
his

ball
he
danced

once
with
Eugenie

and
M.
Cavalcanti
three
times

he
took
no
notice

of
it

''
The
valet
announced
the
Vicomte
Albert
de
Morcerf
.
The
baroness
*NL*
rose
hastily
,
and
was
going
into
the
study
,
when
Danglars
stopped
her
.
*NL*
``
Let
her
alone
,
''
said
he
.
She
looked
at
him
in
amazement
.
Monte
Cristo
*NL*
appeared
to
be
unconscious
of
what
passed
.
Albert
entered
,
looking
*NL*
very
handsome
and
in
high
spirits
.
He
bowed
politely
to
the
baroness
,
*NL*
familiarly
to
Danglars
,
and
affectionately
to
Monte
Cristo
.
Then
turning
*NL*
to
the
baroness
:
``
May
I
ask
how
Mademoiselle
Danglars
is
?
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
quite
well
,
''
replied
Danglars
quickly
;
``
she
is
at
the
piano
*NL*
with
M.
Cavalcanti
.
''
Albert
retained
his
calm
and
indifferent
manner
;
he
*NL*
might
feel
perhaps
annoyed
,
but
he
knew
Monte
Cristo
's
eye
was
on
him
.
*NL*
``
M.
Cavalcanti
has
a
fine
tenor
voice
,
''
said
he
,
``
and
Mademoiselle
*NL*
Eugenie
a
splendid
soprano
,
and
then
she
plays
the
piano
like
Thalberg
.
*NL*
The
concert
must
be
a
delightful
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
suit
each
other
remarkably
well
,
''
said
Danglars
.
Albert
appeared
*NL*
not
to
notice
this
remark
,
which
was
,
however
,
so
rude
that
Madame
*NL*
Danglars
blushed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
,
too
,
''
said
the
young
man
,
``
am
a
musician

at
least
,
my
masters
used
*NL*
to
tell
me
so
;
but
it
is
strange
that
my
voice
never
would
suit
any
*NL*
other
,
and
a
soprano
less
than
any

''
Danglars
smiled
,
and
seemed
to
say
,
*NL*
``
It
is
of
no
consequence

Then
,
hoping
doubtless
to
effect
his
*NL*
purpose
,
he
said
,
--
``
The
prince

universally
admired

.
You
were
not
of
the
party
,
M.
de
Morcerf
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
prince
?
''
asked
Albert
.
``
Prince
Cavalcanti
,
''
said
Danglars
,
who
*NL*
persisted
in
giving
the
young
man
that
title
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pardon
me
,
''
said
Albert
,
``
I
was
not
aware
that
he
was
a
prince
.
And
*NL*
Prince
Cavalcanti
sang
with
Mademoiselle
Eugenie
yesterday
?
It
must
have
*NL*
been
charming
,
indeed
.
I
regret
not
having
heard
them
.
But
I
was
unable
*NL*
to
accept
your
invitation
,
having
promised
to
accompany
my
mother
to
*NL*
a
German
concert
given
by
the
Baroness
of
Chateau-Renaud
.
''
This
was
*NL*
followed
by
rather
an
awkward
silence
.
``
May
I
also
be
allowed
,
''
said
*NL*
Morcerf
,
``
to
pay
my
respects
to
Mademoiselle
Danglars
?
''
``
Wait
a
moment
,
''
*NL*
said
the
banker
,
stopping
the
young
man
;
``
do
you
hear
that
delightful
*NL*
cavatina
?
Ta
,
ta
,
ta
,
ti
,
ta
,
ti
,
ta
,
ta
;
it
is
charming
,
let
them
*NL*
finish
--
one
moment
.
Bravo
,
bravi
,
brava
!
''
The
banker
was
enthusiastic
in
*NL*
his
applause
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
''
said
Albert
,
``
it
is
exquisite
;
it
is
impossible
to
understand
*NL*
the
music
of
his
country
better
than
Prince
Cavalcanti
does
.
You
said
*NL*
prince
,
did
you
not
?
But
he
can
easily
become
one
,
if
he
is
not
*NL*
already
;
it
is
no
uncommon
thing
in
Italy
.
But
to
return
to
the
charming
*NL*
musicians
--
you
should
give
us
a
treat
,
Danglars
,
without
telling
them
*NL*
there
is
a
stranger
.
Ask
them
to
sing
one
more
song
;
it
is
so
delightful
*NL*
to
hear
music
in
the
distance
,
when
the
musicians
are
unrestrained
by
*NL*
observation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Danglars
was
quite
annoyed
by
the
young
man
's
indifference
.
He
took
*NL*
Monte
Cristo
aside
.
``
What
do
you
think
of
our
lover
?
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
appears
cool
.
But
,
then
your
word
is
given
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
doubtless
I
have
promised
to
give
my
daughter
to
a
man
who
loves
*NL*
her
,
but
not
to
one
who
does
not
.
See
him
there
,
cold
as
marble
and
*NL*
proud
like
his
father
.
If
he
were
rich
,
if
he
had
Cavalcanti
's
fortune
,
*NL*
that
might
be
pardoned

consulted

she
has
good
taste

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,

said
Monte
Cristo
,
``
my
fondness
may
blind
me
,
but
I
assure
you
*NL*
I
consider
Morcerf
a
charming
young

will
render
your
daughter
*NL*
happy
and
will
sooner

later
attain
a
certain
amount
of
distinction

position
is
good

*NL*
*NL*
``
Hem

said
Danglars
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
you

*NL*
*NL*

The

*NL*

Now

I
beg
of

go
off

It
's
a
month
now

you
*NL*
have
been
thinking
of
this
marriage

you
must
see
that
it
throws
*NL*
some
responsibility
on

it

at

met
this
young

Cavalcanti

*NL*

Danglars
burst
out

laughing

said
he
;

that
happens

*NL*
*NL*

Then

*NL*
*NL*

find
out
that

*NL*
*NL*
``
At

will
scarcely
open

take

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

Danglars
;
then
turning

the
count

A
banker
must
,
you
know
,
be
a
slave
to
his
promise

And
Danglars
*NL*
sighed
as
M.
Cavalcanti
had
done
half
an
hour
before
.
``
Bravi

bravo

*NL*
brava
!

cried
Morcerf
,
parodying
the
banker
,
as
the
selection
came
to
an
*NL*
end
.
Danglars
began
to
look
suspiciously
at
Morcerf
,
when
some
one
came
*NL*
and
whispered
a
few
words
to
him
.
``
I
shall
soon
return
,
''
said
the
banker
*NL*
to
Monte
Cristo
;
``
wait
for
me
.
I
shall
,
perhaps
,
have
something
to
say
*NL*
to
you
.
''
And
he
went
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
baroness
took
advantage
of
her
husband
's
absence
to
push
open
the
*NL*
door
of
her
daughter
's
study
,
and
M.
Andrea
,
who
was
sitting
before
*NL*
the
piano
with
Mademoiselle
Eugenie
,
started
up
like
a
jack-in-the-box
.
*NL*
Albert
bowed
with
a
smile
to
Mademoiselle
Danglars
,
who
did
not
appear
*NL*
in
the
least
disturbed
,
and
returned
his
bow
with
her
usual
coolness
.
*NL*
Cavalcanti
was
evidently
embarrassed
;
he
bowed
to
Morcerf
,
who
replied
*NL*
with
the
most
impertinent
look
possible
.
Then
Albert
launched
out
in
*NL*
praise
of
Mademoiselle
Danglars
'
voice
,
and
on
his
regret
,
after
what
*NL*
he
had
just
heard
,
that
he
had
been
unable
to
be
present
the
previous
*NL*
evening
.
Cavalcanti
,
being
left
alone
,
turned
to
Monte
Cristo
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
''
said
Madame
Danglars
,
``
leave
music
and
compliments
,
and
let
us
*NL*
go
and
take
tea
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
Louise
,
''
said
Mademoiselle
Danglars
to
her
friend
.
They
passed
*NL*
into
the
next
drawing-room
,
where
tea
was
prepared
.
Just
as
they
were
*NL*
beginning
,
in
the
English
fashion
,
to
leave
the
spoons
in
their
cups
,
*NL*
the
door
again
opened
and
Danglars
entered
,
visibly
agitated
.
Monte
*NL*
Cristo
observed
it
particularly
,
and
by
a
look
asked
the
banker
for
*NL*
an
explanation
.
``
I
have
just
received
my
courier
from
Greece
,
''
said
*NL*
Danglars
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
yes
,
''
said
the
count
;
``
that
was
the
reason
of
your
running
away
*NL*
from
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
is
King
Otho
getting
on
?
''
asked
Albert
in
the
most
sprightly
tone
.
*NL*
Danglars
cast
another
suspicious
look
towards
him
without
answering
,
and
*NL*
Monte
Cristo
turned
away
to
conceal
the
expression
of
pity
which
*NL*
passed
over
his
features
,
but
which
was
gone
in
a
moment
.
``
We
shall
go
*NL*
together
,
shall
we
not
?
''
said
Albert
to
the
count
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
like
,
''
replied
the
latter
.
Albert
could
not
understand
*NL*
the
banker
's
look
,
and
turning
to
Monte
Cristo
,
who
understood
it
*NL*
perfectly
,
--
``
Did
you
see
,
''
said
he
,
``
how
he
looked
at
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
the
count
;
``
but
did
you
think
there
was
anything
particular
*NL*
in
his
look
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
I
did
;
and
what
does
he
mean
by
his
news
from
Greece
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
I
tell
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
I
imagine
you
have
correspondents
in
that
country
.
''
Monte
*NL*
Cristo
smiled
significantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stop
,
''
said
Albert
,
``
here
he
comes
.
I
shall
compliment
Mademoiselle
*NL*
Danglars
on
her
cameo
,
while

father
talks
to

*NL*
*NL*
``
If

compliment

Monte

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

would
do
that

*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
viscount

are
dreadfully
impertinent

Albert
advanced
*NL*
towards
Eugenie
,
smiling
.
Meanwhile
,
Danglars
,
stooping
to
Monte
*NL*
Cristo
's
ear
,
``
Your
advice
was
excellent
,
''
said
he
;
``
there
is
a
whole
*NL*
history
connected
with
the
names
Fernand
and
Yanina

*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed

said
Monte

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

will
tell

take
away

can
not

presence

*NL*
*NL*
``
He

*NL*
*NL*
``
Immediately

*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well

The
count
made
a
sign
to
Albert
and
they
bowed
to
*NL*
the
ladies
,
and
took
their
leave
,
Albert
perfectly
indifferent
to
*NL*
Mademoiselle
Danglars

contempt
,
Monte
Cristo
reiterating
his
advice

to
Madame
Danglars
on
the
prudence

wife
should
exercise
in

providing
for

Albert

turning
towards

burst
into
a
loud
fit

laughter

much
too
loud
in

not

renewed
energy

The

stopped

Monte

as
he
stepped
out
of

carriage

They
both
went
into
the
house

the
drawing-room
was
lighted
*NL*
up

they
went
in
there

``
You

the
*NL*
count

Baptistin
left
the
room
without
waiting
to
answer
,
and
in
*NL*
two
seconds
reappeared
,
bringing
on
a
waiter
all
that
his
master
had
*NL*
ordered
,
ready
prepared
,
and
appearing
to
have
sprung
from

,
*NL*
like
the
repasts
which
we
read
of

``
Really

said
Morcerf

``
what
I

your

there

yourself

is
it

only
your

is
your
manner

being
served

without
any
questions

in
a
moment

in

a
second

it

as

you
wanted

made
a
point

keeping
everything
you

desire

in
constant
readiness

*NL*
*NL*

What
you

*NL*

I
should
like

*NL*
*NL*
Monte

took
the
gong
and
struck
it
once
.
In
about
the
space
of
a
*NL*
second
a
private
door
opened
,

Ali
appeared
,
bringing
two
chibouques
*NL*
filled
with
excellent
latakia

Albert

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no

it

Monte

Ali
knows
I
*NL*
generally
smoke

taking
my

he
has
heard

he
also
knows
that
I
brought
you
home
with
me
;
when
I
*NL*
summoned
him
he
naturally
guessed
the
reason

my
doing
so

as
he
*NL*
comes
from
a
country
where
hospitality
is
especially
manifested
through
*NL*
the
medium
of
smoking
,
he
naturally
concludes
that
we
shall
smoke
in
*NL*
company
,

therefore
brings
two
chibouques
instead
of
one

and
now
the

mystery
is
solved

*NL*
*NL*

--
Ah

''
and
Morcerf
*NL*
inclined
his
head
towards
the
door
,
through
which
sounds
seemed
to
issue

resembling
those
of
a
guitar

reappeared

the

followed

into

awaiting

visitors

apartments

Indian
silks
which
enveloped
her
.
Near
her
was
*NL*
the
instrument
on
which
she
had
just
been
playing
;
it
was
elegantly
*NL*
fashioned
,
and
worthy
of
its
mistress
.
On
perceiving
Monte
Cristo
,
she
*NL*
arose
and
welcomed
him
with
a
smile
peculiar
to
herself
,
expressive
at
*NL*
once
of
the
most
implicit
obedience
and
also
of
the
deepest
love
.
Monte
*NL*
Cristo
advanced
towards
her
and
extended
his
hand
,
which
she
as
usual
*NL*
raised
to
her
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
Albert
had
proceeded
no
farther
than
the
door
,
where
he
remained
rooted
*NL*
to
the
spot
,
being
completely
fascinated
by
the
sight
of
such
surpassing
*NL*
beauty
,
beheld
as
it
was
for
the
first
time
,
and
of
which
an
inhabitant
*NL*
of
more
northern
climes
could
form
no
adequate
idea
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whom
do
you
bring
?
''
asked
the
young
girl
in
Romaic
,
of
Monte
Cristo
;
*NL*
``
is
it
a
friend
,
a
brother
,
a
simple
acquaintance
,
or
an
enemy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
friend
,
''
said
Monte
Cristo
in
the
same
language
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
his
name
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Count
Albert
;
it
is
the
same
man
whom
I
rescued
from
the
hands
of
the
*NL*
banditti
at
Rome
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
what
language
would
you
like
me
to
converse
with
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Monte
Cristo
turned
to
Albert
.
``
Do
you
know
modern
Greek
,
''
asked
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas
,
no
,
''
said
Albert
;
``
nor
even
ancient
Greek
,
my
dear
count
;
never
*NL*
had
Homer
or
Plato
a
more
unworthy
scholar
than
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
''
said
Haidee
,
proving
by
her
remark
that
she
had
quite
understood
*NL*
Monte
Cristo
's
question
and
Albert
's
answer
,
``
then
I
will
speak
either
*NL*
in
French
or
Italian
,
if
my
lord
so
wills
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Monte
Cristo
reflected
one
instant
.
``
You
will
speak
in
Italian
,
''
said
*NL*
he
.
Then
,
turning
towards
Albert
,
--
``
It
is
a
pity
you
do
not
understand
*NL*
either
ancient
or
modern
Greek
,
both
of
which
Haidee
speaks
so
fluently
;
*NL*
the
poor
child
will
be
obliged
to
talk
to
you
in
Italian
,
which
will
*NL*
give
you
but
a
very
false
idea
of
her
powers
of
conversation
.
''
The
*NL*
count
made
a
sign
to
Haidee
to
address
his
visitor
.
``
Sir
,
''
she
said
to
*NL*
Morcerf
,
``
you
are
most
welcome
as
the
friend
of
my
lord
and
master
.
''
*NL*
This
was
said
in
excellent
Tuscan
,
and
with
that
soft
Roman
accent
which
*NL*
makes
the
language
of
Dante
as
sonorous
as
that
of
Homer
.
Then
,
turning
*NL*
to
Ali
,
she
directed
him
to
bring
coffee
and
pipes
,
and
when
he
had
left
*NL*
the
room
to
execute
the
orders
of
his
young
mistress
she
beckoned
Albert
*NL*
to
approach
nearer
to
her
.
Monte
Cristo
and
Morcerf
drew
their
seats
*NL*
towards
a
small
table
,
on
which
were
arranged
music
,
drawings
,
and
vases
*NL*
of
flowers
.
Ali
then
entered
bringing
coffee
and
chibouques
;
as
to
M.
*NL*
Baptistin
,
this
portion
of
the
building
was
interdicted
to
him
.
Albert
*NL*
refused
the
pipe
which
the
Nubian
offered
him
.
``
Oh
,
take
it
--
take
it
,
''
*NL*
said
the
count
;
``
Haidee
is
almost
as
civilized
as
a
Parisian
;
the
smell
*NL*
of
an
Havana
is
disagreeable
to
her
,
but
the
tobacco
of
the
East
is
a
*NL*
most
delicious
perfume
,
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ali
left
the
room
.
The
cups
of
coffee
were
all
prepared
,
with
the
*NL*
addition
of
sugar
,
which
had
been
brought
for
Albert
.
Monte
Cristo
and
*NL*
Haidee
took
the
beverage
in
the
original
Arabian
manner
,
that
is
to
*NL*
say
,
without
sugar
.
Haidee
took
the
porcelain
cup
in
her
little
slender
*NL*
fingers
and
conveyed
it
to
her
mouth
with
all
the
innocent
artlessness
*NL*
of
a
child
when
eating
or
drinking
something
which
it
likes
.
At
this
*NL*
moment
two
women
entered
,
bringing
salvers
filled
with
ices
and
sherbet
,
*NL*
which
they
placed
on
two
small
tables
appropriated
to
that
purpose
.
*NL*
``
My
dear
host
,
and
you
,
signora
,
''
said
Albert
,
in
Italian
,
``
excuse
my
*NL*
apparent
stupidity
.
I
am
quite
bewildered
,
and
it
is
natural
that
it
*NL*
should
be
so
.
Here
I
am
in
the
heart
of
Paris
;
but
a
moment
ago
I
heard
*NL*
the
rumbling
of
the
omnibuses
and
the
tinkling
of
the
bells
of
the
*NL*
lemonade-sellers
,
and
now
I
feel
as
if
I
were
suddenly
transported
to
*NL*
the
East
;
not
such
as
I
have
seen
it
,
but
such
as
my
dreams
have
painted
*NL*
it
.
Oh
,
signora
,
if
I
could
but
speak
Greek
,
your
conversation
,
added
*NL*
to
the
fairy-scene
which
surrounds
me
,
would
furnish
an
evening
of
such
*NL*
delight
as
it
would
be
impossible
for
me
ever
to
forget
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
speak
sufficient
Italian
to
enable
me
to
converse
with
you
,
sir
,
''
*NL*
said
Haidee
quietly
;
``
and
if
you
like
what
is
Eastern

I
will
do
my
best
*NL*
to
secure
the
gratification

while
you
are
here

*NL*
*NL*
``
On
what
subject
shall
I
converse
with
her

said
Albert
,
in
a
low
tone
*NL*
to
Monte
Cristo
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
what
you
please
;
you
may
speak
of
her
country
and
of
her
youthful
*NL*
reminiscences
,

if
you
like
it
better
you
can
talk
of
Rome
,
Naples
,
or
*NL*
Florence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
said
Albert
,
``
it
is
of
no
use
to
be
in
the
company
of
a
Greek
if
*NL*
one
converses
just
in
the
same
style
as
with
a
Parisian

let
me
speak
to
*NL*
her
of
the
East

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
so
then

for
of
all
themes

you
could
choose

the
*NL*
most
agreeable
to
her
taste

''
Albert
turned
towards
Haidee
.
``
At
what
age
*NL*
did
you
leave
Greece

asked
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
left
it
when
I
was
but
five
years

replied
Haidee
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
have
you
any
recollection
of
your
country
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
I
shut
my
eyes
and
think
,
I
seem
to
see
it
all
again

The
mind
can
*NL*
see
as
well
as
the
body

The
body
forgets
sometimes

but
the
mind
never
*NL*
forgets
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
far
back
into
the
past
do
your
recollections
extend
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
scarcely
walk
when
my
mother
,
who
was
called
Vasiliki
,
which
*NL*
means
royal
,
''
said
the
young
girl
,
tossing
her
head
proudly
,
``
took
me
by
*NL*
the
hand
,
and
after
putting
in
our
purse
all
the
money
we
possessed
,
we
*NL*
went
out
,
both
covered
with
veils

to
solicit
alms
for
the
prisoners

*NL*
saying
,
`
He
who
giveth

Lord

Then
when
our
*NL*
purse
was
full
we
returned
to
the
palace
,
and
without
saying
a
word
to
*NL*
my
father
,
we
sent
it
to
the
convent
,
where
it
was
divided
amongst
the
*NL*
prisoners

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
old
were
you
at
that
time
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
three
years

said
Haidee
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
remember
everything

went
on
about
you

said
Albert
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Everything

Albert
,
in
a
low
tone
to
Monte

,
``
do
allow

to
tell
me
something

You
prohibited
my
*NL*
mentioning

her
,
but
perhaps
she
will
allude
to
him
*NL*
of
her
own
accord
in

course

the
recital

you
have
no
idea

delighted

hear

pronounced
by
such
beautiful

Monte

turned
to
Haidee
,
and
with
an
expression
of
*NL*
countenance
which
commanded
her
to
pay
the
most
implicit
attention
to
*NL*
his
words
,
he
said
in
Greek
,
--
``
Tell
us
the
fate

neither
the
name

treason

Haidee
sighed
deeply
,
*NL*
and
a
shade
of
sadness
clouded
her
beautiful
brow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
saying
to
her
?
''
said
Morcerf
in
an
undertone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
again
reminded
her
that
you
were
a
friend
,
and
that
she
need
not
*NL*
conceal
anything
from
you

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
''
said
Albert
,
``
this
pious
pilgrimage
in
behalf
of
the
prisoners
*NL*
was
your
first
remembrance
;
what
is
the
next
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
then
I
remember
as
if
it
were
but
yesterday
sitting
under
the
shade
*NL*
of
some
sycamore-trees
,
on
the
borders
of
a
lake
,
in
the
waters
of
which
*NL*
the
trembling
foliage
was
reflected
as
in
a
mirror
.
Under
the
oldest
and
*NL*
thickest
of
these
trees
,
reclining
on
cushions
,
sat
my
father
;
my
mother
*NL*
was
at
his
feet
,
and
I
,
childlike
,
amused
myself
by
playing
with
his
*NL*
long
white
beard
which
descended
to
his
girdle
,
or
with
the
diamond-hilt
*NL*
of
the
scimitar
attached
to
his
girdle
.
Then
from
time
to
time
there
*NL*
came
to
him
an
Albanian
who
said
something
to
which
I
paid
no
attention
,
*NL*
but
which
he
always
answered
in
the
same
tone
of
voice
,
either
`
Kill
,
'
*NL*
or
`
Pardon
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
very
strange
,
''
said
Albert
,
``
to
hear
such
words
proceed
from
the
*NL*
mouth
of
any
one
but
an
actress
on
the
stage
,
and
one
needs
constantly
*NL*
to
be
saying
to
one
's
self
,
`
This
is
no
fiction
,
it
is
all
reality
,
'
in
*NL*
order
to
believe
it

And
how
does
France
appear
in
your
eyes
,
accustomed
*NL*
as
they
have
been
to
gaze
on
such
enchanted
scenes
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
it
is
a
fine
country
,
''
said
Haidee
,
``
but
I
see
France
as
it
*NL*
really
is
,
because
I
look
on
it
with
the
eyes
of
a
woman
;
whereas
my
own
*NL*
country
,
which
I
can
only
judge
of
from
the
impression
produced
on
my
*NL*
childish
mind
,
always
seems
enveloped
in
a
vague
atmosphere
,
which
is
*NL*
luminous

otherwise

according

my
remembrances
of
it
are
sad

*NL*
joyous

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
young

''
said
Albert
,
forgetting
at
the
moment
the
Count
's
command
*NL*
that
he
should
ask
no
questions
of
the
slave
herself
,
``
is
it
possible

that
you
can
have
known
what
suffering
is
except
by
name

*NL*
*NL*
Haidee
turned
her
eyes
towards
Monte
Cristo
,
who
,
making
at
the
same
*NL*
time
some
imperceptible
sign
,
murmured
,

``
Go
on

*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing

ever
so
firmly
impressed

early
childhood

exception
of
the
two
scenes
I
have
just
*NL*
described
to
you

all
my

reminiscences
are
fraught
with
deepest

sadness

*NL*
*NL*
``
Speak

Albert

``
I
am
listening
with
the
most
*NL*
intense
delight

interest
to
all
you
say

*NL*
*NL*
Haidee
answered
his
remark
with
a
melancholy
smile
.
``
You
wish
me
,
then
,
*NL*
to
relate
the
history
of
my
past
sorrows

said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beg
you
to
do
so
,
''
replied
Albert
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
was
but
four
years
old
when
one
night
I
was
suddenly
awakened
*NL*
by
my
mother
.
We
were
in
the
palace
of
Yanina
;
she
snatched
me
from
*NL*
the
cushions
on
which
I
was
sleeping
,
and
on
opening
my
eyes
I
saw
hers
*NL*
filled
with
tears
.
She
took
me
away
without
speaking
.
When
I
saw
her
*NL*
weeping
I
began
to
cry
too
.
`
Hush
,
child
!
'
said
she
.
At
other
times
in
*NL*
spite
of
maternal
endearments
or
threats
,
I
had
with
a
child
's
caprice
*NL*
been
accustomed
to
indulge
my
feelings
of
sorrow
or
anger
by
crying
as
*NL*
much
as
I
felt
inclined
;
but
on
this
occasion
there
was
an
intonation
*NL*
of
such
extreme
terror
in
my
mother
's
voice
when
she
enjoined
me
to
*NL*
silence
,
that
I
ceased
crying
as
soon
as
her
command
was
given
.
She
bore
*NL*
me
rapidly
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
saw
then
that
we
were
descending
a
large
staircase
;
around
us
were
*NL*
all
my
mother
's
servants
carrying
trunks
,
bags
,
ornaments
,
jewels
,
*NL*
purses
of
gold
,
with
which
they
were
hurrying
away
in
the
greatest
*NL*
distraction
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Behind
the
women
came
a
guard
of
twenty
men
armed
with
long
guns
and
*NL*
pistols
,
and
dressed
in
the
costume
which
the
Greeks
have
assumed
since
*NL*
they
have
again
become
a
nation
.
You
may
imagine
there
was
something
*NL*
startling
and
ominous
,
''
said
Haidee
,
shaking
her
head
and
turning
pale
*NL*
at
the
mere
remembrance
of
the
scene
,
``
in
this
long
file
of
slaves
and
*NL*
women
only
half-aroused
from
sleep
,
or
at
least
so
they
appeared
to
*NL*
me
,
who
was
myself
scarcely
awake
.
Here
and
there
on
the
walls
of
*NL*
the
staircase
,
were
reflected
gigantic
shadows
,
which
trembled
in
the
*NL*
flickering
light
of
the
pine-torches
till
they
seemed
to
reach
to
the
*NL*
vaulted
roof
above
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Quick
!

said
a
voice
at
the
end
of
the
gallery
.
This
voice
made
every
*NL*
one
bow
before
it
,
resembling
in
its
effect
the
wind
passing
over
a
*NL*
field
of
wheat
,
by
its
superior
strength
forcing
every
ear
to
yield
*NL*
obeisance
.
As
for
me
,
it
made
me
tremble
.
This
voice
was
that
of
my
*NL*
father
.
He
came
last
,
clothed
in
his
splendid
robes
and
holding
in
his
*NL*
hand
the
carbine
which
your
emperor
presented
him
.
He
was
leaning
on
*NL*
the
shoulder
of
his
favorite
Selim
,
and
he
drove
us
all
before
him
,
as
*NL*
a
shepherd
would
his
straggling
flock
.
My
father
,
''
said
Haidee
,
raising
*NL*
her
head
,
``
was
that
illustrious
man
known
in
Europe
under
the
name
of
*NL*
Ali
Tepelini
,
pasha
of
Yanina
,
and
before
whom
Turkey
trembled
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Albert
,
without
knowing
why
,
started
on
hearing
these
words
pronounced
*NL*
with
such
a
haughty
and
dignified
accent
;
it
appeared
to
him
as
if
there
*NL*
was
something
supernaturally
gloomy
and
terrible
in
the
expression
which
*NL*
gleamed
from
the
brilliant
eyes
of
Haidee
at
this
moment
;
she
appeared
*NL*
like
a
Pythoness
evoking
a
spectre
,
as
she
recalled
to
his
mind
the
*NL*
remembrance
of
the
fearful
death
of
this
man
,
to
the
news
of
which
all
*NL*
Europe
had
listened
with
horror
.
``
Soon
,
''
said
Haidee
,
``
we
halted
on
our
*NL*
march
,
and
found
ourselves
on
the
borders
of
a
lake
.
My
mother
pressed
*NL*
me
to
her
throbbing
heart
,
and
at
the
distance
of
a
few
paces
I
saw
my
*NL*
father
,
who
was
glancing
anxiously
around
.
Four
marble
steps
led
down
to
*NL*
the
water
's
edge
,
and
below
them
was
a
boat
floating
on
the
tide
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
where
we
stood
I
could
see
in
the
middle
of
the
lake
a
large
blank
*NL*
mass
;
it
was
the
kiosk
to
which
we
were
going
.
This
kiosk
appeared
to
me
*NL*
to
be
at
a
considerable
distance
,
perhaps
on
account
of
the
darkness
*NL*
of
the
night
,
which
prevented
any
object
from
being
more
than
partially
*NL*
discerned
.
We
stepped
into
the
boat
.
I
remember
well
that
the
oars
*NL*
made
no
noise
whatever
in
striking
the
water
,
and
when
I
leaned
over
to
*NL*
ascertain
the
cause
I
saw
that
they
were
muffled
with
the
sashes
of
our
*NL*
Palikares
.
-LSB-
*
-RSB-
Besides
the
rowers
,
the
boat
contained
only
the
women
,
my
*NL*
father
,
mother
,
Selim
,
and
myself
.
The
Palikares
had
remained
on
the
*NL*
shore
of
the
lake
,
ready
to
cover
our
retreat
;
they
were
kneeling
on
the
*NL*
lowest
of
the
marble
steps
,
and
in
that
manner
intended
making
a
rampart
*NL*
of
the
three
others
,
in
case
of
pursuit
.
Our
bark
flew
before
the
wind
.
*NL*
`
Why
does
the
boat
go
so
fast
?

asked
I
of
my
mother

I
did
not

Why

should
my
father
fly
?
--
he
,
the
all-powerful

he
,
before
whom

were
*NL*
accustomed

he

for

It
was
,
indeed
,
a
flight
which
my
father
was
trying
*NL*
to
effect

have
been
told
since
that

*NL*
*NL*
Here
Haidee
cast
a
significant
glance
at
Monte
Cristo
,
whose
eyes
*NL*
had
been
riveted
on
her
countenance
during
the
whole
course
of
her
*NL*
narrative
.
The
young
girl
then
continued
,
speaking
slowly
,
like
a
person
*NL*
who
is
either
inventing
or
suppressing
some
feature
of
the
history
which
*NL*
he
is
relating
.
``
You
were
saying
,
signora
,
''
said
Albert
,
who
was
paying
*NL*
the
most
implicit
attention
to
the
recital
,
``
that

Ali
Tepelini
--
after
having
sent
to
the
sultan
a
French
officer
in
whom
*NL*
he
reposed
great
confidence

resolved
to
retire
to
the
asylum

he
*NL*
had
long
before
prepared
for
himself

he
called

*NL*
``

asked
Albert
,
``

exchanged
a
rapid
glance
with
the
young
girl
,
which
was
*NL*
quite
unperceived
by
Albert

``
No

said
she
,
``

Albert
was
on
the
point
of
pronouncing
his
father
's
name
,
when
*NL*
Monte
Cristo
gently
held
up
his
finger
in
token
of
reproach

the
young

man
recollected
his
promise

``
It
was
towards
this
kiosk
that
we
were
rowing
.
A
ground-floor
,
*NL*
ornamented
with
arabesques
,
bathing
its
terraces
in
the
water
,
and
*NL*
another
floor
,
looking
on
the
lake
,
was
all
which
was
visible
to
the
*NL*
eye
.
But
beneath
the
ground-floor
,
stretching
out
into
the
island
,
was
*NL*
a
large
subterranean
cavern
,
to
which
my
mother
,
myself
,
and
the
women
*NL*
were
conducted
.
In
this
place
were
together
60,000
.
pouches
and
200
*NL*
barrels
;
the
pouches
contained
25,000,000
of
money
in
gold
,
and
the
*NL*
barrels
were
filled
with
30,000
.
pounds
of
gunpowder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Near
the
barrels
stood
Selim
,
my
father
's
favorite
,
whom
I
mentioned
to
*NL*
you
just
now
.
He
stood
watch
day
and
night
with
a
lance
provided
with
*NL*
a
lighted
slowmatch
in
his
hand
,
and
he
had
orders
to
blow
up
*NL*
everything
--
kiosk
,
guards
,
women
,
gold
,
and
Ali
Tepelini
himself
--
at
*NL*
the
first
signal
given
by
my
father
.
I
remember
well
that
the
slaves
,
*NL*
convinced
of
the
precarious
tenure
on
which
they
held
their
lives
,
*NL*
passed
whole
days
and
nights
in
praying
,
crying
,
and
groaning
.
As
for
*NL*
me
,
I
can
never
forget
the
pale
complexion
and
black
eyes
of
the
young
*NL*
soldier
,
and
whenever
the
angel
of
death
summons
me
to
another
world
,
*NL*
I
am
quite
sure
I
shall
recognize
Selim
.
I
can
not
tell
you
how
long
we
*NL*
remained
in
this
state
;
at
that
period
I
did
not
even
know
what
time
*NL*
meant
.
Sometimes
,
but
very
rarely
,
my
father
summoned
me
and
my
mother
*NL*
to
the
terrace
of
the
palace
;
these
were
hours
of
recreation
for
me
,
as
*NL*
I
never
saw
anything
in
the
dismal
cavern
but
the
gloomy
countenances
of
*NL*
the
slaves
and
Selim
's
fiery
lance
.
My
father
was
endeavoring
to
pierce
*NL*
with
his
eager
looks
the
remotest
verge
of
the
horizon
,
examining
*NL*
attentively
every
black
speck
which
appeared
on
the
lake
,
while
my
*NL*
mother
,
reclining
by
his
side
,
rested
her
head
on
his
shoulder
,
and
I
*NL*
played
at
his
feet
,
admiring
everything
I
saw
with
that
unsophisticated
*NL*
innocence
of
childhood
which
throws
a
charm
round
objects
insignificant
*NL*
in
themselves
,
but
which
in
its
eyes
are
invested
with
the
greatest
*NL*
importance
.
The
heights
of
Pindus
towered
above
us
;
the
castle
of
Yanina
*NL*
rose
white
and
angular
from
the
blue
waters
of
the
lake
,
and
the
immense
*NL*
masses
of
black
vegetation
which
,
viewed
in
the
distance
,
gave
the
idea
*NL*
of
lichens
clinging
to
the
rocks
,
were
in
reality
gigantic
fir-trees
and
*NL*
myrtles
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
morning
my
father
sent
for
us
;
my
mother
had
been
crying
all
the
*NL*
night
,
and
was
very
wretched
;
we
found
the
pasha
calm
,
but
paler
than
*NL*
usual
.
`
Take
courage
,
Vasiliki
,
'
said
he
;
`
to-day
arrives
the
firman
of
*NL*
the
master
,
and
my
fate
will
be
decided
.
If
my
pardon
be
complete
,
we
*NL*
shall
return
triumphant
to
Yanina
;
if
the
news
be
inauspicious
,
we
must
*NL*
fly
this
night
.
'
--
`
But
supposing
our
enemy
should
not
allow
us
to
do
*NL*
so
?
'
said
my
mother
.
`
Oh
,
make
yourself
easy
on
that
head
,
'
said
Ali
,
*NL*
smiling
;
`
Selim
and
his
flaming
lance
will
settle
that
matter
.
They
*NL*
would
be
glad
to
see
me
dead
,
but
they
would
not
like
themselves
to
die
*NL*
with
me
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
mother
only
answered
by
sighs
to
consolations
which
she
knew
did
not
*NL*
come
from
my
father
's
heart
.
She
prepared
the
iced
water
which
he
was
in
*NL*
the
habit
of
constantly
drinking
,
--
for
since
his
sojourn
at
the
kiosk
*NL*
he
had
been
parched
by
the
most
violent
fever
,
--
after
which
she
anointed
*NL*
his
white
beard
with
perfumed
oil
,
and
lighted
his
chibouque
,
which
he
*NL*
sometimes
smoked
for
hours
together
,
quietly
watching
the
wreaths
of
*NL*
vapor
that
ascended
in
spiral
clouds
and
gradually
melted
away
in
the
*NL*
surrounding
atmosphere
.
Presently
he
made
such
a
sudden
movement
that
I
*NL*
was
paralyzed
with
fear
.
Then
,
without
taking
his
eyes
from
the
object
*NL*
which
had
first
attracted
his
attention
,
he
asked
for
his
telescope
.
*NL*
My
mother
gave
it
him
,
and
as
she
did
so
,
looked
whiter
than
the
*NL*
marble
against
which
she
leaned
.
I
saw
my
father
's
hand
tremble
.
'
A
*NL*
boat
!
--
two
!
--
three
!
'
murmured
my
,
father
;
--
`
four

He
then
arose
,
*NL*
seizing
his
arms
and
priming
his
pistols
.
`
Vasiliki
,
'
said
he
to
my
*NL*
mother
,
trembling
perceptibly
,
`
the
instant
approaches
which
will
decide
*NL*
everything
.
In
the
space
of
half
an
hour
we
shall
know
the
emperor
's
*NL*
answer
.
Go
into
the
cavern
with
Haidee
.

--
'
I
will
not
quit
you
,

said
*NL*
Vasiliki
;
`
if
you
die
,
my
lord
,
I
will
die
with
you
.
'
--
`
Go
to
Selim
!
'
*NL*
cried
my
father
.
`
Adieu
,
my
lord
,
'
murmured
my
mother
,
determining
*NL*
quietly
to
await
the
approach
of
death
.
`
Take
away
Vasiliki
!
'
said
my
*NL*
father
to
his
Palikares
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
for
me
,
I
had
been
forgotten
in
the
general
confusion
;
I
ran
toward
*NL*
Ali
Tepelini
;
he
saw
me
hold
out
my
arms
to
him
,
and
he
stooped
down
and
*NL*
pressed
my
forehead
with
his
lips
.
Oh
,
how
distinctly
I
remember
that
*NL*
kiss
!
--
it
was
the
last
he
ever
gave
me
,
and
I
feel
as
if
it
were
still
*NL*
warm
on
my
forehead
.
On
descending
,
we
saw
through
the
lattice-work
*NL*
several
boats
which
were
gradually
becoming
more
distinct
to
our
view
.
*NL*
At
first
they
appeared
like
black
specks
,
and
now
they
looked
like
birds
*NL*
skimming
the
surface
of
the
waves
.
During
this
time
,
in
the
kiosk
at
my
*NL*
father
's
feet
,
were
seated
twenty
Palikares
,
concealed
from
view
by
an
*NL*
angle
of
the
wall
and
watching
with
eager
eyes
the
arrival
of
the
boats
.
*NL*
They
were
armed
with
their
long
guns
inlaid
with
mother-of-pearl
and
*NL*
silver
,
and
cartridges
in
great
numbers
were
lying
scattered
on
the
*NL*
floor
.
My
father
looked
at
his
watch
,
and
paced
up
and
down
with
a
*NL*
countenance
expressive
of
the
greatest
anguish
.
This
was
the
scene
which
*NL*
presented
itself
to
my
view
as
I
quitted
my
father
after
that
last
kiss
.
*NL*
My
mother
and
I
traversed
the
gloomy
passage
leading
to
the
cavern
.
*NL*
Selim
was
still
at
his
post
,
and
smiled
sadly
on
us
as
we
entered
.
We
*NL*
fetched
our
cushions
from
the
other
end
of
the
cavern
,
and
sat
down
by
*NL*
Selim
.
In
great
dangers
the
devoted
ones
cling
to
each
other
;
and
,
young
*NL*
as
I
was
,
I
quite
understood
that
some
imminent
danger
was
hanging
over
*NL*
our
heads
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Albert
had
often
heard
--
not
from
his
father
,
for
he
never
spoke
on
the
*NL*
subject
,
but
from
strangers
--
the
description
of
the
last
moments
of
the
*NL*
vizier
of
Yanina
;
he
had
read
different
accounts
of
his
death
,
but
the
*NL*
story
seemed
to
acquire
fresh
meaning
from
the
voice
and
expression
of
*NL*
the
young
girl
,
and
her
sympathetic
accent
and
the
melancholy
expression
*NL*
of
her
countenance
at
once
charmed
and
horrified
him
.
As
to
Haidee
,
*NL*
these
terrible
reminiscences
seemed
to
have
overpowered
her
for
a
*NL*
moment
,
for
she
ceased
speaking
,
her
head
leaning
on
her
hand
like
a
*NL*
beautiful
flower
bowing
beneath
the
violence
of
the
storm
;
and
her
eyes
*NL*
gazing
on
vacancy
indicated
that
she
was
mentally
contemplating
the
*NL*
green
summit
of
the
Pindus
and
the
blue
waters
of
the
lake
of
Yanina
,
*NL*
which
,
like
a
magic
mirror
,
seemed
to
reflect
the
sombre
picture
*NL*
which
she
sketched

Monte

at

with
an
indescribable

expression
of
interest
and
pity

looked
up
abruptly
,
as
if
the
sonorous
tones
of
Monte
Cristo

*NL*
voice
had
awakened
her
from
a
dream
;
and
she
resumed
her
narrative

It
was
about
four
o'clock
in

afternoon

although
the
day
was

brilliant
out-of-doors

we
were
enveloped
in
the
gloomy
darkness
of
the
*NL*
cavern

One
single
,
solitary
light
was
burning
there
,
and
it
appeared

a
star
set
in

heaven
of
blackness

it
was
Selim
's
flaming
lance
.
*NL*
My
mother
was
a
Christian
,
and
she
prayed
.
Selim
repeated
from
time
to
*NL*
time
the
sacred
words
:
`
God
is
great
!
'
However
,
my
mother
had
still
*NL*
some
hope
.
As
she
was
coming
down
,
she
thought
she
recognized
the
French
*NL*
officer
who
had
been
sent
to
Constantinople
,
and
in
whom
my
father
*NL*
placed
so
much
confidence
;
for
he
knew
that
all
the
soldiers
of
the
*NL*
French
emperor
were
naturally
noble
and
generous
.
She
advanced
some
*NL*
steps
towards
the
staircase
,
and
listened
.
`
They
are
approaching
,
'
said
*NL*
she
;
`
perhaps
they
bring
us
peace
and
liberty
!
'
--
`
What
do
you
fear
,
*NL*
Vasiliki
?
'
said
Selim
,
in
a
voice
at
once
so
gentle
and
yet
so
proud
.
*NL*
`
If
they
do
not
bring
us
peace
,
we
will
give
them
war
;
if
they
do
not
*NL*
bring
life
,
we
will
give
them
death
.
'
And
he
renewed
the
flame
of
his
*NL*
lance
with
a
gesture
which
made
one
think
of
Dionysus
of
Crete
.
-LSB-

-RSB-
But
*NL*
I
,
being
only
a
little
child
,
was
terrified
by
this
undaunted
courage
,
*NL*
which
appeared
to
me
both
ferocious
and
senseless
,
and
I
recoiled
with
*NL*
horror
from
the
idea
of
the
frightful
death
amidst
fire
and
flames
which
*NL*
probably
awaited
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
The
god
of
fruitfulness
in
Grecian
mythology
.
In
Crete
he
*NL*
was
supposed
to
be
slain
in
winter
with
the
decay
of
*NL*
vegetation
and
to
revive
in
the
spring
.
Haidee
's
learned
*NL*
reference
is
to
the
behavior
of
an
actor
in
the
Dionysian

festivals

*NL*
*NL*
``
My
mother
experienced
the
same
sensations
,
for
I
felt
her
tremble
.
*NL*
`
Mamma
,
mamma
,
'
said
I
,
`
are
we
really
to
be
killed
?
'
And
at
the
*NL*
sound
of
my
voice
the
slaves
redoubled
their
cries
and
prayers
and
*NL*
lamentations
.
`
My
child
,
'
said
Vasiliki
,
`
may
God
preserve
you
from
ever
*NL*
wishing
for
that
death
which
to-day
you
so
much
dread
!
'
Then
,
whispering
*NL*
to
Selim
,
she
asked
what
were
her
master
's
orders
.
`
If
he
send
me
*NL*
his
poniard
,
it
will
signify
that
the
emperor
's
intentions
are
not
*NL*
favorable
,
and
I
am
to
set
fire
to
the
powder
;
if
,
on
the
contrary
,
he
*NL*
send
me
his
ring
,
it
will
be
a
sign
that
the
emperor
pardons
him
,
and
*NL*
I
am
to
extinguish
the
match
and
leave
the
magazine
untouched
.
'
--
`
My
*NL*
friend
,
'
said
my
mother
,
`
when
your
master
's
orders
arrive
,
if
it
is
the
*NL*
poniard
which
he
sends
,
instead
of
despatching
us
by
that
horrible
death
*NL*
which
we
both
so
much
dread

you
will
mercifully
kill
us
with
this

*NL*
poniard

will
you
not
?
'
--
`
Yes
,
Vasiliki
,
'
replied
Selim
tranquilly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Suddenly
we
heard
loud
cries
;
and
,
listening
,
discerned
that
they
*NL*
were
cries
of
joy
.
The
name
of
the
French
officer
who
had
been
sent
*NL*
to
Constantinople
resounded
on
all
sides
amongst
our
Palikares
;
it
*NL*
was
evident
that
he
brought
the
answer
of
the
emperor
,
and
that
it
was
*NL*
favorable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
do
you
not
remember
the
Frenchman
's
name
?
''
said
Morcerf
,
quite
*NL*
ready
to
aid
the
memory
of
the
narrator
.
Monte
Cristo
made
a
sign
to
him
*NL*
to
be
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
recollect
it
,
''
said
Haidee
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
noise
increased
;
steps
were
heard
approaching
nearer
and
nearer
:
*NL*
they
were
descending
the
steps
leading
to
the
cavern
.
Selim
made
ready
*NL*
his
lance
.
Soon
a
figure
appeared
in
the
gray
twilight
at
the
entrance
*NL*
of
the
cave
,
formed
by
the
reflection
of
the
few
rays
of
daylight
which
*NL*
had
found
their
way
into
this
gloomy
retreat
.
`
Who
are
you
?
'
cried
*NL*
Selim
.
`
But
whoever
you
may
be
,
I
charge
you
not
to
advance
another
*NL*
step
.
'
--
`
Long
live
the
emperor
!
'
said
the
figure
.
`
He
grants
a
full
*NL*
pardon
to
the
Vizier
Ali
,
and
not
only
gives
him
his
life
,
but
restores
*NL*
to
him
his
fortune
and
his
possessions
.
'
My
mother
uttered
a
cry
of
joy
,
*NL*
and
clasped
me
to
her
bosom
.
`
Stop
,
'
said
Selim
,
seeing
that
she
was
*NL*
about
to
go
out
;
`
you
see
I
have
not
yet
received
the
ring
,
'
--
`
True
,
'
*NL*
said
my
mother
.
And
she
fell
on
her
knees
,
at
the
same
time
holding
me
*NL*
up
towards
heaven
,
as
if
she
desired
,
while
praying
to
God
in
my
behalf
,
*NL*
to
raise
me
actually
to
his
presence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
for
the
second
time
Haidee
stopped
,
overcome
by
such
violent
emotion
*NL*
that
the
perspiration
stood
upon
her
pale
brow
,
and
her
stifled
voice
*NL*
seemed
hardly
able
to
find
utterance
,
so
parched
and
dry
were
her
throat
*NL*
and
lips
.
Monte
Cristo
poured
a
little
iced
water
into
a
glass
,
and
*NL*
presented
it
to
her
,
saying
with
a
mildness
in
which
was
also
a
shade
of
*NL*
command
,
--
``
Courage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Haidee
dried
her
eyes
,
and
continued
:
``
By
this
time
our
eyes
,
habituated
*NL*
to
the
darkness
,
had
recognized
the
messenger
of
the
pasha
,
--
it
was
*NL*
a
friend
.
Selim
had
also
recognized
him
,
but
the
brave
young
man
only
*NL*
acknowledged
one
duty
,
which
was
to
obey
.
`
In
whose
name
do
you
come
?
'
*NL*
said
he
to
him
.
'
I
come
in
the
name
of
our
master
,
Ali
Tepelini
.
'
--
`
If
*NL*
you
come
from
Ali
himself
,
'
said
Selim
,
`
you
know
what
you
were
charged
*NL*
to
remit
to
me
?
'
--
`
Yes
,
'
said
the
messenger
,
`
and
I
bring
you
his
ring
.
'
*NL*
At
these
words
he
raised
his
hand
above
his
head
,
to
show
the
token
;
*NL*
but
it
was
too
far
off
,
and
there
was
not
light
enough
to
enable
Selim
,
*NL*
where
he
was
standing
,
to
distinguish
and
recognize
the
object
presented
*NL*
to
his
view
.
'
I
do
not
see
what
you
have
in
your
hand
,

said
Selim
.
*NL*
`
Approach
then
,
'
said
the
messenger
,
`
or
I
will
come
nearer
to
you
,
if
*NL*
you
prefer
it
.
'
--
'
I
will
agree
to
neither
one
nor
the
other
,
'
replied
*NL*
the
young
soldier
;
`
place
the
object
which
I
desire
to
see
in
the
ray
of
*NL*
light
which
shines
there
,
and
retire
while
I
examine
it
.
'
--
`
Be
it
so
,
'
*NL*
said
the
envoy
;
and
he
retired
,
after
having
first
deposited
the
token
*NL*
agreed
on
in
the
place
pointed
out
to
him
by
Selim
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
how
our
hearts
palpitated
;
for
it
did
,
indeed
,
seem
to
be
a
ring
*NL*
which
was
placed
there
.
But
was
it
my
father
's
ring
?
that
was
the
*NL*
question
.
Selim
,
still
holding
in
his
hand
the
lighted
match
,
walked
*NL*
towards
the
opening
in
the
cavern
,
and
,
aided
by
the
faint
light
which
*NL*
streamed
in
through
the
mouth
of
the
cave
,
picked
up
the
token
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
It
is
well
,
'
said
he
,
kissing
it
;
`
it
is
my
master
's
ring
!
'
And
*NL*
throwing
the
match
on
the
ground
,
he
trampled
on
it
and
extinguished
it
.
*NL*
The
messenger
uttered
a
cry
of
joy
and
clapped
his
hands
.
At
this
signal
*NL*
four
soldiers
of
the
Serasker
Koorshid
suddenly
appeared
,
and
Selim
*NL*
fell
,
pierced
by
five
blows
.
Each
man
had
stabbed
him
separately
,
and
,
*NL*
intoxicated
by
their
crime
,
though
still
pale
with
fear
,
they
sought
all
*NL*
over
the
cavern
to
discover
if
there
was
any
fear
of
fire
,
after
which
*NL*
they
amused
themselves
by
rolling
on
the
bags
of
gold
.
At
this
moment
*NL*
my
mother
seized
me
in
her
arms
,
and
hurrying
noiselessly
along
numerous
*NL*
turnings
and
windings
known
only
to
ourselves
,
she
arrived
at
a
private
*NL*
staircase
of
the
kiosk
,
where
was
a
scene
of
frightful
tumult
and
*NL*
confusion
.
The
lower
rooms
were
entirely
filled
with
Koorshid
's
troops
;
*NL*
that
is
to
say
,
with
our
enemies
.
Just
as
my
mother
was
on
the
point
of
*NL*
pushing
open
a
small
door
,
we
heard
the
voice
of
the
pasha
sounding
in
*NL*
a
loud
and
threatening
tone
.
My
mother
applied
her
eye
to
the
crack
*NL*
between
the
boards
;
I
luckily
found
a
small
opening
which
afforded
me
a
*NL*
view
of
the
apartment
and
what
was
passing
within
.
`
What
do
you
want
?
'
*NL*
said
my
father
to
some
people
who
were
holding
a
paper
inscribed
with
*NL*
characters
of
gold
.
`
What
we
want
,
'
replied
one
,
`
is
to
communicate
to
*NL*
you
the
will
of
his
highness
.
Do
you
see
this
firman
?
'
--
'
I
do
,
'
said
my
*NL*
father
.
`
Well
,
read
it
;
he
demands
your
head
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
father
answered
with
a
loud
laugh
,
which
was
more
frightful
than
*NL*
even
threats
would
have
been
,
and
he
had
not
ceased
when
two
reports
of
*NL*
a
pistol
were
heard
;
he
had
fired
them
himself
,
and
had
killed
two
men
.
*NL*
The
Palikares
,
who
were
prostrated
at
my
father
's
feet
,
now
sprang
up
*NL*
and
fired
,
and
the
room
was
filled
with
fire
and
smoke
.
At
the
same
*NL*
instant
the
firing
began
on
the
other
side
,
and
the
balls
penetrated
the
*NL*
boards
all
round
us
.
Oh
,
how
noble
did
the
grand
vizier
my
father
look
*NL*
at
that
moment
,
in
the
midst
of
the
flying
bullets
,
his
scimitar
in
his
*NL*
hand
,
and
his
face
blackened
with
the
powder
of
his
enemies
!
and
how
he
*NL*
terrified
them
,
even
then
,
and
made
them
fly
before
him
!
`
Selim
,
Selim
!
'
*NL*
cried
he
,
`
guardian
of
the
fire
,
do
your
duty
!
'
--
`
Selim
is
dead
,
'
*NL*
replied
a
voice
which
seemed
to
come
from
the
depths
of
the
earth
,
`
and
*NL*
you
are
lost
,
Ali
!
'
At
the
same
moment
an
explosion
was
heard
,
and
the
*NL*
flooring
of
the
room
in
which
my
father
was
sitting
was
suddenly
torn
up
*NL*
and
shivered
to
atoms
--
the
troops
were
firing
from
underneath
.
Three
or
*NL*
four
Palikares
fell
with
their
bodies
literally
ploughed
with
wounds
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
father
howled
aloud
,
plunged
his
fingers
into
the
holes
which
the
*NL*
balls
had
made
,
and
tore
up
one
of
the
planks
entire
.
But
immediately
*NL*
through
this
opening
twenty
more
shots
were
fired
,
and
the
flame
,
*NL*
rushing
up
like
fire
from
the
crater
of
a
volcano
,
soon
reached
the
*NL*
tapestry
,
which
it
quickly
devoured
.
In
the
midst
of
all
this
frightful
*NL*
tumult
and
these
terrific
cries
,
two
reports
,
fearfully
distinct
,
*NL*
followed
by
two
shrieks
more
heartrending
than
all
,
froze
me
with
*NL*
terror
.
These
two
shots
had
mortally
wounded
my
father
,
and
it
was
he
*NL*
who
had
given
utterance
to
these
frightful
cries
.
However
,
he
remained
*NL*
standing
,
clinging
to
a
window
.
My
mother
tried
to
force
the
door
,
that
*NL*
she
might
go
and
die
with
him
,
but
it
was
fastened
on
the
inside
.
All
*NL*
around
him
were
lying
the
Palikares
,
writhing
in
convulsive
agonies
,
*NL*
while
two
or
three
who
were
only
slightly
wounded
were
trying
to
*NL*
escape
by
springing
from
the
windows
.
At
this
crisis
the
whole
flooring
*NL*
suddenly
gave
way
,
my
father
fell
on
one
knee
,
and
at
the
same
moment
*NL*
twenty
hands
were
thrust
forth
,
armed
with
sabres
,
pistols
,
and
*NL*
poniards
--
twenty
blows
were
instantaneously
directed
against
one
man
,
*NL*
and
my
father
disappeared
in
a
whirlwind
of
fire
and
smoke
kindled
by
*NL*
these
demons
,
and
which
seemed
like
hell
itself
opening
beneath
his
*NL*
feet
.
I
felt
myself
fall
to
the
ground
,
my
mother
had
fainted
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Haidee
's
arms
fell
by
her
side
,
and
she
uttered
a
deep
groan
,
at
the
*NL*
same
time
looking
towards
the
count
as
if
to
ask
if
he
were
satisfied
*NL*
with
her
obedience
to
his
commands
.
Monte
Cristo
arose
and
approached
*NL*
her
,
took
her
hand
,
and
said
to
her
in
Romaic
,
``
Calm
yourself

my
dear
*NL*
child

and
take
courage
in
remembering
that
there
is
a
God

punish
traitors

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
frightful
story

said
Albert
,
terrified
at
the
paleness
*NL*
of
Haidee
's
countenance
,
``
and
I
reproach
myself
now
for
having
been
so
*NL*
cruel
and
thoughtless
in
my
request

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

it
is
nothing

said
Monte
Cristo
.
Then
,
patting
the
young
girl
on
*NL*
the
head
,
he
continued
,
``
Haidee
is
very
courageous
,
and
she
sometimes
*NL*
even
finds
consolation
in
the
recital
of
her
misfortunes

*NL*
*NL*
``
Because

my

said
Haidee
eagerly
,
``
my

me

*NL*
Albert
looked
at
her
with
curiosity
,
for
she
had
not
yet
related
what
he
*NL*
most
desired
to
know
,
--
how
she
had
become
the
slave
of
the
count
.
Haidee
*NL*
saw
at
a
glance
the
same
expression
pervading
the
countenances
of
her
*NL*
two
auditors
;
she
exclaimed
,
`
When
my
mother
recovered
her
senses
we
*NL*
were
before

in

chastened

``

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

replied
Haidee
,
``
he
did
not
dare
to
keep
us
,
so
we
were
sold
to
*NL*
some
slave-merchants
who
were
going
to
Constantinople
.
We
traversed
*NL*
Greece
,
and
arrived
half
dead
at
the
imperial
gates
.
They
were
*NL*
surrounded
by
a
crowd
of
people
,
who
opened
a
way
for
us
to
pass
,
*NL*
when
suddenly
my
mother
,
having
looked
closely
at
an
object
which
was
*NL*
attracting
their
attention
,
uttered
a
piercing
cry
and
fell
to
the
*NL*
ground
,
pointing
as
she
did
so
to
a
head
which
was
placed
over
the
*NL*
gates
,
and
beneath
which
were
inscribed
these
words
:
*NL*
*NL*
''

I
cried
bitterly

tried
to
raise
my
mother
from
the
earth

but
she
was
dead
!
I
was
*NL*
taken
to
the
slave-market
,
and
was
purchased
by
a
rich
Armenian
.
He
*NL*
caused
me
to
be
instructed
,
gave
me
masters
,

when
I
was
thirteen

years
of

he
sold
me
to
the
Sultan
Mahmood

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
Monte

told
you

*NL*
``

kissing
the

count

hand
,
``

I
am
very
fortunate
in
belonging
to
such
a

''
*NL*
Albert
remained
quite
bewildered
with
all
that
he
had
seen
and
heard
.
*NL*

*NL*
If
Valentine
could
have
seen
the
trembling
step
and
agitated
countenance
*NL*
of
Franz
when
he
quitted
the
chamber
of
M.
Noirtier
,
even
she
would
have
*NL*
been
constrained
to
pity
him
.
Villefort
had
only
just
given
utterance
*NL*
to
a
few
incoherent
sentences
,
and
then
retired
to
his
study
,
where
he
*NL*
received
about
two
hours
afterwards
the
following
letter
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
After
all
the
disclosures
which
were
made
this
morning
,
M.
Noirtier
de
*NL*
Villefort
must
see
the
utter
impossibility
of
any
alliance
being
formed
*NL*
between
his
family
and
that
of
M.
Franz
d'Epinay
.
M.
d'Epinay
must
say
*NL*
that
he
is
shocked
and
astonished
that
M.
de
Villefort
,
who
appeared
to
*NL*
be
aware
of
all
the
circumstances
detailed
this
morning
,
should
not
have
*NL*
anticipated
him
in
this
announcement
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
No
one
who
had
seen
the
magistrate
at
this
moment
,
so
thoroughly
*NL*
unnerved
by
the
recent
inauspicious
combination
of
circumstances
,
would
*NL*
have
supposed
for
an
instant
that
he
had
anticipated
the
annoyance
;
*NL*
although
it
certainly
never
had
occurred
to
him
that
his
father
would
*NL*
carry
candor
,
or
rather
rudeness
,
so
far
as
to
relate
such
a
history
.
*NL*
And
in
justice
to
Villefort
,
it
must
be
understood
that
M.
Noirtier
,
*NL*
who
never
cared
for
the
opinion
of
his
son
on
any
subject
,
had
always
*NL*
omitted
to
explain
the
affair
to
Villefort
,
so
that
he
had
all
his
life
*NL*
entertained
the
belief
that
General
de
Quesnel
,
or
the
Baron
d'Epinay
,
*NL*
as
he
was
alternately
styled
,
according
as
the
speaker
wished
to
*NL*
identify
him
by
his
own
family
name
,
or
by
the
title
which
had
been
*NL*
conferred
on
him
,
fell
the
victim
of
assassination
,
and
not
that
he
was
*NL*
killed
fairly
in
a
duel
.
This
harsh
letter
,
coming
as
it
did
from
a
man
*NL*
generally
so
polite
and
respectful
,
struck
a
mortal
blow
at
the
pride
*NL*
of
Villefort
.
Hardly
had
he
read
the
letter
,
when
his
wife
entered
.
The
*NL*
sudden
departure
of
Franz
,
after
being
summoned
by
M.
Noirtier
,
had
so
*NL*
much
astonished
every
one
,
that
the
position
of
Madame
de
Villefort
,
*NL*
left
alone
with
the
notary
and
the
witnesses
,
became
every
moment
more
*NL*
embarrassing
.
Determined
to
bear
it
no
longer
,
she
arose
and
left
the
*NL*
room
;
saying
she
would
go
and
make
some
inquiries
into
the
cause
of
his
*NL*
sudden
disappearance
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
de
Villefort
's
communications
on
the
subject
were
very
limited
and
*NL*
concise
;
he
told
her
,
in
fact
,
that
an
explanation
had
taken
place
*NL*
between
M.
Noirtier
,
M.
d'Epinay
,
and
himself
,
and
that
the
marriage
*NL*
of
Valentine
and
Franz
would
consequently
be
broken
off
.
This
was
*NL*
an
awkward
and
unpleasant
thing
to
have
to
report
to
those
who
were
*NL*
awaiting
her
return
in
the
chamber
of
her
father-in-law
.
She
*NL*
therefore
contented
herself
with
saying
that
M.
Noirtier
having
at
the
*NL*
commencement
of
the
discussion
been
attacked
by
a
sort
of
apoplectic
*NL*
fit
,
the
affair
would
necessarily
be
deferred
for
some
days
longer
.
This
*NL*
news
,
false
as
it
was
following
so
singularly
in
the
train
of
the
two
*NL*
similar
misfortunes
which
had
so
recently
occurred
,
evidently
astonished
*NL*
the
auditors
,
and
they
retired
without
a
word
.
During
this
time
*NL*
Valentine
,
at
once
terrified
and
happy
,
after
having
embraced
and
*NL*
thanked
the
feeble
old
man
for
thus
breaking
with
a
single
blow
the
*NL*
chain
which
she
had
been
accustomed
to
consider
as
irrefragable
,
asked
*NL*
leave
to
retire
to
her
own
room
,
in
order
to
recover
her
composure
.
*NL*
Noirtier
looked
the
permission
which
she
solicited
.
But
instead
of
going
*NL*
to
her
own
room
,
Valentine
,
having
once
gained
her
liberty
,
entered
the
*NL*
gallery
,
and
,
opening
a
small
door
at
the
end
of
it
,
found
herself
at
*NL*
once
in
the
garden
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
midst
of
all
the
strange
events
which
had
crowded
one
on
the
*NL*
other
,
an
indefinable
sentiment
of
dread
had
taken
possession
of
*NL*
Valentine
's
mind
.
She
expected
every
moment
that
she
should
see
Morrel
*NL*
appear
,
pale
and
trembling
,
to
forbid
the
signing
of
the
contract
,
like
*NL*
the
Laird
of
Ravenswood
in
``
The
Bride
of
Lammermoor
.
''
It
was
high
time
*NL*
for
her
to
make
her
appearance
at
the
gate
,
for
Maximilian
had
long
*NL*
awaited
her
coming
.
He
had
half
guessed
what
was
going
on
when
he
saw
*NL*
Franz
quit
the
cemetery
with
M.
de
Villefort
.
He
followed
M.
d'Epinay
,
*NL*
saw
him
enter
,
afterwards
go
out
,
and
then
re-enter
with
Albert
and
*NL*
Chateau-Renaud
.
He
had
no
longer
any
doubts
as
to
the
nature
of
the
*NL*
conference
;
he
therefore
quickly
went
to
the
gate
in
the
clover-patch
,
*NL*
prepared
to
hear
the
result
of
the
proceedings
,
and
very
certain
that
*NL*
Valentine
would
hasten
to
him
the
first
moment
she
should
be
set
at
*NL*
liberty
.
He
was
not
mistaken
;
peering
through
the
crevices
of
the
wooden
*NL*
partition
,
he
soon
discovered
the
young
girl
,
who
cast
aside
all
her
*NL*
usual
precautions
and
walked
at
once
to
the
barrier
.
The
first
glance
*NL*
which
Maximilian
directed
towards
her
entirely
reassured
him
,
and
the
*NL*
first
words
she
spoke
made
his
heart
bound
with
delight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
saved
!
''
said
Valentine
.
``
Saved
?
''
repeated
Morrel
,
not
being
able
*NL*
to
conceive
such
intense
happiness
;
``
by
whom
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
my
grandfather
.
Oh
,
Morrel
,
pray
love
him
for
all
his
goodness
to
*NL*
us
!
''
Morrel
swore
to
love
him
with
all
his
soul
;
and
at
that
moment
he
*NL*
could
safely
promise
to
do
so
,
for
he
felt
as
though
it
were
not
enough
*NL*
to
love
him
merely
as
a
friend
or
even
as
a
father
.
``
But
tell
me
,
*NL*
Valentine
,
how
has
it
all
been
effected
?
What
strange
means
has
he
used
*NL*
to
compass
this
blessed
end
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Valentine
was
on
the
point
of
relating
all
that
had
passed
,
but
she
*NL*
suddenly
remembered
that
in
doing
so
she
must
reveal
a
terrible
secret
*NL*
which
concerned
others
as
well
as
her
grandfather
,
and
she
said
,
``
At
*NL*
some
future
time
I
will
tell
you
all
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
when
will
that
be
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
I
am
your
wife
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
conversation
had
now
turned
upon
a
topic
so
pleasing
to
Morrel
,
*NL*
that
he
was
ready
to
accede
to
anything
that
Valentine
thought
fit
to
*NL*
propose
,
and
he
likewise
felt
that
a
piece
of
intelligence
such
as
he
*NL*
just
heard
ought
to
be
more
than
sufficient
to
content
him
for
one
day
.
*NL*
However
,
he
would
not
leave
without
the
promise
of
seeing
Valentine
*NL*
again
the
next
night
.
Valentine
promised
all
that
Morrel
required
of
*NL*
her
,
and
certainly
it
was
less
difficult
now
for
her
to
believe
that
she
*NL*
should
marry
Maximilian
than
it
was
an
hour
ago
to
assure
herself
that
*NL*
she
should
not
marry
Franz
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
time
occupied
by
the
interview
we
have
just
detailed
,
Madame
*NL*
de
Villefort
had
gone
to
visit
M.
Noirtier
.
The
old
man
looked
at
her
*NL*
with
that
stern
and
forbidding
expression
with
which
he
was
accustomed
*NL*
to
receive
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
,
''
said
she
,
``
it
is
superfluous
for
me
to
tell
you
that
Valentine
's
*NL*
marriage
is
broken
off
,
since
it
was
here
that
the
affair
was
*NL*
concluded
.
''
Noirtier
's
countenance
remained
immovable
.
``
But
one
thing
*NL*
I
can
tell
you
,
of
which
I
do
not
think
you
are
aware
;
that
is
,
that
*NL*
I
have
always
been
opposed
to
this
marriage
,
and
that
the
contract
*NL*
was
entered
into
entirely
without
my
consent
or
approbation
.
''
Noirtier
*NL*
regarded
his
daughter-in-law
with
the
look
of
a
man
desiring
an
*NL*
explanation
.
``
Now
that
this
marriage
,
which
I
know
you
so
much
disliked
,
*NL*
is
done
away
with
,
I
come
to
you
on
an
errand
which
neither
M.
de
*NL*
Villefort
nor
Valentine
could
consistently
undertake
.
''
Noirtier
's
*NL*
eyes
demanded
the
nature
of
her
mission
.
``
I
come
to
entreat
you
,
sir
,
''
*NL*
continued
Madame
de
Villefort
,
``
as
the
only
one
who
has
the
right
of
*NL*
doing
so
,
inasmuch
as
I
am
the
only
one
who
will
receive
no
personal
*NL*
benefit
from
the
transaction
,
--
I
come
to
entreat
you
to
restore
,
not
*NL*
your
love
,
for
that
she
has
always
possessed
,
but
to
restore
your
*NL*
fortune
to
your
granddaughter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
doubtful
expression
in
Noirtier
's
eyes
;
he
was
evidently
*NL*
trying
to
discover
the
motive
of
this
proceeding
,
and
he
could
not
*NL*
succeed
in
doing
so
.
``
May
I
hope
,
sir
,
''
said
Madame
de
Villefort
,
``
that
*NL*
your
intentions
accord
with
my
request
?
''
Noirtier
made
a
sign
that
they
*NL*
did
.
``
In
that
case
,
sir
,
''
rejoined
Madame
de
Villefort
,
``
I
will
leave
*NL*
you
overwhelmed
with
gratitude
and
happiness
at
your
prompt
acquiescence
*NL*
to
my
wishes
.
''
She
then
bowed
to
M.
Noirtier
and
retired
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
M.
Noirtier
sent
for
the
notary
;
the
first
will
was
torn
*NL*
up
and
a
second
made
,
in
which
he
left
the
whole
of
his
fortune
to
*NL*
Valentine
,
on
condition
that
she
should
never
be
separated
from
him
.
It
*NL*
was
then
generally
reported
that
Mademoiselle
de
Villefort
,
the
heiress
*NL*
of
the
marquis
and
marchioness
of
Saint-Meran
,
had
regained
the
*NL*
good
graces
of
her
grandfather
,
and
that
she
would
ultimately
be
in
*NL*
possession
of
an
income
of
300,000
livres
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
all
the
proceedings
relative
to
the
dissolution
of
the
*NL*
marriage-contract
were
being
carried
on
at
the
house
of
M.
de
Villefort
,
*NL*
Monte
Cristo
had
paid
his
visit
to
the
Count
of
Morcerf
,
who
,
in
order
*NL*
to
lose
no
time
in
responding
to
M.
Danglars
'
wishes
,
and
at
the
same
*NL*
time
to
pay
all
due
deference
to
his
position
in
society
,
donned
his
*NL*
uniform
of
lieutenant-general
,
which
he
ornamented
with
all
his
crosses
,
*NL*
and
thus
attired
,
ordered
his
finest
horses
and
drove
to
the
Rue
de
la
*NL*
Chausse
d'Antin
.
*NL*
*NL*
Danglars
was
balancing
his
monthly
accounts
,
and
it
was
perhaps
not
the
*NL*
most
favorable
moment
for
finding
him
in
his
best
humor
.
At
the
first
*NL*
sight
of
his
old
friend
,
Danglars
assumed
his
majestic
air
,
and
settled
*NL*
himself
in
his
easy-chair
.
Morcerf
,
usually
so
stiff
and
formal
,
*NL*
accosted
the
banker
in
an
affable
and
smiling
manner
,
and
,
feeling
sure
*NL*
that
the
overture
he
was
about
to
make
would
be
well
received
,
he
did
not
*NL*
consider
it
necessary
to
adopt
any
manoeuvres
in
order
to
gain
his
end
,
*NL*
but
went
at
once
straight
to
the
point
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
baron
,
''
said
he
,
``
here
I
am
at
last
;
some
time
has
elapsed
since
*NL*
our
plans
were
formed
,
and
they
are
not
yet
executed
.
''
Morcerf
paused
at
*NL*
these
words
,
quietly
waiting
till
the
cloud
should
have
dispersed
which
*NL*
had
gathered
on
the
brow
of
Danglars
,
and
which
he
attributed
to
his
*NL*
silence
;
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
to
his
great
surprise
,
it
grew
darker
and
*NL*
darker
.
``
To
what
do
you
allude
,
monsieur
?
''
said
Danglars
;
as
if
he
were
*NL*
trying
in
vain
to
guess
at
the
possible
meaning
of
the
general
's
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
said
Morcerf
,
``
I
see
you
are
a
stickler
for
forms
,
my
dear
sir
,
*NL*
and
you
would
remind
me
that
the
ceremonial
rites
should
not
be
omitted
.
*NL*
Ma
foi
,
I
beg
your
pardon
,
but
as
I
have
but
one
son
,
and
it
is
the
*NL*
first
time
I
have
ever
thought
of
marrying
him
,
I
am
still
serving
*NL*
my
apprenticeship
,
you
know
;
come
,
I
will
reform
.
''
And
Morcerf
with
a
*NL*
forced
smile
arose
,
and
,
making
a
low
bow
to
M.
Danglars
,
said
:
``
Baron
,
*NL*
I
have
the
honor
of
asking
of
you
the
hand
of
Mademoiselle
Eugenie
*NL*
Danglars
for
my
son
,
the
Vicomte
Albert
de
Morcerf
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Danglars
,
instead
of
receiving
this
address
in
the
favorable
manner
*NL*
which
Morcerf
had
expected
,
knit
his
brow
,
and
without
inviting
the
*NL*
count
,
who
was
still
standing
,
to
take
a
seat
,
he
said
:
``
Monsieur
,
it
*NL*
will
be
necessary
to
reflect
before
I
give
you
an
answer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
reflect
?
''
said
Morcerf
,
more
and
more
astonished
;
``
have
you
not
had
*NL*
enough
time
for
reflection
during
the
eight
years
which
have
elapsed
*NL*
since
this
marriage
was
first
discussed
between
us
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Count
,
''
said
the
banker
,
``
things
are
constantly
occurring
in
the
world
*NL*
to
induce
us
to
lay
aside
our
most
established
opinions
,
or
at
*NL*
all
events
to
cause
us
to
remodel
them
according
to
the
change
of
*NL*
circumstances
,
which
may
have
placed
affairs
in
a
totally
different
*NL*
light
to
that
in
which
we
at
first
viewed
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
understand
you
,
baron
,
''
said
Morcerf
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
I
mean
to
say
is
this
,
sir
,

that
during
the
last
fortnight
*NL*
unforeseen
circumstances
have
occurred
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excuse
me
,
''
said
Morcerf
,
``
but
is
it
a
play
we
are
acting
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
play
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
for
it
is
like
one
;
pray
let
us
come
more
to
the
point
,
and
*NL*
endeavor
thoroughly
to
understand
each
other
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
quite
my
desire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
seen
M.
de
Monte
Cristo
have
you
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
him
very
often
,
''
said
Danglars
,
drawing
himself
up
;
``
he
is
a
*NL*
particular
friend
of
mine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
in
one
of
your
late
conversations
with
him
,
you
said
that
I
*NL*
appeared
to
be
forgetful
and
irresolute
concerning
this
marriage
,
did
*NL*
you
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
say
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
here
I
am
,
proving
at
once
that
I
am
really
neither
the
one
nor
*NL*
the
other
,
by
entreating
you
to
keep
your
promise
on
that
score
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Danglars
did
not
answer
.
``
Have
you
so
soon
changed
your
mind
,
''
added
*NL*
Morcerf
,
``
or
have
you
only
provoked
my
request
that
you
may
have
the
*NL*
pleasure
of
seeing
me
humbled
?
''
Danglars
,
seeing
that
if
he
continued
*NL*
the
conversation
in
the
same
tone
in
which
he
had
begun
it
,
the
whole
*NL*
thing
might
turn
out
to
his
own
disadvantage
,
turned
to
Morcerf
,
and
*NL*
said
:
``
Count
,
you
must
doubtless
be
surprised
at
my
reserve
,
and
I
*NL*
assure
you
it
costs
me
much
to
act
in
such
a
manner
towards
you
;
but
,
*NL*
believe
me
when
I
say
that
imperative
necessity
has
imposed
the
painful
*NL*
task
upon
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
These
are
all
so
many
empty
words
,
my
dear
sir
,
''
said
Morcerf
:
``
they
*NL*
might
satisfy
a
new
acquaintance
,
but
the
Comte
de
Morcerf
does
not
rank
*NL*
in
that
list
;
and
when
a
man
like
him
comes
to
another
,
recalls
to
him
*NL*
his
plighted
word
,
and
this
man
fails
to
redeem
the
pledge
,
he
has
at
*NL*
least
a
right
to
exact
from
him
a
good
reason
for
so
doing
.
''
Danglars
*NL*
was
a
coward
,
but
did
not
wish
to
appear
so
;
he
was
piqued
at
the
tone
*NL*
which
Morcerf
had
just
assumed
.
``
I
am
not
without
a
good
reason
for
my
*NL*
conduct
,
''
replied
the
banker
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
to
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
mean
to
say
that
I
have
a
good
reason

that
it
is
difficult
to
*NL*
explain
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
be
aware
,
at
all
events
,
that
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
*NL*
understand
motives
before
they
are
explained
to
me
;
but
one
thing
at
*NL*
least
is
clear
,
which
is
,
that
you
decline
allying
yourself
with
my
*NL*
family
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
,
''
said
Danglars
;
``
I
merely
suspend
my
decision
,
that
is
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
do
you
really
flatter
yourself
that
I
shall
yield
to
all
your
*NL*
caprices
,
and
quietly
and
humbly
await
the
time
of
again
being
received
*NL*
into
your
good
graces
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
count
,
if
you
will
not
wait
,
we
must
look
upon
these
projects
*NL*
as
if
they
had
never
been
entertained
.
''
The
count
bit
his
lips
till
the
*NL*
blood
almost
started
,
to
prevent
the
ebullition
of
anger
which
his
proud
*NL*
and
irritable
temper
scarcely
allowed
him
to
restrain
;
understanding
,
*NL*
however
,
that
in
the
present
state
of
things
the
laugh
would
decidedly
*NL*
be
against
him
,
he
turned
from
the
door
,
towards
which
he
had
been
*NL*
directing
his
steps
,
and
again
confronted
the
banker
.
A
cloud
settled
*NL*
on
his
brow
,
evincing
decided
anxiety
and
uneasiness
,
instead
of
the
*NL*
expression
of
offended
pride
which
had
lately
reigned
there
.
``
My
dear
*NL*
Danglars
,
''
said
Morcerf
,
``
we
have
been
acquainted
for
many
years
,
and
*NL*
consequently
we
ought
to
make
some
allowance
for
each
other
's
failings
.
*NL*
You
owe
me
an
explanation
,
and
really
it
is
but
fair
that
I
should
know
*NL*
what
circumstance
has
occurred
to
deprive
my
son
of
your
favor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
from
no
personal
ill-feeling
towards
the
viscount
,
that
is
all
I
*NL*
can
say
,
sir
,
''
replied
Danglars
,
who
resumed
his
insolent
manner
as
soon
*NL*
as
he
perceived
that
Morcerf
was
a
little
softened
and
calmed
down
.
``
And
*NL*
towards
whom
do
you
bear
this
personal
ill-feeling
,
then
?
''
said
Morcerf
,
*NL*
turning
pale
with
anger
.
The
expression
of
the
count
's
face
had
not
*NL*
remained
unperceived
by
the
banker
;
he
fixed
on
him
a
look
of
greater
*NL*
assurance
than
before
,
and
said
:
``
You
may
,
perhaps
,
be
better
satisfied
*NL*
that
I
should
not
go
farther
into
particulars
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
tremor
of
suppressed
rage
shook
the
whole
frame
of
the
count
,
and
*NL*
making
a
violent
effort
over
himself
,
he
said
:
``
I
have
a
right
to
*NL*
insist
on
your
giving
me
an
explanation
.
Is
it
Madame
de
Morcerf
who
*NL*
has
displeased
you
?
Is
it
my
fortune
which
you
find
insufficient
?
Is
it
*NL*
because
my
opinions
differ
from
yours
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
of
the
kind
,
sir
,
''
replied
Danglars
:
``
if
such
had
been
the
*NL*
case
,
I
only
should
have
been
to
blame
,
inasmuch
as
I
was
aware
of
all
*NL*
these
things
when
I
made
the
engagement
.
No
,
do
not
seek
any
longer
to
*NL*
discover
the
reason
.
I
really
am
quite
ashamed
to
have
been
the
cause
of
*NL*
your
undergoing
such
severe
self-examination
;
let
us
drop
the
subject
,
*NL*
and
adopt
the
middle
course
of
delay
,
which
implies
neither
a
rupture
*NL*
nor
an
engagement
.
Ma
foi
,
there
is
no
hurry
.
My
daughter
is
only
*NL*
seventeen
years
old
,
and
your
son
twenty-one
.
While
we
wait
,
time
will
*NL*
be
progressing
,
events
will
succeed
each
other
;
things
which
in
the
*NL*
evening
look
dark
and
obscure
,
appear
but
too
clearly
in
the
light
of
*NL*
morning
,
and
sometimes
the
utterance
of
one
word
,
or
the
lapse
of
a
*NL*
single
day
,
will
reveal
the
most
cruel
calumnies
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Calumnies
,
did
you
say
,
sir
?
''
cried
Morcerf
,
turning
livid
with
rage
.
*NL*
``
Does
any
one
dare
to
slander
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
,
I
told
you
that
I
considered
it
best
to
avoid
all
*NL*
explanation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
sir
,
I
am
patiently
to
submit
to
your
refusal
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
,
although
I
assure
you
the
refusal
is
as
painful
for
me
to
*NL*
give
as
it
is
for
you
to
receive
,
for
I
had
reckoned
on
the
honor
*NL*
of
your
alliance
,
and
the
breaking
off
of
a
marriage
contract
always
*NL*
injures
the
lady
more
than
the
gentleman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Enough
,
sir
,
''
said
Morcerf
,
``
we
will
speak
no
more
on
the
subject
.
''
And
*NL*
clutching
his
gloves
in
anger
,
he
left
the
apartment
.
Danglars
observed
*NL*
that
during
the
whole
conversation
Morcerf
had
never
once
dared
to
*NL*
ask
if
it
was
on
his
own
account
that
Danglars
recalled
his
word
.
*NL*
That
evening
he
had
a
long
conference
with
several
friends
;
and
M.
*NL*
Cavalcanti
,
who
had
remained
in
the
drawing-room
with
the
ladies
,
was
*NL*
the
last
to
leave
the
banker
's
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
morning
,
as
soon
as
he
awoke
,
Danglars
asked
for
the
*NL*
newspapers
;
they
were
brought
to
him
;
he
laid
aside
three
or
four
,
and
*NL*
at
last
fixed
on
the
Impartial
,
the
paper
of
which
Beauchamp
was
the
*NL*
chief
editor
.
He
hastily
tore
off
the
cover
,
opened
the
journal
with
*NL*
nervous
precipitation
,
passed
contemptuously
over
the
Paris
jottings
,
*NL*
and
arriving
at
the
miscellaneous
intelligence
,
stopped
with
a
malicious
*NL*
smile
,
at
a
paragraph
headed
``
We
hear
from
Yanina
.
''
``
Very
good
,
''
*NL*
observed
Danglars
,
after
having
read
the
paragraph
;
``
here
is
a
little
*NL*
article
on
Colonel
Fernand
,
which
,
if
I
am
not
mistaken
,
would
render
*NL*
the
explanation
which
the
Comte
de
Morcerf
required
of
me
perfectly
*NL*
unnecessary
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
same
moment
,
that
is
,
at
nine
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
Albert
de
*NL*
Morcerf
,
dressed
in
a
black
coat
buttoned
up
to
his
chin
,
might
have
*NL*
been
seen
walking
with
a
quick
and
agitated
step
in
the
direction
of
*NL*
Monte
Cristo
's
house
in
the
Champs
Elysees
.
When
he
presented
himself
at
*NL*
the
gate
the
porter
informed
him
that
the
Count
had
gone
out
about
half
*NL*
an
hour
previously
.
``
Did
he
take
Baptistin
with
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
my
lord
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Call
him
,
then
;
I
wish
to
speak
to
him
.
''
The
concierge
went
to
seek
the
*NL*
valet
de
chambre
,
and
returned
with
him
in
an
instant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
good
friend
,
''
said
Albert
,
``
I
beg
pardon
for
my
intrusion
,
but
I
*NL*
was
anxious
to
know
from
your
own
mouth
if
your
master
was
really
out
or
*NL*
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
really
out

''
replied
Baptistin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Out
,
even
to
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
how
happy
my
master
always
is
to
receive
the
vicomte
,
''
said
*NL*
Baptistin
;
``
and
I
should
therefore
never
think
of
including
him
in
any
*NL*
general
order
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
right
;
and
now
I
wish
to
see
him
on
an
affair
of
great
*NL*
importance

Do
you
think
it
will
be
long
before
he
comes
in
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
think
not
,
for
he
ordered
his
breakfast
at
ten
o'clock
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
will
go
and
take
a
turn
in
the
Champs
Elysees
,
and
at
ten
*NL*
o'clock
I
will
return
here
;
meanwhile
,
if
the
count
should
come
in
,
will
*NL*
you
beg
him
not
to
go
out
again
without
seeing
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
depend
on
my
doing
so
,
sir
,
''
said
Baptistin
.
*NL*
*NL*
Albert
left
the
cab
in
which
he
had
come
at
the
count
's
door
,
intending
*NL*
to
take
a
turn
on
foot
.
As
he
was
passing
the
Allee
des
Veuves
,
he
*NL*
thought
he
saw
the
count
's
horses
standing
at
Gosset
's
shooting-gallery
;
*NL*
he
approached
,
and
soon
recognized
the
coachman
.
``
Is
the
count
shooting
*NL*
in
the
gallery
?
''
said
Morcerf
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
,
''
replied
the
coachman
.
While
he
was
speaking
,
Albert
had
*NL*
heard
the
report
of
two
or
three
pistol-shots
.
He
entered
,
and
on
his
*NL*
way
met
the
waiter
.
``
Excuse
me
,
my
lord
,
''
said
the
lad
;
``
but
will
you
*NL*
have
the
kindness
to
wait
a
moment
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
for

Philip
?
''
asked
Albert
,
who
,
being
a
constant
visitor
there

*NL*
``

*NL*
``
Not

And
Philip

urged

entered

a
second

Monte

appeared
on
the

Albert

your

I
did
so

I
alone
am
to
blame

went
to

told

out

that

expected

home

I
was
walking

about
in

pass
away

ten
o'clock

caught

*NL*

*NL*
``
No

The
count
turned
*NL*
up
his
sleeves
,
and
passed
into
the
little
vestibule
where
the
gentlemen
*NL*
were
accustomed
to
wash
their
hands
after
shooting
.
``
Come
in
,
my
lord

*NL*

Philip
in
a
low
tone
,
``

I
will
show
you
something

*NL*
Morcerf
entered
,
and
in
place
of
the
usual
target
,
he
saw
some
*NL*
playing-cards
fixed
against
the
wall
.
At
a
distance
Albert
thought
it
*NL*
was
a
complete
suit
,
for
he
counted
from
the
ace
to
the
ten
.
``
Ah
,
ha
,
''
*NL*
said
Albert
,
``
I
see
you
were
preparing
for
a
game
of
cards

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

''
said
the
count
,
``
I
was
making
a
suit

*NL*
*NL*
``
How
?
''
said
Albert
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Those
are
really
aces

twos

you
see

into

sevens

eights

nines
,
and
tens

''
Albert
*NL*
approached
.
In
fact
,
the
bullets
had
actually
pierced
the
cards
in
the
*NL*
exact
places
which
the
painted
signs
would
otherwise
have
occupied
,
the
*NL*
lines
and
distances
being
as
regularly
kept
as
if
they
had
been
ruled
*NL*
with

``
Diable

said
Morcerf
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
would
you
have

said
Monte
Cristo
,
wiping
his
*NL*
hands
on
the
towel
which
Ali
had
brought
him
;
``
I
must
occupy
my
leisure
*NL*
moments

Both
men
*NL*
entered
Monte
Cristo
's
carriage
,
which
in
the
course
of
a
few
minutes
*NL*
deposited
them
safely
at
No.

Monte
Cristo
took
Albert
into
his
*NL*
study
,
and
pointing
to
a
seat
,
placed
another
for
himself
.
``
Now
let
us
*NL*
talk
the

over
quietly

said
the
count
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

said
Albert

*NL*

And
Albert
handed
over
the
paper
to
the
count
,
who
read
as
*NL*
follows
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
correspondent

up

Morcerf
took
his
*NL*
hat
,
and
left
the
room
.
He
found
his
carriage
at
the
door
,
and
doing
his
*NL*
utmost
to
restrain
his
anger
he
went
at
once
to
find
Beauchamp
,
who
*NL*
was
in
his
office
.
It
was
a
gloomy
,
dusty-looking
apartment
,
such
as
*NL*
journalists
'
offices
have
always
been
from
time
immemorial
.
The
servant
*NL*
announced
M.
Albert
de
Morcerf
.
Beauchamp
repeated
the
name
to
himself
,
*NL*
as
though
he
could
scarcely
believe
that
he
had
heard
aright
,
and
then
*NL*
gave
orders
for
him
to
be
admitted
.
Albert
entered
.
Beauchamp
uttered
an
*NL*
exclamation
of
surprise
on
seeing
his
friend
leap
over
and
trample
under
*NL*
foot
all
the
newspapers
which
were
strewed
about
the
room
.
``
This
way
,
*NL*
this
way

Albert

said
he
,
holding
out
his
hand
to
the
young
*NL*
man
.
``
Are
you
out
of
your
senses
,
or
do
you
come
peaceably
to
take
*NL*
breakfast
with
me
?
Try
and
find
a
seat
--
there
is
one
by
that
geranium
,
*NL*
which
is
the
only
thing
in
the
room
to
remind
me
that
there
are
other
*NL*
leaves
in
the
world
besides
leaves
of

*NL*

*NL*

*NL*

with

Albert
.
*NL*
*NL*
Beauchamp
took
the
paper
,
and
read
the
article
to
which
Albert
pointed
*NL*
in
an
undertone
.
``
You
see
it
is
a
serious
annoyance
,

said
Morcerf
,
when
*NL*
Beauchamp
had
finished
the
perusal
of
the
paragraph
.
``
Is
the
officer
*NL*
referred
to
a
relation

then

demanded
the
journalist
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

said
Albert
,
blushing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

do
you

me
to
do

said
Beauchamp
mildly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My

Beauchamp

I
wish
you

contradict

Beauchamp
*NL*
looked
at
Albert
with
a
benevolent
expression
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come

said
he
,
``
this

will
want

you
know
.
Sit
down
,
and
I
will
*NL*
read
it
again
.
''
Albert
resumed
his
seat
,
and
Beauchamp
read
,
with
more
*NL*
attention
than
at
first
,
the
lines
denounced
by
his
friend
.
``
Well
,
''
said
*NL*
Albert
in
a
determined
tone
,
``
you
see
that
your

the

rising
.
``
I

long
enough

''
continued
Albert
,
biting
his
lips
*NL*
convulsively
,
for
he
saw
that
Beauchamp
's
anger
was
beginning
to
*NL*
rise
,

``
you

point

*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
have
been
your

almost
lead

forget
that
I
ever
bore
that
title

But
wait
a
*NL*
moment

do
not
let
us
get
angry

at

not
yet

vexed

me
how
this
Fernand

related

*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
merely
my

Albert

honorable
scars
they
would
denounce
as
badges
of
disgrace

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
your

said
Beauchamp
;
``

can
well
understand
your
indignation

will
look
at
it
*NL*
again

and
he
read
the
paragraph
for
the
third
time
,
laying
a
stress
*NL*
on
each
word
as
he
proceeded
.
``
But
the
paper
nowhere
identifies

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

At
the
words
``
I
will

Beauchamp
*NL*
steadily
raised
his
eyes
to
Albert
's
countenance
,
and
then
as
gradually
*NL*
lowering
them
,
he
remained
thoughtful
for
a
few
moments
.
``
You
will
*NL*
retract
this
assertion

you
not

said
Albert
with
*NL*
increased
though
stifled
anger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

replied
Beauchamp
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Immediately

Albert
.

*NL*
``

am
convinced

``

``

*NL*
``

there
to

Albert
,
enraged
beyond
*NL*
measure
at
Beauchamp

last
remark
.
``
If

not

contrary

Beauchamp
looked
at
Albert
*NL*
with
the
smile
which
was
so
peculiar
to
him
,
and
which
in
its
numerous
*NL*
modifications
served
to
express
every
varied
emotion
of
his
mind
.
``

he
,

will
,
therefore
,
be
the
conclusion
of
the
term
agreed
on
,
and
till
that
*NL*
time
arrives
--
and
it
is
the
advice
of
a
gentleman
which
I
am
about
to
*NL*
give
you
--
till
then
we
will
refrain
from
growling
and
barking
like
two
*NL*
dogs
chained
within
sight
of
each
other
.
''
When
he
had
concluded
his
*NL*
speech
,
Beauchamp
bowed
coldly
to
Albert
,
turned
his
back
upon
him
,
and
*NL*
went
to
the
press-room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Albert
vented
his
anger
on
a
pile
of
newspapers
,
which
he
sent
flying
*NL*
all
over
the
office
by
switching
them
violently
with
his
stick
;
after
*NL*
which
ebullition
he
departed
--
not
,
however
,
without
walking
several
*NL*
times
to
the
door
of
the
press-room
,
as
if
he
had
half
a
mind
to
enter
.
*NL*
While
Albert
was
lashing
the
front
of
his
carriage
in
the
same
manner
*NL*
that
he
had
the
newspapers
which
were
the
innocent
agents
of
his
*NL*
discomfiture
,
as
he
was
crossing
the
barrier
he
perceived
Morrel
,
who
*NL*
was
walking
with
a
quick
step
and
a
bright
eye
.
He
was
passing
the
*NL*
Chinese
Baths
,
and
appeared
to
have
come
from
the
direction
of
the
Porte
*NL*
Saint-Martin
,
and
to
be
going
towards
the
Madeleine
.
``
Ah
,
''
said
Morcerf
,
*NL*
``
there
goes
a
happy
man
!
''
And
it
so
happened
Albert
was
not
mistaken
in
*NL*
his
opinion
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
79
.
The
Lemonade
.
*NL*
*NL*
Morrel
was
,
in
fact
,
very
happy
.
M.
Noirtier
had
just
sent
for
him
,
and
*NL*
he
was
in
such
haste
to
know
the
reason
of
his
doing
so
that
he
had
not
*NL*
stopped
to
take
a
cab
,
placing
infinitely
more
dependence
on
his
own
two
*NL*
legs
than
on
the
four
legs
of
a
cab-horse
.
He
had
therefore
set
off
at
*NL*
a
furious
rate
from
the
Rue
Meslay
,
and
was
hastening
with
rapid
strides
*NL*
in
the
direction
of
the
Faubourg
Saint-Honore
.
Morrel
advanced
with
*NL*
a
firm
,
manly
tread
,
and
poor
Barrois
followed
him
as
he
best
might
.
*NL*
Morrel
was
only
thirty-one
,
Barrois
was
sixty
years
of
age
;
Morrel
was
*NL*
deeply
in
love
,
and
Barrois
was
dying
with
heat
and
exertion
.
These
*NL*
two
men
,
thus
opposed
in
age
and
interests
,
resembled
two
parts
of
*NL*
a
triangle
,
presenting
the
extremes
of
separation
,
yet
nevertheless
*NL*
possessing
their
point
of
union
.
This
point
of
union
was
Noirtier
,
and
*NL*
it
was
he
who
had
just
sent
for
Morrel
,
with
the
request
that
the
latter
*NL*
would
lose
no
time
in
coming
to
him
--
a
command
which
Morrel
obeyed
to
*NL*
the
letter
,
to
the
great
discomfiture
of
Barrois
.
On
arriving
at
the
*NL*
house
,
Morrel
was
not
even
out
of
breath
,
for
love
lends
wings
to
our
*NL*
desires
;
but
Barrois
,
who
had
long
forgotten
what
it
was
to
love
,
was
*NL*
sorely
fatigued
by
the
expedition
he
had
been
constrained
to
use
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
servant
introduced
Morrel
by
a
private
entrance
,
closed
the
door
*NL*
of
the
study
,
and
soon
the
rustling
of
a
dress
announced
the
arrival
of
*NL*
Valentine
.
She
looked
marvellously
beautiful
in
her
deep
mourning
dress
,
*NL*
and
Morrel
experienced
such
intense
delight
in
gazing
upon
her
that
he
*NL*
felt
as
if
he
could
almost
have
dispensed
with
the
conversation
of
her
*NL*
grandfather
.
But
the
easy-chair
of
the
old
man
was
heard
rolling
*NL*
along
the
floor
,
and
he
soon
made
his
appearance
in
the
room
.
Noirtier
*NL*
acknowledged
by
a
look
of
extreme
kindness
and
benevolence
the
thanks
*NL*
which
Morrel
lavished
on
him
for
his
timely
intervention
on
behalf
*NL*
of
Valentine
and
himself
--
an
intervention
which
had
saved
them
from
*NL*
despair
.
Morrel
then
cast
on
the
invalid
an
interrogative
look
as
to
the
*NL*
new
favor
which
he
designed
to
bestow
on
him
.
Valentine
was
sitting
at
*NL*
a
little
distance
from
them
,
timidly
awaiting
the
moment
when
she
should
*NL*
be
obliged
to
speak
.
Noirtier
fixed
his
eyes
on
her
.
``
Am
I
to
say
what
*NL*
you
told
me
?
''
asked
Valentine
.
Noirtier
made
a
sign
that
she
was
to
do
*NL*
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
Morrel
,
''
said
Valentine
to
the
young
man
,
who
was
regarding
*NL*
her
with
the
most
intense
interest
,
``
my
grandfather
,
M.
Noirtier
,
had
a
*NL*
thousand
things
to
say
,
which
he
told
me
three
days
ago
;
and
now
,
he
has
*NL*
sent
for
you
,
that
I
may
repeat
them
to
you
.
I
will
repeat
them
,
then
;
*NL*
and
since
he
has
chosen
me
as
his
interpreter
,
I
will
be
faithful
to
the
*NL*
trust
,
and
will
not
alter
a
word
of
his
intentions
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
am
listening
with
the
greatest
impatience
,
''
replied
the
young
*NL*
man
;
``
speak
,
I
beg
of
you
.
''
Valentine
cast
down
her
eyes
;
this
was
a
*NL*
good
omen
for
Morrel
,
for
he
knew
that
nothing
but
happiness
could
have
*NL*
the
power
of
thus
overcoming
Valentine
.
``
My
grandfather
intends
leaving
*NL*
this
house
,
''
said
she
,
``
and
Barrois
is
looking
out
suitable
apartments
*NL*
for
him
in
another
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
,
Mademoiselle
de
Villefort
,
--
you
,
who
are
necessary
to
M.
*NL*
Noirtier
's
happiness
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
?
''
interrupted
Valentine
;
``
I
shall
not
leave
my
grandfather
,
--
that
is
*NL*
an
understood
thing
between
us
.
My
apartment
will
be
close
to
his
.
*NL*
Now
,
M.
de
Villefort
must
either
give
his
consent
to
this
plan
or
his
*NL*
refusal
;
in
the
first
case
,
I
shall
leave
directly
,
and
in
the
second
,
*NL*
I
shall
wait
till
I
am
of
age
,
which
will
be
in
about
ten
months
.
Then
I
*NL*
shall
be
free
,
I
shall
have
an
independent
fortune
,
and
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
?
''
demanded
Morrel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
with
my
grandfather
's
consent
I
shall
fulfil
the
promise
which
I
*NL*
have
made
you
.
''
Valentine
pronounced
these
last
few
words
in
such
a
low
*NL*
tone
,
that
nothing
but
Morrel
's
intense
interest
in
what
she
was
saying
*NL*
could
have
enabled
him
to
hear
them
.
``
Have
I
not
explained
your
wishes
,
*NL*
grandpapa
?
''
said
Valentine
,
addressing
Noirtier
.
``
Yes
,
''
looked
the
old
*NL*
man
.
--
``
Once
under
my
grandfather
's
roof
,
M.
Morrel
can
visit
me
in
the
*NL*
presence
of
my
good
and
worthy
protector
,
if
we
still
feel
that
the
*NL*
union
we
contemplated
will
be
likely
to
insure
our
future
comfort
and
*NL*
happiness
;
in
that
case
I
shall
expect
M.
Morrel
to
come
and
claim
me
*NL*
at
my
own
hands
.
But
,
alas
,
I
have
heard
it
said
that
hearts
inflamed
*NL*
by
obstacles
to
their
desire
grew
cold
in
time
of
security
;
I
trust
we
*NL*
shall
never
find
it
so
in
our
experience
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
cried
Morrel
,
almost
tempted
to
throw
himself
on
his
knees
before
*NL*
Noirtier
and
Valentine
,
and
to
adore
them
as
two
superior
beings
,
``
what
*NL*
have
I
ever
done
in
my
life
to
merit
such
unbounded
happiness
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Until
that
time
,
''
continued
the
young
girl
in
a
calm
and
self-possessed
*NL*
tone
of
voice
,
``
we
will
conform
to
circumstances
,
and
be
guided
by
the
*NL*
wishes
of
our
friends
,
so
long
as
those
wishes
do
not
tend
finally
to
*NL*
separate
us
;
in
a
word
,
and
I
repeat
it
,
because
it
expresses
all
I
wish
*NL*
to
convey
,
--
we
will
wait
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
swear
to
make
all
the
sacrifices
which
this
word
imposes
,
sir
,
''
*NL*
said
Morrel
,
``
not
only
with
resignation
,
but
with
cheerfulness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Therefore
,
''
continued
Valentine
,
looking
playfully
at
Maximilian
,
``
no
*NL*
more
inconsiderate
actions
--
no
more
rash
projects
;
for
you
surely
*NL*
would
not
wish
to
compromise
one
who
from
this
day
regards
herself
as
*NL*
destined
,
honorably
and
happily
,
to
bear
your
name
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Morrel
looked
obedience
to
her
commands
.
Noirtier
regarded
the
lovers
*NL*
with
a
look
of
ineffable
tenderness
,
while
Barrois
,
who
had
remained
in
*NL*
the
room
in
the
character
of
a
man
privileged
to
know
everything
that
*NL*
passed
,
smiled
on
the
youthful
couple
as
he
wiped
the
perspiration
from
*NL*
his
bald
forehead
.
``
How
hot
you
look
,
my
good
Barrois
,
''
said
Valentine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
I
have
been
running
very
fast
,
mademoiselle
,
but
I
must
do
M.
*NL*
Morrel
the
justice
to
say
that
he
ran
still
faster
.
''
Noirtier
directed
*NL*
their
attention
to
a
waiter
,
on
which
was
placed
a
decanter
containing
*NL*
lemonade
and
a
glass
.
The
decanter
was
nearly
full
,
with
the
exception
*NL*
of
a
little
,
which
had
been
already
drunk
by
M.
Noirtier
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
Barrois
,
''
said
the
young
girl
,
``
take
some
of
this
lemonade
;
I
see
*NL*
you
are
coveting
a
good
draught
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
fact
is
,
mademoiselle
,
''
said
Barrois
,
``
I
am
dying
with
thirst
,
and
*NL*
since
you
are
so
kind
as
to
offer
it
me
,
I
can
not
say
I
should
at
all
*NL*
object
to
drinking
your
health
in
a
glass
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
some
,
then
,
and
come
back
immediately
.
''
Barrois
took
away
the
*NL*
waiter
,
and
hardly
was
he
outside
the
door
,
which
in
his
haste
he
forgot
*NL*
to
shut
,
than
they
saw
him
throw
back
his
head
and
empty
to
the
very
*NL*
dregs
the
glass
which
Valentine
had
filled
.
Valentine
and
Morrel
were
*NL*
exchanging
their
adieux
in
the
presence
of
Noirtier
when
a
ring
was
*NL*
heard
at
the
door-bell
.
It
was
the
signal
of
a
visit
.
Valentine
looked
*NL*
at
her
watch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
past
noon
,
''
said
she
,
``
and
to-day
is
Saturday
;
I
dare
say
it
*NL*
is
the
doctor
,
grandpapa
.
''
Noirtier
looked
his
conviction
that
she
*NL*
was
right
in
her
supposition
.
``
He
will
come
in
here
,
and
M.
Morrel
had
*NL*
better
go
,
--
do
you
not
think
so
,
grandpapa
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
signed
the
old
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Barrois
,
''
cried
Valentine
,
``
Barrois
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
coming
,
mademoiselle
,
''
replied
he
.
``
Barrois
will
open
the
door
for
*NL*
you
,
''
said
Valentine
,
addressing
Morrel
.
``
And
now
remember
one
thing
,
*NL*
Monsieur
Officer
,
that
my
grandfather
commands
you
not
to
take
any
rash
*NL*
or
ill-advised
step
which
would
be
likely
to
compromise
our
happiness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
promised
him
to
wait
,
''
replied
Morrel
;
``
and
I
will
wait
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
moment
Barrois
entered
.
``
Who
rang
?
''
asked
Valentine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Doctor
d'Avrigny
,
''
said
Barrois
,
staggering
as
if
he
would
fall
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
matter
,
Barrois
?
''
said
Valentine
.
The
old
man
did
not
*NL*
answer
,
but
looked
at
his
master
with
wild
staring
eyes
,
while
with
*NL*
his
cramped
hand
he
grasped
a
piece
of
furniture
to
enable
him
to
stand
*NL*
upright
.
``
He
is
going
to
fall
!
''
cried
Morrel
.
The
rigors
which
had
*NL*
attacked
Barrois
gradually
increased
,
the
features
of
the
face
became
*NL*
quite
altered
,
and
the
convulsive
movement
of
the
muscles
appeared
to
*NL*
indicate
the
approach
of
a
most
serious
nervous
disorder
.
Noirtier
,
*NL*
seeing
Barrois
in
this
pitiable
condition
,
showed
by
his
looks
all
the
*NL*
various
emotions
of
sorrow
and
sympathy
which
can
animate
the
heart
of
*NL*
man
.
Barrois
made
some
steps
towards
his
master
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
sir
,
''
said
he
,
``
tell
me
what
is
the
matter
with
me
.
I
am
*NL*
suffering
--
I
can
not
see
.
A
thousand
fiery
darts
are
piercing
my
brain
.
*NL*
Ah
,
do
n't
touch
me
,
pray
do
n't
.
''
By
this
time
his
haggard
eyes
had
the
*NL*
appearance
of
being
ready
to
start
from
their
sockets
;
his
head
fell
*NL*
back
,
and
the
lower
extremities
of
the
body
began
to
stiffen
.
Valentine
*NL*
uttered
a
cry
of
horror
;
Morrel
took
her
in
his
arms
,
as
if
to
defend
*NL*
her
from
some
unknown
danger
.
``
M.
d'Avrigny
,
M.
d'Avrigny
,
''
cried
she
,
*NL*
in
a
stifled
voice
.
``
Help
,
help
!
''
Barrois
turned
round
and
with
a
great
*NL*
effort
stumbled
a
few
steps
,
then
fell
at
the
feet
of
Noirtier
,
and
*NL*
resting
his
hand
on
the
knee
of
the
invalid
,
exclaimed
,
``
My
master
,
my
*NL*
good
master
!
''
At
this
moment
M.
de
Villefort
,
attracted
by
the
noise
,
*NL*
appeared
on
the
threshold
.
Morrel
relaxed
his
hold
of
Valentine
,
and
*NL*
retreating
to
a
distant
corner
of
the
room
remained
half
hidden
behind
*NL*
a
curtain
.
Pale
as
if
he
had
been
gazing
on
a
serpent
,
he
fixed
his
*NL*
terrified
eye
on
the
agonized
sufferer
.
*NL*
*NL*
Noirtier
,
burning
with
impatience
and
terror
,
was
in
despair
at
his
*NL*
utter
inability
to
help
his
old
domestic
,
whom
he
regarded
more
in
the
*NL*
light
of
a
friend
than
a
servant
.
One
might
by
the
fearful
swelling
of
*NL*
the
veins
of
his
forehead
and
the
contraction
of
the
muscles
round
the
*NL*
eye
,
trace
the
terrible
conflict
which
was
going
on
between
the
living
*NL*
energetic
mind
and
the
inanimate
and
helpless
body
.
Barrois
,
his
*NL*
features
convulsed
,
his
eyes
suffused
with
blood
,
and
his
head
thrown
*NL*
back
,
was
lying
at
full
length
,
beating
the
floor
with
his
hands
,
while
*NL*
his
legs
had
become
so
stiff
,
that
they
looked
as
if
they
would
break
*NL*
rather
than
bend
.
A
slight
appearance
of
foam
was
visible
around
the
*NL*
mouth
,
and
he
breathed
painfully
,
and
with
extreme
difficulty
.
*NL*
*NL*
Villefort
seemed
stupefied
with
astonishment
,
and
remained
gazing
*NL*
intently
on
the
scene
before
him
without
uttering
a
word
.
He
had
not
*NL*
seen
Morrel
.
After
a
moment
of
dumb
contemplation
,
during
which
his
face
*NL*
became
pale
and
his
hair
seemed
to
stand
on
end
,
he
sprang
towards
the
*NL*
door
,
crying
out
,
``
Doctor
,
doctor
!
come
instantly
,
pray
come
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madame
,
madame
!
''
cried
Valentine
,
calling
her
step-mother
,
and
running
*NL*
up-stairs
to
meet
her
;
``
come
quick
,
quick
!
--
and
bring
your
bottle
of
*NL*
smelling-salts
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
matter
?
''
said
Madame
de
Villefort
in
a
harsh
and
*NL*
constrained
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
come
,
come
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
where
is
the
doctor
?
''
exclaimed
Villefort
;
``
where
is
he
?
''
Madame
de
*NL*
Villefort
now
deliberately
descended
the
staircase
.
In
one
hand
she
held
*NL*
her
handkerchief
,
with
which
she
appeared
to
be
wiping
her
face
,
and
in
*NL*
the
other
a
bottle
of
English
smelling-salts
.
Her
first
look
on
entering
*NL*
the
room
was
at
Noirtier
,
whose
face
,
independent
of
the
emotion
which
*NL*
such
a
scene
could
not
fail
of
producing
,
proclaimed
him
to
be
in
*NL*
possession
of
his
usual
health
;
her
second
glance
was
at
the
dying
man
.
*NL*
She
turned
pale
,
and
her
eye
passed
quickly
from
the
servant
and
rested
*NL*
on
the
master
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
name
of
heaven
,
madame
,
''
said
Villefort
,
``
where
is
the
doctor
?
*NL*
He
was
with
you
just
now
.
You
see
this
is
a
fit
of
apoplexy
,
and
he
*NL*
might
be
saved
if
he
could
but
be
bled
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
he
eaten
anything
lately
?
''
asked
Madame
de
Villefort
,
eluding
*NL*
her
husband
's
question
.
``
Madame
,
''
replied
Valentine
,
``
he
has
not
even
*NL*
breakfasted
.
He
has
been
running
very
fast
on
an
errand
with
which
my
*NL*
grandfather
charged
him
,
and
when
he
returned
,
took
nothing
but
a
glass
*NL*
of
lemonade
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
said
Madame
de
Villefort
,
``
why
did
he
not
take
wine
?
Lemonade
was
*NL*
a
very
bad
thing
for
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Grandpapa
's
bottle
of
lemonade
was
standing
just
by
his
side
;
poor
*NL*
Barrois
was
very
thirsty
,
and
was
thankful
to
drink
anything
he
could
*NL*
find
.
''
Madame
de
Villefort
started
.
Noirtier
looked
at
her
with
a
glance
*NL*
of
the
most
profound
scrutiny
.
``
He
has
such
a
short
neck
,
''
said
she
.
*NL*
``
Madame
,
''
said
Villefort
,
``
I
ask
where
is
M.
d'Avrigny
?
In
God
's
name
*NL*
answer
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
with
Edward
,
who
is
not
quite
well
,
''
replied
Madame
de
Villefort
,
*NL*
no
longer
being
able
to
avoid
answering
.
*NL*
*NL*
Villefort
rushed
up-stairs
to
fetch
him
.
``
Take
this
,
''
said
Madame
de
*NL*
Villefort
,
giving
her
smelling-bottle
to
Valentine
.
``
They
will
,
no
*NL*
doubt
,
bleed
him
;
therefore
I
will
retire
,
for
I
can
not
endure
the
sight
*NL*
of
blood
;
''
and
she
followed
her
husband
up-stairs
.
Morrel
now
emerged
*NL*
from
his
hiding-place
,
where
he
had
remained
quite
unperceived
,
so
*NL*
great
had
been
the
general
confusion
.
``
Go
away
as
quick
as
you
can
,
*NL*
Maximilian
,
''
said
Valentine
,
``
and
stay
till
I
send
for
you
.
Go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Morrel
looked
towards
Noirtier
for
permission
to
retire
.
The
old
man
,
*NL*
who
had
preserved
all
his
usual
coolness
,
made
a
sign
to
him
to
do
so
.
*NL*
The
young
man
pressed
Valentine
's
hand
to
his
lips
,
and
then
left
the
*NL*
house
by
a
back
staircase
.
At
the
same
moment
that
he
quitted
the
room
,
*NL*
Villefort
and
the
doctor
entered
by
an
opposite
door
.
Barrois
was
now
*NL*
showing
signs
of
returning
consciousness
.
The
crisis
seemed
past
,
a
*NL*
low
moaning
was
heard
,
and
he
raised
himself
on
one
knee
.
D'Avrigny
and
*NL*
Villefort
laid
him
on
a
couch
.
``
What
do
you
prescribe
,
doctor
?
''
demanded
*NL*
Villefort
.
``
Give
me
some
water
and
ether
.
You
have
some
in
the
house
,
*NL*
have
you
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Send
for
some
oil
of
turpentine
and
tartar
emetic
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Villefort
immediately
despatched
a
messenger
.
``
And
now
let
every
one
*NL*
retire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Must
I
go
too
?
''
asked
Valentine
timidly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
mademoiselle
,
you
especially
,
''
replied
the
doctor
abruptly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Valentine
looked
at
M.
d'Avrigny
with
astonishment
,
kissed
her
*NL*
grandfather
on
the
forehead
,
and
left
the
room
.
The
doctor
closed
the
*NL*
door
after
her
with
a
gloomy
air
.
``
Look
,
look
,
doctor
,
''
said
Villefort
,
*NL*
``
he
is
quite
coming
round
again
;
I
really
do
not
think
,
after
all
,
it
is
*NL*
anything
of
consequence
.
''
M.
d'Avrigny
answered
by
a
melancholy
smile
.
*NL*
``
How
do
you
feel
,
Barrois
?
''
asked
he
.
``
A
little
better
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
drink
some
of
this
ether
and
water
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
try
;
but
do
n't
touch
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
I
feel
that
if
you
were
only
to
touch
me
with
the
tip
of
your
*NL*
finger
the
fit
would
return
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Drink
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Barrois
took
the
glass
,
and
,
raising
it
to
his
purple
lips
,
took
about
*NL*
half
of
the
liquid
offered
him
.
``
Where
do
you
suffer
?
''
asked
the
doctor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Everywhere
.
I
feel
cramps
over
my
whole
body
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
find
any
dazzling
sensation
before
the
eyes
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Any
noise
in
the
ears
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Frightful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
did
you
first
feel
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Suddenly
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
like
a
clap
of
thunder
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
feel
nothing
of
it
yesterday
or
the
day
before
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

*NL*
*NL*
``
None

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
have
you
eaten
to-day
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
eaten
nothing
;
I
only
drank
a
glass
of
my
master
's
*NL*
lemonade
--
that
's
all
;
''
and
Barrois
turned
towards
Noirtier
,
who
,
*NL*
immovably
fixed
in
his
arm-chair
,
was
contemplating
this
terrible
scene
*NL*
without
allowing
a
word
or
a
movement
to
escape
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
is
this
lemonade
?
''
asked
the
doctor
eagerly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Down-stairs
in
the
decanter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whereabouts
downstairs
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
kitchen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
I
go
and
fetch
it
,
doctor
?
''
inquired
Villefort
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
stay
here
and
try
to
make
Barrois
drink
the
rest
of
this
glass
of
*NL*
ether
and
water
.
I
will
go
myself
and
fetch
the
lemonade
.
''
D'Avrigny
*NL*
bounded
towards
the
door
,
flew
down
the
back
staircase
,
and
almost
*NL*
knocked
down
Madame
de
Villefort
,
in
his
haste
,
who
was
herself
going
*NL*
down
to
the
kitchen
.
She
cried
out
,
but
d'Avrigny
paid
no
attention
to
*NL*
her
;
possessed
with
but
one
idea
,
he
cleared
the
last
four
steps
with
*NL*
a
bound
,
and
rushed
into
the
kitchen
,
where
he
saw
the
decanter
about
*NL*
three
parts
empty
still
standing
on
the
waiter
,
where
it
had
been
left
.
*NL*
He
darted
upon
it
as
an
eagle
would
seize
upon
its
prey
.
Panting
with
*NL*
loss
of
breath
,
he
returned
to
the
room
he
had
just
left
.
Madame
de
*NL*
Villefort
was
slowly
ascending
the
steps
which
led
to
her
room
.
``
Is
this
*NL*
the
decanter
you
spoke
of
?
''
asked
d'Avrigny
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
doctor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
this
the
same
lemonade
of
which
you
partook
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
did
it
taste
like
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
had
a
bitter
taste
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
doctor
poured
some
drops
of
the
lemonade
into
the
palm
of
his
hand
,
*NL*
put
his
lips
to
it
,
and
after
having
rinsed
his
mouth
as
a
man
does
when
*NL*
he
is
tasting
wine
,
he
spat
the
liquor
into
the
fireplace
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
no
doubt
the
same
,
''
said
he
.
``
Did
you
drink
some
too
,
M.
*NL*
Noirtier
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
did
you
also
discover
a
bitter
taste
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
doctor
,
''
cried
Barrois
,
``
the
fit
is
coming
on
again
.
Oh
,
do
*NL*
something
for
me
.
''
The
doctor
flew
to
his
patient
.
``
That
emetic
,
*NL*
Villefort
--
see
if
it
is
coming
.
''
Villefort
sprang
into
the
passage
,
*NL*
exclaiming
,
``
The
emetic
!
the
emetic
!
--
is
it
come
yet
?
''
No
one
answered
.
*NL*
The
most
profound
terror
reigned
throughout
the
house
.
``
If
I
had
*NL*
anything
by
means
of
which
I
could
inflate
the
lungs
,
''
said
d'Avrigny
,
*NL*
looking
around
him
,
``
perhaps
I
might
prevent
suffocation
.
But
there
is
*NL*
nothing
which
would
do
--
nothing
!
''
``
Oh
,
sir
,
''
cried
Barrois
,
``
are
you
*NL*
going
to
let
me
die
without
help
?
Oh
,
I
am
dying
!
Oh
,
save
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
pen
,
a
pen
!
''
said
the
doctor
.
There
was
one
lying
on
the
table
;
he
*NL*
endeavored
to
introduce
it
into
the
mouth
of
the
patient
,
who
,
in
the
*NL*
midst
of
his
convulsions
,
was
making
vain
attempts
to
vomit
;
but
the
*NL*
jaws
were
so
clinched
that
the
pen
could
not
pass
them
.
This
second
*NL*
attack
was
much
more
violent
than
the
first
,
and
he
had
slipped
from
the
*NL*
couch
to
the
ground
,
where
he
was
writhing
in
agony
.
The
doctor
left
him
*NL*
in
this
paroxysm
,
knowing
that
he
could
do
nothing
to
alleviate
it
,
and
,
*NL*
going
up
to
Noirtier
,
said
abruptly
,
``
How
do
you
find
yourself
?
--
well
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
any
weight
on
the
chest

does
your
stomach
feel
light
and
*NL*
comfortable

eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
feel
pretty
much
as
you
generally
do
after
you
have
had
the
*NL*
dose
which
I
am
accustomed
to
give
you
every
Sunday
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
Barrois
make
your
lemonade
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
it
you
who
asked
him
to
drink
some
of
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

Was

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

''
A
groan
from
Barrois
,
accompanied
by
a
yawn
which
seemed
to
crack
*NL*
the
very
jawbones
,
attracted
the
attention
of
M.
d'Avrigny
;
he
left
M.
*NL*
Noirtier
,
and
returned
to
the
sick
man
.
``
Barrois
,
''
said
the
doctor
,
``
can
*NL*
you
speak
?
''
Barrois
muttered
a
few
unintelligible
words
.
``
Try
and
make
*NL*
an
effort
to
do
so
,
my
good
man

''
said
d'Avrigny
.
Barrois
reopened
his
*NL*
bloodshot
eyes
.
``
Who
made
the
lemonade
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did

You

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

*NL*
*NL*
``
Mademoiselle

D'Avrigny
struck
his
forehead
with
his
hand
.
*NL*
``
Gracious
heaven

''
exclaimed
he
.
``
Doctor

cried
Barrois
,
who
*NL*
felt
another
fit
coming
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
they
never
bring

asked
the
doctor

*NL*
*NL*

choking

Oh
,
my
heart
!
Ah
,
my
*NL*
head
!
--
Oh
,
what
agony
!

Shall
I
suffer
like
this
long
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no

friend
,
''
replied
the
doctor
,
``
you
will
soon
cease
to
suffer

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
I
understand
you
,
''
said
the
unhappy
man
.
``
My
God
,
have
mercy
upon
*NL*
me
!
''
and
,
uttering
a
fearful
cry
,
Barrois
fell
back
as
if
he
had
been
*NL*
struck
by
lightning
.
D'Avrigny
put
his
hand
to
his
heart
,
and
placed
a
*NL*
glass
before
his
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
said
Villefort
.
``
Go
to
the
kitchen
and
get
me
some
syrup
of
*NL*
violets
.
''
Villefort
went
immediately
.
``
Do
not
be
alarmed
,
M.
Noirtier
,
''
*NL*
said
d'Avrigny
;
``
I
am
going
to
take
my
patient
into
the
next
room
to
*NL*
bleed
him
;
this
sort
of
attack
is
very
frightful
to
witness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
taking
Barrois
under
the
arms
,
he
dragged
him
into
an
adjoining
*NL*
room
;
but
almost
immediately
he
returned
to
fetch
the
lemonade
.
Noirtier
*NL*
closed
his
right
eye
.
``
You
want
Valentine
,
do
you
not
?
I
will
tell
them
*NL*
to
send
her
to
you

Villefort
returned
,
and
d'Avrigny
met
him
in
*NL*
the
passage
.
``
Well
,
how
is
he
now
?
''
asked
he
.
``
Come
in
here
,
''
said
*NL*
d'Avrigny
,
and
he
took
him
into
the
chamber
where
the
sick
man
lay
.
``
Is
*NL*
he
still
in
a
fit
?

said
the
procureur
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
dead

*NL*
*NL*
Villefort
drew
back
a
few
steps
,
and
,
clasping
his
hands
,
exclaimed
,
*NL*
with
real
amazement
and
sympathy
,
``
Dead
?
--
and
so
soon
too
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
is
very
soon
,
''
said
the
doctor
,
looking
at
the
corpse
before
*NL*
him
;
``
but
that
ought
not
to
astonish
you
;
Monsieur
and
Madame
de
*NL*
Saint-Meran
died
as
soon

People
die
very
suddenly
in
your
house
,
M.
de
*NL*
Villefort
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
cried
the
magistrate
,
with
an
accent
of
horror
and
*NL*
consternation
,
``
are
you
still
harping
on
that
terrible
idea
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Still
,
sir
;
and
I
shall
always
do
so
,
''
replied
d'Avrigny
,
``
for
it
has
*NL*
never
for
one
instant
ceased
to
retain
possession
of
my
mind
;
and
that
*NL*
you
may
be
quite
sure
I
am
not
mistaken
this
time
,
listen
well
to
what
I
*NL*
am
going
to
say
,
M.
de
Villefort
.
''
The
magistrate
trembled
convulsively
.
*NL*
``
There
is
a
poison
which
destroys
life
almost
without
leaving
any
*NL*
perceptible
traces
.
I
know
it
well
;
I
have
studied
it
in
all
its
forms
*NL*
and
in
the
effects
which
it
produces
.
I
recognized
the
presence
of
*NL*
this
poison
in
the
case
of
poor
Barrois
as
well
as
in
that
of
Madame
de
*NL*
Saint-Meran
.
There
is
a
way
of
detecting
its
presence
.
It
restores
the
*NL*
blue
color
of
litmus-paper
reddened
by
an
acid
,
and
it
turns
syrup
of
*NL*
violets
green
.
We
have
no
litmus-paper
,
but
,
see
,
here
they
come
with
*NL*
the
syrup
of
violets
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
doctor
was
right
;
steps
were
heard
in
the
passage
.
M.
d'Avrigny
*NL*
opened
the
door
,
and
took
from
the
hands
of
the
chambermaid
a
cup
which
*NL*
contained
two
or
three
spoonfuls
of
the
syrup
,
he
then
carefully
closed
*NL*
the
door
.
``
Look
,
''
said
he
to
the
procureur
,
whose
heart
beat
so
loudly
*NL*
that
it
might
almost
be
heard
,
``
here
is
in
this
cup
some
syrup
of
*NL*
violets
,
and
this
decanter
contains
the
remainder
of
the
lemonade
of
*NL*
which
M.
Noirtier
and
Barrois
partook
.
If
the
lemonade
be
pure
and
*NL*
inoffensive
,
the
syrup
will
retain
its
color
;
if
,
on
the
contrary
,
*NL*
the
lemonade
be
drugged
with
poison
,
the
syrup
will
become
green
.
Look
*NL*
closely
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
doctor
then
slowly
poured
some
drops
of
the
lemonade
from
the
*NL*
decanter
into
the
cup
,
and
in
an
instant
a
light
cloudy
sediment
began
*NL*
to
form
at
the
bottom
of
the
cup
;
this
sediment
first
took
a
blue
shade
,
*NL*
then
from
the
color
of
sapphire
it
passed
to
that
of
opal
,
and
from
opal
*NL*
to
emerald
.
Arrived
at
this
last
hue
,
it
changed
no
more
.
The
result
of
*NL*
the
experiment
left
no
doubt
whatever
on
the
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
unfortunate
Barrois
has
been
poisoned
,
''
said
d'Avrigny
,
``
and
I
will
*NL*
maintain
this
assertion
before
God
and
man
.
''
Villefort
said
nothing
,
but
*NL*
he
clasped
his
hands
,
opened
his
haggard
eyes
,
and
,
overcome
with
his
*NL*
emotion
,
sank
into
a
chair

M.

soon
restored
the
magistrate
to
consciousness
,
who
had
*NL*
looked
like
a

in

of

.
``

with

Villefort
cast
a

gloomy
look
around
him

he
,

Villefort
shrieked

*NL*
two
crimes

I
would
say
,

Here
,
M.
de
Villefort
,
is
a
poison
that
the
*NL*
prisoner
is
not
acquainted
with
,
--
one
that
has
no
known
antidote
,
quick
*NL*
as
thought
,
rapid
as
lightning
,
mortal
as
the
thunderbolt
;
give
her
that
*NL*
poison
,
recommending
her
soul
to
God
,
and
save
your
honor
and
your
life
,
*NL*
for
it
is
yours
she
aims
at
;
and
I
can
picture
her
approaching
your
*NL*
pillow
with
her
hypocritical
smiles
and
her
sweet
exhortations
.
Woe
to
*NL*
you
,
M.
de
Villefort
,
if
you
do
not
strike
first
!
'
This
is
what
I
would
*NL*
say
had
she
only
killed
two
persons
but
she
has
seen
three
deaths
,
--
has
*NL*
contemplated
three
murdered
persons
,
--
has
knelt
by
three
corpses
!
To
the
*NL*
scaffold
with
the
poisoner
--
to
the
scaffold
!
Do
you
talk
of
your
honor
?
*NL*
Do
what
I
tell
you
,
and
immortality
awaits
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Villefort
fell
on
his
knees
.
``
Listen
,
''
said
he
;
``
I
have
not
the

*NL*
of

rather
that
which

The

turned
pale

*NL*
*NL*
Villefort

pressed
the

he
;

said
the

after
a
moment

silence

Villefort
looked
at

One

one

You
go

in
all
the
*NL*
horror

my

after
increasing
it
by
what
you

revealed
*NL*
to
me

But
what
will
be
reported
of
the
sudden
death
of
the
poor
old
*NL*
servant

*NL*
*NL*
``
True

M.
d'Avrigny
;
``
we
will
return

The
doctor
went
out
first
,
*NL*
followed
by
M.
de
Villefort
.
The
terrified
servants
were
on
the
stairs
*NL*
and
in
the
passage
where
the
doctor
would
pass
.
``
Sir
,
''
said
d'Avrigny
*NL*
to
Villefort
,
so
loud
that
all
might
hear
,
``
poor
Barrois
has
led
too
*NL*
sedentary
a
life
of
late
;
accustomed
formerly
to
ride
on
horseback
,
*NL*
or
in
the
carriage
,
to
the
four
corners
of
Europe
,
the
monotonous
walk
*NL*
around
that
arm-chair
has
killed
him
--
his
blood
has
thickened
.
He
was
*NL*
stout
,
had
a
short
,
thick
neck
;
he
was
attacked
with
apoplexy
,
and
I
was
*NL*
called
in
too
late
.
By
the
way
,
''
added
he
in
a
low
tone
,
``
take
care
to
*NL*
throw
away
that
cup
of
syrup
of
violets
in
the
ashes

*NL*
*NL*
The
doctor
,
without
shaking
hands
with
Villefort
,
without
adding
a
word
*NL*
to
what
he
had
said
,
went
out
,
amid
the
tears
and
lamentations
of
the
*NL*
whole
household
.
The
same
evening
all
Villefort
's
servants
,
who
had
*NL*
assembled
in
the
kitchen
,
and
had
a
long
consultation
,
came
to
*NL*
tell
Madame
de
Villefort
that
they
wished
to
leave
.
No
entreaty
,
no
*NL*
proposition
of
increased
wages
,
could
induce
them
to
remain
;
to
every
*NL*
argument
they
replied
,
``
We
must
go
,
for
death
is
in
this
house
.
''
They
*NL*
all
left
,
in
spite
of
prayers
and
entreaties
,
testifying
their
regret
*NL*
at
leaving
so
good
a
master
and
mistress
,
and
especially
Mademoiselle
*NL*
Valentine
,
so
good
,
so
kind
,
and
so
gentle
.
Villefort
looked
at
*NL*
Valentine
as
they
said
this
.
She
was
in
tears
,
and
,
strange
as
it
was
,
*NL*
in
spite
of
the
emotions
he
felt
at
the
sight
of
these
tears
,
he
looked
*NL*
also
at
Madame
de
Villefort
,
and
it
appeared
to
him
as
if
a
slight
*NL*
gloomy
smile
had
passed
over
her
thin
lips
,
like
a
meteor
seen
passing
*NL*
inauspiciously
between
two
clouds
in
a
stormy
sky

Chapter

The
Room
of
the
Retired
Baker
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
evening
of
the
day
on
which
the
Count
of
Morcerf
had
left
Danglars
'
*NL*
house
with
feelings
of
shame
and
anger
at
the
rejection
of
the
projected
*NL*
alliance
,
M.
Andrea
Cavalcanti
,
with
curled
hair
,
mustaches
in
perfect
*NL*
order
,
and
white
gloves
which
fitted
admirably
,
had
entered
the
*NL*
courtyard
of
the
banker
's
house
in
La
Chaussee
d'Antin
.
He
had
not
been
*NL*
more
than
ten
minutes
in
the
drawing-room
before
he
drew
Danglars
aside
*NL*
into
the
recess
of
a
bow-window
,
and
,
after
an
ingenious
preamble
,
*NL*
related
to
him
all
his
anxieties
and
cares
since
his
noble
father
's
*NL*
departure
.
He
acknowledged
the
extreme
kindness
which
had
been
shown
*NL*
him
by
the
banker
's
family
,
in
which
he
had
been
received
as
a
son
,
and
*NL*
where
,
besides
,
his
warmest
affections
had
found
an
object
on
which
*NL*
to
centre
in
Mademoiselle
Danglars
.
Danglars
listened
with
the
most
*NL*
profound
attention
;
he
had
expected
this
declaration
for
the
last
two
or
*NL*
three
days
,
and
when
at
last
it
came
his
eyes
glistened
as
much
as
*NL*
they
had
lowered
on
listening
to
Morcerf
.
He
would
not
,
however
,
yield
*NL*
immediately
to
the
young
man
's
request
,
but
made
a
few
conscientious
*NL*
objections
.
``
Are
you
not
rather
young
,
M.
Andrea
,
to
think
of
marrying
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
not
,
sir
,
''
replied
M.
Cavalcanti
;
``
in
Italy
the
nobility
*NL*
generally
marry
young
.
Life
is
so
uncertain
,
that
we
ought
to
secure
*NL*
happiness
while
it
is
within
our
reach
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
sir
,
''
said
Danglars
,
``
in
case
your
proposals
,
which
do
me
honor
,
*NL*
are
accepted
by
my
wife
and
daughter
,
by
whom
shall
the
preliminary
*NL*
arrangements
be
settled
?
So
important
a
negotiation
should
,
I
think
,
be
*NL*
conducted
by
the
respective
fathers
of
the
young
people
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
,
my
father
is
a
man
of
great
foresight
and
prudence
.
Thinking
that
*NL*
I
might
wish
to
settle
in
France
,
he
left
me
at
his
departure
,
together
*NL*
with
the
papers
establishing
my
identity
,
a
letter
promising
,
if
he
*NL*
approved
of
my
choice
,
150,000
livres
per
annum
from
the
day
I
was
*NL*
married
.
So
far
as
I
can
judge
,
I
suppose
this
to
be
a
quarter
of
my
*NL*
father
's
revenue
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
,
''
said
Danglars
,
``
have
always
intended
giving
my
daughter
500,000
*NL*
francs
as
her
dowry
;
she
is
,
besides
,
my
sole
heiress
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
would
then
be
easily
arranged
if
the
baroness
and
her
daughter
*NL*
are
willing
.
We
should
command
an
annuity
of
175,000
livres
.
Supposing
,
*NL*
also
,
I
should
persuade
the
marquis
to
give
me
my
capital
,
which
is
*NL*
not
likely
,
but
still
is
possible
,
we
would
place
these
two
or
three
*NL*
millions
in
your
hands
,
whose
talent
might
make
it
realize
ten
per
*NL*
cent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
give
more
than
four
per
cent
,
and
generally
only
three
and
a
*NL*
half
;
but
to
my
son-in-law
I
would
give
five
,
and
we
would
share
the
*NL*
profit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
good
,
father-in-law
,
''
said
Cavalcanti
,
yielding
to
his
low-born
*NL*
nature
,
which
would
escape
sometimes
through
the
aristocratic
gloss
with
*NL*
which
he
sought
to
conceal
it
.
Correcting
himself
immediately
,
he
said
,
*NL*
``
Excuse
me
,
sir
;
hope
alone
makes
me
almost
mad
,
--
what
will
not
reality
*NL*
do

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
''
said
Danglars
,
--
who
,
on
his
part
,
did
not
perceive
how
soon
*NL*
the
conversation
,
which
was
at
first
disinterested
,
was
turning
to
a
*NL*
business
transaction
,
--
``
there
is
,
doubtless
,
a
part
of
your
fortune
your
*NL*
father
could
not
refuse
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Which
?
''
asked
the
young
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
you
inherit
from
your
mother

*NL*
*NL*
``
Truly
,
from
my
mother
,
Leonora
Corsinari
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
much
may
it
amount
to
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
sir
,
''
said
Andrea
,
``
I
assure
you
I
have
never
given
the
subject
*NL*
a
thought
,
but
I
suppose
it
must
have
been
at
least
two
millions
.
''
*NL*
Danglars
felt
as
much
overcome
with
joy
as
the
miser
who
finds
a
lost
*NL*
treasure
,
or
as
the
shipwrecked
mariner
who
feels
himself
on
solid
*NL*
ground
instead
of
in
the
abyss
which
he
expected
would
swallow
him
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
sir
,
''
said
Andrea
,
bowing
to
the
banker
respectfully
,
``
may
I
*NL*
hope
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
not
only
hope
,
''
said
Danglars
,
``
but
consider
it
a
settled
*NL*
thing

if
no
obstacle
arises
on
your
part

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
,
indeed
,
rejoiced
,

said
Andrea
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
''
said
Danglars
thoughtfully
,
``
how
is
it
that
your
patron
,
M.
*NL*
de
Monte
Cristo
,
did
not
make
his
proposal
for
you
?
''
Andrea
blushed
*NL*
imperceptibly
.
``
I
have
just
left
the
count
,
sir
,
''
said
he
;
``
he
is
,
*NL*
doubtless
,
a
delightful
man
but
inconceivably
peculiar
in
his
ideas
.
He
*NL*
esteems
me
highly
.
He
even
told
me
he
had
not
the
slightest
doubt
*NL*
that
my
father
would
give
me
the
capital
instead
of
the
interest
of
my
*NL*
property
.
He
has
promised
to
use
his
influence
to
obtain
it
for
me
;
but
*NL*
he
also
declared
that
he
never
had
taken
on
himself
the
responsibility
*NL*
of
making
proposals
for
another
,
and
he
never
would
.
I
must
,
however
,
do
*NL*
him
the
justice
to
add
that
he
assured
me
if
ever
he
had
regretted
the
*NL*
repugnance
he
felt
to
such
a
step
it
was
on
this
occasion
,
because
he
*NL*
thought
the
projected
union
would
be
a
happy
and
suitable
one
.
Besides
,
*NL*
if
he
will
do
nothing
officially
,
he
will
answer
any
questions
you
*NL*
propose
to
him

And
now

continued
he
,
with
one
of
his
most
charming
*NL*
smiles
,
``
having
finished
talking
to
the
father-in-law
,
I
must
address
*NL*
myself
to
the
banker

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
may
you
have
to
say

Danglars

laughing
in
his
*NL*
turn

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
the
day
after
to-morrow
I
shall
have
to
draw
upon
you
for
about

four

the
count
,
expecting
my
bachelor

revenue
*NL*
could
not
suffice
for
the
coming
month

has
offered
me
a
draft

for
twenty
thousand

bears

``
Bring

for
eighty
*NL*
thousand
francs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
ten
o'clock
then
,
if
you
please
;
I
should
like
it
early
,
as
I
am
*NL*
going
into
the
country
to-morrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
at
ten
o'clock

you
are
still
at
the
Hotel
des
Princes
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
following
morning
,
with
the
banker
's
usual
punctuality
,
the
eighty
*NL*
thousand
francs
were
placed
in
the
young
man
's
hands
as
he
was
on
the
*NL*
point
of
starting
,
after
having
left
two
hundred
francs
for
Caderousse
.
*NL*
He
went
out
chiefly
to
avoid
this
dangerous
enemy
,
and
returned
as
*NL*
late
as
possible
in
the
evening
.
But
scarcely
had
he
stepped
out
of
his
*NL*
carriage
when
the
porter
met
him
with
a
parcel
in
his
hand
.
``
Sir
,
''
said
*NL*
he
,
``
that
man
has
been
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
man
?
''
said
Andrea
carelessly
,
apparently
forgetting
him
whom
he
*NL*
but
too
well
recollected
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Him
to
whom
your
excellency
pays
that
little
annuity
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
said
Andrea
,
``
my
father
's
old
servant
.
Well
,
you
gave
him
the
two
*NL*
hundred
francs
I
had
left
for
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
your
excellency
.
''
Andrea
had
expressed
a
wish
to
be
thus
*NL*
addressed
.
``
But
,
''
continued
the
porter
,
``
he
would
not
take
them
.
''
Andrea
*NL*
turned
pale
,
but
as
it
was
dark
his
pallor
was
not
perceptible
.
``
What
?
*NL*
he
would
not
take
them
?
''
said
he
with
slight
emotion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
he
wished
to
speak
to
your
excellency
;
I
told
him
you
were
gone
*NL*
out
,
and
after
some
dispute
he
believed
me
and
gave
me
this
letter
,
*NL*
which
he
had
brought
with
him
already
sealed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
it
me
,
''
said
Andrea
,
and
he
read
by
the
light
of
his
*NL*
carriage-lamp
,
--
``
You
know
where
I
live
;
I
expect
you
tomorrow
morning
at
*NL*
nine
o'clock
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Andrea
examined
it
carefully
,
to
ascertain
if
the
letter
had
been
*NL*
opened
,
or
if
any
indiscreet
eyes
had
seen
its
contents
;
but
it
was
*NL*
so
carefully
folded
,
that
no
one
could
have
read
it
,
and
the
seal
was
*NL*
perfect
.
``
Very
well
,
''
said
he
.
``
Poor
man
,
he
is
a
worthy
creature
.
''
*NL*
He
left
the
porter
to
ponder
on
these
words
,
not
knowing
which
most
to
*NL*
admire
,
the
master
or
the
servant
.
``
Take
out
the
horses
quickly
,
and
*NL*
come
up
to
me
,
''
said
Andrea
to
his
groom
.
In
two
seconds
the
young
man
*NL*
had
reached
his
room
and
burnt
Caderousse
's
letter
.
The
servant
entered
*NL*
just
as
he
had
finished
.
``
You
are
about
my
height
,
Pierre
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
that
honor
,
your
excellency
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
had
a
new
livery
yesterday
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
an
engagement
with
a
pretty
little
girl
for
this
evening
,
and
do
*NL*
not
wish
to
be
known
;
lend
me
your
livery
till
to-morrow
.
I
may
sleep
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
at
an
inn
.
''
Pierre
obeyed
.
Five
minutes
after
,
Andrea
left
the
*NL*
hotel
,
completely
disguised
,
took
a
cabriolet
,
and
ordered
the
driver
to
*NL*
take
him
to
the
Cheval
Rouge
,
at
Picpus
.
The
next
morning
he
left
that
*NL*
inn
as
he
had
left
the
Hotel
des
Princes
,
without
being
noticed
,
walked
*NL*
down
the
Faubourg
St.
Antoine
,
along
the
boulevard
to
Rue
Menilmontant
,
*NL*
and
stopping
at
the
door
of
the
third
house
on
the
left
looked
for
some
*NL*
one
of
whom
to
make
inquiry
in
the
porter
's
absence
.
``
For
whom
are
you
*NL*
looking
,
my
fine
fellow
?
''
asked
the
fruiteress
on
the
opposite
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
Pailletin
,
if
you
please
,
my
good
woman
,
''
replied
Andrea
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
retired
baker
?
''
asked
the
fruiteress
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Exactly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
lives
at
the
end
of
the
yard
,
on
the
left
,
on
the
third
story
.
''
*NL*
Andrea
went
as
she
directed
him
,
and
on
the
third
floor
he
found
a
*NL*
hare
's
paw
,
which
,
by
the
hasty
ringing
of
the
bell
,
it
was
evident
he
*NL*
pulled
with
considerable
ill-temper
.
A
moment
after
Caderousse
's
face
*NL*
appeared
at
the
grating
in
the
door
.
``
Ah
,
you
are
punctual
,
''
said
he
,
as
*NL*
he
drew
back
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Confound
you
and
your
punctuality
!
''
said
Andrea
,
throwing
himself
into
*NL*
a
chair
in
a
manner
which
implied
that
he
would
rather
have
flung
it
at
*NL*
the
head
of
his
host
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
come
,
my
little
fellow
,
do
n't
be
angry
.
See
,
I
have
thought
about
*NL*
you
--
look
at
the
good
breakfast
we
are
going
to
have
;
nothing
but
what
*NL*
you
are
fond
of
.
''
Andrea
,
indeed
,
inhaled
the
scent
of
something
cooking
*NL*
which
was
not
unwelcome
to
him
,
hungry
as
he
was
;
it
was
that
mixture
*NL*
of
fat
and
garlic
peculiar
to
provincial
kitchens
of
an
inferior
order
,
*NL*
added
to
that
of
dried
fish
,
and
above
all
,
the
pungent
smell
of
musk
*NL*
and
cloves
.
These
odors
escaped
from
two
deep
dishes
which
were
covered
*NL*
and
placed
on
a
stove
,
and
from
a
copper
pan
placed
in
an
old
iron
pot
.
*NL*
In
an
adjoining
room
Andrea
saw
also
a
tolerably
clean
table
prepared
*NL*
for
two
,
two
bottles
of
wine
sealed
,
the
one
with
green
,
the
other
with
*NL*
yellow
,
a
supply
of
brandy
in
a
decanter
,
and
a
measure
of
fruit
in
a
*NL*
cabbage-leaf
,
cleverly
arranged
on
an
earthenware
plate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
think
of
it
,
my
little
fellow
?
''
said
Caderousse
.
``
Ay
,
that
*NL*
smells
good
!
You
know
I
used
to
be
a
famous
cook
;
do
you
recollect
how
*NL*
you
used
to
lick
your
fingers
?
You
were
among
the
first
who
tasted
any
*NL*
of
my
dishes
,
and
I
think
you
relished
them
tolerably
.
''
While
speaking
,
*NL*
Caderousse
went
on
peeling
a
fresh
supply
of
onions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
''
said
Andrea
,
ill-temperedly
,
``
by
my
faith
,
if
it
was
only
to
*NL*
breakfast
with
you
,
that
you
disturbed
me
,
I
wish
the
devil
had
taken
*NL*
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
boy
,
''
said
Caderousse
sententiously
,
``
one
can
talk
while
eating
.
And
*NL*
then
,
you
ungrateful
being
,
you
are
not
pleased
to
see
an
old
friend
?
*NL*
I
am
weeping
with
joy
.
''
He
was
truly
crying
,
but
it
would
have
been
*NL*
difficult
to
say
whether
joy
or
the
onions
produced
the
greatest
effect
*NL*
on
the
lachrymal
glands
of
the
old
inn-keeper
of
the
Pont-du-Gard
.
``
Hold
*NL*
your
tongue
,
hypocrite
,
''
said
Andrea
;
``
you
love
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
do
,
or
may
the
devil
take
me
.
I
know
it
is
a
weakness
,
''
said
*NL*
Caderousse
,
``
but
it
overpowers
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
yet
it
has
not
prevented
your
sending
for
me
to
play
me
some
*NL*
trick
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
''
said
Caderousse
,
wiping
his
large
knife
on
his
apron
,
``
if
I
did
*NL*
not
like
you
,
do
you
think
I
should
endure
the
wretched
life
you
*NL*
lead
me
?
Think
for
a
moment
.
You
have
your
servant
's
clothes
on
--
you
*NL*
therefore
keep
a
servant
;
I
have
none
,
and
am
obliged
to
prepare
my
own
*NL*
meals
.
You
abuse
my
cookery
because
you
dine
at
the
table
d'hote
of
*NL*
the
Hotel
des
Princes
,
or
the
Cafe
de
Paris
.
Well
,
I
too
could
keep
a
*NL*
servant
;
I
too
could
have
a
tilbury
;
I
too
could
dine
where
I
like
;
but
*NL*
why
do
I
not
?
Because
I
would
not
annoy
my
little
Benedetto
.
Come
,
just
*NL*
acknowledge
that
I
could
,
eh
?
''
This
address
was
accompanied
by
a
look
*NL*
which
was
by
no
means
difficult
to
understand
.
``
Well
,
''
said
Andrea
,
*NL*
``
admitting
your
love
,
why
do
you
want
me
to
breakfast
with
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
I
may
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you

my
little
fellow

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
use
of
seeing
me
after
we
have
made
all
our
arrangements
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
,
dear
friend
,
''
said
Caderousse
,
``
are
wills
ever
made
without
*NL*
codicils
?
But
you
first
came
to
breakfast
,
did
you
not

Well
,
sit
down
,
*NL*
and
let
us
begin
with
these
pilchards

and
this
fresh
butter
;

I

have
put
on
some
vine-leaves

please
you

wicked
one

Ah

yes

you

look
at
my

my
images

three
francs
each

But

This
is
not
the

*NL*
*NL*
``
Come

you
are
growing
discontented

you
are
no
longer
happy
;
you

who
*NL*
only
wish
to
live
like
a
retired
baker

Caderousse
sighed
.
``
Well
,
what
*NL*
have
you
to
say
?
you
have
seen
your
dream
realized

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
still
say
it
is
a
dream

a

he
has
an
annuity

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

since
I
bring
you
your
two
hundred

Caderousse
shrugged
*NL*
his
shoulders
.
``
It
is
humiliating
,
''
said
he
,
``
thus
to
receive
money
*NL*
given
grudgingly
,

an
uncertain
supply

may
soon
fail

You
see
I
*NL*
am
obliged
to
economize
,
in

prosperity
should
cease

Well
,
my
*NL*
friend

fortune
is
inconstant

as
the
chaplain
of
the
regiment
said
.
I
*NL*
know
your

you
are

*NL*
*NL*
``
What

of
Danglars

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
to
be
sure
;
must
I
say
Baron
Danglars

I
might
as
well
say
Count
*NL*
Benedetto
.
He
was
an
old
friend
of
mine
and
if
he
had
not
so
bad
a
*NL*
memory
he
ought
to
invite

*NL*
Yes

yes

he
was
not
so
proud
then
,

he
was
an
under-clerk
*NL*
to
the
good
M.
Morrel
.
I
have
dined
many
times
with
him
and
the
Count
of
*NL*
Morcerf
,
so
you
see
I
have
some
high
connections
and
were
I
to
cultivate
*NL*
them
a
little
,
we
might
meet
in
the
same
drawing-rooms
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Come

your
jealousy
represents
everything

you

*NL*
``
That

all
very
fine

Benedetto

I
know
what
I

Perhaps
I
may
one
day
put
on
my
best
coat

and
presenting
myself
at

the
great
gate

introduce
myself

Meanwhile
let
us
sit
down
and

eat

''
Caderousse
set
the
example
and
attacked
the
breakfast
with
good
*NL*
appetite
,
praising
each
dish
he
set
before
his
visitor
.
The
latter
*NL*
seemed
to
have
resigned
himself
;
he
drew
the
corks
,
and
partook
largely
*NL*
of
the
fish
with
the
garlic
and
fat
.
``
Ah
,
mate
,
''
said
Caderousse
,
``
you
*NL*
are
getting
on
better
terms
with
your
old
landlord

*NL*
*NL*
``
Faith

yes

replied
Andrea
,
whose
hunger
prevailed
over
every
other
*NL*
feeling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
like
it
,
you
rogue
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
much
that
I
wonder
how
a
man
who
can
cook
thus
can
complain
of
hard
*NL*
living

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
see

said
Caderousse
,
``
all
my
happiness
is
marred
by
one
*NL*
thought

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
that

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
I
am
dependent

another

gained
my

livelihood
honestly

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
not

that
disturb
you

I
have
enough
for
two

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

truly
;
you
may
believe
me
if
you
will

at
the
end

am
tormented
by
remorse

*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
Caderousse
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
So
much
so

that
yesterday
I

two
hundred

Yes

*NL*
*NL*
``
True
remorse
;
and
,
besides

an
idea
had
struck
me

Andrea
shuddered
;
*NL*
he
always
did
so
at
Caderousse
's
ideas
.
``
It
is
miserable

do
you

always
to
wait

``
Oh
,

said
Andrea
*NL*
philosophically

determined
to
watch
his
companion
narrowly
,
``
does
not
*NL*
life
pass
in
waiting

Do
I

fare
better

I
wait

patiently

do
I
not

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

perhaps
even
twelve

Down
there

you
tried

retire

*NL*

biting
off

``

Caderousse

alarmed
Andrea
still

more
than
his

were

the
germ

the
plan
was
reality

``
Let

me
see

laying
out

Andrea

more
than
tremble

turned
pale

Andrea
sketched

formed
an
angle

appeared

looked
at
the
young

as
*NL*
if
to
get
at
the
truth
from
the
bottom
of
his
heart
.
But
Andrea
drew
*NL*
a
cigar-case
from
his
pocket
,
took
a
Havana
,
quietly
lit
it
,
and
began
*NL*
smoking
.
``
When

he
to

Caderousse

*NL*
*NL*

Andrea
took
five

twenty

*NL*
*NL*
``

Caderousse

Caderousse
had
become
so
gloomy
that
Andrea
feared
he
should
be
*NL*
obliged
to
notice
the
change
.
He
redoubled
his
gayety
and
carelessness
.
*NL*
``
How
sprightly
you
are

said
Caderousse
;

``

Andrea

*NL*
*NL*

Andrea

who
,
without
becoming
angry
,
*NL*
as
Caderousse
feared
,
at
this
new
extortion
,
quietly
resigned
the
ring
.
*NL*
Caderousse
looked
so
closely
at
it
that
Andrea
well
knew
that
he
was
*NL*
examining
to
see
if
all
the
edges
were
perfect
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It

Caderousse

replied
Andrea

*NL*
``
Do

Caderousse
went
to
the
window

touched
*NL*
the
glass
with
it
,
and
found
it
would
cut
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Confiteor

said
Caderousse
,
putting
the
diamond
on
his
little
finger
;
*NL*
``
I
was
mistaken

thieves
of
jewellers
imitate
so
well
that
it
*NL*
is
no
longer
worth

to
rob

shop

it
is
another
branch
*NL*
of
industry
paralyzed

*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
finished

Andrea

Caderousse
remained
on

until
he

not

seen

Andrea
go
down
the
three
stories

also
cross
the
court

Then
he

returned
hastily

shut

door
carefully

began
to
study

clever
architect

Andrea
had
left

The
Burglary
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
day
following
that
on
which
the
conversation
we
have
related
took
*NL*
place
,
the
Count
of
Monte
Cristo
set
out
for
Auteuil
,
accompanied
by
*NL*
Ali
and
several
attendants
,
and
also
taking
with
him
some
horses
whose
*NL*
qualities
he
was
desirous
of
ascertaining
.
He
was
induced
to
undertake
*NL*
this
journey
,
of
which
the
day
before
he
had
not
even
thought
and
which
*NL*
had
not
occurred
to
Andrea
either
,
by
the
arrival
of
Bertuccio
from
*NL*
Normandy
with
intelligence
respecting
the
house
and
sloop
.
The
house
was
*NL*
ready
,
and
the
sloop
which
had
arrived
a
week
before
lay
at
anchor
in
a
*NL*
small
creek
with
her
crew
of
six
men
,
who
had
observed
all
the
requisite
*NL*
formalities
and
were
ready
again
to
put
to
sea
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
count
praised
Bertuccio
's
zeal
,
and
ordered
him
to
prepare
for
a
*NL*
speedy
departure
,
as
his
stay
in
France
would
not
be
prolonged
more
than
*NL*
a
month
.
``
Now
,
''
said
he
,
``
I
may
require
to
go
in
one
night
from
Paris
to
*NL*
Treport
;
let
eight
fresh
horses
be
in
readiness
on
the
road
,
which
will
*NL*
enable
me
to
go
fifty
leagues
in
ten
hours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
highness
had
already
expressed
that
wish
,
''
said
Bertuccio
,
``
and
*NL*
the
horses
are
ready
.
I
have
bought
them
,
and
stationed
them
myself
at
*NL*
the
most
desirable
posts
,
that
is
,
in
villages
,
where
no
one
generally
*NL*
stops
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
well

said
Monte
Cristo
;
``
I
remain
here
a
day
or
two

arrange
*NL*
accordingly

As
Bertuccio
was
leaving
the
room
to
give
the
requisite
*NL*
orders
,
Baptistin
opened
the
door
:
he
held
a
letter
on
a
silver
waiter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you

asked
the

,
without
answering
,
approached
the
count
,
and
presented
the
*NL*
letter
.
``
Important
and
urgent
,
''
said
he
.
The
count
opened
the
letter
,
*NL*
and
read
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
M.
de
Monte
Cristo
is
apprised
that
this
night
a
man
will
enter
his
*NL*
house
in
the
Champs-Elysees
with
the
intention
of
carrying
off
some
*NL*
papers
supposed
to
be
in
the
secretary
in
the
dressing-room
.
The
count
's
*NL*
well-known
courage
will
render
unnecessary
the
aid
of
the
police
,
whose
*NL*
interference
might
seriously
affect
him
who
sends
this
advice
.
The
*NL*
count
,
by
any
opening
from
the
bedroom
,
or
by
concealing
himself
in
*NL*
the
dressing-room
,
would
be
able
to
defend
his
property
himself
.
Many
*NL*
attendants
or
apparent
precautions
would
prevent
the
villain
from
*NL*
the
attempt
,
and
M.
de
Monte
Cristo
would
lose
the
opportunity
of
*NL*
discovering
an
enemy
whom
chance
has
revealed
to
him
who
now
sends
this
*NL*
warning
to
the
count
,
--
a
warning
he
might
not
be
able
to
send
another
*NL*
time
,
if
this
first
attempt
should
fail
and
another
be
made
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
count
's
first
idea
was
that
this
was
an
artifice
--
a
gross
deception
,
*NL*
to
draw
his
attention
from
a
minor
danger
in
order
to
expose
him
to
a
*NL*
greater
.
He
was
on
the
point
of
sending
the
letter
to
the
commissary
of
*NL*
police
,
notwithstanding
the
advice
of
his
anonymous
friend
,
or
perhaps
*NL*
because
of
that
advice
,
when
suddenly
the
idea
occurred
to
him
that
it
*NL*
might
be
some
personal
enemy
,
whom
he
alone
should
recognize
and
over
*NL*
whom
,
if
such
were
the
case
,
he
alone
would
gain
any
advantage
,
as
*NL*
Fiesco
-LSB-
*
-RSB-
had
done
over
the
Moor
who
would
have
killed
him
.
We
know
the
*NL*
Count
's
vigorous
and
daring
mind
,
denying
anything
to
be
impossible
,
*NL*
with
that
energy
which
marks
the
great
man
.
From
his
past
life
,
from
*NL*
his
resolution
to
shrink
from
nothing
,
the
count
had
acquired
an
*NL*
inconceivable
relish
for
the
contests
in
which
he
had
engaged
,
sometimes
*NL*
against
nature
,
that
is
to
say
,
against
God
,
and
sometimes
against
the
*NL*
world
,
that
is
,
against
the
devil
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
The
Genoese
conspirator
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
do
not
want
my
papers
,
''
said
Monte
Cristo
,
``
they
want
to
kill
*NL*
me
;
they
are
no
robbers
,
but
assassins
.
I
will
not
allow
the
prefect
of
*NL*
police
to
interfere
with
my
private
affairs
.
I
am
rich
enough
,
forsooth
,
*NL*
to
distribute
his
authority
on
this
occasion
.
''
The
count
recalled
*NL*
Baptistin
,
who
had
left
the
room
after
delivering
the
letter
.
``
Return
to
*NL*
Paris
,
''
said
he
;
``
assemble
the
servants
who
remain
there
.
I
want
all
my
*NL*
household
at
Auteuil
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
will
no
one
remain
in
the
house
,
my
lord
?
''
asked
Baptistin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
the
porter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
lord
will
remember
that
the
lodge
is
at
a
distance
from
the
house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
house
might
be
stripped
without
his
hearing
the
least
noise
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
whom
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
thieves
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
a
fool
,
M.
Baptistin
.
Thieves
might
strip
the
house
--
it
would
*NL*
annoy
me
less
than
to
be
disobeyed
.
''
Baptistin
bowed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
understand
me
?
''
said
the
count
.
``
Bring
your
comrades
here
,
one
and
*NL*
all
;
but
let
everything
remain
as
usual
,
only
close
the
shutters
of
the
*NL*
ground
floor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
those
of
the
second
floor
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
they
are
never
closed
.
Go
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
count
signified
his
intention
of
dining
alone
,
and
that
no
one
but
*NL*
Ali
should
attend
him
.
Having
dined
with
his
usual
tranquillity
and
*NL*
moderation
,
the
count
,
making
a
signal
to
Ali
to
follow
him
,
went
out
*NL*
by
the
side-gate
and
on
reaching
the
Bois
de
Boulogne
turned
,
apparently
*NL*
without
design
towards
Paris
and
at
twilight
;
found
himself
opposite
his
*NL*
house
in
the
Champs-Elysees
.
All
was
dark
;
one
solitary
,
feeble
light
*NL*
was
burning
in
the
porter
's
lodge
,
about
forty
paces
distant
from
the
*NL*
house
,
as
Baptistin
had
said
.
Monte
Cristo
leaned
against
a
tree
,
and
*NL*
with
that
scrutinizing
glance
which
was
so
rarely
deceived
,
looked
up
*NL*
and
down
the
avenue
,
examined
the
passers-by
,
and
carefully
looked
down
*NL*
the
neighboring
streets
,
to
see
that
no
one
was
concealed
.
Ten
minutes
*NL*
passed
thus
,
and
he
was
convinced
that
no
one
was
watching
him
.
He
*NL*
hastened
to
the
side-door
with
Ali
,
entered
hurriedly
,
and
by
the
*NL*
servants
'
staircase
,
of
which
he
had
the
key
,
gained
his
bedroom
without
*NL*
opening
or
disarranging
a
single
curtain
,
without
even
the
porter
*NL*
having
the
slightest
suspicion
that
the
house
,
which
he
supposed
empty
,
*NL*
contained
its
chief
occupant
.
*NL*
*NL*
Arrived
in
his
bedroom
,
the
count
motioned
to
Ali
to
stop
;
then
he
*NL*
passed
into
the
dressing-room
,
which
he
examined
.
Everything
appeared
*NL*
as
usual
--
the
precious
secretary
in
its
place
,
and
the
key
in
the
*NL*
secretary
.
He
double
locked
it
,
took
the
key
,
returned
to
the
bedroom
*NL*
door
,
removed
the
double
staple
of
the
bolt
,
and
went
in
.
Meanwhile
Ali
*NL*
had
procured
the
arms
the
count
required
--
namely
,
a
short
carbine
and
*NL*
a
pair
of
double-barrelled
pistols
,
with
which
as
sure
an
aim
might
be
*NL*
taken
as
with
a
single-barrelled
one
.
Thus
armed
,
the
count
held
the
*NL*
lives
of
five
men
in
his
hands
.
It
was
about
half-past
nine
.
The
count
*NL*
and
Ali
ate
in
haste
a
crust
of
bread
and
drank
a
glass
of
Spanish
wine
;
*NL*
then
Monte
Cristo
slipped
aside
one
of
the
movable
panels
,
which
enabled
*NL*
him
to
see
into
the
adjoining
room
.
He
had
within
his
reach
his
pistols
*NL*
and
carbine
,
and
Ali
,
standing
near
him
,
held
one
of
the
small
Arabian
*NL*
hatchets
,
whose
form
has
not
varied
since
the
Crusades
.
Through
one
of
*NL*
the
windows
of
the
bedroom
,
on
a
line
with
that
in
the
dressing-room
,
*NL*
the
count
could
see
into
the
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
hours
passed
thus
.
It
was
intensely
dark
;
still
Ali
,
thanks
to
his
*NL*
wild
nature
,
and
the
count
,
thanks
doubtless
to
his
long
confinement
,
*NL*
could
distinguish
in
the
darkness
the
slightest
movement
of
the
trees
.
*NL*
The
little
light
in
the
lodge
had
long
been
extinct
.
It
might
be
*NL*
expected
that
the
attack
,
if
indeed
an
attack
was
projected
,
would
be
*NL*
made
from
the
staircase
of
the
ground
floor
,
and
not
from
a
window
;
in
*NL*
Monte
Cristo
's
opinion
,
the
villains
sought
his
life
,
not
his
money
.
It
*NL*
would
be
his
bedroom
they
would
attack
,
and
they
must
reach
it
by
the
*NL*
back
staircase
,
or
by
the
window
in
the
dressing-room
.
The
clock
of
*NL*
the
Invalides
struck
a
quarter
to
twelve
;
the
west
wind
bore
on
its
*NL*
moistened
gusts
the
doleful
vibration
of
the
three
strokes
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
last
stroke
died
away
,
the
count
thought
he
heard
a
slight
noise
*NL*
in
the
dressing-room
;
this
first
sound
,
or
rather
this
first
grinding
,
*NL*
was
followed
by
a
second
,
then
a
third
;
at
the
fourth
,
the
count
knew
*NL*
what
to
expect
.
A
firm
and
well-practised
hand
was
engaged
in
cutting
*NL*
the
four
sides
of
a
pane
of
glass
with
a
diamond
.
The
count
felt
his
*NL*
heart
beat
more
rapidly
.
Inured
as
men
may
be
to
danger
,
forewarned
as
*NL*
they
may
be
of
peril
,
they
understand
,
by
the
fluttering
of
the
heart
*NL*
and
the
shuddering
of
the
frame
,
the
enormous
difference
between
a
dream
*NL*
and
a
reality
,
between
the
project
and
the
execution
.
However
,
Monte
*NL*
Cristo
only
made
a
sign
to
apprise
Ali
,
who
,
understanding
that
danger
*NL*
was
approaching
from
the
other
side
,
drew
nearer
to
his
master
.
Monte
*NL*
Cristo
was
eager
to
ascertain
the
strength
and
number
of
his
enemies
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
window
whence
the
noise
proceeded
was
opposite
the
opening
by
which
*NL*
the
count
could
see
into
the
dressing-room
.
He
fixed
his
eyes
on
that
*NL*
window
--
he
distinguished
a
shadow
in
the
darkness
;
then
one
of
the
panes
*NL*
became
quite
opaque
,
as
if
a
sheet
of
paper
were
stuck
on
the
outside
,
*NL*
then
the
square
cracked
without
falling
.
Through
the
opening
an
arm
was
*NL*
passed
to
find
the
fastening
,
then
a
second
;
the
window
turned
on
its
*NL*
hinges
,
and
a
man
entered
.
He
was
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
a
daring
rascal
,
''
whispered
the
count
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
Ali
touched
him
slightly
on
the
shoulder
.
He
turned
;
Ali
*NL*
pointed
to
the
window
of
the
room
in
which
they
were
,
facing
the
street
.
*NL*
``
I
see
!
''
said
he
,
``
there
are
two
of
them
;
one
does
the
work
while
the
*NL*
other
stands
guard
.
''
He
made
a
sign
to
Ali
not
to
lose
sight
of
the
man
*NL*
in
the
street
,
and
turned
to
the
one
in
the
dressing-room
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
glass-cutter
had
entered
,
and
was
feeling
his
way
,
his
arms
*NL*
stretched
out
before
him
.
At
last
he
appeared
to
have
made
himself
*NL*
familiar
with
his
surroundings
.
There
were
two
doors
;
he
bolted
them
*NL*
both
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
drew
near
to
the
bedroom
door
,
Monte
Cristo
expected
that
he
was
*NL*
coming
in
,
and
raised
one
of
his
pistols
;
but
he
simply
heard
the
sound
*NL*
of
the
bolts
sliding
in
their
copper
rings
.
It
was
only
a
precaution
.
*NL*
The
nocturnal
visitor
,
ignorant
of
the
fact
that
the
count
had
removed
*NL*
the
staples
,
might
now
think
himself
at
home
,
and
pursue
his
purpose
*NL*
with
full
security
.
Alone
and
free
to
act
as
he
wished
,
the
man
then
*NL*
drew
from
his
pocket
something
which
the
count
could
not
discern
,
placed
*NL*
it
on
a
stand
,
then
went
straight
to
the
secretary
,
felt
the
lock
,
and
*NL*
contrary
to
his
expectation
found
that
the
key
was
missing
.
But
the
*NL*
glass-cutter
was
a
prudent
man
who
had
provided
for
all
emergencies
.
The
*NL*
count
soon
heard
the
rattling
of
a
bunch
of
skeleton
keys
,
such
as
the
*NL*
locksmith
brings
when
called
to
force
a
lock
,
and
which
thieves
call
*NL*
nightingales
,
doubtless
from
the
music
of
their
nightly
song
when
they
*NL*
grind
against
the
bolt
.
``
Ah
,
ha
,
''
whispered
Monte
Cristo
with
a
smile
of
*NL*
disappointment
,
``
he
is
only
a
thief
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
man
in
the
dark
could
not
find
the
right
key
.
He
reached
the
*NL*
instrument
he
had
placed
on
the
stand
,
touched
a
spring
,
and
immediately
*NL*
a
pale
light
,
just
bright
enough
to
render
objects
distinct
,
was
*NL*
reflected
on
his
hands
and
countenance
.
``
By
heavens
,
''
exclaimed
Monte
*NL*
Cristo
,
starting
back
,
``
it
is
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
Ali
raised
his
hatchet
.
``
Do
n't
stir
,
''
whispered
Monte
Cristo
,
``
and
put
*NL*
down
your
hatchet
;
we
shall
require
no
arms
.
''
Then
he
added
some
words
*NL*
in
a
low
tone
,
for
the
exclamation
which
surprise
had
drawn
from
the
*NL*
count
,
faint
as
it
had
been
,
had
startled
the
man
who
remained
in
the
*NL*
pose
of
the
old
knife-grinder
.
It
was
an
order
the
count
had
just
given
,
*NL*
for
immediately
Ali
went
noiselessly
,
and
returned
,
bearing
a
black
*NL*
dress
and
a
three-cornered
hat
.
Meanwhile
Monte
Cristo
had
rapidly
taken
*NL*
off
his
great-coat
,
waistcoat
,
and
shirt
,
and
one
might
distinguish
by
*NL*
the
glimmering
through
the
open
panel
that
he
wore
a
pliant
tunic
of
*NL*
steel
mail
,
of
which
the
last
in
France
,
where
daggers
are
no
longer
*NL*
dreaded
,
was
worn
by
King
Louis
XVI.
,
who
feared
the
dagger
at
his
*NL*
breast
,
and
whose
head
was
cleft
with
a
hatchet
.
The
tunic
soon
*NL*
disappeared
under
a
long
cassock
,
as
did
his
hair
under
a
priest
's
wig
;
*NL*
the
three-cornered
hat
over
this
effectually
transformed
the
count
into
*NL*
an
abbe
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
,
hearing
nothing
more
,
stood
erect
,
and
while
Monte
Cristo
was
*NL*
completing
his
disguise
had
advanced
straight
to
the
secretary
,
whose
*NL*
lock
was
beginning
to
crack
under
his
nightingale
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Try
again
,
''
whispered
the
count
,
who
depended
on
the
secret
spring
,
*NL*
which
was
unknown
to
the
picklock
,
clever
as
he
might
be
--
``
try
again
,
*NL*
you
have
a
few
minutes
'
work
there
.
''
And
he
advanced
to
the
window
.
*NL*
The
man
whom
he
had
seen
seated
on
a
fence
had
got
down
,
and
was
still
*NL*
pacing
the
street
;
but
,
strange
as
it
appeared
,
he
cared
not
for
those
*NL*
who
might
pass
from
the
avenue
of
the
Champs-Elysees
or
by
the
Faubourg
*NL*
St.
Honore
;
his
attention
was
engrossed
with
what
was
passing
at
the
*NL*
count
's
,
and
his
only
aim
appeared
to
be
to
discern
every
movement
in
*NL*
the
dressing-room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Monte
Cristo
suddenly
struck
his
finger
on
his
forehead
and
a
smile
*NL*
passed
over
his
lips
;
then
drawing
near
to
Ali
,
he
whispered
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Remain
here
,
concealed
in
the
dark
,
and
whatever
noise
you
hear
,
*NL*
whatever
passes
,
only

Ali
bowed
*NL*
in
token
of
strict
obedience

Monte
Cristo
then
drew
a
lighted
taper
*NL*
from
a
closet
,
and
when
the
thief
was
deeply
engaged
with
his
lock
,
*NL*
silently
opened
the
door
,
taking
care
that
the
light
should
shine
*NL*
directly
on
his
face
.
The
door
opened
so
quietly
that
the
thief
heard
no
*NL*
sound
;
but
,
to
his
astonishment
,
the
room
was
suddenly
illuminated
.
He
*NL*
turned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
good-evening
,
my
dear
M.
Caderousse
,

said
Monte

;
``
what
are
*NL*
you
doing
here
,
at

an
hour

*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Abbe
Busoni
!

exclaimed
Caderousse
;
and
,
not
knowing
how
this
*NL*
strange
apparition
could
have
entered
when
he
had
bolted
the
doors
,
he
*NL*
let
fall
his
bunch
of
keys
,
and
remained
motionless
and
stupefied
.
The
*NL*
count
placed
himself
between
Caderousse
and
the
window
,
thus
cutting
off
*NL*
from
the
thief
his
only
chance
of
retreat
.
``
The
Abbe
Busoni
!
''
repeated
*NL*
Caderousse
,
fixing
his
haggard
gaze
on
the
count
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

undoubtedly

himself

replied
Monte

very
glad

This
*NL*
calmness
of
Busoni
,
combined
with
his
irony
and
boldness
,
staggered
*NL*
Caderousse
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

clinching
his

chattering

Caderousse

seeking
to
regain

the

pitilessly
blocked

Listen

Yes

*NL*

--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then

asked
Caderousse
,
shuddering
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
shall
believe
God
has
forgiven
you

and
I
will
forgive

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
true
as
I
am
a

''
stammered
Caderousse
,
``
you
will
make
me
*NL*
die
of
fright
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
begone

''
said
the
count
,
pointing
to
the
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
Caderousse
,
scarcely
yet
relying
on
this
promise
,
put
his
legs
out
*NL*
of
the
window
and
stood
on
the
ladder
.
``
Now
go
down
,
''
said
the
abbe
,
*NL*
folding
his
arms
.
Understanding
he
had
nothing
more
to
fear
from
him
,
*NL*
Caderousse
began
to
go
down
.
Then
the
count
brought
the
taper
to
the
*NL*
window
,
that
it
might
be
seen
in
the
Champs-Elysees
that
a
man
was
*NL*
getting
out
of
the
window
while
another
held
a
light
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
doing
,
reverend
sir
?
Suppose
a
watchman
should
pass
?
''
And
*NL*
he
blew
out
the
light
.
He
then
descended
,
but
it
was
only
when
he
felt
*NL*
his
foot
touch
the
ground
that
he
was
satisfied
of
his
safety
.
*NL*
*NL*
Monte
Cristo
returned
to
his
bedroom
,
and
,
glancing
rapidly
from
the
*NL*
garden
to
the
street
,
he
saw
first
Caderousse
,
who
after
walking
to
the
*NL*
end
of
the
garden
,
fixed
his
ladder
against
the
wall
at
a
different
part
*NL*
from
where
he
came
in
.
The
count
then
looking
over
into
the
street
,
saw
*NL*
the
man
who
appeared
to
be
waiting
run
in
the
same
direction
,
and
place
*NL*
himself
against
the
angle
of
the
wall
where
Caderousse
would
come
over
.
*NL*
Caderousse
climbed
the
ladder
slowly
,
and
looked
over
the
coping
to
see
*NL*
if
the
street
was
quiet
.
No
one
could
be
seen
or
heard
.
The
clock
of
*NL*
the
Invalides
struck
one
.
Then
Caderousse
sat
astride
the
coping
,
and
*NL*
drawing
up
his
ladder
passed
it
over
the
wall
;
then
he
began
to
descend
,
*NL*
or
rather
to
slide
down
by
the
two
stanchions
,
which
he
did
with
an
ease
*NL*
which
proved
how
accustomed
he
was
to
the
exercise
.
But
,
once
started
,
*NL*
he
could
not
stop
.
In
vain
did
he
see
a
man
start
from
the
shadow
when
*NL*
he
was
halfway
down
--
in
vain
did
he
see
an
arm
raised
as
he
touched
the
*NL*
ground
.
Before
he
could
defend
himself
that
arm
struck
him
so
violently
*NL*
in
the
back
that
he
let
go
the
ladder
,
crying
,
``
Help
!
''
A
second
blow
*NL*
struck
him
almost
immediately
in
the
side
,
and
he
fell
,
calling
,
``
Help
,
*NL*
murder
!
''
Then
,
as
he
rolled
on
the
ground
,
his
adversary
seized
him
by
*NL*
the
hair
,
and
struck
him
a
third
blow
in
the
chest
.
This
time
Caderousse
*NL*
endeavored
to
call
again
,
but
he
could
only
utter
a
groan
,
and
he
*NL*
shuddered
as
the
blood
flowed
from
his
three
wounds
.
The
assassin
,
*NL*
finding
that
he
no
longer
cried
out
,
lifted
his
head
up
by
the
hair
;
his
*NL*
eyes
were
closed
,
and
the
mouth
was
distorted
.
The
murderer
,
supposing
*NL*
him
dead
,
let
fall
his
head
and
disappeared
.
Then
Caderousse
,
feeling
*NL*
that
he
was
leaving
him
,
raised
himself
on
his
elbow
,
and
with
a
dying
*NL*
voice
cried
with
great
effort
,
``
Murder
!
I
am
dying
!
Help
,
reverend
*NL*
sir
,
--
help
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
mournful
appeal
pierced
the
darkness
.
The
door
of
the
*NL*
back-staircase
opened
,
then
the
side-gate
of
the
garden
,
and
Ali
and
his
*NL*
master
were
on
the
spot
with
lights
.

Caderousse
continued
to
call
piteously
,
``
Help
,
reverend
sir

!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
matter
?
''
asked
Monte

.
*NL*
*NL*
``

cried
Caderousse
;

*NL*
``

*NL*
``
Ah

late
--

to

die

*NL*
What
blows
,
what
blood
!
''
He
fainted
.
Ali
and
his
master
conveyed
the
*NL*
wounded
man
into
a
room
.
Monte
Cristo
motioned
to
Ali
to
undress
him
,
*NL*
and
he
then
examined
his
dreadful
wounds
.
``
My
God
!
''
he
exclaimed
,
``
thy
*NL*
vengeance
is
sometimes
delayed
,
but
only
that
it
may
fall
the
more
*NL*
effectually
.
''
Ali
looked
at
his
master
for
further
instructions
.
``
Bring
*NL*
here
immediately
the
king
's
attorney
,
M.

Villefort

As

''
Ali
obeyed
,
leaving
the
abbe
alone
with
Caderousse
,
*NL*
who
had
not
yet
revived
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
wretched
man
again
opened
his
eyes
,
the
count
looked
at
him
*NL*
with
a
mournful
expression
of
pity
,
and
his
lips
moved
as
if
in
prayer
.
*NL*
``
A
surgeon
,
reverend
sir

said
Caderousse
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
sent
for

replied
the

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

*NL*
``
Against

the

thus
become

*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait

''
said
Monte
Cristo
.
He
left
the
room
,
and
returned
*NL*
in
five
minutes
with
a
phial
.
The
dying
man
's
eyes
were
all
the
time
*NL*
riveted
on
the
door
,
through
which
he
hoped
succor
would
arrive
.
*NL*
``
Hasten
,
reverend
sir
,
hasten
!
I
shall
faint
again

''
Monte
Cristo
*NL*
approached
,
and
dropped
on
his
purple
lips
three
or
four
drops
of
the
*NL*
contents
of
the
phial
.
Caderousse
drew
a
deep
breath
.
``
Oh

''
said
he
,
*NL*
``
that
is
life
to
me

*NL*
*NL*
``
Two
drops

replied
the

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

yes

''
said
Caderousse
;
and
his
eyes
glistened
at
the
thought
of
*NL*
this
posthumous
revenge
.
Monte
Cristo
wrote
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
die

murdered

Corsican
Benedetto

galleys

*NL*
*NL*
``
Quick

said
Caderousse
,
``
or
I
shall
be
unable

*NL*
*NL*
Monte
Cristo
gave
the
pen
to
Caderousse
,
who
collected
all
his
strength
,
*NL*
signed
it
,
and
fell
back
on
his
bed
,
saying
:
``
You
will
relate
all

He
*NL*
lodges
at
the
Hotel
des
Princes

Oh

I

He
again
fainted
.
The
*NL*
abbe
made
him
smell
the
contents
of
the
phial
,
and
he
again
opened
his
*NL*
eyes
.
His
desire
for
revenge
had
not
forsaken
him

up

``

the
abbe

in
a
tone

made
the
dying
man
shudder

Caderousse
looked
at

with
amazement

up

Caderousse

``
When
you
had
betrayed
your
friend
God
*NL*
began
not

strike

warn

You
had
*NL*
already
passed
half
your
life
in
coveting
that
which
you
might
have

honorably
acquired

and
already
you
contemplated
crime
under
the
excuse

want

when
God
worked
a
miracle
in

sending
you

by
my
*NL*
hands

a
fortune

brilliant

indeed

for
you

who
had
never
possessed
*NL*
any

But
this
unexpected
,
unhoped-for

unheard-of
fortune
sufficed
*NL*
you
no

when
you

possessed
it

you
wished

double
it

*NL*
how

by

You
succeeded

opened

rescue
two

more
than

committed

Caderousse

fixing
his

on
the

count

``
Look
well

said
Monte

putting
the
light
near
his
*NL*
face
.
``
Well

the
abbe
--
the
Abbe
Busoni
.
''
Monte
Cristo
took
off
the
wig
*NL*
which
disfigured
him
,
and
let
fall
his
black
hair
,
which
added
so
*NL*
much
to
the
beauty
of
his
pallid
features
.
``
Oh
?
''
said
Caderousse
,
*NL*
thunderstruck
,
``
but
for
that
black

I
should
say
you
were
the

Lord

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
neither
the

said
Monte

;
*NL*
``

Those
was
a
magic
effect
in
*NL*
the
count
's
words
,
which
once
more
revived
the
exhausted
powers
of
the
*NL*
miserable
man
.
``
Yes

indeed

said
he
;
``
I

another

*NL*
``

Caderousse
,
supported
by
a
supernatural
*NL*
power
,
and
half-raising
himself
to
see
more
distinctly
the
man
who
had
*NL*
just
taken
the
oath
which
all
men
hold
sacred
;
``
who
,
then
,
are
you

''
*NL*
The
count
had
watched
the
approach
of
death
.
He
knew
this
was
the
last
*NL*
struggle
.
He
approached
the
dying
man
,
and
,
leaning
over
him
with
a
calm
*NL*
and
melancholy
look
,
he
whispered
,
``
I
am
--
I
am
''
--
And
his
almost
closed
*NL*
lips
uttered
a
name
so
low
that
the
count
himself
appeared
afraid
to
*NL*
hear
it
.
Caderousse
,
who
had
raised
himself
on
his
knees
,
and
stretched
*NL*
out
his
arm
,
tried
to
draw
back
,
then
clasping
his
hands
,
and
raising
*NL*
them
with
a
desperate
effort
,
``
O
my
God
,
my
God
!

said
he
,
``
pardon
me
*NL*
for
having
denied
thee

and
his

despised
*NL*
thee

Pardon

Caderousse
sighed
*NL*
deeply
,
and
fell
back
with
a
groan
.
The
blood
no
longer
flowed
from
his
*NL*
wounds

He
was
dead
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One

said
the
count
mysteriously
,
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
corpse
,
*NL*
disfigured
by
so
awful
a
death
.
Ten
minutes
afterwards
the
surgeon
and
*NL*
the
procureur
arrived
,
the
one
accompanied
by
the
porter
,
the
other
by

Ali

Beauchamp
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
daring
attempt
to
rob
the
count
was
the
topic
of
conversation
*NL*
throughout
Paris
for
the
next
fortnight
.
The
dying
man
had
signed
a
*NL*
deposition
declaring
Benedetto
to
be
the
assassin
.
The
police
had
orders
*NL*
to
make
the
strictest
search
for
the
murderer
.
Caderousse
's
knife
,
dark
*NL*
lantern
,
bunch
of
keys
,
and
clothing
,
excepting
the
waistcoat
,
which
*NL*
could
not
be
found
,
were
deposited
at
the
registry
;
the
corpse
was
*NL*
conveyed
to
the
morgue
.
The
count
told
every
one
that
this
adventure
had
*NL*
happened
during
his
absence
at
Auteuil
,
and
that
he
only
knew
what
*NL*
was
related
by
the
Abbe
Busoni
,
who
that
evening
,
by
mere
chance
,
had
*NL*
requested
to
pass
the
night
in
his
house
,
to
examine
some
valuable
books
*NL*
in
his
library
.
Bertuccio
alone
turned
pale
whenever
Benedetto
's
name
*NL*
was
mentioned
in
his
presence
,
but
there
was
no
reason
why
any
one
*NL*
should
notice
his
doing
so
.
Villefort
,
being
called
on
to
prove
*NL*
the
crime
,
was
preparing
his
brief
with
the
same
ardor
that
he
was
*NL*
accustomed
to
exercise
when
required
to
speak
in
criminal
cases
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
three
weeks
had
already
passed
,
and
the
most
diligent
search
had
*NL*
been
unsuccessful
;
the
attempted
robbery
and
the
murder
of
the
robber
*NL*
by
his
comrade
were
almost
forgotten
in
anticipation
of
the
approaching
*NL*
marriage
of
Mademoiselle
Danglars
to
the
Count
Andrea
Cavalcanti
.
It
was
*NL*
expected
that
this
wedding
would
shortly
take
place
,
as
the
young
*NL*
man
was
received
at
the
banker
's
as
the
betrothed
.
Letters
had
been
*NL*
despatched
to
M.
Cavalcanti
,
as
the
count
's
father
,
who
highly
approved
*NL*
of
the
union
,
regretted
his
inability
to
leave
Parma
at
that
time
,
and
*NL*
promised
a
wedding
gift
of
a
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
livres
.
It
*NL*
was
agreed
that
the
three
millions
should
be
intrusted
to
Danglars
to
*NL*
invest
;
some
persons
had
warned
the
young
man
of
the
circumstances
of
*NL*
his
future
father-in-law
,
who
had
of
late
sustained
repeated
losses
;
but
*NL*
with
sublime
disinterestedness
and
confidence
the
young
man
refused
*NL*
to
listen
,
or
to
express
a
single
doubt
to
the
baron
.
The
baron
adored
*NL*
Count
Andrea
Cavalcanti
:
not
so
Mademoiselle
Eugenie
Danglars
.
With
an
*NL*
instinctive
hatred
of
matrimony
,
she
suffered
Andrea
's
attentions
*NL*
in
order
to
get
rid
of
Morcerf
;
but
when
Andrea
urged
his
suit
,
she
*NL*
betrayed
an
entire
dislike
to
him
.
The
baron
might
possibly
have
*NL*
perceived
it
,
but
,
attributing
it
to
a
caprice
,
feigned
ignorance
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
delay
demanded
by
Beauchamp
had
nearly
expired
.
Morcerf
appreciated
*NL*
the
advice
of
Monte
Cristo
to
let
things
die
away
of
their
own
accord
.
*NL*
No
one
had
taken
up
the
remark
about
the
general
,
and
no
one
had
*NL*
recognized
in
the
officer
who
betrayed
the
castle
of
Yanina
the
noble
*NL*
count
in
the
House
of
Peers
.
Albert
,
however
felt
no
less
insulted
;
the
*NL*
few
lines
which
had
irritated
him
were
certainly
intended
as
an
insult
.
*NL*
Besides
,
the
manner
in
which
Beauchamp
had
closed
the
conference
left
a
*NL*
bitter
recollection
in
his
heart
.
He
cherished
the
thought
of
the
duel
,
*NL*
hoping
to
conceal
its
true
cause
even
from
his
seconds
.
Beauchamp
had
*NL*
not
been
seen
since
the
day
he
visited
Albert
,
and
those
of
whom
the
*NL*
latter
inquired
always
told
him
he
was
out
on
a
journey
which
would
*NL*
detain
him
some
days
.
Where
he
was
no
one
knew
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
morning
Albert
was
awakened
by
his
valet
de
chambre
,
who
announced
*NL*
Beauchamp
.
Albert
rubbed
his
eyes
,
ordered
his
servant
to
introduce
*NL*
him
into
the
small
smoking-room
on
the
ground-floor
,
dressed
himself
*NL*
quickly
,
and
went
down
.
He
found
Beauchamp
pacing
the
room
;
on
*NL*
perceiving
him
Beauchamp
stopped
.
``
Your
arrival
here
,
without
waiting
my
*NL*
visit
at
your
house
to-day
,
looks
well
,

''
said
Albert
.
``
Tell
me
,
may

hands
with
you

saying

`
Beauchamp

acknowledge
you

injured

me

my
friendship

I
simply
propose
to
you

choice
*NL*
of
arms

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
Beauchamp
,
with
a
look
of
sorrow
which
stupefied
the
*NL*
young
man
,
``

us
first
sit
down
and
talk

*NL*
*NL*
``
Rather

said
the

*NL*
*NL*
``

not
enough

questions

concern
the
honor
,
the
social
interest
,
and
the
life

such
a

*NL*

What
I

done

reasoned
thus

money

nothing

with
the
reputation

interests
of

suffice

justify

Morcerf

impatiently

I
should
not
have
taken
this
trouble
;
*NL*
but
I
thought
this
mark
of
consideration
due
to
you

I
took
a
week
to

go
,
another
to
return
,
four
days
of
quarantine
,
and
forty-eight
hours
*NL*

stay
there
;
that
makes
three
weeks
.
I
returned
last
night
,
and
here
I
*NL*
am

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
circumlocution

How
long
you
are

*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
so

''
murmured
the
journalist
;
``
on

*NL*
*NL*
Albert
turned
frightfully
pale
;
he
endeavored
to
speak
,
but
the
words
*NL*
died
on
his
lips
.
``
My
friend

''
said
Beauchamp
,
in
the
most
affectionate
*NL*
tone
,
``
I
should
gladly
make
an
apology
;
but
,
alas

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
paragraph
was
correct

*NL*
``
What
?
That
French
officer

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

*NL*
*NL*
``
The
traitor

surrendered

was

--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pardon
me
,
my
friend
,
that
man
was
your
father
!
''
Albert
advanced
*NL*
furiously
towards
Beauchamp
,
but
the
latter
restrained
him
more
by
a
*NL*
mild
look
than
by
his
extended
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
friend
,
''
said
he
,
``
here
is
a
proof
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Albert
opened
the
paper
,
it
was
an
attestation
of
four
notable
*NL*
inhabitants
of
Yanina
,
proving
that
Colonel
Fernand
Mondego
,
in
the
*NL*
service
of
Ali
Tepelini
,
had
surrendered
the
castle
for
two
million
*NL*
crowns
.
The
signatures
were
perfectly
legal
.
Albert
tottered
and
fell
*NL*
overpowered
in
a
chair
.
It
could
no
longer
be
doubted
;
the
family
*NL*
name
was
fully
given
.
After
a
moment
's
mournful
silence
,
his
heart
*NL*
overflowed
,
and
he
gave
way
to
a
flood
of
tears
.
Beauchamp
,
who
had
*NL*
watched
with
sincere
pity
the
young
man
's
paroxysm
of
grief
,
approached
*NL*
him
.
``
Now
,
Albert
,
''
said
he
,
``
you
understand
me
--
do
you
not
?
I
wished
to
*NL*
see
all
,
and
to
judge
of
everything
for
myself
,
hoping
the
explanation
*NL*
would
be
in
your
father
's
favor
,
and
that
I
might
do
him
justice
.
But
,
*NL*
on
the
contrary
,
the
particulars
which
are
given
prove
that
Fernand
*NL*
Mondego
,
raised
by
Ali
Pasha
to
the
rank
of
governor-general
,
is
no
*NL*
other
than
Count
Fernand
of
Morcerf
;
then
,
recollecting
the
honor
you
*NL*
had
done
me
,
in
admitting
me
to
your
friendship
,
I
hastened
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Albert
,
still
extended
on
the
chair
,
covered
his
face
with
both
hands
,
*NL*
as
if
to
prevent
the
light
from
reaching
him
.
``
I
hastened
to
you
,
''
*NL*
continued
Beauchamp
,
``
to
tell
you
,
Albert
,
that
in
this
changing
age
,
*NL*
the
faults
of
a
father
can
not
revert
upon
his
children
.
Few
have
passed
*NL*
through
this
revolutionary
period
,
in
the
midst
of
which
we
were
*NL*
born
,
without
some
stain
of
infamy
or
blood
to
soil
the
uniform
of
the
*NL*
soldier
,
or
the
gown
of
the
magistrate
.
Now
I
have
these
proofs
,
Albert
,
*NL*
and
I
am
in
your
confidence
,
no
human
power
can
force
me
to
a
duel
which
*NL*
your
own
conscience
would
reproach
you
with
as
criminal
,
but
I
come
to
*NL*
offer
you
what
you
can
no
longer
demand
of
me
.
Do
you
wish
these
proofs
,
*NL*
these
attestations
,
which
I
alone
possess
,
to
be
destroyed

Do
you
wish
*NL*
this
frightful
secret
to
remain
with
us

Confided
to
me
,
it
shall
never
*NL*
escape
my
lips

say
,
Albert
,
my
friend
,
do
you
wish
it

*NL*
*NL*
Albert
threw
himself
on
Beauchamp
's
neck
.
``
Ah

noble
fellow
!
''
cried
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
these

''
said
Beauchamp
,
presenting
the
papers
to
Albert
.
*NL*
*NL*
Albert
seized
them
with
a
convulsive
hand
,
tore
them
in
pieces
,
and
*NL*
trembling
lest
the
least
vestige
should
escape
and
one
day
appear
to
*NL*
confront
him
,
he
approached
the
wax-light
,
always
kept
burning
for
*NL*
cigars
,
and
burned
every
fragment
.
``
Dear
,
excellent
friend

murmured
*NL*
Albert
,
still
burning
the
papers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
all
be
forgotten
as
a
sorrowful
dream

said
Beauchamp
;
``
let
it
*NL*
vanish
as
the
last
sparks
from
the
blackened
paper

disappear
as
the
*NL*
smoke
from
those
silent
ashes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

yes

''
said
Albert
,
``
and
may
there
remain
only
the
eternal

*NL*
to
our
children

shall
always
remind
me
that
I
owe
my

life

the
honor

you

for
had
this
been
known
,
oh

*NL*
Beauchamp

I
should
have
destroyed
myself

no

poor
mother

I
*NL*
could
not

killed
her
by

have
fled
from

country

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
Albert

said
Beauchamp

But
this
sudden
and
factitious
joy
soon
*NL*
forsook
the
young
man

and
was
succeeded
by
a
still
greater
grief

*NL*
*NL*

still
oppresses

I
now
approach
mine

Shall
I
draw
back
my
forehead
from

embrace

withhold
my

I
am
the
most
wretched

gazing
through
his
tears
at

his

done

Then

seeing
the
young
man
was
about
to
relapse
*NL*
into
melancholy
,
``
Let

go
out

Albert

he
;

a
ride
in

wood

refresh

walked
out

fortress

When

arrived
at

Since

out

Danglars
asked
me
for
letters
of
recommendation
for
the
*NL*
impresari
;
I
gave
her
a
few
lines
for
the
director
of
the
Valle
Theatre
,
*NL*
who
is
under
some
obligation
to
me
.
But
what
is
the
matter
,
Albert
?
you
*NL*
look
dull
;
are
you
,
after
all
,
unconsciously
in
love
with
Mademoiselle
*NL*
Eugenie
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
aware
of
it

said
Albert
,
smiling
sorrowfully
.
Beauchamp
*NL*
turned
to
look
at
some
paintings
.
``
But

continued
Monte
Cristo
,
``
you
*NL*
are
not
in

Albert

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

said
Monte

I
have
an
infallible
*NL*
remedy
to
propose
to
you

What

Beauchamp

by

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

you
think
very
lightly

you

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
brief

*NL*
*NL*
``
The
one

*NL*
*NL*
``
True

recollects
having
seen

Consequently

very
active

the
affair

meditation

passing
his

across
his

if

dispel
his
revery

*NL*
he
rang
the
bell
twice
and
Bertuccio
entered

Bertuccio

,

intend
going

despatch

apprise

at
the
first
station

M.

accompany

Bertuccio
obeyed
and
despatched
a
courier
to
Pontoise
to
*NL*
say
the
travelling-carriage
would
arrive
at
six
o'clock

From
Pontoise
*NL*
another
express
was
sent
to
the
next
stage
,
and
in
six
hours
all
the
*NL*
horses
stationed
on
the
road
were
ready

Before
his
departure
,
the
*NL*
count
went
to
Haidee
's
apartments
,
told
her
his
intention
,
and
resigned
*NL*
everything
to
her
care

Albert
was
punctual
.
The
journey
soon
became
*NL*
interesting
from
its
rapidity
,
of
which
Morcerf
had
formed
no
previous
*NL*
idea
.
``
Truly

said
Monte
Cristo
,
``
with
your
posthorses
going
at
the

rate

two
leagues
an
hour

that
absurd
law

one
traveller
*NL*
shall
not
pass
another
without
permission

so
that
an
invalid
or
*NL*
ill-tempered
traveller
may
detain
those
who
are
well
and
active
,
it
is
*NL*
impossible
to
move

I
escape
this
annoyance
by
travelling
with
my

*NL*
postilion
and
horses

I
not

The
count
put
his
head
out
of
the
window
and
whistled
,
and
the
horses
*NL*
appeared
to
fly
.
The
carriage
rolled
with
a
thundering
noise
over
the
*NL*
pavement
,
and
every
one
turned
to
notice
the
dazzling
meteor
.
Ali
,
*NL*
smiling
,
repeated
the
sound
,
grasped
the
reins
with
a
firm
hand
,
and
*NL*
spurred
his
horses
,
whose
beautiful
manes
floated
in
the
breeze

This
*NL*
child
of
the
desert
was
in
his
element

with
his
black
face
and
*NL*
sparkling
eyes
appeared
,
in
the
cloud
of
dust
he
raised
,
like
the
genius
*NL*
of
the
simoom
and
the
god
of
the
hurricane

``
I
never
knew

now

*NL*
delight

the
last
cloud
disappeared
from

his
brow
;
``

where
the
devil
do
you
get
such
horses
?
Are
they
made
to

*NL*
*NL*
``
Precisely

said
the
count

``
six

whole
journey
was
performed
with
equal
rapidity
;
*NL*
the
thirty-two
horses
,
dispersed
over
seven
stages
,
brought
them
to
*NL*
their
destination
in
eight
hours
.
At
midnight
they
arrived
at
the
gate
*NL*
of
a
beautiful
park
.
The
porter
was
in
attendance
;
he
had
been
apprised
*NL*
by
the
groom
of
the
last
stage
of
the
count
's
approach
.
At
half
past
two
*NL*
in
the
morning
Morcerf
was
conducted
to
his
apartments
,
where
a
bath
and
*NL*
supper
were
prepared
.
The
servant
who
had
travelled
at
the
back
of
*NL*
the
carriage
waited
on
him
;
Baptistin
,
who
rode
in
front
,
attended
the
*NL*
count
.
Albert
bathed
,
took
his
supper
,
and
went
to
bed
.
All
night
he
was
*NL*
lulled
by
the
melancholy
noise
of
the
surf
.
On
rising
,
he
went
to
his
*NL*
window
,
which
opened
on
a
terrace
,
having
the
sea
in
front
,
and
at
the
*NL*
back
a
pretty
park
bounded
by
a
small
forest
.
In
a
creek
lay
a
little
*NL*
sloop
,
with
a
narrow
keel
and
high
masts
,
bearing
on
its
flag
the
Monte
*NL*
Cristo
arms
which
were
a
mountain
on
a
sea
azure
,
with
a
cross
gules
*NL*
on
the
shield
.
Around
the
schooner
lay
a
number
of
small
fishing-boats
*NL*
belonging
to
the
fishermen
of
the
neighboring
village
,
like
humble
*NL*
subjects
awaiting
orders
from
their
queen
.
There
,
as
in
every
spot
where
*NL*
Monte
Cristo
stopped
,
if
but
for
two
days
,
luxury
abounded
and
life
went
*NL*
on
with
the
utmost
ease
.
*NL*
*NL*
Albert
found
in
his
anteroom
two
guns
,
with
all
the
accoutrements
for
*NL*
hunting
;
a
lofty
room
on
the
ground-floor
containing
all
the
ingenious
*NL*
instruments
the
English
--
eminent
in
piscatory
pursuits
,
since
they
*NL*
are
patient
and
sluggish
--
have
invented
for
fishing
.
The
day
passed
in
*NL*
pursuing
those
exercises
in
which
Monte
Cristo
excelled
.
They
killed
*NL*
a
dozen
pheasants
in
the
park
,
as
many
trout
in
the
stream
,
dined
in
a
*NL*
summer-house
overlooking
the
ocean
,
and
took
tea
in
the
library
.
*NL*
*NL*
Towards
the
evening
of
the
third
day
.
Albert
,
completely
exhausted
*NL*
with
the
exercise
which
invigorated
Monte
Cristo
,
was
sleeping
in
*NL*
an
arm-chair
near
the
window
,
while
the
count
was
designing
with
his
*NL*
architect
the
plan
of
a
conservatory
in
his
house
,
when
the
sound
of
*NL*
a
horse
at
full
speed
on
the
high
road
made
Albert
look
up
.
He
was
*NL*
disagreeably
surprised
to
see
his
own
valet
de
chambre
,
whom
he
had
not
*NL*
brought
,
that
he
might
not
inconvenience
Monte
Cristo
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Florentin
here
!
''
cried
he
,
starting
up
;
``
is
my
mother
ill
?
''
And
he
*NL*
hastened
to
the
door
.
Monte
Cristo
watched
and
saw
him
approach
the
*NL*
valet
,
who
drew
a
small
sealed
parcel
from
his
pocket
,
containing
a
*NL*
newspaper
and
a
letter
.
``
From
whom
is
this
?
''
said
he
eagerly
.
``
From
M.
*NL*
Beauchamp
,
''
replied
Florentin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
he
send
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
;
he
sent
for
me
to
his
house
,
gave
me
money
for
my
journey
,
*NL*
procured
a
horse
,
and
made
me
promise
not
to
stop
till
I
had
reached
*NL*
you
,
I
have
come
in
fifteen
hours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Albert
opened
the
letter
with
fear
,
uttered
a
shriek
on
reading
the
*NL*
first
line
,
and
seized
the
paper
.
His
sight
was
dimmed
,
his
legs
sank
*NL*
under
him
,
and
he
would
have
fallen
had
not
Florentin
supported
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
young
man
,
''
said
Monte
Cristo
in
a
low
voice
;
``
it
is
then
true
*NL*
that
the
sin
of
the
father
shall
fall
on
the
children
to
the
third
and
*NL*
fourth
generation
.
''
Meanwhile
Albert
had
revived
,
and
,
continuing
to
*NL*
read
,
he
threw
back
his
head
,
saying
,
``
Florentin
,
is
your
horse
fit
to
*NL*
return
immediately
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
poor
lame
post-horse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
what
state
was
the
house
when
you
left
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
was
quiet
,
but
on
returning
from
M.
Beauchamp
's
,
I
found
madame
in
*NL*
tears
:
she
had
sent
for
me
to
know
when
you
would
return
.
I
told
her
my
*NL*
orders
from
M.
Beauchamp
;
she
first
extended
her
arms
to
prevent
me
,
but
*NL*
after
a
moment
's
reflection
,
`
Yes
,
go
,
Florentin
,
'
said
she
,
`
and
may
he
*NL*
come
quickly
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
my
mother
,
''
said
Albert
,
``
I
will
return
,
and
woe
to
the
infamous
*NL*
wretch
!
But
first
of
all
I
must
get
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
back
to
the
room
where
he
had
left
Monte
Cristo
.
Five
minutes
*NL*
had
sufficed
to
make
a
complete
transformation
in
his
appearance
.
His
*NL*
voice
had
become
rough
and
hoarse
;
his
face
was
furrowed
with
wrinkles
;
*NL*
his
eyes
burned
under
the
blue-veined
lids
,
and
he
tottered
like
a
*NL*
drunken
man
.
``
Count
,
''
said
he
,
``
I
thank
you
for
your
hospitality
,
which
*NL*
I
would
gladly
have
enjoyed
longer
;
but
I
must
return
to
Paris
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
has
happened
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
great
misfortune
,
more
important
to
me
than
life
.
Do
n't
question
me
,
*NL*
I
beg
of
you
,
but
lend
me
a
horse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
stables
are
at
your
command
,
viscount
;
but
you
will
kill
yourself
by
*NL*
riding
on
horseback
.
Take
a
post-chaise
or
a
carriage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
it
would
delay
me
,
and
I
need
the
fatigue
you
warn
me
of
;
it
will
*NL*
do
me
good
.
''
Albert
reeled
as
if
he
had
been
shot
,
and
fell
on
a
chair
*NL*
near
the
door
.
Monte
Cristo
did
not
see
this
second
manifestation
of
*NL*
physical
exhaustion
;
he
was
at
the
window
,
calling
,
``
Ali
,
a
horse
for
*NL*
M.
de
Morcerf
--
quick
!
he
is
in
a
hurry
!
''
These
words
restored
Albert
;
*NL*
he
darted
from
the
room
,
followed
by
the
count
.
``
Thank
you
!
''
cried
he
,
*NL*
throwing
himself
on
his
horse
.
``
Return
as
soon
as
you
can
,
Florentin
.
*NL*
Must
I
use
any
password
to
procure
a
horse
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
dismount
;
another
will
be
immediately
saddled
.
''
Albert
hesitated
a
*NL*
moment
.
``
You
may
think
my
departure
strange
and
foolish
,
''
said
the
young
*NL*
man
;
``
you
do
not
know
how
a
paragraph
in
a
newspaper
may
exasperate
one
.
*NL*
Read
that
,
''
said
he
,
``
when
I
am
gone
,
that
you
may
not
be
witness
of
my
*NL*
anger
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
the
count
picked
up
the
paper
he
put
spurs
to
his
horse
,
which
*NL*
leaped
in
astonishment
at
such
an
unusual
stimulus
,
and
shot
away
*NL*
with
the
rapidity
of
an
arrow
.
The
count
watched
him
with
a
feeling
of
*NL*
compassion
,
and
when
he
had
completely
disappeared
,
read
as
follows
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
French
officer
in
the
service
of
Ali
Pasha
of
Yanina
alluded
to
*NL*
three
weeks
since
in
the
Impartial
,
who
not
only
surrendered
the
castle
*NL*
of
Yanina
,
but
sold
his
benefactor
to
the
Turks
,
styled
himself
truly
at
*NL*
that
time
Fernand
,
as
our
esteemed
contemporary
states
;
but
he
has
since
*NL*
added
to
his
Christian
name
a
title
of
nobility
and
a
family
name
.
He
*NL*
now
calls
himself
the
Count
of
Morcerf
,
and
ranks
among
the
peers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
the
terrible
secret
,
which
Beauchamp
had
so
generously
destroyed
,
*NL*
appeared
again
like
an
armed
phantom
;
and
another
paper
,
deriving
its
*NL*
information
from
some
malicious
source
,
had
published
two
days
after
*NL*
Albert
's
departure
for
Normandy
the
few
lines
which
had
rendered
the
*NL*
unfortunate
young
man
almost
crazy
.

Chapter
86
.
The
Trial
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
eight
o'clock
in
the
morning
Albert
had
arrived
at
Beauchamp
's
*NL*
door
.
The
valet
de
chambre
had
received
orders
to
usher
him
in
at
once
.
*NL*
Beauchamp
was
in
his
bath
.
``
Here
I
am
,
''
said
Albert
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
my
poor
friend
,
''
replied
Beauchamp
,
``
I
expected
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
need
not
say
I
think
you
are
too
faithful
and
too
kind
to
have
spoken
*NL*
of
that
painful
circumstance
.
Your
having
sent
for
me
is
another
proof
*NL*
of
your
affection
.
So
,
without
losing
time
,
tell
me
,
have
you
the
*NL*
slightest
idea
whence
this
terrible
blow
proceeds
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
have
some
clew
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
first
tell
me
all
the
particulars
of
this
shameful
plot
.
''
Beauchamp
*NL*
proceeded
to
relate
to
the
young
man
,
who
was
overwhelmed
with
shame
*NL*
and
grief
,
the
following
facts
.
Two
days
previously
,
the
article
had
*NL*
appeared
in
another
paper
besides
the
Impartial
,
and
,
what
was
more
*NL*
serious
,
one
that
was
well
known
as
a
government
paper
.
Beauchamp
was
*NL*
breakfasting
when
he
read
the
paragraph
.
He
sent
immediately
for
a
*NL*
cabriolet
,
and
hastened
to
the
publisher
's
office
.
Although
professing
*NL*
diametrically
opposite
principles
from
those
of
the
editor
of
the
other
*NL*
paper
,
Beauchamp
--
as
it
sometimes
,
we
may
say
often
,
happens
--
was
*NL*
his
intimate
friend
.
The
editor
was
reading
,
with
apparent
delight
,
a
*NL*
leading
article
in
the
same
paper
on
beet-sugar
,
probably
a
composition
*NL*
of
his
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
pardieu
,
''
said
Beauchamp
,
``
with
the
paper
in
your
hand
,
my
friend
,
*NL*
I
need
not
tell
you
the
cause
of
my
visit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
interested
in
the
sugar
question
?
''
asked
the
editor
of
the
*NL*
ministerial
paper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
replied
Beauchamp
,
``
I
have
not
considered
the
question
;
a
totally
*NL*
different
subject
interests
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
article
relative
to
Morcerf
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
?
Is
it
not
a
curious
affair
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
curious
,
that
I
think
you
are
running
a
great
risk
of
a
prosecution
*NL*
for
defamation
of
character
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all
;
we
have
received
with
the
information
all
the
requisite
*NL*
proofs
,
and
we
are
quite
sure
M.
de
Morcerf
will
not
raise
his
voice
*NL*
against
us
;
besides
,
it
is
rendering
a
service
to
one
's
country
to
*NL*
denounce
these
wretched
criminals
who
are
unworthy
of
the
honor
bestowed
*NL*
on
them
.
''
Beauchamp
was
thunderstruck
.
``
Who
,
then
,
has
so
correctly
*NL*
informed
you
?
''
asked
he
;
``
for
my
paper
,
which
gave
the
first
information
*NL*
on
the
subject
,
has
been
obliged
to
stop
for
want
of
proof
;
and
yet
we
*NL*
are
more
interested
than
you
in
exposing
M.
de
Morcerf
,
as
he
is
a
peer
*NL*
of
France
,
and
we
are
of
the
opposition
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
that
is
very
simple
;
we
have
not
sought
to
scandalize
.
This
news
*NL*
was
brought
to
us
.
A
man
arrived
yesterday
from
Yanina
,
bringing
a
*NL*
formidable
array
of
documents
;
and
when
we
hesitated
to
publish
the
*NL*
accusatory
article
,
he
told
us
it
should
be
inserted
in
some
other
*NL*
paper
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Beauchamp
understood
that
nothing
remained
but
to
submit
,
and
left
the
*NL*
office
to
despatch
a
courier
to
Morcerf
.
But
he
had
been
unable
to
send
*NL*
to
Albert
the
following
particulars
,
as
the
events
had
transpired
after
*NL*
the
messenger
's
departure
;
namely
,
that
the
same
day
a
great
agitation
*NL*
was
manifest
in
the
House
of
Peers
among
the
usually
calm
members
of
*NL*
that
dignified
assembly
.
Every
one
had
arrived
almost
before
the
usual
*NL*
hour
,
and
was
conversing
on
the
melancholy
event
which
was
to
attract
*NL*
the
attention
of
the
public
towards
one
of
their
most
illustrious
*NL*
colleagues
.
Some
were
perusing
the
article
,
others
making
comments
and
*NL*
recalling
circumstances
which
substantiated
the
charges
still
more
.
The
*NL*
Count
of
Morcerf
was
no
favorite
with
his
colleagues
.
Like
all
upstarts
,
*NL*
he
had
had
recourse
to
a
great
deal
of
haughtiness
to
maintain
his
*NL*
position
.
The
true
nobility
laughed
at
him
,
the
talented
repelled
him
,
*NL*
and
the
honorable
instinctively
despised
him
.
He
was
,
in
fact
,
in
the
*NL*
unhappy
position
of
the
victim
marked
for
sacrifice
;
the
finger
of
God
*NL*
once
pointed
at
him
,
every
one
was
prepared
to
raise
the
hue
and
cry
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Count
of
Morcerf
alone
was
ignorant
of
the
news
.
He
did
not
take
in
*NL*
the
paper
containing
the
defamatory
article
,
and
had
passed
the
morning
*NL*
in
writing
letters
and
in
trying
a
horse
.
He
arrived
at
his
usual
hour
,
*NL*
with
a
proud
look
and
insolent
demeanor
;
he
alighted
,
passed
through
the
*NL*
corridors
,
and
entered
the
house
without
observing
the
hesitation
of
*NL*
the
door-keepers
or
the
coolness
of
his
colleagues
.
Business
had
already
*NL*
been
going
on
for
half
an
hour
when
he
entered
.
Every
one
held
the
*NL*
accusing
paper
,
but
,
as
usual
,
no
one
liked
to
take
upon
himself
the
*NL*
responsibility
of
the
attack
.
At
length
an
honorable
peer
,
Morcerf
's
*NL*
acknowledged
enemy
,
ascended
the
tribune
with
that
solemnity
which
*NL*
announced
that
the
expected
moment
had
arrived
.
There
was
an
impressive
*NL*
silence
;
Morcerf
alone
knew
not
why
such
profound
attention
was
given
to
*NL*
an
orator
who
was
not
always
listened
to
with
so
much
complacency
.
The
*NL*
count
did
not
notice
the
introduction
,
in
which
the
speaker
announced
*NL*
that
his
communication
would
be
of
that
vital
importance
that
it
*NL*
demanded
the
undivided
attention
of
the
House
;
but
at
the
mention
of
*NL*
Yanina
and
Colonel
Fernand
,
he
turned
so
frightfully
pale
that
every
*NL*
member
shuddered
and
fixed
his
eyes
upon
him
.
Moral
wounds
have
this
*NL*
peculiarity
,
--
they
may
be
hidden
,
but
they
never
close
;
always
painful
,
*NL*
always
ready
to
bleed
when
touched
,
they
remain
fresh
and
open
in
the
*NL*
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
article
having
been
read
during
the
painful
hush
that
followed
,
a
*NL*
universal
shudder
pervaded
the
assembly
,
and
immediately
the
closest
*NL*
attention
was
given
to
the
orator
as
he
resumed
his
remarks
.
He
stated
*NL*
his
scruples
and
the
difficulties
of
the
case
;
it
was
the
honor
of
M.
*NL*
de
Morcerf
,
and
that
of
the
whole
House
,
he
proposed
to
defend
,
by
*NL*
provoking
a
debate
on
personal
questions
,
which
are
always
such
painful
*NL*
themes
of
discussion
.
He
concluded
by
calling
for
an
investigation
,
*NL*
which
might
dispose
of
the
calumnious
report
before
it
had
time
to
*NL*
spread
,
and
restore
M.
de
Morcerf
to
the
position
he
had
long
held
in
*NL*
public
opinion
.
Morcerf
was
so
completely
overwhelmed
by
this
great
and
*NL*
unexpected
calamity
that
he
could
scarcely
stammer
a
few
words
as
he
*NL*
looked
around
on
the
assembly
.
This
timidity
,
which
might
proceed
from
*NL*
the
astonishment
of
innocence
as
well
as
the
shame
of
guilt
,
conciliated
*NL*
some
in
his
favor
;
for
men
who
are
truly
generous
are
always
ready
to
*NL*
compassionate
when
the
misfortune
of
their
enemy
surpasses
the
limits
of
*NL*
their
hatred
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
president
put
it
to
the
vote
,
and
it
was
decided
that
the
*NL*
investigation
should
take
place
.
The
count
was
asked
what
time
he
*NL*
required
to
prepare
his
defence
.
Morcerf
's
courage
had
revived
when
he
*NL*
found
himself
alive
after
this
horrible
blow
.
``
My
lords
,
''
answered
*NL*
he
,
``
it
is
not
by
time
I
could
repel
the
attack
made
on
me
by
enemies
*NL*
unknown
to
me
,
and
,
doubtless
,
hidden
in
obscurity
;
it
is
immediately
,
*NL*
and
by
a
thunderbolt
,
that
I
must
repel
the
flash
of
lightning
which
,
*NL*
for
a
moment
,
startled
me
.
Oh
,
that
I
could
,
instead
of
taking
up
this
*NL*
defence
,
shed
my
last
drop
of
blood
to
prove
to
my
noble
colleagues
that
*NL*
I
am
their
equal
in
worth
.
''
These
words
made
a
favorable
impression
on
*NL*
behalf
of
the
accused
.
``
I
demand
,
then
,
that
the
examination
shall
*NL*
take
place
as
soon
as
possible
,
and
I
will
furnish
the
house
with
all
*NL*
necessary
information
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
day
do
you
fix
?
''
asked
the
president
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To-day
I
am
at
your
service
,
''
replied
the
count
.
The
president
rang
*NL*
the
bell
.
``
Does
the
House
approve
that
the
examination
should
take
place
*NL*
to-day
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
was
the
unanimous
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
committee
of
twelve
members
was
chosen
to
examine
the
proofs
brought
*NL*
forward
by
Morcerf
.
The
investigation
would
begin
at
eight
o'clock
that
*NL*
evening
in
the
committee-room
,
and
if
postponement
were
necessary
,
the
*NL*
proceedings
would
be
resumed
each
evening
at
the
same
hour
.
Morcerf
*NL*
asked
leave
to
retire
;
he
had
to
collect
the
documents
he
had
long
been
*NL*
preparing
against
this
storm
,
which
his
sagacity
had
foreseen
.
*NL*
*NL*
Albert
listened
,
trembling
now
with
hope
,
then
with
anger
,
and
then
*NL*
again
with
shame
,
for
from
Beauchamp
's
confidence
he
knew
his
father
was
*NL*
guilty
,
and
he
asked
himself
how
,
since
he
was
guilty
,
he
could
prove
*NL*
his
innocence
.
Beauchamp
hesitated
to
continue
his
narrative
.
``
What
*NL*
next
?
''
asked
Albert
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
next
?
My
friend
,
you
impose
a
painful
task
on
me
.
Must
you
know
*NL*
all
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Absolutely
;
and
rather
from
your
lips
than
another
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Muster
up
all
your
courage
,
then
,
for
never
have
you
required
it
more
.
''
*NL*
Albert
passed
his
hand
over
his
forehead
,
as
if
to
try
his
strength
,
as
*NL*
a
man
who
is
preparing
to
defend
his
life
proves
his
shield
and
bends
*NL*
his
sword
.
He
thought
himself
strong
enough
,
for
he
mistook
fever
for
*NL*
energy
.
``
Go
on
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
evening
arrived
;
all
Paris
was
in
expectation
.
Many
said
your
*NL*
father
had
only
to
show
himself
to
crush
the
charge
against
him
;
many
*NL*
others
said
he
would
not
appear
;
while
some
asserted
that
they
had
seen
*NL*
him
start
for
Brussels
;
and
others
went
to
the
police-office
to
inquire
*NL*
if
he
had
taken
out
a
passport
.
I
used
all
my
influence
with
one
of
the
*NL*
committee
,
a
young
peer
of
my
acquaintance
,
to
get
admission
to
one
of
*NL*
the
galleries
.
He
called
for
me
at
seven
o'clock
,
and
,
before
any
one
*NL*
had
arrived
,
asked
one
of
the
door-keepers
to
place
me
in
a
box
.
I
was
*NL*
concealed
by
a
column
,
and
might
witness
the
whole
of
the
terrible
*NL*
scene
which
was
about
to
take
place
.
At
eight
o'clock
all
were
in
their
*NL*
places
,
and
M.
de
Morcerf
entered
at
the
last
stroke
.
He
held
some
*NL*
papers
in
his
hand
;
his
countenance
was
calm
,
and
his
step
firm
,
and
he
*NL*
was
dressed
with
great
care
in
his
military
uniform
,
which
was
buttoned
*NL*
completely
up
to
the
chin
.
His
presence
produced
a
good
effect
.
The
*NL*
committee
was
made
up
of
Liberals
,
several
of
whom
came
forward
to
shake
*NL*
hands
with
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Albert
felt
his
heart
bursting
at
these
particulars
,
but
gratitude
*NL*
mingled
with
his
sorrow
:
he
would
gladly
have
embraced
those
who
had
*NL*
given
his
father
this
proof
of
esteem
at
a
moment
when
his
honor
was
so
*NL*
powerfully
attacked
.
``
At
this
moment
one
of
the
door-keepers
brought
*NL*
in
a
letter
for
the
president
.
`
You
are
at
liberty
to
speak
,
M.
de
*NL*
Morcerf
,
'
said
the
president
,
as
he
unsealed
the
letter
;
and
the
count
*NL*
began
his
defence
,
I
assure
you
,
Albert
,
in
a
most
eloquent
and
skilful
*NL*
manner
.
He
produced
documents
proving
that
the
Vizier
of
Yanina
had
up
*NL*
to
the
last
moment
honored
him
with
his
entire
confidence
,
since
he
had
*NL*
interested
him
with
a
negotiation
of
life
and
death
with
the
emperor
.
He
*NL*
produced
the
ring
,
his
mark
of
authority
,
with
which
Ali
Pasha
generally
*NL*
sealed
his
letters
,
and
which
the
latter
had
given
him
,
that
he
might
,
*NL*
on
his
return
at
any
hour
of
the
day
or
night
,
gain
access
to
the
*NL*
presence
,
even
in
the
harem
.
Unfortunately
,
the
negotiation
failed
,
and
*NL*
when
he
returned
to
defend
his
benefactor
,
he
was
dead
.
`
But
,
'
said
the
*NL*
count
,
`
so
great
was
Ali
Pasha
's
confidence
,
that
on
his
death-bed
he
*NL*
resigned
his
favorite
mistress
and
her
daughter
to
my
care
.
'
''
Albert
*NL*
started
on
hearing
these
words
;
the
history
of
Haidee
recurred
to
him
,
*NL*
and
he
remembered
what
she
had
said
of
that
message
and
the
ring
,
and
*NL*
the
manner
in
which
she
had
been
sold
and
made
a
slave
.
``
And
what
effect
*NL*
did
this
discourse
produce
?
''
anxiously
inquired
Albert
.
``
I
acknowledge
*NL*
it
affected
me
,
and
,
indeed
,
all
the
committee
also
,
''
said
Beauchamp
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Meanwhile
,
the
president
carelessly
opened
the
letter
which
had
been
*NL*
brought
to
him
;
but
the
first
lines
aroused
his
attention
;
he
read
them
*NL*
again
and
again
,
and
fixing
his
eyes
on
M.
de
Morcerf
,
`
Count
,
'
said
he
,
*NL*
`
you
have
said
that
the
Vizier
of
Yanina
confided
his
wife
and
daughter
*NL*
to
your
care
?
'
--
`
Yes
,
sir
,
'
replied
Morcerf
;
`
but
in
that
,
like
all
the
*NL*
rest
,
misfortune
pursued
me
.
On
my
return
,
Vasiliki
and
her
daughter
*NL*
Haidee
had
disappeared
.
'
--
`
Did
you
know
them
?
'
--
`
My
intimacy
with
the
*NL*
pasha
and
his
unlimited
confidence
had
gained
me
an
introduction
to
*NL*
them
,
and
I
had
seen
them
above
twenty
times
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Have
you
any
idea
what
became
of
them
?
'
--
`
Yes
,
sir
;
I
heard
they
had
*NL*
fallen
victims
to
their
sorrow
,
and
,
perhaps
,
to
their
poverty
.
I
was
*NL*
not
rich
;
my
life
was
in
constant
danger
;
I
could
not
seek
them
,
to
my
*NL*
great
regret
.
'
The
president
frowned
imperceptibly
.
`
Gentlemen
,
'
said
*NL*
he
,
`
you
have
heard
the
Comte
de
Morcerf
's
defence
.
Can
you
,
sir
,
*NL*
produce
any
witnesses
to
the
truth
of
what
you
have
asserted
?
'
--
`
Alas
,
*NL*
no
,
monsieur
,
'
replied
the
count
;
`
all
those
who
surrounded
the
vizier
,
*NL*
or
who
knew
me
at
his
court
,
are
either
dead
or
gone
away
,
I
know
not
*NL*
where
.
I
believe
that
I
alone
,
of
all
my
countrymen
,
survived
that
*NL*
dreadful
war
.
I
have
only
the
letters
of
Ali
Tepelini
,
which
I
have
*NL*
placed
before
you
;
the
ring
,
a
token
of
his
good-will
,
which
is
here
;
*NL*
and
,
lastly
,
the
most
convincing
proof
I
can
offer
,
after
an
anonymous
*NL*
attack
,
and
that
is
the
absence
of
any
witness
against
my
veracity
and
*NL*
the
purity
of
my
military
life
.
'
A
murmur
of
approbation
ran
through
the
*NL*
assembly
;
and
at
this
moment
,
Albert
,
had
nothing
more
transpired
,
your
*NL*
father
's
cause
had
been
gained
.
It
only
remained
to
put
it
to
the
vote
,
*NL*
when
the
president
resumed
:
`
Gentlemen
and
you
,
monsieur
,
--
you
will
*NL*
not
be
displeased
,
I
presume
,
to
listen
to
one
who
calls
himself
a
very
*NL*
important
witness
,
and
who
has
just
presented
himself
.
He
is
,
doubtless
,
*NL*
come
to
prove
the
perfect
innocence
of
our
colleague
.
Here
is
a
letter
*NL*
I
have
just
received
on
the
subject
;
shall
it
be
read
,
or
shall
it
*NL*
be
passed
over
?
and
shall
we
take
no
notice
of
this
incident
?
'
M.
de
*NL*
Morcerf
turned
pale
,
and
clinched
his
hands
on
the
papers
he
held
.
*NL*
The
committee
decided
to
hear
the
letter
;
the
count
was
thoughtful
and
*NL*
silent
.
The
president
read
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Mr.
President
,
--
I
can
furnish
the
committee

inquiry

Epirus

in

Macedonia
with
important
particulars

``
The
president
paused
,
and
the
count
turned
pale

The
president
looked
*NL*
at
his
auditors
.
`
Proceed

'
was
heard
on
all
sides
.
The
president
*NL*
resumed
:

''
'
I
was
on
the
spot
at
the
death

I
was
present

I
know
what

I
am
at
the

command

even

shall
be
in

`
And
who
is
this
witness
,
or
rather
this
enemy
?
'
asked
the
count
,
in
*NL*
a
tone
in
which
there
was
a
visible
alteration
.
`
We
shall
know
,
*NL*
sir
,
'
replied
the
president
.
`
Is
the
committee
willing
to
hear
this
*NL*
witness

'
--
`
Yes
,
yes

they
all
said
at
once

The
door-keeper
was

called

`
Is
there
any

the
lobby

said
the

*NL*
''
`
Yes

`
Who
is
it

A
woman

accompanied
by
a
servant

Every
*NL*
one
looked
at
his
neighbor

`
Bring
her
in
,
'
said
the
president
.
Five
*NL*
minutes
after
the
door-keeper
again
appeared
;
all
eyes
were
fixed
on
*NL*
the
door
,
and
I
,
''
said
Beauchamp
,
``
shared
the
general
expectation
and
*NL*
anxiety
.
Behind
the
door-keeper
walked
a
woman
enveloped
in
a
large
*NL*
veil
,
which
completely
concealed
her
.
It
was
evident
,
from
her
figure
*NL*
and
the
perfumes
she
had
about
her
,
that
she
was
young
and
fastidious
in
*NL*
her
tastes
,
but
that
was
all
.
The
president
requested
her
to
throw
*NL*
aside
her
veil
,
and
it
was
then
seen
that
she
was
dressed
in
the
Grecian
*NL*
costume
,
and
was
remarkably
beautiful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
said
Albert
,
``
it
was
she
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
?

*NL*
*NL*
``

``
Alas

it

go
on

Beauchamp

You
see
I

strong

yet
we
must

drawing
near
the

``
M.
de
Morcerf
,
''
continued
Beauchamp
,
``
looked
at
this
woman
with
*NL*
surprise
and
terror
.
Her
lips
were
about
to
pass
his
sentence
of
life
or
*NL*
death
.
To
the
committee
the
adventure
was
so
extraordinary
and
curious
,
*NL*
that
the
interest
they
had
felt
for
the
count
's
safety
became
now
quite
*NL*
a
secondary
matter

The
president
himself
advanced
to
place
a
seat
for

the
young
lady

she
declined
availing
herself
of
it

escaped

The

suffused
the

his

became
bloodshot

`
Sir

Haidee
,
*NL*
'
I
have
been
led
to
take
this
step
from
a
feeling
of
respect

grief

*NL*
Although
a
Christian
,
may
God
forgive
me
,
I
have
always
sought
to
*NL*
revenge
my
illustrious
father
.
Since
I
set
my
foot
in
France
,
and
knew
*NL*
the
traitor

in

I
have
watched
carefully

I
live
retired

in
the
house
of
my
noble
protector

I
do
it
from
choice
.
I
love
*NL*
retirement
and
silence
,
because
I
can
live
with
my
thoughts
and
*NL*
recollections
of
past
days

But
the
Count
of
Monte

surrounds
me
*NL*
with
every
paternal
care
,
and
I
am
ignorant
of
nothing
which
passes
in
*NL*
the
world

I
learn
all
in
the
silence
of
my
apartments
,
--
for
instance
,
I
*NL*
see
all
the
newspapers
,
every
periodical
,
as
well
as
every
new
piece
of
*NL*
music
;
and
by
thus
watching
the
course
of
the
life
of
others
,
I
learned
*NL*
what
had
transpired
this
morning
in
the
House
of
Peers
,
and
what
was
to
*NL*
take
place
this
evening

Then

one

doubtless
pitied
his

Each
word
fell
like
a
*NL*
dagger
on

deprived
him
of
a
portion
of
his
energy

as
she
*NL*
uttered
the
last

hid
his
mutilated
hand
hastily
in
his
bosom
,
and
*NL*
fell
back
on
his
seat
,
overwhelmed
by
wretchedness
and
despair

This
*NL*
scene
completely
changed
the
opinion

accused

at

terror

They
knew

energetic
and
violent
temper

must
*NL*
be
,
indeed
,
a
dreadful
blow
which
would
deprive
him
of
courage
to
defend

They
expected
that

stupefied
silence
would
be
followed
by

looked
around
him
with
an
expression

might
have
softened
tigers

which
could
not
disarm
his
judges

Then

he
raised
his

withdrew

immediately

Then
,
with
a
hasty
movement

he
tore
open
his
coat

seemed
to

stifle
him

and
flew
from

the
rattling
of

Contempt

my

How
does
this
misfortune
affect
you

No

happily

that
unjust

is
forgotten

made
the
son
responsible

actions

Review
your

Albert

although
it

only
just

greater
purity

has
marked
the
commencement

your
career

No
,
Albert
,
take
my
advice
.
*NL*
You
are
young
and
rich
--
leave
Paris
--
all
is
soon
forgotten
in
this
great
*NL*
Babylon
of
excitement
and
changing
tastes

You
will
return
after
three
*NL*
or
four
years
with
a
Russian
princess
for
a
bride
,
and
no
one
will
think
*NL*
more
of
what
occurred
yesterday
than
if
it
had
happened
sixteen
years
*NL*
ago

*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
my
dear
Beauchamp

thank
you
for
the
excellent
feeling
*NL*
which
prompts
your
advice
;

it
can
not
be
.
I
have
told
you
my
wish
,
or
*NL*
rather
my
determination

You
understand
that
,
interested
as
I
am
in
this
*NL*
affair

I
can
not
see
it
in
the
same
light

you
do

What
appears
to
you
*NL*
to
emanate
from
a
celestial
source
,
seems
to
me
to
proceed
from
one
far
*NL*
less
pure
.
Providence
appears
to
me
to
have
no
share
in
this
affair
;
and
*NL*
happily
so
,
for
instead
of
the
invisible
,
impalpable
agent
of
celestial
*NL*
rewards
and
punishments

I
shall
find
one
both
palpable

visible

whom
I
shall
revenge
myself

I
assure
you

for
all
I
have
suffered

during
the
last
month

Now

I
repeat

Beauchamp

I
wish
to
return
*NL*
to
human
and
material
existence
,

if
you
are
still
the
friend
you
*NL*
profess
to
be

help
me
to
discover
the
hand
that
struck
the
blow

*NL*
*NL*

Be

I

They
*NL*
sent
for
a
cabriolet
.
On
entering
the

they
perceived

the
phaeton
and
servant
of
M.
Andrea
Cavalcanti
.
``
Ah

with

``
If

I
will
kill
his
son-in-law

Cavalcanti

certainly
fight

*NL*
The
servant
announced
the
young
man
;
but
the
banker
,
recollecting
*NL*
what
had
transpired
the
day
before
,
did
not
wish
him
admitted
.
It
was
,
*NL*
however
,
too
late
;
Albert
had
followed
the
footman
,
and
,
hearing
the
*NL*
order
given
,
forced
the
door
open
,
and
followed
by
Beauchamp
found
*NL*
himself
in
the
banker
's
study
.
``
Sir
,
''
cried
the
latter
,
``
am
I
no
longer
*NL*
at
liberty

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

Albert
,
coldly
;

are
circumstances

can
not
,
except
through
cowardice

I
offer
you

*NL*
*NL*
``

is
your

*NL*
*NL*
``

Albert
,
drawing
near
,
and
without
apparently
noticing
*NL*
Cavalcanti
,
who
stood
with
his
back
towards
the
fireplace
--
``
I
mean
to
*NL*
propose
a
meeting
in
some
retired
corner
where
no
one
will
interrupt
us

ten
minutes
;
that
will
be
sufficient

where
two
men
having
met
,
one
*NL*
of
them
will
remain
on
the
ground

''
Danglars
turned
pale
;
Cavalcanti
*NL*
moved
a
step
forward
,
and
Albert
turned
towards
him
.
``
And
you
,
too

*NL*
said
he
,
``
come

if
you
like

almost
*NL*
one
of

I
will
give

many
rendezvous

I
*NL*
can
find
persons
willing

accept

Cavalcanti
looked
at
Danglars
*NL*
with
a
stupefied
air
,
and
the
latter
,
making
an
effort
,
arose
and
*NL*
stepped
between
the
two
young
men
.
Albert
's
attack
on
Andrea
had
placed
*NL*
him
on
a
different
footing
,
and
he
hoped
this
visit
had
another
cause
*NL*
than
that
he
had
at
first
supposed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
sir
,
''
said
he
to
Albert
,
``
if
you
are
come
to
quarrel
with
this
*NL*
gentleman
because
I
have
preferred
him
to
you

I
shall
resign
the
case
*NL*
to
the
king
's
attorney
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
mistake

sir

said
Morcerf
with
a
gloomy
smile
;
``
I
am
not
*NL*
referring
in
the
least
to
matrimony
,
and
I
only
addressed
myself
to
M.

Cavalcanti
because
he
appeared
disposed
to
interfere
between
us
.
In
one
*NL*
respect
you
are
right
,
for
I
am
ready
to
quarrel
with
every
one
to-day
;
*NL*
but
you
have
the
first
claim

M.
Danglars

''
*NL*
*NL*
``

replied
Danglars
,
pale
with
anger
and
fear
,
``
I
warn
you

the
misfortune

meet

mad
dog

far
from

thinking
myself
guilty
of
a
crime

believe

do
society
a
kindness

*NL*
Now
,
if
you
are
mad

try

bite
me

I
will
kill
you

it
my
fault

dishonored

*NL*
*NL*

Morcerf

Danglars

retreated
a
few
steps

he
;

must
be
mad

from

really

``
I
accuse

Yes

*NL*
Albert
felt
the
blood
mounting
to
his
brow

there
was
no

upon

Danglars
defended
himself
with

baseness

at

time
with
the
assurance
,
of
a
man
who
speaks
the
truth
,
at
least
*NL*
in
part
,
if
not
wholly
--
not
for
conscience
'
sake
,
but
through
fear
.
*NL*
Besides
,
what
was
Morcerf
seeking
?
It
was
not
whether
Danglars
or
Monte
*NL*
Cristo
was
more
or
less
guilty
;
it
was
a
man
who
would
answer
for
the
*NL*
offence
,
whether
trifling
or
serious
;
it
was
a
man
who
would
fight
,
*NL*
and
it
was
evident
Danglars
would
not
fight
.
And
,
in
addition
to
this
,
*NL*
everything
forgotten
or
unperceived
before
presented
itself
now
to
*NL*
his
recollection
.
Monte
Cristo
knew
everything
,
as
he
had
bought
the
*NL*
daughter
of
Ali
Pasha
;
and
,
knowing
everything
,
he
had
advised
Danglars
*NL*
to
write
to
Yanina
.
The
answer
known
,
he
had
yielded
to
Albert
's
wish
*NL*
to
be
introduced
to
Haidee
,
and
allowed
the
conversation
to
turn
on
*NL*
the
death
of
Ali
,
and
had
not
opposed
Haidee
's
recital
-LRB-
but
having
,
*NL*
doubtless
,
warned
the
young
girl
,
in
the
few
Romaic
words
he
spoke
to
*NL*
her
,
not
to
implicate
Morcerf
's
father
-RRB-
.
Besides
,
had
he
not
begged
of
*NL*
Morcerf
not
to
mention
his
father
's
name
before
Haidee
?
Lastly
,
he
had
*NL*
taken
Albert
to
Normandy
when
he
knew
the
final
blow
was
near
.
There
*NL*
could
be
no
doubt
that
all
had
been
calculated
and
previously
arranged
;
*NL*
Monte
Cristo
then
was
in
league
with
his
father
's
enemies
.
Albert
took
*NL*
Beauchamp
aside
,
and
communicated
these
ideas
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
right
,
''
said
the
latter
;
``
M.
Danglars
has
only
been
a
secondary
*NL*
agent
in
this
sad
affair
,
and
it
is
of
M.
de
Monte
Cristo
that
you
*NL*
must
demand
an
explanation
.
''
Albert
turned
.
``
Sir
,
''
said
he
to
Danglars
,
*NL*
``
understand
that
I
do
not
take
a
final
leave
of
you
;
I
must
ascertain
if
*NL*
your
insinuations
are
just
,
and
am
going
now
to
inquire
of
the
Count
*NL*
of
Monte
Cristo
.
''
He
bowed
to
the
banker
,
and
went
out
with
Beauchamp
,
*NL*
without
appearing
to
notice
Cavalcanti
.
Danglars
accompanied
him
to
the
*NL*
door
,
where
he
again
assured
Albert
that
no
motive
of
personal
hatred
*NL*
had
influenced
him
against
the
Count
of
Morcerf
.

*NL*
*NL*
At
the
banker
's
door
Beauchamp
stopped
Morcerf
.
``
Listen
,
''
said
he
;
*NL*
``
just
now
I
told
you
it
was
of
M.
de
Monte
Cristo
you
must
demand
an
*NL*
explanation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
and
we
are
going
to
his
house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Reflect
,
Morcerf
,
one
moment
before
you
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
what
shall
I
reflect
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
importance
of
the
step
you
are
taking
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
more
serious
than
going
to
M.
Danglars
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
M.
Danglars
is
a
money-lover
,
and
those
who
love
money
,
you
know
,
*NL*
think
too
much
of
what
they
risk
to
be
easily
induced
to
fight
a
duel
.
*NL*
The
other
is
,
on
the
contrary
,
to
all
appearance
a
true
nobleman
;
but
do
*NL*
you
not
fear
to
find
him
a
bully
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
only
fear
one
thing
;
namely
,
to
find
a
man
who
will
not
fight
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
not
be
alarmed
,
''
said
Beauchamp
;
``
he
will
meet
you
.
My
only
fear
is
*NL*
that
he
will
be
too
strong
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
friend
,
''
said
Morcerf
,
with
a
sweet
smile
,
``
that
is
what
I
wish
.
The
*NL*
happiest
thing
that
could
occur
to
me
,
would
be
to
die
in
my
father
's
*NL*
stead
;
that
would
save
us
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
mother
would
die
of
grief
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
poor
mother
!
''
said
Albert
,
passing
his
hand
across
his
eyes
,
``
I
know
*NL*
she
would
;
but
better
so
than
die
of
shame
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
quite
decided
,
Albert
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
let
us
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
do
you
think
we
shall
find
the
count
at
home
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
intended
returning
some
hours
after
me
,
and
doubtless
he
is
now
at
*NL*
home
.
''
They
ordered
the
driver
to
take
them
to
No.
30
Champs-Elysees
.
*NL*
Beauchamp
wished
to
go
in
alone
,
but
Albert
observed
that
as
this
was
*NL*
an
unusual
circumstance
he
might
be
allowed
to
deviate
from
the
usual
*NL*
etiquette
in
affairs
of
honor
.
The
cause
which
the
young
man
espoused
*NL*
was
one
so
sacred
that
Beauchamp
had
only
to
comply
with
all
his
wishes
;
*NL*
he
yielded
and
contented
himself
with
following
Morcerf
.
Albert
sprang
*NL*
from
the
porter
's
lodge
to
the
steps
.
He
was
received
by
Baptistin
.
*NL*
The
count
had
,
indeed
,
just
arrived
,
but
he
was
in
his
bath
,
and
had
*NL*
forbidden
that
any
one
should
be
admitted
.
``
But
after
his
bath
?
''
asked
*NL*
Morcerf
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
master
will
go
to
dinner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
after
dinner
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
will
sleep
an
hour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
going
to
the
opera
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
sure
of
it
?
''
asked
Albert
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
,
sir
;
my
master
has
ordered
his
horses
at
eight
o'clock
*NL*
precisely
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
good
,
''
replied
Albert
;
``
that
is
all
I
wished
to
know
.
''
Then
,
*NL*
turning
towards
Beauchamp
,
``
If
you
have
anything
to
attend
to
,
*NL*
Beauchamp
,
do
it
directly
;
if
you
have
any
appointment
for
this
evening
,
*NL*
defer
it
till
tomorrow
.
I
depend
on
you
to
accompany
me
to
the
opera
;
*NL*
and
if
you
can
,
bring
Chateau-Renaud
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Beauchamp
availed
himself
of
Albert
's
permission
,
and
left
him
,
*NL*
promising
to
call
for
him
at
a
quarter
before
eight
.
On
his
return
home
,
*NL*
Albert
expressed
his
wish
to
Franz
Debray
,
and
Morrel
,
to
see
them
at
*NL*
the
opera
that
evening
.
Then
he
went
to
see
his
mother
,
who
since
the
*NL*
events
of
the
day
before
had
refused
to
see
any
one
,
and
had
kept
*NL*
her
room
.
He
found
her
in
bed
,
overwhelmed
with
grief
at
this
public
*NL*
humiliation
.
The
sight
of
Albert
produced
the
effect
which
might
*NL*
naturally
be
expected
on
Mercedes
;
she
pressed
her
son
's
hand
and
sobbed
*NL*
aloud
,
but
her
tears
relieved
her
.
Albert
stood
one
moment
speechless
by
*NL*
the
side
of
his
mother
's
bed
.
It
was
evident
from
his
pale
face
and
knit
*NL*
brows
that
his
resolution
to
revenge
himself
was
growing
weaker
.
``
My
*NL*
dear
mother
,
''
said
he
,
``
do
you
know
if
M.
de
Morcerf
has
any
enemy
?
''
*NL*
Mercedes
started
;
she
noticed
that
the
young
man
did
not
say
``
my
*NL*
father
.
''
``
My
son
,
''
she
said
,
``
persons
in
the
count
's
situation
have
many
*NL*
secret
enemies
.
Those
who
are
known
are
not
the
most
dangerous
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
it
,
and
appeal
to
your
penetration
.
You
are
of
so
superior
a
*NL*
mind
,
nothing
escapes
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
you
say
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
,
for
instance
,
you
noticed
on
the
evening
of
the
ball
we
gave
,
*NL*
that
M.
de
Monte
Cristo
would
eat
nothing
in
our
house
.
''
Mercedes
raised
*NL*
herself
on
her
feverish
arm
.
``
M.
de
Monte
Cristo
!
''
she
exclaimed
;
``
and
*NL*
how
is
he
connected
with
the
question
you
asked
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
,
mother
,
M.
de
Monte
Cristo
is
almost
an
Oriental
,
and
it
is
*NL*
customary
with
the
Orientals
to
secure
full
liberty
for
revenge
by
not
*NL*
eating
or
drinking
in
the
houses
of
their
enemies
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
say
M.
de
Monte
Cristo
is
our
enemy
?
''
replied
Mercedes
,
becoming
*NL*
paler
than
the
sheet
which
covered
her
.
``
Who
told
you
so
?
Why
,
you
are
*NL*
mad
,
Albert
!
M.
de
Monte
Cristo
has
only
shown
us
kindness
.
M.
de
Monte
*NL*
Cristo
saved
your
life
;
you
yourself
presented
him
to
us
.
Oh
,
I
entreat
*NL*
you
,
my
son
,
if
you
had
entertained
such
an
idea
,
dispel
it
;
and
my
*NL*
counsel
to
you
--
nay
,
my
prayer
--
is
to
retain
his
friendship
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mother
,
''
replied
the
young
man
,
``
you
have
especial
reasons
for
telling
*NL*
me
to
conciliate
that
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
?
''
said
Mercedes
,
blushing
as
rapidly
as
she
had
turned
pale
,
and
*NL*
again
becoming
paler
than
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
doubtless
;
and
is
it
not
that
he
may
never
do
us
any
harm
?
''
*NL*
Mercedes
shuddered
,
and
,
fixing
on
her
son
a
scrutinizing
gaze
,
``
You
*NL*
speak
strangely
,
''
said
she
to
Albert
,
``
and
you
appear
to
have
some
*NL*
singular
prejudices
.
What
has
the
count
done
?
Three
days
since
you
were
*NL*
with
him
in
Normandy
;
only
three
days
since
we
looked
on
him
as
our
best
*NL*
friend
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
An
ironical
smile
passed
over
Albert
's
lips
.
Mercedes
saw
it
and
with
*NL*
the
double
instinct
of
woman
and
mother
guessed
all
;
but
as
she
was
*NL*
prudent
and
strong-minded
she
concealed
both
her
sorrows
and
her
fears
.
*NL*
Albert
was
silent
;
an
instant
after
,
the
countess
resumed
:
``
You
came
to
*NL*
inquire
after
my
health
;
I
will
candidly
acknowledge
that
I
am
not
well
.
*NL*
You
should
install
yourself
here
,
and
cheer
my
solitude
.
I
do
not
wish
*NL*
to
be
left
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mother
,
''
said
the
young
man
,
``
you
know
how
gladly
I
would
obey
your
*NL*
wish
,
but
an
urgent
and
important
affair
obliges
me
to
leave
you
for
the
*NL*
whole
evening
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
replied
Mercedes
,
sighing
,
``
go
,
Albert
;
I
will
not
make
you
a
*NL*
slave
to
your
filial
piety
.
''
Albert
pretended
he
did
not
hear
,
bowed
*NL*
to
his
mother
,
and
quitted
her
.
Scarcely
had
he
shut
her
door
,
when
*NL*
Mercedes
called
a
confidential
servant
,
and
ordered
him
to
follow
Albert
*NL*
wherever
he
should
go
that
evening
,
and
to
come
and
tell
her
immediately
*NL*
what
he
observed
.
Then
she
rang
for
her
lady
's
maid
,
and
,
weak
as
she
*NL*
was
,
she
dressed
,
in
order
to
be
ready
for
whatever
might
happen
.
The
*NL*
footman
's
mission
was
an
easy
one
.
Albert
went
to
his
room
,
and
dressed
*NL*
with
unusual
care
.
At
ten
minutes
to
eight
Beauchamp
arrived
;
he
had
*NL*
seen
Chateau-Renaud
,
who
had
promised
to
be
in
the
orchestra
before
the
*NL*
curtain
was
raised
.
Both
got
into
Albert
's
coupe
;
and
,
as
the
young
man
*NL*
had
no
reason
to
conceal
where
he
was
going
,
he
called
aloud
,
``
To
*NL*
the
opera
.
''
In
his
impatience
he
arrived
before
the
beginning
of
the
*NL*
performance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Chateau-Renaud
was
at
his
post
;
apprised
by
Beauchamp
of
the
*NL*
circumstances
,
he
required
no
explanation
from
Albert
.
The
conduct
*NL*
of
the
son
in
seeking
to
avenge
his
father
was
so
natural
that
*NL*
Chateau-Renaud
did
not
seek
to
dissuade
him
,
and
was
content
with
*NL*
renewing
his
assurances
of
devotion
.
Debray
was
not
yet
come
,
but
Albert
*NL*
knew
that
he
seldom
lost
a
scene
at
the
opera
.
Albert
wandered
about
*NL*
the
theatre
until
the
curtain
was
drawn
up
.
He
hoped
to
meet
with
M.
de
*NL*
Monte
Cristo
either
in
the
lobby
or
on
the
stairs
.
The
bell
summoned
*NL*
him
to
his
seat
,
and
he
entered
the
orchestra
with
Chateau-Renaud
and
*NL*
Beauchamp
.
But
his
eyes
scarcely
quitted
the
box
between
the
columns
,
*NL*
which
remained
obstinately
closed
during
the
whole
of
the
first
act
.
At
*NL*
last
,
as
Albert
was
looking
at
his
watch
for
about
the
hundredth
time
,
*NL*
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
act
the
door
opened
,
and
Monte
Cristo
*NL*
entered
,
dressed
in
black
,
and
,
leaning
over
the
front
of
the
box
,
*NL*
looked
around
the
pit
.
Morrel
followed
him
,
and
looked
also
for
his
*NL*
sister
and
brother
in-law
;
he
soon
discovered
them
in
another
box
,
and
*NL*
kissed
his
hand
to
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
count
,
in
his
survey
of
the
pit
,
encountered
a
pale
face
and
*NL*
threatening
eyes
,
which
evidently
sought
to
gain
his
attention
.
He
*NL*
recognized
Albert
,
but
thought
it
better
not
to
notice
him
,
as
he
looked
*NL*
so
angry
and
discomposed
.
Without
communicating
his
thoughts
to
his
*NL*
companion
,
he
sat
down
,
drew
out
his
opera-glass
,
and
looked
another
*NL*
way
.
Although
apparently
not
noticing
Albert
,
he
did
not
,
however
,
lose
*NL*
sight
of
him
,
and
when
the
curtain
fell
at
the
end
of
the
second
act
,
he
*NL*
saw
him
leave
the
orchestra
with
his
two
friends
.
Then
his
head
was
*NL*
seen
passing
at
the
back
of
the
boxes
,
and
the
count
knew
that
the
*NL*
approaching
storm
was
intended
to
fall
on
him
.
He
was
at
the
moment
*NL*
conversing
cheerfully
with
Morrel
,
but
he
was
well
prepared
for
what
*NL*
might
happen
.
The
door
opened
,
and
Monte
Cristo
,
turning
round
,
saw
*NL*
Albert
,
pale
and
trembling
,
followed
by
Beauchamp
and
Chateau-Renaud
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
cried
he
,
with
that
benevolent
politeness
which
distinguished
*NL*
his
salutation
from
the
common
civilities
of
the
world
,
``
my
cavalier
has
*NL*
attained
his
object
.
Good-evening
,
M.
de
Morcerf
.
''
The
countenance
of
*NL*
this
man
,
who
possessed
such
extraordinary
control
over
his
feelings
,
*NL*
expressed
the
most
perfect
cordiality
.
Morrel
only
then
recollected
the
*NL*
letter
he
had
received
from
the
viscount
,
in
which
,
without
assigning
*NL*
any
reason
,
he
begged
him
to
go
to
the
opera
,
but
he
understood
that
*NL*
something
terrible
was
brooding
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
not
come
here
,
sir
,
to
exchange
hypocritical
expressions
of
*NL*
politeness
,
or
false
professions
of
friendship
,
''
said
Albert
,
``
but
to
*NL*
demand
an
explanation
.
''
The
young
man
's
trembling
voice
was
scarcely
*NL*
audible
.
``
An
explanation
at
the
opera
?
''
said
the
count
,
with
that
calm
*NL*
tone
and
penetrating
eye
which
characterize
the
man
who
knows
his
cause
*NL*
is
good
.
``
Little
acquainted
as
I
am
with
the
habits
of
Parisians
,
I
*NL*
should
not
have
thought
this
the
place
for
such
a
demand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Still
,
if
people
will
shut
themselves
up
,
''
said
Albert
,
``
and
can
not
*NL*
be
seen
because
they
are
bathing
,
dining
,
or
asleep
,
we
must
avail
*NL*
ourselves
of
the
opportunity
whenever
they
are
to
be
seen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
difficult
of
access
,
sir
;
for
yesterday
,
if
my
memory
does
not
*NL*
deceive
me
,
you
were
at
my
house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yesterday
I
was
at
your
house
,
sir
,
''
said
the
young
man
;
``
because
then
*NL*
I
knew
not
who
you
were
.
''
In
pronouncing
these
words
Albert
had
raised
*NL*
his
voice
so
as
to
be
heard
by
those
in
the
adjoining
boxes
and
in
the
*NL*
lobby
.
Thus
the
attention
of
many
was
attracted
by
this
altercation
.
*NL*
``
Where
are
you
come
from
,
sir
?
You
do
not
appear
to
be
in
the
possession
*NL*
of
your
senses
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Provided
I
understand
your
perfidy

making
you

I
will
be
revenged
,
I
shall
be
reasonable
enough

said
*NL*
Albert
furiously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
understand
you
,
sir
,
''
replied
Monte
Cristo
;
``
and
if
I
did
,
*NL*
your
tone
is
too
high
.
I
am
at
home
here
,
and
I
alone
have
a
right
*NL*
to
raise
my
voice
above
another
's
.
Leave
the
box
,
sir
!
''
Monte
Cristo
*NL*
pointed
towards
the
door
with
the
most
commanding
dignity
.
``
Ah
,
I
shall
*NL*
know
how
to
make
you
leave
your
home
!
''
replied
Albert
,
clasping
in
his
*NL*
convulsed
grasp
the
glove
,
which
Monte
Cristo
did
not
lose
sight
of
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
well
,
''
said
Monte
Cristo
quietly
,
``
I
see
you
wish
to
quarrel
with
*NL*
me
;
but
I
would
give
you
one
piece
of
advice
,
which
you
will
do
well
*NL*
to
keep
in
mind
.
It
is
in
poor
taste
to
make
a
display
of
a
challenge
.
*NL*
Display
is
not
becoming
to
every
one
,
M.
de
Morcerf

''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
name
a
murmur
of
astonishment
passed
around
the
group
of
*NL*
spectators
of
this
scene
.
They
had
talked
of
no
one
but
Morcerf
the
*NL*
whole
day
.
Albert
understood
the
allusion
in
a
moment
,
and
was
about
*NL*
to
throw
his
glove
at
the
count
,
when
Morrel
seized
his
hand
,
while
*NL*
Beauchamp
and
Chateau-Renaud
,
fearing
the
scene
would
surpass
the
limits
*NL*
of
a
challenge
,
held
him
back
.
But
Monte
Cristo
,
without
rising
,
and
*NL*
leaning
forward
in
his
chair
,
merely
stretched
out
his
arm
and
,
taking
*NL*
the
damp
,
crushed
glove
from
the
clinched
hand
of
the
young
man
,
``
Sir
,
''
*NL*
said
he
in
a
solemn
tone
,
``
I
consider
your
glove
thrown
,
and
will
return
*NL*
it
to
you
wrapped
around
a
bullet
.
Now
leave
me
or
I
will
summon
my
*NL*
servants
to
throw
you
out
at
the
door
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Wild
,
almost
unconscious
,
and
with
eyes
inflamed
,
Albert
stepped
back
,
*NL*
and
Morrel
closed
the
door
.
Monte
Cristo
took
up
his
glass
again
as
if
*NL*
nothing
had
happened
;
his
face
was
like
marble
,
and
his
heart
was
like
*NL*
bronze
.
Morrel
whispered
,
``
What
have
you
done
to
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
?
Nothing
--
at
least
personally
,
''
said
Monte
Cristo
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
there
must
be
some
cause
for
this
strange
scene

*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Count
of
Morcerf
's
adventure
exasperates
the
young

*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
anything
to
do
with
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
through
Haidee
that
the
Chamber
was
informed
of
his
father
's
*NL*
treason
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
?
''
said
Morrel
.
``
I
had
been
told
,
but
would
not
credit
it
,
that
*NL*
the
Grecian
slave
I
have
seen
with
you
here
in
this
very
box
was
the
*NL*
daughter
of
Ali

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
true

*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
''
said
Morrel
,
``
I
understand
it

this

premeditated

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

Albert
wrote
to
request
me
to
come
to
the
opera
,
doubtless
that
I
*NL*
might
be
a
witness
to
the
insult
he
meant
to
offer
you

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Probably

said
Monte

with
his
imperturbable
tranquillity

*NL*

''
*NL*
Morrel
,
in
his
turn
,
took
Monte
Cristo
's
hand
in
both
of
his
,
and
he
*NL*
shuddered
to
feel
how
cold
and
steady
it
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

said
he
,
``

father
loves
him
so
much

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
not

to
me
of

said
Monte

,
with
the
first
movement
*NL*
of
anger
he
had
betrayed
;
``
I
will
make

suffer

Morrel
,
amazed
,
let

fall
Monte

's
hand
.
``

said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
Maximilian

interrupted
the
count
,
``

adorably
Duprez

Morrel
saw
it
was
useless
to
say
more
,
and
*NL*
refrained
.
The
curtain
,
which
had
risen
at
the
close
of
the
scene
with
*NL*
Albert
,
again
fell
,
and
a
rap
was
heard
at
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
in
,
''
said
Monte
Cristo
with
a
voice
that
betrayed
not
the
*NL*
least
emotion
;
and
immediately
Beauchamp
appeared
.
``
Good-evening
,
M.
*NL*
Beauchamp
,
''
said
Monte
Cristo
,
as
if
this
was
the
first
time
he
had
seen
*NL*
the
journalist
that
evening
;
``
be
seated

''
*NL*
*NL*
Beauchamp
bowed
,
and
,
sitting
down
,
``
Sir

said
he
,
``
I
just
now

accompanied

*NL*

replied
Monte

laughing

``

just
dined
together

done
so

entirely
on

add

some

explanation

two
words

Monte

motioned
him
to
be

silent

he

laughing
,
``
there
are
all
my

destroyed

*NL*
``
How
so

asked
Beauchamp

*NL*

,
renewing
his
promise
to
be
with
him
the
next
*NL*
morning
at
seven
o'clock
,
and
to
bring
Emmanuel
.
Then
he
stepped
into
*NL*
his
coupe
,
calm
and
smiling
,
and
was
at
home
in
five
minutes
.
No
one
who
*NL*
knew
the
count
could
mistake
his
expression
when
,
on
entering
,
he
said
,
*NL*
``
Ali
,
bring
me
my
pistols
with
the
ivory
cross
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ali
brought
the
box
to
his
master
,
who
examined
the
weapons
with
a
*NL*
solicitude
very
natural
to
a
man
who
is
about
to
intrust
his
life
to
a
*NL*
little
powder
and
shot
.
These
were
pistols
of
an
especial
pattern
,
which
*NL*
Monte
Cristo
had
had
made
for
target
practice
in
his
own
room
.
A
cap
was
*NL*
sufficient
to
drive
out
the
bullet
,
and
from
the
adjoining
room
no
one
*NL*
would
have
suspected
that
the
count
was
,
as
sportsmen
would
say
,
keeping
*NL*
his
hand
in
.
He
was
just
taking
one
up
and
looking
for
the
point
to
aim
*NL*
at
on
a
little
iron
plate
which
served
him
as
a
target
,
when
his
study
*NL*
door
opened
,
and
Baptistin
entered
.
Before
he
had
spoken
a
word
,
the
*NL*
count
saw
in
the
next
room
a
veiled
woman
,
who
had
followed
closely
*NL*
after
Baptistin
,
and
now
,
seeing
the
count
with
a
pistol
in
his
hand
and
*NL*
swords
on
the
table
,
rushed
in
.
Baptistin
looked
at
his
master
,
who
made
*NL*
a
sign
to
him
,
and
he
went
out
,
closing
the
door
after
him
.
``
Who
are
*NL*
you
,
madame
?
''
said
the
count
to
the
veiled
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
stranger
cast
one
look
around
her
,
to
be
certain
that
they
were
*NL*
quite
alone
;
then
bending
as
if
she
would
have
knelt
,
and
joining
her
*NL*
hands
,
she
said
with
an
accent
of
despair
,
``
Edmond
,
you
will
not
kill
my
*NL*
son
?
''
The
count
retreated
a
step
,
uttered
a
slight
exclamation
,
and
let
*NL*
fall
the
pistol
he
held
.
``
What
name
did
you
pronounce
then
,
Madame
de
*NL*
Morcerf
?
''
said
he
.
``
Yours
!
''
cried
she
,
throwing
back
her
veil
,
--
``
yours
,
*NL*
which
I
alone
,
perhaps
,
have
not
forgotten
.
Edmond
,
it
is
not
Madame
de
*NL*
Morcerf
who
is
come
to
you
,
it
is
Mercedes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mercedes
is
dead
,
madame
,
''
said
Monte
Cristo
;
``
I
know
no
one
now
of
*NL*
that
name
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mercedes
lives
,
sir
,
and
she
remembers
,
for
she
alone
recognized
*NL*
you
when
she
saw
you

and
even
before
she
saw
you
,
by
your
voice
,
*NL*
Edmond
,
--
by
the
simple
sound
of
your
voice
;
and
from
that
moment
she
*NL*
has
followed
your
steps
,
watched
you
,
feared
you
,
and
she
needs
not
to
*NL*
inquire
what
hand
has
dealt
the
blow
which
now
strikes
M.
de
Morcerf
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fernand
,
do
you
mean
?
''
replied
Monte
Cristo
,
with
bitter
irony
;
``
since
*NL*
we
are
recalling
names
,
let
us
remember
them
all

''
Monte
Cristo
had
*NL*
pronounced
the
name
of
Fernand
with
such
an
expression
of
hatred
that
*NL*
Mercedes
felt
a
thrill
of
horror
run
through
every
vein
.
``
You
see
,
*NL*
Edmond
,
I
am
not
mistaken
,
and
have
cause
to
say
,

Spare

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
who
told
you

I

any
hostile
intentions

*NL*
*NL*
``
No
one

in
truth

this
evening

*NL*
``

said
Monte

with
awful
calmness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

for
pity
's
sake

*NL*
*NL*
``
You

him

*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen

*NL*
``

I
was
arrested

became
a
prisoner
because
,
*NL*
under
the
arbor
of
La
Reserve
,
the
day
before
I
was
to
marry
you
,
a
man
*NL*
named
Danglars
wrote
this
letter
,
which
the
fisherman
Fernand
himself
*NL*
posted
.
''
Monte
Cristo
went
to
a
secretary
,
opened
a
drawer
by
a
spring
,
*NL*
from
which
he
took
a
paper
which
had
lost
its
original
color
,
and
the
*NL*
ink
of
which
had
become
of
a
rusty
hue
--
this
he
placed
in
the
hands
*NL*
of
Mercedes
.
It
was
Danglars
'
letter
to
the
king
's
attorney
,
which
the
*NL*
Count
of
Monte
Cristo
,
disguised
as
a
clerk
from
the
house
of
Thomson
&
*NL*
French
,
had
taken
from
the
file
against
Edmond
Dantes
,
on
the
day
he
*NL*
had
paid
the
two
hundred
thousand
francs
to
M.
de
Boville
.
Mercedes
read
*NL*
with
terror
the
following
lines
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
king
's
attorney
is
informed
by
a
friend
to
the
throne
and
religion
*NL*
that
one
Edmond
Dantes
,
second
in
command
on
board
the
Pharaon
,
this
day
*NL*
arrived
from
Smyrna
,
after
having
touched
at
Naples
and
Porto-Ferrajo
,
*NL*
is
the
bearer
of
a
letter
from
Murat
to
the
usurper
,
and
of
another
*NL*
letter
from
the
usurper
to
the
Bonapartist
club
in
Paris
.
Ample
*NL*
corroboration
of
this
statement
may
be
obtained
by
arresting
the
*NL*
above-mentioned
Edmond
Dantes
,
who
either
carries
the
letter
for
Paris
*NL*
about
with
him
,
or
has
it
at
his
father
's
abode
.
Should
it
not
be
*NL*
found
in
possession
of
either
father
or
son
,
then
it
will
assuredly
*NL*
be
discovered
in
the
cabin
belonging
to
the
said
Dantes
on
board
the
*NL*
Pharaon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
dreadful
!
''
said
Mercedes
,
passing
her
hand
across
her
brow
,
moist
*NL*
with
perspiration
;
``
and
that
letter
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
bought
it
for
two
hundred
thousand
francs
,
madame
,
''
said
Monte
*NL*
Cristo
;
``
but
that
is
a
trifle

since
it
enables
me
to
justify
myself
to
*NL*
you
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
the
result
of
that
letter
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
well
know
,
madame

was
my
arrest

you
do

long
that

lasted

You

I
remained
for
fourteen
years
within
*NL*
a
quarter
of
a
league
of
you

in
a
dungeon
in
the
Chateau
d'If

You
do
*NL*
not
know
that
every
day
of
those
fourteen
years
I
renewed
the
vow
of
*NL*
vengeance
which
I
had
made
the
first
day
;
and
yet
I
was
not
aware
that
*NL*
you

my
calumniator

that
my

had
died
of

hunger

it

?

cried
Mercedes
,
shuddering
.

is
what
I
heard
on
leaving
my
prison
fourteen
years
after
I
had
*NL*
entered
it
;
and
that
is
why
,
on
account
of
the
living
Mercedes
and
my
*NL*
deceased
father
,
I
have
sworn
to
revenge
myself
on
Fernand
,
and
--
I
have
*NL*
revenged
myself
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
are
sure
the
unhappy
Fernand
did
that
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
satisfied
,
madame
,
that
he
did
what
I
have
told
you
;
besides
,
that
*NL*
is
not
much
more
odious
than
that
a
Frenchman
by
adoption
should
pass
*NL*
over
to
the
English
;
that
a
Spaniard
by
birth
should
have
fought
against

the
Spaniards

that
a

should
have
betrayed

murdered

Compared
with
such
things

what
is
the
letter
you
have

just
read

a
lover
's
deception
,
which
the
woman
who
has
married
that
*NL*
man
ought
certainly
to
forgive
;

not
so
the
lover
who
was
to
have

married
her

Well
,
the
French
did
not
avenge
themselves
on

traitor

*NL*
the
Spaniards
did
not
shoot

traitor

tomb

betrayed

sacrificed

risen
from

my
tomb

by
the
grace
of
God
,
to
punish
that
man

He
sends
me
for
that
*NL*
purpose

here
I
am

The
poor
woman
's
head
and
arms
fell
;
her
legs
*NL*
bent
under
her
,

she
fell
on
her
knees

``
Forgive

forgive

The
dignity

checked
the
fervor

Her
forehead
almost
touched
the
carpet

when
the
count
sprang
forward
*NL*

raised
her
.
Then
seated
on
a
chair

she
looked
at
the
manly
*NL*
countenance
of
Monte

,
on
which
grief
and
hatred
still
impressed
*NL*
a
threatening
expression

``
Not

Impossible

The

fearing
to
yield
to
the
entreaties
of
her
he
had
so
ardently

loved

called
his
sufferings
to
the
assistance

upon
the
rocks
first
revealed
to
your
jailers
that
*NL*
they
were
your
murderers

Well
,
Edmond
,
I
swear
to
you
,
by
the
head
*NL*
of
that
son
for
whom
I
entreat
your
pity
,
--
Edmond
,
for
ten
years
I
saw
*NL*
every
night
every
detail
of
that
frightful
tragedy
,
and
for
ten
years
*NL*
I
heard
every
night
the
cry
which
awoke
me
,
shuddering
and
cold
.
And
*NL*
I
,
too
,
Edmond
--
oh
!
believe
me
--
guilty
as
I
was
--
oh
,
yes
,
I
,
too
,
have
*NL*
suffered
much
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
known
what
it
is
to
have
your
father
starve
to
death
in
your
*NL*
absence
?
''
cried
Monte
Cristo
,
thrusting
his
hands
into
his
hair
;
``
have
*NL*
you
seen
the
woman
you
loved
giving
her
hand
to
your
rival
,
while
you
*NL*
were
perishing
at
the
bottom
of
a
dungeon
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
interrupted
Mercedes
,
``
but
I
have
seen
him
whom
I
loved
on
the
*NL*
point
of
murdering
my
son
.
''
Mercedes
uttered
these
words
with
such
deep
*NL*
anguish
,
with
an
accent
of
such
intense
despair
,
that
Monte
Cristo
could
*NL*
not
restrain
a
sob
.
The
lion
was
daunted
;
the
avenger
was
conquered
.
*NL*
``
What
do
you
ask
of
me
?
''
said
he
,
--
``
your
son
's
life
?
Well
,
he
shall
*NL*
live
!
''
Mercedes
uttered
a
cry
which
made
the
tears
start
from
Monte
*NL*
Cristo
's
eyes
;
but
these
tears
disappeared
almost
instantaneously
,
for
,
*NL*
doubtless
,
God
had
sent
some
angel
to
collect
them
--
far
more
precious
*NL*
were
they
in
his
eyes
than
the
richest
pearls
of
Guzerat
and
Ophir
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

''
said
she
,
seizing
the
count

hand
and
raising
it
to
her
lips
;
*NL*
``

thank

Now
you
are
exactly

I
dreamt

I
always
loved

Oh

now
I
may
say
so
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
much
the
better

''
replied
Monte
Cristo
;
``
as
that
poor
Edmond

*NL*
not

long

Death

``
Die

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do

whole

myself

Mercedes
shrieked
,
and
sprang
towards
Monte

,
suddenly
*NL*
stopping
,
``
Edmond

said
she
,
``
there

While

waiting
his

I
trust

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

said
Monte
Cristo
,
surprised
that
without
*NL*
more
emotion
Mercedes
had
accepted
the
heroic
sacrifice
he
made
for
her
.
*NL*
Mercedes
extended
her
hand
to
the
count
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Edmond

said
she
,
and
her
eyes
were
wet
with
tears
while
looking
at
*NL*
him
to
whom
she
spoke
,
``
how
noble
it
is
of
you

how
great
the
action
you
*NL*

just
performed

how
sublime

have
taken
pity
on
a
poor
woman
who
*NL*
appealed
to
you
with
every
chance
against
her
,
Alas
,
I
am
grown
old
with
*NL*
grief
more
than
with
years
,
and
can
not
now
remind
my
Edmond
by
a
smile
,
*NL*
or
by
a
look
,
of
that
Mercedes
whom
he
once
spent
so
many
hours
in
*NL*
contemplating
.
Ah
,
believe
me
,
Edmond

as
I
told
you

I
too
have
*NL*
suffered
much
;
I
repeat

it
is
melancholy
to
pass
one

without
*NL*
having
one
joy
to
recall

without
preserving
a

hope

No

remains

Oh

I
repeat
it

Edmond

what
you

beautiful

grand

sublime

``
Do
you

then
what
would
you
say
if
you
knew
the
*NL*
extent

the
sacrifice
I
make
to
you
?
Suppose
that
the
Supreme
Being
,
*NL*
after
having
created
the
world
and
fertilized
chaos
,
had
paused
in
the
*NL*
work
to
spare
an
angel
the
tears
that
might
one
day
flow
for
mortal
sins
*NL*
from
her
immortal
eyes

suppose
that
when
everything
was
in
readiness
*NL*
and
the
moment
had
come
for
God
to
look
upon
his
work
and
see
that
it
*NL*
was
good

suppose
he
had
snuffed
out
the
sun
and
tossed
the
world
back
*NL*
into
eternal
night
--
then
--
even
then

Mercedes

you
could
not
imagine
*NL*
what
I
lose
in
sacrificing
my
life
at
this
moment

''
Mercedes
looked
at
*NL*
the
count
in
a
way
which
expressed
at
the
same
time
her
astonishment
,
*NL*
her
admiration
,
and
her
gratitude
.
Monte
Cristo
pressed
his
forehead
on
*NL*
his
burning
hands
,
as
if
his
brain
could
no
longer
bear
alone
the
weight
*NL*
of
its
thoughts
.
``
Edmond
,
''
said
Mercedes
,
``
I
have
but
one
word
more
to
*NL*
say
to
you
.
''
The
count
smiled
bitterly
.
``
Edmond
,
''
continued
she
,
``
you
*NL*
will
see
that
if
my
face
is
pale
,
if
my
eyes
are
dull
,
if
my
beauty
is
*NL*
gone
;
if
Mercedes
,
in
short
,
no
longer
resembles
her
former
self
in
her
*NL*
features
,
you
will
see
that
her
heart
is
still
the
same
.
Adieu
,
then
,
*NL*
Edmond
;
I
have
nothing
more
to
ask
of
heaven
--
I
have
seen
you
again
,
*NL*
and
have
found
you
as
noble
and
as
great
as
formerly
you
were
.
Adieu
,
*NL*
Edmond
,
adieu
,
and
thank
you

''
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
count
did
not
answer
.
Mercedes
opened
the
door
of
the
study
and
*NL*
had
disappeared
before
he
had
recovered
from
the
painful
and
profound
*NL*
revery
into
which
his
thwarted
vengeance
had
plunged
him
.
The
clock
*NL*
of
the
Invalides
struck
one
when
the
carriage
which
conveyed
Madame
*NL*
de
Morcerf
away
rolled
on
the
pavement
of
the
Champs-Elysees
,
and
made
*NL*
Monte
Cristo
raise
his
head
.
``
What
a
fool
I
was
,
''
said
he
,
``
not

The
Meeting
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
Mercedes
had
left
Monte
Cristo
,
he
fell
into
profound
gloom
.
*NL*
Around
him
and
within
him
the
flight
of
thought
seemed
to
have
stopped
;
*NL*
his
energetic
mind
slumbered
,
as
the
body
does
after
extreme
fatigue
.
*NL*
``
What
?
''
said
he
to
himself
,
while
the
lamp
and
the
wax
lights
were
*NL*
nearly
burnt
out
,
and
the
servants
were
waiting
impatiently
in
the
*NL*
anteroom
;
``
what
?
this
edifice
which
I
have
been
so
long
preparing
,
which
*NL*
I
have
reared
with
so
much
care
and
toil
,
is
to
be
crushed
by
a
single
*NL*
touch
,
a
word
,
a
breath
!
Yes
,
this
self
,
of
whom
I
thought
so
much
,
of
*NL*
whom
I
was
so
proud
,
who
had
appeared
so
worthless
in
the
dungeons
of
*NL*
the
Chateau
d'If
,
and
whom
I
had
succeeded
in
making
so
great
,
will
be
*NL*
but
a
lump
of
clay
to-morrow
.
Alas
,
it
is
not
the
death
of
the
body
I
*NL*
regret
;
for
is
not
the
destruction
of
the
vital
principle
,
the
repose
to
*NL*
which
everything
is
tending
,
to
which
every
unhappy
being
aspires
,
--
is
*NL*
not
this
the
repose
of
matter
after
which
I
so
long
sighed
,
and
which
*NL*
I
was
seeking
to
attain
by
the
painful
process
of
starvation
when
Faria
*NL*
appeared
in
my
dungeon
?
What
is
death
for
me
?
One
step
farther
into
*NL*
rest
,
--
two
,
perhaps
,
into
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
it
is
not
existence
,
then
,
that
I
regret
,
but
the
ruin
of
projects
*NL*
so
slowly
carried
out
,
so
laboriously
framed
.
Providence
is
now
opposed
*NL*
to
them
,
when
I
most
thought
it
would
be
propitious
.
It
is
not
God
's
*NL*
will
that
they
should
be
accomplished
.
This
burden
,
almost
as
heavy
as
a
*NL*
world
,
which
I
had
raised
,
and
I
had
thought
to
bear
to
the
end
,
was
too
*NL*
great
for
my
strength
,
and
I
was
compelled
to
lay
it
down
in
the
middle
*NL*
of
my
career
.
Oh
,
shall
I
then
,
again
become
a
fatalist
,
whom
fourteen
*NL*
years
of
despair
and
ten
of
hope
had
rendered
a
believer
in
providence
?
*NL*
And
all
this
--
all
this
,
because
my
heart
,
which
I
thought
dead
,
was
only
*NL*
sleeping
;
because
it
has
awakened
and
has
begun
to
beat
again
,
because
*NL*
I
have
yielded
to
the
pain
of
the
emotion
excited
in
my
breast
by
a
*NL*
woman
's
voice
.
Yet
,
''
continued
the
count
,
becoming
each
moment
more
*NL*
absorbed
in
the
anticipation
of
the
dreadful
sacrifice
for
the
morrow
,
*NL*
which
Mercedes
had
accepted
,
``
yet
,
it
is
impossible
that
so
noble-minded
*NL*
a
woman
should
thus
through
selfishness
consent
to
my
death
when
I
am
in
*NL*
the
prime
of
life
and
strength
;
it
is
impossible
that
she
can
carry
to
*NL*
such
a
point
maternal
love
,
or
rather
delirium
.
There
are
virtues
which
*NL*
become
crimes
by
exaggeration
.
No
,
she
must
have
conceived
some
pathetic
*NL*
scene
;
she
will
come
and
throw
herself
between
us
;
and
what
would
be
*NL*
sublime
here
will
there
appear
ridiculous

The
blush
of
pride
mounted
*NL*
to
the
count

forehead
as
this
thought
passed
through
his
mind

*NL*
``
Ridiculous

repeated
he
;
``

ridicule
will
fall
on
me

I
*NL*
ridiculous
?
No

would
rather
die

*NL*
By
thus
exaggerating
to
his
own
mind
the
anticipated
ill-fortune
of
the
*NL*
next
day
,
to
which
he
had
condemned
himself
by
promising
Mercedes
to
*NL*
spare
her
son
,
the
count
at
last
exclaimed
,
``
Folly
,
folly
,
folly

to
*NL*
carry
generosity
so
far
as
to
put
myself
up
as
a
mark
for
that
young
man
*NL*
to
aim
at
.
He
will
never
believe
that
my
death
was
suicide
;
and
yet
it
*NL*
is
important
for
the
honor
of
my
memory
,
--
and
this
surely
is
not
vanity
,
*NL*
but
a
justifiable
pride
,
--
it
is
important
the
world
should
know
that
*NL*
I
have
consented
,
by
my
free
will
,
to
stop
my
arm
,
already
raised
to
*NL*
strike
,
and
that
with
the
arm
which
has
been
so
powerful
against
others
*NL*
I
have
struck
myself
.
It
must
be
;
it
shall
be

*NL*
Seizing
a
pen
,
he
drew
a
paper
from
a
secret
drawer
in
his
desk
,
and
*NL*
wrote
at
the
bottom
of
the
document
-LRB-
which
was
no
other
than
his
will
,
*NL*
made
since
his
arrival
in
Paris
-RRB-
a
sort
of
codicil
,
clearly
explaining
*NL*
the
nature
of
his
death
.
``
I
do
this
,
O
my
God
,
''
said
he
,
with
his
eyes
*NL*
raised
to
heaven
,
``
as
much
for
thy
honor
as
for
mine
.
I
have
during
ten
*NL*
years
considered
myself
the
agent

thy
vengeance
,
and
other
wretches
,
*NL*
like
Morcerf

Danglars
,
Villefort
,
even
Morcerf
himself

must
not
*NL*
imagine
that
chance
has
freed
them
from
their
enemy

know

on
the
contrary

that
their
punishment
,
which
had
been
decreed
by

providence

is
only
delayed
by
my
present
determination
,
and
although
*NL*
they
escape
it
in
this

it
awaits
them
in
another

and
that
they
*NL*
are
only
exchanging
time
for

While
he
was
thus
agitated
by
gloomy
uncertainties
,
--
wretched
waking
*NL*
dreams
of
grief
,
--
the
first
rays
of
morning
pierced
his
windows
,
and
*NL*
shone
upon
the
pale
blue
paper
on
which
he
had
just
inscribed
his
*NL*
justification
of
providence
.
It
was
just
five
o'clock
in
the
morning
*NL*
when
a
slight
noise
like
a
stifled
sigh
reached
his
ear
.
He
turned
his
*NL*
head
,
looked
around
him
,
and
saw
no
one
;
but
the
sound
was
repeated
*NL*
distinctly
enough
to
convince
him
of
its
reality
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
arose
,
and
quietly
opening
the
door
of
the
drawing-room
,
saw
Haidee
,
*NL*
who
had
fallen
on
a
chair
,
with
her
arms
hanging
down
and
her
beautiful
*NL*
head
thrown
back
.
She
had
been
standing
at
the
door
,
to
prevent
his
*NL*
going
out
without
seeing
her
,
until
sleep
,
which
the
young
can
not
*NL*
resist
,
had
overpowered
her
frame
,
wearied
as
she
was
with
watching
.
The
*NL*
noise
of
the
door
did
not
awaken
her
,
and
Monte
Cristo
gazed
at
her
with
*NL*
affectionate
regret
.
``
She
remembered
that
she
had
a
son
,
''
said
he
;
``
and
*NL*
I
forgot
I
had
a
daughter
.
''
Then
,
shaking
his
head
sorrowfully
,
``
Poor
*NL*
Haidee
,
''
said
he
;
``
she
wished
to
see
me
,
to
speak
to
me
;
she
has
feared
*NL*
or
guessed
something
.
Oh
,
I
can
not
go
without
taking
leave
of
her
;
I
*NL*
can
not
die
without
confiding
her
to
some
one
.
''
He
quietly
regained
his
*NL*
seat
,
and
wrote
under
the
other
lines
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
bequeath
to
Maximilian
Morrel
,
captain
of
Spahis
,
--
and
son
of
my
*NL*
former
patron
,
Pierre
Morrel
,
shipowner
at
Marseilles
,
--
the
sum
of
*NL*
twenty
millions
,
a
part
of
which
may
be
offered
to
his
sister
Julia
and
*NL*
brother-in-law
Emmanuel
,
if
he
does
not
fear
this
increase
of
fortune
*NL*
may
mar
their
happiness
.
These
twenty
millions
are
concealed
in
my
*NL*
grotto
at
Monte
Cristo
,
of
which
Bertuccio
knows
the
secret
.
If
his
*NL*
heart
is
free
,
and
he
will
marry
Haidee
,
the
daughter
of
Ali
Pasha
of
*NL*
Yanina
,
whom
I
have
brought
up
with
the
love
of
a

who

has
shown
the
love
and
tenderness
of
a
daughter
for
me

he
will
thus
*NL*
accomplish
my
last
wish

This
will
has
already
constituted
Haidee

heiress

the
rest
of
my
fortune
,
consisting
of
lands
,
funds
in
*NL*
England
,
Austria

Holland

furniture
in
my
different
palaces

*NL*
houses
,
and
which
without
the
twenty
millions

the
legacies
to
my

servants

may
still
amount
to
sixty
millions
.

*NL*
*NL*
He
was
finishing
the
last
line
when
a
cry
behind
him
made
him
start
,
and
*NL*
the
pen
fell
from
his
hand
.
``
Haidee
,
''
said
he
,
``
did
you
read
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
lord

''
said
she
,
``
why
are
you
writing
thus
at
such
an
hour

Why
*NL*
are
you
bequeathing
all
your

?
Are
you
going
to
leave
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
going
on
a
journey
,
dear

said
Monte
Cristo
,
with
an
*NL*
expression
of
infinite
tenderness
and
melancholy
;
``
and
if
any
misfortune
*NL*
should
happen
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
count
stopped
.
``
Well
?
''
asked
the
young
girl
,
with
an
authoritative
*NL*
tone
the
count
had
never
observed
before
,
and
which
startled
him
.
*NL*
``
Well
,
if
any
misfortune
happen
to
me
,
''
replied
Monte
Cristo
,
``
I
wish
*NL*
my
daughter
to
be
happy
.
''
Haidee
smiled
sorrowfully
,
and
shook
her
head
.
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
of
dying
,
my
lord
?
''
said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
wise
man
,
my
child
,
has
said
,

It
is
good
to
think
of
death

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
if
you
die
,
''
said
she
,
``
bequeath
your
fortune
to
others
,
for
if
*NL*
you
die
I
shall
require
nothing
;
''
and
,
taking
the
paper
,
she
tore
it
in
*NL*
four
pieces
,
and
threw
it
into
the
middle
of
the
room
.
Then
,
the
effort
*NL*
having
exhausted
her
strength
,
she
fell
not
asleep
this
time
,
but
*NL*
fainting
on
the
floor
.
The
count
leaned
over
her
and
raised
her
in
his
*NL*
arms
;
and
seeing
that
sweet
pale
face
,
those
lovely
eyes
closed
,
that
*NL*
beautiful
form
motionless
and
to
all
appearance
lifeless
,
the
idea
*NL*
occurred
to
him
for
the
first
time
,
that
perhaps
she
loved
him
otherwise
*NL*
than
as
a
daughter
loves
a
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas
,
''
murmured
he
,
with
intense
suffering
,
``
I
might
,
then
,
have
been
*NL*
happy
yet
.
''
Then
he
carried
Haidee
to
her
room
,
resigned
her
to
the
care
*NL*
of
her
attendants
,
and
returning
to
his
study
,
which
he
shut
quickly
*NL*
this
time
,
he
again
copied
the
destroyed
will
.
As
he
was
finishing
,
*NL*
the
sound
of
a
cabriolet
entering
the
yard
was
heard
.
Monte
Cristo
*NL*
approached
the
window
,
and
saw
Maximilian
and
Emmanuel
alight
.
``
Good
,
''
*NL*
said
he
;
``
it
was
time
,
''
--
and
he
sealed
his
will
with
three
seals
.
A
*NL*
moment
afterwards
he
heard
a
noise
in
the
drawing-room
,
and
went
to
open
*NL*
the
door
himself
.
Morrel
was
there
;
he
had
come
twenty
minutes
before
*NL*
the
time
appointed
.
``
I
am
perhaps
come
too
soon
,
count
,
''
said
he
,
``
but
*NL*
I
frankly
acknowledge
that
I
have
not
closed
my
eyes
all
night
,
nor
*NL*
has
any
one
in
my
house
.
I
need
to
see
you
strong
in
your
courageous
*NL*
assurance
,
to
recover
myself
.
''
Monte
Cristo
could
not
resist
this
proof
*NL*
of
affection
;
he
not
only
extended
his
hand
to
the
young
man
,
but
flew
*NL*
to
him
with
open
arms
.
``
Morrel
,
''
said
he
,
``

is
a
happy
day

Good-morning

come
with

*NL*
*NL*
``
Did

said
the
young
captain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But

--
*NL*
*NL*

I
watched

whole

challenge

*NL*
have
been
thinking
of

firmness
all
night

I
said
to
myself
that

justice
must
be
on
your
side

no
longer

*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
``
Simply

*NL*
``
Yes

reminded

*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank

Then
ringing
the
bell
once
,
``
Look

said
he
to
Ali

*NL*
who
came
immediately
,
``

*NL*

Morrel
,
``
you
dead

*NL*
*NL*

Yes

you
do
yesterday
after
you
left
me

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
went
to
Tortoni

I

I

*NL*
``
Why

Well

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

the

is
blind

*NL*
*NL*
``
Have

asked
Monte

quickly
,
with
an
imperceptible

gleam
of
hope

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

*NL*
*NL*
``
Never

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

we
have
time

''
Monte
Cristo
took
the
pistols
he
held
in
his
*NL*
hand
when
Mercedes
entered
,
and
fixing
an
ace
of
clubs
against
the
iron
*NL*
plate
,
with
four
shots
he
successively
shot
off
the
four
sides
of
the
*NL*
club
.
At
each
shot
Morrel
turned
pale
.
He
examined
the
bullets
with
*NL*
which
Monte
Cristo
performed
this
dexterous
feat
,
and
saw
that
they
were
*NL*
no
larger
than
buckshot
.
``
It
is
astonishing
,
''
said
he
.
``
Look
,
Emmanuel
.
''
*NL*
Then
turning
towards
Monte
Cristo
,
``
Count

said
he
,
``
in
the
name
of
*NL*
all
that
is
dear

unhappy

a
mother

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
right

said
Monte

;
``
and
I
have
none

These
words
*NL*
were
uttered
in
a
tone
which
made
Morrel
shudder
.
``
You
are
the
offended
*NL*
party

*NL*
*NL*
``
Doubtless

*NL*

*NL*
``
I

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

I
obtained

*NL*
``
And
at

*NL*

Twenty

A
smile

terrible
import
passed
over
the

lips

ghost

Maximilian

Emmanuel
*NL*
looked
at
each
other
.
Monte
Cristo
drew
out
his
watch
.
``
Let
us
go
,

said
*NL*
he
;
``
it
is
five
minutes
past
seven

and
the
appointment
was
for
eight
*NL*
o'clock

''
A
carriage
was
in
readiness
at
the
door
.
Monte
Cristo
stepped
*NL*
into
it
with
his
two
friends
.
He
had
stopped
a
moment
in
the
passage
*NL*
to
listen
at
a
door
,
and
Maximilian
and
Emmanuel
,
who
had
considerately
*NL*
passed
forward
a
few
steps
,
thought
they
heard
him
answer
by
a
sigh
to
a
*NL*
sob
from
within
.
As
the
clock
struck
eight
they
drove
up
to
the
place
of
*NL*
meeting
.
``
We
are
first
,
''
said
Morrel
,
looking
out
of
the
window
.
``
Excuse
*NL*
me

said
Baptistin

who
had
followed
his
master
with
indescribable
*NL*
terror
,
``
but
I
think
I
see

down
there
under

trees

*NL*
*NL*
Monte

sprang
lightly
from
the
carriage
,
and
offered
his
hand
to
*NL*
assist
Emmanuel
and
Maximilian
.
The
latter
retained
the
count
's
hand
*NL*
between
his
.
``
I
like
,
''
said
he
,
``
to
feel
a

owner
relies
on

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
seems
to
me

Emmanuel

``
that
I
see
two
young
men
down
there

are
evidently

Monte

drew
Morrel
a
step
or
two
*NL*
behind
his
brother-in-law
.
``
Maximilian

said
he
,
``

Morrel
looked
at
Monte

with
astonishment
.
``
I
do
not

seek
your

it

Then
,
with
a

he

*NL*
*NL*
``
To
tell

``
Because

*NL*
we
must

paid

That

Morrel
advanced
towards
Beauchamp
and
*NL*
Chateau-Renaud
,
who
,
seeing
his
intention
,
came
to
meet
him
.
The
three
*NL*
young
men
bowed
to
each
other
courteously
,
if
not
affably
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excuse
me
,
gentlemen

said
Morrel
,
``
but
I
do
not
see
M.

*NL*
*NL*
``
He
sent
us
word
this

replied
Chateau-Renaud
,
``
that
he
would
*NL*
meet
us
on
the
ground

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

said
Morrel
.
Beauchamp
pulled
out
his
watch
.
``
It
is
only
five
*NL*
minutes
past
eight
,

said
he
to
Morrel
;
``
there
is
not
much
time
lost
*NL*
yet

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
made
no
allusion
of
that

replied
Morrel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
a
carriage
coming
,

said
Chateau-Renaud

It
advanced
rapidly
*NL*
along
one
of
the
avenues
leading
towards
the
open
space
where
they
were
*NL*
assembled
.
``
You
are
doubtless
provided
with
pistols

M.

Monte

yields
his
right
of
using

.

*NL*
*NL*
``
We
had
anticipated
this
kindness
on
the
part
of
the
count

said
*NL*
Beauchamp
,
``

I
have
brought
some
weapons
which
I
bought
eight

ten

days

thinking

a
similar
occasion

you
examine

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

The
two
young
men
he
*NL*
announced
were
indeed
approaching
.
``
What
chance
brings
you
here

*NL*

said
Chateau-Renaud

shaking
hands
with
each
of
them

*NL*
``
Because

said
Debray
,
``
Albert
sent
this
morning
to
request

Beauchamp
and
Chateau-Renaud
exchanged
looks
of
astonishment

``
I
*NL*
think
I
understand

Morrel

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yesterday
afternoon
I
received
a

begging

*NL*
*NL*

*NL*

Beauchamp

Chateau-Renaud

*NL*
*NL*
``
Having
wished

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Exactly
so
,
''
said
the
young
men
;
``
you
have
probably
guessed
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
after
all
these
arrangements

he
does
not

*NL*
Chateau-Renaud

``
Albert
is
ten
minutes
after
time

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
he
comes

Beauchamp
,
``
on
horseback
,
at
full
gallop
,
*NL*
followed
by
a
servant

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
imprudent
,

said
Chateau-Renaud
,
``

fight
a

*NL*
*NL*

said
Beauchamp

``
with
a
collar
above

Why
has
he
not
painted
a
spot
upon
his
*NL*
heart

it
would
have
been
more
simple

Meanwhile
Albert
had
arrived
*NL*
within
ten
paces
of
the
group
formed
by
the
five
young
men
.
He
jumped
*NL*
from
his
horse
,
threw
the
bridle
on
his
servant
's
arms
,
and
joined
them
.
*NL*
He
was
pale
,
and
his
eyes
were
red
and
swollen
;
it
was
evident
that
he
*NL*
had
not
slept
.
A
shade
of
melancholy
gravity
overspread
his
countenance
,
*NL*
which
was
not
natural
to
him
.
``
I
thank
you
,
gentlemen
,

said
he
,
``
for
*NL*
having
complied
with
my
request

I
feel
extremely
grateful

mark
of

Morrel
had
stepped
back
as
Morcerf
approached
,
and
*NL*
remained
at
a
short
distance
.
``
And
to
you
also
,
M.

*NL*
due

Come

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
``
I

*NL*
*NL*
``
M.

Chateau-Renaud

will
you
apprise

arrived

at
his

''
*NL*
Morrel
was
preparing
to
fulfil
his
commission
.
Beauchamp
had
meanwhile
*NL*
drawn
the
box
of
pistols
from
the
carriage
.
``
Stop
,
gentlemen

*NL*
Albert
;

I
have
two
words
to
say

In

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

before
all

are
here

''
*NL*
*NL*
Albert
's
witnesses
looked
at
each
other
.
Franz
and
Debray
exchanged
some
*NL*
words
in
a
whisper
,
and
Morrel
,
rejoiced
at
this
unexpected
incident
,
*NL*
went
to
fetch
the
count
,
who
was
walking
in
a
retired
path
with
*NL*
Emmanuel
.
``
What
does
he
want
with
me
?
''
said
Monte
Cristo
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
know
,
but
he
wishes
to
speak
to
you

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
?
''
said
Monte

,
``
I
trust
he
is
not
going
to
tempt
me
by
some
*NL*
fresh
insult
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
think
that
such
is
his
intention

''
said
Morrel
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
count
advanced
,
accompanied
by
Maximilian
and
Emmanuel
.
His
calm
and
*NL*
serene
look
formed
a
singular
contrast
to
Albert
's
grief-stricken
face
,
*NL*
who
approached
also
,
followed
by
the
other
four
young
men
.
When
at
three
*NL*
paces
distant
from
each
other
,
Albert
and
the
count
stopped
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Approach
,
gentlemen

said
Albert
;
``
I
wish
you
not
to
lose
one
word

what
I
am
about

have
the
honor

the
Count
of
Monte
*NL*
Cristo
,
for
it
must
be
repeated
by
you
to
all
who
will
listen

*NL*
strange
as
it
may
appear
to
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
Proceed

''
said
the
count
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir

''
said
Albert
,
at
first
with
a
tremulous
voice
,
but
which
gradually
*NL*
became
firmer
,
``
I
reproached
you
with
exposing
the
conduct
of
M.

*NL*
Morcerf
in
Epirus
,
for
guilty
as
I
knew
he
was
,
I
thought
you
had
no
*NL*
right
to
punish
him
;
but
I
have
since
learned
that
you
had
that
right
.
*NL*
It
is
not
Fernand
Mondego
's
treachery
towards
Ali
Pasha
which
induces
*NL*
me
so
readily
to
excuse
you
,
but
the
treachery
of
the
fisherman
*NL*
Fernand
towards
you
,
and
the
almost
unheard-of
miseries
which
were
*NL*
its
consequences
;
and
I
say
,
and
proclaim
it
publicly
,
that
you
were
*NL*
justified
in
revenging
yourself
on
my
father
,
and
I
,
his
son

thank
you
*NL*
for
not
using
greater
severity

*NL*
*NL*
Had
a
thunderbolt
fallen
in
the
midst
of
the
spectators
of
this
*NL*
unexpected
scene
,
it
would
not
have
surprised
them
more
than
did
*NL*
Albert
's
declaration
.
As
for
Monte
Cristo
,
his
eyes
slowly
rose
towards
*NL*
heaven
with
an
expression
of
infinite
gratitude
.
He
could
not
understand
*NL*
how
Albert
's
fiery
nature
,
of
which
he
had
seen
so
much
among
the
Roman
*NL*
bandits
,
had
suddenly
stooped
to
this
humiliation
.
He
recognized
the
*NL*
influence
of
Mercedes
,
and
saw
why
her
noble
heart
had
not
opposed
the
*NL*
sacrifice
she
knew
beforehand
would
be
useless
.
``
Now
,
sir
,
''
said
Albert
,
*NL*
``
if
you
think
my
apology
sufficient

pray
give
me
your
hand

Next
to
*NL*
the
merit
of
infallibility
which
you
appear
to
possess
,
I
rank
that
of
*NL*
candidly
acknowledging
a
fault
.
But
this
confession
concerns
me
only
.
I
*NL*
acted
well
as
a
man
,
but
you
have
acted
better
than
man

An
angel
alone
*NL*
could
have
saved
one
of
us
from
death

that
angel
came
from
heaven

if
*NL*
not
to
make
us
friends

which
,
alas

fatality
renders
impossible
-RRB-
,
at
*NL*
least
to
make
us
esteem
each
other

''
*NL*
*NL*
Monte
Cristo
,
with
moistened
eye
,
heaving
breast
,
and
lips
half
open
,
*NL*
extended
to
Albert
a
hand
which
the
latter
pressed
with
a
sentiment
*NL*
resembling
respectful
fear
.
``
Gentlemen

said
he
,

receives

generally
bad
ones

Now
my

is
repaired

cowardly

acting

conscience
dictated

any

entertain

added
he
,
drawing
himself
up
*NL*
as
if
he
would
challenge
both
friends
and
enemies
,
``
I
shall
endeavor

*NL*
correct
his
mistake

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
happened
during
the
night

asked
Beauchamp
of
Chateau-Renaud

make
a
very
sorry
figure
here

*NL*
*NL*

In
truth

what

just
done

noble

the
baron

it

As
for
Monte

,
his
head
was
bent
down
,
his
*NL*
arms
were
powerless

Bowing
under
the
weight
of
twenty-four
*NL*
years

reminiscences
,
he
thought
not
of
Albert
,
of
Beauchamp

of
*NL*
Chateau-Renaud
,
or
of
any
of
that
group
;
but
he
thought
of
that

courageous
woman
who
had
come
to
plead
for
her
son
's
life
,
to
whom
*NL*
he
had
offered
his
,
and
who
had
now
saved
it
by
the
revelation
of
a
*NL*
dreadful

secret

capable
of
destroying
forever
in

``

The
Count
of
Monte

bowed
to
the
five
young
men
with
a
melancholy
*NL*
and
dignified
smile
,
and
got
into
his
carriage
with
Maximilian
and
*NL*
Emmanuel
.
Albert
,
Beauchamp
,
and
Chateau-Renaud
remained
alone
.
Albert
*NL*
looked
at
his
two
friends
,
not
timidly
,
but
in
a
way
that
appeared
to
*NL*
ask
their
opinion
of
what
he
had
just
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
my
dear
friend

''
said
Beauchamp
first
,
who
had
either
the
most
*NL*
feeling
or
the
least
dissimulation
,
``
allow
me
to
congratulate
you

this

is
a

unhoped-for
conclusion

disagreeable

''
*NL*
*NL*
Albert
remained
silent
and
wrapped
in
thought
.
Chateau-Renaud
contented
*NL*
himself
with
tapping
his
boot
with
his
flexible
cane
.
``
Are
we
not
*NL*
going
?
''
said
he
,
after
this
embarrassing
silence
.
``
When
you
please

*NL*
replied
Beauchamp
;
``
allow
me
only
to
compliment
M.

*NL*
given
proof
to-day

*NL*
``

exercise

much
self-control

*NL*
*NL*
``
Assuredly

I

Chateau-Renaud
,
with
most
significant
coolness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gentlemen

interrupted
Albert
,
``
I
think
you
did
not
understand

myself

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Possibly

possibly

said
Beauchamp
immediately
;
``

every

sooner

later
you

find
yourself
compelled

explain
it

them
more
energetically
*NL*
than
would
be
convenient

your
bodily
health

the
duration

May
I
give
you
a
friendly
counsel

Set
out
for
Naples

the
Hague
,
*NL*
or
St.
Petersburg
--
calm
countries
,
where
the
point
of
honor
is
better

understood
than
among
our
hot-headed
Parisians

Seek
quietude

*NL*
oblivion

so
that
you
may
return
peaceably
to
France
after
a
few
years

M.

*NL*
``
That

duel
forsworn
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
gentlemen
,
''
replied
Albert
,
with
a
smile
of
indifference
;
*NL*
``
I
shall
follow
your
advice
--
not
because
you
give
it
,
but
because
I
had
*NL*
before
intended
to
quit
France
.
I
thank
you
equally
for
the
service
you
*NL*
have
rendered
me
in
being
my
seconds
.
It
is
deeply
engraved
on
my
*NL*
heart
,
and
,
after
what
you
have
just
said
,
I
remember
that
only
.
''
*NL*
Chateau-Renaud
and
Beauchamp
looked
at
each
other
;
the
impression
*NL*
was
the
same
on
both
of
them
,
and
the
tone
in
which
Morcerf
had
just
*NL*
expressed
his
thanks
was
so
determined
that
the
position
would
have
*NL*
become
embarrassing
for
all
if
the
conversation
had
continued
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-by
,
Albert
,
''
said
Beauchamp
suddenly
,
carelessly
extending
his
*NL*
hand
to
the
young
man
.
The
latter
did
not
appear
to
arouse
from
his
*NL*
lethargy
;
in
fact
,
he
did
not
notice
the
offered
hand
.
``
Good-by
,
''
said
*NL*
Chateau-Renaud
in
his
turn
,
keeping
his
little
cane
in
his
left
hand
,
*NL*
and
saluting
with
his
right
.
Albert
's
lips
scarcely
whispered
``
Good-by
,
''
*NL*
but
his
look
was
more
explicit
;
it
expressed
a
whole
poem
of
restrained
*NL*
anger
,
proud
disdain
,
and
generous
indignation
.
He
preserved
his
*NL*
melancholy
and
motionless
position
for
some
time
after
his
two
friends
*NL*
had
regained
their
carriage
;
then
suddenly
unfastening
his
horse
*NL*
from
the
little
tree
to
which
his
servant
had
tied
it
,
he
mounted
and
*NL*
galloped
off
in
the
direction
of
Paris
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
quarter
of
an
hour
he
was
entering
the
house
in
the
Rue
du
Helder
.
*NL*
As
he
alighted
,
he
thought
he
saw
his
father
's
pale
face
behind
the
*NL*
curtain
of
the
count
's
bedroom
.
Albert
turned
away
his
head
with
a
sigh
,
*NL*
and
went
to
his
own
apartments
.
He
cast
one
lingering
look
on
all
the
*NL*
luxuries
which
had
rendered
life
so
easy
and
so
happy
since
his
*NL*
infancy
;
he
looked
at
the
pictures
,
whose
faces
seemed
to
smile
,
and
the
*NL*
landscapes
,
which
appeared
painted
in
brighter
colors
.
Then
he
took
away
*NL*
his
mother
's
portrait
,
with
its
oaken
frame
,
leaving
the
gilt
frame
from
*NL*
which
he
took
it
black
and
empty
.
Then
he
arranged
all
his
beautiful
*NL*
Turkish
arms
,
his
fine
English
guns
,
his
Japanese
china
,
his
cups
*NL*
mounted
in
silver
,
his
artistic
bronzes
by
Feucheres
and
Barye
;
examined
*NL*
the
cupboards
,
and
placed
the
key
in
each
;
threw
into
a
drawer
of
his
*NL*
secretary
,
which
he
left
open
,
all
the
pocket-money
he
had
about
*NL*
him
,
and
with
it
the
thousand
fancy
jewels
from
his
vases
and
his
*NL*
jewel-boxes
;
then
he
made
an
exact
inventory
of
everything
,
and
placed
*NL*
it
in
the
most
conspicuous
part
of
the
table
,
after
putting
aside
the
*NL*
books
and
papers
which
had
collected
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
beginning
of
this
work
,
his
servant
,
notwithstanding
orders
to
*NL*
the
contrary
,
came
to
his
room
.
``
What
do
you
want
?
''
asked
he
,
with
a
*NL*
more
sorrowful
than
angry
tone
.
``
Pardon
me
,
sir
,
''
replied
the
valet
;
*NL*
``
you
had
forbidden
me
to
disturb
you
,
but
the
Count
of
Morcerf
has
*NL*
called
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
''
said
Albert
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
not
like
to
go
to
him
without
first
seeing
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
the
count
is
doubtless
aware
that
I
accompanied
you
to
the
*NL*
meeting
this
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
probable
,
''
said
Albert
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
since
he
has
sent
for
me
,
it
is
doubtless
to
question
me
on
what
*NL*
happened
there
.
What
must
I
answer
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
truth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
shall
say
the
duel
did
not
take
place
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
say
I
apologized
to
the
Count
of
Monte
Cristo
.
Go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
valet
bowed
and
retired
,
and
Albert
returned
to
his
inventory
.
As
he
*NL*
was
finishing
this
work
,
the
sound
of
horses
prancing
in
the
yard
,
and
*NL*
the
wheels
of
a
carriage
shaking
his
window
,
attracted
his
attention
.
He
*NL*
approached
the
window
,
and
saw
his
father
get
into
it
,
and
drive
away
.
*NL*
The
door
was
scarcely
closed
when
Albert
bent
his
steps
to
his
mother
's
*NL*
room
;
and
,
no
one
being
there
to
announce
him
,
he
advanced
to
her
*NL*
bed-chamber
,
and
distressed
by
what
he
saw
and
guessed
,
stopped
for
one
*NL*
moment
at
the
door
.
As
if
the
same
idea
had
animated
these
two
beings
,
*NL*
Mercedes
was
doing
the
same
in
her
apartments
that
he
had
just
done
in
*NL*
his
.
Everything
was
in
order
,
--
laces
,
dresses
,
jewels
,
linen
,
money
,
all
*NL*
were
arranged
in
the
drawers
,
and
the
countess
was
carefully
collecting
*NL*
the
keys
.
Albert
saw
all
these
preparations
and
understood
them
,
and
*NL*
exclaiming
,
``
My
mother
!
''
he
threw
his
arms
around
her
neck
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
artist
who
could
have
depicted
the
expression
of
these
two
*NL*
countenances
would
certainly
have
made
of
them
a
beautiful
picture
.
All
*NL*
these
proofs
of
an
energetic
resolution
,
which
Albert
did
not
fear
on
*NL*
his
own
account
,
alarmed
him
for
his
mother
.
``
What
are
you
doing
?
''
asked
*NL*
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
were
you
doing
?
''
replied
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
mother
!
''
exclaimed
Albert
,
so
overcome
he
could
scarcely
speak
;
*NL*
``
it
is
not
the
same
with
you
and
me
--
you
can
not
have
made
the
same
*NL*
resolution
I
have
,
for
I
have
come
to
warn
you
that
I
bid
adieu
to
your
*NL*
house
,
and
--
and
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
also
,
''
replied
Mercedes
,
``
am
going
,
and
I
acknowledge
I
had
depended
*NL*
on
your
accompanying
me
;
have
I
deceived
myself
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mother
,
''
said
Albert
with
firmness
.
``
I
can
not
make
you
share
the
fate
*NL*
I
have
planned
for
myself
.
I
must
live
henceforth
without
rank
and
*NL*
fortune
,
and
to
begin
this
hard
apprenticeship
I
must
borrow
from
a
*NL*
friend
the
loaf
I
shall
eat
until
I
have
earned
one
.
So
,
my
dear
mother
,
*NL*
I
am
going
at
once
to
ask
Franz
to
lend
me
the
small
sum
I
shall
require
*NL*
to
supply
my
present
wants
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
,
my
poor
child
,
suffer
poverty
and
hunger
?
Oh
,
do
not
say
so
;
it
*NL*
will
break
my
resolutions
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
not
mine
,
mother
,
''
replied
Albert
.
``
I
am
young
and
strong
;
I
*NL*
believe
I
am
courageous
,
and
since
yesterday
I
have
learned
the
power
*NL*
of
will
.
Alas
,
my
dear
mother
,
some
have
suffered
so
much
,
and
yet
*NL*
live
,
and
have
raised
a
new
fortune
on
the
ruin
of
all
the
promises
of
*NL*
happiness
which
heaven
had
made
them
--
on
the
fragments
of
all
the
hope
*NL*
which
God
had
given
them
!
I
have
seen
that
,
mother
;
I
know
that
from
the
*NL*
gulf
in
which
their
enemies
have
plunged
them
they
have
risen
with
so
*NL*
much
vigor
and
glory
that
in
their
turn
they
have
ruled
their
former
*NL*
conquerors
,
and
have
punished
them
.
No
,
mother
;
from
this
moment
I
have
*NL*
done
with
the
past
,
and
accept
nothing
from
it
--
not
even
a
name
,
because
*NL*
you
can
understand
that
your
son
can
not
bear
the
name
of
a
man
who
ought
*NL*
to
blush
for
it
before
another
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Albert
,
my
child
,
''
said
Mercedes
,
``
if
I
had
a
stronger
heart
,
that
is
*NL*
the
counsel
I
would
have
given
you
;
your
conscience
has
spoken
when
my
*NL*
voice
became
too
weak
;
listen
to
its
dictates
.
You
had
friends
,
Albert
;
*NL*
break
off
their
acquaintance
.
But
do
not
despair
;
you
have
life
before
*NL*
you
,
my
dear
Albert
,
for
you
are
yet
scarcely
twenty-two
years
old
;
and
*NL*
as
a
pure
heart
like
yours
wants
a
spotless
name
,
take
my
father

--
it
*NL*
was
Herrera

I
am
sure
,
my
dear
Albert
,
whatever
may
be
your
career
,
*NL*
you
will
soon
render
that
name
illustrious
.
Then
,
my
son
,
return
to
the
*NL*
world
still
more
brilliant
because
of
your
former
sorrows
;
and
if
I
am
*NL*
wrong
,
still
let
me
cherish
these
hopes
,
for
I
have
no
future
to
look
*NL*
forward
to
.
For
me
the
grave
opens
when
I
pass
the
threshold
of
this
*NL*
house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
fulfil
all
your
wishes
,
my
dear
mother

''
said
the
young
man
.
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
share
your
hopes
;
the
anger
of
heaven
will
not
pursue
us
,
since
*NL*
you
are
pure
and
I
am
innocent
.
But
,
since
our
resolution
is
formed
,
*NL*
let
us
act
promptly
.
M.
de
Morcerf
went
out
about
half
an
hour
ago
;
the
*NL*
opportunity
is
favorable
to
avoid
an
explanation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
ready
,
my
son
,
''
said
Mercedes
.
Albert
ran
to
fetch
a
carriage
.
He
*NL*
recollected
that
there
was
a
small
furnished
house
to
let
in
the
Rue
de
*NL*
Saints
Peres
,
where
his
mother
would
find
a
humble
but
decent
lodging
,
*NL*
and
thither
he
intended
conducting
the
countess
.
As
the
carriage
stopped
*NL*
at
the
door
,
and
Albert
was
alighting
,
a
man
approached
and
gave
him
a
*NL*
letter
.
Albert
recognized
the
bearer
.
``
From
the
count
,
''
said
Bertuccio
.
*NL*
Albert
took
the
letter
,
opened
,
and
read
it
,
then
looked
round
for
*NL*
Bertuccio
,
but
he
was
gone
.
He
returned
to
Mercedes
with
tears
in
his
*NL*
eyes
and
heaving
breast
,
and
without
uttering
a
word
he
gave
her
the
*NL*
letter
.
Mercedes
read
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
Albert
,
--
While
showing
you
that
I
have
discovered
your
plans
,
I
hope
*NL*
also
to
convince
you
of
my
delicacy
.
You
are
free
,
you
leave
the
count
's
*NL*
house
,
and
you
take
your
mother
to
your
home
;
but
reflect
,
Albert
,
you
*NL*
owe
her
more
than
your
poor
noble
heart
can
pay
her
.
Keep
the
struggle
*NL*
for
yourself
,
bear
all
the
suffering
,
but
spare
her
the
trial
of
poverty
*NL*
which
must
accompany
your
first
efforts
;
for
she
deserves
not
even
*NL*
the
shadow
of
the
misfortune
which
has
this
day
fallen
on
her
,
and
*NL*
providence
is
not
willing
that
the
innocent
should
suffer
for
the
*NL*
guilty
.
I
know
you
are
going
to
leave
the
Rue
du
Helder
without
taking
*NL*
anything
with
you
.
Do
not
seek
to
know
how
I
discovered
it
;
I
know
*NL*
it
--
that
is
sufficient
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
listen
,
Albert
.
Twenty-four
years
ago
I
returned
,
proud
and
joyful
,
*NL*
to
my
country
.
I
had
a
betrothed
,
Albert
,
a
lovely
girl
whom
I
adored
,
*NL*
and
I
was
bringing
to
my
betrothed
a
hundred
and
fifty
louis
,
painfully
*NL*
amassed
by
ceaseless
toil
.
This
money
was
for
her
;
I
destined
it
for
*NL*
her
,
and
,
knowing
the
treachery
of
the
sea
I
buried
our
treasure
in
*NL*
the
little
garden
of
the
house
my
father
lived
in
at
Marseilles
,
on
the
*NL*
Allees
de
Meillan
.
Your
mother
,
Albert
,
knows
that
poor
house
well
.
A
*NL*
short
time
since
I
passed
through
Marseilles
,
and
went
to
see
the
old
*NL*
place
,
which
revived
so
many
painful
recollections
;
and
in
the
evening
*NL*
I
took
a
spade
and
dug
in
the
corner
of
the
garden
where
I
had
concealed
*NL*
my
treasure
.
The
iron
box
was
there
--
no
one
had
touched
it
--
under
a
*NL*
beautiful
fig-tree
my
father
had
planted
the
day
I
was
born
,
which
*NL*
overshadowed
the
spot
.
Well
,
Albert
,
this
money
,
which
was
formerly
*NL*
designed
to
promote
the
comfort
and
tranquillity
of
the
woman
I
adored
,
*NL*
may
now
,
through
strange
and
painful
circumstances
,
be
devoted
to
the
*NL*
same
purpose
.
Oh
,
feel
for
me
,
who
could
offer
millions
to
that
poor
*NL*
woman
,
but
who
return
her
only
the
piece
of
black
bread
forgotten
*NL*
under
my
poor
roof
since
the
day
I
was
torn
from
her
I
loved
.
You
are
*NL*
a
generous
man
,
Albert
,
but
perhaps
you
may
be
blinded
by
pride
or
*NL*
resentment
;
if
you
refuse
me
,
if
you
ask
another
for
what
I
have
a
right
*NL*
to
offer
you
,
I
will
say
it
is
ungenerous
of
you
to
refuse
the
life
*NL*
of
your
mother
at
the
hands
of
a
man
whose
father
was
allowed
by
your
*NL*
father
to
die
in
all
the
horrors
of
poverty
and
despair
.
*NL*
*NL*
Albert
stood
pale
and
motionless
to
hear
what
his
mother
would
decide
*NL*
after
she
had
finished
reading
this
letter
.
Mercedes
turned
her
eyes
*NL*
with
an
ineffable
look
towards
heaven
.
``
I
accept
it
,
''
said
she
;
``
he
has
*NL*
a
right
to
pay
the
dowry
,
which
I
shall
take
with
me
to
some
convent
!
''
*NL*
Putting
the
letter
in
her
bosom
,
she
took
her
son
's
arm
,
and
with
a
*NL*
firmer
step
than
she
even
herself
expected
she
went
down-stairs

,
in
a
corner
of
the
carriage
,
allowed
his
*NL*
brother-in-law
's
gayety
to
expend
itself
in
words
,
while
he
felt
equal
*NL*
inward
joy
,
which
,
however
,
betrayed
itself
only
in
his
countenance
.
*NL*
At
the
Barriere
du
Trone
they
met
Bertuccio
,
who
was
waiting
there
,
*NL*
motionless
as
a
sentinel
at
his
post
.
Monte
Cristo
put
his
head
out
*NL*
of
the
window
,
exchanged
a
few
words
with
him
in
a
low
tone
,
and
the
*NL*
steward
disappeared
.
``
Count
,
''
said
Emmanuel
,
when
they
were
at
the
end
*NL*
of
the
Place
Royale
,
``
put
me
down
at
my
door
,
that
my
wife
may
not
have
*NL*
a
single
moment
of
needless
anxiety
on
my
account
or
yours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
it
were
not
ridiculous
to
make
a
display
of
our
triumph
,
I
would
*NL*
invite
the
count
to
our
house
;
besides
that
,
he
doubtless
has
some
*NL*
trembling
heart
to
comfort
.
So
we
will
take
leave
of
our
friend
,
and
let
*NL*
him
hasten
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stop
a
moment
,
''
said
Monte
Cristo
;
``
do
not
let
me
lose
both
my
*NL*
companions
.
Return
,
Emmanuel
,
to
your
charming
wife
,
and
present
my
*NL*
best
compliments
to
her
;
and
do
you
,
Morrel
,
accompany
me
to
the
Champs
*NL*
Elysees
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Willingly
,
''
said
Maximilian
;
``
particularly
as
I
have
business
in
that
*NL*
quarter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
we
wait
breakfast
for
you
?
''
asked
Emmanuel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
replied
the
young
man
.
The
door
was
closed
,
and
the
carriage
*NL*
proceeded
.
``
See
what
good
fortune
I
brought
you
!
''
said
Morrel
,
when
he
*NL*
was
alone
with
the
count
.
``
Have
you
not
thought
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Monte
Cristo
;
``
for
that
reason
I
wished
to
keep
you
near
*NL*
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
miraculous
!
''
continued
Morrel
,
answering
his
own
thoughts
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
said
Monte
Cristo
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
has
just
happened
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
the
Count
,
``
you
are
right
--
it
is
miraculous
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
Albert
is
brave
,
''
resumed
Morrel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
brave
,
''
said
Monte
Cristo
;
``
I
have
seen
him
sleep
with
a
sword
*NL*
suspended
over
his
head
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
know
he
has
fought
two
duels
,
''
said
Morrel
.
``
How
can
you
*NL*
reconcile
that
with
his
conduct
this
morning
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
owing
to
your
influence
,
''
replied
Monte
Cristo
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
well
for
Albert
he
is
not
in
the
army
,
''
said
Morrel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
apology
on
the
ground
!
''
said
the
young
captain
,
shaking
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
''
said
the
count
mildly
,
``
do
not
entertain
the
prejudices
of
*NL*
ordinary
men
,
Morrel
!
Acknowledge
,
that
if
Albert
is
brave
,
he
can
not
*NL*
be
a
coward
;
he
must
then
have
had
some
reason
for
acting
as
he
did
this
*NL*
morning
,
and
confess
that
his
conduct
is
more
heroic
than
otherwise
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Doubtless
,
doubtless
,
''
said
Morrel
;
``
but
I
shall
say
,
like
the
*NL*
Spaniard
,
`
He
has
not
been
so
brave
to-day
as
he
was
yesterday
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
breakfast
with
me
,
will
you
not
,
Morrel
?
''
said
the
count
,
to
*NL*
turn
the
conversation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
I
must
leave
you
at
ten
o'clock
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
engagement
was
for
breakfast
,
then
?
''
said
the
count
.
*NL*
*NL*
Morrel
smiled
,
and
shook
his
head
.
``
Still
you
must
breakfast
somewhere
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
if
I
am
not
hungry
?
''
said
the
young
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
said
the
count
,
``
I
only
know
two
things
which
destroy
the
*NL*
appetite
,
--
grief
--
and
as
I
am
happy
to
see
you
very
cheerful
,
it
is
not
*NL*
that
--
and
love
.
Now
after
what
you
told
me
this
morning
of
your
heart
,
I
*NL*
may
believe
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
count
,
''
replied
Morrel
gayly
,
``
I
will
not
dispute
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
will
not
make
me
your
confidant
,
Maximilian
?
''
said
the
count
,
*NL*
in
a
tone
which
showed
how
gladly
he
would
have
been
admitted
to
the
*NL*
secret
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
showed
you
this
morning
that
I
had
a
heart
,
did
I
not
,
count
?
''
Monte
*NL*
Cristo
only
answered
by
extending
his
hand
to
the
young
man
.
``
Well
,
''
*NL*
continued
the
latter
,
``
since
that
heart
is
no
longer
with
you
in
the
*NL*
Bois
de
Vincennes
,
it
is
elsewhere
,
and
I
must
go
and
find
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
,
''
said
the
count
deliberately
;
``
go
,
dear
friend
,
but
promise
me
if
*NL*
you
meet
with
any
obstacle
to
remember
that
I
have
some
power
in
this
*NL*
world
,
that
I
am
happy
to
use
that
power
in
the
behalf
of
those
I
love
,
*NL*
and
that
I
love
you
,
Morrel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
remember
it
,
''
said
the
young
man
,
``
as
selfish
children
recollect
*NL*
their
parents
when
they
want
their
aid
.
When
I
need
your
assistance
,
and
*NL*
the
moment
arrives
,
I
will
come
to
you

count
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
rely
upon
your
promise
.
Good-by
,
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-by
,
till
we
meet
again
.
''
They
had
arrived
in
the
Champs
Elysees
.
*NL*
Monte
Cristo
opened
the
carriage-door
,
Morrel
sprang
out
on
the
*NL*
pavement
,
Bertuccio
was
waiting
on
the
steps
.
Morrel
disappeared
down
*NL*
the
Avenue
de
Marigny
,
and
Monte
Cristo
hastened
to
join
Bertuccio
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
asked
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
going
to
leave
her
house
,
''
said
the
steward
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
her
son
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Florentin
,
his
valet
,
thinks
he
is
going
to
do
the
same
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
this
way
.
''
Monte
Cristo
took
Bertuccio
into
his
study
,
wrote
the
*NL*
letter
we
have
seen
,
and
gave
it
to
the
steward
.
``
Go
,
''
said
he
quickly
.
*NL*
``
But
first
,
let
Haidee
be
informed
that
I
have
returned
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
I
am
,
''
said
the
young
girl
,
who
at
the
sound
of
the
carriage
had
*NL*
run
down-stairs
and
whose
face
was
radiant
with
joy
at
seeing
the
count
*NL*
return
safely
.
Bertuccio
left
.
Every
transport
of
a
daughter
finding
a
*NL*
father
,
all
the
delight
of
a
mistress
seeing
an
adored
lover
,
were
felt
*NL*
by
Haidee
during
the
first
moments
of
this
meeting
,
which
she
had
so
*NL*
eagerly
expected
.
Doubtless
,
although
less
evident
,
Monte
Cristo
's
joy
*NL*
was
not
less
intense
.
Joy
to
hearts
which
have
suffered
long
is
like
the
*NL*
dew
on
the
ground
after
a
long
drought
;
both
the
heart
and
the
ground
*NL*
absorb
that
beneficent
moisture
falling
on
them
,
and
nothing
is
*NL*
outwardly
apparent
.
*NL*
*NL*
Monte
Cristo
was
beginning
to
think
,
what
he
had
not
for
a
long
time
*NL*
dared
to
believe
,
that
there
were
two
Mercedes
in
the
world
,
and
he
*NL*
might
yet
be
happy
.
His
eye
,
elate
with
happiness
,
was
reading
eagerly
*NL*
the
tearful
gaze
of
Haidee
,
when
suddenly
the
door
opened
.
The
count
*NL*
knit
his
brow
.
``
M.
de
Morcerf
!
''
said
Baptistin
,
as
if
that
name
sufficed
*NL*
for
his
excuse
.
In
fact
,
the
count
's
face
brightened
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Which
,
''
asked
he
,
``
the
viscount
or
the
count
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
count
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
exclaimed
Haidee
,
``
is
it
not
yet
over
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
not
if
it
is
finished
,
my
beloved
child
,
''
said
Monte
Cristo
,
*NL*
taking
the
young
girl
's
hands
;
``
but
I
do
know
you
have
nothing
more
to
*NL*
fear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
is
the
wretched
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
man
can
not
injure
me
,
Haidee
,
''
said
Monte
Cristo
;
``
it
was
his
son
*NL*
alone
that
there
was
cause
to
fear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
I
have
suffered
,
''
said
the
young
girl
,
``
you
shall
never
know
,
*NL*
my
lord
.
''
Monte
Cristo
smiled
.
``
By
my
father
's
tomb
,
''
said
he
,
extending
*NL*
his
hand
over
the
head
of
the
young
girl
,
``
I
swear
to
you
,
Haidee
,
that
*NL*
if
any
misfortune
happens
,
it
will
not
be
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
you
,
my
lord
,
as
implicitly
as
if
God
had
spoken
to
me
,
''
said
*NL*
the
young
girl
,
presenting
her
forehead
to
him
.
Monte
Cristo
pressed
on
*NL*
that
pure
beautiful
forehead
a
kiss
which
made
two
hearts
throb
at
once
,
*NL*
the
one
violently
,
the
other
heavily
.
``
Oh
,
''
murmured
the
count
,
``
shall
*NL*
I
then
be
permitted
to
love
again
?
Ask
M.
de
Morcerf
into
the
*NL*
drawing-room
,
''
said
he
to
Baptistin
,
while
he
led
the
beautiful
Greek
*NL*
girl
to
a
private
staircase
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
must
explain
this
visit
,
which
although
expected
by
Monte
Cristo
,
is
*NL*
unexpected
to
our
readers
.
While
Mercedes
,
as
we
have
said
,
was
making
*NL*
a
similar
inventory
of
her
property
to
Albert
's
,
while
she
was
arranging
*NL*
her
jewels
,
shutting
her
drawers
,
collecting
her
keys
,
to
leave
*NL*
everything
in
perfect
order
,
she
did
not
perceive
a
pale
and
sinister
*NL*
face
at
a
glass
door
which
threw
light
into
the
passage
,
from
which
*NL*
everything
could
be
both
seen
and
heard
.
He
who
was
thus
looking
,
*NL*
without
being
heard
or
seen
,
probably
heard
and
saw
all
that
passed
in
*NL*
Madame
de
Morcerf
's
apartments
.
From
that
glass
door
the
pale-faced
*NL*
man
went
to
the
count
's
bedroom
and
raised
with
a
constricted
hand
the
*NL*
curtain
of
a
window
overlooking
the
court-yard
.
He
remained
there
ten
*NL*
minutes
,
motionless
and
dumb
,
listening
to
the
beating
of
his
own
heart
.
*NL*
For
him
those
ten
minutes
were
very
long
.
It
was
then
Albert
,
returning
*NL*
from
his
meeting
with
the
count
,
perceived
his
father
watching
for
his
*NL*
arrival
behind
a
curtain
,
and
turned
aside
.
The
count
's
eye
expanded
;
he
*NL*
knew
Albert
had
insulted
the
count
dreadfully
,
and
that
in
every
country
*NL*
in
the
world
such
an
insult
would
lead
to
a
deadly
duel
.
Albert
returned
*NL*
safely
--
then
the
count
was
revenged
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
indescribable
ray
of
joy
illumined
that
wretched
countenance
like
the
*NL*
last
ray
of
the
sun
before
it
disappears
behind
the
clouds
which
bear
*NL*
the
aspect
,
not
of
a
downy
couch
,
but
of
a
tomb
.
But
as
we
have
said
,
he
*NL*
waited
in
vain
for
his
son
to
come
to
his
apartment
with
the
account
of
*NL*
his
triumph
.
He
easily
understood
why
his
son
did
not
come
to
see
him
*NL*
before
he
went
to
avenge
his
father
's
honor
;
but
when
that
was
done
,
why
*NL*
did
not
his
son
come
and
throw
himself
into
his
arms
?
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
then
,
when
the
count
could
not
see
Albert
,
that
he
sent
for
his
*NL*
servant
,
who
he
knew
was
authorized
not
to
conceal
anything
from
him
.
*NL*
Ten
minutes
afterwards
,
General
Morcerf
was
seen
on
the
steps
in
a
black
*NL*
coat
with
a
military
collar
,
black
pantaloons
,
and
black
gloves
.
He
had
*NL*
apparently
given
previous
orders
,
for
as
he
reached
the
bottom
step
his
*NL*
carriage
came
from
the
coach-house
ready
for
him
.
The
valet
threw
into
*NL*
the
carriage
his
military
cloak
,
in
which
two
swords
were
wrapped
,
and
,
*NL*
shutting
the
door
,
he
took
his
seat
by
the
side
of
the
coachman
.
The
*NL*
coachman
stooped
down
for
his
orders
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
the
Champs
Elysees
,
''
said
the
general
;
``
the
Count
of
Monte
Cristo
's
.
*NL*
Hurry
!
''
The
horses
bounded
beneath
the
whip
;
and
in
five
minutes
they
*NL*
stopped
before
the
count
's
door
.
M.
de
Morcerf
opened
the
door
himself
,
*NL*
and
as
the
carriage
rolled
away
he
passed
up
the
walk
,
rang
,
and
entered
*NL*
the
open
door
with
his
servant
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
moment
afterwards
,
Baptistin
announced
the
Count
of
Morcerf
to
Monte
*NL*
Cristo
,
and
the
latter
,
leading
Haidee
aside
,
ordered
that
Morcerf
be
*NL*
asked
into
the
drawing-room
.
The
general
was
pacing
the
room
the
third
*NL*
time
when
,
in
turning
,
he
perceived
Monte
Cristo
at
the
door
.
``
Ah
,
it
*NL*
is
M.
de
Morcerf
,
''
said
Monte
Cristo
quietly
;
``
I
thought
I
had
not
heard
*NL*
aright
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
is
I
,
''
said
the
count
,
whom
a
frightful
contraction
of
the
lips
*NL*
prevented
from
articulating
freely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
I
know
the
cause
which
procures
me
the
pleasure
of
seeing
M.
de
*NL*
Morcerf
so
early
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Had
you
not
a
meeting
with
my
son
this
morning
?
''
asked
the
general
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
,
''
replied
the
count
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
know
my

had
good
reasons
to
wish
to
fight
with
you
,
and
to
*NL*
endeavor
to
kill
you

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
,
he
had
very
good
ones
;
but
you
see
that
in
spite
of
them
he
*NL*
has
not
killed
me
,
and
did
not
even
fight
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yet
he
considered
you
the
cause
of
his
father
's
dishonor
,
the
cause
of
*NL*
the
fearful
ruin
which
has
fallen
on
my
house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
true
,
sir
,
''
said
Monte
Cristo
with
his
dreadful
calmness
;
``
a
*NL*
secondary
cause
,
but
not
the
principal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Doubtless
you
made
,
then
,
some
apology
or
explanation
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
explained
nothing
,
and
it
is
he
who
apologized
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
to
what
do
you
attribute
this
conduct
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
the
conviction
,
probably
,
that
there
was
one
more
guilty
than
I.

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
who
was
that
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
His
father

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
may
be
,

said
the
count
,
turning
pale
;
``
but
you
know
the
guilty

*NL*
not
like
to
find
themselves
convicted

*NL*
*NL*

I
know
it

I
expected
this
result

*NL*
``
You
expected

cried
the
count

*NL*
*NL*
``
M.
Albert
de
Morcerf

no

said
Monte

*NL*
``
A

sees
a
mortal

I
may
tell

so

*NL*
*NL*
``

Monte

coldly
,
``
I
did
not

your

Go

tell
M.

that

may
know
what
to
answer
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

no

no

said
the
general
,
smiling
faintly
,
``
I
did
not
come
for
*NL*
that
purpose

you
are
right

I
came
to
tell
you
that
I
also
look
upon
*NL*
you
as
my
enemy

I
came
to
tell
you
that
I
hate
you
instinctively
;
that
*NL*
it
seems
as
if
I
had
always
known
you
,
and
always
hated
you
;
and
,
in
*NL*
short
,
since
the
young
people
of
the
present

will
not
fight

it

remains
for
us
to
do
so

Do
you
think
so

*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly

And
when
I
told

I
alluded

You

the

whose
teeth
were
clinched
with
rage

``
Until

repeated
*NL*
Monte

,
moving
his
head
slightly
up
and
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
start
,
then
;
we
need
no
witnesses

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
true

said
Monte

;
``
it
is
unnecessary

so
well

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the

said
the
count
,
``
we
know
so
little
of

*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
?
''
said
Monte

,
with
the
same
indomitable
coolness
;
``
let
*NL*
us
see
.
Are
you
not
the
soldier
Fernand
who
deserted
on
the

of
Waterloo
?
Are

the
Lieutenant

Are

And
have

made
Lieutenant-General

Morcerf

peer
of
France

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
cried
the
general
,
as
if
branded
with
a
hot
iron
,
``
wretch
,
--
to
*NL*
reproach
me
with
my
shame
when
about
,
perhaps
,
to
kill
me

No

I
did
*NL*
not
say
I
was
a
stranger
to
you

I
know
well
,
demon
,
that
you
have
*NL*
penetrated
into
the
darkness
of
the
past

that
you
have
read

by
the
*NL*
light
of
what
torch
I
know
not

every
page
of
my
life
;

perhaps
I
*NL*
may
be
more
honorable
in
my

than
you
under
your
pompous

*NL*
No

no

I
am
aware
you
know
me

but
I
know
you
only
as
an
adventurer
*NL*
sewn
up
in
gold
and
jewellery

You
call
yourself
in
Paris
the
Count

Sinbad
the

*NL*
it
is
your
real

I
want
to
know
,
in
the
midst
of
your
hundred
names
,
*NL*
that
I
may
pronounce
it

*NL*
plunge
my

through
your
heart

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Count
of
Monte
Cristo
turned
dreadfully
pale
;
his
eye
seemed
to
*NL*
burn
with
a
devouring
fire
.
He
leaped
towards
a
dressing-room
near
his
*NL*
bedroom
,
and
in
less
than
a
moment
,
tearing
off
his
cravat
,
his
coat
*NL*
and
waistcoat
,
he
put
on
a
sailor
's
jacket
and
hat
,
from
beneath
which
*NL*
rolled
his
long
black
hair
.
He
returned
thus
,
formidable
and
implacable
,
*NL*
advancing
with
his
arms
crossed
on
his
breast
,
towards
the
general
,
*NL*
who
could
not
understand
why
he
had
disappeared
,
but
who
on
seeing
him
*NL*
again
,
and
feeling
his
teeth
chatter
and
his
legs
sink
under
him
,
drew
*NL*
back
,
and
only
stopped
when
he
found
a
table
to
support
his
clinched
*NL*
hand
.
``
Fernand
,
''
cried
he
,
``
of
my
hundred
names
I
need
only
tell
you
*NL*
one
,
to
overwhelm
you
!
But
you
guess
it
now
,
do
you
not
?
--
or
,
rather
,
*NL*
you
remember
it
?
For
,
notwithstanding
all
my
sorrows
and
my
tortures
,
*NL*
I
show
you
to-day
a
face
which
the
happiness
of
revenge
makes
young
*NL*
again
--
a
face
you
must
often
have
seen
in
your
dreams
since
your
*NL*
marriage
with
Mercedes
,
my
betrothed
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
general
,
with
his
head
thrown
back
,
hands
extended
,
gaze
fixed
,
*NL*
looked
silently
at
this
dreadful
apparition
;
then
seeking
the
wall
to
*NL*
support
him
,
he
glided
along
close
to
it
until
he
reached
the
door
,
*NL*
through
which
he
went
out
backwards
,
uttering
this
single
mournful
,
*NL*
lamentable
,
distressing
cry
,
--
``
Edmond
Dantes
!
''
Then
,
with
sighs
which
*NL*
were
unlike
any
human
sound
,
he
dragged
himself
to
the
door
,
reeled
*NL*
across
the
court-yard
,
and
falling
into
the
arms
of
his
valet
,
he
said
*NL*
in
a
voice
scarcely
intelligible
,
--
``
Home
,
home
.
''
The
fresh
air
and
the
*NL*
shame
he
felt
at
having
exposed
himself
before
his
servants
,
partly
*NL*
recalled
his
senses
,
but
the
ride
was
short
,
and
as
he
drew
near
his
*NL*
house
all
his
wretchedness
revived
.
He
stopped
at
a
short
distance
from
*NL*
the
house
and
alighted
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
door
was
wide
open
,
a
hackney-coach
was
standing
in
the
middle
of
*NL*
the
yard
--
a
strange
sight
before
so
noble
a
mansion
;
the
count
looked
*NL*
at
it
with
terror
,
but
without
daring
to
inquire
its
meaning
,
he
rushed
*NL*
towards
his
apartment
.
Two
persons
were
coming
down
the
stairs
;
he
had
*NL*
only
time
to
creep
into
an
alcove
to
avoid
them
.
It
was
Mercedes
leaning
*NL*
on
her
son
's
arm
and
leaving
the
house
.
They
passed
close
by
the
unhappy
*NL*
being
,
who
,
concealed
behind
the
damask
curtain
,
almost
felt
Mercedes
*NL*
dress
brush
past
him
,
and
his
son
's
warm
breath
,
pronouncing
these
*NL*
words
,
--
``
Courage
,
mother
!
Come
,
this
is
no
longer
our
home
!
''
The
words
*NL*
died
away
,
the
steps
were
lost
in
the
distance
.
The
general
drew
himself
*NL*
up
,
clinging
to
the
curtain
;
he
uttered
the
most
dreadful
sob
which
ever
*NL*
escaped
from
the
bosom
of
a
father
abandoned
at
the
same
time
by
*NL*
his
wife
and
son
.
He
soon
heard
the
clatter
of
the
iron
step
of
the
*NL*
hackney-coach
,
then
the
coachman
's
voice
,
and
then
the
rolling
of
the
*NL*
heavy
vehicle
shook
the
windows
.
He
darted
to
his
bedroom
to
see
once
*NL*
more
all
he
had
loved
in
the
world
;
but
the
hackney-coach
drove
on
and
*NL*
the
head
of
neither
Mercedes
nor
her
son
appeared
at
the
window
to
take
*NL*
a
last
look
at
the
house
or
the
deserted
father
and
husband
.
And
at
the
*NL*
very
moment
when
the
wheels
of
that
coach
crossed
the
gateway
a
report
*NL*
was
heard
,
and
a
thick
smoke
escaped
through
one
of
the
panes
of
the
*NL*
window
,
which
was
broken
by
the
explosion
.

Chapter
93
.
Valentine
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
may
easily
conceive
where
Morrel
's
appointment
was
.
On
leaving
Monte
*NL*
Cristo
he
walked
slowly
towards
Villefort
's
;
we
say
slowly
,
for
Morrel
*NL*
had
more
than
half
an
hour
to
spare
to
go
five
hundred
steps
,
but
he
*NL*
had
hastened
to
take
leave
of
Monte
Cristo
because
he
wished
to
be
alone
*NL*
with
his
thoughts
.
He
knew
his
time
well
--
the
hour
when
Valentine
was
*NL*
giving
Noirtier
his
breakfast
,
and
was
sure
not
to
be
disturbed
in
the
*NL*
performance
of
this
pious
duty
.
Noirtier
and
Valentine
had
given
him
*NL*
leave
to
go
twice
a
week
,
and
he
was
now
availing
himself
of
that
*NL*
permission
.
He
had
arrived
;
Valentine
was
expecting
him
.
Uneasy
and
*NL*
almost
crazed
,
she
seized
his
hand
and
led
him
to
her
grandfather
.
This
*NL*
uneasiness
,
amounting
almost
to
frenzy
,
arose
from
the
report
Morcerf
's
*NL*
adventure
had
made
in
the
world
,
for
the
affair
at
the
opera
was
*NL*
generally
known
.
No
one
at
Villefort
's
doubted
that
a
duel
would
ensue
*NL*
from
it
.
Valentine
,
with
her
woman
's
instinct
,
guessed
that
Morrel
would
*NL*
be
Monte
Cristo
's
second
,
and
from
the
young
man
's
well-known
courage
*NL*
and
his
great
affection
for
the
count
,
she
feared
that
he
would
not
*NL*
content
himself
with
the
passive
part
assigned
to
him
.
We
may
easily
*NL*
understand
how
eagerly
the
particulars
were
asked
for
,
given
,
and
*NL*
received
;
and
Morrel
could
read
an
indescribable
joy
in
the
eyes
of
his
*NL*
beloved
,
when
she
knew
that
the
termination
of
this
affair
was
as
happy
*NL*
as
it
was
unexpected
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
''
said
Valentine
,
motioning
to
Morrel
to
sit
down
near
her
*NL*
grandfather
,
while
she
took
her
seat
on
his
footstool
,
--
``
now
let
us
talk
*NL*
about
our
own
affairs
.
You
know
,
Maximilian
,
grandpapa
once
thought
*NL*
of
leaving
this
house
,
and
taking
an
apartment
away
from
M.
de
*NL*
Villefort
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Maximilian
,
``
I
recollect
the
project
,
of
which
I
highly
*NL*
approved
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Valentine
,
``
you
may
approve
again
,
for
grandpapa
is
again
*NL*
thinking
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bravo
,
''
said
Maximilian
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
do
you
know
,
''
said
Valentine
,
``
what
reason
grandpapa
gives
for
*NL*
leaving
this
house
.
''
Noirtier
looked
at
Valentine
to
impose
silence
,
*NL*
but
she
did
not
notice
him
;
her
looks
,
her
eyes
,
her
smile
,
were
all
for
*NL*
Morrel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
whatever
may
be
M.
Noirtier
's
reason
,
''
answered
Morrel
,
``
I
can
*NL*
readily
believe
it
to
be
a
good
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
excellent
one
,
''
said
Valentine
.
``
He
pretends
the
air
of
the
Faubourg
*NL*
St.
Honore
is
not
good
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
?
''
said
Morrel
;
``
in
that
M.
Noirtier
may
be
right
;
you
have
not
*NL*
seemed
to
be
well
for
the
last
fortnight
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
very
,
''
said
Valentine
.
``
And
grandpapa
has
become
my
physician
,
and
*NL*
I
have
the
greatest
confidence
in
him
,
because
he
knows
everything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
then
really
suffer
?
''
asked
Morrel
quickly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it
must
not
be
called
suffering
;
I
feel
a
general
uneasiness
,
that
*NL*
is
all
.
I
have
lost
my
appetite
,
and
my
stomach
feels
as
if
it
were
*NL*
struggling
to
get
accustomed
to
something
.
''
Noirtier
did
not
lose
a
*NL*
word
of
what
Valentine
said
.
``
And
what
treatment
do
you
adopt
for
this
*NL*
singular
complaint
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
very
simple
one
,
''
said
Valentine
.
``
I
swallow
every
morning
a
spoonful
*NL*
of
the
mixture
prepared
for
my
grandfather
.
When
I
say
one
spoonful
,
*NL*
I
began
by
one
--
now
I
take
four
.
Grandpapa
says
it
is
a
panacea
.
''
*NL*
Valentine
smiled
,
but
it
was
evident
that
she
suffered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Maximilian
,
in
his
devotedness
,
gazed
silently
at
her
.
She
was
very
*NL*
beautiful
,
but
her
usual
pallor
had
increased
;
her
eyes
were
more
*NL*
brilliant
than
ever
,
and
her
hands
,
which
were
generally
white
like
*NL*
mother-of-pearl
,
now
more
resembled
wax
,
to
which
time
was
adding
a
*NL*
yellowish
hue
.
From
Valentine
the
young
man
looked
towards
Noirtier
.
The
*NL*
latter
watched
with
strange
and
deep
interest
the
young
girl
,
absorbed
*NL*
by
her
affection
,
and
he
also
,
like
Morrel
,
followed
those
traces
of
*NL*
inward
suffering
which
was
so
little
perceptible
to
a
common
observer
*NL*
that
they
escaped
the
notice
of
every
one
but
the
grandfather
and
the
*NL*
lover
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
''
said
Morrel
,
``
I
thought
this
mixture
,
of
which
you
now
take
four
*NL*
spoonfuls
,
was
prepared
for
M.
Noirtier
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
it
is
very
bitter
,
''
said
Valentine
;
``
so
bitter
,
that
all
I
drink
*NL*
afterwards
appears
to
have
the
same
taste
.
''
Noirtier
looked
inquiringly
*NL*
at
his
granddaughter
.
``
Yes
,
grandpapa
,
''
said
Valentine
;
``
it
is
so
.
Just
*NL*
now
,
before
I
came
down
to
you
,
I
drank
a
glass
of
sugared
water
;
I
left
*NL*
half
,
because
it
seemed
so
bitter
.
''
Noirtier
turned
pale
,
and
made
a
*NL*
sign
that
he
wished
to
speak
.
Valentine
rose
to
fetch
the
dictionary
.
*NL*
Noirtier
watched
her
with
evident
anguish
.
In
fact
,
the
blood
was
*NL*
rushing
to
the
young
girl
's
head
already
,
her
cheeks
were
becoming
*NL*
red
.
``
Oh
,
''
cried
she
,
without
losing
any
of
her
cheerfulness
,
``
this
is
*NL*
singular
!
I
ca
n't
see
!
Did
the
sun
shine
in
my
eyes
?
''
And
she
leaned
*NL*
against
the
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
sun
is
not
shining
,
''
said
Morrel
,
more
alarmed
by
Noirtier
's
*NL*
expression
than
by
Valentine
's
indisposition
.
He
ran
towards
her
.
The
*NL*
young
girl
smiled
.
``
Cheer
up
,
''
said
she
to
Noirtier
.
``
Do
not
be
alarmed
,
*NL*
Maximilian
;
it
is
nothing
,
and
has
already
passed
away
.
But
listen
!
Do
I
*NL*
not
hear
a
carriage
in
the
court-yard
?
''
She
opened
Noirtier
's
door
,
ran
*NL*
to
a
window
in
the
passage
,
and
returned
hastily
.
``
Yes
,
''
said
she
,
*NL*
``
it
is
Madame
Danglars
and
her
daughter
,
who
have
come
to
call
on
us
.
*NL*
Good-by
;
--
I
must
run
away
,
for
they
would
send
here
for
me
,
or
,
rather
,
*NL*
farewell
till
I
see
you
again
.
Stay
with
grandpapa
,
Maximilian
;
I
*NL*
promise
you
not
to
persuade
them
to
stay
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Morrel
watched
her
as
she
left
the
room
;
he
heard
her
ascend
the
little
*NL*
staircase
which
led
both
to
Madame
de
Villefort
's
apartments
and
to
*NL*
hers
.
As
soon
as
she
was
gone
,
Noirtier
made
a
sign
to
Morrel
to
take
*NL*
the
dictionary
.
Morrel
obeyed
;
guided
by
Valentine
,
he
had
learned
how
*NL*
to
understand
the
old
man
quickly
.
Accustomed
,
however
,
as
he
was
to
the
*NL*
work
,
he
had
to
repeat
most
of
the
letters
of
the
alphabet
and
to
find
*NL*
every
word
in
the
dictionary
,
so
that
it
was
ten
minutes
before
the
*NL*
thought
of
the
old
man
was
translated
by
these
words
,
``
Fetch
the
glass
*NL*
of
water
and
the
decanter
from
Valentine
's
room
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Morrel
rang
immediately
for
the
servant
who
had
taken
Barrois
's
*NL*
situation
,
and
in
Noirtier
's
name
gave
that
order
.
The
servant
soon
*NL*
returned
.
The
decanter
and
the
glass
were
completely
empty
.
Noirtier
*NL*
made
a
sign
that
he
wished
to
speak
.
``
Why
are
the
glass
and
decanter
*NL*
empty
?
''
asked
he
;
``
Valentine
said
she
only
drank
half
the
glassful
.
''
The
*NL*
translation
of
this
new
question
occupied
another
five
minutes
.
``
I
*NL*
do
not
know
,
''
said
the
servant
,
``
but
the
housemaid
is
in
Mademoiselle
*NL*
Valentine
's
room
:
perhaps
she
has
emptied
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ask
her
,
''
said
Morrel
,
translating
Noirtier
's
thought
this
time
by
*NL*
his
look
.
The
servant
went
out
,
but
returned
almost
immediately
.
*NL*
``
Mademoiselle
Valentine
passed
through
the
room
to
go
to
Madame
de
*NL*
Villefort
's
,
''
said
he
;
``
and
in
passing
,
as
she
was
thirsty
,
she
drank
*NL*
what
remained
in
the
glass
;
as
for
the
decanter
,
Master
Edward
had
*NL*
emptied
that
to
make
a
pond
for
his
ducks
.
''
Noirtier
raised
his
eyes
to
*NL*
heaven
,
as
a
gambler
does
who
stakes
his
all
on
one
stroke
.
From
that
*NL*
moment
the
old
man
's
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
door
,
and
did
not
quit
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
indeed
Madame
Danglars
and
her
daughter
whom
Valentine
had
seen
;
*NL*
they
had
been
ushered
into
Madame
de
Villefort
's
room
,
who
had
said
she
*NL*
would
receive
them
there
.
That
is
why
Valentine
passed
through
her
room
,
*NL*
which
was
on
a
level
with
Valentine
's
,
and
only
separated
from
it
by
*NL*
Edward
's
.
The
two
ladies
entered
the
drawing-room
with
that
sort
of
*NL*
official
stiffness
which
preludes
a
formal
communication
.
Among
worldly
*NL*
people
manner
is
contagious
.
Madame
de
Villefort
received
them
with
*NL*
equal
solemnity
.
Valentine
entered
at
this
moment
,
and
the
formalities
*NL*
were
resumed
.
``
My
dear
friend
,
''
said
the
baroness
,
while
the
two
young
*NL*
people
were
shaking
hands
,
``
I
and
Eugenie
are
come
to
be
the
first
to
*NL*
announce
to
you
the
approaching
marriage
of
my
daughter
with
Prince
*NL*
Cavalcanti
.
''
Danglars
kept
up
the
title
of
prince
.
The
popular
banker
*NL*
found
that
it
answered
better
than
count
.
``
Allow
me
to
present
you
*NL*
my
sincere
congratulations
,
''
replied
Madame
de
Villefort
.
``
Prince
*NL*
Cavalcanti
appears
to
be
a
young
man
of
rare
qualities
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
,
''
said
the
baroness
,
smiling
;
``
speaking
to
you
as
a
friend
I
can
*NL*
say
that
the
prince
does
not
yet
appear
all
he
will
be
.
He
has
about
him
*NL*
a
little
of
that
foreign
manner
by
which
French
persons
recognize
,
at
*NL*
first
sight
,
the
Italian
or
German
nobleman
.
Besides
,
he
gives
evidence
*NL*
of
great
kindness
of
disposition
,
much
keenness
of
wit
,
and
as
to
*NL*
suitability
,
M.
Danglars
assures
me
that
his
fortune
is
majestic
--
that
*NL*
is
his
word
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
then
,
''
said
Eugenie
,
while
turning
over
the
leaves
of
Madame
de
*NL*
Villefort
's
album
,
``
add
that
you
have
taken
a
great
fancy
to
the
young
*NL*
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
,
''
said
Madame
de
Villefort
,
``
I
need
not
ask
you
if
you
share
that
*NL*
fancy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
?
''
replied
Eugenie
with
her
usual
candor
.
``
Oh
,
not
the
least
in
the
*NL*
world
,
madame
!
My
wish
was
not
to
confine
myself
to
domestic
cares
,
or
*NL*
the
caprices
of
any
man
,
but
to
be
an
artist
,
and
consequently
free
in
*NL*
heart
,
in
person
,
and
in
thought
.
''
Eugenie
pronounced
these
words
with
*NL*
so
firm
a
tone
that
the
color
mounted
to
Valentine
's
cheeks
.
The
timid
*NL*
girl
could
not
understand
that
vigorous
nature
which
appeared
to
have
*NL*
none
of
the
timidities
of
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
any
rate
,
''
said
she
,
``
since
I
am
to
be
married
whether
I
will
or
*NL*
not
,
I
ought
to
be
thankful
to
providence
for
having
released
me
from
my
*NL*
engagement
with
M.
Albert
de
Morcerf
,
or
I
should
this
day
have
been
the
*NL*
wife
of
a
dishonored
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
true
,
''
said
the
baroness
,
with
that
strange
simplicity
sometimes
*NL*
met
with
among
fashionable
ladies
,
and
of
which
plebeian
intercourse
can
*NL*
never
entirely
deprive
them
,
--
``
it
is
very
true
that
had
not
the
Morcerfs
*NL*
hesitated
,
my
daughter
would
have
married
Monsieur
Albert
.
The
general
*NL*
depended
much
on
it
;
he
even
came
to
force
M.
Danglars
.
We
have
had
a
*NL*
narrow
escape
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
''
said
Valentine
,
timidly
,
``
does
all
the
father
's
shame
revert
upon
*NL*
the
son
?
Monsieur
Albert
appears
to
me
quite
innocent
of
the
treason
*NL*
charged
against
the
general
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excuse
me
,
''
said
the
implacable
young
girl
,
``
Monsieur
Albert
claims
and
*NL*
well
deserves
his
share
.
It
appears
that
after
having
challenged
M.
*NL*
de
Monte
Cristo
at
the
Opera
yesterday
,
he
apologized
on
the
ground
*NL*
to-day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Impossible
,
''
said
Madame
de
Villefort
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
my
dear
friend
,
''
said
Madame
Danglars
,
with
the
same
simplicity
*NL*
we
before
noticed
,
``
it
is
a
fact
.
I
heard
it
from
M.
Debray
,
who
was
*NL*
present
at
the
explanation
.
''
Valentine
also
knew
the
truth
,
but
she
did
*NL*
not
answer
.
A
single
word
had
reminded
her
that
Morrel
was
expecting
*NL*
her
in
M.
Noirtier
's
room
.
Deeply
engaged
with
a
sort
of
inward
*NL*
contemplation
,
Valentine
had
ceased
for
a
moment
to
join
in
the
*NL*
conversation
.
She
would
,
indeed
,
have
found
it
impossible
to
repeat
what
*NL*
had
been
said
the
last
few
minutes
,
when
suddenly
Madame
Danglars
'
hand
,
*NL*
pressed
on
her
arm
,
aroused
her
from
her
lethargy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
said
she
,
starting
at
Madame
Danglars
'
touch
as
she
would
*NL*
have
done
from
an
electric
shock
.
``
It
is
,
my
dear
Valentine
,
''
said
the
*NL*
baroness
,
``
that
you
are
,
doubtless
,
suffering
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
?
''
said
the
young
girl
,
passing
her
hand
across
her
burning
forehead
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
look
at
yourself
in
that
glass
;
you
have
turned
pale
and
then
red
*NL*
successively
,
three
or
four
times
in
one
minute
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
''
cried
Eugenie
,
``
you
are
very
pale
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
do
not
be
alarmed
;
I
have
been
so
for
many
days
.
''
Artless
as
she
*NL*
was
,
the
young
girl
knew
that
this
was
an
opportunity
to
leave
,
*NL*
and
besides
,
Madame
de
Villefort
came
to
her
assistance
.
``
Retire
,
*NL*
Valentine
,
''
said
she
;
``
you
are
really
suffering
,
and
these
ladies
will
*NL*
excuse
you
;
drink
a
glass
of
pure
water
,
it
will
restore
you
.
''
Valentine
*NL*
kissed
Eugenie
,
bowed
to
Madame
Danglars
,
who
had
already
risen
to
take
*NL*
her
leave
,
and
went
out
.
``
That
poor
child
,
''
said
Madame
de
Villefort
*NL*
when
Valentine
was
gone
,
``
she
makes
me
very
uneasy
,
and
I
should
not
be
*NL*
astonished
if
she
had
some
serious
illness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
Valentine
,
in
a
sort
of
excitement
which
she
could
not
quite
*NL*
understand
,
had
crossed
Edward
's
room
without
noticing
some
trick
of
*NL*
the
child
,
and
through
her
own
had
reached
the
little
staircase
.
She
was
*NL*
within
three
steps
of
the
bottom
;
she
already
heard
Morrel
's
voice
,
when
*NL*
suddenly
a
cloud
passed
over
her
eyes
,
her
stiffened
foot
missed
the
*NL*
step
,
her
hands
had
no
power
to
hold
the
baluster
,
and
falling
against
*NL*
the
wall
she
lost
her
balance
wholly
and
toppled
to
the
floor
.
Morrel
*NL*
bounded
to
the
door
,
opened
it
,
and
found
Valentine
stretched
out
at
the
*NL*
bottom
of
the
stairs
.
Quick
as
a
flash
,
he
raised
her
in
his
arms
and
*NL*
placed
her
in
a
chair
.
Valentine
opened
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
what
a
clumsy
thing
I
am
,
''
said
she
with
feverish
volubility
;
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
my
way
.
I
forgot
there
were
three
more
steps
before
the
*NL*
landing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
hurt
yourself
,
perhaps
,
''
said
Morrel
.
``
What
can
I
do
for
you
,
*NL*
Valentine
?
''
Valentine
looked
around
her
;
she
saw
the
deepest
terror
*NL*
depicted
in
Noirtier
's
eyes
.
``
Do
n't
worry
,
dear
grandpapa
,
''
said
she
,
*NL*
endeavoring
to
smile
;
``
it
is
nothing
--
it
is
nothing
;
I
was
giddy
,
that
*NL*
is
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Another
attack
of
giddiness
,
''
said
Morrel
,
clasping
his
hands
.
``
Oh
,
*NL*
attend
to
it
,
Valentine
,
I
entreat
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
no
,
''
said
Valentine
,
--
``
no
,
I
tell
you
it
is
all
past
,
and
it
was
*NL*
nothing
.
Now
,
let
me
tell
you
some
news
;
Eugenie
is
to
be
married
in
*NL*
a
week
,
and
in
three
days
there
is
to
be
a
grand
feast
,
a
betrothal
*NL*
festival
.
We
are
all
invited
,
my
father
,
Madame
de
Villefort
,
and
I
--
at
*NL*
least
,
I
understood
it
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
will
it
be
our
turn
to
think
of
these
things
?
Oh
,
Valentine
,
*NL*
you
who
have
so
much
influence
over
your
grandpapa
,
try
to
make
him
*NL*
answer
--
Soon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
do
you
,
''
said
Valentine
,
``
depend
on
me
to
stimulate
the
tardiness
*NL*
and
arouse
the
memory
of
grandpapa
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
cried
Morrel
,
``
make
haste
.
So
long
as
you
are
not
mine
,
*NL*
Valentine
,
I
shall
always
think
I
may
lose
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
replied
Valentine
with
a
convulsive
movement
,
``
oh
,
indeed
,
*NL*
Maximilian
,
you
are
too
timid
for
an
officer
,
for
a
soldier
who
,
*NL*
they
say
,
never
knows
fear
.
Ah
,
ha
,
ha
!
''
she
burst
into
a
forced
and
*NL*
melancholy
laugh
,
her
arms
stiffened
and
twisted
,
her
head
fell
back
*NL*
on
her
chair
,
and
she
remained
motionless
.
The
cry
of
terror
which
*NL*
was
stopped
on
Noirtier
's
lips
,
seemed
to
start
from
his
eyes
.
Morrel
*NL*
understood
it
;
he
knew
he
must
call
assistance
.
The
young
man
rang
the
*NL*
bell
violently
;
the
housemaid
who
had
been
in
Mademoiselle
Valentine
's
*NL*
room
,
and
the
servant
who
had
replaced
Barrois
,
ran
in
at
the
same
*NL*
moment
.
Valentine
was
so
pale
,
so
cold
,
so
inanimate
that
without
*NL*
listening
to
what
was
said
to
them
they
were
seized
with
the
fear
which
*NL*
pervaded
that
house
,
and
they
flew
into
the
passage
crying
for
help
.
*NL*
Madame
Danglars
and
Eugenie
were
going
out
at
that
moment
;
they
heard
*NL*
the
cause
of
the
disturbance
.
``
I
told
you
so
!
''
exclaimed
Madame
de
*NL*
Villefort
.
``
Poor
child
!

*NL*
*NL*
At
the
same
moment
M.
de
Villefort
's
voice
was
heard
calling
from
his
*NL*
study
,
``
What
is
the
matter
?
''
Morrel
looked
at
Noirtier
who
had
recovered
*NL*
his
self-command
,
and
with
a
glance
indicated
the
closet
where
once
*NL*
before
under
somewhat
similar
circumstances
,
he
had
taken
refuge
.
He
had
*NL*
only
time
to
get
his
hat
and
throw
himself
breathless
into
the
closet
*NL*
when
the
procureur
's
footstep
was
heard
in
the
passage
.
Villefort
sprang
*NL*
into
the
room
,
ran
to
Valentine
,
and
took
her
in
his
arms
.
``
A
physician
,
*NL*
a
physician
,
--
M.
d'Avrigny
!
''
cried
Villefort
;
``
or
rather
I
will
go
for
*NL*
him
myself
.
''
He
flew
from
the
apartment
,
and
Morrel
at
the
same
moment
*NL*
darted
out
at
the
other
door
.
He
had
been
struck
to
the
heart
by
a
*NL*
frightful
recollection
--
the
conversation
he
had
heard
between
the
doctor
*NL*
and
Villefort
the
night
of
Madame
de
Saint-Meran
's
death
,
recurred
to
*NL*
him
;
these
symptoms
,
to
a
less
alarming
extent
,
were
the
same
which
had
*NL*
preceded
the
death
of
Barrois
.
At
the
same
time
Monte
Cristo
's
voice
*NL*
seemed
to
resound
in
his
ear
with
the
words
he
had
heard
only
two
hours
*NL*
before
,
``
Whatever
you
want
,
Morrel
,
come
to
me
;
I
have
great
power
.
''
*NL*
More
rapidly
than
thought
,
he
darted
down
the
Rue
Matignon
,
and
thence
*NL*
to
the
Avenue
des
Champs
Elysees
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
M.
de
Villefort
arrived
in
a
hired
cabriolet
at
M.
d'Avrigny
's
*NL*
door
.
He
rang
so
violently
that
the
porter
was
alarmed
.
Villefort
ran
*NL*
up-stairs
without
saying
a
word
.
The
porter
knew
him
,
and
let
him
pass
,
*NL*
only
calling
to
him
,
``
In
his
study
,
Monsieur
Procureur
--
in
his
study
!
''
*NL*
Villefort
pushed
,
or
rather
forced
,
the
door
open
.
``
Ah
,
''
said
the
*NL*
doctor
,
``
is
it
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Villefort
,
closing
the
door
after
him
,
``
it
is
I
,
who
am
*NL*
come
in
my
turn
to
ask
you
if
we
are
quite
alone
.
Doctor
,
my
house
is
*NL*
accursed
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
said
the
latter
with
apparent
coolness
,
but
with
deep
emotion
,
*NL*
``
have
you
another
invalid
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
doctor
,
''
cried
Villefort
,
clutching
his
hair
,
``
yes
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
D'Avrigny
's
look
implied
,
``
I
told
you
it
would
be
so
.
''
Then
he
slowly
*NL*
uttered
these
words
,
``
Who
is
now
dying
in
your
house
?
What
new
victim
is
*NL*
going
to
accuse
you
of
weakness
before
God
?
''
A
mournful
sob
burst
*NL*
from
Villefort
's
heart
;
he
approached
the
doctor
,
and
seizing
his
*NL*
arm
,
--
``
Valentine
,
''
said
he
,
``
it
is
Valentine
's
turn
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
daughter
?
''
cried
d'Avrigny
with
grief
and
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
you
were
deceived
,
''
murmured
the
magistrate
;
``
come
and
see
her
,
*NL*
and
on
her
bed
of
agony
entreat
her
pardon
for
having
suspected
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Each
time
you
have
applied
to
me
,
''
said
the
doctor
,
``
it
has
been
too
*NL*
late
;
still
I
will
go
.
But
let
us
make
haste
,
sir
;
with
the
enemies
you
*NL*
have
to
do
with
there
is
no
time
to
be
lost
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
this
time
,
doctor
,
you
shall
not
have
to
reproach
me
with
weakness
.
*NL*
This
time
I
will
know
the
assassin
,
and
will
pursue
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
try
first
to
save
the
victim
before
we
think
of
revenging
her
,
''
*NL*
said
d'Avrigny
.
``
Come
.
''
The
same
cabriolet
which
had
brought
Villefort
*NL*
took
them
back
at
full
speed
,
and
at
this
moment
Morrel
rapped
at
Monte
*NL*
Cristo
's
door
.
The
count
was
in
his
study
and
was
reading
with
an
angry
*NL*
look
something
which
Bertuccio
had
brought
in
haste
.
Hearing
the
name
*NL*
of
Morrel
,
who
had
left
him
only
two
hours
before
,
the
count
raised
his
*NL*
head
,
arose
,
and
sprang
to
meet
him
.
``
What
is
the
matter
,
Maximilian
?
''
*NL*
asked
he
;
``
you
are
pale
,
and
the
perspiration
rolls
from
your
forehead
.
''
*NL*
Morrel
fell
into
a
chair
.
``
Yes
,
''
said
he
,
``
I
came
quickly
;
I
wanted
to
*NL*
speak
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
all
your
family
well
?
''
asked
the
count
,
with
an
affectionate
*NL*
benevolence
,
whose
sincerity
no
one
could
for
a
moment
doubt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
count
--
thank
you
,
''
said
the
young
man
,
evidently
embarrassed
*NL*
how
to
begin
the
conversation
;
``
yes
,
every
one
in
my
family
is
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
much
the
better
;
yet
you
have
something
to
tell
me
?
''
replied
the
*NL*
count
with
increased
anxiety
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Morrel
,
``
it
is
true
;
I
have
but
now
left
a
house
where
death
*NL*
has
just
entered
,
to
run
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
then
come
from
M.
de
Morcerf
's
?
''
asked
Monte
Cristo
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Morrel
;
``
is
some
one
dead
in
his
house
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
general
has
just
blown
his
brains
out
,
''
replied
Monte
Cristo
with
*NL*
great
coolness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
what
a
dreadful
event
!
''
cried
Maximilian
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
for
the
countess
,
or
for
Albert
,
''
said
Monte
Cristo
;
``
a
dead
father
*NL*
or
husband
is
better
than
a
dishonored
one
,
--
blood
washes
out
shame
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
countess
,
''
said
Maximilian
,
``
I
pity
her
very
much
;
she
is
so
noble
*NL*
a
woman
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pity
Albert
also
,
Maximilian
;
for
believe
me
he
is
the
worthy
son
*NL*
of
the
countess
.
But
let
us
return
to
yourself
.
You
have
hastened
to
*NL*
me
--
can
I
have
the
happiness
of
being
useful
to
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
need
your
help
:
that
is
I
thought
like
a
madman
that
you
could
*NL*
lend
me
your
assistance
in
a
case
where
God
alone
can
succor
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
what
it
is
,
''
replied
Monte
Cristo
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
said
Morrel
,
``
I
know
not
,
indeed
,
if
I
may
reveal
this
secret
*NL*
to
mortal
ears
,
but
fatality
impels
me
,
necessity
constrains
me
,
*NL*
count
''
--
Morrel
hesitated
.
``
Do
you
think
I
love
you
?
''
said
Monte
Cristo
,
*NL*
taking
the
young
man
's
hand
affectionately
in
his
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
encourage
me
,
and
something
tells
me
there
,
''
placing
his
hand
*NL*
on
his
heart
,
``
that
I
ought
to
have
no
secret
from
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
right
,
Morrel
;
God
is
speaking
to
your
heart
,
and
your
heart
*NL*
speaks
to
you
.
Tell
me
what
it
says
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Count
,
will
you
allow
me
to
send
Baptistin
to
inquire
after
some
one
*NL*
you
know
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
at
your
service
,
and
still
more
my
servants
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
can
not
live
if
she
is
not
better

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
I
ring
for
Baptistin
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
will
go
and
speak
to
him
myself
.
''
Morrel
went
out
,
called
*NL*
Baptistin
,
and
whispered
a
few
words
to
him
.
The
valet
ran
directly
.
*NL*
``
Well
,
have
you
sent
?
''
asked
Monte
Cristo
,
seeing
Morrel
return
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
and
now
I
shall
be
more
calm
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
I
am
waiting
,
''
said
Monte
Cristo
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
and
I
will
tell
you
.
One
evening
I
was
in
a
garden
;
a
clump
of
*NL*
trees
concealed
me
;
no
one
suspected
I
was
there
.
Two
persons
passed
*NL*
near
me
--
allow
me
to
conceal
their
names
for
the
present
;
they
were
*NL*
speaking
in
an
undertone
,
and
yet
I
was
so
interested
in
what
they
said
*NL*
that
I
did
not
lose
a
single
word
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
a
gloomy
introduction
,
if
I
may
judge
from
your
pallor
and
*NL*
shuddering
,
Morrel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
very
gloomy
,
my
friend
.
Some
one
had
just
died
in
the
house
*NL*
to
which
that
garden
belonged
.
One
of
the
persons
whose
conversation
*NL*
I
overheard
was
the
master
of
the
house
;
the
other
,
the
physician
.
The
*NL*
former
was
confiding
to
the
latter
his
grief
and
fear
,
for
it
was
the
*NL*
second
time
within
a
month
that
death
had
suddenly
and
unexpectedly
*NL*
entered
that
house
which
was
apparently
destined
to
destruction
by
some
*NL*
exterminating
angel
,
as
an
object
of
God
's
anger
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
indeed
?
''
said
Monte
Cristo
,
looking
earnestly
at
the
young
man
,
and
*NL*
by
an
imperceptible
movement
turning
his
chair
,
so
that
he
remained
*NL*
in
the
shade
while
the
light
fell
full
on
Maximilian
's
face
.
``
Yes
,
''
*NL*
continued
Morrel
,
``
death
had
entered
that
house
twice
within
one
month
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
did
the
doctor
answer
?
''
asked
Monte
Cristo
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
replied
--
he
replied
,
that
the
death
was
not
a
natural
one
,
and
must
*NL*
be
attributed
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
poison
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
?
''
said
Monte
Cristo
with
a
slight
cough
which
in
moments
of
*NL*
extreme
emotion
helped
him
to
disguise
a
blush
,
or
his
pallor
,
or
the
*NL*
intense
interest
with
which
he
listened
;
``
indeed
,
Maximilian
,
did
you
*NL*
hear
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
my
dear
count
,
I
heard
it
;
and
the
doctor
added
that
if
another
*NL*
death
occurred
in
a
similar
way
he
must
appeal
to
justice
.
''
Monte
Cristo
*NL*
listened
,
or
appeared
to
do
so
,
with
the
greatest
calmness
.
``
Well
,
''
*NL*
said
Maximilian
,
``
death
came
a
third
time
,
and
neither
the
master
of
*NL*
the
house
nor
the
doctor
said
a
word
.
Death
is
now
,
perhaps
,
striking
a
*NL*
fourth
blow
.
Count
,
what
am
I
bound
to
do
,
being
in
possession
of
this
*NL*
secret
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
friend
,
''
said
Monte
Cristo
,
``
you
appear
to
be
relating
an
*NL*
adventure
which
we
all
know
by
heart
.
I
know
the
house
where
you
heard
*NL*
it
,
or
one
very
similar
to
it
;
a
house
with
a
garden
,
a
master
,
a
*NL*
physician
,
and
where
there
have
been
three
unexpected
and
sudden
deaths
.
*NL*
Well
,
I
have
not
intercepted
your
confidence
,
and
yet
I
know
all
that
*NL*
as
well
as
you
,
and
I
have
no
conscientious
scruples
.
No
,
it
does
not
*NL*
concern
me
.
You
say
an
exterminating
angel
appears
to
have
devoted
that
*NL*
house
to
God
's
anger
--
well
,
who
says
your
supposition
is
not
reality
?
*NL*
Do
not
notice
things
which
those
whose
interest
it
is
to
see
them
pass
*NL*
over
.
If
it
is
God
's
justice
,
instead
of
his
anger
,
which
is
walking
*NL*
through
that
house
,
Maximilian
,
turn
away
your
face
and
let
his
justice
*NL*
accomplish
its
purpose
.
''
Morrel
shuddered
.
There
was
something
mournful
,
*NL*
solemn
,
and
terrible
in
the
count
's
manner
.
``
Besides
,
''
continued
he
,
in
*NL*
so
changed
a
tone
that
no
one
would
have
supposed
it
was
the
same
person
*NL*
speaking
--
``
besides
,
who
says
that
it
will
begin
again
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
has
returned
,
count
,
''
exclaimed
Morrel
;
``
that
is
why
I
hastened
to
*NL*
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
do
you
wish
me
to
do
?
Do
you
wish
me
,
for
instance
,
to
give
*NL*
information
to
the
procureur
?
''
Monte
Cristo
uttered
the
last
words
with
*NL*
so
much
meaning
that
Morrel
,
starting
up
,
cried
out
,
``
You
know
of

I
*NL*
speak

do
you
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perfectly
well

I
will
prove
it
to
you
by
putting
*NL*
the
dots
to
the
`

'
or
rather
by
naming
the
persons
.
You
were
walking
*NL*
one
evening
in
M.
de
Villefort
's
garden
;
from
what
you
relate
,
I
suppose
*NL*
it
to
have
been
the
evening
of
Madame
de
Saint-Meran
's
death

You
*NL*
heard
M.
de
Villefort
talking
to
M.
d'Avrigny
about
the
death
of
M.
de
*NL*
Saint-Meran
,
and
that
no
less
surprising
,
of
the
countess
.
M.
d'Avrigny
*NL*
said
he
believed
they
both
proceeded
from
poison
;
and
you
,
honest
man
,
*NL*
have
ever
since
been
asking
your
heart
and
sounding
your
conscience
to
*NL*
know
if
you
ought
to
expose
or
conceal
this
secret
.
Why
do
you
torment
*NL*
them
?
`
Conscience
,
what
hast
thou
to
do
with
me
?
'
as
Sterne
said
.
My
*NL*
dear
fellow
,
let
them
sleep
on
,
if
they
are
asleep
;
let
them
grow
pale
*NL*
in
their
drowsiness
,
if
they
are
disposed
to
do
so
,
and
pray
do
you
*NL*
remain
in
peace
,
who
have
no
remorse
to
disturb
you
.
''
Deep
grief
was
*NL*
depicted
on
Morrel
's
features
;
he
seized
Monte
Cristo
's
hand
.
``
But
it
is
*NL*
beginning
again
,
I
say
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
the
Count
,
astonished
at
his
perseverance
,
which
he
could
*NL*
not
understand
,
and
looking
still
more
earnestly
at
Maximilian
,
``
let
it
*NL*
begin
again
,
--
it
is
like
the
house
of
the
Atreidae
;
-LSB-
*
-RSB-
God
has
condemned
*NL*
them
,
and
they
must
submit
to
their
punishment
.
They
will
all
disappear
,
*NL*
like
the
fabrics
children
build
with
cards
,
and
which
fall
,
one
by
one
,
*NL*
under
the
breath
of
their
builder
,
even
if
there
are
two
hundred
of
*NL*
them
.
Three
months
since
it
was
M.
de
Saint-Meran
;
Madame
de
Saint-Meran
*NL*
two
months
since
;
the
other
day
it
was
Barrois
;
to-day
,
the
old
*NL*
Noirtier
,
or
young
Valentine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*
In
the
old
Greek
legend
the
Atreidae
,
or
children
of
*NL*
Atreus
,
were
doomed
to
punishment
because
of
the
abominable
*NL*
crime
of
their
father
.
The
Agamemnon
of
Aeschylus
is
based
*NL*
on
this
legend
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
knew
it
?
''
cried
Morrel
,
in
such
a
paroxysm
of
terror
that
Monte
*NL*
Cristo
started
,
--
he
whom
the
falling
heavens
would
have
found
unmoved
;
*NL*
``
you
knew
it
,
and
said
nothing
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
is
it
to
me
?
''
replied
Monte
Cristo
,
shrugging
his
shoulders
;
*NL*
``
do
I
know
those
people
?
and
must
I
lose
the
one
to
save
the
other
?
*NL*
Faith
,
no
,
for
between
the
culprit
and
the
victim
I
have
no
choice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
,
''
cried
Morrel
,
groaning
with
sorrow
,
``
I
love
her
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
love
?
--
whom
?
''
cried
Monte
Cristo
,
starting
to
his
feet
,
and
seizing
*NL*
the
two
hands
which
Morrel
was
raising
towards
heaven
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
love
most
fondly
--
I
love
madly
--
I
love
as
a
man
who
would
give
his
*NL*
life-blood
to
spare
her
a
tear
--
I
love
Valentine
de
Villefort
,
who
is
*NL*
being
murdered
at
this
moment
!
Do
you
understand
me
?
I
love
her
;
and
I
*NL*
ask
God
and
you
how
I
can
save
her
?
''
Monte
Cristo
uttered
a
cry
which
*NL*
those
only
can
conceive
who
have
heard
the
roar
of
a
wounded
lion
.
*NL*
``
Unhappy
man
,
''
cried
he
,
wringing
his
hands
in
his
turn
;
``
you
love
*NL*
Valentine
,
--
that
daughter
of
an
accursed
race
!
''
Never
had
Morrel
*NL*
witnessed
such
an
expression
--
never
had
so
terrible
an
eye
flashed
*NL*
before
his
face
--
never
had
the
genius
of
terror
he
had
so
often
seen
,
*NL*
either
on
the
battle-field
or
in
the
murderous
nights
of
Algeria
,
shaken
*NL*
around
him
more
dreadful
fire
.
He
drew
back
terrified
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
Monte
Cristo
,
after
this
ebullition
he
closed
his
eyes
as
*NL*
if
dazzled
by
internal
light
.
In
a
moment
he
restrained
himself
so
*NL*
powerfully
that
the
tempestuous
heaving
of
his
breast
subsided
,
as
*NL*
turbulent
and
foaming
waves
yield
to
the
sun
's
genial
influence
when
the
*NL*
cloud
has
passed
.
This
silence
,
self-control
,
and
struggle
lasted
about
*NL*
twenty
seconds
,
then
the
count
raised
his
pallid
face
.
``
See
,
''
said
he
,
*NL*
``
my
dear
friend
,
how
God
punishes
the
most
thoughtless
and
unfeeling
men
*NL*
for
their
indifference

by
presenting
dreadful
scenes
to
their
view

I

*NL*
who
was
looking
on

an
eager
and
curious
spectator

--
I
,
who
was
watching
*NL*
the
working
of
this
mournful
tragedy
,
--
I
,
who
like
a
wicked
angel
was
*NL*
laughing
at
the
evil
men
committed
protected
by
secrecy
-LRB-

secret
is
*NL*
easily
kept
by
the
rich

powerful
-RRB-

I
am
in
my
turn
bitten
by
the
*NL*
serpent
whose
tortuous
course
I
was
watching

and
bitten
to
the
heart

''
*NL*
*NL*
Morrel
groaned
.
``
Come
,
come
,
''
continued
the
count
,
``
complaints
are
*NL*
unavailing
,
be
a
man

be
strong
,
be
full
of
hope
,
for
I
am
here
and
will
*NL*
watch
over
you
.
''
Morrel
shook
his
head
sorrowfully
.
``
I
tell
you
to
*NL*
hope
.
Do
you
understand
me
?
''
cried
Monte
Cristo
.
``
Remember
that
I
*NL*
never
uttered
a
falsehood
and
am
never
deceived
.
It
is
twelve
o'clock
,
*NL*
Maximilian
;
thank
heaven
that
you
came
at
noon
rather
than
in
the
*NL*
evening
,
or
to-morrow
morning
.
Listen
,
Morrel
--
it
is
noon
;
if
Valentine
*NL*
is
not
now
dead
,
she
will
not
die
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
so
?
''
cried
Morrel
,
``
when
I
left
her
dying
?
''
Monte
Cristo
pressed
*NL*
his
hands
to
his
forehead
.
What
was
passing
in
that
brain
,
so
loaded
*NL*
with
dreadful
secrets
?
What
does
the
angel
of
light
or
the
angel
of
*NL*
darkness
say
to
that
mind
,
at
once
implacable
and
generous
?
God
only
*NL*
knows
.
*NL*
*NL*
Monte
Cristo
raised
his
head
once
more
,
and
this
time
he
was
calm
as
*NL*
a
child
awaking
from
its
sleep
.
``
Maximilian
,
''
said
he
,
``
return
home
.
I
*NL*
command
you
not
to
stir
--
attempt
nothing

not
to
let
your
countenance
*NL*
betray
a
thought
,
and
I
will
send
you
tidings
.
Go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
count
,
you
overwhelm
me
with
that
coolness
.
Have
you
,
then
,
power
*NL*
against
death
?
Are
you
superhuman
?
Are
you
an
angel
?
''
And
the
young
*NL*
man
,
who
had
never
shrunk
from
danger
,
shrank
before
Monte
Cristo
with
*NL*
indescribable
terror
.
But
Monte
Cristo
looked
at
him
with
so
melancholy
*NL*
and
sweet
a
smile
,
that
Maximilian
felt
the
tears
filling
his
eyes
.
*NL*
``
I
can
do
much
for
you
,
my
friend
,
''
replied
the
count
.
``
Go
;
I
must
be
*NL*
alone
.
''
Morrel
,
subdued
by
the
extraordinary
ascendancy
Monte
Cristo
*NL*
exercised
over
everything
around
him
,
did
not
endeavor
to
resist
it
.
He
*NL*
pressed
the
count
's
hand
and
left
.
He
stopped
one
moment
at
the
door
for
*NL*
Baptistin
,
whom
he
saw
in
the
Rue
Matignon
,
and
who
was
running
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
Villefort
and
d'Avrigny
had
made
all
possible
haste
,
*NL*
Valentine
had
not
revived
from
her
fainting
fit
on
their
arrival
,
and
*NL*
the
doctor
examined
the
invalid
with
all
the
care
the
circumstances
*NL*
demanded
,
and
with
an
interest
which
the
knowledge
of
the
secret
*NL*
intensified
twofold
.
Villefort
,
closely
watching
his
countenance
and
his
*NL*
lips
,
awaited
the
result
of
the
examination
.
Noirtier
,
paler
than
even
*NL*
the
young
girl
,
more
eager
than
Villefort
for
the
decision
,
was
watching
*NL*
also
intently
and
affectionately
.
At
last
d'Avrigny
slowly
uttered
these
*NL*
words
:
--
``
she
is
still
alive
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Still
?
''
cried
Villefort
;
``
oh
,
doctor
,
what
a
dreadful
word
is
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
the
physician
,
``
I
repeat
it
;
she
is
still
alive
,
and
I
am
*NL*
astonished
at
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
is
she
safe
?
''
asked
the
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
since
she
lives
.
''
At
that
moment
d'Avrigny
's
glance
met
Noirtier
's
*NL*
eye
.
It
glistened
with
such
extraordinary
joy
,
so
rich
and
full
of
*NL*
thought
,
that
the
physician
was
struck
.
He
placed
the
young
girl
again
*NL*
on
the
chair
,
--
her
lips
were
scarcely
discernible
,
they
were
so
pale
and
*NL*
white
,
as
well
as
her
whole
face
,
--
and
remained
motionless
,
looking
at
*NL*
Noirtier
,
who
appeared
to
anticipate
and
commend
all
he
did
.
``
Sir
,
''
*NL*
said
d'Avrigny
to
Villefort
,
``
call
Mademoiselle
Valentine
's
maid
,
if
you
*NL*
please
.
''
Villefort
went
himself
to
find
her
;
and
d'Avrigny
approached
*NL*
Noirtier
.
``
Have
you
something
to
tell
me
?
''
asked
he
.
The
old
man
*NL*
winked
his
eyes
expressively
,
which
we
may
remember
was
his
only
way
of
*NL*
expressing
his
approval
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Privately
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
will
remain
with
you
.
''
At
this
moment
Villefort
returned
,
*NL*
followed
by
the
lady
's
maid
;
and
after
her
came
Madame
de
Villefort
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
matter
,
then
,
with
this
dear
child
?
she
has
just
left
me
,
*NL*
and
she
complained
of
being
indisposed
,
but
I
did
not
think
seriously
of
*NL*
it
.
''
The
young
woman
with
tears
in
her
eyes
and
every
mark
of
affection
*NL*
of
a
true
mother
,
approached
Valentine
and
took
her
hand
.
D'Avrigny
*NL*
continued
to
look
at
Noirtier
;
he
saw
the
eyes
of
the
old
man
dilate
and
*NL*
become
round
,
his
cheeks
turn
pale
and
tremble
;
the
perspiration
stood
*NL*
in
drops
upon
his
forehead
.
``
Ah
,
''
said
he
,
involuntarily
following
*NL*
Noirtier
's
eyes
,
which
were
fixed
on
Madame
de
Villefort
,
who
*NL*
repeated
,
--
``
This
poor
child
would
be
better
in
bed
.
Come
,
Fanny
,
we
*NL*
will
put
her
to
bed
.
''
M.
d'Avrigny
,
who
saw
that
would
be
a
means
of
*NL*
his
remaining
alone
with
Noirtier
,
expressed
his
opinion
that
it
was
the
*NL*
best
thing
that
could
be
done
;
but
he
forbade
that
anything
should
be
*NL*
given
to
her
except
what
he
ordered
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
carried
Valentine
away
;
she
had
revived
,
but
could
scarcely
move
*NL*
or
speak
,
so
shaken
was
her
frame
by
the
attack
.
She
had
,
however
,
just
*NL*
power
to
give
one
parting
look
to
her
grandfather
,
who
in
losing
her
*NL*
seemed
to
be
resigning
his
very
soul
.
D'Avrigny
followed
the
invalid
,
*NL*
wrote
a
prescription
,
ordered
Villefort
to
take
a
cabriolet
,
go
in
*NL*
person
to
a
chemist
's
to
get
the
prescribed
medicine
,
bring
it
himself
,
*NL*
and
wait
for
him
in
his
daughter
's
room
.
Then
,
having
renewed
his
*NL*
injunction
not
to
give
Valentine
anything
,
he
went
down
again
to
*NL*
Noirtier
,
shut
the
doors
carefully
,
and
after
convincing
himself
that
*NL*
no
one
was
listening
,
--
``
Do
you
,
''
said
he
,
``
know
anything
of
this
young
*NL*
lady
's
illness
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
the
old
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
no
time
to
lose
;
I
will
question
,
and
do
you
answer
me
.
''
*NL*
Noirtier
made
a
sign
that
he
was
ready
to
answer
.
``
Did
you
anticipate
*NL*
the
accident
which
has
happened
to
your
granddaughter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
D'Avrigny
reflected
a
moment
;
then
approaching
Noirtier
,
--
``
Pardon
*NL*
what
I
am
going
to
say
,
''
added
he
,
``
but
no
indication
should
be
*NL*
neglected
in
this
terrible
situation
.
Did
you
see
poor
Barrois
die
?
''
*NL*
Noirtier
raised
his
eyes
to
heaven
.
``
Do
you
know
of
what
he
died
!
''
asked
*NL*
d'Avrigny
,
placing
his
hand
on
Noirtier
's
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
replied
the
old
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
he
died
a
natural
death
?
''
A
sort
of
smile
was
discernible
*NL*
on
the
motionless
lips
of
Noirtier
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
have
thought
that
Barrois
was
poisoned
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
the
poison
he
fell
a
victim
to
was
intended
for
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
the
same
hand
which
unintentionally
struck
Barrois
has
now
*NL*
attacked
Valentine
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
will
she
die
too
?
''
asked
d'Avrigny
,
fixing
his
penetrating
gaze
on
*NL*
Noirtier
.
He
watched
the
effect
of
this
question
on
the
old
man
.
``
No
,
''
*NL*
replied
he
with
an
air
of
triumph
which
would
have
puzzled
the
most
*NL*
clever
diviner
.
``
Then
you
hope
?
''
said
d'Avrigny
,
with
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
hope
?
''
The
old
man
made
him
understand
with
his
eyes
that
*NL*
he
could
not
answer
.
``
Ah
,
yes
,
it
is
true
,
''
murmured
d'Avrigny
.
Then
,
*NL*
turning
to
Noirtier
,
--
``
Do
you
hope
the
assassin
will
be
tried
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
hope
the
poison
will
take
no
effect
on
Valentine
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
no
news
to
you
,
''
added
d'Avrigny
,
``
to
tell
you
that
an
*NL*
attempt
has
been
made
to
poison
her
?
''
The
old
man
made
a
sign
that
he
*NL*
entertained
no
doubt
upon
the
subject
.
``
Then
how
do
you
hope
Valentine
*NL*
will
escape
?
''
Noirtier
kept
his
eyes
steadfastly
fixed
on
the
same
*NL*
spot
.
D'Avrigny
followed
the
direction
and
saw
that
they
were
fixed
on
a
*NL*
bottle
containing
the
mixture
which
he
took
every
morning
.
``
Ah
,
indeed
?
''
*NL*
said
d'Avrigny
,
struck
with
a
sudden
thought
,
``
has
it
occurred
to
*NL*
you
''
--
Noirtier
did
not
let
him
finish
.
``
Yes
,
''
said
he
.
``
To
prepare
her
*NL*
system
to
resist
poison
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
accustoming
her
by
degrees
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
yes
,
''
said
Noirtier
,
delighted
to
be
understood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
.
I
had
told
you
that
there
was
brucine
in
the
mixture
I
give
*NL*
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
by
accustoming
her
to
that
poison
,
you
have
endeavored
to
*NL*
neutralize
the
effect
of
a
similar
poison
?
''
Noirtier
's
joy
continued
.
*NL*
``
And
you
have
succeeded
,
''
exclaimed
d'Avrigny
.
``
Without
that
precaution
*NL*
Valentine
would
have
died
before
assistance
could
have
been
procured
.
*NL*
The
dose
has
been
excessive
,
but
she
has
only
been
shaken
by
it
;
and
*NL*
this
time
,
at
any
rate
,
Valentine
will
not
die
.
''
A
superhuman
joy
*NL*
expanded
the
old
man
's
eyes
,
which
were
raised
towards
heaven
with
an
*NL*
expression
of
infinite
gratitude
.
At
this
moment
Villefort
returned
.
*NL*
``
Here
,
doctor
,
''
said
he
,
``
is
what
you
sent
me
for
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
this
prepared
in
your
presence
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
replied
the
procureur
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
not
let
it
go
out
of
your
hands
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
D'Avrigny
took
the
bottle
,
poured
some
drops
of
the
mixture
it
*NL*
contained
in
the
hollow
of
his
hand
,
and
swallowed
them
.
``
Well
,
''
said
*NL*
he
,
``
let
us
go
to
Valentine
;
I
will
give
instructions
to
every
one
,
and
*NL*
you
,
M.
de
Villefort
,
will
yourself
see
that
no
one
deviates
from
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
moment
when
d'Avrigny
was
returning
to
Valentine
's
room
,
*NL*
accompanied
by
Villefort
,
an
Italian
priest
,
of
serious
demeanor
and
*NL*
calm
and
firm
tone
,
hired
for
his
use
the
house
adjoining
the
hotel
of
*NL*
M.
de
Villefort
.
No
one
knew
how
the
three
former
tenants
of
that
house
*NL*
left
it
.
About
two
hours
afterwards
its
foundation
was
reported
to
be
*NL*
unsafe
;
but
the
report
did
not
prevent
the
new
occupant
establishing
*NL*
himself
there
with
his
modest
furniture
the
same
day
at
five
o'clock
.
*NL*
The
lease
was
drawn
up
for
three
,
six
,
or
nine
years
by
the
new
tenant
,
*NL*
who
,
according
to
the
rule
of
the
proprietor
,
paid
six
months
in
*NL*
advance
.
This
new
tenant
,
who
,
as
we
have
said
,
was
an
Italian
,
was
*NL*
called
Il
Signor
Giacomo
Busoni
.
Workmen
were
immediately
called
in
,
*NL*
and
that
same
night
the
passengers
at
the
end
of
the
faubourg
saw
with
*NL*
surprise
that
carpenters
and
masons
were
occupied
in
repairing
the
lower
*NL*
part
of
the
tottering
house
.

Chapter
95
.
Father
and
Daughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
saw
in
a
preceding
chapter
how
Madame
Danglars
went
formally
to
*NL*
announce
to
Madame
de
Villefort
the
approaching
marriage
of
Eugenie
*NL*
Danglars
and
M.
Andrea
Cavalcanti
.
This
announcement
,
which
implied
or
*NL*
appeared
to
imply
,
the
approval
of
all
the
persons
concerned
in
this
*NL*
momentous
affair
,
had
been
preceded
by
a
scene
to
which
our
readers
must
*NL*
be
admitted
.
We
beg
them
to
take
one
step
backward
,
and
to
transport
*NL*
themselves
,
the
morning
of
that
day
of
great
catastrophes
,
into
the
*NL*
showy
,
gilded
salon
we
have
before
shown
them
,
and
which
was
the
pride
*NL*
of
its
owner
,
Baron
Danglars
.
In
this
room
,
at
about
ten
o'clock
in
the
*NL*
morning
,
the
banker
himself
had
been
walking
to
and
fro
for
some
*NL*
minutes
thoughtfully
and
in
evident
uneasiness
,
watching
both
doors
,
and
*NL*
listening
to
every
sound
.
When
his
patience
was
exhausted
,
he
called
his
*NL*
valet
.
``
Etienne
,
''
said
he
,
``
see
why
Mademoiselle
Eugenie
has
asked
me
to
*NL*
meet
her
in
the
drawing-room
,
and
why
she
makes
me
wait
so
long
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Having
given
this
vent
to
his
ill-humor
,
the
baron
became
more
calm
;
*NL*
Mademoiselle
Danglars
had
that
morning
requested
an
interview
with
*NL*
her
father
,
and
had
fixed
on
the
gilded
drawing-room
as
the
spot
.
The
*NL*
singularity
of
this
step
,
and
above
all
its
formality
,
had
not
a
*NL*
little
surprised
the
banker
,
who
had
immediately
obeyed
his
daughter
*NL*
by
repairing
first
to
the
drawing-room
.
Etienne
soon
returned
from
his
*NL*
errand
.
``
Mademoiselle
's
lady
's
maid
says
,
sir
,
that
mademoiselle
is
*NL*
finishing
her
toilette
,
and
will
be
here
shortly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Danglars
nodded
,
to
signify
that
he
was
satisfied
.
To
the
world
and
to
*NL*
his
servants
Danglars
assumed
the
character
of
the
good-natured
man
and
*NL*
the
indulgent
father
.
This
was
one
of
his
parts
in
the
popular
comedy
he
*NL*
was
performing
,
--
a
make-up
he
had
adopted
and
which
suited
him
about
as
*NL*
well
as
the
masks
worn
on
the
classic
stage
by
paternal
actors
,
who
seen
*NL*
from
one
side
,
were
the
image
of
geniality
,
and
from
the
other
showed
*NL*
lips
drawn
down
in
chronic
ill-temper
.
Let
us
hasten
to
say
that
in
*NL*
private
the
genial
side
descended
to
the
level
of
the
other
,
so
that
*NL*
generally
the
indulgent
man
disappeared
to
give
place
to
the
brutal
*NL*
husband
and
domineering
father
.
``
Why
the
devil
does
that
foolish
girl
,
*NL*
who
pretends
to
wish
to
speak
to
me
,
not
come
into
my
study
?
and
why
on
*NL*
earth
does
she
want
to
speak
to
me
at
all
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
turning
this
thought
over
in
his
brain
for
the
twentieth
time
,
*NL*
when
the
door
opened
and
Eugenie
appeared
,
attired
in
a
figured
black
*NL*
satin
dress
,
her
hair
dressed
and
gloves
on
,
as
if
she
were
going
to
the
*NL*
Italian
Opera
.
``
Well
,
Eugenie
,
what
is
it
you
want
with
me
?
and
why
in
*NL*
this
solemn
drawing-room
when
the
study
is
so
comfortable
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
quite
understand
why
you
ask
,
sir
,
''
said
Eugenie
,
making
a
sign
that
*NL*
her
father
might
be
seated
,
``
and
in
fact
your
two
questions
suggest
*NL*
fully
the
theme
of
our
conversation
.
I
will
answer
them
both
,
and
*NL*
contrary
to
the
usual
method
,
the
last
first
,
because
it
is
the
least
*NL*
difficult
.
I
have
chosen
the
drawing-room
,
sir
,
as
our
place
of
meeting
,
*NL*
in
order
to
avoid
the
disagreeable
impressions
and
influences
of
a
*NL*
banker
's
study
.
Those
gilded
cashbooks
,
drawers
locked
like
gates
of
*NL*
fortresses
,
heaps
of
bank-bills
,
come
from
I
know
not
where
,
and
the
*NL*
quantities
of
letters
from
England
,
Holland
,
Spain
,
India
,
China
,
and
*NL*
Peru
,
have
generally
a
strange
influence
on
a
father
's
mind
,
and
make
*NL*
him
forget
that
there
is
in
the
world
an
interest
greater
and
more
*NL*
sacred
than
the
good
opinion
of
his
correspondents
.
I
have
,
therefore
,
*NL*
chosen
this
drawing-room
,
where
you
see
,
smiling
and
happy
in
their
*NL*
magnificent
frames
,
your
portrait
,
mine
,
my
mother
's
,
and
all
sorts
*NL*
of
rural
landscapes
and
touching
pastorals
.
I
rely
much
on
external
*NL*
impressions
;
perhaps
,
with
regard
to
you
,
they
are
immaterial
,
but
I
*NL*
should
be
no
artist
if
I
had
not
some
fancies
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
''
replied
M.
Danglars
,
who
had
listened
to
all
this
preamble
*NL*
with
imperturbable
coolness
,
but
without
understanding
a
word
,
since
*NL*
like
every
man
burdened
with
thoughts
of
the
past
,
he
was
occupied
with
*NL*
seeking
the
thread
of
his
own
ideas
in
those
of
the
speaker
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
,
then
,
the
second
point
cleared
up
,
or
nearly
so
,
''
said
*NL*
Eugenie
,
without
the
least
confusion
,
and
with
that
masculine
*NL*
pointedness
which
distinguished
her
gesture
and
her
language
;
``
and
you
*NL*
appear
satisfied
with
the
explanation
.
Now
,
let
us
return
to
the
first
.
*NL*
You
ask
me
why
I
have
requested
this
interview
;
I
will
tell
you
in
two
*NL*
words
,
sir
;
I
will
not
marry
count
Andrea
Cavalcanti
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Danglars
leaped
from
his
chair
and
raised
his
eyes
and
arms
towards
*NL*
heaven
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
indeed
,
sir
,
''
continued
Eugenie
,
still
quite
calm
;
``
you
are
*NL*
astonished
,
I
see
;
for
since
this
little
affair
began
,
I
have
not
*NL*
manifested
the
slightest
opposition
,
and
yet
I
am
always
sure
,
when
the
*NL*
opportunity
arrives
,
to
oppose
a
determined
and
absolute
will
to
people
*NL*
who
have
not
consulted
me
,
and
things
which
displease
me
.
However
,
this
*NL*
time
,
my
tranquillity
,
or
passiveness
as
philosophers
say
,
proceeded
*NL*
from
another
source
;
it
proceeded
from
a
wish
,
like
a
submissive
and
*NL*
devoted
daughter
''
-LRB-
a
slight
smile
was
observable
on
the
purple
lips
of
*NL*
the
young
girl
-RRB-
,
``
to
practice
obedience
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
asked
Danglars
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
sir
,
''
replied
Eugenie
,
``
I
have
tried
to
the
very
last
and
now
*NL*
that
the
moment
has
come
,
I
feel
in
spite
of
all
my
efforts
that
it
is
*NL*
impossible
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
''
said
Danglars
,
whose
weak
mind
was
at
first
quite
overwhelmed
*NL*
with
the
weight
of
this
pitiless
logic
,
marking
evident
premeditation
*NL*
and
force
of
will
,
``
what
is
your
reason
for
this
refusal
,
Eugenie
?
what
*NL*
reason
do
you
assign
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
reason
?
''
replied
the
young
girl
.
``
Well
,
it
is
not
that
the
man
is
*NL*
more
ugly
,
more
foolish
,
or
more
disagreeable
than
any
other
;
no
,
*NL*
M.
Andrea
Cavalcanti
may
appear
to
those
who
look
at
men
's
faces
and
*NL*
figures
as
a
very
good
specimen
of
his
kind
.
It
is
not
,
either
,
that
*NL*
my
heart
is
less
touched
by
him
than
any
other
;
that
would
be
a
*NL*
schoolgirl
's
reason
,
which
I
consider
quite
beneath
me
.
I
actually
love
*NL*
no
one
,
sir
;
you
know
it
,
do
you
not
?
I
do
not
then
see
why
,
without
*NL*
real
necessity
,
I
should
encumber
my
life
with
a
perpetual
companion
.
*NL*
Has
not
some
sage
said
,
`
Nothing
too
much
'
?
and
another
,
'
I
carry
all
my
*NL*
effects
with
me
'
?
I
have
been
taught
these
two
aphorisms
in
Latin
and
in
*NL*
Greek
;
one
is
,
I
believe
,
from
Phaedrus
,
and
the
other
from
Bias
.
*NL*
Well
,
my
dear
father
,
in
the
shipwreck
of
life
--
for
life
is
an
eternal
*NL*
shipwreck
of
our
hopes
--
I
cast
into
the
sea
my
useless
encumbrance
,
that
*NL*
is
all
,
and
I
remain
with
my
own
will
,
disposed
to
live
perfectly
alone
,
*NL*
and
consequently
perfectly
free
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Unhappy
girl
,
unhappy
girl
!
''
murmured
Danglars
,
turning
pale
,
for
*NL*
he
knew
from
long
experience
the
solidity
of
the
obstacle
he
had
so
*NL*
suddenly
encountered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Unhappy
girl
,
''
replied
Eugenie
,
``
unhappy
girl
,
do
you
say
,
sir
?
No
,
*NL*
indeed
;
the
exclamation
appears
quite
theatrical
and
affected
.
Happy
,
on
*NL*
the
contrary
,
for
what
am
I
in
want
of
!
The
world
calls
me
beautiful
.
*NL*
It
is
something
to
be
well
received
.
I
like
a
favorable
reception
;
it
*NL*
expands
the
countenance
,
and
those
around
me
do
not
then
appear
so
ugly
.
*NL*
I
possess
a
share
of
wit
,
and
a
certain
relative
sensibility
,
which
*NL*
enables
me
to
draw
from
life
in
general
,
for
the
support
of
mine
,
all
I
*NL*
meet
with
that
is
good
,
like
the
monkey
who
cracks
the
nut
to
get
at
its
*NL*
contents

I
am
rich
,
for
you
have
one
of
the
first
fortunes
in
France
.
I
*NL*
am
your
only
daughter
,
and
you
are
not
so
exacting
as
the
fathers
of
the
*NL*
Porte
Saint-Martin
and
Gaiete
,
who
disinherit
their
daughters
for
not
*NL*
giving
them
grandchildren
.
Besides
,
the
provident
law
has
deprived
you
*NL*
of
the
power
to
disinherit
me
,
at
least
entirely
,
as
it
has
also
of
*NL*
the
power
to
compel
me
to
marry
Monsieur
This
or
Monsieur
That
.
And
*NL*
so
--
being
,
beautiful
,
witty
,
somewhat
talented
,
as
the
comic
operas
say
,
*NL*
and
rich
--
and
that
is
happiness
,
sir

why
do
you
call
me
unhappy

*NL*
*NL*
Danglars
,
seeing
his
daughter
smiling
,
and
proud
even
to
insolence
,
*NL*
could
not
entirely
repress
his
brutal
feelings
,
but
they
betrayed
*NL*
themselves
only
by
an
exclamation
.
Under
the
fixed
and
inquiring
gaze
*NL*
levelled
at
him
from
under
those
beautiful
black
eyebrows
,
he
prudently
*NL*
turned
away
,
and
calmed
himself
immediately
,
daunted
by
the
power
of
a
*NL*
resolute
mind
.
``
Truly
,
my
daughter
,
''
replied
he
with
a
smile
,
``
you
are
*NL*
all
you
boast
of
being
,
excepting
one
thing
;
I
will
not
too
hastily
tell
*NL*
you
which
,

would
rather
leave
you
to
guess
it

Eugenie
looked
at

much
surprised
that
one
flower
of
her
crown
of
pride
,
with
*NL*
which
she
had
so
superbly
decked
herself
,
should
be
disputed
.
``
My
*NL*
daughter

''
continued
the
banker
,
``
you
have
perfectly
explained
to
me
the
*NL*
sentiments
which
influence
a

like
you
,
who
is
determined
she
will
*NL*
not
marry

now
it
remains
for
me
to
tell
you
the
motives
of
a
father
*NL*
like
me
,
who
has
decided
that
his
daughter
shall
marry

''
Eugenie
*NL*
bowed
,
not
as
a
submissive
daughter
,
but
as
an
adversary
prepared
for
a
*NL*
discussion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
daughter
,
''
continued
Danglars
,
``
when
a
father
asks
his
daughter
to
*NL*
choose
a
husband
,
he
has
always
some
reason
for
wishing
her
to
marry
.
*NL*
Some
are
affected
with
the
mania
of
which
you
spoke
just
now
,
that
of
*NL*
living
again
in
their
grandchildren
.
This
is
not
my
weakness
,
I
tell
you
*NL*
at
once
;
family
joys
have
no
charm
for
me
.
I
may
acknowledge
this
to
*NL*
a
daughter
whom
I
know
to
be
philosophical
enough
to
understand
my
*NL*
indifference
,
and
not
to
impute
it
to
me
as
a
crime
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
not
to
the
purpose
,
''
said
Eugenie
;
``
let
us
speak
candidly
,
sir
;
*NL*
I
admire
candor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
said
Danglars
,
``
I
can
,
when
circumstances
render
it
desirable
,
*NL*
adopt
your
system
,
although
it
may
not
be
my
general
practice
.
I
will
*NL*
therefore
proceed
.
I
have
proposed
to
you
to
marry
,
not
for
your
sake
,
*NL*
for
indeed
I
did
not
think
of
you
in
the

at
the
moment
-LRB-
you
admire
*NL*
candor
,
and
will
now
be
satisfied
,
I
hope
-RRB-
;
but
because
it
suited
me
*NL*
to
marry
you
as
soon
as
possible
,
on
account
of
certain
commercial
*NL*
speculations
I
am
desirous
of
entering
into
.
''
Eugenie
became
uneasy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
just
as
I
tell
you
,
I
assure
you
,
and
you
must
not
be
angry
with
*NL*
me
,
for
you
have
sought
this
disclosure
.
I
do
not
willingly
enter
into
*NL*
arithmetical
explanations
with
an
artist
like
you
,
who
fears
to
enter
my
*NL*
study
lest
she
should
imbibe
disagreeable
or
anti-poetic
impressions
and
*NL*
sensations
.
But
in
that
same
banker
's
study
,
where
you
very
willingly
*NL*
presented
yourself
yesterday
to
ask
for
the
thousand
francs
I
give
you
*NL*
monthly
for
pocket-money
,
you
must
know
,
my
dear
young
lady
,
that
many
*NL*
things
may
be
learned
,
useful
even
to
a
girl
who
will
not
marry
.
*NL*
There
one
may
learn
,
for
instance
,
what
,
out
of
regard
to
your
nervous
*NL*
susceptibility
,
I
will
inform
you
of
in
the
drawing-room
,
namely
,
that
*NL*
the
credit
of
a
banker
is
his
physical
and
moral
life
;
that
credit
*NL*
sustains
him
as
breath
animates
the
body
;
and
M.
de
Monte
Cristo
once
*NL*
gave
me
a
lecture
on
that
subject
,
which
I
have
never
forgotten
.
There
*NL*
we
may
learn
that
as
credit
sinks
,
the
body
becomes
a
corpse
,
and
this
*NL*
is
what
must
happen
very
soon
to
the
banker
who
is
proud
to
own
so
good
*NL*
a
logician
as
you
for
his
daughter
.
''
But
Eugenie
,
instead
of
stooping
,
*NL*
drew
herself
up
under
the
blow
.
``
Ruined
?
''
said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Exactly
,
my
daughter
;
that
is
precisely
what
I
mean
,
''
said
Danglars
,
*NL*
almost
digging
his
nails
into
his
breast
,
while
he
preserved
on
*NL*
his
harsh
features
the
smile
of
the
heartless
though
clever
man
;
*NL*
``
ruined
--
yes
,
that
is
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
said
Eugenie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
ruined
!
Now
it
is
revealed
,
this
secret
so
full
of
horror
,
as
*NL*
the
tragic
poet
says
.
Now
,
my
daughter
,
learn
from
my
lips
how
you
may
*NL*
alleviate
this
misfortune
,
so
far
as
it
will
affect
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
cried
Eugenie
,
``
you
are
a
bad
physiognomist
,
if
you
imagine
*NL*
I
deplore
on
my
own
account
the
catastrophe
of
which
you
warn
me
.
I
*NL*
ruined
?
and
what
will
that
signify
to
me
?
Have
I
not
my
talent
left
?
Can
*NL*
I
not
,
like
Pasta
,
Malibran
,
Grisi
,
acquire
for
myself
what
you
would
*NL*
never
have
given
me
,
whatever
might
have
been
your
fortune
,
a
hundred
*NL*
or
a
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
livres
per
annum
,
for
which
I
shall
be
*NL*
indebted
to
no
one
but
myself
;
and
which
,
instead
of
being
given
as
*NL*
you
gave
me
those
poor
twelve
thousand
francs
,
with
sour
looks
and
*NL*
reproaches
for
my
prodigality
,
will
be
accompanied
with
acclamations
,
*NL*
with
bravos
,
and
with
flowers
?
And
if
I
do
not
possess
that
talent
,
*NL*
which
your
smiles
prove
to
me
you
doubt
,
should
I
not
still
have
that
*NL*
ardent
love
of
independence
,
which
will
be
a
substitute
for
wealth
,
and
*NL*
which
in
my
mind
supersedes
even
the
instinct
of
self-preservation
?
*NL*
No
,
I
grieve
not
on
my
own
account
,
I
shall
always
find
a
resource
;
my
*NL*
books
,
my
pencils
,
my
piano
,
all
the
things
which
cost
but
little
,
and
*NL*
which
I
shall
be
able
to
procure
,
will
remain
my
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
that
I
sorrow
for
Madame
Danglars
?
Undeceive
yourself
*NL*
again
;
either
I
am
greatly
mistaken
,
or
she
has
provided
against
the
*NL*
catastrophe
which
threatens
you
,
and
,
which
will
pass
over
without
*NL*
affecting
her
.
She
has
taken
care
for
herself
,
--
at
least
I
hope
so
,
--
for
*NL*
her
attention
has
not
been
diverted
from
her
projects
by
watching
over
*NL*
me
.
She
has
fostered
my
independence
by
professedly
indulging
my
love
*NL*
for
liberty
.
Oh
,
no
,
sir
;
from
my
childhood
I
have
seen
too
much
,
and
*NL*
understood
too
much
,
of
what
has
passed
around
me
,
for
misfortune
to
*NL*
have
an
undue
power
over
me
.
From
my
earliest
recollections
,
I
have
been
*NL*
beloved
by
no
one

so
much
the
worse
;
that
has
naturally
led
me
to
love

no

so
much
the
better

now
you
have
my
profession
of
faith

*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,

said
Danglars
,
pale
with
anger
,
which
was
not
at
all
due
to
*NL*
offended
paternal
love
,

``

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
Eugenie

looking
so
earnestly
at
her
father

that
it
was
an
effort
for
the

to
endure
her
unrelenting
gaze

*NL*
*NL*
``
M.

continued
Danglars

``

amounting

three

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
admirable

said
Eugenie
with
sovereign
contempt

smoothing
her

gloves
out
one
upon
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
think
I
shall
deprive
you
of
those
three
millions
,
''
said
Danglars
;
*NL*
``
but
do
not
fear
it
.
They
are
destined
to
produce
at
least
ten

I
and
a
*NL*
brother
banker
have
obtained
a
grant
of
a
railway
,
the
only
industrial
*NL*
enterprise
which
in
these
days
promises
to
make
good
the
fabulous
*NL*
prospects
that
Law
once
held
out
to
the
eternally
deluded
Parisians
,
in
*NL*
the
fantastic
Mississippi
scheme
.
As
I
look
at
it
,
a
millionth
part
of
a
*NL*
railway
is
worth
fully
as
much
as
an
acre
of
waste
land
on
the
banks
*NL*
of
the
Ohio
.
We
make
in
our
case
a
deposit
,
on
a
mortgage
,
which
is
an
*NL*
advance
,
as
you
see
,
since

ten

fifteen

twenty

or
a

worth
of

Well

within

a
week
I
am
to
deposit
four
millions
for
my

the
four
millions

will
produce
ten

twelve

appear

recollect
so
well

replied
Eugenie

``
I
saw
you
arranging
a
*NL*
deposit

is
not
that
the
term

of
five
millions

a

you
*NL*
even
pointed
it
out
to
me
in
two
drafts
on
the
treasury
,
and
you
*NL*
were
astonished
that
so
valuable
a
paper
did
not
dazzle
my
eyes
like

lightning

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
those
five
millions
and
a
half
are
not
mine

are
only
a
*NL*
proof
of
the
great
confidence
placed
in
me
;
my
title
of
popular
banker
*NL*
has
gained
me
the
confidence
of
charitable
institutions
,
and
the
five
*NL*
millions
and
a
half
belong
to
them
;
at
any
other
time
I
should
not
have
*NL*
hesitated
to
make
use
of
them
,
but
the
great
losses
I
have
recently
*NL*
sustained
are
well
known
,
and
,
as
I
told
you
,
my
credit
is
rather
*NL*
shaken
.
That
deposit
may
be
at
any
moment
withdrawn
,
and
if
I
had
*NL*
employed
it
for
another
purpose
,
I
should
bring
on
me
a
disgraceful
*NL*
bankruptcy

I
do
not
despise
bankruptcies

believe
me

they
must
*NL*
be
those
which
enrich

not
those
which
ruin

Now
,
if
you
marry
M.

I
get
the
three
millions
,
or
even
if
it
is
thought
I
am
*NL*
going
to
get
them
,
my
credit
will
be
restored
,
and
my
fortune
,
which
*NL*
for
the
last

or
two
has
been
swallowed
up
in
gulfs
which
have
*NL*
been
opened
in
my
path

an
inconceivable
fatality

will
revive

Do
you

understand
me

Perfectly

extraordinary
to

the

did
not

asked

Danglars

the

resounded

the
*NL*
coachman
,
who
had
been
seated
a
quarter
of
an
hour
on
his
box
,
--
the
*NL*
elegant
phaeton
with
which
we
are
familiar
rapidly
turned
the
angle
of
*NL*
the
entrance-gate
,
and
cast
out
on
the
doorsteps
M.
Andrea
Cavalcanti
,
*NL*
as
decked
up
and
gay
as
if
he
were
going
to
marry
a
princess
.
He
*NL*
inquired
after
the
count
with
his
usual
familiarity
,
and
ascending
*NL*
lightly
to
the
second
story
met
him
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
.
The
count
*NL*
stopped
on
seeing
the
young
man
.
As
for
Andrea
,
he
was
launched
,
and
*NL*
when
he
was
once
launched
nothing
stopped
him
.
``
Ah
,
good
morning
,
*NL*
my
dear
count
,
''
said
he
.
``
Ah
,
M.
Andrea
,
''
said
the
latter
,
with
his
*NL*
half-jesting
tone
;
``
how
do
you
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Charmingly
,
as
you
see

I
am
come
to
talk
to
you
about
a

me

you
going
out

just
returned

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
going
out

*NL*
*NL*
``
Then

get
up

carriage

Tom
shall
follow
with
my
phaeton
in
tow

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

''
said
the
count
,
with
an
imperceptible
smile
of
contempt
,
for
*NL*
he
had
no
wish
to
be
seen
in
the
young
man
's
society
,
--
``
no
;
I
prefer
*NL*
listening
to
you
here

my
dear
M.
Andrea
;
we
can
chat
better
in-doors
,
*NL*
and
there
is
no
coachman
to
overhear
our
conversation
.
''
The
count
*NL*
returned
to
a
small
drawing-room
on
the
first
floor
,
sat
down
,
and
*NL*
crossing
his
legs
motioned
to
the
young
man
to
take
a
seat
also
.
Andrea
*NL*
assumed
his
gayest
manner
.
``
You
know
,
my
dear
count

said
he
,
``
the
*NL*
ceremony

to
take

o'clock

*NL*

*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

yes

the

him
yesterday

do
not

*NL*

Possibly
my

trusted

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

Monte

``
you

fortunate

Danglars
is
*NL*
a
handsome
girl

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

Cavalcanti

in

modest

*NL*

Above
all

she

very

*NL*
*NL*
``
Very

the
young
man

*NL*
*NL*

Doubtless

conceals
at

half
of
his

*NL*
``
And
he
acknowledges
fifteen

said
Andrea
with
a
*NL*
look
sparkling
with
joy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Without

added
Monte

,
``
that
he
is
on
the
eve

entering

of
speculation
already
in
vogue
in

quite
novel
in
France

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

yes

not

*NL*
*NL*
``
Precisely

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ten
millions
!
Do
you
think
so

It
is
magnificent

said
Cavalcanti
,
*NL*
who
was
quite
confounded
at
the
metallic
sound
of
these
golden
words
.
*NL*
``
Without
reckoning

''
replied
Monte
Cristo
,
``
that
all
his
fortune
will
*NL*
come
to
you

justly
too

your

assured
me

almost
equal
to

enough
of

*NL*
Do
you

M.

skilfully

*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
badly

the
young

I
was
born

diplomatist

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

you
must
become
a
diplomatist
;
diplomacy

you
know

is
something

it

Have
you
lost
your

*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed

I
fear
it

replied
Andrea
,
in
the
tone
in
which
he
had
heard

Dorante

Valere
reply
to
Alceste

-RSB-
at

*NL*
``

Andrea
with

triumphant

I

Which

*NL*
*NL*

Monte

laying
a
marked
stress
*NL*
on
the
title

``
what
have
I
done
for
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

said
Andrea
,
--
``
no

it
is
useless
for

I
*NL*
maintain
that
the
position

you
has
done
more
than
my

*NL*
my
social
position
,
and
my
merit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
completely
mistaken
,
sir
,
''
said
Monte
Cristo
coldly
,
who
felt
*NL*
the
perfidious
manoeuvre
of
the
young
man
,
and
understood
the
bearing
*NL*
of
his
words
;
``
you
only
acquired
my
protection
after
the
influence
*NL*
and
fortune
of
your
father
had
been
ascertained
;
for
,
after
all
,
who
*NL*
procured
for
me

who
had
never
seen
either
you

your
illustrious

father

pleasure

your
acquaintance

two
of
my
good
friends

*NL*
Lord
Wilmore

the
Abbe
Busoni

encouraged
me
not
to
become
your
*NL*
surety

but
to
patronize
you
?

your
father
's
name
,
so
well
known
in
*NL*
Italy

so
highly
honored
.
Personally
,
I
do
not

''
This
calm
*NL*
tone
and
perfect
ease
made
Andrea
feel
that
he
was
,
for
the
moment
,
*NL*
restrained
by
a
more
muscular
hand
than
his
own
,
and
that
the
restraint
*NL*
could
not
be
easily
broken
through
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,

my
father
has
really
a
very
large
fortune

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
appears
so
,
sir

''
replied
Monte
Cristo
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
if
the
marriage
settlement
he
promised
me

come

*NL*
*NL*

been
advised

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
the
count
,
``
I
do
not

want

Andrea
was
so
surprised
that
he
pondered
the
matter
for
a
*NL*
moment
.
Then
,
arousing
from
his
revery
,
--
``
Now

and
disappeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
four
or
five
remaining
hours
before
nine
o'clock
arrived
,
Andrea
*NL*
employed
in
riding
,
paying
visits
,
--
designed
to
induce
those
of
whom
*NL*
he
had
spoken
to
appear
at
the
banker
's
in
their
gayest
*NL*
equipages
,
--
dazzling
them
by
promises
of
shares
in
schemes
which
have
*NL*
since
turned
every
brain
,
and
in
which
Danglars
was
just
taking
the
*NL*
initiative
.
In
fact
,
at
half-past
eight
in
the
evening
the
grand
salon
,
*NL*
the
gallery
adjoining
,
and
the
three
other
drawing-rooms
on
the
same
*NL*
floor
,
were
filled
with
a
perfumed
crowd
,
who
sympathized
but
little
*NL*
in
the
event
,
but
who
all
participated
in
that
love
of
being
present
*NL*
wherever
there
is
anything
fresh
to
be
seen
.
An
Academician
would
say
*NL*
that
the
entertainments
of
the
fashionable
world
are
collections
of
*NL*
flowers
which
attract
inconstant
butterflies
,
famished
bees
,
and
buzzing
*NL*
drones
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
one
could
deny
that
the
rooms
were
splendidly
illuminated
;
the
light
*NL*
streamed
forth
on
the
gilt
mouldings
and
the
silk
hangings
;
and
all
the
*NL*
bad
taste
of
decorations
,
which
had
only
their
richness
to
boast
of
,
*NL*
shone
in
its
splendor
.
Mademoiselle
Eugenie
was
dressed
with
elegant
*NL*
simplicity
in
a
figured
white
silk
dress
,
and
a
white
rose
half
*NL*
concealed
in
her
jet
black
hair
was
her
only
ornament
,
unaccompanied
*NL*
by
a
single
jewel
.
Her
eyes
,
however
,
betrayed
that
perfect
confidence
*NL*
which
contradicted
the
girlish
simplicity
of
this
modest
attire
.
Madame
*NL*
Danglars
was
chatting
at
a
short
distance
with
Debray
,
Beauchamp
,
and
*NL*
Chateau-Renaud
.
*NL*
*NL*
Debray
was
admitted
to
the
house
for
this
grand
ceremony
,
but
on
the
*NL*
same
plane
with
every
one
else
,
and
without
any
particular
privilege
.
M.
*NL*
Danglars
,
surrounded
by
deputies
and
men
connected
with
the
revenue
,
was
*NL*
explaining
a
new
theory
of
taxation
which
he
intended
to
adopt
when
*NL*
the
course
of
events
had
compelled
the
government
to
call
him
into
the
*NL*
ministry
.
Andrea
,
on
whose
arm
hung
one
of
the
most
consummate
dandies
*NL*
of
the
opera
,
was
explaining
to
him
rather
cleverly
,
since
he
was
*NL*
obliged
to
be
bold
to
appear
at
ease
,
his
future
projects
,
and
the
new
*NL*
luxuries
he
meant
to
introduce
to
Parisian
fashions
with
his
hundred
and
*NL*
seventy-five
thousand
livres
per
annum
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
crowd
moved
to
and
fro
in
the
rooms
like
an
ebb
and
flow
of
*NL*
turquoises
,
rubies
,
emeralds
,
opals
,
and
diamonds
.
As
usual
,
the
oldest
*NL*
women
were
the
most
decorated
,
and
the
ugliest
the
most
conspicuous
.
If
*NL*
there
was
a
beautiful
lily
,
or
a
sweet
rose
,
you
had
to
search
for
it
,
*NL*
concealed
in
some
corner
behind
a
mother
with
a
turban
,
or
an
aunt
with
*NL*
a
bird
of
paradise
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
each
moment
,
in
the
midst
of
the
crowd
,
the
buzzing
,
and
the
*NL*
laughter
,
the
door-keeper
's
voice
was
heard
announcing
some
name
well
*NL*
known
in
the
financial
department
,
respected
in
the
army
,
or
illustrious
*NL*
in
the
literary
world
,
and
which
was
acknowledged
by
a
slight
movement
*NL*
in
the
different
groups
.
But
for
one
whose
privilege
it
was
to
agitate
*NL*
that
ocean
of
human
waves
,
how
many
were
received
with
a
look
of
*NL*
indifference
or
a
sneer
of
disdain
!
At
the
moment
when
the
hand
of
the
*NL*
massive
time-piece
,
representing
Endymion
asleep
,
pointed
to
nine
on
its
*NL*
golden
face
,
and
the
hammer
,
the
faithful
type
of
mechanical
thought
,
*NL*
struck
nine
times
,
the
name
of
the
Count
of
Monte
Cristo
resounded
in
*NL*
its
turn
,
and
as
if
by
an
electric
shock
all
the
assembly
turned
towards
*NL*
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
count
was
dressed
in
black
and
with
his
habitual
simplicity
;
his
*NL*
white
waistcoat
displayed
his
expansive
noble
chest
and
his
black
*NL*
stock
was
singularly
noticeable
because
of
its
contrast
with
the
deadly
*NL*
paleness
of
his
face
.
His
only
jewellery
was
a
chain
,
so
fine
that
the
*NL*
slender
gold
thread
was
scarcely
perceptible
on
his
white
waistcoat
.
A
*NL*
circle
was
immediately
formed
around
the
door
.
The
count
perceived
at
*NL*
one
glance
Madame
Danglars
at
one
end
of
the
drawing-room
,
M.
Danglars
*NL*
at
the
other
,
and
Eugenie
in
front
of
him
.
He
first
advanced
towards
the
*NL*
baroness
,
who
was
chatting
with
Madame
de
Villefort
,
who
had
come
alone
,
*NL*
Valentine
being
still
an
invalid
;
and
without
turning
aside
,
so
clear
*NL*
was
the
road
left
for
him
,
he
passed
from
the
baroness
to
Eugenie
,
whom
*NL*
he
complimented
in
such
rapid
and
measured
terms
,
that
the
proud
artist
*NL*
was
quite
struck
.
Near
her
was
Mademoiselle
Louise
d'Armilly
,
who
*NL*
thanked
the
count
for
the
letters
of
introduction
he
had
so
kindly
given
*NL*
her
for
Italy
,
which
she
intended
immediately
to
make
use
of
.
On
leaving
*NL*
these
ladies
he
found
himself
with
Danglars
,
who
had
advanced
to
meet
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
accomplished
these
three
social
duties
,
Monte
Cristo
stopped
,
*NL*
looking
around
him
with
that
expression
peculiar
to
a
certain
class
,
*NL*
which
seems
to
say
,
``
I
have
done
my
duty
,
now
let
others
do
theirs
.
''
*NL*
Andrea
,
who
was
in
an
adjoining
room
,
had
shared
in
the
sensation
caused
*NL*
by
the
arrival
of
Monte
Cristo
,
and
now
came
forward
to
pay
his
respects
*NL*
to
the
count
.
He
found
him
completely
surrounded
;
all
were
eager
to
*NL*
speak
to
him
,
as
is
always
the
case
with
those
whose
words
are
few
*NL*
and
weighty
.
The
solicitors
arrived
at
this
moment
and
arranged
their
*NL*
scrawled
papers
on
the
velvet
cloth
embroidered
with
gold
which
covered
*NL*
the
table
prepared
for
the
signature
;
it
was
a
gilt
table
supported
on
*NL*
lions
'
claws
.
One
of
the
notaries
sat
down
,
the
other
remained
standing
.
*NL*
They
were
about
to
proceed
to
the
reading
of
the
contract
,
which
half
*NL*
Paris
assembled
was
to
sign
.
All
took
their
places
,
or
rather
the
ladies
*NL*
formed
a
circle
,
while
the
gentlemen
-LRB-
more
indifferent
to
the
restraints
*NL*
of
what
Boileau
calls
the
``
energetic
style
''
-RRB-
commented
on
the
feverish
*NL*
agitation
of
Andrea
,
on
M.
Danglars
'
riveted
attention
,
Eugenie
's
*NL*
composure
,
and
the
light
and
sprightly
manner
in
which
the
baroness
*NL*
treated
this
important
affair
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
contract
was
read
during
a
profound
silence
.
But
as
soon
as
it
was
*NL*
finished
,
the
buzz
was
redoubled
through
all
the
drawing-rooms
;
the
*NL*
brilliant
sums
,
the
rolling
millions
which
were
to
be
at
the
command
*NL*
of
the
two
young
people
,
and
which
crowned
the
display
of
the
wedding
*NL*
presents
and
the
young
lady
's
diamonds
,
which
had
been
made
in
a
room
*NL*
entirely
appropriated
for
that
purpose
,
had
exercised
to
the
full
their
*NL*
delusions
over
the
envious
assembly
.
Mademoiselle
Danglars
'
charms
were
*NL*
heightened
in
the
opinion
of
the
young
men
,
and
for
the
moment
seemed
*NL*
to
outvie
the
sun
in
splendor
.
As
for
the
ladies
,
it
is
needless
to
say
*NL*
that
while
they
coveted
the
millions
,
they
thought
they
did
not
need
*NL*
them
for
themselves
,
as
they
were
beautiful
enough
without
them
.
Andrea
,
*NL*
surrounded
by
his
friends
,
complimented
,
flattered
,
beginning
to
believe
*NL*
in
the
reality
of
his
dream
,
was
almost
bewildered
.
The
notary
solemnly
*NL*
took
the
pen
,
flourished
it
above
his
head
,
and
said
,
``
Gentlemen
,
we
are
*NL*
about
to
sign
the
contract
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
baron
was
to
sign
first
,
then
the
representative
of
M.
Cavalcanti
,
*NL*
senior
,
then
the
baroness
,
afterwards
the
``
future
couple
,
''
as
they
are
*NL*
styled
in
the
abominable
phraseology
of
legal
documents
.
The
baron
took
*NL*
the
pen
and
signed
,
then
the
representative
.
The
baroness
approached
,
*NL*
leaning
on
Madame
de
Villefort
's
arm
.
``
My
dear
,
''
said
she
,
as
she
took
*NL*
the
pen
,
``
is
it
not
vexatious
?
An
unexpected
incident
,
in
the
affair
of
*NL*
murder
and
theft
at
the
Count
of
Monte
Cristo
's
,
in
which
he
nearly
fell
*NL*
a
victim
,
deprives
us
of
the
pleasure
of
seeing
M.
de
Villefort
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
?
''
said
M.
Danglars
,
in
the
same
tone
in
which
he
would
have
*NL*
said
,
``
Oh
,
well
,
what
do
I
care
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
a
matter
of
fact
,
''
said
Monte
Cristo
,
approaching
,
``
I
am
much
afraid
*NL*
that
I
am
the
involuntary
cause
of
his
absence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
you
,
count
?
''
said
Madame
Danglars
,
signing
;
``
if
you
are
,
take
*NL*
care
,
for
I
shall
never
forgive
you
.
''
Andrea
pricked
up
his
ears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
is
not
my
fault
,
as
I
shall
endeavor
to
prove
.
''
Every
one
*NL*
listened
eagerly
;
Monte
Cristo
who
so
rarely
opened
his
lips
,
was
about
*NL*
to
speak
.
``
You
remember
,
''
said
the
count
,
during
the
most
profound
*NL*
silence
,
``
that
the
unhappy
wretch
who
came
to
rob
me
died
at
my
house
;
*NL*
the
supposition
is
that
he
was
stabbed
by
his
accomplice
,
on
attempting
*NL*
to
leave
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Danglars
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
order
that
his
wounds
might
be
examined
he
was
undressed
,
and
his
*NL*
clothes
were
thrown
into
a
corner
,
where
the
police
picked
them
up
,
with
*NL*
the
exception
of
the
waistcoat
,
which
they
overlooked
.
''
Andrea
turned
*NL*
pale
,
and
drew
towards
the
door
;
he
saw
a
cloud
rising
in
the
horizon
,
*NL*
which
appeared
to
forebode
a
coming
storm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
this
waistcoat
was
discovered
to-day
,
covered
with
blood
,
and
*NL*
with
a
hole
over
the
heart
.
''
The
ladies
screamed
,
and
two
or
three
*NL*
prepared
to
faint
.
``
It
was
brought
to
me
.
No
one
could
guess
what
the
*NL*
dirty
rag
could
be
;
I
alone
suspected
that
it
was
the
waistcoat
of
the
*NL*
murdered
man
.
My
valet
,
in
examining
this
mournful
relic
,
felt
a
paper
*NL*
in
the
pocket
and
drew
it
out
;
it
was
a
letter
addressed
to
you
,
baron
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
me
?
''
cried
Danglars
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
indeed
,
to
you
;
I
succeeded
in
deciphering
your
name
under
the
*NL*
blood
with
which
the
letter
was
stained
,
''
replied
Monte
Cristo
,
amid
the
*NL*
general
outburst
of
amazement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
''
asked
Madame
Danglars
,
looking
at
her
husband
with
uneasiness
,
*NL*
``
how
could
that
prevent
M.
de
Villefort
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
this
simple
way
,
madame
,
''
replied
Monte
Cristo
;
``
the
waistcoat
and
*NL*
the
letter
were
both
what
is
termed
circumstantial
evidence
;
I
therefore
*NL*
sent
them
to
the
king
's
attorney
.
You
understand
,
my
dear
baron
,
that
*NL*
legal
methods
are
the
safest
in
criminal
cases
;
it
was
,
perhaps
,
*NL*
some
plot
against
you
.
''
Andrea
looked
steadily
at
Monte
Cristo
and
*NL*
disappeared
in
the
second
drawing-room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Possibly
,
''
said
Danglars
;
``
was
not
this
murdered
man
an
old
*NL*
galley-slave
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
replied
the
count
;
``
a
felon
named
Caderousse
.
''
Danglars
*NL*
turned
slightly
pale
;
Andrea
reached
the
anteroom
beyond
the
little
*NL*
drawing-room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
go
on
signing
,
''
said
Monte
Cristo
;
``
I
perceive
that
my
story
has
*NL*
caused
a
general
emotion
,
and
I
beg
to
apologize
to
you
,
baroness
,
and
*NL*
to
Mademoiselle
Danglars
.
''
The
baroness
,
who
had
signed
,
returned
*NL*
the
pen
to
the
notary
.
``
Prince
Cavalcanti
,
''
said
the
latter
;
``
Prince
*NL*
Cavalcanti
,
where
are
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Andrea
,
Andrea
,
''
repeated
several
young
people
,
who
were
already
on
*NL*
sufficiently
intimate
terms
with
him
to
call
him
by
his
Christian
name
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Call
the
prince
;
inform
him
that
it
is
his
turn
to
sign
,
''
cried
*NL*
Danglars
to
one
of
the
floorkeepers
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
at
the
same
instant
the
crowd
of
guests
rushed
in
alarm
into
the
*NL*
principal
salon
as
if
some
frightful
monster
had
entered
the
apartments
,
*NL*
quaerens
quem
devoret
.
There
was
,
indeed
,
reason
to
retreat
,
to
be
*NL*
alarmed
,
and
to
scream
.
An
officer
was
placing
two
soldiers
at
the
door
*NL*
of
each
drawing-room
,
and
was
advancing
towards
Danglars
,
preceded
by
a
*NL*
commissary
of
police
,
girded
with
his
scarf
.
Madame
Danglars
uttered
a
*NL*
scream
and
fainted
.
Danglars
,
who
thought
himself
threatened
-LRB-
certain
*NL*
consciences
are
never
calm
-RRB-
,
--
Danglars
even
before
his
guests
showed
a
*NL*
countenance
of
abject
terror
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
matter
,
sir
?
''
asked
Monte
Cristo
,
advancing
to
meet
the
*NL*
commissioner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Which
of
you
gentlemen
,
''
asked
the
magistrate
,
without
replying
to
the
*NL*
count
,
``
answers
to
the
name
of
Andrea
Cavalcanti
?
''
A
cry
of
astonishment
*NL*
was
heard
from
all
parts
of
the
room
.
They
searched
;
they
questioned
.
*NL*
``
But
who
then
is
Andrea
Cavalcanti
?
''
asked
Danglars
in
amazement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
galley-slave
,
escaped
from
confinement
at
Toulon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
crime
has
he
committed
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
accused

''
said
the
commissary
with
his
inflexible
voice
,
``
of
*NL*
having
assassinated
the
man
named
Caderousse

his
former
companion

moment
he
was
making
his
escape
from

house
of
the

cast

Chapter

The
Departure
for
Belgium
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
minutes
after
the
scene
of
confusion
produced
in
the
salons
of
M.
*NL*
Danglars
by
the
unexpected
appearance
of
the
brigade
of
soldiers
,
and
by
*NL*
the
disclosure
which
had
followed
,
the
mansion
was
deserted
with
as
*NL*
much
rapidity
as
if
a
case
of
plague
or
of
cholera
morbus
had
broken
out
*NL*
among
the
guests
.
In
a
few
minutes
,
through
all
the
doors
,
down
all
the
*NL*
staircases
,
by
every
exit
,
every
one
hastened
to
retire
,
or
rather
to
*NL*
fly
;
for
it
was
a
situation
where
the
ordinary
condolences
,
--
which
even
*NL*
the
best
friends
are
so
eager
to
offer
in
great
catastrophes
,
--
were
*NL*
seen
to
be
utterly
futile
.
There
remained
in
the
banker
's
house
only
*NL*
Danglars
,
closeted
in
his
study
,
and
making
his
statement
to
the
officer
*NL*
of
gendarmes
;
Madame
Danglars
,
terrified
,
in
the
boudoir
with
which
we
*NL*
are
acquainted
;
and
Eugenie
,
who
with
haughty
air
and
disdainful
lip
had
*NL*
retired
to
her
room
with
her
inseparable
companion
,
Mademoiselle
Louise
*NL*
d'Armilly
.
As
for
the
numerous
servants
-LRB-
more
numerous
that
evening
than
*NL*
usual
,
for
their
number
was
augmented
by
cooks
and
butlers
from
the
Cafe
*NL*
de
Paris
-RRB-
,
venting
on
their
employers
their
anger
at
what
they
termed
*NL*
the
insult
to
which
they
had
been
subjected
,
they
collected
in
groups
*NL*
in
the
hall
,
in
the
kitchens
,
or
in
their
rooms
,
thinking
very
little
of
*NL*
their
duty
,
which
was
thus
naturally
interrupted
.
Of
all
this
household
,
*NL*
only
two
persons
deserve
our
notice
;
these
are
Mademoiselle
Eugenie
*NL*
Danglars
and
Mademoiselle
Louise
d'Armilly
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
betrothed
had
retired
,
as
we
said
,
with
haughty
air
,
disdainful
lip
,
*NL*
and
the
demeanor
of
an
outraged
queen
,
followed
by
her
companion
,
who
*NL*
was
paler
and
more
disturbed
than
herself
.
On
reaching
her
room
Eugenie
*NL*
locked
her
door
,
while
Louise
fell
on
a
chair
.
``
Ah
,
what
a
dreadful
*NL*
thing
,
''
said
the
young
musician
;
``
who
would
have
suspected
it
?
M.
Andrea
*NL*
Cavalcanti
a
murderer
--
a
galley-slave
escaped
--
a
convict
!
''
An
ironical
*NL*
smile
curled
the
lip
of
Eugenie
.
``
In
truth
I
was
fated
,
''
said
she
.
``
I
*NL*
escaped
the
Morcerf
only
to
fall
into
the
Cavalcanti
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
do
not
confound
the
two
,
Eugenie
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hold
your
tongue
!
The
men
are
all
infamous
,
and
I
am
happy
to
be
able
*NL*
now
to
do
more
than
detest
them
--
I
despise
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
shall
we
do
?
''
asked
Louise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
shall
we
do

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
the
same
we
had
intended
doing
three
days
since

set
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
--
although
you
are
not
now
going
to
be
married
,
you
intend
*NL*
still

--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
,
Louise
.
I
hate
this
life
of
the
fashionable
world
,
always
*NL*
ordered
,
measured
,
ruled
,
like
our
music-paper
.
What
I
have
always
*NL*
wished
for
,
desired
,
and
coveted
,
is
the
life
of
an
artist
,
free
and
*NL*
independent
,
relying
only
on
my
own
resources
,
and
accountable
only
to
*NL*
myself
.
Remain
here
?
What
for
?
--
that
they
may
try
,
a
month
hence
,
*NL*
to
marry
me
again
;
and
to
whom
?
--
M.
Debray
,
perhaps
,
as
it
was
once
*NL*
proposed
.
No
,
Louise
,
no
!
This
evening
's
adventure
will
serve
for
my
*NL*
excuse
.
I
did
not
seek
one
,
I
did
not
ask
for
one

God
sends
me
this

*NL*
and
I
hail
it
joyfully

*NL*
*NL*
``
How
strong
and
courageous
you
are
!
''
said
the
fair
,
frail
girl
to
her
*NL*
brunette
companion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
not
yet
know
me

Come
,
Louise
,
let
us
talk
of
our
affairs

The

*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
happily
bought
three
days

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*

Our

*NL*
*NL*
``
Here

*NL*
*NL*
And
Eugenie
,
with
her
usual
precision
,
opened
a
printed
paper
,
and
*NL*
read
,

*NL*
*NL*
``
M.
Leon

*NL*
*NL*
``

you
get
this

*NL*
*NL*
``
When
I
went
to
ask
M.
de
Monte
Cristo
for
letters
to
the
directors
of
*NL*
the
theatres
at
Rome
and
Naples
,
I
expressed
my
fears
of
travelling
as
*NL*
a
woman
;
he
perfectly
understood
them
,
and
undertook
to
procure
for
me
*NL*
a
man
's
passport
,
and
two
days
after
I
received
this
,
to
which
I
have
*NL*
added
with
my
own
hand
,
`
travelling
with
his
sister

'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Eugenie
cheerfully
,
``
we
have
then
only
to
pack
up
our
*NL*
trunks
;
we
shall
start
the
evening
of
the
signing

the
contract
,
*NL*
instead
of
the
evening
of
the
wedding
--
that
is
all
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
consider
the
matter
seriously
,
Eugenie
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
am
done
with
considering
!
I
am
tired
of
hearing
only
of

reports

of
the
end
of
the
month
,
of
the
rise
and
fall
of
Spanish
funds

*NL*
of

Instead

Louise

you

air

*NL*
liberty
,
melody
of
birds
,
plains
of
Lombardy

Venetian
canals

the
Bay
of
Naples
.
How
much
have
we
,
Louise
?
''
The
young
girl
to
*NL*
whom
this
question
was
addressed
drew
from
an
inlaid
secretary
a
small
*NL*
portfolio
with
a
lock
,
in
which
she
counted
twenty-three
bank-notes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Twenty-three
thousand
francs
,
''
said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
as
much
,
at
least
,
in
pearls
,
diamonds
,
and
jewels
,
''
said
*NL*
Eugenie
.
``
We
are
rich
.
With
forty-five
thousand
francs
we
can
live
*NL*
like
princesses
for
two
years
,
and
comfortably
for
four
;
but
before
six
*NL*
months
--
you
with
your
music
,
and
I
with
my
voice
--
we
shall
double
our
*NL*
capital
.
Come
,
you
shall
take
charge
of
the
money
,
I
of
the
jewel-box
;
*NL*
so
that
if
one
of
us
had
the
misfortune
to
lose
her
treasure
,
the
other
*NL*
would
still
have
hers
left
.
Now
,
the
portmanteau
--
let
us
make
haste
--
the
*NL*
portmanteau
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stop
!
''
said
Louise
,
going
to
listen
at
Madame
Danglars
'
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
fear
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
we
may
be
discovered

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
door
is
locked
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
may
tell
us
to
open
it

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
may
if
they
like

but
we
will
not

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
a
perfect
Amazon
,
Eugenie
!
''
And
the
two
young
girls
began
*NL*
to
heap
into
a
trunk
all
the
things
they
thought
they
should
require
.
*NL*
``
There
now
,
''
said
Eugenie
,
``
while
I
change
my
costume
do
you
lock
the
*NL*
portmanteau
.
''
Louise
pressed
with
all
the
strength
of
her
little
hands
*NL*
on
the
top
of
the
portmanteau
.
``
But
I
can
not
,
''
said
she
;
``
I
am
not
*NL*
strong
enough
;
do
you
shut
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
you
do
well
to
ask
,
''
said
Eugenie
,
laughing
;
``
I
forgot
that
I
was
*NL*
Hercules
,
and
you
only
the
pale
Omphale
!
''
And
the
young
girl
,
kneeling
*NL*
on
the
top
,
pressed
the
two
parts
of
the
portmanteau
together
,
and
*NL*
Mademoiselle
d'Armilly
passed
the
bolt
of
the
padlock
through
.
When
this
*NL*
was
done
,
Eugenie
opened
a
drawer
,
of
which
she
kept
the
key
,
and
took
*NL*
from
it
a
wadded
violet
silk
travelling
cloak
.
``
Here
,
''
said
she
,
``
you
*NL*
see
I
have
thought
of
everything
;
with
this
cloak
you
will
not
be
cold
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
am
never
cold
,
you
know
!
Besides
,
with
these
men
's
clothes
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
dress
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
you
have
time
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
not
be
uneasy
,
you
little
coward
!
All
our
servants
are
busy
,
*NL*
discussing
the
grand
affair
.
Besides
,
what
is
there
astonishing
,
when
*NL*
you
think
of
the
grief
I
ought
to
be
in
,
that
I
shut
myself
up
?
--
tell
*NL*
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
truly
--
you
comfort
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
and
help
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
same
drawer
she
took
a
man
's
complete
costume
,
from
the
*NL*
boots
to
the
coat
,
and
a
provision
of
linen
,
where
there
was
nothing
*NL*
superfluous
,
but
every
requisite
.
Then
,
with
a
promptitude
which
*NL*
indicated
that
this
was
not
the
first
time
she
had
amused
herself
by
*NL*
adopting
the
garb
of
the
opposite
sex
,
Eugenie
drew
on
the
boots
and
*NL*
pantaloons
,
tied
her
cravat
,
buttoned
her
waistcoat
up
to
the
throat
,
*NL*
and
put
on
a
coat
which
admirably
fitted
her
beautiful
figure
.
``
Oh
,
that
*NL*
is
very
good
--
indeed
,
it
is
very
good
!
''
said
Louise
,
looking
at
her
with
*NL*
admiration
;
``
but
that
beautiful
black
hair
,
those
magnificent
braids
,
*NL*
which
made
all
the
ladies
sigh
with
envy
,
--
will
they
go
under
a
man
's
*NL*
hat
like
the
one
I
see
down
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
shall
see
,
''
said
Eugenie
.
And
with
her
left
hand
seizing
the
thick
*NL*
mass
,
which
her
long
fingers
could
scarcely
grasp
,
she
took
in
her
right
*NL*
hand
a
pair
of
long
scissors
,
and
soon
the
steel
met
through
the
rich
*NL*
and
splendid
hair
,
which
fell
in
a
cluster
at
her
feet
as
she
leaned
*NL*
back
to
keep
it
from
her
coat
.
Then
she
grasped
the
front
hair
,
which
*NL*
she
also
cut
off
,
without
expressing
the
least
regret
;
on
the
contrary
,
*NL*
her
eyes
sparkled
with
greater
pleasure
than
usual
under
her
ebony
*NL*
eyebrows
.
``
Oh
,
the
magnificent
hair
!
''
said
Louise
,
with
regret
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
am
I
not
a
hundred
times
better
thus
?
''
cried
Eugenie
,
smoothing
the
*NL*
scattered
curls
of
her
hair
,
which
had
now
quite
a
masculine
appearance
;
*NL*
``
and
do
you
not
think
me
handsomer
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
are
beautiful
--
always
beautiful
!
''
cried
Louise
.
``
Now
,
where
are
*NL*
you
going
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
Brussels
,
if
you
like
;
it
is
the
nearest
frontier
.
We
can
go
to
*NL*
Brussels
,
Liege
,
Aix-la-Chapelle
;
then
up
the
Rhine
to
Strasburg
.
We
*NL*
will
cross
Switzerland
,
and
go
down
into
Italy
by
the
Saint-Gothard
.
*NL*
Will
that
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
looking
at
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
looking
at
you

indeed
you
are
adorable
like
that

One
would
say
*NL*
you
were
carrying
me
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
they
would
be
right
,
pardieu
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
think
you
swore

Eugenie

''
And
the
two
young
girls
,
whom
every
*NL*
one
might
have
thought
plunged
in
grief
,
the
one
on
her
own
account
,
the
*NL*
other
from
interest
in
her
friend
,
burst
out
laughing
,
as
they
cleared
*NL*
away
every
visible
trace
of
the
disorder
which
had
naturally
accompanied
*NL*
the
preparations
for
their
escape
.
Then
,
having
blown
out
the
lights
,
*NL*
the
two
fugitives
,
looking
and
listening
eagerly
,
with
outstretched
*NL*
necks
,
opened
the
door
of
a
dressing-room
which
led
by
a
side
staircase
*NL*
down
to
the
yard
,
--
Eugenie
going
first
,
and
holding
with
one
arm
*NL*
the
portmanteau
,
which
by
the
opposite
handle
Mademoiselle
d'Armilly
*NL*
scarcely
raised
with
both
hands
.
The
yard
was
empty
;
the
clock
was
*NL*
striking
twelve
.
The
porter
was
not
yet
gone
to
bed
.
Eugenie
approached
*NL*
softly
,
and
saw
the
old
man
sleeping
soundly
in
an
arm-chair
in
his
*NL*
lodge
.
She
returned
to
Louise
,
took
up
the
portmanteau
,
which
she
had
*NL*
placed
for
a
moment
on
the
ground
,
and
they
reached
the
archway
under
*NL*
the
shadow
of
the
wall
.
*NL*
*NL*
Eugenie
concealed
Louise
in
an
angle
of
the
gateway
,
so
that
if
the
*NL*
porter
chanced
to
awake
he
might
see
but
one
person
.
Then
placing
*NL*
herself
in
the
full
light
of
the
lamp
which
lit
the
yard
,
--
``
Gate
!
''
cried
*NL*
she
,
with
her
finest
contralto
voice
,
and
rapping
at
the
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
porter
got
up
as
Eugenie
expected
,
and
even
advanced
some
steps
to
*NL*
recognize
the
person
who
was
going
out
,
but
seeing
a
young
man
striking
*NL*
his
boot
impatiently
with
his
riding-whip
,
he
opened
it
immediately
.
*NL*
Louise
slid
through
the
half-open
gate
like
a
snake
,
and
bounded
lightly
*NL*
forward
.
Eugenie
,
apparently
calm
,
although
in
all
probability
her
heart
*NL*
beat
somewhat
faster
than
usual
,
went
out
in
her
turn
.
A
porter
was
*NL*
passing
and
they
gave
him
the
portmanteau
;
then
the
two
young
girls
,
*NL*
having
told
him
to
take
it
to
No.
36
,
Rue
de
la
Victoire
,
walked
behind
*NL*
this
man
,
whose
presence
comforted
Louise
.
As
for
Eugenie
,
she
was
as
*NL*
strong
as
a
Judith
or
a
Delilah
.
They
arrived
at
the
appointed
spot
.
*NL*
Eugenie
ordered
the
porter
to
put
down
the
portmanteau
,
gave
him
some
*NL*
pieces
of
money
,
and
having
rapped
at
the
shutter
sent
him
away
.
The
*NL*
shutter
where
Eugenie
had
rapped
was
that
of
a
little
laundress
,
who
*NL*
had
been
previously
warned
,
and
was
not
yet
gone
to
bed
.
She
opened
the
*NL*
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mademoiselle
,
''
said
Eugenie
,
``
let
the
porter
get
the
post-chaise
from
*NL*
the
coach-house
,
and
fetch
some
post-horses
from
the
hotel
.
Here
are
*NL*
five
francs
for
his
trouble
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
''
said
Louise
,
``
I
admire
you
,
and
I
could
almost
say
respect
*NL*
you
.
''
The
laundress
looked
on
in
astonishment
,
but
as
she
had
been
*NL*
promised
twenty
louis
,
she
made
no
remark
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
quarter
of
an
hour
the
porter
returned
with
a
post-boy
and
horses
,
*NL*
which
were
harnessed
,
and
put
in
the
post-chaise
in
a
minute
,
while
the
*NL*
porter
fastened
the
portmanteau
on
with
the
assistance
of
a
cord
and
*NL*
strap
.
``
Here
is
the
passport
,
''
said
the
postilion
,
``
which
way
are
we
*NL*
going
,
young
gentleman
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
Fontainebleau
,
''
replied
Eugenie
with
an
almost
masculine
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
say
?
''
said
Louise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
giving
them
the
slip
,
''
said
Eugenie
;
``
this
woman
to
whom
we
have
*NL*
given
twenty
louis
may
betray
us
for
forty
;
we
will
soon
alter
our
*NL*
direction
.
''
And
the
young
girl
jumped
into
the
britzska
,
which
was
*NL*
admirably
arranged
for
sleeping
in
,
without
scarcely
touching
the
step
.
*NL*
``
You
are
always
right
,
''
said
the
music
teacher
,
seating
herself
by
the
*NL*
side
of
her
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
quarter
of
an
hour
afterwards
the
postilion
,
having
been
put
in
the
*NL*
right
road
,
passed
with
a
crack
of
his
whip
through
the
gateway
of
the
*NL*
Barriere
Saint-Martin
.
``
Ah
,
''
said
Louise
,
breathing
freely
,
``
here
we
are
*NL*
out
of
Paris
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
my
dear
,
the
abduction
is
an
accomplished
fact
,
''
replied
Eugenie
.
*NL*
``
Yes
,
and
without
violence
,
''
said
Louise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
bring
that
forward
as
an
extenuating
circumstance
,
''
replied
*NL*
Eugenie
.
These
words
were
lost
in
the
noise
which
the
carriage
made
in
*NL*
rolling
over
the
pavement
of
La
Villette
.
M.
Danglars
no
longer
had
a

daughter

The
Bell
and
Bottle

.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
let
us
leave
Mademoiselle
Danglars
and
her
friend
pursuing
their
*NL*
way
to
Brussels
,
and
return
to
poor
Andrea
Cavalcanti
,
so
inopportunely
*NL*
interrupted
in
his
rise
to
fortune
.
Notwithstanding
his
youth
,
Master
*NL*
Andrea
was
a
very
skilful
and
intelligent
boy
.
We
have
seen
that
on
*NL*
the
first
rumor
which
reached
the
salon
he
had
gradually
approached
the
*NL*
door
,
and
crossing
two
or
three
rooms
at
last
disappeared
.
But
we
have
*NL*
forgotten
to
mention
one
circumstance
,
which
nevertheless
ought
not
*NL*
to
be
omitted
;
in
one
of
the
rooms
he
crossed
,
the
trousseau
of
the
*NL*
bride-elect
was
on
exhibition
.
There
were
caskets
of
diamonds
,
cashmere
*NL*
shawls
,
Valenciennes
lace
,
English
veilings
,
and
in
fact
all
the
*NL*
tempting
things
,
the
bare
mention
of
which
makes
the
hearts
of
young
*NL*
girls
bound
with
joy
,
and
which
is
called
the
``
corbeille
.
''
-LSB-

-RSB-
Now
,
in
*NL*
passing
through
this
room
,
Andrea
proved
himself
not
only
to
be
clever
*NL*
and
intelligent
,
but
also
provident
,
for
he
helped
himself
to
the
most
*NL*
valuable
of
the
ornaments
before
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
Literally
,
``
the
basket
,
''
because
wedding
gifts
were
*NL*
originally
brought
in
such
a
receptacle
.
*NL*
*NL*
Furnished
with
this
plunder
,
Andrea
leaped
with
a
lighter
heart
from
the
*NL*
window
,
intending
to
slip
through
the
hands
of
the
gendarmes
.
Tall
and
*NL*
well
proportioned
as
an
ancient
gladiator
,
and
muscular
as
a
Spartan
,
*NL*
he
walked
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
without
knowing
where
to
direct
his
*NL*
steps
,
actuated
by
the
sole
idea
of
getting
away
from
the
spot
where
if
*NL*
he
lingered
he
knew
that
he
would
surely
be
taken
.
Having
passed
through
*NL*
the
Rue
Mont
Blanc
,
guided
by
the
instinct
which
leads
thieves
always
to
*NL*
take
the
safest
path
,
he
found
himself
at
the
end
of
the
Rue
Lafayette
.
*NL*
There
he
stopped
,
breathless
and
panting
.
He
was
quite
alone
;
on
one
*NL*
side
was
the
vast
wilderness
of
the
Saint-Lazare
,
on
the
other
,
Paris
*NL*
enshrouded
in
darkness
.
``
Am
I
to
be
captured
?
''
he
cried
;
``
no
,
not
if
I
*NL*
can
use
more
activity
than
my
enemies
.
My
safety
is
now
a
mere
question
*NL*
of
speed
.
''
At
this
moment
he
saw
a
cab
at
the
top
of
the
Faubourg
*NL*
Poissonniere
.
The
dull
driver
,
smoking
his
pipe
,
was
plodding
along
*NL*
toward
the
limits
of
the
Faubourg
Saint-Denis
,
where
no
doubt
he
*NL*
ordinarily
had
his
station
.
``
Ho
,
friend
!
''
said
Benedetto
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
want
,
sir
?
''
asked
the
driver
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
your
horse
tired
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tired
?
oh
,
yes
,
tired
enough
--
he
has
done
nothing
the
whole
of
this
*NL*
blessed
day
!
Four
wretched
fares
,
and
twenty
sous
over
,
making
in
all
*NL*
seven
francs
,
are
all
that
I
have
earned
,
and
I
ought
to
take
ten
to
the
*NL*
owner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
add
these
twenty
francs
to
the
seven
you
have
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
pleasure
,
sir
;
twenty
francs
are
not
to
be
despised
.
Tell
me
what
*NL*
I
am
to
do
for
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
very
easy
thing
,
if
your
horse
is
n't
tired
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
tell
you
he
'll
go
like
the
wind
,
--
only
tell
me
which
way
to
drive
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Towards
the
Louvres
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
I
know
the
way
--
you
get
good
sweetened
rum
over
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Exactly
so
;
I
merely
wish
to
overtake
one
of
my
friends
,
with
whom
I
am
*NL*
going
to
hunt
to-morrow
at
Chapelle-en-Serval
.
He
should
have
waited
for
*NL*
me
here
with
a
cabriolet
till
half-past
eleven
;
it
is
twelve
,
and
,
tired
*NL*
of
waiting
,
he
must
have
gone
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
likely
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
will
you
try
and
overtake
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
I
should
like
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
do
not
overtake
him
before
we
reach
Bourget
you
shall
have
*NL*
twenty
francs
;
if
not
before
Louvres
,
thirty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
if
we
do
overtake
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Forty
,
''
said
Andrea
,
after
a
moment
's
hesitation
,
at
the
end
of
which
*NL*
he
remembered
that
he
might
safely
promise
.
``
That
's
all
right
,
''
said
the
*NL*
man
;
``
hop
in
,
and
we
're
off
!
Who-o-o-p
,
la
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Andrea
got
into
the
cab
,
which
passed
rapidly
through
the
Faubourg
*NL*
Saint-Denis
,
along
the
Faubourg
Saint-Martin
,
crossed
the
barrier
,
and
*NL*
threaded
its
way
through
the
interminable
Villette
.
They
never
overtook
*NL*
the
chimerical
friend
,
yet
Andrea
frequently
inquired
of
people
on
foot
*NL*
whom
he
passed
and
at
the
inns
which
were
not
yet
closed
,
for
a
green
*NL*
cabriolet
and
bay
horse
;
and
as
there
are
a
great
many
cabriolets
to
be
*NL*
seen
on
the
road
to
the
Low
Countries
,
and
as
nine-tenths
of
them
are
*NL*
green
,
the
inquiries
increased
at
every
step
.
Every
one
had
just
seen
*NL*
it
pass
;
it
was
only
five
hundred
,
two
hundred
,
one
hundred
steps
in
*NL*
advance
;
at
length
they
reached
it
,
but
it
was
not
the
friend
.
Once
*NL*
the
cab
was
also
passed
by
a
calash
rapidly
whirled
along
by
two
*NL*
post-horses
.
``
Ah
,
''
said
Cavalcanti
to
himself
,
``
if
I
only
had
that
*NL*
britzska
,
those
two
good
post-horses
,
and
above
all
the
passport
*NL*
that
carries
them
on
!
''
And
he
sighed
deeply
.
The
calash
contained
*NL*
Mademoiselle
Danglars
and
Mademoiselle
d'Armilly
.
``
Hurry
,
hurry
!
''
said
*NL*
Andrea
,
``
we
must
overtake
him
soon
.
''
And
the
poor
horse
resumed
the
*NL*
desperate
gallop
it
had
kept
up
since
leaving
the
barrier
,
and
arrived
*NL*
steaming
at
Louvres
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
,
''
said
Andrea
,
``
I
shall
not
overtake
my
friend
,
but
I
shall
*NL*
kill
your
horse
,
therefore
I
had
better
stop
.
Here
are
thirty
francs
;
I
*NL*
will
sleep
at
the
Red
Horse
,
and
will
secure
a
place
in
the
first
coach
.
*NL*
Good-night
,
friend
.
''
And
Andrea
,
after
placing
six
pieces
of
five
francs
*NL*
each
in
the
man
's
hand
,
leaped
lightly
on
to
the
pathway
.
The
cabman
*NL*
joyfully
pocketed
the
sum
,
and
turned
back
on
his
road
to
Paris
.
Andrea
*NL*
pretended
to
go
towards
the
Red
Horse
inn
,
but
after
leaning
an
instant
*NL*
against
the
door
,
and
hearing
the
last
sound
of
the
cab
,
which
was
*NL*
disappearing
from
view
,
he
went
on
his
road
,
and
with
a
lusty
stride
*NL*
soon
traversed
the
space
of
two
leagues
.
Then
he
rested
;
he
must
be
near
*NL*
Chapelle-en-Serval
,
where
he
pretended
to
be
going
.
It
was
not
fatigue
*NL*
that
stayed
Andrea
here
;
it
was
that
he
might
form
some
resolution
,
*NL*
adopt
some
plan
.
It
would
be
impossible
to
make
use
of
a
diligence
,
*NL*
equally
so
to
engage
post-horses
;
to
travel
either
way
a
passport
was
*NL*
necessary
.
It
was
still
more
impossible
to
remain
in
the
department
of
*NL*
the
Oise
,
one
of
the
most
open
and
strictly
guarded
in
France
;
this
was
*NL*
quite
out
of
the
question
,
especially
to
a
man
like
Andrea
,
perfectly
*NL*
conversant
with
criminal
matters
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
sat
down
by
the
side
of
the
moat
,
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
and
*NL*
reflected
.
Ten
minutes
after
he
raised
his
head
;
his
resolution
was
*NL*
made
.
He
threw
some
dust
over
the
topcoat
,
which
he
had
found
time
to
*NL*
unhook
from
the
ante-chamber
and
button
over
his
ball
costume
,
and
going
*NL*
to
Chapelle-en-Serval
he
knocked
loudly
at
the
door
of
the
only
inn
in
*NL*
the
place
.
The
host
opened
.
``
My
friend
,
''
said
Andrea
,
``
I
was
coming
from
*NL*
Montefontaine
to
Senlis
,
when
my
horse
,
which
is
a
troublesome
creature
,
*NL*
stumbled
and
threw
me
.
I
must
reach
Compiegne
to-night
,
or
I
shall
cause
*NL*
deep
anxiety
to
my
family
.
Could
you
let
me
hire
a
horse
of
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
An
inn-keeper
has
always
a
horse
to
let
,
whether
it
be
good
or
bad
.
The
*NL*
host
called
the
stable-boy
,
and
ordered
him
to
saddle
``
Whitey
,
''
then
he
*NL*
awoke
his
son
,
a
child
of
seven
years
,
whom
he
ordered
to
ride
before
*NL*
the
gentleman
and
bring
back
the
horse
.
Andrea
gave
the
inn-keeper
*NL*
twenty
francs
,
and
in
taking
them
from
his
pocket
dropped
a
visiting
*NL*
card
.
This
belonged
to
one
of
his
friends
at
the
Cafe
de
Paris
,
so
that
*NL*
the
innkeeper
,
picking
it
up
after
Andrea
had
left
,
was
convinced
that
*NL*
he
had
let
his
horse
to
the
Count
of
Mauleon
,
25
Rue
Saint-Dominique
,
*NL*
that
being
the
name
and
address
on
the
card
.
``
Whitey
''
was
not
a
fast
*NL*
animal
,
but
he
kept
up
an
easy
,
steady
pace
;
in
three
hours
and
a
*NL*
half
Andrea
had
traversed
the
nine
leagues
which
separated
him
from
*NL*
Compiegne
,
and
four
o'clock
struck
as
he
reached
the
place
where
the
*NL*
coaches
stop
.
There
is
an
excellent
tavern
at
Compiegne
,
well
remembered
*NL*
by
those
who
have
ever
been
there
.
Andrea
,
who
had
often
stayed
there
*NL*
in
his
rides
about
Paris
,
recollected
the
Bell
and
Bottle
inn
;
he
*NL*
turned
around
,
saw
the
sign
by
the
light
of
a
reflected
lamp
,
and
having
*NL*
dismissed
the
child
,
giving
him
all
the
small
coin
he
had
about
him
,
he
*NL*
began
knocking
at
the
door
,
very
reasonably
concluding
that
having
now
*NL*
three
or
four
hours
before
him
he
had
best
fortify
himself
against
the
*NL*
fatigues
of
the
morrow
by
a
sound
sleep
and
a
good
supper
.
A
waiter
*NL*
opened
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
friend
,
''
said
Andrea
,
``
I
have
been
dining
at
Saint-Jean-au-Bois
,
and
*NL*
expected
to
catch
the
coach
which
passes
by
at
midnight
,
but
like
a
fool
*NL*
I
have
lost
my
way
,
and
have
been
walking
for
the
last
four
hours
in
the

forest

of
those
pretty
little
rooms
which
overlook
the
*NL*
court
,
and
bring
me
a
cold
fowl
and
a
bottle
of
Bordeaux
.
''
The
waiter
*NL*
had
no
suspicions
;
Andrea
spoke
with
perfect
composure
,
he
had
a
cigar
*NL*
in
his
mouth
,
and
his
hands
in
the
pocket
of
his
top
coat
;
his
clothes
*NL*
were
fashionably
made
,
his
chin
smooth
,
his
boots
irreproachable
;
he
*NL*
looked
merely
as
if
he
had
stayed
out
very
late
,
that
was
all
.
While
*NL*
the
waiter
was
preparing
his
room
,
the
hostess
arose
;
Andrea
assumed
*NL*
his
most
charming
smile
,
and
asked
if
he
could
have
No.
3
,
which
he
had
*NL*
occupied
on
his
last
stay
at
Compiegne
.
Unfortunately
,
No.
3
was
engaged
*NL*
by
a
young
man
who
was
travelling
with
his
sister
.
Andrea
appeared
in
*NL*
despair
,
but
consoled
himself
when
the
hostess
assured
him
that
No.
7
,
*NL*
prepared
for
him
,
was
situated
precisely
the
same
as
No.
3
,
and
while
*NL*
warming
his
feet
and
chatting
about
the
last
races
at
Chantilly
,
he
*NL*
waited
until
they
announced
his
room
to
be
ready
.
*NL*
*NL*
Andrea
had
not
spoken
without
cause
of
the
pretty
rooms
looking
out
upon
*NL*
the
court
of
the
Bell
Tavern
,
which
with
its
triple
galleries
like
those
*NL*
of
a
theatre
,
with
the
jessamine
and
clematis
twining
round
the
light
*NL*
columns
,
forms
one
of
the
prettiest
entrances
to
an
inn
that
you
*NL*
can
imagine
.
The
fowl
was
tender
,
the
wine
old
,
the
fire
clear
and
*NL*
sparkling
,
and
Andrea
was
surprised
to
find
himself
eating
with
as
good
*NL*
an
appetite
as
though
nothing
had
happened
.
Then
he
went
to
bed
and
*NL*
almost
immediately
fell
into
that
deep
sleep
which
is
sure
to
visit
men
*NL*
of
twenty
years
of
age
,
even
when
they
are
torn
with
remorse
.
Now
,
here
*NL*
we
are
obliged
to
own
that
Andrea
ought
to
have
felt
remorse
,
but
that
*NL*
he
did
not
.
This
was
the
plan
which
had
appealed
to
him
to
afford
the
*NL*
best
chance
of
his
security
.
Before
daybreak
he
would
awake
,
leave
the
*NL*
inn
after
rigorously
paying
his
bill
,
and
reaching
the
forest
,
he
would
,
*NL*
under
pretence
of
making
studies
in
painting
,
test
the
hospitality
of
*NL*
some
peasants
,
procure
himself
the
dress
of
a
woodcutter
and
a
hatchet
,
*NL*
casting
off
the
lion
's
skin
to
assume
that
of
the
woodman
;
then
,
with
*NL*
his
hands
covered
with
dirt
,
his
hair
darkened
by
means
of
a
leaden
*NL*
comb
,
his
complexion
embrowned
with
a
preparation
for
which
one
of
his
*NL*
old
comrades
had
given
him
the
recipe
,
he
intended
,
by
following
the
*NL*
wooded
districts
,
to
reach
the
nearest
frontier
,
walking
by
night
and
*NL*
sleeping
in
the
day
in
the
forests
and
quarries
,
and
only
entering
*NL*
inhabited
regions
to
buy
a
loaf
from
time
to
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
Once
past
the
frontier
,
Andrea
proposed
making
money
of
his
diamonds
;
*NL*
and
by
uniting
the
proceeds
to
ten
bank-notes
he
always
carried
about
*NL*
with
him
in
case
of
accident
,
he
would
then
find
himself
possessor
of
*NL*
about
50,000
livres
,
which
he
philosophically
considered
as
no
very
*NL*
deplorable
condition
after
all
.
Moreover
,
he
reckoned
much
on
*NL*
the
interest
of
the
Danglars
to
hush
up
the
rumor
of
their
own
*NL*
misadventures
.
These
were
the
reasons
which
,
added
to
the
fatigue
,
*NL*
caused
Andrea
to
sleep
so
soundly
.
In
order
that
he
might
awaken
early
*NL*
he
did
not
close
the
shutters
,
but
contented
himself
with
bolting
the
*NL*
door
and
placing
on
the
table
an
unclasped
and
long-pointed
knife
,
whose
*NL*
temper
he
well
knew
,
and
which
was
never
absent
from
him
.
About
seven
in
*NL*
the
morning
Andrea
was
awakened
by
a
ray
of
sunlight
,
which
played
,
*NL*
warm
and
brilliant
,
upon
his
face
.
In
all
well-organized
brains
,
the
*NL*
predominating
idea
--
and
there
always
is
one
--
is
sure
to
be
the
last
*NL*
thought
before
sleeping
,
and
the
first
upon
waking
in
the
morning
.
*NL*
Andrea
had
scarcely
opened
his
eyes
when
his
predominating
idea
*NL*
presented
itself
,
and
whispered
in
his
ear
that
he
had
slept
too
long
.
*NL*
He
jumped
out
of
bed
and
ran
to
the
window
.
A
gendarme
was
crossing
the
*NL*
court
.
A
gendarme
is
one
of
the
most
striking
objects
in
the
world
,
even
*NL*
to
a
man
void
of
uneasiness
;
but
for
one
who
has
a
timid
conscience
,
and
*NL*
with
good
cause
too
,
the
yellow
,
blue
,
and
white
uniform
is
really
very
*NL*
alarming
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
is
that
gendarme
there
?
''
asked
Andrea
of
himself
.
Then
,
all
at
*NL*
once
,
he
replied
,
with
that
logic
which
the
reader
has
,
doubtless
,
*NL*
remarked
in
him
,
``
There
is
nothing
astonishing
in
seeing
a
gendarme
at
*NL*
an
inn
;
instead
of
being
astonished
,
let
me
dress
myself
.
''
And
the
youth
*NL*
dressed
himself
with
a
facility
his
valet
de
chambre
had
failed
to
rob
*NL*
him
of
during
the
two
months
of
fashionable
life
he
had
led
in
Paris
.
*NL*
``
Now
then
,
''
said
Andrea
,
while
dressing
himself
,
``
I
'll
wait
till
he
*NL*
leaves
,
and
then
I
'll
slip
away
.
''
And
,
saying
this
,
Andrea
,
who
had
now
*NL*
put
on
his
boots
and
cravat
,
stole
gently
to
the
window
,
and
a
second
*NL*
time
lifted
up
the
muslin
curtain
.
Not
only
was
the
first
gendarme
still
*NL*
there
,
but
the
young
man
now
perceived
a
second
yellow
,
blue
,
and
white
*NL*
uniform
at
the
foot
of
the
staircase
,
the
only
one
by
which
he
could
*NL*
descend
,
while
a
third
,
on
horseback
,
holding
a
musket
in
his
fist
,
was
*NL*
posted
as
a
sentinel
at
the
great
street
door
which
alone
afforded
the
*NL*
means
of
egress
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
appearance
of
the
third
gendarme
settled
the
matter
,
for
a
crowd
*NL*
of
curious
loungers
was
extended
before
him
,
effectually
blocking
the
*NL*
entrance
to
the
hotel
.
``
They
're
after
me
!
''
was
Andrea
's
first
thought
.
*NL*
``
The
devil
!
''
A
pallor
overspread
the
young
man
's
forehead
,
and
he
looked
*NL*
around
him
with
anxiety
.
His
room
,
like
all
those
on
the
same
floor
,
had
*NL*
but
one
outlet
to
the
gallery
in
the
sight
of
everybody
.
``
I
am
lost
!
''
*NL*
was
his
second
thought
;
and
,
indeed
,
for
a
man
in
Andrea
's
situation
,
*NL*
an
arrest
meant
the
assizes
,
trial
,
and
death
,
--
death
without
mercy
or
*NL*
delay
.
For
a
moment
he
convulsively
pressed
his
head
within
his
hands
,
*NL*
and
during
that
brief
period
he
became
nearly
mad
with
terror
;
but
soon
*NL*
a
ray
of
hope
glimmered
in
the
multitude
of
thoughts
which
bewildered
*NL*
his
mind
,
and
a
faint
smile
played
upon
his
white
lips
and
pallid
*NL*
cheeks
.
He
looked
around
and
saw
the
objects
of
his
search
upon
the
*NL*
chimney-piece
;
they
were
a
pen
,
ink
,
and
paper
.
With
forced
composure
he
*NL*
dipped
the
pen
in
the
ink
,
and
wrote
the
following
lines
upon
a
sheet
of
*NL*
paper
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
no
money
to
pay
my
bill
,
but
I
am
not
a
dishonest
man
;
I
leave
*NL*
behind
me
as
a
pledge
this
pin
,
worth
ten
times
the
amount
.
I
shall
be
*NL*
excused
for
leaving
at
daybreak
,
for
I
was
ashamed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
then
drew
the
pin
from
his
cravat
and
placed
it
on
the
paper
.
This
*NL*
done
,
instead
of
leaving
the
door
fastened
,
he
drew
back
the
bolts
and
*NL*
even
placed
the
door
ajar
,
as
though
he
had
left
the
room
,
forgetting
*NL*
to
close
it
,
and
slipping
into
the
chimney
like
a
man
accustomed
to
that
*NL*
kind
of
gymnastic
exercise
,
having
effaced
the
marks
of
his
feet
upon
*NL*
the
floor
,
he
commenced
climbing
the
only
opening
which
afforded
him
*NL*
the
means
of
escape
.
At
this
precise
time
,
the
first
gendarme
Andrea
*NL*
had
noticed
walked
up-stairs
,
preceded
by
the
commissary
of
police
,
*NL*
and
supported
by
the
second
gendarme
who
guarded
the
staircase
and
was
*NL*
himself
re-enforced
by
the
one
stationed
at
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
Andrea
was
indebted
for
this
visit
to
the
following
circumstances
.
At
*NL*
daybreak
,
the
telegraphs
were
set
at
work
in
all
directions
,
and
almost
*NL*
immediately
the
authorities
in
every
district
had
exerted
their
utmost
*NL*
endeavors
to
arrest
the
murderer
of
Caderousse
.
Compiegne
,
that
royal
*NL*
residence
and
fortified
town
,
is
well
furnished
with
authorities
,
*NL*
gendarmes
,
and
commissaries
of
police
;
they
therefore
began
operations
*NL*
as
soon
as
the
telegraphic
despatch
arrived
,
and
the
Bell
and
Bottle
*NL*
being
the
best-known
hotel
in
the
town
,
they
had
naturally
directed
*NL*
their
first
inquiries
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
besides
the
reports
of
the
sentinels
guarding
the
Hotel
de
Ville
,
*NL*
which
is
next
door
to
the
Bell
and
Bottle
,
it
had
been
stated
by
others
*NL*
that
a
number
of
travellers
had
arrived
during
the
night
.
The
sentinel
*NL*
who
was
relieved
at
six
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
remembered
perfectly
*NL*
that
just
as
he
was
taking
his
post
a
few
minutes
past
four
a
young
*NL*
man
arrived
on
horseback
,
with
a
little
boy
before
him
.
The
young
man
,
*NL*
having
dismissed
the
boy
and
horse
,
knocked
at
the
door
of
the
hotel
,
*NL*
which
was
opened
,
and
again
closed
after
his
entrance
.
This
late
arrival
*NL*
had
attracted
much
suspicion
,
and
the
young
man
being
no
other
than
*NL*
Andrea
,
the
commissary
and
gendarme
,
who
was
a
brigadier
,
directed
their
*NL*
steps
towards
his
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
found
the
door
ajar
.
``
Oh
,
ho
,
''
said
the
brigadier
,
who
thoroughly
*NL*
understood
the
trick
;
``
a
bad
sign
to
find
the
door
open
!
I
would
rather
*NL*
find
it
triply
bolted
.
''
And
,
indeed
,
the
little
note
and
pin
upon
the
*NL*
table
confirmed
,
or
rather
corroborated
,
the
sad
truth
.
Andrea
had
fled
.
*NL*
We
say
corroborated
,
because
the
brigadier
was
too
experienced
to
be
*NL*
convinced
by
a
single
proof
.
He
glanced
around
,
looked
in
the
bed
,
shook
*NL*
the
curtains
,
opened
the
closets
,
and
finally
stopped
at
the
chimney
.
*NL*
Andrea
had
taken
the
precaution
to
leave
no
traces
of
his
feet
in
the
*NL*
ashes
,
but
still
it
was
an
outlet
,
and
in
this
light
was
not
to
be
*NL*
passed
over
without
serious
investigation
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
brigadier
sent
for
some
sticks
and
straw
,
and
having
filled
the
*NL*
chimney
with
them
,
set
a
light
to
it
.
The
fire
crackled
,
and
the
smoke
*NL*
ascended
like
the
dull
vapor
from
a
volcano
;
but
still
no
prisoner
fell
*NL*
down
,
as
they
expected
.
The
fact
was
,
that
Andrea
,
at
war
with
society
*NL*
ever
since
his
youth
,
was
quite
as
deep
as
a
gendarme
,
even
though
he
*NL*
were
advanced
to
the
rank
of
brigadier
,
and
quite
prepared
for
the
*NL*
fire
,
he
had
climbed
out
on
the
roof
and
was
crouching
down
against
*NL*
the
chimney-pots
.
At
one
time
he
thought
he
was
saved
,
for
he
heard
*NL*
the
brigadier
exclaim
in
a
loud
voice
,
to
the
two
gendarmes
,
``
He
is
not
*NL*
here
!
''
But
venturing
to
peep
,
he
perceived
that
the
latter
,
instead
of
*NL*
retiring
,
as
might
have
been
reasonably
expected
upon
this
announcement
,
*NL*
were
watching
with
increased
attention
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
now
his
turn
to
look
about
him
;
the
Hotel
de
Ville
,
a
massive
*NL*
sixteenth
century
building
,
was
on
his
right
;
any
one
could
descend
from
*NL*
the
openings
in
the
tower
,
and
examine
every
corner
of
the
roof
below
,
*NL*
and
Andrea
expected
momentarily
to
see
the
head
of
a
gendarme
appear
at
*NL*
one
of
these
openings
.
If
once
discovered
,
he
knew
he
would
be
lost
,
for
*NL*
the
roof
afforded
no
chance
of
escape
;
he
therefore
resolved
to
descend
,
*NL*
not
through
the
same
chimney
by
which
he
had
come
up
,
but
by
a
similar
*NL*
one
conducting
to
another
room
.
He
looked
around
for
a
chimney
from
*NL*
which
no
smoke
issued
,
and
having
reached
it
,
he
disappeared
through
the
*NL*
orifice
without
being
seen
by
any
one
.
At
the
same
minute
,
one
of
the
*NL*
little
windows
of
the
Hotel
de
Ville
was
thrown
open
,
and
the
head
of
a
*NL*
gendarme
appeared
.
For
an
instant
it
remained
motionless
as
one
of
*NL*
the
stone
decorations
of
the
building
,
then
after
a
long
sigh
of
*NL*
disappointment
the
head
disappeared
.
The
brigadier
,
calm
and
dignified
*NL*
as
the
law
he
represented
,
passed
through
the
crowd
,
without
answering
*NL*
the
thousand
questions
addressed
to
him
,
and
re-entered
the
hotel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
asked
the
two
gendarmes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
my
boys
,
''
said
the
brigadier
,
``
the
brigand
must
really
have
*NL*
escaped
early
this
morning
;
but
we
will
send
to
the
Villers-Coterets
and
*NL*
Noyon
roads
,
and
search
the
forest
,
when
we
shall
catch
him
,
no
doubt
.
''
*NL*
The
honorable
functionary
had
scarcely
expressed
himself
thus
,
in
that
*NL*
intonation
which
is
peculiar
to
brigadiers
of
the
gendarmerie
,
when
a
*NL*
loud
scream
,
accompanied
by
the
violent
ringing
of
a
bell
,
resounded
*NL*
through
the
court
of
the
hotel
.
``
Ah
,
what
is
that
?
''
cried
the
brigadier
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Some
traveller
seems
impatient
,
''
said
the
host
.
``
What
number
was
it
*NL*
that
rang
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Number
3
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Run
,
waiter
!
''
At
this
moment
the
screams
and
ringing
were
redoubled
.
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
said
the
brigadier
,
stopping
the
servant
,
``
the
person
who
is
*NL*
ringing
appears
to
want
something
more
than
a
waiter
;
we
will
attend
*NL*
upon
him
with
a
gendarme
.
Who
occupies
Number
3
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
little
fellow
who
arrived
last
night
in
a
post-chaise
with
his
*NL*
sister
,
and
who
asked
for
an
apartment
with
two
beds
.
''
The
bell
here
*NL*
rang
for
the
third
time
,
with
another
shriek
of
anguish
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Follow
me
,
Mr.
Commissary
!
''
said
the
brigadier
;
``
tread
in
my
steps
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait
an
instant
,
''
said
the
host
;
``
Number
3
has
two
staircases
,
--
inside
*NL*
and
outside
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
,
''
said
the
brigadier
.
``
I
will
take
charge
of
the
inside
one

Are
*NL*
the
carbines
loaded
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
brigadier

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
guard
the
exterior
,
and
if
he
attempts
to
fly
,
fire
upon
him
;
*NL*
he
must
be
a
great
criminal
,
from
what
the
telegraph
says

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
brigadier
,
followed
by
the
commissary
,
disappeared
by
the
inside
*NL*
staircase
,
accompanied
by
the
noise
which
his
assertions
respecting
*NL*
Andrea
had
excited
in
the
crowd
.
This
is
what
had
happened
.
Andrea
had
*NL*
very
cleverly
managed
to
descend
two-thirds
of
the
chimney
,
but
then
his
*NL*
foot
slipped
,
and
notwithstanding
his
endeavors
,
he
came
into
the
room
*NL*
with
more
speed
and
noise
than
he
intended
.
It
would
have
signified
*NL*
little
had
the
room
been
empty
,
but
unfortunately
it
was
occupied
.
Two
*NL*
ladies
,
sleeping
in
one
bed
,
were
awakened
by
the
noise
,
and
fixing
*NL*
their
eyes
upon
the
spot
whence
the
sound
proceeded
,
they
saw
a
man
.
*NL*
One
of
these
ladies
,
the
fair
one
,
uttered
those
terrible
shrieks
which
*NL*
resounded
through
the
house
,
while
the
other
,
rushing
to
the
bell-rope
,
*NL*
rang
with
all
her
strength
.
Andrea
,
as
we
can
see
,
was
surrounded
by
*NL*
misfortune
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
pity
's
sake
,
''
he
cried
,
pale
and
bewildered
,
without
seeing
whom
*NL*
he
was
addressing
,
--
``
for
pity
's
sake
do
not
call
assistance
!
Save
me
!
--
I
*NL*
will
not
harm
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Andrea
,
the
murderer
!
''
cried
one
of
the
ladies
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eugenie
!
Mademoiselle
Danglars
!
''
exclaimed
Andrea
,
stupefied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Help
,
help
!
''
cried
Mademoiselle
d'Armilly
,
taking
the
bell
from
her
*NL*
companion
's
hand
,
and
ringing
it
yet
more
violently
.
``
Save
me
,
I
am
*NL*
pursued
!
''
said
Andrea
,
clasping
his
hands
.
``
For
pity
,
for
mercy
's
sake
*NL*
do
not
deliver
me
up
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
too
late
,
they
are
coming
,
''
said
Eugenie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
conceal
me
somewhere
;
you
can
say
you
were
needlessly
alarmed
;
*NL*
you
can
turn
their
suspicions
and
save
my
life
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
ladies
,
pressing
closely
to
one
another
,
and
drawing
the
*NL*
bedclothes
tightly
around
them
,
remained
silent
to
this
supplicating
*NL*
voice
,
repugnance
and
fear
taking
possession
of
their
minds
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
be
it
so
,
''
at
length
said
Eugenie
;
``
return
by
the
same
road
you
*NL*
came
,
and
we
will
say
nothing
about
you
,
unhappy
wretch
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
he
is
,
here
he
is
!
''
cried
a
voice
from
the
landing
;
``
here
he
is
!
*NL*
I
see
him
!
''
The
brigadier
had
put
his
eye
to
the
keyhole
,
and
had
*NL*
discovered
Andrea
in
a
posture
of
entreaty
.
A
violent
blow
from
the
butt
*NL*
end
of
the
musket
burst
open
the
lock
,
two
more
forced
out
the
bolts
,
*NL*
and
the
broken
door
fell
in
.
Andrea
ran
to
the
other
door
,
leading
to
*NL*
the
gallery
,
ready
to
rush
out
;
but
he
was
stopped
short
,
and
he
stood
*NL*
with
his
body
a
little
thrown
back
,
pale
,
and
with
the
useless
knife
in
*NL*
his
clinched
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fly
,
then
!
''
cried
Mademoiselle
d'Armilly
,
whose
pity
returned
as
her
*NL*
fears
diminished
;
``
fly
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Or
kill
yourself
!
''
said
Eugenie
-LRB-
in
a
tone
which
a
Vestal
in
the
*NL*
amphitheatre
would
have
used
,
when
urging
the
victorious
gladiator
to
*NL*
finish
his
vanquished
adversary
-RRB-
.
Andrea
shuddered
,
and
looked
on
the
*NL*
young
girl
with
an
expression
which
proved
how
little
he
understood
such
*NL*
ferocious
honor
.
``
Kill
myself
?
''
he
cried
,
throwing
down
his
knife
;
``
why
*NL*
should
I
do
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
you
said
,
''
answered
Mademoiselle
Danglars
,
``
that
you
would
be
*NL*
condemned
to
die
like
the
worst
criminals
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bah
,
''
said
Cavalcanti
,
crossing
his
arms
,
``
one
has
friends
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
brigadier
advanced
to
him
,
sword
in
hand
.
``
Come
,
come
,
''
said
Andrea
,
*NL*
``
sheathe
your
sword
,
my
fine
fellow
;
there
is
no
occasion
to
make
such
a
*NL*
fuss
,
since
I
give
myself
up
;
''
and
he
held
out
his
hands
to
be
manacled
.
*NL*
The
girls
looked
with
horror
upon
this
shameful
metamorphosis
,
the
man
*NL*
of
the
world
shaking
off
his
covering
and
appearing
as
a
galley-slave
.
*NL*
Andrea
turned
towards
them
,
and
with
an
impertinent
smile
asked
,
--
``
Have
*NL*
you
any
message
for
your
father
,
Mademoiselle
Danglars
,
for
in
all
*NL*
probability
I
shall
return
to
Paris
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Eugenie
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
.
``
Oh
,
ho
!
''
said
Andrea
,
``
you
*NL*
need
not
be
ashamed
,
even
though
you
did
post
after
me
.
Was
I
not
nearly
*NL*
your
husband
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
with
this
raillery
Andrea
went
out
,
leaving
the
two
girls
a
prey
to
*NL*
their
own
feelings
of
shame
,
and
to
the
comments
of
the
crowd
.
An
hour
*NL*
after
they
stepped
into
their
calash
,
both
dressed
in
feminine
attire
.
*NL*
The
gate
of
the
hotel
had
been
closed
to
screen
them
from
sight
,
but
*NL*
they
were
forced
,
when
the
door
was
open
,
to
pass
through
a
throng
of
*NL*
curious
glances
and
whispering
voices
.
Eugenie
closed
her
eyes
;
but
*NL*
though
she
could
not
see
,
she
could
hear
,
and
the
sneers
of
the
crowd
*NL*
reached
her
in
the
carriage
.
``
Oh
,
why
is
not
the
world
a
wilderness
?
''
*NL*
she
exclaimed
,
throwing
herself
into
the
arms
of
Mademoiselle
d'Armilly
,
*NL*
her
eyes
sparkling
with
the
same
kind
of
rage
which
made
Nero
wish
that
*NL*
the
Roman
world
had
but
one
neck
,
that
he
might
sever
it
at
a
single
*NL*
blow
.
The
next
day
they
stopped
at
the
Hotel
de
Flandre
,
at
Brussels
.
*NL*
The
same
evening
Andrea
was
incarcerated
in
the
Conciergerie
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
99
.
The
Law
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
have
seen
how
quietly
Mademoiselle
Danglars
and
Mademoiselle
*NL*
d'Armilly
accomplished
their
transformation
and
flight
;
the
fact
being
*NL*
that
every
one
was
too
much
occupied
in
his
or
her
own
affairs
to
think
*NL*
of
theirs
.
We
will
leave
the
banker
contemplating
the
enormous
magnitude
*NL*
of
his
debt
before
the
phantom
of
bankruptcy
,
and
follow
the
baroness
,
*NL*
who
after
being
momentarily
crushed
under
the
weight
of
the
blow
which
*NL*
had
struck
her
,
had
gone
to
seek
her
usual
adviser
,
Lucien
Debray
.
The
*NL*
baroness
had
looked
forward
to
this
marriage
as
a
means
of
ridding
her
*NL*
of
a
guardianship
which
,
over
a
girl
of
Eugenie
's
character
,
could
not
*NL*
fail
to
be
rather
a
troublesome
undertaking
;
for
in
the
tacit
relations
*NL*
which
maintain
the
bond
of
family
union
,
the
mother
,
to
maintain
her
*NL*
ascendancy
over
her
daughter
,
must
never
fail
to
be
a
model
of
wisdom
*NL*
and
a
type
of
perfection
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
Madame
Danglars
feared
Eugenie
's
sagacity
and
the
influence
of
*NL*
Mademoiselle
d'Armilly
;
she
had
frequently
observed
the
contemptuous
*NL*
expression
with
which
her
daughter
looked
upon
Debray
,
--
an
expression
*NL*
which
seemed
to
imply
that
she
understood
all
her
mother
's
amorous
and
*NL*
pecuniary
relationships
with
the
intimate
secretary
;
moreover
,
she
*NL*
saw
that
Eugenie
detested
Debray
,
--
not
only
because
he
was
a
source
of
*NL*
dissension
and
scandal
under
the
paternal
roof
,
but
because
she
had
at
*NL*
once
classed
him
in
that
catalogue
of
bipeds
whom
Plato
endeavors
to
*NL*
withdraw
from
the
appellation
of
men
,
and
whom
Diogenes
designated
as
*NL*
animals
upon
two
legs
without
feathers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Unfortunately
,
in
this
world
of
ours
,
each
person
views
things
through
*NL*
a
certain
medium
,
and
so
is
prevented
from
seeing
in
the
same
light
as
*NL*
others
,
and
Madame
Danglars
,
therefore
,
very
much
regretted
that
the
*NL*
marriage
of
Eugenie
had
not
taken
place
,
not
only
because
the
match
was
*NL*
good
,
and
likely
to
insure
the
happiness
of
her
child
,
but
because
it
*NL*
would
also
set
her
at
liberty
.
She
ran
therefore
to
Debray
,
who
,
after
*NL*
having
like
the
rest
of
Paris
witnessed
the
contract
scene
and
the
*NL*
scandal
attending
it
,
had
retired
in
haste
to
his
club
,
where
he
was
*NL*
chatting
with
some
friends
upon
the
events
which
served
as
a
subject
of
*NL*
conversation
for
three-fourths
of
that
city
known
as
the
capital
of
the
*NL*
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
precise
time
when
Madame
Danglars
,
dressed
in
black
and
*NL*
concealed
in
a
long
veil
,
was
ascending
the
stairs
leading
to
Debray
's
*NL*
apartments
,
--
notwithstanding
the
assurances
of
the
concierge
that
*NL*
the
young
man
was
not
at
home
,
--
Debray
was
occupied
in
repelling
the
*NL*
insinuations
of
a
friend
,
who
tried
to
persuade
him
that
after
the
*NL*
terrible
scene
which
had
just
taken
place
he
ought
,
as
a
friend
of
the
*NL*
family
,
to
marry
Mademoiselle
Danglars
and
her
two
millions
.
Debray
did
*NL*
not
defend
himself
very
warmly
,
for
the
idea
had
sometimes
crossed
*NL*
his
mind
;
still
,
when
he
recollected
the
independent
,
proud
spirit
of
*NL*
Eugenie
,
he
positively
rejected
it
as
utterly
impossible
,
though
the
*NL*
same
thought
again
continually
recurred
and
found
a
resting-place
in
*NL*
his
heart
.
Tea
,
play
,
and
the
conversation
,
which
had
become
interesting
*NL*
during
the
discussion
of
such
serious
affairs
,
lasted
till
one
o'clock
*NL*
in
the
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
Madame
Danglars
,
veiled
and
uneasy
,
awaited
the
return
of
*NL*
Debray
in
the
little
green
room
,
seated
between
two
baskets
of
flowers
,
*NL*
which
she
had
that
morning
sent
,
and
which
,
it
must
be
confessed
,
Debray
*NL*
had
himself
arranged
and
watered
with
so
much
care
that
his
absence
was
*NL*
half
excused
in
the
eyes
of
the
poor
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
twenty
minutes
of
twelve
,
Madame
Danglars
,
tired
of
waiting
,
returned
*NL*
home
.
Women
of
a
certain
grade
are
like
prosperous
grisettes
in
one
*NL*
respect
,
they
seldom
return
home
after
twelve
o'clock
.
The
baroness
*NL*
returned
to
the
hotel
with
as
much
caution
as
Eugenie
used
in
leaving
*NL*
it
;
she
ran
lightly
up-stairs
,
and
with
an
aching
heart
entered
her
*NL*
apartment
,
contiguous
,
as
we
know
,
to
that
of
Eugenie
.
She
was
fearful
*NL*
of
exciting
any
remark
,
and
believed
firmly
in
her
daughter
's
innocence
*NL*
and
fidelity
to
the
paternal
roof
.
She
listened
at
Eugenie
's
door
,
and
*NL*
hearing
no
sound
tried
to
enter
,
but
the
bolts
were
in
place
.
Madame
*NL*
Danglars
then
concluded
that
the
young
girl
had
been
overcome
with
the
*NL*
terrible
excitement
of
the
evening
,
and
had
gone
to
bed
and
to
sleep
.
*NL*
She
called
the
maid
and
questioned
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mademoiselle
Eugenie
,
''
said
the
maid
,
``
retired
to
her
apartment
with
*NL*
Mademoiselle
d'Armilly
;
they
then
took
tea
together
,
after
which
they
*NL*
desired
me
to
leave
,
saying
that
they
needed
me
no
longer
.
''
Since
then
*NL*
the
maid
had
been
below
,
and
like
every
one
else
she
thought
the
young
*NL*
ladies
were
in
their
own
room
;
Madame
Danglars
,
therefore
,
went
to
bed
*NL*
without
a
shadow
of
suspicion
,
and
began
to
muse
over
the
recent
events
.
*NL*
In
proportion
as
her
memory
became
clearer
,
the
occurrences
of
the
*NL*
evening
were
revealed
in
their
true
light
;
what
she
had
taken
for
*NL*
confusion
was
a
tumult
;
what
she
had
regarded
as
something
distressing
,
*NL*
was
in
reality
a
disgrace
.
And
then
the
baroness
remembered
that
she
had
*NL*
felt
no
pity
for
poor
Mercedes
,
who
had
been
afflicted
with
as
severe
a
*NL*
blow
through
her
husband
and
son
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eugenie
,
''
she
said
to
herself
,
``
is
lost
,
and
so
are
we
.
The
affair
,
as
*NL*
it
will
be
reported
,
will
cover
us
with
shame
;
for
in
a
society
such
as
*NL*
ours
satire
inflicts
a
painful
and
incurable
wound
.
How
fortunate
that
*NL*
Eugenie
is
possessed
of
that
strange
character
which
has
so
often
*NL*
made
me
tremble
!
''
And
her
glance
was
turned
towards
heaven
,
where
a
*NL*
mysterious
providence
disposes
all
things
,
and
out
of
a
fault
,
nay
,
even
*NL*
a
vice
,
sometimes
produces
a
blessing
.
And
then
her
thoughts
,
cleaving
*NL*
through
space
like
a
bird
in
the
air
,
rested
on
Cavalcanti
.
This
Andrea
*NL*
was
a
wretch
,
a
robber
,
an
assassin
,
and
yet
his
manners
showed
the
*NL*
effects
of
a
sort
of
education
,
if
not
a
complete
one
;
he
had
been
*NL*
presented
to
the
world
with
the
appearance
of
an
immense
fortune
,
*NL*
supported
by
an
honorable
name
.
How
could
she
extricate
herself
from
*NL*
this
labyrinth
?
To
whom
would
she
apply
to
help
her
out
of
this
painful
*NL*
situation
?
Debray
,
to
whom
she
had
run
,
with
the
first
instinct
of
a
*NL*
woman
towards
the
man
she
loves
,
and
who
yet
betrays
her
,
--
Debray
could
*NL*
but
give
her
advice
,
she
must
apply
to
some
one
more
powerful
than
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
baroness
then
thought
of
M.
de
Villefort
.
It
was
M.
de
Villefort
who
*NL*
had
remorselessly
brought
misfortune
into
her
family
,
as
though
they
*NL*
had
been
strangers
.
But
,
no
;
on
reflection
,
the
procureur
was
not
a
*NL*
merciless
man
;
and
it
was
not
the
magistrate
,
slave
to
his
duties
,
but
*NL*
the
friend
,
the
loyal
friend
,
who
roughly
but
firmly
cut
into
the
very
*NL*
core
of
the
corruption
;
it
was
not
the
executioner
,
but
the
surgeon
,
who
*NL*
wished
to
withdraw
the
honor
of
Danglars
from
ignominious
association
*NL*
with
the
disgraced
young
man
they
had
presented
to
the
world
as
their
*NL*
son-in-law
.
And
since
Villefort
,
the
friend
of
Danglars
,
had
acted
in
*NL*
this
way
,
no
one
could
suppose
that
he
had
been
previously
acquainted
*NL*
with
,
or
had
lent
himself
to
,
any
of
Andrea
's
intrigues
.
Villefort
's
*NL*
conduct
,
therefore
,
upon
reflection
,
appeared
to
the
baroness
as
*NL*
if
shaped
for
their
mutual
advantage
.
But
the
inflexibility
of
the
*NL*
procureur
should
stop
there
;
she
would
see
him
the
next
day
,
and
if
she
*NL*
could
not
make
him
fail
in
his
duties
as
a
magistrate
,
she
would
,
at
*NL*
least
,
obtain
all
the
indulgence
he
could
allow
.
She
would
invoke
*NL*
the
past
,
recall
old
recollections
;
she
would
supplicate
him
by
the
*NL*
remembrance
of
guilty
,
yet
happy
days
.
M.
de
Villefort
would
stifle
the
*NL*
affair
;
he
had
only
to
turn
his
eyes
on
one
side
,
and
allow
Andrea
to
*NL*
fly
,
and
follow
up
the
crime
under
that
shadow
of
guilt
called
contempt
*NL*
of
court
.
And
after
this
reasoning
she
slept
easily
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
nine
o'clock
next
morning
she
arose
,
and
without
ringing
for
her
maid
*NL*
or
giving
the
least
sign
of
her
activity
,
she
dressed
herself
in
the
*NL*
same
simple
style
as
on
the
previous
night
;
then
running
down-stairs
,
*NL*
she
left
the
hotel
,
walked
to
the
Rue
de
Provence
,
called
a
cab
,
and
*NL*
drove
to
M.
de
Villefort
's
house
.
For
the
last
month
this
wretched
house
*NL*
had
presented
the
gloomy
appearance
of
a
lazaretto
infected
with
the
*NL*
plague
.
Some
of
the
apartments
were
closed
within
and
without
;
the
*NL*
shutters
were
only
opened
to
admit
a
minute
's
air
,
showing
the
scared
*NL*
face
of
a
footman
,
and
immediately
afterwards
the
window
would
be
*NL*
closed
,
like
a
gravestone
falling
on
a
sepulchre
,
and
the
neighbors
*NL*
would
say
to
each
other
in
a
low
voice
,
``
Will
there
be
another
funeral
*NL*
to-day
at
the
procureur
's
house
?
''
Madame
Danglars
involuntarily
*NL*
shuddered
at
the
desolate
aspect
of
the
mansion
;
descending
from
the
*NL*
cab
,
she
approached
the
door
with
trembling
knees
,
and
rang
the
bell
.
*NL*
Three
times
did
the
bell
ring
with
a
dull
,
heavy
sound
,
seeming
to
*NL*
participate
,
in
the
general
sadness
,
before
the
concierge
appeared
and
*NL*
peeped
through
the
door
,
which
he
opened
just
wide
enough
to
allow
his
*NL*
words
to
be
heard
.
He
saw
a
lady
,
a
fashionable
,
elegantly
dressed
lady
,
*NL*
and
yet
the
door
remained
almost
closed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
intend
opening
the
door
?
''
said
the
baroness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
First
,
madame
,
who
are
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
am
I
?
You
know
me
well
enough
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
no
longer
know
any
one
,
madame
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
be
mad
,
my
friend
,
''
said
the
baroness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
do
you
come
from
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
this
is
too
much
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madame
,
these
are
my
orders
;
excuse
me
.
Your
name
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
baroness
Danglars
;
you
have
seen
me
twenty
times
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Possibly
,
madame
.
And
now
,
what
do
you
want
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
how
extraordinary
!
I
shall
complain
to
M.
de
Villefort
of
the
*NL*
impertinence
of
his
servants
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madame
,
this
is
precaution
,
not
impertinence
;
no
one
enters
here
*NL*
without
an
order
from
M.
d'Avrigny
,
or
without
speaking
to
the
*NL*
procureur
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
have
business
with
the
procureur
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
pressing
business
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
imagine
so
,
since
I
have
not
even
brought
my
carriage
out
yet
.
*NL*
But
enough
of
this
--
here
is
my
card
,
take
it
to
your
master
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madame
will
await
my
return
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
go
.
''
The
concierge
closed
the
door
,
leaving
Madame
Danglars
in
*NL*
the
street
.
She
had
not
long
to
wait
;
directly
afterwards
the
door
was
*NL*
opened
wide
enough
to
admit
her
,
and
when
she
had
passed
through
,
it
was
*NL*
again
shut
.
Without
losing
sight
of
her
for
an
instant
,
the
concierge
*NL*
took
a
whistle
from
his
pocket
as
soon
as
they
entered
the
court
,
and
*NL*
blew
it
.
The
valet
de
chambre
appeared
on
the
door-steps
.
``
You
will
*NL*
excuse
this
poor
fellow
,
madame
,
''
he
said
,
as
he
preceded
the
baroness
,
*NL*
``
but
his
orders
are
precise
,
and
M.
de
Villefort
begged
me
to
tell
you
*NL*
that
he
could
not
act
otherwise
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
court
showing
his
merchandise
,
was
a
tradesman
who
had
been
*NL*
admitted
with
the
same
precautions
.
The
baroness
ascended
the
steps
;
she
*NL*
felt
herself
strongly
infected
with
the
sadness
which
seemed
to
magnify
*NL*
her
own
,
and
still
guided
by
the
valet
de
chambre
,
who
never
lost
sight
*NL*
of
her
for
an
instant
,
she
was
introduced
to
the
magistrate
's
study
.
*NL*
Preoccupied
as
Madame
Danglars
had
been
with
the
object
of
her
visit
,
*NL*
the
treatment
she
had
received
from
these
underlings
appeared
to
her
so
*NL*
insulting
,
that
she
began
by
complaining
of
it
.
But
Villefort
,
raising
*NL*
his
head
,
bowed
down
by
grief
,
looked
up
at
her
with
so
sad
a
smile
that
*NL*
her
complaints
died
upon
her
lips
.
``
Forgive
my
servants
,
''
he
said
,
``
for
*NL*
a
terror
I
can
not
blame
them
for
;
from
being
suspected
they
have
become
*NL*
suspicious
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Danglars
had
often
heard
of
the
terror
to
which
the
magistrate
*NL*
alluded
,
but
without
the
evidence
of
her
own
eyesight
she
could
never
*NL*
have
believed
that
the
sentiment
had
been
carried
so
far
.
``
You
too
,
*NL*
then
,
are
unhappy
?
''
she
said
.
``
Yes
,
madame
,
''
replied
the
magistrate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
pity
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sincerely
,
madame
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
understand
what
brings
me
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
wish
to
speak
to
me
about
the
circumstance
which
has
just
*NL*
happened
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
,
--
a
fearful
misfortune
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
mean
a
mischance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
mischance
?
''
repeated
the
baroness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas
,
madame
,
''
said
the
procureur
with
his
imperturbable
calmness
of
*NL*
manner
,
``
I
consider
those
alone
misfortunes
which
are
irreparable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
do
you
suppose
this
will
be
forgotten
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Everything
will
be
forgotten
,
madame
,
''
said
Villefort
.
``
Your
daughter
*NL*
will
be
married
to-morrow
,
if
not
to-day
--
in
a
week
,
if
not
to-morrow
;
*NL*
and
I
do
not
think
you
can
regret
the
intended
husband
of
your
*NL*
daughter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Danglars
gazed
on
Villefort
,
stupefied
to
find
him
so
almost
*NL*
insultingly
calm
.
``
Am
I
come
to
a
friend
?
''
she
asked
in
a
tone
full
of
*NL*
mournful
dignity
.
``
You
know
that
you
are
,
madame
,
''
said
Villefort
,
whose
*NL*
pale
cheeks
became
slightly
flushed
as
he
gave
her
the
assurance
.
And
*NL*
truly
this
assurance
carried
him
back
to
different
events
from
those
now
*NL*
occupying
the
baroness
and
him
.
``
Well
,
then
,
be
more
affectionate
,
my
*NL*
dear
Villefort
,
''
said
the
baroness
.
``
Speak
to
me
not
as
a
magistrate
,
*NL*
but
as
a
friend
;
and
when
I
am
in
bitter
anguish
of
spirit
,
do
not
tell
*NL*
me
that
I
ought
to
be
gay
.
''
Villefort
bowed
.
``
When
I
hear
misfortunes
*NL*
named
,
madame
,
''
he
said
,
``
I
have
within
the
last
few
months
contracted
*NL*
the
bad
habit
of
thinking
of
my
own
,
and
then
I
can
not
help
drawing
up
*NL*
an
egotistical
parallel
in
my
mind
.
That
is
the
reason
that
by
the
side
*NL*
of
my
misfortunes
yours
appear
to
me
mere
mischances
;
that
is
why
my
*NL*
dreadful
position
makes
yours
appear
enviable

But
this
annoys
you

let
*NL*
us
change
the
subject

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
came
to
ask
you

with
this
impostor

*NL*
*NL*
``
Impostor

repeated
Villefort
;

extenuate
some

Impostor

M.

Andrea
Cavalcanti

rather
M.

nothing

an
assassin

*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir

I
do
not
deny
the
justice

unfortunate
man

the
more
deeply
*NL*
will
you
strike
our

forget
him

instead

pursuing
him
let
him
go

*NL*
*NL*
``
You

The
procureur
shook
his

head
.
``
At

keep
him
there
till
my

said
the

half
jesting

half
in

``
For

Villefort

*NL*
``
Ah

exclaimed
the
baroness
,
without
expressing
the
ideas

the
*NL*
exclamation
betrayed
.
Villefort
looked
at
her
with
that
piercing
glance
*NL*
which
reads
the
secrets
of
the
heart
.
``
Yes
,
I
know
what
you
mean

he
*NL*
said
;
``
you
refer

in
mourning

quickly

The

Villefort
drew
his
armchair
nearer
to
Madame
Danglars
;
then
resting
both
*NL*
hands
upon
his
desk
he
said
in
a
voice
more
hollow
than
usual
:
``
There
*NL*
are
crimes

remain
unpunished

innocent

guilty

-LRB-
Villefort
here
extended
his
hand
toward
a
*NL*
large
crucifix
placed
opposite
to
his
desk

--
``

``
Villefort

she
exclaimed
in
her
softest
and
most
*NL*
captivating
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
heaven
's
sake
,
madame
,
''
said
Villefort
,
with
a
firmness
of
*NL*
expression
not
altogether
free
from
harshness
--
``
for
heaven
's
sake
,
do
*NL*
not
ask
pardon
of
me
for
a
guilty
wretch
!
What
am
I
?
--
the
law
.
Has
the
*NL*
law
any
eyes
to
witness
your
grief
?
Has
the
law
ears
to
be
melted
by
*NL*
your
sweet
voice
?
Has
the
law
a
memory
for
all
those
soft
recollections
*NL*
you
endeavor
to
recall
?
No
,
madame
;
the
law
has
commanded
,
and
when
it
*NL*
commands
it
strikes
.
You
will
tell
me
that
I
am
a
living
being
,
and
not
*NL*
a
code
--
a
man
,
and
not
a
volume
.
Look
at
me
,
madame
--
look
around
me
.
*NL*
Have
mankind
treated
me
as
a
brother
?
Have
they
loved
me
?
Have
they
*NL*
spared
me
?
Has
any
one
shown
the
mercy
towards
me
that
you
now
ask
at
my
*NL*
hands
?
No
,
madame
,
they
struck
me
,
always
struck
me
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Woman
,
siren
that
you
are
,
do
you
persist
in
fixing
on
me
that
*NL*
fascinating
eye
,
which
reminds
me
that
I
ought
to
blush
?
Well
,
be
it
so
;
*NL*
let
me
blush
for
the
faults
you
know
,
and
perhaps
--
perhaps
for
even
*NL*
more
than
those
!
But
having
sinned
myself
,
--
it
may
be
more
deeply
*NL*
than
others
,
--
I
never
rest
till
I
have
torn
the
disguises
from
my
*NL*
fellow-creatures
,
and
found
out
their
weaknesses
.
I
have
always
found
*NL*
them
;
and
more
,
--
I
repeat
it
with
joy
,
with
triumph
,
--
I
have
always
*NL*
found
some
proof
of
human
perversity
or
error
.
Every
criminal
I
condemn
*NL*
seems
to
me
living
evidence
that
I
am
not
a
hideous
exception
to
the
*NL*
rest
.
Alas
,
alas
,
alas
;
all
the
world
is
wicked
;
let
us
therefore
strike
*NL*
at
wickedness
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Villefort
pronounced
these
last
words
with
a
feverish
rage
,
which
gave
a
*NL*
ferocious
eloquence
to
his
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
''
'
said
Madame
Danglars
,
resolving
to
make
a
last
effort
,
``
this
*NL*
young
man
,
though
a
murderer
,
is
an
orphan
,
abandoned
by
everybody
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
much
the
worse
,
or
rather
,
so
much
the
better
;
it
has
been
so
*NL*
ordained

may
have
none
to
weep
his
fate

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
this
is
trampling
on
the
weak

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
weakness
of
a
murderer
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
His
dishonor
reflects
upon

*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
not
death
in
my

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

''
exclaimed
the
baroness
,
``
you
are
without

I
tell
you
they

*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
it
so

said
Villefort
,
raising
his
arms
to
heaven
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At

delay
the
trial

shall
then
have
six

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

said
Villefort
;
``

have
been

There
are

yet
five

Do
you
not
think
*NL*
that
I
also
long
for
forgetfulness
?
While
working
night
and
day
,
I
*NL*
sometimes
lose
all
recollection
of
the
past
,
and
then
I
experience
the
*NL*
same
sort
of
happiness
I
can
imagine
the
dead
feel
;
still
,
it
is
better
*NL*
than
suffering

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
sir
,
he
has
fled

let
him
escape

inaction
is
a
pardonable
*NL*
offence

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
tell
you
it
is
too
late
;
early
this
morning
the
telegraph
was
*NL*
employed

and
at
this
very
minute
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir

said
the
valet
de

,
entering
the
room
,
``
a
dragoon

*NL*
brought
this
despatch

Villefort
*NL*
seized
the
letter
,
and
hastily
broke
the
seal
.
Madame
Danglars
trembled
*NL*
with
fear
;
Villefort
started
with
joy
.
``
Arrested

''
he
exclaimed
;
``
he
*NL*
was
taken
at
Compiegne

is
over

Madame
Danglars
rose
from
her

pale
and
cold
.
``
Adieu

she
said
.
``
Adieu

replied
*NL*
the
king

attorney
,
as
in
an
almost
joyful
manner
he
conducted
her

the
door

Then
,
turning
to

he
said

striking
the

the
back

Chapter
100
.
The
Apparition
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
procureur
had
told
Madame
Danglars
,
Valentine
was
not
yet
*NL*
recovered
.
Bowed
down
with
fatigue
,
she
was
indeed
confined
to
her
bed
;
*NL*
and
it
was
in
her
own
room
,
and
from
the
lips
of
Madame
de
Villefort
,
*NL*
that
she
heard
all
the
strange
events
we
have
related
,
--
we
mean
the
*NL*
flight
of
Eugenie
and
the
arrest
of
Andrea
Cavalcanti
,
or
rather
*NL*
Benedetto
,
together
with
the
accusation
of
murder
pronounced
against
*NL*
him
.
But
Valentine
was
so
weak
that
this
recital
scarcely
produced
*NL*
the
same
effect
it
would
have
done
had
she
been
in
her
usual
state
of
*NL*
health
.
Indeed
,
her
brain
was
only
the
seat
of
vague
ideas
,
and
confused
*NL*
forms
,
mingled
with
strange
fancies
,
alone
presented
themselves
before
*NL*
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
daytime
Valentine
's
perceptions
remained
tolerably
clear
,
*NL*
owing
to
the
constant
presence
of
M.
Noirtier
,
who
caused
himself
to
be
*NL*
carried
to
his
granddaughter
's
room
,
and
watched
her
with
his
paternal
*NL*
tenderness
;
Villefort
also
,
on
his
return
from
the
law
courts
,
*NL*
frequently
passed
an
hour
or
two
with
his
father
and
child
.
At
six
*NL*
o'clock
Villefort
retired
to
his
study
,
at
eight
M.
d'Avrigny
himself
*NL*
arrived
,
bringing
the
night
draught
prepared
for
the
young
girl
,
and
*NL*
then
M.
Noirtier
was
carried
away
.
A
nurse
of
the
doctor
's
choice
*NL*
succeeded
them
,
and
never
left
till
about
ten
or
eleven
o'clock
,
when
*NL*
Valentine
was
asleep
.
As
she
went
down-stairs
she
gave
the
keys
of
*NL*
Valentine
's
room
to
M.
de
Villefort
,
so
that
no
one
could
reach
the
*NL*
sick-room
excepting
through
that
of
Madame
de
Villefort
and
little
*NL*
Edward
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
morning
Morrel
called
on
Noirtier
to
receive
news
of
Valentine
,
*NL*
and
,
extraordinary
as
it
seemed
,
each
day
found
him
less
uneasy
.
*NL*
Certainly
,
though
Valentine
still
labored
under
dreadful
nervous
*NL*
excitement
,
she
was
better
;
and
moreover
,
Monte
Cristo
had
told
him
*NL*
when
,
half
distracted
,
he
had
rushed
to
the
count
's
house
,
that
if
*NL*
she
were
not
dead
in
two
hours
she
would
be
saved
.
Now
four
days
had
*NL*
elapsed
,
and
Valentine
still
lived
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
nervous
excitement
of
which
we
speak
pursued
Valentine
even
in
her
*NL*
sleep
,
or
rather
in
that
state
of
somnolence
which
succeeded
her
waking
*NL*
hours
;
it
was
then
,
in
the
silence
of
night
,
in
the
dim
light
shed
from
*NL*
the
alabaster
lamp
on
the
chimney-piece
,
that
she
saw
the
shadows
pass
*NL*
and
repass
which
hover
over
the
bed
of
sickness
,
and
fan
the
fever
*NL*
with
their
trembling
wings
.
First
she
fancied
she
saw
her
stepmother
*NL*
threatening
her
,
then
Morrel
stretched
his
arms
towards
her
;
sometimes
*NL*
mere
strangers
,
like
the
Count
of
Monte
Cristo
came
to
visit
her
;
even
*NL*
the
very
furniture
,
in
these
moments
of
delirium
,
seemed
to
move
,
and
*NL*
this
state
lasted
till
about
three
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
when
a
deep
,
*NL*
heavy
slumber
overcame
the
young
girl
,
from
which
she
did
not
awake
till
*NL*
daylight
.
On
the
evening
of
the
day
on
which
Valentine
had
learned
of
*NL*
the
flight
of
Eugenie
and
the
arrest
of
Benedetto
,
--
Villefort
having
*NL*
retired
as
well
as
Noirtier
and
d'Avrigny
,
--
her
thoughts
wandered
in
a
*NL*
confused
maze
,
alternately
reviewing
her
own
situation
and
the
events
*NL*
she
had
just
heard
.
*NL*
*NL*
Eleven
o'clock
had
struck
.
The
nurse
,
having
placed
the
beverage
*NL*
prepared
by
the
doctor
within
reach
of
the
patient
,
and
locked
the
*NL*
door
,
was
listening
with
terror
to
the
comments
of
the
servants
in
the
*NL*
kitchen
,
and
storing
her
memory
with
all
the
horrible
stories
which
had
*NL*
for
some
months
past
amused
the
occupants
of
the
ante-chambers
in
the
*NL*
house
of
the
king
's
attorney
.
Meanwhile
an
unexpected
scene
was
passing
*NL*
in
the
room
which
had
been
so
carefully
locked
.
Ten
minutes
had
elapsed
*NL*
since
the
nurse
had
left
;
Valentine
,
who
for
the
last
hour
had
*NL*
been
suffering
from
the
fever
which
returned
nightly
,
incapable
of
*NL*
controlling
her
ideas
,
was
forced
to
yield
to
the
excitement
which
*NL*
exhausted
itself
in
producing
and
reproducing
a
succession
and
*NL*
recurrence
of
the
same
fancies
and
images
.
The
night-lamp
threw
out
*NL*
countless
rays
,
each
resolving
itself
into
some
strange
form
to
her
*NL*
disordered
imagination
,
when
suddenly
by
its
flickering
light
Valentine
*NL*
thought
she
saw
the
door
of
her
library
,
which
was
in
the
recess
by
the
*NL*
chimney-piece
,
open
slowly
,
though
she
in
vain
listened
for
the
sound
of
*NL*
the
hinges
on
which
it
turned
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
any
other
time
Valentine
would
have
seized
the
silken
bell-pull
*NL*
and
summoned
assistance
,
but
nothing
astonished
her
in
her
present
*NL*
situation
.
Her
reason
told
her
that
all
the
visions
she
beheld
were
but
*NL*
the
children
of
her
imagination
,
and
the
conviction
was
strengthened
*NL*
by
the
fact
that
in
the
morning
no
traces
remained
of
the
nocturnal
*NL*
phantoms
,
who
disappeared
with
the
coming
of
daylight
.
From
behind
the
*NL*
door
a
human
figure
appeared
,
but
the
girl
was
too
familiar
with
*NL*
such
apparitions
to
be
alarmed
,
and
therefore
only
stared
,
hoping
to
*NL*
recognize
Morrel
.
The
figure
advanced
towards
the
bed
and
appeared
to
*NL*
listen
with
profound
attention
.
At
this
moment
a
ray
of
light
glanced
*NL*
across
the
face
of
the
midnight
visitor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
not
he
,
''
she
murmured
,
and
waited
,
in
the
assurance
that
this
was
*NL*
but
a
dream
,
for
the
man
to
disappear
or
assume
some
other
form
.
Still
,
*NL*
she
felt
her
pulse
,
and
finding
it
throb
violently
she
remembered
that
*NL*
the
best
method
of
dispelling
such
illusions
was
to
drink
,
for
a
draught
*NL*
of
the
beverage
prepared
by
the
doctor
to
allay
her
fever
seemed
to
*NL*
cause
a
reaction
of
the
brain
,
and
for
a
short
time
she
suffered
less
.
*NL*
Valentine
therefore
reached
her
hand
towards
the
glass
,
but
as
soon
*NL*
as
her
trembling
arm
left
the
bed
the
apparition
advanced
more
quickly
*NL*
towards
her
,
and
approached
the
young
girl
so
closely
that
she
fancied
*NL*
she
heard
his
breath
,
and
felt
the
pressure
of
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
time
the
illusion
,
or
rather
the
reality
,
surpassed
anything
*NL*
Valentine
had
before
experienced
;
she
began
to
believe
herself
really
*NL*
alive
and
awake
,
and
the
belief
that
her
reason
was
this
time
not
*NL*
deceived
made
her
shudder
.
The
pressure
she
felt
was
evidently
intended
*NL*
to
arrest
her
arm
,
and
she
slowly
withdrew
it
.
Then
the
figure
,
from
*NL*
whom
she
could
not
detach
her
eyes
,
and
who
appeared
more
protecting
*NL*
than
menacing
,
took
the
glass
,
and
walking
towards
the
night-light
held
*NL*
it
up
,
as
if
to
test
its
transparency
.
This
did
not
seem
sufficient
;
*NL*
the
man
,
or
rather
the
ghost
--
for
he
trod
so
softly
that
no
sound
was
*NL*
heard
--
then
poured
out
about
a
spoonful
into
the
glass
,
and
drank
it
.
*NL*
Valentine
witnessed
this
scene
with
a
sentiment
of
stupefaction
.
Every
*NL*
minute
she
had
expected
that
it
would
vanish
and
give
place
to
another
*NL*
vision
;
but
the
man
,
instead
of
dissolving
like
a
shadow
,
again
*NL*
approached
her
,
and
said
in
an
agitated
voice
,
``
Now
you
may
drink
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Valentine
shuddered
.
It
was
the
first
time
one
of
these
visions
had
*NL*
ever
addressed
her
in
a
living
voice
,
and
she
was
about
to
utter
an
*NL*
exclamation
.
The
man
placed
his
finger
on
her
lips
.
``
The
Count
of
Monte
*NL*
Cristo
!
''
she
murmured
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
easy
to
see
that
no
doubt
now
remained
in
the
young
girl
's
mind
*NL*
as
to
the
reality
of
the
scene
;
her
eyes
started
with
terror
,
her
hands
*NL*
trembled
,
and
she
rapidly
drew
the
bedclothes
closer
to
her
.
Still
,
the
*NL*
presence
of
Monte
Cristo
at
such
an
hour
,
his
mysterious
,
fanciful
,
and
*NL*
extraordinary
entrance
into
her
room
through
the
wall
,
might
well
seem
*NL*
impossibilities
to
her
shattered
reason
.
``
Do
not
call
any
one
--
do
not
be
*NL*
alarmed
,
''
said
the
Count
;
``
do
not
let
a
shade
of
suspicion
or
uneasiness
*NL*
remain
in
your
breast
;
the
man
standing
before
you
,
Valentine
-LRB-
for
this
*NL*
time
it
is
no
ghost
-RRB-
,
is
nothing
more
than
the
tenderest
father
and
the
*NL*
most
respectful
friend
you
could
dream
of
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Valentine
could
not
reply
;
the
voice
which
indicated
the
real
presence
*NL*
of
a
being
in
the
room
,
alarmed
her
so
much
that
she
feared
to
utter
a
*NL*
syllable
;
still
the
expression
of
her
eyes
seemed
to
inquire
,
``
If
your
*NL*
intentions
are
pure
,
why
are
you
here
?
''
The
count
's
marvellous
sagacity
*NL*
understood
all
that
was
passing
in
the
young
girl
's
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
to
me
,
''
he
said
,
``
or
,
rather
,
look
upon
me
;
look
at
my
face
,
*NL*
paler
even
than
usual
,
and
my
eyes
,
red
with
weariness
--
for
four
days
*NL*
I
have
not
closed
them
,
for
I
have
been
constantly
watching
you
,
to
*NL*
protect
and
preserve
you
for
Maximilian
.
''
The
blood
mounted
rapidly
*NL*
to
the
cheeks
of
Valentine
,
for
the
name
just
announced
by
the
count
*NL*
dispelled
all
the
fear
with
which
his
presence
had
inspired
her
.
*NL*
``
Maximilian
!
''
she
exclaimed
,
and
so
sweet
did
the
sound
appear
to
her
,
*NL*
that
she
repeated
it
--
``
Maximilian
!
--
has
he
then
owned
all
to
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Everything
.
He
told
me
your
life
was
his
,
and
I
have
promised
him
that
*NL*
you
shall
live
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
promised
him
that
I
shall
live
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
sir
,
you
spoke
of
vigilance
and
protection
.
Are
you
a
doctor
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
the
best
you
could
have
at
the
present
time
,
believe
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
say
you
have
watched
?
''
said
Valentine
uneasily
;
``
where
have
*NL*
you
been
?
--
I
have
not
seen
you
.
''
The
count
extended
his
hand
towards
the
*NL*
library
.
``
I
was
hidden
behind
that
door
,
''
he
said
,
``
which
leads
into
the
*NL*
next
house
,
which
I
have
rented
.
''
Valentine
turned
her
eyes
away
,
and
,
*NL*
with
an
indignant
expression
of
pride
and
modest
fear
,
exclaimed
:
``
Sir
,
*NL*
I
think
you
have
been
guilty
of
an
unparalleled
intrusion
,
and
that
what
*NL*
you
call
protection
is
more
like
an
insult
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Valentine
,
''
he
answered
,
``
during
my
long
watch
over
you
,
all
I
*NL*
have
observed
has
been
what
people
visited
you
,
what
nourishment
was
*NL*
prepared
,
and
what
beverage
was
served
;
then
,
when
the
latter
appeared
*NL*
dangerous
to
me
,
I
entered
,
as
I
have
now
done
,
and
substituted
,
in
the
*NL*
place
of
the
poison
,
a
healthful
draught
;
which
,
instead
of
producing
*NL*
the
death
intended
,
caused
life
to
circulate
in
your
veins
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poison
--
death
!
''
exclaimed
Valentine
,
half
believing
herself
under
the
*NL*
influence
of
some
feverish
hallucination
;
``
what
are
you
saying
,
sir
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hush
,
my
child
,
''
said
Monte
Cristo
,
again
placing
his
finger
upon
her
*NL*
lips
,
``
I
did
say
poison
and
death
.
But
drink
some
of
this
;
''
and
the
*NL*
count
took
a
bottle
from
his
pocket
,
containing
a
red
liquid
,
of
which
*NL*
he
poured
a
few
drops
into
the
glass
.
``
Drink
this
,
and
then
take
nothing
*NL*
more
to-night
.
''
Valentine
stretched
out
her
hand
,
but
scarcely
had
she
*NL*
touched
the
glass
when
she
drew
back
in
fear
.
Monte
Cristo
took
the
*NL*
glass
,
drank
half
its
contents
,
and
then
presented
it
to
Valentine
,
who
*NL*
smiled
and
swallowed
the
rest
.
``
Oh
,
yes
,
''
she
exclaimed
,
``
I
recognize
*NL*
the
flavor
of
my
nocturnal
beverage
which
refreshed
me
so
much
,
and
*NL*
seemed
to
ease
my
aching
brain
.
Thank
you
,
sir

thank
you
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
how
you
have
lived
during
the
last
four
nights

Valentine

''
*NL*
said
the
count
.
``
But
,
oh
,
how
I
passed
that
time
!
Oh
,
the
wretched
hours
*NL*
I
have
endured
--
the
torture
to
which
I
have
submitted
when
I
saw
the
*NL*
deadly
poison
poured
into
your
glass
,
and
how
I
trembled
lest
you
should
*NL*
drink
it
before
I
could
find
time
to
throw
it
away
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
,
''
said
Valentine
,
at
the
height
of
her
terror
,
``
you
say
you
endured
*NL*
tortures
when
you
saw
the
deadly
poison
poured
into
my
glass
;
but
if
you
*NL*
saw
this
,
you
must
also
have
seen
the
person
who
poured
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

''
Valentine
raised
herself
in
bed
,
and
drew
over
her
chest
,
which
*NL*
appeared
whiter
than
snow
,
the
embroidered
cambric
,
still
moist
with
the
*NL*
cold
dews
of
delirium
,
to
which
were
now
added
those
of
terror
.
``
You
saw
*NL*
the
person
?

repeated
the
young
girl
.
``
Yes
,
''
repeated
the
count
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
you
tell
me
is
horrible

You
wish

something

dreadful

?

attempt
to
murder
me
in
my
father
's

house

in
my
room

on
my
bed
of
sickness

leave
me

tempting

doubt
the
goodness

impossible

*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you

also
have
fallen
a

not
the
treatment
he
has

been
pursuing
for

three
years
neutralized
the
effects

the

poison
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
heaven
,
''
said
Valentine
;
``
is
this
the
reason
why
grandpapa
has
made
*NL*
me
share
all
his
beverages
during
the
last
month
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
have
they
all
tasted

a
slightly
bitter

dried
orange-peel

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes

yes

*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
that
explains
all

said
Monte
Cristo

``
Your
grandfather
knows
,
*NL*
then
,
that
a
poisoner
lives
here

perhaps
he
even
suspects
the

*NL*
He
has
been
fortifying
you
,
his
beloved
child
,
against
the
fatal
*NL*
effects
of
the
poison
,
which
has
failed
because
your
system
was
already
*NL*
impregnated
with
it
.
But
even
this
would
have
availed
little
against
a
*NL*
more
deadly
medium
of
death
employed
four
days

is
generally
*NL*

too
fatal

*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

yes

I
have
frequently

close

approach

*NL*

disappear
;
but
I
took
them
for
visions
raised
by
my
feverish
*NL*
imagination
,
and
indeed
when
you
entered
I
thought
I
was
under
the
*NL*
influence
of
delirium
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
do
not
know
who
it
is
that
attempts
your
life

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

''
said
Valentine
;
``
who
could
desire
my
death
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
shall
know
it
now

then
,

said
Monte

,
listening
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
mean
?
''
said
Valentine
,
looking
anxiously
around
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
you
are
not
feverish
or
delirious
to-night

thoroughly
*NL*
awake
;
midnight
is
striking
,
which
is
the
hour
murderers
choose

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
heavens
,
''
exclaimed
Valentine
,
wiping
off
the
drops
which
ran
down
*NL*
her
forehead
.
Midnight
struck
slowly
and
sadly
;
every
hour
seemed
to
*NL*
strike
with
leaden
weight
upon
the
heart
of
the
poor
girl
.
``
Valentine
,
''
*NL*
said
the
count
,
``
summon
up
all
your
courage
;
still
the
beatings
of
your
*NL*
heart
;
do
not
let
a
sound
escape
you
,
and
feign
to
be
asleep
;
then
you
*NL*
will
see
.
''
Valentine
seized
the
count
's
hand
.
``
I
think
I
hear
a
noise

*NL*
she
said
;
``
leave
me

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-by
,
for
the
present

replied
the
count
,
walking
upon
tiptoe
*NL*
towards
the
library
door
,
and
smiling
with
an
expression
so
sad
and
*NL*
paternal
that
the
young
girl
's
heart
was
filled
with
gratitude
.
*NL*
Before
closing
the
door
he
turned
around
once
more
,
and
said
,
``
Not
a
*NL*
movement

not
a
word

let
them
think
you
asleep

perhaps
you
may
be

killed
before
I
have
the
power
of
helping
you
.

And
with
this
fearful
*NL*
injunction
the
count
disappeared
through
the
door

noiselessly
*NL*
closed
after
him

Chapter

Locusta
.
*NL*
*NL*
Valentine
was
alone
;
two
other
clocks
,
slower
than
that
of
*NL*
Saint-Philippe
du
Roule
,
struck
the
hour
of
midnight
from
different
*NL*
directions
,
and
excepting
the
rumbling
of
a
few
carriages
all
was
*NL*
silent
.
Then
Valentine
's
attention
was
engrossed
by
the
clock
in
her
*NL*
room
,
which
marked
the
seconds
.
She
began
counting
them
,
remarking
that
*NL*
they
were
much
slower
than
the
beatings
of
her
heart
;
and
still
she
*NL*
doubted
,
--
the
inoffensive
Valentine
could
not
imagine
that
any
one
*NL*
should
desire
her
death
.
Why
should
they
?
To
what
end
?
What
had
she
*NL*
done
to
excite
the
malice
of
an
enemy
?
There
was
no
fear
of
her
falling
*NL*
asleep
.
One
terrible
idea
pressed
upon
her
mind
,
--
that
some
one
existed
*NL*
in
the
world
who
had
attempted
to
assassinate
her
,
and
who
was
about
*NL*
to
endeavor
to
do
so
again
.
Supposing
this
person
,
wearied
at
the
*NL*
inefficacy
of
the
poison
,
should
,
as
Monte
Cristo
intimated
,
have
*NL*
recourse
to
steel
!
--
What
if
the
count
should
have
no
time
to
run
to
her
*NL*
rescue
!
--
What
if
her
last
moments
were
approaching
,
and
she
should
never
*NL*
again
see
Morrel
!
When
this
terrible
chain
of
ideas
presented
itself
,
*NL*
Valentine
was
nearly
persuaded
to
ring
the
bell
,
and
call
for
help
.
But
*NL*
through
the
door
she
fancied
she
saw
the
luminous
eye
of
the
count
--
that
*NL*
eye
which
lived
in
her
memory
,
and
the
recollection
overwhelmed
her
with
*NL*
so
much
shame
that
she
asked
herself
whether
any
amount
of
gratitude
*NL*
could
ever
repay
his
adventurous
and
devoted
friendship
.
*NL*
*NL*
Twenty
minutes
,
twenty
tedious
minutes
,
passed
thus
,
then
ten
more
,
*NL*
and
at
last
the
clock
struck
the
half-hour
.
Just
then
the
sound
of
*NL*
finger-nails
slightly
grating
against
the
door
of
the
library
informed
*NL*
Valentine
that
the
count
was
still
watching
,
and
recommended
her
to
*NL*
do
the
same
;
at
the
same
time
,
on
the
opposite
side
,
that
is
towards
*NL*
Edward
's
room
,
Valentine
fancied
that
she
heard
the
creaking
of
the
*NL*
floor
;
she
listened
attentively
,
holding
her
breath
till
she
was
nearly
*NL*
suffocated
;
the
lock
turned
,
and
the
door
slowly
opened
.
Valentine
had
*NL*
raised
herself
upon
her
elbow
,
and
had
scarcely
time
to
throw
herself
*NL*
down
on
the
bed
and
shade
her
eyes
with
her
arm
;
then
,
trembling
,
*NL*
agitated
,
and
her
heart
beating
with
indescribable
terror
,
she
awaited
*NL*
the
event
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
one
approached
the
bed
and
drew
back
the
curtains
.
Valentine
*NL*
summoned
every
effort
,
and
breathed
with
that
regular
respiration
which
*NL*
announces
tranquil
sleep
.
``
Valentine
!
''
said
a
low
voice
.
Still
silent
:
*NL*
Valentine
had
promised
not
to
awake
.
Then
everything
was
still
,
*NL*
excepting
that
Valentine
heard
the
almost
noiseless
sound
of
some
liquid
*NL*
being
poured
into
the
glass
she
had
just
emptied
.
Then
she
ventured
to
*NL*
open
her
eyelids
,
and
glance
over
her
extended
arm
.
She
saw
a
woman
in
a
*NL*
white
dressing-gown
pouring
a
liquor
from
a
phial
into
her
glass
.
During
*NL*
this
short
time
Valentine
must
have
held
her
breath
,
or
moved
in
some
*NL*
slight
degree
,
for
the
woman
,
disturbed
,
stopped
and
leaned
over
the
*NL*
bed
,
in
order
the
better
to
ascertain
whether
Valentine
slept
--
it
was
*NL*
Madame
de
Villefort
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
recognizing
her
step-mother
,
Valentine
could
not
repress
a
shudder
,
*NL*
which
caused
a
vibration
in
the
bed
.
Madame
de
Villefort
instantly
*NL*
stepped
back
close
to
the
wall
,
and
there
,
shaded
by
the
bed-curtains
,
*NL*
she
silently
and
attentively
watched
the
slightest
movement
of
*NL*
Valentine
.
The
latter
recollected
the
terrible
caution
of
Monte
Cristo
;
*NL*
she
fancied
that
the
hand
not
holding
the
phial
clasped
a
long
sharp
*NL*
knife
.
Then
collecting
all
her
remaining
strength
,
she
forced
herself
to
*NL*
close
her
eyes
;
but
this
simple
operation
upon
the
most
delicate
organs
*NL*
of
our
frame
,
generally
so
easy
to
accomplish
,
became
almost
impossible
*NL*
at
this
moment
,
so
much
did
curiosity
struggle
to
retain
the
eyelid
*NL*
open
and
learn
the
truth
.
Madame
de
Villefort
,
however
,
reassured
by
*NL*
the
silence
,
which
was
alone
disturbed
by
the
regular
breathing
of
*NL*
Valentine
,
again
extended
her
hand
,
and
half
hidden
by
the
curtains
*NL*
succeeded
in
emptying
the
contents
of
the
phial
into
the
glass
.
Then
she
*NL*
retired
so
gently
that
Valentine
did
not
know
she
had
left
the
room
.
She
*NL*
only
witnessed
the
withdrawal
of
the
arm
--
the
fair
round
arm
of
a
woman
*NL*
but
twenty-five
years
old
,
and
who
yet
spread
death
around
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
impossible
to
describe
the
sensations
experienced
by
Valentine
*NL*
during
the
minute
and
a
half
Madame
de
Villefort
remained
in
the
room
.
*NL*
The
grating
against
the
library-door
aroused
the
young
girl
from
*NL*
the
stupor
in
which
she
was
plunged
,
and
which
almost
amounted
to
*NL*
insensibility
.
She
raised
her
head
with
an
effort
.
The
noiseless
door
*NL*
again
turned
on
its
hinges
,
and
the
Count
of
Monte
Cristo
reappeared
.
*NL*
``
Well

''
said
he
,
``
do
you
still
doubt
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

murmured
the
young
girl
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
seen
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas
!

*NL*
*NL*

Did
you
recognize
?

Valentine
groaned
.
``
Oh
,
yes
;

she
said
,
``
I
saw
,
but
*NL*
I
can
not
believe
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
you
rather
die
,
then
,
and
cause
Maximilian
's
death
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
repeated
the
young
girl
,
almost
bewildered
,
``
can
I
not
leave
the
*NL*
house
?
--
can
I
not
escape
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Valentine
,
the
hand
which
now
threatens
you
will
pursue
you
everywhere
;

your
servants
will
be
seduced
with
gold
,
and
death
will
be
offered
to
*NL*
you
disguised
in
every
shape

You
will
find
it
in
the
water

the
fruit

pluck
from

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
did
you
not

precaution

neutralized
the
poison

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

not
against

dose

be
changed

He
took
the
glass
and
raised
it
to
his
lips
.
``
It
*NL*
is
already
done

he
said
;

can
recognize
the

Valentine
in
the
extremity
of
her
terror
joined
her
hands
,

for
*NL*
she
felt
that
the
moment
had
arrived
to
ask
for
courage

and
began
to
*NL*
pray
,
and
while
uttering
little
more
than
incoherent
words
,
she
forgot
*NL*
that
her
white
shoulders
had
no
other
covering
than
her
long
hair
,
and
*NL*
that
the
pulsations
of
her
heart
could
be
seen
through
the
lace
of
her
*NL*
nightdress
.
Monte
Cristo
gently
laid
his
hand
on
the
young
girl
's
arm
,
*NL*
drew
the
velvet
coverlet
close
to
her
throat
,
and
said
with
a
paternal
*NL*
smile
,
--
``
My
child
,
believe
in
my
devotion
to
you
as
you
believe
in
the
*NL*
goodness
of
providence
and
the
love
of
Maximilian
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
drew
from
his
waistcoat-pocket
the
little
emerald
box
,
raised
*NL*
the
golden
lid
,
and
took
from
it
a
pastille
about
the
size
of
a
pea
,
*NL*
which
he
placed
in
her
hand
.
She
took
it
,
and
looked
attentively
on
the
*NL*
count
;
there
was
an
expression
on
the
face
of
her
intrepid
protector
*NL*
which
commanded
her
veneration
.
She
evidently
interrogated
him
by
her
*NL*
look
.
``
Yes
,
''
said
he
.
Valentine
carried
the
pastille
to
her
mouth
,
and
*NL*
swallowed
it
.
``
And
now
,
my
dear
child
,
adieu
for
the
present

I
will
try
*NL*
and
gain
a
little
sleep
,
for
you
are
saved

*NL*
*NL*
``
Go

said
Valentine
,
``
whatever
happens

I
promise
you
not
to
fear

*NL*
*NL*
Monte
Cristo
for
some
time
kept
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
young
girl
,
who
*NL*
gradually
fell
asleep
,
yielding
to
the
effects
of
the
narcotic
the
*NL*
count
had
given
her
.
Then
he
took
the
glass
,
emptied
three
parts
of
the
*NL*
contents
in
the
fireplace
,
that
it
might
be
supposed
Valentine
had
taken
*NL*
it
,
and
replaced
it
on
the
table
;
then
he
disappeared
,
after
throwing
*NL*
a
farewell
glance
on
Valentine
,
who
slept
with
the
confidence
and
*NL*
innocence
of
an
angel
.

Valentine

*NL*
*NL*
The
night-light
continued
to
burn
on
the
chimney-piece
,
exhausting
the
*NL*
last
drops
of
oil
which
floated
on
the
surface
of
the
water
.
The
globe
*NL*
of
the
lamp
appeared
of
a
reddish
hue
,
and
the
flame
,
brightening
before
*NL*
it
expired
,
threw
out
the
last
flickerings
which
in
an
inanimate
object
*NL*
have
been
so
often
compared
with
the
convulsions
of
a
human
creature
in
*NL*
its
final
agonies
.
A
dull
and
dismal
light
was
shed
over
the
bedclothes
*NL*
and
curtains
surrounding
the
young
girl
.
All
noise
in
the
streets
had
*NL*
ceased
,
and
the
silence
was
frightful
.
It
was
then
that
the
door
of
*NL*
Edward
's
room
opened
,
and
a
head
we
have
before
noticed
appeared
in
*NL*
the
glass
opposite
;
it
was
Madame
de
Villefort
,
who
came
to
witness
*NL*
the
effects
of
the
drink
she
had
prepared
.
She
stopped
in
the
doorway
,
*NL*
listened
for
a
moment
to
the
flickering
of
the
lamp
,
the
only
sound
in
*NL*
that
deserted
room
,
and
then
advanced
to
the
table
to
see
if
Valentine
's
*NL*
glass
were
empty
.
It
was
still
about
a
quarter
full
,
as
we
before
*NL*
stated
.
Madame
de
Villefort
emptied
the
contents
into
the
ashes
,
which
*NL*
she
disturbed
that
they
might
the
more
readily
absorb
the
liquid
;
then
*NL*
she
carefully
rinsed
the
glass
,
and
wiping
it
with
her
handkerchief
*NL*
replaced
it
on
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
any
one
could
have
looked
into
the
room
just
then
he
would
have
*NL*
noticed
the
hesitation
with
which
Madame
de
Villefort
approached
the
bed
*NL*
and
looked
fixedly
on
Valentine
.
The
dim
light
,
the
profound
silence
,
*NL*
and
the
gloomy
thoughts
inspired
by
the
hour
,
and
still
more
by
her
own
*NL*
conscience
,
all
combined
to
produce
a
sensation
of
fear
;
the
poisoner
*NL*
was
terrified
at
the
contemplation
of
her
own
work
.
At
length
she
*NL*
rallied
,
drew
aside
the
curtain
,
and
leaning
over
the
pillow
gazed
*NL*
intently
on
Valentine
.
The
young
girl
no
longer
breathed
,
no
breath
*NL*
issued
through
the
half-closed
teeth
;
the
white
lips
no
longer
*NL*
quivered
--
the
eyes
were
suffused
with
a
bluish
vapor
,
and
the
long
black
*NL*
lashes
rested
on
a
cheek
white
as
wax
.
Madame
de
Villefort
gazed
upon
*NL*
the
face
so
expressive
even
in
its
stillness
;
then
she
ventured
to
raise
*NL*
the
coverlet
and
press
her
hand
upon
the
young
girl
's
heart
.
It
was
*NL*
cold
and
motionless
.
She
only
felt
the
pulsation
in
her
own
fingers
,
and
*NL*
withdrew
her
hand
with
a
shudder
.
One
arm
was
hanging
out
of
the
bed
;
*NL*
from
shoulder
to
elbow
it
was
moulded
after
the
arms
of
Germain
*NL*
Pillon
's
``
Graces
,
''
-LSB-
*
-RSB-
but
the
fore-arm
seemed
to
be
slightly
distorted
*NL*
by
convulsion
,
and
the
hand
,
so
delicately
formed
,
was
resting
with
*NL*
stiff
outstretched
fingers
on
the
framework
of
the
bed
.
The
nails
,
too
,
*NL*
were
turning
blue
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
Germain
Pillon
was
a
famous
French
sculptor
-LRB-
1535-1598
-RRB-
.
*NL*
His
best
known
work
is
``
The
Three
Graces
,
''
now
in
the
*NL*
Louvre
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Villefort
had
no
longer
any
doubt
;
all
was
over
--
she
had
*NL*
consummated
the
last
terrible
work
she
had
to
accomplish
.
There
was
no
*NL*
more
to
do
in
the
room
,
so
the
poisoner
retired
stealthily
,
as
though
*NL*
fearing
to
hear
the
sound
of
her
own
footsteps
;
but
as
she
withdrew
she
*NL*
still
held
aside
the
curtain
,
absorbed
in
the
irresistible
attraction
*NL*
always
exerted
by
the
picture
of
death
,
so
long
as
it
is
merely
*NL*
mysterious
and
does
not
excite
disgust
.
Just
then
the
lamp
again
*NL*
flickered
;
the
noise
startled
Madame
de
Villefort
,
who
shuddered
and
*NL*
dropped
the
curtain
.
Immediately
afterwards
the
light
expired
,
and
the
*NL*
room
was
plunged
in
frightful
obscurity
,
while
the
clock
at
that
*NL*
minute
struck
half-past
four
.
Overpowered
with
agitation
,
the
poisoner
*NL*
succeeded
in
groping
her
way
to
the
door
,
and
reached
her
room
in
an
*NL*
agony
of
fear
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
darkness
lasted
two
hours
longer
;
then
by
degrees
a
cold
light
crept
*NL*
through
the
Venetian
blinds
,
until
at
length
it
revealed
the
objects
in
*NL*
the
room
.
About
this
time
the
nurse
's
cough
was
heard
on
the
stairs
and
*NL*
the
woman
entered
the
room
with
a
cup
in
her
hand
.
To
the
tender
eye
*NL*
of
a
father
or
a
lover
,
the
first
glance
would
have
sufficed
to
reveal
*NL*
Valentine
's
condition
;
but
to
this
hireling
,
Valentine
only
appeared
to
*NL*
sleep
.
``
Good
,
''
she
exclaimed
,
approaching
the
table
,
``
she
has
taken
part
*NL*
of
her
draught
;
the
glass
is
three-quarters
empty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
went
to
the
fireplace
and
lit
the
fire
,
and
although
she
*NL*
had
just
left
her
bed
,
she
could
not
resist
the
temptation
offered
by
*NL*
Valentine
's
sleep
,
so
she
threw
herself
into
an
arm-chair
to
snatch
a
*NL*
little
more
rest
.
The
clock
striking
eight
awoke
her
.
Astonished
at
the
*NL*
prolonged
slumber
of
the
patient
,
and
frightened
to
see
that
the
arm
was
*NL*
still
hanging
out
of
the
bed
,
she
advanced
towards
Valentine
,
and
for
*NL*
the
first
time
noticed
the
white
lips
.
She
tried
to
replace
the
arm
,
but
*NL*
it
moved
with
a
frightful
rigidity
which
could
not
deceive
a
sick-nurse
.
*NL*
She
screamed
aloud
;
then
running
to
the
door
exclaimed
,
--
``
Help
,
help
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
matter
?
''
asked
M.
d'Avrigny
,
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
,
it
*NL*
being
the
hour
he
usually
visited
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
asked
Villefort
,
rushing
from
his
room
.
``
Doctor
,
do
you
*NL*
hear
them
call
for
help
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
;
let
us
hasten
up
;
it
was
in
Valentine
's
room
.
''
But
before
the
*NL*
doctor
and
the
father
could
reach
the
room
,
the
servants
who
were
on
the
*NL*
same
floor
had
entered
,
and
seeing
Valentine
pale
and
motionless
on
her
*NL*
bed
,
they
lifted
up
their
hands
towards
heaven
and
stood
transfixed
,
as
*NL*
though
struck
by
lightening
.
``
Call
Madame
de
Villefort
!
--
Wake
Madame
*NL*
de
Villefort
!
''
cried
the
procureur
from
the
door
of
his
chamber
,
which
*NL*
apparently
he
scarcely
dared
to
leave
.
But
instead
of
obeying
him
,
the
*NL*
servants
stood
watching
M.
d'Avrigny
,
who
ran
to
Valentine
,
and
raised
*NL*
her
in
his
arms
.
``
What
?
--
this
one
,
too
?
''
he
exclaimed
.
``
Oh
,
where
will
*NL*
be
the
end
?
''
Villefort
rushed
into
the
room
.
``
What
are
you
saying
,
*NL*
doctor
?
''
he
exclaimed
,
raising
his
hands
to
heaven
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
that
Valentine
is
dead
!
''
replied
d'Avrigny
,
in
a
voice
terrible
*NL*
in
its
solemn
calm
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
de
Villefort
staggered
and
buried
his
head
in
the
bed
.
On
the
*NL*
exclamation
of
the
doctor
and
the
cry
of
the
father
,
the
servants
all
*NL*
fled
with
muttered
imprecations
;
they
were
heard
running
down
the
stairs
*NL*
and
through
the
long
passages
,
then
there
was
a
rush
in
the
court
,
*NL*
afterwards
all
was
still
;
they
had
,
one
and
all
,
deserted
the
accursed
*NL*
house
.
Just
then
,
Madame
de
Villefort
,
in
the
act
of
slipping
on
*NL*
her
dressing-gown
,
threw
aside
the
drapery
and
for
a
moment
stood
*NL*
motionless
,
as
though
interrogating
the
occupants
of
the
room
,
while
she
*NL*
endeavored
to
call
up
some
rebellious
tears
.
On
a
sudden
she
stepped
,
*NL*
or
rather
bounded
,
with
outstretched
arms
,
towards
the
table
.
She
saw
*NL*
d'Avrigny
curiously
examining
the
glass
,
which
she
felt
certain
of
*NL*
having
emptied
during
the
night
.
It
was
now
a
third
full
,
just
as
it
*NL*
was
when
she
threw
the
contents
into
the
ashes
.
The
spectre
of
Valentine
*NL*
rising
before
the
poisoner
would
have
alarmed
her
less
.
It
was
,
indeed
,
*NL*
the
same
color
as
the
draught
she
had
poured
into
the
glass
,
and
which
*NL*
Valentine
had
drunk
-RCB-
;
it
was
indeed
the
poison
,
which
could
not
deceive
*NL*
M.
d'Avrigny
,
which
he
now
examined
so
closely
;
it
was
doubtless
a
*NL*
miracle
from
heaven
,
that
,
notwithstanding
her
precautions
,
there
should
*NL*
be
some
trace
,
some
proof
remaining
to
reveal
the
crime
.
While
Madame
*NL*
de
Villefort
remained
rooted
to
the
spot
like
a
statue
of
terror
,
and
*NL*
Villefort
,
with
his
head
hidden
in
the
bedclothes
,
saw
nothing
around
*NL*
him
,
d'Avrigny
approached
the
window
,
that
he
might
the
better
examine
*NL*
the
contents
of
the
glass
,
and
dipping
the
tip
of
his
finger
in
,
tasted
*NL*
it
.
``
Ah
,
''
he
exclaimed
,
``
it
is
no
longer
brucine
that
is
used
;
let
me
*NL*
see
what
it
is
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
ran
to
one
of
the
cupboards
in
Valentine
's
room
,
which
had
been
*NL*
transformed
into
a
medicine
closet
,
and
taking
from
its
silver
case
a
*NL*
small
bottle
of
nitric
acid
,
dropped
a
little
of
it
into
the
liquor
,
*NL*
which
immediately
changed
to
a
blood-red
color
.
``
Ah
,
''
exclaimed
*NL*
d'Avrigny
,
in
a
voice
in
which
the
horror
of
a
judge
unveiling
the
truth
*NL*
was
mingled
with
the
delight
of
a
student
making
a
discovery
.
Madame
*NL*
de
Villefort
was
overpowered
,
her
eyes
first
flashed
and
then
swam
,
*NL*
she
staggered
towards
the
door
and
disappeared
.
Directly
afterwards
the
*NL*
distant
sound
of
a
heavy
weight
falling
on
the
ground
was
heard
,
but
*NL*
no
one
paid
any
attention
to
it
;
the
nurse
was
engaged
in
watching
*NL*
the
chemical
analysis
,
and
Villefort
was
still
absorbed
in
grief
.
M.
*NL*
d'Avrigny
alone
had
followed
Madame
de
Villefort
with
his
eyes
,
and
*NL*
watched
her
hurried
retreat
.
He
lifted
up
the
drapery
over
the
entrance
*NL*
to
Edward
's
room
,
and
his
eye
reaching
as
far
as
Madame
de
Villefort
's
*NL*
apartment
,
he
beheld
her
extended
lifeless
on
the
floor
.
``
Go
to
the
*NL*
assistance
of
Madame
de
Villefort
,
''
he
said
to
the
nurse
.
``
Madame
de
*NL*
Villefort
is
ill
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
Mademoiselle
de
Villefort
''
--
stammered
the
nurse
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mademoiselle
de
Villefort
no
longer
requires
help
,
''
said
d'Avrigny
,
*NL*
``
since
she
is
dead
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dead
,
--
dead
!
''
groaned
forth
Villefort
,
in
a
paroxysm
of
grief
,
which
*NL*
was
the
more
terrible
from
the
novelty
of
the
sensation
in
the
iron
*NL*
heart
of
that
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dead
!
''
repeated
a
third
voice
.
``
Who
said
Valentine
was
dead
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
men
turned
round
,
and
saw
Morrel
standing
at
the
door
,
pale
and
*NL*
terror-stricken
.
This
is
what
had
happened
.
At
the
usual
time
,
Morrel
*NL*
had
presented
himself
at
the
little
door
leading
to
Noirtier
's
room
.
*NL*
Contrary
to
custom
,
the
door
was
open
,
and
having
no
occasion
to
ring
he
*NL*
entered
.
He
waited
for
a
moment
in
the
hall
and
called
for
a
servant
to
*NL*
conduct
him
to
M.
Noirtier
;
but
no
one
answered
,
the
servants
having
,
*NL*
as
we
know
,
deserted
the
house
.
Morrel
had
no
particular
reason
for
*NL*
uneasiness
;
Monte
Cristo
had
promised
him
that
Valentine
should
live
,
*NL*
and
so
far
he
had
always
fulfilled
his
word
.
Every
night
the
count
had
*NL*
given
him
news
,
which
was
the
next
morning
confirmed
by
Noirtier
.
Still
*NL*
this
extraordinary
silence
appeared
strange
to
him
,
and
he
called
a
*NL*
second
and
third
time
;
still
no
answer
.
Then
he
determined
to
go
up
.
*NL*
Noirtier
's
room
was
opened
,
like
all
the
rest
.
The
first
thing
he
saw
*NL*
was
the
old
man
sitting
in
his
arm-chair
in
his
usual
place
,
but
his
*NL*
eyes
expressed
alarm
,
which
was
confirmed
by
the
pallor
which
overspread
*NL*
his
features
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
are
you
,
sir
?
''
asked
Morrel
,
with
a
sickness
of
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
answered
the
old
man
,
by
closing
his
eyes
;
but
his
appearance
*NL*
manifested
increasing
uneasiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
thoughtful
,
sir
,
''
continued
Morrel
;
``
you
want
something
;
shall
*NL*
I
call
one
of
the
servants
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
replied
Noirtier
.
*NL*
*NL*
Morrel
pulled
the
bell
,
but
though
he
nearly
broke
the
cord
no
one
*NL*
answered
.
He
turned
towards
Noirtier
;
the
pallor
and
anguish
expressed
*NL*
on
his
countenance
momentarily
increased
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
exclaimed
Morrel
,
``
why
do
they
not
come
?
Is
any
one
ill
in
the
*NL*
house
?
''
The
eyes
of
Noirtier
seemed
as
though
they
would
start
from
*NL*
their
sockets
.
``
What
is
the
matter
?
You
alarm
me
.
Valentine
?
Valentine
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
''
signed
Noirtier
.
Maximilian
tried
to
speak
,
but
he
could
*NL*
articulate
nothing
;
he
staggered
,
and
supported
himself
against
the
*NL*
wainscot
.
Then
he
pointed
to
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
yes
!
''
continued
the
old
man
.
Maximilian
rushed
up
the
little
*NL*
staircase
,
while
Noirtier
's
eyes
seemed
to
say
,
--
``
Quicker
,
quicker
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
minute
the
young
man
darted
through
several
rooms
,
till
at
length
*NL*
he
reached
Valentine
's
.
There
was
no
occasion
to
push
the
door
,
it
was
*NL*
wide
open
.
A
sob
was
the
only
sound
he
heard
.
He
saw
as
though
in
a
*NL*
mist
,
a
black
figure
kneeling
and
buried
in
a
confused
mass
of
white
*NL*
drapery
.
A
terrible
fear
transfixed
him
.
It
was
then
he
heard
a
voice
*NL*
exclaim
``
Valentine
is
dead
!
''
and
another
voice
which
,
like
an
echo
*NL*
repeated
,
--
``
Dead
,
--
dead
!
''

Chapter
103
.
Maximilian
.
*NL*
*NL*
Villefort
rose
,
half
ashamed
of
being
surprised
in
such
a
paroxysm
*NL*
of
grief
.
The
terrible
office
he
had
held
for
twenty-five
years
had
*NL*
succeeded
in
making
him
more
or
less
than
man
.
His
glance
,
at
first
*NL*
wandering
,
fixed
itself
upon
Morrel
.
``
Who
are
you
,
sir
,
''
he
asked
,
``
that
*NL*
forget
that
this
is
not
the
manner
to
enter
a
house
stricken
with
death
?
*NL*
Go
,
sir
,
go
!
''
But
Morrel
remained
motionless
;
he
could
not
detach
his
*NL*
eyes
from
that
disordered
bed
,
and
the
pale
corpse
of
the
young
girl
*NL*
who
was
lying
on
it
.
``
Go
!
--
do
you
hear
?
''
said
Villefort
,
while
d'Avrigny
*NL*
advanced
to
lead
Morrel
out
.
Maximilian
stared
for
a
moment
at
the
*NL*
corpse
,
gazed
all
around
the
room
,
then
upon
the
two
men
;
he
opened
*NL*
his
mouth
to
speak
,
but
finding
it
impossible
to
give
utterance
to
the
*NL*
innumerable
ideas
that
occupied
his
brain
,
he
went
out
,
thrusting
his
*NL*
hands
through
his
hair
in
such
a
manner
that
Villefort
and
d'Avrigny
,
*NL*
for
a
moment
diverted
from
the
engrossing
topic
,
exchanged
glances
,
*NL*
which
seemed
to
say
,
--
``
He
is
mad
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
in
less
than
five
minutes
the
staircase
groaned
beneath
an
*NL*
extraordinary
weight
.
Morrel
was
seen
carrying
,
with
superhuman
*NL*
strength
,
the
arm-chair
containing
Noirtier
up-stairs
.
When
he
reached
*NL*
the
landing
he
placed
the
arm-chair
on
the
floor
and
rapidly
rolled
it
*NL*
into
Valentine
's
room
.
This
could
only
have
been
accomplished
by
means
*NL*
of
unnatural
strength
supplied
by
powerful
excitement
.
But
the
most
*NL*
fearful
spectacle
was
Noirtier
being
pushed
towards
the
bed
,
his
face
*NL*
expressing
all
his
meaning
,
and
his
eyes
supplying
the
want
of
every
*NL*
other
faculty
.
That
pale
face
and
flaming
glance
appeared
to
Villefort
*NL*
like
a
frightful
apparition
.
Each
time
he
had
been
brought
into
contact
*NL*
with
his
father
,
something
terrible
had
happened
.
``
See
what
they
have
*NL*
done
!
''
cried
Morrel
,
with
one
hand
leaning
on
the
back
of
the
chair
,
and
*NL*
the
other
extended
towards
Valentine
.
``
See
,
my
father
,
see
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Villefort
drew
back
and
looked
with
astonishment
on
the
young
man
,
who
,
*NL*
almost
a
stranger
to
him
,
called
Noirtier
his
father
.
At
this
moment
*NL*
the
whole
soul
of
the
old
man
seemed
centred
in
his
eyes
which
became
*NL*
bloodshot
;
the
veins
of
the
throat
swelled
;
his
cheeks
and
temples
*NL*
became
purple
,
as
though
he
was
struck
with
epilepsy
;
nothing
was
*NL*
wanting
to
complete
this
but
the
utterance
of
a
cry
.
And
the
cry
issued
*NL*
from
his
pores
,
if
we
may
thus
speak
--
a
cry
frightful
in
its
silence
.
*NL*
D'Avrigny
rushed
towards
the
old
man
and
made
him
inhale
a
powerful
*NL*
restorative
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
,
''
cried
Morrel
,
seizing
the
moist
hand
of
the
paralytic
,
``
they
ask
*NL*
me
who
I
am
,
and
what
right
I
have
to
be
here
.
Oh
,
you
know
it
,
tell
*NL*
them
,
tell
them
!
''
And
the
young
man
's
voice
was
choked
by
sobs
.
As
for
*NL*
the
old
man
,
his
chest
heaved
with
his
panting
respiration
.
One
could
*NL*
have
thought
that
he
was
undergoing
the
agonies
preceding
death
.
At
*NL*
length
,
happier
than
the
young
man
,
who
sobbed
without
weeping
,
tears
*NL*
glistened
in
the
eyes
of
Noirtier
.
``
Tell
them
,
''
said
Morrel
in
a
hoarse
*NL*
voice
,
``
tell
them
that
I
am
her
betrothed
.
Tell
them
she
was
my
beloved
,
*NL*
my
noble
girl
,
my
only
blessing
in
the
world
.
Tell
them
--
oh
,
tell
them
,
*NL*
that
corpse
belongs
to
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
overwhelmed
by
the
weight
of
his
anguish
,
fell
heavily
*NL*
on
his
knees
before
the
bed
,
which
his
fingers
grasped
with
convulsive
*NL*
energy
.
D'Avrigny
,
unable
to
bear
the
sight
of
this
touching
emotion
,
*NL*
turned
away
;
and
Villefort
,
without
seeking
any
further
explanation
,
*NL*
and
attracted
towards
him
by
the
irresistible
magnetism
which
draws
us
*NL*
towards
those
who
have
loved
the
people
for
whom
we
mourn
,
extended
his
*NL*
hand
towards
the
young
man
.
But
Morrel
saw
nothing
;
he
had
grasped
the
*NL*
hand
of
Valentine
,
and
unable
to
weep
vented
his
agony
in
groans
as
*NL*
he
bit
the
sheets
.
For
some
time
nothing
was
heard
in
that
chamber
but
*NL*
sobs
,
exclamations
,
and
prayers
.
At
length
Villefort
,
the
most
composed
*NL*
of
all
,
spoke
:
``
Sir
,
''
said
he
to
Maximilian
,
``
you
say
you
loved
*NL*
Valentine
,
that
you
were
betrothed
to
her
.
I
knew
nothing
of
this
*NL*
engagement
,
of
this
love
,
yet
I
,
her
father
,
forgive
you
,
for
I
see
that
*NL*
your
grief
is
real
and
deep
;
and
besides
my
own
sorrow
is
too
great
for
*NL*
anger
to
find
a
place
in
my
heart
.
But
you
see
that
the
angel
whom
*NL*
you
hoped
for
has
left
this
earth
--
she
has
nothing
more
to
do
with
the
*NL*
adoration
of
men
.
Take
a
last
farewell
,
sir
,
of
her
sad
remains
;
take
*NL*
the
hand
you
expected
to
possess
once
more
within
your
own
,
and
then
*NL*
separate
yourself
from
her
forever
.
Valentine
now
requires
only
the
*NL*
ministrations
of
the
priest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
mistaken
,
sir
,
''
exclaimed
Morrel
,
raising
himself
on
one
knee
,
*NL*
his
heart
pierced
by
a
more
acute
pang
than
any
he
had
yet
felt
--
``
you
*NL*
are
mistaken
;
Valentine
,
dying
as
she
has
,
not
only
requires
a
priest
,
*NL*
but
an
avenger
.
You
,
M.
de
Villefort
,
send
for
the
priest
;
I
will
be
the
*NL*
avenger
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
,
sir
?
''
asked
Villefort
,
trembling
at
the
new
idea
*NL*
inspired
by
the
delirium
of
Morrel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
tell
you
,
sir
,
that
two
persons
exist
in
you
;
the
father
has
mourned
*NL*
sufficiently
,
now
let
the
procureur
fulfil
his
office
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
eyes
of
Noirtier
glistened
,
and
d'Avrigny
approached
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gentlemen
,
''
said
Morrel
,
reading
all
that
passed
through
the
minds
of
*NL*
the
witnesses
to
the
scene
,
``
I
know
what
I
am
saying
,
and
you
know
as
*NL*
well
as
I
do
what
I
am
about
to
say
--
Valentine
has
been
assassinated
!
''
*NL*
Villefort
hung
his
head
,
d'Avrigny
approached
nearer
,
and
Noirtier
said
*NL*
``
Yes
''
with
his
eyes
.
``
Now
,
sir
,
''
continued
Morrel
,
``
in
these
days
no
one
*NL*
can
disappear
by
violent
means
without
some
inquiries
being
made
as
to
*NL*
the
cause
of
her
disappearance
,
even
were
she
not
a
young
,
beautiful
,
*NL*
and
adorable
creature
like
Valentine
.
Mr.
Procureur
,
''
said
Morrel
with
*NL*
increasing
vehemence
,
``
no
mercy
is
allowed
;
I
denounce
the
crime
;
it
*NL*
is
your
place
to
seek
the
assassin
.
''
The
young
man
's
implacable
eyes
*NL*
interrogated
Villefort
,
who
,
on
his
side
,
glanced
from
Noirtier
to
*NL*
d'Avrigny
.
But
instead
of
finding
sympathy
in
the
eyes
of
the
doctor
*NL*
and
his
father
,
he
only
saw
an
expression
as
inflexible
as
that
of
*NL*
Maximilian
.
``
Yes
,
''
indicated
the
old
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Assuredly
,
''
said
d'Avrigny
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
,
''
said
Villefort
,
striving
to
struggle
against
this
triple
force
*NL*
and
his
own
emotion
,
--
``
sir
,
you
are
deceived
;
no
one
commits
crimes
*NL*
here
.
I
am
stricken
by
fate
.
It
is
horrible
,
indeed
,
but
no
one
*NL*
assassinates
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
eyes
of
Noirtier
lighted
up
with
rage
,
and
d'Avrigny
prepared
to
*NL*
speak
.
Morrel
,
however
,
extended
his
arm
,
and
commanded
silence
.
``
And
I
*NL*
say
that
murders
are
committed
here
,
''
said
Morrel
,
whose
voice
,
though
*NL*
lower
in
tone
,
lost
none
of
its
terrible
distinctness
:
``
I
tell
you
*NL*
that
this
is
the
fourth
victim
within
the
last
four
months
.
I
tell
*NL*
you
,
Valentine
's
life
was
attempted
by
poison
four
days
ago
,
though
she
*NL*
escaped
,
owing
to
the
precautions
of
M.
Noirtier
.
I
tell
you
that
the
*NL*
dose
has
been
double
,
the
poison
changed
,
and
that
this
time
it
has
*NL*
succeeded
.
I
tell
you
that
you
know
these
things
as
well
as
I
do
,
since
*NL*
this
gentleman
has
forewarned
you
,
both
as
a
doctor
and
as
a
friend
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
rave
,
sir
,
''
exclaimed
Villefort
,
in
vain
endeavoring
to
escape
*NL*
the
net
in
which
he
was
taken
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
rave
?
''
said
Morrel
;
``
well
,
then
,
I
appeal
to
M.
d'Avrigny
himself
.
*NL*
Ask
him
,
sir
,
if
he
recollects
the
words
he
uttered
in
the
garden
of
*NL*
this
house
on
the
night
of
Madame
de
Saint-Meran
's
death
.
You
thought
*NL*
yourselves
alone
,
and
talked
about
that
tragical
death
,
and
the
*NL*
fatality
you
mentioned
then
is
the
same
which
has
caused
the
murder
*NL*
of
Valentine
.
''
Villefort
and
d'Avrigny
exchanged
looks
.
``
Yes
,
yes
,
''
*NL*
continued
Morrel
;
``
recall
the
scene
,
for
the
words
you
thought
were
*NL*
only
given
to
silence
and
solitude
fell
into
my
ears
.
Certainly
,
after
*NL*
witnessing
the
culpable
indolence
manifested
by
M.
de
Villefort
towards
*NL*
his
own
relations
,
I
ought
to
have
denounced
him
to
the
authorities
;
*NL*
then
I
should
not
have
been
an
accomplice
to
thy
death
,
as
I
now
am
,
*NL*
sweet
,
beloved
Valentine
;
but
the
accomplice
shall
become
the
avenger
.
*NL*
This
fourth
murder
is
apparent
to
all
,
and
if
thy
father
abandon
thee
,
*NL*
Valentine
,
it
is
I
,
and
I
swear
it
,
that
shall
pursue
the
assassin
.
''
*NL*
And
this
time
,
as
though
nature
had
at
least
taken
compassion
on
the
*NL*
vigorous
frame
,
nearly
bursting
with
its
own
strength
,
the
words
of
*NL*
Morrel
were
stifled
in
his
throat
;
his
breast
heaved
;
the
tears
,
so
long
*NL*
rebellious
,
gushed
from
his
eyes
;
and
he
threw
himself
weeping
on
his
*NL*
knees
by
the
side
of
the
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
d'Avrigny
spoke
.
``
And
I
,
too
,
''
he
exclaimed
in
a
low
voice
,
``
I
*NL*
unite
with
M.
Morrel
in
demanding
justice
for
crime
;
my
blood
boils
at
*NL*
the
idea
of
having
encouraged
a
murderer
by
my
cowardly
concession
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
merciful
heavens
!
''
murmured
Villefort
.
Morrel
raised
his
head
,
*NL*
and
reading
the
eyes
of
the
old
man
,
which
gleamed
with
unnatural
*NL*
lustre
,
--
``
Stay
,
''
he
said
,
``
M.
Noirtier
wishes
to
speak
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
indicated
Noirtier
,
with
an
expression
the
more
terrible
,
from
*NL*
all
his
faculties
being
centred
in
his
glance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
the
assassin
?
''
asked
Morrel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
replied
Noirtier
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
will
you
direct
us
?
''
exclaimed
the
young
man
.
``
Listen
,
M.
*NL*
d'Avrigny
,
listen
!
''
Noirtier
looked
upon
Morrel
with
one
of
those
*NL*
melancholy
smiles
which
had
so
often
made
Valentine
happy
,
and
thus
*NL*
fixed
his
attention
.
Then
,
having
riveted
the
eyes
of
his
interlocutor
*NL*
on
his
own
,
he
glanced
towards
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
wish
me
to
leave
?
''
said
Morrel
,
sadly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
replied
Noirtier
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas
,
alas
,
sir
,
have
pity
on
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
man
's
eyes
remained
fixed
on
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
I
,
at
least
,
return
?
''
asked
Morrel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Must
I
leave
alone
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whom
am
I
to
take
with
me
?
The
procureur
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
doctor
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
wish
to
remain
alone
with
M.
de
Villefort
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
can
he
understand
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
said
Villefort
,
inexpressibly
delighted
to
think
that
the
*NL*
inquiries
were
to
be
made
by
him
alone
,
--
``
oh
,
be
satisfied
,
I
can
*NL*
understand
my
father
.
''
D'Avrigny
took
the
young
man
's
arm
,
and
led
*NL*
him
out
of
the
room
.
A
more
than
deathlike
silence
then
reigned
in
*NL*
the
house
.
At
the
end
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
a
faltering
footstep
*NL*
was
heard
,
and
Villefort
appeared
at
the
door
of
the
apartment
where
*NL*
d'Avrigny
and
Morrel
had
been
staying
,
one
absorbed
in
meditation
,
the
*NL*
other
in
grief
.
``
You
can
come
,
''
he
said
,
and
led
them
back
to
Noirtier
.
*NL*
Morrel
looked
attentively
on
Villefort
.
His
face
was
livid
,
large
drops
*NL*
rolled
down
his
face
,
and
in
his
fingers
he
held
the
fragments
of
a
*NL*
quill
pen
which
he
had
torn
to
atoms
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gentlemen
,
''
he
said
in
a
hoarse
voice
,
``
give
me
your
word
of
honor
that
*NL*
this
horrible
secret
shall
forever
remain
buried
amongst
ourselves
!
''
The
*NL*
two
men
drew
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
entreat
you
.
''
--
continued
Villefort
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
''
said
Morrel
,
``
the
culprit
--
the
murderer
--
the
assassin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
not
alarm
yourself
,
sir
;
justice
will
be
done
,
''
said
Villefort
.
``
My
*NL*
father
has
revealed
the
culprit
's
name
;
my
father
thirsts
for
revenge
as
*NL*
much
as
you
do
,
yet
even
he
conjures
you
as
I
do
to
keep
this
secret
.
Do
*NL*
you
not
,
father
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
resolutely
replied
Noirtier
.
Morrel
suffered
an
exclamation
of
*NL*
horror
and
surprise
to
escape
him
.
``
Oh
,
sir
,
''
said
Villefort
,
arresting
*NL*
Maximilian
by
the
arm
,
``
if
my
father
,
the
inflexible
man
,
makes
this
*NL*
request
,
it
is
because
he
knows
,
be
assured
,
that
Valentine
will
be
*NL*
terribly
revenged
.
Is
it
not
so
,
father
?
''
The
old
man
made
a
sign
in
the
*NL*
affirmative
.
Villefort
continued
:
``
He
knows
me
,
and
I
have
pledged
my
*NL*
word
to
him
.
Rest
assured
,
gentlemen
,
that
within
three
days
,
in
a
less
*NL*
time
than
justice
would
demand
,
the
revenge
I
shall
have
taken
for
the
*NL*
murder
of
my
child
will
be
such
as
to
make
the
boldest
heart
tremble
;
''
*NL*
and
as
he
spoke
these
words
he
ground
his
teeth
,
and
grasped
the
old
*NL*
man
's
senseless
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
this
promise
be
fulfilled
,
M.
Noirtier
?
''
asked
Morrel
,
while
*NL*
d'Avrigny
looked
inquiringly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
replied
Noirtier
with
an
expression
of
sinister
joy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Swear
,
then
,
''
said
Villefort
,
joining
the
hands
of
Morrel
and
*NL*
d'Avrigny
,
``
swear
that
you
will
spare
the
honor
of
my
house
,
and
leave
*NL*
me
to
avenge
my
child
.
''
D'Avrigny
turned
round
and
uttered
a
very
feeble
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
but
Morrel
,
disengaging
his
hand
,
rushed
to
the
bed
,
and
after
*NL*
having
pressed
the
cold
lips
of
Valentine
with
his
own
,
hurriedly
left
,
*NL*
uttering
a
long
,
deep
groan
of
despair
and
anguish
.
We
have
before
*NL*
stated
that
all
the
servants
had
fled
.
M.
de
Villefort
was
therefore
*NL*
obliged
to
request
M.
d'Avrigny
to
superintend
all
the
arrangements
*NL*
consequent
upon
a
death
in
a
large
city
,
more
especially
a
death
under
*NL*
such
suspicious
circumstances
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
something
terrible
to
witness
the
silent
agony
,
the
mute
despair
*NL*
of
Noirtier
,
whose
tears
silently
rolled
down
his
cheeks
.
Villefort
*NL*
retired
to
his
study
,
and
d'Avrigny
left
to
summon
the
doctor
of
the
*NL*
mayoralty
,
whose
office
it
is
to
examine
bodies
after
decease
,
and
who
*NL*
is
expressly
named
``
the
doctor
of
the
dead
.
''
M.
Noirtier
could
not
be
*NL*
persuaded
to
quit
his
grandchild
.
At
the
end
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
M.
*NL*
d'Avrigny
returned
with
his
associate
;
they
found
the
outer
gate
closed
,
*NL*
and
not
a
servant
remaining
in
the
house
;
Villefort
himself
was
obliged
*NL*
to
open
to
them
.
But
he
stopped
on
the
landing
;
he
had
not
the
courage
*NL*
to
again
visit
the
death
chamber
.
The
two
doctors
,
therefore
,
entered
*NL*
the
room
alone
.
Noirtier
was
near
the
bed
,
pale
,
motionless
,
and
silent
*NL*
as
the
corpse
.
The
district
doctor
approached
with
the
indifference
of
*NL*
a
man
accustomed
to
spend
half
his
time
amongst
the
dead
;
he
then
lifted
*NL*
the
sheet
which
was
placed
over
the
face
,
and
just
unclosed
the
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas
,
''
said
d'Avrigny
,
``
she
is
indeed
dead
,
poor
child
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
answered
the
doctor
laconically
,
dropping
the
sheet
he
had
*NL*
raised
.
Noirtier
uttered
a
kind
of
hoarse
,
rattling
sound
;
the
old
man
's
*NL*
eyes
sparkled
,
and
the
good
doctor
understood
that
he
wished
to
behold
*NL*
his
child
.
He
therefore
approached
the
bed
,
and
while
his
companion
was
*NL*
dipping
the
fingers
with
which
he
had
touched
the
lips
of
the
corpse
in
*NL*
chloride
of
lime
,
he
uncovered
the
calm
and
pale
face
,
which
looked
like
*NL*
that
of
a
sleeping
angel
.
A
tear
,
which
appeared
in
the
old
man
's
eye
,
*NL*
expressed
his
thanks
to
the
doctor
.
The
doctor
of
the
dead
then
laid
his
*NL*
permit
on
the
corner
of
the
table
,
and
having
fulfilled
his
duty
,
was
*NL*
conducted
out
by
d'Avrigny
.
Villefort
met
them
at
the
door
of
his
*NL*
study
;
having
in
a
few
words
thanked
the
district
doctor
,
he
turned
to
*NL*
d'Avrigny
,
and
said
,
--
``
And
now
the
priest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
there
any
particular
priest
you
wish
to
pray
with
Valentine
?
''
asked
*NL*
d'Avrigny
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
said
Villefort
;
``
fetch
the
nearest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
nearest
,
''
said
the
district
doctor
,
``
is
a
good
Italian
abbe
,
who
*NL*
lives
next
door
to
you
.
Shall
I
call
on
him
as
I
pass
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
D'Avrigny
,
''
said
Villefort
,
``
be
so
kind
,
I
beseech
you
,
as
to
accompany
*NL*
this
gentleman
.
Here
is
the
key
of
the
door
,
so
that
you
can
go
in
and
*NL*
out
as
you
please
;
you
will
bring
the
priest
with
you
,
and
will
oblige
*NL*
me
by
introducing
him
into
my
child
's
room
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
wish
to
see
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
only
wish
to
be
alone
.
You
will
excuse
me
,
will
you
not
?
A
priest
*NL*
can
understand
a
father
's
grief
.
''
And
M.
de
Villefort
,
giving
the
key
to
*NL*
d'Avrigny
,
again
bade
farewell
to
the
strange
doctor
,
and
retired
to
his
*NL*
study
,
where
he
began
to
work
.
For
some
temperaments
work
is
a
remedy
*NL*
for
all
afflictions
.
As
the
doctors
entered
the
street
,
they
saw
a
man
*NL*
in
a
cassock
standing
on
the
threshold
of
the
next
door
.
``
This
is
the
*NL*
abbe
of
whom
I
spoke
,
''
said
the
doctor
to
d'Avrigny
.
D'Avrigny
accosted
*NL*
the
priest
.
``
Sir
,
''
he
said
,
``
are
you
disposed
to
confer
a
great
*NL*
obligation
on
an
unhappy
father
who
has
just
lost
his
daughter
?
I
mean
*NL*
M.
de
Villefort
,
the
king
's
attorney
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
said
the
priest
,
in
a
marked
Italian
accent
;
``
yes
,
I
have
heard
*NL*
that
death
is
in
that
house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
need
not
tell
you
what
kind
of
service
he
requires
of
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
about
to
offer
myself
,
sir
,
''
said
the
priest
;
``
it
is
our
mission
*NL*
to
forestall
our
duties
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
young
girl
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
it
,
sir
;
the
servants
who
fled
from
the
house
informed
me
.
I
*NL*
also
know
that
her
name
is
Valentine
,
and
I
have
already
prayed
for
*NL*
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
sir
,
''
said
d'Avrigny
;
``
since
you
have
commenced
your
sacred
*NL*
office
,
deign
to
continue
it
.
Come
and
watch
by
the
dead
,
and
all
the
*NL*
wretched
family
will
be
grateful
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
going
,
sir
;
and
I
do
not
hesitate
to
say
that
no
prayers
will
be
*NL*
more
fervent
than
mine
.
''
D'Avrigny
took
the
priest
's
hand
,
and
*NL*
without
meeting
Villefort
,
who
was
engaged
in
his
study
,
they
reached
*NL*
Valentine
's
room
,
which
on
the
following
night
was
to
be
occupied
by
*NL*
the
undertakers
.
On
entering
the
room
,
Noirtier
's
eyes
met
those
of
the
*NL*
abbe
,
and
no
doubt
he
read
some
particular
expression
in
them
,
for
he
*NL*
remained
in
the
room
.
D'Avrigny
recommended
the
attention
of
the
priest
*NL*
to
the
living
as
well
as
to
the
dead
,
and
the
abbe
promised
to
devote
*NL*
his
prayers
to
Valentine
and
his
attentions
to
Noirtier
.
In
order
,
*NL*
doubtless
,
that
he
might
not
be
disturbed
while
fulfilling
his
sacred
*NL*
mission
,
the
priest
rose
as
soon
as
d'Avrigny
departed
,
and
not
only
*NL*
bolted
the
door
through
which
the
doctor
had
just
left
,
but
also
that
*NL*
leading
to
Madame
de
Villefort
's

Danglars
Signature
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
morning
dawned
dull
and
cloudy
.
During
the
night
the
*NL*
undertakers
had
executed
their
melancholy
office
,
and
wrapped
the
corpse
*NL*
in
the
winding-sheet
,
which
,
whatever
may
be
said
about
the
equality
of
*NL*
death
,
is
at
least
a
last
proof
of
the
luxury
so
pleasing
in
life
.
This
*NL*
winding-sheet
was
nothing
more
than
a
beautiful
piece
of
cambric
,
which
*NL*
the
young
girl
had
bought
a
fortnight
before
.
During
the
evening
two
*NL*
men
,
engaged
for
the
purpose
,
had
carried
Noirtier
from
Valentine
's
room
*NL*
into
his
own
,
and
contrary
to
all
expectation
there
was
no
difficulty
*NL*
in
withdrawing
him
from
his
child
.
The
Abbe
Busoni
had
watched
till
*NL*
daylight
,
and
then
left
without
calling
any
one
.
D'Avrigny
returned
*NL*
about
eight
o'clock
in
the
morning
;
he
met
Villefort
on
his
way
to
*NL*
Noirtier
's
room
,
and
accompanied
him
to
see
how
the
old
man
had
slept
.
*NL*
They
found
him
in
the
large
arm-chair
,
which
served
him
for
a
bed
,
*NL*
enjoying
a
calm
,
nay
,
almost
a
smiling
sleep
.
They
both
stood
in
*NL*
amazement
at
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
See
,
''
said
d'Avrigny
to
Villefort
,
``
nature
knows
how
to
alleviate
the
*NL*
deepest
sorrow
.
No
one
can
say
that
M.
Noirtier
did
not
love
his
child
,
*NL*
and
yet
he
sleeps
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
you
are
right
,
''
replied
Villefort
,
surprised
;
``
he
sleeps
,
indeed
!
*NL*
And
this
is
the
more
strange
,
since
the
least
contradiction
keeps
him
*NL*
awake
all
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Grief
has
stunned
him
,
''
replied
d'Avrigny
;
and
they
both
returned
*NL*
thoughtfully
to
the
procureur
's
study
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
See
,
I
have
not
slept
,
''
said
Villefort
,
showing
his
undisturbed
bed
;
*NL*
``
grief
does
not
stun
me
.
I
have
not
been
in
bed
for
two
nights
;
but
*NL*
then
look
at
my
desk
;
see
what
I
have
written
during
these
two
days
and
*NL*
nights
.
I
have
filled
those
papers
,
and
have
made
out
the
accusation
*NL*
against
the
assassin
Benedetto
.
Oh
,
work
,
work
,
--
my
passion
,
my
joy
,
my
*NL*
delight
,
--
it
is
for
thee
to
alleviate
my
sorrows
!
''
and
he
convulsively
*NL*
grasped
the
hand
of
d'Avrigny
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
require
my
services
now
?
''
asked
d'Avrigny
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Villefort
;
``
only
return
again
at
eleven
o'clock
;
at
twelve
*NL*
the
--
the
--
oh
,
heavens
,
my
poor
,
poor
child
!
''
and
the
procureur
again
*NL*
becoming
a
man
,
lifted
up
his
eyes
and
groaned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
you
be
present
in
the
reception
room
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
I
have
a
cousin
who
has
undertaken
this
sad
office
.
I
shall
work
,
*NL*
doctor
--
when
I
work
I
forget
everything
.
''
And
,
indeed
,
no
sooner
had
*NL*
the
doctor
left
the
room
,
than
he
was
again
absorbed
in
study
.
On
the
*NL*
doorsteps
d'Avrigny
met
the
cousin
whom
Villefort
had
mentioned
,
a
*NL*
personage
as
insignificant
in
our
story
as
in
the
world
he
occupied
--
one
*NL*
of
those
beings
designed
from
their
birth
to
make
themselves
useful
to
*NL*
others
.
He
was
punctual
,
dressed
in
black
,
with
crape
around
his
hat
,
*NL*
and
presented
himself
at
his
cousin
's
with
a
face
made
up
for
the
*NL*
occasion
,
and
which
he
could
alter
as
might
be
required
.
At
twelve
*NL*
o'clock
the
mourning-coaches
rolled
into
the
paved
court
,
and
the
Rue
du
*NL*
Faubourg
Saint-Honore
was
filled
with
a
crowd
of
idlers
,
equally
pleased
*NL*
to
witness
the
festivities
or
the
mourning
of
the
rich
,
and
who
rush
*NL*
with
the
same
avidity
to
a
funeral
procession
as
to
the
marriage
of
a
*NL*
duchess
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gradually
the
reception-room
filled
,
and
some
of
our
old
friends
*NL*
made
their
appearance
--
we
mean
Debray
,
Chateau-Renaud
,
and
Beauchamp
,
*NL*
accompanied
by
all
the
leading
men
of
the
day
at
the
bar
,
in
literature
,
*NL*
or
the
army
,
for
M.
de
Villefort
moved
in
the
first
Parisian
circles
,
*NL*
less
owing
to
his
social
position
than
to
his
personal
merit
.
The
cousin
*NL*
standing
at
the
door
ushered
in
the
guests
,
and
it
was
rather
a
relief
*NL*
to
the
indifferent
to
see
a
person
as
unmoved
as
themselves
,
and
who
did
*NL*
not
exact
a
mournful
face
or
force
tears
,
as
would
have
been
the
case
*NL*
with
a
father
,
a
brother
,
or
a
lover
.
Those
who
were
acquainted
*NL*
soon
formed
into
little
groups
.
One
of
them
was
made
of
Debray
,
*NL*
Chateau-Renaud
,
and
Beauchamp
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
girl
,
''
said
Debray
,
like
the
rest
,
paying
an
involuntary
tribute
*NL*
to
the
sad
event
,
--
``
poor
girl
,
so
young
,
so
rich
,
so
beautiful
!
Could
*NL*
you
have
imagined
this
scene
,
Chateau-Renaud
,
when
we
saw
her
,
at
the
*NL*
most
three
weeks
ago
,
about
to
sign
that
contract
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
no
,
''
said
Chateau-Renaud
--
``
Did
you
know
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
spoke
to
her
once
or
twice
at
Madame
de
Morcerf
's
,
among
the
rest
;
*NL*
she
appeared
to
me
charming
,
though
rather
melancholy
.
Where
is
her
*NL*
stepmother
?
Do
you
know
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
spending
the
day
with
the
wife
of
the
worthy
gentleman
who
is
*NL*
receiving
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
he
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whom
do
you
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
gentleman
who
receives
us
?
Is
he
a
deputy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
.
I
am
condemned
to
witness
those
gentlemen
every
day
,
''
said
*NL*
Beauchamp
;
``
but
he
is
perfectly
unknown
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
mentioned
this
death
in
your
paper
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
has
been
mentioned
,
but
the
article
is
not
mine
;
indeed
,
I
doubt
if
*NL*
it
will
please
M.
Villefort
,
for
it
says
that
if
four
successive
deaths
*NL*
had
happened
anywhere
else
than
in
the
house
of
the
king
's
attorney
,
he
*NL*
would
have
interested
himself
somewhat
more
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Still
,
''
said
Chateau-Renaud
,
``
Dr.
d'Avrigny
,
who
attends
my
mother
,
*NL*
declares
he
is
in
despair
about
it
.
But
whom
are
you
seeking
,
Debray
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
seeking
the
Count
of
Monte
Cristo
''
said
the
young
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
met
him
on
the
boulevard
,
on
my
way
here
,
''
said
Beauchamp
.
``
I
think
*NL*
he
is
about
to
leave
Paris
;
he
was
going
to
his
banker
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
His
banker
?
Danglars
is
his
banker
,
is
he
not
?
''
asked
Chateau-Renaud
of
*NL*
Debray
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
so
,
''
replied
the
secretary
with
slight
uneasiness
.
``
But
Monte
*NL*
Cristo
is
not
the
only
one
I
miss
here
;
I
do
not
see
Morrel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Morrel
?
Do
they
know
him
?
''
asked
Chateau-Renaud
.
``
I
think
he
has
only
*NL*
been
introduced
to
Madame
de
Villefort
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Still
,
he
ought
to
have
been
here
,
''
said
Debray
;
``
I
wonder
what
will
*NL*
be
talked
about
to-night
;
this
funeral
is
the
news
of
the
day
.
But
hush
,
*NL*
here
comes
our
minister
of
justice
;
he
will
feel
obliged
to
make
some
*NL*
little
speech
to
the
cousin
,
''
and
the
three
young
men
drew
near
to
*NL*
listen
.
Beauchamp
told
the
truth
when
he
said
that
on
his
way
to
the
*NL*
funeral
he
had
met
Monte
Cristo
,
who
was
directing
his
steps
towards
the
*NL*
Rue
de
la
Chausse
d'Antin
,
to
M.
Danglars
'
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
banker
saw
the
carriage
of
the
count
enter
the
court
yard
,
and
*NL*
advanced
to
meet
him
with
a
sad
,
though
affable
smile
.
``
Well
,
''
said
*NL*
he
,
extending
his
hand
to
Monte
Cristo
,
``
I
suppose
you
have
come
to
*NL*
sympathize
with
me
,
for
indeed
misfortune
has
taken
possession
of
my
*NL*
house
.
When
I
perceived
you
,
I
was
just
asking
myself
whether
I
had
not
*NL*
wished
harm
towards
those
poor
Morcerfs
,
which
would
have
justified
the
*NL*
proverb
of
`
He
who
wishes
misfortunes
to
happen
to
others
experiences
*NL*
them
himself
.
'
Well
,
on
my
word
of
honor
,
I
answered
,
`
No
!
'
I
wished
*NL*
no
ill
to
Morcerf
;
he
was
a
little
proud
,
perhaps
,
for
a
man
who
like
*NL*
myself
has
risen
from
nothing
;
but
we
all
have
our
faults
.
Do
you
know
,
*NL*
count
,
that
persons
of
our
time
of
life
--
not
that
you
belong
to
the
*NL*
class
,
you
are
still
a
young
man
,
--
but
as
I
was
saying
,
persons
of
our
*NL*
time
of
life
have
been
very
unfortunate
this
year
.
For
example
,
look
at
*NL*
the
puritanical
procureur
,
who
has
just
lost
his
daughter
,
and
in
fact
*NL*
nearly
all
his
family
,
in
so
singular
a
manner
;
Morcerf
dishonored
*NL*
and
dead
;
and
then
myself
covered
with
ridicule
through
the
villany
of
*NL*
Benedetto
;
besides
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Besides
what
?
''
asked
the
Count
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas
,
do
you
not
know
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
new
calamity
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
daughter

--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mademoiselle
Danglars

*NL*
Danglars
looked
at

askance

as
though
to
ascertain
whether
he
spoke

seriously

Danglars
smiled
at
the
good-natured
pleasantry
of
the
*NL*
count

``
That
reminds
me
,

he
said
,
``
that
when

*NL*
*NL*
``

There
was
a
moment

silence

during
which
the
noise
of
the
banker
's
pen
*NL*
was
alone
heard
,
while
Monte

examined
the
gilt
mouldings
on
the
*NL*
ceiling

took

folding

And
Monte

placed
the

in
his
pocket
with
one
*NL*
hand

with

he
held
out
the

experienced
greater
terror

*NL*
*NL*
``

Monte

,
``

am
not

had
paid
me
five

without
a

it

have
been
remarkable

But
here

and
he
held
the
bonds
towards
Danglars

seized

them
like
a

extending
its
claws
to
withhold
the
food

wrested
from

Suddenly
he
rallied

made
a
violent
effort

to
restrain
himself

then
a
smile
gradually
widened
the
features

his
disturbed

the
perspiration
started
from
the

his
hair
.

*NL*
*NL*
Monte

replaced
the
notes
in
his
pocket
with
that
indescribable
*NL*
expression

seemed
to
say
,
``

reflect

repent
there
is

still
time

*NL*
*NL*

Danglars

formal

I
intended
this

money

I
seemed
to
be
robbing

did
not
*NL*
pay

absurd

as

not

began
to
laugh
loudly

*NL*
nervously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly

I
excuse
you

graciously
,
``

he
placed
the
bonds
in

pocket-book

nothing

*NL*
``

Danglars

you
speaking
seriously

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
joke

said
Monte

in
a
freezing
manner
,
*NL*
which
repelled
impertinence
;
and
he
turned
to
the
door
,
just
as
the
*NL*
valet
de
chambre
announced
,
--
``
M.
de
Boville

*NL*
charities

*NL*
``
Ma

said
Monte

;
``
I
think

arrived
just
in

obtain
*NL*
your
signatures
,
or
they
would
have
been
disputed
with

.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Danglars
again
became
pale
,
and
hastened
to
conduct
the
count
out
.
Monte
*NL*
Cristo
exchanged
a
ceremonious
bow
with
M.
de
Boville
,
who
was
standing
*NL*
in
the
waiting-room
,
and
who
was
introduced
into
Danglars
'
room
as
soon
*NL*
as
the
count
had
left
.
The
count
's
sad
face
was
illumined
by
a
faint
*NL*
smile
,
as
he
noticed
the
portfolio
which
the
receiver-general
held
in
*NL*
his
hand
.
At
the
door
he
found
his
carriage
,
and
was
immediately
driven
*NL*
to
the
bank
.
Meanwhile
Danglars
,
repressing
all
emotion
,
advanced
to
*NL*
meet
the
receiver-general
.
We
need
not
say
that
a
smile
of
condescension
*NL*
was
stamped
upon
his
lips
.
``
Good-morning
,
creditor
,
''
said
he
;
``
for
I
*NL*
wager
anything
it
is
the
creditor
who
visits
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
right

answered
M.
de
Boville
;
``

themselves

*NL*
``
And
yet

smiling

took

presented

read

I
must
confess

these

*NL*
*NL*

I
registered

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
much
did
they
possess
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

not
much

from

thirteen
hundred
thousand
francs

But
to

return
to

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly

''
said
Danglars
,
in
the
most
natural
tone
in
the
world
.
``
Are
*NL*
you
then
pressed
for
this
money

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

to-morrow

*NL*
*NL*
``
To-morrow

Why
did
you
not
tell
me
so
before

Why

it
is
as
good

At

``
At

*NL*

said
Danglars
,
smiling
.
M.
de
Boville
said
nothing
,
*NL*
but
nodded
his
head
,
and
took
up
the
portfolio
.
``
Now
I
think
of
it
,
you
*NL*
can
do
better

said
Danglars
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
mean

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
receipt

as
good
as
money

take
it

they
will
take
it
off
your

once

*NL*
*NL*
``
What

though
payable

Rome

*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly

cost
you

The
receiver
started
back
.
``

he
said
,
``
I
prefer
waiting
till

What
a
proposition

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought

perhaps

said
Danglars
with
supreme
impertinence
,
``
that

make
up

*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed

the
receiver

*NL*
*NL*
``
And

They

shook

``
By

M.

here

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

said
the
banker
;

I
have
appeared
rather
ridiculous

*NL*
*NL*
``
Bah

*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen

when

*NL*
*NL*

Danglars

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas

it
is
unhappily

too
true

The
day
after
the
event
,
she
*NL*
decided
on
leaving
Paris
with
a
nun
of
her
acquaintance
;
they
are
gone

very
strict

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

it

terrible

''
and
M.
de
Boville
retired
with
this
exclamation
,
*NL*
after
expressing
acute
sympathy
with
the
father
.
But
he
had
scarcely
*NL*
left
before
Danglars
,
with
an
energy
of
action
those
can
alone
*NL*
understand
who
have
seen
Robert

represented
by

-LSB-

*NL*
exclaimed
,
--
``

''
Then
enclosing
Monte
Cristo
's
receipt
in
a
little
*NL*
pocket-book
,
he
added
:
--
``
Yes
,
come
at
twelve
o'clock
;
I
shall
then
be
*NL*
far
away

''
Then
he
double-locked
his
door
,
emptied
all
his
drawers
,
*NL*
collected
about
fifty
thousand
francs
in
bank-notes
,
burned
several
*NL*
papers
,
left
others
exposed
to
view
,
and
then
commenced
writing
a

he
addressed

Chapter
105
.
The
Cemetery
of
Pere-la-Chaise
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
de
Boville
had
indeed
met
the
funeral
procession
which
was
taking
*NL*
Valentine
to
her
last
home
on
earth
.
The
weather
was
dull
and
stormy
,
a
*NL*
cold
wind
shook
the
few
remaining
yellow
leaves
from
the
boughs
of
the
*NL*
trees
,
and
scattered
them
among
the
crowd
which
filled
the
boulevards
.
*NL*
M.
de
Villefort
,
a
true
Parisian
,
considered
the
cemetery
of
*NL*
Pere-la-Chaise
alone
worthy
of
receiving
the
mortal
remains
of
a
*NL*
Parisian
family
;
there
alone
the
corpses
belonging
to
him
would
be
*NL*
surrounded
by
worthy
associates
.
He
had
therefore
purchased
a
vault
,
*NL*
which
was
quickly
occupied
by
members
of
his
family
.
On
the
front
of
the
*NL*
monument
was
inscribed
:
``
The
families
of
Saint-Meran
and
Villefort
,
''
for
*NL*
such
had
been
the
last
wish
expressed
by
poor
Renee
,
Valentine
's
mother
.
*NL*
The
pompous
procession
therefore
wended
its
way
towards
Pere-la-Chaise
*NL*
from
the
Faubourg
Saint-Honore
.
Having
crossed
Paris
,
it
passed
through
*NL*
the
Faubourg
du
Temple
,
then
leaving
the
exterior
boulevards
,
it
reached
*NL*
the
cemetery
.
More
than
fifty
private
carriages
followed
the
twenty
*NL*
mourning-coaches
,
and
behind
them
more
than
five
hundred
persons
joined
*NL*
in
the
procession
on
foot
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
last
consisted
of
all
the
young
people
whom
Valentine
's
death
had
*NL*
struck
like
a
thunderbolt
,
and
who
,
notwithstanding
the
raw
chilliness
*NL*
of
the
season
,
could
not
refrain
from
paying
a
last
tribute
to
the
*NL*
memory
of
the
beautiful
,
chaste
,
and
adorable
girl
,
thus
cut
off
in
the
*NL*
flower
of
her
youth
.
As
they
left
Paris
,
an
equipage
with
four
horses
,
*NL*
at
full
speed
,
was
seen
to
draw
up
suddenly
;
it
contained
Monte
Cristo
.
*NL*
The
count
left
the
carriage
and
mingled
in
the
crowd
who
followed
on
*NL*
foot
.
Chateau-Renaud
perceived
him
and
immediately
alighting
from
his
*NL*
coupe
,
joined
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
count
looked
attentively
through
every
opening
in
the
crowd
;
he
was
*NL*
evidently
watching
for
some
one
,
but
his
search
ended
in
disappointment
.
*NL*
``
Where
is
Morrel
?
''
he
asked
;
``
do
either
of
these
gentlemen
know
where
he
*NL*
is
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
already
asked
that
question
,
''
said
Chateau-Renaud
,
``
for
none
*NL*
of
us
has
seen
him
.
''
The
count
was
silent
,
but
continued
to
gaze
around
*NL*
him
.
At
length
they
arrived
at
the
cemetery
.
The
piercing
eye
of
Monte
*NL*
Cristo
glanced
through
clusters
of
bushes
and
trees
,
and
was
soon
*NL*
relieved
from
all
anxiety
,
for
seeing
a
shadow
glide
between
the
*NL*
yew-trees
,
Monte
Cristo
recognized
him
whom
he
sought
.
One
funeral
is
*NL*
generally
very
much
like
another
in
this
magnificent
metropolis
.
Black
*NL*
figures
are
seen
scattered
over
the
long
white
avenues
;
the
silence
*NL*
of
earth
and
heaven
is
alone
broken
by
the
noise
made
by
the
crackling
*NL*
branches
of
hedges
planted
around
the
monuments
;
then
follows
the
*NL*
melancholy
chant
of
the
priests
,
mingled
now
and
then
with
a
sob
of
*NL*
anguish
,
escaping
from
some
woman
concealed
behind
a
mass
of
flowers
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
shadow
Monte
Cristo
had
noticed
passed
rapidly
behind
the
tomb
of
*NL*
Abelard
and
Heloise
,
placed
itself
close
to
the
heads
of
the
horses
*NL*
belonging
to
the
hearse
,
and
following
the
undertaker
's
men
,
arrived
*NL*
with
them
at
the
spot
appointed
for
the
burial
.
Each
person
's
attention
*NL*
was
occupied
.
Monte
Cristo
saw
nothing
but
the
shadow
,
which
no
one
else
*NL*
observed
.
Twice
the
count
left
the
ranks
to
see
whether
the
object
of
*NL*
his
interest
had
any
concealed
weapon
beneath
his
clothes
.
When
the
*NL*
procession
stopped
,
this
shadow
was
recognized
as
Morrel
,
who
,
with
*NL*
his
coat
buttoned
up
to
his
throat
,
his
face
livid
,
and
convulsively
*NL*
crushing
his
hat
between
his
fingers
,
leaned
against
a
tree
,
situated
*NL*
on
an
elevation
commanding
the
mausoleum
,
so
that
none
of
the
funeral
*NL*
details
could
escape
his
observation
.
Everything
was
conducted
in
*NL*
the
usual
manner
.
A
few
men
,
the
least
impressed
of
all
by
the
scene
,
*NL*
pronounced
a
discourse
,
some
deploring
this
premature
death
,
others
*NL*
expatiating
on
the
grief
of
the
father
,
and
one
very
ingenious
person
*NL*
quoting
the
fact
that
Valentine
had
solicited
pardon
of
her
father
for
*NL*
criminals
on
whom
the
arm
of
justice
was
ready
to
fall
--
until
at
length
*NL*
they
exhausted
their
stores
of
metaphor
and
mournful
speeches
.
*NL*
*NL*
Monte
Cristo
heard
and
saw
nothing
,
or
rather
he
only
saw
Morrel
,
whose
*NL*
calmness
had
a
frightful
effect
on
those
who
knew
what
was
passing
in
*NL*
his
heart
.
``
See
,
''
said
Beauchamp
,
pointing
out
Morrel
to
Debray
.
``
What
*NL*
is
he
doing
up
there
?
''
And
they
called
Chateau-Renaud
's
attention
to
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
pale
he
is
!
''
said
Chateau-Renaud
,
shuddering
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
cold
,
''
said
Debray
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all
,
''
said
Chateau-Renaud
,
slowly
;
``
I
think
he
is
violently
*NL*
agitated
.
He
is
very
susceptible
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bah
,
''
said
Debray
;
``
he
scarcely
knew
Mademoiselle
de
Villefort
;
you
*NL*
said
so
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
True
.
Still
I
remember
he
danced
three
times
with
her
at
Madame
de
*NL*
Morcerf
's
.
Do
you
recollect
that
ball
,
count
,
where
you
produced
such
an
*NL*
effect
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
do
not
,
''
replied
Monte
Cristo
,
without
even
knowing
of
what
or
*NL*
to
whom
he
was
speaking
,
so
much
was
he
occupied
in
watching
Morrel
,
who
*NL*
was
holding
his
breath
with
emotion
.
``
The
discourse
is
over
;
farewell
,
*NL*
gentlemen
,
''
said
the
count
.
And
he
disappeared
without
anyone
seeing
*NL*
whither
he
went
.
The
funeral
being
over
,
the
guests
returned
to
Paris
.
*NL*
Chateau-Renaud
looked
for
a
moment
for
Morrel
;
but
while
they
were
*NL*
watching
the
departure
of
the
count
,
Morrel
had
quitted
his
post
,
and
*NL*
Chateau-Renaud
,
failing
in
his
search
,
joined
Debray
and
Beauchamp
.
*NL*
*NL*
Monte
Cristo
concealed
himself
behind
a
large
tomb
and
awaited
the
*NL*
arrival
of
Morrel
,
who
by
degrees
approached
the
tomb
now
abandoned
*NL*
by
spectators
and
workmen
.
Morrel
threw
a
glance
around
,
but
before
it
*NL*
reached
the
spot
occupied
by
Monte
Cristo
the
latter
had
advanced
yet
*NL*
nearer
,
still
unperceived
.
The
young
man
knelt
down
.
The
count
,
with
*NL*
outstretched
neck
and
glaring
eyes
,
stood
in
an
attitude
ready
to
*NL*
pounce
upon
Morrel
upon
the
first
occasion
.
Morrel
bent
his
head
till
*NL*
it
touched
the
stone
,
then
clutching
the
grating
with
both
hands
,
*NL*
he
murmured
,
--
``
Oh
,
Valentine
!
''
The
count
's
heart
was
pierced
by
the
*NL*
utterance
of
these
two
words
;
he
stepped
forward
,
and
touching
the
young
*NL*
man
's
shoulder
,
said
,
--
``
I
was
looking
for
you
,
my
friend
.
''
Monte
Cristo
*NL*
expected
a
burst
of
passion
,
but
he
was
deceived
,
for
Morrel
turning
*NL*
round
,
said
calmly
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
I
was
praying
.
''
The
scrutinizing
glance
of
the
count
searched
*NL*
the
young
man
from
head
to
foot
.
He
then
seemed
more
easy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
I
drive
you
back
to
Paris
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
thank
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
wish
anything
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Leave
me
to
pray
.
''
The
count
withdrew
without
opposition
,
but
it
was
*NL*
only
to
place
himself
in
a
situation
where
he
could
watch
every
movement
*NL*
of
Morrel
,
who
at
length
arose
,
brushed
the
dust
from
his
knees
,
and
*NL*
turned
towards
Paris
,
without
once
looking
back
.
He
walked
slowly
down
*NL*
the
Rue
de
la
Roquette
.
The
count
,
dismissing
his
carriage
,
followed
him
*NL*
about
a
hundred
paces
behind
.
Maximilian
crossed
the
canal
and
entered
*NL*
the
Rue
Meslay
by
the
boulevards
.
Five
minutes
after
the
door
had
been
*NL*
closed
on
Morrel
's
entrance
,
it
was
again
opened
for
the
count
.
Julie
*NL*
was
at
the
entrance
of
the
garden
,
where
she
was
attentively
watching
*NL*
Penelon
,
who
,
entering
with
zeal
into
his
profession
of
gardener
,
was
*NL*
very
busy
grafting
some
Bengal
roses
.
``
Ah
,
count
,
''
she
exclaimed
,
with
*NL*
the
delight
manifested
by
every
member
of
the
family
whenever
he
visited
*NL*
the
Rue
Meslay
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Maximilian
has
just
returned
,
has
he
not
,
madame
?
''
asked
the
count
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
think
I
saw
him
pass
;
but
pray
,
call
Emmanuel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excuse
me
,
madame
,
but
I
must
go
up
to
Maximilian
's
room
this
instant
,
''
*NL*
replied
Monte
Cristo
,
``
I
have
something
of
the
greatest
importance
to
*NL*
tell
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
,
then
,
''
she
said
with
a
charming
smile
,
which
accompanied
him
until
*NL*
he
had
disappeared
.
Monte
Cristo
soon
ran
up
the
staircase
conducting
*NL*
from
the
ground-floor
to
Maximilian
's
room
;
when
he
reached
the
landing
*NL*
he
listened
attentively
,
but
all
was
still
.
Like
many
old
houses
*NL*
occupied
by
a
single
family
,
the
room
door
was
panelled
with
glass
;
but
*NL*
it
was
locked
,
Maximilian
was
shut
in
,
and
it
was
impossible
to
see
*NL*
what
was
passing
in
the
room
,
because
a
red
curtain
was
drawn
before
the
*NL*
glass
.
The
count
's
anxiety
was
manifested
by
a
bright
color
which
seldom
*NL*
appeared
on
the
face
of
that
imperturbable
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
shall
I
do
!
''
he
uttered
,
and
reflected
for
a
moment
;
``
shall
I
*NL*
ring
?
No
,
the
sound
of
a
bell
,
announcing
a
visitor
,
will
but
accelerate
*NL*
the
resolution
of
one
in
Maximilian
's
situation
,
and
then
the
bell
would
*NL*
be
followed
by
a
louder
noise
.
''
Monte
Cristo
trembled
from
head
to
*NL*
foot
and
as
if
his
determination
had
been
taken
with
the
rapidity
of
*NL*
lightning
,
he
struck
one
of
the
panes
of
glass
with
his
elbow
;
the
glass
*NL*
was
shivered
to
atoms
,
then
withdrawing
the
curtain
he
saw
Morrel
,
who
*NL*
had
been
writing
at
his
desk
,
bound
from
his
seat
at
the
noise
of
the
*NL*
broken
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beg
a
thousand
pardons
,
''
said
the
count
,
``
there
is
nothing
the
*NL*
matter
,
but
I
slipped
down
and
broke
one
of
your
panes
of
glass
with
*NL*
my
elbow
.
Since
it
is
opened
,
I
will
take
advantage
of
it
to
enter
your
*NL*
room
;
do
not
disturb
yourself
--
do
not
disturb
yourself
!
''
And
passing
*NL*
his
hand
through
the
broken
glass
,
the
count
opened
the
door
.
Morrel
,
*NL*
evidently
discomposed
,
came
to
meet
Monte
Cristo
less
with
the
intention
*NL*
of
receiving
him
than
to
exclude
his
entry
.
``
Ma
foi
,
''
said
Monte
Cristo
,
*NL*
rubbing
his
elbow
,
``
it
's
all
your
servant

fault

your

are
so

polished

it
is

glass

*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
hurt

coldly
asked
Morrel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
not

But
what
are
you
about
there
?
You
were
writing

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your

are
stained
with

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

true
,
I
was
writing

I
do
sometimes
,
soldier
though
I
am

''
*NL*
*NL*
Monte
Cristo
advanced
into
the
room
;
Maximilian
was
obliged
to
let
him
*NL*
pass
,
but
he
followed
him
.
``
You
were
writing
?
''
said
Monte
Cristo
with
a
*NL*
searching
look
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
already
had
the
honor
of
telling
you
I
was

said
Morrel
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
count
looked
around
him
.
``
Your
pistols
are
beside
your
desk
,
''
said
*NL*
Monte
Cristo
,
pointing
with
his
finger
to
the
pistols
on
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
on
the
point
of
starting
on
a
journey

replied
Morrel
*NL*
disdainfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
friend

exclaimed
Monte
Cristo
in
a
tone
of
exquisite
sweetness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir

*NL*
*NL*
``
My

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
make

said
Morrel
,
shrugging
his
shoulders
;
``
is
*NL*
there
anything
extraordinary
in
a
journey

*NL*
*NL*
``
Maximilian

said
the

,
``

us
both
lay
aside
the

You
no

I
impose

upon

my
frivolous

have
been

*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed

Morrel

shuddering
;

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
tell

continued
the
*NL*
count
,
``

here
is
proof
of
what
I

and
,
approaching
the
desk
,
he
*NL*
removed
the
sheet
of
paper
which
Morrel
had
placed
over
the
letter
he
*NL*
had
begun
,
and
took
the
latter
in
his
hands

*NL*
*NL*
Morrel
rushed
forward
to
tear
it
from
him
,
but
Monte
Cristo
perceiving
*NL*
his
intention
,
seized
his
wrist
with
his
iron
grasp
.
``
You
wish
to
*NL*
destroy
yourself
,

said
the
count
;
``
you
have
written
it

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

''
said
Morrel
,
changing
his
expression
of
calmness
for
one
of
*NL*
violence
--
``
well

if
I
do

turn
this

dare

All
my
hopes

blighted

my

is
broken

my
life
a
burden

everything
around
me
is
*NL*
sad

mournful
;
earth
has
become
distasteful

me

human
voices

distract
me

It

a
mercy
to
let

live
I

become

When

putting

Tell

you
have

the
courage

do
so

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

Morrel

said
Monte

,
with
a
calmness
which
contrasted
*NL*
strangely
with
the
young
man
's
excitement
;
``
yes

I
would
do
so

*NL*
*NL*
``
You

Morrel

with
increasing
anger

reproach

enact
the

guardian

could
not
even
find
an
antidote
to
a
poison
administered
*NL*
to
a
young

Ah

indeed
you
would
inspire
me

When
you
spoke
to
me
at

I
answered
you

my
heart
was
*NL*
softened
;
when
you
arrived
here

I
allowed
you
to
enter
.
But
since
*NL*
you
abuse
my
confidence
,
since
you
have
devised
a
new
torture
after
*NL*
I
thought
I
had
exhausted
them
all
,
then
,
Count
of
Monte

my
*NL*
pretended
benefactor

Count
of
Monte

the
universal
*NL*
guardian

be
satisfied

shall
witness
the
death

and
*NL*
Morrel
,
with
a
maniacal
laugh

again
rushed
towards
the
pistols

*NL*
``
And
I
again
repeat

you
shall
not

*NL*
*NL*
``
Prevent

replied
Morrel
,
with
another
struggle
,
which
,
like
*NL*
the
first
,
failed
in
releasing
him
from
the
count
's
iron
grasp

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*

Monte

and
Monte

,
with
an
expression
of
majesty
*NL*
and
sublimity
,
advanced
with
arms
folded
toward
the
young
man
,
who
,
*NL*
involuntarily
overcome
by
the
commanding
manner
of
this
man
,
recoiled
a
*NL*
step
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
you
mention
my
father

''
stammered
he
;
``
why
do
you
mingle
a
*NL*
recollection

him

*NL*
*NL*

Because
I
am
he

the
man

sent
the
purse

to
your
young
sister

and
the
Pharaon
to
old
Morrel

am
the
*NL*
Edmond
Dantes
who
nursed
you

a
child
,
on
my
knees

Morrel
made
another
*NL*
step
back
,
staggering
,
breathless
,
crushed
;
then
all
his
strength
*NL*
give
way
,
and
he
fell
prostrate
at
the
feet
of
Monte
Cristo
.
Then
his
*NL*
admirable
nature
underwent
a
complete
and
sudden
revulsion
;
he
arose
,
*NL*
rushed
out
of
the
room
and
to
the
stairs
,
exclaiming
energetically
,
*NL*
``
Julie
,
Julie
--
Emmanuel
,
Emmanuel
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Monte
Cristo
endeavored
also
to
leave
,
but
Maximilian
would
have
died
*NL*
rather
than
relax
his
hold
of
the
handle
of
the
door
,
which
he
closed
*NL*
upon
the
count
.
Julie
,
Emmanuel
,
and
some
of
the
servants
,
ran
up
in
*NL*
alarm
on
hearing
the
cries
of
Maximilian
.
Morrel
seized
their
hands
,
*NL*
and
opening
the
door
exclaimed
in
a
voice
choked
with
sobs
,
``
On
your
*NL*
knees
--
on
your
knees
--
he
is
our
benefactor
--
the
saviour
of
our
father

*NL*
He
is

--
*NL*
*NL*
He
would
have
added
``
Edmond
Dantes
,
''
but
the
count
seized
his
arm
and
*NL*
prevented
him
.
Julie
threw
herself
into
the
arms
of
the
count
;
Emmanuel
*NL*
embraced
him
as
a
guardian
angel
;
Morrel
again
fell
on
his
knees
,
and
*NL*
struck
the
ground
with
his
forehead
.
Then
the
iron-hearted
man
felt
his
*NL*
heart
swell
in
his
breast
;
a
flame
seemed
to
rush
from
his
throat
to
his
*NL*
eyes
,
he
bent
his
head
and
wept
.
For
a
while
nothing
was
heard
in
the
*NL*
room
but
a
succession
of
sobs
,
while
the
incense
from
their
grateful
*NL*
hearts
mounted
to
heaven
.
Julie
had
scarcely
recovered
from
her
deep
*NL*
emotion
when
she
rushed
out
of
the
room
,
descended
to
the
next
floor
,
*NL*
ran
into
the
drawing-room
with
childlike
joy
and
raised
the
crystal
*NL*
globe
which
covered
the
purse
given
by
the
unknown
of
the
Allees
de
*NL*
Meillan
.
Meanwhile
,
Emmanuel
in
a
broken
voice
said
to
the
count
,
*NL*
``
Oh
,
count
,
how
could
you
,
hearing
us
so
often
speak
of
our
unknown
*NL*
benefactor
,
seeing
us
pay
such
homage
of
gratitude
and
adoration
to
his
*NL*
memory
,
--
how
could
you
continue
so
long
without
discovering
yourself
to
*NL*
us
?
Oh
,
it
was
cruel
to
us
,
and
--
dare
I
say
it
?
--
to
you
also
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
,
my
friends
,
''
said
the
count
--
``
I
may
call
you
so
since
we
have
*NL*
really
been
friends
for
the
last
eleven
years
--
the
discovery
of
this
*NL*
secret
has
been
occasioned
by
a
great
event
which
you
must
never
know
.
*NL*
I
wished
to
bury
it
during
my
whole
life
in
my
own
bosom
,
but
your
brother
*NL*
Maximilian
wrested
it
from
me
by
a
violence
he
repents
of
now
,
I
am
*NL*
sure
.
''
Then
turning
around
,
and
seeing
that
Morrel
,
still
on
his
knees
,
*NL*
had
thrown
himself
into
an
arm-chair
,
he
added
in
a
low
voice
,
pressing
*NL*
Emmanuel
's
hand
significantly
,
``
Watch
over
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
so
?
''
asked
the
young
man
,
surprised
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
explain
myself
;
but
watch
over
him
.
''
Emmanuel
looked
around
*NL*
the
room
and
caught
sight
of
the
pistols
;
his
eyes
rested
on
the
*NL*
weapons
,
and
he
pointed
to
them
.
Monte
Cristo
bent
his
head
.
Emmanuel
*NL*
went
towards
the
pistols
.
``
Leave
them
,
''
said
Monte
Cristo
.
Then
walking
*NL*
towards
Morrel
,
he
took
his
hand
;
the
tumultuous
agitation
of
the
young
*NL*
man
was
succeeded
by
a
profound
stupor
.
Julie
returned
,
holding
the
*NL*
silken
purse
in
her
hands
,
while
tears
of
joy
rolled
down
her
cheeks
,
*NL*
like
dewdrops
on
the
rose
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
is
the
relic
,
''
she
said
;
``
do
not
think
it
will
be
less
dear
to
us
*NL*
now
we
are
acquainted
with
our
benefactor
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
child
,
''
said
Monte
Cristo
,
coloring
,
``
allow
me
to
take
back
that
*NL*
purse
?
Since
you
now
know
my
face

I
wish
to

alone
through
*NL*
the
affection
I
hope
you
will
grant
me

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

said
Julie
,
pressing
the
purse
to
her
heart
,
``
no

no

I
beseech
*NL*
you

not

it

will
you
*NL*
not

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
guessed
rightly

madame

''
replied
Monte
Cristo
,
smiling
;
``
in
a
*NL*
week
I
shall
have
left
this
country

where
so
many
persons

merit

vengeance
of
heaven
lived
happily
,
while
my
father
perished
of
hunger
*NL*
and
grief
.
''
While
announcing
his
departure
,
the
count
fixed
his
eyes
on
*NL*
Morrel
,
and
remarked
that
the
words
,
``
I
shall
have
left
this
country
,
''
*NL*
had
failed
to
rouse
him
from
his
lethargy
.
He
then
saw
that
he
must
make
*NL*
another
struggle
against
the
grief
of
his
friend
,
and
taking
the
hands
*NL*
of
Emmanuel
and
Julie
,
which
he
pressed
within
his
own
,
he
said
with
*NL*
the
mild
authority
of
a
father
,
``
My
kind
friends
,
leave
me
alone
with
*NL*
Maximilian
.
''
Julie
saw
the
means
offered
of
carrying
off
her
precious
*NL*
relic
,
which
Monte
Cristo
had
forgotten
.
She
drew
her
husband
to
the
*NL*
door
.
``
Let
us
leave
them
,
''
she
said
.
The
count
was
alone
with
Morrel
,
*NL*
who
remained
motionless
as
a
statue
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
''
said
Monte-Cristo
,
touching
his
shoulder
with
his
finger
,
``
are
*NL*
you
a
man
again
,
Maximilian
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
for
I
begin
to
suffer
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
count
frowned
,
apparently
in
gloomy
hesitation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Maximilian
,
Maximilian
,
''
he
said
,
``
the
ideas
you
yield
to
are
unworthy
*NL*
of
a
Christian
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
do
not
fear
,
my
friend
,
''
said
Morrel
,
raising
his
head
,
and
smiling
*NL*
with
a
sweet
expression
on
the
count
;
``
I
shall
no
longer
attempt
my
*NL*
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
we
are
to
have
no
more
pistols
--
no
more
despair
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
I
have
found
a
better
remedy
for
my
grief
than
either
a
bullet
or
a
*NL*
knife
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
fellow
,
what
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
grief
will
kill
me
of
itself

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
friend

''
said
Monte
Cristo
,
with
an
expression
of
melancholy
equal
*NL*
to
his
own
,
``
listen
to
me
.
One
day
,
in
a
moment
of
despair
like
yours
,
*NL*
since
it
led
to
a
similar
resolution
,
I
also
wished
to
kill
myself
;
one
*NL*
day
your
father
,
equally
desperate
,
wished
to
kill
himself
too

If
any
*NL*
one
had
said

your

at
the
moment
he
raised
the

his

be
happy

and
will
bless

no
matter
whose
voice
had
spoken
,
we
should
have
heard
him
with
*NL*
the
smile
of
doubt
,
or
the
anguish
of
incredulity
,
--
and
yet
how
many
*NL*
times
has
your
father
blessed
life
while
embracing
you

how
often
have
I
*NL*
myself
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

exclaimed
Morrel
,
interrupting
the
count
,
``
you
had
only
lost
*NL*
your
liberty

only
lost
his

I

Valentine

*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
at

said
Monte
Cristo
,
with
that
expression
which
sometimes
*NL*
made
him
so
eloquent
and
persuasive
--
``

at
me

There
are
no

yet
I
see
you
suffer

you

*NL*
Maximilian

I
love

Well

does
not
this
tell
you
*NL*
that
in
grief

as
in

there
is
always
something

Now
,
if
I
entreat
,

I
order
you
to
live

Morrel

it
is
in

the
conviction

one

will
thank
me
for
having
preserved
your

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

the

Take

*NL*

I
reached

*NL*
Well

at
twenty-nine

saw
Valentine

seen
written
in

all

Morrel

dropped

Morrel
seized

kissed

allowed

Dividing
the
Proceeds
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
apartment
on
the
second
floor
of
the
house
in
the
Rue
*NL*
Saint-Germain-des-Pres
,
where
Albert
de
Morcerf
had
selected
a
home
for
*NL*
his
mother
,
was
let
to
a
very
mysterious
person
.
This
was
a
man
whose
*NL*
face
the
concierge
himself
had
never
seen
,
for
in
the
winter
his
chin
*NL*
was
buried
in
one
of
the
large
red
handkerchiefs
worn
by
gentlemen
's
*NL*
coachmen
on
a
cold
night
,
and
in
the
summer
he
made
a
point
of
always
*NL*
blowing
his
nose
just
as
he
approached
the
door
.
Contrary
to
custom
,
*NL*
this
gentleman
had
not
been
watched
,
for
as
the
report
ran
that
he
was
*NL*
a
person
of
high
rank
,
and
one
who
would
allow
no
impertinent
*NL*
interference
,
his
incognito
was
strictly
respected
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
visits
were
tolerably
regular
,
though
occasionally
he
appeared
*NL*
a
little
before
or
after
his
time
,
but
generally
,
both
in
summer
and
*NL*
winter
,
he
took
possession
of
his
apartment
about
four
o'clock
,
though
*NL*
he
never
spent
the
night
there
.
At
half-past
three
in
the
winter
the
*NL*
fire
was
lighted
by
the
discreet
servant
,
who
had
the
superintendence
of
*NL*
the
little
apartment
,
and
in
the
summer
ices
were
placed
on
the
table
*NL*
at
the
same
hour
.
At
four
o'clock
,
as
we
have
already
stated
,
the
*NL*
mysterious
personage
arrived
.
Twenty
minutes
afterwards
a
carriage
*NL*
stopped
at
the
house
,
a
lady
alighted
in
a
black
or
dark
blue
dress
,
and
*NL*
always
thickly
veiled
;
she
passed
like
a
shadow
through
the
lodge
,
and
*NL*
ran
up-stairs
without
a
sound
escaping
under
the
touch
of
her
light
*NL*
foot
.
No
one
ever
asked
her
where
she
was
going
.
Her
face
,
therefore
,
*NL*
like
that
of
the
gentleman
,
was
perfectly
unknown
to
the
two
concierges
,
*NL*
who
were
perhaps
unequalled
throughout
the
capital
for
discretion
.
*NL*
We
need
not
say
she
stopped
at
the
second
floor
.
Then
she
tapped
in
a
*NL*
peculiar
manner
at
a
door
,
which
after
being
opened
to
admit
her
was
*NL*
again
fastened
,
and
curiosity
penetrated
no
farther
.
They
used
the
same
*NL*
precautions
in
leaving
as
in
entering
the
house
.
The
lady
always
left
*NL*
first
,
and
as
soon
as
she
had
stepped
into
her
carriage
,
it
drove
away
,
*NL*
sometimes
towards
the
right
hand
,
sometimes
to
the
left
;
then
about
*NL*
twenty
minutes
afterwards
the
gentleman
would
also
leave
,
buried
in
his
*NL*
cravat
or
concealed
by
his
handkerchief
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
day
after
Monte
Cristo
had
called
upon
Danglars
,
the
mysterious
*NL*
lodger
entered
at
ten
o'clock
in
the
morning
instead
of
four
in
the
*NL*
afternoon
.
Almost
directly
afterwards
,
without
the
usual
interval
of
*NL*
time
,
a
cab
arrived
,
and
the
veiled
lady
ran
hastily
up-stairs
.
The
*NL*
door
opened
,
but
before
it
could
be
closed
,
the
lady
exclaimed
:
``
Oh
,
*NL*
Lucien
--
oh
,
my
friend
!
''
The
concierge
therefore
heard
for
the
first
time
*NL*
that
the
lodger
's
name
was
Lucien
;
still
,
as
he
was
the
very
perfection
*NL*
of
a
door-keeper
,
he
made
up
his
mind
not
to
tell
his
wife
.
``
Well
,
*NL*
what
is
the
matter
,
my
dear
?
''
asked
the
gentleman
whose
name
the
lady
's
*NL*
agitation
revealed
;
``
tell
me
what
is
the
matter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Lucien
,
can
I
confide
in
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
,
you
know
you
can
do
so
.
But
what
can
be
the
matter
?
*NL*
Your
note
of
this
morning
has
completely
bewildered
me
.
This
*NL*
precipitation
--
this
unusual
appointment
.
Come
,
ease
me
of
my
anxiety
,
or
*NL*
else
frighten
me
at
once
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lucien
,
a
great
event
has
happened
!
''
said
the
lady
,
glancing
*NL*
inquiringly
at
Lucien
,
--
``
M.
Danglars
left
last
night
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Left
?
--
M.
Danglars
left
?
Where
has
he
gone
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
?
Has
he
gone
intending
not
to
return
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Undoubtedly
;
--
at
ten
o'clock
at
night
his
horses
took
him
to
the
*NL*
barrier
of
Charenton
;
there
a
post-chaise
was
waiting
for
him
--
he
*NL*
entered
it
with
his
valet
de
chambre
,
saying
that
he
was
going
to
*NL*
Fontainebleau
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
what
did
you
mean
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stay
--
he
left
a
letter
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
letter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
read
it
.
''
And
the
baroness
took
from
her
pocket
a
letter
which
she
*NL*
gave
to
Debray
.
Debray
paused
a
moment
before
reading
,
as
if
trying
*NL*
to
guess
its
contents
,
or
perhaps
while
making
up
his
mind
how
to
act
,
*NL*
whatever
it
might
contain
.
No
doubt
his
ideas
were
arranged
in
a
few
*NL*
minutes
,
for
he
began
reading
the
letter
which
caused
so
much
uneasiness
*NL*
in
the
heart
of
the
baroness
,
and
which
ran
as
follows
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madame
and
most
faithful
wife
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Debray
mechanically
stopped
and
looked
at
the
baroness
,
whose
face
*NL*
became
covered
with
blushes
.
``
Read
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Debray
continued
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
you
receive
this
,
you
will
no
longer
have
a
husband
.
Oh
,
you
*NL*
need
not
be
alarmed
,
you
will
only
have
lost
him
as
you
have
lost
your
*NL*
daughter
;
I
mean
that
I
shall
be
travelling
on
one
of
the
thirty
or
*NL*
forty
roads
leading
out
of
France
.
I
owe
you
some
explanations
for
my
*NL*
conduct
,
and
as
you
are
a
woman
that
can
perfectly
understand
me
,
I
will
*NL*
give
them
.
Listen
,
then
.
I
received
this
morning
five
millions
which
I
*NL*
paid
away
;
almost
directly
afterwards
another
demand
for
the
same
sum
*NL*
was
presented
to
me
;
I
put
this
creditor
off
till
to-morrow
and
I
intend
*NL*
leaving
to-day
,
to
escape
that
to-morrow
,
which
would
be
rather
too
*NL*
unpleasant
for
me
to
endure
.
You
understand
this
,
do
you
not
,
my
most
*NL*
precious
wife
?
I
say
you
understand
this
,
because
you
are
as
conversant
*NL*
with
my
affairs
as
I
am
;
indeed
,
I
think
you
understand
them
better
,
*NL*
since
I
am
ignorant
of
what
has
become
of
a
considerable
portion
of
my
*NL*
fortune
,
once
very
tolerable
,
while
I
am
sure
,
madame
,
that
you
know
*NL*
perfectly
well
.
For
women
have
infallible
instincts
;
they
can
even
*NL*
explain
the
marvellous
by
an
algebraic
calculation
they
have
invented
;
*NL*
but
I
,
who
only
understand
my
own
figures
,
know
nothing
more
than
that
*NL*
one
day
these
figures
deceived
me
.
Have
you
admired
the
rapidity
of
my
*NL*
fall
?
Have
you
been
slightly
dazzled
at
the
sudden
fusion
of
my
ingots
?
*NL*
I
confess
I
have
seen
nothing
but
the
fire
;
let
us
hope
you
have
found
*NL*
some
gold
among
the
ashes
.
With
this
consoling
idea
,
I
leave
you
,
*NL*
madame
,
and
most
prudent
wife
,
without
any
conscientious
reproach
for
*NL*
abandoning
you
;
you
have
friends
left
,
and
the
ashes
I
have
already
*NL*
mentioned
,
and
above
all
the
liberty
I
hasten
to
restore
to
you
.
And
*NL*
here
,
madame
,
I
must
add
another
word
of
explanation
.
So
long
as
I
hoped
*NL*
you
were
working
for
the
good
of
our
house
and
for
the
fortune
of
our
*NL*
daughter
,
I
philosophically
closed
my
eyes
;
but
as
you
have
transformed
*NL*
that
house
into
a
vast
ruin
I
will
not
be
the
foundation
of
another
*NL*
man
's
fortune
.
You
were
rich
when
I
married
you
,
but
little
respected
.
*NL*
Excuse
me
for
speaking
so
very
candidly
,
but
as
this
is
intended
*NL*
only
for
ourselves
,
I
do
not
see
why
I
should
weigh
my
words
.
I
have
*NL*
augmented
our
fortune
,
and
it
has
continued
to
increase
during
the
*NL*
last
fifteen
years
,
till
extraordinary
and
unexpected
catastrophes
*NL*
have
suddenly
overturned
it
,
--
without
any
fault
of
mine
,
I
can
honestly
*NL*
declare
.
You
,
madame
,
have
only
sought
to
increase
your
own
,
and
I
am
*NL*
convinced
that
you
have
succeeded
.
I
leave
you
,
therefore
,
as
I
took
*NL*
you
,
--
rich
,
but
little
respected
.
Adieu
!
I
also
intend
from
this
time
*NL*
to
work
on
my
own
account
.
Accept
my
acknowledgments
for
the
example
you
*NL*
have
set
me
,
and
which
I
intend
following
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
very
devoted
husband
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
Baron
Danglars
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
baroness
had
watched
Debray
while
he
read
this
long
and
painful
*NL*
letter
,
and
saw
him
,
notwithstanding
his
self-control
,
change
color
*NL*
once
or
twice
.
When
he
had
ended
the
perusal
,
he
folded
the
letter
and
*NL*
resumed
his
pensive
attitude
.
``
Well
?
''
asked
Madame
Danglars
,
with
an
*NL*
anxiety
easy
to
be
understood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
madame
?
''
unhesitatingly
repeated
Debray
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
what
ideas
does
that
letter
inspire
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it
is
simple
enough
,
madame
;
it
inspires
me
with
the
idea
that
M.
*NL*
Danglars
has
left
suspiciously
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
;
but
is
this
all
you
have
to
say
to
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
understand
you
,
''
said
Debray
with
freezing
coldness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
gone
!
Gone
,
never
to
return
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
madame
,
do
not
think
that
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
tell
you
he
will
never
return
.
I
know
his
character
;
he
is
inflexible
*NL*
in
any
resolutions
formed
for
his
own
interests
.
If
he
could
have
made
*NL*
any
use
of
me
,
he
would
have
taken
me
with
him
;
he
leaves
me
in
Paris
,
*NL*
as
our
separation
will
conduce
to
his
benefit
;
--
therefore
he
has
gone
,
*NL*
and
I
am
free
forever
,
''
added
Madame
Danglars
,
in
the
same
supplicating
*NL*
tone
.
Debray
,
instead
of
answering
,
allowed
her
to
remain
in
an
attitude
*NL*
of
nervous
inquiry
.
``
Well
?
''
she
said
at
length
,
``
do
you
not
answer
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
but
one
question
to
ask
you
,
--
what
do
you
intend
to
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
going
to
ask
you
,
''
replied
the
baroness
with
a
beating
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
then
,
you
wish
to
ask
advice
of
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
I
do
wish
to
ask
your
advice
,
''
said
Madame
Danglars
with
anxious
*NL*
expectation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
if
you
wish
to
take
my
advice
,
''
said
the
young
man
coldly
,
``
I
*NL*
would
recommend
you
to
travel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
travel
!
''
she
murmured
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
;
as
M.
Danglars
says
,
you
are
rich
,
and
perfectly
free
.
In
*NL*
my
opinion
,
a
withdrawal
from
Paris
is
absolutely
necessary
after
the
*NL*
double
catastrophe
of
Mademoiselle
Danglars
'
broken
contract
and
M.
*NL*
Danglars
'
disappearance
.
The
world
will
think
you
abandoned
and
poor
,
*NL*
for
the
wife
of
a
bankrupt
would
never
be
forgiven
,
were
she
to
keep
up
*NL*
an
appearance
of
opulence
.
You
have
only
to
remain
in
Paris
for
about
a
*NL*
fortnight
,
telling
the
world
you
are
abandoned
,
and
relating
the
details
*NL*
of
this
desertion
to
your
best
friends
,
who
will
soon
spread
the
report
.
*NL*
Then
you
can
quit
your
house
,
leaving
your
jewels
and
giving
up
your
*NL*
jointure
,
and
every
one
's
mouth
will
be
filled
with
praises
of
your
*NL*
disinterestedness
.
They
will
know
you
are
deserted
,
and
think
you
also
*NL*
poor
,
for
I
alone
know
your
real
financial
position
,
and
am
quite
ready
*NL*
to
give
up
my
accounts
as
an
honest
partner
.
''
The
dread
with
which
the
*NL*
pale
and
motionless
baroness
listened
to
this
,
was
equalled
by
the
calm
*NL*
indifference
with
which
Debray
had
spoken
.
``
Deserted
?
''
she
repeated
;
*NL*
``
ah
,
yes
,
I
am
,
indeed
,
deserted
!
You
are
right
,
sir
,
and
no
one
can
*NL*
doubt
my
position
.
''
These
were
the
only
words
that
this
proud
and
*NL*
violently
enamoured
woman
could
utter
in
response
to
Debray
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
then
you
are
rich
,
--
very
rich
,
indeed
,
''
continued
Debray
,
taking
*NL*
out
some
papers
from
his
pocket-book
,
which
he
spread
upon
the
table
.
*NL*
Madame
Danglars
did
not
see
them
;
she
was
engaged
in
stilling
the
*NL*
beatings
of
her
heart
,
and
restraining
the
tears
which
were
ready
to
*NL*
gush
forth
.
At
length
a
sense
of
dignity
prevailed
,
and
if
she
did
not
*NL*
entirely
master
her
agitation
,
she
at
least
succeeded
in
preventing
the
*NL*
fall
of
a
single
tear
.
``
Madame
,
''
said
Debray
,
``
it
is
nearly
six
months
*NL*
since
we
have
been
associated
.
You
furnished
a
principal
of
100,000
*NL*
francs
.
Our
partnership
began
in
the
month
of
April
.
In
May
we
commenced
*NL*
operations
,
and
in
the
course
of
the
month
gained
450,000
francs
.
*NL*
In
June
the
profit
amounted
to
900,000
.
In
July
we
added
1,700,000
*NL*
francs
,
--
it
was
,
you
know
,
the
month
of
the
Spanish
bonds
.
In
August
we
*NL*
lost
300,000
francs
at
the
beginning
of
the
month
,
but
on
the
13th
we
*NL*
made
up
for
it
,
and
we
now
find
that
our
accounts
,
reckoning
from
the
*NL*
first
day
of
partnership
up
to
yesterday
,
when
I
closed
them
,
showed
*NL*
a
capital
of
2,400,000
francs
,
that
is
,
1,200,000
for
each
of
us
.
Now
,
*NL*
madame
,
''
said
Debray
,
delivering
up
his
accounts
in
the
methodical
*NL*
manner
of
a
stockbroker
,
``
there
are
still
80,000
francs
,
the
interest
of
*NL*
this
money
,
in
my
hands
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
''
said
the
baroness
,
``
I
thought
you
never
put
the
money
out
to
*NL*
interest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excuse
me
,
madame
,
''
said
Debray
coldly
,
``
I
had
your
permission
to
do
*NL*
so
,
and
I
have
made
use
of
it
.
There
are
,
then
,
40,000
francs
for
your
*NL*
share
,
besides
the
100,000
you
furnished
me
to
begin
with
,
making
in
all
*NL*
1,340,000
francs
for
your
portion
.
Now
,
madame
,
I
took
the
precaution
of
*NL*
drawing
out
your
money
the
day
before
yesterday
;
it
is
not
long
ago
,
you
*NL*
see
,
and
I
was
in
continual
expectation
of
being
called
on
to
deliver
up
*NL*
my
accounts
.
There
is
your
money
,
--
half
in
bank-notes
,
the
other
half
*NL*
in
checks
payable
to
bearer
.
I
say
there
,
for
as
I
did
not
consider
*NL*
my
house
safe
enough
,
or
lawyers
sufficiently
discreet
,
and
as
landed
*NL*
property
carries
evidence
with
it
,
and
moreover
since
you
have
no
right
*NL*
to
possess
anything
independent
of
your
husband
,
I
have
kept
this
sum
,
*NL*
now
your
whole
fortune
,
in
a
chest
concealed
under
that
closet
,
and
for
*NL*
greater
security
I
myself
concealed
it
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
madame
,
''
continued
Debray
,
first
opening
the
closet
,
then
*NL*
the
chest
;
--
``
now
,
madame
,
here
are
800
notes
of
1,000
.
francs
each
,
*NL*
resembling
,
as
you
see
,
a
large
book
bound
in
iron
;
to
this
I
add
a
*NL*
certificate
in
the
funds
of
25,000
.
francs
;
then
,
for
the
odd
cash
,
*NL*
making
I
think
about
110,000
.
francs
,
here
is
a
check
upon
my
banker
,
*NL*
who
,
not
being
M.
Danglars
,
will
pay
you
the
amount
,
you
may
rest
*NL*
assured
.
''
Madame
Danglars
mechanically
took
the
check
,
the
bond
,
and
the
*NL*
heap
of
bank-notes
.
This
enormous
fortune
made
no
great
appearance
on
*NL*
the
table
.
Madame
Danglars
,
with
tearless
eyes
,
but
with
her
breast
*NL*
heaving
with
concealed
emotion
,
placed
the
bank-notes
in
her
bag
,
put
*NL*
the
certificate
and
check
into
her
pocket-book
,
and
then
,
standing
pale
*NL*
and
mute
,
awaited
one
kind
word
of
consolation
.
But
she
waited
in
vain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
madame
,
''
said
Debray
,
``
you
have
a
splendid
fortune
,
an
income
of
*NL*
about
60,000
livres
a
year
,
which
is
enormous
for
a
woman
who
can
not
*NL*
keep
an
establishment
here
for
a
year
,
at
least
.
You
will
be
able
*NL*
to
indulge
all
your
fancies
;
besides
,
should
you
find
your
income
*NL*
insufficient
,
you
can
,
for
the
sake
of
the
past
,
madame
,
make
use
of
*NL*
mine
;
and
I
am
ready
to
offer
you
all
I
possess
,
on
loan
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
sir
--
thank
you
,
''
replied
the
baroness
;
``
you
forget
that
*NL*
what
you
have
just
paid
me
is
much
more
than
a
poor
woman
requires
,
who
*NL*
intends
for
some
time
,
at
least
,
to
retire
from
the
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Debray
was
,
for
a
moment
,
surprised
,
but
immediately
recovering
himself
,
*NL*
he
bowed
with
an
air
which
seemed
to
say
,
``
As
you
please
,
madame
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Danglars
had
until
then
,
perhaps
,
hoped
for
something
;
but
when
*NL*
she
saw
the
careless
bow
of
Debray
,
and
the
glance
by
which
it
was
*NL*
accompanied
,
together
with
his
significant
silence
,
she
raised
her
head
,
*NL*
and
without
passion
or
violence
or
even
hesitation
,
ran
down-stairs
,
*NL*
disdaining
to
address
a
last
farewell
to
one
who
could
thus
part
from
*NL*
her
.
``
Bah
,
''
said
Debray
,
when
she
had
left
,
``
these
are
fine
projects
!
*NL*
She
will
remain
at
home
,
read
novels
,
and
speculate
at
cards
,
since
she
*NL*
can
no
longer
do
so
on
the
Bourse
.
''
Then
taking
up
his
account
book
,
he
*NL*
cancelled
with
the
greatest
care
all
the
entries
of
the
amounts
he
had
*NL*
just
paid
away
.
``
I
have
1,060,000
francs
remaining
,
''
he
said
.
``
What
a
*NL*
pity
Mademoiselle
de
Villefort
is
dead
!
She
suited
me
in
every
respect
,
*NL*
and
I
would
have
married
her
.
''
And
he
calmly
waited
until
the
twenty
*NL*
minutes
had
elapsed
after
Madame
Danglars
'
departure
before
he
left
the
*NL*
house
.
During
this
time
he
occupied
himself
in
making
figures
,
with
his
*NL*
watch
by
his
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
Asmodeus
--
that
diabolical
personage
,
who
would
have
been
created
by
*NL*
every
fertile
imagination
if
Le
Sage
had
not
acquired
the
priority
in
*NL*
his
great
masterpiece
--
would
have
enjoyed
a
singular
spectacle
,
if
*NL*
he
had
lifted
up
the
roof
of
the
little
house
in
the
Rue
*NL*
Saint-Germain-des-Pres
,
while
Debray
was
casting
up
his
figures
.
Above
*NL*
the
room
in
which
Debray
had
been
dividing
two
millions
and
a
half
with
*NL*
Madame
Danglars
was
another
,
inhabited
by
persons
who
have
played
too
*NL*
prominent
a
part
in
the
incidents
we
have
related
for
their
appearance
*NL*
not
to
create
some
interest
.
Mercedes
and
Albert
were
in
that
room
.
*NL*
Mercedes
was
much
changed
within
the
last
few
days
;
not
that
even
in
her
*NL*
days
of
fortune
she
had
ever
dressed
with
the
magnificent
display
which
*NL*
makes
us
no
longer
able
to
recognize
a
woman
when
she
appears
in
a
*NL*
plain
and
simple
attire
;
nor
indeed
,
had
she
fallen
into
that
state
of
*NL*
depression
where
it
is
impossible
to
conceal
the
garb
of
misery
;
no
,
*NL*
the
change
in
Mercedes
was
that
her
eye
no
longer
sparkled
,
her
lips
*NL*
no
longer
smiled
,
and
there
was
now
a
hesitation
in
uttering
the
words
*NL*
which
formerly
sprang
so
fluently
from
her
ready
wit
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
poverty
which
had
broken
her
spirit
;
it
was
not
a
want
*NL*
of
courage
which
rendered
her
poverty
burdensome
.
Mercedes
,
although
*NL*
deposed
from
the
exalted
position
she
had
occupied
,
lost
in
the
sphere
*NL*
she
had
now
chosen
,
like
a
person
passing
from
a
room
splendidly
lighted
*NL*
into
utter
darkness
,
appeared
like
a
queen
,
fallen
from
her
palace
to
*NL*
a
hovel
,
and
who
,
reduced
to
strict
necessity
,
could
neither
become
*NL*
reconciled
to
the
earthen
vessels
she
was
herself
forced
to
place
*NL*
upon
the
table
,
nor
to
the
humble
pallet
which
had
become
her
bed
.
The
*NL*
beautiful
Catalane
and
noble
countess
had
lost
both
her
proud
glance
and
*NL*
charming
smile
,
because
she
saw
nothing
but
misery
around
her
;
the
walls
*NL*
were
hung
with
one
of
the
gray
papers
which
economical
landlords
choose
*NL*
as
not
likely
to
show
the
dirt
;
the
floor
was
uncarpeted
;
the
furniture
*NL*
attracted
the
attention
to
the
poor
attempt
at
luxury
;
indeed
,
*NL*
everything
offended
eyes
accustomed
to
refinement
and
elegance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Morcerf
had
lived
there
since
leaving
her
house
;
the
continual
*NL*
silence
of
the
spot
oppressed
her
;
still
,
seeing
that
Albert
continually
*NL*
watched
her
countenance
to
judge
the
state
of
her
feelings
,
she
*NL*
constrained
herself
to
assume
a
monotonous
smile
of
the
lips
alone
,
*NL*
which
,
contrasted
with
the
sweet
and
beaming
expression
that
usually
*NL*
shone
from
her
eyes
,
seemed
like
``
moonlight
on
a
statue
,
''
--
yielding
*NL*
light
without
warmth
.
Albert
,
too
,
was
ill
at
ease
;
the
remains
of
*NL*
luxury
prevented
him
from
sinking
into
his
actual
position
.
If
he
wished
*NL*
to
go
out
without
gloves
,
his
hands
appeared
too
white
;
if
he
wished
to
*NL*
walk
through
the
town
,
his
boots
seemed
too
highly
polished
.
Yet
these
*NL*
two
noble
and
intelligent
creatures
,
united
by
the
indissoluble
ties
*NL*
of
maternal
and
filial
love
,
had
succeeded
in
tacitly
understanding
one
*NL*
another
,
and
economizing
their
stores
,
and
Albert
had
been
able
to
tell
*NL*
his
mother
without
extorting
a
change
of
countenance
,
--
``
Mother
,
we
have
*NL*
no
more
money
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mercedes
had
never
known
misery
;
she
had
often
,
in
her
youth
,
spoken
of
*NL*
poverty
,
but
between
want
and
necessity
,
those
synonymous
words
,
there
*NL*
is
a
wide
difference
.
Amongst
the
Catalans
,
Mercedes
wished
for
a
*NL*
thousand
things
,
but
still
she
never
really
wanted
any
.
So
long
as
the
*NL*
nets
were
good
,
they
caught
fish
;
and
so
long
as
they
sold
their
fish
,
*NL*
they
were
able
to
buy
twine
for
new
nets
.
And
then
,
shut
out
from
*NL*
friendship
,
having
but
one
affection
,
which
could
not
be
mixed
up
with
*NL*
her
ordinary
pursuits
,
she
thought
of
herself
--
of
no
one
but
herself
.
*NL*
Upon
the
little
she
earned
she
lived
as
well
as
she
could
;
now
there
*NL*
were
two
to
be
supported
,
and
nothing
to
live
upon
.
*NL*
*NL*
Winter
approached
.
Mercedes
had
no
fire
in
that
cold
and
naked
*NL*
room
--
she
,
who
was
accustomed
to
stoves
which
heated
the
house
from
*NL*
the
hall
to
the
boudoir
;
she
had
not
even
one
little
flower
--
she
whose
*NL*
apartment
had
been
a
conservatory
of
costly
exotics
.
But
she
had
her
*NL*
son
.
Hitherto
the
excitement
of
fulfilling
a
duty
had
sustained
them
.
*NL*
Excitement
,
like
enthusiasm
,
sometimes
renders
us
unconscious
to
the
*NL*
things
of
earth
.
But
the
excitement
had
calmed
down
,
and
they
felt
*NL*
themselves
obliged
to
descend
from
dreams
to
reality
;
after
having
*NL*
exhausted
the
ideal
,
they
found
they
must
talk
of
the
actual
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mother
,
''
exclaimed
Albert
,
just
as
Madame
Danglars
was
descending
the
*NL*
stairs
,
``
let
us
reckon
our
riches
,
if
you
please
;
I
want
capital
to
*NL*
build
my
plans
upon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Capital
--
nothing
!
''
replied
Mercedes
with
a
mournful
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
mother
,
--
capital
3,000
francs
.
And
I
have
an
idea
of
our
leading
a
*NL*
delightful
life
upon
this
3,000
francs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Child
!
''
sighed
Mercedes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas
,
dear
mother
,
''
said
the
young
man
,
``
I
have
unhappily
spent
too
*NL*
much
of
your
money
not
to
know
the
value
of
it
.
These
3,000
francs
*NL*
are
enormous
,
and
I
intend
building
upon
this
foundation
a
miraculous
*NL*
certainty
for
the
future
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
say
this
,
my
dear
boy
;
but
do
you
think
we
ought
to
accept
these
*NL*
3,000
francs
?
''
said
Mercedes
,
coloring
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
so
,
''
answered
Albert
in
a
firm
tone
.
``
We
will
accept
them
the
*NL*
more
readily
,
since
we
have
them
not
here
;
you
know
they
are
buried
in
*NL*
the
garden
of
the
little
house
in
the
Allees
de
Meillan
,
at
Marseilles
.
*NL*
With
200
francs
we
can
reach
Marseilles
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
200
francs
?
--
are
you
sure
,
Albert
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
as
for
that
,
I
have
made
inquiries
respecting
the
diligences
and
*NL*
steamboats
,
and
my
calculations
are
made
.
You
will
take
your
place
*NL*
in
the
coupe
to
Chalons

You

mother
,
I
treat
you
handsomely

Albert
then
took
a
pen
,
and
wrote
:

added
Albert

smiling
.

*NL*
*NL*
``

A

*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
Any

*NL*
*NL*

How
fortunate
that

ornaments
were
worth
more
than
the

Still
the

of

superfluities
!

think

are
rich

And
Albert
took
out
of
a
little
pocket-book
with
golden
clasps
,
a
*NL*
remnant
of
his
old
fancies
,
or
perhaps
a
tender
souvenir
from
one
of

the
mysterious
and
veiled
ladies
who
used
to
knock
at
his
little

door

Albert
took
out
of
this
pocket-book
a
note
of
1,000
francs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

asked
Mercedes

*NL*

And
*NL*
Albert
,
rising
,
kissed
his
mother
on
both
cheeks
,
then
stood
looking
at
*NL*
her
.
``
You
can
not
imagine

how
beautiful
I

you

said
the

young

impressed
with
a
profound
feeling

filial
love

``

said
Mercedes
,
endeavoring
in
vain
to
restrain
a
tear

which
glistened
in
the
corner
of
her
eye

``
Indeed

you
only
wanted

misfortune

Mercedes
sighed
.
*NL*
``
Well

yesterday
engaged
myself

added
the
young
man

lowering
his
eyes
with
a
certain
feeling

shame
,
for
even
he
was
unconscious
of
the
sublimity
of
his
self

*NL*
abasement

I
thought
my
body
was
my
own

it

yesterday
took

he
added
,
attempting
to
smile
;
``
I
fetched
2,000

The

shuddering

sum

will
be
paid

*NL*
*NL*
Mercedes
raised
her
eyes
to
heaven
with
an
expression
it
would
be
*NL*
impossible
to
describe
,
and
tears
,
which
had
hitherto
been
restrained
,
*NL*
now
yielded
to
her
emotion

ran
down
her
cheeks

felt
half
*NL*
so
strong
an
inclination
to
live
as
I
do
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Merciful
heavens
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Besides
,
mother
,
why
should
you
make
up
your
mind
that
I
am
to
be
*NL*
killed
?
Has
Lamoriciere
,
that
Ney
of
the
South
,
been
killed
?
Has
*NL*
Changarnier
been
killed
?
Has
Bedeau
been
killed
?
Has
Morrel
,
whom
we
*NL*
know
,
been
killed
?
Think
of
your
joy
,
mother
,
when
you
see
me
return
*NL*
with
an
embroidered
uniform
!
I
declare
,
I
expect
to
look
magnificent
*NL*
in
it
,
and
chose
that
regiment
only
from
vanity
.
''
Mercedes
sighed
while
*NL*
endeavoring
to
smile
;
the
devoted
mother
felt
that
she
ought
not
to
*NL*
allow
the
whole
weight
of
the
sacrifice
to
fall
upon
her
son
.
``
Well
,
*NL*
now
you
understand
,
mother
!
''
continued
Albert
;
``
here
are
more
than
4,000
*NL*
francs
settled
on
you
;
upon
these
you
can
live
at
least
two
years
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
so
?
''
said
Mercedes
.
These
words
were
uttered
in
so
*NL*
mournful
a
tone
that
their
real
meaning
did
not
escape
Albert
;
he
felt
*NL*
his
heart
beat
,
and
taking
his
mother
's
hand
within
his
own
he
said
,
*NL*
tenderly
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
you
will
live
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
live
!
--
then
you
will
not
leave
me
,
Albert
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mother
,
I
must
go
,
''
said
Albert
in
a
firm
,
calm
voice
;
``
you
love
me
*NL*
too
well
to
wish
me
to
remain
useless
and
idle
with
you
;
besides
,
I
have
*NL*
signed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
obey
your
own
wish
and
the
will
of
heaven
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
my
own
wish
,
mother
,
but
reason
--
necessity
.
Are
we
not
two
*NL*
despairing
creatures
?
What
is
life
to
you
?
--
Nothing
.
What
is
life
to
*NL*
me
?
--
Very
little
without
you
,
mother
;
for
believe
me
,
but
for
you
I
*NL*
should
have
ceased
to
live
on
the
day
I
doubted
my
father
and
renounced
*NL*
his
name
.
Well
,
I
will
live
,
if
you
promise
me
still
to
hope
;
and
if
*NL*
you
grant
me
the
care
of
your
future
prospects
,
you
will
redouble
my
*NL*
strength
.
Then
I
will
go
to
the
governor
of
Algeria
;
he
has
a
royal
*NL*
heart
,
and
is
essentially
a
soldier
;
I
will
tell
him
my
gloomy
story
.
*NL*
I
will
beg
him
to
turn
his
eyes
now

then
towards
me
,
and
if
he
*NL*
keep
his
word
and
interest
himself
for
me
,
in
six
months
I
shall
be
an
*NL*
officer
,
or
dead
.
If
I
am
an
officer
,
your
fortune
is
certain
,
for
I
*NL*
shall
have
money
enough
for
both
,
and
,
moreover
,
a
name
we
shall
both
*NL*
be
proud
of
,
since
it
will
be
our
own
.
If
I
am
killed
--
well
then
mother
,
*NL*
you
can
also
die
,
and
there
will
be
an
end
of
our
misfortunes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
well
,
''
replied
Mercedes
,
with
her
eloquent
glance
;
``
you
are
*NL*
right
,
my
love

let
us
prove
to
those
who
are
watching
our
actions
that

we
are
worthy
of
compassion

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
let
us
not
yield
to
gloomy
apprehensions

said
the
young
man
;
``
I
*NL*
assure
you
we
are

rather
we
shall
be

very
happy

You
are
a

once
full
of
spirit

resignation

I
have
become
simple
in
my
tastes

am
without

Once

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

strive

for
you

to
live

to
be
happy

Albert

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
so
our
division
is
made

mother
,
''
said
the
young
man
,
affecting
*NL*
ease
of
mind
.
``
We
can
now
part

come
,
I
shall
engage
your
passage
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you

my

boy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
stay
here
for
a
few
days
longer
;
we
must
accustom
ourselves
to
*NL*
parting

I
want
recommendations
and
some
information
relative
to
Africa
.
*NL*
I
will
join
you
again
at
Marseilles
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
be
it
so
--
let
us
part
,
''
said
Mercedes
,
folding
around
her
*NL*
shoulders
the
only
shawl
she
had
taken
away
,
and
which
accidentally
*NL*
happened
to
be
a
valuable
black
cashmere
.
Albert
gathered
up
his
papers
*NL*
hastily
,
rang
the
bell
to
pay
the
thirty
francs
he
owed
to
the
landlord
,
*NL*
and
offering
his
arm
to
his
mother
,
they
descended
the
stairs
.
Some
one
*NL*
was
walking
down
before
them
,
and
this
person
,
hearing
the
rustling
of
a
*NL*
silk
dress
,
turned
around
.
``
Debray
!
''
muttered
Albert
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
,
Morcerf
?
''
replied
the
secretary
,
resting
on
the
stairs
.
Curiosity
*NL*
had
vanquished
the
desire
of
preserving
his
incognito
,
and
he
was
*NL*
recognized
.
It
was
,
indeed
,
strange
in
this
unknown
spot
to
find
the
*NL*
young
man
whose
misfortunes
had
made
so
much
noise
in
Paris
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Morcerf
!
''
repeated
Debray
.
Then
noticing
in
the
dim
light
the
still
*NL*
youthful
and
veiled
figure
of
Madame
de
Morcerf
:
--
``
Pardon
me
,
''
he
added
*NL*
with
a
smile
,
``
I
leave
you
,
Albert
.
''
Albert
understood
his
thoughts
.
*NL*
``
Mother
,
''
he
said
,
turning
towards
Mercedes
,
``
this
is
M.
Debray
,
*NL*
secretary
of
the
minister
for
the
interior
,
once
a
friend
of
mine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
once
?
''
stammered
Debray
;
``
what
do
you
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
so
,
M.
Debray
,
because
I
have
no
friends
now
,
and
I
ought
not
*NL*
to
have
any
.
I
thank
you
for
having
recognized
me
,
sir
.
''
Debray
stepped
*NL*
forward
,
and
cordially
pressed
the
hand
of
his
interlocutor
.
``
Believe
*NL*
me
,
dear
Albert
,
''
he
said
,
with
all
the
emotion
he
was
capable
of
*NL*
feeling
,
--
``
believe
me
,
I
feel
deeply
for
your
misfortunes
,
and
if
in
any
*NL*
way
I
can
serve
you
,
I
am
yours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
sir
,
''
said
Albert
,
smiling
.
``
In
the
midst
of
our
*NL*
misfortunes
,
we
are
still
rich
enough
not
to
require
assistance
from
any
*NL*
one
.
We
are
leaving
Paris
,
and
when
our
journey
is
paid
,
we
shall
have
*NL*
5,000
francs
left
.
''
The
blood
mounted
to
the
temples
of
Debray
,
who
held
*NL*
a
million
in
his
pocket-book
,
and
unimaginative
as
he
was
he
could
not
*NL*
help
reflecting
that
the
same
house
had
contained
two
women
,
one
of
*NL*
whom
,
justly
dishonored
,
had
left
it
poor
with
1,500,000
.
francs
under
*NL*
her
cloak
,
while
the
other
,
unjustly
stricken
,
but
sublime
in
her
*NL*
misfortune
,
was
yet
rich
with
a
few
deniers
.
This
parallel
disturbed
his
*NL*
usual
politeness
,
the
philosophy
he
witnessed
appalled
him
,
he
muttered
*NL*
a
few
words
of
general
civility
and
ran
down-stairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
day
the
minister
's
clerks
and
the
subordinates
had
a
great
deal
to
*NL*
put
up
with
from
his
ill-humor
.
But
that
same
night
,
he
found
himself
*NL*
the
possessor
of
a
fine
house
,
situated
on
the
Boulevard
de
la
*NL*
Madeleine
,
and
an
income
of
50,000
livres
.
The
next
day
,
just
as
Debray
*NL*
was
signing
the
deed
,
that
is
about
five
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
,
*NL*
Madame
de
Morcerf
,
after
having
affectionately
embraced
her
son
,
entered
*NL*
the
coupe
of
the
diligence
,
which
closed
upon
her
.
A
man
was
hidden
in
*NL*
Lafitte
's
banking-house
,
behind
one
of
the
little
arched
windows
which
*NL*
are
placed
above
each
desk
;
he
saw
Mercedes
enter
the
diligence
,
and
he
*NL*
also
saw
Albert
withdraw
.
Then
he
passed
his
hand
across
his
forehead
,
*NL*
which
was
clouded
with
doubt
.
``
Alas
,
''
he
exclaimed
,
``
how
can
I
restore
*NL*
the
happiness
I
have
taken
away
from
these
poor
innocent
creatures
?
God
*NL*
help
me
!

Chapter
107
.
The
Lions
'
Den
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
division
of
La
Force
,
in
which
the
most
dangerous
and
desperate
*NL*
prisoners
are
confined
,
is
called
the
court
of
Saint-Bernard
.
The
*NL*
prisoners
,
in
their
expressive
language
,
have
named
it
the
``
Lions
'
Den
,
''
*NL*
probably
because
the
captives
possess
teeth
which
frequently
gnaw
the
*NL*
bars
,
and
sometimes
the
keepers
also
.
It
is
a
prison
within
a
prison
;
*NL*
the
walls
are
double
the
thickness
of
the
rest
.
The
gratings
are
every
*NL*
day
carefully
examined
by
jailers
,
whose
herculean
proportions
and
cold
*NL*
pitiless
expression
prove
them
to
have
been
chosen
to
reign
over
their
*NL*
subjects
for
their
superior
activity
and
intelligence
.
The
court-yard
of
*NL*
this
quarter
is
enclosed
by
enormous
walls
,
over
which
the
sun
glances
*NL*
obliquely
,
when
it
deigns
to
penetrate
into
this
gulf
of
moral
and
*NL*
physical
deformity
.
On
this
paved
yard
are
to
be
seen
,
--
pacing
to
and
*NL*
fro
from
morning
till
night
,
pale
,
careworn
,
and
haggard
,
like
so
*NL*
many
shadows
,
--
the
men
whom
justice
holds
beneath
the
steel
she
is
*NL*
sharpening
.
There
,
crouched
against
the
side
of
the
wall
which
attracts
*NL*
and
retains
the
most
heat
,
they
may
be
seen
sometimes
talking
to
one
*NL*
another
,
but
more
frequently
alone
,
watching
the
door
,
which
sometimes
*NL*
opens
to
call
forth
one
from
the
gloomy
assemblage
,
or
to
throw
in
*NL*
another
outcast
from
society
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
court
of
Saint-Bernard
has
its
own
particular
apartment
for
the
*NL*
reception
of
guests
;
it
is
a
long
rectangle
,
divided
by
two
upright
*NL*
gratings
placed
at
a
distance
of
three
feet
from
one
another
to
prevent
*NL*
a
visitor
from
shaking
hands
with
or
passing
anything
to
the
prisoners
.
*NL*
It
is
a
wretched
,
damp
,
nay
,
even
horrible
spot
,
more
especially
when
we
*NL*
consider
the
agonizing
conferences
which
have
taken
place
between
those
*NL*
iron
bars
.
And
yet
,
frightful
though
this
spot
may
be
,
it
is
looked
upon
*NL*
as
a
kind
of
paradise
by
the
men
whose
days
are
numbered
;
it
is
so
rare
*NL*
for
them
to
leave
the
Lions
'
Den
for
any
other
place
than
the
barrier
*NL*
Saint-Jacques
or
the
galleys
!
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
court
which
we
have
attempted
to
describe
,
and
from
which
a
damp
*NL*
vapor
was
rising
,
a
young
man
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
,
who
had
*NL*
excited
much
curiosity
among
the
inhabitants
of
the
``
Den
,
''
might
be
seen
*NL*
walking
.
The
cut
of
his
clothes
would
have
made
him
pass
for
an
elegant
*NL*
man
,
if
those
clothes
had
not
been
torn
to
shreds
;
still
they
did
not
*NL*
show
signs
of
wear
,
and
the
fine
cloth
,
beneath
the
careful
hands
of
*NL*
the
prisoner
,
soon
recovered
its
gloss
in
the
parts
which
were
still
*NL*
perfect
,
for
the
wearer
tried
his
best
to
make
it
assume
the
appearance
*NL*
of
a
new
coat
.
He
bestowed
the
same
attention
upon
the
cambric
front
of
*NL*
a
shirt
,
which
had
considerably
changed
in
color
since
his
entrance
into
*NL*
the
prison
,
and
he
polished
his
varnished
boots
with
the
corner
of
a
*NL*
handkerchief
embroidered
with
initials
surmounted
by
a
coronet
.
Some
*NL*
of
the
inmates
of
the
``
Lions
'
Den
''
were
watching
the
operations
of
*NL*
the
prisoner
's
toilet
with
considerable
interest
.
``
See
,
the
prince
is
*NL*
pluming
himself
,
''
said
one
of
the
thieves
.
``
He
's
a
fine
looking
fellow
,
''
*NL*
said
another
;
``
if
he
had
only
a
comb
and
hair-grease
,
he
'd
take
the
*NL*
shine
off
the
gentlemen
in
white
kids
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
His
coat
looks
almost
new
,
and
his
boots
shine
like
a
nigger
's
face
.
*NL*
It
's
pleasant
to
have
such
well-dressed
comrades
;
but
did
n't
those
*NL*
gendarmes
behave
shameful
?
--
must
'
a
been
jealous
,
to
tear
such
clothes
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
looks
like
a
big-bug
,
''
said
another
;
``
dresses
in
fine
style
.
And
,
*NL*
then
,
to
be
here
so
young
!
Oh
,
what
larks
!
''
Meanwhile
the
object
of
*NL*
this
hideous
admiration
approached
the
wicket
,
against
which
one
of
the
*NL*
keepers
was
leaning
.
``
Come
,
sir
,
''
he
said
,
``
lend
me
twenty
francs
;
you
*NL*
will
soon
be
paid
;
you
run
no
risks
with
me
.
Remember
,
I
have
relations
*NL*
who
possess
more
millions
than
you
have
deniers
.
Come
,
I
beseech
*NL*
you
,
lend
me
twenty
francs
,
so
that
I
may
buy
a
dressing-gown
;
it
is
*NL*
intolerable
always
to
be
in
a
coat
and
boots
!
And
what
a
coat
,
sir
,
for
*NL*
a
prince
of
the
Cavalcanti
!
''
The
keeper
turned
his
back
,
and
shrugged
*NL*
his
shoulders
;
he
did
not
even
laugh
at
what
would
have
caused
any
one
*NL*
else
to
do
so
;
he
had
heard
so
many
utter
the
same
things
,
--
indeed
,
he
*NL*
heard
nothing
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
''
said
Andrea
,
``
you
are
a
man
void
of
compassion
;
I
'll
have
you
*NL*
turned
out
.
''
This
made
the
keeper
turn
around
,
and
he
burst
into
a
loud
*NL*
laugh
.
The
prisoners
then
approached
and
formed
a
circle
.
``
I
tell
you
*NL*
that
with
that
wretched
sum
,
''
continued
Andrea
,
``
I
could
obtain
a
*NL*
coat
,
and
a
room
in
which
to
receive
the
illustrious
visitor
I
am
daily
*NL*
expecting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
--
of
course
,
''
said
the
prisoners
;
--
``
any
one
can
see
he
's
a
*NL*
gentleman
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
lend
him
the
twenty
francs
,
''
said
the
keeper
,
leaning
on
*NL*
the
other
shoulder
;
``
surely
you
will
not
refuse
a
comrade
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
no
comrade
of
these
people
,
''
said
the
young
man
,
proudly
,
``
you
*NL*
have
no
right
to
insult
me
thus
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
thieves
looked
at
one
another
with
low
murmurs
,
and
a
storm
gathered
*NL*
over
the
head
of
the
aristocratic
prisoner
,
raised
less
by
his
own
*NL*
words
than
by
the
manner
of
the
keeper
.
The
latter
,
sure
of
quelling
*NL*
the
tempest
when
the
waves
became
too
violent
,
allowed
them
to
rise
to
*NL*
a
certain
pitch
that
he
might
be
revenged
on
the
importunate
Andrea
,
*NL*
and
besides
it
would
afford
him
some
recreation
during
the
long
day
.
The
*NL*
thieves
had
already
approached
Andrea
,
some
screaming
,
``
La
savate
--
La
*NL*
savate
!
''
-LSB-
*
-RSB-
a
cruel
operation
,
which
consists
in
cuffing
a
comrade
who
*NL*
may
have
fallen
into
disgrace
,
not
with
an
old
shoe
,
but
with
an
*NL*
iron-heeled
one
.
Others
proposed
the
``
anguille
,
''
another
kind
of
*NL*
recreation
,
in
which
a
handkerchief
is
filled
with
sand
,
pebbles
,
and
*NL*
two-sous
pieces
,
when
they
have
them
,
which
the
wretches
beat
like
a
*NL*
flail
over
the
head
and
shoulders
of
the
unhappy
sufferer
.
``
Let
us
*NL*
horsewhip
the
fine
gentleman
!
''
said
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
Savate
:
an
old
shoe
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Andrea
,
turning
towards
them
,
winked
his
eyes
,
rolled
his
tongue
*NL*
around
his
cheeks
,
and
smacked
his
lips
in
a
manner
equivalent
to
a
*NL*
hundred
words
among
the
bandits
when
forced
to
be
silent
.
It
was
a
*NL*
Masonic
sign
Caderousse
had
taught
him
.
He
was
immediately
recognized
as
*NL*
one
of
them
;
the
handkerchief
was
thrown
down
,
and
the
iron-heeled
shoe
*NL*
replaced
on
the
foot
of
the
wretch
to
whom
it
belonged
.
Some
voices
were
*NL*
heard
to
say
that
the
gentleman
was
right
;
that
he
intended
to
be
*NL*
civil
,
in
his
way
,
and
that
they
would
set
the
example
of
liberty
of
*NL*
conscience
,
--
and
the
mob
retired
.
The
keeper
was
so
stupefied
at
this
*NL*
scene
that
he
took
Andrea
by
the
hands
and
began
examining
his
person
,
*NL*
attributing
the
sudden
submission
of
the
inmates
of
the
Lions
'
Den
*NL*
to
something
more
substantial
than
mere
fascination
.
Andrea
made
no
*NL*
resistance
,
although
he
protested
against
it
.
Suddenly
a
voice
was
heard
*NL*
at
the
wicket
.
``
Benedetto
!
''
exclaimed
an
inspector
.
The
keeper
relaxed
*NL*
his
hold
.
``
I
am
called
,
''
said
Andrea
.
``
To
the
visitors
'
room
!
''
said
the
*NL*
same
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
some
one
pays
me
a
visit
.
Ah
,
my
dear
sir
,
you
will
see
whether
*NL*
a
Cavalcanti
is
to
be
treated
like
a
common
person
!
''
And
Andrea
,
gliding
*NL*
through
the
court
like
a
black
shadow
,
rushed
out
through
the
wicket
,
*NL*
leaving
his
comrades
,
and
even
the
keeper
,
lost
in
wonder
.
Certainly
*NL*
a
call
to
the
visitors
'
room
had
scarcely
astonished
Andrea
less
than
*NL*
themselves
,
for
the
wily
youth
,
instead
of
making
use
of
his
privilege
*NL*
of
waiting
to
be
claimed
on
his
entry
into
La
Force
,
had
maintained
*NL*
a
rigid
silence
.
``
Everything
,
''
he
said
,
``
proves
me
to
be
under
the
*NL*
protection
of
some
powerful
person
,
--
this
sudden
fortune
,
the
facility
*NL*
with
which
I
have
overcome
all
obstacles
,
an
unexpected
family
and
an
*NL*
illustrious
name
awarded
to
me
,
gold
showered
down
upon
me
,
and
the
most
*NL*
splendid
alliances
about
to
be
entered
into
.
An
unhappy
lapse
of
fortune
*NL*
and
the
absence
of
my
protector
have
cast
me
down
,
certainly
,
but
*NL*
not
forever
.
The
hand
which
has
retreated
for
a
while
will
be
again
*NL*
stretched
forth
to
save
me
at
the
very
moment
when
I
shall
think
myself
*NL*
sinking
into
the
abyss
.
Why
should
I
risk
an
imprudent
step
?
It
might
*NL*
alienate
my
protector
.
He
has
two
means
of
extricating
me
from
this
*NL*
dilemma
,
--
the
one
by
a
mysterious
escape
,
managed
through
bribery
;
the
*NL*
other
by
buying
off
my
judges
with
gold
.
I
will
say
and
do
nothing
until
*NL*
I
am
convinced
that
he
has
quite
abandoned
me
,
and
then
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
Andrea
had
formed
a
plan
which
was
tolerably
clever
.
The
unfortunate
*NL*
youth
was
intrepid
in
the
attack
,
and
rude
in
the
defence
.
He
had
borne
*NL*
with
the
public
prison
,
and
with
privations
of
all
sorts
;
still
,
by
*NL*
degrees
nature
,
or
rather
custom
,
had
prevailed
,
and
he
suffered
from
*NL*
being
naked
,
dirty
,
and
hungry
.
It
was
at
this
moment
of
discomfort
that
*NL*
the
inspector
's
voice
called
him
to
the
visiting-room
.
Andrea
felt
his
*NL*
heart
leap
with
joy
.
It
was
too
soon
for
a
visit
from
the
examining
*NL*
magistrate
,
and
too
late
for
one
from
the
director
of
the
prison
,
or
the
*NL*
doctor
;
it
must
,
then
,
be
the
visitor
he
hoped
for
.
Behind
the
grating
*NL*
of
the
room
into
which
Andrea
had
been
led
,
he
saw
,
while
his
eyes
*NL*
dilated
with
surprise
,
the
dark
and
intelligent
face
of
M.
Bertuccio
,
*NL*
who
was
also
gazing
with
sad
astonishment
upon
the
iron
bars
,
the
bolted
*NL*
doors
,
and
the
shadow
which
moved
behind
the
other
grating
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
said
Andrea
,
deeply
affected
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
morning
,
Benedetto
,
''
said
Bertuccio
,
with
his
deep
,
hollow
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
--
you
?
''
said
the
young
man
,
looking
fearfully
around
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
not
recognize
me
,
unhappy
child
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Silence
,
--
be
silent
!
''
said
Andrea
,
who
knew
the
delicate
sense
of
*NL*
hearing
possessed
by
the
walls
;
``
for
heaven
's
sake
,
do
not
speak
so
*NL*
loud
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
wish
to
speak
with
me
alone
,
do
you
not
?
''
said
Bertuccio
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
well
.
''
And
Bertuccio
,
feeling
in
his
pocket
,
signed
to
a
keeper
*NL*
whom
he
saw
through
the
window
of
the
wicket
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Read
?
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
that
?
''
asked
Andrea
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
order
to
conduct
you
to
a
room
,
and
to
leave
you
there
to
talk
to
*NL*
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
cried
Andrea
,
leaping
with
joy
.
Then
he
mentally
added
,
--
``
Still
my
*NL*
unknown
protector
!
I
am
not
forgotten
.
They
wish
for
secrecy
,
since
we
*NL*
are
to
converse
in
a
private
room
.
I
understand
,
Bertuccio
has
been
sent
*NL*
by
my
protector
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
keeper
spoke
for
a
moment
with
an
official
,
then
opened
the
iron
*NL*
gates
and
conducted
Andrea
to
a
room
on
the
first
floor
.
The
room
was
*NL*
whitewashed
,
as
is
the
custom
in
prisons
,
but
it
looked
quite
brilliant
*NL*
to
a
prisoner
,
though
a
stove
,
a
bed
,
a
chair
,
and
a
table
formed
the
*NL*
whole
of
its
sumptuous
furniture
.
Bertuccio
sat
down
upon
the
chair
,
*NL*
Andrea
threw
himself
upon
the
bed
;
the
keeper
retired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now

said
the
steward
,
``
what
have
you
to
tell
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And

said
Andrea
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

no

You
must
have
much

tell
me
,
since
you
have
come
to
seek
me

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
be
it
so

You
have
continued
your
course
of
villany

you

robbed

assassinated

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
Bertuccio
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
!
Gendarmes
,
I
am
at
your
service
.
Ah
,
sir
,
do
leave
a
few
crowns
*NL*
for
me
at
the
gate
that
I
may
have
some
things
I
am
in
need
of
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
shall
be
done
,
''
replied
Bertuccio
.
Andrea
extended
his
hand
;
*NL*
Bertuccio
kept
his
own
in
his
pocket
,
and
merely
jingled
a
few
pieces
*NL*
of
money
.
``
That
's
what
I
mean
,
''
said
Andrea
,
endeavoring
to
smile
,
quite
*NL*
overcome
by
the
strange
tranquillity
of
Bertuccio
.
``
Can
I
be
deceived
?
''
*NL*
he
murmured
,
as
he
stepped
into
the
oblong
and
grated
vehicle
which
they
*NL*
call
``
the
salad
basket
.
''
``
Never
mind
,
we
shall
see
!
To-morrow
,
then
!
''
he
*NL*
added
,
turning
towards
Bertuccio
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To-morrow
!

the
steward

Chapter

.
The
Judge
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
remember
that
the
Abbe
Busoni
remained
alone
with
Noirtier
in
the
*NL*
chamber
of
death
,
and
that
the
old
man
and
the
priest
were
the
sole
*NL*
guardians
of
the
young
girl
's
body
.
Perhaps
it
was
the
Christian
*NL*
exhortations
of
the
abbe
,
perhaps
his
kind
charity
,
perhaps
his
*NL*
persuasive
words
,
which
had
restored
the
courage
of
Noirtier
,
for
ever
*NL*
since
he
had
conversed
with
the
priest
his
violent
despair
had
yielded
*NL*
to
a
calm
resignation
which
surprised
all
who
knew
his
excessive
*NL*
affection
for
Valentine
.
M.
de
Villefort
had
not
seen
his
father
since
*NL*
the
morning
of
the
death
.
The
whole
establishment
had
been
changed
;
*NL*
another
valet
was
engaged
for
himself
,
a
new
servant
for
Noirtier
,
two
*NL*
women
had
entered
Madame
de
Villefort
's
service
,
--
in
fact
,
everywhere
,
*NL*
to
the
concierge
and
coachmen
,
new
faces
were
presented
to
the
different
*NL*
masters
of
the
house
,
thus
widening
the
division
which
had
always
*NL*
existed
between
the
members
of
the
same
family
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
assizes
,
also
,
were
about
to
begin
,
and
Villefort
,
shut
up
in
his
*NL*
room
,
exerted
himself
with
feverish
anxiety
in
drawing
up
the
case
*NL*
against
the
murderer
of
Caderousse
.
This
affair
,
like
all
those
in
which
*NL*
the
Count
of
Monte
Cristo
had
interfered
,
caused
a
great
sensation
in
*NL*
Paris
.
The
proofs
were
certainly
not
convincing
,
since
they
rested
upon
*NL*
a
few
words
written
by
an
escaped
galley-slave
on
his
death-bed
,
and
who
*NL*
might
have
been
actuated
by
hatred
or
revenge
in
accusing
his
companion
.
*NL*
But
the
mind
of
the
procureur
was
made
up
;
he
felt
assured
that
*NL*
Benedetto
was
guilty
,
and
he
hoped
by
his
skill
in
conducting
this
*NL*
aggravated
case
to
flatter
his
self-love
,
which
was
about
the
only
*NL*
vulnerable
point
left
in
his
frozen
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
case
was
therefore
prepared
owing
to
the
incessant
labor
of
*NL*
Villefort
,
who
wished
it
to
be
the
first
on
the
list
in
the
coming
*NL*
assizes
.
He
had
been
obliged
to
seclude
himself
more
than
ever
,
to
evade
*NL*
the
enormous
number
of
applications
presented
to
him
for
the
purpose
*NL*
of
obtaining
tickets
of
admission
to
the
court
on
the
day
of
trial
.
And
*NL*
then
so
short
a
time
had
elapsed
since
the
death
of
poor
Valentine
,
*NL*
and
the
gloom
which
overshadowed
the
house
was
so
recent
,
that
no
one
*NL*
wondered
to
see
the
father
so
absorbed
in
his
professional
duties
,
which
*NL*
were
the
only
means
he
had
of
dissipating
his
grief
.
*NL*
*NL*
Once
only
had
Villefort
seen
his
father
;
it
was
the
day
after
that
upon
*NL*
which
Bertuccio
had
paid
his
second
visit
to
Benedetto
,
when
the
latter
*NL*
was
to
learn
his
father
's
name
.
The
magistrate
,
harassed
and
fatigued
,
*NL*
had
descended
to
the
garden
of
his
house
,
and
in
a
gloomy
mood
,
similar
*NL*
to
that
in
which
Tarquin
lopped
off
the
tallest
poppies
,
he
began
*NL*
knocking
off
with
his
cane
the
long
and
dying
branches
of
the
*NL*
rose-trees
,
which
,
placed
along
the
avenue
,
seemed
like
the
spectres
of
*NL*
the
brilliant
flowers
which
had
bloomed
in
the
past
season
.
More
than
*NL*
once
he
had
reached
that
part
of
the
garden
where
the
famous
boarded
*NL*
gate
stood
overlooking
the
deserted
enclosure
,
always
returning
by
the
*NL*
same
path
,
to
begin
his
walk
again
,
at
the
same
pace
and
with
the
same
*NL*
gesture
,
when
he
accidentally
turned
his
eyes
towards
the
house
,
whence
*NL*
he
heard
the
noisy
play
of
his
son
,
who
had
returned
from
school
to
*NL*
spend
the
Sunday
and
Monday
with
his
mother
.
While
doing
so
,
he
observed
*NL*
M.
Noirtier
at
one
of
the
open
windows
,
where
the
old
man
had
been
*NL*
placed
that
he
might
enjoy
the
last
rays
of
the
sun
which
yet
yielded
*NL*
some
heat
,
and
was
now
shining
upon
the
dying
flowers
and
red
leaves
of
*NL*
the
creeper
which
twined
around
the
balcony
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
eye
of
the
old
man
was
riveted
upon
a
spot
which
Villefort
could
*NL*
scarcely
distinguish
.
His
glance
was
so
full
of
hate
,
of
ferocity
,
and
*NL*
savage
impatience
,
that
Villefort
turned
out
of
the
path
he
had
been
*NL*
pursuing
,
to
see
upon
what
person
this
dark
look
was
directed
.
Then
he
*NL*
saw
beneath
a
thick
clump
of
linden-trees
,
which
were
nearly
divested
*NL*
of
foliage
,
Madame
de
Villefort
sitting
with
a
book
in
her
hand
,
the
*NL*
perusal
of
which
she
frequently
interrupted
to
smile
upon
her
son
,
or
*NL*
to
throw
back
his
elastic
ball
,
which
he
obstinately
threw
from
the
*NL*
drawing-room
into
the
garden
.
Villefort
became
pale
;
he
understood
the
*NL*
old
man
's
meaning
.
Noirtier
continued
to
look
at
the
same
object
,
but
*NL*
suddenly
his
glance
was
transferred
from
the
wife
to
the
husband
,
and
*NL*
Villefort
himself
had
to
submit
to
the
searching
investigation
of
eyes
,
*NL*
which
,
while
changing
their
direction
and
even
their
language
,
had
lost
*NL*
none
of
their
menacing
expression
.
Madame
de
Villefort
,
unconscious
of
*NL*
the
passions
that
exhausted
their
fire
over
her
head
,
at
that
moment
*NL*
held
her
son
's
ball
,
and
was
making
signs
to
him
to
reclaim
it
with
a
*NL*
kiss
.
Edward
begged
for
a
long
while
,
the
maternal
kiss
probably
not
*NL*
offering
sufficient
recompense
for
the
trouble
he
must
take
to
obtain
*NL*
it
;
however
at
length
he
decided
,
leaped
out
of
the
window
into
a
*NL*
cluster
of
heliotropes
and
daisies
,
and
ran
to
his
mother
,
his
forehead
*NL*
streaming
with
perspiration
.
Madame
de
Villefort
wiped
his
forehead
,
*NL*
pressed
her
lips
upon
it
,
and
sent
him
back
with
the
ball
in
one
hand
*NL*
and
some
bonbons
in
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
Villefort
,
drawn
by
an
irresistible
attraction
,
like
that
of
the
bird
to
*NL*
the
serpent
,
walked
towards
the
house
.
As
he
approached
it
,
Noirtier
's
*NL*
gaze
followed
him
,
and
his
eyes
appeared
of
such
a
fiery
brightness
that
*NL*
Villefort
felt
them
pierce
to
the
depths
of
his
heart
.
In
that
earnest
*NL*
look
might
be
read
a
deep
reproach
,
as
well
as
a
terrible
menace
.
Then
*NL*
Noirtier
raised
his
eyes
to
heaven
,
as
though
to
remind
his
son
of
a
*NL*
forgotten
oath
.
``
It
is
well
,
sir
,
''
replied
Villefort
from
below
,
--
``
it
*NL*
is
well
;
have
patience
but
one
day
longer
;
what
I
have
said
I
will
do
.
''
*NL*
Noirtier
seemed
to
be
calmed
by
these
words
,
and
turned
his
eyes
with
*NL*
indifference
to
the
other
side
.
Villefort
violently
unbuttoned
his
*NL*
great-coat
,
which
seemed
to
strangle
him
,
and
passing
his
livid
hand
*NL*
across
his
forehead
,
entered
his
study
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
night
was
cold
and
still
;
the
family
had
all
retired
to
rest
but
*NL*
Villefort
,
who
alone
remained
up
,
and
worked
till
five
o'clock
in
the
*NL*
morning
,
reviewing
the
last
interrogatories
made
the
night
before
by
the
*NL*
examining
magistrates
,
compiling
the
depositions
of
the
witnesses
,
and
*NL*
putting
the
finishing
stroke
to
the
deed
of
accusation
,
which
was
one
of
*NL*
the
most
energetic
and
best
conceived
of
any
he
had
yet
delivered
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
,
Monday
,
was
the
first
sitting
of
the
assizes
.
The
morning
*NL*
dawned
dull
and
gloomy
,
and
Villefort
saw
the
dim
gray
light
shine
upon
*NL*
the
lines
he
had
traced
in
red
ink
.
The
magistrate
had
slept
for
a
short
*NL*
time
while
the
lamp
sent
forth
its
final
struggles
;
its
flickerings
*NL*
awoke
him
,
and
he
found
his
fingers
as
damp
and
purple
as
though
they
*NL*
had
been
dipped
in
blood
.
He
opened
the
window
;
a
bright
yellow
streak
*NL*
crossed
the
sky
,
and
seemed
to
divide
in
half
the
poplars
,
which
stood
*NL*
out
in
black
relief
on
the
horizon
.
In
the
clover-fields
beyond
the
*NL*
chestnut-trees
,
a
lark
was
mounting
up
to
heaven
,
while
pouring
out
her
*NL*
clear
morning
song
.
The
damps
of
the
dew
bathed
the
head
of
Villefort
,
*NL*
and
refreshed
his
memory
.
``
To-day
,
''
he
said
with
an
effort
,
--
``
to-day
the
*NL*
man
who
holds
the
blade
of
justice
must
strike
wherever
there
is
guilt
.
''
*NL*
Involuntarily
his
eyes
wandered
towards
the
window
of
Noirtier
's
room
,
*NL*
where
he
had
seen
him
the
preceding
night
.
The
curtain
was
drawn
,
and
*NL*
yet
the
image
of
his
father
was
so
vivid
to
his
mind
that
he
addressed
*NL*
the
closed
window
as
though
it
had
been
open
,
and
as
if
through
the
*NL*
opening
he
had
beheld
the
menacing
old
man
.
``
Yes
,
''
he
murmured
,
--
``
yes
,
*NL*
be
satisfied
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
head
dropped
upon
his
chest
,
and
in
this
position
he
paced
his
*NL*
study
;
then
he
threw
himself
,
dressed
as
he
was
,
upon
a
sofa
,
less
to
*NL*
sleep
than
to
rest
his
limbs
,
cramped
with
cold
and
study
.
By
degrees
*NL*
every
one
awoke
.
Villefort
,
from
his
study
,
heard
the
successive
noises
*NL*
which
accompany
the
life
of
a
house
,
--
the
opening
and
shutting
of
doors
,
*NL*
the
ringing
of
Madame
de
Villefort
's
bell
,
to
summon
the
waiting-maid
,
*NL*
mingled
with
the
first
shouts
of
the
child
,
who
rose
full
of
the
*NL*
enjoyment
of
his
age
.
Villefort
also
rang
;
his
new
valet
brought
him
the
*NL*
papers
,
and
with
them
a
cup
of
chocolate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
bringing
me
?
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
cup
of
chocolate
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
not
ask
for
it
.
Who
has
paid
me
this
attention
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
mistress
,
sir
.
She
said
you
would
have
to
speak
a
great
deal
in
*NL*
the
murder
case
,
and
that
you
should
take
something
to
keep
up
your
*NL*
strength
;
''
and
the
valet
placed
the
cup
on
the
table
nearest
to
the
*NL*
sofa
,
which
was
,
like
all
the
rest
,
covered
with
papers
.
The
valet
then
*NL*
left
the
room
.
Villefort
looked
for
an
instant
with
a
gloomy
expression
,
*NL*
then
,
suddenly
,
taking
it
up
with
a
nervous
motion
,
he
swallowed
its
*NL*
contents
at
one
draught
.
It
might
have
been
thought
that
he
hoped
the
*NL*
beverage
would
be
mortal
,
and
that
he
sought
for
death
to
deliver
him
*NL*
from
a
duty
which
he
would
rather
die
than
fulfil
.
He
then
rose
,
and
*NL*
paced
his
room
with
a
smile
it
would
have
been
terrible
to
witness
.
*NL*
The
chocolate
was
inoffensive
,
for
M.
de
Villefort
felt
no
effects
.
The
*NL*
breakfast-hour
arrived
,
but
M.
de
Villefort
was
not
at
table
.
The
valet
*NL*
re-entered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madame
de
Villefort
wishes
to
remind
you
,
sir
,
''
he
said
,
``
that
eleven
*NL*
o'clock
has
just
struck
,
and
that
the
trial
commences
at
twelve
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Villefort
,
``
what
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madame
de
Villefort
is
dressed
;
she
is
quite
ready
,
and
wishes
to
know
*NL*
if
she
is
to
accompany
you
,
sir
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
to
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
the
Palais
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
to
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
mistress
wishes
much
to
be
present
at
the
trial
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
said
Villefort
,
with
a
startling
accent
;
``
does
she
wish
*NL*
that
?
''
--
The
man
drew
back
and
said
,
``
If
you
wish
to
go
alone
,
sir
,
I
*NL*
will
go
and
tell
my
mistress
.
''
Villefort
remained
silent
for
a
moment
,
*NL*
and
dented
his
pale
cheeks
with
his
nails
.
``
Tell
your
mistress
,
''
he
at
*NL*
length
answered
,
``
that
I
wish
to
speak
to
her
,
and
I
beg
she
will
wait
*NL*
for
me
in
her
own
room
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
come
to
dress
and
shave
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Directly
,
sir
.
''
The
valet
re-appeared
almost
instantly
,
and
,
having
*NL*
shaved
his
master
,
assisted
him
to
dress
entirely
in
black
.
When
he
had
*NL*
finished
,
he
said
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
mistress
said
she
should
expect
you
,
sir
,
as
soon
as
you
had
*NL*
finished
dressing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
going
to
her
.
''
And
Villefort
,
with
his
papers
under
his
arm
and
*NL*
hat
in
hand
,
directed
his
steps
toward
the
apartment
of
his
wife
.
At
the
*NL*
door
he
paused
for
a
moment
to
wipe
his
damp
,
pale
brow
.
He
then
entered
*NL*
the
room
.
Madame
de
Villefort
was
sitting
on
an
ottoman
and
impatiently
*NL*
turning
over
the
leaves
of
some
newspapers
and
pamphlets
which
young
*NL*
Edward
,
by
way
of
amusing
himself
,
was
tearing
to
pieces
before
his
*NL*
mother
could
finish
reading
them
.
She
was
dressed
to
go
out
,
her
bonnet
*NL*
was
placed
beside
her
on
a
chair
,
and
her
gloves
were
on
her
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
here
you
are
,
monsieur
,
''
she
said
in
her
naturally
calm
voice
;
``
but
*NL*
how
pale
you
are
!
Have
you
been
working
all
night
?
Why
did
you
not
come
*NL*
down
to
breakfast
?
Well
,
will
you
take
me
,
or
shall
I
take
Edward
?
''
*NL*
Madame
de
Villefort
had
multiplied
her
questions
in
order
to
gain
one
*NL*
answer
,
but
to
all
her
inquiries
M.
de
Villefort
remained
mute
and
cold
*NL*
as
a
statue
.
``
Edward
,
''
said
Villefort
,
fixing
an
imperious
glance
on
*NL*
the
child
,
``
go
and
play
in
the
drawing-room
,
my
dear
;
I
wish
to
speak
*NL*
to
your
mamma
.
''
Madame
de
Villefort
shuddered
at
the
sight
of
that
cold
*NL*
countenance
,
that
resolute
tone
,
and
the
awfully
strange
preliminaries
.
*NL*
Edward
raised
his
head
,
looked
at
his
mother
,
and
then
,
finding
that
*NL*
she
did
not
confirm
the
order
,
began
cutting
off
the
heads
of
his
leaden
*NL*
soldiers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Edward
,
''
cried
M.
de
Villefort
,
so
harshly
that
the
child
started
up
*NL*
from
the
floor
,
``
do
you
hear
me
?
--
Go
!
''
The
child
,
unaccustomed
to
such
*NL*
treatment
,
arose
,
pale
and
trembling
;
it
would
be
difficult
to
say
*NL*
whether
his
emotion
were
caused
by
fear
or
passion
.
His
father
went
up
*NL*
to
him
,
took
him
in
his
arms
,
and
kissed
his
forehead
.
``
Go
,
''
he
said
:
*NL*
``
go
,
my
child
.
''
Edward
ran
out
.
M.
de
Villefort
went
to
the
door
,
which
*NL*
he
closed
behind
the
child
,
and
bolted
.
``
Dear
me
!
''
said
the
young
woman
,
*NL*
endeavoring
to
read
her
husband
's
inmost
thoughts
,
while
a
smile
passed
*NL*
over
her
countenance
which
froze
the
impassibility
of
Villefort
;
``
what
*NL*
is
the
matter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madame
,
where
do
you
keep
the
poison
you
generally
use
?
''
said
the
*NL*
magistrate
,
without
any
introduction
,
placing
himself
between
his
wife
*NL*
and
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Villefort
must
have
experienced
something
of
the
sensation
of
*NL*
a
bird
which
,
looking
up
,
sees
the
murderous
trap
closing
over
its
head
.
*NL*
A
hoarse
,
broken
tone
,
which
was
neither
a
cry
nor
a
sigh
,
escaped
from
*NL*
her
,
while
she
became
deadly
pale
.
``
Monsieur
,
''
she
said
,
``
I
--
I
do
not
*NL*
understand
you
.
''
And
,
in
her
first
paroxysm
of
terror
,
she
had
raised
*NL*
herself
from
the
sofa
,
in
the
next
,
stronger
very
likely
than
the
other
,
*NL*
she
fell
down
again
on
the
cushions
.
``
I
asked
you
,
''
continued
Villefort
,
*NL*
in
a
perfectly
calm
tone
,
``
where
you
conceal
the
poison
by
the
aid
*NL*
of
which
you
have
killed
my
father-in-law
,
M.
de
Saint-Meran
,
my
*NL*
mother-in-law
,
Madame
de
Saint-Meran
,
Barrois
,
and
my
daughter
*NL*
Valentine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
sir
,
''
exclaimed
Madame
de
Villefort
,
clasping
her
hands
,
``
what
do
*NL*
you
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
not
for
you
to
interrogate
,
but
to
answer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
to
the
judge
or
to
the
husband
?
''
stammered
Madame
de
Villefort
.
*NL*
``
To
the
judge
--
to
the
judge
,
madame
!
''
It
was
terrible
to
behold
the
*NL*
frightful
pallor
of
that
woman
,
the
anguish
of
her
look
,
the
trembling
*NL*
of
her
whole
frame
.
``
Ah
,
sir
,
''
she
muttered
,
``
ah
,
sir
,
''
and
this
was
*NL*
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
not
answer
,
madame
!
''
exclaimed
the
terrible
interrogator
.
Then
*NL*
he
added
,
with
a
smile
yet
more
terrible
than
his
anger
,
``
It
is
true
,
*NL*
then
;
you
do
not
deny
it
!
''
She
moved
forward
.
``
And
you
can
not
deny
it
!
''
*NL*
added
Villefort
,
extending
his
hand
toward
her
,
as
though
to
seize
her
*NL*
in
the
name
of
justice
.
``
You
have
accomplished
these
different
crimes
*NL*
with
impudent
address
,
but
which
could
only
deceive
those
whose
*NL*
affections
for
you
blinded
them
.
Since
the
death
of
Madame
de
*NL*
Saint-Meran
,
I
have
known
that
a
poisoner
lived
in
my
house
.
M.
*NL*
d'Avrigny
warned
me
of
it
.
After
the
death
of
Barrois
my
suspicions
were
*NL*
directed
towards
an
angel
,
--
those
suspicions
which
,
even
when
there
*NL*
is
no
crime
,
are
always
alive
in
my
heart
;
but
after
the
death
of
*NL*
Valentine
,
there
has
been
no
doubt
in
my
mind
,
madame
,
and
not
only
in
*NL*
mine
,
but
in
those
of
others
;
thus
your
crime
,
known
by
two
persons
,
*NL*
suspected
by
many
,
will
soon
become
public
,
and
,
as
I
told
you
just
now
,
*NL*
you
no
longer
speak
to
the
husband
,
but
to
the
judge

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
woman
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
.
``
Oh
,
sir
,
''
she
stammered
,
``
I
*NL*
beseech
you

do
not
believe
appearances

*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
,
then

a
coward

cried
Villefort
,
in
a
contemptuous
voice
.
*NL*
``
But
I
have
always
observed
that
poisoners
were
cowards

Can
you
be
a
*NL*
coward
,

you
who
have
had
the
courage
to
witness
the
death
of
two
old

a
young

murdered
by
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir

*NL*
*NL*

continued
Villefort

with
increasing
excitement

``
you

could
count

one
by

the

four
death
agonies

You

who
have
arranged
your
infernal
plans

removed
the
beverages
*NL*
with
a
talent

precision
almost
miraculous
?
Have
you
,
then
,
who
have
*NL*
calculated
everything
with
such
nicety

have
you
forgotten
to
calculate

one

I

where
the
revelation

will
lead
you
to
?
*NL*
Oh

it

impossible

must
have
saved
some
surer

more
subtle

deadly
poison
than
any
other

that
you
might
escape
the
punishment
*NL*
that
you
deserve

You
have
done
this

I
hope
so

at

Madame
de
*NL*
Villefort
stretched
out
her
hands
,
and
fell
on
her
knees
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
understand

he
said
,
``
you
confess

a
confession

the
punishment
inflicted
on

guilty
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
The
punishment

exclaimed
Madame

Twice

pronounced

*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly

Did
you
hope
to
escape
it

four

guilty

be
withheld

you

the

pronounces
it

No

taken
the
precaution

keeping
for
herself
a
few
drops
of
her

deadliest
potion

Madame
de
Villefort
uttered
a
wild
cry
,
and
a
hideous
*NL*
and
uncontrollable
terror
spread
over
her
distorted
features
.
``
Oh
,
*NL*
do
not
fear
the
scaffold

said
the
magistrate
;

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

stammered
the
unhappy

woman

completely
overwhelmed
.
``
I
mean

she
rose

dishevelled

foaming

Madame

raised

to

convulsively
struck
one

against

*NL*

a
frightful

finished
the

was
lost
in

Madame

Villefort
fell
at
her
husband

feet

He
approached
her

``
Think

*NL*
She
listened
,
panting
,
overwhelmed
,
crushed
;
her
eye
alone
lived
,
and
*NL*
glared
horribly
.
``
Do
you
understand

he
said
.
``
I
am
going
down
there

If

alive

you

sleep
to-night

''
*NL*
Madame
de
Villefort
sighed
;
her
nerves
gave
way
,
and
she
sunk
on
the
*NL*
carpet
.
The
king
's
attorney
seemed
to
experience
a
sensation
of
pity
;
*NL*
he
looked
upon
her
less
severely
,
and
,
bowing
to
her
,
said
slowly
,
*NL*
``
Farewell

madame

farewell

''
That
farewell
struck
Madame
de
Villefort
*NL*
like
the
executioner

knife
.
She
fainted
.

The
Benedetto
affair
,
as
it
was
called
at
the
Palais
,
and
by
people
in
*NL*
general
,
had
produced
a
tremendous
sensation
.
Frequenting
the
Cafe
de
*NL*
Paris
,
the
Boulevard
de
Gand
,
and
the
Bois
de
Boulogne
,
during
his
*NL*
brief
career
of
splendor
,
the
false
Cavalcanti
had
formed
a
host
of
*NL*
acquaintances
.
The
papers
had
related
his
various
adventures
,
both
as
*NL*
the
man
of
fashion
and
the
galley-slave
;
and
as
every
one
who
had
been
*NL*
personally
acquainted
with
Prince
Andrea
Cavalcanti
experienced
a
*NL*
lively
curiosity
in
his
fate
,
they
all
determined
to
spare
no
trouble
in
*NL*
endeavoring
to
witness
the
trial
of
M.
Benedetto
for
the
murder
of
his
*NL*
comrade
in
chains
.
In
the
eyes
of
many
,
Benedetto
appeared
,
if
not
*NL*
a
victim
to
,
at
least
an
instance
of
,
the
fallibility
of
the
law
.
M.
*NL*
Cavalcanti
,
his
father
,
had
been
seen
in
Paris
,
and
it
was
expected
that
*NL*
he
would
re-appear
to
claim
the
illustrious
outcast
.
Many
,
also
,
who
*NL*
were
not
aware
of
the
circumstances
attending
his
withdrawal
from
Paris
,
*NL*
were
struck
with
the
worthy
appearance
,
the
gentlemanly
bearing
,
and
*NL*
the
knowledge
of
the
world
displayed
by
the
old
patrician
,
who
certainly
*NL*
played
the
nobleman
very
well
,
so
long
as
he
said
nothing
,
and
made
no
*NL*
arithmetical
calculations
.
As
for
the
accused
himself
,
many
remembered
*NL*
him
as
being
so
amiable
,
so
handsome
,
and
so
liberal
,
that
they
chose
*NL*
to
think
him
the
victim
of
some
conspiracy
,
since
in
this
world
large
*NL*
fortunes
frequently
excite
the
malevolence
and
jealousy
of
some
unknown
*NL*
enemy
.
Every
one
,
therefore
,
ran
to
the
court
;
some
to
witness
the
*NL*
sight
,
others
to
comment
upon
it
.
From
seven
o'clock
in
the
morning
*NL*
a
crowd
was
stationed
at
the
iron
gates
,
and
an
hour
before
the
trial
*NL*
commenced
the
hall
was
full
of
the
privileged
.
Before
the
entrance
of
*NL*
the
magistrates
,
and
indeed
frequently
afterwards
,
a
court
of
justice
,
*NL*
on
days
when
some
especial
trial
is
to
take
place
,
resembles
a
*NL*
drawing-room
where
many
persons
recognize
each
other
and
converse
if
*NL*
they
can
do
so
without
losing
their
seats
;
or
,
if
they
are
separated
by
*NL*
too
great
a
number
of
lawyers
,
communicate
by
signs
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
one
of
the
magnificent
autumn
days
which
make
amends
for
a
short
*NL*
summer
;
the
clouds
which
M.
de
Villefort
had
perceived
at
sunrise
*NL*
had
all
disappeared
as
if
by
magic
,
and
one
of
the
softest
and
most
*NL*
brilliant
days
of
September
shone
forth
in
all
its
splendor
.
*NL*
*NL*
Beauchamp
,
one
of
the
kings
of
the
press
,
and
therefore
claiming
the
*NL*
right
of
a
throne
everywhere
,
was
eying
everybody
through
his
monocle
.
*NL*
He
perceived
Chateau-Renaud
and
Debray
,
who
had
just
gained
the
good
*NL*
graces
of
a
sergeant-at-arms
,
and
who
had
persuaded
the
latter
to
let
*NL*
them
stand
before
,
instead
of
behind
him
,
as
they
ought
to
have
done
.
*NL*
The
worthy
sergeant
had
recognized
the
minister
's
secretary
and
the
*NL*
millionnaire
,
and
,
by
way
of
paying
extra
attention
to
his
noble
*NL*
neighbors
,
promised
to
keep
their
places
while
they
paid
a
visit
to
*NL*
Beauchamp
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Beauchamp
,
``
we
shall
see
our
friend
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
indeed
!
''
replied
Debray
.
``
That
worthy
prince

Deuce

those
*NL*
Italian
princes

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
man
,
too

who
could
boast
of
Dante

genealogist

reckon
back
to
the
`
Divine
Comedy

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A

Chateau-Renaud
phlegmatically
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
will
be
condemned
,

he
not

asked
Debray
of
Beauchamp
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
fellow
,
I
think
we
should
ask
you
that
question

you
know
such

Yes

you

Oh

is
a

*NL*
happened

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

he
told
me
that
Benedetto

who
is
considered
a
serpent
of
*NL*
subtlety

a
giant
of
cunning
,
is
really
but
a
very
commonplace

silly

altogether
unworthy

made

*NL*
*NL*

Beauchamp

played
the

delighted

not
for
me

who
scent
out
an
aristocratic
family
like
a

very
bloodhound
of

*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
never
believed

principality

*NL*

Yes

not
in

*NL*
*NL*
``

Beauchamp

still

I
assure
you

passed
very
well

*NL*

Ah

Chateau-Renaud

*NL*
*NL*

There
is
something

laughing

to

placing

Debray
colored
slightly

followed
with
his

the
direction
of

Do
you
see
the
waistcoat
?
There
it
is
,
all
*NL*
blood-stained
,
on
the
desk
,
as
a
testimony
of
the
crime

``
Ah

*NL*
``
Hush
,
gentlemen
,
here
is
the
court
;
let
us
go
back
to
our
places

''
A
*NL*
noise
was
heard
in
the
hall
;
the
sergeant
called
his
two
patrons
with
*NL*
an
energetic
``
hem
!
''
and
the
door-keeper
appearing
,
called
out
with
that
*NL*
shrill
voice
peculiar
to
his
order
,
ever
since
the
days
of
Beaumarchais

Chapter
110
.
The
Indictment
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
judges
took
their
places
in
the
midst
of
the
most
profound
silence
;
*NL*
the
jury
took
their
seats
;
M.
de
Villefort
,
the
object
of
unusual
*NL*
attention
,
and
we
had
almost
said
of
general
admiration
,
sat
in
the
*NL*
arm-chair
and
cast
a
tranquil
glance
around
him
.
Every
one
looked
*NL*
with
astonishment
on
that
grave
and
severe
face
,
whose
calm
expression
*NL*
personal
griefs
had
been
unable
to
disturb
,
and
the
aspect
of
a
man
who
*NL*
was
a
stranger
to
all
human
emotions
excited
something
very
like
terror
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gendarmes
,
''
said
the
president
,
``
lead
in
the
accused
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
these
words
the
public
attention
became
more
intense
,
and
all
eyes
*NL*
were
turned
towards
the
door
through
which
Benedetto
was
to
enter
.
*NL*
The
door
soon
opened
and
the
accused
appeared
.
The
same
impression
was
*NL*
experienced
by
all
present
,
and
no
one
was
deceived
by
the
expression
*NL*
of
his
countenance
.
His
features
bore
no
sign
of
that
deep
emotion
*NL*
which
stops
the
beating
of
the
heart
and
blanches
the
cheek
.
His
hands
,
*NL*
gracefully
placed
,
one
upon
his
hat
,
the
other
in
the
opening
of
his
*NL*
white
waistcoat
,
were
not
at
all
tremulous
;
his
eye
was
calm
and
even
*NL*
brilliant
.
Scarcely
had
he
entered
the
hall
when
he
glanced
at
the
*NL*
whole
body
of
magistrates
and
assistants
;
his
eye
rested
longer
on
the
*NL*
president
,
and
still
more
so
on
the
king
's
attorney
.
By
the
side
of
*NL*
Andrea
was
stationed
the
lawyer
who
was
to
conduct
his
defence
,
and
*NL*
who
had
been
appointed
by
the
court
,
for
Andrea
disdained
to
pay
*NL*
any
attention
to
those
details
,
to
which
he
appeared
to
attach
no
*NL*
importance
.
The
lawyer
was
a
young
man
with
light
hair
whose
face
*NL*
expressed
a
hundred
times
more
emotion
than
that
which
characterized
the
*NL*
prisoner
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
president
called
for
the
indictment
,
revised
as
we
know
,
by
the
*NL*
clever
and
implacable
pen
of
Villefort
.
During
the
reading
of
this
,
*NL*
which
was
long
,
the
public
attention
was
continually
drawn
towards
*NL*
Andrea
,
who
bore
the
inspection
with
Spartan
unconcern
.
Villefort
had
*NL*
never
been
so
concise
and
eloquent
.
The
crime
was
depicted
in
the
most
*NL*
vivid
colors
;
the
former
life
of
the
prisoner
,
his
transformation
,
a
*NL*
review
of
his
life
from
the
earliest
period
,
were
set
forth
with
all
the
*NL*
talent
that
a
knowledge
of
human
life
could
furnish
to
a
mind
like
that
*NL*
of
the
procureur
.
Benedetto
was
thus
forever
condemned
in
public
opinion
*NL*
before
the
sentence
of
the
law
could
be
pronounced
.
Andrea
paid
no
*NL*
attention
to
the
successive
charges
which
were
brought
against
him
.
M.
*NL*
de
Villefort
,
who
examined
him
attentively
,
and
who
no
doubt
practiced
*NL*
upon
him
all
the
psychological
studies
he
was
accustomed
to
use
,
in
vain
*NL*
endeavored
to
make
him
lower
his
eyes
,
notwithstanding
the
depth
and
*NL*
profundity
of
his
gaze
.
At
length
the
reading
of
the
indictment
was
*NL*
ended
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Accused
,
''
said
the
president
,
``
your
name
and
surname
?
''
Andrea
arose
.
*NL*
``
Excuse
me
,
Mr.
President
,
''
he
said
,
in
a
clear
voice
,
``
but
I
see
you
*NL*
are
going
to
adopt
a
course
of
questions
through
which
I
can
not
follow
*NL*
you
.
I
have
an
idea
,
which
I
will
explain
by
and
by
,
of
making
an
*NL*
exception
to
the
usual
form
of
accusation
.
Allow
me
,
then
,
if
you
*NL*
please
,
to
answer
in
different
order
,
or
I
will
not
do
so
at
all
.
''
*NL*
The
astonished
president
looked
at
the
jury
,
who
in
turn
looked
at
*NL*
Villefort
.
The
whole
assembly
manifested
great
surprise
,
but
Andrea
*NL*
appeared
quite
unmoved
.
``
Your
age
?
''
said
the
president
;
``
will
you
answer
*NL*
that
question
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
answer
that
question
,
as
well
as
the
rest
,
Mr.
President
,
but
in
*NL*
its
turn
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
age
?
''
repeated
the
president
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
twenty-one
years
old
,
or
rather
I
shall
be
in
a
few
days
,
as
I
was
*NL*
born
the
night
of
the
27th
of
September
,
1817
.
''
M.
de
Villefort
,
who
*NL*
was
busy
taking
down
some
notes
,
raised
his
head
at
the
mention
of
this
*NL*
date
.
``
Where
were
you
born
?
''
continued
the
president
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
Auteuil
,
near
Paris
.
''
M.
de
Villefort
a
second
time
raised
his
head
,
*NL*
looked
at
Benedetto
as
if
he
had
been
gazing
at
the
head
of
Medusa
,
and
*NL*
became
livid
.
As
for
Benedetto
,
he
gracefully
wiped
his
lips
with
a
fine
*NL*
cambric
pocket-handkerchief
.
``
Your
profession
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
First
I
was
a
forger
,
''
answered
Andrea
,
as
calmly
as
possible
;
``
then
I
*NL*
became
a
thief
,
and
lately
have
become
an
assassin
.
''
A
murmur
,
or
rather
*NL*
storm
,
of
indignation
burst
from
all
parts
of
the
assembly
.
The
judges
*NL*
themselves
appeared
to
be
stupefied
,
and
the
jury
manifested
tokens
of
*NL*
disgust
for
cynicism
so
unexpected
in
a
man
of
fashion
.
M.
de
Villefort
*NL*
pressed
his
hand
upon
his
brow
,
which
,
at
first
pale
,
had
become
red
and
*NL*
burning
;
then
he
suddenly
arose
and
looked
around
as
though
he
had
lost
*NL*
his
senses
--
he
wanted
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
looking
for
anything
,
Mr.
Procureur
?
''
asked
Benedetto
,
with
his
*NL*
most
ingratiating
smile
.
M.
de
Villefort
answered
nothing
,
but
sat
,
or
*NL*
rather
threw
himself
down
again
upon
his
chair
.
``
And
now
,
prisoner
,
*NL*
will
you
consent
to
tell
your
name
?
''
said
the
president
.
``
The
brutal
*NL*
affectation
with
which
you
have
enumerated
and
classified
your
crimes
*NL*
calls
for
a
severe
reprimand
on
the
part
of
the
court
,
both
in
the
name
*NL*
of
morality
,
and
for
the
respect
due
to
humanity
.
You
appear
to
consider
*NL*
this
a
point
of
honor
,
and
it
may
be
for
this
reason
,
that
you
have
*NL*
delayed
acknowledging
your
name
.
You
wished
it
to
be
preceded
by
all
*NL*
these
titles
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
quite
wonderful
,
Mr.
President
,
how
entirely
you
have
read
my
*NL*
thoughts
,
''
said
Benedetto
,
in
his
softest
voice
and
most
polite
manner
.
*NL*
``
This
is
,
indeed
,
the
reason
why
I
begged
you
to
alter
the
order
of
the
*NL*
questions
.
''
The
public
astonishment
had
reached
its
height
.
There
was
no
*NL*
longer
any
deceit
or
bravado
in
the
manner
of
the
accused
.
The
audience
*NL*
felt
that
a
startling
revelation
was
to
follow
this
ominous
prelude
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
the
president
;
``
your
name
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
tell
you
my
name
,
since
I
do
not
know
it
;
but
I
know
my
*NL*
father
's
,
and
can
tell
it
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
painful
giddiness
overwhelmed
Villefort
;
great
drops
of
acrid
sweat
*NL*
fell
from
his
face
upon
the
papers
which
he
held
in
his
convulsed
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Repeat
your
father
's
name
,
''
said
the
president
.
Not
a
whisper
,
not
a
*NL*
breath
,
was
heard
in
that
vast
assembly
;
every
one
waited
anxiously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
father
is
king
's
attorney
,
''
replied
Andrea
calmly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
King
's
attorney
?
''
said
the
president
,
stupefied
,
and
without
noticing
*NL*
the
agitation
which
spread
over
the
face
of
M.
de
Villefort
;
``
king
's
*NL*
attorney
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
and
if
you
wish
to
know
his
name
,
I
will
tell
it
,
--
he
is
named
*NL*
Villefort
.
''
The
explosion
,
which
had
been
so
long
restrained
from
a
*NL*
feeling
of
respect
to
the
court
of
justice
,
now
burst
forth
like
thunder
*NL*
from
the
breasts
of
all
present
;
the
court
itself
did
not
seek
to
*NL*
restrain
the
feelings
of
the
audience
.
The
exclamations
,
the
insults
*NL*
addressed
to
Benedetto
,
who
remained
perfectly
unconcerned
,
the
*NL*
energetic
gestures
,
the
movement
of
the
gendarmes
,
the
sneers
of
the
*NL*
scum
of
the
crowd
always
sure
to
rise
to
the
surface
in
case
of
any
*NL*
disturbance
--
all
this
lasted
five
minutes
,
before
the
door-keepers
and
*NL*
magistrates
were
able
to
restore
silence
.
In
the
midst
of
this
tumult
*NL*
the
voice
of
the
president
was
heard
to
exclaim
,
--
``
Are
you
playing
with
*NL*
justice
,
accused
,
and
do
you
dare
set
your
fellow-citizens
an
example
of
*NL*
disorder
which
even
in
these
times
has
never
been
equalled
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Several
persons
hurried
up
to
M.
de
Villefort
,
who
sat
half
bowed
over
*NL*
in
his
chair
,
offering
him
consolation
,
encouragement
,
and
protestations
*NL*
of
zeal
and
sympathy
.
Order
was
re-established
in
the
hall
,
except
that
*NL*
a
few
people
still
moved
about
and
whispered
to
one
another
.
A
lady
,
*NL*
it
was
said
,
had
just
fainted
;
they
had
supplied
her
with
a
*NL*
smelling-bottle
,
and
she
had
recovered
.
During
the
scene
of
tumult
,
*NL*
Andrea
had
turned
his
smiling
face
towards
the
assembly
;
then
,
leaning
*NL*
with
one
hand
on
the
oaken
rail
of
the
dock
,
in
the
most
graceful
*NL*
attitude
possible
,
he
said
:
``
Gentlemen
,
I
assure
you
I
had
no
idea
of
*NL*
insulting
the
court
,
or
of
making
a
useless
disturbance
in
the
presence
*NL*
of
this
honorable
assembly
.
They
ask
my
age
;
I
tell
it
.
They
ask
where
I
*NL*
was
born
;
I
answer
.
They
ask
my
name
,
I
can
not
give
it
,
since
my
parents
*NL*
abandoned
me
.
But
though
I
can
not
give
my
own
name
,
not
possessing
one
,
*NL*
I
can
tell
them
my
father
's
.
Now
I
repeat
,
my
father
is
named
M.
de
*NL*
Villefort
,
and
I
am
ready
to
prove
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
an
energy
,
a
conviction
,
and
a
sincerity
in
the
manner
of
the
*NL*
young
man
,
which
silenced
the
tumult
.
All
eyes
were
turned
for
a
moment
*NL*
towards
the
procureur
,
who
sat
as
motionless
as
though
a
thunderbolt
had
*NL*
changed
him
into
a
corpse
.
``
Gentlemen
,
''
said
Andrea
,
commanding
silence
*NL*
by
his
voice
and
manner
;
``
I
owe
you
the
proofs
and
explanations
of
what
*NL*
I
have
said
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
''
said
the
irritated
president
,
``
you
called
yourself
Benedetto
,
*NL*
declared
yourself
an
orphan
,
and
claimed
Corsica
as
your
country
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
said
anything
I
pleased
,
in
order
that
the
solemn
declaration
I
have
*NL*
just
made
should
not
be
withheld
,
which
otherwise
would
certainly
have
*NL*
been
the
case
.
I
now
repeat
that
I
was
born
at
Auteuil
on
the
night
of
*NL*
the
27th
of
September
,
1817
,
and
that
I
am
the
son
of
the
procureur
,
M.
*NL*
de
Villefort
.
Do
you
wish
for
any
further
details
?
I
will
give
them
.
I
*NL*
was
born
in
No.
28
,
Rue
de
la
Fontaine
,
in
a
room
hung
with
red
damask
;
*NL*
my
father
took
me
in
his
arms
,
telling
my
mother
I
was
dead
,
wrapped
*NL*
me
in
a
napkin
marked
with
an
H
and
an
N
,
and
carried
me
into
a
garden
,
*NL*
where
he
buried
me
alive
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
shudder
ran
through
the
assembly
when
they
saw
that
the
confidence
of
*NL*
the
prisoner
increased
in
proportion
to
the
terror
of
M.
de
Villefort
.
*NL*
``
But
how
have
you
become
acquainted
with
all
these
details
?
''
asked
the
*NL*
president
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
tell
you
,
Mr.
President
.
A
man
who
had
sworn
vengeance
against
*NL*
my
father
,
and
had
long
watched
his
opportunity
to
kill
him
,
had
*NL*
introduced
himself
that
night
into
the
garden
in
which
my
father
buried
*NL*
me
.
He
was
concealed
in
a
thicket
;
he
saw
my
father
bury
something
in
*NL*
the
ground
,
and
stabbed
him
;
then
thinking
the
deposit
might
contain
*NL*
some
treasure
he
turned
up
the
ground
,
and
found
me
still
living
.
The
*NL*
man
carried
me
to
the
foundling
asylum
,
where
I
was
registered
under
the
*NL*
number
37
.
Three
months
afterwards
,
a
woman
travelled
from
Rogliano
to
*NL*
Paris
to
fetch
me
,
and
having
claimed
me
as
her
son
,
carried
me
away
.
*NL*
Thus
,
you
see
,
though
born
in
Paris
,
I
was
brought
up
in
Corsica
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
moment
's
silence
,
during
which
one
could
have
fancied
*NL*
the
hall
empty
,
so
profound
was
the
stillness
.
``
Proceed
,
''
said
the
*NL*
president
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
,
I
might
have
lived
happily
amongst
those
good
people
,
who
*NL*
adored
me
,
but
my
perverse
disposition
prevailed
over
the
virtues
which
*NL*
my
adopted
mother
endeavored
to
instil
into
my
heart
.
I
increased
in
*NL*
wickedness
till
I
committed
crime
.
One
day
when
I
cursed
Providence
for
*NL*
making
me
so
wicked
,
and
ordaining
me
to
such
a
fate
,
my
adopted
father
*NL*
said
to
me
,
`
Do
not
blaspheme
,
unhappy
child
,
the
crime
is
that
of
your
*NL*
father
,
not
yours
,
--
of
your
father
,
who
consigned
you
to
hell
if
you
*NL*
died
,
and
to
misery
if
a
miracle
preserved
you
alive
.
'
After
that
I
*NL*
ceased
to
blaspheme
,
but
I
cursed
my
father
.
That
is
why
I
have
uttered
*NL*
the
words
for
which
you
blame
me
;
that
is
why
I
have
filled
this
whole
*NL*
assembly
with
horror
.
If
I
have
committed
an
additional
crime
,
punish
*NL*
me
,
but
if
you
will
allow
that
ever
since
the
day
of
my
birth
my
fate
*NL*
has
been
sad
,
bitter
,
and
lamentable
,
then
pity
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
your
mother
?
''
asked
the
president
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
mother
thought
me
dead
;
she
is
not
guilty
.
I
did
not
even
wish
to
*NL*
know
her
name
,
nor
do
I
know
it
.
''
Just
then
a
piercing
cry
,
ending
in
a
*NL*
sob
,
burst
from
the
centre
of
the
crowd
,
who
encircled
the
lady
who
had
*NL*
before
fainted
,
and
who
now
fell
into
a
violent
fit
of
hysterics
.
She
*NL*
was
carried
out
of
the
hall
,
the
thick
veil
which
concealed
her
face
*NL*
dropped
off
,
and
Madame
Danglars
was
recognized
.
Notwithstanding
his
*NL*
shattered
nerves
,
the
ringing
sensation
in
his
ears
,
and
the
madness
*NL*
which
turned
his
brain
,
Villefort
rose
as
he
perceived
her
.
``
The
proofs
,
*NL*
the
proofs
!
''
said
the
president
;
``
remember
this
tissue
of
horrors
must
*NL*
be
supported
by
the
clearest
proofs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
proofs
?
''
said
Benedetto
,
laughing
;
``
do
you
want
proofs
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
look
at
M.
de
Villefort
,
and
then
ask
me
for
proofs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Every
one
turned
towards
the
procureur
,
who
,
unable
to
bear
the
*NL*
universal
gaze
now
riveted
on
him
alone
,
advanced
staggering
into
the
*NL*
midst
of
the
tribunal
,
with
his
hair
dishevelled
and
his
face
indented
*NL*
with
the
mark
of
his
nails
.
The
whole
assembly
uttered
a
long
murmur
of
*NL*
astonishment
.
``
Father
,
''
said
Benedetto
,
``
I
am
asked
for
proofs
,
do
you
*NL*
wish
me
to
give
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
it
is
useless
,
''
stammered
M.
de
Villefort
in
a
hoarse
voice
;
*NL*
``
no
,
it
is
useless
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
useless
?
''
cried
the
president
,
``
what
do
you
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
mean
that
I
feel
it
impossible
to
struggle
against
this
deadly
weight
*NL*
which
crushes
me
.
Gentlemen
,
I
know
I
am
in
the
hands
of
an
avenging
*NL*
God
!
We
need
no
proofs
;
everything
relating
to
this
young
man
is
true
.
''
*NL*
A
dull
,
gloomy
silence
,
like
that
which
precedes
some
awful
phenomenon
*NL*
of
nature
,
pervaded
the
assembly
,
who
shuddered
in
dismay
.
``
What
,
M.
*NL*
de
Villefort
,
''
cried
the
president
,
``
do
you
yield
to
an
hallucination
?
*NL*
What
,
are
you
no
longer
in
possession
of
your
senses
?
This
strange
,
*NL*
unexpected
,
terrible
accusation
has
disordered
your
reason
.
Come
,
*NL*
recover
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
procureur
dropped
his
head
;
his
teeth
chattered
like
those
of
a
man
*NL*
under
a
violent
attack
of
fever
,
and
yet
he
was
deadly
pale
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
in
possession
of
all
my
senses
,
sir
,
''
he
said
;
``
my
body
alone
*NL*
suffers
,
as
you
may
suppose
.
I
acknowledge
myself
guilty
of
all
the
*NL*
young
man
has
brought
against
me
,
and
from
this
hour
hold
myself
under
*NL*
the
authority
of
the
procureur
who
will
succeed
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
as
he
spoke
these
words
with
a
hoarse
,
choking
voice
,
he
staggered
*NL*
towards
the
door
,
which
was
mechanically
opened
by
a
door-keeper
.
*NL*
The
whole
assembly
were
dumb
with
astonishment
at
the
revelation
and
*NL*
confession
which
had
produced
a
catastrophe
so
different
from
that
which
*NL*
had
been
expected
during
the
last
fortnight
by
the
Parisian
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Beauchamp
,
``
let
them
now
say
that
drama
is
unnatural
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ma
foi
!
''
said
Chateau-Renaud
,
``
I
would
rather
end
my
career
like
M.
*NL*
de
Morcerf
;
a
pistol-shot
seems
quite
delightful
compared
with
this
*NL*
catastrophe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
moreover
,
it
kills
,
''
said
Beauchamp
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
to
think
that
I
had
an
idea
of
marrying
his
daughter
,
''
said
Debray
.
*NL*
``
She
did
well
to
die
,
poor
girl
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
sitting
is
adjourned
,
gentlemen
,
''
said
the
president
;
``
fresh
*NL*
inquiries
will
be
made
,
and
the
case
will
be
tried
next
session
by
*NL*
another
magistrate
.
''
As
for
Andrea
,
who
was
calm
and
more
interesting
*NL*
than
ever
,
he
left
the
hall
,
escorted
by
gendarmes
,
who
involuntarily
*NL*
paid
him
some
attention
.
``
Well
,
what
do
you
think
of
this
,
my
fine
*NL*
fellow
?
''
asked
Debray
of
the
sergeant-at-arms
,
slipping
a
louis
into
his
*NL*
hand
.
``
There
will
be
extenuating
circumstances
,

he
replied

Chapter
111
.
Expiation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Notwithstanding
the
density
of
the
crowd
,
M.
de
Villefort
saw
it
open
*NL*
before
him
.
There
is
something
so
awe-inspiring
in
great
afflictions
*NL*
that
even
in
the
worst
times
the
first
emotion
of
a
crowd
has
generally
*NL*
been
to
sympathize
with
the
sufferer
in
a
great
catastrophe
.
Many
people
*NL*
have
been
assassinated
in
a
tumult
,
but
even
criminals
have
rarely
*NL*
been
insulted
during
trial
.
Thus
Villefort
passed
through
the
mass
*NL*
of
spectators
and
officers
of
the
Palais
,
and
withdrew
.
Though
he
had
*NL*
acknowledged
his
guilt
,
he
was
protected
by
his
grief
.
There
are
*NL*
some
situations
which
men
understand
by
instinct
,
but
which
reason
is
*NL*
powerless
to
explain
;
in
such
cases
the
greatest
poet
is
he
who
gives
*NL*
utterance
to
the
most
natural
and
vehement
outburst
of
sorrow
.
Those
*NL*
who
hear
the
bitter
cry
are
as
much
impressed
as
if
they
listened
to
*NL*
an
entire
poem
,
and
when
the
sufferer
is
sincere
they
are
right
in
*NL*
regarding
his
outburst
as
sublime
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
would
be
difficult
to
describe
the
state
of
stupor
in
which
Villefort
*NL*
left
the
Palais
.
Every
pulse
beat
with
feverish
excitement
,
every
nerve
*NL*
was
strained
,
every
vein
swollen
,
and
every
part
of
his
body
seemed
*NL*
to
suffer
distinctly
from
the
rest
,
thus
multiplying
his
agony
a
*NL*
thousand-fold
.
He
made
his
way
along
the
corridors
through
force
of
*NL*
habit
;
he
threw
aside
his
magisterial
robe
,
not
out
of
deference
to
*NL*
etiquette
,
but
because
it
was
an
unbearable
burden
,
a
veritable
garb
*NL*
of
Nessus
,
insatiate
in
torture
.
Having
staggered
as
far
as
the
Rue
*NL*
Dauphine
,
he
perceived
his
carriage
,
awoke
his
sleeping
coachman
by
*NL*
opening
the
door
himself
,
threw
himself
on
the
cushions
,
and
pointed
*NL*
towards
the
Faubourg
Saint-Honore
;
the
carriage
drove
on
.
The
weight
of
*NL*
his
fallen
fortunes
seemed
suddenly
to
crush
him
;
he
could
not
*NL*
foresee
the
consequences
;
he
could
not
contemplate
the
future
with
the
*NL*
indifference
of
the
hardened
criminal
who
merely
faces
a
contingency
*NL*
already
familiar
.
God
was
still
in
his
heart
.
``
God
,
''
he
murmured
,
not
*NL*
knowing
what
he
said
,
--
``
God
--
God
!
''
Behind
the
event
that
had
overwhelmed
*NL*
him
he
saw
the
hand
of
God
.
The
carriage
rolled
rapidly
onward
.
*NL*
Villefort
,
while
turning
restlessly
on
the
cushions
,
felt
something
*NL*
press
against
him
.
He
put
out
his
hand
to
remove
the
object
;
it
was
*NL*
a
fan
which
Madame
de
Villefort
had
left
in
the
carriage
;
this
fan
*NL*
awakened
a
recollection
which
darted
through
his
mind
like
lightning
.
He
*NL*
thought
of
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
he
exclaimed
,
as
though
a
redhot
iron
were
piercing
his
heart
.
*NL*
During
the
last
hour
his
own
crime
had
alone
been
presented
to
his
mind
;
*NL*
now
another
object
,
not
less
terrible
,
suddenly
presented
itself
.
His
*NL*
wife
!
He
had
just
acted
the
inexorable
judge
with
her
,
he
had
condemned
*NL*
her
to
death
,
and
she
,
crushed
by
remorse
,
struck
with
terror
,
*NL*
covered
with
the
shame
inspired
by
the
eloquence
of
his
irreproachable
*NL*
virtue
,
--
she
,
a
poor
,
weak
woman
,
without
help
or
the
power
of
defending
*NL*
herself
against
his
absolute
and
supreme
will
,
--
she
might
at
that
very
*NL*
moment
,
perhaps
,
be
preparing
to
die
!
An
hour
had
elapsed
since
her
*NL*
condemnation
;
at
that
moment
,
doubtless
,
she
was
recalling
all
her
*NL*
crimes
to
her
memory
;
she
was
asking
pardon
for
her
sins
;
perhaps
*NL*
she
was
even
writing
a
letter
imploring
forgiveness
from
her
virtuous
*NL*
husband
--
a
forgiveness
she
was
purchasing
with
her
death
!
Villefort
*NL*
again
groaned
with
anguish
and
despair
.
``
Ah
,
''
he
exclaimed
,
``
that
woman
*NL*
became
criminal
only
from
associating
with
me
!
I
carried
the
infection
*NL*
of
crime
with
me
,
and
she
has
caught
it
as
she
would
the
typhus
fever
,
*NL*
the
cholera
,
the
plague
!
And
yet
I
have
punished
her
--
I
have
dared
to
*NL*
tell
her
--
I
have
--
`
Repent
and
die
!
'
But
no
,
she
must
not
die
;
she
shall
*NL*
live
,
and
with
me
.
We
will
flee
from
Paris
and
go
as
far
as
the
earth
*NL*
reaches
.
I
told
her
of
the
scaffold
;
oh
,
heavens
,
I
forgot
that
it
*NL*
awaits
me
also
!
How
could
I
pronounce
that
word
?
Yes
,
we
will
fly
;
*NL*
I
will
confess
all
to
her
,
--
I
will
tell
her
daily
that
I
also
have
*NL*
committed
a
crime
!
--
Oh
,
what
an
alliance
--
the
tiger
and
the
serpent
;
*NL*
worthy
wife
of
such
as
I
am
!
She
must
live
that
my
infamy
may
diminish
*NL*
hers
.
''
And
Villefort
dashed
open
the
window
in
front
of
the
carriage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Faster
,
faster
!
''
he
cried
,
in
a
tone
which
electrified
the
coachman
.
*NL*
The
horses
,
impelled
by
fear
,
flew
towards
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
''
repeated
Villefort
,
as
he
approached
his
home
--
``
yes
,
that
*NL*
woman
must
live
;
she
must
repent
,
and
educate
my
son
,
the
sole
survivor
,
*NL*
with
the
exception
of
the
indestructible
old
man
,
of
the
wreck
of
*NL*
my
house
.
She
loves
him
;
it
was
for
his
sake
she
has
committed
these
*NL*
crimes
.
We
ought
never
to
despair
of
softening
the
heart
of
a
mother
who
*NL*
loves
her
child
.
She
will
repent
,
and
no
one
will
know
that
she
has
been
*NL*
guilty
.
The
events
which
have
taken
place
in
my
house
,
though
they
now
*NL*
occupy
the
public
mind
,
will
be
forgotten
in
time
,
or
if
,
indeed
,
a
few
*NL*
enemies
should
persist
in
remembering
them
,
why
then
I
will
add
them
to
*NL*
my
list
of
crimes
.
What
will
it
signify
if
one
,
two
,
or
three
more
are
*NL*
added
?
My
wife
and
child
shall
escape
from
this
gulf
,
carrying
treasures
*NL*
with
them
;
she
will
live
and
may
yet
be
happy
,
since
her
child
,
in
whom
*NL*
all
her
love
is
centred
,
will
be
with
her
.
I
shall
have
performed
a
good
*NL*
action
,
and
my
heart
will
be
lighter
.
''
And
the
procureur
breathed
more
*NL*
freely
than
he
had
done
for
some
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
carriage
stopped
at
the
door
of
the
house
.
Villefort
leaped
out
*NL*
of
the
carriage
,
and
saw
that
his
servants
were
surprised
at
his
early
*NL*
return
;
he
could
read
no
other
expression
on
their
features
.
Neither
of
*NL*
them
spoke
to
him
;
they
merely
stood
aside
to
let
him
pass
by
,
as
usual
,
*NL*
nothing
more
.
As
he
passed
by
M.
Noirtier
's
room
,
he
perceived
two
*NL*
figures
through
the
half-open
door
;
but
he
experienced
no
curiosity
to
*NL*
know
who
was
visiting
his
father
:
anxiety
carried
him
on
further
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
''
he
said
,
as
he
ascended
the
stairs
leading
to
his
wife
's
room
,
*NL*
``
nothing
is
changed
here
.
''
He
then
closed
the
door
of
the
landing
.
*NL*
``
No
one
must
disturb
us
,
''
he
said
;
``
I
must
speak
freely
to
her
,
accuse
*NL*
myself
,
and
say
''
--
he
approached
the
door
,
touched
the
crystal
handle
,
*NL*
which
yielded
to
his
hand
.
``
Not
locked
,
''
he
cried
;
``
that
is
well
.
''
And
*NL*
he
entered
the
little
room
in
which
Edward
slept
;
for
though
the
child
*NL*
went
to
school
during
the
day
,
his
mother
could
not
allow
him
to
be
*NL*
separated
from
her
at
night
.
With
a
single
glance
Villefort
's
eye
*NL*
ran
through
the
room
.
``
Not
here
,
''
he
said
;
``
doubtless
she
is
in
her
*NL*
bedroom
.
''
He
rushed
towards
the
door
,
found
it
bolted
,
and
stopped
,
*NL*
shuddering
.
``
Heloise
!
''
he
cried
.
He
fancied
he
heard
the
sound
of
a
*NL*
piece
of
furniture
being
removed
.
``
Heloise
!
''
he
repeated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
there
?
''
answered
the
voice
of
her
he
sought
.
He
thought
that
*NL*
voice
more
feeble
than
usual
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Open
the
door
!
''
cried
Villefort
.
``
Open
;
it
is
I.
''
But
notwithstanding
*NL*
this
request
,
notwithstanding
the
tone
of
anguish
in
which
it
was
*NL*
uttered
,
the
door
remained
closed
.
Villefort
burst
it
open
with
a
*NL*
violent
blow
.
At
the
entrance
of
the
room
which
led
to
her
boudoir
,
*NL*
Madame
de
Villefort
was
standing
erect
,
pale
,
her
features
contracted
,
*NL*
and
her
eyes
glaring
horribly
.
``
Heloise
,
Heloise
!
''
he
said
,
``
what
is
the
*NL*
matter
?
Speak
!
''
The
young
woman
extended
her
stiff
white
hands
towards
*NL*
him
.
``
It
is
done
,
monsieur
,
''
she
said
with
a
rattling
noise
which
seemed
*NL*
to
tear
her
throat
.
``
What
more
do
you
want
?
''
and
she
fell
full
length
on
*NL*
the
floor
.
Villefort
ran
to
her
and
seized
her
hand
,
which
convulsively
*NL*
clasped
a
crystal
bottle
with
a
golden
stopper
.
Madame
de
Villefort
was
*NL*
dead
.
Villefort
,
maddened
with
horror
,
stepped
back
to
the
threshhold
*NL*
of
the
door
,
fixing
his
eyes
on
the
corpse
:
``
My
son
!
''
he
exclaimed
*NL*
suddenly
,
``
where
is
my
son
?
--
Edward
,
Edward
!
''
and
he
rushed
out
of
the
*NL*
room
,
still
crying
,
``
Edward
,
Edward
!
''
The
name
was
pronounced
in
such
a
*NL*
tone
of
anguish
that
the
servants
ran
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
is
my
son
?
''
asked
Villefort
;
``
let
him
be
removed
from
the
house
,
*NL*
that
he
may
not
see
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Master
Edward
is
not
down-stairs
,
sir
,
''
replied
the
valet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
he
must
be
playing
in
the
garden
;
go
and
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
;
Madame
de
Villefort
sent
for
him
half
an
hour
ago
;
he
went
*NL*
into
her
room
,
and
has
not
been
down-stairs
since
.
''
A
cold
perspiration
*NL*
burst
out
on
Villefort
's
brow
;
his
legs
trembled
,
and
his
thoughts
flew
*NL*
about
madly
in
his
brain
like
the
wheels
of
a
disordered
watch
.
``
In
*NL*
Madame
de
Villefort
's
room
?
''
he
murmured
and
slowly
returned
,
with
one
*NL*
hand
wiping
his
forehead
,
and
with
the
other
supporting
himself
*NL*
against
the
wall
.
To
enter
the
room
he
must
again
see
the
body
of
his
*NL*
unfortunate
wife
.
To
call
Edward
he
must
reawaken
the
echo
of
that
room
*NL*
which
now
appeared
like
a
sepulchre
;
to
speak
seemed
like
violating
the
*NL*
silence
of
the
tomb
.
His
tongue
was
paralyzed
in
his
mouth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Edward
!
''
he
stammered
--
``
Edward
!
''
The
child
did
not
answer
.
Where
,
then
,
*NL*
could
he
be
,
if
he
had
entered
his
mother
's
room
and
not
since
returned
?
*NL*
He
stepped
forward
.
The
corpse
of
Madame
de
Villefort
was
stretched
*NL*
across
the
doorway
leading
to
the
room
in
which
Edward
must
be
;
those
*NL*
glaring
eyes
seemed
to
watch
over
the
threshold
,
and
the
lips
bore
the
*NL*
stamp
of
a
terrible
and
mysterious
irony
.
Through
the
open
door
was
*NL*
visible
a
portion
of
the
boudoir
,
containing
an
upright
piano
and
a
blue
*NL*
satin
couch
.
Villefort
stepped
forward
two
or
three
paces
,
and
beheld
*NL*
his
child
lying
--
no
doubt
asleep
--
on
the
sofa
.
The
unhappy
man
uttered
*NL*
an
exclamation
of
joy
;
a
ray
of
light
seemed
to
penetrate
the
abyss
of
*NL*
despair
and
darkness
.
He
had
only
to
step
over
the
corpse
,
enter
the
*NL*
boudoir
,
take
the
child
in
his
arms
,
and
flee
far
,
far
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
Villefort
was
no
longer
the
civilized
man
;
he
was
a
tiger
hurt
unto
*NL*
death
,
gnashing
his
teeth
in
his
wound
.
He
no
longer
feared
realities
,
*NL*
but
phantoms
.
He
leaped
over
the
corpse
as
if
it
had
been
a
burning
*NL*
brazier
.
He
took
the
child
in
his
arms
,
embraced
him
,
shook
him
,
called
*NL*
him
,
but
the
child
made
no
response
.
He
pressed
his
burning
lips
to
the
*NL*
cheeks
,
but
they
were
icy
cold
and
pale
;
he
felt
the
stiffened
limbs
;
he
*NL*
pressed
his
hand
upon
the
heart
,
but
it
no
longer
beat
,
--
the
child
*NL*
was
dead
.
A
folded
paper
fell
from
Edward
's
breast
.
Villefort
,
*NL*
thunderstruck
,
fell
upon
his
knees
;
the
child
dropped
from
his
arms
,
and
*NL*
rolled
on
the
floor
by
the
side
of
its
mother
.
He
picked
up
the
paper
,
*NL*
and
,
recognizing
his
wife
's
writing
,
ran
his
eyes
rapidly
over
its
*NL*
contents
;
it
ran
as
follows
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
that
I
was
a
good
mother
,
since
it
was
for
my
son
's
sake
I
*NL*
became
criminal
.
A
good
mother
can
not
depart
without
her
son
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Villefort
could
not
believe
his
eyes
,
--
he
could
not
believe
his
reason
;
*NL*
he
dragged
himself
towards
the
child
's
body
,
and
examined
it
as
a
*NL*
lioness
contemplates
its
dead
cub
.
Then
a
piercing
cry
escaped
from
his
*NL*
breast
,
and
he
cried
,
``
Still
the
hand
of
God
.
''
The
presence
of
the
*NL*
two
victims
alarmed
him
;
he
could
not
bear
solitude
shared
only
by
two
*NL*
corpses
.
Until
then
he
had
been
sustained
by
rage
,
by
his
strength
of
*NL*
mind
,
by
despair
,
by
the
supreme
agony
which
led
the
Titans
to
scale
the
*NL*
heavens
,
and
Ajax
to
defy
the
gods
.
He
now
arose
,
his
head
bowed
beneath
*NL*
the
weight
of
grief
,
and
,
shaking
his
damp
,
dishevelled
hair
,
he
who
had
*NL*
never
felt
compassion
for
any
one
determined
to
seek
his
father
,
that
he
*NL*
might
have
some
one
to
whom
he
could
relate
his
misfortunes
,
--
some
one
*NL*
by
whose
side
he
might
weep
.
He
descended
the
little
staircase
with
*NL*
which
we
are
acquainted
,
and
entered
Noirtier
's
room
.
The
old
man
*NL*
appeared
to
be
listening
attentively
and
as
affectionately
as
his
*NL*
infirmities
would
allow
to
the
Abbe
Busoni
,
who
looked
cold
and
calm
,
as
*NL*
usual
.
Villefort
,
perceiving
the
abbe
,
passed
his
hand
across
his
*NL*
brow
.
He
recollected
the
call
he
had
made
upon
him
after
the
dinner
at
*NL*
Auteuil
,
and
then
the
visit
the
abbe
had
himself
paid
to
his
house
on
*NL*
the
day
of
Valentine
's
death
.
``
You
here
,
sir
!
''
he
exclaimed
;
``
do
you
,
*NL*
then
,
never
appear
but
to
act
as
an
escort
to
death
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Busoni
turned
around
,
and
,
perceiving
the
excitement
depicted
on
the
*NL*
magistrate
's
face
,
the
savage
lustre
of
his
eyes
,
he
understood
that
*NL*
the
revelation
had
been
made
at
the
assizes
;
but
beyond
this
he
was
*NL*
ignorant
.
``
I
came
to
pray
over
the
body
of
your
daughter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
why
are
you
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
come
to
tell
you
that
you
have
sufficiently
repaid
your
debt
,
and
*NL*
that
from
this
moment
I
will
pray
to
God
to
forgive
you
,
as
I
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
heavens
!
''
exclaimed
Villefort
,
stepping
back
fearfully
,
``
surely
*NL*
that
is
not
the
voice
of
the
Abbe
Busoni
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
!
''
The
abbe
threw
off
his
wig
,
shook
his
head
,
and
his
hair
,
no
*NL*
longer
confined
,
fell
in
black
masses
around
his
manly
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
the
face
of
the
Count
of
Monte
Cristo
!
''
exclaimed
the
procureur
,
*NL*
with
a
haggard
expression
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
not
exactly
right
,
M.
Procureur
;
you
must
go
farther
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
voice
,
that
voice
!
--
where
did
I
first
hear
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
heard
it
for
the
first
time
at
Marseilles
,
twenty-three
years
ago
,
*NL*
the
day
of
your
marriage
with
Mademoiselle
de
Saint-Meran
.
Refer
to
your
*NL*
papers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
not
Busoni
?
--
you
are
not
Monte
Cristo
?
Oh
,
heavens
--
you
are
,
*NL*
then
,
some
secret
,
implacable
,
and
mortal
enemy
!
I
must
have
wronged
you
*NL*
in
some
way
at
Marseilles
.
Oh
,
woe
to
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
you
are
now
on
the
right
path
,
''
said
the
count
,
crossing
his
arms
*NL*
over
his
broad
chest
;
``
search
--
search
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
have
I
done
to
you
?
''
exclaimed
Villefort
,
whose
mind
was
*NL*
balancing
between
reason
and
insanity
,
in
that
cloud
which
is
neither
a
*NL*
dream
nor
reality
;
``
what
have
I
done
to
you
?
Tell
me
,
then
!
Speak
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
condemned
me
to
a
horrible
,
tedious
death
;
you
killed
my
father
;
*NL*
you
deprived
me
of
liberty
,
of
love
,
and
happiness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
are
you
,
then
?
Who
are
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
the
spectre
of
a
wretch
you
buried
in
the
dungeons
of
the
Chateau
*NL*
d'If
.
God
gave
that
spectre
the
form
of
the
Count
of
Monte
Cristo
when
*NL*
he
at
length
issued
from
his
tomb
,
enriched
him
with
gold
and
diamonds
,
*NL*
and
led
him
to
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
I
recognize
you
--
I
recognize
you
!
''
exclaimed
the
king
's
attorney
;
*NL*
``
you
are
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
Edmond
Dantes
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
Edmond
Dantes
,
''
cried
Villefort
,
seizing
the
count
by
the
*NL*
wrist
;
``
then
come
here
!
''
And
up
the
stairs
he
dragged
Monte
Cristo
;
who
,
*NL*
ignorant
of
what
had
happened
,
followed
him
in
astonishment
,
foreseeing
*NL*
some
new
catastrophe
.
``
There
,
Edmond
Dantes
!
''
he
said
,
pointing
to
the
*NL*
bodies
of
his
wife
and
child
,
``
see
,
are
you
well
avenged
?
''
Monte
Cristo
*NL*
became
pale
at
this
horrible
sight
;
he
felt
that
he
had
passed
beyond
*NL*
the
bounds
of
vengeance
,
and
that
he
could
no
longer
say
,
``
God
is
for
*NL*
and
with
me
.
''
With
an
expression
of
indescribable
anguish
he
threw
*NL*
himself
upon
the
body
of
the
child
,
reopened
its
eyes
,
felt
its
*NL*
pulse
,
and
then
rushed
with
him
into
Valentine
's
room
,
of
which
he
*NL*
double-locked
the
door
.
``
My
child
,
''
cried
Villefort
,
``
he
carries
away
*NL*
the
body
of
my
child
!
Oh
,
curses
,
woe
,
death
to
you
!
''
and
he
tried
to
*NL*
follow
Monte
Cristo
;
but
as
though
in
a
dream
he
was
transfixed
to
the
*NL*
spot
,
--
his
eyes
glared
as
though
they
were
starting
through
the
sockets
;
*NL*
he
griped
the
flesh
on
his
chest
until
his
nails
were
stained
with
*NL*
blood
;
the
veins
of
his
temples
swelled
and
boiled
as
though
they
would
*NL*
burst
their
narrow
boundary
,
and
deluge
his
brain
with
living
fire
.
*NL*
This
lasted
several
minutes
,
until
the
frightful
overturn
of
reason
was
*NL*
accomplished
;
then
uttering
a
loud
cry
followed
by
a
burst
of
laughter
,
*NL*
he
rushed
down
the
stairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
quarter
of
an
hour
afterwards
the
door
of
Valentine
's
room
opened
,
and
*NL*
Monte
Cristo
reappeared
.
Pale
,
with
a
dull
eye
and
heavy
heart
,
all
the
*NL*
noble
features
of
that
face
,
usually
so
calm
and
serene
,
were
overcast
*NL*
by
grief
.
In
his
arms
he
held
the
child
,
whom
no
skill
had
been
able
to
*NL*
recall
to
life
.
Bending
on
one
knee
,
he
placed
it
reverently
by
the
side
*NL*
of
its
mother
,
with
its
head
upon
her
breast
.
Then
,
rising
,
he
went
*NL*
out
,
and
meeting
a
servant
on
the
stairs
,
he
asked
,
``
Where
is
M.
de
*NL*
Villefort
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
servant
,
instead
of
answering
,
pointed
to
the
garden
.
Monte
Cristo
*NL*
ran
down
the
steps
,
and
advancing
towards
the
spot
designated
beheld
*NL*
Villefort
,
encircled
by
his
servants
,
with
a
spade
in
his
hand
,
and
*NL*
digging
the
earth
with
fury
.
``
It
is
not
here
!
''
he
cried
.
``
It
is
not
*NL*
here
!
''
And
then
he
moved
farther
on
,
and
began
again
to
dig
.
*NL*
*NL*
Monte
Cristo
approached
him
,
and
said
in
a
low
voice
,
with
an
expression
*NL*
almost
humble
,
``
Sir
,
you
have
indeed
lost
a
son
;
but
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
Villefort
interrupted
him
;
he
had
neither
listened
nor
heard
.
``
Oh
,
I
*NL*
will
find
it
,
''
he
cried
;
``
you
may
pretend
he
is
not
here
,
but
I
will
*NL*
find
him
,
though
I
dig
forever
!
''
Monte
Cristo
drew
back
in
horror
.
``
Oh
,
''
*NL*
he
said
,
``
he
is
mad
!
''
And
as
though
he
feared
that
the
walls
of
the
*NL*
accursed
house
would
crumble
around
him
,
he
rushed
into
the
street
,
for
*NL*
the
first
time
doubting
whether
he
had
the
right
to
do
as
he
had
done
.
*NL*
``
Oh
,
enough
of
this
,
--
enough
of
this
,
''
he
cried
;
``
let
me
save
the
last
.
''
*NL*
On
entering
his
house
,
he
met
Morrel
,
who
wandered
about
like
a
ghost
*NL*
awaiting
the
heavenly
mandate
for
return
to
the
tomb
.
``
Prepare
yourself
,
*NL*
Maximilian
,
''
he
said
with
a
smile
;
``
we
leave
Paris
to-morrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
nothing
more
to
do
there
?
''
asked
Morrel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
replied
Monte
Cristo
;
``
God
grant
I
may
not
have
done
too
much
*NL*
already
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
they
indeed
left
,
accompanied
only
by
Baptistin
.
Haidee
had
*NL*
taken
away
Ali
,
and
Bertuccio
remained
with
Noirtier

Chapter
112
.
The
Departure
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
recent
event
formed
the
theme
of
conversation
throughout
all
Paris
.
*NL*
Emmanuel
and
his
wife
conversed
with
natural
astonishment
in
their
*NL*
little
apartment
in
the
Rue
Meslay
upon
the
three
successive
,
sudden
,
*NL*
and
most
unexpected
catastrophes
of
Morcerf
,
Danglars
,
and
Villefort
.
*NL*
Maximilian
,
who
was
paying
them
a
visit
,
listened
to
their
conversation
,
*NL*
or
rather
was
present
at
it
,
plunged
in
his
accustomed
state
of
apathy
.
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
''
said
Julie
,
``
might
we
not
almost
fancy
,
Emmanuel
,
that
*NL*
those
people
,
so
rich
,
so
happy
but
yesterday
,
had
forgotten
in
their
*NL*
prosperity
that
an
evil
genius
--
like
the
wicked
fairies
in
Perrault
's
*NL*
stories
who
present
themselves
unbidden
at
a
wedding
or
baptism
--
hovered
*NL*
over
them
,
and
appeared
all
at
once
to
revenge
himself
for
their
fatal
*NL*
neglect
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
dire
misfortune
!
''
said
Emmanuel
,
thinking
of
Morcerf
and
*NL*
Danglars
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
dreadful
sufferings
!
''
said
Julie
,
remembering
Valentine
,
but
whom
,
*NL*
with
a
delicacy
natural
to
women
,
she
did
not
name
before
her
brother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
the
Supreme
Being
has
directed
the
fatal
blow
,
''
said
Emmanuel
,
``
it
*NL*
must
be
that
he
in
his
great
goodness
has
perceived
nothing
in
the
past
*NL*
lives
of
these
people
to
merit
mitigation
of
their
awful
punishment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
not
form
a
very
rash
judgment
,
Emmanuel
?
''
said
Julie
.
``
When
my
*NL*
father
,
with
a
pistol
in
his
hand
,
was
once
on
the
point
of
committing
*NL*
suicide
,
had
any
one
then
said
,
`
This
man
deserves
his
misery
,
'
would
*NL*
not
that
person
have
been
deceived
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
but
your
father
was
not
allowed
to
fall
.
A
being
was
commissioned
*NL*
to
arrest
the
fatal
hand
of
death
about
to
descend
on
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Emmanuel
had
scarcely
uttered
these
words
when
the
sound
of
the
bell
*NL*
was
heard
,
the
well-known
signal
given
by
the
porter
that
a
visitor
had
*NL*
arrived
.
Nearly
at
the
same
instant
the
door
was
opened
and
the
Count
of
*NL*
Monte
Cristo
appeared
on
the
threshold
.
The
young
people
uttered
a
*NL*
cry
of
joy
,
while
Maximilian
raised
his
head
,
but
let
it
fall
again
*NL*
immediately
.
``
Maximilian
,
''
said
the
count
,
without
appearing
to
notice
*NL*
the
different
impressions
which
his
presence
produced
on
the
little
*NL*
circle
,
``
I
come
to
seek
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
seek
me
?
''
repeated
Morrel
,
as
if
awakening
from
a
dream
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Monte
Cristo
;
``
has
it
not
been
agreed
that
I
should
take
you
*NL*
with
me
,
and
did
I
not
tell
you
yesterday
to
prepare
for
departure
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
ready
,
''
said
Maximilian
;
``
I
came
expressly
to
wish
them
farewell
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whither
are
you
going
,
count
?
''
asked
Julie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
first
instance
to
Marseilles
,
madame
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
Marseilles
!
''
exclaimed
the
young
couple
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
and
I
take
your
brother
with
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
count
.
''
said
Julie
,
``
will
you
restore
him
to
us
cured
of
his
*NL*
melancholy
?
''
--
Morrel
turned
away
to
conceal
the
confusion
of
his
*NL*
countenance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
perceive
,
then
,
that
he
is
not
happy
?
''
said
the
count
.
``
Yes
,
''
*NL*
replied
the
young
woman
;
``
and
fear
much
that
he
finds
our
home
but
a
*NL*
dull
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
undertake
to
divert
him
,
''
replied
the
count
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
ready
to
accompany
you
,
sir
,
''
said
Maximilian
.
``
Adieu
,
my
kind
*NL*
friends
!
Emmanuel
--
Julie
--
farewell
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
farewell
?
''
exclaimed
Julie
;
``
do
you
leave
us
thus
,
so
suddenly
,
*NL*
without
any
preparations
for
your
journey
,
without
even
a
passport
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Needless
delays
but
increase
the
grief
of
parting
,
''
said
Monte
*NL*
Cristo
,
``
and
Maximilian
has
doubtless
provided
himself
with
everything
*NL*
requisite
;
at
least
,
I
advised
him
to
do
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
a
passport
,
and
my
clothes
are
ready
packed
,
''
said
Morrel
in
his
*NL*
tranquil
but
mournful
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
,
''
said
Monte
Cristo
,
smiling
;
``
in
these
prompt
arrangements
we
*NL*
recognize
the
order
of
a
well-disciplined
soldier
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
leave
us
,
''
said
Julie
,
``
at
a
moment
's
warning
?
you
do
not
give
*NL*
us
a
day
--
no
,
not
even
an
hour
before
your
departure
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
carriage
is
at
the
door
,
madame
,
and
I
must
be
in
Rome
in
five
*NL*
days
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
does
Maximilian
go
to
Rome
?
''
exclaimed
Emmanuel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
going
wherever
it
may
please
the
count
to
take
me
,
''
said
Morrel
,
*NL*
with
a
smile
full
of
grief
;
``
I
am
under
his
orders
for
the
next
month
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
heavens
,
how
strangely
he
expresses
himself
,
count
!
''
said
Julie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Maximilian
goes
with
me
,
''
said
the
count
,
in
his
kindest
and
most
*NL*
persuasive
manner
;
``
therefore
do
not
make
yourself
uneasy
on
your
*NL*
brother
's
account
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Once
more
farewell
,
my
dear
sister
;
Emmanuel
,
adieu
!
''
Morrel
repeated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
His
carelessness
and
indifference
touch
me
to
the
heart
,
''
said
Julie
.
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Maximilian
,
Maximilian
,
you
are
certainly
concealing
something
from
*NL*
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pshaw
!
''
said
Monte
Cristo
,
``
you
will
see
him
return
to
you
gay
,
*NL*
smiling
,
and
joyful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maximilian
cast
a
look
of
disdain
,
almost
of
anger
,
on
the
count
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
must
leave
you
,
''
said
Monte
Cristo
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Before
you
quit
us
,
count
,
''
said
Julie
,
``
will
you
permit
us
to
express
*NL*
to
you
all
that
the
other
day
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madame
,
''
interrupted
the
count
,
taking
her
two
hands
in
his
,
``
all
that
*NL*
you
could
say
in
words
would
never
express
what
I
read
in
your
eyes
;
the
*NL*
thoughts
of
your
heart
are
fully
understood
by
mine
.
Like
benefactors
*NL*
in
romances
,
I
should
have
left
you
without
seeing
you
again
,
but
that
*NL*
would
have
been
a
virtue
beyond
my
strength
,
because
I
am
a
weak
*NL*
and
vain
man
,
fond
of
the
tender
,
kind
,
and
thankful
glances
of
my
*NL*
fellow-creatures
.
On
the
eve
of
departure
I
carry
my
egotism
so
far
as
*NL*
to
say
,
`
Do
not
forget
me
,
my
kind
friends
,
for
probably
you
will
never
*NL*
see
me
again
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
see
you
again
?
''
exclaimed
Emmanuel
,
while
two
large
tears
rolled
*NL*
down
Julie
's
cheeks
,
``
never
behold
you
again
?
It
is
not
a
man
,
then
,
but
*NL*
some
angel
that
leaves
us
,
and
this
angel
is
on
the
point
of
returning
*NL*
to
heaven
after
having
appeared
on
earth
to
do
good
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
not
so
,
''
quickly
returned
Monte
Cristo
--
``
say
not
so
,
my
friends
;
*NL*
angels
never
err
,
celestial
beings
remain
where
they
wish
to
be
.
Fate
is
*NL*
not
more
powerful
than
they
;
it
is
they
who
,
on
the
contrary
,
overcome
*NL*
fate
.
No
,
Emmanuel
,
I
am
but
a
man
,
and
your
admiration
is
as
unmerited
*NL*
as
your
words
are
sacrilegious
.
''
And
pressing
his
lips
on
the
hand
of
*NL*
Julie
,
who
rushed
into
his
arms
,
he
extended
his
other
hand
to
Emmanuel
;
*NL*
then
tearing
himself
from
this
abode
of
peace
and
happiness
,
he
made
a
*NL*
sign
to
Maximilian
,
who
followed
him
passively
,
with
the
indifference
*NL*
which
had
been
perceptible
in
him
ever
since
the
death
of
Valentine
had
*NL*
so
stunned
him
.
``
Restore
my
brother
to
peace
and
happiness
,
''
whispered
*NL*
Julie
to
Monte
Cristo
.
And
the
count
pressed
her
hand
in
reply
,
as
he
*NL*
had
done
eleven
years
before
on
the
staircase
leading
to
Morrel
's
study
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
still
confide
,
then
,
in
Sinbad
the
Sailor
?
''
asked
he
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
''
was
the
ready
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
sleep
in
peace
,
and
put
your
trust
in
heaven
.
''
As
we
have
*NL*
before
said
,
the
postchaise
was
waiting
;
four
powerful
horses
were
*NL*
already
pawing
the
ground
with
impatience
,
while
Ali
,
apparently
just
*NL*
arrived
from
a
long
walk
,
was
standing
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
,
his
*NL*
face
bathed
in
perspiration
.
``
Well
,
''
asked
the
count
in
Arabic
,
``
have
*NL*
you
been
to
see
the
old
man
?
''
Ali
made
a
sign
in
the
affirmative
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
have
you
placed
the
letter
before
him
,
as
I
ordered
you
to
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
slave
respectfully
signalized
that
he
had
.
``
And
what
did
he
say
,
or
*NL*
rather
do
?
''
Ali
placed
himself
in
the
light
,
so
that
his
master
might
*NL*
see
him
distinctly
,
and
then
imitating
in
his
intelligent
manner
the
*NL*
countenance
of
the
old
man
,
he
closed
his
eyes
,
as
Noirtier
was
in
the
*NL*
custom
of
doing
when
saying
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
;
he
accepts
,
''
said
Monte
Cristo
.
``
Now
let
us
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
These
words
had
scarcely
escaped
him
,
when
the
carriage
was
on
its
way
,
*NL*
and
the
feet
of
the
horses
struck
a
shower
of
sparks
from
the
pavement
.
*NL*
Maximilian
settled
himself
in
his
corner
without
uttering
a
word
.
Half
*NL*
an
hour
had
passed
when
the
carriage
stopped
suddenly
;
the
count
had
*NL*
just
pulled
the
silken
check-string
,
which
was
fastened
to
Ali
's
finger
.
*NL*
The
Nubian
immediately
descended
and
opened
the
carriage
door
.
It
was
*NL*
a
lovely
starlight
night
--
they
had
just
reached
the
top
of
the
hill
*NL*
Villejuif
,
from
whence
Paris
appears
like
a
sombre
sea
tossing
its
*NL*
millions
of
phosphoric
waves
into
light
--
waves
indeed
more
noisy
,
more
*NL*
passionate
,
more
changeable
,
more
furious
,
more
greedy
,
than
those
*NL*
of
the
tempestuous
ocean
,
--
waves
which
never
rest
as
those
of
the
sea
*NL*
sometimes
do
,
--
waves
ever
dashing
,
ever
foaming
,
ever
ingulfing
what
*NL*
falls
within
their
grasp
.
The
count
stood
alone
,
and
at
a
sign
from
his
*NL*
hand
,
the
carriage
went
on
for
a
short
distance
.
With
folded
arms
,
he
*NL*
gazed
for
some
time
upon
the
great
city
.
When
he
had
fixed
his
piercing
*NL*
look
on
this
modern
Babylon
,
which
equally
engages
the
contemplation
*NL*
of
the
religious
enthusiast
,
the
materialist
,
and
the
scoffer
,
--
``
Great
*NL*
city
,
''
murmured
he
,
inclining
his
head
,
and
joining
his
hands
as
if
in
*NL*
prayer
,
``
less
than
six
months
have
elapsed
since
first
I
entered
thy
*NL*
gates
.
I
believe
that
the
Spirit
of
God
led
my
steps
to
thee
and
that
he
*NL*
also
enables
me
to
quit
thee
in
triumph
;
the
secret
cause
of
my
presence
*NL*
within
thy
walls
I
have
confided
alone
to
him
who
only
has
had
the
power
*NL*
to
read
my
heart
.
God
only
knows
that
I
retire
from
thee
without
pride
*NL*
or
hatred
,
but
not
without
many
regrets
;
he
only
knows
that
the
power
*NL*
confided
to
me
has
never
been
made
subservient
to
my
personal
good
or
to
*NL*
any
useless
cause
.
Oh
,
great
city
,
it
is
in
thy
palpitating
bosom
that
*NL*
I
have
found
that
which
I
sought
;
like
a
patient
miner
,
I
have
dug
*NL*
deep
into
thy
very
entrails
to
root
out
evil
thence
.
Now
my
work
is
*NL*
accomplished
,
my
mission
is
terminated
,
now
thou
canst
neither
afford
me
*NL*
pain
nor
pleasure
.
Adieu
,
Paris
,
adieu
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
look
wandered
over
the
vast
plain
like
that
of
some
genius
of
the
*NL*
night
;
he
passed
his
hand
over
his
brow
,
got
into
the
carriage
,
the
door
*NL*
was
closed
on
him
,
and
the
vehicle
quickly
disappeared
down
the
other
*NL*
side
of
the
hill
in
a
whirlwind
of
noise
and
dust
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ten
leagues
were
passed
and
not
a
single
word
was
uttered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Morrel
was
dreaming
,
and
Monte
Cristo
was
looking
at
the
dreamer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Morrel
,
''
said
the
count
to
him
at
length
,
``
do
you
repent
having
*NL*
followed
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
count
;
but
to
leave
Paris
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
thought
happiness
might
await
you
in
Paris
,
Morrel
,
I
would
have
*NL*
left
you
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Valentine
reposes
within
the
walls
of
Paris
,
and
to
leave
Paris
is
like
*NL*
losing
her
a
second
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Maximilian
,
''
said
the
count
,
``
the
friends
that
we
have
lost
do
not
*NL*
repose
in
the
bosom
of
the
earth
,
but
are
buried
deep
in
our
hearts
,
and
*NL*
it
has
been
thus
ordained
that
we
may
always
be
accompanied
by
them

I

have
two
friends

in
this
way
never
depart

.
*NL*
Their
spirits
live
in
me
.
I
consult
them
when
doubtful
,
and
if
I
ever
do
*NL*
any
good
,
it
is
due
to
their
beneficent
counsels
.
Listen
to
the
voice
*NL*
of
your
heart
,
Morrel
,
and
ask
it
whether
you
ought
to
preserve
this
*NL*
melancholy
exterior
towards
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
friend
,
''
said
Maximilian
,
``
the
voice
of
my
heart
is
very
sorrowful
,
*NL*
and
promises
me
nothing
but
misfortune
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
the
way
of
weakened
minds
to
see
everything
through
a
black
*NL*
cloud
.
The
soul
forms
its
own
horizons
;
your
soul
is
darkened
,
and
*NL*
consequently
the
sky
of
the
future
appears
stormy
and
unpromising
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
may
possibly
be
true
,
''
said
Maximilian
,
and
he
again
subsided
into
*NL*
his
thoughtful
mood
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
journey
was
performed
with
that
marvellous
rapidity
which
the
*NL*
unlimited
power
of
the
count
ever
commanded
.
Towns
fled
from
them
like
*NL*
shadows
on
their
path
,
and
trees
shaken
by
the
first
winds
of
autumn
*NL*
seemed
like
giants
madly
rushing
on
to
meet
them
,
and
retreating
*NL*
as
rapidly
when
once
reached
.
The
following
morning
they
arrived
at
*NL*
Chalons
,
where
the
count
's
steamboat
waited
for
them
.
Without
the
loss
*NL*
of
an
instant
,
the
carriage
was
placed
on
board
and
the
two
travellers
*NL*
embarked
without
delay
.
The
boat
was
built
for
speed
;
her
two
*NL*
paddle-wheels
were
like
two
wings
with
which
she
skimmed
the
water
like
*NL*
a
bird
.
Morrel
was
not
insensible
to
that
sensation
of
delight
which
is
*NL*
generally
experienced
in
passing
rapidly
through
the
air
,
and
the
wind
*NL*
which
occasionally
raised
the
hair
from
his
forehead
seemed
on
the
point
*NL*
of
dispelling
momentarily
the
clouds
collected
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
distance
increased
between
the
travellers
and
Paris
,
almost
*NL*
superhuman
serenity
appeared
to
surround
the
count
;
he
might
have
been
*NL*
taken
for
an
exile
about
to
revisit
his
native
land
.
Ere
long
Marseilles
*NL*
presented
herself
to
view
,
--
Marseilles
,
white
,
fervid
,
full
of
life
*NL*
and
energy
,
--
Marseilles
,
the
younger
sister
of
Tyre
and
Carthage
,
the
*NL*
successor
to
them
in
the
empire
of
the
Mediterranean
,
--
Marseilles
,
old
,
*NL*
yet
always
young
.
Powerful
memories
were
stirred
within
them
by
the
*NL*
sight
of
the
round
tower
,
Fort
Saint-Nicolas
,
the
City
Hall
designed
*NL*
by
Puget
,
-LSB-
*
-RSB-
the
port
with
its
brick
quays
,
where
they
had
both
played
*NL*
in
childhood
,
and
it
was
with
one
accord
that
they
stopped
on
the
*NL*
Cannebiere
.
A
vessel
was
setting
sail
for
Algiers
,
on
board
of
which
the
*NL*
bustle
usually
attending
departure
prevailed
.
The
passengers
and
their
*NL*
relations
crowded
on
the
deck
,
friends
taking
a
tender
but
sorrowful
*NL*
leave
of
each
other
,
some
weeping
,
others
noisy
in
their
grief
,
the
*NL*
whole
forming
a
spectacle
that
might
be
exciting
even
to
those
who
*NL*
witnessed
similar
sights
daily
,
but
which
had
no
power
to
disturb
the
*NL*
current
of
thought
that
had
taken
possession
of
the
mind
of
Maximilian
*NL*
from
the
moment
he
had
set
foot
on
the
broad
pavement
of
the
quay
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
Pierre
Puget
,
the
sculptor-architect
,
was
born
at
*NL*
Marseilles
in
1622
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
,
''
said
he
,
leaning
heavily
on
the
arm
of
Monte
Cristo
,
--
``
here
is
*NL*
the
spot
where
my
father
stopped
,
when
the
Pharaon
entered
the
port
;
it
*NL*
was
here
that
the
good
old
man
,
whom
you
saved
from
death
and
dishonor
,
*NL*
threw
himself
into
my
arms
.
I
yet
feel
his
warm
tears
on
my
face
,
and
*NL*
his
were
not
the
only
tears
shed
,
for
many
who
witnessed
our
meeting
*NL*
wept
also
.
''
Monte
Cristo
gently
smiled
and
said
,
--
``
I
was
there
;
''
at
the
*NL*
same
time
pointing
to
the
corner
of
a
street
.
As
he
spoke
,
and
in
the
*NL*
very
direction
he
indicated
,
a
groan
,
expressive
of
bitter
grief
,
was
*NL*
heard
,
and
a
woman
was
seen
waving
her
hand
to
a
passenger
on
board
the
*NL*
vessel
about
to
sail
.
Monte
Cristo
looked
at
her
with
an
emotion
that
*NL*
must
have
been
remarked
by
Morrel
had
not
his
eyes
been
fixed
on
the
*NL*
vessel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
heavens
!
''
exclaimed
Morrel
,
``
I
do
not
deceive
myself
--
that
young
*NL*
man
who
is
waving
his
hat
,
that
youth
in
the
uniform
of
a
lieutenant
,
is
*NL*
Albert
de
Morcerf
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Monte
Cristo
,
``
I
recognized
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
so
?
--
you
were
looking
the
other
way
.
''
the
Count
smiled
,
as
he
was
*NL*
in
the
habit
of
doing
when
he
did
not
want
to
make
any
reply
,
and
he
*NL*
again
turned
towards
the
veiled
woman
,
who
soon
disappeared
at
the
*NL*
corner
of
the
street
.
Turning
to
his
friend
,
--
``
Dear
Maximilian
,
''
said
*NL*
the
count
,
``
have
you
nothing
to
do
in
this
land
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
to
weep
over
the
grave
of
my
father
,
''
replied
Morrel
in
a
broken
*NL*
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
go
,
--
wait
for
me
there
,
and
I
will
soon
join
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
leave
me
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
I
also
have
a
pious
visit
to
pay
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Morrel
allowed
his
hand
to
fall
into
that
which
the
count
extended
to
*NL*
him
;
then
with
an
inexpressibly
sorrowful
inclination
of
the
head
he
*NL*
quitted
the
count
and
bent
his
steps
to
the
east
of
the
city
.
Monte
*NL*
Cristo
remained
on
the
same
spot
until
Maximilian
was
out
of
sight
;
he
*NL*
then
walked
slowly
towards
the
Allees
de
Meillan
to
seek
out
a
small
*NL*
house
with
which
our
readers
were
made
familiar
at
the
beginning
of
this
*NL*
story
.
It
yet
stood
,
under
the
shade
of
the
fine
avenue
of
lime-trees
,
*NL*
which
forms
one
of
the
most
frequent
walks
of
the
idlers
of
Marseilles
,
*NL*
covered
by
an
immense
vine
,
which
spreads
its
aged
and
blackened
*NL*
branches
over
the
stone
front
,
burnt
yellow
by
the
ardent
sun
of
the
*NL*
south
.
Two
stone
steps
worn
away
by
the
friction
of
many
feet
led
to
the
*NL*
door
,
which
was
made
of
three
planks
;
the
door
had
never
been
painted
or
*NL*
varnished
,
so
great
cracks
yawned
in
it
during
the
dry
season
to
*NL*
close
again
when
the
rains
came
on
.
The
house
,
with
all
its
crumbling
*NL*
antiquity
and
apparent
misery
,
was
yet
cheerful
and
picturesque
,
and
was
*NL*
the
same
that
old
Dantes
formerly
inhabited
--
the
only
difference
being
*NL*
that
the
old
man
occupied
merely
the
garret
,
while
the
whole
house
was
*NL*
now
placed
at
the
command
of
Mercedes
by
the
count
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
woman
whom
the
count
had
seen
leave
the
ship
with
so
much
regret
*NL*
entered
this
house
;
she
had
scarcely
closed
the
door
after
her
when
*NL*
Monte
Cristo
appeared
at
the
corner
of
a
street
,
so
that
he
found
and
*NL*
lost
her
again
almost
at
the
same
instant
.
The
worn
out
steps
were
old
*NL*
acquaintances
of
his
;
he
knew
better
than
any
one
else
how
to
open
that
*NL*
weather-beaten
door
with
the
large
headed
nail
which
served
to
raise
*NL*
the
latch
within
.
He
entered
without
knocking
,
or
giving
any
other
*NL*
intimation
of
his
presence
,
as
if
he
had
been
a
friend
or
the
master
*NL*
of
the
place
.
At
the
end
of
a
passage
paved
with
bricks
,
was
a
little
*NL*
garden
,
bathed
in
sunshine
,
and
rich
in
warmth
and
light
.
In
this
garden
*NL*
Mercedes
had
found
,
at
the
place
indicated
by
the
count
,
the
sum
of
*NL*
money
which
he
,
through
a
sense
of
delicacy
,
had
described
as
having
*NL*
been
placed
there
twenty-four
years
previously
.
The
trees
of
the
garden
*NL*
were
easily
seen
from
the
steps
of
the
street-door
.
Monte
Cristo
,
on
*NL*
stepping
into
the
house
,
heard
a
sigh
that
was
almost
a
deep
sob
;
he
*NL*
looked
in
the
direction
whence
it
came
,
and
there
under
an
arbor
of
*NL*
Virginia
jessamine
,
-LSB-
*
-RSB-
with
its
thick
foliage
and
beautiful
long
purple
*NL*
flowers
,
he
saw
Mercedes
seated
,
with
her
head
bowed
,
and
weeping
*NL*
bitterly
.
She
had
raised
her
veil
,
and
with
her
face
hidden
by
her
hands
*NL*
was
giving
free
scope
to
the
sighs
and
tears
which
had
been
so
long
*NL*
restrained
by
the
presence
of
her
son
.
Monte
Cristo
advanced
a
few
*NL*
steps
,
which
were
heard
on
the
gravel
.
Mercedes
raised
her
head
,
and
*NL*
uttered
a
cry
of
terror
on
beholding
a
man
before
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
The
Carolina
--
not
Virginia
--
jessamine
,
gelsemium
*NL*
sempervirens
-LRB-
properly
speaking
not
a
jessamine
at
all

*NL*
yellow
blossoms
.
The
reference
is
no
doubt
to
the
Wistaria
*NL*
frutescens
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Madame
,
''
said
the
count
,
``
it
is
no
longer
in
my
power
to
restore
you
to
*NL*
happiness
,
but
I
offer
you
consolation
;
will
you
deign
to
accept
it
as
*NL*
coming
from
a
friend
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
,
indeed
,
most
wretched
,
''
replied
Mercedes
.
``
Alone
in
the
world
,
I
*NL*
had
but
my
son
,
and
he
has
left
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
possesses
a
noble
heart
,
madame

''
replied
the
count
,
``
and
he
has
*NL*
acted
rightly

He
feels
that
every
man
owes
a
tribute
to
his
country

*NL*
some
contribute
their
talents
,
others
their
industry
;
these
devote
their
*NL*
blood
,
those
their
nightly
labors

to
the
same
cause

Had
he
remained
*NL*
with
you
,
his
life
must
have
become
a
hateful
burden
,
nor
would
he
have
*NL*
participated
in
your
griefs
.
He
will
increase
in
strength
and
honor
by
*NL*
struggling
with
adversity
,
which
he
will
convert
into
prosperity
.
*NL*
Leave
him
to
build
up
the
future
for
you

I
venture
to
say
you
will
*NL*
confide
it
to
safe
hands

*NL*
``
Oh

replied
the
wretched
woman
,
mournfully
shaking
her
head
,
``
the
*NL*
prosperity
of
which
you
speak

from

bottom
of

I

pray
God
in
his
mercy

grant
him

The
bitter

The

looked
up

fixed
his

arose

partly
from

extended
both

,
and
God
has
sustained
you
.
But
as
for
me
,
I
have
been
a
*NL*
coward
;
I
have
denied
God
and
he
has
abandoned
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mercedes
burst
into
tears
;
her
woman
's
heart
was
breaking
under
its
load
*NL*
of
memories
.
Monte
Cristo
took
her
hand
and
imprinted
a
kiss
on
it
;
but
*NL*
she
herself
felt
that
it
was
a
kiss
of
no
greater
warmth
than
he
would
*NL*
have
bestowed
on
the
hand
of
some
marble
statue
of
a
saint
.
``
It
often
*NL*
happens
,
''
continued
she
,
``
that
a
first
fault
destroys
the
prospects
of
a
*NL*
whole
life
.
I
believed
you
dead
;
why
did
I
survive
you
?
What
good
has
*NL*
it
done
me
to
mourn
for
you
eternally
in
the
secret
recesses
of
my
*NL*
heart
?
--
only
to
make
a
woman
of
thirty-nine
look
like
a
woman
of
fifty
.
*NL*
Why
,
having
recognized
you
,
and
I
the
only
one
to
do
so
--
why
was
I
able
*NL*
to
save
my
son
alone
?
Ought
I
not
also
to
have
rescued
the
man
that
I
*NL*
had
accepted
for
a
husband
,
guilty
though
he
were
?
Yet
I
let
him
die
!
*NL*
What
do
I
say
?
Oh
,
merciful
heavens
,
was
I
not
accessory
to
his
death
by
*NL*
my
supine
insensibility
,
by
my
contempt
for
him
,
not
remembering
,
or
not
*NL*
willing
to
remember
,
that
it
was
for
my
sake
he
had
become
a
traitor
and
*NL*
a
perjurer
?
In
what
am
I
benefited
by
accompanying
my
son
so
far
,
since
*NL*
I
now
abandon
him
,
and
allow
him
to
depart
alone
to
the
baneful
climate
*NL*
of
Africa
?
Oh
,
I
have
been
base
,
cowardly
,
I
tell
you
;
I
have
abjured
*NL*
my
affections
,
and
like
all
renegades
I
am
of
evil
omen
to
those
who
*NL*
surround
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Mercedes
,
''
said
Monte
Cristo
,
``
no
;
you
judge
yourself
with
too
*NL*
much
severity
.
You
are
a
noble-minded
woman
,
and
it
was
your
grief
*NL*
that
disarmed
me
.
Still
I
was
but
an
agent
,
led
on
by
an
invisible
and
*NL*
offended
Deity
,
who
chose
not
to
withhold
the
fatal
blow
that
I
was
*NL*
destined
to
hurl
.
I
take
that
God
to
witness
,
at
whose
feet
I
have
*NL*
prostrated
myself
daily
for
the
last
ten
years
,
that
I
would
have
*NL*
sacrificed
my
life
to
you
,
and
with
my
life
the
projects
that
were
*NL*
indissolubly
linked
with
it
.
But
--
and
I
say
it
with
some
pride
,
*NL*
Mercedes
--
God
needed
me
,
and
I
lived
.
Examine
the
past
and
the
present
,
*NL*
and
endeavor
to
dive
into
futurity
,
and
then
say
whether
I
am
not
a
*NL*
divine
instrument
.
The
most
dreadful
misfortunes
,
the
most
frightful
*NL*
sufferings
,
the
abandonment
of
all
those
who
loved
me
,
the
persecution
*NL*
of
those
who
did
not
know
me
,
formed
the
trials
of
my
youth
;
when
*NL*
suddenly
,
from
captivity
,
solitude
,
misery
,
I
was
restored
to
light
*NL*
and
liberty
,
and
became
the
possessor
of
a
fortune
so
brilliant
,
*NL*
so
unbounded
,
so
unheard-of
,
that
I
must
have
been
blind
not
to
be
*NL*
conscious
that
God
had
endowed
me
with
it
to
work
out
his
own
great
*NL*
designs
.
From
that
time
I
looked
upon
this
fortune
as
something
confided
*NL*
to
me
for
an
especial
purpose
.
Not
a
thought
was
given
to
a
life
which
*NL*
you
once
,
Mercedes
,
had
the
power
to
render
blissful
;
not
one
hour
*NL*
of
peaceful
calm
was
mine
;
but
I
felt
myself
driven
on
like
an
*NL*
exterminating
angel
.
Like
adventurous
captains
about
to
embark
on
some
*NL*
enterprise
full
of
danger
,
I
laid
in
my
provisions
,
I
loaded
my
weapons
,
*NL*
I
collected
every
means
of
attack
and
defence
;
I
inured
my
body
to
the
*NL*
most
violent
exercises
,
my
soul
to
the
bitterest
trials
;
I
taught
my
*NL*
arm
to
slay
,
my
eyes
to
behold
excruciating
sufferings
,
and
my
mouth
*NL*
to
smile
at
the
most
horrid
spectacles
.
Good-natured
,
confiding
,
and
*NL*
forgiving
as
I
had
been
,
I
became
revengeful
,
cunning
,
and
wicked
,
or
*NL*
rather
,
immovable
as
fate
.
Then
I
launched
out
into
the
path
that
was
*NL*
opened
to
me
.
I
overcame
every
obstacle
,
and
reached
the
goal
;
but
woe
*NL*
to
those
who
stood
in
my
pathway
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Enough

said
Mercedes

``

Believe

dropped

Will

And
after
pressing
her
own
trembling
hand
upon
that
of
the

*NL*
Mercedes
rushed
up
the
stairs
and
disappeared

Monte

slowly
left

the
house
and
turned
towards
the
quay
.
But
Mercedes
did
not
witness
*NL*
his
departure

although
she
was
seated
at
the
little
window
of
the
room
*NL*
which
had
been
occupied
by
old
Dantes

Her
eyes
were
straining
to
see

the
ship
which
was
carrying
her
son
over

vast
sea

Chapter
113
.
The
Past
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
count
departed
with
a
sad
heart
from
the
house
in
which
he
had
left
*NL*
Mercedes
,
probably
never
to
behold
her
again
.
Since
the
death
of
little
*NL*
Edward
a
great
change
had
taken
place
in
Monte
Cristo
.
Having
reached
*NL*
the
summit
of
his
vengeance
by
a
long
and
tortuous
path
,
he
saw
an
abyss
*NL*
of
doubt
yawning
before
him
.
More
than
this
,
the
conversation
which
*NL*
had
just
taken
place
between
Mercedes
and
himself
had
awakened
so
many
*NL*
recollections
in
his
heart
that
he
felt
it
necessary
to
combat
with
*NL*
them
.
A
man
of
the
count
's
temperament
could
not
long
indulge
in
that
*NL*
melancholy
which
can
exist
in
common
minds
,
but
which
destroys
superior
*NL*
ones
.
He
thought
he
must
have
made
an
error
in
his
calculations
if
he
*NL*
now
found
cause
to
blame
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
have
deceived
myself
,
''
he
said
;
``
I
must
look
upon
the
past
in
*NL*
a
false
light
.
What
!
''
he
continued
,
``
can
I
have
been
following
a
false
*NL*
path
?
--
can
the
end
which
I
proposed
be
a
mistaken
end
?
--
can
one
hour
*NL*
have
sufficed
to
prove
to
an
architect
that
the
work
upon
which
*NL*
he
founded
all
his
hopes
was
an
impossible
,
if
not
a
sacrilegious
,
*NL*
undertaking
?
I
can
not
reconcile
myself
to
this
idea
--
it
would
madden
*NL*
me
.
The
reason
why
I
am
now
dissatisfied
is
that
I
have
not
a
clear
*NL*
appreciation
of
the
past
.
The
past
,
like
the
country
through
which
we
*NL*
walk
,
becomes
indistinct
as
we
advance
.
My
position
is
like
that
of
*NL*
a
person
wounded
in
a
dream
;
he
feels
the
wound
,
though
he
can
not
*NL*
recollect
when
he
received
it
.
Come
,
then
,
thou
regenerate
man
,
*NL*
thou
extravagant
prodigal
,
thou
awakened
sleeper
,
thou
all-powerful
*NL*
visionary
,
thou
invincible
millionaire
,
--
once
again
review
thy
past
*NL*
life
of
starvation
and
wretchedness
,
revisit
the
scenes
where
fate
*NL*
and
misfortune
conducted
,
and
where
despair
received
thee
.
Too
many
*NL*
diamonds
,
too
much
gold
and
splendor
,
are
now
reflected
by
the
mirror
in
*NL*
which
Monte
Cristo
seeks
to
behold
Dantes
.
Hide
thy
diamonds
,
bury
thy
*NL*
gold
,
shroud
thy
splendor
,
exchange
riches
for
poverty
,
liberty
for
a
*NL*
prison
,
a
living
body
for
a
corpse
!
''
As
he
thus
reasoned
,
Monte
Cristo
*NL*
walked
down
the
Rue
de
la
Caisserie
.
It
was
the
same
through
which
,
*NL*
twenty-four
years
ago
,
he
had
been
conducted
by
a
silent
and
nocturnal
*NL*
guard
;
the
houses
,
to-day
so
smiling
and
animated
,
were
on
that
night
*NL*
dark
,
mute
,
and
closed
.
``
And
yet
they
were
the
same
,
''
murmured
Monte
*NL*
Cristo
,
``
only
now
it
is
broad
daylight
instead
of
night
;
it
is
the
sun
*NL*
which
brightens
the
place
,
and
makes
it
appear
so
cheerful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
proceeded
towards
the
quay
by
the
Rue
Saint-Laurent
,
and
advanced
to
*NL*
the
Consigne
;
it
was
the
point
where
he
had
embarked
.
A
pleasure-boat
*NL*
with
striped
awning
was
going
by
.
Monte
Cristo
called
the
owner
,
who
*NL*
immediately
rowed
up
to
him
with
the
eagerness
of
a
boatman
hoping
for
a
*NL*
good
fare
.
The
weather
was
magnificent
,
and
the
excursion
a
treat
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sun
,
red
and
flaming
,
was
sinking
into
the
embrace
of
the
welcoming
*NL*
ocean
.
The
sea
,
smooth
as
crystal
,
was
now
and
then
disturbed
by
the
*NL*
leaping
of
fish
,
which
were
pursued
by
some
unseen
enemy
and
sought
for
*NL*
safety
in
another
element
;
while
on
the
extreme
verge
of
the
horizon
*NL*
might
be
seen
the
fishermen
's
boats
,
white
and
graceful
as
the
sea-gull
,
*NL*
or
the
merchant
vessels
bound
for
Corsica
or
Spain
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
notwithstanding
the
serene
sky
,
the
gracefully
formed
boats
,
and
*NL*
the
golden
light
in
which
the
whole
scene
was
bathed
,
the
Count
of
Monte
*NL*
Cristo
,
wrapped
in
his
cloak
,
could
think
only
of
this
terrible
voyage
,
*NL*
the
details
of
which
were
one
by
one
recalled
to
his
memory
.
The
*NL*
solitary
light
burning
at
the
Catalans
;
that
first
sight
of
the
Chateau
*NL*
d'If
,
which
told
him
whither
they
were
leading
him
;
the
struggle
with
*NL*
the
gendarmes
when
he
wished
to
throw
himself
overboard
;
his
despair
*NL*
when
he
found
himself
vanquished
,
and
the
sensation
when
the
muzzle
of
*NL*
the
carbine
touched
his
forehead
--
all
these
were
brought
before
him
*NL*
in
vivid
and
frightful
reality
.
Like
the
streams
which
the
heat
of
the
*NL*
summer
has
dried
up
,
and
which
after
the
autumnal
storms
gradually
begin
*NL*
oozing
drop
by
drop
,
so
did
the
count
feel
his
heart
gradually
fill
with
*NL*
the
bitterness
which
formerly
nearly
overwhelmed
Edmond
Dantes
.
Clear
*NL*
sky
,
swift-flitting
boats
,
and
brilliant
sunshine
disappeared
;
the
*NL*
heavens
were
hung
with
black
,
and
the
gigantic
structure
of
the
Chateau
*NL*
d'If
seemed
like
the
phantom
of
a
mortal
enemy
.
As
they
reached
the
*NL*
shore
,
the
count
instinctively
shrunk
to
the
extreme
end
of
the
boat
,
*NL*
and
the
owner
was
obliged
to
call
out
,
in
his
sweetest
tone
of
voice
,
*NL*
``
Sir
,
we
are
at
the
landing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Monte
Cristo
remembered
that
on
that
very
spot
,
on
the
same
rock
,
he
had
*NL*
been
violently
dragged
by
the
guards
,
who
forced
him
to
ascend
the
slope
*NL*
at
the
points
of
their
bayonets
.
The
journey
had
seemed
very
long
to
*NL*
Dantes
,
but
Monte
Cristo
found
it
equally
short
.
Each
stroke
of
the
oar
*NL*
seemed
to
awaken
a
new
throng
of
ideas
,
which
sprang
up
with
the
flying
*NL*
spray
of
the
sea
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
had
been
no
prisoners
confined
in
the
Chateau
d'If
since
the
*NL*
revolution
of
July
;
it
was
only
inhabited
by
a
guard
,
kept
there
for
the
*NL*
prevention
of
smuggling
.
A
concierge
waited
at
the
door
to
exhibit
to
*NL*
visitors
this
monument
of
curiosity
,
once
a
scene
of
terror
.
The
count
*NL*
inquired
whether
any
of
the
ancient
jailers
were
still
there
;
but
they
*NL*
had
all
been
pensioned
,
or
had
passed
on
to
some
other
employment
.
The
*NL*
concierge
who
attended
him
had
only
been
there
since
1830
.
He
visited
*NL*
his
own
dungeon
.
He
again
beheld
the
dull
light
vainly
endeavoring
to
*NL*
penetrate
the
narrow
opening
.
His
eyes
rested
upon
the
spot
where
had
*NL*
stood
his
bed
,
since
then
removed
,
and
behind
the
bed
the
new
stones
*NL*
indicated
where
the
breach
made
by
the
Abbe
Faria
had
been
.
Monte
Cristo
*NL*
felt
his
limbs
tremble
;
he
seated
himself
upon
a
log
of
wood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
there
any
stories
connected
with
this
prison
besides
the
one
*NL*
relating
to
the
poisoning
of
Mirabeau
?
''
asked
the
count
;
``
are
there
any
*NL*
traditions
respecting
these
dismal
abodes
,
--
in
which
it
is
difficult
to
*NL*
believe
men
can
ever
have
imprisoned
their
fellow-creatures
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
;
indeed
,
the
jailer
Antoine
told
me
one
connected
with
this
*NL*
very
dungeon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Monte
Cristo
shuddered
;
Antoine
had
been
his
jailer
.
He
had
almost
*NL*
forgotten
his
name
and
face
,
but
at
the
mention
of
the
name
he
recalled
*NL*
his
person
as
he
used
to
see
it
,
the
face
encircled
by
a
beard
,
wearing
*NL*
the
brown
jacket
,
the
bunch
of
keys
,
the
jingling
of
which
he
still
*NL*
seemed
to
hear
.
The
count
turned
around
,
and
fancied
he
saw
him
in
the
*NL*
corridor
,
rendered
still
darker
by
the
torch
carried
by
the
concierge
.
*NL*
``
Would
you
like
to
hear
the
story
,
sir
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
relate
it
,
''
said
Monte
Cristo
,
pressing
his
hand
to
his
heart
to
*NL*
still
its
violent
beatings
;
he
felt
afraid
of
hearing
his
own
history
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
dungeon
,
''
said
the
concierge
,
``
was
,
it
appears
,
some
time
ago
*NL*
occupied
by
a
very
dangerous
prisoner
,
the
more
so
since
he
was
full
of
*NL*
industry
.
Another
person
was
confined
in
the
Chateau
at
the
same
time
,
*NL*
but
he
was
not
wicked
,
he
was
only
a
poor
mad
priest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
indeed
?
--
mad
!
''
repeated
Monte
Cristo
;
``
and
what
was
his
mania
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
offered
millions
to
any
one
who
would
set
him
at
liberty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Monte
Cristo
raised
his
eyes
,
but
he
could
not
see
the
heavens
;
there
*NL*
was
a
stone
veil
between
him
and
the
firmament
.
He
thought
that
there
*NL*
had
been
no
less
thick
a
veil
before
the
eyes
of
those
to
whom
Faria
*NL*
offered
the
treasures
.
``
Could
the
prisoners
see
each
other
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
sir
,
it
was
expressly
forbidden
;
but
they
eluded
the
vigilance
*NL*
of
the
guards
,
and
made
a
passage
from
one
dungeon
to
the
other
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
which
of
them
made
this
passage
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it
must
have
been
the
young
man
,
certainly
,
for
he
was
strong
and
*NL*
industrious
,
while
the
abbe
was
aged
and
weak
;
besides
,
his
mind
was
too
*NL*
vacillating
to
allow
him
to
carry
out
an
idea
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Blind
fools
!
''
murmured
the
count
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
However
,
be
that
as
it
may
,
the
young
man
made
a
tunnel
,
how
or
by
*NL*
what
means
no
one
knows
;
but
he
made
it
,
and
there
is
the
evidence
yet
*NL*
remaining
of
his
work
.
Do
you
see
it
?
''
and
the
man
held
the
torch
to
the
*NL*
wall
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
yes
;
I
see
,
''
said
the
count
,
in
a
voice
hoarse
from
emotion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
result
was
that
the
two
men
communicated
with
one
another
;
how
long
*NL*
they
did
so
,
nobody
knows
.
One
day
the
old
man
fell
ill
and
died
.
Now
*NL*
guess
what
the
young
one
did
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
carried
off
the
corpse
,
which
he
placed
in
his
own
bed
with
its
face
*NL*
to
the
wall
;
then
he
entered
the
empty
dungeon
,
closed
the
entrance
,
and
*NL*
slipped
into
the
sack
which
had
contained
the
dead
body
.
Did
you
ever
*NL*
hear
of
such
an
idea
?
''
Monte
Cristo
closed
his
eyes
,
and
seemed
again
*NL*
to
experience
all
the
sensations
he
had
felt
when
the
coarse
canvas
,
*NL*
yet
moist
with
the
cold
dews
of
death
,
had
touched
his
face
.
The
jailer
*NL*
continued
:
``
Now
this
was
his
project
.
He
fancied
that
they
buried
the
*NL*
dead
at
the
Chateau
d'If
,
and
imagining
they
would
not
expend
much
labor
*NL*
on
the
grave
of
a
prisoner
,
he
calculated
on
raising
the
earth
with
*NL*
his
shoulders
,
but
unfortunately
their
arrangements
at
the
Chateau
*NL*
frustrated
his
projects
.
They
never
buried
the
dead
;
they
merely
*NL*
attached
a
heavy
cannon-ball
to
the
feet
,
and
then
threw
them
into
the
*NL*
sea
.
This
is
what
was
done
.
The
young
man
was
thrown
from
the
top
of
the
*NL*
rock
;
the
corpse
was
found
on
the
bed
next
day
,
and
the
whole
truth
was
*NL*
guessed
,
for
the
men
who
performed
the
office
then
mentioned
what
they
*NL*
had
not
dared
to
speak
of
before
,
that
at
the
moment
the
corpse
was
*NL*
thrown
into
the
deep
,
they
heard
a
shriek
,
which
was
almost
immediately
*NL*
stifled
by
the
water
in
which
it
disappeared
.
''
The
count
breathed
with
*NL*
difficulty
;
the
cold
drops
ran
down
his
forehead
,
and
his
heart
was
full
*NL*
of
anguish
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
he
muttered
,
``
the
doubt
I
felt
was
but
the
commencement
of
*NL*
forgetfulness
;
but
here
the
wound
reopens
,
and
the
heart
again
thirsts
*NL*
for
vengeance
.
And
the
prisoner
,
''
he
continued
aloud
,
``
was
he
ever
heard
*NL*
of
afterwards
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
;
of
course
not
.
You
can
understand
that
one
of
two
things
must
*NL*
have
happened
;
he
must
either
have
fallen
flat
,
in
which
case
the
blow
,
*NL*
from
a
height
of
ninety
feet
,
must
have
killed
him
instantly
,
or
he
must
*NL*
have
fallen
upright
,
and
then
the
weight
would
have
dragged
him
to
the
*NL*
bottom
,
where
he
remained
--
poor
fellow
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
pity
him
?
''
said
the
count
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ma
foi
,
yes
;
though
he
was
in
his
own
element
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
report
was
that
he
had
been
a
naval
officer
,
who
had
been
confined
*NL*
for
plotting
with
the
Bonapartists
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Great
is
truth
,
''
muttered
the
count
,
``
fire
can
not
burn
,
nor
water
drown
*NL*
it
!
Thus
the
poor
sailor
lives
in
the
recollection
of
those
who
narrate
*NL*
his
history
;
his
terrible
story
is
recited
in
the
chimney-corner
,
and
a
*NL*
shudder
is
felt
at
the
description
of
his
transit
through
the
air
to
be
*NL*
swallowed
by
the
deep
.
''
Then
,
the
count
added
aloud
,
``
Was
his
name
ever
*NL*
known
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
;
but
only
as
No.

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Villefort
,
Villefort

murmured
the
count
,
``
this
scene
must
often
*NL*
have
haunted
thy
sleepless
hours
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
wish
to
see
anything
more

said
the
concierge

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

if
you
will
show

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

No.
27

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
No.
27
.
''
repeated
the
count
,
who
seemed
to
hear
the
voice
of
the
*NL*
abbe
answering
him
in
those
very
words
through
the
wall
when
asked
his
*NL*
name
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait
,
''
said
Monte
Cristo
,
``
I
wish
to
take
one
final
glance
around
this
*NL*
room
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
fortunate
,
''
said
the
guide
;
``
I
have
forgotten
the
other
key

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
and
fetch
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
leave
you
the
torch

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

No.

They
said
he
was
so
accustomed
to
darkness
*NL*
that
he
could
see
a
pin
in
the
darkest
corner
of
his
dungeon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
spent
fourteen
years
to
arrive
at
that
,
''
muttered
the
count
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
guide
carried
away
the
torch
.
The
count
had
spoken
correctly
.
*NL*
Scarcely
had
a
few
seconds
elapsed
,
ere
he
saw
everything
as
distinctly
*NL*
as
by
daylight
.
Then
he
looked
around
him
,
and
really
recognized
his
*NL*
dungeon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
he
said
,
``
there
is
the
stone
upon
which
I
used
to
sit
;
there
is
*NL*
the
impression
made
by
my
shoulders
on
the
wall
;
there
is
the
mark
of
*NL*
my
blood
made
when
one
day
I
dashed
my
head
against
the
wall
.
Oh
,
those
*NL*
figures
,
how
well
I
remember
them
!
I
made
them
one
day
to
calculate
*NL*
the
age
of
my
father
,
that
I
might
know
whether
I
should
find
him
still
*NL*
living
,
and
that
of
Mercedes
,
to
know
if
I
should
find
her
still
free
.
*NL*
After
finishing
that
calculation
,
I
had
a
minute
's
hope
.
I
did
not
*NL*
reckon
upon
hunger
and
infidelity
!
''
and
a
bitter
laugh
escaped
the
*NL*
count
.
He
saw
in
fancy
the
burial
of
his
father
,
and
the
marriage
of
*NL*
Mercedes
.
On
the
other
side
of
the
dungeon
he
perceived
an
inscription
,
*NL*
the
white
letters
of
which
were
still
visible
on
the
green
wall
.
''
'
O
*NL*
God
,
'
''
he
read
,
''
`
preserve
my
memory
!
'
Oh
,
yes
,
''
he
cried
,
``
that
was
*NL*
my
only
prayer
at
last
;
I
no
longer
begged
for
liberty
,
but
memory
;
*NL*
I
dreaded
to
become
mad
and
forgetful
.
O
God
,
thou
hast
preserved
my
*NL*
memory
;
I
thank
thee
,
I
thank
thee
!
''
At
this
moment
the
light
of
the
*NL*
torch
was
reflected
on
the
wall
;
the
guide
was
coming
;
Monte
Cristo
went
*NL*
to
meet
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Follow
me
,
sir
;
''
and
without
ascending
the
stairs
the
guide
conducted
*NL*
him
by
a
subterraneous
passage
to
another
entrance
.
There
,
again
,
Monte
*NL*
Cristo
was
assailed
by
a
multitude
of
thoughts
.
The
first
thing
that
*NL*
met
his
eye
was
the
meridian
,
drawn
by
the
abbe
on
the
wall
,
by
which
*NL*
he
calculated
the
time
;
then
he
saw
the
remains
of
the
bed
on
which
*NL*
the
poor
prisoner
had
died
.
The
sight
of
this
,
instead
of
exciting
the
*NL*
anguish
experienced
by
the
count
in
the
dungeon
,
filled
his
heart
with
a
*NL*
soft
and
grateful
sentiment
,
and
tears
fell
from
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
where
the
mad
abbe
was
kept
,
sir
,
and
that
is
where
the
young
*NL*
man
entered
;
''
and
the
guide
pointed
to
the
opening
,
which
had
remained
*NL*
unclosed
.
``
From
the
appearance
of
the
stone
,
''
he
continued
,
``
a
learned
*NL*
gentleman
discovered
that
the
prisoners
might
have
communicated
together
*NL*
for
ten
years
.
Poor
things
!
Those
must
have
been
ten
weary
years

Dantes
took
some
louis
from
his
pocket
,
and
gave
them
to
the
man
who
*NL*
had
twice
unconsciously
pitied
him
.
The
guide
took
them
,
thinking
them
*NL*
merely
a
few
pieces
of
little
value
;
but
the
light
of
the
torch
revealed
*NL*
their
true
worth
.
``
Sir

he
said

``
you

gold

*NL*

The
concierge
looked
upon
the
count
with
surprise
.
``
Sir
,

*NL*
he
cried
,
scarcely
able
to
believe
his
good
fortune

``
sir

I
can
not
*NL*
understand
your
generosity

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

it

very
simple

my

I
have

your

touched
me
more
than
it

others

*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
sir

since
you
are
so
liberal

I
ought
to
offer
you
something

*NL*
``
What

No

*NL*
``

the

always
left

I
began

sound
the

*NL*
``
Ah

cried
Monte
Cristo
,
remembering
the
abbe

two
hiding-places

*NL*
*NL*
``
After
some
search

I
found

at
the
hearth

astonishment

*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

sold

great

curiosities

I
have
still
something
left

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
asked
the
count
,
impatiently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
sort
of
book
,
written
upon
strips
of
cloth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
and
fetch
it
,
my
good

and
if
it
be
what
I
hope

you
will
do
*NL*
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
run
for
it
,
sir
;
''
and
the
guide
went
out
.
Then
the
count
knelt
*NL*
down
by
the
side
of
the
bed
,
which
death
had
converted
into
an
altar
.
*NL*
``
Oh
,
second
father
,
''
he
exclaimed
,
``
thou
who
hast
given
me
liberty
,
*NL*
knowledge
,
riches
;
thou
who
,
like
beings
of
a
superior
order
to
*NL*
ourselves
,
couldst
understand
the
science
of
good
and
evil
;
if
in
the
*NL*
depths
of
the
tomb
there
still
remain
something
within
us
which
can
*NL*
respond
to
the
voice
of
those
who
are
left
on
earth
;
if
after
death
the
*NL*
soul
ever
revisit
the
places
where
we
have
lived
and
suffered
,
--
then
,
*NL*
noble
heart
,
sublime
soul
,
then
I
conjure
thee
by
the
paternal
love
thou
*NL*
didst
bear
me
,
by
the
filial
obedience
I
vowed
to
thee
,
grant
me
some
*NL*
sign
,
some
revelation
!
Remove
from
me
the
remains
of
doubt
,
which
,
if
*NL*
it
change
not
to
conviction
,
must
become
remorse

''
The
count
bowed
his
*NL*
head
,
and
clasped
his
hands
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
,
sir
,
''
said
a
voice
behind
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Monte
Cristo
shuddered
,
and
arose
.
The
concierge
held
out
the
strips
of
*NL*
cloth
upon
which
the
Abbe
Faria
had
spread
the
riches
of
his
mind
.
The
*NL*
manuscript
was
the
great
work
by
the
Abbe
Faria
upon
the
kingdoms
of
*NL*
Italy
.
The
count
seized
it
hastily
,
his
eyes
immediately
fell
upon
the
*NL*
epigraph
,
and
he
read
,
''
`
Thou
shalt
tear
out
the
dragons
'
teeth
,
and
*NL*
shall
trample
the
lions
under
foot
,
saith
the
Lord
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
he
exclaimed
,
``
here
is
my
answer
.
Thanks
,
father
,
thanks
.
''
*NL*
And
feeling
in
his
pocket
,
he
took
thence
a
small
pocket-book
,
which
*NL*
contained
ten
bank-notes
,
each
of
1,000
.
francs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
,
''
he
said
,
``
take
this
pocket-book
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
give
it
to
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
but
only
on
condition
that
you
will
not
open
it
till
I
am
gone
;
''
*NL*
and
placing
in
his
breast
the
treasure
he
had
just
found
,
which
was
more
*NL*
valuable
to
him
than
the
richest
jewel
,
he
rushed
out
of
the
corridor
,
*NL*
and
reaching
his
boat
,
cried
,
``
To
Marseilles
!
''
Then
,
as
he
departed
,
he
*NL*
fixed
his
eyes
upon
the
gloomy
prison
.
``
Woe
,
''
he
cried
,
``
to
those
who
*NL*
confined
me
in
that
wretched
prison
;
and
woe
to
those
who
forgot
that
*NL*
I
was
there
!
''
As
he
repassed
the
Catalans
,
the
count
turned
around
and
*NL*
burying
his
head
in
his
cloak
murmured
the
name
of
a
woman
.
The
victory
*NL*
was
complete
;
twice
he
had
overcome
his
doubts
.
The
name
he
pronounced
,
*NL*
in
a
voice
of
tenderness
,
amounting
almost
to
love
,
was
that
of
Haidee
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
landing
,
the
count
turned
towards
the
cemetery
,
where
he
felt
sure
of
*NL*
finding
Morrel
.
He
,
too
,
ten
years
ago
,
had
piously
sought
out
a
tomb
,
*NL*
and
sought
it
vainly
.
He
,
who
returned
to
France
with
millions
,
had
been
*NL*
unable
to
find
the
grave
of
his
father
,
who
had
perished
from
hunger
.
*NL*
Morrel
had
indeed
placed
a
cross
over
the
spot
,
but
it
had
fallen
down
*NL*
and
the
grave-digger
had
burnt
it
,
as
he
did
all
the
old
wood
in
the
*NL*
churchyard
.
The
worthy
merchant
had
been
more
fortunate
.
Dying
in
the
*NL*
arms
of
his
children
,
he
had
been
by
them
laid
by
the
side
of
his
*NL*
wife
,
who
had
preceded
him
in
eternity
by
two
years
.
Two
large
slabs
of
*NL*
marble
,
on
which
were
inscribed
their
names
,
were
placed
on
either
side
*NL*
of
a
little
enclosure
,
railed
in
,
and
shaded
by
four
cypress-trees
.
*NL*
Morrel
was
leaning
against
one
of
these
,
mechanically
fixing
his
eyes
*NL*
on
the
graves
.
His
grief
was
so
profound
that
he
was
nearly
unconscious
.
*NL*
``
Maximilian
,
''
said
the
count
,
``
you
should
not
look
on
the
graves
,
but
*NL*
there
;
''
and
he
pointed
upwards
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
dead
are
everywhere
,
''
said
Morrel
;
``
did
you
not
yourself
tell
me
so
*NL*
as
we
left
Paris
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Maximilian
,
''
said
the
count
,
``
you
asked
me
during
the
journey
to
allow
*NL*
you
to
remain
some
days
at
Marseilles
.
Do
you
still
wish
to
do
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
no
wishes

only
I
fancy
I
could
pass
the
time
less
*NL*
painfully
here
than
anywhere
else

*NL*
*NL*
``
So
much
the
better

I

leave

not

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

I
shall

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

you
will
not
forget
it

because
you
are
a
man
of
honor

Morrel

you
have
taken
an
oath
,
and
are
about
to
do
so
again

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

count

have
pity
upon
me
.
I
am
so
unhappy

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
known
a
man
much
more
unfortunate
than

Morrel

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Impossible
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas

''
said
Monte
Cristo
,
``
it
is
the
infirmity
of
our
nature
always
to
*NL*
believe
ourselves
much
more
unhappy
than
those
who
groan
by
our
sides
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
can
be
more
wretched
than
the
man

lost
all
he
loved

*NL*
desired
in

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
,
Morrel
,
and
pay
attention
to
what
I
am
about
to
tell
you

I
*NL*
knew
a
man
who
like
you
had
fixed
all
his
hopes
of
happiness
upon
a
*NL*
woman
.
He
was
young
,
he
had
an
old
father
whom
he
loved
,
a
betrothed
*NL*
bride
whom
he
adored
.
He
was
about
to
marry
her
,
when
one
of
the
*NL*
caprices
of
fate
,
--
which
would
almost
make
us
doubt
the
goodness
of
*NL*
providence
,
if
that
providence
did
not
afterwards
reveal
itself
by
*NL*
proving
that
all
is
but
a
means
of
conducting
to
an
end
,
--
one
of
those
*NL*
caprices
deprived
him
of
his
mistress
,
of
the
future
of
which
he
had
*NL*
dreamed
-LRB-
for
in
his
blindness
he
forgot
he
could
only
read
the
present
-RRB-
,
*NL*
and
cast
him
into
a
dungeon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
said
Morrel
,
``
one
quits
a
dungeon
in
a
week
,
a
month
,
or
a
year
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
remained
there
fourteen
years
,
Morrel

''
said
the
count
,
placing
his
*NL*
hand
on
the
young
man
's
shoulder
.
Maximilian
shuddered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fourteen
years
!
''
he
muttered
--
``
Fourteen
years
!
''
repeated
the
count
.
*NL*
``
During
that
time
he
had
many
moments
of
despair

He
also
,
Morrel
,
like
*NL*
you
,
considered
himself
the
unhappiest
of
men

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

asked
Morrel

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

at
the
height
of
his
despair

assisted
him

At

perhaps

he
did
not
recognize
the
infinite
mercy
of
the
*NL*
Lord
,
but
at
last
he
took
patience
and
waited
.
One
day
he
miraculously
*NL*
left
the
prison
,
transformed
,
rich
,
powerful
.
His
first
cry
was
for
his
*NL*
father

that

was
dead

``
My

The

ascending

soon
disappeared

*NL*
little
town
of
Aquapendente
.
He
was
travelling
fast
enough
to
cover
a
*NL*
great
deal
of
ground
without
exciting
suspicion
.
This
man
was
dressed
*NL*
in
a
greatcoat
,
or
rather
a
surtout
,
a
little
worse
for
the
journey
,
*NL*
but
which
exhibited
the
ribbon
of
the
Legion
of
Honor
still
fresh
and
*NL*
brilliant
,
a
decoration
which
also
ornamented
the
under
coat
.
He
might
*NL*
be
recognized
,
not
only
by
these
signs
,
but
also
from
the
accent
with
*NL*
which
he
spoke
to
the
postilion
,
as
a
Frenchman
.
Another
proof
that
he
*NL*
was
a
native
of
the
universal
country
was
apparent
in
the
fact
of
his
*NL*
knowing
no
other
Italian
words
than
the
terms
used
in
music
,
and
*NL*
which
like
the
``
goddam
''
of
Figaro
,
served
all
possible
linguistic
*NL*
requirements
.
``
Allegro
!
''
he
called
out
to
the
postilions
at
every
*NL*
ascent
.
``
Moderato
!
''
he
cried
as
they
descended
.
And
heaven
knows
there
*NL*
are
hills
enough
between
Rome
and
Florence
by
the
way
of
Aquapendente
!
*NL*
These
two
words
greatly
amused
the
men
to
whom
they
were
addressed
.
On
*NL*
reaching
La
Storta
,
the
point
from
whence
Rome
is
first
visible
,
the
*NL*
traveller
evinced
none
of
the
enthusiastic
curiosity
which
usually
leads
*NL*
strangers
to
stand
up
and
endeavor
to
catch
sight
of
the
dome
of
*NL*
St.
Peter
's
,
which
may
be
seen
long
before
any
other
object
is
*NL*
distinguishable
.
No
,
he
merely
drew
a
pocketbook
from
his
pocket
,
and
*NL*
took
from
it
a
paper
folded
in
four
,
and
after
having
examined
it
in
a
*NL*
manner
almost
reverential
,
he
said
--
``
Good
!
I
have
it
still
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
carriage
entered
by
the
Porto
del
Popolo
,
turned
to
the
left
,
and
*NL*
stopped
at
the
Hotel
d'Espagne
.
Old
Pastrini
,
our
former
acquaintance
,
*NL*
received
the
traveller
at
the
door
,
hat
in
hand
.
The
traveller
alighted
,
*NL*
ordered
a
good
dinner
,
and
inquired
the
address
of
the
house
of
Thomson
*NL*
&
French
,
which
was
immediately
given
to
him
,
as
it
was
one
of
the
most
*NL*
celebrated
in
Rome
.
It
was
situated
in
the
Via
dei
Banchi
,
near
St.
*NL*
Peter
's
.
In
Rome
,
as
everywhere
else
,
the
arrival
of
a
post-chaise
is
an
*NL*
event
.
Ten
young
descendants
of
Marius
and
the
Gracchi
,
barefooted
and
*NL*
out
at
elbows
,
with
one
hand
resting
on
the
hip
and
the
other
gracefully
*NL*
curved
above
the
head
,
stared
at
the
traveller
,
the
post-chaise
,
and
the
*NL*
horses
;
to
these
were
added
about
fifty
little
vagabonds
from
the
Papal
*NL*
States
,
who
earned
a
pittance
by
diving
into
the
Tiber
at
high
water
*NL*
from
the
bridge
of
St.
Angelo
.
Now
,
as
these
street
Arabs
of
Rome
,
*NL*
more
fortunate
than
those
of
Paris
,
understand
every
language
,
more
*NL*
especially
the
French
,
they
heard
the
traveller
order
an
apartment
,
a
*NL*
dinner
,
and
finally
inquire
the
way
to
the
house
of
Thomson
&
French
.
*NL*
The
result
was
that
when
the
new-comer
left
the
hotel
with
the
cicerone
,
*NL*
a
man
detached
himself
from
the
rest
of
the
idlers
,
and
without
having
*NL*
been
seen
by
the
traveller
,
and
appearing
to
excite
no
attention
from
*NL*
the
guide
,
followed
the
stranger
with
as
much
skill
as
a
Parisian
police
*NL*
agent
would
have
used
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Frenchman
had
been
so
impatient
to
reach
the
house
of
Thomson
&
*NL*
French
that
he
would
not
wait
for
the
horses
to
be
harnessed
,
but
left
*NL*
word
for
the
carriage
to
overtake
him
on
the
road
,
or
to
wait
for
him
*NL*
at
the
bankers
'
door
.
He
reached
it
before
the
carriage
arrived
.
The
*NL*
Frenchman
entered
,
leaving
in
the
anteroom
his
guide
,
who
immediately
*NL*
entered
into
conversation
with
two
or
three
of
the
industrious
idlers
*NL*
who
are
always
to
be
found
in
Rome
at
the
doors
of
banking-houses
,
*NL*
churches
,
museums
,
or
theatres
.
With
the
Frenchman
,
the
man
who
had
*NL*
followed
him
entered
too
;
the
Frenchman
knocked
at
the
inner
door
,
and
*NL*
entered
the
first
room
;
his
shadow
did
the
same
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Messrs.
Thomson
&
French
?
''
inquired
the
stranger
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
attendant
arose
at
a
sign
from
a
confidential
clerk
at
the
first
*NL*
desk
.
``
Whom
shall
I
announce
?
''
said
the
attendant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Baron
Danglars
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Follow
me
,
''
said
the
man
.
A
door
opened
,
through
which
the
attendant
*NL*
and
the
baron
disappeared
.
The
man
who
had
followed
Danglars
sat
down
on
*NL*
a
bench
.
The
clerk
continued
to
write
for
the
next
five
minutes
;
the
man
*NL*
preserved
profound
silence
,
and
remained
perfectly
motionless
.
Then
the
*NL*
pen
of
the
clerk
ceased
to
move
over
the
paper
;
he
raised
his
head
,
and
*NL*
appearing
to
be
perfectly
sure
of
privacy
,
--
``
Ah
,
ha
,
''
he
said
,
``
here
you
*NL*
are
,
Peppino
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
was
the
laconic
reply
.
``
You
have
found
out
that
there
is
*NL*
something
worth
having
about
this
large
gentleman
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
no
great
merit
due
to
me
,
for
we
were
informed
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
his
business
here
,
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pardieu
,
he
has
come
to
draw
,
but
I
do
n't
know
how
much
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
know
presently
,
my
friend
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
only
do
not
give
me
false
information
as
you
did
the
other
*NL*
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
?
--
of
whom
do
you
speak
?
Was
it
the
Englishman
who
*NL*
carried
off
3,000
crowns
from
here
the
other
day
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
he
really
had
3,000
crowns
,
and
we
found
them
.
I
mean
the
Russian
*NL*
prince
,
who
you
said
had
30,000
livres
,
and
we
only
found
22,000
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
have
searched
badly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Luigi
Vampa
himself
searched
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
?
But
you
must
let
me
make
my
observations
,
or
the
Frenchman
will
*NL*
transact
his
business
without
my
knowing
the
sum
.
''
Peppino
nodded
,
and
*NL*
taking
a
rosary
from
his
pocket
began
to
mutter
a
few
prayers
while
*NL*
the
clerk
disappeared
through
the
same
door
by
which
Danglars
and
the
*NL*
attendant
had
gone
out
.
At
the
expiration
of
ten
minutes
the
clerk
*NL*
returned
with
a
beaming
countenance
.
``
Well
?
''
asked
Peppino
of
his
*NL*
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Joy
,
joy
--
the
sum
is
large
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Five
or
six
millions
,
is
it
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
you
know
the
amount
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
receipt
of
the
Count
of
Monte
Cristo
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
how
came
you
to
be
so
well
acquainted
with
all
this
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
told
you
we
were
informed
beforehand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
why
do
you
apply
to
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
I
may
be
sure
I
have
the
right
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
is
indeed
he
.
Five
millions
--
a
pretty
sum
,
eh
,
Peppino
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hush
--
here
is
our
man
!
''
The
clerk
seized
his
pen
,
and
Peppino
his
*NL*
beads
;
one
was
writing
and
the
other
praying
when
the
door
opened
.
*NL*
Danglars
looked
radiant
with
joy
;
the
banker
accompanied
him
to
the
*NL*
door
.
Peppino
followed
Danglars
.
*NL*
*NL*
According
to
the
arrangements
,
the
carriage
was
waiting
at
the
door
.
The
*NL*
guide
held
the
door
open
.
Guides
are
useful
people
,
who
will
turn
their
*NL*
hands
to
anything
.
Danglars
leaped
into
the
carriage
like
a
young
man
of
*NL*
twenty
.
The
cicerone
reclosed
the
door
,
and
sprang
up
by
the
side
of
the
*NL*
coachman
.
Peppino
mounted
the
seat
behind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
your
excellency
visit
St.
Peter
's
?
''
asked
the
cicerone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
not
come
to
Rome
to
see
,
''
said
Danglars
aloud
;
then
he
added
*NL*
softly
,
with
an
avaricious
smile
,
``
I
came
to
touch
!
''
and
he
rapped
his
*NL*
pocket-book
,
in
which
he
had
just
placed
a
letter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
your
excellency
is
going
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
the
hotel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Casa
Pastrini
!
''
said
the
cicerone
to
the
coachman
,
and
the
carriage
*NL*
drove
rapidly
on
.
Ten
minutes
afterwards
the
baron
entered
his
*NL*
apartment
,
and
Peppino
stationed
himself
on
the
bench
outside
the
door
*NL*
of
the
hotel
,
after
having
whispered
something
in
the
ear
of
one
of
the
*NL*
descendants
of
Marius
and
the
Gracchi
whom
we
noticed
at
the
beginning
*NL*
of
the
chapter
,
who
immediately
ran
down
the
road
leading
to
the
Capitol
*NL*
at
his
fullest
speed
.
Danglars
was
tired
and
sleepy
;
he
therefore
went
*NL*
to
bed
,
placing
his
pocketbook
under
his
pillow
.
Peppino
had
a
little
*NL*
spare
time
,
so
he
had
a
game
of
mora
with
the
facchini
,
lost
three
*NL*
crowns
,
and
then
to
console
himself
drank
a
bottle
of
Orvieto
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
morning
Danglars
awoke
late
,
though
he
went
to
bed
so
early
;
he
*NL*
had
not
slept
well
for
five
or
six
nights
,
even
if
he
had
slept
at
all
.
*NL*
He
breakfasted
heartily
,
and
caring
little
,
as
he
said
,
for
the
beauties
*NL*
of
the
Eternal
City
,
ordered
post-horses
at
noon
.
But
Danglars
had
not
*NL*
reckoned
upon
the
formalities
of
the
police
and
the
idleness
of
the
*NL*
posting-master
.
The
horses
only
arrived
at
two
o'clock
,
and
the
cicerone
*NL*
did
not
bring
the
passport
till
three
.
All
these
preparations
had
*NL*
collected
a
number
of
idlers
round
the
door
of
Signor
Pastrini
's
;
the
*NL*
descendants
of
Marius
and
the
Gracchi
were
also
not
wanting
.
The
baron
*NL*
walked
triumphantly
through
the
crowd
,
who
for
the
sake
of
gain
styled
*NL*
him
``
your
excellency
.
''
As
Danglars
had
hitherto
contented
himself
*NL*
with
being
called
a
baron
,
he
felt
rather
flattered
at
the
title
of
*NL*
excellency
,
and
distributed
a
dozen
silver
coins
among
the
beggars
,
who
*NL*
were
ready
,
for
twelve
more
,
to
call
him
``
your
highness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Which
road
?
''
asked
the
postilion
in
Italian
.
``
The
Ancona
road
,
''
replied
*NL*
the
baron
.
Signor
Pastrini
interpreted
the
question
and
answer
,
and
the
*NL*
horses
galloped
off
.
Danglars
intended
travelling
to
Venice
,
where
he
*NL*
would
receive
one
part
of
his
fortune
,
and
then
proceeding
to
Vienna
,
*NL*
where
he
would
find
the
rest
,
he
meant
to
take
up
his
residence
in
the
*NL*
latter
town
,
which
he
had
been
told
was
a
city
of
pleasure
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
scarcely
advanced
three
leagues
out
of
Rome
when
daylight
began
*NL*
to
disappear
.
Danglars
had
not
intended
starting
so
late
,
or
he
would
*NL*
have
remained
;
he
put
his
head
out
and
asked
the
postilion
how
long
*NL*
it
would
be
before
they
reached
the
next
town
.
``
Non
capisco
''
-LRB-
do
not
*NL*
understand
-RRB-
,
was
the
reply
.
Danglars
bent
his
head
,
which
he
meant
to
*NL*
imply
,
``
Very
well
.
''
The
carriage
again
moved
on
.
``
I
will
stop
at
the
*NL*
first
posting-house
,
''
said
Danglars
to
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
still
felt
the
same
self-satisfaction
which
he
had
experienced
the
*NL*
previous
evening
,
and
which
had
procured
him
so
good
a
night
's
rest
.
He
*NL*
was
luxuriously
stretched
in
a
good
English
calash
,
with
double
springs
;
*NL*
he
was
drawn
by
four
good
horses
,
at
full
gallop
;
he
knew
the
relay
*NL*
to
be
at
a
distance
of
seven
leagues
.
What
subject
of
meditation
could
*NL*
present
itself
to
the
banker
,
so
fortunately
become
bankrupt
?
*NL*
*NL*
Danglars
thought
for
ten
minutes
about
his
wife
in
Paris
;
another
ten
*NL*
minutes
about
his
daughter
travelling
with
Mademoiselle
d'Armilly
;
*NL*
the
same
period
was
given
to
his
creditors
,
and
the
manner
in
which
*NL*
he
intended
spending
their
money
;
and
then
,
having
no
subject
left
for
*NL*
contemplation
,
he
shut
his
eyes
,
and
fell
asleep
.
Now
and
then
a
jolt
*NL*
more
violent
than
the
rest
caused
him
to
open
his
eyes
;
then
he
felt
*NL*
that
he
was
still
being
carried
with
great
rapidity
over
the
same
*NL*
country
,
thickly
strewn
with
broken
aqueducts
,
which
looked
like
granite
*NL*
giants
petrified
while
running
a
race
.
But
the
night
was
cold
,
dull
,
and
*NL*
rainy
,
and
it
was
much
more
pleasant
for
a
traveller
to
remain
in
the
*NL*
warm
carriage
than
to
put
his
head
out
of
the
window
to
make
inquiries
*NL*
of
a
postilion
whose
only
answer
was
``
Non
capisco
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Danglars
therefore
continued
to
sleep
,
saying
to
himself
that
he
would
*NL*
be
sure
to
awake
at
the
posting-house
.
The
carriage
stopped
.
Danglars
*NL*
fancied
that
they
had
reached
the
long-desired
point
;
he
opened
his
eyes
*NL*
and
looked
through
the
window
,
expecting
to
find
himself
in
the
midst
*NL*
of
some
town
,
or
at
least
village
;
but
he
saw
nothing
except
what
*NL*
seemed
like
a
ruin
,
where
three
or
four
men
went
and
came
like
shadows
.
*NL*
Danglars
waited
a
moment
,
expecting
the
postilion
to
come
and
demand
*NL*
payment
with
the
termination
of
his
stage
.
He
intended
taking
advantage
*NL*
of
the
opportunity
to
make
fresh
inquiries
of
the
new
conductor
;
but
the
*NL*
horses
were
unharnessed
,
and
others
put
in
their
places
,
without
any
*NL*
one
claiming
money
from
the
traveller
.
Danglars
,
astonished
,
opened
the
*NL*
door
;
but
a
strong
hand
pushed
him
back
,
and
the
carriage
rolled
on
.
The
*NL*
baron
was
completely
roused
.
``
Eh
?
''
he
said
to
the
postilion
,
``
eh
,
mio
*NL*
caro
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
another
little
piece
of
Italian
the
baron
had
learned
from
*NL*
hearing
his
daughter
sing
Italian
duets
with
Cavalcanti
.
But
mio
caro
*NL*
did
not
reply
.
Danglars
then
opened
the
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
my
friend
,
''
he
said
,
thrusting
his
hand
through
the
opening
,
*NL*
``
where
are
we
going
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dentro
la
testa
!
''
answered
a
solemn
and
imperious
voice
,
accompanied
by
*NL*
a
menacing
gesture
.
Danglars
thought
dentro
la
testa
meant
,
``
Put
in
your
*NL*
head
!
''
He
was
making
rapid
progress
in
Italian
.
He
obeyed
,
not
without
*NL*
some
uneasiness
,
which
,
momentarily
increasing
,
caused
his
mind
,
instead
*NL*
of
being
as
unoccupied
as
it
was
when
he
began
his
journey
,
to
fill
with
*NL*
ideas
which
were
very
likely
to
keep
a
traveller
awake
,
more
especially
*NL*
one
in
such
a
situation
as
Danglars
.
His
eyes
acquired
that
quality
*NL*
which
in
the
first
moment
of
strong
emotion
enables
them
to
see
*NL*
distinctly
,
and
which
afterwards
fails
from
being
too
much
taxed
.
Before
*NL*
we
are
alarmed
,
we
see
correctly
;
when
we
are
alarmed
,
we
see
double
;
*NL*
and
when
we
have
been
alarmed
,
we
see
nothing
but
trouble
.
Danglars
*NL*
observed
a
man
in
a
cloak
galloping
at
the
right
hand
of
the
carriage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Some
gendarme
!
''
he
exclaimed
.
``
Can
I
have
been
intercepted
by
French
*NL*
telegrams
to
the
pontifical
authorities
?
''
He
resolved
to
end
his
*NL*
anxiety
.
``
Where
are
you
taking
me
?
''
he
asked
.
``
Dentro
la
testa
,
''
replied
*NL*
the
same
voice
,
with
the
same
menacing
accent
.
*NL*
*NL*
Danglars
turned
to
the
left
;
another
man
on
horseback
was
galloping
*NL*
on
that
side
.
``
Decidedly
,
''
said
Danglars
,
with
the
perspiration
on
his
*NL*
forehead
,
``
I
must
be
under
arrest
.
''
And
he
threw
himself
back
in
the
*NL*
calash
,
not
this
time
to
sleep
,
but
to
think
.
Directly
afterwards
the
*NL*
moon
rose
.
He
then
saw
the
great
aqueducts
,
those
stone
phantoms
which
*NL*
he
had
before
remarked
,
only
then
they
were
on
the
right
hand
,
now
they
*NL*
were
on
the
left
.
He
understood
that
they
had
described
a
circle
,
and
*NL*
were
bringing
him
back
to
Rome
.
``
Oh
,
unfortunate
!
''
he
cried
,
``
they
*NL*
must
have
obtained
my
arrest
.
''
The
carriage
continued
to
roll
on
with
*NL*
frightful
speed
.
An
hour
of
terror
elapsed
,
for
every
spot
they
passed
*NL*
showed
that
they
were
on
the
road
back
.
At
length
he
saw
a
dark
mass
,
*NL*
against
which
it
seemed
as
if
the
carriage
was
about
to
dash
;
but
the
*NL*
vehicle
turned
to
one
side
,
leaving
the
barrier
behind
and
Danglars
saw
*NL*
that
it
was
one
of
the
ramparts
encircling
Rome
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mon
dieu
!
''
cried
Danglars
,
``
we
are
not
returning
to
Rome
;
then
it
*NL*
is
not
justice
which
is
pursuing
me
!
Gracious
heavens
;
another
idea
*NL*
presents
itself
--
what
if
they
should
be
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
His
hair
stood
on
end
.
He
remembered
those
interesting
stories
,
so
*NL*
little
believed
in
Paris
,
respecting
Roman
bandits
;
he
remembered
the
*NL*
adventures
that
Albert
de
Morcerf
had
related
when
it
was
intended
that
*NL*
he
should
marry
Mademoiselle
Eugenie
.
``
They
are
robbers
,
perhaps
,
''
he
*NL*
muttered
.
Just
then
the
carriage
rolled
on
something
harder
than
gravel
*NL*
road
.
Danglars
hazarded
a
look
on
both
sides
of
the
road
,
and
perceived
*NL*
monuments
of
a
singular
form
,
and
his
mind
now
recalled
all
the
details
*NL*
Morcerf
had
related
,
and
comparing
them
with
his
own
situation
,
he
*NL*
felt
sure
that
he
must
be
on
the
Appian
Way
.
On
the
left
,
in
a
sort
of
*NL*
valley
,
he
perceived
a
circular
excavation
.
It
was
Caracalla
's
circus
.
*NL*
On
a
word
from
the
man
who
rode
at
the
side
of
the
carriage
,
it
stopped
.
*NL*
At
the
same
time
the
door
was
opened
.
``
Scendi
!
''
exclaimed
a
commanding
*NL*
voice
.
Danglars
instantly
descended
;
although
he
did
not
yet
speak
*NL*
Italian
,
he
understood
it
very
well
.
More
dead
than
alive
,
he
looked
*NL*
around
him
.
Four
men
surrounded
him
,
besides
the
postilion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Di
qua
,
''
said
one
of
the
men
,
descending
a
little
path
leading
out
of
*NL*
the
Appian
Way
.
Danglars
followed
his
guide
without
opposition
,
and
*NL*
had
no
occasion
to
turn
around
to
see
whether
the
three
others
were
*NL*
following
him
.
Still
it
appeared
as
though
they
were
stationed
at
equal
*NL*
distances
from
one
another
,
like
sentinels
.
After
walking
for
about
ten
*NL*
minutes
,
during
which
Danglars
did
not
exchange
a
single
word
with
his
*NL*
guide
,
he
found
himself
between
a
hillock
and
a
clump
of
high
weeds
;
*NL*
three
men
,
standing
silent
,
formed
a
triangle
,
of
which
he
was
the
*NL*
centre
.
He
wished
to
speak
,
but
his
tongue
refused
to
move
.
``
Avanti
!
''
*NL*
said
the
same
sharp
and
imperative
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
time
Danglars
had
double
reason
to
understand
,
for
if
the
word
*NL*
and
gesture
had
not
explained
the
speaker
's
meaning
,
it
was
clearly
*NL*
expressed
by
the
man
walking
behind
him
,
who
pushed
him
so
rudely
that
*NL*
he
struck
against
the
guide
.
This
guide
was
our
friend
Peppino
,
who
*NL*
dashed
into
the
thicket
of
high
weeds
,
through
a
path
which
none
but
*NL*
lizards
or
polecats
could
have
imagined
to
be
an
open
road
.
Peppino
*NL*
stopped
before
a
pit
overhung
by
thick
hedges
;
the
pit
,
half
open
,
*NL*
afforded
a
passage
to
the
young
man
,
who
disappeared
like
the
evil
*NL*
spirits
in
the
fairy
tales
.
The
voice
and
gesture
of
the
man
who
*NL*
followed
Danglars
ordered
him
to
do
the
same
.
There
was
no
longer
*NL*
any
doubt
,
the
bankrupt
was
in
the
hands
of
Roman
banditti
.
Danglars
*NL*
acquitted
himself
like
a
man
placed
between
two
dangerous
positions
,
*NL*
and
who
is
rendered
brave
by
fear
.
Notwithstanding
his
large
stomach
,
*NL*
certainly
not
intended
to
penetrate
the
fissures
of
the
Campagna
,
he
*NL*
slid
down
like
Peppino
,
and
closing
his
eyes
fell
upon
his
feet
.
As
he
*NL*
touched
the
ground
,
he
opened
his
eyes
.
The
path
was
wide
,
but
dark
.
*NL*
Peppino
,
who
cared
little
for
being
recognized
now
that
he
was
in
his
*NL*
own
territories
,
struck
a
light
and
lit
a
torch
.
Two
other
men
descended
*NL*
after
Danglars
forming
the
rearguard
,
and
pushing
Danglars
whenever
he
*NL*
happened
to
stop
,
they
came
by
a
gentle
declivity
to
the
intersection
of
*NL*
two
corridors
.
The
walls
were
hollowed
out
in
sepulchres
,
one
above
the
*NL*
other
,
and
which
seemed
in
contrast
with
the
white
stones
to
open
their
*NL*
large
dark
eyes
,
like
those
which
we
see
on
the
faces
of
the
dead
.
A
*NL*
sentinel
struck
the
rings
of
his
carbine
against
his
left
hand
.
``
Who
*NL*
comes
there
?
''
he
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
friend
,
a
friend
!
''
said
Peppino
;
``
but
where
is
the
captain
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
''
said
the
sentinel
,
pointing
over
his
shoulder
to
a
spacious
*NL*
crypt
,
hollowed
out
of
the
rock
,
the
lights
from
which
shone
into
the
*NL*
passage
through
the
large
arched
openings
.
``
Fine
spoil
,
captain
,
fine
*NL*
spoil
!
''
said
Peppino
in
Italian
,
and
taking
Danglars
by
the
collar
of
*NL*
his
coat
he
dragged
him
to
an
opening
resembling
a
door
,
through
which
*NL*
they
entered
the
apartment
which
the
captain
appeared
to
have
made
his
*NL*
dwelling-place
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
this
the
man
?
''
asked
the
captain
,
who
was
attentively
reading
*NL*
Plutarch
's
``
Life
of
Alexander
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Himself
,
captain
--
himself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
show
him
to
me
.
''
At
this
rather
impertinent
order
,
Peppino
*NL*
raised
his
torch
to
the
face
of
Danglars
,
who
hastily
withdrew
that
he
*NL*
might
not
have
his
eyelashes
burnt
.
His
agitated
features
presented
*NL*
the
appearance
of
pale
and
hideous
terror
.
``
The
man
is
tired
,
''
said
the
*NL*
captain
,
``
conduct
him
to
his
bed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
murmured
Danglars
,
``
that
bed
is
probably
one
of
the
coffins
*NL*
hollowed
in
the
wall
,
and
the
sleep
I
shall
enjoy
will
be
death
from
one
*NL*
of
the
poniards
I
see
glistening
in
the
darkness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
From
their
beds
of
dried
leaves
or
wolf-skins
at
the
back
of
the
chamber
*NL*
now
arose
the
companions
of
the
man
who
had
been
found
by
Albert
de
*NL*
Morcerf
reading
``
Caesar
's
Commentaries
,
''
and
by
Danglars
studying
the
*NL*
``
Life
of
Alexander
.
''
The
banker
uttered
a
groan
and
followed
his
guide
;
*NL*
he
neither
supplicated
nor
exclaimed
.
He
no
longer
possessed
strength
,
*NL*
will
,
power
,
or
feeling
;
he
followed
where
they
led
him
.
At
length
he
*NL*
found
himself
at
the
foot
of
a
staircase
,
and
he
mechanically
lifted
*NL*
his
foot
five
or
six
times
.
Then
a
low
door
was
opened
before
him
,
and
*NL*
bending
his
head
to
avoid
striking
his
forehead
he
entered
a
small
room
*NL*
cut
out
of
the
rock
.
The
cell
was
clean
,
though
empty
,
and
dry
,
though
*NL*
situated
at
an
immeasurable
distance
under
the
earth
.
A
bed
of
dried
*NL*
grass
covered
with
goat-skins
was
placed
in
one
corner
.
Danglars
*NL*
brightened
up
on
beholding
it
,
fancying
that
it
gave
some
promise
of
*NL*
safety
.
``
Oh
,
God
be
praised
,
''
he
said
;
``
it
is
a
real
bed
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ecco
!
''
said
the
guide
,
and
pushing
Danglars
into
the
cell
,
he
closed
*NL*
the
door
upon
him
.
A
bolt
grated
and
Danglars
was
a
prisoner
.
If
there
*NL*
had
been
no
bolt
,
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
him
to
pass
through
*NL*
the
midst
of
the
garrison
who
held
the
catacombs
of
St.
Sebastian
,
*NL*
encamped
round
a
master
whom
our
readers
must
have
recognized
as
the
*NL*
famous
Luigi
Vampa
.
Danglars
,
too
,
had
recognized
the
bandit
,
whose
*NL*
existence
he
would
not
believe
when
Albert
de
Morcerf
mentioned
him
in
*NL*
Paris
;
and
not
only
did
he
recognize
him
,
but
the
cell
in
which
Albert
*NL*
had
been
confined
,
and
which
was
probably
kept
for
the
accommodation
*NL*
of
strangers
.
These
recollections
were
dwelt
upon
with
some
pleasure
*NL*
by
Danglars
,
and
restored
him
to
some
degree
of
tranquillity
.
Since
the
*NL*
bandits
had
not
despatched
him
at
once
,
he
felt
that
they
would
not
kill
*NL*
him
at
all
.
They
had
arrested
him
for
the
purpose
of
robbery
,
and
as
he
*NL*
had
only
a
few
louis
about
him
,
he
doubted
not
he
would
be
ransomed
.
*NL*
He
remembered
that
Morcerf
had
been
taxed
at
4,000
crowns
,
and
as
he
*NL*
considered
himself
of
much
greater
importance
than
Morcerf
he
fixed
*NL*
his
own
price
at
8,000
crowns
.
Eight
thousand
crowns
amounted
to
48,000
*NL*
livres
;
he
would
then
have
about
5,050,000
francs
left
.
With
this
sum
he
*NL*
could
manage
to
keep
out
of
difficulties
.
Therefore
,
tolerably
secure
in
*NL*
being
able
to
extricate
himself
from
his
position
,
provided
he
were
not
*NL*
rated
at
the
unreasonable
sum
of
5,050,000
francs
,
he
stretched
himself
*NL*
on
his
bed
,
and
after
turning
over
two
or
three
times
,
fell
asleep
with
*NL*
the
tranquillity
of
the
hero
whose
life
Luigi
Vampa
was
studying
.

*NL*
*NL*
We
awake
from
every
sleep
except
the
one
dreaded
by
Danglars
.
He
awoke
.
*NL*
To
a
Parisian
accustomed
to
silken
curtains
,
walls
hung
with
velvet
*NL*
drapery
,
and
the
soft
perfume
of
burning
wood
,
the
white
smoke
of
which
*NL*
diffuses
itself
in
graceful
curves
around
the
room
,
the
appearance
of
*NL*
the
whitewashed
cell
which
greeted
his
eyes
on
awakening
seemed
like
*NL*
the
continuation
of
some
disagreeable
dream
.
But
in
such
a
situation
*NL*
a
single
moment
suffices
to
change
the
strongest
doubt
into
certainty
.
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
''
he
murmured
,
``
I
am
in
the
hands
of
the
brigands
of
whom
*NL*
Albert
de
Morcerf
spoke
.
''
His
first
idea
was
to
breathe
,
that
he
might
*NL*
know
whether
he
was
wounded
.
He
borrowed
this
from
``
Don
Quixote
,
''
the
*NL*
only
book
he
had
ever
read
,
but
which
he
still
slightly
remembered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
he
cried
,
``
they
have
not
wounded
,
but
perhaps
they
have
robbed
*NL*
me
!
''
and
he
thrust
his
hands
into
his
pockets
.
They
were
untouched
;
the
*NL*
hundred
louis
he
had
reserved
for
his
journey
from
Rome
to
Venice
were
*NL*
in
his
trousers
pocket
,
and
in
that
of
his
great-coat
he
found
the
*NL*
little
note-case
containing
his
letter
of
credit
for
5,050,000
francs
.
*NL*
``
Singular
bandits
!
''
he
exclaimed
;
``
they
have
left
me
my
purse
and
*NL*
pocket-book
.
As
I
was
saying
last
night
,
they
intend
me
to
be
ransomed
.
*NL*
Hallo

is

*NL*
one
of
Breguet
's
repeaters
,
which
he
had
carefully
wound
up
on
the
*NL*
previous
night
,
struck
half
past
five
.
Without
this
,
Danglars
would
have
*NL*
been
quite
ignorant
of
the
time
,
for
daylight
did
not
reach
his
cell
.
*NL*
Should
he
demand
an
explanation
from
the
bandits
,
or
should
he
wait
*NL*
patiently
for
them
to
propose
it
?
The
last
alternative
seemed
the
most
*NL*
prudent
,
so
he
waited
until
twelve
o'clock
.
During
all
this
time
a
*NL*
sentinel
,
who
had
been
relieved
at
eight
o'clock
,
had
been
watching
his
*NL*
door
.
Danglars
suddenly
felt
a
strong
inclination
to
see
the
person
who
*NL*
kept
watch
over
him
.
He
had
noticed
that
a
few
rays
,
not
of
daylight
,
*NL*
but
from
a
lamp
,
penetrated
through
the
ill-joined
planks
of
the
door
;
*NL*
he
approached
just
as
the
brigand
was
refreshing
himself
with
a
mouthful
*NL*
of
brandy
,
which
,
owing
to
the
leathern
bottle
containing
it
,
sent
*NL*
forth
an
odor
which
was
extremely
unpleasant
to
Danglars
.
``
Faugh
!
''
he
*NL*
exclaimed
,
retreating
to
the
farther
corner
of
his
cell
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
twelve
this
man
was
replaced
by
another
functionary
,
and
Danglars
,
*NL*
wishing
to
catch
sight
of
his
new
guardian
,
approached
the
door
again
.
*NL*
He
was
an
athletic
,
gigantic
bandit
,
with
large
eyes
,
thick
lips
,
and
*NL*
a
flat
nose
;
his
red
hair
fell
in
dishevelled
masses
like
snakes
around
*NL*
his
shoulders
.
``
Ah
,
ha
,
''
cried
Danglars
,
``
this
fellow
is
more
like
an
*NL*
ogre
than
anything
else
;
however
,
I
am
rather
too
old
and
tough
to
be
*NL*
very
good
eating
!
''
We
see
that
Danglars
was
collected
enough
to
jest
;
at
*NL*
the
same
time
,
as
though
to
disprove
the
ogreish
propensities
,
the
man
*NL*
took
some
black
bread
,
cheese
,
and
onions
from
his
wallet
,
which
he
*NL*
began
devouring
voraciously
.
``
May
I
be
hanged
,
''
said
Danglars
,
glancing
*NL*
at
the
bandit
's
dinner
through
the
crevices
of
the
door
,
--
``
may
I
be
*NL*
hanged
if
I
can
understand
how
people
can
eat
such
filth
!
''
and
he
*NL*
withdrew
to
seat
himself
upon
his
goat-skin
,
which
reminded
him
of
the
*NL*
smell
of
the
brandy
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
mysteries
of
nature
are
incomprehensible
,
and
there
are
certain
*NL*
invitations
contained
in
even
the
coarsest
food
which
appeal
very
*NL*
irresistibly
to
a
fasting
stomach
.
Danglars
felt
his
own
not
to
be
very
*NL*
well
supplied
just
then
,
and
gradually
the
man
appeared
less
ugly
,
the
*NL*
bread
less
black
,
and
the
cheese
more
fresh
,
while
those
dreadful
vulgar
*NL*
onions
recalled
to
his
mind
certain
sauces
and
side-dishes
,
which
his
*NL*
cook
prepared
in
a
very
superior
manner
whenever
he
said
,
``
Monsieur
*NL*
Deniseau
,
let
me
have
a
nice
little
fricassee
to-day
.
''
He
got
up
and
*NL*
knocked
on
the
door
;
the
bandit
raised
his
head
.
Danglars
knew
that
*NL*
he
was
heard
,
so
he
redoubled
his
blows
.
``
Che
cosa
?
''
asked
the
bandit
.
*NL*
``
Come
,
come
,
''
said
Danglars
,
tapping
his
fingers
against
the
door
,
``
I
*NL*
think
it
is
quite
time
to
think
of
giving
me
something
to
eat
!
''
But
*NL*
whether
he
did
not
understand
him
,
or
whether
he
had
received
no
orders
*NL*
respecting
the
nourishment
of
Danglars
,
the
giant
,
without
answering
,
*NL*
went
on
with
his
dinner
.
Danglars
'
feelings
were
hurt
,
and
not
wishing
*NL*
to
put
himself
under
obligations
to
the
brute
,
the
banker
threw
himself
*NL*
down
again
on
his
goat-skin
and
did
not
breathe
another
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
Four
hours
passed
by
and
the
giant
was
replaced
by
another
bandit
.
*NL*
Danglars
,
who
really
began
to
experience
sundry
gnawings
at
the
stomach
,
*NL*
arose
softly
,
again
applied
his
eye
to
the
crack
of
the
door
,
and
*NL*
recognized
the
intelligent
countenance
of
his
guide
.
It
was
,
indeed
,
*NL*
Peppino
who
was
preparing
to
mount
guard
as
comfortably
as
possible
by
*NL*
seating
himself
opposite
to
the
door
,
and
placing
between
his
legs
an
*NL*
earthen
pan
,
containing
chick-pease
stewed
with
bacon
.
Near
the
pan
he
*NL*
also
placed
a
pretty
little
basket
of
Villetri
grapes
and
a
flask
*NL*
of
Orvieto
.
Peppino
was
decidedly
an
epicure
.
Danglars
watched
these
*NL*
preparations
and
his
mouth
watered
.
``
Come
,
''
he
said
to
himself
,
``
let
me
*NL*
try
if
he
will
be
more
tractable
than
the
other
;
''
and
he
tapped
gently
*NL*
at
the
door
.
``
On
y
va
,
''
-LRB-
coming
-RRB-
exclaimed
Peppino
,
who
from
frequenting
*NL*
the
house
of
Signor
Pastrini
understood
French
perfectly
in
all
its
*NL*
idioms
.
*NL*
*NL*
Danglars
immediately
recognized
him
as
the
man
who
had
called
out
in
*NL*
such
a
furious
manner
,
``
Put
in
your
head
!
''
But
this
was
not
the
time
for
*NL*
recrimination
,
so
he
assumed
his
most
agreeable
manner
and
said
with
a
*NL*
gracious
smile
,
--
``
Excuse
me
,
sir
,
but
are
they
not
going
to
give
me
any
*NL*
dinner
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
your
excellency
happen
to
be
hungry
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Happen
to
be
hungry
,
--
that
's
pretty
good
,
when
I
have
n't
eaten
for
*NL*
twenty-four
hours
!
''
muttered
Danglars
.
Then
he
added
aloud
,
``
Yes
,
sir
,
I
*NL*
am
hungry
--
very
hungry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
would
your
excellency
like
?
''
and
Peppino
placed
his
pan
on
the
*NL*
ground
,
so
that
the
steam
rose
directly
under
the
nostrils
of
Danglars
.
*NL*
``
Give
your
orders
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
kitchens
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Kitchens
?
--
of
course
--
complete
ones
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
cooks
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excellent
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
a
fowl
,
fish
,
game
,
--
it
signifies
little
,
so
that
I
eat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
your
excellency
pleases
.
You
mentioned
a
fowl
,
I
think
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
a
fowl
.
''
Peppino
,
turning
around
,
shouted
,
``
A
fowl
for
his
*NL*
excellency
!
''
His
voice
yet
echoed
in
the
archway
when
a
handsome
,
*NL*
graceful
,
and
half-naked
young
man
appeared
,
bearing
a
fowl
in
a
silver
*NL*
dish
on
his
head
,
without
the
assistance
of
his
hands
.
``
I
could
almost
*NL*
believe
myself
at
the
Cafe
de
Paris
,
''
murmured
Danglars
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
,
your
excellency
,
''
said
Peppino
,
taking
the
fowl
from
the
young
*NL*
bandit
and
placing
it
on
the
worm-eaten
table
,
which
with
the
stool
*NL*
and
the
goat-skin
bed
formed
the
entire
furniture
of
the
cell
.
Danglars
*NL*
asked
for
a
knife
and
fork
.
``
Here
,
excellency
,
''
said
Peppino
,
offering
*NL*
him
a
little
blunt
knife
and
a
boxwood
fork
.
Danglars
took
the
knife
in
*NL*
one
hand
and
the
fork
in
the
other
,
and
was
about
to
cut
up
the
fowl
.
*NL*
``
Pardon
me
,
excellency
,
''
said
Peppino
,
placing
his
hand
on
the
banker
's
*NL*
shoulder
;
``
people
pay
here
before
they
eat
.
They
might
not
be
satisfied
,
*NL*
and
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
ha
,
''
thought
Danglars
,
``
this
is
not
so
much
like
Paris
,
except
that
*NL*
I
shall
probably
be
skinned
!
Never
mind
,
I
'll
fix
that
all
right
.
I
have
*NL*
always
heard
how
cheap
poultry
is
in
Italy
;
I
should
think
a
fowl
is
*NL*
worth
about
twelve
sous
at
Rome
.
--
There
,
''
he
said
,
throwing
a
louis
*NL*
down
.
Peppino
picked
up
the
louis
,
and
Danglars
again
prepared
to
carve
*NL*
the
fowl
.
``
Stay
a
moment
,
your
excellency
,
''
said
Peppino
,
rising
;
``
you
*NL*
still
owe
me
something
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
said
they
would
skin
me
,
''
thought
Danglars
;
but
resolving
to
resist
*NL*
the
extortion
,
he
said
,
``
Come
,
how
much
do
I
owe
you
for
this
fowl
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
excellency
has
given
me
a
louis
on
account
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
louis
on
account
for
a
fowl
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
;
and
your
excellency
now
owes
me
4,999
louis
.
''
Danglars
*NL*
opened
his
enormous
eyes
on
hearing
this
gigantic
joke
.
``
Come
,
come
,
*NL*
this
is
very
droll
--
very
amusing
--
I
allow
;
but
,
as
I
am
very
hungry
,
*NL*
pray
allow
me
to
eat
.
Stay
,
here
is
another
louis
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
that
will
make
only
4,998
louis
more
,
''
said
Peppino
with
the
same
*NL*
indifference
.
``
I
shall
get
them
all
in
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
as
for
that
,
''
said
Danglars
,
angry
at
this
prolongation
of
the
*NL*
jest
,
--
``
as
for
that
you
wo
n't
get
them
at
all
.
Go
to
the
devil
!
You
do
*NL*
not
know
with
whom
you
have
to
deal
!
''
Peppino
made
a
sign
,
and
the
youth
*NL*
hastily
removed
the
fowl
.
Danglars
threw
himself
upon
his
goat-skin
,
*NL*
and
Peppino
,
reclosing
the
door
,
again
began
eating
his
pease
and
bacon
.
*NL*
Though
Danglars
could
not
see
Peppino
,
the
noise
of
his
teeth
allowed
*NL*
no
doubt
as
to
his
occupation
.
He
was
certainly
eating
,
and
noisily
too
,
*NL*
like
an
ill-bred
man
.
``
Brute
!
''
said
Danglars
.
Peppino
pretended
not
to
*NL*
hear
him
,
and
without
even
turning
his
head
continued
to
eat
slowly
.
*NL*
Danglars
'
stomach
felt
so
empty
,
that
it
seemed
as
if
it
would
be
*NL*
impossible
ever
to
fill
it
again
;
still
he
had
patience
for
another
*NL*
half-hour
,
which
appeared
to
him
like
a
century
.
He
again
arose
and
went
*NL*
to
the
door
.
``
Come
,
sir
,
do
not
keep
me
starving
here
any
longer
,
but
*NL*
tell
me
what
they
want

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
your
excellency
,
it
is
you
who
should
tell
us
what
you
want

Give
*NL*
your
orders
,
and
we
will
execute
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
open
the
door
directly
.
''
Peppino
obeyed
.
``
Now
look
here
,
I
want
*NL*
something
to
eat
!
To
eat

do
you
hear

*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
hungry

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
would
your
excellency
like
to
eat

*NL*
*NL*
``
A
piece
of
dry
bread

beyond

accursed
place

*NL*
*NL*
``
Bread

Very
well

Hallo

there

some
bread
!
''
he
called
.
The
youth
*NL*
brought
a
small
loaf
.
``
How
much
?
''
asked
Danglars
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Four
thousand
nine
hundred
and
ninety-eight
louis

said
Peppino
;
``
You
*NL*

paid
two
louis
in

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
One
hundred

*NL*
*NL*
``
One

thousand
francs

repeated
Peppino
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
only
asked
100,000
francs
for

*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have

*NL*
*NL*
``
What

still
keeping
up
this
silly
jest

My

is
perfectly

You
had
better
tell

at

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what

said
Danglars

enraged

100,000

*NL*
*NL*

apiece

half
a

''
*NL*
*NL*
Danglars
shuddered
.
The
bandage
fell
from
his
eyes
,
and
he
understood
*NL*
the
joke
,
which
he
did
not
think
quite
so
stupid
as
he
had
done
just
*NL*
before
.
``
Come

he
said
,
``
if
I
pay
you
the
100,000

will
you
be

satisfied

eat
at
my

*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly

said
Peppino
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
how
can
I
pay

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

nothing

open

Thomson

*NL*
French

give
me
a
draft
for
4,998
louis
on
these
*NL*
gentlemen
,
and
our
banker
shall
take
it

''
Danglars
thought
it
as
well
*NL*
to
comply
with
a
good
grace
,
so
he
took
the
pen
,
ink
,
and
paper
Peppino
*NL*
offered
him
,
wrote
the
draft
,
and
signed
it

``

he
said
,
``
here

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
here
is
your
fowl

''
Danglars
sighed
while
he
carved
the
fowl
;
*NL*
it
appeared
very
thin
for
the
price
it
had
cost
.
As
for
Peppino
,
he
*NL*
examined
the
paper
attentively
,
put
it
into
his
pocket
,
and
continued
*NL*
eating
his
pease

The
Pardon

The
next
day
Danglars
was
again
hungry
;
certainly
the
air
of
that
*NL*
dungeon
was
very
provocative
of
appetite
.
The
prisoner
expected
that
*NL*
he
would
be
at
no
expense
that
day
,
for
like
an
economical
man
he
had
*NL*
concealed
half
of
his
fowl
and
a
piece
of
the
bread
in
the
corner
of
his
*NL*
cell
.
But
he
had
no
sooner
eaten
than
he
felt
thirsty
;
he
had
forgotten
*NL*
that
.
He
struggled
against
his
thirst
till
his
tongue
clave
to
the
*NL*
roof
of
his
mouth
;
then
,
no
longer
able
to
resist
,
he
called
out
.
The
*NL*
sentinel
opened
the
door
;
it
was
a
new
face
.
He
thought
it
would
be
*NL*
better
to
transact
business
with
his
old
acquaintance
,
so
he
sent
for
*NL*
Peppino
.
``
Here
I
am
,
your
excellency
,
''
said
Peppino
,
with
an
eagerness
*NL*
which
Danglars
thought
favorable
to
him
.
``
What
do
you
want
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Something
to
drink
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
excellency
knows
that
wine
is
beyond
all
price
near
Rome
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
give
me
water
,
''
cried
Danglars
,
endeavoring
to
parry
the
blow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
water
is
even
more
scarce
than
wine
,
your
excellency
,
--
there
has
*NL*
been
such
a
drought
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
''
thought
Danglars
,
``
it
is
the
same
old
story
.
''
And
while
he
*NL*
smiled
as
he
attempted
to
regard
the
affair
as
a
joke
,
he
felt
his
*NL*
temples
get
moist
with
perspiration
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
my
friend
,
''
said
Danglars
,
seeing
that
he
made
no
impression
on
*NL*
Peppino
,
``
you
will
not
refuse
me
a
glass
of
wine
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
already
told
you
that
we
do
not
sell
at
retail
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
let
me
have
a
bottle
of
the
least
expensive
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
all
the
same
price
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
is
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Twenty-five
thousand
francs
a
bottle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
,
''
cried
Danglars
,
in
a
tone
whose
bitterness
Harpagon
-LSB-
*
-RSB-
alone
*NL*
has
been
capable
of
revealing
--
``
tell
me
that
you
wish
to
despoil
me
of
*NL*
all
;
it
will
be
sooner
over
than
devouring

piecemeal

``

And
the

moment
Luigi

appeared
before
Danglars
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
sent
for

he
said
to
the

``

*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
``
Merely

Danglars
felt
a
dreadful
*NL*
spasm
dart
through
his
heart
.
``
But
this
is
all
I
have
left
in
the
*NL*
world

he
said
,
``
out

*NL*
*NL*
``

thought

said

*NL*
*NL*
``
So
I
am
of
these
men

but
there
is
another
over
me

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
did
your

you

excite

require

Be

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
when
I
have
no
more

left
to

asked
the
infuriated
*NL*
Danglars
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
must
suffer
hunger

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Suffer
hunger
?
''
said
Danglars
,
becoming
pale
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Most
likely
,
''
replied
Vampa
coolly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
say
you
do
not

to
kill
me

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
yet
you
will
let

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
that
is
a
different
thing

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
wretches
,
''
cried
Danglars
,
``
I
will
defy
your
infamous
*NL*
calculations
--
I
would
rather
die
at
once
!
You
may
torture
,
torment
,
kill
*NL*
me
,
but
you
shall
not
have
my
signature
again
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
your
excellency
pleases
,
''
said
Vampa
,
as
he
left
the
cell
.
Danglars
,
*NL*
raving
,
threw
himself
on
the
goat-skin
.
Who
could
these
men
be
?
Who
was
*NL*
the
invisible
chief
?
What
could
be
his
intentions
towards
him
?
And
why
,
*NL*
when
every
one
else
was
allowed
to
be
ransomed
,
might
he
not
also
be
?
*NL*
Oh
,
yes
;
certainly
a
speedy
,
violent
death
would
be
a
fine
means
of
*NL*
deceiving
these
remorseless
enemies
,
who
appeared
to
pursue
him
with
*NL*
such
incomprehensible
vengeance
.
But
to
die
?
For
the
first
time
in
his
*NL*
life
,
Danglars
contemplated
death
with
a
mixture
of
dread
and
desire
;
*NL*
the
time
had
come
when
the
implacable
spectre
,
which
exists
in
the
mind
*NL*
of
every
human
creature
,
arrested
his
attention
and
called
out
with
*NL*
every
pulsation
of
his
heart
,
``
Thou
shalt
die
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Danglars
resembled
a
timid
animal
excited
in
the
chase
;
first
it
flies
,
*NL*
then
despairs
,
and
at
last
,
by
the
very
force
of
desperation
,
sometimes
*NL*
succeeds
in
eluding
its
pursuers
.
Danglars
meditated
an
escape
;
but
the
*NL*
walls
were
solid
rock
,
a
man
was
sitting
reading
at
the
only
outlet
to
*NL*
the
cell
,
and
behind
that
man
shapes
armed
with
guns
continually
passed
.
*NL*
His
resolution
not
to
sign
lasted
two
days
,
after
which
he
offered
a
*NL*
million
for
some
food
.
They
sent
him
a
magnificent
supper
,
and
took
his
*NL*
million
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
this
time
the
prisoner
resolved
to
suffer
no
longer
,
but
to
have
*NL*
everything
he
wanted
.
At
the
end
of
twelve
days
,
after
having
made
a
*NL*
splendid
dinner
,
he
reckoned
his
accounts
,
and
found
that
he
had
only
*NL*
50,000
francs
left
.
Then
a
strange
reaction
took
place
;
he
who
had
just
*NL*
abandoned
5,000,000
endeavored
to
save
the
50,000
francs
he
had
left
,
*NL*
and
sooner
than
give
them
up
he
resolved
to
enter
again
upon
a
life
of
*NL*
privation
--
he
was
deluded
by
the
hopefulness
that
is
a
premonition
of
*NL*
madness
.
He
who
for
so
long
a
time
had
forgotten
God
,
began
to
*NL*
think
that
miracles
were
possible
--
that
the
accursed
cavern
might
be
*NL*
discovered
by
the
officers
of
the
Papal
States
,
who
would
release
him
;
*NL*
that
then
he
would
have
50,000
remaining
,
which
would
be
sufficient
to
*NL*
save
him
from
starvation
;
and
finally
he
prayed
that
this
sum
might
*NL*
be
preserved
to
him
,
and
as
he
prayed
he
wept
.
Three
days
passed
thus
,
*NL*
during
which
his
prayers
were
frequent
,
if
not
heartfelt
.
Sometimes
he
*NL*
was
delirious
,
and
fancied
he
saw
an
old
man
stretched
on
a
pallet
;
he
,
*NL*
also
,
was
dying
of
hunger
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
fourth
,
he
was
no
longer
a
man
,
but
a
living
corpse
.
He
had
*NL*
picked
up
every
crumb
that
had
been
left
from
his
former
meals
,
and
was
*NL*
beginning
to
eat
the
matting
which
covered
the
floor
of
his
cell
.
Then
*NL*
he
entreated
Peppino
,
as
he
would
a
guardian
angel
,
to
give
him
food
;
*NL*
he
offered
him
1,000
francs
for
a
mouthful
of
bread
.
But
Peppino
did
not
*NL*
answer
.
On
the
fifth
day
he
dragged
himself
to
the
door
of
the
cell
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
not
a
Christian
?
''
he
said
,
falling
on
his
knees
.
``
Do
you
wish
*NL*
to
assassinate
a
man
who
,
in
the
eyes
of
heaven
,
is
a
brother
?
Oh
,
my
*NL*
former
friends
,
my
former
friends
!
''
he
murmured
,
and
fell
with
his
face
*NL*
to
the
ground
.
Then
rising
in
despair
,
he
exclaimed
,
``
The
chief
,
the
*NL*
chief
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
I
am
,
''
said
Vampa
,
instantly
appearing
;
``
what
do
you
want
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
my
last
gold
,
''
muttered
Danglars
,
holding
out
his
pocket-book
,
*NL*
``
and
let
me
live
here
;
I
ask
no
more
for
liberty
--
I
only
ask
to
live
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
suffer
a
great
deal
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
yes
,
cruelly
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Still
,
there
have
been
men
who
suffered
more
than
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
think
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
those
who
have
died
of
hunger
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Danglars
thought
of
the
old
man
whom
,
in
his
hours
of
delirium
,
he
*NL*
had
seen
groaning
on
his
bed
.
He
struck
his
forehead
on
the
ground
and
*NL*
groaned
.
``
Yes
,
''
he
said
,
``
there
have
been
some
who
have
suffered
more
*NL*
than
I
have
,
but
then
they
must
have
been
martyrs
at
least
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
repent
?
''
asked
a
deep
,
solemn
voice
,
which
caused
Danglars
'
hair
*NL*
to
stand
on
end
.
His
feeble
eyes
endeavored
to
distinguish
objects
,
and
*NL*
behind
the
bandit
he
saw
a
man
enveloped
in
a
cloak
,
half
lost
in
the
*NL*
shadow
of
a
stone
column
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
what
must
I
repent
?
''
stammered
Danglars
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
the
evil
you
have
done
,
''
said
the
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
;
oh
,
yes
,
I
do
indeed
repent
.
''
And
he
struck
his
breast
with
*NL*
his
emaciated
fist
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
forgive
you
,
''
said
the
man
,
dropping
his
cloak
,
and
advancing
to
*NL*
the
light
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Count
of
Monte
Cristo
!
''
said
Danglars
,
more
pale
from
terror
than
*NL*
he
had
been
just
before
from
hunger
and
misery
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
mistaken
--
I
am
not
the
Count
of
Monte
Cristo

*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
who
are
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am

you
sold

dishonored

prostituted

upon

you

yourself

you
condemned

hunger

also
condemned

and
who
yet
*NL*
forgives
you

because

hopes
to
be
forgiven

''
*NL*
Danglars
uttered
a
cry
,
and
fell
prostrate
.
``
Rise
,
''
said
the
count
,
*NL*
``
your
life
is
safe
;
the

good
fortune
has
not
happened
to
your

accomplices

,
the
other
dead

Keep
the
50,000
francs
you
have
*NL*
left

I
give
them
to
you
.
The
5,000,000
you
stole
from
the
hospitals
has
*NL*
been
restored
to
them
by
an
unknown
hand

And
now
eat
and
drink
;
I
will
*NL*
entertain
you
to-night

Vampa
,
when
this
man
is
satisfied
,
let
him
be
*NL*
free

''
Danglars
remained
prostrate
while
the
count
withdrew
;
when
he
*NL*
raised
his
head
he
saw
disappearing
down
the
passage
nothing
but
*NL*
a
shadow
,
before
which
the
bandits
bowed
.
According
to
the
count
's
*NL*
directions
,
Danglars
was
waited
on
by
Vampa
,
who
brought
him
the
best
*NL*
wine
and
fruits
of
Italy
;
then
,
having
conducted
him
to
the
road
,
and
*NL*
pointed
to
the
post-chaise
,
left
him
leaning
against
a
tree
.
He
remained
*NL*
there
all
night
,
not
knowing
where
he
was
.
When
daylight
dawned
he
saw
*NL*
that
he
was
near
a
stream
;
he
was
thirsty
,
and
dragged
himself
towards
*NL*
it
.
As
he
stooped
down
to
drink
,
he
saw
that
his
hair
had
become
*NL*
entirely
white

The
Fifth
of
October

*NL*
*NL*
It
was
about
six
o'clock
in
the
evening
;
an
opal-colored
light
,
through

which
an
autumnal
sun
shed
its
golden
rays
,
descended
on
the
blue
ocean
.
*NL*
The
heat
of
the
day
had
gradually
decreased
,
and
a
light
breeze
arose
,
*NL*
seeming
like
the
respiration
of
nature
on
awakening
from
the
burning
*NL*
siesta
of
the
south
.
A
delicious
zephyr
played
along
the
coasts
of
*NL*
the
Mediterranean
,
and
wafted
from
shore
to
shore
the
sweet
perfume
of
*NL*
plants
,
mingled
with
the
fresh
smell
of
the
sea
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
light
yacht
,
chaste
and
elegant
in
its
form
,
was
gliding
amidst
the
*NL*
first
dews
of
night
over
the
immense
lake
,
extending
from
Gibraltar
to
*NL*
the
Dardanelles
,
and
from
Tunis
to
Venice
.
The
vessel
resembled
a
*NL*
swan
with
its
wings
opened
towards
the
wind
,
gliding
on
the
water
.
It
*NL*
advanced
swiftly
and
gracefully
,
leaving
behind
it
a
glittering
stretch
*NL*
of
foam
.
By
degrees
the
sun
disappeared
behind
the
western
horizon
;
but
*NL*
as
though
to
prove
the
truth
of
the
fanciful
ideas
in
heathen
mythology
,
*NL*
its
indiscreet
rays
reappeared
on
the
summit
of
every
wave
,
as
if
the
*NL*
god
of
fire
had
just
sunk
upon
the
bosom
of
Amphitrite
,
who
in
vain
*NL*
endeavored
to
hide
her
lover
beneath
her
azure
mantle
.
The
yacht
moved
*NL*
rapidly
on
,
though
there
did
not
appear
to
be
sufficient
wind
to
ruffle
*NL*
the
curls
on
the
head
of
a
young
girl
.
Standing
on
the
prow
was
a
tall
*NL*
man
,
of
a
dark
complexion
,
who
saw
with
dilating
eyes
that
they
were
*NL*
approaching
a
dark
mass
of
land
in
the
shape
of
a
cone
,
which
rose
*NL*
from
the
midst
of
the
waves
like
the
hat
of
a
Catalan
.
``
Is
that
Monte
*NL*
Cristo
?
''
asked
the
traveller
,
to
whose
orders
the
yacht
was
for
the
time
*NL*
submitted
,
in
a
melancholy
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
your
excellency
,
''
said
the
captain
,
``
we
have
reached
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
reached
it
!
''
repeated
the
traveller
in
an
accent
of
*NL*
indescribable
sadness
.
Then
he
added
,
in
a
low
tone
,
``
Yes
;
that
is
the
*NL*
haven
.
''
And
then
he
again
plunged
into
a
train
of
thought
,
the
character
*NL*
of
which
was
better
revealed
by
a
sad
smile
,
than
it
would
have
been
by
*NL*
tears
.
A
few
minutes
afterwards
a
flash
of
light
,
which
was
extinguished
*NL*
instantly
,
was
seen
on
the
land
,
and
the
sound
of
firearms
reached
the
*NL*
yacht
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
excellency
,
''
said
the
captain
,
``
that
was
the
land
signal
,
will
you
*NL*
answer
yourself
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
signal
?
''
The
captain
pointed
towards
the
island
,
up
the
side
of
*NL*
which
ascended
a
volume
of
smoke
,
increasing
as
it
rose
.
``
Ah
,
yes
,
''
he
*NL*
said
,
as
if
awaking
from
a
dream
.
``
Give
it
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
captain
gave
him
a
loaded
carbine
;
the
traveller
slowly
raised
it
,
*NL*
and
fired
in
the
air
.
Ten
minutes
afterwards
,
the
sails
were
furled
,
and
*NL*
they
cast
anchor
about
a
hundred
fathoms
from
the
little
harbor
.
The
*NL*
gig
was
already
lowered
,
and
in
it
were
four
oarsmen
and
a
coxswain
.
*NL*
The
traveller
descended
,
and
instead
of
sitting
down
at
the
stern
of
the
*NL*
boat
,
which
had
been
decorated
with
a
blue
carpet
for
his
accommodation
,
*NL*
stood
up
with
his
arms
crossed
.
The
rowers
waited
,
their
oars
half
*NL*
lifted
out
of
the
water
,
like
birds
drying
their
wings
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
way
,
''
said
the
traveller
.
The
eight
oars
fell
into
the
sea
*NL*
simultaneously
without
splashing
a
drop
of
water
,
and
the
boat
,
yielding
*NL*
to
the
impulsion
,
glided
forward
.
In
an
instant
they
found
themselves
*NL*
in
a
little
harbor
,
formed
in
a
natural
creek
;
the
boat
grounded
on
the
*NL*
fine
sand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
your
excellency
be
so
good
as
to
mount
the
shoulders
of
two
of
our
*NL*
men
,
they
will
carry
you
ashore
?
''
The
young
man
answered
this
invitation
*NL*
with
a
gesture
of
indifference
,
and
stepped
out
of
the
boat
;
the
sea
*NL*
immediately
rose
to
his
waist
.
``
Ah
,
your
excellency
,
''
murmured
the
*NL*
pilot
,
``
you
should
not
have
done
so
;
our
master
will
scold
us
for
it
.
''
*NL*
The
young
man
continued
to
advance
,
following
the
sailors
,
who
chose
*NL*
a
firm
footing
.
Thirty
strides
brought
them
to
dry
land
;
the
young
man
*NL*
stamped
on
the
ground
to
shake
off
the
wet
,
and
looked
around
for
some
*NL*
one
to
show
him
his
road
,
for
it
was
quite
dark
.
Just
as
he
turned
,
*NL*
a
hand
rested
on
his
shoulder
,
and
a
voice
which
made
him
shudder
*NL*
exclaimed
,
--
``
Good-evening
,
Maximilian
;
you
are
punctual
,
thank
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
is
it
you
,
count
?
''
said
the
young
man
,
in
an
almost
joyful
accent
,
*NL*
pressing
Monte
Cristo
's
hand
with
both
his
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
you
see
I
am
as
exact
as
you
are
.
But
you
are
dripping
,
my
dear
*NL*
fellow
;
you
must
change
your
clothes
,
as
Calypso
said
to
Telemachus
.
*NL*
Come
,
I
have
a
habitation
prepared
for
you
in
which
you
will
soon
forget
*NL*
fatigue
and
cold
.
''
Monte
Cristo
perceived
that
the
young
man
had
turned
*NL*
around
;
indeed
,
Morrel
saw
with
surprise
that
the
men
who
had
brought
*NL*
him
had
left
without
being
paid
,
or
uttering
a
word
.
Already
the
sound
*NL*
of
their
oars
might
be
heard
as
they
returned
to
the
yacht
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
''
said
the
count
,
``
you
are
looking
for
the
sailors
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
paid
them
nothing
,
and
yet
they
are
gone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
mind
that
,
Maximilian
,
''
said
Monte
Cristo
,
smiling
.
``
I
have
made
*NL*
an
agreement
with
the
navy
,
that
the
access
to
my
island
shall
be
free
*NL*
of
all
charge
.
I
have
made
a
bargain
.
''
Morrel
looked
at
the
count
with
*NL*
surprise
.
``
Count
,
''
he
said
,
``
you
are
not
the
same
here
as
in
Paris
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
you
laugh
.
''
The
count
's
brow
became
clouded
.
``
You
are
right
to
*NL*
recall
me
to
myself
,
Maximilian
,
''
he
said
;
``
I
was
delighted
to
see
you
*NL*
again
,
and
forgot
for
the
moment
that
all
happiness
is
fleeting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
no
,
count
,
''
cried
Maximilian
,
seizing
the
count
's
hands
,
``
pray
*NL*
laugh
;
be
happy
,
and
prove
to
me
,
by
your
indifference
,
that
life
is
*NL*
endurable
to
sufferers
.
Oh
,
how
charitable
,
kind
,
and
good
you
are
;
you
*NL*
affect
this
gayety
to
inspire
me
with
courage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
wrong
,
Morrel
;
I
was
really
happy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
forget
me
,
so
much
the
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
for
as
the
gladiator
said
to
the
emperor
,
when
he
entered
the
*NL*
arena
,
`
He
who
is
about
to
die
salutes
you
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
are
not
consoled
?
''
asked
the
count
,
surprised
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
exclaimed
Morrel
,
with
a
glance
full
of
bitter
reproach
,
``
do
you
*NL*
think
it
possible
that
I
could
be
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
,
''
said
the
count
.
``
Do
you
understand
the
meaning
of
my
words
?
*NL*
You
can
not
take
me
for
a
commonplace
man
,
a
mere
rattle
,
emitting
a
*NL*
vague
and
senseless
noise
.
When
I
ask
you
if
you
are
consoled
,
I
speak
*NL*
to
you
as
a
man
for
whom
the
human
heart
has
no
secrets
.
Well
,
Morrel
,
*NL*
let
us
both
examine
the
depths
of
your
heart
.
Do
you
still
feel
the
same
*NL*
feverish
impatience
of
grief
which
made
you
start
like
a
wounded
lion
?
*NL*
Have
you
still
that
devouring
thirst
which
can
only
be
appeased
in
the
*NL*
grave
?
Are
you
still
actuated
by
the
regret
which
drags
the
living
to
*NL*
the
pursuit
of
death
;
or
are
you
only
suffering
from
the
prostration
*NL*
of
fatigue
and
the
weariness
of
hope
deferred
?
Has
the
loss
of
memory
*NL*
rendered
it
impossible
for
you
to
weep
?
Oh
,
my
dear
friend
,
if
this
be
*NL*
the
case
,
--
if
you
can
no
longer
weep
,
if
your
frozen
heart
be
dead
,
if
*NL*
you
put
all
your
trust
in
God
,
then
,
Maximilian
,
you
are
consoled
--
do
*NL*
not
complain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Count
,
''
said
Morrel
,
in
a
firm
and
at
the
same
time
soft
voice
,
``
listen
*NL*
to
me
,
as
to
a
man
whose
thoughts
are
raised
to
heaven
,
though
he
*NL*
remains
on
earth
;
I
come
to
die
in
the
arms
of
a
friend
.
Certainly
,
*NL*
there
are
people
whom
I
love
.
I
love
my
sister
Julie
,
--
I
love
her
*NL*
husband
Emmanuel
;
but
I
require
a
strong
mind
to
smile
on
my
last
*NL*
moments
.
My
sister
would
be
bathed
in
tears
and
fainting
;
I
could
not
*NL*
bear
to
see
her
suffer
.
Emmanuel
would
tear
the
weapon
from
my
hand
,
and
*NL*
alarm
the
house
with
his
cries
.
You
,
count
,
who
are
more
than
mortal
,
*NL*
will
,
I
am
sure

lead
me
to
death
by
a
pleasant
path

will
you
not

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
friend

''
said
the
count

``
I
have
still
one
doubt

are
you
weak
*NL*
enough
to
pride
yourself
upon
your
sufferings
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
indeed
,
--
I
am
calm
,

said
Morrel
,
giving
his
hand
to
the
count
;
``
my
*NL*
pulse
does
not
beat
slower
or
faster
than
usual
.
No
,
I
feel
that
I
have
*NL*
reached
the
goal
,
and
I
will
go
no
farther
.
You
told
me
to
wait
and
*NL*
hope
;
do
you
know
what
you
did
,
unfortunate
adviser
?
I
waited
a
month
,
*NL*
or
rather
I
suffered
for
a
month
!
I
did
hope
-LRB-
man
is
a
poor
wretched
*NL*
creature
-RRB-
,
I
did
hope
.
What
I
can
not
tell
,
--
something
wonderful
,
an
*NL*
absurdity
,
a
miracle
,
--
of
what
nature
he
alone
can
tell
who
has
mingled
*NL*
with
our
reason
that
folly
we
call
hope
.
Yes
,
I
did
wait
--
yes
,
I
did
*NL*
hope
,
count
,
and
during
this
quarter
of
an
hour
we
have
been
talking
*NL*
together
,
you
have
unconsciously
wounded
,
tortured
my
heart
,
for
every
*NL*
word
you
have
uttered
proved
that
there
was
no
hope
for
me
.
Oh
,
count
,
*NL*
I
shall
sleep
calmly
,
deliciously
in
the
arms
of
death
.
''
Morrel
uttered
*NL*
these
words
with
an
energy
which
made
the
count
shudder
.
``
My
friend
,
''
*NL*
continued
Morrel
,
``
you
named
the
fifth
of
October
as
the
end
of
the
*NL*
period
of
waiting
,
--
to-day
is
the
fifth
of
October
,
''
he
took
out
his
*NL*
watch
,
``
it
is
now
nine
o'clock
,
--
I
have
yet
three
hours
to
live
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
it
so
,
''
said
the
count
,
``
come
.
''
Morrel
mechanically
followed
the
*NL*
count
,
and
they
had
entered
the
grotto
before
he
perceived
it
.
He
felt
*NL*
a
carpet
under
his
feet
,
a
door
opened
,
perfumes
surrounded
him
,
and
*NL*
a
brilliant
light
dazzled
his
eyes
.
Morrel
hesitated
to
advance
;
he
*NL*
dreaded
the
enervating
effect
of
all
that
he
saw
.
Monte
Cristo
drew
him
*NL*
in
gently
.
``
Why
should
we
not
spend
the
last
three
hours
remaining
to
*NL*
us
of
life
,
like
those
ancient
Romans
,
who
when
condemned
by
Nero
,
their
*NL*
emperor
and
heir
,
sat
down
at
a
table
covered
with
flowers
,
and
gently
*NL*
glided
into
death
,
amid
the
perfume
of
heliotropes
and
roses
?
''
Morrel
*NL*
smiled
.
``
As
you
please
,
''
he
said
;
``
death
is
always
death
,
--
that
is
*NL*
forgetfulness
,
repose
,
exclusion
from
life
,
and
therefore
from
grief
.
''
*NL*
He
sat
down
,
and
Monte
Cristo
placed
himself
opposite
to
him
.
They
were
*NL*
in
the
marvellous
dining-room
before
described
,
where
the
statues
had
*NL*
baskets
on
their
heads
always
filled
with
fruits
and
flowers
.
Morrel
had
*NL*
looked
carelessly
around
,
and
had
probably
noticed
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
talk
like
men
,
''
he
said
,
looking
at
the
count
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
on
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Count
,
''
said
Morrel
,
``
you
are
the
epitome
of
all
human
knowledge
,
and
*NL*
you
seem
like
a
being
descended
from
a
wiser
and
more
advanced
world
*NL*
than
ours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
something
true
in
what
you
say
,

said
the
count
,
with
that
*NL*
smile
which
made
him
so
handsome
;
``
I
have
descended
from
a
planet
called
*NL*
grief

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
all
you
tell
me
without
questioning
its
meaning

for
*NL*
instance

you
told
me
to

and
I
did
live
;
you
told
me
to
hope

*NL*
and
I
almost
did
so

I
am
almost
inclined
to
ask
you
,
as
though
you
had
*NL*
experienced
death
,
`
is
it
painful
to
die

''
*NL*
*NL*
Monte
Cristo
looked
upon
Morrel
with
indescribable
tenderness
.
``
Yes
,
''
*NL*
he
said
,
``
yes
,
doubtless
it
is
painful
,
if
you
violently
break
the
outer
*NL*
covering
which
obstinately
begs

If
you
plunge
a
dagger
into
*NL*
your
flesh
,
if
you
insinuate
a
bullet
into
your
brain
,
which
the
least
*NL*
shock
disorders
,
--
then
certainly
,
you
will
suffer
pain
,
and
you
will
*NL*
repent
quitting
a
life
for
a
repose
you
have
bought
at
so
dear
a
price
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
I
know
that
there
is
a
secret
of
luxury
and
pain
in
death
,
as
well
*NL*
as
in
life
;
the
only
thing
is
to
understand
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
spoken
truly
,
Maximilian
;
according
to
the
care
we
bestow
upon
*NL*
it
,
death
is
either
a
friend
who
rocks
us
gently
as
a
nurse
,
or
an
enemy
*NL*
who
violently
drags
the
soul
from
the
body
.
Some
day
,
when
the
world
*NL*
is
much
older
,
and
when
mankind
will
be
masters
of
all
the
destructive
*NL*
powers
in
nature
,
to
serve
for
the
general
good
of
humanity
;
when
*NL*
mankind
,
as
you
were
just
saying
,
have
discovered
the
secrets
of
death
,
*NL*
then
that
death
will
become
as
sweet
and
voluptuous
as
a
slumber
in
the
*NL*
arms
of
your
beloved
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
if
you
wished
to
die
,
you
would
choose
this
death
,
count
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Morrel
extended
his
hand
.
``
Now
I
understand
,
''
he
said
,
``
why
you
had
me
*NL*
brought
here
to
this
desolate
spot
,
in
the
midst
of
the
ocean
,
to
this
*NL*
subterranean
palace
;
it
was
because
you
loved
me
,
was
it
not
,
count
?
It
*NL*
was
because
you
loved
me
well
enough
to
give
me
one
of
those
sweet
means
*NL*
of
death
of
which
we
were
speaking
;
a
death
without
agony
,
a
death
which
*NL*
allows
me
to
fade
away
while
pronouncing
Valentine
's
name
and
pressing
*NL*
your
hand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
you
have
guessed
rightly
,
Morrel
,
''
said
the
count
,
``
that
is
what
I
*NL*
intended
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thanks
;
the
idea
that
tomorrow
I
shall
no
longer
suffer
,
is
sweet
to
my
*NL*
heart
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
then
regret
nothing
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
replied
Morrel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
even
me
?
''
asked
the
count
with
deep
emotion
.
Morrel
's
clear
eye
was
*NL*
for
the
moment
clouded
,
then
it
shone
with
unusual
lustre
,
and
a
large
*NL*
tear
rolled
down
his
cheek
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
''
said
the
count
,
``
do
you
still
regret
anything
in
the
world
,
and
*NL*
yet
die
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
entreat
you
,
''
exclaimed
Morrel
in
a
low
voice
,
``
do
not
speak
*NL*
another
word
,
count
;
do
not
prolong
my
punishment
.
''
The
count
fancied
*NL*
that
he
was
yielding
,
and
this
belief
revived
the
horrible
doubt
that
*NL*
had
overwhelmed
him
at
the
Chateau
d'If
.
``
I
am
endeavoring
,
''
he
thought
,
*NL*
``
to
make
this
man
happy
;
I
look
upon
this
restitution
as
a
weight
thrown
*NL*
into
the
scale
to
balance
the
evil
I
have
wrought
.
Now
,
supposing
I
*NL*
am
deceived
,
supposing
this
man
has
not
been
unhappy
enough
to
merit
*NL*
happiness
.
Alas
,
what
would
become
of
me
who
can
only
atone
for
evil
by
*NL*
doing
good
?
''
Then
he
said
aloud
:
``
Listen
,
Morrel
,
I
see
your
grief
*NL*
is
great
,
but
still
you
do
not
like
to
risk
your
soul
.
''
Morrel
smiled
*NL*
sadly
.
``
Count
,
''
he
said
,
``
I
swear
to
you
my
soul
is
no
longer
my
own
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Maximilian
,
you
know
I
have
no
relation
in
the
world

I
have
accustomed
*NL*
myself
to
regard
you
as
my
son
:
well
,
then
,
to
save
my
son
,
I
will
*NL*
sacrifice
my
life
,
nay
,
even
my
fortune
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
mean
,
that
you
wish
to
quit
life
because
you
do
not
understand
*NL*
all
the
enjoyments
which
are
the
fruits
of
a
large
fortune
.
Morrel
,
I
*NL*
possess
nearly
a
hundred
millions
and
I
give
them
to
you
;
with
such
a
*NL*
fortune
you
can
attain
every
wish
.
Are
you
ambitious
?
Every
career
is
*NL*
open
to
you
.
Overturn
the
world
,
change
its
character
,
yield
to
mad
*NL*
ideas
,
be
even
criminal
--
but
live

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Count
,
I
have
your
word
,
''
said
Morrel
coldly
;
then
taking
out
his
*NL*
watch
,
he
added
,
``
It
is
half-past
eleven
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Morrel
,
can
you
intend
it
in
my
house
,
under
my
very
eyes
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
let
me
go
,
''
said
Maximilian
,
``
or
I
shall
think
you
did
not
love
me
*NL*
for
my
own
sake
,
but
for
yours
;
''
and
he
arose
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
well
,
''
said
Monte
Cristo
whose
countenance
brightened
at
these
*NL*
words
;
``
you
wish
--
you
are
inflexible
.
Yes
,
as
you
said
,
you
are
indeed
*NL*
wretched
and
a
miracle
alone
can
cure
you
.
Sit
down
,
Morrel
,
and
wait
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Morrel
obeyed
;
the
count
arose
,
and
unlocking
a
closet
with
a
key
*NL*
suspended
from
his
gold
chain
,
took
from
it
a
little
silver
casket
,
*NL*
beautifully
carved
and
chased
,
the
corners
of
which
represented
four
*NL*
bending
figures
,
similar
to
the
Caryatides
,
the
forms
of
women
,
symbols
*NL*
of
the
angels
aspiring
to
heaven
.
He
placed
the
casket
on
the
table
;
*NL*
then
opening
it
took
out
a
little
golden
box
,
the
top
of
which
flew
*NL*
open
when
touched
by
a
secret
spring
.
This
box
contained
an
unctuous
*NL*
substance
partly
solid
,
of
which
it
was
impossible
to
discover
the
*NL*
color
,
owing
to
the
reflection
of
the
polished
gold
,
sapphires
,
rubies
,
*NL*
emeralds
,
which
ornamented
the
box
.
It
was
a
mixed
mass
of
blue
,
red
,
*NL*
and
gold
.
The
count
took
out
a
small
quantity
of
this
with
a
gilt
spoon
,
*NL*
and
offered
it
to
Morrel
,
fixing
a
long
steadfast
glance
upon
him
.
It
*NL*
was
then
observable
that
the
substance
was
greenish
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
what
you
asked
for
,
''
he
said
,
``
and
what
I
promised
to
give
*NL*
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thank
you
from
the
depths
of
my
heart
,
''
said
the
young
man
,
taking
*NL*
the
spoon
from
the
hands
of
Monte
Cristo
.
The
count
took
another
spoon
,
*NL*
and
again
dipped
it
into
the
golden
box
.
``
What
are
you
going
to
do
,
my
*NL*
friend
?
''
asked
Morrel
,
arresting
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
the
fact
is
,
Morrel
,
I
was
thinking
that
I
too
am
weary
of
life
,
*NL*
and
since
an
opportunity
presents
itself
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stay
!
''
said
the
young
man
.
``
You
who
love
,
and
are
beloved
;
you
,
who
*NL*
have
faith
and
hope
,
--
oh
,
do
not
follow
my
example
.
In
your
case
it
*NL*
would
be
a
crime
.
Adieu
,
my
noble
and
generous
friend
,
adieu
;
I
will
*NL*
go
and
tell
Valentine
what
you
have
done
for
me
.
''
And
slowly
,
though
*NL*
without
any
hesitation
,
only
waiting
to
press
the
count
's
hand
*NL*
fervently
,
he
swallowed
the
mysterious
substance
offered
by
Monte
*NL*
Cristo
.
Then
they
were
both
silent
.
Ali
,
mute
and
attentive
,
brought
the
*NL*
pipes
and
coffee
,
and
disappeared
.
By
degrees
,
the
light
of
the
lamps
*NL*
gradually
faded
in
the
hands
of
the
marble
statues
which
held
them
,
and
*NL*
the
perfumes
appeared
less
powerful
to
Morrel
.
Seated
opposite
to
him
,
*NL*
Monte
Cristo
watched
him
in
the
shadow
,
and
Morrel
saw
nothing
but
the
*NL*
bright
eyes
of
the
count
.
An
overpowering
sadness
took
possession
of
*NL*
the
young
man
,
his
hands
relaxed
their
hold
,
the
objects
in
the
room
*NL*
gradually
lost
their
form
and
color
,
and
his
disturbed
vision
seemed
to
*NL*
perceive
doors
and
curtains
open
in
the
walls
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Friend
,
''
he
cried
,
``
I
feel
that
I
am
dying
;
thanks
!
''
He
made
a
last
*NL*
effort
to
extend
his
hand
,
but
it
fell
powerless
beside
him
.
Then
it
*NL*
appeared
to
him
that
Monte
Cristo
smiled
,
not
with
the
strange
and
*NL*
fearful
expression
which
had
sometimes
revealed
to
him
the
secrets
of
*NL*
his
heart
,
but
with
the
benevolent
kindness
of
a
father
for
a
child
.
*NL*
At
the
same
time
the
count
appeared
to
increase
in
stature
,
his
form
,
*NL*
nearly
double
its
usual
height
,
stood
out
in
relief
against
the
red
*NL*
tapestry
,
his
black
hair
was
thrown
back
,
and
he
stood
in
the
attitude
*NL*
of
an
avenging
angel
.
Morrel
,
overpowered
,
turned
around
in
the
*NL*
arm-chair
;
a
delicious
torpor
permeated
every
vein
.
A
change
of
*NL*
ideas
presented
themselves
to
his
brain
,
like
a
new
design
on
*NL*
the
kaleidoscope
.
Enervated
,
prostrate
,
and
breathless
,
he
became
*NL*
unconscious
of
outward
objects
;
he
seemed
to
be
entering
that
vague
*NL*
delirium
preceding
death
.
He
wished
once
again
to
press
the
count
's
*NL*
hand
,
but
his
own
was
immovable
.
He
wished
to
articulate
a
last
*NL*
farewell
,
but
his
tongue
lay
motionless
and
heavy
in
his
throat
,
like
*NL*
a
stone
at
the
mouth
of
a
sepulchre
.
Involuntarily
his
languid
eyes
*NL*
closed
,
and
still
through
his
eyelashes
a
well-known
form
seemed
to
move
*NL*
amid
the
obscurity
with
which
he
thought
himself
enveloped
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
count
had
just
opened
a
door
.
Immediately
a
brilliant
light
from
the
*NL*
next
room
,
or
rather
from
the
palace
adjoining
,
shone
upon
the
room
in
*NL*
which
he
was
gently
gliding
into
his
last
sleep
.
Then
he
saw
a
woman
of
*NL*
marvellous
beauty
appear
on
the
threshold
of
the
door
separating
the
*NL*
two
rooms
.
Pale
,
and
sweetly
smiling
,
she
looked
like
an
angel
of
mercy
*NL*
conjuring
the
angel
of
vengeance
.
``
Is
it
heaven
that
opens
before
me
?
''
*NL*
thought
the
dying
man
;
``
that
angel
resembles
the
one
I
have
lost
.
''
Monte
*NL*
Cristo
pointed
out
Morrel
to
the
young
woman
,
who
advanced
towards
him
*NL*
with
clasped
hands
and
a
smile
upon
her
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Valentine
,
Valentine
!
''
he
mentally
ejaculated
;
but
his
lips
uttered
*NL*
no
sound
,
and
as
though
all
his
strength
were
centred
in
that
internal
*NL*
emotion
,
he
sighed
and
closed
his
eyes
.
Valentine
rushed
towards
him
;
*NL*
his
lips
again
moved
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
calling
you
,
''
said
the
count
;
``
he
to
whom
you
have
confided
your
*NL*
destiny
--
he
from
whom
death
would
have
separated
you
,
calls
you
to
him
.
*NL*
Happily
,
I
vanquished
death
.
Henceforth
,
Valentine
,
you
will
never
*NL*
again
be
separated
on
earth
,
since
he
has
rushed
into
death
to
find
you
.
*NL*
Without
me
,
you
would
both
have
died
.
May
God
accept
my
atonement
in
the
*NL*
preservation
of
these
two
existences
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Valentine
seized
the
count
's
hand
,
and
in
her
irresistible
impulse
of
*NL*
joy
carried
it
to
her
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
thank
me
again
!
''
said
the
count
;
``
tell
me
till
you
are
weary
,
that
*NL*
I
have
restored
you
to
happiness
;

do
not
know
how
much
I
require
*NL*
this
assurance

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

yes

yes

I
thank
you

all
my
heart

said
Valentine
;
``

you
doubt
the
sincerity

my
gratitude

oh

ask
Haidee

*NL*
beloved
sister
Haidee
,
who
ever
since
our
departure
from
France
,
has
*NL*
caused
me
to
wait
patiently
for

happy
day

while
talking
to
me
of

you

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
then
love
Haidee

asked
Monte
Cristo
with
an
emotion
he
in
vain
*NL*
endeavored
to
dissimulate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes

with
all
my
soul

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

said
the
count
;

I
have
a
favor

of

*NL*
``
Of

happy
enough

``
Yes

become

indeed

-LRB-
the
count
's
voice
was
thick
with
emotion
-RRB-
``
henceforth
*NL*
she
will
be
alone
in
the
world

*NL*
*NL*
``
Alone

''
repeated
a
voice
behind
the
count
,
``
and
why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Monte
Cristo
turned
around
;
Haidee
was
standing
pale
,
motionless
,
*NL*
looking
at
the
count
with
an
expression
of
fearful
amazement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
to-morrow

you
will
be
free

your

will
not
allow
my

overshadow
yours

Daughter

I
restore
to
you
the
riches

*NL*
*NL*
Haidee
became
pale
,
and
lifting
her
transparent
hands
to
heaven
,
*NL*
exclaimed
in
a
voice
stifled
with
tears
,
``
Then
you
leave
me

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``

And
she
stepped
back
to
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
heavens
,
''
exclaimed
Valentine
,
who
was
supporting
the
head
of
*NL*
Morrel
on
her
shoulder
,
``
do
you
not
see
how
pale
she
is
?
Do
you
not
see
*NL*
how
she
suffers
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Haidee
answered
with
a
heartrending
expression
,
``
Why
should
he
*NL*
understand
this
,
my
sister
?
He
is
my
master
,
and
I
am
his
slave
;
he
has
*NL*
the
right
to
notice
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
count
shuddered
at
the
tones
of
a
voice
which
penetrated
the
inmost
*NL*
recesses
of
his
heart
;
his
eyes
met
those
of
the
young
girl
and
he
could
*NL*
not
bear
their
brilliancy
.
``
Oh
,
heavens
,
''
exclaimed
Monte
Cristo
,
``
can
*NL*
my
suspicions
be
correct
?
Haidee
,
would
it
please
you
not
to
leave
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
young
,
''
gently
replied
Haidee
;
``
I
love
the
life
you
have
made
so
*NL*
sweet
to
me
,
and
I
should
be
sorry
to
die
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
mean
,
then
,
that
if
I
leave
you
,
Haidee

--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
die
;
yes
,
my
lord
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
then
love
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Valentine
,
he
asks
if
I
love
him
.
Valentine
,
tell
him
if
you
love
*NL*
Maximilian

''
The
count
felt
his
heart
dilate
and
throb
;
he
opened
his
*NL*
arms
,
and
Haidee
,
uttering
a
cry
,
sprang
into
them
.
``
Oh
,
yes
,
''
she
*NL*
cried
,
``
I
do
love
you
!
I
love
you
as
one
loves
a
father

you

*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
it
be

God
has
sustained
me
in
my

with
my
enemies

and
has
given
me
this
reward

he
will
not
let
*NL*
me
end
my
triumph
in
suffering
;
I
wished
to
punish
myself
,
but
he
has
*NL*
pardoned
me
.
Love
me
then
,
Haidee
!
Who
knows
?
perhaps
your
love
will
*NL*
make
me
forget
all
that
I
do
not
wish
to
remember

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean

my
lord

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
mean

enlightened

twenty

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
hear
him
,
Valentine

''
exclaimed
Haidee
;
``
he
says
that
through
me
*NL*
he
will
suffer

through
me

who
would
yield
my
life
for

''
The
count
*NL*
withdrew
for
a
moment
.
``
Have
I
discovered
the
truth
?
''
he
said
;
``
but
*NL*
whether
it
be
for
recompense
or
punishment
,
I
accept
my
fate

Come

*NL*
Haidee
,
come
!
''
and
throwing
his
arm
around
the
young
girl
's
waist
,
he
*NL*
pressed
the
hand
of
Valentine
,
and
disappeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
hour
had
nearly
passed
,
during
which
Valentine
,
breathless
and
*NL*
motionless
,
watched
steadfastly
over
Morrel
.
At
length
she
felt
his
*NL*
heart
beat
,
a
faint
breath
played
upon
his
lips
,
a
slight
shudder
,
*NL*
announcing
the
return
of
life
,
passed
through
the
young
man
's
frame
.
At
*NL*
length
his
eyes
opened
,
but
they
were
at
first
fixed
and
expressionless
;
*NL*
then
sight
returned
,
and
with
it
feeling
and
grief
.
``
Oh
,
''
he
cried
,
in
*NL*
an
accent
of
despair
,
``
the
count
has
deceived
me
;
I
am
yet
living
;
''
and
*NL*
extending
his
hand
towards
the
table
,
he
seized
a
knife
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dearest
,
''
exclaimed
Valentine
,
with
her
adorable
smile
,
``
awake
,
and
*NL*
look
at
me
!
''
Morrel
uttered
a
loud
exclamation
,
and
frantic
,
doubtful
,
*NL*
dazzled
,
as
though
by
a
celestial
vision
,
he
fell
upon
his
knees
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
morning
at
daybreak
,
Valentine
and
Morrel
were
walking
*NL*
arm-in-arm
on
the
sea-shore
,
Valentine
relating
how
Monte
Cristo
had
*NL*
appeared
in
her
room
,
explained
everything
,
revealed
the
crime
,
and
,
*NL*
finally
,
how
he
had
saved
her
life
by
enabling
her
to
simulate
death
.
*NL*
They
had
found
the
door
of
the
grotto
opened
,
and
gone
forth
;
on
the
*NL*
azure
dome
of
heaven
still
glittered
a
few
remaining
stars
.
Morrel
soon
*NL*
perceived
a
man
standing
among
the
rocks
,
apparently
awaiting
a
sign
*NL*
from
them
to
advance
,
and
pointed
him
out
to
Valentine
.
``
Ah
,
it
is
*NL*
Jacopo
,
''
she
said
,
``
the
captain
of
the
yacht
;
''
and
she
beckoned
him
*NL*
towards
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
wish
to
speak
to
us
?
''
asked
Morrel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
a
letter
to
give
you
from
the
count
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
the
count
!
''
murmured
the
two
young
people
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
read
it
.
''
Morrel
opened
the
letter
,
and
read
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
Dear
Maximilian
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
a
felucca
for
you
at
anchor
.
Jacopo
will
carry
you
to
Leghorn
,
*NL*
where
Monsieur
Noirtier
awaits
his
granddaughter
,
whom
he
wishes
to
*NL*
bless
before
you
lead
her
to
the
altar
.
All
that
is
in
this
grotto
,
my
*NL*
friend
,
my
house
in
the
Champs
Elysees
,
and
my
chateau
at
Treport
,
are
*NL*
the
marriage
gifts
bestowed
by
Edmond
Dantes
upon
the
son
of
his
old
*NL*
master
,
Morrel
.
Mademoiselle
de
Villefort
will
share
them
with
you
;
for
*NL*
I
entreat
her
to
give
to
the
poor
the
immense
fortune
reverting
to
her
*NL*
from
her
father
,
now
a
madman
,
and
her
brother
who
died
last
September
*NL*
with
his
mother
.
Tell
the
angel
who
will
watch
over
your
future
destiny
,
*NL*
Morrel
,
to
pray
sometimes
for
a
man
,
who
like
Satan
thought
himself
*NL*
for
an
instant
equal
to
God
,
but
who
now
acknowledges
with
Christian
*NL*
humility
that
God
alone
possesses
supreme
power
and
infinite
wisdom
.
*NL*
Perhaps
those
prayers
may
soften
the
remorse
he
feels
in
his
heart
.
As
*NL*
for
you
,
Morrel
,
this
is
the
secret
of
my
conduct
towards
you
.
There
is
*NL*
neither
happiness
nor
misery
in
the
world
;
there
is
only
the
comparison
*NL*
of
one
state
with
another
,
nothing
more
.
He
who
has
felt
the
deepest
*NL*
grief
is
best
able
to
experience
supreme
happiness
.
We
must
have
felt
*NL*
what
it
is
to
die
,
Morrel
,
that
we
may
appreciate
the
enjoyments
of
*NL*
living
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Live
,
then
,
and
be
happy
,
beloved
children
of
my
heart
,
and
never
*NL*
forget
that
until
the
day
when
God
shall
deign
to
reveal
the
future
*NL*
to
man
,
all
human
wisdom
is
summed
up
in
these
two
words

During
the
perusal
of
this
letter
,
which
informed
Valentine
for
the
*NL*
first
time
of
the
madness
of
her
father
and
the
death
of
her
brother
,
*NL*
she
became
pale
,
a
heavy
sigh
escaped
from
her
bosom
,
and
tears
,
not
*NL*
the
less
painful
because
they
were
silent
,
ran
down
her
cheeks
;
her
*NL*
happiness
cost
her
very
dear
.
Morrel
looked
around
uneasily
.
``
But
,
''
he
*NL*
said
,
``
the
count
's
generosity
is
too
overwhelming

Valentine

satisfied
with

Where

Jacopo
pointed
towards
the
horizon

``
What
do

asked
*NL*
Valentine

``
Where

Jacopo

*NL*
*NL*
The
eyes

both
were
fixed
upon
the
spot
indicated
by
the
sailor
,
and
*NL*
on
the
blue
line
separating
the
sky
from
the
Mediterranean
Sea
,
they
*NL*
perceived
a
large
white
sail

``
Gone

Morrel
;
