PREFACE
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
month
of
August
,
1841
,
I
attended
an
anti-slavery
convention
*NL*
in
Nantucket
,
at
which
it
was
my
happiness
to
become
acquainted
with
*NL*
_
Frederick
Douglass
_
,
the
writer
of
the
following
Narrative
.
He
was
a
*NL*
stranger
to
nearly
every
member
of
that
body
;
but
,
having
recently
made
*NL*
his
escape
from
the
southern
prison-house
of
bondage
,
and
feeling
*NL*
his
curiosity
excited
to
ascertain
the
principles
and
measures
of
the
*NL*
abolitionists
,
--
of
whom
he
had
heard
a
somewhat
vague
description
while
*NL*
he
was
a
slave
,
--
he
was
induced
to
give
his
attendance
,
on
the
occasion
*NL*
alluded
to
,
though
at
that
time
a
resident
in
New
Bedford
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fortunate
,
most
fortunate
occurrence
!
--
fortunate
for
the
millions
of
*NL*
his
manacled
brethren
,
yet
panting
for
deliverance
from
their
awful
*NL*
thraldom
!
--
fortunate
for
the
cause
of
negro
emancipation
,
and
of
*NL*
universal
liberty
!
--
fortunate
for
the
land
of
his
birth
,
which
he
has
*NL*
already
done
so
much
to
save
and
bless
!
--
fortunate
for
a
large
circle
of
*NL*
friends
and
acquaintances
,
whose
sympathy
and
affection
he
has
strongly
*NL*
secured
by
the
many
sufferings
he
has
endured
,
by
his
virtuous
traits
of
*NL*
character
,
by
his
ever-abiding
remembrance
of
those
who
are
in
bonds
,
as
*NL*
being
bound
with
them
!
--
fortunate
for
the
multitudes
,
in
various
parts
of
*NL*
our
republic
,
whose
minds
he
has
enlightened
on
the
subject
of
slavery
,
*NL*
and
who
have
been
melted
to
tears
by
his
pathos
,
or
roused
to
virtuous
*NL*
indignation
by
his
stirring
eloquence
against
the
enslavers
of
*NL*
men
!
--
fortunate
for
himself
,
as
it
at
once
brought
him
into
the
field
of
*NL*
public
usefulness
,
``
gave
the
world
assurance
of
a
MAN
,
''
quickened
the
*NL*
slumbering
energies
of
his
soul
,
and
consecrated
him
to
the
great
work
*NL*
of
breaking
the
rod
of
the
oppressor
,
and
letting
the
oppressed
go
free
!
*NL*
*NL*
I
shall
never
forget
his
first
speech
at
the
convention
--
the
*NL*
extraordinary
emotion
it
excited
in
my
own
mind
--
the
powerful
impression
*NL*
it
created
upon
a
crowded
auditory
,
completely
taken
by
surprise
--
the
*NL*
applause
which
followed
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
of
his
felicitous
*NL*
remarks
.
I
think
I
never
hated
slavery
so
intensely
as
at
that
moment
;
*NL*
certainly
,
my
perception
of
the
enormous
outrage
which
is
inflicted
by
*NL*
it
,
on
the
godlike
nature
of
its
victims
,
was
rendered
far
more
*NL*
clear
than
ever
.
There
stood
one
,
in
physical
proportion
and
stature
*NL*
commanding
and
exact
--
in
intellect
richly
endowed
--
in
natural
eloquence
*NL*
a
prodigy
--
in
soul
manifestly
``
created
but
a
little
lower
than
the
*NL*
angels
''
--
yet
a
slave
,
ay
,
a
fugitive
slave
,
--
trembling
for
his
safety
,
*NL*
hardly
daring
to
believe
that
on
the
American
soil
,
a
single
white
*NL*
person
could
be
found
who
would
befriend
him
at
all
hazards
,
for
the
*NL*
love
of
God
and
humanity
!
Capable
of
high
attainments
as
an
intellectual
*NL*
and
moral
being
--
needing
nothing
but
a
comparatively
small
amount
of
*NL*
cultivation
to
make
him
an
ornament
to
society
and
a
blessing
to
his
*NL*
race
--
by
the
law
of
the
land
,
by
the
voice
of
the
people
,
by
the
terms
*NL*
of
the
slave
code
,
he
was
only
a
piece
of
property
,
a
beast
of
burden
,
a
*NL*
chattel
personal
,
nevertheless
!
*NL*
*NL*
A
beloved
friend
from
New
Bedford
prevailed
on
_
Mr.
Douglass
_
to
address
*NL*
the
convention
:
He
came
forward
to
the
platform
with
a
hesitancy
and
*NL*
embarrassment
,
necessarily
the
attendants
of
a
sensitive
mind
in
such
a
*NL*
novel
position
.
After
apologizing
for
his
ignorance
,
and
reminding
the
*NL*
audience
that
slavery
was
a
poor
school
for
the
human
intellect
and
*NL*
heart
,
he
proceeded
to
narrate
some
of
the
facts
in
his
own
history
as
*NL*
a
slave
,
and
in
the
course
of
his
speech
gave
utterance
to
many
noble
*NL*
thoughts
and
thrilling
reflections
.
As
soon
as
he
had
taken
his
seat
,
*NL*
filled
with
hope
and
admiration
,
I
rose
,
and
declared
that
_
Patrick
*NL*
Henry
_
,
of
revolutionary
fame
,
never
made
a
speech
more
eloquent
in
the
*NL*
cause
of
liberty
,
than
the
one
we
had
just
listened
to
from
the
lips
of
*NL*
that
hunted
fugitive
.
So
I
believed
at
that
time
--
such
is
my
belief
*NL*
now
.
I
reminded
the
audience
of
the
peril
which
surrounded
this
*NL*
self-emancipated
young
man
at
the
North
,
--
even
in
Massachusetts
,
on
the
*NL*
soil
of
the
Pilgrim
Fathers
,
among
the
descendants
of
revolutionary
*NL*
sires
;
and
I
appealed
to
them
,
whether
they
would
ever
allow
him
to
*NL*
be
carried
back
into
slavery
,
--
law
or
no
law
,
constitution
or
no
*NL*
constitution
.
The
response
was
unanimous
and
in
thunder-tones
--
``
NO
!
''
*NL*
``
Will
you
succor
and
protect
him
as
a
brother-man
--
a
resident
of
the
old
*NL*
Bay
State
?
''
``
YES
!
''
shouted
the
whole
mass
,
with
an
energy
so
startling
,
*NL*
that
the
ruthless
tyrants
south
of
Mason
and
Dixon
's
line
might
almost
*NL*
have
heard
the
mighty
burst
of
feeling
,
and
recognized
it
as
the
pledge
*NL*
of
an
invincible
determination
,
on
the
part
of
those
who
gave
it
,
never
*NL*
to
betray
him
that
wanders
,
but
to
hide
the
outcast
,
and
firmly
to
abide
*NL*
the
consequences
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
at
once
deeply
impressed
upon
my
mind
,
that
,
if
_
Mr.
Douglass
_
*NL*
could
be
persuaded
to
consecrate
his
time
and
talents
to
the
promotion
*NL*
of
the
anti-slavery
enterprise
,
a
powerful
impetus
would
be
given
to
*NL*
it
,
and
a
stunning
blow
at
the
same
time
inflicted
on
northern
prejudice
*NL*
against
a
colored
complexion
.
I
therefore
endeavored
to
instil
hope
*NL*
and
courage
into
his
mind
,
in
order
that
he
might
dare
to
engage
in
a
*NL*
vocation
so
anomalous
and
responsible
for
a
person
in
his
situation
;
and
*NL*
I
was
seconded
in
this
effort
by
warm-hearted
friends
,
especially
by
the
*NL*
late
General
Agent
of
the
Massachusetts
Anti-Slavery
Society
,
_
Mr.
John
*NL*
A.
Collins
_
,
whose
judgment
in
this
instance
entirely
coincided
with
*NL*
my
own
.
At
first
,
he
could
give
no
encouragement
;
with
unfeigned
*NL*
diffidence
,
he
expressed
his
conviction
that
he
was
not
adequate
to
*NL*
the
performance
of
so
great
a
task
;
the
path
marked
out
was
wholly
an
*NL*
untrodden
one
;
he
was
sincerely
apprehensive
that
he
should
do
more
*NL*
harm
than
good
.
After
much
deliberation
,
however
,
he
consented
to
make
*NL*
a
trial
;
and
ever
since
that
period
,
he
has
acted
as
a
lecturing
*NL*
agent
,
under
the
auspices
either
of
the
American
or
the
Massachusetts
*NL*
Anti-Slavery
Society
.
In
labors
he
has
been
most
abundant
;
and
his
*NL*
success
in
combating
prejudice
,
in
gaining
proselytes
,
in
agitating
the
*NL*
public
mind
,
has
far
surpassed
the
most
sanguine
expectations
that
were
*NL*
raised
at
the
commencement
of
his
brilliant
career
.
He
has
borne
himself
*NL*
with
gentleness
and
meekness
,
yet
with
true
manliness
of
character
.
As
*NL*
a
public
speaker
,
he
excels
in
pathos
,
wit
,
comparison
,
imitation
,
*NL*
strength
of
reasoning
,
and
fluency
of
language
.
There
is
in
him
that
*NL*
union
of
head
and
heart
,
which
is
indispensable
to
an
enlightenment
*NL*
of
the
heads
and
a
winning
of
the
hearts
of
others
.
May
his
strength
*NL*
continue
to
be
equal
to
his
day
!
May
he
continue
to
``
grow
in
grace
,
and
*NL*
in
the
knowledge
of
God
,
''
that
he
may
be
increasingly
serviceable
in
the
*NL*
cause
of
bleeding
humanity
,
whether
at
home
or
abroad
!
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
certainly
a
very
remarkable
fact
,
that
one
of
the
most
efficient
*NL*
advocates
of
the
slave
population
,
now
before
the
public
,
is
a
fugitive
*NL*
slave
,
in
the
person
of
_
Frederick
Douglass
_
;
and
that
the
free
colored
*NL*
population
of
the
United
States
are
as
ably
represented
by
one
of
their
*NL*
own
number
,
in
the
person
of
_
Charles
Lenox
Remond
_
,
whose
eloquent
*NL*
appeals
have
extorted
the
highest
applause
of
multitudes
on
both
sides
*NL*
of
the
Atlantic
.
Let
the
calumniators
of
the
colored
race
despise
*NL*
themselves
for
their
baseness
and
illiberality
of
spirit
,
and
henceforth
*NL*
cease
to
talk
of
the
natural
inferiority
of
those
who
require
nothing
*NL*
but
time
and
opportunity
to
attain
to
the
highest
point
of
human
*NL*
excellence
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
may
,
perhaps
,
be
fairly
questioned
,
whether
any
other
portion
of
the
*NL*
population
of
the
earth
could
have
endured
the
privations
,
sufferings
*NL*
and
horrors
of
slavery
,
without
having
become
more
degraded
in
the
scale
*NL*
of
humanity
than
the
slaves
of
African
descent
.
Nothing
has
been
left
*NL*
undone
to
cripple
their
intellects
,
darken
their
minds
,
debase
their
*NL*
moral
nature
,
obliterate
all
traces
of
their
relationship
to
mankind
;
*NL*
and
yet
how
wonderfully
they
have
sustained
the
mighty
load
of
a
most
*NL*
frightful
bondage
,
under
which
they
have
been
groaning
for
centuries
!
To
*NL*
illustrate
the
effect
of
slavery
on
the
white
man
,
--
to
show
that
he
has
*NL*
no
powers
of
endurance
,
in
such
a
condition
,
superior
to
those
of
*NL*
his
black
brother
,
--
_
Daniel
O'connell
_
,
the
distinguished
advocate
of
*NL*
universal
emancipation
,
and
the
mightiest
champion
of
prostrate
but
not
*NL*
conquered
Ireland
,
relates
the
following
anecdote
in
a
speech
delivered
*NL*
by
him
in
the
Conciliation
Hall
,
Dublin
,
before
the
Loyal
National
*NL*
Repeal
Association
,
March
31
,
1845
.
``
No
matter
,
''
said
_
Mr.
O'connell
_
,
*NL*
``
under
what
specious
term
it
may
disguise
itself
,
slavery
is
still
*NL*
hideous
.
_
It
has
a
natural
,
an
inevitable
tendency
to
brutalize
every
*NL*
noble
faculty
of
man
.
_
An
American
sailor
,
who
was
cast
away
on
the
*NL*
shore
of
Africa
,
where
he
was
kept
in
slavery
for
three
years
,
was
,
at
*NL*
the
expiration
of
that
period
,
found
to
be
imbruted
and
stultified
--
he
*NL*
had
lost
all
reasoning
power
;
and
having
forgotten
his
native
language
,
*NL*
could
only
utter
some
savage
gibberish
between
Arabic
and
English
,
which
*NL*
nobody
could
understand
,
and
which
even
he
himself
found
difficulty
*NL*
in
pronouncing
.
So
much
for
the
humanizing
influence
of
_
The
Domestic
*NL*
Institution
_
!
''
Admitting
this
to
have
been
an
extraordinary
case
of
*NL*
mental
deterioration
,
it
proves
at
least
that
the
white
slave
can
sink
*NL*
as
low
in
the
scale
of
humanity
as
the
black
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
Mr.
Douglass
_
has
very
properly
chosen
to
write
his
own
Narrative
,
in
*NL*
his
own
style
,
and
according
to
the
best
of
his
ability
,
rather
than
*NL*
to
employ
some
one
else
.
It
is
,
therefore
,
entirely
his
own
production
;
*NL*
and
,
considering
how
long
and
dark
was
the
career
he
had
to
run
as
a
*NL*
slave
,
--
how
few
have
been
his
opportunities
to
improve
his
mind
since
he
*NL*
broke
his
iron
fetters
,
--
it
is
,
in
my
judgment
,
highly
creditable
to
his
*NL*
head
and
heart
.
He
who
can
peruse
it
without
a
tearful
eye
,
a
heaving
*NL*
breast
,
an
afflicted
spirit
,
--
without
being
filled
with
an
unutterable
*NL*
abhorrence
of
slavery
and
all
its
abettors
,
and
animated
with
a
*NL*
determination
to
seek
the
immediate
overthrow
of
that
execrable
*NL*
system
,
--
without
trembling
for
the
fate
of
this
country
in
the
hands
of
*NL*
a
righteous
God
,
who
is
ever
on
the
side
of
the
oppressed
,
and
whose
arm
*NL*
is
not
shortened
that
it
can
not
save
,
--
must
have
a
flinty
heart
,
and
be
*NL*
qualified
to
act
the
part
of
a
trafficker
``
in
slaves
and
the
souls
of
*NL*
men
.
''
I
am
confident
that
it
is
essentially
true
in
all
its
statements
;
*NL*
that
nothing
has
been
set
down
in
malice
,
nothing
exaggerated
,
nothing
*NL*
drawn
from
the
imagination
;
that
it
comes
short
of
the
reality
,
rather
*NL*
than
overstates
a
single
fact
in
regard
to
_
slavery
as
it
is
_
.
The
*NL*
experience
of
_
Frederick
Douglass
_
,
as
a
slave
,
was
not
a
peculiar
one
;
*NL*
his
lot
was
not
especially
a
hard
one
;
his
case
may
be
regarded
as
a
*NL*
very
fair
specimen
of
the
treatment
of
slaves
in
Maryland
,
in
which
*NL*
State
it
is
conceded
that
they
are
better
fed
and
less
cruelly
treated
*NL*
than
in
Georgia
,
Alabama
,
or
Louisiana
.
Many
have
suffered
incomparably
*NL*
more
,
while
very
few
on
the
plantations
have
suffered
less
,
than
*NL*
himself
.
Yet
how
deplorable
was
his
situation
!
what
terrible
*NL*
chastisements
were
inflicted
upon
his
person
!
what
still
more
shocking
*NL*
outrages
were
perpetrated
upon
his
mind
!
with
all
his
noble
powers
and
*NL*
sublime
aspirations
,
how
like
a
brute
was
he
treated
,
even
by
those
*NL*
professing
to
have
the
same
mind
in
them
that
was
in
Christ
Jesus
!
to
*NL*
what
dreadful
liabilities
was
he
continually
subjected
!
how
destitute
*NL*
of
friendly
counsel
and
aid
,
even
in
his
greatest
extremities
!
how
heavy
*NL*
was
the
midnight
of
woe
which
shrouded
in
blackness
the
last
ray
of
*NL*
hope
,
and
filled
the
future
with
terror
and
gloom
!
what
longings
after
*NL*
freedom
took
possession
of
his
breast
,
and
how
his
misery
augmented
,
*NL*
in
proportion
as
he
grew
reflective
and
intelligent
,
--
thus
demonstrating
*NL*
that
a
happy
slave
is
an
extinct
man
!
how
he
thought
,
reasoned
,
felt
,
*NL*
under
the
lash
of
the
driver
,
with
the
chains
upon
his
limbs
!
what
*NL*
perils
he
encountered
in
his
endeavors
to
escape
from
his
horrible
doom
!
*NL*
and
how
signal
have
been
his
deliverance
and
preservation
in
the
midst
*NL*
of
a
nation
of
pitiless
enemies
!
*NL*
*NL*
This
Narrative
contains
many
affecting
incidents
,
many
passages
of
great
*NL*
eloquence
and
power
;
but
I
think
the
most
thrilling
one
of
them
all
*NL*
is
the
description
_
Douglass
_
gives
of
his
feelings
,
as
he
stood
*NL*
soliloquizing
respecting
his
fate
,
and
the
chances
of
his
one
day
being
*NL*
a
freeman
,
on
the
banks
of
the
Chesapeake
Bay
--
viewing
the
receding
*NL*
vessels
as
they
flew
with
their
white
wings
before
the
breeze
,
and
*NL*
apostrophizing
them
as
animated
by
the
living
spirit
of
freedom
.
Who
*NL*
can
read
that
passage
,
and
be
insensible
to
its
pathos
and
sublimity
?
*NL*
Compressed
into
it
is
a
whole
Alexandrian
library
of
thought
,
feeling
,
*NL*
and
sentiment
--
all
that
can
,
all
that
need
be
urged
,
in
the
form
of
*NL*
expostulation
,
entreaty
,
rebuke
,
against
that
crime
of
crimes
,
--
making
*NL*
man
the
property
of
his
fellow-man
!
O
,
how
accursed
is
that
system
,
*NL*
which
entombs
the
godlike
mind
of
man
,
defaces
the
divine
image
,
reduces
*NL*
those
who
by
creation
were
crowned
with
glory
and
honor
to
a
level
with
*NL*
four-footed
beasts
,
and
exalts
the
dealer
in
human
flesh
above
all
that
*NL*
is
called
God
!
Why
should
its
existence
be
prolonged
one
hour
?
Is
it
not
*NL*
evil
,
only
evil
,
and
that
continually
?
What
does
its
presence
imply
but
*NL*
the
absence
of
all
fear
of
God
,
all
regard
for
man
,
on
the
part
of
the
*NL*
people
of
the
United
States
?
Heaven
speed
its
eternal
overthrow
!
*NL*
*NL*
So
profoundly
ignorant
of
the
nature
of
slavery
are
many
persons
,
that
*NL*
they
are
stubbornly
incredulous
whenever
they
read
or
listen
to
any
*NL*
recital
of
the
cruelties
which
are
daily
inflicted
on
its
victims
.
They
*NL*
do
not
deny
that
the
slaves
are
held
as
property
;
but
that
terrible
*NL*
fact
seems
to
convey
to
their
minds
no
idea
of
injustice
,
exposure
*NL*
to
outrage
,
or
savage
barbarity
.
Tell
them
of
cruel
scourgings
,
of
*NL*
mutilations
and
brandings
,
of
scenes
of
pollution
and
blood
,
of
the
*NL*
banishment
of
all
light
and
knowledge
,
and
they
affect
to
be
greatly
*NL*
indignant
at
such
enormous
exaggerations
,
such
wholesale
misstatements
,
*NL*
such
abominable
libels
on
the
character
of
the
southern
planters
!
As
if
*NL*
all
these
direful
outrages
were
not
the
natural
results
of
slavery
!
*NL*
As
if
it
were
less
cruel
to
reduce
a
human
being
to
the
condition
of
*NL*
a
thing
,
than
to
give
him
a
severe
flagellation
,
or
to
deprive
him
of
*NL*
necessary
food
and
clothing
!
As
if
whips
,
chains
,
thumb-screws
,
paddles
,
*NL*
blood-hounds
,
overseers
,
drivers
,
patrols
,
were
not
all
indispensable
*NL*
to
keep
the
slaves
down
,
and
to
give
protection
to
their
ruthless
*NL*
oppressors
!
As
if
,
when
the
marriage
institution
is
abolished
,
*NL*
concubinage
,
adultery
,
and
incest
,
must
not
necessarily
abound
;
when
all
*NL*
the
rights
of
humanity
are
annihilated
,
any
barrier
remains
to
protect
*NL*
the
victim
from
the
fury
of
the
spoiler
;
when
absolute
power
is
assumed
*NL*
over
life
and
liberty
,
it
will
not
be
wielded
with
destructive
sway
!
*NL*
Skeptics
of
this
character
abound
in
society
.
In
some
few
instances
,
*NL*
their
incredulity
arises
from
a
want
of
reflection
;
but
,
generally
,
it
*NL*
indicates
a
hatred
of
the
light
,
a
desire
to
shield
slavery
from
the
*NL*
assaults
of
its
foes
,
a
contempt
of
the
colored
race
,
whether
bond
or
*NL*
free
.
Such
will
try
to
discredit
the
shocking
tales
of
slaveholding
*NL*
cruelty
which
are
recorded
in
this
truthful
Narrative
;
but
they
will
*NL*
labor
in
vain
.
_
Mr.
Douglass
_
has
frankly
disclosed
the
place
of
his
*NL*
birth
,
the
names
of
those
who
claimed
ownership
in
his
body
and
soul
,
*NL*
and
the
names
also
of
those
who
committed
the
crimes
which
he
has
*NL*
alleged
against
them
.
His
statements
,
therefore
,
may
easily
be
*NL*
disproved
,
if
they
are
untrue
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
course
of
his
Narrative
,
he
relates
two
instances
of
murderous
*NL*
cruelty
,
--
in
one
of
which
a
planter
deliberately
shot
a
slave
belonging
*NL*
to
a
neighboring
plantation
,
who
had
unintentionally
gotten
within
his
*NL*
lordly
domain
in
quest
of
fish
;
and
in
the
other
,
an
overseer
blew
out
*NL*
the
brains
of
a
slave
who
had
fled
to
a
stream
of
water
to
escape
*NL*
a
bloody
scourging
.
_
Mr.
Douglass
_
states
that
in
neither
of
these
*NL*
instances
was
any
thing
done
by
way
of
legal
arrest
or
judicial
*NL*
investigation
.
The
Baltimore
American
,
of
March
17
,
1845
,
relates
*NL*
a
similar
case
of
atrocity
,
perpetrated
with
similar
impunity
--
as
*NL*
follows
:
--
''
_
Shooting
a
slave
.
_
--
We
learn
,
upon
the
authority
of
a
letter
*NL*
from
Charles
county
,
Maryland
,
received
by
a
gentleman
of
this
city
,
*NL*
that
a
young
man
,
named
Matthews
,
a
nephew
of
General
Matthews
,
and
*NL*
whose
father
,
it
is
believed
,
holds
an
office
at
Washington
,
killed
one
*NL*
of
the
slaves
upon
his
father
's
farm
by
shooting
him
.
The
letter
states
*NL*
that
young
Matthews
had
been
left
in
charge
of
the
farm
;
that
he
gave
*NL*
an
order
to
the
servant
,
which
was
disobeyed
,
when
he
proceeded
to
*NL*
the
house
,
_
obtained
a
gun
,
and
,
returning
,
shot
the
servant
.
_
He
*NL*
immediately
,
the
letter
continues
,
fled
to
his
father
's
residence
,
*NL*
where
he
still
remains
unmolested
.
''
--
Let
it
never
be
forgotten
,
that
no
*NL*
slaveholder
or
overseer
can
be
convicted
of
any
outrage
perpetrated
on
*NL*
the
person
of
a
slave
,
however
diabolical
it
may
be
,
on
the
testimony
*NL*
of
colored
witnesses
,
whether
bond
or
free
.
By
the
slave
code
,
they
are
*NL*
adjudged
to
be
as
incompetent
to
testify
against
a
white
man
,
as
though
*NL*
they
were
indeed
a
part
of
the
brute
creation
.
Hence
,
there
is
no
*NL*
legal
protection
in
fact
,
whatever
there
may
be
in
form
,
for
the
slave
*NL*
population
;
and
any
amount
of
cruelty
may
be
inflicted
on
them
with
*NL*
impunity
.
Is
it
possible
for
the
human
mind
to
conceive
of
a
more
*NL*
horrible
state
of
society
?
*NL*
*NL*
The
effect
of
a
religious
profession
on
the
conduct
of
southern
masters
*NL*
is
vividly
described
in
the
following
Narrative
,
and
shown
to
be
any
*NL*
thing
but
salutary
.
In
the
nature
of
the
case
,
it
must
be
in
the
highest
*NL*
degree
pernicious
.
The
testimony
of
_
Mr.
Douglass
_
,
on
this
point
,
is
*NL*
sustained
by
a
cloud
of
witnesses
,
whose
veracity
is
unimpeachable
.
``
A
*NL*
slaveholder
's
profession
of
Christianity
is
a
palpable
imposture
.
He
*NL*
is
a
felon
of
the
highest
grade
.
He
is
a
man-stealer
.
It
is
of
no
*NL*
importance
what
you
put
in
the
other
scale
.
''
*NL*
*NL*

are
you
with
the
man-stealers
in
sympathy
and
purpose
,
or
on
the
*NL*
side
of
their
down-trodden
victims
?
If
with
the
former
,
then
are
you
the

foe
of
God
and

If
with
the

do
*NL*
and

in
their

Be
faithful
,
be
vigilant
,
be
untiring
in
your

efforts
to
break
every
yoke

LETTER
FROM

PHILLIPS

ESQ.

*NL*
*NL*
BOSTON
,
APRIL
22
,

*NL*
*NL*
My
Dear
Friend
:
*NL*
*NL*
You
remember
the
old
fable
of
``
The
Man
and
the
Lion
,
''
where
the
lion
*NL*
complained
that
he
should
not
be
so
misrepresented
``
when
the
lions
wrote
*NL*
history
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
am
glad
the
time
has
come
when
the
``
lions
write
history
.
''
We
have
been
*NL*
left
long
enough
to
gather
the
character
of
slavery
from
the
involuntary
*NL*
evidence
of
the
masters
.
One
might
,
indeed
,
rest
sufficiently
satisfied
*NL*
with
what
,
it
is
evident
,
must
be
,
in
general
,
the
results
of
such
a
*NL*
relation
,
without
seeking
farther
to
find
whether
they
have
followed
in
*NL*
every
instance
.
Indeed
,
those
who
stare
at
the
half-peck
of
corn
a
week
,
*NL*
and
love
to
count
the
lashes
on
the
slave
's
back
,
are
seldom
the
``
stuff
''
*NL*
out
of
which
reformers
and
abolitionists
are
to
be
made
.
I
remember
*NL*
that
,
in
1838
,
many
were
waiting
for
the
results
of
the
West
India
*NL*
experiment
,
before
they
could
come
into
our
ranks
.
Those
``
results
''
have
*NL*
come
long
ago
;
but
,
alas
!
few
of
that
number
have
come
with
them
,
as
*NL*
converts
.
A
man
must
be
disposed
to
judge
of
emancipation
by
other
tests
*NL*
than
whether
it
has
increased
the
produce
of
sugar
,
--
and
to
hate
slavery
*NL*
for
other
reasons
than
because
it
starves
men
and
whips
women
,
--
before
he
*NL*
is
ready
to
lay
the
first
stone
of
his
anti-slavery
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
glad
to
learn
,
in
your
story
,
how
early
the
most
neglected
of
*NL*
God
's
children
waken
to
a
sense
of
their
rights
,
and
of
the
injustice
*NL*
done
them
.
Experience
is
a
keen
teacher
;
and
long
before
you
had
*NL*
mastered
your
A
B
C
,
or
knew
where
the
``
white
sails
''
of
the
Chesapeake
*NL*
were
bound
,
you
began
,
I
see
,
to
gauge
the
wretchedness
of
the
slave
,
*NL*
not
by
his
hunger
and
want
,
not
by
his
lashes
and
toil
,
but
by
the
cruel
*NL*
and
blighting
death
which
gathers
over
his
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
connection
with
this
,
there
is
one
circumstance
which
makes
your
*NL*
recollections
peculiarly
valuable
,
and
renders
your
early
insight
the
*NL*
more
remarkable
.
You
come
from
that
part
of
the
country
where
we
are
*NL*
told
slavery
appears
with
its
fairest
features
.
Let
us
hear
,
then
,
what
*NL*
it
is
at
its
best
estate
--
gaze
on
its
bright
side
,
if
it
has
one
;
and
*NL*
then
imagination
may
task
her
powers
to
add
dark
lines
to
the
picture
,
*NL*
as
she
travels
southward
to
that
-LRB-
for
the
colored
man
-RRB-
Valley
of
the
*NL*
Shadow
of
Death
,
where
the
Mississippi
sweeps
along
.
*NL*
*NL*
Again
,
we
have
known
you
long
,
and
can
put
the
most
entire
confidence
in
*NL*
your
truth
,
candor
,
and
sincerity
.
Every
one
who
has
heard
you
speak
*NL*
has
felt
,
and
,
I
am
confident
,
every
one
who
reads
your
book
will
feel
,
*NL*
persuaded
that
you
give
them
a
fair
specimen
of
the
whole
truth
.
No
*NL*
one-sided
portrait
,
--
no
wholesale
complaints
,
--
but
strict
justice
done
,
*NL*
whenever
individual
kindliness
has
neutralized
,
for
a
moment
,
the
deadly
*NL*
system
with
which
it
was
strangely
allied
.
You
have
been
with
us
,
too
,
*NL*
some
years
,
and
can
fairly
compare
the
twilight
of
rights
,
which
your
*NL*
race
enjoy
at
the
North
,
with
that
``
noon
of
night
''
under
which
they
*NL*
labor
south
of
Mason
and
Dixon
's
line
.
Tell
us
whether
,
after
all
,
the
*NL*
half-free
colored
man
of
Massachusetts
is
worse
off
than
the
pampered
*NL*
slave
of
the
rice
swamps
!
*NL*
*NL*
In
reading
your
life
,
no
one
can
say
that
we
have
unfairly
picked
out
*NL*
some
rare
specimens
of
cruelty
.
We
know
that
the
bitter
drops
,
which
*NL*
even
you
have
drained
from
the
cup
,
are
no
incidental
aggravations
,
no
*NL*
individual
ills
,
but
such
as
must
mingle
always
and
necessarily
in
*NL*
the
lot
of
every
slave
.
They
are
the
essential
ingredients
,
not
the
*NL*
occasional
results
,
of
the
system
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
all
,
I
shall
read
your
book
with
trembling
for
you
.
Some
years
*NL*
ago
,
when
you
were
beginning
to
tell
me
your
real
name
and
birthplace
,
*NL*
you
may
remember
I
stopped
you
,
and
preferred
to
remain
ignorant
of
*NL*
all
.
With
the
exception
of
a
vague
description
,
so
I
continued
,
till
the
*NL*
other
day
,
when
you
read
me
your
memoirs
.
I
hardly
knew
,
at
the
time
,
*NL*
whether
to
thank
you
or
not
for
the
sight
of
them
,
when
I
reflected
that
*NL*
it
was
still
dangerous
,
in
Massachusetts
,
for
honest
men
to
tell
*NL*
their
names
!
They
say
the
fathers
,
in
1776
,
signed
the
Declaration
of
*NL*
Independence
with
the
halter
about
their
necks
.
You
,
too
,
publish
your
*NL*
declaration
of
freedom
with
danger
compassing
you
around
.
In
all
the
*NL*
broad
lands
which
the
Constitution
of
the
United
States
overshadows
,
*NL*
there
is
no
single
spot
,
--
however
narrow
or
desolate
,
--
where
a
fugitive
*NL*
slave
can
plant
himself
and
say
,
``
I
am
safe
.
''
The
whole
armory
of
*NL*
Northern
Law
has
no
shield
for
you
.
I
am
free
to
say
that
,
in
your
*NL*
place
,
I
should
throw
the
MS.
into
the
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
You
,
perhaps
,
may
tell
your
story
in
safety
,
endeared
as
you
are
to
so
*NL*
many
warm
hearts
by
rare
gifts
,
and
a
still
rarer
devotion
of
them
to
*NL*
the
service
of
others
.
But
it
will
be
owing
only
to
your
labors
,
and
the
*NL*
fearless
efforts
of
those
who
,
trampling
the
laws
and
Constitution
of
*NL*
the
country
under
their
feet
,
are
determined
that
they
will
``
hide
the
*NL*
outcast
,
''
and
that
their
hearths
shall
be
,
spite
of
the
law
,
an
asylum
*NL*
for
the
oppressed
,
if
,
some
time
or
other
,
the
humblest
may
stand
in
our
*NL*
streets
,
and
bear
witness
in
safety
against
the
cruelties
of
which
he
*NL*
has
been
the
victim
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
it
is
sad
to
think
,
that
these
very
throbbing
hearts
which
welcome
*NL*
your
story
,
and
form
your
best
safeguard
in
telling
it
,
are
all
beating
*NL*
contrary
to
the
``
statute
in
such
case
made
and
provided
.
''
Go
on
,
my
dear
*NL*
friend
,
till
you
,
and
those
who
,
like
you
,
have
been
saved
,
so
as
by
*NL*
fire
,
from
the
dark
prison-house
,
shall
stereotype
these
free
,
*NL*
illegal
pulses
into
statutes
;
and
New
England
,
cutting
loose
from
a
*NL*
blood-stained
Union
,
shall
glory
in
being
the
house
of
refuge
for
the
*NL*
oppressed
,
--
till
we
no
longer
merely
''
_
hide
_
the
outcast
,
''
or
make
*NL*
a
merit
of
standing
idly
by
while
he
is
hunted
in
our
midst
;
but
,
*NL*
consecrating
anew
the
soil
of
the
Pilgrims
as
an
asylum
for
the
*NL*
oppressed
,
proclaim
our
_
welcome
_
to
the
slave
so
loudly
,
that
the
tones
*NL*
shall
reach
every
hut
in
the
Carolinas
,
and
make
the
broken-hearted
*NL*
bondman
leap
up
at
the
thought
of
old
Massachusetts
.

*NL*
God
speed
the

FREDERICK
DOUGLASS
.
*NL*
*NL*
Frederick
Douglass
was
born
in
slavery
as
Frederick
Augustus
Washington
*NL*
Bailey
near
Easton
in
Talbot
County
,
Maryland
.
He
was
not
sure
of
the
*NL*
exact
year
of
his
birth
,
but
he
knew
that
it
was
1817
or
1818
.
As
a
*NL*
young
boy
he
was
sent
to
Baltimore
,
to
be
a
house
servant
,
where
he
*NL*
learned
to
read
and
write
,
with
the
assistance
of
his
master
's
wife
.
In
*NL*
1838
he
escaped
from
slavery
and
went
to
New
York
City
,
where
he
married
*NL*
Anna
Murray
,
a
free
colored
woman
whom
he
had
met
in
Baltimore
.
Soon
*NL*
thereafter
he
changed
his
name
to
Frederick
Douglass
.
In
1841
he
*NL*
addressed
a
convention
of
the
Massachusetts
Anti-Slavery
Society
in
*NL*
Nantucket
and
so
greatly
impressed
the
group
that
they
immediately
*NL*
employed
him
as
an
agent
.
He
was
such
an
impressive
orator
that
numerous
*NL*
persons
doubted
if
he
had
ever
been
a
slave
,
so
he
wrote
_
Narrative
Of
*NL*
The
Life
Of
Frederick
Douglass
_
.
During
the
Civil
War
he
assisted
in
the
*NL*
recruiting
of
colored
men
for
the
54th
and
55th
Massachusetts
Regiments
*NL*
and
consistently
argued
for
the
emancipation
of
slaves
.
After
the
war
he
*NL*
was
active
in
securing
and
protecting
the
rights
of
the
freemen
.
In
his
*NL*
later
years
,
at
different
times
,
he
was
secretary
of
the
Santo
Domingo
*NL*
Commission
,
marshall
and
recorder
of
deeds
of
the
District
of
Columbia
,
*NL*
and
United
States
Minister
to
Haiti
.
His
other
autobiographical
works

are

Bondage
And

Freedom

and
_
Life
And
Times
Of
Frederick
*NL*
Douglass

,
published
in
1855
and
1881
respectively
.
He
died
in
1895

CHAPTER
I
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
born
in
Tuckahoe
,
near
Hillsborough
,
and
about
twelve
miles
from
*NL*
Easton
,
in
Talbot
county
,
Maryland
.
I
have
no
accurate
knowledge
of
my
*NL*
age
,
never
having
seen
any
authentic
record
containing
it
.
By
far
the
*NL*
larger
part
of
the
slaves
know
as
little
of
their
ages
as
horses
know
of
*NL*
theirs
,
and
it
is
the
wish
of
most
masters
within
my
knowledge
to
keep
*NL*
their
slaves
thus
ignorant
.
I
do
not
remember
to
have
ever
met
a
slave
*NL*
who
could
tell
of
his
birthday
.
They
seldom
come
nearer
to
it
than
*NL*
planting-time
,
harvest-time
,
cherry-time
,
spring-time
,
or
fall-time
.
A
*NL*
want
of
information
concerning
my
own
was
a
source
of
unhappiness
to
me
*NL*
even
during
childhood
.
The
white
children
could
tell
their
ages
.
I
could
*NL*
not
tell
why
I
ought
to
be
deprived
of
the
same
privilege
.
I
was
not
*NL*
allowed
to
make
any
inquiries
of
my
master
concerning
it
.
He
deemed
*NL*
all
such
inquiries
on
the
part
of
a
slave
improper
and
impertinent
,
and
*NL*
evidence
of
a
restless
spirit
.
The
nearest
estimate
I
can
give
makes
me
*NL*
now
between
twenty-seven
and
twenty-eight
years
of
age
.
I
come
to
this
,
*NL*
from
hearing
my
master
say
,
some
time
during
1835
,
I
was
about
seventeen
*NL*
years
old
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
mother
was
named
Harriet
Bailey
.
She
was
the
daughter
of
Isaac
and
*NL*
Betsey
Bailey
,
both
colored
,
and
quite
dark
.
My
mother
was
of
a
darker
*NL*
complexion
than
either
my
grandmother
or
grandfather
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
father
was
a
white
man
.
He
was
admitted
to
be
such
by
all
I
ever
*NL*
heard
speak
of
my
parentage
.
The
opinion
was
also
whispered
that
my
*NL*
master
was
my
father
;
but
of
the
correctness
of
this
opinion
,
I
know
*NL*
nothing
;
the
means
of
knowing
was
withheld
from
me
.
My
mother
and
I
were
*NL*
separated
when
I
was
but
an
infant
--
before
I
knew
her
as
my
mother
.
It
is
*NL*
a
common
custom
,
in
the
part
of
Maryland
from
which
I
ran
away
,
to
part
*NL*
children
from
their
mothers
at
a
very
early
age
.
Frequently
,
before
the
*NL*
child
has
reached
its
twelfth
month
,
its
mother
is
taken
from
it
,
and
*NL*
hired
out
on
some
farm
a
considerable
distance
off
,
and
the
child
is
*NL*
placed
under
the
care
of
an
old
woman
,
too
old
for
field
labor
.
For
*NL*
what
this
separation
is
done
,
I
do
not
know
,
unless
it
be
to
hinder
the
*NL*
development
of
the
child
's
affection
toward
its
mother
,
and
to
blunt
and
*NL*
destroy
the
natural
affection
of
the
mother
for
the
child
.
This
is
the
*NL*
inevitable
result
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
never
saw
my
mother
,
to
know
her
as
such
,
more
than
four
or
five
times
*NL*
in
my
life
;
and
each
of
these
times
was
very
short
in
duration
,
and
at
*NL*
night
.
She
was
hired
by
a
Mr.
Stewart
,
who
lived
about
twelve
miles
from
*NL*
my
home
.
She
made
her
journeys
to
see
me
in
the
night
,
travelling
the
*NL*
whole
distance
on
foot
,
after
the
performance
of
her
day
's
work
.
She
was
*NL*
a
field
hand
,
and
a
whipping
is
the
penalty
of
not
being
in
the
field
at
*NL*
sunrise
,
unless
a
slave
has
special
permission
from
his
or
her
master
to
*NL*
the
contrary
--
a
permission
which
they
seldom
get
,
and
one
that
gives
*NL*
to
him
that
gives
it
the
proud
name
of
being
a
kind
master
.
I
do
not
*NL*
recollect
of
ever
seeing
my
mother
by
the
light
of
day
.
She
was
with
me
*NL*
in
the
night
.
She
would
lie
down
with
me
,
and
get
me
to
sleep
,
but
long
*NL*
before
I
waked
she
was
gone
.
Very
little
communication
ever
took
place
*NL*
between
us
.
Death
soon
ended
what
little
we
could
have
while
she
lived
,
*NL*
and
with
it
her
hardships
and
suffering
.
She
died
when
I
was
about
*NL*
seven
years
old
,
on
one
of
my
master
's
farms
,
near
Lee
's
Mill
.
I
was
not
*NL*
allowed
to
be
present
during
her
illness
,
at
her
death
,
or
burial
.
She
*NL*
was
gone
long
before
I
knew
any
thing
about
it
.
Never
having
enjoyed
,
to
*NL*
any
considerable
extent
,
her
soothing
presence
,
her
tender
and
watchful
*NL*
care
,
I
received
the
tidings
of
her
death
with
much
the
same
emotions
I
*NL*
should
have
probably
felt
at
the
death
of
a
stranger
.
*NL*
*NL*
Called
thus
suddenly
away
,
she
left
me
without
the
slightest
intimation
*NL*
of
who
my
father
was
.
The
whisper
that
my
master
was
my
father
,
may
or
*NL*
may
not
be
true
;
and
,
true
or
false
,
it
is
of
but
little
consequence
to
*NL*
my
purpose
whilst
the
fact
remains
,
in
all
its
glaring
odiousness
,
that
*NL*
slaveholders
have
ordained
,
and
by
law
established
,
that
the
children
*NL*
of
slave
women
shall
in
all
cases
follow
the
condition
of
their
mothers
;
*NL*
and
this
is
done
too
obviously
to
administer
to
their
own
lusts
,
and
*NL*
make
a
gratification
of
their
wicked
desires
profitable
as
well
as
*NL*
pleasurable
;
for
by
this
cunning
arrangement
,
the
slaveholder
,
in
cases
*NL*
not
a
few
,
sustains
to
his
slaves
the
double
relation
of
master
and
*NL*
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
know
of
such
cases
;
and
it
is
worthy
of
remark
that
such
slaves
*NL*
invariably
suffer
greater
hardships
,
and
have
more
to
contend
with
,
*NL*
than
others
.
They
are
,
in
the
first
place
,
a
constant
offence
to
their
*NL*
mistress
.
She
is
ever
disposed
to
find
fault
with
them
;
they
can
seldom
*NL*
do
any
thing
to
please
her
;
she
is
never
better
pleased
than
when
she
*NL*
sees
them
under
the
lash
,
especially
when
she
suspects
her
husband
of
*NL*
showing
to
his
mulatto
children
favors
which
he
withholds
from
his
black
*NL*
slaves
.
The
master
is
frequently
compelled
to
sell
this
class
of
his
*NL*
slaves
,
out
of
deference
to
the
feelings
of
his
white
wife
;
and
,
cruel
*NL*
as
the
deed
may
strike
any
one
to
be
,
for
a
man
to
sell
his
own
children
*NL*
to
human
flesh-mongers
,
it
is
often
the
dictate
of
humanity
for
him
to
*NL*
do
so
;
for
,
unless
he
does
this
,
he
must
not
only
whip
them
himself
,
*NL*
but
must
stand
by
and
see
one
white
son
tie
up
his
brother
,
of
but
few
*NL*
shades
darker
complexion
than
himself
,
and
ply
the
gory
lash
to
his
*NL*
naked
back
;
and
if
he
lisp
one
word
of
disapproval
,
it
is
set
down
to
*NL*
his
parental
partiality
,
and
only
makes
a
bad
matter
worse
,
both
for
*NL*
himself
and
the
slave
whom
he
would
protect
and
defend
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
year
brings
with
it
multitudes
of
this
class
of
slaves
.
It
was
*NL*
doubtless
in
consequence
of
a
knowledge
of
this
fact
,
that
one
great
*NL*
statesman
of
the
south
predicted
the
downfall
of
slavery
by
the
*NL*
inevitable
laws
of
population
.
Whether
this
prophecy
is
ever
fulfilled
*NL*
or
not
,
it
is
nevertheless
plain
that
a
very
different-looking
class
of
*NL*
people
are
springing
up
at
the
south
,
and
are
now
held
in
slavery
,
*NL*
from
those
originally
brought
to
this
country
from
Africa
;
and
if
their
*NL*
increase
do
no
other
good
,
it
will
do
away
the
force
of
the
argument
,
*NL*
that
God
cursed
Ham
,
and
therefore
American
slavery
is
right
.
If
the
*NL*
lineal
descendants
of
Ham
are
alone
to
be
scripturally
enslaved
,
it
is
*NL*
certain
that
slavery
at
the
south
must
soon
become
unscriptural
;
for
*NL*
thousands
are
ushered
into
the
world
,
annually
,
who
,
like
myself
,
owe
*NL*
their
existence
to
white
fathers
,
and
those
fathers
most
frequently
*NL*
their
own
masters
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
had
two
masters
.
My
first
master
's
name
was
Anthony
.
I
do
not
*NL*
remember
his
first
name
.
He
was
generally
called
Captain
Anthony
--
a
title
*NL*
which
,
I
presume
,
he
acquired
by
sailing
a
craft
on
the
Chesapeake
Bay
.
*NL*
He
was
not
considered
a
rich
slaveholder
.
He
owned
two
or
three
farms
,
*NL*
and
about
thirty
slaves
.
His
farms
and
slaves
were
under
the
care
of
an
*NL*
overseer
.
The
overseer
's
name
was
Plummer
.
Mr.
Plummer
was
a
miserable
*NL*
drunkard
,
a
profane
swearer
,
and
a
savage
monster
.
He
always
went
armed
*NL*
with
a
cowskin
and
a
heavy
cudgel
.
I
have
known
him
to
cut
and
slash
*NL*
the
women
's
heads
so
horribly
,
that
even
master
would
be
enraged
at
*NL*
his
cruelty
,
and
would
threaten
to
whip
him
if
he
did
not
mind
himself
.
*NL*
Master
,
however
,
was
not
a
humane
slaveholder
.
It
required
extraordinary
*NL*
barbarity
on
the
part
of
an
overseer
to
affect
him
.
He
was
a
cruel
man
,
*NL*
hardened
by
a
long
life
of
slaveholding
.
He
would
at
times
seem
to
take
*NL*
great
pleasure
in
whipping
a
slave
.
I
have
often
been
awakened
at
the
*NL*
dawn
of
day
by
the
most
heart-rending
shrieks
of
an
own
aunt
of
mine
,
*NL*
whom
he
used
to
tie
up
to
a
joist
,
and
whip
upon
her
naked
back
till
she
*NL*
was
literally
covered
with
blood
.
No
words
,
no
tears
,
no
prayers
,
from
*NL*
his
gory
victim
,
seemed
to
move
his
iron
heart
from
its
bloody
purpose
.
*NL*
The
louder
she
screamed
,
the
harder
he
whipped
;
and
where
the
blood
ran
*NL*
fastest
,
there
he
whipped
longest
.
He
would
whip
her
to
make
her
scream
,
*NL*
and
whip
her
to
make
her
hush
;
and
not
until
overcome
by
fatigue
,
would
*NL*
he
cease
to
swing
the
blood-clotted
cowskin
.
I
remember
the
first
time
I
*NL*
ever
witnessed
this
horrible
exhibition
.
I
was
quite
a
child
,
but
I
well
*NL*
remember
it
.
I
never
shall
forget
it
whilst
I
remember
any
thing
.
It
was
*NL*
the
first
of
a
long
series
of
such
outrages
,
of
which
I
was
doomed
to
be
*NL*
a
witness
and
a
participant
.
It
struck
me
with
awful
force
.
It
was
the
*NL*
blood-stained
gate
,
the
entrance
to
the
hell
of
slavery
,
through
which
*NL*
I
was
about
to
pass
.
It
was
a
most
terrible
spectacle
.
I
wish
I
could
*NL*
commit
to
paper
the
feelings
with
which
I
beheld
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
occurrence
took
place
very
soon
after
I
went
to
live
with
my
old
*NL*
master
,
and
under
the
following
circumstances
.
Aunt
Hester
went
out
one
*NL*
night
,
--
where
or
for
what
I
do
not
know
,
--
and
happened
to
be
absent
*NL*
when
my
master
desired
her
presence
.
He
had
ordered
her
not
to
go
*NL*
out
evenings
,
and
warned
her
that
she
must
never
let
him
catch
her
in
*NL*
company
with
a
young
man
,
who
was
paying
attention
to
her
belonging
to
*NL*
Colonel
Lloyd
.
The
young
man
's
name
was
Ned
Roberts
,
generally
called
*NL*
Lloyd
's
Ned
.
Why
master
was
so
careful
of
her
,
may
be
safely
left
to
*NL*
conjecture
.
She
was
a
woman
of
noble
form
,
and
of
graceful
proportions
,
*NL*
having
very
few
equals
,
and
fewer
superiors
,
in
personal
appearance
,
*NL*
among
the
colored
or
white
women
of
our
neighborhood
.
*NL*
*NL*
Aunt
Hester
had
not
only
disobeyed
his
orders
in
going
out
,
but
had
been
*NL*
found
in
company
with
Lloyd
's
Ned
;
which
circumstance
,
I
found
,
from
*NL*
what
he
said
while
whipping
her
,
was
the
chief
offence
.
Had
he
been
a
*NL*
man
of
pure
morals
himself
,
he
might
have
been
thought
interested
in
*NL*
protecting
the
innocence
of
my
aunt
;
but
those
who
knew
him
will
not
*NL*
suspect
him
of
any
such
virtue
.
Before
he
commenced
whipping
Aunt
*NL*
Hester
,
he
took
her
into
the
kitchen
,
and
stripped
her
from
neck
to
*NL*
waist
,
leaving
her
neck
,
shoulders
,
and
back
,
entirely
naked
.
He
then
*NL*
told
her
to
cross
her
hands
,
calling
her
at
the
same
time
a
d
--
d
b
--
h
.
*NL*
After
crossing
her
hands
,
he
tied
them
with
a
strong
rope
,
and
led
her
*NL*
to
a
stool
under
a
large
hook
in
the
joist
,
put
in
for
the
purpose
.
He
*NL*
made
her
get
upon
the
stool
,
and
tied
her
hands
to
the
hook
.
She
now
*NL*
stood
fair
for
his
infernal
purpose
.
Her
arms
were
stretched
up
at
their
*NL*
full
length
,
so
that
she
stood
upon
the
ends
of
her
toes
.
He
then
said
*NL*
to
her
,
``
Now
,
you
d
--
d
b
--
h
,
I
'll
learn
you
how
to
disobey
my
orders
!
''
*NL*
and
after
rolling
up
his
sleeves
,
he
commenced
to
lay
on
the
heavy
*NL*
cowskin
,
and
soon
the
warm
,
red
blood
-LRB-
amid
heart-rending
shrieks
from
*NL*
her
,
and
horrid
oaths
from
him
-RRB-
came
dripping
to
the
floor
.
I
was
so
*NL*
terrified
and
horror-stricken
at
the
sight
,
that
I
hid
myself
in
a
*NL*
closet
,
and
dared
not
venture
out
till
long
after
the
bloody
transaction
*NL*
was
over
.
I
expected
it
would
be
my
turn
next
.
It
was
all
new
to
me
.
*NL*
I
had
never
seen
any
thing
like
it
before
.
I
had
always
lived
with
my
*NL*
grandmother
on
the
outskirts
of
the
plantation
,
where
she
was
put
to
*NL*
raise
the
children
of
the
younger
women
.
I
had
therefore
been
,
until
*NL*
now
,
out
of
the
way
of
the
bloody
scenes
that
often
occurred
on
the
*NL*
plantation
.

CHAPTER
II
*NL*
*NL*
My
master
's
family
consisted
of
two
sons
,
Andrew
and
Richard
;
one
*NL*
daughter
,
Lucretia
,
and
her
husband
,
Captain
Thomas
Auld
.
They
lived
in
*NL*
one
house
,
upon
the
home
plantation
of
Colonel
Edward
Lloyd
.
My
master
*NL*
was
Colonel
Lloyd
's
clerk
and
superintendent
.
He
was
what
might
be
*NL*
called
the
overseer
of
the
overseers
.
I
spent
two
years
of
childhood
on
*NL*
this
plantation
in
my
old
master
's
family
.
It
was
here
that
I
witnessed
*NL*
the
bloody
transaction
recorded
in
the
first
chapter
;
and
as
I
received
*NL*
my
first
impressions
of
slavery
on
this
plantation
,
I
will
give
some
*NL*
description
of
it
,
and
of
slavery
as
it
there
existed
.
The
plantation
is
*NL*
about
twelve
miles
north
of
Easton
,
in
Talbot
county
,
and
is
situated
*NL*
on
the
border
of
Miles
River
.
The
principal
products
raised
upon
it
were
*NL*
tobacco
,
corn
,
and
wheat
.
These
were
raised
in
great
abundance
;
so
that
,
*NL*
with
the
products
of
this
and
the
other
farms
belonging
to
him
,
he
was
*NL*
able
to
keep
in
almost
constant
employment
a
large
sloop
,
in
carrying
*NL*
them
to
market
at
Baltimore
.
This
sloop
was
named
Sally
Lloyd
,
in
honor
*NL*
of
one
of
the
colonel
's
daughters
.
My
master
's
son-in-law
,
Captain
Auld
,
*NL*
was
master
of
the
vessel
;
she
was
otherwise
manned
by
the
colonel
's
*NL*
own
slaves
.
Their
names
were
Peter
,
Isaac
,
Rich
,
and
Jake
.
These
*NL*
were
esteemed
very
highly
by
the
other
slaves
,
and
looked
upon
as
the
*NL*
privileged
ones
of
the
plantation
;
for
it
was
no
small
affair
,
in
the
*NL*
eyes
of
the
slaves
,
to
be
allowed
to
see
Baltimore
.
*NL*
*NL*
Colonel
Lloyd
kept
from
three
to
four
hundred
slaves
on
his
home
*NL*
plantation
,
and
owned
a
large
number
more
on
the
neighboring
farms
*NL*
belonging
to
him
.
The
names
of
the
farms
nearest
to
the
home
plantation
*NL*
were
Wye
Town
and
New
Design
.
``
Wye
Town
''
was
under
the
overseership
of
*NL*
a
man
named
Noah
Willis
.
New
Design
was
under
the
overseership
of
a
*NL*
Mr.
Townsend
.
The
overseers
of
these
,
and
all
the
rest
of
the
farms
,
*NL*
numbering
over
twenty
,
received
advice
and
direction
from
the
managers
*NL*
of
the
home
plantation
.
This
was
the
great
business
place
.
It
was
the
*NL*
seat
of
government
for
the
whole
twenty
farms
.
All
disputes
among
*NL*
the
overseers
were
settled
here
.
If
a
slave
was
convicted
of
any
high
*NL*
misdemeanor
,
became
unmanageable
,
or
evinced
a
determination
to
run
*NL*
away
,
he
was
brought
immediately
here
,
severely
whipped
,
put
on
board
*NL*
the
sloop
,
carried
to
Baltimore
,
and
sold
to
Austin
Woolfolk
,
or
some
*NL*
other
slave-trader
,
as
a
warning
to
the
slaves
remaining
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
,
too
,
the
slaves
of
all
the
other
farms
received
their
monthly
*NL*
allowance
of
food
,
and
their
yearly
clothing
.
The
men
and
women
slaves
*NL*
received
,
as
their
monthly
allowance
of
food
,
eight
pounds
of
pork
,
*NL*
or
its
equivalent
in
fish
,
and
one
bushel
of
corn
meal
.
Their
yearly
*NL*
clothing
consisted
of
two
coarse
linen
shirts
,
one
pair
of
linen
*NL*
trousers
,
like
the
shirts
,
one
jacket
,
one
pair
of
trousers
for
winter
,
*NL*
made
of
coarse
negro
cloth
,
one
pair
of
stockings
,
and
one
pair
of
*NL*
shoes
;
the
whole
of
which
could
not
have
cost
more
than
seven
dollars
.
*NL*
The
allowance
of
the
slave
children
was
given
to
their
mothers
,
or
the
*NL*
old
women
having
the
care
of
them
.
The
children
unable
to
work
in
the
*NL*
field
had
neither
shoes
,
stockings
,
jackets
,
nor
trousers
,
given
to
*NL*
them
;
their
clothing
consisted
of
two
coarse
linen
shirts
per
year
.
*NL*
When
these
failed
them
,
they
went
naked
until
the
next
allowance-day
.
*NL*
Children
from
seven
to
ten
years
old
,
of
both
sexes
,
almost
naked
,
might
*NL*
be
seen
at
all
seasons
of
the
year
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
no
beds
given
the
slaves
,
unless
one
coarse
blanket
be
*NL*
considered
such
,
and
none
but
the
men
and
women
had
these
.
This
,
*NL*
however
,
is
not
considered
a
very
great
privation
.
They
find
less
*NL*
difficulty
from
the
want
of
beds
,
than
from
the
want
of
time
to
sleep
;
*NL*
for
when
their
day
's
work
in
the
field
is
done
,
the
most
of
them
having
*NL*
their
washing
,
mending
,
and
cooking
to
do
,
and
having
few
or
none
of
*NL*
the
ordinary
facilities
for
doing
either
of
these
,
very
many
of
their
*NL*
sleeping
hours
are
consumed
in
preparing
for
the
field
the
coming
day
;
*NL*
and
when
this
is
done
,
old
and
young
,
male
and
female
,
married
and
*NL*
single
,
drop
down
side
by
side
,
on
one
common
bed
,
--
the
cold
,
damp
*NL*
floor
,
--
each
covering
himself
or
herself
with
their
miserable
blankets
;
*NL*
and
here
they
sleep
till
they
are
summoned
to
the
field
by
the
driver
's
*NL*
horn
.
At
the
sound
of
this
,
all
must
rise
,
and
be
off
to
the
field
.
*NL*
There
must
be
no
halting
;
every
one
must
be
at
his
or
her
post
;
and
woe
*NL*
betides
them
who
hear
not
this
morning
summons
to
the
field
;
for
if
*NL*
they
are
not
awakened
by
the
sense
of
hearing
,
they
are
by
the
sense
of
*NL*
feeling
:
no
age
nor
sex
finds
any
favor
.
Mr.
Severe
,
the
overseer
,
used
*NL*
to
stand
by
the
door
of
the
quarter
,
armed
with
a
large
hickory
stick
*NL*
and
heavy
cowskin
,
ready
to
whip
any
one
who
was
so
unfortunate
as
not
*NL*
to
hear
,
or
,
from
any
other
cause
,
was
prevented
from
being
ready
to
*NL*
start
for
the
field
at
the
sound
of
the
horn
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Severe
was
rightly
named
:
he
was
a
cruel
man
.
I
have
seen
him
whip
a
*NL*
woman
,
causing
the
blood
to
run
half
an
hour
at
the
time
;
and
this
,
*NL*
too
,
in
the
midst
of
her
crying
children
,
pleading
for
their
mother
's
*NL*
release
.
He
seemed
to
take
pleasure
in
manifesting
his
fiendish
*NL*
barbarity
.
Added
to
his
cruelty
,
he
was
a
profane
swearer
.
It
was
enough
*NL*
to
chill
the
blood
and
stiffen
the
hair
of
an
ordinary
man
to
hear
him
*NL*
talk
.
Scarce
a
sentence
escaped
him
but
that
was
commenced
or
concluded
*NL*
by
some
horrid
oath
.
The
field
was
the
place
to
witness
his
cruelty
*NL*
and
profanity
.
His
presence
made
it
both
the
field
of
blood
and
of
*NL*
blasphemy
.
From
the
rising
till
the
going
down
of
the
sun
,
he
was
*NL*
cursing
,
raving
,
cutting
,
and
slashing
among
the
slaves
of
the
field
,
in
*NL*
the
most
frightful
manner
.
His
career
was
short
.
He
died
very
soon
after
*NL*
I
went
to
Colonel
Lloyd
's
;
and
he
died
as
he
lived
,
uttering
,
with
his
*NL*
dying
groans
,
bitter
curses
and
horrid
oaths
.
His
death
was
regarded
by
*NL*
the
slaves
as
the
result
of
a
merciful
providence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Severe
's
place
was
filled
by
a
Mr.
Hopkins
.
He
was
a
very
different
*NL*
man
.
He
was
less
cruel
,
less
profane
,
and
made
less
noise
,
than
Mr.
*NL*
Severe
.
His
course
was
characterized
by
no
extraordinary
demonstrations
*NL*
of
cruelty
.
He
whipped
,
but
seemed
to
take
no
pleasure
in
it
.
He
was
*NL*
called
by
the
slaves
a
good
overseer
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
home
plantation
of
Colonel
Lloyd
wore
the
appearance
of
a
country
*NL*
village
.
All
the
mechanical
operations
for
all
the
farms
were
performed
*NL*
here
.
The
shoemaking
and
mending
,
the
blacksmithing
,
cartwrighting
,
*NL*
coopering
,
weaving
,
and
grain-grinding
,
were
all
performed
by
the
slaves
*NL*
on
the
home
plantation
.
The
whole
place
wore
a
business-like
aspect
very
*NL*
unlike
the
neighboring
farms
.
The
number
of
houses
,
too
,
conspired
*NL*
to
give
it
advantage
over
the
neighboring
farms
.
It
was
called
by
the
*NL*
slaves
the
_
Great
House
Farm
.
_
Few
privileges
were
esteemed
higher
,
by
*NL*
the
slaves
of
the
out-farms
,
than
that
of
being
selected
to
do
*NL*
errands
at
the
Great
House
Farm
.
It
was
associated
in
their
minds
with
*NL*
greatness
.
A
representative
could
not
be
prouder
of
his
election
to
*NL*
a
seat
in
the
American
Congress
,
than
a
slave
on
one
of
the
out-farms
*NL*
would
be
of
his
election
to
do
errands
at
the
Great
House
Farm
.
They
*NL*
regarded
it
as
evidence
of
great
confidence
reposed
in
them
by
their
*NL*
overseers
;
and
it
was
on
this
account
,
as
well
as
a
constant
desire
to
*NL*
be
out
of
the
field
from
under
the
driver
's
lash
,
that
they
esteemed
*NL*
it
a
high
privilege
,
one
worth
careful
living
for
.
He
was
called
the
*NL*
smartest
and
most
trusty
fellow
,
who
had
this
honor
conferred
upon
*NL*
him
the
most
frequently
.
The
competitors
for
this
office
sought
as
*NL*
diligently
to
please
their
overseers
,
as
the
office-seekers
in
the
*NL*
political
parties
seek
to
please
and
deceive
the
people
.
The
same
traits
*NL*
of
character
might
be
seen
in
Colonel
Lloyd
's
slaves
,
as
are
seen
in
the
*NL*
slaves
of
the
political
parties
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
slaves
selected
to
go
to
the
Great
House
Farm
,
for
the
monthly
*NL*
allowance
for
themselves
and
their
fellow-slaves
,
were
peculiarly
*NL*
enthusiastic
.
While
on
their
way
,
they
would
make
the
dense
old
woods
,
*NL*
for
miles
around
,
reverberate
with
their
wild
songs
,
revealing
at
once
*NL*
the
highest
joy
and
the
deepest
sadness
.
They
would
compose
and
sing
as
*NL*
they
went
along
,
consulting
neither
time
nor
tune
.
The
thought
that
came
*NL*
up
,
came
out
--
if
not
in
the
word
,
in
the
sound
;
--
and
as
frequently
in
*NL*
the
one
as
in
the
other
.
They
would
sometimes
sing
the
most
pathetic
*NL*
sentiment
in
the
most
rapturous
tone
,
and
the
most
rapturous
sentiment
*NL*
in
the
most
pathetic
tone
.
Into
all
of
their
songs
they
would
manage
to
*NL*
weave
something
of
the
Great
House
Farm
.
Especially
would
they
do
this
,
*NL*
when
leaving
home
.
They
would
then
sing
most
exultingly
the
following
*NL*
words
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
going
away
to
the
Great
House
Farm
!
*NL*
O
,
yea
!
O
,
yea
!
O
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
they
would
sing
,
as
a
chorus
,
to
words
which
to
many
would
seem
*NL*
unmeaning
jargon
,
but
which
,
nevertheless
,
were
full
of
meaning
to
*NL*
themselves
.
I
have
sometimes
thought
that
the
mere
hearing
of
those
*NL*
songs
would
do
more
to
impress
some
minds
with
the
horrible
character
of
*NL*
slavery
,
than
the
reading
of
whole
volumes
of
philosophy
on
the
subject
*NL*
could
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
did
not
,
when
a
slave
,
understand
the
deep
meaning
of
those
rude
and
*NL*
apparently
incoherent
songs
.
I
was
myself
within
the
circle
;
so
that
I
*NL*
neither
saw
nor
heard
as
those
without
might
see
and
hear
.
They
told
a
*NL*
tale
of
woe
which
was
then
altogether
beyond
my
feeble
comprehension
;
*NL*
they
were
tones
loud
,
long
,
and
deep
;
they
breathed
the
prayer
and
*NL*
complaint
of
souls
boiling
over
with
the
bitterest
anguish
.
Every
tone
*NL*
was
a
testimony
against
slavery
,
and
a
prayer
to
God
for
deliverance
*NL*
from
chains
.
The
hearing
of
those
wild
notes
always
depressed
my
spirit
,
*NL*
and
filled
me
with
ineffable
sadness
.
I
have
frequently
found
myself
in
*NL*
tears
while
hearing
them
.
The
mere
recurrence
to
those
songs
,
even
*NL*
now
,
afflicts
me
;
and
while
I
am
writing
these
lines
,
an
expression
of
*NL*
feeling
has
already
found
its
way
down
my
cheek
.
To
those
songs
I
trace
*NL*
my
first
glimmering
conception
of
the
dehumanizing
character
of
slavery
.
*NL*
I
can
never
get
rid
of
that
conception
.
Those
songs
still
follow
me
,
to
*NL*
deepen
my
hatred
of
slavery
,
and
quicken
my
sympathies
for
my
brethren
*NL*
in
bonds
.
If
any
one
wishes
to
be
impressed
with
the
soul-killing
*NL*
effects
of
slavery
,
let
him
go
to
Colonel
Lloyd
's
plantation
,
and
,
on
*NL*
allowance-day
,
place
himself
in
the
deep
pine
woods
,
and
there
let
him
,
*NL*
in
silence
,
analyze
the
sounds
that
shall
pass
through
the
chambers
*NL*
of
his
soul
,
--
and
if
he
is
not
thus
impressed
,
it
will
only
be
because
*NL*
``
there
is
no
flesh
in
his
obdurate
heart
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
often
been
utterly
astonished
,
since
I
came
to
the
north
,
to
find
*NL*
persons
who
could
speak
of
the
singing
,
among
slaves
,
as
evidence
of
*NL*
their
contentment
and
happiness
.
It
is
impossible
to
conceive
of
a
*NL*
greater
mistake
.
Slaves
sing
most
when
they
are
most
unhappy
.
The
songs
*NL*
of
the
slave
represent
the
sorrows
of
his
heart
;
and
he
is
relieved
by
*NL*
them
,
only
as
an
aching
heart
is
relieved
by
its
tears
.
At
least
,
such
*NL*
is
my
experience
.
I
have
often
sung
to
drown
my
sorrow
,
but
seldom
to
*NL*
express
my
happiness
.
Crying
for
joy
,
and
singing
for
joy
,
were
alike
*NL*
uncommon
to
me
while
in
the
jaws
of
slavery
.
The
singing
of
a
man
cast
*NL*
away
upon
a
desolate
island
might
be
as
appropriately
considered
as
*NL*
evidence
of
contentment
and
happiness
,
as
the
singing
of
a
slave
;
the
*NL*
songs
of
the
one
and
of
the
other
are
prompted
by
the
same
emotion
.

CHAPTER
III
*NL*
*NL*
Colonel
Lloyd
kept
a
large
and
finely
cultivated
garden
,
which
afforded
*NL*
almost
constant
employment
for
four
men
,
besides
the
chief
gardener
,
*NL*
-LRB-
Mr.
M'Durmond
.
-RRB-
This
garden
was
probably
the
greatest
attraction
of
*NL*
the
place
.
During
the
summer
months
,
people
came
from
far
and
near
--
from
*NL*
Baltimore
,
Easton
,
and
Annapolis
--
to
see
it
.
It
abounded
in
fruits
of
*NL*
almost
every
description
,
from
the
hardy
apple
of
the
north
to
the
*NL*
delicate
orange
of
the
south
.
This
garden
was
not
the
least
source
of
*NL*
trouble
on
the
plantation
.
Its
excellent
fruit
was
quite
a
temptation
to
*NL*
the
hungry
swarms
of
boys
,
as
well
as
the
older
slaves
,
belonging
to
the
*NL*
colonel
,
few
of
whom
had
the
virtue
or
the
vice
to
resist
it
.
Scarcely
a
*NL*
day
passed
,
during
the
summer
,
but
that
some
slave
had
to
take
the
lash
*NL*
for
stealing
fruit
.
The
colonel
had
to
resort
to
all
kinds
of
stratagems
*NL*
to
keep
his
slaves
out
of
the
garden
.
The
last
and
most
successful
one
*NL*
was
that
of
tarring
his
fence
all
around
;
after
which
,
if
a
slave
was
*NL*
caught
with
any
tar
upon
his
person
,
it
was
deemed
sufficient
proof
that
*NL*
he
had
either
been
into
the
garden
,
or
had
tried
to
get
in
.
In
either
*NL*
case
,
he
was
severely
whipped
by
the
chief
gardener
.
This
plan
worked
*NL*
well
;
the
slaves
became
as
fearful
of
tar
as
of
the
lash
.
They
seemed
to
*NL*
realize
the
impossibility
of
touching
_
tar
_
without
being
defiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
colonel
also
kept
a
splendid
riding
equipage
.
His
stable
and
*NL*
carriage-house
presented
the
appearance
of
some
of
our
large
city
livery
*NL*
establishments
.
His
horses
were
of
the
finest
form
and
noblest
blood
.
*NL*
His
carriage-house
contained
three
splendid
coaches
,
three
or
four
gigs
,
*NL*
besides
dearborns
and
barouches
of
the
most
fashionable
style
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
establishment
was
under
the
care
of
two
slaves
--
old
Barney
and
young
*NL*
Barney
--
father
and
son
.
To
attend
to
this
establishment
was
their
sole
*NL*
work
.
But
it
was
by
no
means
an
easy
employment
;
for
in
nothing
was
*NL*
Colonel
Lloyd
more
particular
than
in
the
management
of
his
horses
.
The
*NL*
slightest
inattention
to
these
was
unpardonable
,
and
was
visited
upon
*NL*
those
,
under
whose
care
they
were
placed
,
with
the
severest
punishment
;
*NL*
no
excuse
could
shield
them
,
if
the
colonel
only
suspected
any
want
of
*NL*
attention
to
his
horses
--
a
supposition
which
he
frequently
indulged
,
and
*NL*
one
which
,
of
course
,
made
the
office
of
old
and
young
Barney
a
very
*NL*
trying
one
.
They
never
knew
when
they
were
safe
from
punishment
.
They
*NL*
were
frequently
whipped
when
least
deserving
,
and
escaped
whipping
when
*NL*
most
deserving
it
.
Every
thing
depended
upon
the
looks
of
the
horses
,
*NL*
and
the
state
of
Colonel
Lloyd
's
own
mind
when
his
horses
were
brought
*NL*
to
him
for
use
.
If
a
horse
did
not
move
fast
enough
,
or
hold
his
head
*NL*
high
enough
,
it
was
owing
to
some
fault
of
his
keepers
.
It
was
painful
*NL*
to
stand
near
the
stable-door
,
and
hear
the
various
complaints
against
*NL*
the
keepers
when
a
horse
was
taken
out
for
use
.
``
This
horse
has
not
had
*NL*
proper
attention
.
He
has
not
been
sufficiently
rubbed
and
curried
,
or
*NL*
he
has
not
been
properly
fed
;
his
food
was
too
wet
or
too
dry
;
he
got
it
*NL*
too
soon
or
too
late
;
he
was
too
hot
or
too
cold
;
he
had
too
much
hay
,
*NL*
and
not
enough
of
grain
;
or
he
had
too
much
grain
,
and
not
enough
*NL*
of
hay
;
instead
of
old
Barney
's
attending
to
the
horse
,
he
had
very
*NL*
improperly
left
it
to
his
son
.
''
To
all
these
complaints
,
no
matter
how
*NL*
unjust
,
the
slave
must
answer
never
a
word
.
Colonel
Lloyd
could
not
*NL*
brook
any
contradiction
from
a
slave
.
When
he
spoke
,
a
slave
must
*NL*
stand
,
listen
,
and
tremble
;
and
such
was
literally
the
case
.
I
have
seen
*NL*
Colonel
Lloyd
make
old
Barney
,
a
man
between
fifty
and
sixty
years
of
*NL*
age
,
uncover
his
bald
head
,
kneel
down
upon
the
cold
,
damp
ground
,
and
*NL*
receive
upon
his
naked
and
toil-worn
shoulders
more
than
thirty
*NL*
lashes
at
the
time
.
Colonel
Lloyd
had
three
sons
--
Edward
,
Murray
,
and
*NL*
Daniel
,
--
and
three
sons-in-law
,
Mr.
Winder
,
Mr.
Nicholson
,
and
Mr.
*NL*
Lowndes
.
All
of
these
lived
at
the
Great
House
Farm
,
and
enjoyed
the
*NL*
luxury
of
whipping
the
servants
when
they
pleased
,
from
old
Barney
down
*NL*
to
William
Wilkes
,
the
coach-driver
.
I
have
seen
Winder
make
one
of
the
*NL*
house-servants
stand
off
from
him
a
suitable
distance
to
be
touched
with
*NL*
the
end
of
his
whip
,
and
at
every
stroke
raise
great
ridges
upon
his
*NL*
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
describe
the
wealth
of
Colonel
Lloyd
would
be
almost
equal
*NL*
to
describing
the
riches
of
Job
.
He
kept
from
ten
to
fifteen
*NL*
house-servants
.
He
was
said
to
own
a
thousand
slaves
,
and
I
think
this
*NL*
estimate
quite
within
the
truth
.
Colonel
Lloyd
owned
so
many
that
he
did
*NL*
not
know
them
when
he
saw
them
;
nor
did
all
the
slaves
of
the
out-farms
*NL*
know
him
.
It
is
reported
of
him
,
that
,
while
riding
along
the
road
one
*NL*
day
,
he
met
a
colored
man
,
and
addressed
him
in
the
usual
manner
of
*NL*
speaking
to
colored
people
on
the
public
highways
of
the
south
:
``
Well
,
*NL*
boy
,
whom
do
you
belong
to
?
''
``
To
Colonel
Lloyd
,
''
replied
the
slave
.
*NL*
``
Well
,
does
the
colonel
treat
you
well
?
''
``
No
,
sir
,
''
was
the
ready
reply
.
*NL*
``
What
,
does
he
work
you
too
hard
?
''
``
Yes
,
sir
.
''
``
Well
,
do
n't
he
give
you
*NL*
enough
to
eat
?
''
``
Yes
,
sir
,
he
gives
me
enough
,
such
as
it
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
colonel
,
after
ascertaining
where
the
slave
belonged
,
rode
on
;
*NL*
the
man
also
went
on
about
his
business
,
not
dreaming
that
he
had
been
*NL*
conversing
with
his
master
.
He
thought
,
said
,
and
heard
nothing
more
of
*NL*
the
matter
,
until
two
or
three
weeks
afterwards
.
The
poor
man
was
then
*NL*
informed
by
his
overseer
that
,
for
having
found
fault
with
his
master
,
*NL*
he
was
now
to
be
sold
to
a
Georgia
trader
.
He
was
immediately
chained
*NL*
and
handcuffed
;
and
thus
,
without
a
moment
's
warning
,
he
was
snatched
*NL*
away
,
and
forever
sundered
,
from
his
family
and
friends
,
by
a
hand
more
*NL*
unrelenting
than
death
.
This
is
the
penalty
of
telling
the
truth
,
of
*NL*
telling
the
simple
truth
,
in
answer
to
a
series
of
plain
questions
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
partly
in
consequence
of
such
facts
,
that
slaves
,
when
inquired
*NL*
of
as
to
their
condition
and
the
character
of
their
masters
,
almost
*NL*
universally
say
they
are
contented
,
and
that
their
masters
are
kind
.
*NL*
The
slaveholders
have
been
known
to
send
in
spies
among
their
slaves
,
*NL*
to
ascertain
their
views
and
feelings
in
regard
to
their
condition
.
The
*NL*
frequency
of
this
has
had
the
effect
to
establish
among
the
slaves
the
*NL*
maxim
,
that
a
still
tongue
makes
a
wise
head
.
They
suppress
the
truth
*NL*
rather
than
take
the
consequences
of
telling
it
,
and
in
so
doing
prove
*NL*
themselves
a
part
of
the
human
family
.
If
they
have
any
thing
to
say
of
*NL*
their
masters
,
it
is
generally
in
their
masters
'
favor
,
especially
when
*NL*
speaking
to
an
untried
man
.
I
have
been
frequently
asked
,
when
a
*NL*
slave
,
if
I
had
a
kind
master
,
and
do
not
remember
ever
to
have
given
a
*NL*
negative
answer
;
nor
did
I
,
in
pursuing
this
course
,
consider
myself
as
*NL*
uttering
what
was
absolutely
false
;
for
I
always
measured
the
kindness
*NL*
of
my
master
by
the
standard
of
kindness
set
up
among
slaveholders
*NL*
around
us
.
Moreover
,
slaves
are
like
other
people
,
and
imbibe
prejudices
*NL*
quite
common
to
others
.
They
think
their
own
better
than
that
of
others
.
*NL*
Many
,
under
the
influence
of
this
prejudice
,
think
their
own
masters
are
*NL*
better
than
the
masters
of
other
slaves
;
and
this
,
too
,
in
some
cases
,
*NL*
when
the
very
reverse
is
true
.
Indeed
,
it
is
not
uncommon
for
slaves
*NL*
even
to
fall
out
and
quarrel
among
themselves
about
the
relative
*NL*
goodness
of
their
masters
,
each
contending
for
the
superior
goodness
of
*NL*
his
own
over
that
of
the
others
.
At
the
very
same
time
,
they
mutually
*NL*
execrate
their
masters
when
viewed
separately
.
It
was
so
on
our
*NL*
plantation
.
When
Colonel
Lloyd
's
slaves
met
the
slaves
of
Jacob
Jepson
,
*NL*
they
seldom
parted
without
a
quarrel
about
their
masters
;
Colonel
*NL*
Lloyd
's
slaves
contending
that
he
was
the
richest
,
and
Mr.
Jepson
's
*NL*
slaves
that
he
was
the
smartest
,
and
most
of
a
man
.
Colonel
Lloyd
's
*NL*
slaves
would
boast
his
ability
to
buy
and
sell
Jacob
Jepson
.
Mr.
*NL*
Jepson
's
slaves
would
boast
his
ability
to
whip
Colonel
Lloyd
.
These
*NL*
quarrels
would
almost
always
end
in
a
fight
between
the
parties
,
and
*NL*
those
that
whipped
were
supposed
to
have
gained
the
point
at
issue
.
They
*NL*
seemed
to
think
that
the
greatness
of
their
masters
was
transferable
to
*NL*
themselves
.
It
was
considered
as
being
bad
enough
to
be
a
slave
;
but
to
*NL*
be
a
poor
man
's
slave
was
deemed
a
disgrace
indeed
!

CHAPTER
IV
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Hopkins
remained
but
a
short
time
in
the
office
of
overseer
.
Why
his
*NL*
career
was
so
short
,
I
do
not
know
,
but
suppose
he
lacked
the
necessary
*NL*
severity
to
suit
Colonel
Lloyd
.
Mr.
Hopkins
was
succeeded
by
Mr.
Austin
*NL*
Gore
,
a
man
possessing
,
in
an
eminent
degree
,
all
those
traits
of
*NL*
character
indispensable
to
what
is
called
a
first-rate
overseer
.
Mr.
*NL*
Gore
had
served
Colonel
Lloyd
,
in
the
capacity
of
overseer
,
upon
one
*NL*
of
the
out-farms
,
and
had
shown
himself
worthy
of
the
high
station
of
*NL*
overseer
upon
the
home
or
Great
House
Farm
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Gore
was
proud
,
ambitious
,
and
persevering
.
He
was
artful
,
cruel
,
*NL*
and
obdurate
.
He
was
just
the
man
for
such
a
place
,
and
it
was
just
the
*NL*
place
for
such
a
man
.
It
afforded
scope
for
the
full
exercise
of
all
his
*NL*
powers
,
and
he
seemed
to
be
perfectly
at
home
in
it
.
He
was
one
of
those
*NL*
who
could
torture
the
slightest
look
,
word
,
or
gesture
,
on
the
part
of
*NL*
the
slave
,
into
impudence
,
and
would
treat
it
accordingly
.
There
must
*NL*
be
no
answering
back
to
him
;
no
explanation
was
allowed
a
slave
,
showing
*NL*
himself
to
have
been
wrongfully
accused
.
Mr.
Gore
acted
fully
up
to
*NL*
the
maxim
laid
down
by
slaveholders
,
--
``
It
is
better
that
a
dozen
*NL*
slaves
should
suffer
under
the
lash
,
than
that
the
overseer
should
be
*NL*
convicted
,
in
the
presence
of
the
slaves
,
of
having
been
at
fault
.
''
*NL*
No
matter
how
innocent
a
slave
might
be
--
it
availed
him
nothing
,
*NL*
when
accused
by
Mr.
Gore
of
any
misdemeanor
.
To
be
accused
was
to
*NL*
be
convicted
,
and
to
be
convicted
was
to
be
punished
;
the
one
always
*NL*
following
the
other
with
immutable
certainty
.
To
escape
punishment
was
*NL*
to
escape
accusation
;
and
few
slaves
had
the
fortune
to
do
either
,
under
*NL*
the
overseership
of
Mr.
Gore
.
He
was
just
proud
enough
to
demand
the
*NL*
most
debasing
homage
of
the
slave
,
and
quite
servile
enough
to
crouch
,
*NL*
himself
,
at
the
feet
of
the
master
.
He
was
ambitious
enough
to
be
*NL*
contented
with
nothing
short
of
the
highest
rank
of
overseers
,
and
*NL*
persevering
enough
to
reach
the
height
of
his
ambition
.
He
was
cruel
*NL*
enough
to
inflict
the
severest
punishment
,
artful
enough
to
descend
to
*NL*
the
lowest
trickery
,
and
obdurate
enough
to
be
insensible
to
the
voice
*NL*
of
a
reproving
conscience
.
He
was
,
of
all
the
overseers
,
the
most
*NL*
dreaded
by
the
slaves
.
His
presence
was
painful
;
his
eye
flashed
*NL*
confusion
;
and
seldom
was
his
sharp
,
shrill
voice
heard
,
without
*NL*
producing
horror
and
trembling
in
their
ranks
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Gore
was
a
grave
man
,
and
,
though
a
young
man
,
he
indulged
in
no
*NL*
jokes
,
said
no
funny
words
,
seldom
smiled
.
His
words
were
in
perfect
*NL*
keeping
with
his
looks
,
and
his
looks
were
in
perfect
keeping
with
his
*NL*
words
.
Overseers
will
sometimes
indulge
in
a
witty
word
,
even
with
the
*NL*
slaves
;
not
so
with
Mr.
Gore
.
He
spoke
but
to
command
,
and
commanded
but
*NL*
to
be
obeyed
;
he
dealt
sparingly
with
his
words
,
and
bountifully
with
*NL*
his
whip
,
never
using
the
former
where
the
latter
would
answer
as
well
.
*NL*
When
he
whipped
,
he
seemed
to
do
so
from
a
sense
of
duty
,
and
feared
no
*NL*
consequences
.
He
did
nothing
reluctantly
,
no
matter
how
disagreeable
;
*NL*
always
at
his
post
,
never
inconsistent
.
He
never
promised
but
to
fulfil
.
*NL*
He
was
,
in
a
word
,
a
man
of
the
most
inflexible
firmness
and
stone-like
*NL*
coolness
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
savage
barbarity
was
equalled
only
by
the
consummate
coolness
with
*NL*
which
he
committed
the
grossest
and
most
savage
deeds
upon
the
slaves
*NL*
under
his
charge
.
Mr.
Gore
once
undertook
to
whip
one
of
Colonel
Lloyd
's
*NL*
slaves
,
by
the
name
of
Demby
.
He
had
given
Demby
but
few
stripes
,
when
,
*NL*
to
get
rid
of
the
scourging
,
he
ran
and
plunged
himself
into
a
creek
,
*NL*
and
stood
there
at
the
depth
of
his
shoulders
,
refusing
to
come
out
.
Mr.
*NL*
Gore
told
him
that
he
would
give
him
three
calls
,
and
that
,
if
he
did
*NL*
not
come
out
at
the
third
call
,
he
would
shoot
him
.
The
first
call
was
*NL*
given
.
Demby
made
no
response
,
but
stood
his
ground
.
The
second
and
*NL*
third
calls
were
given
with
the
same
result
.
Mr.
Gore
then
,
without
*NL*
consultation
or
deliberation
with
any
one
,
not
even
giving
Demby
an
*NL*
additional
call
,
raised
his
musket
to
his
face
,
taking
deadly
aim
at
his
*NL*
standing
victim
,
and
in
an
instant
poor
Demby
was
no
more
.
His
mangled
*NL*
body
sank
out
of
sight
,
and
blood
and
brains
marked
the
water
where
he
*NL*
had
stood
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
thrill
of
horror
flashed
through
every
soul
upon
the
plantation
,
*NL*
excepting
Mr.
Gore
.
He
alone
seemed
cool
and
collected
.
He
was
asked
by
*NL*
Colonel
Lloyd
and
my
old
master
,
why
he
resorted
to
this
extraordinary
*NL*
expedient
.
His
reply
was
,
-LRB-
as
well
as
I
can
remember
,
-RRB-
that
Demby
had
*NL*
become
unmanageable
.
He
was
setting
a
dangerous
example
to
the
other
*NL*
slaves
,
--
one
which
,
if
suffered
to
pass
without
some
such
demonstration
*NL*
on
his
part
,
would
finally
lead
to
the
total
subversion
of
all
rule
and
*NL*
order
upon
the
plantation
.
He
argued
that
if
one
slave
refused
to
be
*NL*
corrected
,
and
escaped
with
his
life
,
the
other
slaves
would
soon
copy
*NL*
the
example
;
the
result
of
which
would
be
,
the
freedom
of
the
slaves
,
*NL*
and
the
enslavement
of
the
whites
.
Mr.
Gore
's
defence
was
satisfactory
.
*NL*
He
was
continued
in
his
station
as
overseer
upon
the
home
plantation
.
*NL*
His
fame
as
an
overseer
went
abroad
.
His
horrid
crime
was
not
even
*NL*
submitted
to
judicial
investigation
.
It
was
committed
in
the
presence
of
*NL*
slaves
,
and
they
of
course
could
neither
institute
a
suit
,
nor
testify
*NL*
against
him
;
and
thus
the
guilty
perpetrator
of
one
of
the
bloodiest
*NL*
and
most
foul
murders
goes
unwhipped
of
justice
,
and
uncensured
by
the
*NL*
community
in
which
he
lives
.
Mr.
Gore
lived
in
St.
Michael
's
,
Talbot
*NL*
county
,
Maryland
,
when
I
left
there
;
and
if
he
is
still
alive
,
he
very
*NL*
probably
lives
there
now
;
and
if
so
,
he
is
now
,
as
he
was
then
,
as
*NL*
highly
esteemed
and
as
much
respected
as
though
his
guilty
soul
had
not
*NL*
been
stained
with
his
brother
's
blood
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
speak
advisedly
when
I
say
this
,
--
that
killing
a
slave
,
or
any
colored
*NL*
person
,
in
Talbot
county
,
Maryland
,
is
not
treated
as
a
crime
,
either
by
*NL*
the
courts
or
the
community
.
Mr.
Thomas
Lanman
,
of
St.
Michael
's
,
killed
*NL*
two
slaves
,
one
of
whom
he
killed
with
a
hatchet
,
by
knocking
his
brains
*NL*
out
.
He
used
to
boast
of
the
commission
of
the
awful
and
bloody
deed
.
I
*NL*
have
heard
him
do
so
laughingly
,
saying
,
among
other
things
,
that
he
was
*NL*
the
only
benefactor
of
his
country
in
the
company
,
and
that
when
others
*NL*
would
do
as
much
as
he
had
done
,
we
should
be
relieved
of
``
the
d
--
d
*NL*
niggers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
wife
of
Mr.
Giles
Hicks
,
living
but
a
short
distance
from
where
I
*NL*
used
to
live
,
murdered
my
wife
's
cousin
,
a
young
girl
between
fifteen
*NL*
and
sixteen
years
of
age
,
mangling
her
person
in
the
most
horrible
*NL*
manner
,
breaking
her
nose
and
breastbone
with
a
stick
,
so
that
the
poor
*NL*
girl
expired
in
a
few
hours
afterward
.
She
was
immediately
buried
,
but
*NL*
had
not
been
in
her
untimely
grave
but
a
few
hours
before
she
was
taken
*NL*
up
and
examined
by
the
coroner
,
who
decided
that
she
had
come
to
her
*NL*
death
by
severe
beating
.
The
offence
for
which
this
girl
was
thus
*NL*
murdered
was
this
:
--
She
had
been
set
that
night
to
mind
Mrs.
Hicks
's
*NL*
baby
,
and
during
the
night
she
fell
asleep
,
and
the
baby
cried
.
She
,
*NL*
having
lost
her
rest
for
several
nights
previous
,
did
not
hear
the
*NL*
crying
.
They
were
both
in
the
room
with
Mrs.
Hicks
.
Mrs.
Hicks
,
finding
*NL*
the
girl
slow
to
move
,
jumped
from
her
bed
,
seized
an
oak
stick
of
wood
*NL*
by
the
fireplace
,
and
with
it
broke
the
girl
's
nose
and
breastbone
,
*NL*
and
thus
ended
her
life
.
I
will
not
say
that
this
most
horrid
murder
*NL*
produced
no
sensation
in
the
community
.
It
did
produce
sensation
,
but
*NL*
not
enough
to
bring
the
murderess
to
punishment
.
There
was
a
warrant
*NL*
issued
for
her
arrest
,
but
it
was
never
served
.
Thus
she
escaped
not
*NL*
only
punishment
,
but
even
the
pain
of
being
arraigned
before
a
court
for
*NL*
her
horrid
crime
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whilst
I
am
detailing
bloody
deeds
which
took
place
during
my
stay
*NL*
on
Colonel
Lloyd
's
plantation
,
I
will
briefly
narrate
another
,
which
*NL*
occurred
about
the
same
time
as
the
murder
of
Demby
by
Mr.
Gore
.
*NL*
*NL*
Colonel
Lloyd
's
slaves
were
in
the
habit
of
spending
a
part
of
their
*NL*
nights
and
Sundays
in
fishing
for
oysters
,
and
in
this
way
made
up
the
*NL*
deficiency
of
their
scanty
allowance
.
An
old
man
belonging
to
Colonel
*NL*
Lloyd
,
while
thus
engaged
,
happened
to
get
beyond
the
limits
of
Colonel
*NL*
Lloyd
's
,
and
on
the
premises
of
Mr.
Beal
Bondly
.
At
this
trespass
,
Mr.
*NL*
Bondly
took
offence
,
and
with
his
musket
came
down
to
the
shore
,
and
*NL*
blew
its
deadly
contents
into
the
poor
old
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bondly
came
over
to
see
Colonel
Lloyd
the
next
day
,
whether
to
pay
*NL*
him
for
his
property
,
or
to
justify
himself
in
what
he
had
done
,
I
know
*NL*
not
.
At
any
rate
,
this
whole
fiendish
transaction
was
soon
hushed
up
.
*NL*
There
was
very
little
said
about
it
at
all
,
and
nothing
done
.
It
was
*NL*
a
common
saying
,
even
among
little
white
boys
,
that
it
was
worth
a
*NL*
half-cent
to
kill
a
``
nigger
,
''
and
a
half-cent
to
bury
one
.

CHAPTER
V
*NL*
*NL*
As
to
my
own
treatment
while
I
lived
on
Colonel
Lloyd
's
plantation
,
*NL*
it
was
very
similar
to
that
of
the
other
slave
children
.
I
was
not
old
*NL*
enough
to
work
in
the
field
,
and
there
being
little
else
than
field
work
*NL*
to
do
,
I
had
a
great
deal
of
leisure
time
.
The
most
I
had
to
do
was
to
*NL*
drive
up
the
cows
at
evening
,
keep
the
fowls
out
of
the
garden
,
keep
the
*NL*
front
yard
clean
,
and
run
of
errands
for
my
old
master
's
daughter
,
Mrs.
*NL*
Lucretia
Auld
.
The
most
of
my
leisure
time
I
spent
in
helping
Master
*NL*
Daniel
Lloyd
in
finding
his
birds
,
after
he
had
shot
them
.
My
connection
*NL*
with
Master
Daniel
was
of
some
advantage
to
me
.
He
became
quite
attached
*NL*
to
me
,
and
was
a
sort
of
protector
of
me
.
He
would
not
allow
the
older
*NL*
boys
to
impose
upon
me
,
and
would
divide
his
cakes
with
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
seldom
whipped
by
my
old
master
,
and
suffered
little
from
any
*NL*
thing
else
than
hunger
and
cold
.
I
suffered
much
from
hunger
,
but
much
*NL*
more
from
cold
.
In
hottest
summer
and
coldest
winter
,
I
was
kept
almost
*NL*
naked
--
no
shoes
,
no
stockings
,
no
jacket
,
no
trousers
,
nothing
on
but
a
*NL*
coarse
tow
linen
shirt
,
reaching
only
to
my
knees
.
I
had
no
bed
.
I
must
*NL*
have
perished
with
cold
,
but
that
,
the
coldest
nights
,
I
used
to
steal
*NL*
a
bag
which
was
used
for
carrying
corn
to
the
mill
.
I
would
crawl
into
*NL*
this
bag
,
and
there
sleep
on
the
cold
,
damp
,
clay
floor
,
with
my
head
in
*NL*
and
feet
out
.
My
feet
have
been
so
cracked
with
the
frost
,
that
the
pen
*NL*
with
which
I
am
writing
might
be
laid
in
the
gashes
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
were
not
regularly
allowanced
.
Our
food
was
coarse
corn
meal
boiled
.
*NL*
This
was
called
_
mush
_
.
It
was
put
into
a
large
wooden
tray
or
trough
,
*NL*
and
set
down
upon
the
ground
.
The
children
were
then
called
,
like
so
*NL*
many
pigs
,
and
like
so
many
pigs
they
would
come
and
devour
the
mush
;
*NL*
some
with
oyster-shells
,
others
with
pieces
of
shingle
,
some
with
naked
*NL*
hands
,
and
none
with
spoons
.
He
that
ate
fastest
got
most
;
he
that
was
*NL*
strongest
secured
the
best
place
;
and
few
left
the
trough
satisfied
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
probably
between
seven
and
eight
years
old
when
I
left
Colonel
*NL*
Lloyd
's
plantation
.
I
left
it
with
joy
.
I
shall
never
forget
the
ecstasy
*NL*
with
which
I
received
the
intelligence
that
my
old
master
-LRB-
Anthony
-RRB-
*NL*
had
determined
to
let
me
go
to
Baltimore
,
to
live
with
Mr.
Hugh
Auld
,
*NL*
brother
to
my
old
master
's
son-in-law
,
Captain
Thomas
Auld
.
I
received
*NL*
this
information
about
three
days
before
my
departure
.
They
were
three
*NL*
of
the
happiest
days
I
ever
enjoyed
.
I
spent
the
most
part
of
all
these
*NL*
three
days
in
the
creek
,
washing
off
the
plantation
scurf
,
and
preparing
*NL*
myself
for
my
departure
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
pride
of
appearance
which
this
would
indicate
was
not
my
own
.
I
*NL*
spent
the
time
in
washing
,
not
so
much
because
I
wished
to
,
but
because
*NL*
Mrs.
Lucretia
had
told
me
I
must
get
all
the
dead
skin
off
my
feet
and
*NL*
knees
before
I
could
go
to
Baltimore
;
for
the
people
in
Baltimore
were
*NL*
very
cleanly
,
and
would
laugh
at
me
if
I
looked
dirty
.
Besides
,
she
was
*NL*
going
to
give
me
a
pair
of
trousers
,
which
I
should
not
put
on
unless
*NL*
I
got
all
the
dirt
off
me
.
The
thought
of
owning
a
pair
of
trousers
was
*NL*
great
indeed
!
It
was
almost
a
sufficient
motive
,
not
only
to
make
me
*NL*
take
off
what
would
be
called
by
pig-drovers
the
mange
,
but
the
skin
*NL*
itself
.
I
went
at
it
in
good
earnest
,
working
for
the
first
time
with
*NL*
the
hope
of
reward
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
ties
that
ordinarily
bind
children
to
their
homes
were
all
suspended
*NL*
in
my
case
.
I
found
no
severe
trial
in
my
departure
.
My
home
was
*NL*
charmless
;
it
was
not
home
to
me
;
on
parting
from
it
,
I
could
not
feel
*NL*
that
I
was
leaving
any
thing
which
I
could
have
enjoyed
by
staying
.
My
*NL*
mother
was
dead
,
my
grandmother
lived
far
off
,
so
that
I
seldom
saw
her
.
*NL*
I
had
two
sisters
and
one
brother
,
that
lived
in
the
same
house
with
me
;
*NL*
but
the
early
separation
of
us
from
our
mother
had
well
nigh
blotted
the
*NL*
fact
of
our
relationship
from
our
memories
.
I
looked
for
home
elsewhere
,
*NL*
and
was
confident
of
finding
none
which
I
should
relish
less
than
the
*NL*
one
which
I
was
leaving
.
If
,
however
,
I
found
in
my
new
home
hardship
,
*NL*
hunger
,
whipping
,
and
nakedness
,
I
had
the
consolation
that
I
should
not
*NL*
have
escaped
any
one
of
them
by
staying
.
Having
already
had
more
than
*NL*
a
taste
of
them
in
the
house
of
my
old
master
,
and
having
endured
them
*NL*
there
,
I
very
naturally
inferred
my
ability
to
endure
them
elsewhere
,
*NL*
and
especially
at
Baltimore
;
for
I
had
something
of
the
feeling
about
*NL*
Baltimore
that
is
expressed
in
the
proverb
,
that
``
being
hanged
in
*NL*
England
is
preferable
to
dying
a
natural
death
in
Ireland
.
''
I
had
the
*NL*
strongest
desire
to
see
Baltimore
.
Cousin
Tom
,
though
not
fluent
in
*NL*
speech
,
had
inspired
me
with
that
desire
by
his
eloquent
description
*NL*
of
the
place
.
I
could
never
point
out
any
thing
at
the
Great
House
,
*NL*
no
matter
how
beautiful
or
powerful
,
but
that
he
had
seen
something
at
*NL*
Baltimore
far
exceeding
,
both
in
beauty
and
strength
,
the
object
which
I
*NL*
pointed
out
to
him
.
Even
the
Great
House
itself
,
with
all
its
pictures
,
*NL*
was
far
inferior
to
many
buildings
in
Baltimore
.
So
strong
was
my
*NL*
desire
,
that
I
thought
a
gratification
of
it
would
fully
compensate
*NL*
for
whatever
loss
of
comforts
I
should
sustain
by
the
exchange
.
I
left
*NL*
without
a
regret
,
and
with
the
highest
hopes
of
future
happiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
sailed
out
of
Miles
River
for
Baltimore
on
a
Saturday
morning
.
I
*NL*
remember
only
the
day
of
the
week
,
for
at
that
time
I
had
no
knowledge
*NL*
of
the
days
of
the
month
,
nor
the
months
of
the
year
.
On
setting
sail
,
I
*NL*
walked
aft
,
and
gave
to
Colonel
Lloyd
's
plantation
what
I
hoped
would
be
*NL*
the
last
look
.
I
then
placed
myself
in
the
bows
of
the
sloop
,
and
there
*NL*
spent
the
remainder
of
the
day
in
looking
ahead
,
interesting
myself
in
*NL*
what
was
in
the
distance
rather
than
in
things
near
by
or
behind
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
afternoon
of
that
day
,
we
reached
Annapolis
,
the
capital
of
the
*NL*
State
.
We
stopped
but
a
few
moments
,
so
that
I
had
no
time
to
go
on
*NL*
shore
.
It
was
the
first
large
town
that
I
had
ever
seen
,
and
though
it
*NL*
would
look
small
compared
with
some
of
our
New
England
factory
villages
,
*NL*
I
thought
it
a
wonderful
place
for
its
size
--
more
imposing
even
than
the
*NL*
Great
House
Farm
!
*NL*
*NL*
We
arrived
at
Baltimore
early
on
Sunday
morning
,
landing
at
Smith
's
*NL*
Wharf
,
not
far
from
Bowley
's
Wharf
.
We
had
on
board
the
sloop
a
large
*NL*
flock
of
sheep
;
and
after
aiding
in
driving
them
to
the
slaughterhouse
*NL*
of
Mr.
Curtis
on
Louden
Slater
's
Hill
,
I
was
conducted
by
Rich
,
one
of
*NL*
the
hands
belonging
on
board
of
the
sloop
,
to
my
new
home
in
Alliciana
*NL*
Street
,
near
Mr.
Gardner
's
ship-yard
,
on
Fells
Point
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Auld
were
both
at
home
,
and
met
me
at
the
door
with
their
*NL*
little
son
Thomas
,
to
take
care
of
whom
I
had
been
given
.
And
here
I
saw
*NL*
what
I
had
never
seen
before
;
it
was
a
white
face
beaming
with
the
most
*NL*
kindly
emotions
;
it
was
the
face
of
my
new
mistress
,
Sophia
Auld
.
I
wish
*NL*
I
could
describe
the
rapture
that
flashed
through
my
soul
as
I
beheld
*NL*
it
.
It
was
a
new
and
strange
sight
to
me
,
brightening
up
my
pathway
*NL*
with
the
light
of
happiness
.
Little
Thomas
was
told
,
there
was
his
*NL*
Freddy
,
--
and
I
was
told
to
take
care
of
little
Thomas
;
and
thus
I
entered
*NL*
upon
the
duties
of
my
new
home
with
the
most
cheering
prospect
ahead
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
look
upon
my
departure
from
Colonel
Lloyd
's
plantation
as
one
of
*NL*
the
most
interesting
events
of
my
life
.
It
is
possible
,
and
even
quite
*NL*
probable
,
that
but
for
the
mere
circumstance
of
being
removed
from
that
*NL*
plantation
to
Baltimore
,
I
should
have
to-day
,
instead
of
being
here
*NL*
seated
by
my
own
table
,
in
the
enjoyment
of
freedom
and
the
happiness
*NL*
of
home
,
writing
this
Narrative
,
been
confined
in
the
galling
chains
of
*NL*
slavery
.
Going
to
live
at
Baltimore
laid
the
foundation
,
and
opened
the
*NL*
gateway
,
to
all
my
subsequent
prosperity
.
I
have
ever
regarded
it
as
the
*NL*
first
plain
manifestation
of
that
kind
providence
which
has
ever
since
*NL*
attended
me
,
and
marked
my
life
with
so
many
favors
.
I
regarded
the
*NL*
selection
of
myself
as
being
somewhat
remarkable
.
There
were
a
number
*NL*
of
slave
children
that
might
have
been
sent
from
the
plantation
to
*NL*
Baltimore
.
There
were
those
younger
,
those
older
,
and
those
of
the
same
*NL*
age
.
I
was
chosen
from
among
them
all
,
and
was
the
first
,
last
,
and
only
*NL*
choice
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
may
be
deemed
superstitious
,
and
even
egotistical
,
in
regarding
this
*NL*
event
as
a
special
interposition
of
divine
Providence
in
my
favor
.
But
*NL*
I
should
be
false
to
the
earliest
sentiments
of
my
soul
,
if
I
suppressed
*NL*
the
opinion
.
I
prefer
to
be
true
to
myself
,
even
at
the
hazard
of
*NL*
incurring
the
ridicule
of
others
,
rather
than
to
be
false
,
and
incur
my
*NL*
own
abhorrence
.
From
my
earliest
recollection
,
I
date
the
entertainment
*NL*
of
a
deep
conviction
that
slavery
would
not
always
be
able
to
hold
*NL*
me
within
its
foul
embrace
;
and
in
the
darkest
hours
of
my
career
in
*NL*
slavery
,
this
living
word
of
faith
and
spirit
of
hope
departed
not
from
*NL*
me
,
but
remained
like
ministering
angels
to
cheer
me
through
the
gloom
.
*NL*
This
good
spirit
was
from
God
,
and
to
him
I
offer
thanksgiving
and
*NL*
praise
.

CHAPTER
VI
*NL*
*NL*
My
new
mistress
proved
to
be
all
she
appeared
when
I
first
met
her
at
*NL*
the
door
,
--
a
woman
of
the
kindest
heart
and
finest
feelings
.
She
had
*NL*
never
had
a
slave
under
her
control
previously
to
myself
,
and
prior
to
*NL*
her
marriage
she
had
been
dependent
upon
her
own
industry
for
a
living
.
*NL*
She
was
by
trade
a
weaver
;
and
by
constant
application
to
her
business
,
*NL*
she
had
been
in
a
good
degree
preserved
from
the
blighting
and
*NL*
dehumanizing
effects
of
slavery
.
I
was
utterly
astonished
at
her
*NL*
goodness
.
I
scarcely
knew
how
to
behave
towards
her
.
She
was
entirely
*NL*
unlike
any
other
white
woman
I
had
ever
seen
.
I
could
not
approach
her
*NL*
as
I
was
accustomed
to
approach
other
white
ladies
.
My
early
instruction
*NL*
was
all
out
of
place
.
The
crouching
servility
,
usually
so
acceptable
a
*NL*
quality
in
a
slave
,
did
not
answer
when
manifested
toward
her
.
Her
favor
*NL*
was
not
gained
by
it
;
she
seemed
to
be
disturbed
by
it
.
She
did
not
*NL*
deem
it
impudent
or
unmannerly
for
a
slave
to
look
her
in
the
face
.
*NL*
The
meanest
slave
was
put
fully
at
ease
in
her
presence
,
and
none
*NL*
left
without
feeling
better
for
having
seen
her
.
Her
face
was
made
of
*NL*
heavenly
smiles
,
and
her
voice
of
tranquil
music
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
alas
!
this
kind
heart
had
but
a
short
time
to
remain
such
.
The
*NL*
fatal
poison
of
irresponsible
power
was
already
in
her
hands
,
and
soon
*NL*
commenced
its
infernal
work
.
That
cheerful
eye
,
under
the
influence
*NL*
of
slavery
,
soon
became
red
with
rage
;
that
voice
,
made
all
of
sweet
*NL*
accord
,
changed
to
one
of
harsh
and
horrid
discord
;
and
that
angelic
*NL*
face
gave
place
to
that
of
a
demon
.
*NL*
*NL*
Very
soon
after
I
went
to
live
with
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Auld
,
she
very
kindly
*NL*
commenced
to
teach
me
the
A
,
B
,
C
.
After
I
had
learned
this
,
she
*NL*
assisted
me
in
learning
to
spell
words
of
three
or
four
letters
.
Just
at
*NL*
this
point
of
my
progress
,
Mr.
Auld
found
out
what
was
going
on
,
and
at
*NL*
once
forbade
Mrs.
Auld
to
instruct
me
further
,
telling
her
,
among
other
*NL*
things
,
that
it
was
unlawful
,
as
well
as
unsafe
,
to
teach
a
slave
to
*NL*
read
.
To
use
his
own
words
,
further
,
he
said
,
``
If
you
give
a
nigger
an
*NL*
inch
,
he
will
take
an
ell
.
A
nigger
should
know
nothing
but
to
obey
his
*NL*
master
--
to
do
as
he
is
told
to
do
.
Learning
would
_
spoil
_
the
best
nigger
*NL*
in
the
world
.
Now
,
''
said
he
,
``
if
you
teach
that
nigger
-LRB-
speaking
of
*NL*
myself
-RRB-
how
to
read
,
there
would
be
no
keeping
him
.
It
would
forever
*NL*
unfit
him
to
be
a
slave
.
He
would
at
once
become
unmanageable
,
and
of
no
*NL*
value
to
his
master
.
As
to
himself
,
it
could
do
him
no
good
,
but
a
great
*NL*
deal
of
harm
.
It
would
make
him
discontented
and
unhappy
.
''
These
*NL*
words
sank
deep
into
my
heart
,
stirred
up
sentiments
within
that
lay
*NL*
slumbering
,
and
called
into
existence
an
entirely
new
train
of
thought
.
*NL*
It
was
a
new
and
special
revelation
,
explaining
dark
and
mysterious
*NL*
things
,
with
which
my
youthful
understanding
had
struggled
,
but
*NL*
struggled
in
vain
.
I
now
understood
what
had
been
to
me
a
most
*NL*
perplexing
difficulty
--
to
wit
,
the
white
man
's
power
to
enslave
the
*NL*
black
man
.
It
was
a
grand
achievement
,
and
I
prized
it
highly
.
From
that
*NL*
moment
,
I
understood
the
pathway
from
slavery
to
freedom
.
It
was
just
*NL*
what
I
wanted
,
and
I
got
it
at
a
time
when
I
the
least
expected
it
.
*NL*
Whilst
I
was
saddened
by
the
thought
of
losing
the
aid
of
my
kind
*NL*
mistress
,
I
was
gladdened
by
the
invaluable
instruction
which
,
by
the
*NL*
merest
accident
,
I
had
gained
from
my
master
.
Though
conscious
of
the
*NL*
difficulty
of
learning
without
a
teacher
,
I
set
out
with
high
hope
,
and
*NL*
a
fixed
purpose
,
at
whatever
cost
of
trouble
,
to
learn
how
to
read
.
The
*NL*
very
decided
manner
with
which
he
spoke
,
and
strove
to
impress
his
wife
*NL*
with
the
evil
consequences
of
giving
me
instruction
,
served
to
convince
*NL*
me
that
he
was
deeply
sensible
of
the
truths
he
was
uttering
.
It
gave
me
*NL*
the
best
assurance
that
I
might
rely
with
the
utmost
confidence
on
the
*NL*
results
which
,
he
said
,
would
flow
from
teaching
me
to
read
.
What
he
*NL*
most
dreaded
,
that
I
most
desired
.
What
he
most
loved
,
that
I
most
*NL*
hated
.
That
which
to
him
was
a
great
evil
,
to
be
carefully
shunned
,
was
*NL*
to
me
a
great
good
,
to
be
diligently
sought
;
and
the
argument
which
he
*NL*
so
warmly
urged
,
against
my
learning
to
read
,
only
served
to
inspire
*NL*
me
with
a
desire
and
determination
to
learn
.
In
learning
to
read
,
I
owe
*NL*
almost
as
much
to
the
bitter
opposition
of
my
master
,
as
to
the
kindly
*NL*
aid
of
my
mistress
.
I
acknowledge
the
benefit
of
both
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
resided
but
a
short
time
in
Baltimore
before
I
observed
a
marked
*NL*
difference
,
in
the
treatment
of
slaves
,
from
that
which
I
had
witnessed
*NL*
in
the
country
.
A
city
slave
is
almost
a
freeman
,
compared
with
a
*NL*
slave
on
the
plantation
.
He
is
much
better
fed
and
clothed
,
and
enjoys
*NL*
privileges
altogether
unknown
to
the
slave
on
the
plantation
.
There
is
*NL*
a
vestige
of
decency
,
a
sense
of
shame
,
that
does
much
to
curb
and
*NL*
check
those
outbreaks
of
atrocious
cruelty
so
commonly
enacted
upon
the
*NL*
plantation
.
He
is
a
desperate
slaveholder
,
who
will
shock
the
humanity
*NL*
of
his
non-slaveholding
neighbors
with
the
cries
of
his
lacerated
slave
.
*NL*
Few
are
willing
to
incur
the
odium
attaching
to
the
reputation
of
being
*NL*
a
cruel
master
;
and
above
all
things
,
they
would
not
be
known
as
not
*NL*
giving
a
slave
enough
to
eat
.
Every
city
slaveholder
is
anxious
to
have
*NL*
it
known
of
him
,
that
he
feeds
his
slaves
well
;
and
it
is
due
to
them
*NL*
to
say
,
that
most
of
them
do
give
their
slaves
enough
to
eat
.
There
are
,
*NL*
however
,
some
painful
exceptions
to
this
rule
.
Directly
opposite
to
us
,
*NL*
on
Philpot
Street
,
lived
Mr.
Thomas
Hamilton
.
He
owned
two
slaves
.
Their
*NL*
names
were
Henrietta
and
Mary
.
Henrietta
was
about
twenty-two
years
*NL*
of
age
,
Mary
was
about
fourteen
;
and
of
all
the
mangled
and
emaciated
*NL*
creatures
I
ever
looked
upon
,
these
two
were
the
most
so
.
His
heart
*NL*
must
be
harder
than
stone
,
that
could
look
upon
these
unmoved
.
The
*NL*
head
,
neck
,
and
shoulders
of
Mary
were
literally
cut
to
pieces
.
I
have
*NL*
frequently
felt
her
head
,
and
found
it
nearly
covered
with
festering
*NL*
sores
,
caused
by
the
lash
of
her
cruel
mistress
.
I
do
not
know
that
her
*NL*
master
ever
whipped
her
,
but
I
have
been
an
eye-witness
to
the
cruelty
*NL*
of
Mrs.
Hamilton
.
I
used
to
be
in
Mr.
Hamilton
's
house
nearly
every
day
.
*NL*
Mrs.
Hamilton
used
to
sit
in
a
large
chair
in
the
middle
of
the
room
,
*NL*
with
a
heavy
cowskin
always
by
her
side
,
and
scarce
an
hour
passed
*NL*
during
the
day
but
was
marked
by
the
blood
of
one
of
these
slaves
.
The
*NL*
girls
seldom
passed
her
without
her
saying
,
``
Move
faster
,
you
_
black
*NL*
gip
!
_
''
at
the
same
time
giving
them
a
blow
with
the
cowskin
over
the
*NL*
head
or
shoulders
,
often
drawing
the
blood
.
She
would
then
say
,
``
Take
*NL*
that
,
you
_
black
gip
!
_
''
continuing
,
``
If
you
do
n't
move
faster
,
I
'll
move
*NL*
you
!
''
Added
to
the
cruel
lashings
to
which
these
slaves
were
subjected
,
*NL*
they
were
kept
nearly
half-starved
.
They
seldom
knew
what
it
was
to
eat
*NL*
a
full
meal
.
I
have
seen
Mary
contending
with
the
pigs
for
the
offal
*NL*
thrown
into
the
street
.
So
much
was
Mary
kicked
and
cut
to
pieces
,
that
*NL*
she
was
oftener
called
''
_
pecked
_
''
than
by
her
name
.

CHAPTER
VII
*NL*
*NL*
I
lived
in
Master
Hugh
's
family
about
seven
years
.
During
this
time
,
I
*NL*
succeeded
in
learning
to
read
and
write
.
In
accomplishing
this
,
I
was
*NL*
compelled
to
resort
to
various
stratagems
.
I
had
no
regular
teacher
.
My
*NL*
mistress
,
who
had
kindly
commenced
to
instruct
me
,
had
,
in
compliance
*NL*
with
the
advice
and
direction
of
her
husband
,
not
only
ceased
to
*NL*
instruct
,
but
had
set
her
face
against
my
being
instructed
by
any
one
*NL*
else
.
It
is
due
,
however
,
to
my
mistress
to
say
of
her
,
that
she
did
*NL*
not
adopt
this
course
of
treatment
immediately
.
She
at
first
lacked
the
*NL*
depravity
indispensable
to
shutting
me
up
in
mental
darkness
.
It
was
*NL*
at
least
necessary
for
her
to
have
some
training
in
the
exercise
of
*NL*
irresponsible
power
,
to
make
her
equal
to
the
task
of
treating
me
as
*NL*
though
I
were
a
brute
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
mistress
was
,
as
I
have
said
,
a
kind
and
tender-hearted
woman
;
and
in
*NL*
the
simplicity
of
her
soul
she
commenced
,
when
I
first
went
to
live
with
*NL*
her
,
to
treat
me
as
she
supposed
one
human
being
ought
to
treat
another
.
*NL*
In
entering
upon
the
duties
of
a
slaveholder
,
she
did
not
seem
to
*NL*
perceive
that
I
sustained
to
her
the
relation
of
a
mere
chattel
,
and
*NL*
that
for
her
to
treat
me
as
a
human
being
was
not
only
wrong
,
but
*NL*
dangerously
so
.
Slavery
proved
as
injurious
to
her
as
it
did
to
me
.
When
*NL*
I
went
there
,
she
was
a
pious
,
warm
,
and
tender-hearted
woman
.
There
was
*NL*
no
sorrow
or
suffering
for
which
she
had
not
a
tear
.
She
had
bread
for
*NL*
the
hungry
,
clothes
for
the
naked
,
and
comfort
for
every
mourner
that
*NL*
came
within
her
reach
.
Slavery
soon
proved
its
ability
to
divest
her
of
*NL*
these
heavenly
qualities
.
Under
its
influence
,
the
tender
heart
became
*NL*
stone
,
and
the
lamblike
disposition
gave
way
to
one
of
tiger-like
*NL*
fierceness
.
The
first
step
in
her
downward
course
was
in
her
ceasing
to
*NL*
instruct
me
.
She
now
commenced
to
practise
her
husband
's
precepts
.
She
*NL*
finally
became
even
more
violent
in
her
opposition
than
her
husband
*NL*
himself
.
She
was
not
satisfied
with
simply
doing
as
well
as
he
had
*NL*
commanded
;
she
seemed
anxious
to
do
better
.
Nothing
seemed
to
make
her
*NL*
more
angry
than
to
see
me
with
a
newspaper
.
She
seemed
to
think
that
*NL*
here
lay
the
danger
.
I
have
had
her
rush
at
me
with
a
face
made
all
up
*NL*
of
fury
,
and
snatch
from
me
a
newspaper
,
in
a
manner
that
fully
revealed
*NL*
her
apprehension
.
She
was
an
apt
woman
;
and
a
little
experience
soon
*NL*
demonstrated
,
to
her
satisfaction
,
that
education
and
slavery
were
*NL*
incompatible
with
each
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
this
time
I
was
most
narrowly
watched
.
If
I
was
in
a
separate
room
*NL*
any
considerable
length
of
time
,
I
was
sure
to
be
suspected
of
having
*NL*
a
book
,
and
was
at
once
called
to
give
an
account
of
myself
.
All
this
,
*NL*
however
,
was
too
late
.
The
first
step
had
been
taken
.
Mistress
,
in
*NL*
teaching
me
the
alphabet
,
had
given
me
the
_
inch
,
_
and
no
precaution
*NL*
could
prevent
me
from
taking
the
_
ell
.
_
*NL*
*NL*
The
plan
which
I
adopted
,
and
the
one
by
which
I
was
most
successful
,
*NL*
was
that
of
making
friends
of
all
the
little
white
boys
whom
I
met
in
*NL*
the
street
.
As
many
of
these
as
I
could
,
I
converted
into
teachers
.
With
*NL*
their
kindly
aid
,
obtained
at
different
times
and
in
different
places
,
*NL*
I
finally
succeeded
in
learning
to
read
.
When
I
was
sent
of
errands
,
I
*NL*
always
took
my
book
with
me
,
and
by
going
one
part
of
my
errand
quickly
,
*NL*
I
found
time
to
get
a
lesson
before
my
return
.
I
used
also
to
carry
*NL*
bread
with
me
,
enough
of
which
was
always
in
the
house
,
and
to
which
I
*NL*
was
always
welcome
;
for
I
was
much
better
off
in
this
regard
than
many
*NL*
of
the
poor
white
children
in
our
neighborhood
.
This
bread
I
used
to
*NL*
bestow
upon
the
hungry
little
urchins
,
who
,
in
return
,
would
give
me
*NL*
that
more
valuable
bread
of
knowledge
.
I
am
strongly
tempted
to
give
*NL*
the
names
of
two
or
three
of
those
little
boys
,
as
a
testimonial
of
the
*NL*
gratitude
and
affection
I
bear
them
;
but
prudence
forbids
;
--
not
that
*NL*
it
would
injure
me
,
but
it
might
embarrass
them
;
for
it
is
almost
an
*NL*
unpardonable
offence
to
teach
slaves
to
read
in
this
Christian
country
.
*NL*
It
is
enough
to
say
of
the
dear
little
fellows
,
that
they
lived
on
*NL*
Philpot
Street
,
very
near
Durgin
and
Bailey
's
ship-yard
.
I
used
to
talk
*NL*
this
matter
of
slavery
over
with
them
.
I
would
sometimes
say
to
them
,
I
*NL*
wished
I
could
be
as
free
as
they
would
be
when
they
got
to
be
men
.
``
You
*NL*
will
be
free
as
soon
as
you
are
twenty-one
,
_
but
I
am
a
slave
for
life
!
_
*NL*
Have
not
I
as
good
a
right
to
be
free
as
you
have
?
''
These
words
used
*NL*
to
trouble
them
;
they
would
express
for
me
the
liveliest
sympathy
,
and
*NL*
console
me
with
the
hope
that
something
would
occur
by
which
I
might
be
*NL*
free
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
now
about
twelve
years
old
,
and
the
thought
of
being
_
a
slave
for
*NL*
life
_
began
to
bear
heavily
upon
my
heart
.
Just
about
this
time
,
I
got
*NL*
hold
of
a
book
entitled
``
The
Columbian
Orator
.
''
Every
opportunity
I
*NL*
got
,
I
used
to
read
this
book
.
Among
much
of
other
interesting
matter
,
*NL*
I
found
in
it
a
dialogue
between
a
master
and
his
slave
.
The
slave
was
*NL*
represented
as
having
run
away
from
his
master
three
times
.
The
dialogue
*NL*
represented
the
conversation
which
took
place
between
them
,
when
the
*NL*
slave
was
retaken
the
third
time
.
In
this
dialogue
,
the
whole
argument
*NL*
in
behalf
of
slavery
was
brought
forward
by
the
master
,
all
of
which
was
*NL*
disposed
of
by
the
slave
.
The
slave
was
made
to
say
some
very
smart
as
*NL*
well
as
impressive
things
in
reply
to
his
master
--
things
which
had
the
*NL*
desired
though
unexpected
effect
;
for
the
conversation
resulted
in
the
*NL*
voluntary
emancipation
of
the
slave
on
the
part
of
the
master
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
same
book
,
I
met
with
one
of
Sheridan
's
mighty
speeches
on
and
*NL*
in
behalf
of
Catholic
emancipation
.
These
were
choice
documents
to
me
.
*NL*
I
read
them
over
and
over
again
with
unabated
interest
.
They
gave
tongue
*NL*
to
interesting
thoughts
of
my
own
soul
,
which
had
frequently
flashed
*NL*
through
my
mind
,
and
died
away
for
want
of
utterance
.
The
moral
which
I
*NL*
gained
from
the
dialogue
was
the
power
of
truth
over
the
conscience
of
*NL*
even
a
slaveholder
.
What
I
got
from
Sheridan
was
a
bold
denunciation
*NL*
of
slavery
,
and
a
powerful
vindication
of
human
rights
.
The
reading
*NL*
of
these
documents
enabled
me
to
utter
my
thoughts
,
and
to
meet
the
*NL*
arguments
brought
forward
to
sustain
slavery
;
but
while
they
relieved
*NL*
me
of
one
difficulty
,
they
brought
on
another
even
more
painful
than
*NL*
the
one
of
which
I
was
relieved
.
The
more
I
read
,
the
more
I
was
led
*NL*
to
abhor
and
detest
my
enslavers
.
I
could
regard
them
in
no
other
light
*NL*
than
a
band
of
successful
robbers
,
who
had
left
their
homes
,
and
gone
to
*NL*
Africa
,
and
stolen
us
from
our
homes
,
and
in
a
strange
land
reduced
*NL*
us
to
slavery
.
I
loathed
them
as
being
the
meanest
as
well
as
the
most
*NL*
wicked
of
men
.
As
I
read
and
contemplated
the
subject
,
behold
!
that
very
*NL*
discontentment
which
Master
Hugh
had
predicted
would
follow
my
learning
*NL*
to
read
had
already
come
,
to
torment
and
sting
my
soul
to
unutterable
*NL*
anguish
.
As
I
writhed
under
it
,
I
would
at
times
feel
that
learning
to
*NL*
read
had
been
a
curse
rather
than
a
blessing
.
It
had
given
me
a
view
*NL*
of
my
wretched
condition
,
without
the
remedy
.
It
opened
my
eyes
to
the
*NL*
horrible
pit
,
but
to
no
ladder
upon
which
to
get
out
.
In
moments
of
*NL*
agony
,
I
envied
my
fellow-slaves
for
their
stupidity
.
I
have
often
*NL*
wished
myself
a
beast
.
I
preferred
the
condition
of
the
meanest
reptile
*NL*
to
my
own
.
Any
thing
,
no
matter
what
,
to
get
rid
of
thinking
!
It
was
*NL*
this
everlasting
thinking
of
my
condition
that
tormented
me
.
There
was
*NL*
no
getting
rid
of
it
.
It
was
pressed
upon
me
by
every
object
within
*NL*
sight
or
hearing
,
animate
or
inanimate
.
The
silver
trump
of
freedom
*NL*
had
roused
my
soul
to
eternal
wakefulness
.
Freedom
now
appeared
,
to
*NL*
disappear
no
more
forever
.
It
was
heard
in
every
sound
,
and
seen
in
*NL*
every
thing
.
It
was
ever
present
to
torment
me
with
a
sense
of
my
*NL*
wretched
condition
.
I
saw
nothing
without
seeing
it
,
I
heard
nothing
*NL*
without
hearing
it
,
and
felt
nothing
without
feeling
it
.
It
looked
from
*NL*
every
star
,
it
smiled
in
every
calm
,
breathed
in
every
wind
,
and
moved
*NL*
in
every
storm
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
often
found
myself
regretting
my
own
existence
,
and
wishing
myself
*NL*
dead
;
and
but
for
the
hope
of
being
free
,
I
have
no
doubt
but
that
I
*NL*
should
have
killed
myself
,
or
done
something
for
which
I
should
have
*NL*
been
killed
.
While
in
this
state
of
mind
,
I
was
eager
to
hear
any
one
*NL*
speak
of
slavery
.
I
was
a
ready
listener
.
Every
little
while
,
I
could
*NL*
hear
something
about
the
abolitionists
.
It
was
some
time
before
I
found
*NL*
what
the
word
meant
.
It
was
always
used
in
such
connections
as
to
make
*NL*
it
an
interesting
word
to
me
.
If
a
slave
ran
away
and
succeeded
in
*NL*
getting
clear
,
or
if
a
slave
killed
his
master
,
set
fire
to
a
barn
,
or
*NL*
did
any
thing
very
wrong
in
the
mind
of
a
slaveholder
,
it
was
spoken
of
*NL*
as
the
fruit
of
_
abolition
.
_
Hearing
the
word
in
this
connection
very
*NL*
often
,
I
set
about
learning
what
it
meant
.
The
dictionary
afforded
me
*NL*
little
or
no
help
.
I
found
it
was
``
the
act
of
abolishing
;
''
but
then
I
*NL*
did
not
know
what
was
to
be
abolished
.
Here
I
was
perplexed
.
I
did
not
*NL*
dare
to
ask
any
one
about
its
meaning
,
for
I
was
satisfied
that
it
was
*NL*
something
they
wanted
me
to
know
very
little
about
.
After
a
patient
*NL*
waiting
,
I
got
one
of
our
city
papers
,
containing
an
account
of
the
*NL*
number
of
petitions
from
the
north
,
praying
for
the
abolition
of
slavery
*NL*
in
the
District
of
Columbia
,
and
of
the
slave
trade
between
the
States
.
*NL*
From
this
time
I
understood
the
words
_
abolition
_
and
_
abolitionist
,
_
*NL*
and
always
drew
near
when
that
word
was
spoken
,
expecting
to
hear
*NL*
something
of
importance
to
myself
and
fellow-slaves
.
The
light
broke
in
*NL*
upon
me
by
degrees
.
I
went
one
day
down
on
the
wharf
of
Mr.
Waters
;
*NL*
and
seeing
two
Irishmen
unloading
a
scow
of
stone
,
I
went
,
unasked
,
and
*NL*
helped
them
.
When
we
had
finished
,
one
of
them
came
to
me
and
asked
*NL*
me
if
I
were
a
slave
.
I
told
him
I
was
.
He
asked
,
``
Are
ye
a
slave
for
*NL*
life
?
''
I
told
him
that
I
was
.
The
good
Irishman
seemed
to
be
deeply
*NL*
affected
by
the
statement
.
He
said
to
the
other
that
it
was
a
pity
so
*NL*
fine
a
little
fellow
as
myself
should
be
a
slave
for
life
.
He
said
it
*NL*
was
a
shame
to
hold
me
.
They
both
advised
me
to
run
away
to
the
north
;
*NL*
that
I
should
find
friends
there
,
and
that
I
should
be
free
.
I
pretended
*NL*
not
to
be
interested
in
what
they
said
,
and
treated
them
as
if
I
did
not
*NL*
understand
them
;
for
I
feared
they
might
be
treacherous
.
White
men
have
*NL*
been
known
to
encourage
slaves
to
escape
,
and
then
,
to
get
the
reward
,
*NL*
catch
them
and
return
them
to
their
masters
.
I
was
afraid
that
these
*NL*
seemingly
good
men
might
use
me
so
;
but
I
nevertheless
remembered
their
*NL*
advice
,
and
from
that
time
I
resolved
to
run
away
.
I
looked
forward
to
*NL*
a
time
at
which
it
would
be
safe
for
me
to
escape
.
I
was
too
young
to
*NL*
think
of
doing
so
immediately
;
besides
,
I
wished
to
learn
how
to
write
,
*NL*
as
I
might
have
occasion
to
write
my
own
pass
.
I
consoled
myself
with
*NL*
the
hope
that
I
should
one
day
find
a
good
chance
.
Meanwhile
,
I
would
*NL*
learn
to
write
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
idea
as
to
how
I
might
learn
to
write
was
suggested
to
me
by
*NL*
being
in
Durgin
and
Bailey
's
ship-yard
,
and
frequently
seeing
the
ship
*NL*
carpenters
,
after
hewing
,
and
getting
a
piece
of
timber
ready
for
use
,
*NL*
write
on
the
timber
the
name
of
that
part
of
the
ship
for
which
it
was
*NL*
intended
.
When
a
piece
of
timber
was
intended
for
the
larboard
side
,
it
*NL*
would
be
marked
thus
--
``
L.
''
When
a
piece
was
for
the
starboard
side
,
it
*NL*
would
be
marked
thus
--
``
S.
''
A
piece
for
the
larboard
side
forward
,
would
*NL*
be
marked
thus
--
``
L.
F.
''
When
a
piece
was
for
starboard
side
forward
,
*NL*
it
would
be
marked
thus
--
``
S.
F.
''
For
larboard
aft
,
it
would
be
marked
*NL*
thus
--
``
L.
A.
''
For
starboard
aft
,
it
would
be
marked
thus
--
``
S.
A.
''
I
soon
*NL*
learned
the
names
of
these
letters
,
and
for
what
they
were
intended
when
*NL*
placed
upon
a
piece
of
timber
in
the
ship-yard
.
I
immediately
commenced
*NL*
copying
them
,
and
in
a
short
time
was
able
to
make
the
four
letters
*NL*
named
.
After
that
,
when
I
met
with
any
boy
who
I
knew
could
write
,
I
*NL*
would
tell
him
I
could
write
as
well
as
he
.
The
next
word
would
be
,
``
I
*NL*
do
n't
believe
you
.
Let
me
see
you
try
it
.
''
I
would
then
make
the
letters
*NL*
which
I
had
been
so
fortunate
as
to
learn
,
and
ask
him
to
beat
that
.
*NL*
In
this
way
I
got
a
good
many
lessons
in
writing
,
which
it
is
quite
*NL*
possible
I
should
never
have
gotten
in
any
other
way
.
During
this
time
,
*NL*
my
copy-book
was
the
board
fence
,
brick
wall
,
and
pavement
;
my
pen
and
*NL*
ink
was
a
lump
of
chalk
.
With
these
,
I
learned
mainly
how
to
write
.
I
*NL*
then
commenced
and
continued
copying
the
Italics
in
Webster
's
Spelling
*NL*
Book
,
until
I
could
make
them
all
without
looking
on
the
book
.
By
this
*NL*
time
,
my
little
Master
Thomas
had
gone
to
school
,
and
learned
how
to
*NL*
write
,
and
had
written
over
a
number
of
copy-books
.
These
had
been
*NL*
brought
home
,
and
shown
to
some
of
our
near
neighbors
,
and
then
laid
*NL*
aside
.
My
mistress
used
to
go
to
class
meeting
at
the
Wilk
Street
*NL*
meetinghouse
every
Monday
afternoon
,
and
leave
me
to
take
care
of
the
*NL*
house
.
When
left
thus
,
I
used
to
spend
the
time
in
writing
in
the
*NL*
spaces
left
in
Master
Thomas
's
copy-book
,
copying
what
he
had
written
.
I
*NL*
continued
to
do
this
until
I
could
write
a
hand
very
similar
to
that
of
*NL*
Master
Thomas
.
Thus
,
after
a
long
,
tedious
effort
for
years
,
I
finally
*NL*
succeeded
in
learning
how
to
write
.

CHAPTER
VIII
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
very
short
time
after
I
went
to
live
at
Baltimore
,
my
old
master
's
*NL*
youngest
son
Richard
died
;
and
in
about
three
years
and
six
months
after
*NL*
his
death
,
my
old
master
,
Captain
Anthony
,
died
,
leaving
only
his
son
,
*NL*
Andrew
,
and
daughter
,
Lucretia
,
to
share
his
estate
.
He
died
while
on
a
*NL*
visit
to
see
his
daughter
at
Hillsborough
.
Cut
off
thus
unexpectedly
,
*NL*
he
left
no
will
as
to
the
disposal
of
his
property
.
It
was
therefore
*NL*
necessary
to
have
a
valuation
of
the
property
,
that
it
might
be
equally
*NL*
divided
between
Mrs.
Lucretia
and
Master
Andrew
.
I
was
immediately
sent
*NL*
for
,
to
be
valued
with
the
other
property
.
Here
again
my
feelings
rose
*NL*
up
in
detestation
of
slavery
.
I
had
now
a
new
conception
of
my
degraded
*NL*
condition
.
Prior
to
this
,
I
had
become
,
if
not
insensible
to
my
lot
,
*NL*
at
least
partly
so
.
I
left
Baltimore
with
a
young
heart
overborne
with
*NL*
sadness
,
and
a
soul
full
of
apprehension
.
I
took
passage
with
Captain
*NL*
Rowe
,
in
the
schooner
Wild
Cat
,
and
,
after
a
sail
of
about
twenty-four
*NL*
hours
,
I
found
myself
near
the
place
of
my
birth
.
I
had
now
been
absent
*NL*
from
it
almost
,
if
not
quite
,
five
years
.
I
,
however
,
remembered
the
*NL*
place
very
well
.
I
was
only
about
five
years
old
when
I
left
it
,
to
go
*NL*
and
live
with
my
old
master
on
Colonel
Lloyd
's
plantation
;
so
that
I
was
*NL*
now
between
ten
and
eleven
years
old
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
were
all
ranked
together
at
the
valuation
.
Men
and
women
,
old
and
*NL*
young
,
married
and
single
,
were
ranked
with
horses
,
sheep
,
and
swine
.
*NL*
There
were
horses
and
men
,
cattle
and
women
,
pigs
and
children
,
all
*NL*
holding
the
same
rank
in
the
scale
of
being
,
and
were
all
subjected
to
*NL*
the
same
narrow
examination
.
Silvery-headed
age
and
sprightly
youth
,
*NL*
maids
and
matrons
,
had
to
undergo
the
same
indelicate
inspection
.
At
*NL*
this
moment
,
I
saw
more
clearly
than
ever
the
brutalizing
effects
of
*NL*
slavery
upon
both
slave
and
slaveholder
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
valuation
,
then
came
the
division
.
I
have
no
language
to
*NL*
express
the
high
excitement
and
deep
anxiety
which
were
felt
among
us
*NL*
poor
slaves
during
this
time
.
Our
fate
for
life
was
now
to
be
decided
.
*NL*
we
had
no
more
voice
in
that
decision
than
the
brutes
among
whom
we
*NL*
were
ranked
.
A
single
word
from
the
white
men
was
enough
--
against
all
our
*NL*
wishes
,
prayers
,
and
entreaties
--
to
sunder
forever
the
dearest
friends
,
*NL*
dearest
kindred
,
and
strongest
ties
known
to
human
beings
.
In
addition
*NL*
to
the
pain
of
separation
,
there
was
the
horrid
dread
of
falling
into
*NL*
the
hands
of
Master
Andrew
.
He
was
known
to
us
all
as
being
a
most
cruel
*NL*
wretch
,
--
a
common
drunkard
,
who
had
,
by
his
reckless
mismanagement
and
*NL*
profligate
dissipation
,
already
wasted
a
large
portion
of
his
father
's
*NL*
property
.
We
all
felt
that
we
might
as
well
be
sold
at
once
to
the
*NL*
Georgia
traders
,
as
to
pass
into
his
hands
;
for
we
knew
that
that
would
*NL*
be
our
inevitable
condition
,
--
a
condition
held
by
us
all
in
the
utmost
*NL*
horror
and
dread
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
suffered
more
anxiety
than
most
of
my
fellow-slaves
.
I
had
known
what
*NL*
it
was
to
be
kindly
treated
;
they
had
known
nothing
of
the
kind
.
They
*NL*
had
seen
little
or
nothing
of
the
world
.
They
were
in
very
deed
men
and
*NL*
women
of
sorrow
,
and
acquainted
with
grief
.
Their
backs
had
been
made
*NL*
familiar
with
the
bloody
lash
,
so
that
they
had
become
callous
;
mine
was
*NL*
yet
tender
;
for
while
at
Baltimore
I
got
few
whippings
,
and
few
slaves
*NL*
could
boast
of
a
kinder
master
and
mistress
than
myself
;
and
the
thought
*NL*
of
passing
out
of
their
hands
into
those
of
Master
Andrew
--
a
man
who
,
but
*NL*
a
few
days
before
,
to
give
me
a
sample
of
his
bloody
disposition
,
took
*NL*
my
little
brother
by
the
throat
,
threw
him
on
the
ground
,
and
with
the
*NL*
heel
of
his
boot
stamped
upon
his
head
till
the
blood
gushed
from
his
*NL*
nose
and
ears
--
was
well
calculated
to
make
me
anxious
as
to
my
fate
.
*NL*
After
he
had
committed
this
savage
outrage
upon
my
brother
,
he
turned
*NL*
to
me
,
and
said
that
was
the
way
he
meant
to
serve
me
one
of
these
*NL*
days
,
--
meaning
,
I
suppose
,
when
I
came
into
his
possession
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thanks
to
a
kind
Providence
,
I
fell
to
the
portion
of
Mrs.
Lucretia
,
and
*NL*
was
sent
immediately
back
to
Baltimore
,
to
live
again
in
the
family
*NL*
of
Master
Hugh
.
Their
joy
at
my
return
equalled
their
sorrow
at
my
*NL*
departure
.
It
was
a
glad
day
to
me
.
I
had
escaped
a
worse
than
lion
's
*NL*
jaws
.
I
was
absent
from
Baltimore
,
for
the
purpose
of
valuation
and
*NL*
division
,
just
about
one
month
,
and
it
seemed
to
have
been
six
.
*NL*
*NL*
Very
soon
after
my
return
to
Baltimore
,
my
mistress
,
Lucretia
,
died
,
*NL*
leaving
her
husband
and
one
child
,
Amanda
;
and
in
a
very
short
time
*NL*
after
her
death
,
Master
Andrew
died
.
Now
all
the
property
of
my
old
*NL*
master
,
slaves
included
,
was
in
the
hands
of
strangers
,
--
strangers
who
*NL*
had
had
nothing
to
do
with
accumulating
it
.
Not
a
slave
was
left
free
.
*NL*
All
remained
slaves
,
from
the
youngest
to
the
oldest
.
If
any
one
thing
*NL*
in
my
experience
,
more
than
another
,
served
to
deepen
my
conviction
*NL*
of
the
infernal
character
of
slavery
,
and
to
fill
me
with
unutterable
*NL*
loathing
of
slaveholders
,
it
was
their
base
ingratitude
to
my
poor
old
*NL*
grandmother
.
She
had
served
my
old
master
faithfully
from
youth
to
old
*NL*
age
.
She
had
been
the
source
of
all
his
wealth
;
she
had
peopled
his
*NL*
plantation
with
slaves
;
she
had
become
a
great
grandmother
in
his
*NL*
service
.
She
had
rocked
him
in
infancy
,
attended
him
in
childhood
,
*NL*
served
him
through
life
,
and
at
his
death
wiped
from
his
icy
brow
the
*NL*
cold
death-sweat
,
and
closed
his
eyes
forever
.
She
was
nevertheless
left
*NL*
a
slave
--
a
slave
for
life
--
a
slave
in
the
hands
of
strangers
;
and
in
*NL*
their
hands
she
saw
her
children
,
her
grandchildren
,
and
her
*NL*
great-grandchildren
,
divided
,
like
so
many
sheep
,
without
being
*NL*
gratified
with
the
small
privilege
of
a
single
word
,
as
to
their
or
*NL*
her
own
destiny
.
And
,
to
cap
the
climax
of
their
base
ingratitude
*NL*
and
fiendish
barbarity
,
my
grandmother
,
who
was
now
very
old
,
having
*NL*
outlived
my
old
master
and
all
his
children
,
having
seen
the
beginning
*NL*
and
end
of
all
of
them
,
and
her
present
owners
finding
she
was
of
but
*NL*
little
value
,
her
frame
already
racked
with
the
pains
of
old
age
,
and
*NL*
complete
helplessness
fast
stealing
over
her
once
active
limbs
,
*NL*
they
took
her
to
the
woods
,
built
her
a
little
hut
,
put
up
a
little
*NL*
mud-chimney
,
and
then
made
her
welcome
to
the
privilege
of
supporting
*NL*
herself
there
in
perfect
loneliness
;
thus
virtually
turning
her
out
to
*NL*
die
!
If
my
poor
old
grandmother
now
lives
,
she
lives
to
suffer
in
utter
*NL*
loneliness
;
she
lives
to
remember
and
mourn
over
the
loss
of
children
,
*NL*
the
loss
of
grandchildren
,
and
the
loss
of
great-grandchildren
.
They
*NL*
are
,
in
the
language
of
the
slave
's
poet
,
Whittier
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gone
,
gone
,
sold
and

ceaseless
swings

noisome

*NL*
*NL*
The
hearth
is
desolate
.
The
children
,
the
unconscious
children
,
who
once
*NL*
sang
and
danced
in
her
presence
,
are
gone
.
She
gropes
her
way
,
in
the
*NL*
darkness
of
age
,
for
a
drink
of
water
.
Instead
of
the
voices
of
her
*NL*
children
,
she
hears
by
day
the
moans
of
the
dove
,
and
by
night
the
*NL*
screams
of
the
hideous
owl
.
All
is
gloom
.
The
grave
is
at
the
door
.
And
*NL*
now
,
when
weighed
down
by
the
pains
and
aches
of
old
age
,
when
the
head
*NL*
inclines
to
the
feet
,
when
the
beginning
and
ending
of
human
existence
*NL*
meet
,
and
helpless
infancy
and
painful
old
age
combine
together
--
at
*NL*
this
time
,
this
most
needful
time
,
the
time
for
the
exercise
of
that
*NL*
tenderness
and
affection
which
children
only
can
exercise
towards
a
*NL*
declining
parent
--
my
poor
old
grandmother
,
the
devoted
mother
of
twelve
*NL*
children
,
is
left
all
alone
,
in
yonder
little
hut
,
before
a
few
dim
*NL*
embers
.
She
stands
--
she
sits
--
she
staggers
--
she
falls
--
she
groans
--
she
*NL*
dies
--
and
there
are
none
of
her
children
or
grandchildren
present
,
to
*NL*
wipe
from
her
wrinkled
brow
the
cold
sweat
of
death
,
or
to
place
beneath
*NL*
the
sod
her
fallen
remains
.
Will
not
a
righteous
God
visit
for
these
*NL*
things
?
*NL*
*NL*
In
about
two
years
after
the
death
of
Mrs.
Lucretia
,
Master
Thomas
*NL*
married
his
second
wife
.
Her
name
was
Rowena
Hamilton
.
She
was
the
*NL*
eldest
daughter
of
Mr.
William
Hamilton
.
Master
now
lived
in
St.
*NL*
Michael
's
.
Not
long
after
his
marriage
,
a
misunderstanding
took
place
*NL*
between
himself
and
Master
Hugh
;
and
as
a
means
of
punishing
his
*NL*
brother
,
he
took
me
from
him
to
live
with
himself
at
St.
Michael
's
.
Here
*NL*
I
underwent
another
most
painful
separation
.
It
,
however
,
was
not
so
*NL*
severe
as
the
one
I
dreaded
at
the
division
of
property
;
for
,
during
*NL*
this
interval
,
a
great
change
had
taken
place
in
Master
Hugh
and
his
*NL*
once
kind
and
affectionate
wife
.
The
influence
of
brandy
upon
him
,
and
*NL*
of
slavery
upon
her
,
had
effected
a
disastrous
change
in
the
characters
*NL*
of
both
;
so
that
,
as
far
as
they
were
concerned
,
I
thought
I
had
little
*NL*
to
lose
by
the
change
.
But
it
was
not
to
them
that
I
was
attached
.
It
*NL*
was
to
those
little
Baltimore
boys
that
I
felt
the
strongest
attachment
.
*NL*
I
had
received
many
good
lessons
from
them
,
and
was
still
receiving
*NL*
them
,
and
the
thought
of
leaving
them
was
painful
indeed
.
I
was
leaving
,
*NL*
too
,
without
the
hope
of
ever
being
allowed
to
return
.
Master
Thomas
had
*NL*
said
he
would
never
let
me
return
again
.
The
barrier
betwixt
himself
and
*NL*
brother
he
considered
impassable
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
then
had
to
regret
that
I
did
not
at
least
make
the
attempt
to
carry
*NL*
out
my
resolution
to
run
away
;
for
the
chances
of
success
are
tenfold
*NL*
greater
from
the
city
than
from
the
country
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
sailed
from
Baltimore
for
St.
Michael
's
in
the
sloop
Amanda
,
Captain
*NL*
Edward
Dodson
.
On
my
passage
,
I
paid
particular
attention
to
the
*NL*
direction
which
the
steamboats
took
to
go
to
Philadelphia
.
I
found
,
*NL*
instead
of
going
down
,
on
reaching
North
Point
they
went
up
the
bay
,
*NL*
in
a
north-easterly
direction
.
I
deemed
this
knowledge
of
the
utmost
*NL*
importance
.
My
determination
to
run
away
was
again
revived
.
I
resolved
*NL*
to
wait
only
so
long
as
the
offering
of
a
favorable
opportunity
.
When
*NL*
that
came
,
I
was
determined
to
be
off
.

CHAPTER
IX
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
now
reached
a
period
of
my
life
when
I
can
give
dates
.
I
left
*NL*
Baltimore
,
and
went
to
live
with
Master
Thomas
Auld
,
at
St.
Michael
's
,
*NL*
in
March
,
1832
.
It
was
now
more
than
seven
years
since
I
lived
with
him
*NL*
in
the
family
of
my
old
master
,
on
Colonel
Lloyd
's
plantation
.
We
of
*NL*
course
were
now
almost
entire
strangers
to
each
other
.
He
was
to
me
a
*NL*
new
master
,
and
I
to
him
a
new
slave
.
I
was
ignorant
of
his
temper
and
*NL*
disposition
;
he
was
equally
so
of
mine
.
A
very
short
time
,
however
,
*NL*
brought
us
into
full
acquaintance
with
each
other
.
I
was
made
acquainted
*NL*
with
his
wife
not
less
than
with
himself
.
They
were
well
matched
,
being
*NL*
equally
mean
and
cruel
.
I
was
now
,
for
the
first
time
during
a
space
*NL*
of
more
than
seven
years
,
made
to
feel
the
painful
gnawings
of
hunger
--
a
*NL*
something
which
I
had
not
experienced
before
since
I
left
Colonel
*NL*
Lloyd
's
plantation
.
It
went
hard
enough
with
me
then
,
when
I
could
look
*NL*
back
to
no
period
at
which
I
had
enjoyed
a
sufficiency
.
It
was
tenfold
*NL*
harder
after
living
in
Master
Hugh
's
family
,
where
I
had
always
had
*NL*
enough
to
eat
,
and
of
that
which
was
good
.
I
have
said
Master
Thomas
was
*NL*
a
mean
man
.
He
was
so
.
Not
to
give
a
slave
enough
to
eat
,
is
regarded
as
*NL*
the
most
aggravated
development
of
meanness
even
among
slaveholders
.
The
*NL*
rule
is
,
no
matter
how
coarse
the
food
,
only
let
there
be
enough
of
it
.
*NL*
This
is
the
theory
;
and
in
the
part
of
Maryland
from
which
I
came
,
it
*NL*
is
the
general
practice
,
--
though
there
are
many
exceptions
.
Master
Thomas
*NL*
gave
us
enough
of
neither
coarse
nor
fine
food
.
There
were
four
slaves
*NL*
of
us
in
the
kitchen
--
my
sister
Eliza
,
my
aunt
Priscilla
,
Henny
,
and
*NL*
myself
;
and
we
were
allowed
less
than
a
half
of
a
bushel
of
corn-meal
*NL*
per
week
,
and
very
little
else
,
either
in
the
shape
of
meat
or
*NL*
vegetables
.
It
was
not
enough
for
us
to
subsist
upon
.
We
were
therefore
*NL*
reduced
to
the
wretched
necessity
of
living
at
the
expense
of
our
*NL*
neighbors
.
This
we
did
by
begging
and
stealing
,
whichever
came
handy
in
*NL*
the
time
of
need
,
the
one
being
considered
as
legitimate
as
the
other
.
*NL*
A
great
many
times
have
we
poor
creatures
been
nearly
perishing
*NL*
with
hunger
,
when
food
in
abundance
lay
mouldering
in
the
safe
and
*NL*
smoke-house
,
and
our
pious
mistress
was
aware
of
the
fact
;
and
yet
that
*NL*
mistress
and
her
husband
would
kneel
every
morning
,
and
pray
that
God
*NL*
would
bless
them
in
basket
and
store
!
*NL*
*NL*
Bad
as
all
slaveholders
are
,
we
seldom
meet
one
destitute
of
every
*NL*
element
of
character
commanding
respect
.
My
master
was
one
of
this
rare
*NL*
sort
.
I
do
not
know
of
one
single
noble
act
ever
performed
by
him
.
The
*NL*
leading
trait
in
his
character
was
meanness
;
and
if
there
were
any
other
*NL*
element
in
his
nature
,
it
was
made
subject
to
this
.
He
was
mean
;
and
,
*NL*
like
most
other
mean
men
,
he
lacked
the
ability
to
conceal
his
meanness
.
*NL*
Captain
Auld
was
not
born
a
slaveholder
.
He
had
been
a
poor
man
,
master
*NL*
only
of
a
Bay
craft
.
He
came
into
possession
of
all
his
slaves
by
*NL*
marriage
;
and
of
all
men
,
adopted
slaveholders
are
the
worst
.
He
was
*NL*
cruel
,
but
cowardly
.
He
commanded
without
firmness
.
In
the
enforcement
*NL*
of
his
rules
,
he
was
at
times
rigid
,
and
at
times
lax
.
At
times
,
he
*NL*
spoke
to
his
slaves
with
the
firmness
of
Napoleon
and
the
fury
of
a
*NL*
demon
;
at
other
times
,
he
might
well
be
mistaken
for
an
inquirer
who
*NL*
had
lost
his
way
.
He
did
nothing
of
himself
.
He
might
have
passed
for
a
*NL*
lion
,
but
for
his
ears
.
In
all
things
noble
which
he
attempted
,
his
own
*NL*
meanness
shone
most
conspicuous
.
His
airs
,
words
,
and
actions
,
were
the
*NL*
airs
,
words
,
and
actions
of
born
slaveholders
,
and
,
being
assumed
,
were
*NL*
awkward
enough
.
He
was
not
even
a
good
imitator
.
He
possessed
all
the
*NL*
disposition
to
deceive
,
but
wanted
the
power
.
Having
no
resources
within
*NL*
himself
,
he
was
compelled
to
be
the
copyist
of
many
,
and
being
such
,
he
*NL*
was
forever
the
victim
of
inconsistency
;
and
of
consequence
he
was
an
*NL*
object
of
contempt
,
and
was
held
as
such
even
by
his
slaves
.
The
luxury
*NL*
of
having
slaves
of
his
own
to
wait
upon
him
was
something
new
and
*NL*
unprepared
for
.
He
was
a
slaveholder
without
the
ability
to
hold
slaves
.
*NL*
He
found
himself
incapable
of
managing
his
slaves
either
by
force
,
*NL*
fear
,
or
fraud
.
We
seldom
called
him
``
master
;
''
we
generally
called
him
*NL*
``
Captain
Auld
,
''
and
were
hardly
disposed
to
title
him
at
all
.
I
doubt
*NL*
not
that
our
conduct
had
much
to
do
with
making
him
appear
awkward
,
*NL*
and
of
consequence
fretful
.
Our
want
of
reverence
for
him
must
have
*NL*
perplexed
him
greatly
.
He
wished
to
have
us
call
him
master
,
but
lacked
*NL*
the
firmness
necessary
to
command
us
to
do
so
.
His
wife
used
to
insist
*NL*
upon
our
calling
him
so
,
but
to
no
purpose
.
In
August
,
1832
,
my
master
*NL*
attended
a
Methodist
camp-meeting
held
in
the
Bay-side
,
Talbot
county
,
*NL*
and
there
experienced
religion
.
I
indulged
a
faint
hope
that
his
*NL*
conversion
would
lead
him
to
emancipate
his
slaves
,
and
that
,
if
he
did
*NL*
not
do
this
,
it
would
,
at
any
rate
,
make
him
more
kind
and
humane
.
I
was
*NL*
disappointed
in
both
these
respects
.
It
neither
made
him
to
be
humane
*NL*
to
his
slaves
,
nor
to
emancipate
them
.
If
it
had
any
effect
on
his
*NL*
character
,
it
made
him
more
cruel
and
hateful
in
all
his
ways
;
for
I
*NL*
believe
him
to
have
been
a
much
worse
man
after
his
conversion
than
*NL*
before
.
Prior
to
his
conversion
,
he
relied
upon
his
own
depravity
*NL*
to
shield
and
sustain
him
in
his
savage
barbarity
;
but
after
his
*NL*
conversion
,
he
found
religious
sanction
and
support
for
his
slaveholding
*NL*
cruelty
.
He
made
the
greatest
pretensions
to
piety
.
His
house
was
*NL*
the
house
of
prayer
.
He
prayed
morning
,
noon
,
and
night
.
He
very
*NL*
soon
distinguished
himself
among
his
brethren
,
and
was
soon
made
a
*NL*
class-leader
and
exhorter
.
His
activity
in
revivals
was
great
,
and
he
*NL*
proved
himself
an
instrument
in
the
hands
of
the
church
in
converting
*NL*
many
souls
.
His
house
was
the
preachers
'
home
.
They
used
to
take
great
*NL*
pleasure
in
coming
there
to
put
up
;
for
while
he
starved
us
,
he
stuffed
*NL*
them
.
We
have
had
three
or
four
preachers
there
at
a
time
.
The
names
*NL*
of
those
who
used
to
come
most
frequently
while
I
lived
there
,
were
Mr.
*NL*
Storks
,
Mr.
Ewery
,
Mr.
Humphry
,
and
Mr.
Hickey
.
I
have
also
seen
Mr.
*NL*
George
Cookman
at
our
house
.
We
slaves
loved
Mr.
Cookman
.
We
believed
*NL*
him
to
be
a
good
man
.
We
thought
him
instrumental
in
getting
Mr.
Samuel
*NL*
Harrison
,
a
very
rich
slaveholder
,
to
emancipate
his
slaves
;
and
by
some
*NL*
means
got
the
impression
that
he
was
laboring
to
effect
the
emancipation
*NL*
of
all
the
slaves
.
When
he
was
at
our
house
,
we
were
sure
to
be
called
*NL*
in
to
prayers
.
When
the
others
were
there
,
we
were
sometimes
called
in
*NL*
and
sometimes
not
.
Mr.
Cookman
took
more
notice
of
us
than
either
of
*NL*
the
other
ministers
.
He
could
not
come
among
us
without
betraying
his
*NL*
sympathy
for
us
,
and
,
stupid
as
we
were
,
we
had
the
sagacity
to
see
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
I
lived
with
my
master
in
St.
Michael
's
,
there
was
a
white
*NL*
young
man
,
a
Mr.
Wilson
,
who
proposed
to
keep
a
Sabbath
school
for
the
*NL*
instruction
of
such
slaves
as
might
be
disposed
to
learn
to
read
the
New
*NL*
Testament
.
We
met
but
three
times
,
when
Mr.
West
and
Mr.
Fairbanks
,
*NL*
both
class-leaders
,
with
many
others
,
came
upon
us
with
sticks
and
other
*NL*
missiles
,
drove
us
off
,
and
forbade
us
to
meet
again
.
Thus
ended
our
*NL*
little
Sabbath
school
in
the
pious
town
of
St.
Michael
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
said
my
master
found
religious
sanction
for
his
cruelty
.
As
an
*NL*
example
,
I
will
state
one
of
many
facts
going
to
prove
the
charge
.
*NL*
I
have
seen
him
tie
up
a
lame
young
woman
,
and
whip
her
with
a
heavy
*NL*
cowskin
upon
her
naked
shoulders
,
causing
the
warm
red
blood
to
drip
;
*NL*
and
,
in
justification
of
the
bloody
deed
,
he
would
quote
this
passage
of
*NL*
Scripture
--
``
He
that
knoweth
his
master
's
will
,
and
doeth
it
not
,
shall
be
*NL*
beaten
with
many
stripes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Master
would
keep
this
lacerated
young
woman
tied
up
in
this
horrid
*NL*
situation
four
or
five
hours
at
a
time
.
I
have
known
him
to
tie
her
up
*NL*
early
in
the
morning
,
and
whip
her
before
breakfast
;
leave
her
,
go
to
*NL*
his
store
,
return
at
dinner
,
and
whip
her
again
,
cutting
her
in
the
*NL*
places
already
made
raw
with
his
cruel
lash
.
The
secret
of
master
's
*NL*
cruelty
toward
``
Henny
''
is
found
in
the
fact
of
her
being
almost
*NL*
helpless
.
When
quite
a
child
,
she
fell
into
the
fire
,
and
burned
herself
*NL*
horribly
.
Her
hands
were
so
burnt
that
she
never
got
the
use
of
them
.
*NL*
She
could
do
very
little
but
bear
heavy
burdens
.
She
was
to
master
a
*NL*
bill
of
expense
;
and
as
he
was
a
mean
man
,
she
was
a
constant
offence
*NL*
to
him
.
He
seemed
desirous
of
getting
the
poor
girl
out
of
existence
.
*NL*
He
gave
her
away
once
to
his
sister
;
but
,
being
a
poor
gift
,
she
was
*NL*
not
disposed
to
keep
her
.
Finally
,
my
benevolent
master
,
to
use
his
*NL*
own
words
,
``
set
her
adrift
to
take
care
of
herself
.
''
Here
was
a
*NL*
recently-converted
man
,
holding
on
upon
the
mother
,
and
at
the
same
time
*NL*
turning
out
her
helpless
child
,
to
starve
and
die
!
Master
Thomas
was
one
*NL*
of
the
many
pious
slaveholders
who
hold
slaves
for
the
very
charitable
*NL*
purpose
of
taking
care
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
master
and
myself
had
quite
a
number
of
differences
.
He
found
*NL*
me
unsuitable
to
his
purpose
.
My
city
life
,
he
said
,
had
had
a
very
*NL*
pernicious
effect
upon
me
.
It
had
almost
ruined
me
for
every
good
*NL*
purpose
,
and
fitted
me
for
every
thing
which
was
bad
.
One
of
my
greatest
*NL*
faults
was
that
of
letting
his
horse
run
away
,
and
go
down
to
his
*NL*
father-inlaw
's
farm
,
which
was
about
five
miles
from
St.
Michael
's
.
I
*NL*
would
then
have
to
go
after
it
.
My
reason
for
this
kind
of
carelessness
,
*NL*
or
carefulness
,
was
,
that
I
could
always
get
something
to
eat
when
I
*NL*
went
there
.
Master
William
Hamilton
,
my
master
's
father-in-law
,
always
*NL*
gave
his
slaves
enough
to
eat
.
I
never
left
there
hungry
,
no
matter
*NL*
how
great
the
need
of
my
speedy
return
.
Master
Thomas
at
length
said
he
*NL*
would
stand
it
no
longer
.
I
had
lived
with
him
nine
months
,
during
*NL*
which
time
he
had
given
me
a
number
of
severe
whippings
,
all
to
no
good
*NL*
purpose
.
He
resolved
to
put
me
out
,
as
he
said
,
to
be
broken
;
and
,
for
*NL*
this
purpose
,
he
let
me
for
one
year
to
a
man
named
Edward
Covey
.
Mr.
*NL*
Covey
was
a
poor
man
,
a
farm-renter
.
He
rented
the
place
upon
which
he
*NL*
lived
,
as
also
the
hands
with
which
he
tilled
it
.
Mr.
Covey
had
acquired
*NL*
a
very
high
reputation
for
breaking
young
slaves
,
and
this
reputation
*NL*
was
of
immense
value
to
him
.
It
enabled
him
to
get
his
farm
tilled
with
*NL*
much
less
expense
to
himself
than
he
could
have
had
it
done
without
such
*NL*
a
reputation
.
Some
slaveholders
thought
it
not
much
loss
to
allow
Mr.
*NL*
Covey
to
have
their
slaves
one
year
,
for
the
sake
of
the
training
to
*NL*
which
they
were
subjected
,
without
any
other
compensation
.
He
could
hire
*NL*
young
help
with
great
ease
,
in
consequence
of
this
reputation
.
Added
*NL*
to
the
natural
good
qualities
of
Mr.
Covey
,
he
was
a
professor
of
*NL*
religion
--
a
pious
soul
--
a
member
and
a
class-leader
in
the
*NL*
Methodist
church
.
All
of
this
added
weight
to
his
reputation
as
a
*NL*
``
nigger-breaker
.
''
I
was
aware
of
all
the
facts
,
having
been
made
*NL*
acquainted
with
them
by
a
young
man
who
had
lived
there
.
I
nevertheless
*NL*
made
the
change
gladly
;
for
I
was
sure
of
getting
enough
to
eat
,
which
*NL*
is
not
the
smallest
consideration
to
a
hungry
man
.

CHAPTER
X
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
left
Master
Thomas
's
house
,
and
went
to
live
with
Mr.
Covey
,
on
*NL*
the
1st
of
January
,
1833
.
I
was
now
,
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
,
a
*NL*
field
hand
.
In
my
new
employment
,
I
found
myself
even
more
awkward
than
*NL*
a
country
boy
appeared
to
be
in
a
large
city
.
I
had
been
at
my
new
home
*NL*
but
one
week
before
Mr.
Covey
gave
me
a
very
severe
whipping
,
cutting
my
*NL*
back
,
causing
the
blood
to
run
,
and
raising
ridges
on
my
flesh
as
large
*NL*
as
my
little
finger
.
The
details
of
this
affair
are
as
follows
:
Mr.
*NL*
Covey
sent
me
,
very
early
in
the
morning
of
one
of
our
coldest
days
in
*NL*
the
month
of
January
,
to
the
woods
,
to
get
a
load
of
wood
.
He
gave
me
*NL*
a
team
of
unbroken
oxen
.
He
told
me
which
was
the
in-hand
ox
,
and
which
*NL*
the
off-hand
one
.
He
then
tied
the
end
of
a
large
rope
around
the
horns
*NL*
of
the
in-hand
ox
,
and
gave
me
the
other
end
of
it
,
and
told
me
,
if
*NL*
the
oxen
started
to
run
,
that
I
must
hold
on
upon
the
rope
.
I
had
*NL*
never
driven
oxen
before
,
and
of
course
I
was
very
awkward
.
I
,
however
,
*NL*
succeeded
in
getting
to
the
edge
of
the
woods
with
little
difficulty
;
*NL*
but
I
had
got
a
very
few
rods
into
the
woods
,
when
the
oxen
took
fright
,
*NL*
and
started
full
tilt
,
carrying
the
cart
against
trees
,
and
over
stumps
,
*NL*
in
the
most
frightful
manner
.
I
expected
every
moment
that
my
brains
*NL*
would
be
dashed
out
against
the
trees
.
After
running
thus
for
a
*NL*
considerable
distance
,
they
finally
upset
the
cart
,
dashing
it
with
*NL*
great
force
against
a
tree
,
and
threw
themselves
into
a
dense
thicket
.
*NL*
How
I
escaped
death
,
I
do
not
know
.
There
I
was
,
entirely
alone
,
in
a
*NL*
thick
wood
,
in
a
place
new
to
me
.
My
cart
was
upset
and
shattered
,
my
*NL*
oxen
were
entangled
among
the
young
trees
,
and
there
was
none
to
*NL*
help
me
.
After
a
long
spell
of
effort
,
I
succeeded
in
getting
my
cart
*NL*
righted
,
my
oxen
disentangled
,
and
again
yoked
to
the
cart
.
I
now
*NL*
proceeded
with
my
team
to
the
place
where
I
had
,
the
day
before
,
been
*NL*
chopping
wood
,
and
loaded
my
cart
pretty
heavily
,
thinking
in
this
way
*NL*
to
tame
my
oxen
.
I
then
proceeded
on
my
way
home
.
I
had
now
consumed
*NL*
one
half
of
the
day
.
I
got
out
of
the
woods
safely
,
and
now
felt
out
of
*NL*
danger
.
I
stopped
my
oxen
to
open
the
woods
gate
;
and
just
as
I
did
so
,
*NL*
before
I
could
get
hold
of
my
ox-rope
,
the
oxen
again
started
,
rushed
*NL*
through
the
gate
,
catching
it
between
the
wheel
and
the
body
of
the
*NL*
cart
,
tearing
it
to
pieces
,
and
coming
within
a
few
inches
of
crushing
*NL*
me
against
the
gate-post
.
Thus
twice
,
in
one
short
day
,
I
escaped
death
*NL*
by
the
merest
chance
.
On
my
return
,
I
told
Mr.
Covey
what
had
happened
,
*NL*
and
how
it
happened
.
He
ordered
me
to
return
to
the
woods
again
*NL*
immediately
.
I
did
so
,
and
he
followed
on
after
me
.
Just
as
I
got
into
*NL*
the
woods
,
he
came
up
and
told
me
to
stop
my
cart
,
and
that
he
would
*NL*
teach
me
how
to
trifle
away
my
time
,
and
break
gates
.
He
then
went
to
*NL*
a
large
gum-tree
,
and
with
his
axe
cut
three
large
switches
,
and
,
after
*NL*
trimming
them
up
neatly
with
his
pocketknife
,
he
ordered
me
to
take
*NL*
off
my
clothes
.
I
made
him
no
answer
,
but
stood
with
my
clothes
on
.
He
*NL*
repeated
his
order
.
I
still
made
him
no
answer
,
nor
did
I
move
to
strip
*NL*
myself
.
Upon
this
he
rushed
at
me
with
the
fierceness
of
a
tiger
,
tore
*NL*
off
my
clothes
,
and
lashed
me
till
he
had
worn
out
his
switches
,
cutting
*NL*
me
so
savagely
as
to
leave
the
marks
visible
for
a
long
time
after
.
*NL*
This
whipping
was
the
first
of
a
number
just
like
it
,
and
for
similar
*NL*
offences
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
lived
with
Mr.
Covey
one
year
.
During
the
first
six
months
,
of
that
*NL*
year
,
scarce
a
week
passed
without
his
whipping
me
.
I
was
seldom
free
*NL*
from
a
sore
back
.
My
awkwardness
was
almost
always
his
excuse
for
*NL*
whipping
me
.
We
were
worked
fully
up
to
the
point
of
endurance
.
Long
*NL*
before
day
we
were
up
,
our
horses
fed
,
and
by
the
first
approach
of
day
*NL*
we
were
off
to
the
field
with
our
hoes
and
ploughing
teams
.
Mr.
Covey
*NL*
gave
us
enough
to
eat
,
but
scarce
time
to
eat
it
.
We
were
often
less
*NL*
than
five
minutes
taking
our
meals
.
We
were
often
in
the
field
from
the
*NL*
first
approach
of
day
till
its
last
lingering
ray
had
left
us
;
and
*NL*
at
saving-fodder
time
,
midnight
often
caught
us
in
the
field
binding
*NL*
blades
.
*NL*
*NL*
Covey
would
be
out
with
us
.
The
way
he
used
to
stand
it
,
was
this
.
He
*NL*
would
spend
the
most
of
his
afternoons
in
bed
.
He
would
then
come
out
*NL*
fresh
in
the
evening
,
ready
to
urge
us
on
with
his
words
,
example
,
and
*NL*
frequently
with
the
whip
.
Mr.
Covey
was
one
of
the
few
slaveholders
who
*NL*
could
and
did
work
with
his
hands
.
He
was
a
hard-working
man
.
He
knew
by
*NL*
himself
just
what
a
man
or
a
boy
could
do
.
There
was
no
deceiving
him
.
*NL*
His
work
went
on
in
his
absence
almost
as
well
as
in
his
presence
;
and
*NL*
he
had
the
faculty
of
making
us
feel
that
he
was
ever
present
with
us
.
*NL*
This
he
did
by
surprising
us
.
He
seldom
approached
the
spot
where
we
*NL*
were
at
work
openly
,
if
he
could
do
it
secretly
.
He
always
aimed
at
*NL*
taking
us
by
surprise
.
Such
was
his
cunning
,
that
we
used
to
call
him
,
*NL*
among
ourselves
,
``
the
snake
.
''
When
we
were
at
work
in
the
cornfield
,
he
*NL*
would
sometimes
crawl
on
his
hands
and
knees
to
avoid
detection
,
and
*NL*
all
at
once
he
would
rise
nearly
in
our
midst
,
and
scream
out
,
``
Ha
,
ha
!
*NL*
Come
,
come
!
Dash
on
,
dash
on
!
''
This
being
his
mode
of
attack
,
it
was
*NL*
never
safe
to
stop
a
single
minute
.
His
comings
were
like
a
thief
in
the
*NL*
night
.
He
appeared
to
us
as
being
ever
at
hand
.
He
was
under
every
*NL*
tree
,
behind
every
stump
,
in
every
bush
,
and
at
every
window
,
on
the
*NL*
plantation
.
He
would
sometimes
mount
his
horse
,
as
if
bound
to
St.
*NL*
Michael
's
,
a
distance
of
seven
miles
,
and
in
half
an
hour
afterwards
you
*NL*
would
see
him
coiled
up
in
the
corner
of
the
wood-fence
,
watching
every
*NL*
motion
of
the
slaves
.
He
would
,
for
this
purpose
,
leave
his
horse
tied
*NL*
up
in
the
woods
.
Again
,
he
would
sometimes
walk
up
to
us
,
and
give
us
*NL*
orders
as
though
he
was
upon
the
point
of
starting
on
a
long
journey
,
*NL*
turn
his
back
upon
us
,
and
make
as
though
he
was
going
to
the
house
*NL*
to
get
ready
;
and
,
before
he
would
get
half
way
thither
,
he
would
turn
*NL*
short
and
crawl
into
a
fence-corner
,
or
behind
some
tree
,
and
there
*NL*
watch
us
till
the
going
down
of
the
sun
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Covey
's
_
forte
_
consisted
in
his
power
to
deceive
.
His
life
was
*NL*
devoted
to
planning
and
perpetrating
the
grossest
deceptions
.
Every
*NL*
thing
he
possessed
in
the
shape
of
learning
or
religion
,
he
made
conform
*NL*
to
his
disposition
to
deceive
.
He
seemed
to
think
himself
equal
to
*NL*
deceiving
the
Almighty
.
He
would
make
a
short
prayer
in
the
morning
,
and
*NL*
a
long
prayer
at
night
;
and
,
strange
as
it
may
seem
,
few
men
would
*NL*
at
times
appear
more
devotional
than
he
.
The
exercises
of
his
family
*NL*
devotions
were
always
commenced
with
singing
;
and
,
as
he
was
a
very
poor
*NL*
singer
himself
,
the
duty
of
raising
the
hymn
generally
came
upon
me
.
He
*NL*
would
read
his
hymn
,
and
nod
at
me
to
commence
.
I
would
at
times
do
so
;
*NL*
at
others
,
I
would
not
.
My
non-compliance
would
almost
always
produce
*NL*
much
confusion
.
To
show
himself
independent
of
me
,
he
would
start
and
*NL*
stagger
through
with
his
hymn
in
the
most
discordant
manner
.
In
this
*NL*
state
of
mind
,
he
prayed
with
more
than
ordinary
spirit
.
Poor
man
!
such
*NL*
was
his
disposition
,
and
success
at
deceiving
,
I
do
verily
believe
that
*NL*
he
sometimes
deceived
himself
into
the
solemn
belief
,
that
he
was
a
*NL*
sincere
worshipper
of
the
most
high
God
;
and
this
,
too
,
at
a
time
when
*NL*
he
may
be
said
to
have
been
guilty
of
compelling
his
woman
slave
to
*NL*
commit
the
sin
of
adultery
.
The
facts
in
the
case
are
these
:
Mr.
Covey
*NL*
was
a
poor
man
;
he
was
just
commencing
in
life
;
he
was
only
able
to
buy
*NL*
one
slave
;
and
,
shocking
as
is
the
fact
,
he
bought
her
,
as
he
said
,
for
*NL*
_
a
breeder
_
.
This
woman
was
named
Caroline
.
Mr.
Covey
bought
her
from
*NL*
Mr.
Thomas
Lowe
,
about
six
miles
from
St.
Michael
's
.
She
was
a
large
,
*NL*
able-bodied
woman
,
about
twenty
years
old
.
She
had
already
given
birth
*NL*
to
one
child
,
which
proved
her
to
be
just
what
he
wanted
.
After
buying
*NL*
her
,
he
hired
a
married
man
of
Mr.
Samuel
Harrison
,
to
live
with
him
one
*NL*
year
;
and
him
he
used
to
fasten
up
with
her
every
night
!
The
result
was
,
*NL*
that
,
at
the
end
of
the
year
,
the
miserable
woman
gave
birth
to
twins
.
*NL*
At
this
result
Mr.
Covey
seemed
to
be
highly
pleased
,
both
with
the
man
*NL*
and
the
wretched
woman
.
Such
was
his
joy
,
and
that
of
his
wife
,
that
*NL*
nothing
they
could
do
for
Caroline
during
her
confinement
was
too
good
,
*NL*
or
too
hard
,
to
be
done
.
The
children
were
regarded
as
being
quite
an
*NL*
addition
to
his
wealth
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
at
any
one
time
of
my
life
more
than
another
,
I
was
made
to
drink
the
*NL*
bitterest
dregs
of
slavery
,
that
time
was
during
the
first
six
months
of
*NL*
my
stay
with
Mr.
Covey
.
We
were
worked
in
all
weathers
.
It
was
never
too
*NL*
hot
or
too
cold
;
it
could
never
rain
,
blow
,
hail
,
or
snow
,
too
hard
for
*NL*
us
to
work
in
the
field
.
Work
,
work
,
work
,
was
scarcely
more
the
order
*NL*
of
the
day
than
of
the
night
.
The
longest
days
were
too
short
for
him
,
*NL*
and
the
shortest
nights
too
long
for
him
.
I
was
somewhat
unmanageable
*NL*
when
I
first
went
there
,
but
a
few
months
of
this
discipline
tamed
me
.
*NL*
Mr.
Covey
succeeded
in
breaking
me
.
I
was
broken
in
body
,
soul
,
and
*NL*
spirit
.
My
natural
elasticity
was
crushed
,
my
intellect
languished
,
the
*NL*
disposition
to
read
departed
,
the
cheerful
spark
that
lingered
about
my
*NL*
eye
died
;
the
dark
night
of
slavery
closed
in
upon
me
;
and
behold
a
man
*NL*
transformed
into
a
brute
!
*NL*
*NL*
Sunday
was
my
only
leisure
time
.
I
spent
this
in
a
sort
of
beast-like
*NL*
stupor
,
between
sleep
and
wake
,
under
some
large
tree
.
At
times
I
*NL*
would
rise
up
,
a
flash
of
energetic
freedom
would
dart
through
my
soul
,
*NL*
accompanied
with
a
faint
beam
of
hope
,
that
flickered
for
a
moment
,
and
*NL*
then
vanished
.
I
sank
down
again
,
mourning
over
my
wretched
condition
.
*NL*
I
was
sometimes
prompted
to
take
my
life
,
and
that
of
Covey
,
but
was
*NL*
prevented
by
a
combination
of
hope
and
fear
.
My
sufferings
on
this
*NL*
plantation
seem
now
like
a
dream
rather
than
a
stern
reality
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
house
stood
within
a
few
rods
of
the
Chesapeake
Bay
,
whose
broad
*NL*
bosom
was
ever
white
with
sails
from
every
quarter
of
the
habitable
*NL*
globe
.
Those
beautiful
vessels
,
robed
in
purest
white
,
so
delightful
to
*NL*
the
eye
of
freemen
,
were
to
me
so
many
shrouded
ghosts
,
to
terrify
and
*NL*
torment
me
with
thoughts
of
my
wretched
condition
.
I
have
often
,
in
the
*NL*
deep
stillness
of
a
summer
's
Sabbath
,
stood
all
alone
upon
the
lofty
*NL*
banks
of
that
noble
bay
,
and
traced
,
with
saddened
heart
and
tearful
*NL*
eye
,
the
countless
number
of
sails
moving
off
to
the
mighty
ocean
.
The
*NL*
sight
of
these
always
affected
me
powerfully
.
My
thoughts
would
compel
*NL*
utterance
;
and
there
,
with
no
audience
but
the
Almighty
,
I
would
pour
*NL*
out
my
soul
's
complaint
,
in
my
rude
way
,
with
an
apostrophe
to
the
*NL*
moving
multitude
of
ships
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
loosed
from
your
moorings
,
and
are
free
;
I
am
fast
in
my
*NL*
chains
,
and
am
a
slave
!
You
move
merrily
before
the
gentle
gale
,
and
*NL*
I
sadly
before
the
bloody
whip
!
You
are
freedom
's
swift-winged
angels
,
*NL*
that
fly
round
the
world
;
I
am
confined
in
bands
of
iron
!
O
that
I
*NL*
were
free
!
O
,
that
I
were
on
one
of
your
gallant
decks
,
and
under
your
*NL*
protecting
wing
!
Alas
!
betwixt
me
and
you
,
the
turbid
waters
roll
.
Go
*NL*
on
,
go
on
.
O
that
I
could
also
go
!
Could
I
but
swim
!
If
I
could
fly
!
O
,
*NL*
why
was
I
born
a
man
,
of
whom
to
make
a
brute
!
The
glad
ship
is
gone
;
*NL*
she
hides
in
the
dim
distance
.
I
am
left
in
the
hottest
hell
of
unending
*NL*
slavery
.
O
God
,
save
me
!
God
,
deliver
me
!
Let
me
be
free
!
Is
there
any
*NL*
God
?
Why
am
I
a
slave
?
I
will
run
away
.
I
will
not
stand
it
.
Get
caught
,
*NL*
or
get
clear
,
I
'll
try
it
.
I
had
as
well
die
with
ague
as
the
fever
.
*NL*
I
have
only
one
life
to
lose
.
I
had
as
well
be
killed
running
as
die
*NL*
standing
.
Only
think
of
it
;
one
hundred
miles
straight
north
,
and
I
am
*NL*
free
!
Try
it
?
Yes
!
God
helping
me
,
I
will
.
It
can
not
be
that
I
shall
*NL*
live
and
die
a
slave
.
I
will
take
to
the
water
.
This
very
bay
shall
yet
*NL*
bear
me
into
freedom
.
The
steamboats
steered
in
a
north-east
course
from
*NL*
North
Point
.
I
will
do
the
same
;
and
when
I
get
to
the
head
of
the
bay
,
*NL*
I
will
turn
my
canoe
adrift
,
and
walk
straight
through
Delaware
into
*NL*
Pennsylvania
.
When
I
get
there
,
I
shall
not
be
required
to
have
a
pass
;
*NL*
I
can
travel
without
being
disturbed
.
Let
but
the
first
opportunity
*NL*
offer
,
and
,
come
what
will
,
I
am
off
.
Meanwhile
,
I
will
try
to
bear
up
*NL*
under
the
yoke
.
I
am
not
the
only
slave
in
the
world
.
Why
should
I
fret
?
*NL*
I
can
bear
as
much
as
any
of
them
.
Besides
,
I
am
but
a
boy
,
and
all
boys
*NL*
are
bound
to
some
one
.
It
may
be
that
my
misery
in
slavery
will
only
*NL*
increase
my
happiness
when
I
get
free
.
There
is
a
better
day
coming
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
I
used
to
think
,
and
thus
I
used
to
speak
to
myself
;
goaded
almost
*NL*
to
madness
at
one
moment
,
and
at
the
next
reconciling
myself
to
my
*NL*
wretched
lot
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
already
intimated
that
my
condition
was
much
worse
,
during
the
*NL*
first
six
months
of
my
stay
at
Mr.
Covey
's
,
than
in
the
last
six
.
The
*NL*
circumstances
leading
to
the
change
in
Mr.
Covey
's
course
toward
me
form
*NL*
an
epoch
in
my
humble
history
.
You
have
seen
how
a
man
was
made
a
slave
;
*NL*
you
shall
see
how
a
slave
was
made
a
man
.
On
one
of
the
hottest
days
*NL*
of
the
month
of
August
,
1833
,
Bill
Smith
,
William
Hughes
,
a
slave
named
*NL*
Eli
,
and
myself
,
were
engaged
in
fanning
wheat
.
Hughes
was
clearing
the
*NL*
fanned
wheat
from
before
the
fan
.
Eli
was
turning
,
Smith
was
feeding
,
*NL*
and
I
was
carrying
wheat
to
the
fan
.
The
work
was
simple
,
requiring
*NL*
strength
rather
than
intellect
;
yet
,
to
one
entirely
unused
to
such
*NL*
work
,
it
came
very
hard
.
About
three
o'clock
of
that
day
,
I
broke
down
;
*NL*
my
strength
failed
me
;
I
was
seized
with
a
violent
aching
of
the
head
,
*NL*
attended
with
extreme
dizziness
;
I
trembled
in
every
limb
.
Finding
what
*NL*
was
coming
,
I
nerved
myself
up
,
feeling
it
would
never
do
to
stop
work
.
*NL*
I
stood
as
long
as
I
could
stagger
to
the
hopper
with
grain
.
When
I
*NL*
could
stand
no
longer
,
I
fell
,
and
felt
as
if
held
down
by
an
immense
*NL*
weight
.
The
fan
of
course
stopped
;
every
one
had
his
own
work
to
do
;
*NL*
and
no
one
could
do
the
work
of
the
other
,
and
have
his
own
go
on
at
the
*NL*
same
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Covey
was
at
the
house
,
about
one
hundred
yards
from
the
*NL*
treading-yard
where
we
were
fanning
.
On
hearing
the
fan
stop
,
he
left
*NL*
immediately
,
and
came
to
the
spot
where
we
were
.
He
hastily
inquired
*NL*
what
the
matter
was
.
Bill
answered
that
I
was
sick
,
and
there
was
no
*NL*
one
to
bring
wheat
to
the
fan
.
I
had
by
this
time
crawled
away
under
the
*NL*
side
of
the
post
and
rail-fence
by
which
the
yard
was
enclosed
,
hoping
*NL*
to
find
relief
by
getting
out
of
the
sun
.
He
then
asked
where
I
was
.
He
*NL*
was
told
by
one
of
the
hands
.
He
came
to
the
spot
,
and
,
after
looking
at
*NL*
me
awhile
,
asked
me
what
was
the
matter
.
I
told
him
as
well
as
I
could
,
*NL*
for
I
scarce
had
strength
to
speak
.
He
then
gave
me
a
savage
kick
in
*NL*
the
side
,
and
told
me
to
get
up
.
I
tried
to
do
so
,
but
fell
back
in
the
*NL*
attempt
.
He
gave
me
another
kick
,
and
again
told
me
to
rise
.
I
again
*NL*
tried
,
and
succeeded
in
gaining
my
feet
;
but
,
stooping
to
get
the
tub
*NL*
with
which
I
was
feeding
the
fan
,
I
again
staggered
and
fell
.
While
down
*NL*
in
this
situation
,
Mr.
Covey
took
up
the
hickory
slat
with
which
Hughes
*NL*
had
been
striking
off
the
half-bushel
measure
,
and
with
it
gave
me
*NL*
a
heavy
blow
upon
the
head
,
making
a
large
wound
,
and
the
blood
ran
*NL*
freely
;
and
with
this
again
told
me
to
get
up
.
I
made
no
effort
to
*NL*
comply
,
having
now
made
up
my
mind
to
let
him
do
his
worst
.
In
a
short
*NL*
time
after
receiving
this
blow
,
my
head
grew
better
.
Mr.
Covey
had
now
*NL*
left
me
to
my
fate
.
At
this
moment
I
resolved
,
for
the
first
time
,
to
go
*NL*
to
my
master
,
enter
a
complaint
,
and
ask
his
protection
.
In
order
to
*NL*
do
this
,
I
must
that
afternoon
walk
seven
miles
;
and
this
,
under
the
*NL*
circumstances
,
was
truly
a
severe
undertaking
.
I
was
exceedingly
feeble
;
*NL*
made
so
as
much
by
the
kicks
and
blows
which
I
received
,
as
by
the
*NL*
severe
fit
of
sickness
to
which
I
had
been
subjected
.
I
,
however
,
*NL*
watched
my
chance
,
while
Covey
was
looking
in
an
opposite
direction
,
*NL*
and
started
for
St.
Michael
's
.
I
succeeded
in
getting
a
considerable
*NL*
distance
on
my
way
to
the
woods
,
when
Covey
discovered
me
,
and
called
*NL*
after
me
to
come
back
,
threatening
what
he
would
do
if
I
did
not
come
.
I
*NL*
disregarded
both
his
calls
and
his
threats
,
and
made
my
way
to
the
*NL*
woods
as
fast
as
my
feeble
state
would
allow
;
and
thinking
I
might
*NL*
be
overhauled
by
him
if
I
kept
the
road
,
I
walked
through
the
woods
,
*NL*
keeping
far
enough
from
the
road
to
avoid
detection
,
and
near
enough
*NL*
to
prevent
losing
my
way
.
I
had
not
gone
far
before
my
little
strength
*NL*
again
failed
me
.
I
could
go
no
farther
.
I
fell
down
,
and
lay
for
a
*NL*
considerable
time
.
The
blood
was
yet
oozing
from
the
wound
on
my
head
.
*NL*
For
a
time
I
thought
I
should
bleed
to
death
;
and
think
now
that
I
*NL*
should
have
done
so
,
but
that
the
blood
so
matted
my
hair
as
to
stop
*NL*
the
wound
.
After
lying
there
about
three
quarters
of
an
hour
,
I
nerved
*NL*
myself
up
again
,
and
started
on
my
way
,
through
bogs
and
briers
,
*NL*
barefooted
and
bareheaded
,
tearing
my
feet
sometimes
at
nearly
every
*NL*
step
;
and
after
a
journey
of
about
seven
miles
,
occupying
some
five
*NL*
hours
to
perform
it
,
I
arrived
at
master
's
store
.
I
then
presented
an
*NL*
appearance
enough
to
affect
any
but
a
heart
of
iron
.
From
the
crown
of
*NL*
my
head
to
my
feet
,
I
was
covered
with
blood
.
My
hair
was
all
clotted
*NL*
with
dust
and
blood
;
my
shirt
was
stiff
with
blood
.
I
suppose
I
looked
*NL*
like
a
man
who
had
escaped
a
den
of
wild
beasts
,
and
barely
escaped
*NL*
them
.
In
this
state
I
appeared
before
my
master
,
humbly
entreating
*NL*
him
to
interpose
his
authority
for
my
protection
.
I
told
him
all
the
*NL*
circumstances
as
well
as
I
could
,
and
it
seemed
,
as
I
spoke
,
at
times
to
*NL*
affect
him
.
He
would
then
walk
the
floor
,
and
seek
to
justify
Covey
by
*NL*
saying
he
expected
I
deserved
it
.
He
asked
me
what
I
wanted
.
I
told
him
,
*NL*
to
let
me
get
a
new
home
;
that
as
sure
as
I
lived
with
Mr.
Covey
again
,
*NL*
I
should
live
with
but
to
die
with
him
;
that
Covey
would
surely
kill
me
;
*NL*
he
was
in
a
fair
way
for
it
.
Master
Thomas
ridiculed
the
idea
that
there
*NL*
was
any
danger
of
Mr.
Covey
's
killing
me
,
and
said
that
he
knew
Mr.
*NL*
Covey
;
that
he
was
a
good
man
,
and
that
he
could
not
think
of
taking
me
*NL*
from
him
;
that
,
should
he
do
so
,
he
would
lose
the
whole
year
's
wages
;
*NL*
that
I
belonged
to
Mr.
Covey
for
one
year
,
and
that
I
must
go
back
to
*NL*
him
,
come
what
might
;
and
that
I
must
not
trouble
him
with
any
more
*NL*
stories
,
or
that
he
would
himself
_
get
hold
of
me
_
.
After
threatening
*NL*
me
thus
,
he
gave
me
a
very
large
dose
of
salts
,
telling
me
that
I
might
*NL*
remain
in
St.
Michael
's
that
night
,
-LRB-
it
being
quite
late
,
-RRB-
but
that
I
*NL*
must
be
off
back
to
Mr.
Covey
's
early
in
the
morning
;
and
that
if
I
did
*NL*
not
,
he
would
_
get
hold
of
me
,
_
which
meant
that
he
would
whip
me
.
*NL*
I
remained
all
night
,
and
,
according
to
his
orders
,
I
started
off
to
*NL*
Covey
's
in
the
morning
,
-LRB-
Saturday
morning
,
-RRB-
wearied
in
body
and
broken
*NL*
in
spirit
.
I
got
no
supper
that
night
,
or
breakfast
that
morning
.
I
*NL*
reached
Covey
's
about
nine
o'clock
;
and
just
as
I
was
getting
over
the
*NL*
fence
that
divided
Mrs.
Kemp
's
fields
from
ours
,
out
ran
Covey
with
*NL*
his
cowskin
,
to
give
me
another
whipping
.
Before
he
could
reach
me
,
I
*NL*
succeeded
in
getting
to
the
cornfield
;
and
as
the
corn
was
very
high
,
it
*NL*
afforded
me
the
means
of
hiding
.
He
seemed
very
angry
,
and
searched
for
*NL*
me
a
long
time
.
My
behavior
was
altogether
unaccountable
.
He
finally
*NL*
gave
up
the
chase
,
thinking
,
I
suppose
,
that
I
must
come
home
for
*NL*
something
to
eat
;
he
would
give
himself
no
further
trouble
in
looking
*NL*
for
me
.
I
spent
that
day
mostly
in
the
woods
,
having
the
alternative
*NL*
before
me
,
--
to
go
home
and
be
whipped
to
death
,
or
stay
in
the
woods
and
*NL*
be
starved
to
death
.
That
night
,
I
fell
in
with
Sandy
Jenkins
,
a
slave
*NL*
with
whom
I
was
somewhat
acquainted
.
Sandy
had
a
free
wife
who
lived
*NL*
about
four
miles
from
Mr.
Covey
's
;
and
it
being
Saturday
,
he
was
on
his
*NL*
way
to
see
her
.
I
told
him
my
circumstances
,
and
he
very
kindly
invited
*NL*
me
to
go
home
with
him
.
I
went
home
with
him
,
and
talked
this
whole
*NL*
matter
over
,
and
got
his
advice
as
to
what
course
it
was
best
for
me
to
*NL*
pursue
.
I
found
Sandy
an
old
adviser
.
He
told
me
,
with
great
solemnity
,
*NL*
I
must
go
back
to
Covey
;
but
that
before
I
went
,
I
must
go
with
him
into
*NL*
another
part
of
the
woods
,
where
there
was
a
certain
_
root
,
_
which
,
if
*NL*
I
would
take
some
of
it
with
me
,
carrying
it
_
always
on
my
right
side
,
_
*NL*
would
render
it
impossible
for
Mr.
Covey
,
or
any
other
white
man
,
to
*NL*
whip
me
.
He
said
he
had
carried
it
for
years
;
and
since
he
had
done
so
,
*NL*
he
had
never
received
a
blow
,
and
never
expected
to
while
he
carried
it
.
*NL*
I
at
first
rejected
the
idea
,
that
the
simple
carrying
of
a
root
in
my
*NL*
pocket
would
have
any
such
effect
as
he
had
said
,
and
was
not
disposed
*NL*
to
take
it
;
but
Sandy
impressed
the
necessity
with
much
earnestness
,
*NL*
telling
me
it
could
do
no
harm
,
if
it
did
no
good
.
To
please
him
,
I
at
*NL*
length
took
the
root
,
and
,
according
to
his
direction
,
carried
it
upon
*NL*
my
right
side
.
This
was
Sunday
morning
.
I
immediately
started
for
*NL*
home
;
and
upon
entering
the
yard
gate
,
out
came
Mr.
Covey
on
his
way
to
*NL*
meeting
.
He
spoke
to
me
very
kindly
,
bade
me
drive
the
pigs
from
a
lot
*NL*
near
by
,
and
passed
on
towards
the
church
.
Now
,
this
singular
conduct
of
*NL*
Mr.
Covey
really
made
me
begin
to
think
that
there
was
something
in
the
*NL*
_
root
_
which
Sandy
had
given
me
;
and
had
it
been
on
any
other
day
than
*NL*
Sunday
,
I
could
have
attributed
the
conduct
to
no
other
cause
than
the
*NL*
influence
of
that
root
;
and
as
it
was
,
I
was
half
inclined
to
think
the
*NL*
_
root
_
to
be
something
more
than
I
at
first
had
taken
it
to
be
.
All
went
*NL*
well
till
Monday
morning
.
On
this
morning
,
the
virtue
of
the
_
root
_
was
*NL*
fully
tested
.
Long
before
daylight
,
I
was
called
to
go
and
rub
,
curry
,
*NL*
and
feed
,
the
horses
.
I
obeyed
,
and
was
glad
to
obey
.
But
whilst
thus
*NL*
engaged
,
whilst
in
the
act
of
throwing
down
some
blades
from
the
loft
,
*NL*
Mr.
Covey
entered
the
stable
with
a
long
rope
;
and
just
as
I
was
half
*NL*
out
of
the
loft
,
he
caught
hold
of
my
legs
,
and
was
about
tying
me
.
As
*NL*
soon
as
I
found
what
he
was
up
to
,
I
gave
a
sudden
spring
,
and
as
I
did
*NL*
so
,
he
holding
to
my
legs
,
I
was
brought
sprawling
on
the
stable
floor
.
*NL*
Mr.
Covey
seemed
now
to
think
he
had
me
,
and
could
do
what
he
pleased
;
*NL*
but
at
this
moment
--
from
whence
came
the
spirit
I
do
n't
know
--
I
resolved
*NL*
to
fight
;
and
,
suiting
my
action
to
the
resolution
,
I
seized
Covey
hard
*NL*
by
the
throat
;
and
as
I
did
so
,
I
rose
.
He
held
on
to
me
,
and
I
to
him
.
*NL*
My
resistance
was
so
entirely
unexpected
that
Covey
seemed
taken
all
*NL*
aback
.
He
trembled
like
a
leaf
.
This
gave
me
assurance
,
and
I
held
him
*NL*
uneasy
,
causing
the
blood
to
run
where
I
touched
him
with
the
ends
of
my
*NL*
fingers
.
Mr.
Covey
soon
called
out
to
Hughes
for
help
.
Hughes
came
,
and
,
*NL*
while
Covey
held
me
,
attempted
to
tie
my
right
hand
.
While
he
was
in
the
*NL*
act
of
doing
so
,
I
watched
my
chance
,
and
gave
him
a
heavy
kick
close
*NL*
under
the
ribs
.
This
kick
fairly
sickened
Hughes
,
so
that
he
left
me
in
*NL*
the
hands
of
Mr.
Covey
.
This
kick
had
the
effect
of
not
only
weakening
*NL*
Hughes
,
but
Covey
also
.
When
he
saw
Hughes
bending
over
with
pain
,
his
*NL*
courage
quailed
.
He
asked
me
if
I
meant
to
persist
in
my
resistance
.
I
*NL*
told
him
I
did
,
come
what
might
;
that
he
had
used
me
like
a
brute
for
*NL*
six
months
,
and
that
I
was
determined
to
be
used
so
no
longer
.
With
*NL*
that
,
he
strove
to
drag
me
to
a
stick
that
was
lying
just
out
of
the
*NL*
stable
door
.
He
meant
to
knock
me
down
.
But
just
as
he
was
leaning
*NL*
over
to
get
the
stick
,
I
seized
him
with
both
hands
by
his
collar
,
and
*NL*
brought
him
by
a
sudden
snatch
to
the
ground
.
By
this
time
,
Bill
came
.
*NL*
Covey
called
upon
him
for
assistance
.
Bill
wanted
to
know
what
he
could
*NL*
do
.
Covey
said
,
``
Take
hold
of
him
,
take
hold
of
him
!
''
Bill
said
his
*NL*
master
hired
him
out
to
work
,
and
not
to
help
to
whip
me
;
so
he
left
*NL*
Covey
and
myself
to
fight
our
own
battle
out
.
We
were
at
it
for
nearly
*NL*
two
hours
.
Covey
at
length
let
me
go
,
puffing
and
blowing
at
a
great
*NL*
rate
,
saying
that
if
I
had
not
resisted
,
he
would
not
have
whipped
*NL*
me
half
so
much
.
The
truth
was
,
that
he
had
not
whipped
me
at
all
.
I
*NL*
considered
him
as
getting
entirely
the
worst
end
of
the
bargain
;
for
*NL*
he
had
drawn
no
blood
from
me
,
but
I
had
from
him
.
The
whole
six
months
*NL*
afterwards
,
that
I
spent
with
Mr.
Covey
,
he
never
laid
the
weight
of
his
*NL*
finger
upon
me
in
anger
.
He
would
occasionally
say
,
he
did
n't
want
to
*NL*
get
hold
of
me
again
.
``
No
,
''
thought
I
,
``
you
need
not
;
for
you
will
come
*NL*
off
worse
than
you
did
before
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
battle
with
Mr.
Covey
was
the
turning-point
in
my
career
as
a
*NL*
slave
.
It
rekindled
the
few
expiring
embers
of
freedom
,
and
revived
*NL*
within
me
a
sense
of
my
own
manhood
.
It
recalled
the
departed
*NL*
self-confidence
,
and
inspired
me
again
with
a
determination
to
be
free
.
*NL*
The
gratification
afforded
by
the
triumph
was
a
full
compensation
for
*NL*
whatever
else
might
follow
,
even
death
itself
.
He
only
can
understand
*NL*
the
deep
satisfaction
which
I
experienced
,
who
has
himself
repelled
by
*NL*
force
the
bloody
arm
of
slavery
.
I
felt
as
I
never
felt
before
.
It
was
*NL*
a
glorious
resurrection
,
from
the
tomb
of
slavery
,
to
the
heaven
of
*NL*
freedom
.
My
long-crushed
spirit
rose
,
cowardice
departed
,
bold
defiance
*NL*
took
its
place
;
and
I
now
resolved
that
,
however
long
I
might
remain
*NL*
a
slave
in
form
,
the
day
had
passed
forever
when
I
could
be
a
slave
in
*NL*
fact
.
I
did
not
hesitate
to
let
it
be
known
of
me
,
that
the
white
man
*NL*
who
expected
to
succeed
in
whipping
,
must
also
succeed
in
killing
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
this
time
I
was
never
again
what
might
be
called
fairly
whipped
,
*NL*
though
I
remained
a
slave
four
years
afterwards
.
I
had
several
fights
,
*NL*
but
was
never
whipped
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
for
a
long
time
a
matter
of
surprise
to
me
why
Mr.
Covey
did
not
*NL*
immediately
have
me
taken
by
the
constable
to
the
whipping-post
,
and
*NL*
there
regularly
whipped
for
the
crime
of
raising
my
hand
against
a
white
*NL*
man
in
defence
of
myself
.
And
the
only
explanation
I
can
now
think
of
*NL*
does
not
entirely
satisfy
me
;
but
such
as
it
is
,
I
will
give
it
.
Mr.
*NL*
Covey
enjoyed
the
most
unbounded
reputation
for
being
a
first-rate
*NL*
overseer
and
negro-breaker
.
It
was
of
considerable
importance
to
him
.
*NL*
That
reputation
was
at
stake
;
and
had
he
sent
me
--
a
boy
about
sixteen
*NL*
years
old
--
to
the
public
whipping-post
,
his
reputation
would
have
been
*NL*
lost
;
so
,
to
save
his
reputation
,
he
suffered
me
to
go
unpunished
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
term
of
actual
service
to
Mr.
Edward
Covey
ended
on
Christmas
day
,
*NL*
1833
.
The
days
between
Christmas
and
New
Year
's
day
are
allowed
as
*NL*
holidays
;
and
,
accordingly
,
we
were
not
required
to
perform
any
labor
,
*NL*
more
than
to
feed
and
take
care
of
the
stock
.
This
time
we
regarded
as
*NL*
our
own
,
by
the
grace
of
our
masters
;
and
we
therefore
used
or
abused
it
*NL*
nearly
as
we
pleased
.
Those
of
us
who
had
families
at
a
distance
,
were
*NL*
generally
allowed
to
spend
the
whole
six
days
in
their
society
.
This
*NL*
time
,
however
,
was
spent
in
various
ways
.
The
staid
,
sober
,
thinking
*NL*
and
industrious
ones
of
our
number
would
employ
themselves
in
making
*NL*
corn-brooms
,
mats
,
horse-collars
,
and
baskets
;
and
another
class
of
us
*NL*
would
spend
the
time
in
hunting
opossums
,
hares
,
and
coons
.
But
by
far
*NL*
the
larger
part
engaged
in
such
sports
and
merriments
as
playing
ball
,
*NL*
wrestling
,
running
foot-races
,
fiddling
,
dancing
,
and
drinking
whisky
;
*NL*
and
this
latter
mode
of
spending
the
time
was
by
far
the
most
agreeable
*NL*
to
the
feelings
of
our
masters
.
A
slave
who
would
work
during
the
*NL*
holidays
was
considered
by
our
masters
as
scarcely
deserving
them
.
He
*NL*
was
regarded
as
one
who
rejected
the
favor
of
his
master
.
It
was
deemed
*NL*
a
disgrace
not
to
get
drunk
at
Christmas
;
and
he
was
regarded
as
lazy
*NL*
indeed
,
who
had
not
provided
himself
with
the
necessary
means
,
during
*NL*
the
year
,
to
get
whisky
enough
to
last
him
through
Christmas
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
what
I
know
of
the
effect
of
these
holidays
upon
the
slave
,
I
*NL*
believe
them
to
be
among
the
most
effective
means
in
the
hands
of
*NL*
the
slaveholder
in
keeping
down
the
spirit
of
insurrection
.
Were
the
*NL*
slaveholders
at
once
to
abandon
this
practice
,
I
have
not
the
slightest
*NL*
doubt
it
would
lead
to
an
immediate
insurrection
among
the
slaves
.
*NL*
These
holidays
serve
as
conductors
,
or
safety-valves
,
to
carry
off
the
*NL*
rebellious
spirit
of
enslaved
humanity
.
But
for
these
,
the
slave
would
*NL*
be
forced
up
to
the
wildest
desperation
;
and
woe
betide
the
slaveholder
,
*NL*
the
day
he
ventures
to
remove
or
hinder
the
operation
of
those
*NL*
conductors
!
I
warn
him
that
,
in
such
an
event
,
a
spirit
will
go
forth
in
*NL*
their
midst
,
more
to
be
dreaded
than
the
most
appalling
earthquake
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
holidays
are
part
and
parcel
of
the
gross
fraud
,
wrong
,
and
*NL*
inhumanity
of
slavery
.
They
are
professedly
a
custom
established
by
*NL*
the
benevolence
of
the
slaveholders
;
but
I
undertake
to
say
,
it
is
the
*NL*
result
of
selfishness
,
and
one
of
the
grossest
frauds
committed
upon
the
*NL*
down-trodden
slave
.
They
do
not
give
the
slaves
this
time
because
they
*NL*
would
not
like
to
have
their
work
during
its
continuance
,
but
because
*NL*
they
know
it
would
be
unsafe
to
deprive
them
of
it
.
This
will
be
seen
*NL*
by
the
fact
,
that
the
slaveholders
like
to
have
their
slaves
spend
those
*NL*
days
just
in
such
a
manner
as
to
make
them
as
glad
of
their
ending
as
of
*NL*
their
beginning
.
Their
object
seems
to
be
,
to
disgust
their
slaves
with
*NL*
freedom
,
by
plunging
them
into
the
lowest
depths
of
dissipation
.
For
*NL*
instance
,
the
slaveholders
not
only
like
to
see
the
slave
drink
of
his
*NL*
own
accord
,
but
will
adopt
various
plans
to
make
him
drunk
.
One
plan
*NL*
is
,
to
make
bets
on
their
slaves
,
as
to
who
can
drink
the
most
whisky
*NL*
without
getting
drunk
;
and
in
this
way
they
succeed
in
getting
whole
*NL*
multitudes
to
drink
to
excess
.
Thus
,
when
the
slave
asks
for
virtuous
*NL*
freedom
,
the
cunning
slaveholder
,
knowing
his
ignorance
,
cheats
him
*NL*
with
a
dose
of
vicious
dissipation
,
artfully
labelled
with
the
name
of
*NL*
liberty
.
The
most
of
us
used
to
drink
it
down
,
and
the
result
was
just
*NL*
what
might
be
supposed
;
many
of
us
were
led
to
think
that
there
was
*NL*
little
to
choose
between
liberty
and
slavery
.
We
felt
,
and
very
properly
*NL*
too
,
that
we
had
almost
as
well
be
slaves
to
man
as
to
rum
.
So
,
when
the
*NL*
holidays
ended
,
we
staggered
up
from
the
filth
of
our
wallowing
,
took
a
*NL*
long
breath
,
and
marched
to
the
field
,
--
feeling
,
upon
the
whole
,
rather
*NL*
glad
to
go
,
from
what
our
master
had
deceived
us
into
a
belief
was
*NL*
freedom
,
back
to
the
arms
of
slavery
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
said
that
this
mode
of
treatment
is
a
part
of
the
whole
system
*NL*
of
fraud
and
inhumanity
of
slavery
.
It
is
so
.
The
mode
here
adopted
to
*NL*
disgust
the
slave
with
freedom
,
by
allowing
him
to
see
only
the
abuse
*NL*
of
it
,
is
carried
out
in
other
things
.
For
instance
,
a
slave
loves
*NL*
molasses
;
he
steals
some
.
His
master
,
in
many
cases
,
goes
off
to
town
,
*NL*
and
buys
a
large
quantity
;
he
returns
,
takes
his
whip
,
and
commands
the
*NL*
slave
to
eat
the
molasses
,
until
the
poor
fellow
is
made
sick
at
the
*NL*
very
mention
of
it
.
The
same
mode
is
sometimes
adopted
to
make
the
*NL*
slaves
refrain
from
asking
for
more
food
than
their
regular
allowance
.
*NL*
A
slave
runs
through
his
allowance
,
and
applies
for
more
.
His
master
is
*NL*
enraged
at
him
;
but
,
not
willing
to
send
him
off
without
food
,
gives
him
*NL*
more
than
is
necessary
,
and
compels
him
to
eat
it
within
a
given
time
.
*NL*
Then
,
if
he
complains
that
he
can
not
eat
it
,
he
is
said
to
be
satisfied
*NL*
neither
full
nor
fasting
,
and
is
whipped
for
being
hard
to
please
!
I
*NL*
have
an
abundance
of
such
illustrations
of
the
same
principle
,
drawn
*NL*
from
my
own
observation
,
but
think
the
cases
I
have
cited
sufficient
.
*NL*
The
practice
is
a
very
common
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
first
of
January
,
1834
,
I
left
Mr.
Covey
,
and
went
to
live
with
*NL*
Mr.
William
Freeland
,
who
lived
about
three
miles
from
St.
Michael
's
.
I
*NL*
soon
found
Mr.
Freeland
a
very
different
man
from
Mr.
Covey
.
Though
not
*NL*
rich
,
he
was
what
would
be
called
an
educated
southern
gentleman
.
*NL*
Mr.
Covey
,
as
I
have
shown
,
was
a
well-trained
negro-breaker
and
*NL*
slave-driver
.
The
former
-LRB-
slaveholder
though
he
was
-RRB-
seemed
to
possess
*NL*
some
regard
for
honor
,
some
reverence
for
justice
,
and
some
respect
for
*NL*
humanity
.
The
latter
seemed
totally
insensible
to
all
such
sentiments
.
*NL*
Mr.
Freeland
had
many
of
the
faults
peculiar
to
slaveholders
,
such
as
*NL*
being
very
passionate
and
fretful
;
but
I
must
do
him
the
justice
to
say
,
*NL*
that
he
was
exceedingly
free
from
those
degrading
vices
to
which
Mr.
*NL*
Covey
was
constantly
addicted
.
The
one
was
open
and
frank
,
and
we
always
*NL*
knew
where
to
find
him
.
The
other
was
a
most
artful
deceiver
,
and
*NL*
could
be
understood
only
by
such
as
were
skilful
enough
to
detect
his
*NL*
cunningly-devised
frauds
.
Another
advantage
I
gained
in
my
new
master
*NL*
was
,
he
made
no
pretensions
to
,
or
profession
of
,
religion
;
and
this
,
in
*NL*
my
opinion
,
was
truly
a
great
advantage
.
I
assert
most
unhesitatingly
,
*NL*
that
the
religion
of
the
south
is
a
mere
covering
for
the
most
horrid
*NL*
crimes
,
--
a
justifier
of
the
most
appalling
barbarity
,
--
a
sanctifier
of
*NL*
the
most
hateful
frauds
,
--
and
a
dark
shelter
under
,
which
the
darkest
,
*NL*
foulest
,
grossest
,
and
most
infernal
deeds
of
slaveholders
find
the
*NL*
strongest
protection
.
Were
I
to
be
again
reduced
to
the
chains
of
*NL*
slavery
,
next
to
that
enslavement
,
I
should
regard
being
the
slave
of
a
*NL*
religious
master
the
greatest
calamity
that
could
befall
me
.
For
of
all
*NL*
slaveholders
with
whom
I
have
ever
met
,
religious
slaveholders
are
the
*NL*
worst
.
I
have
ever
found
them
the
meanest
and
basest
,
the
most
cruel
and
*NL*
cowardly
,
of
all
others
.
It
was
my
unhappy
lot
not
only
to
belong
to
a
*NL*
religious
slaveholder
,
but
to
live
in
a
community
of
such
religionists
.
*NL*
Very
near
Mr.
Freeland
lived
the
Rev.
Daniel
Weeden
,
and
in
the
same
*NL*
neighborhood
lived
the
Rev.
Rigby
Hopkins
.
These
were
members
and
*NL*
ministers
in
the
Reformed
Methodist
Church
.
Mr.
Weeden
owned
,
among
*NL*
others
,
a
woman
slave
,
whose
name
I
have
forgotten
.
This
woman
's
*NL*
back
,
for
weeks
,
was
kept
literally
raw
,
made
so
by
the
lash
of
this
*NL*
merciless
,
_
religious
_
wretch
.
He
used
to
hire
hands
.
His
maxim
was
,
*NL*
Behave
well
or
behave
ill
,
it
is
the
duty
of
a
master
occasionally
to
*NL*
whip
a
slave
,
to
remind
him
of
his
master
's
authority
.
Such
was
his
*NL*
theory
,
and
such
his
practice
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Hopkins
was
even
worse
than
Mr.
Weeden
.
His
chief
boast
was
his
*NL*
ability
to
manage
slaves
.
The
peculiar
feature
of
his
government
was
*NL*
that
of
whipping
slaves
in
advance
of
deserving
it
.
He
always
managed
to
*NL*
have
one
or
more
of
his
slaves
to
whip
every
Monday
morning
.
He
did
this
*NL*
to
alarm
their
fears
,
and
strike
terror
into
those
who
escaped
.
His
*NL*
plan
was
to
whip
for
the
smallest
offences
,
to
prevent
the
commission
*NL*
of
large
ones
.
Mr.
Hopkins
could
always
find
some
excuse
for
whipping
*NL*
a
slave
.
It
would
astonish
one
,
unaccustomed
to
a
slaveholding
life
,
to
*NL*
see
with
what
wonderful
ease
a
slaveholder
can
find
things
,
of
which
to
*NL*
make
occasion
to
whip
a
slave
.
A
mere
look
,
word
,
or
motion
,
--
a
mistake
,
*NL*
accident
,
or
want
of
power
,
--
are
all
matters
for
which
a
slave
may
be
*NL*
whipped
at
any
time
.
Does
a
slave
look
dissatisfied
?
It
is
said
,
he
has
*NL*
the
devil
in
him
,
and
it
must
be
whipped
out
.
Does
he
speak
loudly
when
*NL*
spoken
to
by
his
master
?
Then
he
is
getting
high-minded
,
and
should
be
*NL*
taken
down
a
button-hole
lower
.
Does
he
forget
to
pull
off
his
hat
at
*NL*
the
approach
of
a
white
person
?
Then
he
is
wanting
in
reverence
,
and
*NL*
should
be
whipped
for
it
.
Does
he
ever
venture
to
vindicate
his
conduct
,
*NL*
when
censured
for
it
?
Then
he
is
guilty
of
impudence
,
--
one
of
the
*NL*
greatest
crimes
of
which
a
slave
can
be
guilty
.
Does
he
ever
venture
to
*NL*
suggest
a
different
mode
of
doing
things
from
that
pointed
out
by
*NL*
his
master
?
He
is
indeed
presumptuous
,
and
getting
above
himself
;
and
*NL*
nothing
less
than
a
flogging
will
do
for
him
.
Does
he
,
while
ploughing
,
*NL*
break
a
plough
,
--
or
,
while
hoeing
,
break
a
hoe
?
It
is
owing
to
his
*NL*
carelessness
,
and
for
it
a
slave
must
always
be
whipped
.
Mr.
Hopkins
*NL*
could
always
find
something
of
this
sort
to
justify
the
use
of
the
lash
,
*NL*
and
he
seldom
failed
to
embrace
such
opportunities
.
There
was
not
a
man
*NL*
in
the
whole
county
,
with
whom
the
slaves
who
had
the
getting
their
own
*NL*
home
,
would
not
prefer
to
live
,
rather
than
with
this
Rev.
Mr.
Hopkins
.
*NL*
And
yet
there
was
not
a
man
any
where
round
,
who
made
higher
professions
*NL*
of
religion
,
or
was
more
active
in
revivals
,
--
more
attentive
to
the
*NL*
class
,
love-feast
,
prayer
and
preaching
meetings
,
or
more
devotional
in
*NL*
his
family
,
--
that
prayed
earlier
,
later
,
louder
,
and
longer
,
--
than
this
*NL*
same
reverend
slave-driver
,
Rigby
Hopkins
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
to
return
to
Mr.
Freeland
,
and
to
my
experience
while
in
his
*NL*
employment
.
He
,
like
Mr.
Covey
,
gave
us
enough
to
eat
;
but
,
unlike
Mr.
*NL*
Covey
,
he
also
gave
us
sufficient
time
to
take
our
meals
.
He
worked
us
*NL*
hard
,
but
always
between
sunrise
and
sunset
.
He
required
a
good
deal
of
*NL*
work
to
be
done
,
but
gave
us
good
tools
with
which
to
work
.
His
farm
was
*NL*
large
,
but
he
employed
hands
enough
to
work
it
,
and
with
ease
,
compared
*NL*
with
many
of
his
neighbors
.
My
treatment
,
while
in
his
employment
,
was
*NL*
heavenly
,
compared
with
what
I
experienced
at
the
hands
of
Mr.
Edward
*NL*
Covey
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Freeland
was
himself
the
owner
of
but
two
slaves
.
Their
names
were
*NL*
Henry
Harris
and
John
Harris
.
The
rest
of
his
hands
he
hired
.
These
*NL*
consisted
of
myself
,
Sandy
Jenkins
,
*
and
Handy
Caldwell
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
This
is
the
same
man
who
gave
me
the
roots
to
prevent
my
*NL*
being
whipped
by
Mr.
Covey
.
He
was
``
a
clever
soul
.
''
We
used
*NL*
frequently
to
talk
about
the
fight
with
Covey
,
and
as
often
*NL*
as
we
did
so
,
he
would
claim
my
success
as
the
result
of
the
*NL*
roots
which
he
gave
me
.
This
superstition
is
very
common
*NL*
among
the
more
ignorant
slaves
.
A
slave
seldom
dies
but
that
*NL*
his
death
is
attributed
to
trickery
.
*NL*
*NL*
Henry
and
John
were
quite
intelligent
,
and
in
a
very
little
while
after
*NL*
I
went
there
,
I
succeeded
in
creating
in
them
a
strong
desire
to
learn
*NL*
how
to
read
.
This
desire
soon
sprang
up
in
the
others
also
.
They
very
*NL*
soon
mustered
up
some
old
spelling-books
,
and
nothing
would
do
but
that
*NL*
I
must
keep
a
Sabbath
school
.
I
agreed
to
do
so
,
and
accordingly
devoted
*NL*
my
Sundays
to
teaching
these
my
loved
fellow-slaves
how
to
read
.
Neither
*NL*
of
them
knew
his
letters
when
I
went
there
.
Some
of
the
slaves
of
the
*NL*
neighboring
farms
found
what
was
going
on
,
and
also
availed
themselves
*NL*
of
this
little
opportunity
to
learn
to
read
.
It
was
understood
,
among
*NL*
all
who
came
,
that
there
must
be
as
little
display
about
it
as
possible
.
*NL*
It
was
necessary
to
keep
our
religious
masters
at
St.
Michael
's
*NL*
unacquainted
with
the
fact
,
that
,
instead
of
spending
the
Sabbath
in
*NL*
wrestling
,
boxing
,
and
drinking
whisky
,
we
were
trying
to
learn
how
to
*NL*
read
the
will
of
God
;
for
they
had
much
rather
see
us
engaged
in
those
*NL*
degrading
sports
,
than
to
see
us
behaving
like
intellectual
,
moral
,
and
*NL*
accountable
beings
.
My
blood
boils
as
I
think
of
the
bloody
manner
in
*NL*
which
Messrs.
Wright
Fairbanks
and
Garrison
West
,
both
class-leaders
,
in
*NL*
connection
with
many
others
,
rushed
in
upon
us
with
sticks
and
stones
,
*NL*
and
broke
up
our
virtuous
little
Sabbath
school
,
at
St.
Michael
's
--
all
*NL*
calling
themselves
Christians
!
humble
followers
of
the
Lord
Jesus
*NL*
Christ
!
But
I
am
again
digressing
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
held
my
Sabbath
school
at
the
house
of
a
free
colored
man
,
whose
*NL*
name
I
deem
it
imprudent
to
mention
;
for
should
it
be
known
,
it
might
*NL*
embarrass
him
greatly
,
though
the
crime
of
holding
the
school
was
*NL*
committed
ten
years
ago
.
I
had
at
one
time
over
forty
scholars
,
and
*NL*
those
of
the
right
sort
,
ardently
desiring
to
learn
.
They
were
of
all
*NL*
ages
,
though
mostly
men
and
women
.
I
look
back
to
those
Sundays
with
an
*NL*
amount
of
pleasure
not
to
be
expressed
.
They
were
great
days
to
my
*NL*
soul
.
The
work
of
instructing
my
dear
fellow-slaves
was
the
sweetest
*NL*
engagement
with
which
I
was
ever
blessed
.
We
loved
each
other
,
and
to
*NL*
leave
them
at
the
close
of
the
Sabbath
was
a
severe
cross
indeed
.
When
*NL*
I
think
that
these
precious
souls
are
to-day
shut
up
in
the
prison-house
*NL*
of
slavery
,
my
feelings
overcome
me
,
and
I
am
almost
ready
to
ask
,
*NL*
``
Does
a
righteous
God
govern
the
universe
?
and
for
what
does
he
hold
the
*NL*
thunders
in
his
right
hand
,
if
not
to
smite
the
oppressor
,
and
deliver
*NL*
the
spoiled
out
of
the
hand
of
the
spoiler
?
''
These
dear
souls
came
not
*NL*
to
Sabbath
school
because
it
was
popular
to
do
so
,
nor
did
I
teach
them
*NL*
because
it
was
reputable
to
be
thus
engaged
.
Every
moment
they
spent
*NL*
in
that
school
,
they
were
liable
to
be
taken
up
,
and
given
thirty-nine
*NL*
lashes
.
They
came
because
they
wished
to
learn
.
Their
minds
had
*NL*
been
starved
by
their
cruel
masters
.
They
had
been
shut
up
in
mental
*NL*
darkness
.
I
taught
them
,
because
it
was
the
delight
of
my
soul
to
be
*NL*
doing
something
that
looked
like
bettering
the
condition
of
my
race
.
I
*NL*
kept
up
my
school
nearly
the
whole
year
I
lived
with
Mr.
Freeland
;
and
,
*NL*
beside
my
Sabbath
school
,
I
devoted
three
evenings
in
the
week
,
during
*NL*
the
winter
,
to
teaching
the
slaves
at
home
.
And
I
have
the
happiness
to
*NL*
know
,
that
several
of
those
who
came
to
Sabbath
school
learned
how
to
*NL*
read
;
and
that
one
,
at
least
,
is
now
free
through
my
agency
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
year
passed
off
smoothly
.
It
seemed
only
about
half
as
long
as
the
*NL*
year
which
preceded
it
.
I
went
through
it
without
receiving
a
single
*NL*
blow
.
I
will
give
Mr.
Freeland
the
credit
of
being
the
best
master
*NL*
I
ever
had
,
_
till
I
became
my
own
master
.
_
For
the
ease
with
which
I
*NL*
passed
the
year
,
I
was
,
however
,
somewhat
indebted
to
the
society
of
*NL*
my
fellow-slaves
.
They
were
noble
souls
;
they
not
only
possessed
loving
*NL*
hearts
,
but
brave
ones
.
We
were
linked
and
interlinked
with
each
other
.
*NL*
I
loved
them
with
a
love
stronger
than
any
thing
I
have
experienced
*NL*
since
.
It
is
sometimes
said
that
we
slaves
do
not
love
and
confide
in
*NL*
each
other
.
In
answer
to
this
assertion
,
I
can
say
,
I
never
loved
any
or
*NL*
confided
in
any
people
more
than
my
fellow-slaves
,
and
especially
those
*NL*
with
whom
I
lived
at
Mr.
Freeland
's
.
I
believe
we
would
have
died
for
*NL*
each
other
.
We
never
undertook
to
do
any
thing
,
of
any
importance
,
*NL*
without
a
mutual
consultation
.
We
never
moved
separately
.
We
were
*NL*
one
;
and
as
much
so
by
our
tempers
and
dispositions
,
as
by
the
mutual
*NL*
hardships
to
which
we
were
necessarily
subjected
by
our
condition
as
*NL*
slaves
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
close
of
the
year
1834
,
Mr.
Freeland
again
hired
me
of
my
master
,
*NL*
for
the
year
1835
.
But
,
by
this
time
,
I
began
to
want
to
live
_
upon
*NL*
free
land
_
as
well
as
_
with
Freeland
;
_
and
I
was
no
longer
content
,
*NL*
therefore
,
to
live
with
him
or
any
other
slaveholder
.
I
began
,
with
the
*NL*
commencement
of
the
year
,
to
prepare
myself
for
a
final
struggle
,
which
*NL*
should
decide
my
fate
one
way
or
the
other
.
My
tendency
was
upward
.
I
*NL*
was
fast
approaching
manhood
,
and
year
after
year
had
passed
,
and
I
was
*NL*
still
a
slave
.
These
thoughts
roused
me
--
I
must
do
something
.
I
therefore
*NL*
resolved
that
1835
should
not
pass
without
witnessing
an
attempt
,
on
*NL*
my
part
,
to
secure
my
liberty
.
But
I
was
not
willing
to
cherish
this
*NL*
determination
alone
.
My
fellow-slaves
were
dear
to
me
.
I
was
anxious
to
*NL*
have
them
participate
with
me
in
this
,
my
life-giving
determination
.
*NL*
I
therefore
,
though
with
great
prudence
,
commenced
early
to
ascertain
*NL*
their
views
and
feelings
in
regard
to
their
condition
,
and
to
imbue
*NL*
their
minds
with
thoughts
of
freedom
.
I
bent
myself
to
devising
ways
and
*NL*
means
for
our
escape
,
and
meanwhile
strove
,
on
all
fitting
occasions
,
*NL*
to
impress
them
with
the
gross
fraud
and
inhumanity
of
slavery
.
I
went
*NL*
first
to
Henry
,
next
to
John
,
then
to
the
others
.
I
found
,
in
them
all
,
*NL*
warm
hearts
and
noble
spirits
.
They
were
ready
to
hear
,
and
ready
to
*NL*
act
when
a
feasible
plan
should
be
proposed
.
This
was
what
I
wanted
.
*NL*
I
talked
to
them
of
our
want
of
manhood
,
if
we
submitted
to
our
*NL*
enslavement
without
at
least
one
noble
effort
to
be
free
.
We
met
often
,
*NL*
and
consulted
frequently
,
and
told
our
hopes
and
fears
,
recounted
the
*NL*
difficulties
,
real
and
imagined
,
which
we
should
be
called
on
to
*NL*
meet
.
At
times
we
were
almost
disposed
to
give
up
,
and
try
to
content
*NL*
ourselves
with
our
wretched
lot
;
at
others
,
we
were
firm
and
unbending
*NL*
in
our
determination
to
go
.
Whenever
we
suggested
any
plan
,
there
was
*NL*
shrinking
--
the
odds
were
fearful
.
Our
path
was
beset
with
the
greatest
*NL*
obstacles
;
and
if
we
succeeded
in
gaining
the
end
of
it
,
our
right
to
be
*NL*
free
was
yet
questionable
--
we
were
yet
liable
to
be
returned
to
bondage
.
*NL*
We
could
see
no
spot
,
this
side
of
the
ocean
,
where
we
could
be
free
.
*NL*
We
knew
nothing
about
Canada
.
Our
knowledge
of
the
north
did
not
extend
*NL*
farther
than
New
York
;
and
to
go
there
,
and
be
forever
harassed
with
the
*NL*
frightful
liability
of
being
returned
to
slavery
--
with
the
certainty
of
*NL*
being
treated
tenfold
worse
than
before
--
the
thought
was
truly
a
horrible
*NL*
one
,
and
one
which
it
was
not
easy
to
overcome
.
The
case
sometimes
stood
*NL*
thus
:
At
every
gate
through
which
we
were
to
pass
,
we
saw
a
watchman
--
at
*NL*
every
ferry
a
guard
--
on
every
bridge
a
sentinel
--
and
in
every
wood
a
*NL*
patrol
.
We
were
hemmed
in
upon
every
side
.
Here
were
the
difficulties
,
*NL*
real
or
imagined
--
the
good
to
be
sought
,
and
the
evil
to
be
shunned
.
On
*NL*
the
one
hand
,
there
stood
slavery
,
a
stern
reality
,
glaring
frightfully
*NL*
upon
us
,
--
its
robes
already
crimsoned
with
the
blood
of
millions
,
and
*NL*
even
now
feasting
itself
greedily
upon
our
own
flesh
.
On
the
other
hand
,
*NL*
away
back
in
the
dim
distance
,
under
the
flickering
light
of
the
north
*NL*
star
,
behind
some
craggy
hill
or
snow-covered
mountain
,
stood
a
doubtful
*NL*
freedom
--
half
frozen
--
beckoning
us
to
come
and
share
its
hospitality
.
*NL*
This
in
itself
was
sometimes
enough
to
stagger
us
;
but
when
we
permitted
*NL*
ourselves
to
survey
the
road
,
we
were
frequently
appalled
.
Upon
either
*NL*
side
we
saw
grim
death
,
assuming
the
most
horrid
shapes
.
Now
it
was
*NL*
starvation
,
causing
us
to
eat
our
own
flesh
;
--
now
we
were
contending
with
*NL*
the
waves
,
and
were
drowned
;
--
now
we
were
overtaken
,
and
torn
to
pieces
*NL*
by
the
fangs
of
the
terrible
bloodhound
.
We
were
stung
by
scorpions
,
*NL*
chased
by
wild
beasts
,
bitten
by
snakes
,
and
finally
,
after
having
*NL*
nearly
reached
the
desired
spot
,
--
after
swimming
rivers
,
encountering
*NL*
wild
beasts
,
sleeping
in
the
woods
,
suffering
hunger
and
nakedness
,
--
we
*NL*
were
overtaken
by
our
pursuers
,
and
,
in
our
resistance
,
we
were
shot
*NL*
dead
upon
the
spot
!
I
say
,
this
picture
sometimes
appalled
us
,
and
made
*NL*
us
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
rather
bear
those
ills
we
had
,
*NL*
Than
fly
to
others
,
that
we
knew
not
of
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
coming
to
a
fixed
determination
to
run
away
,
we
did
more
than
Patrick
*NL*
Henry
,
when
he
resolved
upon
liberty
or
death
.
With
us
it
was
a
doubtful
*NL*
liberty
at
most
,
and
almost
certain
death
if
we
failed
.
For
my
part
,
I
*NL*
should
prefer
death
to
hopeless
bondage
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sandy
,
one
of
our
number
,
gave
up
the
notion
,
but
still
encouraged
us
.
*NL*
Our
company
then
consisted
of
Henry
Harris
,
John
Harris
,
Henry
Bailey
,
*NL*
Charles
Roberts
,
and
myself
.
Henry
Bailey
was
my
uncle
,
and
belonged
*NL*
to
my
master
.
Charles
married
my
aunt
:
he
belonged
to
my
master
's
*NL*
father-in-law
,
Mr.
William
Hamilton
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
plan
we
finally
concluded
upon
was
,
to
get
a
large
canoe
belonging
*NL*
to
Mr.
Hamilton
,
and
upon
the
Saturday
night
previous
to
Easter
*NL*
holidays
,
paddle
directly
up
the
Chesapeake
Bay
.
On
our
arrival
at
the
*NL*
head
of
the
bay
,
a
distance
of
seventy
or
eighty
miles
from
where
we
*NL*
lived
,
it
was
our
purpose
to
turn
our
canoe
adrift
,
and
follow
the
*NL*
guidance
of
the
north
star
till
we
got
beyond
the
limits
of
Maryland
.
*NL*
Our
reason
for
taking
the
water
route
was
,
that
we
were
less
liable
to
*NL*
be
suspected
as
runaways
;
we
hoped
to
be
regarded
as
fishermen
;
*NL*
whereas
,
if
we
should
take
the
land
route
,
we
should
be
subjected
to
*NL*
interruptions
of
almost
every
kind
.
Any
one
having
a
white
face
,
and
*NL*
being
so
disposed
,
could
stop
us
,
and
subject
us
to
examination
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
week
before
our
intended
start
,
I
wrote
several
protections
,
one
for
*NL*
each
of
us
.
As
well
as
I
can
remember
,
they
were
in
the
following
words
,
*NL*
to
wit
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
to
certify
that
I
,
the
undersigned
,
have
given
the
bearer
,
my
*NL*
servant
,
full
liberty
to
go
to
Baltimore
,
and
spend
the
Easter
holidays
.
*NL*

mine
own
hand

WILLIAM
HAMILTON
,

``
Near
St.
Michael
's

in
Talbot
county
,
Maryland

''
*NL*
*NL*
We
were
not
going
to
Baltimore
;
but
,
in
going
up
the
bay
,
we
went
toward
*NL*
Baltimore
,
and
these
protections
were
only
intended
to
protect
us
while
*NL*
on
the
bay
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
time
drew
near
for
our
departure
,
our
anxiety
became
more
and
*NL*
more
intense
.
It
was
truly
a
matter
of
life
and
death
with
us
.
The
*NL*
strength
of
our
determination
was
about
to
be
fully
tested
.
At
this
*NL*
time
,
I
was
very
active
in
explaining
every
difficulty
,
removing
every
*NL*
doubt
,
dispelling
every
fear
,
and
inspiring
all
with
the
firmness
*NL*
indispensable
to
success
in
our
undertaking
;
assuring
them
that
half
was
*NL*
gained
the
instant
we
made
the
move
;
we
had
talked
long
enough
;
we
were
*NL*
now
ready
to
move
;
if
not
now
,
we
never
should
be
;
and
if
we
did
*NL*
not
intend
to
move
now
,
we
had
as
well
fold
our
arms
,
sit
down
,
and
*NL*
acknowledge
ourselves
fit
only
to
be
slaves
.
This
,
none
of
us
were
*NL*
prepared
to
acknowledge
.
Every
man
stood
firm
;
and
at
our
last
meeting
,
*NL*
we
pledged
ourselves
afresh
,
in
the
most
solemn
manner
,
that
,
at
the
*NL*
time
appointed
,
we
would
certainly
start
in
pursuit
of
freedom
.
This
*NL*
was
in
the
middle
of
the
week
,
at
the
end
of
which
we
were
to
be
off
.
We
*NL*
went
,
as
usual
,
to
our
several
fields
of
labor
,
but
with
bosoms
highly
*NL*
agitated
with
thoughts
of
our
truly
hazardous
undertaking
.
We
tried
to
*NL*
conceal
our
feelings
as
much
as
possible
;
and
I
think
we
succeeded
very
*NL*
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
painful
waiting
,
the
Saturday
morning
,
whose
night
was
to
*NL*
witness
our
departure
,
came
.
I
hailed
it
with
joy
,
bring
what
of
sadness
*NL*
it
might
.
Friday
night
was
a
sleepless
one
for
me
.
I
probably
felt
more
*NL*
anxious
than
the
rest
,
because
I
was
,
by
common
consent
,
at
the
head
of
*NL*
the
whole
affair
.
The
responsibility
of
success
or
failure
lay
heavily
*NL*
upon
me
.
The
glory
of
the
one
,
and
the
confusion
of
the
other
,
were
*NL*
alike
mine
.
The
first
two
hours
of
that
morning
were
such
as
I
never
*NL*
experienced
before
,
and
hope
never
to
again
.
Early
in
the
morning
,
we
*NL*
went
,
as
usual
,
to
the
field
.
We
were
spreading
manure
;
and
all
at
once
,
*NL*
while
thus
engaged
,
I
was
overwhelmed
with
an
indescribable
feeling
,
in
*NL*
the
fulness
of
which
I
turned
to
Sandy
,
who
was
near
by
,
and
said
,
``
We
*NL*
are
betrayed
!
''
``
Well
,
''
said
he
,
``
that
thought
has
this
moment
struck
*NL*
me
.
''
We
said
no
more
.
I
was
never
more
certain
of
any
thing
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
horn
was
blown
as
usual
,
and
we
went
up
from
the
field
to
the
house
*NL*
for
breakfast
.
I
went
for
the
form
,
more
than
for
want
of
any
thing
to
*NL*
eat
that
morning
.
Just
as
I
got
to
the
house
,
in
looking
out
at
the
lane
*NL*
gate
,
I
saw
four
white
men
,
with
two
colored
men
.
The
white
men
were
*NL*
on
horseback
,
and
the
colored
ones
were
walking
behind
,
as
if
tied
.
I
*NL*
watched
them
a
few
moments
till
they
got
up
to
our
lane
gate
.
Here
they
*NL*
halted
,
and
tied
the
colored
men
to
the
gate-post
.
I
was
not
yet
certain
*NL*
as
to
what
the
matter
was
.
In
a
few
moments
,
in
rode
Mr.
Hamilton
,
with
*NL*
a
speed
betokening
great
excitement
.
He
came
to
the
door
,
and
inquired
*NL*
if
Master
William
was
in
.
He
was
told
he
was
at
the
barn
.
Mr.
Hamilton
,
*NL*
without
dismounting
,
rode
up
to
the
barn
with
extraordinary
speed
.
In
*NL*
a
few
moments
,
he
and
Mr.
Freeland
returned
to
the
house
.
By
this
time
,
*NL*
the
three
constables
rode
up
,
and
in
great
haste
dismounted
,
tied
their
*NL*
horses
,
and
met
Master
William
and
Mr.
Hamilton
returning
from
the
barn
;
*NL*
and
after
talking
awhile
,
they
all
walked
up
to
the
kitchen
door
.
There
*NL*
was
no
one
in
the
kitchen
but
myself
and
John
.
Henry
and
Sandy
were
up
*NL*
at
the
barn
.
Mr.
Freeland
put
his
head
in
at
the
door
,
and
called
me
by
*NL*
name
,
saying
,
there
were
some
gentlemen
at
the
door
who
wished
to
see
*NL*
me
.
I
stepped
to
the
door
,
and
inquired
what
they
wanted
.
They
at
once
*NL*
seized
me
,
and
,
without
giving
me
any
satisfaction
,
tied
me
--
lashing
my
*NL*
hands
closely
together
.
I
insisted
upon
knowing
what
the
matter
was
.
*NL*
They
at
length
said
,
that
they
had
learned
I
had
been
in
a
``
scrape
,
''
*NL*
and
that
I
was
to
be
examined
before
my
master
;
and
if
their
information
*NL*
proved
false
,
I
should
not
be
hurt
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
few
moments
,
they
succeeded
in
tying
John
.
They
then
turned
to
*NL*
Henry
,
who
had
by
this
time
returned
,
and
commanded
him
to
cross
his
*NL*
hands
.
``
I
wo
n't
!
''
said
Henry
,
in
a
firm
tone
,
indicating
his
readiness
*NL*
to
meet
the
consequences
of
his
refusal
.
``
Wo
n't
you
?
''
said
Tom
Graham
,
*NL*
the
constable
.
``
No
,
I
wo
n't
!
''
said
Henry
,
in
a
still
stronger
tone
.
With
*NL*
this
,
two
of
the
constables
pulled
out
their
shining
pistols
,
and
swore
,
*NL*
by
their
Creator
,
that
they
would
make
him
cross
his
hands
or
kill
him
.
*NL*
Each
cocked
his
pistol
,
and
,
with
fingers
on
the
trigger
,
walked
up
to
*NL*
Henry
,
saying
,
at
the
same
time
,
if
he
did
not
cross
his
hands
,
they
*NL*
would
blow
his
damned
heart
out
.
``
Shoot
me
,
shoot
me
!
''
said
Henry
;
``
you
*NL*
ca
n't
kill
me
but
once
.
Shoot
,
shoot
,
--
and
be
damned
!
_
I
wo
n't
be
tied
!
_
''
*NL*
This
he
said
in
a
tone
of
loud
defiance
;
and
at
the
same
time
,
with
*NL*
a
motion
as
quick
as
lightning
,
he
with
one
single
stroke
dashed
the
*NL*
pistols
from
the
hand
of
each
constable
.
As
he
did
this
,
all
hands
fell
*NL*
upon
him
,
and
,
after
beating
him
some
time
,
they
finally
overpowered
*NL*
him
,
and
got
him
tied
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
scuffle
,
I
managed
,
I
know
not
how
,
to
get
my
pass
out
,
and
,
*NL*
without
being
discovered
,
put
it
into
the
fire
.
We
were
all
now
tied
;
*NL*
and
just
as
we
were
to
leave
for
Easton
jail
,
Betsy
Freeland
,
mother
of
*NL*
William
Freeland
,
came
to
the
door
with
her
hands
full
of
biscuits
,
and
*NL*
divided
them
between
Henry
and
John
.
She
then
delivered
herself
of
a
*NL*
speech
,
to
the
following
effect
:
--
addressing
herself
to
me
,
she
said
,
*NL*
''
_
You
devil
!
You
yellow
devil
!
_
it
was
you
that
put
it
into
the
heads
of
*NL*
Henry
and
John
to
run
away
.
But
for
you
,
you
long-legged
mulatto
devil
!
*NL*
Henry
nor
John
would
never
have
thought
of
such
a
thing
.
''
I
made
no
*NL*
reply
,
and
was
immediately
hurried
off
towards
St.
Michael
's
.
Just
a
*NL*
moment
previous
to
the
scuffle
with
Henry
,
Mr.
Hamilton
suggested
the
*NL*
propriety
of
making
a
search
for
the
protections
which
he
had
understood
*NL*
Frederick
had
written
for
himself
and
the
rest
.
But
,
just
at
the
moment
*NL*
he
was
about
carrying
his
proposal
into
effect
,
his
aid
was
needed
in
*NL*
helping
to
tie
Henry
;
and
the
excitement
attending
the
scuffle
caused
*NL*
them
either
to
forget
,
or
to
deem
it
unsafe
,
under
the
circumstances
,
to
*NL*
search
.
So
we
were
not
yet
convicted
of
the
intention
to
run
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
got
about
half
way
to
St.
Michael
's
,
while
the
constables
having
*NL*
us
in
charge
were
looking
ahead
,
Henry
inquired
of
me
what
he
should
do
*NL*
with
his
pass
.
I
told
him
to
eat
it
with
his
biscuit
,
and
own
nothing
;
*NL*
and
we
passed
the
word
around
,
''
_
Own
nothing
;
_
''
and
''
_
Own
nothing
!
_
''
*NL*
said
we
all
.
Our
confidence
in
each
other
was
unshaken
.
We
were
resolved
*NL*
to
succeed
or
fail
together
,
after
the
calamity
had
befallen
us
as
much
*NL*
as
before
.
We
were
now
prepared
for
any
thing
.
We
were
to
be
dragged
*NL*
that
morning
fifteen
miles
behind
horses
,
and
then
to
be
placed
in
*NL*
the
Easton
jail
.
When
we
reached
St.
Michael
's
,
we
underwent
a
sort
of
*NL*
examination
.
We
all
denied
that
we
ever
intended
to
run
away
.
We
did
*NL*
this
more
to
bring
out
the
evidence
against
us
,
than
from
any
hope
of
*NL*
getting
clear
of
being
sold
;
for
,
as
I
have
said
,
we
were
ready
for
*NL*
that
.
The
fact
was
,
we
cared
but
little
where
we
went
,
so
we
went
*NL*
together
.
Our
greatest
concern
was
about
separation
.
We
dreaded
that
*NL*
more
than
any
thing
this
side
of
death
.
We
found
the
evidence
against
us
*NL*
to
be
the
testimony
of
one
person
;
our
master
would
not
tell
who
it
*NL*
was
;
but
we
came
to
a
unanimous
decision
among
ourselves
as
to
who
*NL*
their
informant
was
.
We
were
sent
off
to
the
jail
at
Easton
.
When
we
got
*NL*
there
,
we
were
delivered
up
to
the
sheriff
,
Mr.
Joseph
Graham
,
and
by
*NL*
him
placed
in
jail
.
Henry
,
John
,
and
myself
,
were
placed
in
one
*NL*
room
together
--
Charles
,
and
Henry
Bailey
,
in
another
.
Their
object
in
*NL*
separating
us
was
to
hinder
concert
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
been
in
jail
scarcely
twenty
minutes
,
when
a
swarm
of
slave
*NL*
traders
,
and
agents
for
slave
traders
,
flocked
into
jail
to
look
at
us
,
*NL*
and
to
ascertain
if
we
were
for
sale
.
Such
a
set
of
beings
I
never
saw
*NL*
before
!
I
felt
myself
surrounded
by
so
many
fiends
from
perdition
.
A
*NL*
band
of
pirates
never
looked
more
like
their
father
,
the
devil
.
They
*NL*
laughed
and
grinned
over
us
,
saying
,
``
Ah
,
my
boys
!
we
have
got
you
,
*NL*
have
n't
we
?
''
And
after
taunting
us
in
various
ways
,
they
one
by
one
*NL*
went
into
an
examination
of
us
,
with
intent
to
ascertain
our
value
.
*NL*
They
would
impudently
ask
us
if
we
would
not
like
to
have
them
for
our
*NL*
masters
.
We
would
make
them
no
answer
,
and
leave
them
to
find
out
as
*NL*
best
they
could
.
Then
they
would
curse
and
swear
at
us
,
telling
us
that
*NL*
they
could
take
the
devil
out
of
us
in
a
very
little
while
,
if
we
were
*NL*
only
in
their
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
in
jail
,
we
found
ourselves
in
much
more
comfortable
quarters
than
*NL*
we
expected
when
we
went
there
.
We
did
not
get
much
to
eat
,
nor
that
*NL*
which
was
very
good
;
but
we
had
a
good
clean
room
,
from
the
windows
of
*NL*
which
we
could
see
what
was
going
on
in
the
street
,
which
was
very
much
*NL*
better
than
though
we
had
been
placed
in
one
of
the
dark
,
damp
cells
.
*NL*
Upon
the
whole
,
we
got
along
very
well
,
so
far
as
the
jail
and
its
*NL*
keeper
were
concerned
.
Immediately
after
the
holidays
were
over
,
*NL*
contrary
to
all
our
expectations
,
Mr.
Hamilton
and
Mr.
Freeland
came
up
*NL*
to
Easton
,
and
took
Charles
,
the
two
Henrys
,
and
John
,
out
of
jail
,
and
*NL*
carried
them
home
,
leaving
me
alone
.
I
regarded
this
separation
as
*NL*
a
final
one
.
It
caused
me
more
pain
than
any
thing
else
in
the
whole
*NL*
transaction
.
I
was
ready
for
any
thing
rather
than
separation
.
I
*NL*
supposed
that
they
had
consulted
together
,
and
had
decided
that
,
as
I
*NL*
was
the
whole
cause
of
the
intention
of
the
others
to
run
away
,
it
was
*NL*
hard
to
make
the
innocent
suffer
with
the
guilty
;
and
that
they
had
,
*NL*
therefore
,
concluded
to
take
the
others
home
,
and
sell
me
,
as
a
warning
*NL*
to
the
others
that
remained
.
It
is
due
to
the
noble
Henry
to
say
,
he
*NL*
seemed
almost
as
reluctant
at
leaving
the
prison
as
at
leaving
home
*NL*
to
come
to
the
prison
.
But
we
knew
we
should
,
in
all
probability
,
*NL*
be
separated
,
if
we
were
sold
;
and
since
he
was
in
their
hands
,
he
*NL*
concluded
to
go
peaceably
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
now
left
to
my
fate
.
I
was
all
alone
,
and
within
the
walls
of
a
*NL*
stone
prison
.
But
a
few
days
before
,
and
I
was
full
of
hope
.
I
expected
*NL*
to
have
been
safe
in
a
land
of
freedom
;
but
now
I
was
covered
with
*NL*
gloom
,
sunk
down
to
the
utmost
despair
.
I
thought
the
possibility
of
*NL*
freedom
was
gone
.
I
was
kept
in
this
way
about
one
week
,
at
the
end
of
*NL*
which
,
Captain
Auld
,
my
master
,
to
my
surprise
and
utter
astonishment
,
*NL*
came
up
,
and
took
me
out
,
with
the
intention
of
sending
me
,
with
a
*NL*
gentleman
of
his
acquaintance
,
into
Alabama
.
But
,
from
some
cause
or
*NL*
other
,
he
did
not
send
me
to
Alabama
,
but
concluded
to
send
me
back
to
*NL*
Baltimore
,
to
live
again
with
his
brother
Hugh
,
and
to
learn
a
trade
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
,
after
an
absence
of
three
years
and
one
month
,
I
was
once
more
*NL*
permitted
to
return
to
my
old
home
at
Baltimore
.
My
master
sent
me
*NL*
away
,
because
there
existed
against
me
a
very
great
prejudice
in
the
*NL*
community
,
and
he
feared
I
might
be
killed
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
few
weeks
after
I
went
to
Baltimore
,
Master
Hugh
hired
me
to
Mr.
*NL*
William
Gardner
,
an
extensive
ship-builder
,
on
Fell
's
Point
.
I
was
put
*NL*
there
to
learn
how
to
calk
.
It
,
however
,
proved
a
very
unfavorable
place
*NL*
for
the
accomplishment
of
this
object
.
Mr.
Gardner
was
engaged
that
*NL*
spring
in
building
two
large
man-of-war
brigs
,
professedly
for
the
*NL*
Mexican
government
.
The
vessels
were
to
be
launched
in
the
July
of
that
*NL*
year
,
and
in
failure
thereof
,
Mr.
Gardner
was
to
lose
a
considerable
*NL*
sum
;
so
that
when
I
entered
,
all
was
hurry
.
There
was
no
time
to
learn
*NL*
any
thing
.
Every
man
had
to
do
that
which
he
knew
how
to
do
.
In
entering
*NL*
the
shipyard
,
my
orders
from
Mr.
Gardner
were
,
to
do
whatever
the
*NL*
carpenters
commanded
me
to
do
.
This
was
placing
me
at
the
beck
and
call
*NL*
of
about
seventy-five
men
.
I
was
to
regard
all
these
as
masters
.
Their
*NL*
word
was
to
be
my
law
.
My
situation
was
a
most
trying
one
.
At
times
I
*NL*
needed
a
dozen
pair
of
hands
.
I
was
called
a
dozen
ways
in
the
space
of
*NL*
a
single
minute
.
Three
or
four
voices
would
strike
my
ear
at
the
same
*NL*
moment
.
It
was
--
``
Fred.
,
come
help
me
to
cant
this
timber
here
.
''
--
``
Fred.
,
*NL*
come
carry
this
timber
yonder
.
''
--
``
Fred.
,
bring
that
roller
here
.
''
--
``
Fred.
,
*NL*
go
get
a
fresh
can
of
water
.
''
--
``
Fred.
,
come
help
saw
off
the
end
of
this
*NL*
timber
.
''
--
``
Fred.
,
go
quick
,
and
get
the
crowbar
.
''
--
``
Fred.
,
hold
on
the
*NL*
end
of
this
fall
.
''
--
``
Fred.
,
go
to
the
blacksmith
's
shop
,
and
get
a
new
*NL*
punch
.
''
--
``
Hurra
,
Fred
!
run
and
bring
me
a
cold
chisel
.
''
--
``
I
say
,
Fred.
,
*NL*
bear
a
hand
,
and
get
up
a
fire
as
quick
as
lightning
under
that
*NL*
steam-box
.
''
--
``
Halloo
,
nigger
!
come
,
turn
this
grindstone
.
''
--
``
Come
,
come
!
*NL*
move
,
move
!
and
_
bowse
_
this
timber
forward
.
''
--
``
I
say
,
darky
,
blast
*NL*
your
eyes
,
why
do
n't
you
heat
up
some
pitch
?
''
--
``
Halloo
!
halloo
!
halloo
!
''
*NL*
-LRB-
Three
voices
at
the
same
time
.
-RRB-
``
Come
here
!
--
Go
there
!
--
Hold
on
where
you
*NL*
are
!
Damn
you
,
if
you
move
,
I
'll
knock
your
brains
out
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
my
school
for
eight
months
;
and
I
might
have
remained
there
*NL*
longer
,
but
for
a
most
horrid
fight
I
had
with
four
of
the
white
*NL*
apprentices
,
in
which
my
left
eye
was
nearly
knocked
out
,
and
I
was
*NL*
horribly
mangled
in
other
respects
.
The
facts
in
the
case
were
*NL*
these
:
Until
a
very
little
while
after
I
went
there
,
white
and
black
*NL*
ship-carpenters
worked
side
by
side
,
and
no
one
seemed
to
see
any
*NL*
impropriety
in
it
.
All
hands
seemed
to
be
very
well
satisfied
.
Many
of
*NL*
the
black
carpenters
were
freemen
.
Things
seemed
to
be
going
on
very
*NL*
well
.
All
at
once
,
the
white
carpenters
knocked
off
,
and
said
they
would
*NL*
not
work
with
free
colored
workmen
.
Their
reason
for
this
,
as
alleged
,
*NL*
was
,
that
if
free
colored
carpenters
were
encouraged
,
they
would
soon
*NL*
take
the
trade
into
their
own
hands
,
and
poor
white
men
would
be
thrown
*NL*
out
of
employment
.
They
therefore
felt
called
upon
at
once
to
put
a
stop
*NL*
to
it
.
And
,
taking
advantage
of
Mr.
Gardner
's
necessities
,
they
broke
*NL*
off
,
swearing
they
would
work
no
longer
,
unless
he
would
discharge
his
*NL*
black
carpenters
.
Now
,
though
this
did
not
extend
to
me
in
form
,
it
*NL*
did
reach
me
in
fact
.
My
fellow-apprentices
very
soon
began
to
feel
it
*NL*
degrading
to
them
to
work
with
me
.
They
began
to
put
on
airs
,
and
*NL*
talk
about
the
``
niggers
''
taking
the
country
,
saying
we
all
ought
to
be
*NL*
killed
;
and
,
being
encouraged
by
the
journeymen
,
they
commenced
*NL*
making
my
condition
as
hard
as
they
could
,
by
hectoring
me
around
,
and
*NL*
sometimes
striking
me
.
I
,
of
course
,
kept
the
vow
I
made
after
the
fight
*NL*
with
Mr.
Covey
,
and
struck
back
again
,
regardless
of
consequences
;
and
*NL*
while
I
kept
them
from
combining
,
I
succeeded
very
well
;
for
I
could
*NL*
whip
the
whole
of
them
,
taking
them
separately
.
They
,
however
,
at
*NL*
length
combined
,
and
came
upon
me
,
armed
with
sticks
,
stones
,
and
heavy
*NL*
handspikes
.
One
came
in
front
with
a
half
brick
.
There
was
one
at
each
*NL*
side
of
me
,
and
one
behind
me
.
While
I
was
attending
to
those
in
front
,
*NL*
and
on
either
side
,
the
one
behind
ran
up
with
the
handspike
,
and
struck
*NL*
me
a
heavy
blow
upon
the
head
.
It
stunned
me
.
I
fell
,
and
with
this
they
*NL*
all
ran
upon
me
,
and
fell
to
beating
me
with
their
fists
.
I
let
them
*NL*
lay
on
for
a
while
,
gathering
strength
.
In
an
instant
,
I
gave
a
sudden
*NL*
surge
,
and
rose
to
my
hands
and
knees
.
Just
as
I
did
that
,
one
of
their
*NL*
number
gave
me
,
with
his
heavy
boot
,
a
powerful
kick
in
the
left
eye
.
*NL*
My
eyeball
seemed
to
have
burst
.
When
they
saw
my
eye
closed
,
and
badly
*NL*
swollen
,
they
left
me
.
With
this
I
seized
the
handspike
,
and
for
a
time
*NL*
pursued
them
.
But
here
the
carpenters
interfered
,
and
I
thought
I
might
*NL*
as
well
give
it
up
.
It
was
impossible
to
stand
my
hand
against
so
*NL*
many
.
All
this
took
place
in
sight
of
not
less
than
fifty
white
*NL*
ship-carpenters
,
and
not
one
interposed
a
friendly
word
;
but
some
cried
,
*NL*
``
Kill
the
damned
nigger
!
Kill
him
!
kill
him
!
He
struck
a
white
person
.
''
*NL*
I
found
my
only
chance
for
life
was
in
flight
.
I
succeeded
in
getting
*NL*
away
without
an
additional
blow
,
and
barely
so
;
for
to
strike
a
white
*NL*
man
is
death
by
Lynch
law
,
--
and
that
was
the
law
in
Mr.
Gardner
's
*NL*
ship-yard
;
nor
is
there
much
of
any
other
out
of
Mr.
Gardner
's
*NL*
ship-yard
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
went
directly
home
,
and
told
the
story
of
my
wrongs
to
Master
Hugh
;
*NL*
and
I
am
happy
to
say
of
him
,
irreligious
as
he
was
,
his
conduct
*NL*
was
heavenly
,
compared
with
that
of
his
brother
Thomas
under
similar
*NL*
circumstances
.
He
listened
attentively
to
my
narration
of
the
*NL*
circumstances
leading
to
the
savage
outrage
,
and
gave
many
proofs
of
*NL*
his
strong
indignation
at
it
.
The
heart
of
my
once
overkind
mistress
was
*NL*
again
melted
into
pity
.
My
puffed-out
eye
and
blood-covered
face
moved
*NL*
her
to
tears
.
She
took
a
chair
by
me
,
washed
the
blood
from
my
face
,
*NL*
and
,
with
a
mother
's
tenderness
,
bound
up
my
head
,
covering
the
wounded
*NL*
eye
with
a
lean
piece
of
fresh
beef
.
It
was
almost
compensation
for
my
*NL*
suffering
to
witness
,
once
more
,
a
manifestation
of
kindness
from
this
,
*NL*
my
once
affectionate
old
mistress
.
Master
Hugh
was
very
much
enraged
.
He
*NL*
gave
expression
to
his
feelings
by
pouring
out
curses
upon
the
heads
*NL*
of
those
who
did
the
deed
.
As
soon
as
I
got
a
little
the
better
of
my
*NL*
bruises
,
he
took
me
with
him
to
Esquire
Watson
's
,
on
Bond
Street
,
to
*NL*
see
what
could
be
done
about
the
matter
.
Mr.
Watson
inquired
who
saw
*NL*
the
assault
committed
.
Master
Hugh
told
him
it
was
done
in
Mr.
Gardner
's
*NL*
ship-yard
at
midday
,
where
there
were
a
large
company
of
men
at
work
.
*NL*
``
As
to
that
,
''
he
said
,
``
the
deed
was
done
,
and
there
was
no
question
as
*NL*
to
who
did
it
.
''
His
answer
was
,
he
could
do
nothing
in
the
case
,
unless
*NL*
some
white
man
would
come
forward
and
testify
.
He
could
issue
no
warrant
*NL*
on
my
word
.
If
I
had
been
killed
in
the
presence
of
a
thousand
colored
*NL*
people
,
their
testimony
combined
would
have
been
insufficient
to
have
*NL*
arrested
one
of
the
murderers
.
Master
Hugh
,
for
once
,
was
compelled
to
*NL*
say
this
state
of
things
was
too
bad
.
Of
course
,
it
was
impossible
to
*NL*
get
any
white
man
to
volunteer
his
testimony
in
my
behalf
,
and
against
*NL*
the
white
young
men
.
Even
those
who
may
have
sympathized
with
me
were
*NL*
not
prepared
to
do
this
.
It
required
a
degree
of
courage
unknown
to
them
*NL*
to
do
so
;
for
just
at
that
time
,
the
slightest
manifestation
of
humanity
*NL*
toward
a
colored
person
was
denounced
as
abolitionism
,
and
that
name
*NL*
subjected
its
bearer
to
frightful
liabilities
.
The
watchwords
of
*NL*
the
bloody-minded
in
that
region
,
and
in
those
days
,
were
,
``
Damn
the
*NL*
abolitionists
!
''
and
``
Damn
the
niggers
!
''
There
was
nothing
done
,
and
*NL*
probably
nothing
would
have
been
done
if
I
had
been
killed
.
Such
*NL*
was
,
and
such
remains
,
the
state
of
things
in
the
Christian
city
of
*NL*
Baltimore
.
*NL*
*NL*
Master
Hugh
,
finding
he
could
get
no
redress
,
refused
to
let
me
go
back
*NL*
again
to
Mr.
Gardner
.
He
kept
me
himself
,
and
his
wife
dressed
my
wound
*NL*
till
I
was
again
restored
to
health
.
He
then
took
me
into
the
ship-yard
*NL*
of
which
he
was
foreman
,
in
the
employment
of
Mr.
Walter
Price
.
There
I
*NL*
was
immediately
set
to
calking
,
and
very
soon
learned
the
art
of
using
*NL*
my
mallet
and
irons
.
In
the
course
of
one
year
from
the
time
I
left
Mr.
*NL*
Gardner
's
,
I
was
able
to
command
the
highest
wages
given
to
the
most
*NL*
experienced
calkers
.
I
was
now
of
some
importance
to
my
master
.
I
was
*NL*
bringing
him
from
six
to
seven
dollars
per
week
.
I
sometimes
brought
him
*NL*
nine
dollars
per
week
:
my
wages
were
a
dollar
and
a
half
a
day
.
After
*NL*
learning
how
to
calk
,
I
sought
my
own
employment
,
made
my
own
contracts
,
*NL*
and
collected
the
money
which
I
earned
.
My
pathway
became
much
more
*NL*
smooth
than
before
;
my
condition
was
now
much
more
comfortable
.
When
I
*NL*
could
get
no
calking
to
do
,
I
did
nothing
.
During
these
leisure
times
,
*NL*
those
old
notions
about
freedom
would
steal
over
me
again
.
When
in
*NL*
Mr.
Gardner
's
employment
,
I
was
kept
in
such
a
perpetual
whirl
of
*NL*
excitement
,
I
could
think
of
nothing
,
scarcely
,
but
my
life
;
and
in
*NL*
thinking
of
my
life
,
I
almost
forgot
my
liberty
.
I
have
observed
this
*NL*
in
my
experience
of
slavery
,
--
that
whenever
my
condition
was
improved
,
*NL*
instead
of
its
increasing
my
contentment
,
it
only
increased
my
desire
*NL*
to
be
free
,
and
set
me
to
thinking
of
plans
to
gain
my
freedom
.
I
*NL*
have
found
that
,
to
make
a
contented
slave
,
it
is
necessary
to
make
a
*NL*
thoughtless
one
.
It
is
necessary
to
darken
his
moral
and
mental
vision
,
*NL*
and
,
as
far
as
possible
,
to
annihilate
the
power
of
reason
.
He
must
be
*NL*
able
to
detect
no
inconsistencies
in
slavery
;
he
must
be
made
to
feel
*NL*
that
slavery
is
right
;
and
he
can
be
brought
to
that
only
when
he
ceases
*NL*
to
be
a
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
now
getting
,
as
I
have
said
,
one
dollar
and
fifty
cents
per
day
.
I
*NL*
contracted
for
it
;
I
earned
it
;
it
was
paid
to
me
;
it
was
rightfully
my
*NL*
own
;
yet
,
upon
each
returning
Saturday
night
,
I
was
compelled
to
deliver
*NL*
every
cent
of
that
money
to
Master
Hugh
.
And
why
?
Not
because
he
earned
*NL*
it
,
--
not
because
he
had
any
hand
in
earning
it
,
--
not
because
I
owed
it
to
*NL*
him
,
--
nor
because
he
possessed
the
slightest
shadow
of
a
right
to
it
;
but
*NL*
solely
because
he
had
the
power
to
compel
me
to
give
it
up
.
The
right
of
*NL*
the
grim-visaged
pirate
upon
the
high
seas
is
exactly
the
same
.

CHAPTER
XI
*NL*
*NL*
I
now
come
to
that
part
of
my
life
during
which
I
planned
,
and
finally
*NL*
succeeded
in
making
,
my
escape
from
slavery
.
But
before
narrating
any
of
*NL*
the
peculiar
circumstances
,
I
deem
it
proper
to
make
known
my
intention
*NL*
not
to
state
all
the
facts
connected
with
the
transaction
.
My
reasons
*NL*
for
pursuing
this
course
may
be
understood
from
the
following
:
First
,
*NL*
were
I
to
give
a
minute
statement
of
all
the
facts
,
it
is
not
only
*NL*
possible
,
but
quite
probable
,
that
others
would
thereby
be
involved
in
*NL*
the
most
embarrassing
difficulties
.
Secondly
,
such
a
statement
would
*NL*
most
undoubtedly
induce
greater
vigilance
on
the
part
of
slaveholders
*NL*
than
has
existed
heretofore
among
them
;
which
would
,
of
course
,
be
the
*NL*
means
of
guarding
a
door
whereby
some
dear
brother
bondman
might
escape
*NL*
his
galling
chains
.
I
deeply
regret
the
necessity
that
impels
me
*NL*
to
suppress
any
thing
of
importance
connected
with
my
experience
in
*NL*
slavery
.
It
would
afford
me
great
pleasure
indeed
,
as
well
as
materially
*NL*
add
to
the
interest
of
my
narrative
,
were
I
at
liberty
to
gratify
a
*NL*
curiosity
,
which
I
know
exists
in
the
minds
of
many
,
by
an
accurate
*NL*
statement
of
all
the
facts
pertaining
to
my
most
fortunate
escape
.
But
*NL*
I
must
deprive
myself
of
this
pleasure
,
and
the
curious
of
the
*NL*
gratification
which
such
a
statement
would
afford
.
I
would
allow
myself
*NL*
to
suffer
under
the
greatest
imputations
which
evil-minded
men
might
*NL*
suggest
,
rather
than
exculpate
myself
,
and
thereby
run
the
hazard
*NL*
of
closing
the
slightest
avenue
by
which
a
brother
slave
might
clear
*NL*
himself
of
the
chains
and
fetters
of
slavery
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
never
approved
of
the
very
public
manner
in
which
some
of
*NL*
our
western
friends
have
conducted
what
they
call
the
_
underground
*NL*
railroad
,
_
but
which
I
think
,
by
their
open
declarations
,
has
been
made
*NL*
most
emphatically
the
_
upper-ground
railroad
.
_
I
honor
those
good
*NL*
men
and
women
for
their
noble
daring
,
and
applaud
them
for
willingly
*NL*
subjecting
themselves
to
bloody
persecution
,
by
openly
avowing
their
*NL*
participation
in
the
escape
of
slaves
.
I
,
however
,
can
see
very
little
*NL*
good
resulting
from
such
a
course
,
either
to
themselves
or
the
slaves
*NL*
escaping
;
while
,
upon
the
other
hand
,
I
see
and
feel
assured
that
those
*NL*
open
declarations
are
a
positive
evil
to
the
slaves
remaining
,
who
*NL*
are
seeking
to
escape
.
They
do
nothing
towards
enlightening
the
slave
,
*NL*
whilst
they
do
much
towards
enlightening
the
master
.
They
stimulate
him
*NL*
to
greater
watchfulness
,
and
enhance
his
power
to
capture
his
slave
.
We
*NL*
owe
something
to
the
slave
south
of
the
line
as
well
as
to
those
north
*NL*
of
it
;
and
in
aiding
the
latter
on
their
way
to
freedom
,
we
should
be
*NL*
careful
to
do
nothing
which
would
be
likely
to
hinder
the
former
from
*NL*
escaping
from
slavery
.
I
would
keep
the
merciless
slaveholder
profoundly
*NL*
ignorant
of
the
means
of
flight
adopted
by
the
slave
.
I
would
leave
him
*NL*
to
imagine
himself
surrounded
by
myriads
of
invisible
tormentors
,
ever
*NL*
ready
to
snatch
from
his
infernal
grasp
his
trembling
prey
.
Let
him
be
*NL*
left
to
feel
his
way
in
the
dark
;
let
darkness
commensurate
with
his
*NL*
crime
hover
over
him
;
and
let
him
feel
that
at
every
step
he
takes
,
*NL*
in
pursuit
of
the
flying
bondman
,
he
is
running
the
frightful
risk
of
*NL*
having
his
hot
brains
dashed
out
by
an
invisible
agency
.
Let
us
render
*NL*
the
tyrant
no
aid
;
let
us
not
hold
the
light
by
which
he
can
trace
the
*NL*
footprints
of
our
flying
brother
.
But
enough
of
this
.
I
will
now
proceed
*NL*
to
the
statement
of
those
facts
,
connected
with
my
escape
,
for
which
*NL*
I
am
alone
responsible
,
and
for
which
no
one
can
be
made
to
suffer
but
*NL*
myself
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
early
part
of
the
year
1838
,
I
became
quite
restless
.
I
could
see
*NL*
no
reason
why
I
should
,
at
the
end
of
each
week
,
pour
the
reward
of
my
*NL*
toil
into
the
purse
of
my
master
.
When
I
carried
to
him
my
weekly
*NL*
wages
,
he
would
,
after
counting
the
money
,
look
me
in
the
face
with
a
*NL*
robber-like
fierceness
,
and
ask
,
``
Is
this
all
?
''
He
was
satisfied
with
*NL*
nothing
less
than
the
last
cent
.
He
would
,
however
,
when
I
made
him
*NL*
six
dollars
,
sometimes
give
me
six
cents
,
to
encourage
me
.
It
had
the
*NL*
opposite
effect
.
I
regarded
it
as
a
sort
of
admission
of
my
right
to
the
*NL*
whole
.
The
fact
that
he
gave
me
any
part
of
my
wages
was
proof
,
to
my
*NL*
mind
,
that
he
believed
me
entitled
to
the
whole
of
them
.
I
always
felt
*NL*
worse
for
having
received
any
thing
;
for
I
feared
that
the
giving
me
a
*NL*
few
cents
would
ease
his
conscience
,
and
make
him
feel
himself
to
be
a
*NL*
pretty
honorable
sort
of
robber
.
My
discontent
grew
upon
me
.
I
was
ever
*NL*
on
the
look-out
for
means
of
escape
;
and
,
finding
no
direct
means
,
I
*NL*
determined
to
try
to
hire
my
time
,
with
a
view
of
getting
money
with
*NL*
which
to
make
my
escape
.
In
the
spring
of
1838
,
when
Master
Thomas
came
*NL*
to
Baltimore
to
purchase
his
spring
goods
,
I
got
an
opportunity
,
and
*NL*
applied
to
him
to
allow
me
to
hire
my
time
.
He
unhesitatingly
refused
my
*NL*
request
,
and
told
me
this
was
another
stratagem
by
which
to
escape
.
He
*NL*
told
me
I
could
go
nowhere
but
that
he
could
get
me
;
and
that
,
in
the
*NL*
event
of
my
running
away
,
he
should
spare
no
pains
in
his
efforts
to
*NL*
catch
me
.
He
exhorted
me
to
content
myself
,
and
be
obedient
.
He
told
me
,
*NL*
if
I
would
be
happy
,
I
must
lay
out
no
plans
for
the
future
.
He
said
,
if
*NL*
I
behaved
myself
properly
,
he
would
take
care
of
me
.
Indeed
,
he
advised
*NL*
me
to
complete
thoughtlessness
of
the
future
,
and
taught
me
to
depend
*NL*
solely
upon
him
for
happiness
.
He
seemed
to
see
fully
the
pressing
*NL*
necessity
of
setting
aside
my
intellectual
nature
,
in
order
to
*NL*
contentment
in
slavery
.
But
in
spite
of
him
,
and
even
in
spite
of
*NL*
myself
,
I
continued
to
think
,
and
to
think
about
the
injustice
of
my
*NL*
enslavement
,
and
the
means
of
escape
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
two
months
after
this
,
I
applied
to
Master
Hugh
for
the
privilege
*NL*
of
hiring
my
time
.
He
was
not
acquainted
with
the
fact
that
I
had
*NL*
applied
to
Master
Thomas
,
and
had
been
refused
.
He
too
,
at
first
,
*NL*
seemed
disposed
to
refuse
;
but
,
after
some
reflection
,
he
granted
me
the
*NL*
privilege
,
and
proposed
the
following
terms
:
I
was
to
be
allowed
all
my
*NL*
time
,
make
all
contracts
with
those
for
whom
I
worked
,
and
find
my
own
*NL*
employment
;
and
,
in
return
for
this
liberty
,
I
was
to
pay
him
three
*NL*
dollars
at
the
end
of
each
week
;
find
myself
in
calking
tools
,
and
in
*NL*
board
and
clothing
.
My
board
was
two
dollars
and
a
half
per
week
.
This
,
*NL*
with
the
wear
and
tear
of
clothing
and
calking
tools
,
made
my
regular
*NL*
expenses
about
six
dollars
per
week
.
This
amount
I
was
compelled
to
make
*NL*
up
,
or
relinquish
the
privilege
of
hiring
my
time
.
Rain
or
shine
,
work
*NL*
or
no
work
,
at
the
end
of
each
week
the
money
must
be
forthcoming
,
or
I
*NL*
must
give
up
my
privilege
.
This
arrangement
,
it
will
be
perceived
,
was
*NL*
decidedly
in
my
master
's
favor
.
It
relieved
him
of
all
need
of
*NL*
looking
after
me
.
His
money
was
sure
.
He
received
all
the
benefits
*NL*
of
slaveholding
without
its
evils
;
while
I
endured
all
the
evils
of
a
*NL*
slave
,
and
suffered
all
the
care
and
anxiety
of
a
freeman
.
I
found
it
a
*NL*
hard
bargain
.
But
,
hard
as
it
was
,
I
thought
it
better
than
the
old
mode
*NL*
of
getting
along
.
It
was
a
step
towards
freedom
to
be
allowed
to
bear
*NL*
the
responsibilities
of
a
freeman
,
and
I
was
determined
to
hold
on
upon
*NL*
it
.
I
bent
myself
to
the
work
of
making
money
.
I
was
ready
to
work
*NL*
at
night
as
well
as
day
,
and
by
the
most
untiring
perseverance
and
*NL*
industry
,
I
made
enough
to
meet
my
expenses
,
and
lay
up
a
little
money
*NL*
every
week
.
I
went
on
thus
from
May
till
August
.
Master
Hugh
then
*NL*
refused
to
allow
me
to
hire
my
time
longer
.
The
ground
for
his
refusal
*NL*
was
a
failure
on
my
part
,
one
Saturday
night
,
to
pay
him
for
my
week
's
*NL*
time
.
This
failure
was
occasioned
by
my
attending
a
camp
meeting
*NL*
about
ten
miles
from
Baltimore
.
During
the
week
,
I
had
entered
into
an
*NL*
engagement
with
a
number
of
young
friends
to
start
from
Baltimore
to
the
*NL*
camp
ground
early
Saturday
evening
;
and
being
detained
by
my
employer
,
*NL*
I
was
unable
to
get
down
to
Master
Hugh
's
without
disappointing
the
*NL*
company
.
I
knew
that
Master
Hugh
was
in
no
special
need
of
the
money
*NL*
that
night
.
I
therefore
decided
to
go
to
camp
meeting
,
and
upon
my
*NL*
return
pay
him
the
three
dollars
.
I
staid
at
the
camp
meeting
one
day
*NL*
longer
than
I
intended
when
I
left
.
But
as
soon
as
I
returned
,
I
called
*NL*
upon
him
to
pay
him
what
he
considered
his
due
.
I
found
him
very
angry
;
*NL*
he
could
scarce
restrain
his
wrath
.
He
said
he
had
a
great
mind
to
give
*NL*
me
a
severe
whipping
.
He
wished
to
know
how
I
dared
go
out
of
the
city
*NL*
without
asking
his
permission
.
I
told
him
I
hired
my
time
and
while
*NL*
I
paid
him
the
price
which
he
asked
for
it
,
I
did
not
know
that
I
was
*NL*
bound
to
ask
him
when
and
where
I
should
go
.
This
reply
troubled
him
;
*NL*
and
,
after
reflecting
a
few
moments
,
he
turned
to
me
,
and
said
I
should
*NL*
hire
my
time
no
longer
;
that
the
next
thing
he
should
know
of
,
I
would
*NL*
be
running
away
.
Upon
the
same
plea
,
he
told
me
to
bring
my
tools
and
*NL*
clothing
home
forthwith
.
I
did
so
;
but
instead
of
seeking
work
,
as
I
had
*NL*
been
accustomed
to
do
previously
to
hiring
my
time
,
I
spent
the
whole
*NL*
week
without
the
performance
of
a
single
stroke
of
work
.
I
did
this
in
*NL*
retaliation
.
Saturday
night
,
he
called
upon
me
as
usual
for
my
week
's
*NL*
wages
.
I
told
him
I
had
no
wages
;
I
had
done
no
work
that
week
.
Here
*NL*
we
were
upon
the
point
of
coming
to
blows
.
He
raved
,
and
swore
his
*NL*
determination
to
get
hold
of
me
.
I
did
not
allow
myself
a
single
word
;
*NL*
but
was
resolved
,
if
he
laid
the
weight
of
his
hand
upon
me
,
it
should
*NL*
be
blow
for
blow
.
He
did
not
strike
me
,
but
told
me
that
he
would
find
*NL*
me
in
constant
employment
in
future
.
I
thought
the
matter
over
during
*NL*
the
next
day
,
Sunday
,
and
finally
resolved
upon
the
third
day
of
*NL*
September
,
as
the
day
upon
which
I
would
make
a
second
attempt
to
*NL*
secure
my
freedom
.
I
now
had
three
weeks
during
which
to
prepare
for
my
*NL*
journey
.
Early
on
Monday
morning
,
before
Master
Hugh
had
time
to
make
*NL*
any
engagement
for
me
,
I
went
out
and
got
employment
of
Mr.
Butler
,
at
*NL*
his
ship-yard
near
the
drawbridge
,
upon
what
is
called
the
City
Block
,
*NL*
thus
making
it
unnecessary
for
him
to
seek
employment
for
me
.
At
the
*NL*
end
of
the
week
,
I
brought
him
between
eight
and
nine
dollars
.
He
seemed
*NL*
very
well
pleased
,
and
asked
why
I
did
not
do
the
same
the
week
before
.
*NL*
He
little
knew
what
my
plans
were
.
My
object
in
working
steadily
was
to
*NL*
remove
any
suspicion
he
might
entertain
of
my
intent
to
run
away
;
and
*NL*
in
this
I
succeeded
admirably
.
I
suppose
he
thought
I
was
never
better
*NL*
satisfied
with
my
condition
than
at
the
very
time
during
which
I
was
*NL*
planning
my
escape
.
The
second
week
passed
,
and
again
I
carried
him
*NL*
my
full
wages
;
and
so
well
pleased
was
he
,
that
he
gave
me
twenty-five
*NL*
cents
,
-LRB-
quite
a
large
sum
for
a
slaveholder
to
give
a
slave
,
-RRB-
and
bade
*NL*
me
to
make
a
good
use
of
it
.
I
told
him
I
would
.
*NL*
*NL*
Things
went
on
without
very
smoothly
indeed
,
but
within
there
was
*NL*
trouble
.
It
is
impossible
for
me
to
describe
my
feelings
as
the
time
of
*NL*
my
contemplated
start
drew
near
.
I
had
a
number
of
warmhearted
friends
*NL*
in
Baltimore
,
--
friends
that
I
loved
almost
as
I
did
my
life
,
--
and
*NL*
the
thought
of
being
separated
from
them
forever
was
painful
beyond
*NL*
expression
.
It
is
my
opinion
that
thousands
would
escape
from
slavery
,
*NL*
who
now
remain
,
but
for
the
strong
cords
of
affection
that
bind
them
to
*NL*
their
friends
.
The
thought
of
leaving
my
friends
was
decidedly
the
most
*NL*
painful
thought
with
which
I
had
to
contend
.
The
love
of
them
was
my
*NL*
tender
point
,
and
shook
my
decision
more
than
all
things
else
.
Besides
*NL*
the
pain
of
separation
,
the
dread
and
apprehension
of
a
failure
exceeded
*NL*
what
I
had
experienced
at
my
first
attempt
.
The
appalling
defeat
I
then
*NL*
sustained
returned
to
torment
me
.
I
felt
assured
that
,
if
I
failed
in
*NL*
this
attempt
,
my
case
would
be
a
hopeless
one
--
it
would
seal
my
fate
as
a
*NL*
slave
forever
.
I
could
not
hope
to
get
off
with
any
thing
less
than
the
*NL*
severest
punishment
,
and
being
placed
beyond
the
means
of
escape
.
It
*NL*
required
no
very
vivid
imagination
to
depict
the
most
frightful
scenes
*NL*
through
which
I
should
have
to
pass
,
in
case
I
failed
.
The
wretchedness
*NL*
of
slavery
,
and
the
blessedness
of
freedom
,
were
perpetually
before
me
.
*NL*
It
was
life
and
death
with
me
.
But
I
remained
firm
,
and
,
according
to
my
*NL*
resolution
,
on
the
third
day
of
September
,
1838
,
I
left
my
chains
,
and
*NL*
succeeded
in
reaching
New
York
without
the
slightest
interruption
of
any
*NL*
kind
.
How
I
did
so
,
--
what
means
I
adopted
,
--
what
direction
I
travelled
,
*NL*
and
by
what
mode
of
conveyance
,
--
I
must
leave
unexplained
,
for
the
*NL*
reasons
before
mentioned
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
been
frequently
asked
how
I
felt
when
I
found
myself
in
a
*NL*
free
State
.
I
have
never
been
able
to
answer
the
question
with
any
*NL*
satisfaction
to
myself
.
It
was
a
moment
of
the
highest
excitement
I
ever
*NL*
experienced
.
I
suppose
I
felt
as
one
may
imagine
the
unarmed
mariner
to
*NL*
feel
when
he
is
rescued
by
a
friendly
man-of-war
from
the
pursuit
of
a
*NL*
pirate
.
In
writing
to
a
dear
friend
,
immediately
after
my
arrival
at
New
*NL*
York
,
I
said
I
felt
like
one
who
had
escaped
a
den
of
hungry
lions
.
This
*NL*
state
of
mind
,
however
,
very
soon
subsided
;
and
I
was
again
seized
with
*NL*
a
feeling
of
great
insecurity
and
loneliness
.
I
was
yet
liable
to
be
*NL*
taken
back
,
and
subjected
to
all
the
tortures
of
slavery
.
This
in
*NL*
itself
was
enough
to
damp
the
ardor
of
my
enthusiasm
.
But
the
loneliness
*NL*
overcame
me
.
There
I
was
in
the
midst
of
thousands
,
and
yet
a
perfect
*NL*
stranger
;
without
home
and
without
friends
,
in
the
midst
of
thousands
*NL*
of
my
own
brethren
--
children
of
a
common
Father
,
and
yet
I
dared
not
to
*NL*
unfold
to
any
one
of
them
my
sad
condition
.
I
was
afraid
to
speak
to
any
*NL*
one
for
fear
of
speaking
to
the
wrong
one
,
and
thereby
falling
into
the
*NL*
hands
of
money-loving
kidnappers
,
whose
business
it
was
to
lie
in
wait
*NL*
for
the
panting
fugitive
,
as
the
ferocious
beasts
of
the
forest
lie
*NL*
in
wait
for
their
prey
.
The
motto
which
I
adopted
when
I
started
from
*NL*
slavery
was
this
--
``
Trust
no
man
!
''
I
saw
in
every
white
man
an
enemy
,
and
*NL*
in
almost
every
colored
man
cause
for
distrust
.
It
was
a
most
painful
*NL*
situation
;
and
,
to
understand
it
,
one
must
needs
experience
it
,
or
*NL*
imagine
himself
in
similar
circumstances
.
Let
him
be
a
fugitive
slave
*NL*
in
a
strange
land
--
a
land
given
up
to
be
the
hunting-ground
for
*NL*
slaveholders
--
whose
inhabitants
are
legalized
kidnappers
--
where
he
is
*NL*
every
moment
subjected
to
the
terrible
liability
of
being
seized
upon
by
*NL*
his
fellowmen
,
as
the
hideous
crocodile
seizes
upon
his
prey
!
--
I
say
,
let
*NL*
him
place
himself
in
my
situation
--
without
home
or
friends
--
without
money
*NL*
or
credit
--
wanting
shelter
,
and
no
one
to
give
it
--
wanting
bread
,
and
no
*NL*
money
to
buy
it
,
--
and
at
the
same
time
let
him
feel
that
he
is
pursued
by
*NL*
merciless
men-hunters
,
and
in
total
darkness
as
to
what
to
do
,
where
to
*NL*
go
,
or
where
to
stay
,
--
perfectly
helpless
both
as
to
the
means
of
defence
*NL*
and
means
of
escape
,
--
in
the
midst
of
plenty
,
yet
suffering
the
terrible
*NL*
gnawings
of
hunger
,
--
in
the
midst
of
houses
,
yet
having
no
home
,
--
among
*NL*
fellow-men
,
yet
feeling
as
if
in
the
midst
of
wild
beasts
,
whose
*NL*
greediness
to
swallow
up
the
trembling
and
half-famished
fugitive
is
*NL*
only
equalled
by
that
with
which
the
monsters
of
the
deep
swallow
up
the
*NL*
helpless
fish
upon
which
they
subsist
,
--
I
say
,
let
him
be
placed
in
this
*NL*
most
trying
situation
,
--
the
situation
in
which
I
was
placed
,
--
then
,
and
*NL*
not
till
then
,
will
he
fully
appreciate
the
hardships
of
,
and
know
how
*NL*
to
sympathize
with
,
the
toil-worn
and
whip-scarred
fugitive
slave
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thank
Heaven
,
I
remained
but
a
short
time
in
this
distressed
situation
.
*NL*
I
was
relieved
from
it
by
the
humane
hand
of
_
Mr.
David
Ruggles
_
,
whose
*NL*
vigilance
,
kindness
,
and
perseverance
,
I
shall
never
forget
.
I
am
*NL*
glad
of
an
opportunity
to
express
,
as
far
as
words
can
,
the
love
and
*NL*
gratitude
I
bear
him
.
Mr.
Ruggles
is
now
afflicted
with
blindness
,
and
*NL*
is
himself
in
need
of
the
same
kind
offices
which
he
was
once
so
forward
*NL*
in
the
performance
of
toward
others
.
I
had
been
in
New
York
but
a
few
*NL*
days
,
when
Mr.
Ruggles
sought
me
out
,
and
very
kindly
took
me
to
his
*NL*
boarding-house
at
the
corner
of
Church
and
Lespenard
Streets
.
Mr.
*NL*
Ruggles
was
then
very
deeply
engaged
in
the
memorable
_
Darg
_
case
,
as
*NL*
well
as
attending
to
a
number
of
other
fugitive
slaves
,
devising
ways
*NL*
and
means
for
their
successful
escape
;
and
,
though
watched
and
hemmed
in
*NL*
on
almost
every
side
,
he
seemed
to
be
more
than
a
match
for
his
enemies
.
*NL*
*NL*
Very
soon
after
I
went
to
Mr.
Ruggles
,
he
wished
to
know
of
me
where
*NL*
I
wanted
to
go
;
as
he
deemed
it
unsafe
for
me
to
remain
in
New
York
.
I
*NL*
told
him
I
was
a
calker
,
and
should
like
to
go
where
I
could
get
work
.
*NL*
I
thought
of
going
to
Canada
;
but
he
decided
against
it
,
and
in
favor
of
*NL*
my
going
to
New
Bedford
,
thinking
I
should
be
able
to
get
work
there
at
*NL*
my
trade
.
At
this
time
,
Anna
,
*
my
intended
wife
,
came
on
;
for
I
wrote
*NL*
to
her
immediately
after
my
arrival
at
New
York
,
-LRB-
notwithstanding
*NL*
my
homeless
,
houseless
,
and
helpless
condition
,
-RRB-
informing
her
of
my
*NL*
successful
flight
,
and
wishing
her
to
come
on
forthwith
.
In
a
few
days
*NL*
after
her
arrival
,
Mr.
Ruggles
called
in
the
Rev.
J.
W.
C.
Pennington
,
*NL*
who
,
in
the
presence
of
Mr.
Ruggles
,
Mrs.
Michaels
,
and
two
or
three
*NL*
others
,
performed
the
marriage
ceremony
,
and
gave
us
a
certificate
,
of
*NL*
which
the
following
is
an
exact
copy
:

I
had
changed
my
name
from
Frederick
_
Bailey
_
to
that
of
*NL*
_
Johnson
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
Upon
receiving
this
certificate
,
and
a
five-dollar
bill
from
Mr.
*NL*
Ruggles
,
I
shouldered
one
part
of
our
baggage
,
and
Anna
took
up
*NL*
the
other
,
and
we
set
out
forthwith
to
take
passage
on
board
of
the
*NL*
steamboat
John
W.
Richmond
for
Newport
,
on
our
way
to
New
Bedford
.
Mr.
*NL*
Ruggles
gave
me
a
letter
to
a
Mr.
Shaw
in
Newport
,
and
told
me
,
in
case
*NL*
my
money
did
not
serve
me
to
New
Bedford
,
to
stop
in
Newport
and
obtain
*NL*
further
assistance
;
but
upon
our
arrival
at
Newport
,
we
were
so
anxious
*NL*
to
get
to
a
place
of
safety
,
that
,
notwithstanding
we
lacked
the
*NL*
necessary
money
to
pay
our
fare
,
we
decided
to
take
seats
in
the
stage
,
*NL*
and
promise
to
pay
when
we
got
to
New
Bedford
.
We
were
encouraged
to
do
*NL*
this
by
two
excellent
gentlemen
,
residents
of
New
Bedford
,
whose
names
I
*NL*
afterward
ascertained
to
be
Joseph
Ricketson
and
William
C.
Taber
.
*NL*
They
seemed
at
once
to
understand
our
circumstances
,
and
gave
us
*NL*
such
assurance
of
their
friendliness
as
put
us
fully
at
ease
in
their
*NL*
presence
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
good
indeed
to
meet
with
such
friends
,
at
such
a
time
.
Upon
*NL*
reaching
New
Bedford
,
we
were
directed
to
the
house
of
Mr.
Nathan
*NL*
Johnson
,
by
whom
we
were
kindly
received
,
and
hospitably
provided
*NL*
for
.
Both
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Johnson
took
a
deep
and
lively
interest
in
*NL*
our
welfare
.
They
proved
themselves
quite
worthy
of
the
name
of
*NL*
abolitionists
.
When
the
stage-driver
found
us
unable
to
pay
our
fare
,
he
*NL*
held
on
upon
our
baggage
as
security
for
the
debt
.
I
had
but
to
mention
*NL*
the
fact
to
Mr.
Johnson
,
and
he
forthwith
advanced
the
money
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
now
began
to
feel
a
degree
of
safety
,
and
to
prepare
ourselves
for
*NL*
the
duties
and
responsibilities
of
a
life
of
freedom
.
On
the
morning
*NL*
after
our
arrival
at
New
Bedford
,
while
at
the
breakfast-table
,
the
*NL*
question
arose
as
to
what
name
I
should
be
called
by
.
The
name
given
me
*NL*
by
my
mother
was
,
``
Frederick
Augustus
Washington
Bailey
.
''
I
,
however
,
*NL*
had
dispensed
with
the
two
middle
names
long
before
I
left
Maryland
so
*NL*
that
I
was
generally
known
by
the
name
of
``
Frederick
Bailey
.
''
I
started
*NL*
from
Baltimore
bearing
the
name
of
``
Stanley
.
''
When
I
got
to
New
York
,
I
*NL*
again
changed
my
name
to
``
Frederick
Johnson
,
''
and
thought
that
would
*NL*
be
the
last
change
.
But
when
I
got
to
New
Bedford
,
I
found
it
necessary
*NL*
again
to
change
my
name
.
The
reason
of
this
necessity
was
,
that
there
*NL*
were
so
many
Johnsons
in
New
Bedford
,
it
was
already
quite
difficult
to
*NL*
distinguish
between
them
.
I
gave
Mr.
Johnson
the
privilege
of
*NL*
choosing
me
a
name
,
but
told
him
he
must
not
take
from
me
the
name
of
*NL*
``
Frederick
.
''
I
must
hold
on
to
that
,
to
preserve
a
sense
of
my
identity
.
*NL*
Mr.
Johnson
had
just
been
reading
the
``
Lady
of
the
Lake
,
''
and
at
once
*NL*
suggested
that
my
name
be
``
Douglass
.
''
From
that
time
until
now
I
have
*NL*
been
called
``
Frederick
Douglass
;
''
and
as
I
am
more
widely
known
by
that
*NL*
name
than
by
either
of
the
others
,
I
shall
continue
to
use
it
as
my
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
quite
disappointed
at
the
general
appearance
of
things
in
New
*NL*
Bedford
.
The
impression
which
I
had
received
respecting
the
character
*NL*
and
condition
of
the
people
of
the
north
,
I
found
to
be
singularly
*NL*
erroneous
.
I
had
very
strangely
supposed
,
while
in
slavery
,
that
few
of
*NL*
the
comforts
,
and
scarcely
any
of
the
luxuries
,
of
life
were
enjoyed
at
*NL*
the
north
,
compared
with
what
were
enjoyed
by
the
slaveholders
of
the
*NL*
south
.
I
probably
came
to
this
conclusion
from
the
fact
that
northern
*NL*
people
owned
no
slaves
.
I
supposed
that
they
were
about
upon
a
level
*NL*
with
the
non-slaveholding
population
of
the
south
.
I
knew
_
they
_
were
*NL*
exceedingly
poor
,
and
I
had
been
accustomed
to
regard
their
poverty
as
*NL*
the
necessary
consequence
of
their
being
non-slaveholders
.
I
had
somehow
*NL*
imbibed
the
opinion
that
,
in
the
absence
of
slaves
,
there
could
be
no
*NL*
wealth
,
and
very
little
refinement
.
And
upon
coming
to
the
north
,
I
*NL*
expected
to
meet
with
a
rough
,
hard-handed
,
and
uncultivated
population
,
*NL*
living
in
the
most
Spartan-like
simplicity
,
knowing
nothing
of
the
*NL*
ease
,
luxury
,
pomp
,
and
grandeur
of
southern
slaveholders
.
Such
being
my
*NL*
conjectures
,
any
one
acquainted
with
the
appearance
of
New
Bedford
may
*NL*
very
readily
infer
how
palpably
I
must
have
seen
my
mistake
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
afternoon
of
the
day
when
I
reached
New
Bedford
,
I
visited
the
*NL*
wharves
,
to
take
a
view
of
the
shipping
.
Here
I
found
myself
surrounded
*NL*
with
the
strongest
proofs
of
wealth
.
Lying
at
the
wharves
,
and
riding
in
*NL*
the
stream
,
I
saw
many
ships
of
the
finest
model
,
in
the
best
order
,
and
*NL*
of
the
largest
size
.
Upon
the
right
and
left
,
I
was
walled
in
by
granite
*NL*
warehouses
of
the
widest
dimensions
,
stowed
to
their
utmost
capacity
*NL*
with
the
necessaries
and
comforts
of
life
.
Added
to
this
,
almost
every
*NL*
body
seemed
to
be
at
work
,
but
noiselessly
so
,
compared
with
what
I
had
*NL*
been
accustomed
to
in
Baltimore
.
There
were
no
loud
songs
heard
from
*NL*
those
engaged
in
loading
and
unloading
ships
.
I
heard
no
deep
oaths
or
*NL*
horrid
curses
on
the
laborer
.
I
saw
no
whipping
of
men
;
but
all
seemed
*NL*
to
go
smoothly
on
.
Every
man
appeared
to
understand
his
work
,
and
went
*NL*
at
it
with
a
sober
,
yet
cheerful
earnestness
,
which
betokened
the
deep
*NL*
interest
which
he
felt
in
what
he
was
doing
,
as
well
as
a
sense
of
his
*NL*
own
dignity
as
a
man
.
To
me
this
looked
exceedingly
strange
.
From
the
*NL*
wharves
I
strolled
around
and
over
the
town
,
gazing
with
wonder
*NL*
and
admiration
at
the
splendid
churches
,
beautiful
dwellings
,
and
*NL*
finely-cultivated
gardens
;
evincing
an
amount
of
wealth
,
comfort
,
taste
,
*NL*
and
refinement
,
such
as
I
had
never
seen
in
any
part
of
slaveholding
*NL*
Maryland
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
thing
looked
clean
,
new
,
and
beautiful
.
I
saw
few
or
no
*NL*
dilapidated
houses
,
with
poverty-stricken
inmates
;
no
half-naked
*NL*
children
and
barefooted
women
,
such
as
I
had
been
accustomed
to
see
in
*NL*
Hillsborough
,
Easton
,
St.
Michael
's
,
and
Baltimore
.
The
people
looked
*NL*
more
able
,
stronger
,
healthier
,
and
happier
,
than
those
of
Maryland
.
*NL*
I
was
for
once
made
glad
by
a
view
of
extreme
wealth
,
without
being
*NL*
saddened
by
seeing
extreme
poverty
.
But
the
most
astonishing
as
well
*NL*
as
the
most
interesting
thing
to
me
was
the
condition
of
the
colored
*NL*
people
,
a
great
many
of
whom
,
like
myself
,
had
escaped
thither
as
a
*NL*
refuge
from
the
hunters
of
men
.
I
found
many
,
who
had
not
been
seven
*NL*
years
out
of
their
chains
,
living
in
finer
houses
,
and
evidently
*NL*
enjoying
more
of
the
comforts
of
life
,
than
the
average
of
slaveholders
*NL*
in
Maryland
.
I
will
venture
to
assert
,
that
my
friend
Mr.
Nathan
Johnson
*NL*
-LRB-
of
whom
I
can
say
with
a
grateful
heart
,
``
I
was
hungry
,
and
he
gave
me
*NL*
meat
;
I
was
thirsty
,
and
he
gave
me
drink
;
I
was
a
stranger
,
and
he
took
*NL*
me
in
''
-RRB-
lived
in
a
neater
house
;
dined
at
a
better
table
;
took
,
paid
*NL*
for
,
and
read
,
more
newspapers
;
better
understood
the
moral
,
religious
,
*NL*
and
political
character
of
the
nation
,
--
than
nine
tenths
of
the
*NL*
slaveholders
in
Talbot
county
Maryland
.
Yet
Mr.
Johnson
was
a
working
*NL*
man
.
His
hands
were
hardened
by
toil
,
and
not
his
alone
,
but
those
also
*NL*
of
Mrs.
Johnson
.
I
found
the
colored
people
much
more
spirited
than
*NL*
I
had
supposed
they
would
be
.
I
found
among
them
a
determination
to
*NL*
protect
each
other
from
the
blood-thirsty
kidnapper
,
at
all
hazards
.
*NL*
Soon
after
my
arrival
,
I
was
told
of
a
circumstance
which
illustrated
*NL*
their
spirit
.
A
colored
man
and
a
fugitive
slave
were
on
unfriendly
*NL*
terms
.
The
former
was
heard
to
threaten
the
latter
with
informing
his
*NL*
master
of
his
whereabouts
.
Straightway
a
meeting
was
called
among
the
*NL*
colored
people
,
under
the
stereotyped
notice
,
``
Business
of
importance
!
''
*NL*
The
betrayer
was
invited
to
attend
.
The
people
came
at
the
appointed
*NL*
hour
,
and
organized
the
meeting
by
appointing
a
very
religious
old
*NL*
gentleman
as
president
,
who
,
I
believe
,
made
a
prayer
,
after
which
he
*NL*
addressed
the
meeting
as
follows
:
''
_
Friends
,
we
have
got
him
here
,
and
*NL*
I
would
recommend
that
you
young
men
just
take
him
outside
the
door
,
*NL*
and
kill
him
!
_
''
With
this
,
a
number
of
them
bolted
at
him
;
but
they
were
*NL*
intercepted
by
some
more
timid
than
themselves
,
and
the
betrayer
escaped
*NL*
their
vengeance
,
and
has
not
been
seen
in
New
Bedford
since
.
I
believe
*NL*
there
have
been
no
more
such
threats
,
and
should
there
be
hereafter
,
I
*NL*
doubt
not
that
death
would
be
the
consequence
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
found
employment
,
the
third
day
after
my
arrival
,
in
stowing
a
sloop
*NL*
with
a
load
of
oil
.
It
was
new
,
dirty
,
and
hard
work
for
me
;
but
I
went
*NL*
at
it
with
a
glad
heart
and
a
willing
hand
.
I
was
now
my
own
master
.
It
*NL*
was
a
happy
moment
,
the
rapture
of
which
can
be
understood
only
by
those
*NL*
who
have
been
slaves
.
It
was
the
first
work
,
the
reward
of
which
was
to
*NL*
be
entirely
my
own
.
There
was
no
Master
Hugh
standing
ready
,
the
moment
*NL*
I
earned
the
money
,
to
rob
me
of
it
.
I
worked
that
day
with
a
pleasure
I
*NL*
had
never
before
experienced
.
I
was
at
work
for
myself
and
newly-married
*NL*
wife
.
It
was
to
me
the
starting-point
of
a
new
existence
.
When
I
got
*NL*
through
with
that
job
,
I
went
in
pursuit
of
a
job
of
calking
;
but
such
*NL*
was
the
strength
of
prejudice
against
color
,
among
the
white
calkers
,
*NL*
that
they
refused
to
work
with
me
,
and
of
course
I
could
get
no
*NL*
employment
.
*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
I
am
told
that
colored
persons
can
now
get
employment
at
*NL*
calking
in
New
Bedford
--
a
result
of
anti-slavery
effort
.
*NL*
*NL*
Finding
my
trade
of
no
immediate
benefit
,
I
threw
off
my
calking
*NL*
habiliments
,
and
prepared
myself
to
do
any
kind
of
work
I
could
get
to
*NL*
do
.
Mr.
Johnson
kindly
let
me
have
his
wood-horse
and
saw
,
and
I
very
*NL*
soon
found
myself
a
plenty
of
work
.
There
was
no
work
too
hard
--
none
*NL*
too
dirty
.
I
was
ready
to
saw
wood
,
shovel
coal
,
carry
wood
,
sweep
the
*NL*
chimney
,
or
roll
oil
casks
,
--
all
of
which
I
did
for
nearly
three
years
in
*NL*
New
Bedford
,
before
I
became
known
to
the
anti-slavery
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
about
four
months
after
I
went
to
New
Bedford
,
there
came
a
young
man
*NL*
to
me
,
and
inquired
if
I
did
not
wish
to
take
the
``
Liberator
.
''
I
told
*NL*
him
I
did
;
but
,
just
having
made
my
escape
from
slavery
,
I
remarked
that
*NL*
I
was
unable
to
pay
for
it
then
.
I
,
however
,
finally
became
a
subscriber
*NL*
to
it
.
The
paper
came
,
and
I
read
it
from
week
to
week
with
such
*NL*
feelings
as
it
would
be
quite
idle
for
me
to
attempt
to
describe
.
The
*NL*
paper
became
my
meat
and
my
drink
.
My
soul
was
set
all
on
fire
.
*NL*
Its
sympathy
for
my
brethren
in
bonds
--
its
scathing
denunciations
of
*NL*
slaveholders
--
its
faithful
exposures
of
slavery
--
and
its
powerful
attacks
*NL*
upon
the
upholders
of
the
institution
--
sent
a
thrill
of
joy
through
my
*NL*
soul
,
such
as
I
had
never
felt
before
!
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
not
long
been
a
reader
of
the
``
Liberator
,
''
before
I
got
a
pretty
*NL*
correct
idea
of
the
principles
,
measures
and
spirit
of
the
anti-slavery
*NL*
reform
.
I
took
right
hold
of
the
cause
.
I
could
do
but
little
;
but
what
*NL*
I
could
,
I
did
with
a
joyful
heart
,
and
never
felt
happier
than
when
*NL*
in
an
anti-slavery
meeting
.
I
seldom
had
much
to
say
at
the
meetings
,
*NL*
because
what
I
wanted
to
say
was
said
so
much
better
by
others
.
But
,
*NL*
while
attending
an
anti-slavery
convention
at
Nantucket
,
on
the
11th
of
*NL*
August
,
1841
,
I
felt
strongly
moved
to
speak
,
and
was
at
the
same
time
*NL*
much
urged
to
do
so
by
Mr.
William
C.
Coffin
,
a
gentleman
who
had
heard
*NL*
me
speak
in
the
colored
people
's
meeting
at
New
Bedford
.
It
was
a
severe
*NL*
cross
,
and
I
took
it
up
reluctantly
.
The
truth
was
,
I
felt
myself
a
*NL*
slave
,
and
the
idea
of
speaking
to
white
people
weighed
me
down
.
I
spoke
*NL*
but
a
few
moments
,
when
I
felt
a
degree
of
freedom
,
and
said
what
I
*NL*
desired
with
considerable
ease
.
From
that
time
until
now
,
I
have
been
*NL*
engaged
in
pleading
the
cause
of
my
brethren
--
with
what
success
,
and
with
*NL*
what
devotion
,
I
leave
those
acquainted
with
my
labors

APPENDIX
*NL*
*NL*
I
find
,
since
reading
over
the
foregoing
Narrative
,
that
I
have
,
*NL*
in
several
instances
,
spoken
in
such
a
tone
and
manner
,
respecting
*NL*
religion
,
as
may
possibly
lead
those
unacquainted
with
my
religious
*NL*
views
to
suppose
me
an
opponent
of
all
religion
.
To
remove
the
liability
*NL*
of
such
misapprehension
,
I
deem
it
proper
to
append
the
following
brief
*NL*
explanation
.
What
I
have
said
respecting
and
against
religion
,
I
mean
*NL*
strictly
to
apply
to
the
_
slaveholding
religion
_
of
this
land
,
and
*NL*
with
no
possible
reference
to
Christianity
proper
;
for
,
between
the
*NL*
Christianity
of
this
land
,
and
the
Christianity
of
Christ
,
I
recognize
*NL*
the
widest
possible
difference
--
so
wide
,
that
to
receive
the
one
as
good
,
*NL*
pure
,
and
holy
,
is
of
necessity
to
reject
the
other
as
bad
,
corrupt
,
and
*NL*
wicked
.
To
be
the
friend
of
the
one
,
is
of
necessity
to
be
the
enemy
*NL*
of
the
other
.
I
love
the
pure
,
peaceable
,
and
impartial
Christianity
*NL*
of
Christ
:
I
therefore
hate
the
corrupt
,
slaveholding
,
women-whipping
,
*NL*
cradle-plundering
,
partial
and
hypocritical
Christianity
of
this
land
.
*NL*
Indeed
,
I
can
see
no
reason
,
but
the
most
deceitful
one
,
for
calling
the
*NL*
religion
of
this
land
Christianity
.
I
look
upon
it
as
the
climax
of
all
*NL*
misnomers
,
the
boldest
of
all
frauds
,
and
the
grossest
of
all
libels
.
*NL*
Never
was
there
a
clearer
case
of
``
stealing
the
livery
of
the
court
of
*NL*
heaven
to
serve
the
devil
in
.
''
I
am
filled
with
unutterable
loathing
*NL*
when
I
contemplate
the
religious
pomp
and
show
,
together
with
the
*NL*
horrible
inconsistencies
,
which
every
where
surround
me
.
We
have
*NL*
men-stealers
for
ministers
,
women-whippers
for
missionaries
,
*NL*
and
cradle-plunderers
for
church
members
.
The
man
who
wields
the
*NL*
blood-clotted
cowskin
during
the
week
fills
the
pulpit
on
Sunday
,
and
*NL*
claims
to
be
a
minister
of
the
meek
and
lowly
Jesus
.
The
man
who
robs
*NL*
me
of
my
earnings
at
the
end
of
each
week
meets
me
as
a
class-leader
on
*NL*
Sunday
morning
,
to
show
me
the
way
of
life
,
and
the
path
of
salvation
.
*NL*
He
who
sells
my
sister
,
for
purposes
of
prostitution
,
stands
forth
as
*NL*
the
pious
advocate
of
purity
.
He
who
proclaims
it
a
religious
duty
to
*NL*
read
the
Bible
denies
me
the
right
of
learning
to
read
the
name
of
the
*NL*
God
who
made
me
.
He
who
is
the
religious
advocate
of
marriage
robs
whole
*NL*
millions
of
its
sacred
influence
,
and
leaves
them
to
the
ravages
of
*NL*
wholesale
pollution
.
The
warm
defender
of
the
sacredness
of
the
family
*NL*
relation
is
the
same
that
scatters
whole
families
,
--
sundering
husbands
*NL*
and
wives
,
parents
and
children
,
sisters
and
brothers
,
--
leaving
the
hut
*NL*
vacant
,
and
the
hearth
desolate
.
We
see
the
thief
preaching
against
*NL*
theft
,
and
the
adulterer
against
adultery
.
We
have
men
sold
to
build
*NL*
churches
,
women
sold
to
support
the
gospel
,
and
babes
sold
to
purchase
*NL*
Bibles
for
the
_
Poor
Heathen
!
All
For
The
Glory
Of
God
And
The
Good
Of
*NL*
Souls
!
_
The
slave
auctioneer
's
bell
and
the
church-going
bell
chime
*NL*
in
with
each
other
,
and
the
bitter
cries
of
the
heart-broken
slave
*NL*
are
drowned
in
the
religious
shouts
of
his
pious
master
.
Revivals
of
*NL*
religion
and
revivals
in
the
slave-trade
go
hand
in
hand
together
.
*NL*
The
slave
prison
and
the
church
stand
near
each
other
.
The
clanking
of
*NL*
fetters
and
the
rattling
of
chains
in
the
prison
,
and
the
pious
psalm
*NL*
and
solemn
prayer
in
the
church
,
may
be
heard
at
the
same
time
.
The
*NL*
dealers
in
the
bodies
and
souls
of
men
erect
their
stand
in
the
presence
*NL*
of
the
pulpit
,
and
they
mutually
help
each
other
.
The
dealer
gives
his
*NL*
blood-stained
gold
to
support
the
pulpit
,
and
the
pulpit
,
in
return
,
*NL*
covers
his
infernal
business
with
the
garb
of
Christianity
.
Here
we
have
*NL*
religion
and
robbery
the
allies
of
each
other
--
devils
dressed
in
angels
'
*NL*
robes
,
and
hell
presenting
the
semblance
of
paradise
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Christianity
of
America
is
a
Christianity
,
of
whose
votaries
it
may
*NL*
be
as
truly
said
,
as
it
was
of
the
ancient
scribes
and
Pharisees
,
``
They
*NL*
bind
heavy
burdens
,
and
grievous
to

borne

and
lay
them
on

,
but
they
themselves
will
not
move
them
with
one
of
their
*NL*
fingers
.
All
their
works
they
do
for
to
be
seen
of
men

They
love
the
*NL*
uppermost

compass
sea

make

proselyte

and
when
he

ye

make
him
twofold
more

Woe

ye
pay

weightier

''
*NL*
*NL*
Dark
and
terrible
as
is
this
picture
,
I
hold
it
to
be
strictly
true
of
*NL*
the
overwhelming
mass
of
professed
Christians
in
America
.
They
strain
*NL*
at
a
gnat
,
and
swallow
a
camel
.
Could
any
thing
be
more
true
of
our
*NL*
churches
?
They
would
be
shocked
at
the
proposition
of
fellowshipping
*NL*
a
_
sheep
_
-
stealer
;
and
at
the
same
time
they
hug
to
their
communion
a
*NL*
_
man
_
-
stealer
,
and
brand
me
with
being
an
infidel
,
if
I
find
fault
with
*NL*
them
for
it
.
They
attend
with
Pharisaical
strictness
to
the
outward
*NL*
forms
of
religion
,
and
at
the
same
time
neglect
the
weightier
matters
of
*NL*
the
law
,
judgment
,
mercy
,
and
faith
.
They
are
always
ready
to
sacrifice
,
*NL*
but
seldom
to
show
mercy
.
They
are
they
who
are
represented
as
*NL*
professing
to
love
God
whom
they
have
not
seen
,
whilst
they
hate
their
*NL*
brother
whom
they
have
seen
.
They
love
the
heathen
on
the
other
side
of
*NL*
the
globe
.
They
can
pray
for
him
,
pay
money
to
have
the
Bible
put
into
*NL*
his
hand
,
and
missionaries
to
instruct
him
;
while
they
despise
and
*NL*
totally
neglect
the
heathen
at
their
own
doors
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
is
,
very
briefly
,
my
view
of
the
religion
of
this
land
;
and
to
*NL*
avoid
any
misunderstanding
,
growing
out
of
the
use
of
general
terms
,
I
*NL*
mean
by
the
religion
of
this
land
,
that
which
is
revealed
in
the
words
,
*NL*
deeds
,
and
actions
,
of
those
bodies
,
north
and
south
,
calling
themselves
*NL*
Christian
churches
,
and
yet
in
union
with
slaveholders
.
It
is
against
*NL*
religion
,
as
presented
by
these
bodies
,
that
I
have
felt
it
my
duty
to
*NL*
testify
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
conclude
these
remarks
by
copying
the
following
portrait
of
the
*NL*
religion
of
the
south
,
-LRB-
which
is
,
by
communion
and
fellowship
,
the
*NL*
religion
of
the
north
,
-RRB-
which
I
soberly
affirm
is
``
true
to
the
life
,
''
*NL*
and
without
caricature
or
the
slightest
exaggeration
.
It
is
said
to
*NL*
have
been
drawn
,
several
years
before
the
present
anti-slavery
agitation
*NL*
began
,
by
a
northern
Methodist
preacher
,
who
,
while
residing
at
the
*NL*
south
,
had
an
opportunity
to
see
slaveholding
morals
,
manners
,
and
*NL*
piety
,
with
his
own
eyes
.
``
Shall
I
not
visit
for
these
things
?
saith
the
*NL*
Lord
.
Shall
not
my
soul
be
avenged
on
such
a
nation
as
this
