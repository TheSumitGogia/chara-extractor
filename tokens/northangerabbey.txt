BY
THE
AUTHORESS
,
TO
NORTHANGER
ABBEY
*NL*
*NL*
THIS
little
work
was
finished
in
the
year
1803
,
and
intended
for
*NL*
immediate
publication
.
It
was
disposed
of
to
a
bookseller
,
it
was
even
*NL*
advertised
,
and
why
the
business
proceeded
no
farther
,
the
author
*NL*
has
never
been
able
to
learn
.
That
any
bookseller
should
think
it
*NL*
worth-while
to
purchase
what
he
did
not
think
it
worth-while
to
publish
*NL*
seems
extraordinary
.
But
with
this
,
neither
the
author
nor
the
public
*NL*
have
any
other
concern
than
as
some
observation
is
necessary
upon
those
*NL*
parts
of
the
work
which
thirteen
years
have
made
comparatively
obsolete
.
*NL*
The
public
are
entreated
to
bear
in
mind
that
thirteen
years
have
passed
*NL*
since
it
was
finished
,
many
more
since
it
was
begun
,
and
that
during
*NL*
that
period
,
places
,
manners
,
books
,
and
opinions
have
undergone
*NL*
considerable
changes
.

CHAPTER
1
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
No
one
who
had
ever
seen
Catherine
Morland
in
her
infancy
would
have
*NL*
supposed
her
born
to
be
an
heroine
.
Her
situation
in
life
,
the
character
*NL*
of
her
father
and
mother
,
her
own
person
and
disposition
,
were
*NL*
all
equally
against
her
.
Her
father
was
a
clergyman
,
without
being
*NL*
neglected
,
or
poor
,
and
a
very
respectable
man
,
though
his
name
*NL*
was
Richard
--
and
he
had
never
been
handsome
.
He
had
a
considerable
*NL*
independence
besides
two
good
livings
--
and
he
was
not
in
the
least
*NL*
addicted
to
locking
up
his
daughters
.
Her
mother
was
a
woman
of
useful
*NL*
plain
sense
,
with
a
good
temper
,
and
,
what
is
more
remarkable
,
with
a
*NL*
good
constitution
.
She
had
three
sons
before
Catherine
was
born
;
and
*NL*
instead
of
dying
in
bringing
the
latter
into
the
world
,
as
anybody
might
*NL*
expect
,
she
still
lived
on
--
lived
to
have
six
children
more
--
to
see
them
*NL*
growing
up
around
her
,
and
to
enjoy
excellent
health
herself
.
A
family
*NL*
of
ten
children
will
be
always
called
a
fine
family
,
where
there
are
*NL*
heads
and
arms
and
legs
enough
for
the
number
;
but
the
Morlands
had
*NL*
little
other
right
to
the
word
,
for
they
were
in
general
very
plain
,
and
*NL*
Catherine
,
for
many
years
of
her
life
,
as
plain
as
any
.
She
had
a
thin
*NL*
awkward
figure
,
a
sallow
skin
without
colour
,
dark
lank
hair
,
and
strong
*NL*
features
--
so
much
for
her
person
;
and
not
less
unpropitious
for
heroism
*NL*
seemed
her
mind
.
She
was
fond
of
all
boy
's
plays
,
and
greatly
preferred
*NL*
cricket
not
merely
to
dolls
,
but
to
the
more
heroic
enjoyments
of
*NL*
infancy
,
nursing
a
dormouse
,
feeding
a
canary-bird
,
or
watering
a
*NL*
rose-bush
.
Indeed
she
had
no
taste
for
a
garden
;
and
if
she
gathered
*NL*
flowers
at
all
,
it
was
chiefly
for
the
pleasure
of
mischief
--
at
least
*NL*
so
it
was
conjectured
from
her
always
preferring
those
which
she
was
*NL*
forbidden
to
take
.
Such
were
her
propensities
--
her
abilities
were
quite
*NL*
as
extraordinary
.
She
never
could
learn
or
understand
anything
*NL*
before
she
was
taught
;
and
sometimes
not
even
then
,
for
she
was
often
*NL*
inattentive
,
and
occasionally
stupid
.
Her
mother
was
three
months
in
*NL*
teaching
her
only
to
repeat
the
``
Beggar
's
Petition
''
;
and
after
all
,
her
*NL*
next
sister
,
Sally
,
could
say
it
better
than
she
did
.
Not
that
Catherine
*NL*
was
always
stupid
--
by
no
means
;
she
learnt
the
fable
of
``
The
Hare
and
*NL*
Many
Friends
''
as
quickly
as
any
girl
in
England
.
Her
mother
wished
her
*NL*
to
learn
music
;
and
Catherine
was
sure
she
should
like
it
,
for
she
was
*NL*
very
fond
of
tinkling
the
keys
of
the
old
forlorn
spinnet
;
so
,
at
eight
*NL*
years
old
she
began
.
She
learnt
a
year
,
and
could
not
bear
it
;
and
Mrs.
*NL*
Morland
,
who
did
not
insist
on
her
daughters
being
accomplished
in
*NL*
spite
of
incapacity
or
distaste
,
allowed
her
to
leave
off
.
The
day
which
*NL*
dismissed
the
music-master
was
one
of
the
happiest
of
Catherine
's
life
.
*NL*
Her
taste
for
drawing
was
not
superior
;
though
whenever
she
could
obtain
*NL*
the
outside
of
a
letter
from
her
mother
or
seize
upon
any
other
odd
*NL*
piece
of
paper
,
she
did
what
she
could
in
that
way
,
by
drawing
houses
*NL*
and
trees
,
hens
and
chickens
,
all
very
much
like
one
another
.
Writing
*NL*
and
accounts
she
was
taught
by
her
father
;
French
by
her
mother
:
her
*NL*
proficiency
in
either
was
not
remarkable
,
and
she
shirked
her
lessons
in
*NL*
both
whenever
she
could
.
What
a
strange
,
unaccountable
character
!
--
for
*NL*
with
all
these
symptoms
of
profligacy
at
ten
years
old
,
she
had
neither
*NL*
a
bad
heart
nor
a
bad
temper
,
was
seldom
stubborn
,
scarcely
ever
*NL*
quarrelsome
,
and
very
kind
to
the
little
ones
,
with
few
interruptions
*NL*
of
tyranny
;
she
was
moreover
noisy
and
wild
,
hated
confinement
and
*NL*
cleanliness
,
and
loved
nothing
so
well
in
the
world
as
rolling
down
the
*NL*
green
slope
at
the
back
of
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
was
Catherine
Morland
at
ten
.
At
fifteen
,
appearances
were
mending
;
*NL*
she
began
to
curl
her
hair
and
long
for
balls
;
her
complexion
improved
,
*NL*
her
features
were
softened
by
plumpness
and
colour
,
her
eyes
gained
more
*NL*
animation
,
and
her
figure
more
consequence
.
Her
love
of
dirt
gave
way
to
*NL*
an
inclination
for
finery
,
and
she
grew
clean
as
she
grew
smart
;
she
had
*NL*
now
the
pleasure
of
sometimes
hearing
her
father
and
mother
remark
*NL*
on
her
personal
improvement
.
``
Catherine
grows
quite
a
good-looking
*NL*
girl
--
she
is
almost
pretty
today
,
''
were
words
which
caught
her
ears
now
*NL*
and
then
;
and
how
welcome
were
the
sounds
!
To
look
almost
pretty
is
an
*NL*
acquisition
of
higher
delight
to
a
girl
who
has
been
looking
plain
the
*NL*
first
fifteen
years
of
her
life
than
a
beauty
from
her
cradle
can
ever
*NL*
receive
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Morland
was
a
very
good
woman
,
and
wished
to
see
her
children
*NL*
everything
they
ought
to
be
;
but
her
time
was
so
much
occupied
in
*NL*
lying-in
and
teaching
the
little
ones
,
that
her
elder
daughters
were
*NL*
inevitably
left
to
shift
for
themselves
;
and
it
was
not
very
wonderful
*NL*
that
Catherine
,
who
had
by
nature
nothing
heroic
about
her
,
should
*NL*
prefer
cricket
,
baseball
,
riding
on
horseback
,
and
running
about
*NL*
the
country
at
the
age
of
fourteen
,
to
books
--
or
at
least
books
of
*NL*
information
--
for
,
provided
that
nothing
like
useful
knowledge
could
be
*NL*
gained
from
them
,
provided
they
were
all
story
and
no
reflection
,
she
*NL*
had
never
any
objection
to
books
at
all
.
But
from
fifteen
to
seventeen
*NL*
she
was
in
training
for
a
heroine
;
she
read
all
such
works
as
heroines
*NL*
must
read
to
supply
their
memories
with
those
quotations
which
are
so
*NL*
serviceable
and
so
soothing
in
the
vicissitudes
of
their
eventful
lives
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
Pope
,
she
learnt
to
censure
those
who
*NL*
*NL*
``
bear
about
the
mockery
of
woe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
From
Gray
,
that
*NL*
*NL*
``
Many
a
flower
is
born
to
blush
unseen
,
*NL*
``
And
waste
its
fragrance
on
the
desert
air
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
From
Thompson
,
that
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
delightful
task
*NL*
``
To
teach
the
young
idea
how
to
shoot
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
And
from
Shakespeare
she
gained
a
great
store
of
information
--
amongst
*NL*
the
rest
,
that
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Trifles
light
as
air
,
*NL*
``
Are
,
to
the
jealous
,
confirmation
strong
,
*NL*
``
As
proofs
of
Holy
Writ
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
That
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
poor
beetle
,
which
we
tread
upon
,
*NL*
``
In
corporal
sufferance
feels
a
pang
as
great
*NL*
``
As
when
a
giant
dies
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
And
that
a
young
woman
in
love
always
looks
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
like
Patience
on
a
monument
*NL*
``
Smiling
at
Grief
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
So
far
her
improvement
was
sufficient
--
and
in
many
other
points
she
came
*NL*
on
exceedingly
well
;
for
though
she
could
not
write
sonnets
,
she
brought
*NL*
herself
to
read
them
;
and
though
there
seemed
no
chance
of
her
throwing
*NL*
a
whole
party
into
raptures
by
a
prelude
on
the
pianoforte
,
of
her
own
*NL*
composition
,
she
could
listen
to
other
people
's
performance
with
very
*NL*
little
fatigue
.
Her
greatest
deficiency
was
in
the
pencil
--
she
had
no
*NL*
notion
of
drawing
--
not
enough
even
to
attempt
a
sketch
of
her
lover
's
*NL*
profile
,
that
she
might
be
detected
in
the
design
.
There
she
fell
*NL*
miserably
short
of
the
true
heroic
height
.
At
present
she
did
not
know
*NL*
her
own
poverty
,
for
she
had
no
lover
to
portray
.
She
had
reached
the
*NL*
age
of
seventeen
,
without
having
seen
one
amiable
youth
who
could
call
*NL*
forth
her
sensibility
,
without
having
inspired
one
real
passion
,
and
*NL*
without
having
excited
even
any
admiration
but
what
was
very
moderate
*NL*
and
very
transient
.
This
was
strange
indeed
!
But
strange
things
may
be
*NL*
generally
accounted
for
if
their
cause
be
fairly
searched
out
.
There
was
*NL*
not
one
lord
in
the
neighbourhood
;
no
--
not
even
a
baronet
.
There
was
not
*NL*
one
family
among
their
acquaintance
who
had
reared
and
supported
a
boy
*NL*
accidentally
found
at
their
door
--
not
one
young
man
whose
origin
*NL*
was
unknown
.
Her
father
had
no
ward
,
and
the
squire
of
the
parish
no
*NL*
children
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
when
a
young
lady
is
to
be
a
heroine
,
the
perverseness
of
forty
*NL*
surrounding
families
can
not
prevent
her
.
Something
must
and
will
happen
*NL*
to
throw
a
hero
in
her
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Allen
,
who
owned
the
chief
of
the
property
about
Fullerton
,
the
*NL*
village
in
Wiltshire
where
the
Morlands
lived
,
was
ordered
to
Bath
*NL*
for
the
benefit
of
a
gouty
constitution
--
and
his
lady
,
a
good-humoured
*NL*
woman
,
fond
of
Miss
Morland
,
and
probably
aware
that
if
adventures
will
*NL*
not
befall
a
young
lady
in
her
own
village
,
she
must
seek
them
abroad
,
*NL*
invited
her
to
go
with
them
.
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Morland
were
all
compliance
,
*NL*
and
Catherine
all
happiness
.
*NL*
*NL*

CHAPTER
2
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
In
addition
to
what
has
been
already
said
of
Catherine
Morland
's
*NL*
personal
and
mental
endowments
,
when
about
to
be
launched
into
all
the
*NL*
difficulties
and
dangers
of
a
six
weeks
'
residence
in
Bath
,
it
may
be
*NL*
stated
,
for
the
reader
's
more
certain
information
,
lest
the
following
*NL*
pages
should
otherwise
fail
of
giving
any
idea
of
what
her
character
is
*NL*
meant
to
be
,
that
her
heart
was
affectionate
;
her
disposition
cheerful
*NL*
and
open
,
without
conceit
or
affectation
of
any
kind
--
her
manners
just
*NL*
removed
from
the
awkwardness
and
shyness
of
a
girl
;
her
person
pleasing
,
*NL*
and
,
when
in
good
looks
,
pretty
--
and
her
mind
about
as
ignorant
and
*NL*
uninformed
as
the
female
mind
at
seventeen
usually
is
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
hour
of
departure
drew
near
,
the
maternal
anxiety
of
Mrs.
*NL*
Morland
will
be
naturally
supposed
to
be
most
severe
.
A
thousand
*NL*
alarming
presentiments
of
evil
to
her
beloved
Catherine
from
this
*NL*
terrific
separation
must
oppress
her
heart
with
sadness
,
and
drown
her
*NL*
in
tears
for
the
last
day
or
two
of
their
being
together
;
and
advice
of
*NL*
the
most
important
and
applicable
nature
must
of
course
flow
from
her
*NL*
wise
lips
in
their
parting
conference
in
her
closet
.
Cautions
against
*NL*
the
violence
of
such
noblemen
and
baronets
as
delight
in
forcing
young
*NL*
ladies
away
to
some
remote
farm-house
,
must
,
at
such
a
moment
,
relieve
*NL*
the
fulness
of
her
heart
.
Who
would
not
think
so
?
But
Mrs.
Morland
knew
*NL*
so
little
of
lords
and
baronets
,
that
she
entertained
no
notion
of
their
*NL*
general
mischievousness
,
and
was
wholly
unsuspicious
of
danger
to
her
*NL*
daughter
from
their
machinations
.
Her
cautions
were
confined
to
the
*NL*
following
points
.
``
I
beg
,
Catherine
,
you
will
always
wrap
yourself
up
*NL*
very
warm
about
the
throat
,
when
you
come
from
the
rooms
at
night
;
and
*NL*
I
wish
you
would
try
to
keep
some
account
of
the
money
you
spend
;
I
will
*NL*
give
you
this
little
book
on
purpose
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sally
,
or
rather
Sarah
-LRB-
for
what
young
lady
of
common
gentility
will
*NL*
reach
the
age
of
sixteen
without
altering
her
name
as
far
as
she
can
?
-RRB-
,
*NL*
must
from
situation
be
at
this
time
the
intimate
friend
and
confidante
*NL*
of
her
sister
.
It
is
remarkable
,
however
,
that
she
neither
insisted
*NL*
on
Catherine
's
writing
by
every
post
,
nor
exacted
her
promise
of
*NL*
transmitting
the
character
of
every
new
acquaintance
,
nor
a
detail
*NL*
of
every
interesting
conversation
that
Bath
might
produce
.
Everything
*NL*
indeed
relative
to
this
important
journey
was
done
,
on
the
part
of
the
*NL*
Morlands
,
with
a
degree
of
moderation
and
composure
,
which
seemed
*NL*
rather
consistent
with
the
common
feelings
of
common
life
,
than
with
the
*NL*
refined
susceptibilities
,
the
tender
emotions
which
the
first
separation
*NL*
of
a
heroine
from
her
family
ought
always
to
excite
.
Her
father
,
instead
*NL*
of
giving
her
an
unlimited
order
on
his
banker
,
or
even
putting
an
*NL*
hundred
pounds
bank-bill
into
her
hands
,
gave
her
only
ten
guineas
,
and
*NL*
promised
her
more
when
she
wanted
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Under
these
unpromising
auspices
,
the
parting
took
place
,
and
the
*NL*
journey
began
.
It
was
performed
with
suitable
quietness
and
uneventful
*NL*
safety
.
Neither
robbers
nor
tempests
befriended
them
,
nor
one
lucky
*NL*
overturn
to
introduce
them
to
the
hero
.
Nothing
more
alarming
occurred
*NL*
than
a
fear
,
on
Mrs.
Allen
's
side
,
of
having
once
left
her
clogs
behind
*NL*
her
at
an
inn
,
and
that
fortunately
proved
to
be
groundless
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
arrived
at
Bath
.
Catherine
was
all
eager
delight
--
her
eyes
were
*NL*
here
,
there
,
everywhere
,
as
they
approached
its
fine
and
striking
*NL*
environs
,
and
afterwards
drove
through
those
streets
which
conducted
*NL*
them
to
the
hotel
.
She
was
come
to
be
happy
,
and
she
felt
happy
already
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
soon
settled
in
comfortable
lodgings
in
Pulteney
Street
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
now
expedient
to
give
some
description
of
Mrs.
Allen
,
that
the
*NL*
reader
may
be
able
to
judge
in
what
manner
her
actions
will
hereafter
*NL*
tend
to
promote
the
general
distress
of
the
work
,
and
how
she
will
,
*NL*
probably
,
contribute
to
reduce
poor
Catherine
to
all
the
desperate
*NL*
wretchedness
of
which
a
last
volume
is
capable
--
whether
by
her
*NL*
imprudence
,
vulgarity
,
or
jealousy
--
whether
by
intercepting
her
letters
,
*NL*
ruining
her
character
,
or
turning
her
out
of
doors
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Allen
was
one
of
that
numerous
class
of
females
,
whose
society
can
*NL*
raise
no
other
emotion
than
surprise
at
there
being
any
men
in
the
world
*NL*
who
could
like
them
well
enough
to
marry
them
.
She
had
neither
beauty
,
*NL*
genius
,
accomplishment
,
nor
manner
.
The
air
of
a
gentlewoman
,
a
great
*NL*
deal
of
quiet
,
inactive
good
temper
,
and
a
trifling
turn
of
mind
*NL*
were
all
that
could
account
for
her
being
the
choice
of
a
sensible
,
*NL*
intelligent
man
like
Mr.
Allen
.
In
one
respect
she
was
admirably
fitted
*NL*
to
introduce
a
young
lady
into
public
,
being
as
fond
of
going
everywhere
*NL*
and
seeing
everything
herself
as
any
young
lady
could
be
.
Dress
was
*NL*
her
passion
.
She
had
a
most
harmless
delight
in
being
fine
;
and
our
*NL*
heroine
's
entree
into
life
could
not
take
place
till
after
three
or
four
*NL*
days
had
been
spent
in
learning
what
was
mostly
worn
,
and
her
chaperone
*NL*
was
provided
with
a
dress
of
the
newest
fashion
.
Catherine
too
made
*NL*
some
purchases
herself
,
and
when
all
these
matters
were
arranged
,
the
*NL*
important
evening
came
which
was
to
usher
her
into
the
Upper
Rooms
.
Her
*NL*
hair
was
cut
and
dressed
by
the
best
hand
,
her
clothes
put
on
with
care
,
*NL*
and
both
Mrs.
Allen
and
her
maid
declared
she
looked
quite
as
she
should
*NL*
do
.
With
such
encouragement
,
Catherine
hoped
at
least
to
pass
uncensured
*NL*
through
the
crowd
.
As
for
admiration
,
it
was
always
very
welcome
when
it
*NL*
came
,
but
she
did
not
depend
on
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Allen
was
so
long
in
dressing
that
they
did
not
enter
the
ballroom
*NL*
till
late
.
The
season
was
full
,
the
room
crowded
,
and
the
two
ladies
*NL*
squeezed
in
as
well
as
they
could
.
As
for
Mr.
Allen
,
he
repaired
*NL*
directly
to
the
card-room
,
and
left
them
to
enjoy
a
mob
by
themselves
.
*NL*
With
more
care
for
the
safety
of
her
new
gown
than
for
the
comfort
of
*NL*
her
protegee
,
Mrs.
Allen
made
her
way
through
the
throng
of
men
by
*NL*
the
door
,
as
swiftly
as
the
necessary
caution
would
allow
;
Catherine
,
*NL*
however
,
kept
close
at
her
side
,
and
linked
her
arm
too
firmly
within
*NL*
her
friend
's
to
be
torn
asunder
by
any
common
effort
of
a
struggling
*NL*
assembly
.
But
to
her
utter
amazement
she
found
that
to
proceed
along
the
*NL*
room
was
by
no
means
the
way
to
disengage
themselves
from
the
crowd
;
it
*NL*
seemed
rather
to
increase
as
they
went
on
,
whereas
she
had
imagined
that
*NL*
when
once
fairly
within
the
door
,
they
should
easily
find
seats
and
be
*NL*
able
to
watch
the
dances
with
perfect
convenience
.
But
this
was
far
from
*NL*
being
the
case
,
and
though
by
unwearied
diligence
they
gained
even
the
*NL*
top
of
the
room
,
their
situation
was
just
the
same
;
they
saw
nothing
*NL*
of
the
dancers
but
the
high
feathers
of
some
of
the
ladies
.
Still
they
*NL*
moved
on
--
something
better
was
yet
in
view
;
and
by
a
continued
exertion
*NL*
of
strength
and
ingenuity
they
found
themselves
at
last
in
the
passage
*NL*
behind
the
highest
bench
.
Here
there
was
something
less
of
crowd
than
*NL*
below
;
and
hence
Miss
Morland
had
a
comprehensive
view
of
all
the
*NL*
company
beneath
her
,
and
of
all
the
dangers
of
her
late
passage
through
*NL*
them
.
It
was
a
splendid
sight
,
and
she
began
,
for
the
first
time
that
*NL*
evening
,
to
feel
herself
at
a
ball
:
she
longed
to
dance
,
but
she
had
*NL*
not
an
acquaintance
in
the
room
.
Mrs.
Allen
did
all
that
she
could
do
*NL*
in
such
a
case
by
saying
very
placidly
,
every
now
and
then
,
``
I
wish
you
*NL*
could
dance
,
my
dear
--
I
wish
you
could
get
a
partner
.
''
For
some
time
*NL*
her
young
friend
felt
obliged
to
her
for
these
wishes
;
but
they
were
*NL*
repeated
so
often
,
and
proved
so
totally
ineffectual
,
that
Catherine
*NL*
grew
tired
at
last
,
and
would
thank
her
no
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
not
long
able
,
however
,
to
enjoy
the
repose
of
the
eminence
*NL*
they
had
so
laboriously
gained
.
Everybody
was
shortly
in
motion
for
*NL*
tea
,
and
they
must
squeeze
out
like
the
rest
.
Catherine
began
to
feel
*NL*
something
of
disappointment
--
she
was
tired
of
being
continually
pressed
*NL*
against
by
people
,
the
generality
of
whose
faces
possessed
nothing
to
*NL*
interest
,
and
with
all
of
whom
she
was
so
wholly
unacquainted
that
she
*NL*
could
not
relieve
the
irksomeness
of
imprisonment
by
the
exchange
of
a
*NL*
syllable
with
any
of
her
fellow
captives
;
and
when
at
last
arrived
in
*NL*
the
tea-room
,
she
felt
yet
more
the
awkwardness
of
having
no
party
to
*NL*
join
,
no
acquaintance
to
claim
,
no
gentleman
to
assist
them
.
They
saw
*NL*
nothing
of
Mr.
Allen
;
and
after
looking
about
them
in
vain
for
a
more
*NL*
eligible
situation
,
were
obliged
to
sit
down
at
the
end
of
a
table
,
at
*NL*
which
a
large
party
were
already
placed
,
without
having
anything
to
do
*NL*
there
,
or
anybody
to
speak
to
,
except
each
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Allen
congratulated
herself
,
as
soon
as
they
were
seated
,
on
having
*NL*
preserved
her
gown
from
injury
.
``
It
would
have
been
very
shocking
to
*NL*
have
it
torn
,
''
said
she
,
``
would
not
it
?
It
is
such
a
delicate
muslin
.
*NL*
For
my
part
I
have
not
seen
anything
I
like
so
well
in
the
whole
room
,
I
*NL*
assure
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
uncomfortable
it
is
,
''
whispered
Catherine
,
``
not
to
have
a
single
*NL*
acquaintance
here
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
my
dear
,
''
replied
Mrs.
Allen
,
with
perfect
serenity
,
``
it
is
very
*NL*
uncomfortable
indeed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
shall
we
do
?
The
gentlemen
and
ladies
at
this
table
look
as
if
*NL*
they
wondered
why
we
came
here
--
we
seem
forcing
ourselves
into
their
*NL*
party
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
,
so
we
do
.
That
is
very
disagreeable
.
I
wish
we
had
a
large
*NL*
acquaintance
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
we
had
any
--
it
would
be
somebody
to
go
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
true
,
my
dear
;
and
if
we
knew
anybody
we
would
join
them
directly
.
*NL*
The
Skinners
were
here
last
year
--
I
wish
they
were
here
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Had
not
we
better
go
away
as
it
is
?
Here
are
no
tea-things
for
us
,
you
*NL*
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
more
there
are
,
indeed
.
How
very
provoking
!
But
I
think
we
had
*NL*
better
sit
still
,
for
one
gets
so
tumbled
in
such
a
crowd
!
How
is
my
*NL*
head
,
my
dear
?
Somebody
gave
me
a
push
that
has
hurt
it
,
I
am
afraid
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
indeed
,
it
looks
very
nice
.
But
,
dear
Mrs.
Allen
,
are
you
sure
*NL*
there
is
nobody
you
know
in
all
this
multitude
of
people
?
I
think
you
*NL*
must
know
somebody
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
,
upon
my
word
--
I
wish
I
did
.
I
wish
I
had
a
large
acquaintance
*NL*
here
with
all
my
heart
,
and
then
I
should
get
you
a
partner
.
I
should
be
*NL*
so
glad
to
have
you
dance
.
There
goes
a
strange-looking
woman
!
What
an
*NL*
odd
gown
she
has
got
on
!
How
old-fashioned
it
is
!
Look
at
the
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
some
time
they
received
an
offer
of
tea
from
one
of
their
*NL*
neighbours
;
it
was
thankfully
accepted
,
and
this
introduced
a
light
*NL*
conversation
with
the
gentleman
who
offered
it
,
which
was
the
only
time
*NL*
that
anybody
spoke
to
them
during
the
evening
,
till
they
were
discovered
*NL*
and
joined
by
Mr.
Allen
when
the
dance
was
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Miss
Morland
,
''
said
he
,
directly
,
``
I
hope
you
have
had
an
*NL*
agreeable
ball
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
agreeable
indeed
,
''
she
replied
,
vainly
endeavouring
to
hide
a
*NL*
great
yawn
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
she
had
been
able
to
dance
,
''
said
his
wife
;
``
I
wish
we
could
*NL*
have
got
a
partner
for
her
.
I
have
been
saying
how
glad
I
should
be
if
*NL*
the
Skinners
were
here
this
winter
instead
of
last
;
or
if
the
Parrys
had
*NL*
come
,
as
they
talked
of
once
,
she
might
have
danced
with
George
Parry
.
I
*NL*
am
so
sorry
she
has
not
had
a
partner
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
shall
do
better
another
evening
I
hope
,
''
was
Mr.
Allen
's
*NL*
consolation
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
company
began
to
disperse
when
the
dancing
was
over
--
enough
to
leave
*NL*
space
for
the
remainder
to
walk
about
in
some
comfort
;
and
now
was
the
*NL*
time
for
a
heroine
,
who
had
not
yet
played
a
very
distinguished
part
*NL*
in
the
events
of
the
evening
,
to
be
noticed
and
admired
.
Every
five
*NL*
minutes
,
by
removing
some
of
the
crowd
,
gave
greater
openings
for
her
*NL*
charms
.
She
was
now
seen
by
many
young
men
who
had
not
been
near
her
*NL*
before
.
Not
one
,
however
,
started
with
rapturous
wonder
on
beholding
*NL*
her
,
no
whisper
of
eager
inquiry
ran
round
the
room
,
nor
was
she
once
*NL*
called
a
divinity
by
anybody
.
Yet
Catherine
was
in
very
good
looks
,
and
*NL*
had
the
company
only
seen
her
three
years
before
,
they
would
now
have
*NL*
thought
her
exceedingly
handsome
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
looked
at
,
however
,
and
with
some
admiration
;
for
,
in
her
own
*NL*
hearing
,
two
gentlemen
pronounced
her
to
be
a
pretty
girl
.
Such
words
*NL*
had
their
due
effect
;
she
immediately
thought
the
evening
pleasanter
*NL*
than
she
had
found
it
before
--
her
humble
vanity
was
contented
--
she
*NL*
felt
more
obliged
to
the
two
young
men
for
this
simple
praise
than
a
*NL*
true-quality
heroine
would
have
been
for
fifteen
sonnets
in
celebration
*NL*
of
her
charms
,
and
went
to
her
chair
in
good
humour
with
everybody
,
and
*NL*
perfectly
satisfied
with
her
share
of
public
attention
.

CHAPTER
3
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Every
morning
now
brought
its
regular
duties
--
shops
were
to
be
visited
;
*NL*
some
new
part
of
the
town
to
be
looked
at
;
and
the
pump-room
to
be
*NL*
attended
,
where
they
paraded
up
and
down
for
an
hour
,
looking
at
*NL*
everybody
and
speaking
to
no
one
.
The
wish
of
a
numerous
acquaintance
*NL*
in
Bath
was
still
uppermost
with
Mrs.
Allen
,
and
she
repeated
it
after
*NL*
every
fresh
proof
,
which
every
morning
brought
,
of
her
knowing
nobody
at
*NL*
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
made
their
appearance
in
the
Lower
Rooms
;
and
here
fortune
was
more
*NL*
favourable
to
our
heroine
.
The
master
of
the
ceremonies
introduced
to
*NL*
her
a
very
gentlemanlike
young
man
as
a
partner
;
his
name
was
Tilney
.
*NL*
He
seemed
to
be
about
four
or
five
and
twenty
,
was
rather
tall
,
had
a
*NL*
pleasing
countenance
,
a
very
intelligent
and
lively
eye
,
and
,
if
not
*NL*
quite
handsome
,
was
very
near
it
.
His
address
was
good
,
and
Catherine
*NL*
felt
herself
in
high
luck
.
There
was
little
leisure
for
speaking
*NL*
while
they
danced
;
but
when
they
were
seated
at
tea
,
she
found
him
as
*NL*
agreeable
as
she
had
already
given
him
credit
for
being
.
He
talked
with
*NL*
fluency
and
spirit
--
and
there
was
an
archness
and
pleasantry
in
his
*NL*
manner
which
interested
,
though
it
was
hardly
understood
by
her
.
After
*NL*
chatting
some
time
on
such
matters
as
naturally
arose
from
the
objects
*NL*
around
them
,
he
suddenly
addressed
her
with
--
``
I
have
hitherto
been
very
*NL*
remiss
,
madam
,
in
the
proper
attentions
of
a
partner
here
;
I
have
not
*NL*
yet
asked
you
how
long
you
have
been
in
Bath
;
whether
you
were
ever
here
*NL*
before
;
whether
you
have
been
at
the
Upper
Rooms
,
the
theatre
,
and
*NL*
the
concert
;
and
how
you
like
the
place
altogether
.
I
have
been
*NL*
very
negligent
--
but
are
you
now
at
leisure
to
satisfy
me
in
these
*NL*
particulars
?
If
you
are
I
will
begin
directly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
need
not
give
yourself
that
trouble
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
trouble
,
I
assure
you
,
madam
.
''
Then
forming
his
features
into
a
set
*NL*
smile
,
and
affectedly
softening
his
voice
,
he
added
,
with
a
simpering
*NL*
air
,
``
Have
you
been
long
in
Bath
,
madam
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
About
a
week
,
sir
,
''
replied
Catherine
,
trying
not
to
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
!
''
with
affected
astonishment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
should
you
be
surprised
,
sir
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
indeed
!
''
said
he
,
in
his
natural
tone
.
``
But
some
emotion
must
*NL*
appear
to
be
raised
by
your
reply
,
and
surprise
is
more
easily
assumed
,
*NL*
and
not
less
reasonable
than
any
other
.
Now
let
us
go
on
.
Were
you
never
*NL*
here
before
,
madam
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
!
Have
you
yet
honoured
the
Upper
Rooms
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
,
I
was
there
last
Monday
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
been
to
the
theatre
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
,
I
was
at
the
play
on
Tuesday
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
the
concert
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
,
on
Wednesday
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
are
you
altogether
pleased
with
Bath
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
I
like
it
very
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
I
must
give
one
smirk
,
and
then
we
may
be
rational
again
.
''
*NL*
Catherine
turned
away
her
head
,
not
knowing
whether
she
might
venture
to
*NL*
laugh
.
``
I
see
what
you
think
of
me
,
''
said
he
gravely
--
``
I
shall
make
but
*NL*
a
poor
figure
in
your
journal
tomorrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
journal
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
know
exactly
what
you
will
say
:
Friday
,
went
to
the
Lower
*NL*
Rooms
;
wore
my
sprigged
muslin
robe
with
blue
trimmings
--
plain
black
*NL*
shoes
--
appeared
to
much
advantage
;
but
was
strangely
harassed
by
a
*NL*
queer
,
half-witted
man
,
who
would
make
me
dance
with
him
,
and
distressed
*NL*
me
by
his
nonsense
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
I
shall
say
no
such
thing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
I
tell
you
what
you
ought
to
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
please
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
danced
with
a
very
agreeable
young
man
,
introduced
by
Mr.
King
;
had
*NL*
a
great
deal
of
conversation
with
him
--
seems
a
most
extraordinary
*NL*
genius
--
hope
I
may
know
more
of
him
.
That
,
madam
,
is
what
I
wish
you
to
*NL*
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
perhaps
,
I
keep
no
journal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
you
are
not
sitting
in
this
room
,
and
I
am
not
sitting
by
*NL*
you
.
These
are
points
in
which
a
doubt
is
equally
possible
.
Not
keep
a
*NL*
journal
!
How
are
your
absent
cousins
to
understand
the
tenour
of
your
*NL*
life
in
Bath
without
one
?
How
are
the
civilities
and
compliments
of
*NL*
every
day
to
be
related
as
they
ought
to
be
,
unless
noted
down
every
*NL*
evening
in
a
journal
?
How
are
your
various
dresses
to
be
remembered
,
*NL*
and
the
particular
state
of
your
complexion
,
and
curl
of
your
hair
to
be
*NL*
described
in
all
their
diversities
,
without
having
constant
recourse
to
*NL*
a
journal
?
My
dear
madam
,
I
am
not
so
ignorant
of
young
ladies
'
ways
as
*NL*
you
wish
to
believe
me
;
it
is
this
delightful
habit
of
journaling
which
*NL*
largely
contributes
to
form
the
easy
style
of
writing
for
which
ladies
*NL*
are
so
generally
celebrated
.
Everybody
allows
that
the
talent
of
writing
*NL*
agreeable
letters
is
peculiarly
female
.
Nature
may
have
done
something
,
*NL*
but
I
am
sure
it
must
be
essentially
assisted
by
the
practice
of
keeping
*NL*
a
journal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
sometimes
thought
,
''
said
Catherine
,
doubtingly
,
``
whether
ladies
*NL*
do
write
so
much
better
letters
than
gentlemen
!
That
is
--
I
should
not
*NL*
think
the
superiority
was
always
on
our
side
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
far
as
I
have
had
opportunity
of
judging
,
it
appears
to
me
that
the
*NL*
usual
style
of
letter-writing
among
women
is
faultless
,
except
in
three
*NL*
particulars
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
are
they
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
general
deficiency
of
subject
,
a
total
inattention
to
stops
,
and
a
*NL*
very
frequent
ignorance
of
grammar
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Upon
my
word
!
I
need
not
have
been
afraid
of
disclaiming
the
*NL*
compliment
.
You
do
not
think
too
highly
of
us
in
that
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
no
more
lay
it
down
as
a
general
rule
that
women
write
better
*NL*
letters
than
men
,
than
that
they
sing
better
duets
,
or
draw
better
*NL*
landscapes
.
In
every
power
,
of
which
taste
is
the
foundation
,
excellence
*NL*
is
pretty
fairly
divided
between
the
sexes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
interrupted
by
Mrs.
Allen
:
``
My
dear
Catherine
,
''
said
she
,
``
do
*NL*
take
this
pin
out
of
my
sleeve
;
I
am
afraid
it
has
torn
a
hole
already
;
*NL*
I
shall
be
quite
sorry
if
it
has
,
for
this
is
a
favourite
gown
,
though
*NL*
it
cost
but
nine
shillings
a
yard
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
exactly
what
I
should
have
guessed
it
,
madam

''
said
Mr.
Tilney
,
*NL*
looking
at
the
muslin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
understand
muslins
,
sir

*NL*
*NL*
``
Particularly
well
;
I
always
buy
my
own
cravats
,
and
am
allowed
to
be
an
*NL*
excellent
judge
;
and
my
sister
has
often
trusted
me
in
the
choice
of
a
*NL*
gown
.
I
bought
one
for
her
the
other
day
,
and
it
was
pronounced
to
be
a
*NL*
prodigious
bargain
by
every
lady
who
saw
it
.
I
gave
but
five
shillings
a
*NL*
yard
for
it
,
and
a
true
Indian
muslin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Allen
was
quite
struck
by
his
genius
.
``
Men
commonly
take
so
little
*NL*
notice
of
those
things
,
''
said
she
;
``
I
can
never
get
Mr.
Allen
to
know
*NL*
one
of
my
gowns
from
another

You
must
be
a
great
comfort
to
your
*NL*
sister

sir

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
I
am

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
pray
,
sir

what
do
you
think
of
Miss
Morland
's
gown
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
very
pretty
,
madam
,
''
said
he
,
gravely
examining
it
;
``
but
I
do
not
*NL*
think
it
will
wash
well
;
I
am
afraid
it
will
fray
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
you
,
''
said
Catherine
,
laughing
,
``
be
so
--
''
She
had
almost
said
*NL*
``
strange
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
quite
of
your
opinion
,
sir
,
''
replied
Mrs.
Allen
;
``
and
so
I
told
*NL*
Miss
Morland
when
she
bought
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
then
you
know
,
madam
,
muslin
always
turns
to
some
account

other
;
*NL*
Miss
Morland
will
get
enough
out
of
it
for
a
handkerchief
,
or
a
cap
,
or
*NL*
a
cloak
.
Muslin
can
never
be
said
to
be
wasted
.
I
have
heard
my
sister
*NL*
say
so
forty
times
,
when
she
has
been
extravagant
in
buying
more
than
*NL*
she
wanted

careless
in
cutting
it
to
pieces

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bath
is
a
charming
place
,
sir

there
are
so
many
good
shops
here

We

are
sadly
off
in
the
country
;
not
but
what
we
have
very
good
shops
in
*NL*
Salisbury
,
but
it
is
so
far
to
go

eight
miles
is
a
long
way

Mr.

says
it
is
nine

measured
nine

I
am
sure
it
can
not
be
more
than
*NL*
eight

and
it
is
such
a
fag

I
come
back
tired
to
death

Now

here
one
*NL*
can
step
out
of
doors

get
a
thing
in
five
minutes

*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Tilney
was
polite
enough
to
seem
interested
in
what
she
said
;
and
*NL*
she
kept
him
on
the
subject
of
muslins
till
the
dancing
recommenced
.
*NL*
Catherine
feared
,
as
she
listened
to
their
discourse
,
that
he
indulged
*NL*
himself
a
little
too
much
with
the
foibles
of
others
.
``
What
are
you
*NL*
thinking
of
so
earnestly
?
''
said
he
,
as
they
walked
back
to
the
ballroom
;
*NL*
``
not
of
your
partner
,
I
hope
,
for
,
by
that
shake
of
the
head
,
your
*NL*
meditations
are
not
satisfactory
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Catherine
coloured
,
and
said
,
``
I
was
not
thinking
of
anything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
artful
and
deep
,
to
be
sure

I
had
rather
be
told
at
once
*NL*
that
you
will
not
tell
me

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
then

I
will
not

*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you

for
now

shall
soon
be
acquainted

I
am
authorized

tease
you
on

subject
whenever
we
meet

nothing
in

world

intimacy
so
much

*NL*
*NL*
They
danced
again
;
and
,
when
the
assembly
closed
,
parted
,
on
the
*NL*
lady
's
side
at
least
,
with
a
strong
inclination
for
continuing
the
*NL*
acquaintance
.
Whether
she
thought
of
him
so
much
,
while
she
drank
her
*NL*
warm
wine
and
water
,
and
prepared
herself
for
bed
,
as
to
dream
of
him
*NL*
when
there
,
can
not
be
ascertained
;
but
I
hope
it
was
no
more
than
in
*NL*
a
slight
slumber
,
or
a
morning
doze
at
most
;
for
if
it
be
true
,
as
a
*NL*
celebrated
writer
has
maintained
,
that
no
young
lady
can
be
justified
*NL*
in
falling
in
love
before
the
gentleman
's
love
is
declared
,
*
it
must
be
*NL*
very
improper
that
a
young
lady
should
dream
of
a
gentleman
before
the
*NL*
gentleman
is
first
known
to
have
dreamt
of
her
.
How
proper
Mr.
Tilney
*NL*
might
be
as
a
dreamer
or
a
lover
had
not
yet
perhaps
entered
Mr.
Allen
's
*NL*
head
,
but
that
he
was
not
objectionable
as
a
common
acquaintance
for
*NL*
his
young
charge
he
was
on
inquiry
satisfied
;
for
he
had
early
in
the
*NL*
evening
taken
pains
to
know
who
her
partner
was
,
and
had
been
assured
*NL*
of
Mr.
Tilney
's
being
a
clergyman
,
and
of
a
very
respectable
family
in
*NL*
Gloucestershire

CHAPTER
4
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
With
more
than
usual
eagerness
did
Catherine
hasten
to
the
pump-room
the
*NL*
next
day
,
secure
within
herself
of
seeing
Mr.
Tilney
there
before
the
*NL*
morning
were
over
,
and
ready
to
meet
him
with
a
smile
;
but
no
smile
*NL*
was
demanded
--
Mr.
Tilney
did
not
appear
.
Every
creature
in
Bath
,
*NL*
except
himself
,
was
to
be
seen
in
the
room
at
different
periods
of
the
*NL*
fashionable
hours
;
crowds
of
people
were
every
moment
passing
in
and
*NL*
out
,
up
the
steps
and
down
;
people
whom
nobody
cared
about
,
and
nobody
*NL*
wanted
to
see
;
and
he
only
was
absent
.
``
What
a
delightful
place
Bath
*NL*
is
,
''
said
Mrs.
Allen
as
they
sat
down
near
the
great
clock
,
after
*NL*
parading
the
room
till
they
were
tired
;
``
and
how
pleasant
it
would
be
if
*NL*
we
had
any
acquaintance
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
sentiment
had
been
uttered
so
often
in
vain
that
Mrs.
Allen
had
no
*NL*
particular
reason
to
hope
it
would
be
followed
with
more
advantage
now
;
*NL*
but
we
are
told
to
``
despair
of
nothing
we
would
attain
,
''
as
``
unwearied
*NL*
diligence
our
point
would
gain
''
;
and
the
unwearied
diligence
with
which
*NL*
she
had
every
day
wished
for
the
same
thing
was
at
length
to
have
its
*NL*
just
reward
,
for
hardly
had
she
been
seated
ten
minutes
before
a
lady
of
*NL*
about
her
own
age
,
who
was
sitting
by
her
,
and
had
been
looking
at
her
*NL*
attentively
for
several
minutes
,
addressed
her
with
great
complaisance
*NL*
in
these
words
:
``
I
think
,
madam
,
I
can
not
be
mistaken
;
it
is
a
long
time
*NL*
since
I
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
,
but
is
not
your
name
Allen
?
''
*NL*
This
question
answered
,
as
it
readily
was
,
the
stranger
pronounced
hers
*NL*
to
be
Thorpe
;
and
Mrs.
Allen
immediately
recognized
the
features
of
*NL*
a
former
schoolfellow
and
intimate
,
whom
she
had
seen
only
once
since
*NL*
their
respective
marriages
,
and
that
many
years
ago
.
Their
joy
on
this
*NL*
meeting
was
very
great
,
as
well
it
might
,
since
they
had
been
contented
*NL*
to
know
nothing
of
each
other
for
the
last
fifteen
years
.
Compliments
*NL*
on
good
looks
now
passed
;
and
,
after
observing
how
time
had
slipped
away
*NL*
since
they
were
last
together
,
how
little
they
had
thought
of
meeting
in
*NL*
Bath
,
and
what
a
pleasure
it
was
to
see
an
old
friend
,
they
proceeded
to
*NL*
make
inquiries
and
give
intelligence
as
to
their
families
,
sisters
,
and
*NL*
cousins
,
talking
both
together
,
far
more
ready
to
give
than
to
receive
*NL*
information
,
and
each
hearing
very
little
of
what
the
other
said
.
Mrs.
*NL*
Thorpe
,
however
,
had
one
great
advantage
as
a
talker
,
over
Mrs.
Allen
,
*NL*
in
a
family
of
children
;
and
when
she
expatiated
on
the
talents
of
her
*NL*
sons
,
and
the
beauty
of
her
daughters
,
when
she
related
their
different
*NL*
situations
and

that
John
was
at
Oxford
,
Edward
at
Merchant
*NL*
Taylors
'
,
and
William
at
sea
--
and
all
of
them
more
beloved
and
respected
*NL*
in
their
different
station
than
any
other
three
beings
ever
were
,
Mrs.
*NL*
Allen
had
no
similar
information
to
give
,
no
similar
triumphs
to
press
*NL*
on
the
unwilling
and
unbelieving
ear
of
her
friend
,
and
was
forced
to
*NL*
sit
and
appear
to
listen
to
all
these
maternal
effusions
,
consoling
*NL*
herself
,
however
,
with
the
discovery
,
which
her
keen
eye
soon
made
,
that
*NL*
the
lace
on
Mrs.
Thorpe
's
pelisse
was
not
half
so
handsome
as
that
on
*NL*
her
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
come
my
dear
girls
,
''
cried
Mrs.
Thorpe
,
pointing
at
three
*NL*
smart-looking
females
who
,
arm
in
arm
,
were
then
moving
towards
her
.
``
My
*NL*
dear
Mrs.
Allen
,
I
long
to
introduce
them
;
they
will
be
so
delighted
*NL*
to
see
you
:
the
tallest
is
Isabella
,
my
eldest
;
is
not
she
a
fine
young
*NL*
woman
?
The
others
are
very
much
admired
too
,
but
I
believe
Isabella
is
*NL*
the
handsomest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Miss
Thorpes
were
introduced
;
and
Miss
Morland
,
who
had
been
for
a
*NL*
short
time
forgotten
,
was
introduced
likewise
.
The
name
seemed
to
strike
*NL*
them
all
;
and
,
after
speaking
to
her
with
great
civility
,
the
eldest
*NL*
young
lady
observed
aloud
to
the
rest
,
``
How
excessively
like
her
brother
*NL*
Miss
Morland
is
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
very
picture
of
him
indeed
!
''
cried
the
mother
--
and
``
I
should
have
*NL*
known
her
anywhere
for
his
sister
!
''
was
repeated
by
them
all
,
two
or
*NL*
three
times
over
.
For
a
moment
Catherine
was
surprised
;
but
Mrs.
Thorpe
*NL*
and
her
daughters
had
scarcely
begun
the
history
of
their
acquaintance
*NL*
with
Mr.
James
Morland
,
before
she
remembered
that
her
eldest
brother
*NL*
had
lately
formed
an
intimacy
with
a
young
man
of
his
own
college
,
of
*NL*
the
name
of
Thorpe
;
and
that
he
had
spent
the
last
week
of
the
Christmas
*NL*
vacation
with
his
family
,
near
London
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
whole
being
explained
,
many
obliging
things
were
said
by
the
Miss
*NL*
Thorpes
of
their
wish
of
being
better
acquainted
with
her
;
of
being
*NL*
considered
as
already
friends
,
through
the
friendship
of
their
brothers
,
*NL*
etc.
,
which
Catherine
heard
with
pleasure
,
and
answered
with
all
the
*NL*
pretty
expressions
she
could
command
;
and
,
as
the
first
proof
of
amity
,
*NL*
she
was
soon
invited
to
accept
an
arm
of
the
eldest
Miss
Thorpe
,
and
*NL*
take
a
turn
with
her
about
the
room
.
Catherine
was
delighted
with
this
*NL*
extension
of
her
Bath
acquaintance
,
and
almost
forgot
Mr.
Tilney
while
*NL*
she
talked
to
Miss
Thorpe
.
Friendship
is
certainly
the
finest
balm
for
*NL*
the
pangs
of
disappointed
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
Their
conversation
turned
upon
those
subjects
,
of
which
the
free
*NL*
discussion
has
generally
much
to
do
in
perfecting
a
sudden
intimacy
*NL*
between
two
young
ladies
:
such
as
dress
,
balls
,
flirtations
,
and
*NL*
quizzes
.
Miss
Thorpe
,
however
,
being
four
years
older
than
Miss
Morland
,
*NL*
and
at
least
four
years
better
informed
,
had
a
very
decided
advantage
in
*NL*
discussing
such
points
;
she
could
compare
the
balls
of
Bath
with
those
*NL*
of
Tunbridge
,
its
fashions
with
the
fashions
of
London
;
could
rectify
*NL*
the
opinions
of
her
new
friend
in
many
articles
of
tasteful
attire
;
*NL*
could
discover
a
flirtation
between
any
gentleman
and
lady
who
only
*NL*
smiled
on
each
other
;
and
point
out
a
quiz
through
the
thickness
of
a
*NL*
crowd
.
These
powers
received
due
admiration
from
Catherine
,
to
whom
they
*NL*
were
entirely
new
;
and
the
respect
which
they
naturally
inspired
might
*NL*
have
been
too
great
for
familiarity
,
had
not
the
easy
gaiety
of
Miss
*NL*
Thorpe
's
manners
,
and
her
frequent
expressions
of
delight
on
this
*NL*
acquaintance
with
her
,
softened
down
every
feeling
of
awe
,
and
left
*NL*
nothing
but
tender
affection
.
Their
increasing
attachment
was
not
to
be
*NL*
satisfied
with
half
a
dozen
turns
in
the
pump-room
,
but
required
,
when
*NL*
they
all
quitted
it
together
,
that
Miss
Thorpe
should
accompany
Miss
*NL*
Morland
to
the
very
door
of
Mr.
Allen
's
house
;
and
that
they
should
*NL*
there
part
with
a
most
affectionate
and
lengthened
shake
of
hands
,
after
*NL*
learning
,
to
their
mutual
relief
,
that
they
should
see
each
other
across
*NL*
the
theatre
at
night
,
and
say
their
prayers
in
the
same
chapel
the
next
*NL*
morning
.
Catherine
then
ran
directly
upstairs
,
and
watched
Miss
Thorpe
's
*NL*
progress
down
the
street
from
the
drawing-room
window
;
admired
the
*NL*
graceful
spirit
of
her
walk
,
the
fashionable
air
of
her
figure
and
*NL*
dress
;
and
felt
grateful
,
as
well
she
might
,
for
the
chance
which
had
*NL*
procured
her
such
a
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Thorpe
was
a
widow
,
and
not
a
very
rich
one
;
she
was
a
*NL*
good-humoured
,
well-meaning
woman
,
and
a
very
indulgent
mother
.
Her
*NL*
eldest
daughter
had
great
personal
beauty
,
and
the
younger
ones
,
by
*NL*
pretending
to
be
as
handsome
as
their
sister
,
imitating
her
air
,
and
*NL*
dressing
in
the
same
style
,
did
very
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
brief
account
of
the
family
is
intended
to
supersede
the
necessity
*NL*
of
a
long
and
minute
detail
from
Mrs.
Thorpe
herself
,
of
her
past
*NL*
adventures
and
sufferings
,
which
might
otherwise
be
expected
to
occupy
*NL*
the
three
or
four
following
chapters
;
in
which
the
worthlessness
of
*NL*
lords
and
attorneys
might
be
set
forth
,
and
conversations
,
which
had
*NL*
passed
twenty
years
before
,
be
minutely
repeated
.

CHAPTER
5
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Catherine
was
not
so
much
engaged
at
the
theatre
that
evening
,
in
*NL*
returning
the
nods
and
smiles
of
Miss
Thorpe
,
though
they
certainly
*NL*
claimed
much
of
her
leisure
,
as
to
forget
to
look
with
an
inquiring
eye
*NL*
for
Mr.
Tilney
in
every
box
which
her
eye
could
reach
;
but
she
looked
in
*NL*
vain
.
Mr.
Tilney
was
no
fonder
of
the
play
than
the
pump-room
.
She
hoped
*NL*
to
be
more
fortunate
the
next
day
;
and
when
her
wishes
for
fine
weather
*NL*
were
answered
by
seeing
a
beautiful
morning
,
she
hardly
felt
a
doubt
of
*NL*
it
;
for
a
fine
Sunday
in
Bath
empties
every
house
of
its
inhabitants
,
*NL*
and
all
the
world
appears
on
such
an
occasion
to
walk
about
and
tell
*NL*
their
acquaintance
what
a
charming
day
it
is
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
divine
service
was
over
,
the
Thorpes
and
Allens
eagerly
*NL*
joined
each
other
;
and
after
staying
long
enough
in
the
pump-room
to
*NL*
discover
that
the
crowd
was
insupportable
,
and
that
there
was
not
*NL*
a
genteel
face
to
be
seen
,
which
everybody
discovers
every
Sunday
*NL*
throughout
the
season
,
they
hastened
away
to
the
Crescent
,
to
breathe
*NL*
the
fresh
air
of
better
company
.
Here
Catherine
and
Isabella
,
arm
*NL*
in
arm
,
again
tasted
the
sweets
of
friendship
in
an
unreserved
*NL*
conversation
;
they
talked
much
,
and
with
much
enjoyment
;
but
again
*NL*
was
Catherine
disappointed
in
her
hope
of
reseeing
her
partner
.
He
was
*NL*
nowhere
to
be
met
with
;
every
search
for
him
was
equally
unsuccessful
,
*NL*
in
morning
lounges
or
evening
assemblies
;
neither
at
the
Upper
nor
Lower
*NL*
Rooms
,
at
dressed
or
undressed
balls
,
was
he
perceivable
;
nor
among
the
*NL*
walkers
,
the
horsemen
,
or
the
curricle-drivers
of
the
morning
.
His
name
*NL*
was
not
in
the
pump-room
book
,
and
curiosity
could
do
no
more
.
He
must
*NL*
be
gone
from
Bath
.
Yet
he
had
not
mentioned
that
his
stay
would
be
so
*NL*
short
!
This
sort
of
mysteriousness
,
which
is
always
so
becoming
in
a
*NL*
hero
,
threw
a
fresh
grace
in
Catherine
's
imagination
around
his
person
*NL*
and
manners
,
and
increased
her
anxiety
to
know
more
of
him
.
From
the
*NL*
Thorpes
she
could
learn
nothing
,
for
they
had
been
only
two
days
in
Bath
*NL*
before
they
met
with
Mrs.
Allen
.
It
was
a
subject
,
however
,
in
which
*NL*
she
often
indulged
with
her
fair
friend
,
from
whom
she
received
every
*NL*
possible
encouragement
to
continue
to
think
of
him
;
and
his
impression
*NL*
on
her
fancy
was
not
suffered
therefore
to
weaken
.
Isabella
was
very
*NL*
sure
that
he
must
be
a
charming
young
man
,
and
was
equally
sure
that
he
*NL*
must
have
been
delighted
with
her
dear
Catherine
,
and
would
therefore
*NL*
shortly
return
.
She
liked
him
the
better
for
being
a
clergyman
,
``
for
she
*NL*
must
confess
herself
very
partial
to
the
profession
''
;
and
something
like
*NL*
a
sigh
escaped
her
as
she
said
it
.
Perhaps
Catherine
was
wrong
in
not
*NL*
demanding
the
cause
of
that
gentle
emotion
--
but
she
was
not
experienced
*NL*
enough
in
the
finesse
of
love
,
or
the
duties
of
friendship
,
to
know
when
*NL*
delicate
raillery
was
properly
called
for
,
or
when
a
confidence
should
*NL*
be
forced
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Allen
was
now
quite
happy
--
quite
satisfied
with
Bath
.
She
had
found
*NL*
some
acquaintance
,
had
been
so
lucky
too
as
to
find
in
them
the
family
*NL*
of
a
most
worthy
old
friend
;
and
,
as
the
completion
of
good
fortune
,
had
*NL*
found
these
friends
by
no
means
so
expensively
dressed
as
herself
.
Her
*NL*
daily
expressions
were
no
longer
,
``
I
wish
we
had
some
acquaintance
in
*NL*
Bath
!
''
They
were
changed
into
,
``
How
glad
I
am
we
have
met
with
Mrs.
*NL*
Thorpe
!
''
and
she
was
as
eager
in
promoting
the
intercourse
of
the
two
*NL*
families
,
as
her
young
charge
and
Isabella
themselves
could
be
;
never
*NL*
satisfied
with
the
day
unless
she
spent
the
chief
of
it
by
the
side
of
*NL*
Mrs.
Thorpe
,
in
what
they
called
conversation
,
but
in
which
there
was
*NL*
scarcely
ever
any
exchange
of
opinion
,
and
not
often
any
resemblance
of
*NL*
subject
,
for
Mrs.
Thorpe
talked
chiefly
of
her
children
,
and
Mrs.
Allen
*NL*
of
her
gowns
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
progress
of
the
friendship
between
Catherine
and
Isabella
was
quick
*NL*
as
its
beginning
had
been
warm
,
and
they
passed
so
rapidly
through
every
*NL*
gradation
of
increasing
tenderness
that
there
was
shortly
no
fresh
proof
*NL*
of
it
to
be
given
to
their
friends
or
themselves
.
They
called
each
other
*NL*
by
their
Christian
name
,
were
always
arm
in
arm
when
they
walked
,
pinned
*NL*
up
each
other
's
train
for
the
dance
,
and
were
not
to
be
divided
in
the
*NL*
set
;
and
if
a
rainy
morning
deprived
them
of
other
enjoyments
,
they
*NL*
were
still
resolute
in
meeting
in
defiance
of
wet
and
dirt
,
and
shut
*NL*
themselves
up
,
to
read
novels
together
.
Yes
,
novels
;
for
I
will
not
*NL*
adopt
that
ungenerous
and
impolitic
custom
so
common
with
novel-writers
,
*NL*
of
degrading
by
their
contemptuous
censure
the
very
performances
,
to
the
*NL*
number
of
which
they
are
themselves
adding
--
joining
with
their
greatest
*NL*
enemies
in
bestowing
the
harshest
epithets
on
such
works
,
and
scarcely
*NL*
ever
permitting
them
to
be
read
by
their
own
heroine
,
who
,
if
she
*NL*
accidentally
take
up
a
novel
,
is
sure
to
turn
over
its
insipid
pages
*NL*
with
disgust
.
Alas
!
If
the
heroine
of
one
novel
be
not
patronized
by
the
*NL*
heroine
of
another
,
from
whom
can
she
expect
protection
and
regard
?
I
*NL*
can
not
approve
of
it
.
Let
us
leave
it
to
the
reviewers
to
abuse
such
*NL*
effusions
of
fancy
at
their
leisure
,
and
over
every
new
novel
to
talk
in
*NL*
threadbare
strains
of
the
trash
with
which
the
press
now
groans
.
Let
us
*NL*
not
desert
one
another
;
we
are
an
injured
body
.
Although
our
productions
*NL*
have
afforded
more
extensive
and
unaffected
pleasure
than
those
of
any
*NL*
other
literary
corporation
in
the
world
,
no
species
of
composition
has
*NL*
been
so
much
decried
.
From
pride
,
ignorance
,
or
fashion
,
our
foes
*NL*
are
almost
as
many
as
our
readers
.
And
while
the
abilities
of
the
*NL*
nine-hundredth
abridger
of
the
History
of
England
,
or
of
the
man
who
*NL*
collects
and
publishes
in
a
volume
some
dozen
lines
of
Milton
,
Pope
,
and
*NL*
Prior
,
with
a
paper
from
the
Spectator
,
and
a
chapter
from
Sterne
,
*NL*
are
eulogized
by
a
thousand
pens
--
there
seems
almost
a
general
wish
of
*NL*
decrying
the
capacity
and
undervaluing
the
labour
of
the
novelist
,
and
*NL*
of
slighting
the
performances
which
have
only
genius
,
wit
,
and
taste
to
*NL*
recommend
them
.
``
I
am
no
novel-reader
--
I
seldom
look
into
novels
--
Do
not
*NL*
imagine
that
I
often
read
novels
--
It
is
really
very
well
for
a
novel
.
''
*NL*
Such
is
the
common
cant
.
``
And
what
are
you
reading
,
Miss
--
?
''
``
Oh
!
It
is
*NL*
only
a
novel
!
''
replies
the
young
lady
,
while
she
lays
down
her
book
*NL*
with
affected
indifference
,
or
momentary
shame
.
``
It
is
only
Cecilia
,
or
*NL*
Camilla
,
or
Belinda
''
;
or
,
in
short
,
only
some
work
in
which
the
greatest
*NL*
powers
of
the
mind
are
displayed
,
in
which
the
most
thorough
knowledge
*NL*
of
human
nature
,
the
happiest
delineation
of
its
varieties
,
the
*NL*
liveliest
effusions
of
wit
and
humour
,
are
conveyed
to
the
world
in
the
*NL*
best-chosen
language
.
Now
,
had
the
same
young
lady
been
engaged
with
a
*NL*
volume
of
the
Spectator
,
instead
of
such
a
work
,
how
proudly
would
she
*NL*
have
produced
the
book
,
and
told
its
name
;
though
the
chances
must
be
*NL*
against
her
being
occupied
by
any
part
of
that
voluminous
publication
,
*NL*
of
which
either
the
matter
or
manner
would
not
disgust
a
young
person
of
*NL*
taste
:
the
substance
of
its
papers
so
often
consisting
in
the
statement
*NL*
of
improbable
circumstances
,
unnatural
characters
,
and
topics
of
*NL*
conversation
which
no
longer
concern
anyone
living
;
and
their
language
,
*NL*
too
,
frequently
so
coarse
as
to
give
no
very
favourable
idea
of
the
age
*NL*

CHAPTER
6
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
following
conversation
,
which
took
place
between
the
two
friends
in
*NL*
the
pump-room
one
morning
,
after
an
acquaintance
of
eight
or
nine
*NL*
days
,
is
given
as
a
specimen
of
their
very
warm
attachment
,
and
of
the
*NL*
delicacy
,
discretion
,
originality
of
thought
,
and
literary
taste
which
*NL*
marked
the
reasonableness
of
that
attachment
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
met
by
appointment
;
and
as
Isabella
had
arrived
nearly
five
*NL*
minutes
before
her
friend
,
her
first
address
naturally
was
,
``
My
dearest
*NL*
creature
,
what
can
have
made
you
so
late
?
I
have
been
waiting
for
you
at
*NL*
least
this
age
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
,
indeed
!
I
am
very
sorry
for
it
;
but
really
I
thought
I
was
in
*NL*
very
good
time
.
It
is
but
just
one
.
I
hope
you
have
not
been
here
long
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
These
ten
ages
at
least
.
I
am
sure
I
have
been
here
this
half
hour
.
*NL*
But
now
,
let
us
go
and
sit
down
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
,
and
enjoy
*NL*
ourselves
.
I
have
an
hundred
things
to
say
to
you
.
In
the
first
place
,
*NL*
I
was
so
afraid
it
would
rain
this
morning
,
just
as
I
wanted
to
set
off
;
*NL*
it
looked
very
showery
,
and
that
would
have
thrown
me
into
agonies
!
Do
*NL*
you
know
,
I
saw
the
prettiest
hat
you
can
imagine
,
in
a
shop
window
in
*NL*
Milsom
Street
just
now
--
very
like
yours
,
only
with
coquelicot
ribbons
*NL*
instead
of
green
;
I
quite
longed
for
it
.
But
,
my
dearest
Catherine
,
what
*NL*
have
you
been
doing
with
yourself
all
this
morning
?
Have
you
gone
on
*NL*
with
Udolpho
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
have
been
reading
it
ever
since
I
woke
;
and
I
am
got
to
the
*NL*
black
veil
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
,
indeed
?
How
delightful
!
Oh
!
I
would
not
tell
you
what
is
*NL*
behind
the
black
veil
for
the
world
!
Are
not
you
wild
to
know
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
Yes
,
quite
;
what
can
it
be
?
But
do
not
tell
me
--
I
would
not
be
*NL*
told
upon
any
account
.
I
know
it
must
be
a
skeleton
,
I
am
sure
it
is
*NL*
Laurentina
's
skeleton
.
Oh
!
I
am
delighted
with
the
book
!
I
should
like
*NL*
to
spend
my
whole
life
in
reading
it
.
I
assure
you
,
if
it
had
not
been
*NL*
to
meet
you
,
I
would
not
have
come
away
from
it
for
all
the
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
creature
!
How
much
I
am
obliged
to
you
;
and
when
you
have
finished
*NL*
Udolpho
,
we
will
read
the
Italian
together
;
and
I
have
made
out
a
list
*NL*
of
ten
or
twelve
more
of
the
same
kind
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
,
indeed
!
How
glad
I
am
!
What
are
they
all
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
read
you
their
names
directly
;
here
they
are
,
in
my
pocketbook
.
*NL*
Castle
of
Wolfenbach
,
Clermont
,
Mysterious
Warnings
,
Necromancer
of
the
*NL*
Black
Forest
,
Midnight
Bell
,
Orphan
of
the
Rhine
,
and
Horrid
Mysteries
.
*NL*
Those
will
last
us
some
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
pretty
well
;
but
are
they
all
horrid
,
are
you
sure
they
are
all
*NL*
horrid
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
quite
sure
;
for
a
particular
friend
of
mine
,
a
Miss
Andrews
,
a
*NL*
sweet
girl
,
one
of
the
sweetest
creatures
in
the
world
,
has
read
every
*NL*
one
of
them
.
I
wish
you
knew
Miss
Andrews
,
you
would
be
delighted
with
*NL*
her
.
She
is
netting
herself
the
sweetest
cloak
you
can
conceive
.
I
think
*NL*
her
as
beautiful
as
an
angel
,
and
I
am
so
vexed
with
the
men
for
not
*NL*
admiring
her
!
I
scold
them
all
amazingly
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Scold
them
!
Do
you
scold
them
for
not
admiring
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
that
I
do
.
There
is
nothing
I
would
not
do
for
those
who
are
*NL*
really
my
friends
.
I
have
no
notion
of
loving
people
by
halves
;
it
is
*NL*
not
my
nature
.
My
attachments
are
always
excessively
strong
.
I
told
*NL*
Captain
Hunt
at
one
of
our
assemblies
this
winter
that
if
he
was
to
*NL*
tease
me
all
night
,
I
would
not
dance
with
him
,
unless
he
would
allow
*NL*
Miss
Andrews
to
be
as
beautiful
as
an
angel
.
The
men
think
us
incapable
*NL*
of
real
friendship
,
you
know
,
and
I
am
determined
to
show
them
the
*NL*
difference
.
Now
,
if
I
were
to
hear
anybody
speak
slightingly
of
you
,
I
*NL*
should
fire
up
in
a
moment
:
but
that
is
not
at
all
likely
,
for
you
are
*NL*
just
the
kind
of
girl
to
be
a
great
favourite
with
the
men
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
dear
!
''
cried
Catherine
,
colouring
.
``
How
can
you
say
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
you
very
well
;
you
have
so
much
animation
,
which
is
exactly
*NL*
what
Miss
Andrews
wants
,
for
I
must
confess
there
is
something
amazingly
*NL*
insipid
about
her
.
Oh
!
I
must
tell
you
,
that
just
after
we
parted
*NL*
yesterday
,
I
saw
a
young
man
looking
at
you
so
earnestly
--
I
am
sure
he
*NL*
is
in
love
with
you
.
''
Catherine
coloured
,
and
disclaimed
again
.
Isabella
*NL*
laughed
.
``
It
is
very
true
,
upon
my
honour
,
but
I
see
how
it
is
;
you
are
*NL*
indifferent
to
everybody
's
admiration
,
except
that
of
one
gentleman
,
*NL*
who
shall
be
nameless
.
Nay
,
I
can
not
blame
you
''
--
speaking
more
*NL*
seriously
--
``
your
feelings
are
easily
understood
.
Where
the
heart
is
*NL*
really
attached
,
I
know
very
well
how
little
one
can
be
pleased
with
the
*NL*
attention
of
anybody
else
.
Everything
is
so
insipid
,
so
uninteresting
,
*NL*
that
does
not
relate
to
the
beloved
object
!
I
can
perfectly
comprehend
*NL*
your
feelings
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
should
not
persuade
me
that
I
think
so
very
much
about
Mr.
*NL*
Tilney
,
for
perhaps
I
may
never
see
him
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
see
him
again
!
My
dearest
creature
,
do
not
talk
of
it
.
I
am
sure
*NL*
you
would
be
miserable
if
you
thought
so
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
indeed
,
I
should
not

I
do
not
pretend
to
say
that
I
was
not
very
*NL*
much
pleased
with
him
;
but
while
I
have
Udolpho
to
read
,
I
feel
as
if
*NL*
nobody
could
make
me
miserable
.
Oh
!
The
dreadful
black
veil
!
My
dear
*NL*
Isabella
,
I
am
sure
there
must
be
Laurentina
's
skeleton
behind
it
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
so
odd
to
me
,
that
you
should
never
have
read
Udolpho
before
;
but
*NL*
I
suppose
Mrs.
Morland
objects
to
novels
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
she
does
not
.
She
very
often
reads
Sir
Charles
Grandison
herself
;
*NL*
but
new
books
do
not
fall
in
our
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
Charles
Grandison
!
That
is
an
amazing
horrid
book

is
it
not
?
I
*NL*
remember
Miss
Andrews
could
not
get
through
the
first
volume
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
not
like
Udolpho
at
all
;
but
yet
I
think
it
is
very
*NL*
entertaining
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
indeed

You
surprise
me
;
I
thought
it
had
not
been
readable

*NL*
But
,
my
dearest
Catherine
,
have
you
settled
what
to
wear
on
your
head
*NL*
tonight
?
I
am
determined
at
all
events
to
be
dressed
exactly
like
you
.
*NL*
The
men
take
notice
of
that
sometimes
,
you
know

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
does
not
signify
if
they
do
,

said
Catherine
,
very
innocently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Signify
!
Oh
,
heavens
!
I
make
it
a
rule
never
to
mind
what
they
say
.
*NL*
They
are
very
often
amazingly
impertinent
if
you
do
not
treat
them
with
*NL*
spirit
,
and
make
them
keep
their
distance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
they
?
Well

I
never
observed
that

They
always
behave
very
well
to
*NL*
me

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
They
give
themselves
such
airs

They
are
the
most
conceited
*NL*
creatures
in
the
world

and
think
themselves
of
so
much
importance
!
*NL*
By
the
by
,
though
I
have
thought
of
it
a
hundred
times
,
I
have
always
*NL*
forgot
to
ask
you
what
is
your
favourite
complexion
in
a
man

Do
you
*NL*
like
them
best
dark
or
fair
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hardly
know

I
never
much
thought
about
it

Something
between
both

I
*NL*
think

Brown

not
fair
,
and
--
and
not
very
dark
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well

Catherine

That
is
exactly
he

I
have
not
forgot
your
*NL*
description
of
Mr.

--

a
brown
skin
,
with
dark
eyes
,
and
rather
*NL*
dark
hair
.

Well
,
my
taste
is
different

I
prefer
light
eyes
,
and
as
to
*NL*
complexion
--
do
you
know
--
I
like
a
sallow
better
than
any
other
.
You
must
*NL*
not
betray
me
,
if
you
should
ever
meet
with
one
of
your
acquaintance

answering
that
description

not

said
too
much

Let
us
drop
*NL*
the
subject

''
*NL*
*NL*
Catherine
,
in
some
amazement
,
complied
,
and
after
remaining
a
few
*NL*
moments
silent
,
was
on
the
point
of
reverting
to
what
interested
her
*NL*
at
that
time
rather
more
than
anything
else
in
the
world
,
Laurentina
's
*NL*
skeleton
,
when
her
friend
prevented
her
,
by
saying
,
``
For
heaven
's
sake
!
*NL*
Let
us
move
away
from
this
end
of
the
room
.
Do
you
know
,
there
are
two
*NL*
odious
young
men
who
have
been
staring
at
me
this
half
hour
.
They
really
*NL*
put
me
quite
out
of
countenance
.
Let
us
go
and
look
at
the
arrivals
.
*NL*
They
will
hardly
follow
us
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Away
they
walked
to
the
book
;
and
while
Isabella
examined
the
names
,
it
*NL*
was
Catherine
's
employment
to
watch
the
proceedings
of
these
alarming
*NL*
young
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
not
coming
this
way

are
they

I
hope
they
are
not
so

impertinent

follow
us

Pray
let
me
know
if
they
are
coming

I
am
*NL*
determined
I
will
not
look
up

*NL*
*NL*
In
a
few
moments
Catherine
,
with
unaffected
pleasure
,
assured
her
*NL*
that
she
need
not
be
longer
uneasy
,
as
the
gentlemen
had
just
left
the
*NL*
pump-room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
which
way
are
they
gone
?
''
said
Isabella
,
turning
hastily
round
.
*NL*
``
One
was
a
very
good-looking
young
man
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
They
went
towards
the
church-yard
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
am
amazingly
glad
I
have
got
rid
of
them

And
now

what
say
you
*NL*
to
going
to
Edgar
's
Buildings
with
me
,
and
looking
at
my
new
hat
?
You
*NL*
said
you
should
like
to
see
it

*NL*
*NL*
Catherine
readily
agreed
.
``
Only
,
''
she
added
,
``
perhaps
we
may
overtake
*NL*
the
two
young
men

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

Never

that

make

am
dying
to
show
you
my
hat

*NL*
``

if

only
wait
a

minutes

seeing
them
at
all

*NL*
``

no

treating

with
such
respect

That
is
the
way
to
spoil

them

''
*NL*
*NL*
Catherine
had
nothing
to
oppose
against
such
reasoning
;
and
therefore
,
*NL*
to
show
the
independence
of
Miss
Thorpe
,
and
her
resolution
of
humbling
*NL*
the
sex
,
they
set
off
immediately
as
fast
as
they
could
walk

in
pursuit

two

CHAPTER
7
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Half
a
minute
conducted
them
through
the
pump-yard
to
the
archway
,
*NL*
opposite
Union
Passage
;
but
here
they
were
stopped
.
Everybody
acquainted
*NL*
with
Bath
may
remember
the
difficulties
of
crossing
Cheap
Street
at
*NL*
this
point
;
it
is
indeed
a
street
of
so
impertinent
a
nature
,
so
*NL*
unfortunately
connected
with
the
great
London
and
Oxford
roads
,
and
the
*NL*
principal
inn
of
the
city
,
that
a
day
never
passes
in
which
parties
of
*NL*
ladies
,
however
important
their
business
,
whether
in
quest
of
pastry
,
*NL*
millinery
,
or
even
-LRB-
as
in
the
present
case
-RRB-
of
young
men
,
are
not
*NL*
detained
on
one
side
or
other
by
carriages
,
horsemen
,
or
carts
.
This
*NL*
evil
had
been
felt
and
lamented
,
at
least
three
times
a
day
,
by
Isabella
*NL*
since
her
residence
in
Bath
;
and
she
was
now
fated
to
feel
and
lament
it
*NL*
once
more
,
for
at
the
very
moment
of
coming
opposite
to
Union
Passage
,
*NL*
and
within
view
of
the
two
gentlemen
who
were
proceeding
through
the
*NL*
crowds
,
and
threading
the
gutters
of
that
interesting
alley
,
they
*NL*
were
prevented
crossing
by
the
approach
of
a
gig
,
driven
along
on
bad
*NL*
pavement
by
a
most
knowing-looking
coachman
with
all
the
vehemence
that
*NL*
could
most
fitly
endanger
the
lives
of
himself
,
his
companion
,
and
his
*NL*
horse
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
these
odious
gigs
!
''
said
Isabella
,
looking
up
.
``
How
I
detest
them
.
''
*NL*
But
this
detestation
,
though
so
just
,
was
of
short
duration
,
for
she
*NL*
looked
again
and
exclaimed
,
``
Delightful
!
Mr.
Morland
and
my
brother
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
heaven
!
'T
is
James
!
''
was
uttered
at
the
same
moment
by
Catherine
;
*NL*
and
,
on
catching
the
young
men
's
eyes
,
the
horse
was
immediately
checked
*NL*
with
a
violence
which
almost
threw
him
on
his
haunches
,
and
the
servant
*NL*
having
now
scampered
up
,
the
gentlemen
jumped
out
,
and
the
equipage
was
*NL*
delivered
to
his
care
.
*NL*
*NL*
Catherine
,
by
whom
this
meeting
was
wholly
unexpected
,
received
her
*NL*
brother
with
the
liveliest
pleasure
;
and
he
,
being
of
a
very
amiable
*NL*
disposition
,
and
sincerely
attached
to
her
,
gave
every
proof
on
his
*NL*
side
of
equal
satisfaction
,
which
he
could
have
leisure
to
do
,
while
the
*NL*
bright
eyes
of
Miss
Thorpe
were
incessantly
challenging
his
notice
;
*NL*
and
to
her
his
devoirs
were
speedily
paid
,
with
a
mixture
of
joy
and
*NL*
embarrassment
which
might
have
informed
Catherine
,
had
she
been
more
*NL*
expert
in
the
development
of
other
people
's
feelings
,
and
less
simply
*NL*
engrossed
by
her
own
,
that
her
brother
thought
her
friend
quite
as
*NL*
pretty
as
she
could
do
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
John
Thorpe
,
who
in
the
meantime
had
been
giving
orders
about
the
*NL*
horses
,
soon
joined
them
,
and
from
him
she
directly
received
the
amends
*NL*
which
were
her
due
;
for
while
he
slightly
and
carelessly
touched
the
*NL*
hand
of
Isabella
,
on
her
he
bestowed
a
whole
scrape
and
half
a
short
*NL*
bow
.
He
was
a
stout
young
man
of
middling
height
,
who
,
with
a
plain
face
*NL*
and
ungraceful
form
,
seemed
fearful
of
being
too
handsome
unless
he
wore
*NL*
the
dress
of
a
groom
,
and
too
much
like
a
gentleman
unless
he
were
easy
*NL*
where
he
ought
to
be
civil
,
and
impudent
where
he
might
be
allowed
to
be
*NL*
easy
.
He
took
out
his
watch
:
``
How
long
do
you
think
we
have
been
running
*NL*
it
from
Tetbury
,
Miss
Morland
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
know
the
distance
.
''
Her
brother
told
her
that
it
was
*NL*
twenty-three
miles
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Three
and
twenty
!
''
cried
Thorpe
.
``
Five
and
twenty
if
it
is
an
inch
.
''
*NL*
Morland
remonstrated
,
pleaded
the
authority
of
road-books
,
innkeepers
,
*NL*
and
milestones
;
but
his
friend
disregarded
them
all
;
he
had
a
surer
test
*NL*
of
distance
.
``
I
know
it
must
be
five
and
twenty
,
''
said
he
,
``
by
the
time
*NL*
we
have
been
doing
it
.
It
is
now
half
after
one
;
we
drove
out
of
the
*NL*
inn-yard
at
Tetbury
as
the
town
clock
struck
eleven
;
and
I
defy
any
man
*NL*
in
England
to
make
my
horse
go
less
than
ten
miles
an
hour
in
harness
;
*NL*
that
makes
it
exactly
twenty-five
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
lost
an
hour
,
''
said
Morland
;
``
it
was
only
ten
o'clock
when
we
*NL*
came
from
Tetbury
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ten
o'clock
!
It
was
eleven
,
upon
my
soul
!
I
counted
every
stroke
.
This
*NL*
brother
of
yours
would
persuade
me
out
of
my
senses
,
Miss
Morland
;
do
*NL*
but
look
at
my
horse
;
did
you
ever
see
an
animal
so
made
for
speed
in
*NL*
your
life
?
''
-LRB-
The
servant
had
just
mounted
the
carriage
and
was
driving
*NL*
off
.
-RRB-
``
Such
true
blood
!
Three
hours
and
and
a
half
indeed
coming
only
*NL*
three
and
twenty
miles
!
Look
at
that
creature
,
and
suppose
it
possible
*NL*
if
you
can

*NL*
*NL*
``
He
does
look
very
hot
,
to
be
sure

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hot
!
He
had
not
turned
a
hair
till
we
came
to
Walcot
Church
;
but
look
*NL*
at
his
forehand
;
look
at
his
loins
;
only
see
how
he
moves
;
that
horse
*NL*
can
not
go
less
than
ten
miles
an
hour
:
tie
his
legs
and
he
will
get
on
.
*NL*
What
do
you
think
of
my
gig
,
Miss
Morland
?
A
neat
one
,
is
not
it
?
*NL*
Well
hung
;
town-built
;
I
have
not
had
it
a
month
.
It
was
built
for
a
*NL*
Christchurch
man
,
a
friend
of
mine
,
a
very
good
sort
of
fellow
;
he
ran
*NL*
it
a
few
weeks
,
till
,
I
believe
,
it
was
convenient
to
have
done
with
it
.
*NL*
I
happened
just
then
to
be
looking
out
for
some
light
thing
of
the
kind
,
*NL*
though
I
had
pretty
well
determined
on
a
curricle
too
;
but
I
chanced
to
*NL*
meet
him
on
Magdalen
Bridge
,
as
he
was
driving
into
Oxford
,
last
term
:
*NL*
`
Ah
!
Thorpe
,
'
said
he
,
`
do
you
happen
to
want
such
a
little
thing
as
*NL*
this
?
It
is
a
capital
one
of
the
kind
,
but
I
am
cursed
tired
of
it
.
'
*NL*
`
Oh
!
D
--
,
'
said
I
;
'
I
am
your
man
;
what
do
you
ask
?
'
And
how
much
do
you
*NL*
think
he
did
,
Miss
Morland
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sure
I
can
not
guess
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Curricle-hung
,
you
see
;
seat
,
trunk
,
sword-case
,
splashing-board
,
*NL*
lamps
,
silver
moulding
,
all
you
see
complete
;
the
iron-work
as
good
*NL*
as
new
,
or
better
.
He
asked
fifty
guineas
;
I
closed
with
him
directly
,
*NL*
threw
down
the
money
,
and
the
carriage
was
mine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
am
sure
,
''
said
Catherine
,
``
I
know
so
little
of
such
things
that
I
*NL*
can
not
judge
whether
it
was
cheap
or
dear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Neither
one
nor
t
`
other
;
I
might
have
got
it
for
less
,
I
dare
say
;
but
*NL*
I
hate
haggling
,
and
poor
Freeman
wanted
cash
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
was
very
good-natured
of
you
,

said
Catherine
,
quite
pleased
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
D

it
,
when
one
has
the
means
of
doing
a
kind
thing
by
a
friend

*NL*
I
hate
to
be
pitiful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
An
inquiry
now
took
place
into
the
intended
movements
of
the
young
*NL*
ladies
;
and
,
on
finding
whither
they
were
going
,
it
was
decided
that
*NL*
the
gentlemen
should
accompany
them
to
Edgar
's
Buildings
,
and
pay
their
*NL*
respects
to
Mrs.
Thorpe
.
James
and
Isabella
led
the
way
;
and
so
*NL*
well
satisfied
was
the
latter
with
her
lot
,
so
contentedly
was
she
*NL*
endeavouring
to
ensure
a
pleasant
walk
to
him
who
brought
the
double
*NL*
recommendation
of
being
her
brother
's
friend
,
and
her
friend
's
brother
,
*NL*
so
pure
and
uncoquettish
were
her
feelings
,
that
,
though
they
overtook
*NL*
and
passed
the
two
offending
young
men
in
Milsom
Street
,
she
was
so
far
*NL*
from
seeking
to
attract
their
notice
,
that
she
looked
back
at
them
only
*NL*
three
times
.
*NL*
*NL*
John
Thorpe
kept
of
course
with
Catherine
,
and
,
after
a
few
minutes
'
*NL*
silence
,
renewed
the
conversation
about
his
gig
.
``
You
will
find
,
*NL*
however
,
Miss
Morland
,
it
would
be
reckoned
a
cheap
thing
by
some
*NL*
people
,
for
I
might
have
sold
it
for
ten
guineas
more
the
next
day
;
*NL*
Jackson
,
of
Oriel
,
bid
me
sixty
at
once
;
Morland
was
with
me
at
the
*NL*
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Morland
,
who
overheard
this
;
``
but
you
forget
that
your
horse
*NL*
was
included
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
horse
!
Oh
,
d

it
!
I
would
not
sell
my
horse
for
a
hundred

Are
*NL*
you
fond
of
an
open
carriage
,
Miss
Morland
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
very
;
I
have
hardly
ever
an
opportunity
of
being
in
one
;
but
I
am
*NL*
particularly
fond
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
glad
of
it
;
I
will
drive
you
out
in
mine
every
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
''
said
Catherine
,
in
some
distress
,
from
a
doubt
of
the
*NL*
propriety
of
accepting
such
an
offer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
drive
you
up
Lansdown
Hill
tomorrow

*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you

will
not
your
horse
want
rest

*NL*
*NL*
``
Rest

has
only
come
three
and
twenty
miles
today
;
all
nonsense
;
*NL*
nothing
ruins
horses
so
much
as
rest
;
nothing
knocks
them
up
so
soon
.
*NL*
No
,
no
;
I
shall
exercise
mine
at
the
average
of
four
hours
every
day
*NL*
while
I
am
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
you
indeed
!
''
said
Catherine
very
seriously
.
``
That
will
be
forty
*NL*
miles
a
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Forty
!
Aye
,
fifty

for
what
I
care
.
Well
,
I
will
drive
you
up
Lansdown
*NL*
tomorrow
;
mind
,
I
am
engaged
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
delightful
that
will
be
!
''
cried
Isabella
,
turning
round
.
``
My
*NL*
dearest
Catherine
,
I
quite
envy
you
;
but
I
am
afraid

will
*NL*
not
have
room
for
a
third
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
third
indeed
!
No
,
no
;
I
did
not
come
to
Bath
to
drive
my
sisters
*NL*
about

that
would
be
a
good
joke
,
faith
!
Morland
must
take
care
of
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
brought
on
a
dialogue
of
civilities
between
the
other
two
;
but
*NL*
Catherine
heard
neither
the
particulars
nor
the
result
.
Her
companion
's
*NL*
discourse
now
sunk
from
its
hitherto
animated
pitch
to
nothing
more
than
*NL*
a
short
decisive
sentence
of
praise
or
condemnation
on
the
face
of
every
*NL*
woman
they
met
;
and
Catherine
,
after
listening
and
agreeing
as
long
as
*NL*
she
could
,
with
all
the
civility
and
deference
of
the
youthful
female
*NL*
mind
,
fearful
of
hazarding
an
opinion
of
its
own
in
opposition
to
that
*NL*
of
a
self-assured
man
,
especially
where
the
beauty
of
her
own
sex
is
*NL*
concerned
,
ventured
at
length
to
vary
the
subject
by
a
question
which
*NL*
had
been
long
uppermost
in
her
thoughts
;
it
was
,
``
Have
you
ever
read
*NL*
Udolpho
,
Mr.
Thorpe
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Udolpho
!
Oh
,
Lord
!
Not
I
;
I
never
read
novels
;
I
have
something
else
to
*NL*
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Catherine
,
humbled
and
ashamed
,
was
going
to
apologize
for
her
question
,
*NL*
but
he
prevented
her
by
saying
,
``
Novels
are
all
so
full
of
nonsense

and
stuff

there
has
not
been
a
tolerably
decent
one

out
since

Tom
Jones

except
The
Monk

I
read
that
t

other
day

as
for
all
the

they
are
the
stupidest
things

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
I

No

I
read
any

it
shall
be
Mrs.
Radcliffe

novels
are
amusing
enough

they
are
worth
reading

some
fun

nature

in
them

*NL*
*NL*
``
Udolpho
was
written
by
Mrs.

with
some

hesitation

from
the
fear

mortifying
him

*NL*
*NL*
``
No
sure

was
it

I
remember

so
it
was

other
stupid
book

written
by
that
woman
they
make
such
a
fuss
about

playing
at

see-saw

took
up
the
first
volume
once
and
looked
it
over
,
but
I
soon
*NL*
found
it
would
not
do
;
indeed
I
guessed
what
sort
of
stuff
it
must
be

before
I
saw
it
:
as
soon
as
I
heard
she
had
married
an
emigrant

I
was
*NL*
sure
I
should
never
be
able
to
get
through
it

*NL*
``
I
have
never

*NL*
``
You
had
no

assure
you
;
it
is
the
horridest
nonsense
you
can

imagine

is
nothing
in
the
world
in
it

an
old
man

playing
at

see-saw
and
learning
Latin

my
soul
there

not

''
*NL*
*NL*
This
critique
,
the
justness
of
which
was
unfortunately
lost
on
poor
*NL*
Catherine
,
brought
them
to
the
door
of
Mrs.
Thorpe
's
lodgings
,
and
the
*NL*
feelings
of
the
discerning
and
unprejudiced
reader
of
Camilla
gave
way
*NL*
to
the
feelings
of
the
dutiful
and
affectionate
son
,
as
they
met
Mrs.
*NL*
Thorpe
,
who
had
descried
them
from
above
,
in
the
passage
.
``
Ah
,
Mother
!
*NL*
How
do
you
do

said
he
,
giving
her
a
hearty
shake
of
the
hand
.
``
Where
*NL*
did
you
get
that
quiz
of
a
hat

It
makes

look

Morland

come

stay
a

days
with
you

so
you
must
look
*NL*
out
for
a
couple
of
good
beds
somewhere
near

And
this
address
seemed
*NL*
to
satisfy
all
the
fondest
wishes
of
the
mother
's
heart
,
for
she
*NL*
received
him
with
the
most
delighted
and
exulting
affection
.
On
his
*NL*
two
younger
sisters
he
then
bestowed
an
equal
portion
of
his
fraternal
*NL*
tenderness
,
for
he
asked
each
of
them
how
they
did
,
and
observed
that
*NL*
they
both
looked
very
ugly
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
manners
did
not
please
Catherine
;
but
he
was
James
's
friend
*NL*
and
Isabella
's
brother
;
and
her
judgment
was
further
bought
off
by
*NL*
Isabella
's
assuring
her
,
when
they
withdrew
to
see
the
new
hat
,
that
*NL*
John
thought
her
the
most
charming
girl
in
the
world
,
and
by
John
's
*NL*
engaging
her
before
they
parted
to
dance
with
him
that
evening
.
Had
she
*NL*
been
older
or
vainer
,
such
attacks
might
have
done
little
;
but
,
where
*NL*
youth
and
diffidence
are
united
,
it
requires
uncommon
steadiness
of
*NL*
reason
to
resist
the
attraction
of
being
called
the
most
charming
girl
*NL*
in
the
world
,
and
of
being
so
very
early
engaged
as
a
partner
;
and
the
*NL*
consequence
was
that
,
when
the
two
Morlands
,
after
sitting
an
hour
with
*NL*
the
Thorpes
,
set
off
to
walk
together
to
Mr.
Allen
's
,
and
James
,
as
*NL*
the
door
was
closed
on
them
,
said
,
``
Well
,
Catherine
,
how
do
you
like
my
*NL*
friend
Thorpe
?
''
instead
of
answering
,
as
she
probably
would
have
done
,
*NL*
had
there
been
no
friendship
and
no
flattery
in
the
case
,
``
I
do
not
like
*NL*
him
at
all
,
''
she
directly
replied
,
``
I
like
him
very
much
;
he
seems
very
*NL*
agreeable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
as
good-natured
a
fellow
as
ever
lived
;
a
little
of
a
rattle
;
but
*NL*
that
will
recommend
him
to
your
sex
,
I
believe
:
and
how
do
you
like
the
*NL*
rest
of
the
family
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
,
very
much
indeed
:
Isabella
particularly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
glad
to
hear
you
say
so
;
she
is
just
the
kind
of
young
woman
*NL*
I
could
wish
to
see
you
attached
to
;
she
has
so
much
good
sense
,
and
is
*NL*
so
thoroughly
unaffected
and
amiable
;
I
always
wanted
you
to
know
her
;
*NL*
and
she
seems
very
fond
of
you
.
She
said
the
highest
things
in
your
*NL*
praise
that
could
possibly
be
;
and
the
praise
of
such
a
girl
as
Miss
*NL*
Thorpe
even
you
,
Catherine
,
''
taking
her
hand
with
affection
,
``
may
be
*NL*
proud
of
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
I
am
,
''
she
replied
;
``
I
love
her
exceedingly
,
and
am
delighted
*NL*
to
find
that
you
like
her
too

You
hardly
mentioned
anything
of
her
when
*NL*
you
wrote
to
me
after
your
visit
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
I
thought
I
should
soon
see
you
myself
.
I
hope
you
will
be
a
*NL*
great
deal
together
while
you
are
in
Bath
.
She
is
a
most
amiable
girl
;
*NL*
such
a
superior
understanding
!
How
fond
all
the
family
are
of
her
;
she
*NL*
is
evidently
the
general
favourite
;
and
how
much
she
must
be
admired
in
*NL*
such
a
place
as
this
--
is
not
she
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
very
much
indeed
,
I
fancy
;
Mr.
Allen
thinks
her
the
prettiest
girl
*NL*
in
Bath
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
dare
say
he
does
;
and
I
do
not
know
any
man
who
is
a
better
judge
of
*NL*
beauty
than
Mr.
Allen
.
I
need
not
ask
you
whether
you
are
happy
here
,
my
*NL*
dear
Catherine
;
with
such
a
companion
and
friend
as
Isabella
Thorpe
,
it
*NL*
would
be
impossible
for
you
to
be
otherwise
;
and
the
Allens
,
I
am
sure
,
*NL*
are
very
kind
to
you
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
very
kind
;
I
never
was
so
happy
before
;

now
you
are
come
it
*NL*
will
be
more
delightful
than
ever
;
how
good
it
is
of
you
to
come
so
far
*NL*
on
purpose
to
see
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
James
accepted
this
tribute
of
gratitude
,
and
qualified
his
conscience
*NL*
for
accepting
it
too
,
by
saying
with
perfect
sincerity
,
``
Indeed

*NL*
Catherine
,
I
love
you
dearly

Inquiries

,
the
*NL*
situation
of
some
,
the
growth
of
the
rest
,
and
other
family
matters
now
*NL*
passed
between
them

continued
,
with
only
one
small
digression
*NL*
on
James

part

in
praise
of

till
they
reached
Pulteney

Street
,
where
he
was
welcomed
with
great
kindness
by
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Allen
,
*NL*
invited
by
the
former
to
dine
with
them
,
and
summoned
by
the

*NL*
to
guess
the
price

weigh
the

*NL*
A
pre-engagement
in
Edgar
's
Buildings
prevented
his
accepting
the

to
hurry
away
as
soon

had
satisfied

time
of

two
parties

uniting
in

Octagon
Room
being
correctly
adjusted
,
Catherine
was
then
*NL*
left
to
the
luxury
of
a
raised
,
restless
,
and
frightened
imagination
*NL*
over
the
pages
of
Udolpho
,
lost
from
all
worldly
concerns
of
dressing

,
incapable

to
bestow
even

on

reflection

engaged

CHAPTER
8
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
In
spite
of
Udolpho
and
the
dressmaker
,
however
,
the
party
from
Pulteney
*NL*
Street
reached
the
Upper
Rooms
in
very
good
time
.
The
Thorpes
and
James
*NL*
Morland
were
there
only
two
minutes
before
them
;
and
Isabella
having
*NL*
gone
through
the
usual
ceremonial
of
meeting
her
friend
with
the
most
*NL*
smiling
and
affectionate
haste
,
of
admiring
the
set
of
her
gown
,
and
*NL*
envying
the
curl
of
her
hair
,
they
followed
their
chaperones
,
arm
in
*NL*
arm
,
into
the
ballroom
,
whispering
to
each
other
whenever
a
thought
*NL*
occurred
,
and
supplying
the
place
of
many
ideas
by
a
squeeze
of
the
hand
*NL*
or
a
smile
of
affection
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
dancing
began
within
a
few
minutes
after
they
were
seated
;
and
*NL*
James
,
who
had
been
engaged
quite
as
long
as
his
sister
,
was
very
*NL*
importunate
with
Isabella
to
stand
up
;
but
John
was
gone
into
the
*NL*
card-room
to
speak
to
a
friend
,
and
nothing
,
she
declared
,
should
induce
*NL*
her
to
join
the
set
before
her
dear
Catherine
could
join
it
too
.
``
I
*NL*
assure
you
,
''
said
she
,
``
I
would
not
stand
up
without
your
dear
sister
*NL*
for
all
the
world
;
for
if
I
did
we
should
certainly
be
separated
the
*NL*
whole
evening
.
''
Catherine
accepted
this
kindness
with
gratitude
,
and
*NL*
they
continued
as
they
were
for
three
minutes
longer
,
when
Isabella
,
who
*NL*
had
been
talking
to
James
on
the
other
side
of
her
,
turned
again
to
his
*NL*
sister
and
whispered
,
``
My
dear
creature
,
I
am
afraid
I
must
leave
you
,
*NL*
your
brother
is
so
amazingly
impatient
to
begin
;
I
know
you
will
not
*NL*
mind
my
going
away
,
and
I
dare
say
John
will
be
back
in
a
moment
,
*NL*
and
then
you
may
easily
find
me
out
.
''
Catherine
,
though
a
little
*NL*
disappointed
,
had
too
much
good
nature
to
make
any
opposition
,
and
the
*NL*
others
rising
up
,
Isabella
had
only
time
to
press
her
friend
's
hand
and
*NL*
say
,
``
Good-bye
,
my
dear
love
,
''
before
they
hurried
off
.
The
younger
*NL*
Miss
Thorpes
being
also
dancing
,
Catherine
was
left
to
the
mercy
of
Mrs.
*NL*
Thorpe
and
Mrs.
Allen
,
between
whom
she
now
remained
.
She
could
not
help
*NL*
being
vexed
at
the
non-appearance
of
Mr.
Thorpe
,
for
she
not
only
longed
*NL*
to
be
dancing
,
but
was
likewise
aware
that
,
as
the
real
dignity
of
her
*NL*
situation
could
not
be
known
,
she
was
sharing
with
the
scores
of
other
*NL*
young
ladies
still
sitting
down
all
the
discredit
of
wanting
a
partner
.
*NL*
To
be
disgraced
in
the
eye
of
the
world
,
to
wear
the
appearance
of
*NL*
infamy
while
her
heart
is
all
purity
,
her
actions
all
innocence
,
and
the
*NL*
misconduct
of
another
the
true
source
of
her
debasement
,
is
one
of
those
*NL*
circumstances
which
peculiarly
belong
to
the
heroine
's
life
,
and
her
*NL*
fortitude
under
it
what
particularly
dignifies
her
character
.
Catherine
*NL*
had
fortitude
too
;
she
suffered
,
but
no
murmur
passed
her
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
this
state
of
humiliation
,
she
was
roused
,
at
the
end
of
ten
*NL*
minutes
,
to
a
pleasanter
feeling
,
by
seeing
,
not
Mr.
Thorpe
,
but
Mr.
*NL*
Tilney
,
within
three
yards
of
the
place
where
they
sat
;
he
seemed
to
be
*NL*
moving
that
way
,
but
he
did
not
see
her
,
and
therefore
the
smile
and
the
*NL*
blush
,
which
his
sudden
reappearance
raised
in
Catherine
,
passed
away
*NL*
without
sullying
her
heroic
importance
.
He
looked
as
handsome
and
as
*NL*
lively
as
ever
,
and
was
talking
with
interest
to
a
fashionable
and
*NL*
pleasing-looking
young
woman
,
who
leant
on
his
arm
,
and
whom
Catherine
*NL*
immediately
guessed
to
be
his
sister
;
thus
unthinkingly
throwing
away
*NL*
a
fair
opportunity
of
considering
him
lost
to
her
forever
,
by
being
*NL*
married
already
.
But
guided
only
by
what
was
simple
and
probable
,
it
*NL*
had
never
entered
her
head
that
Mr.
Tilney
could
be
married
;
he
had
not
*NL*
behaved
,
he
had
not
talked
,
like
the
married
men
to
whom
she
had
been
*NL*
used
;
he
had
never
mentioned
a
wife
,
and
he
had
acknowledged
a
sister
.
*NL*
From
these
circumstances
sprang
the
instant
conclusion
of
his
sister
's
*NL*
now
being
by
his
side
;
and
therefore
,
instead
of
turning
of
a
deathlike
*NL*
paleness
and
falling
in
a
fit
on
Mrs.
Allen
's
bosom
,
Catherine
sat
*NL*
erect
,
in
the
perfect
use
of
her
senses
,
and
with
cheeks
only
a
little
*NL*
redder
than
usual
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Tilney
and
his
companion
,
who
continued
,
though
slowly
,
to
approach
,
*NL*
were
immediately
preceded
by
a
lady
,
an
acquaintance
of
Mrs.
Thorpe
;
and
*NL*
this
lady
stopping
to
speak
to
her
,
they
,
as
belonging
to
her
,
stopped
*NL*
likewise
,
and
Catherine
,
catching
Mr.
Tilney
's
eye
,
instantly
received
*NL*
from
him
the
smiling
tribute
of
recognition
.
She
returned
it
with
*NL*
pleasure
,
and
then
advancing
still
nearer
,
he
spoke
both
to
her
and
Mrs.
*NL*
Allen
,
by
whom
he
was
very
civilly
acknowledged
.
``
I
am
very
happy
to
see
*NL*
you
again
,
sir
,
indeed
;
I
was
afraid
you
had
left
Bath
.
''
He
thanked
her
*NL*
for
her
fears
,
and
said
that
he
had
quitted
it
for
a
week
,
on
the
very
*NL*
morning
after
his
having
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
sir
,
and
I
dare
say
you
are
not
sorry
to
be
back
again
,
for
it
*NL*
is
just
the
place
for
young
people
--
and
indeed
for
everybody
else
too
.
*NL*
I
tell
Mr.
Allen
,
when
he
talks
of
being
sick
of
it
,
that
I
am
sure
he
*NL*
should
not
complain
,
for
it
is
so
very
agreeable
a
place
,
that
it
is
*NL*
much
better
to
be
here
than
at
home
at
this
dull
time
of
year
.
I
tell
*NL*
him
he
is
quite
in
luck
to
be
sent
here
for
his
health
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
hope
,
madam
,
that
Mr.
Allen
will
be
obliged
to
like
the
place
,
*NL*
from
finding
it
of
service
to
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
sir
.
I
have
no
doubt
that
he
will
.
A
neighbour
of
ours
,
*NL*
Dr.
Skinner
,
was
here
for
his
health
last
winter
,
and
came
away
quite
*NL*
stout
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
circumstance
must
give
great
encouragement
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
--
and
Dr.
Skinner
and
his
family
were
here
three
months
;
so
I
*NL*
tell
Mr.
Allen
he
must
not
be
in
a
hurry
to
get
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
they
were
interrupted
by
a
request
from
Mrs.
Thorpe
to
Mrs.
Allen
,
*NL*
that
she
would
move
a
little
to
accommodate
Mrs.
Hughes
and
Miss
Tilney
*NL*
with
seats
,
as
they
had
agreed
to
join
their
party
.
This
was
accordingly
*NL*
done
,
Mr.
Tilney
still
continuing
standing
before
them
;
and
after
a
*NL*
few
minutes
'
consideration
,
he
asked
Catherine
to
dance
with
him
.
This
*NL*
compliment
,
delightful
as
it
was
,
produced
severe
mortification
to
the
*NL*
lady
;
and
in
giving
her
denial
,
she
expressed
her
sorrow
on
the
occasion
*NL*
so
very
much
as
if
she
really
felt
it
that
had
Thorpe
,
who
joined
her
*NL*
just
afterwards
,
been
half
a
minute
earlier
,
he
might
have
thought
her
*NL*
sufferings
rather
too
acute
.
The
very
easy
manner
in
which
he
then
told
*NL*
her
that
he
had
kept
her
waiting
did
not
by
any
means
reconcile
her
more
*NL*
to
her
lot
;
nor
did
the
particulars
which
he
entered
into
while
they
*NL*
were
standing
up
,
of
the
horses
and
dogs
of
the
friend
whom
he
had
just
*NL*
left
,
and
of
a
proposed
exchange
of
terriers
between
them
,
interest
her
*NL*
so
much
as
to
prevent
her
looking
very
often
towards
that
part
of
the
*NL*
room
where
she
had
left
Mr.
Tilney
.
Of
her
dear
Isabella
,
to
whom
she
*NL*
particularly
longed
to
point
out
that
gentleman
,
she
could
see
nothing
.
*NL*
They
were
in
different
sets
.
She
was
separated
from
all
her
party
,
and
*NL*
away
from
all
her
acquaintance
;
one
mortification
succeeded
another
,
*NL*
and
from
the
whole
she
deduced
this
useful
lesson
,
that
to
go
previously
*NL*
engaged
to
a
ball
does
not
necessarily
increase
either
the
dignity
or
*NL*
enjoyment
of
a
young
lady
.
From
such
a
moralizing
strain
as
this
,
she
*NL*
was
suddenly
roused
by
a
touch
on
the
shoulder
,
and
turning
round
,
*NL*
perceived
Mrs.
Hughes
directly
behind
her
,
attended
by
Miss
Tilney
and
*NL*
a
gentleman
.
``
I
beg
your
pardon
,
Miss
Morland
,
''
said
she
,
``
for
this
*NL*
liberty
--
but
I
can
not
anyhow
get
to
Miss
Thorpe
,
and
Mrs.
Thorpe
said
*NL*
she
was
sure
you
would
not
have
the
least
objection
to
letting
in
this
*NL*
young
lady
by
you
.
''
Mrs.
Hughes
could
not
have
applied
to
any
creature
*NL*
in
the
room
more
happy
to
oblige
her
than
Catherine
.
The
young
ladies
*NL*
were
introduced
to
each
other
,
Miss
Tilney
expressing
a
proper
sense
of
*NL*
such
goodness
,
Miss
Morland
with
the
real
delicacy
of
a
generous
mind
*NL*
making
light
of
the
obligation
;
and
Mrs.
Hughes
,
satisfied
with
having
*NL*
so
respectably
settled
her
young
charge
,
returned
to
her
party
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Tilney
had
a
good
figure
,
a
pretty
face
,
and
a
very
agreeable
*NL*
countenance
;
and
her
air
,
though
it
had
not
all
the
decided
pretension
,
*NL*
the
resolute
stylishness
of
Miss
Thorpe
's
,
had
more
real
elegance
.
Her
*NL*
manners
showed
good
sense
and
good
breeding
;
they
were
neither
shy
nor
*NL*
affectedly
open
;
and
she
seemed
capable
of
being
young
,
attractive
,
and
*NL*
at
a
ball
without
wanting
to
fix
the
attention
of
every
man
near
her
,
*NL*
and
without
exaggerated
feelings
of
ecstatic
delight
or
inconceivable
*NL*
vexation
on
every
little
trifling
occurrence
.
Catherine
,
interested
at
*NL*
once
by
her
appearance
and
her
relationship
to
Mr.
Tilney
,
was
desirous
*NL*
of
being
acquainted
with
her
,
and
readily
talked
therefore
whenever
she
*NL*
could
think
of
anything
to
say
,
and
had
courage
and
leisure
for
saying
*NL*
it
.
But
the
hindrance
thrown
in
the
way
of
a
very
speedy
intimacy
,
by
*NL*
the
frequent
want
of
one
or
more
of
these
requisites
,
prevented
their
*NL*
doing
more
than
going
through
the
first
rudiments
of
an
acquaintance
,
by
*NL*
informing
themselves
how
well
the
other
liked
Bath
,
how
much
she
admired
*NL*
its
buildings
and
surrounding
country
,
whether
she
drew
,
or
played
,
or
*NL*
sang
,
and
whether
she
was
fond
of
riding
on
horseback
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
dances
were
scarcely
concluded
before
Catherine
found
her
arm
*NL*
gently
seized
by
her
faithful
Isabella
,
who
in
great
spirits
exclaimed
,
*NL*
``
At
last
I
have
got
you
.
My
dearest
creature
,
I
have
been
looking
for
*NL*
you
this
hour
.
What
could
induce
you
to
come
into
this
set
,
when
you
*NL*
knew
I
was
in
the
other
?
I
have
been
quite
wretched
without
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Isabella
,
how
was
it
possible
for
me
to
get
at
you
?
I
could
not
*NL*
even
see
where
you
were
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
I
told
your
brother
all
the
time
--
but
he
would
not
believe
me
.
Do
go
*NL*
and
see
for
her
,
Mr.
Morland
,
said
I
--
but
all
in
vain
--
he
would
not
stir
*NL*
an
inch
.
Was
not
it
so
,
Mr.
Morland
?
But
you
men
are
all
so
immoderately
*NL*
lazy
!
I
have
been
scolding
him
to
such
a
degree
,
my
dear
Catherine
,
you
*NL*
would
be
quite
amazed
.
You
know
I
never
stand
upon
ceremony
with
such
*NL*
people
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
at
that
young
lady
with
the
white
beads
round
her
head
,
''
whispered
*NL*
Catherine
,
detaching
her
friend
from
James
.
``
It
is
Mr.
Tilney
's
sister
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
Heavens
!
You
do
n't
say
so
!
Let
me
look
at
her
this
moment
.
What
a
*NL*
delightful
girl
!
I
never
saw
anything
half
so
beautiful
!
But
where
is
*NL*
her
all-conquering
brother
?
Is
he
in
the
room
?
Point
him
out
to
me
this
*NL*
instant
,
if
he
is
.
I
die
to
see
him
.
Mr.
Morland
,
you
are
not
to
listen
.
*NL*
We
are
not
talking
about
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
is
all
this
whispering
about
?
What
is
going
on
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
now
,
I
knew
how
it
would
be
.
You
men
have
such
restless
*NL*
curiosity
!
Talk
of
the
curiosity
of
women
,
indeed
!
'T
is
nothing
.
But
be
*NL*
satisfied
,
for
you
are
not
to
know
anything
at
all
of
the
matter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
is
that
likely
to
satisfy
me
,
do
you
think
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
declare
I
never
knew
anything
like
you
.
What
can
it
signify
to
*NL*
you
,
what
we
are
talking
of
.
Perhaps
we
are
talking
about
you
;
therefore
*NL*
I
would
advise
you
not
to
listen
,
or
you
may
happen
to
hear
something
*NL*
not
very
agreeable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
commonplace
chatter
,
which
lasted
some
time
,
the
original
*NL*
subject
seemed
entirely
forgotten
;
and
though
Catherine
was
very
well
*NL*
pleased
to
have
it
dropped
for
a
while
,
she
could
not
avoid
a
little
*NL*
suspicion
at
the
total
suspension
of
all
Isabella
's
impatient
desire
to
*NL*
see
Mr.
Tilney
.
When
the
orchestra
struck
up
a
fresh
dance
,
James
would
*NL*
have
led
his
fair
partner
away
,
but
she
resisted
.
``
I
tell
you
,
Mr.
*NL*
Morland
,
''
she
cried
,
``
I
would
not
do
such
a
thing
for
all
the
world
.
*NL*
How
can
you
be
so
teasing
;
only
conceive
,
my
dear
Catherine
,
what
your
*NL*
brother
wants
me
to
do
.
He
wants
me
to
dance
with
him
again
,
though
*NL*
I
tell
him
that
it
is
a
most
improper
thing
,
and
entirely
against
the
*NL*
rules
.
It
would
make
us
the
talk
of
the
place
,
if
we
were
not
to
change
*NL*
partners
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Upon
my
honour
,
''
said
James
,
``
in
these
public
assemblies
,
it
is
as
*NL*
often
done
as
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nonsense
,
how
can
you
say
so
?
But
when
you
men
have
a
point
to
carry
,
*NL*
you
never
stick
at
anything
.
My
sweet
Catherine
,
do
support
me
;
persuade
*NL*
your
brother
how
impossible
it
is
.
Tell
him
that
it
would
quite
shock
*NL*
you
to
see
me
do
such
a
thing
;
now
would
not
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
not
at
all
;
but
if
you
think
it
wrong
,
you
had
much
better
change
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
''
cried
Isabella
,
``
you
hear
what
your
sister
says
,
and
yet
you
*NL*
will
not
mind
her
.
Well
,
remember
that
it
is
not
my
fault
,
if
we
set
all
*NL*
the
old
ladies
in
Bath
in
a
bustle
.
Come
along
,
my
dearest
Catherine
,
*NL*
for
heaven
's
sake
,
and
stand
by
me

''
And
off
they
went
,
to
regain
*NL*
their
former
place
.
John
Thorpe
,
in
the
meanwhile
,
had
walked
away
;
and
*NL*
Catherine
,
ever
willing
to
give
Mr.
Tilney
an
opportunity
of
repeating
*NL*
the
agreeable
request
which
had
already
flattered
her
once
,
made
her
*NL*
way
to
Mrs.
Allen
and
Mrs.
Thorpe
as
fast
as
she
could
,
in
the
hope
*NL*
of
finding
him
still
with
them
--
a
hope
which
,
when
it
proved
to
be
*NL*
fruitless
,
she
felt
to
have
been
highly
unreasonable
.
``
Well
,
my
dear
,
''
*NL*
said
Mrs.
Thorpe
,
impatient
for
praise
of
her
son
,
``
I
hope
you
have
had
*NL*
an
agreeable
partner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
agreeable
,
madam
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
glad
of
it
.
John
has
charming
spirits
,
has
not
he
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
meet
Mr.
Tilney
,
my
dear

''
said
Mrs.
Allen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
where
is
he
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
was
with
us
just
now
,
and
said
he
was
so
tired
of
lounging
about
,
*NL*
that
he
was
resolved
to
go
and
dance
;
so
I
thought
perhaps
he
would
ask
*NL*
you
,
if
he
met
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
can
he
be
?
''
said
Catherine
,
looking
round
;
but
she
had
not
looked
*NL*
round
long
before
she
saw
him
leading
a
young
lady
to
the
dance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
He
has
got
a
partner
;
I
wish
he
had
asked
you
,
''
said
Mrs.
Allen
;
*NL*
and
after
a
short
silence
,
she
added
,
``
he
is
a
very
agreeable
young
*NL*
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
he
is
,
Mrs.
Allen
,
''
said
Mrs.
Thorpe
,
smiling
complacently
;
``
I
*NL*
must
say
it
,
though
I
am
his
mother
,
that
there
is
not
a
more
agreeable
*NL*
young
man
in
the
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
inapplicable
answer
might
have
been
too
much
for
the
comprehension
*NL*
of
many
;
but
it
did
not
puzzle
Mrs.
Allen
,
for
after
only
a
moment
's
*NL*
consideration
,
she
said
,
in
a
whisper
to
Catherine
,
``
I
dare
say
she
*NL*
thought
I
was
speaking
of
her
son
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Catherine
was
disappointed
and
vexed
.
She
seemed
to
have
missed
by
so
*NL*
little
the
very
object
she
had
had
in
view
;
and
this
persuasion
did
not
*NL*
incline
her
to
a
very
gracious
reply
,
when
John
Thorpe
came
up
to
her
*NL*
soon
afterwards
and
said
,
``
Well
,
Miss
Morland
,
I
suppose
you
and
I
are
*NL*
to
stand
up
and
jig
it
together
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
;
I
am
much
obliged
to
you
,
our
two
dances
are
over
;
and
,
*NL*
besides
,
I
am
tired
,
and
do
not
mean
to
dance
any
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
not
you
?
Then
let
us
walk
about
and
quiz
people
.
Come
along
with
*NL*
me
,
and
I
will
show
you
the
four
greatest
quizzers
in
the
room
;
my
two
*NL*
younger
sisters
and
their
partners
.
I
have
been
laughing
at
them
this
*NL*
half
hour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
Catherine
excused
herself
;
and
at
last
he
walked
off
to
quiz
his
*NL*
sisters
by
himself
.
The
rest
of
the
evening
she
found
very
dull
;
Mr.
*NL*
Tilney
was
drawn
away
from
their
party
at
tea
,
to
attend
that
of
his
*NL*
partner
;
Miss
Tilney
,
though
belonging
to
it
,
did
not
sit
near
her
,
and
*NL*
James
and
Isabella
were
so
much
engaged
in
conversing
together
that
the
*NL*
latter
had
no
leisure
to
bestow
more
on
her
friend
than
one
smile
,
one
*NL*
squeeze
,
and
one
``
dearest

CHAPTER
9
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
progress
of
Catherine
's
unhappiness
from
the
events
of
the
evening
*NL*
was
as
follows
.
It
appeared
first
in
a
general
dissatisfaction
with
*NL*
everybody
about
her
,
while
she
remained
in
the
rooms
,
which
speedily
*NL*
brought
on
considerable
weariness
and
a
violent
desire
to
go
home
.
This
,
*NL*
on
arriving
in
Pulteney
Street
,
took
the
direction
of
extraordinary
*NL*
hunger
,
and
when
that
was
appeased
,
changed
into
an
earnest
longing
to
*NL*
be
in
bed
;
such
was
the
extreme
point
of
her
distress
;
for
when
there
*NL*
she
immediately
fell
into
a
sound
sleep
which
lasted
nine
hours
,
and
*NL*
from
which
she
awoke
perfectly
revived
,
in
excellent
spirits
,
with
fresh
*NL*
hopes
and
fresh
schemes
.
The
first
wish
of
her
heart
was
to
improve
her
*NL*
acquaintance
with
Miss
Tilney
,
and
almost
her
first
resolution
,
to
seek
*NL*
her
for
that
purpose
,
in
the
pump-room
at
noon
.
In
the
pump-room
,
one
*NL*
so
newly
arrived
in
Bath
must
be
met
with
,
and
that
building
she
had
*NL*
already
found
so
favourable
for
the
discovery
of
female
excellence
,
*NL*
and
the
completion
of
female
intimacy
,
so
admirably
adapted
for
secret
*NL*
discourses
and
unlimited
confidence
,
that
she
was
most
reasonably
*NL*
encouraged
to
expect
another
friend
from
within
its
walls
.
Her
plan
*NL*
for
the
morning
thus
settled
,
she
sat
quietly
down
to
her
book
after
*NL*
breakfast
,
resolving
to
remain
in
the
same
place
and
the
same
employment
*NL*
till
the
clock
struck
one
;
and
from
habitude
very
little
incommoded
by
*NL*
the
remarks
and
ejaculations
of
Mrs.
Allen
,
whose
vacancy
of
mind
and
*NL*
incapacity
for
thinking
were
such
,
that
as
she
never
talked
a
great
*NL*
deal
,
so
she
could
never
be
entirely
silent
;
and
,
therefore
,
while
she
*NL*
sat
at
her
work
,
if
she
lost
her
needle
or
broke
her
thread
,
if
she
*NL*
heard
a
carriage
in
the
street
,
or
saw
a
speck
upon
her
gown
,
she
must
*NL*
observe
it
aloud
,
whether
there
were
anyone
at
leisure
to
answer
her
or
*NL*
not
.
At
about
half
past
twelve
,
a
remarkably
loud
rap
drew
her
in
haste
*NL*
to
the
window
,
and
scarcely
had
she
time
to
inform
Catherine
of
there
*NL*
being
two
open
carriages
at
the
door
,
in
the
first
only
a
servant
,
*NL*
her
brother
driving
Miss
Thorpe
in
the
second
,
before
John
Thorpe
came
*NL*
running
upstairs
,
calling
out
,
``
Well
,
Miss
Morland
,
here
I
am
.
Have
*NL*
you
been
waiting
long
?
We
could
not
come
before
;
the
old
devil
of
a
*NL*
coachmaker
was
such
an
eternity
finding
out
a
thing
fit
to
be
got
into
,
*NL*
and
now
it
is
ten
thousand
to
one
but
they
break
down
before
we
are
out
*NL*
of
the
street
.
How
do
you
do
,
Mrs.
Allen
?
A
famous
ball
last
night
,
was
*NL*
not
it
?
Come
,
Miss
Morland
,
be
quick
,
for
the
others
are
in
a
confounded
*NL*
hurry
to
be
off
.
They
want
to
get
their
tumble
over
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
?
''
said
Catherine
.
``
Where
are
you
all

``
Going
to

Why
,
you
have
not
forgot
our
engagement

Did
not
we
agree

together
to
take
a
drive
this
morning

What

We

Down

Catherine
,
looking
at

Mrs.

for
her
opinion
;

really
I
did

*NL*
*NL*
``
Not

That

a

one

And

you

have
made

if

come

''
*NL*
*NL*
Catherine
's
silent
appeal
to
her
friend
,
meanwhile
,
was
entirely
thrown
*NL*
away
,
for
Mrs.
Allen
,
not
being
at
all
in
the
habit
of
conveying
any
*NL*
expression
herself
by
a
look
,
was
not
aware
of
its
being
ever
intended
*NL*
by
anybody
else
;
and
Catherine
,
whose
desire
of
seeing
Miss
Tilney
again
*NL*
could
at
that
moment
bear
a
short
delay
in
favour
of
a
drive
,
and
who
*NL*
thought
there
could
be
no
impropriety
in
her
going
with
Mr.
Thorpe
,
as
*NL*
Isabella
was
going
at
the
same
time
with
James
,
was
therefore
obliged
to
*NL*
speak
plainer
.
``
Well
,
ma'am
,
what
do
you
say
to
it
?
Can
you
spare
me
for
*NL*
an
hour
or
two
?
Shall
I
go
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
just
as
you
please
,
my
dear
,
''
replied
Mrs.
Allen
,
with
the
most
*NL*
placid
indifference
.
Catherine
took
the
advice
,
and
ran
off
to
get
*NL*
ready
.
In
a
very
few
minutes
she
reappeared
,
having
scarcely
allowed
*NL*
the
two
others
time
enough
to
get
through
a
few
short
sentences
in
her
*NL*
praise
,
after
Thorpe
had
procured
Mrs.
Allen
's
admiration
of
his
gig
;
*NL*
and
then
receiving
her
friend
's
parting
good
wishes
,
they
both
hurried
*NL*
downstairs
.
``
My
dearest
creature
,
''
cried
Isabella
,
to
whom
the
duty
*NL*
of
friendship
immediately
called
her
before
she
could
get
into
the
*NL*
carriage
,
``
you
have
been
at
least
three
hours
getting
ready
.
I
was
*NL*
afraid
you
were
ill
.
What
a
delightful
ball
we
had
last
night
.
I
have
a
*NL*
thousand
things
to
say
to
you
;
but
make
haste
and
get
in
,
for
I
long
to
*NL*
be
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Catherine
followed
her
orders
and
turned
away
,
but
not
too
soon
to
hear
*NL*
her
friend
exclaim
aloud
to
James
,
``
What
a
sweet
girl
she
is
!
I
quite
*NL*
dote
on
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
not
be
frightened
,
Miss
Morland
,
''
said
Thorpe
,
as
he
handed
*NL*
her
in
,
``
if
my
horse
should
dance
about
a
little
at
first
setting
off
.
*NL*
He
will
,
most
likely
,
give
a
plunge
or
two
,
and
perhaps
take
the
rest
*NL*
for
a
minute
;
but
he
will
soon
know
his
master
.
He
is
full
of
spirits
,
*NL*
playful
as
can
be
,
but
there
is
no
vice
in
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Catherine
did
not
think
the
portrait
a
very
inviting
one
,
but
it
was
too
*NL*
late
to
retreat
,
and
she
was
too
young
to
own
herself
frightened
;
so
,
*NL*
resigning
herself
to
her
fate
,
and
trusting
to
the
animal
's
boasted
*NL*
knowledge
of
its
owner
,
she
sat
peaceably
down
,
and
saw
Thorpe
sit
down
*NL*
by
her
.
Everything
being
then
arranged
,
the
servant
who
stood
at
the
*NL*
horse
's
head
was
bid
in
an
important
voice
``
to
let
him
go
,
''
and
off
they
*NL*
went
in
the
quietest
manner
imaginable
,
without
a
plunge
or
a
caper
,
or
*NL*
anything
like
one
.
Catherine
,
delighted
at
so
happy
an
escape
,
spoke
*NL*
her
pleasure
aloud
with
grateful
surprise
;
and
her
companion
immediately
*NL*
made
the
matter
perfectly
simple
by
assuring
her
that
it
was
entirely
*NL*
owing
to
the
peculiarly
judicious
manner
in
which
he
had
then
held
the
*NL*
reins
,
and
the
singular
discernment
and
dexterity
with
which
he
had
*NL*
directed
his
whip
.
Catherine
,
though
she
could
not
help
wondering
that
*NL*
with
such
perfect
command
of
his
horse
,
he
should
think
it
necessary
to
*NL*
alarm
her
with
a
relation
of
its
tricks
,
congratulated
herself
sincerely
*NL*
on
being
under
the
care
of
so
excellent
a
coachman
;
and
perceiving
that
*NL*
the
animal
continued
to
go
on
in
the
same
quiet
manner
,
without
*NL*
showing
the
smallest
propensity
towards
any
unpleasant
vivacity
,
and
*NL*
-LRB-
considering
its
inevitable
pace
was
ten
miles
an
hour
-RRB-
by
no
means
*NL*
alarmingly
fast
,
gave
herself
up
to
all
the
enjoyment
of
air
and
*NL*
exercise
of
the
most
invigorating
kind
,
in
a
fine
mild
day
of
February
,
*NL*
with
the
consciousness
of
safety
.
A
silence
of
several
minutes
succeeded
*NL*
their
first
short
dialogue
;
it
was
broken
by
Thorpe
's
saying
very
*NL*
abruptly
,
``
Old
Allen
is
as
rich
as
a
Jew
--
is
not
he
?
''
Catherine
did
not
*NL*
understand
him
--
and
he
repeated
his
question
,
adding
in
explanation
,
*NL*
``
Old
Allen
,
the
man
you
are
with
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
Mr.
Allen
,
you
mean
.
Yes
,
I
believe
,
he
is
very
rich
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
no
children
at
all
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
not
any
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
famous
thing
for
his
next
heirs
.
He
is
your
godfather
,
is
not
he
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
godfather
!
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
are
always
very
much
with
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
very
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
,
that
is
what
I
meant
.
He
seems
a
good
kind
of
old
fellow
enough
,
*NL*
and
has
lived
very
well
in
his
time
,
I
dare
say
;
he
is
not
gouty
for
*NL*
nothing
.
Does
he
drink
his
bottle
a
day
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
His
bottle
a
day
!
No
.
Why
should
you
think
of
such
a
thing
?
He
is
a
*NL*
very
temperate
man
,
and
you
could
not
fancy
him
in
liquor
last
night
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lord
help
you
!
You
women
are
always
thinking
of
men
's
being
in
liquor
.
*NL*
Why
,
you
do
not
suppose
a
man
is
overset
by
a
bottle
?
I
am
sure
of
*NL*
this
--
that
if
everybody
was
to
drink
their
bottle
a
day
,
there
would
not
*NL*
be
half
the
disorders
in
the
world
there
are
now
.
It
would
be
a
famous
*NL*
good
thing
for
us
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
believe
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
Lord
,
it
would
be
the
saving
of
thousands
.
There
is
not
the
*NL*
hundredth
part
of
the
wine
consumed
in
this
kingdom
that
there
ought
to
*NL*
be
.
Our
foggy
climate
wants
help
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
yet
I
have
heard
that
there
is
a
great
deal
of
wine
drunk
in
*NL*
Oxford
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oxford
!
There
is
no
drinking
at
Oxford
now
,
I
assure
you
.
Nobody
drinks
*NL*
there
.
You
would
hardly
meet
with
a
man
who
goes
beyond
his
four
pints
*NL*
at
the
utmost
.
Now
,
for
instance
,
it
was
reckoned
a
remarkable
thing
,
at
*NL*
the
last
party
in
my
rooms
,
that
upon
an
average
we
cleared
about
five
*NL*
pints
a
head
.
It
was
looked
upon
as
something
out
of
the
common
way
.
*NL*
Mine
is
famous
good
stuff
,
to
be
sure
.
You
would
not
often
meet
with
*NL*
anything
like
it
in
Oxford
--
and
that
may
account
for
it
.
But
this
will
*NL*
just
give
you
a
notion
of
the
general
rate
of
drinking
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
does
give
a
notion
,
''
said
Catherine
warmly
,
``
and
that
is
,
that
*NL*
you
all
drink
a
great
deal
more
wine
than
I
thought
you
did
.
However
,
I
*NL*
am
sure
James
does
not
drink
so
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
declaration
brought
on
a
loud
and
overpowering
reply
,
of
which
*NL*
no
part
was
very
distinct
,
except
the
frequent
exclamations
,
amounting
*NL*
almost
to
oaths
,
which
adorned
it
,
and
Catherine
was
left
,
when
it
*NL*
ended
,
with
rather
a
strengthened
belief
of
there
being
a
great
deal
*NL*
of
wine
drunk
in
Oxford
,
and
the
same
happy
conviction
of
her
brother
's
*NL*
comparative
sobriety
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thorpe
's
ideas
then
all
reverted
to
the
merits
of
his
own
equipage
,
and
*NL*
she
was
called
on
to
admire
the
spirit
and
freedom
with
which
his
horse
*NL*
moved
along
,
and
the
ease
which
his
paces
,
as
well
as
the
excellence
of
*NL*
the
springs
,
gave
the
motion
of
the
carriage
.
She
followed
him
in
all
*NL*
his
admiration
as
well
as
she
could
.
To
go
before
or
beyond
him
was
*NL*
impossible
.
His
knowledge
and
her
ignorance
of
the
subject
,
his
rapidity
*NL*
of
expression
,
and
her
diffidence
of
herself
put
that
out
of
her
power
;
*NL*
she
could
strike
out
nothing
new
in
commendation
,
but
she
readily
echoed
*NL*
whatever
he
chose
to
assert
,
and
it
was
finally
settled
between
them
*NL*
without
any
difficulty
that
his
equipage
was
altogether
the
most
*NL*
complete
of
its
kind
in
England
,
his
carriage
the
neatest
,
his
horse
the
*NL*
best
goer
,
and
himself
the
best
coachman
.
``
You
do
not
really
think
,
*NL*
Mr.
Thorpe
,
''
said
Catherine
,
venturing
after
some
time
to
consider
the
*NL*
matter
as
entirely
decided
,
and
to
offer
some
little
variation
on
the
*NL*
subject
,
``
that
James
's
gig
will
break
down
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Break
down
!
Oh
!
Lord
!
Did
you
ever
see
such
a
little
tittuppy
thing
in
*NL*
your
life
?
There
is
not
a
sound
piece
of
iron
about
it
.
The
wheels
have
*NL*
been
fairly
worn
out
these
ten
years
at
least
--
and
as
for
the
body
!
Upon
*NL*
my
soul
,
you
might
shake
it
to
pieces
yourself
with
a
touch
.
It
is
the
*NL*
most
devilish
little
rickety
business
I
ever
beheld
!
Thank
God
!
we
*NL*
have
got
a
better
.
I
would
not
be
bound
to
go
two
miles
in
it
for
fifty
*NL*
thousand
pounds
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
heavens
!
''
cried
Catherine
,
quite
frightened
.
``
Then
pray
let
us
*NL*
turn
back
;
they
will
certainly
meet
with
an
accident
if
we
go
on
.
Do
let
*NL*
us
turn
back
,
Mr.
Thorpe
;
stop
and
speak
to
my
brother
,
and
tell
him
how
*NL*
very
unsafe
it
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Unsafe
!
Oh
,
lord
!
What
is
there
in
that
?
They
will
only
get
a
roll
if
*NL*
it
does
break
down
;
and
there
is
plenty
of
dirt
;
it
will
be
excellent
*NL*
falling
.
Oh
,
curse
it
!
The
carriage
is
safe
enough
,
if
a
man
knows
how
*NL*
to
drive
it
;
a
thing
of
that
sort
in
good
hands
will
last
above
twenty
*NL*
years
after
it
is
fairly
worn
out
.
Lord
bless
you
!
I
would
undertake
for
*NL*
five
pounds
to
drive
it
to
York
and
back
again
,
without
losing
a
nail
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Catherine
listened
with
astonishment
;
she
knew
not
how
to
reconcile
two
*NL*
such
very
different
accounts
of
the
same
thing
;
for
she
had
not
been
*NL*
brought
up
to
understand
the
propensities
of
a
rattle
,
nor
to
know
to
*NL*
how
many
idle
assertions
and
impudent
falsehoods
the
excess
of
vanity
*NL*
will
lead
.
Her
own
family
were
plain
,
matter-of-fact
people
who
seldom
*NL*
aimed
at
wit
of
any
kind
;
her
father
,
at
the
utmost
,
being
contented
*NL*
with
a
pun
,
and
her
mother
with
a
proverb
;
they
were
not
in
the
habit
*NL*
therefore
of
telling
lies
to
increase
their
importance
,
or
of
asserting
*NL*
at
one
moment
what
they
would
contradict
the
next
.
She
reflected
on
the
*NL*
affair
for
some
time
in
much
perplexity
,
and
was
more
than
once
on
the
*NL*
point
of
requesting
from
Mr.
Thorpe
a
clearer
insight
into
his
real
*NL*
opinion
on
the
subject
;
but
she
checked
herself
,
because
it
appeared
to
*NL*
her
that
he
did
not
excel
in
giving
those
clearer
insights
,
in
making
*NL*
those
things
plain
which
he
had
before
made
ambiguous
;
and
,
joining
to
*NL*
this
,
the
consideration
that
he
would
not
really
suffer
his
sister
and
*NL*
his
friend
to
be
exposed
to
a
danger
from
which
he
might
easily
preserve
*NL*
them
,
she
concluded
at
last
that
he
must
know
the
carriage
to
be
in
fact
*NL*
perfectly
safe
,
and
therefore
would
alarm
herself
no
longer
.
By
him
*NL*
the
whole
matter
seemed
entirely
forgotten
;
and
all
the
rest
of
his
*NL*
conversation
,
or
rather
talk
,
began
and
ended
with
himself
and
his
own
*NL*
concerns
.
He
told
her
of
horses
which
he
had
bought
for
a
trifle
and
*NL*
sold
for
incredible
sums
;
of
racing
matches
,
in
which
his
judgment
had
*NL*
infallibly
foretold
the
winner
;
of
shooting
parties
,
in
which
he
had
*NL*
killed
more
birds
-LRB-
though
without
having
one
good
shot
-RRB-
than
all
his
*NL*
companions
together
;
and
described
to
her
some
famous
day
's
sport
,
with
*NL*
the
fox-hounds
,
in
which
his
foresight
and
skill
in
directing
the
dogs
*NL*
had
repaired
the
mistakes
of
the
most
experienced
huntsman
,
and
in
which
*NL*
the
boldness
of
his
riding
,
though
it
had
never
endangered
his
own
life
*NL*
for
a
moment
,
had
been
constantly
leading
others
into
difficulties
,
*NL*
which
he
calmly
concluded
had
broken
the
necks
of
many
.
*NL*
*NL*
Little
as
Catherine
was
in
the
habit
of
judging
for
herself
,
and
unfixed
*NL*
as
were
her
general
notions
of
what
men
ought
to
be
,
she
could
not
*NL*
entirely
repress
a
doubt
,
while
she
bore
with
the
effusions
of
his
*NL*
endless
conceit
,
of
his
being
altogether
completely
agreeable
.
It
was
a
*NL*
bold
surmise
,
for
he
was
Isabella
's
brother
;
and
she
had
been
assured
by
*NL*
James
that
his
manners
would
recommend
him
to
all
her
sex
;
but
in
spite
*NL*
of
this
,
the
extreme
weariness
of
his
company
,
which
crept
over
her
*NL*
before
they
had
been
out
an
hour
,
and
which
continued
unceasingly
to
*NL*
increase
till
they
stopped
in
Pulteney
Street
again
,
induced
her
,
in
*NL*
some
small
degree
,
to
resist
such
high
authority
,
and
to
distrust
his
*NL*
powers
of
giving
universal
pleasure
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
arrived
at
Mrs.
Allen
's
door
,
the
astonishment
of
Isabella
was
*NL*
hardly
to
be
expressed
,
on
finding
that
it
was
too
late
in
the
day
for
*NL*
them
to
attend
her
friend
into
the
house
:
``
Past
three
o'clock
!
''
It
was
*NL*
inconceivable
,
incredible
,
impossible
!
And
she
would
neither
believe
her
*NL*
own
watch
,
nor
her
brother
's
,
nor
the
servant
's
;
she
would
believe
no
*NL*
assurance
of
it
founded
on
reason
or
reality
,
till
Morland
produced
his
*NL*
watch
,
and
ascertained
the
fact
;
to
have
doubted
a
moment
longer
then
*NL*
would
have
been
equally
inconceivable
,
incredible
,
and
impossible
;
and
*NL*
she
could
only
protest
,
over
and
over
again
,
that
no
two
hours
and
a
*NL*
half
had
ever
gone
off
so
swiftly
before
,
as
Catherine
was
called
on
to
*NL*
confirm
;
Catherine
could
not
tell
a
falsehood
even
to
please
Isabella
;
*NL*
but
the
latter
was
spared
the
misery
of
her
friend
's
dissenting
voice
,
*NL*
by
not
waiting
for
her
answer
.
Her
own
feelings
entirely
engrossed
*NL*
her
;
her
wretchedness
was
most
acute
on
finding
herself
obliged
to
go
*NL*
directly
home
.
It
was
ages
since
she
had
had
a
moment
's
conversation
*NL*
with
her
dearest
Catherine
;
and
,
though
she
had
such
thousands
of
things
*NL*
to
say
to
her
,
it
appeared
as
if
they
were
never
to
be
together
again
;
*NL*
so
,
with
smiles
of
most
exquisite
misery
,
and
the
laughing
eye
of
utter
*NL*
despondency
,
she
bade
her
friend
adieu
and
went
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
Catherine
found
Mrs.
Allen
just
returned
from
all
the
busy
idleness
of
*NL*
the
morning
,
and
was
immediately
greeted
with
,
``
Well
,
my
dear
,
here
*NL*
you
are
,
''
a
truth
which
she
had
no
greater
inclination
than
power
to
*NL*
dispute
;
``
and
I
hope
you
have
had
a
pleasant
airing
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
ma'am
,
I
thank
you
;
we
could
not
have
had
a
nicer
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
Mrs.
Thorpe
said
;
she
was
vastly
pleased
at
your
all
going
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
seen
Mrs.
Thorpe
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
went
to
the
pump-room
as
soon
as
you
were
gone
,
and
there
I
met
*NL*
her
,
and
we
had
a
great
deal
of
talk
together
.
She
says
there
was
hardly
*NL*
any
veal
to
be
got
at
market
this
morning
,
it
is
so
uncommonly
scarce
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
see
anybody
else
of
our
acquaintance
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
we
agreed
to
take
a
turn
in
the
Crescent
,
and
there
we
met
Mrs.
*NL*
Hughes
,
and
Mr.
and
Miss
Tilney
walking
with
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
indeed
?
And
did
they
speak
to
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
we
walked
along
the
Crescent
together
for
half
an
hour
.
They
seem
*NL*
very
agreeable
people
.
Miss
Tilney
was
in
a
very
pretty
spotted
*NL*
muslin
,
and
I
fancy
,
by
what
I
can
learn
,
that
she
always
dresses
very
*NL*
handsomely
.
Mrs.
Hughes
talked
to
me
a
great
deal
about
the
family
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
did
she
tell
you
of
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
A
vast
deal
indeed
;
she
hardly
talked
of
anything
else
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
she
tell
you
what
part
of
Gloucestershire
they
come
from
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
she
did
;
but
I
can
not
recollect
now
.
But
they
are
very
good
kind
*NL*
of
people
,
and
very
rich
.
Mrs.
Tilney
was
a
Miss
Drummond
,
and
she
*NL*
and
Mrs.
Hughes
were
schoolfellows
;
and
Miss
Drummond
had
a
very
large
*NL*
fortune
;
and
,
when
she
married
,
her
father
gave
her
twenty
thousand
*NL*
pounds
,
and
five
hundred
to
buy
wedding-clothes
.
Mrs.
Hughes
saw
all
the
*NL*
clothes
after
they
came
from
the
warehouse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
are
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Tilney
in
Bath
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
fancy
they
are
,
but
I
am
not
quite
certain
.
Upon
recollection
,
*NL*
however
,
I
have
a
notion
they
are
both
dead
;
at
least
the
mother
is
;
*NL*
yes
,
I
am
sure
Mrs.
Tilney
is
dead
,
because
Mrs.
Hughes
told
me
there
*NL*
was
a
very
beautiful
set
of
pearls
that
Mr.
Drummond
gave
his
daughter
*NL*
on
her
wedding-day
and
that
Miss
Tilney
has
got
now
,
for
they
were
put
*NL*
by
for
her
when
her
mother
died
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
is
Mr.
Tilney
,
my
partner
,
the
only
son
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
be
quite
positive
about
that
,
my
dear
;
I
have
some
idea
he
is
;
*NL*
but
,
however
,
he
is
a
very
fine
young
man
,
Mrs.
Hughes
says
,
and
likely
*NL*
to
do
very
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Catherine
inquired
no
further
;
she
had
heard
enough
to
feel
that
*NL*
Mrs.
Allen
had
no
real
intelligence
to
give
,
and
that
she
was
most
*NL*
particularly
unfortunate
herself
in
having
missed
such
a
meeting
with
*NL*
both
brother
and
sister
.
Could
she
have
foreseen
such
a
circumstance
,
*NL*
nothing
should
have
persuaded
her
to
go
out
with
the
others
;
and
,
as
*NL*
it
was
,
she
could
only
lament
her
ill
luck
,
and
think
over
what
she
had
*NL*
lost
,
till
it
was
clear
to
her
that
the
drive
had
by
no
means
been
very
*NL*
pleasant
and
that
John
Thorpe
himself
was
quite
disagreeable
.

CHAPTER
10
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
Allens
,
Thorpes
,
and
Morlands
all
met
in
the
evening
at
the
*NL*
theatre
;
and
,
as
Catherine
and
Isabella
sat
together
,
there
was
then
an
*NL*
opportunity
for
the
latter
to
utter
some
few
of
the
many
thousand
*NL*
things
which
had
been
collecting
within
her
for
communication
in
the
*NL*
immeasurable
length
of
time
which
had
divided
them
.
``
Oh
,
heavens
!
*NL*
My
beloved
Catherine
,
have
I
got
you
at
last
?
''
was
her
address
on
*NL*
Catherine
's
entering
the
box
and
sitting
by
her
.
``
Now
,
Mr.
Morland
,
''
for
*NL*
he
was
close
to
her
on
the
other
side
,
``
I
shall
not
speak
another
word
*NL*
to
you
all
the
rest
of
the
evening
;
so
I
charge
you
not
to
expect
it
.
My
*NL*
sweetest
Catherine
,
how
have
you
been
this
long
age
?
But
I
need
not
ask
*NL*
you
,
for
you
look
delightfully
.
You
really
have
done
your
hair
in
a
*NL*
more
heavenly
style
than
ever
;
you
mischievous
creature
,
do
you
want
to
*NL*
attract
everybody
?
I
assure
you
,
my
brother
is
quite
in
love
with
you
*NL*
already
;
and
as
for
Mr.
Tilney
--
but
that
is
a
settled
thing
--
even
your
*NL*
modesty
can
not
doubt
his
attachment
now
;
his
coming
back
to
Bath
makes
*NL*
it
too
plain
.
Oh
!
What
would
not
I
give
to
see
him
!
I
really
am
quite
*NL*
wild
with
impatience
.
My
mother
says
he
is
the
most
delightful
young
man
*NL*
in
the
world
;
she
saw
him
this
morning
,
you
know
;
you
must
introduce
him
*NL*
to
me
.
Is
he
in
the
house
now
?
Look
about
,
for
heaven
's
sake
!
I
assure
*NL*
you
,
I
can
hardly
exist
till
I
see
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Catherine
,
``
he
is
not
here
;
I
can
not
see
him
anywhere
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
horrid
!
Am
I
never
to
be
acquainted
with
him
?
How
do
you
like
my
*NL*
gown
?
I
think
it
does
not
look
amiss
;
the
sleeves
were
entirely
my
own
*NL*
thought
.
Do
you
know
,
I
get
so
immoderately
sick
of
Bath
;
your
brother
*NL*
and
I
were
agreeing
this
morning
that
,
though
it
is
vastly
well
to
be
*NL*
here
for
a
few
weeks
,
we
would
not
live
here
for
millions
.
We
soon
found
*NL*
out
that
our
tastes
were
exactly
alike
in
preferring
the
country
to
*NL*
every
other
place
;
really
,
our
opinions
were
so
exactly
the
same
,
it
was
*NL*
quite
ridiculous
!
There
was
not
a
single
point
in
which
we
differed
;
I
*NL*
would
not
have
had
you
by
for
the
world
;
you
are
such
a
sly
thing
,
I
am
*NL*
sure
you
would
have
made
some
droll
remark
or
other
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
indeed
I
should
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
you
would
indeed
;
I
know
you
better
than
you
know
yourself
.
You
*NL*
would
have
told
us
that
we
seemed
born
for
each
other
,
or
some
nonsense
*NL*
of
that
kind
,
which
would
have
distressed
me
beyond
conception
;
my
*NL*
cheeks
would
have
been
as
red
as
your
roses
;
I
would
not
have
had
you
by
*NL*
for
the
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
you
do
me
injustice
;
I
would
not
have
made
so
improper
a
remark
*NL*
upon
any
account
;
and
besides
,
I
am
sure
it
would
never
have
entered
my
*NL*
head
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabella
smiled
incredulously
and
talked
the
rest
of
the
evening
to
*NL*
James
.
*NL*
*NL*
Catherine
's
resolution
of
endeavouring
to
meet
Miss
Tilney
again
*NL*
continued
in
full
force
the
next
morning
;
and
till
the
usual
moment
of
*NL*
going
to
the
pump-room
,
she
felt
some
alarm
from
the
dread
of
a
second
*NL*
prevention
.
But
nothing
of
that
kind
occurred
,
no
visitors
appeared
to
*NL*
delay
them
,
and
they
all
three
set
off
in
good
time
for
the
pump-room
,
*NL*
where
the
ordinary
course
of
events
and
conversation
took
place
;
Mr.
*NL*
Allen
,
after
drinking
his
glass
of
water
,
joined
some
gentlemen
to
*NL*
talk
over
the
politics
of
the
day
and
compare
the
accounts
of
their
*NL*
newspapers
;
and
the
ladies
walked
about
together
,
noticing
every
new
*NL*
face
,
and
almost
every
new
bonnet
in
the
room
.
The
female
part
of
the
*NL*
Thorpe
family
,
attended
by
James
Morland
,
appeared
among
the
crowd
in
*NL*
less
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
and
Catherine
immediately
took
her
*NL*
usual
place
by
the
side
of
her
friend
.
James
,
who
was
now
in
constant
*NL*
attendance
,
maintained
a
similar
position
,
and
separating
themselves
*NL*
from
the
rest
of
their
party
,
they
walked
in
that
manner
for
some
*NL*
time
,
till
Catherine
began
to
doubt
the
happiness
of
a
situation
which
,
*NL*
confining
her
entirely
to
her
friend
and
brother
,
gave
her
very
*NL*
little
share
in
the
notice
of
either
.
They
were
always
engaged
in
*NL*
some
sentimental
discussion
or
lively
dispute
,
but
their
sentiment
was
*NL*
conveyed
in
such
whispering
voices
,
and
their
vivacity
attended
with
*NL*
so
much
laughter
,
that
though
Catherine
's
supporting
opinion
was
not
*NL*
unfrequently
called
for
by
one
or
the
other
,
she
was
never
able
to
give
*NL*
any
,
from
not
having
heard
a
word
of
the
subject
.
At
length
however
*NL*
she
was
empowered
to
disengage
herself
from
her
friend
,
by
the
avowed
*NL*
necessity
of
speaking
to
Miss
Tilney
,
whom
she
most
joyfully
saw
just
*NL*
entering
the
room
with
Mrs.
Hughes
,
and
whom
she
instantly
joined
,
with
*NL*
a
firmer
determination
to
be
acquainted
,
than
she
might
have
had
courage
*NL*
to
command
,
had
she
not
been
urged
by
the
disappointment
of
the
day
*NL*
before
.
Miss
Tilney
met
her
with
great
civility
,
returned
her
advances
*NL*
with
equal
goodwill
,
and
they
continued
talking
together
as
long
as
*NL*
both
parties
remained
in
the
room
;
and
though
in
all
probability
not
*NL*
an
observation
was
made
,
nor
an
expression
used
by
either
which
had
not
*NL*
been
made
and
used
some
thousands
of
times
before
,
under
that
roof
,
in
*NL*
every
Bath
season
,
yet
the
merit
of
their
being
spoken
with
simplicity
*NL*
and
truth
,
and
without
personal
conceit
,
might
be
something
uncommon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
well
your
brother
dances
!
''
was
an
artless
exclamation
of
*NL*
Catherine
's
towards
the
close
of
their
conversation
,
which
at
once
*NL*
surprised
and
amused
her
companion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Henry
!
''
she
replied
with
a
smile
.
``
Yes
,
he
does
dance
very
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
must
have
thought
it
very
odd
to
hear
me
say
I
was
engaged
the
other
*NL*
evening
,
when
he
saw
me
sitting
down
.
But
I
really
had
been
engaged
*NL*
the
whole
day
to
Mr.
Thorpe
.
''
Miss
Tilney
could
only
bow
.
``
You
can
not
*NL*
think
,
''
added
Catherine
after
a
moment
's
silence
,
``
how
surprised
I
was
*NL*
to
see
him
again
.
I
felt
so
sure
of
his
being
quite
gone
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
Henry
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
before
,
he
was
in
Bath
but
*NL*
for
a
couple
of
days
.
He
came
only
to
engage
lodgings
for
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
never
occurred
to
me
;
and
of
course
,
not
seeing
him
anywhere
,
I
*NL*
thought
he
must
be
gone
.
Was
not
the
young
lady
he
danced
with
on
Monday
*NL*
a
Miss
Smith
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
an
acquaintance
of
Mrs.
Hughes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
dare
say
she
was
very
glad
to
dance
.
Do
you
think
her
pretty
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
very
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
never
comes
to
the
pump-room
,
I
suppose
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sometimes

but
he
has
rid
out
this
morning
with
my
father

*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Hughes
now
joined
them
,
and
asked
Miss
Tilney
if
she
was
ready
to
*NL*
go
.
``
I
hope
I
shall
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
again
soon
,
''
said
*NL*
Catherine
.
``
Shall
you
be
at
the
cotillion
ball
tomorrow
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
we
--
Yes
,
I
think
we
certainly
shall
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
glad
of
it
,
for
we
shall
all
be
there
.
''
This
civility
was
duly
*NL*
returned
;
and
they
parted
--
on
Miss
Tilney
's
side
with
some
knowledge
*NL*
of
her
new
acquaintance
's
feelings
,
and
on
Catherine
's
,
without
the
*NL*
smallest
consciousness
of
having
explained
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
went
home
very
happy
.
The
morning
had
answered
all
her
hopes
,
and
*NL*
the
evening
of
the
following
day
was
now
the
object
of
expectation
,
*NL*
the
future
good
.
What
gown
and
what
head-dress
she
should
wear
on
the
*NL*
occasion
became
her
chief
concern
.
She
can
not
be
justified
in
it
.
Dress
*NL*
is
at
all
times
a
frivolous
distinction
,
and
excessive
solicitude
about
*NL*
it
often
destroys
its
own
aim
.
Catherine
knew
all
this
very
well
;
her
*NL*
great
aunt
had
read
her
a
lecture
on
the
subject
only
the
Christmas
*NL*
before
;
and
yet
she
lay
awake
ten
minutes
on
Wednesday
night
debating
*NL*
between
her
spotted
and
her
tamboured
muslin
,
and
nothing
but
the
*NL*
shortness
of
the
time
prevented
her
buying
a
new
one
for
the
evening
.
*NL*
This
would
have
been
an
error
in
judgment
,
great
though
not
uncommon
,
*NL*
from
which
one
of
the
other
sex
rather
than
her
own
,
a
brother
rather
*NL*
than
a
great
aunt
,
might
have
warned
her
,
for
man
only
can
be
aware
of
*NL*
the
insensibility
of
man
towards
a
new
gown
.
It
would
be
mortifying
to
*NL*
the
feelings
of
many
ladies
,
could
they
be
made
to
understand
how
little
*NL*
the
heart
of
man
is
affected
by
what
is
costly
or
new
in
their
attire
;
*NL*
how
little
it
is
biased
by
the
texture
of
their
muslin
,
and
how
*NL*
unsusceptible
of
peculiar
tenderness
towards
the
spotted
,
the
sprigged
,
*NL*
the
mull
,
or
the
jackonet
.
Woman
is
fine
for
her
own
satisfaction
alone
.
*NL*
No
man
will
admire
her
the
more
,
no
woman
will
like
her
the
better
for
*NL*
it
.
Neatness
and
fashion
are
enough
for
the
former
,
and
a
something
of
*NL*
shabbiness
or
impropriety
will
be
most
endearing
to
the
latter
.
But
not
*NL*
one
of
these
grave
reflections
troubled
the
tranquillity
of
Catherine
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
entered
the
rooms
on
Thursday
evening
with
feelings
very
different
*NL*
from
what
had
attended
her
thither
the
Monday
before
.
She
had
then
been
*NL*
exulting
in
her
engagement
to
Thorpe
,
and
was
now
chiefly
anxious
to
*NL*
avoid
his
sight
,
lest
he
should
engage
her
again
;
for
though
she
could
*NL*
not
,
dared
not
expect
that
Mr.
Tilney
should
ask
her
a
third
time
to
*NL*
dance
,
her
wishes
,
hopes
,
and
plans
all
centred
in
nothing
less
.
Every
*NL*
young
lady
may
feel
for
my
heroine
in
this
critical
moment
,
for
every
*NL*
young
lady
has
at
some
time
or
other
known
the
same
agitation
.
All
have
*NL*
been
,
or
at
least
all
have
believed
themselves
to
be
,
in
danger
from
the
*NL*
pursuit
of
someone
whom
they
wished
to
avoid
;
and
all
have
been
anxious
*NL*
for
the
attentions
of
someone
whom
they
wished
to
please
.
As
soon
as
*NL*
they
were
joined
by
the
Thorpes
,
Catherine
's
agony
began
;
she
fidgeted
*NL*
about
if
John
Thorpe
came
towards
her
,
hid
herself
as
much
as
possible
*NL*
from
his
view
,
and
when
he
spoke
to
her
pretended
not
to
hear
him
.
The
*NL*
cotillions
were
over
,
the
country-dancing
beginning
,
and
she
saw
nothing
*NL*
of
the
Tilneys
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
not
be
frightened
,
my
dear
Catherine
,
''
whispered
Isabella
,
``
but
I
am
*NL*
really
going
to
dance
with
your
brother
again
.
I
declare
positively
it
*NL*
is
quite
shocking
.
I
tell
him
he
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
himself
,
but
you
*NL*
and
John
must
keep
us
in
countenance
.
Make
haste
,
my
dear
creature
,
and
*NL*
come
to
us
.
John
is
just
walked
off
,
but
he
will
be
back
in
a
moment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Catherine
had
neither
time
nor
inclination
to
answer
.
The
others
walked
*NL*
away
,
John
Thorpe
was
still
in
view
,
and
she
gave
herself
up
for
lost
.
*NL*
That
she
might
not
appear
,
however
,
to
observe
or
expect
him
,
she
kept
*NL*
her
eyes
intently
fixed
on
her
fan
;
and
a
self-condemnation
for
her
*NL*
folly
,
in
supposing
that
among
such
a
crowd
they
should
even
meet
with
*NL*
the
Tilneys
in
any
reasonable
time
,
had
just
passed
through
her
mind
,
*NL*
when
she
suddenly
found
herself
addressed
and
again
solicited
to
dance
,
*NL*
by
Mr.
Tilney
himself
.
With
what
sparkling
eyes
and
ready
motion
she
*NL*
granted
his
request
,
and
with
how
pleasing
a
flutter
of
heart
she
went
*NL*
with
him
to
the
set
,
may
be
easily
imagined
.
To
escape
,
and
,
as
*NL*
she
believed
,
so
narrowly
escape
John
Thorpe
,
and
to
be
asked
,
so
*NL*
immediately
on
his
joining
her
,
asked
by
Mr.
Tilney
,
as
if
he
had
sought
*NL*
her
on
purpose
!
--
it
did
not
appear
to
her
that
life
could
supply
any
*NL*
greater
felicity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Scarcely
had
they
worked
themselves
into
the
quiet
possession
of
a
*NL*
place
,
however
,
when
her
attention
was
claimed
by
John
Thorpe
,
who
stood
*NL*
behind
her
.
``
Heyday
,
Miss
Morland
!
''
said
he
.
``
What
is
the
meaning
of
*NL*
this
?
I
thought
you
and
I
were
to
dance
together
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wonder
you
should
think
so
,
for
you
never
asked
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
a
good
one
,
by
Jove
!
I
asked
you
as
soon
as
I
came
into
the
*NL*
room
,
and
I
was
just
going
to
ask
you
again
,
but
when
I
turned
round
,
*NL*
you
were
gone
!
This
is
a
cursed
shabby
trick
!
I
only
came
for
the
sake
*NL*
of
dancing
with
you
,
and
I
firmly
believe
you
were
engaged
to
me
ever
*NL*
since
Monday
.
Yes
;
I
remember
,
I
asked
you
while
you
were
waiting
in
the
*NL*
lobby
for
your
cloak
.
And
here
have
I
been
telling
all
my
acquaintance
*NL*
that
I
was
going
to
dance
with
the
prettiest
girl
in
the
room
;
and
*NL*
when
they
see
you
standing
up
with
somebody
else
,
they
will
quiz
me
*NL*
famously
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
;
they
will
never
think
of
me
,
after
such
a
description
as
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
heavens
,
if
they
do
not
,
I
will
kick
them
out
of
the
room
for
*NL*
blockheads
.
What
chap
have
you
there
?
''
Catherine
satisfied
his
*NL*
curiosity
.
``
Tilney
,
''
he
repeated
.
``
Hum
--
I
do
not
know
him
.
A
good
figure
*NL*
of
a
man
;
well
put
together
.
Does
he
want
a
horse
?
Here
is
a
friend
*NL*
of
mine
,
Sam
Fletcher
,
has
got
one
to
sell
that
would
suit
anybody
.
A
*NL*
famous
clever
animal
for
the
road
--
only
forty
guineas
.
I
had
fifty
minds
*NL*
to
buy
it
myself
,
for
it
is
one
of
my
maxims
always
to
buy
a
good
horse
*NL*
when
I
meet
with
one
;
but
it
would
not
answer
my
purpose
,
it
would
not
*NL*
do
for
the
field
.
I
would
give
any
money
for
a
real
good
hunter
.
I
*NL*
have
three
now
,
the
best
that
ever
were
backed
.
I
would
not
take
*NL*
eight
hundred
guineas
for
them
.
Fletcher
and
I
mean
to
get
a
house
in
*NL*
Leicestershire
,
against
the
next
season
.
It
is
so
d
--
uncomfortable
,
*NL*
living
at
an
inn
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
last
sentence
by
which
he
could
weary
Catherine
's
*NL*
attention
,
for
he
was
just
then
borne
off
by
the
resistless
pressure
of
*NL*
a
long
string
of
passing
ladies
.
Her
partner
now
drew
near
,
and
said
,
*NL*
``
That
gentleman
would
have
put
me
out
of
patience
,
had
he
stayed
with
*NL*
you
half
a
minute
longer
.
He
has
no
business
to
withdraw
the
attention
*NL*
of
my
partner
from
me
.
We
have
entered
into
a
contract
of
mutual
*NL*
agreeableness
for
the
space
of
an
evening
,
and
all
our
agreeableness
*NL*
belongs
solely
to
each
other
for
that
time
.
Nobody
can
fasten
themselves
*NL*
on
the
notice
of
one
,
without
injuring
the
rights
of
the
other
.
*NL*
I
consider
a
country-dance
as
an
emblem
of
marriage
.
Fidelity
and
*NL*
complaisance
are
the
principal
duties
of
both
;
and
those
men
who
do
not
*NL*
choose
to
dance
or
marry
themselves
,
have
no
business
with
the
partners
*NL*
or
wives
of
their
neighbours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
they
are
such
very
different
things
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
--
That
you
think
they
can
not
be
compared
together
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
be
sure
not
.
People
that
marry
can
never
part
,
but
must
go
and
keep
*NL*
house
together
.
People
that
dance
only
stand
opposite
each
other
in
a
*NL*
long
room
for
half
an
hour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
such
is
your
definition
of
matrimony
and
dancing
.
Taken
in
that
*NL*
light
certainly
,
their
resemblance
is
not
striking
;
but
I
think
I
could
*NL*
place
them
in
such
a
view
.
You
will
allow
,
that
in
both
,
man
has
the
*NL*
advantage
of
choice
,
woman
only
the
power
of
refusal
;
that
in
both
,
*NL*
it
is
an
engagement
between
man
and
woman
,
formed
for
the
advantage
of
*NL*
each
;
and
that
when
once
entered
into
,
they
belong
exclusively
to
each
*NL*
other
till
the
moment
of
its
dissolution
;
that
it
is
their
duty
,
each
*NL*
to
endeavour
to
give
the
other
no
cause
for
wishing
that
he
or
she
had
*NL*
bestowed
themselves
elsewhere
,
and
their
best
interest
to
keep
their
own
*NL*
imaginations
from
wandering
towards
the
perfections
of
their
neighbours
,
*NL*
or
fancying
that
they
should
have
been
better
off
with
anyone
else
.
You
*NL*
will
allow
all
this
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
to
be
sure
,
as
you
state
it
,
all
this
sounds
very
well
;
but
still
*NL*
they
are
so
very
different
.
I
can
not
look
upon
them
at
all
in
the
same
*NL*
light
,
nor
think
the
same
duties
belong
to
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
one
respect
,
there
certainly
is
a
difference
.
In
marriage
,
the
man
*NL*
is
supposed
to
provide
for
the
support
of
the
woman
,
the
woman
to
make
*NL*
the
home
agreeable
to
the
man
;
he
is
to
purvey
,
and
she
is
to
smile
.
*NL*
But
in
dancing
,
their
duties
are
exactly
changed
;
the
agreeableness
,
the
*NL*
compliance
are
expected
from
him
,
while
she
furnishes
the
fan
and
the
*NL*
lavender
water
.
That
,
I
suppose
,
was
the
difference
of
duties
which
*NL*
struck
you
,
as
rendering
the
conditions
incapable
of
comparison
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
indeed
,
I
never
thought
of
that

*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
am
quite
at
a
loss

One
thing
,
however

I
must
observe

This
*NL*
disposition
on
your
side
is
rather
alarming
.
You
totally
disallow
any
*NL*
similarity
in
the
obligations
;
and
may
I
not
thence
infer
that
your
*NL*
notions
of
the
duties
of
the
dancing
state
are
not
so
strict
as
your
*NL*
partner
might
wish
?
Have
I
not
reason
to
fear
that
if
the
gentleman
who
*NL*
spoke
to
you
just
now
were
to
return
,
or
if
any
other
gentleman
were
to
*NL*
address
you
,
there
would
be
nothing
to
restrain
you
from
conversing
with
*NL*
him
as
long
as
you
chose
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Thorpe

such
a
very
particular
friend

I
must
talk
to
him
again

there

him

I

other

never

variety

I
can
know

nothing
of
there

*NL*
``
Yes

I
am

I
have
always
lived
there

and
always
been
very
happy

But
*NL*
certainly
there
is
much
more
sameness
in
a
country
life
than
in
a
Bath
*NL*
life
.
One
day
in
the
country
is
exactly
like
another

*NL*
``
But
then
you
spend
your

so
much
more

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
not

I
walk
about

here

and
so
I
do
there

but
here
I
see
a
variety
of
people
in
every

street

there
I
can
only
go
and
call
on
Mrs.

*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Tilney
was
very
much
amused
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
go
and
call
on
Mrs.
Allen
!
''
he
repeated
.
``
What
a
picture
of
*NL*
intellectual
poverty
!
However
,
when
you
sink
into
this
abyss
again
,
you
*NL*
will
have
more
to
say
.
You
will
be
able
to
talk
of
Bath
,
and
of
all
that
*NL*
you
did
here
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
Yes

I
shall
never
be
in
want

something
to
talk
of
again
to
Mrs.

,
or
anybody
else
.
I
really
believe
I
shall
always
be
talking
of
*NL*
Bath
,
when
I
am
at
home
again
--
I
do
like
it
so
very
much
.
If
I
could
but
*NL*
have
Papa
and
Mamma
,
and
the
rest
of
them
here
,
I
suppose
I
should
be
*NL*
too
happy
!
James
's
coming
-LRB-
my
eldest
brother
-RRB-
is
quite
delightful
--
and
*NL*
especially
as
it
turns
out
that
the
very
family
we
are
just
got
so
*NL*
intimate
with
are
his
intimate
friends
already
.
Oh
!
Who
can
ever
be
*NL*
tired
of
Bath
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
those
who
bring
such
fresh
feelings

to
it
as
you
do

*NL*
But
papas
and
mammas
,
and
brothers
,
and
intimate
friends
are
a
good
deal
*NL*
gone
by
,
to
most
of
the
frequenters
of
Bath
--
and
the
honest
relish
of
*NL*
balls
and
plays
,
and
everyday
sights
,
is
past
with
them
.
''
Here
*NL*
their
conversation
closed
,
the
demands
of
the
dance
becoming
now
too
*NL*
importunate
for
a
divided
attention
.
*NL*
*NL*
Soon
after
their
reaching
the
bottom
of
the
set
,
Catherine
perceived
*NL*
herself
to
be
earnestly
regarded
by
a
gentleman
who
stood
among
the
*NL*
lookers-on
,
immediately
behind
her
partner
.
He
was
a
very
handsome
man
,
*NL*
of
a
commanding
aspect
,
past
the
bloom
,
but
not
past
the
vigour
of
*NL*
life
;
and
with
his
eye
still
directed
towards
her
,
she
saw
him
presently
*NL*
address
Mr.
Tilney
in
a
familiar
whisper
.
Confused
by
his
notice
,
and
*NL*
blushing
from
the
fear
of
its
being
excited
by
something
wrong
in
*NL*
her
appearance
,
she
turned
away
her
head
.
But
while
she
did
so
,
the
*NL*
gentleman
retreated
,
and
her
partner
,
coming
nearer
,
said
,
``
I
see
that
*NL*
you
guess
what
I
have
just
been
asked
.
That
gentleman
knows
your
name
,
*NL*
and
you
have
a
right
to
know
his
.
It
is
General
Tilney
,
my
father
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Catherine
's
answer
was
only
``
Oh
!
''
--
but
it
was
an
``
Oh
!
''
expressing
*NL*
everything
needful
:
attention
to
his
words
,
and
perfect
reliance
on
*NL*
their
truth
.
With
real
interest
and
strong
admiration
did
her
eye
now
*NL*
follow
the
general
,
as
he
moved
through
the
crowd
,
and
``
How
handsome
a
*NL*
family
they
are
!
''
was
her
secret
remark
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
chatting
with
Miss
Tilney
before
the
evening
concluded
,
a
new
source
*NL*
of
felicity
arose
to
her
.
She
had
never
taken
a
country
walk
since
*NL*
her
arrival
in
Bath
.
Miss
Tilney
,
to
whom
all
the
commonly
frequented
*NL*
environs
were
familiar
,
spoke
of
them
in
terms
which
made
her
all
*NL*
eagerness
to
know
them
too
;
and
on
her
openly
fearing
that
she
might
*NL*
find
nobody
to
go
with
her
,
it
was
proposed
by
the
brother
and
sister
*NL*
that
they
should
join
in
a
walk
,
some
morning
or
other
.
``
I
shall
like
*NL*
it
,
''
she
cried
,
``
beyond
anything
in
the
world
;
and
do
not
let
us
put
*NL*
it
off
--
let
us
go
tomorrow
.
''
This
was
readily
agreed
to
,
with
only
a
*NL*
proviso
of
Miss
Tilney
's
,
that
it
did
not
rain
,
which
Catherine
was
sure
*NL*
it
would
not
.
At
twelve
o'clock
,
they
were
to
call
for
her
in
Pulteney
*NL*
Street
;
and
``
Remember
--
twelve
o'clock
,
''
was
her
parting
speech
to
*NL*
her
new
friend
.
Of
her
other
,
her
older
,
her
more
established
friend
,
*NL*
Isabella
,
of
whose
fidelity
and
worth
she
had
enjoyed
a
fortnight
's
*NL*
experience
,
she
scarcely
saw
anything
during
the
evening
.
Yet
,
though
*NL*
longing
to
make
her
acquainted
with
her
happiness
,
she
cheerfully
*NL*
submitted
to
the
wish
of
Mr.
Allen
,
which
took
them
rather
early
away
,
*NL*
and
her
spirits
danced
within
her
,
as
she
danced
in
her
chair
all
the
*NL*
way
home
.

CHAPTER
11
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
morrow
brought
a
very
sober-looking
morning
,
the
sun
making
only
*NL*
a
few
efforts
to
appear
,
and
Catherine
augured
from
it
everything
most
*NL*
favourable
to
her
wishes
.
A
bright
morning
so
early
in
the
year
,
*NL*
she
allowed
,
would
generally
turn
to
rain
,
but
a
cloudy
one
foretold
*NL*
improvement
as
the
day
advanced
.
She
applied
to
Mr.
Allen
for
*NL*
confirmation
of
her
hopes
,
but
Mr.
Allen
,
not
having
his
own
skies
and
*NL*
barometer
about
him
,
declined
giving
any
absolute
promise
of
sunshine
.
*NL*
She
applied
to
Mrs.
Allen
,
and
Mrs.
Allen
's
opinion
was
more
positive
.
*NL*
``
She
had
no
doubt
in
the
world
of
its
being
a
very
fine
day
,
if
the
*NL*
clouds
would
only
go
off
,
and
the
sun
keep
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
about
eleven
o'clock
,
however
,
a
few
specks
of
small
rain
upon
the
*NL*
windows
caught
Catherine
's
watchful
eye
,
and
``
Oh
!
dear
,
I
do
believe
it
*NL*
will
be
wet
,
''
broke
from
her
in
a
most
desponding
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
how
it
would
be
,
''
said
Mrs.
Allen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
walk
for
me
today
,
''
sighed
Catherine
;
``
but
perhaps
it
may
come
to
*NL*
nothing
,
or
it
may
hold
up
before
twelve
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
it
may
,
but
then
,
my
dear
,
it
will
be
so
dirty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
That
will
not
signify
;
I
never
mind
dirt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
replied
her
friend
very
placidly
,
``
I
know
you
never
mind
dirt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
short
pause
,
``
It
comes
on
faster
and
faster
!
''
said
Catherine
,
as
*NL*
she
stood
watching
at
a
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
it
does
indeed
.
If
it
keeps
raining
,
the
streets
will
be
very
wet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
four
umbrellas
up
already
.
How
I
hate
the
sight
of
an
*NL*
umbrella
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
disagreeable
things
to
carry
.
I
would
much
rather
take
a
chair
*NL*
at
any
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
such
a
nice-looking
morning
!
I
felt
so
convinced
it
would
be
*NL*
dry
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anybody
would
have
thought
so
indeed
.
There
will
be
very
few
people
in
*NL*
the
pump-room
,
if
it
rains
all
the
morning
.
I
hope
Mr.
Allen
will
put
*NL*
on
his
greatcoat
when
he
goes
,
but
I
dare
say
he
will
not
,
for
he
had
*NL*
rather
do
anything
in
the
world
than
walk
out
in
a
greatcoat
;
I
wonder
*NL*
he
should
dislike
it
,
it
must
be
so
comfortable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
rain
continued
--
fast
,
though
not
heavy
.
Catherine
went
every
five
*NL*
minutes
to
the
clock
,
threatening
on
each
return
that
,
if
it
still
*NL*
kept
on
raining
another
five
minutes
,
she
would
give
up
the
matter
as
*NL*
hopeless
.
The
clock
struck
twelve
,
and
it
still
rained
.
``
You
will
not
be
*NL*
able
to
go
,
my
dear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
quite
despair
yet
.
I
shall
not
give
it
up
till
a
quarter
after
*NL*
twelve
.
This
is
just
the
time
of
day
for
it
to
clear
up
,
and
I
do
think
*NL*
it
looks
a
little
lighter
.
There
,
it
is
twenty
minutes
after
twelve
,
and
*NL*
now
I
shall
give
it
up
entirely
.
Oh
!
That
we
had
such
weather
here
*NL*
as
they
had
at
Udolpho
,
or
at
least
in
Tuscany
and
the
south
of
*NL*
France
!
--
the
night
that
poor
St.
Aubin
died
!
--
such
beautiful
weather
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
half
past
twelve
,
when
Catherine
's
anxious
attention
to
the
weather
*NL*
was
over
and
she
could
no
longer
claim
any
merit
from
its
amendment
,
the
*NL*
sky
began
voluntarily
to
clear
.
A
gleam
of
sunshine
took
her
quite
by
*NL*
surprise
;
she
looked
round
;
the
clouds
were
parting
,
and
she
instantly
*NL*
returned
to
the
window
to
watch
over
and
encourage
the
happy
appearance
.
*NL*
Ten
minutes
more
made
it
certain
that
a
bright
afternoon
would
succeed
,
*NL*
and
justified
the
opinion
of
Mrs.
Allen
,
who
had
``
always
thought
it
*NL*
would
clear
up
.
''
But
whether
Catherine
might
still
expect
her
friends
,
*NL*
whether
there
had
not
been
too
much
rain
for
Miss
Tilney
to
venture
,
*NL*
must
yet
be
a
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
too
dirty
for
Mrs.
Allen
to
accompany
her
husband
to
the
*NL*
pump-room
;
he
accordingly
set
off
by
himself
,
and
Catherine
had
barely
*NL*
watched
him
down
the
street
when
her
notice
was
claimed
by
the
approach
*NL*
of
the
same
two
open
carriages
,
containing
the
same
three
people
that
*NL*
had
surprised
her
so
much
a
few
mornings
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Isabella
,
my
brother
,
and
Mr.
Thorpe
,
I
declare
!
They
are
coming
for
*NL*
me
perhaps
--
but
I
shall
not
go
--
I
can
not
go
indeed
,
for
you
know
Miss
*NL*
Tilney
may
still
call
.
''
Mrs.
Allen
agreed
to
it
.
John
Thorpe
was
soon
*NL*
with
them
,
and
his
voice
was
with
them
yet
sooner
,
for
on
the
stairs
he
*NL*
was
calling
out
to
Miss
Morland
to
be
quick
.
``
Make
haste
!
Make
haste
!
''
*NL*
as
he
threw
open
the
door
.
``
Put
on
your
hat
this
moment
--
there
is
no
*NL*
time
to
be
lost

are
going

d'ye
do

Mrs.
Allen

*NL*
*NL*
``
To
Bristol

not
that
a
great
way
off

however

I
can
not
go
with
*NL*
you
today
,
because
I
am
engaged
;
I
expect
some
friends
every
moment

*NL*
This
was
of
course
vehemently
talked
down
as
no
reason
at
all
;
Mrs.
*NL*
Allen
was
called
on
to
second
him
,
and
the
two
others
walked
in
,
to
give
*NL*
their
assistance
.
``
My
sweetest
Catherine

is
not
this
delightful

We

shall
have
a

heavenly
drive

You
are
to
thank
your
brother
and
me
*NL*
for
the
scheme
;
it
darted
into
our
heads
at
breakfast-time
,
I
verily
*NL*
believe
at
the
same
instant
;

we
should
have
been
off
two
hours
ago

it
had
not
been
for
this
detestable
rain

it
does
not
signify

the
nights
are
moonlight

we
shall
do
delightfully

Oh

I
am
in
such
*NL*
ecstasies
at
the
thoughts
of
a
little
country
air
and
quiet
!
So
much
*NL*
better
than
going
to
the
Lower
Rooms

We
shall
drive
directly
to
Clifton

dine
there

as
soon

dinner
is
over

there
is
time

Kingsweston

*NL*
``
I
doubt

being
able

so
much

said
Morland
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

Thorpe

.
They
promised
to
come
at
twelve
,
only
it
rained
;
but
now
,
*NL*
as
it
is
so
fine
,
I
dare
say
they
will
be
here
soon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
they
indeed
,
''
cried
Thorpe
;
``
for
,
as
we
turned
into
Broad
Street
,
I
*NL*
saw
them
--
does
he
not
drive
a
phaeton
with
bright
chestnuts
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
know
indeed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
know
he
does
;
I
saw
him
.
You
are
talking
of
the
man
you
danced
*NL*
with
last
night
,
are
not
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
saw
him
at
that
moment
turn
up
the
Lansdown
Road
,
driving
a
*NL*
smart-looking
girl
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
indeed
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
upon
my
soul
;
knew
him
again
directly
,
and
he
seemed
to
have
got
*NL*
some
very
pretty
cattle
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
very
odd
!
But
I
suppose
they
thought
it
would
be
too
dirty
for
a
*NL*
walk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
well
they
might
,
for
I
never
saw
so
much
dirt
in
my
life
.
Walk
!
*NL*
You
could
no
more
walk
than
you
could
fly
!
It
has
not
been
so
dirty
the
*NL*
whole
winter
;
it
is
ankle-deep
everywhere
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabella
corroborated
it
:
``
My
dearest
Catherine
,
you
can
not
form
an
idea
*NL*
of
the
dirt
;
come
,
you
must
go
;
you
can
not
refuse
going
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
like
to
see
the
castle
;
but
may
we
go
all
over
it
?
May
we
go
*NL*
up
every
staircase
,
and
into
every
suite
of
rooms
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
every
hole
and
corner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
then
,
if
they
should
only
be
gone
out
for
an
hour
till
it
is
dryer
,
*NL*
and
call
by
and
by
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Make
yourself
easy
,
there
is
no
danger
of
that
,
for
I
heard
Tilney
*NL*
hallooing
to
a
man
who
was
just
passing
by
on
horseback
,
that
they
were
*NL*
going
as
far
as
Wick
Rocks
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
will
.
Shall
I
go
,
Mrs.
Allen
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
as
you
please
,
my
dear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mrs.
Allen
,
you
must
persuade
her
to
go
,
''
was
the
general
cry
.
Mrs.
*NL*
Allen
was
not
inattentive
to
it
:
``
Well
,
my
dear
,
''
said
she
,
``
suppose
you
*NL*
go
.
''
And
in
two
minutes
they
were
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
Catherine
's
feelings
,
as
she
got
into
the
carriage
,
were
in
a
very
*NL*
unsettled
state
;
divided
between
regret
for
the
loss
of
one
great
*NL*
pleasure
,
and
the
hope
of
soon
enjoying
another
,
almost
its
equal
in
*NL*
degree
,
however
unlike
in
kind
.
She
could
not
think
the
Tilneys
had
*NL*
acted
quite
well
by
her
,
in
so
readily
giving
up
their
engagement
,
*NL*
without
sending
her
any
message
of
excuse
.
It
was
now
but
an
hour
later
*NL*
than
the
time
fixed
on
for
the
beginning
of
their
walk
;
and
,
in
spite
of
*NL*
what
she
had
heard
of
the
prodigious
accumulation
of
dirt
in
the
course
*NL*
of
that
hour
,
she
could
not
from
her
own
observation
help
thinking
that
*NL*
they
might
have
gone
with
very
little
inconvenience
.
To
feel
herself
*NL*
slighted
by
them
was
very
painful
.
On
the
other
hand
,
the
delight
of
*NL*
exploring
an
edifice
like
Udolpho
,
as
her
fancy
represented
Blaize
*NL*
Castle
to
be
,
was
such
a
counterpoise
of
good
as
might
console
her
for
*NL*
almost
anything
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
passed
briskly
down
Pulteney
Street
,
and
through
Laura
Place
,
*NL*
without
the
exchange
of
many
words
.
Thorpe
talked
to
his
horse
,
and
she
*NL*
meditated
,
by
turns
,
on
broken
promises
and
broken
arches
,
phaetons
*NL*
and
false
hangings
,
Tilneys
and
trap-doors
.
As
they
entered
Argyle
*NL*
Buildings
,
however
,
she
was
roused
by
this
address
from
her
companion
,
*NL*
``
Who
is
that
girl
who
looked
at
you
so
hard
as
she
went
by
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
?
Where
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
right-hand
pavement
--
she
must
be
almost
out
of
sight
now
.
''
*NL*
Catherine
looked
round
and
saw
Miss
Tilney
leaning
on
her
brother
's
arm
,
*NL*
walking
slowly
down
the
street
.
She
saw
them
both
looking
back
at
her
.
*NL*
``
Stop
,
stop
,
Mr.
Thorpe
,
''
she
impatiently
cried
;
``
it
is
Miss
Tilney
;
it
*NL*
is
indeed
.
How
could
you
tell
me
they
were
gone
?
Stop
,
stop
,
I
will
*NL*
get
out
this
moment
and
go
to
them
.
''
But
to
what
purpose
did
she
speak
?
*NL*
Thorpe
only
lashed
his
horse
into
a
brisker
trot
;
the
Tilneys
,
who
had
*NL*
soon
ceased
to
look
after
her
,
were
in
a
moment
out
of
sight
round
the
*NL*
corner
of
Laura
Place
,
and
in
another
moment
she
was
herself
whisked
*NL*
into
the
marketplace
.
Still
,
however
,
and
during
the
length
of
another
*NL*
street
,
she
entreated
him
to
stop
.
``
Pray
,
pray
stop
,
Mr.
Thorpe
.
I
*NL*
can
not
go
on
.
I
will
not
go
on
.
I
must
go
back
to
Miss
Tilney
.
''
But
Mr.
*NL*
Thorpe
only
laughed
,
smacked
his
whip
,
encouraged
his
horse
,
made
odd
*NL*
noises
,
and
drove
on
;
and
Catherine
,
angry
and
vexed
as
she
was
,
having
*NL*
no
power
of
getting
away
,
was
obliged
to
give
up
the
point
and
submit
.
*NL*
Her
reproaches
,
however
,
were
not
spared
.
``
How
could
you
deceive
me
so
,
*NL*
Mr.
Thorpe
?
How
could
you
say
that
you
saw
them
driving
up
the
Lansdown
*NL*
Road
?
I
would
not
have
had
it
happen
so
for
the
world
.
They
must
think
*NL*
it
so
strange
,
so
rude
of
me
!
To
go
by
them
,
too
,
without
saying
a
word
!
*NL*
You
do
not
know
how
vexed
I
am
;
I
shall
have
no
pleasure
at
Clifton
,
nor
*NL*
in
anything
else
.
I
had
rather
,
ten
thousand
times
rather
,
get
out
now
,
*NL*
and
walk
back
to
them
.
How
could
you
say
you
saw
them
driving
out
in
a
*NL*
phaeton
?
''
Thorpe
defended
himself
very
stoutly
,
declared
he
had
never
*NL*
seen
two
men
so
much
alike
in
his
life
,
and
would
hardly
give
up
the
*NL*
point
of
its
having
been
Tilney
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Their
drive
,
even
when
this
subject
was
over
,
was
not
likely
to
be
very
*NL*
agreeable
.
Catherine
's
complaisance
was
no
longer
what
it
had
been
in
*NL*
their
former
airing
.
She
listened
reluctantly
,
and
her
replies
were
*NL*
short
.
Blaize
Castle
remained
her
only
comfort
;
towards
that
,
she
still
*NL*
looked
at
intervals
with
pleasure
;
though
rather
than
be
disappointed
of
*NL*
the
promised
walk
,
and
especially
rather
than
be
thought
ill
of
by
the
*NL*
Tilneys
,
she
would
willingly
have
given
up
all
the
happiness
which
its
*NL*
walls
could
supply
--
the
happiness
of
a
progress
through
a
long
suite
of
*NL*
lofty
rooms
,
exhibiting
the
remains
of
magnificent
furniture
,
though
*NL*
now
for
many
years
deserted
--
the
happiness
of
being
stopped
in
their
way
*NL*
along
narrow
,
winding
vaults
,
by
a
low
,
grated
door
;
or
even
of
having
*NL*
their
lamp
,
their
only
lamp
,
extinguished
by
a
sudden
gust
of
wind
,
and
*NL*
of
being
left
in
total
darkness
.
In
the
meanwhile
,
they
proceeded
on
*NL*
their
journey
without
any
mischance
,
and
were
within
view
of
the
town
*NL*
of
Keynsham
,
when
a
halloo
from
Morland
,
who
was
behind
them
,
made
his
*NL*
friend
pull
up
,
to
know
what
was
the
matter
.
The
others
then
came
close
*NL*
enough
for
conversation
,
and
Morland
said
,
``
We
had
better
go
back
,
*NL*
Thorpe
;
it
is
too
late
to
go
on
today
;
your
sister
thinks
so
as
well
as
*NL*
I
.
We
have
been
exactly
an
hour
coming
from
Pulteney
Street
,
very
little
*NL*
more
than
seven
miles
;
and
,
I
suppose
,
we
have
at
least
eight
more
to
*NL*
go
.
It
will
never
do
.
We
set
out
a
great
deal
too
late
.
We
had
much
*NL*
better
put
it
off
till
another
day
,
and
turn
round
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
all
one
to
me
,
''
replied
Thorpe
rather
angrily
;
and
instantly
*NL*
turning
his
horse
,
they
were
on
their
way
back
to
Bath
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
your
brother
had
not
got
such
a
d
--
beast
to
drive
,
''
said
he
soon
*NL*
afterwards
,
``
we
might
have
done
it
very
well
.
My
horse
would
have
*NL*
trotted
to
Clifton
within
the
hour
,
if
left
to
himself
,
and
I
have
*NL*
almost
broke
my
arm
with
pulling
him
in
to
that
cursed
broken-winded
*NL*
jade
's
pace
.
Morland
is
a
fool
for
not
keeping
a
horse
and
gig
of
his
*NL*
own
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
he
is
not
,
''
said
Catherine
warmly
,
``
for
I
am
sure
he
could
not
*NL*
afford
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
why
can
not
he
afford
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
he
has
not
money
enough
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
whose
fault
is
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nobody
's
,
that
I
know
of
.
''
Thorpe
then
said
something
in
the
loud
,
*NL*
incoherent
way
to
which
he
had
often
recourse
,
about
its
being
a
*NL*
d
--
thing
to
be
miserly
;
and
that
if
people
who
rolled
in
money
could
not
*NL*
afford
things
,
he
did
not
know
who
could
,
which
Catherine
did
not
even
*NL*
endeavour
to
understand
.
Disappointed
of
what
was
to
have
been
the
*NL*
consolation
for
her
first
disappointment
,
she
was
less
and
less
disposed
*NL*
either
to
be
agreeable
herself
or
to
find
her
companion
so
;
and
they
*NL*
returned
to
Pulteney
Street
without
her
speaking
twenty
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
entered
the
house
,
the
footman
told
her
that
a
gentleman
and
lady
*NL*
had
called
and
inquired
for
her
a
few
minutes
after
her
setting
off
;
*NL*
that
,
when
he
told
them
she
was
gone
out
with
Mr.
Thorpe
,
the
lady
had
*NL*
asked
whether
any
message
had
been
left
for
her
;
and
on
his
saying
no
,
*NL*
had
felt
for
a
card
,
but
said
she
had
none
about
her
,
and
went
away
.
*NL*
Pondering
over
these
heart-rending
tidings
,
Catherine
walked
slowly
*NL*
upstairs
.
At
the
head
of
them
she
was
met
by
Mr.
Allen
,
who
,
on
hearing
*NL*
the
reason
of
their
speedy
return
,
said
,
``
I
am
glad
your
brother
had
so
*NL*
much
sense
;
I
am
glad
you
are
come
back
.
It
was
a
strange
,
wild
scheme
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
all
spent
the
evening
together
at
Thorpe
's
.
Catherine
was
disturbed
*NL*
and
out
of
spirits
;
but
Isabella
seemed
to
find
a
pool
of
commerce
,
in
*NL*
the
fate
of
which
she
shared
,
by
private
partnership
with
Morland
,
a
*NL*
very
good
equivalent
for
the
quiet
and
country
air
of
an
inn
at
Clifton
.
*NL*
Her
satisfaction
,
too
,
in
not
being
at
the
Lower
Rooms
was
spoken
more
*NL*
than
once
.
``
How
I
pity
the
poor
creatures
that
are
going
there
!
How
glad
*NL*
I
am
that
I
am
not
amongst
them
!
I
wonder
whether
it
will
be
a
full
ball
*NL*
or
not
!
They
have
not
begun
dancing
yet
.
I
would
not
be
there
for
*NL*
all
the
world
.
It
is
so
delightful
to
have
an
evening
now
and
then
*NL*
to
oneself
.
I
dare
say
it
will
not
be
a
very
good
ball
.
I
know
the
*NL*
Mitchells
will
not
be
there
.
I
am
sure
I
pity
everybody
that
is
.
But
I
*NL*
dare
say
,
Mr.
Morland
,
you
long
to
be
at
it
,
do
not
you
?
I
am
sure
you
*NL*
do
.
Well
,
pray
do
not
let
anybody
here
be
a
restraint
on
you
.
I
dare
say
*NL*
we
could
do
very
well
without
you
;
but
you
men
think
yourselves
of
such
*NL*
consequence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Catherine
could
almost
have
accused
Isabella
of
being
wanting
in
*NL*
tenderness
towards
herself
and
her
sorrows
,
so
very
little
did
they
*NL*
appear
to
dwell
on
her
mind
,
and
so
very
inadequate
was
the
comfort
she
*NL*
offered
.
``
Do
not
be
so
dull
,
my
dearest
creature
,
''
she
whispered
.
``
You
*NL*
will
quite
break
my
heart
.
It
was
amazingly
shocking
,
to
be
sure
;
but
*NL*
the
Tilneys
were
entirely
to
blame
.
Why
were
not
they
more
punctual
?
*NL*
It
was
dirty
,
indeed
,
but
what
did
that
signify
?
I
am
sure
John
and
I
*NL*
should
not
have
minded
it
.
I
never
mind
going
through
anything
,
where
a
*NL*
friend
is
concerned
;
that
is
my
disposition
,
and
John
is
just
the
same
;
*NL*
he
has
amazing
strong
feelings
.
Good
heavens
!
What
a
delightful
hand
you
*NL*
have
got
!
Kings
,
I
vow
!
I
never
was
so
happy
in
my
life
!
I
would
fifty
*NL*
times
rather
you
should
have
them
than
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
I
may
dismiss
my
heroine
to
the
sleepless
couch
,
which
is
the
*NL*
true
heroine
's
portion
;
to
a
pillow
strewed
with
thorns
and
wet
with
*NL*
tears
.
And
lucky
may
she
think
herself
,
if
she
get
another
good
night
's
*NL*
rest
in
the
course
of
the
next
three
months
.

Go
,
by
all
means
,
my

;
only
put
on
a

always
*NL*
wears
white
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Catherine
cheerfully
complied
,
and
being
properly
equipped
,
was
more
*NL*
impatient
than
ever
to
be
at
the
pump-room
,
that
she
might
inform
*NL*
herself
of
General
Tilney
's
lodgings
,
for
though
she
believed
they
were
*NL*
in
Milsom
Street
,
she
was
not
certain
of
the
house
,
and
Mrs.
Allen
's
*NL*
wavering
convictions
only
made
it
more
doubtful
.
To
Milsom
Street
she
*NL*
was
directed
,
and
having
made
herself
perfect
in
the
number
,
hastened
*NL*
away
with
eager
steps
and
a
beating
heart
to
pay
her
visit
,
explain
her
*NL*
conduct
,
and
be
forgiven
;
tripping
lightly
through
the
church-yard
,
and
*NL*
resolutely
turning
away
her
eyes
,
that
she
might
not
be
obliged
to
*NL*
see
her
beloved
Isabella
and
her
dear
family
,
who
,
she
had
reason
to
*NL*
believe
,
were
in
a
shop
hard
by
.
She
reached
the
house
without
any
*NL*
impediment
,
looked
at
the
number
,
knocked
at
the
door
,
and
inquired
for
*NL*
Miss
Tilney
.
The
man
believed
Miss
Tilney
to
be
at
home
,
but
was
not
*NL*
quite
certain
.
Would
she
be
pleased
to
send
up
her
name
?
She
gave
her
*NL*
card
.
In
a
few
minutes
the
servant
returned
,
and
with
a
look
which
did
*NL*
not
quite
confirm
his
words
,
said
he
had
been
mistaken
,
for
that
Miss
*NL*
Tilney
was
walked
out
.
Catherine
,
with
a
blush
of
mortification
,
left
*NL*
the
house
.
She
felt
almost
persuaded
that
Miss
Tilney
was
at
home
,
and
*NL*
too
much
offended
to
admit
her
;
and
as
she
retired
down
the
street
,
*NL*
could
not
withhold
one
glance
at
the
drawing-room
windows
,
in
*NL*
expectation
of
seeing
her
there
,
but
no
one
appeared
at
them
.
At
the
*NL*
bottom
of
the
street
,
however
,
she
looked
back
again
,
and
then
,
not
at
a
*NL*
window
,
but
issuing
from
the
door
,
she
saw
Miss
Tilney
herself
.
She
was
*NL*
followed
by
a
gentleman
,
whom
Catherine
believed
to
be
her
father
,
*NL*
and
they
turned
up
towards
Edgar
's
Buildings
.
Catherine
,
in
deep
*NL*
mortification
,
proceeded
on
her
way
.
She
could
almost
be
angry
herself
*NL*
at
such
angry
incivility
;
but
she
checked
the
resentful
sensation
;
she
*NL*
remembered
her
own
ignorance
.
She
knew
not
how
such
an
offence
as
hers
*NL*
might
be
classed
by
the
laws
of
worldly
politeness
,
to
what
a
degree
*NL*
of
unforgivingness
it
might
with
propriety
lead
,
nor
to
what
rigours
of
*NL*
rudeness
in
return
it
might
justly
make
her
amenable
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dejected
and
humbled
,
she
had
even
some
thoughts
of
not
going
with
the
*NL*
others
to
the
theatre
that
night
;
but
it
must
be
confessed
that
they
*NL*
were
not
of
long
continuance
,
for
she
soon
recollected
,
in
the
first
*NL*
place
,
that
she
was
without
any
excuse
for
staying
at
home
;
and
,
in
the
*NL*
second
,
that
it
was
a
play
she
wanted
very
much
to
see
.
To
the
theatre
*NL*
accordingly
they
all
went
;
no
Tilneys
appeared
to
plague
or
please
her
;
*NL*
she
feared
that
,
amongst
the
many
perfections
of
the
family
,
a
fondness
*NL*
for
plays
was
not
to
be
ranked
;
but
perhaps
it
was
because
they
were
*NL*
habituated
to
the
finer
performances
of
the
London
stage
,
which
she
*NL*
knew
,
on
Isabella
's
authority
,
rendered
everything
else
of
the
kind
*NL*
``
quite
horrid
.
''
She
was
not
deceived
in
her
own
expectation
of
pleasure
;
*NL*
the
comedy
so
well
suspended
her
care
that
no
one
,
observing
her
during
*NL*
the
first
four
acts
,
would
have
supposed
she
had
any
wretchedness
about
*NL*
her
.
On
the
beginning
of
the
fifth
,
however
,
the
sudden
view
of
Mr.
*NL*
Henry
Tilney
and
his
father
,
joining
a
party
in
the
opposite
box
,
*NL*
recalled
her
to
anxiety
and
distress
.
The
stage
could
no
longer
excite
*NL*
genuine
merriment
--
no
longer
keep
her
whole
attention
.
Every
other
look
*NL*
upon
an
average
was
directed
towards
the
opposite
box
;
and
,
for
the
*NL*
space
of
two
entire
scenes
,
did
she
thus
watch
Henry
Tilney
,
without
*NL*
being
once
able
to
catch
his
eye
.
No
longer
could
he
be
suspected
of
*NL*
indifference
for
a
play
;
his
notice
was
never
withdrawn
from
the
stage
*NL*
during
two
whole
scenes
.
At
length
,
however
,
he
did
look
towards
her
,
*NL*
and
he
bowed
--
but
such
a
bow
!
No
smile
,
no
continued
observance
attended
*NL*
it
;
his
eyes
were
immediately
returned
to
their
former
direction
.
*NL*
Catherine
was
restlessly
miserable
;
she
could
almost
have
run
round
to
*NL*
the
box
in
which
he
sat
and
forced
him
to
hear
her
explanation
.
Feelings
*NL*
rather
natural
than
heroic
possessed
her
;
instead
of
considering
her
*NL*
own
dignity
injured
by
this
ready
condemnation
--
instead
of
proudly
*NL*
resolving
,
in
conscious
innocence
,
to
show
her
resentment
towards
him
*NL*
who
could
harbour
a
doubt
of
it
,
to
leave
to
him
all
the
trouble
*NL*
of
seeking
an
explanation
,
and
to
enlighten
him
on
the
past
only
by
*NL*
avoiding
his
sight
,
or
flirting
with
somebody
else
--
she
took
to
herself
*NL*
all
the
shame
of
misconduct
,
or
at
least
of
its
appearance
,
and
was
only
*NL*
eager
for
an
opportunity
of
explaining
its
cause
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
play
concluded
--
the
curtain
fell
--
Henry
Tilney
was
no
longer
to
be
*NL*
seen
where
he
had
hitherto
sat
,
but
his
father
remained
,
and
perhaps
he
*NL*
might
be
now
coming
round
to
their
box
.
She
was
right
;
in
a
few
minutes
*NL*
he
appeared
,
and
,
making
his
way
through
the
then
thinning
rows
,
spoke
*NL*
with
like
calm
politeness
to
Mrs.
Allen
and
her
friend
.
Not
with
such
*NL*
calmness
was
he
answered
by
the
latter
:
``
Oh
!
Mr.
Tilney
,
I
have
been
*NL*
quite
wild
to
speak
to
you
,
and
make
my
apologies
.
You
must
have
thought
*NL*
me
so
rude
;
but
indeed
it
was
not
my
own
fault
,
was
it
,
Mrs.
Allen
?
*NL*
Did
not
they
tell
me
that
Mr.
Tilney
and
his
sister
were
gone
out
in
a
*NL*
phaeton
together
?
And
then
what
could
I
do
?
But
I
had
ten
thousand
times
*NL*
rather
have
been
with
you
;
now
had
not
I
,
Mrs.
Allen
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
,
you
tumble
my
gown
,
''
was
Mrs.
Allen
's
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
assurance
,
however
,
standing
sole
as
it
did
,
was
not
thrown
away
;
it
*NL*
brought
a
more
cordial
,
more
natural
smile
into
his
countenance
,
and
*NL*
he
replied
in
a
tone
which
retained
only
a
little
affected
reserve
:
*NL*
``
We
were
much
obliged
to
you
at
any
rate
for
wishing
us
a
pleasant
walk
*NL*
after
our
passing
you
in
Argyle
Street
:
you
were
so
kind
as
to
look
back
*NL*
on
purpose
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
indeed
I
did
not
wish
you
a
pleasant
walk
;
I
never
thought
of
such
*NL*
a
thing
;
but
I
begged
Mr.
Thorpe
so
earnestly
to
stop
;
I
called
out
to
*NL*
him
as
soon
as
ever
I
saw
you
;
now
,
Mrs.
Allen
,
did
not
--
Oh
!
You
were
*NL*
not
there
;
but
indeed
I
did
;
and
,
if
Mr.
Thorpe
would
only
have
stopped
,
*NL*
I
would
have
jumped
out
and
run
after
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Is
there
a
Henry
in
the
world
who
could
be
insensible
to
such
a
*NL*
declaration
?
Henry
Tilney
at
least
was
not
.
With
a
yet
sweeter
smile
,
he
*NL*
said
everything
that
need
be
said
of
his
sister
's
concern
,
regret
,
and
*NL*
dependence
on
Catherine
's
honour
.
``
Oh
!
Do
not
say
Miss
Tilney
was
not
*NL*
angry
,
''
cried
Catherine
,
``
because
I
know
she
was
;
for
she
would
not
see
*NL*
me
this
morning
when
I
called
;
I
saw
her
walk
out
of
the
house
the
next
*NL*
minute
after
my
leaving
it
;
I
was
hurt
,
but
I
was
not
affronted
.
Perhaps
*NL*
you
did
not
know
I
had
been
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
not
within
at
the
time
;
but
I
heard
of
it
from
Eleanor
,
and
she
*NL*
has
been
wishing
ever
since
to
see
you
,
to
explain
the
reason
of
such
*NL*
incivility
;
but
perhaps
I
can
do
it
as
well
.
It
was
nothing
more
than
*NL*
that
my
father
--
they
were
just
preparing
to
walk
out
,
and
he
being
*NL*
hurried
for
time
,
and
not
caring
to
have
it
put
off
--
made
a
point
of
her
*NL*
being
denied
.
That
was
all
,
I
do
assure
you
.
She
was
very
much
vexed
,
*NL*
and
meant
to
make
her
apology
as
soon
as
possible
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Catherine
's
mind
was
greatly
eased
by
this
information
,
yet
a
something
*NL*
of
solicitude
remained
,
from
which
sprang
the
following
question
,
*NL*
thoroughly
artless
in
itself
,
though
rather
distressing
to
the
*NL*
gentleman
:
``
But
,
Mr.
Tilney
,
why
were
you
less
generous
than
your
*NL*
sister
?
If
she
felt
such
confidence
in
my
good
intentions
,
and
could
*NL*
suppose
it
to
be
only
a
mistake
,
why
should
you
be
so
ready
to
take
*NL*
offence
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Me
!
I
take
offence
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
I
am
sure
by
your
look
,
when
you
came
into
the
box
,
you
were
*NL*
angry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
angry
!
I
could
have
no
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
nobody
would
have
thought
you
had
no
right
who
saw
your
face
.
''
He
*NL*
replied
by
asking
her
to
make
room
for
him
,
and
talking
of
the
play
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
remained
with
them
some
time
,
and
was
only
too
agreeable
for
*NL*
Catherine
to
be
contented
when
he
went
away
.
Before
they
parted
,
*NL*
however
,
it
was
agreed
that
the
projected
walk
should
be
taken
as
soon
*NL*
as
possible
;
and
,
setting
aside
the
misery
of
his
quitting
their
box
,
*NL*
she
was
,
upon
the
whole
,
left
one
of
the
happiest
creatures
in
the
*NL*
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
talking
to
each
other
,
she
had
observed
with
some
surprise
that
*NL*
John
Thorpe
,
who
was
never
in
the
same
part
of
the
house
for
ten
minutes
*NL*
together
,
was
engaged
in
conversation
with
General
Tilney
;
and
she
felt
*NL*
something
more
than
surprise
when
she
thought
she
could
perceive
herself
*NL*
the
object
of
their
attention
and
discourse
.
What
could
they
have
to
say
*NL*
of
her
?
She
feared
General
Tilney
did
not
like
her
appearance
:
she
found
*NL*
it
was
implied
in
his
preventing
her
admittance
to
his
daughter
,
rather
*NL*
than
postpone
his
own
walk
a
few
minutes
.
``
How
came
Mr.
Thorpe
to
know
*NL*
your
father
?
''
was
her
anxious
inquiry
,
as
she
pointed
them
out
to
her
*NL*
companion
.
He
knew
nothing
about
it
;
but
his
father
,
like
every
military
*NL*
man
,
had
a
very
large
acquaintance
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
entertainment
was
over
,
Thorpe
came
to
assist
them
in
getting
*NL*
out
.
Catherine
was
the
immediate
object
of
his
gallantry
;
and
,
while
*NL*
they
waited
in
the
lobby
for
a
chair
,
he
prevented
the
inquiry
which
had
*NL*
travelled
from
her
heart
almost
to
the
tip
of
her
tongue
,
by
asking
,
in
*NL*
a
consequential
manner
,
whether
she
had
seen
him
talking
with
General
*NL*
Tilney
:
``
He
is
a
fine
old
fellow
,
upon
my
soul
!
Stout
,
active
--
looks
*NL*
as
young
as
his
son
.
I
have
a
great
regard
for
him
,
I
assure
you
:
a
*NL*
gentleman-like
,
good
sort
of
fellow
as
ever
lived
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
how
came
you
to
know
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Know
him
!
There
are
few
people
much
about
town
that
I
do
not
know
.
I
*NL*
have
met
him
forever
at
the
Bedford
;
and
I
knew
his
face
again
today
the
*NL*
moment
he
came
into
the
billiard-room
.
One
of
the
best
players
we
have
,
*NL*
by
the
by
;
and
we
had
a
little
touch
together
,
though
I
was
almost
*NL*
afraid
of
him
at
first
:
the
odds
were
five
to
four
against
me
;
and
,
if
*NL*
I
had
not
made
one
of
the
cleanest
strokes
that
perhaps
ever
was
made
in
*NL*
this
world
--
I
took
his
ball
exactly
--
but
I
could
not
make
you
understand
*NL*
it
without
a
table
;
however
,
I
did
beat
him
.
A
very
fine
fellow
;
as
rich
*NL*
as
a
Jew
.
I
should
like
to
dine
with
him
;
I
dare
say
he
gives
famous
*NL*
dinners
.
But
what
do
you
think
we
have
been
talking
of
?
You
.
Yes
,
by
*NL*
heavens
!
And
the
general
thinks
you
the
finest
girl
in
Bath
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
Nonsense
!
How
can
you
say
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
do
you
think
I
said
?
''
--
lowering
his
voice
--
``
well
done
,
*NL*
general
,
said
I
;
I
am
quite
of
your
mind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
Catherine
,
who
was
much
less
gratified
by
his
admiration
than
by
*NL*
General
Tilney
's
,
was
not
sorry
to
be
called
away
by
Mr.
Allen
.
Thorpe
,
*NL*
however
,
would
see
her
to
her
chair
,
and
,
till
she
entered
it
,
continued
*NL*
the
same
kind
of
delicate
flattery
,
in
spite
of
her
entreating
him
to
*NL*
have
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
General
Tilney
,
instead
of
disliking
,
should
admire
her
,
was
very
*NL*
delightful
;
and
she
joyfully
thought
that
there
was
not
one
of
the
*NL*
family
whom
she
need
now
fear
to
meet
.
The
evening
had
done
more
,
much
*NL*
more
,
for
her
than
could
have
been
expected

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Monday
,
Tuesday
,
Wednesday
,
Thursday
,
Friday
,
and
Saturday
have
now
*NL*
passed
in
review
before
the
reader
;
the
events
of
each
day
,
its
hopes
*NL*
and
fears
,
mortifications
and
pleasures
,
have
been
separately
stated
,
*NL*
and
the
pangs
of
Sunday
only
now
remain
to
be
described
,
and
close
the
*NL*
week
.
The
Clifton
scheme
had
been
deferred
,
not
relinquished
,
and
on
*NL*
the
afternoon
's
Crescent
of
this
day
,
it
was
brought
forward
again
.
In
a
*NL*
private
consultation
between
Isabella
and
James
,
the
former
of
whom
had
*NL*
particularly
set
her
heart
upon
going
,
and
the
latter
no
less
anxiously
*NL*
placed
his
upon
pleasing
her
,
it
was
agreed
that
,
provided
the
weather
*NL*
were
fair
,
the
party
should
take
place
on
the
following
morning
;
and
*NL*
they
were
to
set
off
very
early
,
in
order
to
be
at
home
in
good
time
.
*NL*
The
affair
thus
determined
,
and
Thorpe
's
approbation
secured
,
Catherine
*NL*
only
remained
to
be
apprised
of
it
.
She
had
left
them
for
a
few
minutes
*NL*
to
speak
to
Miss
Tilney
.
In
that
interval
the
plan
was
completed
,
and
as
*NL*
soon
as
she
came
again
,
her
agreement
was
demanded
;
but
instead
of
the
*NL*
gay
acquiescence
expected
by
Isabella
,
Catherine
looked
grave
,
was
very
*NL*
sorry
,
but
could
not
go
.
The
engagement
which
ought
to
have
kept
her
*NL*
from
joining
in
the
former
attempt
would
make
it
impossible
for
her
to
*NL*
accompany
them
now
.
She
had
that
moment
settled
with
Miss
Tilney
to
take
*NL*
their
proposed
walk
tomorrow
;
it
was
quite
determined
,
and
she
would
*NL*
not
,
upon
any
account
,
retract
.
But
that
she
must
and
should
retract
*NL*
was
instantly
the
eager
cry
of
both
the
Thorpes
;
they
must
go
to
Clifton
*NL*
tomorrow
,
they
would
not
go
without
her
,
it
would
be
nothing
to
put
off
*NL*
a
mere
walk
for
one
day
longer
,
and
they
would
not
hear
of
a
refusal
.
*NL*
Catherine
was
distressed
,
but
not
subdued
.
``
Do
not
urge
me
,
Isabella
.
I
*NL*
am
engaged
to
Miss
Tilney
.
I
can
not
go
.
''
This
availed
nothing
.
The
same
*NL*
arguments
assailed
her
again
;
she
must
go
,
she
should
go
,
and
they
would
*NL*
not
hear
of
a
refusal
.
``
It
would
be
so
easy
to
tell
Miss
Tilney
that
you
*NL*
had
just
been
reminded
of
a
prior
engagement
,
and
must
only
beg
to
put
*NL*
off
the
walk
till
Tuesday
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
it
would
not
be
easy
.
I
could
not
do
it
.
There
has
been
no
prior
*NL*
engagement
.
''
But
Isabella
became
only
more
and
more
urgent
,
calling
*NL*
on
her
in
the
most
affectionate
manner
,
addressing
her
by
the
most
*NL*
endearing
names
.
She
was
sure
her
dearest
,
sweetest
Catherine
would
not
*NL*
seriously
refuse
such
a
trifling
request
to
a
friend
who
loved
her
so
*NL*
dearly
.
She
knew
her
beloved
Catherine
to
have
so
feeling
a
heart
,
so
*NL*
sweet
a
temper
,
to
be
so
easily
persuaded
by
those
she
loved
.
But
all
*NL*
in
vain
;
Catherine
felt
herself
to
be
in
the
right
,
and
though
pained
*NL*
by
such
tender
,
such
flattering
supplication
,
could
not
allow
it
to
*NL*
influence
her
.
Isabella
then
tried
another
method
.
She
reproached
her
*NL*
with
having
more
affection
for
Miss
Tilney
,
though
she
had
known
her
so
*NL*
little
a
while
,
than
for
her
best
and
oldest
friends
,
with
being
grown
*NL*
cold
and
indifferent
,
in
short
,
towards
herself
.
``
I
can
not
help
being
*NL*
jealous
,
Catherine
,
when
I
see
myself
slighted
for
strangers
,
I
,
who
*NL*
love
you
so
excessively
!
When
once
my
affections
are
placed
,
it
is
not
*NL*
in
the
power
of
anything
to
change
them
.
But
I
believe
my
feelings
are
*NL*
stronger
than
anybody
's
;
I
am
sure
they
are
too
strong
for
my
own
peace
;
*NL*
and
to
see
myself
supplanted
in
your
friendship
by
strangers
does
cut
me
*NL*
to
the
quick
,
I
own
.
These
Tilneys
seem
to
swallow
up
everything
else
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Catherine
thought
this
reproach
equally
strange
and
unkind
.
Was
it
the
*NL*
part
of
a
friend
thus
to
expose
her
feelings
to
the
notice
of
others
?
*NL*
Isabella
appeared
to
her
ungenerous
and
selfish
,
regardless
of
*NL*
everything
but
her
own
gratification
.
These
painful
ideas
crossed
her
*NL*
mind
,
though
she
said
nothing
.
Isabella
,
in
the
meanwhile
,
had
applied
*NL*
her
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
;
and
Morland
,
miserable
at
such
a
sight
,
*NL*
could
not
help
saying
,
``
Nay
,
Catherine
.
I
think
you
can
not
stand
out
any
*NL*
longer
now
.
The
sacrifice
is
not
much
;
and
to
oblige
such
a
friend
--
I
*NL*
shall
think
you
quite
unkind
,
if
you
still
refuse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
first
time
of
her
brother
's
openly
siding
against
her
,
and
*NL*
anxious
to
avoid
his
displeasure
,
she
proposed
a
compromise
.
If
they
*NL*
would
only
put
off
their
scheme
till
Tuesday
,
which
they
might
easily
*NL*
do
,
as
it
depended
only
on
themselves
,
she
could
go
with
them
,
and
*NL*
everybody
might
then
be
satisfied
.
But
``
No
,
no
,
no
!
''
was
the
immediate
*NL*
answer
;
``
that
could
not
be
,
for
Thorpe
did
not
know
that
he
might
not
*NL*
go
to
town
on
Tuesday
.
''
Catherine
was
sorry
,
but
could
do
no
more
;
and
*NL*
a
short
silence
ensued
,
which
was
broken
by
Isabella
,
who
in
a
voice
of
*NL*
cold
resentment
said
,
``
Very
well
,
then
there
is
an
end
of
the
party
.
*NL*
If
Catherine
does
not
go
,
I
can
not
.
I
can
not
be
the
only
woman
.
I
would
*NL*
not
,
upon
any
account
in
the
world
,
do
so
improper
a
thing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Catherine
,
you
must
go
,
''
said
James
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why
can
not
Mr.
Thorpe
drive
one
of
his
other
sisters
?
I
dare
say
*NL*
either
of
them
would
like
to
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
ye
,
''
cried
Thorpe
,
``
but
I
did
not
come
to
Bath
to
drive
my
*NL*
sisters
about
,
and
look
like
a
fool
.
No
,
if
you
do
not
go
,
d
--
me
if
I
*NL*
do
.
I
only
go
for
the
sake
of
driving
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
a
compliment
which
gives
me
no
pleasure
.
''
But
her
words
were
*NL*
lost
on
Thorpe
,
who
had
turned
abruptly
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
three
others
still
continued
together
,
walking
in
a
most
*NL*
uncomfortable
manner
to
poor
Catherine
;
sometimes
not
a
word
was
said
,
*NL*
sometimes
she
was
again
attacked
with
supplications
or
reproaches
,
and
*NL*
her
arm
was
still
linked
within
Isabella
's
,
though
their
hearts
were
*NL*
at
war
.
At
one
moment
she
was
softened
,
at
another
irritated
;
always
*NL*
distressed
,
but
always
steady
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
not
think
you
had
been
so
obstinate
,
Catherine
,
''
said
James
;
*NL*
``
you
were
not
used
to
be
so
hard
to
persuade
;
you
once
were
the
kindest
,
*NL*
best-tempered
of
my
sisters
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
I
am
not
less
so
now
,
''
she
replied
,
very
feelingly
;
``
but
indeed
*NL*
I
can
not
go
.
If
I
am
wrong
,
I
am
doing
what
I
believe
to
be
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suspect
,
''
said
Isabella
,
in
a
low
voice
,
``
there
is
no
great
*NL*
struggle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Catherine
's
heart
swelled
;
she
drew
away
her
arm
,
and
Isabella
made
no
*NL*
opposition
.
Thus
passed
a
long
ten
minutes
,
till
they
were
again
joined
*NL*
by
Thorpe
,
who
,
coming
to
them
with
a
gayer
look
,
said
,
``
Well
,
I
*NL*
have
settled
the
matter
,
and
now
we
may
all
go
tomorrow
with
a
safe
*NL*
conscience
.
I
have
been
to
Miss
Tilney
,
and
made
your
excuses
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
not
!
''
cried
Catherine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
,
upon
my
soul
.
Left
her
this
moment
.
Told
her
you
had
sent
me
to
*NL*
say
that
,
having
just
recollected
a
prior
engagement
of
going
to
Clifton
*NL*
with
us
tomorrow
,
you
could
not
have
the
pleasure
of
walking
with
her
*NL*
till
Tuesday
.
She
said
very
well
,
Tuesday
was
just
as
convenient
to
her
;
*NL*
so
there
is
an
end
of
all
our
difficulties
.
A
pretty
good
thought
of
*NL*
mine
--
hey
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabella
's
countenance
was
once
more
all
smiles
and
good
humour
,
and
*NL*
James
too
looked
happy
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
most
heavenly
thought
indeed
!
Now
,
my
sweet
Catherine
,
all
our
*NL*
distresses
are
over
;
you
are
honourably
acquitted
,
and
we
shall
have
a
*NL*
most
delightful
party
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
will
not
do
,
''
said
Catherine
;
``
I
can
not
submit
to
this
.
I
must
run
*NL*
after
Miss
Tilney
directly
and
set
her
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabella
,
however
,
caught
hold
of
one
hand
,
Thorpe
of
the
other
,
and
*NL*
remonstrances
poured
in
from
all
three
.
Even
James
was
quite
angry
.
When
*NL*
everything
was
settled
,
when
Miss
Tilney
herself
said
that
Tuesday
would
*NL*
suit
her
as
well
,
it
was
quite
ridiculous
,
quite
absurd
,
to
make
any
*NL*
further
objection
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
care
.
Mr.
Thorpe
had
no
business
to
invent
any
such
message
.
*NL*
If
I
had
thought
it
right
to
put
it
off
,
I
could
have
spoken
to
Miss
*NL*
Tilney
myself
.
This
is
only
doing
it
in
a
ruder
way
;
and
how
do
I
know
*NL*
that
Mr.
Thorpe
has
--
He
may
be
mistaken
again
perhaps
;
he
led
me
into
*NL*
one
act
of
rudeness
by
his
mistake
on
Friday
.
Let
me
go
,
Mr.
Thorpe
;
*NL*
Isabella
,
do
not
hold
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thorpe
told
her
it
would
be
in
vain
to
go
after
the
Tilneys
;
they
were
*NL*
turning
the
corner
into
Brock
Street
,
when
he
had
overtaken
them
,
and
*NL*
were
at
home
by
this
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
will
go
after
them
,
''
said
Catherine
;
``
wherever
they
are
I
will
*NL*
go
after
them
.
It
does
not
signify
talking
.
If
I
could
not
be
persuaded
*NL*
into
doing
what
I
thought
wrong
,
I
never
will
be
tricked
into
it
.
''
*NL*
And
with
these
words
she
broke
away
and
hurried
off
.
Thorpe
would
have
*NL*
darted
after
her
,
but
Morland
withheld
him
.
``
Let
her
go
,
let
her
go
,
if
*NL*
she
will
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
as
obstinate
as
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thorpe
never
finished
the
simile
,
for
it
could
hardly
have
been
a
proper
*NL*
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
Away
walked
Catherine
in
great
agitation
,
as
fast
as
the
crowd
would
*NL*
permit
her
,
fearful
of
being
pursued
,
yet
determined
to
persevere
.
As
*NL*
she
walked
,
she
reflected
on
what
had
passed
.
It
was
painful
to
her
to
*NL*
disappoint
and
displease
them
,
particularly
to
displease
her
brother
;
*NL*
but
she
could
not
repent
her
resistance
.
Setting
her
own
inclination
*NL*
apart
,
to
have
failed
a
second
time
in
her
engagement
to
Miss
Tilney
,
to
*NL*
have
retracted
a
promise
voluntarily
made
only
five
minutes
before
,
*NL*
and
on
a
false
pretence
too
,
must
have
been
wrong
.
She
had
not
been
*NL*
withstanding
them
on
selfish
principles
alone
,
she
had
not
consulted
*NL*
merely
her
own
gratification
;
that
might
have
been
ensured
in
some
*NL*
degree
by
the
excursion
itself
,
by
seeing
Blaize
Castle
;
no
,
she
had
*NL*
attended
to
what
was
due
to
others
,
and
to
her
own
character
in
their
*NL*
opinion
.
Her
conviction
of
being
right
,
however
,
was
not
enough
to
*NL*
restore
her
composure
;
till
she
had
spoken
to
Miss
Tilney
she
could
not
*NL*
be
at
ease
;
and
quickening
her
pace
when
she
got
clear
of
the
Crescent
,
*NL*
she
almost
ran
over
the
remaining
ground
till
she
gained
the
top
of
*NL*
Milsom
Street
.
So
rapid
had
been
her
movements
that
in
spite
of
the
*NL*
Tilneys
'
advantage
in
the
outset
,
they
were
but
just
turning
into
*NL*
their
lodgings
as
she
came
within
view
of
them
;
and
the
servant
still
*NL*
remaining
at
the
open
door
,
she
used
only
the
ceremony
of
saying
*NL*
that
she
must
speak
with
Miss
Tilney
that
moment
,
and
hurrying
by
him
*NL*
proceeded
upstairs
.
Then
,
opening
the
first
door
before
her
,
which
*NL*
happened
to
be
the
right
,
she
immediately
found
herself
in
the
*NL*
drawing-room
with
General
Tilney
,
his
son
,
and
daughter
.
Her
*NL*
explanation
,
defective
only
in
being
--
from
her
irritation
of
nerves
and
*NL*
shortness
of
breath
--
no
explanation
at
all
,
was
instantly
given
.
``
I
am
*NL*
come
in
a
great
hurry
--
It
was
all
a
mistake
--
I
never
promised
to
go
--
I
*NL*
told
them
from
the
first
I
could
not
go
.
--
I
ran
away
in
a
great
hurry
*NL*
to
explain
it
.
--
I
did
not
care
what
you
thought
of
me
.
--
I
would
not
stay
*NL*
for
the
servant
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
business
,
however
,
though
not
perfectly
elucidated
by
this
speech
,
*NL*
soon
ceased
to
be
a
puzzle
.
Catherine
found
that
John
Thorpe
had
given
*NL*
the
message
;
and
Miss
Tilney
had
no
scruple
in
owning
herself
greatly
*NL*
surprised
by
it
.
But
whether
her
brother
had
still
exceeded
her
in
*NL*
resentment
,
Catherine
,
though
she
instinctively
addressed
herself
as
*NL*
much
to
one
as
to
the
other
in
her
vindication
,
had
no
means
of
knowing
.
*NL*
Whatever
might
have
been
felt
before
her
arrival
,
her
eager
declarations
*NL*
immediately
made
every
look
and
sentence
as
friendly
as
she
could
*NL*
desire
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
affair
thus
happily
settled
,
she
was
introduced
by
Miss
Tilney
*NL*
to
her
father
,
and
received
by
him
with
such
ready
,
such
solicitous
*NL*
politeness
as
recalled
Thorpe
's
information
to
her
mind
,
and
made
her
*NL*
think
with
pleasure
that
he
might
be
sometimes
depended
on
.
To
such
*NL*
anxious
attention
was
the
general
's
civility
carried
,
that
not
aware
of
*NL*
her
extraordinary
swiftness
in
entering
the
house
,
he
was
quite
angry
*NL*
with
the
servant
whose
neglect
had
reduced
her
to
open
the
door
of
the
*NL*
apartment
herself
.
``
What
did
William
mean
by
it
?
He
should
make
a
point
*NL*
of
inquiring
into
the
matter
.
''
And
if
Catherine
had
not
most
warmly
*NL*
asserted
his
innocence
,
it
seemed
likely
that
William
would
lose
the
*NL*
favour
of
his
master
forever
,
if
not
his
place
,
by
her
rapidity
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
sitting
with
them
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
she
rose
to
take
leave
,
*NL*
and
was
then
most
agreeably
surprised
by
General
Tilney
's
asking
her
if
*NL*
she
would
do
his
daughter
the
honour
of
dining
and
spending
the
rest
*NL*
of
the
day
with
her
.
Miss
Tilney
added
her
own
wishes
.
Catherine
was
*NL*
greatly
obliged
;
but
it
was
quite
out
of
her
power
.
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Allen
*NL*
would
expect
her
back
every
moment
.
The
general
declared
he
could
say
no
*NL*
more
;
the
claims
of
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Allen
were
not
to
be
superseded
;
but
on
*NL*
some
other
day
he
trusted
,
when
longer
notice
could
be
given
,
they
would
*NL*
not
refuse
to
spare
her
to
her
friend
.
``
Oh
,
no
;
Catherine
was
sure
they
*NL*
would
not
have
the
least
objection
,
and
she
should
have
great
pleasure
*NL*
in
coming
.
''
The
general
attended
her
himself
to
the
street-door
,
saying
*NL*
everything
gallant
as
they
went
downstairs
,
admiring
the
elasticity
of
*NL*
her
walk
,
which
corresponded
exactly
with
the
spirit
of
her
dancing
,
and
*NL*
making
her
one
of
the
most
graceful
bows
she
had
ever
beheld
,
when
they
*NL*
parted
.
*NL*
*NL*
Catherine
,
delighted
by
all
that
had
passed
,
proceeded
gaily
to
Pulteney
*NL*
Street
,
walking
,
as
she
concluded
,
with
great
elasticity
,
though
she
*NL*
had
never
thought
of
it
before
.
She
reached
home
without
seeing
anything
*NL*
more
of
the
offended
party
;
and
now
that
she
had
been
triumphant
*NL*
throughout
,
had
carried
her
point
,
and
was
secure
of
her
walk
,
she
began
*NL*
-LRB-
as
the
flutter
of
her
spirits
subsided
-RRB-
to
doubt
whether
she
had
been
*NL*
perfectly
right
.
A
sacrifice
was
always
noble
;
and
if
she
had
given
way
*NL*
to
their
entreaties
,
she
should
have
been
spared
the
distressing
idea
of
*NL*
a
friend
displeased
,
a
brother
angry
,
and
a
scheme
of
great
happiness
*NL*
to
both
destroyed
,
perhaps
through
her
means
.
To
ease
her
mind
,
and
*NL*
ascertain
by
the
opinion
of
an
unprejudiced
person
what
her
own
conduct
*NL*
had
really
been
,
she
took
occasion
to
mention
before
Mr.
Allen
the
*NL*
half-settled
scheme
of
her
brother
and
the
Thorpes
for
the
following
*NL*
day
.
Mr.
Allen
caught
at
it
directly
.
``
Well
,
''
said
he
,
``
and
do
you
think
*NL*
of
going
too
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
I
had
just
engaged
myself
to
walk
with
Miss
Tilney
before
they
told
*NL*
me
of
it
;
and
therefore
you
know
I
could
not
go
with
them
,
could
I
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
certainly
not
;
and
I
am
glad
you
do
not
think
of
it
.
These
schemes
*NL*
are
not
at
all
the
thing
.
Young
men
and
women
driving
about
the
country
*NL*
in
open
carriages
!
Now
and
then
it
is
very
well
;
but
going
to
inns
and
*NL*
public
places
together
!
It
is
not
right
;
and
I
wonder
Mrs.
Thorpe
should
*NL*
allow
it
.
I
am
glad
you
do
not
think
of
going
;
I
am
sure
Mrs.
Morland
*NL*
would
not
be
pleased
.
Mrs.
Allen
,
are
not
you
of
my
way
of
thinking
?
Do
*NL*
not
you
think
these
kind
of
projects
objectionable
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
very
much
so
indeed
.
Open
carriages
are
nasty
things
.
A
clean
*NL*
gown
is
not
five
minutes
'
wear
in
them
.
You
are
splashed
getting
in
*NL*
and
getting
out
;
and
the
wind
takes
your
hair
and
your
bonnet
in
every
*NL*
direction
.
I
hate
an
open
carriage
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
you
do
;
but
that
is
not
the
question
.
Do
not
you
think
it
has
an
*NL*
odd
appearance
,
if
young
ladies
are
frequently
driven
about
in
them
by
*NL*
young
men
,
to
whom
they
are
not
even
related
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
my
dear
,
a
very
odd
appearance
indeed
.
I
can
not
bear
to
see
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
madam
,
''
cried
Catherine
,
``
then
why
did
not
you
tell
me
so
before
?
*NL*
I
am
sure
if
I
had
known
it
to
be
improper
,
I
would
not
have
gone
with
*NL*
Mr.
Thorpe
at
all
;
but
I
always
hoped
you
would
tell
me
,
if
you
thought
*NL*
I
was
doing
wrong
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
so
I
should
,
my
dear

you
may
depend
on
it
;
for
as
I
told
Mrs.
*NL*
Morland
at
parting
,
I
would
always
do
the
best
for
you
in
my
power
.
But
*NL*
one
must
not
be
over
particular
.
Young
people
will
be
young
people
,
*NL*
as
your
good
mother
says
herself
.
You
know
I
wanted
you
,
when
we
first
*NL*
came
,
not
to
buy
that
sprigged
muslin
,
but
you
would
.
Young
people
do
*NL*
not
like
to
be
always
thwarted
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
this
was
something
of
real
consequence
;
and
I
do
not
think
you
*NL*
would
have
found
me
hard
to
persuade
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
far
as
it
has
gone
hitherto
,
there
is
no
harm
done
,
''
said
Mr.
Allen
;
*NL*
``
and
I
would
only
advise
you
,
my
dear
,
not
to
go
out
with
Mr.
Thorpe
any
*NL*
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
just
what
I
was
going
to
say
,
''
added
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
Catherine
,
relieved
for
herself
,
felt
uneasy
for
Isabella
,
and
after
a
*NL*
moment
's
thought
,
asked
Mr.
Allen
whether
it
would
not
be
both
proper
*NL*
and
kind
in
her
to
write
to
Miss
Thorpe
,
and
explain
the
indecorum
of
*NL*
which
she
must
be
as
insensible
as
herself
;
for
she
considered
that
*NL*
Isabella
might
otherwise
perhaps
be
going
to
Clifton
the
next
day
,
in
*NL*
spite
of
what
had
passed
.
Mr.
Allen
,
however
,
discouraged
her
from
doing
*NL*
any
such
thing
.
``
You
had
better
leave
her
alone
,
my
dear
;
she
is
old
*NL*
enough
to
know
what
she
is
about
,
and
if
not
,
has
a
mother
to
advise
*NL*
her
.
Mrs.
Thorpe
is
too
indulgent
beyond
a
doubt
;
but
,
however
,
you
had
*NL*
better
not
interfere
.
She
and
your
brother
choose
to
go
,
and
you
will
be
*NL*
only
getting
ill
will
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Catherine
submitted
,
and
though
sorry
to
think
that
Isabella
should
be
*NL*
doing
wrong
,
felt
greatly
relieved
by
Mr.
Allen
's
approbation
of
her
*NL*
own
conduct
,
and
truly
rejoiced
to
be
preserved
by
his
advice
from
the
*NL*
danger
of
falling
into
such
an
error
herself
.
Her
escape
from
being
one
*NL*
of
the
party
to
Clifton
was
now
an
escape
indeed
;
for
what
would
the
*NL*
Tilneys
have
thought
of
her
,
if
she
had
broken
her
promise
to
them
in
*NL*
order
to
do
what
was
wrong
in
itself
,
if
she
had
been
guilty
of
one
*NL*
breach
of
propriety
,
only
to
enable
her
to
be
guilty
of
another

CHAPTER
14
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
morning
was
fair
,
and
Catherine
almost
expected
another
attack
*NL*
from
the
assembled
party
.
With
Mr.
Allen
to
support
her
,
she
felt
no
*NL*
dread
of
the
event
:
but
she
would
gladly
be
spared
a
contest
,
where
*NL*
victory
itself
was
painful
,
and
was
heartily
rejoiced
therefore
at
*NL*
neither
seeing
nor
hearing
anything
of
them
.
The
Tilneys
called
for
*NL*
her
at
the
appointed
time
;
and
no
new
difficulty
arising
,
no
sudden
*NL*
recollection
,
no
unexpected
summons
,
no
impertinent
intrusion
to
*NL*
disconcert
their
measures
,
my
heroine
was
most
unnaturally
able
to
*NL*
fulfil
her
engagement
,
though
it
was
made
with
the
hero
himself
.
*NL*
They
determined
on
walking
round
Beechen
Cliff
,
that
noble
hill
whose
*NL*
beautiful
verdure
and
hanging
coppice
render
it
so
striking
an
object
*NL*
from
almost
every
opening
in
Bath
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
look
at
it
,
''
said
Catherine
,
as
they
walked
along
the
side
of
*NL*
the
river
,
``
without
thinking
of
the
south
of
France
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
been
abroad
then
?
''
said
Henry
,
a
little
surprised
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
No
,
I
only
mean
what
I
have
read
about
.
It
always
puts
me
in
mind
*NL*
of
the
country
that
Emily
and
her
father
travelled
through
,
in
The
*NL*
Mysteries
of
Udolpho
.
But
you
never
read
novels
,
I
dare
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
they
are
not
clever
enough
for
you
--
gentlemen
read
better
*NL*
books
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
The
person
,
be
it
gentleman
or
lady
,
who
has
not
pleasure
in
a
good
*NL*
novel

must
be
intolerably
stupid

I
have
read
all
Mrs.
Radcliffe
's
*NL*
works
,
and
most
of
them
with
great
pleasure
.
The
Mysteries
of
Udolpho
,
*NL*
when
I
had
once
begun
it
,
I
could
not
lay
down
again
;
I
remember
*NL*
finishing
it
in
two
days
--
my
hair
standing
on
end
the
whole
time
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
added
Miss
Tilney
,
``
and
I
remember
that
you
undertook
to
read
it
*NL*
aloud
to
me
,
and
that
when
I
was
called
away
for
only
five
minutes
to
*NL*
answer
a
note
,
instead
of
waiting
for
me
,
you
took
the
volume
into
the
*NL*
Hermitage
Walk
,
and
I
was
obliged
to
stay
till
you
had
finished
it
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you

Eleanor
--
a
most
honourable
testimony

You
see
,
Miss
Morland

*NL*
the
injustice

your
suspicions

Here
was
I
,
in
my
eagerness

get
on

*NL*
refusing
to
wait
only
five
minutes
for
my
sister

breaking
the
promise

I
had
made
of

it
aloud

keeping
her
in
suspense

a
most
*NL*
interesting
part

by
running
away
with
the
volume
,
which
,
you
are
to
*NL*
observe

was
her
own
,
particularly
her
own
.
I
am
proud
when
I
reflect
on
*NL*
it

must
establish
me
in
your
good

very
glad

I
really
thought
before

young
men
despised
*NL*
novels
amazingly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
amazingly
;
it
may
well
suggest
amazement
if
they
do

for
they
*NL*
read
nearly
as
many

I
myself
have
read
hundreds

hundreds

*NL*
Do
not
imagine
that
you
can
cope
with
me
in
a
knowledge
of
Julias

Louisas

If

never-ceasing

left

went
with

Consider
how
many

Not

book
in
the
world

*NL*
*NL*
``

Miss
Morland
,
let
us
leave
him
to
meditate
over
our
faults
in
the
utmost
*NL*
propriety
of
diction
,
while
we
praise
Udolpho
in
whatever
terms
we
*NL*
like
best
.
It
is
a
most
interesting
work
.
You
are
fond
of
that
kind
of
*NL*
reading

*NL*
*NL*
``
To
say
the

I
do
not

*NL*
``
Indeed

*NL*
*NL*

That
is
,
I
can
read
poetry
and
plays

and
things
of
that
sort
,
and
*NL*
do
not
dislike
travels
.
But
history
,
real
solemn
history
,
I
can
not
be
*NL*
interested
in
.
Can
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
am
fond
of
history

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
I
were
too
.
I
read
it
a
little
as
a
duty
,
but
it
tells
me
*NL*
nothing
that
does
not
either
vex
or
weary
me
.
The
quarrels
of
popes
and
*NL*
kings
,
with
wars
or
pestilences
,
in
every
page
;
the
men
all
so
good
for
*NL*
nothing
,
and
hardly
any
women
at
all
--
it
is
very
tiresome
:
and
yet
I
*NL*
often
think
it
odd
that
it
should
be
so
dull
,
for
a
great
deal
of
it
*NL*
must
be
invention
.
The
speeches
that
are
put
into
the
heroes
'
mouths
,
*NL*
their
thoughts
and
designs
--
the
chief
of
all
this
must
be
invention
,
and
*NL*
invention
is
what
delights
me
in
other
books
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Historians
,
you
think
,
''
said
Miss
Tilney
,
``
are
not
happy
in
their
*NL*
flights
of
fancy
.
They
display
imagination
without
raising
interest
.
I
*NL*
am
fond
of
history
--
and
am
very
well
contented
to
take
the
false
with
*NL*
the
true
.
In
the
principal
facts
they
have
sources
of
intelligence
*NL*
in
former
histories
and
records
,
which
may
be
as
much
depended
on
,
*NL*
I
conclude
,
as
anything
that
does
not
actually
pass
under
one
's
own
*NL*
observation
;
and
as
for
the
little
embellishments
you
speak
of
,
they
are
*NL*
embellishments
,
and
I
like
them
as
such
.
If
a
speech
be
well
drawn
up
,
*NL*
I
read
it
with
pleasure
,
by
whomsoever
it
may
be
made
--
and
probably
with
*NL*
much
greater
,
if
the
production
of
Mr.
Hume
or
Mr.
Robertson
,
than
if
*NL*
the
genuine
words
of
Caractacus
,
Agricola
,
or
Alfred
the
Great
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
fond
of
history
!
And
so
are
Mr.
Allen
and
my
father
;
and
I
have
*NL*
two
brothers
who
do
not
dislike
it
.
So
many
instances
within
my
small
*NL*
circle
of
friends
is
remarkable
!
At
this
rate
,
I
shall
not
pity
the
*NL*
writers
of
history
any
longer
.
If
people
like
to
read
their
books
,
it
*NL*
is
all
very
well
,
but
to
be
at
so
much
trouble
in
filling
great
volumes
,
*NL*
which
,
as
I
used
to
think
,
nobody
would
willingly
ever
look
into
,
to
be
*NL*
labouring
only
for
the
torment
of
little
boys
and
girls
,
always
struck
*NL*
me
as
a
hard
fate
;
and
though
I
know
it
is
all
very
right
and
necessary
,
*NL*
I
have
often
wondered
at
the
person
's
courage
that
could
sit
down
on
*NL*
purpose
to
do
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
little
boys
and
girls
should
be
tormented
,
''
said
Henry
,
``
is
what
*NL*
no
one
at
all
acquainted
with
human
nature
in
a
civilized
state
can
*NL*
deny
;
but
in
behalf
of
our
most
distinguished
historians
,
I
must
observe
*NL*
that
they
might
well
be
offended
at
being
supposed
to
have
no
higher
*NL*
aim
,
and
that
by
their
method
and
style
,
they
are
perfectly
well
*NL*
qualified
to
torment
readers
of
the
most
advanced
reason
and
mature
*NL*
time
of
life
.
I
use
the
verb
`
to
torment
,
'
as
I
observed
to
be
your
own
*NL*
method
,
instead
of
`
to
instruct
,
'
supposing
them
to
be
now
admitted
as
*NL*
synonymous
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
think
me
foolish
to
call
instruction
a
torment
,
but
if
you
had
been
*NL*
as
much
used
as
myself
to
hear
poor
little
children
first
learning
their
*NL*
letters
and
then
learning
to
spell
,
if
you
had
ever
seen
how
stupid
they
*NL*
can
be
for
a
whole
morning
together
,
and
how
tired
my
poor
mother
is
*NL*
at
the
end
of
it
,
as
I
am
in
the
habit
of
seeing
almost
every
day
of
my
*NL*
life
at
home
,
you
would
allow
that
`
to
torment
'
and
`
to
instruct
'
might
*NL*
sometimes
be
used
as
synonymous
words
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
probably
.
But
historians
are
not
accountable
for
the
difficulty
*NL*
of
learning
to
read
;
and
even
you
yourself
,
who
do
not
altogether
seem
*NL*
particularly
friendly
to
very
severe
,
very
intense
application
,
may
*NL*
perhaps
be
brought
to
acknowledge
that
it
is
very
well
worth-while
to
*NL*
be
tormented
for
two
or
three
years
of
one
's
life
,
for
the
sake
of
*NL*
being
able
to
read
all
the
rest
of
it
.
Consider
--
if
reading
had
not
been
*NL*
taught
,
Mrs.
Radcliffe
would
have
written
in
vain
--
or
perhaps
might
not
*NL*
have
written
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Catherine
assented
--
and
a
very
warm
panegyric
from
her
on
that
lady
's
*NL*
merits
closed
the
subject
.
The
Tilneys
were
soon
engaged
in
another
on
*NL*
which
she
had
nothing
to
say
.
They
were
viewing
the
country
with
the
*NL*
eyes
of
persons
accustomed
to
drawing
,
and
decided
on
its
capability
of
*NL*
being
formed
into
pictures
,
with
all
the
eagerness
of
real
taste
.
Here
*NL*
Catherine
was
quite
lost
.
She
knew
nothing
of
drawing
--
nothing
of
taste
:
*NL*
and
she
listened
to
them
with
an
attention
which
brought
her
little
*NL*
profit
,
for
they
talked
in
phrases
which
conveyed
scarcely
any
idea
*NL*
to
her
.
The
little
which
she
could
understand
,
however
,
appeared
to
*NL*
contradict
the
very
few
notions
she
had
entertained
on
the
matter
*NL*
before
.
It
seemed
as
if
a
good
view
were
no
longer
to
be
taken
from
the
*NL*
top
of
an
high
hill
,
and
that
a
clear
blue
sky
was
no
longer
a
proof
*NL*
of
a
fine
day
.
She
was
heartily
ashamed
of
her
ignorance
.
A
misplaced
*NL*
shame
.
Where
people
wish
to
attach
,
they
should
always
be
ignorant
.
*NL*
To
come
with
a
well-informed
mind
is
to
come
with
an
inability
of
*NL*
administering
to
the
vanity
of
others
,
which
a
sensible
person
would
*NL*
always
wish
to
avoid
.
A
woman
especially
,
if
she
have
the
misfortune
of
*NL*
knowing
anything
,
should
conceal
it
as
well
as
she
can
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
advantages
of
natural
folly
in
a
beautiful
girl
have
been
already
*NL*
set
forth
by
the
capital
pen
of
a
sister
author
;
and
to
her
treatment
*NL*
of
the
subject
I
will
only
add
,
in
justice
to
men
,
that
though
to
the
*NL*
larger
and
more
trifling
part
of
the
sex
,
imbecility
in
females
is
a
*NL*
great
enhancement
of
their
personal
charms
,
there
is
a
portion
of
them
*NL*
too
reasonable
and
too
well
informed
themselves
to
desire
anything
*NL*
more
in
woman
than
ignorance
.
But
Catherine
did
not
know
her
own
*NL*
advantages
--
did
not
know
that
a
good-looking
girl
,
with
an
affectionate
*NL*
heart
and
a
very
ignorant
mind
,
can
not
fail
of
attracting
a
clever
young
*NL*
man
,
unless
circumstances
are
particularly
untoward
.
In
the
present
*NL*
instance
,
she
confessed
and
lamented
her
want
of
knowledge
,
declared
*NL*
that
she
would
give
anything
in
the
world
to
be
able
to
draw
;
and
*NL*
a
lecture
on
the
picturesque
immediately
followed
,
in
which
his
*NL*
instructions
were
so
clear
that
she
soon
began
to
see
beauty
in
*NL*
everything
admired
by
him
,
and
her
attention
was
so
earnest
that
he
*NL*
became
perfectly
satisfied
of
her
having
a
great
deal
of
natural
taste
.
*NL*
He
talked
of
foregrounds
,
distances
,
and
second
distances
--
side-screens
*NL*
and
perspectives
--
lights
and
shades
;
and
Catherine
was
so
hopeful
a
*NL*
scholar
that
when
they
gained
the
top
of
Beechen
Cliff
,
she
voluntarily
*NL*
rejected
the
whole
city
of
Bath
as
unworthy
to
make
part
of
a
landscape
.
*NL*
Delighted
with
her
progress
,
and
fearful
of
wearying
her
with
too
much
*NL*
wisdom
at
once
,
Henry
suffered
the
subject
to
decline
,
and
by
an
easy
*NL*
transition
from
a
piece
of
rocky
fragment
and
the
withered
oak
which
*NL*
he
had
placed
near
its
summit
,
to
oaks
in
general
,
to
forests
,
the
*NL*
enclosure
of
them
,
waste
lands
,
crown
lands
and
government
,
he
shortly
*NL*
found
himself
arrived
at
politics
;
and
from
politics
,
it
was
an
*NL*
easy
step
to
silence
.
The
general
pause
which
succeeded
his
short
*NL*
disquisition
on
the
state
of
the
nation
was
put
an
end
to
by
Catherine
,
*NL*
who
,
in
rather
a
solemn
tone
of
voice
,
uttered
these
words
,
``
I
have
*NL*
heard
that
something
very
shocking
indeed
will
soon
come
out
in
London
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Tilney
,
to
whom
this
was
chiefly
addressed
,
was
startled
,
and
*NL*
hastily
replied
,
``
Indeed
!
And
of
what
nature
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
I
do
not
know
,
nor
who
is
the
author

I
have
only
heard
that
it
is

be
more
horrible
than
anything
we
have
met
with
yet

*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
heaven
!
Where
could
you
hear
of
such
a
thing
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
particular
friend
of
mine
had
an
account
of
it
in
a
letter
from
*NL*
London
yesterday
.

be
uncommonly
dreadful
.
I
shall
expect
murder
*NL*
and
everything

the
kind

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
speak
with
astonishing
composure
!
But
I
hope
your
friend
's
accounts
*NL*
have
been
exaggerated
;
and
if
such
a
design
is
known
beforehand
,
proper
*NL*
measures
will
undoubtedly
be
taken
by
government
to
prevent
its
coming
*NL*
to
effect

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Government
,
''
said
Henry
,
endeavouring
not
to
smile
,
``
neither
desires
*NL*
nor
dares

interfere

matters

There
must
be
murder

The
ladies
stared
.
He
laughed
,
and
added
,
``
Come

shall
I
make
you

out

you

with

of

sex

disdain

let
themselves
sometimes
down

you

conceiving

done

such

he
must
be
entirely
*NL*
misunderstood
,
if
he
can
ever
appear
to
say
an
unjust
thing
of
any
woman
*NL*
at
all
,
or
an
unkind
one
of
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
no
effort
to
Catherine
to
believe
that
Henry
Tilney
could
never
*NL*
be
wrong
.
His
manner
might
sometimes
surprise
,
but
his
meaning
must
*NL*
always
be
just
:
and
what
she
did
not
understand
,
she
was
almost
as
ready
*NL*
to
admire
,
as
what
she
did
.
The
whole
walk
was
delightful
,
and
though
it
*NL*
ended
too
soon
,
its
conclusion
was
delightful
too
;
her
friends
attended
*NL*
her
into
the
house
,
and
Miss
Tilney
,
before
they
parted
,
addressing
*NL*
herself
with
respectful
form
,
as
much
to
Mrs.
Allen
as
to
Catherine
,
*NL*
petitioned
for
the
pleasure
of
her
company
to
dinner
on
the
day
after
*NL*
the
next
.
No
difficulty
was
made
on
Mrs.
Allen
's
side
,
and
the
only
*NL*
difficulty
on
Catherine
's
was
in
concealing
the
excess
of
her
pleasure
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
morning
had
passed
away
so
charmingly
as
to
banish
all
her
*NL*
friendship
and
natural
affection
,
for
no
thought
of
Isabella
or
James
*NL*
had
crossed
her
during
their
walk
.
When
the
Tilneys
were
gone
,
she
*NL*
became
amiable
again
,
but
she
was
amiable
for
some
time
to
little
*NL*
effect
;
Mrs.
Allen
had
no
intelligence
to
give
that
could
relieve
her
*NL*
anxiety
;
she
had
heard
nothing
of
any
of
them
.
Towards
the
end
of
the
*NL*
morning
,
however
,
Catherine
,
having
occasion
for
some
indispensable
yard
*NL*
of
ribbon
which
must
be
bought
without
a
moment
's
delay
,
walked
out
into
*NL*
the
town
,
and
in
Bond
Street
overtook
the
second
Miss
Thorpe
as
she
was
*NL*
loitering
towards
Edgar
's
Buildings
between
two
of
the
sweetest
girls
in
*NL*
the
world
,
who
had
been
her
dear
friends
all
the
morning
.
From
her
,
she
*NL*
soon
learned
that
the
party
to
Clifton
had
taken
place
.
``
They
set
off
at
*NL*
eight
this
morning
,
''
said
Miss
Anne
,
``
and
I
am
sure
I
do
not
envy
*NL*
them
their
drive
.
I
think
you
and
I
are
very
well
off
to
be
out
of
the
*NL*
scrape
.
It
must
be
the
dullest
thing
in
the
world
,
for
there
is
not
a
*NL*
soul
at
Clifton
at
this
time
of
year
.
Belle
went
with
your
brother
,
and
*NL*
John
drove
Maria
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Catherine
spoke
the
pleasure
she
really
felt
on
hearing
this
part
of
the
*NL*
arrangement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
yes
,
''
rejoined
the
other
,
``
Maria
is
gone
.
She
was
quite
wild
to
go
.
*NL*
She
thought
it
would
be
something
very
fine
.
I
can
not
say
I
admire
her
*NL*
taste
;
and
for
my
part
,
I
was
determined
from
the
first
not
to
go
,
if
*NL*
they
pressed
me
ever
so
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Catherine
,
a
little
doubtful
of
this
,
could
not
help
answering
,
``
I
wish
*NL*
you
could
have
gone
too
.
It
is
a
pity
you
could
not
all
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
;
but
it
is
quite
a
matter
of
indifference
to
me
.
Indeed
,
I
*NL*
would
not
have
gone
on
any
account
.
I
was
saying
so
to
Emily
and
Sophia
*NL*
when
you
overtook
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Catherine
was
still
unconvinced
;
but
glad
that
Anne
should
have
the
*NL*
friendship
of
an
Emily
and
a
Sophia
to
console
her
,
she
bade
her
adieu
*NL*
without
much
uneasiness
,
and
returned
home
,
pleased
that
the
party
had
*NL*
not
been
prevented
by
her
refusing
to
join
it
,
and
very
heartily
wishing
*NL*
that
it
might
be
too
pleasant
to
allow
either
James
or
Isabella
to
*NL*
resent
her
resistance
any
longer
.

CHAPTER
15
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Early
the
next
day
,
a
note
from
Isabella
,
speaking
peace
and
tenderness
*NL*
in
every
line
,
and
entreating
the
immediate
presence
of
her
friend
on
*NL*
a
matter
of
the
utmost
importance
,
hastened
Catherine
,
in
the
happiest
*NL*
state
of
confidence
and
curiosity
,
to
Edgar
's
Buildings
.
The
two
*NL*
youngest
Miss
Thorpes
were
by
themselves
in
the
parlour
;
and
,
on
Anne
's
*NL*
quitting
it
to
call
her
sister
,
Catherine
took
the
opportunity
of
asking
*NL*
the
other
for
some
particulars
of
their
yesterday
's
party
.
Maria
desired
*NL*
no
greater
pleasure
than
to
speak
of
it
;
and
Catherine
immediately
*NL*
learnt
that
it
had
been
altogether
the
most
delightful
scheme
in
the
*NL*
world
,
that
nobody
could
imagine
how
charming
it
had
been
,
and
that
*NL*
it
had
been
more
delightful
than
anybody
could
conceive
.
Such
was
the
*NL*
information
of
the
first
five
minutes
;
the
second
unfolded
thus
much
in
*NL*
detail
--
that
they
had
driven
directly
to
the
York
Hotel
,
ate
some
soup
,
*NL*
and
bespoke
an
early
dinner
,
walked
down
to
the
pump-room
,
tasted
the
*NL*
water
,
and
laid
out
some
shillings
in
purses
and
spars
;
thence
adjourned
*NL*
to
eat
ice
at
a
pastry-cook
's
,
and
hurrying
back
to
the
hotel
,
swallowed
*NL*
their
dinner
in
haste
,
to
prevent
being
in
the
dark
;
and
then
had
a
*NL*
delightful
drive
back
,
only
the
moon
was
not
up
,
and
it
rained
a
little
,
*NL*
and
Mr.
Morland
's
horse
was
so
tired
he
could
hardly
get
it
along
.
*NL*
*NL*
Catherine
listened
with
heartfelt
satisfaction
.
It
appeared
that
Blaize
*NL*
Castle
had
never
been
thought
of
;
and
,
as
for
all
the
rest
,
there
was
*NL*
nothing
to
regret
for
half
an
instant
.
Maria
's
intelligence
concluded
*NL*
with
a
tender
effusion
of
pity
for
her
sister
Anne
,
whom
she
represented
*NL*
as
insupportably
cross
,
from
being
excluded
the
party
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
will
never
forgive
me
,
I
am
sure
;
but
,
you
know
,
how
could
I
help
*NL*
it
?
John
would
have
me
go
,
for
he
vowed
he
would
not
drive
her
,
because
*NL*
she
had
such
thick
ankles
.
I
dare
say
she
will
not
be
in
good
humour
*NL*
again
this
month
;
but
I
am
determined
I
will
not
be
cross
;
it
is
not
a
*NL*
little
matter
that
puts
me
out
of
temper
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabella
now
entered
the
room
with
so
eager
a
step
,
and
a
look
of
such
*NL*
happy
importance
,
as
engaged
all
her
friend
's
notice
.
Maria
was
without
*NL*
ceremony
sent
away
,
and
Isabella
,
embracing
Catherine
,
thus
began
:
``
Yes
,
*NL*
my
dear
Catherine
,
it
is
so
indeed
;
your
penetration
has
not
deceived
*NL*
you
.
Oh
!
That
arch
eye
of
yours
!
It
sees
through
everything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Catherine
replied
only
by
a
look
of
wondering
ignorance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
my
beloved
,
sweetest
friend
,
''
continued
the
other
,
``
compose
*NL*
yourself
.
I
am
amazingly
agitated
,
as
you
perceive
.
Let
us
sit
down
and
*NL*
talk
in
comfort
.
Well
,
and
so
you
guessed
it
the
moment
you
had
my
note
?
*NL*
Sly
creature
!
Oh
!
My
dear
Catherine
,
you
alone
,
who
know
my
heart
,
can
*NL*
judge
of
my
present
happiness
.
Your
brother
is
the
most
charming
of
*NL*
men
.
I
only
wish
I
were
more
worthy
of
him
.
But
what
will
your
excellent
*NL*
father
and
mother
say
?
Oh
!
Heavens
!
When
I
think
of
them
I
am
so
*NL*
agitated
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Catherine
's
understanding
began
to
awake
:
an
idea
of
the
truth
suddenly
*NL*
darted
into
her
mind
;
and
,
with
the
natural
blush
of
so
new
an
emotion
,
*NL*
she
cried
out
,
``
Good
heaven
!
My
dear
Isabella
,
what
do
you
mean
?
Can
*NL*
you
--
can
you
really
be
in
love
with
James
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
bold
surmise
,
however
,
she
soon
learnt
comprehended
but
half
the
*NL*
fact
.
The
anxious
affection
,
which
she
was
accused
of
having
continually
*NL*
watched
in
Isabella
's
every
look
and
action
,
had
,
in
the
course
of
their
*NL*
yesterday
's
party
,
received
the
delightful
confession
of
an
equal
love
.
*NL*
Her
heart
and
faith
were
alike
engaged
to
James
.
Never
had
Catherine
*NL*
listened
to
anything
so
full
of
interest
,
wonder
,
and
joy
.
Her
brother
*NL*
and
her
friend
engaged
!
New
to
such
circumstances
,
the
importance
of
*NL*
it
appeared
unspeakably
great
,
and
she
contemplated
it
as
one
of
those
*NL*
grand
events
,
of
which
the
ordinary
course
of
life
can
hardly
afford
a
*NL*
return
.
The
strength
of
her
feelings
she
could
not
express
;
the
nature
*NL*
of
them
,
however
,
contented
her
friend
.
The
happiness
of
having
such
a
*NL*
sister
was
their
first
effusion
,
and
the
fair
ladies
mingled
in
embraces
*NL*
and
tears
of
joy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Delighting
,
however
,
as
Catherine
sincerely
did
in
the
prospect
of
the
*NL*
connection
,
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
Isabella
far
surpassed
her
*NL*
in
tender
anticipations
.
``
You
will
be
so
infinitely
dearer
to
me
,
my
*NL*
Catherine
,
than
either
Anne
or
Maria
:
I
feel
that
I
shall
be
so
much
*NL*
more
attached
to
my
dear
Morland
's
family
than
to
my
own
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
a
pitch
of
friendship
beyond
Catherine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
so
like
your
dear
brother
,
''
continued
Isabella
,
``
that
I
quite
*NL*
doted
on
you
the
first
moment
I
saw
you
.
But
so
it
always
is
with
me
;
*NL*
the
first
moment
settles
everything
.
The
very
first
day
that
Morland
*NL*
came
to
us
last
Christmas
--
the
very
first
moment
I
beheld
him
--
my
heart
*NL*
was
irrecoverably
gone
.
I
remember
I
wore
my
yellow
gown
,
with
my
hair
*NL*
done
up
in
braids
;
and
when
I
came
into
the
drawing-room
,
and
John
*NL*
introduced
him
,
I
thought
I
never
saw
anybody
so
handsome
before
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
Catherine
secretly
acknowledged
the
power
of
love
;
for
,
though
*NL*
exceedingly
fond
of
her
brother
,
and
partial
to
all
his
endowments
,
she
*NL*
had
never
in
her
life
thought
him
handsome
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
remember
too
,
Miss
Andrews
drank
tea
with
us
that
evening
,
and
wore
*NL*
her
puce-coloured
sarsenet
;
and
she
looked
so
heavenly
that
I
thought
*NL*
your
brother
must
certainly
fall
in
love
with
her
;
I
could
not
sleep
*NL*
a
wink
all
right
for
thinking
of
it
.
Oh
!
Catherine
,
the
many
sleepless
*NL*
nights
I
have
had
on
your
brother
's
account
!
I
would
not
have
you
suffer
*NL*
half
what
I
have
done
!
I
am
grown
wretchedly
thin
,
I
know
;
but
I
will
*NL*
not
pain
you
by
describing
my
anxiety
;
you
have
seen
enough
of
it
.
I
*NL*
feel
that
I
have
betrayed
myself
perpetually
--
so
unguarded
in
speaking
*NL*
of
my
partiality
for
the
church
!
But
my
secret
I
was
always
sure
would
*NL*
be
safe
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Catherine
felt
that
nothing
could
have
been
safer
;
but
ashamed
of
an
*NL*
ignorance
little
expected
,
she
dared
no
longer
contest
the
point
,
*NL*
nor
refuse
to
have
been
as
full
of
arch
penetration
and
affectionate
*NL*
sympathy
as
Isabella
chose
to
consider
her
.
Her
brother
,
she
found
,
*NL*
was
preparing
to
set
off
with
all
speed
to
Fullerton
,
to
make
known
his
*NL*
situation
and
ask
consent
;
and
here
was
a
source
of
some
real
agitation
*NL*
to
the
mind
of
Isabella
.
Catherine
endeavoured
to
persuade
her
,
as
she
*NL*
was
herself
persuaded
,
that
her
father
and
mother
would
never
oppose
*NL*
their
son
's
wishes
.
``
It
is
impossible
,
''
said
she
,
``
for
parents
to
be
*NL*
more
kind
,
or
more
desirous
of
their
children
's
happiness
;
I
have
no
*NL*
doubt
of
their
consenting
immediately
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Morland
says
exactly
the
same
,
''
replied
Isabella
;
``
and
yet
I
dare
not
*NL*
expect
it
;
my
fortune
will
be
so
small
;
they
never
can
consent
to
it
.
*NL*
Your
brother
,
who
might
marry
anybody
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
Catherine
again
discerned
the
force
of
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
Isabella
,
you
are
too
humble
.
The
difference
of
fortune
can
be
*NL*
nothing
to
signify
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
My
sweet
Catherine
,
in
your
generous
heart
I
know
it
would
signify
*NL*
nothing
;
but
we
must
not
expect
such
disinterestedness
in
many
.
As
for
*NL*
myself
,
I
am
sure
I
only
wish
our
situations
were
reversed
.
Had
I
the
*NL*
command
of
millions
,
were
I
mistress
of
the
whole
world
,
your
brother
*NL*
would
be
my
only
choice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
charming
sentiment
,
recommended
as
much
by
sense
as
novelty
,
*NL*
gave
Catherine
a
most
pleasing
remembrance
of
all
the
heroines
of
her
*NL*
acquaintance
;
and
she
thought
her
friend
never
looked
more
lovely
than
*NL*
in
uttering
the
grand
idea
.
``
I
am
sure
they
will
consent
,
''
was
her
*NL*
frequent
declaration
;
``
I
am
sure
they
will
be
delighted
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
my
own
part
,
''
said
Isabella
,
``
my
wishes
are
so
moderate
that
the
*NL*
smallest
income
in
nature
would
be
enough
for
me
.
Where
people
are
*NL*
really
attached
,
poverty
itself
is
wealth
;
grandeur
I
detest
:
I
would
*NL*
not
settle
in
London
for
the
universe
.
A
cottage
in
some
retired
village
*NL*
would
be
ecstasy
.
There
are
some
charming
little
villas
about
Richmond
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Richmond
!
''
cried
Catherine
.
``
You
must
settle
near
Fullerton
.
You
must
*NL*
be
near
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sure
I
shall
be
miserable
if
we
do
not
.
If
I
can
but
be
near
you
,
*NL*
I
shall
be
satisfied
.
But
this
is
idle
talking
!
I
will
not
allow
myself
*NL*
to
think
of
such
things
,
till
we
have
your
father
's
answer
.
Morland
*NL*
says
that
by
sending
it
tonight
to
Salisbury
,
we
may
have
it
tomorrow
.
*NL*
Tomorrow
?
I
know
I
shall
never
have
courage
to
open
the
letter
.
I
know
*NL*
it
will
be
the
death
of
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
reverie
succeeded
this
conviction
--
and
when
Isabella
spoke
again
,
it
*NL*
was
to
resolve
on
the
quality
of
her
wedding-gown
.
*NL*
*NL*
Their
conference
was
put
an
end
to
by
the
anxious
young
lover
himself
,
*NL*
who
came
to
breathe
his
parting
sigh
before
he
set
off
for
Wiltshire
.
*NL*
Catherine
wished
to
congratulate
him
,
but
knew
not
what
to
say
,
and
her
*NL*
eloquence
was
only
in
her
eyes
.
From
them
,
however
,
the
eight
parts
of
*NL*
speech
shone
out
most
expressively
,
and
James
could
combine
them
with
*NL*
ease
.
Impatient
for
the
realization
of
all
that
he
hoped
at
home
,
his
*NL*
adieus
were
not
long
;
and
they
would
have
been
yet
shorter
,
had
he
not
*NL*
been
frequently
detained
by
the
urgent
entreaties
of
his
fair
one
that
*NL*
he
would
go
.
Twice
was
he
called
almost
from
the
door
by
her
eagerness
*NL*
to
have
him
gone
.
``
Indeed
,
Morland
,
I
must
drive
you
away
.
Consider
how
*NL*
far
you
have
to
ride
.
I
can
not
bear
to
see
you
linger
so
.
For
heaven
's
*NL*
sake
,
waste
no
more
time
.
There
,
go
,
go
--
I
insist
on
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
friends
,
with
hearts
now
more
united
than
ever
,
were
inseparable
*NL*
for
the
day
;
and
in
schemes
of
sisterly
happiness
the
hours
flew
along
.
*NL*
Mrs.
Thorpe
and
her
son
,
who
were
acquainted
with
everything
,
and
*NL*
who
seemed
only
to
want
Mr.
Morland
's
consent
,
to
consider
Isabella
's
*NL*
engagement
as
the
most
fortunate
circumstance
imaginable
for
their
*NL*
family
,
were
allowed
to
join
their
counsels
,
and
add
their
quota
of
*NL*
significant
looks
and
mysterious
expressions
to
fill
up
the
measure
*NL*
of
curiosity
to
be
raised
in
the
unprivileged
younger
sisters
.
To
*NL*
Catherine
's
simple
feelings
,
this
odd
sort
of
reserve
seemed
neither
*NL*
kindly
meant
,
nor
consistently
supported
;
and
its
unkindness
she
would
*NL*
hardly
have
forborne
pointing
out
,
had
its
inconsistency
been
less
their
*NL*
friend
;
but
Anne
and
Maria
soon
set
her
heart
at
ease
by
the
sagacity
of
*NL*
their
``
I
know
what
''
;
and
the
evening
was
spent
in
a
sort
of
war
of
wit
,
*NL*
a
display
of
family
ingenuity
,
on
one
side
in
the
mystery
of
an
affected
*NL*
secret
,
on
the
other
of
undefined
discovery
,
all
equally
acute
.
*NL*
*NL*
Catherine
was
with
her
friend
again
the
next
day
,
endeavouring
to
*NL*
support
her
spirits
and
while
away
the
many
tedious
hours
before
*NL*
the
delivery
of
the
letters
;
a
needful
exertion
,
for
as
the
time
*NL*
of
reasonable
expectation
drew
near
,
Isabella
became
more
and
more
*NL*
desponding
,
and
before
the
letter
arrived
,
had
worked
herself
into
a
*NL*
state
of
real
distress
.
But
when
it
did
come
,
where
could
distress
*NL*
be
found
?
``
I
have
had
no
difficulty
in
gaining
the
consent
of
my
kind
*NL*
parents
,
and
am
promised
that
everything
in
their
power
shall
be
done
to
*NL*
forward
my
happiness
,
''
were
the
first
three
lines
,
and
in
one
moment
*NL*
all
was
joyful
security
.
The
brightest
glow
was
instantly
spread
over
*NL*
Isabella
's
features
,
all
care
and
anxiety
seemed
removed
,
her
spirits
*NL*
became
almost
too
high
for
control
,
and
she
called
herself
without
*NL*
scruple
the
happiest
of
mortals
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Thorpe
,
with
tears
of
joy
,
embraced
her
daughter
,
her
son
,
her
*NL*
visitor
,
and
could
have
embraced
half
the
inhabitants
of
Bath
with
*NL*
satisfaction
.
Her
heart
was
overflowing
with
tenderness
.
It
was
``
dear
*NL*
John
''
and
``
dear
Catherine
''
at
every
word
;
``
dear
Anne
and
dear
Maria
''
*NL*
must
immediately
be
made
sharers
in
their
felicity
;
and
two
``
dears
''
at
*NL*
once
before
the
name
of
Isabella
were
not
more
than
that
beloved
child
*NL*
had
now
well
earned
.
John
himself
was
no
skulker
in
joy
.
He
not
only
*NL*
bestowed
on
Mr.
Morland
the
high
commendation
of
being
one
of
the
finest
*NL*
fellows
in
the
world
,
but
swore
off
many
sentences
in
his
praise
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
letter
,
whence
sprang
all
this
felicity
,
was
short
,
containing
*NL*
little
more
than
this
assurance
of
success
;
and
every
particular
was
*NL*
deferred
till
James
could
write
again
.
But
for
particulars
Isabella
*NL*
could
well
afford
to
wait
.
The
needful
was
comprised
in
Mr.
Morland
's
*NL*
promise
;
his
honour
was
pledged
to
make
everything
easy
;
and
by
what
*NL*
means
their
income
was
to
be
formed
,
whether
landed
property
were
to
*NL*
be
resigned
,
or
funded
money
made
over
,
was
a
matter
in
which
her
*NL*
disinterested
spirit
took
no
concern
.
She
knew
enough
to
feel
secure
of
*NL*
an
honourable
and
speedy
establishment
,
and
her
imagination
took
a
rapid
*NL*
flight
over
its
attendant
felicities
.
She
saw
herself
at
the
end
of
*NL*
a
few
weeks
,
the
gaze
and
admiration
of
every
new
acquaintance
at
*NL*
Fullerton
,
the
envy
of
every
valued
old
friend
in
Putney
,
with
a
*NL*
carriage
at
her
command
,
a
new
name
on
her
tickets
,
and
a
brilliant
*NL*
exhibition
of
hoop
rings
on
her
finger
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
contents
of
the
letter
were
ascertained
,
John
Thorpe
,
who
had
*NL*
only
waited
its
arrival
to
begin
his
journey
to
London
,
prepared
to
set
*NL*
off
.
``
Well
,
Miss
Morland
,
''
said
he
,
on
finding
her
alone
in
the
parlour
,
*NL*
``
I
am
come
to
bid
you
good-bye
.
''
Catherine
wished
him
a
good
journey
.
*NL*
Without
appearing
to
hear
her
,
he
walked
to
the
window
,
fidgeted
about
,
*NL*
hummed
a
tune
,
and
seemed
wholly
self-occupied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
not
you
be
late
at
Devizes
?
''
said
Catherine
.
He
made
no
answer
;
*NL*
but
after
a
minute
's
silence
burst
out
with
,
``
A
famous
good
thing
this
*NL*
marrying
scheme
,
upon
my
soul
!
A
clever
fancy
of
Morland
's
and
Belle
's
.
*NL*
What
do
you
think
of
it
,
Miss
Morland
?
I
say
it
is
no
bad
notion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sure
I
think
it
a
very
good
one

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you

That
's
honest

by
heavens
!
I
am
glad
you
are
no
enemy
to

matrimony
,
however
.
Did
you
ever
hear
the
old
song
`
Going
to
One
Wedding

Brings
on
Another
?

I
say
,
you
will
come
to
Belle
's
wedding
,
I
hope

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

I
have
promised
your
sister
to
be
with
her
,
if
possible
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
then
you
know
''
--
twisting
himself
about
and
forcing
a
foolish
*NL*
laugh
--
``
I
say
,
then
you
know
,
we
may
try
the
truth
of
this
same
old
*NL*
song

*NL*
*NL*
``
May
we

But
I
never
sing

Well

I
wish
you
a
good
journey

dine
with

Miss
Tilney
today
,
and
must
now
be
going
home

*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay

but
there
is
no
such
confounded
hurry

Who
knows
when
we
may
*NL*
be
together
again

Not
but
that
I
shall
be
down
again
by
the
end
of
a
*NL*
fortnight
,
and
a
devilish
long
fortnight
it
will
appear
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
why
do
you
stay
away
so
long
?
''
replied
Catherine
--
finding
that
he
*NL*
waited
for
an
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
kind
of
you

however

kind

good-natured

I
shall
not

hurry

But
you
have
more
good
nature

all
that

than
anybody
*NL*
living

I
believe

A
monstrous

good

``
But

That

the
company

I.
And
*NL*
I
am
heartily
glad
to
hear
you

But
I
have
a
notion

Miss

you
and
I
think
pretty
much
alike
upon
most
matters

*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
we
may
;
but
it
is
more
than
I
ever
thought
of

And
as
to
most
*NL*
matters
,
to
say
the
truth
,
there
are
not
many
that
I
know
my
own
mind
*NL*
about
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
Jove
,
no
more
do
I

It
is
not
my
way
to
bother
my
brains
with
what
*NL*
does
not
concern
me

My
notion
of
things
is
simple
enough

Let
me
only
*NL*
have
the
girl
I
like

say
I
,
with
a
comfortable
house
over
my
head
,
and
*NL*
what
care
I
for
all
the
rest
?
Fortune
is
nothing
.
I
am
sure
of
a
good
*NL*
income
of
my
own
;

if
she
had
not
a
penny

why
,
so
much
the
better

*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
true

there
is
a
good

side

can
be
no
occasion

No
matter

has
it

so
that
there
is
enough

I
hate
the
idea

one
great
fortune
*NL*
looking
out
for
another

And
to
marry
for
money
I
think
the
wickedest
*NL*
thing
in
existence

Good

We
shall
be
very
glad
to
see
you
at
*NL*
Fullerton
,
whenever
it
is
convenient

''
And
away
she
went
.
It
was
not
in
*NL*
the
power
of
all
his
gallantry
to
detain
her
longer
.
With
such
news
to
*NL*
communicate
,
and
such
a
visit
to
prepare
for
,
her
departure
was
not
*NL*
to
be
delayed
by
anything
in
his
nature
to
urge
;
and
she
hurried
away
,
*NL*
leaving
him
to
the
undivided
consciousness
of
his
own
happy
address
,
and
*NL*
her
explicit
encouragement
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
agitation
which
she
had
herself
experienced
on
first
learning
her
*NL*
brother
's
engagement
made
her
expect
to
raise
no
inconsiderable
emotion
*NL*
in
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Allen
,
by
the
communication
of
the
wonderful
event
.
How
*NL*
great
was
her
disappointment
!
The
important
affair
,
which
many
words
of
*NL*
preparation
ushered
in
,
had
been
foreseen
by
them
both
ever
since
*NL*
her
brother
's
arrival
;
and
all
that
they
felt
on
the
occasion
was
*NL*
comprehended
in
a
wish
for
the
young
people
's
happiness
,
with
a
remark
,
*NL*
on
the
gentleman
's
side
,
in
favour
of
Isabella
's
beauty
,
and
on
the
*NL*
lady
's
,
of
her
great
good
luck
.
It
was
to
Catherine
the
most
surprising
*NL*
insensibility
.
The
disclosure
,
however
,
of
the
great
secret
of
James
's
*NL*
going
to
Fullerton
the
day
before
,
did
raise
some
emotion
in
Mrs.
Allen
.
*NL*
She
could
not
listen
to
that
with
perfect
calmness
,
but
repeatedly
*NL*
regretted
the
necessity
of
its
concealment
,
wished
she
could
have
known
*NL*
his
intention
,
wished
she
could
have
seen
him
before
he
went
,
as
she
*NL*
should
certainly
have
troubled
him
with
her
best
regards
to
his
father
*NL*
and
mother

and
her
kind
compliments
to
all
the

CHAPTER
16
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Catherine
's
expectations
of
pleasure
from
her
visit
in
Milsom
Street
*NL*
were
so
very
high
that
disappointment
was
inevitable
;
and
accordingly
,
*NL*
though
she
was
most
politely
received
by
General
Tilney
,
and
kindly
*NL*
welcomed
by
his
daughter
,
though
Henry
was
at
home
,
and
no
one
else
of
*NL*
the
party
,
she
found
,
on
her
return
,
without
spending
many
hours
in
*NL*
the
examination
of
her
feelings
,
that
she
had
gone
to
her
appointment
*NL*
preparing
for
happiness
which
it
had
not
afforded
.
Instead
of
finding
*NL*
herself
improved
in
acquaintance
with
Miss
Tilney
,
from
the
intercourse
*NL*
of
the
day
,
she
seemed
hardly
so
intimate
with
her
as
before
;
instead
*NL*
of
seeing
Henry
Tilney
to
greater
advantage
than
ever
,
in
the
ease
of
a
*NL*
family
party
,
he
had
never
said
so
little
,
nor
been
so
little
agreeable
;
*NL*
and
,
in
spite
of
their
father
's
great
civilities
to
her
--
in
spite
of
his
*NL*
thanks
,
invitations
,
and
compliments
--
it
had
been
a
release
to
get
*NL*
away
from
him
.
It
puzzled
her
to
account
for
all
this
.
It
could
not
*NL*
be
General
Tilney
's
fault
.
That
he
was
perfectly
agreeable
and
*NL*
good-natured
,
and
altogether
a
very
charming
man
,
did
not
admit
of
a
*NL*
doubt
,
for
he
was
tall
and
handsome
,
and
Henry
's
father
.
He
could
not
*NL*
be
accountable
for
his
children
's
want
of
spirits
,
or
for
her
want
of
*NL*
enjoyment
in
his
company
.
The
former
she
hoped
at
last
might
have
*NL*
been
accidental
,
and
the
latter
she
could
only
attribute
to
her
own
*NL*
stupidity
.
Isabella
,
on
hearing
the
particulars
of
the
visit
,
gave
*NL*
a
different
explanation
:
``
It
was
all
pride
,
pride
,
insufferable
*NL*
haughtiness
and
pride
!
She
had
long
suspected
the
family
to
be
very
*NL*
high
,
and
this
made
it
certain
.
Such
insolence
of
behaviour
as
Miss
*NL*
Tilney
's
she
had
never
heard
of
in
her
life
!
Not
to
do
the
honours
of
*NL*
her
house
with
common
good
breeding
!
To
behave
to
her
guest
with
such
*NL*
superciliousness
!
Hardly
even
to
speak
to
her
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
was
not
so
bad
as
that
,
Isabella
;
there
was
no
superciliousness
;
*NL*
she
was
very
civil
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
Do
n't
defend
her
!
And
then
the
brother
,
he
,
who
had
appeared
*NL*
so
attached
to
you
!
Good
heavens
!
Well
,
some
people
's
feelings
are
*NL*
incomprehensible
.
And
so
he
hardly
looked
once
at
you
the
whole
day
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
say
so
;
but
he
did
not
seem
in
good
spirits
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
contemptible
!
Of
all
things
in
the
world
inconstancy
is
my
*NL*
aversion
.
Let
me
entreat
you
never
to
think
of
him
again
,
my
dear
*NL*
Catherine
;
indeed
he
is
unworthy
of
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Unworthy
!
I
do
not
suppose
he
ever
thinks
of
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
exactly
what
I
say
;
he
never
thinks
of
you
.
Such
fickleness
!
*NL*
Oh
!
How
different
to
your
brother
and
to
mine
!
I
really
believe
John
has
*NL*
the
most
constant
heart
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
as
for
General
Tilney
,
I
assure
you
it
would
be
impossible
for
*NL*
anybody
to
behave
to
me
with
greater
civility
and
attention
;
it
seemed
*NL*
to
be
his
only
care
to
entertain
and
make
me
happy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
I
know
no
harm
of
him
;
I
do
not
suspect
him
of
pride
.
I
believe
he
*NL*
is
a
very
gentleman-like
man
.
John
thinks
very
well
of
him
,
and
John
's
*NL*
judgment
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
shall
see
how
they
behave
to
me
this
evening
;
we
shall
meet
*NL*
them
at
the
rooms
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
must
I
go
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
not
you
intend
it
?
I
thought
it
was
all
settled
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
since
you
make
such
a
point
of
it
,
I
can
refuse
you
nothing
.
But
*NL*
do
not
insist
upon
my
being
very
agreeable
,
for
my
heart
,
you
know
,
will
*NL*
be
some
forty
miles
off
.
And
as
for
dancing
,
do
not
mention
it
,
I
beg
;
*NL*
that
is
quite
out
of
the
question
.
Charles
Hodges
will
plague
me
to
*NL*
death
,
I
dare
say
;
but
I
shall
cut
him
very
short
.
Ten
to
one
but
he
*NL*
guesses
the
reason
,
and
that
is
exactly
what
I
want
to
avoid
,
so
I
shall
*NL*
insist
on
his
keeping
his
conjecture
to
himself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabella
's
opinion
of
the
Tilneys
did
not
influence
her
friend
;
she
was
*NL*
sure
there
had
been
no
insolence
in
the
manners
either
of
brother
or
*NL*
sister
;
and
she
did
not
credit
there
being
any
pride
in
their
hearts
.
*NL*
The
evening
rewarded
her
confidence
;
she
was
met
by
one
with
the
same
*NL*
kindness
,
and
by
the
other
with
the
same
attention
,
as
heretofore
:
Miss
*NL*
Tilney
took
pains
to
be
near
her
,
and
Henry
asked
her
to
dance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
heard
the
day
before
in
Milsom
Street
that
their
elder
brother
,
*NL*
Captain
Tilney
,
was
expected
almost
every
hour
,
she
was
at
no
loss
for
*NL*
the
name
of
a
very
fashionable-looking
,
handsome
young
man
,
whom
she
had
*NL*
never
seen
before
,
and
who
now
evidently
belonged
to
their
party
.
She
*NL*
looked
at
him
with
great
admiration
,
and
even
supposed
it
possible
that
*NL*
some
people
might
think
him
handsomer
than
his
brother
,
though
,
in
her
*NL*
eyes
,
his
air
was
more
assuming
,
and
his
countenance
less
prepossessing
.
*NL*
His
taste
and
manners
were
beyond
a
doubt
decidedly
inferior
;
for
,
*NL*
within
her
hearing
,
he
not
only
protested
against
every
thought
of
*NL*
dancing
himself
,
but
even
laughed
openly
at
Henry
for
finding
it
*NL*
possible
.
From
the
latter
circumstance
it
may
be
presumed
that
,
whatever
*NL*
might
be
our
heroine
's
opinion
of
him
,
his
admiration
of
her
was
not
*NL*
of
a
very
dangerous
kind
;
not
likely
to
produce
animosities
between
the
*NL*
brothers
,
nor
persecutions
to
the
lady
.
He
can
not
be
the
instigator
of
*NL*
the
three
villains
in
horsemen
's
greatcoats
,
by
whom
she
will
hereafter
*NL*
be
forced
into
a
traveling-chaise
and
four
,
which
will
drive
off
with
*NL*
incredible
speed
.
Catherine
,
meanwhile
,
undisturbed
by
presentiments
of
*NL*
such
an
evil
,
or
of
any
evil
at
all
,
except
that
of
having
but
a
short
*NL*
set
to
dance
down
,
enjoyed
her
usual
happiness
with
Henry
Tilney
,
*NL*
listening
with
sparkling
eyes
to
everything
he
said
;
and
,
in
finding
him
*NL*
irresistible
,
becoming
so
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
end
of
the
first
dance
,
Captain
Tilney
came
towards
them
again
,
*NL*
and
,
much
to
Catherine
's
dissatisfaction
,
pulled
his
brother
away
.
They
*NL*
retired
whispering
together
;
and
,
though
her
delicate
sensibility
did
*NL*
not
take
immediate
alarm
,
and
lay
it
down
as
fact
,
that
Captain
Tilney
*NL*
must
have
heard
some
malevolent
misrepresentation
of
her
,
which
he
now
*NL*
hastened
to
communicate
to
his
brother
,
in
the
hope
of
separating
them
*NL*
forever
,
she
could
not
have
her
partner
conveyed
from
her
sight
without
*NL*
very
uneasy
sensations
.
Her
suspense
was
of
full
five
minutes
'
duration
;
*NL*
and
she
was
beginning
to
think
it
a
very
long
quarter
of
an
hour
,
when
*NL*
they
both
returned
,
and
an
explanation
was
given
,
by
Henry
's
requesting
*NL*
to
know
if
she
thought
her
friend
,
Miss
Thorpe
,
would
have
any
objection
*NL*
to
dancing
,
as
his
brother
would
be
most
happy
to
be
introduced
to
*NL*
her
.
Catherine
,
without
hesitation
,
replied
that
she
was
very
sure
Miss
*NL*
Thorpe
did
not
mean
to
dance
at
all
.
The
cruel
reply
was
passed
on
to
*NL*
the
other
,
and
he
immediately
walked
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
brother
will
not
mind
it
,
I
know
,
''
said
she
,
``
because
I
heard
him
*NL*
say
before
that
he
hated
dancing
;
but
it
was
very
good-natured
in
him
*NL*
to
think
of
it
.
I
suppose
he
saw
Isabella
sitting
down
,
and
fancied
she
*NL*
might
wish
for
a
partner
;
but
he
is
quite
mistaken
,
for
she
would
not
*NL*
dance
upon
any
account
in
the
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Henry
smiled
,
and
said
,
``
How
very
little
trouble
it
can
give
you
to
*NL*
understand
the
motive
of
other
people
's
actions
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
What
do
you
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
you
,
it
is
not
,
How
is
such
a
one
likely
to
be
influenced
,
What
*NL*
is
the
inducement
most
likely
to
act
upon
such
a
person
's
feelings
,
age
,
*NL*
situation
,
and
probable
habits
of
life
considered
--
but
,
How
should
I
be
*NL*
influenced
,
What
would
be
my
inducement
in
acting
so
and
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
understand
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
we
are
on
very
unequal
terms
,
for
I
understand
you
perfectly
*NL*
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Me
?
Yes
;
I
can
not
speak
well
enough
to
be
unintelligible
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bravo
!
An
excellent
satire
on
modern
language
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
pray
tell
me
what
you
mean
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
I
indeed
?
Do
you
really
desire
it
?
But
you
are
not
aware
of
the
*NL*
consequences
;
it
will
involve
you
in
a
very
cruel
embarrassment
,
and
*NL*
certainly
bring
on
a
disagreement
between
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
;
it
shall
not
do
either
;
I
am
not
afraid
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
I
only
meant
that
your
attributing
my
brother
's
wish
of
*NL*
dancing
with
Miss
Thorpe
to
good
nature
alone
convinced
me
of
your
being
*NL*
superior
in
good
nature
yourself
to
all
the
rest
of
the
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Catherine
blushed
and
disclaimed
,
and
the
gentleman
's
predictions
were
*NL*
verified
.
There
was
a
something
,
however
,
in
his
words
which
repaid
her
*NL*
for
the
pain
of
confusion
;
and
that
something
occupied
her
mind
so
much
*NL*
that
she
drew
back
for
some
time
,
forgetting
to
speak
or
to
listen
,
and
*NL*
almost
forgetting
where
she
was
;
till
,
roused
by
the
voice
of
Isabella
,
*NL*
she
looked
up
and
saw
her
with
Captain
Tilney
preparing
to
give
them
*NL*
hands
across
.
*NL*
*NL*
Isabella
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
smiled
,
the
only
explanation
of
this
*NL*
extraordinary
change
which
could
at
that
time
be
given
;
but
as
it
*NL*
was
not
quite
enough
for
Catherine
's
comprehension
,
she
spoke
her
*NL*
astonishment
in
very
plain
terms
to
her
partner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
think
how
it
could
happen
!
Isabella
was
so
determined
not
to
*NL*
dance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
did
Isabella
never
change
her
mind
before
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
But
,
because
--
And
your
brother
!
After
what
you
told
him
from
me
,
*NL*
how
could
he
think
of
going
to
ask
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
take
surprise
to
myself
on
that
head
.
You
bid
me
be
surprised
*NL*
on
your
friend
's
account
,
and
therefore
I
am
;
but
as
for
my
brother
,
his
*NL*
conduct
in
the
business
,
I
must
own
,
has
been
no
more
than
I
believed
*NL*
him
perfectly
equal
to
.
The
fairness
of
your
friend
was
an
open
*NL*
attraction
;
her
firmness
,
you
know
,
could
only
be
understood
by
*NL*
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
laughing
;
but
,
I
assure
you
,
Isabella
is
very
firm
in
general
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
as
much
as
should
be
said
of
anyone
.
To
be
always
firm
must
be
*NL*
to
be
often
obstinate
.
When
properly
to
relax
is
the
trial
of
judgment
;
*NL*
and
,
without
reference
to
my
brother
,
I
really
think
Miss
Thorpe
has
by
*NL*
no
means
chosen
ill
in
fixing
on
the
present
hour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
friends
were
not
able
to
get
together
for
any
confidential
discourse
*NL*
till
all
the
dancing
was
over
;
but
then
,
as
they
walked
about
the
room
*NL*
arm
in
arm
,
Isabella
thus
explained
herself
:
``
I
do
not
wonder
at
your
*NL*
surprise
;
and
I
am
really
fatigued
to
death
.
He
is
such
a
rattle
!
*NL*
Amusing
enough
,
if
my
mind
had
been
disengaged
;
but
I
would
have
given
*NL*
the
world
to
sit
still
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
why
did
not
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
My
dear
!
It
would
have
looked
so
particular
;
and
you
know
how
I
*NL*
abhor
doing
that
.
I
refused
him
as
long
as
I
possibly
could
,
but
he
*NL*
would
take
no
denial
.
You
have
no
idea
how
he
pressed
me
.
I
begged
him
*NL*
to
excuse
me
,
and
get
some
other
partner
--
but
no
,
not
he
;
after
aspiring
*NL*
to
my
hand
,
there
was
nobody
else
in
the
room
he
could
bear
to
think
of
;
*NL*
and
it
was
not
that
he
wanted
merely
to
dance
,
he
wanted
to
be
with
*NL*
me
.
Oh
!
Such
nonsense
!
I
told
him
he
had
taken
a
very
unlikely
way
to
*NL*
prevail
upon
me
;
for
,
of
all
things
in
the
world
,
I
hated
fine
speeches
*NL*
and
compliments
;
and
so
--
and
so
then
I
found
there
would
be
no
peace
if
*NL*
I
did
not
stand
up
.
Besides
,
I
thought
Mrs.
Hughes
,
who
introduced
him
,
*NL*
might
take
it
ill
if
I
did
not
:
and
your
dear
brother
,
I
am
sure
he
*NL*
would
have
been
miserable
if
I
had
sat
down
the
whole
evening
.
I
am
*NL*
so
glad
it
is
over
!
My
spirits
are
quite
jaded
with
listening
to
his
*NL*
nonsense
:
and
then
,
being
such
a
smart
young
fellow
,
I
saw
every
eye
was
*NL*
upon
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
very
handsome
indeed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Handsome
!
Yes
,
I
suppose
he
may
.
I
dare
say
people
would
admire
him
*NL*
in
general
;
but
he
is
not
at
all
in
my
style
of
beauty
.
I
hate
a
florid
*NL*
complexion
and
dark
eyes
in
a
man
.
However
,
he
is
very
well
.
Amazingly
*NL*
conceited
,
I
am
sure
.
I
took
him
down
several
times
,
you
know
,
in
my
*NL*
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
young
ladies
next
met
,
they
had
a
far
more
interesting
subject
*NL*
to
discuss
.
James
Morland
's
second
letter
was
then
received
,
and
the
*NL*
kind
intentions
of
his
father
fully
explained
.
A
living
,
of
which
Mr.
*NL*
Morland
was
himself
patron
and
incumbent
,
of
about
four
hundred
pounds
*NL*
yearly
value
,
was
to
be
resigned
to
his
son
as
soon
as
he
should
be
*NL*
old
enough
to
take
it
;
no
trifling
deduction
from
the
family
income
,
no
*NL*
niggardly
assignment
to
one
of
ten
children
.
An
estate
of
at
least
equal
*NL*
value
,
moreover
,
was
assured
as
his
future
inheritance
.
*NL*
*NL*
James
expressed
himself
on
the
occasion
with
becoming
gratitude
;
and
*NL*
the
necessity
of
waiting
between
two
and
three
years
before
they
could
*NL*
marry
,
being
,
however
unwelcome
,
no
more
than
he
had
expected
,
was
borne
*NL*
by
him
without
discontent
.
Catherine
,
whose
expectations
had
been
as
*NL*
unfixed
as
her
ideas
of
her
father
's
income
,
and
whose
judgment
was
now
*NL*
entirely
led
by
her
brother
,
felt
equally
well
satisfied
,
and
heartily
*NL*
congratulated
Isabella
on
having
everything
so
pleasantly
settled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
very
charming
indeed
,
''
said
Isabella
,
with
a
grave
face
.
``
Mr.
*NL*
Morland
has
behaved
vastly
handsome
indeed
,
''
said
the
gentle
Mrs.
*NL*
Thorpe
,
looking
anxiously
at
her
daughter
.
``
I
only
wish
I
could
do
as
*NL*
much

One
could
not
expect
more
from
him
,
you
know

If
he
finds
he
*NL*
can
do
more
by
and
by
,
I
dare
say
he
will
,
for
I
am
sure
he
must
be
an
*NL*
excellent
good-hearted
man
.
Four
hundred
is
but
a
small
income
to
begin
*NL*
on
indeed
,
but
your
wishes
,
my
dear
Isabella
,
are
so
moderate
,
you
do
*NL*
not
consider
how
little
you
ever
want

my
dear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
not
on
my
own
account
I
wish
for
more
;
but
I
can
not
bear
to
*NL*
be
the
means
of
injuring
my
dear
Morland
,
making
him
sit
down
upon
an
*NL*
income
hardly
enough
to
find
one
in
the
common
necessaries
of
life
.
For
*NL*
myself
,
it
is
nothing
;
I
never
think
of
myself

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
you
never
do

my
dear
;
and
you
will
always
find
your
reward
in
*NL*
the
affection
it
makes
everybody
feel
for
you
.
There
never
was
a
young
*NL*
woman
so
beloved
as
you
are
by
everybody
that
knows
you

and
I
dare
say
*NL*
when
Mr.
Morland
sees
you

my
dear
child

but
do
not
let
us
distress
*NL*
our
dear
Catherine
by
talking
of
such
things

Mr.
Morland
has
behaved
so
*NL*
very
handsome

you

I
always
heard
he
was
a
most
excellent
man

*NL*
and
you
know

my
dear
,
we
are
not
to
suppose

what
,
if
you
had
had
a
*NL*
suitable
fortune
,
he
would
have
come
down
with
something
more

sure
he
must
be
a
most
liberal-minded
man

*NL*
*NL*
``
Nobody
can
think
better
of
Mr.
Morland

I
do
,
I
am
sure

But
*NL*
everybody
has
their
failing
,
you
know
,
and
everybody
has
a
right
to
*NL*
do
what
they
like
with
their
own
money
.
''
Catherine
was
hurt
by
these
*NL*
insinuations
.
``
I
am
very
sure
,
''
said
she
,
``
that
my
father
has
promised
*NL*
to
do
as
much
as
he
can
afford

*NL*
*NL*
Isabella
recollected
herself
.
``
As
to
that
,
my
sweet
Catherine
,
there
*NL*
can
not
be
a
doubt
,
and
you
know
me
well
enough
to
be
sure
that
a
much
*NL*
smaller
income
would
satisfy
me
.
It
is
not
the
want
of
more
money
that
*NL*
makes
me
just
at
present
a
little
out
of
spirits
;
I
hate
money
;

if
*NL*
our
union
could
take
place
now
upon
only
fifty
pounds
a
year
,
I
should
*NL*
not
have
a
wish
unsatisfied

Ah
!
my
Catherine
,
you
have
found
me
out
.
*NL*
There
's
the
sting
.
The
long
,
long
,
endless
two
years
and
half
that
are
*NL*
to
pass
before
your
brother
can
hold
the
living

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

yes

my
darling
Isabella

said
Mrs.
Thorpe
,
``

perfectly
see

into
your

no

We
perfectly
understand
the

present
vexation

everybody
must
love
you
the
better
for
such
a
*NL*
noble
honest
affection
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Catherine
's
uncomfortable
feelings
began
to
lessen
.
She
endeavoured
to
*NL*
believe
that
the
delay
of
the
marriage
was
the
only
source
of
Isabella
's
*NL*
regret
;
and
when
she
saw
her
at
their
next
interview
as
cheerful
and
*NL*
amiable
as
ever
,
endeavoured
to
forget
that
she
had
for
a
minute
thought
*NL*
otherwise

James
soon
followed
his
letter

and
was
received
with
the
*NL*
most
gratifying
kindness

CHAPTER
17
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
Allens
had
now
entered
on
the
sixth
week
of
their
stay
in
Bath
;
and
*NL*
whether
it
should
be
the
last
was
for
some
time
a
question
,
to
which
*NL*
Catherine
listened
with
a
beating
heart
.
To
have
her
acquaintance
with
*NL*
the
Tilneys
end
so
soon
was
an
evil
which
nothing
could
counterbalance
.
*NL*
Her
whole
happiness
seemed
at
stake
,
while
the
affair
was
in
suspense
,
*NL*
and
everything
secured
when
it
was
determined
that
the
lodgings
should
*NL*
be
taken
for
another
fortnight
.
What
this
additional
fortnight
was
to
*NL*
produce
to
her
beyond
the
pleasure
of
sometimes
seeing
Henry
Tilney
made
*NL*
but
a
small
part
of
Catherine
's
speculation
.
Once
or
twice
indeed
,
since
*NL*
James
's
engagement
had
taught
her
what
could
be
done
,
she
had
got
so
*NL*
far
as
to
indulge
in
a
secret
``
perhaps
,
''
but
in
general
the
felicity
of
*NL*
being
with
him
for
the
present
bounded
her
views
:
the
present
was
now
*NL*
comprised
in
another
three
weeks
,
and
her
happiness
being
certain
for
*NL*
that
period
,
the
rest
of
her
life
was
at
such
a
distance
as
to
excite
*NL*
but
little
interest
.
In
the
course
of
the
morning
which
saw
this
*NL*
business
arranged
,
she
visited
Miss
Tilney
,
and
poured
forth
her
*NL*
joyful
feelings
.
It
was
doomed
to
be
a
day
of
trial
.
No
sooner
had
she
*NL*
expressed
her
delight
in
Mr.
Allen
's
lengthened
stay
than
Miss
Tilney
*NL*
told
her
of
her
father
's
having
just
determined
upon
quitting
Bath
*NL*
by
the
end
of
another
week
.
Here
was
a
blow
!
The
past
suspense
of
*NL*
the
morning
had
been
ease
and
quiet
to
the
present
disappointment
.
*NL*
Catherine
's
countenance
fell
,
and
in
a
voice
of
most
sincere
concern
she
*NL*
echoed
Miss
Tilney
's
concluding
words
,
``
By
the
end
of
another
week
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
my
father
can
seldom
be
prevailed
on
to
give
the
waters
what
I
*NL*
think
a
fair
trial
.
He
has
been
disappointed
of
some
friends
'
arrival
*NL*
whom
he
expected
to
meet
here
,
and
as
he
is
now
pretty
well
,
is
in
a
*NL*
hurry
to
get
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
sorry
for
it
,
''
said
Catherine
dejectedly
;
``
if
I
had
known
*NL*
this
before
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
,
''
said
Miss
Tilney
in
an
embarrassed
manner
,
``
you
would
be
so
*NL*
good
--
it
would
make
me
very
happy
if
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
entrance
of
her
father
put
a
stop
to
the
civility
,
which
Catherine
*NL*
was
beginning
to
hope
might
introduce
a
desire
of
their
corresponding
.
*NL*
After
addressing
her
with
his
usual
politeness
,
he
turned
to
his
*NL*
daughter
and
said
,
``
Well
,
Eleanor
,
may
I
congratulate
you
on
being
*NL*
successful
in
your
application
to
your
fair
friend
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
just
beginning
to
make
the
request
,
sir
,
as
you
came
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
proceed
by
all
means
.
I
know
how
much
your
heart
is
in
it
.
My
*NL*
daughter
,
Miss
Morland
,
''
he
continued
,
without
leaving
his
daughter
time
*NL*
to
speak
,
``
has
been
forming
a
very
bold
wish
.
We
leave
Bath
,
as
she
has
*NL*
perhaps
told
you
,
on
Saturday
se
`
nnight
.
A
letter
from
my
steward
tells
*NL*
me
that
my
presence
is
wanted
at
home
;
and
being
disappointed
in
my
hope
*NL*
of
seeing
the
Marquis
of
Longtown
and
General
Courteney
here
,
some
of
*NL*
my
very
old
friends
,
there
is
nothing
to
detain
me
longer
in
Bath
.
And
*NL*
could
we
carry
our
selfish
point
with
you
,
we
should
leave
it
without
a
*NL*
single
regret
.
Can
you
,
in
short
,
be
prevailed
on
to
quit
this
scene
*NL*
of
public
triumph
and
oblige
your
friend
Eleanor
with
your
company
in
*NL*
Gloucestershire
?
I
am
almost
ashamed
to
make
the
request
,
though
its
*NL*
presumption
would
certainly
appear
greater
to
every
creature
in
Bath
*NL*
than
yourself
.
Modesty
such
as
yours
--
but
not
for
the
world
would
I
pain
*NL*
it
by
open
praise
.
If
you
can
be
induced
to
honour
us
with
a
visit
,
*NL*
you
will
make
us
happy
beyond
expression
.
'T
is
true
,
we
can
offer
you
*NL*
nothing
like
the
gaieties
of
this
lively
place
;
we
can
tempt
you
neither
*NL*
by
amusement
nor
splendour
,
for
our
mode
of
living
,
as
you
see
,
is
plain
*NL*
and
unpretending
;
yet
no
endeavours
shall
be
wanting
on
our
side
to
make
*NL*
Northanger
Abbey
not
wholly
disagreeable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Northanger
Abbey
!
These
were
thrilling
words
,
and
wound
up
Catherine
's
*NL*
feelings
to
the
highest
point
of
ecstasy
.
Her
grateful
and
gratified
*NL*
heart
could
hardly
restrain
its
expressions
within
the
language
of
*NL*
tolerable
calmness
.
To
receive
so
flattering
an
invitation
!
To
have
her
*NL*
company
so
warmly
solicited
!
Everything
honourable
and
soothing
,
every
*NL*
present
enjoyment
,
and
every
future
hope
was
contained
in
it
;
and
her
*NL*
acceptance
,
with
only
the
saving
clause
of
Papa
and
Mamma
's
approbation
,
*NL*
was
eagerly
given
.
``
I
will
write
home
directly
,
''
said
she
,
``
and
if
they
*NL*
do
not
object
,
as
I
dare
say
they
will
not
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
General
Tilney
was
not
less
sanguine
,
having
already
waited
on
her
*NL*
excellent
friends
in
Pulteney
Street
,
and
obtained
their
sanction
of
*NL*
his
wishes
.
``
Since
they
can
consent
to
part
with
you
,
''
said
he
,
``
we
may
*NL*
expect
philosophy
from
all
the
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Tilney
was
earnest
,
though
gentle
,
in
her
secondary
civilities
,
and
*NL*
the
affair
became
in
a
few
minutes
as
nearly
settled
as
this
necessary
*NL*
reference
to
Fullerton
would
allow
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
circumstances
of
the
morning
had
led
Catherine
's
feelings
through
*NL*
the
varieties
of
suspense
,
security
,
and
disappointment
;
but
they
were
*NL*
now
safely
lodged
in
perfect
bliss
;
and
with
spirits
elated
to
rapture
,
*NL*
with
Henry
at
her
heart
,
and
Northanger
Abbey
on
her
lips
,
she
*NL*
hurried
home
to
write
her
letter
.
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Morland
,
relying
on
*NL*
the
discretion
of
the
friends
to
whom
they
had
already
entrusted
their
*NL*
daughter
,
felt
no
doubt
of
the
propriety
of
an
acquaintance
which
had
*NL*
been
formed
under
their
eye
,
and
sent
therefore
by
return
of
post
their
*NL*
ready
consent
to
her
visit
in
Gloucestershire
.
This
indulgence
,
though
*NL*
not
more
than
Catherine
had
hoped
for
,
completed
her
conviction
of
being
*NL*
favoured
beyond
every
other
human
creature
,
in
friends
and
fortune
,
*NL*
circumstance
and
chance
.
Everything
seemed
to
cooperate
for
her
*NL*
advantage
.
By
the
kindness
of
her
first
friends
,
the
Allens
,
she
had
*NL*
been
introduced
into
scenes
where
pleasures
of
every
kind
had
met
her
.
*NL*
Her
feelings
,
her
preferences
,
had
each
known
the
happiness
of
a
return
.
*NL*
Wherever
she
felt
attachment
,
she
had
been
able
to
create
it
.
The
*NL*
affection
of
Isabella
was
to
be
secured
to
her
in
a
sister
.
The
Tilneys
,
*NL*
they
,
by
whom
,
above
all
,
she
desired
to
be
favourably
thought
of
,
*NL*
outstripped
even
her
wishes
in
the
flattering
measures
by
which
their
*NL*
intimacy
was
to
be
continued
.
She
was
to
be
their
chosen
visitor
,
she
*NL*
was
to
be
for
weeks
under
the
same
roof
with
the
person
whose
society
*NL*
she
mostly
prized
--
and
,
in
addition
to
all
the
rest
,
this
roof
was
to
*NL*
be
the
roof
of
an
abbey
!
Her
passion
for
ancient
edifices
was
next
in
*NL*
degree
to
her
passion
for
Henry
Tilney
--
and
castles
and
abbeys
made
*NL*
usually
the
charm
of
those
reveries
which
his
image
did
not
fill
.
To
see
*NL*
and
explore
either
the
ramparts
and
keep
of
the
one
,
or
the
cloisters
*NL*
of
the
other
,
had
been
for
many
weeks
a
darling
wish
,
though
to
be
more
*NL*
than
the
visitor
of
an
hour
had
seemed
too
nearly
impossible
for
desire
.
*NL*
And
yet
,
this
was
to
happen
.
With
all
the
chances
against
her
of
house
,
*NL*
hall
,
place
,
park
,
court
,
and
cottage
,
Northanger
turned
up
an
abbey
,
*NL*
and
she
was
to
be
its
inhabitant
.
Its
long
,
damp
passages
,
its
narrow
*NL*
cells
and
ruined
chapel
,
were
to
be
within
her
daily
reach
,
and
she
*NL*
could
not
entirely
subdue
the
hope
of
some
traditional
legends
,
some
*NL*
awful
memorials
of
an
injured
and
ill-fated
nun
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
wonderful
that
her
friends
should
seem
so
little
elated
by
the
*NL*
possession
of
such
a
home
,
that
the
consciousness
of
it
should
be
so
*NL*
meekly
borne
.
The
power
of
early
habit
only
could
account
for
it
.
A
*NL*
distinction
to
which
they
had
been
born
gave
no
pride
.
Their
superiority
*NL*
of
abode
was
no
more
to
them
than
their
superiority
of
person
.
*NL*
*NL*
Many
were
the
inquiries
she
was
eager
to
make
of
Miss
Tilney
;
but
so
*NL*
active
were
her
thoughts
,
that
when
these
inquiries
were
answered
,
she
*NL*
was
hardly
more
assured
than
before
,
of
Northanger
Abbey
having
been
*NL*
a
richly
endowed
convent
at
the
time
of
the
Reformation
,
of
its
having
*NL*
fallen
into
the
hands
of
an
ancestor
of
the
Tilneys
on
its
dissolution
,
*NL*
of
a
large
portion
of
the
ancient
building
still
making
a
part
of
the
*NL*
present
dwelling
although
the
rest
was
decayed
,
or
of
its
standing
low
*NL*
in
a
valley
,
sheltered
from
the
north
and
east
by
rising
woods
of
oak
.

CHAPTER
18
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
With
a
mind
thus
full
of
happiness
,
Catherine
was
hardly
aware
that
two
*NL*
or
three
days
had
passed
away
,
without
her
seeing
Isabella
for
more
than
*NL*
a
few
minutes
together
.
She
began
first
to
be
sensible
of
this
,
and
*NL*
to
sigh
for
her
conversation
,
as
she
walked
along
the
pump-room
one
*NL*
morning
,
by
Mrs.
Allen
's
side
,
without
anything
to
say
or
to
hear
;
and
*NL*
scarcely
had
she
felt
a
five
minutes
'
longing
of
friendship
,
before
the
*NL*
object
of
it
appeared
,
and
inviting
her
to
a
secret
conference
,
led
the
*NL*
way
to
a
seat
.
``
This
is
my
favourite
place
,
''
said
she
as
they
sat
*NL*
down
on
a
bench
between
the
doors
,
which
commanded
a
tolerable
view
of
*NL*
everybody
entering
at
either
;
``
it
is
so
out
of
the
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Catherine
,
observing
that
Isabella
's
eyes
were
continually
bent
towards
*NL*
one
door
or
the
other
,
as
in
eager
expectation
,
and
remembering
how
*NL*
often
she
had
been
falsely
accused
of
being
arch
,
thought
the
present
a
*NL*
fine
opportunity
for
being
really
so
;
and
therefore
gaily
said
,
``
Do
not
*NL*
be
uneasy
,
Isabella
,
James
will
soon
be
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Psha
!
My
dear
creature
,
''
she
replied
,
``
do
not
think
me
such
a
simpleton
*NL*
as
to
be
always
wanting
to
confine
him
to
my
elbow
.
It
would
be
hideous
*NL*
to
be
always
together
;
we
should
be
the
jest
of
the
place
.
And
so
you
*NL*
are
going
to
Northanger
!
I
am
amazingly
glad
of
it
.
It
is
one
of
the
*NL*
finest
old
places
in
England
,
I
understand
.
I
shall
depend
upon
a
most
*NL*
particular
description
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
shall
certainly
have
the
best
in
my
power
to
give
.
But
who
are
you
*NL*
looking
for
?
Are
your
sisters
coming
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
looking
for
anybody
.
One
's
eyes
must
be
somewhere
,
and
you
*NL*
know
what
a
foolish
trick
I
have
of
fixing
mine
,
when
my
thoughts
are
an
*NL*
hundred
miles
off
.
I
am
amazingly
absent
;
I
believe
I
am
the
most
absent
*NL*
creature
in
the
world
.
Tilney
says
it
is
always
the
case
with
minds
of
a
*NL*
certain
stamp
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
thought
,
Isabella
,
you
had
something
in
particular
to
tell
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
Yes
,
and
so
I
have
.
But
here
is
a
proof
of
what
I
was
saying
.
My
*NL*
poor
head
,
I
had
quite
forgot
it
.
Well
,
the
thing
is
this
:
I
have
just
*NL*
had
a
letter
from
John
;
you
can
guess
the
contents
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
indeed
,
I
can
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
sweet
love
,
do
not
be
so
abominably
affected
.
What
can
he
write
*NL*
about
,
but
yourself
?
You
know
he
is
over
head
and
ears
in
love
with
*NL*
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
me
,
dear
Isabella
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
my
sweetest
Catherine
,
this
is
being
quite
absurd
!
Modesty
,
and
*NL*
all
that
,
is
very
well
in
its
way
,
but
really
a
little
common
honesty
is
*NL*
sometimes
quite
as
becoming
.
I
have
no
idea
of
being
so
overstrained
!
*NL*
It
is
fishing
for
compliments
.
His
attentions
were
such
as
a
child
must
*NL*
have
noticed
.
And
it
was
but
half
an
hour
before
he
left
Bath
that
you
*NL*
gave
him
the
most
positive
encouragement
.
He
says
so
in
this
letter
,
*NL*
says
that
he
as
good
as
made
you
an
offer
,
and
that
you
received
his
*NL*
advances
in
the
kindest
way
;
and
now
he
wants
me
to
urge
his
suit
,
*NL*
and
say
all
manner
of
pretty
things
to
you
.
So
it
is
in
vain
to
affect
*NL*
ignorance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Catherine
,
with
all
the
earnestness
of
truth
,
expressed
her
astonishment
*NL*
at
such
a
charge
,
protesting
her
innocence
of
every
thought
of
Mr.
*NL*
Thorpe
's
being
in
love
with
her
,
and
the
consequent
impossibility
of
*NL*
her
having
ever
intended
to
encourage
him
.
``
As
to
any
attentions
on
his
*NL*
side
,
I
do
declare
,
upon
my
honour
,
I
never
was
sensible
of
them
for
a
*NL*
moment
--
except
just
his
asking
me
to
dance
the
first
day
of
his
coming
.
*NL*
And
as
to
making
me
an
offer
,
or
anything
like
it
,
there
must
be
some
*NL*
unaccountable
mistake
.
I
could
not
have
misunderstood
a
thing
of
that
*NL*
kind
,
you
know
!
And
,
as
I
ever
wish
to
be
believed
,
I
solemnly
protest
*NL*
that
no
syllable
of
such
a
nature
ever
passed
between
us
.
The
last
half
*NL*
hour
before
he
went
away
!
It
must
be
all
and
completely
a
mistake
--
for
I
*NL*
did
not
see
him
once
that
whole
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
that
you
certainly
did
,
for
you
spent
the
whole
morning
in
Edgar
's
*NL*
Buildings
--
it
was
the
day
your
father
's
consent
came
--
and
I
am
pretty
*NL*
sure
that
you
and
John
were
alone
in
the
parlour
some
time
before
you
*NL*
left
the
house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
?
Well
,
if
you
say
it
,
it
was
so
,
I
dare
say
--
but
for
the
life
*NL*
of
me
,
I
can
not
recollect
it
.
I
do
remember
now
being
with
you
,
and
*NL*
seeing
him
as
well
as
the
rest
--
but
that
we
were
ever
alone
for
five
*NL*
minutes
--
However
,
it
is
not
worth
arguing
about
,
for
whatever
might
pass
*NL*
on
his
side
,
you
must
be
convinced
,
by
my
having
no
recollection
of
it
,
*NL*
that
I
never
thought
,
nor
expected
,
nor
wished
for
anything
of
the
kind
*NL*
from
him
.
I
am
excessively
concerned
that
he
should
have
any
regard
for
*NL*
me
--
but
indeed
it
has
been
quite
unintentional
on
my
side
;
I
never
had
*NL*
the
smallest
idea
of
it
.
Pray
undeceive
him
as
soon
as
you
can
,
and
tell
*NL*
him
I
beg
his
pardon
--
that
is
--
I
do
not
know
what
I
ought
to
say
--
but
*NL*
make
him
understand
what
I
mean
,
in
the
properest
way
.
I
would
not
speak
*NL*
disrespectfully
of
a
brother
of
yours
,
Isabella
,
I
am
sure
;
but
you
know
*NL*
very
well
that
if
I
could
think
of
one
man
more
than
another
--
he
is
not
*NL*
the
person
.
''
Isabella
was
silent
.
``
My
dear
friend
,
you
must
not
be
angry
*NL*
with
me
.
I
can
not
suppose
your
brother
cares
so
very
much
about
me
.
And
,
*NL*
you
know
,
we
shall
still
be
sisters
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes

-LRB-
with
a
blush
-RRB-
,
``
there
are
more
ways
than
one
of
our
being
*NL*
sisters
.
But
where
am
I
wandering
to
?
Well
,
my
dear
Catherine
,
the
case
*NL*
seems
to
be
that
you
are
determined
against
poor
John
--
is
not
it
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
certainly
can
not
return
his
affection
,
and
as
certainly
never
meant
*NL*
to
encourage
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Since
that
is
the
case
,
I
am
sure
I
shall
not
tease
you
any
further
.
*NL*
John
desired
me
to
speak
to
you
on
the
subject
,
and
therefore
I
have
.
*NL*
But
I
confess
,
as
soon
as
I
read
his
letter
,
I
thought
it
a
very
*NL*
foolish
,
imprudent
business
,
and
not
likely
to
promote
the
good
of
*NL*
either
;
for
what
were
you
to
live
upon
,
supposing
you
came
together
?
You
*NL*
have
both
of
you
something
,
to
be
sure
,
but
it
is
not
a
trifle
that
will
*NL*
support
a
family
nowadays
;
and
after
all
that
romancers
may
say
,
there
*NL*
is
no
doing
without
money
.
I
only
wonder
John
could
think
of
it
;
he
*NL*
could
not
have
received
my
last
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
acquit
me
,
then
,
of
anything
wrong
?
--
You
are
convinced
that
I
*NL*
never
meant
to
deceive
your
brother
,
never
suspected
him
of
liking
me
*NL*
till
this
moment
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
As
to
that
,
''
answered
Isabella
laughingly
,
``
I
do
not
pretend
to
*NL*
determine
what
your
thoughts
and
designs
in
time
past
may
have
been

All
*NL*
that
is
best
known
to
yourself
.
A
little
harmless
flirtation
or
so
will
*NL*
occur
,
and
one
is
often
drawn
on
to
give
more
encouragement
than
one
*NL*
wishes
to
stand
by
.
But
you
may
be
assured
that
I
am
the
last
person
in
*NL*
the
world
to
judge
you
severely
.
All
those
things
should
be
allowed
for
*NL*
in
youth
and
high
spirits
.
What
one
means
one
day
,
you
know
,
one
may
not
*NL*
mean
the
next
.
Circumstances
change
,
opinions
alter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
my
opinion
of
your
brother
never
did
alter
;
it
was
always
the
same
.
*NL*
You
are
describing
what
never
happened
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dearest
Catherine
,
''
continued
the
other
without
at
all
listening
to
*NL*
her
,
``
I
would
not
for
all
the
world
be
the
means
of
hurrying
you
into
an
*NL*
engagement
before
you
knew
what
you
were
about
.
I
do
not
think
anything
*NL*
would
justify
me
in
wishing
you
to
sacrifice
all
your
happiness
merely
*NL*
to
oblige
my
brother
,
because
he
is
my
brother
,
and
who
perhaps
after
*NL*
all
,
you
know
,
might
be
just
as
happy
without
you
,
for
people
seldom
*NL*
know
what
they
would
be
at
,
young
men
especially
,
they
are
so
amazingly
*NL*
changeable
and
inconstant
.
What
I
say
is
,
why
should
a
brother
's
*NL*
happiness
be
dearer
to
me
than
a
friend
's
?
You
know
I
carry
my
notions
*NL*
of
friendship
pretty
high
.
But
,
above
all
things
,
my
dear
Catherine
,
do
*NL*
not
be
in
a
hurry

Take
my
word
for
it
,
that
if
you
are
in
too
great
*NL*
a
hurry
,
you
will
certainly
live
to
repent
it

Tilney
says
there
is
*NL*
nothing
people
are
so
often
deceived
in
as
the
state
of
their
own
*NL*
affections
,
and
I
believe
he
is
very
right
.
Ah
!
Here
he
comes
;
never
*NL*
mind
,
he
will
not
see
us
,
I
am
sure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Catherine
,
looking
up
,
perceived
Captain
Tilney
;
and
Isabella
,
*NL*
earnestly
fixing
her
eye
on
him
as
she
spoke
,
soon
caught
his
notice
.
He
*NL*
approached
immediately
,
and
took
the
seat
to
which
her
movements
invited
*NL*
him
.
His
first
address
made
Catherine
start
.
Though
spoken
low
,
she
*NL*
could
distinguish
,
``
What
!
Always
to
be
watched
,
in
person
or
by
proxy
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Psha
,
nonsense
!
''
was
Isabella
's
answer
in
the
same
half
whisper
.
``
Why
*NL*
do
you
put
such
things
into
my
head
?
If
I
could
believe
it
--
my
spirit
,
*NL*
you
know
,
is
pretty
independent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
your
heart
were
independent

That
would
be
enough
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
heart
,
indeed
!
What
can
you
have
to
do
with
hearts
?
You
men
have
*NL*
none
of
you
any
hearts

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
we
have
not
hearts

we
have
eyes

and
they
give
us
torment
enough
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
they
?
I
am
sorry
for
it
;
I
am
sorry
they
find
anything
so
*NL*
disagreeable
in
me
.
I
will
look
another
way
.
I
hope
this
pleases
you
''
*NL*
-LRB-
turning
her
back
on
him
-RRB-
;
``
I
hope
your
eyes
are
not
tormented
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
more
so
;
for
the
edge
of
a
blooming
cheek
is
still
in
view
--
at
*NL*
once
too
much
and
too
little
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Catherine
heard
all
this
,
and
quite
out
of
countenance
,
could
listen
*NL*
no
longer
.
Amazed
that
Isabella
could
endure
it
,
and
jealous
for
her
*NL*
brother
,
she
rose
up
,
and
saying
she
should
join
Mrs.
Allen
,
proposed
*NL*
their
walking
.
But
for
this
Isabella
showed
no
inclination
.
She
was
so
*NL*
amazingly
tired
,
and
it
was
so
odious
to
parade
about
the
pump-room
;
*NL*
and
if
she
moved
from
her
seat
she
should
miss
her
sisters
;
she
was
*NL*
expecting
her
sisters
every
moment
;
so
that
her
dearest
Catherine
must
*NL*
excuse
her
,
and
must
sit
quietly
down
again
.
But
Catherine
could
be
*NL*
stubborn
too
;
and
Mrs.
Allen
just
then
coming
up
to
propose
their
*NL*
returning
home
,
she
joined
her
and
walked
out
of
the
pump-room
,
leaving
*NL*
Isabella
still
sitting
with
Captain
Tilney
.
With
much
uneasiness
did
*NL*
she
thus
leave
them
.
It
seemed
to
her
that
Captain
Tilney
was
falling
*NL*
in
love
with
Isabella
,
and
Isabella
unconsciously
encouraging
him
;
*NL*
unconsciously
it
must
be
,
for
Isabella
's
attachment
to
James
was
as
*NL*
certain
and
well
acknowledged
as
her
engagement
.
To
doubt
her
truth
*NL*
or
good
intentions
was
impossible
;
and
yet
,
during
the
whole
of
their
*NL*
conversation
her
manner
had
been
odd
.
She
wished
Isabella
had
talked
*NL*
more
like
her
usual
self
,
and
not
so
much
about
money
,
and
had
not
*NL*
looked
so
well
pleased
at
the
sight
of
Captain
Tilney
.
How
strange
that
*NL*
she
should
not
perceive
his
admiration
!
Catherine
longed
to
give
her
a
*NL*
hint
of
it
,
to
put
her
on
her
guard
,
and
prevent
all
the
pain
which
*NL*
her
too
lively
behaviour
might
otherwise
create
both
for
him
and
her
*NL*
brother
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
compliment
of
John
Thorpe
's
affection
did
not
make
amends
for
this
*NL*
thoughtlessness
in
his
sister
.
She
was
almost
as
far
from
believing
as
*NL*
from
wishing
it
to
be
sincere
;
for
she
had
not
forgotten
that
he
*NL*
could
mistake
,
and
his
assertion
of
the
offer
and
of
her
encouragement
*NL*
convinced
her
that
his
mistakes
could
sometimes
be
very
egregious
.
*NL*
In
vanity
,
therefore
,
she
gained
but
little
;
her
chief
profit
was
in
*NL*
wonder
.
That
he
should
think
it
worth
his
while
to
fancy
himself
in
love
*NL*
with
her
was
a
matter
of
lively
astonishment
.
Isabella
talked
of
his
*NL*
attentions
;
she
had
never
been
sensible
of
any
;
but
Isabella
had
said
*NL*
many
things
which
she
hoped
had
been
spoken
in
haste
,
and
would
never
*NL*
be
said
again
;
and
upon
this
she
was
glad
to
rest
altogether
for
present
*NL*
ease
and
comfort
.

CHAPTER
19
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
days
passed
away
,
and
Catherine
,
though
not
allowing
herself
to
*NL*
suspect
her
friend
,
could
not
help
watching
her
closely
.
The
result
of
*NL*
her
observations
was
not
agreeable
.
Isabella
seemed
an
altered
creature
.
*NL*
When
she
saw
her
,
indeed
,
surrounded
only
by
their
immediate
friends
*NL*
in
Edgar
's
Buildings
or
Pulteney
Street
,
her
change
of
manners
was
so
*NL*
trifling
that
,
had
it
gone
no
farther
,
it
might
have
passed
unnoticed
.
*NL*
A
something
of
languid
indifference
,
or
of
that
boasted
absence
of
*NL*
mind
which
Catherine
had
never
heard
of
before
,
would
occasionally
come
*NL*
across
her
;
but
had
nothing
worse
appeared
,
that
might
only
have
spread
*NL*
a
new
grace
and
inspired
a
warmer
interest
.
But
when
Catherine
saw
her
*NL*
in
public
,
admitting
Captain
Tilney
's
attentions
as
readily
as
they
were
*NL*
offered
,
and
allowing
him
almost
an
equal
share
with
James
in
her
notice
*NL*
and
smiles
,
the
alteration
became
too
positive
to
be
passed
over
.
What
*NL*
could
be
meant
by
such
unsteady
conduct
,
what
her
friend
could
be
at
,
*NL*
was
beyond
her
comprehension
.
Isabella
could
not
be
aware
of
the
pain
*NL*
she
was
inflicting
;
but
it
was
a
degree
of
wilful
thoughtlessness
which
*NL*
Catherine
could
not
but
resent
.
James
was
the
sufferer
.
She
saw
him
*NL*
grave
and
uneasy
;
and
however
careless
of
his
present
comfort
the
woman
*NL*
might
be
who
had
given
him
her
heart
,
to
her
it
was
always
an
object
.
*NL*
For
poor
Captain
Tilney
too
she
was
greatly
concerned
.
Though
his
looks
*NL*
did
not
please
her
,
his
name
was
a
passport
to
her
goodwill
,
and
she
*NL*
thought
with
sincere
compassion
of
his
approaching
disappointment
;
for
,
*NL*
in
spite
of
what
she
had
believed
herself
to
overhear
in
the
pump-room
,
*NL*
his
behaviour
was
so
incompatible
with
a
knowledge
of
Isabella
's
*NL*
engagement
that
she
could
not
,
upon
reflection
,
imagine
him
aware
of
it
.
*NL*
He
might
be
jealous
of
her
brother
as
a
rival
,
but
if
more
had
seemed
*NL*
implied
,
the
fault
must
have
been
in
her
misapprehension
.
She
wished
,
by
*NL*
a
gentle
remonstrance
,
to
remind
Isabella
of
her
situation
,
and
make
*NL*
her
aware
of
this
double
unkindness
;
but
for
remonstrance
,
either
*NL*
opportunity
or
comprehension
was
always
against
her
.
If
able
to
suggest
*NL*
a
hint
,
Isabella
could
never
understand
it
.
In
this
distress
,
the
*NL*
intended
departure
of
the
Tilney
family
became
her
chief
consolation
;
*NL*
their
journey
into
Gloucestershire
was
to
take
place
within
a
few
days
,
*NL*
and
Captain
Tilney
's
removal
would
at
least
restore
peace
to
every
heart
*NL*
but
his
own
.
But
Captain
Tilney
had
at
present
no
intention
of
removing
;
*NL*
he
was
not
to
be
of
the
party
to
Northanger
;
he
was
to
continue
at
Bath
.
*NL*
When
Catherine
knew
this
,
her
resolution
was
directly
made
.
She
spoke
to
*NL*
Henry
Tilney
on
the
subject
,
regretting
his
brother
's
evident
partiality
*NL*
for
Miss
Thorpe
,
and
entreating
him
to
make
known
her
prior
engagement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
brother
does
know
it
,
''
was
Henry
's
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
he
?
Then
why
does
he
stay
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
made
no
reply
,
and
was
beginning
to
talk
of
something
else
;
but
she
*NL*
eagerly
continued
,
``
Why
do
not
you
persuade
him
to
go
away
?
The
longer
*NL*
he
stays
,
the
worse
it
will
be
for
him
at
last
.
Pray
advise
him
for
his
*NL*
own
sake
,
and
for
everybody
's
sake
,
to
leave
Bath
directly
.
Absence
will
*NL*
in
time
make
him
comfortable
again
;
but
he
can
have
no
hope
here
,
and
it
*NL*
is
only
staying
to
be
miserable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Henry
smiled
and
said
,
``
I
am
sure
my
brother
would
not
wish
to
do
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
will
persuade
him
to
go
away
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Persuasion
is
not
at
command
;
but
pardon
me
,
if
I
can
not
even
endeavour
*NL*
to
persuade
him
.
I
have
myself
told
him
that
Miss
Thorpe
is
engaged
.
He
*NL*
knows
what
he
is
about
,
and
must
be
his
own
master
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
he
does
not
know
what
he
is
about
,
''
cried
Catherine
;
``
he
does
not
*NL*
know
the
pain
he
is
giving
my
brother
.
Not
that
James
has
ever
told
me
*NL*
so
,
but
I
am
sure
he
is
very
uncomfortable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
are
you
sure
it
is
my
brother
's
doing
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
very
sure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
my
brother
's
attentions
to
Miss
Thorpe
,
or
Miss
Thorpe
's
*NL*
admission
of
them
,
that
gives
the
pain
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
not
it
the
same
thing
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
Mr.
Morland
would
acknowledge
a
difference
.
No
man
is
offended
*NL*
by
another
man
's
admiration
of
the
woman
he
loves
;
it
is
the
woman
only
*NL*
who
can
make
it
a
torment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Catherine
blushed
for
her
friend
,
and
said
,
``
Isabella
is
wrong
.
But
I
*NL*
am
sure
she
can
not
mean
to
torment
,
for
she
is
very
much
attached
to
my
*NL*
brother
.
She
has
been
in
love
with
him
ever
since
they
first
met
,
and
*NL*
while
my
father
's
consent
was
uncertain
,
she
fretted
herself
almost
into
*NL*
a
fever
.
You
know
she
must
be
attached
to
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
understand
:
she
is
in
love
with
James
,
and
flirts
with
Frederick
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
no
,
not
flirts
.
A
woman
in
love
with
one
man
can
not
flirt
with
*NL*
another
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
probable
that
she
will
neither
love
so
well
,
nor
flirt
so
*NL*
well
,
as
she
might
do
either
singly
.
The
gentlemen
must
each
give
up
a
*NL*
little
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
short
pause
,
Catherine
resumed
with
,
``
Then
you
do
not
believe
*NL*
Isabella
so
very
much
attached
to
my
brother
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
have
no
opinion
on
that
subject
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
can
your
brother
mean
?
If
he
knows
her
engagement
,
what
can
he
*NL*
mean
by
his
behaviour
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
a
very
close
questioner

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Am
I

I
only
ask

I

*NL*

ask

I

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

I
think
so
;
for
you
must
know
your

heart

*NL*
*NL*
``
My
brother

heart
,
as
you
term
it
,
on
the
present
occasion

I
assure
*NL*
you
I
can
only
guess
at
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
Nay
,
if
it
is
to
be
guesswork
,
let
us
all
guess
for
ourselves
.
To
*NL*
be
guided
by
second-hand
conjecture
is
pitiful
.
The
premises
are
before
*NL*
you
.
My
brother
is
a
lively
and
perhaps
sometimes
a
thoughtless
young
*NL*
man
;
he
has
had
about
a
week
's
acquaintance
with
your
friend
,
and
he
has
*NL*
known
her
engagement
almost
as
long
as
he
has
known
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Catherine
,
after
some
moments
'
consideration
,
``
you
may
be
*NL*
able
to
guess
at
your
brother
's
intentions
from
all
this
;
but
I
am
sure
*NL*
I
can
not
.
But
is
not
your
father
uncomfortable
about
it
?
Does
not
he
*NL*
want
Captain
Tilney
to
go
away
?
Sure
,
if
your
father
were
to
speak
to
*NL*
him
,
he
would
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Miss
Morland
,
''
said
Henry
,
``
in
this
amiable
solicitude
for
your
*NL*
brother
's
comfort
,
may
you
not
be
a
little
mistaken
?
Are
you
not
carried
*NL*
a
little
too
far
?
Would
he
thank
you
,
either
on
his
own
account
or
*NL*
Miss
Thorpe
's
,
for
supposing
that
her
affection
,
or
at
least
her
good
*NL*
behaviour
,
is
only
to
be
secured
by
her
seeing
nothing
of
Captain
*NL*
Tilney
?
Is
he
safe
only
in
solitude
?
Or
is
her
heart
constant
to
him
*NL*
only
when
unsolicited
by
anyone
else
?
He
can
not
think
this
--
and
you
may
*NL*
be
sure
that
he
would
not
have
you
think
it
.
I
will
not
say
,
`
Do
not
*NL*
be
uneasy
,
'
because
I
know
that
you
are
so
,
at
this
moment
;
but
be
as
*NL*
little
uneasy
as
you
can
.
You
have
no
doubt
of
the
mutual
attachment
*NL*
of
your
brother
and
your
friend
;
depend
upon
it
,
therefore
,
that
*NL*
real
jealousy
never
can
exist
between
them
;
depend
upon
it
that
no
*NL*
disagreement
between
them
can
be
of
any
duration
.
Their
hearts
are
open
*NL*
to
each
other
,
as
neither
heart
can
be
to
you
;
they
know
exactly
what
*NL*
is
required
and
what
can
be
borne
;
and
you
may
be
certain
that
one
will
*NL*
never
tease
the
other
beyond
what
is
known
to
be
pleasant
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Perceiving
her
still
to
look
doubtful
and
grave
,
he
added
,
``
Though
*NL*
Frederick
does
not
leave
Bath
with
us
,
he
will
probably
remain
but
a
*NL*
very
short
time
,
perhaps
only
a
few
days
behind
us
.
His
leave
of
absence
*NL*
will
soon
expire
,
and
he
must
return
to
his
regiment
.
And
what
will
then
*NL*
be
their
acquaintance
?
The
mess-room
will
drink
Isabella
Thorpe
for
*NL*
a
fortnight
,
and
she
will
laugh
with
your
brother
over
poor
Tilney
's
*NL*
passion
for
a
month
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Catherine
would
contend
no
longer
against
comfort
.
She
had
resisted
its
*NL*
approaches
during
the
whole
length
of
a
speech
,
but
it
now
carried
her
*NL*
captive
.
Henry
Tilney
must
know
best
.
She
blamed
herself
for
the
extent
*NL*
of
her
fears
,
and
resolved
never
to
think
so
seriously
on
the
subject
*NL*
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
resolution
was
supported
by
Isabella
's
behaviour
in
their
parting
*NL*
interview
.
The
Thorpes
spent
the
last
evening
of
Catherine
's
stay
in
*NL*
Pulteney
Street
,
and
nothing
passed
between
the
lovers
to
excite
*NL*
her
uneasiness
,
or
make
her
quit
them
in
apprehension
.
James
was
in
*NL*
excellent
spirits
,
and
Isabella
most
engagingly
placid
.
Her
tenderness
*NL*
for
her
friend
seemed
rather
the
first
feeling
of
her
heart
;
but
that
*NL*
at
such
a
moment
was
allowable
;
and
once
she
gave
her
lover
a
flat
*NL*
contradiction
,
and
once
she
drew
back
her
hand
;
but
Catherine
remembered
*NL*
Henry
's
instructions
,
and
placed
it
all
to
judicious
affection
.
The
*NL*
embraces
,
tears
,
and
promises
of
the
parting
fair
ones
may
be
fancied
.

CHAPTER
20
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Allen
were
sorry
to
lose
their
young
friend
,
whose
good
*NL*
humour
and
cheerfulness
had
made
her
a
valuable
companion
,
and
in
the
*NL*
promotion
of
whose
enjoyment
their
own
had
been
gently
increased
.
Her
*NL*
happiness
in
going
with
Miss
Tilney
,
however
,
prevented
their
wishing
*NL*
it
otherwise
;
and
,
as
they
were
to
remain
only
one
more
week
in
Bath
*NL*
themselves
,
her
quitting
them
now
would
not
long
be
felt
.
Mr.
Allen
*NL*
attended
her
to
Milsom
Street
,
where
she
was
to
breakfast
,
and
saw
her
*NL*
seated
with
the
kindest
welcome
among
her
new
friends
;
but
so
great
was
*NL*
her
agitation
in
finding
herself
as
one
of
the
family
,
and
so
fearful
*NL*
was
she
of
not
doing
exactly
what
was
right
,
and
of
not
being
able
to
*NL*
preserve
their
good
opinion
,
that
,
in
the
embarrassment
of
the
first
*NL*
five
minutes
,
she
could
almost
have
wished
to
return
with
him
to
*NL*
Pulteney
Street
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Tilney
's
manners
and
Henry
's
smile
soon
did
away
some
of
her
*NL*
unpleasant
feelings
;
but
still
she
was
far
from
being
at
ease
;
nor
could
*NL*
the
incessant
attentions
of
the
general
himself
entirely
reassure
her
.
*NL*
Nay
,
perverse
as
it
seemed
,
she
doubted
whether
she
might
not
have
felt
*NL*
less
,
had
she
been
less
attended
to
.
His
anxiety
for
her
comfort
--
his
*NL*
continual
solicitations
that
she
would
eat
,
and
his
often-expressed
*NL*
fears
of
her
seeing
nothing
to
her
taste
--
though
never
in
her
life
*NL*
before
had
she
beheld
half
such
variety
on
a
breakfast-table
--
made
it
*NL*
impossible
for
her
to
forget
for
a
moment
that
she
was
a
visitor
.
She
*NL*
felt
utterly
unworthy
of
such
respect
,
and
knew
not
how
to
reply
to
it
.
*NL*
Her
tranquillity
was
not
improved
by
the
general
's
impatience
for
the
*NL*
appearance
of
his
eldest
son
,
nor
by
the
displeasure
he
expressed
at
his
*NL*
laziness
when
Captain
Tilney
at
last
came
down
.
She
was
quite
pained
by
*NL*
the
severity
of
his
father
's
reproof
,
which
seemed
disproportionate
to
*NL*
the
offence
;
and
much
was
her
concern
increased
when
she
found
herself
*NL*
the
principal
cause
of
the
lecture
,
and
that
his
tardiness
was
chiefly
*NL*
resented
from
being
disrespectful
to
her
.
This
was
placing
her
in
a
*NL*
very
uncomfortable
situation
,
and
she
felt
great
compassion
for
Captain
*NL*
Tilney
,
without
being
able
to
hope
for
his
goodwill
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
listened
to
his
father
in
silence
,
and
attempted
not
any
defence
,
*NL*
which
confirmed
her
in
fearing
that
the
inquietude
of
his
mind
,
on
*NL*
Isabella
's
account
,
might
,
by
keeping
him
long
sleepless
,
have
been
*NL*
the
real
cause
of
his
rising
late
.
It
was
the
first
time
of
her
being
*NL*
decidedly
in
his
company
,
and
she
had
hoped
to
be
now
able
to
form
*NL*
her
opinion
of
him
;
but
she
scarcely
heard
his
voice
while
his
father
*NL*
remained
in
the
room
;
and
even
afterwards
,
so
much
were
his
spirits
*NL*
affected
,
she
could
distinguish
nothing
but
these
words
,
in
a
whisper
to
*NL*
Eleanor
,
``
How
glad
I
shall
be
when
you
are
all
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
bustle
of
going
was
not
pleasant
.
The
clock
struck
ten
while
the
*NL*
trunks
were
carrying
down
,
and
the
general
had
fixed
to
be
out
of
Milsom
*NL*
Street
by
that
hour
.
His
greatcoat
,
instead
of
being
brought
for
him
*NL*
to
put
on
directly
,
was
spread
out
in
the
curricle
in
which
he
was
to
*NL*
accompany
his
son
.
The
middle
seat
of
the
chaise
was
not
drawn
out
,
*NL*
though
there
were
three
people
to
go
in
it
,
and
his
daughter
's
maid
had
*NL*
so
crowded
it
with
parcels
that
Miss
Morland
would
not
have
room
to
sit
;
*NL*
and
,
so
much
was
he
influenced
by
this
apprehension
when
he
handed
her
*NL*
in
,
that
she
had
some
difficulty
in
saving
her
own
new
writing-desk
from
*NL*
being
thrown
out
into
the
street
.
At
last
,
however
,
the
door
was
closed
*NL*
upon
the
three
females
,
and
they
set
off
at
the
sober
pace
in
which
*NL*
the
handsome
,
highly
fed
four
horses
of
a
gentleman
usually
perform
a
*NL*
journey
of
thirty
miles
:
such
was
the
distance
of
Northanger
from
Bath
,
*NL*
to
be
now
divided
into
two
equal
stages
.
Catherine
's
spirits
revived
as
*NL*
they
drove
from
the
door
;
for
with
Miss
Tilney
she
felt
no
restraint
;
*NL*
and
,
with
the
interest
of
a
road
entirely
new
to
her
,
of
an
abbey
*NL*
before
,
and
a
curricle
behind
,
she
caught
the
last
view
of
Bath
without
*NL*
any
regret
,
and
met
with
every
milestone
before
she
expected
it
.
The
*NL*
tediousness
of
a
two
hours
'
wait
at
Petty
France
,
in
which
there
was
*NL*
nothing
to
be
done
but
to
eat
without
being
hungry
,
and
loiter
about
*NL*
without
anything
to
see
,
next
followed
--
and
her
admiration
of
the
style
*NL*
in
which
they
travelled
,
of
the
fashionable
chaise
and
four
--
postilions
*NL*
handsomely
liveried
,
rising
so
regularly
in
their
stirrups
,
and
*NL*
numerous
outriders
properly
mounted
,
sunk
a
little
under
this
consequent
*NL*
inconvenience
.
Had
their
party
been
perfectly
agreeable
,
the
delay
would
*NL*
have
been
nothing
;
but
General
Tilney
,
though
so
charming
a
man
,
seemed
*NL*
always
a
check
upon
his
children
's
spirits
,
and
scarcely
anything
was
*NL*
said
but
by
himself
;
the
observation
of
which
,
with
his
discontent
at
*NL*
whatever
the
inn
afforded
,
and
his
angry
impatience
at
the
waiters
,
made
*NL*
Catherine
grow
every
moment
more
in
awe
of
him
,
and
appeared
to
lengthen
*NL*
the
two
hours
into
four
.
At
last
,
however
,
the
order
of
release
was
*NL*
given
;
and
much
was
Catherine
then
surprised
by
the
general
's
proposal
*NL*
of
her
taking
his
place
in
his
son
's
curricle
for
the
rest
of
the
*NL*
journey
:
``
the
day
was
fine
,
and
he
was
anxious
for
her
seeing
as
much
of
*NL*
the
country
as
possible
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
remembrance
of
Mr.
Allen
's
opinion
,
respecting
young
men
's
open
*NL*
carriages
,
made
her
blush
at
the
mention
of
such
a
plan
,
and
her
first
*NL*
thought
was
to
decline
it
;
but
her
second
was
of
greater
deference
for
*NL*
General
Tilney
's
judgment
;
he
could
not
propose
anything
improper
for
*NL*
her
;
and
,
in
the
course
of
a
few
minutes
,
she
found
herself
with
Henry
*NL*
in
the
curricle
,
as
happy
a
being
as
ever
existed
.
A
very
short
trial
*NL*
convinced
her
that
a
curricle
was
the
prettiest
equipage
in
the
world
;
*NL*
the
chaise
and
four
wheeled
off
with
some
grandeur
,
to
be
sure
,
but
it
*NL*
was
a
heavy
and
troublesome
business
,
and
she
could
not
easily
forget
*NL*
its
having
stopped
two
hours
at
Petty
France
.
Half
the
time
would
*NL*
have
been
enough
for
the
curricle
,
and
so
nimbly
were
the
light
horses
*NL*
disposed
to
move
,
that
,
had
not
the
general
chosen
to
have
his
own
*NL*
carriage
lead
the
way
,
they
could
have
passed
it
with
ease
in
half
a
*NL*
minute
.
But
the
merit
of
the
curricle
did
not
all
belong
to
the
horses
;
*NL*
Henry
drove
so
well
--
so
quietly
--
without
making
any
disturbance
,
*NL*
without
parading
to
her
,
or
swearing
at
them
:
so
different
from
the
only
*NL*
gentleman-coachman
whom
it
was
in
her
power
to
compare
him
with
!
And
*NL*
then
his
hat
sat
so
well
,
and
the
innumerable
capes
of
his
greatcoat
*NL*
looked
so
becomingly
important
!
To
be
driven
by
him
,
next
to
being
*NL*
dancing
with
him
,
was
certainly
the
greatest
happiness
in
the
world
.
In
*NL*
addition
to
every
other
delight
,
she
had
now
that
of
listening
to
her
*NL*
own
praise
;
of
being
thanked
at
least
,
on
his
sister
's
account
,
for
*NL*
her
kindness
in
thus
becoming
her
visitor
;
of
hearing
it
ranked
as
real
*NL*
friendship
,
and
described
as
creating
real
gratitude
.
His
sister
,
he
*NL*
said
,
was
uncomfortably
circumstanced
--
she
had
no
female
companion
--
and
,
*NL*
in
the
frequent
absence
of
her
father
,
was
sometimes
without
any
*NL*
companion
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
how
can
that
be
?
''
said
Catherine
.
``
Are
not
you
with
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Northanger
is
not
more
than
half
my
home
;
I
have
an
establishment
at
*NL*
my
own
house
in
Woodston
,
which
is
nearly
twenty
miles
from
my
father
's
,
*NL*
and
some
of
my
time
is
necessarily
spent
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
sorry
you
must
be
for
that
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
always
sorry
to
leave
Eleanor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
but
besides
your
affection
for
her
,
you
must
be
so
fond
of
*NL*
the
abbey
!
After
being
used
to
such
a
home
as
the
abbey
,
an
ordinary
*NL*
parsonage-house
must
be
very
disagreeable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
smiled
,
and
said
,
``
You
have
formed
a
very
favourable
idea
of
the
*NL*
abbey
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
be
sure
,
I
have
.
Is
not
it
a
fine
old
place
,
just
like
what
one
*NL*
reads
about
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
are
you
prepared
to
encounter
all
the
horrors
that
a
building
such
*NL*
as
`
what
one
reads
about
'
may
produce
?
Have
you
a
stout
heart
?
Nerves
*NL*
fit
for
sliding
panels
and
tapestry
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
yes
--
I
do
not
think
I
should
be
easily
frightened
,
because
there
*NL*
would
be
so
many
people
in
the
house
--
and
besides
,
it
has
never
been
*NL*
uninhabited
and
left
deserted
for
years
,
and
then
the
family
come
back
*NL*
to
it
unawares
,
without
giving
any
notice
,
as
generally
happens
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
certainly
.
We
shall
not
have
to
explore
our
way
into
a
hall
dimly
*NL*
lighted
by
the
expiring
embers
of
a
wood
fire
--
nor
be
obliged
to
spread
*NL*
our
beds
on
the
floor
of
a
room
without
windows
,
doors
,
or
furniture
.
*NL*
But
you
must
be
aware
that
when
a
young
lady
is
-LRB-
by
whatever
means
-RRB-
*NL*
introduced
into
a
dwelling
of
this
kind
,
she
is
always
lodged
apart
from
*NL*
the
rest
of
the
family
.
While
they
snugly
repair
to
their
own
end
of
the
*NL*
house
,
she
is
formally
conducted
by
Dorothy
,
the
ancient
housekeeper
,
up
*NL*
a
different
staircase
,
and
along
many
gloomy
passages
,
into
an
apartment
*NL*
never
used
since
some
cousin
or
kin
died
in
it
about
twenty
years
*NL*
before
.
Can
you
stand
such
a
ceremony
as
this
?
Will
not
your
mind
*NL*
misgive
you
when
you
find
yourself
in
this
gloomy
chamber
--
too
lofty
and
*NL*
extensive
for
you
,
with
only
the
feeble
rays
of
a
single
lamp
to
take
*NL*
in
its
size
--
its
walls
hung
with
tapestry
exhibiting
figures
as
large
as
*NL*
life
,
and
the
bed
,
of
dark
green
stuff
or
purple
velvet
,
presenting
even
*NL*
a
funereal
appearance
?
Will
not
your
heart
sink
within
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
But
this
will
not
happen
to
me
,
I
am
sure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
fearfully
will
you
examine
the
furniture
of
your
apartment
!
And
*NL*
what
will
you
discern
?
Not
tables
,
toilettes
,
wardrobes
,
or
drawers
,
*NL*
but
on
one
side
perhaps
the
remains
of
a
broken
lute
,
on
the
other
a
*NL*
ponderous
chest
which
no
efforts
can
open
,
and
over
the
fireplace
*NL*
the
portrait
of
some
handsome
warrior
,
whose
features
will
so
*NL*
incomprehensibly
strike
you
,
that
you
will
not
be
able
to
withdraw
your
*NL*
eyes
from
it
.
Dorothy
,
meanwhile
,
no
less
struck
by
your
appearance
,
*NL*
gazes
on
you
in
great
agitation
,
and
drops
a
few
unintelligible
hints
.
*NL*
To
raise
your
spirits
,
moreover
,
she
gives
you
reason
to
suppose
that
*NL*
the
part
of
the
abbey
you
inhabit
is
undoubtedly
haunted
,
and
informs
*NL*
you
that
you
will
not
have
a
single
domestic
within
call
.
With
this
*NL*
parting
cordial
she
curtsies
off
--
you
listen
to
the
sound
of
her
*NL*
receding
footsteps
as
long
as
the
last
echo
can
reach
you
--
and
when
,
*NL*
with
fainting
spirits
,
you
attempt
to
fasten
your
door
,
you
discover
,
*NL*
with
increased
alarm
,
that
it
has
no
lock
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
Mr.
Tilney
,
how
frightful
!
This
is
just
like
a
book
!
But
it
can
not
*NL*
really
happen
to
me
.
I
am
sure
your
housekeeper
is
not
really
Dorothy
.
*NL*
Well
,
what
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
further
to
alarm
perhaps
may
occur
the
first
night
.
After
*NL*
surmounting
your
unconquerable
horror
of
the
bed
,
you
will
retire
to
*NL*
rest
,
and
get
a
few
hours
'
unquiet
slumber
.
But
on
the
second
,
or
at
*NL*
farthest
the
third
night
after
your
arrival
,
you
will
probably
have
a
*NL*
violent
storm
.
Peals
of
thunder
so
loud
as
to
seem
to
shake
the
edifice
*NL*
to
its
foundation
will
roll
round
the
neighbouring
mountains
--
and
during
*NL*
the
frightful
gusts
of
wind
which
accompany
it
,
you
will
probably
think
*NL*
you
discern
-LRB-
for
your
lamp
is
not
extinguished
-RRB-
one
part
of
the
hanging
*NL*
more
violently
agitated
than
the
rest
.
Unable
of
course
to
repress
your
*NL*
curiosity
in
so
favourable
a
moment
for
indulging
it
,
you
will
instantly
*NL*
arise
,
and
throwing
your
dressing-gown
around
you
,
proceed
to
examine
*NL*
this
mystery
.
After
a
very
short
search
,
you
will
discover
a
division
in
*NL*
the
tapestry
so
artfully
constructed
as
to
defy
the
minutest
inspection
,
*NL*
and
on
opening
it
,
a
door
will
immediately
appear
--
which
door
,
being
*NL*
only
secured
by
massy
bars
and
a
padlock
,
you
will
,
after
a
few
efforts
,
*NL*
succeed
in
opening
--
and
,
with
your
lamp
in
your
hand
,
will
pass
through
*NL*
it
into
a
small
vaulted
room
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
indeed
;
I
should
be
too
much
frightened
to
do
any
such
thing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
Not
when
Dorothy
has
given
you
to
understand
that
there
is
a
*NL*
secret
subterraneous
communication
between
your
apartment
and
the
chapel
*NL*
of
St.
Anthony
,
scarcely
two
miles
off
?
Could
you
shrink
from
so
simple
*NL*
an
adventure
?
No
,
no
,
you
will
proceed
into
this
small
vaulted
room
,
*NL*
and
through
this
into
several
others
,
without
perceiving
anything
very
*NL*
remarkable
in
either
.
In
one
perhaps
there
may
be
a
dagger
,
in
another
*NL*
a
few
drops
of
blood
,
and
in
a
third
the
remains
of
some
instrument
of
*NL*
torture
;
but
there
being
nothing
in
all
this
out
of
the
common
way
,
*NL*
and
your
lamp
being
nearly
exhausted
,
you
will
return
towards
your
own
*NL*
apartment
.
In
repassing
through
the
small
vaulted
room
,
however
,
your
*NL*
eyes
will
be
attracted
towards
a
large
,
old-fashioned
cabinet
of
ebony
*NL*
and
gold
,
which
,
though
narrowly
examining
the
furniture
before
,
you
*NL*
had
passed
unnoticed
.
Impelled
by
an
irresistible
presentiment
,
you
will
*NL*
eagerly
advance
to
it
,
unlock
its
folding
doors
,
and
search
into
*NL*
every
drawer
--
but
for
some
time
without
discovering
anything
of
*NL*
importance
--
perhaps
nothing
but
a
considerable
hoard
of
diamonds
.
At
*NL*
last
,
however
,
by
touching
a
secret
spring
,
an
inner
compartment
will
*NL*
open
--
a
roll
of
paper
appears
--
you
seize
it
--
it
contains
many
sheets
of
*NL*
manuscript
--
you
hasten
with
the
precious
treasure
into
your
own
chamber
,
*NL*
but
scarcely
have
you
been
able
to
decipher
`
Oh
!
Thou
--
whomsoever
thou
*NL*
mayst
be
,
into
whose
hands
these
memoirs
of
the
wretched
Matilda
may
*NL*
fall
'
--
when
your
lamp
suddenly
expires
in
the
socket
,
and
leaves
you
in
*NL*
total
darkness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
No
,
no
--
do
not
say
so

Well
,
go
on

*NL*
*NL*
But
Henry
was
too
much
amused
by
the
interest
he
had
raised
to
be
able
*NL*
to
carry
it
farther
;
he
could
no
longer
command
solemnity
either
of
*NL*
subject
or
voice
,
and
was
obliged
to
entreat
her
to
use
her
own
fancy
*NL*
in
the
perusal
of
Matilda
's
woes
.
Catherine
,
recollecting
herself
,
grew
*NL*
ashamed
of
her
eagerness
,
and
began
earnestly
to
assure
him
that
her
*NL*
attention
had
been
fixed
without
the
smallest
apprehension
of
really
*NL*
meeting
with
what
he
related

Miss
Tilney
,
she
was
sure
,
would
never
*NL*
put
her
into
such
a
chamber
as
he
had
described
!
She
was
not
at
all
*NL*
afraid
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
drew
near
the
end
of
their
journey
,
her
impatience
for
a
sight
*NL*
of
the
abbey
--
for
some
time
suspended
by
his
conversation
on
subjects
*NL*
very
different
--
returned
in
full
force
,
and
every
bend
in
the
road
was
*NL*
expected
with
solemn
awe
to
afford
a
glimpse
of
its
massy
walls
of
grey
*NL*
stone
,
rising
amidst
a
grove
of
ancient
oaks
,
with
the
last
beams
of
the
*NL*
sun
playing
in
beautiful
splendour
on
its
high
Gothic
windows
.
But
so
*NL*
low
did
the
building
stand
,
that
she
found
herself
passing
through
the
*NL*
great
gates
of
the
lodge
into
the
very
grounds
of
Northanger
,
without
*NL*
having
discerned
even
an
antique
chimney
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
knew
not
that
she
had
any
right
to
be
surprised
,
but
there
was
a
*NL*
something
in
this
mode
of
approach
which
she
certainly
had
not
expected
.
*NL*
To
pass
between
lodges
of
a
modern
appearance
,
to
find
herself
with
such
*NL*
ease
in
the
very
precincts
of
the
abbey
,
and
driven
so
rapidly
along
a
*NL*
smooth
,
level
road
of
fine
gravel
,
without
obstacle
,
alarm
,
or
solemnity
*NL*
of
any
kind
,
struck
her
as
odd
and
inconsistent
.
She
was
not
long
*NL*
at
leisure
,
however
,
for
such
considerations
.
A
sudden
scud
of
rain
,
*NL*
driving
full
in
her
face
,
made
it
impossible
for
her
to
observe
anything
*NL*
further
,
and
fixed
all
her
thoughts
on
the
welfare
of
her
new
straw
*NL*
bonnet
;
and
she
was
actually
under
the
abbey
walls
,
was
springing
,
with
*NL*
Henry
's
assistance
,
from
the
carriage
,
was
beneath
the
shelter
of
the
*NL*
old
porch
,
and
had
even
passed
on
to
the
hall
,
where
her
friend
and
*NL*
the
general
were
waiting
to
welcome
her
,
without
feeling
one
awful
*NL*
foreboding
of
future
misery
to
herself
,
or
one
moment
's
suspicion
of
any
*NL*
past
scenes
of
horror
being
acted
within
the
solemn
edifice
.
The
breeze
*NL*
had
not
seemed
to
waft
the
sighs
of
the
murdered
to
her
;
it
had
wafted
*NL*
nothing
worse
than
a
thick
mizzling
rain
;
and
having
given
a
good
shake
*NL*
to
her
habit
,
she
was
ready
to
be
shown
into
the
common
drawing-room
,
*NL*
and
capable
of
considering
where
she
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
abbey
!
Yes
,
it
was
delightful
to
be
really
in
an
abbey
!
But
she
*NL*
doubted
,
as
she
looked
round
the
room
,
whether
anything
within
her
*NL*
observation
would
have
given
her
the
consciousness
.
The
furniture
was
in
*NL*
all
the
profusion
and
elegance
of
modern
taste
.
The
fireplace
,
where
she
*NL*
had
expected
the
ample
width
and
ponderous
carving
of
former
times
,
was
*NL*
contracted
to
a
Rumford
,
with
slabs
of
plain
though
handsome
marble
,
and
*NL*
ornaments
over
it
of
the
prettiest
English
china
.
The
windows
,
to
which
*NL*
she
looked
with
peculiar
dependence
,
from
having
heard
the
general
talk
*NL*
of
his
preserving
them
in
their
Gothic
form
with
reverential
care
,
were
*NL*
yet
less
what
her
fancy
had
portrayed
.
To
be
sure
,
the
pointed
arch
*NL*
was
preserved
--
the
form
of
them
was
Gothic
--
they
might
be
even
*NL*
casements
--
but
every
pane
was
so
large
,
so
clear
,
so
light
!
To
an
*NL*
imagination
which
had
hoped
for
the
smallest
divisions
,
and
the
heaviest
*NL*
stone-work
,
for
painted
glass
,
dirt
,
and
cobwebs
,
the
difference
was
*NL*
very
distressing
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
general
,
perceiving
how
her
eye
was
employed
,
began
to
talk
of
the
*NL*
smallness
of
the
room
and
simplicity
of
the
furniture
,
where
everything
,
*NL*
being
for
daily
use
,
pretended
only
to
comfort
,
etc.
;
flattering
*NL*
himself
,
however
,
that
there
were
some
apartments
in
the
Abbey
not
*NL*
unworthy
her
notice
--
and
was
proceeding
to
mention
the
costly
gilding
*NL*
of
one
in
particular
,
when
,
taking
out
his
watch
,
he
stopped
short
to
*NL*
pronounce
it
with
surprise
within
twenty
minutes
of
five
!
This
seemed
*NL*
the
word
of
separation
,
and
Catherine
found
herself
hurried
away
by
Miss
*NL*
Tilney
in
such
a
manner
as
convinced
her
that
the
strictest
punctuality
*NL*
to
the
family
hours
would
be
expected
at
Northanger
.
*NL*
*NL*
Returning
through
the
large
and
lofty
hall
,
they
ascended
a
broad
*NL*
staircase
of
shining
oak
,
which
,
after
many
flights
and
many
*NL*
landing-places
,
brought
them
upon
a
long
,
wide
gallery
.
On
one
side
it
*NL*
had
a
range
of
doors
,
and
it
was
lighted
on
the
other
by
windows
which
*NL*
Catherine
had
only
time
to
discover
looked
into
a
quadrangle
,
before
*NL*
Miss
Tilney
led
the
way
into
a
chamber
,
and
scarcely
staying
to
hope
she
*NL*
would
find
it
comfortable
,
left
her
with
an
anxious
entreaty
that
she
*NL*
would
make
as
little
alteration
as
possible
in
her
dress
.

CHAPTER
21
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
A
moment
's
glance
was
enough
to
satisfy
Catherine
that
her
apartment
*NL*
was
very
unlike
the
one
which
Henry
had
endeavoured
to
alarm
her
by
the
*NL*
description
of
.
It
was
by
no
means
unreasonably
large
,
and
contained
*NL*
neither
tapestry
nor
velvet
.
The
walls
were
papered
,
the
floor
was
*NL*
carpeted
;
the
windows
were
neither
less
perfect
nor
more
dim
than
those
*NL*
of
the
drawing-room
below
;
the
furniture
,
though
not
of
the
latest
*NL*
fashion
,
was
handsome
and
comfortable
,
and
the
air
of
the
room
*NL*
altogether
far
from
uncheerful
.
Her
heart
instantaneously
at
ease
on
*NL*
this
point
,
she
resolved
to
lose
no
time
in
particular
examination
of
*NL*
anything
,
as
she
greatly
dreaded
disobliging
the
general
by
any
delay
.
*NL*
Her
habit
therefore
was
thrown
off
with
all
possible
haste
,
and
she
was
*NL*
preparing
to
unpin
the
linen
package
,
which
the
chaise-seat
had
conveyed
*NL*
for
her
immediate
accommodation
,
when
her
eye
suddenly
fell
on
a
large
*NL*
high
chest
,
standing
back
in
a
deep
recess
on
one
side
of
the
fireplace
.
*NL*
The
sight
of
it
made
her
start
;
and
,
forgetting
everything
else
,
she
*NL*
stood
gazing
on
it
in
motionless
wonder
,
while
these
thoughts
crossed
*NL*
her
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
strange
indeed
!
I
did
not
expect
such
a
sight
as
this
!
An
*NL*
immense
heavy
chest
!
What
can
it
hold
?
Why
should
it
be
placed
here
?
*NL*
Pushed
back
too
,
as
if
meant
to
be
out
of
sight
!
I
will
look
into
*NL*
it
--
cost
me
what
it
may
,
I
will
look
into
it
--
and
directly
too
--
by
*NL*
daylight
.
If
I
stay
till
evening
my
candle
may
go
out
.
''
She
advanced
and
*NL*
examined
it
closely
:
it
was
of
cedar
,
curiously
inlaid
with
some
darker
*NL*
wood
,
and
raised
,
about
a
foot
from
the
ground
,
on
a
carved
stand
of
the
*NL*
same
.
The
lock
was
silver
,
though
tarnished
from
age
;
at
each
end
*NL*
were
the
imperfect
remains
of
handles
also
of
silver
,
broken
perhaps
*NL*
prematurely
by
some
strange
violence
;
and
,
on
the
centre
of
the
lid
,
was
*NL*
a
mysterious
cipher
,
in
the
same
metal
.
Catherine
bent
over
it
intently
,
*NL*
but
without
being
able
to
distinguish
anything
with
certainty
.
She
could
*NL*
not
,
in
whatever
direction
she
took
it
,
believe
the
last
letter
to
be
*NL*
a
T
;
and
yet
that
it
should
be
anything
else
in
that
house
was
*NL*
a
circumstance
to
raise
no
common
degree
of
astonishment
.
If
not
*NL*
originally
theirs
,
by
what
strange
events
could
it
have
fallen
into
the
*NL*
Tilney
family
?
*NL*
*NL*
Her
fearful
curiosity
was
every
moment
growing
greater
;
and
seizing
,
*NL*
with
trembling
hands
,
the
hasp
of
the
lock
,
she
resolved
at
all
hazards
*NL*
to
satisfy
herself
at
least
as
to
its
contents
.
With
difficulty
,
for
*NL*
something
seemed
to
resist
her
efforts
,
she
raised
the
lid
a
few
inches
;
*NL*
but
at
that
moment
a
sudden
knocking
at
the
door
of
the
room
made
her
,
*NL*
starting
,
quit
her
hold
,
and
the
lid
closed
with
alarming
violence
.
This
*NL*
ill-timed
intruder
was
Miss
Tilney
's
maid
,
sent
by
her
mistress
to
be
of
*NL*
use
to
Miss
Morland
;
and
though
Catherine
immediately
dismissed
her
,
it
*NL*
recalled
her
to
the
sense
of
what
she
ought
to
be
doing
,
and
forced
her
,
*NL*
in
spite
of
her
anxious
desire
to
penetrate
this
mystery
,
to
proceed
in
*NL*
her
dressing
without
further
delay
.
Her
progress
was
not
quick
,
for
her
*NL*
thoughts
and
her
eyes
were
still
bent
on
the
object
so
well
calculated
*NL*
to
interest
and
alarm
;
and
though
she
dared
not
waste
a
moment
upon
*NL*
a
second
attempt
,
she
could
not
remain
many
paces
from
the
chest
.
At
*NL*
length
,
however
,
having
slipped
one
arm
into
her
gown
,
her
toilette
*NL*
seemed
so
nearly
finished
that
the
impatience
of
her
curiosity
might
*NL*
safely
be
indulged
.
One
moment
surely
might
be
spared
;
and
,
so
desperate
*NL*
should
be
the
exertion
of
her
strength
,
that
,
unless
secured
by
*NL*
supernatural
means
,
the
lid
in
one
moment
should
be
thrown
back
.
With
*NL*
this
spirit
she
sprang
forward
,
and
her
confidence
did
not
deceive
her
.
*NL*
Her
resolute
effort
threw
back
the
lid
,
and
gave
to
her
astonished
eyes
*NL*
the
view
of
a
white
cotton
counterpane
,
properly
folded
,
reposing
at
one
*NL*
end
of
the
chest
in
undisputed
possession
!
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
gazing
on
it
with
the
first
blush
of
surprise
when
Miss
Tilney
,
*NL*
anxious
for
her
friend
's
being
ready
,
entered
the
room
,
and
to
the
*NL*
rising
shame
of
having
harboured
for
some
minutes
an
absurd
expectation
,
*NL*
was
then
added
the
shame
of
being
caught
in
so
idle
a
search
.
``
That
is
*NL*
a
curious
old
chest
,
is
not
it
?
''
said
Miss
Tilney
,
as
Catherine
hastily
*NL*
closed
it
and
turned
away
to
the
glass
.
``
It
is
impossible
to
say
how
*NL*
many
generations
it
has
been
here
.
How
it
came
to
be
first
put
in
this
*NL*
room
I
know
not
,
but
I
have
not
had
it
moved
,
because
I
thought
it
might
*NL*
sometimes
be
of
use
in
holding
hats
and
bonnets
.
The
worst
of
it
is
that
*NL*
its
weight
makes
it
difficult
to
open
.
In
that
corner
,
however
,
it
is
at
*NL*
least
out
of
the
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Catherine
had
no
leisure
for
speech
,
being
at
once
blushing
,
tying
her
*NL*
gown
,
and
forming
wise
resolutions
with
the
most
violent
dispatch
.
Miss
*NL*
Tilney
gently
hinted
her
fear
of
being
late
;
and
in
half
a
minute
they
*NL*
ran
downstairs
together
,
in
an
alarm
not
wholly
unfounded
,
for
General
*NL*
Tilney
was
pacing
the
drawing-room
,
his
watch
in
his
hand
,
and
having
,
*NL*
on
the
very
instant
of
their
entering
,
pulled
the
bell
with
violence
,
*NL*
ordered
``
Dinner
to
be
on
table
directly
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Catherine
trembled
at
the
emphasis
with
which
he
spoke
,
and
sat
pale
*NL*
and
breathless
,
in
a
most
humble
mood
,
concerned
for
his
children
,
and
*NL*
detesting
old
chests
;
and
the
general
,
recovering
his
politeness
as
he
*NL*
looked
at
her
,
spent
the
rest
of
his
time
in
scolding
his
daughter
for
*NL*
so
foolishly
hurrying
her
fair
friend
,
who
was
absolutely
out
of
breath
*NL*
from
haste
,
when
there
was
not
the
least
occasion
for
hurry
in
the
*NL*
world
:
but
Catherine
could
not
at
all
get
over
the
double
distress
*NL*
of
having
involved
her
friend
in
a
lecture
and
been
a
great
simpleton
*NL*
herself
,
till
they
were
happily
seated
at
the
dinner-table
,
when
the
*NL*
general
's
complacent
smiles
,
and
a
good
appetite
of
her
own
,
restored
*NL*
her
to
peace
.
The
dining-parlour
was
a
noble
room
,
suitable
in
its
*NL*
dimensions
to
a
much
larger
drawing-room
than
the
one
in
common
use
,
and
*NL*
fitted
up
in
a
style
of
luxury
and
expense
which
was
almost
lost
on
the
*NL*
unpractised
eye
of
Catherine
,
who
saw
little
more
than
its
spaciousness
*NL*
and
the
number
of
their
attendants
.
Of
the
former
,
she
spoke
aloud
*NL*
her
admiration
;
and
the
general
,
with
a
very
gracious
countenance
,
*NL*
acknowledged
that
it
was
by
no
means
an
ill-sized
room
,
and
further
*NL*
confessed
that
,
though
as
careless
on
such
subjects
as
most
people
,
he
*NL*
did
look
upon
a
tolerably
large
eating-room
as
one
of
the
necessaries
*NL*
of
life
;
he
supposed
,
however
,
``
that
she
must
have
been
used
to
much
*NL*
better-sized
apartments
at
Mr.
Allen
's
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
indeed
,
''
was
Catherine
's
honest
assurance
;
``
Mr.
Allen
's
*NL*
dining-parlour
was
not
more
than
half
as
large
,
''
and
she
had
never
*NL*
seen
so
large
a
room
as
this
in
her
life
.
The
general
's
good
humour
*NL*
increased
.
Why
,
as
he
had
such
rooms
,
he
thought
it
would
be
simple
not
*NL*
to
make
use
of
them
;
but
,
upon
his
honour
,
he
believed
there
might
be
*NL*
more
comfort
in
rooms
of
only
half
their
size
.
Mr.
Allen
's
house
,
he
was
*NL*
sure
,
must
be
exactly
of
the
true
size
for
rational
happiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
evening
passed
without
any
further
disturbance
,
and
,
in
the
*NL*
occasional
absence
of
General
Tilney
,
with
much
positive
cheerfulness
.
*NL*
It
was
only
in
his
presence
that
Catherine
felt
the
smallest
fatigue
*NL*
from
her
journey
;
and
even
then
,
even
in
moments
of
languor
or
*NL*
restraint
,
a
sense
of
general
happiness
preponderated
,
and
she
could
*NL*
think
of
her
friends
in
Bath
without
one
wish
of
being
with
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
night
was
stormy
;
the
wind
had
been
rising
at
intervals
the
whole
*NL*
afternoon
;
and
by
the
time
the
party
broke
up
,
it
blew
and
rained
*NL*
violently
.
Catherine
,
as
she
crossed
the
hall
,
listened
to
the
tempest
*NL*
with
sensations
of
awe
;
and
,
when
she
heard
it
rage
round
a
corner
of
*NL*
the
ancient
building
and
close
with
sudden
fury
a
distant
door
,
felt
*NL*
for
the
first
time
that
she
was
really
in
an
abbey
.
Yes
,
these
were
*NL*
characteristic
sounds
;
they
brought
to
her
recollection
a
countless
*NL*
variety
of
dreadful
situations
and
horrid
scenes
,
which
such
buildings
*NL*
had
witnessed
,
and
such
storms
ushered
in
;
and
most
heartily
did
she
*NL*
rejoice
in
the
happier
circumstances
attending
her
entrance
within
walls
*NL*
so
solemn
!
She
had
nothing
to
dread
from
midnight
assassins
or
drunken
*NL*
gallants
.
Henry
had
certainly
been
only
in
jest
in
what
he
had
told
her
*NL*
that
morning
.
In
a
house
so
furnished
,
and
so
guarded
,
she
could
have
*NL*
nothing
to
explore
or
to
suffer
,
and
might
go
to
her
bedroom
as
securely
*NL*
as
if
it
had
been
her
own
chamber
at
Fullerton
.
Thus
wisely
fortifying
*NL*
her
mind
,
as
she
proceeded
upstairs
,
she
was
enabled
,
especially
on
*NL*
perceiving
that
Miss
Tilney
slept
only
two
doors
from
her
,
to
enter
*NL*
her
room
with
a
tolerably
stout
heart
;
and
her
spirits
were
immediately
*NL*
assisted
by
the
cheerful
blaze
of
a
wood
fire
.
``
How
much
better
is
*NL*
this
,
''
said
she
,
as
she
walked
to
the
fender
--
``
how
much
better
to
find
a
*NL*
fire
ready
lit
,
than
to
have
to
wait
shivering
in
the
cold
till
all
the
*NL*
family
are
in
bed
,
as
so
many
poor
girls
have
been
obliged
to
do
,
and
*NL*
then
to
have
a
faithful
old
servant
frightening
one
by
coming
in
with
a
*NL*
faggot
!
How
glad
I
am
that
Northanger
is
what
it
is
!
If
it
had
been
like
*NL*
some
other
places
,
I
do
not
know
that
,
in
such
a
night
as
this
,
I
could
*NL*
have
answered
for
my
courage
:
but
now
,
to
be
sure
,
there
is
nothing
to
*NL*
alarm
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
round
the
room
.
The
window
curtains
seemed
in
motion
.
It
*NL*
could
be
nothing
but
the
violence
of
the
wind
penetrating
through
the
*NL*
divisions
of
the
shutters
;
and
she
stepped
boldly
forward
,
carelessly
*NL*
humming
a
tune
,
to
assure
herself
of
its
being
so
,
peeped
courageously
*NL*
behind
each
curtain
,
saw
nothing
on
either
low
window
seat
to
scare
her
,
*NL*
and
on
placing
a
hand
against
the
shutter
,
felt
the
strongest
conviction
*NL*
of
the
wind
's
force
.
A
glance
at
the
old
chest
,
as
she
turned
away
from
*NL*
this
examination
,
was
not
without
its
use
;
she
scorned
the
causeless
*NL*
fears
of
an
idle
fancy
,
and
began
with
a
most
happy
indifference
to
*NL*
prepare
herself
for
bed
.
``
She
should
take
her
time
;
she
should
not
hurry
*NL*
herself
;
she
did
not
care
if
she
were
the
last
person
up
in
the
house
.
*NL*
But
she
would
not
make
up
her
fire
;
that
would
seem
cowardly
,
as
if
*NL*
she
wished
for
the
protection
of
light
after
she
were
in
bed
.
''
The
fire
*NL*
therefore
died
away
,
and
Catherine
,
having
spent
the
best
part
of
an
*NL*
hour
in
her
arrangements
,
was
beginning
to
think
of
stepping
into
bed
,
*NL*
when
,
on
giving
a
parting
glance
round
the
room
,
she
was
struck
by
the
*NL*
appearance
of
a
high
,
old-fashioned
black
cabinet
,
which
,
though
in
*NL*
a
situation
conspicuous
enough
,
had
never
caught
her
notice
before
.
*NL*
Henry
's
words
,
his
description
of
the
ebony
cabinet
which
was
to
escape
*NL*
her
observation
at
first
,
immediately
rushed
across
her
;
and
though
*NL*
there
could
be
nothing
really
in
it
,
there
was
something
whimsical
,
it
*NL*
was
certainly
a
very
remarkable
coincidence
!
She
took
her
candle
and
*NL*
looked
closely
at
the
cabinet
.
It
was
not
absolutely
ebony
and
gold
;
but
*NL*
it
was
japan
,
black
and
yellow
japan
of
the
handsomest
kind
;
and
as
she
*NL*
held
her
candle
,
the
yellow
had
very
much
the
effect
of
gold
.
The
key
*NL*
was
in
the
door
,
and
she
had
a
strange
fancy
to
look
into
it
;
not
,
*NL*
however
,
with
the
smallest
expectation
of
finding
anything
,
but
it
was
*NL*
so
very
odd
,
after
what
Henry
had
said
.
In
short
,
she
could
not
sleep
*NL*
till
she
had
examined
it
.
So
,
placing
the
candle
with
great
caution
on
*NL*
a
chair
,
she
seized
the
key
with
a
very
tremulous
hand
and
tried
to
turn
*NL*
it
;
but
it
resisted
her
utmost
strength
.
Alarmed
,
but
not
discouraged
,
*NL*
she
tried
it
another
way
;
a
bolt
flew
,
and
she
believed
herself
*NL*
successful
;
but
how
strangely
mysterious
!
The
door
was
still
immovable
.
*NL*
She
paused
a
moment
in
breathless
wonder
.
The
wind
roared
down
the
*NL*
chimney
,
the
rain
beat
in
torrents
against
the
windows
,
and
everything
*NL*
seemed
to
speak
the
awfulness
of
her
situation
.
To
retire
to
bed
,
*NL*
however
,
unsatisfied
on
such
a
point
,
would
be
vain
,
since
sleep
must
be
*NL*
impossible
with
the
consciousness
of
a
cabinet
so
mysteriously
closed
*NL*
in
her
immediate
vicinity
.
Again
,
therefore
,
she
applied
herself
to
the
*NL*
key
,
and
after
moving
it
in
every
possible
way
for
some
instants
with
*NL*
the
determined
celerity
of
hope
's
last
effort
,
the
door
suddenly
yielded
*NL*
to
her
hand
:
her
heart
leaped
with
exultation
at
such
a
victory
,
and
*NL*
having
thrown
open
each
folding
door
,
the
second
being
secured
only
by
*NL*
bolts
of
less
wonderful
construction
than
the
lock
,
though
in
that
her
*NL*
eye
could
not
discern
anything
unusual
,
a
double
range
of
small
drawers
*NL*
appeared
in
view
,
with
some
larger
drawers
above
and
below
them
;
and
in
*NL*
the
centre
,
a
small
door
,
closed
also
with
a
lock
and
key
,
secured
in
*NL*
all
probability
a
cavity
of
importance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Catherine
's
heart
beat
quick
,
but
her
courage
did
not
fail
her
.
With
a
*NL*
cheek
flushed
by
hope
,
and
an
eye
straining
with
curiosity
,
her
fingers
*NL*
grasped
the
handle
of
a
drawer
and
drew
it
forth
.
It
was
entirely
empty
.
*NL*
With
less
alarm
and
greater
eagerness
she
seized
a
second
,
a
third
,
a
*NL*
fourth
;
each
was
equally
empty
.
Not
one
was
left
unsearched
,
and
in
not
*NL*
one
was
anything
found
.
Well
read
in
the
art
of
concealing
a
treasure
,
*NL*
the
possibility
of
false
linings
to
the
drawers
did
not
escape
her
,
and
*NL*
she
felt
round
each
with
anxious
acuteness
in
vain
.
The
place
in
the
*NL*
middle
alone
remained
now
unexplored
;
and
though
she
had
``
never
from
*NL*
the
first
had
the
smallest
idea
of
finding
anything
in
any
part
of
the
*NL*
cabinet
,
and
was
not
in
the
least
disappointed
at
her
ill
success
thus
*NL*
far
,
it
would
be
foolish
not
to
examine
it
thoroughly
while
she
was
*NL*
about
it
.
''
It
was
some
time
however
before
she
could
unfasten
the
door
,
*NL*
the
same
difficulty
occurring
in
the
management
of
this
inner
lock
as
of
*NL*
the
outer
;
but
at
length
it
did
open
;
and
not
vain
,
as
hitherto
,
was
her
*NL*
search
;
her
quick
eyes
directly
fell
on
a
roll
of
paper
pushed
back
*NL*
into
the
further
part
of
the
cavity
,
apparently
for
concealment
,
and
*NL*
her
feelings
at
that
moment
were
indescribable
.
Her
heart
fluttered
,
her
*NL*
knees
trembled
,
and
her
cheeks
grew
pale
.
She
seized
,
with
an
unsteady
*NL*
hand
,
the
precious
manuscript
,
for
half
a
glance
sufficed
to
ascertain
*NL*
written
characters
;
and
while
she
acknowledged
with
awful
sensations
*NL*
this
striking
exemplification
of
what
Henry
had
foretold
,
resolved
*NL*
instantly
to
peruse
every
line
before
she
attempted
to
rest
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
dimness
of
the
light
her
candle
emitted
made
her
turn
to
it
with
*NL*
alarm
;
but
there
was
no
danger
of
its
sudden
extinction
;
it
had
yet
some
*NL*
hours
to
burn
;
and
that
she
might
not
have
any
greater
difficulty
in
*NL*
distinguishing
the
writing
than
what
its
ancient
date
might
occasion
,
*NL*
she
hastily
snuffed
it
.
Alas
!
It
was
snuffed
and
extinguished
in
one
.
A
*NL*
lamp
could
not
have
expired
with
more
awful
effect
.
Catherine
,
for
a
*NL*
few
moments
,
was
motionless
with
horror
.
It
was
done
completely
;
not
a
*NL*
remnant
of
light
in
the
wick
could
give
hope
to
the
rekindling
breath
.
*NL*
Darkness
impenetrable
and
immovable
filled
the
room
.
A
violent
gust
*NL*
of
wind
,
rising
with
sudden
fury
,
added
fresh
horror
to
the
moment
.
*NL*
Catherine
trembled
from
head
to
foot
.
In
the
pause
which
succeeded
,
a
*NL*
sound
like
receding
footsteps
and
the
closing
of
a
distant
door
struck
*NL*
on
her
affrighted
ear
.
Human
nature
could
support
no
more
.
A
cold
sweat
*NL*
stood
on
her
forehead
,
the
manuscript
fell
from
her
hand
,
and
groping
*NL*
her
way
to
the
bed
,
she
jumped
hastily
in
,
and
sought
some
suspension
of
*NL*
agony
by
creeping
far
underneath
the
clothes
.
To
close
her
eyes
in
*NL*
sleep
that
night
,
she
felt
must
be
entirely
out
of
the
question
.
With
*NL*
a
curiosity
so
justly
awakened
,
and
feelings
in
every
way
so
agitated
,
*NL*
repose
must
be
absolutely
impossible
.
The
storm
too
abroad
so
dreadful
!
*NL*
She
had
not
been
used
to
feel
alarm
from
wind
,
but
now
every
blast
*NL*
seemed
fraught
with
awful
intelligence
.
The
manuscript
so
wonderfully
*NL*
found
,
so
wonderfully
accomplishing
the
morning
's
prediction
,
how
was
it
*NL*
to
be
accounted
for
?
What
could
it
contain
?
To
whom
could
it
relate
?
*NL*
By
what
means
could
it
have
been
so
long
concealed
?
And
how
singularly
*NL*
strange
that
it
should
fall
to
her
lot
to
discover
it
!
Till
she
had
made
*NL*
herself
mistress
of
its
contents
,
however
,
she
could
have
neither
repose
*NL*
nor
comfort
;
and
with
the
sun
's
first
rays
she
was
determined
to
peruse
*NL*
it
.
But
many
were
the
tedious
hours
which
must
yet
intervene
.
She
*NL*
shuddered
,
tossed
about
in
her
bed
,
and
envied
every
quiet
sleeper
.
The
*NL*
storm
still
raged
,
and
various
were
the
noises
,
more
terrific
even
*NL*
than
the
wind
,
which
struck
at
intervals
on
her
startled
ear
.
The
very
*NL*
curtains
of
her
bed
seemed
at
one
moment
in
motion
,
and
at
another
*NL*
the
lock
of
her
door
was
agitated
,
as
if
by
the
attempt
of
somebody
to
*NL*
enter
.
Hollow
murmurs
seemed
to
creep
along
the
gallery
,
and
more
than
*NL*
once
her
blood
was
chilled
by
the
sound
of
distant
moans
.
Hour
after
*NL*
hour
passed
away
,
and
the
wearied
Catherine
had
heard
three
proclaimed
*NL*
by
all
the
clocks
in
the
house
before
the
tempest
subsided
or
she
*NL*
unknowingly
fell
fast
asleep
.

CHAPTER
22
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
housemaid
's
folding
back
her
window-shutters
at
eight
o'clock
the
*NL*
next
day
was
the
sound
which
first
roused
Catherine
;
and
she
opened
her
*NL*
eyes
,
wondering
that
they
could
ever
have
been
closed
,
on
objects
of
*NL*
cheerfulness
;
her
fire
was
already
burning
,
and
a
bright
morning
*NL*
had
succeeded
the
tempest
of
the
night
.
Instantaneously
,
with
the
*NL*
consciousness
of
existence
,
returned
her
recollection
of
the
manuscript
;
*NL*
and
springing
from
the
bed
in
the
very
moment
of
the
maid
's
going
away
,
*NL*
she
eagerly
collected
every
scattered
sheet
which
had
burst
from
the
*NL*
roll
on
its
falling
to
the
ground
,
and
flew
back
to
enjoy
the
luxury
*NL*
of
their
perusal
on
her
pillow
.
She
now
plainly
saw
that
she
must
not
*NL*
expect
a
manuscript
of
equal
length
with
the
generality
of
what
she
had
*NL*
shuddered
over
in
books
,
for
the
roll
,
seeming
to
consist
entirely
of
*NL*
small
disjointed
sheets
,
was
altogether
but
of
trifling
size
,
and
much
*NL*
less
than
she
had
supposed
it
to
be
at
first
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
greedy
eye
glanced
rapidly
over
a
page
.
She
started
at
its
import
.
*NL*
Could
it
be
possible
,
or
did
not
her
senses
play
her
false
?
An
inventory
*NL*
of
linen
,
in
coarse
and
modern
characters
,
seemed
all
that
was
before
*NL*
her
!
If
the
evidence
of
sight
might
be
trusted
,
she
held
a
washing-bill
*NL*
in
her
hand
.
She
seized
another
sheet
,
and
saw
the
same
articles
with
*NL*
little
variation
;
a
third
,
a
fourth
,
and
a
fifth
presented
nothing
*NL*
new
.
Shirts
,
stockings
,
cravats
,
and
waistcoats
faced
her
in
each
.
Two
*NL*
others
,
penned
by
the
same
hand
,
marked
an
expenditure
scarcely
more
*NL*
interesting
,
in
letters
,
hair-powder
,
shoe-string
,
and
breeches-ball
.
*NL*
And
the
larger
sheet
,
which
had
enclosed
the
rest
,
seemed
by
its
first
*NL*
cramp
line
,
``
To
poultice
chestnut
mare
''
--
a
farrier
's
bill
!
Such
was
the
*NL*
collection
of
papers
-LRB-
left
perhaps
,
as
she
could
then
suppose
,
by
the
*NL*
negligence
of
a
servant
in
the
place
whence
she
had
taken
them
-RRB-
which
*NL*
had
filled
her
with
expectation
and
alarm
,
and
robbed
her
of
half
her
*NL*
night
's
rest
!
She
felt
humbled
to
the
dust
.
Could
not
the
adventure
of
*NL*
the
chest
have
taught
her
wisdom
?
A
corner
of
it
,
catching
her
eye
as
*NL*
she
lay
,
seemed
to
rise
up
in
judgment
against
her
.
Nothing
could
now
*NL*
be
clearer
than
the
absurdity
of
her
recent
fancies
.
To
suppose
that
a
*NL*
manuscript
of
many
generations
back
could
have
remained
undiscovered
in
*NL*
a
room
such
as
that
,
so
modern
,
so
habitable
!
--
Or
that
she
should
be
the
*NL*
first
to
possess
the
skill
of
unlocking
a
cabinet
,
the
key
of
which
was
*NL*
open
to
all
!
*NL*
*NL*
How
could
she
have
so
imposed
on
herself
?
Heaven
forbid
that
Henry
*NL*
Tilney
should
ever
know
her
folly
!
And
it
was
in
a
great
measure
his
*NL*
own
doing
,
for
had
not
the
cabinet
appeared
so
exactly
to
agree
with
his
*NL*
description
of
her
adventures
,
she
should
never
have
felt
the
smallest
*NL*
curiosity
about
it
.
This
was
the
only
comfort
that
occurred
.
Impatient
*NL*
to
get
rid
of
those
hateful
evidences
of
her
folly
,
those
detestable
*NL*
papers
then
scattered
over
the
bed
,
she
rose
directly
,
and
folding
them
*NL*
up
as
nearly
as
possible
in
the
same
shape
as
before
,
returned
them
*NL*
to
the
same
spot
within
the
cabinet
,
with
a
very
hearty
wish
that
no
*NL*
untoward
accident
might
ever
bring
them
forward
again
,
to
disgrace
her
*NL*
even
with
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Why
the
locks
should
have
been
so
difficult
to
open
,
however
,
was
still
*NL*
something
remarkable
,
for
she
could
now
manage
them
with
perfect
ease
.
*NL*
In
this
there
was
surely
something
mysterious
,
and
she
indulged
in
the
*NL*
flattering
suggestion
for
half
a
minute
,
till
the
possibility
of
the
*NL*
door
's
having
been
at
first
unlocked
,
and
of
being
herself
its
fastener
,
*NL*
darted
into
her
head
,
and
cost
her
another
blush
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
got
away
as
soon
as
she
could
from
a
room
in
which
her
conduct
*NL*
produced
such
unpleasant
reflections
,
and
found
her
way
with
all
speed
*NL*
to
the
breakfast-parlour
,
as
it
had
been
pointed
out
to
her
by
Miss
*NL*
Tilney
the
evening
before
.
Henry
was
alone
in
it
;
and
his
immediate
hope
*NL*
of
her
having
been
undisturbed
by
the
tempest
,
with
an
arch
reference
*NL*
to
the
character
of
the
building
they
inhabited
,
was
rather
distressing
.
*NL*
For
the
world
would
she
not
have
her
weakness
suspected
,
and
yet
,
*NL*
unequal
to
an
absolute
falsehood
,
was
constrained
to
acknowledge
that
*NL*
the
wind
had
kept
her
awake
a
little
.
``
But
we
have
a
charming
morning
*NL*
after
it
,
''
she
added
,
desiring
to
get
rid
of
the
subject
;
``
and
storms
*NL*
and
sleeplessness
are
nothing
when
they
are
over
.
What
beautiful
*NL*
hyacinths
!
I
have
just
learnt
to
love
a
hyacinth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
might
you
learn
?
By
accident
or
argument
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
sister
taught
me
;
I
can
not
tell
how
.
Mrs.
Allen
used
to
take
*NL*
pains
,
year
after
year
,
to
make
me
like
them
;
but
I
never
could
,
till
*NL*
I
saw
them
the
other
day
in
Milsom
Street
;
I
am
naturally
indifferent
*NL*
about
flowers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
now
you
love
a
hyacinth

So
much
the
better

You
have
gained
a
new
*NL*
source
of
enjoyment
,
and
it
is
well
to
have
as
many
holds
upon
happiness
*NL*
as
possible
.
Besides
,
a
taste
for
flowers
is
always
desirable
in
your
*NL*
sex
,
as
a
means
of
getting
you
out
of
doors
,
and
tempting
you
to
more
*NL*
frequent
exercise
than
you
would
otherwise
take
.
And
though
the
love
*NL*
of
a
hyacinth
may
be
rather
domestic
,
who
can
tell
,
the
sentiment
once
*NL*
raised
,
but
you
may
in
time
come
to
love
a
rose
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
do
not
want
any
such
pursuit
to
get
me
out
of
doors

The
pleasure
*NL*
of
walking
and
breathing
fresh
air
is
enough
for
me

and
in
fine
weather
*NL*
I
am
out
more
than
half
my
time

Mamma
says
I
am
never

*NL*
*NL*
``
At
any
rate
,
however
,
I
am
pleased
that
you
have
learnt
to
love
*NL*
a

The
mere
habit
of
learning
to
love
is
the
thing
;

a
*NL*
teachableness
of
disposition
in
a
young
lady
is
a
great
blessing

Has
my
*NL*
sister
a
pleasant
mode
of
instruction
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Catherine
was
saved
the
embarrassment
of
attempting
an
answer
by
the
*NL*
entrance
of
the
general
,
whose
smiling
compliments
announced
a
happy
*NL*
state
of
mind
,
but
whose
gentle
hint
of
sympathetic
early
rising
did
not
*NL*
advance
her
composure
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
elegance
of
the
breakfast
set
forced
itself
on
Catherine
's
notice
*NL*
when
they
were
seated
at
table
;
and
,
luckily
,
it
had
been
the
general
's
*NL*
choice
.
He
was
enchanted
by
her
approbation
of
his
taste
,
confessed
it
*NL*
to
be
neat
and
simple
,
thought
it
right
to
encourage
the
manufacture
of
*NL*
his
country
;
and
for
his
part
,
to
his
uncritical
palate
,
the
tea
was
as
*NL*
well
flavoured
from
the
clay
of
Staffordshire
,
as
from
that
of
Dresden
*NL*
or
Save
.
But
this
was
quite
an
old
set
,
purchased
two
years
ago
.
*NL*
The
manufacture
was
much
improved
since
that
time
;
he
had
seen
some
*NL*
beautiful
specimens
when
last
in
town
,
and
had
he
not
been
perfectly
*NL*
without
vanity
of
that
kind
,
might
have
been
tempted
to
order
a
new
*NL*
set
.
He
trusted
,
however
,
that
an
opportunity
might
ere
long
occur
of
*NL*
selecting
one
--
though
not
for
himself
.
Catherine
was
probably
the
only
*NL*
one
of
the
party
who
did
not
understand
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Shortly
after
breakfast
Henry
left
them
for
Woodston
,
where
business
*NL*
required
and
would
keep
him
two
or
three
days
.
They
all
attended
in
*NL*
the
hall
to
see
him
mount
his
horse
,
and
immediately
on
re-entering
the
*NL*
breakfast-room
,
Catherine
walked
to
a
window
in
the
hope
of
catching
*NL*
another
glimpse
of
his
figure
.
``
This
is
a
somewhat
heavy
call
upon
your
*NL*
brother
's
fortitude
,
''
observed
the
general
to
Eleanor
.
``
Woodston
will
*NL*
make
but
a
sombre
appearance
today
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
a
pretty
place
?
''
asked
Catherine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
say
you
,
Eleanor
?
Speak
your
opinion
,
for
ladies
can
best
tell
the
*NL*
taste
of
ladies
in
regard
to
places
as
well
as
men
.
I
think
it
would
be
*NL*
acknowledged
by
the
most
impartial
eye
to
have
many
recommendations
.
The
*NL*
house
stands
among
fine
meadows
facing
the
south-east
,
with
an
excellent
*NL*
kitchen-garden
in
the
same
aspect
;
the
walls
surrounding
which
I
built
*NL*
and
stocked
myself
about
ten
years
ago
,
for
the
benefit
of
my
son
.
It
*NL*
is
a
family
living
,
Miss
Morland
;
and
the
property
in
the
place
being
*NL*
chiefly
my
own
,
you
may
believe
I
take
care
that
it
shall
not
be
a
bad
*NL*
one
.
Did
Henry
's
income
depend
solely
on
this
living
,
he
would
not
be
*NL*
ill-provided
for
.
Perhaps
it
may
seem
odd
,
that
with
only
two
younger
*NL*
children
,
I
should
think
any
profession
necessary
for
him
;
and
certainly
*NL*
there
are
moments
when
we
could
all
wish
him
disengaged
from
every
tie
*NL*
of
business
.
But
though
I
may
not
exactly
make
converts
of
you
young
*NL*
ladies
,
I
am
sure
your
father
,
Miss
Morland
,
would
agree
with
me
in
*NL*
thinking
it
expedient
to
give
every
young
man
some
employment
.
The
*NL*
money
is
nothing
,
it
is
not
an
object
,
but
employment
is
the
thing
.
*NL*
Even
Frederick
,
my
eldest
son
,
you
see
,
who
will
perhaps
inherit
as
*NL*
considerable
a
landed
property
as
any
private
man
in
the
county
,
has
his
*NL*
profession
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
imposing
effect
of
this
last
argument
was
equal
to
his
wishes
.
The
*NL*
silence
of
the
lady
proved
it
to
be
unanswerable
.
*NL*
*NL*
Something
had
been
said
the
evening
before
of
her
being
shown
over
the
*NL*
house
,
and
he
now
offered
himself
as
her
conductor
;
and
though
Catherine
*NL*
had
hoped
to
explore
it
accompanied
only
by
his
daughter
,
it
was
a
*NL*
proposal
of
too
much
happiness
in
itself
,
under
any
circumstances
,
not
*NL*
to
be
gladly
accepted
;
for
she
had
been
already
eighteen
hours
in
the
*NL*
abbey
,
and
had
seen
only
a
few
of
its
rooms
.
The
netting-box
,
just
*NL*
leisurely
drawn
forth
,
was
closed
with
joyful
haste
,
and
she
was
ready
*NL*
to
attend
him
in
a
moment
.
``
And
when
they
had
gone
over
the
house
,
he
*NL*
promised
himself
moreover
the
pleasure
of
accompanying
her
into
the
*NL*
shrubberies
and
garden
.
''
She
curtsied
her
acquiescence
.
``
But
perhaps
*NL*
it
might
be
more
agreeable
to
her
to
make
those
her
first
object
.
*NL*
The
weather
was
at
present
favourable
,
and
at
this
time
of
year
the
*NL*
uncertainty
was
very
great
of
its
continuing
so
.
Which
would
she
prefer
?
*NL*
He
was
equally
at
her
service
.
Which
did
his
daughter
think
would
most
*NL*
accord
with
her
fair
friend
's
wishes
?
But
he
thought
he
could
discern
.
*NL*
Yes
,
he
certainly
read
in
Miss
Morland
's
eyes
a
judicious
desire
of
*NL*
making
use
of
the
present
smiling
weather
.
But
when
did
she
judge
amiss
?
*NL*
The
abbey
would
be
always
safe
and
dry
.
He
yielded
implicitly
,
and
*NL*
would
fetch
his
hat
and
attend
them
in
a
moment
.
''
He
left
the
room
,
*NL*
and
Catherine
,
with
a
disappointed
,
anxious
face
,
began
to
speak
of
her
*NL*
unwillingness
that
he
should
be
taking
them
out
of
doors
against
his
own
*NL*
inclination
,
under
a
mistaken
idea
of
pleasing
her
;
but
she
was
stopped
*NL*
by
Miss
Tilney
's
saying
,
with
a
little
confusion
,
``
I
believe
it
will
be
*NL*
wisest
to
take
the
morning
while
it
is
so
fine
;
and
do
not
be
uneasy
on
*NL*
my
father
's
account
;
he
always
walks
out
at
this
time
of
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Catherine
did
not
exactly
know
how
this
was
to
be
understood
.
Why
*NL*
was
Miss
Tilney
embarrassed
?
Could
there
be
any
unwillingness
on
the
*NL*
general
's
side
to
show
her
over
the
abbey
?
The
proposal
was
his
own
.
And
*NL*
was
not
it
odd
that
he
should
always
take
his
walk
so
early
?
Neither
her
*NL*
father
nor
Mr.
Allen
did
so
.
It
was
certainly
very
provoking
.
She
was
*NL*
all
impatience
to
see
the
house
,
and
had
scarcely
any
curiosity
about
*NL*
the
grounds
.
If
Henry
had
been
with
them
indeed
!
But
now
she
should
not
*NL*
know
what
was
picturesque
when
she
saw
it
.
Such
were
her
thoughts
,
but
*NL*
she
kept
them
to
herself
,
and
put
on
her
bonnet
in
patient
discontent
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
struck
,
however
,
beyond
her
expectation
,
by
the
grandeur
of
*NL*
the
abbey
,
as
she
saw
it
for
the
first
time
from
the
lawn
.
The
whole
*NL*
building
enclosed
a
large
court
;
and
two
sides
of
the
quadrangle
,
rich
*NL*
in
Gothic
ornaments
,
stood
forward
for
admiration
.
The
remainder
was
*NL*
shut
off
by
knolls
of
old
trees
,
or
luxuriant
plantations
,
and
the
steep
*NL*
woody
hills
rising
behind
,
to
give
it
shelter
,
were
beautiful
even
in
*NL*
the
leafless
month
of
March
.
Catherine
had
seen
nothing
to
compare
with
*NL*
it
;
and
her
feelings
of
delight
were
so
strong
,
that
without
waiting
for
*NL*
any
better
authority
,
she
boldly
burst
forth
in
wonder
and
praise
.
The
*NL*
general
listened
with
assenting
gratitude
;
and
it
seemed
as
if
his
own
*NL*
estimation
of
Northanger
had
waited
unfixed
till
that
hour
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
kitchen-garden
was
to
be
next
admired
,
and
he
led
the
way
to
it
*NL*
across
a
small
portion
of
the
park
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
number
of
acres
contained
in
this
garden
was
such
as
Catherine
could
*NL*
not
listen
to
without
dismay
,
being
more
than
double
the
extent
of
all
*NL*
Mr.
Allen
's
,
as
well
as
her
father
's
,
including
church-yard
and
orchard
.
*NL*
The
walls
seemed
countless
in
number
,
endless
in
length
;
a
village
of
*NL*
hot-houses
seemed
to
arise
among
them
,
and
a
whole
parish
to
be
at
*NL*
work
within
the
enclosure
.
The
general
was
flattered
by
her
looks
of
*NL*
surprise
,
which
told
him
almost
as
plainly
,
as
he
soon
forced
her
to
*NL*
tell
him
in
words
,
that
she
had
never
seen
any
gardens
at
all
equal
to
*NL*
them
before
;
and
he
then
modestly
owned
that
,
``
without
any
ambition
of
*NL*
that
sort
himself
--
without
any
solicitude
about
it
--
he
did
believe
them
*NL*
to
be
unrivalled
in
the
kingdom
.
If
he
had
a
hobby-horse
,
it
was
that
.
*NL*
He
loved
a
garden
.
Though
careless
enough
in
most
matters
of
eating
,
he
*NL*
loved
good
fruit
--
or
if
he
did
not
,
his
friends
and
children
did
.
There
*NL*
were
great
vexations
,
however
,
attending
such
a
garden
as
his
.
The
*NL*
utmost
care
could
not
always
secure
the
most
valuable
fruits
.
The
pinery
*NL*
had
yielded
only
one
hundred
in
the
last
year
.
Mr.
Allen
,
he
supposed
,
*NL*
must
feel
these
inconveniences
as
well
as
himself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
not
at
all
.
Mr.
Allen
did
not
care
about
the
garden
,
and
never
went
*NL*
into
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
a
triumphant
smile
of
self-satisfaction
,
the
general
wished
he
*NL*
could
do
the
same
,
for
he
never
entered
his
,
without
being
vexed
in
some
*NL*
way
or
other
,
by
its
falling
short
of
his
plan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
were
Mr.
Allen
's
succession-houses
worked
?
''
describing
the
nature
*NL*
of
his
own
as
they
entered
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Allen
had
only
one
small
hot-house
,
which
Mrs.
Allen
had
the
use
of
*NL*
for
her
plants
in
winter
,
and
there
was
a
fire
in
it
now
and
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
a
happy
man
!
''
said
the
general
,
with
a
look
of
very
happy
*NL*
contempt
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
taken
her
into
every
division
,
and
led
her
under
every
wall
,
till
*NL*
she
was
heartily
weary
of
seeing
and
wondering
,
he
suffered
the
girls
*NL*
at
last
to
seize
the
advantage
of
an
outer
door
,
and
then
expressing
*NL*
his
wish
to
examine
the
effect
of
some
recent
alterations
about
the
*NL*
tea-house
,
proposed
it
as
no
unpleasant
extension
of
their
walk
,
if
Miss
*NL*
Morland
were
not
tired
.
``
But
where
are
you
going
,
Eleanor
?
Why
do
you
*NL*
choose
that
cold
,
damp
path
to
it
?
Miss
Morland
will
get
wet
.
Our
best
*NL*
way
is
across
the
park
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
so
favourite
a
walk
of
mine
,
''
said
Miss
Tilney
,
``
that
I
always
*NL*
think
it
the
best
and
nearest
way
.
But
perhaps
it
may
be
damp
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
narrow
winding
path
through
a
thick
grove
of
old
Scotch
firs
;
*NL*
and
Catherine
,
struck
by
its
gloomy
aspect
,
and
eager
to
enter
it
,
*NL*
could
not
,
even
by
the
general
's
disapprobation
,
be
kept
from
stepping
*NL*
forward
.
He
perceived
her
inclination
,
and
having
again
urged
the
plea
*NL*
of
health
in
vain
,
was
too
polite
to
make
further
opposition
.
He
excused
*NL*
himself
,
however
,
from
attending
them
:
``
The
rays
of
the
sun
were
not
too
*NL*
cheerful
for
him
,
and
he
would
meet
them
by
another
course
.
''
He
turned
*NL*
away
;
and
Catherine
was
shocked
to
find
how
much
her
spirits
were
*NL*
relieved
by
the
separation
.
The
shock
,
however
,
being
less
real
than
the
*NL*
relief
,
offered
it
no
injury
;
and
she
began
to
talk
with
easy
gaiety
of
*NL*
the
delightful
melancholy
which
such
a
grove
inspired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
particularly
fond
of
this
spot
,
''
said
her
companion
,
with
a
sigh
.
*NL*
``
It
was
my
mother
's
favourite
walk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Catherine
had
never
heard
Mrs.
Tilney
mentioned
in
the
family
before
,
*NL*
and
the
interest
excited
by
this
tender
remembrance
showed
itself
*NL*
directly
in
her
altered
countenance
,
and
in
the
attentive
pause
with
*NL*
which
she
waited
for
something
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
used
to
walk
here
so
often
with
her
!
''
added
Eleanor
;
``
though
I
never
*NL*
loved
it
then
,
as
I
have
loved
it
since
.
At
that
time
indeed
I
used
to
*NL*
wonder
at
her
choice
.
But
her
memory
endears
it
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
ought
it
not
,
''
reflected
Catherine
,
``
to
endear
it
to
her
husband
?
*NL*
Yet
the
general
would
not
enter
it
.
''
Miss
Tilney
continuing
silent
,
she
*NL*
ventured
to
say
,
``
Her
death
must
have
been
a
great
affliction
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
great
and
increasing
one
,
''
replied
the
other
,
in
a
low
voice
.
``
I
was
*NL*
only
thirteen
when
it
happened
;
and
though
I
felt
my
loss
perhaps
as
*NL*
strongly
as
one
so
young
could
feel
it
,
I
did
not
,
I
could
not
,
then
*NL*
know
what
a
loss
it
was
.
''
She
stopped
for
a
moment
,
and
then
added
,
with
*NL*
great
firmness
,
``
I
have
no
sister
,
you
know
--
and
though
Henry
--
though
my
*NL*
brothers
are
very
affectionate
,
and
Henry
is
a
great
deal
here
,
which
I
*NL*
am
most
thankful
for
,
it
is
impossible
for
me
not
to
be
often
solitary
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
be
sure
you
must
miss
him
very
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
mother
would
have
been
always
present
.
A
mother
would
have
been
a
*NL*
constant
friend
;
her
influence
would
have
been
beyond
all
other
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
she
a
very
charming
woman
?
Was
she
handsome
?
Was
there
any
picture
*NL*
of
her
in
the
abbey
?
And
why
had
she
been
so
partial
to
that
grove
?
Was
*NL*
it
from
dejection
of
spirits
?
''
--
were
questions
now
eagerly
poured
forth
;
*NL*
the
first
three
received
a
ready
affirmative
,
the
two
others
were
passed
*NL*
by
;
and
Catherine
's
interest
in
the
deceased
Mrs.
Tilney
augmented
with
*NL*
every
question
,
whether
answered
or
not
.
Of
her
unhappiness
in
marriage
,
*NL*
she
felt
persuaded
.
The
general
certainly
had
been
an
unkind
husband
.
He
*NL*
did
not
love
her
walk
:
could
he
therefore
have
loved
her
?
And
besides
,
*NL*
handsome
as
he
was
,
there
was
a
something
in
the
turn
of
his
features
*NL*
which
spoke
his
not
having
behaved
well
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Her
picture
,
I
suppose
,
''
blushing
at
the
consummate
art
of
her
own
*NL*
question
,
``
hangs
in
your
father
's
room
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
it
was
intended
for
the
drawing-room
;
but
my
father
was
*NL*
dissatisfied
with
the
painting
,
and
for
some
time
it
had
no
place
.
*NL*
Soon
after
her
death
I
obtained
it
for
my
own
,
and
hung
it
in
my
*NL*
bed-chamber
--
where
I
shall
be
happy
to
show
it
you
;
it
is
very
like
.
''
*NL*
Here
was
another
proof
.
A
portrait
--
very
like
--
of
a
departed
wife
,
not
*NL*
valued
by
the
husband
!
He
must
have
been
dreadfully
cruel
to
her
!
*NL*
*NL*
Catherine
attempted
no
longer
to
hide
from
herself
the
nature
of
the
*NL*
feelings
which
,
in
spite
of
all
his
attentions
,
he
had
previously
*NL*
excited
;
and
what
had
been
terror
and
dislike
before
,
was
now
absolute
*NL*
aversion
.
Yes
,
aversion
!
His
cruelty
to
such
a
charming
woman
made
him
*NL*
odious
to
her
.
She
had
often
read
of
such
characters
,
characters
which
*NL*
Mr.
Allen
had
been
used
to
call
unnatural
and
overdrawn
;
but
here
was
*NL*
proof
positive
of
the
contrary
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
just
settled
this
point
when
the
end
of
the
path
brought
them
*NL*
directly
upon
the
general
;
and
in
spite
of
all
her
virtuous
indignation
,
*NL*
she
found
herself
again
obliged
to
walk
with
him
,
listen
to
him
,
and
*NL*
even
to
smile
when
he
smiled
.
Being
no
longer
able
,
however
,
to
receive
*NL*
pleasure
from
the
surrounding
objects
,
she
soon
began
to
walk
with
*NL*
lassitude
;
the
general
perceived
it
,
and
with
a
concern
for
her
health
,
*NL*
which
seemed
to
reproach
her
for
her
opinion
of
him
,
was
most
urgent
*NL*
for
returning
with
his
daughter
to
the
house
.
He
would
follow
them
in
*NL*
a
quarter
of
an
hour
.
Again
they
parted
--
but
Eleanor
was
called
back
in
*NL*
half
a
minute
to
receive
a
strict
charge
against
taking
her
friend
round
*NL*
the
abbey
till
his
return
.
This
second
instance
of
his
anxiety
to
delay
*NL*
what
she
so
much
wished
for
struck
Catherine
as
very
remarkable
.

CHAPTER
23
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
An
hour
passed
away
before
the
general
came
in
,
spent
,
on
the
part
of
*NL*
his
young
guest
,
in
no
very
favourable
consideration
of
his
character
.
*NL*
``
This
lengthened
absence
,
these
solitary
rambles
,
did
not
speak
a
mind
*NL*
at
ease
,
or
a
conscience
void
of
reproach
.
''
At
length
he
appeared
;
and
,
*NL*
whatever
might
have
been
the
gloom
of
his
meditations
,
he
could
still
*NL*
smile
with
them
.
Miss
Tilney
,
understanding
in
part
her
friend
's
*NL*
curiosity
to
see
the
house
,
soon
revived
the
subject
;
and
her
father
*NL*
being
,
contrary
to
Catherine
's
expectations
,
unprovided
with
any
*NL*
pretence
for
further
delay
,
beyond
that
of
stopping
five
minutes
to
*NL*
order
refreshments
to
be
in
the
room
by
their
return
,
was
at
last
ready
*NL*
to
escort
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
set
forward
;
and
,
with
a
grandeur
of
air
,
a
dignified
step
,
*NL*
which
caught
the
eye
,
but
could
not
shake
the
doubts
of
the
well-read
*NL*
Catherine
,
he
led
the
way
across
the
hall
,
through
the
common
*NL*
drawing-room
and
one
useless
antechamber
,
into
a
room
magnificent
both
*NL*
in
size
and
furniture
--
the
real
drawing-room
,
used
only
with
company
of
*NL*
consequence
.
It
was
very
noble
--
very
grand
--
very
charming
!
--
was
all
that
*NL*
Catherine
had
to
say
,
for
her
indiscriminating
eye
scarcely
discerned
*NL*
the
colour
of
the
satin
;
and
all
minuteness
of
praise
,
all
praise
*NL*
that
had
much
meaning
,
was
supplied
by
the
general
:
the
costliness
or
*NL*
elegance
of
any
room
's
fitting-up
could
be
nothing
to
her
;
she
cared
for
*NL*
no
furniture
of
a
more
modern
date
than
the
fifteenth
century
.
When
the
*NL*
general
had
satisfied
his
own
curiosity
,
in
a
close
examination
of
every
*NL*
well-known
ornament
,
they
proceeded
into
the
library
,
an
apartment
,
in
*NL*
its
way
,
of
equal
magnificence
,
exhibiting
a
collection
of
books
,
on
*NL*
which
an
humble
man
might
have
looked
with
pride
.
Catherine
heard
,
*NL*
admired
,
and
wondered
with
more
genuine
feeling
than
before
--
gathered
*NL*
all
that
she
could
from
this
storehouse
of
knowledge
,
by
running
over
*NL*
the
titles
of
half
a
shelf
,
and
was
ready
to
proceed
.
But
suites
of
*NL*
apartments
did
not
spring
up
with
her
wishes
.
Large
as
was
the
building
,
*NL*
she
had
already
visited
the
greatest
part
;
though
,
on
being
told
that
,
*NL*
with
the
addition
of
the
kitchen
,
the
six
or
seven
rooms
she
had
now
*NL*
seen
surrounded
three
sides
of
the
court
,
she
could
scarcely
believe
it
,
*NL*
or
overcome
the
suspicion
of
there
being
many
chambers
secreted
.
It
was
*NL*
some
relief
,
however
,
that
they
were
to
return
to
the
rooms
in
common
*NL*
use
,
by
passing
through
a
few
of
less
importance
,
looking
into
the
*NL*
court
,
which
,
with
occasional
passages
,
not
wholly
unintricate
,
*NL*
connected
the
different
sides
;
and
she
was
further
soothed
in
her
*NL*
progress
by
being
told
that
she
was
treading
what
had
once
been
a
*NL*
cloister
,
having
traces
of
cells
pointed
out
,
and
observing
several
*NL*
doors
that
were
neither
opened
nor
explained
to
her
--
by
finding
herself
*NL*
successively
in
a
billiard-room
,
and
in
the
general
's
private
apartment
,
*NL*
without
comprehending
their
connection
,
or
being
able
to
turn
aright
*NL*
when
she
left
them
;
and
lastly
,
by
passing
through
a
dark
little
room
,
*NL*
owning
Henry
's
authority
,
and
strewed
with
his
litter
of
books
,
guns
,
*NL*
and
greatcoats
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
dining-room
,
of
which
,
though
already
seen
,
and
always
to
be
*NL*
seen
at
five
o'clock
,
the
general
could
not
forgo
the
pleasure
of
pacing
*NL*
out
the
length
,
for
the
more
certain
information
of
Miss
Morland
,
as
*NL*
to
what
she
neither
doubted
nor
cared
for
,
they
proceeded
by
quick
*NL*
communication
to
the
kitchen
--
the
ancient
kitchen
of
the
convent
,
rich
*NL*
in
the
massy
walls
and
smoke
of
former
days
,
and
in
the
stoves
and
hot
*NL*
closets
of
the
present
.
The
general
's
improving
hand
had
not
loitered
*NL*
here
:
every
modern
invention
to
facilitate
the
labour
of
the
cooks
had
*NL*
been
adopted
within
this
,
their
spacious
theatre
;
and
,
when
the
genius
*NL*
of
others
had
failed
,
his
own
had
often
produced
the
perfection
wanted
.
*NL*
His
endowments
of
this
spot
alone
might
at
any
time
have
placed
him
high
*NL*
among
the
benefactors
of
the
convent
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
the
walls
of
the
kitchen
ended
all
the
antiquity
of
the
abbey
;
the
*NL*
fourth
side
of
the
quadrangle
having
,
on
account
of
its
decaying
state
,
*NL*
been
removed
by
the
general
's
father
,
and
the
present
erected
in
its
*NL*
place
.
All
that
was
venerable
ceased
here
.
The
new
building
was
not
*NL*
only
new
,
but
declared
itself
to
be
so
;
intended
only
for
offices
,
and
*NL*
enclosed
behind
by
stable-yards
,
no
uniformity
of
architecture
had
been
*NL*
thought
necessary
.
Catherine
could
have
raved
at
the
hand
which
had
*NL*
swept
away
what
must
have
been
beyond
the
value
of
all
the
rest
,
for
the
*NL*
purposes
of
mere
domestic
economy
;
and
would
willingly
have
been
spared
*NL*
the
mortification
of
a
walk
through
scenes
so
fallen
,
had
the
general
*NL*
allowed
it
;
but
if
he
had
a
vanity
,
it
was
in
the
arrangement
of
his
*NL*
offices
;
and
as
he
was
convinced
that
,
to
a
mind
like
Miss
Morland
's
,
*NL*
a
view
of
the
accommodations
and
comforts
,
by
which
the
labours
of
her
*NL*
inferiors
were
softened
,
must
always
be
gratifying
,
he
should
make
*NL*
no
apology
for
leading
her
on
.
They
took
a
slight
survey
of
all
;
and
*NL*
Catherine
was
impressed
,
beyond
her
expectation
,
by
their
multiplicity
*NL*
and
their
convenience
.
The
purposes
for
which
a
few
shapeless
pantries
*NL*
and
a
comfortless
scullery
were
deemed
sufficient
at
Fullerton
,
were
*NL*
here
carried
on
in
appropriate
divisions
,
commodious
and
roomy
.
The
*NL*
number
of
servants
continually
appearing
did
not
strike
her
less
than
*NL*
the
number
of
their
offices
.
Wherever
they
went
,
some
pattened
girl
*NL*
stopped
to
curtsy
,
or
some
footman
in
dishabille
sneaked
off
.
Yet
this
*NL*
was
an
abbey
!
How
inexpressibly
different
in
these
domestic
arrangements
*NL*
from
such
as
she
had
read
about
--
from
abbeys
and
castles
,
in
which
,
*NL*
though
certainly
larger
than
Northanger
,
all
the
dirty
work
of
the
house
*NL*
was
to
be
done
by
two
pair
of
female
hands
at
the
utmost
.
How
they
could
*NL*
get
through
it
all
had
often
amazed
Mrs.
Allen
;
and
,
when
Catherine
saw
*NL*
what
was
necessary
here
,
she
began
to
be
amazed
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
returned
to
the
hall
,
that
the
chief
staircase
might
be
ascended
,
*NL*
and
the
beauty
of
its
wood
,
and
ornaments
of
rich
carving
might
be
*NL*
pointed
out
:
having
gained
the
top
,
they
turned
in
an
opposite
direction
*NL*
from
the
gallery
in
which
her
room
lay
,
and
shortly
entered
one
on
*NL*
the
same
plan
,
but
superior
in
length
and
breadth
.
She
was
here
shown
*NL*
successively
into
three
large
bed-chambers
,
with
their
dressing-rooms
,
*NL*
most
completely
and
handsomely
fitted
up
;
everything
that
money
and
*NL*
taste
could
do
,
to
give
comfort
and
elegance
to
apartments
,
had
been
*NL*
bestowed
on
these
;
and
,
being
furnished
within
the
last
five
years
,
they
*NL*
were
perfect
in
all
that
would
be
generally
pleasing
,
and
wanting
in
all
*NL*
that
could
give
pleasure
to
Catherine
.
As
they
were
surveying
the
last
,
*NL*
the
general
,
after
slightly
naming
a
few
of
the
distinguished
characters
*NL*
by
whom
they
had
at
times
been
honoured
,
turned
with
a
smiling
*NL*
countenance
to
Catherine
,
and
ventured
to
hope
that
henceforward
some
of
*NL*
their
earliest
tenants
might
be
``
our
friends
from
Fullerton
.
''
She
felt
*NL*
the
unexpected
compliment
,
and
deeply
regretted
the
impossibility
of
*NL*
thinking
well
of
a
man
so
kindly
disposed
towards
herself
,
and
so
full
*NL*
of
civility
to
all
her
family
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
gallery
was
terminated
by
folding
doors
,
which
Miss
Tilney
,
*NL*
advancing
,
had
thrown
open
,
and
passed
through
,
and
seemed
on
the
point
*NL*
of
doing
the
same
by
the
first
door
to
the
left
,
in
another
long
reach
*NL*
of
gallery
,
when
the
general
,
coming
forwards
,
called
her
hastily
,
and
,
*NL*
as
Catherine
thought
,
rather
angrily
back
,
demanding
whether
she
were
*NL*
going
?
--
And
what
was
there
more
to
be
seen
?
--
Had
not
Miss
Morland
*NL*
already
seen
all
that
could
be
worth
her
notice
?
--
And
did
she
not
*NL*
suppose
her
friend
might
be
glad
of
some
refreshment
after
so
much
*NL*
exercise
?
Miss
Tilney
drew
back
directly
,
and
the
heavy
doors
were
*NL*
closed
upon
the
mortified
Catherine
,
who
,
having
seen
,
in
a
momentary
*NL*
glance
beyond
them
,
a
narrower
passage
,
more
numerous
openings
,
and
*NL*
symptoms
of
a
winding
staircase
,
believed
herself
at
last
within
the
*NL*
reach
of
something
worth
her
notice
;
and
felt
,
as
she
unwillingly
paced
*NL*
back
the
gallery
,
that
she
would
rather
be
allowed
to
examine
that
end
*NL*
of
the
house
than
see
all
the
finery
of
all
the
rest
.
The
general
's
*NL*
evident
desire
of
preventing
such
an
examination
was
an
additional
*NL*
stimulant
.
Something
was
certainly
to
be
concealed
;
her
fancy
,
though
*NL*
it
had
trespassed
lately
once
or
twice
,
could
not
mislead
her
here
;
*NL*
and
what
that
something
was
,
a
short
sentence
of
Miss
Tilney
's
,
as
they
*NL*
followed
the
general
at
some
distance
downstairs
,
seemed
to
point
out
:
*NL*
``
I
was
going
to
take
you
into
what
was
my
mother
's
room
--
the
room
*NL*
in
which
she
died
--
''
were
all
her
words
;
but
few
as
they
were
,
they
*NL*
conveyed
pages
of
intelligence
to
Catherine
.
It
was
no
wonder
that
the
*NL*
general
should
shrink
from
the
sight
of
such
objects
as
that
room
*NL*
must
contain
;
a
room
in
all
probability
never
entered
by
him
since
the
*NL*
dreadful
scene
had
passed
,
which
released
his
suffering
wife
,
and
left
*NL*
him
to
the
stings
of
conscience
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
ventured
,
when
next
alone
with
Eleanor
,
to
express
her
wish
of
being
*NL*
permitted
to
see
it
,
as
well
as
all
the
rest
of
that
side
of
the
house
;
*NL*
and
Eleanor
promised
to
attend
her
there
,
whenever
they
should
have
a
*NL*
convenient
hour
.
Catherine
understood
her
:
the
general
must
be
watched
*NL*
from
home
,
before
that
room
could
be
entered
.
``
It
remains
as
it
was
,
I
*NL*
suppose
?
''
said
she
,
in
a
tone
of
feeling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
entirely
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
long
ago
may
it
be
that
your
mother
died
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
has
been
dead
these
nine
years
.
''
And
nine
years
,
Catherine
knew
,
*NL*
was
a
trifle
of
time
,
compared
with
what
generally
elapsed
after
the
*NL*
death
of
an
injured
wife
,
before
her
room
was
put
to
rights
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
were
with
her
,
I
suppose
,
to
the
last
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Miss
Tilney
,
sighing
;
``
I
was
unfortunately
from
home
.
Her
*NL*
illness
was
sudden
and
short
;
and
,
before
I
arrived
it
was
all
over
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Catherine
's
blood
ran
cold
with
the
horrid
suggestions
which
naturally
*NL*
sprang
from
these
words
.
Could
it
be
possible
?
Could
Henry
's
father
--
?
*NL*
And
yet
how
many
were
the
examples
to
justify
even
the
blackest
*NL*
suspicions
!
And
,
when
she
saw
him
in
the
evening
,
while
she
worked
*NL*
with
her
friend
,
slowly
pacing
the
drawing-room
for
an
hour
together
in
*NL*
silent
thoughtfulness
,
with
downcast
eyes
and
contracted
brow
,
she
felt
*NL*
secure
from
all
possibility
of
wronging
him
.
It
was
the
air
and
attitude
*NL*
of
a
Montoni
!
What
could
more
plainly
speak
the
gloomy
workings
of
a
*NL*
mind
not
wholly
dead
to
every
sense
of
humanity
,
in
its
fearful
review
*NL*
of
past
scenes
of
guilt
?
Unhappy
man
!
And
the
anxiousness
of
her
spirits
*NL*
directed
her
eyes
towards
his
figure
so
repeatedly
,
as
to
catch
Miss
*NL*
Tilney
's
notice
.
``
My
father
,
''
she
whispered
,
``
often
walks
about
the
room
*NL*
in
this
way
;
it
is
nothing
unusual
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
much
the
worse
!
''
thought
Catherine
;
such
ill-timed
exercise
was
of
a
*NL*
piece
with
the
strange
unseasonableness
of
his
morning
walks
,
and
boded
*NL*
nothing
good
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
an
evening
,
the
little
variety
and
seeming
length
of
which
made
*NL*
her
peculiarly
sensible
of
Henry
's
importance
among
them
,
she
was
*NL*
heartily
glad
to
be
dismissed
;
though
it
was
a
look
from
the
general
not
*NL*
designed
for
her
observation
which
sent
his
daughter
to
the
bell
.
*NL*
When
the
butler
would
have
lit
his
master
's
candle
,
however
,
he
was
*NL*
forbidden
.
The
latter
was
not
going
to
retire
.
``
I
have
many
pamphlets
to
*NL*
finish
,
''
said
he
to
Catherine
,
``
before
I
can
close
my
eyes
,
and
perhaps
*NL*
may
be
poring
over
the
affairs
of
the
nation
for
hours
after
you
are
*NL*
asleep
.
Can
either
of
us
be
more
meetly
employed
?
My
eyes
will
be
*NL*
blinding
for
the
good
of
others
,
and
yours
preparing
by
rest
for
future
*NL*
mischief
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
neither
the
business
alleged
,
nor
the
magnificent
compliment
,
*NL*
could
win
Catherine
from
thinking
that
some
very
different
object
must
*NL*
occasion
so
serious
a
delay
of
proper
repose
.
To
be
kept
up
for
hours
,
*NL*
after
the
family
were
in
bed
,
by
stupid
pamphlets
was
not
very
likely
.
*NL*
There
must
be
some
deeper
cause
:
something
was
to
be
done
which
could
*NL*
be
done
only
while
the
household
slept
;
and
the
probability
that
Mrs.
*NL*
Tilney
yet
lived
,
shut
up
for
causes
unknown
,
and
receiving
from
the
*NL*
pitiless
hands
of
her
husband
a
nightly
supply
of
coarse
food
,
was
the
*NL*
conclusion
which
necessarily
followed
.
Shocking
as
was
the
idea
,
it
*NL*
was
at
least
better
than
a
death
unfairly
hastened
,
as
,
in
the
natural
*NL*
course
of
things
,
she
must
ere
long
be
released
.
The
suddenness
of
her
*NL*
reputed
illness
,
the
absence
of
her
daughter
,
and
probably
of
her
other
*NL*
children
,
at
the
time
--
all
favoured
the
supposition
of
her
imprisonment
.
*NL*
Its
origin
--
jealousy
perhaps
,
or
wanton
cruelty
--
was
yet
to
be
*NL*
unravelled
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
revolving
these
matters
,
while
she
undressed
,
it
suddenly
struck
her
*NL*
as
not
unlikely
that
she
might
that
morning
have
passed
near
the
very
*NL*
spot
of
this
unfortunate
woman
's
confinement
--
might
have
been
within
*NL*
a
few
paces
of
the
cell
in
which
she
languished
out
her
days
;
for
what
*NL*
part
of
the
abbey
could
be
more
fitted
for
the
purpose
than
that
which
*NL*
yet
bore
the
traces
of
monastic
division
?
In
the
high-arched
passage
,
*NL*
paved
with
stone
,
which
already
she
had
trodden
with
peculiar
awe
,
she
*NL*
well
remembered
the
doors
of
which
the
general
had
given
no
account
.
To
*NL*
what
might
not
those
doors
lead
?
In
support
of
the
plausibility
of
this
*NL*
conjecture
,
it
further
occurred
to
her
that
the
forbidden
gallery
,
in
*NL*
which
lay
the
apartments
of
the
unfortunate
Mrs.
Tilney
,
must
be
,
as
*NL*
certainly
as
her
memory
could
guide
her
,
exactly
over
this
suspected
*NL*
range
of
cells
,
and
the
staircase
by
the
side
of
those
apartments
of
*NL*
which
she
had
caught
a
transient
glimpse
,
communicating
by
some
*NL*
secret
means
with
those
cells
,
might
well
have
favoured
the
barbarous
*NL*
proceedings
of
her
husband
.
Down
that
staircase
she
had
perhaps
been
*NL*
conveyed
in
a
state
of
well-prepared
insensibility
!
*NL*
*NL*
Catherine
sometimes
started
at
the
boldness
of
her
own
surmises
,
and
*NL*
sometimes
hoped
or
feared
that
she
had
gone
too
far
;
but
they
were
*NL*
supported
by
such
appearances
as
made
their
dismissal
impossible
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
side
of
the
quadrangle
,
in
which
she
supposed
the
guilty
scene
to
be
*NL*
acting
,
being
,
according
to
her
belief
,
just
opposite
her
own
,
it
struck
*NL*
her
that
,
if
judiciously
watched
,
some
rays
of
light
from
the
general
's
*NL*
lamp
might
glimmer
through
the
lower
windows
,
as
he
passed
to
the
prison
*NL*
of
his
wife
;
and
,
twice
before
she
stepped
into
bed
,
she
stole
gently
*NL*
from
her
room
to
the
corresponding
window
in
the
gallery
,
to
see
if
it
*NL*
appeared
;
but
all
abroad
was
dark
,
and
it
must
yet
be
too
early
.
The
*NL*
various
ascending
noises
convinced
her
that
the
servants
must
still
be
*NL*
up
.
Till
midnight
,
she
supposed
it
would
be
in
vain
to
watch
;
but
then
,
*NL*
when
the
clock
had
struck
twelve
,
and
all
was
quiet
,
she
would
,
if
not
*NL*
quite
appalled
by
darkness
,
steal
out
and
look
once
more
.
The
clock
*NL*
struck
twelve
--
and
Catherine
had
been
half
an
hour
asleep
.
*NL*
*NL*

CHAPTER
24
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
afforded
no
opportunity
for
the
proposed
examination
of
the
*NL*
mysterious
apartments
.
It
was
Sunday
,
and
the
whole
time
between
morning
*NL*
and
afternoon
service
was
required
by
the
general
in
exercise
abroad
or
*NL*
eating
cold
meat
at
home
;
and
great
as
was
Catherine
's
curiosity
,
her
*NL*
courage
was
not
equal
to
a
wish
of
exploring
them
after
dinner
,
either
*NL*
by
the
fading
light
of
the
sky
between
six
and
seven
o'clock
,
or
by
the
*NL*
yet
more
partial
though
stronger
illumination
of
a
treacherous
lamp
.
*NL*
The
day
was
unmarked
therefore
by
anything
to
interest
her
imagination
*NL*
beyond
the
sight
of
a
very
elegant
monument
to
the
memory
of
Mrs.
*NL*
Tilney
,
which
immediately
fronted
the
family
pew
.
By
that
her
eye
*NL*
was
instantly
caught
and
long
retained
;
and
the
perusal
of
the
highly
*NL*
strained
epitaph
,
in
which
every
virtue
was
ascribed
to
her
by
the
*NL*
inconsolable
husband
,
who
must
have
been
in
some
way
or
other
her
*NL*
destroyer
,
affected
her
even
to
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
the
general
,
having
erected
such
a
monument
,
should
be
able
to
face
*NL*
it
,
was
not
perhaps
very
strange
,
and
yet
that
he
could
sit
so
boldly
*NL*
collected
within
its
view
,
maintain
so
elevated
an
air
,
look
so
*NL*
fearlessly
around
,
nay
,
that
he
should
even
enter
the
church
,
seemed
*NL*
wonderful
to
Catherine
.
Not
,
however
,
that
many
instances
of
beings
*NL*
equally
hardened
in
guilt
might
not
be
produced
.
She
could
remember
*NL*
dozens
who
had
persevered
in
every
possible
vice
,
going
on
from
crime
to
*NL*
crime
,
murdering
whomsoever
they
chose
,
without
any
feeling
of
humanity
*NL*
or
remorse
;
till
a
violent
death
or
a
religious
retirement
closed
their
*NL*
black
career
.
The
erection
of
the
monument
itself
could
not
in
the
*NL*
smallest
degree
affect
her
doubts
of
Mrs.
Tilney
's
actual
decease
.
Were
*NL*
she
even
to
descend
into
the
family
vault
where
her
ashes
were
supposed
*NL*
to
slumber
,
were
she
to
behold
the
coffin
in
which
they
were
said
to
*NL*
be
enclosed
--
what
could
it
avail
in
such
a
case
?
Catherine
had
read
too
*NL*
much
not
to
be
perfectly
aware
of
the
ease
with
which
a
waxen
figure
*NL*
might
be
introduced
,
and
a
supposititious
funeral
carried
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
succeeding
morning
promised
something
better
.
The
general
's
early
*NL*
walk
,
ill-timed
as
it
was
in
every
other
view
,
was
favourable
here
;
and
*NL*
when
she
knew
him
to
be
out
of
the
house
,
she
directly
proposed
to
Miss
*NL*
Tilney
the
accomplishment
of
her
promise
.
Eleanor
was
ready
to
oblige
*NL*
her
;
and
Catherine
reminding
her
as
they
went
of
another
promise
,
their
*NL*
first
visit
in
consequence
was
to
the
portrait
in
her
bed-chamber
.
It
*NL*
represented
a
very
lovely
woman
,
with
a
mild
and
pensive
countenance
,
*NL*
justifying
,
so
far
,
the
expectations
of
its
new
observer
;
but
they
were
*NL*
not
in
every
respect
answered
,
for
Catherine
had
depended
upon
meeting
*NL*
with
features
,
hair
,
complexion
,
that
should
be
the
very
counterpart
,
*NL*
the
very
image
,
if
not
of
Henry
's
,
of
Eleanor
's
--
the
only
portraits
of
*NL*
which
she
had
been
in
the
habit
of
thinking
,
bearing
always
an
equal
*NL*
resemblance
of
mother
and
child
.
A
face
once
taken
was
taken
for
*NL*
generations
.
But
here
she
was
obliged
to
look
and
consider
and
study
*NL*
for
a
likeness
.
She
contemplated
it
,
however
,
in
spite
of
this
drawback
,
*NL*
with
much
emotion
,
and
,
but
for
a
yet
stronger
interest
,
would
have
left
*NL*
it
unwillingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
agitation
as
they
entered
the
great
gallery
was
too
much
for
any
*NL*
endeavour
at
discourse
;
she
could
only
look
at
her
companion
.
Eleanor
's
*NL*
countenance
was
dejected
,
yet
sedate
;
and
its
composure
spoke
her
inured
*NL*
to
all
the
gloomy
objects
to
which
they
were
advancing
.
Again
she
passed
*NL*
through
the
folding
doors
,
again
her
hand
was
upon
the
important
lock
,
*NL*
and
Catherine
,
hardly
able
to
breathe
,
was
turning
to
close
the
former
*NL*
with
fearful
caution
,
when
the
figure
,
the
dreaded
figure
of
the
general
*NL*
himself
at
the
further
end
of
the
gallery
,
stood
before
her
!
The
name
of
*NL*
``
Eleanor
''
at
the
same
moment
,
in
his
loudest
tone
,
resounded
through
the
*NL*
building
,
giving
to
his
daughter
the
first
intimation
of
his
presence
,
*NL*
and
to
Catherine
terror
upon
terror
.
An
attempt
at
concealment
had
been
*NL*
her
first
instinctive
movement
on
perceiving
him
,
yet
she
could
*NL*
scarcely
hope
to
have
escaped
his
eye
;
and
when
her
friend
,
who
with
an
*NL*
apologizing
look
darted
hastily
by
her
,
had
joined
and
disappeared
*NL*
with
him
,
she
ran
for
safety
to
her
own
room
,
and
,
locking
herself
*NL*
in
,
believed
that
she
should
never
have
courage
to
go
down
again
.
She
*NL*
remained
there
at
least
an
hour
,
in
the
greatest
agitation
,
deeply
*NL*
commiserating
the
state
of
her
poor
friend
,
and
expecting
a
summons
*NL*
herself
from
the
angry
general
to
attend
him
in
his
own
apartment
.
No
*NL*
summons
,
however
,
arrived
;
and
at
last
,
on
seeing
a
carriage
drive
up
*NL*
to
the
abbey
,
she
was
emboldened
to
descend
and
meet
him
under
the
*NL*
protection
of
visitors
.
The
breakfast-room
was
gay
with
company
;
and
*NL*
she
was
named
to
them
by
the
general
as
the
friend
of
his
daughter
,
in
*NL*
a
complimentary
style
,
which
so
well
concealed
his
resentful
ire
,
as
to
*NL*
make
her
feel
secure
at
least
of
life
for
the
present
.
And
Eleanor
,
*NL*
with
a
command
of
countenance
which
did
honour
to
her
concern
for
his
*NL*
character
,
taking
an
early
occasion
of
saying
to
her
,
``
My
father
only
*NL*
wanted
me
to
answer
a
note
,
''
she
began
to
hope
that
she
had
either
been
*NL*
unseen
by
the
general
,
or
that
from
some
consideration
of
policy
she
*NL*
should
be
allowed
to
suppose
herself
so
.
Upon
this
trust
she
dared
still
*NL*
to
remain
in
his
presence
,
after
the
company
left
them
,
and
nothing
*NL*
occurred
to
disturb
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
course
of
this
morning
's
reflections
,
she
came
to
a
resolution
*NL*
of
making
her
next
attempt
on
the
forbidden
door
alone
.
It
would
be
much
*NL*
better
in
every
respect
that
Eleanor
should
know
nothing
of
the
matter
.
*NL*
To
involve
her
in
the
danger
of
a
second
detection
,
to
court
her
into
*NL*
an
apartment
which
must
wring
her
heart
,
could
not
be
the
office
of
a
*NL*
friend
.
The
general
's
utmost
anger
could
not
be
to
herself
what
it
might
*NL*
be
to
a
daughter
;
and
,
besides
,
she
thought
the
examination
itself
*NL*
would
be
more
satisfactory
if
made
without
any
companion
.
It
would
be
*NL*
impossible
to
explain
to
Eleanor
the
suspicions
,
from
which
the
other
*NL*
had
,
in
all
likelihood
,
been
hitherto
happily
exempt
;
nor
could
she
*NL*
therefore
,
in
her
presence
,
search
for
those
proofs
of
the
general
's
*NL*
cruelty
,
which
however
they
might
yet
have
escaped
discovery
,
she
felt
*NL*
confident
of
somewhere
drawing
forth
,
in
the
shape
of
some
fragmented
*NL*
journal
,
continued
to
the
last
gasp
.
Of
the
way
to
the
apartment
she
was
*NL*
now
perfectly
mistress
;
and
as
she
wished
to
get
it
over
before
Henry
's
*NL*
return
,
who
was
expected
on
the
morrow
,
there
was
no
time
to
be
lost
.
*NL*
The
day
was
bright
,
her
courage
high
;
at
four
o'clock
,
the
sun
was
now
*NL*
two
hours
above
the
horizon
,
and
it
would
be
only
her
retiring
to
dress
*NL*
half
an
hour
earlier
than
usual
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
done
;
and
Catherine
found
herself
alone
in
the
gallery
before
the
*NL*
clocks
had
ceased
to
strike
.
It
was
no
time
for
thought
;
she
hurried
*NL*
on
,
slipped
with
the
least
possible
noise
through
the
folding
doors
,
*NL*
and
without
stopping
to
look
or
breathe
,
rushed
forward
to
the
one
in
*NL*
question
.
The
lock
yielded
to
her
hand
,
and
,
luckily
,
with
no
sullen
*NL*
sound
that
could
alarm
a
human
being
.
On
tiptoe
she
entered
;
the
room
*NL*
was
before
her
;
but
it
was
some
minutes
before
she
could
advance
another
*NL*
step
.
She
beheld
what
fixed
her
to
the
spot
and
agitated
every
feature
.
*NL*
She
saw
a
large
,
well-proportioned
apartment
,
an
handsome
dimity
bed
,
*NL*
arranged
as
unoccupied
with
an
housemaid
's
care
,
a
bright
Bath
stove
,
*NL*
mahogany
wardrobes
,
and
neatly
painted
chairs
,
on
which
the
warm
beams
*NL*
of
a
western
sun
gaily
poured
through
two
sash
windows
!
Catherine
had
*NL*
expected
to
have
her
feelings
worked
,
and
worked
they
were
.
Astonishment
*NL*
and
doubt
first
seized
them
;
and
a
shortly
succeeding
ray
of
common
*NL*
sense
added
some
bitter
emotions
of
shame
.
She
could
not
be
mistaken
*NL*
as
to
the
room
;
but
how
grossly
mistaken
in
everything
else
!
--
in
Miss
*NL*
Tilney
's
meaning
,
in
her
own
calculation
!
This
apartment
,
to
which
she
*NL*
had
given
a
date
so
ancient
,
a
position
so
awful
,
proved
to
be
one
end
*NL*
of
what
the
general
's
father
had
built
.
There
were
two
other
doors
in
*NL*
the
chamber
,
leading
probably
into
dressing-closets
;
but
she
had
no
*NL*
inclination
to
open
either
.
Would
the
veil
in
which
Mrs.
Tilney
had
last
*NL*
walked
,
or
the
volume
in
which
she
had
last
read
,
remain
to
tell
what
*NL*
nothing
else
was
allowed
to
whisper
?
No
:
whatever
might
have
been
the
*NL*
general
's
crimes
,
he
had
certainly
too
much
wit
to
let
them
sue
for
*NL*
detection
.
She
was
sick
of
exploring
,
and
desired
but
to
be
safe
in
her
*NL*
own
room
,
with
her
own
heart
only
privy
to
its
folly
;
and
she
was
on
*NL*
the
point
of
retreating
as
softly
as
she
had
entered
,
when
the
sound
of
*NL*
footsteps
,
she
could
hardly
tell
where
,
made
her
pause
and
tremble
.
*NL*
To
be
found
there
,
even
by
a
servant
,
would
be
unpleasant
;
but
by
the
*NL*
general
-LRB-
and
he
seemed
always
at
hand
when
least
wanted
-RRB-
,
much
worse
!
*NL*
She
listened
--
the
sound
had
ceased
;
and
resolving
not
to
lose
a
*NL*
moment
,
she
passed
through
and
closed
the
door
.
At
that
instant
a
door
*NL*
underneath
was
hastily
opened
;
someone
seemed
with
swift
steps
to
ascend
*NL*
the
stairs
,
by
the
head
of
which
she
had
yet
to
pass
before
she
could
*NL*
gain
the
gallery
.
She
had
no
power
to
move
.
With
a
feeling
of
terror
*NL*
not
very
definable
,
she
fixed
her
eyes
on
the
staircase
,
and
in
a
few
*NL*
moments
it
gave
Henry
to
her
view
.
``
Mr.
Tilney
!
''
she
exclaimed
in
a
*NL*
voice
of
more
than
common
astonishment
.
He
looked
astonished
too
.
``
Good
*NL*
God
!
''
she
continued
,
not
attending
to
his
address
.
``
How
came
you
here
?
*NL*
How
came
you
up
that
staircase
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
came
I
up
that
staircase
!
''
he
replied
,
greatly
surprised
.
``
Because
*NL*
it
is
my
nearest
way
from
the
stable-yard
to
my
own
chamber
;
and
why
*NL*
should
I
not
come
up
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Catherine
recollected
herself
,
blushed
deeply
,
and
could
say
no
more
.
He
*NL*
seemed
to
be
looking
in
her
countenance
for
that
explanation
which
her
*NL*
lips
did
not
afford
.
She
moved
on
towards
the
gallery
.
``
And
may
I
not
,
*NL*
in
my
turn
,
''
said
he
,
as
he
pushed
back
the
folding
doors
,
``
ask
how
you
*NL*
came
here
?
This
passage
is
at
least
as
extraordinary
a
road
from
the
*NL*
breakfast-parlour
to
your
apartment
,
as
that
staircase
can
be
from
the
*NL*
stables
to
mine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
been
,
''
said
Catherine
,
looking
down
,
``
to
see
your
mother
's
*NL*
room
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
mother
's
room
!
Is
there
anything
extraordinary
to
be
seen
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
nothing
at
all
.
I
thought
you
did
not
mean
to
come
back
till
*NL*
tomorrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
not
expect
to
be
able
to
return
sooner
,
when
I
went
away
;
but
*NL*
three
hours
ago
I
had
the
pleasure
of
finding
nothing
to
detain
me
.
You
*NL*
look
pale
.
I
am
afraid
I
alarmed
you
by
running
so
fast
up
those
stairs
.
*NL*
Perhaps
you
did
not
know
--
you
were
not
aware
of
their
leading
from
the
*NL*
offices
in
common
use
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
was
not
.
You
have
had
a
very
fine
day
for
your
ride
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
;
and
does
Eleanor
leave
you
to
find
your
way
into
all
the
rooms
in
*NL*
the
house
by
yourself
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
No
;
she
showed
me
over
the
greatest
part
on
Saturday
--
and
we
were
*NL*
coming
here
to
these
rooms
--
but
only
''
--
dropping
her
voice
--
``
your
father
*NL*
was
with
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
that
prevented
you
,
''
said
Henry
,
earnestly
regarding
her
.
``
Have
you
*NL*
looked
into
all
the
rooms
in
that
passage
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
only
wanted
to
see
--
Is
not
it
very
late
?
I
must
go
and
dress
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
only
a
quarter
past
four
''
showing
his
watch
--
``
and
you
are
not
now
*NL*
in
Bath
.
No
theatre
,
no
rooms
to
prepare
for
.
Half
an
hour
at
Northanger
*NL*
must
be
enough
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
could
not
contradict
it
,
and
therefore
suffered
herself
to
be
*NL*
detained
,
though
her
dread
of
further
questions
made
her
,
for
the
first
*NL*
time
in
their
acquaintance
,
wish
to
leave
him
.
They
walked
slowly
up
the
*NL*
gallery
.
``
Have
you
had
any
letter
from
Bath
since
I
saw
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
and
I
am
very
much
surprised
.
Isabella
promised
so
faithfully
to
*NL*
write
directly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Promised
so
faithfully
!
A
faithful
promise
!
That
puzzles
me
.
I
have
*NL*
heard
of
a
faithful
performance
.
But
a
faithful
promise
--
the
fidelity
*NL*
of
promising
!
It
is
a
power
little
worth
knowing
,
however
,
since
it
can
*NL*
deceive
and
pain
you
.
My
mother
's
room
is
very
commodious
,
is
it
not
?
*NL*
Large
and
cheerful-looking
,
and
the
dressing-closets
so
well
disposed
!
*NL*
It
always
strikes
me
as
the
most
comfortable
apartment
in
the
house
,
and
*NL*
I
rather
wonder
that
Eleanor
should
not
take
it
for
her
own
.
She
sent
*NL*
you
to
look
at
it
,
I
suppose
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
has
been
your
own
doing
entirely
?
''
Catherine
said
nothing
.
After
a
*NL*
short
silence
,
during
which
he
had
closely
observed
her
,
he
added
,
``
As
*NL*
there
is
nothing
in
the
room
in
itself
to
raise
curiosity
,
this
must
*NL*
have
proceeded
from
a
sentiment
of
respect
for
my
mother
's
character
,
*NL*
as
described
by
Eleanor
,
which
does
honour
to
her
memory
.
The
world
,
I
*NL*
believe
,
never
saw
a
better
woman
.
But
it
is
not
often
that
virtue
can
*NL*
boast
an
interest
such
as
this
.
The
domestic
,
unpretending
merits
of
a
*NL*
person
never
known
do
not
often
create
that
kind
of
fervent
,
venerating
*NL*
tenderness
which
would
prompt
a
visit
like
yours
.
Eleanor
,
I
suppose
,
*NL*
has
talked
of
her
a
great
deal
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
a
great
deal
.
That
is
--
no
,
not
much
,
but
what
she
did
say
was
very
*NL*
interesting
.
Her
dying
so
suddenly
''
-LRB-
slowly
,
and
with
hesitation
it
*NL*
was
spoken
-RRB-
,
``
and
you
--
none
of
you
being
at
home
--
and
your
father
,
I
*NL*
thought
--
perhaps
had
not
been
very
fond
of
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
from
these
circumstances
,
''
he
replied
-LRB-
his
quick
eye
*NL*
fixed
on
hers
-RRB-
,
``
you
infer
perhaps
the
probability
of
some
*NL*
negligence
--
some
''
--
-LRB-
involuntarily
she
shook
her
head
-RRB-
--
``
or
it
may
be
--
of
*NL*
something
still
less
pardonable
.
''
She
raised
her
eyes
towards
him
*NL*
more
fully
than
she
had
ever
done
before
.
``
My
mother
's
illness
,
''
he
*NL*
continued
,
``
the
seizure
which
ended
in
her
death
,
was
sudden
.
The
malady
*NL*
itself
,
one
from
which
she
had
often
suffered
,
a
bilious
fever
--
its
*NL*
cause
therefore
constitutional
.
On
the
third
day
,
in
short
,
as
soon
as
*NL*
she
could
be
prevailed
on
,
a
physician
attended
her
,
a
very
respectable
*NL*
man
,
and
one
in
whom
she
had
always
placed
great
confidence
.
Upon
his
*NL*
opinion
of
her
danger
,
two
others
were
called
in
the
next
day
,
and
*NL*
remained
in
almost
constant
attendance
for
four
and
twenty
hours
.
On
the
*NL*
fifth
day
she
died
.
During
the
progress
of
her
disorder
,
Frederick
and
I
*NL*
-LRB-
we
were
both
at
home
-RRB-
saw
her
repeatedly
;
and
from
our
own
observation
*NL*
can
bear
witness
to
her
having
received
every
possible
attention
*NL*
which
could
spring
from
the
affection
of
those
about
her
,
or
which
her
*NL*
situation
in
life
could
command
.
Poor
Eleanor
was
absent
,
and
at
such
a
*NL*
distance
as
to
return
only
to
see
her
mother
in
her
coffin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
your
father
,
''
said
Catherine
,
``
was
he
afflicted
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
a
time
,
greatly
so
.
You
have
erred
in
supposing
him
not
attached
*NL*
to
her
.
He
loved
her
,
I
am
persuaded
,
as
well
as
it
was
possible
for
him
*NL*
to
--
we
have
not
all
,
you
know
,
the
same

of
disposition

and
*NL*
I
will
not
pretend
to
say
that
while
she
lived
,
she
might
not
often
have
*NL*
had
much
to
bear
,
but
though
his
temper
injured
her
,
his
judgment
never
*NL*
did
.
His
value
of
her
was
sincere
;
and
,
if
not
permanently
,
he
was
truly
*NL*
afflicted
by
her
death
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
glad
of
it
,
''
said
Catherine
;
``
it
would
have
been
very
*NL*
shocking
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
understand
you
rightly
,
you
had
formed
a
surmise
of
such
horror
as
*NL*
I
have
hardly
words
to
--
Dear
Miss
Morland
,
consider
the
dreadful
nature
*NL*
of
the
suspicions
you
have
entertained
.
What
have
you
been
judging
from
?
*NL*
Remember
the
country
and
the
age
in
which
we
live
.
Remember
that
we
are
*NL*
English
,
that
we
are
Christians

Consult
your
own
understanding
,
your
*NL*
own
sense
of
the
probable
,
your
own
observation
of
what
is
passing
*NL*
around
you

Does
our
education
prepare
us
for
such
atrocities
?
Do
our
*NL*
laws
connive
at
them
?
Could
they
be
perpetrated
without
being
known
,
in
*NL*
a
country
like
this
,
where
social
and
literary
intercourse
is
on
such
a
*NL*
footing
,
where
every
man
is
surrounded
by
a
neighbourhood
of
voluntary
*NL*
spies
,
and
where
roads
and
newspapers
lay
everything
open
?
Dearest
Miss
*NL*
Morland
,
what
ideas
have
you
been
admitting
?

CHAPTER
25
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
visions
of
romance
were
over
.
Catherine
was
completely
awakened
.
*NL*
Henry
's
address
,
short
as
it
had
been
,
had
more
thoroughly
opened
her
*NL*
eyes
to
the
extravagance
of
her
late
fancies
than
all
their
several
*NL*
disappointments
had
done
.
Most
grievously
was
she
humbled
.
Most
bitterly
*NL*
did
she
cry
.
It
was
not
only
with
herself
that
she
was
sunk
--
but
with
*NL*
Henry
.
Her
folly
,
which
now
seemed
even
criminal
,
was
all
exposed
to
*NL*
him
,
and
he
must
despise
her
forever
.
The
liberty
which
her
imagination
*NL*
had
dared
to
take
with
the
character
of
his
father
--
could
he
ever
*NL*
forgive
it
?
The
absurdity
of
her
curiosity
and
her
fears
--
could
they
*NL*
ever
be
forgotten
?
She
hated
herself
more
than
she
could
express
.
He
*NL*
had
--
she
thought
he
had
,
once
or
twice
before
this
fatal
morning
,
shown
*NL*
something
like
affection
for
her
.
But
now
--
in
short
,
she
made
herself
as
*NL*
miserable
as
possible
for
about
half
an
hour
,
went
down
when
the
*NL*
clock
struck
five
,
with
a
broken
heart
,
and
could
scarcely
give
an
*NL*
intelligible
answer
to
Eleanor
's
inquiry
if
she
was
well
.
The
formidable
*NL*
Henry
soon
followed
her
into
the
room
,
and
the
only
difference
in
his
*NL*
behaviour
to
her
was
that
he
paid
her
rather
more
attention
than
usual
.
*NL*
Catherine
had
never
wanted
comfort
more
,
and
he
looked
as
if
he
was
*NL*
aware
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
evening
wore
away
with
no
abatement
of
this
soothing
politeness
;
and
*NL*
her
spirits
were
gradually
raised
to
a
modest
tranquillity
.
She
did
not
*NL*
learn
either
to
forget
or
defend
the
past
;
but
she
learned
to
hope
that
*NL*
it
would
never
transpire
farther
,
and
that
it
might
not
cost
her
Henry
's
*NL*
entire
regard
.
Her
thoughts
being
still
chiefly
fixed
on
what
she
had
*NL*
with
such
causeless
terror
felt
and
done
,
nothing
could
shortly
be
*NL*
clearer
than
that
it
had
been
all
a
voluntary
,
self-created
delusion
,
*NL*
each
trifling
circumstance
receiving
importance
from
an
imagination
*NL*
resolved
on
alarm
,
and
everything
forced
to
bend
to
one
purpose
by
*NL*
a
mind
which
,
before
she
entered
the
abbey
,
had
been
craving
to
be
*NL*
frightened
.
She
remembered
with
what
feelings
she
had
prepared
for
a
*NL*
knowledge
of
Northanger
.
She
saw
that
the
infatuation
had
been
created
,
*NL*
the
mischief
settled
,
long
before
her
quitting
Bath
,
and
it
seemed
as
if
*NL*
the
whole
might
be
traced
to
the
influence
of
that
sort
of
reading
which
*NL*
she
had
there
indulged
.
*NL*
*NL*
Charming
as
were
all
Mrs.
Radcliffe
's
works
,
and
charming
even
as
were
*NL*
the
works
of
all
her
imitators
,
it
was
not
in
them
perhaps
that
human
*NL*
nature
,
at
least
in
the
Midland
counties
of
England
,
was
to
be
looked
*NL*
for
.
Of
the
Alps
and
Pyrenees
,
with
their
pine
forests
and
their
vices
,
*NL*
they
might
give
a
faithful
delineation
;
and
Italy
,
Switzerland
,
and
*NL*
the
south
of
France
might
be
as
fruitful
in
horrors
as
they
were
there
*NL*
represented
.
Catherine
dared
not
doubt
beyond
her
own
country
,
and
even
*NL*
of
that
,
if
hard
pressed
,
would
have
yielded
the
northern
and
western
*NL*
extremities
.
But
in
the
central
part
of
England
there
was
surely
some
*NL*
security
for
the
existence
even
of
a
wife
not
beloved
,
in
the
laws
of
*NL*
the
land
,
and
the
manners
of
the
age
.
Murder
was
not
tolerated
,
servants
*NL*
were
not
slaves
,
and
neither
poison
nor
sleeping
potions
to
be
procured
,
*NL*
like
rhubarb
,
from
every
druggist
.
Among
the
Alps
and
Pyrenees
,
perhaps
,
*NL*
there
were
no
mixed
characters
.
There
,
such
as
were
not
as
spotless
as
*NL*
an
angel
might
have
the
dispositions
of
a
fiend
.
But
in
England
it
was
*NL*
not
so
;
among
the
English
,
she
believed
,
in
their
hearts
and
habits
,
*NL*
there
was
a
general
though
unequal
mixture
of
good
and
bad
.
Upon
this
*NL*
conviction
,
she
would
not
be
surprised
if
even
in
Henry
and
Eleanor
*NL*
Tilney
,
some
slight
imperfection
might
hereafter
appear
;
and
upon
this
*NL*
conviction
she
need
not
fear
to
acknowledge
some
actual
specks
in
*NL*
the
character
of
their
father
,
who
,
though
cleared
from
the
grossly
*NL*
injurious
suspicions
which
she
must
ever
blush
to
have
entertained
,
she
*NL*
did
believe
,
upon
serious
consideration
,
to
be
not
perfectly
amiable
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
mind
made
up
on
these
several
points
,
and
her
resolution
formed
,
of
*NL*
always
judging
and
acting
in
future
with
the
greatest
good
sense
,
she
*NL*
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
forgive
herself
and
be
happier
than
ever
;
and
*NL*
the
lenient
hand
of
time
did
much
for
her
by
insensible
gradations
in
*NL*
the
course
of
another
day
.
Henry
's
astonishing
generosity
and
nobleness
*NL*
of
conduct
,
in
never
alluding
in
the
slightest
way
to
what
had
passed
,
*NL*
was
of
the
greatest
assistance
to
her
;
and
sooner
than
she
could
have
*NL*
supposed
it
possible
in
the
beginning
of
her
distress
,
her
spirits
*NL*
became
absolutely
comfortable
,
and
capable
,
as
heretofore
,
of
continual
*NL*
improvement
by
anything
he
said
.
There
were
still
some
subjects
,
indeed
,
*NL*
under
which
she
believed
they
must
always
tremble
--
the
mention
of
a
*NL*
chest
or
a
cabinet
,
for
instance
--
and
she
did
not
love
the
sight
of
*NL*
japan
in
any
shape
:
but
even
she
could
allow
that
an
occasional
memento
*NL*
of
past
folly
,
however
painful
,
might
not
be
without
use
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
anxieties
of
common
life
began
soon
to
succeed
to
the
alarms
of
*NL*
romance
.
Her
desire
of
hearing
from
Isabella
grew
every
day
greater
.
*NL*
She
was
quite
impatient
to
know
how
the
Bath
world
went
on
,
and
how
the
*NL*
rooms
were
attended
;
and
especially
was
she
anxious
to
be
assured
of
*NL*
Isabella
's
having
matched
some
fine
netting-cotton
,
on
which
she
had
*NL*
left
her
intent
;
and
of
her
continuing
on
the
best
terms
with
James
.
Her
*NL*
only
dependence
for
information
of
any
kind
was
on
Isabella
.
James
had
*NL*
protested
against
writing
to
her
till
his
return
to
Oxford
;
and
Mrs.
*NL*
Allen
had
given
her
no
hopes
of
a
letter
till
she
had
got
back
to
*NL*
Fullerton
.
But
Isabella
had
promised
and
promised
again
;
and
when
she
*NL*
promised
a
thing
,
she
was
so
scrupulous
in
performing
it
!
This
made
it
*NL*
so
particularly
strange
!
*NL*
*NL*
For
nine
successive
mornings
,
Catherine
wondered
over
the
repetition
*NL*
of
a
disappointment
,
which
each
morning
became
more
severe
:
but
,
on
*NL*
the
tenth
,
when
she
entered
the
breakfast-room
,
her
first
object
was
a
*NL*
letter
,
held
out
by
Henry
's
willing
hand
.
She
thanked
him
as
heartily
*NL*
as
if
he
had
written
it
himself
.
''
'T
is
only
from
James
,
however
,
''
as
she
*NL*
looked
at
the
direction
.
She
opened
it
;
it
was
from
Oxford
;
and
to
this
*NL*
purpose
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
Catherine
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
Though
,
God
knows
,
with
little
inclination
for
writing
,
I
think
it
my
*NL*
duty
to
tell
you
that
everything
is
at
an
end
between
Miss
Thorpe
and
*NL*
me
.
I
left
her
and
Bath
yesterday
,
never
to
see
either
again
.
I
shall
*NL*
not
enter
into
particulars
--
they
would
only
pain
you
more
.
You
will
soon
*NL*
hear
enough
from
another
quarter
to
know
where
lies
the
blame
;
and
I
*NL*
hope
will
acquit
your
brother
of
everything
but
the
folly
of
too
easily
*NL*
thinking
his
affection
returned
.
Thank
God
!
I
am
undeceived
in
time
!
*NL*
But
it
is
a
heavy
blow
!
After
my
father
's
consent
had
been
so
kindly
*NL*
given
--
but
no
more
of
this
.
She
has
made
me
miserable
forever
!
Let
me
*NL*
soon
hear
from
you
,
dear
Catherine
;
you
are
my
only
friend
;
your
love
*NL*
I
do
build
upon
.
I
wish
your
visit
at
Northanger
may
be
over
before
*NL*
Captain
Tilney
makes
his
engagement
known
,
or
you
will
be
uncomfortably
*NL*
circumstanced
.
Poor
Thorpe
is
in
town
:
I
dread
the
sight
of
him
;
his
*NL*
honest
heart
would
feel
so
much
.
I
have
written
to
him
and
my
father
.
*NL*
Her
duplicity
hurts
me
more
than
all
;
till
the
very
last
,
if
I
reasoned
*NL*
with
her
,
she
declared
herself
as
much
attached
to
me
as
ever
,
and
*NL*
laughed
at
my
fears
.
I
am
ashamed
to
think
how
long
I
bore
with
it
;
*NL*
but
if
ever
man
had
reason
to
believe
himself
loved
,
I
was
that
man
.
I
*NL*
can
not
understand
even
now
what
she
would
be
at
,
for
there
could
be
no
*NL*
need
of
my
being
played
off
to
make
her
secure
of
Tilney
.
We
parted
*NL*
at
last
by
mutual
consent
--
happy
for
me
had
we
never
met
!
I
can
never
*NL*
expect
to
know
such
another
woman
!
Dearest
Catherine
,
beware
how
you
*NL*
give
your
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Believe
me
,
''
&
c.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Catherine
had
not
read
three
lines
before
her
sudden
change
of
*NL*
countenance
,
and
short
exclamations
of
sorrowing
wonder
,
declared
her
to
*NL*
be
receiving
unpleasant
news
;
and
Henry
,
earnestly
watching
her
through
*NL*
the
whole
letter
,
saw
plainly
that
it
ended
no
better
than
it
began
.
He
*NL*
was
prevented
,
however
,
from
even
looking
his
surprise
by
his
father
's
*NL*
entrance
.
They
went
to
breakfast
directly
;
but
Catherine
could
hardly
*NL*
eat
anything
.
Tears
filled
her
eyes
,
and
even
ran
down
her
cheeks
as
she
*NL*
sat
.
The
letter
was
one
moment
in
her
hand
,
then
in
her
lap
,
and
then
in
*NL*
her
pocket
;
and
she
looked
as
if
she
knew
not
what
she
did
.
The
general
,
*NL*
between
his
cocoa
and
his
newspaper
,
had
luckily
no
leisure
for
noticing
*NL*
her
;
but
to
the
other
two
her
distress
was
equally
visible
.
As
soon
*NL*
as
she
dared
leave
the
table
she
hurried
away
to
her
own
room
;
but
the
*NL*
housemaids
were
busy
in
it
,
and
she
was
obliged
to
come
down
again
.
*NL*
She
turned
into
the
drawing-room
for
privacy
,
but
Henry
and
Eleanor
had
*NL*
likewise
retreated
thither
,
and
were
at
that
moment
deep
in
consultation
*NL*
about
her
.
She
drew
back
,
trying
to
beg
their
pardon
,
but
was
,
with
*NL*
gentle
violence
,
forced
to
return
;
and
the
others
withdrew
,
after
*NL*
Eleanor
had
affectionately
expressed
a
wish
of
being
of
use
or
comfort
*NL*
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
half
an
hour
's
free
indulgence
of
grief
and
reflection
,
Catherine
*NL*
felt
equal
to
encountering
her
friends
;
but
whether
she
should
make
*NL*
her
distress
known
to
them
was
another
consideration
.
Perhaps
,
if
*NL*
particularly
questioned
,
she
might
just
give
an
idea
--
just
distantly
*NL*
hint
at
it
--
but
not
more
.
To
expose
a
friend
,
such
a
friend
as
Isabella
*NL*
had
been
to
her
--
and
then
their
own
brother
so
closely
concerned
in
it
!
*NL*
She
believed
she
must
waive
the
subject
altogether
.
Henry
and
Eleanor
*NL*
were
by
themselves
in
the
breakfast-room
;
and
each
,
as
she
entered
it
,
*NL*
looked
at
her
anxiously
.
Catherine
took
her
place
at
the
table
,
and
,
*NL*
after
a
short
silence
,
Eleanor
said
,
``
No
bad
news
from
Fullerton
,
I
*NL*
hope
?
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Morland
--
your
brothers
and
sisters
--
I
hope
they
are
*NL*
none
of
them
ill
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
thank
you
''
-LRB-
sighing
as
she
spoke
-RRB-
;
``
they
are
all
very
well
.
My
*NL*
letter
was
from
my
brother
at
Oxford
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
further
was
said
for
a
few
minutes
;
and
then
speaking
through
*NL*
her
tears
,
she
added
,
``
I
do
not
think
I
shall
ever
wish
for
a
letter
*NL*
again
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sorry
,
''
said
Henry
,
closing
the
book
he
had
just
opened
;
``
if
I
*NL*
had
suspected
the
letter
of
containing
anything
unwelcome
,
I
should
have
*NL*
given
it
with
very
different
feelings
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
contained
something
worse
than
anybody
could
suppose
!
Poor
James
is
*NL*
so
unhappy
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
To
have
so
kind-hearted

so
affectionate
a

replied
Henry
*NL*
warmly
,
``
must
be
a
comfort

him

any
distress

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
one
favour
to
beg

said
Catherine
,
shortly
afterwards
,
in
an
*NL*
agitated
manner
,
``
that

your
brother

be
coming
here

give

notice
of

Yes

I
am
sure
I
should
be
very
sorry

leave
you
so
soon

*NL*
something
has
happened
that
would
make
it
very
dreadful
for
me
to
be
in

the
same
house
with
Captain
Tilney

*NL*
*NL*
Eleanor
's
work
was
suspended
while
she
gazed
with
increasing
*NL*
astonishment
;
but
Henry
began
to
suspect
the
truth
,
and
something
,
in
*NL*
which
Miss
Thorpe
's
name
was
included
,
passed
his
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
quick
you
are
!
''
cried
Catherine
:
``
you
have
guessed
it
,
I
declare
!
*NL*
And
yet
,
when
we
talked
about
it
in
Bath
,
you
little
thought
of
its
*NL*
ending
so

Isabella
--
no
wonder
now
I
have
not
heard
from
her
--
Isabella
*NL*
has
deserted
my
brother
,
and
is
to
marry
yours
!
Could
you
have
believed
*NL*
there
had
been
such
inconstancy
and
fickleness
,
and
everything
that
is
*NL*
bad
in
the
world
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
,
so
far
as
concerns
my
brother

you
are
misinformed

I
hope

he
has
not
had
any
material
share
in
bringing
on
Mr.
Morland
's
*NL*
disappointment

His
marrying
Miss
Thorpe
is
not
probable

I
think
you

must
be
deceived
so
far

I
am
very
sorry
for
Mr.
Morland

sorry
that
*NL*
anyone
you
love
should
be
unhappy
;
but
my
surprise
would
be
greater
at

Frederick

marrying
her

at
any
other
part
of
the
story

*NL*
*NL*
``

one
part

recollecting
with
a
blush
the
last

*NL*
``
No

cried
Catherine

were

clearer

Frederick

*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Tilney
,
at
Catherine
's
invitation
,
now
read
the
letter
likewise
,
*NL*
and
,
having
expressed
also
her
concern
and
surprise
,
began
to
inquire
*NL*
into
Miss
Thorpe
's
connections
and
fortune
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Her
mother
is
a
very
good

was
Catherine
's
answer

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
was
her
father

*NL*
*NL*
``
A

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

any
fortune

all

*NL*
that
will
not
signify
in
your
family

Your
father
is
so
very
liberal
!
*NL*
He
told
me
the
other
day
that
he
only
valued
money
as
it
allowed
him
to
*NL*
promote
the
happiness
of
his
children
.
''
The
brother
and
sister
looked
*NL*
at
each
other
.
``
But
,
''
said
Eleanor
,
after
a
short
pause
,
``
would
it
be
to
*NL*
promote
his
happiness

to
enable
him
to
marry
such
a
girl
?
She
must
be
*NL*
an
unprincipled
one
,
or
she
could
not
have
used
your
brother
so
.
And
how
*NL*
strange
an
infatuation
on
Frederick
's
side
!
A
girl
who
,
before
his
eyes
,
*NL*
is
violating
an
engagement
voluntarily
entered
into
with
another
man
!
Is
*NL*
not
it
inconceivable

Henry

Frederick
too
,
who
always
wore
his
heart
so
*NL*
proudly
!
Who
found
no
woman
good
enough
to
be
loved
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
the
most
unpromising
circumstance

the
strongest
presumption
*NL*
against
him

When
I
think
of
his
past
declarations
,
I
give
him
up
.
*NL*
Moreover
,
I
have
too
good
an
opinion
of
Miss
Thorpe
's
prudence
to
*NL*
suppose
that
she
would
part
with
one
gentleman
before
the
other
*NL*
was
secured

It
is
all
over
with
Frederick
indeed
!
He
is
a
deceased
*NL*
man

defunct
in
understanding

Prepare
for
your
sister-in-law

Eleanor

*NL*
and
such
a
sister-in-law
as
you
must
delight
in
!
Open

candid

artless

*NL*
guileless
,
with
affections
strong

simple

forming
no
pretensions

knowing
no

*NL*
*NL*
``
Such
a
sister-in-law

Henry

should
delight
in

said
Eleanor
with
a
*NL*
smile

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
perhaps

observed
Catherine
,
``
though
she
has
behaved
so
ill
by
our

family

she
may
behave
better
by
yours

really
got
the
man

may
be
constant

*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
I
am
afraid

Henry

I

very
constant

Frederick

``
You

ambition

then

And
,
upon
my
word

there
are

some
things
that
seem
very
like
it

I
can
not
forget
that
,
when
she
first

knew
what
my
father
would
do
for
them

she
seemed
quite
disappointed

never

deceived

*NL*
``
My

disappointment

loss

I

Catherine
,
by
some

found

very

relieved

CHAPTER
26
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
From
this
time
,
the
subject
was
frequently
canvassed
by
the
three
young
*NL*
people
;
and
Catherine
found
,
with
some
surprise
,
that
her
two
young
*NL*
friends
were
perfectly
agreed
in
considering
Isabella
's
want
of
*NL*
consequence
and
fortune
as
likely
to
throw
great
difficulties
in
the
way
*NL*
of
her
marrying
their
brother
.
Their
persuasion
that
the
general
would
,
*NL*
upon
this
ground
alone
,
independent
of
the
objection
that
might
be
*NL*
raised
against
her
character
,
oppose
the
connection
,
turned
her
feelings
*NL*
moreover
with
some
alarm
towards
herself
.
She
was
as
insignificant
,
*NL*
and
perhaps
as
portionless
,
as
Isabella
;
and
if
the
heir
of
the
Tilney
*NL*
property
had
not
grandeur
and
wealth
enough
in
himself
,
at
what
point
*NL*
of
interest
were
the
demands
of
his
younger
brother
to
rest
?
The
very
*NL*
painful
reflections
to
which
this
thought
led
could
only
be
dispersed
by
*NL*
a
dependence
on
the
effect
of
that
particular
partiality
,
which
,
as
she
*NL*
was
given
to
understand
by
his
words
as
well
as
his
actions
,
she
had
*NL*
from
the
first
been
so
fortunate
as
to
excite
in
the
general
;
and
by
a
*NL*
recollection
of
some
most
generous
and
disinterested
sentiments
on
the
*NL*
subject
of
money
,
which
she
had
more
than
once
heard
him
utter
,
and
*NL*
which
tempted
her
to
think
his
disposition
in
such
matters
misunderstood
*NL*
by
his
children
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
so
fully
convinced
,
however
,
that
their
brother
would
not
*NL*
have
the
courage
to
apply
in
person
for
his
father
's
consent
,
and
so
*NL*
repeatedly
assured
her
that
he
had
never
in
his
life
been
less
likely
to
*NL*
come
to
Northanger
than
at
the
present
time
,
that
she
suffered
her
mind
*NL*
to
be
at
ease
as
to
the
necessity
of
any
sudden
removal
of
her
own
.
But
*NL*
as
it
was
not
to
be
supposed
that
Captain
Tilney
,
whenever
he
made
his
*NL*
application
,
would
give
his
father
any
just
idea
of
Isabella
's
conduct
,
*NL*
it
occurred
to
her
as
highly
expedient
that
Henry
should
lay
the
whole
*NL*
business
before
him
as
it
really
was
,
enabling
the
general
by
that
means
*NL*
to
form
a
cool
and
impartial
opinion
,
and
prepare
his
objections
on
*NL*
a
fairer
ground
than
inequality
of
situations
.
She
proposed
it
to
him
*NL*
accordingly
;
but
he
did
not
catch
at
the
measure
so
eagerly
as
she
had
*NL*
expected
.
``
No
,
''
said
he
,
``
my
father
's
hands
need
not
be
strengthened
,
*NL*
and
Frederick
's
confession
of
folly
need
not
be
forestalled
.
He
must
*NL*
tell
his
own
story
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
he
will
tell
only
half
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
quarter
would
be
enough
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
day
or
two
passed
away
and
brought
no
tidings
of
Captain
Tilney
.
His
*NL*
brother
and
sister
knew
not
what
to
think
.
Sometimes
it
appeared
to
*NL*
them
as
if
his
silence
would
be
the
natural
result
of
the
suspected
*NL*
engagement
,
and
at
others
that
it
was
wholly
incompatible
with
it
.
*NL*
The
general
,
meanwhile
,
though
offended
every
morning
by
Frederick
's
*NL*
remissness
in
writing
,
was
free
from
any
real
anxiety
about
him
,
and
had
*NL*
no
more
pressing
solicitude
than
that
of
making
Miss
Morland
's
time
at
*NL*
Northanger
pass
pleasantly
.
He
often
expressed
his
uneasiness
on
this
*NL*
head
,
feared
the
sameness
of
every
day
's
society
and
employments
would
*NL*
disgust
her
with
the
place
,
wished
the
Lady
Frasers
had
been
in
the
*NL*
country
,
talked
every
now
and
then
of
having
a
large
party
to
dinner
,
*NL*
and
once
or
twice
began
even
to
calculate
the
number
of
young
dancing
*NL*
people
in
the
neighbourhood
.
But
then
it
was
such
a
dead
time
of
year
,
*NL*
no
wild-fowl
,
no
game
,
and
the
Lady
Frasers
were
not
in
the
country
.
*NL*
And
it
all
ended
,
at
last
,
in
his
telling
Henry
one
morning
that
when
he
*NL*
next
went
to
Woodston
,
they
would
take
him
by
surprise
there
some
day
*NL*
or
other
,
and
eat
their
mutton
with
him
.
Henry
was
greatly
honoured
and
*NL*
very
happy
,
and
Catherine
was
quite
delighted
with
the
scheme
.
``
And
when
*NL*
do
you
think
,
sir
,
I
may
look
forward
to
this
pleasure
?
I
must
be
at
*NL*
Woodston
on
Monday
to
attend
the
parish
meeting
,
and
shall
probably
be
*NL*
obliged
to
stay
two
or
three
days
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
well
,
we
will
take
our
chance
some
one
of
those
days
.
There
is
*NL*
no
need
to
fix
.
You
are
not
to
put
yourself
at
all
out
of
your
way
.
*NL*
Whatever
you
may
happen
to
have
in
the
house
will
be
enough

I
think
I
*NL*
can
answer
for
the
young
ladies
making
allowance
for
a
bachelor
's
table
.
*NL*
Let
me
see
;
Monday
will
be
a
busy
day
with
you
,
we
will
not
come
on
*NL*
Monday
;
and
Tuesday
will
be
a
busy
one
with
me
.
I
expect
my
surveyor
*NL*
from
Brockham
with
his
report
in
the
morning
;
and
afterwards
I
can
not
in
*NL*
decency
fail
attending
the
club
.
I
really
could
not
face
my
acquaintance
*NL*
if
I
stayed
away
now
;
for
,
as
I
am
known
to
be
in
the
country
,
it
would
*NL*
be
taken
exceedingly
amiss
;
and
it
is
a
rule
with
me
,
Miss
Morland
,
*NL*
never
to
give
offence
to
any
of
my
neighbours
,
if
a
small
sacrifice
of
*NL*
time
and
attention
can
prevent
it

are
a
set
of
very
worthy
men
.
*NL*
They
have
half
a
buck
from
Northanger
twice
a
year
;
and
I
dine
with
them
*NL*
whenever
I
can
.
Tuesday
,
therefore
,
we
may
say
is
out
of
the
question
.
*NL*
But
on
Wednesday
,
I
think
,
Henry
,
you
may
expect
us
;
and
we
shall
be
*NL*
with
you
early
,
that
we
may
have
time
to
look
about
us
.
Two
hours
and
*NL*
three
quarters
will
carry
us
to
Woodston
,
I
suppose
;
we
shall
be
in
the
*NL*
carriage
by
ten
;
so
,
about
a
quarter
before
one
on
Wednesday
,
you
may
*NL*
look
for
us
.

A
ball
itself
could
not
have
been
more
welcome
to
Catherine
than
*NL*
this
little
excursion
,
so
strong
was
her
desire
to
be
acquainted
with
*NL*
Woodston
;
and
her
heart
was
still
bounding
with
joy
when
Henry
,
about
an
*NL*
hour
afterwards
,
came
booted
and
greatcoated
into
the
room
where
she
*NL*
and
Eleanor
were
sitting
,
and
said
,
``
I
am
come
,
young
ladies
,
in
a
*NL*
very
moralizing
strain
,
to
observe
that
our
pleasures
in
this
world
*NL*
are
always
to
be
paid
for
,
and
that
we
often
purchase
them
at
a
great
*NL*
disadvantage
,
giving
ready-monied
actual
happiness
for
a
draft
on
the
*NL*
future
,
that
may
not
be
honoured
.
Witness
myself
,
at
this
present
hour
.
*NL*
Because
I
am
to
hope
for
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
you
at
Woodston
on
*NL*
Wednesday
,
which
bad
weather
,
or
twenty
other
causes
,
may
prevent
,
I
*NL*
must
go
away
directly
,
two
days
before
I
intended
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
away
!
''
said
Catherine
,
with
a
very
long
face
.
``
And
why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
!
How
can
you
ask
the
question
?
Because
no
time
is
to
be
lost
in
*NL*
frightening
my
old
housekeeper
out
of
her
wits
,
because
I
must
go
and
*NL*
prepare
a
dinner
for
you
,
to
be
sure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
Not
seriously
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
,
and
sadly
too
--
for
I
had
much
rather
stay
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
how
can
you
think
of
such
a
thing
,
after
what
the
general
said
?
*NL*
When
he
so
particularly
desired
you
not
to
give
yourself
any
trouble
,
*NL*
because
anything
would
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Henry
only
smiled
.
``
I
am
sure
it
is
quite
unnecessary
upon
your
sister
's
*NL*
account
and
mine
.
You
must
know
it
to
be
so
;
and
the
general
made
such
*NL*
a
point
of
your
providing
nothing
extraordinary
:
besides
,
if
he
had
not
*NL*
said
half
so
much
as
he
did
,
he
has
always
such
an
excellent
dinner
*NL*
at
home
,
that
sitting
down
to
a
middling
one
for
one
day
could
not
*NL*
signify
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
I
could
reason
like
you
,
for
his
sake
and
my
own
.
Good-bye
.
As
*NL*
tomorrow
is
Sunday
,
Eleanor
,
I
shall
not
return
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
;
and
,
it
being
at
any
time
a
much
simpler
operation
to
Catherine
*NL*
to
doubt
her
own
judgment
than
Henry
's
,
she
was
very
soon
obliged
to
*NL*
give
him
credit
for
being
right
,
however
disagreeable
to
her
his
going
.
*NL*
But
the
inexplicability
of
the
general
's
conduct
dwelt
much
on
her
*NL*
thoughts
.
That
he
was
very
particular
in
his
eating
,
she
had
,
by
her
own
*NL*
unassisted
observation
,
already
discovered
;
but
why
he
should
say
*NL*
one
thing
so
positively
,
and
mean
another
all
the
while
,
was
most
*NL*
unaccountable
!
How
were
people
,
at
that
rate
,
to
be
understood
?
Who
but
*NL*
Henry
could
have
been
aware
of
what
his
father
was
at
?
*NL*
*NL*
From
Saturday
to
Wednesday
,
however
,
they
were
now
to
be
without
Henry
.
*NL*
This
was
the
sad
finale
of
every
reflection
:
and
Captain
Tilney
's
letter
*NL*
would
certainly
come
in
his
absence
;
and
Wednesday
she
was
very
sure
*NL*
would
be
wet
.
The
past
,
present
,
and
future
were
all
equally
in
gloom
.
*NL*
Her
brother
so
unhappy
,
and
her
loss
in
Isabella
so
great
;
and
Eleanor
's
*NL*
spirits
always
affected
by
Henry
's
absence
!
What
was
there
to
interest
*NL*
or
amuse
her
?
She
was
tired
of
the
woods
and
the
shrubberies
--
always
so
*NL*
smooth
and
so
dry
;
and
the
abbey
in
itself
was
no
more
to
her
now
than
*NL*
any
other
house
.
The
painful
remembrance
of
the
folly
it
had
helped
*NL*
to
nourish
and
perfect
was
the
only
emotion
which
could
spring
from
a
*NL*
consideration
of
the
building
.
What
a
revolution
in
her
ideas
!
She
,
who
*NL*
had
so
longed
to
be
in
an
abbey
!
Now
,
there
was
nothing
so
charming
*NL*
to
her
imagination
as
the
unpretending
comfort
of
a
well-connected
*NL*
parsonage
,
something
like
Fullerton
,
but
better
:
Fullerton
had
its
*NL*
faults
,
but
Woodston
probably
had
none
.
If
Wednesday
should
ever
come
!
*NL*
*NL*
It
did
come
,
and
exactly
when
it
might
be
reasonably
looked
for
.
It
*NL*
came
--
it
was
fine
--
and
Catherine
trod
on
air
.
By
ten
o'clock
,
the
chaise
*NL*
and
four
conveyed
the
trio
from
the
abbey
;
and
,
after
an
agreeable
drive
*NL*
of
almost
twenty
miles
,
they
entered
Woodston
,
a
large
and
populous
*NL*
village
,
in
a
situation
not
unpleasant
.
Catherine
was
ashamed
to
say
*NL*
how
pretty
she
thought
it
,
as
the
general
seemed
to
think
an
apology
*NL*
necessary
for
the
flatness
of
the
country
,
and
the
size
of
the
village
;
*NL*
but
in
her
heart
she
preferred
it
to
any
place
she
had
ever
been
at
,
*NL*
and
looked
with
great
admiration
at
every
neat
house
above
the
rank
of
*NL*
a
cottage
,
and
at
all
the
little
chandler
's
shops
which
they
passed
.
At
*NL*
the
further
end
of
the
village
,
and
tolerably
disengaged
from
the
rest
*NL*
of
it
,
stood
the
parsonage
,
a
new-built
substantial
stone
house
,
with
*NL*
its
semicircular
sweep
and
green
gates
;
and
,
as
they
drove
up
to
the
*NL*
door
,
Henry
,
with
the
friends
of
his
solitude
,
a
large
Newfoundland
*NL*
puppy
and
two
or
three
terriers
,
was
ready
to
receive
and
make
much
of
*NL*
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Catherine
's
mind
was
too
full
,
as
she
entered
the
house
,
for
her
either
*NL*
to
observe
or
to
say
a
great
deal
;
and
,
till
called
on
by
the
general
*NL*
for
her
opinion
of
it
,
she
had
very
little
idea
of
the
room
in
which
she
*NL*
was
sitting
.
Upon
looking
round
it
then
,
she
perceived
in
a
moment
that
*NL*
it
was
the
most
comfortable
room
in
the
world
;
but
she
was
too
guarded
*NL*
to
say
so
,
and
the
coldness
of
her
praise
disappointed
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
not
calling
it
a
good
house
,
''
said
he
.
``
We
are
not
comparing
*NL*
it
with
Fullerton
and
Northanger
--
we
are
considering
it
as
a
mere
*NL*
parsonage
,
small
and
confined
,
we
allow
,
but
decent
,
perhaps
,
and
*NL*
habitable
;
and
altogether
not
inferior
to
the
generality
;
or
,
in
other
*NL*
words
,
I
believe
there
are
few
country
parsonages
in
England
half
so
*NL*
good
.
It
may
admit
of
improvement
,
however
.
Far
be
it
from
me
to
say
*NL*
otherwise
;
and
anything
in
reason
--
a
bow
thrown
out
,
perhaps
--
though
,
*NL*
between
ourselves
,
if
there
is
one
thing
more
than
another
my
aversion
,
*NL*
it
is
a
patched-on
bow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Catherine
did
not
hear
enough
of
this
speech
to
understand
or
be
pained
*NL*
by
it
;
and
other
subjects
being
studiously
brought
forward
and
supported
*NL*
by
Henry
,
at
the
same
time
that
a
tray
full
of
refreshments
was
*NL*
introduced
by
his
servant
,
the
general
was
shortly
restored
to
his
*NL*
complacency
,
and
Catherine
to
all
her
usual
ease
of
spirits
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
room
in
question
was
of
a
commodious
,
well-proportioned
size
,
and
*NL*
handsomely
fitted
up
as
a
dining-parlour
;
and
on
their
quitting
it
to
*NL*
walk
round
the
grounds
,
she
was
shown
,
first
into
a
smaller
apartment
,
*NL*
belonging
peculiarly
to
the
master
of
the
house
,
and
made
unusually
tidy
*NL*
on
the
occasion
;
and
afterwards
into
what
was
to
be
the
drawing-room
,
*NL*
with
the
appearance
of
which
,
though
unfurnished
,
Catherine
was
*NL*
delighted
enough
even
to
satisfy
the
general
.
It
was
a
prettily
shaped
*NL*
room
,
the
windows
reaching
to
the
ground
,
and
the
view
from
them
*NL*
pleasant
,
though
only
over
green
meadows
;
and
she
expressed
her
*NL*
admiration
at
the
moment
with
all
the
honest
simplicity
with
which
she
*NL*
felt
it
.
``
Oh
!
Why
do
not
you
fit
up
this
room
,
Mr.
Tilney
?
What
a
pity
*NL*
not
to
have
it
fitted
up
!
It
is
the
prettiest
room
I
ever
saw
;
it
is
the
*NL*
prettiest
room
in
the
world
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
trust
,
''
said
the
general
,
with
a
most
satisfied
smile
,
``
that
it
will
*NL*
very
speedily
be
furnished
:
it
waits
only
for
a
lady
's
taste
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
if
it
was
my
house
,
I
should
never
sit
anywhere
else
.
Oh
!
What
a
*NL*
sweet
little
cottage
there
is
among
the
trees
--
apple
trees
,
too
!
It
is
*NL*
the
prettiest
cottage
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
like
it
--
you
approve
it
as
an
object
--
it
is
enough
.
Henry
,
remember
*NL*
that
Robinson
is
spoken
to
about
it
.
The
cottage
remains
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Such
a
compliment
recalled
all
Catherine
's
consciousness
,
and
silenced
*NL*
her
directly
;
and
,
though
pointedly
applied
to
by
the
general
for
her
*NL*
choice
of
the
prevailing
colour
of
the
paper
and
hangings
,
nothing
like
*NL*
an
opinion
on
the
subject
could
be
drawn
from
her
.
The
influence
of
*NL*
fresh
objects
and
fresh
air
,
however
,
was
of
great
use
in
dissipating
*NL*
these
embarrassing
associations
;
and
,
having
reached
the
ornamental
part
*NL*
of
the
premises
,
consisting
of
a
walk
round
two
sides
of
a
meadow
,
on
*NL*
which
Henry
's
genius
had
begun
to
act
about
half
a
year
ago
,
she
was
*NL*
sufficiently
recovered
to
think
it
prettier
than
any
pleasure-ground
she
*NL*
had
ever
been
in
before
,
though
there
was
not
a
shrub
in
it
higher
than
*NL*
the
green
bench
in
the
corner
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
saunter
into
other
meadows
,
and
through
part
of
the
village
,
with
a
*NL*
visit
to
the
stables
to
examine
some
improvements
,
and
a
charming
game
*NL*
of
play
with
a
litter
of
puppies
just
able
to
roll
about
,
brought
them
*NL*
to
four
o'clock
,
when
Catherine
scarcely
thought
it
could
be
three
.
At
*NL*
four
they
were
to
dine
,
and
at
six
to
set
off
on
their
return
.
Never
had
*NL*
any
day
passed
so
quickly
!
*NL*
*NL*
She
could
not
but
observe
that
the
abundance
of
the
dinner
did
not
seem
*NL*
to
create
the
smallest
astonishment
in
the
general
;
nay
,
that
he
was
*NL*
even
looking
at
the
side-table
for
cold
meat
which
was
not
there
.
His
*NL*
son
and
daughter
's
observations
were
of
a
different
kind
.
They
had
*NL*
seldom
seen
him
eat
so
heartily
at
any
table
but
his
own
,
and
never
*NL*
before
known
him
so
little
disconcerted
by
the
melted
butter
's
being
*NL*
oiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
six
o'clock
,
the
general
having
taken
his
coffee
,
the
carriage
again
*NL*
received
them
;
and
so
gratifying
had
been
the
tenor
of
his
conduct
*NL*
throughout
the
whole
visit
,
so
well
assured
was
her
mind
on
the
subject
*NL*
of
his
expectations
,
that
,
could
she
have
felt
equally
confident
of
the
*NL*
wishes
of
his
son
,
Catherine
would
have
quitted
Woodston
with
little
*NL*
anxiety
as
to
the
How
or
the
When
she
might
return
to
it
.

CHAPTER
27
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
morning
brought
the
following
very
unexpected
letter
from
*NL*
Isabella
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Bath
,
April
*NL*
*NL*
My
dearest
Catherine
,
I
received
your
two
kind
letters
with
the
greatest
*NL*
delight
,
and
have
a
thousand
apologies
to
make
for
not
answering
them
*NL*
sooner
.
I
really
am
quite
ashamed
of
my
idleness
;
but
in
this
horrid
*NL*
place
one
can
find
time
for
nothing
.
I
have
had
my
pen
in
my
hand
to
*NL*
begin
a
letter
to
you
almost
every
day
since
you
left
Bath
,
but
have
*NL*
always
been
prevented
by
some
silly
trifler
or
other
.
Pray
write
to
me
*NL*
soon
,
and
direct
to
my
own
home
.
Thank
God
,
we
leave
this
vile
place
*NL*
tomorrow
.
Since
you
went
away
,
I
have
had
no
pleasure
in
it
--
the
dust
*NL*
is
beyond
anything
;
and
everybody
one
cares
for
is
gone
.
I
believe
if
I
*NL*
could
see
you
I
should
not
mind
the
rest
,
for
you
are
dearer
to
me
than
*NL*
anybody
can
conceive
.
I
am
quite
uneasy
about
your
dear
brother
,
not
*NL*
having
heard
from
him
since
he
went
to
Oxford
;
and
am
fearful
of
some
*NL*
misunderstanding
.
Your
kind
offices
will
set
all
right
:
he
is
the
only
*NL*
man
I
ever
did
or
could
love
,
and
I
trust
you
will
convince
him
of
it
.
*NL*
The
spring
fashions
are
partly
down
;
and
the
hats
the
most
frightful
you
*NL*
can
imagine
.
I
hope
you
spend
your
time
pleasantly
,
but
am
afraid
you
*NL*
never
think
of
me
.
I
will
not
say
all
that
I
could
of
the
family
you
are
*NL*
with
,
because
I
would
not
be
ungenerous
,
or
set
you
against
those
you
*NL*
esteem
;
but
it
is
very
difficult
to
know
whom
to
trust
,
and
young
men
*NL*
never
know
their
minds
two
days
together
.
I
rejoice
to
say
that
the
*NL*
young
man
whom
,
of
all
others
,
I
particularly
abhor
,
has
left
Bath
.
You
*NL*
will
know
,
from
this
description
,
I
must
mean
Captain
Tilney
,
who
,
as
*NL*
you
may
remember
,
was
amazingly
disposed
to
follow
and
tease
me
,
before
*NL*
you
went
away
.
Afterwards
he
got
worse
,
and
became
quite
my
shadow
.
Many
*NL*
girls
might
have
been
taken
in
,
for
never
were
such
attentions
;
but
I
*NL*
knew
the
fickle
sex
too
well
.
He
went
away
to
his
regiment
two
days
ago
,
*NL*
and
I
trust
I
shall
never
be
plagued
with
him
again
.
He
is
the
greatest
*NL*
coxcomb
I
ever
saw
,
and
amazingly
disagreeable
.
The
last
two
days
he
was
*NL*
always
by
the
side
of
Charlotte
Davis
:
I
pitied
his
taste
,
but
took
no
*NL*
notice
of
him
.
The
last
time
we
met
was
in
Bath
Street
,
and
I
turned
*NL*
directly
into
a
shop
that
he
might
not
speak
to
me
;
I
would
not
even
*NL*
look
at
him
.
He
went
into
the
pump-room
afterwards
;
but
I
would
not
have
*NL*
followed
him
for
all
the
world
.
Such
a
contrast
between
him
and
your
*NL*
brother
!
Pray
send
me
some
news
of
the
latter
--
I
am
quite
unhappy
about
*NL*
him
;
he
seemed
so
uncomfortable
when
he
went
away
,
with
a
cold
,
or
*NL*
something
that
affected
his
spirits
.
I
would
write
to
him
myself
,
but
*NL*
have
mislaid
his
direction
;
and
,
as
I
hinted
above
,
am
afraid
he
*NL*
took
something
in
my
conduct
amiss
.
Pray
explain
everything
to
his
*NL*
satisfaction
;
or
,
if
he
still
harbours
any
doubt
,
a
line
from
himself
*NL*
to
me
,
or
a
call
at
Putney
when
next
in
town
,
might
set
all
to
rights
.
*NL*
I
have
not
been
to
the
rooms
this
age
,
nor
to
the
play
,
except
going
in
*NL*
last
night
with
the
Hodges
,
for
a
frolic
,
at
half
price
:
they
teased
*NL*
me
into
it
;
and
I
was
determined
they
should
not
say
I
shut
myself
up
*NL*
because
Tilney
was
gone
.
We
happened
to
sit
by
the
Mitchells
,
and
they
*NL*
pretended
to
be
quite
surprised
to
see
me
out
.
I
knew
their
spite
:
at
*NL*
one
time
they
could
not
be
civil
to
me
,
but
now
they
are
all
friendship
;
*NL*
but
I
am
not
such
a
fool
as
to
be
taken
in
by
them
.
You
know
I
have
a
*NL*
pretty
good
spirit
of
my
own
.
Anne
Mitchell
had
tried
to
put
on
a
*NL*
turban
like
mine
,
as
I
wore
it
the
week
before
at
the
concert
,
but
made
*NL*
wretched
work
of
it
--
it
happened
to
become
my
odd
face
,
I
believe
,
at
*NL*
least
Tilney
told
me
so
at
the
time
,
and
said
every
eye
was
upon
me
;
but
*NL*
he
is
the
last
man
whose
word
I
would
take
.
I
wear
nothing
but
purple
*NL*
now
:
I
know
I
look
hideous
in
it
,
but
no
matter
--
it
is
your
dear
*NL*
brother
's
favourite
colour
.
Lose
no
time
,
my
dearest
,
sweetest
*NL*
Catherine
,
in
writing
to
him
and
to
me
,
Who
ever
am
,
etc.
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Such
a
strain
of
shallow
artifice
could
not
impose
even
upon
Catherine
.
*NL*
Its
inconsistencies
,
contradictions
,
and
falsehood
struck
her
from
the
*NL*
very
first
.
She
was
ashamed
of
Isabella
,
and
ashamed
of
having
ever
*NL*
loved
her
.
Her
professions
of
attachment
were
now
as
disgusting
as
her
*NL*
excuses
were
empty
,
and
her
demands
impudent
.
``
Write
to
James
on
her
*NL*
behalf
!
No
,
James
should
never
hear
Isabella
's
name
mentioned
by
her
*NL*
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
Henry
's
arrival
from
Woodston
,
she
made
known
to
him
and
Eleanor
*NL*
their
brother
's
safety
,
congratulating
them
with
sincerity
on
it
,
and
*NL*
reading
aloud
the
most
material
passages
of
her
letter
with
strong
*NL*
indignation
.
When
she
had
finished
it
--
``
So
much
for
Isabella
,
''
she
*NL*
cried
,
``
and
for
all
our
intimacy
!
She
must
think
me
an
idiot
,
or
she
*NL*
could
not
have
written
so
;
but
perhaps
this
has
served
to
make
her
*NL*
character
better
known
to
me
than
mine
is
to
her
.
I
see
what
she
has
*NL*
been
about
.
She
is
a
vain
coquette
,
and
her
tricks
have
not
answered
.
I
*NL*
do
not
believe
she
had
ever
any
regard
either
for
James
or
for
me
,
and
I
*NL*
wish
I
had
never
known
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
will
soon
be
as
if
you
never
had
,
''
said
Henry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
but
one
thing
that
I
can
not
understand
.
I
see
that
she
has
*NL*
had
designs
on
Captain
Tilney
,
which
have
not
succeeded
;
but
I
do
not
*NL*
understand
what
Captain
Tilney
has
been
about
all
this
time
.
Why
should
*NL*
he
pay
her
such
attentions
as
to
make
her
quarrel
with
my
brother
,
and
*NL*
then
fly
off
himself
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
very
little
to
say
for
Frederick
's
motives
,
such
as
I
believe
*NL*
them
to
have
been
.
He
has
his
vanities
as
well
as
Miss
Thorpe
,
and
the
*NL*
chief
difference
is
,
that
,
having
a
stronger
head
,
they
have
not
yet
*NL*
injured
himself
.
If
the
effect
of
his
behaviour
does
not
justify
him
*NL*
with
you
,
we
had
better
not
seek
after
the
cause
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
do
not
suppose
he
ever
really
cared
about
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
persuaded
that
he
never
did
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
only
made
believe
to
do
so
for
mischief
's
sake
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Henry
bowed
his
assent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
I
must
say
that
I
do
not
like
him
at
all
.
Though
it
has
*NL*
turned
out
so
well
for
us
,
I
do
not
like
him
at
all
.
As
it
happens
,
*NL*
there
is
no
great
harm
done
,
because
I
do
not
think
Isabella
has
any
*NL*
heart
to
lose
.
But
,
suppose
he
had
made
her
very
much
in
love
with
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
we
must
first
suppose
Isabella
to
have
had
a
heart
to
*NL*
lose
--
consequently
to
have
been
a
very
different
creature
;
and
,
in
that
*NL*
case
,
she
would
have
met
with
very
different
treatment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
very
right
that
you
should
stand
by
your
brother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
if
you
would
stand
by
yours
,
you
would
not
be
much
distressed
by
*NL*
the
disappointment
of
Miss
Thorpe
.
But
your
mind
is
warped
by
an
innate
*NL*
principle
of
general
integrity
,
and
therefore
not
accessible
to
the
cool
*NL*
reasonings
of
family
partiality
,
or
a
desire
of
revenge
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Catherine
was
complimented
out
of
further
bitterness
.
Frederick
could
*NL*
not
be
unpardonably
guilty
,
while
Henry
made
himself
so
agreeable
.
She
*NL*
resolved
on
not
answering
Isabella
's
letter
,
and
tried
to
think
no
more
*NL*
of
it
.

CHAPTER
28
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Soon
after
this
,
the
general
found
himself
obliged
to
go
to
London
for
*NL*
a
week
;
and
he
left
Northanger
earnestly
regretting
that
any
necessity
*NL*
should
rob
him
even
for
an
hour
of
Miss
Morland
's
company
,
and
anxiously
*NL*
recommending
the
study
of
her
comfort
and
amusement
to
his
children
*NL*
as
their
chief
object
in
his
absence
.
His
departure
gave
Catherine
the
*NL*
first
experimental
conviction
that
a
loss
may
be
sometimes
a
gain
.
The
*NL*
happiness
with
which
their
time
now
passed
,
every
employment
voluntary
,
*NL*
every
laugh
indulged
,
every
meal
a
scene
of
ease
and
good
humour
,
*NL*
walking
where
they
liked
and
when
they
liked
,
their
hours
,
pleasures
,
*NL*
and
fatigues
at
their
own
command
,
made
her
thoroughly
sensible
of
the
*NL*
restraint
which
the
general
's
presence
had
imposed
,
and
most
thankfully
*NL*
feel
their
present
release
from
it
.
Such
ease
and
such
delights
made
her
*NL*
love
the
place
and
the
people
more
and
more
every
day
;
and
had
it
not
*NL*
been
for
a
dread
of
its
soon
becoming
expedient
to
leave
the
one
,
and
*NL*
an
apprehension
of
not
being
equally
beloved
by
the
other
,
she
would
at
*NL*
each
moment
of
each
day
have
been
perfectly
happy
;
but
she
was
now
in
*NL*
the
fourth
week
of
her
visit
;
before
the
general
came
home
,
the
fourth
*NL*
week
would
be
turned
,
and
perhaps
it
might
seem
an
intrusion
if
she
*NL*
stayed
much
longer
.
This
was
a
painful
consideration
whenever
it
*NL*
occurred
;
and
eager
to
get
rid
of
such
a
weight
on
her
mind
,
she
very
*NL*
soon
resolved
to
speak
to
Eleanor
about
it
at
once
,
propose
going
away
,
*NL*
and
be
guided
in
her
conduct
by
the
manner
in
which
her
proposal
might
*NL*
be
taken
.
*NL*
*NL*
Aware
that
if
she
gave
herself
much
time
,
she
might
feel
it
difficult
to
*NL*
bring
forward
so
unpleasant
a
subject
,
she
took
the
first
opportunity
of
*NL*
being
suddenly
alone
with
Eleanor
,
and
of
Eleanor
's
being
in
the
*NL*
middle
of
a
speech
about
something
very
different
,
to
start
forth
her
*NL*
obligation
of
going
away
very
soon
.
Eleanor
looked
and
declared
herself
*NL*
much
concerned
.
She
had
``
hoped
for
the
pleasure
of
her
company
for
a
*NL*
much
longer
time
--
had
been
misled
-LRB-
perhaps
by
her
wishes
-RRB-
to
suppose
*NL*
that
a
much
longer
visit
had
been
promised
--
and
could
not
but
think
that
*NL*
if
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Morland
were
aware
of
the
pleasure
it
was
to
her
to
have
*NL*
her
there
,
they
would
be
too
generous
to
hasten
her
return
.
''
Catherine
*NL*
explained
:
``
Oh
!
As
to
that
,
Papa
and
Mamma
were
in
no
hurry
at
all
.
As
*NL*
long
as
she
was
happy
,
they
would
always
be
satisfied
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
why
,
might
she
ask
,
in
such
a
hurry
herself
to
leave
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
Because
she
had
been
there
so
long
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
if
you
can
use
such
a
word
,
I
can
urge
you
no
farther
.
If
you
*NL*
think
it
long
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
No
,
I
do
not
indeed
.
For
my
own
pleasure
,
I
could
stay
with
you
as
*NL*
long
again
.
''
And
it
was
directly
settled
that
,
till
she
had
,
her
leaving
*NL*
them
was
not
even
to
be
thought
of
.
In
having
this
cause
of
uneasiness
*NL*
so
pleasantly
removed
,
the
force
of
the
other
was
likewise
weakened
.
The
*NL*
kindness
,
the
earnestness
of
Eleanor
's
manner
in
pressing
her
to
stay
,
*NL*
and
Henry
's
gratified
look
on
being
told
that
her
stay
was
determined
,
*NL*
were
such
sweet
proofs
of
her
importance
with
them
,
as
left
her
only
*NL*
just
so
much
solicitude
as
the
human
mind
can
never
do
comfortably
*NL*
without
.
She
did
--
almost
always
--
believe
that
Henry
loved
her
,
and
quite
*NL*
always
that
his
father
and
sister
loved
and
even
wished
her
to
belong
*NL*
to
them
;
and
believing
so
far
,
her
doubts
and
anxieties
were
merely
*NL*
sportive
irritations
.
*NL*
*NL*
Henry
was
not
able
to
obey
his
father
's
injunction
of
remaining
wholly
*NL*
at
Northanger
in
attendance
on
the
ladies
,
during
his
absence
in
London
,
*NL*
the
engagements
of
his
curate
at
Woodston
obliging
him
to
leave
them
on
*NL*
Saturday
for
a
couple
of
nights
.
His
loss
was
not
now
what
it
had
been
*NL*
while
the
general
was
at
home
;
it
lessened
their
gaiety
,
but
did
not
*NL*
ruin
their
comfort
;
and
the
two
girls
agreeing
in
occupation
,
and
*NL*
improving
in
intimacy
,
found
themselves
so
well
sufficient
for
the
time
*NL*
to
themselves
,
that
it
was
eleven
o'clock
,
rather
a
late
hour
at
*NL*
the
abbey
,
before
they
quitted
the
supper-room
on
the
day
of
Henry
's
*NL*
departure
.
They
had
just
reached
the
head
of
the
stairs
when
it
seemed
,
*NL*
as
far
as
the
thickness
of
the
walls
would
allow
them
to
judge
,
that
a
*NL*
carriage
was
driving
up
to
the
door
,
and
the
next
moment
confirmed
the
*NL*
idea
by
the
loud
noise
of
the
house-bell
.
After
the
first
perturbation
*NL*
of
surprise
had
passed
away
,
in
a
``
Good
heaven
!
What
can
be
the
matter
?
''
*NL*
it
was
quickly
decided
by
Eleanor
to
be
her
eldest
brother
,
whose
*NL*
arrival
was
often
as
sudden
,
if
not
quite
so
unseasonable
,
and
*NL*
accordingly
she
hurried
down
to
welcome
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Catherine
walked
on
to
her
chamber
,
making
up
her
mind
as
well
as
she
*NL*
could
,
to
a
further
acquaintance
with
Captain
Tilney
,
and
comforting
*NL*
herself
under
the
unpleasant
impression
his
conduct
had
given
her
,
and
*NL*
the
persuasion
of
his
being
by
far
too
fine
a
gentleman
to
approve
of
*NL*
her
,
that
at
least
they
should
not
meet
under
such
circumstances
as
*NL*
would
make
their
meeting
materially
painful
.
She
trusted
he
would
never
*NL*
speak
of
Miss
Thorpe
;
and
indeed
,
as
he
must
by
this
time
be
ashamed
of
*NL*
the
part
he
had
acted
,
there
could
be
no
danger
of
it
;
and
as
long
as
*NL*
all
mention
of
Bath
scenes
were
avoided
,
she
thought
she
could
behave
*NL*
to
him
very
civilly
.
In
such
considerations
time
passed
away
,
and
it
was
*NL*
certainly
in
his
favour
that
Eleanor
should
be
so
glad
to
see
him
,
and
*NL*
have
so
much
to
say
,
for
half
an
hour
was
almost
gone
since
his
arrival
,
*NL*
and
Eleanor
did
not
come
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
Catherine
thought
she
heard
her
step
in
the
gallery
,
and
*NL*
listened
for
its
continuance
;
but
all
was
silent
.
Scarcely
,
however
,
*NL*
had
she
convicted
her
fancy
of
error
,
when
the
noise
of
something
moving
*NL*
close
to
her
door
made
her
start
;
it
seemed
as
if
someone
was
touching
*NL*
the
very
doorway
--
and
in
another
moment
a
slight
motion
of
the
lock
*NL*
proved
that
some
hand
must
be
on
it
.
She
trembled
a
little
at
the
idea
*NL*
of
anyone
's
approaching
so
cautiously
;
but
resolving
not
to
be
again
*NL*
overcome
by
trivial
appearances
of
alarm
,
or
misled
by
a
raised
*NL*
imagination
,
she
stepped
quietly
forward
,
and
opened
the
door
.
Eleanor
,
*NL*
and
only
Eleanor
,
stood
there
.
Catherine
's
spirits
,
however
,
were
*NL*
tranquillized
but
for
an
instant
,
for
Eleanor
's
cheeks
were
pale
,
and
*NL*
her
manner
greatly
agitated
.
Though
evidently
intending
to
come
in
,
it
*NL*
seemed
an
effort
to
enter
the
room
,
and
a
still
greater
to
speak
when
*NL*
there
.
Catherine
,
supposing
some
uneasiness
on
Captain
Tilney
's
account
,
*NL*
could
only
express
her
concern
by
silent
attention
,
obliged
her
to
be
*NL*
seated
,
rubbed
her
temples
with
lavender-water
,
and
hung
over
her
with
*NL*
affectionate
solicitude
.
``
My
dear
Catherine
,
you
must
not
--
you
must
not
*NL*
indeed
--
''
were
Eleanor
's
first
connected
words
.
``
I
am
quite
well
.
*NL*
This
kindness
distracts
me
--
I
can
not
bear
it
--
I
come
to
you
on
such
an
*NL*
errand
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Errand
!
To
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
shall
I
tell
you
!
Oh
!
How
shall
I
tell
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
new
idea
now
darted
into
Catherine
's
mind
,
and
turning
as
pale
as
her
*NL*
friend
,
she
exclaimed
,
''
'T
is
a
messenger
from
Woodston
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
mistaken
,
indeed
,
''
returned
Eleanor
,
looking
at
her
most
*NL*
compassionately
;
``
it
is
no
one
from
Woodston
.
It
is
my
father
himself
.
''
*NL*
Her
voice
faltered
,
and
her
eyes
were
turned
to
the
ground
as
she
*NL*
mentioned
his
name
.
His
unlooked-for
return
was
enough
in
itself
to
make
*NL*
Catherine
's
heart
sink
,
and
for
a
few
moments
she
hardly
supposed
*NL*
there
were
anything
worse
to
be
told
.
She
said
nothing
;
and
Eleanor
,
*NL*
endeavouring
to
collect
herself
and
speak
with
firmness
,
but
with
eyes
*NL*
still
cast
down
,
soon
went
on
.
``
You
are
too
good
,
I
am
sure
,
to
think
*NL*
the
worse
of
me
for
the
part
I
am
obliged
to
perform
.
I
am
indeed
a
most
*NL*
unwilling
messenger
.
After
what
has
so
lately
passed
,
so
lately
been
*NL*
settled
between
us
--
how
joyfully
,
how
thankfully
on
my
side
!
--
as
to
your
*NL*
continuing
here
as
I
hoped
for
many
,
many
weeks
longer
,
how
can
I
tell
*NL*
you
that
your
kindness
is
not
to
be
accepted
--
and
that
the
happiness
*NL*
your
company
has
hitherto
given
us
is
to
be
repaid
by
--
But
I
must
not
*NL*
trust
myself
with
words
.
My
dear
Catherine
,
we
are
to
part
.
My
father
*NL*
has
recollected
an
engagement
that
takes
our
whole
family
away
on
*NL*
Monday
.
We
are
going
to
Lord
Longtown
's
,
near
Hereford
,
for
a
fortnight
.
*NL*
Explanation
and
apology
are
equally
impossible
.
I
can
not
attempt
*NL*
either
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Eleanor
,
''
cried
Catherine
,
suppressing
her
feelings
as
well
as
*NL*
she
could
,
``
do
not
be
so
distressed
.
A
second
engagement
must
give
*NL*
way
to
a
first
.
I
am
very
,
very
sorry
we
are
to
part
--
so
soon
,
and
so
*NL*
suddenly
too
;
but
I
am
not
offended
,
indeed
I
am
not
.
I
can
finish
my
*NL*
visit
here
,
you
know
,
at
any
time
;
or
I
hope
you
will
come
to
me
.
Can
*NL*
you
,
when
you
return
from
this
lord
's
,
come
to
Fullerton
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
will
not
be
in
my
power
,
Catherine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
when
you
can
,
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Eleanor
made
no
answer
;
and
Catherine
's
thoughts
recurring
to
something
*NL*
more
directly
interesting
,
she
added
,
thinking
aloud
,
``
Monday
--
so
soon
*NL*
as
Monday
;
and
you
all
go
.
Well
,
I
am
certain
of
--
I
shall
be
able
to
*NL*
take
leave
,
however
.
I
need
not
go
till
just
before
you
do
,
you
know
.
Do
*NL*
not
be
distressed
,
Eleanor
,
I
can
go
on
Monday
very
well
.
My
father
*NL*
and
mother
's
having
no
notice
of
it
is
of
very
little
consequence
.
The
*NL*
general
will
send
a
servant
with
me
,
I
dare
say
,
half
the
way
--
and
then
*NL*
I
shall
soon
be
at
Salisbury
,
and
then
I
am
only
nine
miles
from
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
Catherine
!
Were
it
settled
so
,
it
would
be
somewhat
less
*NL*
intolerable
,
though
in
such
common
attentions
you
would
have
received
*NL*
but
half
what
you
ought
.
But
--
how
can
I
tell
you
?
--
tomorrow
morning
is
*NL*
fixed
for
your
leaving
us
,
and
not
even
the
hour
is
left
to
your
choice
;
*NL*
the
very
carriage
is
ordered
,
and
will
be
here
at
seven
o'clock
,
and
no
*NL*
servant
will
be
offered
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Catherine
sat
down
,
breathless
and
speechless
.
``
I
could
hardly
believe
*NL*
my
senses
,
when
I
heard
it
;
and
no
displeasure
,
no
resentment
that
*NL*
you
can
feel
at
this
moment
,
however
justly
great
,
can
be
more
than
I
*NL*
myself
--
but
I
must
not
talk
of
what
I
felt
.
Oh
!
That
I
could
suggest
*NL*
anything
in
extenuation
!
Good
God
!
What
will
your
father
and
mother
say
!
*NL*
After
courting
you
from
the
protection
of
real
friends
to
this
--
almost
*NL*
double
distance
from
your
home
,
to
have
you
driven
out
of
the
house
,
*NL*
without
the
considerations
even
of
decent
civility
!
Dear
,
dear
*NL*
Catherine
,
in
being
the
bearer
of
such
a
message
,
I
seem
guilty
myself
*NL*
of
all
its
insult
;
yet
,
I
trust
you
will
acquit
me
,
for
you
must
have
*NL*
been
long
enough
in
this
house
to
see
that
I
am
but
a
nominal
mistress
*NL*
of
it
,
that
my
real
power
is
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
I
offended
the
general
?
''
said
Catherine
in
a
faltering
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas
!
For
my
feelings
as
a
daughter
,
all
that
I
know
,
all
that
I
*NL*
answer
for
,
is
that
you
can
have
given
him
no
just
cause
of
offence
.
He
*NL*
certainly
is
greatly
,
very
greatly
discomposed
;
I
have
seldom
seen
him
*NL*
more
so
.
His
temper
is
not
happy
,
and
something
has
now
occurred
to
*NL*
ruffle
it
in
an
uncommon
degree
;
some
disappointment
,
some
vexation
,
*NL*
which
just
at
this
moment
seems
important
,
but
which
I
can
hardly
*NL*
suppose
you
to
have
any
concern
in
,
for
how
is
it
possible
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
with
pain
that
Catherine
could
speak
at
all
;
and
it
was
only
for
*NL*
Eleanor
's
sake
that
she
attempted
it
.
``
I
am
sure
,
''
said
she
,
``
I
am
very
*NL*
sorry
if
I
have
offended
him
.
It
was
the
last
thing
I
would
willingly
*NL*
have
done
.
But
do
not
be
unhappy
,
Eleanor
.
An
engagement
,
you
know
,
must
*NL*
be
kept
.
I
am
only
sorry
it
was
not
recollected
sooner
,
that
I
might
*NL*
have
written
home
.
But
it
is
of
very
little
consequence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
,
I
earnestly
hope
,
that
to
your
real
safety
it
will
be
of
none
;
*NL*
but
to
everything
else
it
is
of
the
greatest
consequence
:
to
comfort
,
*NL*
appearance
,
propriety
,
to
your
family
,
to
the
world
.
Were
your
friends
,
*NL*
the
Allens
,
still
in
Bath
,
you
might
go
to
them
with
comparative
ease
;
*NL*
a
few
hours
would
take
you
there
;
but
a
journey
of
seventy
miles
,
to
be
*NL*
taken
post
by
you
,
at
your
age
,
alone
,
unattended
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
the
journey
is
nothing
.
Do
not
think
about
that
.
And
if
we
are
to
*NL*
part
,
a
few
hours
sooner
or
later
,
you
know
,
makes
no
difference
.
I
*NL*
can
be
ready
by
seven
.
Let
me
be
called
in
time
.
''
Eleanor
saw
that
she
*NL*
wished
to
be
alone
;
and
believing
it
better
for
each
that
they
should
*NL*
avoid
any
further
conversation
,
now
left
her
with
,
``
I
shall
see
you
in
*NL*
the
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Catherine
's
swelling
heart
needed
relief
.
In
Eleanor
's
presence
*NL*
friendship
and
pride
had
equally
restrained
her
tears
,
but
no
sooner
was
*NL*
she
gone
than
they
burst
forth
in
torrents
.
Turned
from
the
house
,
and
*NL*
in
such
a
way
!
Without
any
reason
that
could
justify
,
any
apology
that
*NL*
could
atone
for
the
abruptness
,
the
rudeness
,
nay
,
the
insolence
of
*NL*
it
.
Henry
at
a
distance
--
not
able
even
to
bid
him
farewell
.
Every
hope
,
*NL*
every
expectation
from
him
suspended
,
at
least
,
and
who
could
say
how
*NL*
long
?
Who
could
say
when
they
might
meet
again
?
And
all
this
by
such
*NL*
a
man
as
General
Tilney
,
so
polite
,
so
well
bred
,
and
heretofore
*NL*
so
particularly
fond
of
her
!
It
was
as
incomprehensible
as
it
was
*NL*
mortifying
and
grievous
.
From
what
it
could
arise
,
and
where
it
would
*NL*
end
,
were
considerations
of
equal
perplexity
and
alarm
.
The
manner
in
*NL*
which
it
was
done
so
grossly
uncivil
,
hurrying
her
away
without
any
*NL*
reference
to
her
own
convenience
,
or
allowing
her
even
the
appearance
*NL*
of
choice
as
to
the
time
or
mode
of
her
travelling
;
of
two
days
,
the
*NL*
earliest
fixed
on
,
and
of
that
almost
the
earliest
hour
,
as
if
resolved
*NL*
to
have
her
gone
before
he
was
stirring
in
the
morning
,
that
he
*NL*
might
not
be
obliged
even
to
see
her
.
What
could
all
this
mean
but
*NL*
an
intentional
affront
?
By
some
means
or
other
she
must
have
had
the
*NL*
misfortune
to
offend
him
.
Eleanor
had
wished
to
spare
her
from
so
*NL*
painful
a
notion
,
but
Catherine
could
not
believe
it
possible
that
any
*NL*
injury
or
any
misfortune
could
provoke
such
ill
will
against
a
person
*NL*
not
connected
,
or
,
at
least
,
not
supposed
to
be
connected
with
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Heavily
passed
the
night
.
Sleep
,
or
repose
that
deserved
the
name
*NL*
of
sleep
,
was
out
of
the
question
.
That
room
,
in
which
her
disturbed
*NL*
imagination
had
tormented
her
on
her
first
arrival
,
was
again
the
scene
*NL*
of
agitated
spirits
and
unquiet
slumbers
.
Yet
how
different
now
the
*NL*
source
of
her
inquietude
from
what
it
had
been
then
--
how
mournfully
*NL*
superior
in
reality
and
substance
!
Her
anxiety
had
foundation
in
*NL*
fact
,
her
fears
in
probability
;
and
with
a
mind
so
occupied
in
the
*NL*
contemplation
of
actual
and
natural
evil
,
the
solitude
of
her
situation
,
*NL*
the
darkness
of
her
chamber
,
the
antiquity
of
the
building
,
were
felt
*NL*
and
considered
without
the
smallest
emotion
;
and
though
the
wind
was
*NL*
high
,
and
often
produced
strange
and
sudden
noises
throughout
the
house
,
*NL*
she
heard
it
all
as
she
lay
awake
,
hour
after
hour
,
without
curiosity
or
*NL*
terror
.
*NL*
*NL*
Soon
after
six
Eleanor
entered
her
room
,
eager
to
show
attention
or
give
*NL*
assistance
where
it
was
possible
;
but
very
little
remained
to
be
done
.
*NL*
Catherine
had
not
loitered
;
she
was
almost
dressed
,
and
her
packing
*NL*
almost
finished
.
The
possibility
of
some
conciliatory
message
from
the
*NL*
general
occurred
to
her
as
his
daughter
appeared
.
What
so
natural
,
as
*NL*
that
anger
should
pass
away
and
repentance
succeed
it
?
And
she
only
*NL*
wanted
to
know
how
far
,
after
what
had
passed
,
an
apology
might
properly
*NL*
be
received
by
her
.
But
the
knowledge
would
have
been
useless
here
;
*NL*
it
was
not
called
for
;
neither
clemency
nor
dignity
was
put
to
the
*NL*
trial
--
Eleanor
brought
no
message
.
Very
little
passed
between
them
on
*NL*
meeting
;
each
found
her
greatest
safety
in
silence
,
and
few
and
trivial
*NL*
were
the
sentences
exchanged
while
they
remained
upstairs
,
Catherine
in
*NL*
busy
agitation
completing
her
dress
,
and
Eleanor
with
more
goodwill
than
*NL*
experience
intent
upon
filling
the
trunk
.
When
everything
was
done
they
*NL*
left
the
room
,
Catherine
lingering
only
half
a
minute
behind
her
friend
*NL*
to
throw
a
parting
glance
on
every
well-known
,
cherished
object
,
and
*NL*
went
down
to
the
breakfast-parlour
,
where
breakfast
was
prepared
.
She
*NL*
tried
to
eat
,
as
well
to
save
herself
from
the
pain
of
being
urged
as
*NL*
to
make
her
friend
comfortable
;
but
she
had
no
appetite
,
and
could
not
*NL*
swallow
many
mouthfuls
.
The
contrast
between
this
and
her
last
breakfast
*NL*
in
that
room
gave
her
fresh
misery
,
and
strengthened
her
distaste
for
*NL*
everything
before
her
.
It
was
not
four
and
twenty
hours
ago
since
they
*NL*
had
met
there
to
the
same
repast
,
but
in
circumstances
how
different
!
*NL*
With
what
cheerful
ease
,
what
happy
,
though
false
,
security
,
had
she
*NL*
then
looked
around
her
,
enjoying
everything
present
,
and
fearing
little
*NL*
in
future
,
beyond
Henry
's
going
to
Woodston
for
a
day
!
Happy
,
happy
*NL*
breakfast
!
For
Henry
had
been
there
;
Henry
had
sat
by
her
and
helped
*NL*
her
.
These
reflections
were
long
indulged
undisturbed
by
any
address
*NL*
from
her
companion
,
who
sat
as
deep
in
thought
as
herself
;
and
the
*NL*
appearance
of
the
carriage
was
the
first
thing
to
startle
and
recall
*NL*
them
to
the
present
moment
.
Catherine
's
colour
rose
at
the
sight
of
it
;
*NL*
and
the
indignity
with
which
she
was
treated
,
striking
at
that
instant
*NL*
on
her
mind
with
peculiar
force
,
made
her
for
a
short
time
sensible
only
*NL*
of
resentment
.
Eleanor
seemed
now
impelled
into
resolution
and
speech
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
write
to
me
,
Catherine
,
''
she
cried
;
``
you
must
let
me
hear
from
*NL*
you
as
soon
as
possible
.
Till
I
know
you
to
be
safe
at
home
,
I
shall
*NL*
not
have
an
hour
's
comfort
.
For
one
letter
,
at
all
risks
,
all
hazards
,
I
*NL*
must
entreat
.
Let
me
have
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
you
are
safe
*NL*
at
Fullerton
,
and
have
found
your
family
well
,
and
then
,
till
I
can
ask
*NL*
for
your
correspondence
as
I
ought
to
do
,
I
will
not
expect
more
.
Direct
*NL*
to
me
at
Lord
Longtown
's
,
and
,
I
must
ask
it
,
under
cover
to
Alice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Eleanor
,
if
you
are
not
allowed
to
receive
a
letter
from
me
,
I
am
*NL*
sure
I
had
better
not
write
.
There
can
be
no
doubt
of
my
getting
home
*NL*
safe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Eleanor
only
replied
,
``
I
can
not
wonder
at
your
feelings
.
I
will
not
*NL*
importune
you
.
I
will
trust
to
your
own
kindness
of
heart
when
I
am
at
*NL*
a
distance
from
you
.
''
But
this
,
with
the
look
of
sorrow
accompanying
*NL*
it
,
was
enough
to
melt
Catherine
's
pride
in
a
moment
,
and
she
instantly
*NL*
said
,
``
Oh
,
Eleanor
,
I
will
write
to
you
indeed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
yet
another
point
which
Miss
Tilney
was
anxious
to
settle
,
*NL*
though
somewhat
embarrassed
in
speaking
of
.
It
had
occurred
to
her
that
*NL*
after
so
long
an
absence
from
home
,
Catherine
might
not
be
provided
with
*NL*
money
enough
for
the
expenses
of
her
journey
,
and
,
upon
suggesting
it
*NL*
to
her
with
most
affectionate
offers
of
accommodation
,
it
proved
to
be
*NL*
exactly
the
case
.
Catherine
had
never
thought
on
the
subject
till
that
*NL*
moment
,
but
,
upon
examining
her
purse
,
was
convinced
that
but
for
*NL*
this
kindness
of
her
friend
,
she
might
have
been
turned
from
the
house
*NL*
without
even
the
means
of
getting
home
;
and
the
distress
in
which
she
*NL*
must
have
been
thereby
involved
filling
the
minds
of
both
,
scarcely
*NL*
another
word
was
said
by
either
during
the
time
of
their
remaining
*NL*
together
.
Short
,
however
,
was
that
time
.
The
carriage
was
soon
announced
*NL*
to
be
ready
;
and
Catherine
,
instantly
rising
,
a
long
and
affectionate
*NL*
embrace
supplied
the
place
of
language
in
bidding
each
other
adieu
;
and
,
*NL*
as
they
entered
the
hall
,
unable
to
leave
the
house
without
some
mention
*NL*
of
one
whose
name
had
not
yet
been
spoken
by
either
,
she
paused
a
*NL*
moment
,
and
with
quivering
lips
just
made
it
intelligible
that
she
left
*NL*
``
her
kind
remembrance
for
her
absent
friend
.
''
But
with
this
approach
to
*NL*
his
name
ended
all
possibility
of
restraining
her
feelings
;
and
,
hiding
*NL*
her
face
as
well
as
she
could
with
her
handkerchief
,
she
darted
across
*NL*
the
hall
,
jumped
into
the
chaise
,
and
in
a
moment
was
driven
from
the
*NL*
door
.

CHAPTER
29
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Catherine
was
too
wretched
to
be
fearful
.
The
journey
in
itself
had
no
*NL*
terrors
for
her
;
and
she
began
it
without
either
dreading
its
length
or
*NL*
feeling
its
solitariness
.
Leaning
back
in
one
corner
of
the
carriage
,
in
*NL*
a
violent
burst
of
tears
,
she
was
conveyed
some
miles
beyond
the
walls
*NL*
of
the
abbey
before
she
raised
her
head
;
and
the
highest
point
of
ground
*NL*
within
the
park
was
almost
closed
from
her
view
before
she
was
capable
*NL*
of
turning
her
eyes
towards
it
.
Unfortunately
,
the
road
she
now
*NL*
travelled
was
the
same
which
only
ten
days
ago
she
had
so
happily
passed
*NL*
along
in
going
to
and
from
Woodston
;
and
,
for
fourteen
miles
,
every
*NL*
bitter
feeling
was
rendered
more
severe
by
the
review
of
objects
on
*NL*
which
she
had
first
looked
under
impressions
so
different
.
Every
mile
,
*NL*
as
it
brought
her
nearer
Woodston
,
added
to
her
sufferings
,
and
when
*NL*
within
the
distance
of
five
,
she
passed
the
turning
which
led
to
it
,
and
*NL*
thought
of
Henry
,
so
near
,
yet
so
unconscious
,
her
grief
and
agitation
*NL*
were
excessive
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
day
which
she
had
spent
at
that
place
had
been
one
of
the
happiest
*NL*
of
her
life
.
It
was
there
,
it
was
on
that
day
,
that
the
general
had
made
*NL*
use
of
such
expressions
with
regard
to
Henry
and
herself
,
had
so
*NL*
spoken
and
so
looked
as
to
give
her
the
most
positive
conviction
of
his
*NL*
actually
wishing
their
marriage
.
Yes
,
only
ten
days
ago
had
he
*NL*
elated
her
by
his
pointed
regard
--
had
he
even
confused
her
by
his
too
*NL*
significant
reference
!
And
now
--
what
had
she
done
,
or
what
had
she
*NL*
omitted
to
do
,
to
merit
such
a
change
?
*NL*
*NL*
The
only
offence
against
him
of
which
she
could
accuse
herself
had
been
*NL*
such
as
was
scarcely
possible
to
reach
his
knowledge
.
Henry
and
her
own
*NL*
heart
only
were
privy
to
the
shocking
suspicions
which
she
had
so
idly
*NL*
entertained
;
and
equally
safe
did
she
believe
her
secret
with
each
.
*NL*
Designedly
,
at
least
,
Henry
could
not
have
betrayed
her
.
If
,
indeed
,
by
*NL*
any
strange
mischance
his
father
should
have
gained
intelligence
of
*NL*
what
she
had
dared
to
think
and
look
for
,
of
her
causeless
fancies
*NL*
and
injurious
examinations
,
she
could
not
wonder
at
any
degree
of
his
*NL*
indignation
.
If
aware
of
her
having
viewed
him
as
a
murderer
,
she
could
*NL*
not
wonder
at
his
even
turning
her
from
his
house
.
But
a
justification
*NL*
so
full
of
torture
to
herself
,
she
trusted
,
would
not
be
in
his
power
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anxious
as
were
all
her
conjectures
on
this
point
,
it
was
not
,
however
,
*NL*
the
one
on
which
she
dwelt
most
.
There
was
a
thought
yet
nearer
,
a
more
*NL*
prevailing
,
more
impetuous
concern
.
How
Henry
would
think
,
and
feel
,
*NL*
and
look
,
when
he
returned
on
the
morrow
to
Northanger
and
heard
of
*NL*
her
being
gone
,
was
a
question
of
force
and
interest
to
rise
over
every
*NL*
other
,
to
be
never
ceasing
,
alternately
irritating
and
soothing
;
it
*NL*
sometimes
suggested
the
dread
of
his
calm
acquiescence
,
and
at
others
*NL*
was
answered
by
the
sweetest
confidence
in
his
regret
and
resentment
.
To
*NL*
the
general
,
of
course
,
he
would
not
dare
to
speak
;
but
to
Eleanor
--
what
*NL*
might
he
not
say
to
Eleanor
about
her
?
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
unceasing
recurrence
of
doubts
and
inquiries
,
on
any
one
article
*NL*
of
which
her
mind
was
incapable
of
more
than
momentary
repose
,
the
hours
*NL*
passed
away
,
and
her
journey
advanced
much
faster
than
she
looked
for
.
*NL*
The
pressing
anxieties
of
thought
,
which
prevented
her
from
noticing
*NL*
anything
before
her
,
when
once
beyond
the
neighbourhood
of
Woodston
,
*NL*
saved
her
at
the
same
time
from
watching
her
progress
;
and
though
no
*NL*
object
on
the
road
could
engage
a
moment
's
attention
,
she
found
no
stage
*NL*
of
it
tedious
.
From
this
,
she
was
preserved
too
by
another
cause
,
by
*NL*
feeling
no
eagerness
for
her
journey
's
conclusion
;
for
to
return
in
such
*NL*
a
manner
to
Fullerton
was
almost
to
destroy
the
pleasure
of
a
meeting
*NL*
with
those
she
loved
best
,
even
after
an
absence
such
as
hers
--
an
eleven
*NL*
weeks
'
absence
.
What
had
she
to
say
that
would
not
humble
herself
and
*NL*
pain
her
family
,
that
would
not
increase
her
own
grief
by
the
confession
*NL*
of
it
,
extend
an
useless
resentment
,
and
perhaps
involve
the
innocent
*NL*
with
the
guilty
in
undistinguishing
ill
will
?
She
could
never
do
justice
*NL*
to
Henry
and
Eleanor
's
merit
;
she
felt
it
too
strongly
for
expression
;
*NL*
and
should
a
dislike
be
taken
against
them
,
should
they
be
thought
of
*NL*
unfavourably
,
on
their
father
's
account
,
it
would
cut
her
to
the
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
these
feelings
,
she
rather
dreaded
than
sought
for
the
first
view
*NL*
of
that
well-known
spire
which
would
announce
her
within
twenty
miles
of
*NL*
home
.
Salisbury
she
had
known
to
be
her
point
on
leaving
Northanger
;
but
*NL*
after
the
first
stage
she
had
been
indebted
to
the
post-masters
for
the
*NL*
names
of
the
places
which
were
then
to
conduct
her
to
it
;
so
great
*NL*
had
been
her
ignorance
of
her
route
.
She
met
with
nothing
,
however
,
*NL*
to
distress
or
frighten
her
.
Her
youth
,
civil
manners
,
and
liberal
*NL*
pay
procured
her
all
the
attention
that
a
traveller
like
herself
could
*NL*
require
;
and
stopping
only
to
change
horses
,
she
travelled
on
for
*NL*
about
eleven
hours
without
accident
or
alarm
,
and
between
six
and
seven
*NL*
o'clock
in
the
evening
found
herself
entering
Fullerton
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
heroine
returning
,
at
the
close
of
her
career
,
to
her
native
village
,
*NL*
in
all
the
triumph
of
recovered
reputation
,
and
all
the
dignity
of
*NL*
a
countess
,
with
a
long
train
of
noble
relations
in
their
several
*NL*
phaetons
,
and
three
waiting-maids
in
a
travelling
chaise
and
four
,
*NL*
behind
her
,
is
an
event
on
which
the
pen
of
the
contriver
may
well
*NL*
delight
to
dwell
;
it
gives
credit
to
every
conclusion
,
and
the
author
*NL*
must
share
in
the
glory
she
so
liberally
bestows
.
But
my
affair
is
*NL*
widely
different
;
I
bring
back
my
heroine
to
her
home
in
solitude
and
*NL*
disgrace
;
and
no
sweet
elation
of
spirits
can
lead
me
into
minuteness
.
*NL*
A
heroine
in
a
hack
post-chaise
is
such
a
blow
upon
sentiment
,
as
no
*NL*
attempt
at
grandeur
or
pathos
can
withstand
.
Swiftly
therefore
shall
her
*NL*
post-boy
drive
through
the
village
,
amid
the
gaze
of
Sunday
groups
,
and
*NL*
speedy
shall
be
her
descent
from
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
whatever
might
be
the
distress
of
Catherine
's
mind
,
as
she
thus
*NL*
advanced
towards
the
parsonage
,
and
whatever
the
humiliation
of
her
*NL*
biographer
in
relating
it
,
she
was
preparing
enjoyment
of
no
everyday
*NL*
nature
for
those
to
whom
she
went
;
first
,
in
the
appearance
of
her
*NL*
carriage
--
and
secondly
,
in
herself
.
The
chaise
of
a
traveller
being
*NL*
a
rare
sight
in
Fullerton
,
the
whole
family
were
immediately
at
the
*NL*
window
;
and
to
have
it
stop
at
the
sweep-gate
was
a
pleasure
to
brighten
*NL*
every
eye
and
occupy
every
fancy
--
a
pleasure
quite
unlooked
for
by
all
*NL*
but
the
two
youngest
children
,
a
boy
and
girl
of
six
and
four
years
old
,
*NL*
who
expected
a
brother
or
sister
in
every
carriage
.
Happy
the
glance
*NL*
that
first
distinguished
Catherine
!
Happy
the
voice
that
proclaimed
the
*NL*
discovery
!
But
whether
such
happiness
were
the
lawful
property
of
George
*NL*
or
Harriet
could
never
be
exactly
understood
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
father
,
mother
,
Sarah
,
George
,
and
Harriet
,
all
assembled
at
the
*NL*
door
to
welcome
her
with
affectionate
eagerness
,
was
a
sight
to
awaken
*NL*
the
best
feelings
of
Catherine
's
heart
;
and
in
the
embrace
of
each
,
as
*NL*
she
stepped
from
the
carriage
,
she
found
herself
soothed
beyond
anything
*NL*
that
she
had
believed
possible
.
So
surrounded
,
so
caressed
,
she
was
even
*NL*
happy
!
In
the
joyfulness
of
family
love
everything
for
a
short
time
was
*NL*
subdued
,
and
the
pleasure
of
seeing
her
,
leaving
them
at
first
little
*NL*
leisure
for
calm
curiosity
,
they
were
all
seated
round
the
tea-table
,
*NL*
which
Mrs.
Morland
had
hurried
for
the
comfort
of
the
poor
traveller
,
*NL*
whose
pale
and
jaded
looks
soon
caught
her
notice
,
before
any
inquiry
so
*NL*
direct
as
to
demand
a
positive
answer
was
addressed
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Reluctantly
,
and
with
much
hesitation
,
did
she
then
begin
what
might
*NL*
perhaps
,
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
,
be
termed
,
by
the
courtesy
of
her
*NL*
hearers
,
an
explanation
;
but
scarcely
,
within
that
time
,
could
they
*NL*
at
all
discover
the
cause
,
or
collect
the
particulars
,
of
her
sudden
*NL*
return
.
They
were
far
from
being
an
irritable
race
;
far
from
any
*NL*
quickness
in
catching
,
or
bitterness
in
resenting
,
affronts
:
but
here
,
*NL*
when
the
whole
was
unfolded
,
was
an
insult
not
to
be
overlooked
,
nor
,
*NL*
for
the
first
half
hour
,
to
be
easily
pardoned
.
Without
suffering
any
*NL*
romantic
alarm
,
in
the
consideration
of
their
daughter
's
long
and
lonely
*NL*
journey
,
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Morland
could
not
but
feel
that
it
might
have
been
*NL*
productive
of
much
unpleasantness
to
her
;
that
it
was
what
they
could
*NL*
never
have
voluntarily
suffered
;
and
that
,
in
forcing
her
on
such
*NL*
a
measure
,
General
Tilney
had
acted
neither
honourably
nor
*NL*
feelingly
--
neither
as
a
gentleman
nor
as
a
parent
.
Why
he
had
done
it
,
*NL*
what
could
have
provoked
him
to
such
a
breach
of
hospitality
,
and
so
*NL*
suddenly
turned
all
his
partial
regard
for
their
daughter
into
actual
*NL*
ill
will
,
was
a
matter
which
they
were
at
least
as
far
from
divining
*NL*
as
Catherine
herself
;
but
it
did
not
oppress
them
by
any
means
so
long
;
*NL*
and
,
after
a
due
course
of
useless
conjecture
,
that
``
it
was
a
strange
*NL*
business
,
and
that
he
must
be
a
very
strange
man
,
''
grew
enough
for
all
*NL*
their
indignation
and
wonder
;
though
Sarah
indeed
still
indulged
in
the
*NL*
sweets
of
incomprehensibility
,
exclaiming
and
conjecturing
with
youthful
*NL*
ardour
.
``
My
dear
,
you
give
yourself
a
great
deal
of
needless
trouble
,
''
*NL*
said
her
mother
at
last
;
``
depend
upon
it
,
it
is
something
not
at
all
*NL*
worth
understanding
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
allow
for
his
wishing
Catherine
away
,
when
he
recollected
this
*NL*
engagement
,
''
said
Sarah
,
``
but
why
not
do
it
civilly
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sorry
for
the
young
people
,
''
returned
Mrs.
Morland
;
``
they
must
*NL*
have
a
sad
time
of
it
;
but
as
for
anything
else
,
it
is
no
matter
now
;
*NL*
Catherine
is
safe
at
home
,
and
our
comfort
does
not
depend
upon
General
*NL*
Tilney
.
''
Catherine
sighed
.
``
Well
,
''
continued
her
philosophic
mother
,
``
I
*NL*
am
glad
I
did
not
know
of
your
journey
at
the
time
;
but
now
it
is
all
*NL*
over
,
perhaps
there
is
no
great
harm
done
.
It
is
always
good
for
*NL*
young
people
to
be
put
upon
exerting
themselves
;
and
you
know
,
my
dear
*NL*
Catherine
,
you
always
were
a
sad
little
scatter-brained
creature
;
but
*NL*
now
you
must
have
been
forced
to
have
your
wits
about
you
,
with
so
much
*NL*
changing
of
chaises
and
so
forth
;
and
I
hope
it
will
appear
that
you
*NL*
have
not
left
anything
behind
you
in
any
of
the
pockets
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Catherine
hoped
so
too
,
and
tried
to
feel
an
interest
in
her
own
*NL*
amendment
,
but
her
spirits
were
quite
worn
down
;
and
,
to
be
silent
and
*NL*
alone
becoming
soon
her
only
wish
,
she
readily
agreed
to
her
mother
's
*NL*
next
counsel
of
going
early
to
bed
.
Her
parents
,
seeing
nothing
in
*NL*
her
ill
looks
and
agitation
but
the
natural
consequence
of
mortified
*NL*
feelings
,
and
of
the
unusual
exertion
and
fatigue
of
such
a
journey
,
*NL*
parted
from
her
without
any
doubt
of
their
being
soon
slept
away
;
and
*NL*
though
,
when
they
all
met
the
next
morning
,
her
recovery
was
not
equal
*NL*
to
their
hopes
,
they
were
still
perfectly
unsuspicious
of
there
being
*NL*
any
deeper
evil
.
They
never
once
thought
of
her
heart
,
which
,
for
the
*NL*
parents
of
a
young
lady
of
seventeen
,
just
returned
from
her
first
*NL*
excursion
from
home
,
was
odd
enough
!
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
breakfast
was
over
,
she
sat
down
to
fulfil
her
promise
to
*NL*
Miss
Tilney
,
whose
trust
in
the
effect
of
time
and
distance
on
her
*NL*
friend
's
disposition
was
already
justified
,
for
already
did
Catherine
*NL*
reproach
herself
with
having
parted
from
Eleanor
coldly
,
with
*NL*
having
never
enough
valued
her
merits
or
kindness
,
and
never
enough
*NL*
commiserated
her
for
what
she
had
been
yesterday
left
to
endure
.
The
*NL*
strength
of
these
feelings
,
however
,
was
far
from
assisting
her
pen
;
*NL*
and
never
had
it
been
harder
for
her
to
write
than
in
addressing
Eleanor
*NL*
Tilney
.
To
compose
a
letter
which
might
at
once
do
justice
to
her
*NL*
sentiments
and
her
situation
,
convey
gratitude
without
servile
regret
,
*NL*
be
guarded
without
coldness
,
and
honest
without
resentment
--
a
letter
*NL*
which
Eleanor
might
not
be
pained
by
the
perusal
of
--
and
,
above
all
,
*NL*
which
she
might
not
blush
herself
,
if
Henry
should
chance
to
see
,
was
an
*NL*
undertaking
to
frighten
away
all
her
powers
of
performance
;
and
,
after
*NL*
long
thought
and
much
perplexity
,
to
be
very
brief
was
all
that
she
*NL*
could
determine
on
with
any
confidence
of
safety
.
The
money
therefore
*NL*
which
Eleanor
had
advanced
was
enclosed
with
little
more
than
grateful
*NL*
thanks
,
and
the
thousand
good
wishes
of
a
most
affectionate
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
has
been
a
strange
acquaintance
,
''
observed
Mrs.
Morland
,
as
the
*NL*
letter
was
finished
;
``
soon
made
and
soon
ended
.
I
am
sorry
it
happens
*NL*
so
,
for
Mrs.
Allen
thought
them
very
pretty
kind
of
young
people
;
and
*NL*
you
were
sadly
out
of
luck
too
in
your
Isabella
.
Ah
!
Poor
James
!
Well
,
*NL*
we
must
live
and
learn
;
and
the
next
new
friends
you
make
I
hope
will
be
*NL*
better
worth
keeping
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Catherine
coloured
as
she
warmly
answered
,
``
No
friend
can
be
better
*NL*
worth
keeping
than
Eleanor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
so
,
my
dear
,
I
dare
say
you
will
meet
again
some
time
or
other
;
do
*NL*
not
be
uneasy
.
It
is
ten
to
one
but
you
are
thrown
together
again
in
the
*NL*
course
of
a
few
years
;
and
then
what
a
pleasure
it
will
be
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Morland
was
not
happy
in
her
attempt
at
consolation
.
The
hope
*NL*
of
meeting
again
in
the
course
of
a
few
years
could
only
put
into
*NL*
Catherine
's
head
what
might
happen
within
that
time
to
make
a
meeting
*NL*
dreadful
to
her
.
She
could
never
forget
Henry
Tilney
,
or
think
of
him
*NL*
with
less
tenderness
than
she
did
at
that
moment
;
but
he
might
forget
*NL*
her
;
and
in
that
case
,
to
meet
--
!
Her
eyes
filled
with
tears
as
she
*NL*
pictured
her
acquaintance
so
renewed
;
and
her
mother
,
perceiving
her
*NL*
comfortable
suggestions
to
have
had
no
good
effect
,
proposed
,
as
another
*NL*
expedient
for
restoring
her
spirits
,
that
they
should
call
on
Mrs.
*NL*
Allen
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
houses
were
only
a
quarter
of
a
mile
apart
;
and
,
as
they
walked
,
*NL*
Mrs.
Morland
quickly
dispatched
all
that
she
felt
on
the
score
of
*NL*
James
's
disappointment
.
``
We
are
sorry
for
him
,
''
said
she
;
``
but
otherwise
*NL*
there
is
no
harm
done
in
the
match
going
off
;
for
it
could
not
be
*NL*
a
desirable
thing
to
have
him
engaged
to
a
girl
whom
we
had
not
the
*NL*
smallest
acquaintance
with
,
and
who
was
so
entirely
without
fortune
;
and
*NL*
now
,
after
such
behaviour
,
we
can
not
think
at
all
well
of
her
.
Just
at
*NL*
present
it
comes
hard
to
poor
James
;
but
that
will
not
last
forever
;
and
*NL*
I
dare
say
he
will
be
a
discreeter
man
all
his
life
,
for
the
foolishness
*NL*
of
his
first
choice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
just
such
a
summary
view
of
the
affair
as
Catherine
could
*NL*
listen
to
;
another
sentence
might
have
endangered
her
complaisance
,
*NL*
and
made
her
reply
less
rational
;
for
soon
were
all
her
thinking
powers
*NL*
swallowed
up
in
the
reflection
of
her
own
change
of
feelings
and
spirits
*NL*
since
last
she
had
trodden
that
well-known
road
.
It
was
not
three
months
*NL*
ago
since
,
wild
with
joyful
expectation
,
she
had
there
run
backwards
*NL*
and
forwards
some
ten
times
a
day
,
with
an
heart
light
,
gay
,
and
*NL*
independent
;
looking
forward
to
pleasures
untasted
and
unalloyed
,
and
*NL*
free
from
the
apprehension
of
evil
as
from
the
knowledge
of
it
.
Three
*NL*
months
ago
had
seen
her
all
this
;
and
now
,
how
altered
a
being
did
she
*NL*
return
!
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
received
by
the
Allens
with
all
the
kindness
which
her
*NL*
unlooked-for
appearance
,
acting
on
a
steady
affection
,
would
naturally
*NL*
call
forth
;
and
great
was
their
surprise
,
and
warm
their
displeasure
,
*NL*
on
hearing
how
she
had
been
treated
--
though
Mrs.
Morland
's
account
of
*NL*
it
was
no
inflated
representation
,
no
studied
appeal
to
their
passions
.
*NL*
``
Catherine
took
us
quite
by
surprise
yesterday
evening
,
''
said
she
.
``
She
*NL*
travelled
all
the
way
post
by
herself
,
and
knew
nothing
of
coming
till
*NL*
Saturday
night
;
for
General
Tilney
,
from
some
odd
fancy
or
other
,
all
*NL*
of
a
sudden
grew
tired
of
having
her
there
,
and
almost
turned
her
out
*NL*
of
the
house
.
Very
unfriendly
,
certainly
;
and
he
must
be
a
very
odd
*NL*
man
;
but
we
are
so
glad
to
have
her
amongst
us
again
!
And
it
is
a
great
*NL*
comfort
to
find
that
she
is
not
a
poor
helpless
creature
,
but
can
shift
*NL*
very
well
for
herself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Allen
expressed
himself
on
the
occasion
with
the
reasonable
*NL*
resentment
of
a
sensible
friend
;
and
Mrs.
Allen
thought
his
expressions
*NL*
quite
good
enough
to
be
immediately
made
use
of
again
by
herself
.
His
*NL*
wonder
,
his
conjectures
,
and
his
explanations
became
in
succession
hers
,
*NL*
with
the
addition
of
this
single
remark
--
``
I
really
have
not
patience
*NL*
with
the
general
''
--
to
fill
up
every
accidental
pause
.
And
,
``
I
really
*NL*
have
not
patience
with
the
general
,
''
was
uttered
twice
after
Mr.
*NL*
Allen
left
the
room
,
without
any
relaxation
of
anger
,
or
any
material
*NL*
digression
of
thought
.
A
more
considerable
degree
of
wandering
attended
*NL*
the
third
repetition
;
and
,
after
completing
the
fourth
,
she
immediately
*NL*
added
,
``
Only
think
,
my
dear
,
of
my
having
got
that
frightful
great
rent
*NL*
in
my
best
Mechlin
so
charmingly
mended
,
before
I
left
Bath
,
that
one
*NL*
can
hardly
see
where
it
was
.
I
must
show
it
you
some
day
or
other
.
Bath
*NL*
is
a
nice
place
,
Catherine
,
after
all
.
I
assure
you
I
did
not
above
half
*NL*
like
coming
away
.
Mrs.
Thorpe
's
being
there
was
such
a
comfort
to
us
,
*NL*
was
not
it
?
You
know
,
you
and
I
were
quite
forlorn
at
first
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
that
did
not
last
long
,
''
said
Catherine
,
her
eyes
brightening
*NL*
at
the
recollection
of
what
had
first
given
spirit
to
her
existence
*NL*
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
true
:
we
soon
met
with
Mrs.
Thorpe
,
and
then
we
wanted
for
*NL*
nothing
.
My
dear
,
do
not
you
think
these
silk
gloves
wear
very
well
?
*NL*
I
put
them
on
new
the
first
time
of
our
going
to
the
Lower
Rooms
,
you
*NL*
know
,
and
I
have
worn
them
a
great
deal
since
.
Do
you
remember
that
*NL*
evening
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
I
!
Oh
!
Perfectly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
very
agreeable
,
was
not
it
?
Mr.
Tilney
drank
tea
with
us
,
and
I
*NL*
always
thought
him
a
great
addition
,
he
is
so
very
agreeable
.
I
have
a
*NL*
notion
you
danced
with
him
,
but
am
not
quite
sure
.
I
remember
I
had
my
*NL*
favourite
gown
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Catherine
could
not
answer
;
and
,
after
a
short
trial
of
other
subjects
,
*NL*
Mrs.
Allen
again
returned
to
--
``
I
really
have
not
patience
with
the
*NL*
general
!
Such
an
agreeable
,
worthy
man
as
he
seemed
to
be
!
I
do
not
*NL*
suppose
,
Mrs.
Morland
,
you
ever
saw
a
better-bred
man
in
your
life
.
His
*NL*
lodgings
were
taken
the
very
day
after
he
left
them
,
Catherine
.
But
no
*NL*
wonder
;
Milsom
Street
,
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
walked
home
again
,
Mrs.
Morland
endeavoured
to
impress
on
her
*NL*
daughter
's
mind
the
happiness
of
having
such
steady
well-wishers
as
Mr.
*NL*
and
Mrs.
Allen
,
and
the
very
little
consideration
which
the
neglect
or
*NL*
unkindness
of
slight
acquaintance
like
the
Tilneys
ought
to
have
with
*NL*
her
,
while
she
could
preserve
the
good
opinion
and
affection
of
her
*NL*
earliest
friends
.
There
was
a
great
deal
of
good
sense
in
all
this
;
but
*NL*
there
are
some
situations
of
the
human
mind
in
which
good
sense
has
*NL*
very
little
power
;
and
Catherine
's
feelings
contradicted
almost
every
*NL*
position
her
mother
advanced
.
It
was
upon
the
behaviour
of
these
very
*NL*
slight
acquaintance
that
all
her
present
happiness
depended
;
and
*NL*
while
Mrs.
Morland
was
successfully
confirming
her
own
opinions
by
the
*NL*
justness
of
her
own
representations
,
Catherine
was
silently
reflecting
*NL*
that
now
Henry
must
have
arrived
at
Northanger
;
now
he
must
have
heard
*NL*
of
her
departure
;
and
now
,
perhaps
,
they
were
all
setting
off
for
*NL*
Hereford
.

CHAPTER
30
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Catherine
's
disposition
was
not
naturally
sedentary
,
nor
had
her
habits
*NL*
been
ever
very
industrious
;
but
whatever
might
hitherto
have
been
her
*NL*
defects
of
that
sort
,
her
mother
could
not
but
perceive
them
now
to
be
*NL*
greatly
increased
.
She
could
neither
sit
still
nor
employ
herself
for
*NL*
ten
minutes
together
,
walking
round
the
garden
and
orchard
again
and
*NL*
again
,
as
if
nothing
but
motion
was
voluntary
;
and
it
seemed
as
if
she
*NL*
could
even
walk
about
the
house
rather
than
remain
fixed
for
any
time
*NL*
in
the
parlour
.
Her
loss
of
spirits
was
a
yet
greater
alteration
.
In
her
*NL*
rambling
and
her
idleness
she
might
only
be
a
caricature
of
herself
;
but
*NL*
in
her
silence
and
sadness
she
was
the
very
reverse
of
all
that
she
had
*NL*
been
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
two
days
Mrs.
Morland
allowed
it
to
pass
even
without
a
hint
;
*NL*
but
when
a
third
night
's
rest
had
neither
restored
her
cheerfulness
,
*NL*
improved
her
in
useful
activity
,
nor
given
her
a
greater
inclination
for
*NL*
needlework
,
she
could
no
longer
refrain
from
the
gentle
reproof
of
,
``
My
*NL*
dear
Catherine
,
I
am
afraid
you
are
growing
quite
a
fine
lady
.
I
do
not
*NL*
know
when
poor
Richard
's
cravats
would
be
done
,
if
he
had
no
friend
*NL*
but
you
.
Your
head
runs
too
much
upon
Bath
;
but
there
is
a
time
for
*NL*
everything
--
a
time
for
balls
and
plays
,
and
a
time
for
work
.
You
have
*NL*
had
a
long
run
of
amusement
,
and
now
you
must
try
to
be
useful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Catherine
took
up
her
work
directly
,
saying
,
in
a
dejected
voice
,
that
*NL*
``
her
head
did
not
run
upon
Bath
--
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
are
fretting
about
General
Tilney
,
and
that
is
very
simple
*NL*
of
you
;
for
ten
to
one
whether
you
ever
see
him
again
.
You
should
never
*NL*
fret
about
trifles
.
''
After
a
short

I
hope
,
my
Catherine
,
you
*NL*
are
not
getting
out
of
humour
with
home
because
it
is
not
so
grand
*NL*
as
Northanger
.
That
would
be
turning
your
visit
into
an
evil
indeed
.
*NL*
Wherever
you
are
you
should
always
be
contented
,
but
especially
at
home
,
*NL*
because
there
you
must
spend
the
most
of
your
time
.
I
did
not
quite
*NL*
like
,
at
breakfast
,
to
hear
you
talk
so
much
about
the
French
bread
at
*NL*
Northanger
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sure
I
do
not
care
about
the
bread

It
is
all
the
same
to
me
what
*NL*
I
eat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
a
very
clever
essay
in
one
of
the
books
upstairs
upon
much
*NL*
such
a
subject
,
about
young
girls
that
have
been
spoilt
for
home
by
*NL*
great
acquaintance
--
The
Mirror
,
I
think
.
I
will
look
it
out
for
you
some
*NL*
day
or
other
,
because
I
am
sure
it
will
do
you
good
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Catherine
said
no
more
,
and
,
with
an
endeavour
to
do
right
,
applied
*NL*
to
her
work
;
but
,
after
a
few
minutes
,
sunk
again
,
without
knowing
it
*NL*
herself
,
into
languor
and
listlessness
,
moving
herself
in
her
chair
,
*NL*
from
the
irritation
of
weariness
,
much
oftener
than
she
moved
her
*NL*
needle
.
Mrs.
Morland
watched
the
progress
of
this
relapse
;
and
seeing
,
*NL*
in
her
daughter
's
absent
and
dissatisfied
look
,
the
full
proof
of
that
*NL*
repining
spirit
to
which
she
had
now
begun
to
attribute
her
want
of
*NL*
cheerfulness
,
hastily
left
the
room
to
fetch
the
book
in
question
,
*NL*
anxious
to
lose
no
time
in
attacking
so
dreadful
a
malady
.
It
was
some
*NL*
time
before
she
could
find
what
she
looked
for
;
and
other
family
matters
*NL*
occurring
to
detain
her
,
a
quarter
of
an
hour
had
elapsed
ere
she
*NL*
returned
downstairs
with
the
volume
from
which
so
much
was
hoped
.
Her
*NL*
avocations
above
having
shut
out
all
noise
but
what
she
created
herself
,
*NL*
she
knew
not
that
a
visitor
had
arrived
within
the
last
few
minutes
,
*NL*
till
,
on
entering
the
room
,
the
first
object
she
beheld
was
a
young
*NL*
man
whom
she
had
never
seen
before
.
With
a
look
of
much
respect
,
he
*NL*
immediately
rose
,
and
being
introduced
to
her
by
her
conscious
daughter
*NL*
as
``
Mr.
Henry
Tilney
,
''
with
the
embarrassment
of
real
sensibility
began
*NL*
to
apologize
for
his
appearance
there
,
acknowledging
that
after
what
had
*NL*
passed
he
had
little
right
to
expect
a
welcome
at
Fullerton
,
and
stating
*NL*
his
impatience
to
be
assured
of
Miss
Morland
's
having
reached
her
home
*NL*
in
safety
,
as
the
cause
of
his
intrusion
.
He
did
not
address
himself
to
*NL*
an
uncandid
judge
or
a
resentful
heart
.
Far
from
comprehending
him
or
*NL*
his
sister
in
their
father
's
misconduct
,
Mrs.
Morland
had
been
always
*NL*
kindly
disposed
towards
each
,
and
instantly
,
pleased
by
his
appearance
,
*NL*
received
him
with
the
simple
professions
of
unaffected
benevolence
;
*NL*
thanking
him
for
such
an
attention
to
her
daughter
,
assuring
him
that
*NL*
the
friends
of
her
children
were
always
welcome
there
,
and
entreating
*NL*
him
to
say
not
another
word
of
the
past
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
not
ill-inclined
to
obey
this
request
,
for
,
though
his
heart
was
*NL*
greatly
relieved
by
such
unlooked-for
mildness
,
it
was
not
just
at
that
*NL*
moment
in
his
power
to
say
anything
to
the
purpose
.
Returning
in
silence
*NL*
to
his
seat
,
therefore
,
he
remained
for
some
minutes
most
civilly
*NL*
answering
all
Mrs.
Morland
's
common
remarks
about
the
weather
and
*NL*
roads
.
Catherine
meanwhile
--
the
anxious
,
agitated
,
happy
,
feverish
*NL*
Catherine
--
said
not
a
word
;
but
her
glowing
cheek
and
brightened
eye
*NL*
made
her
mother
trust
that
this
good-natured
visit
would
at
least
set
*NL*
her
heart
at
ease
for
a
time
,
and
gladly
therefore
did
she
lay
aside
the
*NL*
first
volume
of
The
Mirror
for
a
future
hour
.
*NL*
*NL*
Desirous
of
Mr.
Morland
's
assistance
,
as
well
in
giving
encouragement
,
*NL*
as
in
finding
conversation
for
her
guest
,
whose
embarrassment
on
his
*NL*
father
's
account
she
earnestly
pitied
,
Mrs.
Morland
had
very
early
*NL*
dispatched
one
of
the
children
to
summon
him
;
but
Mr.
Morland
was
from
*NL*
home
--
and
being
thus
without
any
support
,
at
the
end
of
a
quarter
of
*NL*
an
hour
she
had
nothing
to
say
.
After
a
couple
of
minutes
'
unbroken
*NL*
silence
,
Henry
,
turning
to
Catherine
for
the
first
time
since
her
*NL*
mother
's
entrance
,
asked
her
,
with
sudden
alacrity
,
if
Mr.
and
Mrs.
*NL*
Allen
were
now
at
Fullerton
?
And
on
developing
,
from
amidst
all
her
*NL*
perplexity
of
words
in
reply
,
the
meaning
,
which
one
short
syllable
*NL*
would
have
given
,
immediately
expressed
his
intention
of
paying
his
*NL*
respects
to
them
,
and
,
with
a
rising
colour
,
asked
her
if
she
would
*NL*
have
the
goodness
to
show
him
the
way
.
``
You
may
see
the
house
from
this
*NL*
window
,
sir
,
''
was
information
on
Sarah
's
side
,
which
produced
only
a
*NL*
bow
of
acknowledgment
from
the
gentleman
,
and
a
silencing
nod
from
*NL*
her
mother
;
for
Mrs.
Morland
,
thinking
it
probable
,
as
a
secondary
*NL*
consideration
in
his
wish
of
waiting
on
their
worthy
neighbours
,
that
he
*NL*
might
have
some
explanation
to
give
of
his
father
's
behaviour
,
which
it
*NL*
must
be
more
pleasant
for
him
to
communicate
only
to
Catherine
,
would
*NL*
not
on
any
account
prevent
her
accompanying
him
.
They
began
their
walk
,
*NL*
and
Mrs.
Morland
was
not
entirely
mistaken
in
his
object
in
wishing
it
.
*NL*
Some
explanation
on
his
father
's
account
he
had
to
give
;
but
his
first
*NL*
purpose
was
to
explain
himself
,
and
before
they
reached
Mr.
Allen
's
*NL*
grounds
he
had
done
it
so
well
that
Catherine
did
not
think
it
could
*NL*
ever
be
repeated
too
often
.
She
was
assured
of
his
affection
;
and
that
*NL*
heart
in
return
was
solicited
,
which
,
perhaps
,
they
pretty
equally
*NL*
knew
was
already
entirely
his
own
;
for
,
though
Henry
was
now
sincerely
*NL*
attached
to
her
,
though
he
felt
and
delighted
in
all
the
excellencies
*NL*
of
her
character
and
truly
loved
her
society
,
I
must
confess
that
his
*NL*
affection
originated
in
nothing
better
than
gratitude
,
or
,
in
other
*NL*
words
,
that
a
persuasion
of
her
partiality
for
him
had
been
the
only
*NL*
cause
of
giving
her
a
serious
thought
.
It
is
a
new
circumstance
in
*NL*
romance
,
I
acknowledge
,
and
dreadfully
derogatory
of
an
heroine
's
*NL*
dignity
;
but
if
it
be
as
new
in
common
life
,
the
credit
of
a
wild
*NL*
imagination
will
at
least
be
all
my
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
very
short
visit
to
Mrs.
Allen
,
in
which
Henry
talked
at
random
,
*NL*
without
sense
or
connection
,
and
Catherine
,
rapt
in
the
contemplation
of
*NL*
her
own
unutterable
happiness
,
scarcely
opened
her
lips
,
dismissed
them
*NL*
to
the
ecstasies
of
another
tete-a-tete
;
and
before
it
was
suffered
to
*NL*
close
,
she
was
enabled
to
judge
how
far
he
was
sanctioned
by
parental
*NL*
authority
in
his
present
application
.
On
his
return
from
Woodston
,
two
*NL*
days
before
,
he
had
been
met
near
the
abbey
by
his
impatient
father
,
*NL*
hastily
informed
in
angry
terms
of
Miss
Morland
's
departure
,
and
ordered
*NL*
to
think
of
her
no
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
was
the
permission
upon
which
he
had
now
offered
her
his
hand
.
*NL*
The
affrighted
Catherine
,
amidst
all
the
terrors
of
expectation
,
as
she
*NL*
listened
to
this
account
,
could
not
but
rejoice
in
the
kind
caution
*NL*
with
which
Henry
had
saved
her
from
the
necessity
of
a
conscientious
*NL*
rejection
,
by
engaging
her
faith
before
he
mentioned
the
subject
;
and
*NL*
as
he
proceeded
to
give
the
particulars
,
and
explain
the
motives
of
*NL*
his
father
's
conduct
,
her
feelings
soon
hardened
into
even
a
triumphant
*NL*
delight
.
The
general
had
had
nothing
to
accuse
her
of
,
nothing
to
lay
*NL*
to
her
charge
,
but
her
being
the
involuntary
,
unconscious
object
of
a
*NL*
deception
which
his
pride
could
not
pardon
,
and
which
a
better
pride
*NL*
would
have
been
ashamed
to
own
.
She
was
guilty
only
of
being
less
rich
*NL*
than
he
had
supposed
her
to
be
.
Under
a
mistaken
persuasion
of
her
*NL*
possessions
and
claims
,
he
had
courted
her
acquaintance
in
Bath
,
*NL*
solicited
her
company
at
Northanger
,
and
designed
her
for
his
*NL*
daughter-in-law
.
On
discovering
his
error
,
to
turn
her
from
the
house
*NL*
seemed
the
best
,
though
to
his
feelings
an
inadequate
proof
of
his
*NL*
resentment
towards
herself
,
and
his
contempt
of
her
family
.
*NL*
*NL*
John
Thorpe
had
first
misled
him
.
The
general
,
perceiving
his
son
*NL*
one
night
at
the
theatre
to
be
paying
considerable
attention
to
Miss
*NL*
Morland
,
had
accidentally
inquired
of
Thorpe
if
he
knew
more
of
her
*NL*
than
her
name
.
Thorpe
,
most
happy
to
be
on
speaking
terms
with
a
man
*NL*
of
General
Tilney
's
importance
,
had
been
joyfully
and
proudly
*NL*
communicative
;
and
being
at
that
time
not
only
in
daily
expectation
*NL*
of
Morland
's
engaging
Isabella
,
but
likewise
pretty
well
resolved
upon
*NL*
marrying
Catherine
himself
,
his
vanity
induced
him
to
represent
the
*NL*
family
as
yet
more
wealthy
than
his
vanity
and
avarice
had
made
him
*NL*
believe
them
.
With
whomsoever
he
was
,
or
was
likely
to
be
connected
,
his
*NL*
own
consequence
always
required
that
theirs
should
be
great
,
and
as
his
*NL*
intimacy
with
any
acquaintance
grew
,
so
regularly
grew
their
fortune
.
*NL*
The
expectations
of
his
friend
Morland
,
therefore
,
from
the
first
*NL*
overrated
,
had
ever
since
his
introduction
to
Isabella
been
gradually
*NL*
increasing
;
and
by
merely
adding
twice
as
much
for
the
grandeur
of
the
*NL*
moment
,
by
doubling
what
he
chose
to
think
the
amount
of
Mr.
Morland
's
*NL*
preferment
,
trebling
his
private
fortune
,
bestowing
a
rich
aunt
,
and
*NL*
sinking
half
the
children
,
he
was
able
to
represent
the
whole
family
*NL*
to
the
general
in
a
most
respectable
light
.
For
Catherine
,
however
,
the
*NL*
peculiar
object
of
the
general
's
curiosity
,
and
his
own
speculations
,
*NL*
he
had
yet
something
more
in
reserve
,
and
the
ten
or
fifteen
thousand
*NL*
pounds
which
her
father
could
give
her
would
be
a
pretty
addition
to
Mr.
*NL*
Allen
's
estate
.
Her
intimacy
there
had
made
him
seriously
determine
on
*NL*
her
being
handsomely
legacied
hereafter
;
and
to
speak
of
her
therefore
*NL*
as
the
almost
acknowledged
future
heiress
of
Fullerton
naturally
*NL*
followed
.
Upon
such
intelligence
the
general
had
proceeded
;
for
never
*NL*
had
it
occurred
to
him
to
doubt
its
authority
.
Thorpe
's
interest
in
the
*NL*
family
,
by
his
sister
's
approaching
connection
with
one
of
its
members
,
*NL*
and
his
own
views
on
another
-LRB-
circumstances
of
which
he
boasted
with
*NL*
almost
equal
openness
-RRB-
,
seemed
sufficient
vouchers
for
his
truth
;
and
*NL*
to
these
were
added
the
absolute
facts
of
the
Allens
being
wealthy
and
*NL*
childless
,
of
Miss
Morland
's
being
under
their
care
,
and
--
as
soon
as
his
*NL*
acquaintance
allowed
him
to
judge
--
of
their
treating
her
with
parental
*NL*
kindness
.
His
resolution
was
soon
formed
.
Already
had
he
discerned
a
*NL*
liking
towards
Miss
Morland
in
the
countenance
of
his
son
;
and
thankful
*NL*
for
Mr.
Thorpe
's
communication
,
he
almost
instantly
determined
to
spare
*NL*
no
pains
in
weakening
his
boasted
interest
and
ruining
his
dearest
*NL*
hopes
.
Catherine
herself
could
not
be
more
ignorant
at
the
time
of
all
*NL*
this
,
than
his
own
children
.
Henry
and
Eleanor
,
perceiving
nothing
in
*NL*
her
situation
likely
to
engage
their
father
's
particular
respect
,
had
*NL*
seen
with
astonishment
the
suddenness
,
continuance
,
and
extent
of
his
*NL*
attention
;
and
though
latterly
,
from
some
hints
which
had
accompanied
an
*NL*
almost
positive
command
to
his
son
of
doing
everything
in
his
power
to
*NL*
attach
her
,
Henry
was
convinced
of
his
father
's
believing
it
to
be
*NL*
an
advantageous
connection
,
it
was
not
till
the
late
explanation
at
*NL*
Northanger
that
they
had
the
smallest
idea
of
the
false
calculations
*NL*
which
had
hurried
him
on
.
That
they
were
false
,
the
general
had
learnt
*NL*
from
the
very
person
who
had
suggested
them
,
from
Thorpe
himself
,
whom
*NL*
he
had
chanced
to
meet
again
in
town
,
and
who
,
under
the
influence
of
*NL*
exactly
opposite
feelings
,
irritated
by
Catherine
's
refusal
,
and
*NL*
yet
more
by
the
failure
of
a
very
recent
endeavour
to
accomplish
a
*NL*
reconciliation
between
Morland
and
Isabella
,
convinced
that
they
were
*NL*
separated
forever
,
and
spurning
a
friendship
which
could
be
no
longer
*NL*
serviceable
,
hastened
to
contradict
all
that
he
had
said
before
to
*NL*
the
advantage
of
the
Morlands
--
confessed
himself
to
have
been
totally
*NL*
mistaken
in
his
opinion
of
their
circumstances
and
character
,
misled
by
*NL*
the
rhodomontade
of
his
friend
to
believe
his
father
a
man
of
substance
*NL*
and
credit
,
whereas
the
transactions
of
the
two
or
three
last
weeks
*NL*
proved
him
to
be
neither
;
for
after
coming
eagerly
forward
on
the
first
*NL*
overture
of
a
marriage
between
the
families
,
with
the
most
liberal
*NL*
proposals
,
he
had
,
on
being
brought
to
the
point
by
the
shrewdness
of
*NL*
the
relator
,
been
constrained
to
acknowledge
himself
incapable
of
*NL*
giving
the
young
people
even
a
decent
support
.
They
were
,
in
fact
,
a
*NL*
necessitous
family
;
numerous
,
too
,
almost
beyond
example
;
by
no
means
*NL*
respected
in
their
own
neighbourhood
,
as
he
had
lately
had
particular
*NL*
opportunities
of
discovering
;
aiming
at
a
style
of
life
which
their
*NL*
fortune
could
not
warrant
;
seeking
to
better
themselves
by
wealthy
*NL*
connections
;
a
forward
,
bragging
,
scheming
race
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
terrified
general
pronounced
the
name
of
Allen
with
an
inquiring
*NL*
look
;
and
here
too
Thorpe
had
learnt
his
error
.
The
Allens
,
he
believed
,
*NL*
had
lived
near
them
too
long
,
and
he
knew
the
young
man
on
whom
the
*NL*
Fullerton
estate
must
devolve
.
The
general
needed
no
more
.
Enraged
with
*NL*
almost
everybody
in
the
world
but
himself
,
he
set
out
the
next
day
for
*NL*
the
abbey
,
where
his
performances
have
been
seen
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
leave
it
to
my
reader
's
sagacity
to
determine
how
much
of
all
this
*NL*
it
was
possible
for
Henry
to
communicate
at
this
time
to
Catherine
,
how
*NL*
much
of
it
he
could
have
learnt
from
his
father
,
in
what
points
his
own
*NL*
conjectures
might
assist
him
,
and
what
portion
must
yet
remain
to
be
*NL*
told
in
a
letter
from
James
.
I
have
united
for
their
ease
what
they
must
*NL*
divide
for
mine
.
Catherine
,
at
any
rate
,
heard
enough
to
feel
that
in
*NL*
suspecting
General
Tilney
of
either
murdering
or
shutting
up
his
wife
,
*NL*
she
had
scarcely
sinned
against
his
character
,
or
magnified
his
cruelty
.
*NL*
*NL*
Henry
,
in
having
such
things
to
relate
of
his
father
,
was
almost
*NL*
as
pitiable
as
in
their
first
avowal
to
himself
.
He
blushed
for
the
*NL*
narrow-minded
counsel
which
he
was
obliged
to
expose
.
The
conversation
*NL*
between
them
at
Northanger
had
been
of
the
most
unfriendly
kind
.
Henry
's
*NL*
indignation
on
hearing
how
Catherine
had
been
treated
,
on
comprehending
*NL*
his
father
's
views
,
and
being
ordered
to
acquiesce
in
them
,
had
been
*NL*
open
and
bold
.
The
general
,
accustomed
on
every
ordinary
occasion
to
*NL*
give
the
law
in
his
family
,
prepared
for
no
reluctance
but
of
feeling
,
*NL*
no
opposing
desire
that
should
dare
to
clothe
itself
in
words
,
could
ill
*NL*
brook
the
opposition
of
his
son
,
steady
as
the
sanction
of
reason
and
*NL*
the
dictate
of
conscience
could
make
it
.
But
,
in
such
a
cause
,
his
*NL*
anger
,
though
it
must
shock
,
could
not
intimidate
Henry
,
who
was
*NL*
sustained
in
his
purpose
by
a
conviction
of
its
justice
.
He
felt
himself
*NL*
bound
as
much
in
honour
as
in
affection
to
Miss
Morland
,
and
believing
*NL*
that
heart
to
be
his
own
which
he
had
been
directed
to
gain
,
no
unworthy
*NL*
retraction
of
a
tacit
consent
,
no
reversing
decree
of
unjustifiable
*NL*
anger
,
could
shake
his
fidelity
,
or
influence
the
resolutions
it
*NL*
prompted
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
steadily
refused
to
accompany
his
father
into
Herefordshire
,
an
*NL*
engagement
formed
almost
at
the
moment
to
promote
the
dismissal
of
*NL*
Catherine
,
and
as
steadily
declared
his
intention
of
offering
her
his
*NL*
hand
.
The
general
was
furious
in
his
anger
,
and
they
parted
in
dreadful
*NL*
disagreement
.
Henry
,
in
an
agitation
of
mind
which
many
solitary
hours
*NL*
were
required
to
compose
,
had
returned
almost
instantly
to
Woodston
,
*NL*
and
,
on
the
afternoon
of
the
following
day
,
had
begun
his
journey
to
*NL*
Fullerton
.

CHAPTER
31
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Morland
's
surprise
on
being
applied
to
by
Mr.
Tilney
for
*NL*
their
consent
to
his
marrying
their
daughter
was
,
for
a
few
minutes
,
*NL*
considerable
,
it
having
never
entered
their
heads
to
suspect
an
*NL*
attachment
on
either
side
;
but
as
nothing
,
after
all
,
could
be
more
*NL*
natural
than
Catherine
's
being
beloved
,
they
soon
learnt
to
consider
it
*NL*
with
only
the
happy
agitation
of
gratified
pride
,
and
,
as
far
as
they
*NL*
alone
were
concerned
,
had
not
a
single
objection
to
start
.
His
pleasing
*NL*
manners
and
good
sense
were
self-evident
recommendations
;
and
having
*NL*
never
heard
evil
of
him
,
it
was
not
their
way
to
suppose
any
evil
could
*NL*
be
told
.
Goodwill
supplying
the
place
of
experience
,
his
character
*NL*
needed
no
attestation
.
``
Catherine
would
make
a
sad
,
heedless
young
*NL*
housekeeper
to
be
sure
,
''
was
her
mother
's
foreboding
remark
;
but
quick
*NL*
was
the
consolation
of
there
being
nothing
like
practice
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
but
one
obstacle
,
in
short
,
to
be
mentioned
;
but
till
that
one
*NL*
was
removed
,
it
must
be
impossible
for
them
to
sanction
the
engagement
.
*NL*
Their
tempers
were
mild
,
but
their
principles
were
steady
,
and
while
*NL*
his
parent
so
expressly
forbade
the
connection
,
they
could
not
allow
*NL*
themselves
to
encourage
it
.
That
the
general
should
come
forward
to
*NL*
solicit
the
alliance
,
or
that
he
should
even
very
heartily
approve
it
,
*NL*
they
were
not
refined
enough
to
make
any
parading
stipulation
;
but
*NL*
the
decent
appearance
of
consent
must
be
yielded
,
and
that
once
*NL*
obtained
--
and
their
own
hearts
made
them
trust
that
it
could
not
be
*NL*
very
long
denied
--
their
willing
approbation
was
instantly
to
follow
.
His
*NL*
consent
was
all
that
they
wished
for
.
They
were
no
more
inclined
than
*NL*
entitled
to
demand
his
money
.
Of
a
very
considerable
fortune
,
his
son
*NL*
was
,
by
marriage
settlements
,
eventually
secure
;
his
present
income
was
*NL*
an
income
of
independence
and
comfort
,
and
under
every
pecuniary
view
,
*NL*
it
was
a
match
beyond
the
claims
of
their
daughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
people
could
not
be
surprised
at
a
decision
like
this
.
They
*NL*
felt
and
they
deplored
--
but
they
could
not
resent
it
;
and
they
parted
,
*NL*
endeavouring
to
hope
that
such
a
change
in
the
general
,
as
each
believed
*NL*
almost
impossible
,
might
speedily
take
place
,
to
unite
them
again
in
*NL*
the
fullness
of
privileged
affection
.
Henry
returned
to
what
was
now
*NL*
his
only
home
,
to
watch
over
his
young
plantations
,
and
extend
his
*NL*
improvements
for
her
sake
,
to
whose
share
in
them
he
looked
anxiously
*NL*
forward
;
and
Catherine
remained
at
Fullerton
to
cry
.
Whether
the
*NL*
torments
of
absence
were
softened
by
a
clandestine
correspondence
,
let
*NL*
us
not
inquire
.
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Morland
never
did
--
they
had
been
too
kind
*NL*
to
exact
any
promise
;
and
whenever
Catherine
received
a
letter
,
as
,
at
*NL*
that
time
,
happened
pretty
often
,
they
always
looked
another
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
anxiety
,
which
in
this
state
of
their
attachment
must
be
the
portion
*NL*
of
Henry
and
Catherine
,
and
of
all
who
loved
either
,
as
to
its
final
*NL*
event
,
can
hardly
extend
,
I
fear
,
to
the
bosom
of
my
readers
,
who
will
*NL*
see
in
the
tell-tale
compression
of
the
pages
before
them
,
that
we
are
*NL*
all
hastening
together
to
perfect
felicity
.
The
means
by
which
their
*NL*
early
marriage
was
effected
can
be
the
only
doubt
:
what
probable
*NL*
circumstance
could
work
upon
a
temper
like
the
general
's
?
The
*NL*
circumstance
which
chiefly
availed
was
the
marriage
of
his
daughter
with
*NL*
a
man
of
fortune
and
consequence
,
which
took
place
in
the
course
of
*NL*
the
summer
--
an
accession
of
dignity
that
threw
him
into
a
fit
of
good
*NL*
humour
,
from
which
he
did
not
recover
till
after
Eleanor
had
obtained
*NL*
his
forgiveness
of
Henry
,
and
his
permission
for
him
``
to
be
a
fool
if
he
*NL*
liked
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
marriage
of
Eleanor
Tilney
,
her
removal
from
all
the
evils
of
such
*NL*
a
home
as
Northanger
had
been
made
by
Henry
's
banishment
,
to
the
home
of
*NL*
her
choice
and
the
man
of
her
choice
,
is
an
event
which
I
expect
to
*NL*
give
general
satisfaction
among
all
her
acquaintance
.
My
own
joy
on
the
*NL*
occasion
is
very
sincere
.
I
know
no
one
more
entitled
,
by
unpretending
*NL*
merit
,
or
better
prepared
by
habitual
suffering
,
to
receive
and
enjoy
*NL*
felicity
.
Her
partiality
for
this
gentleman
was
not
of
recent
origin
;
*NL*
and
he
had
been
long
withheld
only
by
inferiority
of
situation
from
*NL*
addressing
her
.
His
unexpected
accession
to
title
and
fortune
had
*NL*
removed
all
his
difficulties
;
and
never
had
the
general
loved
his
*NL*
daughter
so
well
in
all
her
hours
of
companionship
,
utility
,
and
patient
*NL*
endurance
as
when
he
first
hailed
her
``
Your
Ladyship
!
''
Her
husband
was
*NL*
really
deserving
of
her
;
independent
of
his
peerage
,
his
wealth
,
and
*NL*
his
attachment
,
being
to
a
precision
the
most
charming
young
man
in
the
*NL*
world
.
Any
further
definition
of
his
merits
must
be
unnecessary
;
the
*NL*
most
charming
young
man
in
the
world
is
instantly
before
the
imagination
*NL*
of
us
all
.
Concerning
the
one
in
question
,
therefore
,
I
have
only
to
*NL*
add
--
aware
that
the
rules
of
composition
forbid
the
introduction
of
a
*NL*
character
not
connected
with
my
fable
--
that
this
was
the
very
*NL*
gentleman
whose
negligent
servant
left
behind
him
that
collection
of
*NL*
washing-bills
,
resulting
from
a
long
visit
at
Northanger
,
by
which
my
*NL*
heroine
was
involved
in
one
of
her
most
alarming
adventures
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
influence
of
the
viscount
and
viscountess
in
their
brother
's
behalf
*NL*
was
assisted
by
that
right
understanding
of
Mr.
Morland
's
circumstances
*NL*
which
,
as
soon
as
the
general
would
allow
himself
to
be
informed
,
they
*NL*
were
qualified
to
give
.
It
taught
him
that
he
had
been
scarcely
*NL*
more
misled
by
Thorpe
's
first
boast
of
the
family
wealth
than
by
his
*NL*
subsequent
malicious
overthrow
of
it
;
that
in
no
sense
of
the
word
were
*NL*
they
necessitous
or
poor
,
and
that
Catherine
would
have
three
thousand
*NL*
pounds
.
This
was
so
material
an
amendment
of
his
late
expectations
that
*NL*
it
greatly
contributed
to
smooth
the
descent
of
his
pride
;
and
by
no
*NL*
means
without
its
effect
was
the
private
intelligence
,
which
he
was
at
*NL*
some
pains
to
procure
,
that
the
Fullerton
estate
,
being
entirely
at
*NL*
the
disposal
of
its
present
proprietor
,
was
consequently
open
to
every
*NL*
greedy
speculation
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
strength
of
this
,
the
general
,
soon
after
Eleanor
's
marriage
,
*NL*
permitted
his
son
to
return
to
Northanger
,
and
thence
made
him
the
*NL*
bearer
of
his
consent
,
very
courteously
worded
in
a
page
full
of
empty
*NL*
professions
to
Mr.
Morland
.
The
event
which
it
authorized
soon
followed
:
*NL*
Henry
and
Catherine
were
married
,
the
bells
rang
,
and
everybody
smiled
;
*NL*
and
,
as
this
took
place
within
a
twelvemonth
from
the
first
day
of
their
*NL*
meeting
,
it
will
not
appear
,
after
all
the
dreadful
delays
occasioned
by
*NL*
the
general
's
cruelty
,
that
they
were
essentially
hurt
by
it
.
To
begin
*NL*
perfect
happiness
at
the
respective
ages
of
twenty-six
and
eighteen
is
*NL*
to
do
pretty
well
;
and
professing
myself
moreover
convinced
that
the
*NL*
general
's
unjust
interference
,
so
far
from
being
really
injurious
to
*NL*
their
felicity
,
was
perhaps
rather
conducive
to
it
,
by
improving
their
*NL*
knowledge
of
each
other
,
and
adding
strength
to
their
attachment
,
*NL*
I
leave
it
to
be
settled
,
by
whomsoever
it
may
concern
,
whether
the
*NL*
tendency
of
this
work
be
altogether
to
recommend
parental
tyranny
,
or
*NL*
reward
filial
disobedience
.

A

*NL*
Northanger

around
1803
and
sold
to

,
who
sold
it
back
in
