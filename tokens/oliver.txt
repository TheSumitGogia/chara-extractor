*NL*
TREATS
OF
THE
PLACE
WHERE
OLIVER
TWIST
WAS
BORN
AND
OF
THE
*NL*
CIRCUMSTANCES
ATTENDING
HIS
BIRTH
*NL*
*NL*
Among
other
public
buildings
in
a
certain
town
,
which
for
many
reasons
*NL*
it
will
be
prudent
to
refrain
from
mentioning
,
and
to
which
I
will
*NL*
assign
no
fictitious
name
,
there
is
one
anciently
common
to
most
towns
,
*NL*
great
or
small
:
to
wit
,
a
workhouse
;
and
in
this
workhouse
was
born
;
on
*NL*
a
day
and
date
which
I
need
not
trouble
myself
to
repeat
,
inasmuch
as
*NL*
it
can
be
of
no
possible
consequence
to
the
reader
,
in
this
stage
of
*NL*
the
business
at
all
events
;
the
item
of
mortality
whose
name
is
*NL*
prefixed
to
the
head
of
this
chapter
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
long
time
after
it
was
ushered
into
this
world
of
sorrow
and
*NL*
trouble
,
by
the
parish
surgeon
,
it
remained
a
matter
of
considerable
*NL*
doubt
whether
the
child
would
survive
to
bear
any
name
at
all
;
in
which
*NL*
case
it
is
somewhat
more
than
probable
that
these
memoirs
would
never
*NL*
have
appeared
;
or
,
if
they
had
,
that
being
comprised
within
a
couple
of
*NL*
pages
,
they
would
have
possessed
the
inestimable
merit
of
being
the
*NL*
most
concise
and
faithful
specimen
of
biography
,
extant
in
the
*NL*
literature
of
any
age
or
country
.
*NL*
*NL*
Although
I
am
not
disposed
to
maintain
that
the
being
born
in
a
*NL*
workhouse
,
is
in
itself
the
most
fortunate
and
enviable
circumstance
*NL*
that
can
possibly
befall
a
human
being
,
I
do
mean
to
say
that
in
this
*NL*
particular
instance
,
it
was
the
best
thing
for
Oliver
Twist
that
could
*NL*
by
possibility
have
occurred
.
The
fact
is
,
that
there
was
considerable
*NL*
difficulty
in
inducing
Oliver
to
take
upon
himself
the
office
of
*NL*
respiration
,
--
a
troublesome
practice
,
but
one
which
custom
has
rendered
*NL*
necessary
to
our
easy
existence
;
and
for
some
time
he
lay
gasping
on
a
*NL*
little
flock
mattress
,
rather
unequally
poised
between
this
world
and
*NL*
the
next
:
the
balance
being
decidedly
in
favour
of
the
latter
.
Now
,
*NL*
if
,
during
this
brief
period
,
Oliver
had
been
surrounded
by
careful
*NL*
grandmothers
,
anxious
aunts
,
experienced
nurses
,
and
doctors
of
*NL*
profound
wisdom
,
he
would
most
inevitably
and
indubitably
have
been
*NL*
killed
in
no
time
.
There
being
nobody
by
,
however
,
but
a
pauper
old
*NL*
woman
,
who
was
rendered
rather
misty
by
an
unwonted
allowance
of
beer
;
*NL*
and
a
parish
surgeon
who
did
such
matters
by
contract
;
Oliver
and
*NL*
Nature
fought
out
the
point
between
them
.
The
result
was
,
that
,
after
*NL*
a
few
struggles
,
Oliver
breathed
,
sneezed
,
and
proceeded
to
advertise
*NL*
to
the
inmates
of
the
workhouse
the
fact
of
a
new
burden
having
been
*NL*
imposed
upon
the
parish
,
by
setting
up
as
loud
a
cry
as
could
*NL*
reasonably
have
been
expected
from
a
male
infant
who
had
not
been
*NL*
possessed
of
that
very
useful
appendage
,
a
voice
,
for
a
much
longer
*NL*
space
of
time
than
three
minutes
and
a
quarter
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
Oliver
gave
this
first
proof
of
the
free
and
proper
action
of
his
*NL*
lungs
,
the
patchwork
coverlet
which
was
carelessly
flung
over
the
iron
*NL*
bedstead
,
rustled
;
the
pale
face
of
a
young
woman
was
raised
feebly
*NL*
from
the
pillow
;
and
a
faint
voice
imperfectly
articulated
the
words
,
*NL*
`
Let
me
see
the
child
,
and
die
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
surgeon
had
been
sitting
with
his
face
turned
towards
the
fire
:
*NL*
giving
the
palms
of
his
hands
a
warm
and
a
rub
alternately
.
As
the
*NL*
young
woman
spoke
,
he
rose
,
and
advancing
to
the
bed
's
head
,
said
,
with
*NL*
more
kindness
than
might
have
been
expected
of
him
:
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
,
you
must
not
talk
about
dying
yet
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Lor
bless
her
dear
heart
,
no
!
'
interposed
the
nurse
,
hastily
*NL*
depositing
in
her
pocket
a
green
glass
bottle
,
the
contents
of
which
*NL*
she
had
been
tasting
in
a
corner
with
evident
satisfaction
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Lor
bless
her
dear
heart
,
when
she
has
lived
as
long
as
I
have
,
sir
,
*NL*
and
had
thirteen
children
of
her
own
,
and
all
on
'em
dead
except
two
,
*NL*
and
them
in
the
wurkus
with
me
,
she
'll
know
better
than
to
take
on
in
*NL*
that
way
,
bless
her
dear
heart
!
Think
what
it
is
to
be
a
mother
,
*NL*
there
's
a
dear
young
lamb
do
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Apparently
this
consolatory
perspective
of
a
mother
's
prospects
failed
*NL*
in
producing
its
due
effect
.
The
patient
shook
her
head
,
and
stretched
*NL*
out
her
hand
towards
the
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
surgeon
deposited
it
in
her
arms
.
She
imprinted
her
cold
white
*NL*
lips
passionately
on
its
forehead
;
passed
her
hands
over
her
face
;
*NL*
gazed
wildly
round
;
shuddered
;
fell
back
--
and
died
.
They
chafed
her
*NL*
breast
,
hands
,
and
temples
;
but
the
blood
had
stopped
forever
.
They
*NL*
talked
of
hope
and
comfort
.
They
had
been
strangers
too
long
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
's
all
over
,
Mrs.
Thingummy
!
'
said
the
surgeon
at
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ah
,
poor
dear
,
so
it
is
!
'
said
the
nurse
,
picking
up
the
cork
of
the
*NL*
green
bottle
,
which
had
fallen
out
on
the
pillow
,
as
she
stooped
to
*NL*
take
up
the
child
.
`
Poor
dear
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
need
n't
mind
sending
up
to
me
,
if
the
child
cries
,
nurse
,
'
said
*NL*
the
surgeon
,
putting
on
his
gloves
with
great
deliberation
.
`
It
's
very
*NL*
likely
it
_
will
_
be
troublesome
.
Give
it
a
little
gruel
if
it
is
.
'
He
*NL*
put
on
his
hat
,
and
,
pausing
by
the
bed-side
on
his
way
to
the
door
,
*NL*
added
,
`
She
was
a
good-looking
girl
,
too
;
where
did
she
come
from
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
She
was
brought
here
last
night
,
'
replied
the
old
woman
,
`
by
the
*NL*
overseer
's
order
.
She
was
found
lying
in
the
street
.
She
had
walked
*NL*
some
distance
,
for
her
shoes
were
worn
to
pieces
;
but
where
she
came
*NL*
from
,
or
where
she
was
going
to
,
nobody
knows
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
surgeon
leaned
over
the
body
,
and
raised
the
left
hand
.
`
The
old
*NL*
story
,
'
he
said
,
shaking
his
head
:
`
no
wedding-ring
,
I
see
.
Ah
!
*NL*
Good-night
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
medical
gentleman
walked
away
to
dinner
;
and
the
nurse
,
having
once
*NL*
more
applied
herself
to
the
green
bottle
,
sat
down
on
a
low
chair
*NL*
before
the
fire
,
and
proceeded
to
dress
the
infant
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
an
excellent
example
of
the
power
of
dress
,
young
Oliver
Twist
*NL*
was
!
Wrapped
in
the
blanket
which
had
hitherto
formed
his
only
*NL*
covering
,
he
might
have
been
the
child
of
a
nobleman
or
a
beggar
;
it
*NL*
would
have
been
hard
for
the
haughtiest
stranger
to
have
assigned
him
*NL*
his
proper
station
in
society
.
But
now
that
he
was
enveloped
in
the
*NL*
old
calico
robes
which
had
grown
yellow
in
the
same
service
,
he
was
*NL*
badged
and
ticketed
,
and
fell
into
his
place
at
once
--
a
parish
*NL*
child
--
the
orphan
of
a
workhouse
--
the
humble
,
half-starved
drudge
--
to
*NL*
be
cuffed
and
buffeted
through
the
world
--
despised
by
all
,
and
pitied
*NL*
by
none
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oliver
cried
lustily
.
If
he
could
have
known
that
he
was
an
orphan
,
*NL*
left
to
the
tender

CHAPTER
II
*NL*
*NL*
TREATS
OF
OLIVER
TWIST
'S
GROWTH
,
EDUCATION
,
AND
BOARD
*NL*
*NL*
For
the
next
eight
or
ten
months
,
Oliver
was
the
victim
of
a
systematic
*NL*
course
of
treachery
and
deception
.
He
was
brought
up
by
hand
.
The
*NL*
hungry
and
destitute
situation
of
the
infant
orphan
was
duly
reported
*NL*
by
the
workhouse
authorities
to
the
parish
authorities
.
The
parish
*NL*
authorities
inquired
with
dignity
of
the
workhouse
authorities
,
whether
*NL*
there
was
no
female
then
domiciled
in
`
the
house
'
who
was
in
a
*NL*
situation
to
impart
to
Oliver
Twist
,
the
consolation
and
nourishment
of
*NL*
which
he
stood
in
need
.
The
workhouse
authorities
replied
with
*NL*
humility
,
that
there
was
not
.
Upon
this
,
the
parish
authorities
*NL*
magnanimously
and
humanely
resolved
,
that
Oliver
should
be
`
farmed
,
'
*NL*
or
,
in
other
words
,
that
he
should
be
dispatched
to
a
branch-workhouse
*NL*
some
three
miles
off
,
where
twenty
or
thirty
other
juvenile
offenders
*NL*
against
the
poor-laws
,
rolled
about
the
floor
all
day
,
without
the
*NL*
inconvenience
of
too
much
food
or
too
much
clothing
,
under
the
parental
*NL*
superintendence
of
an
elderly
female
,
who
received
the
culprits
at
and
*NL*
for
the
consideration
of
sevenpence-halfpenny
per
small
head
per
week
.
*NL*
Sevenpence-halfpenny
's
worth
per
week
is
a
good
round
diet
for
a
child
;
*NL*
a
great
deal
may
be
got
for
sevenpence-halfpenny
,
quite
enough
to
*NL*
overload
its
stomach
,
and
make
it
uncomfortable
.
The
elderly
female
was
*NL*
a
woman
of
wisdom
and
experience
;
she
knew
what
was
good
for
children
;
*NL*
and
she
had
a
very
accurate
perception
of
what
was
good
for
herself
.
*NL*
So
,
she
appropriated
the
greater
part
of
the
weekly
stipend
to
her
own
*NL*
use
,
and
consigned
the
rising
parochial
generation
to
even
a
shorter
*NL*
allowance
than
was
originally
provided
for
them
.
Thereby
finding
in
*NL*
the
lowest
depth
a
deeper
still
;
and
proving
herself
a
very
great
*NL*
experimental
philosopher
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everybody
knows
the
story
of
another
experimental
philosopher
who
had
a
*NL*
great
theory
about
a
horse
being
able
to
live
without
eating
,
and
who
*NL*
demonstrated
it
so
well
,
that
he
had
got
his
own
horse
down
to
a
straw
*NL*
a
day
,
and
would
unquestionably
have
rendered
him
a
very
spirited
and
*NL*
rampacious
animal
on
nothing
at
all
,
if
he
had
not
died
,
*NL*
four-and-twenty
hours
before
he
was
to
have
had
his
first
comfortable
*NL*
bait
of
air
.
Unfortunately
for
,
the
experimental
philosophy
of
the
*NL*
female
to
whose
protecting
care
Oliver
Twist
was
delivered
over
,
a
*NL*
similar
result
usually
attended
the
operation
of
_
her
_
system
;
for
at
*NL*
the
very
moment
when
the
child
had
contrived
to
exist
upon
the
smallest
*NL*
possible
portion
of
the
weakest
possible
food
,
it
did
perversely
happen
*NL*
in
eight
and
a
half
cases
out
of
ten
,
either
that
it
sickened
from
want
*NL*
and
cold
,
or
fell
into
the
fire
from
neglect
,
or
got
half-smothered
by
*NL*
accident
;
in
any
one
of
which
cases
,
the
miserable
little
being
was
*NL*
usually
summoned
into
another
world
,
and
there
gathered
to
the
fathers
*NL*
it
had
never
known
in
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
Occasionally
,
when
there
was
some
more
than
usually
interesting
inquest
*NL*
upon
a
parish
child
who
had
been
overlooked
in
turning
up
a
bedstead
,
*NL*
or
inadvertently
scalded
to
death
when
there
happened
to
be
a
*NL*
washing
--
though
the
latter
accident
was
very
scarce
,
anything
*NL*
approaching
to
a
washing
being
of
rare
occurrence
in
the
farm
--
the
jury
*NL*
would
take
it
into
their
heads
to
ask
troublesome
questions
,
or
the
*NL*
parishioners
would
rebelliously
affix
their
signatures
to
a
*NL*
remonstrance
.
But
these
impertinences
were
speedily
checked
by
the
*NL*
evidence
of
the
surgeon
,
and
the
testimony
of
the
beadle
;
the
former
of
*NL*
whom
had
always
opened
the
body
and
found
nothing
inside
-LRB-
which
was
*NL*
very
probable
indeed
-RRB-
,
and
the
latter
of
whom
invariably
swore
whatever
*NL*
the
parish
wanted
;
which
was
very
self-devotional
.
Besides
,
the
board
*NL*
made
periodical
pilgrimages
to
the
farm
,
and
always
sent
the
beadle
the
*NL*
day
before
,
to
say
they
were
going
.
The
children
were
neat
and
clean
*NL*
to
behold
,
when
_
they
_
went
;
and
what
more
would
the
people
have
!
*NL*
*NL*
It
can
not
be
expected
that
this
system
of
farming
would
produce
any
*NL*
very
extraordinary
or
luxuriant
crop
.
Oliver
Twist
's
ninth
birthday
*NL*
found
him
a
pale
thin
child
,
somewhat
diminutive
in
stature
,
and
*NL*
decidedly
small
in
circumference
.
But
nature
or
inheritance
had
*NL*
implanted
a
good
sturdy
spirit
in
Oliver
's
breast
.
It
had
had
plenty
*NL*
of
room
to
expand
,
thanks
to
the
spare
diet
of
the
establishment
;
and
*NL*
perhaps
to
this
circumstance
may
be
attributed
his
having
any
ninth
*NL*
birth-day
at
all
.
Be
this
as
it
may
,
however
,
it
was
his
ninth
*NL*
birthday
;
and
he
was
keeping
it
in
the
coal-cellar
with
a
select
party
*NL*
of
two
other
young
gentleman
,
who
,
after
participating
with
him
in
a
*NL*
sound
thrashing
,
had
been
locked
up
for
atrociously
presuming
to
be
*NL*
hungry
,
when
Mrs.
Mann
,
the
good
lady
of
the
house
,
was
unexpectedly
*NL*
startled
by
the
apparition
of
Mr.
Bumble
,
the
beadle
,
striving
to
undo
*NL*
the
wicket
of
the
garden-gate
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Goodness
gracious
!
Is
that
you
,
Mr.
Bumble
,
sir
?
'
said
Mrs.
Mann
,
*NL*
thrusting
her
head
out
of
the
window
in
well-affected
ecstasies
of
joy
.
*NL*
'
-LRB-
Susan
,
take
Oliver
and
them
two
brats
upstairs
,
and
wash
'em
*NL*
directly
.
-RRB-
--
My
heart
alive
!
Mr.
Bumble
,
how
glad
I
am
to
see
you
,
*NL*
sure-ly
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
Mr.
Bumble
was
a
fat
man
,
and
a
choleric
;
so
,
instead
of
*NL*
responding
to
this
open-hearted
salutation
in
a
kindred
spirit
,
he
gave
*NL*
the
little
wicket
a
tremendous
shake
,
and
then
bestowed
upon
it
a
kick
*NL*
which
could
have
emanated
from
no
leg
but
a
beadle
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Lor
,
only
think
,
'
said
Mrs.
Mann
,
running
out
,
--
for
the
three
boys
had
*NL*
been
removed
by
this
time
,
--
`
only
think
of
that
!
That
I
should
have
*NL*
forgotten
that
the
gate
was
bolted
on
the
inside
,
on
account
of
them
*NL*
dear
children
!
Walk
in
sir
;
walk
in
,
pray
,
Mr.
Bumble
,
do
,
sir
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Although
this
invitation
was
accompanied
with
a
curtsey
that
might
have
*NL*
softened
the
heart
of
a
church-warden
,
it
by
no
means
mollified
the
*NL*
beadle
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Do
you
think
this
respectful
or
proper
conduct
,
Mrs.
Mann
,
'
inquired
*NL*
Mr.
Bumble
,
grasping
his
cane
,
`
to
keep
the
parish
officers
a
waiting
*NL*
at
your
garden-gate
,
when
they
come
here
upon
porochial
business
with
*NL*
the
porochial
orphans
?
Are
you
aweer
,
Mrs.
Mann
,
that
you
are
,
as
I
*NL*
may
say
,
a
porochial
delegate
,
and
a
stipendiary
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
'm
sure
Mr.
Bumble
,
that
I
was
only
a
telling
one
or
two
of
the
dear
*NL*
children
as
is
so
fond
of
you
,
that
it
was
you
a
coming
,
'
replied
Mrs.
*NL*
Mann
with
great
humility
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bumble
had
a
great
idea
of
his
oratorical
powers
and
his
*NL*
importance
.
He
had
displayed
the
one
,
and
vindicated
the
other
.
He
*NL*
relaxed
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
well
,
Mrs.
Mann
,
'
he
replied
in
a
calmer
tone
;
`
it
may
be
as
you
*NL*
say
;
it
may
be
.
Lead
the
way
in
,
Mrs.
Mann
,
for
I
come
on
business
,
*NL*
and
have
something
to
say
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Mann
ushered
the
beadle
into
a
small
parlour
with
a
brick
floor
;
*NL*
placed
a
seat
for
him
;
and
officiously
deposited
his
cocked
hat
and
*NL*
cane
on
the
table
before
him
.
Mr.
Bumble
wiped
from
his
forehead
the
*NL*
perspiration
which
his
walk
had
engendered
,
glanced
complacently
at
the
*NL*
cocked
hat
,
and
smiled
.
Yes
,
he
smiled
.
Beadles
are
but
men
:
and
Mr.
*NL*
Bumble
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Now
do
n't
you
be
offended
at
what
I
'm
a
going
to
say
,
'
observed
Mrs.
*NL*
Mann
,
with
captivating
sweetness
.
`
You
've
had
a
long
walk
,
you
know
,
*NL*
or
I
would
n't
mention
it
.
Now
,
will
you
take
a
little
drop
of
*NL*
somethink
,
Mr.
Bumble
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Not
a
drop
.
Nor
a
drop
,
'
said
Mr.
Bumble
,
waving
his
right
hand
in
a
*NL*
dignified
,
but
placid
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
think
you
will
,
'
said
Mrs.
Mann
,
who
had
noticed
the
tone
of
the
*NL*
refusal
,
and
the
gesture
that
had
accompanied
it
.
`
Just
a
leetle
drop
,
*NL*
with
a
little
cold
water
,
and
a
lump
of
sugar
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bumble
coughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Now
,
just
a
leetle
drop
,
'
said
Mrs.
Mann
persuasively
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
is
it
?
'
inquired
the
beadle
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
it
's
what
I
'm
obliged
to
keep
a
little
of
in
the
house
,
to
put
*NL*
into
the
blessed
infants
'
Daffy
,
when
they
ai
n't
well
,
Mr.
Bumble
,
'
*NL*
replied
Mrs.
Mann
as
she
opened
a
corner
cupboard
,
and
took
down
a
*NL*
bottle
and
glass
.
`
It
's
gin
.
I
'll
not
deceive
you
,
Mr.
B.
It
's
gin
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Do
you
give
the
children
Daffy
,
Mrs.
Mann
?
'
inquired
Bumble
,
following
*NL*
with
his
eyes
the
interesting
process
of
mixing
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ah
,
bless
'em
,
that
I
do
,
dear
as
it
is
,
'
replied
the
nurse
.
'
I
*NL*
could
n't
see
'em
suffer
before
my
very
eyes
,
you
know
sir
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
'
;
said
Mr.
Bumble
approvingly
;
`
no
,
you
could
not
.
You
are
a
*NL*
humane
woman
,
Mrs.
Mann
.
'
-LRB-
Here
she
set
down
the
glass
.
-RRB-
'
I
shall
*NL*
take
a
early
opportunity
of
mentioning
it
to
the
board
,
Mrs.
Mann
.
'
*NL*
-LRB-
He
drew
it
towards
him
.
-RRB-
`
You
feel
as
a
mother
,
Mrs.
Mann
.
'
-LRB-
He
*NL*
stirred
the
gin-and-water
.
-RRB-
`
I
--
I
drink
your
health
with
cheerfulness
,
*NL*
Mrs.
Mann
'
;
and
he
swallowed
half
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
now
about
business
,
'
said
the
beadle
,
taking
out
a
leathern
*NL*
pocket-book
.
`
The
child
that
was
half-baptized
Oliver
Twist
,
is
nine
*NL*
year
old
to-day
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Bless
him
!
'
interposed
Mrs.
Mann
,
inflaming
her
left
eye
with
the
*NL*
corner
of
her
apron
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
notwithstanding
a
offered
reward
of
ten
pound
,
which
was
*NL*
afterwards
increased
to
twenty
pound
.
Notwithstanding
the
most
*NL*
superlative
,
and
,
I
may
say
,
supernat
`
ral
exertions
on
the
part
of
this
*NL*
parish
,
'
said
Bumble
,
`
we
have
never
been
able
to
discover
who
is
his
*NL*
father
,
or
what
was
his
mother
's
settlement
,
name
,
or
condition
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Mann
raised
her
hands
in
astonishment
;
but
added
,
after
a
moment
's
*NL*
reflection
,
`
How
comes
he
to
have
any
name
at
all
,
then
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
beadle
drew
himself
up
with
great
pride
,
and
said
,
'
I
inwented
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
,
Mr.
Bumble
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
,
Mrs.
Mann
.
We
name
our
fondlings
in
alphabetical
order

The
last
*NL*
was
a
S
,
--
Swubble
,
I
named
him

This
was
a
T
,

Twist
,
I
named

him

*NL*
The
next
one
comes
will
be
Unwin
,
and
the
next
Vilkins

I
have
got
*NL*
names
ready
made
to
the
end
of
the
alphabet

all
the
way
through
it
*NL*
again
,
when
we
come
to
Z.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
you
're
quite
a
literary
character

sir
!
'
said
Mrs.
Mann
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
well
,

said
the
beadle
,
evidently
gratified
with
the
compliment
;
*NL*
`
perhaps
I
may
be
.
Perhaps
I
may
be
,
Mrs.
Mann
.
'
He
finished
the
*NL*
gin-and-water
,
and
added
,
`
Oliver
being
now
too
old
to
remain
here
,
the
*NL*
board
have
determined
to
have
him
back
into
the
house
.
I
have
come
out
*NL*
myself
to
take
him
there
.
So
let
me
see
him
at
once
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
'll
fetch
him
directly
,
'
said
Mrs.
Mann
,
leaving
the
room
for
that
*NL*
purpose
.
Oliver
,
having
had
by
this
time
as
much
of
the
outer
coat
of
*NL*
dirt
which
encrusted
his
face
and
hands
,
removed
,
as
could
be
scrubbed
*NL*
off
in
one
washing
,
was
led
into
the
room
by
his
benevolent
protectress
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Make
a
bow
to
the
gentleman
,
Oliver
,
'
said
Mrs.
Mann
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oliver
made
a
bow
,
which
was
divided
between
the
beadle
on
the
chair
,
*NL*
and
the
cocked
hat
on
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Will
you
go
along
with
me
,
Oliver
?
'
said
Mr.
Bumble
,
in
a
majestic
*NL*
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oliver
was
about
to
say
that
he
would
go
along
with
anybody
with
great
*NL*
readiness
,
when
,
glancing
upward
,
he
caught
sight
of
Mrs.
Mann
,
who
had
*NL*
got
behind
the
beadle
's
chair
,
and
was
shaking
her
fist
at
him
with
a
*NL*
furious
countenance
.
He
took
the
hint
at
once
,
for
the
fist
had
been
*NL*
too
often
impressed
upon
his
body
not
to
be
deeply
impressed
upon
his
*NL*
recollection
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Will
she
go
with
me
?
'
inquired
poor
Oliver
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
she
ca
n't
,
'
replied
Mr.
Bumble
.
`
But
she
'll
come
and
see
you
*NL*
sometimes
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
no
very
great
consolation
to
the
child
.
Young
as
he
was
,
*NL*
however
,
he
had
sense
enough
to
make
a
feint
of
feeling
great
regret
at
*NL*
going
away
.
It
was
no
very
difficult
matter
for
the
boy
to
call
tears
*NL*
into
his
eyes
.
Hunger
and
recent
ill-usage
are
great
assistants
if
you
*NL*
want
to
cry
;
and
Oliver
cried
very
naturally
indeed
.
Mrs.
Mann
gave
*NL*
him
a
thousand
embraces
,
and
what
Oliver
wanted
a
great
deal
more
,
a
*NL*
piece
of
bread
and
butter
,
less
he
should
seem
too
hungry
when
he
got
*NL*
to
the
workhouse
.
With
the
slice
of
bread
in
his
hand
,
and
the
little
*NL*
brown-cloth
parish
cap
on
his
head
,
Oliver
was
then
led
away
by
Mr.
*NL*
Bumble
from
the
wretched
home
where
one
kind
word
or
look
had
never
*NL*
lighted
the
gloom
of
his
infant
years
.
And
yet
he
burst
into
an
agony
*NL*
of
childish
grief
,
as
the
cottage-gate
closed
after
him
.
Wretched
as
*NL*
were
the
little
companions
in
misery
he
was
leaving
behind
,
they
were
*NL*
the
only
friends
he
had
ever
known
;
and
a
sense
of
his
loneliness
in
*NL*
the
great
wide
world
,
sank
into
the
child
's
heart
for
the
first
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bumble
walked
on
with
long
strides
;
little
Oliver
,
firmly
grasping
*NL*
his
gold-laced
cuff
,
trotted
beside
him
,
inquiring
at
the
end
of
every
*NL*
quarter
of
a
mile
whether
they
were
`
nearly
there
.
'
To
these
*NL*
interrogations
Mr.
Bumble
returned
very
brief
and
snappish
replies
;
for
*NL*
the
temporary
blandness
which
gin-and-water
awakens
in
some
bosoms
had
*NL*
by
this
time
evaporated
;
and
he
was
once
again
a
beadle
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oliver
had
not
been
within
the
walls
of
the
workhouse
a
quarter
of
an
*NL*
hour
,
and
had
scarcely
completed
the
demolition
of
a
second
slice
of
*NL*
bread
,
when
Mr.
Bumble
,
who
had
handed
him
over
to
the
care
of
an
old
*NL*
woman
,
returned
;
and
,
telling
him
it
was
a
board
night
,
informed
him
*NL*
that
the
board
had
said
he
was
to
appear
before
it
forthwith
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
having
a
very
clearly
defined
notion
of
what
a
live
board
was
,
*NL*
Oliver
was
rather
astounded
by
this
intelligence
,
and
was
not
quite
*NL*
certain
whether
he
ought
to
laugh
or
cry
.
He
had
no
time
to
think
*NL*
about
the
matter
,
however
;
for
Mr.
Bumble
gave
him
a
tap
on
the
head
,
*NL*
with
his
cane
,
to
wake
him
up
:
and
another
on
the
back
to
make
him
*NL*
lively
:
and
bidding
him
to
follow
,
conducted
him
into
a
large
*NL*
white-washed
room
,
where
eight
or
ten
fat
gentlemen
were
sitting
round
*NL*
a
table
.
At
the
top
of
the
table
,
seated
in
an
arm-chair
rather
higher
*NL*
than
the
rest
,
was
a
particularly
fat
gentleman
with
a
very
round
,
red
*NL*
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Bow
to
the
board
,
'
said
Bumble
.
Oliver
brushed
away
two
or
three
*NL*
tears
that
were
lingering
in
his
eyes
;
and
seeing
no
board
but
the
*NL*
table
,
fortunately
bowed
to
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
's
your
name
,
boy
?
'
said
the
gentleman
in
the
high
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oliver
was
frightened
at
the
sight
of
so
many
gentlemen
,
which
made
him
*NL*
tremble
:
and
the
beadle
gave
him
another
tap
behind
,
which
made
him
*NL*
cry
.
These
two
causes
made
him
answer
in
a
very
low
and
hesitating
*NL*
voice
;
whereupon
a
gentleman
in
a
white
waistcoat
said
he
was
a
fool
.
*NL*
Which
was
a
capital
way
of
raising
his
spirits
,
and
putting
him
quite
*NL*
at
his
ease
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Boy
,
'
said
the
gentleman
in
the
high
chair
,
`
listen
to
me
.
You
know
*NL*
you
're
an
orphan
,
I
suppose
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
's
that
,
sir
?
'
inquired
poor
Oliver
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
boy
_
is
_
a
fool
--
I
thought
he
was
,
'
said
the
gentleman
in
the
*NL*
white
waistcoat
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Hush
!
'
said
the
gentleman
who
had
spoken
first
.
`
You
know
you
've
got
*NL*
no
father
or
mother
,
and
that
you
were
brought
up
by
the
parish
,
do
n't
*NL*
you
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
sir
,
'
replied
Oliver
,
weeping
bitterly
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
are
you
crying
for
?
'
inquired
the
gentleman
in
the
white
*NL*
waistcoat
.
And
to
be
sure
it
was
very
extraordinary
.
What
_
could
_
the
*NL*
boy
be
crying
for
?
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
hope
you
say
your
prayers
every
night
,
'
said
another
gentleman
in
a
*NL*
gruff
voice
;
`
and
pray
for
the
people
who
feed
you
,
and
take
care
of
*NL*
you
--
like
a
Christian
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
sir
,
'
stammered
the
boy
.
The
gentleman
who
spoke
last
was
*NL*
unconsciously
right
.
It
would
have
been
very
like
a
Christian
,
and
a
*NL*
marvellously
good
Christian
too
,
if
Oliver
had
prayed
for
the
people
*NL*
who
fed
and
took
care
of
_
him
_
.
But
he
had
n't
,
because
nobody
had
*NL*
taught
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
!
You
have
come
here
to
be
educated
,
and
taught
a
useful
trade
,
'
*NL*
said
the
red-faced
gentleman
in
the
high
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
So
you
'll
begin
to
pick
oakum
to-morrow
morning
at
six
o'clock
,
'
added
*NL*
the
surly
one
in
the
white
waistcoat
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
the
combination
of
both
these
blessings
in
the
one
simple
process
*NL*
of
picking
oakum
,
Oliver
bowed
low
by
the
direction
of
the
beadle
,
and
*NL*
was
then
hurried
away
to
a
large
ward
;
where
,
on
a
rough
,
hard
bed
,
he
*NL*
sobbed
himself
to
sleep
.
What
a
novel
illustration
of
the
tender
laws
*NL*
of
England
!
They
let
the
paupers
go
to
sleep
!
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Oliver
!
He
little
thought
,
as
he
lay
sleeping
in
happy
*NL*
unconsciousness
of
all
around
him
,
that
the
board
had
that
very
day
*NL*
arrived
at
a
decision
which
would
exercise
the
most
material
influence
*NL*
over
all
his
future
fortunes
.
But
they
had
.
And
this
was
it
:
*NL*
*NL*
The
members
of
this
board
were
very
sage
,
deep
,
philosophical
men
;
and
*NL*
when
they
came
to
turn
their
attention
to
the
workhouse
,
they
found
out
*NL*
at
once
,
what
ordinary
folks
would
never
have
discovered
--
the
poor
*NL*
people
liked
it
!
It
was
a
regular
place
of
public
entertainment
for
*NL*
the
poorer
classes
;
a
tavern
where
there
was
nothing
to
pay
;
a
public
*NL*
breakfast
,
dinner
,
tea
,
and
supper
all
the
year
round
;
a
brick
and
*NL*
mortar
elysium
,
where
it
was
all
play
and
no
work
.
`
Oho
!
'
said
the
*NL*
board
,
looking
very
knowing
;
`
we
are
the
fellows
to
set
this
to
rights
;
*NL*
we
'll
stop
it
all
,
in
no
time
.
'
So
,
they
established
the
rule
,
that
*NL*
all
poor
people
should
have
the
alternative
-LRB-
for
they
would
compel
*NL*
nobody
,
not
they
-RRB-
,
of
being
starved
by
a
gradual
process
in
the
house
,
*NL*
or
by
a
quick
one
out
of
it
.
With
this
view
,
they
contracted
with
the
*NL*
water-works
to
lay
on
an
unlimited
supply
of
water
;
and
with
a
*NL*
corn-factor
to
supply
periodically
small
quantities
of
oatmeal
;
and
*NL*
issued
three
meals
of
thin
gruel
a
day
,
with
an
onion
twice
a
week
,
and
*NL*
half
a
roll
of
Sundays
.
They
made
a
great
many
other
wise
and
humane
*NL*
regulations
,
having
reference
to
the
ladies
,
which
it
is
not
necessary
*NL*
to
repeat
;
kindly
undertook
to
divorce
poor
married
people
,
in
*NL*
consequence
of
the
great
expense
of
a
suit
in
Doctors
'
Commons
;
and
,
*NL*
instead
of
compelling
a
man
to
support
his
family
,
as
they
had
*NL*
theretofore
done
,
took
his
family
away
from
him
,
and
made
him
a
*NL*
bachelor
!
There
is
no
saying
how
many
applicants
for
relief
,
under
*NL*
these
last
two
heads
,
might
have
started
up
in
all
classes
of
society
,
*NL*
if
it
had
not
been
coupled
with
the
workhouse
;
but
the
board
were
*NL*
long-headed
men
,
and
had
provided
for
this
difficulty
.
The
relief
was
*NL*
inseparable
from
the
workhouse
and
the
gruel
;
and
that
frightened
*NL*
people
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
the
first
six
months
after
Oliver
Twist
was
removed
,
the
system
was
*NL*
in
full
operation
.
It
was
rather
expensive
at
first
,
in
consequence
of
*NL*
the
increase
in
the
undertaker
's
bill
,
and
the
necessity
of
taking
in
*NL*
the
clothes
of
all
the
paupers
,
which
fluttered
loosely
on
their
*NL*
wasted
,
shrunken
forms
,
after
a
week
or
two
's
gruel
.
But
the
number
of
*NL*
workhouse
inmates
got
thin
as
well
as
the
paupers
;
and
the
board
were
*NL*
in
ecstasies
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
room
in
which
the
boys
were
fed
,
was
a
large
stone
hall
,
with
a
*NL*
copper
at
one
end
:
out
of
which
the
master
,
dressed
in
an
apron
for
the
*NL*
purpose
,
and
assisted
by
one
or
two
women
,
ladled
the
gruel
at
*NL*
mealtimes
.
Of
this
festive
composition
each
boy
had
one
porringer
,
and
*NL*
no
more
--
except
on
occasions
of
great
public
rejoicing
,
when
he
had
two
*NL*
ounces
and
a
quarter
of
bread
besides
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
bowls
never
wanted
washing
.
The
boys
polished
them
with
their
*NL*
spoons
till
they
shone
again
;
and
when
they
had
performed
this
*NL*
operation
-LRB-
which
never
took
very
long
,
the
spoons
being
nearly
as
large
*NL*
as
the
bowls
-RRB-
,
they
would
sit
staring
at
the
copper
,
with
such
eager
*NL*
eyes
,
as
if
they
could
have
devoured
the
very
bricks
of
which
it
was
*NL*
composed
;
employing
themselves
,
meanwhile
,
in
sucking
their
fingers
*NL*
most
assiduously
,
with
the
view
of
catching
up
any
stray
splashes
of
*NL*
gruel
that
might
have
been
cast
thereon
.
Boys
have
generally
excellent
*NL*
appetites
.
Oliver
Twist
and
his
companions
suffered
the
tortures
of
*NL*
slow
starvation
for
three
months
:
at
last
they
got
so
voracious
and
*NL*
wild
with
hunger
,
that
one
boy
,
who
was
tall
for
his
age
,
and
had
n't
*NL*
been
used
to
that
sort
of
thing
-LRB-
for
his
father
had
kept
a
small
*NL*
cook-shop
-RRB-
,
hinted
darkly
to
his
companions
,
that
unless
he
had
another
*NL*
basin
of
gruel
per
diem
,
he
was
afraid
he
might
some
night
happen
to
*NL*
eat
the
boy
who
slept
next
him
,
who
happened
to
be
a
weakly
youth
of
*NL*
tender
age
.
He
had
a
wild
,
hungry
eye
;
and
they
implicitly
believed
*NL*
him
.
A
council
was
held
;
lots
were
cast
who
should
walk
up
to
the
*NL*
master
after
supper
that
evening
,
and
ask
for
more
;
and
it
fell
to
*NL*
Oliver
Twist
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
evening
arrived
;
the
boys
took
their
places
.
The
master
,
in
his
*NL*
cook
's
uniform
,
stationed
himself
at
the
copper
;
his
pauper
assistants
*NL*
ranged
themselves
behind
him
;
the
gruel
was
served
out
;
and
a
long
*NL*
grace
was
said
over
the
short
commons
.
The
gruel
disappeared
;
the
boys
*NL*
whispered
each
other
,
and
winked
at
Oliver
;
while
his
next
neighbors
*NL*
nudged
him
.
Child
as
he
was
,
he
was
desperate
with
hunger
,
and
*NL*
reckless
with
misery
.
He
rose
from
the
table
;
and
advancing
to
the
*NL*
master
,
basin
and
spoon
in
hand
,
said
:
somewhat
alarmed
at
his
own
*NL*
temerity
:
*NL*
*NL*
`
Please
,
sir
,
I
want
some
more
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
master
was
a
fat
,
healthy
man
;
but
he
turned
very
pale
.
He
gazed
in
*NL*
stupefied
astonishment
on
the
small
rebel
for
some
seconds
,
and
then
*NL*
clung
for
support
to
the
copper
.
The
assistants
were
paralysed
with
*NL*
wonder
;
the
boys
with
fear
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
!
'
said
the
master
at
length
,
in
a
faint
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Please
,
sir
,
'
replied
Oliver
,
'
I
want
some
more
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
master
aimed
a
blow
at
Oliver
's
head
with
the
ladle
;
pinioned
him
*NL*
in
his
arm
;
and
shrieked
aloud
for
the
beadle
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
board
were
sitting
in
solemn
conclave
,
when
Mr.
Bumble
rushed
into
*NL*
the
room
in
great
excitement
,
and
addressing
the
gentleman
in
the
high
*NL*
chair
,
said
,
*NL*
*NL*
`
Mr.
Limbkins
,
I
beg
your
pardon
,
sir
!
Oliver
Twist
has
asked
for
*NL*
more
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
general
start
.
Horror
was
depicted
on
every
countenance
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
For
_
more
_
!
'
said
Mr.
Limbkins
.
`
Compose
yourself
,
Bumble
,
and
answer
*NL*
me
distinctly
.
Do
I
understand
that
he
asked
for
more
,
after
he
had
*NL*
eaten
the
supper
allotted
by
the
dietary
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
did
,
sir
,
'
replied
Bumble
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
boy
will
be
hung
,
'
said
the
gentleman
in
the
white
waistcoat
.
'
I
*NL*
know
that
boy
will
be
hung
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Nobody
controverted
the
prophetic
gentleman
's
opinion
.
An
animated
*NL*
discussion
took
place
.
Oliver
was
ordered
into
instant
confinement
;
*NL*
and
a
bill
was
next
morning
pasted
on
the
outside
of
the
gate
,
offering
*NL*
a
reward
of
five
pounds
to
anybody
who
would
take
Oliver
Twist
off
the
*NL*
hands
of
the
parish
.
In
other
words
,
five
pounds
and
Oliver
Twist
were
*NL*
offered
to
any
man
or
woman
who
wanted
an
apprentice
to
any
trade
,
*NL*
business
,
or
calling
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
never
was
more
convinced
of
anything
in
my
life
,
'
said
the
gentleman
*NL*
in
the
white
waistcoat
,
as
he
knocked
at
the
gate
and
read
the
bill
*NL*
next
morning
:
'
I
never
was
more
convinced
of
anything
in
my
life
,
than
*NL*
I
am
that
that
boy
will
come
to
be
hung
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
purpose
to
show
in
the
sequel
whether
the
white
waistcoated
*NL*
gentleman
was
right
or
not
,
I
should
perhaps
mar
the
interest
of
this
*NL*
narrative
-LRB-
supposing
it
to
possess
any
at
all
-RRB-
,
if
I
ventured
to
hint
*NL*
just
yet
,
whether
the
life
of
Oliver
Twist
had
this
violent
termination
*NL*
or
no
.

CHAPTER
III
*NL*
*NL*
RELATES
HOW
OLIVER
TWIST
WAS
VERY
NEAR
GETTING
A
PLACE
WHICH
WOULD
NOT
*NL*
HAVE
BEEN
A
SINECURE
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
week
after
the
commission
of
the
impious
and
profane
offence
of
*NL*
asking
for
more
,
Oliver
remained
a
close
prisoner
in
the
dark
and
*NL*
solitary
room
to
which
he
had
been
consigned
by
the
wisdom
and
mercy
of
*NL*
the
board
.
It
appears
,
at
first
sight
not
unreasonable
to
suppose
,
*NL*
that
,
if
he
had
entertained
a
becoming
feeling
of
respect
for
the
*NL*
prediction
of
the
gentleman
in
the
white
waistcoat
,
he
would
have
*NL*
established
that
sage
individual
's
prophetic
character
,
once
and
for
*NL*
ever
,
by
tying
one
end
of
his
pocket-handkerchief
to
a
hook
in
the
*NL*
wall
,
and
attaching
himself
to
the
other
.
To
the
performance
of
this
*NL*
feat
,
however
,
there
was
one
obstacle
:
namely
,
that
*NL*
pocket-handkerchiefs
being
decided
articles
of
luxury
,
had
been
,
for
*NL*
all
future
times
and
ages
,
removed
from
the
noses
of
paupers
by
the
*NL*
express
order
of
the
board
,
in
council
assembled
:
solemnly
given
and
*NL*
pronounced
under
their
hands
and
seals
.
There
was
a
still
greater
*NL*
obstacle
in
Oliver
's
youth
and
childishness
.
He
only
cried
bitterly
*NL*
all
day
;
and
,
when
the
long
,
dismal
night
came
on
,
spread
his
little
*NL*
hands
before
his
eyes
to
shut
out
the
darkness
,
and
crouching
in
the
*NL*
corner
,
tried
to
sleep
:
ever
and
anon
waking
with
a
start
and
tremble
,
*NL*
and
drawing
himself
closer
and
closer
to
the
wall
,
as
if
to
feel
even
*NL*
its
cold
hard
surface
were
a
protection
in
the
gloom
and
loneliness
*NL*
which
surrounded
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Let
it
not
be
supposed
by
the
enemies
of
`
the
system
,
'
that
,
during
the
*NL*
period
of
his
solitary
incarceration
,
Oliver
was
denied
the
benefit
of
*NL*
exercise
,
the
pleasure
of
society
,
or
the
advantages
of
religious
*NL*
consolation
.
As
for
exercise
,
it
was
nice
cold
weather
,
and
he
was
*NL*
allowed
to
perform
his
ablutions
every
morning
under
the
pump
,
in
a
*NL*
stone
yard
,
in
the
presence
of
Mr.
Bumble
,
who
prevented
his
catching
*NL*
cold
,
and
caused
a
tingling
sensation
to
pervade
his
frame
,
by
repeated
*NL*
applications
of
the
cane
.
As
for
society
,
he
was
carried
every
other
*NL*
day
into
the
hall
where
the
boys
dined
,
and
there
sociably
flogged
as
a
*NL*
public
warning
and
example
.
And
so
far
from
being
denied
the
*NL*
advantages
of
religious
consolation
,
he
was
kicked
into
the
same
*NL*
apartment
every
evening
at
prayer-time
,
and
there
permitted
to
listen
*NL*
to
,
and
console
his
mind
with
,
a
general
supplication
of
the
boys
,
*NL*
containing
a
special
clause
,
therein
inserted
by
authority
of
the
*NL*
board
,
in
which
they
entreated
to
be
made
good
,
virtuous
,
contented
,
*NL*
and
obedient
,
and
to
be
guarded
from
the
sins
and
vices
of
Oliver
*NL*
Twist
:
whom
the
supplication
distinctly
set
forth
to
be
under
the
*NL*
exclusive
patronage
and
protection
of
the
powers
of
wickedness
,
and
an
*NL*
article
direct
from
the
manufactory
of
the
very
Devil
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
chanced
one
morning
,
while
Oliver
's
affairs
were
in
this
auspicious
*NL*
and
comfortable
state
,
that
Mr.
Gamfield
,
chimney-sweep
,
went
his
way
*NL*
down
the
High
Street
,
deeply
cogitating
in
his
mind
his
ways
and
means
*NL*
of
paying
certain
arrears
of
rent
,
for
which
his
landlord
had
become
*NL*
rather
pressing
.
Mr.
Gamfield
's
most
sanguine
estimate
of
his
finances
*NL*
could
not
raise
them
within
full
five
pounds
of
the
desired
amount
;
*NL*
and
,
in
a
species
of
arithmetical
desperation
,
he
was
alternately
*NL*
cudgelling
his
brains
and
his
donkey
,
when
passing
the
workhouse
,
his
*NL*
eyes
encountered
the
bill
on
the
gate
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Wo
--
o
!
'
said
Mr.
Gamfield
to
the
donkey
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
donkey
was
in
a
state
of
profound
abstraction
:
wondering
,
probably
,
*NL*
whether
he
was
destined
to
be
regaled
with
a
cabbage-stalk
or
two
when
*NL*
he
had
disposed
of
the
two
sacks
of
soot
with
which
the
little
cart
was
*NL*
laden
;
so
,
without
noticing
the
word
of
command
,
he
jogged
onward
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Gamfield
growled
a
fierce
imprecation
on
the
donkey
generally
,
but
*NL*
more
particularly
on
his
eyes
;
and
,
running
after
him
,
bestowed
a
blow
*NL*
on
his
head
,
which
would
inevitably
have
beaten
in
any
skull
but
a
*NL*
donkey
's
.
Then
,
catching
hold
of
the
bridle
,
he
gave
his
jaw
a
sharp
*NL*
wrench
,
by
way
of
gentle
reminder
that
he
was
not
his
own
master
;
and
*NL*
by
these
means
turned
him
round
.
He
then
gave
him
another
blow
on
the
*NL*
head
,
just
to
stun
him
till
he
came
back
again
.
Having
completed
these
*NL*
arrangements
,
he
walked
up
to
the
gate
,
to
read
the
bill
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
gentleman
with
the
white
waistcoat
was
standing
at
the
gate
with
*NL*
his
hands
behind
him
,
after
having
delivered
himself
of
some
profound
*NL*
sentiments
in
the
board-room
.
Having
witnessed
the
little
dispute
*NL*
between
Mr.
Gamfield
and
the
donkey
,
he
smiled
joyously
when
that
*NL*
person
came
up
to
read
the
bill
,
for
he
saw
at
once
that
Mr.
Gamfield
*NL*
was
exactly
the
sort
of
master
Oliver
Twist
wanted
.
Mr.
Gamfield
*NL*
smiled
,
too
,
as
he
perused
the
document
;
for
five
pounds
was
just
the
*NL*
sum
he
had
been
wishing
for
;
and
,
as
to
the
boy
with
which
it
was
*NL*
encumbered
,
Mr.
Gamfield
,
knowing
what
the
dietary
of
the
workhouse
*NL*
was
,
well
knew
he
would
be
a
nice
small
pattern
,
just
the
very
thing
*NL*
for
register
stoves
.
So
,
he
spelt
the
bill
through
again
,
from
*NL*
beginning
to
end
;
and
then
,
touching
his
fur
cap
in
token
of
humility
,
*NL*
accosted
the
gentleman
in
the
white
waistcoat
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
This
here
boy
,
sir
,
wot
the
parish
wants
to
`
prentis
,
'
said
Mr.
*NL*
Gamfield
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ay
,
my
man
,
'
said
the
gentleman
in
the
white
waistcoat
,
with
a
*NL*
condescending
smile
.
`
What
of
him
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
If
the
parish
vould
like
him
to
learn
a
right
pleasant
trade
,
in
a
*NL*
good
`
spectable
chimbley-sweepin
'
bisness
,
'
said
Mr.
Gamfield
,
'
I
wants
*NL*
a
`
prentis
,
and
I
am
ready
to
take
him
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Walk
in
,
'
said
the
gentleman
in
the
white
waistcoat
.
Mr.
Gamfield
*NL*
having
lingered
behind
,
to
give
the
donkey
another
blow
on
the
head
,
*NL*
and
another
wrench
of
the
jaw
,
as
a
caution
not
to
run
away
in
his
*NL*
absence
,
followed
the
gentleman
with
the
white
waistcoat
into
the
room
*NL*
where
Oliver
had
first
seen
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
's
a
nasty
trade
,
'
said
Mr.
Limbkins
,
when
Gamfield
had
again
stated
*NL*
his
wish
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Young
boys
have
been
smothered
in
chimneys
before
now
,
'
said
another
*NL*
gentleman
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
's
acause
they
damped
the
straw
afore
they
lit
it
in
the
chimbley
*NL*
to
make
'em
come
down
again
,
'
said
Gamfield
;
`
that
's
all
smoke
,
and
no
*NL*
blaze
;
vereas
smoke
ai
n't
o
'
no
use
at
all
in
making
a
boy
come
down
,
*NL*
for
it
only
sinds
him
to
sleep
,
and
that
's
wot
he
likes
.
Boys
is
wery
*NL*
obstinit
,
and
wery
lazy
,
Gen
`
l'men
,
and
there
's
nothink
like
a
good
hot
*NL*
blaze
to
make
'em
come
down
vith
a
run
.
It
's
humane
too
,
gen
`
l'men
,
*NL*
acause
,
even
if
they
've
stuck
in
the
chimbley
,
roasting
their
feet
*NL*
makes
'em
struggle
to
hextricate
theirselves
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
gentleman
in
the
white
waistcoat
appeared
very
much
amused
by
this
*NL*
explanation
;
but
his
mirth
was
speedily
checked
by
a
look
from
Mr.
*NL*
Limbkins
.
The
board
then
proceeded
to
converse
among
themselves
for
a
*NL*
few
minutes
,
but
in
so
low
a
tone
,
that
the
words
`
saving
of
*NL*
expenditure
,
'
`
looked
well
in
the
accounts
,
'
`
have
a
printed
report
*NL*
published
,
'
were
alone
audible
.
These
only
chanced
to
be
heard
,
*NL*
indeed
,
or
account
of
their
being
very
frequently
repeated
with
great
*NL*
emphasis
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
the
whispering
ceased
;
and
the
members
of
the
board
,
having
*NL*
resumed
their
seats
and
their
solemnity
,
Mr.
Limbkins
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
`
We
have
considered
your
proposition
,
and
we
do
n't
approve
of
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Not
at
all
,
'
said
the
gentleman
in
the
white
waistcoat
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Decidedly
not
,
'
added
the
other
members
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
Mr.
Gamfield
did
happen
to
labour
under
the
slight
imputation
of
*NL*
having
bruised
three
or
four
boys
to
death
already
,
it
occurred
to
him
*NL*
that
the
board
had
,
perhaps
,
in
some
unaccountable
freak
,
taken
it
into
*NL*
their
heads
that
this
extraneous
circumstance
ought
to
influence
their
*NL*
proceedings
.
It
was
very
unlike
their
general
mode
of
doing
business
,
*NL*
if
they
had
;
but
still
,
as
he
had
no
particular
wish
to
revive
the
*NL*
rumour
,
he
twisted
his
cap
in
his
hands
,
and
walked
slowly
from
the
*NL*
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
So
you
wo
n't
let
me
have
him
,
gen
`
l'men
?
'
said
Mr.
Gamfield
,
pausing
*NL*
near
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
'
replied
Mr.
Limbkins
;
`
at
least
,
as
it
's
a
nasty
business
,
we
*NL*
think
you
ought
to
take
something
less
than
the
premium
we
offered
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Gamfield
's
countenance
brightened
,
as
,
with
a
quick
step
,
he
*NL*
returned
to
the
table
,
and
said
,
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
'll
you
give
,
gen
`
l'men
?
Come
!
Do
n't
be
too
hard
on
a
poor
man
.
*NL*
What
'll
you
give
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
should
say
,
three
pound
ten
was
plenty
,
'
said
Mr.
Limbkins
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ten
shillings
too
much
,
'
said
the
gentleman
in
the
white
waistcoat
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Come
!
'
said
Gamfield
;
`
say
four
pound
,
gen
`
l'men
.
Say
four
pound
,
and
*NL*
you
've
got
rid
of
him
for
good
and
all
.
There
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Three
pound
ten
,
'
repeated
Mr.
Limbkins
,
firmly
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Come
!
I
'll
split
the
diff
`
erence
,
gen
`
l'men
,
'
urged
Gamfield
.
`
Three
*NL*
pound
fifteen
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Not
a
farthing
more
,
'
was
the
firm
reply
of
Mr.
Limbkins
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
're
desperate
hard
upon
me
,
gen
`
l'men
,
'
said
Gamfield
,
wavering
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Pooh
!
pooh
!
nonsense
!
'
said
the
gentleman
in
the
white
waistcoat
.
*NL*
`
He
'd
be
cheap
with
nothing
at
all
,
as
a
premium
.
Take
him
,
you
silly
*NL*
fellow
!
He
's
just
the
boy
for
you
.
He
wants
the
stick
,
now
and
then
:
*NL*
it
'll
do
him
good
;
and
his
board
need
n't
come
very
expensive
,
for
he
*NL*
has
n't
been
overfed
since
he
was
born
.
Ha
!
ha
!
ha
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Gamfield
gave
an
arch
look
at
the
faces
round
the
table
,
and
,
*NL*
observing
a
smile
on
all
of
them
,
gradually
broke
into
a
smile
himself
.
*NL*
The
bargain
was
made
.
Mr.
Bumble
,
was
at
once
instructed
that
Oliver
*NL*
Twist
and
his
indentures
were
to
be
conveyed
before
the
magistrate
,
for
*NL*
signature
and
approval
,
that
very
afternoon
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
pursuance
of
this
determination
,
little
Oliver
,
to
his
excessive
*NL*
astonishment
,
was
released
from
bondage
,
and
ordered
to
put
himself
*NL*
into
a
clean
shirt
.
He
had
hardly
achieved
this
very
unusual
gymnastic
*NL*
performance
,
when
Mr.
Bumble
brought
him
,
with
his
own
hands
,
a
basin
*NL*
of
gruel
,
and
the
holiday
allowance
of
two
ounces
and
a
quarter
of
*NL*
bread
.
At
this
tremendous
sight
,
Oliver
began
to
cry
very
piteously
:
*NL*
thinking
,
not
unnaturally
,
that
the
board
must
have
determined
to
kill
*NL*
him
for
some
useful
purpose
,
or
they
never
would
have
begun
to
fatten
*NL*
him
up
in
that
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Do
n't
make
your
eyes
red
,
Oliver
,
but
eat
your
food
and
be
thankful
,
'
*NL*
said
Mr.
Bumble
,
in
a
tone
of
impressive
pomposity
.
`
You
're
a
going
to
*NL*
be
made
a
`
prentice
of
,
Oliver
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
A
prentice
,
sir
!
'
said
the
child
,
trembling
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
Oliver
,
'
said
Mr.
Bumble
.
`
The
kind
and
blessed
gentleman
which
*NL*
is
so
many
parents
to
you
,
Oliver
,
when
you
have
none
of
your
own
:
are
*NL*
a
going
to
`
prentice
'
you
:
and
to
set
you
up
in
life
,
and
make
a
man
of
*NL*
you
:
although
the
expense
to
the
parish
is
three
pound
ten
!
--
three
*NL*
pound
ten
,
Oliver
!
--
seventy
shillins
--
one
hundred
and
forty
*NL*
sixpences
!
--
and
all
for
a
naughty
orphan
which
nobody
ca
n't
love
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
As
Mr.
Bumble
paused
to
take
breath
,
after
delivering
this
address
in
*NL*
an
awful
voice
,
the
tears
rolled
down
the
poor
child
's
face
,
and
he
*NL*
sobbed
bitterly
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Come
,
'
said
Mr.
Bumble
,
somewhat
less
pompously
,
for
it
was
gratifying
*NL*
to
his
feelings
to
observe
the
effect
his
eloquence
had
produced
;
*NL*
`
Come
,
Oliver
!
Wipe
your
eyes
with
the
cuffs
of
your
jacket
,
and
do
n't
*NL*
cry
into
your
gruel
;
that
's
a
very
foolish
action
,
Oliver
.
'
It
*NL*
certainly
was
,
for
there
was
quite
enough
water
in
it
already
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
their
way
to
the
magistrate
,
Mr.
Bumble
instructed
Oliver
that
all
*NL*
he
would
have
to
do
,
would
be
to
look
very
happy
,
and
say
,
when
the
*NL*
gentleman
asked
him
if
he
wanted
to
be
apprenticed
,
that
he
should
like
*NL*
it
very
much
indeed
;
both
of
which
injunctions
Oliver
promised
to
obey
:
*NL*
the
rather
as
Mr.
Bumble
threw
in
a
gentle
hint
,
that
if
he
failed
in
*NL*
either
particular
,
there
was
no
telling
what
would
be
done
to
him
.
When
*NL*
they
arrived
at
the
office
,
he
was
shut
up
in
a
little
room
by
himself
,
*NL*
and
admonished
by
Mr.
Bumble
to
stay
there
,
until
he
came
back
to
fetch
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
the
boy
remained
,
with
a
palpitating
heart
,
for
half
an
hour
.
At
*NL*
the
expiration
of
which
time
Mr.
Bumble
thrust
in
his
head
,
unadorned
*NL*
with
the
cocked
hat
,
and
said
aloud
:
*NL*
*NL*
`
Now
,
Oliver
,
my
dear
,
come
to
the
gentleman
.
'
As
Mr.
Bumble
said
*NL*
this
,
he
put
on
a
grim
and
threatening
look
,
and
added
,
in
a
low
voice
,
*NL*
`
Mind
what
I
told
you
,
you
young
rascal
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Oliver
stared
innocently
in
Mr.
Bumble
's
face
at
this
somewhat
*NL*
contradictory
style
of
address
;
but
that
gentleman
prevented
his
*NL*
offering
any
remark
thereupon
,
by
leading
him
at
once
into
an
adjoining
*NL*
room
:
the
door
of
which
was
open
.
It
was
a
large
room
,
with
a
great
*NL*
window
.
Behind
a
desk
,
sat
two
old
gentleman
with
powdered
heads
:
one
*NL*
of
whom
was
reading
the
newspaper
;
while
the
other
was
perusing
,
with
*NL*
the
aid
of
a
pair
of
tortoise-shell
spectacles
,
a
small
piece
of
*NL*
parchment
which
lay
before
him
.
Mr.
Limbkins
was
standing
in
front
of
*NL*
the
desk
on
one
side
;
and
Mr.
Gamfield
,
with
a
partially
washed
face
,
*NL*
on
the
other
;
while
two
or
three
bluff-looking
men
,
in
top-boots
,
were
*NL*
lounging
about
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
gentleman
with
the
spectacles
gradually
dozed
off
,
over
the
*NL*
little
bit
of
parchment
;
and
there
was
a
short
pause
,
after
Oliver
had
*NL*
been
stationed
by
Mr.
Bumble
in
front
of
the
desk
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
This
is
the
boy
,
your
worship
,
'
said
Mr.
Bumble
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
gentleman
who
was
reading
the
newspaper
raised
his
head
for
a
*NL*
moment
,
and
pulled
the
other
old
gentleman
by
the
sleeve
;
whereupon
,
*NL*
the
last-mentioned
old
gentleman
woke
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
,
is
this
the
boy
?
'
said
the
old
gentleman
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
This
is
him
,
sir
,
'
replied
Mr.
Bumble
.
`
Bow
to
the
magistrate
,
my
*NL*
dear
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Oliver
roused
himself
,
and
made
his
best
obeisance
.
He
had
been
*NL*
wondering
,
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
magistrates
'
powder
,
whether
all
*NL*
boards
were
born
with
that
white
stuff
on
their
heads
,
and
were
boards
*NL*
from
thenceforth
on
that
account
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
'
said
the
old
gentleman
,
'
I
suppose
he
's
fond
of
*NL*
chimney-sweeping
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
doats
on
it
,
your
worship
,
'
replied
Bumble
;
giving
Oliver
a
sly
*NL*
pinch
,
to
intimate
that
he
had
better
not
say
he
did
n't
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
he
_
will
_
be
a
sweep
,
will
he
?
'
inquired
the
old
gentleman
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
If
we
was
to
bind
him
to
any
other
trade
to-morrow
,
he
'd
run
away
*NL*
simultaneous
,
your
worship
,
'
replied
Bumble
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
this
man
that
's
to
be
his
master
--
you
,
sir
--
you
'll
treat
him
well
,
*NL*
and
feed
him
,
and
do
all
that
sort
of
thing
,
will
you
?
'
said
the
old
*NL*
gentleman
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
When
I
says
I
will
,
I
means
I
will
,
'
replied
Mr.
Gamfield
doggedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
're
a
rough
speaker
,
my
friend
,
but
you
look
an
honest
,
*NL*
open-hearted
man
,
'
said
the
old
gentleman
:
turning
his
spectacles
in
*NL*
the
direction
of
the
candidate
for
Oliver
's
premium
,
whose
villainous
*NL*
countenance
was
a
regular
stamped
receipt
for
cruelty
.
But
the
*NL*
magistrate
was
half
blind
and
half
childish
,
so
he
could
n't
reasonably
*NL*
be
expected
to
discern
what
other
people
did
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
hope
I
am
,
sir
,
'
said
Mr.
Gamfield
,
with
an
ugly
leer
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
have
no
doubt
you
are
,
my
friend
,
'
replied
the
old
gentleman
:
fixing
*NL*
his
spectacles
more
firmly
on
his
nose
,
and
looking
about
him
for
the
*NL*
inkstand
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
critical
moment
of
Oliver
's
fate
.
If
the
inkstand
had
been
*NL*
where
the
old
gentleman
thought
it
was
,
he
would
have
dipped
his
pen
*NL*
into
it
,
and
signed
the
indentures
,
and
Oliver
would
have
been
*NL*
straightway
hurried
off
.
But
,
as
it
chanced
to
be
immediately
under
*NL*
his
nose
,
it
followed
,
as
a
matter
of
course
,
that
he
looked
all
over
*NL*
his
desk
for
it
,
without
finding
it
;
and
happening
in
the
course
of
his
*NL*
search
to
look
straight
before
him
,
his
gaze
encountered
the
pale
and
*NL*
terrified
face
of
Oliver
Twist
:
who
,
despite
all
the
admonitory
looks
*NL*
and
pinches
of
Bumble
,
was
regarding
the
repulsive
countenance
of
his
*NL*
future
master
,
with
a
mingled
expression
of
horror
and
fear
,
too
*NL*
palpable
to
be
mistaken
,
even
by
a
half-blind
magistrate
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
gentleman
stopped
,
laid
down
his
pen
,
and
looked
from
Oliver
to
*NL*
Mr.
Limbkins
;
who
attempted
to
take
snuff
with
a
cheerful
and
*NL*
unconcerned
aspect
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
My
boy
!
'
said
the
old
gentleman
,
`
you
look
pale
and
alarmed
.
What
is
*NL*
the
matter
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Stand
a
little
away
from
him
,
Beadle
,
'
said
the
other
magistrate
:
*NL*
laying
aside
the
paper
,
and
leaning
forward
with
an
expression
of
*NL*
interest
.
`
Now
,
boy
,
tell
us
what
's
the
matter
:
do
n't
be
afraid
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Oliver
fell
on
his
knees
,
and
clasping
his
hands
together
,
prayed
that
*NL*
they
would
order
him
back
to
the
dark
room
--
that
they
would
starve
*NL*
him
--
beat
him
--
kill
him
if
they
pleased
--
rather
than
send
him
away
with
*NL*
that
dreadful
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
!
'
said
Mr.
Bumble
,
raising
his
hands
and
eyes
with
most
*NL*
impressive
solemnity
.
`
Well
!
of
all
the
artful
and
designing
orphans
*NL*
that
ever
I
see
,
Oliver
,
you
are
one
of
the
most
bare-facedest
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Hold
your
tongue
,
Beadle
,
'
said
the
second
old
gentleman
,
when
Mr.
*NL*
Bumble
had
given
vent
to
this
compound
adjective
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
beg
your
worship
's
pardon
,
'
said
Mr.
Bumble
,
incredulous
of
having
*NL*
heard
aright
.
`
Did
your
worship
speak
to
me
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
.
Hold
your
tongue
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bumble
was
stupefied
with
astonishment
.
A
beadle
ordered
to
hold
*NL*
his
tongue
!
A
moral
revolution
!
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
gentleman
in
the
tortoise-shell
spectacles
looked
at
his
*NL*
companion
,
he
nodded
significantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
We
refuse
to
sanction
these
indentures
,
'
said
the
old
gentleman
:
*NL*
tossing
aside
the
piece
of
parchment
as
he
spoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
hope
,
'
stammered
Mr.
Limbkins
:
'
I
hope
the
magistrates
will
not
*NL*
form
the
opinion
that
the
authorities
have
been
guilty
of
any
improper
*NL*
conduct
,
on
the
unsupported
testimony
of
a
child
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
magistrates
are
not
called
upon
to
pronounce
any
opinion
on
the
*NL*
matter
,
'
said
the
second
old
gentleman
sharply
.
`
Take
the
boy
back
to
*NL*
the
workhouse
,
and
treat
him
kindly
.
He
seems
to
want
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
That
same
evening
,
the
gentleman
in
the
white
waistcoat
most
positively
*NL*
and
decidedly
affirmed
,
not
only
that
Oliver
would
be
hung
,
but
that
he
*NL*
would
be
drawn
and
quartered
into
the
bargain
.
Mr.
Bumble
shook
his
*NL*
head
with
gloomy
mystery
,
and
said
he
wished
he
might
come
to
good
;
*NL*
whereunto
Mr.
Gamfield
replied
,
that
he
wished
he
might
come
to
him
;
*NL*
which
,
although
he
agreed
with
the
beadle
in
most
matters
,
would
seem
*NL*
to
be
a
wish
of
a
totally
opposite
description
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
morning
,
the
public
were
once
informed
that
Oliver
Twist
was
*NL*
again
To
Let
,
and
that
five
pounds
would
be
paid
to
anybody
who
would
*NL*
take
possession
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
IV
*NL*
*NL*
OLIVER
,
BEING
OFFERED
ANOTHER
PLACE
,
MAKES
HIS
FIRST
ENTRY
INTO
PUBLIC
*NL*
LIFE
*NL*
*NL*
In
great
families
,
when
an
advantageous
place
can
not
be
obtained
,
*NL*
either
in
possession
,
reversion
,
remainder
,
or
expectancy
,
for
the
*NL*
young
man
who
is
growing
up
,
it
is
a
very
general
custom
to
send
him
to
*NL*
sea
.
The
board
,
in
imitation
of
so
wise
and
salutary
an
example
,
took
*NL*
counsel
together
on
the
expediency
of
shipping
off
Oliver
Twist
,
in
*NL*
some
small
trading
vessel
bound
to
a
good
unhealthy
port
.
This
*NL*
suggested
itself
as
the
very
best
thing
that
could
possibly
be
done
*NL*
with
him
:
the
probability
being
,
that
the
skipper
would
flog
him
to
*NL*
death
,
in
a
playful
mood
,
some
day
after
dinner
,
or
would
knock
his
*NL*
brains
out
with
an
iron
bar
;
both
pastimes
being
,
as
is
pretty
*NL*
generally
known
,
very
favourite
and
common
recreations
among
gentleman
*NL*
of
that
class
.
The
more
the
case
presented
itself
to
the
board
,
in
*NL*
this
point
of
view
,
the
more
manifold
the
advantages
of
the
step
*NL*
appeared
;
so
,
they
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
only
way
of
*NL*
providing
for
Oliver
effectually
,
was
to
send
him
to
sea
without
delay
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bumble
had
been
despatched
to
make
various
preliminary
inquiries
,
*NL*
with
the
view
of
finding
out
some
captain
or
other
who
wanted
a
*NL*
cabin-boy
without
any
friends
;
and
was
returning
to
the
workhouse
to
*NL*
communicate
the
result
of
his
mission
;
when
he
encountered
at
the
gate
,
*NL*
no
less
a
person
than
Mr.
Sowerberry
,
the
parochial
undertaker
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Sowerberry
was
a
tall
gaunt
,
large-jointed
man
,
attired
in
a
suit
*NL*
of
threadbare
black
,
with
darned
cotton
stockings
of
the
same
colour
,
*NL*
and
shoes
to
answer
.
His
features
were
not
naturally
intended
to
wear
*NL*
a
smiling
aspect
,
but
he
was
in
general
rather
given
to
professional
*NL*
jocosity
.
His
step
was
elastic
,
and
his
face
betokened
inward
*NL*
pleasantry
,
as
he
advanced
to
Mr.
Bumble
,
and
shook
him
cordially
by
*NL*
the
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
have
taken
the
measure
of
the
two
women
that
died
last
night
,
Mr.
*NL*
Bumble
,
'
said
the
undertaker
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
'll
make
your
fortune
,
Mr.
Sowerberry
,
'
said
the
beadle
,
as
he
*NL*
thrust
his
thumb
and
forefinger
into
the
proffered
snuff-box
of
the
*NL*
undertaker
:
which
was
an
ingenious
little
model
of
a
patent
coffin
.
'
I
*NL*
say
you
'll
make
your
fortune
,
Mr.
Sowerberry
,
'
repeated
Mr.
Bumble
,
*NL*
tapping
the
undertaker
on
the
shoulder
,
in
a
friendly
manner
,
with
his
*NL*
cane
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Think
so
?
'
said
the
undertaker
in
a
tone
which
half
admitted
and
half
*NL*
disputed
the
probability
of
the
event
.
`
The
prices
allowed
by
the
*NL*
board
are
very
small
,
Mr.
Bumble
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
So
are
the
coffins
,
'
replied
the
beadle
:
with
precisely
as
near
an
*NL*
approach
to
a
laugh
as
a
great
official
ought
to
indulge
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Sowerberry
was
much
tickled
at
this
:
as
of
course
he
ought
to
be
;
*NL*
and
laughed
a
long
time
without
cessation
.
`
Well
,
well
,
Mr.
Bumble
,
'
*NL*
he
said
at
length
,
`
there
's
no
denying
that
,
since
the
new
system
of
*NL*
feeding
has
come
in
,
the
coffins
are
something
narrower
and
more
*NL*
shallow
than
they
used
to
be
;
but
we
must
have
some
profit
,
Mr.
Bumble
.
*NL*
Well-seasoned
timber
is
an
expensive
article
,
sir
;
and
all
the
iron
*NL*
handles
come
,
by
canal
,
from
Birmingham
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
well
,
'
said
Mr.
Bumble
,
`
every
trade
has
its
drawbacks
.
A
fair
*NL*
profit
is
,
of
course
,
allowable
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Of
course
,
of
course
,
'
replied
the
undertaker
;
`
and
if
I
do
n't
get
a
*NL*
profit
upon
this
or
that
particular
article
,
why
,
I
make
it
up
in
the
*NL*
long-run
,
you
see
--
he
!
he
!
he
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Just
so
,
'
said
Mr.
Bumble
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Though
I
must
say
,
'
continued
the
undertaker
,
resuming
the
current
of
*NL*
observations
which
the
beadle
had
interrupted
:
`
though
I
must
say
,
Mr.
*NL*
Bumble
,
that
I
have
to
contend
against
one
very
great
disadvantage
:
*NL*
which
is
,
that
all
the
stout
people
go
off
the
quickest
.
The
people
*NL*
who
have
been
better
off
,
and
have
paid
rates
for
many
years
,
are
the
*NL*
first
to
sink
when
they
come
into
the
house
;
and
let
me
tell
you
,
Mr.
*NL*
Bumble
,
that
three
or
four
inches
over
one
's
calculation
makes
a
great
*NL*
hole
in
one
's
profits
:
especially
when
one
has
a
family
to
provide
for
,
*NL*
sir
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
As
Mr.
Sowerberry
said
this
,
with
the
becoming
indignation
of
an
*NL*
ill-used
man
;
and
as
Mr.
Bumble
felt
that
it
rather
tended
to
convey
a
*NL*
reflection
on
the
honour
of
the
parish
;
the
latter
gentleman
thought
it
*NL*
advisable
to
change
the
subject
.
Oliver
Twist
being
uppermost
in
his
*NL*
mind
,
he
made
him
his
theme
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
By
the
bye
,
'
said
Mr.
Bumble
,
`
you
do
n't
know
anybody
who
wants
a
boy
,
*NL*
do
you
?
A
porochial
`
prentis
,
who
is
at
present
a
dead-weight
;
a
*NL*
millstone
,
as
I
may
say
,
round
the
porochial
throat
?
Liberal
terms
,
*NL*
Mr.
Sowerberry
,
liberal
terms
?
'
As
Mr.
Bumble
spoke
,
he
raised
his
*NL*
cane
to
the
bill
above
him
,
and
gave
three
distinct
raps
upon
the
words
*NL*
`
five
pounds
'
:
which
were
printed
thereon
in
Roman
capitals
of
*NL*
gigantic
size
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Gadso
!
'
said
the
undertaker
:
taking
Mr.
Bumble
by
the
gilt-edged
*NL*
lappel
of
his
official
coat
;
`
that
's
just
the
very
thing
I
wanted
to
*NL*
speak
to
you
about
.
You
know
--
dear
me
,
what
a
very
elegant
button
this
*NL*
is
,
Mr.
Bumble
!
I
never
noticed
it
before
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
I
think
it
rather
pretty
,
'
said
the
beadle
,
glancing
proudly
*NL*
downwards
at
the
large
brass
buttons
which
embellished
his
coat
.
`
The
*NL*
die
is
the
same
as
the
porochial
seal
--
the
Good
Samaritan
healing
the
*NL*
sick
and
bruised
man
.
The
board
presented
it
to
me
on
Newyear
's
*NL*
morning
,
Mr.
Sowerberry
.
I
put
it
on
,
I
remember
,
for
the
first
time
,
*NL*
to
attend
the
inquest
on
that
reduced
tradesman
,
who
died
in
a
doorway
*NL*
at
midnight
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
recollect
,
'
said
the
undertaker
.
`
The
jury
brought
it
in
,
``
Died
from
*NL*
exposure
to
the
cold
,
and
want
of
the
common
necessaries
of
life
,
''
*NL*
did
n't
they
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bumble
nodded
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
they
made
it
a
special
verdict
,
I
think
,
'
said
the
undertaker
,
`
by
*NL*
adding
some
words
to
the
effect
,
that
if
the
relieving
officer
had
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Tush
!
Foolery
!
'
interposed
the
beadle
.
`
If
the
board
attended
to
all
*NL*
the
nonsense
that
ignorant
jurymen
talk
,
they
'd
have
enough
to
do
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Very
true
,
'
said
the
undertaker
;
`
they
would
indeed
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Juries
,
'
said
Mr.
Bumble
,
grasping
his
cane
tightly
,
as
was
his
wont
*NL*
when
working
into
a
passion
:
`
juries
is
ineddicated
,
vulgar
,
grovelling
*NL*
wretches
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
So
they
are
,
'
said
the
undertaker
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
They
have
n't
no
more
philosophy
nor
political
economy
about
'em
than
*NL*
that
,
'
said
the
beadle
,
snapping
his
fingers
contemptuously
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
more
they
have
,
'
acquiesced
the
undertaker
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
despise
'em
,
'
said
the
beadle
,
growing
very
red
in
the
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
So
do
I
,
'
rejoined
the
undertaker
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
I
only
wish
we
'd
a
jury
of
the
independent
sort
,
in
the
house
for
*NL*
a
week
or
two
,
'
said
the
beadle
;
`
the
rules
and
regulations
of
the
*NL*
board
would
soon
bring
their
spirit
down
for
'em
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Let
'em
alone
for
that
,
'
replied
the
undertaker
.
So
saying
,
he
*NL*
smiled
,
approvingly
:
to
calm
the
rising
wrath
of
the
indignant
parish
*NL*
officer
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Bumble
lifted
off
his
cocked
hat
;
took
a
handkerchief
from
the
*NL*
inside
of
the
crown
;
wiped
from
his
forehead
the
perspiration
which
his
*NL*
rage
had
engendered
;
fixed
the
cocked
hat
on
again
;
and
,
turning
to
the
*NL*
undertaker
,
said
in
a
calmer
voice
:
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
;
what
about
the
boy
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
!
'
replied
the
undertaker
;
`
why
,
you
know
,
Mr.
Bumble
,
I
pay
a
good
*NL*
deal
towards
the
poor
's
rates
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Hem
!
'
said
Mr.
Bumble
.
`
Well
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
'
replied
the
undertaker
,
'
I
was
thinking
that
if
I
pay
so
much
*NL*
towards
'em
,
I
've
a
right
to
get
as
much
out
of
'em
as
I
can
,
Mr.
*NL*
Bumble
;
and
so
--
I
think
I
'll
take
the
boy
myself
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bumble
grasped
the
undertaker
by
the
arm
,
and
led
him
into
the
*NL*
building
.
Mr.
Sowerberry
was
closeted
with
the
board
for
five
minutes
;
*NL*
and
it
was
arranged
that
Oliver
should
go
to
him
that
evening
`
upon
*NL*
liking
'
--
a
phrase
which
means
,
in
the
case
of
a
parish
apprentice
,
that
*NL*
if
the
master
find
,
upon
a
short
trial
,
that
he
can
get
enough
work
out
*NL*
of
a
boy
without
putting
too
much
food
into
him
,
he
shall
have
him
for
*NL*
a
term
of
years
,
to
do
what
he
likes
with
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
little
Oliver
was
taken
before
`
the
gentlemen
'
that
evening
;
and
*NL*
informed
that
he
was
to
go
,
that
night
,
as
general
house-lad
to
a
*NL*
coffin-maker
's
;
and
that
if
he
complained
of
his
situation
,
or
ever
*NL*
came
back
to
the
parish
again
,
he
would
be
sent
to
sea
,
there
to
be
*NL*
drowned
,
or
knocked
on
the
head
,
as
the
case
might
be
,
he
evinced
so
*NL*
little
emotion
,
that
they
by
common
consent
pronounced
him
a
hardened
*NL*
young
rascal
,
and
ordered
Mr.
Bumble
to
remove
him
forthwith
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
although
it
was
very
natural
that
the
board
,
of
all
people
in
the
*NL*
world
,
should
feel
in
a
great
state
of
virtuous
astonishment
and
horror
*NL*
at
the
smallest
tokens
of
want
of
feeling
on
the
part
of
anybody
,
they
*NL*
were
rather
out
,
in
this
particular
instance
.
The
simple
fact
was
,
*NL*
that
Oliver
,
instead
of
possessing
too
little
feeling
,
possessed
rather
*NL*
too
much
;
and
was
in
a
fair
way
of
being
reduced
,
for
life
,
to
a
state
*NL*
of
brutal
stupidity
and
sullenness
by
the
ill
usage
he
had
received
.
*NL*
He
heard
the
news
of
his
destination
,
in
perfect
silence
;
and
,
having
*NL*
had
his
luggage
put
into
his
hand
--
which
was
not
very
difficult
to
*NL*
carry
,
inasmuch
as
it
was
all
comprised
within
the
limits
of
a
brown
*NL*
paper
parcel
,
about
half
a
foot
square
by
three
inches
deep
--
he
pulled
*NL*
his
cap
over
his
eyes
;
and
once
more
attaching
himself
to
Mr.
Bumble
's
*NL*
coat
cuff
,
was
led
away
by
that
dignitary
to
a
new
scene
of
suffering
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
some
time
,
Mr.
Bumble
drew
Oliver
along
,
without
notice
or
remark
;
*NL*
for
the
beadle
carried
his
head
very
erect
,
as
a
beadle
always
should
:
*NL*
and
,
it
being
a
windy
day
,
little
Oliver
was
completely
enshrouded
by
*NL*
the
skirts
of
Mr.
Bumble
's
coat
as
they
blew
open
,
and
disclosed
to
*NL*
great
advantage
his
flapped
waistcoat
and
drab
plush
knee-breeches
.
As
*NL*
they
drew
near
to
their
destination
,
however
,
Mr.
Bumble
thought
it
*NL*
expedient
to
look
down
,
and
see
that
the
boy
was
in
good
order
for
*NL*
inspection
by
his
new
master
:
which
he
accordingly
did
,
with
a
fit
and
*NL*
becoming
air
of
gracious
patronage
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oliver
!
'
said
Mr.
Bumble
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
sir
,
'
replied
Oliver
,
in
a
low
,
tremulous
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Pull
that
cap
off
your
eyes
,
and
hold
up
your
head
,
sir
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Although
Oliver
did
as
he
was
desired
,
at
once
;
and
passed
the
back
of
*NL*
his
unoccupied
hand
briskly
across
his
eyes
,
he
left
a
tear
in
them
*NL*
when
he
looked
up
at
his
conductor
.
As
Mr.
Bumble
gazed
sternly
upon
*NL*
him
,
it
rolled
down
his
cheek
.
It
was
followed
by
another
,
and
another
.
*NL*
The
child
made
a
strong
effort
,
but
it
was
an
unsuccessful
one
.
*NL*
Withdrawing
his
other
hand
from
Mr.
Bumble
's
he
covered
his
face
with
*NL*
both
;
and
wept
until
the
tears
sprung
out
from
between
his
chin
and
*NL*
bony
fingers
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
!
'
exclaimed
Mr.
Bumble
,
stopping
short
,
and
darting
at
his
little
*NL*
charge
a
look
of
intense
malignity
.
`
Well
!
Of
_
all
_
the
*NL*
ungratefullest
,
and
worst-disposed
boys
as
ever
I
see
,
Oliver
,
you
are
*NL*
the
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
no
,
sir
,
'
sobbed
Oliver
,
clinging
to
the
hand
which
held
the
*NL*
well-known
cane
;
`
no
,
no
,
sir
;
I
will
be
good
indeed
;
indeed
,
indeed
I
*NL*
will
,
sir
!
I
am
a
very
little
boy
,
sir
;
and
it
is
so
--
so
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
So
what
?
'
inquired
Mr.
Bumble
in
amazement
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
So
lonely
,
sir
!
So
very
lonely
!
'
cried
the
child
.
`
Everybody
hates
*NL*
me
.
Oh
!
sir
,
do
n't
,
do
n't
pray
be
cross
to
me
!
'
The
child
beat
his
*NL*
hand
upon
his
heart
;
and
looked
in
his
companion
's
face
,
with
tears
of
*NL*
real
agony
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bumble
regarded
Oliver
's
piteous
and
helpless
look
,
with
some
*NL*
astonishment
,
for
a
few
seconds
;
hemmed
three
or
four
times
in
a
husky
*NL*
manner
;
and
after
muttering
something
about
`
that
troublesome
cough
,
'
*NL*
bade
Oliver
dry
his
eyes
and
be
a
good
boy
.
Then
once
more
taking
his
*NL*
hand
,
he
walked
on
with
him
in
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
undertaker
,
who
had
just
put
up
the
shutters
of
his
shop
,
was
*NL*
making
some
entries
in
his
day-book
by
the
light
of
a
most
appropriate
*NL*
dismal
candle
,
when
Mr.
Bumble
entered
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Aha
!
'
said
the
undertaker
;
looking
up
from
the
book
,
and
pausing
in
*NL*
the
middle
of
a
word
;
`
is
that
you
,
Bumble
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
one
else
,
Mr.
Sowerberry
,
'
replied
the
beadle
.
`
Here
!
I
've
brought
*NL*
the
boy
.
'
Oliver
made
a
bow
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
!
that
's
the
boy
,
is
it
?
'
said
the
undertaker
:
raising
the
candle
*NL*
above
his
head
,
to
get
a
better
view
of
Oliver
.
`
Mrs.
Sowerberry
,
will
*NL*
you
have
the
goodness
to
come
here
a
moment
,
my
dear
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Sowerberry
emerged
from
a
little
room
behind
the
shop
,
and
*NL*
presented
the
form
of
a
short
,
then
,
squeezed-up
woman
,
with
a
vixenish
*NL*
countenance
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
My
dear
,
'
said
Mr.
Sowerberry
,
deferentially
,
`
this
is
the
boy
from
*NL*
the
workhouse
that
I
told
you
of
.
'
Oliver
bowed
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Dear
me
!
'
said
the
undertaker
's
wife
,
`
he
's
very
small
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
he
_
is
_
rather
small
,
'
replied
Mr.
Bumble
:
looking
at
Oliver
as
*NL*
if
it
were
his
fault
that
he
was
no
bigger
;
`
he
is
small
.
There
's
no
*NL*
denying
it
.
But
he
'll
grow
,
Mrs.
Sowerberry
--
he
'll
grow
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ah
!
I
dare
say
he
will
,
'
replied
the
lady
pettishly
,
`
on
our
victuals
*NL*
and
our
drink
.
I
see
no
saving
in
parish
children
,
not
I
;
for
they
*NL*
always
cost
more
to
keep
,
than
they
're
worth
.
However
,
men
always
think
*NL*
they
know
best
.
There
!
Get
downstairs
,
little
bag
o

bones
.
'
With
*NL*
this
,
the
undertaker
's
wife
opened
a
side
door
,
and
pushed
Oliver
down
*NL*
a
steep
flight
of
stairs
into
a
stone
cell
,
damp
and
dark
:
forming
the
*NL*
ante-room
to
the
coal-cellar
,
and
denominated
`
kitchen
'
;
wherein
sat
a
*NL*
slatternly
girl
,
in
shoes
down
at
heel
,
and
blue
worsted
stockings
very
*NL*
much
out
of
repair
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Here
,
Charlotte
,
'
said
Mr.
Sowerberry
,
who
had
followed
Oliver
down
,
*NL*
`
give
this
boy
some
of
the
cold
bits
that
were
put
by
for
Trip
.
He
*NL*
has
n't
come
home
since
the
morning
,
so
he
may
go
without
'em
.
I
dare
*NL*
say
the
boy
is
n't
too
dainty
to
eat
'em
--
are
you
,
boy
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
Oliver
,
whose
eyes
had
glistened
at
the
mention
of
meat
,
and
who
was
*NL*
trembling
with
eagerness
to
devour
it
,
replied
in
the
negative
;
and
a
*NL*
plateful
of
coarse
broken
victuals
was
set
before
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
wish
some
well-fed
philosopher
,
whose
meat
and
drink
turn
to
gall
*NL*
within
him
;
whose
blood
is
ice
,
whose
heart
is
iron
;
could
have
seen
*NL*
Oliver
Twist
clutching
at
the
dainty
viands
that
the
dog
had
neglected
.
*NL*
I
wish
he
could
have
witnessed
the
horrible
avidity
with
which
Oliver
*NL*
tore
the
bits
asunder
with
all
the
ferocity
of
famine
.
There
is
only
*NL*
one
thing
I
should
like
better
;
and
that
would
be
to
see
the
*NL*
Philosopher
making
the
same
sort
of
meal
himself
,
with
the
same
relish
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
'
said
the
undertaker
's
wife
,
when
Oliver
had
finished
his
*NL*
supper
:
which
she
had
regarded
in
silent
horror
,
and
with
fearful
*NL*
auguries
of
his
future
appetite
:
`
have
you
done
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
There
being
nothing
eatable
within
his
reach
,
Oliver
replied
in
the
*NL*
affirmative
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Then
come
with
me
,
'
said
Mrs.
Sowerberry
:
taking
up
a
dim
and
dirty
*NL*
lamp
,
and
leading
the
way
upstairs
;
`
your
bed
's
under
the
counter
.
You
*NL*
do
n't
mind
sleeping
among
the
coffins
,
I
suppose
?
But
it
does
n't
much
*NL*
matter
whether
you
do
or
do
n't
,
for
you
ca
n't
sleep
anywhere
else
.
*NL*
Come
;
do
n't
keep
me
here
all
night
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Oliver
lingered
no
longer
,
but
meekly
followed
his
new
mistress
.

CHAPTER
V
*NL*
*NL*
OLIVER
MINGLES
WITH
NEW
ASSOCIATES
.
GOING
TO
A
FUNERAL
FOR
THE
FIRST
*NL*
TIME
,
HE
FORMS
AN
UNFAVOURABLE
NOTION
OF
HIS
MASTER
'S
BUSINESS
*NL*
*NL*
Oliver
,
being
left
to
himself
in
the
undertaker
's
shop
,
set
the
lamp
*NL*
down
on
a
workman
's
bench
,
and
gazed
timidly
about
him
with
a
feeling
*NL*
of
awe
and
dread
,
which
many
people
a
good
deal
older
than
he
will
be
*NL*
at
no
loss
to
understand
.
An
unfinished
coffin
on
black
tressels
,
*NL*
which
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
shop
,
looked
so
gloomy
and
death-like
*NL*
that
a
cold
tremble
came
over
him
,
every
time
his
eyes
wandered
in
the
*NL*
direction
of
the
dismal
object
:
from
which
he
almost
expected
to
see
*NL*
some
frightful
form
slowly
rear
its
head
,
to
drive
him
mad
with
terror
.
*NL*
Against
the
wall
were
ranged
,
in
regular
array
,
a
long
row
of
elm
*NL*
boards
cut
in
the
same
shape
:
looking
in
the
dim
light
,
like
*NL*
high-shouldered
ghosts
with
their
hands
in
their
breeches
pockets
.
*NL*
Coffin-plates
,
elm-chips
,
bright-headed
nails
,
and
shreds
of
black
*NL*
cloth
,
lay
scattered
on
the
floor
;
and
the
wall
behind
the
counter
was
*NL*
ornamented
with
a
lively
representation
of
two
mutes
in
very
stiff
*NL*
neckcloths
,
on
duty
at
a
large
private
door
,
with
a
hearse
drawn
by
*NL*
four
black
steeds
,
approaching
in
the
distance
.
The
shop
was
close
and
*NL*
hot
.
The
atmosphere
seemed
tainted
with
the
smell
of
coffins
.
The
*NL*
recess
beneath
the
counter
in
which
his
flock
mattress
was
thrust
,
*NL*
looked
like
a
grave
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nor
were
these
the
only
dismal
feelings
which
depressed
Oliver
.
He
was
*NL*
alone
in
a
strange
place
;
and
we
all
know
how
chilled
and
desolate
the
*NL*
best
of
us
will
sometimes
feel
in
such
a
situation
.
The
boy
had
no
*NL*
friends
to
care
for
,
or
to
care
for
him
.
The
regret
of
no
recent
*NL*
separation
was
fresh
in
his
mind
;
the
absence
of
no
loved
and
*NL*
well-remembered
face
sank
heavily
into
his
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
his
heart
was
heavy
,
notwithstanding
;
and
he
wished
,
as
he
crept
*NL*
into
his
narrow
bed
,
that
that
were
his
coffin
,
and
that
he
could
be
*NL*
lain
in
a
calm
and
lasting
sleep
in
the
churchyard
ground
,
with
the
*NL*
tall
grass
waving
gently
above
his
head
,
and
the
sound
of
the
old
deep
*NL*
bell
to
soothe
him
in
his
sleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oliver
was
awakened
in
the
morning
,
by
a
loud
kicking
at
the
outside
of
*NL*
the
shop-door
:
which
,
before
he
could
huddle
on
his
clothes
,
was
*NL*
repeated
,
in
an
angry
and
impetuous
manner
,
about
twenty-five
times
.
*NL*
When
he
began
to
undo
the
chain
,
the
legs
desisted
,
and
a
voice
began
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Open
the
door
,
will
yer
?
'
cried
the
voice
which
belonged
to
the
legs
*NL*
which
had
kicked
at
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
will
,
directly
,
sir
,
'
replied
Oliver
:
undoing
the
chain
,
and
turning
*NL*
the
key
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
suppose
yer
the
new
boy
,
ai
n't
yer
?
'
said
the
voice
through
the
*NL*
key-hole
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
sir
,
'
replied
Oliver
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
How
old
are
yer
?
'
inquired
the
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ten
,
sir
,
'
replied
Oliver
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Then
I
'll
whop
yer
when
I
get
in
,
'
said
the
voice
;
`
you
just
see
if
I
*NL*
do
n't
,
that
's
all
,
my
work
`
us
brat
!
'
and
having
made
this
obliging
*NL*
promise
,
the
voice
began
to
whistle
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oliver
had
been
too
often
subjected
to
the
process
to
which
the
very
*NL*
expressive
monosyllable
just
recorded
bears
reference
,
to
entertain
the
*NL*
smallest
doubt
that
the
owner
of
the
voice
,
whoever
he
might
be
,
would
*NL*
redeem
his
pledge
,
most
honourably
.
He
drew
back
the
bolts
with
a
*NL*
trembling
hand
,
and
opened
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
second
or
two
,
Oliver
glanced
up
the
street
,
and
down
the
street
,
*NL*
and
over
the
way
:
impressed
with
the
belief
that
the
unknown
,
who
had
*NL*
addressed
him
through
the
key-hole
,
had
walked
a
few
paces
off
,
to
warm
*NL*
himself
;
for
nobody
did
he
see
but
a
big
charity-boy
,
sitting
on
a
post
*NL*
in
front
of
the
house
,
eating
a
slice
of
bread
and
butter
:
which
he
cut
*NL*
into
wedges
,
the
size
of
his
mouth
,
with
a
clasp-knife
,
and
then
*NL*
consumed
with
great
dexterity
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
beg
your
pardon
,
sir
,
'
said
Oliver
at
length
:
seeing
that
no
other
*NL*
visitor
made
his
appearance
;
`
did
you
knock
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
kicked
,
'
replied
the
charity-boy
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Did
you
want
a
coffin
,
sir
?
'
inquired
Oliver
,
innocently
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
,
the
charity-boy
looked
monstrous
fierce
;
and
said
that
Oliver
*NL*
would
want
one
before
long
,
if
he
cut
jokes
with
his
superiors
in
that
*NL*
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yer
do
n't
know
who
I
am
,
I
suppose
,
Work
`
us
?
'
said
the
charity-boy
,
in
*NL*
continuation
:
descending
from
the
top
of
the
post
,
meanwhile
,
with
*NL*
edifying
gravity
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
sir
,
'
rejoined
Oliver
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
'm
Mister
Noah
Claypole
,
'
said
the
charity-boy
,
`
and
you
're
under
me
.
*NL*
Take
down
the
shutters
,
yer
idle
young
ruffian
!
'
With
this
,
Mr.
*NL*
Claypole
administered
a
kick
to
Oliver
,
and
entered
the
shop
with
a
*NL*
dignified
air
,
which
did
him
great
credit
.
It
is
difficult
for
a
*NL*
large-headed
,
small-eyed
youth
,
of
lumbering
make
and
heavy
*NL*
countenance
,
to
look
dignified
under
any
circumstances
;
but
it
is
more
*NL*
especially
so
,
when
superadded
to
these
personal
attractions
are
a
red
*NL*
nose
and
yellow
smalls
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oliver
,
having
taken
down
the
shutters
,
and
broken
a
pane
of
glass
in
*NL*
his
effort
to
stagger
away
beneath
the
weight
of
the
first
one
to
a
*NL*
small
court
at
the
side
of
the
house
in
which
they
were
kept
during
the
*NL*
day
,
was
graciously
assisted
by
Noah
:
who
having
consoled
him
with
the
*NL*
assurance
that
`
he
'd
catch
it
,
'
condescended
to
help
him
.
Mr.
*NL*
Sowerberry
came
down
soon
after
.
Shortly
afterwards
,
Mrs.
Sowerberry
*NL*
appeared
.
Oliver
having
`
caught
it
,
'
in
fulfilment
of
Noah
's
*NL*
prediction
,
followed
that
young
gentleman
down
the
stairs
to
breakfast
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Come
near
the
fire
,
Noah
,
'
said
Charlotte
.
'
I
saved
a
nice
little
bit
*NL*
of
bacon
for
you
from
master
's
breakfast
.
Oliver
,
shut
that
door
at
*NL*
Mister
Noah
's
back
,
and
take
them
bits
that
I
've
put
out
on
the
cover
*NL*
of
the
bread-pan
.
There
's
your
tea
;
take
it
away
to
that
box
,
and
*NL*
drink
it
there
,
and
make
haste
,
for
they
'll
want
you
to
mind
the
shop
.
*NL*
D'ye
hear
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'D
`
ye
hear
,
Work
`
us
?
'
said
Noah
Claypole
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Lor
,
Noah
!
'
said
Charlotte
,
`
what
a
rum
creature
you
are
!
Why
do
n't
*NL*
you
let
the
boy
alone
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Let
him
alone
!
'
said
Noah
.
`
Why
everybody
lets
him
alone
enough
,
for
*NL*
the
matter
of
that
.
Neither
his
father
nor
his
mother
will
ever
*NL*
interfere
with
him
.
All
his
relations
let
him
have
his
own
way
pretty
*NL*
well
.
Eh
,
Charlotte
?
He
!
he
!
he
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
,
you
queer
soul
!
'
said
Charlotte
,
bursting
into
a
hearty
laugh
,
in
*NL*
which
she
was
joined
by
Noah
;
after
which
they
both
looked
scornfully
*NL*
at
poor
Oliver
Twist
,
as
he
sat
shivering
on
the
box
in
the
coldest
*NL*
corner
of
the
room
,
and
ate
the
stale
pieces
which
had
been
specially
*NL*
reserved
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Noah
was
a
charity-boy
,
but
not
a
workhouse
orphan
.
No
chance-child
*NL*
was
he
,
for
he
could
trace
his
genealogy
all
the
way
back
to
his
*NL*
parents
,
who
lived
hard
by
;
his
mother
being
a
washerwoman
,
and
his
*NL*
father
a
drunken
soldier
,
discharged
with
a
wooden
leg
,
and
a
diurnal
*NL*
pension
of
twopence-halfpenny
and
an
unstateable
fraction
.
The
*NL*
shop-boys
in
the
neighbourhood
had
long
been
in
the
habit
of
branding
*NL*
Noah
in
the
public
streets
,
with
the
ignominious
epithets
of
*NL*
`
leathers
,
'
`
charity
,
'
and
the
like
;
and
Noah
had
bourne
them
without
*NL*
reply
.
But
,
now
that
fortune
had
cast
in
his
way
a
nameless
orphan
,
at
*NL*
whom
even
the
meanest
could
point
the
finger
of
scorn
,
he
retorted
on
*NL*
him
with
interest
.
This
affords
charming
food
for
contemplation
.
It
*NL*
shows
us
what
a
beautiful
thing
human
nature
may
be
made
to
be
;
and
how
*NL*
impartially
the
same
amiable
qualities
are
developed
in
the
finest
lord
*NL*
and
the
dirtiest
charity-boy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oliver
had
been
sojourning
at
the
undertaker
's
some
three
weeks
or
a
*NL*
month
.
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Sowerberry
--
the
shop
being
shut
up
--
were
taking
*NL*
their
supper
in
the
little
back-parlour
,
when
Mr.
Sowerberry
,
after
*NL*
several
deferential
glances
at
his
wife
,
said
,
*NL*
*NL*
`
My
dear
--
'
He
was
going
to
say
more
;
but
,
Mrs.
Sowerberry
looking
up
,
*NL*
with
a
peculiarly
unpropitious
aspect
,
he
stopped
short
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
'
said
Mrs.
Sowerberry
,
sharply
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Nothing
,
my
dear
,
nothing
,
'
said
Mr.
Sowerberry
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ugh
,
you
brute
!
'
said
Mrs.
Sowerberry
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Not
at
all
,
my
dear
,
'
said
Mr.
Sowerberry
humbly
.
'
I
thought
you
*NL*
did
n't
want
to
hear
,
my
dear
.
I
was
only
going
to
say
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
,
do
n't
tell
me
what
you
were
going
to
say
,
'
interposed
Mrs.
*NL*
Sowerberry
.
'
I
am
nobody
;
do
n't
consult
me
,
pray
.
_
I
_
do
n't
want
to
*NL*
intrude
upon
your
secrets
.
'
As
Mrs.
Sowerberry
said
this
,
she
gave
an
*NL*
hysterical
laugh
,
which
threatened
violent
consequences
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
,
my
dear
,
'
said
Sowerberry
,
'
I
want
to
ask
your
advice
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
no
,
do
n't
ask
mine
,
'
replied
Mrs.
Sowerberry
,
in
an
affecting
*NL*
manner
:
`
ask
somebody
else
's
.
'
Here
,
there
was
another
hysterical
*NL*
laugh
,
which
frightened
Mr.
Sowerberry
very
much
.
This
is
a
very
*NL*
common
and
much-approved
matrimonial
course
of
treatment
,
which
is
*NL*
often
very
effective
.
It
at
once
reduced
Mr.
Sowerberry
to
begging
,
as
*NL*
a
special
favour
,
to
be
allowed
to
say
what
Mrs.
Sowerberry
was
most
*NL*
curious
to
hear
.
After
a
short
duration
,
the
permission
was
most
*NL*
graciously
conceded
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
's
only
about
young
Twist
,
my
dear
,
'
said
Mr.
Sowerberry
.
'
A
very
*NL*
good-looking
boy
,
that
,
my
dear
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
need
be
,
for
he
eats
enough
,
'
observed
the
lady
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
There
's
an
expression
of
melancholy
in
his
face
,
my
dear
,
'
resumed
Mr.
*NL*
Sowerberry
,
`
which
is
very
interesting
.
He
would
make
a
delightful
*NL*
mute
,
my
love
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Sowerberry
looked
up
with
an
expression
of
considerable
*NL*
wonderment
.
Mr.
Sowerberry
remarked
it
and
,
without
allowing
time
for
*NL*
any
observation
on
the
good
lady
's
part
,
proceeded
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
do
n't
mean
a
regular
mute
to
attend
grown-up
people
,
my
dear
,
but
*NL*
only
for
children
's
practice
.
It
would
be
very
new
to
have
a
mute
in
*NL*
proportion
,
my
dear
.
You
may
depend
upon
it
,
it
would
have
a
superb
*NL*
effect
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Sowerberry
,
who
had
a
good
deal
of
taste
in
the
undertaking
way
,
*NL*
was
much
struck
by
the
novelty
of
this
idea
;
but
,
as
it
would
have
been
*NL*
compromising
her
dignity
to
have
said
so
,
under
existing
circumstances
,
*NL*
she
merely
inquired
,
with
much
sharpness
,
why
such
an
obvious
*NL*
suggestion
had
not
presented
itself
to
her
husband
's
mind
before
?
Mr.
*NL*
Sowerberry
rightly
construed
this
,
as
an
acquiescence
in
his
*NL*
proposition
;
it
was
speedily
determined
,
therefore
,
that
Oliver
should
*NL*
be
at
once
initiated
into
the
mysteries
of
the
trade
;
and
,
with
this
*NL*
view
,
that
he
should
accompany
his
master
on
the
very
next
occasion
of
*NL*
his
services
being
required
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
occasion
was
not
long
in
coming
.
Half
an
hour
after
breakfast
next
*NL*
morning
,
Mr.
Bumble
entered
the
shop
;
and
supporting
his
cane
against
*NL*
the
counter
,
drew
forth
his
large
leathern
pocket-book
:
from
which
he
*NL*
selected
a
small
scrap
of
paper
,
which
he
handed
over
to
Sowerberry
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Aha
!
'
said
the
undertaker
,
glancing
over
it
with
a
lively
countenance
;
*NL*
`
an
order
for
a
coffin
,
eh
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
For
a
coffin
first
,
and
a
porochial
funeral
afterwards
,
'
replied
Mr.
*NL*
Bumble
,
fastening
the
strap
of
the
leathern
pocket-book
:
which
,
like
*NL*
himself
,
was
very
corpulent
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Bayton
,
'
said
the
undertaker
,
looking
from
the
scrap
of
paper
to
Mr.
*NL*
Bumble
.
'
I
never
heard
the
name
before
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Bumble
shook
his
head
,
as
he
replied
,
`
Obstinate
people
,
Mr.
*NL*
Sowerberry
;
very
obstinate
.
Proud
,
too
,
I
'm
afraid
,
sir
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Proud
,
eh
?
'
exclaimed
Mr.
Sowerberry
with
a
sneer
.
`
Come
,
that
's
too
*NL*
much
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
,
it
's
sickening
,
'
replied
the
beadle
.
`
Antimonial
,
Mr.
Sowerberry
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
So
it
is
,
'
acquiesced
the
undertaker
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
We
only
heard
of
the
family
the
night
before
last
,
'
said
the
beadle
;
*NL*
`
and
we
should
n't
have
known
anything
about
them
,
then
,
only
a
woman
*NL*
who
lodges
in
the
same
house
made
an
application
to
the
porochial
*NL*
committee
for
them
to
send
the
porochial
surgeon
to
see
a
woman
as
was
*NL*
very
bad
.
He
had
gone
out
to
dinner
;
but
his
`
prentice
-LRB-
which
is
a
*NL*
very
clever
lad
-RRB-
sent
'em
some
medicine
in
a
blacking-bottle
,
offhand
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ah
,
there
's
promptness
,
'
said
the
undertaker
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Promptness
,
indeed
!
'
replied
the
beadle
.
`
But
what
's
the
consequence
;
*NL*
what
's
the
ungrateful
behaviour
of
these
rebels
,
sir
?
Why
,
the
husband
*NL*
sends
back
word
that
the
medicine
wo
n't
suit
his
wife
's
complaint
,
and
*NL*
so
she
sha
n't
take
it
--
says
she
sha
n't
take
it
,
sir
!
Good
,
strong
,
*NL*
wholesome
medicine
,
as
was
given
with
great
success
to
two
Irish
*NL*
labourers
and
a
coal-heaver
,
only
a
week
before
--
sent
'em
for
nothing
,
*NL*
with
a
blackin
'
-
bottle
in
,
--
and
he
sends
back
word
that
she
sha
n't
take
*NL*
it
,
sir
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
atrocity
presented
itself
to
Mr.
Bumble
's
mind
in
full
force
,
he
*NL*
struck
the
counter
sharply
with
his
cane
,
and
became
flushed
with
*NL*
indignation
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
'
said
the
undertaker
,
'
I
ne
--
ver
--
did
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Never
did
,
sir
!
'
ejaculated
the
beadle
.
`
No
,
nor
nobody
never
did
;
*NL*
but
now
she
's
dead
,
we
've
got
to
bury
her
;
and
that
's
the
direction
;
*NL*
and
the
sooner
it
's
done
,
the
better
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
saying
,
Mr.
Bumble
put
on
his
cocked
hat
wrong
side
first
,
in
a
*NL*
fever
of
parochial
excitement
;
and
flounced
out
of
the
shop
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
he
was
so
angry
,
Oliver
,
that
he
forgot
even
to
ask
after
you
!
'
*NL*
said
Mr.
Sowerberry
,
looking
after
the
beadle
as
he
strode
down
the
*NL*
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
sir
,
'
replied
Oliver
,
who
had
carefully
kept
himself
out
of
*NL*
sight
,
during
the
interview
;
and
who
was
shaking
from
head
to
foot
at
*NL*
the
mere
recollection
of
the
sound
of
Mr.
Bumble
's
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
need
n't
haven
taken
the
trouble
to
shrink
from
Mr.
Bumble
's
glance
,
*NL*
however
;
for
that
functionary
,
on
whom
the
prediction
of
the
gentleman
*NL*
in
the
white
waistcoat
had
made
a
very
strong
impression
,
thought
that
*NL*
now
the
undertaker
had
got
Oliver
upon
trial
the
subject
was
better
*NL*
avoided
,
until
such
time
as
he
should
be
firmly
bound
for
seven
years
,
*NL*
and
all
danger
of
his
being
returned
upon
the
hands
of
the
parish
*NL*
should
be
thus
effectually
and
legally
overcome
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
'
said
Mr.
Sowerberry
,
taking
up
his
hat
,
`
the
sooner
this
job
is
*NL*
done
,
the
better
.
Noah
,
look
after
the
shop
.
Oliver
,
put
on
your
cap
,
*NL*
and
come
with
me
.
'
Oliver
obeyed
,
and
followed
his
master
on
his
*NL*
professional
mission
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
walked
on
,
for
some
time
,
through
the
most
crowded
and
densely
*NL*
inhabited
part
of
the
town
;
and
then
,
striking
down
a
narrow
street
*NL*
more
dirty
and
miserable
than
any
they
had
yet
passed
through
,
paused
*NL*
to
look
for
the
house
which
was
the
object
of
their
search
.
The
houses
*NL*
on
either
side
were
high
and
large
,
but
very
old
,
and
tenanted
by
*NL*
people
of
the
poorest
class
:
as
their
neglected
appearance
would
have
*NL*
sufficiently
denoted
,
without
the
concurrent
testimony
afforded
by
the
*NL*
squalid
looks
of
the
few
men
and
women
who
,
with
folded
arms
and
bodies
*NL*
half
doubled
,
occasionally
skulked
along
.
A
great
many
of
the
*NL*
tenements
had
shop-fronts
;
but
these
were
fast
closed
,
and
mouldering
*NL*
away
;
only
the
upper
rooms
being
inhabited
.
Some
houses
which
had
*NL*
become
insecure
from
age
and
decay
,
were
prevented
from
falling
into
*NL*
the
street
,
by
huge
beams
of
wood
reared
against
the
walls
,
and
firmly
*NL*
planted
in
the
road
;
but
even
these
crazy
dens
seemed
to
have
been
*NL*
selected
as
the
nightly
haunts
of
some
houseless
wretches
,
for
many
of
*NL*
the
rough
boards
which
supplied
the
place
of
door
and
window
,
were
*NL*
wrenched
from
their
positions
,
to
afford
an
aperture
wide
enough
for
*NL*
the
passage
of
a
human
body
.
The
kennel
was
stagnant
and
filthy
.
The
*NL*
very
rats
,
which
here
and
there
lay
putrefying
in
its
rottenness
,
were
*NL*
hideous
with
famine
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
neither
knocker
nor
bell-handle
at
the
open
door
where
Oliver
*NL*
and
his
master
stopped
;
so
,
groping
his
way
cautiously
through
the
dark
*NL*
passage
,
and
bidding
Oliver
keep
close
to
him
and
not
be
afraid
the
*NL*
undertaker
mounted
to
the
top
of
the
first
flight
of
stairs
.
Stumbling
*NL*
against
a
door
on
the
landing
,
he
rapped
at
it
with
his
knuckles
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
opened
by
a
young
girl
of
thirteen
or
fourteen
.
The
undertaker
*NL*
at
once
saw
enough
of
what
the
room
contained
,
to
know
it
was
the
*NL*
apartment
to
which
he
had
been
directed
.
He
stepped
in
;
Oliver
*NL*
followed
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
fire
in
the
room
;
but
a
man
was
crouching
,
mechanically
,
*NL*
over
the
empty
stove
.
An
old
woman
,
too
,
had
drawn
a
low
stool
to
the
*NL*
cold
hearth
,
and
was
sitting
beside
him
.
There
were
some
ragged
*NL*
children
in
another
corner
;
and
in
a
small
recess
,
opposite
the
door
,
*NL*
there
lay
upon
the
ground
,
something
covered
with
an
old
blanket
.
*NL*
Oliver
shuddered
as
he
cast
his
eyes
toward
the
place
,
and
crept
*NL*
involuntarily
closer
to
his
master
;
for
though
it
was
covered
up
,
the
*NL*
boy
felt
that
it
was
a
corpse
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
's
face
was
thin
and
very
pale
;
his
hair
and
beard
were
grizzly
;
*NL*
his
eyes
were
bloodshot
.
The
old
woman
's
face
was
wrinkled
;
her
two
*NL*
remaining
teeth
protruded
over
her
under
lip
;
and
her
eyes
were
bright
*NL*
and
piercing
.
Oliver
was
afraid
to
look
at
either
her
or
the
man
.
*NL*
They
seemed
so
like
the
rats
he
had
seen
outside
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Nobody
shall
go
near
her
,
'
said
the
man
,
starting
fiercely
up
,
as
the
*NL*
undertaker
approached
the
recess
.
`
Keep
back
!
Damn
you
,
keep
back
,
if
*NL*
you
've
a
life
to
lose
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Nonsense
,
my
good
man
,
'
said
the
undertaker
,
who
was
pretty
well
used
*NL*
to
misery
in
all
its
shapes
.
`
Nonsense
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
tell
you
,
'
said
the
man
:
clenching
his
hands
,
and
stamping
*NL*
furiously
on
the
floor
,
--
'
I
tell
you
I
wo
n't
have
her
put
into
the
*NL*
ground
.
She
could
n't
rest
there
.
The
worms
would
worry
her
--
not
eat
*NL*
her
--
she
is
so
worn
away
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
undertaker
offered
no
reply
to
this
raving
;
but
producing
a
tape
*NL*
from
his
pocket
,
knelt
down
for
a
moment
by
the
side
of
the
body
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ah
!
'
said
the
man
:
bursting
into
tears
,
and
sinking
on
his
knees
at
*NL*
the
feet
of
the
dead
woman
;
`
kneel
down
,
kneel
down
--
kneel
round
her
,
*NL*
every
one
of
you
,
and
mark
my
words
!
I
say
she
was
starved
to
death
.
*NL*
I
never
knew
how
bad
she
was
,
till
the
fever
came
upon
her
;
and
then
*NL*
her
bones
were
starting
through
the
skin
.
There
was
neither
fire
nor
*NL*
candle
;
she
died
in
the
dark
--
in
the
dark
!
She
could
n't
even
see
her
*NL*
children
's
faces
,
though
we
heard
her
gasping
out
their
names
.
I
begged
*NL*
for
her
in
the
streets
:
and
they
sent
me
to
prison
.
When
I
came
back
,
*NL*
she
was
dying
;
and
all
the
blood
in
my
heart
has
dried
up
,
for
they
*NL*
starved
her
to
death
.
I
swear
it
before
the
God
that
saw
it
!
They
*NL*
starved
her
!
'
He
twined
his
hands
in
his
hair
;
and
,
with
a
loud
*NL*
scream
,
rolled
grovelling
upon
the
floor
:
his
eyes
fixed
,
and
the
foam
*NL*
covering
his
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
terrified
children
cried
bitterly
;
but
the
old
woman
,
who
had
*NL*
hitherto
remained
as
quiet
as
if
she
had
been
wholly
deaf
to
all
that
*NL*
passed
,
menaced
them
into
silence
.
Having
unloosened
the
cravat
of
the
*NL*
man
who
still
remained
extended
on
the
ground
,
she
tottered
towards
the
*NL*
undertaker
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
She
was
my
daughter
,
'
said
the
old
woman
,
nodding
her
head
in
the
*NL*
direction
of
the
corpse
;
and
speaking
with
an
idiotic
leer
,
more
*NL*
ghastly
than
even
the
presence
of
death
in
such
a
place
.
`
Lord
,
Lord
!
*NL*
Well
,
it
_
is
_
strange
that
I
who
gave
birth
to
her
,
and
was
a
woman
*NL*
then
,
should
be
alive
and
merry
now
,
and
she
lying
there
:
so
cold
and
*NL*
stiff
!
Lord
,
Lord
!
--
to
think
of
it
;
it
's
as
good
as
a
play
--
as
good
as
*NL*
a
play
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
wretched
creature
mumbled
and
chuckled
in
her
hideous
merriment
,
*NL*
the
undertaker
turned
to
go
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Stop
,
stop
!
'
said
the
old
woman
in
a
loud
whisper
.
`
Will
she
be
*NL*
buried
to-morrow
,
or
next
day
,
or
to-night
?
I
laid
her
out
;
and
I
must
*NL*
walk
,
you
know
.
Send
me
a
large
cloak
:
a
good
warm
one
:
for
it
is
*NL*
bitter
cold
.
We
should
have
cake
and
wine
,
too
,
before
we
go
!
Never
*NL*
mind
;
send
some
bread
--
only
a
loaf
of
bread
and
a
cup
of
water
.
Shall
*NL*
we
have
some
bread
,
dear
?
'
she
said
eagerly
:
catching
at
the
*NL*
undertaker
's
coat
,
as
he
once
more
moved
towards
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
yes
,
'
said
the
undertaker
,
`
of
course
.
Anything
you
like
!
'
He
*NL*
disengaged
himself
from
the
old
woman
's
grasp
;
and
,
drawing
Oliver
*NL*
after
him
,
hurried
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
,
-LRB-
the
family
having
been
meanwhile
relieved
with
a
*NL*
half-quartern
loaf
and
a
piece
of
cheese
,
left
with
them
by
Mr.
Bumble
*NL*
himself
,
-RRB-
Oliver
and
his
master
returned
to
the
miserable
abode
;
where
*NL*
Mr.
Bumble
had
already
arrived
,
accompanied
by
four
men
from
the
*NL*
workhouse
,
who
were
to
act
as
bearers
.
An
old
black
cloak
had
been
*NL*
thrown
over
the
rags
of
the
old
woman
and
the
man
;
and
the
bare
coffin
*NL*
having
been
screwed
down
,
was
hoisted
on
the
shoulders
of
the
bearers
,
*NL*
and
carried
into
the
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Now
,
you
must
put
your
best
leg
foremost
,
old
lady
!
'
whispered
*NL*
Sowerberry
in
the
old
woman
's
ear
;
`
we
are
rather
late
;
and
it
wo
n't
*NL*
do
,
to
keep
the
clergyman
waiting
.
Move
on
,
my
men
,
--
as
quick
as
you
*NL*
like
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
directed
,
the
bearers
trotted
on
under
their
light
burden
;
and
the
*NL*
two
mourners
kept
as
near
them
,
as
they
could
.
Mr.
Bumble
and
*NL*
Sowerberry
walked
at
a
good
smart
pace
in
front
;
and
Oliver
,
whose
legs
*NL*
were
not
so
long
as
his
master
's
,
ran
by
the
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
not
so
great
a
necessity
for
hurrying
as
Mr.
Sowerberry
had
*NL*
anticipated
,
however
;
for
when
they
reached
the
obscure
corner
of
the
*NL*
churchyard
in
which
the
nettles
grew
,
and
where
the
parish
graves
were
*NL*
made
,
the
clergyman
had
not
arrived
;
and
the
clerk
,
who
was
sitting
by
*NL*
the
vestry-room
fire
,
seemed
to
think
it
by
no
means
improbable
that
it
*NL*
might
be
an
hour
or
so
,
before
he
came
.
So
,
they
put
the
bier
on
the
*NL*
brink
of
the
grave
;
and
the
two
mourners
waited
patiently
in
the
damp
*NL*
clay
,
with
a
cold
rain
drizzling
down
,
while
the
ragged
boys
whom
the
*NL*
spectacle
had
attracted
into
the
churchyard
played
a
noisy
game
at
*NL*
hide-and-seek
among
the
tombstones
,
or
varied
their
amusements
by
*NL*
jumping
backwards
and
forwards
over
the
coffin
.
Mr.
Sowerberry
and
*NL*
Bumble
,
being
personal
friends
of
the
clerk
,
sat
by
the
fire
with
him
,
*NL*
and
read
the
paper
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
,
after
a
lapse
of
something
more
than
an
hour
,
Mr.
Bumble
,
*NL*
and
Sowerberry
,
and
the
clerk
,
were
seen
running
towards
the
grave
.
*NL*
Immediately
afterwards
,
the
clergyman
appeared
:
putting
on
his
surplice
*NL*
as
he
came
along
.
Mr.
Bumble
then
thrashed
a
boy
or
two
,
to
keep
up
*NL*
appearances
;
and
the
reverend
gentleman
,
having
read
as
much
of
the
*NL*
burial
service
as
could
be
compressed
into
four
minutes
,
gave
his
*NL*
surplice
to
the
clerk
,
and
walked
away
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Now
,
Bill
!
'
said
Sowerberry
to
the
grave-digger
.
`
Fill
up
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
no
very
difficult
task
,
for
the
grave
was
so
full
,
that
the
*NL*
uppermost
coffin
was
within
a
few
feet
of
the
surface
.
The
*NL*
grave-digger
shovelled
in
the
earth
;
stamped
it
loosely
down
with
his
*NL*
feet
:
shouldered
his
spade
;
and
walked
off
,
followed
by
the
boys
,
who
*NL*
murmured
very
loud
complaints
at
the
fun
being
over
so
soon
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Come
,
my
good
fellow
!
'
said
Bumble
,
tapping
the
man
on
the
back
.
`
They
*NL*
want
to
shut
up
the
yard
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
who
had
never
once
moved
,
since
he
had
taken
his
station
by
the
*NL*
grave
side
,
started
,
raised
his
head
,
stared
at
the
person
who
had
*NL*
addressed
him
,
walked
forward
for
a
few
paces
;
and
fell
down
in
a
*NL*
swoon
.
The
crazy
old
woman
was
too
much
occupied
in
bewailing
the
loss
*NL*
of
her
cloak
-LRB-
which
the
undertaker
had
taken
off
-RRB-
,
to
pay
him
any
*NL*
attention
;
so
they
threw
a
can
of
cold
water
over
him
;
and
when
he
came
*NL*
to
,
saw
him
safely
out
of
the
churchyard
,
locked
the
gate
,
and
departed
*NL*
on
their
different
ways
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
Oliver
,
'
said
Sowerberry
,
as
they
walked
home
,
`
how
do
you
like
*NL*
it
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Pretty
well
,
thank
you
,
sir
'
replied
Oliver
,
with
considerable
*NL*
hesitation
.
`
Not
very
much
,
sir
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ah
,
you
'll
get
used
to
it
in
time
,
Oliver
,
'
said
Sowerberry
.
`
Nothing
*NL*
when
you
_
are
_
used
to
it
,
my
boy
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Oliver
wondered
,
in
his
own
mind
,
whether
it
had
taken
a
very
long
time
*NL*
to
get
Mr.
Sowerberry
used
to
it
.
But
he
thought
it
better
not
to
ask
*NL*
the
question
;
and
walked
back
to
the
shop
:
thinking
over
all
he
had
*NL*
seen
and
heard
.

CHAPTER
VI
*NL*
*NL*
OLIVER
,
BEING
GOADED
BY
THE
TAUNTS
OF
NOAH
,
ROUSES
INTO
ACTION
,
AND
*NL*
RATHER
ASTONISHES
HIM
*NL*
*NL*
The
month
's
trial
over
,
Oliver
was
formally
apprenticed
.
It
was
a
nice
*NL*
sickly
season
just
at
this
time
.
In
commercial
phrase
,
coffins
were
*NL*
looking
up
;
and
,
in
the
course
of
a
few
weeks
,
Oliver
acquired
a
great
*NL*
deal
of
experience
.
The
success
of
Mr.
Sowerberry
's
ingenious
*NL*
speculation
,
exceeded
even
his
most
sanguine
hopes
.
The
oldest
*NL*
inhabitants
recollected
no
period
at
which
measles
had
been
so
*NL*
prevalent
,
or
so
fatal
to
infant
existence
;
and
many
were
the
mournful
*NL*
processions
which
little
Oliver
headed
,
in
a
hat-band
reaching
down
to
*NL*
his
knees
,
to
the
indescribable
admiration
and
emotion
of
all
the
*NL*
mothers
in
the
town
.
As
Oliver
accompanied
his
master
in
most
of
his
*NL*
adult
expeditions
too
,
in
order
that
he
might
acquire
that
equanimity
*NL*
of
demeanour
and
full
command
of
nerve
which
was
essential
to
a
*NL*
finished
undertaker
,
he
had
many
opportunities
of
observing
the
*NL*
beautiful
resignation
and
fortitude
with
which
some
strong-minded
*NL*
people
bear
their
trials
and
losses
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
instance
;
when
Sowerberry
had
an
order
for
the
burial
of
some
rich
*NL*
old
lady
or
gentleman
,
who
was
surrounded
by
a
great
number
of
nephews
*NL*
and
nieces
,
who
had
been
perfectly
inconsolable
during
the
previous
*NL*
illness
,
and
whose
grief
had
been
wholly
irrepressible
even
on
the
most
*NL*
public
occasions
,
they
would
be
as
happy
among
themselves
as
need
*NL*
be
--
quite
cheerful
and
contented
--
conversing
together
with
as
much
*NL*
freedom
and
gaiety
,
as
if
nothing
whatever
had
happened
to
disturb
*NL*
them
.
Husbands
,
too
,
bore
the
loss
of
their
wives
with
the
most
heroic
*NL*
calmness
.
Wives
,
again
,
put
on
weeds
for
their
husbands
,
as
if
,
so
far
*NL*
from
grieving
in
the
garb
of
sorrow
,
they
had
made
up
their
minds
to
*NL*
render
it
as
becoming
and
attractive
as
possible
.
It
was
observable
,
*NL*
too
,
that
ladies
and
gentlemen
who
were
in
passions
of
anguish
during
*NL*
the
ceremony
of
interment
,
recovered
almost
as
soon
as
they
reached
*NL*
home
,
and
became
quite
composed
before
the
tea-drinking
was
over
.
All
*NL*
this
was
very
pleasant
and
improving
to
see
;
and
Oliver
beheld
it
with
*NL*
great
admiration
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
Oliver
Twist
was
moved
to
resignation
by
the
example
of
these
good
*NL*
people
,
I
can
not
,
although
I
am
his
biographer
,
undertake
to
affirm
*NL*
with
any
degree
of
confidence
;
but
I
can
most
distinctly
say
,
that
for
*NL*
many
months
he
continued
meekly
to
submit
to
the
domination
and
*NL*
ill-treatment
of
Noah
Claypole
:
who
used
him
far
worse
than
before
,
now
*NL*
that
his
jealousy
was
roused
by
seeing
the
new
boy
promoted
to
the
*NL*
black
stick
and
hatband
,
while
he
,
the
old
one
,
remained
stationary
in
*NL*
the
muffin-cap
and
leathers
.
Charlotte
treated
him
ill
,
because
Noah
*NL*
did
;
and
Mrs.
Sowerberry
was
his
decided
enemy
,
because
Mr.
Sowerberry
*NL*
was
disposed
to
be
his
friend
;
so
,
between
these
three
on
one
side
,
and
*NL*
a
glut
of
funerals
on
the
other
,
Oliver
was
not
altogether
as
*NL*
comfortable
as
the
hungry
pig
was
,
when
he
was
shut
up
,
by
mistake
,
in
*NL*
the
grain
department
of
a
brewery
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
,
I
come
to
a
very
important
passage
in
Oliver
's
history
;
for
I
*NL*
have
to
record
an
act
,
slight
and
unimportant
perhaps
in
appearance
,
*NL*
but
which
indirectly
produced
a
material
change
in
all
his
future
*NL*
prospects
and
proceedings
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
,
Oliver
and
Noah
had
descended
into
the
kitchen
at
the
usual
*NL*
dinner-hour
,
to
banquet
upon
a
small
joint
of
mutton
--
a
pound
and
a
*NL*
half
of
the
worst
end
of
the
neck
--
when
Charlotte
being
called
out
of
*NL*
the
way
,
there
ensued
a
brief
interval
of
time
,
which
Noah
Claypole
,
*NL*
being
hungry
and
vicious
,
considered
he
could
not
possibly
devote
to
a
*NL*
worthier
purpose
than
aggravating
and
tantalising
young
Oliver
Twist
.
*NL*
*NL*
Intent
upon
this
innocent
amusement
,
Noah
put
his
feet
on
the
*NL*
table-cloth
;
and
pulled
Oliver
's
hair
;
and
twitched
his
ears
;
and
*NL*
expressed
his
opinion
that
he
was
a
`
sneak
'
;
and
furthermore
announced
*NL*
his
intention
of
coming
to
see
him
hanged
,
whenever
that
desirable
*NL*
event
should
take
place
;
and
entered
upon
various
topics
of
petty
*NL*
annoyance
,
like
a
malicious
and
ill-conditioned
charity-boy
as
he
was
.
*NL*
But
,
making
Oliver
cry
,
Noah
attempted
to
be
more
facetious
still
;
and
*NL*
in
his
attempt
,
did
what
many
sometimes
do
to
this
day
,
when
they
want
*NL*
to
be
funny
.
He
got
rather
personal
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Work
`
us
,
'
said
Noah
,
`
how
's
your
mother
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
She
's
dead
,
'
replied
Oliver
;
`
do
n't
you
say
anything
about
her
to
me
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Oliver
's
colour
rose
as
he
said
this
;
he
breathed
quickly
;
and
there
*NL*
was
a
curious
working
of
the
mouth
and
nostrils
,
which
Mr.
Claypole
*NL*
thought
must
be
the
immediate
precursor
of
a
violent
fit
of
crying
.
*NL*
Under
this
impression
he
returned
to
the
charge
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
did
she
die
of
,
Work
`
us
?
'
said
Noah
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Of
a
broken
heart
,
some
of
our
old
nurses
told
me
,
'
replied
Oliver
:
*NL*
more
as
if
he
were
talking
to
himself
,
than
answering
Noah
.
'
I
think
I
*NL*
know
what
it
must
be
to
die
of
that
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Tol
de
rol
lol
lol
,
right
fol
lairy
,
Work
`
us
,
'
said
Noah
,
as
a
tear
*NL*
rolled
down
Oliver
's
cheek
.
`
What
's
set
you
a
snivelling
now
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Not
_
you
_
,
'
replied
Oliver
,
sharply
.
`
There
;
that
's
enough
.
Do
n't
say
*NL*
anything
more
to
me
about
her
;
you
'd
better
not
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Better
not
!
'
exclaimed
Noah
.
`
Well
!
Better
not
!
Work
`
us
,
do
n't
be
*NL*
impudent
.
_
Your
_
mother
,
too
!
She
was
a
nice
`
un
she
was
.
Oh
,
Lor
!
'
*NL*
And
here
,
Noah
nodded
his
head
expressively
;
and
curled
up
as
much
of
*NL*
his
small
red
nose
as
muscular
action
could
collect
together
,
for
the
*NL*
occasion
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yer
know
,
Work
`
us
,
'
continued
Noah
,
emboldened
by
Oliver
's
silence
,
*NL*
and
speaking
in
a
jeering
tone
of
affected
pity
:
of
all
tones
the
most
*NL*
annoying
:
`
Yer
know
,
Work
`
us
,
it
ca
n't
be
helped
now
;
and
of
course
yer
*NL*
could
n't
help
it
then
;
and
I
am
very
sorry
for
it
;
and
I
'm
sure
we
all
*NL*
are
,
and
pity
yer
very
much
.
But
yer
must
know
,
Work
`
us
,
yer
mother
*NL*
was
a
regular
right-down
bad
`
un
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
did
you
say
?
'
inquired
Oliver
,
looking
up
very
quickly
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
A
regular
right-down
bad
`
un
,
Work
`
us
,
'
replied
Noah
,
coolly
.
`
And
*NL*
it
's
a
great
deal
better
,
Work
`
us
,
that
she
died
when
she
did
,
or
else
*NL*
she
'd
have
been
hard
labouring
in
Bridewell
,
or
transported
,
or
hung
;
*NL*
which
is
more
likely
than
either
,
is
n't
it
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
Crimson
with
fury
,
Oliver
started
up
;
overthrew
the
chair
and
table
;
*NL*
seized
Noah
by
the
throat
;
shook
him
,
in
the
violence
of
his
rage
,
till
*NL*
his
teeth
chattered
in
his
head
;
and
collecting
his
whole
force
into
*NL*
one
heavy
blow
,
felled
him
to
the
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
minute
ago
,
the
boy
had
looked
the
quiet
child
,
mild
,
dejected
*NL*
creature
that
harsh
treatment
had
made
him
.
But
his
spirit
was
roused
*NL*
at
last
;
the
cruel
insult
to
his
dead
mother
had
set
his
blood
on
fire
.
*NL*
His
breast
heaved
;
his
attitude
was
erect
;
his
eye
bright
and
vivid
;
*NL*
his
whole
person
changed
,
as
he
stood
glaring
over
the
cowardly
*NL*
tormentor
who
now
lay
crouching
at
his
feet
;
and
defied
him
with
an
*NL*
energy
he
had
never
known
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
'll
murder
me
!
'
blubbered
Noah
.
`
Charlotte
!
missis
!
Here
's
the
*NL*
new
boy
a
murdering
of
me
!
Help
!
help
!
Oliver
's
gone
mad
!
*NL*
Char
--
lotte
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Noah
's
shouts
were
responded
to
,
by
a
loud
scream
from
Charlotte
,
and
a
*NL*
louder
from
Mrs.
Sowerberry
;
the
former
of
whom
rushed
into
the
kitchen
*NL*
by
a
side-door
,
while
the
latter
paused
on
the
staircase
till
she
was
*NL*
quite
certain
that
it
was
consistent
with
the
preservation
of
human
*NL*
life
,
to
come
further
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
,
you
little
wretch
!
'
screamed
Charlotte
:
seizing
Oliver
with
her
*NL*
utmost
force
,
which
was
about
equal
to
that
of
a
moderately
strong
man
*NL*
in
particularly
good
training
.
`
Oh
,
you
little
un-grate-ful
,
*NL*
mur-de-rous
,
hor-rid
villain
!
'
And
between
every
syllable
,
Charlotte
*NL*
gave
Oliver
a
blow
with
all
her
might
:
accompanying
it
with
a
scream
,
*NL*
for
the
benefit
of
society
.
*NL*
*NL*
Charlotte
's
fist
was
by
no
means
a
light
one
;
but
,
lest
it
should
not
*NL*
be
effectual
in
calming
Oliver
's
wrath
,
Mrs.
Sowerberry
plunged
into
*NL*
the
kitchen
,
and
assisted
to
hold
him
with
one
hand
,
while
she
*NL*
scratched
his
face
with
the
other
.
In
this
favourable
position
of
*NL*
affairs
,
Noah
rose
from
the
ground
,
and
pommelled
him
behind
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
rather
too
violent
exercise
to
last
long
.
When
they
were
all
*NL*
wearied
out
,
and
could
tear
and
beat
no
longer
,
they
dragged
Oliver
,
*NL*
struggling
and
shouting
,
but
nothing
daunted
,
into
the
dust-cellar
,
and
*NL*
there
locked
him
up
.
This
being
done
,
Mrs.
Sowerberry
sunk
into
a
*NL*
chair
,
and
burst
into
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Bless
her
,
she
's
going
off
!
'
said
Charlotte
.
'
A
glass
of
water
,
Noah
,
*NL*
dear
.
Make
haste
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
!
Charlotte
,
'
said
Mrs.
Sowerberry
:
speaking
as
well
as
she
could
,
*NL*
through
a
deficiency
of
breath
,
and
a
sufficiency
of
cold
water
,
which
*NL*
Noah
had
poured
over
her
head
and
shoulders
.
`
Oh
!
Charlotte
,
what
a
*NL*
mercy
we
have
not
all
been
murdered
in
our
beds
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ah
!
mercy
indeed
,
ma'am
,
'
was
the
reply
.
I
only
hope
this
'll
teach
*NL*
master
not
to
have
any
more
of
these
dreadful
creatures
,
that
are
born
*NL*
to
be
murderers
and
robbers
from
their
very
cradle
.
Poor
Noah
!
He
was
*NL*
all
but
killed
,
ma'am
,
when
I
come
in
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Poor
fellow
!
'
said
Mrs.
Sowerberry
:
looking
piteously
on
the
*NL*
charity-boy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Noah
,
whose
top
waistcoat-button
might
have
been
somewhere
on
a
level
*NL*
with
the
crown
of
Oliver
's
head
,
rubbed
his
eyes
with
the
inside
of
his
*NL*
wrists
while
this
commiseration
was
bestowed
upon
him
,
and
performed
*NL*
some
affecting
tears
and
sniffs
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
's
to
be
done
!
'
exclaimed
Mrs.
Sowerberry
.
`
Your
master
's
not
at
*NL*
home
;
there
's
not
a
man
in
the
house
,
and
he
'll
kick
that
door
down
in
*NL*
ten
minutes
.
'
Oliver
's
vigorous
plunges
against
the
bit
of
timber
in
*NL*
question
,
rendered
this
occurance
highly
probable
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Dear
,
dear
!
I
do
n't
know
,
ma'am
,
'
said
Charlotte
,
`
unless
we
send
for
*NL*
the
police-officers
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Or
the
millingtary
,
'
suggested
Mr.
Claypole
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
no
,
'
said
Mrs.
Sowerberry
:
bethinking
herself
of
Oliver
's
old
*NL*
friend
.
`
Run
to
Mr.
Bumble
,
Noah
,
and
tell
him
to
come
here
directly
,
*NL*
and
not
to
lose
a
minute
;
never
mind
your
cap
!
Make
haste
!
You
can
*NL*
hold
a
knife
to
that
black
eye
,
as
you
run
along
.
It
'll
keep
the
*NL*
swelling
down
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Noah
stopped
to
make
no
reply
,
but
started
off
at
his
fullest
speed
;
*NL*
and
very
much
it
astonished
the
people
who
were
out
walking
,
to
see
a
*NL*
charity-boy
tearing
through
the
streets
pell-mell
,
with
no
cap
on
his
*NL*
head
,
and
a
clasp-knife
at
his
eye
.

CHAPTER
VII
*NL*
*NL*
OLIVER
CONTINUES
REFRACTORY
*NL*
*NL*
Noah
Claypole
ran
along
the
streets
at
his
swiftest
pace
,
and
paused
*NL*
not
once
for
breath
,
until
he
reached
the
workhouse-gate
.
Having
rested
*NL*
here
,
for
a
minute
or
so
,
to
collect
a
good
burst
of
sobs
and
an
*NL*
imposing
show
of
tears
and
terror
,
he
knocked
loudly
at
the
wicket
;
and
*NL*
presented
such
a
rueful
face
to
the
aged
pauper
who
opened
it
,
that
*NL*
even
he
,
who
saw
nothing
but
rueful
faces
about
him
at
the
best
of
*NL*
times
,
started
back
in
astonishment
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
what
's
the
matter
with
the
boy
!
'
said
the
old
pauper
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Mr.
Bumble
!
Mr.
Bumble
!
'
cried
Noah
,
with
well-affected
dismay
:
and
*NL*
in
tones
so
loud
and
agitated
,
that
they
not
only
caught
the
ear
of
Mr.
*NL*
Bumble
himself
,
who
happened
to
be
hard
by
,
but
alarmed
him
so
much
*NL*
that
he
rushed
into
the
yard
without
his
cocked
hat
,
--
which
is
a
very
*NL*
curious
and
remarkable
circumstance
:
as
showing
that
even
a
beadle
,
*NL*
acted
upon
a
sudden
and
powerful
impulse
,
may
be
afflicted
with
a
*NL*
momentary
visitation
of
loss
of
self-possession
,
and
forgetfulness
of
*NL*
personal
dignity
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
,
Mr.
Bumble
,
sir
!
'
said
Noah
:
`
Oliver
,
sir
,
--
Oliver
has
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
?
What
?
'
interposed
Mr.
Bumble
:
with
a
gleam
of
pleasure
in
his
*NL*
metallic
eyes
.
`
Not
run
away
;
he
has
n't
run
away
,
has
he
,
Noah
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
sir
,
no
.
Not
run
away
,
sir
,
but
he
's
turned
wicious
,
'
replied
*NL*
Noah
.
`
He
tried
to
murder
me
,
sir
;
and
then
he
tried
to
murder
*NL*
Charlotte
;
and
then
missis
.
Oh
!
what
dreadful
pain
it
is
!
*NL*
*NL*
Such
agony
,
please
,
sir
!
'
And
here
,
Noah
writhed
and
twisted
his
body
*NL*
into
an
extensive
variety
of
eel-like
positions
;
thereby
giving
Mr.
*NL*
Bumble
to
understand
that
,
from
the
violent
and
sanguinary
onset
of
*NL*
Oliver
Twist
,
he
had
sustained
severe
internal
injury
and
damage
,
from
*NL*
which
he
was
at
that
moment
suffering
the
acutest
torture
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Noah
saw
that
the
intelligence
he
communicated
perfectly
paralysed
*NL*
Mr.
Bumble
,
he
imparted
additional
effect
thereunto
,
by
bewailing
his
*NL*
dreadful
wounds
ten
times
louder
than
before
;
and
when
he
observed
a
*NL*
gentleman
in
a
white
waistcoat
crossing
the
yard
,
he
was
more
tragic
in
*NL*
his
lamentations
than
ever
:
rightly
conceiving
it
highly
expedient
to
*NL*
attract
the
notice
,
and
rouse
the
indignation
,
of
the
gentleman
*NL*
aforesaid
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
gentleman
's
notice
was
very
soon
attracted
;
for
he
had
not
walked
*NL*
three
paces
,
when
he
turned
angrily
round
,
and
inquired
what
that
young
*NL*
cur
was
howling
for
,
and
why
Mr.
Bumble
did
not
favour
him
with
*NL*
something
which
would
render
the
series
of
vocular
exclamations
so
*NL*
designated
,
an
involuntary
process
?
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
's
a
poor
boy
from
the
free-school
,
sir
,
'
replied
Mr.
Bumble
,
`
who
*NL*
has
been
nearly
murdered
--
all
but
murdered
,
sir
,
--
by
young
Twist
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
By
Jove
!
'
exclaimed
the
gentleman
in
the
white
waistcoat
,
stopping
*NL*
short
.
'
I
knew
it
!
I
felt
a
strange
presentiment
from
the
very
first
,
*NL*
that
that
audacious
young
savage
would
come
to
be
hung
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
has
likewise
attempted
,
sir
,
to
murder
the
female
servant
,
'
said
*NL*
Mr.
Bumble
,
with
a
face
of
ashy
paleness
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
his
missis
,
'
interposed
Mr.
Claypole
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
his
master
,
too
,
I
think
you
said
,
Noah
?
'
added
Mr.
Bumble
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
!
he
's
out
,
or
he
would
have
murdered
him
,
'
replied
Noah
.
`
He
said
*NL*
he
wanted
to
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ah
!
Said
he
wanted
to
,
did
he
,
my
boy
?
'
inquired
the
gentleman
in
the
*NL*
white
waistcoat
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
sir
,
'
replied
Noah
.
`
And
please
,
sir
,
missis
wants
to
know
*NL*
whether
Mr.
Bumble
can
spare
time
to
step
up
there
,
directly
,
and
flog
*NL*
him
--
'cause
master
's
out
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Certainly
,
my
boy
;
certainly
,
'
said
the
gentleman
in
the
white
*NL*
waistcoat
:
smiling
benignly
,
and
patting
Noah
's
head
,
which
was
about
*NL*
three
inches
higher
than
his
own
.
`
You
're
a
good
boy
--
a
very
good
boy
.
*NL*
Here
's
a
penny
for
you
.
Bumble
,
just
step
up
to
Sowerberry
's
with
your
*NL*
cane
,
and
see
what
's
best
to
be
done
.
Do
n't
spare
him
,
Bumble
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
I
will
not
,
sir
,
'
replied
the
beadle
.
And
the
cocked
hat
and
cane
*NL*
having
been
,
by
this
time
,
adjusted
to
their
owner
's
satisfaction
,
Mr.
*NL*
Bumble
and
Noah
Claypole
betook
themselves
with
all
speed
to
the
*NL*
undertaker
's
shop
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
the
position
of
affairs
had
not
at
all
improved
.
Sowerberry
had
*NL*
not
yet
returned
,
and
Oliver
continued
to
kick
,
with
undiminished
*NL*
vigour
,
at
the
cellar-door
.
The
accounts
of
his
ferocity
as
related
by
*NL*
Mrs.
Sowerberry
and
Charlotte
,
were
of
so
startling
a
nature
,
that
Mr.
*NL*
Bumble
judged
it
prudent
to
parley
,
before
opening
the
door
.
With
this
*NL*
view
he
gave
a
kick
at
the
outside
,
by
way
of
prelude
;
and
,
then
,
*NL*
applying
his
mouth
to
the
keyhole
,
said
,
in
a
deep
and
impressive
tone
:
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oliver
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Come
;
you
let
me
out
!
'
replied
Oliver
,
from
the
inside
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Do
you
know
this
here
voice
,
Oliver
?
'
said
Mr.
Bumble
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
'
replied
Oliver
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ai
n't
you
afraid
of
it
,
sir
?
Ai
n't
you
a-trembling
while
I
speak
,
*NL*
sir
?
'
said
Mr.
Bumble
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
!
'
replied
Oliver
,
boldly
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
answer
so
different
from
the
one
he
had
expected
to
elicit
,
and
was
*NL*
in
the
habit
of
receiving
,
staggered
Mr.
Bumble
not
a
little
.
He
*NL*
stepped
back
from
the
keyhole
;
drew
himself
up
to
his
full
height
;
and
*NL*
looked
from
one
to
another
of
the
three
bystanders
,
in
mute
*NL*
astonishment
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
,
you
know
,
Mr.
Bumble
,
he
must
be
mad
,
'
said
Mrs.
Sowerberry
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
boy
in
half
his
senses
could
venture
to
speak
so
to
you
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
's
not
Madness
,
ma'am
,
'
replied
Mr.
Bumble
,
after
a
few
moments
of
*NL*
deep
meditation
.
`
It
's
Meat
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
?
'
exclaimed
Mrs.
Sowerberry
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Meat
,
ma'am
,
meat
,
'
replied
Bumble
,
with
stern
emphasis
.
`
You
've
*NL*
over-fed
him
,
ma'am
.
You
've
raised
a
artificial
soul
and
spirit
in
*NL*
him
,
ma'am
unbecoming
a
person
of
his
condition
:
as
the
board
,
Mrs.
*NL*
Sowerberry
,
who
are
practical
philosophers
,
will
tell
you
.
What
have
*NL*
paupers
to
do
with
soul
or
spirit
?
It
's
quite
enough
that
we
let
'em
*NL*
have
live
bodies
.
If
you
had
kept
the
boy
on
gruel
,
ma'am
,
this
would
*NL*
never
have
happened
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Dear
,
dear
!
'
ejaculated
Mrs.
Sowerberry
,
piously
raising
her
eyes
to
*NL*
the
kitchen
ceiling
:
`
this
comes
of
being
liberal
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
liberality
of
Mrs.
Sowerberry
to
Oliver
,
had
consisted
of
a
profuse
*NL*
bestowal
upon
him
of
all
the
dirty
odds
and
ends
which
nobody
else
*NL*
would
eat
;
so
there
was
a
great
deal
of
meekness
and
self-devotion
in
*NL*
her
voluntarily
remaining
under
Mr.
Bumble
's
heavy
accusation
.
Of
*NL*
which
,
to
do
her
justice
,
she
was
wholly
innocent
,
in
thought
,
word
,
or
*NL*
deed
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ah
!
'
said
Mr.
Bumble
,
when
the
lady
brought
her
eyes
down
to
earth
*NL*
again
;
`
the
only
thing
that
can
be
done
now
,
that
I
know
of
,
is
to
*NL*
leave
him
in
the
cellar
for
a
day
or
so
,
till
he
's
a
little
starved
*NL*
down
;
and
then
to
take
him
out
,
and
keep
him
on
gruel
all
through
the
*NL*
apprenticeship
.
He
comes
of
a
bad
family
.
Excitable
natures
,
Mrs.
*NL*
Sowerberry
!
Both
the
nurse
and
doctor
said
,
that
that
mother
of
his
*NL*
made
her
way
here
,
against
difficulties
and
pain
that
would
have
killed
*NL*
any
well-disposed
woman
,
weeks
before
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
point
of
Mr.
Bumble
's
discourse
,
Oliver
,
just
hearing
enough
to
*NL*
know
that
some
allusion
was
being
made
to
his
mother
,
recommenced
*NL*
kicking
,
with
a
violence
that
rendered
every
other
sound
inaudible
.
*NL*
Sowerberry
returned
at
this
juncture
.
Oliver
's
offence
having
been
*NL*
explained
to
him
,
with
such
exaggerations
as
the
ladies
thought
best
*NL*
calculated
to
rouse
his
ire
,
he
unlocked
the
cellar-door
in
a
*NL*
twinkling
,
and
dragged
his
rebellious
apprentice
out
,
by
the
collar
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oliver
's
clothes
had
been
torn
in
the
beating
he
had
received
;
his
face
*NL*
was
bruised
and
scratched
;
and
his
hair
scattered
over
his
forehead
.
*NL*
The
angry
flush
had
not
disappeared
,
however
;
and
when
he
was
pulled
*NL*
out
of
his
prison
,
he
scowled
boldly
on
Noah
,
and
looked
quite
*NL*
undismayed
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Now
,
you
are
a
nice
young
fellow
,
ai
n't
you
?
'
said
Sowerberry
;
giving
*NL*
Oliver
a
shake
,
and
a
box
on
the
ear
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
called
my
mother
names
,
'
replied
Oliver
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
and
what
if
he
did
,
you
little
ungrateful
wretch
?
'
said
Mrs.
*NL*
Sowerberry
.
`
She
deserved
what
he
said
,
and
worse
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
She
did
n't
'
said
Oliver
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
She
did
,
'
said
Mrs.
Sowerberry
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
's
a
lie
!
'
said
Oliver
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Sowerberry
burst
into
a
flood
of
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
flood
of
tears
left
Mr.
Sowerberry
no
alternative
.
If
he
had
*NL*
hesitated
for
one
instant
to
punish
Oliver
most
severely
,
it
must
be
*NL*
quite
clear
to
every
experienced
reader
that
he
would
have
been
,
*NL*
according
to
all
precedents
in
disputes
of
matrimony
established
,
a
*NL*
brute
,
an
unnatural
husband
,
an
insulting
creature
,
a
base
imitation
of
*NL*
a
man
,
and
various
other
agreeable
characters
too
numerous
for
recital
*NL*
within
the
limits
of
this
chapter
.
To
do
him
justice
,
he
was
,
as
far
*NL*
as
his
power
went
--
it
was
not
very
extensive
--
kindly
disposed
towards
*NL*
the
boy
;
perhaps
,
because
it
was
his
interest
to
be
so
;
perhaps
,
*NL*
because
his
wife
disliked
him
.
The
flood
of
tears
,
however
,
left
him
no
*NL*
resource
;
so
he
at
once
gave
him
a
drubbing
,
which
satisfied
even
Mrs.
*NL*
Sowerberry
herself
,
and
rendered
Mr.
Bumble
's
subsequent
application
of
*NL*
the
parochial
cane
,
rather
unnecessary
.
For
the
rest
of
the
day
,
he
*NL*
was
shut
up
in
the
back
kitchen
,
in
company
with
a
pump
and
a
slice
of
*NL*
bread
;
and
at
night
,
Mrs.
Sowerberry
,
after
making
various
remarks
*NL*
outside
the
door
,
by
no
means
complimentary
to
the
memory
of
his
*NL*
mother
,
looked
into
the
room
,
and
,
amidst
the
jeers
and
pointings
of
*NL*
Noah
and
Charlotte
,
ordered
him
upstairs
to
his
dismal
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
until
he
was
left
alone
in
the
silence
and
stillness
of
the
*NL*
gloomy
workshop
of
the
undertaker
,
that
Oliver
gave
way
to
the
feelings
*NL*
which
the
day
's
treatment
may
be
supposed
likely
to
have
awakened
in
a
*NL*
mere
child
.
He
had
listened
to
their
taunts
with
a
look
of
contempt
;
*NL*
he
had
borne
the
lash
without
a
cry
:
for
he
felt
that
pride
swelling
in
*NL*
his
heart
which
would
have
kept
down
a
shriek
to
the
last
,
though
they
*NL*
had
roasted
him
alive
.
But
now
,
when
there
were
none
to
see
or
hear
*NL*
him
,
he
fell
upon
his
knees
on
the
floor
;
and
,
hiding
his
face
in
his
*NL*
hands
,
wept
such
tears
as
,
God
send
for
the
credit
of
our
nature
,
few
*NL*
so
young
may
ever
have
cause
to
pour
out
before
him
!
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
long
time
,
Oliver
remained
motionless
in
this
attitude
.
The
*NL*
candle
was
burning
low
in
the
socket
when
he
rose
to
his
feet
.
Having
*NL*
gazed
cautiously
round
him
,
and
listened
intently
,
he
gently
undid
the
*NL*
fastenings
of
the
door
,
and
looked
abroad
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
cold
,
dark
night
.
The
stars
seemed
,
to
the
boy
's
eyes
,
*NL*
farther
from
the
earth
than
he
had
ever
seen
them
before
;
there
was
no
*NL*
wind
;
and
the
sombre
shadows
thrown
by
the
trees
upon
the
ground
,
*NL*
looked
sepulchral
and
death-like
,
from
being
so
still
.
He
softly
*NL*
reclosed
the
door
.
Having
availed
himself
of
the
expiring
light
of
the
*NL*
candle
to
tie
up
in
a
handkerchief
the
few
articles
of
wearing
apparel
*NL*
he
had
,
sat
himself
down
upon
a
bench
,
to
wait
for
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
the
first
ray
of
light
that
struggled
through
the
crevices
in
the
*NL*
shutters
,
Oliver
arose
,
and
again
unbarred
the
door
.
One
timid
look
*NL*
around
--
one
moment
's
pause
of
hesitation
--
he
had
closed
it
behind
him
,
*NL*
and
was
in
the
open
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
to
the
right
and
to
the
left
,
uncertain
whither
to
fly
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
remembered
to
have
seen
the
waggons
,
as
they
went
out
,
toiling
up
*NL*
the
hill
.
He
took
the
same
route
;
and
arriving
at
a
footpath
across
*NL*
the
fields
:
which
he
knew
,
after
some
distance
,
led
out
again
into
the
*NL*
road
;
struck
into
it
,
and
walked
quickly
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
Along
this
same
footpath
,
Oliver
well-remembered
he
had
trotted
beside
*NL*
Mr.
Bumble
,
when
he
first
carried
him
to
the
workhouse
from
the
farm
.
*NL*
His
way
lay
directly
in
front
of
the
cottage
.
His
heart
beat
quickly
*NL*
when
he
bethought
himself
of
this
;
and
he
half
resolved
to
turn
back
.
*NL*
He
had
come
a
long
way
though
,
and
should
lose
a
great
deal
of
time
by
*NL*
doing
so
.
Besides
,
it
was
so
early
that
there
was
very
little
fear
of
*NL*
his
being
seen
;
so
he
walked
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
reached
the
house
.
There
was
no
appearance
of
its
inmates
stirring
*NL*
at
that
early
hour
.
Oliver
stopped
,
and
peeped
into
the
garden
.
A
*NL*
child
was
weeding
one
of
the
little
beds
;
as
he
stopped
,
he
raised
his
*NL*
pale
face
and
disclosed
the
features
of
one
of
his
former
companions
.
*NL*
Oliver
felt
glad
to
see
him
,
before
he
went
;
for
,
though
younger
than
*NL*
himself
,
he
had
been
his
little
friend
and
playmate
.
They
had
been
*NL*
beaten
,
and
starved
,
and
shut
up
together
,
many
and
many
a
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Hush
,
Dick
!
'
said
Oliver
,
as
the
boy
ran
to
the
gate
,
and
thrust
his
*NL*
thin
arm
between
the
rails
to
greet
him
.
`
Is
any
one
up
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Nobody
but
me
,
'
replied
the
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
mus
n't
say
you
saw
me
,
Dick
,
'
said
Oliver
.
'
I
am
running
away
.
*NL*
They
beat
and
ill-use
me
,
Dick
;
and
I
am
going
to
seek
my
fortune
,
some
*NL*
long
way
off
.
I
do
n't
know
where
.
How
pale
you
are
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
heard
the
doctor
tell
them
I
was
dying
,
'
replied
the
child
with
a
*NL*
faint
smile
.
'
I
am
very
glad
to
see
you
,
dear
;
but
do
n't
stop
,
do
n't
*NL*
stop
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
yes
,
I
will
,
to
say
good-b
`
ye
to
you
,
'
replied
Oliver
.
'
I
shall
*NL*
see
you
again
,
Dick
.
I
know
I
shall
!
You
will
be
well
and
happy
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
hope
so
,
'
replied
the
child
.
`
After
I
am
dead
,
but
not
before
.
I
*NL*
know
the
doctor
must
be
right
,
Oliver
,
because
I
dream
so
much
of
*NL*
Heaven
,
and
Angels
,
and
kind
faces
that
I
never
see
when
I
am
awake
.
*NL*
Kiss
me
,
'
said
the
child
,
climbing
up
the
low
gate
,
and
flinging
his
*NL*
little
arms
round
Oliver
's
neck
.
`
Good-b
`
ye
,
dear
!
God
bless
you
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
blessing
was
from
a
young
child
's
lips
,
but
it
was
the
first
that
*NL*
Oliver
had
ever
heard
invoked
upon
his
head
;
and
through
the
struggles
*NL*
and
sufferings
,
and
troubles
and
changes
,
of
his
after
life
,
he
never
*NL*
once
forgot
it
.

CHAPTER
VIII
*NL*
*NL*
OLIVER
WALKS
TO
LONDON
.
HE
ENCOUNTERS
ON
THE
ROAD
A
STRANGE
SORT
OF
*NL*
YOUNG
GENTLEMAN
*NL*
*NL*
Oliver
reached
the
stile
at
which
the
by-path
terminated
;
and
once
more
*NL*
gained
the
high-road
.
It
was
eight
o'clock
now
.
Though
he
was
nearly
*NL*
five
miles
away
from
the
town
,
he
ran
,
and
hid
behind
the
hedges
,
by
*NL*
turns
,
till
noon
:
fearing
that
he
might
be
pursued
and
overtaken
.
Then
*NL*
he
sat
down
to
rest
by
the
side
of
the
milestone
,
and
began
to
think
,
*NL*
for
the
first
time
,
where
he
had
better
go
and
try
to
live
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
stone
by
which
he
was
seated
,
bore
,
in
large
characters
,
an
*NL*
intimation
that
it
was
just
seventy
miles
from
that
spot
to
London
.
The
*NL*
name
awakened
a
new
train
of
ideas
in
the
boy
's
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
London
!
--
that
great
place
!
--
nobody
--
not
even
Mr.
Bumble
--
could
ever
*NL*
find
him
there
!
He
had
often
heard
the
old
men
in
the
workhouse
,
too
,
*NL*
say
that
no
lad
of
spirit
need
want
in
London
;
and
that
there
were
ways
*NL*
of
living
in
that
vast
city
,
which
those
who
had
been
bred
up
in
*NL*
country
parts
had
no
idea
of
.
It
was
the
very
place
for
a
homeless
*NL*
boy
,
who
must
die
in
the
streets
unless
some
one
helped
him
.
As
these
*NL*
things
passed
through
his
thoughts
,
he
jumped
upon
his
feet
,
and
again
*NL*
walked
forward
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
diminished
the
distance
between
himself
and
London
by
full
four
*NL*
miles
more
,
before
he
recollected
how
much
he
must
undergo
ere
he
could
*NL*
hope
to
reach
his
place
of
destination
.
As
this
consideration
forced
*NL*
itself
upon
him
,
he
slackened
his
pace
a
little
,
and
meditated
upon
his
*NL*
means
of
getting
there
.
He
had
a
crust
of
bread
,
a
coarse
shirt
,
and
*NL*
two
pairs
of
stockings
,
in
his
bundle
.
He
had
a
penny
too
--
a
gift
of
*NL*
Sowerberry
's
after
some
funeral
in
which
he
had
acquitted
himself
more
*NL*
than
ordinarily
well
--
in
his
pocket
.
'
A
clean
shirt
,
'
thought
Oliver
,
*NL*
`
is
a
very
comfortable
thing
;
and
so
are
two
pairs
of
darned
stockings
;
*NL*
and
so
is
a
penny
;
but
they
are
small
helps
to
a
sixty-five
miles
'
walk
*NL*
in
winter
time
.
'
But
Oliver
's
thoughts
,
like
those
of
most
other
*NL*
people
,
although
they
were
extremely
ready
and
active
to
point
out
his
*NL*
difficulties
,
were
wholly
at
a
loss
to
suggest
any
feasible
mode
of
*NL*
surmounting
them
;
so
,
after
a
good
deal
of
thinking
to
no
particular
*NL*
purpose
,
he
changed
his
little
bundle
over
to
the
other
shoulder
,
and
*NL*
trudged
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oliver
walked
twenty
miles
that
day
;
and
all
that
time
tasted
nothing
*NL*
but
the
crust
of
dry
bread
,
and
a
few
draughts
of
water
,
which
he
*NL*
begged
at
the
cottage-doors
by
the
road-side
.
When
the
night
came
,
he
*NL*
turned
into
a
meadow
;
and
,
creeping
close
under
a
hay-rick
,
determined
*NL*
to
lie
there
,
till
morning
.
He
felt
frightened
at
first
,
for
the
wind
*NL*
moaned
dismally
over
the
empty
fields
:
and
he
was
cold
and
hungry
,
and
*NL*
more
alone
than
he
had
ever
felt
before
.
Being
very
tired
with
his
*NL*
walk
,
however
,
he
soon
fell
asleep
and
forgot
his
troubles
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
felt
cold
and
stiff
,
when
he
got
up
next
morning
,
and
so
hungry
that
*NL*
he
was
obliged
to
exchange
the
penny
for
a
small
loaf
,
in
the
very
*NL*
first
village
through
which
he
passed
.
He
had
walked
no
more
than
*NL*
twelve
miles
,
when
night
closed
in
again
.
His
feet
were
sore
,
and
his
*NL*
legs
so
weak
that
they
trembled
beneath
him
.
Another
night
passed
in
*NL*
the
bleak
damp
air
,
made
him
worse
;
when
he
set
forward
on
his
journey
*NL*
next
morning
he
could
hardly
crawl
along
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
waited
at
the
bottom
of
a
steep
hill
till
a
stage-coach
came
up
,
and
*NL*
then
begged
of
the
outside
passengers
;
but
there
were
very
few
who
took
*NL*
any
notice
of
him
:
and
even
those
told
him
to
wait
till
they
got
to
the
*NL*
top
of
the
hill
,
and
then
let
them
see
how
far
he
could
run
for
a
*NL*
halfpenny
.
Poor
Oliver
tried
to
keep
up
with
the
coach
a
little
way
,
*NL*
but
was
unable
to
do
it
,
by
reason
of
his
fatigue
and
sore
feet
.
When
*NL*
the
outsides
saw
this
,
they
put
their
halfpence
back
into
their
pockets
*NL*
again
,
declaring
that
he
was
an
idle
young
dog
,
and
did
n't
deserve
*NL*
anything
;
and
the
coach
rattled
away
and
left
only
a
cloud
of
dust
*NL*
behind
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
some
villages
,
large
painted
boards
were
fixed
up
:
warning
all
*NL*
persons
who
begged
within
the
district
,
that
they
would
be
sent
to
*NL*
jail
.
This
frightened
Oliver
very
much
,
and
made
him
glad
to
get
out
*NL*
of
those
villages
with
all
possible
expedition
.
In
others
,
he
would
*NL*
stand
about
the
inn-yards
,
and
look
mournfully
at
every
one
who
passed
:
*NL*
a
proceeding
which
generally
terminated
in
the
landlady
's
ordering
one
*NL*
of
the
post-boys
who
were
lounging
about
,
to
drive
that
strange
boy
out
*NL*
of
the
place
,
for
she
was
sure
he
had
come
to
steal
something
.
If
he
*NL*
begged
at
a
farmer
's
house
,
ten
to
one
but
they
threatened
to
set
the
*NL*
dog
on
him
;
and
when
he
showed
his
nose
in
a
shop
,
they
talked
about
*NL*
the
beadle
--
which
brought
Oliver
's
heart
into
his
mouth
,
--
very
often
*NL*
the
only
thing
he
had
there
,
for
many
hours
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
fact
,
if
it
had
not
been
for
a
good-hearted
turnpike-man
,
and
a
*NL*
benevolent
old
lady
,
Oliver
's
troubles
would
have
been
shortened
by
the
*NL*
very
same
process
which
had
put
an
end
to
his
mother
's
;
in
other
words
,
*NL*
he
would
most
assuredly
have
fallen
dead
upon
the
king
's
highway
.
But
*NL*
the
turnpike-man
gave
him
a
meal
of
bread
and
cheese
;
and
the
old
lady
,
*NL*
who
had
a
shipwrecked
grandson
wandering
barefoot
in
some
distant
part
*NL*
of
the
earth
,
took
pity
upon
the
poor
orphan
,
and
gave
him
what
little
*NL*
she
could
afford
--
and
more
--
with
such
kind
and
gentle
words
,
and
such
*NL*
tears
of
sympathy
and
compassion
,
that
they
sank
deeper
into
Oliver
's
*NL*
soul
,
than
all
the
sufferings
he
had
ever
undergone
.
*NL*
*NL*
Early
on
the
seventh
morning
after
he
had
left
his
native
place
,
Oliver
*NL*
limped
slowly
into
the
little
town
of
Barnet
.
The
window-shutters
were
*NL*
closed
;
the
street
was
empty
;
not
a
soul
had
awakened
to
the
business
*NL*
of
the
day
.
The
sun
was
rising
in
all
its
splendid
beauty
;
but
the
*NL*
light
only
served
to
show
the
boy
his
own
lonesomeness
and
desolation
,
*NL*
as
he
sat
,
with
bleeding
feet
and
covered
with
dust
,
upon
a
door-step
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
degrees
,
the
shutters
were
opened
;
the
window-blinds
were
drawn
up
;
*NL*
and
people
began
passing
to
and
fro
.
Some
few
stopped
to
gaze
at
*NL*
Oliver
for
a
moment
or
two
,
or
turned
round
to
stare
at
him
as
they
*NL*
hurried
by
;
but
none
relieved
him
,
or
troubled
themselves
to
inquire
*NL*
how
he
came
there
.
He
had
no
heart
to
beg
.
And
there
he
sat
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
been
crouching
on
the
step
for
some
time
:
wondering
at
the
great
*NL*
number
of
public-houses
-LRB-
every
other
house
in
Barnet
was
a
tavern
,
*NL*
large
or
small
-RRB-
,
gazing
listlessly
at
the
coaches
as
they
passed
*NL*
through
,
and
thinking
how
strange
it
seemed
that
they
could
do
,
with
*NL*
ease
,
in
a
few
hours
,
what
it
had
taken
him
a
whole
week
of
courage
and
*NL*
determination
beyond
his
years
to
accomplish
:
when
he
was
roused
by
*NL*
observing
that
a
boy
,
who
had
passed
him
carelessly
some
minutes
*NL*
before
,
had
returned
,
and
was
now
surveying
him
most
earnestly
from
the
*NL*
opposite
side
of
the
way
.
He
took
little
heed
of
this
at
first
;
but
*NL*
the
boy
remained
in
the
same
attitude
of
close
observation
so
long
,
*NL*
that
Oliver
raised
his
head
,
and
returned
his
steady
look
.
Upon
this
,
*NL*
the
boy
crossed
over
;
and
walking
close
up
to
Oliver
,
said
,
*NL*
*NL*
`
Hullo
,
my
covey
!
What
's
the
row
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
boy
who
addressed
this
inquiry
to
the
young
wayfarer
,
was
about
his
*NL*
own
age
:
but
one
of
the
queerest
looking
boys
that
Oliver
had
even
*NL*
seen
.
He
was
a
snub-nosed
,
flat-browed
,
common-faced
boy
enough
;
and
*NL*
as
dirty
a
juvenile
as
one
would
wish
to
see
;
but
he
had
about
him
all
*NL*
the
airs
and
manners
of
a
man
.
He
was
short
of
his
age
:
with
rather
*NL*
bow-legs
,
and
little
,
sharp
,
ugly
eyes
.
His
hat
was
stuck
on
the
top
*NL*
of
his
head
so
lightly
,
that
it
threatened
to
fall
off
every
*NL*
moment
--
and
would
have
done
so
,
very
often
,
if
the
wearer
had
not
had
a
*NL*
knack
of
every
now
and
then
giving
his
head
a
sudden
twitch
,
which
*NL*
brought
it
back
to
its
old
place
again
.
He
wore
a
man
's
coat
,
which
*NL*
reached
nearly
to
his
heels
.
He
had
turned
the
cuffs
back
,
half-way
up
*NL*
his
arm
,
to
get
his
hands
out
of
the
sleeves
:
apparently
with
the
*NL*
ultimate
view
of
thrusting
them
into
the
pockets
of
his
corduroy
*NL*
trousers
;
for
there
he
kept
them
.
He
was
,
altogether
,
as
roystering
*NL*
and
swaggering
a
young
gentleman
as
ever
stood
four
feet
six
,
or
*NL*
something
less
,
in
the
bluchers
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Hullo
,
my
covey
!
What
's
the
row
?
'
said
this
strange
young
gentleman
*NL*
to
Oliver
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
am
very
hungry
and
tired
,
'
replied
Oliver
:
the
tears
standing
in
his
*NL*
eyes
as
he
spoke
.
'
I
have
walked
a
long
way
.
I
have
been
walking
these
*NL*
seven
days
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Walking
for
sivin
days
!
'
said
the
young
gentleman
.
`
Oh
,
I
see
.
Beak
's
*NL*
order
,
eh
?
But
,
'
he
added
,
noticing
Oliver
's
look
of
surprise
,
'
I
*NL*
suppose
you
do
n't
know
what
a
beak
is
,
my
flash
com-pan-i-on
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Oliver
mildly
replied
,
that
he
had
always
heard
a
bird
's
mouth
*NL*
described
by
the
term
in
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
My
eyes
,
how
green
!
'
exclaimed
the
young
gentleman
.
`
Why
,
a
beak
's
a
*NL*
madgst
`
rate
;
and
when
you
walk
by
a
beak
's
order
,
it
's
not
straight
*NL*
forerd
,
but
always
agoing
up
,
and
niver
a
coming
down
agin
.
Was
you
*NL*
never
on
the
mill
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
mill
?
'
inquired
Oliver
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
mill
!
Why
,
_
the
_
mill
--
the
mill
as
takes
up
so
little
room
that
*NL*
it
'll
work
inside
a
Stone
Jug
;
and
always
goes
better
when
the
wind
's
*NL*
low
with
people
,
than
when
it
's
high
;
acos
then
they
ca
n't
get
workmen
.
*NL*
But
come
,
'
said
the
young
gentleman
;
`
you
want
grub
,
and
you
shall
have
*NL*
it
.
I
'm
at
low-water-mark
myself
--
only
one
bob
and
a
magpie
;
but
,
as
*NL*
far
as
it
goes
,
I
'll
fork
out
and
stump
.
Up
with
you
on
your
pins
.
*NL*
There
!
Now
then
!
`
Morrice
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Assisting
Oliver
to
rise
,
the
young
gentleman
took
him
to
an
adjacent
*NL*
chandler
's
shop
,
where
he
purchased
a
sufficiency
of
ready-dressed
ham
*NL*
and
a
half-quartern
loaf
,
or
,
as
he
himself
expressed
it
,
'
a
fourpenny
*NL*
bran
!
'
the
ham
being
kept
clean
and
preserved
from
dust
,
by
the
*NL*
ingenious
expedient
of
making
a
hole
in
the
loaf
by
pulling
out
a
*NL*
portion
of
the
crumb
,
and
stuffing
it
therein
.
Taking
the
bread
under
*NL*
his
arm
,
the
young
gentlman
turned
into
a
small
public-house
,
and
led
*NL*
the
way
to
a
tap-room
in
the
rear
of
the
premises
.
Here
,
a
pot
of
beer
*NL*
was
brought
in
,
by
direction
of
the
mysterious
youth
;
and
Oliver
,
*NL*
falling
to
,
at
his
new
friend
's
bidding
,
made
a
long
and
hearty
meal
,
*NL*
during
the
progress
of
which
the
strange
boy
eyed
him
from
time
to
time
*NL*
with
great
attention
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Going
to
London
?
'
said
the
strange
boy
,
when
Oliver
had
at
length
*NL*
concluded
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Got
any
lodgings
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Money
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
strange
boy
whistled
;
and
put
his
arms
into
his
pockets
,
as
far
as
*NL*
the
big
coat-sleeves
would
let
them
go
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Do
you
live
in
London
?
'
inquired
Oliver
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
.
I
do
,
when
I
'm
at
home
,
'
replied
the
boy
.
'
I
suppose
you
want
*NL*
some
place
to
sleep
in
to-night
,
do
n't
you
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
do
,
indeed
,
'
answered
Oliver
.
'
I
have
not
slept
under
a
roof
since
I
*NL*
left
the
country
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Do
n't
fret
your
eyelids
on
that
score
,
'
said
the
young
gentleman
.
*NL*
`
I
've
got
to
be
in
London
to-night
;
and
I
know
a
`
spectable
old
*NL*
gentleman
as
lives
there
,
wot
'll
give
you
lodgings
for
nothink
,
and
*NL*
never
ask
for
the
change
--
that
is
,
if
any
genelman
he
knows
interduces
*NL*
you
.
And
do
n't
he
know
me
?
Oh
,
no
!
Not
in
the
least
!
By
no
means
.
*NL*
Certainly
not
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
gentleman
smiled
,
as
if
to
intimate
that
the
latter
fragments
*NL*
of
discourse
were
playfully
ironical
;
and
finished
the
beer
as
he
did
*NL*
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
unexpected
offer
of
shelter
was
too
tempting
to
be
resisted
;
*NL*
especially
as
it
was
immediately
followed
up
,
by
the
assurance
that
the
*NL*
old
gentleman
referred
to
,
would
doubtless
provide
Oliver
with
a
*NL*
comfortable
place
,
without
loss
of
time
.
This
led
to
a
more
friendly
*NL*
and
confidential
dialogue
;
from
which
Oliver
discovered
that
his
*NL*
friend
's
name
was
Jack
Dawkins
,
and
that
he
was
a
peculiar
pet
and
*NL*
protege
of
the
elderly
gentleman
before
mentioned
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Dawkin
's
appearance
did
not
say
a
vast
deal
in
favour
of
the
*NL*
comforts
which
his
patron
's
interest
obtained
for
those
whom
he
took
*NL*
under
his
protection
;
but
,
as
he
had
a
rather
flightly
and
dissolute
*NL*
mode
of
conversing
,
and
furthermore
avowed
that
among
his
intimate
*NL*
friends
he
was
better
known
by
the
sobriquet
of
`
The
Artful
Dodger
,
'
*NL*
Oliver
concluded
that
,
being
of
a
dissipated
and
careless
turn
,
the
*NL*
moral
precepts
of
his
benefactor
had
hitherto
been
thrown
away
upon
*NL*
him
.
Under
this
impression
,
he
secretly
resolved
to
cultivate
the
good
*NL*
opinion
of
the
old
gentleman
as
quickly
as
possible
;
and
,
if
he
found
*NL*
the
Dodger
incorrigible
,
as
he
more
than
half
suspected
he
should
,
to
*NL*
decline
the
honour
of
his
farther
acquaintance
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
John
Dawkins
objected
to
their
entering
London
before
nightfall
,
it
*NL*
was
nearly
eleven
o'clock
when
they
reached
the
turnpike
at
Islington
.
*NL*
They
crossed
from
the
Angel
into
St.
John
's
Road
;
struck
down
the
small
*NL*
street
which
terminates
at
Sadler
's
Wells
Theatre
;
through
Exmouth
*NL*
Street
and
Coppice
Row
;
down
the
little
court
by
the
side
of
the
*NL*
workhouse
;
across
the
classic
ground
which
once
bore
the
name
of
*NL*
Hockley-in-the-Hole
;
thence
into
Little
Saffron
Hill
;
and
so
into
*NL*
Saffron
Hill
the
Great
:
along
which
the
Dodger
scudded
at
a
rapid
pace
,
*NL*
directing
Oliver
to
follow
close
at
his
heels
.
*NL*
*NL*
Although
Oliver
had
enough
to
occupy
his
attention
in
keeping
sight
of
*NL*
his
leader
,
he
could
not
help
bestowing
a
few
hasty
glances
on
either
*NL*
side
of
the
way
,
as
he
passed
along
.
A
dirtier
or
more
wretched
place
*NL*
he
had
never
seen
.
The
street
was
very
narrow
and
muddy
,
and
the
air
*NL*
was
impregnated
with
filthy
odours
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
a
good
many
small
shops
;
but
the
only
stock
in
trade
*NL*
appeared
to
be
heaps
of
children
,
who
,
even
at
that
time
of
night
,
were
*NL*
crawling
in
and
out
at
the
doors
,
or
screaming
from
the
inside
.
The
*NL*
sole
places
that
seemed
to
prosper
amid
the
general
blight
of
the
*NL*
place
,
were
the
public-houses
;
and
in
them
,
the
lowest
orders
of
Irish
*NL*
were
wrangling
with
might
and
main
.
Covered
ways
and
yards
,
which
here
*NL*
and
there
diverged
from
the
main
street
,
disclosed
little
knots
of
*NL*
houses
,
where
drunken
men
and
women
were
positively
wallowing
in
filth
;
*NL*
and
from
several
of
the
door-ways
,
great
ill-looking
fellows
were
*NL*
cautiously
emerging
,
bound
,
to
all
appearance
,
on
no
very
well-disposed
*NL*
or
harmless
errands
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oliver
was
just
considering
whether
he
had
n't
better
run
away
,
when
*NL*
they
reached
the
bottom
of
the
hill
.
His
conductor
,
catching
him
by
*NL*
the
arm
,
pushed
open
the
door
of
a
house
near
Field
Lane
;
and
drawing
*NL*
him
into
the
passage
,
closed
it
behind
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Now
,
then
!
'
cried
a
voice
from
below
,
in
reply
to
a
whistle
from
the
*NL*
Dodger
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Plummy
and
slam
!
'
was
the
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
seemed
to
be
some
watchword
or
signal
that
all
was
right
;
for
the
*NL*
light
of
a
feeble
candle
gleamed
on
the
wall
at
the
remote
end
of
the
*NL*
passage
;
and
a
man
's
face
peeped
out
,
from
where
a
balustrade
of
the
*NL*
old
kitchen
staircase
had
been
broken
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
There
's
two
on
you
,
'
said
the
man
,
thrusting
the
candle
farther
out
,
*NL*
and
shielding
his
eyes
with
his
hand
.
`
Who
's
the
t
`
other
one
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
A
new
pal
,
'
replied
Jack
Dawkins
,
pulling
Oliver
forward
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Where
did
he
come
from
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Greenland
.
Is
Fagin
upstairs
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
he
's
a
sortin
'
the
wipes
.
Up
with
you
!
'
The
candle
was
drawn
*NL*
back
,
and
the
face
disappeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oliver
,
groping
his
way
with
one
hand
,
and
having
the
other
firmly
*NL*
grasped
by
his
companion
,
ascended
with
much
difficulty
the
dark
and
*NL*
broken
stairs
:
which
his
conductor
mounted
with
an
ease
and
expedition
*NL*
that
showed
he
was
well
acquainted
with
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
threw
open
the
door
of
a
back-room
,
and
drew
Oliver
in
after
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
walls
and
ceiling
of
the
room
were
perfectly
black
with
age
and
*NL*
dirt
.
There
was
a
deal
table
before
the
fire
:
upon
which
were
a
*NL*
candle
,
stuck
in
a
ginger-beer
bottle
,
two
or
three
pewter
pots
,
a
loaf
*NL*
and
butter
,
and
a
plate
.
In
a
frying-pan
,
which
was
on
the
fire
,
and
*NL*
which
was
secured
to
the
mantelshelf
by
a
string
,
some
sausages
were
*NL*
cooking
;
and
standing
over
them
,
with
a
toasting-fork
in
his
hand
,
was
*NL*
a
very
old
shrivelled
Jew
,
whose
villainous-looking
and
repulsive
face
*NL*
was
obscured
by
a
quantity
of
matted
red
hair
.
He
was
dressed
in
a
*NL*
greasy
flannel
gown
,
with
his
throat
bare
;
and
seemed
to
be
dividing
*NL*
his
attention
between
the
frying-pan
and
the
clothes-horse
,
over
which
*NL*
a
great
number
of
silk
handkerchiefs
were
hanging
.
Several
rough
beds
*NL*
made
of
old
sacks
,
were
huddled
side
by
side
on
the
floor
.
Seated
round
*NL*
the
table
were
four
or
five
boys
,
none
older
than
the
Dodger
,
smoking
*NL*
long
clay
pipes
,
and
drinking
spirits
with
the
air
of
middle-aged
men
.
*NL*
These
all
crowded
about
their
associate
as
he
whispered
a
few
words
to
*NL*
the
Jew
;
and
then
turned
round
and
grinned
at
Oliver
.
So
did
the
Jew
*NL*
himself
,
toasting-fork
in
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
This
is
him
,
Fagin
,
'
said
Jack
Dawkins
;
`
my
friend
Oliver
Twist
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
Jew
grinned
;
and
,
making
a
low
obeisance
to
Oliver
,
took
him
by
the
*NL*
hand
,
and
hoped
he
should
have
the
honour
of
his
intimate
acquaintance
.
*NL*
Upon
this
,
the
young
gentleman
with
the
pipes
came
round
him
,
and
shook
*NL*
both
his
hands
very
hard
--
especially
the
one
in
which
he
held
his
*NL*
little
bundle
.
One
young
gentleman
was
very
anxious
to
hang
up
his
cap
*NL*
for
him
;
and
another
was
so
obliging
as
to
put
his
hands
in
his
*NL*
pockets
,
in
order
that
,
as
he
was
very
tired
,
he
might
not
have
the
*NL*
trouble
of
emptying
them
,
himself
,
when
he
went
to
bed
.
These
*NL*
civilities
would
probably
be
extended
much
farther
,
but
for
a
liberal
*NL*
exercise
of
the
Jew
's
toasting-fork
on
the
heads
and
shoulders
of
the
*NL*
affectionate
youths
who
offered
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
We
are
very
glad
to
see
you
,
Oliver
,
very
,
'
said
the
Jew
.
`
Dodger
,
*NL*
take
off
the
sausages
;
and
draw
a
tub
near
the
fire
for
Oliver
.
Ah
,
*NL*
you
're
a-staring
at
the
pocket-handkerchiefs
!
eh
,
my
dear
.
There
are
a
*NL*
good
many
of
'em
,
ai
n't
there
?
We
've
just
looked
'em
out
,
ready
for
the
*NL*
wash
;
that
's
all
,
Oliver
;
that
's
all
.
Ha
!
ha
!
ha
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
latter
part
of
this
speech
,
was
hailed
by
a
boisterous
shout
from
*NL*
all
the
hopeful
pupils
of
the
merry
old
gentleman
.
In
the
midst
of
*NL*
which
they
went
to
supper
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oliver
ate
his
share
,
and
the
Jew
then
mixed
him
a
glass
of
hot
*NL*
gin-and-water
:
telling
him
he
must
drink
it
off
directly
,
because
*NL*
another
gentleman
wanted
the
tumbler
.
Oliver
did
as
he
was
desired
.
*NL*
Immediately
afterwards
he
felt
himself
gently
lifted
on
to
one
of
the
*NL*
sacks
;
and
then
he
sunk
into
a
deep
sleep
.

CHAPTER
IX
*NL*
*NL*
CONTAINING
FURTHER
PARTICULARS
CONCERNING
THE
PLEASANT
OLD
GENTLEMAN
,
*NL*
AND
HIS
HOPEFUL
PUPILS
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
late
next
morning
when
Oliver
awoke
,
from
a
sound
,
long
sleep
.
*NL*
There
was
no
other
person
in
the
room
but
the
old
Jew
,
who
was
boiling
*NL*
some
coffee
in
a
saucepan
for
breakfast
,
and
whistling
softly
to
*NL*
himself
as
he
stirred
it
round
and
round
,
with
an
iron
spoon
.
He
would
*NL*
stop
every
now
and
then
to
listen
when
there
was
the
least
noise
below
:
*NL*
and
when
he
had
satisfied
himself
,
he
would
go
on
whistling
and
*NL*
stirring
again
,
as
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
Although
Oliver
had
roused
himself
from
sleep
,
he
was
not
thoroughly
*NL*
awake
.
There
is
a
drowsy
state
,
between
sleeping
and
waking
,
when
you
*NL*
dream
more
in
five
minutes
with
your
eyes
half
open
,
and
yourself
half
*NL*
conscious
of
everything
that
is
passing
around
you
,
than
you
would
in
*NL*
five
nights
with
your
eyes
fast
closed
,
and
your
senses
wrapt
in
*NL*
perfect
unconsciousness
.
At
such
time
,
a
mortal
knows
just
enough
of
*NL*
what
his
mind
is
doing
,
to
form
some
glimmering
conception
of
its
*NL*
mighty
powers
,
its
bounding
from
earth
and
spurning
time
and
space
,
*NL*
when
freed
from
the
restraint
of
its
corporeal
associate
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oliver
was
precisely
in
this
condition
.
He
saw
the
Jew
with
his
*NL*
half-closed
eyes
;
heard
his
low
whistling
;
and
recognised
the
sound
of
*NL*
the
spoon
grating
against
the
saucepan
's
sides
:
and
yet
the
self-same
*NL*
senses
were
mentally
engaged
,
at
the
same
time
,
in
busy
action
with
*NL*
almost
everybody
he
had
ever
known
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
coffee
was
done
,
the
Jew
drew
the
saucepan
to
the
hob
.
*NL*
Standing
,
then
in
an
irresolute
attitude
for
a
few
minutes
,
as
if
he
*NL*
did
not
well
know
how
to
employ
himself
,
he
turned
round
and
looked
at
*NL*
Oliver
,
and
called
him
by
his
name
.
He
did
not
answer
,
and
was
to
all
*NL*
appearances
asleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
satisfying
himself
upon
this
head
,
the
Jew
stepped
gently
to
the
*NL*
door
:
which
he
fastened
.
He
then
drew
forth
:
as
it
seemed
to
Oliver
,
*NL*
from
some
trap
in
the
floor
:
a
small
box
,
which
he
placed
carefully
on
*NL*
the
table
.
His
eyes
glistened
as
he
raised
the
lid
,
and
looked
in
.
*NL*
Dragging
an
old
chair
to
the
table
,
he
sat
down
;
and
took
from
it
a
*NL*
magnificent
gold
watch
,
sparkling
with
jewels
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Aha
!
'
said
the
Jew
,
shrugging
up
his
shoulders
,
and
distorting
every
*NL*
feature
with
a
hideous
grin
.
`
Clever
dogs
!
Clever
dogs
!
Staunch
to
the
*NL*
last
!
Never
told
the
old
parson
where
they
were
.
Never
poached
upon
old
*NL*
Fagin
!
And
why
should
they
?
It
would
n't
have
loosened
the
knot
,
or
kept
*NL*
the
drop
up
,
a
minute
longer
.
No
,
no
,
no
!
Fine
fellows
!
Fine
fellows
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
With
these
,
and
other
muttered
reflections
of
the
like
nature
,
the
Jew
*NL*
once
more
deposited
the
watch
in
its
place
of
safety
.
At
least
half
a
*NL*
dozen
more
were
severally
drawn
forth
from
the
same
box
,
and
surveyed
*NL*
with
equal
pleasure
;
besides
rings
,
brooches
,
bracelets
,
and
other
*NL*
articles
of
jewellery
,
of
such
magnificent
materials
,
and
costly
*NL*
workmanship
,
that
Oliver
had
no
idea
,
even
of
their
names
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
replaced
these
trinkets
,
the
Jew
took
out
another
:
so
small
that
*NL*
it
lay
in
the
palm
of
his
hand
.
There
seemed
to
be
some
very
minute
*NL*
inscription
on
it
;
for
the
Jew
laid
it
flat
upon
the
table
,
and
shading
*NL*
it
with
his
hand
,
pored
over
it
,
long
and
earnestly
.
At
length
he
put
*NL*
it
down
,
as
if
despairing
of
success
;
and
,
leaning
back
in
his
chair
,
*NL*
muttered
:
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
a
fine
thing
capital
punishment
is
!
Dead
men
never
repent
;
dead
*NL*
men
never
bring
awkward
stories
to
light
.
Ah
,
it
's
a
fine
thing
for
the
*NL*
trade
!
Five
of
'em
strung
up
in
a
row
,
and
none
left
to
play
booty
,
or
*NL*
turn
white-livered
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
Jew
uttered
these
words
,
his
bright
dark
eyes
,
which
had
been
*NL*
staring
vacantly
before
him
,
fell
on
Oliver
's
face
;
the
boy
's
eyes
were
*NL*
fixed
on
his
in
mute
curiousity
;
and
although
the
recognition
was
only
*NL*
for
an
instant
--
for
the
briefest
space
of
time
that
can
possibly
be
*NL*
conceived
--
it
was
enough
to
show
the
old
man
that
he
had
been
observed
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
closed
the
lid
of
the
box
with
a
loud
crash
;
and
,
laying
his
hand
on
*NL*
a
bread
knife
which
was
on
the
table
,
started
furiously
up
.
He
trembled
*NL*
very
much
though
;
for
,
even
in
his
terror
,
Oliver
could
see
that
the
*NL*
knife
quivered
in
the
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
's
that
?
'
said
the
Jew
.
`
What
do
you
watch
me
for
?
Why
are
you
*NL*
awake
?
What
have
you
seen
?
Speak
out
,
boy
!
Quick
--
quick
!
for
your
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
was
n't
able
to
sleep
any
longer
,
sir
,
'
replied
Oliver
,
meekly
.
'
I
am
*NL*
very
sorry
if
I
have
disturbed
you
,
sir
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
were
not
awake
an
hour
ago
?
'
said
the
Jew
,
scowling
fiercely
on
*NL*
the
boy
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
!
No
,
indeed
!
'
replied
Oliver
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Are
you
sure
?
'
cried
the
Jew
:
with
a
still
fiercer
look
than
before
:
*NL*
and
a
threatening
attitude
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Upon
my
word
I
was
not
,
sir
,
'
replied
Oliver
,
earnestly
.
'
I
was
not
,
*NL*
indeed
,
sir
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Tush
,
tush
,
my
dear
!
'
said
the
Jew
,
abruptly
resuming
his
old
manner
,
*NL*
and
playing
with
the
knife
a
little
,
before
he
laid
it
down
;
as
if
to
*NL*
induce
the
belief
that
he
had
caught
it
up
,
in
mere
sport
.
`
Of
course
I
*NL*
know
that
,
my
dear
.
I
only
tried
to
frighten
you
.
You
're
a
brave
boy
.
*NL*
Ha
!
ha
!
you
're
a
brave
boy
,
Oliver
.
'
The
Jew
rubbed
his
hands
with
a
*NL*
chuckle
,
but
glanced
uneasily
at
the
box
,
notwithstanding
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Did
you
see
any
of
these
pretty
things
,
my
dear
?
'
said
the
Jew
,
laying
*NL*
his
hand
upon
it
after
a
short
pause
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
sir
,
'
replied
Oliver
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ah
!
'
said
the
Jew
,
turning
rather
pale
.
`
They
--
they
're
mine
,
Oliver
;
*NL*
my
little
property
.
All
I
have
to
live
upon
,
in
my
old
age
.
The
folks
*NL*
call
me
a
miser
,
my
dear
.
Only
a
miser
;
that
's
all
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Oliver
thought
the
old
gentleman
must
be
a
decided
miser
to
live
in
*NL*
such
a
dirty
place
,
with
so
many
watches
;
but
,
thinking
that
perhaps
*NL*
his
fondness
for
the
Dodger
and
the
other
boys
,
cost
him
a
good
deal
of
*NL*
money
,
he
only
cast
a
deferential
look
at
the
Jew
,
and
asked
if
he
*NL*
might
get
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Certainly
,
my
dear
,
certainly
,
'
replied
the
old
gentleman
.
`
Stay
.
*NL*
There
's
a
pitcher
of
water
in
the
corner
by
the
door
.
Bring
it
here
;
*NL*
and
I
'll
give
you
a
basin
to
wash
in
,
my
dear
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Oliver
got
up
;
walked
across
the
room
;
and
stooped
for
an
instant
to
*NL*
raise
the
pitcher
.
When
he
turned
his
head
,
the
box
was
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
scarcely
washed
himself
,
and
made
everything
tidy
,
by
emptying
*NL*
the
basin
out
of
the
window
,
agreeably
to
the
Jew
's
directions
,
when
*NL*
the
Dodger
returned
:
accompanied
by
a
very
sprightly
young
friend
,
whom
*NL*
Oliver
had
seen
smoking
on
the
previous
night
,
and
who
was
now
formally
*NL*
introduced
to
him
as
Charley
Bates
.
The
four
sat
down
,
to
breakfast
,
on
*NL*
the
coffee
,
and
some
hot
rolls
and
ham
which
the
Dodger
had
brought
*NL*
home
in
the
crown
of
his
hat
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
'
said
the
Jew
,
glancing
slyly
at
Oliver
,
and
addressing
himself
*NL*
to
the
Dodger
,
'
I
hope
you
've
been
at
work
this
morning
,
my
dears
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Hard
,
'
replied
the
Dodger
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
As
nails
,
'
added
Charley
Bates
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Good
boys
,
good
boys
!
'
said
the
Jew
.
`
What
have
you
got
,
Dodger
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
A
couple
of
pocket-books
,
'
replied
that
young
gentlman
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Lined
?
'
inquired
the
Jew
,
with
eagerness
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Pretty
well
,
'
replied
the
Dodger
,
producing
two
pocket-books
;
one
*NL*
green
,
and
the
other
red
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Not
so
heavy
as
they
might
be
,
'
said
the
Jew
,
after
looking
at
the
*NL*
insides
carefully
;
`
but
very
neat
and
nicely
made
.
Ingenious
workman
,
*NL*
ai
n't
he
,
Oliver
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Very
indeed
,
sir
,
'
said
Oliver
.
At
which
Mr.
Charles
Bates
laughed
*NL*
uproariously
;
very
much
to
the
amazement
of
Oliver
,
who
saw
nothing
to
*NL*
laugh
at
,
in
anything
that
had
passed
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
what
have
you
got
,
my
dear
?
'
said
Fagin
to
Charley
Bates
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Wipes
,
'
replied
Master
Bates
;
at
the
same
time
producing
four
*NL*
pocket-handkerchiefs
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
'
said
the
Jew
,
inspecting
them
closely
;
`
they
're
very
good
ones
,
*NL*
very
.
You
have
n't
marked
them
well
,
though
,
Charley
;
so
the
marks
shall
*NL*
be
picked
out
with
a
needle
,
and
we
'll
teach
Oliver
how
to
do
it
.
Shall
*NL*
us
,
Oliver
,
eh
?
Ha
!
ha
!
ha
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
If
you
please
,
sir
,
'
said
Oliver
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
'd
like
to
be
able
to
make
pocket-handkerchiefs
as
easy
as
Charley
*NL*
Bates
,
would
n't
you
,
my
dear
?
'
said
the
Jew
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Very
much
,
indeed
,
if
you
'll
teach
me
,
sir
,
'
replied
Oliver
.
*NL*
*NL*
Master
Bates
saw
something
so
exquisitely
ludicrous
in
this
reply
,
that
*NL*
he
burst
into
another
laugh
;
which
laugh
,
meeting
the
coffee
he
was
*NL*
drinking
,
and
carrying
it
down
some
wrong
channel
,
very
nearly
*NL*
terminated
in
his
premature
suffocation
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
is
so
jolly
green
!
'
said
Charley
when
he
recovered
,
as
an
apology
*NL*
to
the
company
for
his
unpolite
behaviour
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Dodger
said
nothing
,
but
he
smoothed
Oliver
's
hair
over
his
eyes
,
*NL*
and
said
he
'd
know
better
,
by
and
by
;
upon
which
the
old
gentleman
,
*NL*
observing
Oliver
's
colour
mounting
,
changed
the
subject
by
asking
*NL*
whether
there
had
been
much
of
a
crowd
at
the
execution
that
morning
?
*NL*
This
made
him
wonder
more
and
more
;
for
it
was
plain
from
the
replies
*NL*
of
the
two
boys
that
they
had
both
been
there
;
and
Oliver
naturally
*NL*
wondered
how
they
could
possibly
have
found
time
to
be
so
very
*NL*
industrious
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
breakfast
was
cleared
away
;
the
merry
old
gentlman
and
the
two
*NL*
boys
played
at
a
very
curious
and
uncommon
game
,
which
was
performed
in
*NL*
this
way
.
The
merry
old
gentleman
,
placing
a
snuff-box
in
one
pocket
of
*NL*
his
trousers
,
a
note-case
in
the
other
,
and
a
watch
in
his
waistcoat
*NL*
pocket
,
with
a
guard-chain
round
his
neck
,
and
sticking
a
mock
diamond
*NL*
pin
in
his
shirt
:
buttoned
his
coat
tight
round
him
,
and
putting
his
*NL*
spectacle-case
and
handkerchief
in
his
pockets
,
trotted
up
and
down
the
*NL*
room
with
a
stick
,
in
imitation
of
the
manner
in
which
old
gentlemen
*NL*
walk
about
the
streets
any
hour
in
the
day
.
Sometimes
he
stopped
at
*NL*
the
fire-place
,
and
sometimes
at
the
door
,
making
believe
that
he
was
*NL*
staring
with
all
his
might
into
shop-windows
.
At
such
times
,
he
would
*NL*
look
constantly
round
him
,
for
fear
of
thieves
,
and
would
keep
slapping
*NL*
all
his
pockets
in
turn
,
to
see
that
he
had
n't
lost
anything
,
in
such
a
*NL*
very
funny
and
natural
manner
,
that
Oliver
laughed
till
the
tears
ran
*NL*
down
his
face
.
All
this
time
,
the
two
boys
followed
him
closely
about
:
*NL*
getting
out
of
his
sight
,
so
nimbly
,
every
time
he
turned
round
,
that
*NL*
it
was
impossible
to
follow
their
motions
.
At
last
,
the
Dodger
trod
*NL*
upon
his
toes
,
or
ran
upon
his
boot
accidently
,
while
Charley
Bates
*NL*
stumbled
up
against
him
behind
;
and
in
that
one
moment
they
took
from
*NL*
him
,
with
the
most
extraordinary
rapidity
,
snuff-box
,
note-case
,
*NL*
watch-guard
,
chain
,
shirt-pin
,
pocket-handkerchief
,
even
the
*NL*
spectacle-case
.
If
the
old
gentlman
felt
a
hand
in
any
one
of
his
*NL*
pockets
,
he
cried
out
where
it
was
;
and
then
the
game
began
all
over
*NL*
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
this
game
had
been
played
a
great
many
times
,
a
couple
of
young
*NL*
ladies
called
to
see
the
young
gentleman
;
one
of
whom
was
named
Bet
,
*NL*
and
the
other
Nancy
.
They
wore
a
good
deal
of
hair
,
not
very
neatly
*NL*
turned
up
behind
,
and
were
rather
untidy
about
the
shoes
and
stockings
.
*NL*
They
were
not
exactly
pretty
,
perhaps
;
but
they
had
a
great
deal
of
*NL*
colour
in
their
faces
,
and
looked
quite
stout
and
hearty
.
Being
*NL*
remarkably
free
and
agreeable
in
their
manners
,
Oliver
thought
them
*NL*
very
nice
girls
indeed
.
As
there
is
no
doubt
they
were
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
visitors
stopped
a
long
time
.
Spirits
were
produced
,
in
consequence
*NL*
of
one
of
the
young
ladies
complaining
of
a
coldness
in
her
inside
;
and
*NL*
the
conversation
took
a
very
convivial
and
improving
turn
.
At
length
,
*NL*
Charley
Bates
expressed
his
opinion
that
it
was
time
to
pad
the
hoof
.
*NL*
This
,
it
occurred
to
Oliver
,
must
be
French
for
going
out
;
for
directly
*NL*
afterwards
,
the
Dodger
,
and
Charley
,
and
the
two
young
ladies
,
went
*NL*
away
together
,
having
been
kindly
furnished
by
the
amiable
old
Jew
with
*NL*
money
to
spend
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
There
,
my
dear
,
'
said
Fagin
.
`
That
's
a
pleasant
life
,
is
n't
it
?
They
*NL*
have
gone
out
for
the
day
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Have
they
done
work
,
sir
?
'
inquired
Oliver
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
'
said
the
Jew
;
`
that
is
,
unless
they
should
unexpectedly
come
*NL*
across
any
,
when
they
are
out
;
and
they
wo
n't
neglect
it
,
if
they
do
,
*NL*
my
dear
,
depend
upon
it
.
Make
'em
your
models
,
my
dear
.
Make
'em
your
*NL*
models
,
'
tapping
the
fire-shovel
on
the
hearth
to
add
force
to
his
*NL*
words
;
`
do
everything
they
bid
you
,
and
take
their
advice
in
all
*NL*
matters
--
especially
the
Dodger
's
,
my
dear
.
He
'll
be
a
great
man
*NL*
himself
,
and
will
make
you
one
too
,
if
you
take
pattern
by
him
.
--
Is
my
*NL*
handkerchief
hanging
out
of
my
pocket
,
my
dear
?
'
said
the
Jew
,
stopping
*NL*
short
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
sir
,
'
said
Oliver
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
See
if
you
can
take
it
out
,
without
my
feeling
it
;
as
you
saw
them
do
,
*NL*
when
we
were
at
play
this
morning
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Oliver
held
up
the
bottom
of
the
pocket
with
one
hand
,
as
he
had
seen
*NL*
the
Dodger
hold
it
,
and
drew
the
handkerchief
lightly
out
of
it
with
*NL*
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Is
it
gone
?
'
cried
the
Jew
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Here
it
is
,
sir
,
'
said
Oliver
,
showing
it
in
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
're
a
clever
boy
,
my
dear
,
'
said
the
playful
old
gentleman
,
patting
*NL*
Oliver
on
the
head
approvingly
.
'
I
never
saw
a
sharper
lad
.
Here
's
a
*NL*
shilling
for
you
.
If
you
go
on
,
in
this
way
,
you
'll
be
the
greatest
man
*NL*
of
the
time
.
And
now
come
here
,
and
I
'll
show
you
how
to
take
the
marks
*NL*
out
of
the
handkerchiefs
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Oliver
wondered
what
picking
the
old
gentleman
's
pocket
in
play
,
had
to
*NL*
do
with
his
chances
of
being
a
great
man
.
But
,
thinking
that
the
Jew
,
*NL*
being
so
much
his
senior
,
must
know
best
,
he
followed
him
quietly
to
*NL*
the
table
,
and
was
soon
deeply
involved
in
his
new
study
.

CHAPTER
X
*NL*
*NL*
OLIVER
BECOMES
BETTER
ACQUAINTED
WITH
THE
CHARACTERS
OF
HIS
NEW
*NL*
ASSOCIATES
;
AND
PURCHASES
EXPERIENCE
AT
A
HIGH
PRICE
.
BEING
A
SHORT
,
*NL*
BUT
VERY
IMPORTANT
CHAPTER
,
IN
THIS
HISTORY
*NL*
*NL*
For
many
days
,
Oliver
remained
in
the
Jew
's
room
,
picking
the
marks
out
*NL*
of
the
pocket-handkerchief
,
-LRB-
of
which
a
great
number
were
brought
*NL*
home
,
-RRB-
and
sometimes
taking
part
in
the
game
already
described
:
which
*NL*
the
two
boys
and
the
Jew
played
,
regularly
,
every
morning
.
At
length
,
*NL*
he
began
to
languish
for
fresh
air
,
and
took
many
occasions
of
*NL*
earnestly
entreating
the
old
gentleman
to
allow
him
to
go
out
to
work
*NL*
with
his
two
companions
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oliver
was
rendered
the
more
anxious
to
be
actively
employed
,
by
what
*NL*
he
had
seen
of
the
stern
morality
of
the
old
gentleman
's
character
.
*NL*
Whenever
the
Dodger
or
Charley
Bates
came
home
at
night
,
empty-handed
,
*NL*
he
would
expatiate
with
great
vehemence
on
the
misery
of
idle
and
lazy
*NL*
habits
;
and
would
enforce
upon
them
the
necessity
of
an
active
life
,
by
*NL*
sending
them
supperless
to
bed
.
On
one
occasion
,
indeed
,
he
even
went
*NL*
so
far
as
to
knock
them
both
down
a
flight
of
stairs
;
but
this
was
*NL*
carrying
out
his
virtuous
precepts
to
an
unusual
extent
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
,
one
morning
,
Oliver
obtained
the
permission
he
had
so
*NL*
eagerly
sought
.
There
had
been
no
handkerchiefs
to
work
upon
,
for
two
*NL*
or
three
days
,
and
the
dinners
had
been
rather
meagre
.
Perhaps
these
*NL*
were
reasons
for
the
old
gentleman
's
giving
his
assent
;
but
,
whether
*NL*
they
were
or
no
,
he
told
Oliver
he
might
go
,
and
placed
him
under
the
*NL*
joint
guardianship
of
Charley
Bates
,
and
his
friend
the
Dodger
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
three
boys
sallied
out
;
the
Dodger
with
his
coat-sleeves
tucked
up
,
*NL*
and
his
hat
cocked
,
as
usual
;
Master
Bates
sauntering
along
with
his
*NL*
hands
in
his
pockets
;
and
Oliver
between
them
,
wondering
where
they
*NL*
were
going
,
and
what
branch
of
manufacture
he
would
be
instructed
in
,
*NL*
first
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
pace
at
which
they
went
,
was
such
a
very
lazy
,
ill-looking
saunter
,
*NL*
that
Oliver
soon
began
to
think
his
companions
were
going
to
deceive
*NL*
the
old
gentleman
,
by
not
going
to
work
at
all
.
The
Dodger
had
a
*NL*
vicious
propensity
,
too
,
of
pulling
the
caps
from
the
heads
of
small
*NL*
boys
and
tossing
them
down
areas
;
while
Charley
Bates
exhibited
some
*NL*
very
loose
notions
concerning
the
rights
of
property
,
by
pilfering
*NL*
divers
apples
and
onions
from
the
stalls
at
the
kennel
sides
,
and
*NL*
thrusting
them
into
pockets
which
were
so
surprisingly
capacious
,
that
*NL*
they
seemed
to
undermine
his
whole
suit
of
clothes
in
every
direction
.
*NL*
These
things
looked
so
bad
,
that
Oliver
was
on
the
point
of
declaring
*NL*
his
intention
of
seeking
his
way
back
,
in
the
best
way
he
could
;
when
*NL*
his
thoughts
were
suddenly
directed
into
another
channel
,
by
a
very
*NL*
mysterious
change
of
behaviour
on
the
part
of
the
Dodger
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
just
emerging
from
a
narrow
court
not
far
from
the
open
*NL*
square
in
Clerkenwell
,
which
is
yet
called
,
by
some
strange
perversion
*NL*
of
terms
,
`
The
Green
'
:
when
the
Dodger
made
a
sudden
stop
;
and
,
laying
*NL*
his
finger
on
his
lip
,
drew
his
companions
back
again
,
with
the
*NL*
greatest
caution
and
circumspection
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
's
the
matter
?
'
demanded
Oliver
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Hush
!
'
replied
the
Dodger
.
`
Do
you
see
that
old
cove
at
the
*NL*
book-stall
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
old
gentleman
over
the
way
?
'
said
Oliver
.
`
Yes
,
I
see
him
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
'll
do
,
'
said
the
Dodger
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
A
prime
plant
,
'
observed
Master
Charley
Bates
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oliver
looked
from
one
to
the
other
,
with
the
greatest
surprise
;
but
he
*NL*
was
not
permitted
to
make
any
inquiries
;
for
the
two
boys
walked
*NL*
stealthily
across
the
road
,
and
slunk
close
behind
the
old
gentleman
*NL*
towards
whom
his
attention
had
been
directed
.
Oliver
walked
a
few
paces
*NL*
after
them
;
and
,
not
knowing
whether
to
advance
or
retire
,
stood
*NL*
looking
on
in
silent
amazement
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
gentleman
was
a
very
respectable-looking
personage
,
with
a
*NL*
powdered
head
and
gold
spectacles
.
He
was
dressed
in
a
bottle-green
*NL*
coat
with
a
black
velvet
collar
;
wore
white
trousers
;
and
carried
a
*NL*
smart
bamboo
cane
under
his
arm
.
He
had
taken
up
a
book
from
the
stall
,
*NL*
and
there
he
stood
,
reading
away
,
as
hard
as
if
he
were
in
his
*NL*
elbow-chair
,
in
his
own
study
.
It
is
very
possible
that
he
fancied
*NL*
himself
there
,
indeed
;
for
it
was
plain
,
from
his
abstraction
,
that
he
*NL*
saw
not
the
book-stall
,
nor
the
street
,
nor
the
boys
,
nor
,
in
short
,
*NL*
anything
but
the
book
itself
:
which
he
was
reading
straight
through
:
*NL*
turning
over
the
leaf
when
he
got
to
the
bottom
of
a
page
,
beginning
at
*NL*
the
top
line
of
the
next
one
,
and
going
regularly
on
,
with
the
greatest
*NL*
interest
and
eagerness
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
was
Oliver
's
horror
and
alarm
as
he
stood
a
few
paces
off
,
looking
*NL*
on
with
his
eyelids
as
wide
open
as
they
would
possibly
go
,
to
see
the
*NL*
Dodger
plunge
his
hand
into
the
old
gentleman
's
pocket
,
and
draw
from
*NL*
thence
a
handkerchief
!
To
see
him
hand
the
same
to
Charley
Bates
;
and
*NL*
finally
to
behold
them
,
both
running
away
round
the
corner
at
full
*NL*
speed
!
*NL*
*NL*
In
an
instant
the
whole
mystery
of
the
hankerchiefs
,
and
the
watches
,
*NL*
and
the
jewels
,
and
the
Jew
,
rushed
upon
the
boy
's
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
stood
,
for
a
moment
,
with
the
blood
so
tingling
through
all
his
*NL*
veins
from
terror
,
that
he
felt
as
if
he
were
in
a
burning
fire
;
then
,
*NL*
confused
and
frightened
,
he
took
to
his
heels
;
and
,
not
knowing
what
he
*NL*
did
,
made
off
as
fast
as
he
could
lay
his
feet
to
the
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
all
done
in
a
minute
's
space
.
In
the
very
instant
when
Oliver
*NL*
began
to
run
,
the
old
gentleman
,
putting
his
hand
to
his
pocket
,
and
*NL*
missing
his
handkerchief
,
turned
sharp
round
.
Seeing
the
boy
scudding
*NL*
away
at
such
a
rapid
pace
,
he
very
naturally
concluded
him
to
be
the
*NL*
depredator
;
and
shouting
`
Stop
thief
!
'
with
all
his
might
,
made
off
*NL*
after
him
,
book
in
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
old
gentleman
was
not
the
only
person
who
raised
the
*NL*
hue-and-cry
.
The
Dodger
and
Master
Bates
,
unwilling
to
attract
public
*NL*
attention
by
running
down
the
open
street
,
had
merely
retired
into
the
*NL*
very
first
doorway
round
the
corner
.
They
no
sooner
heard
the
cry
,
and
*NL*
saw
Oliver
running
,
than
,
guessing
exactly
how
the
matter
stood
,
they
*NL*
issued
forth
with
great
promptitude
;
and
,
shouting
`
Stop
thief
!
'
too
,
*NL*
joined
in
the
pursuit
like
good
citizens
.
*NL*
*NL*
Although
Oliver
had
been
brought
up
by
philosophers
,
he
was
not
*NL*
theoretically
acquainted
with
the
beautiful
axiom
that
*NL*
self-preservation
is
the
first
law
of
nature
.
If
he
had
been
,
perhaps
*NL*
he
would
have
been
prepared
for
this
.
Not
being
prepared
,
however
,
it
*NL*
alarmed
him
the
more
;
so
away
he
went
like
the
wind
,
with
the
old
*NL*
gentleman
and
the
two
boys
roaring
and
shouting
behind
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Stop
thief
!
Stop
thief
!
'
There
is
a
magic
in
the
sound
.
The
tradesman
*NL*
leaves
his
counter
,
and
the
car-man
his
waggon
;
the
butcher
throws
down
*NL*
his
tray
;
the
baker
his
basket
;
the
milkman
his
pail
;
the
errand-boy
*NL*
his
parcels
;
the
school-boy
his
marbles
;
the
paviour
his
pickaxe
;
the
*NL*
child
his
battledore
.
Away
they
run
,
pell-mell
,
helter-skelter
,
*NL*
slap-dash
:
tearing
,
yelling
,
screaming
,
knocking
down
the
passengers
as
*NL*
they
turn
the
corners
,
rousing
up
the
dogs
,
and
astonishing
the
fowls
:
*NL*
and
streets
,
squares
,
and
courts
,
re-echo
with
the
sound
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Stop
thief
!
Stop
thief
!
'
The
cry
is
taken
up
by
a
hundred
voices
,
and
*NL*
the
crowd
accumulate
at
every
turning
.
Away
they
fly
,
splashing
through
*NL*
the
mud
,
and
rattling
along
the
pavements
:
up
go
the
windows
,
out
run
*NL*
the
people
,
onward
bear
the
mob
,
a
whole
audience
desert
Punch
in
the
*NL*
very
thickest
of
the
plot
,
and
,
joining
the
rushing
throng
,
swell
the
*NL*
shout
,
and
lend
fresh
vigour
to
the
cry
,
`
Stop
thief
!
Stop
thief
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Stop
thief
!
Stop
thief
!
'
There
is
a
passion
FOR
_
hunting
_
_
something
_
*NL*
deeply
implanted
in
the
human
breast
.
One
wretched
breathless
child
,
*NL*
panting
with
exhaustion
;
terror
in
his
looks
;
agony
in
his
eyes
;
large
*NL*
drops
of
perspiration
streaming
down
his
face
;
strains
every
nerve
to
*NL*
make
head
upon
his
pursuers
;
and
as
they
follow
on
his
track
,
and
gain
*NL*
upon
him
every
instant
,
they
hail
his
decreasing
strength
with
joy
.
*NL*
`
Stop
thief
!
'
Ay
,
stop
him
for
God
's
sake
,
were
it
only
in
mercy
!
*NL*
*NL*
Stopped
at
last
!
A
clever
blow
.
He
is
down
upon
the
pavement
;
and
the
*NL*
crowd
eagerly
gather
round
him
:
each
new
comer
,
jostling
and
*NL*
struggling
with
the
others
to
catch
a
glimpse
.
`
Stand
aside
!
'
`
Give
*NL*
him
a
little
air
!
'
`
Nonsense
!
he
do
n't
deserve
it
.
'
`
Where
's
the
*NL*
gentleman
?
'
`
Here
his
is
,
coming
down
the
street
.
'
`
Make
room
there
*NL*
for
the
gentleman
!
'
`
Is
this
the
boy
,
sir
!
'
`
Yes
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Oliver
lay
,
covered
with
mud
and
dust
,
and
bleeding
from
the
mouth
,
*NL*
looking
wildly
round
upon
the
heap
of
faces
that
surrounded
him
,
when
*NL*
the
old
gentleman
was
officiously
dragged
and
pushed
into
the
circle
by
*NL*
the
foremost
of
the
pursuers
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
'
said
the
gentleman
,
'
I
am
afraid
it
is
the
boy
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Afraid
!
'
murmured
the
crowd
.
`
That
's
a
good
`
un
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Poor
fellow
!
'
said
the
gentleman
,
`
he
has
hurt
himself
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
_
I
_
did
that
,
sir
,
'
said
a
great
lubberly
fellow
,
stepping
forward
;
*NL*
`
and
preciously
I
cut
my
knuckle
agin
'
his
mouth
.
I
stopped
him
,
sir
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
fellow
touched
his
hat
with
a
grin
,
expecting
something
for
his
*NL*
pains
;
but
,
the
old
gentleman
,
eyeing
him
with
an
expression
of
*NL*
dislike
,
look
anxiously
round
,
as
if
he
contemplated
running
away
*NL*
himself
:
which
it
is
very
possible
he
might
have
attempted
to
do
,
and
*NL*
thus
have
afforded
another
chase
,
had
not
a
police
officer
-LRB-
who
is
*NL*
generally
the
last
person
to
arrive
in
such
cases
-RRB-
at
that
moment
made
*NL*
his
way
through
the
crowd
,
and
seized
Oliver
by
the
collar
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Come
,
get
up
,
'
said
the
man
,
roughly
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
was
n't
me
indeed
,
sir
.
Indeed
,
indeed
,
it
was
two
other
boys
,
'
*NL*
said
Oliver
,
clasping
his
hands
passionately
,
and
looking
round
.
`
They
*NL*
are
here
somewhere
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
no
,
they
ai
n't
,
'
said
the
officer
.
He
meant
this
to
be
ironical
,
*NL*
but
it
was
true
besides
;
for
the
Dodger
and
Charley
Bates
had
filed
off
*NL*
down
the
first
convenient
court
they
came
to
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Come
,
get
up
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Do
n't
hurt
him
,
'
said
the
old
gentleman
,
compassionately
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
no
,
I
wo
n't
hurt
him
,
'
replied
the
officer
,
tearing
his
jacket
half
*NL*
off
his
back
,
in
proof
thereof
.
`
Come
,
I
know
you
;
it
wo
n't
do
.
Will
*NL*
you
stand
upon
your
legs
,
you
young
devil
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
Oliver
,
who
could
hardly
stand
,
made
a
shift
to
raise
himself
on
his
*NL*
feet
,
and
was
at
once
lugged
along
the
streets
by
the
jacket-collar
,
at
*NL*
a
rapid
pace
.
The
gentleman
walked
on
with
them
by
the
officer
's
side
;
*NL*
and
as
many
of
the
crowd
as
could
achieve
the
feat
,
got
a
little
ahead
,
*NL*
and
stared
back
at
Oliver
from
time
to
time
.
The
boys
shouted
in
*NL*
triumph
;
and
on
they
went
.

CHAPTER
XI
*NL*
*NL*
TREATS
OF
MR.
FANG
THE
POLICE
MAGISTRATE
;
AND
FURNISHES
A
SLIGHT
*NL*
SPECIMEN
OF
HIS
MODE
OF
ADMINISTERING
JUSTICE
*NL*
*NL*
The
offence
had
been
committed
within
the
district
,
and
indeed
in
the
*NL*
immediate
neighborhood
of
,
a
very
notorious
metropolitan
police
office
.
*NL*
The
crowd
had
only
the
satisfaction
of
accompanying
Oliver
through
two
*NL*
or
three
streets
,
and
down
a
place
called
Mutton
Hill
,
when
he
was
led
*NL*
beneath
a
low
archway
,
and
up
a
dirty
court
,
into
this
dispensary
of
*NL*
summary
justice
,
by
the
back
way
.
It
was
a
small
paved
yard
into
which
*NL*
they
turned
;
and
here
they
encountered
a
stout
man
with
a
bunch
of
*NL*
whiskers
on
his
face
,
and
a
bunch
of
keys
in
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
's
the
matter
now
?
'
said
the
man
carelessly
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
A
young
fogle-hunter
,
'
replied
the
man
who
had
Oliver
in
charge
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Are
you
the
party
that
's
been
robbed
,
sir
?
'
inquired
the
man
with
the
*NL*
keys
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
I
am
,
'
replied
the
old
gentleman
;
`
but
I
am
not
sure
that
this
*NL*
boy
actually
took
the
handkerchief
.
I
--
I
would
rather
not
press
the
*NL*
case
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Must
go
before
the
magistrate
now
,
sir
,
'
replied
the
man
.
`
His
worship
*NL*
will
be
disengaged
in
half
a
minute
.
Now
,
young
gallows
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
an
invitation
for
Oliver
to
enter
through
a
door
which
he
*NL*
unlocked
as
he
spoke
,
and
which
led
into
a
stone
cell
.
Here
he
was
*NL*
searched
;
and
nothing
being
found
upon
him
,
locked
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
cell
was
in
shape
and
size
something
like
an
area
cellar
,
only
not
*NL*
so
light
.
It
was
most
intolerably
dirty
;
for
it
was
Monday
morning
;
*NL*
and
it
had
been
tenanted
by
six
drunken
people
,
who
had
been
locked
up
,
*NL*
elsewhere
,
since
Saturday
night
.
But
this
is
little
.
In
our
*NL*
station-houses
,
men
and
women
are
every
night
confined
on
the
most
*NL*
trivial
charges
--
the
word
is
worth
noting
--
in
dungeons
,
compared
with
*NL*
which
,
those
in
Newgate
,
occupied
by
the
most
atrocious
felons
,
tried
,
*NL*
found
guilty
,
and
under
sentence
of
death
,
are
palaces
.
Let
any
one
who
*NL*
doubts
this
,
compare
the
two
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
gentleman
looked
almost
as
rueful
as
Oliver
when
the
key
grated
*NL*
in
the
lock
.
He
turned
with
a
sigh
to
the
book
,
which
had
been
the
*NL*
innocent
cause
of
all
this
disturbance
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
There
is
something
in
that
boy
's
face
,
'
said
the
old
gentleman
to
*NL*
himself
as
he
walked
slowly
away
,
tapping
his
chin
with
the
cover
of
*NL*
the
book
,
in
a
thoughtful
manner
;
`
something
that
touches
and
interests
*NL*
me
.
_
Can
_
he
be
innocent
?
He
looked
like
--
Bye
the
bye
,
'
exclaimed
the
*NL*
old
gentleman
,
halting
very
abruptly
,
and
staring
up
into
the
sky
,
*NL*
`
Bless
my
soul
!
--
where
have
I
seen
something
like
that
look
before
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
After
musing
for
some
minutes
,
the
old
gentleman
walked
,
with
the
same
*NL*
meditative
face
,
into
a
back
anteroom
opening
from
the
yard
;
and
there
,
*NL*
retiring
into
a
corner
,
called
up
before
his
mind
's
eye
a
vast
*NL*
amphitheatre
of
faces
over
which
a
dusky
curtain
had
hung
for
many
*NL*
years
.
`
No
,
'
said
the
old
gentleman
,
shaking
his
head
;
`
it
must
be
*NL*
imagination
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
wandered
over
them
again
.
He
had
called
them
into
view
,
and
it
was
*NL*
not
easy
to
replace
the
shroud
that
had
so
long
concealed
them
.
There
*NL*
were
the
faces
of
friends
,
and
foes
,
and
of
many
that
had
been
almost
*NL*
strangers
peering
intrusively
from
the
crowd
;
there
were
the
faces
of
*NL*
young
and
blooming
girls
that
were
now
old
women
;
there
were
faces
that
*NL*
the
grave
had
changed
and
closed
upon
,
but
which
the
mind
,
superior
to
*NL*
its
power
,
still
dressed
in
their
old
freshness
and
beauty
,
calling
*NL*
back
the
lustre
of
the
eyes
,
the
brightness
of
the
smile
,
the
beaming
*NL*
of
the
soul
through
its
mask
of
clay
,
and
whispering
of
beauty
beyond
*NL*
the
tomb
,
changed
but
to
be
heightened
,
and
taken
from
earth
only
to
be
*NL*
set
up
as
a
light
,
to
shed
a
soft
and
gentle
glow
upon
the
path
to
*NL*
Heaven
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
old
gentleman
could
recall
no
one
countenance
of
which
Oliver
's
*NL*
features
bore
a
trace
.
So
,
he
heaved
a
sigh
over
the
recollections
he
*NL*
awakened
;
and
being
,
happily
for
himself
,
an
absent
old
gentleman
,
*NL*
buried
them
again
in
the
pages
of
the
musty
book
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
roused
by
a
touch
on
the
shoulder
,
and
a
request
from
the
man
*NL*
with
the
keys
to
follow
him
into
the
office
.
He
closed
his
book
*NL*
hastily
;
and
was
at
once
ushered
into
the
imposing
presence
of
the
*NL*
renowned
Mr.
Fang
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
office
was
a
front
parlour
,
with
a
panelled
wall
.
Mr.
Fang
sat
*NL*
behind
a
bar
,
at
the
upper
end
;
and
on
one
side
the
door
was
a
sort
of
*NL*
wooden
pen
in
which
poor
little
Oliver
was
already
deposited
;
trembling
*NL*
very
much
at
the
awfulness
of
the
scene
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Fang
was
a
lean
,
long-backed
,
stiff-necked
,
middle-sized
man
,
with
*NL*
no
great
quantity
of
hair
,
and
what
he
had
,
growing
on
the
back
and
*NL*
sides
of
his
head
.
His
face
was
stern
,
and
much
flushed
.
If
he
were
*NL*
really
not
in
the
habit
of
drinking
rather
more
than
was
exactly
good
*NL*
for
him
,
he
might
have
brought
action
against
his
countenance
for
*NL*
libel
,
and
have
recovered
heavy
damages
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
gentleman
bowed
respectfully
;
and
advancing
to
the
magistrate
's
*NL*
desk
,
said
,
suiting
the
action
to
the
word
,
`
That
is
my
name
and
*NL*
address
,
sir
.
'
He
then
withdrew
a
pace
or
two
;
and
,
with
another
*NL*
polite
and
gentlemanly
inclination
of
the
head
,
waited
to
be
questioned
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
it
so
happened
that
Mr.
Fang
was
at
that
moment
perusing
a
leading
*NL*
article
in
a
newspaper
of
the
morning
,
adverting
to
some
recent
*NL*
decision
of
his
,
and
commending
him
,
for
the
three
hundred
and
fiftieth
*NL*
time
,
to
the
special
and
particular
notice
of
the
Secretary
of
State
*NL*
for
the
Home
Department
.
He
was
out
of
temper
;
and
he
looked
up
with
*NL*
an
angry

*NL*
`
Who
are
you
?
'
said
Mr.
Fang
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
gentleman
pointed
,
with
some
surprise
,
to
his
card
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Officer
!
'
said
Mr.
Fang
,
tossing
the
card
contemptuously
away
with
the
*NL*
newspaper
.
`
Who
is
this
fellow
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
My
name
,
sir
,
'
said
the
old
gentleman
,
speaking
_
like
_
a
gentleman
,
*NL*
`
my
name
,
sir
,
is
Brownlow
.
Permit
me
to
inquire
the
name
of
the
*NL*
magistrate
who
offers
a
gratuitous
and
unprovoked
insult
to
a
*NL*
respectable
person
,
under
the
protection
of
the
bench
.
'
Saying
this
,
*NL*
Mr.
Brownlow
looked
around
the
office
as
if
in
search
of
some
person
*NL*
who
would
afford
him
the
required
information
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Officer
!
'
said
Mr.
Fang
,
throwing
the
paper
on
one
side
,
`
what
's
this
*NL*
fellow
charged
with
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
's
not
charged
at
all
,
your
worship
,
'
replied
the
officer
.
`
He
*NL*
appears
against
this
boy
,
your
worship
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
His
worship
knew
this
perfectly
well
;
but
it
was
a
good
annoyance
,
and
*NL*
a
safe
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Appears
against
the
boy
,
does
he
?
'
said
Mr.
Fang
,
surveying
Mr.
*NL*
Brownlow
contemptuously
from
head
to
foot
.
`
Swear
him
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Before
I
am
sworn
,
I
must
beg
to
say
one
word
,
'
said
Mr.
Brownlow
;
*NL*
`
and
that
is
,
that
I
really
never
,
without
actual
experience
,
could
*NL*
have
believed
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Hold
your
tongue
,
sir
!
'
said
Mr.
Fang
,
peremptorily
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
will
not
,
sir
!
'
replied
the
old
gentleman
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Hold
your
tongue
this
instant
,
or
I
'll
have
you
turned
out
of
the
*NL*
office
!
'
said
Mr.
Fang
.
`
You
're
an
insolent
impertinent
fellow
.
How
*NL*
dare
you
bully
a
magistrate
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
!
'
exclaimed
the
old
gentleman
,
reddening
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Swear
this
person
!
'
said
Fang
to
the
clerk
.
`
I
'll
not
hear
another
*NL*
word
.
Swear
him
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Brownlow
's
indignation
was
greatly
roused
;
but
reflecting
perhaps
,
*NL*
that
he
might
only
injure
the
boy
by
giving
vent
to
it
,
he
suppressed
*NL*
his
feelings
and
submitted
to
be
sworn
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Now
,
'
said
Fang
,
`
what
's
the
charge
against
this
boy
?
What
have
you
*NL*
got
to
say
,
sir
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
was
standing
at
a
bookstall
--
'
Mr.
Brownlow
began
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Hold
your
tongue
,
sir
,
'
said
Mr.
Fang
.
`
Policeman
!
Where
's
the
*NL*
policeman
?
Here
,
swear
this
policeman
.
Now
,
policeman
,
what
is
this
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
policeman
,
with
becoming
humility
,
related
how
he
had
taken
the
*NL*
charge
;
how
he
had
searched
Oliver
,
and
found
nothing
on
his
person
;
*NL*
and
how
that
was
all
he
knew
about
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Are
there
any
witnesses
?
'
inquired
Mr.
Fang
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
None
,
your
worship
,
'
replied
the
policeman
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Fang
sat
silent
for
some
minutes
,
and
then
,
turning
round
to
the
*NL*
prosecutor
,
said
in
a
towering
passion
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Do
you
mean
to
state
what
your
complaint
against
this
boy
is
,
man
,
or
*NL*
do
you
not
?
You
have
been
sworn
.
Now
,
if
you
stand
there
,
refusing
to
*NL*
give
evidence
,
I
'll
punish
you
for
disrespect
to
the
bench
;
I
will
,
*NL*
by
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
By
what
,
or
by
whom
,
nobody
knows
,
for
the
clerk
and
jailor
coughed
*NL*
very
loud
,
just
at
the
right
moment
;
and
the
former
dropped
a
heavy
*NL*
book
upon
the
floor
,
thus
preventing
the
word
from
being
*NL*
heard
--
accidently
,
of
course
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
many
interruptions
,
and
repeated
insults
,
Mr.
Brownlow
contrived
*NL*
to
state
his
case
;
observing
that
,
in
the
surprise
of
the
moment
,
he
*NL*
had
run
after
the
boy
because
he
had
saw
him
running
away
;
and
*NL*
expressing
his
hope
that
,
if
the
magistrate
should
believe
him
,
*NL*
although
not
actually
the
thief
,
to
be
connected
with
the
thieves
,
he
*NL*
would
deal
as
leniently
with
him
as
justice
would
allow
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
has
been
hurt
already
,
'
said
the
old
gentleman
in
conclusion
.
`
And
*NL*
I
fear
,
'
he
added
,
with
great
energy
,
looking
towards
the
bar
,
'
I
*NL*
really
fear
that
he
is
ill
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
!
yes
,
I
dare
say
!
'
said
Mr.
Fang
,
with
a
sneer
.
`
Come
,
none
of
*NL*
your
tricks
here
,
you
young
vagabond
;
they
wo
n't
do
.
What
's
your
name
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
Oliver
tried
to
reply
but
his
tongue
failed
him
.
He
was
deadly
pale
;
*NL*
and
the
whole
place
seemed
turning
round
and
round
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
's
your
name
,
you
hardened
scoundrel
?
'
demanded
Mr.
Fang
.
*NL*
`
Officer
,
what
's
his
name
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
addressed
to
a
bluff
old
fellow
,
in
a
striped
waistcoat
,
who
*NL*
was
standing
by
the
bar
.
He
bent
over
Oliver
,
and
repeated
the
*NL*
inquiry
;
but
finding
him
really
incapable
of
understanding
the
*NL*
question
;
and
knowing
that
his
not
replying
would
only
infuriate
the
*NL*
magistrate
the
more
,
and
add
to
the
severity
of
his
sentence
;
he
*NL*
hazarded
a
guess
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
says
his
name
's
Tom
White
,
your
worship
,
'
said
the
kind-hearted
*NL*
thief-taker
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
,
he
wo
n't
speak
out
,
wo
n't
he
?
'
said
Fang
.
`
Very
well
,
very
well
.
*NL*
Where
does
he
live
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Where
he
can
,
your
worship
,
'
replied
the
officer
;
again
pretending
to
*NL*
receive
Oliver
's
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Has
he
any
parents
?
'
inquired
Mr.
Fang
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
says
they
died
in
his
infancy
,
your
worship
,
'
replied
the
officer
:
*NL*
hazarding
the
usual
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
point
of
the
inquiry
,
Oliver
raised
his
head
;
and
,
looking
*NL*
round
with
imploring
eyes
,
murmured
a
feeble
prayer
for
a
draught
of
*NL*
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Stuff
and
nonsense
!
'
said
Mr.
Fang
:
`
do
n't
try
to
make
a
fool
of
me
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
think
he
really
is
ill
,
your
worship
,
'
remonstrated
the
officer
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
know
better
,
'
said
Mr.
Fang
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Take
care
of
him
,
officer
,
'
said
the
old
gentleman
,
raising
his
hands
*NL*
instinctively
;
`
he
'll
fall
down
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Stand
away
,
officer
,
'
cried
Fang
;
`
let
him
,
if
he
likes
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Oliver
availed
himself
of
the
kind
permission
,
and
fell
to
the
floor
in
*NL*
a
fainting
fit
.
The
men
in
the
office
looked
at
each
other
,
but
no
one
*NL*
dared
to
stir
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
knew
he
was
shamming
,
'
said
Fang
,
as
if
this
were
incontestable
*NL*
proof
of
the
fact
.
`
Let
him
lie
there
;
he
'll
soon
be
tired
of
that
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
How
do
you
propose
to
deal
with
the
case
,
sir
?
'
inquired
the
clerk
in
*NL*
a
low
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Summarily
,
'
replied
Mr.
Fang
.
`
He
stands
committed
for
three
*NL*
months
--
hard
labour
of
course
.
Clear
the
office
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
door
was
opened
for
this
purpose
,
and
a
couple
of
men
were
*NL*
preparing
to
carry
the
insensible
boy
to
his
cell
;
when
an
elderly
man
*NL*
of
decent
but
poor
appearance
,
clad
in
an
old
suit
of
black
,
rushed
*NL*
hastily
into
the
office
,
and
advanced
towards
the
bench
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Stop
,
stop
!
do
n't
take
him
away
!
For
Heaven
's
sake
stop
a
moment
!
'
*NL*
cried
the
new
comer
,
breathless
with
haste
.
*NL*
*NL*
Although
the
presiding
Genii
in
such
an
office
as
this
,
exercise
a
*NL*
summary
and
arbitrary
power
over
the
liberties
,
the
good
name
,
the
*NL*
character
,
almost
the
lives
,
of
Her
Majesty
's
subjects
,
expecially
of
*NL*
the
poorer
class
;
and
although
,
within
such
walls
,
enough
fantastic
*NL*
tricks
are
daily
played
to
make
the
angels
blind
with
weeping
;
they
are
*NL*
closed
to
the
public
,
save
through
the
medium
of
the
daily
*NL*
press

Mr.
Fang
was
consequently
*NL*
not
a
little
indignant
to
see
an
unbidden
guest
enter
in
such
*NL*
irreverent
disorder
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What

*NL*
'
I

cried
the
man
;

all

Mr.

you

You
must
not

'
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
was
right
.
His
manner
was
determined
;
and
the
matter
was
*NL*
growing
rather
too
serious
to
be
hushed
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Swear
the
man
,
'
growled
Mr.
Fang
,
with
a
very
ill
grace
.
`
Now
,
man
,
*NL*
what
have
you
got
to
say
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
This
,
'
said
the
man
:
'
I
saw
three
boys
:
two
others
and
the
prisoner
*NL*
here
:
loitering
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
way
,
when
this
gentleman
*NL*
was
reading
.
The
robbery
was
committed
by
another
boy
.
I
saw
it
done
;
*NL*
and
I
saw
that
this
boy
was
perfectly
amazed
and
stupified
by
it
.
'
*NL*
Having
by
this
time
recovered
a
little
breath
,
the
worthy
book-stall
*NL*
keeper
proceeded
to
relate
,
in
a
more
coherent
manner
the
exact
*NL*
circumstances
of
the
robbery
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
did
n't
you
come
here
before
?
'
said
Fang
,
after
a
pause
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
had
n't
a
soul
to
mind
the
shop

'
replied
the
man
.
`
Everybody
who
*NL*
could
have
helped
me

had
joined
in
the
pursuit

I
could
get
nobody

five
minutes

I
've
run
here
all

*NL*
*NL*
`
The
prosecutor
was
reading

was
he
?

inquired
Fang
,
after
another
*NL*
pause
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes

'
replied
the
man
.
`
The
very
book
he
has
in
his
hand

'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh

that
book

eh

'
said
Fang
.
`
Is
it
paid
for
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No

it
is
not

'
replied
the
man
,
with
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Dear
me

I
forgot
all
about
it

exclaimed
the
absent
old
gentleman
,
*NL*
innocently
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
A
nice
person
to
prefer
a
charge
against
a
poor
boy
!
'
said
Fang
,
with
*NL*
a
comical
effort
to
look
humane
.
'
I
consider
,
sir
,
that
you
have
*NL*
obtained
possession
of
that
book
,
under
very
suspicious
and
*NL*
disreputable
circumstances
;
and
you
may
think
yourself
very
fortunate
*NL*
that
the
owner
of
the
property
declines
to
prosecute
.
Let
this
be
a
*NL*
lesson
to
you

overtake

discharged

*NL*
*NL*
'D

the

bursting
out
with
the
rage
he
had

kept
down
so
long

I

*NL*
*NL*

the

`
Officers

you
hear

Clear
*NL*
the
office

*NL*
*NL*
The
mandate
was
obeyed
;
and
the
indignant
Mr.
Brownlow
was
conveyed
*NL*
out
,
with
the
book
in
one
hand
,
and
the
bamboo
cane
in
the
other
:
in
a
*NL*
perfect
phrenzy
of
rage
and
defiance
.
He
reached
the
yard
;
and
his
*NL*
passion
vanished
in
a
moment
.
Little
Oliver
Twist
lay
on
his
back
on
*NL*
the
pavement
,
with
his
shirt
unbuttoned
,
and
his
temples
bathed
with
*NL*
water
;
his
face
a
deadly
white
;

a
cold
tremble
convulsing
his
whole
*NL*
frame

*NL*
*NL*
`
Poor

Mr.

bending
over
him

A

was
obtained

Oliver
having

laid

the

got
in

sat
himself
on

over
nearly
the
same
ground
as
that
which
*NL*
Oliver
had
traversed
when
he
first
entered
London
in
company
with
the
*NL*
Dodger
;
and
,
turning
a
different
way
when
it
reached
the
Angel
at
*NL*
Islington
,
stopped
at
length
before
a
neat
house
,
in
a
quiet
shady
*NL*
street
near
Pentonville
.
Here
,
a
bed
was
prepared
,
without
loss
of
*NL*
time
,
in
which
Mr.
Brownlow
saw
his
young
charge
carefully
and
*NL*
comfortably
deposited
;
and
here
,
he
was
tended
with
a
kindness
and
*NL*
solicitude
that
knew
no
bounds
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
for
many
days
,
Oliver
remained
insensible
to
all
the
goodness
of
*NL*
his
new
friends
.
The
sun
rose
and
sank
,
and
rose
and
sank
again
,
and
*NL*
many
times
after
that
;
and
still
the
boy
lay
stretched
on
his
uneasy
*NL*
bed
,
dwindling
away
beneath
the
dry
and
wasting
heat
of
fever
.
The
*NL*
worm
does
not
work
more
surely
on
the
dead
body
,
than
does
this
slow
*NL*
creeping
fire
upon
the
living
frame
.
*NL*
*NL*
Weak
,
and
thin
,
and
pallid
,
he
awoke
at
last
from
what
seemed
to
have
*NL*
been
a
long
and
troubled
dream
.
Feebly
raising
himself
in
the
bed
,
*NL*
with
his
head
resting
on
his
trembling
arm
,
he
looked
anxiously
around
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
room
is
this
?
Where
have
I
been
brought
to
?
'
said
Oliver
.
`
This
*NL*
is
not
the
place
I
went
to
sleep
in
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
uttered
these
words
in
a
feeble
voice
,
being
very
faint
and
weak
;
*NL*
but
they
were
overheard
at
once
.
The
curtain
at
the
bed
's
head
was
*NL*
hastily
drawn
back
,
and
a
motherly
old
lady
,
very
neatly
and
precisely
*NL*
dressed
,
rose
as
she
undrew
it
,
from
an
arm-chair
close
by
,
in
which
*NL*
she
had
been
sitting
at
needle-work
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Hush
,
my
dear
,
'
said
the
old
lady
softly
.
`
You
must
be
very
quiet
,
or
*NL*
you
will
be
ill
again
;
and
you
have
been
very
bad
,
--
as
bad
as
bad
could
*NL*
be
,
pretty
nigh
.
Lie
down
again
;
there
's
a
dear
!
'
With
those
words
,
*NL*
the
old
lady
very
gently
placed
Oliver
's
head
upon
the
pillow
;
and
,
*NL*
smoothing
back
his
hair
from
his
forehead
,
looked
so
kindly
and
loving
*NL*
in
his
face
,
that
he
could
not
help
placing
his
little
withered
hand
in
*NL*
hers
,
and
drawing
it
round
his
neck
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Save
us
!
'
said
the
old
lady
,
with
tears
in
her
eyes
.
`
What
a
grateful
*NL*
little
dear
it
is
.
Pretty
creetur
!
What
would
his
mother
feel
if
she
*NL*
had
sat
by
him
as
I
have
,
and
could
see
him
now
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Perhaps
she
does
see
me
,
'
whispered
Oliver
,
folding
his
hands
*NL*
together
;
`
perhaps
she
has
sat
by
me
.
I
almost
feel
as
if
she
had
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
was
the
fever
,
my
dear
,
'
said
the
old
lady
mildly
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
suppose
it
was
,
'
replied
Oliver
,
`
because
heaven
is
a
long
way
off
;
*NL*
and
they
are
too
happy
there
,
to
come
down
to
the
bedside
of
a
poor
*NL*
boy
.
But
if
she
knew
I
was
ill
,
she
must
have
pitied
me
,
even
there
;
*NL*
for
she
was
very
ill
herself
before
she
died
.
She
ca
n't
know
anything
*NL*
about
me
though
,
'
added
Oliver
after
a
moment
's
silence
.
`
If
she
had
*NL*
seen
me
hurt
,
it
would
have
made
her
sorrowful
;
and
her
face
has
always
*NL*
looked
sweet
and
happy
,
when
I
have
dreamed
of
her
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
lady
made
no
reply
to
this
;
but
wiping
her
eyes
first
,
and
her
*NL*
spectacles
,
which
lay
on
the
counterpane
,
afterwards
,
as
if
they
were
*NL*
part
and
parcel
of
those
features
,
brought
some
cool
stuff
for
Oliver
*NL*
to
drink
;
and
then
,
patting
him
on
the
cheek
,
told
him
he
must
lie
very
*NL*
quiet
,
or
he
would
be
ill
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
,
Oliver
kept
very
still
;
partly
because
he
was
anxious
to
obey
the
*NL*
kind
old
lady
in
all
things
;
and
partly
,
to
tell
the
truth
,
because
he
*NL*
was
completely
exhausted
with
what
he
had
already
said
.
He
soon
fell
*NL*
into
a
gentle
doze
,
from
which
he
was
awakened
by
the
light
of
a
*NL*
candle
:
which
,
being
brought
near
the
bed
,
showed
him
a
gentleman
with
*NL*
a
very
large
and
loud-ticking
gold
watch
in
his
hand
,
who
felt
his
*NL*
pulse
,
and
said
he
was
a
great
deal
better
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
_
are
_
a
great
deal
better
,
are
you
not
,
my
dear
?
'
said
the
*NL*
gentleman
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
thank
you
,
sir
,
'
replied
Oliver
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
I
know
you
are
,
'
said
the
gentleman
:
`
You
're
hungry
too
,
a
n't
*NL*
you
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
sir
,
'
answered
Oliver
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Hem
!
'
said
the
gentleman
.
`
No
,
I
know
you
're
not
.
He
is
not
hungry
,
*NL*
Mrs.
Bedwin
,
'
said
the
gentleman
:
looking
very
wise
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
lady
made
a
respectful
inclination
of
the
head
,
which
seemed
to
*NL*
say
that
she
thought
the
doctor
was
a
very
clever
man
.
The
doctor
*NL*
appeared
much
of
the
same
opinion
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
feel
sleepy
,
do
n't
you
,
my
dear
?
'
said
the
doctor
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
sir
,
'
replied
Oliver
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
'
said
the
doctor
,
with
a
very
shrewd
and
satisfied
look
.
`
You
're
*NL*
not
sleepy
.
Nor
thirsty
.
Are
you
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
sir
,
rather
thirsty
,
'
answered
Oliver
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Just
as
I
expected
,
Mrs.
Bedwin
,
'
said
the
doctor
.
`
It
's
very
natural
*NL*
that
he
should
be
thirsty
.
You
may
give
him
a
little
tea
,
ma'am
,
and
*NL*
some
dry
toast
without
any
butter
.
Do
n't
keep
him
too
warm
,
ma'am
;
but
*NL*
be
careful
that
you
do
n't
let
him
be
too
cold
;
will
you
have
the
*NL*
goodness
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
lady
dropped
a
curtsey
.
The
doctor
,
after
tasting
the
cool
*NL*
stuff
,
and
expressing
a
qualified
approval
of
it
,
hurried
away
:
his
*NL*
boots
creaking
in
a
very
important
and
wealthy
manner
as
he
went
*NL*
downstairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oliver
dozed
off
again
,
soon
after
this
;
when
he
awoke
,
it
was
nearly
*NL*
twelve
o'clock
.
The
old
lady
tenderly
bade
him
good-night
shortly
*NL*
afterwards
,
and
left
him
in
charge
of
a
fat
old
woman
who
had
just
*NL*
come
:
bringing
with
her
,
in
a
little
bundle
,
a
small
Prayer
Book
and
a
*NL*
large
nightcap
.
Putting
the
latter
on
her
head
and
the
former
on
the
*NL*
table
,
the
old
woman
,
after
telling
Oliver
that
she
had
come
to
sit
up
*NL*
with
him
,
drew
her
chair
close
to
the
fire
and
went
off
into
a
series
*NL*
of
short
naps
,
chequered
at
frequent
intervals
with
sundry
tumblings
*NL*
forward
,
and
divers
moans
and
chokings
.
These
,
however
,
had
no
worse
*NL*
effect
than
causing
her
to
rub
her
nose
very
hard
,
and
then
fall
asleep
*NL*
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
thus
the
night
crept
slowly
on
.
Oliver
lay
awake
for
some
time
,
*NL*
counting
the
little
circles
of
light
which
the
reflection
of
the
*NL*
rushlight-shade
threw
upon
the
ceiling
;
or
tracing
with
his
languid
*NL*
eyes
the
intricate
pattern
of
the
paper
on
the
wall
.
The
darkness
and
*NL*
the
deep
stillness
of
the
room
were
very
solemn
;
as
they
brought
into
*NL*
the
boy
's
mind
the
thought
that
death
had
been
hovering
there
,
for
many
*NL*
days
and
nights
,
and
might
yet
fill
it
with
the
gloom
and
dread
of
his
*NL*
awful
presence
,
he
turned
his
face
upon
the
pillow
,
and
fervently
*NL*
prayed
to
Heaven
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gradually
,
he
fell
into
that
deep
tranquil
sleep
which
ease
from
recent
*NL*
suffering
alone
imparts
;
that
calm
and
peaceful
rest
which
it
is
pain
*NL*
to
wake
from
.
Who
,
if
this
were
death
,
would
be
roused
again
to
all
*NL*
the
struggles
and
turmoils
of
life
;
to
all
its
cares
for
the
present
;
*NL*
its
anxieties
for
the
future
;
more
than
all
,
its
weary
recollections
of
*NL*
the
past
!
*NL*
*NL*
It
had
been
bright
day
,
for
hours
,
when
Oliver
opened
his
eyes
;
he
felt
*NL*
cheerful
and
happy
.
The
crisis
of
the
disease
was
safely
past
.
He
*NL*
belonged
to
the
world
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
three
days
'
time
he
was
able
to
sit
in
an
easy-chair
,
well
propped
*NL*
up
with
pillows
;
and
,
as
he
was
still
too
weak
to
walk
,
Mrs.
Bedwin
had
*NL*
him
carried
downstairs
into
the
little
housekeeper
's
room
,
which
*NL*
belonged
to
her
.
Having
him
set
,
here
,
by
the
fire-side
,
the
good
old
*NL*
lady
sat
herself
down
too
;
and
,
being
in
a
state
of
considerable
*NL*
delight
at
seeing
him
so
much
better
,
forthwith
began
to
cry
most
*NL*
violently
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Never
mind
me
,
my
dear
,
'
said
the
old
lady
;
`
I
'm
only
having
a
regular
*NL*
good
cry
.
There
;
it
's
all
over
now
;
and
I
'm
quite
comfortable
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
're
very
,
very
kind
to
me
,
ma'am
,
'
said
Oliver
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
never
you
mind
that
,
my
dear
,
'
said
the
old
lady
;
`
that
's
got
*NL*
nothing
to
do
with
your
broth
;
and
it
's
full
time
you
had
it
;
for
the
*NL*
doctor
says
Mr.
Brownlow
may
come
in
to
see
you
this
morning
;
and
we
*NL*
must
get
up
our
best
looks
,
because
the
better
we
look
,
the
more
he
'll
*NL*
be
pleased
.
'
And
with
this
,
the
old
lady
applied
herself
to
warming
*NL*
up
,
in
a
little
saucepan
,
a
basin
full
of
broth
:
strong
enough
,
Oliver
*NL*
thought
,
to
furnish
an
ample
dinner
,
when
reduced
to
the
regulation
*NL*
strength
,
for
three
hundred
and
fifty
paupers
,
at
the
lowest
*NL*
computation
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Are
you
fond
of
pictures
,
dear
?
'
inquired
the
old
lady
,
seeing
that
*NL*
Oliver
had
fixed
his
eyes
,
most
intently
,
on
a
portrait
which
hung
*NL*
against
the
wall
;
just
opposite
his
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
do
n't
quite
know
,
ma'am
,
'
said
Oliver
,
without
taking
his
eyes
from
*NL*
the
canvas
;
'
I
have
seen
so
few
that
I
hardly
know
.
What
a
beautiful
,
*NL*
mild
face
that
lady
's
is
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ah
!
'
said
the
old
lady
,
`
painters
always
make
ladies
out
prettier
than
*NL*
they
are
,
or
they
would
n't
get
any
custom
,
child
.
The
man
that
invented
*NL*
the
machine
for
taking
likenesses
might
have
known
that
would
never
*NL*
succeed
;
it
's
a
deal
too
honest
.
A
deal
,
'
said
the
old
lady
,
laughing
*NL*
very
heartily
at
her
own
acuteness
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Is
--
is
that
a
likeness
,
ma'am
?
'
said
Oliver
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
'
said
the
old
lady
,
looking
up
for
a
moment
from
the
broth
;
*NL*
`
that
's
a
portrait
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Whose
,
ma'am
?
'
asked
Oliver
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
really
,
my
dear
,
I
do
n't
know
,
'
answered
the
old
lady
in
a
*NL*
good-humoured
manner
.
`
It
's
not
a
likeness
of
anybody
that
you
or
I
*NL*
know
,
I
expect
.
It
seems
to
strike
your
fancy
,
dear
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
is
so
pretty
,
'
replied
Oliver
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
sure
you
're
not
afraid
of
it
?
'
said
the
old
lady
:
observing
in
*NL*
great
surprise
,
the
look
of
awe
with
which
the
child
regarded
the
*NL*
painting
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
no
,
no
,
'
returned
Oliver
quickly
;
`
but
the
eyes
look
so
sorrowful
;
*NL*
and
where
I
sit
,
they
seem
fixed
upon
me
.
It
makes
my
heart
beat
,
'
*NL*
added
Oliver
in
a
low
voice
,
`
as
if
it
was
alive
,
and
wanted
to
speak
*NL*
to
me
,
but
could
n't
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Lord
save
us
!
'
exclaimed
the
old
lady
,
starting
;
`
do
n't
talk
in
that
*NL*
way
,
child
.
You
're
weak
and
nervous
after
your
illness
.
Let
me
wheel
*NL*
your
chair
round
to
the
other
side
;
and
then
you
wo
n't
see
it
.
There
!
'
*NL*
said
the
old
lady
,
suiting
the
action
to
the
word
;
`
you
do
n't
see
it
*NL*
now
,
at
all
events
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Oliver
_
did
_
see
it
in
his
mind
's
eye
as
distinctly
as
if
he
had
not
*NL*
altered
his
position
;
but
he
thought
it
better
not
to
worry
the
kind
*NL*
old
lady
;
so
he
smiled
gently
when
she
looked
at
him
;
and
Mrs.
Bedwin
,
*NL*
satisfied
that
he
felt
more
comfortable
,
salted
and
broke
bits
of
*NL*
toasted
bread
into
the
broth
,
with
all
the
bustle
befitting
so
solemn
a
*NL*
preparation
.
Oliver
got
through
it
with
extraordinary
expedition
.
He
*NL*
had
scarcely
swallowed
the
last
spoonful
,
when
there
came
a
soft
rap
at
*NL*
the
door
.
`
Come
in
,
'
said
the
old
lady
;
and
in
walked
Mr.
Brownlow
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
the
old
gentleman
came
in
as
brisk
as
need
be
;
but
,
he
had
no
*NL*
sooner
raised
his
spectacles
on
his
forehead
,
and
thrust
his
hands
*NL*
behind
the
skirts
of
his
dressing-gown
to
take
a
good
long
look
at
*NL*
Oliver
,
than
his
countenance
underwent
a
very
great
variety
of
odd
*NL*
contortions
.
Oliver
looked
very
worn
and
shadowy
from
sickness
,
and
*NL*
made
an
ineffectual
attempt
to
stand
up
,
out
of
respect
to
his
*NL*
benefactor
,
which
terminated
in
his
sinking
back
into
the
chair
again
;
*NL*
and
the
fact
is
,
if
the
truth
must
be
told
,
that
Mr.
Brownlow
's
heart
,
*NL*
being
large
enough
for
any
six
ordinary
old
gentlemen
of
humane
*NL*
disposition
,
forced
a
supply
of
tears
into
his
eyes
,
by
some
hydraulic
*NL*
process
which
we
are
not
sufficiently
philosophical
to
be
in
a
*NL*
condition
to
explain
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Poor
boy
,
poor
boy
!
'
said
Mr.
Brownlow
,
clearing
his
throat
.
`
I
'm
*NL*
rather
hoarse
this
morning
,
Mrs.
Bedwin
.
I
'm
afraid
I
have
caught
*NL*
cold
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
hope
not
,
sir
,
'
said
Mrs.
Bedwin
.
`
Everything
you
have
had
,
has
*NL*
been
well
aired
,
sir
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
do
n't
know
,
Bedwin
.
I
do
n't
know
,
'
said
Mr.
Brownlow
;
'
I
rather
*NL*
think
I
had
a
damp
napkin
at
dinner-time
yesterday
;
but
never
mind
*NL*
that
.
How
do
you
feel
,
my
dear
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Very
happy
,
sir
,
'
replied
Oliver
.
`
And
very
grateful
indeed
,
sir
,
for
*NL*
your
goodness
to
me
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Good
by
,
'
said
Mr.
Brownlow
,
stoutly
.
`
Have
you
given
him
any
*NL*
nourishment
,
Bedwin
?
Any
slops
,
eh
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
has
just
had
a
basin
of
beautiful
strong
broth
,
sir
,
'
replied
Mrs.
*NL*
Bedwin
:
drawing
herself
up
slightly
,
and
laying
strong
emphasis
on
the
*NL*
last
word
:
to
intimate
that
between
slops
,
and
broth
will
compounded
,
*NL*
there
existed
no
affinity
or
connection
whatsoever
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ugh
!
'
said
Mr.
Brownlow
,
with
a
slight
shudder
;
'
a
couple
of
glasses
*NL*
of
port
wine
would
have
done
him
a
great
deal
more
good
.
Would
n't
they
,
*NL*
Tom
White
,
eh
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
My
name
is
Oliver
,
sir
,
'
replied
the
little
invalid
:
with
a
look
of
*NL*
great
astonishment
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oliver
,
'
said
Mr.
Brownlow
;
`
Oliver
what
?
Oliver
White
,
eh
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
sir
,
Twist
,
Oliver
Twist
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Queer
name
!
'
said
the
old
gentleman
.
`
What
made
you
tell
the
*NL*
magistrate
your
name
was
White
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
never
told
him
so
,
sir
,
'
returned
Oliver
in
amazement
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
sounded
so
like
a
falsehood
,
that
the
old
gentleman
looked
*NL*
somewhat
sternly
in
Oliver
's
face
.
It
was
impossible
to
doubt
him
;
*NL*
there
was
truth
in
every
one
of
its
thin
and
sharpened
lineaments
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Some
mistake
,
'
said
Mr.
Brownlow
.
But
,
although
his
motive
for
*NL*
looking
steadily
at
Oliver
no
longer
existed
,
the
old
idea
of
the
*NL*
resemblance
between
his
features
and
some
familiar
face
came
upon
him
*NL*
so
strongly
,
that
he
could
not
withdraw
his
gaze
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
hope
you
are
not
angry
with
me
,
sir
?
'
said
Oliver
,
raising
his
eyes
*NL*
beseechingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
no
,
'
replied
the
old
gentleman
.
`
Why
!
what
's
this
?
Bedwin
,
look
*NL*
there
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
spoke
,
he
pointed
hastily
to
the
picture
over
Oliver
's
head
,
and
*NL*
then
to
the
boy
's
face
.
There
was
its
living
copy
.
The
eyes
,
the
head
,
*NL*
the
mouth
;
every
feature
was
the
same
.
The
expression
was
,
for
the
*NL*
instant
,
so
precisely
alike
,
that
the
minutest
line
seemed
copied
with
*NL*
startling
accuracy
!
*NL*
*NL*
Oliver
knew
not
the
cause
of
this
sudden
exclamation
;
for
,
not
being
*NL*
strong
enough
to
bear
the
start
it
gave
him
,
he
fainted
away
.
A
*NL*
weakness
on
his
part
,
which
affords
the
narrative
an
opportunity
of
*NL*
relieving
the
reader
from
suspense
,
in
behalf
of
the
two
young
pupils
*NL*
of
the
Merry
Old
Gentleman
;
and
of
recording
--
*NL*
*NL*
That
when
the
Dodger
,
and
his
accomplished
friend
Master
Bates
,
joined
*NL*
in
the
hue-and-cry
which
was
raised
at
Oliver
's
heels
,
in
consequence
*NL*
of
their
executing
an
illegal
conveyance
of
Mr.
Brownlow
's
personal
*NL*
property
,
as
has
been
already
described
,
they
were
actuated
by
a
very
*NL*
laudable
and
becoming
regard
for
themselves
;
and
forasmuch
as
the
*NL*
freedom
of
the
subject
and
the
liberty
of
the
individual
are
among
the
*NL*
first
and
proudest
boasts
of
a
true-hearted
Englishman
,
so
,
I
need
*NL*
hardly
beg
the
reader
to
observe
,
that
this
action
should
tend
to
exalt
*NL*
them
in
the
opinion
of
all
public
and
patriotic
men
,
in
almost
as
great
*NL*
a
degree
as
this
strong
proof
of
their
anxiety
for
their
own
*NL*
preservation
and
safety
goes
to
corroborate
and
confirm
the
little
code
*NL*
of
laws
which
certain
profound
and
sound-judging
philosophers
have
laid
*NL*
down
as
the
main-springs
of
all
Nature
's
deeds
and
actions
:
the
said
*NL*
philosophers
very
wisely
reducing
the
good
lady
's
proceedings
to
*NL*
matters
of
maxim
and
theory
:
and
,
by
a
very
neat
and
pretty
compliment
*NL*
to
her
exalted
wisdom
and
understanding
,
putting
entirely
out
of
sight
*NL*
any
considerations
of
heart
,
or
generous
impulse
and
feeling
.
For
,
*NL*
these
are
matters
totally
beneath
a
female
who
is
acknowledged
by
*NL*
universal
admission
to
be
far
above
the
numerous
little
foibles
and
*NL*
weaknesses
of
her
sex
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
I
wanted
any
further
proof
of
the
strictly
philosophical
nature
of
*NL*
the
conduct
of
these
young
gentlemen
in
their
very
delicate
*NL*
predicament
,
I
should
at
once
find
it
in
the
fact
-LRB-
also
recorded
in
a
*NL*
foregoing
part
of
this
narrative
-RRB-
,
of
their
quitting
the
pursuit
,
when
*NL*
the
general
attention
was
fixed
upon
Oliver
;
and
making
immediately
for
*NL*
their
home
by
the
shortest
possible
cut
.
Although
I
do
not
mean
to
*NL*
assert
that
it
is
usually
the
practice
of
renowned
and
learned
sages
,
*NL*
to
shorten
the
road
to
any
great
conclusion
-LRB-
their
course
indeed
being
*NL*
rather
to
lengthen
the
distance
,
by
various
circumlocutions
and
*NL*
discursive
staggerings
,
like
unto
those
in
which
drunken
men
under
the
*NL*
pressure
of
a
too
mighty
flow
of
ideas
,
are
prone
to
indulge
-RRB-
;
still
,
I
*NL*
do
mean
to
say
,
and
do
say
distinctly
,
that
it
is
the
invariable
*NL*
practice
of
many
mighty
philosophers
,
in
carrying
out
their
theories
,
*NL*
to
evince
great
wisdom
and
foresight
in
providing
against
every
*NL*
possible
contingency
which
can
be
supposed
at
all
likely
to
affect
*NL*
themselves
.
Thus
,
to
do
a
great
right
,
you
may
do
a
little
wrong
;
and
*NL*
you
may
take
any
means
which
the
end
to
be
attained
,
will
justify
;
the
*NL*
amount
of
the
right
,
or
the
amount
of
the
wrong
,
or
indeed
the
*NL*
distinction
between
the
two
,
being
left
entirely
to
the
philosopher
*NL*
concerned
,
to
be
settled
and
determined
by
his
clear
,
comprehensive
,
*NL*
and
impartial
view
of
his
own
particular
case
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
until
the
two
boys
had
scoured
,
with
great
rapidity
,
through
*NL*
a
most
intricate
maze
of
narrow
streets
and
courts
,
that
they
ventured
*NL*
to
halt
beneath
a
low
and
dark
archway
.
Having
remained
silent
here
,
*NL*
just
long
enough
to
recover
breath
to
speak
,
Master
Bates
uttered
an
*NL*
exclamation
of
amusement
and
delight
;
and
,
bursting
into
an
*NL*
uncontrollable
fit
of
laughter
,
flung
himself
upon
a
doorstep
,
and
*NL*
rolled
thereon
in
a
transport
of
mirth
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
's
the
matter
?
'
inquired
the
Dodger
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ha
!
ha
!
ha
!
'
roared
Charley
Bates
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Hold
your
noise
,
'
remonstrated
the
Dodger
,
looking
cautiously
round
.
*NL*
`
Do
you
want
to
be
grabbed
,
stupid
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
ca
n't
help
it
,
'
said
Charley
,
'
I
ca
n't
help
it
!
To
see
him
*NL*
splitting
away
at
that
pace
,
and
cutting
round
the
corners
,
and
*NL*
knocking
up
again
'
the
posts
,
and
starting
on
again
as
if
he
was
made
*NL*
of
iron
as
well
as
them
,
and
me
with
the
wipe
in
my
pocket
,
singing
out
*NL*
arter
him
--
oh
,
my
eye
!
'
The
vivid
imagination
of
Master
Bates
presented
*NL*
the
scene
before
him
in
too
strong
colours
.
As
he
arrived
at
this
*NL*
apostrophe
,
he
again
rolled
upon
the
door-step
,
and
laughed
louder
than
*NL*
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
'll
Fagin
say
?
'
inquired
the
Dodger
;
taking
advantage
of
the
next
*NL*
interval
of
breathlessness
on
the
part
of
his
friend
to
propound
the
*NL*
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
?
'
repeated
Charley
Bates
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ah
,
what
?
'
said
the
Dodger
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
what
should
he
say
?
'
inquired
Charley
:
stopping
rather
suddenly
*NL*
in
his
merriment
;
for
the
Dodger
's
manner
was
impressive
.
`
What
should
*NL*
he
say
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Dawkins
whistled
for
a
couple
of
minutes
;
then
,
taking
off
his
hat
,
*NL*
scratched
his
head
,
and
nodded
thrice
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
do
you
mean
?
'
said
Charley
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Toor
rul
lol
loo
,
gammon
and
spinnage
,
the
frog
he
would
n't
,
and
high
*NL*
cockolorum
,
'
said
the
Dodger
:
with
a
slight
sneer
on
his
intellectual
*NL*
countenance
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
explanatory
,
but
not
satisfactory
.
Master
Bates
felt
it
so
;
*NL*
and
again
said
,
`
What
do
you
mean
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
Dodger
made
no
reply
;
but
putting
his
hat
on
again
,
and
gathering
*NL*
the
skirts
of
his
long-tailed
coat
under
his
arm
,
thrust
his
tongue
*NL*
into
his
cheek
,
slapped
the
bridge
of
his
nose
some
half-dozen
times
in
*NL*
a
familiar
but
expressive
manner
,
and
turning
on
his
heel
,
slunk
down
*NL*
the
court
.
Master
Bates
followed
,
with
a
thoughtful
countenance
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
noise
of
footsteps
on
the
creaking
stairs
,
a
few
minutes
after
the
*NL*
occurrence
of
this
conversation
,
roused
the
merry
old
gentleman
as
he
*NL*
sat
over
the
fire
with
a
saveloy
and
a
small
loaf
in
his
hand
;
a
*NL*
pocket-knife
in
his
right
;
and
a
pewter
pot
on
the
trivet
.
There
was
a
*NL*
rascally
smile
on
his
white
face
as
he
turned
round
,
and
looking
*NL*
sharply
out
from
under
his
thick
red
eyebrows
,
bent
his
ear
towards
the
*NL*
door
,
and
listened
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
how
's
this
?
'
muttered
the
Jew
:
changing
countenance
;
`
only
two
*NL*
of
'em
?
Where
's
the
third
?
They
ca
n't
have
got
into
trouble
.
Hark
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
footsteps
approached
nearer
;
they
reached
the
landing
.
The
door
was
*NL*
slowly
opened
;
and
the
Dodger
and
Charley
Bates
entered
,
closing
it
*NL*
behind
them
.

CHAPTER
XIII
*NL*
*NL*
SOME
NEW
ACQUAINTANCES
ARE
INTRODUCED
TO
THE
INTELLIGENT
READER
,
*NL*
CONNECTED
WITH
WHOM
VARIOUS
PLEASANT
MATTERS
ARE
RELATED
,
APPERTAINING
*NL*
TO
THIS
HISTORY
*NL*
*NL*
`
Where
's
Oliver
?
'
said
the
Jew
,
rising
with
a
menacing
look
.
`
Where
's
*NL*
the
boy
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
thieves
eyed
their
preceptor
as
if
they
were
alarmed
at
his
*NL*
violence
;
and
looked
uneasily
at
each
other
.
But
they
made
no
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
's
become
of
the
boy
?
'
said
the
Jew
,
seizing
the
Dodger
tightly
by
*NL*
the
collar
,
and
threatening
him
with
horrid
imprecations
.
`
Speak
out
,
*NL*
or
I
'll
throttle
you
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Fagin
looked
so
very
much
in
earnest
,
that
Charley
Bates
,
who
*NL*
deemed
it
prudent
in
all
cases
to
be
on
the
safe
side
,
and
who
*NL*
conceived
it
by
no
means
improbable
that
it
might
be
his
turn
to
be
*NL*
throttled
second
,
dropped
upon
his
knees
,
and
raised
a
loud
,
*NL*
well-sustained
,
and
continuous
roar
--
something
between
a
mad
bull
and
a
*NL*
speaking
trumpet
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Will
you
speak
?
'
thundered
the
Jew
:
shaking
the
Dodger
so
much
that
*NL*
his
keeping
in
the
big
coat
at
all
,
seemed
perfectly
miraculous
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
the
traps
have
got
him
,
and
that
's
all
about
it
,
'
said
the
*NL*
Dodger
,
sullenly
.
`
Come
,
let
go
o
'
me
,
will
you
!
'
And
,
swinging
*NL*
himself
,
at
one
jerk
,
clean
out
of
the
big
coat
,
which
he
left
in
the
*NL*
Jew
's
hands
,
the
Dodger
snatched
up
the
toasting
fork
,
and
made
a
pass
*NL*
at
the
merry
old
gentleman
's
waistcoat
;
which
,
if
it
had
taken
effect
,
*NL*
would
have
let
a
little
more
merriment
out
than
could
have
been
easily
*NL*
replaced
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Jew
stepped
back
in
this
emergency
,
with
more
agility
than
could
*NL*
have
been
anticipated
in
a
man
of
his
apparent
decrepitude
;
and
,
*NL*
seizing
up
the
pot
,
prepared
to
hurl
it
at
his
assailant
's
head
.
But
*NL*
Charley
Bates
,
at
this
moment
,
calling
his
attention
by
a
perfectly
*NL*
terrific
howl
,
he
suddenly
altered
its
destination
,
and
flung
it
full
*NL*
at
that
young
gentleman
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
what
the
blazes
is
in
the
wind
now
!
'
growled
a
deep
voice
.
`
Who
*NL*
pitched
that
`
ere
at
me
?
It
's
well
it
's
the
beer
,
and
not
the
pot
,
as
*NL*
hit
me
,
or
I
'd
have
settled
somebody
.
I
might
have
know
'd
,
as
nobody
*NL*
but
an
infernal
,
rich
,
plundering
,
thundering
old
Jew
could
afford
to
*NL*
throw
away
any
drink
but
water
--
and
not
that
,
unless
he
done
the
River
*NL*
Company
every
quarter
.
Wot
's
it
all
about
,
Fagin
?
D
--
me
,
if
my
*NL*
neck-handkercher
a
n't
lined
with
beer
!
Come
in
,
you
sneaking
warmint
;
*NL*
wot
are
you
stopping
outside
for
,
as
if
you
was
ashamed
of
your
master
!
*NL*
Come
in
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
who
growled
out
these
words
,
was
a
stoutly-built
fellow
of
*NL*
about
five-and-thirty
,
in
a
black
velveteen
coat
,
very
soiled
drab
*NL*
breeches
,
lace-up
half
boots
,
and
grey
cotton
stockings
which
inclosed
*NL*
a
bulky
pair
of
legs
,
with
large
swelling
calves
;
--
the
kind
of
legs
,
*NL*
which
in
such
costume
,
always
look
in
an
unfinished
and
incomplete
*NL*
state
without
a
set
of
fetters
to
garnish
them
.
He
had
a
brown
hat
on
*NL*
his
head
,
and
a
dirty
belcher
handkerchief
round
his
neck
:
with
the
*NL*
long
frayed
ends
of
which
he
smeared
the
beer
from
his
face
as
he
*NL*
spoke
.
He
disclosed
,
when
he
had
done
so
,
a
broad
heavy
countenance
*NL*
with
a
beard
of
three
days
'
growth
,
and
two
scowling
eyes
;
one
of
which
*NL*
displayed
various
parti-coloured
symptoms
of
having
been
recently
*NL*
damaged
by
a
blow
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Come
in
,
d'ye
hear
?
'
growled
this
engaging
ruffian
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
white
shaggy
dog
,
with
his
face
scratched
and
torn
in
twenty
*NL*
different
places
,
skulked
into
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
did
n't
you
come
in
afore
?
'
said
the
man
.
`
You
're
getting
too
*NL*
proud
to
own
me
afore
company
,
are
you
?
Lie
down
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
This
command
was
accompanied
with
a
kick
,
which
sent
the
animal
to
the
*NL*
other
end
of
the
room
.
He
appeared
well
used
to
it
,
however
;
for
he
*NL*
coiled
himself
up
in
a
corner
very
quietly
,
without
uttering
a
sound
,
*NL*
and
winking
his
very
ill-looking
eyes
twenty
times
in
a
minute
,
*NL*
appeared
to
occupy
himself
in
taking
a
survey
of
the
apartment
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
are
you
up
to
?
Ill-treating
the
boys
,
you
covetous
,
avaricious
,
*NL*
in-sa-ti-a-ble
old
fence
?
'
said
the
man
,
seating
himself
deliberately
.
*NL*
'
I
wonder
they
do
n't
murder
you
!
I
would
if
I
was
them
.
If
I
'd
been
*NL*
your
`
prentice
,
I
'd
have
done
it
long
ago
,
and
--
no
,
I
could
n't
have
*NL*
sold
you
afterwards
,
for
you
're
fit
for
nothing
but
keeping
as
a
*NL*
curiousity
of
ugliness
in
a
glass
bottle
,
and
I
suppose
they
do
n't
blow
*NL*
glass
bottles
large
enough
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Hush
!
hush
!
Mr.
Sikes
,
'
said
the
Jew
,
trembling
;
`
do
n't
speak
so
loud
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
None
of
your
mistering
,
'
replied
the
ruffian
;
`
you
always
mean
*NL*
mischief
when
you
come
that
.
You
know
my
name
:
out
with
it
!
I
sha
n't
*NL*
disgrace
it
when
the
time
comes
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
well
,
then
--
Bill
Sikes
,
'
said
the
Jew
,
with
abject
humility
.
*NL*
`
You
seem
out
of
humour
,
Bill
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Perhaps
I
am
,
'
replied
Sikes
;
'
I
should
think
you
was
rather
out
of
*NL*
sorts
too
,
unless
you
mean
as
little
harm
when
you
throw
pewter
pots
*NL*
about
,
as
you
do
when
you
blab
and
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Are
you
mad
?
'
said
the
Jew
,
catching
the
man
by
the
sleeve
,
and
*NL*
pointing
towards
the
boys
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Sikes
contented
himself
with
tying
an
imaginary
knot
under
his
left
*NL*
ear
,
and
jerking
his
head
over
on
the
right
shoulder
;
a
piece
of
dumb
*NL*
show
which
the
Jew
appeared
to
understand
perfectly
.
He
then
,
in
cant
*NL*
terms
,
with
which
his
whole
conversation
was
plentifully
besprinkled
,
*NL*
but
which
would
be
quite
unintelligible
if
they
were
recorded
here
,
*NL*
demanded
a
glass
of
liquor
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
mind
you
do
n't
poison
it
,
'
said
Mr.
Sikes
,
laying
his
hat
upon
the
*NL*
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
said
in
jest
;
but
if
the
speaker
could
have
seen
the
evil
leer
*NL*
with
which
the
Jew
bit
his
pale
lip
as
he
turned
round
to
the
cupboard
,
*NL*
he
might
have
thought
the
caution
not
wholly
unnecessary
,
or
the
wish
*NL*
-LRB-
at
all
events
-RRB-
to
improve
upon
the
distiller
's
ingenuity
not
very
far
*NL*
from
the
old
gentleman
's
merry
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
swallowing
two
of
three
glasses
of
spirits
,
Mr.
Sikes
*NL*
condescended
to
take
some
notice
of
the
young
gentlemen
;
which
gracious
*NL*
act
led
to
a
conversation
,
in
which
the
cause
and
manner
of
Oliver
's
*NL*
capture
were
circumstantially
detailed
,
with
such
alterations
and
*NL*
improvements
on
the
truth
,
as
to
the
Dodger
appeared
most
advisable
*NL*
under
the
circumstances
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
'm
afraid
,
'
said
the
Jew
,
`
that
he
may
say
something
which
will
get
*NL*
us
into
trouble
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
's
very
likely
,
'
returned
Sikes
with
a
malicious
grin
.
`
You
're
*NL*
blowed
upon
,
Fagin
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
I
'm
afraid
,
you
see
,
'
added
the
Jew
,
speaking
as
if
he
had
not
*NL*
noticed
the
interruption
;
and
regarding
the
other
closely
as
he
did
*NL*
so
,
--
`
I
'm
afraid
that
,
if
the
game
was
up
with
us
,
it
might
be
up
with
*NL*
a
good
many
more
,
and
that
it
would
come
out
rather
worse
for
you
than
*NL*
it
would
for
me
,
my
dear
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
started
,
and
turned
round
upon
the
Jew
.
But
the
old
*NL*
gentleman
's
shoulders
were
shrugged
up
to
his
ears
;
and
his
eyes
were
*NL*
vacantly
staring
on
the
opposite
wall
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
long
pause
.
Every
member
of
the
respectable
coterie
*NL*
appeared
plunged
in
his
own
reflections
;
not
excepting
the
dog
,
who
by
*NL*
a
certain
malicious
licking
of
his
lips
seemed
to
be
meditating
an
*NL*
attack
upon
the
legs
of
the
first
gentleman
or
lady
he
might
encounter
*NL*
in
the
streets
when
he
went
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Somebody
must
find
out
wot
's
been
done
at
the
office
,
'
said
Mr.
Sikes
*NL*
in
a
much
lower
tone
than
he
had
taken
since
he
came
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Jew
nodded
assent
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
If
he
has
n't
peached
,
and
is
committed
,
there
's
no
fear
till
he
comes
*NL*
out
again
,
'
said
Mr.
Sikes
,
`
and
then
he
must
be
taken
care
on
.
You
*NL*
must
get
hold
of
him
somehow
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Again
the
Jew
nodded
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prudence
of
this
line
of
action
,
indeed
,
was
obvious
;
but
,
*NL*
unfortunately
,
there
was
one
very
strong
objection
to
its
being
*NL*
adopted
.
This
was
,
that
the
Dodger
,
and
Charley
Bates
,
and
Fagin
,
and
*NL*
Mr.
William
Sikes
,
happened
,
one
and
all
,
to
entertain
a
violent
and
*NL*
deeply-rooted
antipathy
to
going
near
a
police-office
on
any
ground
or
*NL*
pretext
whatever
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
long
they
might
have
sat
and
looked
at
each
other
,
in
a
state
of
*NL*
uncertainty
not
the
most
pleasant
of
its
kind
,
it
is
difficult
to
*NL*
guess
.
It
is
not
necessary
to
make
any
guesses
on
the
subject
,
*NL*
however
;
for
the
sudden
entrance
of
the
two
young
ladies
whom
Oliver
*NL*
had
seen
on
a
former
occasion
,
caused
the
conversation
to
flow
afresh
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
very
thing
!
'
said
the
Jew
.
`
Bet
will
go
;
wo
n't
you
,
my
dear
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Wheres
?
'
inquired
the
young
lady
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Only
just
up
to
the
office
,
my
dear
,
'
said
the
Jew
coaxingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
due
to
the
young
lady
to
say
that
she
did
not
positively
affirm
*NL*
that
she
would
not
,
but
that
she
merely
expressed
an
emphatic
and
*NL*
earnest
desire
to
be
`
blessed
'
if
she
would
;
a
polite
and
delicate
*NL*
evasion
of
the
request
,
which
shows
the
young
lady
to
have
been
*NL*
possessed
of
that
natural
good
breeding
which
can
not
bear
to
inflict
*NL*
upon
a
fellow-creature
,
the
pain
of
a
direct
and
pointed
refusal
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Jew
's
countenance
fell
.
He
turned
from
this
young
lady
,
who
was
*NL*
gaily
,
not
to
say
gorgeously
attired
,
in
a
red
gown
,
green
boots
,
and
*NL*
yellow
curl-papers
,
to
the
other
female
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Nancy
,
my
dear
,
'
said
the
Jew
in
a
soothing
manner
,
`
what
do
YOU
say
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
it
wo
n't
do
;
so
it
's
no
use
a-trying
it
on
,
Fagin
,
'
replied
Nancy
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
do
you
mean
by
that
?
'
said
Mr.
Sikes
,
looking
up
in
a
surly
*NL*
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
I
say
,
Bill
,
'
replied
the
lady
collectedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
you
're
just
the
very
person
for
it
,
'
reasoned
Mr.
Sikes
:
`
nobody
*NL*
about
here
knows
anything
of
you
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
as
I
do
n't
want
'em
to
,
neither
,
'
replied
Nancy
in
the
same
*NL*
composed
manner
,
`
it
's
rather
more
no
than
yes
with
me
,
Bill
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
She
'll
go
,
Fagin
,
'
said
Sikes
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
she
wo
n't
,
Fagin
,
'
said
Nancy
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
she
will
,
Fagin
,
'
said
Sikes
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
Mr.
Sikes
was
right
.
By
dint
of
alternate
threats
,
promises
,
and
*NL*
bribes
,
the
lady
in
question
was
ultimately
prevailed
upon
to
undertake
*NL*
the
commission
.
She
was
not
,
indeed
,
withheld
by
the
same
*NL*
considerations
as
her
agreeable
friend
;
for
,
having
recently
removed
*NL*
into
the
neighborhood
of
Field
Lane
from
the
remote
but
genteel
suburb
*NL*
of
Ratcliffe
,
she
was
not
under
the
same
apprehension
of
being
*NL*
recognised
by
any
of
her
numerous
acquaintances
.
*NL*
*NL*
Accordingly
,
with
a
clean
white
apron
tied
over
her
gown
,
and
her
*NL*
curl-papers
tucked
up
under
a
straw
bonnet
,
--
both
articles
of
dress
*NL*
being
provided
from
the
Jew
's
inexhaustible
stock
,
--
Miss
Nancy
prepared
*NL*
to
issue
forth
on
her
errand
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Stop
a
minute
,
my
dear
,
'
said
the
Jew
,
producing
,
a
little
covered
*NL*
basket
.
`
Carry
that
in
one
hand
.
It
looks
more
respectable
,
my
dear
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Give
her
a
door-key
to
carry
in
her
t
`
other
one
,
Fagin
,
'
said
Sikes
;
*NL*
`
it
looks
real
and
genivine
like
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
yes
,
my
dear
,
so
it
does
,
'
said
the
Jew
,
hanging
a
large
*NL*
street-door
key
on
the
forefinger
of
the
young
lady
's
right
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
There
;
very
good
!
Very
good
indeed
,
my
dear
!
'
said
the
Jew
,
rubbing
*NL*
his
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
,
my
brother
!
My
poor
,
dear
,
sweet
,
innocent
little
brother
!
'
*NL*
exclaimed
Nancy
,
bursting
into
tears
,
and
wringing
the
little
basket
*NL*
and
the
street-door
key
in
an
agony
of
distress
.
`
What
has
become
of
*NL*
him
!
Where
have
they
taken
him
to
!
Oh
,
do
have
pity
,
and
tell
me
*NL*
what
's
been
done
with
the
dear
boy
,
gentlemen
;
do
,
gentlemen
,
if
you
*NL*
please
,
gentlemen
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Having
uttered
those
words
in
a
most
lamentable
and
heart-broken
tone
:
*NL*
to
the
immeasurable
delight
of
her
hearers
:
Miss
Nancy
paused
,
winked
*NL*
to
the
company
,
nodded
smilingly
round
,
and
disappeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ah
,
she
's
a
clever
girl
,
my
dears
,
'
said
the
Jew
,
turning
round
to
his
*NL*
young
friends
,
and
shaking
his
head
gravely
,
as
if
in
mute
admonition
*NL*
to
them
to
follow
the
bright
example
they
had
just
beheld
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
She
's
a
honour
to
her
sex
,
'
said
Mr.
Sikes
,
filling
his
glass
,
and
*NL*
smiting
the
table
with
his
enormous
fist
.
`
Here
's
her
health
,
and
*NL*
wishing
they
was
all
like
her
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
While
these
,
and
many
other
encomiums
,
were
being
passed
on
the
*NL*
accomplished
Nancy
,
that
young
lady
made
the
best
of
her
way
to
the
*NL*
police-office
;
whither
,
notwithstanding
a
little
natural
timidity
*NL*
consequent
upon
walking
through
the
streets
alone
and
unprotected
,
she
*NL*
arrived
in
perfect
safety
shortly
afterwards
.
*NL*
*NL*
Entering
by
the
back
way
,
she
tapped
softly
with
the
key
at
one
of
the
*NL*
cell-doors
,
and
listened
.
There
was
no
sound
within
:
so
she
coughed
*NL*
and
listened
again
.
Still
there
was
no
reply
:
so
she
spoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Nolly
,
dear
?
'
murmured
Nancy
in
a
gentle
voice
;
`
Nolly
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
nobody
inside
but
a
miserable
shoeless
criminal
,
who
had
been
*NL*
taken
up
for
playing
the
flute
,
and
who
,
the
offence
against
society
*NL*
having
been
clearly
proved
,
had
been
very
properly
committed
by
Mr.
*NL*
Fang
to
the
House
of
Correction
for
one
month
;
with
the
appropriate
and
*NL*
amusing
remark
that
since
he
had
so
much
breath
to
spare
,
it
would
be
*NL*
more
wholesomely
expended
on
the
treadmill
than
in
a
musical
*NL*
instrument
.
He
made
no
answer
:
being
occupied
mentally
bewailing
the
*NL*
loss
of
the
flute
,
which
had
been
confiscated
for
the
use
of
the
*NL*
county
:
so
Nancy
passed
on
to
the
next
cell
,
and
knocked
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
!
'
cried
a
faint
and
feeble
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Is
there
a
little
boy
here
?
'
inquired
Nancy
,
with
a
preliminary
sob
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
'
replied
the
voice
;
`
God
forbid
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
a
vagrant
of
sixty-five
,
who
was
going
to
prison
for
_
not
_
*NL*
playing
the
flute
;
or
,
in
other
words
,
for
begging
in
the
streets
,
and
*NL*
doing
nothing
for
his
livelihood
.
In
the
next
cell
was
another
man
,
*NL*
who
was
going
to
the
same
prison
for
hawking
tin
saucepans
without
*NL*
license
;
thereby
doing
something
for
his
living
,
in
defiance
of
the
*NL*
Stamp-office
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
as
neither
of
these
criminals
answered
to
the
name
of
Oliver
,
or
*NL*
knew
anything
about
him
,
Nancy
made
straight
up
to
the
bluff
officer
in
*NL*
the
striped
waistcoat
;
and
with
the
most
piteous
wailings
and
*NL*
lamentations
,
rendered
more
piteous
by
a
prompt
and
efficient
use
of
*NL*
the
street-door
key
and
the
little
basket
,
demanded
her
own
dear
*NL*
brother
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
have
n't
got
him
,
my
dear
,
'
said
the
old
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Where
is
he
?
'
screamed
Nancy
,
in
a
distracted
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
the
gentleman
's
got
him
,
'
replied
the
officer
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
gentleman
!
Oh
,
gracious
heavens
!
What
gentleman
?
'
exclaimed
*NL*
Nancy
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
reply
to
this
incoherent
questioning
,
the
old
man
informed
the
*NL*
deeply
affected
sister
that
Oliver
had
been
taken
ill
in
the
office
,
*NL*
and
discharged
in
consequence
of
a
witness
having
proved
the
robbery
to
*NL*
have
been
committed
by
another
boy
,
not
in
custody
;
and
that
the
*NL*
prosecutor
had
carried
him
away
,
in
an
insensible
condition
,
to
his
own
*NL*
residence
:
of
and
concerning
which
,
all
the
informant
knew
was
,
that
*NL*
it
was
somewhere
in
Pentonville
,
he
having
heard
that
word
mentioned
in
*NL*
the
directions
to
the
coachman
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
dreadful
state
of
doubt
and
uncertainty
,
the
agonised
young
woman
*NL*
staggered
to
the
gate
,
and
then
,
exchanging
her
faltering
walk
for
a
*NL*
swift
run
,
returned
by
the
most
devious
and
complicated
route
she
could
*NL*
think
of
,
to
the
domicile
of
the
Jew
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bill
Sikes
no
sooner
heard
the
account
of
the
expedition
delivered
,
*NL*
than
he
very
hastily
called
up
the
white
dog
,
and
,
putting
on
his
hat
,
*NL*
expeditiously
departed
:
without
devoting
any
time
to
the
formality
of
*NL*
wishing
the
company
good-morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
We
must
know
where
he
is
,
my
dears
;
he
must
be
found
,
'
said
the
Jew
*NL*
greatly
excited
.
`
Charley
,
do
nothing
but
skulk
about
,
till
you
bring
*NL*
home
some
news
of
him
!
Nancy
,
my
dear
,
I
must
have
him
found
.
I
trust
*NL*
to
you
,
my
dear
,
--
to
you
and
the
Artful
for
everything
!
Stay
,
stay
,
'
*NL*
added
the
Jew
,
unlocking
a
drawer
with
a
shaking
hand
;
`
there
's
money
,
*NL*
my
dears
.
I
shall
shut
up
this
shop
to-night
.
You
'll
know
where
to
*NL*
find
me
!
Do
n't
stop
here
a
minute
.
Not
an
instant
,
my
dears
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
With
these
words
,
he
pushed
them
from
the
room
:
and
carefully
*NL*
double-locking
and
barring
the
door
behind
them
,
drew
from
its
place
of
*NL*
concealment
the
box
which
he
had
unintentionally
disclosed
to
Oliver
.
*NL*
Then
,
he
hastily
proceeded
to
dispose
the
watches
and
jewellery
beneath
*NL*
his
clothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
rap
at
the
door
startled
him
in
this
occupation
.
`
Who
's
there
?
'
he
*NL*
cried
in
a
shrill
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Me
!
'
replied
the
voice
of
the
Dodger
,
through
the
key-hole
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
now
?
'
cried
the
Jew
impatiently
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Is
he
to
be
kidnapped
to
the
other
ken
,
Nancy
says
?
'
inquired
the
*NL*
Dodger
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
'
replied
the
Jew
,
`
wherever
she
lays
hands
on
him
.
Find
him
,
*NL*
find
him
out
,
that
's
all
.
I
shall
know
what
to
do
next
;
never
fear
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
boy
murmured
a
reply
of
intelligence
:
and
hurried
downstairs
after
*NL*
his
companions
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
has
not
peached
so
far
,
'
said
the
Jew
as
he
pursued
his
occupation
.
*NL*
`
If
he
means
to
blab
us
among
his
new
friends
,
we
may
stop
his
mouth
*NL*
yet
.

CHAPTER
XIV
*NL*
*NL*
COMPRISING
FURTHER
PARTICULARS
OF
OLIVER
'S
STAY
AT
MR.
BROWNLOW
'S
,
WITH
*NL*
THE
REMARKABLE
PREDICTION
WHICH
ONE
MR.
GRIMWIG
UTTERED
CONCERNING
HIM
,
*NL*
WHEN
HE
WENT
OUT
ON
AN
ERRAND
*NL*
*NL*
Oliver
soon
recovering
from
the
fainting-fit
into
which
Mr.
Brownlow
's
*NL*
abrupt
exclamation
had
thrown
him
,
the
subject
of
the
picture
was
*NL*
carefully
avoided
,
both
by
the
old
gentleman
and
Mrs.
Bedwin
,
in
the
*NL*
conversation
that
ensued
:
which
indeed
bore
no
reference
to
Oliver
's
*NL*
history
or
prospects
,
but
was
confined
to
such
topics
as
might
amuse
*NL*
without
exciting
him
.
He
was
still
too
weak
to
get
up
to
breakfast
;
*NL*
but
,
when
he
came
down
into
the
housekeeper
's
room
next
day
,
his
first
*NL*
act
was
to
cast
an
eager
glance
at
the
wall
,
in
the
hope
of
again
*NL*
looking
on
the
face
of
the
beautiful
lady
.
His
expectations
were
*NL*
disappointed
,
however
,
for
the
picture
had
been
removed
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ah
!
'
said
the
housekeeper
,
watching
the
direction
of
Oliver
's
eyes
.
*NL*
`
It
is
gone
,
you
see
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
see
it
is
ma'am
,
'
replied
Oliver
.
`
Why
have
they
taken
it
away
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
has
been
taken
down
,
child
,
because
Mr.
Brownlow
said
,
that
as
it
*NL*
seemed
to
worry
you
,
perhaps
it
might
prevent
your
getting
well
,
you
*NL*
know
,
'
rejoined
the
old
lady
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
,
no
,
indeed
.
It
did
n't
worry
me
,
ma'am
,
'
said
Oliver
.
'
I
liked
to
*NL*
see
it
.
I
quite
loved
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
well
!
'
said
the
old
lady
,
good-humouredly
;
`
you
get
well
as
fast
*NL*
as
ever
you
can
,
dear
,
and
it
shall
be
hung
up
again
.
There
!
I
promise
*NL*
you
that
!
Now
,
let
us
talk
about
something
else
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
all
the
information
Oliver
could
obtain
about
the
picture
at
*NL*
that
time
.
As
the
old
lady
had
been
so
kind
to
him
in
his
illness
,
he
*NL*
endeavoured
to
think
no
more
of
the
subject
just
then
;
so
he
listened
*NL*
attentively
to
a
great
many
stories
she
told
him
,
about
an
amiable
and
*NL*
handsome
daughter
of
hers
,
who
was
married
to
an
amiable
and
handsome
*NL*
man
,
and
lived
in
the
country
;
and
about
a
son
,
who
was
clerk
to
a
*NL*
merchant
in
the
West
Indies
;
and
who
was
,
also
,
such
a
good
young
man
,
*NL*
and
wrote
such
dutiful
letters
home
four
times
a-year
,
that
it
brought
*NL*
the
tears
into
her
eyes
to
talk
about
them
.
When
the
old
lady
had
*NL*
expatiated
,
a
long
time
,
on
the
excellences
of
her
children
,
and
the
*NL*
merits
of
her
kind
good
husband
besides
,
who
had
been
dead
and
gone
,
*NL*
poor
dear
soul
!
just
six-and-twenty
years
,
it
was
time
to
have
tea
.
*NL*
After
tea
she
began
to
teach
Oliver
cribbage
:
which
he
learnt
as
*NL*
quickly
as
she
could
teach
:
and
at
which
game
they
played
,
with
great
*NL*
interest
and
gravity
,
until
it
was
time
for
the
invalid
to
have
some
*NL*
warm
wine
and
water
,
with
a
slice
of
dry
toast
,
and
then
to
go
cosily
*NL*
to
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
happy
days
,
those
of
Oliver
's
recovery
.
Everything
was
so
*NL*
quiet
,
and
neat
,
and
orderly
;
everybody
so
kind
and
gentle
;
that
after
*NL*
the
noise
and
turbulence
in
the
midst
of
which
he
had
always
lived
,
it
*NL*
seemed
like
Heaven
itself
.
He
was
no
sooner
strong
enough
to
put
his
*NL*
clothes
on
,
properly
,
than
Mr.
Brownlow
caused
a
complete
new
suit
,
and
*NL*
a
new
cap
,
and
a
new
pair
of
shoes
,
to
be
provided
for
him
.
As
Oliver
*NL*
was
told
that
he
might
do
what
he
liked
with
the
old
clothes
,
he
gave
*NL*
them
to
a
servant
who
had
been
very
kind
to
him
,
and
asked
her
to
sell
*NL*
them
to
a
Jew
,
and
keep
the
money
for
herself
.
This
she
very
readily
*NL*
did
;
and
,
as
Oliver
looked
out
of
the
parlour
window
,
and
saw
the
Jew
*NL*
roll
them
up
in
his
bag
and
walk
away
,
he
felt
quite
delighted
to
think
*NL*
that
they
were
safely
gone
,
and
that
there
was
now
no
possible
danger
*NL*
of
his
ever
being
able
to
wear
them
again
.
They
were
sad
rags
,
to
tell
*NL*
the
truth
;
and
Oliver
had
never
had
a
new
suit
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
evening
,
about
a
week
after
the
affair
of
the
picture
,
as
he
was
*NL*
sitting
talking
to
Mrs.
Bedwin
,
there
came
a
message
down
from
Mr.
*NL*
Brownlow
,
that
if
Oliver
Twist
felt
pretty
well
,
he
should
like
to
see
*NL*
him
in
his
study
,
and
talk
to
him
a
little
while
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Bless
us
,
and
save
us
!
Wash
your
hands
,
and
let
me
part
your
hair
*NL*
nicely
for
you
,
child
,
'
said
Mrs.
Bedwin
.
`
Dear
heart
alive
!
If
we
*NL*
had
known
he
would
have
asked
for
you
,
we
would
have
put
you
a
clean
*NL*
collar
on
,
and
made
you
as
smart
as
sixpence
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Oliver
did
as
the
old
lady
bade
him
;
and
,
although
she
lamented
*NL*
grievously
,
meanwhile
,
that
there
was
not
even
time
to
crimp
the
little
*NL*
frill
that
bordered
his
shirt-collar
;
he
looked
so
delicate
and
*NL*
handsome
,
despite
that
important
personal
advantage
,
that
she
went
so
*NL*
far
as
to
say
:
looking
at
him
with
great
complacency
from
head
to
*NL*
foot
,
that
she
really
did
n't
think
it
would
have
been
possible
,
on
the
*NL*
longest
notice
,
to
have
made
much
difference
in
him
for
the
better
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
encouraged
,
Oliver
tapped
at
the
study
door
.
On
Mr.
Brownlow
*NL*
calling
to
him
to
come
in
,
he
found
himself
in
a
little
back
room
,
*NL*
quite
full
of
books
,
with
a
window
,
looking
into
some
pleasant
little
*NL*
gardens
.
There
was
a
table
drawn
up
before
the
window
,
at
which
Mr.
*NL*
Brownlow
was
seated
reading
.
When
he
saw
Oliver
,
he
pushed
the
book
*NL*
away
from
him
,
and
told
him
to
come
near
the
table
,
and
sit
down
.
*NL*
Oliver
complied
;
marvelling
where
the
people
could
be
found
to
read
*NL*
such
a
great
number
of
books
as
seemed
to
be
written
to
make
the
world
*NL*
wiser
.
Which
is
still
a
marvel
to
more
experienced
people
than
Oliver
*NL*
Twist
,
every
day
of
their
lives
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
There
are
a
good
many
books
,
are
there
not
,
my
boy
?
'
said
Mr.
*NL*
Brownlow
,
observing
the
curiosity
with
which
Oliver
surveyed
the
*NL*
shelves
that
reached
from
the
floor
to
the
ceiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
A
great
number
,
sir
,
'
replied
Oliver
.
'
I
never
saw
so
many
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
shall
read
them
,
if
you
behave
well
,
'
said
the
old
gentleman
*NL*
kindly
;
`
and
you
will
like
that
,
better
than
looking
at
the
*NL*
outsides
,
--
that
is
,
some
cases
;
because
there
are
books
of
which
the
*NL*
backs
and
covers
are
by
far
the
best
parts
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
suppose
they
are
those
heavy
ones
,
sir
,
'
said
Oliver
,
pointing
to
*NL*
some
large
quartos
,
with
a
good
deal
of
gilding
about
the
binding
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Not
always
those
,
'
said
the
old
gentleman
,
patting
Oliver
on
the
head
,
*NL*
and
smiling
as
he
did
so
;
`
there
are
other
equally
heavy
ones
,
though
*NL*
of
a
much
smaller
size
.
How
should
you
like
to
grow
up
a
clever
man
,
*NL*
and
write
books
,
eh
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
think
I
would
rather
read
them
,
sir
,
'
replied
Oliver
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
!
would
n't
you
like
to
be
a
book-writer
?
'
said
the
old
gentleman
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oliver
considered
a
little
while
;
and
at
last
said
,
he
should
think
it
*NL*
would
be
a
much
better
thing
to
be
a
book-seller
;
upon
which
the
old
*NL*
gentleman
laughed
heartily
,
and
declared
he
had
said
a
very
good
thing
.
*NL*
Which
Oliver
felt
glad
to
have
done
,
though
he
by
no
means
knew
what
it
*NL*
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
well
,
'
said
the
old
gentleman
,
composing
his
features
.
`
Do
n't
be
*NL*
afraid
!
We
wo
n't
make
an
author
of
you
,
while
there
's
an
honest
trade
*NL*
to
be
learnt
,
or
brick-making
to
turn
to
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Thank
you
,
sir
,
'
said
Oliver
.
At
the
earnest
manner
of
his
reply
,
the
*NL*
old
gentleman
laughed
again
;
and
said
something
about
a
curious
*NL*
instinct
,
which
Oliver
,
not
understanding
,
paid
no
very
great
attention
*NL*
to
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Now
,
'
said
Mr.
Brownlow
,
speaking
if
possible
in
a
kinder
,
but
at
the
*NL*
same
time
in
a
much
more
serious
manner
,
than
Oliver
had
ever
known
him
*NL*
assume
yet
,
'
I
want
you
to
pay
great
attention
,
my
boy
,
to
what
I
am
*NL*
going
to
say
.
I
shall
talk
to
you
without
any
reserve
;
because
I
am
*NL*
sure
you
are
well
able
to
understand
me
,
as
many
older
persons
would
*NL*
be
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
,
do
n't
tell
you
are
going
to
send
me
away
,
sir
,
pray
!
'
exclaimed
*NL*
Oliver
,
alarmed
at
the
serious
tone
of
the
old
gentleman
's
*NL*
commencement
!
`
Do
n't
turn
me
out
of
doors
to
wander
in
the
streets
*NL*
again
.
Let
me
stay
here
,
and
be
a
servant
.
Do
n't
send
me
back
to
the
*NL*
wretched
place
I
came
from
.
Have
mercy
upon
a
poor
boy
,
sir
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
My
dear
child
,
'
said
the
old
gentleman
,
moved
by
the
warmth
of
*NL*
Oliver
's
sudden
appeal
;
`
you
need
not
be
afraid
of
my
deserting
you
,
*NL*
unless
you
give
me
cause
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
never
,
never
will
,
sir
,
'
interposed
Oliver
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
hope
not
,
'
rejoined
the
old
gentleman
.
'
I
do
not
think
you
ever
*NL*
will
.
I
have
been
deceived
,
before
,
in
the
objects
whom
I
have
*NL*
endeavoured
to
benefit
;
but
I
feel
strongly
disposed
to
trust
you
,
*NL*
nevertheless
;
and
I
am
more
interested
in
your
behalf
than
I
can
well
*NL*
account
for
,
even
to
myself
.
The
persons
on
whom
I
have
bestowed
my
*NL*
dearest
love
,
lie
deep
in
their
graves
;
but
,
although
the
happiness
and
*NL*
delight
of
my
life
lie
buried
there
too
,
I
have
not
made
a
coffin
of
my
*NL*
heart
,
and
sealed
it
up
,
forever
,
on
my
best
affections
.
Deep
*NL*
affliction
has
but
strengthened
and
refined
them
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
old
gentleman
said
this
in
a
low
voice
:
more
to
himself
than
to
*NL*
his
companion
:
and
as
he
remained
silent
for
a
short
time
afterwards
:
*NL*
Oliver
sat
quite
still
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
well
!
'
said
the
old
gentleman
at
length
,
in
a
more
cheerful
*NL*
tone
,
'
I
only
say
this
,
because
you
have
a
young
heart
;
and
knowing
*NL*
that
I
have
suffered
great
pain
and
sorrow
,
you
will
be
more
careful
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
not
to
wound
me
again
.
You
say
you
are
an
orphan
,
without
a
*NL*
friend
in
the
world
;
all
the
inquiries
I
have
been
able
to
make
,
*NL*
confirm
the
statement
.
Let
me
hear
your
story
;
where
you
come
from
;
*NL*
who
brought
you
up
;
and
how
you
got
into
the
company
in
which
I
found
*NL*
you
.
Speak
the
truth
,
and
you
shall
not
be
friendless
while
I
live
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Oliver
's
sobs
checked
his
utterance
for
some
minutes
;
when
he
was
on
*NL*
the
point
of
beginning
to
relate
how
he
had
been
brought
up
at
the
*NL*
farm
,
and
carried
to
the
workhouse
by
Mr.
Bumble
,
a
peculiarly
*NL*
impatient
little
double-knock
was
heard
at
the
street-door
:
and
the
*NL*
servant
,
running
upstairs
,
announced
Mr.
Grimwig
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Is
he
coming
up
?
'
inquired
Mr.
Brownlow
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
sir
,
'
replied
the
servant
.
`
He
asked
if
there
were
any
muffins
*NL*
in
the
house
;
and
,
when
I
told
him
yes
,
he
said
he
had
come
to
tea
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Brownlow
smiled
;
and
,
turning
to
Oliver
,
said
that
Mr.
Grimwig
was
*NL*
an
old
friend
of
his
,
and
he
must
not
mind
his
being
a
little
rough
in
*NL*
his
manners
;
for
he
was
a
worthy
creature
at
bottom
,
as
he
had
reason
*NL*
to
know
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Shall
I
go
downstairs
,
sir
?
'
inquired
Oliver
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
'
replied
Mr.
Brownlow
,
'
I
would
rather
you
remained
here
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
moment
,
there
walked
into
the
room
:
supporting
himself
by
a
*NL*
thick
stick
:
a
stout
old
gentleman
,
rather
lame
in
one
leg
,
who
was
*NL*
dressed
in
a
blue
coat
,
striped
waistcoat
,
nankeen
breeches
and
*NL*
gaiters
,
and
a
broad-brimmed
white
hat
,
with
the
sides
turned
up
with
*NL*
green
.
A
very
small-plaited
shirt
frill
stuck
out
from
his
waistcoat
;
*NL*
and
a
very
long
steel
watch-chain
,
with
nothing
but
a
key
at
the
end
,
*NL*
dangled
loosely
below
it
.
The
ends
of
his
white
neckerchief
were
*NL*
twisted
into
a
ball
about
the
size
of
an
orange
;
the
variety
of
shapes
*NL*
into
which
his
countenance
was
twisted
,
defy
description
.
He
had
a
*NL*
manner
of
screwing
his
head
on
one
side
when
he
spoke
;
and
of
looking
*NL*
out
of
the
corners
of
his
eyes
at
the
same
time
:
which
irresistibly
*NL*
reminded
the
beholder
of
a
parrot
.
In
this
attitude
,
he
fixed
himself
,
*NL*
the
moment
he
made
his
appearance
;
and
,
holding
out
a
small
piece
of
*NL*
orange-peel
at
arm
's
length
,
exclaimed
,
in
a
growling
,
discontented
*NL*
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Look
here
!
do
you
see
this
!
Is
n't
it
a
most
wonderful
and
*NL*
extraordinary
thing
that
I
ca
n't
call
at
a
man
's
house
but
I
find
a
*NL*
piece
of
this
poor
surgeon
's
friend
on
the
staircase
?
I
've
been
lamed
*NL*
with
orange-peel
once
,
and
I
know
orange-peel
will
be
my
death
,
or
I
'll
*NL*
be
content
to
eat
my
own
head
,
sir
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
handsome
offer
with
which
Mr.
Grimwig
backed
and
confirmed
*NL*
nearly
every
assertion
he
made
;
and
it
was
the
more
singular
in
his
*NL*
case
,
because
,
even
admitting
for
the
sake
of
argument
,
the
possibility
*NL*
of
scientific
improvements
being
brought
to
that
pass
which
will
enable
*NL*
a
gentleman
to
eat
his
own
head
in
the
event
of
his
being
so
disposed
,
*NL*
Mr.
Grimwig
's
head
was
such
a
particularly
large
one
,
that
the
most
*NL*
sanguine
man
alive
could
hardly
entertain
a
hope
of
being
able
to
get
*NL*
through
it
at
a
sitting
--
to
put
entirely
out
of
the
question
,
a
very
*NL*
thick
coating
of
powder
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
'll
eat
my
head
,
sir
,
'
repeated
Mr.
Grimwig
,
striking
his
stick
upon
*NL*
the
ground
.
`
Hallo
!
what
's
that
!
'
looking
at
Oliver
,
and
retreating
a
*NL*
pace
or
two
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
This
is
young
Oliver
Twist
,
whom
we
were
speaking
about
,
'
said
Mr.
*NL*
Brownlow
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oliver
bowed
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
do
n't
mean
to
say
that
's
the
boy
who
had
the
fever
,
I
hope
?
'
said
*NL*
Mr.
Grimwig
,
recoiling
a
little
more
.
`
Wait
a
minute
!
Do
n't
speak
!
*NL*
Stop
--
'
continued
Mr.
Grimwig
,
abruptly
,
losing
all
dread
of
the
fever
*NL*
in
his
triumph
at
the
discovery
;
`
that
's
the
boy
who
had
the
orange
!
*NL*
If
that
's
not
the
boy
,
sir
,
who
had
the
orange
,
and
threw
this
bit
of
*NL*
peel
upon
the
staircase
,
I
'll
eat
my
head
,
and
his
too
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
no
,
he
has
not
had
one
,
'
said
Mr.
Brownlow
,
laughing
.
`
Come
!
Put
*NL*
down
your
hat
;
and
speak
to
my
young
friend
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
feel
strongly
on
this
subject
,
sir
,
'
said
the
irritable
old
*NL*
gentleman
,
drawing
off
his
gloves
.
`
There
's
always
more
or
less
*NL*
orange-peel
on
the
pavement
in
our
street
;
and
I
_
know
_
it
's
put
there
*NL*
by
the
surgeon
's
boy
at
the
corner
.
A
young
woman
stumbled
over
a
bit
*NL*
last
night
,
and
fell
against
my
garden-railings
;
directly
she
got
up
I
*NL*
saw
her
look
towards
his
infernal
red
lamp
with
the
pantomime-light
.
*NL*
``
Do
n't
go
to
him
,
''
I
called
out
of
the
window
,
``
he
's
an
assassin
!
A
*NL*
man-trap
!
''
So
he
is
.
If
he
is
not
--
'
Here
the
irascible
old
*NL*
gentleman
gave
a
great
knock
on
the
ground
with
his
stick
;
which
was
*NL*
always
understood
,
by
his
friends
,
to
imply
the
customary
offer
,
*NL*
whenever
it
was
not
expressed
in
words
.
Then
,
still
keeping
his
stick
*NL*
in
his
hand
,
he
sat
down
;
and
,
opening
a
double
eye-glass
,
which
he
*NL*
wore
attached
to
a
broad
black
riband
,
took
a
view
of
Oliver
:
who
,
*NL*
seeing
that
he
was
the
object
of
inspection
,
coloured
,
and
bowed
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
's
the
boy
,
is
it
?
'
said
Mr.
Grimwig
,
at
length
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
's
the
boy
,
'
replied
Mr.
Brownlow
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
How
are
you
,
boy
?
'
said
Mr.
Grimwig
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
A
great
deal
better
,
thank
you
,
sir
,
'
replied
Oliver
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Brownlow
,
seeming
to
apprehend
that
his
singular
friend
was
about
*NL*
to
say
something
disagreeable
,
asked
Oliver
to
step
downstairs
and
tell
*NL*
Mrs.
Bedwin
they
were
ready
for
tea
;
which
,
as
he
did
not
half
like
the
*NL*
visitor
's
manner
,
he
was
very
happy
to
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
is
a
nice-looking
boy
,
is
he
not
?
'
inquired
Mr.
Brownlow
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
do
n't
know
,
'
replied
Mr.
Grimwig
,
pettishly
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Do
n't
know
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
.
I
do
n't
know
.
I
never
see
any
difference
in
boys
.
I
only
knew
*NL*
two
sort
of
boys
.
Mealy
boys
,
and
beef-faced
boys
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
which
is
Oliver
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Mealy
.
I
know
a
friend
who
has
a
beef-faced
boy
;
a
fine
boy
,
they
*NL*
call
him
;
with
a
round
head
,
and
red
cheeks
,
and
glaring
eyes
;
a
horrid
*NL*
boy
;
with
a
body
and
limbs
that
appear
to
be
swelling
out
of
the
seams
*NL*
of
his
blue
clothes
;
with
the
voice
of
a
pilot
,
and
the
appetite
of
a
*NL*
wolf
.
I
know
him
!
The
wretch
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Come
,
'
said
Mr.
Brownlow
,
`
these
are
not
the
characteristics
of
young
*NL*
Oliver
Twist
;
so
he
need
n't
excite
your
wrath
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
They
are
not
,
'
replied
Mr.
Grimwig
.
`
He
may
have
worse
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Here
,
Mr.
Brownlow
coughed
impatiently
;
which
appeared
to
afford
Mr.
*NL*
Grimwig
the
most
exquisite
delight
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
may
have
worse
,
I
say
,
'
repeated
Mr.
Grimwig
.
`
Where
does
he
come
*NL*
from
!
Who
is
he
?
What
is
he
?
He
has
had
a
fever
.
What
of
that
?
*NL*
Fevers
are
not
peculiar
to
good
people
;
are
they
?
Bad
people
have
*NL*
fevers
sometimes
;
have
n't
they
,
eh
?
I
knew
a
man
who
was
hung
in
*NL*
Jamaica
for
murdering
his
master
.
He
had
had
a
fever
six
times
;
he
*NL*
was
n't
recommended
to
mercy
on
that
account
.
Pooh
!
nonsense
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
the
fact
was
,
that
in
the
inmost
recesses
of
his
own
heart
,
Mr.
*NL*
Grimwig
was
strongly
disposed
to
admit
that
Oliver
's
appearance
and
*NL*
manner
were
unusually
prepossessing
;
but
he
had
a
strong
appetite
for
*NL*
contradiction
,
sharpened
on
this
occasion
by
the
finding
of
the
*NL*
orange-peel
;
and
,
inwardly
determining
that
no
man
should
dictate
to
*NL*
him
whether
a
boy
was
well-looking
or
not
,
he
had
resolved
,
from
the
*NL*
first
,
to
oppose
his
friend
.
When
Mr.
Brownlow
admitted
that
on
no
one
*NL*
point
of
inquiry
could
he
yet
return
a
satisfactory
answer
;
and
that
he
*NL*
had
postponed
any
investigation
into
Oliver
's
previous
history
until
he
*NL*
thought
the
boy
was
strong
enough
to
hear
it
;
Mr.
Grimwig
chuckled
*NL*
maliciously
.
And
he
demanded
,
with
a
sneer
,
whether
the
housekeeper
*NL*
was
in
the
habit
of
counting
the
plate
at
night
;
because
if
she
did
n't
*NL*
find
a
table-spoon
or
two
missing
some
sunshiny
morning
,
why
,
he
would
*NL*
be
content
to
--
and
so
forth
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
,
Mr.
Brownlow
,
although
himself
somewhat
of
an
impetuous
*NL*
gentleman
:
knowing
his
friend
's
peculiarities
,
bore
with
great
good
*NL*
humour
;
as
Mr.
Grimwig
,
at
tea
,
was
graciously
pleased
to
express
his
*NL*
entire
approval
of
the
muffins
,
matters
went
on
very
smoothly
;
and
*NL*
Oliver
,
who
made
one
of
the
party
,
began
to
feel
more
at
his
ease
than
*NL*
he
had
yet
done
in
the
fierce
old
gentleman
's
presence
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
when
are
you
going
to
hear
a
full
,
true
,
and
particular
account
of
*NL*
the
life
and
adventures
of
Oliver
Twist
?
'
asked
Grimwig
of
Mr.
*NL*
Brownlow
,
at
the
conclusion
of
the
meal
;
looking
sideways
at
Oliver
,
as
*NL*
he
resumed
his
subject
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
To-morrow
morning
,
'
replied
Mr.
Brownlow
.
'
I
would
rather
he
was
*NL*
alone
with
me
at
the
time
.
Come
up
to
me
to-morrow
morning
at
ten
*NL*
o'clock
,
my
dear
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
sir
,
'
replied
Oliver
.
He
answered
with
some
hesitation
,
because
*NL*
he
was
confused
by
Mr.
Grimwig
's
looking
so
hard
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
'll
tell
you
what
,
'
whispered
that
gentleman
to
Mr.
Brownlow
;
`
he
*NL*
wo
n't
come
up
to
you
to-morrow
morning
.
I
saw
him
hesitate
.
He
is
*NL*
deceiving
you
,
my
good
friend
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
'll
swear
he
is
not
,
'
replied
Mr.
Brownlow
,
warmly
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
If
he
is
not
,
'
said
Mr.
Grimwig
,
`
I
'll
--
'
and
down
went
the
stick
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
'll
answer
for
that
boy
's
truth
with
my
life
!
'
said
Mr.
Brownlow
,
*NL*
knocking
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
I
for
his
falsehood
with
my
head
!
'
rejoined
Mr.
Grimwig
,
knocking
*NL*
the
table
also
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
We
shall
see
,
'
said
Mr.
Brownlow
,
checking
his
rising
anger
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
We
will
,
'
replied
Mr.
Grimwig
,
with
a
provoking
smile
;
`
we
will
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
As
fate
would
have
it
,
Mrs.
Bedwin
chanced
to
bring
in
,
at
this
moment
,
*NL*
a
small
parcel
of
books
,
which
Mr.
Brownlow
had
that
morning
purchased
*NL*
of
the
identical
bookstall-keeper
,
who
has
already
figured
in
this
*NL*
history
;
having
laid
them
on
the
table
,
she
prepared
to
leave
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Stop
the
boy
,
Mrs.
Bedwin
!
'
said
Mr.
Brownlow
;
`
there
is
something
to
*NL*
go
back
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
has
gone
,
sir
,
'
replied
Mrs.
Bedwin
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Call
after
him
,
'
said
Mr.
Brownlow
;
`
it
's
particular
.
He
is
a
poor
*NL*
man
,
and
they
are
not
paid
for
.
There
are
some
books
to
be
taken
back
,
*NL*
too
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
street-door
was
opened
.
Oliver
ran
one
way
;
and
the
girl
ran
*NL*
another
;
and
Mrs.
Bedwin
stood
on
the
step
and
screamed
for
the
boy
;
*NL*
but
there
was
no
boy
in
sight
.
Oliver
and
the
girl
returned
,
in
a
*NL*
breathless
state
,
to
report
that
there
were
no
tidings
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Dear
me
,
I
am
very
sorry
for
that
,
'
exclaimed
Mr.
Brownlow
;
'
I
*NL*
particularly
wished
those
books
to
be
returned
to-night
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Send
Oliver
with
them
,
'
said
Mr.
Grimwig
,
with
an
ironical
smile
;
`
he
*NL*
will
be
sure
to
deliver
them
safely
,
you
know
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
;
do
let
me
take
them
,
if
you
please
,
sir
,
'
said
Oliver
.
`
I
'll
run
*NL*
all
the
way
,
sir
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
gentleman
was
just
going
to
say
that
Oliver
should
not
go
out
*NL*
on
any
account
;
when
a
most
malicious
cough
from
Mr.
Grimwig
determined
*NL*
him
that
he
should
;
and
that
,
by
his
prompt
discharge
of
the
*NL*
commission
,
he
should
prove
to
him
the
injustice
of
his
suspicions
:
on
*NL*
this
head
at
least
:
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
_
shall
_
go
,
my
dear
,
'
said
the
old
gentleman
.
`
The
books
are
on
a
*NL*
chair
by
my
table
.
Fetch
them
down
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Oliver
,
delighted
to
be
of
use
,
brought
down
the
books
under
his
arm
in
*NL*
a
great
bustle
;
and
waited
,
cap
in
hand
,
to
hear
what
message
he
was
to
*NL*
take
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
are
to
say
,
'
said
Mr.
Brownlow
,
glancing
steadily
at
Grimwig
;
`
you
*NL*
are
to
say
that
you
have
brought
those
books
back
;
and
that
you
have
*NL*
come
to
pay
the
four
pound
ten
I
owe
him
.
This
is
a
five-pound
note
,
*NL*
so
you
will
have
to
bring
me
back
,
ten
shillings
change
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
wo
n't
be
ten
minutes
,
sir
,
'
said
Oliver
,
eagerly
.
Having
buttoned
*NL*
up
the
bank-note
in
his
jacket
pocket
,
and
placed
the
books
carefully
*NL*
under
his
arm
,
he
made
a
respectful
bow
,
and
left
the
room
.
Mrs.
*NL*
Bedwin
followed
him
to
the
street-door
,
giving
him
many
directions
*NL*
about
the
nearest
way
,
and
the
name
of
the
bookseller
,
and
the
name
of
*NL*
the
street
:
all
of
which
Oliver
said
he
clearly
understood
.
Having
*NL*
superadded
many
injunctions
to
be
sure
and
not
take
cold
,
the
old
lady
*NL*
at
length
permitted
him
to
depart
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Bless
his
sweet
face
!
'
said
the
old
lady
,
looking
after
him
.
'
I
ca
n't
*NL*
bear
,
somehow
,
to
let
him
go
out
of
my
sight
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
moment
,
Oliver
looked
gaily
round
,
and
nodded
before
he
turned
*NL*
the
corner
.
The
old
lady
smilingly
returned
his
salutation
,
and
,
*NL*
closing
the
door
,
went
back
to
her
own
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Let
me
see
;
he
'll
be
back
in
twenty
minutes
,
at
the
longest
,
'
said
Mr.
*NL*
Brownlow
,
pulling
out
his
watch
,
and
placing
it
on
the
table
.
`
It
will
*NL*
be
dark
by
that
time
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
!
you
really
expect
him
to
come
back
,
do
you
?
'
inquired
Mr.
Grimwig
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Do
n't
you
?
'
asked
Mr.
Brownlow
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
spirit
of
contradiction
was
strong
in
Mr.
Grimwig
's
breast
,
at
the
*NL*
moment
;
and
it
was
rendered
stronger
by
his
friend
's
confident
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
'
he
said
,
smiting
the
table
with
his
fist
,
'
I
do
not
.
The
boy
has
*NL*
a
new
suit
of
clothes
on
his
back
,
a
set
of
valuable
books
under
his
*NL*
arm
,
and
a
five-pound
note
in
his
pocket
.
He
'll
join
his
old
friends
*NL*
the
thieves
,
and
laugh
at
you
.
If
ever
that
boy
returns
to
this
house
,
*NL*
sir
,
I
'll
eat
my
head
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
With
these
words
he
drew
his
chair
closer
to
the
table
;
and
there
the
*NL*
two
friends
sat
,
in
silent
expectation
,
with
the
watch
between
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
worthy
of
remark
,
as
illustrating
the
importance
we
attach
to
our
*NL*
own
judgments
,
and
the
pride
with
which
we
put
forth
our
most
rash
and
*NL*
hasty
conclusions
,
that
,
although
Mr.
Grimwig
was
not
by
any
means
a
*NL*
bad-hearted
man
,
and
though
he
would
have
been
unfeignedly
sorry
to
see
*NL*
his
respected
friend
duped
and
deceived
,
he
really
did
most
earnestly
*NL*
and
strongly
hope
at
that
moment
,
that
Oliver
Twist
might
not
come
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
grew
so
dark
,
that
the
figures
on
the
dial-plate
were
scarcely
*NL*
discernible
;
but
there
the
two
old
gentlemen
continued
to
sit
,
in
*NL*
silence
,
with
the
watch
between
them
.

CHAPTER
XV
*NL*
*NL*
SHOWING
HOW
VERY
FOND
OF
OLIVER
TWIST
,
THE
MERRY
OLD
JEW
AND
MISS
NANCY
*NL*
WERE
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
obscure
parlour
of
a
low
public-house
,
in
the
filthiest
part
of
*NL*
Little
Saffron
Hill
;
a
dark
and
gloomy
den
,
where
a
flaring
gas-light
*NL*
burnt
all
day
in
the
winter-time
;
and
where
no
ray
of
sun
ever
shone
in
*NL*
the
summer
:
there
sat
,
brooding
over
a
little
pewter
measure
and
a
*NL*
small
glass
,
strongly
impregnated
with
the
smell
of
liquor
,
a
man
in
a
*NL*
velveteen
coat
,
drab
shorts
,
half-boots
and
stockings
,
whom
even
by
*NL*
that
dim
light
no
experienced
agent
of
the
police
would
have
hesitated
*NL*
to
recognise
as
Mr.
William
Sikes
.
At
his
feet
,
sat
a
white-coated
,
*NL*
red-eyed
dog
;
who
occupied
himself
,
alternately
,
in
winking
at
his
*NL*
master
with
both
eyes
at
the
same
time
;
and
in
licking
a
large
,
fresh
*NL*
cut
on
one
side
of
his
mouth
,
which
appeared
to
be
the
result
of
some
*NL*
recent
conflict
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Keep
quiet
,
you
warmint
!
Keep
quiet
!
'
said
Mr.
Sikes
,
suddenly
*NL*
breaking
silence
.
Whether
his
meditations
were
so
intense
as
to
be
*NL*
disturbed
by
the
dog
's
winking
,
or
whether
his
feelings
were
so
wrought
*NL*
upon
by
his
reflections
that
they
required
all
the
relief
derivable
*NL*
from
kicking
an
unoffending
animal
to
allay
them
,
is
matter
for
*NL*
argument
and
consideration
.
Whatever
was
the
cause
,
the
effect
was
a
*NL*
kick
and
a
curse
,
bestowed
upon
the
dog
simultaneously
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dogs
are
not
generally
apt
to
revenge
injuries
inflicted
upon
them
by
*NL*
their
masters
;
but
Mr.
Sikes
's
dog
,
having
faults
of
temper
in
common
*NL*
with
his
owner
,
and
labouring
,
perhaps
,
at
this
moment
,
under
a
*NL*
powerful
sense
of
injury
,
made
no
more
ado
but
at
once
fixed
his
teeth
*NL*
in
one
of
the
half-boots
.
Having
given
in
a
hearty
shake
,
he
retired
,
*NL*
growling
,
under
a
form
;
just
escaping
the
pewter
measure
which
Mr.
*NL*
Sikes
levelled
at
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
would
,
would
you
?
'
said
Sikes
,
seizing
the
poker
in
one
hand
,
and
*NL*
deliberately
opening
with
the
other
a
large
clasp-knife
,
which
he
drew
*NL*
from
his
pocket
.
`
Come
here
,
you
born
devil
!
Come
here
!
D'ye
hear
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
dog
no
doubt
heard
;
because
Mr.
Sikes
spoke
in
the
very
harshest
*NL*
key
of
a
very
harsh
voice
;
but
,
appearing
to
entertain
some
*NL*
unaccountable
objection
to
having
his
throat
cut
,
he
remained
where
he
*NL*
was
,
and
growled
more
fiercely
than
before
:
at
the
same
time
grasping
*NL*
the
end
of
the
poker
between
his
teeth
,
and
biting
at
it
like
a
wild
*NL*
beast
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
resistance
only
infuriated
Mr.
Sikes
the
more
;
who
,
dropping
on
*NL*
his
knees
,
began
to
assail
the
animal
most
furiously
.
The
dog
jumped
*NL*
from
right
to
left
,
and
from
left
to
right
;
snapping
,
growling
,
and
*NL*
barking
;
the
man
thrust
and
swore
,
and
struck
and
blasphemed
;
and
the
*NL*
struggle
was
reaching
a
most
critical
point
for
one
or
other
;
when
,
the
*NL*
door
suddenly
opening
,
the
dog
darted
out
:
leaving
Bill
Sikes
with
the
*NL*
poker
and
the
clasp-knife
in
his
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
must
always
be
two
parties
to
a
quarrel
,
says
the
old
adage
.
Mr.
*NL*
Sikes
,
being
disappointed
of
the
dog
's
participation
,
at
once
*NL*
transferred
his
share
in
the
quarrel
to
the
new
comer
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
the
devil
do
you
come
in
between
me
and
my
dog
for
?
'
said
Sikes
,
*NL*
with
a
fierce
gesture
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
did
n't
know
,
my
dear
,
I
did
n't
know
,
'
replied
Fagin
,
humbly
;
for
the
*NL*
Jew
was
the
new
comer
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Did
n't
know
,
you
white-livered
thief
!
'
growled
Sikes
.
`
Could
n't
you
*NL*
hear
the
noise
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Not
a
sound
of
it
,
as
I
'm
a
living
man
,
Bill
,
'
replied
the
Jew
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
no
!
You
hear
nothing
,
you
do
n't
,
'
retorted
Sikes
with
a
fierce
*NL*
sneer
.
`
Sneaking
in
and
out
,
so
as
nobody
hears
how
you
come
or
go
!
I
*NL*
wish
you
had
been
the
dog
,
Fagin
,
half
a
minute
ago
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
?
'
inquired
the
Jew
with
a
forced
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
'Cause
the
government
,
as
cares
for
the
lives
of
such
men
as
you
,
as
*NL*
have
n't
half
the
pluck
of
curs
,
lets
a
man
kill
a
dog
how
he
likes
,
'
*NL*
replied
Sikes
,
shutting
up
the
knife
with
a
very
expressive
look
;
*NL*
`
that
's
why
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
Jew
rubbed
his
hands
;
and
,
sitting
down
at
the
table
,
affected
to
*NL*
laugh
at
the
pleasantry
of
his
friend
.
He
was
obviously
very
ill
at
*NL*
ease
,
however
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Grin
away
,
'
said
Sikes
,
replacing
the
poker
,
and
surveying
him
with
*NL*
savage
contempt
;
`
grin
away
.
You
'll
never
have
the
laugh
at
me
,
*NL*
though
,
unless
it
's
behind
a
nightcap
.
I
've
got
the
upper
hand
over
*NL*
you
,
Fagin
;
and
,
d
--
me
,
I
'll
keep
it
.
There
!
If
I
go
,
you
go
;
so
take
*NL*
care
of
me
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
well
,
my
dear
,
'
said
the
Jew
,
'
I
know
all
that
;
we
--
we
--
have
a
*NL*
mutual
interest
,
Bill
,
--
a
mutual
interest
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Humph
,
'
said
Sikes
,
as
if
he
thought
the
interest
lay
rather
more
on
*NL*
the
Jew
's
side
than
on
his
.
`
Well
,
what
have
you
got
to
say
to
me
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
's
all
passed
safe
through
the
melting-pot
,
'
replied
Fagin
,
`
and
*NL*
this
is
your
share
.
It
's
rather
more
than
it
ought
to
be
,
my
dear
;
but
*NL*
as
I
know
you
'll
do
me
a
good
turn
another
time
,
and
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Stow
that
gammon
,
'
interposed
the
robber
,
impatiently
.
`
Where
is
it
?
*NL*
Hand
over
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
yes
,
Bill
;
give
me
time
,
give
me
time
,
'
replied
the
Jew
,
*NL*
soothingly
.
`
Here
it
is
!
All
safe
!
'
As
he
spoke
,
he
drew
forth
an
*NL*
old
cotton
handkerchief
from
his
breast
;
and
untying
a
large
knot
in
*NL*
one
corner
,
produced
a
small
brown-paper
packet
.
Sikes
,
snatching
it
*NL*
from
him
,
hastily
opened
it
;
and
proceeded
to
count
the
sovereigns
it
*NL*
contained
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
This
is
all
,
is
it
?
'
inquired
Sikes
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
All
,
'
replied
the
Jew
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
have
n't
opened
the
parcel
and
swallowed
one
or
two
as
you
come
*NL*
along
,
have
you
?
'
inquired
Sikes
,
suspiciously
.
`
Do
n't
put
on
an
*NL*
injured
look
at
the
question
;
you
've
done
it
many
a
time
.
Jerk
the
*NL*
tinkler
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
These
words
,
in
plain
English
,
conveyed
an
injunction
to
ring
the
bell
.
*NL*
It
was
answered
by
another
Jew
:
younger
than
Fagin
,
but
nearly
as
vile
*NL*
and
repulsive
in
appearance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bill
Sikes
merely
pointed
to
the
empty
measure
.
The
Jew
,
perfectly
*NL*
understanding
the
hint
,
retired
to
fill
it
:
previously
exchanging
a
*NL*
remarkable
look
with
Fagin
,
who
raised
his
eyes
for
an
instant
,
as
if
*NL*
in
expectation
of
it
,
and
shook
his
head
in
reply
;
so
slightly
that
the
*NL*
action
would
have
been
almost
imperceptible
to
an
observant
third
*NL*
person
.
It
was
lost
upon
Sikes
,
who
was
stooping
at
the
moment
to
tie
*NL*
the
boot-lace
which
the
dog
had
torn
.
Possibly
,
if
he
had
observed
the
*NL*
brief
interchange
of
signals
,
he
might
have
thought
that
it
boded
no
*NL*
good
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Is
anybody
here
,
Barney
?
'
inquired
Fagin
;
speaking
,
now
that
that
*NL*
Sikes
was
looking
on
,
without
raising
his
eyes
from
the
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Dot
a
shoul
,
'
replied
Barney
;
whose
words
:
whether
they
came
from
the
*NL*
heart
or
not
:
made
their
way
through
the
nose
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Nobody
?
'
inquired
Fagin
,
in
a
tone
of
surprise
:
which
perhaps
might
*NL*
mean
that
Barney
was
at
liberty
to
tell
the
truth
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Dobody
but
Biss
Dadsy
,
'
replied
Barney
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Nancy
!
'
exclaimed
Sikes
.
`
Where
?
Strike
me
blind
,
if
I
do
n't
honour
*NL*
that
`
ere
girl
,
for
her
native
talents
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
She
's
bid
havid
a
plate
of
boiled
beef
id
the
bar
,
'
replied
Barney
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Send
her
here
,
'
said
Sikes
,
pouring
out
a
glass
of
liquor
.
`
Send
her
*NL*
here
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Barney
looked
timidly
at
Fagin
,
as
if
for
permission
;
the
Jew
remaining
*NL*
silent
,
and
not
lifting
his
eyes
from
the
ground
,
he
retired
;
and
*NL*
presently
returned
,
ushering
in
Nancy
;
who
was
decorated
with
the
*NL*
bonnet
,
apron
,
basket
,
and
street-door
key
,
complete
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
are
on
the
scent
,
are
you
,
Nancy
?
'
inquired
Sikes
,
proffering
the
*NL*
glass
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
I
am
,
Bill
,
'
replied
the
young
lady
,
disposing
of
its
contents
;
*NL*
`
and
tired
enough
of
it
I
am
,
too
.
The
young
brat
's
been
ill
and
*NL*
confined
to
the
crib
;
and
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ah
,
Nancy
,
dear
!
'
said
Fagin
,
looking
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
whether
a
peculiar
contraction
of
the
Jew
's
red
eye-brows
,
and
a
*NL*
half
closing
of
his
deeply-set
eyes
,
warned
Miss
Nancy
that
she
was
*NL*
disposed
to
be
too
communicative
,
is
not
a
matter
of
much
importance
.
*NL*
The
fact
is
all
we
need
care
for
here
;
and
the
fact
is
,
that
she
*NL*
suddenly
checked
herself
,
and
with
several
gracious
smiles
upon
Mr.
*NL*
Sikes
,
turned
the
conversation
to
other
matters
.
In
about
ten
minutes
'
*NL*
time
,
Mr.
Fagin
was
seized
with
a
fit
of
coughing
;
upon
which
Nancy
*NL*
pulled
her
shawl
over
her
shoulders
,
and
declared
it
was
time
to
go
.
*NL*
Mr.
Sikes
,
finding
that
he
was
walking
a
short
part
of
her
way
himself
,
*NL*
expressed
his
intention
of
accompanying
her
;
they
went
away
together
,
*NL*
followed
,
at
a
little
distant
,
by
the
dog
,
who
slunk
out
of
a
back-yard
*NL*
as
soon
as
his
master
was
out
of
sight
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Jew
thrust
his
head
out
of
the
room
door
when
Sikes
had
left
it
;
*NL*
looked
after
him
as
we
walked
up
the
dark
passage
;
shook
his
clenched
*NL*
fist
;
muttered
a
deep
curse
;
and
then
,
with
a
horrible
grin
,
reseated
*NL*
himself
at
the
table
;
where
he
was
soon
deeply
absorbed
in
the
*NL*
interesting
pages
of
the
Hue-and-Cry
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
Oliver
Twist
,
little
dreaming
that
he
was
within
so
very
*NL*
short
a
distance
of
the
merry
old
gentleman
,
was
on
his
way
to
the
*NL*
book-stall
.
When
he
got
into
Clerkenwell
,
he
accidently
turned
down
a
*NL*
by-street
which
was
not
exactly
in
his
way
;
but
not
discovering
his
*NL*
mistake
until
he
had
got
half-way
down
it
,
and
knowing
it
must
lead
in
*NL*
the
right
direction
,
he
did
not
think
it
worth
while
to
turn
back
;
and
*NL*
so
marched
on
,
as
quickly
as
he
could
,
with
the
books
under
his
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
walking
along
,
thinking
how
happy
and
contented
he
ought
to
*NL*
feel
;
and
how
much
he
would
give
for
only
one
look
at
poor
little
Dick
,
*NL*
who
,
starved
and
beaten
,
might
be
weeping
bitterly
at
that
very
moment
;
*NL*
when
he
was
startled
by
a
young
woman
screaming
out
very
loud
.
`
Oh
,
my
*NL*
dear
brother
!
'
And
he
had
hardly
looked
up
,
to
see
what
the
matter
*NL*
was
,
when
he
was
stopped
by
having
a
pair
of
arms
thrown
tight
round
*NL*
his
neck
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Do
n't
,
'
cried
Oliver
,
struggling
.
`
Let
go
of
me
.
Who
is
it
?
What
are
*NL*
you
stopping
me
for
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
only
reply
to
this
,
was
a
great
number
of
loud
lamentations
from
*NL*
the
young
woman
who
had
embraced
him
;
and
who
had
a
little
basket
and
a
*NL*
street-door
key
in
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
my
gracious
!
'
said
the
young
woman
,
'
I
have
found
him
!
Oh
!
Oliver
!
*NL*
Oliver
!
Oh
you
naughty
boy
,
to
make
me
suffer
such
distress
on
your
*NL*
account
!
Come
home
,
dear
,
come
.
Oh
,
I
've
found
him
.
Thank
gracious
*NL*
goodness
heavins
,
I
've
found
him
!
'
With
these
incoherent
exclamations
,
*NL*
the
young
woman
burst
into
another
fit
of
crying
,
and
got
so
dreadfully
*NL*
hysterical
,
that
a
couple
of
women
who
came
up
at
the
moment
asked
a
*NL*
butcher
's
boy
with
a
shiny
head
of
hair
anointed
with
suet
,
who
was
*NL*
also
looking
on
,
whether
he
did
n't
think
he
had
better
run
for
the
*NL*
doctor
.
To
which
,
the
butcher
's
boy
:
who
appeared
of
a
lounging
,
not
*NL*
to
say
indolent
disposition
:
replied
,
that
he
thought
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
,
no
,
no
,
never
mind
,
'
said
the
young
woman
,
grasping
Oliver
's
hand
;
*NL*
`
I
'm
better
now
.
Come
home
directly
,
you
cruel
boy
!
Come
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
,
ma'am
,
'
replied
the
young
woman
,
`
he
ran
away
,
near
a
month
ago
,
*NL*
from
his
parents
,
who
are
hard-working
and
respectable
people
;
and
went
*NL*
and
joined
a
set
of
thieves
and
bad
characters
;
and
almost
broke
his
*NL*
mother
's
heart
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Young
wretch
!
'
said
one
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Go
home
,
do
,
you
little
brute
,
'
said
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
am
not
,
'
replied
Oliver
,
greatly
alarmed
.
'
I
do
n't
know
her
.
I
*NL*
have
n't
any
sister
,
or
father
and
mother
either
.
I
'm
an
orphan
;
I
live
*NL*
at
Pentonville
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Only
hear
him
,
how
he
braves
it
out
!
'
cried
the
young
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
it
's
Nancy
!
'
exclaimed
Oliver
;
who
now
saw
her
face
for
the
first
*NL*
time
;
and
started
back
,
in
irrepressible
astonishment
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
see
he
knows
me
!
'
cried
Nancy
,
appealing
to
the
bystanders
.
`
He
*NL*
ca
n't
help
himself
.
Make
him
come
home
,
there
's
good
people
,
or
he
'll
*NL*
kill
his
dear
mother
and
father
,
and
break
my
heart
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
the
devil
's
this
?
'
said
a
man
,
bursting
out
of
a
beer-shop
,
with
*NL*
a
white
dog
at
his
heels
;
`
young
Oliver
!
Come
home
to
your
poor
mother
,
*NL*
you
young
dog
!
Come
home
directly
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
do
n't
belong
to
them
.
I
do
n't
know
them
.
Help
!
help
!
'
cried
*NL*
Oliver
,
struggling
in
the
man
's
powerful
grasp
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Help
!
'
repeated
the
man
.
`
Yes
;
I
'll
help
you
,
you
young
rascal
!
*NL*
*NL*
What
books
are
these
?
You
've
been
a
stealing
'em
,
have
you
?
Give
'em
*NL*
here
.
'
With
these
words
,
the
man
tore
the
volumes
from
his
grasp
,
and
*NL*
struck
him
on
the
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
's
right
!
'
cried
a
looker-on
,
from
a
garret-window
.
`
That
's
the
*NL*
only
way
of
bringing
him
to
his
senses
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
To
be
sure
!
'
cried
a
sleepy-faced
carpenter
,
casting
an
approving
look
*NL*
at
the
garret-window
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
'll
do
him
good
!
'
said
the
two
women
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
he
shall
have
it
,
too
!
'
rejoined
the
man
,
administering
another
*NL*
blow
,
and
seizing
Oliver
by
the
collar
.
`
Come
on
,
you
young
villain
!
*NL*
Here
,
Bull
's
-
eye
,
mind
him
,
boy
!
Mind
him
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Weak
with
recent
illness
;
stupified
by
the
blows
and
the
suddenness
of
*NL*
the
attack
;
terrified
by
the
fierce
growling
of
the
dog
,
and
the
*NL*
brutality
of
the
man
;
overpowered
by
the
conviction
of
the
bystanders
*NL*
that
he
really
was
the
hardened
little
wretch
he
was
described
to
be
;
*NL*
what
could
one
poor
child
do
!
Darkness
had
set
in
;
it
was
a
low
*NL*
neighborhood
;
no
help
was
near
;
resistance
was
useless
.
In
another
*NL*
moment
he
was
dragged
into
a
labyrinth
of
dark
narrow
courts
,
and
was
*NL*
forced
along
them
at
a
pace
which
rendered
the
few
cries
he
dared
to
*NL*
give
utterance
to
,
unintelligible
.
It
was
of
little
moment
,
indeed
,
*NL*
whether
they
were
intelligible
or
no
;
for
there
was
nobody
to
care
for
*NL*
them
,
had
they
been
ever
so
plain
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
The
gas-lamps
were
lighted
;
Mrs.
Bedwin
was
waiting
anxiously
at
the
*NL*
open
door
;
the
servant
had
run
up
the
street
twenty
times
to
see
if
*NL*
there
were
any
traces
of
Oliver
;
and
still
the
two
old
gentlemen
sat
,
*NL*
perseveringly
,
in
the
dark
parlour
,
with
the
watch
between
them
.

CHAPTER
XVI
*NL*
*NL*
RELATES
WHAT
BECAME
OF
OLIVER
TWIST
,
AFTER
HE
HAD
BEEN
CLAIMED
BY
NANCY
*NL*
*NL*
The
narrow
streets
and
courts
,
at
length
,
terminated
in
a
large
open
*NL*
space
;
scattered
about
which
,
were
pens
for
beasts
,
and
other
*NL*
indications
of
a
cattle-market
.
Sikes
slackened
his
pace
when
they
*NL*
reached
this
spot
:
the
girl
being
quite
unable
to
support
any
longer
,
*NL*
the
rapid
rate
at
which
they
had
hitherto
walked
.
Turning
to
Oliver
,
*NL*
he
roughly
commanded
him
to
take
hold
of
Nancy
's
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Do
you
hear
?
'
growled
Sikes
,
as
Oliver
hesitated
,
and
looked
round
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
in
a
dark
corner
,
quite
out
of
the
track
of
passengers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oliver
saw
,
but
too
plainly
,
that
resistance
would
be
of
no
avail
.
He
*NL*
held
out
his
hand
,
which
Nancy
clasped
tight
in
hers
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Give
me
the
other
,
'
said
Sikes
,
seizing
Oliver
's
unoccupied
hand
.
*NL*
`
Here
,
Bull
's
-
Eye
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
dog
looked
up
,
and
growled
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
See
here
,
boy
!
'
said
Sikes
,
putting
his
other
hand
to
Oliver
's
throat
;
*NL*
`
if
he
speaks
ever
so
soft
a
word
,
hold
him
!
D'ye
mind
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
dog
growled
again
;
and
licking
his
lips
,
eyed
Oliver
as
if
he
were
*NL*
anxious
to
attach
himself
to
his
windpipe
without
delay
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
's
as
willing
as
a
Christian
,
strike
me
blind
if
he
is
n't
!
'
said
*NL*
Sikes
,
regarding
the
animal
with
a
kind
of
grim
and
ferocious
approval
.
*NL*
`
Now
,
you
know
what
you
've
got
to
expect
,
master
,
so
call
away
as
quick
*NL*
as
you
like
;
the
dog
will
soon
stop
that
game
.
Get
on
,
young
`
un
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Bull
's
-
eye
wagged
his
tail
in
acknowledgment
of
this
unusually
*NL*
endearing
form
of
speech
;
and
,
giving
vent
to
another
admonitory
growl
*NL*
for
the
benefit
of
Oliver
,
led
the
way
onward
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
Smithfield
that
they
were
crossing
,
although
it
might
have
been
*NL*
Grosvenor
Square
,
for
anything
Oliver
knew
to
the
contrary
.
The
night
*NL*
was
dark
and
foggy
.
The
lights
in
the
shops
could
scarecely
struggle
*NL*
through
the
heavy
mist
,
which
thickened
every
moment
and
shrouded
the
*NL*
streets
and
houses
in
gloom
;
rendering
the
strange
place
still
stranger
*NL*
in
Oliver
's
eyes
;
and
making
his
uncertainty
the
more
dismal
and
*NL*
depressing
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
hurried
on
a
few
paces
,
when
a
deep
church-bell
struck
the
*NL*
hour
.
With
its
first
stroke
,
his
two
conductors
stopped
,
and
turned
*NL*
their
heads
in
the
direction
whence
the
sound
proceeded
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Eight
o
'
clock
,
Bill
,
'
said
Nancy
,
when
the
bell
ceased
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
's
the
good
of
telling
me
that
;
I
can
hear
it
,
ca
n't
I
!
'
replied
*NL*
Sikes
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
wonder
whether
THEY
can
hear
it
,
'
said
Nancy
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Of
course
they
can
,
'
replied
Sikes
.
`
It
was
Bartlemy
time
when
I
was
*NL*
shopped
;
and
there
war
n't
a
penny
trumpet
in
the
fair
,
as
I
could
n't
*NL*
hear
the
squeaking
on
.
Arter
I
was
locked
up
for
the
night
,
the
row
*NL*
and
din
outside
made
the
thundering
old
jail
so
silent
,
that
I
could
*NL*
almost
have
beat
my
brains
out
against
the
iron
plates
of
the
door
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Poor
fellow
!
'
said
Nancy
,
who
still
had
her
face
turned
towards
the
*NL*
quarter
in
which
the
bell
had
sounded
.
`
Oh
,
Bill
,
such
fine
young
*NL*
chaps
as
them
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
;
that
's
all
you
women
think
of
,
'
answered
Sikes
.
`
Fine
young
*NL*
chaps
!
Well
,
they
're
as
good
as
dead
,
so
it
do
n't
much
matter
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
With
this
consolation
,
Mr.
Sikes
appeared
to
repress
a
rising
tendency
*NL*
to
jealousy
,
and
,
clasping
Oliver
's
wrist
more
firmly
,
told
him
to
step
*NL*
out
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Wait
a
minute
!
'
said
the
girl
:
'
I
would
n't
hurry
by
,
if
it
was
you
*NL*
that
was
coming
out
to
be
hung
,
the
next
time
eight
o'clock
struck
,
*NL*
Bill
.
I
'd
walk
round
and
round
the
place
till
I
dropped
,
if
the
snow
*NL*
was
on
the
ground
,
and
I
had
n't
a
shawl
to
cover
me
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
what
good
would
that
do
?
'
inquired
the
unsentimental
Mr.
Sikes
.
*NL*
`
Unless
you
could
pitch
over
a
file
and
twenty
yards
of
good
stout
*NL*
rope
,
you
might
as
well
be
walking
fifty
mile
off
,
or
not
walking
at
*NL*
all
,
for
all
the
good
it
would
do
me
.
Come
on
,
and
do
n't
stand
*NL*
preaching
there
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
girl
burst
into
a
laugh
;
drew
her
shawl
more
closely
round
her
;
and
*NL*
they
walked
away
.
But
Oliver
felt
her
hand
tremble
,
and
,
looking
up
in
*NL*
her
face
as
they
passed
a
gas-lamp
,
saw
that
it
had
turned
a
deadly
*NL*
white
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
walked
on
,
by
little-frequented
and
dirty
ways
,
for
a
full
*NL*
half-hour
:
meeting
very
few
people
,
and
those
appearing
from
their
*NL*
looks
to
hold
much
the
same
position
in
society
as
Mr.
Sikes
himself
.
*NL*
At
length
they
turned
into
a
very
filthy
narrow
street
,
nearly
full
of
*NL*
old-clothes
shops
;
the
dog
running
forward
,
as
if
conscious
that
there
*NL*
was
no
further
occasion
for
his
keeping
on
guard
,
stopped
before
the
*NL*
door
of
a
shop
that
was
closed
and
apparently
untenanted
;
the
house
was
*NL*
in
a
ruinous
condition
,
and
on
the
door
was
nailed
a
board
,
intimating
*NL*
that
it
was
to
let
:
which
looked
as
if
it
had
hung
there
for
many
*NL*
years
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
All
right
,
'
cried
Sikes
,
glancing
cautiously
about
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nancy
stooped
below
the
shutters
,
and
Oliver
heard
the
sound
of
a
bell
.
*NL*
They
crossed
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
,
and
stood
for
a
few
*NL*
moments
under
a
lamp
.
A
noise
,
as
if
a
sash
window
were
gently
raised
,
*NL*
was
heard
;
and
soon
afterwards
the
door
softly
opened
.
Mr.
Sikes
then
*NL*
seized
the
terrified
boy
by
the
collar
with
very
little
ceremony
;
and
*NL*
all
three
were
quickly
inside
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
passage
was
perfectly
dark
.
They
waited
,
while
the
person
who
had
*NL*
let
them
in
,
chained
and
barred
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Anybody
here
?
'
inquired
Sikes
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
'
replied
a
voice
,
which
Oliver
thought
he
had
heard
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Is
the
old
`
un
here
?
'
asked
the
robber
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
'
replied
the
voice
,
`
and
precious
down
in
the
mouth
he
has
been
.
*NL*
Wo
n't
he
be
glad
to
see
you
?
Oh
,
no
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
style
of
this
reply
,
as
well
as
the
voice
which
delivered
it
,
*NL*
seemed
familiar
to
Oliver
's
ears
:
but
it
was
impossible
to
distinguish
*NL*
even
the
form
of
the
speaker
in
the
darkness
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Let
's
have
a
glim
,
'
said
Sikes
,
`
or
we
shall
go
breaking
our
necks
,
or
*NL*
treading
on
the
dog
.
Look
after
your
legs
if
you
do
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Stand
still
a
moment
,
and
I
'll
get
you
one
,
'
replied
the
voice
.
The
*NL*
receding
footsteps
of
the
speaker
were
heard
;
and
,
in
another
minute
,
*NL*
the
form
of
Mr.
John
Dawkins
,
otherwise
the
Artful
Dodger
,
appeared
.
*NL*
He
bore
in
his
right
hand
a
tallow
candle
stuck
in
the
end
of
a
cleft
*NL*
stick
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
gentleman
did
not
stop
to
bestow
any
other
mark
of
*NL*
recognition
upon
Oliver
than
a
humourous
grin
;
but
,
turning
away
,
*NL*
beckoned
the
visitors
to
follow
him
down
a
flight
of
stairs
.
They
*NL*
crossed
an
empty
kitchen
;
and
,
opening
the
door
of
a
low
*NL*
earthy-smelling
room
,
which
seemed
to
have
been
built
in
a
small
*NL*
back-yard
,
were
received
with
a
shout
of
laughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
,
my
wig
,
my
wig
!
'
cried
Master
Charles
Bates
,
from
whose
lungs
the
*NL*
laughter
had
proceeded
:
`
here
he
is
!
oh
,
cry
,
here
he
is
!
Oh
,
Fagin
,
*NL*
look
at
him
!
Fagin
,
do
look
at
him
!
I
ca
n't
bear
it
;
it
is
such
a
*NL*
jolly
game
,
I
cant
'
bear
it
.
Hold
me
,
somebody
,
while
I
laugh
it
out
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
With
this
irrepressible
ebullition
of
mirth
,
Master
Bates
laid
himself
*NL*
flat
on
the
floor
:
and
kicked
convulsively
for
five
minutes
,
in
an
*NL*
ectasy
of
facetious
joy
.
Then
jumping
to
his
feet
,
he
snatched
the
*NL*
cleft
stick
from
the
Dodger
;
and
,
advancing
to
Oliver
,
viewed
him
round
*NL*
and
round
;
while
the
Jew
,
taking
off
his
nightcap
,
made
a
great
number
*NL*
of
low
bows
to
the
bewildered
boy
.
The
Artful
,
meantime
,
who
was
of
a
*NL*
rather
saturnine
disposition
,
and
seldom
gave
way
to
merriment
when
it
*NL*
interfered
with
business
,
rifled
Oliver
's
pockets
with
steady
assiduity
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Look
at
his
togs
,
Fagin
!
'
said
Charley
,
putting
the
light
so
close
to
*NL*
his
new
jacket
as
nearly
to
set
him
on
fire
.
`
Look
at
his
togs
!
*NL*
Superfine
cloth
,
and
the
heavy
swell
cut
!
Oh
,
my
eye
,
what
a
game
!
*NL*
And
his
books
,
too
!
Nothing
but
a
gentleman
,
Fagin
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Delighted
to
see
you
looking
so
well
,
my
dear
,
'
said
the
Jew
,
bowing
*NL*
with
mock
humility
.
`
The
Artful
shall
give
you
another
suit
,
my
dear
,
*NL*
for
fear
you
should
spoil
that
Sunday
one
.
Why
did
n't
you
write
,
my
*NL*
dear
,
and
say
you
were
coming
?
We
'd
have
got
something
warm
for
*NL*
supper
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
At
his
,
Master
Bates
roared
again
:
so
loud
,
that
Fagin
himself
relaxed
,
*NL*
and
even
the
Dodger
smiled
;
but
as
the
Artful
drew
forth
the
five-pound
*NL*
note
at
that
instant
,
it
is
doubtful
whether
the
sally
of
the
discovery
*NL*
awakened
his
merriment
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Hallo
,
what
's
that
?
'
inquired
Sikes
,
stepping
forward
as
the
Jew
*NL*
seized
the
note
.
`
That
's
mine
,
Fagin
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
no
,
my
dear
,
'
said
the
Jew
.
`
Mine
,
Bill
,
mine
.
You
shall
have
*NL*
the
books
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
If
that
ai
n't
mine
!
'
said
Bill
Sikes
,
putting
on
his
hat
with
a
*NL*
determined
air
;
`
mine
and
Nancy
's
that
is
;
I
'll
take
the
boy
back
*NL*
again
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
Jew
started
.
Oliver
started
too
,
though
from
a
very
different
*NL*
cause
;
for
he
hoped
that
the
dispute
might
really
end
in
his
being
*NL*
taken
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Come
!
Hand
over
,
will
you
?
'
said
Sikes
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
This
is
hardly
fair
,
Bill
;
hardly
fair
,
is
it
,
Nancy
?
'
inquired
the
*NL*
Jew
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Fair
,
or
not
fair
,
'
retorted
Sikes
,
`
hand
over
,
I
tell
you
!
Do
you
*NL*
think
Nancy
and
me
has
got
nothing
else
to
do
with
our
precious
time
*NL*
but
to
spend
it
in
scouting
arter
,
and
kidnapping
,
every
young
boy
as
*NL*
gets
grabbed
through
you
?
Give
it
here
,
you
avaricious
old
skeleton
,
*NL*
give
it
here
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
With
this
gentle
remonstrance
,
Mr.
Sikes
plucked
the
note
from
between
*NL*
the
Jew
's
finger
and
thumb
;
and
looking
the
old
man
coolly
in
the
face
,
*NL*
folded
it
up
small
,
and
tied
it
in
his
neckerchief
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
's
for
our
share
of
the
trouble
,
'
said
Sikes
;
`
and
not
half
*NL*
enough
,
neither
.
You
may
keep
the
books
,
if
you
're
fond
of
reading
.
*NL*
If
you
ai
n't
,
sell
'em
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
They
're
very
pretty
,
'
said
Charley
Bates
:
who
,
with
sundry
grimaces
,
*NL*
had
been
affecting
to
read
one
of
the
volumes
in
question
;
`
beautiful
*NL*
writing
,
is
n't
is
,
Oliver
?
'
At
sight
of
the
dismayed
look
with
which
*NL*
Oliver
regarded
his
tormentors
,
Master
Bates
,
who
was
blessed
with
a
*NL*
lively
sense
of
the
ludicrous
,
fell
into
another
ectasy
,
more
*NL*
boisterous
than
the
first
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
They
belong
to
the
old
gentleman
,
'
said
Oliver
,
wringing
his
hands
;
*NL*
`
to
the
good
,
kind
,
old
gentleman
who
took
me
into
his
house
,
and
had
*NL*
me
nursed
,
when
I
was
near
dying
of
the
fever
.
Oh
,
pray
send
them
back
;
*NL*
send
him
back
the
books
and
money
.
Keep
me
here
all
my
life
long
;
but
*NL*
pray
,
pray
send
them
back
.
He
'll
think
I
stole
them
;
the
old
lady
:
*NL*
all
of
them
who
were
so
kind
to
me
:
will
think
I
stole
them
.
Oh
,
do
*NL*
have
mercy
upon
me
,
and
send
them
back
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
With
these
words
,
which
were
uttered
with
all
the
energy
of
passionate
*NL*
grief
,
Oliver
fell
upon
his
knees
at
the
Jew
's
feet
;
and
beat
his
hands
*NL*
together
,
in
perfect
desperation
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
boy
's
right
,
'
remarked
Fagin
,
looking
covertly
round
,
and
knitting
*NL*
his
shaggy
eyebrows
into
a
hard
knot
.
`
You
're
right
,
Oliver
,
you
're
*NL*
right
;
they
WILL
think
you
have
stolen
'em
.
Ha
!
ha
!
'
chuckled
the
Jew
,
*NL*
rubbing
his
hands
,
`
it
could
n't
have
happened
better
,
if
we
had
chosen
*NL*
our
time
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Of
course
it
could
n't
,
'
replied
Sikes
;
'
I
know
'd
that
,
directly
I
see
*NL*
him
coming
through
Clerkenwell
,
with
the
books
under
his
arm
.
It
's
all
*NL*
right
enough
.
They
're
soft-hearted
psalm-singers
,
or
they
would
n't
*NL*
have
taken
him
in
at
all
;
and
they
'll
ask
no
questions
after
him
,
fear
*NL*
they
should
be
obliged
to
prosecute
,
and
so
get
him
lagged
.
He
's
safe
*NL*
enough
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Oliver
had
looked
from
one
to
the
other
,
while
these
words
were
being
*NL*
spoken
,
as
if
he
were
bewildered
,
and
could
scarecely
understand
what
*NL*
passed
;
but
when
Bill
Sikes
concluded
,
he
jumped
suddenly
to
his
feet
,
*NL*
and
tore
wildly
from
the
room
:
uttering
shrieks
for
help
,
which
made
*NL*
the
bare
old
house
echo
to
the
roof
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Keep
back
the
dog
,
Bill
!
'
cried
Nancy
,
springing
before
the
door
,
and
*NL*
closing
it
,
as
the
Jew
and
his
two
pupils
darted
out
in
pursuit
.
`
Keep
*NL*
back
the
dog
;
he
'll
tear
the
boy
to
pieces
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Serve
him
right
!
'
cried
Sikes
,
struggling
to
disengage
himself
from
*NL*
the
girl
's
grasp
.
`
Stand
off
from
me
,
or
I
'll
split
your
head
against
*NL*
the
wall
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
do
n't
care
for
that
,
Bill
,
I
do
n't
care
for
that
,
'
screamed
the
*NL*
girl
,
struggling
violently
with
the
man
,
`
the
child
sha
n't
be
torn
down
*NL*
by
the
dog
,
unless
you
kill
me
first
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Sha
n't
he
!
'
said
Sikes
,
setting
his
teeth
.
`
I
'll
soon
do
that
,
if
you
*NL*
do
n't
keep
off
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
housebreaker
flung
the
girl
from
him
to
the
further
end
of
the
*NL*
room
,
just
as
the
Jew
and
the
two
boys
returned
,
dragging
Oliver
among
*NL*
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
's
the
matter
here
!
'
said
Fagin
,
looking
round
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
girl
's
gone
mad
,
I
think
,
'
replied
Sikes
,
savagely
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
she
has
n't
,
'
said
Nancy
,
pale
and
breathless
from
the
scuffle
;
*NL*
`
no
,
she
has
n't
,
Fagin
;
do
n't
think
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Then
keep
quiet
,
will
you
?
'
said
the
Jew
,
with
a
threatening
look
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
I
wo
n't
do
that
,
neither
,
'
replied
Nancy
,
speaking
very
loud
.
*NL*
`
Come
!
What
do
you
think
of
that
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Fagin
was
sufficiently
well
acquainted
with
the
manners
and
customs
*NL*
of
that
particular
species
of
humanity
to
which
Nancy
belonged
,
to
feel
*NL*
tolerably
certain
that
it
would
be
rather
unsafe
to
prolong
any
*NL*
conversation
with
her
,
at
present
.
With
the
view
of
diverting
the
*NL*
attention
of
the
company
,
he
turned
to
Oliver
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
So
you
wanted
to
get
away
,
my
dear
,
did
you
?
'
said
the
Jew
,
taking
up
*NL*
a
jagged
and
knotted
club
which
law
in
a
corner
of
the
fireplace
;
`
eh
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
Oliver
made
no
reply
.
But
he
watched
the
Jew
's
motions
,
and
breathed
*NL*
quickly
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Wanted
to
get
assistance
;
called
for
the
police
;
did
you
?
'
sneered
the
*NL*
Jew
,
catching
the
boy
by
the
arm
.
`
We
'll
cure
you
of
that
,
my
young
*NL*
master
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
Jew
inflicted
a
smart
blow
on
Oliver
's
shoulders
with
the
club
;
and
*NL*
was
raising
it
for
a
second
,
when
the
girl
,
rushing
forward
,
wrested
it
*NL*
from
his
hand
.
She
flung
it
into
the
fire
,
with
a
force
that
brought
*NL*
some
of
the
glowing
coals
whirling
out
into
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
wo
n't
stand
by
and
see
it
done
,
Fagin
,
'
cried
the
girl
.
`
You
've
got
*NL*
the
boy
,
and
what
more
would
you
have
?
--
Let
him
be
--
let
him
be
--
or
I
*NL*
shall
put
that
mark
on
some
of
you
,
that
will
bring
me
to
the
gallows
*NL*
before
my
time
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
girl
stamped
her
foot
violently
on
the
floor
as
she
vented
this
*NL*
threat
;
and
with
her
lips
compressed
,
and
her
hands
clenched
,
looked
*NL*
alternately
at
the
Jew
and
the
other
robber
:
her
face
quite
colourless
*NL*
from
the
passion
of
rage
into
which
she
had
gradually
worked
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
Nancy
!
'
said
the
Jew
,
in
a
soothing
tone
;
after
a
pause
,
during
*NL*
which
he
and
Mr.
Sikes
had
stared
at
one
another
in
a
disconcerted
*NL*
manner
;
`
you
,
--
you
're
more
clever
than
ever
to-night
.
Ha
!
ha
!
my
dear
,
*NL*
you
are
acting
beautifully
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Am
I
!
'
said
the
girl
.
`
Take
care
I
do
n't
overdo
it
.
You
will
be
the
*NL*
worse
for
it
,
Fagin
,
if
I
do
;
and
so
I
tell
you
in
good
time
to
keep
*NL*
clear
of
me
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
something
about
a
roused
woman
:
especially
if
she
add
to
all
*NL*
her
other
strong
passions
,
the
fierce
impulses
of
recklessness
and
*NL*
despair
;
which
few
men
like
to
provoke
.
The
Jew
saw
that
it
would
be
*NL*
hopeless
to
affect
any
further
mistake
regarding
the
reality
of
Miss
*NL*
Nancy
's
rage
;
and
,
shrinking
involuntarily
back
a
few
paces
,
cast
a
*NL*
glance
,
half
imploring
and
half
cowardly
,
at
Sikes
:
as
if
to
hint
that
*NL*
he
was
the
fittest
person
to
pursue
the
dialogue
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Sikes
,
thus
mutely
appealed
to
;
and
possibly
feeling
his
personal
*NL*
pride
and
influence
interested
in
the
immediate
reduction
of
Miss
Nancy
*NL*
to
reason
;
gave
utterance
to
about
a
couple
of
score
of
curses
and
*NL*
threats
,
the
rapid
production
of
which
reflected
great
credit
on
the
*NL*
fertility
of
his
invention
.
As
they
produced
no
visible
effect
on
the
*NL*
object
against
whom
they
were
discharged
,
however
,
he
resorted
to
more
*NL*
tangible
arguments
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
do
you
mean
by
this
?
'
said
Sikes
;
backing
the
inquiry
with
a
very
*NL*
common
imprecation
concerning
the
most
beautiful
of
human
features
:
*NL*
which
,
if
it
were
heard
above
,
only
once
out
of
every
fifty
thousand
*NL*
times
that
it
is
uttered
below
,
would
render
blindness
as
common
a
*NL*
disorder
as
measles
:
`
what
do
you
mean
by
it
?
Burn
my
body
!
Do
you
*NL*
know
who
you
are
,
and
what
you
are
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
,
yes
,
I
know
all
about
it
,
'
replied
the
girl
,
laughing
*NL*
hysterically
;
and
shaking
her
head
from
side
to
side
,
with
a
poor
*NL*
assumption
of
indifference
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
then
,
keep
quiet
,
'
rejoined
Sikes
,
with
a
growl
like
that
he
was
*NL*
accustomed
to
use
when
addressing
his
dog
,
`
or
I
'll
quiet
you
for
a
*NL*
good
long
time
to
come
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
girl
laughed
again
:
even
less
composedly
than
before
;
and
,
darting
*NL*
a
hasty
look
at
Sikes
,
turned
her
face
aside
,
and
bit
her
lip
till
the
*NL*
blood
came
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
're
a
nice
one
,
'
added
Sikes
,
as
he
surveyed
her
with
a
*NL*
contemptuous
air
,
`
to
take
up
the
humane
and
gen
--
teel
side
!
A
pretty
*NL*
subject
for
the
child
,
as
you
call
him
,
to
make
a
friend
of
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
God
Almighty
help
me
,
I
am
!
'
cried
the
girl
passionately
;
`
and
I
wish
*NL*
I
had
been
struck
dead
in
the
street
,
or
had
changed
places
with
them
*NL*
we
passed
so
near
to-night
,
before
I
had
lent
a
hand
in
bringing
him
*NL*
here
.
He
's
a
thief
,
a
liar
,
a
devil
,
all
that
's
bad
,
from
this
night
*NL*
forth
.
Is
n't
that
enough
for
the
old
wretch
,
without
blows
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Come
,
come
,
Sikes
,
'
said
the
Jew
appealing
to
him
in
a
remonstratory
*NL*
tone
,
and
motioning
towards
the
boys
,
who
were
eagerly
attentive
to
all
*NL*
that
passed
;
`
we
must
have
civil
words
;
civil
words
,
Bill
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Civil
words
!
'
cried
the
girl
,
whose
passion
was
frightful
to
see
.
*NL*
`
Civil
words
,
you
villain
!
Yes
,
you
deserve
'em
from
me
.
I
thieved
for
*NL*
you
when
I
was
a
child
not
half
as
old
as
this
!
'
pointing
to
Oliver
.
*NL*
'
I
have
been
in
the
same
trade
,
and
in
the
same
service
,
for
twelve
*NL*
years
since
.
Do
n't
you
know
it
?
Speak
out
!
Do
n't
you
know
it
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
well
,
'
replied
the
Jew
,
with
an
attempt
at
pacification
;
`
and
,
*NL*
if
you
have
,
it
's
your
living
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Aye
,
it
is
!
'
returned
the
girl
;
not
speaking
,
but
pouring
out
the
*NL*
words
in
one
continuous
and
vehement
scream
.
`
It
is
my
living
;
and
the
*NL*
cold
,
wet
,
dirty
streets
are
my
home
;
and
you
're
the
wretch
that
drove
*NL*
me
to
them
long
ago
,
and
that
'll
keep
me
there
,
day
and
night
,
day
and
*NL*
night
,
till
I
die
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
shall
do
you
a
mischief
!
'
interposed
the
Jew
,
goaded
by
these
*NL*
reproaches
;
'
a
mischief
worse
than
that
,
if
you
say
much
more
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
girl
said
nothing
more
;
but
,
tearing
her
hair
and
dress
in
a
*NL*
transport
of
passion
,
made
such
a
rush
at
the
Jew
as
would
probably
*NL*
have
left
signal
marks
of
her
revenge
upon
him
,
had
not
her
wrists
been
*NL*
seized
by
Sikes
at
the
right
moment
;
upon
which
,
she
made
a
few
*NL*
ineffectual
struggles
,
and
fainted
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
She
's
all
right
now
,
'
said
Sikes
,
laying
her
down
in
a
corner
.
`
She
's
*NL*
uncommon
strong
in
the
arms
,
when
she
's
up
in
this
way
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
Jew
wiped
his
forehead
:
and
smiled
,
as
if
it
were
a
relief
to
have
*NL*
the
disturbance
over
;
but
neither
he
,
nor
Sikes
,
nor
the
dog
,
nor
the
*NL*
boys
,
seemed
to
consider
it
in
any
other
light
than
a
common
occurance
*NL*
incidental
to
business
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
's
the
worst
of
having
to
do
with
women
,
'
said
the
Jew
,
replacing
*NL*
his
club
;
`
but
they
're
clever
,
and
we
ca
n't
get
on
,
in
our
line
,
*NL*
without
'em
.
Charley
,
show
Oliver
to
bed
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
suppose
he
'd
better
not
wear
his
best
clothes
tomorrow
,
Fagin
,
had
*NL*
he
?
'
inquired
Charley
Bates
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Certainly
not
,
'
replied
the
Jew
,
reciprocating
the
grin
with
which
*NL*
Charley
put
the
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
Master
Bates
,
apparently
much
delighted
with
his
commission
,
took
the
*NL*
cleft
stick
:
and
led
Oliver
into
an
adjacent
kitchen
,
where
there
were
*NL*
two
or
three
of
the
beds
on
which
he
had
slept
before
;
and
here
,
with
*NL*
many
uncontrollable
bursts
of
laughter
,
he
produced
the
identical
old
*NL*
suit
of
clothes
which
Oliver
had
so
much
congratulated
himself
upon
*NL*
leaving
off
at
Mr.
Brownlow
's
;
and
the
accidental
display
of
which
,
to
*NL*
Fagin
,
by
the
Jew
who
purchased
them
,
had
been
the
very
first
clue
*NL*
received
,
of
his
whereabout
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Put
off
the
smart
ones
,
'
said
Charley
,
`
and
I
'll
give
'em
to
Fagin
to
*NL*
take
care
of
.
What
fun
it
is
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Oliver
unwillingly
complied
.
Master
Bates
rolling
up
the
new
*NL*
clothes
under
his
arm
,
departed
from
the
room
,
leaving
Oliver
in
the
*NL*
dark
,
and
locking
the
door
behind
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
noise
of
Charley
's
laughter
,
and
the
voice
of
Miss
Betsy
,
who
*NL*
opportunely
arrived
to
throw
water
over
her
friend
,
and
perform
other
*NL*
feminine
offices
for
the
promotion
of
her
recovery
,
might
have
kept
*NL*
many
people
awake
under
more
happy
circumstances
than
those
in
which
*NL*
Oliver
was
placed
.
But
he
was
sick
and
weary
;
and
he
soon
fell
sound
*NL*
asleep
.

CHAPTER
XVII
*NL*
*NL*
OLIVER
'S
DESTINY
CONTINUING
UNPROPITIOUS
,
BRINGS
A
GREAT
MAN
TO
LONDON
*NL*
TO
INJURE
HIS
REPUTATION
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
the
custom
on
the
stage
,
in
all
good
murderous
melodramas
,
to
*NL*
present
the
tragic
and
the
comic
scenes
,
in
as
regular
alternation
,
as
*NL*
the
layers
of
red
and
white
in
a
side
of
streaky
bacon
.
The
hero
sinks
*NL*
upon
his
straw
bed
,
weighed
down
by
fetters
and
misfortunes
;
in
the
*NL*
next
scene
,
his
faithful
but
unconscious
squire
regales
the
audience
*NL*
with
a
comic
song
.
We
behold
,
with
throbbing
bosoms
,
the
heroine
in
*NL*
the
grasp
of
a
proud
and
ruthless
baron
:
her
virtue
and
her
life
alike
*NL*
in
danger
,
drawing
forth
her
dagger
to
preserve
the
one
at
the
cost
of
*NL*
the
other
;
and
just
as
our
expectations
are
wrought
up
to
the
highest
*NL*
pitch
,
a
whistle
is
heard
,
and
we
are
straightway
transported
to
the
*NL*
great
hall
of
the
castle
;
where
a
grey-headed
seneschal
sings
a
funny
*NL*
chorus
with
a
funnier
body
of
vassals
,
who
are
free
of
all
sorts
of
*NL*
places
,
from
church
vaults
to
palaces
,
and
roam
about
in
company
,
*NL*
carolling
perpetually
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
changes
appear
absurd
;
but
they
are
not
so
unnatural
as
they
would
*NL*
seem
at
first
sight
.
The
transitions
in
real
life
from
well-spread
*NL*
boards
to
death-beds
,
and
from
mourning-weeds
to
holiday
garments
,
are
*NL*
not
a
whit
less
startling
;
only
,
there
,
we
are
busy
actors
,
instead
of
*NL*
passive
lookers-on
,
which
makes
a
vast
difference
.
The
actors
in
the
*NL*
mimic
life
of
the
theatre
,
are
blind
to
violent
transitions
and
abrupt
*NL*
impulses
of
passion
or
feeling
,
which
,
presented
before
the
eyes
of
*NL*
mere
spectators
,
are
at
once
condemned
as
outrageous
and
preposterous
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
sudden
shiftings
of
the
scene
,
and
rapid
changes
of
time
and
place
,
*NL*
are
not
only
sanctioned
in
books
by
long
usage
,
but
are
by
many
*NL*
considered
as
the
great
art
of
authorship
:
an
author
's
skill
in
his
*NL*
craft
being
,
by
such
critics
,
chiefly
estimated
with
relation
to
the
*NL*
dilemmas
in
which
he
leaves
his
characters
at
the
end
of
every
chapter
:
*NL*
this
brief
introduction
to
the
present
one
may
perhaps
be
deemed
*NL*
unnecessary
.
If
so
,
let
it
be
considered
a
delicate
intimation
on
the
*NL*
part
of
the
historian
that
he
is
going
back
to
the
town
in
which
Oliver
*NL*
Twist
was
born
;
the
reader
taking
it
for
granted
that
there
are
good
*NL*
and
substantial
reasons
for
making
the
journey
,
or
he
would
not
be
*NL*
invited
to
proceed
upon
such
an
expedition
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bumble
emerged
at
early
morning
from
the
workhouse-gate
,
and
walked
*NL*
with
portly
carriage
and
commanding
steps
,
up
the
High
Street
.
He
was
*NL*
in
the
full
bloom
and
pride
of
beadlehood
;
his
cocked
hat
and
coat
were
*NL*
dazzling
in
the
morning
sun
;
he
clutched
his
cane
with
the
vigorous
*NL*
tenacity
of
health
and
power
.
Mr.
Bumble
always
carried
his
head
high
;
*NL*
but
this
morning
it
was
higher
than
usual
.
There
was
an
abstraction
in
*NL*
his
eye
,
an
elevation
in
his
air
,
which
might
have
warned
an
observant
*NL*
stranger
that
thoughts
were
passing
in
the
beadle
's
mind
,
too
great
for
*NL*
utterance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bumble
stopped
not
to
converse
with
the
small
shopkeepers
and
*NL*
others
who
spoke
to
him
,
deferentially
,
as
he
passed
along
.
He
merely
*NL*
returned
their
salutations
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
,
and
relaxed
not
in
*NL*
his
dignified
pace
,
until
he
reached
the
farm
where
Mrs.
Mann
tended
*NL*
the
infant
paupers
with
parochial
care
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Drat
that
beadle
!
'
said
Mrs.
Mann
,
hearing
the
well-known
shaking
at
*NL*
the
garden-gate
.
`
If
it
is
n't
him
at
this
time
in
the
morning
!
Lauk
,
*NL*
Mr.
Bumble
,
only
think
of
its
being
you
!
Well
,
dear
me
,
it
IS
a
*NL*
pleasure
,
this
is
!
Come
into
the
parlour
,
sir
,
please
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
sentence
was
addressed
to
Susan
;
and
the
exclamations
of
*NL*
delight
were
uttered
to
Mr.
Bumble
:
as
the
good
lady
unlocked
the
*NL*
garden-gate
:
and
showed
him
,
with
great
attention
and
respect
,
into
the
*NL*
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Mrs.
Mann
,
'
said
Mr.
Bumble
;
not
sitting
upon
,
or
dropping
himself
*NL*
into
a
seat
,
as
any
common
jackanapes
would
:
but
letting
himself
*NL*
gradually
and
slowly
down
into
a
chair
;
`
Mrs.
Mann
,
ma'am
,
good
*NL*
morning
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
and
good
morning
to
_
you
_
,
sir
,
'
replied
Mrs.
Mann
,
with
many
*NL*
smiles
;
`
and
hoping
you
find
yourself
well
,
sir
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
So-so
,
Mrs.
Mann
,
'
replied
the
beadle
.
'
A
porochial
life
is
not
a
bed
*NL*
of
roses
,
Mrs.
Mann
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ah
,
that
it
is
n't
indeed
,
Mr.
Bumble
,
'
rejoined
the
lady
.
And
all
the
*NL*
infant
paupers
might
have
chorussed
the
rejoinder
with
great
propriety
,
*NL*
if
they
had
heard
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
A
porochial
life
,
ma'am
,
'
continued
Mr.
Bumble
,
striking
the
table
*NL*
with
his
cane
,
`
is
a
life
of
worrit
,
and
vexation
,
and
hardihood
;
but
*NL*
all
public
characters
,
as
I
may
say
,
must
suffer
prosecution
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Mann
,
not
very
well
knowing
what
the
beadle
meant
,
raised
her
*NL*
hands
with
a
look
of
sympathy
,
and
sighed
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ah
!
You
may
well
sigh
,
Mrs.
Mann
!
'
said
the
beadle
.
*NL*
*NL*
Finding
she
had
done
right
,
Mrs.
Mann
sighed
again
:
evidently
to
the
*NL*
satisfaction
of
the
public
character
:
who
,
repressing
a
complacent
*NL*
smile
by
looking
sternly
at
his
cocked
hat
,
said
,
*NL*
*NL*
`
Mrs.
Mann
,
I
am
going
to
London
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Lauk
,
Mr.
Bumble
!
'
cried
Mrs.
Mann
,
starting
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
To
London
,
ma'am
,
'
resumed
the
inflexible
beadle
,
`
by
coach
.
I
and
*NL*
two
paupers
,
Mrs.
Mann
!
A
legal
action
is
a
coming
on
,
about
a
*NL*
settlement
;
and
the
board
has
appointed
me
--
me
,
Mrs.
Mann
--
to
dispose
*NL*
to
the
matter
before
the
quarter-sessions
at
Clerkinwell
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
I
very
much
question
,
'
added
Mr.
Bumble
,
drawing
himself
up
,
*NL*
`
whether
the
Clerkinwell
Sessions
will
not
find
themselves
in
the
wrong
*NL*
box
before
they
have
done
with
me
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
!
you
must
n't
be
too
hard
upon
them
,
sir
,
'
said
Mrs.
Mann
,
coaxingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
Clerkinwell
Sessions
have
brought
it
upon
themselves
,
ma'am
,
'
*NL*
replied
Mr.
Bumble
;
`
and
if
the
Clerkinwell
Sessions
find
that
they
*NL*
come
off
rather
worse
than
they
expected
,
the
Clerkinwell
Sessions
have
*NL*
only
themselves
to
thank
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
so
much
determination
and
depth
of
purpose
about
the
menacing
*NL*
manner
in
which
Mr.
Bumble
delivered
himself
of
these
words
,
that
Mrs.
*NL*
Mann
appeared
quite
awed
by
them
.
At
length
she
said
,
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
're
going
by
coach
,
sir
?
I
thought
it
was
always
usual
to
send
*NL*
them
paupers
in
carts
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
's
when
they
're
ill
,
Mrs.
Mann
,
'
said
the
beadle
.
`
We
put
the
*NL*
sick
paupers
into
open
carts
in
the
rainy
weather
,
to
prevent
their
*NL*
taking
cold
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
!
'
said
Mrs.
Mann
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
opposition
coach
contracts
for
these
two
;
and
takes
them
cheap
,
'
*NL*
said
Mr.
Bumble
.
`
They
are
both
in
a
very
low
state
,
and
we
find
it
*NL*
would
come
two
pound
cheaper
to
move
'em
than
to
bury
'em
--
that
is
,
if
*NL*
we
can
throw
'em
upon
another
parish
,
which
I
think
we
shall
be
able
to
*NL*
do
,
if
they
do
n't
die
upon
the
road
to
spite
us
.
Ha
!
ha
!
ha
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
When
Mr.
Bumble
had
laughed
a
little
while
,
his
eyes
again
encountered
*NL*
the
cocked
hat
;
and
he
became
grave
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
We
are
forgetting
business
,
ma'am
,
'
said
the
beadle
;
`
here
is
your
*NL*
porochial
stipend
for
the
month
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bumble
produced
some
silver
money
rolled
up
in
paper
,
from
his
*NL*
pocket-book
;
and
requested
a
receipt
:
which
Mrs.
Mann
wrote
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
's
very
much
blotted
,
sir
,
'
said
the
farmer
of
infants
;
`
but
it
's
*NL*
formal
enough
,
I
dare
say
.
Thank
you
,
Mr.
Bumble
,
sir
,
I
am
very
much
*NL*
obliged
to
you
,
I
'm
sure
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bumble
nodded
,
blandly
,
in
acknowledgment
of
Mrs.
Mann
's
curtsey
;
*NL*
and
inquired
how
the
children
were
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Bless
their
dear
little
hearts
!
'
said
Mrs.
Mann
with
emotion
,
`
they
're
*NL*
as
well
as
can
be
,
the
dears
!
Of
course
,
except
the
two
that
died
last
*NL*
week
.
And
little
Dick
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Is
n't
that
boy
no
better
?
'
inquired
Mr.
Bumble
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Mann
shook
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
's
a
ill-conditioned
,
wicious
,
bad-disposed
porochial
child
that
,
'
*NL*
said
Mr.
Bumble
angrily
.
`
Where
is
he
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
'll
bring
him
to
you
in
one
minute
,
sir
,
'
replied
Mrs.
Mann
.
`
Here
,
*NL*
you
Dick
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
After
some
calling
,
Dick
was
discovered
.
Having
had
his
face
put
under
*NL*
the
pump
,
and
dried
upon
Mrs.
Mann
's
gown
,
he
was
led
into
the
awful
*NL*
presence
of
Mr.
Bumble
,
the
beadle
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
child
was
pale
and
thin
;
his
cheeks
were
sunken
;
and
his
eyes
large
*NL*
and
bright
.
The
scanty
parish
dress
,
the
livery
of
his
misery
,
hung
*NL*
loosely
on
his
feeble
body
;
and
his
young
limbs
had
wasted
away
,
like
*NL*
those
of
an
old
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
was
the
little
being
who
stood
trembling
beneath
Mr.
Bumble
's
*NL*
glance
;
not
daring
to
lift
his
eyes
from
the
floor
;
and
dreading
even
*NL*
to
hear
the
beadle
's
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ca
n't
you
look
at
the
gentleman
,
you
obstinate
boy
?
'
said
Mrs.
Mann
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
child
meekly
raised
his
eyes
,
and
encountered
those
of
Mr.
Bumble
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
's
the
matter
with
you
,
porochial
Dick
?
'
inquired
Mr.
Bumble
,
with
*NL*
well-timed
jocularity
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Nothing
,
sir
,
'
replied
the
child
faintly
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
should
think
not
,
'
said
Mrs.
Mann
,
who
had
of
course
laughed
very
*NL*
much
at
Mr.
Bumble
's
humour
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
want
for
nothing
,
I
'm
sure
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
should
like
--
'
faltered
the
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Hey-day
!
'
interposed
Mr.
Mann
,
'
I
suppose
you
're
going
to
say
that
you
*NL*
DO
want
for
something
,
now
?
Why
,
you
little
wretch
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Stop
,
Mrs.
Mann
,
stop
!
'
said
the
beadle
,
raising
his
hand
with
a
show
*NL*
of
authority
.
`
Like
what
,
sir
,
eh
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
should
like
,
'
faltered
the
child
,
`
if
somebody
that
can
write
,
would
*NL*
put
a
few
words
down
for
me
on
a
piece
of
paper
,
and
fold
it
up
and
*NL*
seal
it
,
and
keep
it
for
me
,
after
I
am
laid
in
the
ground
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
what
does
the
boy
mean
?
'
exclaimed
Mr.
Bumble
,
on
whom
the
*NL*
earnest
manner
and
wan
aspect
of
the
child
had
made
some
impression
:
*NL*
accustomed
as
he
was
to
such
things
.
`
What
do
you
mean
,
sir
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
should
like
,
'
said
the
child
,
`
to
leave
my
dear
love
to
poor
Oliver
*NL*
Twist
;
and
to
let
him
know
how
often
I
have
sat
by
myself
and
cried
to
*NL*
think
of
his
wandering
about
in
the
dark
nights
with
nobody
to
help
*NL*
him
.
And
I
should
like
to
tell
him
,
'
said
the
child
pressing
his
small
*NL*
hands
together
,
and
speaking
with
great
fervour
,
`
that
I
was
glad
to
*NL*
die
when
I
was
very
young
;
for
,
perhaps
,
if
I
had
lived
to
be
a
man
,
*NL*
and
had
grown
old
,
my
little
sister
who
is
in
Heaven
,
might
forget
me
,
*NL*
or
be
unlike
me
;
and
it
would
be
so
much
happier
if
we
were
both
*NL*
children
there
together
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bumble
surveyed
the
little
speaker
,
from
head
to
foot
,
with
*NL*
indescribable
astonishment
;
and
,
turning
to
his
companion
,
said
,
*NL*
`
They
're
all
in
one
story
,
Mrs.
Mann
.
That
out-dacious
Oliver
had
*NL*
demogalized
them
all
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
could
n't
have
believed
it
,
sir
'
said
Mrs
Mann
,
holding
up
her
hands
,
*NL*
and
looking
malignantly
at
Dick
.
'
I
never
see
such
a
hardened
little
*NL*
wretch
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Take
him
away
,
ma'am
!
'
said
Mr.
Bumble
imperiously
.
`
This
must
be
*NL*
stated
to
the
board
,
Mrs.
Mann
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
hope
the
gentleman
will
understand
that
it
is
n't
my
fault
,
sir
?
'
*NL*
said
Mrs.
Mann
,
whimpering
pathetically
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
They
shall
understand
that
,
ma'am
;
they
shall
be
acquainted
with
the
*NL*
true
state
of
the
case
,
'
said
Mr.
Bumble
.
`
There
;
take
him
away
,
I
*NL*
ca
n't
bear
the
sight
on
him
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Dick
was
immediately
taken
away
,
and
locked
up
in
the
coal-cellar
.
Mr.
*NL*
Bumble
shortly
afterwards
took
himself
off
,
to
prepare
for
his
journey
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
six
o'clock
next
morning
,
Mr.
Bumble
:
having
exchanged
his
cocked
*NL*
hat
for
a
round
one
,
and
encased
his
person
in
a
blue
great-coat
with
a
*NL*
cape
to
it
:
took
his
place
on
the
outside
of
the
coach
,
accompanied
by
*NL*
the
criminals
whose
settlement
was
disputed
;
with
whom
,
in
due
course
*NL*
of
time
,
he
arrived
in
London
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
experienced
no
other
crosses
on
the
way
,
than
those
which
originated
*NL*
in
the
perverse
behaviour
of
the
two
paupers
,
who
persisted
in
*NL*
shivering
,
and
complaining
of
the
cold
,
in
a
manner
which
,
Mr.
Bumble
*NL*
declared
,
caused
his
teeth
to
chatter
in
his
head
,
and
made
him
feel
*NL*
quite
uncomfortable
;
although
he
had
a
great-coat
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
disposed
of
these
evil-minded
persons
for
the
night
,
Mr.
Bumble
*NL*
sat
himself
down
in
the
house
at
which
the
coach
stopped
;
and
took
a
*NL*
temperate
dinner
of
steaks
,
oyster
sauce
,
and
porter
.
Putting
a
glass
*NL*
of
hot
gin-and-water
on
the
chimney-piece
,
he
drew
his
chair
to
the
*NL*
fire
;
and
,
with
sundry
moral
reflections
on
the
too-prevalent
sin
of
*NL*
discontent
and
complaining
,
composed
himself
to
read
the
paper
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
very
first
paragraph
upon
which
Mr.
Bumble
's
eye
rested
,
was
the
*NL*
following
advertisement
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
FIVE
GUINEAS
REWARD
*NL*
*NL*
`
Whereas
a
young
boy
,
named
Oliver
Twist
,
absconded
,
or
was
enticed
,
on
*NL*
Thursday
evening
last
,
from
his
home
,
at
Pentonville
;
and
has
not
since
*NL*
been
heard
of
.
The
above
reward
will
be
paid
to
any
person
who
will
*NL*
give
such
information
as
will
lead
to
the
discovery
of
the
said
Oliver
*NL*
Twist
,
or
tend
to
throw
any
light
upon
his
previous
history
,
in
which
*NL*
the
advertiser
is
,
for
many
reasons
,
warmly
interested
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
followed
a
full
description
of
Oliver
's
dress
,
person
,
*NL*
appearance
,
and
disappearance
:
with
the
name
and
address
of
Mr.
*NL*
Brownlow
at
full
length
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bumble
opened
his
eyes
;
read
the
advertisement
,
slowly
and
*NL*
carefully
,
three
several
times
;
and
in
something
more
than
five
minutes
*NL*
was
on
his
way
to
Pentonville
:
having
actually
,
in
his
excitement
,
left
*NL*
the
glass
of
hot
gin-and-water
,
untasted
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Is
Mr.
Brownlow
at
home
?
'
inquired
Mr.
Bumble
of
the
girl
who
opened
*NL*
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
this
inquiry
the
girl
returned
the
not
uncommon
,
but
rather
evasive
*NL*
reply
of
'
I
do
n't
know
;
where
do
you
come
from
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bumble
no
sooner
uttered
Oliver
's
name
,
in
explanation
of
his
*NL*
errand
,
than
Mrs.
Bedwin
,
who
had
been
listening
at
the
parlour
door
,
*NL*
hastened
into
the
passage
in
a
breathless
state
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Come
in
,
come
in
,
'
said
the
old
lady
:
'
I
knew
we
should
hear
of
him
.
*NL*
Poor
dear
!
I
knew
we
should
!
I
was
certain
of
it
.
Bless
his
heart
!
*NL*
I
said
so
all
along
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Having
heard
this
,
the
worthy
old
lady
hurried
back
into
the
parlour
*NL*
again
;
and
seating
herself
on
a
sofa
,
burst
into
tears
.
The
girl
,
who
*NL*
was
not
quite
so
susceptible
,
had
run
upstairs
meanwhile
;
and
now
*NL*
returned
with
a
request
that
Mr.
Bumble
would
follow
her
immediately
:
*NL*
which
he
did
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
shown
into
the
little
back
study
,
where
sat
Mr.
Brownlow
and
his
*NL*
friend
Mr.
Grimwig
,
with
decanters
and
glasses
before
them
.
The
latter
*NL*
gentleman
at
once
burst
into
the
exclamation
:
*NL*
*NL*
'
A
beadle
.
A
parish
beadle
,
or
I
'll
eat
my
head
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Pray
do
n't
interrupt
just
now
,
'
said
Mr.
Brownlow
.
`
Take
a
seat
,
will
*NL*
you
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bumble
sat
himself
down
;
quite
confounded
by
the
oddity
of
Mr.
*NL*
Grimwig
's
manner
.
Mr.
Brownlow
moved
the
lamp
,
so
as
to
obtain
an
*NL*
uninterrupted
view
of
the
beadle
's
countenance
;
and
said
,
with
a
little
*NL*
impatience
,
*NL*
*NL*
`
Now
,
sir
,
you
come
in
consequence
of
having
seen
the
advertisement
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
sir
,
'
said
Mr.
Bumble
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
you
ARE
a
beadle
,
are
you
not
?
'
inquired
Mr.
Grimwig
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
am
a
porochial
beadle
,
gentlemen
,
'
rejoined
Mr.
Bumble
proudly
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Of
course
,
'
observed
Mr.
Grimwig
aside
to
his
friend
,
'
I
knew
he
was
.
*NL*
A
beadle
all
over
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Brownlow
gently
shook
his
head
to
impose
silence
on
his
friend
,
and
*NL*
resumed
:
*NL*
*NL*
`
Do
you
know
where
this
poor
boy
is
now
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
more
than
nobody
,
'
replied
Mr.
Bumble
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
what
DO
you
know
of
him
?
'
inquired
the
old
gentleman
.
`
Speak
*NL*
out
,
my
friend
,
if
you
have
anything
to
say
.
What
DO
you
know
of
him
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
do
n't
happen
to
know
any
good
of
him
,
do
you
?
'
said
Mr.
Grimwig
,
*NL*
caustically
;
after
an
attentive
perusal
of
Mr.
Bumble
's
features
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bumble
,
catching
at
the
inquiry
very
quickly
,
shook
his
head
with
*NL*
portentous
solemnity
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
see
?
'
said
Mr.
Grimwig
,
looking
triumphantly
at
Mr.
Brownlow
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Brownlow
looked
apprehensively
at
Mr.
Bumble
's
pursed-up
*NL*
countenance
;
and
requested
him
to
communicate
what
he
knew
regarding
*NL*
Oliver
,
in
as
few
words
as
possible
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bumble
put
down
his
hat
;
unbuttoned
his
coat
;
folded
his
arms
;
*NL*
inclined
his
head
in
a
retrospective
manner
;
and
,
after
a
few
moments
'
*NL*
reflection
,
commenced
his
story
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
would
be
tedious
if
given
in
the
beadle
's
words
:
occupying
,
as
it
*NL*
did
,
some
twenty
minutes
in
the
telling
;
but
the
sum
and
substance
of
*NL*
it
was
,
that
Oliver
was
a
foundling
,
born
of
low
and
vicious
parents
.
*NL*
That
he
had
,
from
his
birth
,
displayed
no
better
qualities
than
*NL*
treachery
,
ingratitude
,
and
malice
.
That
he
had
terminated
his
brief
*NL*
career
in
the
place
of
his
birth
,
by
making
a
sanguinary
and
cowardly
*NL*
attack
on
an
unoffending
lad
,
and
running
away
in
the
night-time
from
*NL*
his
master
's
house
.
In
proof
of
his
really
being
the
person
he
*NL*
represented
himself
,
Mr.
Bumble
laid
upon
the
table
the
papers
he
had
*NL*
brought
to
town
.
Folding
his
arms
again
,
he
then
awaited
Mr.
Brownlow
's
*NL*
observations
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
fear
it
is
all
too
true
,
'
said
the
old
gentleman
sorrowfully
,
after
*NL*
looking
over
the
papers
.
`
This
is
not
much
for
your
intelligence
;
but
*NL*
I
would
gladly
have
given
you
treble
the
money
,
if
it
had
been
*NL*
favourable
to
the
boy
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
not
improbable
that
if
Mr.
Bumble
had
been
possessed
of
this
*NL*
information
at
an
earlier
period
of
the
interview
,
he
might
have
*NL*
imparted
a
very
different
colouring
to
his
little
history
.
It
was
too
*NL*
late
to
do
it
now
,
however
;
so
he
shook
his
head
gravely
,
and
,
*NL*
pocketing
the
five
guineas
,
withdrew
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Brownlow
paced
the
room
to
and
fro
for
some
minutes
;
evidently
so
*NL*
much
disturbed
by
the
beadle
's
tale
,
that
even
Mr.
Grimwig
forbore
to
*NL*
vex
him
further
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
he
stopped
,
and
rang
the
bell
violently
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Mrs.
Bedwin
,
'
said
Mr.
Brownlow
,
when
the
housekeeper
appeared
;
`
that
*NL*
boy
,
Oliver
,
is
an
imposter
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
ca
n't
be
,
sir
.
It
can
not
be
,
'
said
the
old
lady
energetically
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
tell
you
he
is
,
'
retorted
the
old
gentleman
.
`
What
do
you
mean
by
*NL*
ca
n't
be
?
We
have
just
heard
a
full
account
of
him
from
his
birth
;
and
*NL*
he
has
been
a
thorough-paced
little
villain
,
all
his
life
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
never
will
believe
it
,
sir
,
'
replied
the
old
lady
,
firmly
.
`
Never
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
old
women
never
believe
anything
but
quack-doctors
,
and
lying
*NL*
story-books
,
'
growled
Mr.
Grimwig
.
'
I
knew
it
all
along
.
Why
did
n't
*NL*
you
take
my
advise
in
the
beginning
;
you
would
if
he
had
n't
had
a
*NL*
fever
,
I
suppose
,
eh
?
He
was
interesting
,
was
n't
he
?
Interesting
!
*NL*
Bah
!
'
And
Mr.
Grimwig
poked
the
fire
with
a
flourish
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
was
a
dear
,
grateful
,
gentle
child
,
sir
,
'
retorted
Mrs.
Bedwin
,
*NL*
indignantly
.
'
I
know
what
children
are
,
sir
;
and
have
done
these
forty
*NL*
years
;
and
people
who
ca
n't
say
the
same
,
should
n't
say
anything
about
*NL*
them
.
That
's
my
opinion
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
a
hard
hit
at
Mr.
Grimwig
,
who
was
a
bachelor
.
As
it
extorted
*NL*
nothing
from
that
gentleman
but
a
smile
,
the
old
lady
tossed
her
head
,
*NL*
and
smoothed
down
her
apron
preparatory
to
another
speech
,
when
she
was
*NL*
stopped
by
Mr.
Brownlow
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Silence
!
'
said
the
old
gentleman
,
feigning
an
anger
he
was
far
from
*NL*
feeling
.
`
Never
let
me
hear
the
boy
's
name
again
.
I
rang
to
tell
you
*NL*
that
.
Never
.
Never
,
on
any
pretence
,
mind
!
You
may
leave
the
room
,
*NL*
Mrs.
Bedwin
.
Remember
!
I
am
in
earnest
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
sad
hearts
at
Mr.
Brownlow
's
that
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oliver
's
heart
sank
within
him
,
when
he
thought
of
his
good
friends
;
it
*NL*
was
well
for
him
that
he
could
not
know
what
they
had
heard
,
or
it
*NL*
might
have
broken
outright
.

CHAPTER
XVIII
*NL*
*NL*
HOW
OLIVER
PASSED
HIS
TIME
IN
THE
IMPROVING
SOCIETY
OF
HIS
REPUTABLE
*NL*
FRIENDS
*NL*
*NL*
About
noon
next
day
,
when
the
Dodger
and
Master
Bates
had
gone
out
to
*NL*
pursue
their
customary
avocations
,
Mr.
Fagin
took
the
opportunity
of
*NL*
reading
Oliver
a
long
lecture
on
the
crying
sin
of
ingratitude
;
of
*NL*
which
he
clearly
demonstrated
he
had
been
guilty
,
to
no
ordinary
*NL*
extent
,
in
wilfully
absenting
himself
from
the
society
of
his
anxious
*NL*
friends
;
and
,
still
more
,
in
endeavouring
to
escape
from
them
after
so
*NL*
much
trouble
and
expense
had
been
incurred
in
his
recovery
.
Mr.
Fagin
*NL*
laid
great
stress
on
the
fact
of
his
having
taken
Oliver
in
,
and
*NL*
cherished
him
,
when
,
without
his
timely
aid
,
he
might
have
perished
*NL*
with
hunger
;
and
he
related
the
dismal
and
affecting
history
of
a
young
*NL*
lad
whom
,
in
his
philanthropy
,
he
had
succoured
under
parallel
*NL*
circumstances
,
but
who
,
proving
unworthy
of
his
confidence
and
evincing
*NL*
a
desire
to
communicate
with
the
police
,
had
unfortunately
come
to
be
*NL*
hanged
at
the
Old
Bailey
one
morning
.
Mr.
Fagin
did
not
seek
to
*NL*
conceal
his
share
in
the
catastrophe
,
but
lamented
with
tears
in
his
*NL*
eyes
that
the
wrong-headed
and
treacherous
behaviour
of
the
young
*NL*
person
in
question
,
had
rendered
it
necessary
that
he
should
become
the
*NL*
victim
of
certain
evidence
for
the
crown
:
which
,
if
it
were
not
*NL*
precisely
true
,
was
indispensably
necessary
for
the
safety
of
him
-LRB-
Mr.
*NL*
Fagin
-RRB-
and
a
few
select
friends
.
Mr.
Fagin
concluded
by
drawing
a
*NL*
rather
disagreeable
picture
of
the
discomforts
of
hanging
;
and
,
with
*NL*
great
friendliness
and
politeness
of
manner
,
expressed
his
anxious
*NL*
hopes
that
he
might
never
be
obliged
to
submit
Oliver
Twist
to
that
*NL*
unpleasant
operation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Little
Oliver
's
blood
ran
cold
,
as
he
listened
to
the
Jew
's
words
,
and
*NL*
imperfectly
comprehended
the
dark
threats
conveyed
in
them
.
That
it
*NL*
was
possible
even
for
justice
itself
to
confound
the
innocent
with
the
*NL*
guilty
when
they
were
in
accidental
companionship
,
he
knew
already
;
and
*NL*
that
deeply-laid
plans
for
the
destruction
of
inconveniently
knowing
or
*NL*
over-communicative
persons
,
had
been
really
devised
and
carried
out
by
*NL*
the
Jew
on
more
occasions
than
one
,
he
thought
by
no
means
unlikely
,
*NL*
when
he
recollected
the
general
nature
of
the
altercations
between
that
*NL*
gentleman
and
Mr.
Sikes
:
which
seemed
to
bear
reference
to
some
*NL*
foregone
conspiracy
of
the
kind
.
As
he
glanced
timidly
up
,
and
met
the
*NL*
Jew
's
searching
look
,
he
felt
that
his
pale
face
and
trembling
limbs
*NL*
were
neither
unnoticed
nor
unrelished
by
that
wary
old
gentleman
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Jew
,
smiling
hideously
,
patted
Oliver
on
the
head
,
and
said
,
that
*NL*
if
he
kept
himself
quiet
,
and
applied
himself
to
business
,
he
saw
they
*NL*
would
be
very
good
friends
yet
.
Then
,
taking
his
hat
,
and
covering
*NL*
himself
with
an
old
patched
great-coat
,
he
went
out
,
and
locked
the
*NL*
room-door
behind
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
Oliver
remained
all
that
day
,
and
for
the
greater
part
of
many
*NL*
subsequent
days
,
seeing
nobody
,
between
early
morning
and
midnight
,
and
*NL*
left
during
the
long
hours
to
commune
with
his
own
thoughts
.
Which
,
*NL*
never
failing
to
revert
to
his
kind
friends
,
and
the
opinion
they
must
*NL*
long
ago
have
formed
of
him
,
were
sad
indeed
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
lapse
of
a
week
or
so
,
the
Jew
left
the
room-door
unlocked
;
*NL*
and
he
was
at
liberty
to
wander
about
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
very
dirty
place
.
The
rooms
upstairs
had
great
high
wooden
*NL*
chimney-pieces
and
large
doors
,
with
panelled
walls
and
cornices
to
the
*NL*
ceiling
;
which
,
although
they
were
black
with
neglect
and
dust
,
were
*NL*
ornamented
in
various
ways
.
From
all
of
these
tokens
Oliver
concluded
*NL*
that
a
long
time
ago
,
before
the
old
Jew
was
born
,
it
had
belonged
to
*NL*
better
people
,
and
had
perhaps
been
quite
gay
and
handsome
:
dismal
and
*NL*
dreary
as
it
looked
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
Spiders
had
built
their
webs
in
the
angles
of
the
walls
and
ceilings
;
*NL*
and
sometimes
,
when
Oliver
walked
softly
into
a
room
,
the
mice
would
*NL*
scamper
across
the
floor
,
and
run
back
terrified
to
their
holes
.
With
*NL*
these
exceptions
,
there
was
neither
sight
nor
sound
of
any
living
*NL*
thing
;
and
often
,
when
it
grew
dark
,
and
he
was
tired
of
wandering
from
*NL*
room
to
room
,
he
would
crouch
in
the
corner
of
the
passage
by
the
*NL*
street-door
,
to
be
as
near
living
people
as
he
could
;
and
would
remain
*NL*
there
,
listening
and
counting
the
hours
,
until
the
Jew
or
the
boys
*NL*
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
all
the
rooms
,
the
mouldering
shutters
were
fast
closed
:
the
bars
*NL*
which
held
them
were
screwed
tight
into
the
wood
;
the
only
light
which
*NL*
was
admitted
,
stealing
its
way
through
round
holes
at
the
top
:
which
*NL*
made
the
rooms
more
gloomy
,
and
filled
them
with
strange
shadows
.
*NL*
There
was
a
back-garret
window
with
rusty
bars
outside
,
which
had
no
*NL*
shutter
;
and
out
of
this
,
Oliver
often
gazed
with
a
melancholy
face
for
*NL*
hours
together
;
but
nothing
was
to
be
descried
from
it
but
a
confused
*NL*
and
crowded
mass
of
housetops
,
blackened
chimneys
,
and
gable-ends
.
*NL*
Sometimes
,
indeed
,
a
grizzly
head
might
be
seen
,
peering
over
the
*NL*
parapet-wall
of
a
distant
house
;
but
it
was
quickly
withdrawn
again
;
*NL*
and
as
the
window
of
Oliver
's
observatory
was
nailed
down
,
and
dimmed
*NL*
with
the
rain
and
smoke
of
years
,
it
was
as
much
as
he
could
do
to
make
*NL*
out
the
forms
of
the
different
objects
beyond
,
without
making
any
*NL*
attempt
to
be
seen
or
heard
,
--
which
he
had
as
much
chance
of
being
,
as
*NL*
if
he
had
lived
inside
the
ball
of
St.
Paul
's
Cathedral
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
afternoon
,
the
Dodger
and
Master
Bates
being
engaged
out
that
*NL*
evening
,
the
first-named
young
gentleman
took
it
into
his
head
to
*NL*
evince
some
anxiety
regarding
the
decoration
of
his
person
-LRB-
to
do
him
*NL*
justice
,
this
was
by
no
means
an
habitual
weakness
with
him
-RRB-
;
and
,
with
*NL*
this
end
and
aim
,
he
condescendingly
commanded
Oliver
to
assist
him
in
*NL*
his
toilet
,
straightway
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oliver
was
but
too
glad
to
make
himself
useful
;
too
happy
to
have
some
*NL*
faces
,
however
bad
,
to
look
upon
;
too
desirous
to
conciliate
those
*NL*
about
him
when
he
could
honestly
do
so
;
to
throw
any
objection
in
the
*NL*
way
of
this
proposal
.
So
he
at
once
expressed
his
readiness
;
and
,
*NL*
kneeling
on
the
floor
,
while
the
Dodger
sat
upon
the
table
so
that
he
*NL*
could
take
his
foot
in
his
laps
,
he
applied
himself
to
a
process
which
*NL*
Mr.
Dawkins
designated
as
`
japanning
his
trotter-cases
.
'
The
phrase
,
*NL*
rendered
into
plain
English
,
signifieth
,
cleaning
his
boots
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whether
it
was
the
sense
of
freedom
and
independence
which
a
rational
*NL*
animal
may
be
supposed
to
feel
when
he
sits
on
a
table
in
an
easy
*NL*
attitude
smoking
a
pipe
,
swinging
one
leg
carelessly
to
and
fro
,
and
*NL*
having
his
boots
cleaned
all
the
time
,
without
even
the
past
trouble
of
*NL*
having
taken
them
off
,
or
the
prospective
misery
of
putting
them
on
,
to
*NL*
disturb
his
reflections
;
or
whether
it
was
the
goodness
of
the
tobacco
*NL*
that
soothed
the
feelings
of
the
Dodger
,
or
the
mildness
of
the
beer
*NL*
that
mollified
his
thoughts
;
he
was
evidently
tinctured
,
for
the
nonce
,
*NL*
with
a
spice
of
romance
and
enthusiasm
,
foreign
to
his
general
nature
.
*NL*
He
looked
down
on
Oliver
,
with
a
thoughtful
countenance
,
for
a
brief
*NL*
space
;
and
then
,
raising
his
head
,
and
heaving
a
gentle
sign
,
said
,
*NL*
half
in
abstraction
,
and
half
to
Master
Bates
:
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
a
pity
it
is
he
is
n't
a
prig
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ah
!
'
said
Master
Charles
Bates
;
`
he
do
n't
know
what
's
good
for
him
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
Dodger
sighed
again
,
and
resumed
his
pipe
:
as
did
Charley
Bates
.
*NL*
They
both
smoked
,
for
some
seconds
,
in
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
suppose
you
do
n't
even
know
what
a
prig
is
?
'
said
the
Dodger
*NL*
mournfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
think
I
know
that
,
'
replied
Oliver
,
looking
up
.
`
It
's
a
the
--
;
*NL*
you
're
one
,
are
you
not
?
'
inquired
Oliver
,
checking
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
am
,
'
replied
the
Dodger
.
`
I
'd
scorn
to
be
anything
else
.
'
Mr.
*NL*
Dawkins
gave
his
hat
a
ferocious
cock
,
after
delivering
this
sentiment
,
*NL*
and
looked
at
Master
Bates
,
as
if
to
denote
that
he
would
feel
obliged
*NL*
by
his
saying
anything
to
the
contrary
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
am
,
'
repeated
the
Dodger
.
`
So
's
Charley
.
So
's
Fagin
.
So
's
Sikes
.
*NL*
So
's
Nancy
.
So
's
Bet
.
So
we
all
are
,
down
to
the
dog
.
And
he
's
the
*NL*
downiest
one
of
the
lot
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
the
least
given
to
peaching
,
'
added
Charley
Bates
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
would
n't
so
much
as
bark
in
a
witness-box
,
for
fear
of
committing
*NL*
himself
;
no
,
not
if
you
tied
him
up
in
one
,
and
left
him
there
without
*NL*
wittles
for
a
fortnight
,
'
said
the
Dodger
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Not
a
bit
of
it
,
'
observed
Charley
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
's
a
rum
dog
.
Do
n't
he
look
fierce
at
any
strange
cove
that
laughs
*NL*
or
sings
when
he
's
in
company
!
'
pursued
the
Dodger
.
`
Wo
n't
he
growl
at
*NL*
all
,
when
he
hears
a
fiddle
playing
!
And
do
n't
he
hate
other
dogs
as
*NL*
ai
n't
of
his
breed
!
Oh
,
no
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
's
an
out-and-out
Christian
,
'
said
Charley
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
merely
intended
as
a
tribute
to
the
animal
's
abilities
,
but
it
*NL*
was
an
appropriate
remark
in
another
sense
,
if
Master
Bates
had
only
*NL*
known
it
;
for
there
are
a
good
many
ladies
and
gentlemen
,
claiming
to
*NL*
be
out-and-out
Christians
,
between
whom
,
and
Mr.
Sikes
'
dog
,
there
*NL*
exist
strong
and
singular
points
of
resemblance
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
well
,
'
said
the
Dodger
,
recurring
to
the
point
from
which
they
*NL*
had
strayed
:
with
that
mindfulness
of
his
profession
which
influenced
*NL*
all
his
proceedings
.
`
This
has
n't
go
anything
to
do
with
young
Green
*NL*
here
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
more
it
has
,
'
said
Charley
.
`
Why
do
n't
you
put
yourself
under
*NL*
Fagin
,
Oliver
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
make
your
fortun
'
out
of
hand
?
'
added
the
Dodger
,
with
a
grin
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
so
be
able
to
retire
on
your
property
,
and
do
the
gen-teel
:
as
I
*NL*
mean
to
,
in
the
very
next
leap-year
but
four
that
ever
comes
,
and
the
*NL*
forty-second
Tuesday
in
Trinity-week
,
'
said
Charley
Bates
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
do
n't
like
it
,
'
rejoined
Oliver
,
timidly
;
'
I
wish
they
would
let
me
*NL*
go
.
I
--
I
--
would
rather
go
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
Fagin
would
RATHER
not
!
'
rejoined
Charley
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oliver
knew
this
too
well
;
but
thinking
it
might
be
dangerous
to
*NL*
express
his
feelings
more
openly
,
he
only
sighed
,
and
went
on
with
his
*NL*
boot-cleaning
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Go
!
'
exclaimed
the
Dodger
.
`
Why
,
where
's
your
spirit
?
'
Do
n't
you
take
*NL*
any
pride
out
of
yourself
?
Would
you
go
and
be
dependent
on
your
*NL*
friends
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
,
blow
that
!
'
said
Master
Bates
:
drawing
two
or
three
silk
*NL*
handkerchiefs
from
his
pocket
,
and
tossing
them
into
a
cupboard
,
*NL*
`
that
's
too
mean
;
that
is
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
_
I
_
could
n't
do
it
,
'
said
the
Dodger
,
with
an
air
of
haughty
disgust
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
can
leave
your
friends
,
though
,
'
said
Oliver
with
a
half
smile
;
*NL*
`
and
let
them
be
punished
for
what
you
did
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
,
'
rejoined
the
Dodger
,
with
a
wave
of
his
pipe
,
`
That
was
all
out
*NL*
of
consideration
for
Fagin
,
'cause
the
traps
know
that
we
work
*NL*
together
,
and
he
might
have
got
into
trouble
if
we
had
n't
made
our
*NL*
lucky
;
that
was
the
move
,
was
n't
it
,
Charley
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
Master
Bates
nodded
assent
,
and
would
have
spoken
,
but
the
recollection
*NL*
of
Oliver
's
flight
came
so
suddenly
upon
him
,
that
the
smoke
he
was
*NL*
inhaling
got
entangled
with
a
laugh
,
and
went
up
into
his
head
,
and
*NL*
down
into
his
throat
:
and
brought
on
a
fit
of
coughing
and
stamping
,
*NL*
about
five
minutes
long
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Look
here
!
'
said
the
Dodger
,
drawing
forth
a
handful
of
shillings
and
*NL*
halfpence
.
`
Here
's
a
jolly
life
!
What
's
the
odds
where
it
comes
from
?
*NL*
Here
,
catch
hold
;
there
's
plenty
more
where
they
were
took
from
.
You
*NL*
wo
n't
,
wo
n't
you
?
Oh
,
you
precious
flat
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
's
naughty
,
ai
n't
it
,
Oliver
?
'
inquired
Charley
Bates
.
`
He
'll
come
*NL*
to
be
scragged
,
wo
n't
he
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
do
n't
know
what
that
means
,
'
replied
Oliver
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Something
in
this
way
,
old
feller
,
'
said
Charly
.
As
he
said
it
,
*NL*
Master
Bates
caught
up
an
end
of
his
neckerchief
;
and
,
holding
it
erect
*NL*
in
the
air
,
dropped
his
head
on
his
shoulder
,
and
jerked
a
curious
*NL*
sound
through
his
teeth
;
thereby
indicating
,
by
a
lively
pantomimic
*NL*
representation
,
that
scragging
and
hanging
were
one
and
the
same
thing
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
's
what
it
means
,
'
said
Charley
.
`
Look
how
he
stares
,
Jack
!
*NL*
*NL*
I
never
did
see
such
prime
company
as
that
`
ere
boy
;
he
'll
be
the
death
*NL*
of
me
,
I
know
he
will
.
'
Master
Charley
Bates
,
having
laughed
heartily
*NL*
again
,
resumed
his
pipe
with
tears
in
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
've
been
brought
up
bad
,
'
said
the
Dodger
,
surveying
his
boots
with
*NL*
much
satisfaction
when
Oliver
had
polished
them
.
`
Fagin
will
make
*NL*
something
of
you
,
though
,
or
you
'll
be
the
first
he
ever
had
that
*NL*
turned
out
unprofitable
.
You
'd
better
begin
at
once
;
for
you
'll
come
*NL*
to
the
trade
long
before
you
think
of
it
;
and
you
're
only
losing
time
,
*NL*
Oliver
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Master
Bates
backed
this
advice
with
sundry
moral
admonitions
of
his
*NL*
own
:
which
,
being
exhausted
,
he
and
his
friend
Mr.
Dawkins
launched
*NL*
into
a
glowing
description
of
the
numerous
pleasures
incidental
to
the
*NL*
life
they
led
,
interspersed
with
a
variety
of
hints
to
Oliver
that
the
*NL*
best
thing
he
could
do
,
would
be
to
secure
Fagin
's
favour
without
more
*NL*
delay
,
by
the
means
which
they
themselves
had
employed
to
gain
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
always
put
this
in
your
pipe
,
Nolly
,
'
said
the
Dodger
,
as
the
Jew
*NL*
was
heard
unlocking
the
door
above
,
`
if
you
do
n't
take
fogels
and
*NL*
tickers
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
's
the
good
of
talking
in
that
way
?
'
interposed
Master
Bates
;
`
he
*NL*
do
n't
know
what
you
mean
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
If
you
do
n't
take
pocket-handkechers
and
watches
,
'
said
the
Dodger
,
*NL*
reducing
his
conversation
to
the
level
of
Oliver
's
capacity
,
`
some
*NL*
other
cove
will
;
so
that
the
coves
that
lose
'em
will
be
all
the
worse
,
*NL*
and
you
'll
be
all
the
worse
,
too
,
and
nobody
half
a
ha
`
p
`
orth
the
*NL*
better
,
except
the
chaps
wot
gets
them
--
and
you
've
just
as
good
a
right
*NL*
to
them
as
they
have
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
To
be
sure
,
to
be
sure
!
'
said
the
Jew
,
who
had
entered
unseen
by
*NL*
Oliver
.
`
It
all
lies
in
a
nutshell
my
dear
;
in
a
nutshell
,
take
the
*NL*
Dodger
's
word
for
it
.
Ha
!
ha
!
ha
!
He
understands
the
catechism
of
his
*NL*
trade
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
man
rubbed
his
hands
gleefully
together
,
as
he
corroborated
the
*NL*
Dodger
's
reasoning
in
these
terms
;
and
chuckled
with
delight
at
his
*NL*
pupil
's
proficiency
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
conversation
proceeded
no
farther
at
this
time
,
for
the
Jew
had
*NL*
returned
home
accompanied
by
Miss
Betsy
,
and
a
gentleman
whom
Oliver
*NL*
had
never
seen
before
,
but
who
was
accosted
by
the
Dodger
as
Tom
*NL*
Chitling
;
and
who
,
having
lingered
on
the
stairs
to
exchange
a
few
*NL*
gallantries
with
the
lady
,
now
made
his
appearance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Chitling
was
older
in
years
than
the
Dodger
:
having
perhaps
*NL*
numbered
eighteen
winters
;
but
there
was
a
degree
of
deference
in
his
*NL*
deportment
towards
that
young
gentleman
which
seemed
to
indicate
that
*NL*
he
felt
himself
conscious
of
a
slight
inferiority
in
point
of
genius
*NL*
and
professional
aquirements
.
He
had
small
twinkling
eyes
,
and
a
*NL*
pock-marked
face
;
wore
a
fur
cap
,
a
dark
corduroy
jacket
,
greasy
*NL*
fustian
trousers
,
and
an
apron
.
His
wardrobe
was
,
in
truth
,
rather
out
*NL*
of
repair
;
but
he
excused
himself
to
the
company
by
stating
that
his
*NL*
`
time
'
was
only
out
an
hour
before
;
and
that
,
in
consequence
of
having
*NL*
worn
the
regimentals
for
six
weeks
past
,
he
had
not
been
able
to
bestow
*NL*
any
attention
on
his
private
clothes
.
Mr.
Chitling
added
,
with
strong
*NL*
marks
of
irritation
,
that
the
new
way
of
fumigating
clothes
up
yonder
*NL*
was
infernal
unconstitutional
,
for
it
burnt
holes
in
them
,
and
there
*NL*
was
no
remedy
against
the
County
.
The
same
remark
he
considered
to
*NL*
apply
to
the
regulation
mode
of
cutting
the
hair
:
which
he
held
to
be
*NL*
decidedly
unlawful
.
Mr.
Chitling
wound
up
his
observations
by
stating
*NL*
that
he
had
not
touched
a
drop
of
anything
for
forty-two
moral
long
*NL*
hard-working
days
;
and
that
he
`
wished
he
might
be
busted
if
he
war
n't
*NL*
as
dry
as
a
lime-basket
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Where
do
you
think
the
gentleman
has
come
from
,
Oliver
?
'
inquired
the
*NL*
Jew
,
with
a
grin
,
as
the
other
boys
put
a
bottle
of
spirits
on
the
*NL*
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
--
I
--
do
n't
know
,
sir
,
'
replied
Oliver
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Who
's
that
?
'
inquired
Tom
Chitling
,
casting
a
contemptuous
look
at
*NL*
Oliver
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
A
young
friend
of
mine
,
my
dear
,
'
replied
the
Jew
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
's
in
luck
,
then
,
'
said
the
young
man
,
with
a
meaning
look
at
Fagin
.
*NL*
`
Never
mind
where
I
came
from
,
young
`
un
;
you
'll
find
your
way
there
,
*NL*
soon
enough
,
I
'll
bet
a
crown
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
sally
,
the
boys
laughed
.
After
some
more
jokes
on
the
same
*NL*
subject
,
they
exchanged
a
few
short
whispers
with
Fagin
;
and
withdrew
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
some
words
apart
between
the
last
comer
and
Fagin
,
they
drew
*NL*
their
chairs
towards
the
fire
;
and
the
Jew
,
telling
Oliver
to
come
and
*NL*
sit
by
him
,
led
the
conversation
to
the
topics
most
calculated
to
*NL*
interest
his
hearers
.
These
were
,
the
great
advantages
of
the
trade
,
*NL*
the
proficiency
of
the
Dodger
,
the
amiability
of
Charley
Bates
,
and
the
*NL*
liberality
of
the
Jew
himself
.
At
length
these
subjects
displayed
*NL*
signs
of
being
thoroughly
exhausted
;
and
Mr.
Chitling
did
the
same
:
*NL*
for
the
house
of
correction
becomes
fatiguing
after
a
week
or
two
.
*NL*
Miss
Betsy
accordingly
withdrew
;
and
left
the
party
to
their
repose
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
this
day
,
Oliver
was
seldom
left
alone
;
but
was
placed
in
almost
*NL*
constant
communication
with
the
two
boys
,
who
played
the
old
game
with
*NL*
the
Jew
every
day
:
whether
for
their
own
improvement
or
Oliver
's
,
Mr.
*NL*
Fagin
best
knew
.
At
other
times
the
old
man
would
tell
them
stories
of
*NL*
robberies
he
had
committed
in
his
younger
days
:
mixed
up
with
so
much
*NL*
that
was
droll
and
curious
,
that
Oliver
could
not
help
laughing
*NL*
heartily
,
and
showing
that
he
was
amused
in
spite
of
all
his
better
*NL*
feelings
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
short
,
the
wily
old
Jew
had
the
boy
in
his
toils
.
Having
prepared
*NL*
his
mind
,
by
solitude
and
gloom
,
to
prefer
any
society
to
the
*NL*
companionship
of
his
own
sad
thoughts
in
such
a
dreary
place
,
he
was
*NL*
now
slowly
instilling
into
his
soul
the
poison
which
he
hoped
would
*NL*
blacken
it
,
and
change
its
hue
for
ever
.

CHAPTER
XIX
*NL*
*NL*
IN
WHICH
A
NOTABLE
PLAN
IS
DISCUSSED
AND
DETERMINED
ON
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
chill
,
damp
,
windy
night
,
when
the
Jew
:
buttoning
his
*NL*
great-coat
tight
round
his
shrivelled
body
,
and
pulling
the
collar
up
*NL*
over
his
ears
so
as
completely
to
obscure
the
lower
part
of
his
face
:
*NL*
emerged
from
his
den
.
He
paused
on
the
step
as
the
door
was
locked
and
*NL*
chained
behind
him
;
and
having
listened
while
the
boys
made
all
secure
,
*NL*
and
until
their
retreating
footsteps
were
no
longer
audible
,
slunk
down
*NL*
the
street
as
quickly
as
he
could
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
house
to
which
Oliver
had
been
conveyed
,
was
in
the
neighborhood
of
*NL*
Whitechapel
.
The
Jew
stopped
for
an
instant
at
the
corner
of
the
*NL*
street
;
and
,
glancing
suspiciously
round
,
crossed
the
road
,
and
struck
*NL*
off
in
the
direction
of
the
Spitalfields
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
mud
lay
thick
upon
the
stones
,
and
a
black
mist
hung
over
the
*NL*
streets
;
the
rain
fell
sluggishly
down
,
and
everything
felt
cold
and
*NL*
clammy
to
the
touch
.
It
seemed
just
the
night
when
it
befitted
such
a
*NL*
being
as
the
Jew
to
be
abroad
.
As
he
glided
stealthily
along
,
creeping
*NL*
beneath
the
shelter
of
the
walls
and
doorways
,
the
hideous
old
man
*NL*
seemed
like
some
loathsome
reptile
,
engendered
in
the
slime
and
*NL*
darkness
through
which
he
moved
:
crawling
forth
,
by
night
,
in
search
of
*NL*
some
rich
offal
for
a
meal
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
kept
on
his
course
,
through
many
winding
and
narrow
ways
,
until
he
*NL*
reached
Bethnal
Green
;
then
,
turning
suddenly
off
to
the
left
,
he
soon
*NL*
became
involved
in
a
maze
of
the
mean
and
dirty
streets
which
abound
in
*NL*
that
close
and
densely-populated
quarter
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Jew
was
evidently
too
familiar
with
the
ground
he
traversed
to
be
*NL*
at
all
bewildered
,
either
by
the
darkness
of
the
night
,
or
the
*NL*
intricacies
of
the
way
.
He
hurried
through
several
alleys
and
streets
,
*NL*
and
at
length
turned
into
one
,
lighted
only
by
a
single
lamp
at
the
*NL*
farther
end
.
At
the
door
of
a
house
in
this
street
,
he
knocked
;
having
*NL*
exchanged
a
few
muttered
words
with
the
person
who
opened
it
,
he
walked
*NL*
upstairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
dog
growled
as
he
touched
the
handle
of
a
room-door
;
and
a
man
's
*NL*
voice
demanded
who
was
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Only
me
,
Bill
;
only
me
,
my
dear
,
'
said
the
Jew
looking
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Bring
in
your
body
then
,
'
said
Sikes
.
`
Lie
down
,
you
stupid
brute
!
*NL*
Do
n't
you
know
the
devil
when
he
's
got
a
great-coat
on
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
Apparently
,
the
dog
had
been
somewhat
deceived
by
Mr.
Fagin
's
outer
*NL*
garment
;
for
as
the
Jew
unbuttoned
it
,
and
threw
it
over
the
back
of
a
*NL*
chair
,
he
retired
to
the
corner
from
which
he
had
risen
:
wagging
his
*NL*
tail
as
he
went
,
to
show
that
he
was
as
well
satisfied
as
it
was
in
his
*NL*
nature
to
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
!
'
said
Sikes
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
my
dear
,
'
replied
the
Jew
.
--
`
Ah
!
Nancy
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
latter
recognition
was
uttered
with
just
enough
of
embarrassment
to
*NL*
imply
a
doubt
of
its
reception
;
for
Mr.
Fagin
and
his
young
friend
had
*NL*
not
met
,
since
she
had
interfered
in
behalf
of
Oliver
.
All
doubts
upon
*NL*
the
subject
,
if
he
had
any
,
were
speedily
removed
by
the
young
lady
's
*NL*
behaviour
.
She
took
her
feet
off
the
fender
,
pushed
back
her
chair
,
*NL*
and
bade
Fagin
draw
up
his
,
without
saying
more
about
it
:
for
it
was
a
*NL*
cold
night
,
and
no
mistake
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
is
cold
,
Nancy
dear
,
'
said
the
Jew
,
as
he
warmed
his
skinny
hands
*NL*
over
the
fire
.
`
It
seems
to
go
right
through
one
,
'
added
the
old
man
,
*NL*
touching
his
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
must
be
a
piercer
,
if
it
finds
its
way
through
your
heart
,
'
said
*NL*
Mr.
Sikes
.
`
Give
him
something
to
drink
,
Nancy
.
Burn
my
body
,
make
*NL*
haste
!
It
's
enough
to
turn
a
man
ill
,
to
see
his
lean
old
carcase
*NL*
shivering
in
that
way
,
like
a
ugly
ghost
just
rose
from
the
grave
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Nancy
quickly
brought
a
bottle
from
a
cupboard
,
in
which
there
were
*NL*
many
:
which
,
to
judge
from
the
diversity
of
their
appearance
,
were
*NL*
filled
with
several
kinds
of
liquids
.
Sikes
pouring
out
a
glass
of
*NL*
brandy
,
bade
the
Jew
drink
it
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Quite
enough
,
quite
,
thankye
,
Bill
,
'
replied
the
Jew
,
putting
down
the
*NL*
glass
after
just
setting
his
lips
to
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
!
You
're
afraid
of
our
getting
the
better
of
you
,
are
you
?
'
*NL*
inquired
Sikes
,
fixing
his
eyes
on
the
Jew
.
`
Ugh
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
With
a
hoarse
grunt
of
contempt
,
Mr.
Sikes
seized
the
glass
,
and
threw
*NL*
the
remainder
of
its
contents
into
the
ashes
:
as
a
preparatory
ceremony
*NL*
to
filling
it
again
for
himself
:
which
he
did
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Jew
glanced
round
the
room
,
as
his
companion
tossed
down
the
second
*NL*
glassful
;
not
in
curiousity
,
for
he
had
seen
it
often
before
;
but
in
a
*NL*
restless
and
suspicious
manner
habitual
to
him
.
It
was
a
meanly
*NL*
furnished
apartment
,
with
nothing
but
the
contents
of
the
closet
to
*NL*
induce
the
belief
that
its
occupier
was
anything
but
a
working
man
;
and
*NL*
with
no
more
suspicious
articles
displayed
to
view
than
two
or
three
*NL*
heavy
bludgeons
which
stood
in
a
corner
,
and
a
`
life-preserver
'
that
*NL*
hung
over
the
chimney-piece
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
There
,
'
said
Sikes
,
smacking
his
lips
.
`
Now
I
'm
ready
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
For
business
?
'
inquired
the
Jew
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
For
business
,
'
replied
Sikes
;
`
so
say
what
you
've
got
to
say
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
About
the
crib
at
Chertsey
,
Bill
?
'
said
the
Jew
,
drawing
his
chair
*NL*
forward
,
and
speaking
in
a
very
low
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
.
Wot
about
it
?
'
inquired
Sikes
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ah
!
you
know
what
I
mean
,
my
dear
,
'
said
the
Jew
.
`
He
knows
what
I
*NL*
mean
,
Nancy
;
do
n't
he
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
he
do
n't
,
'
sneered
Mr.
Sikes
.
`
Or
he
wo
n't
,
and
that
's
the
same
*NL*
thing
.
Speak
out
,
and
call
things
by
their
right
names
;
do
n't
sit
*NL*
there
,
winking
and
blinking
,
and
talking
to
me
in
hints
,
as
if
you
*NL*
war
n't
the
very
first
that
thought
about
the
robbery
.
Wot
d'ye
mean
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Hush
,
Bill
,
hush
!
'
said
the
Jew
,
who
had
in
vain
attempted
to
stop
*NL*
this
burst
of
indignation
;
`
somebody
will
hear
us
,
my
dear
.
Somebody
*NL*
will
hear
us
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Let
'em
hear
!
'
said
Sikes
;
'
I
do
n't
care
.
'
But
as
Mr.
Sikes
DID
care
,
*NL*
on
reflection
,
he
dropped
his
voice
as
he
said
the
words
,
and
grew
*NL*
calmer
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
There
,
there
,
'
said
the
Jew
,
coaxingly
.
`
It
was
only
my
caution
,
*NL*
nothing
more
.
Now
,
my
dear
,
about
that
crib
at
Chertsey
;
when
is
it
to
*NL*
be
done
,
Bill
,
eh
?
When
is
it
to
be
done
?
Such
plate
,
my
dear
,
such
*NL*
plate
!
'
said
the
Jew
:
rubbing
his
hands
,
and
elevating
his
eyebrows
in
*NL*
a
rapture
of
anticipation
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Not
at
all
,
'
replied
Sikes
coldly
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Not
to
be
done
at
all
!
'
echoed
the
Jew
,
leaning
back
in
his
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
not
at
all
,
'
rejoined
Sikes
.
`
At
least
it
ca
n't
be
a
put-up
job
,
*NL*
as
we
expected
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Then
it
has
n't
been
properly
gone
about
,
'
said
the
Jew
,
turning
pale
*NL*
with
anger
.
`
Do
n't
tell
me
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
I
will
tell
you
,
'
retorted
Sikes
.
`
Who
are
you
that
's
not
to
be
*NL*
told
?
I
tell
you
that
Toby
Crackit
has
been
hanging
about
the
place
*NL*
for
a
fortnight
,
and
he
ca
n't
get
one
of
the
servants
in
line
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Do
you
mean
to
tell
me
,
Bill
,
'
said
the
Jew
:
softening
as
the
other
*NL*
grew
heated
:
`
that
neither
of
the
two
men
in
the
house
can
be
got
*NL*
over
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
I
do
mean
to
tell
you
so
,
'
replied
Sikes
.
`
The
old
lady
has
had
*NL*
'em
these
twenty
years
;
and
if
you
were
to
give
'em
five
hundred
pound
,
*NL*
they
would
n't
be
in
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
do
you
mean
to
say
,
my
dear
,
'
remonstrated
the
Jew
,
`
that
the
*NL*
women
ca
n't
be
got
over
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Not
a
bit
of
it
,
'
replied
Sikes
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Not
by
flash
Toby
Crackit
?
'
said
the
Jew
incredulously
.
`
Think
what
*NL*
women
are
,
Bill
,
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
;
not
even
by
flash
Toby
Crackit
,
'
replied
Sikes
.
`
He
says
he
's
*NL*
worn
sham
whiskers
,
and
a
canary
waistcoat
,
the
whole
blessed
time
he
's
*NL*
been
loitering
down
there
,
and
it
's
all
of
no
use
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
should
have
tried
mustachios
and
a
pair
of
military
trousers
,
my
*NL*
dear
,
'
said
the
Jew
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
So
he
did
,
'
rejoined
Sikes
,
`
and
they
war
n't
of
no
more
use
than
the
*NL*
other
plant
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
Jew
looked
blank
at
this
information
.
After
ruminating
for
some
*NL*
minutes
with
his
chin
sunk
on
his
breast
,
he
raised
his
head
and
said
,
*NL*
with
a
deep
sigh
,
that
if
flash
Toby
Crackit
reported
aright
,
he
feared
*NL*
the
game
was
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
yet
,
'
said
the
old
man
,
dropping
his
hands
on
his
knees
,
`
it
's
a
*NL*
sad
thing
,
my
dear
,
to
lose
so
much
when
we
had
set
our
hearts
upon
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
So
it
is
,
'
said
Mr.
Sikes
.
`
Worse
luck
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
A
long
silence
ensued
;
during
which
the
Jew
was
plunged
in
deep
*NL*
thought
,
with
his
face
wrinkled
into
an
expression
of
villainy
*NL*
perfectly
demoniacal
.
Sikes
eyed
him
furtively
from
time
to
time
.
*NL*
Nancy
,
apparently
fearful
of
irritating
the
housebreaker
,
sat
with
her
*NL*
eyes
fixed
upon
the
fire
,
as
if
she
had
been
deaf
to
all
that
passed
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Fagin
,
'
said
Sikes
,
abruptly
breaking
the
stillness
that
prevailed
;
*NL*
`
is
it
worth
fifty
shiners
extra
,
if
it
's
safely
done
from
the
outside
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
'
said
the
Jew
,
as
suddenly
rousing
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Is
it
a
bargain
?
'
inquired
Sikes
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
my
dear
,
yes
,
'
rejoined
the
Jew
;
his
eyes
glistening
,
and
every
*NL*
muscle
in
his
face
working
,
with
the
excitement
that
the
inquiry
had
*NL*
awakened
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Then
,
'
said
Sikes
,
thrusting
aside
the
Jew
's
hand
,
with
some
disdain
,
*NL*
`
let
it
come
off
as
soon
as
you
like
.
Toby
and
me
were
over
the
*NL*
garden-wall
the
night
afore
last
,
sounding
the
panels
of
the
door
and
*NL*
shutters
.
The
crib
's
barred
up
at
night
like
a
jail
;
but
there
's
one
*NL*
part
we
can
crack
,
safe
and
softly
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Which
is
that
,
Bill
?
'
asked
the
Jew
eagerly
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
'
whispered
Sikes
,
`
as
you
cross
the
lawn
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
?
'
said
the
Jew
,
bending
his
head
forward
,
with
his
eyes
almost
*NL*
starting
out
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Umph
!
'
cried
Sikes
,
stopping
short
,
as
the
girl
,
scarcely
moving
her
*NL*
head
,
looked
suddenly
round
,
and
pointed
for
an
instant
to
the
Jew
's
*NL*
face
.
`
Never
mind
which
part
it
is
.
You
ca
n't
do
it
without
me
,
I
*NL*
know
;
but
it
's
best
to
be
on
the
safe
side
when
one
deals
with
you
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
As
you
like
,
my
dear
,
as
you
like
'
replied
the
Jew
.
`
Is
there
no
help
*NL*
wanted
,
but
yours
and
Toby
's
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
None
,
'
said
Sikes
.
`
Cept
a
centre-bit
and
a
boy
.
The
first
we
've
*NL*
both
got
;
the
second
you
must
find
us
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
A
boy
!
'
exclaimed
the
Jew
.
`
Oh
!
then
it
's
a
panel
,
eh
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Never
mind
wot
it
is
!
'
replied
Sikes
.
'
I
want
a
boy
,
and
he
mus
n't
be
*NL*
a
big
`
un
.
Lord
!
'
said
Mr.
Sikes
,
reflectively
,
`
if
I
'd
only
got
that
*NL*
young
boy
of
Ned
,
the
chimbley-sweeper
's
!
He
kept
him
small
on
*NL*
purpose
,
and
let
him
out
by
the
job
.
But
the
father
gets
lagged
;
and
*NL*
then
the
Juvenile
Delinquent
Society
comes
,
and
takes
the
boy
away
from
*NL*
a
trade
where
he
was
earning
money
,
teaches
him
to
read
and
write
,
and
*NL*
in
time
makes
a
`
prentice
of
him
.
And
so
they
go
on
,
'
said
Mr.
Sikes
,
*NL*
his
wrath
rising
with
the
recollection
of
his
wrongs
,
`
so
they
go
on
;
*NL*
and
,
if
they
'd
got
money
enough
-LRB-
which
it
's
a
Providence
they
have
n't
,
-RRB-
*NL*
we
should
n't
have
half
a
dozen
boys
left
in
the
whole
trade
,
in
a
year
*NL*
or
two
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
more
we
should
,
'
acquiesced
the
Jew
,
who
had
been
considering
*NL*
during
this
speech
,
and
had
only
caught
the
last
sentence
.
`
Bill
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
now
?
'
inquired
Sikes
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Jew
nodded
his
head
towards
Nancy
,
who
was
still
gazing
at
the
*NL*
fire
;
and
intimated
,
by
a
sign
,
that
he
would
have
her
told
to
leave
*NL*
the
room
.
Sikes
shrugged
his
shoulders
impatiently
,
as
if
he
thought
*NL*
the
precaution
unnecessary
;
but
complied
,
nevertheless
,
by
requesting
*NL*
Miss
Nancy
to
fetch
him
a
jug
of
beer
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
do
n't
want
any
beer
,
'
said
Nancy
,
folding
her
arms
,
and
retaining
*NL*
her
seat
very
composedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
tell
you
I
do
!
'
replied
Sikes
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Nonsense
,
'
rejoined
the
girl
coolly
,
`
Go
on
,
Fagin
.
I
know
what
he
's
*NL*
going
to
say
,
Bill
;
he
need
n't
mind
me
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
Jew
still
hesitated
.
Sikes
looked
from
one
to
the
other
in
some
*NL*
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
you
do
n't
mind
the
old
girl
,
do
you
,
Fagin
?
'
he
asked
at
length
.
*NL*
`
You
've
known
her
long
enough
to
trust
her
,
or
the
Devil
's
in
it
.
She
*NL*
ai
n't
one
to
blab
.
Are
you
Nancy
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
_
I
_
should
think
not
!
'
replied
the
young
lady
:
drawing
her
chair
up
*NL*
to
the
table
,
and
putting
her
elbows
upon
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
no
,
my
dear
,
I
know
you
're
not
,
'
said
the
Jew
;
`
but
--
'
and
again
*NL*
the
old
man
paused
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
wot
?
'
inquired
Sikes
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
did
n't
know
whether
she
might
n't
p
`
r
`
aps
be
out
of
sorts
,
you
know
,
*NL*
my
dear
,
as
she
was
the
other
night
,
'
replied
the
Jew
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
confession
,
Miss
Nancy
burst
into
a
loud
laugh
;
and
,
swallowing
*NL*
a
glass
of
brandy
,
shook
her
head
with
an
air
of
defiance
,
and
burst
*NL*
into
sundry
exclamations
of
`
Keep
the
game
a-going
!
'
`
Never
say
die
!
'
*NL*
and
the
like
.
These
seemed
to
have
the
effect
of
re-assuring
both
*NL*
gentlemen
;
for
the
Jew
nodded
his
head
with
a
satisfied
air
,
and
*NL*
resumed
his
seat
:
as
did
Mr.
Sikes
likewise
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Now
,
Fagin
,
'
said
Nancy
with
a
laugh
.
`
Tell
Bill
at
once
,
about
*NL*
Oliver
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ha
!
you
're
a
clever
one
,
my
dear
:
the
sharpest
girl
I
ever
saw
!
'
said
*NL*
the
Jew
,
patting
her
on
the
neck
.
`
It
WAS
about
Oliver
I
was
going
to
*NL*
speak
,
sure
enough
.
Ha
!
ha
!
ha
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
about
him
?
'
demanded
Sikes
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
's
the
boy
for
you
,
my
dear
,
'
replied
the
Jew
in
a
hoarse
whisper
;
*NL*
laying
his
finger
on
the
side
of
his
nose
,
and
grinning
frightfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
!
'
exclaimed
.
Sikes
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Have
him
,
Bill
!
'
said
Nancy
.
'
I
would
,
if
I
was
in
your
place
.
He
*NL*
may
n't
be
so
much
up
,
as
any
of
the
others
;
but
that
's
not
what
you
*NL*
want
,
if
he
's
only
to
open
a
door
for
you
.
Depend
upon
it
he
's
a
safe
*NL*
one
,
Bill
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
know
he
is
,
'
rejoined
Fagin
.
`
He
's
been
in
good
training
these
last
*NL*
few
weeks
,
and
it
's
time
he
began
to
work
for
his
bread
.
Besides
,
the
*NL*
others
are
all
too
big
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
he
is
just
the
size
I
want
,
'
said
Mr.
Sikes
,
ruminating
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
will
do
everything
you
want
,
Bill
,
my
dear
,
'
interposed
the
Jew
;
*NL*
`
he
ca
n't
help
himself
.
That
is
,
if
you
frighten
him
enough
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Frighten
him
!
'
echoed
Sikes
.
`
It
'll
be
no
sham
frightening
,
mind
you
.
*NL*
If
there
's
anything
queer
about
him
when
we
once
get
into
the
work
;
in
*NL*
for
a
penny
,
in
for
a
pound
.
You
wo
n't
see
him
alive
again
,
Fagin
.
*NL*
Think
of
that
,
before
you
send
him
.
Mark
my
words
!
'
said
the
robber
,
*NL*
poising
a
crowbar
,
which
he
had
drawn
from
under
the
bedstead
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
've
thought
of
it
all
,
'
said
the
Jew
with
energy
.
`
I
've
--
I
've
had
my
*NL*
eye
upon
him
,
my
dears
,
close
--
close
.
Once
let
him
feel
that
he
is
one
*NL*
of
us
;
once
fill
his
mind
with
the
idea
that
he
has
been
a
thief
;
and
*NL*
he
's
ours
!
Ours
for
his
life
.
Oho
!
It
could
n't
have
come
about
*NL*
better
!
The
old
man
crossed
his
arms
upon
his
breast
;
and
,
drawing
his
*NL*
head
and
shoulders
into
a
heap
,
literally
hugged
himself
for
joy
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ours
!
'
said
Sikes
.
`
Yours
,
you
mean
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Perhaps
I
do
,
my
dear
,
'
said
the
Jew
,
with
a
shrill
chuckle
.
`
Mine
,
if
*NL*
you
like
,
Bill
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
wot
,
'
said
Sikes
,
scowling
fiercely
on
his
agreeable
friend
,
`
wot
*NL*
makes
you
take
so
much
pains
about
one
chalk-faced
kid
,
when
you
know
*NL*
there
are
fifty
boys
snoozing
about
Common
Garden
every
night
,
as
you
*NL*
might
pick
and
choose
from
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Because
they
're
of
no
use
to
me
,
my
dear
,
'
replied
the
Jew
,
with
some
*NL*
confusion
,
`
not
worth
the
taking
.
Their
looks
convict
'em
when
they
*NL*
get
into
trouble
,
and
I
lose
'em
all
.
With
this
boy
,
properly
managed
,
*NL*
my
dears
,
I
could
do
what
I
could
n't
with
twenty
of
them
.
Besides
,
'
*NL*
said
the
Jew
,
recovering
his
self-possession
,
`
he
has
us
now
if
he
*NL*
could
only
give
us
leg-bail
again
;
and
he
must
be
in
the
same
boat
with
*NL*
us
.
Never
mind
how
he
came
there
;
it
's
quite
enough
for
my
power
over
*NL*
him
that
he
was
in
a
robbery
;
that
's
all
I
want
.
Now
,
how
much
better
*NL*
this
is
,
than
being
obliged
to
put
the
poor
leetle
boy
out
of
the
*NL*
way
--
which
would
be
dangerous
,
and
we
should
lose
by
it
besides
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
When
is
it
to
be
done
?
'
asked
Nancy
,
stopping
some
turbulent
*NL*
exclamation
on
the
part
of
Mr.
Sikes
,
expressive
of
the
disgust
with
*NL*
which
he
received
Fagin
's
affectation
of
humanity
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ah
,
to
be
sure
,
'
said
the
Jew
;
`
when
is
it
to
be
done
,
Bill
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
planned
with
Toby
,
the
night
arter
to-morrow
,
'
rejoined
Sikes
in
a
*NL*
surly
voice
,
`
if
he
heerd
nothing
from
me
to
the
contrairy
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Good
,
'
said
the
Jew
;
`
there
's
no
moon
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
'
rejoined
Sikes
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
's
all
arranged
about
bringing
off
the
swag
,
is
it
?
'
asked
the
Jew
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sikes
nodded
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
about
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
,
ah
,
it
's
all
planned
,
'
rejoined
Sikes
,
interrupting
him
.
`
Never
*NL*
mind
particulars
.
You
'd
better
bring
the
boy
here
to-morrow
night
.
I
*NL*
shall
get
off
the
stone
an
hour
arter
daybreak
.
Then
you
hold
your
*NL*
tongue
,
and
keep
the
melting-pot
ready
,
and
that
's
all
you
'll
have
to
*NL*
do
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
After
some
discussion
,
in
which
all
three
took
an
active
part
,
it
was
*NL*
decided
that
Nancy
should
repair
to
the
Jew
's
next
evening
when
the
*NL*
night
had
set
in
,
and
bring
Oliver
away
with
her
;
Fagin
craftily
*NL*
observing
,
that
,
if
he
evinced
any
disinclination
to
the
task
,
he
would
*NL*
be
more
willing
to
accompany
the
girl
who
had
so
recently
interfered
in
*NL*
his
behalf
,
than
anybody
else
.
It
was
also
solemnly
arranged
that
poor
*NL*
Oliver
should
,
for
the
purposes
of
the
contemplated
expedition
,
be
*NL*
unreservedly
consigned
to
the
care
and
custody
of
Mr.
William
Sikes
;
*NL*
and
further
,
that
the
said
Sikes
should
deal
with
him
as
he
thought
*NL*
fit
;
and
should
not
be
held
responsible
by
the
Jew
for
any
mischance
or
*NL*
evil
that
might
be
necessary
to
visit
him
:
it
being
understood
that
,
to
*NL*
render
the
compact
in
this
respect
binding
,
any
representations
made
by
*NL*
Mr.
Sikes
on
his
return
should
be
required
to
be
confirmed
and
*NL*
corroborated
,
in
all
important
particulars
,
by
the
testimony
of
flash
*NL*
Toby
Crackit
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
preliminaries
adjusted
,
Mr.
Sikes
proceeded
to
drink
brandy
at
a
*NL*
furious
rate
,
and
to
flourish
the
crowbar
in
an
alarming
manner
;
*NL*
yelling
forth
,
at
the
same
time
,
most
unmusical
snatches
of
song
,
*NL*
mingled
with
wild
execrations
.
At
length
,
in
a
fit
of
professional
*NL*
enthusiasm
,
he
insisted
upon
producing
his
box
of
housebreaking
tools
:
*NL*
which
he
had
no
sooner
stumbled
in
with
,
and
opened
for
the
purpose
of
*NL*
explaining
the
nature
and
properties
of
the
various
implements
it
*NL*
contained
,
and
the
peculiar
beauties
of
their
construction
,
than
he
*NL*
fell
over
the
box
upon
the
floor
,
and
went
to
sleep
where
he
fell
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Good-night
,
Nancy
,
'
said
the
Jew
,
muffling
himself
up
as
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Good-night
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Their
eyes
met
,
and
the
Jew
scrutinised
her
,
narrowly
.
There
was
no
*NL*
flinching
about
the
girl
.
She
was
as
true
and
earnest
in
the
matter
as
*NL*
Toby
Crackit
himself
could
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Jew
again
bade
her
good-night
,
and
,
bestowing
a
sly
kick
upon
the
*NL*
prostrate
form
of
Mr.
Sikes
while
her
back
was
turned
,
groped
*NL*
downstairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Always
the
way
!
'
muttered
the
Jew
to
himself
as
he
turned
homeward
.
*NL*
`
The
worst
of
these
women
is
,
that
a
very
little
thing
serves
to
call
*NL*
up
some
long-forgotten
feeling
;
and
,
the
best
of
them
is
,
that
it
never
*NL*
lasts
.
Ha
!
ha
!
The
man
against
the
child
,
for
a
bag
of
gold
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Beguiling
the
time
with
these
pleasant
reflections
,
Mr.
Fagin
wended
*NL*
his
way
,
through
mud
and
mire
,
to
his
gloomy
abode
:
where
the
Dodger
*NL*
was
sitting
up
,
impatiently
awaiting
his
return
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Is
Oliver
a-bed
?
I
want
to
speak
to
him
,
'
was
his
first
remark
as
*NL*
they
descended
the
stairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Hours
ago
,
'
replied
the
Dodger
,
throwing
open
a
door
.
`
Here
he
is
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
boy
was
lying
,
fast
asleep
,
on
a
rude
bed
upon
the
floor
;
so
pale
*NL*
with
anxiety
,
and
sadness
,
and
the
closeness
of
his
prison
,
that
he
*NL*
looked
like
death
;
not
death
as
it
shows
in
shroud
and
coffin
,
but
in
*NL*
the
guise
it
wears
when
life
has
just
departed
;
when
a
young
and
gentle
*NL*
spirit
has
,
but
an
instant
,
fled
to
Heaven
,
and
the
gross
air
of
the
*NL*
world
has
not
had
time
to
breathe
upon
the
changing
dust
it
hallowed
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Not
now
,
'
said
the
Jew
,
turning
softly
away
.

To-morrow

To-morrow

CHAPTER
XX
*NL*
*NL*
WHEREIN
OLIVER
IS
DELIVERED
OVER
TO
MR.
WILLIAM
SIKES
*NL*
*NL*
When
Oliver
awoke
in
the
morning
,
he
was
a
good
deal
surprised
to
find
*NL*
that
a
new
pair
of
shoes
,
with
strong
thick
soles
,
had
been
placed
at
*NL*
his
bedside
;
and
that
his
old
shoes
had
been
removed
.
At
first
,
he
was
*NL*
pleased
with
the
discovery
:
hoping
that
it
might
be
the
forerunner
of
*NL*
his
release
;
but
such
thoughts
were
quickly
dispelled
,
on
his
sitting
*NL*
down
to
breakfast
along
with
the
Jew
,
who
told
him
,
in
a
tone
and
*NL*
manner
which
increased
his
alarm
,
that
he
was
to
be
taken
to
the
*NL*
residence
of
Bill
Sikes
that
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
To
--
to
--
stop
there
,
sir
?
'
asked
Oliver
,
anxiously
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
no
,
my
dear
.
Not
to
stop
there
,
'
replied
the
Jew
.
`
We
should
n't
*NL*
like
to
lose
you
.
Do
n't
be
afraid
,
Oliver
,
you
shall
come
back
to
us
*NL*
again
.
Ha
!
ha
!
ha
!
We
wo
n't
be
so
cruel
as
to
send
you
away
,
my
dear
.
*NL*
Oh
no
,
no
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
man
,
who
was
stooping
over
the
fire
toasting
a
piece
of
bread
,
*NL*
looked
round
as
he
bantered
Oliver
thus
;
and
chuckled
as
if
to
show
*NL*
that
he
knew
he
would
still
be
very
glad
to
get
away
if
he
could
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
suppose
,
'
said
the
Jew
,
fixing
his
eyes
on
Oliver
,
`
you
want
to
know
*NL*
what
you
're
going
to
Bill
's
for
--
eh
,
my
dear
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
Oliver
coloured
,
involuntarily
,
to
find
that
the
old
thief
had
been
*NL*
reading
his
thoughts
;
but
boldly
said
,
Yes
,
he
did
want
to
know
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
do
you
think
?
'
inquired
Fagin
,
parrying
the
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Indeed
I
do
n't
know
,
sir
,
'
replied
Oliver
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Bah
!
'
said
the
Jew
,
turning
away
with
a
disappointed
countenance
from
*NL*
a
close
perusal
of
the
boy
's
face
.
`
Wait
till
Bill
tells
you
,
then
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
Jew
seemed
much
vexed
by
Oliver
's
not
expressing
any
greater
*NL*
curiosity
on
the
subject
;
but
the
truth
is
,
that
,
although
Oliver
felt
*NL*
very
anxious
,
he
was
too
much
confused
by
the
earnest
cunning
of
*NL*
Fagin
's
looks
,
and
his
own
speculations
,
to
make
any
further
inquiries
*NL*
just
then
.
He
had
no
other
opportunity
:
for
the
Jew
remained
very
*NL*
surly
and
silent
till
night
:
when
he
prepared
to
go
abroad
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
may
burn
a
candle
,
'
said
the
Jew
,
putting
one
upon
the
table
.
*NL*
`
And
here
's
a
book
for
you
to
read
,
till
they
come
to
fetch
you
.
*NL*
Good-night
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Good-night
!
'
replied
Oliver
,
softly
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Jew
walked
to
the
door
:
looking
over
his
shoulder
at
the
boy
as
he
*NL*
went
.
Suddenly
stopping
,
he
called
him
by
his
name
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oliver
looked
up
;
the
Jew
,
pointing
to
the
candle
,
motioned
him
to
*NL*
light
it
.
He
did
so
;
and
,
as
he
placed
the
candlestick
upon
the
table
,
*NL*
saw
that
the
Jew
was
gazing
fixedly
at
him
,
with
lowering
and
*NL*
contracted
brows
,
from
the
dark
end
of
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Take
heed
,
Oliver
!
take
heed
!
'
said
the
old
man
,
shaking
his
right
*NL*
hand
before
him
in
a
warning
manner
.
`
He
's
a
rough
man
,
and
thinks
*NL*
nothing
of
blood
when
his
own
is
up
.
Whatever
falls
out
,
say
nothing
;
*NL*
and
do
what
he
bids
you
.
Mind
!
'
Placing
a
strong
emphasis
on
the
last
*NL*
word
,
he
suffered
his
features
gradually
to
resolve
themselves
into
a
*NL*
ghastly
grin
,
and
,
nodding
his
head
,
left
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oliver
leaned
his
head
upon
his
hand
when
the
old
man
disappeared
,
and
*NL*
pondered
,
with
a
trembling
heart
,
on
the
words
he
had
just
heard
.
The
*NL*
more
he
thought
of
the
Jew
's
admonition
,
the
more
he
was
at
a
loss
to
*NL*
divine
its
real
purpose
and
meaning
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
think
of
no
bad
object
to
be
attained
by
sending
him
to
Sikes
,
*NL*
which
would
not
be
equally
well
answered
by
his
remaining
with
Fagin
;
*NL*
and
after
meditating
for
a
long
time
,
concluded
that
he
had
been
*NL*
selected
to
perform
some
ordinary
menial
offices
for
the
housebreaker
,
*NL*
until
another
boy
,
better
suited
for
his
purpose
could
be
engaged
.
He
*NL*
was
too
well
accustomed
to
suffering
,
and
had
suffered
too
much
where
*NL*
he
was
,
to
bewail
the
prospect
of
change
very
severely
.
He
remained
*NL*
lost
in
thought
for
some
minutes
;
and
then
,
with
a
heavy
sigh
,
snuffed
*NL*
the
candle
,
and
,
taking
up
the
book
which
the
Jew
had
left
with
him
,
*NL*
began
to
read
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
over
the
leaves
.
Carelessly
at
first
;
but
,
lighting
on
a
*NL*
passage
which
attracted
his
attention
,
he
soon
became
intent
upon
the
*NL*
volume
.
It
was
a
history
of
the
lives
and
trials
of
great
criminals
;
*NL*
and
the
pages
were
soiled
and
thumbed
with
use
.
Here
,
he
read
of
*NL*
dreadful
crimes
that
made
the
blood
run
cold
;
of
secret
murders
that
*NL*
had
been
committed
by
the
lonely
wayside
;
of
bodies
hidden
from
the
eye
*NL*
of
man
in
deep
pits
and
wells
:
which
would
not
keep
them
down
,
deep
as
*NL*
they
were
,
but
had
yielded
them
up
at
last
,
after
many
years
,
and
so
*NL*
maddened
the
murderers
with
the
sight
,
that
in
their
horror
they
had
*NL*
confessed
their
guilt
,
and
yelled
for
the
gibbet
to
end
their
agony
.
*NL*
Here
,
too
,
he
read
of
men
who
,
lying
in
their
beds
at
dead
of
night
,
*NL*
had
been
tempted
-LRB-
so
they
said
-RRB-
and
led
on
,
by
their
own
bad
thoughts
,
*NL*
to
such
dreadful
bloodshed
as
it
made
the
flesh
creep
,
and
the
limbs
*NL*
quail
,
to
think
of
.
The
terrible
descriptions
were
so
real
and
vivid
,
*NL*
that
the
sallow
pages
seemed
to
turn
red
with
gore
;
and
the
words
upon
*NL*
them
,
to
be
sounded
in
his
ears
,
as
if
they
were
whispered
,
in
hollow
*NL*
murmurs
,
by
the
spirits
of
the
dead
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
paroxysm
of
fear
,
the
boy
closed
the
book
,
and
thrust
it
from
him
.
*NL*
Then
,
falling
upon
his
knees
,
he
prayed
Heaven
to
spare
him
from
such
*NL*
deeds
;
and
rather
to
will
that
he
should
die
at
once
,
than
be
reserved
*NL*
for
crimes
,
so
fearful
and
appalling
.
By
degrees
,
he
grew
more
calm
,
*NL*
and
besought
,
in
a
low
and
broken
voice
,
that
he
might
be
rescued
from
*NL*
his
present
dangers
;
and
that
if
any
aid
were
to
be
raised
up
for
a
*NL*
poor
outcast
boy
who
had
never
known
the
love
of
friends
or
kindred
,
it
*NL*
might
come
to
him
now
,
when
,
desolate
and
deserted
,
he
stood
alone
in
*NL*
the
midst
of
wickedness
and
guilt
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
concluded
his
prayer
,
but
still
remained
with
his
head
buried
in
*NL*
his
hands
,
when
a
rustling
noise
aroused
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
's
that
!
'
he
cried
,
starting
up
,
and
catching
sight
of
a
figure
*NL*
standing
by
the
door
.
`
Who
's
there
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Me
.
Only
me
,
'
replied
a
tremulous
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oliver
raised
the
candle
above
his
head
:
and
looked
towards
the
door
.
*NL*
It
was
Nancy
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Put
down
the
light
,
'
said
the
girl
,
turning
away
her
head
.
`
It
hurts
*NL*
my
eyes
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Oliver
saw
that
she
was
very
pale
,
and
gently
inquired
if
she
were
ill
.
*NL*
The
girl
threw
herself
into
a
chair
,
with
her
back
towards
him
:
and
*NL*
wrung
her
hands
;
but
made
no
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
God
forgive
me
!
'
she
cried
after
a
while
,
'
I
never
thought
of
this
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Has
anything
happened
?
'
asked
Oliver
.
`
Can
I
help
you
?
I
will
if
I
*NL*
can
.
I
will
,
indeed
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
rocked
herself
to
and
fro
;
caught
her
throat
;
and
,
uttering
a
*NL*
gurgling
sound
,
gasped
for
breath
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Nancy
!
'
cried
Oliver
,
`
What
is
it
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
girl
beat
her
hands
upon
her
knees
,
and
her
feet
upon
the
ground
;
*NL*
and
,
suddenly
stopping
,
drew
her
shawl
close
round
her
:
and
shivered
*NL*
with
cold
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oliver
stirred
the
fire
.
Drawing
her
chair
close
to
it
,
she
sat
there
,
*NL*
for
a
little
time
,
without
speaking
;
but
at
length
she
raised
her
head
,
*NL*
and
looked
round
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
do
n't
know
what
comes
over
me
sometimes
,
'
said
she
,
affecting
to
*NL*
busy
herself
in
arranging
her
dress
;
`
it
's
this
damp
dirty
room
,
I
*NL*
think
.
Now
,
Nolly
,
dear
,
are
you
ready
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Am
I
to
go
with
you
?
'
asked
Oliver
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
.
I
have
come
from
Bill
,
'
replied
the
girl
.
`
You
are
to
go
with
*NL*
me
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
for
?
'
asked
Oliver
,
recoiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
for
?
'
echoed
the
girl
,
raising
her
eyes
,
and
averting
them
again
,
*NL*
the
moment
they
encountered
the
boy
's
face
.
`
Oh
!
For
no
harm
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
do
n't
believe
it
,
'
said
Oliver
:
who
had
watched
her
closely
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Have
it
your
own
way
,
'
rejoined
the
girl
,
affecting
to
laugh
.
`
For
no
*NL*
good
,
then
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Oliver
could
see
that
he
had
some
power
over
the
girl
's
better
*NL*
feelings
,
and
,
for
an
instant
,
thought
of
appealing
to
her
compassion
*NL*
for
his
helpless
state
.
But
,
then
,
the
thought
darted
across
his
mind
*NL*
that
it
was
barely
eleven
o'clock
;
and
that
many
people
were
still
in
*NL*
the
streets
:
of
whom
surely
some
might
be
found
to
give
credence
to
*NL*
his
tale
.
As
the
reflection
occured
to
him
,
he
stepped
forward
:
and
*NL*
said
,
somewhat
hastily
,
that
he
was
ready
.
*NL*
*NL*
Neither
his
brief
consideration
,
nor
its
purport
,
was
lost
on
his
*NL*
companion
.
She
eyed
him
narrowly
,
while
he
spoke
;
and
cast
upon
him
a
*NL*
look
of
intelligence
which
sufficiently
showed
that
she
guessed
what
*NL*
had
been
passing
in
his
thoughts
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Hush
!
'
said
the
girl
,
stooping
over
him
,
and
pointing
to
the
door
as
*NL*
she
looked
cautiously
round
.
`
You

n't
help
yourself
.
I
have
tried
*NL*
hard
for
you
,
but
all
to
no
purpose
.
You
are
hedged
round
and
round
.
*NL*
If
ever
you
are
to
get
loose
from
here
,
this
is
not
the
time
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Struck
by
the
energy
of
her
manner
,
Oliver
looked
up
in
her
face
with
*NL*
great
surprise
.
She
seemed
to
speak
the
truth
;
her
countenance
was
*NL*
white
and
agitated
;
and
she
trembled
with
very
earnestness
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
have
saved
you
from
being
ill-used
once
,
and
I
will
again
,
and
I
do
*NL*
now
,
'
continued
the
girl
aloud
;
`
for
those
who
would
have
fetched
you
,
*NL*
if
I
had
not
,
would
have
been
far
more
rough
than
me
.
I
have
promised
*NL*
for
your
being
quiet
and
silent
;
if
you
are
not
,
you
will
only
do
harm
*NL*
to
yourself
and
me
too
,
and
perhaps
be
my
death
.
See
here
!
I
have
*NL*
borne
all
this
for
you
already
,
as
true
as
God
sees
me
show
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
pointed
,
hastily
,
to
some
livid
bruises
on
her
neck
and
arms
;
and
*NL*
continued
,
with
great
rapidity
:
*NL*
*NL*
`
Remember
this
!
And
do
n't
let
me
suffer
more
for
you
,
just
now
.
If
I
*NL*
could
help
you
,
I
would
;
but
I
have
not
the
power
.
They
do
n't
mean
to
*NL*
harm
you
;
whatever
they
make
you
do
,
is
no
fault
of
yours
.
Hush
!
*NL*
Every
word
from
you
is
a
blow
for
me
.
Give
me
your
hand
.
Make
haste
!
*NL*
Your
hand
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
caught
the
hand
which
Oliver
instinctively
placed
in
hers
,
and
,
*NL*
blowing
out
the
light
,
drew
him
after
her
up
the
stairs
.
The
door
was
*NL*
opened
,
quickly
,
by
some
one
shrouded
in
the
darkness
,
and
was
as
*NL*
quickly
closed
,
when
they
had
passed
out
.
A
hackney-cabriolet
was
in
*NL*
waiting
;
with
the
same
vehemence
which
she
had
exhibited
in
addressing
*NL*
Oliver
,
the
girl
pulled
him
in
with
her
,
and
drew
the
curtains
close
.
*NL*
The
driver
wanted
no
directions
,
but
lashed
his
horse
into
full
speed
,
*NL*
without
the
delay
of
an
instant
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
girl
still
held
Oliver
fast
by
the
hand
,
and
continued
to
pour
into
*NL*
his
ear
,
the
warnings
and
assurances
she
had
already
imparted
.
All
was
*NL*
so
quick
and
hurried
,
that
he
had
scarcely
time
to
recollect
where
he
*NL*
was
,
or
how
he
came
there
,
when
the
carriage
stopped
at
the
house
to
*NL*
which
the
Jew
's
steps
had
been
directed
on
the
previous
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
one
brief
moment
,
Oliver
cast
a
hurried
glance
along
the
empty
*NL*
street
,
and
a
cry
for
help
hung
upon
his
lips
.
But
the
girl
's
voice
*NL*
was
in
his
ear
,
beseeching
him
in
such
tones
of
agony
to
remember
her
,
*NL*
that
he
had
not
the
heart
to
utter
it
.
While
he
hesitated
,
the
*NL*
opportunity
was
gone
;
he
was
already
in
the
house
,
and
the
door
was
*NL*
shut
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
This
way
,
'
said
the
girl
,
releasing
her
hold
for
the
first
time
.
*NL*
`
Bill
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Hallo
!
'
replied
Sikes
:
appearing
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
,
with
a
*NL*
candle
.
`
Oh
!
That
's
the
time
of
day
.
Come
on
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
a
very
strong
expression
of
approbation
,
an
uncommonly
hearty
*NL*
welcome
,
from
a
person
of
Mr.
Sikes
'
temperament
.
Nancy
,
appearing
*NL*
much
gratified
thereby
,
saluted
him
cordially
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Bull
's
-
eye
's
gone
home
with
Tom
,
'
observed
Sikes
,
as
he
lighted
them
*NL*
up
.
`
He
'd
have
been
in
the
way
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
's
right
,
'
rejoined
Nancy
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
So
you
've
got
the
kid
,
'
said
Sikes
when
they
had
all
reached
the
room
:
*NL*
closing
the
door
as
he
spoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
here
he
is
,
'
replied
Nancy
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Did
he
come
quiet
?
'
inquired
Sikes
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Like
a
lamb
,
'
rejoined
Nancy
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
'm
glad
to
hear
it
,
'
said
Sikes
,
looking
grimly
at
Oliver
;
`
for
the
*NL*
sake
of
his
young
carcase
:
as
would
otherways
have
suffered
for
it
.
*NL*
Come
here
,
young
`
un
;
and
let
me
read
you
a
lectur
'
,
which
is
as
well
*NL*
got
over
at
once
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
addressing
his
new
pupil
,
Mr.
Sikes
pulled
off
Oliver
's
cap
and
*NL*
threw
it
into
a
corner
;
and
then
,
taking
him
by
the
shoulder
,
sat
*NL*
himself
down
by
the
table
,
and
stood
the
boy
in
front
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Now
,
first
:
do
you
know
wot
this
is
?
'
inquired
Sikes
,
taking
up
a
*NL*
pocket-pistol
which
lay
on
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oliver
replied
in
the
affirmative
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
then
,
look
here
,
'
continued
Sikes
.
`
This
is
powder
;
that
`
ere
's
*NL*
a
bullet
;
and
this
is
a
little
bit
of
a
old
hat
for
waddin
'
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Oliver
murmured
his
comprehension
of
the
different
bodies
referred
to
;
*NL*
and
Mr.
Sikes
proceeded
to
load
the
pistol
,
with
great
nicety
and
*NL*
deliberation
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Now
it
's
loaded
,
'
said
Mr.
Sikes
,
when
he
had
finished
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
I
see
it
is
,
sir
,
'
replied
Oliver
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
'
said
the
robber
,
grasping
Oliver
's
wrist
,
and
putting
the
*NL*
barrel
so
close
to
his
temple
that
they
touched
;
at
which
moment
the
*NL*
boy
could
not
repress
a
start
;
`
if
you
speak
a
word
when
you
're
out
*NL*
o'doors
with
me
,
except
when
I
speak
to
you
,
that
loading
will
be
in
*NL*
your
head
without
notice
.
So
,
if
you
_
do
_
make
up
your
mind
to
speak
*NL*
without
leave
,
say
your
prayers
first
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Having
bestowed
a
scowl
upon
the
object
of
this
warning
,
to
increase
*NL*
its
effect
,
Mr.
Sikes
continued
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
As
near
as
I
know
,
there
is
n't
anybody
as
would
be
asking
very
*NL*
partickler
arter
you
,
if
you
_
was
_
disposed
of
;
so
I
need
n't
take
this
*NL*
devil-and-all
of
trouble
to
explain
matters
to
you
,
if
it
war
n't
for
*NL*
your
own
good
.
D'ye
hear
me
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
short
and
the
long
of
what
you
mean
,
'
said
Nancy
:
speaking
very
*NL*
emphatically
,
and
slightly
frowning
at
Oliver
as
if
to
bespeak
his
*NL*
serious
attention
to
her
words
:
`
is
,
that
if
you
're
crossed
by
him
in
*NL*
this
job
you
have
on
hand
,
you
'll
prevent
his
ever
telling
tales
*NL*
afterwards
,
by
shooting
him
through
the
head
,
and
will
take
your
chance
*NL*
of
swinging
for
it
,
as
you
do
for
a
great
many
other
things
in
the
way
*NL*
of
business
,
every
month
of
your
life
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
's
it
!
'
observed
Mr.
Sikes
,
approvingly
;
`
women
can
always
put
*NL*
things
in
fewest
words
.
--
Except
when
it
's
blowing
up
;
and
then
they
*NL*
lengthens
it
out
.
And
now
that
he
's
thoroughly
up
to
it
,
let
's
have
*NL*
some
supper
,
and
get
a
snooze
before
starting
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
In
pursuance
of
this
request
,
Nancy
quickly
laid
the
cloth
;
*NL*
disappearing
for
a
few
minutes
,
she
presently
returned
with
a
pot
of
*NL*
porter
and
a
dish
of
sheep
's
heads
:
which
gave
occasion
to
several
*NL*
pleasant
witticisms
on
the
part
of
Mr.
Sikes
,
founded
upon
the
singular
*NL*
coincidence
of
`
jemmies
'
being
a
can
name
,
common
to
them
,
and
also
to
*NL*
an
ingenious
implement
much
used
in
his
profession
.
Indeed
,
the
worthy
*NL*
gentleman
,
stimulated
perhaps
by
the
immediate
prospect
of
being
on
*NL*
active
service
,
was
in
great
spirits
and
good
humour
;
in
proof
whereof
,
*NL*
it
may
be
here
remarked
,
that
he
humourously
drank
all
the
beer
at
a
*NL*
draught
,
and
did
not
utter
,
on
a
rough
calculation
,
more
than
*NL*
four-score
oaths
during
the
whole
progress
of
the
meal
.
*NL*
*NL*
Supper
being
ended
--
it
may
be
easily
conceived
that
Oliver
had
no
great
*NL*
appetite
for
it
--
Mr.
Sikes
disposed
of
a
couple
of
glasses
of
spirits
*NL*
and
water
,
and
threw
himself
on
the
bed
;
ordering
Nancy
,
with
many
*NL*
imprecations
in
case
of
failure
,
to
call
him
at
five
precisely
.
Oliver
*NL*
stretched
himself
in
his
clothes
,
by
command
of
the
same
authority
,
on
*NL*
a
mattress
upon
the
floor
;
and
the
girl
,
mending
the
fire
,
sat
before
*NL*
it
,
in
readiness
to
rouse
them
at
the
appointed
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
long
time
Oliver
lay
awake
,
thinking
it
not
impossible
that
Nancy
*NL*
might
seek
that
opportunity
of
whispering
some
further
advice
;
but
the
*NL*
girl
sat
brooding
over
the
fire
,
without
moving
,
save
now
and
then
to
*NL*
trim
the
light
.
Weary
with
watching
and
anxiety
,
he
at
length
fell
*NL*
asleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
awoke
,
the
table
was
covered
with
tea-things
,
and
Sikes
was
*NL*
thrusting
various
articles
into
the
pockets
of
his
great-coat
,
which
*NL*
hung
over
the
back
of
a
chair
.
Nancy
was
busily
engaged
in
preparing
*NL*
breakfast
.
It
was
not
yet
daylight
;
for
the
candle
was
still
burning
,
*NL*
and
it
was
quite
dark
outside
.
A
sharp
rain
,
too
,
was
beating
against
*NL*
the
window-panes
;
and
the
sky
looked
black
and
cloudy
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Now
,
then
!
'
growled
Sikes
,
as
Oliver
started
up
;
`
half-past
five
!
*NL*
Look
sharp
,
or
you
'll
get
no
breakfast
;
for
it
's
late
as
it
is
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Oliver
was
not
long
in
making
his
toilet
;
having
taken
some
breakfast
,
*NL*
he
replied
to
a
surly
inquiry
from
Sikes
,
by
saying
that
he
was
quite
*NL*
ready
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nancy
,
scarcely
looking
at
the
boy
,
threw
him
a
handkerchief
to
tie
*NL*
round
his
throat
;
Sikes
gave
him
a
large
rough
cape
to
button
over
his
*NL*
shoulders
.
Thus
attired
,
he
gave
his
hand
to
the
robber
,
who
,
merely
*NL*
pausing
to
show
him
with
a
menacing
gesture
that
he
had
that
same
*NL*
pistol
in
a
side-pocket
of
his
great-coat
,
clasped
it
firmly
in
his
,
*NL*
and
,
exchanging
a
farewell
with
Nancy
,
led
him
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oliver
turned
,
for
an
instant
,
when
they
reached
the
door
,
in
the
hope
*NL*
of
meeting
a
look
from
the
girl
.
But
she
had
resumed
her
old
seat
in
*NL*
front
of
the
fire
,
and
sat
,
perfectly
motionless
before
it
.

CHAPTER
XXI
*NL*
*NL*
THE
EXPEDITION
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
cheerless
morning
when
they
got
into
the
street
;
blowing
and
*NL*
raining
hard
;
and
the
clouds
looking
dull
and
stormy
.
The
night
had
*NL*
been
very
wet
:
large
pools
of
water
had
collected
in
the
road
:
and
the
*NL*
kennels
were
overflowing
.
There
was
a
faint
glimmering
of
the
coming
*NL*
day
in
the
sky
;
but
it
rather
aggravated
than
relieved
the
gloom
of
the
*NL*
scene
:
the
sombre
light
only
serving
to
pale
that
which
the
street
*NL*
lamps
afforded
,
without
shedding
any
warmer
or
brighter
tints
upon
the
*NL*
wet
house-tops
,
and
dreary
streets
.
There
appeared
to
be
nobody
*NL*
stirring
in
that
quarter
of
the
town
;
the
windows
of
the
houses
were
*NL*
all
closely
shut
;
and
the
streets
through
which
they
passed
,
were
*NL*
noiseless
and
empty
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
the
time
they
had
turned
into
the
Bethnal
Green
Road
,
the
day
had
*NL*
fairly
begun
to
break
.
Many
of
the
lamps
were
already
extinguished
;
a
*NL*
few
country
waggons
were
slowly
toiling
on
,
towards
London
;
now
and
*NL*
then
,
a
stage-coach
,
covered
with
mud
,
rattled
briskly
by
:
the
driver
*NL*
bestowing
,
as
he
passed
,
an
admonitory
lash
upon
the
heavy
waggoner
*NL*
who
,
by
keeping
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
road
,
had
endangered
his
*NL*
arriving
at
the
office
,
a
quarter
of
a
minute
after
his
time
.
The
*NL*
public-houses
,
with
gas-lights
burning
inside
,
were
already
open
.
By
*NL*
degrees
,
other
shops
began
to
be
unclosed
,
and
a
few
scattered
people
*NL*
were
met
with
.
Then
,
came
straggling
groups
of
labourers
going
to
*NL*
their
work
;
then
,
men
and
women
with
fish-baskets
on
their
heads
;
*NL*
donkey-carts
laden
with
vegetables
;
chaise-carts
filled
with
live-stock
*NL*
or
whole
carcasses
of
meat
;
milk-women
with
pails
;
an
unbroken
*NL*
concourse
of
people
,
trudging
out
with
various
supplies
to
the
eastern
*NL*
suburbs
of
the
town
.
As
they
approached
the
City
,
the
noise
and
*NL*
traffic
gradually
increased
;
when
they
threaded
the
streets
between
*NL*
Shoreditch
and
Smithfield
,
it
had
swelled
into
a
roar
of
sound
and
*NL*
bustle
.
It
was
as
light
as
it
was
likely
to
be
,
till
night
came
on
*NL*
again
,
and
the
busy
morning
of
half
the
London
population
had
begun
.
*NL*
*NL*
Turning
down
Sun
Street
and
Crown
Street
,
and
crossing
Finsbury
square
,
*NL*
Mr.
Sikes
struck
,
by
way
of
Chiswell
Street
,
into
Barbican
:
thence
into
*NL*
Long
Lane
,
and
so
into
Smithfield
;
from
which
latter
place
arose
a
*NL*
tumult
of
discordant
sounds
that
filled
Oliver
Twist
with
amazement
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
market-morning
.
The
ground
was
covered
,
nearly
ankle-deep
,
with
*NL*
filth
and
mire
;
a
thick
steam
,
perpetually
rising
from
the
reeking
*NL*
bodies
of
the
cattle
,
and
mingling
with
the
fog
,
which
seemed
to
rest
*NL*
upon
the
chimney-tops
,
hung
heavily
above
.
All
the
pens
in
the
centre
*NL*
of
the
large
area
,
and
as
many
temporary
pens
as
could
be
crowded
into
*NL*
the
vacant
space
,
were
filled
with
sheep
;
tied
up
to
posts
by
the
*NL*
gutter
side
were
long
lines
of
beasts
and
oxen
,
three
or
four
deep
.
*NL*
Countrymen
,
butchers
,
drovers
,
hawkers
,
boys
,
thieves
,
idlers
,
and
*NL*
vagabonds
of
every
low
grade
,
were
mingled
together
in
a
mass
;
the
*NL*
whistling
of
drovers
,
the
barking
dogs
,
the
bellowing
and
plunging
of
*NL*
the
oxen
,
the
bleating
of
sheep
,
the
grunting
and
squeaking
of
pigs
,
*NL*
the
cries
of
hawkers
,
the
shouts
,
oaths
,
and
quarrelling
on
all
sides
;
*NL*
the
ringing
of
bells
and
roar
of
voices
,
that
issued
from
every
*NL*
public-house
;
the
crowding
,
pushing
,
driving
,
beating
,
whooping
and
*NL*
yelling
;
the
hideous
and
discordant
dim
that
resounded
from
every
*NL*
corner
of
the
market
;
and
the
unwashed
,
unshaven
,
squalid
,
and
dirty
*NL*
figures
constantly
running
to
and
fro
,
and
bursting
in
and
out
of
the
*NL*
throng
;
rendered
it
a
stunning
and
bewildering
scene
,
which
quite
*NL*
confounded
the
senses
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Sikes
,
dragging
Oliver
after
him
,
elbowed
his
way
through
the
*NL*
thickest
of
the
crowd
,
and
bestowed
very
little
attention
on
the
*NL*
numerous
sights
and
sounds
,
which
so
astonished
the
boy
.
He
nodded
,
*NL*
twice
or
thrice
,
to
a
passing
friend
;
and
,
resisting
as
many
*NL*
invitations
to
take
a
morning
dram
,
pressed
steadily
onward
,
until
they
*NL*
were
clear
of
the
turmoil
,
and
had
made
their
way
through
Hosier
Lane
*NL*
into
Holborn
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Now
,
young
`
un
!
'
said
Sikes
,
looking
up
at
the
clock
of
St.
Andrew
's
*NL*
Church
,
`
hard
upon
seven
!
you
must
step
out
.
Come
,
do
n't
lag
behind
*NL*
already
,
Lazy-legs
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Sikes
accompanied
this
speech
with
a
jerk
at
his
little
companion
's
*NL*
wrist
;
Oliver
,
quickening
his
pace
into
a
kind
of
trot
between
a
fast
*NL*
walk
and
a
run
,
kept
up
with
the
rapid
strides
of
the
house-breaker
as
*NL*
well
as
he
could
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
held
their
course
at
this
rate
,
until
they
had
passed
Hyde
Park
*NL*
corner
,
and
were
on
their
way
to
Kensington
:
when
Sikes
relaxed
his
*NL*
pace
,
until
an
empty
cart
which
was
at
some
little
distance
behind
,
*NL*
came
up
.
Seeing
`
Hounslow
'
written
on
it
,
he
asked
the
driver
with
as
*NL*
much
civility
as
he
could
assume
,
if
he
would
give
them
a
lift
as
far
*NL*
as
Isleworth
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Jump
up
,
'
said
the
man
.
`
Is
that
your
boy
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
;
he
's
my
boy
,
'
replied
Sikes
,
looking
hard
at
Oliver
,
and
putting
*NL*
his
hand
abstractedly
into
the
pocket
where
the
pistol
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Your
father
walks
rather
too
quick
for
you
,
do
n't
he
,
my
man
?
'
*NL*
inquired
the
driver
:
seeing
that
Oliver
was
out
of
breath
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Not
a
bit
of
it
,
'
replied
Sikes
,
interposing
.
`
He
's
used
to
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
,
take
hold
of
my
hand
,
Ned
.
In
with
you
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
addressing
Oliver
,
he
helped
him
into
the
cart
;
and
the
driver
,
*NL*
pointing
to
a
heap
of
sacks
,
told
him
to
lie
down
there
,
and
rest
*NL*
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
passed
the
different
mile-stones
,
Oliver
wondered
,
more
and
*NL*
more
,
where
his
companion
meant
to
take
him
.
Kensington
,
Hammersmith
,
*NL*
Chiswick
,
Kew
Bridge
,
Brentford
,
were
all
passed
;
and
yet
they
went
on
*NL*
as
steadily
as
if
they
had
only
just
begun
their
journey
.
At
length
,
*NL*
they
came
to
a
public-house
called
the
Coach
and
Horses
;
a
little
way
*NL*
beyond
which
,
another
road
appeared
to
run
off
.
And
here
,
the
cart
*NL*
stopped
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sikes
dismounted
with
great
precipitation
,
holding
Oliver
by
the
hand
*NL*
all
the
while
;
and
lifting
him
down
directly
,
bestowed
a
furious
look
*NL*
upon
him
,
and
rapped
the
side-pocket
with
his
fist
,
in
a
significant
*NL*
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Good-bye
,
boy
,
'
said
the
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
's
sulky
,
'
replied
Sikes
,
giving
him
a
shake
;
`
he
's
sulky
.
A
young
*NL*
dog
!
Do
n't
mind
him
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Not
I
!
'
rejoined
the
other
,
getting
into
his
cart
.
`
It
's
a
fine
day
,
*NL*
after
all
.
'
And
he
drove
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sikes
waited
until
he
had
fairly
gone
;
and
then
,
telling
Oliver
he
*NL*
might
look
about
him
if
he
wanted
,
once
again
led
him
onward
on
his
*NL*
journey
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
turned
round
to
the
left
,
a
short
way
past
the
public-house
;
and
*NL*
then
,
taking
a
right-hand
road
,
walked
on
for
a
long
time
:
passing
many
*NL*
large
gardens
and
gentlemen
's
houses
on
both
sides
of
the
way
,
and
*NL*
stopping
for
nothing
but
a
little
beer
,
until
they
reached
a
town
.
*NL*
Here
against
the
wall
of
a
house
,
Oliver
saw
written
up
in
pretty
large
*NL*
letters
,
`
Hampton
.
'
They
lingered
about
,
in
the
fields
,
for
some
*NL*
hours
.
At
length
they
came
back
into
the
town
;
and
,
turning
into
an
*NL*
old
public-house
with
a
defaced
sign-board
,
ordered
some
dinner
by
the
*NL*
kitchen
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
kitchen
was
an
old
,
low-roofed
room
;
with
a
great
beam
across
the
*NL*
middle
of
the
ceiling
,
and
benches
,
with
high
backs
to
them
,
by
the
*NL*
fire
;
on
which
were
seated
several
rough
men
in
smock-frocks
,
drinking
*NL*
and
smoking
.
They
took
no
notice
of
Oliver
;
and
very
little
of
Sikes
;
*NL*
and
,
as
Sikes
took
very
little
notice
of
them
,
he
and
his
young
comrade
*NL*
sat
in
a
corner
by
themselves
,
without
being
much
troubled
by
their
*NL*
company
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
some
cold
meat
for
dinner
,
and
sat
so
long
after
it
,
while
Mr.
*NL*
Sikes
indulged
himself
with
three
or
four
pipes
,
that
Oliver
began
to
*NL*
feel
quite
certain
they
were
not
going
any
further
.
Being
much
tired
*NL*
with
the
walk
,
and
getting
up
so
early
,
he
dozed
a
little
at
first
;
*NL*
then
,
quite
overpowered
by
fatigue
and
the
fumes
of
the
tobacco
,
fell
*NL*
asleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
quite
dark
when
he
was
awakened
by
a
push
from
Sikes
.
Rousing
*NL*
himself
sufficiently
to
sit
up
and
look
about
him
,
he
found
that
worthy
*NL*
in
close
fellowship
and
communication
with
a
labouring
man
,
over
a
pint
*NL*
of
ale
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
So
,
you
're
going
on
to
Lower
Halliford
,
are
you
?
'
inquired
Sikes
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
I
am
,
'
replied
the
man
,
who
seemed
a
little
the
worse
--
or
better
,
*NL*
as
the
case
might
be
--
for
drinking
;
`
and
not
slow
about
it
neither
.
My
*NL*
horse
has
n't
got
a
load
behind
him
going
back
,
as
he
had
coming
up
in
*NL*
the
mornin
'
;
and
he
wo
n't
be
long
a-doing
of
it
.
Here
's
luck
to
him
.
*NL*
Ecod
!
he
's
a
good
`
un
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Could
you
give
my
boy
and
me
a
lift
as
far
as
there
?
'
demanded
Sikes
,
*NL*
pushing
the
ale
towards
his
new
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
If
you
're
going
directly
,
I
can
,
'
replied
the
man
,
looking
out
of
the
*NL*
pot
.
`
Are
you
going
to
Halliford
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Going
on
to
Shepperton
,
'
replied
Sikes
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
'm
your
man
,
as
far
as
I
go
,
'
replied
the
other
.
`
Is
all
paid
,
*NL*
Becky
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
the
other
gentleman
's
paid
,
'
replied
the
girl
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
say
!
'
said
the
man
,
with
tipsy
gravity
;
`
that
wo
n't
do
,
you
know
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
not
?
'
rejoined
Sikes
.
`
You
're
a-going
to
accommodate
us
,
and
*NL*
wot
's
to
prevent
my
standing
treat
for
a
pint
or
so
,
in
return
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
stranger
reflected
upon
this
argument
,
with
a
very
profound
face
;
*NL*
having
done
so
,
he
seized
Sikes
by
the
hand
:
and
declared
he
was
a
*NL*
real
good
fellow
.
To
which
Mr.
Sikes
replied
,
he
was
joking
;
as
,
if
he
*NL*
had
been
sober
,
there
would
have
been
strong
reason
to
suppose
he
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
exchange
of
a
few
more
compliments
,
they
bade
the
company
*NL*
good-night
,
and
went
out
;
the
girl
gathering
up
the
pots
and
glasses
as
*NL*
they
did
so
,
and
lounging
out
to
the
door
,
with
her
hands
full
,
to
see
*NL*
the
party
start
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
horse
,
whose
health
had
been
drunk
in
his
absence
,
was
standing
*NL*
outside
:
ready
harnessed
to
the
cart
.
Oliver
and
Sikes
got
in
without
*NL*
any
further
ceremony
;
and
the
man
to
whom
he
belonged
,
having
lingered
*NL*
for
a
minute
or
two
`
to
bear
him
up
,
'
and
to
defy
the
hostler
and
the
*NL*
world
to
produce
his
equal
,
mounted
also
.
Then
,
the
hostler
was
told
*NL*
to
give
the
horse
his
head
;
and
,
his
head
being
given
him
,
he
made
a
*NL*
very
unpleasant
use
of
it
:
tossing
it
into
the
air
with
great
disdain
,
*NL*
and
running
into
the
parlour
windows
over
the
way
;
after
performing
*NL*
those
feats
,
and
supporting
himself
for
a
short
time
on
his
hind-legs
,
*NL*
he
started
off
at
great
speed
,
and
rattled
out
of
the
town
right
*NL*
gallantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
night
was
very
dark
.
A
damp
mist
rose
from
the
river
,
and
the
*NL*
marshy
ground
about
;
and
spread
itself
over
the
dreary
fields
.
It
was
*NL*
piercing
cold
,
too
;
all
was
gloomy
and
black
.
Not
a
word
was
spoken
;
*NL*
for
the
driver
had
grown
sleepy
;
and
Sikes
was
in
no
mood
to
lead
him
*NL*
into
conversation
.
Oliver
sat
huddled
together
,
in
a
corner
of
the
*NL*
cart
;
bewildered
with
alarm
and
apprehension
;
and
figuring
strange
*NL*
objects
in
the
gaunt
trees
,
whose
branches
waved
grimly
to
and
fro
,
as
*NL*
if
in
some
fantastic
joy
at
the
desolation
of
the
scene
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
passed
Sunbury
Church
,
the
clock
struck
seven
.
There
was
a
*NL*
light
in
the
ferry-house
window
opposite
:
which
streamed
across
the
*NL*
road
,
and
threw
into
more
sombre
shadow
a
dark
yew-tree
with
graves
*NL*
beneath
it
.
There
was
a
dull
sound
of
falling
water
not
far
off
;
and
*NL*
the
leaves
of
the
old
tree
stirred
gently
in
the
night
wind
.
It
seemed
*NL*
like
quiet
music
for
the
repose
of
the
dead
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sunbury
was
passed
through
,
and
they
came
again
into
the
lonely
road
.
*NL*
Two
or
three
miles
more
,
and
the
cart
stopped
.
Sikes
alighted
,
took
*NL*
Oliver
by
the
hand
,
and
they
once
again
walked
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
turned
into
no
house
at
Shepperton
,
as
the
weary
boy
had
expected
;
*NL*
but
still
kept
walking
on
,
in
mud
and
darkness
,
through
gloomy
lanes
*NL*
and
over
cold
open
wastes
,
until
they
came
within
sight
of
the
lights
*NL*
of
a
town
at
no
great
distance
.
On
looking
intently
forward
,
Oliver
*NL*
saw
that
the
water
was
just
below
them
,
and
that
they
were
coming
to
*NL*
the
foot
of
a
bridge
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sikes
kept
straight
on
,
until
they
were
close
upon
the
bridge
;
then
*NL*
turned
suddenly
down
a
bank
upon
the
left
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
water
!
'
thought
Oliver
,
turning
sick
with
fear
.
`
He
has
brought
*NL*
me
to
this
lonely
place
to
murder
me
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
about
to
throw
himself
on
the
ground
,
and
make
one
struggle
for
*NL*
his
young
life
,
when
he
saw
that
they
stood
before
a
solitary
house
:
*NL*
all
ruinous
and
decayed
.
There
was
a
window
on
each
side
of
the
*NL*
dilapidated
entrance
;
and
one
story
above
;
but
no
light
was
visible
.
*NL*
The
house
was
dark
,
dismantled
:
and
the
all
appearance
,
uninhabited
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sikes
,
with
Oliver
's
hand
still
in
his
,
softly
approached
the
low
*NL*
porch
,
and
raised
the
latch
.
The
door
yielded
to
the
pressure
,
and
*NL*
they
passed
in
together
.

CHAPTER
XXII
*NL*
*NL*
THE
BURGLARY
*NL*
*NL*
`
Hallo
!
'
cried
a
loud
,
hoarse
voice
,
as
soon
as
they
set
foot
in
the
*NL*
passage
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Do
n't
make
such
a
row
,
'
said
Sikes
,
bolting
the
door
.
`
Show
a
glim

*NL*
Toby
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Aha

cried
the
same
voice
.
'
A
glim

Barney

gentleman

The
speaker
appeared
to
throw
a
boot-jack
,
or
some
such
article
,
at
the
*NL*
person
he
addressed
,
to
rouse
him
from
his
slumbers
:
for
the
noise
of
*NL*
a
wooden
body
,
falling
violently
,
was
heard
;
and
then
an
indistinct
*NL*
muttering
,
as
of
a
man
between
sleep
and
awake
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Do
you
hear
?
'
cried
the
same
voice
.
`
There
's
Bill
Sikes
in
the
*NL*
passage
with
nobody
to
do
the
civil
to
him
;
and
you
sleeping
there
,
as
*NL*
if
you
took
laudanum
with
your
meals
,
and
nothing
stronger
.
Are
you
*NL*
any
fresher
now
,
or
do
you
want
the
iron
candlestick
to
wake
you
*NL*
thoroughly
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
A
pair
of
slipshod
feet
shuffled
,
hastily
,
across
the
bare
floor
of
the
*NL*
room
,
as
this
interrogatory
was
put
;
and
there
issued
,
from
a
door
on
*NL*
the
right
hand
;
first
,
a
feeble
candle
:
and
next
,
the
form
of
the
same
*NL*
individual
who
has
been
heretofore
described
as
labouring
under
the
*NL*
infirmity
of
speaking
through
his
nose
,
and
officiating
as
waiter
at
*NL*
the
public-house
on
Saffron
Hill
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Bister
Sikes
!
'
exclaimed
Barney
,
with
real
or
counterfeit
joy
;
`
cub
*NL*
id
,
sir
;
cub
id
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Here
!
you
get
on
first
,
'
said
Sikes
,
putting
Oliver
in
front
of
him
.
*NL*
`
Quicker
!
or
I
shall
tread
upon
your
heels
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Muttering
a
curse
upon
his
tardiness
,
Sikes
pushed
Oliver
before
him
;
*NL*
and
they
entered
a
low
dark
room
with
a
smoky
fire
,
two
or
three
broken
*NL*
chairs
,
a
table
,
and
a
very
old
couch
:
on
which
,
with
his
legs
much
*NL*
higher
than
his
head
,
a
man
was
reposing
at
full
length
,
smoking
a
long
*NL*
clay
pipe
.
He
was
dressed
in
a
smartly-cut
snuff-coloured
coat
,
with
*NL*
large
brass
buttons
;
an
orange
neckerchief
;
a
coarse
,
staring
,
*NL*
shawl-pattern
waistcoat
;
and
drab
breeches
.
Mr.
Crackit
-LRB-
for
he
it
*NL*
was
-RRB-
had
no
very
great
quantity
of
hair
,
either
upon
his
head
or
face
;
*NL*
but
what
he
had
,
was
of
a
reddish
dye
,
and
tortured
into
long
corkscrew
*NL*
curls
,
through
which
he
occasionally
thrust
some
very
dirty
fingers
,
*NL*
ornamented
with
large
common
rings
.
He
was
a
trifle
above
the
middle
*NL*
size
,
and
apparently
rather
weak
in
the
legs
;
but
this
circumstance
by
*NL*
no
means
detracted
from
his
own
admiration
of
his
top-boots
,
which
he
*NL*
contemplated
,
in
their
elevated
situation
,
with
lively
satisfaction
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Bill
,
my
boy
!
'
said
this
figure
,
turning
his
head
towards
the
door
,
*NL*
`
I
'm
glad
to
see
you
.
I
was
almost
afraid
you
'd
given
it
up
:
in
which
*NL*
case
I
should
have
made
a
personal
wentur
.
Hallo
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Uttering
this
exclamation
in
a
tone
of
great
surprise
,
as
his
eyes
*NL*
rested
on
Oliver
,
Mr.
Toby
Crackit
brought
himself
into
a
sitting
*NL*
posture
,
and
demanded
who
that
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
boy
.
Only
the
boy
!
'
replied
Sikes
,
drawing
a
chair
towards
the
*NL*
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Wud
of
Bister
Fagid
's
lads
,
'
exclaimed
Barney
,
with
a
grin
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Fagin
's
,
eh
!
'
exclaimed
Toby
,
looking
at
Oliver
.
`
Wot
an
inwalable
*NL*
boy
that
'll
make
,
for
the
old
ladies
'
pockets
in
chapels
!
His
mug
is
a
*NL*
fortin
'
to
him
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
There
--
there
's
enough
of
that
,
'
interposed
Sikes
,
impatiently
;
and
*NL*
stooping
over
his
recumbant
friend
,
he
whispered
a
few
words
in
his
*NL*
ear
:
at
which
Mr.
Crackit
laughed
immensely
,
and
honoured
Oliver
with
*NL*
a
long
stare
of
astonishment
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Now
,
'
said
Sikes
,
as
he
resumed
his
seat
,
`
if
you
'll
give
us
something
*NL*
to
eat
and
drink
while
we
're
waiting
,
you
'll
put
some
heart
in
us
;
or
*NL*
in
me
,
at
all
events
.
Sit
down
by
the
fire
,
younker
,
and
rest
*NL*
yourself
;
for
you
'll
have
to
go
out
with
us
again
to-night
,
though
not
*NL*
very
far
off
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Oliver
looked
at
Sikes
,
in
mute
and
timid
wonder
;
and
drawing
a
stool
*NL*
to
the
fire
,
sat
with
his
aching
head
upon
his
hands
,
scarecely
knowing
*NL*
where
he
was
,
or
what
was
passing
around
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Here
,
'
said
Toby
,
as
the
young
Jew
placed
some
fragments
of
food
,
and
*NL*
a
bottle
upon
the
table
,
`
Success
to
the
crack
!
'
He
rose
to
honour
*NL*
the
toast
;
and
,
carefully
depositing
his
empty
pipe
in
a
corner
,
*NL*
advanced
to
the
table
,
filled
a
glass
with
spirits
,
and
drank
off
its
*NL*
contents
.
Mr.
Sikes
did
the
same
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
A
drain
for
the
boy
,
'
said
Toby
,
half-filling
a
wine-glass
.
`
Down
with
*NL*
it
,
innocence
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Indeed
,
'
said
Oliver
,
looking
piteously
up
into
the
man
's
face
;
*NL*
`
indeed
,
I
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Down
with
it
!
'
echoed
Toby
.
`
Do
you
think
I
do
n't
know
what
's
good
*NL*
for
you
?
Tell
him
to
drink
it
,
Bill
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
had
better
!
'
said
Sikes
clapping
his
hand
upon
his
pocket
.
`
Burn
my
*NL*
body
,
if
he
is
n't
more
trouble
than
a
whole
family
of
Dodgers
.
Drink
*NL*
it
,
you
perwerse
imp
;
drink
it
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Frightened
by
the
menacing
gestures
of
the
two
men
,
Oliver
hastily
*NL*
swallowed
the
contents
of
the
glass
,
and
immediately
fell
into
a
*NL*
violent
fit
of
coughing
:
which
delighted
Toby
Crackit
and
Barney
,
and
*NL*
even
drew
a
smile
from
the
surly
Mr.
Sikes
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
done
,
and
Sikes
having
satisfied
his
appetite
-LRB-
Oliver
could
eat
*NL*
nothing
but
a
small
crust
of
bread
which
they
made
him
swallow
-RRB-
,
the
*NL*
two
men
laid
themselves
down
on
chairs
for
a
short
nap
.
Oliver
*NL*
retained
his
stool
by
the
fire
;
Barney
wrapped
in
a
blanket
,
stretched
*NL*
himself
on
the
floor
:
close
outside
the
fender
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
slept
,
or
appeared
to
sleep
,
for
some
time
;
nobody
stirring
but
*NL*
Barney
,
who
rose
once
or
twice
to
throw
coals
on
the
fire
.
Oliver
fell
*NL*
into
a
heavy
doze
:
imagining
himself
straying
along
the
gloomy
lanes
,
*NL*
or
wandering
about
the
dark
churchyard
,
or
retracing
some
one
or
other
*NL*
of
the
scenes
of
the
past
day
:
when
he
was
roused
by
Toby
Crackit
*NL*
jumping
up
and
declaring
it
was
half-past
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
an
instant
,
the
other
two
were
on
their
legs
,
and
all
were
actively
*NL*
engaged
in
busy
preparation
.
Sikes
and
his
companion
enveloped
their
*NL*
necks
and
chins
in
large
dark
shawls
,
and
drew
on
their
great-coats
;
*NL*
Barney
,
opening
a
cupboard
,
brought
forth
several
articles
,
which
he
*NL*
hastily
crammed
into
the
pockets
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Barkers
for
me
,
Barney
,
'
said
Toby
Crackit
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Here
they
are
,
'
replied
Barney
,
producing
a
pair
of
pistols
.
`
You
*NL*
loaded
them
yourself
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
All
right
!
'
replied
Toby
,
stowing
them
away
.
`
The
persuaders
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
've
got
'em
,
'
replied
Sikes
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Crape
,
keys
,
centre-bits
,
darkies
--
nothing
forgotten
?
'
inquired
Toby
:
*NL*
fastening
a
small
crowbar
to
a
loop
inside
the
skirt
of
his
coat
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
All
right
,
'
rejoined
his
companion
.
`
Bring
them
bits
of
timber
,
*NL*
Barney
.
That
's
the
time
of
day
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
With
these
words
,
he
took
a
thick
stick
from
Barney
's
hands
,
who
,
*NL*
having
delivered
another
to
Toby
,
busied
himself
in
fastening
on
*NL*
Oliver
's
cape
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Now
then
!
'
said
Sikes
,
holding
out
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oliver
:
who
was
completely
stupified
by
the
unwonted
exercise
,
and
the
*NL*
air
,
and
the
drink
which
had
been
forced
upon
him
:
put
his
hand
*NL*
mechanically
into
that
which
Sikes
extended
for
the
purpose
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Take
his
other
hand
,
Toby
,
'
said
Sikes
.
`
Look
out
,
Barney
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
went
to
the
door
,
and
returned
to
announce
that
all
was
quiet
.
*NL*
The
two
robbers
issued
forth
with
Oliver
between
them
.
Barney
,
having
*NL*
made
all
fast
,
rolled
himself
up
as
before
,
and
was
soon
asleep
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
now
intensely
dark
.
The
fog
was
much
heavier
than
it
had
been
*NL*
in
the
early
part
of
the
night
;
and
the
atmosphere
was
so
damp
,
that
,
*NL*
although
no
rain
fell
,
Oliver
's
hair
and
eyebrows
,
within
a
few
minutes
*NL*
after
leaving
the
house
,
had
become
stiff
with
the
half-frozen
moisture
*NL*
that
was
floating
about
.
They
crossed
the
bridge
,
and
kept
on
towards
*NL*
the
lights
which
he
had
seen
before
.
They
were
at
no
great
distance
*NL*
off
;
and
,
as
they
walked
pretty
briskly
,
they
soon
arrived
at
Chertsey
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Slap
through
the
town
,
'
whispered
Sikes
;
`
there
'll
be
nobody
in
the
*NL*
way
,
to-night
,
to
see
us
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Toby
acquiesced
;
and
they
hurried
through
the
main
street
of
the
little
*NL*
town
,
which
at
that
late
hour
was
wholly
deserted
.
A
dim
light
shone
*NL*
at
intervals
from
some
bed-room
window
;
and
the
hoarse
barking
of
dogs
*NL*
occasionally
broke
the
silence
of
the
night
.
But
there
was
nobody
*NL*
abroad
.
They
had
cleared
the
town
,
as
the
church-bell
struck
two
.
*NL*
*NL*
Quickening
their
pace
,
they
turned
up
a
road
upon
the
left
hand
.
After
*NL*
walking
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
,
they
stopped
before
a
detached
house
*NL*
surrounded
by
a
wall
:
to
the
top
of
which
,
Toby
Crackit
,
scarcely
*NL*
pausing
to
take
breath
,
climbed
in
a
twinkling
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
boy
next
,
'
said
Toby
.
`
Hoist
him
up
;
I
'll
catch
hold
of
him
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Before
Oliver
had
time
to
look
round
,
Sikes
had
caught
him
under
the
*NL*
arms
;
and
in
three
or
four
seconds
he
and
Toby
were
lying
on
the
grass
*NL*
on
the
other
side
.
Sikes
followed
directly
.
And
they
stole
cautiously
*NL*
towards
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
,
for
the
first
time
,
Oliver
,
well-nigh
mad
with
grief
and
*NL*
terror
,
saw
that
housebreaking
and
robbery
,
if
not
murder
,
were
the
*NL*
objects
of
the
expedition
.
He
clasped
his
hands
together
,
and
*NL*
involuntarily
uttered
a
subdued
exclamation
of
horror
.
A
mist
came
*NL*
before
his
eyes
;
the
cold
sweat
stood
upon
his
ashy
face
;
his
limbs
*NL*
failed
him
;
and
he
sank
upon
his
knees
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Get
up
!
'
murmured
Sikes
,
trembling
with
rage
,
and
drawing
the
pistol
*NL*
from
his
pocket
;
`
Get
up
,
or
I
'll
strew
your
brains
upon
the
grass
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
!
for
God
's
sake
let
me
go
!
'
cried
Oliver
;
`
let
me
run
away
and
die
*NL*
in
the
fields
.
I
will
never
come
near
London
;
never
,
never
!
Oh
!
pray
*NL*
have
mercy
on
me
,
and
do
not
make
me
steal
.
For
the
love
of
all
the
*NL*
bright
Angels
that
rest
in
Heaven
,
have
mercy
upon
me
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
to
whom
this
appeal
was
made
,
swore
a
dreadful
oath
,
and
had
*NL*
cocked
the
pistol
,
when
Toby
,
striking
it
from
his
grasp
,
placed
his
*NL*
hand
upon
the
boy
's
mouth
,
and
dragged
him
to
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Hush
!
'
cried
the
man
;
`
it
wo
n't
answer
here
.
Say
another
word
,
and
*NL*
I
'll
do
your
business
myself
with
a
crack
on
the
head
.
That
makes
no
*NL*
noise
,
and
is
quite
as
certain
,
and
more
genteel
.
Here
,
Bill
,
wrench
*NL*
the
shutter
open
.
He
's
game
enough
now
,
I
'll
engage
.
I
've
seen
older
*NL*
hands
of
his
age
took
the
same
way
,
for
a
minute
or
two
,
on
a
cold
*NL*
night
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Sikes
,
invoking
terrific
imprecations
upon
Fagin
's
head
for
sending
*NL*
Oliver
on
such
an
errand
,
plied
the
crowbar
vigorously
,
but
with
little
*NL*
noise
.
After
some
delay
,
and
some
assistance
from
Toby
,
the
shutter
to
*NL*
which
he
had
referred
,
swung
open
on
its
hinges
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
little
lattice
window
,
about
five
feet
and
a
half
above
the
*NL*
ground
,
at
the
back
of
the
house
:
which
belonged
to
a
scullery
,
or
*NL*
small
brewing-place
,
at
the
end
of
the
passage
.
The
aperture
was
so
*NL*
small
,
that
the
inmates
had
probably
not
thought
it
worth
while
to
*NL*
defend
it
more
securely
;
but
it
was
large
enough
to
admit
a
boy
of
*NL*
Oliver
's
size
,
nevertheless
.
A
very
brief
exercise
of
Mr.
Sike
's
art
,
*NL*
sufficed
to
overcome
the
fastening
of
the
lattice
;
and
it
soon
stood
*NL*
wide
open
also
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Now
listen
,
you
young
limb
,
'
whispered
Sikes
,
drawing
a
dark
lantern
*NL*
from
his
pocket
,
and
throwing
the
glare
full
on
Oliver
's
face
;
`
I
'm
a
*NL*
going
to
put
you
through
there
.
Take
this
light
;
go
softly
up
the
*NL*
steps
straight
afore
you
,
and
along
the
little
hall
,
to
the
street
*NL*
door
;
unfasten
it
,
and
let
us
in
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
There
's
a
bolt
at
the
top
,
you
wo
n't
be
able
to
reach
,
'
interposed
*NL*
Toby
.
`
Stand
upon
one
of
the
hall
chairs
.
There
are
three
there
,
Bill
,
*NL*
with
a
jolly
large
blue
unicorn
and
gold
pitchfork
on
'em
:
which
is
*NL*
the
old
lady
's
arms
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Keep
quiet
,
ca
n't
you
?
'
replied
Sikes
,
with
a
threatening
look
.
`
The
*NL*
room-door
is
open
,
is
it
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Wide
,
'
replied
Toby
,
after
peeping
in
to
satisfy
himself
.
`
The
game
of
*NL*
that
is
,
that
they
always
leave
it
open
with
a
catch
,
so
that
the
dog
,
*NL*
who
's
got
a
bed
in
here
,
may
walk
up
and
down
the
passage
when
he
feels
*NL*
wakeful
.
Ha
!
ha
!
Barney
`
ticed
him
away
to-night
.
So
neat
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Although
Mr.
Crackit
spoke
in
a
scarcely
audible
whisper
,
and
laughed
*NL*
without
noise
,
Sikes
imperiously
commanded
him
to
be
silent
,
and
to
get
*NL*
to
work
.
Toby
complied
,
by
first
producing
his
lantern
,
and
placing
it
*NL*
on
the
ground
;
then
by
planting
himself
firmly
with
his
head
against
*NL*
the
wall
beneath
the
window
,
and
his
hands
upon
his
knees
,
so
as
to
*NL*
make
a
step
of
his
back
.
This
was
no
sooner
done
,
than
Sikes
,
mounting
*NL*
upon
him
,
put
Oliver
gently
through
the
window
with
his
feet
first
;
*NL*
and
,
without
leaving
hold
of
his
collar
,
planted
him
safely
on
the
*NL*
floor
inside
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Take
this
lantern
,
'
said
Sikes
,
looking
into
the
room
.
`
You
see
the
*NL*
stairs
afore
you
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
Oliver
,
more
dead
than
alive
,
gasped
out
,
`
Yes
.
'
Sikes
,
pointing
to
*NL*
the
street-door
with
the
pistol-barrel
,
briefly
advised
him
to
take
*NL*
notice
that
he
was
within
shot
all
the
way
;
and
that
if
he
faltered
,
he
*NL*
would
fall
dead
that
instant
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
's
done
in
a
minute
,
'
said
Sikes
,
in
the
same
low
whisper
.
`
Directly
*NL*
I
leave
go
of
you
,
do
your
work
.
Hark
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
's
that
?
'
whispered
the
other
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
listened
intently
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Nothing
,
'
said
Sikes
,
releasing
his
hold
of
Oliver
.
`
Now
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
short
time
he
had
had
to
collect
his
senses
,
the
boy
had
firmly
*NL*
resolved
that
,
whether
he
died
in
the
attempt
or
not
,
he
would
make
one
*NL*
effort
to
dart
upstairs
from
the
hall
,
and
alarm
the
family
.
Filled
*NL*
with
this
idea
,
he
advanced
at
once
,
but
stealthily
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Come
back
!
'
suddenly
cried
Sikes
aloud
.
`
Back
!
back
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Scared
by
the
sudden
breaking
of
the
dead
stillness
of
the
place
,
and
*NL*
by
a
loud
cry
which
followed
it
,
Oliver
let
his
lantern
fall
,
and
knew
*NL*
not
whether
to
advance
or
fly
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cry
was
repeated
--
a
light
appeared
--
a
vision
of
two
terrified
*NL*
half-dressed
men
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
swam
before
his
eyes
--
a
*NL*
flash
--
a
loud
noise
--
a
smoke
--
a
crash
somewhere
,
but
where
he
knew
*NL*
not
,
--
and
he
staggered
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sikes
had
disappeared
for
an
instant
;
but
he
was
up
again
,
and
had
him
*NL*
by
the
collar
before
the
smoke
had
cleared
away
.
He
fired
his
own
*NL*
pistol
after
the
men
,
who
were
already
retreating
;
and
dragged
the
boy
*NL*
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Clasp
your
arm
tighter
,
'
said
Sikes
,
as
he
drew
him
through
the
*NL*
window
.
`
Give
me
a
shawl
here
.
They
've
hit
him
.
Quick
!
How
the
boy
*NL*
bleeds
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Then
came
the
loud
ringing
of
a
bell
,
mingled
with
the
noise
of
*NL*
fire-arms
,
and
the
shouts
of
men
,
and
the
sensation
of
being
carried
*NL*
over
uneven
ground
at
a
rapid
pace
.
And
then
,
the
noises
grew
confused
*NL*
in
the
distance
;
and
a
cold
deadly
feeling
crept
over
the
boy
's
heart
;
*NL*
and
he
saw
or
heard
no
more
.

CHAPTER
XXIII
*NL*
*NL*
WHICH
CONTAINS
THE
SUBSTANCE
OF
A
PLEASANT
CONVERSATION
BETWEEN
MR.
*NL*
BUMBLE
AND
A
LADY
;
AND
SHOWS
THAT
EVEN
A
BEADLE
MAY
BE
SUSCEPTIBLE
ON
*NL*
SOME
POINTS
*NL*
*NL*
The
night
was
bitter
cold
.
The
snow
lay
on
the
ground
,
frozen
into
a
*NL*
hard
thick
crust
,
so
that
only
the
heaps
that
had
drifted
into
byways
*NL*
and
corners
were
affected
by
the
sharp
wind
that
howled
abroad
:
which
,
*NL*
as
if
expending
increased
fury
on
such
prey
as
it
found
,
caught
it
*NL*
savagely
up
in
clouds
,
and
,
whirling
it
into
a
thousand
misty
eddies
,
*NL*
scattered
it
in
air
.
Bleak
,
dark
,
and
piercing
cold
,
it
was
a
night
*NL*
for
the
well-housed
and
fed
to
draw
round
the
bright
fire
and
thank
God
*NL*
they
were
at
home
;
and
for
the
homeless
,
starving
wretch
to
lay
him
*NL*
down
and
die
.
Many
hunger-worn
outcasts
close
their
eyes
in
our
bare
*NL*
streets
,
at
such
times
,
who
,
let
their
crimes
have
been
what
they
may
,
*NL*
can
hardly
open
them
in
a
more
bitter
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
was
the
aspect
of
out-of-doors
affairs
,
when
Mrs.
Corney
,
the
*NL*
matron
of
the
workhouse
to
which
our
readers
have
been
already
*NL*
introduced
as
the
birthplace
of
Oliver
Twist
,
sat
herself
down
before
a
*NL*
cheerful
fire
in
her
own
little
room
,
and
glanced
,
with
no
small
degree
*NL*
of
complacency
,
at
a
small
round
table
:
on
which
stood
a
tray
of
*NL*
corresponding
size
,
furnished
with
all
necessary
materials
for
the
most
*NL*
grateful
meal
that
matrons
enjoy
.
In
fact
,
Mrs.
Corney
was
about
to
*NL*
solace
herself
with
a
cup
of
tea
.
As
she
glanced
from
the
table
to
the
*NL*
fireplace
,
where
the
smallest
of
all
possible
kettles
was
singing
a
*NL*
small
song
in
a
small
voice
,
her
inward
satisfaction
evidently
*NL*
increased
,
--
so
much
so
,
indeed
,
that
Mrs.
Corney
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
!
'
said
the
matron
,
leaning
her
elbow
on
the
table
,
and
looking
*NL*
reflectively
at
the
fire
;
`
I
'm
sure
we
have
all
on
us
a
great
deal
to
*NL*
be
grateful
for
!
A
great
deal
,
if
we
did
but
know
it
.
Ah
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Corney
shook
her
head
mournfully
,
as
if
deploring
the
mental
*NL*
blindness
of
those
paupers
who
did
not
know
it
;
and
thrusting
a
silver
*NL*
spoon
-LRB-
private
property
-RRB-
into
the
inmost
recesses
of
a
two-ounce
tin
*NL*
tea-caddy
,
proceeded
to
make
the
tea
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
slight
a
thing
will
disturb
the
equanimity
of
our
frail
minds
!
The
*NL*
black
teapot
,
being
very
small
and
easily
filled
,
ran
over
while
Mrs.
*NL*
Corney
was
moralising
;
and
the
water
slightly
scalded
Mrs.
Corney
's
*NL*
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Drat
the
pot
!
'
said
the
worthy
matron
,
setting
it
down
very
hastily
on
*NL*
the
hob
;
'
a
little
stupid
thing
,
that
only
holds
a
couple
of
cups
!
*NL*
What
use
is
it
of
,
to
anybody
!
Except
,
'
said
Mrs.
Corney
,
pausing
,
*NL*
`
except
to
a
poor
desolate
creature
like
me
.
Oh
dear
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
With
these
words
,
the
matron
dropped
into
her
chair
,
and
,
once
more
*NL*
resting
her
elbow
on
the
table
,
thought
of
her
solitary
fate
.
The
*NL*
small
teapot
,
and
the
single
cup
,
had
awakened
in
her
mind
sad
*NL*
recollections
of
Mr.
Corney
-LRB-
who
had
not
been
dead
more
than
*NL*
five-and-twenty
years
-RRB-
;
and
she
was
overpowered
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
shall
never
get
another
!
'
said
Mrs.
Corney
,
pettishly
;
'
I
shall
*NL*
never
get
another
--
like
him
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Whether
this
remark
bore
reference
to
the
husband
,
or
the
teapot
,
is
*NL*
uncertain
.
It
might
have
been
the
latter
;
for
Mrs.
Corney
looked
at
it
*NL*
as
she
spoke
;
and
took
it
up
afterwards
.
She
had
just
tasted
her
first
*NL*
cup
,
when
she
was
disturbed
by
a
soft
tap
at
the
room-door
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
,
come
in
with
you
!
'
said
Mrs.
Corney
,
sharply
.
`
Some
of
the
old
*NL*
women
dying
,
I
suppose
.
They
always
die
when
I
'm
at
meals
.
Do
n't
stand
*NL*
there
,
letting
the
cold
air
in
,
do
n't
.
What
's
amiss
now
,
eh
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Nothing
,
ma'am
,
nothing
,
'
replied
a
man
's
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Dear
me
!
'
exclaimed
the
matron
,
in
a
much
sweeter
tone
,
`
is
that
Mr.
*NL*
Bumble
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
At
your
service
,
ma'am
,
'
said
Mr.
Bumble
,
who
had
been
stopping
*NL*
outside
to
rub
his
shoes
clean
,
and
to
shake
the
snow
off
his
coat
;
and
*NL*
who
now
made
his
appearance
,
bearing
the
cocked
hat
in
one
hand
and
a
*NL*
bundle
in
the
other
.
`
Shall
I
shut
the
door
,
ma'am
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
lady
modestly
hesitated
to
reply
,
lest
there
should
be
any
*NL*
impropriety
in
holding
an
interview
with
Mr.
Bumble
,
with
closed
doors
.
*NL*
Mr.
Bumble
taking
advantage
of
the
hesitation
,
and
being
very
cold
*NL*
himself
,
shut
it
without
permission
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Hard
weather
,
Mr.
Bumble
,
'
said
the
matron
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Hard
,
indeed
,
ma'am
,
'
replied
the
beadle
.
`
Anti-porochial
weather
*NL*
this
,
ma'am
.
We
have
given
away
,
Mrs.
Corney
,
we
have
given
away
a
*NL*
matter
of
twenty
quartern
loaves
and
a
cheese
and
a
half
,
this
very
*NL*
blessed
afternoon
;
and
yet
them
paupers
are
not
contented
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Of
course
not
.
When
would
they
be
,
Mr.
Bumble
?
'
said
the
matron
,
*NL*
sipping
her
tea
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
When
,
indeed
,
ma'am
!
'
rejoined
Mr.
Bumble
.
`
Why
here
's
one
man
that
,
*NL*
in
consideration
of
his
wife
and
large
family
,
has
a
quartern
loaf
and
*NL*
a
good
pound
of
cheese
,
full
weight
.
Is
he
grateful
,
ma'am
?
Is
he
*NL*
grateful
?
Not
a
copper
farthing
's
worth
of
it
!
What
does
he
do
,
*NL*
ma'am
,
but
ask
for
a
few
coals
;
if
it
's
only
a
pocket
handkerchief
*NL*
full
,
he
says
!
Coals
!
What
would
he
do
with
coals
?
Toast
his
cheese
*NL*
with
'em
and
then
come
back
for
more
.
That
's
the
way
with
these
*NL*
people
,
ma'am
;
give
'em
a
apron
full
of
coals
to-day
,
and
they
'll
come
*NL*
back
for
another
,
the
day
after
to-morrow
,
as
brazen
as
alabaster
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
matron
expressed
her
entire
concurrence
in
this
intelligible
*NL*
simile
;
and
the
beadle
went
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
never
,
'
said
Mr.
Bumble
,
`
see
anything
like
the
pitch
it
's
got
to
.
*NL*
The
day
afore
yesterday
,
a
man
--
you
have
been
a
married
woman
,
ma'am
,
*NL*
and
I
may
mention
it
to
you
--
a
man
,
with
hardly
a
rag
upon
his
back
*NL*
-LRB-
here
Mrs.
Corney
looked
at
the
floor
-RRB-
,
goes
to
our
overseer
's
door
*NL*
when
he
has
got
company
coming
to
dinner
;
and
says
,
he
must
be
*NL*
relieved
,
Mrs.
Corney
.
As
he
would
n't
go
away
,
and
shocked
the
company
*NL*
very
much
,
our
overseer
sent
him
out
a
pound
of
potatoes
and
half
a
*NL*
pint
of
oatmeal
.
``
My
heart
!
''
says
the
ungrateful
villain
,
``
what
's
the
*NL*
use
of
_
this
_
to
me
?
You
might
as
well
give
me
a
pair
of
iron
*NL*
spectacles
!
''
``
Very
good
,
''
says
our
overseer
,
taking
'em
away
again
,
*NL*
``
you
wo
n't
get
anything
else
here
.
''
``
Then
I
'll
die
in
the
streets
!
''
*NL*
says
the
vagrant
.
``
Oh
no
,
you
wo
n't
,
''
says
our
overseer
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ha
!
ha
!
That
was
very
good
!
So
like
Mr.
Grannett
,
was
n't
it
?
'
*NL*
interposed
the
matron
.
`
Well
,
Mr.
Bumble
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
ma'am
,
'
rejoined
the
beadle
,
`
he
went
away
;
and
he
_
did
_
die
in
*NL*
the
streets
.
There
's
a
obstinate
pauper
for
you
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
beats
anything
I
could
have
believed
,
'
observed
the
matron
*NL*
emphatically
.
`
But
do
n't
you
think
out-of-door
relief
a
very
bad
*NL*
thing
,
any
way
,
Mr.
Bumble
?
You
're
a
gentleman
of
experience
,
and
*NL*
ought
to
know
.
Come
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Mrs.
Corney
,
'
said
the
beadle
,
smiling
as
men
smile
who
are
conscious
*NL*
of
superior
information
,
`
out-of-door
relief
,
properly
managed
:
*NL*
properly
managed
,
ma'am
:
is
the
porochial
safeguard
.
The
great
*NL*
principle
of
out-of-door
relief
is
,
to
give
the
paupers
exactly
what
*NL*
they
do
n't
want
;
and
then
they
get
tired
of
coming
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Dear
me
!
'
exclaimed
Mrs.
Corney
.
`
Well
,
that
is
a
good
one
,
too
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
.
Betwixt
you
and
me
,
ma'am
,
'
returned
Mr.
Bumble
,
`
that
's
the
*NL*
great
principle
;
and
that
's
the
reason
why
,
if
you
look
at
any
cases
*NL*
that
get
into
them
owdacious
newspapers
,
you
'll
always
observe
that
*NL*
sick
families
have
been
relieved
with
slices
of
cheese
.
That
's
the
*NL*
rule
now
,
Mrs.
Corney
,
all
over
the
country
.
But
,
however
,
'
said
the
*NL*
beadle
,
stopping
to
unpack
his
bundle
,
`
these
are
official
secrets
,
*NL*
ma'am
;
not
to
be
spoken
of
;
except
,
as
I
may
say
,
among
the
porochial
*NL*
officers
,
such
as
ourselves
.
This
is
the
port
wine
,
ma'am
,
that
the
*NL*
board
ordered
for
the
infirmary
;
real
,
fresh
,
genuine
port
wine
;
only
*NL*
out
of
the
cask
this
forenoon
;
clear
as
a
bell
,
and
no
sediment
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Having
held
the
first
bottle
up
to
the
light
,
and
shaken
it
well
to
*NL*
test
its
excellence
,
Mr.
Bumble
placed
them
both
on
top
of
a
chest
of
*NL*
drawers
;
folded
the
handkerchief
in
which
they
had
been
wrapped
;
put
it
*NL*
carefully
in
his
pocket
;
and
took
up
his
hat
,
as
if
to
go
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
'll
have
a
very
cold
walk
,
Mr.
Bumble
,
'
said
the
matron
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
blows
,
ma'am
,
'
replied
Mr.
Bumble
,
turning
up
his
coat-collar
,
*NL*
`
enough
to
cut
one
's
ears
off
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
matron
looked
,
from
the
little
kettle
,
to
the
beadle
,
who
was
*NL*
moving
towards
the
door
;
and
as
the
beadle
coughed
,
preparatory
to
*NL*
bidding
her
good-night
,
bashfully
inquired
whether
--
whether
he
would
n't
*NL*
take
a
cup
of
tea
?
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bumble
instantaneously
turned
back
his
collar
again
;
laid
his
hat
*NL*
and
stick
upon
a
chair
;
and
drew
another
chair
up
to
the
table
.
As
he
*NL*
slowly
seated
himself
,
he
looked
at
the
lady
.
She
fixed
her
eyes
upon
*NL*
the
little
teapot
.
Mr.
Bumble
coughed
again
,
and
slightly
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Corney
rose
to
get
another
cup
and
saucer
from
the
closet
.
As
she
*NL*
sat
down
,
her
eyes
once
again
encountered
those
of
the
gallant
beadle
;
*NL*
she
coloured
,
and
applied
herself
to
the
task
of
making
his
tea
.
Again
*NL*
Mr.
Bumble
coughed
--
louder
this
time
than
he
had
coughed
yet
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Sweet
?
Mr.
Bumble
?
'
inquired
the
matron
,
taking
up
the
sugar-basin
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Very
sweet
,
indeed
,
ma'am
,
'
replied
Mr.
Bumble
.
He
fixed
his
eyes
on
*NL*
Mrs.
Corney
as
he
said
this
;
and
if
ever
a
beadle
looked
tender
,
Mr.
*NL*
Bumble
was
that
beadle
at
that
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
tea
was
made
,
and
handed
in
silence
.
Mr.
Bumble
,
having
spread
a
*NL*
handkerchief
over
his
knees
to
prevent
the
crumbs
from
sullying
the
*NL*
splendour
of
his
shorts
,
began
to
eat
and
drink
;
varying
these
*NL*
amusements
,
occasionally
,
by
fetching
a
deep
sigh
;
which
,
however
,
had
*NL*
no
injurious
effect
upon
his
appetite
,
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
rather
*NL*
seemed
to
facilitate
his
operations
in
the
tea
and
toast
department
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
have
a
cat
,
ma'am
,
I
see
,
'
said
Mr.
Bumble
,
glancing
at
one
who
,
*NL*
in
the
centre
of
her
family
,
was
basking
before
the
fire
;
`
and
kittens
*NL*
too
,
I
declare
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
am
so
fond
of
them
,
Mr.
Bumble
,
you
ca
n't
think
,
'
replied
the
*NL*
matron
.
`
They
're
_
so
_
happy
,
_
so
_
frolicsome
,
and
_
so
_
cheerful
,
that
*NL*
they
are
quite
companions
for
me
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Very
nice
animals
,
ma'am
,
'
replied
Mr.
Bumble
,
approvingly
;
`
so
very
*NL*
domestic
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
,
yes
!
'
rejoined
the
matron
with
enthusiasm
;
`
so
fond
of
their
home
*NL*
too
,
that
it
's
quite
a
pleasure
,
I
'm
sure
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Mrs.
Corney
,
ma'am
,
'
said
Mr.
Bumble
,
slowly
,
and
marking
the
time
*NL*
with
his
teaspoon
,
'
I
mean
to
say
this
,
ma'am
;
that
any
cat
,
or
kitten
,
*NL*
that
could
live
with
you
,
ma'am
,
and
_
not
_
be
fond
of
its
home
,
must
be
*NL*
a
ass
,
ma'am
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
,
Mr.
Bumble
!
'
remonstrated
Mrs.
Corney
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
's
of
no
use
disguising
facts
,
ma'am
,
'
said
Mr.
Bumble
,
slowly
*NL*
flourishing
the
teaspoon
with
a
kind
of
amorous
dignity
which
made
him
*NL*
doubly
impressive
;
'
I
would
drown
it
myself
,
with
pleasure
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Then
you
're
a
cruel
man
,
'
said
the
matron
vivaciously
,
as
she
held
out
*NL*
her
hand
for
the
beadle
's
cup
;
`
and
a
very
hard-hearted
man
besides
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Hard-hearted
,
ma'am
?
'
said
Mr.
Bumble
.
`
Hard
?
'
Mr.
Bumble
resigned
*NL*
his
cup
without
another
word
;
squeezed
Mrs.
Corney
's
little
finger
as
*NL*
she
took
it
;
and
inflicting
two
open-handed
slaps
upon
his
laced
*NL*
waistcoat
,
gave
a
mighty
sigh
,
and
hitched
his
chair
a
very
little
*NL*
morsel
farther
from
the
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
round
table
;
and
as
Mrs.
Corney
and
Mr.
Bumble
had
been
*NL*
sitting
opposite
each
other
,
with
no
great
space
between
them
,
and
*NL*
fronting
the
fire
,
it
will
be
seen
that
Mr.
Bumble
,
in
receding
from
*NL*
the
fire
,
and
still
keeping
at
the
table
,
increased
the
distance
*NL*
between
himself
and
Mrs.
Corney
;
which
proceeding
,
some
prudent
readers
*NL*
will
doubtless
be
disposed
to
admire
,
and
to
consider
an
act
of
great
*NL*
heroism
on
Mr.
Bumble
's
part
:
he
being
in
some
sort
tempted
by
time
,
*NL*
place
,
and
opportunity
,
to
give
utterance
to
certain
soft
nothings
,
*NL*
which
however
well
they
may
become
the
lips
of
the
light
and
*NL*
thoughtless
,
do
seem
immeasurably
beneath
the
dignity
of
judges
of
the
*NL*
land
,
members
of
parliament
,
ministers
of
state
,
lord
mayors
,
and
other
*NL*
great
public
functionaries
,
but
more
particularly
beneath
the
*NL*
stateliness
and
gravity
of
a
beadle
:
who
-LRB-
as
is
well
known
-RRB-
should
be
*NL*
the
sternest
and
most
inflexible
among
them
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whatever
were
Mr.
Bumble
's
intentions
,
however
-LRB-
and
no
doubt
they
were
*NL*
of
the
best
-RRB-
:
it
unfortunately
happened
,
as
has
been
twice
before
*NL*
remarked
,
that
the
table
was
a
round
one
;
consequently
Mr.
Bumble
,
*NL*
moving
his
chair
by
little
and
little
,
soon
began
to
diminish
the
*NL*
distance
between
himself
and
the
matron
;
and
,
continuing
to
travel
*NL*
round
the
outer
edge
of
the
circle
,
brought
his
chair
,
in
time
,
close
*NL*
to
that
in
which
the
matron
was
seated
.
*NL*
*NL*
Indeed
,
the
two
chairs
touched
;
and
when
they
did
so
,
Mr.
Bumble
*NL*
stopped
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
if
the
matron
had
moved
her
chair
to
the
right
,
she
would
have
*NL*
been
scorched
by
the
fire
;
and
if
to
the
left
,
she
must
have
fallen
*NL*
into
Mr.
Bumble
's
arms
;
so
-LRB-
being
a
discreet
matron
,
and
no
doubt
*NL*
foreseeing
these
consequences
at
a
glance
-RRB-
she
remained
where
she
was
,
*NL*
and
handed
Mr.
Bumble
another
cup
of
tea
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Hard-hearted
,
Mrs.
Corney
?
'
said
Mr.
Bumble
,
stirring
his
tea
,
and
*NL*
looking
up
into
the
matron
's
face
;
`
are
_
you
_
hard-hearted
,
Mrs.
*NL*
Corney
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Dear
me
!
'
exclaimed
the
matron
,
`
what
a
very
curious
question
from
a
*NL*
single
man
.
What
can
you
want
to
know
for
,
Mr.
Bumble
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
beadle
drank
his
tea
to
the
last
drop
;
finished
a
piece
of
toast
;
*NL*
whisked
the
crumbs
off
his
knees
;
wiped
his
lips
;
and
deliberately
*NL*
kissed
the
matron
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Mr.
Bumble
!
'
cried
that
discreet
lady
in
a
whisper
;
for
the
fright
was
*NL*
so
great
,
that
she
had
quite
lost
her
voice
,
`
Mr.
Bumble
,
I
shall
*NL*
scream
!
'
Mr.
Bumble
made
no
reply
;
but
in
a
slow
and
dignified
manner
,
*NL*
put
his
arm
round
the
matron
's
waist
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
lady
had
stated
her
intention
of
screaming
,
of
course
she
would
*NL*
have
screamed
at
this
additional
boldness
,
but
that
the
exertion
was
*NL*
rendered
unnecessary
by
a
hasty
knocking
at
the
door
:
which
was
no
*NL*
sooner
heard
,
than
Mr.
Bumble
darted
,
with
much
agility
,
to
the
wine
*NL*
bottles
,
and
began
dusting
them
with
great
violence
:
while
the
matron
*NL*
sharply
demanded
who
was
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
worthy
of
remark
,
as
a
curious
physical
instance
of
the
efficacy
*NL*
of
a
sudden
surprise
in
counteracting
the
effects
of
extreme
fear
,
that
*NL*
her
voice
had
quite
recovered
all
its
official
asperity
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
If
you
please
,
mistress
,
'
said
a
withered
old
female
pauper
,
hideously
*NL*
ugly
:
putting
her
head
in
at
the
door
,
`
Old
Sally
is
a-going
fast
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
what
's
that
to
me
?
'
angrily
demanded
the
matron
.
'
I
ca
n't
keep
*NL*
her
alive
,
can
I
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
no
,
mistress
,
'
replied
the
old
woman
,
`
nobody
can
;
she
's
far
*NL*
beyond
the
reach
of
help
.
I
've
seen
a
many
people
die
;
little
babes
*NL*
and
great
strong
men
;
and
I
know
when
death
's
a-coming
,
well
enough
.
*NL*
But
she
's
troubled
in
her
mind
:
and
when
the
fits
are
not
on
her
,
--
and
*NL*
that
's
not
often
,
for
she
is
dying
very
hard
,
--
she
says
she
has
got
*NL*
something
to
tell
,
which
you
must
hear
.
She
'll
never
die
quiet
till
*NL*
you
come
,
mistress
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
intelligence
,
the
worthy
Mrs.
Corney
muttered
a
variety
of
*NL*
invectives
against
old
women
who
could
n't
even
die
without
purposely
*NL*
annoying
their
betters
;
and
,
muffling
herself
in
a
thick
shawl
which
*NL*
she
hastily
caught
up
,
briefly
requested
Mr.
Bumble
to
stay
till
she
*NL*
came
back
,
lest
anything
particular
should
occur
.
Bidding
the
*NL*
messenger
walk
fast
,
and
not
be
all
night
hobbling
up
the
stairs
,
she
*NL*
followed
her
from
the
room
with
a
very
ill
grace
,
scolding
all
the
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bumble
's
conduct
on
being
left
to
himself
,
was
rather
inexplicable
.
*NL*
He
opened
the
closet
,
counted
the
teaspoons
,
weighed
the
sugar-tongs
,
*NL*
closely
inspected
a
silver
milk-pot
to
ascertain
that
it
was
of
the
*NL*
genuine
metal
,
and
,
having
satisfied
his
curiosity
on
these
points
,
put
*NL*
on
his
cocked
hat
corner-wise
,
and
danced
with
much
gravity
four
*NL*
distinct
times
round
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
gone
through
this
very
extraordinary
performance
,
he
took
off
*NL*
the
cocked
hat
again
,
and
,
spreading
himself
before
the
fire
with
his
*NL*
back
towards
it
,
seemed
to
be
mentally
engaged
in
taking
an
exact
*NL*
inventory
of
the
furniture
.

CHAPTER
XXIV
*NL*
*NL*
TREATS
ON
A
VERY
POOR
SUBJECT
.
BUT
IS
A
SHORT
ONE
,
AND
MAY
BE
FOUND
OF
*NL*
IMPORTANCE
IN
THIS
HISTORY
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
no
unfit
messenger
of
death
,
who
had
disturbed
the
quiet
of
the
*NL*
matron
's
room
.
Her
body
was
bent
by
age
;
her
limbs
trembled
with
*NL*
palsy
;
her
face
,
distorted
into
a
mumbling
leer
,
resembled
more
the
*NL*
grotesque
shaping
of
some
wild
pencil
,
than
the
work
of
Nature
's
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alas
!
How
few
of
Nature
's
faces
are
left
alone
to
gladden
us
with
*NL*
their
beauty
!
The
cares
,
and
sorrows
,
and
hungerings
,
of
the
world
,
*NL*
change
them
as
they
change
hearts
;
and
it
is
only
when
those
passions
*NL*
sleep
,
and
have
lost
their
hold
for
ever
,
that
the
troubled
clouds
pass
*NL*
off
,
and
leave
Heaven
's
surface
clear
.
It
is
a
common
thing
for
the
*NL*
countenances
of
the
dead
,
even
in
that
fixed
and
rigid
state
,
to
*NL*
subside
into
the
long-forgotten
expression
of
sleeping
infancy
,
and
*NL*
settle
into
the
very
look
of
early
life
;
so
calm
,
so
peaceful
,
do
they
*NL*
grow
again
,
that
those
who
knew
them
in
their
happy
childhood
,
kneel
by
*NL*
the
coffin
's
side
in
awe
,
and
see
the
Angel
even
upon
earth
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
crone
tottered
along
the
passages
,
and
up
the
stairs
,
muttering
*NL*
some
indistinct
answers
to
the
chidings
of
her
companion
;
being
at
*NL*
length
compelled
to
pause
for
breath
,
she
gave
the
light
into
her
hand
,
*NL*
and
remained
behind
to
follow
as
she
might
:
while
the
more
nimble
*NL*
superior
made
her
way
to
the
room
where
the
sick
woman
lay
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
bare
garret-room
,
with
a
dim
light
burning
at
the
farther
end
.
*NL*
There
was
another
old
woman
watching
by
the
bed
;
the
parish
*NL*
apothecary
's
apprentice
was
standing
by
the
fire
,
making
a
toothpick
*NL*
out
of
a
quill
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Cold
night
,
Mrs.
Corney
,
'
said
this
young
gentleman
,
as
the
matron
*NL*
entered
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Very
cold
,
indeed
,
sir
,
'
replied
the
mistress
,
in
her
most
civil
*NL*
tones
,
and
dropping
a
curtsey
as
she
spoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
should
get
better
coals
out
of
your
contractors
,
'
said
the
*NL*
apothecary
's
deputy
,
breaking
a
lump
on
the
top
of
the
fire
with
the
*NL*
rusty
poker
;
`
these
are
not
at
all
the
sort
of
thing
for
a
cold
night
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
They
're
the
board
's
choosing
,
sir
,
'
returned
the
matron
.
`
The
least
*NL*
they
could
do
,
would
be
to
keep
us
pretty
warm
:
for
our
places
are
*NL*
hard
enough
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
conversation
was
here
interrupted
by
a
moan
from
the
sick
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
!
'
said
the
young
mag
,
turning
his
face
towards
the
bed
,
as
if
he
*NL*
had
previously
quite
forgotten
the
patient
,
`
it
's
all
U.P.
there
,
Mrs.
*NL*
Corney
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
is
,
is
it
,
sir
?
'
asked
the
matron
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
If
she
lasts
a
couple
of
hours
,
I
shall
be
surprised
,
'
said
the
*NL*
apothecary
's
apprentice
,
intent
upon
the
toothpick
's
point
.
`
It
's
a
*NL*
break-up
of
the
system
altogether
.
Is
she
dozing
,
old
lady
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
attendant
stooped
over
the
bed
,
to
ascertain
;
and
nodded
in
the
*NL*
affirmative
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Then
perhaps
she
'll
go
off
in
that
way
,
if
you
do
n't
make
a
row
,
'
said
*NL*
the
young
man
.
`
Put
the
light
on
the
floor
.
She
wo
n't
see
it
there
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
attendant
did
as
she
was
told
:
shaking
her
head
meanwhile
,
to
*NL*
intimate
that
the
woman
would
not
die
so
easily
;
having
done
so
,
she
*NL*
resumed
her
seat
by
the
side
of
the
other
nurse
,
who
had
by
this
time
*NL*
returned
.
The
mistress
,
with
an
expression
of
impatience
,
wrapped
*NL*
herself
in
her
shawl
,
and
sat
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
apothecary
's
apprentice
,
having
completed
the
manufacture
of
the
*NL*
toothpick
,
planted
himself
in
front
of
the
fire
and
made
good
use
of
it
*NL*
for
ten
minutes
or
so
:
when
apparently
growing
rather
dull
,
he
wished
*NL*
Mrs.
Corney
joy
of
her
job
,
and
took
himself
off
on
tiptoe
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
had
sat
in
silence
for
some
time
,
the
two
old
women
rose
from
*NL*
the
bed
,
and
crouching
over
the
fire
,
held
out
their
withered
hands
to
*NL*
catch
the
heat
.
The
flame
threw
a
ghastly
light
on
their
shrivelled
*NL*
faces
,
and
made
their
ugliness
appear
terrible
,
as
,
in
this
position
,
*NL*
they
began
to
converse
in
a
low
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Did
she
say
any
more
,
Anny
dear
,
while
I
was
gone
?
'
inquired
the
*NL*
messenger
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Not
a
word
,
'
replied
the
other
.
`
She
plucked
and
tore
at
her
arms
for
*NL*
a
little
time
;
but
I
held
her
hands
,
and
she
soon
dropped
off
.
She
*NL*
has
n't
much
strength
in
her
,
so
I
easily
kept
her
quiet
.
I
ai
n't
so
*NL*
weak
for
an
old
woman
,
although
I
am
on
parish
allowance
;
no
,
no
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Did
she
drink
the
hot
wine
the
doctor
said
she
was
to
have
?
'
demanded
*NL*
the
first
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
tried
to
get
it
down
,
'
rejoined
the
other
.
`
But
her
teeth
were
*NL*
tight
set
,
and
she
clenched
the
mug
so
hard
that
it
was
as
much
as
I
*NL*
could
do
to
get
it
back
again
.
So
I
drank
it
;
and
it
did
me
good
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Looking
cautiously
round
,
to
ascertain
that
they
were
not
overheard
,
*NL*
the
two
hags
cowered
nearer
to
the
fire
,
and
chuckled
heartily
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
mind
the
time
,
'
said
the
first
speaker
,
`
when
she
would
have
done
*NL*
the
same
,
and
made
rare
fun
of
it
afterwards
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ay
,
that
she
would
,
'
rejoined
the
other
;
`
she
had
a
merry
heart
.
'
A
*NL*
many
,
many
,
beautiful
corpses
she
laid
out
,
as
nice
and
neat
as
*NL*
waxwork
.
My
old
eyes
have
seen
them
--
ay
,
and
those
old
hands
touched
*NL*
them
too
;
for
I
have
helped
her
,
scores
of
times
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Stretching
forth
her
trembling
fingers
as
she
spoke
,
the
old
creature
*NL*
shook
them
exultingly
before
her
face
,
and
fumbling
in
her
pocket
,
*NL*
brought
out
an
old
time-discoloured
tin
snuff-box
,
from
which
she
shook
*NL*
a
few
grains
into
the
outstretched
palm
of
her
companion
,
and
a
few
*NL*
more
into
her
own
.
While
they
were
thus
employed
,
the
matron
,
who
had
*NL*
been
impatiently
watching
until
the
dying
woman
should
awaken
from
her
*NL*
stupor
,
joined
them
by
the
fire
,
and
sharply
asked
how
long
she
was
to
*NL*
wait
?
*NL*
*NL*
`
Not
long
,
mistress
,
'
replied
the
second
woman
,
looking
up
into
her
*NL*
face
.
`
We
have
none
of
us
long
to
wait
for
Death
.
Patience
,
patience
!
*NL*
He
'll
be
here
soon
enough
for
us
all
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Hold
your
tongue
,
you
doting
idiot
!
'
said
the
matron
sternly
.
`
You
,
*NL*
Martha
,
tell
me
;
has
she
been
in
this
way
before
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Often
,
'
answered
the
first
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
will
never
be
again
,
'
added
the
second
one
;
`
that
is
,
she
'll
never
*NL*
wake
again
but
once
--
and
mind
,
mistress
,
that
wo
n't
be
for
long
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Long
or
short
,
'
said
the
matron
,
snappishly
,
`
she
wo
n't
find
me
here
*NL*
when
she
does
wake
;
take
care
,
both
of
you
,
how
you
worry
me
again
for
*NL*
nothing
.
It
's
no
part
of
my
duty
to
see
all
the
old
women
in
the
house
*NL*
die
,
and
I
wo
n't
--
that
's
more
.
Mind
that
,
you
impudent
old
harridans
.
*NL*
If
you
make
a
fool
of
me
again
,
I
'll
soon
cure
you
,
I
warrant
you
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
bouncing
away
,
when
a
cry
from
the
two
women
,
who
had
turned
*NL*
towards
the
bed
,
caused
her
to
look
round
.
The
patient
had
raised
*NL*
herself
upright
,
and
was
stretching
her
arms
towards
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Who
's
that
?
'
she
cried
,
in
a
hollow
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Hush
,
hush
!
'
said
one
of
the
women
,
stooping
over
her
.
`
Lie
down
,
lie
*NL*
down
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
'll
never
lie
down
again
alive
!
'
said
the
woman
,
struggling
.
'
I
*NL*
_
will
_
tell
her
!
Come
here
!
Nearer
!
Let
me
whisper
in
your
ear
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
clutched
the
matron
by
the
arm
,
and
forcing
her
into
a
chair
by
the
*NL*
bedside
,
was
about
to
speak
,
when
looking
round
,
she
caught
sight
of
*NL*
the
two
old
women
bending
forward
in
the
attitude
of
eager
listeners
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Turn
them
away
,
'
said
the
woman
,
drowsily
;
`
make
haste
!
make
haste
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
old
crones
,
chiming
in
together
,
began
pouring
out
many
piteous
*NL*
lamentations
that
the
poor
dear
was
too
far
gone
to
know
her
best
*NL*
friends
;
and
were
uttering
sundry
protestations
that
they
would
never
*NL*
leave
her
,
when
the
superior
pushed
them
from
the
room
,
closed
the
*NL*
door
,
and
returned
to
the
bedside
.
On
being
excluded
,
the
old
ladies
*NL*
changed
their
tone
,
and
cried
through
the
keyhole
that
old
Sally
was
*NL*
drunk
;
which
,
indeed
,
was
not
unlikely
;
since
,
in
addition
to
a
*NL*
moderate
dose
of
opium
prescribed
by
the
apothecary
,
she
was
labouring
*NL*
under
the
effects
of
a
final
taste
of
gin-and-water
which
had
been
*NL*
privily
administered
,
in
the
openness
of
their
hearts
,
by
the
worthy
*NL*
old
ladies
themselves
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Now
listen
to
me
,
'
said
the
dying
woman
aloud
,
as
if
making
a
great
*NL*
effort
to
revive
one
latent
spark
of
energy
.
`
In
this
very
room
--
in
*NL*
this
very
bed
--
I
once
nursed
a
pretty
young
creetur
'
,
that
was
brought
*NL*
into
the
house
with
her
feet
cut
and
bruised
with
walking
,
and
all
*NL*
soiled
with
dust
and
blood
.
She
gave
birth
to
a
boy
,
and
died
.
Let
me
*NL*
think
--
what
was
the
year
again
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Never
mind
the
year
,
'
said
the
impatient
auditor
;
`
what
about
her
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ay
,
'
murmured
the
sick
woman
,
relapsing
into
her
former
drowsy
state
,
*NL*
`
what
about
her
?
--
what
about
--
I
know
!
'
she
cried
,
jumping
fiercely
up
:
*NL*
her
face
flushed
,
and
her
eyes
starting
from
her
head
--
'
I
robbed
her
,
*NL*
so
I
did
!
She
was
n't
cold
--
I
tell
you
she
was
n't
cold
,
when
I
stole
*NL*
it
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Stole
what
,
for
God
's
sake
?
'
cried
the
matron
,
with
a
gesture
as
if
*NL*
she
would
call
for
help
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
_
It
_
!
'
replied
the
woman
,
laying
her
hand
over
the
other
's
mouth
.
`
The
*NL*
only
thing
she
had
.
She
wanted
clothes
to
keep
her
warm
,
and
food
to
*NL*
eat
;
but
she
had
kept
it
safe
,
and
had
it
in
her
bosom
.
It
was
gold
,
I
*NL*
tell
you
!
Rich
gold
,
that
might
have
saved
her
life
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Gold
!
'
echoed
the
matron
,
bending
eagerly
over
the
woman
as
she
fell
*NL*
back
.
`
Go
on
,
go
on
--
yes
--
what
of
it
?
Who
was
the
mother
?
When
was
*NL*
it
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
She
charge
me
to
keep
it
safe
,
'
replied
the
woman
with
a
groan
,
`
and
*NL*
trusted
me
as
the
only
woman
about
her
.
I
stole
it
in
my
heart
when
*NL*
she
first
showed
it
me
hanging
round
her
neck
;
and
the
child
's
death
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
is
on
me
besides
!
They
would
have
treated
him
better
,
if
they
*NL*
had
known
it
all
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Known
what
?
'
asked
the
other
.
`
Speak
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
boy
grew
so
like
his
mother
,
'
said
the
woman
,
rambling
on
,
and
not
*NL*
heeding
the
question
,
`
that
I
could
never
forget
it
when
I
saw
his
*NL*
face
.
Poor
girl
!
poor
girl
!
She
was
so
young
,
too
!
Such
a
gentle
*NL*
lamb
!
Wait
;
there
's
more
to
tell
.
I
have
not
told
you
all
,
have
I
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
no
,
'
replied
the
matron
,
inclining
her
head
to
catch
the
words
,
as
*NL*
they
came
more
faintly
from
the
dying
woman
.
`
Be
quick
,
or
it
may
be
*NL*
too
late
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
mother
,
'
said
the
woman
,
making
a
more
violent
effort
than
before
;
*NL*
`
the
mother
,
when
the
pains
of
death
first
came
upon
her
,
whispered
in
*NL*
my
ear
that
if
her
baby
was
born
alive
,
and
thrived
,
the
day
might
come
*NL*
when
it
would
not
feel
so
much
disgraced
to
hear
its
poor
young
mother
*NL*
named
.
``
And
oh
,
kind
Heaven
!
''
she
said
,
folding
her
thin
hands
*NL*
together
,
``
whether
it
be
boy
or
girl
,
raise
up
some
friends
for
it
in
*NL*
this
troubled
world
,
and
take
pity
upon
a
lonely
desolate
child
,
*NL*
abandoned
to
its
mercy
!
''
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
boy
's
name
?
'
demanded
the
matron
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
They
_
called
_
him
Oliver
,
'
replied
the
woman
,
feebly
.
`
The
gold
I
*NL*
stole
was
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
yes
--
what
?
'
cried
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
bending
eagerly
over
the
woman
to
hear
her
reply
;
but
drew
*NL*
back
,
instinctively
,
as
she
once
again
rose
,
slowly
and
stiffly
,
into
a
*NL*
sitting
posture
;
then
,
clutching
the
coverlid
with
both
hands
,
muttered
*NL*
some
indistinct
sounds
in
her
throat
,
and
fell
lifeless
on
the
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
`
Stone
dead
!
'
said
one
of
the
old
women
,
hurrying
in
as
soon
as
the
*NL*
door
was
opened
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
nothing
to
tell
,
after
all
,
'
rejoined
the
matron
,
walking
*NL*
carelessly
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
crones
,
to
all
appearance
,
too
busily
occupied
in
the
*NL*
preparations
for
their
dreadful
duties
to
make
any
reply
,
were
left
*NL*
alone
,
hovering
about
the

CHAPTER
XXV
*NL*
*NL*
WHEREIN
THIS
HISTORY
REVERTS
TO
MR.
FAGIN
AND
COMPANY
*NL*
*NL*
While
these
things
were
passing
in
the
country
workhouse
,
Mr.
Fagin
sat
*NL*
in
the
old
den
--
the
same
from
which
Oliver
had
been
removed
by
the
*NL*
girl
--
brooding
over
a
dull
,
smoky
fire
.
He
held
a
pair
of
bellows
upon
*NL*
his
knee
,
with
which
he
had
apparently
been
endeavouring
to
rouse
it
*NL*
into
more
cheerful
action
;
but
he
had
fallen
into
deep
thought
;
and
*NL*
with
his
arms
folded
on
them
,
and
his
chin
resting
on
his
thumbs
,
fixed
*NL*
his
eyes
,
abstractedly
,
on
the
rusty
bars
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
a
table
behind
him
sat
the
Artful
Dodger
,
Master
Charles
Bates
,
and
*NL*
Mr.
Chitling
:
all
intent
upon
a
game
of
whist
;
the
Artful
taking
dummy
*NL*
against
Master
Bates
and
Mr.
Chitling
.
The
countenance
of
the
*NL*
first-named
gentleman
,
peculiarly
intelligent
at
all
times
,
acquired
*NL*
great
additional
interest
from
his
close
observance
of
the
game
,
and
*NL*
his
attentive
perusal
of
Mr.
Chitling
's
hand
;
upon
which
,
from
time
to
*NL*
time
,
as
occasion
served
,
he
bestowed
a
variety
of
earnest
glances
:
*NL*
wisely
regulating
his
own
play
by
the
result
of
his
observations
upon
*NL*
his
neighbour
's
cards
.
It
being
a
cold
night
,
the
Dodger
wore
his
hat
,
*NL*
as
,
indeed
,
was
often
his
custom
within
doors
.
He
also
sustained
a
*NL*
clay
pipe
between
his
teeth
,
which
he
only
removed
for
a
brief
space
*NL*
when
he
deemed
it
necessary
to
apply
for
refreshment
to
a
quart
pot
*NL*
upon
the
table
,
which
stood
ready
filled
with
gin-and-water
for
the
*NL*
accommodation
of
the
company
.
*NL*
*NL*
Master
Bates
was
also
attentive
to
the
play
;
but
being
of
a
more
*NL*
excitable
nature
than
his
accomplished
friend
,
it
was
observable
that
*NL*
he
more
frequently
applied
himself
to
the
gin-and-water
,
and
moreover
*NL*
indulged
in
many
jests
and
irrelevant
remarks
,
all
highly
unbecoming
a
*NL*
scientific
rubber
.
Indeed
,
the
Artful
,
presuming
upon
their
close
*NL*
attachment
,
more
than
once
took
occasion
to
reason
gravely
with
his
*NL*
companion
upon
these
improprieties
;
all
of
which
remonstrances
,
Master
*NL*
Bates
received
in
extremely
good
part
;
merely
requesting
his
friend
to
*NL*
be
`
blowed
,
'
or
to
insert
his
head
in
a
sack
,
or
replying
with
some
*NL*
other
neatly-turned
witticism
of
a
similar
kind
,
the
happy
application
*NL*
of
which
,
excited
considerable
admiration
in
the
mind
of
Mr.
Chitling
.
*NL*
It
was
remarkable
that
the
latter
gentleman
and
his
partner
invariably
*NL*
lost
;
and
that
the
circumstance
,
so
far
from
angering
Master
Bates
,
*NL*
appeared
to
afford
him
the
highest
amusement
,
inasmuch
as
he
laughed
*NL*
most
uproariously
at
the
end
of
every
deal
,
and
protested
that
he
had
*NL*
never
seen
such
a
jolly
game
in
all
his
born
days
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
's
two
doubles
and
the
rub
,
'
said
Mr.
Chitling
,
with
a
very
long
*NL*
face
,
as
he
drew
half-a-crown
from
his
waistcoat-pocket
.
'
I
never
see
*NL*
such
a
feller
as
you
,
Jack
;
you
win
everything
.
Even
when
we
've
good
*NL*
cards
,
Charley
and
I
ca
n't
make
nothing
of
'em
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Either
the
master
or
the
manner
of
this
remark
,
which
was
made
very
*NL*
ruefully
,
delighted
Charley
Bates
so
much
,
that
his
consequent
shout
of
*NL*
laughter
roused
the
Jew
from
his
reverie
,
and
induced
him
to
inquire
*NL*
what
was
the
matter
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Matter
,
Fagin
!
'
cried
Charley
.
'
I
wish
you
had
watched
the
play
.
*NL*
Tommy
Chitling
has
n't
won
a
point
;
and
I
went
partners
with
him
against
*NL*
the
Artfull
and
dumb
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ay
,
ay
!
'
said
the
Jew
,
with
a
grin
,
which
sufficiently
demonstrated
*NL*
that
he
was
at
no
loss
to
understand
the
reason
.
`
Try
'em
again
,
Tom
;
*NL*
try
'em
again
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
more
of
it
for
me
,
thank
`
ee
,
Fagin
,
'
replied
Mr.
Chitling
;
`
I
've
*NL*
had
enough
.
That
`
ere
Dodger
has
such
a
run
of
luck
that
there
's
no
*NL*
standing
again
'
him
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ha
!
ha
!
my
dear
,
'
replied
the
Jew
,
`
you
must
get
up
very
early
in
the
*NL*
morning
,
to
win
against
the
Dodger
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Morning
!
'
said
Charley
Bates
;
`
you
must
put
your
boots
on
over-night
,
*NL*
and
have
a
telescope
at
each
eye
,
and
a
opera-glass
between
your
*NL*
shoulders
,
if
you
want
to
come
over
him
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Dawkins
received
these
handsome
compliments
with
much
philosophy
,
*NL*
and
offered
to
cut
any
gentleman
in
company
,
for
the
first
*NL*
picture-card
,
at
a
shilling
at
a
time
.
Nobody
accepting
the
challenge
,
*NL*
and
his
pipe
being
by
this
time
smoked
out
,
he
proceeded
to
amuse
*NL*
himself
by
sketching
a
ground-plan
of
Newgate
on
the
table
with
the
*NL*
piece
of
chalk
which
had
served
him
in
lieu
of
counters
;
whistling
,
*NL*
meantime
,
with
peculiar
shrillness
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
How
precious
dull
you
are
,
Tommy
!
'
said
the
Dodger
,
stopping
short
*NL*
when
there
had
been
a
long
silence
;
and
addressing
Mr.
Chitling
.
`
What
*NL*
do
you
think
he
's
thinking
of
,
Fagin
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
How
should
I
know
,
my
dear
?
'
replied
the
Jew
,
looking
round
as
he
*NL*
plied
the
bellows
.
`
About
his
losses
,
maybe
;
or
the
little
retirement
*NL*
in
the
country
that
he
's
just
left
,
eh
?
Ha
!
ha
!
Is
that
it
,
my
dear
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Not
a
bit
of
it
,
'
replied
the
Dodger
,
stopping
the
subject
of
*NL*
discourse
as
Mr.
Chitling
was
about
to
reply
.
`
What
do
_
you
_
say
,
*NL*
Charley
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
_
I
_
should
say
,
'
replied
Master
Bates
,
with
a
grin
,
`
that
he
was
*NL*
uncommon
sweet
upon
Betsy
.
See
how
he
's
a-blushing
!
Oh
,
my
eye
!
*NL*
here
's
a
merry-go-rounder
!
Tommy
Chitling
's
in
love
!
Oh
,
Fagin
,
*NL*
Fagin
!
what
a
spree
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Thoroughly
overpowered
with
the
notion
of
Mr.
Chitling
being
the
victim
*NL*
of
the
tender
passion
,
Master
Bates
threw
himself
back
in
his
chair
*NL*
with
such
violence
,
that
he
lost
his
balance
,
and
pitched
over
upon
the
*NL*
floor
;
where
-LRB-
the
accident
abating
nothing
of
his
merriment
-RRB-
he
lay
at
*NL*
full
length
until
his
laugh
was
over
,
when
he
resumed
his
former
*NL*
position
,
and
began
another
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Never
mind
him
,
my
dear
,
'
said
the
Jew
,
winking
at
Mr.
Dawkins
,
and
*NL*
giving
Master
Bates
a
reproving
tap
with
the
nozzle
of
the
bellows
.
*NL*
`
Betsy
's
a
fine
girl
.
Stick
up
to
her
,
Tom
.
Stick
up
to
her
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
I
mean
to
say
,
Fagin
,
'
replied
Mr.
Chitling
,
very
red
in
the
*NL*
face
,
`
is
,
that
that
is
n't
anything
to
anybody
here
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
more
it
is
,
'
replied
the
Jew
;
`
Charley
will
talk
.
Do
n't
mind
him
,
*NL*
my
dear
;
do
n't
mind
him
.
Betsy
's
a
fine
girl
.
Do
as
she
bids
you
,
*NL*
Tom
,
and
you
will
make
your
fortune
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
So
I
_
do
_
do
as
she
bids
me
,
'
replied
Mr.
Chitling
;
'
I
should
n't
have
*NL*
been
milled
,
if
it
had
n't
been
for
her
advice
.
But
it
turned
out
a
*NL*
good
job
for
you
;
did
n't
it
,
Fagin
!
And
what
's
six
weeks
of
it
?
It
*NL*
must
come
,
some
time
or
another
,
and
why
not
in
the
winter
time
when
*NL*
you
do
n't
want
to
go
out
a-walking
so
much
;
eh
,
Fagin
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ah
,
to
be
sure
,
my
dear
,
'
replied
the
Jew
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
would
n't
mind
it
again
,
Tom
,
would
you
,
'
asked
the
Dodger
,
winking
*NL*
upon
Charley
and
the
Jew
,
`
if
Bet
was
all
right
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
mean
to
say
that
I
should
n't
,
'
replied
Tom
,
angrily
.
`
There
,
now
.
*NL*
Ah
!
Who
'll
say
as
much
as
that
,
I
should
like
to
know
;
eh
,
Fagin
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Nobody
,
my
dear
,
'
replied
the
Jew
;
`
not
a
soul
,
Tom
.
I
do
n't
know
one
*NL*
of
'em
that
would
do
it
besides
you
;
not
one
of
'em
,
my
dear
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
might
have
got
clear
off
,
if
I
'd
split
upon
her
;
might
n't
I
,
Fagin
?
'
*NL*
angrily
pursued
the
poor
half-witted
dupe
.
'
A
word
from
me
would
have
*NL*
done
it
;
would
n't
it
,
Fagin
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
To
be
sure
it
would
,
my
dear
,
'
replied
the
Jew
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
I
did
n't
blab
it
;
did
I
,
Fagin
?
'
demanded
Tom
,
pouring
question
*NL*
upon
question
with
great
volubility
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
no
,
to
be
sure
,
'
replied
the
Jew
;
`
you
were
too
stout-hearted
for
*NL*
that
.
A
deal
too
stout
,
my
dear
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Perhaps
I
was
,
'
rejoined
Tom
,
looking
round
;
`
and
if
I
was
,
what
's
to
*NL*
laugh
at
,
in
that
;
eh
,
Fagin
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
Jew
,
perceiving
that
Mr.
Chitling
was
considerably
roused
,
hastened
*NL*
to
assure
him
that
nobody
was
laughing
;
and
to
prove
the
gravity
of
the
*NL*
company
,
appealed
to
Master
Bates
,
the
principal
offender
.
But
,
*NL*
unfortunately
,
Charley
,
in
opening
his
mouth
to
reply
that
he
was
never
*NL*
more
serious
in
his
life
,
was
unable
to
prevent
the
escape
of
such
a
*NL*
violent
roar
,
that
the
abused
Mr.
Chitling
,
without
any
preliminary
*NL*
ceremonies
,
rushed
across
the
room
and
aimed
a
blow
at
the
offender
;
*NL*
who
,
being
skilful
in
evading
pursuit
,
ducked
to
avoid
it
,
and
chose
*NL*
his
time
so
well
that
it
lighted
on
the
chest
of
the
merry
old
*NL*
gentleman
,
and
caused
him
to
stagger
to
the
wall
,
where
he
stood
*NL*
panting
for
breath
,
while
Mr.
Chitling
looked
on
in
intense
dismay
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Hark
!
'
cried
the
Dodger
at
this
moment
,
'
I
heard
the
tinkler
.
'
*NL*
Catching
up
the
light
,
he
crept
softly
upstairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
bell
was
rung
again
,
with
some
impatience
,
while
the
party
were
in
*NL*
darkness
.
After
a
short
pause
,
the
Dodger
reappeared
,
and
whispered
*NL*
Fagin
mysteriously
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
!
'
cried
the
Jew
,
`
alone
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
Dodger
nodded
in
the
affirmative
,
and
,
shading
the
flame
of
the
*NL*
candle
with
his
hand
,
gave
Charley
Bates
a
private
intimation
,
in
dumb
*NL*
show
,
that
he
had
better
not
be
funny
just
then
.
Having
performed
this
*NL*
friendly
office
,
he
fixed
his
eyes
on
the
Jew
's
face
,
and
awaited
his
*NL*
directions
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
man
bit
his
yellow
fingers
,
and
meditated
for
some
seconds
;
his
*NL*
face
working
with
agitation
the
while
,
as
if
he
dreaded
something
,
and
*NL*
feared
to
know
the
worst
.
At
length
he
raised
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Where
is
he
?
'
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Dodger
pointed
to
the
floor
above
,
and
made
a
gesture
,
as
if
to
*NL*
leave
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
'
said
the
Jew
,
answering
the
mute
inquiry
;
`
bring
him
down
.
Hush
!
*NL*
Quiet
,
Charley
!
Gently
,
Tom
!
Scarce
,
scarce
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
This
brief
direction
to
Charley
Bates
,
and
his
recent
antagonist
,
was
*NL*
softly
and
immediately
obeyed
.
There
was
no
sound
of
their
whereabout
,
*NL*
when
the
Dodger
descended
the
stairs
,
bearing
the
light
in
his
hand
,
*NL*
and
followed
by
a
man
in
a
coarse
smock-frock
;
who
,
after
casting
a
*NL*
hurried
glance
round
the
room
,
pulled
off
a
large
wrapper
which
had
*NL*
concealed
the
lower
portion
of
his
face
,
and
disclosed
:
all
haggard
,
*NL*
unwashed
,
and
unshorn
:
the
features
of
flash
Toby
Crackit
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
How
are
you
,
Faguey
?
'
said
this
worthy
,
nodding
to
the
Jew
.
`
Pop
that
*NL*
shawl
away
in
my
castor
,
Dodger
,
so
that
I
may
know
where
to
find
it
*NL*
when
I
cut
;
that
's
the
time
of
day
!
You
'll
be
a
fine
young
cracksman
*NL*
afore
the
old
file
now
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
With
these
words
he
pulled
up
the
smock-frock
;
and
,
winding
it
round
*NL*
his
middle
,
drew
a
chair
to
the
fire
,
and
placed
his
feet
upon
the
hob
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
See
there
,
Faguey
,
'
he
said
,
pointing
disconsolately
to
his
top
boots
;
*NL*
`
not
a
drop
of
Day
and
Martin
since
you
know
when
;
not
a
bubble
of
*NL*
blacking
,
by
Jove
!
But
do
n't
look
at
me
in
that
way
,
man
.
All
in
*NL*
good
time
.
I
ca
n't
talk
about
business
till
I
've
eat
and
drank
;
so
*NL*
produce
the
sustainance
,
and
let
's
have
a
quiet
fill-out
for
the
first
*NL*
time
these
three
days
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
Jew
motioned
to
the
Dodger
to
place
what
eatables
there
were
,
upon
*NL*
the
table
;
and
,
seating
himself
opposite
the
housebreaker
,
waited
his
*NL*
leisure
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
judge
from
appearances
,
Toby
was
by
no
means
in
a
hurry
to
open
the
*NL*
conversation
.
At
first
,
the
Jew
contented
himself
with
patiently
*NL*
watching
his
countenance
,
as
if
to
gain
from
its
expression
some
clue
*NL*
to
the
intelligence
he
brought
;
but
in
vain
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
tired
and
worn
,
but
there
was
the
same
complacent
repose
upon
*NL*
his
features
that
they
always
wore
:
and
through
dirt
,
and
beard
,
and
*NL*
whisker
,
there
still
shone
,
unimpaired
,
the
self-satisfied
smirk
of
*NL*
flash
Toby
Crackit
.
Then
the
Jew
,
in
an
agony
of
impatience
,
watched
*NL*
every
morsel
he
put
into
his
mouth
;
pacing
up
and
down
the
room
,
*NL*
meanwhile
,
in
irrepressible
excitement
.
It
was
all
of
no
use
.
Toby
*NL*
continued
to
eat
with
the
utmost
outward
indifference
,
until
he
could
*NL*
eat
no
more
;
then
,
ordering
the
Dodger
out
,
he
closed
the
door
,
mixed
a
*NL*
glass
of
spirits
and
water
,
and
composed
himself
for
talking
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
First
and
foremost
,
Faguey
,
'
said
Toby
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
yes
!
'
interposed
the
Jew
,
drawing
up
his
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Crackit
stopped
to
take
a
draught
of
spirits
and
water
,
and
to
*NL*
declare
that
the
gin
was
excellent
;
then
placing
his
feet
against
the
*NL*
low
mantelpiece
,
so
as
to
bring
his
boots
to
about
the
level
of
his
*NL*
eye
,
he
quietly
resumed
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
First
and
foremost
,
Faguey
,
'
said
the
housebreaker
,
`
how
's
Bill
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
!
'
screamed
the
Jew
,
starting
from
his
seat
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
you
do
n't
mean
to
say
--
'
began
Toby
,
turning
pale
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Mean
!
'
cried
the
Jew
,
stamping
furiously
on
the
ground
.
`
Where
are
*NL*
they
?
Sikes
and
the
boy
!
Where
are
they
?
Where
have
they
been
?
*NL*
Where
are
they
hiding
?
Why
have
they
not
been
here
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
crack
failed
,
'
said
Toby
faintly
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
know
it
,
'
replied
the
Jew
,
tearing
a
newspaper
from
his
pocket
and
*NL*
pointing
to
it
.
`
What
more
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
They
fired
and
hit
the
boy
.
We
cut
over
the
fields
at
the
back
,
with
*NL*
him
between
us
--
straight
as
the
crow
flies
--
through
hedge
and
ditch
.
*NL*
They
gave
chase
.
Damme
!
the
whole
country
was
awake
,
and
the
dogs
upon
*NL*
us
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
boy
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Bill
had
him
on
his
back
,
and
scudded
like
the
wind
.
We
stopped
to
*NL*
take
him
between
us
;
his
head
hung
down
,
and
he
was
cold
.
They
were
*NL*
close
upon
our
heels
;
every
man
for
himself
,
and
each
from
the
gallows
!
*NL*
We
parted
company
,
and
left
the
youngster
lying
in
a
ditch
.
Alive
or
*NL*
dead
,
that
's
all
I
know
about
him
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
Jew
stopped
to
hear
no
more
;
but
uttering
a
loud
yell
,
and
twining
*NL*
his
hands
in
his
hair
,
rushed
from
the
room
,
and
from
the
house
.

CHAPTER
XXVI
*NL*
*NL*
IN
WHICH
A
MYSTERIOUS
CHARACTER
APPEARS
UPON
THE
SCENE
;
AND
MANY
*NL*
THINGS
,
INSEPARABLE
FROM
THIS
HISTORY
,
ARE
DONE
AND
PERFORMED
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
man
had
gained
the
street
corner
,
before
he
began
to
recover
*NL*
the
effect
of
Toby
Crackit
's
intelligence
.
He
had
relaxed
nothing
of
*NL*
his
unusual
speed
;
but
was
still
pressing
onward
,
in
the
same
wild
and
*NL*
disordered
manner
,
when
the
sudden
dashing
past
of
a
carriage
:
and
a
*NL*
boisterous
cry
from
the
foot
passengers
,
who
saw
his
danger
:
drove
him
*NL*
back
upon
the
pavement
.
Avoiding
,
as
much
as
was
possible
,
all
the
*NL*
main
streets
,
and
skulking
only
through
the
by-ways
and
alleys
,
he
at
*NL*
length
emerged
on
Snow
Hill
.
Here
he
walked
even
faster
than
before
;
*NL*
nor
did
he
linger
until
he
had
again
turned
into
a
court
;
when
,
as
if
*NL*
conscious
that
he
was
now
in
his
proper
element
,
he
fell
into
his
usual
*NL*
shuffling
pace
,
and
seemed
to
breathe
more
freely
.
*NL*
*NL*
Near
to
the
spot
on
which
Snow
Hill
and
Holborn
Hill
meet
,
opens
,
upon
*NL*
the
right
hand
as
you
come
out
of
the
City
,
a
narrow
and
dismal
alley
,
*NL*
leading
to
Saffron
Hill
.
In
its
filthy
shops
are
exposed
for
sale
huge
*NL*
bunches
of
second-hand
silk
handkerchiefs
,
of
all
sizes
and
patterns
;
*NL*
for
here
reside
the
traders
who
purchase
them
from
pick-pockets
.
*NL*
Hundreds
of
these
handkerchiefs
hang
dangling
from
pegs
outside
the
*NL*
windows
or
flaunting
from
the
door-posts
;
and
the
shelves
,
within
,
are
*NL*
piled
with
them
.
Confined
as
the
limits
of
Field
Lane
are
,
it
has
its
*NL*
barber
,
its
coffee-shop
,
its
beer-shop
,
and
its
fried-fish
warehouse
.
*NL*
It
is
a
commercial
colony
of
itself
:
the
emporium
of
petty
larceny
:
*NL*
visited
at
early
morning
,
and
setting-in
of
dusk
,
by
silent
merchants
,
*NL*
who
traffic
in
dark
back-parlours
,
and
who
go
as
strangely
as
they
*NL*
come
.
Here
,
the
clothesman
,
the
shoe-vamper
,
and
the
rag-merchant
,
*NL*
display
their
goods
,
as
sign-boards
to
the
petty
thief
;
here
,
stores
of
*NL*
old
iron
and
bones
,
and
heaps
of
mildewy
fragments
of
woollen-stuff
and
*NL*
linen
,
rust
and
rot
in
the
grimy
cellars
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
into
this
place
that
the
Jew
turned
.
He
was
well
known
to
the
*NL*
sallow
denizens
of
the
lane
;
for
such
of
them
as
were
on
the
look-out
*NL*
to
buy
or
sell
,
nodded
,
familiarly
,
as
he
passed
along
.
He
replied
to
*NL*
their
salutations
in
the
same
way
;
but
bestowed
no
closer
recognition
*NL*
until
he
reached
the
further
end
of
the
alley
;
when
he
stopped
,
to
*NL*
address
a
salesman
of
small
stature
,
who
had
squeezed
as
much
of
his
*NL*
person
into
a
child
's
chair
as
the
chair
would
hold
,
and
was
smoking
a
*NL*
pipe
at
his
warehouse
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
the
sight
of
you
,
Mr.
Fagin
,
would
cure
the
hoptalmy
!
'
said
this
*NL*
respectable
trader
,
in
acknowledgment
of
the
Jew
's
inquiry
after
his
*NL*
health
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
neighbourhood
was
a
little
too
hot
,
Lively
,
'
said
Fagin
,
elevating
*NL*
his
eyebrows
,
and
crossing
his
hands
upon
his
shoulders
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
I
've
heerd
that
complaint
of
it
,
once
or
twice
before
,
'
replied
*NL*
the
trader
;
`
but
it
soon
cools
down
again
;
do
n't
you
find
it
so
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
Fagin
nodded
in
the
affirmative
.
Pointing
in
the
direction
of
Saffron
*NL*
Hill
,
he
inquired
whether
any
one
was
up
yonder
to-night
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
At
the
Cripples
?
'
inquired
the
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Jew
nodded
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Let
me
see
,
'
pursued
the
merchant
,
reflecting
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
there
's
some
half-dozen
of
'em
gone
in
,
that
I
knows
.
I
do
n't
*NL*
think
your
friend
's
there
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Sikes
is
not
,
I
suppose
?
'
inquired
the
Jew
,
with
a
disappointed
*NL*
countenance
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
_
Non
istwentus
_
,
as
the
lawyers
say
,
'
replied
the
little
man
,
shaking
*NL*
his
head
,
and
looking
amazingly
sly
.
`
Have
you
got
anything
in
my
line
*NL*
to-night
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Nothing
to-night
,
'
said
the
Jew
,
turning
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Are
you
going
up
to
the
Cripples
,
Fagin
?
'
cried
the
little
man
,
*NL*
calling
after
him
.
`
Stop
!
I
do
n't
mind
if
I
have
a
drop
there
with
*NL*
you
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
But
as
the
Jew
,
looking
back
,
waved
his
hand
to
intimate
that
he
*NL*
preferred
being
alone
;
and
,
moreover
,
as
the
little
man
could
not
very
*NL*
easily
disengage
himself
from
the
chair
;
the
sign
of
the
Cripples
was
,
*NL*
for
a
time
,
bereft
of
the
advantage
of
Mr.
Lively
's
presence
.
By
the
*NL*
time
he
had
got
upon
his
legs
,
the
Jew
had
disappeared
;
so
Mr.
Lively
,
*NL*
after
ineffectually
standing
on
tiptoe
,
in
the
hope
of
catching
sight
*NL*
of
him
,
again
forced
himself
into
the
little
chair
,
and
,
exchanging
a
*NL*
shake
of
the
head
with
a
lady
in
the
opposite
shop
,
in
which
doubt
and
*NL*
mistrust
were
plainly
mingled
,
resumed
his
pipe
with
a
grave
demeanour
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Three
Cripples
,
or
rather
the
Cripples
;
which
was
the
sign
by
which
*NL*
the
establishment
was
familiarly
known
to
its
patrons
:
was
the
*NL*
public-house
in
which
Mr.
Sikes
and
his
dog
have
already
figured
.
*NL*
Merely
making
a
sign
to
a
man
at
the
bar
,
Fagin
walked
straight
*NL*
upstairs
,
and
opening
the
door
of
a
room
,
and
softly
insinuating
*NL*
himself
into
the
chamber
,
looked
anxiously
about
:
shading
his
eyes
with
*NL*
his
hand
,
as
if
in
search
of
some
particular
person
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
room
was
illuminated
by
two
gas-lights
;
the
glare
of
which
was
*NL*
prevented
by
the
barred
shutters
,
and
closely-drawn
curtains
of
faded
*NL*
red
,
from
being
visible
outside
.
The
ceiling
was
blackened
,
to
prevent
*NL*
its
colour
from
being
injured
by
the
flaring
of
the
lamps
;
and
the
*NL*
place
was
so
full
of
dense
tobacco
smoke
,
that
at
first
it
was
scarcely
*NL*
possible
to
discern
anything
more
.
By
degrees
,
however
,
as
some
of
it
*NL*
cleared
away
through
the
open
door
,
an
assemblage
of
heads
,
as
confused
*NL*
as
the
noises
that
greeted
the
ear
,
might
be
made
out
;
and
as
the
eye
*NL*
grew
more
accustomed
to
the
scene
,
the
spectator
gradually
became
aware
*NL*
of
the
presence
of
a
numerous
company
,
male
and
female
,
crowded
round
a
*NL*
long
table
:
at
the
upper
end
of
which
,
sat
a
chairman
with
a
hammer
of
*NL*
office
in
his
hand
;
while
a
professional
gentleman
with
a
bluish
nose
,
*NL*
and
his
face
tied
up
for
the
benefit
of
a
toothache
,
presided
at
a
*NL*
jingling
piano
in
a
remote
corner
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
Fagin
stepped
softly
in
,
the
professional
gentleman
,
running
over
*NL*
the
keys
by
way
of
prelude
,
occasioned
a
general
cry
of
order
for
a
*NL*
song
;
which
having
subsided
,
a
young
lady
proceeded
to
entertain
the
*NL*
company
with
a
ballad
in
four
verses
,
between
each
of
which
the
*NL*
accompanyist
played
the
melody
all
through
,
as
loud
as
he
could
.
When
*NL*
this
was
over
,
the
chairman
gave
a
sentiment
,
after
which
,
the
*NL*
professional
gentleman
on
the
chairman
's
right
and
left
volunteered
a
*NL*
duet
,
and
sang
it
,
with
great
applause
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
curious
to
observe
some
faces
which
stood
out
prominently
from
*NL*
among
the
group
.
There
was
the
chairman
himself
,
-LRB-
the
landlord
of
the
*NL*
house
,
-RRB-
a
coarse
,
rough
,
heavy
built
fellow
,
who
,
while
the
songs
were
*NL*
proceeding
,
rolled
his
eyes
hither
and
thither
,
and
,
seeming
to
give
*NL*
himself
up
to
joviality
,
had
an
eye
for
everything
that
was
done
,
and
*NL*
an
ear
for
everything
that
was
said
--
and
sharp
ones
,
too
.
Near
him
*NL*
were
the
singers
:
receiving
,
with
professional
indifference
,
the
*NL*
compliments
of
the
company
,
and
applying
themselves
,
in
turn
,
to
a
*NL*
dozen
proffered
glasses
of
spirits
and
water
,
tendered
by
their
more
*NL*
boisterous
admirers
;
whose
countenances
,
expressive
of
almost
every
*NL*
vice
in
almost
every
grade
,
irresistibly
attracted
the
attention
,
by
*NL*
their
very
repulsiveness
.
Cunning
,
ferocity
,
and
drunkeness
in
all
its
*NL*
stages
,
were
there
,
in
their
strongest
aspect
;
and
women
:
some
with
the
*NL*
last
lingering
tinge
of
their
early
freshness
almost
fading
as
you
*NL*
looked
:
others
with
every
mark
and
stamp
of
their
sex
utterly
beaten
*NL*
out
,
and
presenting
but
one
loathsome
blank
of
profligacy
and
crime
;
*NL*
some
mere
girls
,
others
but
young
women
,
and
none
past
the
prime
of
*NL*
life
;
formed
the
darkest
and
saddest
portion
of
this
dreary
picture
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fagin
,
troubled
by
no
grave
emotions
,
looked
eagerly
from
face
to
face
*NL*
while
these
proceedings
were
in
progress
;
but
apparently
without
*NL*
meeting
that
of
which
he
was
in
search
.
Succeeding
,
at
length
,
in
*NL*
catching
the
eye
of
the
man
who
occupied
the
chair
,
he
beckoned
to
him
*NL*
slightly
,
and
left
the
room
,
as
quietly
as
he
had
entered
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
can
I
do
for
you
,
Mr.
Fagin
?
'
inquired
the
man
,
as
he
followed
*NL*
him
out
to
the
landing
.
`
Wo
n't
you
join
us
?
They
'll
be
delighted
,
*NL*
every
one
of
'em
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
Jew
shook
his
head
impatiently
,
and
said
in
a
whisper
,
`
Is
_
he
_
*NL*
here
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
'
replied
the
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
no
news
of
Barney
?
'
inquired
Fagin
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
None
,
'
replied
the
landlord
of
the
Cripples
;
for
it
was
he
.
`
He
wo
n't
*NL*
stir
till
it
's
all
safe
.
Depend
on
it
,
they
're
on
the
scent
down
*NL*
there
;
and
that
if
he
moved
,
he
'd
blow
upon
the
thing
at
once
.
He
's
*NL*
all
right
enough
,
Barney
is
,
else
I
should
have
heard
of
him
.
I
'll
*NL*
pound
it
,
that
Barney
's
managing
properly
.
Let
him
alone
for
that
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Will
_
he
_
be
here
to-night
?
'
asked
the
Jew
,
laying
the
same
emphasis
*NL*
on
the
pronoun
as
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Monks
,
do
you
mean
?
'
inquired
the
landlord
,
hesitating
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Hush
!
'
said
the
Jew
.
`
Yes
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Certain
,
'
replied
the
man
,
drawing
a
gold
watch
from
his
fob
;
'
I
*NL*
expected
him
here
before
now
.
If
you
'll
wait
ten
minutes
,
he
'll
be
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
no
,
'
said
the
Jew
,
hastily
;
as
though
,
however
desirous
he
might
*NL*
be
to
see
the
person
in
question
,
he
was
nevertheless
relieved
by
his
*NL*
absence
.
`
Tell
him
I
came
here
to
see
him
;
and
that
he
must
come
to
me
*NL*
to-night
.
No
,
say
to-morrow
.
As
he
is
not
here
,
to-morrow
will
be
*NL*
time
enough
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Good
!
'
said
the
man
.
`
Nothing
more
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Not
a
word
now
,
'
said
the
Jew
,
descending
the
stairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
say
,
'
said
the
other
,
looking
over
the
rails
,
and
speaking
in
a
*NL*
hoarse
whisper
;
`
what
a
time
this
would
be
for
a
sell
!
I
've
got
Phil
*NL*
Barker
here
:
so
drunk
,
that
a
boy
might
take
him
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ah
!
But
it
's
not
Phil
Barker
's
time
,
'
said
the
Jew
,
looking
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Phil
has
something
more
to
do
,
before
we
can
afford
to
part
with
him
;
*NL*
so
go
back
to
the
company
,
my
dear
,
and
tell
them
to
lead
merry
*NL*
lives
--
_
while
they
last
_
.
Ha
!
ha
!
ha
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
landlord
reciprocated
the
old
man
's
laugh
;
and
returned
to
his
*NL*
guests
.
The
Jew
was
no
sooner
alone
,
than
his
countenance
resumed
its
*NL*
former
expression
of
anxiety
and
thought
.
After
a
brief
reflection
,
he
*NL*
called
a
hack-cabriolet
,
and
bade
the
man
drive
towards
Bethnal
Green
.
*NL*
He
dismissed
him
within
some
quarter
of
a
mile
of
Mr.
Sikes
's
*NL*
residence
,
and
performed
the
short
remainder
of
the
distance
,
on
foot
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Now
,
'
muttered
the
Jew
,
as
he
knocked
at
the
door
,
`
if
there
is
any
*NL*
deep
play
here
,
I
shall
have
it
out
of
you
,
my
girl
,
cunning
as
you
*NL*
are
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
in
her
room
,
the
woman
said
.
Fagin
crept
softly
upstairs
,
and
*NL*
entered
it
without
any
previous
ceremony
.
The
girl
was
alone
;
lying
*NL*
with
her
head
upon
the
table
,
and
her
hair
straggling
over
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
She
has
been
drinking
,
'
thought
the
Jew
,
cooly
,
`
or
perhaps
she
is
*NL*
only
miserable
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
man
turned
to
close
the
door
,
as
he
made
this
reflection
;
the
*NL*
noise
thus
occasioned
,
roused
the
girl
.
She
eyed
his
crafty
face
*NL*
narrowly
,
as
she
inquired
to
his
recital
of
Toby
Crackit
's
story
.
When
*NL*
it
was
concluded
,
she
sank
into
her
former
attitude
,
but
spoke
not
a
*NL*
word
.
She
pushed
the
candle
impatiently
away
;
and
once
or
twice
as
she
*NL*
feverishly
changed
her
position
,
shuffled
her
feet
upon
the
ground
;
but
*NL*
this
was
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
silence
,
the
Jew
looked
restlessly
about
the
room
,
as
if
to
*NL*
assure
himself
that
there
were
no
appearances
of
Sikes
having
covertly
*NL*
returned
.
Apparently
satisfied
with
his
inspection
,
he
coughed
twice
*NL*
or
thrice
,
and
made
as
many
efforts
to
open
a
conversation
;
but
the
*NL*
girl
heeded
him
no
more
than
if
he
had
been
made
of
stone
.
At
length
*NL*
he
made
another
attempt
;
and
rubbing
his
hands
together
,
said
,
in
his
*NL*
most
conciliatory
tone
,
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
where
should
you
think
Bill
was
now
,
my
dear
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
girl
moaned
out
some
half
intelligible
reply
,
that
she
could
not
*NL*
tell
;
and
seemed
,
from
the
smothered
noise
that
escaped
her
,
to
be
*NL*
crying
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
the
boy
,
too
,
'
said
the
Jew
,
straining
his
eyes
to
catch
a
glimpse
*NL*
of
her
face
.
`
Poor
leetle
child
!
Left
in
a
ditch
,
Nance
;
only
think
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
child
,
'
said
the
girl
,
suddenly
looking
up
,
`
is
better
where
he
*NL*
is
,
than
among
us
;
and
if
no
harm
comes
to
Bill
from
it
,
I
hope
he
lies
*NL*
dead
in
the
ditch
and
that
his
young
bones
may
rot
there
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
!
'
cried
the
Jew
,
in
amazement
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ay
,
I
do
,
'
returned
the
girl
,
meeting
his
gaze
.
'
I
shall
be
glad
to
*NL*
have
him
away
from
my
eyes
,
and
to
know
that
the
worst
is
over
.
I
*NL*
ca
n't
bear
to
have
him
about
me
.
The
sight
of
him
turns
me
against
*NL*
myself
,
and
all
of
you
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Pooh
!
'
said
the
Jew
,
scornfully
.
`
You
're
drunk
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Am
I
?
'
cried
the
girl
bitterly
.
`
It
's
no
fault
of
yours
,
if
I
am
not
!
*NL*
You
'd
never
have
me
anything
else
,
if
you
had
your
will
,
except
*NL*
now
;
--
the
humour
does
n't
suit
you
,
does
n't
it
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
!
'
rejoined
the
Jew
,
furiously
.
`
It
does
not
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Change
it
,
then
!
'
responded
the
girl
,
with
a
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Change
it
!
'
exclaimed
the
Jew
,
exasperated
beyond
all
bounds
by
his
*NL*
companion
's
unexpected
obstinacy
,
and
the
vexation
of
the
night
,
'
I
*NL*
_
will
_
change
it
!
Listen
to
me
,
you
drab
.
Listen
to
me
,
who
with
six
*NL*
words
,
can
strangle
Sikes
as
surely
as
if
I
had
his
bull
's
throat
*NL*
between
my
fingers
now
.
If
he
comes
back
,
and
leaves
the
boy
behind
*NL*
him
;
if
he
gets
off
free
,
and
dead
or
alive
,
fails
to
restore
him
to
*NL*
me
;
murder
him
yourself
if
you
would
have
him
escape
Jack
Ketch
.
And
*NL*
do
it
the
moment
he
sets
foot
in
this
room
,
or
mind
me
,
it
will
be
too
*NL*
late
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
is
all
this
?
'
cried
the
girl
involuntarily
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
is
it
?
'
pursued
Fagin
,
mad
with
rage
.
`
When
the
boy
's
worth
*NL*
hundreds
of
pounds
to
me
,
am
I
to
lose
what
chance
threw
me
in
the
way
*NL*
of
getting
safely
,
through
the
whims
of
a
drunken
gang
that
I
could
*NL*
whistle
away
the
lives
of
!
And
me
bound
,
too
,
to
a
born
devil
that
*NL*
only
wants
the
will
,
and
has
the
power
to
,
to
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
Panting
for
breath
,
the
old
man
stammered
for
a
word
;
and
in
that
*NL*
instant
checked
the
torrent
of
his
wrath
,
and
changed
his
whole
*NL*
demeanour
.
A
moment
before
,
his
clenched
hands
had
grasped
the
air
;
*NL*
his
eyes
had
dilated
;
and
his
face
grown
livid
with
passion
;
but
now
,
*NL*
he
shrunk
into
a
chair
,
and
,
cowering
together
,
trembled
with
the
*NL*
apprehension
of
having
himself
disclosed
some
hidden
villainy
.
After
a
*NL*
short
silence
,
he
ventured
to
look
round
at
his
companion
.
He
appeared
*NL*
somewhat
reassured
,
on
beholding
her
in
the
same
listless
attitude
from
*NL*
which
he
had
first
roused
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Nancy
,
dear
!
'
croaked
the
Jew
,
in
his
usual
voice
.
`
Did
you
mind
me
,
*NL*
dear
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Do
n't
worry
me
now
,
Fagin
!
'
replied
the
girl
,
raising
her
head
*NL*
languidly
.
`
If
Bill
has
not
done
it
this
time
,
he
will
another
.
He
has
*NL*
done
many
a
good
job
for
you
,
and
will
do
many
more
when
he
can
;
and
*NL*
when
he
ca
n't
he
wo
n't
;
so
no
more
about
that
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Regarding
this
boy
,
my
dear
?
'
said
the
Jew
,
rubbing
the
palms
of
his
*NL*
hands
nervously
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
boy
must
take
his
chance
with
the
rest
,
'
interrupted
Nancy
,
*NL*
hastily
;
`
and
I
say
again
,
I
hope
he
is
dead
,
and
out
of
harm
's
way
,
*NL*
and
out
of
yours
,
--
that
is
,
if
Bill
comes
to
no
harm
.
And
if
Toby
got
*NL*
clear
off
,
Bill
's
pretty
sure
to
be
safe
;
for
Bill
's
worth
two
of
Toby
*NL*
any
time
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
about
what
I
was
saying
,
my
dear
?
'
observed
the
Jew
,
keeping
his
*NL*
glistening
eye
steadily
upon
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Your
must
say
it
all
over
again
,
if
it
's
anything
you
want
me
to
do
,
'
*NL*
rejoined
Nancy
;
`
and
if
it
is
,
you
had
better
wait
till
to-morrow
.
You
*NL*
put
me
up
for
a
minute
;
but
now
I
'm
stupid
again
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Fagin
put
several
other
questions
:
all
with
the
same
drift
of
*NL*
ascertaining
whether
the
girl
had
profited
by
his
unguarded
hints
;
but
,
*NL*
she
answered
them
so
readily
,
and
was
withal
so
utterly
unmoved
by
his
*NL*
searching
looks
,
that
his
original
impression
of
her
being
more
than
a
*NL*
trifle
in
liquor
,
was
confirmed
.
Nancy
,
indeed
,
was
not
exempt
from
a
*NL*
failing
which
was
very
common
among
the
Jew
's
female
pupils
;
and
in
*NL*
which
,
in
their
tenderer
years
,
they
were
rather
encouraged
than
*NL*
checked
.
Her
disordered
appearance
,
and
a
wholesale
perfume
of
Geneva
*NL*
which
pervaded
the
apartment
,
afforded
strong
confirmatory
evidence
of
*NL*
the
justice
of
the
Jew
's
supposition
;
and
when
,
after
indulging
in
the
*NL*
temporary
display
of
violence
above
described
,
she
subsided
,
first
into
*NL*
dullness
,
and
afterwards
into
a
compound
of
feelings
:
under
the
*NL*
influence
of
which
she
shed
tears
one
minute
,
and
in
the
next
gave
*NL*
utterance
to
various
exclamations
of
`
Never
say
die
!
'
and
divers
*NL*
calculations
as
to
what
might
be
the
amount
of
the
odds
so
long
as
a
*NL*
lady
or
gentleman
was
happy
,
Mr.
Fagin
,
who
had
had
considerable
*NL*
experience
of
such
matters
in
his
time
,
saw
,
with
great
satisfaction
,
*NL*
that
she
was
very
far
gone
indeed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
eased
his
mind
by
this
discovery
;
and
having
accomplished
his
*NL*
twofold
object
of
imparting
to
the
girl
what
he
had
,
that
night
,
heard
,
*NL*
and
of
ascertaining
,
with
his
own
eyes
,
that
Sikes
had
not
returned
,
*NL*
Mr.
Fagin
again
turned
his
face
homeward
:
leaving
his
young
friend
*NL*
asleep
,
with
her
head
upon
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
within
an
hour
of
midnight
.
The
weather
being
dark
,
and
*NL*
piercing
cold
,
he
had
no
great
temptation
to
loiter
.
The
sharp
wind
*NL*
that
scoured
the
streets
,
seemed
to
have
cleared
them
of
passengers
,
as
*NL*
of
dust
and
mud
,
for
few
people
were
abroad
,
and
they
were
to
all
*NL*
appearance
hastening
fast
home
.
It
blew
from
the
right
quarter
for
the
*NL*
Jew
,
however
,
and
straight
before
it
he
went
:
trembling
,
and
shivering
,
*NL*
as
every
fresh
gust
drove
him
rudely
on
his
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
reached
the
corner
of
his
own
street
,
and
was
already
fumbling
*NL*
in
his
pocket
for
the
door-key
,
when
a
dark
figure
emerged
from
a
*NL*
projecting
entrance
which
lay
in
deep
shadow
,
and
,
crossing
the
road
,
*NL*
glided
up
to
him
unperceived
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Fagin
!
'
whispered
a
voice
close
to
his
ear
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ah
!
'
said
the
Jew
,
turning
quickly
round
,
`
is
that
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
!
'
interrupted
the
stranger
.
'
I
have
been
lingering
here
these
two
*NL*
hours
.
Where
the
devil
have
you
been
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
On
your
business
,
my
dear
,
'
replied
the
Jew
,
glancing
uneasily
at
his
*NL*
companion
,
and
slackening
his
pace
as
he
spoke
.
`
On
your
business
all
*NL*
night
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
,
of
course
!
'
said
the
stranger
,
with
a
sneer
.
`
Well
;
and
what
's
*NL*
come
of
it
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Nothing
good
,
'
said
the
Jew
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Nothing
bad
,
I
hope
?
'
said
the
stranger
,
stopping
short
,
and
turning
a
*NL*
startled
look
on
his
companion
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Jew
shook
his
head
,
and
was
about
to
reply
,
when
the
stranger
,
*NL*
interrupting
him
,
motioned
to
the
house
,
before
which
they
had
by
this
*NL*
time
arrived
:
remarking
,
that
he
had
better
say
what
he
had
got
to
*NL*
say
,
under
cover
:
for
his
blood
was
chilled
with
standing
about
so
*NL*
long
,
and
the
wind
blew
through
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fagin
looked
as
if
he
could
have
willingly
excused
himself
from
taking
*NL*
home
a
visitor
at
that
unseasonable
hour
;
and
,
indeed
,
muttered
*NL*
something
about
having
no
fire
;
but
his
companion
repeating
his
request
*NL*
in
a
peremptory
manner
,
he
unlocked
the
door
,
and
requested
him
to
*NL*
close
it
softly
,
while
he
got
a
light
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
's
as
dark
as
the
grave
,
'
said
the
man
,
groping
forward
a
few
steps
.
*NL*
`
Make
haste
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Shut
the
door
,
'
whispered
Fagin
from
the
end
of
the
passage
.
As
he
*NL*
spoke
,
it
closed
with
a
loud
noise
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
was
n't
my
doing
,
'
said
the
other
man
,
feeling
his
way
.
`
The
wind
*NL*
blew
it
to
,
or
it
shut
of
its
own
accord
:
one
or
the
other
.
Look
sharp
*NL*
with
the
light
,
or
I
shall
knock
my
brains
out
against
something
in
*NL*
this
confounded
hole
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Fagin
stealthily
descended
the
kitchen
stairs
.
After
a
short
absence
,
*NL*
he
returned
with
a
lighted
candle
,
and
the
intelligence
that
Toby
*NL*
Crackit
was
asleep
in
the
back
room
below
,
and
that
the
boys
were
in
*NL*
the
front
one
.
Beckoning
the
man
to
follow
him
,
he
led
the
way
*NL*
upstairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
We
can
say
the
few
words
we
've
got
to
say
in
here
,
my
dear
,
'
said
the
*NL*
Jew
,
throwing
open
a
door
on
the
first
floor
;
`
and
as
there
are
holes
*NL*
in
the
shutters
,
and
we
never
show
lights
to
our
neighbours
,
we
'll
set
*NL*
the
candle
on
the
stairs
.
There
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
With
those
words
,
the
Jew
,
stooping
down
,
placed
the
candle
on
an
upper
*NL*
flight
of
stairs
,
exactly
opposite
to
the
room
door
.
This
done
,
he
led
*NL*
the
way
into
the
apartment
;
which
was
destitute
of
all
movables
save
a
*NL*
broken
arm-chair
,
and
an
old
couch
or
sofa
without
covering
,
which
*NL*
stood
behind
the
door
.
Upon
this
piece
of
furniture
,
the
stranger
sat
*NL*
himself
with
the
air
of
a
weary
man
;
and
the
Jew
,
drawing
up
the
*NL*
arm-chair
opposite
,
they
sat
face
to
face
.
It
was
not
quite
dark
;
the
*NL*
door
was
partially
open
;
and
the
candle
outside
,
threw
a
feeble
*NL*
reflection
on
the
opposite
wall
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
conversed
for
some
time
in
whispers
.
Though
nothing
of
the
*NL*
conversation
was
distinguishable
beyond
a
few
disjointed
words
here
and
*NL*
there
,
a
listener
might
easily
have
perceived
that
Fagin
appeared
to
be
*NL*
defending
himself
against
some
remarks
of
the
stranger
;
and
that
the
*NL*
latter
was
in
a
state
of
considerable
irritation
.
They
might
have
been
*NL*
talking
,
thus
,
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
or
more
,
when
Monks
--
by
which
*NL*
name
the
Jew
had
designated
the
strange
man
several
times
in
the
course
*NL*
of
their
colloquy
--
said
,
raising
his
voice
a
little
,
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
tell
you
again
,
it
was
badly
planned
.
Why
not
have
kept
him
here
*NL*
among
the
rest
,
and
made
a
sneaking
,
snivelling
pickpocket
of
him
at
*NL*
once
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Only
hear
him
!
'
exclaimed
the
Jew
,
shrugging
his
shoulders
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
do
you
mean
to
say
you
could
n't
have
done
it
,
if
you
had
chosen
?
'
*NL*
demanded
Monks
,
sternly
.
`
Have
n't
you
done
it
,
with
other
boys
,
scores
*NL*
of
times
?
If
you
had
had
patience
for
a
twelvemonth
,
at
most
,
could
n't
*NL*
you
have
got
him
convicted
,
and
sent
safely
out
of
the
kingdom
;
perhaps
*NL*
for
life
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Whose
turn
would
that
have
served
,
my
dear
?
'
inquired
the
Jew
humbly
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Mine
,
'
replied
Monks
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
not
mine
,
'
said
the
Jew
,
submissively
.
`
He
might
have
become
of
*NL*
use
to
me
.
When
there
are
two
parties
to
a
bargain
,
it
is
only
*NL*
reasonable
that
the
interests
of
both
should
be
consulted
;
is
it
,
my
*NL*
good
friend
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
then
?
'
demanded
Monks
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
saw
it
was
not
easy
to
train
him
to
the
business
,
'
replied
the
Jew
;
*NL*
`
he
was
not
like
other
boys
in
the
same
circumstances
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Curse
him
,
no
!
'
muttered
the
man
,
`
or
he
would
have
been
a
thief
,
long
*NL*
ago
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
had
no
hold
upon
him
to
make
him
worse
,
'
pursued
the
Jew
,
anxiously
*NL*
watching
the
countenance
of
his
companion
.
`
His
hand
was
not
in
.
I
*NL*
had
nothing
to
frighten
him
with
;
which
we
always
must
have
in
the
*NL*
beginning
,
or
we
labour
in
vain
.
What
could
I
do
?
Send
him
out
with
*NL*
the
Dodger
and
Charley
?
We
had
enough
of
that
,
at
first
,
my
dear
;
I
*NL*
trembled
for
us
all
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
_
That
_
was
not
my
doing
,
'
observed
Monks
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
no
,
my
dear
!
'
renewed
the
Jew
.
`
And
I
do
n't
quarrel
with
it
now
;
*NL*
because
,
if
it
had
never
happened
,
you
might
never
have
clapped
eyes
on
*NL*
the
boy
to
notice
him
,
and
so
led
to
the
discovery
that
it
was
him
you
*NL*
were
looking
for
.
Well
!
I
got
him
back
for
you
by
means
of
the
girl
;
*NL*
and
then
_
she
_
begins
to
favour
him
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Throttle
the
girl
!
'
said
Monks
,
impatiently
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
we
ca
n't
afford
to
do
that
just
now
,
my
dear
,
'
replied
the
Jew
,
*NL*
smiling
;
`
and
,
besides
,
that
sort
of
thing
is
not
in
our
way
;
or
,
one
*NL*
of
these
days
,
I
might
be
glad
to
have
it
done
.
I
know
what
these
*NL*
girls
are
,
Monks
,
well
.
As
soon
as
the
boy
begins
to
harden
,
she
'll
*NL*
care
no
more
for
him
,
than
for
a
block
of
wood
.
You
want
him
made
a
*NL*
thief
.
If
he
is
alive
,
I
can
make
him
one
from
this
time
;
and
,
*NL*
if
--
if
--
'
said
the
Jew
,
drawing
nearer
to
the
other
,
--
`
it
's
not
likely
,
*NL*
mind
,
--
but
if
the
worst
comes
to
the
worst
,
and
he
is
dead
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
's
no
fault
of
mine
if
he
is
!
'
interposed
the
other
man
,
with
a
look
*NL*
of
terror
,
and
clasping
the
Jew
's
arm
with
trembling
hands
.
`
Mind
*NL*
that
.
Fagin
!
I
had
no
hand
in
it
.
Anything
but
his
death
,
I
told
you
*NL*
from
the
first
.
I
wo
n't
shed
blood
;
it
's
always
found
out
,
and
haunts
*NL*
a
man
besides
.
If
they
shot
him
dead
,
I
was
not
the
cause
;
do
you
hear
*NL*
me
?
Fire
this
infernal
den
!
What
's
that
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
!
'
cried
the
Jew
,
grasping
the
coward
round
the
body
,
with
both
*NL*
arms
,
as
he
sprung
to
his
feet
.
`
Where
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yonder
!
replied
the
man
,
glaring
at
the
opposite
wall
.
`
The
shadow
!
*NL*
I
saw
the
shadow
of
a
woman
,
in
a
cloak
and
bonnet
,
pass
along
the
*NL*
wainscot
like
a
breath
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
Jew
released
his
hold
,
and
they
rushed
tumultuously
from
the
room
.
*NL*
The
candle
,
wasted
by
the
draught
,
was
standing
where
it
had
been
*NL*
placed
.
It
showed
them
only
the
empty
staircase
,
and
their
own
white
*NL*
faces
.
They
listened
intently
:
a
profound
silence
reigned
throughout
*NL*
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
's
your
fancy
,
'
said
the
Jew
,
taking
up
the
light
and
turning
to
his
*NL*
companion
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
'll
swear
I
saw
it
!
'
replied
Monks
,
trembling
.
`
It
was
bending
*NL*
forward
when
I
saw
it
first
;
and
when
I
spoke
,
it
darted
away
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
Jew
glanced
contemptuously
at
the
pale
face
of
his
associate
,
and
,
*NL*
telling
him
he
could
follow
,
if
he
pleased
,
ascended
the
stairs
.
They
*NL*
looked
into
all
the
rooms
;
they
were
cold
,
bare
,
and
empty
.
They
*NL*
descended
into
the
passage
,
and
thence
into
the
cellars
below
.
The
*NL*
green
damp
hung
upon
the
low
walls
;
the
tracks
of
the
snail
and
slug
*NL*
glistened
in
the
light
of
the
candle
;
but
all
was
still
as
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
do
you
think
now
?
'
said
the
Jew
,
when
they
had
regained
the
*NL*
passage
.
`
Besides
ourselves
,
there
's
not
a
creature
in
the
house
*NL*
except
Toby
and
the
boys
;
and
they
're
safe
enough
.
See
here
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
As
a
proof
of
the
fact
,
the
Jew
drew
forth
two
keys
from
his
pocket
;
*NL*
and
explained
,
that
when
he
first
went
downstairs
,
he
had
locked
them
*NL*
in
,
to
prevent
any
intrusion
on
the
conference
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
accumulated
testimony
effectually
staggered
Mr.
Monks
.
His
*NL*
protestations
had
gradually
become
less
and
less
vehement
as
they
*NL*
proceeded
in
their
search
without
making
any
discovery
;
and
,
now
,
he
*NL*
gave
vent
to
several
very
grim
laughs
,
and
confessed
it
could
only
have
*NL*
been
his
excited
imagination
.
He
declined
any
renewal
of
the
*NL*
conversation
,
however
,
for
that
night
:
suddenly
remembering
that
it
*NL*
was
past
one
o'clock
.
And
so
the
amiable
couple
parted
.

CHAPTER
XXVII
*NL*
*NL*
ATONES
FOR
THE
UNPOLITENESS
OF
A
FORMER
CHAPTER
;
WHICH
DESERTED
A
LADY
,
*NL*
MOST
UNCEREMONIOUSLY
*NL*
*NL*
As
it
would
be
,
by
no
means
,
seemly
in
a
humble
author
to
keep
so
*NL*
mighty
a
personage
as
a
beadle
waiting
,
with
his
back
to
the
fire
,
and
*NL*
the
skirts
of
his
coat
gathered
up
under
his
arms
,
until
such
time
as
*NL*
it
might
suit
his
pleasure
to
relieve
him
;
and
as
it
would
still
less
*NL*
become
his
station
,
or
his
gallantry
to
involve
in
the
same
neglect
a
*NL*
lady
on
whom
that
beadle
had
looked
with
an
eye
of
tenderness
and
*NL*
affection
,
and
in
whose
ear
he
had
whispered
sweet
words
,
which
,
coming
*NL*
from
such
a
quarter
,
might
well
thrill
the
bosom
of
maid
or
matron
of
*NL*
whatsoever
degree
;
the
historian
whose
pen
traces
these
words
--
trusting
*NL*
that
he
knows
his
place
,
and
that
he
entertains
a
becoming
reverence
*NL*
for
those
upon
earth
to
whom
high
and
important
authority
is
*NL*
delegated
--
hastens
to
pay
them
that
respect
which
their
position
*NL*
demands
,
and
to
treat
them
with
all
that
duteous
ceremony
which
their
*NL*
exalted
rank
,
and
-LRB-
by
consequence
-RRB-
great
virtues
,
imperatively
claim
at
*NL*
his
hands
.
Towards
this
end
,
indeed
,
he
had
purposed
to
introduce
,
in
*NL*
this
place
,
a
dissertation
touching
the
divine
right
of
beadles
,
and
*NL*
elucidative
of
the
position
,
that
a
beadle
can
do
no
wrong
:
which
*NL*
could
not
fail
to
have
been
both
pleasurable
and
profitable
to
the
*NL*
right-minded
reader
but
which
he
is
unfortunately
compelled
,
by
want
of
*NL*
time
and
space
,
to
postpone
to
some
more
convenient
and
fitting
*NL*
opportunity
;
on
the
arrival
of
which
,
he
will
be
prepared
to
show
,
that
*NL*
a
beadle
properly
constituted
:
that
is
to
say
,
a
parochial
beadle
,
*NL*
attached
to
a
parochial
workhouse
,
and
attending
in
his
official
*NL*
capacity
the
parochial
church
:
is
,
in
right
and
virtue
of
his
office
,
*NL*
possessed
of
all
the
excellences
and
best
qualities
of
humanity
;
and
*NL*
that
to
none
of
those
excellences
,
can
mere
companies
'
beadles
,
or
*NL*
court-of-law
beadles
,
or
even
chapel-of-ease
beadles
-LRB-
save
the
last
,
*NL*
and
they
in
a
very
lowly
and
inferior
degree
-RRB-
,
lay
the
remotest
*NL*
sustainable
claim
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bumble
had
re-counted
the
teaspoons
,
re-weighed
the
sugar-tongs
,
*NL*
made
a
closer
inspection
of
the
milk-pot
,
and
ascertained
to
a
nicety
*NL*
the
exact
condition
of
the
furniture
,
down
to
the
very
horse-hair
seats
*NL*
of
the
chairs
;
and
had
repeated
each
process
full
half
a
dozen
times
;
*NL*
before
he
began
to
think
that
it
was
time
for
Mrs.
Corney
to
return
.
*NL*
Thinking
begets
thinking
;
as
there
were
no
sounds
of
Mrs.
Corney
's
*NL*
approach
,
it
occured
to
Mr.
Bumble
that
it
would
be
an
innocent
and
*NL*
virtuous
way
of
spending
the
time
,
if
he
were
further
to
allay
his
*NL*
curiousity
by
a
cursory
glance
at
the
interior
of
Mrs.
Corney
's
chest
*NL*
of
drawers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
listened
at
the
keyhole
,
to
assure
himself
that
nobody
was
*NL*
approaching
the
chamber
,
Mr.
Bumble
,
beginning
at
the
bottom
,
proceeded
*NL*
to
make
himself
acquainted
with
the
contents
of
the
three
long
drawers
:
*NL*
which
,
being
filled
with
various
garments
of
good
fashion
and
texture
,
*NL*
carefully
preserved
between
two
layers
of
old
newspapers
,
speckled
with
*NL*
dried
lavender
:
seemed
to
yield
him
exceeding
satisfaction
.
Arriving
,
*NL*
in
course
of
time
,
at
the
right-hand
corner
drawer
-LRB-
in
which
was
the
*NL*
key
-RRB-
,
and
beholding
therein
a
small
padlocked
box
,
which
,
being
shaken
,
*NL*
gave
forth
a
pleasant
sound
,
as
of
the
chinking
of
coin
,
Mr.
Bumble
*NL*
returned
with
a
stately
walk
to
the
fireplace
;
and
,
resuming
his
old
*NL*
attitude
,
said
,
with
a
grave
and
determined
air
,
`
I
'll
do
it
!
'
He
*NL*
followed
up
this
remarkable
declaration
,
by
shaking
his
head
in
a
*NL*
waggish
manner
for
ten
minutes
,
as
though
he
were
remonstrating
with
*NL*
himself
for
being
such
a
pleasant
dog
;
and
then
,
he
took
a
view
of
his
*NL*
legs
in
profile
,
with
much
seeming
pleasure
and
interest
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
still
placidly
engaged
in
this
latter
survey
,
when
Mrs.
Corney
,
*NL*
hurrying
into
the
room
,
threw
herself
,
in
a
breathless
state
,
on
a
*NL*
chair
by
the
fireside
,
and
covering
her
eyes
with
one
hand
,
placed
the
*NL*
other
over
her
heart
,
and
gasped
for
breath
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Mrs.
Corney
,
'
said
Mr.
Bumble
,
stooping
over
the
matron
,
`
what
is
*NL*
this
,
ma'am
?
Has
anything
happened
,
ma'am
?
Pray
answer
me
:
I
'm
*NL*
on
--
on
--
'
Mr.
Bumble
,
in
his
alarm
,
could
not
immediately
think
of
the
*NL*
word
`
tenterhooks
,
'
so
he
said
`
broken
bottles
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
,
Mr.
Bumble
!
'
cried
the
lady
,
'
I
have
been
so
dreadfully
put
out
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Put
out
,
ma'am
!
'
exclaimed
Mr.
Bumble
;
`
who
has
dared
to
--
?
I
know
!
'
*NL*
said
Mr.
Bumble
,
checking
himself
,
with
native
majesty
,
`
this
is
them
*NL*
wicious
paupers
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
's
dreadful
to
think
of
!
'
said
the
lady
,
shuddering
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Then
_
do
n't
_
think
of
it
,
ma'am
,
'
rejoined
Mr.
Bumble
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
ca
n't
help
it
,
'
whimpered
the
lady
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Then
take
something
,
ma'am
,
'
said
Mr.
Bumble
soothingly
.
'
A
little
of
*NL*
the
wine
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Not
for
the
world
!
'
replied
Mrs.
Corney
.
'
I
could
n't
,
--
oh
!
The
top
*NL*
shelf
in
the
right-hand
corner
--
oh
!
'
Uttering
these
words
,
the
good
*NL*
lady
pointed
,
distractedly
,
to
the
cupboard
,
and
underwent
a
convulsion
*NL*
from
internal
spasms
.
Mr.
Bumble
rushed
to
the
closet
;
and
,
snatching
*NL*
a
pint
green-glass
bottle
from
the
shelf
thus
incoherently
indicated
,
*NL*
filled
a
tea-cup
with
its
contents
,
and
held
it
to
the
lady
's
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
'm
better
now
,
'
said
Mrs.
Corney
,
falling
back
,
after
drinking
half
*NL*
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bumble
raised
his
eyes
piously
to
the
ceiling
in
thankfulness
;
and
,
*NL*
bringing
them
down
again
to
the
brim
of
the
cup
,
lifted
it
to
his
nose
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Peppermint
,
'
exclaimed
Mrs.
Corney
,
in
a
faint
voice
,
smiling
gently
*NL*
on
the
beadle
as
she
spoke
.
`
Try
it
!
There
's
a
little
--
a
little
*NL*
something
else
in
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bumble
tasted
the
medicine
with
a
doubtful
look
;
smacked
his
lips
;
*NL*
took
another
taste
;
and
put
the
cup
down
empty
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
's
very
comforting
,
'
said
Mrs.
Corney
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Very
much
so
indeed
,
ma'am
,
'
said
the
beadle
.
As
he
spoke
,
he
drew
a
*NL*
chair
beside
the
matron
,
and
tenderly
inquired
what
had
happened
to
*NL*
distress
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Nothing
,
'
replied
Mrs.
Corney
.
'
I
am
a
foolish
,
excitable
,
weak
*NL*
creetur
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Not
weak
,
ma'am
,
'
retorted
Mr.
Bumble
,
drawing
his
chair
a
little
*NL*
closer
.
`
Are
you
a
weak
creetur
,
Mrs.
Corney
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
We
are
all
weak
creeturs
,
'
said
Mrs.
Corney
,
laying
down
a
general
*NL*
principle
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
So
we
are
,
'
said
the
beadle
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
was
said
on
either
side
,
for
a
minute
or
two
afterwards
.
By
the
*NL*
expiration
of
that
time
,
Mr.
Bumble
had
illustrated
the
position
by
*NL*
removing
his
left
arm
from
the
back
of
Mrs.
Corney
's
chair
,
where
it
*NL*
had
previously
rested
,
to
Mrs.
Corney
's
apron-string
,
round
which
it
*NL*
gradually
became
entwined
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
We
are
all
weak
creeturs
,
'
said
Mr.
Bumble
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Corney
sighed
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Do
n't
sigh
,
Mrs.
Corney
,
'
said
Mr.
Bumble
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
ca
n't
help
it
,
'
said
Mrs.
Corney
.
And
she
sighed
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
This
is
a
very
comfortable
room
,
ma'am
,
'
said
Mr.
Bumble
looking
*NL*
round
.
`
Another
room
,
and
this
,
ma'am
,
would
be
a
complete
thing
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
would
be
too
much
for
one
,
'
murmured
the
lady
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
not
for
two
,
ma'am
,
'
rejoined
Mr.
Bumble
,
in
soft
accents
.
`
Eh
,
*NL*
Mrs.
Corney
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Corney
drooped
her
head
,
when
the
beadle
said
this
;
the
beadle
*NL*
drooped
his
,
to
get
a
view
of
Mrs.
Corney
's
face
.
Mrs.
Corney
,
with
*NL*
great
propriety
,
turned
her
head
away
,
and
released
her
hand
to
get
at
*NL*
her
pocket-handkerchief
;
but
insensibly
replaced
it
in
that
of
Mr.
*NL*
Bumble
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
board
allows
you
coals
,
do
n't
they
,
Mrs.
Corney
?
'
inquired
the
*NL*
beadle
,
affectionately
pressing
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
candles
,
'
replied
Mrs.
Corney
,
slightly
returning
the
pressure
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Coals
,
candles
,
and
house-rent
free
,
'
said
Mr.
Bumble
.
`
Oh
,
Mrs.
*NL*
Corney
,
what
an
Angel
you
are
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
lady
was
not
proof
against
this
burst
of
feeling
.
She
sank
into
*NL*
Mr.
Bumble
's
arms
;
and
that
gentleman
in
his
agitation
,
imprinted
a
*NL*
passionate
kiss
upon
her
chaste
nose
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Such
porochial
perfection
!
'
exclaimed
Mr.
Bumble
,
rapturously
.
`
You
*NL*
know
that
Mr.
Slout
is
worse
to-night
,
my
fascinator
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
'
replied
Mrs.
Corney
,
bashfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
ca
n't
live
a
week
,
the
doctor
says
,
'
pursued
Mr.
Bumble
.
`
He
is
the
*NL*
master
of
this
establishment
;
his
death
will
cause
a
wacancy
;
that
*NL*
wacancy
must
be
filled
up
.
Oh
,
Mrs.
Corney
,
what
a
prospect
this
*NL*
opens
!
What
a
opportunity
for
a
jining
of
hearts
and
housekeepings
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Corney
sobbed
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
little
word
?
'
said
Mr.
Bumble
,
bending
over
the
bashful
beauty
.
*NL*
`
The
one
little
,
little
,
little
word
,
my
blessed
Corney
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ye
--
ye
--
yes
!
'
sighed
out
the
matron
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
One
more
,
'
pursued
the
beadle
;
`
compose
your
darling
feelings
for
only
*NL*
one
more
.
When
is
it
to
come
off
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Corney
twice
essayed
to
speak
:
and
twice
failed
.
At
length
*NL*
summoning
up
courage
,
she
threw
her
arms
around
Mr.
Bumble
's
neck
,
and
*NL*
said
,
it
might
be
as
soon
as
ever
he
pleased
,
and
that
he
was
'
a
*NL*
irresistible
duck
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Matters
being
thus
amicably
and
satisfactorily
arranged
,
the
contract
*NL*
was
solemnly
ratified
in
another
teacupful
of
the
peppermint
mixture
;
*NL*
which
was
rendered
the
more
necessary
,
by
the
flutter
and
agitation
of
*NL*
the
lady
's
spirits
.
While
it
was
being
disposed
of
,
she
acquainted
Mr.
*NL*
Bumble
with
the
old
woman
's
decease
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Very
good
,
'
said
that
gentleman
,
sipping
his
peppermint
;
`
I
'll
call
at
*NL*
Sowerberry
's
as
I
go
home
,
and
tell
him
to
send
to-morrow
morning
.
Was
*NL*
it
that
as
frightened
you
,
love
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
was
n't
anything
particular
,
dear
,
'
said
the
lady
evasively
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
must
have
been
something
,
love
,
'
urged
Mr.
Bumble
.
`
Wo
n't
you
tell
*NL*
your
own
B.
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Not
now
,
'
rejoined
the
lady
;
`
one
of
these
days
.
After
we
're
married
,
*NL*
dear
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
After
we
're
married
!
'
exclaimed
Mr.
Bumble
.
`
It
was
n't
any
impudence
*NL*
from
any
of
them
male
paupers
as
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
no
,
love
!
'
interposed
the
lady
,
hastily
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
If
I
thought
it
was
,
'
continued
Mr.
Bumble
;
`
if
I
thought
as
any
one
*NL*
of
'em
had
dared
to
lift
his
wulgar
eyes
to
that
lovely
countenance
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
They
would
n't
have
dared
to
do
it
,
love
,
'
responded
the
lady
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
They
had
better
not
!
'
said
Mr.
Bumble
,
clenching
his
fist
.
`
Let
me
see
*NL*
any
man
,
porochial
or
extra-porochial
,
as
would
presume
to
do
it
;
and
I
*NL*
can
tell
him
that
he
would
n't
do
it
a
second
time
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Unembellished
by
any
violence
of
gesticulation
,
this
might
have
seemed
*NL*
no
very
high
compliment
to
the
lady
's
charms
;
but
,
as
Mr.
Bumble
*NL*
accompanied
the
threat
with
many
warlike
gestures
,
she
was
much
touched
*NL*
with
this
proof
of
his
devotion
,
and
protested
,
with
great
admiration
,
*NL*
that
he
was
indeed
a
dove
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
dove
then
turned
up
his
coat-collar
,
and
put
on
his
cocked
hat
;
*NL*
and
,
having
exchanged
a
long
and
affectionate
embrace
with
his
future
*NL*
partner
,
once
again
braved
the
cold
wind
of
the
night
:
merely
pausing
,
*NL*
for
a
few
minutes
,
in
the
male
paupers
'
ward
,
to
abuse
them
a
little
,
*NL*
with
the
view
of
satisfying
himself
that
he
could
fill
the
office
of
*NL*
workhouse-master
with
needful
acerbity
.
Assured
of
his
qualifications
,
*NL*
Mr.
Bumble
left
the
building
with
a
light
heart
,
and
bright
visions
of
*NL*
his
future
promotion
:
which
served
to
occupy
his
mind
until
he
reached
*NL*
the
shop
of
the
undertaker
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Sowerberry
having
gone
out
to
tea
and
supper
:
and
*NL*
Noah
Claypole
not
being
at
any
time
disposed
to
take
upon
himself
a
*NL*
greater
amount
of
physical
exertion
than
is
necessary
to
a
convenient
*NL*
performance
of
the
two
functions
of
eating
and
drinking
,
the
shop
was
*NL*
not
closed
,
although
it
was
past
the
usual
hour
of
shutting-up
.
Mr.
*NL*
Bumble
tapped
with
his
cane
on
the
counter
several
times
;
but
,
*NL*
attracting
no
attention
,
and
beholding
a
light
shining
through
the
*NL*
glass-window
of
the
little
parlour
at
the
back
of
the
shop
,
he
made
*NL*
bold
to
peep
in
and
see
what
was
going
forward
;
and
when
he
saw
what
*NL*
was
going
forward
,
he
was
not
a
little
surprised
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cloth
was
laid
for
supper
;
the
table
was
covered
with
bread
and
*NL*
butter
,
plates
and
glasses
;
a
porter-pot
and
a
wine-bottle
.
At
the
*NL*
upper
end
of
the
table
,
Mr.
Noah
Claypole
lolled
negligently
in
an
*NL*
easy-chair
,
with
his
legs
thrown
over
one
of
the
arms
:
an
open
*NL*
clasp-knife
in
one
hand
,
and
a
mass
of
buttered
bread
in
the
other
.
*NL*
Close
beside
him
stood
Charlotte
,
opening
oysters
from
a
barrel
:
which
*NL*
Mr.
Claypole
condescended
to
swallow
,
with
remarkable
avidity
.
A
more
*NL*
than
ordinary
redness
in
the
region
of
the
young
gentleman
's
nose
,
and
*NL*
a
kind
of
fixed
wink
in
his
right
eye
,
denoted
that
he
was
in
a
slight
*NL*
degree
intoxicated
;
these
symptoms
were
confirmed
by
the
intense
relish
*NL*
with
which
he
took
his
oysters
,
for
which
nothing
but
a
strong
*NL*
appreciation
of
their
cooling
properties
,
in
cases
of
internal
fever
,
*NL*
could
have
sufficiently
accounted
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Here
's
a
delicious
fat
one
,
Noah
,
dear
!
'
said
Charlotte
;
`
try
him
,
do
;
*NL*
only
this
one
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
a
delicious
thing
is
a
oyster
!
'
remarked
Mr.
Claypole
,
after
he
*NL*
had
swallowed
it
.
`
What
a
pity
it
is
,
a
number
of
'em
should
ever
make
*NL*
you
feel
uncomfortable
;
is
n't
it
,
Charlotte
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
's
quite
a
cruelty
,
'
said
Charlotte
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
So
it
is
,
'
acquiesced
Mr.
Claypole
.
`
A
n't
yer
fond
of
oysters
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Not
overmuch
,
'
replied
Charlotte
.
'
I
like
to
see
you
eat
'em
,
Noah
*NL*
dear
,
better
than
eating
'em
myself
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Lor
!
'
said
Noah
,
reflectively
;
`
how
queer
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Have
another
,
'
said
Charlotte
.
`
Here
's
one
with
such
a
beautiful
,
*NL*
delicate
beard
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
ca
n't
manage
any
more
,
'
said
Noah
.
`
I
'm
very
sorry
.
Come
here
,
*NL*
Charlotte
,
and
I
'll
kiss
yer
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
!
'
said
Mr.
Bumble
,
bursting
into
the
room
.
`
Say
that
again
,
sir
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Charlotte
uttered
a
scream
,
and
hid
her
face
in
her
apron
.
Mr.
*NL*
Claypole
,
without
making
any
further
change
in
his
position
than
*NL*
suffering
his
legs
to
reach
the
ground
,
gazed
at
the
beadle
in
drunken
*NL*
terror
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Say
it
again
,
you
wile
,
owdacious
fellow
!
'
said
Mr.
Bumble
.
`
How
dare
*NL*
you
mention
such
a
thing
,
sir
?
And
how
dare
you
encourage
him
,
you
*NL*
insolent
minx
?
Kiss
her
!
'
exclaimed
Mr.
Bumble
,
in
strong
indignation
.
*NL*
`
Faugh
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
did
n't
mean
to
do
it
!
'
said
Noah
,
blubbering
.
`
She
's
always
*NL*
a-kissing
of
me
,
whether
I
like
it
,
or
not
.

`
Oh

cried
Charlotte
,
reproachfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yer

'
retorted
Noah
.
`
She
's
always

of
*NL*
it
,
Mr.
Bumble
,
sir
;
she
chucks
me
under
the
chin
,
please
,
sir
;
and
*NL*
makes
all
manner
of
love
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Silence
!
'
cried
Mr.
Bumble
,
sternly
.
`
Take
yourself
downstairs
,
*NL*
ma'am
.
Noah
,
you
shut
up
the
shop
;
say
another
word
till
your
master
*NL*
comes
home
,
at
your
peril
;
and
,
when
he
does
come
home
,
tell
him
that
*NL*
Mr.
Bumble
said
he
was
to
send
a
old
woman
's
shell
after
breakfast
*NL*
to-morrow
morning
.
Do
you
hear
sir
?
Kissing
!
'
cried
Mr.
Bumble
,
*NL*
holding
up
his
hands
.
`
The
sin
and
wickedness
of
the
lower
orders
in
*NL*
this
porochial
district
is
frightful
!
If
Parliament
do
n't
take
their
*NL*
abominable
courses
under
consideration
,
this
country
's
ruined
,
and
the
*NL*
character
of
the
peasantry
gone
for
ever
!
'
With
these
words
,
the
*NL*
beadle
strode
,
with
a
lofty
and
gloomy
air
,
from
the
undertaker
's
*NL*
premises
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
that
we
have
accompanied
him
so
far
on
his
road
home
,
and
have
*NL*
made
all
necessary
preparations
for
the
old
woman
's
funeral
,
let
us
set
*NL*
on
foot
a
few
inquires
after
young
Oliver
Twist
,
and
ascertain
whether
*NL*
he
be
still
lying
in
the
ditch
where
Toby
Crackit
left
him
.

CHAPTER
XXVIII
*NL*
*NL*
LOOKS
AFTER
OLIVER
,
AND
PROCEEDS
WITH
HIS
ADVENTURES
*NL*
*NL*
`
Wolves
tear
your
throats
!
'
muttered
Sikes
,
grinding
his
teeth
.
'
I
wish
*NL*
I
was
among
some
of
you
;
you
'd
howl
the
hoarser
for
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
As
Sikes
growled
forth
this
imprecation
,
with
the
most
desperate
*NL*
ferocity
that
his
desperate
nature
was
capable
of
,
he
rested
the
body
*NL*
of
the
wounded
boy
across
his
bended
knee
;
and
turned
his
head
,
for
an
*NL*
instant
,
to
look
back
at
his
pursuers
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
little
to
be
made
out
,
in
the
mist
and
darkness
;
but
the
loud
*NL*
shouting
of
men
vibrated
through
the
air
,
and
the
barking
of
the
*NL*
neighbouring
dogs
,
roused
by
the
sound
of
the
alarm
bell
,
resounded
in
*NL*
every
direction
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Stop
,
you
white-livered
hound
!
'
cried
the
robber
,
shouting
after
Toby
*NL*
Crackit
,
who
,
making
the
best
use
of
his
long
legs
,
was
already
ahead
.
*NL*
`
Stop
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
repetition
of
the
word
,
brought
Toby
to
a
dead
stand-still
.
For
he
*NL*
was
not
quite
satisfied
that
he
was
beyond
the
range
of
pistol-shot
;
*NL*
and
Sikes
was
in
no
mood
to
be
played
with
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Bear
a
hand
with
the
boy
,
'
cried
Sikes
,
beckoning
furiously
to
his
*NL*
confederate
.
`
Come
back
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Toby
made
a
show
of
returning
;
but
ventured
,
in
a
low
voice
,
broken
for
*NL*
want
of
breath
,
to
intimate
considerable
reluctance
as
he
came
slowly
*NL*
along
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Quicker
!
'
cried
Sikes
,
laying
the
boy
in
a
dry
ditch
at
his
feet
,
and
*NL*
drawing
a
pistol
from
his
pocket
.
`
Do
n't
play
booty
with
me
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
moment
the
noise
grew
louder
.
Sikes
,
again
looking
round
,
*NL*
could
discern
that
the
men
who
had
given
chase
were
already
climbing
*NL*
the
gate
of
the
field
in
which
he
stood
;
and
that
a
couple
of
dogs
were
*NL*
some
paces
in
advance
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
's
all
up
,
Bill
!
'
cried
Toby
;
`
drop
the
kid
,
and
show
'em
your
*NL*
heels
.
'
With
this
parting
advice
,
Mr.
Crackit
,
preferring
the
chance
*NL*
of
being
shot
by
his
friend
,
to
the
certainty
of
being
taken
by
his
*NL*
enemies
,
fairly
turned
tail
,
and
darted
off
at
full
speed
.
Sikes
*NL*
clenched
his
teeth
;
took
one
look
around
;
threw
over
the
prostrate
form
*NL*
of
Oliver
,
the
cape
in
which
he
had
been
hurriedly
muffled
;
ran
along
*NL*
the
front
of
the
hedge
,
as
if
to
distract
the
attention
of
those
*NL*
behind
,
from
the
spot
where
the
boy
lay
;
paused
,
for
a
second
,
before
*NL*
another
hedge
which
met
it
at
right
angles
;
and
whirling
his
pistol
*NL*
high
into
the
air
,
cleared
it
at
a
bound
,
and
was
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ho
,
ho
,
there
!
'
cried
a
tremulous
voice
in
the
rear
.
`
Pincher
!
*NL*
Neptune
!
Come
here
,
come
here
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
dogs
,
who
,
in
common
with
their
masters
,
seemed
to
have
no
*NL*
particular
relish
for
the
sport
in
which
they
were
engaged
,
readily
*NL*
answered
to
the
command
.
Three
men
,
who
had
by
this
time
advanced
some
*NL*
distance
into
the
field
,
stopped
to
take
counsel
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
My
advice
,
or
,
leastways
,
I
should
say
,
my
_
orders
_
,
is
,
'
said
the
*NL*
fattest
man
of
the
party
,
`
that
we
`
mediately
go
home
again
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
am
agreeable
to
anything
which
is
agreeable
to
Mr.
Giles
,
'
said
a
*NL*
shorter
man
;
who
was
by
no
means
of
a
slim
figure
,
and
who
was
very
*NL*
pale
in
the
face
,
and
very
polite
:
as
frightened
men
frequently
are
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
should
n't
wish
to
appear
ill-mannered
,
gentlemen
,
'
said
the
third
,
*NL*
who
had
called
the
dogs
back
,
`
Mr.
Giles
ought
to
know
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Certainly
,
'
replied
the
shorter
man
;
`
and
whatever
Mr.
Giles
says
,
it
*NL*
is
n't
our
place
to
contradict
him
.
No
,
no
,
I
know
my
sitiwation
!
*NL*
Thank
my
stars
,
I
know
my
sitiwation
.
'
To
tell
the
truth
,
the
little
*NL*
man
_
did
_
seem
to
know
his
situation
,
and
to
know
perfectly
well
that
*NL*
it
was
by
no
means
a
desirable
one
;
for
his
teeth
chattered
in
his
head
*NL*
as
he
spoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
are
afraid
,
Brittles
,
'
said
Mr.
Giles
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
a
n't
,
'
said
Brittles
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
are
,
'
said
Giles
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
're
a
falsehood
,
Mr.
Giles
,
'
said
Brittles
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
're
a
lie
,
Brittles
,
'
said
Mr.
Giles
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
these
four
retorts
arose
from
Mr.
Giles
's
taunt
;
and
Mr.
Giles
's
*NL*
taunt
had
arisen
from
his
indignation
at
having
the
responsibility
of
*NL*
going
home
again
,
imposed
upon
himself
under
cover
of
a
compliment
.
*NL*
The
third
man
brought
the
dispute
to
a
close
,
most
philosophically
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
'll
tell
you
what
it
is
,
gentlemen
,
'
said
he
,
`
we
're
all
afraid
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Speak
for
yourself
,
sir
,
'
said
Mr.
Giles
,
who
was
the
palest
of
the
*NL*
party
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
So
I
do
,
'
replied
the
man
.
`
It
's
natural
and
proper
to
be
afraid
,
*NL*
under
such
circumstances
.
I
am
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
So
am
I
,
'
said
Brittles
;
`
only
there
's
no
call
to
tell
a
man
he
is
,
so
*NL*
bounceably
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
These
frank
admissions
softened
Mr.
Giles
,
who
at
once
owned
that
_
he
_
*NL*
was
afraid
;
upon
which
,
they
all
three
faced
about
,
and
ran
back
again
*NL*
with
the
completest
unanimity
,
until
Mr.
Giles
-LRB-
who
had
the
shortest
*NL*
wind
of
the
party
,
as
was
encumbered
with
a
pitchfork
-RRB-
most
handsomely
*NL*
insisted
on
stopping
,
to
make
an
apology
for
his
hastiness
of
speech
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
it
's
wonderful
,
'
said
Mr.
Giles
,
when
he
had
explained
,
`
what
a
*NL*
man
will
do
,
when
his
blood
is
up
.
I
should
have
committed
murder
--
I
*NL*
know
I
should
--
if
we
'd
caught
one
of
them
rascals
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
other
two
were
impressed
with
a
similar
presentiment
;
and
as
*NL*
their
blood
,
like
his
,
had
all
gone
down
again
;
some
speculation
ensued
*NL*
upon
the
cause
of
this
sudden
change
in
their
temperament
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
know
what
it
was
,
'
said
Mr.
Giles
;
`
it
was
the
gate
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
should
n't
wonder
if
it
was
,
'
exclaimed
Brittles
,
catching
at
the
*NL*
idea
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
may
depend
upon
it
,
'
said
Giles
,
`
that
that
gate
stopped
the
flow
*NL*
of
the
excitement
.
I
felt
all
mine
suddenly
going
away
,
as
I
was
*NL*
climbing
over
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
By
a
remarkable
coincidence
,
the
other
two
had
been
visited
with
the
*NL*
same
unpleasant
sensation
at
that
precise
moment
.
It
was
quite
*NL*
obvious
,
therefore
,
that
it
was
the
gate
;
especially
as
there
was
no
*NL*
doubt
regarding
the
time
at
which
the
change
had
taken
place
,
because
*NL*
all
three
remembered
that
they
had
come
in
sight
of
the
robbers
at
the
*NL*
instant
of
its
occurance
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
dialogue
was
held
between
the
two
men
who
had
surprised
the
*NL*
burglars
,
and
a
travelling
tinker
who
had
been
sleeping
in
an
outhouse
,
*NL*
and
who
had
been
roused
,
together
with
his
two
mongrel
curs
,
to
join
in
*NL*
the
pursuit
.
Mr.
Giles
acted
in
the
double
capacity
of
butler
and
*NL*
steward
to
the
old
lady
of
the
mansion
;
Brittles
was
a
lad
of
all-work
:
*NL*
who
,
having
entered
her
service
a
mere
child
,
was
treated
as
a
*NL*
promising
young
boy
still
,
though
he
was
something
past
thirty
.
*NL*
*NL*
Encouraging
each
other
with
such
converse
as
this
;
but
,
keeping
very
*NL*
close
together
,
notwithstanding
,
and
looking
apprehensively
round
,
*NL*
whenever
a
fresh
gust
rattled
through
the
boughs
;
the
three
men
hurried
*NL*
back
to
a
tree
,
behind
which
they
had
left
their
lantern
,
lest
its
*NL*
light
should
inform
the
thieves
in
what
direction
to
fire
.
Catching
up
*NL*
the
light
,
they
made
the
best
of
their
way
home
,
at
a
good
round
trot
;
*NL*
and
long
after
their
dusky
forms
had
ceased
to
be
discernible
,
the
*NL*
light
might
have
been
seen
twinkling
and
dancing
in
the
distance
,
like
*NL*
some
exhalation
of
the
damp
and
gloomy
atmosphere
through
which
it
was
*NL*
swiftly
borne
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
air
grew
colder
,
as
day
came
slowly
on
;
and
the
mist
rolled
along
*NL*
the
ground
like
a
dense
cloud
of
smoke
.
The
grass
was
wet
;
the
*NL*
pathways
,
and
low
places
,
were
all
mire
and
water
;
the
damp
breath
of
*NL*
an
unwholesome
wind
went
languidly
by
,
with
a
hollow
moaning
.
Still
,
*NL*
Oliver
lay
motionless
and
insensible
on
the
spot
where
Sikes
had
left
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Morning
drew
on
apace
.
The
air
become
more
sharp
and
piercing
,
as
its
*NL*
first
dull
hue
--
the
death
of
night
,
rather
than
the
birth
of
*NL*
day
--
glimmered
faintly
in
the
sky
.
The
objects
which
had
looked
dim
*NL*
and
terrible
in
the
darkness
,
grew
more
and
more
defined
,
and
gradually
*NL*
resolved
into
their
familiar
shapes
.
The
rain
came
down
,
thick
and
*NL*
fast
,
and
pattered
noisily
among
the
leafless
bushes
.
But
,
Oliver
felt
*NL*
it
not
,
as
it
beat
against
him
;
for
he
still
lay
stretched
,
helpless
*NL*
and
unconscious
,
on
his
bed
of
clay
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
,
a
low
cry
of
pain
broke
the
stillness
that
prevailed
;
and
*NL*
uttering
it
,
the
boy
awoke
.
His
left
arm
,
rudely
bandaged
in
a
shawl
,
*NL*
hung
heavy
and
useless
at
his
side
;
the
bandage
was
saturated
with
*NL*
blood
.
He
was
so
weak
,
that
he
could
scarcely
raise
himself
into
a
*NL*
sitting
posture
;
when
he
had
done
so
,
he
looked
feebly
round
for
help
,
*NL*
and
groaned
with
pain
.
Trembling
in
every
joint
,
from
cold
and
*NL*
exhaustion
,
he
made
an
effort
to
stand
upright
;
but
,
shuddering
from
*NL*
head
to
foot
,
fell
prostrate
on
the
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
short
return
of
the
stupor
in
which
he
had
been
so
long
*NL*
plunged
,
Oliver
:
urged
by
a
creeping
sickness
at
his
heart
,
which
*NL*
seemed
to
warn
him
that
if
he
lay
there
,
he
must
surely
die
:
got
upon
*NL*
his
feet
,
and
essayed
to
walk
.
His
head
was
dizzy
,
and
he
staggered
to
*NL*
and
fro
like
a
drunken
man
.
But
he
kept
up
,
nevertheless
,
and
,
with
*NL*
his
head
drooping
languidly
on
his
breast
,
went
stumbling
onward
,
he
*NL*
knew
not
whither
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
,
hosts
of
bewildering
and
confused
ideas
came
crowding
on
his
*NL*
mind
.
He
seemed
to
be
still
walking
between
Sikes
and
Crackit
,
who
*NL*
were
angrily
disputing
--
for
the
very
words
they
said
,
sounded
in
his
*NL*
ears
;
and
when
he
caught
his
own
attention
,
as
it
were
,
by
making
some
*NL*
violent
effort
to
save
himself
from
falling
,
he
found
that
he
was
*NL*
talking
to
them
.
Then
,
he
was
alone
with
Sikes
,
plodding
on
as
on
the
*NL*
previous
day
;
and
as
shadowy
people
passed
them
,
he
felt
the
robber
's
*NL*
grasp
upon
his
wrist
.
Suddenly
,
he
started
back
at
the
report
of
*NL*
firearms
;
there
rose
into
the
air
,
loud
cries
and
shouts
;
lights
*NL*
gleamed
before
his
eyes
;
all
was
noise
and
tumult
,
as
some
unseen
hand
*NL*
bore
him
hurriedly
away
.
Through
all
these
rapid
visions
,
there
ran
an
*NL*
undefined
,
uneasy
consciousness
of
pain
,
which
wearied
and
tormented
*NL*
him
incessantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
he
staggered
on
,
creeping
,
almost
mechanically
,
between
the
bars
*NL*
of
gates
,
or
through
hedge-gaps
as
they
came
in
his
way
,
until
he
*NL*
reached
a
road
.
Here
the
rain
began
to
fall
so
heavily
,
that
it
roused
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
about
,
and
saw
that
at
no
great
distance
there
was
a
house
,
*NL*
which
perhaps
he
could
reach
.
Pitying
his
condition
,
they
might
have
*NL*
compassion
on
him
;
and
if
they
did
not
,
it
would
be
better
,
he
thought
,
*NL*
to
die
near
human
beings
,
than
in
the
lonely
open
fields
.
He
summoned
*NL*
up
all
his
strength
for
one
last
trial
,
and
bent
his
faltering
steps
*NL*
towards
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
drew
nearer
to
this
house
,
a
feeling
come
over
him
that
he
had
*NL*
seen
it
before
.
He
remembered
nothing
of
its
details
;
but
the
shape
*NL*
and
aspect
of
the
building
seemed
familiar
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
garden
wall
!
On
the
grass
inside
,
he
had
fallen
on
his
knees
last
*NL*
night
,
and
prayed
the
two
men
's
mercy
.
It
was
the
very
house
they
had
*NL*
attempted
to
rob
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oliver
felt
such
fear
come
over
him
when
he
recognised
the
place
,
that
,
*NL*
for
the
instant
,
he
forgot
the
agony
of
his
wound
,
and
thought
only
of
*NL*
flight
.
Flight
!
He
could
scarcely
stand
:
and
if
he
were
in
full
*NL*
possession
of
all
the
best
powers
of
his
slight
and
youthful
frame
,
*NL*
whither
could
he
fly
?
He
pushed
against
the
garden-gate
;
it
was
*NL*
unlocked
,
and
swung
open
on
its
hinges
.
He
tottered
across
the
lawn
;
*NL*
climbed
the
steps
;
knocked
faintly
at
the
door
;
and
,
his
whole
strength
*NL*
failing
him
,
sunk
down
against
one
of
the
pillars
of
the
little
portico
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
happened
that
about
this
time
,
Mr.
Giles
,
Brittles
,
and
the
tinker
,
*NL*
were
recruiting
themselves
,
after
the
fatigues
and
terrors
of
the
*NL*
night
,
with
tea
and
sundries
,
in
the
kitchen
.
Not
that
it
was
Mr.
*NL*
Giles
's
habit
to
admit
to
too
great
familiarity
the
humbler
servants
:
*NL*
towards
whom
it
was
rather
his
wont
to
deport
himself
with
a
lofty
*NL*
affability
,
which
,
while
it
gratified
,
could
not
fail
to
remind
them
of
*NL*
his
superior
position
in
society
.
But
,
death
,
fires
,
and
burglary
,
*NL*
make
all
men
equals
;
so
Mr.
Giles
sat
with
his
legs
stretched
out
*NL*
before
the
kitchen
fender
,
leaning
his
left
arm
on
the
table
,
while
,
*NL*
with
his
right
,
he
illustrated
a
circumstantial
and
minute
account
of
*NL*
the
robbery
,
to
which
his
bearers
-LRB-
but
especially
the
cook
and
*NL*
housemaid
,
who
were
of
the
party
-RRB-
listened
with
breathless
interest
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
was
about
half-past
two
,
'
said
Mr.
Giles
,
`
or
I
would
n't
swear
that
*NL*
it
might
n't
have
been
a
little
nearer
three
,
when
I
woke
up
,
and
,
*NL*
turning
round
in
my
bed
,
as
it
might
be
so
,
-LRB-
here
Mr.
Giles
turned
*NL*
round
in
his
chair
,
and
pulled
the
corner
of
the
table-cloth
over
him
*NL*
to
imitate
bed-clothes
,
-RRB-
I
fancied
I
heerd
a
noise
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
point
of
the
narrative
the
cook
turned
pale
,
and
asked
the
*NL*
housemaid
to
shut
the
door
:
who
asked
Brittles
,
who
asked
the
tinker
,
*NL*
who
pretended
not
to
hear
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
--
Heerd
a
noise
,
'
continued
Mr.
Giles
.
'
I
says
,
at
first
,
``
This
is
*NL*
illusion
''
;
and
was
composing
myself
off
to
sleep
,
when
I
heerd
the
*NL*
noise
again
,
distinct
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
sort
of
a
noise
?
'
asked
the
cook
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
A
kind
of
a
busting
noise
,
'
replied
Mr.
Giles
,
looking
round
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
More
like
the
noise
of
powdering
a
iron
bar
on
a
nutmeg-grater
,
'
*NL*
suggested
Brittles
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
was
,
when
_
you
_
heerd
it
,
sir
,
'
rejoined
Mr.
Giles
;
`
but
,
at
this
*NL*
time
,
it
had
a
busting
sound
.
I
turned
down
the
clothes
'
;
continued
*NL*
Giles
,
rolling
back
the
table-cloth
,
`
sat
up
in
bed
;
and
listened
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
cook
and
housemaid
simultaneously
ejaculated
`
Lor
!
'
and
drew
their
*NL*
chairs
closer
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
heerd
it
now
,
quite
apparent
,
'
resumed
Mr.
Giles
.
'
``
Somebody
,
''
I
*NL*
says
,
``
is
forcing
of
a
door
,
or
window
;
what
's
to
be
done
?
I
'll
call
up
*NL*
that
poor
lad
,
Brittles
,
and
save
him
from
being
murdered
in
his
bed
;
*NL*
or
his
throat
,
''
I
says
,
``
may
be
cut
from
his
right
ear
to
his
left
,
*NL*
without
his
ever
knowing
it
.
''
'
*NL*
*NL*
Here
,
all
eyes
were
turned
upon
Brittles
,
who
fixed
his
upon
the
*NL*
speaker
,
and
stared
at
him
,
with
his
mouth
wide
open
,
and
his
face
*NL*
expressive
of
the
most
unmitigated
horror
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
tossed
off
the
clothes
,
'
said
Giles
,
throwing
away
the
table-cloth
,
*NL*
and
looking
very
hard
at
the
cook
and
housemaid
,
`
got
softly
out
of
*NL*
bed
;
drew
on
a
pair
of
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ladies
present
,
Mr.
Giles
,
'
murmured
the
tinker
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
--
Of
_
shoes
_
,
sir
,
'
said
Giles
,
turning
upon
him
,
and
laying
great
*NL*
emphasis
on
the
word
;
`
seized
the
loaded
pistol
that
always
goes
*NL*
upstairs
with
the
plate-basket
;
and
walked
on
tiptoes
to
his
room
.
*NL*
``
Brittles
,
''
I
says
,
when
I
had
woke
him
,
``
do
n't
be
frightened
!
''
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
So
you
did
,
'
observed
Brittles
,
in
a
low
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
We
're
dead
men
,
I
think
,
Brittles
,
''
I
says
,
'
continued
Giles
;
'
``
but
*NL*
do
n't
be
frightened
.
''
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
_
Was
_
he
frightened
?
'
asked
the
cook
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Not
a
bit
of
it
,
'
replied
Mr.
Giles
.
`
He
was
as
firm
--
ah
!
pretty
near
*NL*
as
firm
as
I
was
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
should
have
died
at
once
,
I
'm
sure
,
if
it
had
been
me
,
'
observed
the
*NL*
housemaid
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
're
a
woman
,
'
retorted
Brittles
,
plucking
up
a
little
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Brittles
is
right
,
'
said
Mr.
Giles
,
nodding
his
head
,
approvingly
;
*NL*
`
from
a
woman
,
nothing
else
was
to
be
expected
.
We
,
being
men
,
took
a
*NL*
dark
lantern
that
was
standing
on
Brittle
's
hob
,
and
groped
our
way
*NL*
downstairs
in
the
pitch
dark
,
--
as
it
might
be
so
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Giles
had
risen
from
his
seat
,
and
taken
two
steps
with
his
eyes
*NL*
shut
,
to
accompany
his
description
with
appropriate
action
,
when
he
*NL*
started
violently
,
in
common
with
the
rest
of
the
company
,
and
hurried
*NL*
back
to
his
chair
.
The
cook
and
housemaid
screamed
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
was
a
knock
,
'
said
Mr.
Giles
,
assuming
perfect
serenity
.
`
Open
the
*NL*
door
,
somebody
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Nobody
moved
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
seems
a
strange
sort
of
a
thing
,
a
knock
coming
at
such
a
time
in
*NL*
the
morning
,
'
said
Mr.
Giles
,
surveying
the
pale
faces
which
surrounded
*NL*
him
,
and
looking
very
blank
himself
;
`
but
the
door
must
be
opened
.
Do
*NL*
you
hear
,
somebody
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Giles
,
as
he
spoke
,
looked
at
Brittles
;
but
that
young
man
,
being
*NL*
naturally
modest
,
probably
considered
himself
nobody
,
and
so
held
that
*NL*
the
inquiry
could
not
have
any
application
to
him
;
at
all
events
,
he
*NL*
tendered
no
reply
.
Mr.
Giles
directed
an
appealing
glance
at
the
*NL*
tinker
;
but
he
had
suddenly
fallen
asleep
.
The
women
were
out
of
the
*NL*
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
If
Brittles
would
rather
open
the
door
,
in
the
presence
of
witnesses
,
'
*NL*
said
Mr.
Giles
,
after
a
short
silence
,
'
I
am
ready
to
make
one
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
So
am
I
,
'
said
the
tinker
,
waking
up
,
as
suddenly
as
he
had
fallen
*NL*
asleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
Brittles
capitulated
on
these
terms
;
and
the
party
being
somewhat
*NL*
re-assured
by
the
discovery
-LRB-
made
on
throwing
open
the
shutters
-RRB-
that
*NL*
it
was
now
broad
day
,
took
their
way
upstairs
;
with
the
dogs
in
front
.
*NL*
The
two
women
,
who
were
afraid
to
stay
below
,
brought
up
the
rear
.
By
*NL*
the
advice
of
Mr.
Giles
,
they
all
talked
very
loud
,
to
warn
any
*NL*
evil-disposed
person
outside
,
that
they
were
strong
in
numbers
;
and
by
*NL*
a
master-stoke
of
policy
,
originating
in
the
brain
of
the
same
*NL*
ingenious
gentleman
,
the
dogs
'
tails
were
well
pinched
,
in
the
hall
,
to
*NL*
make
them
bark
savagely
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
precautions
having
been
taken
,
Mr.
Giles
held
on
fast
by
the
*NL*
tinker
's
arm
-LRB-
to
prevent
his
running
away
,
as
he
pleasantly
said
-RRB-
,
and
*NL*
gave
the
word
of
command
to
open
the
door
.
Brittles
obeyed
;
the
group
,
*NL*
peeping
timorously
over
each
other
's
shoulders
,
beheld
no
more
*NL*
formidable
object
than
poor
little
Oliver
Twist
,
speechless
and
*NL*
exhausted
,
who
raised
his
heavy
eyes
,
and
mutely
solicited
their
*NL*
compassion
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
A
boy
!
'
exclaimed
Mr.
Giles
,
valiantly
,
pushing
the
tinker
into
the
*NL*
background
.
`
What
's
the
matter
with
the
--
eh
?
--
Why
--
Brittles
--
look
*NL*
here
--
do
n't
you
know
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
Brittles
,
who
had
got
behind
the
door
to
open
it
,
no
sooner
saw
Oliver
,
*NL*
than
he
uttered
a
loud
cry
.
Mr.
Giles
,
seizing
the
boy
by
one
leg
and
*NL*
one
arm
-LRB-
fortunately
not
the
broken
limb
-RRB-
lugged
him
straight
into
the
*NL*
hall
,
and
deposited
him
at
full
length
on
the
floor
thereof
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Here
he
is
!
'
bawled
Giles
,
calling
in
a
state
of
great
excitement
,
up
*NL*
the
staircase
;
`
here
's
one
of
the
thieves
,
ma'am
!
Here
's
a
thief
,
miss
!
*NL*
Wounded
,
miss
!
I
shot
him
,
miss
;
and
Brittles
held
the
light
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
--
In
a
lantern
,
miss
,
'
cried
Brittles
,
applying
one
hand
to
the
side
*NL*
of
his
mouth
,
so
that
his
voice
might
travel
the
better
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
women-servants
ran
upstairs
to
carry
the
intelligence
that
Mr.
*NL*
Giles
had
captured
a
robber
;
and
the
tinker
busied
himself
in
*NL*
endeavouring
to
restore
Oliver
,
lest
he
should
die
before
he
could
be
*NL*
hanged
.
In
the
midst
of
all
this
noise
and
commotion
,
there
was
heard
*NL*
a
sweet
female
voice
,
which
quelled
it
in
an
instant
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Giles
!
'
whispered
the
voice
from
the
stair-head
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
'm
here
,
miss
,
'
replied
Mr.
Giles
.
`
Do
n't
be
frightened
,
miss
;
I
*NL*
ai
n't
much
injured
.
He
did
n't
make
a
very
desperate
resistance
,
miss
!
*NL*
I
was
soon
too
many
for
him
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Hush
!
'
replied
the
young
lady
;
`
you
frighten
my
aunt
as
much
as
the
*NL*
thieves
did
.
Is
the
poor
creature
much
hurt
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Wounded
desperate
,
miss
,
'
replied
Giles
,
with
indescribable
*NL*
complacency
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
looks
as
if
he
was
a-going
,
miss
,
'
bawled
Brittles
,
in
the
same
*NL*
manner
as
before
.
`
Would
n't
you
like
to
come
and
look
at
him
,
miss
,
in
*NL*
case
he
should
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Hush
,
pray
;
there
's
a
good
man
!
'
rejoined
the
lady
.
`
Wait
quietly
*NL*
only
one
instant
,
while
I
speak
to
aunt
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
With
a
footstep
as
soft
and
gentle
as
the
voice
,
the
speaker
tripped
*NL*
away
.
She
soon
returned
,
with
the
direction
that
the
wounded
person
*NL*
was
to
be
carried
,
carefully
,
upstairs
to
Mr.
Giles
's
room
;
and
that
*NL*
Brittles
was
to
saddle
the
pony
and
betake
himself
instantly
to
*NL*
Chertsey
:
from
which
place
,
he
was
to
despatch
,
with
all
speed
,
a
*NL*
constable
and
doctor
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
wo
n't
you
take
one
look
at
him
,
first
,
miss
?
'
asked
Mr.
Giles
,
*NL*
with
as
much
pride
as
if
Oliver
were
some
bird
of
rare
plumage
,
that
he
*NL*
had
skilfully
brought
down
.
`
Not
one
little
peep
,
miss
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Not
now
,
for
the
world
,
'
replied
the
young
lady
.
`
Poor
fellow
!
Oh
!
*NL*
treat
him
kindly
,
Giles
for
my
sake
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
servant
looked
up
at
the
speaker
,
as
she
turned
away
,
with
a
*NL*
glance
as
proud
and
admiring
as
if
she
had
been
his

child

Then
,
*NL*
bending
over

of
a

CHAPTER
XXIX
*NL*
*NL*
HAS
AN
INTRODUCTORY
ACCOUNT
OF
THE
INMATES
OF
THE
HOUSE
,
TO
WHICH
*NL*
OLIVER
RESORTED
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
handsome
room
:
though
its
furniture
had
rather
the
air
of
*NL*
old-fashioned
comfort
,
than
of
modern
elegance
:
there
sat
two
ladies
*NL*
at
a
well-spread
breakfast-table
.
Mr.
Giles
,
dressed
with
scrupulous
*NL*
care
in
a
full
suit
of
black
,
was
in
attendance
upon
them
.
He
had
*NL*
taken
his
station
some
half-way
between
the
side-board
and
the
*NL*
breakfast-table
;
and
,
with
his
body
drawn
up
to
its
full
height
,
his
*NL*
head
thrown
back
,
and
inclined
the
merest
trifle
on
one
side
,
his
left
*NL*
leg
advanced
,
and
his
right
hand
thrust
into
his
waist-coat
,
while
his
*NL*
left
hung
down
by
his
side
,
grasping
a
waiter
,
looked
like
one
who
*NL*
laboured
under
a
very
agreeable
sense
of
his
own
merits
and
importance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
the
two
ladies
,
one
was
well
advanced
in
years
;
but
the
high-backed
*NL*
oaken
chair
in
which
she
sat
,
was
not
more
upright
than
she
.
Dressed
*NL*
with
the
utmost
nicety
and
precision
,
in
a
quaint
mixture
of
by-gone
*NL*
costume
,
with
some
slight
concessions
to
the
prevailing
taste
,
which
*NL*
rather
served
to
point
the
old
style
pleasantly
than
to
impair
its
*NL*
effect
,
she
sat
,
in
a
stately
manner
,
with
her
hands
folded
on
the
*NL*
table
before
her
.
Her
eyes
-LRB-
and
age
had
dimmed
but
little
of
their
*NL*
brightness
-RRB-
were
attentively
upon
her
young
companion
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
younger
lady
was
in
the
lovely
bloom
and
spring-time
of
womanhood
;
*NL*
at
that
age
,
when
,
if
ever
angels
be
for
God
's
good
purposes
enthroned
*NL*
in
mortal
forms
,
they
may
be
,
without
impiety
,
supposed
to
abide
in
*NL*
such
as
hers
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
not
past
seventeen
.
Cast
in
so
slight
and
exquisite
a
mould
;
*NL*
so
mild
and
gentle
;
so
pure
and
beautiful
;
that
earth
seemed
not
her
*NL*
element
,
nor
its
rough
creatures
her
fit
companions
.
The
very
*NL*
intelligence
that
shone
in
her
deep
blue
eye
,
and
was
stamped
upon
her
*NL*
noble
head
,
seemed
scarcely
of
her
age
,
or
of
the
world
;
and
yet
the
*NL*
changing
expression
of
sweetness
and
good
humour
,
the
thousand
lights
*NL*
that
played
about
the
face
,
and
left
no
shadow
there
;
above
all
,
the
*NL*
smile
,
the
cheerful
,
happy
smile
,
were
made
for
Home
,
and
fireside
*NL*
peace
and
happiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
busily
engaged
in
the
little
offices
of
the
table
.
Chancing
to
*NL*
raise
her
eyes
as
the
elder
lady
was
regarding
her
,
she
playfully
put
*NL*
back
her
hair
,
which
was
simply
braided
on
her
forehead
;
and
threw
into
*NL*
her
beaming
look
,
such
an
expression
of
affection
and
artless
*NL*
loveliness
,
that
blessed
spirits
might
have
smiled
to
look
upon
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
Brittles
has
been
gone
upwards
of
an
hour
,
has
he
?
'
asked
the
old
*NL*
lady
,
after
a
pause
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
An
hour
and
twelve
minutes
,
ma'am
,
'
replied
Mr.
Giles
,
referring
to
a
*NL*
silver
watch
,
which
he
drew
forth
by
a
black
ribbon
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
is
always
slow
,
'
remarked
the
old
lady
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Brittles
always
was
a
slow
boy
,
ma'am
,
'
replied
the
attendant
.
And
*NL*
seeing
,
by
the
bye
,
that
Brittles
had
been
a
slow
boy
for
upwards
of
*NL*
thirty
years
,
there
appeared
no
great
probability
of
his
ever
being
a
*NL*
fast
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
gets
worse
instead
of
better
,
I
think
,
'
said
the
elder
lady
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
is
very
inexcusable
in
him
if
he
stops
to
play
with
any
other
*NL*
boys
,
'
said
the
young
lady
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Giles
was
apparently
considering
the
propriety
of
indulging
in
a
*NL*
respectful
smile
himself
,
when
a
gig
drove
up
to
the
garden-gate
:
out
*NL*
of
which
there
jumped
a
fat
gentleman
,
who
ran
straight
up
to
the
door
:
*NL*
and
who
,
getting
quickly
into
the
house
by
some
mysterious
process
,
*NL*
burst
into
the
room
,
and
nearly
overturned
Mr.
Giles
and
the
*NL*
breakfast-table
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
!
'
exclaimed
the
fat
gentleman
.
`
My
dear
*NL*
Mrs.
Maylie
--
bless
my
soul
--
in
the
silence
of
the
night
,
too
--
I
_
never
_
*NL*
heard
of
such
a
thing
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
With
these
expressions
of
condolence
,
the
fat
gentleman
shook
hands
*NL*
with
both
ladies
,
and
drawing
up
a
chair
,
inquired
how
they
found
*NL*
themselves
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
ought
to
be
dead
;
positively
dead
with
the
fright
,
'
said
the
fat
*NL*
gentleman
.
`
Why
did
n't
you
send
?
Bless
me
,
my
man
should
have
come
in
*NL*
a
minute
;
and
so
would
I
;
and
my
assistant
would
have
been
delighted
;
*NL*
or
anybody
,
I
'm
sure
,
under
such
circumstances
.
Dear
,
dear
!
So
*NL*
unexpected
!
In
the
silence
of
the
night
,
too
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
doctor
seemed
expecially
troubled
by
the
fact
of
the
robbery
having
*NL*
been
unexpected
,
and
attempted
in
the
night-time
;
as
if
it
were
the
*NL*
established
custom
of
gentlemen
in
the
housebreaking
way
to
transact
*NL*
business
at
noon
,
and
to
make
an
appointment
,
by
post
,
a
day
or
two
*NL*
previous
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
you
,
Miss
Rose
,
'
said
the
doctor
,
turning
to
the
young
lady
,
`
I
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
!
very
much
so
,
indeed
,
'
said
Rose
,
interrupting
him
;
`
but
there
is
*NL*
a
poor
creature
upstairs
,
whom
aunt
wishes
you
to
see
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ah
!
to
be
sure
,
'
replied
the
doctor
,
`
so
there
is
.
That
was
your
*NL*
handiwork
,
Giles
,
I
understand
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Giles
,
who
had
been
feverishly
putting
the
tea-cups
to
rights
,
*NL*
blushed
very
red
,
and
said
that
he
had
had
that
honour
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Honour
,
eh
?
'
said
the
doctor
;
`
well
,
I
do
n't
know
;
perhaps
it
's
as
*NL*
honourable
to
hit
a
thief
in
a
back
kitchen
,
as
to
hit
your
man
at
*NL*
twelve
paces
.
Fancy
that
he
fired
in
the
air
,
and
you
've
fought
a
*NL*
duel
,
Giles
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Giles
,
who
thought
this
light
treatment
of
the
matter
an
unjust
*NL*
attempt
at
diminishing
his
glory
,
answered
respectfully
,
that
it
was
*NL*
not
for
the
like
of
him
to
judge
about
that
;
but
he
rather
thought
it
*NL*
was
no
joke
to
the
opposite
party
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Gad
,
that
's
true
!
'
said
the
doctor
.
`
Where
is
he
?
Show
me
the
way
.
*NL*
I
'll
look
in
again
,
as
I
come
down
,
Mrs.
Maylie
.
That
's
the
little
*NL*
window
that
he
got
in
at
,
eh
?
Well
,
I
could
n't
have
believed
it
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Talking
all
the
way
,
he
followed
Mr.
Giles
upstairs
;
and
while
he
is
*NL*
going
upstairs
,
the
reader
may
be
informed
,
that
Mr.
Losberne
,
a
*NL*
surgeon
in
the
neighbourhood
,
known
through
a
circuit
of
ten
miles
*NL*
round
as
`
the
doctor
,
'
had
grown
fat
,
more
from
good-humour
than
from
*NL*
good
living
:
and
was
as
kind
and
hearty
,
and
withal
as
eccentric
an
*NL*
old
bachelor
,
as
will
be
found
in
five
times
that
space
,
by
any
*NL*
explorer
alive
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
doctor
was
absent
,
much
longer
than
either
he
or
the
ladies
had
*NL*
anticipated
.
A
large
flat
box
was
fetched
out
of
the
gig
;
and
a
*NL*
bedroom
bell
was
rung
very
often
;
and
the
servants
ran
up
and
down
*NL*
stairs
perpetually
;
from
which
tokens
it
was
justly
concluded
that
*NL*
something
important
was
going
on
above
.
At
length
he
returned
;
and
in
*NL*
reply
to
an
anxious
inquiry
after
his
patient
;
looked
very
mysterious
,
*NL*
and
closed
the
door
,
carefully
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
This
is
a
very
extraordinary
thing
,
Mrs.
Maylie
,
'
said
the
doctor
,
*NL*
standing
with
his
back
to
the
door
,
as
if
to
keep
it
shut
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
is
not
in
danger
,
I
hope
?
'
said
the
old
lady
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
that
would
_
not
_
be
an
extraordinary
thing
,
under
the
*NL*
circumstances
,
'
replied
the
doctor
;
`
though
I
do
n't
think
he
is
.
Have
*NL*
you
seen
the
thief
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
'
rejoined
the
old
lady
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Nor
heard
anything
about
him
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
beg
your
pardon
,
ma'am
,
interposed
Mr.
Giles
;
`
but
I
was
going
to
*NL*
tell
you
about
him
when
Doctor
Losberne
came
in
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
fact
was
,
that
Mr.
Giles
had
not
,
at
first
,
been
able
to
bring
his
*NL*
mind
to
the
avowal
,
that
he
had
only
shot
a
boy
.
Such
commendations
*NL*
had
been
bestowed
upon
his
bravery
,
that
he
could
not
,
for
the
life
of
*NL*
him
,
help
postponing
the
explanation
for
a
few
delicious
minutes
;
*NL*
during
which
he
had
flourished
,
in
the
very
zenith
of
a
brief
*NL*
reputation
for
undaunted
courage
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Rose
wished
to
see
the
man
,
'
said
Mrs.
Maylie
,
`
but
I
would
n't
hear
of
*NL*
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Humph
!
'
rejoined
the
doctor
.
`
There
is
nothing
very
alarming
in
his
*NL*
appearance
.
Have
you
any
objection
to
see
him
in
my
presence
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
If
it
be
necessary
,
'
replied
the
old
lady
,
`
certainly
not
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Then
I
think
it
is
necessary
,
'
said
the
doctor
;
`
at
all
events
,
I
am
*NL*
quite
sure
that
you
would
deeply
regret
not
having
done
so
,
if
you
*NL*
postponed
it
.
He
is
perfectly
quiet
and
comfortable
now
.
Allow
*NL*
me
--
Miss
Rose
,
will
you
permit
me
?
Not
the
slightest
fear
,
I
pledge
*NL*
you
my
honour
!

CHAPTER
XXX
*NL*
*NL*
RELATES
WHAT
OLIVER
'S
NEW
VISITORS
THOUGHT
OF
HIM
*NL*
*NL*
With
many
loquacious
assurances
that
they
would
be
agreeably
surprised
*NL*
in
the
aspect
of
the
criminal
,
the
doctor
drew
the
young
lady
's
arm
*NL*
through
one
of
his
;
and
offering
his
disengaged
hand
to
Mrs.
Maylie
,
*NL*
led
them
,
with
much
ceremony
and
stateliness
,
upstairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Now
,
'
said
the
doctor
,
in
a
whisper
,
as
he
softly
turned
the
handle
of
*NL*
a
bedroom-door
,
`
let
us
hear
what
you
think
of
him
.
He
has
not
been
*NL*
shaved
very
recently
,
but
he
do
n't
look
at
all
ferocious
*NL*
notwithstanding
.
Stop
,
though
!
Let
me
first
see
that
he
is
in
*NL*
visiting
order
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Stepping
before
them
,
he
looked
into
the
room
.
Motioning
them
to
*NL*
advance
,
he
closed
the
door
when
they
had
entered
;
and
gently
drew
back
*NL*
the
curtains
of
the
bed
.
Upon
it
,
in
lieu
of
the
dogged
,
black-visaged
*NL*
ruffian
they
had
expected
to
behold
,
there
lay
a
mere
child
:
worn
with
*NL*
pain
and
exhaustion
,
and
sunk
into
a
deep
sleep
.
His
wounded
arm
,
*NL*
bound
and
splintered
up
,
was
crossed
upon
his
breast
;
his
head
reclined
*NL*
upon
the
other
arm
,
which
was
half
hidden
by
his
long
hair
,
as
it
*NL*
streamed
over
the
pillow
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
honest
gentleman
held
the
curtain
in
his
hand
,
and
looked
on
,
for
a
*NL*
minute
or
so
,
in
silence
.
Whilst
he
was
watching
the
patient
thus
,
the
*NL*
younger
lady
glided
softly
past
,
and
seating
herself
in
a
chair
by
the
*NL*
bedside
,
gathered
Oliver
's
hair
from
his
face
.
As
she
stooped
over
*NL*
him
,
her
tears
fell
upon
his
forehead
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
boy
stirred
,
and
smiled
in
his
sleep
,
as
though
these
marks
of
pity
*NL*
and
compassion
had
awakened
some
pleasant
dream
of
a
love
and
affection
*NL*
he
had
never
known
.
Thus
,
a
strain
of
gentle
music
,
or
the
rippling
of
*NL*
water
in
a
silent
place
,
or
the
odour
of
a
flower
,
or
the
mention
of
a
*NL*
familiar
word
,
will
sometimes
call
up
sudden
dim
remembrances
of
scenes
*NL*
that
never
were
,
in
this
life
;
which
vanish
like
a
breath
;
which
some
*NL*
brief
memory
of
a
happier
existence
,
long
gone
by
,
would
seem
to
have
*NL*
awakened
;
which
no
voluntary
exertion
of
the
mind
can
ever
recall
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
can
this
mean
?
'
exclaimed
the
elder
lady
.
`
This
poor
child
can
*NL*
never
have
been
the
pupil
of
robbers
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Vice
,
'
said
the
surgeon
,
replacing
the
curtain
,
`
takes
up
her
abode
in
*NL*
many
temples
;
and
who
can
say
that
a
fair
outside
shell
not
enshrine
*NL*
her
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
at
so
early
an
age
!
'
urged
Rose
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
My
dear
young
lady
,
'
rejoined
the
surgeon
,
mournfully
shaking
his
*NL*
head
;
`
crime
,
like
death
,
is
not
confined
to
the
old
and
withered
*NL*
alone
.
The
youngest
and
fairest
are
too
often
its
chosen
victims
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
,
can
you
--
oh
!
can
you
really
believe
that
this
delicate
boy
has
*NL*
been
the
voluntary
associate
of
the
worst
outcasts
of
society
?
'
said
*NL*
Rose
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
surgeon
shook
his
head
,
in
a
manner
which
intimated
that
he
feared
*NL*
it
was
very
possible
;
and
observing
that
they
might
disturb
the
*NL*
patient
,
led
the
way
into
an
adjoining
apartment
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
even
if
he
has
been
wicked
,
'
pursued
Rose
,
`
think
how
young
he
is
;
*NL*
think
that
he
may
never
have
known
a
mother
's
love
,
or
the
comfort
of
a
*NL*
home
;
that
ill-usage
and
blows
,
or
the
want
of
bread
,
may
have
driven
*NL*
him
to
herd
with
men
who
have
forced
him
to
guilt
.
Aunt
,
dear
aunt
,
*NL*
for
mercy
's
sake
,
think
of
this
,
before
you
let
them
drag
this
sick
*NL*
child
to
a
prison
,
which
in
any
case
must
be
the
grave
of
all
his
*NL*
chances
of
amendment
.
Oh
!
as
you
love
me
,
and
know
that
I
have
never
*NL*
felt
the
want
of
parents
in
your
goodness
and
affection
,
but
that
I
*NL*
might
have
done
so
,
and
might
have
been
equally
helpless
and
*NL*
unprotected
with
this
poor
child
,
have
pity
upon
him
before
it
is
too
*NL*
late
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
My
dear
love
,
'
said
the
elder
lady
,
as
she
folded
the
weeping
girl
to
*NL*
her
bosom
,
`
do
you
think
I
would
harm
a
hair
of
his
head
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
,
no
!
'
replied
Rose
,
eagerly
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
surely
,
'
said
the
old
lady
;
`
my
days
are
drawing
to
their
close
:
*NL*
and
may
mercy
be
shown
to
me
as
I
show
it
to
others
!
What
can
I
do
to
*NL*
save
him
,
sir
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Let
me
think
,
ma'am
,
'
said
the
doctor
;
`
let
me
think
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Losberne
thrust
his
hands
into
his
pockets
,
and
took
several
turns
*NL*
up
and
down
the
room
;
often
stopping
,
and
balancing
himself
on
his
*NL*
toes
,
and
frowning
frightfully
.
After
various
exclamations
of
`
I
've
*NL*
got
it
now
'
and
`
no
,
I
have
n't
,
'
and
as
many
renewals
of
the
walking
*NL*
and
frowning
,
he
at
length
made
a
dead
halt
,
and
spoke
as
follows
:
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
think
if
you
give
me
a
full
and
unlimited
commission
to
bully
Giles
,
*NL*
and
that
little
boy
,
Brittles
,
I
can
manage
it
.
Giles
is
a
faithful
*NL*
fellow
and
an
old
servant
,
I
know
;
but
you
can
make
it
up
to
him
in
a
*NL*
thousand
ways
,
and
reward
him
for
being
such
a
good
shot
besides
.
You
*NL*
do
n't
object
to
that
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Unless
there
is
some
other
way
of
preserving
the
child
,
'
replied
Mrs.
*NL*
Maylie
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
There
is
no
other
,
'
said
the
doctor
.
`
No
other
,
take
my
word
for
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Then
my
aunt
invests
you
with
full
power
,
'
said
Rose
,
smiling
through
*NL*
her
tears
;
`
but
pray
do
n't
be
harder
upon
the
poor
fellows
than
is
*NL*
indispensably
necessary
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
seem
to
think
,
'
retorted
the
doctor
,
`
that
everybody
is
disposed
*NL*
to
be
hard-hearted
to-day
,
except
yourself
,
Miss
Rose
.
I
only
hope
,
for
*NL*
the
sake
of
the
rising
male
sex
generally
,
that
you
may
be
found
in
as
*NL*
vulnerable
and
soft-hearted
a
mood
by
the
first
eligible
young
fellow
*NL*
who
appeals
to
your
compassion
;
and
I
wish
I
were
a
young
fellow
,
that
*NL*
I
might
avail
myself
,
on
the
spot
,
of
such
a
favourable
opportunity
for
*NL*
doing
so
,
as
the
present
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
are
as
great
a
boy
as
poor
Brittles
himself
,
'
returned
Rose
,
*NL*
blushing
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
'
said
the
doctor
,
laughing
heartily
,
`
that
is
no
very
difficult
*NL*
matter
.
But
to
return
to
this
boy
.
The
great
point
of
our
agreement
*NL*
is
yet
to
come
.
He
will
wake
in
an
hour
or
so
,
I
dare
say
;
and
*NL*
although
I
have
told
that
thick-headed
constable-fellow
downstairs
that
*NL*
he
mus
n't
be
moved
or
spoken
to
,
on
peril
of
his
life
,
I
think
we
may
*NL*
converse
with
him
without
danger
.
Now
I
make
this
stipulation
--
that
I
*NL*
shall
examine
him
in
your
presence
,
and
that
,
if
,
from
what
he
says
,
we
*NL*
judge
,
and
I
can
show
to
the
satisfaction
of
your
cool
reason
,
that
he
*NL*
is
a
real
and
thorough
bad
one
-LRB-
which
is
more
than
possible
-RRB-
,
he
shall
*NL*
be
left
to
his
fate
,
without
any
farther
interference
on
my
part
,
at
*NL*
all
events
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
no
,
aunt
!
'
entreated
Rose
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
yes
,
aunt
!
'
said
the
doctor
.
`
Is
is
a
bargain
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
can
not
be
hardened
in
vice
,
'
said
Rose
;
`
It
is
impossible
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Very
good
,
'
retorted
the
doctor
;
`
then
so
much
the
more
reason
for
*NL*
acceding
to
my
proposition
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Finally
the
treaty
was
entered
into
;
and
the
parties
thereunto
sat
down
*NL*
to
wait
,
with
some
impatience
,
until
Oliver
should
awake
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
patience
of
the
two
ladies
was
destined
to
undergo
a
longer
trial
*NL*
than
Mr.
Losberne
had
led
them
to
expect
;
for
hour
after
hour
passed
*NL*
on
,
and
still
Oliver
slumbered
heavily
.
It
was
evening
,
indeed
,
before
*NL*
the
kind-hearted
doctor
brought
them
the
intelligence
,
that
he
was
at
*NL*
length
sufficiently
restored
to
be
spoken
to
.
The
boy
was
very
ill
,
he
*NL*
said
,
and
weak
from
the
loss
of
blood
;
but
his
mind
was
so
troubled
*NL*
with
anxiety
to
disclose
something
,
that
he
deemed
it
better
to
give
*NL*
him
the
opportunity
,
than
to
insist
upon
his
remaining
quiet
until
next
*NL*
morning
:
which
he
should
otherwise
have
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
conference
was
a
long
one
.
Oliver
told
them
all
his
simple
*NL*
history
,
and
was
often
compelled
to
stop
,
by
pain
and
want
of
strength
.
*NL*
It
was
a
solemn
thing
,
to
hear
,
in
the
darkened
room
,
the
feeble
voice
*NL*
of
the
sick
child
recounting
a
weary
catalogue
of
evils
and
calamities
*NL*
which
hard
men
had
brought
upon
him
.
Oh
!
if
when
we
oppress
and
grind
*NL*
our
fellow-creatures
,
we
bestowed
but
one
thought
on
the
dark
evidences
*NL*
of
human
error
,
which
,
like
dense
and
heavy
clouds
,
are
rising
,
slowly
*NL*
it
is
true
,
but
not
less
surely
,
to
Heaven
,
to
pour
their
*NL*
after-vengeance
on
our
heads
;
if
we
heard
but
one
instant
,
in
*NL*
imagination
,
the
deep
testimony
of
dead
men
's
voices
,
which
no
power
*NL*
can
stifle
,
and
no
pride
shut
out
;
where
would
be
the
injury
and
*NL*
injustice
,
the
suffering
,
misery
,
cruelty
,
and
wrong
,
that
each
day
's
*NL*
life
brings
with
it
!
*NL*
*NL*
Oliver
's
pillow
was
smoothed
by
gentle
hands
that
night
;
and
loveliness
*NL*
and
virtue
watched
him
as
he
slept
.
He
felt
calm
and
happy
,
and
could
*NL*
have
died
without
a
murmur
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
momentous
interview
was
no
sooner
concluded
,
and
Oliver
composed
to
*NL*
rest
again
,
than
the
doctor
,
after
wiping
his
eyes
,
and
condemning
them
*NL*
for
being
weak
all
at
once
,
betook
himself
downstairs
to
open
upon
Mr.
*NL*
Giles
.
And
finding
nobody
about
the
parlours
,
it
occurred
to
him
,
that
*NL*
he
could
perhaps
originate
the
proceedings
with
better
effect
in
the
*NL*
kitchen
;
so
into
the
kitchen
he
went
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
assembled
,
in
that
lower
house
of
the
domestic
parliament
,
*NL*
the
women-servants
,
Mr.
Brittles
,
Mr.
Giles
,
the
tinker
-LRB-
who
had
*NL*
received
a
special
invitation
to
regale
himself
for
the
remainder
of
*NL*
the
day
,
in
consideration
of
his
services
-RRB-
,
and
the
constable
.
The
*NL*
latter
gentleman
had
a
large
staff
,
a
large
head
,
large
features
,
and
*NL*
large
half-boots
;
and
he
looked
as
if
he
had
been
taking
a
*NL*
proportionate
allowance
of
ale
--
as
indeed
he
had
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
adventures
of
the
previous
night
were
still
under
discussion
;
for
*NL*
Mr.
Giles
was
expatiating
upon
his
presence
of
mind
,
when
the
doctor
*NL*
entered
;
Mr.
Brittles
,
with
a
mug
of
ale
in
his
hand
,
was
corroborating
*NL*
everything
,
before
his
superior
said
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Sit
still
!
'
said
the
doctor
,
waving
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Thank
you
,
sir
,
said
Mr.
Giles
.
`
Misses
wished
some
ale
to
be
given
*NL*
out
,
sir
;
and
as
I
felt
no
ways
inclined
for
my
own
little
room
,
sir
,
*NL*
and
was
disposed
for
company
,
I
am
taking
mine
among
'em
here
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Brittles
headed
a
low
murmur
,
by
which
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
*NL*
generally
were
understood
to
express
the
gratification
they
derived
*NL*
from
Mr.
Giles
's
condescension
.
Mr.
Giles
looked
round
with
a
*NL*
patronising
air
,
as
much
as
to
say
that
so
long
as
they
behaved
*NL*
properly
,
he
would
never
desert
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
How
is
the
patient
to-night
,
sir
?
'
asked
Giles
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
So-so
'
;
returned
the
doctor
.
'
I
am
afraid
you
have
got
yourself
into
*NL*
a
scrape
there
,
Mr.
Giles
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
hope
you
do
n't
mean
to
say
,
sir
,
'
said
Mr.
Giles
,
trembling
,
`
that
*NL*
he
's
going
to
die
.
If
I
thought
it
,
I
should
never
be
happy
again
.
I
*NL*
would
n't
cut
a
boy
off
:
no
,
not
even
Brittles
here
;
not
for
all
the
*NL*
plate
in
the
county
,
sir
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
's
not
the
point
,
'
said
the
doctor
,
mysteriously
.
`
Mr.
Giles
,
are
*NL*
you
a
Protestant
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
sir
,
I
hope
so
,
'
faltered
Mr.
Giles
,
who
had
turned
very
pale
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
what
are
_
you
_
,
boy
?
'
said
the
doctor
,
turning
sharply
upon
*NL*
Brittles
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Lord
bless
me
,
sir
!
'
replied
Brittles
,
starting
violently
;
`
I
'm
the
*NL*
same
as
Mr.
Giles
,
sir
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Then
tell
me
this
,
'
said
the
doctor
,
`
both
of
you
,
both
of
you
!
Are
*NL*
you
going
to
take
upon
yourselves
to
swear
,
that
that
boy
upstairs
is
*NL*
the
boy
that
was
put
through
the
little
window
last
night
?
Out
with
*NL*
it
!
Come
!
We
are
prepared
for
you
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
doctor
,
who
was
universally
considered
one
of
the
best-tempered
*NL*
creatures
on
earth
,
made
this
demand
in
such
a
dreadful
tone
of
anger
,
*NL*
that
Giles
and
Brittles
,
who
were
considerably
muddled
by
ale
and
*NL*
excitement
,
stared
at
each
other
in
a
state
of
stupefaction
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Pay
attention
to
the
reply
,
constable
,
will
you
?
'
said
the
doctor
,
*NL*
shaking
his
forefinger
with
great
solemnity
of
manner
,
and
tapping
the
*NL*
bridge
of
his
nose
with
it
,
to
bespeak
the
exercise
of
that
worthy
's
*NL*
utmost
acuteness
.
`
Something
may
come
of
this
before
long
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
constable
looked
as
wise
as
he
could
,
and
took
up
his
staff
of
*NL*
office
:
which
had
been
reclining
indolently
in
the
chimney-corner
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
's
a
simple
question
of
identity
,
you
will
observe
,
'
said
the
doctor
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
's
what
it
is
,
sir
,
'
replied
the
constable
,
coughing
with
great
*NL*
violence
;
for
he
had
finished
his
ale
in
a
hurry
,
and
some
of
it
had
*NL*
gone
the
wrong
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Here
's
the
house
broken
into
,
'
said
the
doctor
,
`
and
a
couple
of
men
*NL*
catch
one
moment
's
glimpse
of
a
boy
,
in
the
midst
of
gunpowder
smoke
,
*NL*
and
in
all
the
distraction
of
alarm
and
darkness
.
Here
's
a
boy
comes
*NL*
to
that
very
same
house
,
next
morning
,
and
because
he
happens
to
have
*NL*
his
arm
tied
up
,
these
men
lay
violent
hands
upon
him
--
by
doing
which
,
*NL*
they
place
his
life
in
great
danger
--
and
swear
he
is
the
thief
.
Now
,
*NL*
the
question
is
,
whether
these
men
are
justified
by
the
fact
;
if
not
,
*NL*
in
what
situation
do
they
place
themselves
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
constable
nodded
profoundly
.
He
said
,
if
that
was
n't
law
,
he
would
*NL*
be
glad
to
know
what
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
ask
you
again
,
'
thundered
the
doctor
,
`
are
you
,
on
your
solemn
*NL*
oaths
,
able
to
identify
that
boy
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
Brittles
looked
doubtfully
at
Mr.
Giles
;
Mr.
Giles
looked
doubtfully
at
*NL*
Brittles
;
the
constable
put
his
hand
behind
his
ear
,
to
catch
the
*NL*
reply
;
the
two
women
and
the
tinker
leaned
forward
to
listen
;
the
*NL*
doctor
glanced
keenly
round
;
when
a
ring
was
heard
at
the
gate
,
and
at
*NL*
the
same
moment
,
the
sound
of
wheels
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
's
the
runners
!
'
cried
Brittles
,
to
all
appearance
much
relieved
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
what
?
'
exclaimed
the
doctor
,
aghast
in
his
turn
.

The

replied
Brittles
,
taking
up
a
candle
;
*NL*
`
me
and
Mr.
Giles
sent
for
'em
this
morning
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
?
'
cried
the
doctor
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
'
replied
Brittles
;
'
I
sent
a
message
up
by
the
coachman
,
and
I
*NL*
only
wonder
they
were
n't
here
before
,
sir
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
did
,
did
you
?
Then
confound
your
--
slow
coaches
down
here
;
that
's
*NL*
all
,

the
doctor
,
walking
away

CHAPTER
XXXI
*NL*
*NL*
INVOLVES
A
CRITICAL
POSITION
*NL*
*NL*
`
Who
's
that
?
'
inquired
Brittles
,
opening
the
door
a
little
way
,
with
*NL*
the
chain
up
,
and
peeping
out
,
shading
the
candle
with
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Open
the
door
,
'
replied
a
man
outside
;
`
it
's
the
officers
from
Bow
*NL*
Street
,
as
was
sent
to
to-day
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Much
comforted
by
this
assurance
,
Brittles
opened
the
door
to
its
full
*NL*
width
,
and
confronted
a
portly
man
in
a
great-coat
;
who
walked
in
,
*NL*
without
saying
anything
more
,
and
wiped
his
shoes
on
the
mat
,
as
coolly
*NL*
as
if
he
lived
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Just
send
somebody
out
to
relieve
my
mate
,
will
you
,
young
man
?
'
said
*NL*
the
officer
;
`
he
's
in
the
gig
,
a-minding
the
prad
.
Have
you
got
a
*NL*
coach
`
us
here
,
that
you
could
put
it
up
in
,
for
five
or
ten
minutes
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
Brittles
replying
in
the
affirmative
,
and
pointing
out
the
building
,
*NL*
the
portly
man
stepped
back
to
the
garden-gate
,
and
helped
his
*NL*
companion
to
put
up
the
gig
:
while
Brittles
lighted
them
,
in
a
state
*NL*
of
great
admiration
.
This
done
,
they
returned
to
the
house
,
and
,
being
*NL*
shown
into
a
parlour
,
took
off
their
great-coats
and
hats
,
and
showed
*NL*
like
what
they
were
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
who
had
knocked
at
the
door
,
was
a
stout
personage
of
middle
*NL*
height
,
aged
about
fifty
:
with
shiny
black
hair
,
cropped
pretty
close
;
*NL*
half-whiskers
,
a
round
face
,
and
sharp
eyes
.
The
other
was
a
*NL*
red-headed
,
bony
man
,
in
top-boots
;
with
a
rather
ill-favoured
*NL*
countenance
,
and
a
turned-up
sinister-looking
nose
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Tell
your
governor
that
Blathers
and
Duff
is
here
,
will
you
?
'
said
the
*NL*
stouter
man
,
smoothing
down
his
hair
,
and
laying
a
pair
of
handcuffs
on
*NL*
the
table
.
`
Oh
!
Good-evening
,
master
.
Can
I
have
a
word
or
two
with
*NL*
you
in
private
,
if
you
please
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
addressed
to
Mr.
Losberne
,
who
now
made
his
appearance
;
that
*NL*
gentleman
,
motioning
Brittles
to
retire
,
brought
in
the
two
ladies
,
and
*NL*
shut
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
This
is
the
lady
of
the
house
,
'
said
Mr.
Losberne
,
motioning
towards
*NL*
Mrs.
Maylie
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Blathers
made
a
bow
.
Being
desired
to
sit
down
,
he
put
his
hat
on
*NL*
the
floor
,
and
taking
a
chair
,
motioned
to
Duff
to
do
the
same
.
The
*NL*
latter
gentleman
,
who
did
not
appear
quite
so
much
accustomed
to
good
*NL*
society
,
or
quite
so
much
at
his
ease
in
it
--
one
of
the
two
--
seated
*NL*
himself
,
after
undergoing
several
muscular
affections
of
the
limbs
,
and
*NL*
the
head
of
his
stick
into
his
mouth
,
with
some
embarrassment
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Now
,
with
regard
to
this
here
robbery
,
master
,
'
said
Blathers
.
`
What
*NL*
are
the
circumstances
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Losberne
,
who
appeared
desirous
of
gaining
time
,
recounted
them
at
*NL*
great
length
,
and
with
much
circumlocution
.
Messrs.
Blathers
and
Duff
*NL*
looked
very
knowing
meanwhile
,
and
occasionally
exchanged
a
nod
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
ca
n't
say
,
for
certain
,
till
I
see
the
work
,
of
course
,
'
said
*NL*
Blathers
;
`
but
my
opinion
at
once
is
,
--
I
do
n't
mind
committing
myself
*NL*
to
that
extent
,
--
that
this
was
n't
done
by
a
yokel
;
eh
,
Duff
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Certainly
not
,
'
replied
Duff
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
,
translating
the
word
yokel
for
the
benefit
of
the
ladies
,
I
*NL*
apprehend
your
meaning
to
be
,
that
this
attempt
was
not
made
by
a
*NL*
countryman
?
'
said
Mr.
Losberne
,
with
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
's
it
,
master
,
'
replied
Blathers
.
`
This
is
all
about
the
robbery
,
*NL*
is
it
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
All
,
'
replied
the
doctor
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Now
,
what
is
this
,
about
this
here
boy
that
the
servants
are
a-talking
*NL*
on
?
'
said
Blathers
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Nothing
at
all
,
'
replied
the
doctor
.
`
One
of
the
frightened
servants
*NL*
chose
to
take
it
into
his
head
,
that
he
had
something
to
do
with
this
*NL*
attempt
to
break
into
the
house
;
but
it
's
nonsense
:
sheer
absurdity
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Wery
easy
disposed
of
,
if
it
is
,
'
remarked
Duff
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
he
says
is
quite
correct
,
'
observed
Blathers
,
nodding
his
head
in
*NL*
a
confirmatory
way
,
and
playing
carelessly
with
the
handcuffs
,
as
if
*NL*
they
were
a
pair
of
castanets
.
`
Who
is
the
boy
?
What
account
does
he
*NL*
give
of
himself
?
Where
did
he
come
from
?
He
did
n't
drop
out
of
the
*NL*
clouds
,
did
he
,
master
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Of
course
not
,
'
replied
the
doctor
,
with
a
nervous
glance
at
the
two
*NL*
ladies
.
'
I
know
his
whole
history
:
but
we
can
talk
about
that
*NL*
presently
.
You
would
like
,
first
,
to
see
the
place
where
the
thieves
*NL*
made
their
attempt
,
I
suppose
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Certainly
,
'
rejoined
Mr.
Blathers
.
`
We
had
better
inspect
the
*NL*
premises
first
,
and
examine
the
servants
afterwards
.
That
's
the
usual
*NL*
way
of
doing
business
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Lights
were
then
procured
;
and
Messrs.
Blathers
and
Duff
,
attended
by
*NL*
the
native
constable
,
Brittles
,
Giles
,
and
everybody
else
in
short
,
*NL*
went
into
the
little
room
at
the
end
of
the
passage
and
looked
out
at
*NL*
the
window
;
and
afterwards
went
round
by
way
of
the
lawn
,
and
looked
in
*NL*
at
the
window
;
and
after
that
,
had
a
candle
handed
out
to
inspect
the
*NL*
shutter
with
;
and
after
that
,
a
lantern
to
trace
the
footsteps
with
;
*NL*
and
after
that
,
a
pitchfork
to
poke
the
bushes
with
.
This
done
,
amidst
*NL*
the
breathless
interest
of
all
beholders
,
they
came
in
again
;
and
Mr.
*NL*
Giles
and
Brittles
were
put
through
a
melodramatic
representation
of
*NL*
their
share
in
the
previous
night
's
adventures
:
which
they
performed
*NL*
some
six
times
over
:
contradicting
each
other
,
in
not
more
than
one
*NL*
important
respect
,
the
first
time
,
and
in
not
more
than
a
dozen
the
*NL*
last
.
This
consummation
being
arrived
at
,
Blathers
and
Duff
cleared
*NL*
the
room
,
and
held
a
long
council
together
,
compared
with
which
,
for
*NL*
secrecy
and
solemnity
,
a
consultation
of
great
doctors
on
the
knottiest
*NL*
point
in
medicine
,
would
be
mere
child
's
play
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
the
doctor
walked
up
and
down
the
next
room
in
a
very
uneasy
*NL*
state
;
and
Mrs.
Maylie
and
Rose
looked
on
,
with
anxious
faces
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Upon
my
word
,
'
he
said
,
making
a
halt
,
after
a
great
number
of
very
*NL*
rapid
turns
,
'
I
hardly
know
what
to
do
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Surely
,
'
said
Rose
,
`
the
poor
child
's
story
,
faithfully
repeated
to
*NL*
these
men
,
will
be
sufficient
to
exonerate
him
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
doubt
it
,
my
dear
young
lady
,
'
said
the
doctor
,
shaking
his
head
.
*NL*
'
I
do
n't
think
it
would
exonerate
him
,
either
with
them
,
or
with
legal
*NL*
functionaries
of
a
higher
grade
.
What
is
he
,
after
all
,
they
would
*NL*
say
?
A
runaway
.
Judged
by
mere
worldly
considerations
and
*NL*
probabilities
,
his
story
is
a
very
doubtful
one
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
believe
it
,
surely
?
'
interrupted
Rose
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
_
I
_
believe
it
,
strange
as
it
is
;
and
perhaps
I
may
be
an
old
fool
for
*NL*
doing
so
,
'
rejoined
the
doctor
;
`
but
I
do
n't
think
it
is
exactly
the
*NL*
tale
for
a
practical
police-officer
,
nevertheless
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
not
?
'
demanded
Rose
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Because
,
my
pretty
cross-examiner
,
'
replied
the
doctor
:
`
because
,
*NL*
viewed
with
their
eyes
,
there
are
many
ugly
points
about
it
;
he
can
*NL*
only
prove
the
parts
that
look
ill
,
and
none
of
those
that
look
well
.
*NL*
Confound
the
fellows
,
they
_
will
_
have
the
why
and
the
wherefore
,
and
*NL*
will
take
nothing
for
granted
.
On
his
own
showing
,
you
see
,
he
has
*NL*
been
the
companion
of
thieves
for
some
time
past
;
he
has
been
carried
*NL*
to
a
police-officer
,
on
a
charge
of
picking
a
gentleman
's
pocket
;
he
*NL*
has
been
taken
away
,
forcibly
,
from
that
gentleman
's
house
,
to
a
place
*NL*
which
he
can
not
describe
or
point
out
,
and
of
the
situation
of
which
he
*NL*
has
not
the
remotest
idea
.
He
is
brought
down
to
Chertsey
,
by
men
who
*NL*
seem
to
have
taken
a
violent
fancy
to
him
,
whether
he
will
or
no
;
and
*NL*
is
put
through
a
window
to
rob
a
house
;
and
then
,
just
at
the
very
*NL*
moment
when
he
is
going
to
alarm
the
inmates
,
and
so
do
the
very
thing
*NL*
that
would
set
him
all
to
rights
,
there
rushes
into
the
way
,
a
*NL*
blundering
dog
of
a
half-bred
butler
,
and
shoots
him
!
As
if
on
purpose
*NL*
to
prevent
his
doing
any
good
for
himself
!
Do
n't
you
see
all
this
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
see
it
,
of
course
,
'
replied
Rose
,
smiling
at
the
doctor
's
*NL*
impetuosity
;
`
but
still
I
do
not
see
anything
in
it
,
to
criminate
the
*NL*
poor
child
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
'
replied
the
doctor
;
`
of
course
not
!
Bless
the
bright
eyes
of
*NL*
your
sex
!
They
never
see
,
whether
for
good
or
bad
,
more
than
one
side
*NL*
of
any
question
;
and
that
is
,
always
,
the
one
which
first
presents
*NL*
itself
to
them
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Having
given
vent
to
this
result
of
experience
,
the
doctor
put
his
*NL*
hands
into
his
pockets
,
and
walked
up
and
down
the
room
with
even
*NL*
greater
rapidity
than
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
more
I
think
of
it
,
'
said
the
doctor
,
`
the
more
I
see
that
it
will
*NL*
occasion
endless
trouble
and
difficulty
if
we
put
these
men
in
*NL*
possession
of
the
boy
's
real
story
.
I
am
certain
it
will
not
be
*NL*
believed
;
and
even
if
they
can
do
nothing
to
him
in
the
end
,
still
the
*NL*
dragging
it
forward
,
and
giving
publicity
to
all
the
doubts
that
will
*NL*
be
cast
upon
it
,
must
interfere
,
materially
,
with
your
benevolent
plan
*NL*
of
rescuing
him
from
misery
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
!
what
is
to
be
done
?
'
cried
Rose
.
`
Dear
,
dear
!
why
did
they
send
*NL*
for
these
people
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
indeed
!
'
exclaimed
Mrs.
Maylie
.
'
I
would
not
have
had
them
here
,
*NL*
for
the
world
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
All
I
know
is
,
'
said
Mr.
Losberne
,
at
last
:
sitting
down
with
a
kind
*NL*
of
desperate
calmness
,
`
that
we
must
try
and
carry
it
off
with
a
bold
*NL*
face
.
The
object
is
a
good
one
,
and
that
must
be
our
excuse
.
The
boy
*NL*
has
strong
symptoms
of
fever
upon
him
,
and
is
in
no
condition
to
be
*NL*
talked
to
any
more
;
that
's
one
comfort
.
We
must
make
the
best
of
it
;
*NL*
and
if
bad
be
the
best
,
it
is
no
fault
of
ours
.
Come
in
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
master
,
'
said
Blathers
,
entering
the
room
followed
by
his
*NL*
colleague
,
and
making
the
door
fast
,
before
he
said
any
more
.
`
This
*NL*
war
n't
a
put-up
thing
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
what
the
devil
's
a
put-up
thing
?
'
demanded
the
doctor
,
impatiently
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
We
call
it
a
put-up
robbery
,
ladies
,
'
said
Blathers
,
turning
to
them
,
*NL*
as
if
he
pitied
their
ignorance
,
but
had
a
contempt
for
the
doctor
's
,
*NL*
`
when
the
servants
is
in
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Nobody
suspected
them
,
in
this
case
,
'
said
Mrs.
Maylie
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Wery
likely
not
,
ma'am
,
'
replied
Blathers
;
`
but
they
might
have
been
*NL*
in
it
,
for
all
that
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
More
likely
on
that
wery
account
,
'
said
Duff
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
We
find
it
was
a
town
hand
,
'
said
Blathers
,
continuing
his
report
;
*NL*
`
for
the
style
of
work
is
first-rate
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Wery
pretty
indeed
it
is
,
'
remarked
Duff
,
in
an
undertone
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
There
was
two
of
'em
in
it
,
'
continued
Blathers
;
`
and
they
had
a
boy
*NL*
with
'em
;
that
's
plain
from
the
size
of
the
window
.
That
's
all
to
be
*NL*
said
at
present
.
We
'll
see
this
lad
that
you
've
got
upstairs
at
once
,
*NL*
if
you
please
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Perhaps
they
will
take
something
to
drink
first
,
Mrs.
Maylie
?
'
said
*NL*
the
doctor
:
his
face
brightening
,
as
if
some
new
thought
had
occurred
*NL*
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
!
to
be
sure
!
'
exclaimed
Rose
,
eagerly
.
`
You
shall
have
it
*NL*
immediately
,
if
you
will
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
thank
you
,
miss
!
'
said
Blathers
,
drawing
his
coat-sleeve
across
*NL*
his
mouth
;
`
it
's
dry
work
,
this
sort
of
duty
.
Anythink
that
's
handy
,
*NL*
miss
;
do
n't
put
yourself
out
of
the
way
,
on
our
accounts
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
shall
it
be
?
'
asked
the
doctor
,
following
the
young
lady
to
the
*NL*
sideboard
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
A
little
drop
of
spirits
,
master
,
if
it
's
all
the
same
,
'
replied
*NL*
Blathers
.
`
It
's
a
cold
ride
from
London
,
ma'am
;
and
I
always
find
that
*NL*
spirits
comes
home
warmer
to
the
feelings
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
This
interesting
communication
was
addressed
to
Mrs.
Maylie
,
who
*NL*
received
it
very
graciously
.
While
it
was
being
conveyed
to
her
,
the
*NL*
doctor
slipped
out
of
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ah
!
'
said
Mr.
Blathers
:
not
holding
his
wine-glass
by
the
stem
,
but
*NL*
grasping
the
bottom
between
the
thumb
and
forefinger
of
his
left
hand
:
*NL*
and
placing
it
in
front
of
his
chest
;
'
I
have
seen
a
good
many
pieces
*NL*
of
business
like
this
,
in
my
time
,
ladies
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
crack
down
in
the
back
lane
at
Edmonton
,
Blathers
,
'
said
Mr.
*NL*
Duff
,
assisting
his
colleague
's
memory
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
was
something
in
this
way
,
war
n't
it
?
'
rejoined
Mr.
Blathers
;
*NL*
`
that
was
done
by
Conkey
Chickweed
,
that
was
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
always
gave
that
to
him
'
replied
Duff
.
`
It
was
the
Family
Pet
,
I
*NL*
tell
you
.
Conkey
had
n't
any
more
to
do
with
it
than
I
had
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Get
out
!
'
retorted
Mr.
Blathers
;
'
I
know
better
.
Do
you
mind
that
*NL*
time
when
Conkey
was
robbed
of
his
money
,
though
?
What
a
start
that
*NL*
was
!
Better
than
any
novel-book
_
I
_
ever
see
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
was
that
?
'
inquired
Rose
:
anxious
to
encourage
any
symptoms
of
*NL*
good-humour
in
the
unwelcome
visitors
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
was
a
robbery
,
miss
,
that
hardly
anybody
would
have
been
down
*NL*
upon
,
'
said
Blathers
.
`
This
here
Conkey
Chickweed
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Conkey
means
Nosey
,
ma'am
,
'
interposed
Duff
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Of
course
the
lady
knows
that
,
do
n't
she
?
'
demanded
Mr.
Blathers
.
*NL*
`
Always
interrupting
,
you
are
,
partner
!
This
here
Conkey
Chickweed
,
*NL*
miss
,
kept
a
public-house
over
Battlebridge
way
,
and
he
had
a
cellar
,
*NL*
where
a
good
many
young
lords
went
to
see
cock-fighting
,
and
*NL*
badger-drawing
,
and
that
;
and
a
wery
intellectual
manner
the
sports
was
*NL*
conducted
in
,
for
I
've
seen
'em
off
`
en
.
He
war
n't
one
of
the
family
,
*NL*
at
that
time
;
and
one
night
he
was
robbed
of
three
hundred
and
*NL*
twenty-seven
guineas
in
a
canvas
bag
,
that
was
stole
out
of
his
bedroom
*NL*
in
the
dead
of
night
,
by
a
tall
man
with
a
black
patch
over
his
eye
,
*NL*
who
had
concealed
himself
under
the
bed
,
and
after
committing
the
*NL*
robbery
,
jumped
slap
out
of
window
:
which
was
only
a
story
high
.
He
*NL*
was
wery
quick
about
it
.
But
Conkey
was
quick
,
too
;
for
he
fired
a
*NL*
blunderbuss
arter
him
,
and
roused
the
neighbourhood
.
They
set
up
a
*NL*
hue-and-cry
,
directly
,
and
when
they
came
to
look
about
'em
,
found
that
*NL*
Conkey
had
hit
the
robber
;
for
there
was
traces
of
blood
,
all
the
way
*NL*
to
some
palings
a
good
distance
off
;
and
there
they
lost
'em
.
However
,
*NL*
he
had
made
off
with
the
blunt
;
and
,
consequently
,
the
name
of
Mr.
*NL*
Chickweed
,
licensed
witler
,
appeared
in
the
Gazette
among
the
other
*NL*
bankrupts
;
and
all
manner
of
benefits
and
subscriptions
,
and
I
do
n't
*NL*
know
what
all
,
was
got
up
for
the
poor
man
,
who
was
in
a
wery
low
state
*NL*
of
mind
about
his
loss
,
and
went
up
and
down
the
streets
,
for
three
or
*NL*
four
days
,
a
pulling
his
hair
off
in
such
a
desperate
manner
that
many
*NL*
people
was
afraid
he
might
be
going
to
make
away
with
himself
.
One
day
*NL*
he
came
up
to
the
office
,
all
in
a
hurry
,
and
had
a
private
interview
*NL*
with
the
magistrate
,
who
,
after
a
deal
of
talk
,
rings
the
bell
,
and
*NL*
orders
Jem
Spyers
in
-LRB-
Jem
was
a
active
officer
-RRB-
,
and
tells
him
to
go
*NL*
and
assist
Mr.
Chickweed
in
apprehending
the
man
as
robbed
his
house
.
*NL*
``
I
see
him
,
Spyers
,
''
said
Chickweed
,
``
pass
my
house
yesterday
morning
,
''
*NL*
``
Why
did
n't
you
up
,
and
collar
him
!
''
says
Spyers
.
``
I
was
so
struck
all
*NL*
of
a
heap
,
that
you
might
have
fractured
my
skull
with
a
toothpick
,
''
*NL*
says
the
poor
man
;
``
but
we
're
sure
to
have
him
;
for
between
ten
and
*NL*
eleven
o'clock
at
night
he
passed
again
.
''
Spyers
no
sooner
heard
this
,
*NL*
than
he
put
some
clean
linen
and
a
comb
,
in
his
pocket
,
in
case
he
*NL*
should
have
to
stop
a
day
or
two
;
and
away
he
goes
,
and
sets
himself
*NL*
down
at
one
of
the
public-house
windows
behind
the
little
red
curtain
,
*NL*
with
his
hat
on
,
all
ready
to
bolt
out
,
at
a
moment
's
notice
.
He
was
*NL*
smoking
his
pipe
here
,
late
at
night
,
when
all
of
a
sudden
Chickweed
*NL*
roars
out
,
``
Here
he
is
!
Stop
thief
!
Murder
!
''
Jem
Spyers
dashes
out
;
*NL*
and
there
he
sees
Chickweed
,
a-tearing
down
the
street
full
cry
.
Away
*NL*
goes
Spyers
;
on
goes
Chickweed
;
round
turns
the
people
;
everybody
roars
*NL*
out
,
``
Thieves
!
''
and
Chickweed
himself
keeps
on
shouting
,
all
the
time
,
*NL*
like
mad
.
Spyers
loses
sight
of
him
a
minute
as
he
turns
a
corner
;
*NL*
shoots
round
;
sees
a
little
crowd
;
dives
in
;
``
Which
is
the
man
?
''
*NL*
``
D
--
me
!
''
says
Chickweed
,
``
I
've
lost
him
again
!
''
It
was
a
remarkable
*NL*
occurrence
,
but
he
war
n't
to
be
seen
nowhere
,
so
they
went
back
to
the
*NL*
public-house
.
Next
morning
,
Spyers
took
his
old
place
,
and
looked
out
,
*NL*
from
behind
the
curtain
,
for
a
tall
man
with
a
black
patch
over
his
*NL*
eye
,
till
his
own
two
eyes
ached
again
.
At
last
,
he
could
n't
help
*NL*
shutting
'em
,
to
ease
'em
a
minute
;
and
the
very
moment
he
did
so
,
he
*NL*
hears
Chickweed
a-roaring
out
,
``
Here
he
is
!
''
Off
he
starts
once
more
,
*NL*
with
Chickweed
half-way
down
the
street
ahead
of
him
;
and
after
twice
*NL*
as
long
a
run
as
the
yesterday
's
one
,
the
man
's
lost
again
!
This
was
*NL*
done
,
once
or
twice
more
,
till
one-half
the
neighbours
gave
out
that
*NL*
Mr.
Chickweed
had
been
robbed
by
the
devil
,
who
was
playing
tricks
with
*NL*
him
arterwards
;
and
the
other
half
,
that
poor
Mr.
Chickweed
had
gone
*NL*
mad
with
grief
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
did
Jem
Spyers
say
?
'
inquired
the
doctor
;
who
had
returned
to
the
*NL*
room
shortly
after
the
commencement
of
the
story
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Jem
Spyers
,
'
resumed
the
officer
,
`
for
a
long
time
said
nothing
at
*NL*
all
,
and
listened
to
everything
without
seeming
to
,
which
showed
he
*NL*
understood
his
business
.
But
,
one
morning
,
he
walked
into
the
bar
,
and
*NL*
taking
out
his
snuffbox
,
says
``
Chickweed
,
I
've
found
out
who
done
this
*NL*
here
robbery
.
''
``
Have
you
?
''
said
Chickweed
.
``
Oh
,
my
dear
Spyers
,
only
*NL*
let
me
have
wengeance
,
and
I
shall
die
contented
!
Oh
,
my
dear
Spyers
,
*NL*
where
is
the
villain
!
''
``
Come
!
''
said
Spyers
,
offering
him
a
pinch
of
*NL*
snuff
,
``
none
of
that
gammon
!
You
did
it
yourself
.
''
So
he
had
;
and
a
*NL*
good
bit
of
money
he
had
made
by
it
,
too
;
and
nobody
would
never
have
*NL*
found
it
out
,
if
he
had
n't
been
so
precious
anxious
to
keep
up
*NL*
appearances
!
'
said
Mr.
Blathers
,
putting
down
his
wine-glass
,
and
*NL*
clinking
the
handcuffs
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Very
curious
,
indeed
,
'
observed
the
doctor
.
`
Now
,
if
you
please
,
you
*NL*
can
walk
upstairs
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
If
_
you
_
please
,
sir
,
'
returned
Mr.
Blathers
.
Closely
following
Mr.
*NL*
Losberne
,
the
two
officers
ascended
to
Oliver
's
bedroom
;
Mr.
Giles
*NL*
preceding
the
party
,
with
a
lighted
candle
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oliver
had
been
dozing
;
but
looked
worse
,
and
was
more
feverish
than
he
*NL*
had
appeared
yet
.
Being
assisted
by
the
doctor
,
he
managed
to
sit
up
*NL*
in
bed
for
a
minute
or
so
;
and
looked
at
the
strangers
without
at
all
*NL*
understanding
what
was
going
forward
--
in
fact
,
without
seeming
to
*NL*
recollect
where
he
was
,
or
what
had
been
passing
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
This
,
'
said
Mr.
Losberne
,
speaking
softly
,
but
with
great
vehemence
*NL*
notwithstanding
,
`
this
is
the
lad
,
who
,
being
accidently
wounded
by
a
*NL*
spring-gun
in
some
boyish
trespass
on
Mr.
What-d
'
ye-call-him
's
*NL*
grounds
,
at
the
back
here
,
comes
to
the
house
for
assistance
this
*NL*
morning
,
and
is
immediately
laid
hold
of
and
maltreated
,
by
that
*NL*
ingenious
gentleman
with
the
candle
in
his
hand
:
who
has
placed
his
*NL*
life
in
considerable
danger
,
as
I
can
professionally
certify
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Messrs.
Blathers
and
Duff
looked
at
Mr.
Giles
,
as
he
was
thus
*NL*
recommended
to
their
notice
.
The
bewildered
butler
gazed
from
them
*NL*
towards
Oliver
,
and
from
Oliver
towards
Mr.
Losberne
,
with
a
most
*NL*
ludicrous
mixture
of
fear
and
perplexity
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
do
n't
mean
to
deny
that
,
I
suppose
?
'
said
the
doctor
,
laying
*NL*
Oliver
gently
down
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
was
all
done
for
the
--
for
the
best
,
sir
,
'
answered
Giles
.
'
I
am
*NL*
sure
I
thought
it
was
the
boy
,
or
I
would
n't
have
meddled
with
him
.
I
*NL*
am
not
of
an
inhuman
disposition
,
sir
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Thought
it
was
what
boy
?
'
inquired
the
senior
officer
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
housebreaker
's
boy
,
sir
!
'
replied
Giles
.
`
They
--
they
certainly
*NL*
had
a
boy
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
?
Do
you
think
so
now
?
'
inquired
Blathers
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Think
what
,
now
?
'
replied
Giles
,
looking
vacantly
at
his
questioner
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Think
it
's
the
same
boy
,
Stupid-head
?
'
rejoined
Blathers
,
impatiently
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
do
n't
know
;
I
really
do
n't
know
,
'
said
Giles
,
with
a
rueful
*NL*
countenance
.
'
I
could
n't
swear
to
him
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
do
you
think
?
'
asked
Mr.
Blathers
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
do
n't
know
what
to
think
,
'
replied
poor
Giles
.
'
I
do
n't
think
it
is
*NL*
the
boy
;
indeed
,
I
'm
almost
certain
that
it
is
n't
.
You
know
it
ca
n't
*NL*
be
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Has
this
man
been
a-drinking
,
sir
?
'
inquired
Blathers
,
turning
to
the
*NL*
doctor
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
a
precious
muddle-headed
chap
you
are
!
'
said
Duff
,
addressing
Mr.
*NL*
Giles
,
with
supreme
contempt
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Losberne
had
been
feeling
the
patient
's
pulse
during
this
short
*NL*
dialogue
;
but
he
now
rose
from
the
chair
by
the
bedside
,
and
remarked
,
*NL*
that
if
the
officers
had
any
doubts
upon
the
subject
,
they
would
*NL*
perhaps
like
to
step
into
the
next
room
,
and
have
Brittles
before
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Acting
upon
this
suggestion
,
they
adjourned
to
a
neighbouring
*NL*
apartment
,
where
Mr.
Brittles
,
being
called
in
,
involved
himself
and
*NL*
his
respected
superior
in
such
a
wonderful
maze
of
fresh
contradictions
*NL*
and
impossibilities
,
as
tended
to
throw
no
particular
light
on
*NL*
anything
,
but
the
fact
of
his
own
strong
mystification
;
except
,
indeed
,
*NL*
his
declarations
that
he
should
n't
know
the
real
boy
,
if
he
were
put
*NL*
before
him
that
instant
;
that
he
had
only
taken
Oliver
to
be
he
,
*NL*
because
Mr.
Giles
had
said
he
was
;
and
that
Mr.
Giles
had
,
five
minutes
*NL*
previously
,
admitted
in
the
kitchen
,
that
he
began
to
be
very
much
*NL*
afraid
he
had
been
a
little
too
hasty
.
*NL*
*NL*
Among
other
ingenious
surmises
,
the
question
was
then
raised
,
whether
*NL*
Mr.
Giles
had
really
hit
anybody
;
and
upon
examination
of
the
fellow
*NL*
pistol
to
that
which
he
had
fired
,
it
turned
out
to
have
no
more
*NL*
destructive
loading
than
gunpowder
and
brown
paper
:
a
discovery
which
*NL*
made
a
considerable
impression
on
everybody
but
the
doctor
,
who
had
*NL*
drawn
the
ball
about
ten
minutes
before
.
Upon
no
one
,
however
,
did
it
*NL*
make
a
greater
impression
than
on
Mr.
Giles
himself
;
who
,
after
*NL*
labouring
,
for
some
hours
,
under
the
fear
of
having
mortally
wounded
a
*NL*
fellow-creature
,
eagerly
caught
at
this
new
idea
,
and
favoured
it
to
*NL*
the
utmost
.
Finally
,
the
officers
,
without
troubling
themselves
very
*NL*
much
about
Oliver
,
left
the
Chertsey
constable
in
the
house
,
and
took
*NL*
up
their
rest
for
that
night
in
the
town
;
promising
to
return
the
next
*NL*
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
the
next
morning
,
there
came
a
rumour
,
that
two
men
and
a
boy
were
*NL*
in
the
cage
at
Kingston
,
who
had
been
apprehended
over
night
under
*NL*
suspicious
circumstances
;
and
to
Kingston
Messrs.
Blathers
and
Duff
*NL*
journeyed
accordingly
.
The
suspicious
circumstances
,
however
,
resolving
*NL*
themselves
,
on
investigation
,
into
the
one
fact
,
that
they
had
been
*NL*
discovered
sleeping
under
a
haystack
;
which
,
although
a
great
crime
,
is
*NL*
only
punishable
by
imprisonment
,
and
is
,
in
the
merciful
eye
of
the
*NL*
English
law
,
and
its
comprehensive
love
of
all
the
King
's
subjects
,
*NL*
held
to
be
no
satisfactory
proof
,
in
the
absence
of
all
other
evidence
,
*NL*
that
the
sleeper
,
or
sleepers
,
have
committed
burglary
accompanied
with
*NL*
violence
,
and
have
therefore
rendered
themselves
liable
to
the
*NL*
punishment
of
death
;
Messrs.
Blathers
and
Duff
came
back
again
,
as
wise
*NL*
as
they
went
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
short
,
after
some
more
examination
,
and
a
great
deal
more
*NL*
conversation
,
a
neighbouring
magistrate
was
readily
induced
to
take
the
*NL*
joint
bail
of
Mrs.
Maylie
and
Mr.
Losberne
for
Oliver
's
appearance
if
*NL*
he
should
ever
be
called
upon
;
and
Blathers
and
Duff
,
being
rewarded
*NL*
with
a
couple
of
guineas
,
returned
to
town
with
divided
opinions
on
the
*NL*
subject
of
their
expedition
:
the
latter
gentleman
on
a
mature
*NL*
consideration
of
all
the
circumstances
,
inclining
to
the
belief
that
*NL*
the
burglarious
attempt
had
originated
with
the
Family
Pet
;
and
the
*NL*
former
being
equally
disposed
to
concede
the
full
merit
of
it
to
the
*NL*
great
Mr.
Conkey
Chickweed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
Oliver
gradually
throve
and
prospered
under
the
united
care
*NL*
of
Mrs.
Maylie
,
Rose
,
and
the
kind-hearted
Mr.
Losberne
.
If
fervent
*NL*
prayers
,
gushing
from
hearts
overcharged
with
gratitude
,
be
heard
in
*NL*
heaven
--
and
if
they
be
not
,
what
prayers
are
!
--
the
blessings
which
the
*NL*
orphan
child
called
down
upon
them
,
sunk
into
their
souls
,
diffusing
*NL*
peace
and
happiness
.

CHAPTER
XXXII
*NL*
*NL*
OF
THE
HAPPY
LIFE
OLIVER
BEGAN
TO
LEAD
WITH
HIS
KIND
FRIENDS
*NL*
*NL*
Oliver
's
ailings
were
neither
slight
nor
few
.
In
addition
to
the
pain
*NL*
and
delay
attendant
on
a
broken
limb
,
his
exposure
to
the
wet
and
cold
*NL*
had
brought
on
fever
and
ague
:
which
hung
about
him
for
many
weeks
,
*NL*
and
reduced
him
sadly
.
But
,
at
length
,
he
began
,
by
slow
degrees
,
to
*NL*
get
better
,
and
to
be
able
to
say
sometimes
,
in
a
few
tearful
words
,
*NL*
how
deeply
he
felt
the
goodness
of
the
two
sweet
ladies
,
and
how
*NL*
ardently
he
hoped
that
when
he
grew
strong
and
well
again
,
he
could
do
*NL*
something
to
show
his
gratitude
;
only
something
,
which
would
let
them
*NL*
see
the
love
and
duty
with
which
his
breast
was
full
;
something
,
*NL*
however
slight
,
which
would
prove
to
them
that
their
gentle
kindness
*NL*
had
not
been
cast
away
;
but
that
the
poor
boy
whom
their
charity
had
*NL*
rescued
from
misery
,
or
death
,
was
eager
to
serve
them
with
his
whole
*NL*
heart
and
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Poor
fellow
!
'
said
Rose
,
when
Oliver
had
been
one
day
feebly
*NL*
endeavouring
to
utter
the
words
of
thankfulness
that
rose
to
his
pale
*NL*
lips
;
`
you
shall
have
many
opportunities
of
serving
us
,
if
you
will
.
*NL*
We
are
going
into
the
country
,
and
my
aunt
intends
that
you
shall
*NL*
accompany
us
.
The
quiet
place
,
the
pure
air
,
and
all
the
pleasure
and
*NL*
beauties
of
spring
,
will
restore
you
in
a
few
days
.
We
will
employ
you
*NL*
in
a
hundred
ways
,
when
you
can
bear
the
trouble
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
trouble
!
'
cried
Oliver
.
`
Oh
!
dear
lady
,
if
I
could
but
work
for
*NL*
you
;
if
I
could
only
give
you
pleasure
by
watering
your
flowers
,
or
*NL*
watching
your
birds
,
or
running
up
and
down
the
whole
day
long
,
to
make
*NL*
you
happy
;
what
would
I
give
to
do
it
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
shall
give
nothing
at
all
,
'
said
Miss
Maylie
,
smiling
;
`
for
,
as
I
*NL*
told
you
before
,
we
shall
employ
you
in
a
hundred
ways
;
and
if
you
only
*NL*
take
half
the
trouble
to
please
us
,
that
you
promise
now
,
you
will
make
*NL*
me
very
happy
indeed
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Happy
,
ma'am
!
'
cried
Oliver
;
`
how
kind
of
you
to
say
so
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
will
make
me
happier
than
I
can
tell
you
,
'
replied
the
young
lady
.
*NL*
`
To
think
that
my
dear
good
aunt
should
have
been
the
means
of
rescuing
*NL*
any
one
from
such
sad
misery
as
you
have
described
to
us
,
would
be
an
*NL*
unspeakable
pleasure
to
me
;
but
to
know
that
the
object
of
her
goodness
*NL*
and
compassion
was
sincerely
grateful
and
attached
,
in
consequence
,
*NL*
would
delight
me
,
more
than
you
can
well
imagine
.
Do
you
understand
*NL*
me
?
'
she
inquired
,
watching
Oliver
's
thoughtful
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
yes
,
ma'am
,
yes
!
'
replied
Oliver
eagerly
;
`
but
I
was
thinking
that
*NL*
I
am
ungrateful
now
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
To
whom
?
'
inquired
the
young
lady
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
To
the
kind
gentleman
,
and
the
dear
old
nurse
,
who
took
so
much
care
*NL*
of
me
before
,
'
rejoined
Oliver
.
`
If
they
knew
how
happy
I
am
,
they
*NL*
would
be
pleased
,
I
am
sure
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
am
sure
they
would
,
'
rejoined
Oliver
's
benefactress
;
`
and
Mr.
*NL*
Losberne
has
already
been
kind
enough
to
promise
that
when
you
are
well
*NL*
enough
to
bear
the
journey
,
he
will
carry
you
to
see
them
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Has
he
,
ma'am
?
'
cried
Oliver
,
his
face
brightening
with
pleasure
.
'
I
*NL*
do
n't
know
what
I
shall
do
for
joy
when
I
see
their
kind
faces
once
*NL*
again
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
short
time
Oliver
was
sufficiently
recovered
to
undergo
the
*NL*
fatigue
of
this
expedition
.
One
morning
he
and
Mr.
Losberne
set
out
,
*NL*
accordingly
,
in
a
little
carriage
which
belonged
to
Mrs.
Maylie
.
When
*NL*
they
came
to
Chertsey
Bridge
,
Oliver
turned
very
pale
,
and
uttered
a
*NL*
loud
exclamation
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
's
the
matter
with
the
boy
?
'
cried
the
doctor
,
as
usual
,
all
in
a
*NL*
bustle
.
`
Do
you
see
anything
--
hear
anything
--
feel
anything
--
eh
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
,
sir
,
'
cried
Oliver
,
pointing
out
of
the
carriage
window
.
`
That
*NL*
house
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
;
well
,
what
of
it
?
Stop
coachman
.
Pull
up
here
,
'
cried
the
*NL*
doctor
.
`
What
of
the
house
,
my
man
;
eh
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
thieves
--
the
house
they
took
me
to
!
'
whispered
Oliver
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
devil
it
is
!
'
cried
the
doctor
.
`
Hallo
,
there
!
let
me
out
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
before
the
coachman
could
dismount
from
his
box
,
he
had
tumbled
*NL*
out
of
the
coach
,
by
some
means
or
other
;
and
,
running
down
to
the
*NL*
deserted
tenement
,
began
kicking
at
the
door
like
a
madman
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Halloa
?
'
said
a
little
ugly
hump-backed
man
:
opening
the
door
so
*NL*
suddenly
,
that
the
doctor
,
from
the
very
impetus
of
his
last
kick
,
*NL*
nearly
fell
forward
into
the
passage
.
`
What
's
the
matter
here
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Matter
!
'
exclaimed
the
other
,
collaring
him
,
without
a
moment
's
*NL*
reflection
.
'
A
good
deal
.
Robbery
is
the
matter
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
There
'll
be
Murder
the
matter
,
too
,
'
replied
the
hump-backed
man
,
*NL*
coolly
,
`
if
you
do
n't
take
your
hands
off
.
Do
you
hear
me
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
hear
you
,
'
said
the
doctor
,
giving
his
captive
a
hearty
shake
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Where
's
--
confound
the
fellow
,
what
's
his
rascally
name
--
Sikes
;
that
's
*NL*
it
.
Where
's
Sikes
,
you
thief
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
hump-backed
man
stared
,
as
if
in
excess
of
amazement
and
*NL*
indignation
;
then
,
twisting
himself
,
dexterously
,
from
the
doctor
's
*NL*
grasp
,
growled
forth
a
volley
of
horrid
oaths
,
and
retired
into
the
*NL*
house
.
Before
he
could
shut
the
door
,
however
,
the
doctor
had
passed
*NL*
into
the
parlour
,
without
a
word
of
parley
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
anxiously
round
;
not
an
article
of
furniture
;
not
a
vestige
*NL*
of
anything
,
animate
or
inanimate
;
not
even
the
position
of
the
*NL*
cupboards
;
answered
Oliver
's
description
!
*NL*
*NL*
`
Now
!
'
said
the
hump-backed
man
,
who
had
watched
him
keenly
,
`
what
do
*NL*
you
mean
by
coming
into
my
house
,
in
this
violent
way
?
Do
you
want
to
*NL*
rob
me
,
or
to
murder
me
?
Which
is
it
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Did
you
ever
know
a
man
come
out
to
do
either
,
in
a
chariot
and
pair
,
*NL*
you
ridiculous
old
vampire
?
'
said
the
irritable
doctor
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
do
you
want
,
then
?
'
demanded
the
hunchback
.
`
Will
you
take
*NL*
yourself
off
,
before
I
do
you
a
mischief
?
Curse
you
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
As
soon
as
I
think
proper
,
'
said
Mr.
Losberne
,
looking
into
the
other
*NL*
parlour
;
which
,
like
the
first
,
bore
no
resemblance
whatever
to
*NL*
Oliver
's
account
of
it
.
'
I
shall
find
you
out
,
some
day
,
my
friend
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Will
you
?
'
sneered
the
ill-favoured
cripple
.
`
If
you
ever
want
me
,
*NL*
I
'm
here
.
I
have
n't
lived
here
mad
and
all
alone
,
for
five-and-twenty
*NL*
years
,
to
be
scared
by
you
.
You
shall
pay
for
this
;
you
shall
pay
for
*NL*
this
.
'
And
so
saying
,
the
mis-shapen
little
demon
set
up
a
yell
,
and
*NL*
danced
upon
the
ground
,
as
if
wild
with
rage
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Stupid
enough
,
this
,
'
muttered
the
doctor
to
himself
;
`
the
boy
must
*NL*
have
made
a
mistake
.
Here
!
Put
that
in
your
pocket
,
and
shut
yourself
*NL*
up
again
.
'
With
these
words
he
flung
the
hunchback
a
piece
of
money
,
*NL*
and
returned
to
the
carriage
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
followed
to
the
chariot
door
,
uttering
the
wildest
imprecations
*NL*
and
curses
all
the
way
;
but
as
Mr.
Losberne
turned
to
speak
to
the
*NL*
driver
,
he
looked
into
the
carriage
,
and
eyed
Oliver
for
an
instant
*NL*
with
a
glance
so
sharp
and
fierce
and
at
the
same
time
so
furious
and
*NL*
vindictive
,
that
,
waking
or
sleeping
,
he
could
not
forget
it
for
months
*NL*
afterwards
.
He
continued
to
utter
the
most
fearful
imprecations
,
until
*NL*
the
driver
had
resumed
his
seat
;
and
when
they
were
once
more
on
their
*NL*
way
,
they
could
see
him
some
distance
behind
:
beating
his
feet
upon
the
*NL*
ground
,
and
tearing
his
hair
,
in
transports
of
real
or
pretended
rage
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
am
an
ass
!
'
said
the
doctor
,
after
a
long
silence
.
`
Did
you
know
*NL*
that
before
,
Oliver
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
sir
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Then
do
n't
forget
it
another
time
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
An
ass
,
'
said
the
doctor
again
,
after
a
further
silence
of
some
*NL*
minutes
.
`
Even
if
it
had
been
the
right
place
,
and
the
right
fellows
*NL*
had
been
there
,
what
could
I
have
done
,
single-handed
?
And
if
I
had
had
*NL*
assistance
,
I
see
no
good
that
I
should
have
done
,
except
leading
to
my
*NL*
own
exposure
,
and
an
unavoidable
statement
of
the
manner
in
which
I
*NL*
have
hushed
up
this
business
.
That
would
have
served
me
right
,
though
.
*NL*
I
am
always
involving
myself
in
some
scrape
or
other
,
by
acting
on
*NL*
impulse
.
It
might
have
done
me
good
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
the
fact
was
that
the
excellent
doctor
had
never
acted
upon
*NL*
anything
but
impulse
all
through
his
life
,
and
it
was
no
bad
compliment
*NL*
to
the
nature
of
the
impulses
which
governed
him
,
that
so
far
from
*NL*
being
involved
in
any
peculiar
troubles
or
misfortunes
,
he
had
the
*NL*
warmest
respect
and
esteem
of
all
who
knew
him
.
If
the
truth
must
be
*NL*
told
,
he
was
a
little
out
of
temper
,
for
a
minute
or
two
,
at
being
*NL*
disappointed
in
procuring
corroborative
evidence
of
Oliver
's
story
on
*NL*
the
very
first
occasion
on
which
he
had
a
chance
of
obtaining
any
.
He
*NL*
soon
came
round
again
,
however
;
and
finding
that
Oliver
's
replies
to
*NL*
his
questions
,
were
still
as
straightforward
and
consistent
,
and
still
*NL*
delivered
with
as
much
apparent
sincerity
and
truth
,
as
they
had
ever
*NL*
been
,
he
made
up
his
mind
to
attach
full
credence
to
them
,
from
that
*NL*
time
forth
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
Oliver
knew
the
name
of
the
street
in
which
Mr.
Brownlow
resided
,
*NL*
they
were
enabled
to
drive
straight
thither
.
When
the
coach
turned
*NL*
into
it
,
his
heart
beat
so
violently
,
that
he
could
scarcely
draw
his
*NL*
breath
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Now
,
my
boy
,
which
house
is
it
?
'
inquired
Mr.
Losberne
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
!
That
!
'
replied
Oliver
,
pointing
eagerly
out
of
the
window
.
*NL*
`
The
white
house
.
Oh
!
make
haste
!
Pray
make
haste
!
I
feel
as
if
I
*NL*
should
die
:
it
makes
me
tremble
so
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Come
,
come
!
'
said
the
good
doctor
,
patting
him
on
the
shoulder
.
`
You
*NL*
will
see
them
directly
,
and
they
will
be
overjoyed
to
find
you
safe
and
*NL*
well
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
!
I
hope
so
!
'
cried
Oliver
.
`
They
were
so
good
to
me
;
so
very
,
*NL*
very
good
to
me
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
coach
rolled
on
.
It
stopped
.
No
;
that
was
the
wrong
house
;
the
*NL*
next
door
.
It
went
on
a
few
paces
,
and
stopped
again
.
Oliver
looked
up
*NL*
at
the
windows
,
with
tears
of
happy
expectation
coursing
down
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alas
!
the
white
house
was
empty
,
and
there
was
a
bill
in
the
window
.
*NL*
`
To
Let
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Knock
at
the
next
door
,
'
cried
Mr.
Losberne
,
taking
Oliver
's
arm
in
*NL*
his
.
`
What
has
become
of
Mr.
Brownlow
,
who
used
to
live
in
the
*NL*
adjoining
house
,
do
you
know
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
servant
did
not
know
;
but
would
go
and
inquire
.
She
presently
*NL*
returned
,
and
said
,
that
Mr.
Brownlow
had
sold
off
his
goods
,
and
gone
*NL*
to
the
West
Indies
,
six
weeks
before
.
Oliver
clasped
his
hands
,
and
*NL*
sank
feebly
backward
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Has
his
housekeeper
gone
too
?
'
inquired
Mr.
Losberne
,
after
a
moment
's
*NL*
pause
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
sir
'
;
replied
the
servant
.
`
The
old
gentleman
,
the
housekeeper
,
*NL*
and
a
gentleman
who
was
a
friend
of
Mr.
Brownlow
's
,
all
went
together
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Then
turn
towards
home
again
,
'
said
Mr.
Losberne
to
the
driver
;
`
and
*NL*
do
n't
stop
to
bait
the
horses
,
till
you
get
out
of
this
confounded
*NL*
London
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
book-stall
keeper
,
sir
?
'
said
Oliver
.
'
I
know
the
way
there
.
See
*NL*
him
,
pray
,
sir
!
Do
see
him
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
My
poor
boy
,
this
is
disappointment
enough
for
one
day
,
'
said
the
*NL*
doctor
.
`
Quite
enough
for
both
of
us
.
If
we
go
to
the
book-stall
*NL*
keeper
's
,
we
shall
certainly
find
that
he
is
dead
,
or
has
set
his
house
*NL*
on
fire
,
or
run
away
.
No
;
home
again
straight
!
'
And
in
obedience
to
*NL*
the
doctor
's
impulse
,
home
they
went
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
bitter
disappointment
caused
Oliver
much
sorrow
and
grief
,
even
in
*NL*
the
midst
of
his
happiness
;
for
he
had
pleased
himself
,
many
times
*NL*
during
his
illness
,
with
thinking
of
all
that
Mr.
Brownlow
and
Mrs.
*NL*
Bedwin
would
say
to
him
:
and
what
delight
it
would
be
to
tell
them
how
*NL*
many
long
days
and
nights
he
had
passed
in
reflecting
on
what
they
had
*NL*
done
for
him
,
and
in
bewailing
his
cruel
separation
from
them
.
The
hope
*NL*
of
eventually
clearing
himself
with
them
,
too
,
and
explaining
how
he
*NL*
had
been
forced
away
,
had
buoyed
him
up
,
and
sustained
him
,
under
many
*NL*
of
his
recent
trials
;
and
now
,
the
idea
that
they
should
have
gone
so
*NL*
far
,
and
carried
with
them
the
belief
that
he
was
an
impostor
and
a
*NL*
robber
--
a
belief
which
might
remain
uncontradicted
to
his
dying
*NL*
day
--
was
almost
more
than
he
could
bear
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
circumstance
occasioned
no
alteration
,
however
,
in
the
behaviour
of
*NL*
his
benefactors
.
After
another
fortnight
,
when
the
fine
warm
weather
*NL*
had
fairly
begun
,
and
every
tree
and
flower
was
putting
forth
its
young
*NL*
leaves
and
rich
blossoms
,
they
made
preparations
for
quitting
the
house
*NL*
at
Chertsey
,
for
some
months
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sending
the
plate
,
which
had
so
excited
Fagin
's
cupidity
,
to
the
*NL*
banker
's
;
and
leaving
Giles
and
another
servant
in
care
of
the
house
,
*NL*
they
departed
to
a
cottage
at
some
distance
in
the
country
,
and
took
*NL*
Oliver
with
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Who
can
describe
the
pleasure
and
delight
,
the
peace
of
mind
and
soft
*NL*
tranquillity
,
the
sickly
boy
felt
in
the
balmy
air
,
and
among
the
green
*NL*
hills
and
rich
woods
,
of
an
inland
village
!
Who
can
tell
how
scenes
of
*NL*
peace
and
quietude
sink
into
the
minds
of
pain-worn
dwellers
in
close
*NL*
and
noisy
places
,
and
carry
their
own
freshness
,
deep
into
their
jaded
*NL*
hearts
!
Men
who
have
lived
in
crowded
,
pent-up
streets
,
through
lives
*NL*
of
toil
,
and
who
have
never
wished
for
change
;
men
,
to
whom
custom
has
*NL*
indeed
been
second
nature
,
and
who
have
come
almost
to
love
each
brick
*NL*
and
stone
that
formed
the
narrow
boundaries
of
their
daily
walks
;
even
*NL*
they
,
with
the
hand
of
death
upon
them
,
have
been
known
to
yearn
at
*NL*
last
for
one
short
glimpse
of
Nature
's
face
;
and
,
carried
far
from
the
*NL*
scenes
of
their
old
pains
and
pleasures
,
have
seemed
to
pass
at
once
*NL*
into
a
new
state
of
being
.
Crawling
forth
,
from
day
to
day
,
to
some
*NL*
green
sunny
spot
,
they
have
had
such
memories
wakened
up
within
them
by
*NL*
the
sight
of
the
sky
,
and
hill
and
plain
,
and
glistening
water
,
that
a
*NL*
foretaste
of
heaven
itself
has
soothed
their
quick
decline
,
and
they
*NL*
have
sunk
into
their
tombs
,
as
peacefully
as
the
sun
whose
setting
they
*NL*
watched
from
their
lonely
chamber
window
but
a
few
hours
before
,
faded
*NL*
from
their
dim
and
feeble
sight
!
The
memories
which
peaceful
country
*NL*
scenes
call
up
,
are
not
of
this
world
,
nor
of
its
thoughts
and
hopes
.
*NL*
Their
gentle
influence
may
teach
us
how
to
weave
fresh
garlands
for
the
*NL*
graves
of
those
we
loved
:
may
purify
our
thoughts
,
and
bear
down
*NL*
before
it
old
enmity
and
hatred
;
but
beneath
all
this
,
there
lingers
,
*NL*
in
the
least
reflective
mind
,
a
vague
and
half-formed
consciousness
of
*NL*
having
held
such
feelings
long
before
,
in
some
remote
and
distant
time
,
*NL*
which
calls
up
solemn
thoughts
of
distant
times
to
come
,
and
bends
down
*NL*
pride
and
worldliness
beneath
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
lovely
spot
to
which
they
repaired
.
Oliver
,
whose
days
had
*NL*
been
spent
among
squalid
crowds
,
and
in
the
midst
of
noise
and
*NL*
brawling
,
seemed
to
enter
on
a
new
existence
there
.
The
rose
and
*NL*
honeysuckle
clung
to
the
cottage
walls
;
the
ivy
crept
round
the
trunks
*NL*
of
the
trees
;
and
the
garden-flowers
perfumed
the
air
with
delicious
*NL*
odours
.
Hard
by
,
was
a
little
churchyard
;
not
crowded
with
tall
*NL*
unsightly
gravestones
,
but
full
of
humble
mounds
,
covered
with
fresh
*NL*
turf
and
moss
:
beneath
which
,
the
old
people
of
the
village
lay
at
*NL*
rest
.
Oliver
often
wandered
here
;
and
,
thinking
of
the
wretched
grave
*NL*
in
which
his
mother
lay
,
would
sometimes
sit
him
down
and
sob
unseen
;
*NL*
but
,
when
he
raised
his
eyes
to
the
deep
sky
overhead
,
he
would
cease
*NL*
to
think
of
her
as
lying
in
the
ground
,
and
would
weep
for
her
,
sadly
,
*NL*
but
without
pain
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
happy
time
.
The
days
were
peaceful
and
serene
;
the
nights
*NL*
brought
with
them
neither
fear
nor
care
;
no
languishing
in
a
wretched
*NL*
prison
,
or
associating
with
wretched
men
;
nothing
but
pleasant
and
*NL*
happy
thoughts
.
Every
morning
he
went
to
a
white-headed
old
gentleman
,
*NL*
who
lived
near
the
little
church
:
who
taught
him
to
read
better
,
and
to
*NL*
write
:
and
who
spoke
so
kindly
,
and
took
such
pains
,
that
Oliver
could
*NL*
never
try
enough
to
please
him
.
Then
,
he
would
walk
with
Mrs.
Maylie
*NL*
and
Rose
,
and
hear
them
talk
of
books
;
or
perhaps
sit
near
them
,
in
*NL*
some
shady
place
,
and
listen
whilst
the
young
lady
read
:
which
he
could
*NL*
have
done
,
until
it
grew
too
dark
to
see
the
letters
.
Then
,
he
had
his
*NL*
own
lesson
for
the
next
day
to
prepare
;
and
at
this
,
he
would
work
*NL*
hard
,
in
a
little
room
which
looked
into
the
garden
,
till
evening
came
*NL*
slowly
on
,
when
the
ladies
would
walk
out
again
,
and
he
with
them
:
*NL*
listening
with
such
pleasure
to
all
they
said
:
and
so
happy
if
they
*NL*
wanted
a
flower
that
he
could
climb
to
reach
,
or
had
forgotten
anything
*NL*
he
could
run
to
fetch
:
that
he
could
never
be
quick
enough
about
it
.
*NL*
When
it
became
quite
dark
,
and
they
returned
home
,
the
young
lady
would
*NL*
sit
down
to
the
piano
,
and
play
some
pleasant
air
,
or
sing
,
in
a
low
*NL*
and
gentle
voice
,
some
old
song
which
it
pleased
her
aunt
to
hear
.
*NL*
There
would
be
no
candles
lighted
at
such
times
as
these
;
and
Oliver
*NL*
would
sit
by
one
of
the
windows
,
listening
to
the
sweet
music
,
in
a
*NL*
perfect
rapture
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
when
Sunday
came
,
how
differently
the
day
was
spent
,
from
any
way
*NL*
in
which
he
had
ever
spent
it
yet
!
and
how
happily
too
;
like
all
the
*NL*
other
days
in
that
most
happy
time
!
There
was
the
little
church
,
in
*NL*
the
morning
,
with
the
green
leaves
fluttering
at
the
windows
:
the
*NL*
birds
singing
without
:
and
the
sweet-smelling
air
stealing
in
at
the
*NL*
low
porch
,
and
filling
the
homely
building
with
its
fragrance
.
The
poor
*NL*
people
were
so
neat
and
clean
,
and
knelt
so
reverently
in
prayer
,
that
*NL*
it
seemed
a
pleasure
,
not
a
tedious
duty
,
their
assembling
there
*NL*
together
;
and
though
the
singing
might
be
rude
,
it
was
real
,
and
*NL*
sounded
more
musical
-LRB-
to
Oliver
's
ears
at
least
-RRB-
than
any
he
had
ever
*NL*
heard
in
church
before
.
Then
,
there
were
the
walks
as
usual
,
and
many
*NL*
calls
at
the
clean
houses
of
the
labouring
men
;
and
at
night
,
Oliver
*NL*
read
a
chapter
or
two
from
the
Bible
,
which
he
had
been
studying
all
*NL*
the
week
,
and
in
the
performance
of
which
duty
he
felt
more
proud
and
*NL*
pleased
,
than
if
he
had
been
the
clergyman
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
morning
,
Oliver
would
be
a-foot
by
six
o'clock
,
roaming
the
*NL*
fields
,
and
plundering
the
hedges
,
far
and
wide
,
for
nosegays
of
wild
*NL*
flowers
,
with
which
he
would
return
laden
,
home
;
and
which
it
took
*NL*
great
care
and
consideration
to
arrange
,
to
the
best
advantage
,
for
the
*NL*
embellishment
of
the
breakfast-table
.
There
was
fresh
groundsel
,
too
,
*NL*
for
Miss
Maylie
's
birds
,
with
which
Oliver
,
who
had
been
studying
the
*NL*
subject
under
the
able
tuition
of
the
village
clerk
,
would
decorate
the
*NL*
cages
,
in
the
most
approved
taste
.
When
the
birds
were
made
all
spruce
*NL*
and
smart
for
the
day
,
there
was
usually
some
little
commission
of
*NL*
charity
to
execute
in
the
village
;
or
,
failing
that
,
there
was
rare
*NL*
cricket-playing
,
sometimes
,
on
the
green
;
or
,
failing
that
,
there
was
*NL*
always
something
to
do
in
the
garden
,
or
about
the
plants
,
to
which
*NL*
Oliver
-LRB-
who
had
studied
this
science
also
,
under
the
same
master
,
who
*NL*
was
a
gardener
by
trade
,
-RRB-
applied
himself
with
hearty
good-will
,
until
*NL*
Miss
Rose
made
her
appearance
:
when
there
were
a
thousand
*NL*
commendations
to
be
bestowed
on
all
he
had
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
three
months
glided
away
;
three
months
which
,
in
the
life
of
the
*NL*
most
blessed
and
favoured
of
mortals
,
might
have
been
unmingled
*NL*
happiness
,
and
which
,
in
Oliver
's
were
true
felicity
.
With
the
purest
*NL*
and
most
amiable
generosity
on
one
side
;
and
the
truest
,
warmest
,
*NL*
soul-felt
gratitude
on
the
other
;
it
is
no
wonder
that
,
by
the
end
of
*NL*
that
short
time
,
Oliver
Twist
had
become
completely
domesticated
with
*NL*
the
old
lady
and
her
niece
,
and
that
the
fervent
attachment
of
his
*NL*
young
and
sensitive
heart
,
was
repaid
by
their
pride
in
,

CHAPTER
XXXIII
*NL*
*NL*
WHEREIN
THE
HAPPINESS
OF
OLIVER
AND
HIS
FRIENDS
,
EXPERIENCES
A
SUDDEN
*NL*
CHECK
*NL*
*NL*
Spring
flew
swiftly
by
,
and
summer
came
.
If
the
village
had
been
*NL*
beautiful
at
first
it
was
now
in
the
full
glow
and
luxuriance
of
its
*NL*
richness
.
The
great
trees
,
which
had
looked
shrunken
and
bare
in
the
*NL*
earlier
months
,
had
now
burst
into
strong
life
and
health
;
and
*NL*
stretching
forth
their
green
arms
over
the
thirsty
ground
,
converted
*NL*
open
and
naked
spots
into
choice
nooks
,
where
was
a
deep
and
pleasant
*NL*
shade
from
which
to
look
upon
the
wide
prospect
,
steeped
in
sunshine
,
*NL*
which
lay
stretched
beyond
.
The
earth
had
donned
her
mantle
of
*NL*
brightest
green
;
and
shed
her
richest
perfumes
abroad
.
It
was
the
*NL*
prime
and
vigour
of
the
year
;
all
things
were
glad
and
flourishing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Still
,
the
same
quiet
life
went
on
at
the
little
cottage
,
and
the
same
*NL*
cheerful
serenity
prevailed
among
its
inmates
.
Oliver
had
long
since
*NL*
grown
stout
and
healthy
;
but
health
or
sickness
made
no
difference
in
*NL*
his
warm
feelings
of
a
great
many
people
.
He
was
still
the
same
*NL*
gentle
,
attached
,
affectionate
creature
that
he
had
been
when
pain
and
*NL*
suffering
had
wasted
his
strength
,
and
when
he
was
dependent
for
every
*NL*
slight
attention
,
and
comfort
on
those
who
tended
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
beautiful
night
,
when
they
had
taken
a
longer
walk
than
was
*NL*
customary
with
them
:
for
the
day
had
been
unusually
warm
,
and
there
*NL*
was
a
brilliant
moon
,
and
a
light
wind
had
sprung
up
,
which
was
*NL*
unusually
refreshing
.
Rose
had
been
in
high
spirits
,
too
,
and
they
had
*NL*
walked
on
,
in
merry
conversation
,
until
they
had
far
exceeded
their
*NL*
ordinary
bounds
.
Mrs.
Maylie
being
fatigued
,
they
returned
more
slowly
*NL*
home
.
The
young
lady
merely
throwing
off
her
simple
bonnet
,
sat
down
*NL*
to
the
piano
as
usual
.
After
running
abstractedly
over
the
keys
for
a
*NL*
few
minutes
,
she
fell
into
a
low
and
very
solemn
air
;
and
as
she
played
*NL*
it
,
they
heard
a
sound
as
if
she
were
weeping
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Rose
,
my
dear
!
'
said
the
elder
lady
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rose
made
no
reply
,
but
played
a
little
quicker
,
as
though
the
words
*NL*
had
roused
her
from
some
painful
thoughts
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Rose
,
my
love
!
'
cried
Mrs.
Maylie
,
rising
hastily
,
and
bending
over
*NL*
her
.
`
What
is
this
?
In
tears
!
My
dear
child
,
what
distresses
you
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Nothing
,
aunt
;
nothing
,
'
replied
the
young
lady
.
'
I
do
n't
know
what
*NL*
it
is
;
I
ca
n't
describe
it
;
but
I
feel
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Not
ill
,
my
love
?
'
interposed
Mrs.
Maylie
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
no
!
Oh
,
not
ill
!
'
replied
Rose
:
shuddering
as
though
some
deadly
*NL*
chillness
were
passing
over
her
,
while
she
spoke
;
'
I
shall
be
better
*NL*
presently
.
Close
the
window
,
pray
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Oliver
hastened
to
comply
with
her
request
.
The
young
lady
,
making
an
*NL*
effort
to
recover
her
cheerfulness
,
strove
to
play
some
livelier
tune
;
*NL*
but
her
fingers
dropped
powerless
over
the
keys
.
Covering
her
face
with
*NL*
her
hands
,
she
sank
upon
a
sofa
,
and
gave
vent
to
the
tears
which
she
*NL*
was
now
unable
to
repress
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
My
child
!
'
said
the
elderly
lady
,
folding
her
arms
about
her
,
'
I
never
*NL*
saw
you
so
before
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
would
not
alarm
you
if
I
could
avoid
it
,
'
rejoined
Rose
;
`
but
indeed
*NL*
I
have
tried
very
hard
,
and
can
not
help
this
.
I
fear
I
_
am
_
ill
,
aunt
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
,
indeed
;
for
,
when
candles
were
brought
,
they
saw
that
in
the
*NL*
very
short
time
which
had
elapsed
since
their
return
home
,
the
hue
of
*NL*
her
countenance
had
changed
to
a
marble
whiteness
.
Its
expression
had
*NL*
lost
nothing
of
its
beauty
;
but
it
was
changed
;
and
there
was
an
*NL*
anxious
haggard
look
about
the
gentle
face
,
which
it
had
never
worn
*NL*
before
.
Another
minute
,
and
it
was
suffused
with
a
crimson
flush
:
and
*NL*
a
heavy
wildness
came
over
the
soft
blue
eye
.
Again
this
disappeared
,
*NL*
like
the
shadow
thrown
by
a
passing
cloud
;
and
she
was
once
more
deadly
*NL*
pale
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oliver
,
who
watched
the
old
lady
anxiously
,
observed
that
she
was
*NL*
alarmed
by
these
appearances
;
and
so
in
truth
,
was
he
;
but
seeing
that
*NL*
she
affected
to
make
light
of
them
,
he
endeavoured
to
do
the
same
,
and
*NL*
they
so
far
succeeded
,
that
when
Rose
was
persuaded
by
her
aunt
to
*NL*
retire
for
the
night
,
she
was
in
better
spirits
;
and
appeared
even
in
*NL*
better
health
:
assuring
them
that
she
felt
certain
she
should
rise
in
*NL*
the
morning
,
quite
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
hope
,
'
said
Oliver
,
when
Mrs.
Maylie
returned
,
`
that
nothing
is
the
*NL*
matter
?
She
do
n't
look
well
to-night
,
but
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
lady
motioned
to
him
not
to
speak
;
and
sitting
herself
down
in
*NL*
a
dark
corner
of
the
room
,
remained
silent
for
some
time
.
At
length
,
*NL*
she
said
,
in
a
trembling
voice
:
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
hope
not
,
Oliver
.
I
have
been
very
happy
with
her
for
some
years
:
*NL*
too
happy
,
perhaps
.
It
may
be
time
that
I
should
meet
with
some
*NL*
misfortune
;
but
I
hope
it
is
not
this
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
?
'
inquired
Oliver
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
heavy
blow
,
'
said
the
old
lady
,
`
of
losing
the
dear
girl
who
has
*NL*
so
long
been
my
comfort
and
happiness
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
!
God
forbid
!
'
exclaimed
Oliver
,
hastily
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Amen
to
that
,
my
child
!
'
said
the
old
lady
,
wringing
her
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Surely
there
is
no
danger
of
anything
so
dreadful
?
'
said
Oliver
.
`
Two
*NL*
hours
ago
,
she
was
quite
well
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
She
is
very
ill
now
,
'
rejoined
Mrs.
Maylies
;
`
and
will
be
worse
,
I
am
*NL*
sure
.
My
dear
,
dear
Rose
!
Oh
,
what
shall
I
do
without
her
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
gave
way
to
such
great
grief
,
that
Oliver
,
suppressing
his
own
*NL*
emotion
,
ventured
to
remonstrate
with
her
;
and
to
beg
,
earnestly
,
that
,
*NL*
for
the
sake
of
the
dear
young
lady
herself
,
she
would
be
more
calm
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
consider
,
ma'am
,
'
said
Oliver
,
as
the
tears
forced
themselves
into
*NL*
his
eyes
,
despite
of
his
efforts
to
the
contrary
.
`
Oh
!
consider
how
*NL*
young
and
good
she
is
,
and
what
pleasure
and
comfort
she
gives
to
all
*NL*
about
her
.
I
am
sure
--
certain
--
quite
certain
--
that
,
for
your
sake
,
who
*NL*
are
so
good
yourself
;
and
for
her
own
;
and
for
the
sake
of
all
she
*NL*
makes
so
happy
;
she
will
not
die
.
Heaven
will
never
let
her
die
so
*NL*
young
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Hush
!
'
said
Mrs.
Maylie
,
laying
her
hand
on
Oliver
's
head
.
`
You
think
*NL*
like
a
child
,
poor
boy
.
But
you
teach
me
my
duty
,
notwithstanding
.
I
*NL*
had
forgotten
it
for
a
moment
,
Oliver
,
but
I
hope
I
may
be
pardoned
,
*NL*
for
I
am
old
,
and
have
seen
enough
of
illness
and
death
to
know
the
*NL*
agony
of
separation
from
the
objects
of
our
love
.
I
have
seen
enough
,
*NL*
too
,
to
know
that
it
is
not
always
the
youngest
and
best
who
are
spared
*NL*
to
those
that
love
them
;
but
this
should
give
us
comfort
in
our
sorrow
;
*NL*
for
Heaven
is
just
;
and
such
things
teach
us
,
impressively
,
that
there
*NL*
is
a
brighter
world
than
this
;
and
that
the
passage
to
it
is
speedy
.
*NL*
God
's
will
be
done
!
I
love
her
;
and
He
knows
how
well
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Oliver
was
surprised
to
see
that
as
Mrs.
Maylie
said
these
words
,
she
*NL*
checked
her
lamentations
as
though
by
one
effort
;
and
drawing
herself
*NL*
up
as
she
spoke
,
became
composed
and
firm
.
He
was
still
more
*NL*
astonished
to
find
that
this
firmness
lasted
;
and
that
,
under
all
the
*NL*
care
and
watching
which
ensued
,
Mrs.
Maylie
was
ever
ready
and
*NL*
collected
:
performing
all
the
duties
which
had
devolved
upon
her
,
*NL*
steadily
,
and
,
to
all
external
appearances
,
even
cheerfully
.
But
he
*NL*
was
young
,
and
did
not
know
what
strong
minds
are
capable
of
,
under
*NL*
trying
circumstances
.
How
should
he
,
when
their
possessors
so
seldom
*NL*
know
themselves
?
*NL*
*NL*
An
anxious
night
ensued
.
When
morning
came
,
Mrs.
Maylie
's
predictions
*NL*
were
but
too
well
verified
.
Rose
was
in
the
first
stage
of
a
high
and
*NL*
dangerous
fever
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
We
must
be
active
,
Oliver
,
and
not
give
way
to
useless
grief
,
'
said
*NL*
Mrs.
Maylie
,
laying
her
finger
on
her
lip
,
as
she
looked
steadily
into
*NL*
his
face
;
`
this
letter
must
be
sent
,
with
all
possible
expedition
,
to
*NL*
Mr.
Losberne
.
It
must
be
carried
to
the
market-town
:
which
is
not
more
*NL*
than
four
miles
off
,
by
the
footpath
across
the
field
:
and
thence
*NL*
dispatched
,
by
an
express
on
horseback
,
straight
to
Chertsey
.
The
*NL*
people
at
the
inn
will
undertake
to
do
this
:
and
I
can
trust
to
you
to
*NL*
see
it
done
,
I
know
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Oliver
could
make
no
reply
,
but
looked
his
anxiety
to
be
gone
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Here
is
another
letter
,
'
said
Mrs.
Maylie
,
pausing
to
reflect
;
`
but
*NL*
whether
to
send
it
now
,
or
wait
until
I
see
how
Rose
goes
on
,
I
*NL*
scarcely
know
.
I
would
not
forward
it
,
unless
I
feared
the
worst
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Is
it
for
Chertsey
,
too
,
ma'am
?
'
inquired
Oliver
;
impatient
to
execute
*NL*
his
commission
,
and
holding
out
his
trembling
hand
for
the
letter
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
'
replied
the
old
lady
,
giving
it
to
him
mechanically
.
Oliver
*NL*
glanced
at
it
,
and
saw
that
it
was
directed
to
Harry
Maylie
,
Esquire
,
*NL*
at
some
great
lord
's
house
in
the
country
;
where
,
he
could
not
make
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Shall
it
go
,
ma'am
?
'
asked
Oliver
,
looking
up
,
impatiently
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
think
not
,
'
replied
Mrs.
Maylie
,
taking
it
back
.
'
I
will
wait
until
*NL*
to-morrow
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
With
these
words
,
she
gave
Oliver
her
purse
,
and
he
started
off
,
*NL*
without
more
delay
,
at
the
greatest
speed
he
could
muster
.
*NL*
*NL*
Swiftly
he
ran
across
the
fields
,
and
down
the
little
lanes
which
*NL*
sometimes
divided
them
:
now
almost
hidden
by
the
high
corn
on
either
*NL*
side
,
and
now
emerging
on
an
open
field
,
where
the
mowers
and
haymakers
*NL*
were
busy
at
their
work
:
nor
did
he
stop
once
,
save
now
and
then
,
for
*NL*
a
few
seconds
,
to
recover
breath
,
until
he
came
,
in
a
great
heat
,
and
*NL*
covered
with
dust
,
on
the
little
market-place
of
the
market-town
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
he
paused
,
and
looked
about
for
the
inn
.
There
were
a
white
bank
,
*NL*
and
a
red
brewery
,
and
a
yellow
town-hall
;
and
in
one
corner
there
was
*NL*
a
large
house
,
with
all
the
wood
about
it
painted
green
:
before
which
*NL*
was
the
sign
of
`
The
George
.
'
To
this
he
hastened
,
as
soon
as
it
*NL*
caught
his
eye
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
spoke
to
a
postboy
who
was
dozing
under
the
gateway
;
and
who
,
after
*NL*
hearing
what
he
wanted
,
referred
him
to
the
ostler
;
who
after
hearing
*NL*
all
he
had
to
say
again
,
referred
him
to
the
landlord
;
who
was
a
tall
*NL*
gentleman
in
a
blue
neckcloth
,
a
white
hat
,
drab
breeches
,
and
boots
*NL*
with
tops
to
match
,
leaning
against
a
pump
by
the
stable-door
,
picking
*NL*
his
teeth
with
a
silver
toothpick
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
gentleman
walked
with
much
deliberation
into
the
bar
to
make
out
*NL*
the
bill
:
which
took
a
long
time
making
out
:
and
after
it
was
ready
,
*NL*
and
paid
,
a
horse
had
to
be
saddled
,
and
a
man
to
be
dressed
,
which
*NL*
took
up
ten
good
minutes
more
.
Meanwhile
Oliver
was
in
such
a
*NL*
desperate
state
of
impatience
and
anxiety
,
that
he
felt
as
if
he
could
*NL*
have
jumped
upon
the
horse
himself
,
and
galloped
away
,
full
tear
,
to
*NL*
the
next
stage
.
At
length
,
all
was
ready
;
and
the
little
parcel
having
*NL*
been
handed
up
,
with
many
injunctions
and
entreaties
for
its
speedy
*NL*
delivery
,
the
man
set
spurs
to
his
horse
,
and
rattling
over
the
uneven
*NL*
paving
of
the
market-place
,
was
out
of
the
town
,
and
galloping
along
*NL*
the
turnpike-road
,
in
a
couple
of
minutes
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
it
was
something
to
feel
certain
that
assistance
was
sent
for
,
and
*NL*
that
no
time
had
been
lost
,
Oliver
hurried
up
the
inn-yard
,
with
a
*NL*
somewhat
lighter
heart
.
He
was
turning
out
of
the
gateway
when
he
*NL*
accidently
stumbled
against
a
tall
man
wrapped
in
a
cloak
,
who
was
at
*NL*
that
moment
coming
out
of
the
inn
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Hah
!
'
cried
the
man
,
fixing
his
eyes
on
Oliver
,
and
suddenly
*NL*
recoiling
.
`
What
the
devil
's
this
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
beg
your
pardon
,
sir
,
'
said
Oliver
;
'
I
was
in
a
great
hurry
to
get
*NL*
home
,
and
did
n't
see
you
were
coming
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Death
!
'
muttered
the
man
to
himself
,
glaring
at
the
boy
with
his
large
*NL*
dark
eyes
.
`
Who
would
have
thought
it
!
Grind
him
to
ashes
!
He
'd
start
*NL*
up
from
a
stone
coffin
,
to
come
in
my
way
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
am
sorry
,
'
stammered
Oliver
,
confused
by
the
strange
man
's
wild
*NL*
look
.
'
I
hope
I
have
not
hurt
you
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Rot
you
!
'
murmured
the
man
,
in
a
horrible
passion
;
between
his
*NL*
clenched
teeth
;
`
if
I
had
only
had
the
courage
to
say
the
word
,
I
might
*NL*
have
been
free
of
you
in
a
night
.
Curses
on
your
head
,
and
black
death
*NL*
on
your
heart
,
you
imp
!
What
are
you
doing
here
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
shook
his
fist
,
as
he
uttered
these
words
incoherently
.
He
*NL*
advanced
towards
Oliver
,
as
if
with
the
intention
of
aiming
a
blow
at
*NL*
him
,
but
fell
violently
on
the
ground
:
writhing
and
foaming
,
in
a
fit
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oliver
gazed
,
for
a
moment
,
at
the
struggles
of
the
madman
-LRB-
for
such
he
*NL*
supposed
him
to
be
-RRB-
;
and
then
darted
into
the
house
for
help
.
Having
*NL*
seen
him
safely
carried
into
the
hotel
,
he
turned
his
face
homewards
,
*NL*
running
as
fast
as
he
could
,
to
make
up
for
lost
time
:
and
recalling
*NL*
with
a
great
deal
of
astonishment
and
some
fear
,
the
extraordinary
*NL*
behaviour
of
the
person
from
whom
he
had
just
parted
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
circumstance
did
not
dwell
in
his
recollection
long
,
however
:
for
*NL*
when
he
reached
the
cottage
,
there
was
enough
to
occupy
his
mind
,
and
*NL*
to
drive
all
considerations
of
self
completely
from
his
memory
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rose
Maylie
had
rapidly
grown
worse
;
before
mid-night
she
was
*NL*
delirious
.
A
medical
practitioner
,
who
resided
on
the
spot
,
was
in
*NL*
constant
attendance
upon
her
;
and
after
first
seeing
the
patient
,
he
*NL*
had
taken
Mrs.
Maylie
aside
,
and
pronounced
her
disorder
to
be
one
of
a
*NL*
most
alarming
nature
.
`
In
fact
,
'
he
said
,
`
it
would
be
little
short
of
*NL*
a
miracle
,
if
she
recovered
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
How
often
did
Oliver
start
from
his
bed
that
night
,
and
stealing
out
,
*NL*
with
noiseless
footstep
,
to
the
staircase
,
listen
for
the
slightest
*NL*
sound
from
the
sick
chamber
!
How
often
did
a
tremble
shake
his
frame
,
*NL*
and
cold
drops
of
terror
start
upon
his
brow
,
when
a
sudden
trampling
*NL*
of
feet
caused
him
to
fear
that
something
too
dreadful
to
think
of
,
had
*NL*
even
then
occurred
!
And
what
had
been
the
fervency
of
all
the
prayers
*NL*
he
had
ever
muttered
,
compared
with
those
he
poured
forth
,
now
,
in
the
*NL*
agony
and
passion
of
his
supplication
for
the
life
and
health
of
the
*NL*
gentle
creature
,
who
was
tottering
on
the
deep
grave
's
verge
!
*NL*
*NL*
Oh
!
the
suspense
,
the
fearful
,
acute
suspense
,
of
standing
idly
by
*NL*
while
the
life
of
one
we
dearly
love
,
is
trembling
in
the
balance
!
Oh
!
*NL*
the
racking
thoughts
that
crowd
upon
the
mind
,
and
make
the
heart
beat
*NL*
violently
,
and
the
breath
come
thick
,
by
the
force
of
the
images
they
*NL*
conjure
up
before
it
;
the
desperate
anxiety
_
to
be
doing
something
_
to
*NL*
relieve
the
pain
,
or
lessen
the
danger
,
which
we
have
no
power
to
*NL*
alleviate
;
the
sinking
of
soul
and
spirit
,
which
the
sad
remembrance
of
*NL*
our
helplessness
produces
;
what
tortures
can
equal
these
;
what
*NL*
reflections
or
endeavours
can
,
in
the
full
tide
and
fever
of
the
time
,
*NL*
allay
them
!
*NL*
*NL*
Morning
came
;
and
the
little
cottage
was
lonely
and
still
.
People
spoke
*NL*
in
whispers
;
anxious
faces
appeared
at
the
gate
,
from
time
to
time
;
*NL*
women
and
children
went
away
in
tears
.
All
the
livelong
day
,
and
for
*NL*
hours
after
it
had
grown
dark
,
Oliver
paced
softly
up
and
down
the
*NL*
garden
,
raising
his
eyes
every
instant
to
the
sick
chamber
,
and
*NL*
shuddering
to
see
the
darkened
window
,
looking
as
if
death
lay
*NL*
stretched
inside
.
Late
that
night
,
Mr.
Losberne
arrived
.
`
It
is
*NL*
hard
,
'
said
the
good
doctor
,
turning
away
as
he
spoke
;
`
so
young
;
so
*NL*
much
beloved
;
but
there
is
very
little
hope
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Another
morning
.
The
sun
shone
brightly
;
as
brightly
as
if
it
looked
*NL*
upon
no
misery
or
care
;
and
,
with
every
leaf
and
flower
in
full
bloom
*NL*
about
her
;
with
life
,
and
health
,
and
sounds
and
sights
of
joy
,
*NL*
surrounding
her
on
every
side
:
the
fair
young
creature
lay
,
wasting
*NL*
fast
.
Oliver
crept
away
to
the
old
churchyard
,
and
sitting
down
on
one
*NL*
of
the
green
mounds
,
wept
and
prayed
for
her
,
in
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
such
peace
and
beauty
in
the
scene
;
so
much
of
brightness
and
*NL*
mirth
in
the
sunny
landscape
;
such
blithesome
music
in
the
songs
of
the
*NL*
summer
birds
;
such
freedom
in
the
rapid
flight
of
the
rook
,
careering
*NL*
overhead
;
so
much
of
life
and
joyousness
in
all
;
that
,
when
the
boy
*NL*
raised
his
aching
eyes
,
and
looked
about
,
the
thought
instinctively
*NL*
occurred
to
him
,
that
this
was
not
a
time
for
death
;
that
Rose
could
*NL*
surely
never
die
when
humbler
things
were
all
so
glad
and
gay
;
that
*NL*
graves
were
for
cold
and
cheerless
winter
:
not
for
sunlight
and
*NL*
fragrance
.
He
almost
thought
that
shrouds
were
for
the
old
and
*NL*
shrunken
;
and
that
they
never
wrapped
the
young
and
graceful
form
in
*NL*
their
ghastly
folds
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
knell
from
the
church
bell
broke
harshly
on
these
youthful
thoughts
.
*NL*
Another
!
Again
!
It
was
tolling
for
the
funeral
service
.
A
group
of
*NL*
humble
mourners
entered
the
gate
:
wearing
white
favours
;
for
the
corpse
*NL*
was
young
.
They
stood
uncovered
by
a
grave
;
and
there
was
a
mother
--
a
*NL*
mother
once
--
among
the
weeping
train
.
But
the
sun
shone
brightly
,
and
*NL*
the
birds
sang
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oliver
turned
homeward
,
thinking
on
the
many
kindnesses
he
had
received
*NL*
from
the
young
lady
,
and
wishing
that
the
time
could
come
again
,
that
*NL*
he
might
never
cease
showing
her
how
grateful
and
attached
he
was
.
He
*NL*
had
no
cause
for
self-reproach
on
the
score
of
neglect
,
or
want
of
*NL*
thought
,
for
he
had
been
devoted
to
her
service
;
and
yet
a
hundred
*NL*
little
occasions
rose
up
before
him
,
on
which
he
fancied
he
might
have
*NL*
been
more
zealous
,
and
more
earnest
,
and
wished
he
had
been
.
We
need
*NL*
be
careful
how
we
deal
with
those
about
us
,
when
every
death
carries
to
*NL*
some
small
circle
of
survivors
,
thoughts
of
so
much
omitted
,
and
so
*NL*
little
done
--
of
so
many
things
forgotten
,
and
so
many
more
which
might
*NL*
have
been
repaired
!
There
is
no
remorse
so
deep
as
that
which
is
*NL*
unavailing
;
if
we
would
be
spared
its
tortures
,
let
us
remember
this
,
*NL*
in
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
reached
home
Mrs.
Maylie
was
sitting
in
the
little
parlour
.
*NL*
Oliver
's
heart
sank
at
sight
of
her
;
for
she
had
never
left
the
bedside
*NL*
of
her
niece
;
and
he
trembled
to
think
what
change
could
have
driven
*NL*
her
away
.
He
learnt
that
she
had
fallen
into
a
deep
sleep
,
from
which
*NL*
she
would
waken
,
either
to
recovery
and
life
,
or
to
bid
them
farewell
,
*NL*
and
die
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
sat
,
listening
,
and
afraid
to
speak
,
for
hours
.
The
untasted
meal
*NL*
was
removed
,
with
looks
which
showed
that
their
thoughts
were
*NL*
elsewhere
,
they
watched
the
sun
as
he
sank
lower
and
lower
,
and
,
at
*NL*
length
,
cast
over
sky
and
earth
those
brilliant
hues
which
herald
his
*NL*
departure
.
Their
quick
ears
caught
the
sound
of
an
approaching
*NL*
footstep
.
They
both
involuntarily
darted
to
the
door
,
as
Mr.
Losberne
*NL*
entered
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
of
Rose
?
'
cried
the
old
lady
.
`
Tell
me
at
once
!
I
can
bear
it
;
*NL*
anything
but
suspense
!
Oh
,
tell
me
!
in
the
name
of
Heaven
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
must
compose
yourself
,
'
said
the
doctor
supporting
her
.
`
Be
calm
,
*NL*
my
dear
ma'am
,
pray
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Let
me
go
,
in
God
's
name
!
My
dear
child
!
She
is
dead
!
She
is
dying
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
!
'
cried
the
doctor
,
passionately
.
`
As
He
is
good
and
merciful
,
she
*NL*
will
live
to
bless
us
all
,
for
years
to
come
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
lady
fell
upon
her
knees
,
and
tried
to
fold
her
hands
together
;
but
*NL*
the
energy
which
had
supported
her
so
long
,
fled
up
to
Heaven
with
her
*NL*
first
thanksgiving
;
and
she
sank
into
the
friendly
arms
which
were
*NL*
extended
to
receive
her
.

CHAPTER
XXXIV
*NL*
*NL*
CONTAINS
SOME
INTRODUCTORY
PARTICULARS
RELATIVE
TO
A
YOUNG
GENTLEMAN
*NL*
WHO
NOW
ARRIVES
UPON
THE
SCENE
;
AND
A
NEW
ADVENTURE
WHICH
HAPPENED
TO
*NL*
OLIVER
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
almost
too
much
happiness
to
bear
.
Oliver
felt
stunned
and
*NL*
stupefied
by
the
unexpected
intelligence
;
he
could
not
weep
,
or
speak
,
*NL*
or
rest
.
He
had
scarcely
the
power
of
understanding
anything
that
had
*NL*
passed
,
until
,
after
a
long
ramble
in
the
quiet
evening
air
,
a
burst
of
*NL*
tears
came
to
his
relief
,
and
he
seemed
to
awaken
,
all
at
once
,
to
a
*NL*
full
sense
of
the
joyful
change
that
had
occurred
,
and
the
almost
*NL*
insupportable
load
of
anguish
which
had
been
taken
from
his
breast
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
night
was
fast
closing
in
,
when
he
returned
homeward
:
laden
with
*NL*
flowers
which
he
had
culled
,
with
peculiar
care
,
for
the
adornment
of
*NL*
the
sick
chamber
.
As
he
walked
briskly
along
the
road
,
he
heard
behind
*NL*
him
,
the
noise
of
some
vehicle
,
approaching
at
a
furious
pace
.
Looking
*NL*
round
,
he
saw
that
it
was
a
post-chaise
,
driven
at
great
speed
;
and
as
*NL*
the
horses
were
galloping
,
and
the
road
was
narrow
,
he
stood
leaning
*NL*
against
a
gate
until
it
should
have
passed
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
it
dashed
on
,
Oliver
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
man
in
a
white
nightcap
,
*NL*
whose
face
seemed
familiar
to
him
,
although
his
view
was
so
brief
that
*NL*
he
could
not
identify
the
person
.
In
another
second
or
two
,
the
*NL*
nightcap
was
thrust
out
of
the
chaise-window
,
and
a
stentorian
voice
*NL*
bellowed
to
the
driver
to
stop
:
which
he
did
,
as
soon
as
he
could
pull
*NL*
up
his
horses
.
Then
,
the
nightcap
once
again
appeared
:
and
the
same
*NL*
voice
called
Oliver
by
his
name
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Here
!
'
cried
the
voice
.
`
Oliver
,
what
's
the
news
?
Miss
Rose
!
Master
*NL*
O-li-ver
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Is
is
you
,
Giles
?
'
cried
Oliver
,
running
up
to
the
chaise-door
.
*NL*
*NL*
Giles
popped
out
his
nightcap
again
,
preparatory
to
making
some
reply
,
*NL*
when
he
was
suddenly
pulled
back
by
a
young
gentleman
who
occupied
the
*NL*
other
corner
of
the
chaise
,
and
who
eagerly
demanded
what
was
the
news
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
In
a
word
!
'
cried
the
gentleman
,
`
Better
or
worse
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Better
--
much
better
!
'
replied
Oliver
,
hastily
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Thank
Heaven
!
'
exclaimed
the
gentleman
.
`
You
are
sure
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Quite
,
sir
,
'
replied
Oliver
.
`
The
change
took
place
only
a
few
hours
*NL*
ago
;
and
Mr.
Losberne
says
,
that
all
danger
is
at
an
end
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
gentleman
said
not
another
word
,
but
,
opening
the
chaise-door
,
*NL*
leaped
out
,
and
taking
Oliver
hurriedly
by
the
arm
,
led
him
aside
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
are
quite
certain
?
There
is
no
possibility
of
any
mistake
on
your
*NL*
part
,
my
boy
,
is
there
?
'
demanded
the
gentleman
in
a
tremulous
voice
.
*NL*
`
Do
not
deceive
me
,
by
awakening
hopes
that
are
not
to
be
fulfilled
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
would
not
for
the
world
,
sir
,
'
replied
Oliver
.
`
Indeed
you
may
*NL*
believe
me
.
Mr.
Losberne
's
words
were
,
that
she
would
live
to
bless
us
*NL*
all
for
many
years
to
come
.
I
heard
him
say
so
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
tears
stood
in
Oliver
's
eyes
as
he
recalled
the
scene
which
was
the
*NL*
beginning
of
so
much
happiness
;
and
the
gentleman
turned
his
face
away
,
*NL*
and
remained
silent
,
for
some
minutes
.
Oliver
thought
he
heard
him
*NL*
sob
,
more
than
once
;
but
he
feared
to
interrupt
him
by
any
fresh
*NL*
remark
--
for
he
could
well
guess
what
his
feelings
were
--
and
so
stood
*NL*
apart
,
feigning
to
be
occupied
with
his
nosegay
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
time
,
Mr.
Giles
,
with
the
white
nightcap
on
,
had
been
sitting
*NL*
on
the
steps
of
the
chaise
,
supporting
an
elbow
on
each
knee
,
and
*NL*
wiping
his
eyes
with
a
blue
cotton
pocket-handkerchief
dotted
with
*NL*
white
spots
.
That
the
honest
fellow
had
not
been
feigning
emotion
,
was
*NL*
abundantly
demonstrated
by
the
very
red
eyes
with
which
he
regarded
the
*NL*
young
gentleman
,
when
he
turned
round
and
addressed
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
think
you
had
better
go
on
to
my
mother
's
in
the
chaise
,
Giles
,
'
*NL*
said
he
.
'
I
would
rather
walk
slowly
on
,
so
as
to
gain
a
little
time
*NL*
before
I
see
her
.
You
can
say
I
am
coming
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
beg
your
pardon
,
Mr.
Harry
,
'
said
Giles
:
giving
a
final
polish
to
*NL*
his
ruffled
countenance
with
the
handkerchief
;
`
but
if
you
would
leave
*NL*
the
postboy
to
say
that
,
I
should
be
very
much
obliged
to
you
.
It
*NL*
would
n't
be
proper
for
the
maids
to
see
me
in
this
state
,
sir
;
I
should
*NL*
never
have
any
more
authority
with
them
if
they
did
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
'
rejoined
Harry
Maylie
,
smiling
,
`
you
can
do
as
you
like
.
Let
*NL*
him
go
on
with
the
luggage
,
if
you
wish
it
,
and
do
you
follow
with
us
.
*NL*
Only
first
exchange
that
nightcap
for
some
more
appropriate
covering
,
*NL*
or
we
shall
be
taken
for
madmen
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Giles
,
reminded
of
his
unbecoming
costume
,
snatched
off
and
*NL*
pocketed
his
nightcap
;
and
substituted
a
hat
,
of
grave
and
sober
shape
,
*NL*
which
he
took
out
of
the
chaise
.
This
done
,
the
postboy
drove
off
;
*NL*
Giles
,
Mr.
Maylie
,
and
Oliver
,
followed
at
their
leisure
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
walked
along
,
Oliver
glanced
from
time
to
time
with
much
*NL*
interest
and
curiosity
at
the
new
comer
.
He
seemed
about
*NL*
five-and-twenty
years
of
age
,
and
was
of
the
middle
height
;
his
*NL*
countenance
was
frank
and
handsome
;
and
his
demeanor
easy
and
*NL*
prepossessing
.
Notwithstanding
the
difference
between
youth
and
age
,
*NL*
he
bore
so
strong
a
likeness
to
the
old
lady
,
that
Oliver
would
have
*NL*
had
no
great
difficulty
in
imagining
their
relationship
,
if
he
had
not
*NL*
already
spoken
of
her
as
his
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Maylie
was
anxiously
waiting
to
receive
her
son
when
he
reached
*NL*
the
cottage
.
The
meeting
did
not
take
place
without
great
emotion
on
*NL*
both
sides
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Mother
!
'
whispered
the
young
man
;
`
why
did
you
not
write
before
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
did
,
'
replied
Mrs.
Maylie
;
`
but
,
on
reflection
,
I
determined
to
keep
*NL*
back
the
letter
until
I
had
heard
Mr.
Losberne
's
opinion
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
why
,
'
said
the
young
man
,
`
why
run
the
chance
of
that
occurring
*NL*
which
so
nearly
happened
?
If
Rose
had
--
I
can
not
utter
that
word
*NL*
now
--
if
this
illness
had
terminated
differently
,
how
could
you
ever
*NL*
have
forgiven
yourself
!
How
could
I
ever
have
know
happiness
again
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
If
that
_
had
_
been
the
case
,
Harry
,
'
said
Mrs.
Maylie
,
'
I
fear
your
*NL*
happiness
would
have
been
effectually
blighted
,
and
that
your
arrival
*NL*
here
,
a
day
sooner
or
a
day
later
,
would
have
been
of
very
,
very
little
*NL*
import
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
who
can
wonder
if
it
be
so
,
mother
?
'
rejoined
the
young
man
;
`
or
*NL*
why
should
I
say
,
_
if
_
?
--
It
is
--
it
is
--
you
know
it
,
mother
--
you
must
*NL*
know
it
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
know
that
she
deserves
the
best
and
purest
love
the
heart
of
man
can
*NL*
offer
,
'
said
Mrs.
Maylie
;
'
I
know
that
the
devotion
and
affection
of
*NL*
her
nature
require
no
ordinary
return
,
but
one
that
shall
be
deep
and
*NL*
lasting
.
If
I
did
not
feel
this
,
and
know
,
besides
,
that
a
changed
*NL*
behaviour
in
one
she
loved
would
break
her
heart
,
I
should
not
feel
my
*NL*
task
so
difficult
of
performance
,
or
have
to
encounter
so
many
*NL*
struggles
in
my
own
bosom
,
when
I
take
what
seems
to
me
to
be
the
*NL*
strict
line
of
duty
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
This
is
unkind
,
mother
,
'
said
Harry
.
`
Do
you
still
suppose
that
I
am
*NL*
a
boy
ignorant
of
my
own
mind
,
and
mistaking
the
impulses
of
my
own
*NL*
soul
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
think
,
my
dear
son
,
'
returned
Mrs.
Maylie
,
laying
her
hand
upon
his
*NL*
shoulder
,
`
that
youth
has
many
generous
impulses
which
do
not
last
;
and
*NL*
that
among
them
are
some
,
which
,
being
gratified
,
become
only
the
more
*NL*
fleeting
.
Above
all
,
I
think
'
said
the
lady
,
fixing
her
eyes
on
her
*NL*
son
's
face
,
`
that
if
an
enthusiastic
,
ardent
,
and
ambitious
man
marry
a
*NL*
wife
on
whose
name
there
is
a
stain
,
which
,
though
it
originate
in
no
*NL*
fault
of
hers
,
may
be
visited
by
cold
and
sordid
people
upon
her
,
and
*NL*
upon
his
children
also
:
and
,
in
exact
proportion
to
his
success
in
the
*NL*
world
,
be
cast
in
his
teeth
,
and
made
the
subject
of
sneers
against
*NL*
him
:
he
may
,
no
matter
how
generous
and
good
his
nature
,
one
day
*NL*
repent
of
the
connection
he
formed
in
early
life
.
And
she
may
have
the
*NL*
pain
of
knowing
that
he
does
so
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Mother
,
'
said
the
young
man
,
impatiently
,
`
he
would
be
a
selfish
*NL*
brute
,
unworthy
alike
of
the
name
of
man
and
of
the
woman
you
describe
,
*NL*
who
acted
thus
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
think
so
now
,
Harry
,
'
replied
his
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
ever
will
!
'
said
the
young
man
.
`
The
mental
agony
I
have
*NL*
suffered
,
during
the
last
two
days
,
wrings
from
me
the
avowal
to
you
of
*NL*
a
passion
which
,
as
you
well
know
,
is
not
one
of
yesterday
,
nor
one
I
*NL*
have
lightly
formed
.
On
Rose
,
sweet
,
gentle
girl
!
my
heart
is
set
,
as
*NL*
firmly
as
ever
heart
of
man
was
set
on
woman
.
I
have
no
thought
,
no
*NL*
view
,
no
hope
in
life
,
beyond
her
;
and
if
you
oppose
me
in
this
great
*NL*
stake
,
you
take
my
peace
and
happiness
in
your
hands
,
and
cast
them
to
*NL*
the
wind
.
Mother
,
think
better
of
this
,
and
of
me
,
and
do
not
*NL*
disregard
the
happiness
of
which
you
seem
to
think
so
little
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Harry
,
'
said
Mrs.
Maylie
,
`
it
is
because
I
think
so
much
of
warm
and
*NL*
sensitive
hearts
,
that
I
would
spare
them
from
being
wounded
.
But
we
*NL*
have
said
enough
,
and
more
than
enough
,
on
this
matter
,
just
now
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Let
it
rest
with
Rose
,
then
,
'
interposed
Harry
.
`
You
will
not
press
*NL*
these
overstrained
opinions
of
yours
,
so
far
,
as
to
throw
any
obstacle
*NL*
in
my
way
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
will
not
,
'
rejoined
Mrs.
Maylie
;
`
but
I
would
have
you
consider
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
_
have
_
considered
!
'
was
the
impatient
reply
;
`
Mother
,
I
have
*NL*
considered
,
years
and
years
.
I
have
considered
,
ever
since
I
have
been
*NL*
capable
of
serious
reflection
.
My
feelings
remain
unchanged
,
as
they
*NL*
ever
will
;
and
why
should
I
suffer
the
pain
of
a
delay
in
giving
them
*NL*
vent
,
which
can
be
productive
of
no
earthly
good
?
No
!
Before
I
leave
*NL*
this
place
,
Rose
shall
hear
me
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
She
shall
,
'
said
Mrs.
Maylie
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
There
is
something
in
your
manner
,
which
would
almost
imply
that
she
*NL*
will
hear
me
coldly
,
mother
,
'
said
the
young
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Not
coldly
,
'
rejoined
the
old
lady
;
`
far
from
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
How
then
?
'
urged
the
young
man
.
`
She
has
formed
no
other
attachment
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
indeed
,
'
replied
his
mother
;
`
you
have
,
or
I
mistake
,
too
strong
a
*NL*
hold
on
her
affections
already
.
What
I
would
say
,
'
resumed
the
old
*NL*
lady
,
stopping
her
son
as
he
was
about
to
speak
,
`
is
this
.
Before
you
*NL*
stake
your
all
on
this
chance
;
before
you
suffer
yourself
to
be
carried
*NL*
to
the
highest
point
of
hope
;
reflect
for
a
few
moments
,
my
dear
child
,
*NL*
on
Rose
's
history
,
and
consider
what
effect
the
knowledge
of
her
*NL*
doubtful
birth
may
have
on
her
decision
:
devoted
as
she
is
to
us
,
with
*NL*
all
the
intensity
of
her
noble
mind
,
and
with
that
perfect
sacrifice
of
*NL*
self
which
,
in
all
matters
,
great
or
trifling
,
has
always
been
her
*NL*
characteristic
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
do
you
mean
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
I
leave
you
to
discover
,
'
replied
Mrs.
Maylie
.
'
I
must
go
back
*NL*
to
her
.
God
bless
you
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
shall
see
you
again
to-night
?
'
said
the
young
man
,
eagerly
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
By
and
by
,
'
replied
the
lady
;
`
when
I
leave
Rose
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
will
tell
her
I
am
here
?
'
said
Harry
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Of
course
,
'
replied
Mrs.
Maylie
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
say
how
anxious
I
have
been
,
and
how
much
I
have
suffered
,
and
how
*NL*
I
long
to
see
her
.
You
will
not
refuse
to
do
this
,
mother
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
'
said
the
old
lady
;
'
I
will
tell
her
all
.
'
And
pressing
her
son
's
*NL*
hand
,
affectionately
,
she
hastened
from
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Losberne
and
Oliver
had
remained
at
another
end
of
the
apartment
*NL*
while
this
hurried
conversation
was
proceeding
.
The
former
now
held
*NL*
out
his
hand
to
Harry
Maylie
;
and
hearty
salutations
were
exchanged
*NL*
between
them
.
The
doctor
then
communicated
,
in
reply
to
multifarious
*NL*
questions
from
his
young
friend
,
a
precise
account
of
his
patient
's
*NL*
situation
;
which
was
quite
as
consolatory
and
full
of
promise
,
as
*NL*
Oliver
's
statement
had
encouraged
him
to
hope
;
and
to
the
whole
of
*NL*
which
,
Mr.
Giles
,
who
affected
to
be
busy
about
the
luggage
,
listened
*NL*
with
greedy
ears
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Have
you
shot
anything
particular
,
lately
,
Giles
?
'
inquired
the
*NL*
doctor
,
when
he
had
concluded
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Nothing
particular
,
sir
,
'
replied
Mr.
Giles
,
colouring
up
to
the
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Nor
catching
any
thieves
,
nor
identifying
any
house-breakers
?
'
said
*NL*
the
doctor
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
None
at
all
,
sir
,
'
replied
Mr.
Giles
,
with
much
gravity
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
'
said
the
doctor
,
'
I
am
sorry
to
hear
it
,
because
you
do
that
*NL*
sort
of
thing
admirably
.
Pray
,
how
is
Brittles
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
boy
is
very
well
,
sir
,
'
said
Mr.
Giles
,
recovering
his
usual
tone
*NL*
of
patronage
;
`
and
sends
his
respectful
duty
,
sir
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
's
well
,
'
said
the
doctor
.
`
Seeing
you
here
,
reminds
me
,
Mr.
*NL*
Giles
,
that
on
the
day
before
that
on
which
I
was
called
away
so
*NL*
hurriedly
,
I
executed
,
at
the
request
of
your
good
mistress
,
a
small
*NL*
commission
in
your
favour
.
Just
step
into
this
corner
a
moment
,
will
*NL*
you
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Giles
walked
into
the
corner
with
much
importance
,
and
some
wonder
,
*NL*
and
was
honoured
with
a
short
whispering
conference
with
the
doctor
,
on
*NL*
the
termination
of
which
,
he
made
a
great
many
bows
,
and
retired
with
*NL*
steps
of
unusual
stateliness
.
The
subject
matter
of
this
conference
*NL*
was
not
disclosed
in
the
parlour
,
but
the
kitchen
was
speedily
*NL*
enlightened
concerning
it
;
for
Mr.
Giles
walked
straight
thither
,
and
*NL*
having
called
for
a
mug
of
ale
,
announced
,
with
an
air
of
majesty
,
*NL*
which
was
highly
effective
,
that
it
had
pleased
his
mistress
,
in
*NL*
consideration
of
his
gallant
behaviour
on
the
occasion
of
that
*NL*
attempted
robbery
,
to
deposit
,
in
the
local
savings-bank
,
the
sum
of
*NL*
five-and-twenty
pounds
,
for
his
sole
use
and
benefit
.
At
this
,
the
two
*NL*
women-servants
lifted
up
their
hands
and
eyes
,
and
supposed
that
Mr.
*NL*
Giles
,
pulling
out
his
shirt-frill
,
replied
,
`
No
,
no
'
;
and
that
if
they
*NL*
observed
that
he
was
at
all
haughty
to
his
inferiors
,
he
would
thank
*NL*
them
to
tell
him
so
.
And
then
he
made
a
great
many
other
remarks
,
no
*NL*
less
illustrative
of
his
humility
,
which
were
received
with
equal
*NL*
favour
and
applause
,
and
were
,
withal
,
as
original
and
as
much
to
the
*NL*
purpose
,
as
the
remarks
of
great
men
commonly
are
.
*NL*
*NL*
Above
stairs
,
the
remainder
of
the
evening
passed
cheerfully
away
;
for
*NL*
the
doctor
was
in
high
spirits
;
and
however
fatigued
or
thoughtful
*NL*
Harry
Maylie
might
have
been
at
first
,
he
was
not
proof
against
the
*NL*
worthy
gentleman
's
good
humour
,
which
displayed
itself
in
a
great
*NL*
variety
of
sallies
and
professional
recollections
,
and
an
abundance
of
*NL*
small
jokes
,
which
struck
Oliver
as
being
the
drollest
things
he
had
*NL*
ever
heard
,
and
caused
him
to
laugh
proportionately
;
to
the
evident
*NL*
satisfaction
of
the
doctor
,
who
laughed
immoderately
at
himself
,
and
*NL*
made
Harry
laugh
almost
as
heartily
,
by
the
very
force
of
sympathy
.
*NL*
So
,
they
were
as
pleasant
a
party
as
,
under
the
circumstances
,
they
*NL*
could
well
have
been
;
and
it
was
late
before
they
retired
,
with
light
*NL*
and
thankful
hearts
,
to
take
that
rest
of
which
,
after
the
doubt
and
*NL*
suspense
they
had
recently
undergone
,
they
stood
much
in
need
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oliver
rose
next
morning
,
in
better
heart
,
and
went
about
his
usual
*NL*
occupations
,
with
more
hope
and
pleasure
than
he
had
known
for
many
*NL*
days
.
The
birds
were
once
more
hung
out
,
to
sing
,
in
their
old
places
;
*NL*
and
the
sweetest
wild
flowers
that
could
be
found
,
were
once
more
*NL*
gathered
to
gladden
Rose
with
their
beauty
.
The
melancholy
which
had
*NL*
seemed
to
the
sad
eyes
of
the
anxious
boy
to
hang
,
for
days
past
,
over
*NL*
every
object
,
beautiful
as
all
were
,
was
dispelled
by
magic
.
The
dew
*NL*
seemed
to
sparkle
more
brightly
on
the
green
leaves
;
the
air
to
rustle
*NL*
among
them
with
a
sweeter
music
;
and
the
sky
itself
to
look
more
blue
*NL*
and
bright
.
Such
is
the
influence
which
the
condition
of
our
own
*NL*
thoughts
,
exercise
,
even
over
the
appearance
of
external
objects
.
Men
*NL*
who
look
on
nature
,
and
their
fellow-men
,
and
cry
that
all
is
dark
and
*NL*
gloomy
,
are
in
the
right
;
but
the
sombre
colours
are
reflections
from
*NL*
their
own
jaundiced
eyes
and
hearts
.
The
real
hues
are
delicate
,
and
*NL*
need
a
clearer
vision
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
worthy
of
remark
,
and
Oliver
did
not
fail
to
note
it
at
the
time
,
*NL*
that
his
morning
expeditions
were
no
longer
made
alone
.
Harry
Maylie
,
*NL*
after
the
very
first
morning
when
he
met
Oliver
coming
laden
home
,
was
*NL*
seized
with
such
a
passion
for
flowers
,
and
displayed
such
a
taste
in
*NL*
their
arrangement
,
as
left
his
young
companion
far
behind
.
If
Oliver
*NL*
were
behindhand
in
these
respects
,
he
knew
where
the
best
were
to
be
*NL*
found
;
and
morning
after
morning
they
scoured
the
country
together
,
and
*NL*
brought
home
the
fairest
that
blossomed
.
The
window
of
the
young
*NL*
lady
's
chamber
was
opened
now
;
for
she
loved
to
feel
the
rich
summer
*NL*
air
stream
in
,
and
revive
her
with
its
freshness
;
but
there
always
*NL*
stood
in
water
,
just
inside
the
lattice
,
one
particular
little
bunch
,
*NL*
which
was
made
up
with
great
care
,
every
morning
.
Oliver
could
not
*NL*
help
noticing
that
the
withered
flowers
were
never
thrown
away
,
*NL*
although
the
little
vase
was
regularly
replenished
;
nor
,
could
he
help
*NL*
observing
,
that
whenever
the
doctor
came
into
the
garden
,
he
invariably
*NL*
cast
his
eyes
up
to
that
particular
corner
,
and
nodded
his
head
most
*NL*
expressively
,
as
he
set
forth
on
his
morning
's
walk
.
Pending
these
*NL*
observations
,
the
days
were
flying
by
;
and
Rose
was
rapidly
recovering
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nor
did
Oliver
's
time
hang
heavy
on
his
hands
,
although
the
young
lady
*NL*
had
not
yet
left
her
chamber
,
and
there
were
no
evening
walks
,
save
now
*NL*
and
then
,
for
a
short
distance
,
with
Mrs.
Maylie
.
He
applied
himself
,
*NL*
with
redoubled
assiduity
,
to
the
instructions
of
the
white-headed
old
*NL*
gentleman
,
and
laboured
so
hard
that
his
quick
progress
surprised
even
*NL*
himself
.
It
was
while
he
was
engaged
in
this
pursuit
,
that
he
was
*NL*
greatly
startled
and
distressed
by
a
most
unexpected
occurrence
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
little
room
in
which
he
was
accustomed
to
sit
,
when
busy
at
his
*NL*
books
,
was
on
the
ground-floor
,
at
the
back
of
the
house
.
It
was
quite
*NL*
a
cottage-room
,
with
a
lattice-window
:
around
which
were
clusters
of
*NL*
jessamine
and
honeysuckle
,
that
crept
over
the
casement
,
and
filled
the
*NL*
place
with
their
delicious
perfume
.
It
looked
into
a
garden
,
whence
a
*NL*
wicket-gate
opened
into
a
small
paddock
;
all
beyond
,
was
fine
*NL*
meadow-land
and
wood
.
There
was
no
other
dwelling
near
,
in
that
*NL*
direction
;
and
the
prospect
it
commanded
was
very
extensive
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
beautiful
evening
,
when
the
first
shades
of
twilight
were
beginning
*NL*
to
settle
upon
the
earth
,
Oliver
sat
at
this
window
,
intent
upon
his
*NL*
books
.
He
had
been
poring
over
them
for
some
time
;
and
,
as
the
day
had
*NL*
been
uncommonly
sultry
,
and
he
had
exerted
himself
a
great
deal
,
it
is
*NL*
no
disparagement
to
the
authors
,
whoever
they
may
have
been
,
to
say
,
*NL*
that
gradually
and
by
slow
degrees
,
he
fell
asleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
a
kind
of
sleep
that
steals
upon
us
sometimes
,
which
,
while
it
*NL*
holds
the
body
prisoner
,
does
not
free
the
mind
from
a
sense
of
things
*NL*
about
it
,
and
enable
it
to
ramble
at
its
pleasure
.
So
far
as
an
*NL*
overpowering
heaviness
,
a
prostration
of
strength
,
and
an
utter
*NL*
inability
to
control
our
thoughts
or
power
of
motion
,
can
be
called
*NL*
sleep
,
this
is
it
;
and
yet
,
we
have
a
consciousness
of
all
that
is
*NL*
going
on
about
us
,
and
,
if
we
dream
at
such
a
time
,
words
which
are
*NL*
really
spoken
,
or
sounds
which
really
exist
at
the
moment
,
accommodate
*NL*
themselves
with
surprising
readiness
to
our
visions
,
until
reality
and
*NL*
imagination
become
so
strangely
blended
that
it
is
afterwards
almost
*NL*
matter
of
impossibility
to
separate
the
two
.
Nor
is
this
,
the
most
*NL*
striking
phenomenon
incidental
to
such
a
state
.
It
is
an
undoubted
*NL*
fact
,
that
although
our
senses
of
touch
and
sight
be
for
the
time
dead
,
*NL*
yet
our
sleeping
thoughts
,
and
the
visionary
scenes
that
pass
before
*NL*
us
,
will
be
influenced
and
materially
influenced
,
by
the
_
mere
silent
*NL*
presence
_
of
some
external
object
;
which
may
not
have
been
near
us
when
*NL*
we
closed
our
eyes
:
and
of
whose
vicinity
we
have
had
no
waking
*NL*
consciousness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oliver
knew
,
perfectly
well
,
that
he
was
in
his
own
little
room
;
that
*NL*
his
books
were
lying
on
the
table
before
him
;
that
the
sweet
air
was
*NL*
stirring
among
the
creeping
plants
outside
.
And
yet
he
was
asleep
.
*NL*
Suddenly
,
the
scene
changed
;
the
air
became
close
and
confined
;
and
he
*NL*
thought
,
with
a
glow
of
terror
,
that
he
was
in
the
Jew
's
house
again
.
*NL*
There
sat
the
hideous
old
man
,
in
his
accustomed
corner
,
pointing
at
*NL*
him
,
and
whispering
to
another
man
,
with
his
face
averted
,
who
sat
*NL*
beside
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Hush
,
my
dear
!
'
he
thought
he
heard
the
Jew
say
;
`
it
is
he
,
sure
*NL*
enough
.
Come
away
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
!
'
the
other
man
seemed
to
answer
;
`
could
I
mistake
him
,
think
you
?
*NL*
If
a
crowd
of
ghosts
were
to
put
themselves
into
his
exact
shape
,
and
*NL*
he
stood
amongst
them
,
there
is
something
that
would
tell
me
how
to
*NL*
point
him
out
.
If
you
buried
him
fifty
feet
deep
,
and
took
me
across
*NL*
his
grave
,
I
fancy
I
should
know
,
if
there
was
n't
a
mark
above
it
,
that
*NL*
he
lay
buried
there
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
seemed
to
say
this
,
with
such
dreadful
hatred
,
that
Oliver
*NL*
awoke
with
the
fear
,
and
started
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
Good
Heaven
!
what
was
that
,
which
sent
the
blood
tingling
to
his
*NL*
heart
,
and
deprived
him
of
his
voice
,
and
of
power
to
move
!
*NL*
There
--
there
--
at
the
window
--
close
before
him
--
so
close
,
that
he
could
*NL*
have
almost
touched
him
before
he
started
back
:
with
his
eyes
peering
*NL*
into
the
room
,
and
meeting
his
:
there
stood
the
Jew
!
And
beside
him
,
*NL*
white
with
rage
or
fear
,
or
both
,
were
the
scowling
features
of
the
man
*NL*
who
had
accosted
him
in
the
inn-yard
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
but
an
instant
,
a
glance
,
a
flash
,
before
his
eyes
;
and
they
*NL*
were
gone
.
But
they
had
recognised
him
,
and
he
them
;
and
their
look
*NL*
was
as
firmly
impressed
upon
his
memory
,
as
if
it
had
been
deeply
*NL*
carved
in
stone
,
and
set
before
him
from
his
birth
.
He
stood
transfixed
*NL*
for
a
moment
;
then
,
leaping
from
the
window
into
the
garden
,
called
*NL*
loudly
for
help
.

CHAPTER
XXXV
*NL*
*NL*
CONTAINING
THE
UNSATISFACTORY
RESULT
OF
OLIVER
'S
ADVENTURE
;
AND
A
*NL*
CONVERSATION
OF
SOME
IMPORTANCE
BETWEEN
HARRY
MAYLIE
AND
ROSE
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
inmates
of
the
house
,
attracted
by
Oliver
's
cries
,
hurried
to
*NL*
the
spot
from
which
they
proceeded
,
they
found
him
,
pale
and
agitated
,
*NL*
pointing
in
the
direction
of
the
meadows
behind
the
house
,
and
scarcely
*NL*
able
to
articulate
the
words
,
`
The
Jew
!
the
Jew
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Giles
was
at
a
loss
to
comprehend
what
this
outcry
meant
;
but
Harry
*NL*
Maylie
,
whose
perceptions
were
something
quicker
,
and
who
had
heard
*NL*
Oliver
's
history
from
his
mother
,
understood
it
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
direction
did
he
take
?
'
he
asked
,
catching
up
a
heavy
stick
which
*NL*
was
standing
in
a
corner
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
,
'
replied
Oliver
,
pointing
out
the
course
the
man
had
taken
;
'
I
*NL*
missed
them
in
an
instant
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Then
,
they
are
in
the
ditch
!
'
said
Harry
.
`
Follow
!
And
keep
as
near
*NL*
me
,
as
you
can
.
'
So
saying
,
he
sprang
over
the
hedge
,
and
darted
off
*NL*
with
a
speed
which
rendered
it
matter
of
exceeding
difficulty
for
the
*NL*
others
to
keep
near
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Giles
followed
as
well
as
he
could
;
and
Oliver
followed
too
;
and
in
the
*NL*
course
of
a
minute
or
two
,
Mr.
Losberne
,
who
had
been
out
walking
,
and
*NL*
just
then
returned
,
tumbled
over
the
hedge
after
them
,
and
picking
*NL*
himself
up
with
more
agility
than
he
could
have
been
supposed
to
*NL*
possess
,
struck
into
the
same
course
at
no
contemptible
speed
,
shouting
*NL*
all
the
while
,
most
prodigiously
,
to
know
what
was
the
matter
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
they
all
went
;
nor
stopped
they
once
to
breathe
,
until
the
leader
,
*NL*
striking
off
into
an
angle
of
the
field
indicated
by
Oliver
,
began
to
*NL*
search
,
narrowly
,
the
ditch
and
hedge
adjoining
;
which
afforded
time
*NL*
for
the
remainder
of
the
party
to
come
up
;
and
for
Oliver
to
*NL*
communicate
to
Mr.
Losberne
the
circumstances
that
had
led
to
so
*NL*
vigorous
a
pursuit
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
search
was
all
in
vain
.
There
were
not
even
the
traces
of
recent
*NL*
footsteps
,
to
be
seen
.
They
stood
now
,
on
the
summit
of
a
little
hill
,
*NL*
commanding
the
open
fields
in
every
direction
for
three
or
four
miles
.
*NL*
There
was
the
village
in
the
hollow
on
the
left
;
but
,
in
order
to
gain
*NL*
that
,
after
pursuing
the
track
Oliver
had
pointed
out
,
the
men
must
*NL*
have
made
a
circuit
of
open
ground
,
which
it
was
impossible
they
could
*NL*
have
accomplished
in
so
short
a
time
.
A
thick
wood
skirted
the
*NL*
meadow-land
in
another
direction
;
but
they
could
not
have
gained
that
*NL*
covert
for
the
same
reason
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
must
have
been
a
dream
,
Oliver
,
'
said
Harry
Maylie
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
no
,
indeed
,
sir
,
'
replied
Oliver
,
shuddering
at
the
very
*NL*
recollection
of
the
old
wretch
's
countenance
;
'
I
saw
him
too
plainly
*NL*
for
that
.
I
saw
them
both
,
as
plainly
as
I
see
you
now
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Who
was
the
other
?
'
inquired
Harry
and
Mr.
Losberne
,
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
very
same
man
I
told
you
of
,
who
came
so
suddenly
upon
me
at
the
*NL*
inn
,
'
said
Oliver
.
`
We
had
our
eyes
fixed
full
upon
each
other
;
and
I
*NL*
could
swear
to
him
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
They
took
this
way
?
'
demanded
Harry
:
`
are
you
sure
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
As
I
am
that
the
men
were
at
the
window
,
'
replied
Oliver
,
pointing
*NL*
down
,
as
he
spoke
,
to
the
hedge
which
divided
the
cottage-garden
from
*NL*
the
meadow
.
`
The
tall
man
leaped
over
,
just
there
;
and
the
Jew
,
*NL*
running
a
few
paces
to
the
right
,
crept
through
that
gap
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
gentlemen
watched
Oliver
's
earnest
face
,
as
he
spoke
,
and
*NL*
looking
from
him
to
each
other
,
seemed
to
feel
satisfied
of
the
*NL*
accuracy
of
what
he
said
.
Still
,
in
no
direction
were
there
any
*NL*
appearances
of
the
trampling
of
men
in
hurried
flight
.
The
grass
was
*NL*
long
;
but
it
was
trodden
down
nowhere
,
save
where
their
own
feet
had
*NL*
crushed
it
.
The
sides
and
brinks
of
the
ditches
were
of
damp
clay
;
but
*NL*
in
no
one
place
could
they
discern
the
print
of
men
's
shoes
,
or
the
*NL*
slightest
mark
which
would
indicate
that
any
feet
had
pressed
the
*NL*
ground
for
hours
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
This
is
strange
!
'
said
Harry
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Strange
?
'
echoed
the
doctor
.
`
Blathers
and
Duff
,
themselves
,
could
*NL*
make
nothing
of
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Notwithstanding
the
evidently
useless
nature
of
their
search
,
they
did
*NL*
not
desist
until
the
coming
on
of
night
rendered
its
further
*NL*
prosecution
hopeless
;
and
even
then
,
they
gave
it
up
with
reluctance
.
*NL*
Giles
was
dispatched
to
the
different
ale-houses
in
the
village
,
*NL*
furnished
with
the
best
description
Oliver
could
give
of
the
appearance
*NL*
and
dress
of
the
strangers
.
Of
these
,
the
Jew
was
,
at
all
events
,
*NL*
sufficiently
remarkable
to
be
remembered
,
supposing
he
had
been
seen
*NL*
drinking
,
or
loitering
about
;
but
Giles
returned
without
any
*NL*
intelligence
,
calculated
to
dispel
or
lessen
the
mystery
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
next
day
,
fresh
search
was
made
,
and
the
inquiries
renewed
;
but
*NL*
with
no
better
success
.
On
the
day
following
,
Oliver
and
Mr.
Maylie
*NL*
repaired
to
the
market-town
,
in
the
hope
of
seeing
or
hearing
something
*NL*
of
the
men
there
;
but
this
effort
was
equally
fruitless
.
After
a
few
*NL*
days
,
the
affair
began
to
be
forgotten
,
as
most
affairs
are
,
when
*NL*
wonder
,
having
no
fresh
food
to
support
it
,
dies
away
of
itself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
Rose
was
rapidly
recovering
.
She
had
left
her
room
:
was
*NL*
able
to
go
out
;
and
mixing
once
more
with
the
family
,
carried
joy
into
*NL*
the
hearts
of
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
although
this
happy
change
had
a
visible
effect
on
the
little
*NL*
circle
;
and
although
cheerful
voices
and
merry
laughter
were
once
more
*NL*
heard
in
the
cottage
;
there
was
at
times
,
an
unwonted
restraint
upon
*NL*
some
there
:
even
upon
Rose
herself
:
which
Oliver
could
not
fail
to
*NL*
remark
.
Mrs.
Maylie
and
her
son
were
often
closeted
together
for
a
*NL*
long
time
;
and
more
than
once
Rose
appeared
with
traces
of
tears
upon
*NL*
her
face
.
After
Mr.
Losberne
had
fixed
a
day
for
his
departure
to
*NL*
Chertsey
,
these
symptoms
increased
;
and
it
became
evident
that
*NL*
something
was
in
progress
which
affected
the
peace
of
the
young
lady
,
*NL*
and
of
somebody
else
besides
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
,
one
morning
,
when
Rose
was
alone
in
the
breakfast-parlour
,
*NL*
Harry
Maylie
entered
;
and
,
with
some
hesitation
,
begged
permission
to
*NL*
speak
with
her
for
a
few
moments
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
A
few
--
a
very
few
--
will
suffice
,
Rose
,
'
said
the
young
man
,
drawing
*NL*
his
chair
towards
her
.
`
What
I
shall
have
to
say
,
has
already
*NL*
presented
itself
to
your
mind
;
the
most
cherished
hopes
of
my
heart
are
*NL*
not
unknown
to
you
,
though
from
my
lips
you
have
not
heard
them
stated
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Rose
had
been
very
pale
from
the
moment
of
his
entrance
;
but
that
might
*NL*
have
been
the
effect
of
her
recent
illness
.
She
merely
bowed
;
and
*NL*
bending
over
some
plants
that
stood
near
,
waited
in
silence
for
him
to
*NL*
proceed
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
--
I
--
ought
to
have
left
here
,
before
,
'
said
Harry
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
should
,
indeed
,
'
replied
Rose
.
`
Forgive
me
for
saying
so
,
but
I
*NL*
wish
you
had
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
was
brought
here
,
by
the
most
dreadful
and
agonising
of
all
*NL*
apprehensions
,
'
said
the
young
man
;
`
the
fear
of
losing
the
one
dear
*NL*
being
on
whom
my
every
wish
and
hope
are
fixed
.
You
had
been
dying
;
*NL*
trembling
between
earth
and
heaven
.
We
know
that
when
the
young
,
the
*NL*
beautiful
,
and
good
,
are
visited
with
sickness
,
their
pure
spirits
*NL*
insensibly
turn
towards
their
bright
home
of
lasting
rest
;
we
know
,
*NL*
Heaven
help
us
!
that
the
best
and
fairest
of
our
kind
,
too
often
fade
*NL*
in
blooming
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
tears
in
the
eyes
of
the
gentle
girl
,
as
these
words
were
*NL*
spoken
;
and
when
one
fell
upon
the
flower
over
which
she
bent
,
and
*NL*
glistened
brightly
in
its
cup
,
making
it
more
beautiful
,
it
seemed
as
*NL*
though
the
outpouring
of
her
fresh
young
heart
,
claimed
kindred
*NL*
naturally
,
with
the
loveliest
things
in
nature
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
A
creature
,
'
continued
the
young
man
,
passionately
,
'
a
creature
as
*NL*
fair
and
innocent
of
guile
as
one
of
God
's
own
angels
,
fluttered
*NL*
between
life
and
death
.
Oh
!
who
could
hope
,
when
the
distant
world
to
*NL*
which
she
was
akin
,
half
opened
to
her
view
,
that
she
would
return
to
*NL*
the
sorrow
and
calamity
of
this
!
Rose
,
Rose
,
to
know
that
you
were
*NL*
passing
away
like
some
soft
shadow
,
which
a
light
from
above
,
casts
*NL*
upon
the
earth
;
to
have
no
hope
that
you
would
be
spared
to
those
who
*NL*
linger
here
;
hardly
to
know
a
reason
why
you
should
be
;
to
feel
that
*NL*
you
belonged
to
that
bright
sphere
whither
so
many
of
the
fairest
and
*NL*
the
best
have
winged
their
early
flight
;
and
yet
to
pray
,
amid
all
*NL*
these
consolations
,
that
you
might
be
restored
to
those
who
loved
*NL*
you
--
these
were
distractions
almost
too
great
to
bear
.
They
were
mine
,
*NL*
by
day
and
night
;
and
with
them
,
came
such
a
rushing
torrent
of
fears
,
*NL*
and
apprehensions
,
and
selfish
regrets
,
lest
you
should
die
,
and
never
*NL*
know
how
devotedly
I
loved
you
,
as
almost
bore
down
sense
and
reason
in
*NL*
its
course
.
You
recovered
.
Day
by
day
,
and
almost
hour
by
hour
,
some
*NL*
drop
of
health
came
back
,
and
mingling
with
the
spent
and
feeble
stream
*NL*
of
life
which
circulated
languidly
within
you
,
swelled
it
again
to
a
*NL*
high
and
rushing
tide
.
I
have
watched
you
change
almost
from
death
,
to
*NL*
life
,
with
eyes
that
turned
blind
with
their
eagerness
and
deep
*NL*
affection
.
Do
not
tell
me
that
you
wish
I
had
lost
this
;
for
it
has
*NL*
softened
my
heart
to
all
mankind
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
did
not
mean
that
,
'
said
Rose
,
weeping
;
'
I
only
wish
you
had
left
*NL*
here
,
that
you
might
have
turned
to
high
and
noble
pursuits
again
;
to
*NL*
pursuits
well
worthy
of
you
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
There
is
no
pursuit
more
worthy
of
me
:
more
worthy
of
the
highest
*NL*
nature
that
exists
:
than
the
struggle
to
win
such
a
heart
as
yours
,
'
*NL*
said
the
young
man
,
taking
her
hand
.
`
Rose
,
my
own
dear
Rose
!
For
*NL*
years
--
for
years
--
I
have
loved
you
;
hoping
to
win
my
way
to
fame
,
and
*NL*
then
come
proudly
home
and
tell
you
it
had
been
pursued
only
for
you
to
*NL*
share
;
thinking
,
in
my
daydreams
,
how
I
would
remind
you
,
in
that
happy
*NL*
moment
,
of
the
many
silent
tokens
I
had
given
of
a
boy
's
attachment
,
*NL*
and
claim
your
hand
,
as
in
redemption
of
some
old
mute
contract
that
*NL*
had
been
sealed
between
us
!
That
time
has
not
arrived
;
but
here
,
with
*NL*
not
fame
won
,
and
no
young
vision
realised
,
I
offer
you
the
heart
so
*NL*
long
your
own
,
and
stake
my
all
upon
the
words
with
which
you
greet
the
*NL*
offer
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Your
behaviour
has
ever
been
kind
and
noble
.
'
said
Rose
,
mastering
the
*NL*
emotions
by
which
she
was
agitated
.
`
As
you
believe
that
I
am
not
*NL*
insensible
or
ungrateful
,
so
hear
my
answer
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
is
,
that
I
may
endeavour
to
deserve
you
;
it
is
,
dear
Rose
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
is
,
'
replied
Rose
,
`
that
you
must
endeavour
to
forget
me
;
not
as
*NL*
your
old
and
dearly-attached
companion
,
for
that
would
wound
me
deeply
;
*NL*
but
,
as
the
object
of
your
love
.
Look
into
the
world
;
think
how
many
*NL*
hearts
you
would
be
proud
to
gain
,
are
there
.
Confide
some
other
*NL*
passion
to
me
,
if
you
will
;
I
will
be
the
truest
,
warmest
,
and
most
*NL*
faithful
friend
you
have
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
pause
,
during
which
,
Rose
,
who
had
covered
her
face
with
*NL*
one
hand
,
gave
free
vent
to
her
tears
.
Harry
still
retained
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
your
reasons
,
Rose
,
'
he
said
,
at
length
,
in
a
low
voice
;
`
your
*NL*
reasons
for
this
decision
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
have
a
right
to
know
them
,
'
rejoined
Rose
.
`
You
can
say
nothing
*NL*
to
alter
my
resolution
.
It
is
a
duty
that
I
must
perform
.
I
owe
it
,
*NL*
alike
to
others
,
and
to
myself
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
To
yourself
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
Harry
.
I
owe
it
to
myself
,
that
I
,
a
friendless
,
portionless
,
*NL*
girl
,
with
a
blight
upon
my
name
,
should
not
give
your
friends
reason
*NL*
to
suspect
that
I
had
sordidly
yielded
to
your
first
passion
,
and
*NL*
fastened
myself
,
a
clog
,
on
all
your
hopes
and
projects
.
I
owe
it
to
*NL*
you
and
yours
,
to
prevent
you
from
opposing
,
in
the
warmth
of
your
*NL*
generous
nature
,
this
great
obstacle
to
your
progress
in
the
world
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
If
your
inclinations
chime
with
your
sense
of
duty
--
'
Harry
began
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
They
do
not
,
'
replied
Rose
,
colouring
deeply
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Then
you
return
my
love
?
'
said
Harry
.
`
Say
but
that
,
dear
Rose
;
say
*NL*
but
that
;
and
soften
the
bitterness
of
this
hard
disappointment
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
If
I
could
have
done
so
,
without
doing
heavy
wrong
to
him
I
loved
,
'
*NL*
rejoined
Rose
,
'
I
could
have
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Have
received
this
declaration
very
differently
?
'
said
Harry
.
`
Do
not
*NL*
conceal
that
from
me
,
at
least
,
Rose
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
could
,
'
said
Rose
.
`
Stay
!
'
she
added
,
disengaging
her
hand
,
`
why
*NL*
should
we
prolong
this
painful
interview
?
Most
painful
to
me
,
and
yet
*NL*
productive
of
lasting
happiness
,
notwithstanding
;
for
it
_
will
_
be
*NL*
happiness
to
know
that
I
once
held
the
high
place
in
your
regard
which
*NL*
I
now
occupy
,
and
every
triumph
you
achieve
in
life
will
animate
me
*NL*
with
new
fortitude
and
firmness
.
Farewell
,
Harry
!
As
we
have
met
*NL*
to-day
,
we
meet
no
more
;
but
in
other
relations
than
those
in
which
*NL*
this
conversation
have
placed
us
,
we
may
be
long
and
happily
entwined
;
*NL*
and
may
every
blessing
that
the
prayers
of
a
true
and
earnest
heart
can
*NL*
call
down
from
the
source
of
all
truth
and
sincerity
,
cheer
and
prosper
*NL*
you
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Another
word
,
Rose
,
'
said
Harry
.
`
Your
reason
in
your
own
words
.
*NL*
From
your
own
lips
,
let
me
hear
it
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
prospect
before
you
,
'
answered
Rose
,
firmly
,
`
is
a
brilliant
one
.
*NL*
All
the
honours
to
which
great
talents
and
powerful
connections
can
*NL*
help
men
in
public
life
,
are
in
store
for
you
.
But
those
connections
*NL*
are
proud
;
and
I
will
neither
mingle
with
such
as
may
hold
in
scorn
the
*NL*
mother
who
gave
me
life
;
nor
bring
disgrace
or
failure
on
the
son
of
*NL*
her
who
has
so
well
supplied
that
mother
's
place
.
In
a
word
,
'
said
the
*NL*
young
lady
,
turning
away
,
as
her
temporary
firmness
forsook
her
,
`
there
*NL*
is
a
stain
upon
my
name
,
which
the
world
visits
on
innocent
heads
.
I
*NL*
will
carry
it
into
no
blood
but
my
own
;
and
the
reproach
shall
rest
*NL*
alone
on
me
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
One
word
more
,
Rose
.
Dearest
Rose
!
one
more
!
'
cried
Harry
,
throwing
*NL*
himself
before
her
.
`
If
I
had
been
less
--
less
fortunate
,
the
world
*NL*
would
call
it
--
if
some
obscure
and
peaceful
life
had
been
my
*NL*
destiny
--
if
I
had
been
poor
,
sick
,
helpless
--
would
you
have
turned
from
*NL*
me
then
?
Or
has
my
probable
advancement
to
riches
and
honour
,
given
*NL*
this
scruple
birth
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Do
not
press
me
to
reply
,
'
answered
Rose
.
`
The
question
does
not
*NL*
arise
,
and
never
will
.
It
is
unfair
,
almost
unkind
,
to
urge
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
If
your
answer
be
what
I
almost
dare
to
hope
it
is
,
'
retorted
Harry
,
*NL*
`
it
will
shed
a
gleam
of
happiness
upon
my
lonely
way
,
and
light
the
*NL*
path
before
me
.
It
is
not
an
idle
thing
to
do
so
much
,
by
the
*NL*
utterance
of
a
few
brief
words
,
for
one
who
loves
you
beyond
all
else
.
*NL*
Oh
,
Rose
:
in
the
name
of
my
ardent
and
enduring
attachment
;
in
the
name
*NL*
of
all
I
have
suffered
for
you
,
and
all
you
doom
me
to
undergo
;
answer
*NL*
me
this
one
question
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Then
,
if
your
lot
had
been
differently
cast
,
'
rejoined
Rose
;
`
if
you
*NL*
had
been
even
a
little
,
but
not
so
far
,
above
me
;
if
I
could
have
been
*NL*
a
help
and
comfort
to
you
in
any
humble
scene
of
peace
and
retirement
,
*NL*
and
not
a
blot
and
drawback
in
ambitious
and
distinguished
crowds
;
I
*NL*
should
have
been
spared
this
trial
.
I
have
every
reason
to
be
happy
,
*NL*
very
happy
,
now
;
but
then
,
Harry
,
I
own
I
should
have
been
happier
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Busy
recollections
of
old
hopes
,
cherished
as
a
girl
,
long
ago
,
crowded
*NL*
into
the
mind
of
Rose
,
while
making
this
avowal
;
but
they
brought
tears
*NL*
with
them
,
as
old
hopes
will
when
they
come
back
withered
;
and
they
*NL*
relieved
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
can
not
help
this
weakness
,
and
it
makes
my
purpose
stronger
,
'
said
*NL*
Rose
,
extending
her
hand
.
'
I
must
leave
you
now
,
indeed
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
ask
one
promise
,
'
said
Harry
.
`
Once
,
and
only
once
more
,
--
say
*NL*
within
a
year
,
but
it
may
be
much
sooner
,
--
I
may
speak
to
you
again
on
*NL*
this
subject
,
for
the
last
time
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Not
to
press
me
to
alter
my
right
determination
,
'
replied
Rose
,
with
a
*NL*
melancholy
smile
;
`
it
will
be
useless
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
'
said
Harry
;
`
to
hear
you
repeat
it
,
if
you
will
--
finally
repeat
*NL*
it
!
I
will
lay
at
your
feet
,
whatever
of
station
of
fortune
I
may
*NL*
possess
;
and
if
you
still
adhere
to
your
present
resolution
,
will
not
*NL*
seek
,
by
word
or
act
,
to
change
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Then
let
it
be
so
,
'
rejoined
Rose
;
`
it
is
but
one
pang
the
more
,
and
*NL*
by
that
time
I
may
be
enabled
to
bear
it
better
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
extended
her
hand
again
.
But
the
young
man
caught
her
to
his
*NL*
bosom
;
and
imprinting
one
kiss
on
her
beautiful
forehead
,
hurried
from
*NL*
the
room
.

CHAPTER
XXXVI
*NL*
*NL*
IS
A
VERY
SHORT
ONE
,
AND
MAY
APPEAR
OF
NO
GREAT
IMPORTANCE
IN
ITS
*NL*
PLACE
,
BUT
IT
SHOULD
BE
READ
NOTWITHSTANDING
,
AS
A
SEQUEL
TO
THE
LAST
,
*NL*
AND
A
KEY
TO
ONE
THAT
WILL
FOLLOW
WHEN
ITS
TIME
ARRIVES
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
so
you
are
resolved
to
be
my
travelling
companion
this
morning
;
*NL*
eh
?
'
said
the
doctor
,
as
Harry
Maylie
joined
him
and
Oliver
at
the
*NL*
breakfast-table
.
`
Why
,
you
are
not
in
the
same
mind
or
intention
two
*NL*
half-hours
together
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
will
tell
me
a
different
tale
one
of
these
days
,
'
said
Harry
,
*NL*
colouring
without
any
perceptible
reason
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
hope
I
may
have
good
cause
to
do
so
,
'
replied
Mr.
Losberne
;
`
though
*NL*
I
confess
I
do
n't
think
I
shall
.
But
yesterday
morning
you
had
made
up
*NL*
your
mind
,
in
a
great
hurry
,
to
stay
here
,
and
to
accompany
your
*NL*
mother
,
like
a
dutiful
son
,
to
the
sea-side
.
Before
noon
,
you
announce
*NL*
that
you
are
going
to
do
me
the
honour
of
accompanying
me
as
far
as
I
*NL*
go
,
on
your
road
to
London
.
And
at
night
,
you
urge
me
,
with
great
*NL*
mystery
,
to
start
before
the
ladies
are
stirring
;
the
consequence
of
*NL*
which
is
,
that
young
Oliver
here
is
pinned
down
to
his
breakfast
when
*NL*
he
ought
to
be
ranging
the
meadows
after
botanical
phenomena
of
all
*NL*
kinds
.
Too
bad
,
is
n't
it
,
Oliver
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
should
have
been
very
sorry
not
to
have
been
at
home
when
you
and
*NL*
Mr.
Maylie
went
away
,
sir
,
'
rejoined
Oliver
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
's
a
fine
fellow
,
'
said
the
doctor
;
`
you
shall
come
and
see
me
*NL*
when
you
return
.
But
,
to
speak
seriously
,
Harry
;
has
any
communication
*NL*
from
the
great
nobs
produced
this
sudden
anxiety
on
your
part
to
be
*NL*
gone
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
great
nobs
,
'
replied
Harry
,
`
under
which
designation
,
I
presume
,
*NL*
you
include
my
most
stately
uncle
,
have
not
communicated
with
me
at
*NL*
all
,
since
I
have
been
here
;
nor
,
at
this
time
of
the
year
,
is
it
*NL*
likely
that
anything
would
occur
to
render
necessary
my
immediate
*NL*
attendance
among
them
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
'
said
the
doctor
,
`
you
are
a
queer
fellow
.
But
of
course
they
*NL*
will
get
you
into
parliament
at
the
election
before
Christmas
,
and
*NL*
these
sudden
shiftings
and
changes
are
no
bad
preparation
for
political
*NL*
life
.
There
's
something
in
that
.
Good
training
is
always
desirable
,
*NL*
whether
the
race
be
for
place
,
cup
,
or
sweepstakes
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Harry
Maylie
looked
as
if
he
could
have
followed
up
this
short
dialogue
*NL*
by
one
or
two
remarks
that
would
have
staggered
the
doctor
not
a
*NL*
little
;
but
he
contented
himself
with
saying
,
`
We
shall
see
,
'
and
*NL*
pursued
the
subject
no
farther
.
The
post-chaise
drove
up
to
the
door
*NL*
shortly
afterwards
;
and
Giles
coming
in
for
the
luggage
,
the
good
*NL*
doctor
bustled
out
,
to
see
it
packed
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oliver
,
'
said
Harry
Maylie
,
in
a
low
voice
,
`
let
me
speak
a
word
with
*NL*
you
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Oliver
walked
into
the
window-recess
to
which
Mr.
Maylie
beckoned
him
;
*NL*
much
surprised
at
the
mixture
of
sadness
and
boisterous
spirits
,
which
*NL*
his
whole
behaviour
displayed
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
can
write
well
now
?
'
said
Harry
,
laying
his
hand
upon
his
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
hope
so
,
sir
,
'
replied
Oliver
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
shall
not
be
at
home
again
,
perhaps
for
some
time
;
I
wish
you
would
*NL*
write
to
me
--
say
once
a
fort-night
:
every
alternate
Monday
:
to
the
*NL*
General
Post
Office
in
London
.
Will
you
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
!
certainly
,
sir
;
I
shall
be
proud
to
do
it
,
'
exclaimed
Oliver
,
*NL*
greatly
delighted
with
the
commission
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
should
like
to
know
how
--
how
my
mother
and
Miss
Maylie
are
,
'
said
*NL*
the
young
man
;
`
and
you
can
fill
up
a
sheet
by
telling
me
what
walks
*NL*
you
take
,
and
what
you
talk
about
,
and
whether
she
--
they
,
I
mean
--
seem
*NL*
happy
and
quite
well
.
You
understand
me
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
!
quite
,
sir
,
quite
,
'
replied
Oliver
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
would
rather
you
did
not
mention
it
to
them
,
'
said
Harry
,
hurrying
*NL*
over
his
words
;
`
because
it
might
make
my
mother
anxious
to
write
to
me
*NL*
oftener
,
and
it
is
a
trouble
and
worry
to
her
.
Let
it
be
a
secret
*NL*
between
you
and
me
;
and
mind
you
tell
me
everything
!
I
depend
upon
*NL*
you
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Oliver
,
quite
elated
and
honoured
by
a
sense
of
his
importance
,
*NL*
faithfully
promised
to
be
secret
and
explicit
in
his
communications
.
*NL*
Mr.
Maylie
took
leave
of
him
,
with
many
assurances
of
his
regard
and
*NL*
protection
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
doctor
was
in
the
chaise
;
Giles
-LRB-
who
,
it
had
been
arranged
,
should
*NL*
be
left
behind
-RRB-
held
the
door
open
in
his
hand
;
and
the
women-servants
*NL*
were
in
the
garden
,
looking
on
.
Harry
cast
one
slight
glance
at
the
*NL*
latticed
window
,
and
jumped
into
the
carriage
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Drive
on
!
'
he
cried
,
`
hard
,
fast
,
full
gallop
!
Nothing
short
of
*NL*
flying
will
keep
pace
with
me
,
to-day
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Halloa
!
'
cried
the
doctor
,
letting
down
the
front
glass
in
a
great
*NL*
hurry
,
and
shouting
to
the
postillion
;
`
something
very
short
of
flying
*NL*
will
keep
pace
with
_
me
_
.
Do
you
hear
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
Jingling
and
clattering
,
till
distance
rendered
its
noise
inaudible
,
*NL*
and
its
rapid
progress
only
perceptible
to
the
eye
,
the
vehicle
wound
*NL*
its
way
along
the
road
,
almost
hidden
in
a
cloud
of
dust
:
now
wholly
*NL*
disappearing
,
and
now
becoming
visible
again
,
as
intervening
objects
,
*NL*
or
the
intricacies
of
the
way
,
permitted
.
It
was
not
until
even
the
*NL*
dusty
cloud
was
no
longer
to
be
seen
,
that
the
gazers
dispersed
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
there
was
one
looker-on
,
who
remained
with
eyes
fixed
upon
the
spot
*NL*
where
the
carriage
had
disappeared
,
long
after
it
was
many
miles
away
;
*NL*
for
,
behind
the
white
curtain
which
had
shrouded
her
from
view
when
*NL*
Harry
raised
his
eyes
towards
the
window
,
sat
Rose
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
seems
in
high
spirits
and
happy
,
'
she
said
,
at
length
.
'
I
feared
*NL*
for
a
time
he
might
be
otherwise
.
I
was
mistaken
.
I
am
very
,
very
*NL*
glad
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Tears
are
signs
of
gladness
as
well
as
grief
;
but
those
which
coursed
*NL*
down
Rose
's
face
,
as
she
sat
pensively
at
the
window
,
still
gazing
in
*NL*
the
same
direction
,
seemed
to
tell
more
of
sorrow
than
of
joy
.

CHAPTER
XXXVII
*NL*
*NL*
IN
WHICH
THE
READER
MAY
PERCEIVE
A
CONTRAST
,
NOT
UNCOMMON
IN
*NL*
MATRIMONIAL
CASES
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bumble
sat
in
the
workhouse
parlour
,
with
his
eyes
moodily
fixed
on
*NL*
the
cheerless
grate
,
whence
,
as
it
was
summer
time
,
no
brighter
gleam
*NL*
proceeded
,
than
the
reflection
of
certain
sickly
rays
of
the
sun
,
which
*NL*
were
sent
back
from
its
cold
and
shining
surface
.
A
paper
fly-cage
*NL*
dangled
from
the
ceiling
,
to
which
he
occasionally
raised
his
eyes
in
*NL*
gloomy
thought
;
and
,
as
the
heedless
insects
hovered
round
the
gaudy
*NL*
net-work
,
Mr.
Bumble
would
heave
a
deep
sigh
,
while
a
more
gloomy
*NL*
shadow
overspread
his
countenance
.
Mr.
Bumble
was
meditating
;
it
might
*NL*
be
that
the
insects
brought
to
mind
,
some
painful
passage
in
his
own
*NL*
past
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nor
was
Mr.
Bumble
's
gloom
the
only
thing
calculated
to
awaken
a
*NL*
pleasing
melancholy
in
the
bosom
of
a
spectator
.
There
were
not
wanting
*NL*
other
appearances
,
and
those
closely
connected
with
his
own
person
,
*NL*
which
announced
that
a
great
change
had
taken
place
in
the
position
of
*NL*
his
affairs
.
The
laced
coat
,
and
the
cocked
hat
;
where
were
they
?
He
*NL*
still
wore
knee-breeches
,
and
dark
cotton
stockings
on
his
nether
*NL*
limbs
;
but
they
were
not
_
the
_
breeches
.
The
coat
was
wide-skirted
;
*NL*
and
in
that
respect
like
_
the
_
coat
,
but
,
oh
how
different
!
The
mighty
*NL*
cocked
hat
was
replaced
by
a
modest
round
one
.
Mr.
Bumble
was
no
*NL*
longer
a
beadle
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
are
some
promotions
in
life
,
which
,
independent
of
the
more
*NL*
substantial
rewards
they
offer
,
require
peculiar
value
and
dignity
from
*NL*
the
coats
and
waistcoats
connected
with
them
.
A
field-marshal
has
his
*NL*
uniform
;
a
bishop
his
silk
apron
;
a
counsellor
his
silk
gown
;
a
beadle
*NL*
his
cocked
hat
.
Strip
the
bishop
of
his
apron
,
or
the
beadle
of
his
*NL*
hat
and
lace
;
what
are
they
?
Men
.
Mere
men
.
Dignity
,
and
even
*NL*
holiness
too
,
sometimes
,
are
more
questions
of
coat
and
waistcoat
than
*NL*
some
people
imagine
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bumble
had
married
Mrs.
Corney
,
and
was
master
of
the
workhouse
.
*NL*
Another
beadle
had
come
into
power
.
On
him
the
cocked
hat
,
gold-laced
*NL*
coat
,
and
staff
,
had
all
three
descended
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
to-morrow
two
months
it
was
done
!
'
said
Mr.
Bumble
,
with
a
sigh
.
*NL*
`
It
seems
a
age
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bumble
might
have
meant
that
he
had
concentrated
a
whole
existence
*NL*
of
happiness
into
the
short
space
of
eight
weeks
;
but
the
sigh
--
there
*NL*
was
a
vast
deal
of
meaning
in
the
sigh
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
sold
myself
,
'
said
Mr.
Bumble
,
pursuing
the
same
train
of
relection
,
*NL*
`
for
six
teaspoons
,
a
pair
of
sugar-tongs
,
and
a
milk-pot
;
with
a
small
*NL*
quantity
of
second-hand
furniture
,
and
twenty
pound
in
money
.
I
went
*NL*
very
reasonable
.
Cheap
,
dirt
cheap
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Cheap
!
'
cried
a
shrill
voice
in
Mr.
Bumble
's
ear
:
`
you
would
have
been
*NL*
dear
at
any
price
;
and
dear
enough
I
paid
for
you
,
Lord
above
knows
*NL*
that
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bumble
turned
,
and
encountered
the
face
of
his
interesting
consort
,
*NL*
who
,
imperfectly
comprehending
the
few
words
she
had
overheard
of
his
*NL*
complaint
,
had
hazarded
the
foregoing
remark
at
a
venture
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Mrs.
Bumble
,
ma'am
!
'
said
Mr.
Bumble
,
with
a
sentimental
sternness
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
!
'
cried
the
lady
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Have
the
goodness
to
look
at
me
,
'
said
Mr.
Bumble
,
fixing
his
eyes
*NL*
upon
her
.
-LRB-
If
she
stands
such
a
eye
as
that
,
'
said
Mr.
Bumble
to
*NL*
himself
,
`
she
can
stand
anything
.
It
is
a
eye
I
never
knew
to
fail
*NL*
with
paupers
.
If
it
fails
with
her
,
my
power
is
gone
.
'
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
Whether
an
exceedingly
small
expansion
of
eye
be
sufficient
to
quell
*NL*
paupers
,
who
,
being
lightly
fed
,
are
in
no
very
high
condition
;
or
*NL*
whether
the
late
Mrs.
Corney
was
particularly
proof
against
eagle
*NL*
glances
;
are
matters
of
opinion
.
The
matter
of
fact
,
is
,
that
the
*NL*
matron
was
in
no
way
overpowered
by
Mr.
Bumble
's
scowl
,
but
,
on
the
*NL*
contrary
,
treated
it
with
great
disdain
,
and
even
raised
a
laugh
*NL*
thereat
,
which
sounded
as
though
it
were
genuine
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
hearing
this
most
unexpected
sound
,
Mr.
Bumble
looked
,
first
*NL*
incredulous
,
and
afterwards
amazed
.
He
then
relapsed
into
his
former
*NL*
state
;
nor
did
he
rouse
himself
until
his
attention
was
again
awakened
*NL*
by
the
voice
of
his
partner
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Are
you
going
to
sit
snoring
there
,
all
day
?
'
inquired
Mrs.
Bumble
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
am
going
to
sit
here
,
as
long
as
I
think
proper
,
ma'am
,
'
rejoined
*NL*
Mr.
Bumble
;
`
and
although
I
was
_
not
_
snoring
,
I
shall
snore
,
gape
,
*NL*
sneeze
,
laugh
,
or
cry
,
as
the
humour
strikes
me
;
such
being
my
*NL*
prerogative
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
_
Your
_
prerogative
!
'
sneered
Mrs.
Bumble
,
with
ineffable
contempt
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
said
the
word
,
ma'am
,
'
said
Mr.
Bumble
.
`
The
prerogative
of
a
man
*NL*
is
to
command
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
what
's
the
prerogative
of
a
woman
,
in
the
name
of
Goodness
?
'
cried
*NL*
the
relict
of
Mr.
Corney
deceased
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
To
obey
,
ma'am
,
'
thundered
Mr.
Bumble
.
`
Your
late
unfortunate
husband
*NL*
should
have
taught
it
you
;
and
then
,
perhaps
,
he
might
have
been
alive
*NL*
now
.
I
wish
he
was
,
poor
man
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Bumble
,
seeing
at
a
glance
,
that
the
decisive
moment
had
now
*NL*
arrived
,
and
that
a
blow
struck
for
the
mastership
on
one
side
or
*NL*
other
,
must
necessarily
be
final
and
conclusive
,
no
sooner
heard
this
*NL*
allusion
to
the
dead
and
gone
,
than
she
dropped
into
a
chair
,
and
with
*NL*
a
loud
scream
that
Mr.
Bumble
was
a
hard-hearted
brute
,
fell
into
a
*NL*
paroxysm
of
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
tears
were
not
the
things
to
find
their
way
to
Mr.
Bumble
's
soul
;
*NL*
his
heart
was
waterproof
.
Like
washable
beaver
hats
that
improve
with
*NL*
rain
,
his
nerves
were
rendered
stouter
and
more
vigorous
,
by
showers
of
*NL*
tears
,
which
,
being
tokens
of
weakness
,
and
so
far
tacit
admissions
of
*NL*
his
own
power
,
pleased
and
exalted
him
.
He
eyed
his
good
lady
with
*NL*
looks
of
great
satisfaction
,
and
begged
,
in
an
encouraging
manner
,
that
*NL*
she
should
cry
her
hardest
:
the
exercise
being
looked
upon
,
by
the
*NL*
faculty
,
as
strongly
conducive
to
health
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
opens
the
lungs
,
washes
the
countenance
,
exercises
the
eyes
,
and
*NL*
softens
down
the
temper
,
'
said
Mr.
Bumble
.
`
So
cry
away
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
discharged
himself
of
this
pleasantry
,
Mr.
Bumble
took
his
hat
*NL*
from
a
peg
,
and
putting
it
on
,
rather
rakishly
,
on
one
side
,
as
a
man
*NL*
might
,
who
felt
he
had
asserted
his
superiority
in
a
becoming
manner
,
*NL*
thrust
his
hands
into
his
pockets
,
and
sauntered
towards
the
door
,
with
*NL*
much
ease
and
waggishness
depicted
in
his
whole
appearance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
Mrs.
Corney
that
was
,
had
tried
the
tears
,
because
they
were
less
*NL*
troublesome
than
a
manual
assault
;
but
,
she
was
quite
prepared
to
make
*NL*
trial
of
the
latter
mode
of
proceeding
,
as
Mr.
Bumble
was
not
long
in
*NL*
discovering
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
proof
he
experienced
of
the
fact
,
was
conveyed
in
a
hollow
*NL*
sound
,
immediately
succeeded
by
the
sudden
flying
off
of
his
hat
to
the
*NL*
opposite
end
of
the
room
.
This
preliminary
proceeding
laying
bare
his
*NL*
head
,
the
expert
lady
,
clasping
him
tightly
round
the
throat
with
one
*NL*
hand
,
inflicted
a
shower
of
blows
-LRB-
dealt
with
singular
vigour
and
*NL*
dexterity
-RRB-
upon
it
with
the
other
.
This
done
,
she
created
a
little
*NL*
variety
by
scratching
his
face
,
and
tearing
his
hair
;
and
,
having
,
by
*NL*
this
time
,
inflicted
as
much
punishment
as
she
deemed
necessary
for
the
*NL*
offence
,
she
pushed
him
over
a
chair
,
which
was
luckily
well
situated
*NL*
for
the
purpose
:
and
defied
him
to
talk
about
his
prerogative
again
,
*NL*
if
he
dared
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Get
up
!
'
said
Mrs.
Bumble
,
in
a
voice
of
command
.
`
And
take
yourself
*NL*
away
from
here
,
unless
you
want
me
to
do
something
desperate
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bumble
rose
with
a
very
rueful
countenance
:
wondering
much
what
*NL*
something
desperate
might
be
.
Picking
up
his
hat
,
he
looked
towards
*NL*
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Are
you
going
?
'
demanded
Mrs.
Bumble
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Certainly
,
my
dear
,
certainly
,
'
rejoined
Mr.
Bumble
,
making
a
quicker
*NL*
motion
towards
the
door
.
'
I
did
n't
intend
to
--
I
'm
going
,
my
dear
!
You
*NL*
are
so
very
violent
,
that
really
I
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
instant
,
Mrs.
Bumble
stepped
hastily
forward
to
replace
the
*NL*
carpet
,
which
had
been
kicked
up
in
the
scuffle
.
Mr.
Bumble
*NL*
immediately
darted
out
of
the
room
,
without
bestowing
another
thought
*NL*
on
his
unfinished
sentence
:
leaving
the
late
Mrs.
Corney
in
full
*NL*
possession
of
the
field
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bumble
was
fairly
taken
by
surprise
,
and
fairly
beaten
.
He
had
a
*NL*
decided
propensity
for
bullying
:
derived
no
inconsiderable
pleasure
*NL*
from
the
exercise
of
petty
cruelty
;
and
,
consequently
,
was
-LRB-
it
is
*NL*
needless
to
say
-RRB-
a
coward
.
This
is
by
no
means
a
disparagement
to
his
*NL*
character
;
for
many
official
personages
,
who
are
held
in
high
respect
*NL*
and
admiration
,
are
the
victims
of
similar
infirmities
.
The
remark
is
*NL*
made
,
indeed
,
rather
in
his
favour
than
otherwise
,
and
with
a
view
of
*NL*
impressing
the
reader
with
a
just
sense
of
his
qualifications
for
*NL*
office
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
the
measure
of
his
degradation
was
not
yet
full
.
After
making
a
*NL*
tour
of
the
house
,
and
thinking
,
for
the
first
time
,
that
the
poor-laws
*NL*
really
were
too
hard
on
people
;
and
that
men
who
ran
away
from
their
*NL*
wives
,
leaving
them
chargeable
to
the
parish
,
ought
,
in
justice
to
be
*NL*
visited
with
no
punishment
at
all
,
but
rather
rewarded
as
meritorious
*NL*
individuals
who
had
suffered
much
;
Mr.
Bumble
came
to
a
room
where
some
*NL*
of
the
female
paupers
were
usually
employed
in
washing
the
parish
*NL*
linen
:
when
the
sound
of
voices
in
conversation
,
now
proceeded
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Hem
!
'
said
Mr.
Bumble
,
summoning
up
all
his
native
dignity
.
`
These
*NL*
women
at
least
shall
continue
to
respect
the
prerogative
.
Hallo
!
hallo
*NL*
there
!
What
do
you
mean
by
this
noise
,
you
hussies
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
With
these
words
,
Mr.
Bumble
opened
the
door
,
and
walked
in
with
a
very
*NL*
fierce
and
angry
manner
:
which
was
at
once
exchanged
for
a
most
*NL*
humiliated
and
cowering
air
,
as
his
eyes
unexpectedly
rested
on
the
*NL*
form
of
his
lady
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
My
dear
,
'
said
Mr.
Bumble
,
'
I
did
n't
know
you
were
here
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Did
n't
know
I
was
here
!
'
repeated
Mrs.
Bumble
.
`
What
do
_
you
_
do
*NL*
here
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
thought
they
were
talking
rather
too
much
to
be
doing
their
work
*NL*
properly
,
my
dear
,
'
replied
Mr.
Bumble
:
glancing
distractedly
at
a
*NL*
couple
of
old
women
at
the
wash-tub
,
who
were
comparing
notes
of
*NL*
admiration
at
the
workhouse-master
's
humility
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
_
You
_
thought
they
were
talking
too
much
?
'
said
Mrs.
Bumble
.
`
What
*NL*
business
is
it
of
yours
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
my
dear
--
'
urged
Mr.
Bumble
submissively
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
business
is
it
of
yours
?
'
demanded
Mrs.
Bumble
,
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
's
very
true
,
you
're
matron
here
,
my
dear
,
'
submitted
Mr.
Bumble
;
*NL*
`
but
I
thought
you
might
n't
be
in
the
way
just
then
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
'll
tell
you
what
,
Mr.
Bumble
,
'
returned
his
lady
.
`
We
do
n't
want
*NL*
any
of
your
interference
.
You
're
a
great
deal
too
fond
of
poking
your
*NL*
nose
into
things
that
do
n't
concern
you
,
making
everybody
in
the
house
*NL*
laugh
,
the
moment
your
back
is
turned
,
and
making
yourself
look
like
a
*NL*
fool
every
hour
in
the
day
.
Be
off
;
come
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bumble
,
seeing
with
excruciating
feelings
,
the
delight
of
the
two
*NL*
old
paupers
,
who
were
tittering
together
most
rapturously
,
hesitated
*NL*
for
an
instant
.
Mrs.
Bumble
,
whose
patience
brooked
no
delay
,
caught
*NL*
up
a
bowl
of
soap-suds
,
and
motioning
him
towards
the
door
,
ordered
him
*NL*
instantly
to
depart
,
on
pain
of
receiving
the
contents
upon
his
portly
*NL*
person
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
could
Mr.
Bumble
do
?
He
looked
dejectedly
round
,
and
slunk
away
;
*NL*
and
,
as
he
reached
the
door
,
the
titterings
of
the
paupers
broke
into
a
*NL*
shrill
chuckle
of
irrepressible
delight
.
It
wanted
but
this
.
He
was
*NL*
degraded
in
their
eyes
;
he
had
lost
caste
and
station
before
the
very
*NL*
paupers
;
he
had
fallen
from
all
the
height
and
pomp
of
beadleship
,
to
*NL*
the
lowest
depth
of
the
most
snubbed
hen-peckery
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
All
in
two
months
!
'
said
Mr.
Bumble
,
filled
with
dismal
thoughts
.
*NL*
`
Two
months
!
No
more
than
two
months
ago
,
I
was
not
only
my
own
*NL*
master
,
but
everybody
else
's
,
so
far
as
the
porochial
workhouse
was
*NL*
concerned
,
and
now
!
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
too
much
.
Mr.
Bumble
boxed
the
ears
of
the
boy
who
opened
the
*NL*
gate
for
him
-LRB-
for
he
had
reached
the
portal
in
his
reverie
-RRB-
;
and
*NL*
walked
,
distractedly
,
into
the
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
walked
up
one
street
,
and
down
another
,
until
exercise
had
abated
*NL*
the
first
passion
of
his
grief
;
and
then
the
revulsion
of
feeling
made
*NL*
him
thirsty
.
He
passed
a
great
many
public-houses
;
but
,
at
length
*NL*
paused
before
one
in
a
by-way
,
whose
parlour
,
as
he
gathered
from
a
*NL*
hasty
peep
over
the
blinds
,
was
deserted
,
save
by
one
solitary
*NL*
customer
.
It
began
to
rain
,
heavily
,
at
the
moment
.
This
determined
*NL*
him
.
Mr.
Bumble
stepped
in
;
and
ordering
something
to
drink
,
as
he
*NL*
passed
the
bar
,
entered
the
apartment
into
which
he
had
looked
from
the
*NL*
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
who
was
seated
there
,
was
tall
and
dark
,
and
wore
a
large
*NL*
cloak
.
He
had
the
air
of
a
stranger
;
and
seemed
,
by
a
certain
*NL*
haggardness
in
his
look
,
as
well
as
by
the
dusty
soils
on
his
dress
,
to
*NL*
have
travelled
some
distance
.
He
eyed
Bumble
askance
,
as
he
entered
,
*NL*
but
scarcely
deigned
to
nod
his
head
in
acknowledgment
of
his
*NL*
salutation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bumble
had
quite
dignity
enough
for
two
;
supposing
even
that
the
*NL*
stranger
had
been
more
familiar
:
so
he
drank
his
gin-and-water
in
*NL*
silence
,
and
read
the
paper
with
great
show
of
pomp
and
circumstance
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
so
happened
,
however
:
as
it
will
happen
very
often
,
when
men
fall
*NL*
into
company
under
such
circumstances
:
that
Mr.
Bumble
felt
,
every
now
*NL*
and
then
,
a
powerful
inducement
,
which
he
could
not
resist
,
to
steal
a
*NL*
look
at
the
stranger
:
and
that
whenever
he
did
so
,
he
withdrew
his
*NL*
eyes
,
in
some
confusion
,
to
find
that
the
stranger
was
at
that
moment
*NL*
stealing
a
look
at
him
.
Mr.
Bumble
's
awkwardness
was
enhanced
by
the
*NL*
very
remarkable
expression
of
the
stranger
's
eye
,
which
was
keen
and
*NL*
bright
,
but
shadowed
by
a
scowl
of
distrust
and
suspicion
,
unlike
*NL*
anything
he
had
ever
observed
before
,
and
repulsive
to
behold
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
had
encountered
each
other
's
glance
several
times
in
this
*NL*
way
,
the
stranger
,
in
a
harsh
,
deep
voice
,
broke
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Were
you
looking
for
me
,
'
he
said
,
`
when
you
peered
in
at
the
window
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Not
that
I
am
aware
of
,
unless
you
're
Mr.
--
'
Here
Mr.
Bumble
stopped
*NL*
short
;
for
he
was
curious
to
know
the
stranger
's
name
,
and
thought
in
*NL*
his
impatience
,
he
might
supply
the
blank
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
see
you
were
not
,
'
said
the
stranger
;
an
expression
of
quiet
sarcasm
*NL*
playing
about
his
mouth
;
`
or
you
have
known
my
name
.
You
do
n't
know
*NL*
it
.
I
would
recommend
you
not
to
ask
for
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
meant
no
harm
,
young
man
,
'
observed
Mr.
Bumble
,
majestically
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
have
done
none
,
'
said
the
stranger
.
*NL*
*NL*
Another
silence
succeeded
this
short
dialogue
:
which
was
again
broken
*NL*
by
the
stranger
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
have
seen
you
before
,
I
think
?
'
said
he
.
`
You
were
differently
*NL*
dressed
at
that
time
,
and
I
only
passed
you
in
the
street
,
but
I
should
*NL*
know
you
again
.
You
were
beadle
here
,
once
;
were
you
not
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
was
,
'
said
Mr.
Bumble
,
in
some
surprise
;
`
porochial
beadle
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Just
so
,
'
rejoined
the
other
,
nodding
his
head
.
`
It
was
in
that
*NL*
character
I
saw
you
.
What
are
you
now
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Master
of
the
workhouse
,
'
rejoined
Mr.
Bumble
,
slowly
and
*NL*
impressively
,
to
check
any
undue
familiarity
the
stranger
might
*NL*
otherwise
assume
.
`
Master
of
the
workhouse
,
young
man
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
have
the
same
eye
to
your
own
interest
,
that
you
always
had
,
I
*NL*
doubt
not
?
'
resumed
the
stranger
,
looking
keenly
into
Mr.
Bumble
's
*NL*
eyes
,
as
he
raised
them
in
astonishment
at
the
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Do
n't
scruple
to
answer
freely
,
man
.
I
know
you
pretty
well
,
you
see
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
suppose
,
a
married
man
,
'
replied
Mr.
Bumble
,
shading
his
eyes
with
*NL*
his
hand
,
and
surveying
the
stranger
,
from
head
to
foot
,
in
evident
*NL*
perplexity
,
`
is
not
more
averse
to
turning
an
honest
penny
when
he
can
,
*NL*
than
a
single
one
.
Porochial
officers
are
not
so
well
paid
that
they
*NL*
can
afford
to
refuse
any
little
extra
fee
,
when
it
comes
to
them
in
a
*NL*
civil
and
proper
manner
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
stranger
smiled
,
and
nodded
his
head
again
:
as
much
to
say
,
he
had
*NL*
not
mistaken
his
man
;
then
rang
the
bell
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Fill
this
glass
again
,
'
he
said
,
handing
Mr.
Bumble
's
empty
tumbler
to
*NL*
the
landlord
.
`
Let
it
be
strong
and
hot
.
You
like
it
so
,
I
suppose
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Not
too
strong
,
'
replied
Mr.
Bumble
,
with
a
delicate
cough
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
understand
what
that
means
,
landlord
!
'
said
the
stranger
,
drily
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
host
smiled
,
disappeared
,
and
shortly
afterwards
returned
with
a
*NL*
steaming
jorum
:
of
which
,
the
first
gulp
brought
the
water
into
Mr.
*NL*
Bumble
's
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Now
listen
to
me
,
'
said
the
stranger
,
after
closing
the
door
and
*NL*
window
.
'
I
came
down
to
this
place
,
to-day
,
to
find
you
out
;
and
,
by
*NL*
one
of
those
chances
which
the
devil
throws
in
the
way
of
his
friends
*NL*
sometimes
,
you
walked
into
the
very
room
I
was
sitting
in
,
while
you
*NL*
were
uppermost
in
my
mind
.
I
want
some
information
from
you
.
I
do
n't
*NL*
ask
you
to
give
it
for
nothing
,
slight
as
it
is
.
Put
up
that
,
to
begin
*NL*
with
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
spoke
,
he
pushed
a
couple
of
sovereigns
across
the
table
to
his
*NL*
companion
,
carefully
,
as
though
unwilling
that
the
chinking
of
money
*NL*
should
be
heard
without
.
When
Mr.
Bumble
had
scrupulously
examined
the
*NL*
coins
,
to
see
that
they
were
genuine
,
and
had
put
them
up
,
with
much
*NL*
satisfaction
,
in
his
waistcoat-pocket
,
he
went
on
:
*NL*
*NL*
`
Carry
your
memory
back
--
let
me
see
--
twelve
years
,
last
winter
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
's
a
long
time
,
'
said
Mr.
Bumble
.
`
Very
good
.
I
've
done
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
scene
,
the
workhouse
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Good
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
the
time
,
night
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
the
place
,
the
crazy
hole
,
wherever
it
was
,
in
which
miserable
*NL*
drabs
brought
forth
the
life
and
health
so
often
denied
to
*NL*
themselves
--
gave
birth
to
puling
children
for
the
parish
to
rear
;
and
*NL*
hid
their
shame
,
rot
'em
in
the
grave
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
lying-in
room
,
I
suppose
?
'
said
Mr.
Bumble
,
not
quite
following
*NL*
the
stranger
's
excited
description
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
'
said
the
stranger
.
'
A
boy
was
born
there
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
A
many
boys
,
'
observed
Mr.
Bumble
,
shaking
his
head
,
despondingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
A
murrain
on
the
young
devils
!
'
cried
the
stranger
;
'
I
speak
of
one
;
a
*NL*
meek-looking
,
pale-faced
boy
,
who
was
apprenticed
down
here
,
to
a
*NL*
coffin-maker
--
I
wish
he
had
made
his
coffin
,
and
screwed
his
body
in
*NL*
it
--
and
who
afterwards
ran
away
to
London
,
as
it
was
supposed
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
you
mean
Oliver
!
Young
Twist
!
'
said
Mr.
Bumble
;
'
I
remember
him
,
*NL*
of
course
.
There
was
n't
a
obstinater
young
rascal
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
's
not
of
him
I
want
to
hear
;
I
've
heard
enough
of
him
,
'
said
the
*NL*
stranger
,
stopping
Mr.
Bumble
in
the
outset
of
a
tirade
on
the
subject
*NL*
of
poor
Oliver
's
vices
.
`
It
's
of
a
woman
;
the
hag
that
nursed
his
*NL*
mother
.
Where
is
she
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Where
is
she
?
'
said
Mr.
Bumble
,
whom
the
gin-and-water
had
rendered
*NL*
facetious
.
`
It
would
be
hard
to
tell
.
There
's
no
midwifery
there
,
*NL*
whichever
place
she
's
gone
to
;
so
I
suppose
she
's
out
of
employment
,
*NL*
anyway
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
do
you
mean
?
'
demanded
the
stranger
,
sternly
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
she
died
last
winter
,
'
rejoined
Mr.
Bumble
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
looked
fixedly
at
him
when
he
had
given
this
information
,
and
*NL*
although
he
did
not
withdraw
his
eyes
for
some
time
afterwards
,
his
*NL*
gaze
gradually
became
vacant
and
abstracted
,
and
he
seemed
lost
in
*NL*
thought
.
For
some
time
,
he
appeared
doubtful
whether
he
ought
to
be
*NL*
relieved
or
disappointed
by
the
intelligence
;
but
at
length
he
breathed
*NL*
more
freely
;
and
withdrawing
his
eyes
,
observed
that
it
was
no
great
*NL*
matter
.
With
that
he
rose
,
as
if
to
depart
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Mr.
Bumble
was
cunning
enough
;
and
he
at
once
saw
that
an
*NL*
opportunity
was
opened
,
for
the
lucrative
disposal
of
some
secret
in
*NL*
the
possession
of
his
better
half
.
He
well
remembered
the
night
of
old
*NL*
Sally
's
death
,
which
the
occurrences
of
that
day
had
given
him
good
*NL*
reason
to
recollect
,
as
the
occasion
on
which
he
had
proposed
to
Mrs.
*NL*
Corney
;
and
although
that
lady
had
never
confided
to
him
the
disclosure
*NL*
of
which
she
had
been
the
solitary
witness
,
he
had
heard
enough
to
know
*NL*
that
it
related
to
something
that
had
occurred
in
the
old
woman
's
*NL*
attendance
,
as
workhouse
nurse
,
upon
the
young
mother
of
Oliver
Twist
.
*NL*
Hastily
calling
this
circumstance
to
mind
,
he
informed
the
stranger
,
*NL*
with
an
air
of
mystery
,
that
one
woman
had
been
closeted
with
the
old
*NL*
harridan
shortly
before
she
died
;
and
that
she
could
,
as
he
had
reason
*NL*
to
believe
,
throw
some
light
on
the
subject
of
his
inquiry
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
How
can
I
find
her
?
'
said
the
stranger
,
thrown
off
his
guard
;
and
*NL*
plainly
showing
that
all
his
fears
-LRB-
whatever
they
were
-RRB-
were
aroused
*NL*
afresh
by
the
intelligence
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Only
through
me
,
'
rejoined
Mr.
Bumble
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
When
?
'
cried
the
stranger
,
hastily
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
To-morrow
,
'
rejoined
Bumble
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
At
nine
in
the
evening
,
'
said
the
stranger
,
producing
a
scrap
of
*NL*
paper
,
and
writing
down
upon
it
,
an
obscure
address
by
the
water-side
,
*NL*
in
characters
that
betrayed
his
agitation
;
`
at
nine
in
the
evening
,
*NL*
bring
her
to
me
there
.
I
need
n't
tell
you
to
be
secret
.
It
's
your
*NL*
interest
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
With
these
words
,
he
led
the
way
to
the
door
,
after
stopping
to
pay
for
*NL*
the
liquor
that
had
been
drunk
.
Shortly
remarking
that
their
roads
*NL*
were
different
,
he
departed
,
without
more
ceremony
than
an
emphatic
*NL*
repetition
of
the
hour
of
appointment
for
the
following
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
glancing
at
the
address
,
the
parochial
functionary
observed
that
it
*NL*
contained
no
name
.
The
stranger
had
not
gone
far
,
so
he
made
after
him
*NL*
to
ask
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
do
you
want
?
'
cried
the
man
,
turning
quickly
round
,
as
Bumble
*NL*
touched
him
on
the
arm
.
`
Following
me
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Only
to
ask
a
question
,
'
said
the
other
,
pointing
to
the
scrap
of
*NL*
paper
.
`
What
name
am
I
to
ask
for
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Monks
!
'
rejoined
the
man
;
and
strode
hastily
,
away
.

CHAPTER
XXXVIII
*NL*
*NL*
CONTAINING
AN
ACCOUNT
OF
WHAT
PASSED
BETWEEN
MR.
AND
MRS.
BUMBLE
,
AND
*NL*
MR.
MONKS
,
AT
THEIR
NOCTURNAL
INTERVIEW
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
dull
,
close
,
overcast
summer
evening
.
The
clouds
,
which
had
*NL*
been
threatening
all
day
,
spread
out
in
a
dense
and
sluggish
mass
of
*NL*
vapour
,
already
yielded
large
drops
of
rain
,
and
seemed
to
presage
a
*NL*
violent
thunder-storm
,
when
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Bumble
,
turning
out
of
the
*NL*
main
street
of
the
town
,
directed
their
course
towards
a
scattered
*NL*
little
colony
of
ruinous
houses
,
distant
from
it
some
mile
and
a-half
,
*NL*
or
thereabouts
,
and
erected
on
a
low
unwholesome
swamp
,
bordering
upon
*NL*
the
river
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
both
wrapped
in
old
and
shabby
outer
garments
,
which
might
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
serve
the
double
purpose
of
protecting
their
persons
from
the
*NL*
rain
,
and
sheltering
them
from
observation
.
The
husband
carried
a
*NL*
lantern
,
from
which
,
however
,
no
light
yet
shone
;
and
trudged
on
,
a
few
*NL*
paces
in
front
,
as
though
--
the
way
being
dirty
--
to
give
his
wife
the
*NL*
benefit
of
treading
in
his
heavy
footprints
.
They
went
on
,
in
profound
*NL*
silence
;
every
now
and
then
,
Mr.
Bumble
relaxed
his
pace
,
and
turned
*NL*
his
head
as
if
to
make
sure
that
his
helpmate
was
following
;
then
,
*NL*
discovering
that
she
was
close
at
his
heels
,
he
mended
his
rate
of
*NL*
walking
,
and
proceeded
,
at
a
considerable
increase
of
speed
,
towards
*NL*
their
place
of
destination
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
far
from
being
a
place
of
doubtful
character
;
for
it
had
long
*NL*
been
known
as
the
residence
of
none
but
low
ruffians
,
who
,
under
*NL*
various
pretences
of
living
by
their
labour
,
subsisted
chiefly
on
*NL*
plunder
and
crime
.
It
was
a
collection
of
mere
hovels
:
some
,
hastily
*NL*
built
with
loose
bricks
:
others
,
of
old
worm-eaten
ship-timber
:
jumbled
*NL*
together
without
any
attempt
at
order
or
arrangement
,
and
planted
,
for
*NL*
the
most
part
,
within
a
few
feet
of
the
river
's
bank
.
A
few
leaky
*NL*
boats
drawn
up
on
the
mud
,
and
made
fast
to
the
dwarf
wall
which
*NL*
skirted
it
:
and
here
and
there
an
oar
or
coil
of
rope
:
appeared
,
at
*NL*
first
,
to
indicate
that
the
inhabitants
of
these
miserable
cottages
*NL*
pursued
some
avocation
on
the
river
;
but
a
glance
at
the
shattered
and
*NL*
useless
condition
of
the
articles
thus
displayed
,
would
have
led
a
*NL*
passer-by
,
without
much
difficulty
,
to
the
conjecture
that
they
were
*NL*
disposed
there
,
rather
for
the
preservation
of
appearances
,
than
with
*NL*
any
view
to
their
being
actually
employed
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
heart
of
this
cluster
of
huts
;
and
skirting
the
river
,
which
its
*NL*
upper
stories
overhung
;
stood
a
large
building
,
formerly
used
as
a
*NL*
manufactory
of
some
kind
.
It
had
,
in
its
day
,
probably
furnished
*NL*
employment
to
the
inhabitants
of
the
surrounding
tenements
.
But
it
had
*NL*
long
since
gone
to
ruin
.
The
rat
,
the
worm
,
and
the
action
of
the
*NL*
damp
,
had
weakened
and
rotted
the
piles
on
which
it
stood
;
and
a
*NL*
considerable
portion
of
the
building
had
already
sunk
down
into
the
*NL*
water
;
while
the
remainder
,
tottering
and
bending
over
the
dark
stream
,
*NL*
seemed
to
wait
a
favourable
opportunity
of
following
its
old
companion
,
*NL*
and
involving
itself
in
the
same
fate
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
before
this
ruinous
building
that
the
worthy
couple
paused
,
as
*NL*
the
first
peal
of
distant
thunder
reverberated
in
the
air
,
and
the
rain
*NL*
commenced
pouring
violently
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
place
should
be
somewhere
here
,
'
said
Bumble
,
consulting
a
scrap
*NL*
of
paper
he
held
in
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Halloa
there
!
'
cried
a
voice
from
above
.
*NL*
*NL*
Following
the
sound
,
Mr.
Bumble
raised
his
head
and
descried
a
man
*NL*
looking
out
of
a
door
,
breast-high
,
on
the
second
story
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Stand
still
,
a
minute
,
'
cried
the
voice
;
`
I
'll
be
with
you
directly
.
'
*NL*
With
which
the
head
disappeared
,
and
the
door
closed
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Is
that
the
man
?
'
asked
Mr.
Bumble
's
good
lady
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bumble
nodded
in
the
affirmative
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Then
,
mind
what
I
told
you
,
'
said
the
matron
:
`
and
be
careful
to
say
*NL*
as
little
as
you
can
,
or
you
'll
betray
us
at
once
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bumble
,
who
had
eyed
the
building
with
very
rueful
looks
,
was
*NL*
apparently
about
to
express
some
doubts
relative
to
the
advisability
of
*NL*
proceeding
any
further
with
the
enterprise
just
then
,
when
he
was
*NL*
prevented
by
the
appearance
of
Monks
:
who
opened
a
small
door
,
near
*NL*
which
they
stood
,
and
beckoned
them
inwards
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Come
in
!
'
he
cried
impatiently
,
stamping
his
foot
upon
the
ground
.
*NL*
`
Do
n't
keep
me
here
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
woman
,
who
had
hesitated
at
first
,
walked
boldly
in
,
without
any
*NL*
other
invitation
.
Mr.
Bumble
,
who
was
ashamed
or
afraid
to
lag
behind
,
*NL*
followed
:
obviously
very
ill
at
ease
and
with
scarcely
any
of
that
*NL*
remarkable
dignity
which
was
usually
his
chief
characteristic
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
the
devil
made
you
stand
lingering
there
,
in
the
wet
?
'
said
*NL*
Monks
,
turning
round
,
and
addressing
Bumble
,
after
he
had
bolted
the
*NL*
door
behind
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
We
--
we
were
only
cooling
ourselves
,
'
stammered
Bumble
,
looking
*NL*
apprehensively
about
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Cooling
yourselves
!
'
retorted
Monks
.
`
Not
all
the
rain
that
ever
*NL*
fell
,
or
ever
will
fall
,
will
put
as
much
of
hell
's
fire
out
,
as
a
man
*NL*
can
carry
about
with
him
.
You
wo
n't
cool
yourself
so
easily
;
do
n't
*NL*
think
it
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
With
this
agreeable
speech
,
Monks
turned
short
upon
the
matron
,
and
*NL*
bent
his
gaze
upon
her
,
till
even
she
,
who
was
not
easily
cowed
,
was
*NL*
fain
to
withdraw
her
eyes
,
and
turn
them
towards
the
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
This
is
the
woman
,
is
it
?
'
demanded
Monks
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Hem
!
That
is
the
woman
,
'
replied
Mr.
Bumble
,
mindful
of
his
wife
's
*NL*
caution
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
think
women
never
can
keep
secrets
,
I
suppose
?
'
said
the
matron
,
*NL*
interposing
,
and
returning
,
as
she
spoke
,
the
searching
look
of
Monks
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
know
they
will
always
keep
_
one
_
till
it
's
found
out
,
'
said
Monks
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
what
may
that
be
?
'
asked
the
matron
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
loss
of
their
own
good
name
,
'
replied
Monks
.
`
So
,
by
the
same
*NL*
rule
,
if
a
woman
's
a
party
to
a
secret
that
might
hang
or
transport
*NL*
her
,
I
'm
not
afraid
of
her
telling
it
to
anybody
;
not
I
!
Do
you
*NL*
understand
,
mistress
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
'
rejoined
the
matron
,
slightly
colouring
as
she
spoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Of
course
you
do
n't
!
'
said
Monks
.
`
How
should
you
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
Bestowing
something
half-way
between
a
smile
and
a
frown
upon
his
two
*NL*
companions
,
and
again
beckoning
them
to
follow
him
,
the
man
hastened
*NL*
across
the
apartment
,
which
was
of
considerable
extent
,
but
low
in
the
*NL*
roof
.
He
was
preparing
to
ascend
a
steep
staircase
,
or
rather
ladder
,
*NL*
leading
to
another
floor
of
warehouses
above
:
when
a
bright
flash
of
*NL*
lightning
streamed
down
the
aperture
,
and
a
peal
of
thunder
followed
,
*NL*
which
shook
the
crazy
building
to
its
centre
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Hear
it
!
'
he
cried
,
shrinking
back
.
`
Hear
it
!
Rolling
and
crashing
*NL*
on
as
if
it
echoed
through
a
thousand
caverns
where
the
devils
were
*NL*
hiding
from
it
.
I
hate
the
sound
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
remained
silent
for
a
few
moments
;
and
then
,
removing
his
hands
*NL*
suddenly
from
his
face
,
showed
,
to
the
unspeakable
discomposure
of
Mr.
*NL*
Bumble
,
that
it
was
much
distorted
and
discoloured
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
These
fits
come
over
me
,
now
and
then
,
'
said
Monks
,
observing
his
*NL*
alarm
;
`
and
thunder
sometimes
brings
them
on
.
Do
n't
mind
me
now
;
it
's
*NL*
all
over
for
this
once
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
speaking
,
he
led
the
way
up
the
ladder
;
and
hastily
closing
the
*NL*
window-shutter
of
the
room
into
which
it
led
,
lowered
a
lantern
which
*NL*
hung
at
the
end
of
a
rope
and
pulley
passed
through
one
of
the
heavy
*NL*
beams
in
the
ceiling
:
and
which
cast
a
dim
light
upon
an
old
table
and
*NL*
three
chairs
that
were
placed
beneath
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Now
,
'
said
Monks
,
when
they
had
all
three
seated
themselves
,
`
the
*NL*
sooner
we
come
to
our
business
,
the
better
for
all
.
The
woman
know
*NL*
what
it
is
,
does
she
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
question
was
addressed
to
Bumble
;
but
his
wife
anticipated
the
*NL*
reply
,
by
intimating
that
she
was
perfectly
acquainted
with
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
is
right
in
saying
that
you
were
with
this
hag
the
night
she
died
;
*NL*
and
that
she
told
you
something
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
About
the
mother
of
the
boy
you
named
,
'
replied
the
matron
*NL*
interrupting
him
.
`
Yes
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
first
question
is
,
of
what
nature
was
her
communication
?
'
said
*NL*
Monks
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
's
the
second
,
'
observed
the
woman
with
much
deliberation
.
`
The
*NL*
first
is
,
what
may
the
communication
be
worth
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Who
the
devil
can
tell
that
,
without
knowing
of
what
kind
it
is
?
'
*NL*
asked
Monks
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Nobody
better
than
you
,
I
am
persuaded
,
'
answered
Mrs.
Bumble
:
who
did
*NL*
not
want
for
spirit
,
as
her
yoke-fellow
could
abundantly
testify
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Humph
!
'
said
Monks
significantly
,
and
with
a
look
of
eager
inquiry
;
*NL*
`
there
may
be
money
's
worth
to
get
,
eh
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Perhaps
there
may
,
'
was
the
composed
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Something
that
was
taken
from
her
,
'
said
Monks
.
`
Something
that
she
*NL*
wore
.
Something
that
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
had
better
bid
,
'
interrupted
Mrs.
Bumble
.
'
I
have
heard
enough
,
*NL*
already
,
to
assure
me
that
you
are
the
man
I
ought
to
talk
to
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bumble
,
who
had
not
yet
been
admitted
by
his
better
half
into
any
*NL*
greater
share
of
the
secret
than
he
had
originally
possessed
,
listened
*NL*
to
this
dialogue
with
outstretched
neck
and
distended
eyes
:
which
he
*NL*
directed
towards
his
wife
and
Monks
,
by
turns
,
in
undisguised
*NL*
astonishment
;
increased
,
if
possible
,
when
the
latter
sternly
demanded
,
*NL*
what
sum
was
required
for
the
disclosure
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
's
it
worth
to
you
?
'
asked
the
woman
,
as
collectedly
as
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
may
be
nothing
;
it
may
be
twenty
pounds
,
'
replied
Monks
.
`
Speak
*NL*
out
,
and
let
me
know
which
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Add
five
pounds
to
the
sum
you
have
named
;
give
me
five-and-twenty
*NL*
pounds
in
gold
,
'
said
the
woman
;
`
and
I
'll
tell
you
all
I
know
.
Not
*NL*
before
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Five-and-twenty
pounds
!
'
exclaimed
Monks
,
drawing
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
spoke
as
plainly
as
I
could
,
'
replied
Mrs.
Bumble
.
`
It
's
not
a
*NL*
large
sum
,
either
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Not
a
large
sum
for
a
paltry
secret
,
that
may
be
nothing
when
it
's
*NL*
told
!
'
cried
Monks
impatiently
;
`
and
which
has
been
lying
dead
for
*NL*
twelve
years
past
or
more
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Such
matters
keep
well
,
and
,
like
good
wine
,
often
double
their
value
*NL*
in
course
of
time
,
'
answered
the
matron
,
still
preserving
the
resolute
*NL*
indifference
she
had
assumed
.
`
As
to
lying
dead
,
there
are
those
who
*NL*
will
lie
dead
for
twelve
thousand
years
to
come
,
or
twelve
million
,
for
*NL*
anything
you
or
I
know
,
who
will
tell
strange
tales
at
last
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
if
I
pay
it
for
nothing
?
'
asked
Monks
,
hesitating
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
can
easily
take
it
away
again
,
'
replied
the
matron
.
'
I
am
but
a
*NL*
woman
;
alone
here
;
and
unprotected
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Not
alone
,
my
dear
,
nor
unprotected
,
neither
,
'
submitted
Mr.
Bumble
,
*NL*
in
a
voice
tremulous
with
fear
:
'
_
I
_
am
here
,
my
dear
.
And
besides
,
'
*NL*
said
Mr.
Bumble
,
his
teeth
chattering
as
he
spoke
,
`
Mr.
Monks
is
too
*NL*
much
of
a
gentleman
to
attempt
any
violence
on
porochial
persons
.
Mr.
*NL*
Monks
is
aware
that
I
am
not
a
young
man
,
my
dear
,
and
also
that
I
am
a
*NL*
little
run
to
seed
,
as
I
may
say
;
bu
he
has
heerd
:
I
say
I
have
no
*NL*
doubt
Mr.
Monks
has
heerd
,
my
dear
:
that
I
am
a
very
determined
*NL*
officer
,
with
very
uncommon
strength
,
if
I
'm
once
roused
.
I
only
want
*NL*
a
little
rousing
;
that
's
all
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
As
Mr.
Bumble
spoke
,
he
made
a
melancholy
feint
of
grasping
his
lantern
*NL*
with
fierce
determination
;
and
plainly
showed
,
by
the
alarmed
*NL*
expression
of
every
feature
,
that
he
_
did
_
want
a
little
rousing
,
and
*NL*
not
a
little
,
prior
to
making
any
very
warlike
demonstration
:
unless
,
*NL*
indeed
,
against
paupers
,
or
other
person
or
persons
trained
down
for
*NL*
the
purpose
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
are
a
fool
,
'
said
Mrs.
Bumble
,
in
reply
;
`
and
had
better
hold
your
*NL*
tongue
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
had
better
have
cut
it
out
,
before
he
came
,
if
he
ca
n't
speak
in
a
*NL*
lower
tone
,
'
said
Monks
,
grimly
.
`
So
!
He
's
your
husband
,
eh
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
my
husband
!
'
tittered
the
matron
,
parrying
the
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
thought
as
much
,
when
you
came
in
,
'
rejoined
Monks
,
marking
the
*NL*
angry
glance
which
the
lady
darted
at
her
spouse
as
she
spoke
.
`
So
*NL*
much
the
better
;
I
have
less
hesitation
in
dealing
with
two
people
,
*NL*
when
I
find
that
there
's
only
one
will
between
them
.
I
'm
in
earnest
.
*NL*
See
here
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
thrust
his
hand
into
a
side-pocket
;
and
producing
a
canvas
bag
,
told
*NL*
out
twenty-five
sovereigns
on
the
table
,
and
pushed
them
over
to
the
*NL*
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Now
,
'
he
said
,
`
gather
them
up
;
and
when
this
cursed
peal
of
thunder
,
*NL*
which
I
feel
is
coming
up
to
break
over
the
house-top
,
is
gone
,
let
's
*NL*
hear
your
story
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
thunder
,
which
seemed
in
fact
much
nearer
,
and
to
shiver
and
break
*NL*
almost
over
their
heads
,
having
subsided
,
Monks
,
raising
his
face
from
*NL*
the
table
,
bent
forward
to
listen
to
what
the
woman
should
say
.
The
*NL*
faces
of
the
three
nearly
touched
,
as
the
two
men
leant
over
the
small
*NL*
table
in
their
eagerness
to
hear
,
and
the
woman
also
leant
forward
to
*NL*
render
her
whisper
audible
.
The
sickly
rays
of
the
suspended
lantern
*NL*
falling
directly
upon
them
,
aggravated
the
paleness
and
anxiety
of
*NL*
their
countenances
:
which
,
encircled
by
the
deepest
gloom
and
darkness
,
*NL*
looked
ghastly
in
the
extreme
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
When
this
woman
,
that
we
called
old
Sally
,
died
,
'
the
matron
began
,
*NL*
`
she
and
I
were
alone
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Was
there
no
one
by
?
'
asked
Monks
,
in
the
same
hollow
whisper
;
`
No
*NL*
sick
wretch
or
idiot
in
some
other
bed
?
No
one
who
could
hear
,
and
*NL*
might
,
by
possibility
,
understand
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Not
a
soul
,
'
replied
the
woman
;
`
we
were
alone
.
_
I
_
stood
alone
*NL*
beside
the
body
when
death
came
over
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Good
,
'
said
Monks
,
regarding
her
attentively
.
`
Go
on
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
She
spoke
of
a
young
creature
,
'
resumed
the
matron
,
`
who
had
brought
a
*NL*
child
into
the
world
some
years
before
;
not
merely
in
the
same
room
,
*NL*
but
in
the
same
bed
,
in
which
she
then
lay
dying
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ay
?
'
said
Monks
,
with
quivering
lip
,
and
glancing
over
his
shoulder
,
*NL*
`
Blood
!
How
things
come
about
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
child
was
the
one
you
named
to
him
last
night
,
'
said
the
matron
,
*NL*
nodding
carelessly
towards
her
husband
;
`
the
mother
this
nurse
had
*NL*
robbed
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
In
life
?
'
asked
Monks
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
In
death
,
'
replied
the
woman
,
with
something
like
a
shudder
.
`
She
*NL*
stole
from
the
corpse
,
when
it
had
hardly
turned
to
one
,
that
which
the
*NL*
dead
mother
had
prayed
her
,
with
her
last
breath
,
to
keep
for
the
*NL*
infant
's
sake
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
She
sold
it
,
'
cried
Monks
,
with
desperate
eagerness
;
`
did
she
sell
it
?
*NL*
Where
?
When
?
To
whom
?
How
long
before
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
As
she
told
me
,
with
great
difficulty
,
that
she
had
done
this
,
'
said
*NL*
the
matron
,
`
she
fell
back
and
died
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Without
saying
more
?
'
cried
Monks
,
in
a
voice
which
,
from
its
very
*NL*
suppression
,
seemed
only
the
more
furious
.
`
It
's
a
lie
!
I
'll
not
be
*NL*
played
with
.
She
said
more
.
I
'll
tear
the
life
out
of
you
both
,
but
*NL*
I
'll
know
what
it
was
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
She
did
n't
utter
another
word
,
'
said
the
woman
,
to
all
appearance
*NL*
unmoved
-LRB-
as
Mr.
Bumble
was
very
far
from
being
-RRB-
by
the
strange
man
's
*NL*
violence
;
`
but
she
clutched
my
gown
,
violently
,
with
one
hand
,
which
*NL*
was
partly
closed
;
and
when
I
saw
that
she
was
dead
,
and
so
removed
the
*NL*
hand
by
force
,
I
found
it
clasped
a
scrap
of
dirty
paper
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Which
contained
--
'
interposed
Monks
,
stretching
forward
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Nothing
,
'
replied
the
woman
;
`
it
was
a
pawnbroker
's
duplicate
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
For
what
?
'
demanded
Monks
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
In
good
time
I
'll
tell
you
.
'
said
the
woman
.
'
I
judge
that
she
had
*NL*
kept
the
trinket
,
for
some
time
,
in
the
hope
of
turning
it
to
better
*NL*
account
;
and
then
had
pawned
it
;
and
had
saved
or
scraped
together
*NL*
money
to
pay
the
pawnbroker
's
interest
year
by
year
,
and
prevent
its
*NL*
running
out
;
so
that
if
anything
came
of
it
,
it
could
still
be
*NL*
redeemed
.
Nothing
had
come
of
it
;
and
,
as
I
tell
you
,
she
died
with
*NL*
the
scrap
of
paper
,
all
worn
and
tattered
,
in
her
hand
.
The
time
was
*NL*
out
in
two
days
;
I
thought
something
might
one
day
come
of
it
too
;
and
*NL*
so
redeemed
the
pledge
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Where
is
it
now
?
'
asked
Monks
quickly
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
_
There
_
,
'
replied
the
woman
.
And
,
as
if
glad
to
be
relieved
of
it
,
*NL*
she
hastily
threw
upon
the
table
a
small
kid
bag
scarcely
large
enough
*NL*
for
a
French
watch
,
which
Monks
pouncing
upon
,
tore
open
with
trembling
*NL*
hands
.
It
contained
a
little
gold
locket
:
in
which
were
two
locks
of
*NL*
hair
,
and
a
plain
gold
wedding-ring
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
has
the
word
``
Agnes
''
engraved
on
the
inside
,
'
said
the
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
There
is
a
blank
left
for
the
surname
;
and
then
follows
the
date
;
*NL*
which
is
within
a
year
before
the
child
was
born
.
I
found
out
that
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
this
is
all
?
'
said
Monks
,
after
a
close
and
eager
scrutiny
of
the
*NL*
contents
of
the
little
packet
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
All
,
'
replied
the
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bumble
drew
a
long
breath
,
as
if
he
were
glad
to
find
that
the
*NL*
story
was
over
,
and
no
mention
made
of
taking
the
five-and-twenty
*NL*
pounds
back
again
;
and
now
he
took
courage
to
wipe
the
perspiration
*NL*
which
had
been
trickling
over
his
nose
,
unchecked
,
during
the
whole
of
*NL*
the
previous
dialogue
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
know
nothing
of
the
story
,
beyond
what
I
can
guess
at
,
'
said
his
*NL*
wife
addressing
Monks
,
after
a
short
silence
;
`
and
I
want
to
know
*NL*
nothing
;
for
it
's
safer
not
.
But
I
may
ask
you
two
questions
,
may
I
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
may
ask
,
'
said
Monks
,
with
some
show
of
surprise
;
`
but
whether
I
*NL*
answer
or
not
is
another
question
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
--
Which
makes
three
,
'
observed
Mr.
Bumble
,
essaying
a
stroke
of
*NL*
facetiousness
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Is
that
what
you
expected
to
get
from
me
?
'
demanded
the
matron
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
is
,
'
replied
Monks
.
`
The
other
question
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
do
you
propose
to
do
with
it
?
Can
it
be
used
against
me
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Never
,
'
rejoined
Monks
;
`
nor
against
me
either
.
See
here
!
But
do
n't
*NL*
move
a
step
forward
,
or
your
life
is
not
worth
a
bulrush
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
With
these
words
,
he
suddenly
wheeled
the
table
aside
,
and
pulling
an
*NL*
iron
ring
in
the
boarding
,
threw
back
a
large
trap-door
which
opened
*NL*
close
at
Mr.
Bumble
's
feet
,
and
caused
that
gentleman
to
retire
several
*NL*
paces
backward
,
with
great
precipitation
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Look
down
,
'
said
Monks
,
lowering
the
lantern
into
the
gulf
.
`
Do
n't
*NL*
fear
me
.
I
could
have
let
you
down
,
quietly
enough
,
when
you
were
*NL*
seated
over
it
,
if
that
had
been
my
game
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
encouraged
,
the
matron
drew
near
to
the
brink
;
and
even
Mr.
Bumble
*NL*
himself
,
impelled
by
curiousity
,
ventured
to
do
the
same
.
The
turbid
*NL*
water
,
swollen
by
the
heavy
rain
,
was
rushing
rapidly
on
below
;
and
all
*NL*
other
sounds
were
lost
in
the
noise
of
its
plashing
and
eddying
against
*NL*
the
green
and
slimy
piles
.
There
had
once
been
a
water-mill
beneath
;
*NL*
the
tide
foaming
and
chafing
round
the
few
rotten
stakes
,
and
fragments
*NL*
of
machinery
that
yet
remained
,
seemed
to
dart
onward
,
with
a
new
*NL*
impulse
,
when
freed
from
the
obstacles
which
had
unavailingly
attempted
*NL*
to
stem
its
headlong
course
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
If
you
flung
a
man
's
body
down
there
,
where
would
it
be
to-morrow
*NL*
morning
?
'
said
Monks
,
swinging
the
lantern
to
and
fro
in
the
dark
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Twelve
miles
down
the
river
,
and
cut
to
pieces
besides
,
'
replied
*NL*
Bumble
,
recoiling
at
the
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
Monks
drew
the
little
packet
from
his
breast
,
where
he
had
hurriedly
*NL*
thrust
it
;
and
tying
it
to
a
leaden
weight
,
which
had
formed
a
part
of
*NL*
some
pulley
,
and
was
lying
on
the
floor
,
dropped
it
into
the
stream
.
*NL*
It
fell
straight
,
and
true
as
a
die
;
clove
the
water
with
a
scarcely
*NL*
audible
splash
;
and
was
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
three
looking
into
each
other
's
faces
,
seemed
to
breathe
more
*NL*
freely
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
There
!
'
said
Monks
,
closing
the
trap-door
,
which
fell
heavily
back
*NL*
into
its
former
position
.
`
If
the
sea
ever
gives
up
its
dead
,
as
books
*NL*
say
it
will
,
it
will
keep
its
gold
and
silver
to
itself
,
and
that
trash
*NL*
among
it
.
We
have
nothing
more
to
say
,
and
may
break
up
our
pleasant
*NL*
party
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
By
all
means
,
'
observed
Mr.
Bumble
,
with
great
alacrity
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
'll
keep
a
quiet
tongue
in
your
head
,
will
you
?
'
said
Monks
,
with
a
*NL*
threatening
look
.
'
I
am
not
afraid
of
your
wife
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
may
depend
upon
me
,
young
man
,
'
answered
Mr.
Bumble
,
bowing
*NL*
himself
gradually
towards
the
ladder
,
with
excessive
politeness
.
`
On
*NL*
everybody
's
account
,
young
man
;
on
my
own
,
you
know
,
Mr.
Monks
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
am
glad
,
for
your
sake
,
to
hear
it
,
'
remarked
Monks
.
`
Light
your
*NL*
lantern
!
And
get
away
from
here
as
fast
as
you
can
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
fortunate
that
the
conversation
terminated
at
this
point
,
or
Mr.
*NL*
Bumble
,
who
had
bowed
himself
to
within
six
inches
of
the
ladder
,
would
*NL*
infallibly
have
pitched
headlong
into
the
room
below
.
He
lighted
his
*NL*
lantern
from
that
which
Monks
had
detached
from
the
rope
,
and
now
*NL*
carried
in
his
hand
;
and
making
no
effort
to
prolong
the
discourse
,
*NL*
descended
in
silence
,
followed
by
his
wife
.
Monks
brought
up
the
rear
,
*NL*
after
pausing
on
the
steps
to
satisfy
himself
that
there
were
no
other
*NL*
sounds
to
be
heard
than
the
beating
of
the
rain
without
,
and
the
*NL*
rushing
of
the
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
traversed
the
lower
room
,
slowly
,
and
with
caution
;
for
Monks
*NL*
started
at
every
shadow
;
and
Mr.
Bumble
,
holding
his
lantern
a
foot
*NL*
above
the
ground
,
walked
not
only
with
remarkable
care
,
but
with
a
*NL*
marvellously
light
step
for
a
gentleman
of
his
figure
:
looking
*NL*
nervously
about
him
for
hidden
trap-doors
.
The
gate
at
which
they
had
*NL*
entered
,
was
softly
unfastened
and
opened
by
Monks
;
merely
exchanging
a
*NL*
nod
with
their
mysterious
acquaintance
,
the
married
couple
emerged
into
*NL*
the
wet
and
darkness
outside
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
no
sooner
gone
,
than
Monks
,
who
appeared
to
entertain
an
*NL*
invincible
repugnance
to
being
left
alone
,
called
to
a
boy
who
had
been
*NL*
hidden
somewhere
below
.
Bidding
him
go
first
,
and
bear
the
light
,
he
*NL*
returned
to
the
chamber
he
had
just
quitted
.

CHAPTER
XXXIX
*NL*
*NL*
INTRODUCES
SOME
RESPECTABLE
CHARACTERS
WITH
WHOM
THE
READER
IS
ALREADY
*NL*
ACQUAINTED
,
AND
SHOWS
HOW
MONKS
AND
THE
JEW
LAID
THEIR
WORTHY
HEADS
*NL*
TOGETHER
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
evening
following
that
upon
which
the
three
worthies
mentioned
*NL*
in
the
last
chapter
,
disposed
of
their
little
matter
of
business
as
*NL*
therein
narrated
,
Mr.
William
Sikes
,
awakening
from
a
nap
,
drowsily
*NL*
growled
forth
an
inquiry
what
time
of
night
it
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
room
in
which
Mr.
Sikes
propounded
this
question
,
was
not
one
of
*NL*
those
he
had
tenanted
,
previous
to
the
Chertsey
expedition
,
although
it
*NL*
was
in
the
same
quarter
of
the
town
,
and
was
situated
at
no
great
*NL*
distance
from
his
former
lodgings
.
It
was
not
,
in
appearance
,
so
*NL*
desirable
a
habitation
as
his
old
quarters
:
being
a
mean
and
*NL*
badly-furnished
apartment
,
of
very
limited
size
;
lighted
only
by
one
*NL*
small
window
in
the
shelving
roof
,
and
abutting
on
a
close
and
dirty
*NL*
lane
.
Nor
were
there
wanting
other
indications
of
the
good
gentleman
's
*NL*
having
gone
down
in
the
world
of
late
:
for
a
great
scarcity
of
*NL*
furniture
,
and
total
absence
of
comfort
,
together
with
the
*NL*
disappearance
of
all
such
small
moveables
as
spare
clothes
and
linen
,
*NL*
bespoke
a
state
of
extreme
poverty
;
while
the
meagre
and
attenuated
*NL*
condition
of
Mr.
Sikes
himself
would
have
fully
confirmed
these
*NL*
symptoms
,
if
they
had
stood
in
any
need
of
corroboration
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
housebreaker
was
lying
on
the
bed
,
wrapped
in
his
white
great-coat
,
*NL*
by
way
of
dressing-gown
,
and
displaying
a
set
of
features
in
no
degree
*NL*
improved
by
the
cadaverous
hue
of
illness
,
and
the
addition
of
a
soiled
*NL*
nightcap
,
and
a
stiff
,
black
beard
of
a
week
's
growth
.
The
dog
sat
at
*NL*
the
bedside
:
now
eyeing
his
master
with
a
wistful
look
,
and
now
*NL*
pricking
his
ears
,
and
uttering
a
low
growl
as
some
noise
in
the
*NL*
street
,
or
in
the
lower
part
of
the
house
,
attracted
his
attention
.
*NL*
Seated
by
the
window
,
busily
engaged
in
patching
an
old
waistcoat
which
*NL*
formed
a
portion
of
the
robber
's
ordinary
dress
,
was
a
female
:
so
pale
*NL*
and
reduced
with
watching
and
privation
,
that
there
would
have
been
*NL*
considerable
difficulty
in
recognising
her
as
the
same
Nancy
who
has
*NL*
already
figured
in
this
tale
,
but
for
the
voice
in
which
she
replied
to
*NL*
Mr.
Sikes
's
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Not
long
gone
seven
,
'
said
the
girl
.
`
How
do
you
feel
to-night
,
Bill
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
As
weak
as
water
,
'
replied
Mr.
Sikes
,
with
an
imprecation
on
his
eyes
*NL*
and
limbs
.
`
Here
;
lend
us
a
hand
,
and
let
me
get
off
this
thundering
*NL*
bed
anyhow
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Illness
had
not
improved
Mr.
Sikes
's
temper
;
for
,
as
the
girl
raised
*NL*
him
up
and
led
him
to
a
chair
,
he
muttered
various
curses
on
her
*NL*
awkwardness
,
and
struck
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Whining
are
you
?
'
said
Sikes
.
`
Come
!
Do
n't
stand
snivelling
there
.
*NL*
If
you
ca
n't
do
anything
better
than
that
,
cut
off
altogether
.
D'ye
*NL*
hear
me
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
hear
you
,
'
replied
the
girl
,
turning
her
face
aside
,
and
forcing
a
*NL*
laugh
.
`
What
fancy
have
you
got
in
your
head
now
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
!
you
've
thought
better
of
it
,
have
you
?
'
growled
Sikes
,
marking
the
*NL*
tear
which
trembled
in
her
eye
.
`
All
the
better
for
you
,
you
have
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
you
do
n't
mean
to
say
,
you
'd
be
hard
upon
me
to-night
,
Bill
,
'
*NL*
said
the
girl
,
laying
her
hand
upon
his
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
!
'
cried
Mr.
Sikes
.
`
Why
not
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Such
a
number
of
nights
,
'
said
the
girl
,
with
a
touch
of
woman
's
*NL*
tenderness
,
which
communicated
something
like
sweetness
of
tone
,
even
*NL*
to
her
voice
:
`
such
a
number
of
nights
as
I
've
been
patient
with
you
,
*NL*
nursing
and
caring
for
you
,
as
if
you
had
been
a
child
:
and
this
the
*NL*
first
that
I
've
seen
you
like
yourself
;
you
would
n't
have
served
me
as
*NL*
you
did
just
now
,
if
you
'd
thought
of
that
,
would
you
?
Come
,
come
;
say
*NL*
you
would
n't
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
then
,
'
rejoined
Mr.
Sikes
,
'
I
would
n't
.
Why
,
damme
,
now
,
the
*NL*
girls
's
whining
again
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
's
nothing
,
'
said
the
girl
,
throwing
herself
into
a
chair
.
`
Do
n't
*NL*
you
seem
to
mind
me
.
It
'll
soon
be
over
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
'll
be
over
?
'
demanded
Mr.
Sikes
in
a
savage
voice
.
`
What
foolery
*NL*
are
you
up
to
,
now
,
again
?
Get
up
and
bustle
about
,
and
do
n't
come
*NL*
over
me
with
your
woman
's
nonsense
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
At
any
other
time
,
this
remonstrance
,
and
the
tone
in
which
it
was
*NL*
delivered
,
would
have
had
the
desired
effect
;
but
the
girl
being
really
*NL*
weak
and
exhausted
,
dropped
her
head
over
the
back
of
the
chair
,
and
*NL*
fainted
,
before
Mr.
Sikes
could
get
out
a
few
of
the
appropriate
oaths
*NL*
with
which
,
on
similar
occasions
,
he
was
accustomed
to
garnish
his
*NL*
threats
.
Not
knowing
,
very
well
,
what
to
do
,
in
this
uncommon
*NL*
emergency
;
for
Miss
Nancy
's
hysterics
were
usually
of
that
violent
kind
*NL*
which
the
patient
fights
and
struggles
out
of
,
without
much
assistance
;
*NL*
Mr.
Sikes
tried
a
little
blasphemy
:
and
finding
that
mode
of
treatment
*NL*
wholly
ineffectual
,
called
for
assistance
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
's
the
matter
here
,
my
dear
?
'
said
Fagin
,
looking
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Lend
a
hand
to
the
girl
,
ca
n't
you
?
'
replied
Sikes
impatiently
.
`
Do
n't
*NL*
stand
chattering
and
grinning
at
me
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
With
an
exclamation
of
surprise
,
Fagin
hastened
to
the
girl
's
*NL*
assistance
,
while
Mr.
John
Dawkins
-LRB-
otherwise
the
Artful
Dodger
-RRB-
,
who
*NL*
had
followed
his
venerable
friend
into
the
room
,
hastily
deposited
on
*NL*
the
floor
a
bundle
with
which
he
was
laden
;
and
snatching
a
bottle
from
*NL*
the
grasp
of
Master
Charles
Bates
who
came
close
at
his
heels
,
uncorked
*NL*
it
in
a
twinkling
with
his
teeth
,
and
poured
a
portion
of
its
contents
*NL*
down
the
patient
's
throat
:
previously
taking
a
taste
,
himself
,
to
*NL*
prevent
mistakes
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Give
her
a
whiff
of
fresh
air
with
the
bellows
,
Charley
,
'
said
Mr.
*NL*
Dawkins
;
`
and
you
slap
her
hands
,
Fagin
,
while
Bill
undoes
the
*NL*
petticuts
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
These
united
restoratives
,
administered
with
great
energy
:
especially
*NL*
that
department
consigned
to
Master
Bates
,
who
appeared
to
consider
his
*NL*
share
in
the
proceedings
,
a
piece
of
unexampled
pleasantry
:
were
not
*NL*
long
in
producing
the
desired
effect
.
The
girl
gradually
recovered
her
*NL*
senses
;
and
,
staggering
to
a
chair
by
the
bedside
,
hid
her
face
upon
*NL*
the
pillow
:
leaving
Mr.
Sikes
to
confront
the
new
comers
,
in
some
*NL*
astonishment
at
their
unlooked-for
appearance
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
what
evil
wind
has
blowed
you
here
?
'
he
asked
Fagin
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
evil
wind
at
all
,
my
dear
,
for
evil
winds
blow
nobody
any
good
;
and
*NL*
I
've
brought
something
good
with
me
,
that
you
'll
be
glad
to
see
.
*NL*
Dodger
,
my
dear
,
open
the
bundle
;
and
give
Bill
the
little
trifles
that
*NL*
we
spent
all
our
money
on
,
this
morning
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
In
compliance
with
Mr.
Fagin
's
request
,
the
Artful
untied
this
bundle
,
*NL*
which
was
of
large
size
,
and
formed
of
an
old
table-cloth
;
and
handed
*NL*
the
articles
it
contained
,
one
by
one
,
to
Charley
Bates
:
who
placed
*NL*
them
on
the
table
,
with
various
encomiums
on
their
rarity
and
*NL*
excellence
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Sitch
a
rabbit
pie
,
Bill
,
'
exclaimed
that
young
gentleman
,
disclosing
*NL*
to
view
a
huge
pasty
;
`
sitch
delicate
creeturs
,
with
sitch
tender
*NL*
limbs
,
Bill
,
that
the
wery
bones
melt
in
your
mouth
,
and
there
's
no
*NL*
occasion
to
pick
'em
;
half
a
pound
of
seven
and
six-penny
green
,
so
*NL*
precious
strong
that
if
you
mix
it
with
biling
water
,
it
'll
go
nigh
to
*NL*
blow
the
lid
of
the
tea-pot
off
;
a
pound
and
a
half
of
moist
sugar
that
*NL*
the
niggers
did
n't
work
at
all
at
,
afore
they
got
it
up
to
sitch
a
*NL*
pitch
of
goodness
,
--
oh
no
!
Two
half-quartern
brans
;
pound
of
best
*NL*
fresh
;
piece
of
double
Glo
`
ster
;
and
,
to
wind
up
all
,
some
of
the
*NL*
richest
sort
you
ever
lushed
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Uttering
this
last
panegyric
,
Master
Bates
produced
,
from
one
of
his
*NL*
extensive
pockets
,
a
full-sized
wine-bottle
,
carefully
corked
;
while
*NL*
Mr.
Dawkins
,
at
the
same
instant
,
poured
out
a
wine-glassful
of
raw
*NL*
spirits
from
the
bottle
he
carried
:
which
the
invalid
tossed
down
his
*NL*
throat
without
a
moment
's
hesitation
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ah
!
'
said
Fagin
,
rubbing
his
hands
with
great
satisfaction
.
`
You
'll
*NL*
do
,
Bill
;
you
'll
do
now
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Do
!
'
exclaimed
Mr.
Sikes
;
'
I
might
have
been
done
for
,
twenty
times
*NL*
over
,
afore
you
'd
have
done
anything
to
help
me
.
What
do
you
mean
by
*NL*
leaving
a
man
in
this
state
,
three
weeks
and
more
,
you
false-hearted
*NL*
wagabond
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Only
hear
him
,
boys
!
'
said
Fagin
,
shrugging
his
shoulders
.
`
And
us
*NL*
come
to
bring
him
all
these
beau-ti-ful
things
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
things
is
well
enough
in
their
way
,
'
observed
Mr.
Sikes
:
a
little
*NL*
soothed
as
he
glanced
over
the
table
;
`
but
what
have
you
got
to
say
for
*NL*
yourself
,
why
you
should
leave
me
here
,
down
in
the
mouth
,
health
,
*NL*
blunt
,
and
everything
else
;
and
take
no
more
notice
of
me
,
all
this
*NL*
mortal
time
,
than
if
I
was
that
`
ere
dog
.
--
Drive
him
down
,
Charley
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
never
see
such
a
jolly
dog
as
that
,
'
cried
Master
Bates
,
doing
as
he
*NL*
was
desired
.
`
Smelling
the
grub
like
a
old
lady
a
going
to
market
!
*NL*
He
'd
make
his
fortun
'
on
the
stage
that
dog
would
,
and
rewive
the
*NL*
drayma
besides
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Hold
your
din
,
'
cried
Sikes
,
as
the
dog
retreated
under
the
bed
:
still
*NL*
growling
angrily
.
`
What
have
you
got
to
say
for
yourself
,
you
withered
*NL*
old
fence
,
eh
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
was
away
from
London
,
a
week
and
more
,
my
dear
,
on
a
plant
,
'
replied
*NL*
the
Jew
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
what
about
the
other
fortnight
?
'
demanded
Sikes
.
`
What
about
the
*NL*
other
fortnight
that
you
've
left
me
lying
here
,
like
a
sick
rat
in
his
*NL*
hole
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
could
n't
help
it
,
Bill
.
I
ca
n't
go
into
a
long
explanation
before
*NL*
company
;
but
I
could
n't
help
it
,
upon
my
honour
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Upon
your
what
?
'
growled
Sikes
,
with
excessive
disgust
.
`
Here
!
Cut
me
*NL*
off
a
piece
of
that
pie
,
one
of
you
boys
,
to
take
the
taste
of
that
out
*NL*
of
my
mouth
,
or
it
'll
choke
me
dead
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Do
n't
be
out
of
temper
,
my
dear
,
'
urged
Fagin
,
submissively
.
'
I
have
*NL*
never
forgot
you
,
Bill
;
never
once
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
!
I
'll
pound
it
that
you
ha
n't
,
'
replied
Sikes
,
with
a
bitter
grin
.
*NL*
`
You
've
been
scheming
and
plotting
away
,
every
hour
that
I
have
laid
*NL*
shivering
and
burning
here
;
and
Bill
was
to
do
this
;
and
Bill
was
to
do
*NL*
that
;
and
Bill
was
to
do
it
all
,
dirt
cheap
,
as
soon
as
he
got
well
:
*NL*
and
was
quite
poor
enough
for
your
work
.
If
it
had
n't
been
for
the
*NL*
girl
,
I
might
have
died
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
There
now
,
Bill
,
'
remonstrated
Fagin
,
eagerly
catching
at
the
word
.
*NL*
`
If
it
had
n't
been
for
the
girl
!
Who
but
poor
ould
Fagin
was
the
means
*NL*
of
your
having
such
a
handy
girl
about
you
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
says
true
enough
there
!
'
said
Nancy
,
coming
hastily
forward
.
`
Let
*NL*
him
be
;
let
him
be
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Nancy
's
appearance
gave
a
new
turn
to
the
conversation
;
for
the
boys
,
*NL*
receiving
a
sly
wink
from
the
wary
old
Jew
,
began
to
ply
her
with
*NL*
liquor
:
of
which
,
however
,
she
took
very
sparingly
;
while
Fagin
,
*NL*
assuming
an
unusual
flow
of
spirits
,
gradually
brought
Mr.
Sikes
into
a
*NL*
better
temper
,
by
affecting
to
regard
his
threats
as
a
little
pleasant
*NL*
banter
;
and
,
moreover
,
by
laughing
very
heartily
at
one
or
two
rough
*NL*
jokes
,
which
,
after
repeated
applications
to
the
spirit-bottle
,
he
*NL*
condescended
to
make
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
's
all
very
well
,
'
said
Mr.
Sikes
;
`
but
I
must
have
some
blunt
from
*NL*
you
to-night
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
have
n't
a
piece
of
coin
about
me
,
'
replied
the
Jew
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Then
you
've
got
lots
at
home
,
'
retorted
Sikes
;
`
and
I
must
have
some
*NL*
from
there
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Lots
!
'
cried
Fagin
,
holding
up
is
hands
.
'
I
have
n't
so
much
as
*NL*
would
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
do
n't
know
how
much
you
've
got
,
and
I
dare
say
you
hardly
know
*NL*
yourself
,
as
it
would
take
a
pretty
long
time
to
count
it
,
'
said
Sikes
;
*NL*
`
but
I
must
have
some
to-night
;
and
that
's
flat
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
well
,
'
said
Fagin
,
with
a
sigh
,
`
I
'll
send
the
Artful
round
*NL*
presently
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
wo
n't
do
nothing
of
the
kind
,
'
rejoined
Mr.
Sikes
.
`
The
Artful
's
a
*NL*
deal
too
artful
,
and
would
forget
to
come
,
or
lose
his
way
,
or
get
*NL*
dodged
by
traps
and
so
be
perwented
,
or
anything
for
an
excuse
,
if
you
*NL*
put
him
up
to
it
.
Nancy
shall
go
to
the
ken
and
fetch
it
,
to
make
all
*NL*
sure
;
and
I
'll
lie
down
and
have
a
snooze
while
she
's
gone
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
great
deal
of
haggling
and
squabbling
,
Fagin
beat
down
the
*NL*
amount
of
the
required
advance
from
five
pounds
to
three
pounds
four
*NL*
and
sixpence
:
protesting
with
many
solemn
asseverations
that
that
would
*NL*
only
leave
him
eighteen-pence
to
keep
house
with
;
Mr.
Sikes
sullenly
*NL*
remarking
that
if
he
could
n't
get
any
more
he
must
accompany
him
home
;
*NL*
with
the
Dodger
and
Master
Bates
put
the
eatables
in
the
cupboard
.
The
*NL*
Jew
then
,
taking
leave
of
his
affectionate
friend
,
returned
homeward
,
*NL*
attended
by
Nancy
and
the
boys
:
Mr.
Sikes
,
meanwhile
,
flinging
himself
*NL*
on
the
bed
,
and
composing
himself
to
sleep
away
the
time
until
the
*NL*
young
lady
's
return
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
due
course
,
they
arrived
at
Fagin
's
abode
,
where
they
found
Toby
*NL*
Crackit
and
Mr.
Chitling
intent
upon
their
fifteenth
game
at
cribbage
,
*NL*
which
it
is
scarcely
necessary
to
say
the
latter
gentleman
lost
,
and
*NL*
with
it
,
his
fifteenth
and
last
sixpence
:
much
to
the
amusement
of
his
*NL*
young
friends
.
Mr.
Crackit
,
apparently
somewhat
ashamed
at
being
found
*NL*
relaxing
himself
with
a
gentleman
so
much
his
inferior
in
station
and
*NL*
mental
endowments
,
yawned
,
and
inquiring
after
Sikes
,
took
up
his
hat
*NL*
to
go
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Has
nobody
been
,
Toby
?
'
asked
Fagin
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Not
a
living
leg
,
'
answered
Mr.
Crackit
,
pulling
up
his
collar
;
`
it
's
*NL*
been
as
dull
as
swipes
.
You
ought
to
stand
something
handsome
,
Fagin
,
*NL*
to
recompense
me
for
keeping
house
so
long
.
Damme
,
I
'm
as
flat
as
a
*NL*
juryman
;
and
should
have
gone
to
sleep
,
as
fast
as
Newgate
,
if
I
had
n't
*NL*
had
the
good
natur
'
to
amuse
this
youngster
.
Horrid
dull
,
I
'm
blessed
*NL*
if
I
a
n't
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
With
these
and
other
ejaculations
of
the
same
kind
,
Mr.
Toby
Crackit
*NL*
swept
up
his
winnings
,
and
crammed
them
into
his
waistcoat
pocket
with
*NL*
a
haughty
air
,
as
though
such
small
pieces
of
silver
were
wholly
*NL*
beneath
the
consideration
of
a
man
of
his
figure
;
this
done
,
he
*NL*
swaggered
out
of
the
room
,
with
so
much
elegance
and
gentility
,
that
*NL*
Mr.
Chitling
,
bestowing
numerous
admiring
glances
on
his
legs
and
boots
*NL*
till
they
were
out
of
sight
,
assured
the
company
that
he
considered
his
*NL*
acquaintance
cheap
at
fifteen
sixpences
an
interview
,
and
that
he
*NL*
did
n't
value
his
losses
the
snap
of
his
little
finger
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Wot
a
rum
chap
you
are
,
Tom
!
'
said
Master
Bates
,
highly
amused
by
this
*NL*
declaration
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Not
a
bit
of
it
,
'
replied
Mr.
Chitling
.
`
Am
I
,
Fagin
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
A
very
clever
fellow
,
my
dear
,
'
said
Fagin
,
patting
him
on
the
*NL*
shoulder
,
and
winking
to
his
other
pupils
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
Mr.
Crackit
is
a
heavy
swell
;
a
n't
he
,
Fagin
?
'
asked
Tom
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
doubt
at
all
of
that
,
my
dear
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
it
is
a
creditable
thing
to
have
his
acquaintance
;
a
n't
it
,
*NL*
Fagin
?
'
pursued
Tom
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Very
much
so
,
indeed
,
my
dear
.
They
're
only
jealous
,
Tom
,
because
he
*NL*
wo
n't
give
it
to
them
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ah
!
'
cried
Tom
,
triumphantly
,
`
that
's
where
it
is
!
He
has
cleaned
me
*NL*
out
.
But
I
can
go
and
earn
some
more
,
when
I
like
;
ca
n't
I
,
Fagin
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
To
be
sure
you
can
,
and
the
sooner
you
go
the
better
,
Tom
;
so
make
up
*NL*
your
loss
at
once
,
and
do
n't
lose
any
more
time
.
Dodger
!
Charley
!
*NL*
It
's
time
you
were
on
the
lay
.
Come
!
It
's
near
ten
,
and
nothing
done
*NL*
yet
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
In
obedience
to
this
hint
,
the
boys
,
nodding
to
Nancy
,
took
up
their
*NL*
hats
,
and
left
the
room
;
the
Dodger
and
his
vivacious
friend
indulging
,
*NL*
as
they
went
,
in
many
witticisms
at
the
expense
of
Mr.
Chitling
;
in
*NL*
whose
conduct
,
it
is
but
justice
to
say
,
there
was
nothing
very
*NL*
conspicuous
or
peculiar
:
inasmuch
as
there
are
a
great
number
of
*NL*
spirited
young
bloods
upon
town
,
who
pay
a
much
higher
price
than
Mr.
*NL*
Chitling
for
being
seen
in
good
society
:
and
a
great
number
of
fine
*NL*
gentlemen
-LRB-
composing
the
good
society
aforesaid
-RRB-
who
established
their
*NL*
reputation
upon
very
much
the
same
footing
as
flash
Toby
Crackit
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Now
,
'
said
Fagin
,
when
they
had
left
the
room
,
`
I
'll
go
and
get
you
*NL*
that
cash
,
Nancy
.
This
is
only
the
key
of
a
little
cupboard
where
I
*NL*
keep
a
few
odd
things
the
boys
get
,
my
dear
.
I
never
lock
up
my
money
,
*NL*
for
I
've
got
none
to
lock
up
,
my
dear
--
ha
!
ha
!
ha
!
--
none
to
lock
up
.
*NL*
It
's
a
poor
trade
,
Nancy
,
and
no
thanks
;
but
I
'm
fond
of
seeing
the
*NL*
young
people
about
me
;
and
I
bear
it
all
,
I
bear
it
all
.
Hush
!
'
he
*NL*
said
,
hastily
concealing
the
key
in
his
breast
;
`
who
's
that
?
Listen
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
girl
,
who
was
sitting
at
the
table
with
her
arms
folded
,
appeared
*NL*
in
no
way
interested
in
the
arrival
:
or
to
care
whether
the
person
,
*NL*
whoever
he
was
,
came
or
went
:
until
the
murmur
of
a
man
's
voice
*NL*
reached
her
ears
.
The
instant
she
caught
the
sound
,
she
tore
off
her
*NL*
bonnet
and
shawl
,
with
the
rapidity
of
lightning
,
and
thrust
them
under
*NL*
the
table
.
The
Jew
,
turning
round
immediately
afterwards
,
she
muttered
*NL*
a
complaint
of
the
heat
:
in
a
tone
of
languor
that
contrasted
,
very
*NL*
remarkably
,
with
the
extreme
haste
and
violence
of
this
action
:
which
,
*NL*
however
,
had
been
unobserved
by
Fagin
,
who
had
his
back
towards
her
at
*NL*
the
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Bah
!
'
he
whispered
,
as
though
nettled
by
the
interruption
;
`
it
's
the
*NL*
man
I
expected
before
;
he
's
coming
downstairs
.
Not
a
word
about
the
*NL*
money
while
he
's
here
,
Nance
.
He
wo
n't
stop
long
.
Not
ten
minutes
,
my
*NL*
dear
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Laying
his
skinny
forefinger
upon
his
lip
,
the
Jew
carried
a
candle
to
*NL*
the
door
,
as
a
man
's
step
was
heard
upon
the
stairs
without
.
He
*NL*
reached
it
,
at
the
same
moment
as
the
visitor
,
who
,
coming
hastily
into
*NL*
the
room
,
was
close
upon
the
girl
before
he
observed
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
Monks
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Only
one
of
my
young
people
,
'
said
Fagin
,
observing
that
Monks
drew
*NL*
back
,
on
beholding
a
stranger
.
`
Do
n't
move
,
Nancy
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
girl
drew
closer
to
the
table
,
and
glancing
at
Monks
with
an
air
of
*NL*
careless
levity
,
withdrew
her
eyes
;
but
as
he
turned
towards
Fagin
,
she
*NL*
stole
another
look
;
so
keen
and
searching
,
and
full
of
purpose
,
that
if
*NL*
there
had
been
any
bystander
to
observe
the
change
,
he
could
hardly
*NL*
have
believed
the
two
looks
to
have
proceeded
from
the
same
person
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Any
news
?
'
inquired
Fagin
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Great
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
--
and
--
good
?
'
asked
Fagin
,
hesitating
as
though
he
feared
to
vex
*NL*
the
other
man
by
being
too
sanguine
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Not
bad
,
any
way
,
'
replied
Monks
with
a
smile
.
'
I
have
been
prompt
*NL*
enough
this
time
.
Let
me
have
a
word
with
you
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
girl
drew
closer
to
the
table
,
and
made
no
offer
to
leave
the
room
,
*NL*
although
she
could
see
that
Monks
was
pointing
to
her
.
The
Jew
:
*NL*
perhaps
fearing
she
might
say
something
aloud
about
the
money
,
if
he
*NL*
endeavoured
to
get
rid
of
her
:
pointed
upward
,
and
took
Monks
out
of
*NL*
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Not
that
infernal
hole
we
were
in
before
,
'
she
could
hear
the
man
say
*NL*
as
they
went
upstairs
.
Fagin
laughed
;
and
making
some
reply
which
did
*NL*
not
reach
her
,
seemed
,
by
the
creaking
of
the
boards
,
to
lead
his
*NL*
companion
to
the
second
story
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
the
sound
of
their
footsteps
had
ceased
to
echo
through
the
*NL*
house
,
the
girl
had
slipped
off
her
shoes
;
and
drawing
her
gown
loosely
*NL*
over
her
head
,
and
muffling
her
arms
in
it
,
stood
at
the
door
,
*NL*
listening
with
breathless
interest
.
The
moment
the
noise
ceased
,
she
*NL*
glided
from
the
room
;
ascended
the
stairs
with
incredible
softness
and
*NL*
silence
;
and
was
lost
in
the
gloom
above
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
room
remained
deserted
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
or
more
;
the
girl
*NL*
glided
back
with
the
same
unearthly
tread
;
and
,
immediately
afterwards
,
*NL*
the
two
men
were
heard
descending
.
Monks
went
at
once
into
the
street
;
*NL*
and
the
Jew
crawled
upstairs
again
for
the
money
.
When
he
returned
,
*NL*
the
girl
was
adjusting
her
shawl
and
bonnet
,
as
if
preparing
to
be
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
Nance
!
'
exclaimed
the
Jew
,
starting
back
as
he
put
down
the
*NL*
candle
,
`
how
pale
you
are
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Pale
!
'
echoed
the
girl
,
shading
her
eyes
with
her
hands
,
as
if
to
look
*NL*
steadily
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Quite
horrible
.
What
have
you
been
doing
to
yourself
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Nothing
that
I
know
of
,
except
sitting
in
this
close
place
for
I
do
n't
*NL*
know
how
long
and
all
,
'
replied
the
girl
carelessly
.
`
Come
!
Let
me
get
*NL*
back
;
that
's
a
dear
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
With
a
sigh
for
every
piece
of
money
,
Fagin
told
the
amount
into
her
*NL*
hand
.
They
parted
without
more
conversation
,
merely
interchanging
a
*NL*
`
good-night
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
girl
got
into
the
open
street
,
she
sat
down
upon
a
doorstep
;
*NL*
and
seemed
,
for
a
few
moments
,
wholly
bewildered
and
unable
to
pursue
*NL*
her
way
.
Suddenly
she
arose
;
and
hurrying
on
,
in
a
direction
quite
*NL*
opposite
to
that
in
which
Sikes
was
awaiting
her
returned
,
quickened
*NL*
her
pace
,
until
it
gradually
resolved
into
a
violent
run
.
After
*NL*
completely
exhausting
herself
,
she
stopped
to
take
breath
:
and
,
as
if
*NL*
suddenly
recollecting
herself
,
and
deploring
her
inability
to
do
*NL*
something
she
was
bent
upon
,
wrung
her
hands
,
and
burst
into
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
might
be
that
her
tears
relieved
her
,
or
that
she
felt
the
full
*NL*
hopelessness
of
her
condition
;
but
she
turned
back
;
and
hurrying
with
*NL*
nearly
as
great
rapidity
in
the
contrary
direction
;
partly
to
recover
*NL*
lost
time
,
and
partly
to
keep
pace
with
the
violent
current
of
her
own
*NL*
thoughts
:
soon
reached
the
dwelling
where
she
had
left
the
*NL*
housebreaker
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
she
betrayed
any
agitation
,
when
she
presented
herself
to
Mr.
Sikes
,
*NL*
he
did
not
observe
it
;
for
merely
inquiring
if
she
had
brought
the
*NL*
money
,
and
receiving
a
reply
in
the
affirmative
,
he
uttered
a
growl
of
*NL*
satisfaction
,
and
replacing
his
head
upon
the
pillow
,
resumed
the
*NL*
slumbers
which
her
arrival
had
interrupted
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
fortunate
for
her
that
the
possession
of
money
occasioned
him
so
*NL*
much
employment
next
day
in
the
way
of
eating
and
drinking
;
and
withal
*NL*
had
so
beneficial
an
effect
in
smoothing
down
the
asperities
of
his
*NL*
temper
;
that
he
had
neither
time
nor
inclination
to
be
very
critical
*NL*
upon
her
behaviour
and
deportment
.
That
she
had
all
the
abstracted
and
*NL*
nervous
manner
of
one
who
is
on
the
eve
of
some
bold
and
hazardous
*NL*
step
,
which
it
has
required
no
common
struggle
to
resolve
upon
,
would
*NL*
have
been
obvious
to
the
lynx-eyed
Fagin
,
who
would
most
probably
have
*NL*
taken
the
alarm
at
once
;
but
Mr.
Sikes
lacking
the
niceties
of
*NL*
discrimination
,
and
being
troubled
with
no
more
subtle
misgivings
than
*NL*
those
which
resolve
themselves
into
a
dogged
roughness
of
behaviour
*NL*
towards
everybody
;
and
being
,
furthermore
,
in
an
unusually
amiable
*NL*
condition
,
as
has
been
already
observed
;
saw
nothing
unusual
in
her
*NL*
demeanor
,
and
indeed
,
troubled
himself
so
little
about
her
,
that
,
had
*NL*
her
agitation
been
far
more
perceptible
than
it
was
,
it
would
have
been
*NL*
very
unlikely
to
have
awakened
his
suspicions
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
that
day
closed
in
,
the
girl
's
excitement
increased
;
and
,
when
night
*NL*
came
on
,
and
she
sat
by
,
watching
until
the
housebreaker
should
drink
*NL*
himself
asleep
,
there
was
an
unusual
paleness
in
her
cheek
,
and
a
fire
*NL*
in
her
eye
,
that
even
Sikes
observed
with
astonishment
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Sikes
being
weak
from
the
fever
,
was
lying
in
bed
,
taking
hot
water
*NL*
with
his
gin
to
render
it
less
inflammatory
;
and
had
pushed
his
glass
*NL*
towards
Nancy
to
be
replenished
for
the
third
or
fourth
time
,
when
*NL*
these
symptoms
first
struck
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
burn
my
body
!
'
said
the
man
,
raising
himself
on
his
hands
as
he
*NL*
stared
the
girl
in
the
face
.
`
You
look
like
a
corpse
come
to
life
*NL*
again
.
What
's
the
matter
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Matter
!
'
replied
the
girl
.
`
Nothing
.
What
do
you
look
at
me
so
hard
*NL*
for
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
foolery
is
this
?
'
demanded
Sikes
,
grasping
her
by
the
arm
,
and
*NL*
shaking
her
roughly
.
`
What
is
it
?
What
do
you
mean
?
What
are
you
*NL*
thinking
of
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Of
many
things
,
Bill
,
'
replied
the
girl
,
shivering
,
and
as
she
did
so
,
*NL*
pressing
her
hands
upon
her
eyes
.
`
But
,
Lord
!
What
odds
in
that
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
tone
of
forced
gaiety
in
which
the
last
words
were
spoken
,
seemed
*NL*
to
produce
a
deeper
impression
on
Sikes
than
the
wild
and
rigid
look
*NL*
which
had
preceded
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
tell
you
wot
it
is
,
'
said
Sikes
;
`
if
you
have
n't
caught
the
fever
,
*NL*
and
got
it
comin
'
on
,
now
,
there
's
something
more
than
usual
in
the
*NL*
wind
,
and
something
dangerous
too
.
You
're
not
a-going
to
--
.
No
,
*NL*
damme
!
you
would
n't
do
that
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Do
what
?
'
asked
the
girl
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
There
ai
n't
,
'
said
Sikes
,
fixing
his
eyes
upon
her
,
and
muttering
the
*NL*
words
to
himself
;
`
there
ai
n't
a
stauncher-hearted
gal
going
,
or
I
'd
*NL*
have
cut
her
throat
three
months
ago
.
She
's
got
the
fever
coming
on
;
*NL*
that
's
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Fortifying
himself
with
this
assurance
,
Sikes
drained
the
glass
to
the
*NL*
bottom
,
and
then
,
with
many
grumbling
oaths
,
called
for
his
physic
.
*NL*
The
girl
jumped
up
,
with
great
alacrity
;
poured
it
quickly
out
,
but
*NL*
with
her
back
towards
him
;
and
held
the
vessel
to
his
lips
,
while
he
*NL*
drank
off
the
contents
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Now
,
'
said
the
robber
,
`
come
and
sit
aside
of
me
,
and
put
on
your
own
*NL*
face
;
or
I
'll
alter
it
so
,
that
you
wo
n't
know
it
agin
when
you
do
want
*NL*
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
girl
obeyed
.
Sikes
,
locking
her
hand
in
his
,
fell
back
upon
the
*NL*
pillow
:
turning
his
eyes
upon
her
face
.
They
closed
;
opened
again
;
*NL*
closed
once
more
;
again
opened
.
He
shifted
his
position
restlessly
;
*NL*
and
,
after
dozing
again
,
and
again
,
for
two
or
three
minutes
,
and
as
*NL*
often
springing
up
with
a
look
of
terror
,
and
gazing
vacantly
about
*NL*
him
,
was
suddenly
stricken
,
as
it
were
,
while
in
the
very
attitude
of
*NL*
rising
,
into
a
deep
and
heavy
sleep
.
The
grasp
of
his
hand
relaxed
;
*NL*
the
upraised
arm
fell
languidly
by
his
side
;
and
he
lay
like
one
in
a
*NL*
profound
trance
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
laudanum
has
taken
effect
at
last
,
'
murmured
the
girl
,
as
she
rose
*NL*
from
the
bedside
.
'
I
may
be
too
late
,
even
now
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
hastily
dressed
herself
in
her
bonnet
and
shawl
:
looking
fearfully
*NL*
round
,
from
time
to
time
,
as
if
,
despite
the
sleeping
draught
,
she
*NL*
expected
every
moment
to
feel
the
pressure
of
Sikes
's
heavy
hand
upon
*NL*
her
shoulder
;
then
,
stooping
softly
over
the
bed
,
she
kissed
the
*NL*
robber
's
lips
;
and
then
opening
and
closing
the
room-door
with
*NL*
noiseless
touch
,
hurried
from
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
watchman
was
crying
half-past
nine
,
down
a
dark
passage
through
which
*NL*
she
had
to
pass
,
in
gaining
the
main
thoroughfare
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Has
it
long
gone
the
half-hour
?
'
asked
the
girl
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
'll
strike
the
hour
in
another
quarter
,
'
said
the
man
:
raising
his
*NL*
lantern
to
her
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
I
can
not
get
there
in
less
than
an
hour
or
more
,
'
muttered
Nancy
:
*NL*
brushing
swiftly
past
him
,
and
gliding
rapidly
down
the
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
Many
of
the
shops
were
already
closing
in
the
back
lanes
and
avenues
*NL*
through
which
she
tracked
her
way
,
in
making
from
Spitalfields
towards
*NL*
the
West-End
of
London
.
The
clock
struck
ten
,
increasing
her
*NL*
impatience
.
She
tore
along
the
narrow
pavement
:
elbowing
the
*NL*
passengers
from
side
to
side
;
and
darting
almost
under
the
horses
'
*NL*
heads
,
crossed
crowded
streets
,
where
clusters
of
persons
were
eagerly
*NL*
watching
their
opportunity
to
do
the
like
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
woman
is
mad
!
'
said
the
people
,
turning
to
look
after
her
as
she
*NL*
rushed
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
reached
the
more
wealthy
quarter
of
the
town
,
the
streets
were
*NL*
comparatively
deserted
;
and
here
her
headlong
progress
excited
a
still
*NL*
greater
curiosity
in
the
stragglers
whom
she
hurried
past
.
Some
*NL*
quickened
their
pace
behind
,
as
though
to
see
whither
she
was
hastening
*NL*
at
such
an
unusual
rate
;
and
a
few
made
head
upon
her
,
and
looked
back
,
*NL*
surprised
at
her
undiminished
speed
;
but
they
fell
off
one
by
one
;
and
*NL*
when
she
neared
her
place
of
destination
,
she
was
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
family
hotel
in
a
quiet
but
handsome
street
near
Hyde
Park
.
*NL*
As
the
brilliant
light
of
the
lamp
which
burnt
before
its
door
,
guided
*NL*
her
to
the
spot
,
the
clock
struck
eleven
.
She
had
loitered
for
a
few
*NL*
paces
as
though
irresolute
,
and
making
up
her
mind
to
advance
;
but
the
*NL*
sound
determined
her
,
and
she
stepped
into
the
hall
.
The
porter
's
seat
*NL*
was
vacant
.
She
looked
round
with
an
air
of
incertitude
,
and
advanced
*NL*
towards
the
stairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Now
,
young
woman
!
'
said
a
smartly-dressed
female
,
looking
out
from
a
*NL*
door
behind
her
,
`
who
do
you
want
here
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
A
lady
who
is
stopping
in
this
house
,
'
answered
the
girl
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
A
lady
!
'
was
the
reply
,
accompanied
with
a
scornful
look
.
`
What
lady
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Miss
Maylie
,
'
said
Nancy
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
woman
,
who
had
by
this
time
,
noted
her
appearance
,
replied
*NL*
only
by
a
look
of
virtuous
disdain
;
and
summoned
a
man
to
answer
her
.
*NL*
To
him
,
Nancy
repeated
her
request
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
name
am
I
to
say
?
'
asked
the
waiter
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
's
of
no
use
saying
any
,
'
replied
Nancy
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Nor
business
?
'
said
the
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
nor
that
neither
,
'
rejoined
the
girl
.
'
I
must
see
the
lady
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Come
!
'
said
the
man
,
pushing
her
towards
the
door
.
`
None
of
this
.
*NL*
Take
yourself
off
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
shall
be
carried
out
if
I
go
!
'
said
the
girl
violently
;
`
and
I
can
*NL*
make
that
a
job
that
two
of
you
wo
n't
like
to
do
.
Is
n't
there
anybody
*NL*
here
,
'
she
said
,
looking
round
,
`
that
will
see
a
simple
message
carried
*NL*
for
a
poor
wretch
like
me
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
This
appeal
produced
an
effect
on
a
good-tempered-faced
man-cook
,
who
*NL*
with
some
of
the
other
servants
was
looking
on
,
and
who
stepped
forward
*NL*
to
interfere
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Take
it
up
for
her
,
Joe
;
ca
n't
you
?
'
said
this
person
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
's
the
good
?
'
replied
the
man
.
`
You
do
n't
suppose
the
young
lady
*NL*
will
see
such
as
her
;
do
you
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
This
allusion
to
Nancy
's
doubtful
character
,
raised
a
vast
quantity
of
*NL*
chaste
wrath
in
the
bosoms
of
four
housemaids
,
who
remarked
,
with
great
*NL*
fervour
,
that
the
creature
was
a
disgrace
to
her
sex
;
and
strongly
*NL*
advocated
her
being
thrown
,
ruthlessly
,
into
the
kennel
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Do
what
you
like
with
me
,
'
said
the
girl
,
turning
to
the
men
again
;
*NL*
`
but
do
what
I
ask
you
first
,
and
I
ask
you
to
give
this
message
for
*NL*
God
Almighty
's
sake
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
soft-hearted
cook
added
his
intercession
,
and
the
result
was
that
*NL*
the
man
who
had
first
appeared
undertook
its
delivery
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
's
it
to
be
?
'
said
the
man
,
with
one
foot
on
the
stairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
a
young
woman
earnestly
asks
to
speak
to
Miss
Maylie
alone
,
'
said
*NL*
Nancy
;
`
and
that
if
the
lady
will
only
hear
the
first
word
she
has
to
*NL*
say
,
she
will
know
whether
to
hear
her
business
,
or
to
have
her
turned
*NL*
out
of
doors
as
an
impostor
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
say
,
'
said
the
man
,
`
you
're
coming
it
strong
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
give
the
message
,
'
said
the
girl
firmly
;
`
and
let
me
hear
the
*NL*
answer
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
ran
upstairs
.
Nancy
remained
,
pale
and
almost
breathless
,
*NL*
listening
with
quivering
lip
to
the
very
audible
expressions
of
scorn
,
*NL*
of
which
the
chaste
housemaids
were
very
prolific
;
and
of
which
they
*NL*
became
still
more
so
,
when
the
man
returned
,
and
said
the
young
woman
*NL*
was
to
walk
upstairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
's
no
good
being
proper
in
this
world
,
'
said
the
first
housemaid
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Brass
can
do
better
than
the
gold
what
has
stood
the
fire
,
'
said
the
*NL*
second
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
third
contented
herself
with
wondering
`
what
ladies
was
made
of
'
;
*NL*
and
the
fourth
took
the
first
in
a
quartette
of
`
Shameful
!
'
with
which
*NL*
the
Dianas
concluded
.
*NL*
*NL*
Regardless
of
all
this
:
for
she
had
weightier
matters
at
heart
:
Nancy
*NL*
followed
the
man
,
with
trembling
limbs
,
to
a
small
ante-chamber
,
*NL*
lighted
by
a
lamp
from
the
ceiling
.
Here
he
left
her
,
and
retired
.

CHAPTER
XL
*NL*
*NL*
A
STRANGE
INTERVIEW
,
WHICH
IS
A
SEQUEL
TO
THE
LAST
CHAMBER
*NL*
*NL*
The
girl
's
life
had
been
squandered
in
the
streets
,
and
among
the
most
*NL*
noisome
of
the
stews
and
dens
of
London
,
but
there
was
something
of
the
*NL*
woman
's
original
nature
left
in
her
still
;
and
when
she
heard
a
light
*NL*
step
approaching
the
door
opposite
to
that
by
which
she
had
entered
,
*NL*
and
thought
of
the
wide
contrast
which
the
small
room
would
in
another
*NL*
moment
contain
,
she
felt
burdened
with
the
sense
of
her
own
deep
shame
,
*NL*
and
shrunk
as
though
she
could
scarcely
bear
the
presence
of
her
with
*NL*
whom
she
had
sought
this
interview
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
struggling
with
these
better
feelings
was
pride
,
--
the
vice
of
the
*NL*
lowest
and
most
debased
creatures
no
less
than
of
the
high
and
*NL*
self-assured
.
The
miserable
companion
of
thieves
and
ruffians
,
the
*NL*
fallen
outcast
of
low
haunts
,
the
associate
of
the
scourings
of
the
*NL*
jails
and
hulks
,
living
within
the
shadow
of
the
gallows
itself
,
--
even
*NL*
this
degraded
being
felt
too
proud
to
betray
a
feeble
gleam
of
the
*NL*
womanly
feeling
which
she
thought
a
weakness
,
but
which
alone
connected
*NL*
her
with
that
humanity
,
of
which
her
wasting
life
had
obliterated
so
*NL*
many
,
many
traces
when
a
very
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
raised
her
eyes
sufficiently
to
observe
that
the
figure
which
*NL*
presented
itself
was
that
of
a
slight
and
beautiful
girl
;
then
,
bending
*NL*
them
on
the
ground
,
she
tossed
her
head
with
affected
carelessness
as
*NL*
she
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
's
a
hard
matter
to
get
to
see
you
,
lady
.
If
I
had
taken
offence
,
*NL*
and
gone
away
,
as
many
would
have
done
,
you
'd
have
been
sorry
for
it
*NL*
one
day
,
and
not
without
reason
either
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
am
very
sorry
if
any
one
has
behaved
harshly
to
you
,
'
replied
Rose
.
*NL*
`
Do
not
think
of
that
.
Tell
me
why
you
wished
to
see
me
.
I
am
the
*NL*
person
you
inquired
for
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
kind
tone
of
this
answer
,
the
sweet
voice
,
the
gentle
manner
,
the
*NL*
absence
of
any
accent
of
haughtiness
or
displeasure
,
took
the
girl
*NL*
completely
by
surprise
,
and
she
burst
into
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
,
lady
,
lady
!
'
she
said
,
clasping
her
hands
passionately
before
her
*NL*
face
,
`
if
there
was
more
like
you
,
there
would
be
fewer
like
me
,
--
there
*NL*
would
--
there
would
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Sit
down
,
'
said
Rose
,
earnestly
.
`
If
you
are
in
poverty
or
affliction
*NL*
I
shall
be
truly
glad
to
relieve
you
if
I
can
,
--
I
shall
indeed
.
Sit
*NL*
down
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Let
me
stand
,
lady
,
'
said
the
girl
,
still
weeping
,
`
and
do
not
speak
*NL*
to
me
so
kindly
till
you
know
me
better
.
It
is
growing
late
.
*NL*
Is
--
is
--
that
door
shut
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
'
said
Rose
,
recoiling
a
few
steps
,
as
if
to
be
nearer
assistance
*NL*
in
case
she
should
require
it
.
`
Why
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Because
,
'
said
the
girl
,
'
I
am
about
to
put
my
life
and
the
lives
of
*NL*
others
in
your
hands
.
I
am
the
girl
that
dragged
little
Oliver
back
to
*NL*
old
Fagin
's
on
the
night
he
went
out
from
the
house
in
Pentonville
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
!
'
said
Rose
Maylie
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
,
lady
!
'
replied
the
girl
.
'
I
am
the
infamous
creature
you
have
*NL*
heard
of
,
that
lives
among
the
thieves
,
and
that
never
from
the
first
*NL*
moment
I
can
recollect
my
eyes
and
senses
opening
on
London
streets
*NL*
have
known
any
better
life
,
or
kinder
words
than
they
have
given
me
,
so
*NL*
help
me
God
!
Do
not
mind
shrinking
openly
from
me
,
lady
.
I
am
younger
*NL*
than
you
would
think
,
to
look
at
me
,
but
I
am
well
used
to
it
.
The
*NL*
poorest
women
fall
back
,
as
I
make
my
way
along
the
crowded
pavement
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
dreadful
things
are
these
!
'
said
Rose
,
involuntarily
falling
from
*NL*
her
strange
companion
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Thank
Heaven
upon
your
knees
,
dear
lady
,
'
cried
the
girl
,
`
that
you
*NL*
had
friends
to
care
for
and
keep
you
in
your
childhood
,
and
that
you
*NL*
were
never
in
the
midst
of
cold
and
hunger
,
and
riot
and
drunkenness
,
*NL*
and
--
and
--
something
worse
than
all
--
as
I
have
been
from
my
cradle
.
I
*NL*
may
use
the
word
,
for
the
alley
and
the
gutter
were
mine
,
as
they
will
*NL*
be
my
deathbed
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
pity
you
!
'
said
Rose
,
in
a
broken
voice
.
`
It
wrings
my
heart
to
*NL*
hear
you
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Heaven
bless
you
for
your
goodness
!
'
rejoined
the
girl
.
`
If
you
knew
*NL*
what
I
am
sometimes
,
you
would
pity
me
,
indeed
.
But
I
have
stolen
away
*NL*
from
those
who
would
surely
murder
me
,
if
they
knew
I
had
been
here
,
to
*NL*
tell
you
what
I
have
overheard
.
Do
you
know
a
man
named
Monks
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
'
said
Rose
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
knows
you
,
'
replied
the
girl
;
`
and
knew
you
were
here
,
for
it
was
*NL*
by
hearing
him
tell
the
place
that
I
found
you
out
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
never
heard
the
name
,
'
said
Rose
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Then
he
goes
by
some
other
amongst
us
,
'
rejoined
the
girl
,
`
which
I
*NL*
more
than
thought
before
.
Some
time
ago
,
and
soon
after
Oliver
was
put
*NL*
into
your
house
on
the
night
of
the
robbery
,
I
--
suspecting
this
*NL*
man
--
listened
to
a
conversation
held
between
him
and
Fagin
in
the
dark
.
*NL*
I
found
out
,
from
what
I
heard
,
that
Monks
--
the
man
I
asked
you
about
,
*NL*
you
know
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
'
said
Rose
,
'
I
understand
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
--
That
Monks
,
'
pursued
the
girl
,
`
had
seen
him
accidently
with
two
of
*NL*
our
boys
on
the
day
we
first
lost
him
,
and
had
known
him
directly
to
be
*NL*
the
same
child
that
he
was
watching
for
,
though
I
could
n't
make
out
*NL*
why
.
A
bargain
was
struck
with
Fagin
,
that
if
Oliver
was
got
back
he
*NL*
should
have
a
certain
sum
;
and
he
was
to
have
more
for
making
him
a
*NL*
thief
,
which
this
Monks
wanted
for
some
purpose
of
his
own
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
For
what
purpose
?
'
asked
Rose
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
caught
sight
of
my
shadow
on
the
wall
as
I
listened
,
in
the
hope
of
*NL*
finding
out
,
'
said
the
girl
;
`
and
there
are
not
many
people
besides
me
*NL*
that
could
have
got
out
of
their
way
in
time
to
escape
discovery
.
But
*NL*
I
did
;
and
I
saw
him
no
more
till
last
night
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
what
occurred
then
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
'll
tell
you
,
lady
.
Last
night
he
came
again
.
Again
they
went
*NL*
upstairs
,
and
I
,
wrapping
myself
up
so
that
my
shadow
would
not
betray
*NL*
me
,
again
listened
at
the
door
.
The
first
words
I
heard
Monks
say
were
*NL*
these
:
``
So
the
only
proofs
of
the
boy
's
identity
lie
at
the
bottom
of
*NL*
the
river
,
and
the
old
hag
that
received
them
from
the
mother
is
*NL*
rotting
in
her
coffin
.
''
They
laughed
,
and
talked
of
his
success
in
*NL*
doing
this
;
and
Monks
,
talking
on
about
the
boy
,
and
getting
very
wild
,
*NL*
said
that
though
he
had
got
the
young
devil
's
money
safely
now
,
he
'd
*NL*
rather
have
had
it
the
other
way
;
for
,
what
a
game
it
would
have
been
*NL*
to
have
brought
down
the
boast
of
the
father
's
will
,
by
driving
him
*NL*
through
every
jail
in
town
,
and
then
hauling
him
up
for
some
capital
*NL*
felony
which
Fagin
could
easily
manage
,
after
having
made
a
good
profit
*NL*
of
him
besides
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
is
all
this
!
'
said
Rose
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
truth
,
lady
,
though
it
comes
from
my
lips
,
'
replied
the
girl
.
*NL*
`
Then
,
he
said
,
with
oaths
common
enough
in
my
ears
,
but
strange
to
*NL*
yours
,
that
if
he
could
gratify
his
hatred
by
taking
the
boy
's
life
*NL*
without
bringing
his
own
neck
in
danger
,
he
would
;
but
,
as
he
could
n't
,
*NL*
he
'd
be
upon
the
watch
to
meet
him
at
every
turn
in
life
;
and
if
he
*NL*
took
advantage
of
his
birth
and
history
,
he
might
harm
him
yet
.
``
In
*NL*
short
,
Fagin
,
''
he
says
,
``
Jew
as
you
are
,
you
never
laid
such
snares
as
*NL*
I
'll
contrive
for
my
young
brother
,
Oliver
.
''
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
His
brother
!
'
exclaimed
Rose
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Those
were
his
words
,
'
said
Nancy
,
glancing
uneasily
round
,
as
she
had
*NL*
scarcely
ceased
to
do
,
since
she
began
to
speak
,
for
a
vision
of
Sikes
*NL*
haunted
her
perpetually
.
`
And
more
.
When
he
spoke
of
you
and
the
other
*NL*
lady
,
and
said
it
seemed
contrived
by
Heaven
,
or
the
devil
,
against
*NL*
him
,
that
Oliver
should
come
into
your
hands
,
he
laughed
,
and
said
*NL*
there
was
some
comfort
in
that
too
,
for
how
many
thousands
and
hundreds
*NL*
of
thousands
of
pounds
would
you
not
give
,
if
you
had
them
,
to
know
who
*NL*
your
two-legged
spaniel
was
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
do
not
mean
,
'
said
Rose
,
turning
very
pale
,
`
to
tell
me
that
this
*NL*
was
said
in
earnest
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
spoke
in
hard
and
angry
earnest
,
if
a
man
ever
did
,
'
replied
the
*NL*
girl
,
shaking
her
head
.
`
He
is
an
earnest
man
when
his
hatred
is
up
.
*NL*
I
know
many
who
do
worse
things
;
but
I
'd
rather
listen
to
them
all
a
*NL*
dozen
times
,
than
to
that
Monks
once
.
It
is
growing
late
,
and
I
have
*NL*
to
reach
home
without
suspicion
of
having
been
on
such
an
errand
as
*NL*
this
.
I
must
get
back
quickly
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
what
can
I
do
?
'
said
Rose
.
`
To
what
use
can
I
turn
this
*NL*
communication
without
you
?
Back
!
Why
do
you
wish
to
return
to
*NL*
companions
you
paint
in
such
terrible
colors
?
If
you
repeat
this
*NL*
information
to
a
gentleman
whom
I
can
summon
in
an
instant
from
the
*NL*
next
room
,
you
can
be
consigned
to
some
place
of
safety
without
half
an
*NL*
hour
's
delay
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
wish
to
go
back
,
'
said
the
girl
.
'
I
must
go
back
,
because
--
how
can
*NL*
I
tell
such
things
to
an
innocent
lady
like
you
?
--
because
among
the
men
*NL*
I
have
told
you
of
,
there
is
one
:
the
most
desperate
among
them
all
;
*NL*
that
I
ca
n't
leave
:
no
,
not
even
to
be
saved
from
the
life
I
am
*NL*
leading
now
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Your
having
interfered
in
this
dear
boy
's
behalf
before
,
'
said
Rose
;
*NL*
`
your
coming
here
,
at
so
great
a
risk
,
to
tell
me
what
you
have
heard
;
*NL*
your
manner
,
which
convinces
me
of
the
truth
of
what
you
say
;
your
*NL*
evident
contrition
,
and
sense
of
shame
;
all
lead
me
to
believe
that
you
*NL*
might
yet
be
reclaimed
.
Oh
!
'
said
the
earnest
girl
,
folding
her
hands
*NL*
as
the
tears
coursed
down
her
face
,
`
do
not
turn
a
deaf
ear
to
the
*NL*
entreaties
of
one
of
your
own
sex
;
the
first
--
the
first
,
I
do
believe
,
*NL*
who
ever
appealed
to
you
in
the
voice
of
pity
and
compassion
.
Do
hear
*NL*
my
words
,
and
let
me
save
you
yet
,
for
better
things
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Lady
,
'
cried
the
girl
,
sinking
on
her
knees
,
`
dear
,
sweet
,
angel
lady
,
*NL*
you
_
are
_
the
first
that
ever
blessed
me
with
such
words
as
these
,
and
*NL*
if
I
had
heard
them
years
ago
,
they
might
have
turned
me
from
a
life
of
*NL*
sin
and
sorrow
;
but
it
is
too
late
,
it
is
too
late
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
is
never
too
late
,
'
said
Rose
,
`
for
penitence
and
atonement
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
is
,
'
cried
the
girl
,
writhing
in
agony
of
her
mind
;
'
I
can
not
leave
*NL*
him
now
!
I
could
not
be
his
death
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
should
you
be
?
'
asked
Rose
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Nothing
could
save
him
,
'
cried
the
girl
.
`
If
I
told
others
what
I
*NL*
have
told
you
,
and
led
to
their
being
taken
,
he
would
be
sure
to
die
.
*NL*
He
is
the
boldest
,
and
has
been
so
cruel
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Is
it
possible
,
'
cried
Rose
,
`
that
for
such
a
man
as
this
,
you
can
*NL*
resign
every
future
hope
,
and
the
certainty
of
immediate
rescue
?
It
is
*NL*
madness
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
do
n't
know
what
it
is
,
'
answered
the
girl
;
'
I
only
know
that
it
is
*NL*
so
,
and
not
with
me
alone
,
but
with
hundreds
of
others
as
bad
and
*NL*
wretched
as
myself
.
I
must
go
back
.
Whether
it
is
God
's
wrath
for
the
*NL*
wrong
I
have
done
,
I
do
not
know
;
but
I
am
drawn
back
to
him
through
*NL*
every
suffering
and
ill
usage
;
and
I
should
be
,
I
believe
,
if
I
knew
*NL*
that
I
was
to
die
by
his
hand
at
last
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
am
I
to
do
?
'
said
Rose
.
'
I
should
not
let
you
depart
from
me
*NL*
thus
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
should
,
lady
,
and
I
know
you
will
,
'
rejoined
the
girl
,
rising
.
*NL*
`
You
will
not
stop
my
going
because
I
have
trusted
in
your
goodness
,
*NL*
and
forced
no
promise
from
you
,
as
I
might
have
done
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Of
what
use
,
then
,
is
the
communication
you
have
made
?
'
said
Rose
.
*NL*
`
This
mystery
must
be
investigated
,
or
how
will
its
disclosure
to
me
,
*NL*
benefit
Oliver
,
whom
you
are
anxious
to
serve
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
must
have
some
kind
gentleman
about
you
that
will
hear
it
as
a
*NL*
secret
,
and
advise
you
what
to
do
,
'
rejoined
the
girl
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
where
can
I
find
you
again
when
it
is
necessary
?
'
asked
Rose
.
'
I
*NL*
do
not
seek
to
know
where
these
dreadful
people
live
,
but
where
will
*NL*
you
be
walking
or
passing
at
any
settled
period
from
this
time
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Will
you
promise
me
that
you
will
have
my
secret
strictly
kept
,
and
*NL*
come
alone
,
or
with
the
only
other
person
that
knows
it
;
and
that
I
*NL*
shall
not
be
watched
or
followed
?
'
asked
the
girl
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
promise
you
solemnly
,
'
answered
Rose
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Every
Sunday
night
,
from
eleven
until
the
clock
strikes
twelve
,
'
said
*NL*
the
girl
without
hesitation
,
'
I
will
walk
on
London
Bridge
if
I
am
*NL*
alive
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Stay
another
moment
,
'
interposed
Rose
,
as
the
girl
moved
hurriedly
*NL*
towards
the
door
.
`
Think
once
again
on
your
own
condition
,
and
the
*NL*
opportunity
you
have
of
escaping
from
it
.
You
have
a
claim
on
me
:
not
*NL*
only
as
the
voluntary
bearer
of
this
intelligence
,
but
as
a
woman
lost
*NL*
almost
beyond
redemption
.
Will
you
return
to
this
gang
of
robbers
,
and
*NL*
to
this
man
,
when
a
word
can
save
you
?
What
fascination
is
it
that
can
*NL*
take
you
back
,
and
make
you
cling
to
wickedness
and
misery
?
Oh
!
is
*NL*
there
no
chord
in
your
heart
that
I
can
touch
!
Is
there
nothing
left
,
*NL*
to
which
I
can
appeal
against
this
terrible
infatuation
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
When
ladies
as
young
,
and
good
,
and
beautiful
as
you
are
,
'
replied
the
*NL*
girl
steadily
,
`
give
away
your
hearts
,
love
will
carry
you
all
*NL*
lengths
--
even
such
as
you
,
who
have
home
,
friends
,
other
admirers
,
*NL*
everything
,
to
fill
them
.
When
such
as
I
,
who
have
no
certain
roof
but
*NL*
the
coffinlid
,
and
no
friend
in
sickness
or
death
but
the
hospital
*NL*
nurse
,
set
our
rotten
hearts
on
any
man
,
and
let
him
fill
the
place
*NL*
that
has
been
a
blank
through
all
our
wretched
lives
,
who
can
hope
to
*NL*
cure
us
?
Pity
us
,
lady
--
pity
us
for
having
only
one
feeling
of
the
*NL*
woman
left
,
and
for
having
that
turned
,
by
a
heavy
judgment
,
from
a
*NL*
comfort
and
a
pride
,
into
a
new
means
of
violence
and
suffering
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
will
,
'
said
Rose
,
after
a
pause
,
`
take
some
money
from
me
,
which
*NL*
may
enable
you
to
live
without
dishonesty
--
at
all
events
until
we
meet
*NL*
again
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Not
a
penny
,
'
replied
the
girl
,
waving
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Do
not
close
your
heart
against
all
my
efforts
to
help
you
,
'
said
*NL*
Rose
,
stepping
gently
forward
.
'
I
wish
to
serve
you
indeed
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
would
serve
me
best
,
lady
,
'
replied
the
girl
,
wringing
her
hands
,
*NL*
`
if
you
could
take
my
life
at
once
;
for
I
have
felt
more
grief
to
think
*NL*
of
what
I
am
,
to-night
,
than
I
ever
did
before
,
and
it
would
be
*NL*
something
not

the
hell
in
which
I
have
lived

God
bless
you
,
*NL*
sweet
lady
,

send
as
much
happiness
on
your
head

I

brought

shame
on
mine

'
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
speaking
,
and
sobbing
aloud
,
the
unhappy
creature
turned
away
;
*NL*
while
Rose
Maylie
,
overpowered
by
this
extraordinary
interview
,
which
*NL*
had
more
the
semblance
of
a
rapid
dream
than
an
actual
occurrence
,
sank
*NL*
into
a
chair
,
and
endeavoured
to
collect
her
wandering
thoughts
.

CHAPTER
XLI
*NL*
*NL*
CONTAINING
FRESH
DISCOVERIES
,
AND
SHOWING
THAT
SUPRISES
,
LIKE
*NL*
MISFORTUNES
,
SELDOM
COME
ALONE
*NL*
*NL*
Her
situation
was
,
indeed
,
one
of
no
common
trial
and
difficulty
.
While
*NL*
she
felt
the
most
eager
and
burning
desire
to
penetrate
the
mystery
in
*NL*
which
Oliver
's
history
was
enveloped
,
she
could
not
but
hold
sacred
the
*NL*
confidence
which
the
miserable
woman
with
whom
she
had
just
conversed
,
*NL*
had
reposed
in
her
,
as
a
young
and
guileless
girl
.
Her
words
and
*NL*
manner
had
touched
Rose
Maylie
's
heart
;
and
,
mingled
with
her
love
for
*NL*
her
young
charge
,
and
scarcely
less
intense
in
its
truth
and
fervour
,
*NL*
was
her
fond
wish
to
win
the
outcast
back
to
repentance
and
hope
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
purposed
remaining
in
London
only
three
days
,
prior
to
departing
*NL*
for
some
weeks
to
a
distant
part
of
the
coast
.
It
was
now
midnight
of
*NL*
the
first
day
.
What
course
of
action
could
she
determine
upon
,
which
*NL*
could
be
adopted
in
eight-and-forty
hours
?
Or
how
could
she
postpone
*NL*
the
journey
without
exciting
suspicion
?
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Losberne
was
with
them
,
and
would
be
for
the
next
two
days
;
but
*NL*
Rose
was
too
well
acquainted
with
the
excellent
gentleman
's
*NL*
impetuosity
,
and
foresaw
too
clearly
the
wrath
with
which
,
in
the
first
*NL*
explosion
of
his
indignation
,
he
would
regard
the
instrument
of
*NL*
Oliver
's
recapture
,
to
trust
him
with
the
secret
,
when
her
*NL*
representations
in
the
girl
's
behalf
could
be
seconded
by
no
*NL*
experienced
person
.
These
were
all
reasons
for
the
greatest
caution
*NL*
and
most
circumspect
behaviour
in
communicating
it
to
Mrs.
Maylie
,
*NL*
whose
first
impulse
would
infallibly
be
to
hold
a
conference
with
the
*NL*
worthy
doctor
on
the
subject
.
As
to
resorting
to
any
legal
adviser
,
*NL*
even
if
she
had
known
how
to
do
so
,
it
was
scarcely
to
be
thought
of
,
*NL*
for
the
same
reason
.
Once
the
thought
occurred
to
her
of
seeking
*NL*
assistance
from
Harry
;
but
this
awakened
the
recollection
of
their
last
*NL*
parting
,
and
it
seemed
unworthy
of
her
to
call
him
back
,
when
--
the
*NL*
tears
rose
to
her
eyes
as
she
pursued
this
train
of
reflection
--
he
*NL*
might
have
by
this
time
learnt
to
forget
her
,
and
to
be
happier
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
Disturbed
by
these
different
reflections
;
inclining
now
to
one
course
*NL*
and
then
to
another
,
and
again
recoiling
from
all
,
as
each
successive
*NL*
consideration
presented
itself
to
her
mind
;
Rose
passed
a
sleepless
and
*NL*
anxious
night
.
After
more
communing
with
herself
next
day
,
she
arrived
*NL*
at
the
desperate
conclusion
of
consulting
Harry
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
If
it
be
painful
to
him
,
'
she
thought
,
`
to
come
back
here
,
how
painful
*NL*
it
will
be
to
me
!
But
perhaps
he
will
not
come
;
he
may
write
,
or
he
*NL*
may
come
himself
,
and
studiously
abstain
from
meeting
me
--
he
did
when
*NL*
he
went
away
.
I
hardly
thought
he
would
;
but
it
was
better
for
us
*NL*
both
.
'
And
here
Rose
dropped
the
pen
,
and
turned
away
,
as
though
the
*NL*
very
paper
which
was
to
be
her
messenger
should
not
see
her
weep
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
taken
up
the
same
pen
,
and
laid
it
down
again
fifty
times
,
and
*NL*
had
considered
and
reconsidered
the
first
line
of
her
letter
without
*NL*
writing
the
first
word
,
when
Oliver
,
who
had
been
walking
in
the
*NL*
streets
,
with
Mr.
Giles
for
a
body-guard
,
entered
the
room
in
such
*NL*
breathless
haste
and
violent
agitation
,
as
seemed
to
betoken
some
new
*NL*
cause
of
alarm
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
makes
you
look
so
flurried
?
'
asked
Rose
,
advancing
to
meet
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
hardly
know
how
;
I
feel
as
if
I
should
be
choked
,
'
replied
the
boy
.
*NL*
`
Oh
dear
!
To
think
that
I
should
see
him
at
last
,
and
you
should
be
*NL*
able
to
know
that
I
have
told
you
the
truth
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
never
thought
you
had
told
us
anything
but
the
truth
,
'
said
Rose
,
*NL*
soothing
him
.
`
But
what
is
this
?
--
of
whom
do
you
speak
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
have
seen
the
gentleman
,
'
replied
Oliver
,
scarcely
able
to
*NL*
articulate
,
`
the
gentleman
who
was
so
good
to
me
--
Mr.
Brownlow
,
that
we
*NL*
have
so
often
talked
about
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Where
?
'
asked
Rose
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Getting
out
of
a
coach
,
'
replied
Oliver
,
shedding
tears
of
delight
,
*NL*
`
and
going
into
a
house
.
I
did
n't
speak
to
him
--
I
could
n't
speak
to
*NL*
him
,
for
he
did
n't
see
me
,
and
I
trembled
so
,
that
I
was
not
able
to
go
*NL*
up
to
him
.
But
Giles
asked
,
for
me
,
whether
he
lived
there
,
and
they
*NL*
said
he
did
.
Look
here
,
'
said
Oliver
,
opening
a
scrap
of
paper
,
`
here
*NL*
it
is
;
here
's
where
he
lives
--
I
'm
going
there
directly
!
Oh
,
dear
me
,
*NL*
dear
me
!
What
shall
I
do
when
I
come
to
see
him
and
hear
him
speak
*NL*
again
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
With
her
attention
not
a
little
distracted
by
these
and
a
great
many
*NL*
other
incoherent
exclamations
of
joy
,
Rose
read
the
address
,
which
was
*NL*
Craven
Street
,
in
the
Strand
.
She
very
soon
determined
upon
turning
*NL*
the
discovery
to
account
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Quick
!
'
she
said
.
`
Tell
them
to
fetch
a
hackney-coach
,
and
be
ready
*NL*
to
go
with
me
.
I
will
take
you
there
directly
,
without
a
minute
's
loss
*NL*
of
time
.
I
will
only
tell
my
aunt
that
we
are
going
out
for
an
hour
,
*NL*
and
be
ready
as
soon
as
you
are
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Oliver
needed
no
prompting
to
despatch
,
and
in
little
more
than
five
*NL*
minutes
they
were
on
their
way
to
Craven
Street
.
When
they
arrived
*NL*
there
,
Rose
left
Oliver
in
the
coach
,
under
pretence
of
preparing
the
*NL*
old
gentleman
to
receive
him
;
and
sending
up
her
card
by
the
servant
,
*NL*
requested
to
see
Mr.
Brownlow
on
very
pressing
business
.
The
servant
*NL*
soon
returned
,
to
beg
that
she
would
walk
upstairs
;
and
following
him
*NL*
into
an
upper
room
,
Miss
Maylie
was
presented
to
an
elderly
gentleman
*NL*
of
benevolent
appearance
,
in
a
bottle-green
coat
.
At
no
great
distance
*NL*
from
whom
,
was
seated
another
old
gentleman
,
in
nankeen
breeches
and
*NL*
gaiters
;
who
did
not
look
particularly
benevolent
,
and
who
was
sitting
*NL*
with
his
hands
clasped
on
the
top
of
a
thick
stick
,
and
his
chin
*NL*
propped
thereupon
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Dear
me
,
'
said
the
gentleman
,
in
the
bottle-green
coat
,
hastily
rising
*NL*
with
great
politeness
,
'
I
beg
your
pardon
,
young
lady
--
I
imagined
it
*NL*
was
some
importunate
person
who
--
I
beg
you
will
excuse
me
.
Be
seated
,
*NL*
pray
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Mr.
Brownlow
,
I
believe
,
sir
?
'
said
Rose
,
glancing
from
the
other
*NL*
gentleman
to
the
one
who
had
spoken
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
is
my
name
,
'
said
the
old
gentleman
.
`
This
is
my
friend
,
Mr.
*NL*
Grimwig
.
Grimwig
,
will
you
leave
us
for
a
few
minutes
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
believe
,
'
interposed
Miss
Maylie
,
`
that
at
this
period
of
our
*NL*
interview
,
I
need
not
give
that
gentleman
the
trouble
of
going
away
.
*NL*
If
I
am
correctly
informed
,
he
is
cognizant
of
the
business
on
which
I
*NL*
wish
to
speak
to
you
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Brownlow
inclined
his
head
.
Mr.
Grimwig
,
who
had
made
one
very
*NL*
stiff
bow
,
and
risen
from
his
chair
,
made
another
very
stiff
bow
,
and
*NL*
dropped
into
it
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
shall
surprise
you
very
much
,
I
have
no
doubt
,
'
said
Rose
,
naturally
*NL*
embarrassed
;
`
but
you
once
showed
great
benevolence
and
goodness
to
a
*NL*
very
dear
young
friend
of
mine
,
and
I
am
sure
you
will
take
an
interest
*NL*
in
hearing
of
him
again
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Indeed
!
'
said
Mr.
Brownlow
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oliver
Twist
you
knew
him
as
,
'
replied
Rose
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
words
no
sooner
escaped
her
lips
,
than
Mr.
Grimwig
,
who
had
been
*NL*
affecting
to
dip
into
a
large
book
that
lay
on
the
table
,
upset
it
with
*NL*
a
great
crash
,
and
falling
back
in
his
chair
,
discharged
from
his
*NL*
features
every
expression
but
one
of
unmitigated
wonder
,
and
indulged
*NL*
in
a
prolonged
and
vacant
stare
;
then
,
as
if
ashamed
of
having
betrayed
*NL*
so
much
emotion
,
he
jerked
himself
,
as
it
were
,
by
a
convulsion
into
*NL*
his
former
attitude
,
and
looking
out
straight
before
him
emitted
a
long
*NL*
deep
whistle
,
which
seemed
,
at
last
,
not
to
be
discharged
on
empty
air
,
*NL*
but
to
die
away
in
the
innermost
recesses
of
his
stomach
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Browlow
was
no
less
surprised
,
although
his
astonishment
was
not
*NL*
expressed
in
the
same
eccentric
manner
.
He
drew
his
chair
nearer
to
*NL*
Miss
Maylie
's
,
and
said
,
*NL*
*NL*
`
Do
me
the
favour
,
my
dear
young
lady
,
to
leave
entirely
out
of
the
*NL*
question
that
goodness
and
benevolence
of
which
you
speak
,
and
of
which
*NL*
nobody
else
knows
anything
;
and
if
you
have
it
in
your
power
to
produce
*NL*
any
evidence
which
will
alter
the
unfavourable
opinion
I
was
once
*NL*
induced
to
entertain
of
that
poor
child
,
in
Heaven
's
name
put
me
in
*NL*
possession
of
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
A
bad
one
!
I
'll
eat
my
head
if
he
is
not
a
bad
one
,
'
growled
Mr.
*NL*
Grimwig
,
speaking
by
some
ventriloquial
power
,
without
moving
a
muscle
*NL*
of
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
is
a
child
of
a
noble
nature
and
a
warm
heart
,
'
said
Rose
,
*NL*
colouring
;
`
and
that
Power
which
has
thought
fit
to
try
him
beyond
his
*NL*
years
,
has
planted
in
his
breast
affections
and
feelings
which
would
do
*NL*
honour
to
many
who
have
numbered
his
days
six
times
over
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
'm
only
sixty-one
,
'
said
Mr.
Grimwig
,
with
the
same
rigid
face
.
`
And
,
*NL*
as
the
devil
's
in
it
if
this
Oliver
is
not
twelve
years
old
at
least
,
I
*NL*
do
n't
see
the
application
of
that
remark
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Do
not
heed
my
friend
,
Miss
Maylie
,
'
said
Mr.
Brownlow
;
`
he
does
not
*NL*
mean
what
he
says
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
he
does
,
'
growled
Mr.
Grimwig
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
he
does
not
,
'
said
Mr.
Brownlow
,
obviously
rising
in
wrath
as
he
*NL*
spoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
'll
eat
his
head
,
if
he
does
n't
,
'
growled
Mr.
Grimwig
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
would
deserve
to
have
it
knocked
off
,
if
he
does
,
'
said
Mr.
*NL*
Brownlow
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
he
'd
uncommonly
like
to
see
any
man
offer
to
do
it
,
'
responded
Mr.
*NL*
Grimwig
,
knocking
his
stick
upon
the
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
gone
thus
far
,
the
two
old
gentlemen
severally
took
snuff
,
and
*NL*
afterwards
shook
hands
,
according
to
their
invariable
custom
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Now
,
Miss
Maylie
,
'
said
Mr.
Brownlow
,
`
to
return
to
the
subject
in
*NL*
which
your
humanity
is
so
much
interested
.
Will
you
let
me
know
what
*NL*
intelligence
you
have
of
this
poor
child
:
allowing
me
to
promise
that
*NL*
I
exhausted
every
means
in
my
power
of
discovering
him
,
and
that
since
*NL*
I
have
been
absent
from
this
country
,
my
first
impression
that
he
had
*NL*
imposed
upon
me
,
and
had
been
persuaded
by
his
former
associates
to
rob
*NL*
me
,
has
been
considerably
shaken
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Rose
,
who
had
had
time
to
collect
her
thoughts
,
at
once
related
,
in
a
*NL*
few
natural
words
,
all
that
had
befallen
Oliver
since
he
left
Mr.
*NL*
Brownlow
's
house
;
reserving
Nancy
's
information
for
that
gentleman
's
*NL*
private
ear
,
and
concluding
with
the
assurance
that
his
only
sorrow
,
*NL*
for
some
months
past
,
had
been
not
being
able
to
meet
with
his
former
*NL*
benefactor
and
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Thank
God
!
'
said
the
old
gentleman
.
`
This
is
great
happiness
to
me
,
*NL*
great
happiness
.
But
you
have
not
told
me
where
he
is
now
,
Miss
*NL*
Maylie
.
You
must
pardon
my
finding
fault
with
you
,
--
but
why
not
have
*NL*
brought
him
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
is
waiting
in
a
coach
at
the
door
,
'
replied
Rose
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
At
this
door
!
'
cried
the
old
gentleman
.
With
which
he
hurried
out
of
*NL*
the
room
,
down
the
stairs
,
up
the
coachsteps
,
and
into
the
coach
,
*NL*
without
another
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
room-door
closed
behind
him
,
Mr.
Grimwig
lifted
up
his
head
,
*NL*
and
converting
one
of
the
hind
legs
of
his
chair
into
a
pivot
,
*NL*
described
three
distinct
circles
with
the
assistance
of
his
stick
and
*NL*
the
table
;
sitting
in
it
all
the
time
.
After
performing
this
*NL*
evolution
,
he
rose
and
limped
as
fast
as
he
could
up
and
down
the
room
*NL*
at
least
a
dozen
times
,
and
then
stopping
suddenly
before
Rose
,
kissed
*NL*
her
without
the
slightest
preface
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Hush
!
'
he
said
,
as
the
young
lady
rose
in
some
alarm
at
this
unusual
*NL*
proceeding
.
`
Do
n't
be
afraid
.
I
'm
old
enough
to
be
your
grandfather
.
*NL*
You
're
a
sweet
girl
.
I
like
you
.
Here
they
are
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
In
fact
,
as
he
threw
himself
at
one
dexterous
dive
into
his
former
*NL*
seat
,
Mr.
Brownlow
returned
,
accompanied
by
Oliver
,
whom
Mr.
Grimwig
*NL*
received
very
graciously
;
and
if
the
gratification
of
that
moment
had
*NL*
been
the
only
reward
for
all
her
anxiety
and
care
in
Oliver
's
behalf
,
*NL*
Rose
Maylie
would
have
been
well
repaid
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
There
is
somebody
else
who
should
not
be
forgotten
,
by
the
bye
,
'
said
*NL*
Mr.
Brownlow
,
ringing
the
bell
.
`
Send
Mrs.
Bedwin
here
,
if
you
please
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
housekeeper
answered
the
summons
with
all
dispatch
;
and
*NL*
dropping
a
curtsey
at
the
door
,
waited
for
orders
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
you
get
blinder
every
day
,
Bedwin
,
'
said
Mr.
Brownlow
,
rather
*NL*
testily
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
that
I
do
,
sir
,
'
replied
the
old
lady
.
`
People
's
eyes
,
at
my
*NL*
time
of
life
,
do
n't
improve
with
age
,
sir
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
could
have
told
you
that
,
'
rejoined
Mr.
Brownlow
;
`
but
put
on
your
*NL*
glasses
,
and
see
if
you
ca
n't
find
out
what
you
were
wanted
for
,
will
*NL*
you
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
lady
began
to
rummage
in
her
pocket
for
her
spectacles
.
But
*NL*
Oliver
's
patience
was
not
proof
against
this
new
trial
;
and
yielding
to
*NL*
his
first
impulse
,
he
sprang
into
her
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
God
be
good
to
me
!
'
cried
the
old
lady
,
embracing
him
;
`
it
is
my
*NL*
innocent
boy
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
My
dear
old
nurse
!
'
cried
Oliver
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
would
come
back
--
I
knew
he
would
,
'
said
the
old
lady
,
holding
him
*NL*
in
her
arms
.
`
How
well
he
looks
,
and
how
like
a
gentleman
's
son
he
is
*NL*
dressed
again
!
Where
have
you
been
,
this
long
,
long
while
?
Ah
!
the
*NL*
same
sweet
face
,
but
not
so
pale
;
the
same
soft
eye
,
but
not
so
sad
.
I
*NL*
have
never
forgotten
them
or
his
quiet
smile
,
but
have
seen
them
every
*NL*
day
,
side
by
side
with
those
of
my
own
dear
children
,
dead
and
gone
*NL*
since
I
was
a
lightsome
young
creature
.
'
Running
on
thus
,
and
now
*NL*
holding
Oliver
from
her
to
mark
how
he
had
grown
,
now
clasping
him
to
*NL*
her
and
passing
her
fingers
fondly
through
his
hair
,
the
good
soul
*NL*
laughed
and
wept
upon
his
neck
by
turns
.
*NL*
*NL*
Leaving
her
and
Oliver
to
compare
notes
at
leisure
,
Mr.
Brownlow
led
*NL*
the
way
into
another
room
;
and
there
,
heard
from
Rose
a
full
narration
*NL*
of
her
interview
with
Nancy
,
which
occasioned
him
no
little
surprise
*NL*
and
perplexity
.
Rose
also
explained
her
reasons
for
not
confiding
in
*NL*
her
friend
Mr.
Losberne
in
the
first
instance
.
The
old
gentleman
*NL*
considered
that
she
had
acted
prudently
,
and
readily
undertook
to
hold
*NL*
solemn
conference
with
the
worthy
doctor
himself
.
To
afford
him
an
*NL*
early
opportunity
for
the
execution
of
this
design
,
it
was
arranged
*NL*
that
he
should
call
at
the
hotel
at
eight
o'clock
that
evening
,
and
*NL*
that
in
the
meantime
Mrs.
Maylie
should
be
cautiously
informed
of
all
*NL*
that
had
occurred
.
These
preliminaries
adjusted
,
Rose
and
Oliver
*NL*
returned
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rose
had
by
no
means
overrated
the
measure
of
the
good
doctor
's
wrath
.
*NL*
Nancy
's
history
was
no
sooner
unfolded
to
him
,
than
he
poured
forth
a
*NL*
shower
of
mingled
threats
and
execrations
;
threatened
to
make
her
the
*NL*
first
victim
of
the
combined
ingenuity
of
Messrs.
Blathers
and
Duff
;
*NL*
and
actually
put
on
his
hat
preparatory
to
sallying
forth
to
obtain
the
*NL*
assistance
of
those
worthies
.
And
,
doubtless
,
he
would
,
in
this
first
*NL*
outbreak
,
have
carried
the
intention
into
effect
without
a
moment
's
*NL*
consideration
of
the
consequences
,
if
he
had
not
been
restrained
,
in
*NL*
part
,
by
corresponding
violence
on
the
side
of
Mr.
Brownlow
,
who
was
*NL*
himself
of
an
irascible
temperament
,
and
party
by
such
arguments
and
*NL*
representations
as
seemed
best
calculated
to
dissuade
him
from
his
*NL*
hotbrained
purpose
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Then
what
the
devil
is
to
be
done
?
'
said
the
impetuous
doctor
,
when
*NL*
they
had
rejoined
the
two
ladies
.
`
Are
we
to
pass
a
vote
of
thanks
to
*NL*
all
these
vagabonds
,
male
and
female
,
and
beg
them
to
accept
a
hundred
*NL*
pounds
,
or
so
,
apiece
,
as
a
trifling
mark
of
our
esteem
,
and
some
*NL*
slight
acknowledgment
of
their
kindness
to
Oliver
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Not
exactly
that
,
'
rejoined
Mr.
Brownlow
,
laughing
;
`
but
we
must
*NL*
proceed
gently
and
with
great
care
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Gentleness
and
care
,
'
exclaimed
the
doctor
.
`
I
'd
send
them
one
and
*NL*
all
to
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Never
mind
where
,
'
interposed
Mr.
Brownlow
.
`
But
reflect
whether
*NL*
sending
them
anywhere
is
likely
to
attain
the
object
we
have
in
view
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
object
?
'
asked
the
doctor
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Simply
,
the
discovery
of
Oliver
's
parentage
,
and
regaining
for
him
the
*NL*
inheritance
of
which
,
if
this
story
be
true
,
he
has
been
fraudulently
*NL*
deprived
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ah
!
'
said
Mr.
Losberne
,
cooling
himself
with
his
pocket-handkerchief
;
*NL*
'
I
almost
forgot
that
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
see
,
'
pursued
Mr.
Brownlow
;
`
placing
this
poor
girl
entirely
out
*NL*
of
the
question
,
and
supposing
it
were
possible
to
bring
these
*NL*
scoundrels
to
justice
without
compromising
her
safety
,
what
good
should
*NL*
we
bring
about
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Hanging
a
few
of
them
at
least
,
in
all
probability
,
'
suggested
the
*NL*
doctor
,
`
and
transporting
the
rest
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Very
good
,
'
replied
Mr.
Brownlow
,
smiling
;
`
but
no
doubt
they
will
*NL*
bring
that
about
for
themselves
in
the
fulness
of
time
,
and
if
we
step
*NL*
in
to
forestall
them
,
it
seems
to
me
that
we
shall
be
performing
a
very
*NL*
Quixotic
act
,
in
direct
opposition
to
our
own
interest
--
or
at
least
to
*NL*
Oliver
's
,
which
is
the
same
thing
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
How
?
'
inquired
the
doctor
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Thus
.
It
is
quite
clear
that
we
shall
have
extreme
difficulty
in
*NL*
getting
to
the
bottom
of
this
mystery
,
unless
we
can
bring
this
man
,
*NL*
Monks
,
upon
his
knees
.
That
can
only
be
done
by
stratagem
,
and
by
*NL*
catching
him
when
he
is
not
surrounded
by
these
people
.
For
,
suppose
*NL*
he
were
apprehended
,
we
have
no
proof
against
him
.
He
is
not
even
-LRB-
so
*NL*
far
as
we
know
,
or
as
the
facts
appear
to
us
-RRB-
concerned
with
the
gang
*NL*
in
any
of
their
robberies
.
If
he
were
not
discharged
,
it
is
very
*NL*
unlikely
that
he
could
receive
any
further
punishment
than
being
*NL*
committed
to
prison
as
a
rogue
and
vagabond
;
and
of
course
ever
*NL*
afterwards
his
mouth
would
be
so
obstinately
closed
that
he
might
as
*NL*
well
,
for
our
purposes
,
be
deaf
,
dumb
,
blind
,
and
an
idiot
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Then
,
'
said
the
doctor
impetuously
,
'
I
put
it
to
you
again
,
whether
*NL*
you
think
it
reasonable
that
this
promise
to
the
girl
should
be
*NL*
considered
binding
;
a
promise
made
with
the
best
and
kindest
*NL*
intentions
,
but
really
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Do
not
discuss
the
point
,
my
dear
young
lady
,
pray
,
'
said
Mr.
*NL*
Brownlow
,
interrupting
Rose
as
she
was
about
to
speak
.
`
The
promise
*NL*
shall
be
kept
.
I
do
n't
think
it
will
,
in
the
slightest
degree
,
*NL*
interfere
with
our
proceedings
.
But
,
before
we
can
resolve
upon
any
*NL*
precise
course
of
action
,
it
will
be
necessary
to
see
the
girl
;
to
*NL*
ascertain
from
her
whether
she
will
point
out
this
Monks
,
on
the
*NL*
understanding
that
he
is
to
be
dealt
with
by
us
,
and
not
by
the
law
;
*NL*
or
,
if
she
will
not
,
or
can
not
do
that
,
to
procure
from
her
such
an
*NL*
account
of
his
haunts
and
description
of
his
person
,
as
will
enable
us
*NL*
to
identify
him
.
She
can
not
be
seen
until
next
Sunday
night
;
this
is
*NL*
Tuesday
.
I
would
suggest
that
in
the
meantime
,
we
remain
perfectly
*NL*
quiet
,
and
keep
these
matters
secret
even
from
Oliver
himself
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Although
Mr.
Losberne
received
with
many
wry
faces
a
proposal
involving
*NL*
a
delay
of
five
whole
days
,
he
was
fain
to
admit
that
no
better
course
*NL*
occurred
to
him
just
then
;
and
as
both
Rose
and
Mrs.
Maylie
sided
very
*NL*
strongly
with
Mr.
Brownlow
,
that
gentleman
's
proposition
was
carried
*NL*
unanimously
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
should
like
,
'
he
said
,
`
to
call
in
the
aid
of
my
friend
Grimwig
.
He
*NL*
is
a
strange
creature
,
but
a
shrewd
one
,
and
might
prove
of
material
*NL*
assistance
to
us
;
I
should
say
that
he
was
bred
a
lawyer
,
and
quitted
*NL*
the
Bar
in
disgust
because
he
had
only
one
brief
and
a
motion
of
*NL*
course
,
in
twenty
years
,
though
whether
that
is
recommendation
or
not
,
*NL*
you
must
determine
for
yourselves
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
have
no
objection
to
your
calling
in
your
friend
if
I
may
call
in
*NL*
mine
,
'
said
the
doctor
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
We
must
put
it
to
the
vote
,
'
replied
Mr.
Brownlow
,
`
who
may
he
be
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
lady
's
son
,
and
this
young
lady
's
--
very
old
friend
,
'
said
the
*NL*
doctor
,
motioning
towards
Mrs.
Maylie
,
and
concluding
with
an
*NL*
expressive
glance
at
her
niece
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rose
blushed
deeply
,
but
she
did
not
make
any
audible
objection
to
this
*NL*
motion
-LRB-
possibly
she
felt
in
a
hopeless
minority
-RRB-
;
and
Harry
Maylie
and
*NL*
Mr.
Grimwig
were
accordingly
added
to
the
committee
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
We
stay
in
town
,
of
course
,
'
said
Mrs.
Maylie
,
`
while
there
remains
*NL*
the
slightest
prospect
of
prosecuting
this
inquiry
with
a
chance
of
*NL*
success
.
I
will
spare
neither
trouble
nor
expense
in
behalf
of
the
*NL*
object
in
which
we
are
all
so
deeply
interested
,
and
I
am
content
to
*NL*
remain
here
,
if
it
be
for
twelve
months
,
so
long
as
you
assure
me
that
*NL*
any
hope
remains
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Good
!
'
rejoined
Mr.
Brownlow
.
`
And
as
I
see
on
the
faces
about
me
,
a
*NL*
disposition
to
inquire
how
it
happened
that
I
was
not
in
the
way
to
*NL*
corroborate
Oliver
's
tale
,
and
had
so
suddenly
left
the
kingdom
,
let
me
*NL*
stipulate
that
I
shall
be
asked
no
questions
until
such
time
as
I
may
*NL*
deem
it
expedient
to
forestall
them
by
telling
my
own
story
.
Believe
*NL*
me
,
I
make
this
request
with
good
reason
,
for
I
might
otherwise
excite
*NL*
hopes
destined
never
to
be
realised
,
and
only
increase
difficulties
and
*NL*
disappointments
already
quite
numerous
enough
.
Come
!
Supper
has
been
*NL*
announced
,
and
young
Oliver
,
who
is
all
alone
in
the
next
room
,
will
*NL*
have
begun
to
think
,
by
this
time
,
that
we
have
wearied
of
his
company
,
*NL*
and
entered
into
some
dark
conspiracy
to
thrust
him
forth
upon
the
*NL*
world
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
With
these
words
,
the
old
gentleman
gave
his
hand
to
Mrs.
Maylie
,
and
*NL*
escorted
her
into
the
supper-room
.
Mr.
Losberne
followed
,
leading
*NL*
Rose
;
and
the
council
was
,
for
the
present
,
effectually
broken
up

CHAPTER
XLII
*NL*
*NL*
AN
OLD
ACQUAINTANCE
OF
OLIVER
'S
,
EXHIBITING
DECIDED
MARKS
OF
GENIUS
,
*NL*
BECOMES
A
PUBLIC
CHARACTER
IN
THE
METROPOLIS
*NL*
*NL*
Upon
the
night
when
Nancy
,
having
lulled
Mr.
Sikes
to
sleep
,
hurried
on
*NL*
her
self-imposed
mission
to
Rose
Maylie
,
there
advanced
towards
London
,
*NL*
by
the
Great
North
Road
,
two
persons
,
upon
whom
it
is
expedient
that
*NL*
this
history
should
bestow
some
attention
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
a
man
and
woman
;
or
perhaps
they
would
be
better
described
as
*NL*
a
male
and
female
:
for
the
former
was
one
of
those
long-limbed
,
*NL*
knock-kneed
,
shambling
,
bony
people
,
to
whom
it
is
difficult
to
assign
*NL*
any
precise
age
,
--
looking
as
they
do
,
when
they
are
yet
boys
,
like
*NL*
undergrown
men
,
and
when
they
are
almost
men
,
like
overgrown
boys
.
The
*NL*
woman
was
young
,
but
of
a
robust
and
hardy
make
,
as
she
need
have
been
*NL*
to
bear
the
weight
of
the
heavy
bundle
which
was
strapped
to
her
back
.
*NL*
Her
companion
was
not
encumbered
with
much
luggage
,
as
there
merely
*NL*
dangled
from
a
stick
which
he
carried
over
his
shoulder
,
a
small
parcel
*NL*
wrapped
in
a
common
handkerchief
,
and
apparently
light
enough
.
This
*NL*
circumstance
,
added
to
the
length
of
his
legs
,
which
were
of
unusual
*NL*
extent
,
enabled
him
with
much
ease
to
keep
some
half-dozen
paces
in
*NL*
advance
of
his
companion
,
to
whom
he
occasionally
turned
with
an
*NL*
impatient
jerk
of
the
head
:
as
if
reproaching
her
tardiness
,
and
*NL*
urging
her
to
greater
exertion
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
,
they
had
toiled
along
the
dusty
road
,
taking
little
heed
of
any
*NL*
object
within
sight
,
save
when
they
stepped
aside
to
allow
a
wider
*NL*
passage
for
the
mail-coaches
which
were
whirling
out
of
town
,
until
*NL*
they
passed
through
Highgate
archway
;
when
the
foremost
traveller
*NL*
stopped
and
called
impatiently
to
his
companion
,
*NL*
*NL*
`
Come
on
,
ca
n't
yer
?
What
a
lazybones
yer
are
,
Charlotte
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
's
a
heavy
load
,
I
can
tell
you
,
'
said
the
female
,
coming
up
,
almost
*NL*
breathless
with
fatigue
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Heavy
!
What
are
yer
talking
about
?
What
are
yer
made
for
?
'
rejoined
*NL*
the
male
traveller
,
changing
his
own
little
bundle
as
he
spoke
,
to
the
*NL*
other
shoulder
.
`
Oh
,
there
yer
are
,
resting
again
!
Well
,
if
yer
ai
n't
*NL*
enough
to
tire
anybody
's
patience
out
,
I
do
n't
know
what
is
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Is
it
much
farther
?
'
asked
the
woman
,
resting
herself
against
a
bank
,
*NL*
and
looking
up
with
the
perspiration
streaming
from
her
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Much
farther
!
Yer
as
good
as
there
,
'
said
the
long-legged
tramper
,
*NL*
pointing
out
before
him
.
`
Look
there
!
Those
are
the
lights
of
London
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
They
're
a
good
two
mile
off
,
at
least
,
'
said
the
woman
despondingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Never
mind
whether
they
're
two
mile
off
,
or
twenty
,
'
said
Noah
*NL*
Claypole
;
for
he
it
was
;
`
but
get
up
and
come
on
,
or
I
'll
kick
yer
,
and
*NL*
so
I
give
yer
notice
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
As
Noah
's
red
nose
grew
redder
with
anger
,
and
as
he
crossed
the
road
*NL*
while
speaking
,
as
if
fully
prepared
to
put
his
threat
into
execution
,
*NL*
the
woman
rose
without
any
further
remark
,
and
trudged
onward
by
his
*NL*
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Where
do
you
mean
to
stop
for
the
night
,
Noah
?
'
she
asked
,
after
they
*NL*
had
walked
a
few
hundred
yards
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
How
should
I
know
?
'
replied
Noah
,
whose
temper
had
been
considerably
*NL*
impaired
by
walking
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Near
,
I
hope
,
'
said
Charlotte
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
not
near
,
'
replied
Mr.
Claypole
.
`
There
!
Not
near
;
so
do
n't
*NL*
think
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
not
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
When
I
tell
yer
that
I
do
n't
mean
to
do
a
thing
,
that
's
enough
,
*NL*
without
any
why
or
because
either
,
'
replied
Mr.
Claypole
with
dignity
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
you
need
n't
be
so
cross
,
'
said
his
companion
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
A
pretty
thing
it
would
be
,
would
n't
it
to
go
and
stop
at
the
very
*NL*
first
public-house
outside
the
town
,
so
that
Sowerberry
,
if
he
come
up
*NL*
after
us
,
might
poke
in
his
old
nose
,
and
have
us
taken
back
in
a
cart
*NL*
with
handcuffs
on
,
'
said
Mr.
Claypole
in
a
jeering
tone
.
`
No
!
I
shall
*NL*
go
and
lose
myself
among
the
narrowest
streets
I
can
find
,
and
not
stop
*NL*
till
we
come
to
the
very
out-of-the-wayest
house
I
can
set
eyes
on
.
*NL*
`
Cod
,
yer
may
thanks
yer
stars
I
've
got
a
head
;
for
if
we
had
n't
gone
,
*NL*
at
first
,
the
wrong
road
a
purpose
,
and
come
back
across
country
,
yer
'd
*NL*
have
been
locked
up
hard
and
fast
a
week
ago
,
my
lady
.
And
serve
yer
*NL*
right
for
being
a
fool
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
know
I
ai
n't
as
cunning
as
you
are
,
'
replied
Charlotte
;
`
but
do
n't
*NL*
put
all
the
blame
on
me
,
and
say
I
should
have
been
locked
up
.
You
*NL*
would
have
been
if
I
had
been
,
any
way
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yer
took
the
money
from
the
till
,
yer
know
yer
did
,
'
said
Mr.
Claypole
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
took
it
for
you
,
Noah
,
dear
,
'
rejoined
Charlotte
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Did
I
keep
it
?
'
asked
Mr.
Claypole
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
;
you
trusted
in
me
,
and
let
me
carry
it
like
a
dear
,
and
so
you
*NL*
are
,
'
said
the
lady
,
chucking
him
under
the
chin
,
and
drawing
her
arm
*NL*
through
his
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
indeed
the
case
;
but
as
it
was
not
Mr.
Claypole
's
habit
to
*NL*
repose
a
blind
and
foolish
confidence
in
anybody
,
it
should
be
*NL*
observed
,
in
justice
to
that
gentleman
,
that
he
had
trusted
Charlotte
*NL*
to
this
extent
,
in
order
that
,
if
they
were
pursued
,
the
money
might
be
*NL*
found
on
her
:
which
would
leave
him
an
opportunity
of
asserting
his
*NL*
innocence
of
any
theft
,
and
would
greatly
facilitate
his
chances
of
*NL*
escape
.
Of
course
,
he
entered
at
this
juncture
,
into
no
explanation
of
*NL*
his
motives
,
and
they
walked
on
very
lovingly
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
pursuance
of
this
cautious
plan
,
Mr.
Claypole
went
on
,
without
*NL*
halting
,
until
he
arrived
at
the
Angel
at
Islington
,
where
he
wisely
*NL*
judged
,
from
the
crowd
of
passengers
and
numbers
of
vehicles
,
that
*NL*
London
began
in
earnest
.
Just
pausing
to
observe
which
appeared
the
*NL*
most
crowded
streets
,
and
consequently
the
most
to
be
avoided
,
he
*NL*
crossed
into
Saint
John
's
Road
,
and
was
soon
deep
in
the
obscurity
of
*NL*
the
intricate
and
dirty
ways
,
which
,
lying
between
Gray
's
Inn
Lane
and
*NL*
Smithfield
,
render
that
part
of
the
town
one
of
the
lowest
and
worst
*NL*
that
improvement
has
left
in
the
midst
of
London
.
*NL*
*NL*
Through
these
streets
,
Noah
Claypole
walked
,
dragging
Charlotte
after
*NL*
him
;
now
stepping
into
the
kennel
to
embrace
at
a
glance
the
whole
*NL*
external
character
of
some
small
public-house
;
now
jogging
on
again
,
as
*NL*
some
fancied
appearance
induced
him
to
believe
it
too
public
for
his
*NL*
purpose
.
At
length
,
he
stopped
in
front
of
one
,
more
humble
in
*NL*
appearance
and
more
dirty
than
any
he
had
yet
seen
;
and
,
having
crossed
*NL*
over
and
surveyed
it
from
the
opposite
pavement
,
graciously
announced
*NL*
his
intention
of
putting
up
there
,
for
the
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
So
give
us
the
bundle
,
'
said
Noah
,
unstrapping
it
from
the
woman
's
*NL*
shoulders
,
and
slinging
it
over
his
own
;
`
and
do
n't
yer
speak
,
except
*NL*
when
yer
spoke
to
.
What
's
the
name
of
the
house
--
t-h-r
--
three
what
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Cripples
,
'
said
Charlotte
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Three
Cripples
,
'
repeated
Noah
,
`
and
a
very
good
sign
too
.
Now
,
then
!
*NL*
Keep
close
at
my
heels
,
and
come
along
.
'
With
these
injunctions
,
he
*NL*
pushed
the
rattling
door
with
his
shoulder
,
and
entered
the
house
,
*NL*
followed
by
his
companion
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
nobody
in
the
bar
but
a
young
Jew
,
who
,
with
his
two
elbows
*NL*
on
the
counter
,
was
reading
a
dirty
newspaper
.
He
stared
very
hard
at
*NL*
Noah
,
and
Noah
stared
very
hard
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
Noah
had
been
attired
in
his
charity-boy
's
dress
,
there
might
have
*NL*
been
some
reason
for
the
Jew
opening
his
eyes
so
wide
;
but
as
he
had
*NL*
discarded
the
coat
and
badge
,
and
wore
a
short
smock-frock
over
his
*NL*
leathers
,
there
seemed
no
particular
reason
for
his
appearance
exciting
*NL*
so
much
attention
in
a
public-house
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Is
this
the
Three
Cripples
?
'
asked
Noah
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
is
the
dabe
of
this
`
ouse
,
'
replied
the
Jew
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
A
gentleman
we
met
on
the
road
,
coming
up
from
the
country
,
*NL*
recommended
us
here
,
'
said
Noah
,
nudging
Charlotte
,
perhaps
to
call
her
*NL*
attention
to
this
most
ingenious
device
for
attracting
respect
,
and
*NL*
perhaps
to
warn
her
to
betray
no
surprise
.
`
We
want
to
sleep
here
*NL*
to-night
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
'
b
dot
certaid
you
cad
,
'
said
Barney
,
who
was
the
attendant
sprite
;
*NL*
`
but
I
'll
idquire
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Show
us
the
tap
,
and
give
us
a
bit
of
cold
meat
and
a
drop
of
beer
*NL*
while
yer
inquiring
,
will
yer
?
'
said
Noah
.
*NL*
*NL*
Barney
complied
by
ushering
them
into
a
small
back-room
,
and
setting
*NL*
the
required
viands
before
them
;
having
done
which
,
he
informed
the
*NL*
travellers
that
they
could
be
lodged
that
night
,
and
left
the
amiable
*NL*
couple
to
their
refreshment
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
this
back-room
was
immediately
behind
the
bar
,
and
some
steps
*NL*
lower
,
so
that
any
person
connected
with
the
house
,
undrawing
a
small
*NL*
curtain
which
concealed
a
single
pane
of
glass
fixed
in
the
wall
of
the
*NL*
last-named
apartment
,
about
five
feet
from
its
flooring
,
could
not
only
*NL*
look
down
upon
any
guests
in
the
back-room
without
any
great
hazard
of
*NL*
being
observed
-LRB-
the
glass
being
in
a
dark
angle
of
the
wall
,
between
*NL*
which
and
a
large
upright
beam
the
observer
had
to
thrust
himself
-RRB-
,
but
*NL*
could
,
by
applying
his
ear
to
the
partition
,
ascertain
with
tolerable
*NL*
distinctness
,
their
subject
of
conversation
.
The
landlord
of
the
house
*NL*
had
not
withdrawn
his
eye
from
this
place
of
espial
for
five
minutes
,
*NL*
and
Barney
had
only
just
returned
from
making
the
communication
above
*NL*
related
,
when
Fagin
,
in
the
course
of
his
evening
's
business
,
came
into
*NL*
the
bar
to
inquire
after
some
of
his
young
pupils
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Hush
!
'
said
Barney
:
`
stradegers
id
the
next
roob
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Strangers
!
'
repeated
the
old
man
in
a
whisper
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ah
!
Ad
rub
uds
too
,
'
added
Barney
.
`
Frob
the
cuttry
,
but
subthig
in
*NL*
your
way
,
or
I
'
b
bistaked
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Fagin
appeared
to
receive
this
communication
with
great
interest
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mounting
a
stool
,
he
cautiously
applied
his
eye
to
the
pane
of
glass
,
*NL*
from
which
secret
post
he
could
see
Mr.
Claypole
taking
cold
beef
from
*NL*
the
dish
,
and
porter
from
the
pot
,
and
administering
homeopathic
doses
*NL*
of
both
to
Charlotte
,
who
sat
patiently
by
,
eating
and
drinking
at
his
*NL*
pleasure
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Aha
!
'
he
whispered
,
looking
round
to
Barney
,
'
I
like
that
fellow
's
*NL*
looks
.
He
'd
be
of
use
to
us
;
he
knows
how
to
train
the
girl
already
.
*NL*
Do
n't
make
as
much
noise
as
a
mouse
,
my
dear
,
and
let
me
hear
'em
*NL*
talk
--
let
me
hear
'em
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
again
applied
his
eye
to
the
glass
,
and
turning
his
ear
to
the
*NL*
partition
,
listened
attentively
:
with
a
subtle
and
eager
look
upon
his
*NL*
face
,
that
might
have
appertained
to
some
old
goblin
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
So
I
mean
to
be
a
gentleman
,
'
said
Mr.
Claypole
,
kicking
out
his
legs
,
*NL*
and
continuing
a
conversation
,
the
commencement
of
which
Fagin
had
*NL*
arrived
too
late
to
hear
.
`
No
more
jolly
old
coffins
,
Charlotte
,
but
a
*NL*
gentleman
's
life
for
me
:
and
,
if
yer
like
,
yer
shall
be
a
lady
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
should
like
that
well
enough
,
dear
,
'
replied
Charlotte
;
`
but
tills
*NL*
ai
n't
to
be
emptied
every
day
,
and
people
to
get
clear
off
after
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'Till
s
be
blowed
!
'
said
Mr.
Claypole
;
`
there
's
more
things
besides
*NL*
tills
to
be
emptied
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
do
you
mean
?
'
asked
his
companion
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Pockets
,
women
's
ridicules
,
houses
,
mail-coaches
,
banks
!
'
said
Mr.
*NL*
Claypole
,
rising
with
the
porter
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
you
ca
n't
do
all
that
,
dear
,
'
said
Charlotte
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
shall
look
out
to
get
into
company
with
them
as
can
,
'
replied
Noah
.
*NL*
`
They
'll
be
able
to
make
us
useful
some
way
or
another
.
Why
,
you
*NL*
yourself
are
worth
fifty
women
;
I
never
see
such
a
precious
sly
and
*NL*
deceitful
creetur
as
yer
can
be
when
I
let
yer
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Lor
,
how
nice
it
is
to
hear
yer
say
so
!
'
exclaimed
Charlotte
,
*NL*
imprinting
a
kiss
upon
his
ugly
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
There
,
that
'll
do
:
do
n't
yer
be
too
affectionate
,
in
case
I
'm
cross
*NL*
with
yer
,
'
said
Noah
,
disengaging
himself
with
great
gravity
.
'
I
*NL*
should
like
to
be
the
captain
of
some
band
,
and
have
the
whopping
of
*NL*
'em
,
and
follering
'em
about
,
unbeknown
to
themselves
.
That
would
suit
*NL*
me
,
if
there
was
good
profit
;
and
if
we
could
only
get
in
with
some
*NL*
gentleman
of
this
sort
,
I
say
it
would
be
cheap
at
that
twenty-pound
*NL*
note
you
've
got
,
--
especially
as
we
do
n't
very
well
know
how
to
get
rid
*NL*
of
it
ourselves
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
After
expressing
this
opinion
,
Mr.
Claypole
looked
into
the
porter-pot
*NL*
with
an
aspect
of
deep
wisdom
;
and
having
well
shaken
its
contents
,
*NL*
nodded
condescendingly
to
Charlotte
,
and
took
a
draught
,
wherewith
he
*NL*
appeared
greatly
refreshed
.
He
was
meditating
another
,
when
the
sudden
*NL*
opening
of
the
door
,
and
the
appearance
of
a
stranger
,
interrupted
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
stranger
was
Mr.
Fagin
.
And
very
amiable
he
looked
,
and
a
very
low
*NL*
bow
he
made
,
as
he
advanced
,
and
setting
himself
down
at
the
nearest
*NL*
table
,
ordered
something
to
drink
of
the
grinning
Barney
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
A
pleasant
night
,
sir
,
but
cool
for
the
time
of
year
,
'
said
Fagin
,
*NL*
rubbing
his
hands
.
`
From
the
country
,
I
see
,
sir
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
How
do
yer
see
that
?

asked
Noah
Claypole
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
We
have
not
so
much
dust
as
that
in
London
,
'
replied
Fagin
,
pointing
*NL*
from
Noah
's
shoes
to
those
of
his
companion
,
and
from
them
to
the
two
*NL*
bundles
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yer
a
sharp
feller
,
'
said
Noah
.
`
Ha
!
ha
!
only
hear
that
,
Charlotte
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
one
need
be
sharp
in
this
town
,
my
dear
,
'
replied
the
Jew
,
*NL*
sinking
his
voice
to
a
confidential
whisper
;
`
and
that
's
the
truth
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Fagin
followed
up
this
remark
by
striking
the
side
of
his
nose
with
his
*NL*
right
forefinger
,
--
a
gesture
which
Noah
attempted
to
imitate
,
though
*NL*
not
with
complete
success
,
in
consequence
of
his
own
nose
not
being
*NL*
large
enough
for
the
purpose
.
However
,
Mr.
Fagin
seemed
to
interpret
*NL*
the
endeavour
as
expressing
a
perfect
coincidence
with
his
opinion
,
and
*NL*
put
about
the
liquor
which
Barney
reappeared
with
,
in
a
very
friendly
*NL*
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Good
stuff
that
,
'
observed
Mr.
Claypole
,
smacking
his
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Dear
!
'
said
Fagin
.
'
A
man
need
be
always
emptying
a
till
,
or
a
*NL*
pocket
,
or
a
woman
's
reticule
,
or
a
house
,
or
a
mail-coach
,
or
a
bank
,
*NL*
if
he
drinks
it
regularly
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Claypole
no
sooner
heard
this
extract
from
his
own
remarks
than
he
*NL*
fell
back
in
his
chair
,
and
looked
from
the
Jew
to
Charlotte
with
a
*NL*
countenance
of
ashy
paleness
and
excessive
terror
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Do
n't
mind
me
,
my
dear
,
'
said
Fagin
,
drawing
his
chair
closer
.
`
Ha
!
*NL*
ha
!
it
was
lucky
it
was
only
me
that
heard
you
by
chance
.
It
was
very
*NL*
lucky
it
was
only
me
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
did
n't
take
it
,
'
stammered
Noah
,
no
longer
stretching
out
his
legs
*NL*
like
an
independent
gentleman
,
but
coiling
them
up
as
well
as
he
could
*NL*
under
his
chair
;
`
it
was
all
her
doing
;
yer
've
got
it
now
,
Charlotte
,
*NL*
yer
know
yer
have
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
matter
who
's
got
it
,
or
who
did
it
,
my
dear
,
'
replied
Fagin
,
*NL*
glancing
,
nevertheless
,
with
a
hawk
's
eye
at
the
girl
and
the
two
*NL*
bundles
.
`
I
'm
in
that
way
myself
,
and
I
like
you
for
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
In
what
way
?
'
asked
Mr.
Claypole
,
a
little
recovering
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
In
that
way
of
business
,
'
rejoined
Fagin
;
`
and
so
are
the
people
of
*NL*
the
house
.
You
've
hit
the
right
nail
upon
the
head
,
and
are
as
safe
*NL*
here
as
you
could
be
.
There
is
not
a
safer
place
in
all
this
town
than
*NL*
is
the
Cripples
;
that
is
,
when
I
like
to
make
it
so
.
And
I
have
taken
*NL*
a
fancy
to
you
and
the
young
woman
;
so
I
've
said
the
word
,
and
you
may
*NL*
make
your
minds
easy
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Noah
Claypole
's
mind
might
have
been
at
ease
after
this
assurance
,
but
*NL*
his
body
certainly
was
not
;
for
he
shuffled
and
writhed
about
,
into
*NL*
various
uncouth
positions
:
eyeing
his
new
friend
meanwhile
with
*NL*
mingled
fear
and
suspicion
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
'll
tell
you
more
,
'
said
Fagin
,
after
he
had
reassured
the
girl
,
by
*NL*
dint
of
friendly
nods
and
muttered
encouragements
.
'
I
have
got
a
friend
*NL*
that
I
think
can
gratify
your
darling
wish
,
and
put
you
in
the
right
*NL*
way
,
where
you
can
take
whatever
department
of
the
business
you
think
*NL*
will
suit
you
best
at
first
,
and
be
taught
all
the
others
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yer
speak
as
if
yer
were
in
earnest
,
'
replied
Noah
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
advantage
would
it
be
to
me
to
be
anything
else
?
'
inquired
Fagin
,
*NL*
shrugging
his
shoulders
.
`
Here
!
Let
me
have
a
word
with
you
outside
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
There
's
no
occasion
to
trouble
ourselves
to
move
,
'
said
Noah
,
getting
*NL*
his
legs
by
gradual
degrees
abroad
again
.
`
She
'll
take
the
luggage
*NL*
upstairs
the
while
.
Charlotte
,
see
to
them
bundles
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
This
mandate
,
which
had
been
delivered
with
great
majesty
,
was
obeyed
*NL*
without
the
slightest
demur
;
and
Charlotte
made
the
best
of
her
way
off
*NL*
with
the
packages
while
Noah
held
the
door
open
and
watched
her
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
She
's
kept
tolerably
well
under
,
ai
n't
she
?
'
he
asked
as
he
resumed
*NL*
his
seat
:
in
the
tone
of
a
keeper
who
had
tamed
some
wild
animal
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Quite
perfect
,
'
rejoined
Fagin
,
clapping
him
on
the
shoulder
.
`
You
're
*NL*
a
genius
,
my
dear
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
I
suppose
if
I
was
n't
,
I
should
n't
be
here
,
'
replied
Noah
.
`
But
,
*NL*
I
say
,
she
'll
be
back
if
yer
lose
time
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Now
,
what
do
you
think
?
'
said
Fagin
.
`
If
you
was
to
like
my
friend
,
*NL*
could
you
do
better
than
join
him
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Is
he
in
a
good
way
of
business
;
that
's
where
it
is
!
'
responded
Noah
,
*NL*
winking
one
of
his
little
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
top
of
the
tree
;
employs
a
power
of
hands
;
has
the
very
best
*NL*
society
in
the
profession
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Regular
town-maders
?
'
asked
Mr.
Claypole
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Not
a
countryman
among
'em
;
and
I
do
n't
think
he
'd
take
you
,
even
on
*NL*
my
recommendation
,
if
he
did
n't
run
rather
short
of
assistants
just
*NL*
now
,
'
replied
Fagin
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Should
I
have
to
hand
over
?
'
said
Noah
,
slapping
his
breeches-pocket
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
could
n't
possibly
be
done
without
,
'
replied
Fagin
,
in
a
most
*NL*
decided
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Twenty
pound
,
though
--
it
's
a
lot
of
money
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Not
when
it
's
in
a
note
you
ca
n't
get
rid
of
,
'
retorted
Fagin
.
`
Number
*NL*
and
date
taken
,
I
suppose
?
Payment
stopped
at
the
Bank
?
Ah
!
It
's
not
*NL*
worth
much
to
him
.
It
'll
have
to
go
abroad
,
and
he
could
n't
sell
it
*NL*
for
a
great
deal
in
the
market
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
When
could
I
see
him
?
'
asked
Noah
doubtfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
To-morrow
morning
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Where
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Here
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Um
!
'
said
Noah
.
`
What
's
the
wages
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Live
like
a
gentleman
--
board
and
lodging
,
pipes
and
spirits
free
--
half
*NL*
of
all
you
earn
,
and
half
of
all
the
young
woman
earns
,
'
replied
Mr.
*NL*
Fagin
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whether
Noah
Claypole
,
whose
rapacity
was
none
of
the
least
*NL*
comprehensive
,
would
have
acceded
even
to
these
glowing
terms
,
had
he
*NL*
been
a
perfectly
free
agent
,
is
very
doubtful
;
but
as
he
recollected
*NL*
that
,
in
the
event
of
his
refusal
,
it
was
in
the
power
of
his
new
*NL*
acquaintance
to
give
him
up
to
justice
immediately
-LRB-
and
more
unlikely
*NL*
things
had
come
to
pass
-RRB-
,
he
gradually
relented
,
and
said
he
thought
*NL*
that
would
suit
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
,
yer
see
,
'
observed
Noah
,
`
as
she
will
be
able
to
do
a
good
deal
,
*NL*
I
should
like
to
take
something
very
light
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
A
little
fancy
work
?
'
suggested
Fagin
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ah
!
something
of
that
sort
,
'
replied
Noah
.
`
What
do
you
think
would
*NL*
suit
me
now
?
Something
not
too
trying
for
the
strength
,
and
not
very
*NL*
dangerous
,
you
know
.
That
's
the
sort
of
thing
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
heard
you
talk
of
something
in
the
spy
way
upon
the
others
,
my
*NL*
dear
,
'
said
Fagin
.
`
My
friend
wants
somebody
who
would
do
that
well
,
*NL*
very
much
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
I
did
mention
that
,
and
I
should
n't
mind
turning
my
hand
to
it
*NL*
sometimes
,
'
rejoined
Mr.
Claypole
slowly
;
`
but
it
would
n't
pay
by
*NL*
itself
,
you
know
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
's
true
!
'
observed
the
Jew
,
ruminating
or
pretending
to
ruminate
.
*NL*
`
No
,
it
might
not
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
do
you
think
,
then
?
'
asked
Noah
,
anxiously
regarding
him
.
*NL*
`
Something
in
the
sneaking
way
,
where
it
was
pretty
sure
work
,
and
not
*NL*
much
more
risk
than
being
at
home
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
do
you
think
of
the
old
ladies
?
'
asked
Fagin
.
`
There
's
a
good
*NL*
deal
of
money
made
in
snatching
their
bags
and
parcels
,
and
running
*NL*
round
the
corner
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Do
n't
they
holler
out
a
good
deal
,
and
scratch
sometimes
?
'
asked
Noah
,
*NL*
shaking
his
head
.
'
I
do
n't
think
that
would
answer
my
purpose
.
Ai
n't
*NL*
there
any
other
line
open
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Stop
!
'
said
Fagin
,
laying
his
hand
on
Noah
's
knee
.
`
The
kinchin
lay
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
's
that
?
'
demanded
Mr.
Claypole
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
kinchins
,
my
dear
,
'
said
Fagin
,
`
is
the
young
children
that
's
sent
*NL*
on
errands
by
their
mothers
,
with
sixpences
and
shillings
;
and
the
lay
*NL*
is
just
to
take
their
money
away
--
they
've
always
got
it
ready
in
their
*NL*
hands
,
--
then
knock
'em
into
the
kennel
,
and
walk
off
very
slow
,
as
if
*NL*
there
were
nothing
else
the
matter
but
a
child
fallen
down
and
hurt
*NL*
itself
.
Ha
!
ha
!
ha
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ha
!
ha
!
'
roared
Mr.
Claypole
,
kicking
up
his
legs
in
an
ecstasy
.
*NL*
`
Lord
,
that
's
the
very
thing
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
To
be
sure
it
is
,
'
replied
Fagin
;
`
and
you
can
have
a
few
good
beats
*NL*
chalked
out
in
Camden
Town
,
and
Battle
Bridge
,
and
neighborhoods
like
*NL*
that
,
where
they
're
always
going
errands
;
and
you
can
upset
as
many
*NL*
kinchins
as
you
want
,
any
hour
in
the
day
.
Ha
!
ha
!
ha
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
With
this
,
Fagin
poked
Mr.
Claypole
in
the
side
,
and
they
joined
in
a
*NL*
burst
of
laughter
both
long
and
loud
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
that
's
all
right
!
'
said
Noah
,
when
he
had
recovered
himself
,
and
*NL*
Charlotte
had
returned
.
`
What
time
to-morrow
shall
we
say
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Will
ten
do
?
'
asked
Fagin
,
adding
,
as
Mr.
Claypole
nodded
assent
,
*NL*
`
What
name
shall
I
tell
my
good
friend
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Mr.
Bolter
,
'
replied
Noah
,
who
had
prepared
himself
for
such
*NL*
emergency
.
`
Mr.
Morris
Bolter
.
This
is
Mrs.
Bolter
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Mrs.
Bolter
's
humble
servant
,
'
said
Fagin
,
bowing
with
grotesque
*NL*
politeness
.
'
I
hope
I
shall
know
her
better
very
shortly
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Do
you
hear
the
gentleman
,
Charlotte
?
'
thundered
Mr.
Claypole
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
Noah
,
dear
!
'
replied
Mrs.
Bolter
,
extending
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
She
calls
me
Noah
,
as
a
sort
of
fond
way
of
talking
,
'
said
Mr.
Morris
*NL*
Bolter
,
late
Claypole
,
turning
to
Fagin
.
`
You
understand
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
yes
,
I
understand
--
perfectly
,
'
replied
Fagin
,
telling
the
truth
for
*NL*
once
.
`
Good-night
!
Good-night
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
With
many
adieus
and
good
wishes
,
Mr.
Fagin
went
his
way
.
Noah
*NL*
Claypole
,
bespeaking
his
good
lady
's
attention
,
proceeded
to
enlighten
*NL*
her
relative
to
the
arrangement
he
had
made
,
with
all
that
haughtiness
*NL*
and
air
of
superiority
,
becoming
,
not
only
a
member
of
the
sterner
sex
,
*NL*
but
a
gentleman
who
appreciated
the
dignity
of
a
special
appointment
on
*NL*
the
kinchin
lay
,
in
London
and
its
vicinity

*NL*
*NL*
WHEREIN
IS
SHOWN
HOW
THE
ARTFUL
DODGER
GOT
INTO
TROUBLE
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
so
it
was
you
that
was
your
own
friend
,
was
it
?
'
asked
Mr.
*NL*
Claypole
,
otherwise
Bolter
,
when
,
by
virtue
of
the
compact
entered
into
*NL*
between
them
,
he
had
removed
next
day
to
Fagin
's
house
.
''
Cod
,
I
*NL*
thought
as
much
last
night
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Every
man
's
his
own
friend
,
my
dear
,
'
replied
Fagin
,
with
his
most
*NL*
insinuating
grin
.
`
He
has
n't
as
good
a
one
as
himself
anywhere
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Except
sometimes
,
'
replied
Morris
Bolter
,
assuming
the
air
of
a
man
of
*NL*
the
world
.
`
Some
people
are
nobody
's
enemies
but
their
own
,
yer
know
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Do
n't
believe
that
,
'
said
Fagin
.
`
When
a
man
's
his
own
enemy
,
it
's
*NL*
only
because
he
's
too
much
his
own
friend
;
not
because
he
's
careful
for
*NL*
everybody
but
himself
.
Pooh
!
pooh
!
There
ai
n't
such
a
thing
in
*NL*
nature
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
There
ough
n't
to
be
,
if
there
is
,
'
replied
Mr.
Bolter
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
stands
to
reason
.
Some
conjurers
say
that
number
three
is
the
*NL*
magic
number
,
and
some
say
number
seven
.
It
's
neither
,
my
friend
,
*NL*
neither
.
It
's
number
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ha
!
ha
!
'
cried
Mr.
Bolter
.
`
Number
one
for
ever
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
In
a
little
community
like
ours
,
my
dear
,
'
said
Fagin
,
who
felt
it
*NL*
necessary
to
qualify
this
position
,
`
we
have
a
general
number
one
,
*NL*
without
considering
me
too
as
the
same
,
and
all
the
other
young
people
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
,
the
devil
!
'
exclaimed
Mr.
Bolter
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
see
,
'
pursued
Fagin
,
affecting
to
disregard
this
interruption
,
`
we
*NL*
are
so
mixed
up
together
,
and
identified
in
our
interests
,
that
it
must
*NL*
be
so
.
For
instance
,
it
's
your
object
to
take
care
of
number
*NL*
one
--
meaning
yourself
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Certainly
,
'
replied
Mr.
Bolter
.
`
Yer
about
right
there
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
!
You
ca
n't
take
care
of
yourself
,
number
one
,
without
taking
*NL*
care
of
me
,
number
one
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Number
two
,
you
mean
,
'
said
Mr.
Bolter
,
who
was
largely
endowed
with
*NL*
the
quality
of
selfishness
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
I
do
n't
!
'
retorted
Fagin
.
`
I
'm
of
the
same
importance
to
you
,
as
*NL*
you
are
to
yourself
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
say
,
'
interrupted
Mr.
Bolter
,
`
yer
a
very
nice
man
,
and
I
'm
very
*NL*
fond
of
yer
;
but
we
ai
n't
quite
so
thick
together
,
as
all
that
comes
*NL*
to
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Only
think
,
'
said
Fagin
,
shrugging
his
shoulders
,
and
stretching
out
*NL*
his
hands
;
`
only
consider
.
You
've
done
what
's
a
very
pretty
thing
,
and
*NL*
what
I
love
you
for
doing
;
but
what
at
the
same
time
would
put
the
*NL*
cravat
round
your
throat
,
that
's
so
very
easily
tied
and
so
very
*NL*
difficult
to
unloose
--
in
plain
English
,
the
halter
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bolter
put
his
hand
to
his
neckerchief
,
as
if
he
felt
it
*NL*
inconveniently
tight
;
and
murmured
an
assent
,
qualified
in
tone
but
not
*NL*
in
substance
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
gallows
,
'
continued
Fagin
,
`
the
gallows
,
my
dear
,
is
an
ugly
*NL*
finger-post
,
which
points
out
a
very
short
and
sharp
turning
that
has
*NL*
stopped
many
a
bold
fellow
's
career
on
the
broad
highway
.
To
keep
in
*NL*
the
easy
road
,
and
keep
it
at
a
distance
,
is
object
number
one
with
*NL*
you
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Of
course
it
is
,
'
replied
Mr.
Bolter
.
`
What
do
yer
talk
about
such
*NL*
things
for
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Only
to
show
you
my
meaning
clearly
,
'
said
the
Jew
,
raising
his
*NL*
eyebrows
.
`
To
be
able
to
do
that
,
you
depend
upon
me
.
To
keep
my
*NL*
little
business
all
snug
,
I
depend
upon
you
.
The
first
is
your
number
*NL*
one
,
the
second
my
number
one
.
The
more
you
value
your
number
one
,
the
*NL*
more
careful
you
must
be
of
mine
;
so
we
come
at
last
to
what
I
told
you
*NL*
at
first
--
that
a
regard
for
number
one
holds
us
all
together
,
and
must
*NL*
do
so
,
unless
we
would
all
go
to
pieces
in
company
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
's
true
,
'
rejoined
Mr.
Bolter
,
thoughtfully
.
`
Oh
!
yer
a
cunning
*NL*
old
codger
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Fagin
saw
,
with
delight
,
that
this
tribute
to
his
powers
was
no
*NL*
mere
compliment
,
but
that
he
had
really
impressed
his
recruit
with
a
*NL*
sense
of
his
wily
genius
,
which
it
was
most
important
that
he
should
*NL*
entertain
in
the
outset
of
their
acquaintance
.
To
strengthen
an
*NL*
impression
so
desirable
and
useful
,
he
followed
up
the
blow
by
*NL*
acquainting
him
,
in
some
detail
,
with
the
magnitude
and
extent
of
his
*NL*
operations
;
blending
truth
and
fiction
together
,
as
best
served
his
*NL*
purpose
;
and
bringing
both
to
bear
,
with
so
much
art
,
that
Mr.
Bolter
's
*NL*
respect
visibly
increased
,
and
became
tempered
,
at
the
same
time
,
with
*NL*
a
degree
of
wholesome
fear
,
which
it
was
highly
desirable
to
awaken
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
's
this
mutual
trust
we
have
in
each
other
that
consoles
me
under
*NL*
heavy
losses
,
'
said
Fagin
.
`
My
best
hand
was
taken
from
me
,
yesterday
*NL*
morning
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
do
n't
mean
to
say
he
died
?
'
cried
Mr.
Bolter
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
no
,
'
replied
Fagin
,
`
not
so
bad
as
that
.
Not
quite
so
bad
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
,
I
suppose
he
was
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Wanted
,
'
interposed
Fagin
.
`
Yes
,
he
was
wanted
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Very
particular
?
'
inquired
Mr.
Bolter
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
'
replied
Fagin
,
`
not
very
.
He
was
charged
with
attempting
to
pick
*NL*
a
pocket
,
and
they
found
a
silver
snuff-box
on
him
,
--
his
own
,
my
dear
,
*NL*
his
own
,
for
he
took
snuff
himself
,
and
was
very
fond
of
it
.
They
*NL*
remanded
him
till
to-day
,
for
they
thought
they
knew
the
owner
.
Ah
!
he
*NL*
was
worth
fifty
boxes
,
and
I
'd
give
the
price
of
as
many
to
have
him
*NL*
back
.
You
should
have
known
the
Dodger
,
my
dear
;
you
should
have
known
*NL*
the
Dodger
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
but
I
shall
know
him
,
I
hope
;
do
n't
yer
think
so
?
'
said
Mr.
*NL*
Bolter
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
'm
doubtful
about
it
,
'
replied
Fagin
,
with
a
sigh
.
`
If
they
do
n't
*NL*
get
any
fresh
evidence
,
it
'll
only
be
a
summary
conviction
,
and
we
*NL*
shall
have
him
back
again
after
six
weeks
or
so
;
but
,
if
they
do
,
it
's
*NL*
a
case
of
lagging
.
They
know
what
a
clever
lad
he
is
;
he
'll
be
a
*NL*
lifer
.
They
'll
make
the
Artful
nothing
less
than
a
lifer
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
do
you
mean
by
lagging
and
a
lifer
?
'
demanded
Mr.
Bolter
.
`
What
's
*NL*
the
good
of
talking
in
that
way
to
me
;
why
do
n't
yer
speak
so
as
I
can
*NL*
understand
yer
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
Fagin
was
about
to
translate
these
mysterious
expressions
into
the
*NL*
vulgar
tongue
;
and
,
being
interpreted
,
Mr.
Bolter
would
have
been
*NL*
informed
that
they
represented
that
combination
of
words
,
*NL*
`
transportation
for
life
,
'
when
the
dialogue
was
cut
short
by
the
entry
*NL*
of
Master
Bates
,
with
his
hands
in
his
breeches-pockets
,
and
his
face
*NL*
twisted
into
a
look
of
semi-comical
woe
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
's
all
up
,
Fagin
,
'
said
Charley
,
when
he
and
his
new
companion
had
*NL*
been
made
known
to
each
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
do
you
mean
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
They
've
found
the
gentleman
as
owns
the
box
;
two
or
three
more
's
a
*NL*
coming
to
`
dentify
him
;
and
the
Artful
's
booked
for
a
passage
out
,
'
*NL*
replied
Master
Bates
.
'
I
must
have
a
full
suit
of
mourning
,
Fagin
,
and
*NL*
a
hatband
,
to
wisit
him
in
,
afore
he
sets
out
upon
his
travels
.
To
*NL*
think
of
Jack
Dawkins
--
lummy
Jack
--
the
Dodger
--
the
Artful
Dodger
--
going
*NL*
abroad
for
a
common
twopenny-halfpenny
sneeze-box
!
I
never
thought
*NL*
he
'd
a
done
it
under
a
gold
watch
,
chain
,
and
seals
,
at
the
lowest
.
*NL*
Oh
,
why
did
n't
he
rob
some
rich
old
gentleman
of
all
his
walables
,
and
*NL*
go
out
as
a
gentleman
,
and
not
like
a
common
prig
,
without
no
honour
*NL*
nor
glory
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
With
this
expression
of
feeling
for
his
unfortunate
friend
,
Master
*NL*
Bates
sat
himself
on
the
nearest
chair
with
an
aspect
of
chagrin
and
*NL*
despondency
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
do
you
talk
about
his
having
neither
honour
nor
glory
for
!
'
*NL*
exclaimed
Fagin
,
darting
an
angry
look
at
his
pupil
.
`
Was
n't
he
always
*NL*
the
top-sawyer
among
you
all
!
Is
there
one
of
you
that
could
touch
him
*NL*
or
come
near
him
on
any
scent
!
Eh
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Not
one
,
'
replied
Master
Bates
,
in
a
voice
rendered
husky
by
regret
;
*NL*
`
not
one
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Then
what
do
you
talk
of
?
'
replied
Fagin
angrily
;
`
what
are
you
*NL*
blubbering
for
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
''
Cause
it
is
n't
on
the
rec-ord
,
is
it
?
'
said
Charley
,
chafed
into
*NL*
perfect
defiance
of
his
venerable
friend
by
the
current
of
his
regrets
;
*NL*
''
cause
it
ca
n't
come
out
in
the
`
dictment
;
'cause
nobody
will
never
*NL*
know
half
of
what
he
was
.
How
will
he
stand
in
the
Newgate
Calendar
?
*NL*
P'raps
not
be
there
at
all
.
Oh
,
my
eye
,
my
eye
,
wot
a
blow
it
is
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ha
!
ha
!
'
cried
Fagin
,
extending
his
right
hand
,
and
turning
to
Mr.
*NL*
Bolter
in
a
fit
of
chuckling
which
shook
him
as
though
he
had
the
*NL*
palsy
;
`
see
what
a
pride
they
take
in
their
profession
,
my
dear
.
Ai
n't
*NL*
it
beautiful
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bolter
nodded
assent
,
and
Fagin
,
after
contemplating
the
grief
of
*NL*
Charley
Bates
for
some
seconds
with
evident
satisfaction
,
stepped
up
to
*NL*
that
young
gentleman
and
patted
him
on
the
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Never
mind
,
Charley
,
'
said
Fagin
soothingly
;
`
it
'll
come
out
,
it
'll
be
*NL*
sure
to
come
out
.
They
'll
all
know
what
a
clever
fellow
he
was
;
he
'll
*NL*
show
it
himself
,
and
not
disgrace
his
old
pals
and
teachers
.
Think
how
*NL*
young
he
is
too
!
What
a
distinction
,
Charley
,
to
be
lagged
at
his
time
*NL*
of
life
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
it
is
a
honour
that
is
!
'
said
Charley
,
a
little
consoled
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
shall
have
all
he
wants
,
'
continued
the
Jew
.
`
He
shall
be
kept
in
*NL*
the
Stone
Jug
,
Charley
,
like
a
gentleman

Like
a
gentleman
!
With
his
*NL*
beer
every
day
,

money
in
his
pocket
to
pitch
and
toss
with
,
if
he
*NL*
ca
n't
spend
it
.

*NL*
*NL*
`
No

shall
he
though
?
'
cried
Charley
Bates
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ay
,
that
he
shall

'
replied
Fagin
,
`
and
we
'll
have
a
big-wig
,
Charley
:
*NL*
one
that
's
got
the
greatest
gift
of
the
gab
:
to
carry
on
his
defence
;

he
shall
make
a
speech
for
himself
too

he
likes

'll
read

it
all
in

papers

``
Artful
Dodger

shrieks
of
laughter

here
the

court

convulsed

Charley

*NL*
*NL*
`

laughed
Master
Bates
,
`
what
a
lark
that
would
be
,
would

*NL*
it
,
Fagin
?
I
say
,
how

Artful
would
bother

*NL*
*NL*
`
Would

Fagin

*NL*

`
Ah

to
be

he
will

repeated
Charley
,
rubbing
his
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*

I
think
I
see
him
now

cried
the
Jew
,
bending
his
eyes
upon
his
pupil
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
So
do
I
,

cried
Charley
Bates
.
`
Ha

so
do
I.

see
it
all

afore

do

Fagin

What
a
game
!
What
a
regular
game

*NL*
All
the
big-wigs
trying
to
look
solemn
,

Jack
Dawkins
addressing
of

as
intimate

comfortable
as

a

dinner

'
*NL*
*NL*
In
fact
,
Mr.
Fagin
had
so
well
humoured
his
young
friend
's
eccentric
*NL*
disposition
,
that
Master
Bates
,
who
had
at
first
been
disposed
to
*NL*
consider
the
imprisoned
Dodger
rather
in
the
light
of
a
victim
,
now
*NL*
looked
upon
him
as
the
chief
actor
in
a
scene
of
most
uncommon
and
*NL*
exquisite
humour
,
and
felt
quite
impatient
for
the
arrival
of
the
time
*NL*
when
his
old
companion
should
have
so
favourable
an
opportunity
of
*NL*
displaying
his
abilities
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
We
must
know
how
he
gets
on
to-day

some
handy
means

said
Fagin
.
`
Let
me
think

'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Shall
I
go
?
'
asked
Charley
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Not
for
the
world
,
'
replied
Fagin
.
`
Are
you
mad
,
my
dear
,
stark
mad

*NL*
that
you
'd
walk
into

One
is
*NL*
enough
to
lose
at
a
time
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
do
n't
mean
to
go
yourself
,
I
suppose
?
'
said
Charley
with
a
*NL*
humorous
leer
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
would
n't
quite
fit
,
'
replied
Fagin
shaking
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Then
why
do
n't
you
send
this
new
cove
?
'
asked
Master
Bates
,
laying
his
*NL*
hand
on
Noah
's
arm
.
`
Nobody
knows
him
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
if
he
did
n't
mind
--
'
observed
Fagin
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Mind
!
'
interposed
Charley
.
`
What
should
he
have
to
mind
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Really
nothing
,
my
dear
,
'
said
Fagin
,
turning
to
Mr.
Bolter
,
`
really
*NL*
nothing
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
,
I
dare
say
about
that
,
yer
know
,
'
observed
Noah
,
backing
towards
*NL*
the
door
,
and
shaking
his
head
with
a
kind
of
sober
alarm
.
`
No
,
*NL*
no
--
none
of
that
.
It
's
not
in
my
department
,
that
ai
n't
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Wot
department
has
he
got
,
Fagin
?
'
inquired
Master
Bates
,
surveying
*NL*
Noah
's
lank
form
with
much
disgust
.
`
The
cutting
away
when
there
's
*NL*
anything
wrong
,
and
the
eating
all
the
wittles
when
there
's
everything
*NL*
right
;
is
that
his
branch
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Never
mind
,
'
retorted
Mr.
Bolter
;
`
and
do
n't
yer
take
liberties
with
*NL*
yer
superiors
,
little
boy
,
or
yer
'll
find
yerself
in
the
wrong
shop
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Master
Bates
laughed
so
vehemently
at
this
magnificent
threat
,
that
it
*NL*
was
some
time
before
Fagin
could
interpose
,
and
represent
to
Mr.
Bolter
*NL*
that
he
incurred
no
possible
danger
in
visiting
the
police-office
;
*NL*
that
,
inasmuch
as
no
account
of
the
little
affair
in
which
he
had
*NL*
engaged
,
nor
any
description
of
his
person
,
had
yet
been
forwarded
to
*NL*
the
metropolis
,
it
was
very
probable
that
he
was
not
even
suspected
of
*NL*
having
resorted
to
it
for
shelter
;
and
that
,
if
he
were
properly
*NL*
disguised
,
it
would
be
as
safe
a
spot
for
him
to
visit
as
any
in
*NL*
London
,
inasmuch
as
it
would
be
,
of
all
places
,
the
very
last
,
to
which
*NL*
he
could
be
supposed
likely
to
resort
of
his
own
free
will
.
*NL*
*NL*
Persuaded
,
in
part
,
by
these
representations
,
but
overborne
in
a
much
*NL*
greater
degree
by
his
fear
of
Fagin
,
Mr.
Bolter
at
length
consented
,
*NL*
with
a
very
bad
grace
,
to
undertake
the
expedition
.
By
Fagin
's
*NL*
directions
,
he
immediately
substituted
for
his
own
attire
,
a
waggoner
's
*NL*
frock
,
velveteen
breeches
,
and
leather
leggings
:
all
of
which
articles
*NL*
the
Jew
had
at
hand
.
He
was
likewise
furnished
with
a
felt
hat
well
*NL*
garnished
with
turnpike
tickets
;
and
a
carter
's
whip
.
Thus
equipped
,
*NL*
he
was
to
saunter
into
the
office
,
as
some
country
fellow
from
Covent
*NL*
Garden
market
might
be
supposed
to
do
for
the
gratification
of
his
*NL*
curiousity
;
and
as
he
was
as
awkward
,
ungainly
,
and
raw-boned
a
fellow
*NL*
as
need
be
,
Mr.
Fagin
had
no
fear
but
that
he
would
look
the
part
to
*NL*
perfection
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
arrangements
completed
,
he
was
informed
of
the
necessary
signs
*NL*
and
tokens
by
which
to
recognise
the
Artful
Dodger
,
and
was
conveyed
by
*NL*
Master
Bates
through
dark
and
winding
ways
to
within
a
very
short
*NL*
distance
of
Bow
Street
.
Having
described
the
precise
situation
of
the
*NL*
office
,
and
accompanied
it
with
copious
directions
how
he
was
to
walk
*NL*
straight
up
the
passage
,
and
when
he
got
into
the
side
,
and
pull
off
*NL*
his
hat
as
he
went
into
the
room
,
Charley
Bates
bade
him
hurry
on
*NL*
alone
,
and
promised
to
bide
his
return
on
the
spot
of
their
parting
.
*NL*
*NL*
Noah
Claypole
,
or
Morris
Bolter
as
the
reader
pleases
,
punctually
*NL*
followed
the
directions
he
had
received
,
which
--
Master
Bates
being
*NL*
pretty
well
acquainted
with
the
locality
--
were
so
exact
that
he
was
*NL*
enabled
to
gain
the
magisterial
presence
without
asking
any
question
,
*NL*
or
meeting
with
any
interruption
by
the
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
found
himself
jostled
among
a
crowd
of
people
,
chiefly
women
,
who
*NL*
were
huddled
together
in
a
dirty
frowsy
room
,
at
the
upper
end
of
which
*NL*
was
a
raised
platform
railed
off
from
the
rest
,
with
a
dock
for
the
*NL*
prisoners
on
the
left
hand
against
the
wall
,
a
box
for
the
witnesses
in
*NL*
the
middle
,
and
a
desk
for
the
magistrates
on
the
right
;
the
awful
*NL*
locality
last
named
,
being
screened
off
by
a
partition
which
concealed
*NL*
the
bench
from
the
common
gaze
,
and
left
the
vulgar
to
imagine
-LRB-
if
they
*NL*
could
-RRB-
the
full
majesty
of
justice
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
only
a
couple
of
women
in
the
dock
,
who
were
nodding
to
*NL*
their
admiring
friends
,
while
the
clerk
read
some
depositions
to
a
*NL*
couple
of
policemen
and
a
man
in
plain
clothes
who
leant
over
the
*NL*
table
.
A
jailer
stood
reclining
against
the
dock-rail
,
tapping
his
*NL*
nose
listlessly
with
a
large
key
,
except
when
he
repressed
an
undue
*NL*
tendency
to
conversation
among
the
idlers
,
by
proclaiming
silence
;
or
*NL*
looked
sternly
up
to
bid
some
woman
`
Take
that
baby
out
,
'
when
the
*NL*
gravity
of
justice
was
disturbed
by
feeble
cries
,
half-smothered
in
the
*NL*
mother
's
shawl
,
from
some
meagre
infant
.
The
room
smelt
close
and
*NL*
unwholesome
;
the
walls
were
dirt-discoloured
;
and
the
ceiling
*NL*
blackened
.
There
was
an
old
smoky
bust
over
the
mantel-shelf
,
and
a
*NL*
dusty
clock
above
the
dock
--
the
only
thing
present
,
that
seemed
to
go
*NL*
on
as
it
ought
;
for
depravity
,
or
poverty
,
or
an
habitual
acquaintance
*NL*
with
both
,
had
left
a
taint
on
all
the
animate
matter
,
hardly
less
*NL*
unpleasant
than
the
thick
greasy
scum
on
every
inanimate
object
that
*NL*
frowned
upon
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Noah
looked
eagerly
about
him
for
the
Dodger
;
but
although
there
were
*NL*
several
women
who
would
have
done
very
well
for
that
distinguished
*NL*
character
's
mother
or
sister
,
and
more
than
one
man
who
might
be
*NL*
supposed
to
bear
a
strong
resemblance
to
his
father
,
nobody
at
all
*NL*
answering
the
description
given
him
of
Mr.
Dawkins
was
to
be
seen
.
He
*NL*
waited
in
a
state
of
much
suspense
and
uncertainty
until
the
women
,
*NL*
being
committed
for
trial
,
went
flaunting
out
;
and
then
was
quickly
*NL*
relieved
by
the
appearance
of
another
prisoner
who
he
felt
at
once
*NL*
could
be
no
other
than
the
object
of
his
visit
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
indeed
Mr.
Dawkins
,
who
,
shuffling
into
the
office
with
the
big
*NL*
coat
sleeves
tucked
up
as
usual
,
his
left
hand
in
his
pocket
,
and
his
*NL*
hat
in
his
right
hand
,
preceded
the
jailer
,
with
a
rolling
gait
*NL*
altogether
indescribable
,
and
,
taking
his
place
in
the
dock
,
requested
*NL*
in
an
audible
voice
to
know
what
he
was
placed
in
that
`
ere
disgraceful
*NL*
sitivation
for
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Hold
your
tongue
,
will
you
?
'
said
the
jailer
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
'm
an
Englishman
,
ai
n't
I
?
'
rejoined
the
Dodger
.
`
Where
are
my
*NL*
priwileges
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
'll
get
your
privileges
soon
enough
,
'
retorted
the
jailer
,
`
and
*NL*
pepper
with
'em
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
We
'll
see
wot
the
Secretary
of
State
for
the
Home
Affairs
has
got
to
*NL*
say
to
the
beaks
,
if
I
do
n't
,
'
replied
Mr.
Dawkins
.
`
Now
then
!
Wot
is
*NL*
this
here
business
?
I
shall
thank
the
madg
`
strates
to
dispose
of
this
*NL*
here
little
affair
,
and
not
to
keep
me
while
they
read
the
paper
,
for
*NL*
I
've
got
an
appointment
with
a
genelman
in
the
City
,
and
as
I
am
a
man
*NL*
of
my
word
and
wery
punctual
in
business
matters
,
he
'll
go
away
if
I
*NL*
ai
n't
there
to
my
time
,
and
then
pr
`
aps
ther
wo
n't
be
an
action
for
*NL*
damage
against
them
as
kep
me
away
.
Oh
no
,
certainly
not
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
point
,
the
Dodger
,
with
a
show
of
being
very
particular
with
a
*NL*
view
to
proceedings
to
be
had
thereafter
,
desired
the
jailer
to
*NL*
communicate
`
the
names
of
them
two
files
as
was
on
the
bench
.
'
Which
*NL*
so
tickled
the
spectators
,
that
they
laughed
almost
as
heartily
as
*NL*
Master
Bates
could
have
done
if
he
had
heard
the
request
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Silence
there
!
'
cried
the
jailer
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
is
this
?
'
inquired
one
of
the
magistrates
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
A
pick-pocketing
case
,
your
worship
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Has
the
boy
ever
been
here
before
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
ought
to
have
been
,
a
many
times
,
'
replied
the
jailer
.
`
He
has
been
*NL*
pretty
well
everywhere
else
.
_
I
_
know
him
well
,
your
worship
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
!
you
know
me
,
do
you
?
'
cried
the
Artful
,
making
a
note
of
the
*NL*
statement
.
`
Wery
good
.
That
's
a
case
of
deformation
of
character
,
any
*NL*
way
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Here
there
was
another
laugh
,
and
another
cry
of
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Now
then
,
where
are
the
witnesses
?
'
said
the
clerk
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ah
!
that
's
right
,
'
added
the
Dodger
.
`
Where
are
they
?
I
should
like
*NL*
to
see
'em
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
This
wish
was
immediately
gratified
,
for
a
policeman
stepped
forward
*NL*
who
had
seen
the
prisoner
attempt
the
pocket
of
an
unknown
gentleman
in
*NL*
a
crowd
,
and
indeed
take
a
handkerchief
therefrom
,
which
,
being
a
very
*NL*
old
one
,
he
deliberately
put
back
again
,
after
trying
it
on
his
own
*NL*
countenance
.
For
this
reason
,
he
took
the
Dodger
into
custody
as
soon
*NL*
as
he
could
get
near
him
,
and
the
said
Dodger
,
being
searched
,
had
upon
*NL*
his
person
a
silver
snuff-box
,
with
the
owner
's
name
engraved
upon
the
*NL*
lid
.
This
gentleman
had
been
discovered
on
reference
to
the
Court
*NL*
Guide
,
and
being
then
and
there
present
,
swore
that
the
snuff-box
was
*NL*
his
,
and
that
he
had
missed
it
on
the
previous
day
,
the
moment
he
had
*NL*
disengaged
himself
from
the
crowd
before
referred
to
.
He
had
also
*NL*
remarked
a
young
gentleman
in
the
throng
,
particularly
active
in
making
*NL*
his
way
about
,
and
that
young
gentleman
was
the
prisoner
before
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Have
you
anything
to
ask
this
witness
,
boy
?
'
said
the
magistrate
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
would
n't
abase
myself
by
descending
to
hold
no
conversation
with
*NL*
him
,
'
replied
the
Dodger
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Have
you
anything
to
say
at
all
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Do
you
hear
his
worship
ask
if
you
've
anything
to
say
?
'
inquired
the
*NL*
jailer
,
nudging
the
silent
Dodger
with
his
elbow
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
beg
your
pardon
,
'
said
the
Dodger
,
looking
up
with
an
air
of
*NL*
abstraction
.
`
Did
you
redress
yourself
to
me
,
my
man
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
never
see
such
an
out-and-out
young
wagabond
,
your
worship
,
'
*NL*
observed
the
officer
with
a
grin
.
`
Do
you
mean
to
say
anything
,
you
*NL*
young
shaver
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
'
replied
the
Dodger
,
`
not
here
,
for
this
ai
n't
the
shop
for
*NL*
justice
:
besides
which
,
my
attorney
is
a-breakfasting
this
morning
*NL*
with
the
Wice
President
of
the
House
of
Commons
;
but
I
shall
have
*NL*
something
to
say
elsewhere
,
and
so
will
he
,
and
so
will
a
wery
numerous
*NL*
and
`
spectable
circle
of
acquaintance
as
'll
make
them
beaks
wish
they
'd
*NL*
never
been
born
,
or
that
they
'd
got
their
footmen
to
hang
'em
up
to
*NL*
their
own
hat-pegs
,
afore
they
let
'em
come
out
this
morning
to
try
it
*NL*
on
upon
me
.
I
'll
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
There
!
He
's
fully
committed
!
'
interposed
the
clerk
.
`
Take
him
away
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Come
on
,
'
said
the
jailer
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
ah
!
I
'll
come
on
,
'
replied
the
Dodger
,
brushing
his
hat
with
the
*NL*
palm
of
his
hand
.
`
Ah
!
-LRB-
to
the
Bench
-RRB-
it
's
no
use
your
looking
*NL*
frightened
;
I
wo
n't
show
you
no
mercy
,
not
a
ha
`
porth
of
it
.
_
You
'll
_
*NL*
pay
for
this
,
my
fine
fellers
.
I
would
n't
be
you
for
something
!
I
*NL*
would
n't
go
free
,
now
,
if
you
was
to
fall
down
on
your
knees
and
ask
*NL*
me
.
Here
,
carry
me
off
to
prison
!
Take
me
away
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
With
these
last
words
,
the
Dodger
suffered
himself
to
be
led
off
by
the
*NL*
collar
;
threatening
,
till
he
got
into
the
yard
,
to
make
a
parliamentary
*NL*
business
of
it
;
and
then
grinning
in
the
officer
's
face
,
with
great
*NL*
glee
and
self-approval
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
seen
him
locked
up
by
himself
in
a
little
cell
,
Noah
made
the
*NL*
best
of
his
way
back
to
where
he
had
left
Master
Bates
.
After
waiting
*NL*
here
some
time
,
he
was
joined
by
that
young
gentleman
,
who
had
*NL*
prudently
abstained
from
showing
himself
until
he
had
looked
carefully
*NL*
abroad
from
a
snug
retreat
,
and
ascertained
that
his
new
friend
had
not
*NL*
been
followed
by
any
impertinent
person
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
hastened
back
together
,
to
bear
to
Mr.
Fagin
the
animating
news
*NL*
that
the
Dodger
was
doing
full
justice
to
his
bringing-up
,
and
*NL*
establishing
for
himself
a
glorious
reputation
.

CHAPTER
XLIV
*NL*
*NL*
THE
TIME
ARRIVES
FOR
NANCY
TO
REDEEM
HER
PLEDGE
TO
ROSE
MAYLIE
.
SHE
*NL*
FAILS
.
*NL*
*NL*
Adept
as
she
was
,
in
all
the
arts
of
cunning
and
dissimulation
,
the
*NL*
girl
Nancy
could
not
wholly
conceal
the
effect
which
the
knowledge
of
*NL*
the
step
she
had
taken
,
wrought
upon
her
mind
.
She
remembered
that
*NL*
both
the
crafty
Jew
and
the
brutal
Sikes
had
confided
to
her
schemes
,
*NL*
which
had
been
hidden
from
all
others
:
in
the
full
confidence
that
she
*NL*
was
trustworthy
and
beyond
the
reach
of
their
suspicion
.
Vile
as
those
*NL*
schemes
were
,
desperate
as
were
their
originators
,
and
bitter
as
were
*NL*
her
feelings
towards
Fagin
,
who
had
led
her
,
step
by
step
,
deeper
and
*NL*
deeper
down
into
an
abyss
of
crime
and
misery
,
whence
was
no
escape
;
*NL*
still
,
there
were
times
when
,
even
towards
him
,
she
felt
some
*NL*
relenting
,
lest
her
disclosure
should
bring
him
within
the
iron
grasp
*NL*
he
had
so
long
eluded
,
and
he
should
fall
at
last
--
richly
as
he
merited
*NL*
such
a
fate
--
by
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
these
were
the
mere
wanderings
of
a
mind
unable
wholly
to
detach
*NL*
itself
from
old
companions
and
associations
,
though
enabled
to
fix
*NL*
itself
steadily
on
one
object
,
and
resolved
not
to
be
turned
aside
by
*NL*
any
consideration
.
Her
fears
for
Sikes
would
have
been
more
powerful
*NL*
inducements
to
recoil
while
there
was
yet
time
;
but
she
had
stipulated
*NL*
that
her
secret
should
be
rigidly
kept
,
she
had
dropped
no
clue
which
*NL*
could
lead
to
his
discovery
,
she
had
refused
,
even
for
his
sake
,
a
*NL*
refuge
from
all
the
guilt
and
wretchedness
that
encompasses
her
--
and
*NL*
what
more
could
she
do
!
She
was
resolved
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
all
her
mental
struggles
terminated
in
this
conclusion
,
they
*NL*
forced
themselves
upon
her
,
again
and
again
,
and
left
their
traces
too
.
*NL*
She
grew
pale
and
thin
,
even
within
a
few
days
.
At
times
,
she
took
no
*NL*
heed
of
what
was
passing
before
her
,
or
no
part
in
conversations
where
*NL*
once
,
she
would
have
been
the
loudest
.
At
other
times
,
she
laughed
*NL*
without
merriment
,
and
was
noisy
without
a
moment
afterwards
--
she
sat
*NL*
silent
and
dejected
,
brooding
with
her
head
upon
her
hands
,
while
the
*NL*
very
effort
by
which
she
roused
herself
,
told
,
more
forcibly
than
even
*NL*
these
indications
,
that
she
was
ill
at
ease
,
and
that
her
thoughts
were
*NL*
occupied
with
matters
very
different
and
distant
from
those
in
the
*NL*
course
of
discussion
by
her
companions
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
Sunday
night
,
and
the
bell
of
the
nearest
church
struck
the
*NL*
hour
.
Sikes
and
the
Jew
were
talking
,
but
they
paused
to
listen
.
The
*NL*
girl
looked
up
from
the
low
seat
on
which
she
crouched
,
and
listened
*NL*
too
.
Eleven
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
An
hour
this
side
of
midnight
,
'
said
Sikes
,
raising
the
blind
to
look
*NL*
out
and
returning
to
his
seat
.
`
Dark
and
heavy
it
is
too
.
A
good
night
*NL*
for
business
this
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ah
!
'
replied
Fagin
.
`
What
a
pity
,
Bill
,
my
dear
,
that
there
's
none
*NL*
quite
ready
to
be
done
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
're
right
for
once
,
'
replied
Sikes
gruffly
.
`
It
is
a
pity
,
for
I
'm
*NL*
in
the
humour
too
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Fagin
sighed
,
and
shook
his
head
despondingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
We
must
make
up
for
lost
time
when
we
've
got
things
into
a
good
train
.
*NL*
That
's
all
I
know
,
'
said
Sikes
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
's
the
way
to
talk
,
my
dear
,
'
replied
Fagin
,
venturing
to
pat
him
*NL*
on
the
shoulder
.
`
It
does
me
good
to
hear
you
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Does
you
good
,
does
it
!
'
cried
Sikes
.
`
Well
,
so
be
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ha
!
ha
!
ha
!
'
laughed
Fagin
,
as
if
he
were
relieved
by
even
this
*NL*
concession
.
`
You
're
like
yourself
to-night
,
Bill
.
Quite
like
*NL*
yourself
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
do
n't
feel
like
myself
when
you
lay
that
withered
old
claw
on
my
*NL*
shoulder
,
so
take
it
away
,
'
said
Sikes
,
casting
off
the
Jew
's
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
make
you
nervous
,
Bill
,
--
reminds
you
of
being
nabbed
,
does
it
?
'
*NL*
said
Fagin
,
determined
not
to
be
offended
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Reminds
me
of
being
nabbed
by
the
devil
,
'
returned
Sikes
.
`
There
never
*NL*
was
another
man
with
such
a
face
as
yours
,
unless
it
was
your
father
,
*NL*
and
I
suppose
_
he
_
is
singeing
his
grizzled
red
beard
by
this
time
,
*NL*
unless
you
came
straight
from
the
old
`
un
without
any
father
at
all
*NL*
betwixt
you
;
which
I
should
n't
wonder
at
,
a
bit
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Fagin
offered
no
reply
to
this
compliment
:
but
,
pulling
Sikes
by
the
*NL*
sleeve
,
pointed
his
finger
towards
Nancy
,
who
had
taken
advantage
of
*NL*
the
foregoing
conversation
to
put
on
her
bonnet
,
and
was
now
leaving
*NL*
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Hallo
!
'
cried
Sikes
.
`
Nance
.
Where
's
the
gal
going
to
at
this
time
*NL*
of
night
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Not
far
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
answer
's
that
?
'
retorted
Sikes
.
`
Do
you
hear
me
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
do
n't
know
where
,
'
replied
the
girl
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Then
I
do
,
'
said
Sikes
,
more
in
the
spirit
of
obstinacy
than
because
*NL*
he
had
any
real
objection
to
the
girl
going
where
she
listed
.
*NL*
`
Nowhere
.
Sit
down
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
'm
not
well
.
I
told
you
that
before
,
'
rejoined
the
girl
.
'
I
want
a
*NL*
breath
of
air
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Put
your
head
out
of
the
winder
,
'
replied
Sikes
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
There
's
not
enough
there
,
'
said
the
girl
.
'
I
want
it
in
the
street
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Then
you
wo
n't
have
it
,
'
replied
Sikes
.
With
which
assurance
he
rose
,
*NL*
locked
the
door
,
took
the
key
out
,
and
pulling
her
bonnet
from
her
*NL*
head
,
flung
it
up
to
the
top
of
an
old
press
.
`
There
,
'
said
the
*NL*
robber
.
`
Now
stop
quietly
where
you
are
,
will
you
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
's
not
such
a
matter
as
a
bonnet
would
keep
me
,
'
said
the
girl
*NL*
turning
very
pale
.
`
What
do
you
mean
,
Bill
?
Do
you
know
what
you
're
*NL*
doing
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Know
what
I
'm
--
Oh
!
'
cried
Sikes
,
turning
to
Fagin
,
`
she
's
out
of
her
*NL*
senses
,
you
know
,
or
she
dare
n't
talk
to
me
in
that
way
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
'll
drive
me
on
the
something
desperate
,
'
muttered
the
girl
placing
*NL*
both
hands
upon
her
breast
,
as
though
to
keep
down
by
force
some
*NL*
violent
outbreak
.
`
Let
me
go
,
will
you
,
--
this
minute
--
this
instant
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
!
'
said
Sikes
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Tell
him
to
let
me
go
,
Fagin
.
He
had
better
.
It
'll
be
better
for
*NL*
him
.
Do
you
hear
me
?
'
cried
Nancy
stamping
her
foot
upon
the
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Hear
you
!
'
repeated
Sikes
turning
round
in
his
chair
to
confront
her
.
*NL*
`
Aye
!
And
if
I
hear
you
for
half
a
minute
longer
,
the
dog
shall
have
*NL*
such
a
grip
on
your
throat
as
'll
tear
some
of
that
screaming
voice
out
.
*NL*
Wot
has
come
over
you
,
you
jade
!
Wot
is
it
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Let
me
go
,
'
said
the
girl
with
great
earnestness
;
then
sitting
herself
*NL*
down
on
the
floor
,
before
the
door
,
she
said
,
`
Bill
,
let
me
go
;
you
*NL*
do
n't
know
what
you
are
doing
.
You
do
n't
,
indeed
.
For
only
one
*NL*
hour
--
do
--
do
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Cut
my
limbs
off
one
by
one
!
'
cried
Sikes
,
seizing
her
roughly
by
the
*NL*
arm
,
`
If
I
do
n't
think
the
gal
's
stark
raving
mad
.
Get
up
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Not
till
you
let
me
go
--
not
till
you
let
me
go
--
Never
--
never
!
'
*NL*
screamed
the
girl
.
Sikes
looked
on
,
for
a
minute
,
watching
his
*NL*
opportunity
,
and
suddenly
pinioning
her
hands
dragged
her
,
struggling
*NL*
and
wrestling
with
him
by
the
way
,
into
a
small
room
adjoining
,
where
*NL*
he
sat
himself
on
a
bench
,
and
thrusting
her
into
a
chair
,
held
her
*NL*
down
by
force
.
She
struggled
and
implored
by
turns
until
twelve
*NL*
o'clock
had
struck
,
and
then
,
wearied
and
exhausted
,
ceased
to
contest
*NL*
the
point
any
further
.
With
a
caution
,
backed
by
many
oaths
,
to
make
*NL*
no
more
efforts
to
go
out
that
night
,
Sikes
left
her
to
recover
at
*NL*
leisure
and
rejoined
Fagin
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Whew
!
'
said
the
housebreaker
wiping
the
perspiration
from
his
face
.
*NL*
`
Wot
a
precious
strange
gal
that
is
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
may
say
that
,
Bill
,
'
replied
Fagin
thoughtfully
.
`
You
may
say
*NL*
that
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Wot
did
she
take
it
into
her
head
to
go
out
to-night
for
,
do
you
*NL*
think
?
'
asked
Sikes
.
`
Come
;
you
should
know
her
better
than
me
.
Wot
*NL*
does
it
mean
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Obstinacy
;
woman
's
obstinacy
,
I
suppose
,
my
dear
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
I
suppose
it
is
,
'
growled
Sikes
.
'
I
thought
I
had
tamed
her
,
*NL*
but
she
's
as
bad
as
ever
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Worse
,
'
said
Fagin
thoughtfully
.
'
I
never
knew
her
like
this
,
for
*NL*
such
a
little
cause
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Nor
I
,
'
said
Sikes
.
'
I
think
she
's
got
a
touch
of
that
fever
in
her
*NL*
blood
yet
,
and
it
wo
n't
come
out
--
eh
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Like
enough
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
'll
let
her
a
little
blood
,
without
troubling
the
doctor
,
if
she
's
*NL*
took
that
way
again
,
'
said
Sikes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fagin
nodded
an
expressive
approval
of
this
mode
of
treatment
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
She
was
hanging
about
me
all
day
,
and
night
too
,
when
I
was
stretched
*NL*
on
my
back
;
and
you
,
like
a
blackhearted
wolf
as
you
are
,
kept
yourself
*NL*
aloof
,
'
said
Sikes
.
`
We
was
poor
too
,
all
the
time
,
and
I
think
,
one
*NL*
way
or
other
,
it
's
worried
and
fretted
her
;
and
that
being
shut
up
here
*NL*
so
long
has
made
her
restless
--
eh
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
's
it
,
my
dear
,
'
replied
the
Jew
in
a
whisper
.
`
Hush
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
uttered
these
words
,
the
girl
herself
appeared
and
resumed
her
*NL*
former
seat
.
Her
eyes
were
swollen
and
red
;
she
rocked
herself
to
and
*NL*
fro
;
tossed
her
head
;
and
,
after
a
little
time
,
burst
out
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
now
she
's
on
the
other
tack
!
'
exclaimed
Sikes
,
turning
a
look
of
*NL*
excessive
surprise
on
his
companion
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fagin
nodded
to
him
to
take
no
further
notice
just
then
;
and
,
in
a
few
*NL*
minutes
,
the
girl
subsided
into
her
accustomed
demeanour
.
Whispering
*NL*
Sikes
that
there
was
no
fear
of
her
relapsing
,
Fagin
took
up
his
hat
*NL*
and
bade
him
good-night
.
He
paused
when
he
reached
the
room-door
,
and
*NL*
looking
round
,
asked
if
somebody
would
light
him
down
the
dark
stairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Light
him
down
,
'
said
Sikes
,
who
was
filling
his
pipe
.
`
It
's
a
pity
he
*NL*
should
break
his
neck
himself
,
and
disappoint
the
sight-seers
.
Show
*NL*
him
a
light
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Nancy
followed
the
old
man
downstairs
,
with
a
candle
.
When
they
*NL*
reached
the
passage
,
he
laid
his
finger
on
his
lip
,
and
drawing
close
*NL*
to
the
girl
,
said
,
in
a
whisper
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
is
it
,
Nancy
,
dear
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
do
you
mean
?
'
replied
the
girl
,
in
the
same
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
reason
of
all
this
,
'
replied
Fagin
.
`
If
_
he
_
'
--
he
pointed
with
*NL*
his
skinny
fore-finger
up
the
stairs
--
`
is
so
hard
with
you
-LRB-
he
's
a
*NL*
brute
,
Nance
,
a
brute-beast
-RRB-
,
why
do
n't
you
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
?
'
said
the
girl
,
as
Fagin
paused
,
with
his
mouth
almost
touching
*NL*
her
ear
,
and
his
eyes
looking
into
hers
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
matter
just
now
.
We
'll
talk
of
this
again
.
You
have
a
friend
in
*NL*
me
,
Nance
;
a
staunch
friend
.
I
have
the
means
at
hand
,
quiet
and
*NL*
close
.
If
you
want
revenge
on
those
that
treat
you
like
a
dog
--
like
a
*NL*
dog
!
worse
than
his
dog
,
for
he
humours
him
sometimes
--
come
to
me
.
I
*NL*
say
,
come
to
me
.
He
is
the
mere
hound
of
a
day
,
but
you
know
me
of
*NL*
old
,
Nance
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
know
you
well
,
'
replied
the
girl
,
without
manifesting
the
least
*NL*
emotion
.
`
Good-night
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
shrank
back
,
as
Fagin
offered
to
lay
his
hand
on
hers
,
but
said
*NL*
good-night
again
,
in
a
steady
voice
,
and
,
answering
his
parting
look
*NL*
with
a
nod
of
intelligence
,
closed
the
door
between
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fagin
walked
towards
his
home
,
intent
upon
the
thoughts
that
were
*NL*
working
within
his
brain
.
He
had
conceived
the
idea
--
not
from
what
had
*NL*
just
passed
though
that
had
tended
to
confirm
him
,
but
slowly
and
by
*NL*
degrees
--
that
Nancy
,
wearied
of
the
housebreaker
's
brutality
,
had
*NL*
conceived
an
attachment
for
some
new
friend
.
Her
altered
manner
,
her
*NL*
repeated
absences
from
home
alone
,
her
comparative
indifference
to
the
*NL*
interests
of
the
gang
for
which
she
had
once
been
so
zealous
,
and
,
*NL*
added
to
these
,
her
desperate
impatience
to
leave
home
that
night
at
a
*NL*
particular
hour
,
all
favoured
the
supposition
,
and
rendered
it
,
to
him
*NL*
at
least
,
almost
matter
of
certainty
.
The
object
of
this
new
liking
*NL*
was
not
among
his
myrmidons
.
He
would
be
a
valuable
acquisition
with
*NL*
such
an
assistant
as
Nancy
,
and
must
-LRB-
thus
Fagin
argued
-RRB-
be
secured
*NL*
without
delay
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
another
,
and
a
darker
object
,
to
be
gained
.
Sikes
knew
too
*NL*
much
,
and
his
ruffian
taunts
had
not
galled
Fagin
the
less
,
because
the
*NL*
wounds
were
hidden
.
The
girl
must
know
,
well
,
that
if
she
shook
him
*NL*
off
,
she
could
never
be
safe
from
his
fury
,
and
that
it
would
be
surely
*NL*
wreaked
--
to
the
maiming
of
limbs
,
or
perhaps
the
loss
of
life
--
on
the
*NL*
object
of
her
more
recent
fancy
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
With
a
little
persuasion
,
'
thought
Fagin
,
`
what
more
likely
than
that
*NL*
she
would
consent
to
poison
him
?
Women
have
done
such
things
,
and
*NL*
worse
,
to
secure
the
same
object
before
now
.
There
would
be
the
*NL*
dangerous
villain
:
the
man
I
hate
:
gone
;
another
secured
in
his
*NL*
place
;
and
my
influence
over
the
girl
,
with
a
knowledge
of
this
crime
*NL*
to
back
it
,
unlimited
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
These
things
passed
through
the
mind
of
Fagin
,
during
the
short
time
he
*NL*
sat
alone
,
in
the
housebreaker
's
room
;
and
with
them
uppermost
in
his
*NL*
thoughts
,
he
had
taken
the
opportunity
afterwards
afforded
him
,
of
*NL*
sounding
the
girl
in
the
broken
hints
he
threw
out
at
parting
.
There
*NL*
was
no
expression
of
surprise
,
no
assumption
of
an
inability
to
*NL*
understand
his
meaning
.
The
girl
clearly
comprehended
it
.
Her
glance
*NL*
at
parting
showed
_
that
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
perhaps
she
would
recoil
from
a
plot
to
take
the
life
of
Sikes
,
and
*NL*
that
was
one
of
the
chief
ends
to
be
attained
.
`
How
,
'
thought
Fagin
,
as
*NL*
he
crept
homeward
,
`
can
I
increase
my
influence
with
her
?
What
new
*NL*
power
can
I
acquire
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
Such
brains
are
fertile
in
expedients
.
If
,
without
extracting
a
*NL*
confession
from
herself
,
he
laid
a
watch
,
discovered
the
object
of
her
*NL*
altered
regard
,
and
threatened
to
reveal
the
whole
history
to
Sikes
-LRB-
of
*NL*
whom
she
stood
in
no
common
fear
-RRB-
unless
she
entered
into
his
designs
,
*NL*
could
he
not
secure
her
compliance
?
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
can
,
'
said
Fagin
,
almost
aloud
.
`
She
durst
not
refuse
me
then
.
Not
*NL*
for
her
life
,
not
for
her
life
!
I
have
it
all
.
The
means
are
ready
,
*NL*
and
shall
be
set
to
work
.
I
shall
have
you
yet
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
cast
back
a
dark
look
,
and
a
threatening
motion
of
the
hand
,
towards
*NL*
the
spot
where
he
had
left
the
bolder
villain
;
and
went
on
his
way
:
*NL*
busying
his
bony
hands
in
the
folds
of
his
tattered
garment
,
which
he
*NL*
wrenched
tightly
in
his
grasp
,
as
though
there
were
a
hated
enemy
*NL*
crushed
with
every
motion
of
his
fingers
.

CHAPTER
XLV
*NL*
*NL*
NOAH
CLAYPOLE
IS
EMPLOYED
BY
FAGIN
ON
A
SECRET
MISSION
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
man
was
up
,
betimes
,
next
morning
,
and
waited
impatiently
for
*NL*
the
appearance
of
his
new
associate
,
who
after
a
delay
that
seemed
*NL*
interminable
,
at
length
presented
himself
,
and
commenced
a
voracious
*NL*
assault
on
the
breakfast
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Bolter
,
'
said
Fagin
,
drawing
up
a
chair
and
seating
himself
opposite
*NL*
Morris
Bolter
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
here
I
am
,
'
returned
Noah
.
`
What
's
the
matter
?
Do
n't
yer
ask
*NL*
me
to
do
anything
till
I
have
done
eating
.
That
's
a
great
fault
in
this
*NL*
place
.
Yer
never
get
time
enough
over
yer
meals
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
can
talk
as
you
eat
,
ca
n't
you
?
'
said
Fagin
,
cursing
his
dear
*NL*
young
friend
's
greediness
from
the
very
bottom
of
his
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
yes
,
I
can
talk
.
I
get
on
better
when
I
talk
,
'
said
Noah
,
cutting
*NL*
a
monstrous
slice
of
bread
.
`
Where
's
Charlotte
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Out
,
'
said
Fagin
.
'
I
sent
her
out
this
morning
with
the
other
young
*NL*
woman
,
because
I
wanted
us
to
be
alone
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
!
'
said
Noah
.
'
I
wish
yer
'd
ordered
her
to
make
some
buttered
toast
*NL*
first
.
Well
.
Talk
away
.
Yer
wo
n't
interrupt
me
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
There
seemed
,
indeed
,
no
great
fear
of
anything
interrupting
him
,
as
he
*NL*
had
evidently
sat
down
with
a
determination
to
do
a
great
deal
of
*NL*
business
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
did
well
yesterday
,
my
dear
,
'
said
Fagin
.
`
Beautiful
!
Six
*NL*
shillings
and
ninepence
halfpenny
on
the
very
first
day
!
The
kinchin
*NL*
lay
will
be
a
fortune
to
you
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Do
n't
you
forget
to
add
three
pint-pots
and
a
milk-can
,
'
said
Mr.
*NL*
Bolter
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
no
,
my
dear
.
The
pint-pots
were
great
strokes
of
genius
:
but
the
*NL*
milk-can
was
a
perfect
masterpiece
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Pretty
well
,
I
think
,
for
a
beginner
,
'
remarked
Mr.
Bolter
*NL*
complacently
.
`
The
pots
I
took
off
airy
railings
,
and
the
milk-can
was
*NL*
standing
by
itself
outside
a
public-house
.
I
thought
it
might
get
*NL*
rusty
with
the
rain
,
or
catch
cold
,
yer
know
.
Eh
?
Ha
!
ha
!
ha
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Fagin
affected
to
laugh
very
heartily
;
and
Mr.
Bolter
having
had
his
*NL*
laugh
out
,
took
a
series
of
large
bites
,
which
finished
his
first
hunk
*NL*
of
bread
and
butter
,
and
assisted
himself
to
a
second
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
want
you
,
Bolter
,
'
said
Fagin
,
leaning
over
the
table
,
`
to
do
a
*NL*
piece
of
work
for
me
,
my
dear
,
that
needs
great
care
and
caution
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
say
,
'
rejoined
Bolter
,
`
do
n't
yer
go
shoving
me
into
danger
,
or
*NL*
sending
me
any
more
o
'
yer
police-offices
.
That
do
n't
suit
me
,
that
*NL*
do
n't
;
and
so
I
tell
yer
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
's
not
the
smallest
danger
in
it
--
not
the
very
smallest
,
'
said
the
*NL*
Jew
;
`
it
's
only
to
dodge
a
woman
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
An
old
woman
?
'
demanded
Mr.
Bolter
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
A
young
one
,
'
replied
Fagin
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
can
do
that
pretty
well
,
I
know
,
'
said
Bolter
.
'
I
was
a
regular
*NL*
cunning
sneak
when
I
was
at
school
.
What
am
I
to
dodge
her
for
?
Not
*NL*
to
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Not
to
do
anything
,
but
to
tell
me
where
she
goes
,
who
she
sees
,
and
,
*NL*
if
possible
,
what
she
says
;
to
remember
the
street
,
if
it
is
a
street
,
*NL*
or
the
house
,
if
it
is
a
house
;
and
to
bring
me
back
all
the
*NL*
information
you
can
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
'll
yer
give
me
?
'
asked
Noah
,
setting
down
his
cup
,
and
looking
*NL*
his
employer
,
eagerly
,
in
the
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
If
you
do
it
well
,
a
pound
,
my
dear
.
One
pound
,
'
said
Fagin
,
wishing
*NL*
to
interest
him
in
the
scent
as
much
as
possible
.
`
And
that
's
what
I
*NL*
never
gave
yet
,
for
any
job
of
work
where
there
was
n't
valuable
*NL*
consideration
to
be
gained
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Who
is
she
?
'
inquired
Noah
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
One
of
us
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
Lor
!
'
cried
Noah
,
curling
up
his
nose
.
`
Yer
doubtful
of
her
,
are
*NL*
yer
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
She
has
found
out
some
new
friends
,
my
dear
,
and
I
must
know
who
they
*NL*
are
,
'
replied
Fagin
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
see
,
'
said
Noah
.
`
Just
to
have
the
pleasure
of
knowing
them
,
if
*NL*
they
're
respectable
people
,
eh
?
Ha
!
ha
!
ha
!
I
'm
your
man
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
knew
you
would
be
,
'
cried
Fagin
,
elated
by
the
success
of
his
*NL*
proposal
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Of
course
,
of
course
,
'
replied
Noah
.
`
Where
is
she
?
Where
am
I
to
*NL*
wait
for
her
?
Where
am
I
to
go
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
All
that
,
my
dear
,
you
shall
hear
from
me
.
I
'll
point
her
out
at
the
*NL*
proper
time
,
'
said
Fagin
.
`
You
keep
ready
,
and
leave
the
rest
to
me
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
That
night
,
and
the
next
,
and
the
next
again
,
the
spy
sat
booted
and
*NL*
equipped
in
his
carter
's
dress
:
ready
to
turn
out
at
a
word
from
*NL*
Fagin
.
Six
nights
passed
--
six
long
weary
nights
--
and
on
each
,
Fagin
*NL*
came
home
with
a
disappointed
face
,
and
briefly
intimated
that
it
was
*NL*
not
yet
time
.
On
the
seventh
,
he
returned
earlier
,
and
with
an
*NL*
exultation
he
could
not
conceal
.
It
was
Sunday
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
She
goes
abroad
to-night
,
'
said
Fagin
,
`
and
on
the
right
errand
,
I
'm
*NL*
sure
;
for
she
has
been
alone
all
day
,
and
the
man
she
is
afraid
of
will
*NL*
not
be
back
much
before
daybreak
.
Come
with
me
.
Quick
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Noah
started
up
without
saying
a
word
;
for
the
Jew
was
in
a
state
of
*NL*
such
intense
excitement
that
it
infected
him
.
They
left
the
house
*NL*
stealthily
,
and
hurrying
through
a
labyrinth
of
streets
,
arrived
at
*NL*
length
before
a
public-house
,
which
Noah
recognised
as
the
same
in
*NL*
which
he
had
slept
,
on
the
night
of
his
arrival
in
London
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
past
eleven
o'clock
,
and
the
door
was
closed
.
It
opened
softly
*NL*
on
its
hinges
as
Fagin
gave
a
low
whistle
.
They
entered
,
without
noise
;
*NL*
and
the
door
was
closed
behind
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Scarcely
venturing
to
whisper
,
but
substituting
dumb
show
for
words
,
*NL*
Fagin
,
and
the
young
Jew
who
had
admitted
them
,
pointed
out
the
pane
of
*NL*
glass
to
Noah
,
and
signed
to
him
to
climb
up
and
observe
the
person
in
*NL*
the
adjoining
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Is
that
the
woman
?
'
he
asked
,
scarcely
above
his
breath
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fagin
nodded
yes
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
ca
n't
see
her
face
well
,
'
whispered
Noah
.
`
She
is
looking
down
,
and
*NL*
the
candle
is
behind
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Stay
there
,
'
whispered
Fagin
.
He
signed
to
Barney
,
who
withdrew
.
In
*NL*
an
instant
,
the
lad
entered
the
room
adjoining
,
and
,
under
pretence
of
*NL*
snuffing
the
candle
,
moved
it
in
the
required
position
,
and
,
speaking
*NL*
to
the
girl
,
caused
her
to
raise
her
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
see
her
now
,
'
cried
the
spy
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Plainly
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
should
know
her
among
a
thousand
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
hastily
descended
,
as
the
room-door
opened
,
and
the
girl
came
out
.
*NL*
Fagin
drew
him
behind
a
small
partition
which
was
curtained
off
,
and
*NL*
they
held
their
breaths
as
she
passed
within
a
few
feet
of
their
place
*NL*
of
concealment
,
and
emerged
by
the
door
at
which
they
had
entered
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Hist
!
'
cried
the
lad
who
held
the
door
.
`
Dow
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Noah
exchanged
a
look
with
Fagin
,
and
darted
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
To
the
left
,
'
whispered
the
lad
;
`
take
the
left
had
,
and
keep
od
the
*NL*
other
side
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
so
;
and
,
by
the
light
of
the
lamps
,
saw
the
girl
's
retreating
*NL*
figure
,
already
at
some
distance
before
him
.
He
advanced
as
near
as
he
*NL*
considered
prudent
,
and
kept
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
,
the
*NL*
better
to
observe
her
motions
.
She
looked
nervously
round
,
twice
or
*NL*
thrice
,
and
once
stopped
to
let
two
men
who
were
following
close
behind
*NL*
her
,
pass
on
.
She
seemed
to
gather
courage
as
she
advanced
,
and
to
*NL*
walk
with
a
steadier
and
firmer
step
.
The
spy
preserved
the
same
*NL*
relative
distance
between
them
,
and
followed
:
with
his
eye
upon
her
.

CHAPTER
XLVI
*NL*
*NL*
THE
APPOINTMENT
KEPT
*NL*
*NL*
The
church
clocks
chimed
three
quarters
past
eleven
,
as
two
figures
*NL*
emerged
on
London
Bridge
.
One
,
which
advanced
with
a
swift
and
rapid
*NL*
step
,
was
that
of
a
woman
who
looked
eagerly
about
her
as
though
in
*NL*
quest
of
some
expected
object
;
the
other
figure
was
that
of
a
man
,
who
*NL*
slunk
along
in
the
deepest
shadow
he
could
find
,
and
,
at
some
distance
,
*NL*
accommodated
his
pace
to
hers
:
stopping
when
she
stopped
:
and
as
she
*NL*
moved
again
,
creeping
stealthily
on
:
but
never
allowing
himself
,
in
*NL*
the
ardour
of
his
pursuit
,
to
gain
upon
her
footsteps
.
Thus
,
they
*NL*
crossed
the
bridge
,
from
the
Middlesex
to
the
Surrey
shore
,
when
the
*NL*
woman
,
apparently
disappointed
in
her
anxious
scrutiny
of
the
*NL*
foot-passengers
,
turned
back
.
The
movement
was
sudden
;
but
he
who
*NL*
watched
her
,
was
not
thrown
off
his
guard
by
it
;
for
,
shrinking
into
*NL*
one
of
the
recesses
which
surmount
the
piers
of
the
bridge
,
and
leaning
*NL*
over
the
parapet
the
better
to
conceal
his
figure
,
he
suffered
her
to
*NL*
pass
on
the
opposite
pavement
.
When
she
was
about
the
same
distance
in
*NL*
advance
as
she
had
been
before
,
he
slipped
quietly
down
,
and
followed
*NL*
her
again
.
At
nearly
the
centre
of
the
bridge
,
she
stopped
.
The
man
*NL*
stopped
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
very
dark
night
.
The
day
had
been
unfavourable
,
and
at
that
*NL*
hour
and
place
there
were
few
people
stirring
.
Such
as
there
were
,
*NL*
hurried
quickly
past
:
very
possibly
without
seeing
,
but
certainly
*NL*
without
noticing
,
either
the
woman
,
or
the
man
who
kept
her
in
view
.
*NL*
Their
appearance
was
not
calculated
to
attract
the
importunate
regards
*NL*
of
such
of
London
's
destitute
population
,
as
chanced
to
take
their
way
*NL*
over
the
bridge
that
night
in
search
of
some
cold
arch
or
doorless
*NL*
hovel
wherein
to
lay
their
heads
;
they
stood
there
in
silence
:
neither
*NL*
speaking
nor
spoken
to
,
by
any
one
who
passed
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
mist
hung
over
the
river
,
deepening
the
red
glare
of
the
fires
that
*NL*
burnt
upon
the
small
craft
moored
off
the
different
wharfs
,
and
*NL*
rendering
darker
and
more
indistinct
the
murky
buildings
on
the
banks
.
*NL*
The
old
smoke-stained
storehouses
on
either
side
,
rose
heavy
and
dull
*NL*
from
the
dense
mass
of
roofs
and
gables
,
and
frowned
sternly
upon
water
*NL*
too
black
to
reflect
even
their
lumbering
shapes
.
The
tower
of
old
*NL*
Saint
Saviour
's
Church
,
and
the
spire
of
Saint
Magnus
,
so
long
the
*NL*
giant-warders
of
the
ancient
bridge
,
were
visible
in
the
gloom
;
but
the
*NL*
forest
of
shipping
below
bridge
,
and
the
thickly
scattered
spires
of
*NL*
churches
above
,
were
nearly
all
hidden
from
sight
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
girl
had
taken
a
few
restless
turns
to
and
fro
--
closely
watched
*NL*
meanwhile
by
her
hidden
observer
--
when
the
heavy
bell
of
St.
Paul
's
*NL*
tolled
for
the
death
of
another
day
.
Midnight
had
come
upon
the
*NL*
crowded
city
.
The
palace
,
the
night-cellar
,
the
jail
,
the
madhouse
:
*NL*
the
chambers
of
birth
and
death
,
of
health
and
sickness
,
the
rigid
face
*NL*
of
the
corpse
and
the
calm
sleep
of
the
child
:
midnight
was
upon
them
*NL*
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
hour
had
not
struck
two
minutes
,
when
a
young
lady
,
accompanied
by
*NL*
a
grey-haired
gentleman
,
alighted
from
a
hackney-carriage
within
a
*NL*
short
distance
of
the
bridge
,
and
,
having
dismissed
the
vehicle
,
walked
*NL*
straight
towards
it
.
They
had
scarcely
set
foot
upon
its
pavement
,
*NL*
when
the
girl
started
,
and
immediately
made
towards
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
walked
onward
,
looking
about
them
with
the
air
of
persons
who
*NL*
entertained
some
very
slight
expectation
which
had
little
chance
of
*NL*
being
realised
,
when
they
were
suddenly
joined
by
this
new
associate
.
*NL*
They
halted
with
an
exclamation
of
surprise
,
but
suppressed
it
*NL*
immediately
;
for
a
man
in
the
garments
of
a
countryman
came
close
*NL*
up
--
brushed
against
them
,
indeed
--
at
that
precise
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Not
here
,
'
said
Nancy
hurriedly
,
'
I
am
afraid
to
speak
to
you
here
.
*NL*
Come
away
--
out
of
the
public
road
--
down
the
steps
yonder
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
uttered
these
words
,
and
indicated
,
with
her
hand
,
the
direction
*NL*
in
which
she
wished
them
to
proceed
,
the
countryman
looked
round
,
and
*NL*
roughly
asking
what
they
took
up
the
whole
pavement
for
,
passed
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
steps
to
which
the
girl
had
pointed
,
were
those
which
,
on
the
*NL*
Surrey
bank
,
and
on
the
same
side
of
the
bridge
as
Saint
Saviour
's
*NL*
Church
,
form
a
landing-stairs
from
the
river
.
To
this
spot
,
the
man
*NL*
bearing
the
appearance
of
a
countryman
,
hastened
unobserved
;
and
after
*NL*
a
moment
's
survey
of
the
place
,
he
began
to
descend
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
stairs
are
a
part
of
the
bridge
;
they
consist
of
three
flights
.
*NL*
Just
below
the
end
of
the
second
,
going
down
,
the
stone
wall
on
the
*NL*
left
terminates
in
an
ornamental
pilaster
facing
towards
the
Thames
.
*NL*
At
this
point
the
lower
steps
widen
:
so
that
a
person
turning
that
*NL*
angle
of
the
wall
,
is
necessarily
unseen
by
any
others
on
the
stairs
*NL*
who
chance
to
be
above
him
,
if
only
a
step
.
The
countryman
looked
*NL*
hastily
round
,
when
he
reached
this
point
;
and
as
there
seemed
no
*NL*
better
place
of
concealment
,
and
,
the
tide
being
out
,
there
was
plenty
*NL*
of
room
,
he
slipped
aside
,
with
his
back
to
the
pilaster
,
and
there
*NL*
waited
:
pretty
certain
that
they
would
come
no
lower
,
and
that
even
if
*NL*
he
could
not
hear
what
was
said
,
he
could
follow
them
again
,
with
*NL*
safety
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
tardily
stole
the
time
in
this
lonely
place
,
and
so
eager
was
the
*NL*
spy
to
penetrate
the
motives
of
an
interview
so
different
from
what
he
*NL*
had
been
led
to
expect
,
that
he
more
than
once
gave
the
matter
up
for
*NL*
lost
,
and
persuaded
himself
,
either
that
they
had
stopped
far
above
,
or
*NL*
had
resorted
to
some
entirely
different
spot
to
hold
their
mysterious
*NL*
conversation
.
He
was
on
the
point
of
emerging
from
his
hiding-place
,
*NL*
and
regaining
the
road
above
,
when
he
heard
the
sound
of
footsteps
,
and
*NL*
directly
afterwards
of
voices
almost
close
at
his
ear
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
drew
himself
straight
upright
against
the
wall
,
and
,
scarcely
*NL*
breathing
,
listened
attentively
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
This
is
far
enough
,
'
said
a
voice
,
which
was
evidently
that
of
the
*NL*
gentleman
.
'
I
will
not
suffer
the
young
lady
to
go
any
farther
.
Many
*NL*
people
would
have
distrusted
you
too
much
to
have
come
even
so
far
,
but
*NL*
you
see
I
am
willing
to
humour
you
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
To
humour
me
!
'
cried
the
voice
of
the
girl
whom
he
had
followed
.
*NL*
`
You
're
considerate
,
indeed
,
sir
.
To
humour
me
!
Well
,
well
,
it
's
no
*NL*
matter
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
for
what
,
'
said
the
gentleman
in
a
kinder
tone
,
`
for
what
purpose
*NL*
can
you
have
brought
us
to
this
strange
place
?
Why
not
have
let
me
*NL*
speak
to
you
,
above
there
,
where
it
is
light
,
and
there
is
something
*NL*
stirring
,
instead
of
bringing
us
to
this
dark
and
dismal
hole
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
told
you
before
,
'
replied
Nancy
,
`
that
I
was
afraid
to
speak
to
you
*NL*
there
.
I
do
n't
know
why
it
is
,
'
said
the
girl
,
shuddering
,
`
but
I
have
*NL*
such
a
fear
and
dread
upon
me
to-night
that
I
can
hardly
stand
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
A
fear
of
what
?
'
asked
the
gentleman
,
who
seemed
to
pity
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
scarcely
know
of
what
,
'
replied
the
girl
.
'
I
wish
I
did
.
Horrible
*NL*
thoughts
of
death
,
and
shrouds
with
blood
upon
them
,
and
a
fear
that
*NL*
has
made
me
burn
as
if
I
was
on
fire
,
have
been
upon
me
all
day
.
I
was
*NL*
reading
a
book
to-night
,
to
wile
the
time
away
,
and
the
same
things
*NL*
came
into
the
print
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Imagination
,
'
said
the
gentleman
,
soothing
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
imagination
,
'
replied
the
girl
in
a
hoarse
voice
.
`
I
'll
swear
I
saw
*NL*
``
coffin
''
written
in
every
page
of
the
book
in
large
black
*NL*
letters
,
--
aye
,
and
they
carried
one
close
to
me
,
in
the
streets
*NL*
to-night
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
There
is
nothing
unusual
in
that
,
'
said
the
gentleman
.
`
They
have
*NL*
passed
me
often
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
_
Real
ones
_
,
'
rejoined
the
girl
.
`
This
was
not
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
something
so
uncommon
in
her
manner
,
that
the
flesh
of
the
*NL*
concealed
listener
crept
as
he
heard
the
girl
utter
these
words
,
and
*NL*
the
blood
chilled
within
him
.
He
had
never
experienced
a
greater
*NL*
relief
than
in
hearing
the
sweet
voice
of
the
young
lady
as
she
begged
*NL*
her
to
be
calm
,
and
not
allow
herself
to
become
the
prey
of
such
*NL*
fearful
fancies
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Speak
to
her
kindly
,
'
said
the
young
lady
to
her
companion
.
`
Poor
*NL*
creature
!
She
seems
to
need
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Your
haughty
religious
people
would
have
held
their
heads
up
to
see
me
*NL*
as
I
am
to-night
,
and
preached
of
flames
and
vengeance
,
'
cried
the
*NL*
girl
.
`
Oh
,
dear
lady
,
why
ar
'n'
t
those
who
claim
to
be
God
's
own
folks
*NL*
as
gentle
and
as
kind
to
us
poor
wretches
as
you
,
who
,
having
youth
,
*NL*
and
beauty
,
and
all
that
they
have
lost
,
might
be
a
little
proud
*NL*
instead
of
so
much
humbler
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ah
!
'
said
the
gentleman
.
'
A
Turk
turns
his
face
,
after
washing
it
*NL*
well
,
to
the
East
,
when
he
says
his
prayers
;
these
good
people
,
after
*NL*
giving
their
faces
such
a
rub
against
the
World
as
to
take
the
smiles
*NL*
off
,
turn
with
no
less
regularity
,
to
the
darkest
side
of
Heaven
.
*NL*
Between
the
Mussulman
and
the
Pharisee
,
commend
me
to
the
first
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
These
words
appeared
to
be
addressed
to
the
young
lady
,
and
were
*NL*
perhaps
uttered
with
the
view
of
affording
Nancy
time
to
recover
*NL*
herself
.
The
gentleman
,
shortly
afterwards
,
addressed
himself
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
were
not
here
last
Sunday
night
,
'
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
could
n't
come
,
'
replied
Nancy
;
'
I
was
kept
by
force
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
By
whom
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Him
that
I
told
the
young
lady
of
before
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
were
not
suspected
of
holding
any
communication
with
anybody
on
*NL*
the
subject
which
has
brought
us
here
to-night
,
I
hope
?
'
asked
the
old
*NL*
gentleman
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
'
replied
the
girl
,
shaking
her
head
.
`
It
's
not
very
easy
for
me
*NL*
to
leave
him
unless
he
knows
why
;
I
could
n't
give
him
a
drink
of
*NL*
laudanum
before
I
came
away
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Did
he
awake
before
you
returned
?
'
inquired
the
gentleman
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
;
and
neither
he
nor
any
of
them
suspect
me
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Good
,
'
said
the
gentleman
.
`
Now
listen
to
me
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
am
ready
,
'
replied
the
girl
,
as
he
paused
for
a
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
This
young
lady
,
'
the
gentleman
began
,
`
has
communicated
to
me
,
and
to
*NL*
some
other
friends
who
can
be
safely
trusted
,
what
you
told
her
nearly
*NL*
a
fortnight
since
.
I
confess
to
you
that
I
had
doubts
,
at
first
,
*NL*
whether
you
were
to
be
implicitly
relied
upon
,
but
now
I
firmly
believe
*NL*
you
are
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
am
,
'
said
the
girl
earnestly
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
repeat
that
I
firmly
believe
it
.
To
prove
to
you
that
I
am
disposed
*NL*
to
trust
you
,
I
tell
you
without
reserve
,
that
we
propose
to
extort
the
*NL*
secret
,
whatever
it
may
be
,
from
the
fear
of
this
man
Monks
.
But
*NL*
if
--
if
--
'
said
the
gentleman
,
`
he
can
not
be
secured
,
or
,
if
secured
,
*NL*
can
not
be
acted
upon
as
we
wish
,
you
must
deliver
up
the
Jew
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Fagin
,
'
cried
the
girl
,
recoiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
man
must
be
delivered
up
by
you
,
'
said
the
gentleman
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
will
not
do
it
!
I
will
never
do
it
!
'
replied
the
girl
.
`
Devil
that
*NL*
he
is
,
and
worse
than
devil
as
he
has
been
to
me
,
I
will
never
do
that
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
will
not
?
'
said
the
gentleman
,
who
seemed
fully
prepared
for
this
*NL*
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Never
!
'
returned
the
girl
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Tell
me
why
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
For
one
reason
,
'
rejoined
the
girl
firmly
,
`
for
one
reason
,
that
the
*NL*
lady
knows
and
will
stand
by
me
in
,
I
know
she
will
,
for
I
have
her
*NL*
promise
:
and
for
this
other
reason
,
besides
,
that
,
bad
life
as
he
has
*NL*
led
,
I
have
led
a
bad
life
too
;
there
are
many
of
us
who
have
kept
the
*NL*
same
courses
together
,
and
I
'll
not
turn
upon
them
,
who
might
--
any
of
*NL*
them
--
have
turned
upon
me
,
but
did
n't
,
bad
as
they
are
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Then
,
'
said
the
gentleman
,
quickly
,
as
if
this
had
been
the
point
he
*NL*
had
been
aiming
to
attain
;
`
put
Monks
into
my
hands
,
and
leave
him
to
*NL*
me
to
deal
with
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
if
he
turns
against
the
others
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
promise
you
that
in
that
case
,
if
the
truth
is
forced
from
him
,
*NL*
there
the
matter
will
rest
;
there
must
be
circumstances
in
Oliver
's
*NL*
little
history
which
it
would
be
painful
to
drag
before
the
public
eye
,
*NL*
and
if
the
truth
is
once
elicited
,
they
shall
go
scot
free
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
if
it
is
not
?
'
suggested
the
girl
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Then
,
'
pursued
the
gentleman
,
`
this
Fagin
shall
not
be
brought
to
*NL*
justice
without
your
consent
.
In
such
a
case
I
could
show
you
reasons
,
*NL*
I
think
,
which
would
induce
you
to
yield
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Have
I
the
lady
's
promise
for
that
?
'
asked
the
girl
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
have
,
'
replied
Rose
.
`
My
true
and
faithful
pledge
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Monks
would
never
learn
how
you
knew
what
you
do
?
'
said
the
girl
,
*NL*
after
a
short
pause
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Never
,
'
replied
the
gentleman
.
`
The
intelligence
should
be
brought
to
*NL*
bear
upon
him
,
that
he
could
never
even
guess
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
have
been
a
liar
,
and
among
liars
from
a
little
child
,
'
said
the
*NL*
girl
after
another
interval
of
silence
,
`
but
I
will
take
your
words
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
After
receiving
an
assurance
from
both
,
that
she
might
safely
do
so
,
*NL*
she
proceeded
in
a
voice
so
low
that
it
was
often
difficult
for
the
*NL*
listener
to
discover
even
the
purport
of
what
she
said
,
to
describe
,
by
*NL*
name
and
situation
,
the
public-house
whence
she
had
been
followed
that
*NL*
night
.
From
the
manner
in
which
she
occasionally
paused
,
it
appeared
*NL*
as
if
the
gentleman
were
making
some
hasty
notes
of
the
information
she
*NL*
communicated
.
When
she
had
thoroughly
explained
the
localities
of
the
*NL*
place
,
the
best
position
from
which
to
watch
it
without
exciting
*NL*
observation
,
and
the
night
and
hour
on
which
Monks
was
most
in
the
*NL*
habit
of
frequenting
it
,
she
seemed
to
consider
for
a
few
moments
,
for
*NL*
the
purpose
of
recalling
his
features
and
appearances
more
forcibly
to
*NL*
her
recollection
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
is
tall
,
'
said
the
girl
,
`
and
a
strongly
made
man
,
but
not
stout
;
*NL*
he
has
a
lurking
walk
;
and
as
he
walks
,
constantly
looks
over
his
*NL*
shoulder
,
first
on
one
side
,
and
then
on
the
other
.
Do
n't
forget
that
,
*NL*
for
his
eyes
are
sunk
in
his
head
so
much
deeper
than
any
other
man
's
,
*NL*
that
you
might
almost
tell
him
by
that
alone
.
His
face
is
dark
,
like
*NL*
his
hair
and
eyes
;
and
,
although
he
ca
n't
be
more
than
six
or
eight
and
*NL*
twenty
,
withered
and
haggard
.
His
lips
are
often
discoloured
and
*NL*
disfigured
with
the
marks
of
teeth
;
for
he
has
desperate
fits
,
and
*NL*
sometimes
even
bites
his
hands
and
covers
them
with
wounds
--
why
did
you
*NL*
start
?
'
said
the
girl
,
stopping
suddenly
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
gentleman
replied
,
in
a
hurried
manner
,
that
he
was
not
conscious
*NL*
of
having
done
so
,
and
begged
her
to
proceed
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Part
of
this
,
'
said
the
girl
,
'
I
have
drawn
out
from
other
people
at
*NL*
the
house
I
tell
you
of
,
for
I
have
only
seen
him
twice
,
and
both
times
*NL*
he
was
covered
up
in
a
large
cloak
.
I
think
that
's
all
I
can
give
you
*NL*
to
know
him
by
.
Stay
though
,
'
she
added
.
`
Upon
his
throat
:
so
high
*NL*
that
you
can
see
a
part
of
it
below
his
neckerchief
when
he
turns
his
*NL*
face
:
there
is
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
A
broad
red
mark
,
like
a
burn
or
scald
?
'
cried
the
gentleman
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
How
's
this
?
'
said
the
girl
.
`
You
know
him
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
lady
uttered
a
cry
of
surprise
,
and
for
a
few
moments
they
*NL*
were
so
still
that
the
listener
could
distinctly
hear
them
breathe
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
think
I
do
,
'
said
the
gentleman
,
breaking
silence
.
'
I
should
by
*NL*
your
description
.
We
shall
see
.
Many
people
are
singularly
like
each
*NL*
other
.
It
may
not
be
the
same
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
expressed
himself
to
this
effect
,
with
assumed
carelessness
,
he
*NL*
took
a
step
or
two
nearer
the
concealed
spy
,
as
the
latter
could
tell
*NL*
from
the
distinctness
with
which
he
heard
him
mutter
,
`
It
must
be
he
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Now
,
'
he
said
,
returning
:
so
it
seemed
by
the
sound
:
to
the
spot
*NL*
where
he
had
stood
before
,
`
you
have
given
us
most
valuable
assistance
,
*NL*
young
woman
,
and
I
wish
you
to
be
the
better
for
it
.
What
can
I
do
to
*NL*
serve
you
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Nothing
,
'
replied
Nancy
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
will
not
persist
in
saying
that
,
'
rejoined
the
gentleman
,
with
a
*NL*
voice
and
emphasis
of
kindness
that
might
have
touched
a
much
harder
*NL*
and
more
obdurate
heart
.
`
Think
now
.
Tell
me
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Nothing
,
sir
,
'
rejoined
the
girl
,
weeping
.
`
You
can
do
nothing
to
*NL*
help
me
.
I
am
past
all
hope
,
indeed
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
put
yourself
beyond
its
pale
,
'
said
the
gentleman
.
`
The
past
has
*NL*
been
a
dreary
waste
with
you
,
of
youthful
energies
mis-spent
,
and
such
*NL*
priceless
treasures
lavished
,
as
the
Creator
bestows
but
once
and
never
*NL*
grants
again
,
but
,
for
the
future
,
you
may
hope
.
I
do
not
say
that
it
*NL*
is
in
our
power
to
offer
you
peace
of
heart
and
mind
,
for
that
must
*NL*
come
as
you
seek
it
;
but
a
quiet
asylum
,
either
in
England
,
or
,
if
you
*NL*
fear
to
remain
here
,
in
some
foreign
country
,
it
is
not
only
within
the
*NL*
compass
of
our
ability
but
our
most
anxious
wish
to
secure
you
.
Before
*NL*
the
dawn
of
morning
,
before
this
river
wakes
to
the
first
glimpse
of
*NL*
day-light
,
you
shall
be
placed
as
entirely
beyond
the
reach
of
your
*NL*
former
associates
,
and
leave
as
utter
an
absence
of
all
trace
behind
*NL*
you
,
as
if
you
were
to
disappear
from
the
earth
this
moment
.
Come
!
I
*NL*
would
not
have
you
go
back
to
exchange
one
word
with
any
old
companion
,
*NL*
or
take
one
look
at
any
old
haunt
,
or
breathe
the
very
air
which
is
*NL*
pestilence
and
death
to
you
.
Quit
them
all
,
while
there
is
time
and
*NL*
opportunity
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
She
will
be
persuaded
now
,
'
cried
the
young
lady
.
`
She
hesitates
,
I
*NL*
am
sure
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
fear
not
,
my
dear
,
'
said
the
gentleman
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
sir
,
I
do
not
,
'
replied
the
girl
,
after
a
short
struggle
.
'
I
am
*NL*
chained
to
my
old
life
.
I
loathe
and
hate
it
now
,
but
I
can
not
leave
*NL*
it
.
I
must
have
gone
too
far
to
turn
back
,
--
and
yet
I
do
n't
know
,
for
*NL*
if
you
had
spoken
to
me
so
,
some
time
ago
,
I
should
have
laughed
it
*NL*
off
.
But
,
'
she
said
,
looking
hastily
round
,
`
this
fear
comes
over
me
*NL*
again
.
I
must
go
home
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Home
!
'
repeated
the
young
lady
,
with
great
stress
upon
the
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Home
,
lady
,
'
rejoined
the
girl
.
`
To
such
a
home
as
I
have
raised
for
*NL*
myself
with
the
work
of
my
whole
life
.
Let
us
part
.
I
shall
be
watched
*NL*
or
seen
.
Go
!
Go
!
If
I
have
done
you
any
service
all
I
ask
is
,
that
*NL*
you
leave
me
,
and
let
me
go
my
way
alone
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
is
useless
,
'
said
the
gentleman
,
with
a
sigh
.
`
We
compromise
her
*NL*
safety
,
perhaps
,
by
staying
here
.
We
may
have
detained
her
longer
than
*NL*
she
expected
already
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
yes
,
'
urged
the
girl
.
`
You
have
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
,
'
cried
the
young
lady
,
`
can
be
the
end
of
this
poor
creature
's
*NL*
life
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
!
'
repeated
the
girl
.
`
Look
before
you
,
lady
.
Look
at
that
dark
*NL*
water
.
How
many
times
do
you
read
of
such
as
I
who
spring
into
the
*NL*
tide
,
and
leave
no
living
thing
,
to
care
for
,
or
bewail
them
.
It
may
*NL*
be
years
hence
,
or
it
may
be
only
months
,
but
I
shall
come
to
that
at
*NL*
last
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Do
not
speak
thus
,
pray
,
'
returned
the
young
lady
,
sobbing
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
will
never
reach
your
ears
,
dear
lady
,
and
God
forbid
such
horrors
*NL*
should
!
'
replied
the
girl
.
`
Good-night
,
good-night
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
gentleman
turned
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
This
purse
,
'
cried
the
young
lady
.
`
Take
it
for
my
sake
,
that
you
may
*NL*
have
some
resource
in
an
hour
of
need
and
trouble
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
!
'
replied
the
girl
.
'
I
have
not
done
this
for
money
.
Let
me
have
*NL*
that
to
think
of
.
And
yet
--
give
me
something
that
you
have
worn
:
I
*NL*
should
like
to
have
something
--
no
,
no
,
not
a
ring
--
your
gloves
or
*NL*
handkerchief
--
anything
that
I
can
keep
,
as
having
belonged
to
you
,
*NL*
sweet
lady
.
There
.
Bless
you
!
God
bless
you

Good-night
,
good-night
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
violent
agitation
of
the
girl
,
and
the
apprehension
of
some
*NL*
discovery
which
would
subject
her
to
ill-usage
and
violence
,
seemed
to
*NL*
determine
the
gentleman
to
leave
her
,
as
she
requested
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sound
of
retreating
footsteps
were
audible
and
the
voices
ceased
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
figures
of
the
young
lady
and
her
companion
soon
afterwards
*NL*
appeared
upon
the
bridge
.
They
stopped
at
the
summit
of
the
stairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Hark
!
'
cried
the
young
lady
,
listening
.
`
Did
she
call
!
I
thought
I
*NL*
heard
her
voice
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
my
love
,
'
replied
Mr.
Brownlow
,
looking
sadly
back
.
`
She
has
not
*NL*
moved
,
and
will
not
till
we
are
gone
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Rose
Maylie
lingered
,
but
the
old
gentleman
drew
her
arm
through
his
,
*NL*
and
led
her
,
with
gentle
force
,
away
.
As
they
disappeared
,
the
girl
*NL*
sunk
down
nearly
at
her
full
length
upon
one
of
the
stone
stairs
,
and
*NL*
vented
the
anguish
of
her
heart
in
bitter
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
time
she
arose
,
and
with
feeble
and
tottering
steps
ascended
*NL*
the
street
.
The
astonished
listener
remained
motionless
on
his
post
*NL*
for
some
minutes
afterwards
,
and
having
ascertained
,
with
many
cautious
*NL*
glances
round
him
,
that
he
was
again
alone
,
crept
slowly
from
his
*NL*
hiding-place
,
and
returned
,
stealthily
and
in
the
shade
of
the
wall
,
in
*NL*
the
same
manner
as
he
had
descended
.
*NL*
*NL*
Peeping
out
,
more
than
once
,
when
he
reached
the
top
,
to
make
sure
that
*NL*
he
was
unobserved
,
Noah
Claypole
darted
away
at
his
utmost
speed
,
and
*NL*
made
for
the
Jew
's
house
as
fast
as
his
legs
would
carry
him

CHAPTER
XLVII
*NL*
*NL*
FATAL
CONSEQUENCES
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
nearly
two
hours
before
day-break
;
that
time
which
in
the
autumn
*NL*
of
the
year
,
may
be
truly
called
the
dead
of
night
;
when
the
streets
*NL*
are
silent
and
deserted
;
when
even
sounds
appear
to
slumber
,
and
*NL*
profligacy
and
riot
have
staggered
home
to
dream
;
it
was
at
this
still
*NL*
and
silent
hour
,
that
Fagin
sat
watching
in
his
old
lair
,
with
face
so
*NL*
distorted
and
pale
,
and
eyes
so
red
and
blood-shot
,
that
he
looked
less
*NL*
like
a
man
,
than
like
some
hideous
phantom
,
moist
from
the
grave
,
and
*NL*
worried
by
an
evil
spirit
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
sat
crouching
over
a
cold
hearth
,
wrapped
in
an
old
torn
coverlet
,
*NL*
with
his
face
turned
towards
a
wasting
candle
that
stood
upon
a
table
*NL*
by
his
side
.
His
right
hand
was
raised
to
his
lips
,
and
as
,
absorbed
*NL*
in
thought
,
he
hit
his
long
black
nails
,
he
disclosed
among
his
*NL*
toothless
gums
a
few
such
fangs
as
should
have
been
a
dog
's
or
rat
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stretched
upon
a
mattress
on
the
floor
,
lay
Noah
Claypole
,
fast
asleep
.
*NL*
Towards
him
the
old
man
sometimes
directed
his
eyes
for
an
instant
,
and
*NL*
then
brought
them
back
again
to
the
candle
;
which
with
a
long-burnt
*NL*
wick
drooping
almost
double
,
and
hot
grease
falling
down
in
clots
upon
*NL*
the
table
,
plainly
showed
that
his
thoughts
were
busy
elsewhere
.
*NL*
*NL*
Indeed
they
were
.
Mortification
at
the
overthrow
of
his
notable
*NL*
scheme
;
hatred
of
the
girl
who
had
dared
to
palter
with
strangers
;
and
*NL*
utter
distrust
of
the
sincerity
of
her
refusal
to
yield
him
up
;
bitter
*NL*
disappointment
at
the
loss
of
his
revenge
on
Sikes
;
the
fear
of
*NL*
detection
,
and
ruin
,
and
death
;
and
a
fierce
and
deadly
rage
kindled
by
*NL*
all
;
these
were
the
passionate
considerations
which
,
following
close
*NL*
upon
each
other
with
rapid
and
ceaseless
whirl
,
shot
through
the
brain
*NL*
of
Fagin
,
as
every
evil
thought
and
blackest
purpose
lay
working
at
his
*NL*
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
sat
without
changing
his
attitude
in
the
least
,
or
appearing
to
take
*NL*
the
smallest
heed
of
time
,
until
his
quick
ear
seemed
to
be
attracted
*NL*
by
a
footstep
in
the
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
At
last
,
'
he
muttered
,
wiping
his
dry
and
fevered
mouth
.
`
At
last
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
bell
rang
gently
as
he
spoke
.
He
crept
upstairs
to
the
door
,
and
*NL*
presently
returned
accompanied
by
a
man
muffled
to
the
chin
,
who
*NL*
carried
a
bundle
under
one
arm
.
Sitting
down
and
throwing
back
his
*NL*
outer
coat
,
the
man
displayed
the
burly
frame
of
Sikes
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
There
!
'
he
said
,
laying
the
bundle
on
the
table
.
`
Take
care
of
that
,
*NL*
and
do
the
most
you
can
with
it
.
It
's
been
trouble
enough
to
get
;
I
*NL*
thought
I
should
have
been
here
,
three
hours
ago
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Fagin
laid
his
hand
upon
the
bundle
,
and
locking
it
in
the
cupboard
,
*NL*
sat
down
again
without
speaking
.
But
he
did
not
take
his
eyes
off
the
*NL*
robber
,
for
an
instant
,
during
this
action
;
and
now
that
they
sat
over
*NL*
against
each
other
,
face
to
face
,
he
looked
fixedly
at
him
,
with
his
*NL*
lips
quivering
so
violently
,
and
his
face
so
altered
by
the
emotions
*NL*
which
had
mastered
him
,
that
the
housebreaker
involuntarily
drew
back
*NL*
his
chair
,
and
surveyed
him
with
a
look
of
real
affright
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Wot
now
?
'
cried
Sikes
.
`
Wot
do
you
look
at
a
man
so
for
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
Fagin
raised
his
right
hand
,
and
shook
his
trembling
forefinger
in
the
*NL*
air
;
but
his
passion
was
so
great
,
that
the
power
of
speech
was
for
the
*NL*
moment
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Damme
!
'
said
Sikes
,
feeling
in
his
breast
with
a
look
of
alarm
.
`
He
's
*NL*
gone
mad
.
I
must
look
to
myself
here
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
no
,
'
rejoined
Fagin
,
finding
his
voice
.
`
It
's
not
--
you
're
not
the
*NL*
person
,
Bill
.
I
've
no
--
no
fault
to
find
with
you
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
,
you
have
n't
,
have
n't
you
?
'
said
Sikes
,
looking
sternly
at
him
,
and
*NL*
ostentatiously
passing
a
pistol
into
a
more
convenient
pocket
.
`
That
's
*NL*
lucky
--
for
one
of
us
.
Which
one
that
is
,
do
n't
matter
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
've
got
that
to
tell
you
,
Bill
,
'
said
Fagin
,
drawing
his
chair
*NL*
nearer
,
`
will
make
you
worse
than
me
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Aye
?
'
returned
the
robber
with
an
incredulous
air
.
`
Tell
away
!
Look
*NL*
sharp
,
or
Nance
will
think
I
'm
lost
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Lost
!
'
cried
Fagin
.
`
She
has
pretty
well
settled
that
,
in
her
own
*NL*
mind
,
already
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Sikes
looked
with
an
aspect
of
great
perplexity
into
the
Jew
's
face
,
*NL*
and
reading
no
satisfactory
explanation
of
the
riddle
there
,
clenched
*NL*
his
coat
collar
in
his
huge
hand
and
shook
him
soundly
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Speak
,
will
you
!
'
he
said
;
`
or
if
you
do
n't
,
it
shall
be
for
want
of
*NL*
breath
.
Open
your
mouth
and
say
wot
you
've
got
to
say
in
plain
words
.
*NL*
Out
with
it
,
you
thundering
old
cur
,
out
with
it
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Suppose
that
lad
that
's
laying
there
--
'
Fagin
began
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sikes
turned
round
to
where
Noah
was
sleeping
,
as
if
he
had
not
*NL*
previously
observed
him
.
`
Well
!
'
he
said
,
resuming
his
former
position
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Suppose
that
lad
,
'
pursued
Fagin
,
`
was
to
peach
--
to
blow
upon
us
*NL*
all
--
first
seeking
out
the
right
folks
for
the
purpose
,
and
then
having
*NL*
a
meeting
with
'em
in
the
street
to
paint
our
likenesses
,
describe
*NL*
every
mark
that
they
might
know
us
by
,
and
the
crib
where
we
might
be
*NL*
most
easily
taken
.
Suppose
he
was
to
do
all
this
,
and
besides
to
blow
*NL*
upon
a
plant
we
've
all
been
in
,
more
or
less
--
of
his
own
fancy
;
not
*NL*
grabbed
,
trapped
,
tried
,
earwigged
by
the
parson
and
brought
to
it
on
*NL*
bread
and
water
,
--
but
of
his
own
fancy
;
to
please
his
own
taste
;
*NL*
stealing
out
at
nights
to
find
those
most
interested
against
us
,
and
*NL*
peaching
to
them
.
Do
you
hear
me
?
'
cried
the
Jew
,
his
eyes
flashing
*NL*
with
rage
.
`
Suppose
he
did
all
this
,
what
then
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
then
!
'
replied
Sikes
;
with
a
tremendous
oath
.
`
If
he
was
left
*NL*
alive
till
I
came
,
I
'd
grind
his
skull
under
the
iron
heel
of
my
boot
*NL*
into
as
many
grains
as
there
are
hairs
upon
his
head
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
if
I
did
it
!
'
cried
Fagin
almost
in
a
yell
.
`
I
,
that
knows
so
*NL*
much
,
and
could
hang
so
many
besides
myself
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
do
n't
know
,
'
replied
Sikes
,
clenching
his
teeth
and
turning
white
at
*NL*
the
mere
suggestion
.
`
I
'd
do
something
in
the
jail
that
`
ud
get
me
put
*NL*
in
irons
;
and
if
I
was
tried
along
with
you
,
I
'd
fall
upon
you
with
*NL*
them
in
the
open
court
,
and
beat
your
brains
out
afore
the
people
.
I
*NL*
should
have
such
strength
,
'
muttered
the
robber
,
poising
his
brawny
*NL*
arm
,
`
that
I
could
smash
your
head
as
if
a
loaded
waggon
had
gone
over
*NL*
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
would
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Would
I
!
'
said
the
housebreaker
.
`
Try
me
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
If
it
was
Charley
,
or
the
Dodger
,
or
Bet
,
or
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
do
n't
care
who
,
'
replied
Sikes
impatiently
.
`
Whoever
it
was
,
I
'd
*NL*
serve
them
the
same
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Fagin
looked
hard
at
the
robber
;
and
,
motioning
him
to
be
silent
,
*NL*
stooped
over
the
bed
upon
the
floor
,
and
shook
the
sleeper
to
rouse
*NL*
him
.
Sikes
leant
forward
in
his
chair
:
looking
on
with
his
hands
upon
*NL*
his
knees
,
as
if
wondering
much
what
all
this
questioning
and
*NL*
preparation
was
to
end
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Bolter
,
Bolter
!
Poor
lad
!
'
said
Fagin
,
looking
up
with
an
expression
*NL*
of
devilish
anticipation
,
and
speaking
slowly
and
with
marked
emphasis
.
*NL*
`
He
's
tired
--
tired
with
watching
for
her
so
long
,
--
watching
for
_
her
_
,
*NL*
Bill
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Wot
d'ye
mean
?
'
asked
Sikes
,
drawing
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fagin
made
no
answer
,
but
bending
over
the
sleeper
again
,
hauled
him
*NL*
into
a
sitting
posture
.
When
his
assumed
name
had
been
repeated
*NL*
several
times
,
Noah
rubbed
his
eyes
,
and
,
giving
a
heavy
yawn
,
looked
*NL*
sleepily
about
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Tell
me
that
again
--
once
again
,
just
for
him
to
hear
,
'
said
the
Jew
,
*NL*
pointing
to
Sikes
as
he
spoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Tell
yer
what
?
'
asked
the
sleepy
Noah
,
shaking
himself
pettishly
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
about
--
_
Nancy
_
,
'
said
Fagin
,
clutching
Sikes
by
the
wrist
,
as
if
*NL*
to
prevent
his
leaving
the
house
before
he
had
heard
enough
.
`
You
*NL*
followed
her
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
To
London
Bridge
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Where
she
met
two
people
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
So
she
did
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
A
gentleman
and
a
lady
that
she
had
gone
to
of
her
own
accord
before
,
*NL*
who
asked
her
to
give
up
all
her
pals
,
and
Monks
first
,
which
she
*NL*
did
--
and
to
describe
him
,
which
she
did
--
and
to
tell
her
what
house
it
*NL*
was
that
we
meet
at
,
and
go
to
,
which
she
did
--
and
where
it
could
be
*NL*
best
watched
from
,
which
she
did
--
and
what
time
the
people
went
there
,
*NL*
which
she
did
.
She
did
all
this
.
She
told
it
all
every
word
without
a
*NL*
threat
,
without
a
murmur
--
she
did
--
did
she
not
?
'
cried
Fagin
,
half
mad
*NL*
with
fury
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
All
right
,
'
replied
Noah
,
scratching
his
head
.
`
That
's
just
what
it
*NL*
was
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
did
they
say
,
about
last
Sunday
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
About
last
Sunday
!
'
replied
Noah
,
considering
.
`
Why
I
told
yer
that
*NL*
before
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Again
.
Tell
it
again
!
'
cried
Fagin
,
tightening
his
grasp
on
Sikes
,
*NL*
and
brandishing
his
other
hand
aloft
,
as
the
foam
flew
from
his
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
They
asked
her
,
'
said
Noah
,
who
,
as
he
grew
more
wakeful
,
seemed
to
*NL*
have
a
dawning
perception
who
Sikes
was
,
`
they
asked
her
why
she
did
n't
*NL*
come
,
last
Sunday
,
as
she
promised
.
She
said
she
could
n't
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
--
why
?
Tell
him
that
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Because
she
was
forcibly
kept
at
home
by
Bill
,
the
man
she
had
told
*NL*
them
of
before
,
'
replied
Noah
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
more
of
him
?
'
cried
Fagin
.
`
What
more
of
the
man
she
had
told
*NL*
them
of
before
?
Tell
him
that
,
tell
him
that
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
that
she
could
n't
very
easily
get
out
of
doors
unless
he
knew
*NL*
where
she
was
going
to
,
'
said
Noah
;
`
and
so
the
first
time
she
went
to
*NL*
see
the
lady
,
she
--
ha
!
ha
!
ha
!
it
made
me
laugh
when
she
said
it
,
that
*NL*
it
did
--
she
gave
him
a
drink
of
laudanum
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Hell
's
fire
!
'
cried
Sikes
,
breaking
fiercely
from
the
Jew
.
`
Let
me
*NL*
go
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Flinging
the
old
man
from
him
,
he
rushed
from
the
room
,
and
darted
,
*NL*
wildly
and
furiously
,
up
the
stairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Bill
,
Bill
!
'
cried
Fagin
,
following
him
hastily
.
'
A
word
.
Only
a
*NL*
word
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
word
would
not
have
been
exchanged
,
but
that
the
housebreaker
was
*NL*
unable
to
open
the
door
:
on
which
he
was
expending
fruitless
oaths
and
*NL*
violence
,
when
the
Jew
came
panting
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Let
me
out
,
'
said
Sikes
.
`
Do
n't
speak
to
me
;
it
's
not
safe
.
Let
me
*NL*
out
,
I
say
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Hear
me
speak
a
word
,
'
rejoined
Fagin
,
laying
his
hand
upon
the
lock
.
*NL*
`
You
wo
n't
be
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
'
replied
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
wo
n't
be
--
too
--
violent
,
Bill
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
day
was
breaking
,
and
there
was
light
enough
for
the
men
to
see
*NL*
each
other
's
faces
.
They
exchanged
one
brief
glance
;
there
was
a
fire
*NL*
in
the
eyes
of
both
,
which
could
not
be
mistaken
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
mean
,
'
said
Fagin
,
showing
that
he
felt
all
disguise
was
now
*NL*
useless
,
`
not
too
violent
for
safety
.
Be
crafty
,
Bill
,
and
not
too
*NL*
bold
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Sikes
made
no
reply
;
but
,
pulling
open
the
door
,
of
which
Fagin
had
*NL*
turned
the
lock
,
dashed
into
the
silent
streets
.
*NL*
*NL*
Without
one
pause
,
or
moment
's
consideration
;
without
once
turning
his
*NL*
head
to
the
right
or
left
,
or
raising
his
eyes
to
the
sky
,
or
lowering
*NL*
them
to
the
ground
,
but
looking
straight
before
him
with
savage
*NL*
resolution
:
his
teeth
so
tightly
compressed
that
the
strained
jaw
*NL*
seemed
starting
through
his
skin
;
the
robber
held
on
his
headlong
*NL*
course
,
nor
muttered
a
word
,
nor
relaxed
a
muscle
,
until
he
reached
his
*NL*
own
door
.
He
opened
it
,
softly
,
with
a
key
;
strode
lightly
up
the
*NL*
stairs
;
and
entering
his
own
room
,
double-locked
the
door
,
and
lifting
*NL*
a
heavy
table
against
it
,
drew
back
the
curtain
of
the
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
girl
was
lying
,
half-dressed
,
upon
it
.
He
had
roused
her
from
her
*NL*
sleep
,
for
she
raised
herself
with
a
hurried
and
startled
look
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Get
up
!
'
said
the
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
is
you
,
Bill
!
'
said
the
girl
,
with
an
expression
of
pleasure
at
his
*NL*
return
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
is
,
'
was
the
reply
.
`
Get
up
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
candle
burning
,
but
the
man
hastily
drew
it
from
the
*NL*
candlestick
,
and
hurled
it
under
the
grate
.
Seeing
the
faint
light
of
*NL*
early
day
without
,
the
girl
rose
to
undraw
the
curtain
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Let
it
be
,
'
said
Sikes
,
thrusting
his
hand
before
her
.
`
There
's
enough
*NL*
light
for
wot
I
've
got
to
do
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Bill
,
'
said
the
girl
,
in
the
low
voice
of
alarm
,
`
why
do
you
look
like
*NL*
that
at
me
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
robber
sat
regarding
her
,
for
a
few
seconds
,
with
dilated
nostrils
*NL*
and
heaving
breast
;
and
then
,
grasping
her
by
the
head
and
throat
,
*NL*
dragged
her
into
the
middle
of
the
room
,
and
looking
once
towards
the
*NL*
door
,
placed
his
heavy
hand
upon
her
mouth
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Bill
,
Bill
!
'
gasped
the
girl
,
wrestling
with
the
strength
of
mortal
*NL*
fear
,
--
`
I
--
I
wo
n't
scream
or
cry
--
not
once
--
hear
me
--
speak
to
me
--
tell
*NL*
me
what
I
have
done
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
know
,
you
she
devil
!
'
returned
the
robber
,
suppressing
his
breath
.
*NL*
`
You
were
watched
to-night
;
every
word
you
said
was
heard
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Then
spare
my
life
for
the
love
of
Heaven
,
as
I
spared
yours
,
'
*NL*
rejoined
the
girl
,
clinging
to
him
.
`
Bill
,
dear
Bill
,
you
can
not
have
*NL*
the
heart
to
kill
me
.
Oh
!
think
of
all
I
have
given
up
,
only
this
one
*NL*
night
,
for
you
.
You
_
shall
_
have
time
to
think
,
and
save
yourself
this
*NL*
crime
;
I
will
not
loose
my
hold
,
you
can
not
throw
me
off
.
Bill
,
Bill
,
*NL*
for
dear
God
's
sake
,
for
your
own
,
for
mine
,
stop
before
you
spill
my
*NL*
blood
!
I
have
been
true
to
you
,
upon
my
guilty
soul
I
have
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
struggled
violently
,
to
release
his
arms
;
but
those
of
the
girl
*NL*
were
clasped
round
his
,
and
tear
her
as
he
would
,
he
could
not
tear
*NL*
them
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Bill
,
'
cried
the
girl
,
striving
to
lay
her
head
upon
his
breast
,
`
the
*NL*
gentleman
and
that
dear
lady
,
told
me
to-night
of
a
home
in
some
*NL*
foreign
country
where
I
could
end
my
days
in
solitude
and
peace
.
Let
*NL*
me
see
them
again
,
and
beg
them
,
on
my
knees
,
to
show
the
same
mercy
*NL*
and
goodness
to
you
;
and
let
us
both
leave
this
dreadful
place
,
and
far
*NL*
apart
lead
better
lives
,
and
forget
how
we
have
lived
,
except
in
*NL*
prayers
,
and
never
see
each
other
more
.
It
is
never
too
late
to
repent
.
*NL*
They
told
me
so
--
I
feel
it
now
--
but
we
must
have
time
--
a
little
,
little
*NL*
time
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
housebreaker
freed
one
arm
,
and
grasped
his
pistol
.
The
certainty
*NL*
of
immediate
detection
if
he
fired
,
flashed
across
his
mind
even
in
the
*NL*
midst
of
his
fury
;
and
he
beat
it
twice
with
all
the
force
he
could
*NL*
summon
,
upon
the
upturned
face
that
almost
touched
his
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
staggered
and
fell
:
nearly
blinded
with
the
blood
that
rained
down
*NL*
from
a
deep
gash
in
her
forehead
;
but
raising
herself
,
with
difficulty
,
*NL*
on
her
knees
,
drew
from
her
bosom
a
white
handkerchief
--
Rose
Maylie
's
*NL*
own
--
and
holding
it
up
,
in
her
folded
hands
,
as
high
towards
Heaven
as
*NL*
her
feeble
strength
would
allow
,
breathed
one
prayer
for
mercy
to
her
*NL*
Maker
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
ghastly
figure
to
look
upon
.
The
murderer
staggering
backward
*NL*
to
the
wall
,
and
shutting
out
the
sight
with
his
hand
,
seized
a
heavy
*NL*
club
and
struck
her
down
.

CHAPTER
XLVIII
*NL*
*NL*
THE
FLIGHT
OF
SIKES
*NL*
*NL*
Of
all
bad
deeds
that
,
under
cover
of
the
darkness
,
had
been
committed
*NL*
within
wide
London
's
bounds
since
night
hung
over
it
,
that
was
the
*NL*
worst
.
Of
all
the
horrors
that
rose
with
an
ill
scent
upon
the
morning
*NL*
air
,
that
was
the
foulest
and
most
cruel
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sun
--
the
bright
sun
,
that
brings
back
,
not
light
alone
,
but
new
*NL*
life
,
and
hope
,
and
freshness
to
man
--
burst
upon
the
crowded
city
in
*NL*
clear
and
radiant
glory
.
Through
costly-coloured
glass
and
*NL*
paper-mended
window
,
through
cathedral
dome
and
rotten
crevice
,
it
shed
*NL*
its
equal
ray
.
It
lighted
up
the
room
where
the
murdered
woman
lay
.
*NL*
It
did
.
He
tried
to
shut
it
out
,
but
it
would
stream
in
.
If
the
sight
*NL*
had
been
a
ghastly
one
in
the
dull
morning
,
what
was
it
,
now
,
in
all
*NL*
that
brilliant
light
!
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
not
moved
;
he
had
been
afraid
to
stir
.
There
had
been
a
moan
*NL*
and
motion
of
the
hand
;
and
,
with
terror
added
to
rage
,
he
had
struck
*NL*
and
struck
again
.
Once
he
threw
a
rug
over
it
;
but
it
was
worse
to
*NL*
fancy
the
eyes
,
and
imagine
them
moving
towards
him
,
than
to
see
them
*NL*
glaring
upward
,
as
if
watching
the
reflection
of
the
pool
of
gore
that
*NL*
quivered
and
danced
in
the
sunlight
on
the
ceiling
.
He
had
plucked
it
*NL*
off
again
.
And
there
was
the
body
--
mere
flesh
and
blood
,
no
more
--
but
*NL*
such
flesh
,
and
so
much
blood
!
*NL*
*NL*
He
struck
a
light
,
kindled
a
fire
,
and
thrust
the
club
into
it
.
There
*NL*
was
hair
upon
the
end
,
which
blazed
and
shrunk
into
a
light
cinder
,
*NL*
and
,
caught
by
the
air
,
whirled
up
the
chimney
.
Even
that
frightened
*NL*
him
,
sturdy
as
he
was
;
but
he
held
the
weapon
till
it
broke
,
and
then
*NL*
piled
it
on
the
coals
to
burn
away
,
and
smoulder
into
ashes
.
He
washed
*NL*
himself
,
and
rubbed
his
clothes
;
there
were
spots
that
would
not
be
*NL*
removed
,
but
he
cut
the
pieces
out
,
and
burnt
them
.
How
those
stains
*NL*
were
dispersed
about
the
room
!
The
very
feet
of
the
dog
were
bloody
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
time
he
had
,
never
once
,
turned
his
back
upon
the
corpse
;
no
,
*NL*
not
for
a
moment
.
Such
preparations
completed
,
he
moved
,
backward
,
*NL*
towards
the
door
:
dragging
the
dog
with
him
,
lest
he
should
soil
his
*NL*
feet
anew
and
carry
out
new
evidence
of
the
crime
into
the
streets
.
He
*NL*
shut
the
door
softly
,
locked
it
,
took
the
key
,
and
left
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
crossed
over
,
and
glanced
up
at
the
window
,
to
be
sure
that
nothing
*NL*
was
visible
from
the
outside
.
There
was
the
curtain
still
drawn
,
which
*NL*
she
would
have
opened
to
admit
the
light
she
never
saw
again
.
It
lay
*NL*
nearly
under
there
.
_
He
_
knew
that
.
God
,
how
the
sun
poured
down
upon
*NL*
the
very
spot
!
*NL*
*NL*
The
glance
was
instantaneous
.
It
was
a
relief
to
have
got
free
of
the
*NL*
room
.
He
whistled
on
the
dog
,
and
walked
rapidly
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
through
Islington
;
strode
up
the
hill
at
Highgate
on
which
*NL*
stands
the
stone
in
honour
of
Whittington
;
turned
down
to
Highgate
*NL*
Hill
,
unsteady
of
purpose
,
and
uncertain
where
to
go
;
struck
off
to
the
*NL*
right
again
,
almost
as
soon
as
he
began
to
descend
it
;
and
taking
the
*NL*
foot-path
across
the
fields
,
skirted
Caen
Wood
,
and
so
came
on
*NL*
Hampstead
Heath
.
Traversing
the
hollow
by
the
Vale
of
Heath
,
he
*NL*
mounted
the
opposite
bank
,
and
crossing
the
road
which
joins
the
*NL*
villages
of
Hampstead
and
Highgate
,
made
along
the
remaining
portion
of
*NL*
the
heath
to
the
fields
at
North
End
,
in
one
of
which
he
laid
himself
*NL*
down
under
a
hedge
,
and
slept
.
*NL*
*NL*
Soon
he
was
up
again
,
and
away
,
--
not
far
into
the
country
,
but
back
*NL*
towards
London
by
the
high-road
--
then
back
again
--
then
over
another
*NL*
part
of
the
same
ground
as
he
already
traversed
--
then
wandering
up
and
*NL*
down
in
fields
,
and
lying
on
ditches
'
brinks
to
rest
,
and
starting
up
*NL*
to
make
for
some
other
spot
,
and
do
the
same
,
and
ramble
on
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Where
could
he
go
,
that
was
near
and
not
too
public
,
to
get
some
meat
*NL*
and
drink
?
Hendon
.
That
was
a
good
place
,
not
far
off
,
and
out
of
*NL*
most
people
's
way
.
Thither
he
directed
his
steps
,
--
running
sometimes
,
*NL*
and
sometimes
,
with
a
strange
perversity
,
loitering
at
a
snail
's
pace
,
*NL*
or
stopping
altogether
and
idly
breaking
the
hedges
with
a
stick
.
But
*NL*
when
he
got
there
,
all
the
people
he
met
--
the
very
children
at
the
*NL*
doors
--
seemed
to
view
him
with
suspicion
.
Back
he
turned
again
,
*NL*
without
the
courage
to
purchase
bit
or
drop
,
though
he
had
tasted
no
*NL*
food
for
many
hours
;
and
once
more
he
lingered
on
the
Heath
,
uncertain
*NL*
where
to
go
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
wandered
over
miles
and
miles
of
ground
,
and
still
came
back
to
the
*NL*
old
place
.
Morning
and
noon
had
passed
,
and
the
day
was
on
the
wane
,
*NL*
and
still
he
rambled
to
and
fro
,
and
up
and
down
,
and
round
and
round
,
*NL*
and
still
lingered
about
the
same
spot
.
At
last
he
got
away
,
and
*NL*
shaped
his
course
for
Hatfield
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
nine
o'clock
at
night
,
when
the
man
,
quite
tired
out
,
and
the
*NL*
dog
,
limping
and
lame
from
the
unaccustomed
exercise
,
turned
down
the
*NL*
hill
by
the
church
of
the
quiet
village
,
and
plodding
along
the
little
*NL*
street
,
crept
into
a
small
public-house
,
whose
scanty
light
had
guided
*NL*
them
to
the
spot
.
There
was
a
fire
in
the
tap-room
,
and
some
*NL*
country-labourers
were
drinking
before
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
made
room
for
the
stranger
,
but
he
sat
down
in
the
furthest
*NL*
corner
,
and
ate
and
drank
alone
,
or
rather
with
his
dog
:
to
whom
he
*NL*
cast
a
morsel
of
food
from
time
to
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
conversation
of
the
men
assembled
here
,
turned
upon
the
*NL*
neighbouring
land
,
and
farmers
;
and
when
those
topics
were
exhausted
,
*NL*
upon
the
age
of
some
old
man
who
had
been
buried
on
the
previous
*NL*
Sunday
;
the
young
men
present
considering
him
very
old
,
and
the
old
men
*NL*
present
declaring
him
to
have
been
quite
young
--
not
older
,
one
*NL*
white-haired
grandfather
said
,
than
he
was
--
with
ten
or
fifteen
year
of
*NL*
life
in
him
at
least
--
if
he
had
taken
care
;
if
he
had
taken
care
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
nothing
to
attract
attention
,
or
excite
alarm
in
this
.
The
*NL*
robber
,
after
paying
his
reckoning
,
sat
silent
and
unnoticed
in
his
*NL*
corner
,
and
had
almost
dropped
asleep
,
when
he
was
half
wakened
by
the
*NL*
noisy
entrance
of
a
new
comer
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
an
antic
fellow
,
half
pedlar
and
half
mountebank
,
who
*NL*
travelled
about
the
country
on
foot
to
vend
hones
,
strops
,
razors
,
*NL*
washballs
,
harness-paste
,
medicine
for
dogs
and
horses
,
cheap
*NL*
perfumery
,
cosmetics
,
and
such-like
wares
,
which
he
carried
in
a
case
*NL*
slung
to
his
back
.
His
entrance
was
the
signal
for
various
homely
*NL*
jokes
with
the
countrymen
,
which
slackened
not
until
he
had
made
his
*NL*
supper
,
and
opened
his
box
of
treasures
,
when
he
ingeniously
contrived
*NL*
to
unite
business
with
amusement
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
what
be
that
stoof
?
Good
to
eat
,
Harry
?
'
asked
a
grinning
*NL*
countryman
,
pointing
to
some
composition-cakes
in
one
corner
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
This
,
'
said

to
bolt
one

,
and
he

put
it
beyond

for

it
's
quite

satisfactory
as

There

no
wider

thicker
than

*NL*
The
man
got
no
further
,
for
Sikes
with
a
hideous
imprecation
overthrew
*NL*
the
table
,
and
tearing
the
hat
from
him
,
burst
out
of
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
the
same
perversity
of
feeling
and
irresolution
that
had
fastened
*NL*
upon
him
,
despite
himself
,
all
day
,
the
murderer
,
finding
that
he
was
*NL*
not
followed
,
and
that
they
most
probably
considered
him
some
drunken
*NL*
sullen
fellow
,
turned
back
up
the
town
,
and
getting
out
of
the
glare
of
*NL*
the
lamps
of
a
stage-coach
that
was
standing
in
the
street
,
was
walking
*NL*
past
,
when
he
recognised
the
mail
from
London
,
and
saw
that
it
was
*NL*
standing
at
the
little
post-office
.
He
almost
knew
what
was
to
come
;
*NL*
but
he
crossed
over
,
and
listened
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
guard
was
standing
at
the
door
,
waiting
for
the
letter-bag
.
A
man
,
*NL*
dressed
like
a
game-keeper
,
came
up
at
the
moment
,
and
he
handed
him
a
*NL*
basket
which
lay
ready
on
the
pavement
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
's
for
your
people
,
'
said
the
guard
.
`
Now
,
look
alive
in
there
,
*NL*
will
you
.
Damn
that
`
ere
bag
,
it
war
n't
ready
night
afore
last
;
this
*NL*
wo
n't
do
,
you
know
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Anything
new
up
in
town
,
Ben
?
'
asked
the
game-keeper
,
drawing
back
to
*NL*
the
window-shutters
,
the
better
to
admire
the
horses
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
nothing
that
I
knows
on
,
'
replied
the
man
,
pulling
on
his
gloves
.
*NL*
`
Corn
's
up
a
little
.
I
heerd
talk
of
a
murder
,
too
,
down
Spitalfields
*NL*
way
,
but
I
do
n't
reckon
much
upon
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
,
that
's
quite
true
,
'
said
a
gentleman
inside
,
who
was
looking
out
*NL*
of
the
window
.
`
And
a
dreadful
murder
it
was
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Was
it
,
sir
?
'
rejoined
the
guard
,
touching
his
hat
.
`
Man
or
woman
,
*NL*
pray
,
sir
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
A
woman
,
'
replied
the
gentleman
.
`
It
is
supposed
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Now
,
Ben
,
'
replied
the
coachman
impatiently
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Damn
that
`
ere
bag
,
'
said
the
guard
;
`
are
you
gone
to
sleep
in
there
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Coming
!
'
cried
the
office
keeper
,
running
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Coming
,
'
growled
the
guard
.
`
Ah
,
and
so
's
the
young
`
ooman
of
*NL*
property
that
's
going
to
take
a
fancy
to
me
,
but
I
do
n't
know
when
.
*NL*
Here
,
give
hold
.
All
ri
--
ight
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
horn
sounded
a
few
cheerful
notes
,
and
the
coach
was
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sikes
remained
standing
in
the
street
,
apparently
unmoved
by
what
he
*NL*
had
just
heard
,
and
agitated
by
no
stronger
feeling
than
a
doubt
where
*NL*
to
go
.
At
length
he
went
back
again
,
and
took
the
road
which
leads
*NL*
from
Hatfield
to
St.
Albans
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
on
doggedly
;
but
as
he
left
the
town
behind
him
,
and
plunged
*NL*
into
the
solitude
and
darkness
of
the
road
,
he
felt
a
dread
and
awe
*NL*
creeping
upon
him
which
shook
him
to
the
core
.
Every
object
before
him
,
*NL*
substance
or
shadow
,
still
or
moving
,
took
the
semblance
of
some
*NL*
fearful
thing
;
but
these
fears
were
nothing
compared
to
the
sense
that
*NL*
haunted
him
of
that
morning
's
ghastly
figure
following
at
his
heels
.
*NL*
He
could
trace
its
shadow
in
the
gloom
,
supply
the
smallest
item
of
the
*NL*
outline
,
and
note
how
stiff
and
solemn
it
seemed
to
stalk
along
.
He
*NL*
could
hear
its
garments
rustling
in
the
leaves
,
and
every
breath
of
*NL*
wind
came
laden
with
that
last
low
cry
.
If
he
stopped
it
did
the
same
.
*NL*
If
he
ran
,
it
followed
--
not
running
too
:
that
would
have
been
a
*NL*
relief
:
but
like
a
corpse
endowed
with
the
mere
machinery
of
life
,
and
*NL*
borne
on
one
slow
melancholy
wind
that
never
rose
or
fell
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
times
,
he
turned
,
with
desperate
determination
,
resolved
to
beat
*NL*
this
phantom
off
,
though
it
should
look
him
dead
;
but
the
hair
rose
on
*NL*
his
head
,
and
his
blood
stood
still
,
for
it
had
turned
with
him
and
was
*NL*
behind
him
then
.
He
had
kept
it
before
him
that
morning
,
but
it
was
*NL*
behind
now
--
always
.
He
leaned
his
back
against
a
bank
,
and
felt
that
*NL*
it
stood
above
him
,
visibly
out
against
the
cold
night-sky
.
He
threw
*NL*
himself
upon
the
road
--
on
his
back
upon
the
road
.
At
his
head
it
*NL*
stood
,
silent
,
erect
,
and
still
--
a
living
grave-stone
,
with
its
epitaph
*NL*
in
blood
.
*NL*
*NL*
Let
no
man
talk
of
murderers
escaping
justice
,
and
hint
that
Providence
*NL*
must
sleep
.
There
were
twenty
score
of
violent
deaths
in
one
long
*NL*
minute
of
that
agony
of
fear
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
shed
in
a
field
he
passed
,
that
offered
shelter
for
the
*NL*
night
.
Before
the
door
,
were
three
tall
poplar
trees
,
which
made
it
*NL*
very
dark
within
;
and
the
wind
moaned
through
them
with
a
dismal
wail
.
*NL*
He
_
could
not
_
walk
on
,
till
daylight
came
again
;
and
here
he
stretched
*NL*
himself
close
to
the
wall
--
to
undergo
new
torture
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
now
,
a
vision
came
before
him
,
as
constant
and
more
terrible
than
*NL*
that
from
which
he
had
escaped
.
Those
widely
staring
eyes
,
so
*NL*
lustreless
and
so
glassy
,
that
he
had
better
borne
to
see
them
than
*NL*
think
upon
them
,
appeared
in
the
midst
of
the
darkness
:
light
in
*NL*
themselves
,
but
giving
light
to
nothing
.
There
were
but
two
,
but
they
*NL*
were
everywhere
.
If
he
shut
out
the
sight
,
there
came
the
room
with
*NL*
every
well-known
object
--
some
,
indeed
,
that
he
would
have
forgotten
,
if
*NL*
he
had
gone
over
its
contents
from
memory
--
each
in
its
accustomed
*NL*
place
.
The
body
was
in
_
its
_
place
,
and
its
eyes
were
as
he
saw
them
*NL*
when
he
stole
away
.
He
got
up
,
and
rushed
into
the
field
without
.
The
*NL*
figure
was
behind
him
.
He
re-entered
the
shed
,
and
shrunk
down
once
*NL*
more
.
The
eyes
were
there
,
before
he
had
laid
himself
along
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
here
he
remained
in
such
terror
as
none
but
he
can
know
,
trembling
*NL*
in
every
limb
,
and
the
cold
sweat
starting
from
every
pore
,
when
*NL*
suddenly
there
arose
upon
the
night-wind
the
noise
of
distant
shouting
,
*NL*
and
the
roar
of
voices
mingled
in
alarm
and
wonder
.
Any
sound
of
men
*NL*
in
that
lonely
place
,
even
though
it
conveyed
a
real
cause
of
alarm
,
*NL*
was
something
to
him
.
He
regained
his
strength
and
energy
at
the
*NL*
prospect
of
personal
danger
;
and
springing
to
his
feet
,
rushed
into
the
*NL*
open
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
broad
sky
seemed
on
fire
.
Rising
into
the
air
with
showers
of
*NL*
sparks
,
and
rolling
one
above
the
other
,
were
sheets
of
flame
,
lighting
*NL*
the
atmosphere
for
miles
round
,
and
driving
clouds
of
smoke
in
the
*NL*
direction
where
he
stood
.
The
shouts
grew
louder
as
new
voices
swelled
*NL*
the
roar
,
and
he
could
hear
the
cry
of
Fire
!
mingled
with
the
ringing
*NL*
of
an
alarm-bell
,
the
fall
of
heavy
bodies
,
and
the
crackling
of
flames
*NL*
as
they
twined
round
some
new
obstacle
,
and
shot
aloft
as
though
*NL*
refreshed
by
food
.
The
noise
increased
as
he
looked
.
There
were
*NL*
people
there
--
men
and
women
--
light
,
bustle
.
It
was
like
new
life
to
*NL*
him
.
He
darted
onward
--
straight
,
headlong
--
dashing
through
brier
and
*NL*
brake
,
and
leaping
gate
and
fence
as
madly
as
his
dog
,
who
careered
*NL*
with
loud
and
sounding
bark
before
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
came
upon
the
spot
.
There
were
half-dressed
figures
tearing
to
and
*NL*
fro
,
some
endeavouring
to
drag
the
frightened
horses
from
the
stables
,
*NL*
others
driving
the
cattle
from
the
yard
and
out-houses
,
and
others
*NL*
coming
laden
from
the
burning
pile
,
amidst
a
shower
of
falling
sparks
,
*NL*
and
the
tumbling
down
of
red-hot
beams
.
The
apertures
,
where
doors
and
*NL*
windows
stood
an
hour
ago
,
disclosed
a
mass
of
raging
fire
;
walls
*NL*
rocked
and
crumbled
into
the
burning
well
;
the
molten
lead
and
iron
*NL*
poured
down
,
white
hot
,
upon
the
ground
.
Women
and
children
shrieked
,
*NL*
and
men
encouraged
each
other
with
noisy
shouts
and
cheers
.
The
*NL*
clanking
of
the
engine-pumps
,
and
the
spirting
and
hissing
of
the
water
*NL*
as
it
fell
upon
the
blazing
wood
,
added
to
the
tremendous
roar
.
He
*NL*
shouted
,
too
,
till
he
was
hoarse
;
and
flying
from
memory
and
himself
,
*NL*
plunged
into
the
thickest
of
the
throng
.
Hither
and
thither
he
dived
*NL*
that
night
:
now
working
at
the
pumps
,
and
now
hurrying
through
the
*NL*
smoke
and
flame
,
but
never
ceasing
to
engage
himself
wherever
noise
and
*NL*
men
were
thickest
.
Up
and
down
the
ladders
,
upon
the
roofs
of
*NL*
buildings
,
over
floors
that
quaked
and
trembled
with
his
weight
,
under
*NL*
the
lee
of
falling
bricks
and
stones
,
in
every
part
of
that
great
fire
*NL*
was
he
;
but
he
bore
a
charmed
life
,
and
had
neither
scratch
nor
bruise
,
*NL*
nor
weariness
nor
thought
,
till
morning
dawned
again
,
and
only
smoke
*NL*
and
blackened
ruins
remained
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
mad
excitement
over
,
there
returned
,
with
ten-fold
force
,
the
*NL*
dreadful
consciousness
of
his
crime
.
He
looked
suspiciously
about
him
,
*NL*
for
the
men
were
conversing
in
groups
,
and
he
feared
to
be
the
subject
*NL*
of
their
talk
.
The
dog
obeyed
the
significant
beck
of
his
finger
,
and
*NL*
they
drew
off
,
stealthily
,
together
.
He
passed
near
an
engine
where
*NL*
some
men
were
seated
,
and
they
called
to
him
to
share
in
their
*NL*
refreshment
.
He
took
some
bread
and
meat
;
and
as
he
drank
a
draught
of
*NL*
beer
,
heard
the
firemen
,
who
were
from
London
,
talking
about
the
*NL*
murder
.
`
He
has
gone
to
Birmingham
,
they
say
,
'
said
one
:
`
but
they
'll
*NL*
have
him
yet
,
for
the
scouts
are
out
,
and
by
to-morrow
night
there
'll
*NL*
be
a
cry
all
through
the
country
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
hurried
off
,
and
walked
till
he
almost
dropped
upon
the
ground
;
then
*NL*
lay
down
in
a
lane
,
and
had
a
long
,
but
broken
and
uneasy
sleep
.
He
*NL*
wandered
on
again
,
irresolute
and
undecided
,
and
oppressed
with
the
*NL*
fear
of
another
solitary
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
,
he
took
the
desperate
resolution
to
going
back
to
London
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
There
's
somebody
to
speak
to
there
,
at
all
event
,
'
he
thought
.
'
A
good
*NL*
hiding-place
,
too
.
They
'll
never
expect
to
nab
me
there
,
after
this
*NL*
country
scent
.
Why
ca
n't
I
lie
by
for
a
week
or
so
,
and
,
forcing
blunt
*NL*
from
Fagin
,
get
abroad
to
France
?
Damme
,
I
'll
risk
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
acted
upon
this
impulse
without
delay
,
and
choosing
the
least
*NL*
frequented
roads
began
his
journey
back
,
resolved
to
lie
concealed
*NL*
within
a
short
distance
of
the
metropolis
,
and
,
entering
it
at
dusk
by
*NL*
a
circuitous
route
,
to
proceed
straight
to
that
part
of
it
which
he
had
*NL*
fixed
on
for
his
destination
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
dog
,
though
.
If
any
description
of
him
were
out
,
it
would
not
be
*NL*
forgotten
that
the
dog
was
missing
,
and
had
probably
gone
with
him
.
*NL*
This
might
lead
to
his
apprehension
as
he
passed
along
the
streets
.
He
*NL*
resolved
to
drown
him
,
and
walked
on
,
looking
about
for
a
pond
:
*NL*
picking
up
a
heavy
stone
and
tying
it
to
his
handkerchief
as
he
went
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
animal
looked
up
into
his
master
's
face
while
these
preparations
*NL*
were
making
;
whether
his
instinct
apprehended
something
of
their
*NL*
purpose
,
or
the
robber
's
sidelong
look
at
him
was
sterner
than
*NL*
ordinary
,
he
skulked
a
little
farther
in
the
rear
than
usual
,
and
*NL*
cowered
as
he
came
more
slowly
along
.
When
his
master
halted
at
the
*NL*
brink
of
a
pool
,
and
looked
round
to
call
him
,
he
stopped
outright
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Do
you
hear
me
call
?
Come
here
!
'
cried
Sikes
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
animal
came
up
from
the
very
force
of
habit
;
but
as
Sikes
stooped
*NL*
to
attach
the
handkerchief
to
his
throat
,
he
uttered
a
low
growl
and
*NL*
started
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Come
back
!
'
said
the
robber
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
dog
wagged
his
tail
,
but
moved
not
.
Sikes
made
a
running
noose
and
*NL*
called
him
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
dog
advanced
,
retreated
,
paused
an
instant
,
and
scoured
away
at
his
*NL*
hardest
speed
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
whistled
again
and
again
,
and
sat
down
and
waited
in
the
*NL*
expectation
that
he
would
return
.
But
no
dog
appeared
,
and
at
length
*NL*
he
resumed
his
journey
.

CHAPTER
XLIX
*NL*
*NL*
MONKS
AND
MR.
BROWNLOW
AT
LENGTH
MEET
.
THEIR
CONVERSATION
,
AND
THE
*NL*
INTELLIGENCE
THAT
INTERRUPTS
IT
*NL*
*NL*
The
twilight
was
beginning
to
close
in
,
when
Mr.
Brownlow
*NL*
alighted
from
a
hackney-coach
at
his
own
door
,
and
knocked
softly
.
The
*NL*
door
being
opened
,
a
sturdy
man
got
out
of
the
coach
and
stationed
*NL*
himself
on
one
side
of
the
steps
,
while
another
man
,
who
had
been
*NL*
seated
on
the
box
,
dismounted
too
,
and
stood
upon
the
other
side
.
At
a
*NL*
sign
from
Mr.
Brownlow
,
they
helped
out
a
third
man
,
and
taking
him
*NL*
between
them
,
hurried
him
into
the
house
.
This
man
was
Monks
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
walked
in
the
same
manner
up
the
stairs
without
speaking
,
and
Mr.
*NL*
Brownlow
,
preceding
them
,
led
the
way
into
a
back-room
.
At
the
door
of
*NL*
this
apartment
,
Monks
,
who
had
ascended
with
evident
reluctance
,
*NL*
stopped
.
The
two
men
looked
at
the
old
gentleman
as
if
for
*NL*
instructions
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
knows
the
alternative
,
'
said
Mr.
Browlow
.
`
If
he
hesitates
or
*NL*
moves
a
finger
but
as
you
bid
him
,
drag
him
into
the
street
,
call
for
*NL*
the
aid
of
the
police
,
and
impeach
him
as
a
felon
in
my
name
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
How
dare
you
say
this
of
me
?
'
asked
Monks
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
How
dare
you
urge
me
to
it
,
young
man
?
'
replied
Mr.
Brownlow
,
*NL*
confronting
him
with
a
steady
look
.
`
Are
you
mad
enough
to
leave
this
*NL*
house
?
Unhand
him
.
There
,
sir
.
You
are
free
to
go
,
and
we
to
follow
.
*NL*
But
I
warn
you
,
by
all
I
hold
most
solemn
and
most
sacred
,
that
instant
*NL*
will
have
you
apprehended
on
a
charge
of
fraud
and
robbery
.
I
am
*NL*
resolute
and
immoveable
.
If
you
are
determined
to
be
the
same
,
your
*NL*
blood
be
upon
your
own
head
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
By
what
authority
am
I
kidnapped
in
the
street
,
and
brought
here
by
*NL*
these
dogs
?
'
asked
Monks
,
looking
from
one
to
the
other
of
the
men
who
*NL*
stood
beside
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
By
mine
,
'
replied
Mr.
Brownlow
.
`
Those
persons
are
indemnified
by
me
.
*NL*
If
you
complain
of
being
deprived
of
your
liberty
--
you
had
power
and
*NL*
opportunity
to
retrieve
it
as
you
came
along
,
but
you
deemed
it
*NL*
advisable
to
remain
quiet
--
I
say
again
,
throw
yourself
for
protection
*NL*
on
the
law
.
I
will
appeal
to
the
law
too
;
but
when
you
have
gone
too
*NL*
far
to
recede
,
do
not
sue
to
me
for
leniency
,
when
the
power
will
have
*NL*
passed
into
other
hands
;
and
do
not
say
I
plunged
you
down
the
gulf
*NL*
into
which
you
rushed
,
yourself
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Monks
was
plainly
disconcerted
,
and
alarmed
besides
.
He
hesitated
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
will
decide
quickly
,
'
said
Mr.
Brownlow
,
with
perfect
firmness
and
*NL*
composure
.
`
If
you
wish
me
to
prefer
my
charges
publicly
,
and
consign
*NL*
you
to
a
punishment
the
extent
of
which
,
although
I
can
,
with
a
*NL*
shudder
,
foresee
,
I
can
not
control
,
once
more
,
I
say
,
for
you
know
the
*NL*
way
.
If
not
,
and
you
appeal
to
my
forbearance
,
and
the
mercy
of
those
*NL*
you
have
deeply
injured
,
seat
yourself
,
without
a
word
,
in
that
chair
.
*NL*
It
has
waited
for
you
two
whole
days
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Monks
muttered
some
unintelligible
words
,
but
wavered
still
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
will
be
prompt
,
'
said
Mr.
Brownlow
.
'
A
word
from
me
,
and
the
*NL*
alternative
has
gone
for
ever
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Still
the
man
hesitated
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
have
not
the
inclination
to
parley
,
'
said
Mr.
Brownlow
,
`
and
,
as
I
*NL*
advocate
the
dearest
interests
of
others
,
I
have
not
the
right
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Is
there
--
'
demanded
Monks
with
a
faltering
tongue
,
--
`
is
there
--
no
*NL*
middle
course
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
None
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Monks
looked
at
the
old
gentleman
,
with
an
anxious
eye
;
but
,
reading
in
*NL*
his
countenance
nothing
but
severity
and
determination
,
walked
into
the
*NL*
room
,
and
,
shrugging
his
shoulders
,
sat
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Lock
the
door
on
the
outside
,
'
said
Mr.
Brownlow
to
the
attendants
,
*NL*
`
and
come
when
I
ring
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
men
obeyed
,
and
the
two
were
left
alone
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
This
is
pretty
treatment
,
sir
,
'
said
Monks
,
throwing
down
his
hat
and
*NL*
cloak
,
`
from
my
father
's
oldest
friend
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
is
because
I
was
your
father
's
oldest
friend
,
young
man
,
'
returned
*NL*
Mr.
Brownlow
;
`
it
is
because
the
hopes
and
wishes
of
young
and
happy
*NL*
years
were
bound
up
with
him
,
and
that
fair
creature
of
his
blood
and
*NL*
kindred
who
rejoined
her
God
in
youth
,
and
left
me
here
a
solitary
,
*NL*
lonely
man
:
it
is
because
he
knelt
with
me
beside
his
only
sisters
'
*NL*
death-bed
when
he
was
yet
a
boy
,
on
the
morning
that
would
--
but
Heaven
*NL*
willed
otherwise
--
have
made
her
my
young
wife
;
it
is
because
my
seared
*NL*
heart
clung
to
him
,
from
that
time
forth
,
through
all
his
trials
and
*NL*
errors
,
till
he
died
;
it
is
because
old
recollections
and
associations
*NL*
filled
my
heart
,
and
even
the
sight
of
you
brings
with
it
old
thoughts
*NL*
of
him
;
it
is
because
of
all
these
things
that
I
am
moved
to
treat
you
*NL*
gently
now
--
yes
,
Edward
Leeford
,
even
now
--
and
blush
for
your
*NL*
unworthiness
who
bear
the
name
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
has
the
name
to
do
with
it
?
'
asked
the
other
,
after
*NL*
contemplating
,
half
in
silence
,
and
half
in
dogged
wonder
,
the
*NL*
agitation
of
his
companion
.
`
What
is
the
name
to
me
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Nothing
,
'
replied
Mr.
Brownlow
,
`
nothing
to
you
.
But
it
was
_
hers
_
,
*NL*
and
even
at
this
distance
of
time
brings
back
to
me
,
an
old
man
,
the
*NL*
glow
and
thrill
which
I
once
felt
,
only
to
hear
it
repeated
by
a
*NL*
stranger
.
I
am
very
glad
you
have
changed
it
--
very
--
very
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
This
is
all
mighty
fine
,
'
said
Monks
-LRB-
to
retain
his
assumed
*NL*
designation
-RRB-
after
a
long
silence
,
during
which
he
had
jerked
himself
*NL*
in
sullen
defiance
to
and
fro
,
and
Mr.
Brownlow
had
sat
,
shading
his
*NL*
face
with
his
hand
.
`
But
what
do
you
want
with
me
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
have
a
brother
,
'
said
Mr.
Brownlow
,
rousing
himself
:
'
a
brother
,
*NL*
the
whisper
of
whose
name
in
your
ear
when
I
came
behind
you
in
the
*NL*
street
,
was
,
in
itself
,
almost
enough
to
make
you
accompany
me
hither
,
*NL*
in
wonder
and
alarm
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
have
no
brother
,
'
replied
Monks
.
`
You
know
I
was
an
only
child
.
*NL*
Why
do
you
talk
to
me
of
brothers
?
You
know
that
,
as
well
as
I.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Attend
to
what
I
do
know
,
and
you
may
not
,
'
said
Mr.
Brownlow
.
'
I
*NL*
shall
interest
you
by
and
by
.
I
know
that
of
the
wretched
marriage
,
*NL*
into
which
family
pride
,
and
the
most
sordid
and
narrowest
of
all
*NL*
ambition
,
forced
your
unhappy
father
when
a
mere
boy
,
you
were
the
sole
*NL*
and
most
unnatural
issue
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
do
n't
care
for
hard
names
,
'
interrupted
Monks
with
a
jeering
laugh
.
*NL*
`
You
know
the
fact
,
and
that
's
enough
for
me
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
I
also
know
,
'
pursued
the
old
gentleman
,
`
the
misery
,
the
slow
*NL*
torture
,
the
protracted
anguish
of
that
ill-assorted
union
.
I
know
how
*NL*
listlessly
and
wearily
each
of
that
wretched
pair
dragged
on
their
*NL*
heavy
chain
through
a
world
that
was
poisoned
to
them
both
.
I
know
how
*NL*
cold
formalities
were
succeeded
by
open
taunts
;
how
indifference
gave
*NL*
place
to
dislike
,
dislike
to
hate
,
and
hate
to
loathing
,
until
at
last
*NL*
they
wrenched
the
clanking
bond
asunder
,
and
retiring
a
wide
space
*NL*
apart
,
carried
each
a
galling
fragment
,
of
which
nothing
but
death
*NL*
could
break
the
rivets
,
to
hide
it
in
new
society
beneath
the
gayest
*NL*
looks
they
could
assume
.
Your
mother
succeeded
;
she
forgot
it
soon
.
*NL*
But
it
rusted
and
cankered
at
your
father
's
heart
for
years
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
they
were
separated
,
'
said
Monks
,
`
and
what
of
that
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
When
they
had
been
separated
for
some
time
,
'
returned
Mr.
Brownlow
,
*NL*
`
and
your
mother
,
wholly
given
up
to
continental
frivolities
,
had
*NL*
utterly
forgotten
the
young
husband
ten
good
years
her
junior
,
who
,
*NL*
with
prospects
blighted
,
lingered
on
at
home
,
he
fell
among
new
*NL*
friends
.
This
circumstance
,
at
least
,
you
know
already
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Not
I
,
'
said
Monks
,
turning
away
his
eyes
and
beating
his
foot
upon
*NL*
the
ground
,
as
a
man
who
is
determined
to
deny
everything
.
`
Not
I.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Your
manner
,
no
less
than
your
actions
,
assures
me
that
you
have
never
*NL*
forgotten
it
,
or
ceased
to
think
of
it
with
bitterness
,
'
returned
Mr.
*NL*
Brownlow
.
'
I
speak
of
fifteen
years
ago
,
when
you
were
not
more
than
*NL*
eleven
years
old
,
and
your
father
but
one-and-thirty
--
for
he
was
,
I
*NL*
repeat
,
a
boy
,
when
_
his
_
father
ordered
him
to
marry
.
Must
I
go
back
*NL*
to
events
which
cast
a
shade
upon
the
memory
of
your
parent
,
or
will
*NL*
you
spare
it
,
and
disclose
to
me
the
truth
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
have
nothing
to
disclose
,
'
rejoined
Monks
.
`
You
must
talk
on
if
you
*NL*
will
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
These
new
friends
,
then
,
'
said
Mr.
Brownlow
,
`
were
a
naval
officer
*NL*
retired
from
active
service
,
whose
wife
had
died
some
half-a-year
*NL*
before
,
and
left
him
with
two
children
--
there
had
been
more
,
but
,
of
*NL*
all
their
family
,
happily
but
two
survived
.
They
were
both
daughters
;
*NL*
one
a
beautiful
creature
of
nineteen
,
and
the
other
a
mere
child
of
two
*NL*
or
three
years
old
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
's
this
to
me
?
'
asked
Monks
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
They
resided
,
'
said
Mr.
Brownlow
,
without
seeming
to
hear
the
*NL*
interruption
,
`
in
a
part
of
the
country
to
which
your
father
in
his
*NL*
wandering
had
repaired
,
and
where
he
had
taken
up
his
abode
.
*NL*
Acquaintance
,
intimacy
,
friendship
,
fast
followed
on
each
other
.
Your
*NL*
father
was
gifted
as
few
men
are
.
He
had
his
sister
's
soul
and
person
.
*NL*
As
the
old
officer
knew
him
more
and
more
,
he
grew
to
love
him
.
I
*NL*
would
that
it
had
ended
there
.
His
daughter
did
the
same
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
gentleman
paused
;
Monks
was
biting
his
lips
,
with
his
eyes
*NL*
fixed
upon
the
floor
;
seeing
this
,
he
immediately
resumed
:
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
end
of
a
year
found
him
contracted
,
solemnly
contracted
,
to
that
*NL*
daughter
;
the
object
of
the
first
,
true
,
ardent
,
only
passion
of
a
*NL*
guileless
girl
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Your
tale
is
of
the
longest
,
'
observed
Monks
,
moving
restlessly
in
his
*NL*
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
is
a
true
tale
of
grief
and
trial
,
and
sorrow
,
young
man
,
'
returned
*NL*
Mr.
Brownlow
,
`
and
such
tales
usually
are
;
if
it
were
one
of
unmixed
*NL*
joy
and
happiness
,
it
would
be
very
brief
.
At
length
one
of
those
rich
*NL*
relations
to
strengthen
whose
interest
and
importance
your
father
had
*NL*
been
sacrificed
,
as
others
are
often
--
it
is
no
uncommon
case
--
died
,
and
*NL*
to
repair
the
misery
he
had
been
instrumental
in
occasioning
,
left
him
*NL*
his
panacea
for
all
griefs
--
Money
.
It
was
necessary
that
he
should
*NL*
immediately
repair
to
Rome
,
whither
this
man
had
sped
for
health
,
and
*NL*
where
he
had
died
,
leaving
his
affairs
in
great
confusion
.
He
went
;
*NL*
was
seized
with
mortal
illness
there
;
was
followed
,
the
moment
the
*NL*
intelligence
reached
Paris
,
by
your
mother
who
carried
you
with
her
;
he
*NL*
died
the
day
after
her
arrival
,
leaving
no
will
--
_
no
will
_
--
so
that
the
*NL*
whole
property
fell
to
her
and
you
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
part
of
the
recital
Monks
held
his
breath
,
and
listened
with
a
*NL*
face
of
intense
eagerness
,
though
his
eyes
were
not
directed
towards
*NL*
the
speaker
.
As
Mr.
Brownlow
paused
,
he
changed
his
position
with
the
*NL*
air
of
one
who
has
experienced
a
sudden
relief
,
and
wiped
his
hot
face
*NL*
and
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Before
he
went
abroad
,
and
as
he
passed
through
London
on
his
way
,
'
*NL*
said
Mr.
Brownlow
,
slowly
,
and
fixing
his
eyes
upon
the
other
's
face
,
*NL*
`
he
came
to
me
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
never
heard
of
that
,
'
interrupted
Monks
in
a
tone
intended
to
appear
*NL*
incredulous
,
but
savouring
more
of
disagreeable
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
came
to
me
,
and
left
with
me
,
among
some
other
things
,
a
picture
--
a
*NL*
portrait
painted
by
himself
--
a
likeness
of
this
poor
girl
--
which
he
did
*NL*
not
wish
to
leave
behind
,
and
could
not
carry
forward
on
his
hasty
*NL*
journey
.
He
was
worn
by
anxiety
and
remorse
almost
to
a
shadow
;
talked
*NL*
in
a
wild
,
distracted
way
,
of
ruin
and
dishonour
worked
by
himself
;
*NL*
confided
to
me
his
intention
to
convert
his
whole
property
,
at
any
*NL*
loss
,
into
money
,
and
,
having
settled
on
his
wife
and
you
a
portion
of
*NL*
his
recent
acquisition
,
to
fly
the
country
--
I
guessed
too
well
he
would
*NL*
not
fly
alone
--
and
never
see
it
more
.
Even
from
me
,
his
old
and
early
*NL*
friend
,
whose
strong
attachment
had
taken
root
in
the
earth
that
*NL*
covered
one
most
dear
to
both
--
even
from
me
he
withheld
any
more
*NL*
particular
confession
,
promising
to
write
and
tell
me
all
,
and
after
*NL*
that
to
see
me
once
again
,
for
the
last
time
on
earth
.
Alas
!
_
That
_
*NL*
was
the
last
time
.
I
had
no
letter
,
and
I
never
saw
him
more
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
went
,
'
said
Mr.
Brownlow
,
after
a
short
pause
,
'
I
went
,
when
all
was
*NL*
over
,
to
the
scene
of
his
--
I
will
use
the
term
the
world
would
freely
*NL*
use
,
for
worldly
harshness
or
favour
are
now
alike
to
him
--
of
his
*NL*
guilty
love
,
resolved
that
if
my
fears
were
realised
that
erring
child
*NL*
should
find
one
heart
and
home
to
shelter
and
compassionate
her
.
The
*NL*
family
had
left
that
part
a
week
before
;
they
had
called
in
such
*NL*
trifling
debts
as
were
outstanding
,
discharged
them
,
and
left
the
place
*NL*
by
night
.
Why
,
or
whither
,
none
can
tell
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Monks
drew
his
breath
yet
more
freely
,
and
looked
round
with
a
smile
of
*NL*
triumph
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
When
your
brother
,
'
said
Mr.
Brownlow
,
drawing
nearer
to
the
other
's
*NL*
chair
,
`
When
your
brother
:
a
feeble
,
ragged
,
neglected
child
:
was
*NL*
cast
in
my
way
by
a
stronger
hand
than
chance
,
and
rescued
by
me
from
a
*NL*
life
of
vice
and
infamy
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
?
'
cried
Monks
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
By
me
,
'
said
Mr.
Brownlow
.
'
I
told
you
I
should
interest
you
before
*NL*
long
.
I
say
by
me
--
I
see
that
your
cunning
associate
suppressed
my
*NL*
name
,
although
for
ought
he
knew
,
it
would
be
quite
strange
to
your
*NL*
ears
.
When
he
was
rescued
by
me
,
then
,
and
lay
recovering
from
*NL*
sickness
in
my
house
,
his
strong
resemblance
to
this
picture
I
have
*NL*
spoken
of
,
struck
me
with
astonishment
.
Even
when
I
first
saw
him
in
*NL*
all
his
dirt
and
misery
,
there
was
a
lingering
expression
in
his
face
*NL*
that
came
upon
me
like
a
glimpse
of
some
old
friend
flashing
on
one
in
*NL*
a
vivid
dream
.
I
need
not
tell
you
he
was
snared
away
before
I
knew
*NL*
his
history
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
not
?
'
asked
Monks
hastily
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Because
you
know
it
well
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Denial
to
me
is
vain
,
'
replied
Mr.
Brownlow
.
'
I
shall
show
you
that
I
*NL*
know
more
than
that
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
--
you
--
ca
n't
prove
anything
against
me
,
'
stammered
Monks
.
'
I
defy
*NL*
you
to
do
it
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
We
shall
see
,
'
returned
the
old
gentleman
with
a
searching
glance
.
'
I
*NL*
lost
the
boy
,
and
no
efforts
of
mine
could
recover
him
.
Your
mother
*NL*
being
dead
,
I
knew
that
you
alone
could
solve
the
mystery
if
anybody
*NL*
could
,
and
as
when
I
had
last
heard
of
you
you
were
on
your
own
estate
*NL*
in
the
West
Indies
--
whither
,
as
you
well
know
,
you
retired
upon
your
*NL*
mother
's
death
to
escape
the
consequences
of
vicious
courses
here
--
I
*NL*
made
the
voyage
.
You
had
left
it
,
months
before
,
and
were
supposed
to
*NL*
be
in
London
,
but
no
one
could
tell
where
.
I
returned
.
Your
agents
*NL*
had
no
clue
to
your
residence
.
You
came
and
went
,
they
said
,
as
*NL*
strangely
as
you
had
ever
done
:
sometimes
for
days
together
and
*NL*
sometimes
not
for
months
:
keeping
to
all
appearance
the
same
low
*NL*
haunts
and
mingling
with
the
same
infamous
herd
who
had
been
your
*NL*
associates
when
a
fierce
ungovernable
boy
.
I
wearied
them
with
new
*NL*
applications
.
I
paced
the
streets
by
night
and
day
,
but
until
two
*NL*
hours
ago
,
all
my
efforts
were
fruitless
,
and
I
never
saw
you
for
an
*NL*
instant
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
now
you
do
see
me
,
'
said
Monks
,
rising
boldly
,
`
what
then
?
Fraud
*NL*
and
robbery
are
high-sounding
words
--
justified
,
you
think
,
by
a
fancied
*NL*
resemblance
in
some
young
imp
to
an
idle
daub
of
a
dead
man
's
Brother
!
*NL*
You
do
n't
even
know
that
a
child
was
born
of
this
maudlin
pair
;
you
*NL*
do
n't
even
know
that
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
_
did
not
_
,
'
replied
Mr.
Brownlow
,
rising
too
;
`
but
within
the
last
*NL*
fortnight
I
have
learnt
it
all
.
You
have
a
brother
;
you
know
it
,
and
*NL*
him
.
There
was
a
will
,
which
your
mother
destroyed
,
leaving
the
secret
*NL*
and
the
gain
to
you
at
her
own
death
.
It
contained
a
reference
to
some
*NL*
child
likely
to
be
the
result
of
this
sad
connection
,
which
child
was
*NL*
born
,
and
accidentally
encountered
by
you
,
when
your
suspicions
were
*NL*
first
awakened
by
his
resemblance
to
your
father
.
You
repaired
to
the
*NL*
place
of
his
birth
.
There
existed
proofs
--
proofs
long
suppressed
--
of
*NL*
his
birth
and
parentage
.
Those
proofs
were
destroyed
by
you
,
and
now
,
*NL*
in
your
own
words
to
your
accomplice
the
Jew
,
''
_
the
only
proofs
of
the
*NL*
boy
's
identity
lie
at
the
bottom
of
the
river
,
and
the
old
hag
that
*NL*
received
them
from
the
mother
is
rotting
in
her
coffin
_
.
''
Unworthy
son
,
*NL*
coward
,
liar
,
--
you
,
who
hold
your
councils
with
thieves
and
murderers
*NL*
in
dark
rooms
at
night
,
--
you
,
whose
plots
and
wiles
have
brought
a
*NL*
violent
death
upon
the
head
of
one
worth
millions
such
as
you
,
--
you
,
*NL*
who
from
your
cradle
were
gall
and
bitterness
to
your
own
father
's
*NL*
heart
,
and
in
whom
all
evil
passions
,
vice
,
and
profligacy
,
festered
,
*NL*
till
they
found
a
vent
in
a
hideous
disease
which
had
made
your
face
an
*NL*
index
even
to
your
mind
--
you
,
Edward
Leeford
,
do
you
still
brave
me
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
no
,
no
!
'
returned
the
coward
,
overwhelmed
by
these
accumulated
*NL*
charges
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Every
word
!
'
cried
the
gentleman
,
`
every
word
that
has
passed
between
*NL*
you
and
this
detested
villain
,
is
known
to
me
.
Shadows
on
the
wall
*NL*
have
caught
your
whispers
,
and
brought
them
to
my
ear
;
the
sight
of
the
*NL*
persecuted
child
has
turned
vice
itself
,
and
given
it
the
courage
and
*NL*
almost
the
attributes
of
virtue
.
Murder
has
been
done
,
to
which
you
*NL*
were
morally
if
not
really
a
party
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
no
,
'
interposed
Monks
.
`
I
--
I
knew
nothing
of
that
;
I
was
going
to
*NL*
inquire
the
truth
of
the
story
when
you
overtook
me
.
I
did
n't
know
the
*NL*
cause
.
I
thought
it
was
a
common
quarrel
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
was
the
partial
disclosure
of
your
secrets
,
'
replied
Mr.
Brownlow
.
*NL*
`
Will
you
disclose
the
whole
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
I
will
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Set
your
hand
to
a
statement
of
truth
and
facts
,
and
repeat
it
before
*NL*
witnesses
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
I
promise
too
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Remain
quietly
here
,
until
such
a
document
is
drawn
up
,
and
proceed
*NL*
with
me
to
such
a
place
as
I
may
deem
most
advisable
,
for
the
purpose
*NL*
of
attesting
it
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
If
you
insist
upon
that
,
I
'll
do
that
also
,
'
replied
Monks
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
must
do
more
than
that
,
'
said
Mr.
Brownlow
.
`
Make
restitution
to
*NL*
an
innocent
and
unoffending
child
,
for
such
he
is
,
although
the
*NL*
offspring
of
a
guilty
and
most
miserable
love
.
You
have
not
forgotten
*NL*
the
provisions
of
the
will
.
Carry
them
into
execution
so
far
as
your
*NL*
brother
is
concerned
,
and
then
go
where
you
please
.
In
this
world
you
*NL*
need
meet
no
more

'
*NL*
*NL*
While
Monks
was
pacing
up
and
down
,
meditating
with
dark
and
evil
looks
*NL*
on
this
proposal
and
the
possibilities
of
evading
it
:
torn
by
his
*NL*
fears
on
the
one
hand
and
his
hatred
on
the
other
:
the
door
was
*NL*
hurriedly
unlocked
,
and
a
gentleman
-LRB-
Mr.
Losberne
-RRB-
entered
the
room
in
*NL*
violent
agitation
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
man
will
be
taken
,
'
he
cried
.
`
He
will
be
taken
to-night
!

*NL*
*NL*
`
The
murderer
?
'
asked
Mr.
Brownlow
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
yes
,
'
replied
the
other
.
`
His
dog
has
been
seen
lurking
about
*NL*
some
old
haunt
,
and
there
seems
little
doubt
that
his
master
either
is
,
*NL*
or
will
be
,
there
,
under
cover
of
the
darkness
.
Spies
are
hovering
*NL*
about
in
every
direction
.
I
have
spoken
to
the
men
who
are
charged
*NL*
with
his
capture
,
and
they
tell
me
he
can
not
escape
.
A
reward
of
a
*NL*
hundred
pounds
is
proclaimed
by
Government
to-night
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
will
give
fifty
more
,
'
said
Mr.
Brownlow
,
`
and
proclaim
it
with
my
*NL*
own
lips
upon
the
spot
,
if
I
can
reach
it

Where
is
Mr.
Maylie
?

*NL*
*NL*
`
Harry
?
As
soon
as
he
had
seen
your
friend
here
,
safe
in
a
coach
with
*NL*
you
,
he
hurried
off
to
where
he
heard
this

replied
the
doctor
,
`

*NL*
mounting
his
horse
sallied
forth
to
join
the
first
party
at
some
place
*NL*
in
the
outskirts
agreed
upon
between
them

said
Mr.

'
*NL*
*NL*
`
When
I
last
heard
,
he

this
time

They

asked
Mr.

of

Monks

*NL*
`
Yes
,
'
he
replied
.
`
You
--
you
--
will
be
secret
with
me
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
will
.
Remain
here
till
I
return
.
It
is
your
only
hope
of
safety
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
They
left
the
room
,
and
the
door
was
again
locked
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
have
you
done
?
'
asked
the
doctor
in
a
whisper
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
All
that
I
could
hope
to
do
,
and
even
more
.
Coupling
the
poor
girl
's
*NL*
intelligence
with
my
previous
knowledge
,
and
the
result
of
our
good
*NL*
friend
's
inquiries
on
the
spot
,
I
left
him
no
loophole
of
escape
,
and
*NL*
laid
bare
the
whole
villainy
which
by
these
lights
became
plain
as
day
.
*NL*
Write
and
appoint
the
evening
after
to-morrow
,
at
seven
,
for
the
*NL*
meeting
.
We
shall
be
down
there
,
a
few
hours
before
,
but
shall
require
*NL*
rest
:
especially
the
young
lady
,
who
_
may
_
have
greater
need
of
*NL*
firmness
than
either
you
or
I
can
quite
foresee
just
now
.
But
my
blood
*NL*
boils
to
avenge
this
poor
murdered
creature
.
Which
way
have
they
*NL*
taken
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Drive
straight
to
the
office
and
you
will
be
in
time
,
'
replied
Mr.
*NL*
Losberne
.
'
I
will
remain
here
.

The
two
gentlemen
hastily
separated
;
each
in
a
fever
of
excitement
*NL*
wholly
uncontrollable

CHAPTER
L
*NL*
*NL*
THE
PURSUIT
AND
ESCAPE
*NL*
*NL*
Near
to
that
part
of
the
Thames
on
which
the
church
at
Rotherhithe
*NL*
abuts
,
where
the
buildings
on
the
banks
are
dirtiest
and
the
vessels
on
*NL*
the
river
blackest
with
the
dust
of
colliers
and
the
smoke
of
*NL*
close-built
low-roofed
houses
,
there
exists
the
filthiest
,
the
*NL*
strangest
,
the
most
extraordinary
of
the
many
localities
that
are
*NL*
hidden
in
London
,
wholly
unknown
,
even
by
name
,
to
the
great
mass
of
*NL*
its
inhabitants
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
reach
this
place
,
the
visitor
has
to
penetrate
through
a
maze
of
*NL*
close
,
narrow
,
and
muddy
streets
,
thronged
by
the
roughest
and
poorest
*NL*
of
waterside
people
,
and
devoted
to
the
traffic
they
may
be
supposed
to
*NL*
occasion
.
The
cheapest
and
least
delicate
provisions
are
heaped
in
the
*NL*
shops
;
the
coarsest
and
commonest
articles
of
wearing
apparel
dangle
at
*NL*
the
salesman
's
door
,
and
stream
from
the
house-parapet
and
windows
.
*NL*
Jostling
with
unemployed
labourers
of
the
lowest
class
,
*NL*
ballast-heavers
,
coal-whippers
,
brazen
women
,
ragged
children
,
and
the
*NL*
raff
and
refuse
of
the
river
,
he
makes
his
way
with
difficulty
along
,
*NL*
assailed
by
offensive
sights
and
smells
from
the
narrow
alleys
which
*NL*
branch
off
on
the
right
and
left
,
and
deafened
by
the
clash
of
*NL*
ponderous
waggons
that
bear
great
piles
of
merchandise
from
the
stacks
*NL*
of
warehouses
that
rise
from
every
corner
.
Arriving
,
at
length
,
in
*NL*
streets
remoter
and
less-frequented
than
those
through
which
he
has
*NL*
passed
,
he
walks
beneath
tottering
house-fronts
projecting
over
the
*NL*
pavement
,
dismantled
walls
that
seem
to
totter
as
he
passes
,
chimneys
*NL*
half
crushed
half
hesitating
to
fall
,
windows
guarded
by
rusty
iron
*NL*
bars
that
time
and
dirt
have
almost
eaten
away
,
every
imaginable
sign
*NL*
of
desolation
and
neglect
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
such
a
neighborhood
,
beyond
Dockhead
in
the
Borough
of
Southwark
,
*NL*
stands
Jacob
's
Island
,
surrounded
by
a
muddy
ditch
,
six
or
eight
feet
*NL*
deep
and
fifteen
or
twenty
wide
when
the
tide
is
in
,
once
called
Mill
*NL*
Pond
,
but
known
in
the
days
of
this
story
as
Folly
Ditch
.
It
is
a
*NL*
creek
or
inlet
from
the
Thames
,
and
can
always
be
filled
at
high
water
*NL*
by
opening
the
sluices
at
the
Lead
Mills
from
which
it
took
its
old
*NL*
name
.
At
such
times
,
a
stranger
,
looking
from
one
of
the
wooden
*NL*
bridges
thrown
across
it
at
Mill
Lane
,
will
see
the
inhabitants
of
the
*NL*
houses
on
either
side
lowering
from
their
back
doors
and
windows
,
*NL*
buckets
,
pails
,
domestic
utensils
of
all
kinds
,
in
which
to
haul
the
*NL*
water
up
;
and
when
his
eye
is
turned
from
these
operations
to
the
*NL*
houses
themselves
,
his
utmost
astonishment
will
be
excited
by
the
scene
*NL*
before
him
.
Crazy
wooden
galleries
common
to
the
backs
of
half
a
dozen
*NL*
houses
,
with
holes
from
which
to
look
upon
the
slime
beneath
;
windows
,
*NL*
broken
and
patched
,
with
poles
thrust
out
,
on
which
to
dry
the
linen
*NL*
that
is
never
there
;
rooms
so
small
,
so
filthy
,
so
confined
,
that
the
*NL*
air
would
seem
too
tainted
even
for
the
dirt
and
squalor
which
they
*NL*
shelter
;
wooden
chambers
thrusting
themselves
out
above
the
mud
,
and
*NL*
threatening
to
fall
into
it
--
as
some
have
done
;
dirt-besmeared
walls
*NL*
and
decaying
foundations
;
every
repulsive
lineament
of
poverty
,
every
*NL*
loathsome
indication
of
filth
,
rot
,
and
garbage
;
all
these
ornament
the
*NL*
banks
of
Folly
Ditch
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
Jacob
's
Island
,
the
warehouses
are
roofless
and
empty
;
the
walls
are
*NL*
crumbling
down
;
the
windows
are
windows
no
more
;
the
doors
are
falling
*NL*
into
the
streets
;
the
chimneys
are
blackened
,
but
they
yield
no
smoke
.
*NL*
Thirty
or
forty
years
ago
,
before
losses
and
chancery
suits
came
upon
*NL*
it
,
it
was
a
thriving
place
;
but
now
it
is
a
desolate
island
indeed
.
*NL*
The
houses
have
no
owners
;
they
are
broken
open
,
and
entered
upon
by
*NL*
those
who
have
the
courage
;
and
there
they
live
,
and
there
they
die
.
*NL*
They
must
have
powerful
motives
for
a
secret
residence
,
or
be
reduced
*NL*
to
a
destitute
condition
indeed
,
who
seek
a
refuge
in
Jacob
's
Island
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
an
upper
room
of
one
of
these
houses
--
a
detached
house
of
fair
size
,
*NL*
ruinous
in
other
respects
,
but
strongly
defended
at
door
and
window
:
*NL*
of
which
house
the
back
commanded
the
ditch
in
manner
already
*NL*
described
--
there
were
assembled
three
men
,
who
,
regarding
each
other
*NL*
every
now
and
then
with
looks
expressive
of
perplexity
and
expectation
,
*NL*
sat
for
some
time
in
profound
and
gloomy
silence
.
One
of
these
was
*NL*
Toby
Crackit
,
another
Mr.
Chitling
,
and
the
third
a
robber
of
fifty
*NL*
years
,
whose
nose
had
been
almost
beaten
in
,
in
some
old
scuffle
,
and
*NL*
whose
face
bore
a
frightful
scar
which
might
probably
be
traced
to
the
*NL*
same
occasion
.
This
man
was
a
returned
transport
,
and
his
name
was
*NL*
Kags
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
wish
,
'
said
Toby
turning
to
Mr.
Chitling
,
`
that
you
had
picked
out
*NL*
some
other
crib
when
the
two
old
ones
got
too
warm
,
and
had
not
come
*NL*
here
,
my
fine
feller
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
did
n't
you
,
blunder-head
!
'
said
Kags
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
I
thought
you
'd
have
been
a
little
more
glad
to
see
me
than
*NL*
this
,
'
replied
Mr.
Chitling
,
with
a
melancholy
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
look
`
e
,
young
gentleman
,
'
said
Toby
,
`
when
a
man
keeps
himself
so
*NL*
very
ex-clusive
as
I
have
done
,
and
by
that
means
has
a
snug
house
over
*NL*
his
head
with
nobody
a
prying
and
smelling
about
it
,
it
's
rather
a
*NL*
startling
thing
to
have
the
honour
of
a
wisit
from
a
young
gentleman
*NL*
-LRB-
however
respectable
and
pleasant
a
person
he
may
be
to
play
cards
with
*NL*
at
conweniency
-RRB-
circumstanced
as
you
are
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Especially
,
when
the
exclusive
young
man
has
got
a
friend
stopping
*NL*
with
him
,
that
's
arrived
sooner
than
was
expected
from
foreign
parts
,
*NL*
and
is
too
modest
to
want
to
be
presented
to
the
Judges
on
his
return
,
'
*NL*
added
Mr.
Kags
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
short
silence
,
after
which
Toby
Crackit
,
seeming
to
abandon
*NL*
as
hopeless
any
further
effort
to
maintain
his
usual
devil-may-care
*NL*
swagger
,
turned
to
Chitling
and
said
,
*NL*
*NL*
`
When
was
Fagin
took
then
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Just
at
dinner-time
--
two
o'clock
this
afternoon
.
Charley
and
I
made
*NL*
our
lucky
up
the
wash-us
chimney
,
and
Bolter
got
into
the
empty
*NL*
water-butt
,
head
downwards
;
but
his
legs
were
so
precious
long
that
*NL*
they
stuck
out
at
the
top
,
and
so
they
took
him
too
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
Bet
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Poor
Bet
!
She
went
to
see
the
Body
,
to
speak
to
who
it
was
,
'
replied
*NL*
Chitling
,
his
countenance
falling
more
and
more
,
`
and
went
off
mad
,
*NL*
screaming
and
raving
,
and
beating
her
head
against
the
boards
;
so
they
*NL*
put
a
strait-weskut
on
her
and
took
her
to
the
hospital
--
and
there
she
*NL*
is
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Wot
's
come
of
young
Bates
?
'
demanded
Kags
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
hung
about
,
not
to
come
over
here
afore
dark
,
but
he
'll
be
here
*NL*
soon
,
'
replied
Chitling
.
`
There
's
nowhere
else
to
go
to
now
,
for
the
*NL*
people
at
the
Cripples
are
all
in
custody
,
and
the
bar
of
the
ken
--
I
*NL*
went
up
there
and
see
it
with
my
own
eyes
--
is
filled
with
traps
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
This
is
a
smash
,
'
observed
Toby
,
biting
his
lips
.
`
There
's
more
than
*NL*
one
will
go
with
this
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
sessions
are
on
,
'
said
Kags
:
`
if
they
get
the
inquest
over
,
and
*NL*
Bolter
turns
King
's
evidence
:
as
of
course
he
will
,
from
what
he
's
*NL*
said
already
:
they
can
prove
Fagin
an
accessory
before
the
fact
,
and
*NL*
get
the
trial
on
on
Friday
,
and
he
'll
swing
in
six
days
from
this
,
by
*NL*
G
--
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
should
have
heard
the
people
groan
,
'
said
Chitling
;
`
the
officers
*NL*
fought
like
devils
,
or
they
'd
have
torn
him
away
.
He
was
down
once
,
*NL*
but
they
made
a
ring
round
him
,
and
fought
their
way
along
.
You
should
*NL*
have
seen
how
he
looked
about
him
,
all
muddy
and
bleeding
,
and
clung
to
*NL*
them
as
if
they
were
his
dearest
friends
.
I
can
see
'em
now
,
not
able
*NL*
to
stand
upright
with
the
pressing
of
the
mob
,
and
draggin
him
along
*NL*
amongst
'em
;
I
can
see
the
people
jumping
up
,
one
behind
another
,
and
*NL*
snarling
with
their
teeth
and
making
at
him
;
I
can
see
the
blood
upon
*NL*
his
hair
and
beard
,
and
hear
the
cries
with
which
the
women
worked
*NL*
themselves
into
the
centre
of
the
crowd
at
the
street
corner
,
and
swore
*NL*
they
'd
tear
his
heart
out
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
horror-stricken
witness
of
this
scene
pressed
his
hands
upon
his
*NL*
ears
,
and
with
his
eyes
closed
got
up
and
paced
violently
to
and
fro
,
*NL*
like
one
distracted
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
he
was
thus
engaged
,
and
the
two
men
sat
by
in
silence
with
their
*NL*
eyes
fixed
upon
the
floor
,
a
pattering
noise
was
heard
upon
the
stairs
,
*NL*
and
Sikes
's
dog
bounded
into
the
room
.
They
ran
to
the
window
,
*NL*
downstairs
,
and
into
the
street
.
The
dog
had
jumped
in
at
an
open
*NL*
window
;
he
made
no
attempt
to
follow
them
,
nor
was
his
master
to
be
*NL*
seen
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
's
the
meaning
of
this
?
'
said
Toby
when
they
had
returned
.
`
He
*NL*
ca
n't
be
coming
here
.
I
--
I
--
hope
not
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
If
he
was
coming
here
,
he
'd
have
come
with
the
dog
,
'
said
Kags
,
*NL*
stooping
down
to
examine
the
animal
,
who
lay
panting
on
the
floor
.
*NL*
`
Here
!
Give
us
some
water
for
him
;
he
has
run
himself
faint
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
's
drunk
it
all
up
,
every
drop
,
'
said
Chitling
after
watching
the
*NL*
dog
some
time
in
silence
.
`
Covered
with
mud
--
lame
--
half
blind
--
he
must
*NL*
have
come
a
long
way
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Where
can
he
have
come
from
!
'
exclaimed
Toby
.
`
He
's
been
to
the
other
*NL*
kens
of
course
,
and
finding
them
filled
with
strangers
come
on
here
,
*NL*
where
he
's
been
many
a
time
and
often
.
But
where
can
he
have
come
from
*NL*
first
,
and
how
comes
he
here
alone
without
the
other
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
'
--
-LRB-
none
of
them
called
the
murderer
by
his
old
name
-RRB-
--
`
He
ca
n't
*NL*
have
made
away
with
himself
.
What
do
you
think
?
'
said
Chitling
.
*NL*
*NL*
Toby
shook
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
If
he
had
,
'
said
Kags
,
`
the
dog
`
ud
want
to
lead
us
away
to
where
he
*NL*
did
it
.
No
.
I
think
he
's
got
out
of
the
country
,
and
left
the
dog
*NL*
behind
.
He
must
have
given
him
the
slip
somehow
,
or
he
would
n't
be
so
*NL*
easy
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
This
solution
,
appearing
the
most
probable
one
,
was
adopted
as
the
*NL*
right
;
the
dog
,
creeping
under
a
chair
,
coiled
himself
up
to
sleep
,
*NL*
without
more
notice
from
anybody
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
being
now
dark
,
the
shutter
was
closed
,
and
a
candle
lighted
and
*NL*
placed
upon
the
table
.
The
terrible
events
of
the
last
two
days
had
*NL*
made
a
deep
impression
on
all
three
,
increased
by
the
danger
and
*NL*
uncertainty
of
their
own
position
.
They
drew
their
chairs
closer
*NL*
together
,
starting
at
every
sound
.
They
spoke
little
,
and
that
in
*NL*
whispers
,
and
were
as
silent
and
awe-stricken
as
if
the
remains
of
the
*NL*
murdered
woman
lay
in
the
next
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
sat
thus
,
some
time
,
when
suddenly
was
heard
a
hurried
*NL*
knocking
at
the
door
below
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Young
Bates
,
'
said
Kags
,
looking
angrily
round
,
to
check
the
fear
he
*NL*
felt
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
knocking
came
again
.
No
,
it
was
n't
he
.
He
never
knocked
like
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
Crackit
went
to
the
window
,
and
shaking
all
over
,
drew
in
his
head
.
*NL*
There
was
no
need
to
tell
them
who
it
was
;
his
pale
face
was
enough
.
*NL*
The
dog
too
was
on
the
alert
in
an
instant
,
and
ran
whining
to
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
We
must
let
him
in
,
'
he
said
,
taking
up
the
candle
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Is
n't
there
any
help
for
it
?
'
asked
the
other
man
in
a
hoarse
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
None
.
He
_
must
_
come
in
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Do
n't
leave
us
in
the
dark
,
'
said
Kags
,
taking
down
a
candle
from
the
*NL*
chimney-piece
,
and
lighting
it
,
with
such
a
trembling
hand
that
the
*NL*
knocking
was
twice
repeated
before
he
had
finished
.
*NL*
*NL*
Crackit
went
down
to
the
door
,
and
returned
followed
by
a
man
with
the
*NL*
lower
part
of
his
face
buried
in
a
handkerchief
,
and
another
tied
over
*NL*
his
head
under
his
hat
.
He
drew
them
slowly
off
.
Blanched
face
,
*NL*
sunken
eyes
,
hollow
cheeks
,
beard
of
three
days
'
growth
,
wasted
flesh
,
*NL*
short
thick
breath
;
it
was
the
very
ghost
of
Sikes
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
laid
his
hand
upon
a
chair
which
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
,
*NL*
but
shuddering
as
he
was
about
to
drop
into
it
,
and
seeming
to
glance
*NL*
over
his
shoulder
,
dragged
it
back
close
to
the
wall
--
as
close
as
it
*NL*
would
go
--
and
ground
it
against
it
--
and
sat
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
a
word
had
been
exchanged
.
He
looked
from
one
to
another
in
*NL*
silence
.
If
an
eye
were
furtively
raised
and
met
his
,
it
was
instantly
*NL*
averted
.
When
his
hollow
voice
broke
silence
,
they
all
three
started
.
*NL*
They
seemed
never
to
have
heard
its
tones
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
How
came
that
dog
here
?
'
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Alone
.
Three
hours
ago
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
To-night
's
paper
says
that
Fagin
's
took
.
Is
it
true
,
or
a
lie
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
True
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
silent
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Damn
you
all
!
'
said
Sikes
,
passing
his
hand
across
his
forehead
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Have
you
nothing
to
say
to
me
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
an
uneasy
movement
among
them
,
but
nobody
spoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
that
keep
this
house
,
'
said
Sikes
,
turning
his
face
to
Crackit
,
*NL*
`
do
you
mean
to
sell
me
,
or
to
let
me
lie
here
till
this
hunt
is
over
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
may
stop
here
,
if
you
think
it
safe
,
'
returned
the
person
*NL*
addressed
,
after
some
hesitation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sikes
carried
his
eyes
slowly
up
the
wall
behind
him
:
rather
trying
to
*NL*
turn
his
head
than
actually
doing
it
:
and
said
,
`
Is
--
it
--
the
body
--
is
*NL*
it
buried
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
They
shook
their
heads
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
is
n't
it
!
'
he
retorted
with
the
same
glance
behind
him
.
`
Wot
do
*NL*
they
keep
such
ugly
things
above
the
ground
for
?
--
Who
's
that
knocking
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
Crackit
intimated
,
by
a
motion
of
his
hand
as
he
left
the
room
,
that
*NL*
there
was
nothing
to
fear
;
and
directly
came
back
with
Charley
Bates
*NL*
behind
him
.
Sikes
sat
opposite
the
door
,
so
that
the
moment
the
boy
*NL*
entered
the
room
he
encountered
his
figure
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Toby
,
'
said
the
boy
falling
back
,
as
Sikes
turned
his
eyes
towards
*NL*
him
,
`
why
did
n't
you
tell
me
this
,
downstairs
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
There
had
been
something
so
tremendous
in
the
shrinking
off
of
the
*NL*
three
,
that
the
wretched
man
was
willing
to
propitiate
even
this
lad
.
*NL*
Accordingly
he
nodded
,
and
made
as
though
he
would
shake
hands
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Let
me
go
into
some
other
room
,
'
said
the
boy
,
retreating
still
*NL*
farther
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Charley
!
'
said
Sikes
,
stepping
forward
.
`
Do
n't
you
--
do
n't
you
know
*NL*
me
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Do
n't
come
nearer
me
,
'
answered
the
boy
,
still
retreating
,
and
*NL*
looking
,
with
horror
in
his
eyes
,
upon
the
murderer
's
face
.
`
You
*NL*
monster
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
stopped
half-way
,
and
they
looked
at
each
other
;
but
Sikes
's
*NL*
eyes
sunk
gradually
to
the
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Witness
you
three
,
'
cried
the
boy
shaking
his
clenched
fist
,
and
*NL*
becoming
more
and
more
excited
as
he
spoke
.
`
Witness
you
three
--
I
'm
not
*NL*
afraid
of
him
--
if
they
come
here
after
him
,
I
'll
give
him
up
;
I
will
.
*NL*
I
tell
you
out
at
once
.
He
may
kill
me
for
it
if
he
likes
,
or
if
he
*NL*
dares
,
but
if
I
am
here
I
'll
give
him
up
.
I
'd
give
him
up
if
he
was
to
*NL*
be
boiled
alive
.
Murder
!
Help
!
If
there
's
the
pluck
of
a
man
among
*NL*
you
three
,
you
'll
help
me
.
Murder
!
Help
!
Down
with
him
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Pouring
out
these
cries
,
and
accompanying
them
with
violent
*NL*
gesticulation
,
the
boy
actually
threw
himself
,
single-handed
,
upon
the
*NL*
strong
man
,
and
in
the
intensity
of
his
energy
and
the
suddenness
of
*NL*
his
surprise
,
brought
him
heavily
to
the
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
three
spectators
seemed
quite
stupefied
.
They
offered
no
*NL*
interference
,
and
the
boy
and
man
rolled
on
the
ground
together
;
the
*NL*
former
,
heedless
of
the
blows
that
showered
upon
him
,
wrenching
his
*NL*
hands
tighter
and
tighter
in
the
garments
about
the
murderer
's
breast
,
*NL*
and
never
ceasing
to
call
for
help
with
all
his
might
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
contest
,
however
,
was
too
unequal
to
last
long
.
Sikes
had
him
*NL*
down
,
and
his
knee
was
on
his
throat
,
when
Crackit
pulled
him
back
with
*NL*
a
look
of
alarm
,
and
pointed
to
the
window
.
There
were
lights
gleaming
*NL*
below
,
voices
in
loud
and
earnest
conversation
,
the
tramp
of
hurried
*NL*
footsteps
--
endless
they
seemed
in
number
--
crossing
the
nearest
wooden
*NL*
bridge
.
One
man
on
horseback
seemed
to
be
among
the
crowd
;
for
there
*NL*
was
the
noise
of
hoofs
rattling
on
the
uneven
pavement
.
The
gleam
of
*NL*
lights
increased
;
the
footsteps
came
more
thickly
and
noisily
on
.
*NL*
Then
,
came
a
loud
knocking
at
the
door
,
and
then
a
hoarse
murmur
from
*NL*
such
a
multitude
of
angry
voices
as
would
have
made
the
boldest
quail
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Help
!
'
shrieked
the
boy
in
a
voice
that
rent
the
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
's
here
!
Break
down
the
door
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
In
the
King
's
name
,
'
cried
the
voices
without
;
and
the
hoarse
cry
*NL*
arose
again
,
but
louder
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Break
down
the
door
!
'
screamed
the
boy
.
'
I
tell
you
they
'll
never
*NL*
open
it
.
Run
straight
to
the
room
where
the
light
is
.
Break
down
the
*NL*
door
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Strokes
,
thick
and
heavy
,
rattled
upon
the
door
and
lower
*NL*
window-shutters
as
he
ceased
to
speak
,
and
a
loud
huzzah
burst
from
the
*NL*
crowd
;
giving
the
listener
,
for
the
first
time
,
some
adequate
idea
of
*NL*
its
immense
extent
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Open
the
door
of
some
place
where
I
can
lock
this
screeching
*NL*
Hell-babe
,
'
cried
Sikes
fiercely
;
running
to
and
fro
,
and
dragging
the
*NL*
boy
,
now
,
as
easily
as
if
he
were
an
empty
sack
.
`
That
door
.
Quick
!
'
*NL*
He
flung
him
in
,
bolted
it
,
and
turned
the
key
.
`
Is
the
downstairs
*NL*
door
fast
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Double-locked
and
chained
,
'
replied
Crackit
,
who
,
with
the
other
two
*NL*
men
,
still
remained
quite
helpless
and
bewildered
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
panels
--
are
they
strong
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Lined
with
sheet-iron
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
the
windows
too
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
and
the
windows
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Damn
you
!
'
cried
the
desperate
ruffian
,
throwing
up
the
sash
and
*NL*
menacing
the
crowd
.
`
Do
your
worst
!
I
'll
cheat
you
yet
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Of
all
the
terrific
yells
that
ever
fell
on
mortal
ears
,
none
could
*NL*
exceed
the
cry
of
the
infuriated
throng
.
Some
shouted
to
those
who
*NL*
were
nearest
to
set
the
house
on
fire
;
others
roared
to
the
officers
to
*NL*
shoot
him
dead
.
Among
them
all
,
none
showed
such
fury
as
the
man
on
*NL*
horseback
,
who
,
throwing
himself
out
of
the
saddle
,
and
bursting
*NL*
through
the
crowd
as
if
he
were
parting
water
,
cried
,
beneath
the
*NL*
window
,
in
a
voice
that
rose
above
all
others
,
`
Twenty
guineas
to
the
*NL*
man
who
brings
a
ladder
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
nearest
voices
took
up
the
cry
,
and
hundreds
echoed
it
.
Some
*NL*
called
for
ladders
,
some
for
sledge-hammers
;
some
ran
with
torches
to
*NL*
and
fro
as
if
to
seek
them
,
and
still
came
back
and
roared
again
;
some
*NL*
spent
their
breath
in
impotent
curses
and
execrations
;
some
pressed
*NL*
forward
with
the
ecstasy
of
madmen
,
and
thus
impeded
the
progress
of
*NL*
those
below
;
some
among
the
boldest
attempted
to
climb
up
by
the
*NL*
water-spout
and
crevices
in
the
wall
;
and
all
waved
to
and
fro
,
in
the
*NL*
darkness
beneath
,
like
a
field
of
corn
moved
by
an
angry
wind
:
and
*NL*
joined
from
time
to
time
in
one
loud
furious
roar
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
tide
,
'
cried
the
murderer
,
as
he
staggered
back
into
the
room
,
and
*NL*
shut
the
faces
out
,
`
the
tide
was
in
as
I
came
up
.
Give
me
a
rope
,
a
*NL*
long
rope
.
They
're
all
in
front
.
I
may
drop
into
the
Folly
Ditch
,
and
*NL*
clear
off
that
way
.
Give
me
a
rope
,
or
I
shall
do
three
more
murders
*NL*
and
kill
myself
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
panic-stricken
men
pointed
to
where
such
articles
were
kept
;
the
*NL*
murderer
,
hastily
selecting
the
longest
and
strongest
cord
,
hurried
up
*NL*
to
the
house-top
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
window
in
the
rear
of
the
house
had
been
long
ago
bricked
up
,
*NL*
except
one
small
trap
in
the
room
where
the
boy
was
locked
,
and
that
*NL*
was
too
small
even
for
the
passage
of
his
body
.
But
,
from
this
*NL*
aperture
,
he
had
never
ceased
to
call
on
those
without
,
to
guard
the
*NL*
back
;
and
thus
,
when
the
murderer
emerged
at
last
on
the
house-top
by
*NL*
the
door
in
the
roof
,
a
loud
shout
proclaimed
the
fact
to
those
in
*NL*
front
,
who
immediately
began
to
pour
round
,
pressing
upon
each
other
in
*NL*
an
unbroken
stream
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
planted
a
board
,
which
he
had
carried
up
with
him
for
the
purpose
,
*NL*
so
firmly
against
the
door
that
it
must
be
matter
of
great
difficulty
*NL*
to
open
it
from
the
inside
;
and
creeping
over
the
tiles
,
looked
over
*NL*
the
low
parapet
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
water
was
out
,
and
the
ditch
a
bed
of
mud
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
crowd
had
been
hushed
during
these
few
moments
,
watching
his
*NL*
motions
and
doubtful
of
his
purpose
,
but
the
instant
they
perceived
it
*NL*
and
knew
it
was
defeated
,
they
raised
a
cry
of
triumphant
execration
to
*NL*
which
all
their
previous
shouting
had
been
whispers
.
Again
and
again
*NL*
it
rose
.
Those
who
were
at
too
great
a
distance
to
know
its
meaning
,
*NL*
took
up
the
sound
;
it
echoed
and
re-echoed
;
it
seemed
as
though
the
*NL*
whole
city
had
poured
its
population
out
to
curse
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
pressed
the
people
from
the
front
--
on
,
on
,
on
,
in
a
strong
*NL*
struggling
current
of
angry
faces
,
with
here
and
there
a
glaring
torch
*NL*
to
lighten
them
up
,
and
show
them
out
in
all
their
wrath
and
passion
.
*NL*
The
houses
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
ditch
had
been
entered
by
the
*NL*
mob
;
sashes
were
thrown
up
,
or
torn
bodily
out
;
there
were
tiers
and
*NL*
tiers
of
faces
in
every
window
;
cluster
upon
cluster
of
people
clinging
*NL*
to
every
house-top
.
Each
little
bridge
-LRB-
and
there
were
three
in
sight
-RRB-
*NL*
bent
beneath
the
weight
of
the
crowd
upon
it
.
Still
the
current
poured
*NL*
on
to
find
some
nook
or
hole
from
which
to
vent
their
shouts
,
and
only
*NL*
for
an
instant
see
the
wretch
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
They
have
him
now
,
'
cried
a
man
on
the
nearest
bridge
.
`
Hurrah
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
crowd
grew
light
with
uncovered
heads
;
and
again
the
shout
uprose
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
will
give
fifty
pounds
,
'
cried
an
old
gentleman
from
the
same
*NL*
quarter
,
`
to
the
man
who
takes
him
alive
.
I
will
remain
here
,
till
he
*NL*
come
to
ask
me
for
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
another
roar
.
At
this
moment
the
word
was
passed
among
the
*NL*
crowd
that
the
door
was
forced
at
last
,
and
that
he
who
had
first
*NL*
called
for
the
ladder
had
mounted
into
the
room
.
The
stream
abruptly
*NL*
turned
,
as
this
intelligence
ran
from
mouth
to
mouth
;
and
the
people
at
*NL*
the
windows
,
seeing
those
upon
the
bridges
pouring
back
,
quitted
their
*NL*
stations
,
and
running
into
the
street
,
joined
the
concourse
that
now
*NL*
thronged
pell-mell
to
the
spot
they
had
left
:
each
man
crushing
and
*NL*
striving
with
his
neighbor
,
and
all
panting
with
impatience
to
get
near
*NL*
the
door
,
and
look
upon
the
criminal
as
the
officers
brought
him
out
.
*NL*
The
cries
and
shrieks
of
those
who
were
pressed
almost
to
suffocation
,
*NL*
or
trampled
down
and
trodden
under
foot
in
the
confusion
,
were
*NL*
dreadful
;
the
narrow
ways
were
completely
blocked
up
;
and
at
this
time
,
*NL*
between
the
rush
of
some
to
regain
the
space
in
front
of
the
house
,
and
*NL*
the
unavailing
struggles
of
others
to
extricate
themselves
from
the
*NL*
mass
,
the
immediate
attention
was
distracted
from
the
murderer
,
*NL*
although
the
universal
eagerness
for
his
capture
was
,
if
possible
,
*NL*
increased
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
had
shrunk
down
,
thoroughly
quelled
by
the
ferocity
of
the
*NL*
crowd
,
and
the
impossibility
of
escape
;
but
seeing
this
sudden
change
*NL*
with
no
less
rapidity
than
it
had
occurred
,
he
sprang
upon
his
feet
,
*NL*
determined
to
make
one
last
effort
for
his
life
by
dropping
into
the
*NL*
ditch
,
and
,
at
the
risk
of
being
stifled
,
endeavouring
to
creep
away
in
*NL*
the
darkness
and
confusion
.
*NL*
*NL*
Roused
into
new
strength
and
energy
,
and
stimulated
by
the
noise
within
*NL*
the
house
which
announced
that
an
entrance
had
really
been
effected
,
he
*NL*
set
his
foot
against
the
stack
of
chimneys
,
fastened
one
end
of
the
*NL*
rope
tightly
and
firmly
round
it
,
and
with
the
other
made
a
strong
*NL*
running
noose
by
the
aid
of
his
hands
and
teeth
almost
in
a
second
.
He
*NL*
could
let
himself
down
by
the
cord
to
within
a
less
distance
of
the
*NL*
ground
than
his
own
height
,
and
had
his
knife
ready
in
his
hand
to
cut
*NL*
it
then
and
drop
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
very
instant
when
he
brought
the
loop
over
his
head
previous
to
*NL*
slipping
it
beneath
his
arm-pits
,
and
when
the
old
gentleman
*NL*
before-mentioned
-LRB-
who
had
clung
so
tight
to
the
railing
of
the
bridge
*NL*
as
to
resist
the
force
of
the
crowd
,
and
retain
his
position
-RRB-
earnestly
*NL*
warned
those
about
him
that
the
man
was
about
to
lower
himself
down
--
at
*NL*
that
very
instant
the
murderer
,
looking
behind
him
on
the
roof
,
threw
*NL*
his
arms
above
his
head
,
and
uttered
a
yell
of
terror
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
eyes
again
!
'
he
cried
in
an
unearthly
screech
.
*NL*
*NL*
Staggering
as
if
struck
by
lightning
,
he
lost
his
balance
and
tumbled
*NL*
over
the
parapet
.
The
noose
was
on
his
neck
.
It
ran
up
with
his
*NL*
weight
,
tight
as
a
bow-string
,
and
swift
as
the
arrow
it
speeds
.
He
*NL*
fell
for
five-and-thirty
feet
.
There
was
a
sudden
jerk
,
a
terrific
*NL*
convulsion
of
the
limbs
;
and
there
he
hung
,
with
the
open
knife
*NL*
clenched
in
his
stiffening
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
chimney
quivered
with
the
shock
,
but
stood
it
bravely
.
The
*NL*
murderer
swung
lifeless
against
the
wall
;
and
the
boy
,
thrusting
aside
*NL*
the
dangling
body
which
obscured
his
view
,
called
to
the
people
to
come
*NL*
and
take
him
out
,
for
God
's
sake
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
dog
,
which
had
lain
concealed
till
now
,
ran
backwards
and
forwards
on
*NL*
the
parapet
with
a
dismal
howl
,
and
collecting
himself
for
a
spring
,
*NL*
jumped
for
the
dead
man
's
shoulders
.
Missing
his
aim
,
he
fell
into
the
*NL*
ditch
,
turning
completely
over
as
he
went
;
and
striking
his
head
*NL*
against
a
stone
,
dashed
out
his
brains
.

CHAPTER
LI
*NL*
*NL*
AFFORDING
AN
EXPLANATION
OF
MORE
MYSTERIES
THAN
ONE
,
AND
COMPREHENDING
*NL*
A
PROPOSAL
OF
MARRIAGE
WITH
NO
WORD
OF
SETTLEMENT
OR
PIN-MONEY
*NL*
*NL*
The
events
narrated
in
the
last
chapter
were
yet
but
two
days
old
,
when
*NL*
Oliver
found
himself
,
at
three
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
,
in
a
*NL*
travelling-carriage
rolling
fast
towards
his
native
town
.
Mrs.
Maylie
,
*NL*
and
Rose
,
and
Mrs.
Bedwin
,
and
the
good
doctor
were
with
him
:
and
Mr.
*NL*
Brownlow
followed
in
a
post-chaise
,
accompanied
by
one
other
person
*NL*
whose
name
had
not
been
mentioned
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
not
talked
much
upon
the
way
;
for
Oliver
was
in
a
flutter
of
*NL*
agitation
and
uncertainty
which
deprived
him
of
the
power
of
collecting
*NL*
his
thoughts
,
and
almost
of
speech
,
and
appeared
to
have
scarcely
less
*NL*
effect
on
his
companions
,
who
shared
it
,
in
at
least
an
equal
degree
.
*NL*
He
and
the
two
ladies
had
been
very
carefully
made
acquainted
by
Mr.
*NL*
Brownlow
with
the
nature
of
the
admissions
which
had
been
forced
from
*NL*
Monks
;
and
although
they
knew
that
the
object
of
their
present
journey
*NL*
was
to
complete
the
work
which
had
been
so
well
begun
,
still
the
whole
*NL*
matter
was
enveloped
in
enough
of
doubt
and
mystery
to
leave
them
in
*NL*
endurance
of
the
most
intense
suspense
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
same
kind
friend
had
,
with
Mr.
Losberne
's
assistance
,
cautiously
*NL*
stopped
all
channels
of
communication
through
which
they
could
receive
*NL*
intelligence
of
the
dreadful
occurrences
that
so
recently
taken
place
.
*NL*
`
It
was
quite
true
,
'
he
said
,
`
that
they
must
know
them
before
long
,
*NL*
but
it
might
be
at
a
better
time
than
the
present
,
and
it
could
not
be
*NL*
at
a
worse
.
'
So
,
they
travelled
on
in
silence
:
each
busied
with
*NL*
reflections
on
the
object
which
had
brought
them
together
:
and
no
one
*NL*
disposed
to
give
utterance
to
the
thoughts
which
crowded
upon
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
if
Oliver
,
under
these
influences
,
had
remained
silent
while
they
*NL*
journeyed
towards
his
birth-place
by
a
road
he
had
never
seen
,
how
the
*NL*
whole
current
of
his
recollections
ran
back
to
old
times
,
and
what
a
*NL*
crowd
of
emotions
were
wakened
up
in
his
breast
,
when
they
turned
into
*NL*
that
which
he
had
traversed
on
foot
:
a
poor
houseless
,
wandering
boy
,
*NL*
without
a
friend
to
help
him
,
or
a
roof
to
shelter
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
See
there
,
there
!
'
cried
Oliver
,
eagerly
clasping
the
hand
of
Rose
,
*NL*
and
pointing
out
at
the
carriage
window
;
`
that
's
the
stile
I
came
over
;
*NL*
there
are
the
hedges
I
crept
behind
,
for
fear
any
one
should
overtake
*NL*
me
and
force
me
back
!
Yonder
is
the
path
across
the
fields
,
leading
to
*NL*
the
old
house
where
I
was
a
little
child
!
Oh
Dick
,
Dick
,
my
dear
old
*NL*
friend
,
if
I
could
only
see
you
now
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
will
see
him
soon
,
'
replied
Rose
,
gently
taking
his
folded
hands
*NL*
between
her
own
.
`
You
shall
tell
him
how
happy
you
are
,
and
how
rich
*NL*
you
have
grown
,
and
that
in
all
your
happiness
you
have
none
so
great
*NL*
as
the
coming
back
to
make
him
happy
too
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
yes
,
'
said
Oliver
,
`
and
we
'll
--
we
'll
take
him
away
from
here
,
and
*NL*
have
him
clothed
and
taught
,
and
send
him
to
some
quiet
country
place
*NL*
where
he
may
grow
strong
and
well
,
--
shall
we
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
Rose
nodded
`
yes
,
'
for
the
boy
was
smiling
through
such
happy
tears
*NL*
that
she
could
not
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
will
be
kind
and
good
to
him
,
for
you
are
to
every
one
,
'
said
*NL*
Oliver
.
`
It
will
make
you
cry
,
I
know
,
to
hear
what
he
can
tell
;
but
*NL*
never
mind
,
never
mind
,
it
will
be
all
over
,
and
you
will
smile
*NL*
again
--
I
know
that
too
--
to
think
how
changed
he
is
;
you
did
the
same
*NL*
with
me
.
He
said
``
God
bless
you
''
to
me
when
I
ran
away
,
'
cried
the
boy
*NL*
with
a
burst
of
affectionate
emotion
;
`
and
I
will
say
``
God
bless
you
''
*NL*
now
,
and
show
him
how
I
love
him
for
it
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
approached
the
town
,
and
at
length
drove
through
its
narrow
*NL*
streets
,
it
became
matter
of
no
small
difficulty
to
restrain
the
boy
*NL*
within
reasonable
bounds
.
There
was
Sowerberry
's
the
undertaker
's
just
*NL*
as
it
used
to
be
,
only
smaller
and
less
imposing
in
appearance
than
he
*NL*
remembered
it
--
there
were
all
the
well-known
shops
and
houses
,
with
*NL*
almost
every
one
of
which
he
had
some
slight
incident
connected
--
there
*NL*
was
Gamfield
's
cart
,
the
very
cart
he
used
to
have
,
standing
at
the
old
*NL*
public-house
door
--
there
was
the
workhouse
,
the
dreary
prison
of
his
*NL*
youthful
days
,
with
its
dismal
windows
frowning
on
the
street
--
there
*NL*
was
the
same
lean
porter
standing
at
the
gate
,
at
sight
of
whom
Oliver
*NL*
involuntarily
shrunk
back
,
and
then
laughed
at
himself
for
being
so
*NL*
foolish
,
then
cried
,
then
laughed
again
--
there
were
scores
of
faces
at
*NL*
the
doors
and
windows
that
he
knew
quite
well
--
there
was
nearly
*NL*
everything
as
if
he
had
left
it
but
yesterday
,
and
all
his
recent
life
*NL*
had
been
but
a
happy
dream
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
was
pure
,
earnest
,
joyful
reality
.
They
drove
straight
to
the
*NL*
door
of
the
chief
hotel
-LRB-
which
Oliver
used
to
stare
up
at
,
with
awe
,
*NL*
and
think
a
mighty
palace
,
but
which
had
somehow
fallen
off
in
grandeur
*NL*
and
size
-RRB-
;
and
here
was
Mr.
Grimwig
all
ready
to
receive
them
,
kissing
*NL*
the
young
lady
,
and
the
old
one
too
,
when
they
got
out
of
the
coach
,
as
*NL*
if
he
were
the
grandfather
of
the
whole
party
,
all
smiles
and
kindness
,
*NL*
and
not
offering
to
eat
his
head
--
no
,
not
once
;
not
even
when
he
*NL*
contradicted
a
very
old
postboy
about
the
nearest
road
to
London
,
and
*NL*
maintained
he
knew
it
best
,
though
he
had
only
come
that
way
once
,
and
*NL*
that
time
fast
asleep
.
There
was
dinner
prepared
,
and
there
were
*NL*
bedrooms
ready
,
and
everything
was
arranged
as
if
by
magic
.
*NL*
*NL*
Notwithstanding
all
this
,
when
the
hurry
of
the
first
half-hour
was
*NL*
over
,
the
same
silence
and
constraint
prevailed
that
had
marked
their
*NL*
journey
down
.
Mr.
Brownlow
did
not
join
them
at
dinner
,
but
remained
*NL*
in
a
separate
room
.
The
two
other
gentlemen
hurried
in
and
out
with
*NL*
anxious
faces
,
and
,
during
the
short
intervals
when
they
were
present
,
*NL*
conversed
apart
.
Once
,
Mrs.
Maylie
was
called
away
,
and
after
being
*NL*
absent
for
nearly
an
hour
,
returned
with
eyes
swollen
with
weeping
.
*NL*
All
these
things
made
Rose
and
Oliver
,
who
were
not
in
any
new
secrets
,
*NL*
nervous
and
uncomfortable
.
They
sat
wondering
,
in
silence
;
or
,
if
they
*NL*
exchanged
a
few
words
,
spoke
in
whispers
,
as
if
they
were
afraid
to
*NL*
hear
the
sound
of
their
own
voices
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
,
when
nine
o'clock
had
come
,
and
they
began
to
think
they
*NL*
were
to
hear
no
more
that
night
,
Mr.
Losberne
and
Mr.
Grimwig
entered
*NL*
the
room
,
followed
by
Mr.
Brownlow
and
a
man
whom
Oliver
almost
*NL*
shrieked
with
surprise
to
see
;
for
they
told
him
it
was
his
brother
,
*NL*
and
it
was
the
same
man
he
had
met
at
the
market-town
,
and
seen
looking
*NL*
in
with
Fagin
at
the
window
of
his
little
room
.
Monks
cast
a
look
of
*NL*
hate
,
which
,
even
then
,
he
could
not
dissemble
,
at
the
astonished
boy
,
*NL*
and
sat
down
near
the
door
.
Mr.
Brownlow
,
who
had
papers
in
his
hand
,
*NL*
walked
to
a
table
near
which
Rose
and
Oliver
were
seated
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
This
is
a
painful
task
,
'
said
he
,
`
but
these
declarations
,
which
have
*NL*
been
signed
in
London
before
many
gentlemen
,
must
be
in
substance
*NL*
repeated
here
.
I
would
have
spared
you
the
degradation
,
but
we
must
*NL*
hear
them
from
your
own
lips
before
we
part
,
and
you
know
why
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Go
on
,
'
said
the
person
addressed
,
turning
away
his
face
.
`
Quick
.
I
*NL*
have
almost
done
enough
,
I
think
.
Do
n't
keep
me
here
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
This
child
,
'
said
Mr.
Brownlow
,
drawing
Oliver
to
him
,
and
laying
his
*NL*
hand
upon
his
head
,
`
is
your
half-brother
;
the
illegitimate
son
of
your
*NL*
father
,
my
dear
friend
Edwin
Leeford
,
by
poor
young
Agnes
Fleming
,
who
*NL*
died
in
giving
him
birth
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
'
said
Monks
,
scowling
at
the
trembling
boy
:
the
beating
of
whose
*NL*
heart
he
might
have
heard
.
`
That
is
the
bastard
child
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
term
you
use
,
'
said
Mr.
Brownlow
,
sternly
,
`
is
a
reproach
to
those
*NL*
long
since
passed
beyond
the
feeble
censure
of
the
world
.
It
reflects
*NL*
disgrace
on
no
one
living
,
except
you
who
use
it
.
Let
that
pass
.
He
*NL*
was
born
in
this
town
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
In
the
workhouse
of
this
town
,
'
was
the
sullen
reply
.
`
You
have
the
*NL*
story
there
.
'
He
pointed
impatiently
to
the
papers
as
he
spoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
must
have
it
here
,
too
,
'
said
Mr.
Brownlow
,
looking
round
upon
the
*NL*
listeners
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Listen
then
!
You
!
'
returned
Monks
.
`
His
father
being
taken
ill
at
*NL*
Rome
,
was
joined
by
his
wife
,
my
mother
,
from
whom
he
had
been
long
*NL*
separated
,
who
went
from
Paris
and
took
me
with
her
--
to
look
after
his
*NL*
property
,
for
what
I
know
,
for
she
had
no
great
affection
for
him
,
nor
*NL*
he
for
her
.
He
knew
nothing
of
us
,
for
his
senses
were
gone
,
and
he
*NL*
slumbered
on
till
next
day
,
when
he
died
.
Among
the
papers
in
his
*NL*
desk
,
were
two
,
dated
on
the
night
his
illness
first
came
on
,
directed
*NL*
to
yourself
'
;
he
addressed
himself
to
Mr.
Brownlow
;
`
and
enclosed
in
a
*NL*
few
short
lines
to
you
,
with
an
intimation
on
the
cover
of
the
package
*NL*
that
it
was
not
to
be
forwarded
till
after
he
was
dead
.
One
of
these
*NL*
papers
was
a
letter
to
this
girl
Agnes
;
the
other
a
will
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
of
the
letter
?
'
asked
Mr.
Brownlow
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
letter
?
--
A
sheet
of
paper
crossed
and
crossed
again
,
with
a
*NL*
penitent
confession
,
and
prayers
to
God
to
help
her
.
He
had
palmed
a
*NL*
tale
on
the
girl
that
some
secret
mystery
--
to
be
explained
one
*NL*
day
--
prevented
his
marrying
her
just
then
;
and
so
she
had
gone
on
,
*NL*
trusting
patiently
to
him
,
until
she
trusted
too
far
,
and
lost
what
*NL*
none
could
ever
give
her
back
.
She
was
,
at
that
time
,
within
a
few
*NL*
months
of
her
confinement
.
He
told
her
all
he
had
meant
to
do
,
to
hide
*NL*
her
shame
,
if
he
had
lived
,
and
prayed
her
,
if
he
died
,
not
to
curse
*NL*
his
memory
,
or
think
the
consequences
of
their
sin
would
be
visited
on
*NL*
her
or
their
young
child
;
for
all
the
guilt
was
his
.
He
reminded
her
*NL*
of
the
day
he
had
given
her
the
little
locket
and
the
ring
with
her
*NL*
christian
name
engraved
upon
it
,
and
a
blank
left
for
that
which
he
*NL*
hoped
one
day
to
have
bestowed
upon
her
--
prayed
her
yet
to
keep
it
,
and
*NL*
wear
it
next
her
heart
,
as
she
had
done
before
--
and
then
ran
on
,
*NL*
wildly
,
in
the
same
words
,
over
and
over
again
,
as
if
he
had
gone
*NL*
distracted
.
I
believe
he
had
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
will
,
'
said
Mr.
Brownlow
,
as
Oliver
's
tears
fell
fast
.
*NL*
*NL*
Monks
was
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
will
,
'
said
Mr.
Brownlow
,
speaking
for
him
,
`
was
in
the
same
*NL*
spirit
as
the
letter
.
He
talked
of
miseries
which
his
wife
had
brought
*NL*
upon
him
;
of
the
rebellious
disposition
,
vice
,
malice
,
and
premature
*NL*
bad
passions
of
you
his
only
son
,
who
had
been
trained
to
hate
him
;
and
*NL*
left
you
,
and
your
mother
,
each
an
annuity
of
eight
hundred
pounds
.
*NL*
The
bulk
of
his
property
he
divided
into
two
equal
portions
--
one
for
*NL*
Agnes
Fleming
,
and
the
other
for
their
child
,
if
it
should
be
born
*NL*
alive
,
and
ever
come
of
age
.
If
it
were
a
girl
,
it
was
to
inherit
the
*NL*
money
unconditionally
;
but
if
a
boy
,
only
on
the
stipulation
that
in
*NL*
his
minority
he
should
never
have
stained
his
name
with
any
public
act
*NL*
of
dishonour
,
meanness
,
cowardice
,
or
wrong
.
He
did
this
,
he
said
,
to
*NL*
mark
his
confidence
in
the
other
,
and
his
conviction
--
only
strengthened
*NL*
by
approaching
death
--
that
the
child
would
share
her
gentle
heart
,
and
*NL*
noble
nature
.
If
he
were
disappointed
in
this
expectation
,
then
the
*NL*
money
was
to
come
to
you
:
for
then
,
and
not
till
then
,
when
both
*NL*
children
were
equal
,
would
he
recognise
your
prior
claim
upon
his
*NL*
purse
,
who
had
none
upon
his
heart
,
but
had
,
from
an
infant
,
repulsed
*NL*
him
with
coldness
and
aversion
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
My
mother
,
'
said
Monks
,
in
a
louder
tone
,
`
did
what
a
woman
should
*NL*
have
done
.
She
burnt
this
will
.
The
letter
never
reached
its
*NL*
destination
;
but
that
,
and
other
proofs
,
she
kept
,
in
case
they
ever
*NL*
tried
to
lie
away
the
blot
.
The
girl
's
father
had
the
truth
from
her
*NL*
with
every
aggravation
that
her
violent
hate
--
I
love
her
for
it
*NL*
now
--
could
add
.
Goaded
by
shame
and
dishonour
he
fled
with
his
*NL*
children
into
a
remote
corner
of
Wales
,
changing
his
very
name
that
his
*NL*
friends
might
never
know
of
his
retreat
;
and
here
,
no
great
while
*NL*
afterwards
,
he
was
found
dead
in
his
bed
.
The
girl
had
left
her
home
,
*NL*
in
secret
,
some
weeks
before
;
he
had
searched
for
her
,
on
foot
,
in
*NL*
every
town
and
village
near
;
it
was
on
the
night
when
he
returned
home
,
*NL*
assured
that
she
had
destroyed
herself
,
to
hide
her
shame
and
his
,
that
*NL*
his
old
heart
broke
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
short
silence
here
,
until
Mr.
Brownlow
took
up
the
thread
*NL*
of
the
narrative
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Years
after
this
,
'
he
said
,
`
this
man
's
--
Edward
Leeford
's
--
mother
came
*NL*
to
me
.
He
had
left
her
,
when
only
eighteen
;
robbed
her
of
jewels
and
*NL*
money
;
gambled
,
squandered
,
forged
,
and
fled
to
London
:
where
for
two
*NL*
years
he
had
associated
with
the
lowest
outcasts
.
She
was
sinking
*NL*
under
a
painful
and
incurable
disease
,
and
wished
to
recover
him
before
*NL*
she
died
.
Inquiries
were
set
on
foot
,
and
strict
searches
made
.
They
*NL*
were
unavailing
for
a
long
time
,
but
ultimately
successful
;
and
he
went
*NL*
back
with
her
to
France
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
There
she
died
,
'
said
Monks
,
`
after
a
lingering
illness
;
and
,
on
her
*NL*
death-bed
,
she
bequeathed
these
secrets
to
me
,
together
with
her
*NL*
unquenchable
and
deadly
hatred
of
all
whom
they
involved
--
though
she
*NL*
need
not
have
left
me
that
,
for
I
had
inherited
it
long
before
.
She
*NL*
would
not
believe
that
the
girl
had
destroyed
herself
,
and
the
child
*NL*
too
,
but
was
filled
with
the
impression
that
a
male
child
had
been
*NL*
born
,
and
was
alive
.
I
swore
to
her
,
if
ever
it
crossed
my
path
,
to
*NL*
hunt
it
down
;
never
to
let
it
rest
;
to
pursue
it
with
the
bitterest
and
*NL*
most
unrelenting
animosity
;
to
vent
upon
it
the
hatred
that
I
deeply
*NL*
felt
,
and
to
spit
upon
the
empty
vaunt
of
that
insulting
will
by
*NL*
draggin
it
,
if
I
could
,
to
the
very
gallows-foot
.
She
was
right
.
He
*NL*
came
in
my
way
at
last
.
I
began
well
;
and
,
but
for
babbling
drabs
,
I
*NL*
would
have
finished
as
I
began
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
villain
folded
his
arms
tight
together
,
and
muttered
curses
on
*NL*
himself
in
the
impotence
of
baffled
malice
,
Mr.
Brownlow
turned
to
the
*NL*
terrified
group
beside
him
,
and
explained
that
the
Jew
,
who
had
been
*NL*
his
old
accomplice
and
confidant
,
had
a
large
reward
for
keeping
Oliver
*NL*
ensnared
:
of
which
some
part
was
to
be
given
up
,
in
the
event
of
his
*NL*
being
rescued
:
and
that
a
dispute
on
this
head
had
led
to
their
visit
*NL*
to
the
country
house
for
the
purpose
of
identifying
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
locket
and
ring
?
'
said
Mr.
Brownlow
,
turning
to
Monks
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
bought
them
from
the
man
and
woman
I
told
you
of
,
who
stole
them
*NL*
from
the
nurse
,
who
stole
them
from
the
corpse
,
'
answered
Monks
without
*NL*
raising
his
eyes
.
`
You
know
what
became
of
them
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Brownlow
merely
nodded
to
Mr.
Grimwig
,
who
disappearing
with
great
*NL*
alacrity
,
shortly
returned
,
pushing
in
Mrs.
Bumble
,
and
dragging
her
*NL*
unwilling
consort
after
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Do
my
hi
's
deceive
me
!
'
cried
Mr.
Bumble
,
with
ill-feigned
enthusiasm
,
*NL*
`
or
is
that
little
Oliver
?
Oh
O-li-ver
,
if
you
know
'd
how
I
've
been
*NL*
a-grieving
for
you
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Hold
your
tongue
,
fool
,
'
murmured
Mrs.
Bumble
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Is
n't
natur
,
natur
,
Mrs.
Bumble
?
'
remonstrated
the
workhouse
master
.
*NL*
`
Ca
n't
I
be
supposed
to
feel
--
_
I
_
as
brought
him
up
porochially
--
when
I
*NL*
see
him
a-setting
here
among
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
very
affablest
*NL*
description
!
I
always
loved
that
boy
as
if
he
'd
been
my
--
my
--
my
own
*NL*
grandfather
,
'
said
Mr.
Bumble
,
halting
for
an
appropriate
comparison
.
*NL*
`
Master
Oliver
,
my
dear
,
you
remember
the
blessed
gentleman
in
the
*NL*
white
waistcoat
?
Ah
!
he
went
to
heaven
last
week
,
in
a
oak
coffin
with
*NL*
plated
handles
,
Oliver
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Come
,
sir
,
'
said
Mr.
Grimwig
,
tartly
;
`
suppress
your
feelings
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
will
do
my
endeavours
,
sir
,
'
replied
Mr.
Bumble
.
`
How
do
you
do
,
*NL*
sir
?
I
hope
you
are
very
well
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
This
salutation
was
addressed
to
Mr.
Brownlow
,
who
had
stepped
up
to
*NL*
within
a
short
distance
of
the
respectable
couple
.
He
inquired
,
as
he
*NL*
pointed
to
Monks
,
*NL*
*NL*
`
Do
you
know
that
person
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
'
replied
Mrs.
Bumble
flatly
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Perhaps
_
you
_
do
n't
?
'
said
Mr.
Brownlow
,
addressing
her
spouse
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
never
saw
him
in
all
my
life
,
'
said
Mr.
Bumble
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Nor
sold
him
anything
,
perhaps
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
'
replied
Mrs.
Bumble
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
never
had
,
perhaps
,
a
certain
gold
locket
and
ring
?
'
said
Mr.
*NL*
Brownlow
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Certainly
not
,
'
replied
the
matron
.
`
Why
are
we
brought
here
to
*NL*
answer
to
such
nonsense
as
this
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
Again
Mr.
Brownlow
nodded
to
Mr.
Grimwig
;
and
again
that
gentleman
*NL*
limped
away
with
extraordinary
readiness
.
But
not
again
did
he
return
*NL*
with
a
stout
man
and
wife
;
for
this
time
,
he
led
in
two
palsied
women
,
*NL*
who
shook
and
tottered
as
they
walked
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
shut
the
door
the
night
old
Sally
died
,
'
said
the
foremost
one
,
*NL*
raising
her
shrivelled
hand
,
`
but
you
could
n't
shut
out
the
sound
,
nor
*NL*
stop
the
chinks
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
no
,
'
said
the
other
,
looking
round
her
and
wagging
her
toothless
*NL*
jaws
.
`
No
,
no
,
no
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
We
heard
her
try
to
tell
you
what
she
'd
done
,
and
saw
you
take
a
paper
*NL*
from
her
hand
,
and
watched
you
too
,
next
day
,
to
the
pawnbroker
's
*NL*
shop
,
'
said
the
first
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
'
added
the
second
,
`
and
it
was
a
``
locket
and
gold
ring
.
''
We
found
*NL*
out
that
,
and
saw
it
given
you
.
We
were
by
.
Oh
!
we
were
by
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
we
know
more
than
that
,
'
resumed
the
first
,
`
for
she
told
us
*NL*
often
,
long
ago
,
that
the
young
mother
had
told
her
that
,
feeling
she
*NL*
should
never
get
over
it
,
she
was
on
her
way
,
at
the
time
that
she
was
*NL*
taken
ill
,
to
die
near
the
grave
of
the
father
of
the
child
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Would
you
like
to
see
the
pawnbroker
himself
?
'
asked
Mr.
Grimwig
with
*NL*
a
motion
towards
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
'
replied
the
woman
;
`
if
he
--
she
pointed
to
Monks
--
`
has
been
coward
*NL*
enough
to
confess
,
as
I
see
he
has
,
and
you
have
sounded
all
these
hags
*NL*
till
you
have
found
the
right
ones
,
I
have
nothing
more
to
say
.
I
*NL*
_
did
_
sell
them
,
and
they
're
where
you
'll
never
get
them
.
What
then
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Nothing
,
'
replied
Mr.
Brownlow
,
`
except
that
it
remains
for
us
to
take
*NL*
care
that
neither
of
you
is
employed
in
a
situation
of
trust
again
.
*NL*
You
may
leave
the
room
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
hope
,
'
said
Mr.
Bumble
,
looking
about
him
with
great
ruefulness
,
as
*NL*
Mr.
Grimwig
disappeared
with
the
two
old
women
:
'
I
hope
that
this
*NL*
unfortunate
little
circumstance
will
not
deprive
me
of
my

*NL*
*NL*
`
Indeed
it
will
,
'
replied
Mr.
Brownlow
.
`
You
may
make
up
your
mind
to
*NL*
that
,
and
think
yourself
well
off
besides
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
was
all
Mrs.
Bumble
.
She
_
would
_
do
it
,
'
urged
Mr.
Bumble
;
first
*NL*
looking
round
to
ascertain
that
his
partner
had
left
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
is
no
excuse
,
'
replied
Mr.
Brownlow
.
`
You
were
present
on
the
*NL*
occasion
of
the
destruction
of
these
trinkets
,
and
indeed
are
the
more
*NL*
guilty
of
the
two
,
in
the
eye
of
the
law
;
for
the
law
supposes
that
*NL*
your
wife
acts
under
your
direction
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
If
the
law
supposes
that
,
'
said
Mr.
Bumble
,
squeezing
his
hat
*NL*
emphatically
in
both
hands
,
`
the
law
is
a
ass
--
a
idiot
.
If
that
's
the
*NL*
eye
of
the
law
,
the
law
is
a
bachelor
;
and
the
worst
I
wish
the
law
is
,
*NL*
that
his
eye
may
be
opened
by
experience
--
by
experience
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Laying
great
stress
on
the
repetition
of
these
two
words
,
Mr.
Bumble
*NL*
fixed
his
hat
on
very
tight
,
and
putting
his
hands
in
his
pockets
,
*NL*
followed
his
helpmate
downstairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Young
lady
,
'
said
Mr.
Brownlow
,
turning
to
Rose
,
`
give
me
your
hand
.
*NL*
Do
not
tremble
.
You
need
not
fear
to
hear
the
few
remaining
words
we
*NL*
have
to
say
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
If
they
have
--
I
do
not
know
how
they
can
,
but
if
they
have
--
any
*NL*
reference
to
me
,
'
said
Rose
,
`
pray
let
me
hear
them
at
some
other
time
.
*NL*
I
have
not
strength
or
spirits
now
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Nay
,
'
returned
the
old
gentlman
,
drawing
her
arm
through
his
;
`
you
*NL*
have
more
fortitude
than
this
,
I
am
sure
.
Do
you
know
this
young
lady
,
*NL*
sir
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
'
replied
Monks
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
never
saw
you
before
,
'
said
Rose
faintly
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
have
seen
you
often
,
'
returned
Monks
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
father
of
the
unhappy
Agnes
had
_
two
_
daughters
,
'
said
Mr.
*NL*
Brownlow
.
`
What
was
the
fate
of
the
other
--
the
child
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
child
,
'
replied
Monks
,
`
when
her
father
died
in
a
strange
place
,
*NL*
in
a
strange
name
,
without
a
letter
,
book
,
or
scrap
of
paper
that
*NL*
yielded
the
faintest
clue
by
which
his
friends
or
relatives
could
be
*NL*
traced
--
the
child
was
taken
by
some
wretched
cottagers
,
who
reared
it
*NL*
as
their
own
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Go
on
,
'
said
Mr.
Brownlow
,
signing
to
Mrs.
Maylie
to
approach
.
`
Go
on
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
could
n't
find
the
spot
to
which
these
people
had
repaired
,
'
said
*NL*
Monks
,
`
but
where
friendship
fails
,
hatred
will
often
force
a
way
.
My
*NL*
mother
found
it
,
after
a
year
of
cunning
search
--
ay
,
and
found
the
*NL*
child
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
She
took
it
,
did
she
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
.
The
people
were
poor
and
began
to
sicken
--
at
least
the
man
*NL*
did
--
of
their
fine
humanity
;
so
she
left
it
with
them
,
giving
them
a
*NL*
small
present
of
money
which
would
not
last
long
,
and
promised
more
,
*NL*
which
she
never
meant
to
send
.
She
did
n't
quite
rely
,
however
,
on
*NL*
their
discontent
and
poverty
for
the
child
's
unhappiness
,
but
told
the
*NL*
history
of
the
sister
's
shame
,
with
such
alterations
as
suited
her
;
*NL*
bade
them
take
good
heed
of
the
child
,
for
she
came
of
bad
blood
;
and
*NL*
told
them
she
was
illegitimate
,
and
sure
to
go
wrong
at
one
time
or
*NL*
other
.
The
circumstances
countenanced
all
this
;
the
people
believed
*NL*
it
;
and
there
the
child
dragged
on
an
existence
,
miserable
enough
even
*NL*
to
satisfy
us
,
until
a
widow
lady
,
residing
,
then
,
at
Chester
,
saw
the
*NL*
girl
by
chance
,
pitied
her
,
and
took
her
home
.
There
was
some
cursed
*NL*
spell
,
I
think
,
against
us
;
for
in
spite
of
all
our
efforts
she
*NL*
remained
there
and
was
happy
.
I
lost
sight
of
her
,
two
or
three
years
*NL*
ago
,
and
saw
her
no
more
until
a
few
months
back
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Do
you
see
her
now
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
.
Leaning
on
your
arm
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
not
the
less
my
niece
,
'
cried
Mrs.
Maylie
,
folding
the
fainting
*NL*
girl
in
her
arms
;
`
not
the
less
my
dearest
child
.
I
would
not
lose
her
*NL*
now
,
for
all
the
treasures
of
the
world
.
My
sweet
companion
,
my
own
*NL*
dear
girl
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
only
friend
I
ever
had
,
'
cried
Rose
,
clinging
to
her
.
`
The
*NL*
kindest
,
best
of
friends
.
My
heart
will
burst
.
I
can
not
bear
all
*NL*
this
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
have
borne
more
,
and
have
been
,
through
all
,
the
best
and
gentlest
*NL*
creature
that
ever
shed
happiness
on
every
one
she
knew
,
'
said
Mrs.
*NL*
Maylie
,
embracing
her
tenderly
.
`
Come
,
come
,
my
love
,
remember
who
this
*NL*
is
who
waits
to
clasp
you
in
his
arms

poor
child
!
See
here
--
look

*NL*

,
my
dear
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Not
aunt
,
'
cried
Oliver
,
throwing
his
arms
about
her
neck
;
`
I
'll
never
*NL*
call
her
aunt
--
sister
,
my
own
dear
sister
,
that
something
taught
my
*NL*
heart
to
love
so
dearly
from
the
first
!
Rose
,
dear
,
darling
Rose
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Let
the
tears
which
fell
,
and
the
broken
words
which
were
exchanged
in
*NL*
the
long
close
embrace
between
the
orphans
,
be
sacred
.
A
father
,
*NL*
sister
,
and
mother
,
were
gained
,
and
lost
,
in
that
one
moment
.
Joy
and
*NL*
grief
were
mingled
in
the
cup
;
but
there
were
no
bitter
tears
:
for
*NL*
even
grief
itself
arose
so
softened
,
and
clothed
in
such
sweet
and
*NL*
tender
recollections
,
that
it
became
a
solemn
pleasure
,
and
lost
all
*NL*
character
of
pain
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
a
long
,
long
time
alone
.
A
soft
tap
at
the
door
,
at
length
*NL*
announced
that
some
one
was
without
.
Oliver
opened
it
,
glided
away
,
*NL*
and
gave
place
to
Harry
Maylie
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
know
it
all
,
'
he
said
,
taking
a
seat
beside
the
lovely
girl
.
`
Dear
*NL*
Rose
,
I
know
it
all
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
am
not
here
by
accident
,
'
he
added
after
a
lengthened
silence
;
`
nor
*NL*
have
I
heard
all
this
to-night
,
for
I
knew
it
yesterday
--
only
*NL*
yesterday
.
Do
you
guess
that
I
have
come
to
remind
you
of
a
promise
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Stay
,
'
said
Rose
.
`
You
_
do
_
know
all
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
All
.
You
gave
me
leave
,
at
any
time
within
a
year
,
to
renew
the
*NL*
subject
of
our
last
discourse
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
did
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Not
to
press
you
to
alter
your
determination
,
'
pursued
the
young
man
,
*NL*
`
but
to
hear
you
repeat
it
,
if
you
would
.
I
was
to
lay
whatever
of
*NL*
station
or
fortune
I
might
possess
at
your
feet
,
and
if
you
still
*NL*
adhered
to
your
former
determination
,
I
pledged
myself
,
by
no
word
or
*NL*
act
,
to
seek
to
change
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
same
reasons
which
influenced
me
then
,
will
influence
me
now
,
'
*NL*
said
Rose
firmly
.
`
If
I
ever
owed
a
strict
and
rigid
duty
to
her
,
*NL*
whose
goodness
saved
me
from
a
life
of
indigence
and
suffering
,
when
*NL*
should
I
ever
feel
it
,
as
I
should
to-night
?
It
is
a
struggle
,
'
said
*NL*
Rose
,
`
but
one
I
am
proud
to
make
;
it
is
a
pang
,
but
one
my
heart
shall
*NL*
bear
.

*NL*

The
disclosure

to-night

--
Harry
began
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
disclosure
of
to-night
,
'
replied
Rose
softly
,
`
leaves
me
in
the
*NL*
same
position
,
with
reference
to
you
,
as
that
in
which
I
stood
before

'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
harden
your
heart
against

Rose
,
'
urged
her
lover
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
Harry
,
Harry
,
'
said
the
young
lady
,
bursting
into
tears
;
'
I
wish
I
*NL*
could
,
and
spare
myself
this
pain
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Then
why
inflict
it
on
yourself
?
'
said
Harry
,
taking
her
hand
.
`
Think
,
*NL*
dear
Rose
,
think
what
you
have
heard
to-night

'
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
what
have

heard

What

I
heard

cried
Rose
.
`
That
a
sense
*NL*
of
his
deep
disgrace
so
worked
upon
my
own
father
that
he
shunned
*NL*
all
--
there
,
we
have
said
enough
,
Harry
,
we
have
said
enough
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Not
yet
,
not
yet
,
'
said
the
young
man
,
detaining
her
as
she
rose
.
`
My
*NL*
hopes
,
my
wishes

prospects
,
feeling
:
every
thought
in
life
except
my

love

I

no
*NL*
distinction
among
a
bustling
crowd

no
mingling
with
a
world
of
malice
*NL*
and
detraction
,
where
the
blood
is
called
into
honest
cheeks
by
aught
*NL*
but
real
disgrace
and
shame
;
but
a
home
--
a
heart
and
home
--
yes
,
dearest
*NL*
Rose
,
and
those
,
and
those
alone
,
are
all
I
have
to
offer
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
do
you
mean
!
'
she
faltered
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
mean
but
this
--
that
when
I
left
you
last
,
I
left
you
with
a
firm
*NL*
determination
to
level
all
fancied
barriers
between
yourself
and
me
;
*NL*
resolved
that
if
my
world
could
not
be
yours
,
I
would
make
yours
mine
;
*NL*
that
no
pride
of
birth
should
curl
the
lip
at
you
,
for
I
would
turn
*NL*
from
it
.
This
I
have
done
.
Those
who
have
shrunk
from
me
because
of
*NL*
this
,
have
shrunk
from
you
,
and
proved
you
so
far
right
.
Such
power
*NL*
and
patronage
:
such
relatives
of
influence
and
rank
:
as
smiled
upon
*NL*
me
then
,
look
coldly
now
;
but
there
are
smiling
fields
and
waving
trees
*NL*
in
England
's
richest
county
;
and
by
one
village
church
--
mine
,
Rose
,
my
*NL*
own
!

there
stands
a
rustic
dwelling
which
you
can
make
me
prouder
of
,
*NL*
than
all
the
hopes
I
have
renounced
,
measured
a
thousandfold
.
This
is
*NL*
my
rank
and
station
now

here
I
lay
it
down

It

'
said
Mr.
Grimwig
,
*NL*
waking
up
,
and
pulling
his
pocket-handkerchief
from
over
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
Truth
to
tell
,
the
supper
had
been
waiting
a
most
unreasonable
time
.
*NL*
Neither
Mrs.
Maylie

Harry
,
nor
Rose

all
came
in
together

could

I

serious

Mr.

nothing

I
'll
take
the

liberty

*NL*
Mr.

lost
no
time
in
carrying
this
notice
into
effect
upon
the
*NL*
blushing
girl
;
and
the
example
,
being
contagious
,
was
followed
both
by
*NL*
the
doctor
and
Mr.
Brownlow
:
some
people
affirm
that
Harry
Maylie
had
*NL*
been
observed
to
set
it
,
originally
,
in
a
dark
room
adjoining
;
but
the
*NL*
best
authorities
consider
this
downright
scandal
:
he
being
young
and
a
*NL*
clergyman

Mrs.

,
`
where

CHAPTER

*NL*
*NL*
FAGIN
'S
LAST
NIGHT
ALIVE
*NL*
*NL*
The
court
was
paved
,
from
floor
to
roof
,
with
human
faces
.
Inquisitive
*NL*
and
eager
eyes
peered
from
every
inch
of
space
.
From
the
rail
before
*NL*
the
dock
,
away
into
the
sharpest
angle
of
the
smallest
corner
in
the
*NL*
galleries
,
all
looks
were
fixed
upon
one
man
--
Fagin
.
Before
him
and
*NL*
behind
:
above
,
below
,
on
the
right
and
on
the
left
:
he
seemed
to
*NL*
stand
surrounded
by
a
firmament
,
all
bright
with
gleaming
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
stood
there
,
in
all
this
glare
of
living
light
,
with
one
hand
*NL*
resting
on
the
wooden
slab
before
him
,
the
other
held
to
his
ear
,
and
*NL*
his
head
thrust
forward
to
enable
him
to
catch
with
greater
*NL*
distinctness
every
word
that
fell
from
the
presiding
judge
,
who
was
*NL*
delivering
his
charge
to
the
jury
.
At
times
,
he
turned
his
eyes
*NL*
sharply
upon
them
to
observe
the
effect
of
the
slightest
featherweight
*NL*
in
his
favour
;
and
when
the
points
against
him
were
stated
with
*NL*
terrible
distinctness
,
looked
towards
his
counsel
,
in
mute
appeal
that
*NL*
he
would
,
even
then
,
urge
something
in
his
behalf
.
Beyond
these
*NL*
manifestations
of
anxiety
,
he
stirred
not
hand
or
foot
.
He
had
*NL*
scarcely
moved
since
the
trial
began
;
and
now
that
the
judge
ceased
to
*NL*
speak
,
he
still
remained
in
the
same
strained
attitude
of
close
*NL*
attention
,
with
his
gaze
bent
on
him
,
as
though
he
listened
still
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
slight
bustle
in
the
court
,
recalled
him
to
himself
.
Looking
round
,
*NL*
he
saw
that
the
juryman
had
turned
together
,
to
consider
their
verdict
.
*NL*
As
his
eyes
wandered
to
the
gallery
,
he
could
see
the
people
rising
*NL*
above
each
other
to
see
his
face
:
some
hastily
applying
their
glasses
*NL*
to
their
eyes
:
and
others
whispering
their
neighbours
with
looks
*NL*
expressive
of
abhorrence
.
A
few
there
were
,
who
seemed
unmindful
of
*NL*
him
,
and
looked
only
to
the
jury
,
in
impatient
wonder
how
they
could
*NL*
delay
.
But
in
no
one
face
--
not
even
among
the
women
,
of
whom
there
*NL*
were
many
there
--
could
he
read
the
faintest
sympathy
with
himself
,
or
*NL*
any
feeling
but
one
of
all-absorbing
interest
that
he
should
be
*NL*
condemned
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
saw
all
this
in
one
bewildered
glance
,
the
deathlike
stillness
*NL*
came
again
,
and
looking
back
he
saw
that
the
jurymen
had
turned
towards
*NL*
the
judge
.
Hush
!
*NL*
*NL*
They
only
sought
permission
to
retire
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
,
wistfully
,
into
their
faces
,
one
by
one
when
they
passed
*NL*
out
,
as
though
to
see
which
way
the
greater
number
leant
;
but
that
was
*NL*
fruitless
.
The
jailer
touched
him
on
the
shoulder
.
He
followed
*NL*
mechanically
to
the
end
of
the
dock
,
and
sat
down
on
a
chair
.
The
man
*NL*
pointed
it
out
,
or
he
would
not
have
seen
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
up
into
the
gallery
again
.
Some
of
the
people
were
eating
,
*NL*
and
some
fanning
themselves
with
handkerchiefs
;
for
the
crowded
place
*NL*
was
very
hot
.
There
was
one
young
man
sketching
his
face
in
a
little
*NL*
note-book
.
He
wondered
whether
it
was
like
,
and
looked
on
when
the
*NL*
artist
broke
his
pencil-point
,
and
made
another
with
his
knife
,
as
any
*NL*
idle
spectator
might
have
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
same
way
,
when
he
turned
his
eyes
towards
the
judge
,
his
mind
*NL*
began
to
busy
itself
with
the
fashion
of
his
dress
,
and
what
it
cost
,
*NL*
and
how
he
put
it
on
.
There
was
an
old
fat
gentleman
on
the
bench
,
*NL*
too
,
who
had
gone
out
,
some
half
an
hour
before
,
and
now
come
back
.
He
*NL*
wondered
within
himself
whether
this
man
had
been
to
get
his
dinner
,
*NL*
what
he
had
had
,
and
where
he
had
had
it
;
and
pursued
this
train
of
*NL*
careless
thought
until
some
new
object
caught
his
eye
and
roused
*NL*
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
that
,
all
this
time
,
his
mind
was
,
for
an
instant
,
free
from
one
*NL*
oppressive
overwhelming
sense
of
the
grave
that
opened
at
his
feet
;
it
*NL*
was
ever
present
to
him
,
but
in
a
vague
and
general
way
,
and
he
could
*NL*
not
fix
his
thoughts
upon
it
.
Thus
,
even
while
he
trembled
,
and
turned
*NL*
burning
hot
at
the
idea
of
speedy
death
,
he
fell
to
counting
the
iron
*NL*
spikes
before
him
,
and
wondering
how
the
head
of
one
had
been
broken
*NL*
off
,
and
whether
they
would
mend
it
,
or
leave
it
as
it
was
.
Then
,
he
*NL*
thought
of
all
the
horrors
of
the
gallows
and
the
scaffold
--
and
stopped
*NL*
to
watch
a
man
sprinkling
the
floor
to
cool
it
--
and
then
went
on
to
*NL*
think
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
there
was
a
cry
of
silence
,
and
a
breathless
look
from
all
*NL*
towards
the
door
.
The
jury
returned
,
and
passed
him
close
.
He
could
*NL*
glean
nothing
from
their
faces
;
they
might
as
well
have
been
of
stone
.
*NL*
Perfect
stillness
ensued
--
not
a
rustle
--
not
a
breath
--
Guilty
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
building
rang
with
a
tremendous
shout
,
and
another
,
and
another
,
*NL*
and
then
it
echoed
loud
groans
,
that
gathered
strength
as
they
swelled
*NL*
out
,
like
angry
thunder
.
It
was
a
peal
of
joy
from
the
populace
*NL*
outside
,
greeting
the
news
that
he
would
die
on
Monday
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
noise
subsided
,
and
he
was
asked
if
he
had
anything
to
say
why
*NL*
sentence
of
death
should
not
be
passed
upon
him
.
He
had
resumed
his
*NL*
listening
attitude
,
and
looked
intently
at
his
questioner
while
the
*NL*
demand
was
made
;
but
it
was
twice
repeated
before
he
seemed
to
hear
it
,
*NL*
and
then
he
only
muttered
that
he
was
an
old
man
--
an
old
man
--
and
so
,
*NL*
dropping
into
a
whisper
,
was
silent
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
judge
assumed
the
black
cap
,
and
the
prisoner
still
stood
with
the
*NL*
same
air
and
gesture
.
A
woman
in
the
gallery
,
uttered
some
*NL*
exclamation
,
called
forth
by
this
dread
solemnity
;
he
looked
hastily
up
*NL*
as
if
angry
at
the
interruption
,
and
bent
forward
yet
more
attentively
.
*NL*
The
address
was
solemn
and
impressive
;
the
sentence
fearful
to
hear
.
*NL*
But
he
stood
,
like
a
marble
figure
,
without
the
motion
of
a
nerve
.
His
*NL*
haggard
face
was
still
thrust
forward
,
his
under-jaw
hanging
down
,
and
*NL*
his
eyes
staring
out
before
him
,
when
the
jailer
put
his
hand
upon
his
*NL*
arm
,
and
beckoned
him
away
.
He
gazed
stupidly
about
him
for
an
*NL*
instant
,
and
obeyed
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
led
him
through
a
paved
room
under
the
court
,
where
some
prisoners
*NL*
were
waiting
till
their
turns
came
,
and
others
were
talking
to
their
*NL*
friends
,
who
crowded
round
a
grate
which
looked
into
the
open
yard
.
*NL*
There
was
nobody
there
to
speak
to
_
him
_
;
but
,
as
he
passed
,
the
*NL*
prisoners
fell
back
to
render
him
more
visible
to
the
people
who
were
*NL*
clinging
to
the
bars
:
and
they
assailed
him
with
opprobrious
names
,
*NL*
and
screeched
and
hissed
.
He
shook
his
fist
,
and
would
have
spat
upon
*NL*
them
;
but
his
conductors
hurried
him
on
,
through
a
gloomy
passage
*NL*
lighted
by
a
few
dim
lamps
,
into
the
interior
of
the
prison
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
,
he
was
searched
,
that
he
might
not
have
about
him
the
means
of
*NL*
anticipating
the
law
;
this
ceremony
performed
,
they
led
him
to
one
of
*NL*
the
condemned
cells
,
and
left
him
there
--
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
sat
down
on
a
stone
bench
opposite
the
door
,
which
served
for
seat
*NL*
and
bedstead
;
and
casting
his
blood-shot
eyes
upon
the
ground
,
tried
to
*NL*
collect
his
thoughts
.
After
awhile
,
he
began
to
remember
a
few
*NL*
disjointed
fragments
of
what
the
judge
had
said
:
though
it
had
seemed
*NL*
to
him
,
at
the
time
,
that
he
could
not
hear
a
word
.
These
gradually
*NL*
fell
into
their
proper
places
,
and
by
degrees
suggested
more
:
so
that
*NL*
in
a
little
time
he
had
the
whole
,
almost
as
it
was
delivered
.
To
be
*NL*
hanged
by
the
neck
,
till
he
was
dead
--
that
was
the
end
.
To
be
hanged
*NL*
by
the
neck
till
he
was
dead
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
it
came
on
very
dark
,
he
began
to
think
of
all
the
men
he
had
known
*NL*
who
had
died
upon
the
scaffold
;
some
of
them
through
his
means
.
They
*NL*
rose
up
,
in
such
quick
succession
,
that
he
could
hardly
count
them
.
He
*NL*
had
seen
some
of
them
die
,
--
and
had
joked
too
,
because
they
died
with
*NL*
prayers
upon
their
lips
.
With
what
a
rattling
noise
the
drop
went
*NL*
down
;
and
how
suddenly
they
changed
,
from
strong
and
vigorous
men
to
*NL*
dangling
heaps
of
clothes
!
*NL*
*NL*
Some
of
them
might
have
inhabited
that
very
cell
--
sat
upon
that
very
*NL*
spot
.
It
was
very
dark
;
why
did
n't
they
bring
a
light
?
The
cell
had
*NL*
been
built
for
many
years
.
Scores
of
men
must
have
passed
their
last
*NL*
hours
there
.
It
was
like
sitting
in
a
vault
strewn
with
dead
*NL*
bodies
--
the
cap
,
the
noose
,
the
pinioned
arms
,
the
faces
that
he
knew
,
*NL*
even
beneath
that
hideous
veil
.
--
Light
,
light
!
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
,
when
his
hands
were
raw
with
beating
against
the
heavy
door
*NL*
and
walls
,
two
men
appeared
:
one
bearing
a
candle
,
which
he
thrust
*NL*
into
an
iron
candlestick
fixed
against
the
wall
:
the
other
dragging
in
*NL*
a
mattress
on
which
to
pass
the
night
;
for
the
prisoner
was
to
be
left
*NL*
alone
no
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
came
the
night
--
dark
,
dismal
,
silent
night
.
Other
watchers
are
*NL*
glad
to
hear
this
church-clock
strike
,
for
they
tell
of
life
and
coming
*NL*
day
.
To
him
they
brought
despair
.
The
boom
of
every
iron
bell
came
*NL*
laden
with
the
one
,
deep
,
hollow
sound
--
Death
.
What
availed
the
noise
*NL*
and
bustle
of
cheerful
morning
,
which
penetrated
even
there
,
to
him
?
*NL*
It
was
another
form
of
knell
,
with
mockery
added
to
the
warning
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
day
passed
off
.
Day
?
There
was
no
day
;
it
was
gone
as
soon
as
*NL*
come
--
and
night
came
on
again
;
night
so
long
,
and
yet
so
short
;
long
in
*NL*
its
dreadful
silence
,
and
short
in
its
fleeting
hours
.
At
one
time
he
*NL*
raved
and
blasphemed
;
and
at
another
howled
and
tore
his
hair
.
*NL*
Venerable
men
of
his
own
persuasion
had
come
to
pray
beside
him
,
but
he
*NL*
had
driven
them
away
with
curses
.
They
renewed
their
charitable
*NL*
efforts
,
and
he
beat
them
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
Saturday
night
.
He
had
only
one
night
more
to
live
.
And
as
he
thought
*NL*
of
this
,
the
day
broke
--
Sunday
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
until
the
night
of
this
last
awful
day
,
that
a
withering
*NL*
sense
of
his
helpless
,
desperate
state
came
in
its
full
intensity
upon
*NL*
his
blighted
soul
;
not
that
he
had
ever
held
any
defined
or
positive
*NL*
hope
of
mercy
,
but
that
he
had
never
been
able
to
consider
more
than
*NL*
the
dim
probability
of
dying
so
soon
.
He
had
spoken
little
to
either
of
*NL*
the
two
men
,
who
relieved
each
other
in
their
attendance
upon
him
;
and
*NL*
they
,
for
their
parts
,
made
no
effort
to
rouse
his
attention
.
He
had
*NL*
sat
there
,
awake
,
but
dreaming
.
Now
,
he
started
up
,
every
minute
,
and
*NL*
with
gasping
mouth
and
burning
skin
,
hurried
to
and
fro
,
in
such
a
*NL*
paroxysm
of
fear
and
wrath
that
even
they
--
used
to
such
*NL*
sights
--
recoiled
from
him
with
horror
.
He
grew
so
terrible
,
at
last
,
*NL*
in
all
the
tortures
of
his
evil
conscience
,
that
one
man
could
not
bear
*NL*
to
sit
there
,
eyeing
him
alone
;
and
so
the
two
kept
watch
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
cowered
down
upon
his
stone
bed
,
and
thought
of
the
past
.
He
had
*NL*
been
wounded
with
some
missiles
from
the
crowd
on
the
day
of
his
*NL*
capture
,
and
his
head
was
bandaged
with
a
linen
cloth
.
His
red
hair
*NL*
hung
down
upon
his
bloodless
face
;
his
beard
was
torn
,
and
twisted
into
*NL*
knots
;
his
eyes
shone
with
a
terrible
light
;
his
unwashed
flesh
*NL*
crackled
with
the
fever
that
burnt
him
up
.
Eight
--
nine
--
then
.
If
it
*NL*
was
not
a
trick
to
frighten
him
,
and
those
were
the
real
hours
treading
*NL*
on
each
other
's
heels
,
where
would
he
be
,
when
they
came
round
again
!
*NL*
Eleven
!
Another
struck
,
before
the
voice
of
the
previous
hour
had
*NL*
ceased
to
vibrate
.
At
eight
,
he
would
be
the
only
mourner
in
his
own
*NL*
funeral
train
;
at
eleven
--
*NL*
*NL*
Those
dreadful
walls
of
Newgate
,
which
have
hidden
so
much
misery
and
*NL*
such
unspeakable
anguish
,
not
only
from
the
eyes
,
but
,
too
often
,
and
*NL*
too
long
,
from
the
thoughts
,
of
men
,
never
held
so
dread
a
spectacle
as
*NL*
that
.
The
few
who
lingered
as
they
passed
,
and
wondered
what
the
man
*NL*
was
doing
who
was
to
be
hanged
to-morrow
,
would
have
slept
but
ill
that
*NL*
night
,
if
they
could
have
seen
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
early
in
the
evening
until
nearly
midnight
,
little
groups
of
two
*NL*
and
three
presented
themselves
at
the
lodge-gate
,
and
inquired
,
with
*NL*
anxious
faces
,
whether
any
reprieve
had
been
received
.
These
being
*NL*
answered
in
the
negative
,
communicated
the
welcome
intelligence
to
*NL*
clusters
in
the
street
,
who
pointed
out
to
one
another
the
door
from
*NL*
which
he
must
come
out
,
and
showed
where
the
scaffold
would
be
built
,
*NL*
and
,
walking
with
unwilling
steps
away
,
turned
back
to
conjure
up
the
*NL*
scene
.
By
degrees
they
fell
off
,
one
by
one
;
and
,
for
an
hour
,
in
the
*NL*
dead
of
night
,
the
street
was
left
to
solitude
and
darkness
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
space
before
the
prison
was
cleared
,
and
a
few
strong
barriers
,
*NL*
painted
black
,
had
been
already
thrown
across
the
road
to
break
the
*NL*
pressure
of
the
expected
crowd
,
when
Mr.
Brownlow
and
Oliver
appeared
*NL*
at
the
wicket
,
and
presented
an
order
of
admission
to
the
prisoner
,
*NL*
signed
by
one
of
the
sheriffs
.
They
were
immediately
admitted
into
the
*NL*
lodge
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Is
the
young
gentleman
to
come
too
,
sir
?
'
said
the
man
whose
duty
it
*NL*
was
to
conduct
them
.
`
It
's
not
a
sight
for
children
,
sir
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
is
not
indeed
,
my
friend
,
'
rejoined
Mr.
Brownlow
;
`
but
my
business
*NL*
with
this
man
is
intimately
connected
with
him
;
and
as
this
child
has
*NL*
seen
him
in
the
full
career
of
his
success
and
villainy
,
I
think
it
as
*NL*
well
--
even
at
the
cost
of
some
pain
and
fear
--
that
he
should
see
him
*NL*
now
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
These
few
words
had
been
said
apart
,
so
as
to
be
inaudible
to
Oliver
.
*NL*
The
man
touched
his
hat
;
and
glancing
at
Oliver
with
some
curiousity
,
*NL*
opened
another
gate
,
opposite
to
that
by
which
they
had
entered
,
and
*NL*
led
them
on
,
through
dark
and
winding
ways
,
towards
the
cells
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
This
,
'
said
the
man
,
stopping
in
a
gloomy
passage
where
a
couple
of
*NL*
workmen
were
making
some
preparations
in
profound
silence
--
`
this
is
the
*NL*
place
he
passes
through
.
If
you
step
this
way
,
you
can
see
the
door
he
*NL*
goes
out
at
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
led
them
into
a
stone
kitchen
,
fitted
with
coppers
for
dressing
the
*NL*
prison
food
,
and
pointed
to
a
door
.
There
was
an
open
grating
above
*NL*
it
,
through
which
came
the
sound
of
men
's
voices
,
mingled
with
the
*NL*
noise
of
hammering
,
and
the
throwing
down
of
boards
.
There
were
*NL*
putting
up
the
scaffold
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
this
place
,
they
passed
through
several
strong
gates
,
opened
by
*NL*
other
turnkeys
from
the
inner
side
;
and
,
having
entered
an
open
yard
,
*NL*
ascended
a
flight
of
narrow
steps
,
and
came
into
a
passage
with
a
row
*NL*
of
strong
doors
on
the
left
hand
.
Motioning
them
to
remain
where
they
*NL*
were
,
the
turnkey
knocked
at
one
of
these
with
his
bunch
of
keys
.
The
*NL*
two
attendants
,
after
a
little
whispering
,
came
out
into
the
passage
,
*NL*
stretching
themselves
as
if
glad
of
the
temporary
relief
,
and
motioned
*NL*
the
visitors
to
follow
the
jailer
into
the
cell
.
They
did
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
condemned
criminal
was
seated
on
his
bed
,
rocking
himself
from
side
*NL*
to
side
,
with
a
countenance
more
like
that
of
a
snared
beast
than
the
*NL*
face
of
a
man
.
His
mind
was
evidently
wandering
to
his
old
life
,
for
*NL*
he
continued
to
mutter
,
without
appearing
conscious
of
their
presence
*NL*
otherwise
than
as
a
part
of
his
vision
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Good
boy
,
Charley
--
well
done
--
'
he
mumbled
.
`
Oliver
,
too
,
ha
!
ha
!
ha
!
*NL*
Oliver
too
--
quite
the
gentleman
now
--
quite
the
--
take
that
boy
away
to
*NL*
bed
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
jailer
took
the
disengaged
hand
of
Oliver
;
and
,
whispering
him
not
*NL*
to
be
alarmed
,
looked
on
without
speaking
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Take
him
away
to
bed
!
'
cried
Fagin
.
`
Do
you
hear
me
,
some
of
you
?
He
*NL*
has
been
the
--
the
--
somehow
the
cause
of
all
this
.
It
's
worth
the
money
*NL*
to
bring
him
up
to
it
--
Bolter
's
throat
,
Bill
;
never
mind
the
*NL*
girl
--
Bolter
's
throat
as
deep
as
you
can
cut
.
Saw
his
head
off
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Fagin
,
'
said
the
jailer
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
's
me
!
'
cried
the
Jew
,
falling
instantly
,
into
the
attitude
of
*NL*
listening
he
had
assumed
upon
his
trial
.
`
An
old
man
,
my
Lord
;
a
very
*NL*
old
,
old
man
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Here
,
'
said
the
turnkey
,
laying
his
hand
upon
his
breast
to
keep
him
*NL*
down
.
`
Here
's
somebody
wants
to
see
you
,
to
ask
you
some
questions
,
I
*NL*
suppose
.
Fagin
,
Fagin
!
Are
you
a
man
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
sha
n't
be
one
long
,
'
he
replied
,
looking
up
with
a
face
retaining
no
*NL*
human
expression
but
rage
and
terror
.
`
Strike
them
all
dead
!
What
*NL*
right
have
they
to
butcher
me
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
spoke
he
caught
sight
of
Oliver
and
Mr.
Brownlow
.
Shrinking
to
*NL*
the
furthest
corner
of
the
seat
,
he
demanded
to
know
what
they
wanted
*NL*
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Steady
,
'
said
the
turnkey
,
still
holding
him
down
.
`
Now
,
sir
,
tell
*NL*
him
what
you
want
.
Quick
,
if
you
please
,
for
he
grows
worse
as
the
*NL*
time
gets
on
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
have
some
papers
,
'
said
Mr.
Brownlow
advancing
,
`
which
were
placed
*NL*
in
your
hands
,
for
better
security
,
by
a
man
called
Monks
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
's
all
a
lie
together
,
'
replied
Fagin
.
'
I
have
n't
one
--
not
one
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
For
the
love
of
God
,
'
said
Mr.
Brownlow
solemnly
,
`
do
not
say
that
*NL*
now
,
upon
the
very
verge
of
death
;
but
tell
me
where
they
are
.
You
*NL*
know
that
Sikes
is
dead
;
that
Monks
has
confessed
;
that
there
is
no
*NL*
hope
of
any
further
gain
.
Where
are
those
papers
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oliver
,
'
cried
Fagin
,
beckoning
to
him
.
`
Here
,
here
!
Let
me
whisper
*NL*
to
you
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
am
not
afraid
,
'
said
Oliver
in
a
low
voice
,
as
he
relinquished
Mr.
*NL*
Brownlow
's
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
papers
,
'
said
Fagin
,
drawing
Oliver
towards
him
,
`
are
in
a
canvas
*NL*
bag
,
in
a
hole
a
little
way
up
the
chimney
in
the
top
front-room
.
I
*NL*
want
to
talk
to
you
,
my
dear
.
I
want
to
talk
to
you
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
yes
,
'
returned
Oliver
.
`
Let
me
say
a
prayer
.
Do
!
Let
me
say
*NL*
one
prayer
.
Say
only
one
,
upon
your
knees
,
with
me
,
and
we
will
talk
*NL*
till
morning
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Outside
,
outside
,
'
replied
Fagin
,
pushing
the
boy
before
him
towards
*NL*
the
door
,
and
looking
vacantly
over
his
head
.
`
Say
I
've
gone
to
*NL*
sleep
--
they
'll
believe
you
.
You
can
get
me
out
,
if
you
take
me
so
.
*NL*
Now
then
,
now
then
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
!
God
forgive
this
wretched
man
!
'
cried
the
boy
with
a
burst
of
*NL*
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
's
right
,
that
's
right
,
'
said
Fagin
.
`
That
'll
help
us
on
.
This
*NL*
door
first
.
If
I
shake
and
tremble
,
as
we
pass
the
gallows
,
do
n't
you
*NL*
mind
,
but
hurry
on
.
Now
,
now
,
now
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Have
you
nothing
else
to
ask
him
,
sir
?
'
inquired
the
turnkey
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
other
question
,
'
replied
Mr.
Brownlow
.
`
If
I
hoped
we
could
recall
*NL*
him
to
a
sense
of
his
position
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Nothing
will
do
that
,
sir
,
'
replied
the
man
,
shaking
his
head
.
`
You
*NL*
had
better
leave
him
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
door
of
the
cell
opened
,
and
the
attendants
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Press
on
,
press
on
,
'
cried
Fagin
.
`
Softly
,
but
not
so
slow
.
Faster
,
*NL*
faster
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
men
laid
hands
upon
him
,
and
disengaging
Oliver
from
his
grasp
,
*NL*
held
him
back
.
He
struggled
with
the
power
of
desperation
,
for
an
*NL*
instant
;
and
then
sent
up
cry
upon
cry
that
penetrated
even
those
*NL*
massive
walls
,
and
rang
in
their
ears
until
they
reached
the
open
yard
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
some
time
before
they
left
the
prison
.
Oliver
nearly
swooned
*NL*
after
this
frightful
scene
,
and
was
so
weak
that
for
an
hour
or
more
,
*NL*
he
had
not
the
strength
to
walk
.
*NL*
*NL*
Day
was
dawning
when
they
again
emerged
.
A
great
multitude
had
already
*NL*
assembled
;
the
windows
were
filled
with
people
,
smoking
and
playing
*NL*
cards
to
beguile
the
time
;
the
crowd
were
pushing
,
quarrelling
,
joking
.
*NL*
Everything
told
of
life
and
animation
,
but
one
dark
cluster
of
objects
*NL*
in
the
centre
of
all
--
the
black
stage
,
the
cross-beam
,
the
rope
,
and
*NL*
all
the
hideous
apparatus
of
death
.

CHAPTER
LIII
*NL*
*NL*
AND
LAST
*NL*
*NL*
The
fortunes
of
those
who
have
figured
in
this
tale
are
nearly
closed
.
*NL*
The
little
that
remains
to
their
historian
to
relate
,
is
told
in
few
*NL*
and
simple
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
three
months
had
passed
,
Rose
Fleming
and
Harry
Maylie
were
*NL*
married
in
the
village
church
which
was
henceforth
to
be
the
scene
of
*NL*
the
young
clergyman
's
labours
;
on
the
same
day
they
entered
into
*NL*
possession
of
their
new
and
happy
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Maylie
took
up
her
abode
with
her
son
and
daughter-in-law
,
to
*NL*
enjoy
,
during
the
tranquil
remainder
of
her
days
,
the
greatest
felicity
*NL*
that
age
and
worth
can
know
--
the
contemplation
of
the
happiness
of
*NL*
those
on
whom
the
warmest
affections
and
tenderest
cares
of
a
*NL*
well-spent
life
,
have
been
unceasingly
bestowed
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
appeared
,
on
full
and
careful
investigation
,
that
if
the
wreck
of
*NL*
property
remaining
in
the
custody
of
Monks
-LRB-
which
had
never
prospered
*NL*
either
in
his
hands
or
in
those
of
his
mother
-RRB-
were
equally
divided
*NL*
between
himself
and
Oliver
,
it
would
yield
,
to
each
,
little
more
than
*NL*
three
thousand
pounds
.
By
the
provisions
of
his
father
's
will
,
Oliver
*NL*
would
have
been
entitled
to
the
whole
;
but
Mr.
Brownlow
,
unwilling
to
*NL*
deprive
the
elder
son
of
the
opportunity
of
retrieving
his
former
vices
*NL*
and
pursuing
an
honest
career
,
proposed
this
mode
of
distribution
,
to
*NL*
which
his
young
charge
joyfully
acceded
.
*NL*
*NL*
Monks
,
still
bearing
that
assumed
name
,
retired
with
his
portion
to
a
*NL*
distant
part
of
the
New
World
;
where
,
having
quickly
squandered
it
,
he
*NL*
once
more
fell
into
his
old
courses
,
and
,
after
undergoing
a
long
*NL*
confinement
for
some
fresh
act
of
fraud
and
knavery
,
at
length
sunk
*NL*
under
an
attack
of
his
old
disorder
,
and
died
in
prison
.
As
far
from
*NL*
home
,
died
the
chief
remaining
members
of
his
friend
Fagin
's
gang
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Brownlow
adopted
Oliver
as
his
son
.
Removing
with
him
and
the
old
*NL*
housekeeper
to
within
a
mile
of
the
parsonage-house
,
where
his
dear
*NL*
friends
resided
,
he
gratified
the
only
remaining
wish
of
Oliver
's
warm
*NL*
and
earnest
heart
,
and
thus
linked
together
a
little
society
,
whose
*NL*
condition
approached
as
nearly
to
one
of
perfect
happiness
as
can
ever
*NL*
be
known
in
this
changing
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
Soon
after
the
marriage
of
the
young
people
,
the
worthy
doctor
returned
*NL*
to
Chertsey
,
where
,
bereft
of
the
presence
of
his
old
friends
,
he
would
*NL*
have
been
discontented
if
his
temperament
had
admitted
of
such
a
*NL*
feeling
;
and
would
have
turned
quite
peevish
if
he
had
known
how
.
For
*NL*
two
or
three
months
,
he
contented
himself
with
hinting
that
he
feared
*NL*
the
air
began
to
disagree
with
him
;
then
,
finding
that
the
place
really
*NL*
no
longer
was
,
to
him
,
what
it
had
been
,
he
settled
his
business
on
his
*NL*
assistant
,
took
a
bachelor
's
cottage
outside
the
village
of
which
his
*NL*
young
friend
was
pastor
,
and
instantaneously
recovered
.
Here
he
took
*NL*
to
gardening
,
planting
,
fishing
,
carpentering
,
and
various
other
*NL*
pursuits
of
a
similar
kind
:
all
undertaken
with
his
characteristic
*NL*
impetuosity
.
In
each
and
all
he
has
since
become
famous
throughout
the
*NL*
neighborhood
,
as
a
most
profound
authority
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
his
removal
,
he
had
managed
to
contract
a
strong
friendship
for
*NL*
Mr.
Grimwig
,
which
that
eccentric
gentleman
cordially
reciprocated
.
He
*NL*
is
accordingly
visited
by
Mr.
Grimwig
a
great
many
times
in
the
course
*NL*
of
the
year
.
On
all
such
occasions
,
Mr.
Grimwig
plants
,
fishes
,
and
*NL*
carpenters
,
with
great
ardour
;
doing
everything
in
a
very
singular
and
*NL*
unprecedented
manner
,
but
always
maintaining
with
his
favourite
*NL*
asseveration
,
that
his
mode
is
the
right
one
.
On
Sundays
,
he
never
*NL*
fails
to
criticise
the
sermon
to
the
young
clergyman
's
face
:
always
*NL*
informing
Mr.
Losberne
,
in
strict
confidence
afterwards
,
that
he
*NL*
considers
it
an
excellent
performance
,
but
deems
it
as
well
not
to
say
*NL*
so
.
It
is
a
standing
and
very
favourite
joke
,
for
Mr.
Brownlow
to
*NL*
rally
him
on
his
old
prophecy
concerning
Oliver
,
and
to
remind
him
of
*NL*
the
night
on
which
they
sat
with
the
watch
between
them
,
waiting
his
*NL*
return
;
but
Mr.
Grimwig
contends
that
he
was
right
in
the
main
,
and
,
in
*NL*
proof
thereof
,
remarks
that
Oliver
did
not
come
back
after
all
;
which
*NL*
always
calls
forth
a
laugh
on
his
side
,
and
increases
his
good
humour
.

at
a
loss
for
the
means
of
a
livelihood
,
not
burdened
*NL*
with
too
much
work
.
After
some
consideration
,
he
went
into
business
as
*NL*
an
Informer
,
in
which
calling
he
realises
a
genteel
subsistence
.
His
*NL*
plan
is
,
to
walk
out
once
a
week
during
church
time
attended
by
*NL*
Charlotte
in
respectable
attire
.
The
lady
faints
away
at
the
doors
of
*NL*
charitable
publicans
,
and
the
gentleman
being
accommodated
with
*NL*
three-penny
worth
of
brandy
to
restore
her
,
lays
an
information
next
*NL*
day
,
and
pockets
half
the
penalty
.
Sometimes
Mr.
Claypole
faints
*NL*
himself
,
but
the
result
is
the
same
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Bumble
,
deprived
of
their
situations
,
were
gradually
*NL*
reduced
to
great
indigence
and
misery
,
and
finally
became
paupers
in
*NL*
that
very
same
workhouse
in
which
they
had
once
lorded
it
over
others
.
*NL*
Mr.
Bumble
has
been
heard
to
say
,
that
in
this
reverse
and
degradation
,
*NL*
he
has
not
even
spirits
to
be
thankful
for
being
separated
from
his
*NL*
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
to
Mr.
Giles
and
Brittles
,
they
still
remain
in
their
old
posts
,
*NL*
although
the
former
is
bald
,
and
the
last-named
boy
quite
grey
.
They
*NL*
sleep
at
the
parsonage
,
but
divide
their
attentions
so
equally
among
*NL*
its
inmates
,
and
Oliver
and
Mr.
Brownlow
,
and
Mr.
Losberne
,
that
to
*NL*
this
day
the
villagers
have
never
been
able
to
discover
to
which
*NL*
establishment
they
properly
belong
.
*NL*
*NL*
Master
Charles
Bates
,
appalled
by
Sikes
's
crime
,
fell
into
a
train
of
*NL*
reflection
whether
an
honest
life
was
not
,
after
all
,
the
best
.
*NL*
Arriving
at
the
conclusion
that
it
certainly
was
,
he
turned
his
back
*NL*
upon
the
scenes
of
the
past
,
resolved
to
amend
it
in
some
new
sphere
of
*NL*
action
.
He
struggled
hard
,
and
suffered
much
,
for
some
time
;
but
,
*NL*
having
a
contented
disposition
,
and
a
good
purpose
,
succeeded
in
the
*NL*
end
;
and
,
from
being
a
farmer
's
drudge
,
and
a
carrier
's
lad
,
he
is
now
*NL*
the
merriest
young
grazier
in
all
Northamptonshire
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
,
the
hand
that
traces
these
words
,
falters
,
as
it
approaches
*NL*
the
conclusion
of
its
task
;
and
would
weave
,
for
a
little
longer
space
,
*NL*
the
thread
of
these
adventures
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
would
fain
linger
yet
with
a
few
of
those
among
whom
I
have
so
long
*NL*
moved
,
and
share
their
happiness
by
endeavouring
to
depict
it
.
I
would
*NL*
show
Rose
Maylie
in
all
the
bloom
and
grace
of
early
womanhood
,
*NL*
shedding
on
her
secluded
path
in
life
soft
and
gentle
light
,
that
fell
*NL*
on
all
who
trod
it
with
her
,
and
shone
into
their
hearts
.
I
would
*NL*
paint
her
the
life
and
joy
of
the
fire-side
circle
and
the
lively
*NL*
summer
group
;
I
would
follow
her
through
the
sultry
fields
at
noon
,
and
*NL*
hear
the
low
tones
of
her
sweet
voice
in
the
moonlit
evening
walk
;
I
*NL*
would
watch
her
in
all
her
goodness
and
charity
abroad
,
and
the
smiling
*NL*
untiring
discharge
of
domestic
duties
at
home
;
I
would
paint
her
and
*NL*
her
dead
sister
's
child
happy
in
their
love
for
one
another
,
and
*NL*
passing
whole
hours
together
in
picturing
the
friends
whom
they
had
so
*NL*
sadly
lost
;
I
would
summon
before
me
,
once
again
,
those
joyous
little
*NL*
faces
that
clustered
round
her
knee
,
and
listen
to
their
merry
prattle
;
*NL*
I
would
recall
the
tones
of
that
clear
laugh
,
and
conjure
up
the
*NL*
sympathising
tear
that
glistened
in
the
soft
blue
eye
.
These
,
and
a
*NL*
thousand
looks
and
smiles
,
and
turns
of
thought
and
speech
--
I
would
*NL*
fain
recall
them
every
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
Mr.
Brownlow
went
on
,
from
day
to
day
,
filling
the
mind
of
his
*NL*
adopted
child
with
stores
of
knowledge
,
and
becoming
attached
to
him
,
*NL*
more
and
more
,
as
his
nature
developed
itself
,
and
showed
the
thriving
*NL*
seeds
of
all
he
wished
him
to
become
--
how
he
traced
in
him
new
traits
*NL*
of
his
early
friend
,
that
awakened
in
his
own
bosom
old
remembrances
,
*NL*
melancholy
and
yet
sweet
and
soothing
--
how
the
two
orphans
,
tried
by
*NL*
adversity
,
remembered
its
lessons
in
mercy
to
others
,
and
mutual
love
,
*NL*
and
fervent
thanks
to
Him
who
had
protected
and
preserved
them
--
these
*NL*
are
all
matters
which
need
not
to
be
told
.
I
have
said
that
they
were
*NL*
truly
happy
;
and
without
strong
affection
and
humanity
of
heart
,
and
*NL*
gratitude
to
that
Being
whose
code
is
Mercy
,
and
whose
great
attribute
*NL*
is
Benevolence
to
all
things
that
breathe
,
happiness
can
never
be
*NL*
attained
.
*NL*
*NL*
Within
the
altar
of
the
old
village
church
there
stands
a
white
marble
*NL*
tablet
,
which
bears
as
yet
but
one
word
:
`
AGNES
.
'
There
is
no
coffin
*NL*
in
that
tomb
;
and
may
it
be
many
,
many
years
,
before
another
name
is
*NL*
placed
above
it
!
But
,
if
the
spirits
of
the
Dead
ever
come
back
to
*NL*
earth
,
to
visit
spots
hallowed
by
the
love
--
the
love
beyond
the
*NL*
grave
--
of
those
whom
they
knew
in
life
,
I
believe
that
the
shade
of
*NL*
Agnes
sometimes
hovers
round
that
solemn
nook
.
I
believe
it
none
the
*NL*
less
because
that
nook
is
in
a
Church
,
and
she
was
weak
and
erring
.
