PART
I
.
The
Wild
Land
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
*NL*
*NL*
One
January
day
,
thirty
years
ago
,
the
little
town
of
Hanover
,
*NL*
anchored
on
a
windy
Nebraska
tableland
,
was
trying
not
to
be
blown
*NL*
away
.
A
mist
of
fine
snowflakes
was
curling
and
eddying
about
the
*NL*
cluster
of
low
drab
buildings
huddled
on
the
gray
prairie
,
under
*NL*
a
gray
sky
.
The
dwelling-houses
were
set
about
haphazard
on
the
*NL*
tough
prairie
sod
;
some
of
them
looked
as
if
they
had
been
moved
in
*NL*
overnight
,
and
others
as
if
they
were
straying
off
by
themselves
,
*NL*
headed
straight
for
the
open
plain
.
None
of
them
had
any
appearance
*NL*
of
permanence
,
and
the
howling
wind
blew
under
them
as
well
as
over
*NL*
them
.
The
main
street
was
a
deeply
rutted
road
,
now
frozen
hard
,
*NL*
which
ran
from
the
squat
red
railway
station
and
the
grain
``
elevator
''
*NL*
at
the
north
end
of
the
town
to
the
lumber
yard
and
the
horse
pond
*NL*
at
the
south
end
.
On
either
side
of
this
road
straggled
two
uneven
*NL*
rows
of
wooden
buildings
;
the
general
merchandise
stores
,
the
two
*NL*
banks
,
the
drug
store
,
the
feed
store
,
the
saloon
,
the
post-office
.
*NL*
The
board
sidewalks
were
gray
with
trampled
snow
,
but
at
two
o'clock
*NL*
in
the
afternoon
the
shopkeepers
,
having
come
back
from
dinner
,
*NL*
were
keeping
well
behind
their
frosty
windows
.
The
children
were
*NL*
all
in
school
,
and
there
was
nobody
abroad
in
the
streets
but
a
*NL*
few
rough-looking
countrymen
in
coarse
overcoats
,
with
their
long
*NL*
caps
pulled
down
to
their
noses
.
Some
of
them
had
brought
their
*NL*
wives
to
town
,
and
now
and
then
a
red
or
a
plaid
shawl
flashed
out
*NL*
of
one
store
into
the
shelter
of
another
.
At
the
hitch-bars
along
*NL*
the
street
a
few
heavy
work-horses
,
harnessed
to
farm
wagons
,
*NL*
shivered
under
their
blankets
.
About
the
station
everything
was
*NL*
quiet
,
for
there
would
not
be
another
train
in
until
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
sidewalk
in
front
of
one
of
the
stores
sat
a
little
Swede
*NL*
boy
,
crying
bitterly
.
He
was
about
five
years
old
.
His
black
cloth
*NL*
coat
was
much
too
big
for
him
and
made
him
look
like
a
little
old
*NL*
man
.
His
shrunken
brown
flannel
dress
had
been
washed
many
times
*NL*
and
left
a
long
stretch
of
stocking
between
the
hem
of
his
skirt
*NL*
and
the
tops
of
his
clumsy
,
copper-toed
shoes
.
His
cap
was
pulled
*NL*
down
over
his
ears
;
his
nose
and
his
chubby
cheeks
were
chapped
and
*NL*
red
with
cold
.
He
cried
quietly
,
and
the
few
people
who
hurried
*NL*
by
did
not
notice
him
.
He
was
afraid
to
stop
any
one
,
afraid
to
*NL*
go
into
the
store
and
ask
for
help
,
so
he
sat
wringing
his
long
*NL*
sleeves
and
looking
up
a
telegraph
pole
beside
him
,
whimpering
,
``
My
*NL*
kitten
,
oh
,
my
kitten
!
Her
will
fweeze
!
''
At
the
top
of
the
pole
*NL*
crouched
a
shivering
gray
kitten
,
mewing
faintly
and
clinging
*NL*
desperately
to
the
wood
with
her
claws
.
The
boy
had
been
left
*NL*
at
the
store
while
his
sister
went
to
the
doctor
's
office
,
and
in
*NL*
her
absence
a
dog
had
chased
his
kitten
up
the
pole
.
The
little
*NL*
creature
had
never
been
so
high
before
,
and
she
was
too
frightened
*NL*
to
move
.
Her
master
was
sunk
in
despair
.
He
was
a
little
country
*NL*
boy
,
and
this
village
was
to
him
a
very
strange
and
perplexing
*NL*
place
,
where
people
wore
fine
clothes
and
had
hard
hearts
.
He
*NL*
always
felt
shy
and
awkward
here
,
and
wanted
to
hide
behind
things
*NL*
for
fear
some
one
might
laugh
at
him
.
Just
now
,
he
was
too
unhappy
*NL*
to
care
who
laughed
.
At
last
he
seemed
to
see
a
ray
of
hope
:
his
*NL*
sister
was
coming
,
and
he
got
up
and
ran
toward
her
in
his
heavy
*NL*
shoes
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
sister
was
a
tall
,
strong
girl
,
and
she
walked
rapidly
and
*NL*
resolutely
,
as
if
she
knew
exactly
where
she
was
going
and
what
she
*NL*
was
going
to
do
next
.
She
wore
a
man
's
long
ulster
-LRB-
not
as
if
it
*NL*
were
an
affliction
,
but
as
if
it
were
very
comfortable
and
belonged
*NL*
to
her
;
carried
it
like
a
young
soldier
-RRB-
,
and
a
round
plush
cap
,
*NL*
tied
down
with
a
thick
veil
.
She
had
a
serious
,
thoughtful
face
,
*NL*
and
her
clear
,
deep
blue
eyes
were
fixed
intently
on
the
distance
,
*NL*
without
seeming
to
see
anything
,
as
if
she
were
in
trouble
.
She
*NL*
did
not
notice
the
little
boy
until
he
pulled
her
by
the
coat
.
*NL*
Then
she
stopped
short
and
stooped
down
to
wipe
his
wet
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
Emil
!
I
told
you
to
stay
in
the
store
and
not
to
come
out
.
*NL*
What
is
the
matter
with
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
kitten
,
sister
,
my
kitten
!
A
man
put
her
out
,
and
a
dog
chased
*NL*
her
up
there
.
''
His
forefinger
,
projecting
from
the
sleeve
of
his
*NL*
coat
,
pointed
up
to
the
wretched
little
creature
on
the
pole
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Emil
!
Did
n't
I
tell
you
she
'd
get
us
into
trouble
of
some
*NL*
kind
,
if
you
brought
her
?
What
made
you
tease
me
so
?
But
there
,
*NL*
I
ought
to
have
known
better
myself
.
''
She
went
to
the
foot
of
the
*NL*
pole
and
held
out
her
arms
,
crying
,
``
Kitty
,
kitty
,
kitty
,
''
but
the
*NL*
kitten
only
mewed
and
faintly
waved
its
tail
.
Alexandra
turned
*NL*
away
decidedly
.
``
No
,
she
wo
n't
come
down
.
Somebody
will
have
to
*NL*
go
up
after
her
.
I
saw
the
Linstrums
'
wagon
in
town
.
I
'll
go
and
*NL*
see
if
I
can
find
Carl
.
Maybe
he
can
do
something
.
Only
you
must
*NL*
stop
crying
,
or
I
wo
n't
go
a
step
.
Where
's
your
comforter
?
Did
*NL*
you
leave
it
in
the
store
?
Never
mind
.
Hold
still
,
till
I
put
*NL*
this
on
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
unwound
the
brown
veil
from
her
head
and
tied
it
about
his
*NL*
throat
.
A
shabby
little
traveling
man
,
who
was
just
then
coming
out
*NL*
of
the
store
on
his
way
to
the
saloon
,
stopped
and
gazed
stupidly
*NL*
at
the
shining
mass
of
hair
she
bared
when
she
took
off
her
veil
;
*NL*
two
thick
braids
,
pinned
about
her
head
in
the
German
way
,
with
a
*NL*
fringe
of
reddish-yellow
curls
blowing
out
from
under
her
cap
.
He
*NL*
took
his
cigar
out
of
his
mouth
and
held
the
wet
end
between
the
*NL*
fingers
of
his
woolen
glove
.
``
My
God
,
girl
,
what
a
head
of
hair
!
''
*NL*
he
exclaimed
,
quite
innocently
and
foolishly
.
She
stabbed
him
with
*NL*
a
glance
of
Amazonian
fierceness
and
drew
in
her
lower
lip
--
most
*NL*
unnecessary
severity
.
It
gave
the
little
clothing
drummer
such
a
*NL*
start
that
he
actually
let
his
cigar
fall
to
the
sidewalk
and
went
*NL*
off
weakly
in
the
teeth
of
the
wind
to
the
saloon
.
His
hand
was
*NL*
still
unsteady
when
he
took
his
glass
from
the
bartender
.
His
*NL*
feeble
flirtatious
instincts
had
been
crushed
before
,
but
never
*NL*
so
mercilessly
.
He
felt
cheap
and
ill-used
,
as
if
some
one
had
*NL*
taken
advantage
of
him
.
When
a
drummer
had
been
knocking
about
in
*NL*
little
drab
towns
and
crawling
across
the
wintry
country
in
dirty
*NL*
smoking-cars
,
was
he
to
be
blamed
if
,
when
he
chanced
upon
a
fine
*NL*
human
creature
,
he
suddenly
wished
himself
more
of
a
man
?
*NL*
*NL*
While
the
little
drummer
was
drinking
to
recover
his
nerve
,
Alexandra
*NL*
hurried
to
the
drug
store
as
the
most
likely
place
to
find
Carl
*NL*
Linstrum
.
There
he
was
,
turning
over
a
portfolio
of
chromo
``
studies
''
*NL*
which
the
druggist
sold
to
the
Hanover
women
who
did
china-painting
.
*NL*
Alexandra
explained
her
predicament
,
and
the
boy
followed
her
to
*NL*
the
corner
,
where
Emil
still
sat
by
the
pole
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
have
to
go
up
after
her
,
Alexandra
.
I
think
at
the
depot
*NL*
they
have
some
spikes
I
can
strap
on
my
feet
.
Wait
a
minute
.
''
Carl
*NL*
thrust
his
hands
into
his
pockets
,
lowered
his
head
,
and
darted
up
*NL*
the
street
against
the
north
wind
.
He
was
a
tall
boy
of
fifteen
,
*NL*
slight
and
narrow-chested
.
When
he
came
back
with
the
spikes
,
*NL*
Alexandra
asked
him
what
he
had
done
with
his
overcoat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
left
it
in
the
drug
store
.
I
could
n't
climb
in
it
,
anyhow
.
*NL*
Catch
me
if
I
fall
,
Emil
,
''
he
called
back
as
he
began
his
ascent
.
*NL*
Alexandra
watched
him
anxiously
;
the
cold
was
bitter
enough
on
the
*NL*
ground
.
The
kitten
would
not
budge
an
inch
.
Carl
had
to
go
to
*NL*
the
very
top
of
the
pole
,
and
then
had
some
difficulty
in
tearing
*NL*
her
from
her
hold
.
When
he
reached
the
ground
,
he
handed
the
cat
*NL*
to
her
tearful
little
master
.
``
Now
go
into
the
store
with
her
,
*NL*
Emil
,
and
get
warm
.
''
He
opened
the
door
for
the
child
.
``
Wait
a
*NL*
minute
,
Alexandra
.
Why
ca
n't
I
drive
for
you
as
far
as
our
place
?
*NL*
It
's
getting
colder
every
minute
.
Have
you
seen
the
doctor
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
He
is
coming
over
to-morrow
.
But
he
says
father
ca
n't
*NL*
get
better
;
ca
n't
get
well
.
''
The
girl
's
lip
trembled
.
She
looked
*NL*
fixedly
up
the
bleak
street
as
if
she
were
gathering
her
strength
*NL*
to
face
something
,
as
if
she
were
trying
with
all
her
might
to
*NL*
grasp
a
situation
which
,
no
matter
how
painful
,
must
be
met
and
*NL*
dealt
with
somehow
.
The
wind
flapped
the
skirts
of
her
heavy
coat
*NL*
about
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carl
did
not
say
anything
,
but
she
felt
his
sympathy
.
He
,
too
,
was
*NL*
lonely
.
He
was
a
thin
,
frail
boy
,
with
brooding
dark
eyes
,
very
*NL*
quiet
in
all
his
movements
.
There
was
a
delicate
pallor
in
his
thin
*NL*
face
,
and
his
mouth
was
too
sensitive
for
a
boy
's
.
The
lips
had
*NL*
already
a
little
curl
of
bitterness
and
skepticism
.
The
two
friends
*NL*
stood
for
a
few
moments
on
the
windy
street
corner
,
not
speaking
*NL*
a
word
,
as
two
travelers
,
who
have
lost
their
way
,
sometimes
stand
*NL*
and
admit
their
perplexity
in
silence
.
When
Carl
turned
away
he
*NL*
said
,
``
I
'll
see
to
your
team
.
''
Alexandra
went
into
the
store
to
*NL*
have
her
purchases
packed
in
the
egg-boxes
,
and
to
get
warm
before
*NL*
she
set
out
on
her
long
cold
drive
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
looked
for
Emil
,
she
found
him
sitting
on
a
step
of
the
*NL*
staircase
that
led
up
to
the
clothing
and
carpet
department
.
He
*NL*
was
playing
with
a
little
Bohemian
girl
,
Marie
Tovesky
,
who
was
*NL*
tying
her
handkerchief
over
the
kitten
's
head
for
a
bonnet
.
Marie
*NL*
was
a
stranger
in
the
country
,
having
come
from
Omaha
with
her
mother
*NL*
to
visit
her
uncle
,
Joe
Tovesky
.
She
was
a
dark
child
,
with
brown
*NL*
curly
hair
,
like
a
brunette
doll
's
,
a
coaxing
little
red
mouth
,
and
*NL*
round
,
yellow-brown
eyes
.
Every
one
noticed
her
eyes
;
the
brown
*NL*
iris
had
golden
glints
that
made
them
look
like
gold-stone
,
or
,
in
*NL*
softer
lights
,
like
that
Colorado
mineral
called
tiger-eye
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
country
children
thereabouts
wore
their
dresses
to
their
*NL*
shoe-tops
,
but
this
city
child
was
dressed
in
what
was
then
called
*NL*
the
``
Kate
Greenaway
''
manner
,
and
her
red
cashmere
frock
,
gathered
*NL*
full
from
the
yoke
,
came
almost
to
the
floor
.
This
,
with
her
*NL*
poke
bonnet
,
gave
her
the
look
of
a
quaint
little
woman
.
She
had
*NL*
a
white
fur
tippet
about
her
neck
and
made
no
fussy
objections
when
*NL*
Emil
fingered
it
admiringly
.
Alexandra
had
not
the
heart
to
take
*NL*
him
away
from
so
pretty
a
playfellow
,
and
she
let
them
tease
the
*NL*
kitten
together
until
Joe
Tovesky
came
in
noisily
and
picked
up
*NL*
his
little
niece
,
setting
her
on
his
shoulder
for
every
one
to
see
.
*NL*
His
children
were
all
boys
,
and
he
adored
this
little
creature
.
*NL*
His
cronies
formed
a
circle
about
him
,
admiring
and
teasing
the
*NL*
little
girl
,
who
took
their
jokes
with
great
good
nature
.
They
*NL*
were
all
delighted
with
her
,
for
they
seldom
saw
so
pretty
and
*NL*
carefully
nurtured
a
child
.
They
told
her
that
she
must
choose
*NL*
one
of
them
for
a
sweetheart
,
and
each
began
pressing
his
suit
and
*NL*
offering
her
bribes
;
candy
,
and
little
pigs
,
and
spotted
calves
.
*NL*
She
looked
archly
into
the
big
,
brown
,
mustached
faces
,
smelling
*NL*
of
spirits
and
tobacco
,
then
she
ran
her
tiny
forefinger
delicately
*NL*
over
Joe
's
bristly
chin
and
said
,
``
Here
is
my
sweetheart
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Bohemians
roared
with
laughter
,
and
Marie
's
uncle
hugged
her
*NL*
until
she
cried
,
``
Please
do
n't
,
Uncle
Joe
!
You
hurt
me
.
''
Each
*NL*
of
Joe
's
friends
gave
her
a
bag
of
candy
,
and
she
kissed
them
all
*NL*
around
,
though
she
did
not
like
country
candy
very
well
.
Perhaps
*NL*
that
was
why
she
bethought
herself
of
Emil
.
``
Let
me
down
,
Uncle
*NL*
Joe
,
''
she
said
,
``
I
want
to
give
some
of
my
candy
to
that
nice
little
*NL*
boy
I
found
.
''
She
walked
graciously
over
to
Emil
,
followed
by
her
*NL*
lusty
admirers
,
who
formed
a
new
circle
and
teased
the
little
boy
*NL*
until
he
hid
his
face
in
his
sister
's
skirts
,
and
she
had
to
scold
*NL*
him
for
being
such
a
baby
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
farm
people
were
making
preparations
to
start
for
home
.
The
*NL*
women
were
checking
over
their
groceries
and
pinning
their
big
red
*NL*
shawls
about
their
heads
.
The
men
were
buying
tobacco
and
candy
*NL*
with
what
money
they
had
left
,
were
showing
each
other
new
boots
and
*NL*
gloves
and
blue
flannel
shirts
.
Three
big
Bohemians
were
drinking
*NL*
raw
alcohol
,
tinctured
with
oil
of
cinnamon
.
This
was
said
to
*NL*
fortify
one
effectually
against
the
cold
,
and
they
smacked
their
*NL*
lips
after
each
pull
at
the
flask
.
Their
volubility
drowned
every
*NL*
other
noise
in
the
place
,
and
the
overheated
store
sounded
of
*NL*
their
spirited
language
as
it
reeked
of
pipe
smoke
,
damp
woolens
,
*NL*
and
kerosene
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carl
came
in
,
wearing
his
overcoat
and
carrying
a
wooden
box
with
*NL*
a
brass
handle
.
``
Come
,
''
he
said
,
``
I
've
fed
and
watered
your
team
,
*NL*
and
the
wagon
is
ready
.
''
He
carried
Emil
out
and
tucked
him
down
*NL*
in
the
straw
in
the
wagonbox
.
The
heat
had
made
the
little
boy
*NL*
sleepy
,
but
he
still
clung
to
his
kitten
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
were
awful
good
to
climb
so
high
and
get
my
kitten
,
Carl
.
*NL*
When
I
get
big
I
'll
climb
and
get
little
boys
'
kittens
for
them
,
''
*NL*
he
murmured
drowsily
.
Before
the
horses
were
over
the
first
hill
,
*NL*
Emil
and
his
cat
were
both
fast
asleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
Although
it
was
only
four
o'clock
,
the
winter
day
was
fading
.
The
*NL*
road
led
southwest
,
toward
the
streak
of
pale
,
watery
light
that
*NL*
glimmered
in
the
leaden
sky
.
The
light
fell
upon
the
two
sad
young
*NL*
faces
that
were
turned
mutely
toward
it
:
upon
the
eyes
of
the
girl
,
*NL*
who
seemed
to
be
looking
with
such
anguished
perplexity
into
the
*NL*
future
;
upon
the
sombre
eyes
of
the
boy
,
who
seemed
already
to
be
*NL*
looking
into
the
past
.
The
little
town
behind
them
had
vanished
as
*NL*
if
it
had
never
been
,
had
fallen
behind
the
swell
of
the
prairie
,
*NL*
and
the
stern
frozen
country
received
them
into
its
bosom
.
The
*NL*
homesteads
were
few
and
far
apart
;
here
and
there
a
windmill
gaunt
*NL*
against
the
sky
,
a
sod
house
crouching
in
a
hollow
.
But
the
great
*NL*
fact
was
the
land
itself
,
which
seemed
to
overwhelm
the
little
*NL*
beginnings
of
human
society
that
struggled
in
its
sombre
wastes
.
*NL*
It
was
from
facing
this
vast
hardness
that
the
boy
's
mouth
had
*NL*
become
so
bitter
;
because
he
felt
that
men
were
too
weak
to
make
*NL*
any
mark
here
,
that
the
land
wanted
to
be
let
alone
,
to
preserve
*NL*
its
own
fierce
strength
,
its
peculiar
,
savage
kind
of
beauty
,
its
*NL*
uninterrupted
mournfulness
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
wagon
jolted
along
over
the
frozen
road
.
The
two
friends
had
*NL*
less
to
say
to
each
other
than
usual
,
as
if
the
cold
had
somehow
*NL*
penetrated
to
their
hearts
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
Lou
and
Oscar
go
to
the
Blue
to
cut
wood
to-day
?
''
Carl
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
I
'm
almost
sorry
I
let
them
go
,
it
's
turned
so
cold
.
But
*NL*
mother
frets
if
the
wood
gets
low
.
''
She
stopped
and
put
her
hand
*NL*
to
her
forehead
,
brushing
back
her
hair
.
``
I
do
n't
know
what
is
to
*NL*
become
of
us
,
Carl
,
if
father
has
to
die
.
I
do
n't
dare
to
think
*NL*
about
it
.
I
wish
we
could
all
go
with
him
and
let
the
grass
grow
*NL*
back
over
everything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carl
made
no
reply
.
Just
ahead
of
them
was
the
Norwegian
graveyard
,
*NL*
where
the
grass
had
,
indeed
,
grown
back
over
everything
,
shaggy
and
*NL*
red
,
hiding
even
the
wire
fence
.
Carl
realized
that
he
was
not
a
*NL*
very
helpful
companion
,
but
there
was
nothing
he
could
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
,
''
Alexandra
went
on
,
steadying
her
voice
a
little
,
``
the
*NL*
boys
are
strong
and
work
hard
,
but
we
've
always
depended
so
on
*NL*
father
that
I
do
n't
see
how
we
can
go
ahead
.
I
almost
feel
as
if
*NL*
there
were
nothing
to
go
ahead
for
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
your
father
know
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
think
he
does
.
He
lies
and
counts
on
his
fingers
all
day
.
*NL*
I
think
he
is
trying
to
count
up
what
he
is
leaving
for
us
.
It
's
*NL*
a
comfort
to
him
that
my
chickens
are
laying
right
on
through
the
*NL*
cold
weather
and
bringing
in
a
little
money
.
I
wish
we
could
keep
*NL*
his
mind
off
such
things
,
but
I
do
n't
have
much
time
to
be
with
*NL*
him
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wonder
if
he
'd
like
to
have
me
bring
my
magic
lantern
over
some
*NL*
evening
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alexandra
turned
her
face
toward
him
.
``
Oh
,
Carl
!
Have
you
got
*NL*
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
It
's
back
there
in
the
straw
.
Did
n't
you
notice
the
box
*NL*
I
was
carrying
?
I
tried
it
all
morning
in
the
drug-store
cellar
,
*NL*
and
it
worked
ever
so
well
,
makes
fine
big
pictures
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
they
about
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
hunting
pictures
in
Germany
,
and
Robinson
Crusoe
and
funny
*NL*
pictures
about
cannibals
.
I
'm
going
to
paint
some
slides
for
it
*NL*
on
glass
,
out
of
the
Hans
Andersen
book
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alexandra
seemed
actually
cheered
.
There
is
often
a
good
deal
of
*NL*
the
child
left
in
people
who
have
had
to
grow
up
too
soon
.
``
Do
*NL*
bring
it
over
,
Carl
.
I
can
hardly
wait
to
see
it
,
and
I
'm
sure
it
*NL*
will
please
father
.
Are
the
pictures
colored
?
Then
I
know
he
'll
*NL*
like
them
.
He
likes
the
calendars
I
get
him
in
town
.
I
wish
I
*NL*
could
get
more
.
You
must
leave
me
here
,
must
n't
you
?
It
's
been
*NL*
nice
to
have
company
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carl
stopped
the
horses
and
looked
dubiously
up
at
the
black
sky
.
*NL*
``
It
's
pretty
dark
.
Of
course
the
horses
will
take
you
home
,
but
*NL*
I
think
I
'd
better
light
your
lantern
,
in
case
you
should
need
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
gave
her
the
reins
and
climbed
back
into
the
wagon-box
,
where
*NL*
he
crouched
down
and
made
a
tent
of
his
overcoat
.
After
a
dozen
*NL*
trials
he
succeeded
in
lighting
the
lantern
,
which
he
placed
in
*NL*
front
of
Alexandra
,
half
covering
it
with
a
blanket
so
that
the
*NL*
light
would
not
shine
in
her
eyes
.
``
Now
,
wait
until
I
find
my
box
.
*NL*
Yes
,
here
it
is
.
Good-night
,
Alexandra
.
Try
not
to
worry
.
''
Carl
*NL*
sprang
to
the
ground
and
ran
off
across
the
fields
toward
the
Linstrum
*NL*
homestead
.
``
Hoo
,
hoo-o-o-o
!
''
he
called
back
as
he
disappeared
over
*NL*
a
ridge
and
dropped
into
a
sand
gully
.
The
wind
answered
him
like
*NL*
an
echo
,
``
Hoo
,
hoo-o-o-o-o-o
!
''
Alexandra
drove
off
alone
.
The
*NL*
rattle
of
her
wagon
was
lost
in
the
howling
of
the
wind
,
but
her
*NL*
lantern
,
held
firmly
between
her
feet
,
made
a
moving
point
of
light
*NL*
along
the
highway
,
going
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
dark
country
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
II
*NL*
*NL*
On
one
of
the
ridges
of
that
wintry
waste
stood
the
low
log
house
*NL*
in
which
John
Bergson
was
dying
.
The
Bergson
homestead
was
easier
*NL*
to
find
than
many
another
,
because
it
overlooked
Norway
Creek
,
a
*NL*
shallow
,
muddy
stream
that
sometimes
flowed
,
and
sometimes
stood
*NL*
still
,
at
the
bottom
of
a
winding
ravine
with
steep
,
shelving
sides
*NL*
overgrown
with
brush
and
cottonwoods
and
dwarf
ash
.
This
creek
*NL*
gave
a
sort
of
identity
to
the
farms
that
bordered
upon
it
.
Of
all
*NL*
the
bewildering
things
about
a
new
country
,
the
absence
of
human
*NL*
landmarks
is
one
of
the
most
depressing
and
disheartening
.
The
*NL*
houses
on
the
Divide
were
small
and
were
usually
tucked
away
*NL*
in
low
places
;
you
did
not
see
them
until
you
came
directly
upon
*NL*
them
.
Most
of
them
were
built
of
the
sod
itself
,
and
were
only
*NL*
the
unescapable
ground
in
another
form
.
The
roads
were
but
faint
*NL*
tracks
in
the
grass
,
and
the
fields
were
scarcely
noticeable
.
The
*NL*
record
of
the
plow
was
insignificant
,
like
the
feeble
scratches
on
*NL*
stone
left
by
prehistoric
races
,
so
indeterminate
that
they
may
,
*NL*
after
all
,
be
only
the
markings
of
glaciers
,
and
not
a
record
of
*NL*
human
strivings
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
eleven
long
years
John
Bergson
had
made
but
little
impression
*NL*
upon
the
wild
land
he
had
come
to
tame
.
It
was
still
a
wild
thing
*NL*
that
had
its
ugly
moods
;
and
no
one
knew
when
they
were
likely
to
*NL*
come
,
or
why
.
Mischance
hung
over
it
.
Its
Genius
was
unfriendly
*NL*
to
man
.
The
sick
man
was
feeling
this
as
he
lay
looking
out
of
*NL*
the
window
,
after
the
doctor
had
left
him
,
on
the
day
following
*NL*
Alexandra
's
trip
to
town
.
There
it
lay
outside
his
door
,
the
same
*NL*
land
,
the
same
lead-colored
miles
.
He
knew
every
ridge
and
draw
*NL*
and
gully
between
him
and
the
horizon
.
To
the
south
,
his
plowed
*NL*
fields
;
to
the
east
,
the
sod
stables
,
the
cattle
corral
,
the
*NL*
pond
,
--
and
then
the
grass
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bergson
went
over
in
his
mind
the
things
that
had
held
him
back
.
*NL*
One
winter
his
cattle
had
perished
in
a
blizzard
.
The
next
summer
*NL*
one
of
his
plow
horses
broke
its
leg
in
a
prairiedog
hole
and
had
*NL*
to
be
shot
.
Another
summer
he
lost
his
hogs
from
cholera
,
and
*NL*
a
valuable
stallion
died
from
a
rattlesnake
bite
.
Time
and
again
*NL*
his
crops
had
failed
.
He
had
lost
two
children
,
boys
,
that
came
*NL*
between
Lou
and
Emil
,
and
there
had
been
the
cost
of
sickness
and
*NL*
death
.
Now
,
when
he
had
at
last
struggled
out
of
debt
,
he
was
*NL*
going
to
die
himself
.
He
was
only
forty-six
,
and
had
,
of
course
,
*NL*
counted
upon
more
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bergson
had
spent
his
first
five
years
on
the
Divide
getting
into
*NL*
debt
,
and
the
last
six
getting
out
.
He
had
paid
off
his
mortgages
*NL*
and
had
ended
pretty
much
where
he
began
,
with
the
land
.
He
owned
*NL*
exactly
six
hundred
and
forty
acres
of
what
stretched
outside
his
*NL*
door
;
his
own
original
homestead
and
timber
claim
,
making
three
*NL*
hundred
and
twenty
acres
,
and
the
half-section
adjoining
,
the
*NL*
homestead
of
a
younger
brother
who
had
given
up
the
fight
,
gone
*NL*
back
to
Chicago
to
work
in
a
fancy
bakery
and
distinguish
himself
*NL*
in
a
Swedish
athletic
club
.
So
far
John
had
not
attempted
to
*NL*
cultivate
the
second
half-section
,
but
used
it
for
pasture
land
,
*NL*
and
one
of
his
sons
rode
herd
there
in
open
weather
.
*NL*
*NL*
John
Bergson
had
the
Old-World
belief
that
land
,
in
itself
,
is
*NL*
desirable
.
But
this
land
was
an
enigma
.
It
was
like
a
horse
that
*NL*
no
one
knows
how
to
break
to
harness
,
that
runs
wild
and
kicks
*NL*
things
to
pieces
.
He
had
an
idea
that
no
one
understood
how
to
*NL*
farm
it
properly
,
and
this
he
often
discussed
with
Alexandra
.
Their
*NL*
neighbors
,
certainly
,
knew
even
less
about
farming
than
he
did
.
*NL*
Many
of
them
had
never
worked
on
a
farm
until
they
took
up
their
*NL*
homesteads
.
They
had
been
HANDWERKERS
at
home
;
tailors
,
locksmiths
,
*NL*
joiners
,
cigar-makers
,
etc.
.
Bergson
himself
had
worked
in
a
*NL*
shipyard
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
weeks
,
John
Bergson
had
been
thinking
about
these
things
.
His
*NL*
bed
stood
in
the
sitting-room
,
next
to
the
kitchen
.
Through
the
*NL*
day
,
while
the
baking
and
washing
and
ironing
were
going
on
,
the
*NL*
father
lay
and
looked
up
at
the
roof
beams
that
he
himself
had
*NL*
hewn
,
or
out
at
the
cattle
in
the
corral
.
He
counted
the
cattle
*NL*
over
and
over
.
It
diverted
him
to
speculate
as
to
how
much
weight
*NL*
each
of
the
steers
would
probably
put
on
by
spring
.
He
often
called
*NL*
his
daughter
in
to
talk
to
her
about
this
.
Before
Alexandra
was
*NL*
twelve
years
old
she
had
begun
to
be
a
help
to
him
,
and
as
she
grew
*NL*
older
he
had
come
to
depend
more
and
more
upon
her
resourcefulness
*NL*
and
good
judgment
.
His
boys
were
willing
enough
to
work
,
but
when
*NL*
he
talked
with
them
they
usually
irritated
him
.
It
was
Alexandra
*NL*
who
read
the
papers
and
followed
the
markets
,
and
who
learned
by
*NL*
the
mistakes
of
their
neighbors
.
It
was
Alexandra
who
could
always
*NL*
tell
about
what
it
had
cost
to
fatten
each
steer
,
and
who
could
*NL*
guess
the
weight
of
a
hog
before
it
went
on
the
scales
closer
than
*NL*
John
Bergson
himself
.
Lou
and
Oscar
were
industrious
,
but
he
could
*NL*
never
teach
them
to
use
their
heads
about
their
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alexandra
,
her
father
often
said
to
himself
,
was
like
her
*NL*
grandfather
;
which
was
his
way
of
saying
that
she
was
intelligent
.
*NL*
John
Bergson
's
father
had
been
a
shipbuilder
,
a
man
of
considerable
*NL*
force
and
of
some
fortune
.
Late
in
life
he
married
a
second
time
,
*NL*
a
Stockholm
woman
of
questionable
character
,
much
younger
than
he
,
*NL*
who
goaded
him
into
every
sort
of
extravagance
.
On
the
shipbuilder
's
*NL*
part
,
this
marriage
was
an
infatuation
,
the
despairing
folly
of
*NL*
a
powerful
man
who
can
not
bear
to
grow
old
.
In
a
few
years
his
*NL*
unprincipled
wife
warped
the
probity
of
a
lifetime
.
He
speculated
,
*NL*
lost
his
own
fortune
and
funds
entrusted
to
him
by
poor
seafaring
*NL*
men
,
and
died
disgraced
,
leaving
his
children
nothing
.
But
when
all
*NL*
was
said
,
he
had
come
up
from
the
sea
himself
,
had
built
up
a
proud
*NL*
little
business
with
no
capital
but
his
own
skill
and
foresight
,
and
*NL*
had
proved
himself
a
man
.
In
his
daughter
,
John
Bergson
recognized
*NL*
the
strength
of
will
,
and
the
simple
direct
way
of
thinking
things
*NL*
out
,
that
had
characterized
his
father
in
his
better
days
.
He
*NL*
would
much
rather
,
of
course
,
have
seen
this
likeness
in
one
of
*NL*
his
sons
,
but
it
was
not
a
question
of
choice
.
As
he
lay
there
*NL*
day
after
day
he
had
to
accept
the
situation
as
it
was
,
and
to
be
*NL*
thankful
that
there
was
one
among
his
children
to
whom
he
could
*NL*
entrust
the
future
of
his
family
and
the
possibilities
of
his
*NL*
hard-won
land
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
winter
twilight
was
fading
.
The
sick
man
heard
his
wife
strike
*NL*
a
match
in
the
kitchen
,
and
the
light
of
a
lamp
glimmered
through
*NL*
the
cracks
of
the
door
.
It
seemed
like
a
light
shining
far
away
.
*NL*
He
turned
painfully
in
his
bed
and
looked
at
his
white
hands
,
with
*NL*
all
the
work
gone
out
of
them
.
He
was
ready
to
give
up
,
he
felt
.
*NL*
He
did
not
know
how
it
had
come
about
,
but
he
was
quite
willing
to
*NL*
go
deep
under
his
fields
and
rest
,
where
the
plow
could
not
find
*NL*
him
.
He
was
tired
of
making
mistakes
.
He
was
content
to
leave
the
*NL*
tangle
to
other
hands
;
he
thought
of
his
Alexandra
's
strong
ones
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
DOTTER
,
''
he
called
feebly
,
``
DOTTER
!
''
He
heard
her
quick
step
and
*NL*
saw
her
tall
figure
appear
in
the
doorway
,
with
the
light
of
the
*NL*
lamp
behind
her
.
He
felt
her
youth
and
strength
,
how
easily
she
*NL*
moved
and
stooped
and
lifted
.
But
he
would
not
have
had
it
again
*NL*
if
he
could
,
not
he
!
He
knew
the
end
too
well
to
wish
to
begin
*NL*
again
.
He
knew
where
it
all
went
to
,
what
it
all
became
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
daughter
came
and
lifted
him
up
on
his
pillows
.
She
called
*NL*
him
by
an
old
Swedish
name
that
she
used
to
call
him
when
she
was
*NL*
little
and
took
his
dinner
to
him
in
the
shipyard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
the
boys
to
come
here
,
daughter
.
I
want
to
speak
to
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
feeding
the
horses
,
father
.
They
have
just
come
back
*NL*
from
the
Blue
.
Shall
I
call
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
sighed
.
``
No
,
no
.
Wait
until
they
come
in
.
Alexandra
,
you
will
*NL*
have
to
do
the
best
you
can
for
your
brothers
.
Everything
will
*NL*
come
on
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
do
all
I
can
,
father
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
let
them
get
discouraged
and
go
off
like
Uncle
Otto
.
I
want
*NL*
them
to
keep
the
land
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
will
,
father
.
We
will
never
lose
the
land
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
sound
of
heavy
feet
in
the
kitchen
.
Alexandra
went
*NL*
to
the
door
and
beckoned
to
her
brothers
,
two
strapping
boys
of
*NL*
seventeen
and
nineteen
.
They
came
in
and
stood
at
the
foot
of
the
*NL*
bed
.
Their
father
looked
at
them
searchingly
,
though
it
was
too
*NL*
dark
to
see
their
faces
;
they
were
just
the
same
boys
,
he
told
*NL*
himself
,
he
had
not
been
mistaken
in
them
.
The
square
head
and
*NL*
heavy
shoulders
belonged
to
Oscar
,
the
elder
.
The
younger
boy
was
*NL*
quicker
,
but
vacillating
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Boys
,
''
said
the
father
wearily
,
``
I
want
you
to
keep
the
land
*NL*
together
and
to
be
guided
by
your
sister
.
I
have
talked
to
her
*NL*
since
I
have
been
sick
,
and
she
knows
all
my
wishes
.
I
want
no
*NL*
quarrels
among
my
children
,
and
so
long
as
there
is
one
house
there
*NL*
must
be
one
head
.
Alexandra
is
the
oldest
,
and
she
knows
my
wishes
.
*NL*
She
will
do
the
best
she
can
.
If
she
makes
mistakes
,
she
will
not
*NL*
make
so
many
as
I
have
made
.
When
you
marry
,
and
want
a
house
of
*NL*
your
own
,
the
land
will
be
divided
fairly
,
according
to
the
courts
.
*NL*
But
for
the
next
few
years
you
will
have
it
hard
,
and
you
must
all
*NL*
keep
together
.
Alexandra
will
manage
the
best
she
can
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Oscar
,
who
was
usually
the
last
to
speak
,
replied
because
he
*NL*
was
the
older
,
``
Yes
,
father
.
It
would
be
so
anyway
,
without
your
*NL*
speaking
.
We
will
all
work
the
place
together
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
will
be
guided
by
your
sister
,
boys
,
and
be
good
brothers
*NL*
to
her
,
and
good
sons
to
your
mother
?
That
is
good
.
And
Alexandra
*NL*
must
not
work
in
the
fields
any
more
.
There
is
no
necessity
now
.
*NL*
Hire
a
man
when
you
need
help
.
She
can
make
much
more
with
her
*NL*
eggs
and
butter
than
the
wages
of
a
man
.
It
was
one
of
my
mistakes
*NL*
that
I
did
not
find
that
out
sooner
.
Try
to
break
a
little
more
*NL*
land
every
year
;
sod
corn
is
good
for
fodder
.
Keep
turning
the
*NL*
land
,
and
always
put
up
more
hay
than
you
need
.
Do
n't
grudge
your
*NL*
mother
a
little
time
for
plowing
her
garden
and
setting
out
fruit
*NL*
trees
,
even
if
it
comes
in
a
busy
season
.
She
has
been
a
good
*NL*
mother
to
you
,
and
she
has
always
missed
the
old
country
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
went
back
to
the
kitchen
the
boys
sat
down
silently
at
*NL*
the
table
.
Throughout
the
meal
they
looked
down
at
their
plates
*NL*
and
did
not
lift
their
red
eyes
.
They
did
not
eat
much
,
although
*NL*
they
had
been
working
in
the
cold
all
day
,
and
there
was
a
rabbit
*NL*
stewed
in
gravy
for
supper
,
and
prune
pies
.
*NL*
*NL*
John
Bergson
had
married
beneath
him
,
but
he
had
married
a
good
*NL*
housewife
.
Mrs.
Bergson
was
a
fair-skinned
,
corpulent
woman
,
heavy
*NL*
and
placid
like
her
son
,
Oscar
,
but
there
was
something
comfortable
*NL*
about
her
;
perhaps
it
was
her
own
love
of
comfort
.
For
eleven
years
*NL*
she
had
worthily
striven
to
maintain
some
semblance
of
household
*NL*
order
amid
conditions
that
made
order
very
difficult
.
Habit
*NL*
was
very
strong
with
Mrs.
Bergson
,
and
her
unremitting
efforts
to
*NL*
repeat
the
routine
of
her
old
life
among
new
surroundings
had
done
*NL*
a
great
deal
to
keep
the
family
from
disintegrating
morally
and
*NL*
getting
careless
in
their
ways
.
The
Bergsons
had
a
log
house
,
for
*NL*
instance
,
only
because
Mrs.
Bergson
would
not
live
in
a
sod
house
.
*NL*
She
missed
the
fish
diet
of
her
own
country
,
and
twice
every
summer
*NL*
she
sent
the
boys
to
the
river
,
twenty
miles
to
the
southward
,
to
*NL*
fish
for
channel
cat
.
When
the
children
were
little
she
used
to
*NL*
load
them
all
into
the
wagon
,
the
baby
in
its
crib
,
and
go
fishing
*NL*
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alexandra
often
said
that
if
her
mother
were
cast
upon
a
desert
*NL*
island
,
she
would
thank
God
for
her
deliverance
,
make
a
garden
,
*NL*
and
find
something
to
preserve
.
Preserving
was
almost
a
mania
with
*NL*
Mrs.
Bergson
.
Stout
as
she
was
,
she
roamed
the
scrubby
banks
of
*NL*
Norway
Creek
looking
for
fox
grapes
and
goose
plums
,
like
a
wild
*NL*
creature
in
search
of
prey
.
She
made
a
yellow
jam
of
the
insipid
*NL*
ground-cherries
that
grew
on
the
prairie
,
flavoring
it
with
lemon
*NL*
peel
;
and
she
made
a
sticky
dark
conserve
of
garden
tomatoes
.
She
*NL*
had
experimented
even
with
the
rank
buffalo-pea
,
and
she
could
*NL*
not
see
a
fine
bronze
cluster
of
them
without
shaking
her
head
and
*NL*
murmuring
,
``
What
a
pity
!
''
When
there
was
nothing
more
to
preserve
,
*NL*
she
began
to
pickle
.
The
amount
of
sugar
she
used
in
these
processes
*NL*
was
sometimes
a
serious
drain
upon
the
family
resources
.
She
was
*NL*
a
good
mother
,
but
she
was
glad
when
her
children
were
old
enough
*NL*
not
to
be
in
her
way
in
the
kitchen
.
She
had
never
quite
forgiven
*NL*
John
Bergson
for
bringing
her
to
the
end
of
the
earth
;
but
,
now
*NL*
that
she
was
there
,
she
wanted
to
be
let
alone
to
reconstruct
her
*NL*
old
life
in
so
far
as
that
was
possible
.
She
could
still
take
some
*NL*
comfort
in
the
world
if
she
had
bacon
in
the
cave
,
glass
jars
on
*NL*
the
shelves
,
and
sheets
in
the
press
.
She
disapproved
of
all
her
*NL*
neighbors
because
of
their
slovenly
housekeeping
,
and
the
women
*NL*
thought
her
very
proud
.
Once
when
Mrs.
Bergson
,
on
her
way
to
*NL*
Norway
Creek
,
stopped
to
see
old
Mrs.
Lee
,
the
old
woman
hid
in
*NL*
the
haymow
``
for
fear
Mis
'
Bergson
would
catch
her
barefoot
.

*NL*
One
Sunday
afternoon
in
July
,
six
months
after
John
Bergson
's
death
,
*NL*
Carl
was
sitting
in
the
doorway
of
the
Linstrum
kitchen
,
dreaming
*NL*
over
an
illustrated
paper
,
when
he
heard
the
rattle
of
a
wagon
along
*NL*
the
hill
road
.
Looking
up
he
recognized
the
Bergsons
'
team
,
with
*NL*
two
seats
in
the
wagon
,
which
meant
they
were
off
for
a
pleasure
*NL*
excursion
.
Oscar
and
Lou
,
on
the
front
seat
,
wore
their
cloth
hats
*NL*
and
coats
,
never
worn
except
on
Sundays
,
and
Emil
,
on
the
second
*NL*
seat
with
Alexandra
,
sat
proudly
in
his
new
trousers
,
made
from
a
*NL*
pair
of
his
father
's
,
and
a
pink-striped
shirt
,
with
a
wide
ruffled
*NL*
collar
.
Oscar
stopped
the
horses
and
waved
to
Carl
,
who
caught
up
*NL*
his
hat
and
ran
through
the
melon
patch
to
join
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Want
to
go
with
us
?
''
Lou
called
.
``
We
're
going
to
Crazy
Ivar
's
to
*NL*
buy
a
hammock
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sure
.
''
Carl
ran
up
panting
,
and
clambering
over
the
wheel
sat
*NL*
down
beside
Emil
.
``
I
've
always
wanted
to
see
Ivar
's
pond
.
They
*NL*
say
it
's
the
biggest
in
all
the
country
.
Are
n't
you
afraid
to
go
*NL*
to
Ivar
's
in
that
new
shirt
,
Emil
?
He
might
want
it
and
take
it
*NL*
right
off
your
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Emil
grinned
.
``
I
'd
be
awful
scared
to
go
,
''
he
admitted
,
``
if
you
*NL*
big
boys
were
n't
along
to
take
care
of
me
.
Did
you
ever
hear
him
*NL*
howl
,
Carl
?
People
say
sometimes
he
runs
about
the
country
howling
*NL*
at
night
because
he
is
afraid
the
Lord
will
destroy
him
.
Mother
*NL*
thinks
he
must
have
done
something
awful
wicked
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lou
looked
back
and
winked
at
Carl
.
``
What
would
you
do
,
Emil
,
if
*NL*
you
was
out
on
the
prairie
by
yourself
and
seen
him
coming
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Emil
stared
.
``
Maybe
I
could
hide
in
a
badger-hole
,
''
he
suggested
*NL*
doubtfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
suppose
there
was
n't
any
badger-hole
,
''
Lou
persisted
.
``
Would
*NL*
you
run
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
'd
be
too
scared
to
run
,
''
Emil
admitted
mournfully
,
twisting
*NL*
his
fingers
.
``
I
guess
I
'd
sit
right
down
on
the
ground
and
say
my
*NL*
prayers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
big
boys
laughed
,
and
Oscar
brandished
his
whip
over
the
broad
*NL*
backs
of
the
horses
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
would
n't
hurt
you
,
Emil
,
''
said
Carl
persuasively
.
``
He
came
*NL*
to
doctor
our
mare
when
she
ate
green
corn
and
swelled
up
most
as
*NL*
big
as
the
water-tank
.
He
petted
her
just
like
you
do
your
cats
.
*NL*
I
could
n't
understand
much
he
said
,
for
he
do
n't
talk
any
English
,
*NL*
but
he
kept
patting
her
and
groaning
as
if
he
had
the
pain
himself
,
*NL*
and
saying
,
`
There
now
,
sister
,
that
's
easier
,
that
's
better
!
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lou
and
Oscar
laughed
,
and
Emil
giggled
delightedly
and
looked
up
*NL*
at
his
sister
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
he
knows
anything
at
all
about
doctoring
,
''
said
*NL*
Oscar
scornfully
.
``
They
say
when
horses
have
distemper
he
takes
*NL*
the
medicine
himself
,
and
then
prays
over
the
horses
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alexandra
spoke
up
.
``
That
's
what
the
Crows
said
,
but
he
cured
*NL*
their
horses
,
all
the
same
.
Some
days
his
mind
is
cloudy
,
like
.
*NL*
But
if
you
can
get
him
on
a
clear
day
,
you
can
learn
a
great
deal
*NL*
from
him
.
He
understands
animals
.
Did
n't
I
see
him
take
the
horn
*NL*
off
the
Berquist
's
cow
when
she
had
torn
it
loose
and
went
crazy
?
*NL*
She
was
tearing
all
over
the
place
,
knocking
herself
against
things
.
*NL*
And
at
last
she
ran
out
on
the
roof
of
the
old
dugout
and
her
legs
*NL*
went
through
and
there
she
stuck
,
bellowing
.
Ivar
came
running
*NL*
with
his
white
bag
,
and
the
moment
he
got
to
her
she
was
quiet
and
*NL*
let
him
saw
her
horn
off
and
daub
the
place
with
tar
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Emil
had
been
watching
his
sister
,
his
face
reflecting
the
sufferings
*NL*
of
the
cow
.
``
And
then
did
n't
it
hurt
her
any
more
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alexandra
patted
him
.
``
No
,
not
any
more
.
And
in
two
days
they
*NL*
could
use
her
milk
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
road
to
Ivar
's
homestead
was
a
very
poor
one
.
He
had
settled
*NL*
in
the
rough
country
across
the
county
line
,
where
no
one
lived
but
*NL*
some
Russians
,
--
half
a
dozen
families
who
dwelt
together
in
one
long
*NL*
house
,
divided
off
like
barracks
.
Ivar
had
explained
his
choice
*NL*
by
saying
that
the
fewer
neighbors
he
had
,
the
fewer
temptations
.
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
when
one
considered
that
his
chief
business
was
*NL*
horse-doctoring
,
it
seemed
rather
short-sighted
of
him
to
live
in
the
*NL*
most
inaccessible
place
he
could
find
.
The
Bergson
wagon
lurched
*NL*
along
over
the
rough
hummocks
and
grass
banks
,
followed
the
bottom
*NL*
of
winding
draws
,
or
skirted
the
margin
of
wide
lagoons
,
where
the
*NL*
golden
coreopsis
grew
up
out
of
the
clear
water
and
the
wild
ducks
*NL*
rose
with
a
whirr
of
wings
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lou
looked
after
them
helplessly
.
``
I
wish
I
'd
brought
my
gun
,
*NL*
anyway
,
Alexandra
,
''
he
said
fretfully
.
``
I
could
have
hidden
it
*NL*
under
the
straw
in
the
bottom
of
the
wagon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
we
'd
have
had
to
lie
to
Ivar
.
Besides
,
they
say
he
can
smell
*NL*
dead
birds
.
And
if
he
knew
,
we
would
n't
get
anything
out
of
him
,
*NL*
not
even
a
hammock
.
I
want
to
talk
to
him
,
and
he
wo
n't
talk
sense
*NL*
if
he
's
angry
.
It
makes
him
foolish
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lou
sniffed
.
``
Whoever
heard
of
him
talking
sense
,
anyhow
!
I
'd
*NL*
rather
have
ducks
for
supper
than
Crazy
Ivar
's
tongue
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Emil
was
alarmed
.
``
Oh
,
but
,
Lou
,
you
do
n't
want
to
make
him
mad
!
*NL*
He
might
howl
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
all
laughed
again
,
and
Oscar
urged
the
horses
up
the
crumbling
*NL*
side
of
a
clay
bank
.
They
had
left
the
lagoons
and
the
red
grass
*NL*
behind
them
.
In
Crazy
Ivar
's
country
the
grass
was
short
and
gray
,
*NL*
the
draws
deeper
than
they
were
in
the
Bergsons
'
neighborhood
,
*NL*
and
the
land
was
all
broken
up
into
hillocks
and
clay
ridges
.
The
*NL*
wild
flowers
disappeared
,
and
only
in
the
bottom
of
the
draws
and
*NL*
gullies
grew
a
few
of
the
very
toughest
and
hardiest
:
shoestring
,
*NL*
and
ironweed
,
and
snow-on-the-mountain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
,
look
,
Emil
,
there
's
Ivar
's
big
pond
!
''
Alexandra
pointed
to
*NL*
a
shining
sheet
of
water
that
lay
at
the
bottom
of
a
shallow
draw
.
*NL*
At
one
end
of
the
pond
was
an
earthen
dam
,
planted
with
green
willow
*NL*
bushes
,
and
above
it
a
door
and
a
single
window
were
set
into
the
*NL*
hillside
.
You
would
not
have
seen
them
at
all
but
for
the
reflection
*NL*
of
the
sunlight
upon
the
four
panes
of
window-glass
.
And
that
was
*NL*
all
you
saw
.
Not
a
shed
,
not
a
corral
,
not
a
well
,
not
even
a
path
*NL*
broken
in
the
curly
grass
.
But
for
the
piece
of
rusty
stovepipe
*NL*
sticking
up
through
the
sod
,
you
could
have
walked
over
the
roof
*NL*
of
Ivar
's
dwelling
without
dreaming
that
you
were
near
a
human
*NL*
habitation
.
Ivar
had
lived
for
three
years
in
the
clay
bank
,
*NL*
without
defiling
the
face
of
nature
any
more
than
the
coyote
that
*NL*
had
lived
there
before
him
had
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
Bergsons
drove
over
the
hill
,
Ivar
was
sitting
in
the
*NL*
doorway
of
his
house
,
reading
the
Norwegian
Bible
.
He
was
a
queerly
*NL*
shaped
old
man
,
with
a
thick
,
powerful
body
set
on
short
bow-legs
.
*NL*
His
shaggy
white
hair
,
falling
in
a
thick
mane
about
his
ruddy
*NL*
cheeks
,
made
him
look
older
than
he
was
.
He
was
barefoot
,
but
*NL*
he
wore
a
clean
shirt
of
unbleached
cotton
,
open
at
the
neck
.
He
*NL*
always
put
on
a
clean
shirt
when
Sunday
morning
came
round
,
though
*NL*
he
never
went
to
church
.
He
had
a
peculiar
religion
of
his
own
*NL*
and
could
not
get
on
with
any
of
the
denominations
.
Often
he
did
*NL*
not
see
anybody
from
one
week
's
end
to
another
.
He
kept
a
calendar
,
*NL*
and
every
morning
he
checked
off
a
day
,
so
that
he
was
never
in
*NL*
any
doubt
as
to
which
day
of
the
week
it
was
.
Ivar
hired
himself
*NL*
out
in
threshing
and
corn-husking
time
,
and
he
doctored
sick
animals
*NL*
when
he
was
sent
for
.
When
he
was
at
home
,
he
made
hammocks
out
*NL*
of
twine
and
committed
chapters
of
the
Bible
to
memory
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ivar
found
contentment
in
the
solitude
he
had
sought
out
for
himself
.
*NL*
He
disliked
the
litter
of
human
dwellings
:
the
broken
food
,
the
*NL*
bits
of
broken
china
,
the
old
wash-boilers
and
tea-kettles
thrown
*NL*
into
the
sunflower
patch
.
He
preferred
the
cleanness
and
tidiness
of
*NL*
the
wild
sod
.
He
always
said
that
the
badgers
had
cleaner
houses
*NL*
than
people
,
and
that
when
he
took
a
housekeeper
her
name
would
*NL*
be
Mrs.
Badger
.
He
best
expressed
his
preference
for
his
wild
*NL*
homestead
by
saying
that
his
Bible
seemed
truer
to
him
there
.
If
*NL*
one
stood
in
the
doorway
of
his
cave
,
and
looked
off
at
the
rough
*NL*
land
,
the
smiling
sky
,
the
curly
grass
white
in
the
hot
sunlight
;
*NL*
if
one
listened
to
the
rapturous
song
of
the
lark
,
the
drumming
of
*NL*
the
quail
,
the
burr
of
the
locust
against
that
vast
silence
,
one
*NL*
understood
what
Ivar
meant
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
this
Sunday
afternoon
his
face
shone
with
happiness
.
He
closed
*NL*
the
book
on
his
knee
,
keeping
the
place
with
his
horny
finger
,
and
*NL*
repeated
softly
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
He
sendeth
the
springs
into
the
valleys
,
which
run
among
the
hills
;
*NL*
*NL*
They
give
drink
to
every
beast
of
the
field
;
the
wild
asses
quench
*NL*
their
thirst
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
trees
of
the
Lord
are
full
of
sap
;
the
cedars
of
Lebanon
which
*NL*
he
hath
planted
;
*NL*
*NL*
Where
the
birds
make
their
nests
:
as
for
the
stork
,
the
fir
trees
*NL*
are
her
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
high
hills
are
a
refuge
for
the
wild
goats
;
and
the
rocks
for
*NL*
the
conies
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
he
opened
his
Bible
again
,
Ivar
heard
the
Bergsons
'
wagon
*NL*
approaching
,
and
he
sprang
up
and
ran
toward
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
guns
,
no
guns
!
''
he
shouted
,
waving
his
arms
distractedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Ivar
,
no
guns
,
''
Alexandra
called
reassuringly
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
dropped
his
arms
and
went
up
to
the
wagon
,
smiling
amiably
and
*NL*
looking
at
them
out
of
his
pale
blue
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
want
to
buy
a
hammock
,
if
you
have
one
,
''
Alexandra
explained
,
*NL*
``
and
my
little
brother
,
here
,
wants
to
see
your
big
pond
,
where
so
*NL*
many
birds
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ivar
smiled
foolishly
,
and
began
rubbing
the
horses
'
noses
and
*NL*
feeling
about
their
mouths
behind
the
bits
.
``
Not
many
birds
just
*NL*
now
.
A
few
ducks
this
morning
;
and
some
snipe
come
to
drink
.
But
*NL*
there
was
a
crane
last
week
.
She
spent
one
night
and
came
back
the
*NL*
next
evening
.
I
do
n't
know
why
.
It
is
not
her
season
,
of
course
.
*NL*
Many
of
them
go
over
in
the
fall
.
Then
the
pond
is
full
of
strange
*NL*
voices
every
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alexandra
translated
for
Carl
,
who
looked
thoughtful
.
``
Ask
him
,
*NL*
Alexandra
,
if
it
is
true
that
a
sea
gull
came
here
once
.
I
have
*NL*
heard
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
some
difficulty
in
making
the
old
man
understand
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
puzzled
at
first
,
then
smote
his
hands
together
as
he
*NL*
remembered
.
``
Oh
,
yes
,
yes
!
A
big
white
bird
with
long
wings
and
*NL*
pink
feet
.
My
!
what
a
voice
she
had
!
She
came
in
the
afternoon
*NL*
and
kept
flying
about
the
pond
and
screaming
until
dark
.
She
was
*NL*
in
trouble
of
some
sort
,
but
I
could
not
understand
her
.
She
was
*NL*
going
over
to
the
other
ocean
,
maybe
,
and
did
not
know
how
far
it
*NL*
was
.
She
was
afraid
of
never
getting
there
.
She
was
more
mournful
*NL*
than
our
birds
here
;
she
cried
in
the
night
.
She
saw
the
light
*NL*
from
my
window
and
darted
up
to
it
.
Maybe
she
thought
my
house
*NL*
was
a
boat
,
she
was
such
a
wild
thing
.
Next
morning
,
when
the
sun
*NL*
rose
,
I
went
out
to
take
her
food
,
but
she
flew
up
into
the
sky
*NL*
and
went
on
her
way
.
''
Ivar
ran
his
fingers
through
his
thick
hair
.
*NL*
``
I
have
many
strange
birds
stop
with
me
here
.
They
come
from
very
*NL*
far
away
and
are
great
company
.
I
hope
you
boys
never
shoot
wild
*NL*
birds
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lou
and
Oscar
grinned
,
and
Ivar
shook
his
bushy
head
.
``
Yes
,
I
know
*NL*
boys
are
thoughtless
.
But
these
wild
things
are
God
's
birds
.
He
*NL*
watches
over
them
and
counts
them
,
as
we
do
our
cattle
;
Christ
says
*NL*
so
in
the
New
Testament
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Ivar
,
''
Lou
asked
,
``
may
we
water
our
horses
at
your
pond
and
*NL*
give
them
some
feed
?
It
's
a
bad
road
to
your
place
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
it
is
.
''
The
old
man
scrambled
about
and
began
to
loose
*NL*
the
tugs
.
``
A
bad
road
,
eh
,
girls
?
And
the
bay
with
a
colt
at
*NL*
home
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Oscar
brushed
the
old
man
aside
.
``
We
'll
take
care
of
the
horses
,
*NL*
Ivar
.
You
'll
be
finding
some
disease
on
them
.
Alexandra
wants
to
*NL*
see
your
hammocks
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ivar
led
Alexandra
and
Emil
to
his
little
cave
house
.
He
had
but
*NL*
one
room
,
neatly
plastered
and
whitewashed
,
and
there
was
a
wooden
*NL*
floor
.
There
was
a
kitchen
stove
,
a
table
covered
with
oilcloth
,
*NL*
two
chairs
,
a
clock
,
a
calendar
,
a
few
books
on
the
window-shelf
;
*NL*
nothing
more
.
But
the
place
was
as
clean
as
a
cupboard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
where
do
you
sleep
,
Ivar
?
''
Emil
asked
,
looking
about
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ivar
unslung
a
hammock
from
a
hook
on
the
wall
;
in
it
was
rolled
*NL*
a
buffalo
robe
.
``
There
,
my
son
.
A
hammock
is
a
good
bed
,
and
in
*NL*
winter
I
wrap
up
in
this
skin
.
Where
I
go
to
work
,
the
beds
are
*NL*
not
half
so
easy
as
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
By
this
time
Emil
had
lost
all
his
timidity
.
He
thought
a
cave
a
*NL*
very
superior
kind
of
house
.
There
was
something
pleasantly
unusual
*NL*
about
it
and
about
Ivar
.
``
Do
the
birds
know
you
will
be
kind
to
*NL*
them
,
Ivar
?
Is
that
why
so
many
come
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ivar
sat
down
on
the
floor
and
tucked
his
feet
under
him
.
``
See
,
*NL*
little
brother
,
they
have
come
from
a
long
way
,
and
they
are
very
*NL*
tired
.
From
up
there
where
they
are
flying
,
our
country
looks
dark
*NL*
and
flat
.
They
must
have
water
to
drink
and
to
bathe
in
before
*NL*
they
can
go
on
with
their
journey
.
They
look
this
way
and
that
,
*NL*
and
far
below
them
they
see
something
shining
,
like
a
piece
of
glass
*NL*
set
in
the
dark
earth
.
That
is
my
pond
.
They
come
to
it
and
are
*NL*
not
disturbed
.
Maybe
I
sprinkle
a
little
corn
.
They
tell
the
other
*NL*
birds
,
and
next
year
more
come
this
way
.
They
have
their
roads
up
*NL*
there
,
as
we
have
down
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Emil
rubbed
his
knees
thoughtfully
.
``
And
is
that
true
,
Ivar
,
about
*NL*
the
head
ducks
falling
back
when
they
are
tired
,
and
the
hind
ones
*NL*
taking
their
place
?

*NL*
Alexandra
had
selected
her
hammock
by
the
time
the
boys
came
up
*NL*
from
the
pond
.
They
would
not
come
in
,
but
sat
in
the
shade
of
*NL*
the
bank
outside
while
Alexandra
and
Ivar
talked
about
the
birds
*NL*
and
about
his
housekeeping
,
and
why
he
never
ate
meat
,
fresh
or
*NL*
salt
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alexandra
was
sitting
on
one
of
the
wooden
chairs
,
her
arms
resting
*NL*
on
the
table
.
Ivar
was
sitting
on
the
floor
at
her
feet
.
``
Ivar
,
''
*NL*
she
said
suddenly
,
beginning
to
trace
the
pattern
on
the
oilcloth
*NL*
with
her
forefinger
,
``
I
came
to-day
more
because
I
wanted
to
talk
*NL*
to
you

because
I
wanted
to
buy

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

The
old
man
scraped
his
bare
feet
on
the
plank
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
a
big
bunch
of
hogs

Ivar

I
would
n't
sell
in
the
spring

*NL*
when
everybody
advised
me
to
,
and
now
so
many
people
are
losing
*NL*
their
hogs
that
I
am
frightened
.
What
can
be
done
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ivar
's
little
eyes
began
to
shine
.
They
lost
their
vagueness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
feed
them
swill
and
such
stuff
?
Of
course
!
And
sour
milk
?
*NL*
Oh
,
yes

And
keep
them
in
a
stinking
pen
?
I
tell
you
,
sister
,
*NL*
the
hogs
of
this
country
are
put
upon
!
They
become
unclean
,
like
*NL*
the
hogs
in
the
Bible
.
If
you
kept
your
chickens
like
that
,
what
*NL*
would
happen
?
You
have
a
little
sorghum
patch
,
maybe
?
Put
a
fence
*NL*
around
it

and
turn
the
hogs
in

Build
a
shed
to
give

shade

*NL*
a
thatch
on

Let
the

haul
water
to

clean

Get

off
the
old
stinking
ground

not
let

Give

only
grain

clean
feed

Hogs
do
*NL*
not

to
be
filthy

The
boys
outside
the
door
had
been
listening
.
Lou
nudged
his
*NL*
brother
.
``
Come
,
the
horses
are
done
eating

Let
's
hitch
up
and
*NL*
get
out

'll
fill
her
full
of
notions

She
'll
be
for
*NL*
having
the
pigs
sleep
with
us
,
next
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Oscar
grunted
and
got
up
.
Carl
,
who
could
not
understand
what
Ivar
*NL*
said
,
saw
that
the
two
boys
were
displeased
.
They
did
not
mind
*NL*
hard
work
,
but
they
hated
experiments
and
could
never
see
the
use
*NL*
of
taking
pains
.
Even
Lou
,
who
was
more
elastic
than
his
older
*NL*
brother
,
disliked
to
do
anything
different
from
their
neighbors
.
*NL*
He
felt
that
it
made
them
conspicuous
and
gave
people
a
chance
to
*NL*
talk
about
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Once
they
were
on
the
homeward
road
,
the
boys
forgot
their
ill-humor
*NL*
and
joked
about
Ivar
and
his
birds
.
Alexandra
did
not
propose
any
*NL*
reforms
in
the
care
of
the
pigs
,
and
they
hoped
she
had
forgotten
*NL*
Ivar
's
talk
.
They
agreed
that
he
was
crazier
than
ever
,
and
would
*NL*
never
be
able
to
prove
up
on
his
land
because
he
worked
it
so
little
.
*NL*
Alexandra
privately
resolved
that
she
would
have
a
talk
with
Ivar
*NL*
about
this
and
stir
him
up
.
The
boys
persuaded
Carl
to
stay
for
*NL*
supper
and
go
swimming
in
the
pasture
pond
after
dark
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
evening
,
after
she
had
washed
the
supper
dishes
,
Alexandra
*NL*
sat
down
on
the
kitchen
doorstep
,
while
her
mother
was
mixing
the
*NL*
bread
.
It
was
a
still
,
deep-breathing
summer
night
,
full
of
the
*NL*
smell
of
the
hay
fields
.
Sounds
of
laughter
and
splashing
came
*NL*
up
from
the
pasture
,
and
when
the
moon
rose
rapidly
above
the
bare
*NL*
rim
of
the
prairie
,
the
pond
glittered
like
polished
metal
,
and
*NL*
she
could
see
the
flash
of
white
bodies
as
the
boys
ran
about
the
*NL*
edge
,
or
jumped
into
the
water
.
Alexandra
watched
the
shimmering
*NL*
pool
dreamily
,
but
eventually
her
eyes
went
back
to
the
sorghum
*NL*
patch
south
of
the
barn
,
where
she
was
planning
to
make
her
new
*NL*
pig
corral
.

*NL*
For
the
first
three
years
after
John
Bergson
's
death
,
the
affairs
*NL*
of
his
family
prospered
.
Then
came
the
hard
times
that
brought
*NL*
every
one
on
the
Divide
to
the
brink
of
despair
;
three
years
of
*NL*
drouth
and
failure
,
the
last
struggle
of
a
wild
soil
against
the
*NL*
encroaching
plowshare
.
The
first
of
these
fruitless
summers
the
*NL*
Bergson
boys
bore
courageously
.
The
failure
of
the
corn
crop
made
*NL*
labor
cheap
.
Lou
and
Oscar
hired
two
men
and
put
in
bigger
crops
*NL*
than
ever
before
.
They
lost
everything
they
spent
.
The
whole
*NL*
country
was
discouraged
.
Farmers
who
were
already
in
debt
had
to
*NL*
give
up
their
land
.
A
few
foreclosures
demoralized
the
county
.
*NL*
The
settlers
sat
about
on
the
wooden
sidewalks
in
the
little
town
*NL*
and
told
each
other
that
the
country
was
never
meant
for
men
to
live
*NL*
in
;
the
thing
to
do
was
to
get
back
to
Iowa
,
to
Illinois
,
to
any
*NL*
place
that
had
been
proved
habitable
.
The
Bergson
boys
,
certainly
,
*NL*
would
have
been
happier
with
their
uncle
Otto
,
in
the
bakery
shop
*NL*
in
Chicago
.
Like
most
of
their
neighbors
,
they
were
meant
to
follow
*NL*
in
paths
already
marked
out
for
them
,
not
to
break
trails
in
a
new
*NL*
country
.
A
steady
job
,
a
few
holidays
,
nothing
to
think
about
,
and
*NL*
they
would
have
been
very
happy
.
It
was
no
fault
of
theirs
that
*NL*
they
had
been
dragged
into
the
wilderness
when
they
were
little
*NL*
boys
.
A
pioneer
should
have
imagination
,
should
be
able
to
enjoy
*NL*
the
idea
of
things
more
than
the
things
themselves
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
second
of
these
barren
summers
was
passing
.
One
September
*NL*
afternoon
Alexandra
had
gone
over
to
the
garden
across
the
draw
to
*NL*
dig
sweet
potatoes
--
they
had
been
thriving
upon
the
weather
that
*NL*
was
fatal
to
everything
else
.
But
when
Carl
Linstrum
came
up
the
*NL*
garden
rows
to
find
her
,
she
was
not
working
.
She
was
standing
*NL*
lost
in
thought
,
leaning
upon
her
pitchfork
,
her
sunbonnet
lying
*NL*
beside
her
on
the
ground
.
The
dry
garden
patch
smelled
of
drying
*NL*
vines
and
was
strewn
with
yellow
seed-cucumbers
and
pumpkins
and
*NL*
citrons
.
At
one
end
,
next
the
rhubarb
,
grew
feathery
asparagus
,
*NL*
with
red
berries
.
Down
the
middle
of
the
garden
was
a
row
of
*NL*
gooseberry
and
currant
bushes
.
A
few
tough
zenias
and
marigolds
*NL*
and
a
row
of
scarlet
sage
bore
witness
to
the
buckets
of
water
*NL*
that
Mrs.
Bergson
had
carried
there
after
sundown
,
against
the
*NL*
prohibition
of
her
sons
.
Carl
came
quietly
and
slowly
up
the
garden
*NL*
path
,
looking
intently
at
Alexandra
.
She
did
not
hear
him
.
She
was
*NL*
standing
perfectly
still
,
with
that
serious
ease
so
characteristic
*NL*
of
her
.
Her
thick
,
reddish
braids
,
twisted
about
her
head
,
fairly
*NL*
burned
in
the
sunlight
.
The
air
was
cool
enough
to
make
the
warm
*NL*
sun
pleasant
on
one
's
back
and
shoulders
,
and
so
clear
that
the
*NL*
eye
could
follow
a
hawk
up
and
up
,
into
the
blazing
blue
depths
of
*NL*
the
sky
.
Even
Carl
,
never
a
very
cheerful
boy
,
and
considerably
*NL*
darkened
by
these
last
two
bitter
years
,
loved
the
country
on
days
*NL*
like
this
,
felt
something
strong
and
young
and
wild
come
out
of
*NL*
it
,
that
laughed
at
care
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alexandra
,
''
he
said
as
he
approached
her
,
``
I
want
to
talk
to
you
.
*NL*
Let
's
sit
down
by
the
gooseberry
bushes
.
''
He
picked
up
her
sack
*NL*
of
potatoes
and
they
crossed
the
garden
.
``
Boys
gone
to
town
?
''
he
*NL*
asked
as
he
sank
down
on
the
warm
,
sun-baked
earth
.
``
Well
,
we
have
*NL*
made
up
our
minds
at
last
,
Alexandra
.
We
are
really
going
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
at
him
as
if
she
were
a
little
frightened
.
``
Really
,
*NL*
Carl
?
Is
it
settled
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
father
has
heard
from
St.
Louis
,
and
they
will
give
him
back
*NL*
his
old
job
in
the
cigar
factory
.
He
must
be
there
by
the
first
*NL*
of
November
.
They
are
taking
on
new
men
then
.
We
will
sell
the
*NL*
place
for
whatever
we
can
get
,
and
auction
the
stock
.
We
have
n't
*NL*
enough
to
ship
.
I
am
going
to
learn
engraving
with
a
German
engraver
*NL*
there
,
and
then
try
to
get
work
in
Chicago
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alexandra
's
hands
dropped
in
her
lap
.
Her
eyes
became
dreamy
and
*NL*
filled
with
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carl
's
sensitive
lower
lip
trembled
.
He
scratched
in
the
soft
earth
*NL*
beside
him
with
a
stick
.
``
That
's
all
I
hate
about
it
,
Alexandra
,
''
*NL*
he
said
slowly
.
``
You
've
stood
by
us
through
so
much
and
helped
*NL*
father
out
so
many
times
,
and
now
it
seems
as
if
we
were
running
*NL*
off
and
leaving
you
to
face
the
worst
of
it
.
But
it
is
n't
as
if
*NL*
we
could
really
ever
be
of
any
help
to
you
.
We
are
only
one
more
*NL*
drag
,
one
more
thing
you
look
out
for
and
feel
responsible
for
.
*NL*
Father
was
never
meant
for
a
farmer
,
you
know
that
.
And
I
hate
*NL*
it

We
'd
only
get
in
deeper
and
deeper
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

yes

Carl
,
I
know

You
are
wasting
your
life

nineteen

help
feeling
scared
when
I
think
how
I
will
miss

more

She
brushed
the
tears
from
her
*NL*
cheeks
,
not
trying
to
hide
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
Alexandra

he
said
sadly
and
wistfully
,
``
I
've
never
been
*NL*
any
real
help
to
you

beyond
sometimes
trying
to
keep
the
boys
in
*NL*
a
good
humor

''
*NL*
*NL*
Alexandra
smiled
and
shook
her
head
.
``
Oh
,
it
's
not
that
.
Nothing
*NL*
like
that

It
's
by
understanding
me
,
and
the
boys
,
and
mother
,
*NL*
that
you
've
helped
me

I
expect
that
is
the
only
way
one
person

ever
really
can
help
another

I
think
you
are
about
the
only
one

that
ever
helped

Somehow
it
will
take
more
courage
to
bear
*NL*
your
going
than
everything
that
has
happened
before
.

*NL*
*NL*
Carl
looked
at
the
ground
.
``
You
see
,
we
've
all
depended
so
on
you
,
''
*NL*
he
said
,
``
even
father
.
He
makes
me
laugh
.
When
anything
comes
up
*NL*
he
always
says
,
'
I
wonder
what
the
Bergsons
are
going
to
do
about
*NL*
that
?
I
guess
I
'll
go
and
ask
her
.
'
I
'll
never
forget
that
time
,
*NL*
when
we
first
came
here
,
and
our
horse
had
the
colic
,
and
I
ran
*NL*
over
to
your
place
--
your
father
was
away
,
and
you
came
home
with
me
*NL*
and
showed
father
how
to
let
the
wind
out
of
the
horse
.
You
were
*NL*
only
a
little
girl
then
,
but
you
knew
ever
so
much
more
about
farm
*NL*
work
than
poor
father
.
You
remember
how
homesick
I
used
to
get
,
*NL*
and
what
long
talks
we
used
to
have
coming
from
school
?
We
've
*NL*
someway
always
felt
alike
about
things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
that
's
it

we
've
liked
the
same
things
and
we
've
liked
them
*NL*
together

without
anybody
else
knowing

And
we
've
had
good
times
,
*NL*
hunting
for
Christmas
trees
and
going
for
ducks
and
making
our
plum
*NL*
wine
together
every
year
.
We
've
never
either
of
us
had
any
other
*NL*
close
friend
.
And
now
--
''
Alexandra
wiped
her
eyes
with
the
corner
*NL*
of
her
apron
,
``
and
now
I
must
remember
that
you
are
going
where
*NL*
you
will
have
many
friends
,
and
will
find
the
work
you
were
meant
*NL*
to
do
.
But
you
'll
write
to

Carl

That
will
mean
a
great

here

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
write

cried
the

impetuously

``

I
'll
be
working
for

do
something

He
sat
up
and
frowned
at
the
red
grass

*NL*
*NL*
Alexandra
sighed
.
``
How
discouraged
the
boys
will
be
when

*NL*
hear

home
from
town
discouraged
,
anyway
.
So
*NL*
many
people
are
trying
to
leave
the
country
,
and
they
talk
to
our
*NL*
boys
and
make
them
low-spirited
.
I
'm
afraid
they
are
beginning
to
*NL*
feel
hard
toward
me
because
I
wo
n't
listen
to
any
talk
about
going
.
*NL*
Sometimes
I
feel
like
I
'm
getting
tired
of
standing
up
for
this
*NL*
country
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wo
n't
tell
the
boys
yet
,
if
you
'd
rather
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
'll
tell
them
myself
,
to-night
,
when
they
come
home
.
They
'll
*NL*
be
talking
wild
,
anyway
,
and
no
good
comes
of
keeping
bad
news
.
*NL*
It
's
all
harder
on
them
than
it
is
on
me
.
Lou
wants
to
get
married
,
*NL*
poor
boy
,
and
he
ca
n't
until
times
are
better
.
See
,
there
goes
the
*NL*
sun
,
Carl
.
I
must
be
getting
back
.
Mother
will
want
her
potatoes
.
*NL*
It
's
chilly
already
,
the
moment
the
light
goes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alexandra
rose
and
looked
about
.
A
golden
afterglow
throbbed
in
*NL*
the
west
,
but
the
country
already
looked
empty
and
mournful
.
A
dark
*NL*
moving
mass
came
over
the
western
hill
,
the
Lee
boy
was
bringing
in
*NL*
the
herd
from
the
other
half-section
.
Emil
ran
from
the
windmill
*NL*
to
open
the
corral
gate
.
From
the
log
house
,
on
the
little
rise
*NL*
across
the
draw
,
the
smoke
was
curling
.
The
cattle
lowed
and
*NL*
bellowed
.
In
the
sky
the
pale
half-moon
was
slowly
silvering
.
*NL*
Alexandra
and
Carl
walked
together
down
the
potato
rows
.
``
I
have
*NL*
to
keep
telling
myself
what
is
going
to
happen
,
''
she
said
softly
.
*NL*
``
Since
you
have
been
here
,
ten
years
now
,
I
have
never
really
been
*NL*
lonely
.
But
I
can
remember
what
it
was
like
before
.
Now
I
shall
*NL*
have
nobody
but
Emil
.
But
he
is
my
boy
,
and
he
is
tender-hearted
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
night
,
when
the
boys
were
called
to
supper
,
they
sat
down
*NL*
moodily
.
They
had
worn
their
coats
to
town
,
but
they
ate
in
their
*NL*
striped
shirts
and
suspenders
.
They
were
grown
men
now
,
and
,
as
*NL*
Alexandra
said
,
for
the
last
few
years
they
had
been
growing
more
*NL*
and
more
like
themselves
.
Lou
was
still
the
slighter
of
the
two
,
*NL*
the
quicker
and
more
intelligent
,
but
apt
to
go
off
at
half-cock
.
*NL*
He
had
a
lively
blue
eye
,
a
thin
,
fair
skin
-LRB-
always
burned
red
to
*NL*
the
neckband
of
his
shirt
in
summer
-RRB-
,
stiff
,
yellow
hair
that
would
*NL*
not
lie
down
on
his
head
,
and
a
bristly
little
yellow
mustache
,
*NL*
of
which
he
was
very
proud
.
Oscar
could
not
grow
a
mustache
;
his
*NL*
pale
face
was
as
bare
as
an
egg
,
and
his
white
eyebrows
gave
it
an
*NL*
empty
look
.
He
was
a
man
of
powerful
body
and
unusual
endurance
;
*NL*
the
sort
of
man
you
could
attach
to
a
corn-sheller
as
you
would
*NL*
an
engine
.
He
would
turn
it
all
day
,
without
hurrying
,
without
*NL*
slowing
down
.
But
he
was
as
indolent
of
mind
as
he
was
unsparing
*NL*
of
his
body
.
His
love
of
routine
amounted
to
a
vice
.
He
worked
*NL*
like
an
insect
,
always
doing
the
same
thing
over
in
the
same
way
,
*NL*
regardless
of
whether
it
was
best
or
no
.
He
felt
that
there
was
*NL*
a
sovereign
virtue
in
mere
bodily
toil
,
and
he
rather
liked
to
*NL*
do
things
in
the
hardest
way
.
If
a
field
had
once
been
in
corn
,
*NL*
he
could
n't
bear
to
put
it
into
wheat
.
He
liked
to
begin
his
*NL*
corn-planting
at
the
same
time
every
year
,
whether
the
season
were
*NL*
backward
or
forward
.
He
seemed
to
feel
that
by
his
own
irreproachable
*NL*
regularity
he
would
clear
himself
of
blame
and
reprove
the
weather
.
*NL*
When
the
wheat
crop
failed
,
he
threshed
the
straw
at
a
dead
loss
*NL*
to
demonstrate
how
little
grain
there
was
,
and
thus
prove
his
case
*NL*
against
Providence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lou
,
on
the
other
hand
,
was
fussy
and
flighty
;
always
planned
to
*NL*
get
through
two
days
'
work
in
one
,
and
often
got
only
the
least
*NL*
important
things
done
.
He
liked
to
keep
the
place
up
,
but
he
never
*NL*
got
round
to
doing
odd
jobs
until
he
had
to
neglect
more
pressing
*NL*
work
to
attend
to
them
.
In
the
middle
of
the
wheat
harvest
,
when
*NL*
the
grain
was
over-ripe
and
every
hand
was
needed
,
he
would
stop
*NL*
to
mend
fences
or
to
patch
the
harness
;
then
dash
down
to
the
*NL*
field
and
overwork
and
be
laid
up
in
bed
for
a
week
.
The
two
boys
*NL*
balanced
each
other
,
and
they
pulled
well
together
.
They
had
been
*NL*
good
friends
since
they
were
children
.
One
seldom
went
anywhere
,
*NL*
even
to
town
,
without
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
To-night
,
after
they
sat
down
to
supper
,
Oscar
kept
looking
at
Lou
*NL*
as
if
he
expected
him
to
say
something
,
and
Lou
blinked
his
eyes
*NL*
and
frowned
at
his
plate
.
It
was
Alexandra
herself
who
at
last
*NL*
opened
the
discussion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Linstrums
,
''
she
said
calmly
,
as
she
put
another
plate
of
hot
*NL*
biscuit
on
the
table
,
``
are
going
back
to
St.
Louis
.
The
old
man
*NL*
is
going
to
work
in
the
cigar
factory
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
Lou
plunged
in
.
``
You
see
,
Alexandra
,
everybody
who
can
*NL*
crawl
out
is
going
away
.
There
's
no
use
of
us
trying
to
stick
it
*NL*
out
,
just
to
be
stubborn
.
There
's
something
in
knowing
when
to
*NL*
quit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
do
you
want
to
go
,
Lou
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Any
place
where
things
will
grow
,
''
said
Oscar
grimly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lou
reached
for
a
potato
.
``
Chris
Arnson
has
traded
his
half-section
*NL*
for
a
place
down
on
the
river
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
did
he
trade
with
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Charley
Fuller
,
in
town
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fuller
the
real
estate
man
?
You
see
,
Lou
,
that
Fuller
has
a
head
*NL*
on
him
.
He
's
buying
and
trading
for
every
bit
of
land
he
can
get
*NL*
up
here
.
It
'll
make
him
a
rich
man
,
some
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
rich
now
,
that
's
why
he
can
take
a
chance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
ca
n't
we
?
We
'll
live
longer
than
he
will
.
Some
day
the
land
*NL*
itself
will
be
worth
more
than
all
we
can
ever
raise
on
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lou
laughed
.
``
It
could
be
worth
that
,
and
still
not
be
worth
*NL*
much
.
Why
,
Alexandra
,
you
do
n't
know
what
you
're
talking
about
.
*NL*
Our
place
would
n't
bring
now
what
it
would
six
years
ago
.
The
*NL*
fellows
that
settled
up
here
just
made
a
mistake
.
Now
they
're
*NL*
beginning
to
see
this
high
land
was
n't
never
meant
to
grow
nothing
*NL*
on
,
and
everybody
who
ai
n't
fixed
to
graze
cattle
is
trying
to
*NL*
crawl
out
.
It
's
too
high
to
farm
up
here
.
All
the
Americans
are
*NL*
skinning
out
.
That
man
Percy
Adams
,
north
of
town
,
told
me
that
*NL*
he
was
going
to
let
Fuller
take
his
land
and
stuff
for
four
hundred
*NL*
dollars
and
a
ticket
to
Chicago
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
Fuller
again
!
''
Alexandra
exclaimed
.
``
I
wish
that
man
*NL*
would
take
me
for
a
partner
.
He
's
feathering
his
nest
!
If
only
*NL*
poor
people
could
learn
a
little
from
rich
people
!
But
all
these
*NL*
fellows
who
are
running
off
are
bad
farmers
,
like
poor
Mr.
Linstrum
.
*NL*
They
could
n't
get
ahead
even
in
good
years
,
and
they
all
got
into
*NL*
debt
while
father
was
getting
out
.
I
think
we
ought
to
hold
on
as
*NL*
long
as
we
can
on
father
's
account
.
He
was
so
set
on
keeping
this
*NL*
land
.
He
must
have
seen
harder
times
than
this
,
here
.
How
was
it
*NL*
in
the
early
days
,
mother
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Bergson
was
weeping
quietly
.
These
family
discussions
always
*NL*
depressed
her
,
and
made
her
remember
all
that
she
had
been
torn
*NL*
away
from
.
``
I
do
n't
see
why
the
boys
are
always
taking
on
about
*NL*
going
away
,
''
she
said
,
wiping
her
eyes
.
``
I
do
n't
want
to
move
*NL*
again
;
out
to
some
raw
place
,
maybe
,
where
we
'd
be
worse
off
than
*NL*
we
are
here
,
and
all
to
do
over
again
.
I
wo
n't
move
!
If
the
rest
*NL*
of
you
go
,
I
will
ask
some
of
the
neighbors
to
take
me
in
,
and
stay
*NL*
and
be
buried
by
father
.
I
'm
not
going
to
leave
him
by
himself
*NL*
on
the
prairie
,
for
cattle
to
run
over
.
''
She
began
to
cry
more
*NL*
bitterly
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
boys
looked
angry
.
Alexandra
put
a
soothing
hand
on
her
mother
's
*NL*
shoulder
.
``
There
's
no
question
of
that
,
mother
.
You
do
n't
have
*NL*
to
go
if
you
do
n't
want
to
.
A
third
of
the
place
belongs
to
you
*NL*
by
American
law
,
and
we
ca
n't
sell
without
your
consent
.
We
only
*NL*
want
you
to
advise
us
.
How
did
it
use
to
be
when
you
and
father
*NL*
first
came
?
Was
it
really
as
bad
as
this
,
or
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
worse
!
Much
worse
,
''
moaned
Mrs.
Bergson
.
``
Drouth
,
chince-bugs
,
*NL*
hail
,
everything
!
My
garden
all
cut
to
pieces
like
sauerkraut
.
No
*NL*
grapes
on
the
creek
,
no
nothing
.
The
people
all
lived
just
like
*NL*
coyotes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Oscar
got
up
and
tramped
out
of
the
kitchen
.
Lou
followed
him
.
*NL*
They
felt
that
Alexandra
had
taken
an
unfair
advantage
in
turning
*NL*
their
mother
loose
on
them
.
The
next
morning
they
were
silent
and
*NL*
reserved
.
They
did
not
offer
to
take
the
women
to
church
,
but
went
*NL*
down
to
the
barn
immediately
after
breakfast
and
stayed
there
all
*NL*
day
.
When
Carl
Linstrum
came
over
in
the
afternoon
,
Alexandra
*NL*
winked
to
him
and
pointed
toward
the
barn
.
He
understood
her
and
*NL*
went
down
to
play
cards
with
the
boys
.
They
believed
that
a
very
*NL*
wicked
thing
to
do
on
Sunday
,
and
it
relieved
their
feelings
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alexandra
stayed
in
the
house
.
On
Sunday
afternoon
Mrs.
Bergson
*NL*
always
took
a
nap
,
and
Alexandra
read
.
During
the
week
she
read
*NL*
only
the
newspaper
,
but
on
Sunday
,
and
in
the
long
evenings
of
*NL*
winter
,
she
read
a
good
deal
;
read
a
few
things
over
a
great
many
*NL*
times
.
She
knew
long
portions
of
the
``
Frithjof
Saga
''
by
heart
,
*NL*
and
,
like
most
Swedes
who
read
at
all
,
she
was
fond
of
Longfellow
's
*NL*
verse
,
--
the
ballads
and
the
``
Golden
Legend
''
and
``
The
Spanish
Student
.
''
*NL*
To-day
she
sat
in
the
wooden
rocking-chair
with
the
Swedish
Bible
*NL*
open
on
her
knees
,
but
she
was
not
reading
.
She
was
looking
*NL*
thoughtfully
away
at
the
point
where
the
upland
road
disappeared
*NL*
over
the
rim
of
the
prairie
.
Her
body
was
in
an
attitude
of
perfect
*NL*
repose
,
such
as
it
was
apt
to
take
when
she
was
thinking
earnestly
.
*NL*
Her
mind
was
slow
,
truthful
,
steadfast
.
She
had
not
the
least
*NL*
spark
of
cleverness
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
afternoon
the
sitting-room
was
full
of
quiet
and
sunlight
.
*NL*
Emil
was
making
rabbit
traps
in
the
kitchen
shed
.
The
hens
were
*NL*
clucking
and
scratching
brown
holes
in
the
flower
beds
,
and
the
*NL*
wind
was
teasing
the
prince
's
feather
by
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
evening
Carl
came
in
with
the
boys
to
supper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Emil
,
''
said
Alexandra
,
when
they
were
all
seated
at
the
table
,
*NL*
``
how
would
you
like
to
go
traveling
?
Because
I
am
going
to
take
*NL*
a
trip
,
and
you
can
go
with
me
if
you
want
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
boys
looked
up
in
amazement
;
they
were
always
afraid
of
*NL*
Alexandra
's
schemes
.
Carl
was
interested
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
been
thinking
,
boys
,
''
she
went
on
,
``
that
maybe
I
am
too
set
*NL*
against
making
a
change
.
I
'm
going
to
take
Brigham
and
the
buckboard
*NL*
to-morrow
and
drive
down
to
the
river
country
and
spend
a
few
days
*NL*
looking
over
what
they
've
got
down
there
.
If
I
find
anything
good
,
*NL*
you
boys
can
go
down
and
make
a
trade
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nobody
down
there
will
trade
for
anything
up
here
,
''
said
Oscar
*NL*
gloomily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
just
what
I
want
to
find
out
.
Maybe
they
are
just
as
*NL*
discontented
down
there
as
we
are
up
here
.
Things
away
from
home
*NL*
often
look
better
than
they
are
.
You
know
what
your
Hans
Andersen
*NL*
book
says
,
Carl
,
about
the
Swedes
liking
to
buy
Danish
bread
and
*NL*
the
Danes
liking
to
buy
Swedish
bread
,
because
people
always
think
*NL*
the
bread
of
another
country
is
better
than
their
own
.
Anyway
,
*NL*
I
've
heard
so
much
about
the
river
farms
,
I
wo
n't
be
satisfied
till
*NL*
I
've
seen
for
myself

''
*NL*
*NL*
Lou
fidgeted
.
``
Look

Do
n't
agree
to
anything

Do
n't
let
them
*NL*
fool
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lou
was
apt
to
be
fooled
himself
.
He
had
not
yet
learned
to
keep
*NL*
away
from
the
shell-game
wagons
that
followed
the
circus
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
supper
Lou
put
on
a
necktie
and
went
across
the
fields
to
*NL*
court
Annie
Lee
,
and
Carl
and
Oscar
sat
down
to
a
game
of
checkers
,
*NL*
while
Alexandra
read
``
The
Swiss
Family
Robinson
''
aloud
to
her
mother
*NL*
and
Emil
.
It
was
not
long
before
the
two
boys
at
the
table
neglected
*NL*
their
game
to
listen
.
They
were
all
big
children
together
,
and
they
*NL*
found
the
adventures
of
the
family
in
the
tree
house
so
absorbing
*NL*
that
they
gave
them
their
undivided
attention
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
V
*NL*
*NL*
Alexandra
and
Emil
spent
five
days
down
among
the
river
farms
,
*NL*
driving
up
and
down
the
valley
.
Alexandra
talked
to
the
men
about
*NL*
their
crops
and
to
the
women
about
their
poultry
.
She
spent
a
*NL*
whole
day
with
one
young
farmer
who
had
been
away
at
school
,
and
*NL*
who
was
experimenting
with
a
new
kind
of
clover
hay
.
She
learned
*NL*
a
great
deal
.
As
they
drove
along
,
she
and
Emil
talked
and
planned
.
*NL*
At
last
,
on
the
sixth
day
,
Alexandra
turned
Brigham
's
head
northward
*NL*
and
left
the
river
behind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
nothing
in
it
for
us
down
there
,
Emil
.
There
are
a
few
*NL*
fine
farms
,
but
they
are
owned
by
the
rich
men
in
town
,
and
could
n't
*NL*
be
bought
.
Most
of
the
land
is
rough
and
hilly
.
They
can
always
*NL*
scrape
along
down
there
,
but
they
can
never
do
anything
big
.
Down
*NL*
there
they
have
a
little
certainty
,
but
up
with
us
there
is
a
big
*NL*
chance
.
We
must
have
faith
in
the
high
land
,
Emil
.
I
want
to
hold
*NL*
on
harder
than
ever
,
and
when
you
're
a
man
you
'll
thank
me
.
''
She
*NL*
urged
Brigham
forward
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
road
began
to
climb
the
first
long
swells
of
the
Divide
,
*NL*
Alexandra
hummed
an
old
Swedish
hymn
,
and
Emil
wondered
why
his
*NL*
sister
looked
so
happy
.
Her
face
was
so
radiant
that
he
felt
shy
*NL*
about
asking
her
.
For
the
first
time
,
perhaps
,
since
that
land
*NL*
emerged
from
the
waters
of
geologic
ages
,
a
human
face
was
set
toward
*NL*
it
with
love
and
yearning
.
It
seemed
beautiful
to
her
,
rich
and
*NL*
strong
and
glorious
.
Her
eyes
drank
in
the
breadth
of
it
,
until
*NL*
her
tears
blinded
her
.
Then
the
Genius
of
the
Divide
,
the
great
,
*NL*
free
spirit
which
breathes
across
it
,
must
have
bent
lower
than
*NL*
it
ever
bent
to
a
human
will
before
.
The
history
of
every
country
*NL*
begins
in
the
heart
of
a
man
or
a
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alexandra
reached
home
in
the
afternoon
.
That
evening
she
held
*NL*
a
family
council
and
told
her
brothers
all
that
she
had
seen
and
*NL*
heard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
you
boys
to
go
down
yourselves
and
look
it
over
.
Nothing
*NL*
will
convince
you
like
seeing
with
your
own
eyes
.
The
river
land
*NL*
was
settled
before
this
,
and
so
they
are
a
few
years
ahead
of
us
,
*NL*
and
have
learned
more
about
farming
.
The
land
sells
for
three
*NL*
times
as
much
as
this
,
but
in
five
years
we
will
double
it
.
The
*NL*
rich
men
down
there
own
all
the
best
land
,
and
they
are
buying
*NL*
all
they
can
get
.
The
thing
to
do
is
to
sell
our
cattle
and
what
*NL*
little
old
corn
we
have
,
and
buy
the
Linstrum
place
.
Then
the
next
*NL*
thing
to
do
is
to
take
out
two
loans
on
our
half-sections
,
and
buy
*NL*
Peter
Crow
's
place
;
raise
every
dollar
we
can
,
and
buy
every
acre
*NL*
we
can
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mortgage
the
homestead
again
?
''
Lou
cried
.
He
sprang
up
and
began
*NL*
to
wind
the
clock
furiously
.
``
I
wo
n't
slave
to
pay
off
another
*NL*
mortgage
.
I
'll
never
do
it
.
You
'd
just
as
soon
kill
us
all
,
*NL*
Alexandra
,
to
carry
out
some
scheme
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Oscar
rubbed
his
high
,
pale
forehead
.
``
How
do
you
propose
to
pay
*NL*
off
your
mortgages
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alexandra
looked
from
one
to
the
other
and
bit
her
lip
.
They
had
*NL*
never
seen
her
so
nervous
.
``
See
here
,
''
she
brought
out
at
last
.
*NL*
``
We
borrow
the
money
for
six
years
.
Well
,
with
the
money
we
buy
*NL*
a
half-section
from
Linstrum
and
a
half
from
Crow
,
and
a
quarter
*NL*
from
Struble
,
maybe
.
That
will
give
us
upwards
of
fourteen
hundred
*NL*
acres
,
wo
n't
it
?
You
wo
n't
have
to
pay
off
your
mortgages
for
six
*NL*
years
.
By
that
time
,
any
of
this
land
will
be
worth
thirty
dollars
*NL*
an
acre
--
it
will
be
worth
fifty
,
but
we
'll
say
thirty
;
then
you
*NL*
can
sell
a
garden
patch
anywhere
,
and
pay
off
a
debt
of
sixteen
*NL*
hundred
dollars
.
It
's
not
the
principal
I
'm
worried
about
,
it
's
*NL*
the
interest
and
taxes
.
We
'll
have
to
strain
to
meet
the
payments
.
*NL*
But
as
sure
as
we
are
sitting
here
to-night
,
we
can
sit
down
here
*NL*
ten
years
from
now
independent
landowners
,
not
struggling
farmers
*NL*
any
longer
.
The
chance
that
father
was
always
looking
for
has
*NL*
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lou
was
pacing
the
floor
.
``
But
how
do
you
KNOW
that
land
is
going
*NL*
to
go
up
enough
to
pay
the
mortgages
and
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
make
us
rich
besides
?
''
Alexandra
put
in
firmly
.
``
I
ca
n't
*NL*
explain
that
,
Lou
.
You
'll
have
to
take
my
word
for
it
.
I
KNOW
,
*NL*
that
's
all
.
When
you
drive
about
over
the
country
you
can
feel
it
*NL*
coming

''
*NL*
*NL*
Oscar
had
been
sitting
with
his
head
lowered
,
his
hands
hanging
*NL*
between
his
knees
.
``
But
we
ca
n't
work
so
much
land
,
''
he
said
*NL*
dully
,
as
if
he
were
talking
to
himself
.
``
We
ca
n't
even
try

It
*NL*
would
just
lie
there
and
we
'd
work
ourselves
to
death

He
sighed
,
*NL*
and
laid
his
calloused
fist
on
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alexandra
's
eyes
filled
with
tears
.
She
put
her
hand
on
his
*NL*
shoulder
.
``
You
poor
boy
,
you
wo
n't
have
to
work
it
.
The
men
in
*NL*
town
who
are
buying
up
other
people
's
land
do
n't
try
to
farm
it
.
*NL*
They
are
the
men
to
watch
,
in
a
new
country
.
Let
's
try
to
do
*NL*
like
the
shrewd
ones
,
and
not
like
these
stupid
fellows
.
I
do
n't
*NL*
want
you
boys
always
to
have
to
work
like
this

I
want
you
to
be
*NL*
independent

and
Emil
to
go
to
school

''
*NL*
*NL*
Lou
held
his
head
as
if
it
were
splitting
.
``
Everybody
will
say
we
*NL*
are
crazy

It
must
be
crazy
,
or
everybody
would
be
doing
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
If
they
were
,
we
would
n't
have
much
chance

No
,
Lou
,
I
was
talking
*NL*
about
that
with
the
smart
young
man
who
is
raising
the
new
kind
*NL*
of
clover
.
He
says
the
right
thing
is
usually
just
what
everybody
*NL*
do
n't
do
.
Why
are
we
better
fixed
than
any
of
our
neighbors
?
Because
*NL*
father
had
more
brains
.
Our
people
were
better
people
than
these
*NL*
in
the
old
country
.
We
OUGHT
to
do
more
than
they
do
,
and
see
*NL*
further
ahead
.
Yes
,
mother
,
I
'm
going
to
clear
the
table
now

''
*NL*
*NL*
Alexandra
rose
.
The
boys
went
to
the
stable
to
see
to
the
stock
,
*NL*
and
they
were
gone
a
long
while
.
When
they
came
back
Lou
played
on
*NL*
his
DRAGHARMONIKA
and
Oscar
sat
figuring
at
his
father
's
secretary
*NL*
all
evening
.
They
said
nothing
more
about
Alexandra
's
project
,
*NL*
but
she
felt
sure
now
that
they
would
consent
to
it
.
Just
before
*NL*
bedtime
Oscar
went
out
for
a
pail
of
water
.
When
he
did
not
come
*NL*
back
,
Alexandra
threw
a
shawl
over
her
head
and
ran
down
the
path
*NL*
to
the
windmill
.
She
found
him
sitting
there
with
his
head
in
his
*NL*
hands
,
and
she
sat
down
beside
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
do
anything
you
do
n't
want
to
do
,
Oscar
,
''
she
whispered
.
*NL*
She
waited
a
moment
,
but
he
did
not
stir
.
``
I
wo
n't
say
any
more
*NL*
about
it
,
if
you
'd
rather
not

What
makes
you
so
discouraged
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
dread
signing
my
name
to
them
pieces
of
paper

''
he
said
slowly
.
*NL*
``
All
the
time
I
was
a
boy
we
had
a
mortgage
hanging
over
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
do
n't
sign
one

I
do
n't
want
you
to

if
you
feel
that
way

*NL*
*NL*
Oscar
shook
his
head
.
``
No
,
I
can
see
there
's
a
chance
that
way
.
*NL*
I
've
thought
a
good
while
there
might
be
.
We
're
in
so
deep
now
,
we
*NL*
might
as
well
go
deeper
.
But
it
's
hard
work
pulling
out
of
debt
.
*NL*
Like
pulling
a
threshing-machine
out
of
the
mud
;
breaks
your
back
.
*NL*
Me
and
Lou
's
worked
hard
,
and
I
ca
n't
see
it
's
got
us
ahead
much

*NL*
*NL*
``
Nobody
knows
about
that
as
well
as
I
do

Oscar
.
That
's
why
I
want
*NL*
to
try
an
easier
way
.
I
do
n't
want
you
to
have
to
grub
for
every
*NL*
dollar
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
know
what
you
mean

Maybe
it
'll
come
out
right
.
But
signing
*NL*
papers
is
signing
papers
.
There
ai
n't
no
maybe
about
that
.
''
He
*NL*
took
his
pail
and
trudged
up
the
path
to
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alexandra
drew
her
shawl
closer
about
her
and
stood
leaning
against
*NL*
the
frame
of
the
mill
,
looking
at
the
stars
which
glittered
so
*NL*
keenly
through
the
frosty
autumn
air
.
She
always
loved
to
watch
*NL*
them
,
to
think
of
their
vastness
and
distance
,
and
of
their
ordered
*NL*
march
.
It
fortified
her
to
reflect
upon
the
great
operations
*NL*
of
nature
,
and
when
she
thought
of
the
law
that
lay
behind
them
,
*NL*
she
felt
a
sense
of
personal
security
.
That
night
she
had
a
new
*NL*
consciousness
of
the
country
,
felt
almost
a
new
relation
to
it
.
*NL*
Even
her
talk
with
the
boys
had
not
taken
away
the
feeling
that
had
*NL*
overwhelmed
her
when
she
drove
back
to
the
Divide
that
afternoon
.
*NL*
She
had
never
known
before
how
much
the
country
meant
to
her
.
The
*NL*
chirping
of
the
insects
down
in
the
long
grass
had
been
like
the
*NL*
sweetest
music
.
She
had
felt
as
if
her
heart
were
hiding
down
*NL*
there
,
somewhere
,
with
the
quail
and
the
plover
and
all
the
little
*NL*
wild
things
that
crooned
or
buzzed
in
the
sun
.
Under
the
long
*NL*
shaggy
ridges
,
she
felt
the
future
stirring
.

*NL*
IT
is
sixteen
years
since
John
Bergson
died
.
His
wife
now
lies
*NL*
beside
him
,
and
the
white
shaft
that
marks
their
graves
gleams
*NL*
across
the
wheat-fields
.
Could
he
rise
from
beneath
it
,
he
would
*NL*
not
know
the
country
under
which
he
has
been
asleep
.
The
shaggy
coat
*NL*
of
the
prairie
,
which
they
lifted
to
make
him
a
bed
,
has
vanished
*NL*
forever
.
From
the
Norwegian
graveyard
one
looks
out
over
a
vast
*NL*
checker-board
,
marked
off
in
squares
of
wheat
and
corn
;
light
and
*NL*
dark
,
dark
and
light
.
Telephone
wires
hum
along
the
white
roads
,
*NL*
which
always
run
at
right
angles
.
From
the
graveyard
gate
one
can
*NL*
count
a
dozen
gayly
painted
farmhouses
;
the
gilded
weather-vanes
*NL*
on
the
big
red
barns
wink
at
each
other
across
the
green
and
brown
*NL*
and
yellow
fields
.
The
light
steel
windmills
tremble
throughout
*NL*
their
frames
and
tug
at
their
moorings
,
as
they
vibrate
in
the
wind
*NL*
that
often
blows
from
one
week
's
end
to
another
across
that
high
,
*NL*
active
,
resolute
stretch
of
country
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Divide
is
now
thickly
populated
.
The
rich
soil
yields
heavy
*NL*
harvests
;
the
dry
,
bracing
climate
and
the
smoothness
of
the
land
*NL*
make
labor
easy
for
men
and
beasts
.
There
are
few
scenes
more
*NL*
gratifying
than
a
spring
plowing
in
that
country
,
where
the
furrows
*NL*
of
a
single
field
often
lie
a
mile
in
length
,
and
the
brown
earth
,
*NL*
with
such
a
strong
,
clean
smell
,
and
such
a
power
of
growth
and
*NL*
fertility
in
it
,
yields
itself
eagerly
to
the
plow
;
rolls
away
*NL*
from
the
shear
,
not
even
dimming
the
brightness
of
the
metal
,
with
*NL*
a
soft
,
deep
sigh
of
happiness
.
The
wheat-cutting
sometimes
goes
*NL*
on
all
night
as
well
as
all
day
,
and
in
good
seasons
there
are
*NL*
scarcely
men
and
horses
enough
to
do
the
harvesting
.
The
grain
is
*NL*
so
heavy
that
it
bends
toward
the
blade
and
cuts
like
velvet
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
something
frank
and
joyous
and
young
in
the
open
face
*NL*
of
the
country
.
It
gives
itself
ungrudgingly
to
the
moods
of
the
*NL*
season
,
holding
nothing
back
.
Like
the
plains
of
Lombardy
,
it
*NL*
seems
to
rise
a
little
to
meet
the
sun
.
The
air
and
the
earth
are
*NL*
curiously
mated
and
intermingled
,
as
if
the
one
were
the
breath
*NL*
of
the
other
.
You
feel
in
the
atmosphere
the
same
tonic
,
puissant
*NL*
quality
that
is
in
the
tilth
,
the
same
strength
and
resoluteness
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
June
morning
a
young
man
stood
at
the
gate
of
the
Norwegian
*NL*
graveyard
,
sharpening
his
scythe
in
strokes
unconsciously
timed
to
*NL*
the
tune
he
was
whistling
.
He
wore
a
flannel
cap
and
duck
trousers
,
*NL*
and
the
sleeves
of
his
white
flannel
shirt
were
rolled
back
to
*NL*
the
elbow
.
When
he
was
satisfied
with
the
edge
of
his
blade
,
he
*NL*
slipped
the
whetstone
into
his
hip
pocket
and
began
to
swing
his
*NL*
scythe
,
still
whistling
,
but
softly
,
out
of
respect
to
the
quiet
*NL*
folk
about
him
.
Unconscious
respect
,
probably
,
for
he
seemed
*NL*
intent
upon
his
own
thoughts
,
and
,
like
the
Gladiator
's
,
they
were
*NL*
far
away
.
He
was
a
splendid
figure
of
a
boy
,
tall
and
straight
*NL*
as
a
young
pine
tree
,
with
a
handsome
head
,
and
stormy
gray
eyes
,
*NL*
deeply
set
under
a
serious
brow
.
The
space
between
his
two
front
*NL*
teeth
,
which
were
unusually
far
apart
,
gave
him
the
proficiency
*NL*
in
whistling
for
which
he
was
distinguished
at
college
.
-LRB-
He
also
*NL*
played
the
cornet
in
the
University
band
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
grass
required
his
close
attention
,
or
when
he
had
to
*NL*
stoop
to
cut
about
a
head-stone
,
he
paused
in
his
lively
air
,
--
the
*NL*
``
Jewel
''
song
,
--
taking
it
up
where
he
had
left
it
when
his
scythe
*NL*
swung
free
again
.
He
was
not
thinking
about
the
tired
pioneers
*NL*
over
whom
his
blade
glittered
.
The
old
wild
country
,
the
struggle
*NL*
in
which
his
sister
was
destined
to
succeed
while
so
many
men
broke
*NL*
their
hearts
and
died
,
he
can
scarcely
remember
.
That
is
all
among
*NL*
the
dim
things
of
childhood
and
has
been
forgotten
in
the
brighter
*NL*
pattern
life
weaves
to-day
,
in
the
bright
facts
of
being
captain
*NL*
of
the
track
team
,
and
holding
the
interstate
record
for
the
high
*NL*
jump
,
in
the
all-suffusing
brightness
of
being
twenty-one
.
Yet
*NL*
sometimes
,
in
the
pauses
of
his
work
,
the
young
man
frowned
and
*NL*
looked
at
the
ground
with
an
intentness
which
suggested
that
even
*NL*
twenty-one
might
have
its
problems
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
had
been
mowing
the
better
part
of
an
hour
,
he
heard
the
*NL*
rattle
of
a
light
cart
on
the
road
behind
him
.
Supposing
that
it
*NL*
was
his
sister
coming
back
from
one
of
her
farms
,
he
kept
on
with
*NL*
his
work
.
The
cart
stopped
at
the
gate
and
a
merry
contralto
voice
*NL*
called
,
``
Almost
through
,
Emil
?
''
He
dropped
his
scythe
and
went
*NL*
toward
the
fence
,
wiping
his
face
and
neck
with
his
handkerchief
.
*NL*
In
the
cart
sat
a
young
woman
who
wore
driving
gauntlets
and
a
wide
*NL*
shade
hat
,
trimmed
with
red
poppies
.
Her
face
,
too
,
was
rather
*NL*
like
a
poppy
,
round
and
brown
,
with
rich
color
in
her
cheeks
and
*NL*
lips
,
and
her
dancing
yellow-brown
eyes
bubbled
with
gayety
.
The
*NL*
wind
was
flapping
her
big
hat
and
teasing
a
curl
of
her
chestnut-colored
*NL*
hair
.
She
shook
her
head
at
the
tall
youth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
time
did
you
get
over
here
?
That
's
not
much
of
a
job
for
*NL*
an
athlete
.
Here
I
've
been
to
town
and
back
.
Alexandra
lets
you
*NL*
sleep
late
.
Oh
,
I
know
!
Lou
's
wife
was
telling
me
about
the
way
*NL*
she
spoils
you
.
I
was
going
to
give
you
a
lift
,
if
you
were
done
.
''
*NL*
She
gathered
up
her
reins
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
will
be
,
in
a
minute
.
Please
wait
for
me
,
Marie
,
''
Emil
*NL*
coaxed
.
``
Alexandra
sent
me
to
mow
our
lot
,
but
I
've
done
half
a
*NL*
dozen
others
,
you
see
.
Just
wait
till
I
finish
off
the
Kourdnas
'
.
*NL*
By
the
way
,
they
were
Bohemians
.
Why
are
n't
they
up
in
the
Catholic
*NL*
graveyard
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Free-thinkers
,
''
replied
the
young
woman
laconically
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lots
of
the
Bohemian
boys
at
the
University
are
,
''
said
Emil
,
taking
*NL*
up
his
scythe
again
.
``
What
did
you
ever
burn
John
Huss
for
,
anyway
?
*NL*
It
's
made
an
awful
row
.
They
still
jaw
about
it
in
history
classes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
'd
do
it
right
over
again
,
most
of
us
,
''
said
the
young
woman
*NL*
hotly
.
``
Do
n't
they
ever
teach
you
in
your
history
classes
that
*NL*
you
'd
all
be
heathen
Turks
if
it
had
n't
been
for
the
Bohemians
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Emil
had
fallen
to
mowing
.
``
Oh
,
there
's
no
denying
you
're
a
spunky
*NL*
little
bunch
,
you
Czechs
,
''
he
called
back
over
his
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marie
Shabata
settled
herself
in
her
seat
and
watched
the
rhythmical
*NL*
movement
of
the
young
man
's
long
arms
,
swinging
her
foot
as
if
*NL*
in
time
to
some
air
that
was
going
through
her
mind
.
The
minutes
*NL*
passed
.
Emil
mowed
vigorously
and
Marie
sat
sunning
herself
and
*NL*
watching
the
long
grass
fall
.
She
sat
with
the
ease
that
belongs
*NL*
to
persons
of
an
essentially
happy
nature
,
who
can
find
a
comfortable
*NL*
spot
almost
anywhere
;
who
are
supple
,
and
quick
in
adapting
themselves
*NL*
to
circumstances
.
After
a
final
swish
,
Emil
snapped
the
gate
and
*NL*
sprang
into
the
cart
,
holding
his
scythe
well
out
over
the
wheel
.
*NL*
``
There
,
''
he
sighed
.
``
I
gave
old
man
Lee
a
cut
or
so
,
too
.
Lou
's
*NL*
wife
need
n't
talk
.
I
never
see
Lou
's
scythe
over
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marie
clucked
to
her
horse
.
``
Oh
,
you
know
Annie
!
''
She
looked
at
*NL*
the
young
man
's
bare
arms
.
``
How
brown
you
've
got
since
you
came
*NL*
home
.
I
wish
I
had
an
athlete
to
mow
my
orchard
.
I
get
wet
to
my
*NL*
knees
when
I
go
down
to
pick
cherries
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
have
one
,
any
time
you
want
him
.
Better
wait
until
after
*NL*
it
rains
.
''
Emil
squinted
off
at
the
horizon
as
if
he
were
looking
*NL*
for
clouds
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
?
Oh
,
there
's
a
good
boy
!
''
She
turned
her
head
to
him
*NL*
with
a
quick
,
bright
smile
.
He
felt
it
rather
than
saw
it
.
Indeed
,
*NL*
he
had
looked
away
with
the
purpose
of
not
seeing
it
.
``
I
've
been
*NL*
up
looking
at
Angelique
's
wedding
clothes
,
''
Marie
went
on
,
``
and
*NL*
I
'm
so
excited
I
can
hardly
wait
until
Sunday
.
Amedee
will
be
*NL*
a
handsome
bridegroom
.
Is
anybody
but
you
going
to
stand
up
with
*NL*
him
?
Well
,
then
it
will
be
a
handsome
wedding
party
.
''
She
made
a
*NL*
droll
face
at
Emil
,
who
flushed
.
``
Frank
,
''
Marie
continued
,
flicking
*NL*
her
horse
,
``
is
cranky
at
me
because
I
loaned
his
saddle
to
Jan
*NL*
Smirka
,
and
I
'm
terribly
afraid
he
wo
n't
take
me
to
the
dance
in
*NL*
the
evening
.
Maybe
the
supper
will
tempt
him
.
All
Angelique
's
*NL*
folks
are
baking
for
it
,
and
all
Amedee
's
twenty
cousins
.
There
*NL*
will
be
barrels
of
beer
.
If
once
I
get
Frank
to
the
supper
,
I
'll
*NL*
see
that
I
stay
for
the
dance
.
And
by
the
way
,
Emil
,
you
must
n't
*NL*
dance
with
me
but
once
or
twice
.
You
must
dance
with
all
the
French
*NL*
girls
.
It
hurts
their
feelings
if
you
do
n't
.
They
think
you
're
*NL*
proud
because
you
've
been
away
to
school
or
something
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Emil
sniffed
.
``
How
do
you
know
they
think
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
did
n't
dance
with
them
much
at
Raoul
Marcel
's
party
,
and
*NL*
I
could
tell
how
they
took
it
by
the
way
they
looked
at
you
--
and
*NL*
at
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
''
said
Emil
shortly
,
studying
the
glittering
blade
of
*NL*
his
scythe
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
drove
westward
toward
Norway
Creek
,
and
toward
a
big
white
*NL*
house
that
stood
on
a
hill
,
several
miles
across
the
fields
.
There
*NL*
were
so
many
sheds
and
outbuildings
grouped
about
it
that
the
*NL*
place
looked
not
unlike
a
tiny
village
.
A
stranger
,
approaching
*NL*
it
,
could
not
help
noticing
the
beauty
and
fruitfulness
of
the
*NL*
outlying
fields
.
There
was
something
individual
about
the
great
*NL*
farm
,
a
most
unusual
trimness
and
care
for
detail
.
On
either
side
*NL*
of
the
road
,
for
a
mile
before
you
reached
the
foot
of
the
hill
,
*NL*
stood
tall
osage
orange
hedges
,
their
glossy
green
marking
off
*NL*
the
yellow
fields
.
South
of
the
hill
,
in
a
low
,
sheltered
swale
,
*NL*
surrounded
by
a
mulberry
hedge
,
was
the
orchard
,
its
fruit
trees
*NL*
knee-deep
in
timothy
grass
.
Any
one
thereabouts
would
have
told
*NL*
you
that
this
was
one
of
the
richest
farms
on
the
Divide
,
and
that
*NL*
the
farmer
was
a
woman
,
Alexandra
Bergson
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
you
go
up
the
hill
and
enter
Alexandra
's
big
house
,
you
will
*NL*
find
that
it
is
curiously
unfinished
and
uneven
in
comfort
.
One
*NL*
room
is
papered
,
carpeted
,
over-furnished
;
the
next
is
almost
*NL*
bare
.
The
pleasantest
rooms
in
the
house
are
the
kitchen
--
where
*NL*
Alexandra
's
three
young
Swedish
girls
chatter
and
cook
and
pickle
*NL*
and
preserve
all
summer
long
--
and
the
sitting-room
,
in
which
*NL*
Alexandra
has
brought
together
the
old
homely
furniture
that
the
*NL*
Bergsons
used
in
their
first
log
house
,
the
family
portraits
,
and
*NL*
the
few
things
her
mother
brought
from
Sweden
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
you
go
out
of
the
house
into
the
flower
garden
,
there
you
feel
*NL*
again
the
order
and
fine
arrangement
manifest
all
over
the
great
*NL*
farm
;
in
the
fencing
and
hedging
,
in
the
windbreaks
and
sheds
,
in
*NL*
the
symmetrical
pasture
ponds
,
planted
with
scrub
willows
to
give
*NL*
shade
to
the
cattle
in
fly-time
.
There
is
even
a
white
row
of
*NL*
beehives
in
the
orchard
,
under
the
walnut
trees
.
You
feel
that
,
*NL*
properly
,
Alexandra
's
house
is
the
big
out-of-doors
,
and
that
it
*NL*
is
in
the
soil
that
she
expresses
herself
best
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
II
*NL*
*NL*
Emil
reached
home
a
little
past
noon
,
and
when
he
went
into
the
*NL*
kitchen
Alexandra
was
already
seated
at
the
head
of
the
long
table
,
*NL*
having
dinner
with
her
men
,
as
she
always
did
unless
there
were
*NL*
visitors
.
He
slipped
into
his
empty
place
at
his
sister
's
right
.
*NL*
The
three
pretty
young
Swedish
girls
who
did
Alexandra
's
housework
*NL*
were
cutting
pies
,
refilling
coffeecups
,
placing
platters
of
bread
*NL*
and
meat
and
potatoes
upon
the
red
tablecloth
,
and
continually
*NL*
getting
in
each
other
's
way
between
the
table
and
the
stove
.
To
be
*NL*
sure
they
always
wasted
a
good
deal
of
time
getting
in
each
other
's
*NL*
way
and
giggling
at
each
other
's
mistakes
.
But
,
as
Alexandra
had
*NL*
pointedly
told
her
sisters-in-law
,
it
was
to
hear
them
giggle
that
*NL*
she
kept
three
young
things
in
her
kitchen
;
the
work
she
could
*NL*
do
herself
,
if
it
were
necessary
.
These
girls
,
with
their
long
*NL*
letters
from
home
,
their
finery
,
and
their
love-affairs
,
afforded
*NL*
her
a
great
deal
of
entertainment
,
and
they
were
company
for
her
*NL*
when
Emil
was
away
at
school
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
the
youngest
girl
,
Signa
,
who
has
a
pretty
figure
,
mottled
pink
*NL*
cheeks
,
and
yellow
hair
,
Alexandra
is
very
fond
,
though
she
keeps
*NL*
a
sharp
eye
upon
her
.
Signa
is
apt
to
be
skittish
at
mealtime
,
when
*NL*
the
men
are
about
,
and
to
spill
the
coffee
or
upset
the
cream
.
It
*NL*
is
supposed
that
Nelse
Jensen
,
one
of
the
six
men
at
the
dinner-table
,
*NL*
is
courting
Signa
,
though
he
has
been
so
careful
not
to
commit
*NL*
himself
that
no
one
in
the
house
,
least
of
all
Signa
,
can
tell
*NL*
just
how
far
the
matter
has
progressed
.
Nelse
watches
her
glumly
*NL*
as
she
waits
upon
the
table
,
and
in
the
evening
he
sits
on
a
bench
*NL*
behind
the
stove
with
his
DRAGHARMONIKA
,
playing
mournful
airs
*NL*
and
watching
her
as
she
goes
about
her
work
.
When
Alexandra
asked
*NL*
Signa
whether
she
thought
Nelse
was
in
earnest
,
the
poor
child
hid
*NL*
her
hands
under
her
apron
and
murmured
,
``
I
do
n't
know
,
ma
'm
.
But
*NL*
he
scolds
me
about
everything
,
like
as
if
he
wanted
to
have
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
Alexandra
's
left
sat
a
very
old
man
,
barefoot
and
wearing
a
long
*NL*
blue
blouse
,
open
at
the
neck
.
His
shaggy
head
is
scarcely
whiter
*NL*
than
it
was
sixteen
years
ago
,
but
his
little
blue
eyes
have
become
*NL*
pale
and
watery
,
and
his
ruddy
face
is
withered
,
like
an
apple
that
*NL*
has
clung
all
winter
to
the
tree
.
When
Ivar
lost
his
land
through
*NL*
mismanagement
a
dozen
years
ago
,
Alexandra
took
him
in
,
and
he
has
*NL*
been
a
member
of
her
household
ever
since
.
He
is
too
old
to
work
*NL*
in
the
fields
,
but
he
hitches
and
unhitches
the
work-teams
and
*NL*
looks
after
the
health
of
the
stock
.
Sometimes
of
a
winter
evening
*NL*
Alexandra
calls
him
into
the
sitting-room
to
read
the
Bible
aloud
*NL*
to
her
,
for
he
still
reads
very
well
.
He
dislikes
human
habitations
,
*NL*
so
Alexandra
has
fitted
him
up
a
room
in
the
barn
,
where
he
is
very
*NL*
comfortable
,
being
near
the
horses
and
,
as
he
says
,
further
from
*NL*
temptations
.
No
one
has
ever
found
out
what
his
temptations
are
.
*NL*
In
cold
weather
he
sits
by
the
kitchen
fire
and
makes
hammocks
*NL*
or
mends
harness
until
it
is
time
to
go
to
bed
.
Then
he
says
his
*NL*
prayers
at
great
length
behind
the
stove
,
puts
on
his
buffalo-skin
*NL*
coat
and
goes
out
to
his
room
in
the
barn
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alexandra
herself
has
changed
very
little
.
Her
figure
is
fuller
,
*NL*
and
she
has
more
color
.
She
seems
sunnier
and
more
vigorous
than
*NL*
she
did
as
a
young
girl
.
But
she
still
has
the
same
calmness
and
*NL*
deliberation
of
manner
,
the
same
clear
eyes
,
and
she
still
wears
*NL*
her
hair
in
two
braids
wound
round
her
head
.
It
is
so
curly
that
*NL*
fiery
ends
escape
from
the
braids
and
make
her
head
look
like
one
*NL*
of
the
big
double
sunflowers
that
fringe
her
vegetable
garden
.
*NL*
Her
face
is
always
tanned
in
summer
,
for
her
sunbonnet
is
oftener
*NL*
on
her
arm
than
on
her
head
.
But
where
her
collar
falls
away
from
*NL*
her
neck
,
or
where
her
sleeves
are
pushed
back
from
her
wrist
,
the
*NL*
skin
is
of
such
smoothness
and
whiteness
as
none
but
Swedish
women
*NL*
ever
possess
;
skin
with
the
freshness
of
the
snow
itself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alexandra
did
not
talk
much
at
the
table
,
but
she
encouraged
her
*NL*
men
to
talk
,
and
she
always
listened
attentively
,
even
when
they
*NL*
seemed
to
be
talking
foolishly
.
*NL*
*NL*
To-day
Barney
Flinn
,
the
big
red-headed
Irishman
who
had
been
with
*NL*
Alexandra
for
five
years
and
who
was
actually
her
foreman
,
though
*NL*
he
had
no
such
title
,
was
grumbling
about
the
new
silo
she
had
put
*NL*
up
that
spring
.
It
happened
to
be
the
first
silo
on
the
Divide
,
*NL*
and
Alexandra
's
neighbors
and
her
men
were
skeptical
about
it
.
``
To
*NL*
be
sure
,
if
the
thing
do
n't
work
,
we
'll
have
plenty
of
feed
without
*NL*
it
,
indeed
,
''
Barney
conceded
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nelse
Jensen
,
Signa
's
gloomy
suitor
,
had
his
word
.
``
Lou
,
he
says
*NL*
he
would
n't
have
no
silo
on
his
place
if
you
'd
give
it
to
him
.
*NL*
He
says
the
feed
outen
it
gives
the
stock
the
bloat
.
He
heard
of
*NL*
somebody
lost
four
head
of
horses
,
feedin
'
'em
that
stuff
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alexandra
looked
down
the
table
from
one
to
another
.
``
Well
,
*NL*
the
only
way
we
can
find
out
is
to
try
.
Lou
and
I
have
different
*NL*
notions
about
feeding
stock
,
and
that
's
a
good
thing
.
It
's
bad
if
*NL*
all
the
members
of
a
family
think
alike
.
They
never
get
anywhere
.
*NL*
Lou
can
learn
by
my
mistakes
and
I
can
learn
by
his
.
Is
n't
that
*NL*
fair
,
Barney
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Irishman
laughed
.
He
had
no
love
for
Lou
,
who
was
always
uppish
*NL*
with
him
and
who
said
that
Alexandra
paid
her
hands
too
much
.
``
I
've
*NL*
no
thought
but
to
give
the
thing
an
honest
try
,
mum
.
'
T
would
be
*NL*
only
right
,
after
puttin
'
so
much
expense
into
it
.
Maybe
Emil
will
*NL*
come
out
an
'
have
a
look
at
it
wid
me
.
''
He
pushed
back
his
chair
,
*NL*
took
his
hat
from
the
nail
,
and
marched
out
with
Emil
,
who
,
with
*NL*
his
university
ideas
,
was
supposed
to
have
instigated
the
silo
.
*NL*
The
other
hands
followed
them
,
all
except
old
Ivar
.
He
had
been
*NL*
depressed
throughout
the
meal
and
had
paid
no
heed
to
the
talk
of
*NL*
the
men
,
even
when
they
mentioned
cornstalk
bloat
,
upon
which
he
*NL*
was
sure
to
have
opinions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
want
to
speak
to
me
,
Ivar
?
''
Alexandra
asked
as
she
rose
*NL*
from
the
table
.
``
Come
into
the
sitting-room
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
man
followed
Alexandra
,
but
when
she
motioned
him
to
a
chair
*NL*
he
shook
his
head
.
She
took
up
her
workbasket
and
waited
for
him
*NL*
to
speak
.
He
stood
looking
at
the
carpet
,
his
bushy
head
bowed
,
*NL*
his
hands
clasped
in
front
of
him
.
Ivar
's
bandy
legs
seemed
to
*NL*
have
grown
shorter
with
years
,
and
they
were
completely
misfitted
*NL*
to
his
broad
,
thick
body
and
heavy
shoulders
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Ivar
,
what
is
it
?
''
Alexandra
asked
after
she
had
waited
*NL*
longer
than
usual
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ivar
had
never
learned
to
speak
English
and
his
Norwegian
was
quaint
*NL*
and
grave
,
like
the
speech
of
the
more
old-fashioned
people
.
He
*NL*
always
addressed
Alexandra
in
terms
of
the
deepest
respect
,
hoping
*NL*
to
set
a
good
example
to
the
kitchen
girls
,
whom
he
thought
too
*NL*
familiar
in
their
manners
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mistress
,
''
he
began
faintly
,
without
raising
his
eyes
,
``
the
folk
*NL*
have
been
looking
coldly
at
me
of
late
.
You
know
there
has
been
*NL*
talk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Talk
about
what
,
Ivar
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
About
sending
me
away
;
to
the
asylum
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alexandra
put
down
her
sewing-basket
.
``
Nobody
has
come
to
me
with
*NL*
such
talk
,
''
she
said
decidedly
.
``
Why
need
you
listen
?
You
know
*NL*
I
would
never
consent
to
such
a
thing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ivar
lifted
his
shaggy
head
and
looked
at
her
out
of
his
little
*NL*
eyes
.
``
They
say
that
you
can
not
prevent
it
if
the
folk
complain
of
*NL*
me
,
if
your
brothers
complain
to
the
authorities
.
They
say
that
*NL*
your
brothers
are
afraid
--
God
forbid
!
--
that
I
may
do
you
some
*NL*
injury
when
my
spells
are
on
me
.
Mistress
,
how
can
any
one
think
*NL*
that
?
--
that
I
could
bite
the
hand
that
fed
me
!
''
The
tears
trickled
*NL*
down
on
the
old
man
's
beard
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alexandra
frowned
.
``
Ivar
,
I
wonder
at
you
,
that
you
should
come
*NL*
bothering
me
with
such
nonsense
.
I
am
still
running
my
own
house
,
*NL*
and
other
people
have
nothing
to
do
with
either
you
or
me
.
So
long
*NL*
as
I
am
suited
with
you
,
there
is
nothing
to
be
said
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ivar
pulled
a
red
handkerchief
out
of
the
breast
of
his
blouse
and
*NL*
wiped
his
eyes
and
beard
.
``
But
I
should
not
wish
you
to
keep
me
*NL*
if
,
as
they
say
,
it
is
against
your
interests
,
and
if
it
is
hard
*NL*
for
you
to
get
hands
because
I
am
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alexandra
made
an
impatient
gesture
,
but
the
old
man
put
out
his
*NL*
hand
and
went
on
earnestly
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
,
mistress
,
it
is
right
that
you
should
take
these
things
*NL*
into
account
.
You
know
that
my
spells
come
from
God
,
and
that
*NL*
I
would
not
harm
any
living
creature
.
You
believe
that
every
one
*NL*
should
worship
God
in
the
way
revealed
to
him
.
But
that
is
not
*NL*
the
way
of
this
country
.
The
way
here
is
for
all
to
do
alike
.
I
*NL*
am
despised
because
I
do
not
wear
shoes
,
because
I
do
not
cut
my
*NL*
hair
,
and
because
I
have
visions
.
At
home
,
in
the
old
country
,
*NL*
there
were
many
like
me
,
who
had
been
touched
by
God
,
or
who
had
*NL*
seen
things
in
the
graveyard
at
night
and
were
different
afterward
.
*NL*
We
thought
nothing
of
it
,
and
let
them
alone
.
But
here
,
if
a
man
*NL*
is
different
in
his
feet
or
in
his
head
,
they
put
him
in
the
asylum
.
*NL*
Look
at
Peter
Kralik
;
when
he
was
a
boy
,
drinking
out
of
a
creek
,
*NL*
he
swallowed
a
snake
,
and
always
after
that
he
could
eat
only
*NL*
such
food
as
the
creature
liked
,
for
when
he
ate
anything
else
,
it
*NL*
became
enraged
and
gnawed
him
.
When
he
felt
it
whipping
about
in
*NL*
him
,
he
drank
alcohol
to
stupefy
it
and
get
some
ease
for
himself
.
*NL*
He
could
work
as
good
as
any
man
,
and
his
head
was
clear
,
but
they
*NL*
locked
him
up
for
being
different
in
his
stomach
.
That
is
the
way
;
*NL*
they
have
built
the
asylum
for
people
who
are
different
,
and
they
*NL*
will
not
even
let
us
live
in
the
holes
with
the
badgers
.
Only
*NL*
your
great
prosperity
has
protected
me
so
far
.
If
you
had
had
*NL*
ill-fortune
,
they
would
have
taken
me
to
Hastings
long
ago
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
Ivar
talked
,
his
gloom
lifted
.
Alexandra
had
found
that
she
*NL*
could
often
break
his
fasts
and
long
penances
by
talking
to
him
*NL*
and
letting
him
pour
out
the
thoughts
that
troubled
him
.
Sympathy
*NL*
always
cleared
his
mind
,
and
ridicule
was
poison
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
a
great
deal
in
what
you
say
,
Ivar
.
Like
as
not
they
*NL*
will
be
wanting
to
take
me
to
Hastings
because
I
have
built
a
silo
;
*NL*
and
then
I
may
take
you
with
me
.
But
at
present
I
need
you
here
.
*NL*
Only
do
n't
come
to
me
again
telling
me
what
people
say
.
Let
people
*NL*
go
on
talking
as
they
like
,
and
we
will
go
on
living
as
we
think
*NL*
best
.
You
have
been
with
me
now
for
twelve
years
,
and
I
have
gone
*NL*
to
you
for
advice
oftener
than
I
have
ever
gone
to
any
one
.
That
*NL*
ought
to
satisfy
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ivar
bowed
humbly
.
``
Yes
,
mistress
,
I
shall
not
trouble
you
with
*NL*
their
talk
again
.
And
as
for
my
feet
,
I
have
observed
your
wishes
*NL*
all
these
years
,
though
you
have
never
questioned
me
;
washing
them
*NL*
every
night
,
even
in
winter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alexandra
laughed
.
``
Oh
,
never
mind
about
your
feet
,
Ivar
.
We
can
*NL*
remember
when
half
our
neighbors
went
barefoot
in
summer
.
I
expect
*NL*
old
Mrs.
Lee
would
love
to
slip
her
shoes
off
now
sometimes
,
if
*NL*
she
dared
.
I
'm
glad
I
'm
not
Lou
's
mother-in-law
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ivar
looked
about
mysteriously
and
lowered
his
voice
almost
to
a
*NL*
whisper
.
``
You
know
what
they
have
over
at
Lou
's
house
?
A
great
*NL*
white
tub
,
like
the
stone
water-troughs
in
the
old
country
,
to
wash
*NL*
themselves
in
.
When
you
sent
me
over
with
the
strawberries
,
they
*NL*
were
all
in
town
but
the
old
woman
Lee
and
the
baby
.
She
took
me
*NL*
in
and
showed
me
the
thing
,
and
she
told
me
it
was
impossible
to
*NL*
wash
yourself
clean
in
it
,
because
,
in
so
much
water
,
you
could
*NL*
not
make
a
strong
suds
.
So
when
they
fill
it
up
and
send
her
in
*NL*
there
,
she
pretends
,
and
makes
a
splashing
noise
.
Then
,
when
they
*NL*
are
all
asleep
,
she
washes
herself
in
a
little
wooden
tub
she
keeps
*NL*
under
her
bed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alexandra
shook
with
laughter
.
``
Poor
old
Mrs.
Lee
!
They
wo
n't
let
*NL*
her
wear
nightcaps
,
either
.
Never
mind
;
when
she
comes
to
visit
*NL*
me
,
she
can
do
all
the
old
things
in
the
old
way
,
and
have
as
much
*NL*
beer
as
she
wants
.
We
'll
start
an
asylum
for
old-time
people
,
*NL*
Ivar
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ivar
folded
his
big
handkerchief
carefully
and
thrust
it
back
into
*NL*
his
blouse
.
``
This
is
always
the
way
,
mistress
.
I
come
to
you
*NL*
sorrowing
,
and
you
send
me
away
with
a
light
heart
.
And
will
you
*NL*
be
so
good
as
to
tell
the
Irishman
that
he
is
not
to
work
the
brown
*NL*
gelding
until
the
sore
on
its
shoulder
is
healed
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
I
will
.
Now
go
and
put
Emil
's
mare
to
the
cart
.
I
am
going
*NL*
to
drive
up
to
the
north
quarter
to
meet
the
man
from
town
who
is
*NL*
to
buy
my
alfalfa
hay
.

III
*NL*
*NL*
Alexandra
was
to
hear
more
of
Ivar
's
case
,
however
.
On
Sunday
her
*NL*
married
brothers
came
to
dinner
.
She
had
asked
them
for
that
day
*NL*
because
Emil
,
who
hated
family
parties
,
would
be
absent
,
dancing
*NL*
at
Amedee
Chevalier
's
wedding
,
up
in
the
French
country
.
The
table
*NL*
was
set
for
company
in
the
dining-room
,
where
highly
varnished
*NL*
wood
and
colored
glass
and
useless
pieces
of
china
were
conspicuous
*NL*
enough
to
satisfy
the
standards
of
the
new
prosperity
.
Alexandra
*NL*
had
put
herself
into
the
hands
of
the
Hanover
furniture
dealer
,
and
*NL*
he
had
conscientiously
done
his
best
to
make
her
dining-room
look
*NL*
like
his
display
window
.
She
said
frankly
that
she
knew
nothing
*NL*
about
such
things
,
and
she
was
willing
to
be
governed
by
the
general
*NL*
conviction
that
the
more
useless
and
utterly
unusable
objects
*NL*
were
,
the
greater
their
virtue
as
ornament
.
That
seemed
reasonable
*NL*
enough
.
Since
she
liked
plain
things
herself
,
it
was
all
the
more
*NL*
necessary
to
have
jars
and
punchbowls
and
candlesticks
in
the
company
*NL*
rooms
for
people
who
did
appreciate
them
.
Her
guests
liked
to
see
*NL*
about
them
these
reassuring
emblems
of
prosperity
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
family
party
was
complete
except
for
Emil
,
and
Oscar
's
wife
*NL*
who
,
in
the
country
phrase
,
``
was
not
going
anywhere
just
now
.
''
*NL*
Oscar
sat
at
the
foot
of
the
table
and
his
four
tow-headed
little
*NL*
boys
,
aged
from
twelve
to
five
,
were
ranged
at
one
side
.
Neither
*NL*
Oscar
nor
Lou
has
changed
much
;
they
have
simply
,
as
Alexandra
said
*NL*
of
them
long
ago
,
grown
to
be
more
and
more
like
themselves
.
Lou
*NL*
now
looks
the
older
of
the
two
;
his
face
is
thin
and
shrewd
and
*NL*
wrinkled
about
the
eyes
,
while
Oscar
's
is
thick
and
dull
.
For
all
*NL*
his
dullness
,
however
,
Oscar
makes
more
money
than
his
brother
,
*NL*
which
adds
to
Lou
's
sharpness
and
uneasiness
and
tempts
him
to
*NL*
make
a
show
.
The
trouble
with
Lou
is
that
he
is
tricky
,
and
his
*NL*
neighbors
have
found
out
that
,
as
Ivar
says
,
he
has
not
a
fox
's
face
*NL*
for
nothing
.
Politics
being
the
natural
field
for
such
talents
,
*NL*
he
neglects
his
farm
to
attend
conventions
and
to
run
for
county
*NL*
offices
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lou
's
wife
,
formerly
Annie
Lee
,
has
grown
to
look
curiously
like
*NL*
her
husband
.
Her
face
has
become
longer
,
sharper
,
more
aggressive
.
*NL*
She
wears
her
yellow
hair
in
a
high
pompadour
,
and
is
bedecked
with
*NL*
rings
and
chains
and
``
beauty
pins
.
''
Her
tight
,
high-heeled
shoes
*NL*
give
her
an
awkward
walk
,
and
she
is
always
more
or
less
preoccupied
*NL*
with
her
clothes
.
As
she
sat
at
the
table
,
she
kept
telling
her
*NL*
youngest
daughter
to
``
be
careful
now
,
and
not
drop
anything
on
*NL*
mother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
conversation
at
the
table
was
all
in
English
.
Oscar
's
wife
,
*NL*
from
the
malaria
district
of
Missouri
,
was
ashamed
of
marrying
a
*NL*
foreigner
,
and
his
boys
do
not
understand
a
word
of
Swedish
.
Annie
*NL*
and
Lou
sometimes
speak
Swedish
at
home
,
but
Annie
is
almost
as
*NL*
much
afraid
of
being
``
caught
''
at
it
as
ever
her
mother
was
of
being
*NL*
caught
barefoot
.
Oscar
still
has
a
thick
accent
,
but
Lou
speaks
*NL*
like
anybody
from
Iowa
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
I
was
in
Hastings
to
attend
the
convention
,
''
he
was
saying
,
*NL*
``
I
saw
the
superintendent
of
the
asylum
,
and
I
was
telling
him
about
*NL*
Ivar
's
symptoms
.
He
says
Ivar
's
case
is
one
of
the
most
dangerous
*NL*
kind
,
and
it
's
a
wonder
he
has
n't
done
something
violent
before
*NL*
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alexandra
laughed
good-humoredly
.
``
Oh
,
nonsense
,
Lou
!
The
doctors
*NL*
would
have
us
all
crazy
if
they
could
.
Ivar
's
queer
,
certainly
,
*NL*
but
he
has
more
sense
than
half
the
hands
I
hire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lou
flew
at
his
fried
chicken
.
``
Oh
,
I
guess
the
doctor
knows
his
*NL*
business
,
Alexandra
.
He
was
very
much
surprised
when
I
told
him
*NL*
how
you
'd
put
up
with
Ivar
.
He
says
he
's
likely
to
set
fire
to
the
*NL*
barn
any
night
,
or
to
take
after
you
and
the
girls
with
an
axe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Little
Signa
,
who
was
waiting
on
the
table
,
giggled
and
fled
to
*NL*
the
kitchen
.
Alexandra
's
eyes
twinkled
.
``
That
was
too
much
for
*NL*
Signa
,
Lou
.
We
all
know
that
Ivar
's
perfectly
harmless
.
The
girls
*NL*
would
as
soon
expect
me
to
chase
them
with
an
axe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lou
flushed
and
signaled
to
his
wife
.
``
All
the
same
,
the
neighbors
*NL*
will
be
having
a
say
about
it
before
long
.
He
may
burn
anybody
's
*NL*
barn
.
It
's
only
necessary
for
one
property-owner
in
the
township
*NL*
to
make
complaint
,
and
he
'll
be
taken
up
by
force
.
You
'd
better
*NL*
send
him
yourself
and
not
have
any
hard
feelings
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alexandra
helped
one
of
her
little
nephews
to
gravy
.
``
Well
,
Lou
,
*NL*
if
any
of
the
neighbors
try
that
,
I
'll
have
myself
appointed
Ivar
's
*NL*
guardian
and
take
the
case
to
court
,
that
's
all
.
I
am
perfectly
*NL*
satisfied
with
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pass
the
preserves
,
Lou
,
''
said
Annie
in
a
warning
tone
.
She
had
*NL*
reasons
for
not
wishing
her
husband
to
cross
Alexandra
too
openly
.
*NL*
``
But
do
n't
you
sort
of
hate
to
have
people
see
him
around
here
,
*NL*
Alexandra
?
''
she
went
on
with
persuasive
smoothness
.
``
He
IS
a
*NL*
disgraceful
object
,
and
you
're
fixed
up
so
nice
now
.
It
sort
of
*NL*
makes
people
distant
with
you
,
when
they
never
know
when
they
'll
*NL*
hear
him
scratching
about
.
My
girls
are
afraid
as
death
of
him
,
*NL*
are
n't
you
,
Milly
,
dear
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Milly
was
fifteen
,
fat
and
jolly
and
pompadoured
,
with
a
creamy
*NL*
complexion
,
square
white
teeth
,
and
a
short
upper
lip
.
She
*NL*
looked
like
her
grandmother
Bergson
,
and
had
her
comfortable
and
*NL*
comfort-loving
nature
.
She
grinned
at
her
aunt
,
with
whom
she
was
*NL*
a
great
deal
more
at
ease
than
she
was
with
her
mother
.
Alexandra
*NL*
winked
a
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Milly
need
n't
be
afraid
of
Ivar
.
She
's
an
especial
favorite
of
*NL*
his
.
In
my
opinion
Ivar
has
just
as
much
right
to
his
own
way
of
*NL*
dressing
and
thinking
as
we
have
.
But
I
'll
see
that
he
does
n't
*NL*
bother
other
people
.
I
'll
keep
him
at
home
,
so
do
n't
trouble
any
*NL*
more
about
him
,
Lou
.
I
've
been
wanting
to
ask
you
about
your
new
*NL*
bathtub
.
How
does
it
work
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Annie
came
to
the
fore
to
give
Lou
time
to
recover
himself
.
``
Oh
,
*NL*
it
works
something
grand
!
I
ca
n't
keep
him
out
of
it
.
He
washes
*NL*
himself
all
over
three
times
a
week
now
,
and
uses
all
the
hot
water
.
*NL*
I
think
it
's
weakening
to
stay
in
as
long
as
he
does
.
You
ought
*NL*
to
have
one
,
Alexandra
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
thinking
of
it
.
I
might
have
one
put
in
the
barn
for
Ivar
,
*NL*
if
it
will
ease
people
's
minds
.
But
before
I
get
a
bathtub
,
I
'm
*NL*
going
to
get
a
piano
for
Milly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Oscar
,
at
the
end
of
the
table
,
looked
up
from
his
plate
.
``
What
*NL*
does
Milly
want
of
a
pianny
?
What
's
the
matter
with
her
organ
?
*NL*
She
can
make
some
use
of
that
,
and
play
in
church
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Annie
looked
flustered
.
She
had
begged
Alexandra
not
to
say
*NL*
anything
about
this
plan
before
Oscar
,
who
was
apt
to
be
jealous
*NL*
of
what
his
sister
did
for
Lou
's
children
.
Alexandra
did
not
get
*NL*
on
with
Oscar
's
wife
at
all
.
``
Milly
can
play
in
church
just
the
*NL*
same
,
and
she
'll
still
play
on
the
organ
.
But
practising
on
it
*NL*
so
much
spoils
her
touch
.
Her
teacher
says
so
,
''
Annie
brought
out
*NL*
with
spirit
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oscar
rolled
his
eyes
.
``
Well
,
Milly
must
have
got
on
pretty
good
*NL*
if
she
's
got
past
the
organ
.
I
know
plenty
of
grown
folks
that
*NL*
ai
n't
,
''
he
said
bluntly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Annie
threw
up
her
chin
.
``
She
has
got
on
good
,
and
she
's
going
to
*NL*
play
for
her
commencement
when
she
graduates
in
town
next
year
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Alexandra
firmly
,
``
I
think
Milly
deserves
a
piano
.
*NL*
All
the
girls
around
here
have
been
taking
lessons
for
years
,
but
*NL*
Milly
is
the
only
one
of
them
who
can
ever
play
anything
when
you
*NL*
ask
her
.
I
'll
tell
you
when
I
first
thought
I
would
like
to
give
*NL*
you
a
piano
,
Milly
,
and
that
was
when
you
learned
that
book
of
old
*NL*
Swedish
songs
that
your
grandfather
used
to
sing
.
He
had
a
sweet
*NL*
tenor
voice
,
and
when
he
was
a
young
man
he
loved
to
sing
.
I
can
*NL*
remember
hearing
him
singing
with
the
sailors
down
in
the
shipyard
,
*NL*
when
I
was
no
bigger
than
Stella
here
,
''
pointing
to
Annie
's
younger
*NL*
daughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
Milly
and
Stella
both
looked
through
the
door
into
the
sitting-room
,
*NL*
where
a
crayon
portrait
of
John
Bergson
hung
on
the
wall
.
Alexandra
*NL*
had
had
it
made
from
a
little
photograph
,
taken
for
his
friends
*NL*
just
before
he
left
Sweden
;
a
slender
man
of
thirty-five
,
with
*NL*
soft
hair
curling
about
his
high
forehead
,
a
drooping
mustache
,
*NL*
and
wondering
,
sad
eyes
that
looked
forward
into
the
distance
,
as
*NL*
if
they
already
beheld
the
New
World
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
dinner
Lou
and
Oscar
went
to
the
orchard
to
pick
cherries
--
they
*NL*
had
neither
of
them
had
the
patience
to
grow
an
orchard
of
their
*NL*
own
--
and
Annie
went
down
to
gossip
with
Alexandra
's
kitchen
girls
*NL*
while
they
washed
the
dishes
.
She
could
always
find
out
more
about
*NL*
Alexandra
's
domestic
economy
from
the
prattling
maids
than
from
*NL*
Alexandra
herself
,
and
what
she
discovered
she
used
to
her
own
*NL*
advantage
with
Lou
.
On
the
Divide
,
farmers
'
daughters
no
longer
*NL*
went
out
into
service
,
so
Alexandra
got
her
girls
from
Sweden
,
by
*NL*
paying
their
fare
over
.
They
stayed
with
her
until
they
married
,
*NL*
and
were
replaced
by
sisters
or
cousins
from
the
old
country
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alexandra
took
her
three
nieces
into
the
flower
garden
.
She
was
*NL*
fond
of
the
little
girls
,
especially
of
Milly
,
who
came
to
spend
*NL*
a
week
with
her
aunt
now
and
then
,
and
read
aloud
to
her
from
the
*NL*
old
books
about
the
house
,
or
listened
to
stories
about
the
early
*NL*
days
on
the
Divide
.
While
they
were
walking
among
the
flower
beds
,
*NL*
a
buggy
drove
up
the
hill
and
stopped
in
front
of
the
gate
.
A
man
*NL*
got
out
and
stood
talking
to
the
driver
.
The
little
girls
were
*NL*
delighted
at
the
advent
of
a
stranger
,
some
one
from
very
far
away
,
*NL*
they
knew
by
his
clothes
,
his
gloves
,
and
the
sharp
,
pointed
cut
*NL*
of
his
dark
beard
.
The
girls
fell
behind
their
aunt
and
peeped
out
*NL*
at
him
from
among
the
castor
beans
.
The
stranger
came
up
to
the
*NL*
gate
and
stood
holding
his
hat
in
his
hand
,
smiling
,
while
Alexandra
*NL*
advanced
slowly
to
meet
him
.
As
she
approached
he
spoke
in
a
low
,
*NL*
pleasant
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
know
me
,
Alexandra
?
I
would
have
known
you
,
anywhere
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alexandra
shaded
her
eyes
with
her
hand
.
Suddenly
she
took
a
quick
*NL*
step
forward
.
``
Can
it
be
!
''
she
exclaimed
with
feeling
;
``
can
it
be
*NL*
that
it
is
Carl
Linstrum
?
Why
,
Carl
,
it
is
!
''
She
threw
out
both
*NL*
her
hands
and
caught
his
across
the
gate
.
``
Sadie
,
Milly
,
run
tell
*NL*
your
father
and
Uncle
Oscar
that
our
old
friend
Carl
Linstrum
is
*NL*
here
.
Be
quick
!
Why
,
Carl
,
how
did
it
happen
?
I
ca
n't
believe
*NL*
this
!
''
Alexandra
shook
the
tears
from
her
eyes
and
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
stranger
nodded
to
his
driver
,
dropped
his
suitcase
inside
*NL*
the
fence
,
and
opened
the
gate
.
``
Then
you
are
glad
to
see
me
,
and
*NL*
you
can
put
me
up
overnight
?
I
could
n't
go
through
this
country
*NL*
without
stopping
off
to
have
a
look
at
you
.
How
little
you
have
*NL*
changed
!
Do
you
know
,
I
was
sure
it
would
be
like
that
.
You
*NL*
simply
could
n't
be
different
.
How
fine
you
are
!
''
He
stepped
back
*NL*
and
looked
at
her
admiringly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alexandra
blushed
and
laughed
again
.
``
But
you
yourself
,
Carl
--
with
*NL*
that
beard
--
how
could
I
have
known
you
?
You
went
away
a
little
*NL*
boy
.
''
She
reached
for
his
suitcase
and
when
he
intercepted
her
*NL*
she
threw
up
her
hands
.
``
You
see
,
I
give
myself
away
.
I
have
only
*NL*
women
come
to
visit
me
,
and
I
do
not
know
how
to
behave
.
Where
is
*NL*
your
trunk
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
in
Hanover
.
I
can
stay
only
a
few
days
.
I
am
on
my
way
to
*NL*
the
coast
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
started
up
the
path
.
``
A
few
days
?
After
all
these
years
!
''
*NL*
Alexandra
shook
her
finger
at
him
.
``
See
this
,
you
have
walked
*NL*
into
a
trap
.
You
do
not
get
away
so
easy
.
''
She
put
her
hand
*NL*
affectionately
on
his
shoulder
.
``
You
owe
me
a
visit
for
the
sake
*NL*
of
old
times
.
Why
must
you
go
to
the
coast
at
all
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
must
!
I
am
a
fortune
hunter

From
Seattle
I
go
on
to
*NL*
Alaska

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alaska
?
''
She
looked
at
him
in
astonishment
.
``
Are
you
going
to
*NL*
paint
the
Indians
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Paint
?
''
the
young
man
frowned
.
``
Oh
!
I
'm
not
a
painter

Alexandra

*NL*
I
'm
an
engraver
.
I
have
nothing
to
do
with
painting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
on
my
parlor
wall
I
have
the
paintings
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
interrupted
nervously
.
``
Oh
,
water-color
sketches
--
done
for
*NL*
amusement
.
I
sent
them
to
remind
you
of
me
,
not
because
they
were
*NL*
good
.
What
a
wonderful
place
you
have
made
of
this
,
Alexandra
.
''
*NL*
He
turned
and
looked
back
at
the
wide
,
map-like
prospect
of
field
*NL*
and
hedge
and
pasture
.
``
I
would
never
have
believed
it
could
be
*NL*
done
.
I
'm
disappointed
in
my
own
eye
,
in
my
imagination
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
moment
Lou
and
Oscar
came
up
the
hill
from
the
orchard
.
*NL*
They
did
not
quicken
their
pace
when
they
saw
Carl
;
indeed
,
they
*NL*
did
not
openly
look
in
his
direction
.
They
advanced
distrustfully
,
*NL*
and
as
if
they
wished
the
distance
were
longer
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alexandra
beckoned
to
them
.
``
They
think
I
am
trying
to
fool
them
.
*NL*
Come
,
boys
,
it
's
Carl
Linstrum
,
our
old
Carl
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lou
gave
the
visitor
a
quick
,
sidelong
glance
and
thrust
out
his
*NL*
hand
.
``
Glad
to
see
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Oscar
followed
with
``
How
d'
do
.
''
Carl
could
not
tell
whether
their
*NL*
offishness
came
from
unfriendliness
or
from
embarrassment
.
He
and
*NL*
Alexandra
led
the
way
to
the
porch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Carl
,
''
Alexandra
explained
,
``
is
on
his
way
to
Seattle
.
He
is
*NL*
going
to
Alaska
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Oscar
studied
the
visitor
's
yellow
shoes
.
``
Got
business
there
?
''
*NL*
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carl
laughed
.
``
Yes
,
very
pressing
business
.
I
'm
going
there
to
*NL*
get
rich
.
Engraving
's
a
very
interesting
profession
,
but
a
man
*NL*
never
makes
any
money
at
it
.
So
I
'm
going
to
try
the
goldfields
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alexandra
felt
that
this
was
a
tactful
speech
,
and
Lou
looked
up
*NL*
with
some
interest
.
``
Ever
done
anything
in
that
line
before
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
but
I
'm
going
to
join
a
friend
of
mine
who
went
out
from
New
*NL*
York
and
has
done
well
.
He
has
offered
to
break
me
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Turrible
cold
winters

there

I
hear

remarked
Oscar
.
``
I
thought
*NL*
people
went
up
there
in
the
spring

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
do

But
my
friend
is
going
to
spend
the
winter
in
Seattle

*NL*
I
am
to
stay
with
him
there
and
learn
something
about
prospecting
*NL*
before
we
start
north
next
year
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lou
looked
skeptical
.
``
Let
's
see
,
how
long
have
you
been
away
from
*NL*
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sixteen
years
.
You
ought
to
remember
that

Lou
,
for
you
were
*NL*
married
just
after
we
went
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Going
to
stay
with
us
some
time
?

Oscar
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
few
days
,
if
Alexandra
can
keep
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
expect
you
'll
be
wanting
to
see
your
old
place
,
''
Lou
observed
*NL*
more
cordially
.
``
You
wo
n't
hardly
know
it
.
But
there
's
a
few
*NL*
chunks
of
your
old
sod
house
left
.
Alexandra
would
n't
never
let
*NL*
Frank
Shabata
plough
over
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Annie
Lee
,
who
,
ever
since
the
visitor
was
announced
,
had
been
*NL*
touching
up
her
hair
and
settling
her
lace
and
wishing
she
had
worn
*NL*
another
dress
,
now
emerged
with
her
three
daughters
and
introduced
*NL*
them
.
She
was
greatly
impressed
by
Carl
's
urban
appearance
,
and
*NL*
in
her
excitement
talked
very
loud
and
threw
her
head
about
.
``
And
*NL*
you
ai
n't
married
yet
?
At
your
age
,
now
!
Think
of
that
!
You
'll
*NL*
have
to
wait
for
Milly

Yes

we
've
got
a
boy
,
too
.
The
youngest

*NL*
He
's
at
home
with
his
grandma

You
must
come
over
to
see
mother
*NL*
and
hear
Milly
play
.
She
's
the
musician
of
the
family
.
She
does
*NL*
pyrography
,
too
.
That
's
burnt
wood
,
you
know

You
would
n't
believe
*NL*
what
she
can
do
with
her
poker
.
Yes
,
she
goes
to
school
in
town
,
*NL*
and
she
is
the
youngest
in
her
class
by
two
years
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Milly
looked
uncomfortable
and
Carl
took
her
hand
again
.
He
liked
*NL*
her
creamy
skin
and
happy
,
innocent
eyes
,
and
he
could
see
that
her
*NL*
mother
's
way
of
talking
distressed
her
.
``
I
'm
sure
she
's
a
clever
*NL*
little
girl
,
''
he
murmured
,
looking
at
her
thoughtfully
.
``
Let
me
*NL*
see
--
Ah
,
it
's
your
mother
that
she
looks
like

Alexandra

Mrs.
*NL*
Bergson
must
have
looked
just
like
this
when
she
was
a
little
*NL*
girl
.
Does
Milly
run
about
over
the
country
as
you
and
Alexandra
*NL*
used
to
,
Annie
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Milly
's
mother
protested
.
``
Oh
,
my
,
no
!
Things
has
changed
since
*NL*
we
was
girls
.
Milly
has
it
very
different
.
We
are
going
to
rent
*NL*
the
place
and
move
into
town
as
soon
as
the
girls
are
old
enough
*NL*
to
go
out
into
company
.
A
good
many
are
doing
that
here
now
.
Lou
*NL*
is
going
into
business
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lou
grinned
.
``
That
's
what
she
says
.
You
better
go
get
your
things
*NL*
on
.
Ivar
's
hitching
up

''
he
added
,
turning
to
Annie
.
*NL*
*NL*
Young
farmers
seldom
address
their
wives
by
name
.
It
is
always
*NL*
``
you
,
''
or
``
she
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Having
got
his
wife
out
of
the
way
,
Lou
sat
down
on
the
step
and
*NL*
began
to
whittle
.
``
Well
,
what
do
folks
in
New
York
think
of
William
*NL*
Jennings
Bryan
?
''
Lou
began
to
bluster
,
as
he
always
did
when
he
*NL*
talked
politics
.
``
We
gave
Wall
Street
a
scare
in
ninety-six
,
all
*NL*
right
,
and
we
're
fixing
another
to
hand
them
.
Silver
was
n't
the
*NL*
only
issue
,
''
he
nodded
mysteriously
.
``
There
's
a
good
many
things
*NL*
got
to
be
changed
.
The
West
is
going
to
make
itself
heard
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carl
laughed
.
``
But
,
surely
,
it
did
do
that
,
if
nothing
else
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lou
's
thin
face
reddened
up
to
the
roots
of
his
bristly
hair
.
``
Oh
,
*NL*
we
've
only
begun
.
We
're
waking
up
to
a
sense
of
our
responsibilities
,
*NL*
out
here
,
and
we
ai
n't
afraid
,
neither
.
You
fellows
back
there
*NL*
must
be
a
tame
lot
.
If
you
had
any
nerve
you
'd
get
together
and
*NL*
march
down
to
Wall
Street
and
blow
it
up
.
Dynamite
it
,
I
mean
,
''
*NL*
with
a
threatening
nod
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
so
much
in
earnest
that
Carl
scarcely
knew
how
to
answer
*NL*
him
.
``
That
would
be
a
waste
of
powder
.
The
same
business
would
*NL*
go
on
in
another
street

The
street
does
n't
matter
.
But
what
have
*NL*
you
fellows
out
here
got
to
kick
about
?
You
have
the
only
safe
*NL*
place
there
is
.
Morgan
himself
could
n't
touch
you
.
One
only
has
*NL*
to
drive
through
this
country
to
see
that
you
're
all
as
rich
as
*NL*
barons
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
a
good
deal
more
to
say
than
we
had
when
we
were
poor
,
''
*NL*
said
Lou
threateningly
.
``
We
're
getting
on
to
a
whole
lot
of
things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
Ivar
drove
a
double
carriage
up
to
the
gate
,
Annie
came
out
in
*NL*
a
hat
that
looked
like
the
model
of
a
battleship
.
Carl
rose
and
*NL*
took
her
down
to
the
carriage
,
while
Lou
lingered
for
a
word
with
*NL*
his
sister
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
suppose
he
's
come
for
?
''
he
asked
,
jerking
his
head
*NL*
toward
the
gate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
to
pay
us
a
visit
.
I
've
been
begging
him
to
for
years
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Oscar
looked
at
Alexandra
.
``
He
did
n't
let
you
know
he
was
coming
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
Why
should
he
?
I
told
him
to
come
at
any
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lou
shrugged
his
shoulders
.
``
He
does
n't
seem
to
have
done
much
*NL*
for
himself
.
Wandering
around
this
way
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Oscar
spoke
solemnly
,
as
from
the
depths
of
a
cavern
.
``
He
never
*NL*
was
much
account
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alexandra
left
them
and
hurried
down
to
the
gate
where
Annie
was
*NL*
rattling
on
to
Carl
about
her
new
dining-room
furniture
.
``
You
*NL*
must
bring
Mr.
Linstrum
over
real
soon
,
only
be
sure
to
telephone
*NL*
me
first
,
''
she
called
back
,
as
Carl
helped
her
into
the
carriage
.
*NL*
Old
Ivar
,
his
white
head
bare
,
stood
holding
the
horses
.
Lou
came
*NL*
down
the
path
and
climbed
into
the
front
seat
,
took
up
the
reins
,
*NL*
and
drove
off
without
saying
anything
further
to
any
one
.
Oscar
*NL*
picked
up
his
youngest
boy
and
trudged
off
down
the
road
,
the
other
*NL*
three
trotting
after
him
.
Carl
,
holding
the
gate
open
for
Alexandra
,
*NL*
began
to
laugh
.
``
Up
and
coming
on
the
Divide
,
eh
,
Alexandra
?
''
he
*NL*
cried
gayly
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
IV
*NL*
*NL*
Carl
had
changed
,
Alexandra
felt
,
much
less
than
one
might
have
*NL*
expected
.
He
had
not
become
a
trim
,
self-satisfied
city
man
.
There
*NL*
was
still
something
homely
and
wayward
and
definitely
personal
*NL*
about
him
.
Even
his
clothes
,
his
Norfolk
coat
and
his
very
high
*NL*
collars
,
were
a
little
unconventional
.
He
seemed
to
shrink
into
*NL*
himself
as
he
used
to
do
;
to
hold
himself
away
from
things
,
as
if
*NL*
he
were
afraid
of
being
hurt
.
In
short
,
he
was
more
self-conscious
*NL*
than
a
man
of
thirty-five
is
expected
to
be
.
He
looked
older
than
*NL*
his
years
and
not
very
strong
.
His
black
hair
,
which
still
hung
*NL*
in
a
triangle
over
his
pale
forehead
,
was
thin
at
the
crown
,
and
*NL*
there
were
fine
,
relentless
lines
about
his
eyes
.
His
back
,
with
*NL*
its
high
,
sharp
shoulders
,
looked
like
the
back
of
an
over-worked
*NL*
German
professor
off
on
his
holiday
.
His
face
was
intelligent
,
*NL*
sensitive
,
unhappy
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
evening
after
supper
,
Carl
and
Alexandra
were
sitting
by
the
*NL*
clump
of
castor
beans
in
the
middle
of
the
flower
garden
.
The
*NL*
gravel
paths
glittered
in
the
moonlight
,
and
below
them
the
fields
*NL*
lay
white
and
still
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
,
Alexandra
,
''
he
was
saying
,
``
I
've
been
thinking
how
*NL*
strangely
things
work
out
.
I
've
been
away
engraving
other
men
's
*NL*
pictures
,
and
you
've
stayed
at
home
and
made
your
own
.
''
He
pointed
*NL*
with
his
cigar
toward
the
sleeping
landscape
.
``
How
in
the
world
*NL*
have
you
done
it
?
How
have
your
neighbors
done
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
had
n't
any
of
us
much
to
do
with
it
,
Carl
.
The
land
did
it
.
*NL*
It
had
its
little
joke
.
It
pretended
to
be
poor
because
nobody
*NL*
knew
how
to
work
it
right
;
and
then
,
all
at
once
,
it
worked
itself
.
*NL*
It
woke
up
out
of
its
sleep
and
stretched
itself
,
and
it
was
so
big
,
*NL*
so
rich
,
that
we
suddenly
found
we
were
rich
,
just
from
sitting
*NL*
still
.
As
for
me
,
you
remember
when
I
began
to
buy
land
.
For
*NL*
years
after
that
I
was
always
squeezing
and
borrowing
until
I
was
*NL*
ashamed
to
show
my
face
in
the
banks
.
And
then
,
all
at
once
,
men
*NL*
began
to
come
to
me
offering
to
lend
me
money
--
and
I
did
n't
need
*NL*
it
!
Then
I
went
ahead
and
built
this
house
.
I
really
built
it
*NL*
for
Emil
.
I
want
you
to
see
Emil
,
Carl
.
He
is
so
different
from
*NL*
the
rest
of
us
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
different
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
'll
see
!
I
'm
sure
it
was
to
have
sons
like
Emil
,
and
to
*NL*
give
them
a
chance
,
that
father
left
the
old
country
.
It
's
curious
,
*NL*
too
;
on
the
outside
Emil
is
just
like
an
American
boy
,
--
he
graduated
*NL*
from
the
State
University
in
June
,
you
know
,
--
but
underneath
he
is
*NL*
more
Swedish
than
any
of
us
.
Sometimes
he
is
so
like
father
that
*NL*
he
frightens
me
;
he
is
so
violent
in
his
feelings
like
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
he
going
to
farm
here
with
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
shall
do
whatever
he
wants
to
,
''
Alexandra
declared
warmly
.
``
He
*NL*
is
going
to
have
a
chance
,
a
whole
chance
;
that
's
what
I
've
worked
*NL*
for
.
Sometimes
he
talks
about
studying
law
,
and
sometimes
,
just
*NL*
lately
,
he
's
been
talking
about
going
out
into
the
sand
hills
and
*NL*
taking
up
more
land
.
He
has
his
sad
times
,
like
father
.
But
I
*NL*
hope
he
wo
n't
do
that
.
We
have
land
enough
,
at
last
!
''
Alexandra
*NL*
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
about
Lou
and
Oscar
?
They
've
done
well
,
have
n't
they
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

very
well
;
but
they
are
different
,
and
now
that
they
have
*NL*
farms
of
their
own
I
do
not
see
so
much
of
them
.
We
divided
the
*NL*
land
equally
when
Lou
married
.
They
have
their
own
way
of
doing
*NL*
things
,
and
they
do
not
altogether
like
my
way
,
I
am
afraid
.
Perhaps
*NL*
they
think
me
too
independent
.
But
I
have
had
to
think
for
myself
*NL*
a
good
many
years
and
am
not
likely
to
change
.
On
the
whole
,
*NL*
though
,
we
take
as
much
comfort
in
each
other
as
most
brothers
and
*NL*
sisters
do
.
And
I
am
very
fond
of
Lou
's
oldest
daughter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
liked
the
old
Lou
and
Oscar
better
,
and
they
probably
*NL*
feel
the
same
about
me
.
I
even
,
if
you
can
keep
a
secret
,
''
--
Carl
*NL*
leaned
forward
and
touched
her
arm
,
smiling
,
--
``
I
even
think
I
liked
*NL*
the
old
country
better
.
This
is
all
very
splendid
in
its
way
,
*NL*
but
there
was
something
about
this
country
when
it
was
a
wild
old
*NL*
beast
that
has
haunted
me
all
these
years
.
Now
,
when
I
come
back
*NL*
to
all
this
milk
and
honey
,
I
feel
like
the
old
German
song
,
`
Wo
*NL*
bist
du
,
wo
bist
du
,
mein
geliebtest
Land
?
'
--
Do
you
ever
feel
like
*NL*
that
,
I
wonder
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sometimes
,
when
I
think
about
father
and
mother
and
those
*NL*
who
are
gone
;
so
many
of
our
old
neighbors
.
''
Alexandra
paused
and
*NL*
looked
up
thoughtfully
at
the
stars
.
``
We
can
remember
the
graveyard
*NL*
when
it
was
wild
prairie
,
Carl
,
and
now
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
the
old
story
has
begun
to
write
itself
over
there
,
''
said
*NL*
Carl
softly
.
``
Is
n't
it
queer
:
there
are
only
two
or
three
human
*NL*
stories
,
and
they
go
on
repeating
themselves
as
fiercely
as
if
they
*NL*
had
never
happened
before
;
like
the
larks
in
this
country
,
that
*NL*
have
been
singing
the
same
five
notes
over
for
thousands
of
years
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
!
The
young
people
,
they
live
so
hard
.
And
yet
I
sometimes
*NL*
envy
them
.
There
is
my
little
neighbor
,
now
;
the
people
who
bought
*NL*
your
old
place
.
I
would
n't
have
sold
it
to
any
one
else
,
but
I
*NL*
was
always
fond
of
that
girl
.
You
must
remember
her
,
little
Marie
*NL*
Tovesky
,
from
Omaha
,
who
used
to
visit
here
?
When
she
was
eighteen
*NL*
she
ran
away
from
the
convent
school
and
got
married
,
crazy
child
!
*NL*
She
came
out
here
a
bride
,
with
her
father
and
husband
.
He
had
*NL*
nothing
,
and
the
old
man
was
willing
to
buy
them
a
place
and
set
*NL*
them
up
.
Your
farm
took
her
fancy
,
and
I
was
glad
to
have
her
so
*NL*
near
me
.
I
've
never
been
sorry
,
either
.
I
even
try
to
get
along
*NL*
with
Frank
on
her
account
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
Frank
her
husband
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
He
's
one
of
these
wild
fellows
.
Most
Bohemians
are
*NL*
good-natured
,
but
Frank
thinks
we
do
n't
appreciate
him
here
,
I
*NL*
guess
.
He
's
jealous
about
everything
,
his
farm
and
his
horses
and
*NL*
his
pretty
wife
.
Everybody
likes
her
,
just
the
same
as
when
she
*NL*
was
little
.
Sometimes
I
go
up
to
the
Catholic
church
with
Emil
,
*NL*
and
it
's
funny
to
see
Marie
standing
there
laughing
and
shaking
*NL*
hands
with
people
,
looking
so
excited
and
gay
,
with
Frank
sulking
*NL*
behind
her
as
if
he
could
eat
everybody
alive
.
Frank
's
not
a
bad
*NL*
neighbor
,
but
to
get
on
with
him
you
've
got
to
make
a
fuss
over
*NL*
him
and
act
as
if
you
thought
he
was
a
very
important
person
all
*NL*
the
time
,
and
different
from
other
people
.
I
find
it
hard
to
keep
*NL*
that
up
from
one
year
's
end
to
another
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
n't
think
you
'd
be
very
successful
at
that
kind
of
thing
,
*NL*
Alexandra
.
''
Carl
seemed
to
find
the
idea
amusing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Alexandra
firmly
,
``
I
do
the
best
I
can
,
on
Marie
's
*NL*
account
.
She
has
it
hard
enough
,
anyway
.
She
's
too
young
and
*NL*
pretty
for
this
sort
of
life
.
We
're
all
ever
so
much
older
and
*NL*
slower
.
But
she
's
the
kind
that
wo
n't
be
downed
easily
.
She
'll
*NL*
work
all
day
and
go
to
a
Bohemian
wedding
and
dance
all
night
,
and
*NL*
drive
the
hay
wagon
for
a
cross
man
next
morning
.
I
could
stay
by
*NL*
a
job
,
but
I
never
had
the
go
in
me
that
she
has
,
when
I
was
going
*NL*
my
best

I
'll
have
to
take
you
over
to
see
her
to-morrow

''
*NL*
*NL*
Carl
dropped
the
end
of
his
cigar
softly
among
the
castor
beans
and
*NL*
sighed
.
``
Yes
,
I
suppose
I
must
see
the
old
place

I
'm
cowardly
*NL*
about
things
that
remind

of
myself

It
took
courage
to
come
*NL*
at
all
,
Alexandra
.
I
would
n't
have

if
I
had
n't
wanted
to
see
you
*NL*
very
,
very
much

''
*NL*
*NL*
Alexandra
looked
at
him
with
her
calm
,
deliberate
eyes
.
``
Why
do
*NL*
you
dread
things
like
that

Carl
?

she
asked
earnestly
.
``
Why
are
*NL*
you
dissatisfied
with
yourself

''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
visitor
winced
.
``
How
direct
you
are
,
Alexandra
!
Just
like
*NL*
you
used
to
be
.
Do
I
give
myself
away
so
quickly
?
Well
,
you
see
,
*NL*
for
one
thing
,
there
's
nothing
to
look
forward
to
in
my
profession
.
*NL*
Wood-engraving
is
the
only
thing
I
care
about
,
and
that
had
gone
out
*NL*
before
I
began
.
Everything
's
cheap
metal
work
nowadays
,
touching
*NL*
up
miserable
photographs
,
forcing
up
poor
drawings
,
and
spoiling
good
*NL*
ones
.
I
'm
absolutely
sick
of
it
all
.
''
Carl
frowned
.
``
Alexandra
,
*NL*
all
the
way
out
from
New
York
I
've
been
planning
how
I
could
*NL*
deceive
you
and
make
you
think
me
a
very
enviable
fellow
,
and
here
*NL*
I
am
telling
you
the
truth
the
first
night
.
I
waste
a
lot
of
time
*NL*
pretending
to
people
,
and
the
joke
of
it
is
,
I
do
n't
think
I
ever
*NL*
deceive
any
one

There
are
too
many
of
my
kind
;
people
know
us
on
*NL*
sight

''
*NL*
*NL*
Carl
paused
.
Alexandra
pushed
her
hair
back
from
her
brow
with
a
*NL*
puzzled
,
thoughtful
gesture
.
``
You
see
,
''
he
went
on
calmly
,
``
measured
*NL*
by
your
standards
here
,
I
'm
a
failure
.
I
could
n't
buy
even
one
of
*NL*
your
cornfields
.
I
've
enjoyed
a
great
many
things
,
but
I
've
got
*NL*
nothing
to
show
for
it
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
show
for
it
yourself

Carl

I

rather
have
had
your
*NL*
freedom
than
my
land
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carl
shook
his
head
mournfully
.
``
Freedom
so
often
means
that
one
*NL*
is
n't
needed
anywhere
.
Here
you
are
an
individual
,
you
have
a
*NL*
background
of
your
own
,
you
would
be
missed
.
But
off
there
in
the
*NL*
cities
there
are
thousands
of
rolling
stones
like
me
.
We
are
all
*NL*
alike
;
we
have
no
ties
,
we
know
nobody
,
we
own
nothing
.
When
one
*NL*
of
us
dies
,
they
scarcely
know
where
to
bury
him
.
Our
landlady
and
*NL*
the
delicatessen
man
are
our
mourners
,
and
we
leave
nothing
behind
*NL*
us
but
a
frock-coat
and
a
fiddle
,
or
an
easel
,
or
a
typewriter
,
or
*NL*
whatever
tool
we
got
our
living
by
.
All
we
have
ever
managed
to
*NL*
do
is
to
pay
our
rent
,
the
exorbitant
rent
that
one
has
to
pay
for
*NL*
a
few
square
feet
of
space
near
the
heart
of
things
.
We
have
no
*NL*
house
,
no
place
,
no
people
of
our
own
.
We
live
in
the
streets
,
*NL*
in
the
parks
,
in
the
theatres
.
We
sit
in
restaurants
and
concert
*NL*
halls
and
look
about
at
the
hundreds
of
our
own
kind
and
shudder
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alexandra
was
silent
.
She
sat
looking
at
the
silver
spot
the
moon
*NL*
made
on
the
surface
of
the
pond
down
in
the
pasture
.
He
knew
that
*NL*
she
understood
what
he
meant
.
At
last
she
said
slowly
,
``
And
yet
I
*NL*
would
rather
have
Emil
grow
up
like
that
than
like
his
two
brothers

*NL*
We
pay
a
high
rent
,
too
,
though
we
pay
differently

We
grow
hard
*NL*
and
heavy
here
.
We
do
n't
move
lightly
and
easily
as
you
do
,
and
*NL*
our
minds
get
stiff
.
If
the
world
were
no
wider
than
my
cornfields
,
*NL*
if
there
were
not
something
beside
this
,
I
would
n't
feel
that
it
*NL*
was
much
worth
while
to
work
.
No
,
I
would
rather
have
Emil
like
*NL*
you
than
like
them
.
I
felt
that
as
soon
as
you
came
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wonder
why
you
feel
like
that
?
''
Carl
mused
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
.
Perhaps
I
am
like
Carrie
Jensen
,
the
sister
of
one
*NL*
of
my
hired
men
.
She
had
never
been
out
of
the
cornfields
,
and
a
*NL*
few
years
ago
she
got
despondent
and
said
life
was
just
the
same
*NL*
thing
over
and
over
,
and
she
did
n't
see
the
use
of
it
.
After
she
*NL*
had
tried
to
kill
herself
once
or
twice
,
her
folks
got
worried
and
*NL*
sent
her
over
to
Iowa
to
visit
some
relations
.
Ever
since
she
's
*NL*
come
back
she
's
been
perfectly
cheerful
,
and
she
says
she
's
contented
*NL*
to
live
and
work
in
a
world
that
's
so
big
and
interesting
.
She
*NL*
said
that
anything
as
big
as
the
bridges
over
the
Platte
and
the
*NL*
Missouri
reconciled
her
.
And
it
's
what
goes
on
in
the
world
that
*NL*
reconciles
me
.

*NL*
V
*NL*
*NL*
Alexandra
did
not
find
time
to
go
to
her
neighbor
's
the
next
day
,
nor
*NL*
the
next
.
It
was
a
busy
season
on
the
farm
,
with
the
corn-plowing
*NL*
going
on
,
and
even
Emil
was
in
the
field
with
a
team
and
cultivator
.
*NL*
Carl
went
about
over
the
farms
with
Alexandra
in
the
morning
,
and
*NL*
in
the
afternoon
and
evening
they
found
a
great
deal
to
talk
about
.
*NL*
Emil
,
for
all
his
track
practice
,
did
not
stand
up
under
farmwork
*NL*
very
well
,
and
by
night
he
was
too
tired
to
talk
or
even
to
practise
*NL*
on
his
cornet
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
Wednesday
morning
Carl
got
up
before
it
was
light
,
and
stole
*NL*
downstairs
and
out
of
the
kitchen
door
just
as
old
Ivar
was
making
*NL*
his
morning
ablutions
at
the
pump
.
Carl
nodded
to
him
and
hurried
*NL*
up
the
draw
,
past
the
garden
,
and
into
the
pasture
where
the
milking
*NL*
cows
used
to
be
kept
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
dawn
in
the
east
looked
like
the
light
from
some
great
fire
that
*NL*
was
burning
under
the
edge
of
the
world
.
The
color
was
reflected
*NL*
in
the
globules
of
dew
that
sheathed
the
short
gray
pasture
grass
.
*NL*
Carl
walked
rapidly
until
he
came
to
the
crest
of
the
second
hill
,
*NL*
where
the
Bergson
pasture
joined
the
one
that
had
belonged
to
his
*NL*
father
.
There
he
sat
down
and
waited
for
the
sun
to
rise
.
It
was
*NL*
just
there
that
he
and
Alexandra
used
to
do
their
milking
together
,
he
*NL*
on
his
side
of
the
fence
,
she
on
hers
.
He
could
remember
exactly
*NL*
how
she
looked
when
she
came
over
the
close-cropped
grass
,
her
*NL*
skirts
pinned
up
,
her
head
bare
,
a
bright
tin
pail
in
either
hand
,
*NL*
and
the
milky
light
of
the
early
morning
all
about
her
.
Even
as
*NL*
a
boy
he
used
to
feel
,
when
he
saw
her
coming
with
her
free
step
,
*NL*
her
upright
head
and
calm
shoulders
,
that
she
looked
as
if
she
had
*NL*
walked
straight
out
of
the
morning
itself
.
Since
then
,
when
he
had
*NL*
happened
to
see
the
sun
come
up
in
the
country
or
on
the
water
,
he
*NL*
had
often
remembered
the
young
Swedish
girl
and
her
milking
pails
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carl
sat
musing
until
the
sun
leaped
above
the
prairie
,
and
in
the
*NL*
grass
about
him
all
the
small
creatures
of
day
began
to
tune
their
*NL*
tiny
instruments
.
Birds
and
insects
without
number
began
to
chirp
,
*NL*
to
twitter
,
to
snap
and
whistle
,
to
make
all
manner
of
fresh
shrill
*NL*
noises
.
The
pasture
was
flooded
with
light
;
every
clump
of
ironweed
*NL*
and
snow-on-the-mountain
threw
a
long
shadow
,
and
the
golden
light
*NL*
seemed
to
be
rippling
through
the
curly
grass
like
the
tide
racing
*NL*
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
crossed
the
fence
into
the
pasture
that
was
now
the
Shabatas
'
and
*NL*
continued
his
walk
toward
the
pond
.
He
had
not
gone
far
,
however
,
*NL*
when
he
discovered
that
he
was
not
the
only
person
abroad
.
In
the
*NL*
draw
below
,
his
gun
in
his
hands
,
was
Emil
,
advancing
cautiously
,
*NL*
with
a
young
woman
beside
him
.
They
were
moving
softly
,
keeping
*NL*
close
together
,
and
Carl
knew
that
they
expected
to
find
ducks
on
*NL*
the
pond
.
At
the
moment
when
they
came
in
sight
of
the
bright
spot
*NL*
of
water
,
he
heard
a
whirr
of
wings
and
the
ducks
shot
up
into
the
*NL*
air
.
There
was
a
sharp
crack
from
the
gun
,
and
five
of
the
birds
*NL*
fell
to
the
ground
.
Emil
and
his
companion
laughed
delightedly
,
*NL*
and
Emil
ran
to
pick
them
up
.
When
he
came
back
,
dangling
the
*NL*
ducks
by
their
feet
,
Marie
held
her
apron
and
he
dropped
them
into
*NL*
it
.
As
she
stood
looking
down
at
them
,
her
face
changed
.
She
*NL*
took
up
one
of
the
birds
,
a
rumpled
ball
of
feathers
with
the
blood
*NL*
dripping
slowly
from
its
mouth
,
and
looked
at
the
live
color
that
*NL*
still
burned
on
its
plumage
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
let
it
fall
,
she
cried
in
distress
,
``
Oh
,
Emil
,
why
did
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
like
that
!
''
the
boy
exclaimed
indignantly
.
``
Why
,
Marie
,
you
*NL*
asked
me
to
come
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
I
know
,
''
she
said
tearfully
,
``
but
I
did
n't
think
.
I
*NL*
hate
to
see
them
when
they
are
first
shot
.
They
were
having
such
*NL*
a
good
time
,
and
we
've
spoiled
it
all
for
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Emil
gave
a
rather
sore
laugh
.
``
I
should
say
we
had
!
I
'm
not
going
*NL*
hunting
with
you
any
more
.
You
're
as
bad
as
Ivar
.
Here
,
let
me
*NL*
take
them
.
''
He
snatched
the
ducks
out
of
her
apron
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
be
cross
,
Emil
.
Only
--
Ivar
's
right
about
wild
things
.
They
're
*NL*
too
happy
to
kill
.
You
can
tell
just
how
they
felt
when
they
flew
*NL*
up
.
They
were
scared
,
but
they
did
n't
really
think
anything
could
*NL*
hurt
them
.
No
,
we
wo
n't
do
that
any
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
''
Emil
assented
.
``
I
'm
sorry
I
made
you
feel
bad
.
''
As
*NL*
he
looked
down
into
her
tearful
eyes
,
there
was
a
curious
,
sharp
*NL*
young
bitterness
in
his
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carl
watched
them
as
they
moved
slowly
down
the
draw
.
They
had
*NL*
not
seen
him
at
all
.
He
had
not
overheard
much
of
their
dialogue
,
*NL*
but
he
felt
the
import
of
it
.
It
made
him
,
somehow
,
unreasonably
*NL*
mournful
to
find
two
young
things
abroad
in
the
pasture
in
the
*NL*
early
morning
.
He
decided
that
he
needed
his
breakfast
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
VI
*NL*
*NL*
At
dinner
that
day
Alexandra
said
she
thought
they
must
really
*NL*
manage
to
go
over
to
the
Shabatas
'
that
afternoon
.
``
It
's
not
often
*NL*
I
let
three
days
go
by
without
seeing
Marie
.
She
will
think
I
have
*NL*
forsaken
her
,
now
that
my
old
friend
has
come
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
men
had
gone
back
to
work
,
Alexandra
put
on
a
white
dress
*NL*
and
her
sun-hat
,
and
she
and
Carl
set
forth
across
the
fields
.
*NL*
``
You
see
we
have
kept
up
the
old
path
,
Carl
.
It
has
been
so
nice
*NL*
for
me
to
feel
that
there
was
a
friend
at
the
other
end
of
it
*NL*
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carl
smiled
a
little
ruefully
.
``
All
the
same
,
I
hope
it
has
n't
*NL*
been
QUITE
the
same
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alexandra
looked
at
him
with
surprise
.
``
Why
,
no
,
of
course
not
.
*NL*
Not
the
same
.
She
could
not
very
well
take
your
place
,
if
that
's
*NL*
what
you
mean
.
I
'm
friendly
with
all
my
neighbors
,
I
hope
.
But
*NL*
Marie
is
really
a
companion
,
some
one
I
can
talk
to
quite
frankly
.
*NL*
You
would
n't
want
me
to
be
more
lonely
than
I
have
been
,
would
*NL*
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carl
laughed
and
pushed
back
the
triangular
lock
of
hair
with
the
*NL*
edge
of
his
hat
.
``
Of
course
I
do
n't
.
I
ought
to
be
thankful
that
*NL*
this
path
has
n't
been
worn
by
--
well
,
by
friends
with
more
pressing
*NL*
errands
than
your
little
Bohemian
is
likely
to
have
.
''
He
paused
*NL*
to
give
Alexandra
his
hand
as
she
stepped
over
the
stile
.
``
Are
*NL*
you
the
least
bit
disappointed
in
our
coming
together
again
?
''
he
*NL*
asked
abruptly
.
``
Is
it
the
way
you
hoped
it
would
be
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alexandra
smiled
at
this
.
``
Only
better
.
When
I
've
thought
about
*NL*
your
coming
,
I
've
sometimes
been
a
little
afraid
of
it
.
You
have
*NL*
lived
where
things
move
so
fast
,
and
everything
is
slow
here
;
the
*NL*
people
slowest
of
all
.
Our
lives
are
like
the
years
,
all
made
up
*NL*
of
weather
and
crops
and
cows
.
How
you
hated
cows
!
''
She
shook
her
*NL*
head
and
laughed
to
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
when
we
milked
together
.
I
walked
up
to
the
pasture
*NL*
corners
this
morning
.
I
wonder
whether
I
shall
ever
be
able
to
*NL*
tell
you
all
that
I
was
thinking
about
up
there
.
It
's
a
strange
*NL*
thing
,
Alexandra
;
I
find
it
easy
to
be
frank
with
you
about
everything
*NL*
under
the
sun
except
--
yourself
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
afraid
of
hurting
my
feelings
,
perhaps
.
''
Alexandra
looked
*NL*
at
him
thoughtfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
'm
afraid
of
giving
you
a
shock
.
You
've
seen
yourself
for
*NL*
so
long
in
the
dull
minds
of
the
people
about
you
,
that
if
I
were
*NL*
to
tell
you
how
you
seem
to
me
,
it
would
startle
you
.
But
you
must
*NL*
see
that
you
astonish
me
.
You
must
feel
when
people
admire
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alexandra
blushed
and
laughed
with
some
confusion
.
``
I
felt
that
*NL*
you
were
pleased
with
me
,
if
you
mean
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
've
felt
when
other
people
were
pleased
with
you
?
''
he
*NL*
insisted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
sometimes
.
The
men
in
town
,
at
the
banks
and
the
county
*NL*
offices
,
seem
glad
to
see
me
.
I
think
,
myself
,
it
is
more
pleasant
*NL*
to
do
business
with
people
who
are
clean
and
healthy-looking
,
''
she
*NL*
admitted
blandly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carl
gave
a
little
chuckle
as
he
opened
the
Shabatas
'
gate
for
her
.
*NL*
``
Oh
,
do
you
?
''
he
asked
dryly
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
sign
of
life
about
the
Shabatas
'
house
except
a
big
*NL*
yellow
cat
,
sunning
itself
on
the
kitchen
doorstep
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alexandra
took
the
path
that
led
to
the
orchard
.
``
She
often
sits
*NL*
there
and
sews
.
I
did
n't
telephone
her
we
were
coming
,
because
I
*NL*
did
n't
want
her
to
go
to
work
and
bake
cake
and
freeze
ice-cream
.
*NL*
She
'll
always
make
a
party
if
you
give
her
the
least
excuse
.
Do
*NL*
you
recognize
the
apple
trees
,
Carl
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Linstrum
looked
about
him
.
``
I
wish
I
had
a
dollar
for
every
bucket
*NL*
of
water
I
've
carried
for
those
trees
.
Poor
father
,
he
was
an
*NL*
easy
man
,
but
he
was
perfectly
merciless
when
it
came
to
watering
*NL*
the
orchard
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
one
thing
I
like
about
Germans
;
they
make
an
orchard
grow
*NL*
if
they
ca
n't
make
anything
else
.
I
'm
so
glad
these
trees
belong
*NL*
to
some
one
who
takes
comfort
in
them
.
When
I
rented
this
place
,
*NL*
the
tenants
never
kept
the
orchard
up
,
and
Emil
and
I
used
to
come
*NL*
over
and
take
care
of
it
ourselves
.
It
needs
mowing
now
.
There
*NL*
she
is
,
down
in
the
corner
.
Maria-a-a
!
''
she
called
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
recumbent
figure
started
up
from
the
grass
and
came
running
toward
*NL*
them
through
the
flickering
screen
of
light
and
shade
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
at
her
!
Is
n't
she
like
a
little
brown
rabbit
?
''
Alexandra
*NL*
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Maria
ran
up
panting
and
threw
her
arms
about
Alexandra
.
``
Oh
,
I
*NL*
had
begun
to
think
you
were
not
coming
at
all
,
maybe
.
I
knew
you
*NL*
were
so
busy
.
Yes
,
Emil
told
me
about
Mr.
Linstrum
being
here
.
*NL*
Wo
n't
you
come
up
to
the
house
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
not
sit
down
there
in
your
corner
?
Carl
wants
to
see
the
*NL*
orchard
.
He
kept
all
these
trees
alive
for
years
,
watering
them
*NL*
with
his
own
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marie
turned
to
Carl
.
``
Then
I
'm
thankful
to
you
,
Mr.
Linstrum
.
We
'd
*NL*
never
have
bought
the
place
if
it
had
n't
been
for
this
orchard
,
and
*NL*
then
I
would
n't
have
had
Alexandra
,
either
.
''
She
gave
Alexandra
's
*NL*
arm
a
little
squeeze
as
she
walked
beside
her
.
``
How
nice
your
dress
*NL*
smells
,
Alexandra
;
you
put
rosemary
leaves
in
your
chest
,
like
I
*NL*
told
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
led
them
to
the
northwest
corner
of
the
orchard
,
sheltered
on
*NL*
one
side
by
a
thick
mulberry
hedge
and
bordered
on
the
other
by
a
*NL*
wheatfield
,
just
beginning
to
yellow
.
In
this
corner
the
ground
*NL*
dipped
a
little
,
and
the
blue-grass
,
which
the
weeds
had
driven
out
*NL*
in
the
upper
part
of
the
orchard
,
grew
thick
and
luxuriant
.
Wild
*NL*
roses
were
flaming
in
the
tufts
of
bunchgrass
along
the
fence
.
*NL*
Under
a
white
mulberry
tree
there
was
an
old
wagon-seat
.
Beside
*NL*
it
lay
a
book
and
a
workbasket
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
have
the
seat
,
Alexandra
.
The
grass
would
stain
your
*NL*
dress
,
''
the
hostess
insisted
.
She
dropped
down
on
the
ground
*NL*
at
Alexandra
's
side
and
tucked
her
feet
under
her
.
Carl
sat
at
*NL*
a
little
distance
from
the
two
women
,
his
back
to
the
wheatfield
,
*NL*
and
watched
them
.
Alexandra
took
off
her
shade-hat
and
threw
it
on
*NL*
the
ground
.
Marie
picked
it
up
and
played
with
the
white
ribbons
,
*NL*
twisting
them
about
her
brown
fingers
as
she
talked
.
They
made
a
*NL*
pretty
picture
in
the
strong
sunlight
,
the
leafy
pattern
surrounding
*NL*
them
like
a
net
;
the
Swedish
woman
so
white
and
gold
,
kindly
and
*NL*
amused
,
but
armored
in
calm
,
and
the
alert
brown
one
,
her
full
lips
*NL*
parted
,
points
of
yellow
light
dancing
in
her
eyes
as
she
laughed
*NL*
and
chattered
.
Carl
had
never
forgotten
little
Marie
Tovesky
's
*NL*
eyes
,
and
he
was
glad
to
have
an
opportunity
to
study
them
.
The
*NL*
brown
iris
,
he
found
,
was
curiously
slashed
with
yellow
,
the
color
*NL*
of
sunflower
honey
,
or
of
old
amber
.
In
each
eye
one
of
these
*NL*
streaks
must
have
been
larger
than
the
others
,
for
the
effect
was
*NL*
that
of
two
dancing
points
of
light
,
two
little
yellow
bubbles
,
*NL*
such
as
rise
in
a
glass
of
champagne
.
Sometimes
they
seemed
like
*NL*
the
sparks
from
a
forge
.
She
seemed
so
easily
excited
,
to
kindle
*NL*
with
a
fierce
little
flame
if
one
but
breathed
upon
her
.
``
What
*NL*
a
waste
,
''
Carl
reflected
.
``
She
ought
to
be
doing
all
that
for
a
*NL*
sweetheart
.
How
awkwardly
things
come
about
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
very
long
before
Marie
sprang
up
out
of
the
grass
again
.
*NL*
``
Wait
a
moment
.
I
want
to
show
you
something
.
''
She
ran
away
and
*NL*
disappeared
behind
the
low-growing
apple
trees
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
charming
creature
,
''
Carl
murmured
.
``
I
do
n't
wonder
that
*NL*
her
husband
is
jealous
.
But
ca
n't
she
walk
?
does
she
always
run
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alexandra
nodded
.
``
Always
.
I
do
n't
see
many
people
,
but
I
do
n't
*NL*
believe
there
are
many
like
her
,
anywhere
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marie
came
back
with
a
branch
she
had
broken
from
an
apricot
tree
,
*NL*
laden
with
pale
yellow
,
pink-cheeked
fruit
.
She
dropped
it
beside
*NL*
Carl
.
``
Did
you
plant
those
,
too
?
They
are
such
beautiful
little
*NL*
trees
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carl
fingered
the
blue-green
leaves
,
porous
like
blotting-paper
and
*NL*
shaped
like
birch
leaves
,
hung
on
waxen
red
stems
.
``
Yes
,
I
think
*NL*
I
did
.
Are
these
the
circus
trees
,
Alexandra
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
I
tell
her
about
them
?
''
Alexandra
asked
.
``
Sit
down
like
*NL*
a
good
girl
,
Marie
,
and
do
n't
ruin
my
poor
hat
,
and
I
'll
tell
you
*NL*
a
story
.
A
long
time
ago
,
when
Carl
and
I
were
,
say
,
sixteen
and
*NL*
twelve
,
a
circus
came
to
Hanover
and
we
went
to
town
in
our
wagon
,
*NL*
with
Lou
and
Oscar
,
to
see
the
parade
.
We
had
n't
money
enough
to
*NL*
go
to
the
circus
.
We
followed
the
parade
out
to
the
circus
grounds
*NL*
and
hung
around
until
the
show
began
and
the
crowd
went
inside
the
*NL*
tent
.
Then
Lou
was
afraid
we
looked
foolish
standing
outside
in
*NL*
the
pasture
,
so
we
went
back
to
Hanover
feeling
very
sad
.
There
*NL*
was
a
man
in
the
streets
selling
apricots
,
and
we
had
never
seen
*NL*
any
before
.
He
had
driven
down
from
somewhere
up
in
the
French
*NL*
country
,
and
he
was
selling
them
twenty-five
cents
a
peck
.
We
had
*NL*
a
little
money
our
fathers
had
given
us
for
candy
,
and
I
bought
*NL*
two
pecks
and
Carl
bought
one
.
They
cheered
us
a
good
deal
,
and
*NL*
we
saved
all
the
seeds
and
planted
them
.
Up
to
the
time
Carl
went
*NL*
away
,
they
had
n't
borne
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
he
's
come
back
to
eat
them
,
''
cried
Marie
,
nodding
at
Carl
.
*NL*
``
That
IS
a
good
story
.
I
can
remember
you
a
little
,
Mr.
Linstrum
.
*NL*
I
used
to
see
you
in
Hanover
sometimes
,
when
Uncle
Joe
took
me
to
*NL*
town
.
I
remember
you
because
you
were
always
buying
pencils
and
*NL*
tubes
of
paint
at
the
drug
store
.
Once
,
when
my
uncle
left
me
at
*NL*
the
store
,
you
drew
a
lot
of
little
birds
and
flowers
for
me
on
a
*NL*
piece
of
wrapping-paper
.
I
kept
them
for
a
long
while
.
I
thought
*NL*
you
were
very
romantic
because
you
could
draw
and
had
such
black
*NL*
eyes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carl
smiled
.
``
Yes
,
I
remember
that
time
.
Your
uncle
bought
you
*NL*
some
kind
of
a
mechanical
toy
,
a
Turkish
lady
sitting
on
an
ottoman
*NL*
and
smoking
a
hookah
,
was
n't
it
?
And
she
turned
her
head
backwards
*NL*
and
forwards
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
!
Was
n't
she
splendid
!
I
knew
well
enough
I
ought
not
*NL*
to
tell
Uncle
Joe
I
wanted
it
,
for
he
had
just
come
back
from
the
*NL*
saloon
and
was
feeling
good
.
You
remember
how
he
laughed
?
She
*NL*
tickled
him
,
too
.
But
when
we
got
home
,
my
aunt
scolded
him
for
*NL*
buying
toys
when
she
needed
so
many
things
.
We
wound
our
lady
up
*NL*
every
night
,
and
when
she
began
to
move
her
head
my
aunt
used
to
*NL*
laugh
as
hard
as
any
of
us
.
It
was
a
music-box
,
you
know
,
and
the
*NL*
Turkish
lady
played
a
tune
while
she
smoked
.
That
was
how
she
made
*NL*
you
feel
so
jolly
.
As
I
remember
her
,
she
was
lovely
,
and
had
a
*NL*
gold
crescent
on
her
turban
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Half
an
hour
later
,
as
they
were
leaving
the
house
,
Carl
and
Alexandra
*NL*
were
met
in
the
path
by
a
strapping
fellow
in
overalls
and
a
blue
*NL*
shirt
.
He
was
breathing
hard
,
as
if
he
had
been
running
,
and
was
*NL*
muttering
to
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marie
ran
forward
,
and
,
taking
him
by
the
arm
,
gave
him
a
little
*NL*
push
toward
her
guests
.
``
Frank
,
this
is
Mr.
Linstrum
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Frank
took
off
his
broad
straw
hat
and
nodded
to
Alexandra
.
When
*NL*
he
spoke
to
Carl
,
he
showed
a
fine
set
of
white
teeth
.
He
was
burned
*NL*
a
dull
red
down
to
his
neckband
,
and
there
was
a
heavy
three-days
'
*NL*
stubble
on
his
face
.
Even
in
his
agitation
he
was
handsome
,
but
*NL*
he
looked
a
rash
and
violent
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
Barely
saluting
the
callers
,
he
turned
at
once
to
his
wife
and
*NL*
began
,
in
an
outraged
tone
,
``
I
have
to
leave
my
team
to
drive
the
*NL*
old
woman
Hiller
's
hogs
out-a
my
wheat
.
I
go
to
take
dat
old
woman
*NL*
to
de
court
if
she
ai
n't
careful
,
I
tell
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
wife
spoke
soothingly
.
``
But
,
Frank
,
she
has
only
her
lame
boy
*NL*
to
help
her
.
She
does
the
best
she
can
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alexandra
looked
at
the
excited
man
and
offered
a
suggestion
.
``
Why
*NL*
do
n't
you
go
over
there
some
afternoon
and
hog-tight
her
fences
?
*NL*
You
'd
save
time
for
yourself
in
the
end
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Frank
's
neck
stiffened
.
``
Not-a-much
,
I
wo
n't
.
I
keep
my
hogs
*NL*
home
.
Other
peoples
can
do
like
me
.
See
?
If
that
Louis
can
mend
*NL*
shoes
,
he
can
mend
fence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Maybe
,
''
said
Alexandra
placidly
;
``
but
I
've
found
it
sometimes
pays
*NL*
to
mend
other
people
's
fences
.
Good-bye
,
Marie
.
Come
to
see
me
*NL*
soon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alexandra
walked
firmly
down
the
path
and
Carl
followed
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Frank
went
into
the
house
and
threw
himself
on
the
sofa
,
his
face
*NL*
to
the
wall
,
his
clenched
fist
on
his
hip
.
Marie
,
having
seen
her
*NL*
guests
off
,
came
in
and
put
her
hand
coaxingly
on
his
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
Frank
!
You
've
run
until
you
've
made
your
head
ache
,
now
*NL*
have
n't
you
?
Let
me
make
you
some
coffee
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
else
am
I
to
do
?
''
he
cried
hotly
in
Bohemian
.
``
Am
I
to
let
*NL*
any
old
woman
's
hogs
root
up
my
wheat
?
Is
that
what
I
work
myself
*NL*
to
death
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
worry
about
it
,
Frank
.
I
'll
speak
to
Mrs.
Hiller
again
.
*NL*
But
,
really
,
she
almost
cried
last
time
they
got
out
,
she
was
so
*NL*
sorry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Frank
bounced
over
on
his
other
side
.
``
That
's
it
;
you
always
side
*NL*
with
them
against
me
.
They
all
know
it
.
Anybody
here
feels
free
*NL*
to
borrow
the
mower
and
break
it
,
or
turn
their
hogs
in
on
me
.
*NL*
They
know
you
wo
n't
care
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marie
hurried
away
to
make
his
coffee
.
When
she
came
back
,
he
was
*NL*
fast
asleep
.
She
sat
down
and
looked
at
him
for
a
long
while
,
very
*NL*
thoughtfully
.
When
the
kitchen
clock
struck
six
she
went
out
to
*NL*
get
supper
,
closing
the
door
gently
behind
her
.
She
was
always
*NL*
sorry
for
Frank
when
he
worked
himself
into
one
of
these
rages
,
and
*NL*
she
was
sorry
to
have
him
rough
and
quarrelsome
with
his
neighbors
.
*NL*
She
was
perfectly
aware
that
the
neighbors
had
a
good
deal
to
put
*NL*
up
with
,
and
that
they
bore
with
Frank
for
her
sake
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
VII
*NL*
*NL*
Marie
's
father
,
Albert
Tovesky
,
was
one
of
the
more
intelligent
*NL*
Bohemians
who
came
West
in
the
early
seventies
.
He
settled
in
Omaha
*NL*
and
became
a
leader
and
adviser
among
his
people
there
.
Marie
was
*NL*
his
youngest
child
,
by
a
second
wife
,
and
was
the
apple
of
his
eye
.
*NL*
She
was
barely
sixteen
,
and
was
in
the
graduating
class
of
the
*NL*
Omaha
High
School
,
when
Frank
Shabata
arrived
from
the
old
country
*NL*
and
set
all
the
Bohemian
girls
in
a
flutter
.
He
was
easily
the
*NL*
buck
of
the
beer-gardens
,
and
on
Sunday
he
was
a
sight
to
see
,
with
*NL*
his
silk
hat
and
tucked
shirt
and
blue
frock-coat
,
wearing
gloves
*NL*
and
carrying
a
little
wisp
of
a
yellow
cane
.
He
was
tall
and
fair
,
*NL*
with
splendid
teeth
and
close-cropped
yellow
curls
,
and
he
wore
a
*NL*
slightly
disdainful
expression
,
proper
for
a
young
man
with
high
*NL*
connections
,
whose
mother
had
a
big
farm
in
the
Elbe
valley
.
There
*NL*
was
often
an
interesting
discontent
in
his
blue
eyes
,
and
every
*NL*
Bohemian
girl
he
met
imagined
herself
the
cause
of
that
unsatisfied
*NL*
expression
.
He
had
a
way
of
drawing
out
his
cambric
handkerchief
*NL*
slowly
,
by
one
corner
,
from
his
breast-pocket
,
that
was
melancholy
*NL*
and
romantic
in
the
extreme
.
He
took
a
little
flight
with
each
*NL*
of
the
more
eligible
Bohemian
girls
,
but
it
was
when
he
was
with
*NL*
little
Marie
Tovesky
that
he
drew
his
handkerchief
out
most
slowly
,
*NL*
and
,
after
he
had
lit
a
fresh
cigar
,
dropped
the
match
most
*NL*
despairingly
.
Any
one
could
see
,
with
half
an
eye
,
that
his
proud
*NL*
heart
was
bleeding
for
somebody
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
Sunday
,
late
in
the
summer
after
Marie
's
graduation
,
she
met
*NL*
Frank
at
a
Bohemian
picnic
down
the
river
and
went
rowing
with
him
*NL*
all
the
afternoon
.
When
she
got
home
that
evening
she
went
straight
*NL*
to
her
father
's
room
and
told
him
that
she
was
engaged
to
Shabata
.
*NL*
Old
Tovesky
was
having
a
comfortable
pipe
before
he
went
to
bed
.
*NL*
When
he
heard
his
daughter
's
announcement
,
he
first
prudently
*NL*
corked
his
beer
bottle
and
then
leaped
to
his
feet
and
had
a
turn
*NL*
of
temper
.
He
characterized
Frank
Shabata
by
a
Bohemian
expression
*NL*
which
is
the
equivalent
of
stuffed
shirt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
n't
he
go
to
work
like
the
rest
of
us
did
?
His
farm
in
the
*NL*
Elbe
valley
,
indeed
!
Ai
n't
he
got
plenty
brothers
and
sisters
?
*NL*
It
's
his
mother
's
farm
,
and
why
do
n't
he
stay
at
home
and
help
her
?
*NL*
Have
n't
I
seen
his
mother
out
in
the
morning
at
five
o'clock
with
*NL*
her
ladle
and
her
big
bucket
on
wheels
,
putting
liquid
manure
on
*NL*
the
cabbages
?
Do
n't
I
know
the
look
of
old
Eva
Shabata
's
hands
?
*NL*
Like
an
old
horse
's
hoofs
they
are
--
and
this
fellow
wearing
gloves
*NL*
and
rings
!
Engaged
,
indeed
!
You
are
n't
fit
to
be
out
of
school
,
*NL*
and
that
's
what
's
the
matter
with
you
.
I
will
send
you
off
to
the
*NL*
Sisters
of
the
Sacred
Heart
in
St.
Louis
,
and
they
will
teach
you
*NL*
some
sense
,
_
I
_
guess
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Accordingly
,
the
very
next
week
,
Albert
Tovesky
took
his
daughter
,
*NL*
pale
and
tearful
,
down
the
river
to
the
convent
.
But
the
way
to
*NL*
make
Frank
want
anything
was
to
tell
him
he
could
n't
have
it
.
He
*NL*
managed
to
have
an
interview
with
Marie
before
she
went
away
,
*NL*
and
whereas
he
had
been
only
half
in
love
with
her
before
,
he
now
*NL*
persuaded
himself
that
he
would
not
stop
at
anything
.
Marie
took
*NL*
with
her
to
the
convent
,
under
the
canvas
lining
of
her
trunk
,
the
*NL*
results
of
a
laborious
and
satisfying
morning
on
Frank
's
part
;
no
*NL*
less
than
a
dozen
photographs
of
himself
,
taken
in
a
dozen
different
*NL*
love-lorn
attitudes
.
There
was
a
little
round
photograph
for
her
*NL*
watch-case
,
photographs
for
her
wall
and
dresser
,
and
even
long
*NL*
narrow
ones
to
be
used
as
bookmarks
.
More
than
once
the
handsome
*NL*
gentleman
was
torn
to
pieces
before
the
French
class
by
an
indignant
*NL*
nun
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marie
pined
in
the
convent
for
a
year
,
until
her
eighteenth
birthday
*NL*
was
passed
.
Then
she
met
Frank
Shabata
in
the
Union
Station
in
*NL*
St.
Louis
and
ran
away
with
him
.
Old
Tovesky
forgave
his
daughter
*NL*
because
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
,
and
bought
her
a
farm
in
*NL*
the
country
that
she
had
loved
so
well
as
a
child
.
Since
then
her
*NL*
story
had
been
a
part
of
the
history
of
the
Divide
.
She
and
Frank
*NL*
had
been
living
there
for
five
years
when
Carl
Linstrum
came
back
*NL*
to
pay
his
long
deferred
visit
to
Alexandra
.
Frank
had
,
on
the
*NL*
whole
,
done
better
than
one
might
have
expected
.
He
had
flung
*NL*
himself
at
the
soil
with
savage
energy
.
Once
a
year
he
went
to
*NL*
Hastings
or
to
Omaha
,
on
a
spree
.
He
stayed
away
for
a
week
or
*NL*
two
,
and
then
came
home
and
worked
like
a
demon
.
He
did
work
;
if
*NL*
he
felt
sorry
for
himself
,
that
was
his
own
affair
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
VIII
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
evening
of
the
day
of
Alexandra
's
call
at
the
Shabatas
'
,
*NL*
a
heavy
rain
set
in
.
Frank
sat
up
until
a
late
hour
reading
the
*NL*
Sunday
newspapers
.
One
of
the
Goulds
was
getting
a
divorce
,
and
*NL*
Frank
took
it
as
a
personal
affront
.
In
printing
the
story
of
the
*NL*
young
man
's
marital
troubles
,
the
knowing
editor
gave
a
sufficiently
*NL*
colored
account
of
his
career
,
stating
the
amount
of
his
income
*NL*
and
the
manner
in
which
he
was
supposed
to
spend
it
.
Frank
read
*NL*
English
slowly
,
and
the
more
he
read
about
this
divorce
case
,
the
*NL*
angrier
he
grew
.
At
last
he
threw
down
the
page
with
a
snort
.
He
*NL*
turned
to
his
farm-hand
who
was
reading
the
other
half
of
the
paper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
God
!
if
I
have
that
young
feller
in
de
hayfield
once
,
I
show
*NL*
him
someting
.
Listen
here
what
he
do
wit
his
money
.
''
And
Frank
*NL*
began
the
catalogue
of
the
young
man
's
reputed
extravagances
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marie
sighed
.
She
thought
it
hard
that
the
Goulds
,
for
whom
she
*NL*
had
nothing
but
good
will
,
should
make
her
so
much
trouble
.
She
*NL*
hated
to
see
the
Sunday
newspapers
come
into
the
house
.
Frank
was
*NL*
always
reading
about
the
doings
of
rich
people
and
feeling
outraged
.
*NL*
He
had
an
inexhaustible
stock
of
stories
about
their
crimes
and
*NL*
follies
,
how
they
bribed
the
courts
and
shot
down
their
butlers
*NL*
with
impunity
whenever
they
chose
.
Frank
and
Lou
Bergson
had
very
*NL*
similar
ideas
,
and
they
were
two
of
the
political
agitators
of
the
*NL*
county
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
morning
broke
clear
and
brilliant
,
but
Frank
said
the
*NL*
ground
was
too
wet
to
plough
,
so
he
took
the
cart
and
drove
over
to
*NL*
Sainte-Agnes
to
spend
the
day
at
Moses
Marcel
's
saloon
.
After
he
*NL*
was
gone
,
Marie
went
out
to
the
back
porch
to
begin
her
butter-making
.
*NL*
A
brisk
wind
had
come
up
and
was
driving
puffy
white
clouds
across
*NL*
the
sky
.
The
orchard
was
sparkling
and
rippling
in
the
sun
.
Marie
*NL*
stood
looking
toward
it
wistfully
,
her
hand
on
the
lid
of
the
*NL*
churn
,
when
she
heard
a
sharp
ring
in
the
air
,
the
merry
sound
of
*NL*
the
whetstone
on
the
scythe
.
That
invitation
decided
her
.
She
ran
*NL*
into
the
house
,
put
on
a
short
skirt
and
a
pair
of
her
husband
's
*NL*
boots
,
caught
up
a
tin
pail
and
started
for
the
orchard
.
Emil
*NL*
had
already
begun
work
and
was
mowing
vigorously
.
When
he
saw
her
*NL*
coming
,
he
stopped
and
wiped
his
brow
.
His
yellow
canvas
leggings
*NL*
and
khaki
trousers
were
splashed
to
the
knees
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
let
me
disturb
you
,
Emil
.
I
'm
going
to
pick
cherries
.
*NL*
Is
n't
everything
beautiful
after
the
rain
?
Oh
,
but
I
'm
glad
to
get
*NL*
this
place
mowed
!
When
I
heard
it
raining
in
the
night
,
I
thought
*NL*
maybe
you
would
come
and
do
it
for
me
to-day
.
The
wind
wakened
*NL*
me
.
Did
n't
it
blow
dreadfully
?
Just
smell
the
wild
roses
!
They
*NL*
are
always
so
spicy
after
a
rain
.
We
never
had
so
many
of
them
*NL*
in
here
before
.
I
suppose
it
's
the
wet
season
.
Will
you
have
to
*NL*
cut
them
,
too
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
cut
the
grass
,
I
will
,
''
Emil
said
teasingly
.
``
What
's
the
*NL*
matter
with
you
?
What
makes
you
so
flighty
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Am
I
flighty
?
I
suppose
that
's
the
wet
season
,
too
,
then
.
It
's
*NL*
exciting
to
see
everything
growing
so
fast
,
--
and
to
get
the
grass
*NL*
cut
!
Please
leave
the
roses
till
last
,
if
you
must
cut
them
.
Oh
,
*NL*
I
do
n't
mean
all
of
them
,
I
mean
that
low
place
down
by
my
tree
,
where
*NL*
there
are
so
many
.
Are
n't
you
splashed
!
Look
at
the
spider-webs
*NL*
all
over
the
grass
.
Good-bye
.
I
'll
call
you
if
I
see
a
snake
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
tripped
away
and
Emil
stood
looking
after
her
.
In
a
few
moments
*NL*
he
heard
the
cherries
dropping
smartly
into
the
pail
,
and
he
began
*NL*
to
swing
his
scythe
with
that
long
,
even
stroke
that
few
American
*NL*
boys
ever
learn
.
Marie
picked
cherries
and
sang
softly
to
herself
,
*NL*
stripping
one
glittering
branch
after
another
,
shivering
when
she
*NL*
caught
a
shower
of
raindrops
on
her
neck
and
hair
.
And
Emil
mowed
*NL*
his
way
slowly
down
toward
the
cherry
trees
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
summer
the
rains
had
been
so
many
and
opportune
that
it
was
*NL*
almost
more
than
Shabata
and
his
man
could
do
to
keep
up
with
the
*NL*
corn
;
the
orchard
was
a
neglected
wilderness
.
All
sorts
of
weeds
and
*NL*
herbs
and
flowers
had
grown
up
there
;
splotches
of
wild
larkspur
,
*NL*
pale
green-and-white
spikes
of
hoarhound
,
plantations
of
wild
*NL*
cotton
,
tangles
of
foxtail
and
wild
wheat
.
South
of
the
apricot
*NL*
trees
,
cornering
on
the
wheatfield
,
was
Frank
's
alfalfa
,
where
*NL*
myriads
of
white
and
yellow
butterflies
were
always
fluttering
*NL*
above
the
purple
blossoms
.
When
Emil
reached
the
lower
corner
by
*NL*
the
hedge
,
Marie
was
sitting
under
her
white
mulberry
tree
,
the
*NL*
pailful
of
cherries
beside
her
,
looking
off
at
the
gentle
,
tireless
*NL*
swelling
of
the
wheat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Emil
,
''
she
said
suddenly
--
he
was
mowing
quietly
about
under
the
*NL*
tree
so
as
not
to
disturb
her
--
``
what
religion
did
the
Swedes
have
*NL*
away
back
,
before
they
were
Christians
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Emil
paused
and
straightened
his
back
.
``
I
do
n't
know
.
About
like
*NL*
the
Germans
'
,
was
n't
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marie
went
on
as
if
she
had
not
heard
him
.
``
The
Bohemians
,
you
*NL*
know
,
were
tree
worshipers
before
the
missionaries
came
.
Father
says
*NL*
the
people
in
the
mountains
still
do
queer
things
,
sometimes
,
--
they
*NL*
believe
that
trees
bring
good
or
bad
luck
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Emil
looked
superior
.
``
Do
they
?
Well
,
which
are
the
lucky
trees
?
*NL*
I
'd
like
to
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
all
of
them
,
but
I
know
lindens
are
.
The
old
people
*NL*
in
the
mountains
plant
lindens
to
purify
the
forest
,
and
to
do
away
*NL*
with
the
spells
that
come
from
the
old
trees
they
say
have
lasted
*NL*
from
heathen
times
.
I
'm
a
good
Catholic
,
but
I
think
I
could
get
*NL*
along
with
caring
for
trees
,
if
I
had
n't
anything
else
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
a
poor
saying
,
''
said
Emil
,
stooping
over
to
wipe
his
hands
*NL*
in
the
wet
grass
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
is
it
?
If
I
feel
that
way
,
I
feel
that
way
.
I
like
trees
*NL*
because
they
seem
more
resigned
to
the
way
they
have
to
live
than
*NL*
other
things
do
.
I
feel
as
if
this
tree
knows
everything
I
ever
*NL*
think
of
when
I
sit
here
.
When
I
come
back
to
it
,
I
never
have
to
*NL*
remind
it
of
anything
;
I
begin
just
where
I
left
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Emil
had
nothing
to
say
to
this
.
He
reached
up
among
the
branches
*NL*
and
began
to
pick
the
sweet
,
insipid
fruit
,
--
long
ivory-colored
*NL*
berries
,
tipped
with
faint
pink
,
like
white
coral
,
that
fall
to
*NL*
the
ground
unheeded
all
summer
through
.
He
dropped
a
handful
into
*NL*
her
lap
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
like
Mr.
Linstrum
?
''
Marie
asked
suddenly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
Do
n't
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
ever
so
much
;
only
he
seems
kind
of
staid
and
school-teachery
.
*NL*
But
,
of
course
,
he
is
older
than
Frank
,
even
.
I
'm
sure
I
do
n't
*NL*
want
to
live
to
be
more
than
thirty
,
do
you
?
Do
you
think
Alexandra
*NL*
likes
him
very
much
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
so
.
They
were
old
friends
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Emil
,
you
know
what
I
mean
!
''
Marie
tossed
her
head
impatiently
.
*NL*
``
Does
she
really
care
about
him
?
When
she
used
to
tell
me
about
*NL*
him
,
I
always
wondered
whether
she
was
n't
a
little
in
love
with
*NL*
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
,
Alexandra
?
''
Emil
laughed
and
thrust
his
hands
into
his
*NL*
trousers
pockets
.
``
Alexandra
's
never
been
in
love
,
you
crazy
!
''
He
*NL*
laughed
again
.
``
She
would
n't
know
how
to
go
about
it
.
The
idea
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marie
shrugged
her
shoulders
.
``
Oh
,
you
do
n't
know
Alexandra
as
well
*NL*
as
you
think
you
do
!
If
you
had
any
eyes
,
you
would
see
that
she
*NL*
is
very
fond
of
him
.
It
would
serve
you
all
right
if
she
walked
*NL*
off
with
Carl
.
I
like
him
because
he
appreciates
her
more
than
*NL*
you
do

''
*NL*
*NL*
Emil
frowned
.
``
What
are
you
talking
about
,
Marie
?
Alexandra
's
*NL*
all
right
.
She
and
I
have
always
been
good
friends
.
What
more
do
*NL*
you
want
?
I
like
to
talk
to
Carl
about
New
York
and
what
a
fellow
*NL*
can
do
there
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Emil
!
Surely
you
are
not
thinking
of
going
off
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
not
?
I
must
go
somewhere
,
must
n't
I
?
''
The
young
man
took
up
*NL*
his
scythe
and
leaned
on
it
.
``
Would
you
rather
I
went
off
in
the
*NL*
sand
hills
and
lived
like
Ivar
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marie
's
face
fell
under
his
brooding
gaze
.
She
looked
down
at
his
*NL*
wet
leggings
.
``
I
'm
sure
Alexandra
hopes
you
will
stay
on
here
,
''
*NL*
she
murmured
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
Alexandra
will
be
disappointed
,
''
the
young
man
said
roughly
.
*NL*
``
What
do
I
want
to
hang
around
here
for

Alexandra
can
run
the
*NL*
farm
all
right

without
me
.
I
do
n't
want
to
stand
around
and
look

on

I
want
to
be
doing
something
on
my
own
account

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
so

Marie
sighed
.
``
There
are
so
many

many
things
you

can
do

Almost
anything
you
choose

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
there
are
so
many

many
things

Emil
echoed
her
*NL*
tone
sarcastically
.
``
Sometimes
I
do
n't
want
to
do
anything
at

all

sometimes
I
want
to
pull
the
four
corners
of
the
Divide
*NL*
together

--
he
threw
out
his
arm
and
brought
it
back
with
a
jerk
,
--
``
so
,
*NL*
like
a
table-cloth

get
tired
of
seeing
men

horses
going
up

down

up
and
down

*NL*
Marie
looked
up
at
his
defiant
figure
and
her
face
clouded
.
``
I

so
restless

so
worked
up
over

said
sadly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you

he
returned
shortly
.

*NL*
She
sighed
despondently
.
``
Everything
I
say
makes
you
cross

do

*NL*
it

And
you
never
used
to
be
cross
to
me

''
*NL*
*NL*
Emil
took
a
step
nearer
and
stood
frowning
down
at
her
bent
head
.
*NL*
He
stood
in
an
attitude
of
self-defense
,
his
feet
well
apart
,
his
*NL*
hands
clenched
and
drawn
up
at
his
sides
,
so
that
the
cords
stood
*NL*
out
on
his
bare
arms
.
``
I
ca
n't
play
with
you
like
a
little
boy
*NL*
any
more

he
said
slowly
.
``
That
's
what
you
miss

Marie

You
'll
*NL*
have
to
get
some
other
little
boy
to
play
with
.
''
He
stopped
and
took
*NL*
a
deep
breath
.
Then
he
went
on
in
a
low
tone
,
so
intense
that
it
*NL*
was
almost
threatening
:
``
Sometimes
you
seem
to
understand
perfectly

then
sometimes
you
pretend

You
do

help
things

any
by
pretending

It

corners

the
Divide

If

make
you

*NL*
*NL*
Marie
clasped
her
hands
and
started
up
from
her
seat
.
She
had
grown
*NL*
very
pale
and
her
eyes
were
shining
with
excitement
and
distress
.
*NL*
``
But

She
struck
the
ground
with
her
little
foot
fiercely
.
``

go

She
spoke
rapidly
and
pleadingly

looked
entreatingly
into
his
*NL*
face

Emil
stood
defiant

gazing
down
at
her

Marie
turned
away

wringing
her
hands

*NL*
*NL*
Emil
gripped
the
hand-holds
of
his
scythe
and
began
to
mow
.
Marie
*NL*
took
up
her
cherries

went
slowly
toward

house

crying

bitterly

IX
*NL*
*NL*
On
Sunday
afternoon
,
a
month
after
Carl
Linstrum
's
arrival
,
he
rode
*NL*
with
Emil
up
into
the
French
country
to
attend
a
Catholic
fair
.
He
*NL*
sat
for
most
of
the
afternoon
in
the
basement
of
the
church
,
where
*NL*
the
fair
was
held
,
talking
to
Marie
Shabata
,
or
strolled
about
the
*NL*
gravel
terrace
,
thrown
up
on
the
hillside
in
front
of
the
basement
*NL*
doors
,
where
the
French
boys
were
jumping
and
wrestling
and
throwing
*NL*
the
discus
.
Some
of
the
boys
were
in
their
white
baseball
suits
;
*NL*
they
had
just
come
up
from
a
Sunday
practice
game
down
in
the
*NL*
ballgrounds
.
Amedee
,
the
newly
married
,
Emil
's
best
friend
,
was
*NL*
their
pitcher
,
renowned
among
the
country
towns
for
his
dash
and
*NL*
skill
.
Amedee
was
a
little
fellow
,
a
year
younger
than
Emil
and
*NL*
much
more
boyish
in
appearance
;
very
lithe
and
active
and
neatly
*NL*
made
,
with
a
clear
brown
and
white
skin
,
and
flashing
white
teeth
.
*NL*
The
Sainte-Agnes
boys
were
to
play
the
Hastings
nine
in
a
fortnight
,
*NL*
and
Amedee
's
lightning
balls
were
the
hope
of
his
team
.
The
little
*NL*
Frenchman
seemed
to
get
every
ounce
there
was
in
him
behind
the
*NL*
ball
as
it
left
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'd
have
made
the
battery
at
the
University
for
sure
,
`
Medee
,
''
*NL*
Emil
said
as
they
were
walking
from
the
ball-grounds
back
to
the
*NL*
church
on
the
hill
.
``
You
're
pitching
better
than
you
did
in
the
*NL*
spring
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Amedee
grinned
.
``
Sure
!
A
married
man
do
n't
lose
his
head
no
more
.
''
*NL*
He
slapped
Emil
on
the
back
as
he
caught
step
with
him
.
``
Oh
,
Emil
,
*NL*
you
wan
na
get
married
right
off
quick
!
It
's
the
greatest
thing
*NL*
ever
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Emil
laughed
.
``
How
am
I
going
to
get
married
without
any
girl
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Amedee
took
his
arm
.
``
Pooh
!
There
are
plenty
girls
will
have
*NL*
you
.
You
wan
na
get
some
nice
French
girl
,
now
.
She
treat
you
well
;
*NL*
always
be
jolly
.
See
,
''
--
he
began
checking
off
on
his
fingers
,
--
``
there
*NL*
is
Severine
,
and
Alphosen
,
and
Josephine
,
and
Hectorine
,
and
Louise
,
*NL*
and
Malvina
--
why
,
I
could
love
any
of
them
girls
!
Why
do
n't
you
*NL*
get
after
them
?
Are
you
stuck
up
,
Emil
,
or
is
anything
the
matter
*NL*
with
you
?
I
never
did
know
a
boy
twenty-two
years
old
before
that
*NL*
did
n't
have
no
girl
.
You
wan
na
be
a
priest
,
maybe
?
Not-a
for
me
!
''
*NL*
Amedee
swaggered
.
``
I
bring
many
good
Catholics
into
this
world
,
*NL*
I
hope
,
and
that
's
a
way
I
help
the
Church
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Emil
looked
down
and
patted
him
on
the
shoulder
.
``
Now
you
're
windy
,
*NL*
`
Medee
.
You
Frenchies
like
to
brag
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Amedee
had
the
zeal
of
the
newly
married
,
and
he
was
not
*NL*
to
be
lightly
shaken
off
.
``
Honest
and
true
,
Emil
,
do
n't
you
want
*NL*
ANY
girl
?
Maybe
there
's
some
young
lady
in
Lincoln
,
now
,
very
*NL*
grand
,
''
--
Amedee
waved
his
hand
languidly
before
his
face
to
denote
*NL*
the
fan
of
heartless
beauty
,
--
``
and
you
lost
your
heart
up
there
.
*NL*
Is
that
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Maybe
,
''
said
Emil
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Amedee
saw
no
appropriate
glow
in
his
friend
's
face
.
``
Bah
!
''
*NL*
he
exclaimed
in
disgust
.
``
I
tell
all
the
French
girls
to
keep
`
way
*NL*
from
you
.
You
got
ta
rock
in
there
,
''
thumping
Emil
on
the
ribs
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
reached
the
terrace
at
the
side
of
the
church
,
Amedee
,
*NL*
who
was
excited
by
his
success
on
the
ball-grounds
,
challenged
*NL*
Emil
to
a
jumping-match
,
though
he
knew
he
would
be
beaten
.
They
*NL*
belted
themselves
up
,
and
Raoul
Marcel
,
the
choir
tenor
and
Father
*NL*
Duchesne
's
pet
,
and
Jean
Bordelau
,
held
the
string
over
which
they
*NL*
vaulted
.
All
the
French
boys
stood
round
,
cheering
and
humping
*NL*
themselves
up
when
Emil
or
Amedee
went
over
the
wire
,
as
if
they
*NL*
were
helping
in
the
lift
.
Emil
stopped
at
five-feet-five
,
declaring
*NL*
that
he
would
spoil
his
appetite
for
supper
if
he
jumped
any
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
Angelique
,
Amedee
's
pretty
bride
,
as
blonde
and
fair
as
her
name
,
*NL*
who
had
come
out
to
watch
the
match
,
tossed
her
head
at
Emil
and
*NL*
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Medee
could
jump
much
higher
than
you
if
he
were
as
tall
.
And
*NL*
anyhow
,
he
is
much
more
graceful
.
He
goes
over
like
a
bird
,
and
*NL*
you
have
to
hump
yourself
all
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
do
,
do
I
?
''
Emil
caught
her
and
kissed
her
saucy
mouth
squarely
,
*NL*
while
she
laughed
and
struggled
and
called
,
''
`
Medee
!
`
Medee
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
you
see
your
`
Medee
is
n't
even
big
enough
to
get
you
away
*NL*
from
me
.
I
could
run
away
with
you
right
now
and
he
could
only
*NL*
sit
down
and
cry
about
it
.
I
'll
show
you
whether
I
have
to
hump
*NL*
myself
!
''
Laughing
and
panting
,
he
picked
Angelique
up
in
his
arms
*NL*
and
began
running
about
the
rectangle
with
her
.
Not
until
he
saw
*NL*
Marie
Shabata
's
tiger
eyes
flashing
from
the
gloom
of
the
basement
*NL*
doorway
did
he
hand
the
disheveled
bride
over
to
her
husband
.
*NL*
``
There
,
go
to
your
graceful
;
I
have
n't
the
heart
to
take
you
away
*NL*
from
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Angelique
clung
to
her
husband
and
made
faces
at
Emil
over
the
*NL*
white
shoulder
of
Amedee
's
ball-shirt
.
Emil
was
greatly
amused
at
*NL*
her
air
of
proprietorship
and
at
Amedee
's
shameless
submission
to
*NL*
it
.
He
was
delighted
with
his
friend
's
good
fortune
.
He
liked
to
*NL*
see
and
to
think
about
Amedee
's
sunny
,
natural
,
happy
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
and
Amedee
had
ridden
and
wrestled
and
larked
together
since
*NL*
they
were
lads
of
twelve
.
On
Sundays
and
holidays
they
were
always
*NL*
arm
in
arm
.
It
seemed
strange
that
now
he
should
have
to
hide
the
*NL*
thing
that
Amedee
was
so
proud
of
,
that
the
feeling
which
gave
one
*NL*
of
them
such
happiness
should
bring
the
other
such
despair
.
It
*NL*
was
like
that
when
Alexandra
tested
her
seed-corn
in
the
spring
,
*NL*
he
mused
.
From
two
ears
that
had
grown
side
by
side
,
the
grains
*NL*
of
one
shot
up
joyfully
into
the
light
,
projecting
themselves
into
*NL*
the
future
,
and
the
grains
from
the
other
lay
still
in
the
earth
*NL*
and
rotted
;
and
nobody
knew
why
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
X
*NL*
*NL*
While
Emil
and
Carl
were
amusing
themselves
at
the
fair
,
Alexandra
*NL*
was
at
home
,
busy
with
her
account-books
,
which
had
been
neglected
*NL*
of
late
.
She
was
almost
through
with
her
figures
when
she
heard
*NL*
a
cart
drive
up
to
the
gate
,
and
looking
out
of
the
window
she
saw
*NL*
her
two
older
brothers
.
They
had
seemed
to
avoid
her
ever
since
*NL*
Carl
Linstrum
's
arrival
,
four
weeks
ago
that
day
,
and
she
hurried
*NL*
to
the
door
to
welcome
them
.
She
saw
at
once
that
they
had
come
*NL*
with
some
very
definite
purpose
.
They
followed
her
stiffly
into
*NL*
the
sitting-room
.
Oscar
sat
down
,
but
Lou
walked
over
to
the
window
*NL*
and
remained
standing
,
his
hands
behind
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
by
yourself
?
''
he
asked
,
looking
toward
the
doorway
into
*NL*
the
parlor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
Carl
and
Emil
went
up
to
the
Catholic
fair
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
few
moments
neither
of
the
men
spoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Lou
came
out
sharply
.
``
How
soon
does
he
intend
to
go
away
*NL*
from
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
Lou
.
Not
for
some
time
,
I
hope
.
''
Alexandra
spoke
*NL*
in
an
even
,
quiet
tone
that
often
exasperated
her
brothers
.
They
*NL*
felt
that
she
was
trying
to
be
superior
with
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oscar
spoke
up
grimly
.
``
We
thought
we
ought
to
tell
you
that
people
*NL*
have
begun
to
talk
,
''
he
said
meaningly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alexandra
looked
at
him
.
``
What
about
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Oscar
met
her
eyes
blankly
.
``
About
you
,
keeping
him
here
so
long
.
*NL*
It
looks
bad
for
him
to
be
hanging
on
to
a
woman
this
way
.
People
*NL*
think
you
're
getting
taken
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alexandra
shut
her
account-book
firmly
.
``
Boys
,
''
she
said
seriously
,
*NL*
``
do
n't
let
's
go
on
with
this
.
We
wo
n't
come
out
anywhere
.
I
ca
n't
*NL*
take
advice
on
such
a
matter
.
I
know
you
mean
well
,
but
you
must
*NL*
not
feel
responsible
for
me
in
things
of
this
sort
.
If
we
go
on
*NL*
with
this
talk
it
will
only
make
hard
feeling
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lou
whipped
about
from
the
window
.
``
You
ought
to
think
a
little
*NL*
about
your
family
.
You
're
making
us
all
ridiculous
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
am
I
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
People
are
beginning
to
say
you
want
to
marry
the
fellow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
and
what
is
ridiculous
about
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lou
and
Oscar
exchanged
outraged
looks
.
``
Alexandra
!
Ca
n't
you
*NL*
see
he
's
just
a
tramp
and
he
's
after
your
money
?
He
wants
to
be
*NL*
taken
care
of
,
he
does
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
suppose
I
want
to
take
care
of
him
?
Whose
business
is
it
*NL*
but
my
own
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
know
he
'd
get
hold
of
your
property
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
'd
get
hold
of
what
I
wished
to
give
him
,
certainly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Oscar
sat
up
suddenly
and
Lou
clutched
at
his
bristly
hair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
him
?
''
Lou
shouted
.
``
Our
property
,
our
homestead
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
about
the
homestead
,
''
said
Alexandra
quietly
.
``
I
*NL*
know
you
and
Oscar
have
always
expected
that
it
would
be
left
to
*NL*
your
children
,
and
I
'm
not
sure
but
what
you
're
right
.
But
I
'll
*NL*
do
exactly
as
I
please
with
the
rest
of
my
land
,
boys
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
rest
of
your
land
!
''
cried
Lou
,
growing
more
excited
every
*NL*
minute
.
``
Did
n't
all
the
land
come
out
of
the
homestead
?
It
was
*NL*
bought
with
money
borrowed
on
the
homestead
,
and
Oscar
and
me
worked
*NL*
ourselves
to
the
bone
paying
interest
on
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
you
paid
the
interest
.
But
when
you
married
we
made
a
division
*NL*
of
the
land
,
and
you
were
satisfied
.
I
've
made
more
on
my
farms
*NL*
since
I
've
been
alone
than
when
we
all
worked
together
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Everything
you
've
made
has
come
out
of
the
original
land
that
us
*NL*
boys
worked
for
,
has
n't
it
?
The
farms
and
all
that
comes
out
of
*NL*
them
belongs
to
us
as
a
family

*NL*
*NL*
Alexandra
waved
her
hand
impatiently
.
``
Come
now
,
Lou
.
Stick
to
*NL*
the
facts

You
are
talking
nonsense

Go
to
the
county
clerk
and
*NL*
ask
him
who
owns
my
land

and
whether
my
titles
are
good

*NL*
*NL*
Lou
turned
to
his
brother
.
``
This
is
what
comes
of
letting
a
woman
*NL*
meddle
in
business
,
''
he
said
bitterly
.
``
We
ought
to
have
taken
*NL*
things
in
our
own
hands
years
ago

But
she
liked
to
run
things

*NL*
and
we
humored
her
.
We
thought
you
had
good
sense
,
Alexandra
.
We
*NL*
never
thought
you
'd
do
anything
foolish

*NL*
*NL*
Alexandra
rapped
impatiently
on
her
desk
with
her
knuckles
.
*NL*
``
Listen
,
Lou

Do
n't
talk
wild

You
say
you
ought

have
taken
*NL*
things
into
your
own
hands
years
ago

I
suppose
you
mean
before
*NL*
you
left
home
.
But
how
could
you
take
hold
of
what
was
n't
there
?
*NL*
I
've
got
most
of
what
I
have
now
since
we
divided
the
property
;
*NL*
I
've
built
it
up
myself
,
and
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Oscar
spoke
up
solemnly
.
``
The
property
of
a
family
really
belongs
*NL*
to
the
men
of
the
family
,
no
matter
about
the
title
.
If
anything
*NL*
goes
wrong
,
it
's
the
men
that
are
held
responsible

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
of
course

Lou
broke
in
.
``
Everybody
knows
that
.
Oscar
and
*NL*
me
have
always
been
easy-going
and
we
've
never
made
any
fuss

We
*NL*
were
willing
you
should
hold
the
land
and
have
the
good
of
it
,
but
*NL*
you
got
no
right
to
part
with
any
of
it

We
worked
in
the
fields
*NL*
to
pay
for
the
first
land
you
bought
,
and
whatever
's
come
out
of
*NL*
it
has
got
to
be
kept
in
the
family

''
*NL*
*NL*
Oscar
reinforced
his
brother
,
his
mind
fixed
on
the
one
point
he
*NL*
could
see
.
``
The
property
of
a
family
belongs
to
the
men
of
the
*NL*
family
,
because
they
are
held
responsible
,
and
because
they
do
the
*NL*
work
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alexandra
looked
from
one
to
the
other
,
her
eyes
full
of
indignation
.
*NL*
She
had
been
impatient
before
,
but
now
she
was
beginning
to
feel
*NL*
angry
.
``
And
what
about
my
work
?
''
she
asked
in
an
unsteady
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lou
looked
at
the
carpet
.
``
Oh
,
now
,
Alexandra
,
you
always
took
*NL*
it
pretty
easy
!
Of
course
we
wanted
you
to
.
You
liked
to
manage
*NL*
round
,
and
we
always
humored
you
.
We
realize
you
were
a
great
*NL*
deal
of
help
to
us
.
There
's
no
woman
anywhere
around
that
knows
*NL*
as
much
about
business
as
you
do
,
and
we
've
always
been
proud
of
*NL*
that
,
and
thought
you
were
pretty
smart
.
But
,
of
course
,
the
real
*NL*
work
always
fell
on
us
.
Good
advice
is
all
right
,
but
it
do
n't
*NL*
get
the
weeds
out
of
the
corn
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Maybe
not
,
but
it
sometimes
puts
in
the
crop
,
and
it
sometimes
*NL*
keeps
the
fields
for
corn
to
grow
in
,
''
said
Alexandra
dryly
.
``
Why
,
*NL*
Lou
,
I
can
remember
when
you
and
Oscar
wanted
to
sell
this
homestead
*NL*
and
all
the
improvements
to
old
preacher
Ericson
for
two
thousand
*NL*
dollars
.
If
I
'd
consented
,
you
'd
have
gone
down
to
the
river
and
*NL*
scraped
along
on
poor
farms
for
the
rest
of
your
lives
.
When
I
put
*NL*
in
our
first
field
of
alfalfa
you
both
opposed
me
,
just
because
I
*NL*
first
heard
about
it
from
a
young
man
who
had
been
to
the
University
.
*NL*
You
said
I
was
being
taken
in
then
,
and
all
the
neighbors
said
*NL*
so
.
You
know
as
well
as
I
do
that
alfalfa
has
been
the
salvation
*NL*
of
this
country
.
You
all
laughed
at
me
when
I
said
our
land
here
*NL*
was
about
ready
for
wheat
,
and
I
had
to
raise
three
big
wheat
crops
*NL*
before
the
neighbors
quit
putting
all
their
land
in
corn
.
Why
,
I
*NL*
remember
you
cried
,
Lou
,
when
we
put
in
the
first
big
wheat-planting
,
*NL*
and
said
everybody
was
laughing
at
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lou
turned
to
Oscar
.
``
That
's
the
woman
of
it
;
if
she
tells
you
to
*NL*
put
in
a
crop
,
she
thinks
she
's
put
it
in
.
It
makes
women
conceited
*NL*
to
meddle
in
business
.
I
should
n't
think
you
'd
want
to
remind
us
*NL*
how
hard
you
were
on
us
,
Alexandra
,
after
the
way
you
baby
Emil
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hard
on
you
?
I
never
meant
to
be
hard
.
Conditions
were
hard
.
*NL*
Maybe
I
would
never
have
been
very
soft
,
anyhow
;
but
I
certainly
*NL*
did
n't
choose
to
be
the
kind
of
girl
I
was
.
If
you
take
even
a
*NL*
vine
and
cut
it
back
again
and
again
,
it
grows
hard
,
like
a
tree
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lou
felt
that
they
were
wandering
from
the
point
,
and
that
*NL*
in
digression
Alexandra
might
unnerve
him
.
He
wiped
his
forehead
*NL*
with
a
jerk
of
his
handkerchief
.
``
We
never
doubted
you
,
Alexandra
.
*NL*
We
never
questioned
anything
you
did
.
You
've
always
had
your
own
*NL*
way
.
But
you
ca
n't
expect
us
to
sit
like
stumps
and
see
you
done
*NL*
out
of
the
property
by
any
loafer
who
happens
along
,
and
making
*NL*
yourself
ridiculous
into
the
bargain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Oscar
rose
.
``
Yes
,
''
he
broke
in
,
``
everybody
's
laughing
to
see
you
*NL*
get
took
in
;
at
your
age
,
too
.
Everybody
knows
he
's
nearly
five
*NL*
years
younger
than
you
,
and
is
after
your
money
.
Why
,
Alexandra
,
*NL*
you
are
forty
years
old
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
that
does
n't
concern
anybody
but
Carl
and
me
.
Go
to
town
and
*NL*
ask
your
lawyers
what
you
can
do
to
restrain
me
from
disposing
of
*NL*
my
own
property
.
And
I
advise
you
to
do
what
they
tell
you
;
for
*NL*
the
authority
you
can
exert
by
law
is
the
only
influence
you
will
*NL*
ever
have
over
me
again
.
''
Alexandra
rose
.
``
I
think
I
would
rather
*NL*
not
have
lived
to
find
out
what
I
have
to-day
,
''
she
said
quietly
,
*NL*
closing
her
desk
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lou
and
Oscar
looked
at
each
other
questioningly
.
There
seemed
to
*NL*
be
nothing
to
do
but
to
go
,
and
they
walked
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ca
n't
do
business
with
women
,
''
Oscar
said
heavily
as
he
*NL*
clambered
into
the
cart
.
``
But
anyhow
,
we
've
had
our
say
,
at
last
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lou
scratched
his
head
.
``
Talk
of
that
kind
might
come
too
high
,
you
*NL*
know
;
but
she
's
apt
to
be
sensible
.
You
had
n't
ought
to
said
that
*NL*
about
her
age
,
though
,
Oscar
.
I
'm
afraid
that
hurt
her
feelings
;
*NL*
and
the
worst
thing
we
can
do
is
to
make
her
sore
at
us
.
She
'd
*NL*
marry
him
out
of
contrariness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
only
meant
,
''
said
Oscar
,
``
that
she
is
old
enough
to
know
better
,
*NL*
and
she
is
.
If
she
was
going
to
marry
,
she
ought
to
done
it
long
*NL*
ago
,
and
not
go
making
a
fool
of
herself
now

''
*NL*
*NL*
Lou
looked
anxious
,
nevertheless
.
``
Of
course
,
''
he
reflected
hopefully
*NL*
and
inconsistently
,
``
Alexandra
ai
n't
much
like
other
women-folks
.
*NL*
Maybe
it
wo
n't
make
her
sore

Maybe
she
'd
as
soon
be
forty
as
*NL*
not
!

*NL*
XI
*NL*
*NL*
Emil
came
home
at
about
half-past
seven
o'clock
that
evening
.
Old
*NL*
Ivar
met
him
at
the
windmill
and
took
his
horse
,
and
the
young
*NL*
man
went
directly
into
the
house
.
He
called
to
his
sister
and
she
*NL*
answered
from
her
bedroom
,
behind
the
sitting-room
,
saying
that
*NL*
she
was
lying
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
Emil
went
to
her
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
I
see
you
for
a
minute
?
''
he
asked
.
``
I
want
to
talk
to
you
*NL*
about
something
before
Carl
comes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alexandra
rose
quickly
and
came
to
the
door
.
``
Where
is
Carl
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lou
and
Oscar
met
us
and
said
they
wanted
to
talk
to
him
,
so
he
*NL*
rode
over
to
Oscar
's
with
them
.
Are
you
coming
out
?
''
Emil
asked
*NL*
impatiently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sit
down
.
I
'll
be
dressed
in
a
moment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alexandra
closed
her
door
,
and
Emil
sank
down
on
the
old
slat
lounge
*NL*
and
sat
with
his
head
in
his
hands
.
When
his
sister
came
out
,
he
*NL*
looked
up
,
not
knowing
whether
the
interval
had
been
short
or
long
,
*NL*
and
he
was
surprised
to
see
that
the
room
had
grown
quite
dark
.
*NL*
That
was
just
as
well
;
it
would
be
easier
to
talk
if
he
were
not
*NL*
under
the
gaze
of
those
clear
,
deliberate
eyes
,
that
saw
so
far
in
*NL*
some
directions
and
were
so
blind
in
others
.
Alexandra
,
too
,
was
*NL*
glad
of
the
dusk
.
Her
face
was
swollen
from
crying
.
*NL*
*NL*
Emil
started
up
and
then
sat
down
again
.
``
Alexandra
,
''
he
said
*NL*
slowly
,
in
his
deep
young
baritone
,
``
I
do
n't
want
to
go
away
to
*NL*
law
school
this
fall
.
Let
me
put
it
off
another
year
.
I
want
to
*NL*
take
a
year
off
and
look
around
.
It
's
awfully
easy
to
rush
into
*NL*
a
profession
you
do
n't
really
like
,
and
awfully
hard
to
get
out
of
*NL*
it
.
Linstrum
and
I
have
been
talking
about
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
Emil
.
Only
do
n't
go
off
looking
for
land
.
''
She
came
*NL*
up
and
put
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
.
``
I
've
been
wishing
you
could
*NL*
stay
with
me
this
winter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
just
what
I
do
n't
want
to
do
,
Alexandra
.
I
'm
restless

*NL*
I
want
to
go
to
a
new
place
.
I
want
to
go
down
to
the
City
of
*NL*
Mexico
to
join
one
of
the
University
fellows
who
's
at
the
head
of
*NL*
an
electrical
plant
.
He
wrote
me
he
could
give
me
a
little
job
,
*NL*
enough
to
pay
my
way
,
and
I
could
look
around
and
see
what
I
want
*NL*
to
do
.
I
want
to
go
as
soon
as
harvest
is
over
.
I
guess
Lou
and
*NL*
Oscar
will
be
sore
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
they
will
.
''
Alexandra
sat
down
on
the
lounge
beside
*NL*
him
.
``
They
are
very
angry
with
me
,
Emil
.
We
have
had
a
quarrel
.
*NL*
They
will
not
come
here
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Emil
scarcely
heard
what
she
was
saying
;
he
did
not
notice
the
*NL*
sadness
of
her
tone
.
He
was
thinking
about
the
reckless
life
he
*NL*
meant
to
live
in
Mexico
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
about
?
''
he
asked
absently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
About
Carl
Linstrum
.
They
are
afraid
I
am
going
to
marry
him
,
*NL*
and
that
some
of
my
property
will
get
away
from
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Emil
shrugged
his
shoulders
.
``
What
nonsense
!
''
he
murmured
.
``
Just
*NL*
like
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alexandra
drew
back
.
``
Why
nonsense
,
Emil
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
you
've
never
thought
of
such
a
thing
,
have
you
?
They
always
*NL*
have
to
have
something
to
fuss
about
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Emil
,
''
said
his
sister
slowly
,
``
you
ought
not
to
take
things
for
*NL*
granted
.
Do
you
agree
with
them
that
I
have
no
right
to
change
my
*NL*
way
of
living
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Emil
looked
at
the
outline
of
his
sister
's
head
in
the
dim
light
.
*NL*
They
were
sitting
close
together
and
he
somehow
felt
that
she
*NL*
could
hear
his
thoughts
.
He
was
silent
for
a
moment
,
and
then
said
*NL*
in
an
embarrassed
tone
,
``
Why
,
no
,
certainly
not
.
You
ought
to
do
*NL*
whatever
you
want
to
.
I
'll
always
back
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
would
seem
a
little
bit
ridiculous
to
you
if
I
married
*NL*
Carl
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Emil
fidgeted
.
The
issue
seemed
to
him
too
far-fetched
to
warrant
*NL*
discussion
.
``
Why
,
no
.
I
should
be
surprised
if
you
wanted
to
.
I
*NL*
ca
n't
see
exactly
why
.
But
that
's
none
of
my
business
.
You
ought
*NL*
to
do
as
you
please
.
Certainly
you
ought
not
to
pay
any
attention
*NL*
to
what
the
boys
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alexandra
sighed
.
``
I
had
hoped
you
might
understand
,
a
little
,
*NL*
why
I
do
want
to
.
But
I
suppose
that
's
too
much
to
expect
.
I
've
*NL*
had
a
pretty
lonely
life
,
Emil
.
Besides
Marie
,
Carl
is
the
only
*NL*
friend
I
have
ever
had
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Emil
was
awake
now
;
a
name
in
her
last
sentence
roused
him
.
He
*NL*
put
out
his
hand
and
took
his
sister
's
awkwardly
.
``
You
ought
to
*NL*
do
just
as
you
wish
,
and
I
think
Carl
's
a
fine
fellow
.
He
and
I
*NL*
would
always
get
on
.
I
do
n't
believe
any
of
the
things
the
boys
*NL*
say
about
him
,
honest
I
do
n't
.
They
are
suspicious
of
him
because
*NL*
he
's
intelligent
.
You
know
their
way
.
They
've
been
sore
at
me
*NL*
ever
since
you
let
me
go
away
to
college
.
They
're
always
trying
to
*NL*
catch
me
up
.
If
I
were
you
,
I
would
n't
pay
any
attention
to
them

*NL*
There
's
nothing
to
get
upset
about
.
Carl
's
a
sensible
fellow
.
He
*NL*
wo
n't
mind
them

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't

he
'll
go
away

''
*NL*
*NL*
Emil
grew
more
and
more
uneasy
.
``
Think
so
?
Well
,
Marie
said
it
*NL*
would
serve
us
all
right
if
you
walked
off
with
him

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
she

Bless
her
little
heart

SHE
would

''
Alexandra
's
voice
*NL*
broke
.
*NL*
*NL*
Emil
began
unlacing
his
leggings
.
``
Why
do
n't
you
talk
to
her
about
*NL*
it
?
There
's
Carl
,
I
hear
his
horse
.
I
guess
I
'll
go
upstairs
and
*NL*
get
my
boots
off
.
No
,
I
do
n't
want
any
supper
.
We
had
supper
at
*NL*
five
o'clock
,
at
the
fair
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Emil
was
glad
to
escape
and
get
to
his
own
room
.
He
was
a
little
*NL*
ashamed
for
his
sister
,
though
he
had
tried
not
to
show
it
.
He
*NL*
felt
that
there
was
something
indecorous
in
her
proposal
,
and
she
*NL*
did
seem
to
him
somewhat
ridiculous
.
There
was
trouble
enough
in
*NL*
the
world
,
he
reflected
,
as
he
threw
himself
upon
his
bed
,
without
*NL*
people
who
were
forty
years
old
imagining
they
wanted
to
get
*NL*
married
.
In
the
darkness
and
silence
Emil
was
not
likely
to
think
*NL*
long
about
Alexandra
.
Every
image
slipped
away
but
one
.
He
had
*NL*
seen
Marie
in
the
crowd
that
afternoon
.
She
sold
candy
at
the
*NL*
fair
.
WHY
had
she
ever
run
away
with
Frank
Shabata
,
and
how
could
*NL*
she
go
on
laughing
and
working
and
taking
an
interest
in
things
?
*NL*
Why
did
she
like
so
many
people
,
and
why
had
she
seemed
pleased
when
*NL*
all
the
French
and
Bohemian
boys
,
and
the
priest
himself
,
crowded
*NL*
round
her
candy
stand
?
Why
did
she
care
about
any
one
but
him
?
Why
*NL*
could
he
never
,
never
find
the
thing
he
looked
for
in
her
playful
,
*NL*
affectionate
eyes
?
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
fell
to
imagining
that
he
looked
once
more
and
found
it
*NL*
there
,
and
what
it
would
be
like
if
she
loved
him
,
--
she
who
,
as
*NL*
Alexandra
said
,
could
give
her
whole
heart
.
In
that
dream
he
could
*NL*
lie
for
hours
,
as
if
in
a
trance
.
His
spirit
went
out
of
his
body
*NL*
and
crossed
the
fields
to
Marie
Shabata
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
University
dances
the
girls
had
often
looked
wonderingly
*NL*
at
the
tall
young
Swede
with
the
fine
head
,
leaning
against
the
*NL*
wall
and
frowning
,
his
arms
folded
,
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
ceiling
*NL*
or
the
floor
.
All
the
girls
were
a
little
afraid
of
him
.
He
was
*NL*
distinguished-looking
,
and
not
the
jollying
kind
.
They
felt
that
*NL*
he
was
too
intense
and
preoccupied
.
There
was
something
queer
about
*NL*
him
.
Emil
's
fraternity
rather
prided
itself
upon
its
dances
,
and
*NL*
sometimes
he
did
his
duty
and
danced
every
dance
.
But
whether
he
*NL*
was
on
the
floor
or
brooding
in
a
corner
,
he
was
always
thinking
*NL*
about
Marie
Shabata
.
For
two
years
the
storm
had
been
gathering
*NL*
in
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
XII
*NL*
*NL*
Carl
came
into
the
sitting-room
while
Alexandra
was
lighting
the
*NL*
lamp
.
She
looked
up
at
him
as
she
adjusted
the
shade
.
His
sharp
*NL*
shoulders
stooped
as
if
he
were
very
tired
,
his
face
was
pale
,
*NL*
and
there
were
bluish
shadows
under
his
dark
eyes
.
His
anger
had
*NL*
burned
itself
out
and
left
him
sick
and
disgusted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
seen
Lou
and
Oscar
?
''
Alexandra
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
His
eyes
avoided
hers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alexandra
took
a
deep
breath
.
``
And
now
you
are
going
away
.
I
*NL*
thought
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carl
threw
himself
into
a
chair
and
pushed
the
dark
lock
back
*NL*
from
his
forehead
with
his
white
,
nervous
hand
.
``
What
a
hopeless
*NL*
position
you
are
in
,
Alexandra
!
''
he
exclaimed
feverishly
.
``
It
is
*NL*
your
fate
to
be
always
surrounded
by
little
men
.
And
I
am
no
better
*NL*
than
the
rest
.
I
am
too
little
to
face
the
criticism
of
even
such
*NL*
men
as
Lou
and
Oscar
.
Yes
,
I
am
going
away
;
to-morrow
.
I
can
not
*NL*
even
ask
you
to
give
me
a
promise
until
I
have
something
to
offer
*NL*
you
.
I
thought
,
perhaps
,
I
could
do
that
;
but
I
find
I
ca
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
good
comes
of
offering
people
things
they
do
n't
need
?
''
*NL*
Alexandra
asked
sadly
.
``
I
do
n't
need
money
.
But
I
have
needed
*NL*
you
for
a
great
many
years
.
I
wonder
why
I
have
been
permitted
to
*NL*
prosper
,
if
it
is
only
to
take
my
friends
away
from
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
deceive
myself
,
''
Carl
said
frankly
.
``
I
know
that
I
am
*NL*
going
away
on
my
own
account
.
I
must
make
the
usual
effort
.
I
*NL*
must
have
something
to
show
for
myself
.
To
take
what
you
would
*NL*
give
me
,
I
should
have
to
be
either
a
very
large
man
or
a
very
*NL*
small
one
,
and
I
am
only
in
the
middle
class
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alexandra
sighed
.
``
I
have
a
feeling
that
if
you
go
away
,
you
will
*NL*
not
come
back
.
Something
will
happen
to
one
of
us
,
or
to
both
.
*NL*
People
have
to
snatch
at
happiness
when
they
can
,
in
this
world
.
*NL*
It
is
always
easier
to
lose
than
to
find
.
What
I
have
is
yours
,
*NL*
if
you
care
enough
about
me
to
take
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carl
rose
and
looked
up
at
the
picture
of
John
Bergson
.
``
But
I
*NL*
ca
n't
,
my
dear
,
I
ca
n't
!
I
will
go
North
at
once
.
Instead
of
idling
*NL*
about
in
California
all
winter
,
I
shall
be
getting
my
bearings
up
*NL*
there
.
I
wo
n't
waste
another
week
.
Be
patient
with
me
,
Alexandra
.
*NL*
Give
me
a
year
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
you
will
,
''
said
Alexandra
wearily
.
``
All
at
once
,
in
a
single
*NL*
day
,
I
lose
everything
;
and
I
do
not
know
why
.
Emil
,
too
,
is
going
*NL*
away
.
''
Carl
was
still
studying
John
Bergson
's
face
and
Alexandra
's
*NL*
eyes
followed
his
.
``
Yes
,
''
she
said
,
``
if
he
could
have
seen
all
*NL*
that
would
come
of
the
task
he
gave
me
,
he
would
have
been
sorry
.
*NL*
I
hope
he
does
not
see
me
now
.
I
hope
that
he
is
among
the
old
*NL*
people
of
his
blood
and
country
,
and
that
tidings
do
not
reach
him
*NL*
from
the
New

PART
III
.
Winter
Memories
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
*NL*
*NL*
Winter
has
settled
down
over
the
Divide
again
;
the
season
in
*NL*
which
Nature
recuperates
,
in
which
she
sinks
to
sleep
between
the
*NL*
fruitfulness
of
autumn
and
the
passion
of
spring
.
The
birds
have
*NL*
gone
.
The
teeming
life
that
goes
on
down
in
the
long
grass
is
*NL*
exterminated
.
The
prairie-dog
keeps
his
hole
.
The
rabbits
run
*NL*
shivering
from
one
frozen
garden
patch
to
another
and
are
hard
put
*NL*
to
it
to
find
frost-bitten
cabbage-stalks
.
At
night
the
coyotes
*NL*
roam
the
wintry
waste
,
howling
for
food
.
The
variegated
fields
*NL*
are
all
one
color
now
;
the
pastures
,
the
stubble
,
the
roads
,
the
*NL*
sky
are
the
same
leaden
gray
.
The
hedgerows
and
trees
are
scarcely
*NL*
perceptible
against
the
bare
earth
,
whose
slaty
hue
they
have
taken
*NL*
on
.
The
ground
is
frozen
so
hard
that
it
bruises
the
foot
to
walk
*NL*
in
the
roads
or
in
the
ploughed
fields
.
It
is
like
an
iron
country
,
*NL*
and
the
spirit
is
oppressed
by
its
rigor
and
melancholy
.
One
could
*NL*
easily
believe
that
in
that
dead
landscape
the
germs
of
life
and
*NL*
fruitfulness
were
extinct
forever
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alexandra
has
settled
back
into
her
old
routine
.
There
are
weekly
*NL*
letters
from
Emil
.
Lou
and
Oscar
she
has
not
seen
since
Carl
*NL*
went
away
.
To
avoid
awkward
encounters
in
the
presence
of
curious
*NL*
spectators
,
she
has
stopped
going
to
the
Norwegian
Church
and
drives
*NL*
up
to
the
Reform
Church
at
Hanover
,
or
goes
with
Marie
Shabata
to
*NL*
the
Catholic
Church
,
locally
known
as
``
the
French
Church
.
''
She
has
*NL*
not
told
Marie
about
Carl
,
or
her
differences
with
her
brothers
.
*NL*
She
was
never
very
communicative
about
her
own
affairs
,
and
when
*NL*
she
came
to
the
point
,
an
instinct
told
her
that
about
such
things
*NL*
she
and
Marie
would
not
understand
one
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
Old
Mrs.
Lee
had
been
afraid
that
family
misunderstandings
might
*NL*
deprive
her
of
her
yearly
visit
to
Alexandra
.
But
on
the
first
day
*NL*
of
December
Alexandra
telephoned
Annie
that
to-morrow
she
would
*NL*
send
Ivar
over
for
her
mother
,
and
the
next
day
the
old
lady
arrived
*NL*
with
her
bundles
.
For
twelve
years
Mrs.
Lee
had
always
entered
*NL*
Alexandra
's
sitting-room
with
the
same
exclamation
,
``
Now
we
be
yust-a
*NL*
like
old
times
!
''
She
enjoyed
the
liberty
Alexandra
gave
her
,
and
*NL*
hearing
her
own
language
about
her
all
day
long
.
Here
she
could
*NL*
wear
her
nightcap
and
sleep
with
all
her
windows
shut
,
listen
*NL*
to
Ivar
reading
the
Bible
,
and
here
she
could
run
about
among
the
*NL*
stables
in
a
pair
of
Emil
's
old
boots
.
Though
she
was
bent
almost
*NL*
double
,
she
was
as
spry
as
a
gopher
.
Her
face
was
as
brown
as
if
*NL*
it
had
been
varnished
,
and
as
full
of
wrinkles
as
a
washerwoman
's
*NL*
hands
.
She
had
three
jolly
old
teeth
left
in
the
front
of
her
*NL*
mouth
,
and
when
she
grinned
she
looked
very
knowing
,
as
if
when
*NL*
you
found
out
how
to
take
it
,
life
was
n't
half
bad
.
While
she
and
*NL*
Alexandra
patched
and
pieced
and
quilted
,
she
talked
incessantly
*NL*
about
stories
she
read
in
a
Swedish
family
paper
,
telling
the
plots
*NL*
in
great
detail
;
or
about
her
life
on
a
dairy
farm
in
Gottland
*NL*
when
she
was
a
girl
.
Sometimes
she
forgot
which
were
the
printed
*NL*
stories
and
which
were
the
real
stories
,
it
all
seemed
so
far
away
.
*NL*
She
loved
to
take
a
little
brandy
,
with
hot
water
and
sugar
,
before
*NL*
she
went
to
bed
,
and
Alexandra
always
had
it
ready
for
her
.
``
It
*NL*
sends
good
dreams
,
''
she
would
say
with
a
twinkle
in
her
eye
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Mrs.
Lee
had
been
with
Alexandra
for
a
week
,
Marie
Shabata
*NL*
telephoned
one
morning
to
say
that
Frank
had
gone
to
town
for
the
*NL*
day
,
and
she
would
like
them
to
come
over
for
coffee
in
the
afternoon
.
*NL*
Mrs.
Lee
hurried
to
wash
out
and
iron
her
new
cross-stitched
apron
,
*NL*
which
she
had
finished
only
the
night
before
;
a
checked
gingham
*NL*
apron
worked
with
a
design
ten
inches
broad
across
the
bottom
;
*NL*
a
hunting
scene
,
with
fir
trees
and
a
stag
and
dogs
and
huntsmen
.
*NL*
Mrs.
Lee
was
firm
with
herself
at
dinner
,
and
refused
a
second
*NL*
helping
of
apple
dumplings
.
``
I
ta-ank
I
save
up
,
''
she
said
with
*NL*
a
giggle
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
two
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
Alexandra
's
cart
drove
up
to
the
*NL*
Shabatas
'
gate
,
and
Marie
saw
Mrs.
Lee
's
red
shawl
come
bobbing
up
*NL*
the
path
.
She
ran
to
the
door
and
pulled
the
old
woman
into
the
*NL*
house
with
a
hug
,
helping
her
to
take
off
her
wraps
while
Alexandra
*NL*
blanketed
the
horse
outside
.
Mrs.
Lee
had
put
on
her
best
black
*NL*
satine
dress
--
she
abominated
woolen
stuffs
,
even
in
winter
--
and
*NL*
a
crocheted
collar
,
fastened
with
a
big
pale
gold
pin
,
containing
*NL*
faded
daguerreotypes
of
her
father
and
mother
.
She
had
not
worn
*NL*
her
apron
for
fear
of
rumpling
it
,
and
now
she
shook
it
out
and
*NL*
tied
it
round
her
waist
with
a
conscious
air
.
Marie
drew
back
and
*NL*
threw
up
her
hands
,
exclaiming
,
``
Oh
,
what
a
beauty
!
I
've
never
*NL*
seen
this
one
before
,
have
I
,
Mrs.
Lee
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
woman
giggled
and
ducked
her
head
.
``
No
,
yust
las
'
night
I
*NL*
ma-ake
.
See
dis
tread
;
verra
strong
,
no
wa-ash
out
,
no
fade
.
My
*NL*
sister
send
from
Sveden
.
I
yust-a
ta-ank
you
like
dis
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marie
ran
to
the
door
again
.
``
Come
in
,
Alexandra
.
I
have
been
*NL*
looking
at
Mrs.
Lee
's
apron
.
Do
stop
on
your
way
home
and
show
it
*NL*
to
Mrs.
Hiller
.
She
's
crazy
about
cross-stitch
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
Alexandra
removed
her
hat
and
veil
,
Mrs.
Lee
went
out
to
the
*NL*
kitchen
and
settled
herself
in
a
wooden
rocking-chair
by
the
stove
,
*NL*
looking
with
great
interest
at
the
table
,
set
for
three
,
with
a
white
*NL*
cloth
,
and
a
pot
of
pink
geraniums
in
the
middle
.
``
My
,
a-an
'
t
you
*NL*
got
ta
fine
plants
;
such-a
much
flower
.
How
you
keep
from
freeze
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
pointed
to
the
window-shelves
,
full
of
blooming
fuchsias
and
*NL*
geraniums
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
keep
the
fire
all
night
,
Mrs.
Lee
,
and
when
it
's
very
cold
I
put
*NL*
them
all
on
the
table
,
in
the
middle
of
the
room
.
Other
nights
I
*NL*
only
put
newspapers
behind
them
.
Frank
laughs
at
me
for
fussing
,
*NL*
but
when
they
do
n't
bloom
he
says
,
`
What
's
the
matter
with
the
*NL*
darned
things
?
'
--
What
do
you
hear
from
Carl
,
Alexandra
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
got
to
Dawson
before
the
river
froze
,
and
now
I
suppose
I
wo
n't
*NL*
hear
any
more
until
spring
.
Before
he
left
California
he
sent
me
*NL*
a
box
of
orange
flowers
,
but
they
did
n't
keep
very
well
.
I
have
*NL*
brought
a
bunch
of
Emil
's
letters
for
you
.
''
Alexandra
came
out
*NL*
from
the
sitting-room
and
pinched
Marie
's
cheek
playfully
.
``
You
*NL*
do
n't
look
as
if
the
weather
ever
froze
you
up
.
Never
have
colds
,
*NL*
do
you
?
That
's
a
good
girl
.
She
had
dark
red
cheeks
like
this
*NL*
when
she
was
a
little
girl
,
Mrs.
Lee
.
She
looked
like
some
queer
*NL*
foreign
kind
of
a
doll
.
I
've
never
forgot
the
first
time
I
saw
*NL*
you
in
Mieklejohn
's
store
,
Marie
,
the
time
father
was
lying
sick
.
*NL*
Carl
and
I
were
talking
about
that
before
he
went
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
remember
,
and
Emil
had
his
kitten
along

When
are
you
going
to
*NL*
send
Emil
's
Christmas
box
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
ought
to
have
gone
before
this

I
'll
have
to
send
it
by
mail
*NL*
now
,
to
get
it
there
in
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marie
pulled
a
dark
purple
silk
necktie
from
her
workbasket
.
``
I
*NL*
knit
this
for
him
.
It
's
a
good
color
,
do
n't
you
think
?
Will
you
*NL*
please
put
it
in
with
your
things
and
tell
him
it
's
from
me
,
to
*NL*
wear
when
he
goes
serenading
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alexandra
laughed
.
``
I
do
n't
believe
he
goes
serenading
much
.
He
*NL*
says
in
one
letter
that
the
Mexican
ladies
are
said
to
be
very
*NL*
beautiful
,
but
that
do
n't
seem
to
me
very
warm
praise
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marie
tossed
her
head
.
``
Emil
ca
n't
fool
me
.
If
he
's
bought
a
*NL*
guitar
,
he
goes
serenading
.
Who
would
n't
,
with
all
those
Spanish
*NL*
girls
dropping
flowers
down
from
their
windows
!
I
'd
sing
to
them
*NL*
every
night
,
would
n't
you
,
Mrs.
Lee
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
lady
chuckled
.
Her
eyes
lit
up
as
Marie
bent
down
and
*NL*
opened
the
oven
door
.
A
delicious
hot
fragrance
blew
out
into
the
*NL*
tidy
kitchen
.
``
My
,
somet
`
ing
smell
good
!
''
She
turned
to
Alexandra
*NL*
with
a
wink
,
her
three
yellow
teeth
making
a
brave
show
,
``
I
ta-ank
*NL*
dat
stop
my
yaw
from
ache
no
more
!
''
she
said
contentedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marie
took
out
a
pan
of
delicate
little
rolls
,
stuffed
with
stewed
*NL*
apricots
,
and
began
to
dust
them
over
with
powdered
sugar
.
``
I
hope
*NL*
you
'll
like
these

Mrs.
Lee

Alexandra
does

The
Bohemians
always

them
with
their
coffee

But
if
you
do

I
have
a
coffee-cake
*NL*
with
nuts
and
poppy
seeds
.
Alexandra

will
you
get
the
cream
jug
?
*NL*
I
put
it
in
the
window
to
keep
cool

*NL*
``
The
Bohemians
,
''
said
Alexandra
,
as
they
drew
up
to
the
table
,
*NL*
``
certainly
know
how
to
make
more
kinds
of
bread
than
any
other
*NL*
people
in
the
world
.
Old
Mrs.
Hiller
told
me
once
at
the
church
*NL*
supper
that
she
could
make
seven
kinds
of
fancy
bread
,
but
Marie
*NL*
could
make
a
dozen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Lee
held
up
one
of
the
apricot
rolls
between
her
brown
thumb
*NL*
and
forefinger
and
weighed
it
critically
.
``
Yust
like-a
fedders
,
''
*NL*
she
pronounced
with
satisfaction
.
``
My
,
a-an

t
dis
nice
!
''
she
*NL*
exclaimed
as
she
stirred
her
coffee
.
``
I
yust
ta-ake
a
liddle
yelly
*NL*
now
,
too
,
I
ta-ank
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alexandra
and
Marie
laughed
at
her
forehandedness
,
and
fell
to
*NL*
talking
of
their
own
affairs
.
``
I
was
afraid
you
had
a
cold
when
*NL*
I
talked
to
you
over
the
telephone
the
other
night
,
Marie
.
What
*NL*
was
the
matter
,
had
you
been
crying
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Maybe
I
had
,
''
Marie
smiled
guiltily
.
``
Frank
was
out
late
that
*NL*
night
.
Do
n't
you
get
lonely
sometimes
in
the
winter
,
when
everybody
*NL*
has
gone
away
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
it
was
something
like
that
.
If
I
had
n't
had
company
,
*NL*
I
'd
have
run
over
to
see
for
myself
.
If
you
get
down-hearted
,
what
*NL*
will
become
of
the
rest
of
us
?
''
Alexandra
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
,
very
often
.
There
's
Mrs.
Lee
without
any
coffee
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Later
,
when
Mrs.
Lee
declared
that
her
powers
were
spent
,
Marie
*NL*
and
Alexandra
went
upstairs
to
look
for
some
crochet
patterns
the
*NL*
old
lady
wanted
to
borrow
.
``
Better
put
on
your
coat
,
Alexandra
.
*NL*
It
's
cold
up
there
,
and
I
have
no
idea
where
those
patterns
are
.
I
*NL*
may
have
to
look
through
my
old
trunks
.
''
Marie
caught
up
a
shawl
*NL*
and
opened
the
stair
door
,
running
up
the
steps
ahead
of
her
guest
.
*NL*
``
While
I
go
through
the
bureau
drawers
,
you
might
look
in
those
*NL*
hat-boxes
on
the
closet-shelf
,
over
where
Frank
's
clothes
hang
.
*NL*
There
are
a
lot
of
odds
and
ends
in
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
began
tossing
over
the
contents
of
the
drawers
,
and
Alexandra
*NL*
went
into
the
clothes-closet
.
Presently
she
came
back
,
holding
a
*NL*
slender
elastic
yellow
stick
in
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
in
the
world
is
this
,
Marie
?
You
do
n't
mean
to
tell
me
Frank
*NL*
ever
carried
such
a
thing
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marie
blinked
at
it
with
astonishment
and
sat
down
on
the
floor
.
*NL*
``
Where
did
you
find
it
?
I
did
n't
know
he
had
kept
it
.
I
have
n't
*NL*
seen
it
for
years
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
really
is
a
cane
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
One
he
brought
from
the
old
country
.
He
used
to
carry
it
*NL*
when
I
first
knew
him
.
Is
n't
it
foolish
?
Poor
Frank
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alexandra
twirled
the
stick
in
her
fingers
and
laughed
.
``
He
must
*NL*
have
looked
funny
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marie
was
thoughtful
.
``
No
,
he
did
n't
,
really
.
It
did
n't
seem
out
*NL*
of
place
.
He
used
to
be
awfully
gay
like
that
when
he
was
a
young
*NL*
man
.
I
guess
people
always
get
what
's
hardest
for
them
,
Alexandra
.
''
*NL*
Marie
gathered
the
shawl
closer
about
her
and
still
looked
hard
at
*NL*
the
cane
.
``
Frank
would
be
all
right
in
the
right
place
,
''
she
said
*NL*
reflectively
.
``
He
ought
to
have
a
different
kind
of
wife
,
for
one
*NL*
thing
.
Do
you
know
,
Alexandra
,
I
could
pick
out
exactly
the
right
*NL*
sort
of
woman
for
Frank
--
now
.
The
trouble
is
you
almost
have
*NL*
to
marry
a
man
before
you
can
find
out
the
sort
of
wife
he
needs
;
*NL*
and
usually
it
's
exactly
the
sort
you
are
not
.
Then
what
are
you
*NL*
going
to
do
about
it
?
''
she
asked
candidly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alexandra
confessed
she
did
n't
know
.
``
However
,
''
she
added
,
``
it
*NL*
seems
to
me
that
you
get
along
with
Frank
about
as
well
as
any
*NL*
woman
I
've
ever
seen
or
heard
of
could
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marie
shook
her
head
,
pursing
her
lips
and
blowing
her
warm
breath
*NL*
softly
out
into
the
frosty
air
.
``
No
;
I
was
spoiled
at
home
.
I
*NL*
like
my
own
way
,
and
I
have
a
quick
tongue
.
When
Frank
brags
,
I
*NL*
say
sharp
things
,
and
he
never
forgets
.
He
goes
over
and
over
it
*NL*
in
his
mind
;
I
can
feel
him
.
Then
I
'm
too
giddy
.
Frank
's
wife
*NL*
ought
to
be
timid
,
and
she
ought
not
to
care
about
another
living
*NL*
thing
in
the
world
but
just
Frank
!
I
did
n't
,
when
I
married
him
,
*NL*
but
I
suppose
I
was
too
young
to
stay
like
that
.
''
Marie
sighed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alexandra
had
never
heard
Marie
speak
so
frankly
about
her
husband
*NL*
before
,
and
she
felt
that
it
was
wiser
not
to
encourage
her
.
No
*NL*
good
,
she
reasoned
,
ever
came
from
talking
about
such
things
,
and
*NL*
while
Marie
was
thinking
aloud
,
Alexandra
had
been
steadily
searching
*NL*
the
hat-boxes
.
``
Are
n't
these
the
patterns
,
Maria
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maria
sprang
up
from
the
floor
.
``
Sure
enough
,
we
were
looking
*NL*
for
patterns
,
were
n't
we
?
I
'd
forgot
about
everything
but
Frank
's
*NL*
other
wife
.
I
'll
put
that
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
poked
the
cane
behind
Frank
's
Sunday
clothes
,
and
though
she
*NL*
laughed
,
Alexandra
saw
there
were
tears
in
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
went
back
to
the
kitchen
,
the
snow
had
begun
to
fall
,
*NL*
and
Marie
's
visitors
thought
they
must
be
getting
home
.
She
went
*NL*
out
to
the
cart
with
them
,
and
tucked
the
robes
about
old
Mrs.
*NL*
Lee
while
Alexandra
took
the
blanket
off
her
horse
.
As
they
drove
*NL*
away
,
Marie
turned
and
went
slowly
back
to
the
house
.
She
took
up
*NL*
the
package
of
letters
Alexandra
had
brought
,
but
she
did
not
read
*NL*
them
.
She
turned
them
over
and
looked
at
the
foreign
stamps
,
and
*NL*
then
sat
watching
the
flying
snow
while
the
dusk
deepened
in
the
*NL*
kitchen
and
the
stove
sent
out
a
red
glow
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marie
knew
perfectly
well
that
Emil
's
letters
were
written
more
for
*NL*
her
than
for
Alexandra
.
They
were
not
the
sort
of
letters
that
a
*NL*
young
man
writes
to
his
sister
.
They
were
both
more
personal
and
*NL*
more
painstaking
;
full
of
descriptions
of
the
gay
life
in
the
old
*NL*
Mexican
capital
in
the
days
when
the
strong
hand
of
Porfirio
Diaz
*NL*
was
still
strong
.
He
told
about
bull-fights
and
cock-fights
,
*NL*
churches
and
FIESTAS
,
the
flower-markets
and
the
fountains
,
the
*NL*
music
and
dancing
,
the
people
of
all
nations
he
met
in
the
Italian
*NL*
restaurants
on
San
Francisco
Street
.
In
short
,
they
were
the
kind
*NL*
of
letters
a
young
man
writes
to
a
woman
when
he
wishes
himself
*NL*
and
his
life
to
seem
interesting
to
her
,
when
he
wishes
to
enlist
*NL*
her
imagination
in
his
behalf
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marie
,
when
she
was
alone
or
when
she
sat
sewing
in
the
evening
,
*NL*
often
thought
about
what
it
must
be
like
down
there
where
Emil
was
;
*NL*
where
there
were
flowers
and
street
bands
everywhere
,
and
carriages
*NL*
rattling
up
and
down
,
and
where
there
was
a
little
blind
boot-black
*NL*
in
front
of
the
cathedral
who
could
play
any
tune
you
asked
for
*NL*
by
dropping
the
lids
of
blacking-boxes
on
the
stone
steps
.
When
*NL*
everything
is
done
and
over
for
one
at
twenty-three
,
it
is
pleasant
*NL*
to
let
the
mind
wander
forth
and
follow
a
young
adventurer
who
has
*NL*
life
before
him
.
``
And
if
it
had
not
been
for
me
,
''
she
thought
,
*NL*
``
Frank
might
still
be
free
like
that
,
and
having
a
good
time
making
*NL*
people
admire
him
.
Poor
Frank
,
getting
married
was
n't
very
good
*NL*
for
him
either
.
I
'm
afraid
I
do
set
people
against
him
,
as
he
says
.
*NL*
I
seem
,
somehow
,
to
give
him
away
all
the
time
.
Perhaps
he
would
*NL*
try
to
be
agreeable
to
people
again
,
if
I
were
not
around
.
It
*NL*
seems
as
if
I
always
make
him
just
as
bad
as
he
can
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Later
in
the
winter
,
Alexandra
looked
back
upon
that
afternoon
as
*NL*
the
last
satisfactory
visit
she
had
had
with
Marie
.
After
that
*NL*
day
the
younger
woman
seemed
to
shrink
more
and
more
into
herself
.
*NL*
When
she
was
with
Alexandra
she
was
not
spontaneous
and
frank
*NL*
as
she
used
to
be
.
She
seemed
to
be
brooding
over
something
,
and
*NL*
holding
something
back
.
The
weather
had
a
good
deal
to
do
with
*NL*
their
seeing
less
of
each
other
than
usual
.
There
had
not
been
*NL*
such
snowstorms
in
twenty
years
,
and
the
path
across
the
fields
was
*NL*
drifted
deep
from
Christmas
until
March
.
When
the
two
neighbors
*NL*
went
to
see
each
other
,
they
had
to
go
round
by
the
wagon-road
,
*NL*
which
was
twice
as
far
.
They
telephoned
each
other
almost
every
*NL*
night
,
though
in
January
there
was
a
stretch
of
three
weeks
when
*NL*
the
wires
were
down
,
and
when
the
postman
did
not
come
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marie
often
ran
in
to
see
her
nearest
neighbor
,
old
Mrs.
Hiller
,
*NL*
who
was
crippled
with
rheumatism
and
had
only
her
son
,
the
lame
*NL*
shoemaker
,
to
take
care
of
her
;
and
she
went
to
the
French
Church
,
*NL*
whatever
the
weather
.
She
was
a
sincerely
devout
girl
.
She
prayed
*NL*
for
herself
and
for
Frank
,
and
for
Emil
,
among
the
temptations
of
*NL*
that
gay
,
corrupt
old
city
.
She
found
more
comfort
in
the
Church
*NL*
that
winter
than
ever
before
.
It
seemed
to
come
closer
to
her
,
*NL*
and
to
fill
an
emptiness
that
ached
in
her
heart
.
She
tried
to
*NL*
be
patient
with
her
husband
.
He
and
his
hired
man
usually
played
*NL*
California
Jack
in
the
evening
.
Marie
sat
sewing
or
crocheting
and
*NL*
tried
to
take
a
friendly
interest
in
the
game
,
but
she
was
always
*NL*
thinking
about
the
wide
fields
outside
,
where
the
snow
was
drifting
*NL*
over
the
fences
;
and
about
the
orchard
,
where
the
snow
was
falling
*NL*
and
packing
,
crust
over
crust
.
When
she
went
out
into
the
dark
*NL*
kitchen
to
fix
her
plants
for
the
night
,
she
used
to
stand
by
the
*NL*
window
and
look
out
at
the
white
fields
,
or
watch
the
currents
of
*NL*
snow
whirling
over
the
orchard
.
She
seemed
to
feel
the
weight
of
*NL*
all
the
snow
that
lay
down
there
.
The
branches
had
become
so
hard
*NL*
that
they
wounded
your
hand
if
you
but
tried
to
break
a
twig
.
And
*NL*
yet
,
down
under
the
frozen
crusts
,
at
the
roots
of
the
trees
,
the
*NL*
secret
of
life
was
still
safe
,
warm
as
the
blood
in
one
's
heart
;
*NL*
and
the
spring
would
come
again
!
Oh
,
it
would
come
again
!
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
II
*NL*
*NL*
If
Alexandra
had
had
much
imagination
she
might
have
guessed
what
*NL*
was
going
on
in
Marie
's
mind
,
and
she
would
have
seen
long
before
*NL*
what
was
going
on
in
Emil
's
.
But
that
,
as
Emil
himself
had
more
*NL*
than
once
reflected
,
was
Alexandra
's
blind
side
,
and
her
life
had
*NL*
not
been
of
the
kind
to
sharpen
her
vision
.
Her
training
had
all
*NL*
been
toward
the
end
of
making
her
proficient
in
what
she
had
undertaken
*NL*
to
do
.
Her
personal
life
,
her
own
realization
of
herself
,
was
*NL*
almost
a
subconscious
existence
;
like
an
underground
river
that
*NL*
came
to
the
surface
only
here
and
there
,
at
intervals
months
apart
,
*NL*
and
then
sank
again
to
flow
on
under
her
own
fields
.
Nevertheless
,
*NL*
the
underground
stream
was
there
,
and
it
was
because
she
had
so
much
*NL*
personality
to
put
into
her
enterprises
and
succeeded
in
putting
*NL*
it
into
them
so
completely
,
that
her
affairs
prospered
better
than
*NL*
those
of
her
neighbors
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
certain
days
in
her
life
,
outwardly
uneventful
,
which
*NL*
Alexandra
remembered
as
peculiarly
happy
;
days
when
she
was
close
*NL*
to
the
flat
,
fallow
world
about
her
,
and
felt
,
as
it
were
,
in
her
*NL*
own
body
the
joyous
germination
in
the
soil
.
There
were
days
,
*NL*
too
,
which
she
and
Emil
had
spent
together
,
upon
which
she
loved
*NL*
to
look
back
.
There
had
been
such
a
day
when
they
were
down
on
*NL*
the
river
in
the
dry
year
,
looking
over
the
land
.
They
had
made
*NL*
an
early
start
one
morning
and
had
driven
a
long
way
before
noon
.
*NL*
When
Emil
said
he
was
hungry
,
they
drew
back
from
the
road
,
gave
*NL*
Brigham
his
oats
among
the
bushes
,
and
climbed
up
to
the
top
of
a
*NL*
grassy
bluff
to
eat
their
lunch
under
the
shade
of
some
little
elm
*NL*
trees
.
The
river
was
clear
there
,
and
shallow
,
since
there
had
*NL*
been
no
rain
,
and
it
ran
in
ripples
over
the
sparkling
sand
.
Under
*NL*
the
overhanging
willows
of
the
opposite
bank
there
was
an
inlet
where
*NL*
the
water
was
deeper
and
flowed
so
slowly
that
it
seemed
to
sleep
*NL*
in
the
sun
.
In
this
little
bay
a
single
wild
duck
was
swimming
and
*NL*
diving
and
preening
her
feathers
,
disporting
herself
very
happily
*NL*
in
the
flickering
light
and
shade
.
They
sat
for
a
long
time
,
*NL*
watching
the
solitary
bird
take
its
pleasure
.
No
living
thing
*NL*
had
ever
seemed
to
Alexandra
as
beautiful
as
that
wild
duck
.
Emil
*NL*
must
have
felt
about
it
as
she
did
,
for
afterward
,
when
they
were
*NL*
at
home
,
he
used
sometimes
to
say
,
``
Sister
,
you
know
our
duck
down
*NL*
there
--
''
Alexandra
remembered
that
day
as
one
of
the
happiest
in
*NL*
her
life
.
Years
afterward
she
thought
of
the
duck
as
still
there
,
*NL*
swimming
and
diving
all
by
herself
in
the
sunlight
,
a
kind
of
*NL*
enchanted
bird
that
did
not
know
age
or
change
.
*NL*
*NL*
Most
of
Alexandra
's
happy
memories
were
as
impersonal
as
this
one
;
*NL*
yet
to
her
they
were
very
personal
.
Her
mind
was
a
white
book
,
*NL*
with
clear
writing
about
weather
and
beasts
and
growing
things
.
*NL*
Not
many
people
would
have
cared
to
read
it
;
only
a
happy
few
.
*NL*
She
had
never
been
in
love
,
she
had
never
indulged
in
sentimental
*NL*
reveries
.
Even
as
a
girl
she
had
looked
upon
men
as
work-fellows
.
*NL*
She
had
grown
up
in
serious
times
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
one
fancy
indeed
,
which
persisted
through
her
girlhood
.
*NL*
It
most
often
came
to
her
on
Sunday
mornings
,
the
one
day
in
*NL*
the
week
when
she
lay
late
abed
listening
to
the
familiar
morning
*NL*
sounds
;
the
windmill
singing
in
the
brisk
breeze
,
Emil
whistling
*NL*
as
he
blacked
his
boots
down
by
the
kitchen
door
.
Sometimes
,
as
*NL*
she
lay
thus
luxuriously
idle
,
her
eyes
closed
,
she
used
to
have
*NL*
an
illusion
of
being
lifted
up
bodily
and
carried
lightly
by
some
*NL*
one
very
strong
.
It
was
a
man
,
certainly
,
who
carried
her
,
but
*NL*
he
was
like
no
man
she
knew
;
he
was
much
larger
and
stronger
and
*NL*
swifter
,
and
he
carried
her
as
easily
as
if
she
were
a
sheaf
of
*NL*
wheat
.
She
never
saw
him
,
but
,
with
eyes
closed
,
she
could
feel
*NL*
that
he
was
yellow
like
the
sunlight
,
and
there
was
the
smell
of
*NL*
ripe
cornfields
about
him
.
She
could
feel
him
approach
,
bend
over
*NL*
her
and
lift
her
,
and
then
she
could
feel
herself
being
carried
*NL*
swiftly
off
across
the
fields
.
After
such
a
reverie
she
would
rise
*NL*
hastily
,
angry
with
herself
,
and
go
down
to
the
bath-house
that
*NL*
was
partitioned
off
the
kitchen
shed
.
There
she
would
stand
in
a
*NL*
tin
tub
and
prosecute
her
bath
with
vigor
,
finishing
it
by
pouring
*NL*
buckets
of
cold
well-water
over
her
gleaming
white
body
which
no
*NL*
man
on
the
Divide
could
have
carried
very
far
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
grew
older
,
this
fancy
more
often
came
to
her
when
she
was
*NL*
tired
than
when
she
was
fresh
and
strong
.
Sometimes
,
after
she
had
*NL*
been
in
the
open
all
day
,
overseeing
the
branding
of
the
cattle
or
*NL*
the
loading
of
the
pigs
,
she
would
come
in
chilled
,
take
a
concoction
*NL*
of
spices
and
warm
home-made
wine
,
and
go
to
bed
with
her
body
*NL*
actually
aching
with
fatigue
.
Then
,
just
before
she
went
to
sleep
,
*NL*
she
had
the
old
sensation
of
being
lifted
and
carried
by
a
strong
*NL*
being
who
took
from
her
all
her
bodily
weariness
.

PART
IV
.
The
White
Mulberry
Tree
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
*NL*
*NL*
The
French
Church
,
properly
the
Church
of
Sainte-Agnes
,
stood
*NL*
upon
a
hill
.
The
high
,
narrow
,
red-brick
building
,
with
its
tall
*NL*
steeple
and
steep
roof
,
could
be
seen
for
miles
across
the
wheatfields
,
*NL*
though
the
little
town
of
Sainte-Agnes
was
completely
hidden
away
*NL*
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
.
The
church
looked
powerful
and
triumphant
*NL*
there
on
its
eminence
,
so
high
above
the
rest
of
the
landscape
,
*NL*
with
miles
of
warm
color
lying
at
its
feet
,
and
by
its
position
and
*NL*
setting
it
reminded
one
of
some
of
the
churches
built
long
ago
in
*NL*
the
wheat-lands
of
middle
France
.
*NL*
*NL*
Late
one
June
afternoon
Alexandra
Bergson
was
driving
along
one
*NL*
of
the
many
roads
that
led
through
the
rich
French
farming
country
*NL*
to
the
big
church
.
The
sunlight
was
shining
directly
in
her
face
,
*NL*
and
there
was
a
blaze
of
light
all
about
the
red
church
on
the
*NL*
hill
.
Beside
Alexandra
lounged
a
strikingly
exotic
figure
in
a
*NL*
tall
Mexican
hat
,
a
silk
sash
,
and
a
black
velvet
jacket
sewn
with
*NL*
silver
buttons
.
Emil
had
returned
only
the
night
before
,
and
his
*NL*
sister
was
so
proud
of
him
that
she
decided
at
once
to
take
him
up
*NL*
to
the
church
supper
,
and
to
make
him
wear
the
Mexican
costume
he
*NL*
had
brought
home
in
his
trunk
.
``
All
the
girls
who
have
stands
are
*NL*
going
to
wear
fancy
costumes
,
''
she
argued
,
``
and
some
of
the
boys
.
*NL*
Marie
is
going
to
tell
fortunes
,
and
she
sent
to
Omaha
for
a
Bohemian
*NL*
dress
her
father
brought
back
from
a
visit
to
the
old
country
.
*NL*
If
you
wear
those
clothes
,
they
will
all
be
pleased
.
And
you
must
*NL*
take
your
guitar
.
Everybody
ought
to
do
what
they
can
to
help
*NL*
along
,
and
we
have
never
done
much
.
We
are
not
a
talented
family
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
supper
was
to
be
at
six
o'clock
,
in
the
basement
of
the
church
,
*NL*
and
afterward
there
would
be
a
fair
,
with
charades
and
an
auction
.
*NL*
Alexandra
had
set
out
from
home
early
,
leaving
the
house
to
Signa
*NL*
and
Nelse
Jensen
,
who
were
to
be
married
next
week
.
Signa
had
*NL*
shyly
asked
to
have
the
wedding
put
off
until
Emil
came
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alexandra
was
well
satisfied
with
her
brother
.
As
they
drove
*NL*
through
the
rolling
French
country
toward
the
westering
sun
and
the
*NL*
stalwart
church
,
she
was
thinking
of
that
time
long
ago
when
she
*NL*
and
Emil
drove
back
from
the
river
valley
to
the
still
unconquered
*NL*
Divide
.
Yes
,
she
told
herself
,
it
had
been
worth
while
;
both
Emil
*NL*
and
the
country
had
become
what
she
had
hoped
.
Out
of
her
father
's
*NL*
children
there
was
one
who
was
fit
to
cope
with
the
world
,
who
had
*NL*
not
been
tied
to
the
plow
,
and
who
had
a
personality
apart
from
the
*NL*
soil
.
And
that
,
she
reflected
,
was
what
she
had
worked
for
.
She
*NL*
felt
well
satisfied
with
her
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
reached
the
church
,
a
score
of
teams
were
hitched
in
*NL*
front
of
the
basement
doors
that
opened
from
the
hillside
upon
the
*NL*
sanded
terrace
,
where
the
boys
wrestled
and
had
jumping-matches
.
*NL*
Amedee
Chevalier
,
a
proud
father
of
one
week
,
rushed
out
and
*NL*
embraced
Emil
.
Amedee
was
an
only
son
,
--
hence
he
was
a
very
rich
*NL*
young
man
,
--
but
he
meant
to
have
twenty
children
himself
,
like
*NL*
his
uncle
Xavier
.
``
Oh
,
Emil
,
''
he
cried
,
hugging
his
old
friend
*NL*
rapturously
,
``
why
ai
n't
you
been
up
to
see
my
boy
?
You
come
*NL*
to-morrow
,
sure
?
Emil
,
you
wan
na
get
a
boy
right
off
!
It
's
the
*NL*
greatest
thing
ever
!
No
,
no
,
no
!
Angel
not
sick
at
all
.
Everything
*NL*
just
fine
.
That
boy
he
come
into
this
world
laughin
'
,
and
he
been
*NL*
laughin
'
ever
since
.
You
come
an
'
see
!
''
He
pounded
Emil
's
ribs
*NL*
to
emphasize
each
announcement
.
*NL*
*NL*
Emil
caught
his
arms
.
``
Stop
,
Amedee
.
You
're
knocking
the
wind
out
*NL*
of
me
.
I
brought
him
cups
and
spoons
and
blankets
and
moccasins
*NL*
enough
for
an
orphan
asylum
.
I
'm
awful
glad
it
's
a
boy
,
sure
*NL*
enough
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
men
crowded
round
Emil
to
admire
his
costume
and
to
tell
*NL*
him
in
a
breath
everything
that
had
happened
since
he
went
away
.
*NL*
Emil
had
more
friends
up
here
in
the
French
country
than
down
on
*NL*
Norway
Creek
.
The
French
and
Bohemian
boys
were
spirited
and
jolly
,
*NL*
liked
variety
,
and
were
as
much
predisposed
to
favor
anything
new
*NL*
as
the
Scandinavian
boys
were
to
reject
it
.
The
Norwegian
and
*NL*
Swedish
lads
were
much
more
self-centred
,
apt
to
be
egotistical
*NL*
and
jealous
.
They
were
cautious
and
reserved
with
Emil
because
he
*NL*
had
been
away
to
college
,
and
were
prepared
to
take
him
down
if
he
*NL*
should
try
to
put
on
airs
with
them
.
The
French
boys
liked
a
bit
*NL*
of
swagger
,
and
they
were
always
delighted
to
hear
about
anything
*NL*
new
:
new
clothes
,
new
games
,
new
songs
,
new
dances
.
Now
they
*NL*
carried
Emil
off
to
show
him
the
club
room
they
had
just
fitted
up
*NL*
over
the
post-office
,
down
in
the
village
.
They
ran
down
the
hill
*NL*
in
a
drove
,
all
laughing
and
chattering
at
once
,
some
in
French
,
*NL*
some
in
English
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alexandra
went
into
the
cool
,
whitewashed
basement
where
the
women
*NL*
were
setting
the
tables
.
Marie
was
standing
on
a
chair
,
building
*NL*
a
little
tent
of
shawls
where
she
was
to
tell
fortunes
.
She
sprang
*NL*
down
and
ran
toward
Alexandra
,
stopping
short
and
looking
at
her
*NL*
in
disappointment
.
Alexandra
nodded
to
her
encouragingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
he
will
be
here
,
Marie
.
The
boys
have
taken
him
off
to
show
*NL*
him
something
.
You
wo
n't
know
him
.
He
is
a
man
now
,
sure
enough
.
*NL*
I
have
no
boy
left
.
He
smokes
terrible-smelling
Mexican
cigarettes
*NL*
and
talks
Spanish
.
How
pretty
you
look
,
child
.
Where
did
you
get
*NL*
those
beautiful
earrings
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
belonged
to
father
's
mother
.
He
always
promised
them
to
me
.
*NL*
He
sent
them
with
the
dress
and
said
I
could
keep
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marie
wore
a
short
red
skirt
of
stoutly
woven
cloth
,
a
white
bodice
*NL*
and
kirtle
,
a
yellow
silk
turban
wound
low
over
her
brown
curls
,
*NL*
and
long
coral
pendants
in
her
ears
.
Her
ears
had
been
pierced
*NL*
against
a
piece
of
cork
by
her
great-aunt
when
she
was
seven
years
*NL*
old
.
In
those
germless
days
she
had
worn
bits
of
broom-straw
,
plucked
*NL*
from
the
common
sweeping-broom
,
in
the
lobes
until
the
holes
were
*NL*
healed
and
ready
for
little
gold
rings
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Emil
came
back
from
the
village
,
he
lingered
outside
on
the
*NL*
terrace
with
the
boys
.
Marie
could
hear
him
talking
and
strumming
*NL*
on
his
guitar
while
Raoul
Marcel
sang
falsetto
.
She
was
vexed
*NL*
with
him
for
staying
out
there
.
It
made
her
very
nervous
to
hear
*NL*
him
and
not
to
see
him
;
for
,
certainly
,
she
told
herself
,
she
was
*NL*
not
going
out
to
look
for
him
.
When
the
supper
bell
rang
and
the
*NL*
boys
came
trooping
in
to
get
seats
at
the
first
table
,
she
forgot
*NL*
all
about
her
annoyance
and
ran
to
greet
the
tallest
of
the
crowd
,
*NL*
in
his
conspicuous
attire
.
She
did
n't
mind
showing
her
embarrassment
*NL*
at
all
.
She
blushed
and
laughed
excitedly
as
she
gave
Emil
her
*NL*
hand
,
and
looked
delightedly
at
the
black
velvet
coat
that
brought
*NL*
out
his
fair
skin
and
fine
blond
head
.
Marie
was
incapable
of
being
*NL*
lukewarm
about
anything
that
pleased
her
.
She
simply
did
not
know
*NL*
how
to
give
a
half-hearted
response
.
When
she
was
delighted
,
she
*NL*
was
as
likely
as
not
to
stand
on
her
tip-toes
and
clap
her
hands
.
*NL*
If
people
laughed
at
her
,
she
laughed
with
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
the
men
wear
clothes
like
that
every
day
,
in
the
street
?
''
She
*NL*
caught
Emil
by
his
sleeve
and
turned
him
about
.
``
Oh
,
I
wish
I
lived
*NL*
where
people
wore
things
like
that
!
Are
the
buttons
real
silver
?
*NL*
Put
on
the
hat
,
please
.
What
a
heavy
thing
!
How
do
you
ever
wear
*NL*
it
?
Why
do
n't
you
tell
us
about
the
bull-fights
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
wanted
to
wring
all
his
experiences
from
him
at
once
,
without
*NL*
waiting
a
moment
.
Emil
smiled
tolerantly
and
stood
looking
down
at
*NL*
her
with
his
old
,
brooding
gaze
,
while
the
French
girls
fluttered
*NL*
about
him
in
their
white
dresses
and
ribbons
,
and
Alexandra
watched
*NL*
the
scene
with
pride
.
Several
of
the
French
girls
,
Marie
knew
,
were
*NL*
hoping
that
Emil
would
take
them
to
supper
,
and
she
was
relieved
*NL*
when
he
took
only
his
sister
.
Marie
caught
Frank
's
arm
and
dragged
*NL*
him
to
the
same
table
,
managing
to
get
seats
opposite
the
Bergsons
,
*NL*
so
that
she
could
hear
what
they
were
talking
about
.
Alexandra
*NL*
made
Emil
tell
Mrs.
Xavier
Chevalier
,
the
mother
of
the
twenty
,
*NL*
about
how
he
had
seen
a
famous
matador
killed
in
the
bull-ring
.
*NL*
Marie
listened
to
every
word
,
only
taking
her
eyes
from
Emil
to
*NL*
watch
Frank
's
plate
and
keep
it
filled
.
When
Emil
finished
his
*NL*
account
,
--
bloody
enough
to
satisfy
Mrs.
Xavier
and
to
make
her
*NL*
feel
thankful
that
she
was
not
a
matador
,
--
Marie
broke
out
with
*NL*
a
volley
of
questions
.
How
did
the
women
dress
when
they
went
to
*NL*
bull-fights
?
Did
they
wear
mantillas
?
Did
they
never

After
supper
the
young
people
played
charades
for
the
amusement
*NL*
of
their
elders
,
who
sat
gossiping
between
their
guesses
.
All
the
*NL*
shops
in
Sainte-Agnes
were
closed
at
eight
o'clock
that
night
,
so
*NL*
that
the
merchants
and
their
clerks
could
attend
the
fair
.
The
*NL*
auction
was
the
liveliest
part
of
the
entertainment
,
for
the
French
*NL*
boys
always
lost
their
heads
when
they
began
to
bid
,
satisfied
that
*NL*
their
extravagance
was
in
a
good
cause
.
After
all
the
pincushions
*NL*
and
sofa
pillows
and
embroidered
slippers
were
sold
,
Emil
precipitated
*NL*
a
panic
by
taking
out
one
of
his
turquoise
shirt
studs
,
which
every
*NL*
one
had
been
admiring
,
and
handing
it
to
the
auctioneer
.
All
the
*NL*
French
girls
clamored
for
it
,
and
their
sweethearts
bid
against
*NL*
each
other
recklessly
.
Marie
wanted
it
,
too
,
and
she
kept
making
*NL*
signals
to
Frank
,
which
he
took
a
sour
pleasure
in
disregarding
.
*NL*
He
did
n't
see
the
use
of
making
a
fuss
over
a
fellow
just
because
*NL*
he
was
dressed
like
a
clown
.
When
the
turquoise
went
to
Malvina
*NL*
Sauvage
,
the
French
banker
's
daughter
,
Marie
shrugged
her
shoulders
*NL*
and
betook
herself
to
her
little
tent
of
shawls
,
where
she
began
*NL*
to
shuffle
her
cards
by
the
light
of
a
tallow
candle
,
calling
out
,
*NL*
``
Fortunes
,
fortunes
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
priest
,
Father
Duchesne
,
went
first
to
have
his
fortune
*NL*
read
.
Marie
took
his
long
white
hand
,
looked
at
it
,
and
then
*NL*
began
to
run
off
her
cards
.
``
I
see
a
long
journey
across
water
for
*NL*
you
,
Father
.
You
will
go
to
a
town
all
cut
up
by
water
;
built
on
*NL*
islands
,
it
seems
to
be
,
with
rivers
and
green
fields
all
about
.
*NL*
And
you
will
visit
an
old
lady
with
a
white
cap
and
gold
hoops
in
*NL*
her
ears
,
and
you
will
be
very
happy
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mais
,
oui
,
''
said
the
priest
,
with
a
melancholy
smile
.
``
C'est
*NL*
L'Isle-Adam
,
chez
ma
mere
.
Vous
etes
tres
savante
,
ma
fille
.
''
He
*NL*
patted
her
yellow
turban
,
calling
,
``
Venez
donc
,
mes
garcons
!
Il
*NL*
y
a
ici
une
veritable
clairvoyante
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marie
was
clever
at
fortune-telling
,
indulging
in
a
light
irony
*NL*
that
amused
the
crowd
.
She
told
old
Brunot
,
the
miser
,
that
he
*NL*
would
lose
all
his
money
,
marry
a
girl
of
sixteen
,
and
live
happily
*NL*
on
a
crust
.
Sholte
,
the
fat
Russian
boy
,
who
lived
for
his
stomach
,
*NL*
was
to
be
disappointed
in
love
,
grow
thin
,
and
shoot
himself
from
*NL*
despondency
.
Amedee
was
to
have
twenty
children
,
and
nineteen
of
*NL*
them
were
to
be
girls
.
Amedee
slapped
Frank
on
the
back
and
asked
*NL*
him
why
he
did
n't
see
what
the
fortune-teller
would
promise
him
.
*NL*
But
Frank
shook
off
his
friendly
hand
and
grunted
,
``
She
tell
my
*NL*
fortune
long
ago
;
bad
enough
!
''
Then
he
withdrew
to
a
corner
and
*NL*
sat
glowering
at
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
Frank
's
case
was
all
the
more
painful
because
he
had
no
one
*NL*
in
particular
to
fix
his
jealousy
upon
.
Sometimes
he
could
have
*NL*
thanked
the
man
who
would
bring
him
evidence
against
his
wife
.
*NL*
He
had
discharged
a
good
farm-boy
,
Jan
Smirka
,
because
he
thought
*NL*
Marie
was
fond
of
him
;
but
she
had
not
seemed
to
miss
Jan
when
*NL*
he
was
gone
,
and
she
had
been
just
as
kind
to
the
next
boy
.
The
*NL*
farm-hands
would
always
do
anything
for
Marie
;
Frank
could
n't
find
*NL*
one
so
surly
that
he
would
not
make
an
effort
to
please
her
.
At
*NL*
the
bottom
of
his
heart
Frank
knew
well
enough
that
if
he
could
once
*NL*
give
up
his
grudge
,
his
wife
would
come
back
to
him
.
But
he
could
*NL*
never
in
the
world
do
that
.
The
grudge
was
fundamental
.
Perhaps
*NL*
he
could
not
have
given
it
up
if
he
had
tried
.
Perhaps
he
got
more
*NL*
satisfaction
out
of
feeling
himself
abused
than
he
would
have
got
*NL*
out
of
being
loved
.
If
he
could
once
have
made
Marie
thoroughly
*NL*
unhappy
,
he
might
have
relented
and
raised
her
from
the
dust
.
But
*NL*
she
had
never
humbled
herself
.
In
the
first
days
of
their
love
*NL*
she
had
been
his
slave
;
she
had
admired
him
abandonedly
.
But
the
*NL*
moment
he
began
to
bully
her
and
to
be
unjust
,
she
began
to
draw
*NL*
away
;
at
first
in
tearful
amazement
,
then
in
quiet
,
unspoken
disgust
.
*NL*
The
distance
between
them
had
widened
and
hardened
.
It
no
longer
*NL*
contracted
and
brought
them
suddenly
together
.
The
spark
of
her
*NL*
life
went
somewhere
else
,
and
he
was
always
watching
to
surprise
*NL*
it
.
He
knew
that
somewhere
she
must
get
a
feeling
to
live
upon
,
*NL*
for
she
was
not
a
woman
who
could
live
without
loving
.
He
wanted
*NL*
to
prove
to
himself
the
wrong
he
felt
.
What
did
she
hide
in
her
*NL*
heart
?
Where
did
it
go
?
Even
Frank
had
his
churlish
delicacies
;
*NL*
he
never
reminded
her
of
how
much
she
had
once
loved
him
.
For
that
*NL*
Marie
was
grateful
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
Marie
was
chattering
to
the
French
boys
,
Amedee
called
Emil
*NL*
to
the
back
of
the
room
and
whispered
to
him
that
they
were
going
*NL*
to
play
a
joke
on
the
girls
.
At
eleven
o'clock
,
Amedee
was
to
go
*NL*
up
to
the
switchboard
in
the
vestibule
and
turn
off
the
electric
*NL*
lights
,
and
every
boy
would
have
a
chance
to
kiss
his
sweetheart
*NL*
before
Father
Duchesne
could
find
his
way
up
the
stairs
to
turn
the
*NL*
current
on
again
.
The
only
difficulty
was
the
candle
in
Marie
's
*NL*
tent
;
perhaps
,
as
Emil
had
no
sweetheart
,
he
would
oblige
the
boys
*NL*
by
blowing
out
the
candle
.
Emil
said
he
would
undertake
to
do
*NL*
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
five
minutes
to
eleven
he
sauntered
up
to
Marie
's
booth
,
and
*NL*
the
French
boys
dispersed
to
find
their
girls
.
He
leaned
over
the
*NL*
card-table
and
gave
himself
up
to
looking
at
her
.
``
Do
you
think
*NL*
you
could
tell
my
fortune
?
''
he
murmured
.
It
was
the
first
word
he
*NL*
had
had
alone
with
her
for
almost
a
year
.
``
My
luck
has
n't
changed
*NL*
any
.
It
's
just
the
same
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marie
had
often
wondered
whether
there
was
anyone
else
who
could
*NL*
look
his
thoughts
to
you
as
Emil
could
.
To-night
,
when
she
met
his
*NL*
steady
,
powerful
eyes
,
it
was
impossible
not
to
feel
the
sweetness
*NL*
of
the
dream
he
was
dreaming
;
it
reached
her
before
she
could
shut
*NL*
it
out
,
and
hid
itself
in
her
heart
.
She
began
to
shuffle
her
*NL*
cards
furiously
.
``
I
'm
angry
with
you
,
Emil
,
''
she
broke
out
with
*NL*
petulance
.
``
Why
did
you
give
them
that
lovely
blue
stone
to
sell
?
*NL*
You
might
have
known
Frank
would
n't
buy
it
for
me
,
and
I
wanted
it
*NL*
awfully
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Emil
laughed
shortly
.
``
People
who
want
such
little
things
surely
*NL*
ought
to
have
them
,
''
he
said
dryly
.
He
thrust
his
hand
into
the
*NL*
pocket
of
his
velvet
trousers
and
brought
out
a
handful
of
uncut
*NL*
turquoises
,
as
big
as
marbles
.
Leaning
over
the
table
he
dropped
*NL*
them
into
her
lap
.
``
There
,
will
those
do
?
Be
careful
,
do
n't
let
*NL*
any
one
see
them
.
Now
,
I
suppose
you
want
me
to
go
away
and
let
*NL*
you
play
with
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marie
was
gazing
in
rapture
at
the
soft
blue
color
of
the
stones
.
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Emil
!
Is
everything
down
there
beautiful
like
these
?
How
*NL*
could
you
ever
come
away
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
instant
Amedee
laid
hands
on
the
switchboard
.
There
was
a
*NL*
shiver
and
a
giggle
,
and
every
one
looked
toward
the
red
blur
that
*NL*
Marie
's
candle
made
in
the
dark
.
Immediately
that
,
too
,
was
gone
.
*NL*
Little
shrieks
and
currents
of
soft
laughter
ran
up
and
down
the
*NL*
dark
hall
.
Marie
started
up
,
--
directly
into
Emil
's
arms
.
In
the
*NL*
same
instant
she
felt
his
lips
.
The
veil
that
had
hung
uncertainly
*NL*
between
them
for
so
long
was
dissolved
.
Before
she
knew
what
she
*NL*
was
doing
,
she
had
committed
herself
to
that
kiss
that
was
at
once
*NL*
a
boy
's
and
a
man
's
,
as
timid
as
it
was
tender
;
so
like
Emil
and
*NL*
so
unlike
any
one
else
in
the
world
.
Not
until
it
was
over
did
*NL*
she
realize
what
it
meant
.
And
Emil
,
who
had
so
often
imagined
*NL*
the
shock
of
this
first
kiss
,
was
surprised
at
its
gentleness
and
*NL*
naturalness
.
It
was
like
a
sigh
which
they
had
breathed
together
;
*NL*
almost
sorrowful
,
as
if
each
were
afraid
of
wakening
something
in
*NL*
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
lights
came
on
again
,
everybody
was
laughing
and
shouting
,
*NL*
and
all
the
French
girls
were
rosy
and
shining
with
mirth
.
Only
*NL*
Marie
,
in
her
little
tent
of
shawls
,
was
pale
and
quiet
.
Under
her
*NL*
yellow
turban
the
red
coral
pendants
swung
against
white
cheeks
.
*NL*
Frank
was
still
staring
at
her
,
but
he
seemed
to
see
nothing
.
Years
*NL*
ago
,
he
himself
had
had
the
power
to
take
the
blood
from
her
cheeks
*NL*
like
that
.
Perhaps
he
did
not
remember
--
perhaps
he
had
never
*NL*
noticed
!
Emil
was
already
at
the
other
end
of
the
hall
,
walking
*NL*
about
with
the
shoulder-motion
he
had
acquired
among
the
Mexicans
,
*NL*
studying
the
floor
with
his
intent
,
deep-set
eyes
.
Marie
began
to
*NL*
take
down
and
fold
her
shawls
.
She
did
not
glance
up
again
.
The
*NL*
young
people
drifted
to
the
other
end
of
the
hall
where
the
guitar
*NL*
was
sounding
.
In
a
moment
she
heard
Emil
and
Raoul
singing
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Across
the
Rio
Grand-e
There
lies
a
sunny
land-e
,
My
bright-eyed
*NL*
Mexico
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Alexandra
Bergson
came
up
to
the
card
booth
.
``
Let
me
help
you
,
*NL*
Marie
.
You
look
tired
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
placed
her
hand
on
Marie
's
arm
and
felt
her
shiver
.
Marie
*NL*
stiffened
under
that
kind
,
calm
hand
.
Alexandra
drew
back
,
perplexed
*NL*
and
hurt
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
about
Alexandra
something
of
the
impervious
calm
of
the
*NL*
fatalist
,
always
disconcerting
to
very
young
people
,
who
can
not
*NL*
feel
that
the
heart
lives
at
all
unless
it
is
still
at
the
mercy
*NL*
of
storms
;
unless
its
strings
can
scream
to
the
touch
of
pain
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
II
*NL*
*NL*
Signa
's
wedding
supper
was
over
.
The
guests
,
and
the
tiresome
*NL*
little
Norwegian
preacher
who
had
performed
the
marriage
ceremony
,
*NL*
were
saying
good-night
.
Old
Ivar
was
hitching
the
horses
to
the
*NL*
wagon
to
take
the
wedding
presents
and
the
bride
and
groom
up
to
*NL*
their
new
home
,
on
Alexandra
's
north
quarter
.
When
Ivar
drove
up
*NL*
to
the
gate
,
Emil
and
Marie
Shabata
began
to
carry
out
the
presents
,
*NL*
and
Alexandra
went
into
her
bedroom
to
bid
Signa
good-bye
and
to
*NL*
give
her
a
few
words
of
good
counsel
.
She
was
surprised
to
find
*NL*
that
the
bride
had
changed
her
slippers
for
heavy
shoes
and
was
*NL*
pinning
up
her
skirts
.
At
that
moment
Nelse
appeared
at
the
gate
*NL*
with
the
two
milk
cows
that
Alexandra
had
given
Signa
for
a
wedding
*NL*
present
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alexandra
began
to
laugh
.
``
Why
,
Signa
,
you
and
Nelse
are
to
ride
*NL*
home
.
I
'll
send
Ivar
over
with
the
cows
in
the
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Signa
hesitated
and
looked
perplexed
.
When
her
husband
called
her
,
*NL*
she
pinned
her
hat
on
resolutely
.
``
I
ta-ank
I
better
do
yust
like
*NL*
he
say
,
''
she
murmured
in
confusion
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alexandra
and
Marie
accompanied
Signa
to
the
gate
and
saw
the
*NL*
party
set
off
,
old
Ivar
driving
ahead
in
the
wagon
and
the
bride
*NL*
and
groom
following
on
foot
,
each
leading
a
cow
.
Emil
burst
into
*NL*
a
laugh
before
they
were
out
of
hearing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Those
two
will
get
on
,
''
said
Alexandra
as
they
turned
back
to
the
*NL*
house
.
``
They
are
not
going
to
take
any
chances
.
They
will
feel
*NL*
safer
with
those
cows
in
their
own
stable
.
Marie
,
I
am
going
to
*NL*
send
for
an
old
woman
next
.
As
soon
as
I
get
the
girls
broken
in
,
*NL*
I
marry
them
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
no
patience
with
Signa
,
marrying
that
grumpy
fellow
!
''
Marie
*NL*
declared
.
``
I
wanted
her
to
marry
that
nice
Smirka
boy
who
worked
*NL*
for
us
last
winter
.
I
think
she
liked
him
,
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
think
she
did
,
''
Alexandra
assented
,
``
but
I
suppose
she
was
*NL*
too
much
afraid
of
Nelse
to
marry
any
one
else
.
Now
that
I
think
*NL*
of
it
,
most
of
my
girls
have
married
men
they
were
afraid
of
.
I
*NL*
believe
there
is
a
good
deal
of
the
cow
in
most
Swedish
girls
.
*NL*
You
high-strung
Bohemian
ca
n't
understand
us
.
We
're
a
terribly
*NL*
practical
people
,
and
I
guess
we
think
a
cross
man
makes
a
good
*NL*

*NL*
Marie
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
turned
to
pin
up
a
lock
of
hair
*NL*
that
had
fallen
on
her
neck
.
Somehow
Alexandra
had
irritated
her
*NL*
of
late
.
Everybody
irritated
her
.
She
was
tired
of
everybody
.
``
I
'm
*NL*
going
home
alone
,
Emil
,
so
you
need
n't
get
your
hat
,
''
she
said
as
*NL*
she
wound
her
scarf
quickly
about
her
head
.
``
Good-night
,
Alexandra
,
''
*NL*
she
called
back
in
a
strained
voice
,
running
down
the
gravel
walk
.
*NL*
*NL*
Emil
followed
with
long
strides
until
he
overtook
her
.
Then
she
began
*NL*
to
walk
slowly
.
It
was
a
night
of
warm
wind
and
faint
starlight
,
*NL*
and
the
fireflies
were
glimmering
over
the
wheat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Marie
,
''
said
Emil
after
they
had
walked
for
a
while
,
``
I
wonder
if
*NL*
you
know
how
unhappy
I
am
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marie
did
not
answer
him
.
Her
head
,
in
its
white
scarf
,
drooped
*NL*
forward
a
little
.
*NL*
*NL*
Emil
kicked
a
clod
from
the
path
and
went
on
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wonder
whether
you
are
really
shallow-hearted
,
like
you
seem
?
*NL*
Sometimes
I
think
one
boy
does
just
as
well
as
another
for
you
.
*NL*
It
never
seems
to
make
much
difference
whether
it
is
me
or
Raoul
*NL*
Marcel
or
Jan
Smirka
.
Are
you
really
like
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
I
am
.
What
do
you
want
me
to
do
?
Sit
round
and
cry
all
*NL*
day
?
When
I
've
cried
until
I
ca
n't
cry
any
more
,
then
--
then
I
must
*NL*
do
something
else
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
sorry
for
me
?
''
he
persisted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
'm
not
.
If
I
were
big
and
free
like
you
,
I
would
n't
let
*NL*
anything
make
me
unhappy
.
As
old
Napoleon
Brunot
said
at
the
fair
,
*NL*
I
would
n't
go
lovering
after
no
woman
.
I
'd
take
the
first
train
*NL*
and
go
off
and
have
all
the
fun
there
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
tried
that
,
but
it
did
n't
do
any
good
.
Everything
reminded
me
.
*NL*
The
nicer
the
place
was
,
the
more
I
wanted
you
.
''
They
had
come
to
*NL*
the
stile
and
Emil
pointed
to
it
persuasively
.
``
Sit
down
a
moment
,
*NL*
I
want
to
ask
you
something
.
''
Marie
sat
down
on
the
top
step
and
*NL*
Emil
drew
nearer
.
``
Would
you
tell
me
something
that
's
none
of
my
*NL*
business
if
you
thought
it
would
help
me
out
?
Well
,
then
,
tell
*NL*
me
,
PLEASE
tell
me
,
why
you
ran
away
with
Frank
Shabata
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marie
drew
back
.
``
Because
I
was
in
love
with
him
,
''
she
said
firmly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
?
''
he
asked
incredulously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
indeed
.
Very
much
in
love
with
him
.
I
think
I
was
the
one
*NL*
who
suggested
our
running
away
.
From
the
first
it
was
more
my
*NL*
fault
than
his
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Emil
turned
away
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
,
''
Marie
went
on
,
``
I
've
got
to
remember
that
.
Frank
is
*NL*
just
the
same
now
as
he
was
then
,
only
then
I
would
see
him
as
I
*NL*
wanted
him
to
be
.
I
would
have
my
own
way
.
And
now
I
pay
for
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
do
all
the
paying

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
it

When
one
makes
a
mistake

there
's
no
telling
where
*NL*
it
will
stop

But
you
can
go
away
;
you
can
leave
all
this
behind
*NL*
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
everything

I
ca
n't
leave
you
behind

Will
you
go
away
with
*NL*
me

Marie

''
*NL*
*NL*
Marie
started
up
and
stepped
across
the
stile
.
``
Emil
!
How
wickedly
*NL*
you
talk
!
I
am
not
that
kind
of
a
girl
,
and
you
know
it
.
But
what
*NL*
am
I
going
to
do
if
you
keep
tormenting
me
like
this

she
added
*NL*
plaintively
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Marie

I
wo
n't
bother
you
any
more

will
tell

just
*NL*
one
thing

Stop
a
minute
and
look
at
me

No
,
nobody
can
see
us

*NL*
Everybody
's
asleep

That
was
only
a
firefly

Marie
,
STOP
and
tell
*NL*
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Emil
overtook
her
and
catching
her
by
the
shoulders
shook
her
*NL*
gently
,
as
if
he
were
trying
to
awaken
a
sleepwalker
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marie
hid
her
face
on
his
arm
.
``
Do
n't
ask
me
anything
more
.
I
*NL*
do
n't
know
anything
except
how
miserable
I
am

And
I
thought
it
*NL*
would
be
all
right
when
you
came
back
.
Oh
,
Emil
,
''
she
clutched
his
*NL*
sleeve
and
began
to
cry
,
``
what
am
I
to
do
if
you
do
n't
go
away
?
I
*NL*
ca
n't
go
,
and
one
of
us
must
.
Ca
n't
you
see
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Emil
stood
looking
down
at
her
,
holding
his
shoulders
stiff
and
*NL*
stiffening
the
arm
to
which
she
clung
.
Her
white
dress
looked
*NL*
gray
in
the
darkness
.
She
seemed
like
a
troubled
spirit
,
like
some
*NL*
shadow
out
of
the
earth
,
clinging
to
him
and
entreating
him
to
give
*NL*
her
peace
.
Behind
her
the
fireflies
were
weaving
in
and
out
over
*NL*
the
wheat
.
He
put
his
hand
on
her
bent
head
.
``
On
my
honor
,
Marie
,
*NL*
if
you
will
say
you
love
me
,
I
will
go
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
lifted
her
face
to
his
.
``
How
could
I
help
it
?
Did
n't
you
*NL*
know
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Emil
was
the
one
who
trembled
,
through
all
his
frame
.
After
he
*NL*
left
Marie
at
her
gate
,
he
wandered
about
the
fields
all
night
,
*NL*
till
morning
put
out
the
fireflies
and
the
stars
.
*NL*

III
*NL*
*NL*
One
evening
,
a
week
after
Signa
's
wedding
,
Emil
was
kneeling
before
*NL*
a
box
in
the
sitting-room
,
packing
his
books
.
From
time
to
time
*NL*
he
rose
and
wandered
about
the
house
,
picking
up
stray
volumes
and
*NL*
bringing
them
listlessly
back
to
his
box
.
He
was
packing
without
*NL*
enthusiasm
.
He
was
not
very
sanguine
about
his
future
.
Alexandra
*NL*
sat
sewing
by
the
table
.
She
had
helped
him
pack
his
trunk
in
*NL*
the
afternoon
.
As
Emil
came
and
went
by
her
chair
with
his
books
,
*NL*
he
thought
to
himself
that
it
had
not
been
so
hard
to
leave
his
*NL*
sister
since
he
first
went
away
to
school
.
He
was
going
directly
*NL*
to
Omaha
,
to
read
law
in
the
office
of
a
Swedish
lawyer
until
*NL*
October
,
when
he
would
enter
the
law
school
at
Ann
Arbor
.
They
*NL*
had
planned
that
Alexandra
was
to
come
to
Michigan
--
a
long
journey
*NL*
for
her
--
at
Christmas
time
,
and
spend
several
weeks
with
him
.
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
he
felt
that
this
leave-taking
would
be
more
final
*NL*
than
his
earlier
ones
had
been
;
that
it
meant
a
definite
break
with
*NL*
his
old
home
and
the
beginning
of
something
new
--
he
did
not
know
*NL*
what
.
His
ideas
about
the
future
would
not
crystallize
;
the
more
*NL*
he
tried
to
think
about
it
,
the
vaguer
his
conception
of
it
became
.
*NL*
But
one
thing
was
clear
,
he
told
himself
;
it
was
high
time
that
he
*NL*
made
good
to
Alexandra
,
and
that
ought
to
be
incentive
enough
to
*NL*
begin
with
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
went
about
gathering
up
his
books
he
felt
as
if
he
were
*NL*
uprooting
things
.
At
last
he
threw
himself
down
on
the
old
slat
*NL*
lounge
where
he
had
slept
when
he
was
little
,
and
lay
looking
up
*NL*
at
the
familiar
cracks
in
the
ceiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tired
,
Emil
?
''
his
sister
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lazy
,
''
he
murmured
,
turning
on
his
side
and
looking
at
her
.
He
*NL*
studied
Alexandra
's
face
for
a
long
time
in
the
lamplight
.
It
had
*NL*
never
occurred
to
him
that
his
sister
was
a
handsome
woman
until
*NL*
Marie
Shabata
had
told
him
so
.
Indeed
,
he
had
never
thought
of
*NL*
her
as
being
a
woman
at
all
,
only
a
sister
.
As
he
studied
her
bent
*NL*
head
,
he
looked
up
at
the
picture
of
John
Bergson
above
the
lamp
.
*NL*
``
No
,
''
he
thought
to
himself
,
``
she
did
n't
get
it
there
.
I
suppose
*NL*
I
am
more
like
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alexandra
,
''
he
said
suddenly
,
``
that
old
walnut
secretary
you
use
*NL*
for
a
desk
was
father
's
,
was
n't
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alexandra
went
on
stitching
.
``
Yes
.
It
was
one
of
the
first
things
*NL*
he
bought
for
the
old
log
house
.
It
was
a
great
extravagance
*NL*
in
those
days
.
But
he
wrote
a
great
many
letters
back
to
the
old
*NL*
country
.
He
had
many
friends
there
,
and
they
wrote
to
him
up
to
the
*NL*
time
he
died
.
No
one
ever
blamed
him
for
grandfather
's
disgrace
.
*NL*
I
can
see
him
now
,
sitting
there
on
Sundays
,
in
his
white
shirt
,
*NL*
writing
pages
and
pages
,
so
carefully
.
He
wrote
a
fine
,
regular
*NL*
hand
,
almost
like
engraving
.
Yours
is
something
like
his
,
when
*NL*
you
take
pains
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Grandfather
was
really
crooked
,
was
he
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
married
an
unscrupulous
woman
,
and
then
--
then
I
'm
afraid
he
*NL*
was
really
crooked
.
When
we
first
came
here
father
used
to
have
*NL*
dreams
about
making
a
great
fortune
and
going
back
to
Sweden
to
*NL*
pay
back
to
the
poor
sailors
the
money
grandfather
had
lost
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Emil
stirred
on
the
lounge
.
``
I
say
,
that
would
have
been
worth
*NL*
while
,
would
n't
it
?
Father
was
n't
a
bit
like
Lou
or
Oscar
,
was
*NL*
he
?
I
ca
n't
remember
much
about
him
before
he
got
sick
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
not
at
all
!
''
Alexandra
dropped
her
sewing
on
her
knee
.
``
He
*NL*
had
better
opportunities
;
not
to
make
money
,
but
to
make
something
*NL*
of
himself
.
He
was
a
quiet
man
,
but
he
was
very
intelligent
.
You
*NL*
would
have
been
proud
of
him
,
Emil
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alexandra
felt
that
he
would
like
to
know
there
had
been
a
man
of
*NL*
his
kin
whom
he
could
admire
.
She
knew
that
Emil
was
ashamed
of
*NL*
Lou
and
Oscar
,
because
they
were
bigoted
and
self-satisfied
.
He
*NL*
never
said
much
about
them
,
but
she
could
feel
his
disgust
.
His
*NL*
brothers
had
shown
their
disapproval
of
him
ever
since
he
first
*NL*
went
away
to
school
.
The
only
thing
that
would
have
satisfied
them
*NL*
would
have
been
his
failure
at
the
University
.
As
it
was
,
they
*NL*
resented
every
change
in
his
speech
,
in
his
dress
,
in
his
point
of
*NL*
view
;
though
the
latter
they
had
to
conjecture
,
for
Emil
avoided
*NL*
talking
to
them
about
any
but
family
matters
.
All
his
interests
*NL*
they
treated
as
affectations
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alexandra
took
up
her
sewing
again
.
``
I
can
remember
father
when
*NL*
he
was
quite
a
young
man
.
He
belonged
to
some
kind
of
a
musical
*NL*
society
,
a
male
chorus
,
in
Stockholm
.
I
can
remember
going
with
*NL*
mother
to
hear
them
sing
.
There
must
have
been
a
hundred
of
them
,
*NL*
and
they
all
wore
long
black
coats
and
white
neckties
.
I
was
*NL*
used
to
seeing
father
in
a
blue
coat
,
a
sort
of
jacket
,
and
when
I
*NL*
recognized
him
on
the
platform
,
I
was
very
proud
.
Do
you
remember
*NL*
that
Swedish
song
he
taught
you
,
about
the
ship
boy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
I
used
to
sing
it
to
the
Mexicans
.
They
like
anything
*NL*
different
.
''
Emil
paused
.
``
Father
had
a
hard
fight
here
,
did
n't
*NL*
he
?
''
he
added
thoughtfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
and
he
died
in
a
dark
time
.
Still
,
he
had
hope
.
He
believed
*NL*
in
the
land
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
in
you
,
I
guess
,
''
Emil
said
to
himself
.
There
was
another
*NL*
period
of
silence
;
that
warm
,
friendly
silence
,
full
of
perfect
*NL*
understanding
,
in
which
Emil
and
Alexandra
had
spent
many
of
their
*NL*
happiest
half-hours
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
Emil
said
abruptly
,
``
Lou
and
Oscar
would
be
better
off
if
*NL*
they
were
poor
,
would
n't
they
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alexandra
smiled
.
``
Maybe
.
But
their
children
would
n't
.
I
have
*NL*
great
hopes
of
Milly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Emil
shivered
.
``
I
do
n't
know
.
Seems
to
me
it
gets
worse
as
it
*NL*
goes
on
.
The
worst
of
the
Swedes
is
that
they
're
never
willing
*NL*
to
find
out
how
much
they
do
n't
know
.
It
was
like
that
at
the
*NL*
University
.
Always
so
pleased
with
themselves
!
There
's
no
getting
*NL*
behind
that
conceited
Swedish
grin
.
The
Bohemians
and
Germans
were
*NL*
so
different
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
Emil
,
do
n't
go
back
on
your
own
people
.
Father
was
n't
*NL*
conceited
,
Uncle
Otto
was
n't
.
Even
Lou
and
Oscar
were
n't
when
they
*NL*
were
boys
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Emil
looked
incredulous
,
but
he
did
not
dispute
the
point
.
He
*NL*
turned
on
his
back
and
lay
still
for
a
long
time
,
his
hands
locked
*NL*
under
his
head
,
looking
up
at
the
ceiling
.
Alexandra
knew
that
he
*NL*
was
thinking
of
many
things
.
She
felt
no
anxiety
about
Emil
.
She
*NL*
had
always
believed
in
him
,
as
she
had
believed
in
the
land
.
He
*NL*
had
been
more
like
himself
since
he
got
back
from
Mexico
;
seemed
*NL*
glad
to
be
at
home
,
and
talked
to
her
as
he
used
to
do
.
She
had
*NL*
no
doubt
that
his
wandering
fit
was
over
,
and
that
he
would
soon
*NL*
be
settled
in
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alexandra
,
''
said
Emil
suddenly
,
``
do
you
remember
the
wild
duck
we
*NL*
saw
down
on
the
river
that
time
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
sister
looked
up
.
``
I
often
think
of
her
.
It
always
seems
to
*NL*
me
she
's
there
still
,
just
like
we
saw
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
.
It
's
queer
what
things
one
remembers
and
what
things
one
*NL*
forgets
.
''
Emil
yawned
and
sat
up
.
``
Well
,
it
's
time
to
turn
in
.
''
*NL*
He
rose
,
and
going
over
to
Alexandra
stooped
down
and
kissed
her
*NL*
lightly
on
the
cheek
.
``
Good-night
,
sister
.
I
think
you
did
pretty
*NL*
well
by
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Emil
took
up
his
lamp
and
went
upstairs
.
Alexandra
sat
finishing
*NL*
his
new
nightshirt
,
that
must
go
in
the
top
tray
of
his
trunk
.

The
next
morning
Angelique
,
Amedee
's
wife
,
was
in
the
kitchen
baking
*NL*
pies
,
assisted
by
old
Mrs.
Chevalier
.
Between
the
mixing-board
*NL*
and
the
stove
stood
the
old
cradle
that
had
been
Amedee
's
,
and
in
*NL*
it
was
his
black-eyed
son
.
As
Angelique
,
flushed
and
excited
,
with
*NL*
flour
on
her
hands
,
stopped
to
smile
at
the
baby
,
Emil
Bergson
rode
*NL*
up
to
the
kitchen
door
on
his
mare
and
dismounted
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Medee
is
out
in
the
field
,
Emil
,
''
Angelique
called
as
she
ran
*NL*
across
the
kitchen
to
the
oven
.
``
He
begins
to
cut
his
wheat
to-day
;
*NL*
the
first
wheat
ready
to
cut
anywhere
about
here
.
He
bought
a
new
*NL*
header
,
you
know
,
because
all
the
wheat
's
so
short
this
year
.
I
*NL*
hope
he
can
rent
it
to
the
neighbors
,
it
cost
so
much
.
He
and
his
*NL*
cousins
bought
a
steam
thresher
on
shares
.
You
ought
to
go
out
and
*NL*
see
that
header
work
.
I
watched
it
an
hour
this
morning
,
busy
as
*NL*
I
am
with
all
the
men
to
feed
.
He
has
a
lot
of
hands
,
but
he
's
*NL*
the
only
one
that
knows
how
to
drive
the
header
or
how
to
run
the
*NL*
engine
,
so
he
has
to
be
everywhere
at
once
.
He
's
sick
,
too
,
and
*NL*
ought
to
be
in
his
bed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Emil
bent
over
Hector
Baptiste
,
trying
to
make
him
blink
his
round
,
*NL*
bead-like
black
eyes
.
``
Sick
?
What
's
the
matter
with
your
daddy
,
*NL*
kid
?
Been
making
him
walk
the
floor
with
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Angelique
sniffed
.
``
Not
much
!
We
do
n't
have
that
kind
of
babies
.
*NL*
It
was
his
father
that
kept
Baptiste
awake
.
All
night
I
had
to
be
*NL*
getting
up
and
making
mustard
plasters
to
put
on
his
stomach
.
He
*NL*
had
an
awful
colic
.
He
said
he
felt
better
this
morning
,
but
I
*NL*
do
n't
think
he
ought
to
be
out
in
the
field
,
overheating
himself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Angelique
did
not
speak
with
much
anxiety
,
not
because
she
was
*NL*
indifferent
,
but
because
she
felt
so
secure
in
their
good
fortune
.
*NL*
Only
good
things
could
happen
to
a
rich
,
energetic
,
handsome
young
*NL*
man
like
Amedee
,
with
a
new
baby
in
the
cradle
and
a
new
header
in
*NL*
the
field
.
*NL*
*NL*
Emil
stroked
the
black
fuzz
on
Baptiste
's
head
.
``
I
say
,
Angelique
,
*NL*
one
of
`
Medee
's
grandmothers
,
`
way
back
,
must
have
been
a
squaw
.
*NL*
This
kid
looks
exactly
like
the
Indian
babies
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Angelique
made
a
face
at
him
,
but
old
Mrs.
Chevalier
had
been
*NL*
touched
on
a
sore
point
,
and
she
let
out
such
a
stream
of
fiery
*NL*
PATOIS
that
Emil
fled
from
the
kitchen
and
mounted
his
mare
.
*NL*
*NL*
Opening
the
pasture
gate
from
the
saddle
,
Emil
rode
across
the
field
*NL*
to
the
clearing
where
the
thresher
stood
,
driven
by
a
stationary
*NL*
engine
and
fed
from
the
header
boxes
.
As
Amedee
was
not
on
the
*NL*
engine
,
Emil
rode
on
to
the
wheatfield
,
where
he
recognized
,
on
*NL*
the
header
,
the
slight
,
wiry
figure
of
his
friend
,
coatless
,
his
*NL*
white
shirt
puffed
out
by
the
wind
,
his
straw
hat
stuck
jauntily
*NL*
on
the
side
of
his
head
.
The
six
big
work-horses
that
drew
,
or
*NL*
rather
pushed
,
the
header
,
went
abreast
at
a
rapid
walk
,
and
as
they
*NL*
were
still
green
at
the
work
they
required
a
good
deal
of
management
*NL*
on
Amedee
's
part
;
especially
when
they
turned
the
corners
,
where
*NL*
they
divided
,
three
and
three
,
and
then
swung
round
into
line
again
*NL*
with
a
movement
that
looked
as
complicated
as
a
wheel
of
artillery
.
*NL*
Emil
felt
a
new
thrill
of
admiration
for
his
friend
,
and
with
it
*NL*
the
old
pang
of
envy
at
the
way
in
which
Amedee
could
do
with
his
*NL*
might
what
his
hand
found
to
do
,
and
feel
that
,
whatever
it
was
,
*NL*
it
was
the
most
important
thing
in
the
world
.
``
I
'll
have
to
bring
*NL*
Alexandra
up
to
see
this
thing
work
,
''
Emil
thought
;
``
it
's
splendid
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
saw
Emil
,
Amedee
waved
to
him
and
called
to
one
of
his
*NL*
twenty
cousins
to
take
the
reins
.
Stepping
off
the
header
without
*NL*
stopping
it
,
he
ran
up
to
Emil
who
had
dismounted
.
``
Come
along
,
''
*NL*
he
called
.
``
I
have
to
go
over
to
the
engine
for
a
minute
.
I
got
ta
*NL*
green
man
running
it
,
and
I
got
ta
to
keep
an
eye
on
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Emil
thought
the
lad
was
unnaturally
flushed
and
more
excited
than
*NL*
even
the
cares
of
managing
a
big
farm
at
a
critical
time
warranted
.
*NL*
As
they
passed
behind
a
last
year
's
stack
,
Amedee
clutched
at
his
*NL*
right
side
and
sank
down
for
a
moment
on
the
straw
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ouch
!
I
got
an
awful
pain
in
me
,
Emil
.
Something
's
the
matter
*NL*
with
my
insides
,
for
sure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Emil
felt
his
fiery
cheek
.
``
You
ought
to
go
straight
to
bed
,
*NL*
`
Medee
,
and
telephone
for
the
doctor
;
that
's
what
you
ought
to
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Amedee
staggered
up
with
a
gesture
of
despair
.
``
How
can
I
?
I
got
*NL*
no
time
to
be
sick
.
Three
thousand
dollars
'
worth
of
new
machinery
*NL*
to
manage
,
and
the
wheat
so
ripe
it
will
begin
to
shatter
next
*NL*
week
.
My
wheat
's
short
,
but
it
's
got
ta
grand
full
berries
.
What
's
*NL*
he
slowing
down
for
?
We
have
n't
got
header
boxes
enough
to
feed
*NL*
the
thresher
,
I
guess
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Amedee
started
hot-foot
across
the
stubble
,
leaning
a
little
to
the
*NL*
right
as
he
ran
,
and
waved
to
the
engineer
not
to
stop
the
engine
.
*NL*
*NL*
Emil
saw
that
this
was
no
time
to
talk
about
his
own
affairs
.
He
*NL*
mounted
his
mare
and
rode
on
to
Sainte-Agnes
,
to
bid
his
friends
*NL*
there
good-bye
.
He
went
first
to
see
Raoul
Marcel
,
and
found
him
*NL*
innocently
practising
the
``
Gloria
''
for
the
big
confirmation
service
*NL*
on
Sunday
while
he
polished
the
mirrors
of
his
father
's
saloon
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
Emil
rode
homewards
at
three
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
,
he
saw
*NL*
Amedee
staggering
out
of
the
wheatfield
,
supported
by
two
of
his
*NL*
cousins
.
Emil
stopped
and
helped
them
put
the
boy
to
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
When
Frank
Shabata
came
in
from
work
at
five
o'clock
that
evening
,
*NL*
old
Moses
Marcel
,
Raoul
's
father
,
telephoned
him
that
Amedee
had
*NL*
had
a
seizure
in
the
wheatfield
,
and
that
Doctor
Paradis
was
going
*NL*
to
operate
on
him
as
soon
as
the
Hanover
doctor
got
there
to
help
.
*NL*
Frank
dropped
a
word
of
this
at
the
table
,
bolted
his
supper
,
and
*NL*
rode
off
to
Sainte-Agnes
,
where
there
would
be
sympathetic
discussion
*NL*
of
Amedee
's
case
at
Marcel
's
saloon
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
Frank
was
gone
,
Marie
telephoned
Alexandra
.
It
was
a
*NL*
comfort
to
hear
her
friend
's
voice
.
Yes
,
Alexandra
knew
what
there
*NL*
was
to
be
known
about
Amedee
.
Emil
had
been
there
when
they
carried
*NL*
him
out
of
the
field
,
and
had
stayed
with
him
until
the
doctors
*NL*
operated
for
appendicitis
at
five
o'clock
.
They
were
afraid
it
*NL*
was
too
late
to
do
much
good
;
it
should
have
been
done
three
days
*NL*
ago
.
Amedee
was
in
a
very
bad
way
.
Emil
had
just
come
home
,
worn
*NL*
out
and
sick
himself
.
She
had
given
him
some
brandy
and
put
him
*NL*
to
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marie
hung
up
the
receiver
.
Poor
Amedee
's
illness
had
taken
on
a
*NL*
new
meaning
to
her
,
now
that
she
knew
Emil
had
been
with
him
.
And
*NL*
it
might
so
easily
have
been
the
other
way
--
Emil
who
was
ill
and
*NL*
Amedee
who
was
sad
!
Marie
looked
about
the
dusky
sitting-room
.
*NL*
She
had
seldom
felt
so
utterly
lonely
.
If
Emil
was
asleep
,
there
*NL*
was
not
even
a
chance
of
his
coming
;
and
she
could
not
go
to
*NL*
Alexandra
for
sympathy
.
She
meant
to
tell
Alexandra
everything
,
*NL*
as
soon
as
Emil
went
away
.
Then
whatever
was
left
between
them
*NL*
would
be
honest
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
could
not
stay
in
the
house
this
evening
.
Where
should
she
*NL*
go
?
She
walked
slowly
down
through
the
orchard
,
where
the
evening
*NL*
air
was
heavy
with
the
smell
of
wild
cotton
.
The
fresh
,
salty
scent
*NL*
of
the
wild
roses
had
given
way
before
this
more
powerful
perfume
*NL*
of
midsummer
.
Wherever
those
ashes-of-rose
balls
hung
on
their
*NL*
milky
stalks
,
the
air
about
them
was
saturated
with
their
breath
.
*NL*
The
sky
was
still
red
in
the
west
and
the
evening
star
hung
*NL*
directly
over
the
Bergsons
'
wind-mill
.
Marie
crossed
the
fence
at
*NL*
the
wheatfield
corner
,
and
walked
slowly
along
the
path
that
led
*NL*
to
Alexandra
's
.
She
could
not
help
feeling
hurt
that
Emil
had
not
*NL*
come
to
tell
her
about
Amedee
.
It
seemed
to
her
most
unnatural
*NL*
that
he
should
not
have
come
.
If
she
were
in
trouble
,
certainly
*NL*
he
was
the
one
person
in
the
world
she
would
want
to
see
.
Perhaps
*NL*
he
wished
her
to
understand
that
for
her
he
was
as
good
as
gone
*NL*
already
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marie
stole
slowly
,
flutteringly
,
along
the
path
,
like
a
white
*NL*
night-moth
out
of
the
fields
.
The
years
seemed
to
stretch
before
*NL*
her
like
the
land
;
spring
,
summer
,
autumn
,
winter
,
spring
;
always
*NL*
the
same
patient
fields
,
the
patient
little
trees
,
the
patient
lives
;
*NL*
always
the
same
yearning
,
the
same
pulling
at
the
chain
--
until
the
*NL*
instinct
to
live
had
torn
itself
and
bled
and
weakened
for
the
last
*NL*
time
,
until
the
chain
secured
a
dead
woman
,
who
might
cautiously
*NL*
be
released
.
Marie
walked
on
,
her
face
lifted
toward
the
remote
,
*NL*
inaccessible
evening
star
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
reached
the
stile
she
sat
down
and
waited
.
How
terrible
*NL*
it
was
to
love
people
when
you
could
not
really
share
their
lives
!
*NL*
*NL*
Yes
,
in
so
far
as
she
was
concerned
,
Emil
was
already
gone
.
They
*NL*
could
n't
meet
any
more
.
There
was
nothing
for
them
to
say
.
They
*NL*
had
spent
the
last
penny
of
their
small
change
;
there
was
nothing
*NL*
left
but
gold
.
The
day
of
love-tokens
was
past
.
They
had
now
*NL*
only
their
hearts
to
give
each
other
.
And
Emil
being
gone
,
what
*NL*
was
her
life
to
be
like
?
In
some
ways
,
it
would
be
easier
.
She
*NL*
would
not
,
at
least
,
live
in
perpetual
fear
.
If
Emil
were
once
*NL*
away
and
settled
at
work
,
she
would
not
have
the
feeling
that
she
*NL*
was
spoiling
his
life
.
With
the
memory
he
left
her
,
she
could
be
*NL*
as
rash
as
she
chose
.
Nobody
could
be
the
worse
for
it
but
herself
;
*NL*
and
that
,
surely
,
did
not
matter
.
Her
own
case
was
clear
.
When
a
*NL*
girl
had
loved
one
man
,
and
then
loved
another
while
that
man
was
*NL*
still
alive
,
everybody
knew
what
to
think
of
her
.
What
happened
*NL*
to
her
was
of
little
consequence
,
so
long
as
she
did
not
drag
other
*NL*
people
down
with
her
.
Emil
once
away
,
she
could
let
everything
*NL*
else
go
and
live
a
new
life
of
perfect
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marie
left
the
stile
reluctantly
.
She
had
,
after
all
,
thought
he
*NL*
might
come
.
And
how
glad
she
ought
to
be
,
she
told
herself
,
that
*NL*
he
was
asleep
.
She
left
the
path
and
went
across
the
pasture
.
The
*NL*
moon
was
almost
full
.
An
owl
was
hooting
somewhere
in
the
fields
.
*NL*
She
had
scarcely
thought
about
where
she
was
going
when
the
pond
*NL*
glittered
before
her
,
where
Emil
had
shot
the
ducks
.
She
stopped
*NL*
and
looked
at
it
.
Yes
,
there
would
be
a
dirty
way
out
of
life
,
if
*NL*
one
chose
to
take
it
.
But
she
did
not
want
to
die
.
She
wanted
to
*NL*
live
and
dream
--
a
hundred
years
,
forever
!
As
long
as
this
sweetness
*NL*
welled
up
in
her
heart
,
as
long
as
her
breast
could
hold
this
*NL*
treasure
of
pain
!
She
felt
as
the
pond
must
feel
when
it
held
the
*NL*
moon
like
that
;
when
it
encircled
and
swelled
with
that
image
of
*NL*
gold
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
morning
,
when
Emil
came
down-stairs
,
Alexandra
met
him
*NL*
in
the
sitting-room
and
put
her
hands
on
his
shoulders
.
``
Emil
,
I
*NL*
went
to
your
room
as
soon
as
it
was
light
,
but
you
were
sleeping
*NL*
so
sound
I
hated
to
wake
you
.
There
was
nothing
you
could
do
,
so
*NL*
I
let
you
sleep
.
They
telephoned
from
Sainte-Agnes
that
Amedee
*NL*
died
at
three
o'clock
this
morning
.

The
Church
has
always
held
that
life
is
for
the
living
.
On
Saturday
,
*NL*
while
half
the
village
of
Sainte-Agnes
was
mourning
for
Amedee
and
*NL*
preparing
the
funeral
black
for
his
burial
on
Monday
,
the
other
*NL*
half
was
busy
with
white
dresses
and
white
veils
for
the
great
*NL*
confirmation
service
to-morrow
,
when
the
bishop
was
to
confirm
a
*NL*
class
of
one
hundred
boys
and
girls
.
Father
Duchesne
divided
his
*NL*
time
between
the
living
and
the
dead
.
All
day
Saturday
the
church
*NL*
was
a
scene
of
bustling
activity
,
a
little
hushed
by
the
thought
*NL*
of
Amedee
.
The
choir
were
busy
rehearsing
a
mass
of
Rossini
,
which
*NL*
they
had
studied
and
practised
for
this
occasion
.
The
women
were
*NL*
trimming
the
altar
,
the
boys
and
girls
were
bringing
flowers
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
Sunday
morning
the
bishop
was
to
drive
overland
to
Sainte-Agnes
*NL*
from
Hanover
,
and
Emil
Bergson
had
been
asked
to
take
the
place
of
*NL*
one
of
Amedee
's
cousins
in
the
cavalcade
of
forty
French
boys
who
*NL*
were
to
ride
across
country
to
meet
the
bishop
's
carriage
.
At
*NL*
six
o'clock
on
Sunday
morning
the
boys
met
at
the
church
.
As
they
*NL*
stood
holding
their
horses
by
the
bridle
,
they
talked
in
low
tones
*NL*
of
their
dead
comrade
.
They
kept
repeating
that
Amedee
had
always
*NL*
been
a
good
boy
,
glancing
toward
the
red
brick
church
which
had
*NL*
played
so
large
a
part
in
Amedee
's
life
,
had
been
the
scene
of
his
*NL*
most
serious
moments
and
of
his
happiest
hours
.
He
had
played
and
*NL*
wrestled
and
sung
and
courted
under
its
shadow
.
Only
three
weeks
*NL*
ago
he
had
proudly
carried
his
baby
there
to
be
christened
.
They
*NL*
could
not
doubt
that
that
invisible
arm
was
still
about
Amedee
;
that
*NL*
through
the
church
on
earth
he
had
passed
to
the
church
triumphant
,
*NL*
the
goal
of
the
hopes
and
faith
of
so
many
hundred
years
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
word
was
given
to
mount
,
the
young
men
rode
at
a
walk
out
*NL*
of
the
village
;
but
once
out
among
the
wheatfields
in
the
morning
*NL*
sun
,
their
horses
and
their
own
youth
got
the
better
of
them
.
A
*NL*
wave
of
zeal
and
fiery
enthusiasm
swept
over
them
.
They
longed
*NL*
for
a
Jerusalem
to
deliver
.
The
thud
of
their
galloping
hoofs
*NL*
interrupted
many
a
country
breakfast
and
brought
many
a
woman
and
*NL*
child
to
the
door
of
the
farmhouses
as
they
passed
.
Five
miles
east
*NL*
of
Sainte-Agnes
they
met
the
bishop
in
his
open
carriage
,
attended
*NL*
by
two
priests
.
Like
one
man
the
boys
swung
off
their
hats
in
a
*NL*
broad
salute
,
and
bowed
their
heads
as
the
handsome
old
man
lifted
*NL*
his
two
fingers
in
the
episcopal
blessing
.
The
horsemen
closed
*NL*
about
the
carriage
like
a
guard
,
and
whenever
a
restless
horse
broke
*NL*
from
control
and
shot
down
the
road
ahead
of
the
body
,
the
bishop
*NL*
laughed
and
rubbed
his
plump
hands
together
.
``
What
fine
boys
!
''
he
*NL*
said
to
his
priests
.
``
The
Church
still
has
her
cavalry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
troop
swept
past
the
graveyard
half
a
mile
east
of
the
*NL*
town
,
--
the
first
frame
church
of
the
parish
had
stood
there
,
--
old
*NL*
Pierre
Seguin
was
already
out
with
his
pick
and
spade
,
digging
*NL*
Amedee
's
grave
.
He
knelt
and
uncovered
as
the
bishop
passed
.
The
*NL*
boys
with
one
accord
looked
away
from
old
Pierre
to
the
red
church
*NL*
on
the
hill
,
with
the
gold
cross
flaming
on
its
steeple
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mass
was
at
eleven
.
While
the
church
was
filling
,
Emil
Bergson
waited
*NL*
outside
,
watching
the
wagons
and
buggies
drive
up
the
hill
.
After
*NL*
the
bell
began
to
ring
,
he
saw
Frank
Shabata
ride
up
on
horseback
*NL*
and
tie
his
horse
to
the
hitch-bar
.
Marie
,
then
,
was
not
coming
.
*NL*
Emil
turned
and
went
into
the
church
.
Amedee
's
was
the
only
empty
*NL*
pew
,
and
he
sat
down
in
it
.
Some
of
Amedee
's
cousins
were
there
,
*NL*
dressed
in
black
and
weeping
.
When
all
the
pews
were
full
,
the
*NL*
old
men
and
boys
packed
the
open
space
at
the
back
of
the
church
,
*NL*
kneeling
on
the
floor
.
There
was
scarcely
a
family
in
town
that
was
*NL*
not
represented
in
the
confirmation
class
,
by
a
cousin
,
at
least
.
*NL*
The
new
communicants
,
with
their
clear
,
reverent
faces
,
were
beautiful
*NL*
to
look
upon
as
they
entered
in
a
body
and
took
the
front
benches
*NL*
reserved
for
them
.
Even
before
the
Mass
began
,
the
air
was
charged
*NL*
with
feeling
.
The
choir
had
never
sung
so
well
and
Raoul
Marcel
,
*NL*
in
the
``
Gloria
,
''
drew
even
the
bishop
's
eyes
to
the
organ
loft
.
*NL*
For
the
offertory
he
sang
Gounod
's
``
Ave
Maria
,
''
--
always
spoken
of
*NL*
in
Sainte-Agnes
as
``
the
Ave
Maria
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Emil
began
to
torture
himself
with
questions
about
Marie
.
Was
she
*NL*
ill
?
Had
she
quarreled
with
her
husband
?
Was
she
too
unhappy
to
*NL*
find
comfort
even
here
?
Had
she
,
perhaps
,
thought
that
he
would
*NL*
come
to
her
?
Was
she
waiting
for
him
?
Overtaxed
by
excitement
*NL*
and
sorrow
as
he
was
,
the
rapture
of
the
service
took
hold
upon
his
*NL*
body
and
mind
.
As
he
listened
to
Raoul
,
he
seemed
to
emerge
from
*NL*
the
conflicting
emotions
which
had
been
whirling
him
about
and
*NL*
sucking
him
under
.
He
felt
as
if
a
clear
light
broke
upon
his
*NL*
mind
,
and
with
it
a
conviction
that
good
was
,
after
all
,
stronger
*NL*
than
evil
,
and
that
good
was
possible
to
men
.
He
seemed
to
discover
*NL*
that
there
was
a
kind
of
rapture
in
which
he
could
love
forever
*NL*
without
faltering
and
without
sin
.
He
looked
across
the
heads
of
*NL*
the
people
at
Frank
Shabata
with
calmness
.
That
rapture
was
for
those
*NL*
who
could
feel
it
;
for
people
who
could
not
,
it
was
non-existent
.
*NL*
He
coveted
nothing
that
was
Frank
Shabata
's
.
The
spirit
he
had
*NL*
met
in
music
was
his
own
.
Frank
Shabata
had
never
found
it
;
would
*NL*
never
find
it
if
he
lived
beside
it
a
thousand
years
;
would
have
*NL*
destroyed
it
if
he
had
found
it
,
as
Herod
slew
the
innocents
,
as
*NL*
Rome
slew
the
martyrs
.
*NL*
*NL*
SAN
--
CTA
MARI-I-I-A
,
*NL*
*NL*
wailed
Raoul
from
the
organ
loft
;
*NL*
*NL*
O
--
RA
PRO
NO-O-BIS
!
*NL*
*NL*
And
it
did
not
occur
to
Emil
that
any
one
had
ever
reasoned
thus
*NL*
before
,
that
music
had
ever
before
given
a
man
this
equivocal
*NL*
revelation
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
confirmation
service
followed
the
Mass.
.
When
it
was
over
,
the
*NL*
congregation
thronged
about
the
newly
confirmed
.
The
girls
,
and
*NL*
even
the
boys
,
were
kissed
and
embraced
and
wept
over
.
All
the
*NL*
aunts
and
grandmothers
wept
with
joy
.
The
housewives
had
much
ado
*NL*
to
tear
themselves
away
from
the
general
rejoicing
and
hurry
back
*NL*
to
their
kitchens
.
The
country
parishioners
were
staying
in
town
*NL*
for
dinner
,
and
nearly
every
house
in
Sainte-Agnes
entertained
*NL*
visitors
that
day
.
Father
Duchesne
,
the
bishop
,
and
the
visiting
*NL*
priests
dined
with
Fabien
Sauvage
,
the
banker
.
Emil
and
Frank
*NL*
Shabata
were
both
guests
of
old
Moise
Marcel
.
After
dinner
Frank
*NL*
and
old
Moise
retired
to
the
rear
room
of
the
saloon
to
play
*NL*
California
Jack
and
drink
their
cognac
,
and
Emil
went
over
to
the
*NL*
banker
's
with
Raoul
,
who
had
been
asked
to
sing
for
the
bishop
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
three
o'clock
,
Emil
felt
that
he
could
stand
it
no
longer
.
He
*NL*
slipped
out
under
cover
of
``
The
Holy
City
,
''
followed
by
Malvina
's
*NL*
wistful
eye
,
and
went
to
the
stable
for
his
mare
.
He
was
at
that
*NL*
height
of
excitement
from
which
everything
is
foreshortened
,
from
*NL*
which
life
seems
short
and
simple
,
death
very
near
,
and
the
soul
*NL*
seems
to
soar
like
an
eagle
.
As
he
rode
past
the
graveyard
he
looked
*NL*
at
the
brown
hole
in
the
earth
where
Amedee
was
to
lie
,
and
felt
*NL*
no
horror
.
That
,
too
,
was
beautiful
,
that
simple
doorway
into
*NL*
forgetfulness
.
The
heart
,
when
it
is
too
much
alive
,
aches
for
*NL*
that
brown
earth
,
and
ecstasy
has
no
fear
of
death
.
It
is
the
old
*NL*
and
the
poor
and
the
maimed
who
shrink
from
that
brown
hole
;
its
*NL*
wooers
are
found
among
the
young
,
the
passionate
,
the
gallant-hearted
.
*NL*
It
was
not
until
he
had
passed
the
graveyard
that
Emil
realized
*NL*
where
he
was
going
.
It
was
the
hour
for
saying
good-bye
.
It
might
*NL*
be
the
last
time
that
he
would
see
her
alone
,
and
today
he
could
*NL*
leave
her
without
rancor
,
without
bitterness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everywhere
the
grain
stood
ripe
and
the
hot
afternoon
was
full
of
*NL*
the
smell
of
the
ripe
wheat
,
like
the
smell
of
bread
baking
in
an
*NL*
oven
.
The
breath
of
the
wheat
and
the
sweet
clover
passed
him
like
*NL*
pleasant
things
in
a
dream
.
He
could
feel
nothing
but
the
sense
of
*NL*
diminishing
distance
.
It
seemed
to
him
that
his
mare
was
flying
,
*NL*
or
running
on
wheels
,
like
a
railway
train
.
The
sunlight
,
flashing
*NL*
on
the
window-glass
of
the
big
red
barns
,
drove
him
wild
with
joy
.
*NL*
He
was
like
an
arrow
shot
from
the
bow
.
His
life
poured
itself
*NL*
out
along
the
road
before
him
as
he
rode
to
the
Shabata
farm
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Emil
alighted
at
the
Shabatas
'
gate
,
his
horse
was
in
a
lather
.
*NL*
He
tied
her
in
the
stable
and
hurried
to
the
house
.
It
was
empty
.
*NL*
She
might
be
at
Mrs.
Hiller
's
or
with
Alexandra
.
But
anything
*NL*
that
reminded
him
of
her
would
be
enough
,
the
orchard
,
the
mulberry
*NL*
tree
...
When
he
reached
the
orchard
the
sun
was
hanging
low
over
*NL*
the
wheatfield
.
Long
fingers
of
light
reached
through
the
apple
*NL*
branches
as
through
a
net
;
the
orchard
was
riddled
and
shot
with
*NL*
gold
;
light
was
the
reality
,
the
trees
were
merely
interferences
*NL*
that
reflected
and
refracted
light
.
Emil
went
softly
down
between
*NL*
the
cherry
trees
toward
the
wheatfield
.
When
he
came
to
the
corner
,
*NL*
he
stopped
short
and
put
his
hand
over
his
mouth
.
Marie
was
lying
*NL*
on
her
side
under
the
white
mulberry
tree
,
her
face
half
hidden
in
*NL*
the
grass
,
her
eyes
closed
,
her
hands
lying
limply
where
they
had
*NL*
happened
to
fall
.
She
had
lived
a
day
of
her
new
life
of
perfect
*NL*
love
,
and
it
had
left
her
like
this
.
Her
breast
rose
and
fell
*NL*
faintly
,
as
if
she
were
asleep
.
Emil
threw
himself
down
beside
*NL*
her
and
took
her
in
his
arms
.
The
blood
came
back
to
her
cheeks
,
*NL*
her
amber
eyes
opened
slowly
,
and
in
them
Emil
saw
his
own
face
*NL*
and
the
orchard
and
the
sun
.
``
I
was
dreaming
this
,
''
she
whispered
,
*NL*
hiding
her
face
against
him
,
``
do
n't
take
my
dream
away
!
''

VII
*NL*
*NL*
When
Frank
Shabata
got
home
that
night
,
he
found
Emil
's
mare
in
*NL*
his
stable
.
Such
an
impertinence
amazed
him
.
Like
everybody
else
,
*NL*
Frank
had
had
an
exciting
day
.
Since
noon
he
had
been
drinking
too
*NL*
much
,
and
he
was
in
a
bad
temper
.
He
talked
bitterly
to
himself
*NL*
while
he
put
his
own
horse
away
,
and
as
he
went
up
the
path
and
*NL*
saw
that
the
house
was
dark
he
felt
an
added
sense
of
injury
.
He
*NL*
approached
quietly
and
listened
on
the
doorstep
.
Hearing
nothing
,
*NL*
he
opened
the
kitchen
door
and
went
softly
from
one
room
to
another
.
*NL*
Then
he
went
through
the
house
again
,
upstairs
and
down
,
with
no
*NL*
better
result
.
He
sat
down
on
the
bottom
step
of
the
box
stairway
*NL*
and
tried
to
get
his
wits
together
.
In
that
unnatural
quiet
there
*NL*
was
no
sound
but
his
own
heavy
breathing
.
Suddenly
an
owl
began
*NL*
to
hoot
out
in
the
fields
.
Frank
lifted
his
head
.
An
idea
flashed
*NL*
into
his
mind
,
and
his
sense
of
injury
and
outrage
grew
.
He
went
*NL*
into
his
bedroom
and
took
his
murderous
405
Winchester
from
the
*NL*
closet
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Frank
took
up
his
gun
and
walked
out
of
the
house
,
he
had
not
*NL*
the
faintest
purpose
of
doing
anything
with
it
.
He
did
not
believe
*NL*
that
he
had
any
real
grievance
.
But
it
gratified
him
to
feel
like
*NL*
a
desperate
man
.
He
had
got
into
the
habit
of
seeing
himself
always
*NL*
in
desperate
straits
.
His
unhappy
temperament
was
like
a
cage
;
he
*NL*
could
never
get
out
of
it
;
and
he
felt
that
other
people
,
his
wife
*NL*
in
particular
,
must
have
put
him
there
.
It
had
never
more
than
*NL*
dimly
occurred
to
Frank
that
he
made
his
own
unhappiness
.
Though
*NL*
he
took
up
his
gun
with
dark
projects
in
his
mind
,
he
would
have
*NL*
been
paralyzed
with
fright
had
he
known
that
there
was
the
slightest
*NL*
probability
of
his
ever
carrying
any
of
them
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
Frank
went
slowly
down
to
the
orchard
gate
,
stopped
and
stood
for
*NL*
a
moment
lost
in
thought
.
He
retraced
his
steps
and
looked
through
*NL*
the
barn
and
the
hayloft
.
Then
he
went
out
to
the
road
,
where
he
*NL*
took
the
foot-path
along
the
outside
of
the
orchard
hedge
.
The
*NL*
hedge
was
twice
as
tall
as
Frank
himself
,
and
so
dense
that
one
*NL*
could
see
through
it
only
by
peering
closely
between
the
leaves
.
*NL*
He
could
see
the
empty
path
a
long
way
in
the
moonlight
.
His
mind
*NL*
traveled
ahead
to
the
stile
,
which
he
always
thought
of
as
haunted
*NL*
by
Emil
Bergson
.
But
why
had
he
left
his
horse
?
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
wheatfield
corner
,
where
the
orchard
hedge
ended
and
the
*NL*
path
led
across
the
pasture
to
the
Bergsons
'
,
Frank
stopped
.
In
*NL*
the
warm
,
breathless
night
air
he
heard
a
murmuring
sound
,
perfectly
*NL*
inarticulate
,
as
low
as
the
sound
of
water
coming
from
a
spring
,
*NL*
where
there
is
no
fall
,
and
where
there
are
no
stones
to
fret
it
.
*NL*
Frank
strained
his
ears
.
It
ceased
.
He
held
his
breath
and
began
*NL*
to
tremble
.
Resting
the
butt
of
his
gun
on
the
ground
,
he
parted
*NL*
the
mulberry
leaves
softly
with
his
fingers
and
peered
through
*NL*
the
hedge
at
the
dark
figures
on
the
grass
,
in
the
shadow
of
the
*NL*
mulberry
tree
.
It
seemed
to
him
that
they
must
feel
his
eyes
,
*NL*
that
they
must
hear
him
breathing
.
But
they
did
not
.
Frank
,
who
*NL*
had
always
wanted
to
see
things
blacker
than
they
were
,
for
once
*NL*
wanted
to
believe
less
than
he
saw
.
The
woman
lying
in
the
shadow
*NL*
might
so
easily
be
one
of
the
Bergsons
'
farm-girls
...
Again
*NL*
the
murmur
,
like
water
welling
out
of
the
ground
.
This
time
he
*NL*
heard
it
more
distinctly
,
and
his
blood
was
quicker
than
his
brain
.
*NL*
He
began
to
act
,
just
as
a
man
who
falls
into
the
fire
begins
to
*NL*
act
.
The
gun
sprang
to
his
shoulder
,
he
sighted
mechanically
and
*NL*
fired
three
times
without
stopping
,
stopped
without
knowing
why
.
*NL*
Either
he
shut
his
eyes
or
he
had
vertigo
.
He
did
not
see
anything
*NL*
while
he
was
firing
.
He
thought
he
heard
a
cry
simultaneous
with
*NL*
the
second
report
,
but
he
was
not
sure
.
He
peered
again
through
*NL*
the
hedge
,
at
the
two
dark
figures
under
the
tree
.
They
had
fallen
*NL*
a
little
apart
from
each
other
,
and
were
perfectly
still
--
No
,
*NL*
not
quite
;
in
a
white
patch
of
light
,
where
the
moon
shone
through
*NL*
the
branches
,
a
man
's
hand
was
plucking
spasmodically
at
the
grass
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
the
woman
stirred
and
uttered
a
cry
,
then
another
,
and
*NL*
another
.
She
was
living
!
She
was
dragging
herself
toward
the
*NL*
hedge
!
Frank
dropped
his
gun
and
ran
back
along
the
path
,
shaking
,
*NL*
stumbling
,
gasping
.
He
had
never
imagined
such
horror
.
The
*NL*
cries
followed
him
.
They
grew
fainter
and
thicker
,
as
if
she
were
*NL*
choking
.
He
dropped
on
his
knees
beside
the
hedge
and
crouched
*NL*
like
a
rabbit
,
listening
;
fainter
,
fainter
;
a
sound
like
a
whine
;
*NL*
again
--
a
moan
--
another
--
silence
.
Frank
scrambled
to
his
feet
and
*NL*
ran
on
,
groaning
and
praying
.
From
habit
he
went
toward
the
house
,
*NL*
where
he
was
used
to
being
soothed
when
he
had
worked
himself
into
*NL*
a
frenzy
,
but
at
the
sight
of
the
black
,
open
door
,
he
started
back
.
*NL*
He
knew
that
he
had
murdered
somebody
,
that
a
woman
was
bleeding
*NL*
and
moaning
in
the
orchard
,
but
he
had
not
realized
before
that
*NL*
it
was
his
wife
.
The
gate
stared
him
in
the
face
.
He
threw
his
*NL*
hands
over
his
head
.
Which
way
to
turn
?
He
lifted
his
tormented
*NL*
face
and
looked
at
the
sky
.
``
Holy
Mother
of
God
,
not
to
suffer
!
*NL*
She
was
a
good
girl
--
not
to
suffer
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Frank
had
been
wont
to
see
himself
in
dramatic
situations
;
but
*NL*
now
,
when
he
stood
by
the
windmill
,
in
the
bright
space
between
the
*NL*
barn
and
the
house
,
facing
his
own
black
doorway
,
he
did
not
see
*NL*
himself
at
all
.
He
stood
like
the
hare
when
the
dogs
are
approaching
*NL*
from
all
sides
.
And
he
ran
like
a
hare
,
back
and
forth
about
that
*NL*
moonlit
space
,
before
he
could
make
up
his
mind
to
go
into
the
*NL*
dark
stable
for
a
horse
.
The
thought
of
going
into
a
doorway
was
*NL*
terrible
to
him
.
He
caught
Emil
's
horse
by
the
bit
and
led
it
out
.
*NL*
He
could
not
have
buckled
a
bridle
on
his
own
.
After
two
or
three
*NL*
attempts
,
he
lifted
himself
into
the
saddle
and
started
for
Hanover
.
*NL*
If
he
could
catch
the
one
o'clock
train
,
he
had
money
enough
to
*NL*
get
as
far
as
Omaha
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
he
was
thinking
dully
of
this
in
some
less
sensitized
part
*NL*
of
his
brain
,
his
acuter
faculties
were
going
over
and
over
the
*NL*
cries
he
had
heard
in
the
orchard
.
Terror
was
the
only
thing
that
*NL*
kept
him
from
going
back
to
her
,
terror
that
she
might
still
be
*NL*
she
,
that
she
might
still
be
suffering
.
A
woman
,
mutilated
and
*NL*
bleeding
in
his
orchard
--
it
was
because
it
was
a
woman
that
he
*NL*
was
so
afraid
.
It
was
inconceivable
that
he
should
have
hurt
a
*NL*
woman
.
He
would
rather
be
eaten
by
wild
beasts
than
see
her
move
*NL*
on
the
ground
as
she
had
moved
in
the
orchard
.
Why
had
she
been
*NL*
so
careless
?
She
knew
he
was
like
a
crazy
man
when
he
was
angry
.
*NL*
She
had
more
than
once
taken
that
gun
away
from
him
and
held
it
,
*NL*
when
he
was
angry
with
other
people
.
Once
it
had
gone
off
while
*NL*
they
were
struggling
over
it
.
She
was
never
afraid
.
But
,
when
*NL*
she
knew
him
,
why
had
n't
she
been
more
careful
?
Did
n't
she
have
*NL*
all
summer
before
her
to
love
Emil
Bergson
in
,
without
taking
such
*NL*
chances
?
Probably
she
had
met
the
Smirka
boy
,
too
,
down
there
in
*NL*
the
orchard
.
He
did
n't
care
.
She
could
have
met
all
the
men
on
the
*NL*
Divide
there
,
and
welcome
,
if
only
she
had
n't
brought
this
horror
*NL*
on
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
wrench
in
Frank
's
mind
.
He
did
not
honestly
believe
that
*NL*
of
her
.
He
knew
that
he
was
doing
her
wrong
.
He
stopped
his
horse
*NL*
to
admit
this
to
himself
the
more
directly
,
to
think
it
out
the
more
*NL*
clearly
.
He
knew
that
he
was
to
blame
.
For
three
years
he
had
been
*NL*
trying
to
break
her
spirit
.
She
had
a
way
of
making
the
best
of
*NL*
things
that
seemed
to
him
a
sentimental
affectation
.
He
wanted
his
*NL*
wife
to
resent
that
he
was
wasting
his
best
years
among
these
stupid
*NL*
and
unappreciative
people
;
but
she
had
seemed
to
find
the
people
*NL*
quite
good
enough
.
If
he
ever
got
rich
he
meant
to
buy
her
pretty
*NL*
clothes
and
take
her
to
California
in
a
Pullman
car
,
and
treat
her
*NL*
like
a
lady
;
but
in
the
mean
time
he
wanted
her
to
feel
that
life
was
*NL*
as
ugly
and
as
unjust
as
he
felt
it
.
He
had
tried
to
make
her
life
*NL*
ugly
.
He
had
refused
to
share
any
of
the
little
pleasures
she
was
so
*NL*
plucky
about
making
for
herself
.
She
could
be
gay
about
the
least
*NL*
thing
in
the
world
;
but
she
must
be
gay
!
When
she
first
came
to
him
,
*NL*
her
faith
in
him
,
her
adoration
--
Frank
struck
the
mare
with
his
fist
.
*NL*
Why
had
Marie
made
him
do
this
thing
;
why
had
she
brought
this
upon
*NL*
him
?
He
was
overwhelmed
by
sickening
misfortune
.
All
at
once
he
*NL*
heard
her
cries
again
--
he
had
forgotten
for
a
moment
.
``
Maria
,
''
he
*NL*
sobbed
aloud
,
``
Maria
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
Frank
was
halfway
to
Hanover
,
the
motion
of
his
horse
brought
*NL*
on
a
violent
attack
of
nausea
.
After
it
had
passed
,
he
rode
on
*NL*
again
,
but
he
could
think
of
nothing
except
his
physical
weakness
*NL*
and
his
desire
to
be
comforted
by
his
wife
.
He
wanted
to
get
into
*NL*
his
own
bed
.
Had
his
wife
been
at
home
,
he
would
have
turned
and
*NL*
gone
back
to
her
meekly
enough
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*

VIII
*NL*
*NL*
When
old
Ivar
climbed
down
from
his
loft
at
four
o'clock
the
next
*NL*
morning
,
he
came
upon
Emil
's
mare
,
jaded
and
lather-stained
,
her
*NL*
bridle
broken
,
chewing
the
scattered
tufts
of
hay
outside
the
stable
*NL*
door
.
The
old
man
was
thrown
into
a
fright
at
once
.
He
put
the
*NL*
mare
in
her
stall
,
threw
her
a
measure
of
oats
,
and
then
set
out
*NL*
as
fast
as
his
bow-legs
could
carry
him
on
the
path
to
the
nearest
*NL*
neighbor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Something
is
wrong
with
that
boy
.
Some
misfortune
has
come
upon
*NL*
us
.
He
would
never
have
used
her
so
,
in
his
right
senses
.
It
is
*NL*
not
his
way
to
abuse
his
mare
,
''
the
old
man
kept
muttering
,
as
he
*NL*
scuttled
through
the
short
,
wet
pasture
grass
on
his
bare
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
Ivar
was
hurrying
across
the
fields
,
the
first
long
rays
of
*NL*
the
sun
were
reaching
down
between
the
orchard
boughs
to
those
two
*NL*
dew-drenched
figures
.
The
story
of
what
had
happened
was
written
*NL*
plainly
on
the
orchard
grass
,
and
on
the
white
mulberries
that
had
*NL*
fallen
in
the
night
and
were
covered
with
dark
stain
.
For
Emil
the
*NL*
chapter
had
been
short
.
He
was
shot
in
the
heart
,
and
had
rolled
*NL*
over
on
his
back
and
died
.
His
face
was
turned
up
to
the
sky
and
*NL*
his
brows
were
drawn
in
a
frown
,
as
if
he
had
realized
that
something
*NL*
had
befallen
him
.
But
for
Marie
Shabata
it
had
not
been
so
easy
.
*NL*
One
ball
had
torn
through
her
right
lung
,
another
had
shattered
*NL*
the
carotid
artery
.
She
must
have
started
up
and
gone
toward
the
*NL*
hedge
,
leaving
a
trail
of
blood
.
There
she
had
fallen
and
bled
.
*NL*
From
that
spot
there
was
another
trail
,
heavier
than
the
first
,
*NL*
where
she
must
have
dragged
herself
back
to
Emil
's
body
.
Once
*NL*
there
,
she
seemed
not
to
have
struggled
any
more
.
She
had
lifted
*NL*
her
head
to
her
lover
's
breast
,
taken
his
hand
in
both
her
own
,
*NL*
and
bled
quietly
to
death
.
She
was
lying
on
her
right
side
in
an
*NL*
easy
and
natural
position
,
her
cheek
on
Emil
's
shoulder
.
On
her
*NL*
face
there
was
a
look
of
ineffable
content
.
Her
lips
were
parted
*NL*
a
little
;
her
eyes
were
lightly
closed
,
as
if
in
a
day-dream
or
a
*NL*
light
slumber
.
After
she
lay
down
there
,
she
seemed
not
to
have
*NL*
moved
an
eyelash
.
The
hand
she
held
was
covered
with
dark
stains
,
*NL*
where
she
had
kissed
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
stained
,
slippery
grass
,
the
darkened
mulberries
,
told
only
*NL*
half
the
story
.
Above
Marie
and
Emil
,
two
white
butterflies
from
*NL*
Frank
's
alfalfa-field
were
fluttering
in
and
out
among
the
interlacing
*NL*
shadows
;
diving
and
soaring
,
now
close
together
,
now
far
apart
;
*NL*
and
in
the
long
grass
by
the
fence
the
last
wild
roses
of
the
year
*NL*
opened
their
pink
hearts
to
die
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Ivar
reached
the
path
by
the
hedge
,
he
saw
Shabata
's
rifle
*NL*
lying
in
the
way
.
He
turned
and
peered
through
the
branches
,
*NL*
falling
upon
his
knees
as
if
his
legs
had
been
mowed
from
under
*NL*
him
.
``
Merciful
God
!
''
he
groaned
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alexandra
,
too
,
had
risen
early
that
morning
,
because
of
her
anxiety
*NL*
about
Emil
.
She
was
in
Emil
's
room
upstairs
when
,
from
the
window
,
*NL*
she
saw
Ivar
coming
along
the
path
that
led
from
the
Shabatas
'
.
*NL*
He
was
running
like
a
spent
man
,
tottering
and
lurching
from
side
*NL*
to
side
.
Ivar
never
drank
,
and
Alexandra
thought
at
once
that
one
*NL*
of
his
spells
had
come
upon
him
,
and
that
he
must
be
in
a
very
bad
*NL*
way
indeed
.
She
ran
downstairs
and
hurried
out
to
meet
him
,
to
*NL*
hide
his
infirmity
from
the
eyes
of
her
household
.
The
old
man
*NL*
fell
in
the
road
at
her
feet
and
caught
her
hand
,
over
which
he
*NL*
bowed
his
shaggy
head
.
``
Mistress
,
mistress

he
sobbed
,
``
it
has
*NL*
fallen

Sin
and
death
for
the

have
mercy
upon

PART
V.
Alexandra
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
*NL*
*NL*
Ivar
was
sitting
at
a
cobbler
's
bench
in
the
barn
,
mending
harness
*NL*
by
the
light
of
a
lantern
and
repeating
to
himself
the
101st
Psalm
.
*NL*
It
was
only
five
o'clock
of
a
mid-October
day
,
but
a
storm
had
*NL*
come
up
in
the
afternoon
,
bringing
black
clouds
,
a
cold
wind
and
*NL*
torrents
of
rain
.
The
old
man
wore
his
buffalo-skin
coat
,
and
*NL*
occasionally
stopped
to
warm
his
fingers
at
the
lantern
.
Suddenly
*NL*
a
woman
burst
into
the
shed
,
as
if
she
had
been
blown
in
,
accompanied
by
*NL*
a
shower
of
rain-drops
.
It
was
Signa
,
wrapped
in
a
man
's
overcoat
*NL*
and
wearing
a
pair
of
boots
over
her
shoes
.
In
time
of
trouble
*NL*
Signa
had
come
back
to
stay
with
her
mistress
,
for
she
was
the
only
*NL*
one
of
the
maids
from
whom
Alexandra
would
accept
much
personal
*NL*
service
.
It
was
three
months
now
since
the
news
of
the
terrible
*NL*
thing
that
had
happened
in
Frank
Shabata
's
orchard
had
first
run
*NL*
like
a
fire
over
the
Divide
.
Signa
and
Nelse
were
staying
on
with
*NL*
Alexandra
until
winter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ivar
,
''
Signa
exclaimed
as
she
wiped
the
rain
from
her
face
,
``
do
*NL*
you
know
where
she
is
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
man
put
down
his
cobbler
's
knife
.
``
Who
,
the
mistress
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
She
went
away
about
three
o'clock
.
I
happened
to
look
out
*NL*
of
the
window
and
saw
her
going
across
the
fields
in
her
thin
dress
*NL*
and
sun-hat
.
And
now
this
storm
has
come
on
.
I
thought
she
was
*NL*
going
to
Mrs.
Hiller
's
,
and
I
telephoned
as
soon
as
the
thunder
*NL*
stopped
,
but
she
had
not
been
there
.
I
'm
afraid
she
is
out
somewhere
*NL*
and
will
get
her
death
of
cold
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ivar
put
on
his
cap
and
took
up
the
lantern
.
``
JA
,
JA
,
we
will
see
.
*NL*
I
will
hitch
the
boy
's
mare
to
the
cart
and
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Signa
followed
him
across
the
wagon-shed
to
the
horses
'
stable
.
*NL*
She
was
shivering
with
cold
and
excitement
.
``
Where
do
you
suppose
*NL*
she
can
be
,
Ivar
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
man
lifted
a
set
of
single
harness
carefully
from
its
peg
.
*NL*
``
How
should
I
know
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
think
she
is
at
the
graveyard
,
do
n't
you
?
''
Signa
persisted
.
*NL*
``
So
do
I.
Oh
,
I
wish
she
would
be
more
like
herself
!
I
ca
n't
*NL*
believe
it
's
Alexandra
Bergson
come
to
this
,
with
no
head
about
*NL*
anything
.
I
have
to
tell
her
when
to
eat
and
when
to
go
to
bed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Patience
,
patience
,
sister
,
''
muttered
Ivar
as
he
settled
the
bit
*NL*
in
the
horse
's
mouth
.
``
When
the
eyes
of
the
flesh
are
shut
,
the
*NL*
eyes
of
the
spirit
are
open
.
She
will
have
a
message
from
those
*NL*
who
are
gone
,
and
that
will
bring
her
peace
.
Until
then
we
must
*NL*
bear
with
her
.
You
and
I
are
the
only
ones
who
have
weight
with
*NL*
her
.
She
trusts
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
awful
it
's
been
these
last
three
months
.
''
Signa
held
the
*NL*
lantern
so
that
he
could
see
to
buckle
the
straps
.
``
It
do
n't
seem
*NL*
right
that
we
must
all
be
so
miserable
.
Why
do
we
all
have
to
be
*NL*
punished
?
Seems
to
me
like
good
times
would
never
come
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ivar
expressed
himself
in
a
deep
sigh
,
but
said
nothing
.
He
stooped
*NL*
and
took
a
sandburr
from
his
toe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ivar
,
''
Signa
asked
suddenly
,
``
will
you
tell
me
why
you
go
barefoot
?
*NL*
All
the
time
I
lived
here
in
the
house
I
wanted
to
ask
you
.
Is
it
*NL*
for
a
penance
,
or
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sister
.
It
is
for
the
indulgence
of
the
body
.
From
my
youth
*NL*
up
I
have
had
a
strong
,
rebellious
body
,
and
have
been
subject
to
*NL*
every
kind
of
temptation
.
Even
in
age
my
temptations
are
prolonged
.
*NL*
It
was
necessary
to
make
some
allowances
;
and
the
feet
,
as
I
*NL*
understand
it
,
are
free
members
.
There
is
no
divine
prohibition
*NL*
for
them
in
the
Ten
Commandments
.
The
hands
,
the
tongue
,
the
eyes
,
*NL*
the
heart
,
all
the
bodily
desires
we
are
commanded
to
subdue
;
but
*NL*
the
feet
are
free
members
.
I
indulge
them
without
harm
to
any
*NL*
one
,
even
to
trampling
in
filth
when
my
desires
are
low
.
They
are
*NL*
quickly
cleaned
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Signa
did
not
laugh
.
She
looked
thoughtful
as
she
followed
Ivar
out
*NL*
to
the
wagon-shed
and
held
the
shafts
up
for
him
,
while
he
backed
*NL*
in
the
mare
and
buckled
the
hold-backs
.
``
You
have
been
a
good
*NL*
friend
to
the
mistress
,
Ivar
,
''
she
murmured
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
,
God
be
with
you
,
''
replied
Ivar
as
he
clambered
into
the
*NL*
cart
and
put
the
lantern
under
the
oilcloth
lap-cover
.
``
Now
for
*NL*
a
ducking
,
my
girl
,
''
he
said
to
the
mare
,
gathering
up
the
reins
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
emerged
from
the
shed
,
a
stream
of
water
,
running
off
the
*NL*
thatch
,
struck
the
mare
on
the
neck
.
She
tossed
her
head
indignantly
,
*NL*
then
struck
out
bravely
on
the
soft
ground
,
slipping
back
again
and
*NL*
again
as
she
climbed
the
hill
to
the
main
road
.
Between
the
rain
*NL*
and
the
darkness
Ivar
could
see
very
little
,
so
he
let
Emil
's
mare
*NL*
have
the
rein
,
keeping
her
head
in
the
right
direction
.
When
the
*NL*
ground
was
level
,
he
turned
her
out
of
the
dirt
road
upon
the
sod
,
*NL*
where
she
was
able
to
trot
without
slipping
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
Ivar
reached
the
graveyard
,
three
miles
from
the
house
,
*NL*
the
storm
had
spent
itself
,
and
the
downpour
had
died
into
a
soft
,
*NL*
dripping
rain
.
The
sky
and
the
land
were
a
dark
smoke
color
,
and
*NL*
seemed
to
be
coming
together
,
like
two
waves
.
When
Ivar
stopped
*NL*
at
the
gate
and
swung
out
his
lantern
,
a
white
figure
rose
from
*NL*
beside
John
Bergson
's
white
stone
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
man
sprang
to
the
ground
and
shuffled
toward
the
gate
*NL*
calling
,
``
Mistress
,
mistress
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alexandra
hurried
to
meet
him
and
put
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
.
*NL*
``
TYST
!
Ivar
.
There
's
nothing
to
be
worried
about
.
I
'm
sorry
if
*NL*
I
've
scared
you
all
.
I
did
n't
notice
the
storm
till
it
was
on
me
,
*NL*
and
I
could
n't
walk
against
it
.
I
'm
glad
you
've
come
.
I
am
so
*NL*
tired
I
did
n't
know
how
I
'd
ever
get
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ivar
swung
the
lantern
up
so
that
it
shone
in
her
face
.
``
GUD
!
*NL*
You
are
enough
to
frighten
us
,
mistress
.
You
look
like
a
drowned
*NL*
woman
.
How
could
you
do
such
a
thing
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Groaning
and
mumbling
he
led
her
out
of
the
gate
and
helped
her
*NL*
into
the
cart
,
wrapping
her
in
the
dry
blankets
on
which
he
had
*NL*
been
sitting
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alexandra
smiled
at
his
solicitude
.
``
Not
much
use
in
that
,
Ivar
.
*NL*
You
will
only
shut
the
wet
in
.
I
do
n't
feel
so
cold
now
;
but
I
'm
*NL*
heavy
and
numb
.
I
'm
glad
you
came
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ivar
turned
the
mare
and
urged
her
into
a
sliding
trot
.
Her
feet
*NL*
sent
back
a
continual
spatter
of
mud
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alexandra
spoke
to
the
old
man
as
they
jogged
along
through
the
*NL*
sullen
gray
twilight
of
the
storm
.
``
Ivar
,
I
think
it
has
done
me
*NL*
good
to
get
cold
clear
through
like
this
,
once
.
I
do
n't
believe
*NL*
I
shall
suffer
so
much
any
more
.
When
you
get
so
near
the
dead
,
*NL*
they
seem
more
real
than
the
living
.
Worldly
thoughts
leave
one
.
*NL*
Ever
since
Emil
died
,
I
've
suffered
so
when
it
rained
.
Now
that
*NL*
I
've
been
out
in
it
with
him
,
I
sha
n't
dread
it
.
After
you
once
*NL*
get
cold
clear
through
,
the
feeling
of
the
rain
on
you
is
sweet
.
*NL*
It
seems
to
bring
back
feelings
you
had
when
you
were
a
baby
.
It
*NL*
carries
you
back
into
the
dark
,
before
you
were
born
;
you
ca
n't
*NL*
see
things
,
but
they
come
to
you
,
somehow
,
and
you
know
them
and
*NL*
are
n't
afraid
of
them
.
Maybe
it
's
like
that
with
the
dead
.
If
*NL*
they
feel
anything
at
all
,
it
's
the
old
things
,
before
they
were
*NL*
born
,
that
comfort
people
like
the
feeling
of
their
own
bed
does
*NL*
when
they
are
little
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mistress
,
''
said
Ivar
reproachfully
,
``
those
are
bad
thoughts
.
The
*NL*
dead
are
in
Paradise
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
hung
his
head
,
for
he
did
not
believe
that
Emil
was
in
*NL*
Paradise
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
got
home
,
Signa
had
a
fire
burning
in
the
sitting-room
*NL*
stove
.
She
undressed
Alexandra
and
gave
her
a
hot
footbath
,
while
*NL*
Ivar
made
ginger
tea
in
the
kitchen
.
When
Alexandra
was
in
bed
,
*NL*
wrapped
in
hot
blankets
,
Ivar
came
in
with
his
tea
and
saw
that
*NL*
she
drank
it
.
Signa
asked
permission
to
sleep
on
the
slat
lounge
*NL*
outside
her
door
.
Alexandra
endured
their
attentions
patiently
,
*NL*
but
she
was
glad
when
they
put
out
the
lamp
and
left
her
.
As
she
*NL*
lay
alone
in
the
dark
,
it
occurred
to
her
for
the
first
time
that
*NL*
perhaps
she
was
actually
tired
of
life
.
All
the
physical
operations
*NL*
of
life
seemed
difficult
and
painful
.
She
longed
to
be
free
from
*NL*
her
own
body
,
which
ached
and
was
so
heavy
.
And
longing
itself
*NL*
was
heavy
:
she
yearned
to
be
free
of
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
lay
with
her
eyes
closed
,
she
had
again
,
more
vividly
than
*NL*
for
many
years
,
the
old
illusion
of
her
girlhood
,
of
being
lifted
*NL*
and
carried
lightly
by
some
one
very
strong
.
He
was
with
her
*NL*
a
long
while
this
time
,
and
carried
her
very
far
,
and
in
his
arms
*NL*
she
felt
free
from
pain
.
When
he
laid
her
down
on
her
bed
again
,
*NL*
she
opened
her
eyes
,
and
,
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
,
she
saw
*NL*
him
,
saw
him
clearly
,
though
the
room
was
dark
,
and
his
face
was
*NL*
covered
.
He
was
standing
in
the
doorway
of
her
room
.
His
white
*NL*
cloak
was
thrown
over
his
face
,
and
his
head
was
bent
a
little
*NL*
forward
.
His
shoulders
seemed
as
strong
as
the
foundations
of
the
*NL*
world
.
His
right
arm
,
bared
from
the
elbow
,
was
dark
and
gleaming
,
*NL*
like
bronze
,
and
she
knew
at
once
that
it
was
the
arm
of
the
*NL*
mightiest
of
all
lovers
.
She
knew
at
last
for
whom
it
was
she
had
*NL*
waited
,
and
where
he
would
carry
her
.
That
,
she
told
herself
,
was
*NL*
very
well
.
Then
she
went
to
sleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alexandra
wakened
in
the
morning
with
nothing
worse
than
a
hard
cold
*NL*
and
a
stiff
shoulder
.
She
kept
her
bed
for
several
days
,
and
it
*NL*
was
during
that
time
that
she
formed
a
resolution
to
go
to
Lincoln
*NL*
to
see
Frank
Shabata
.
Ever
since
she
last
saw
him
in
the
courtroom
,
*NL*
Frank
's
haggard
face
and
wild
eyes
had
haunted
her
.
The
trial
had
*NL*
lasted
only
three
days
.
Frank
had
given
himself
up
to
the
police
*NL*
in
Omaha
and
pleaded
guilty
of
killing
without
malice
and
without
*NL*
premeditation
.
The
gun
was
,
of
course
,
against
him
,
and
the
judge
*NL*
had
given
him
the
full
sentence
,
--
ten
years
.
He
had
now
been
in
*NL*
the
State
Penitentiary
for
a
month
.
*NL*
*NL*
Frank
was
the
only
one
,
Alexandra
told
herself
,
for
whom
anything
*NL*
could
be
done
.
He
had
been
less
in
the
wrong
than
any
of
them
,
*NL*
and
he
was
paying
the
heaviest
penalty
.
She
often
felt
that
she
*NL*
herself
had
been
more
to
blame
than
poor
Frank
.
From
the
time
the
*NL*
Shabatas
had
first
moved
to
the
neighboring
farm
,
she
had
omitted
*NL*
no
opportunity
of
throwing
Marie
and
Emil
together
.
Because
she
*NL*
knew
Frank
was
surly
about
doing
little
things
to
help
his
wife
,
*NL*
she
was
always
sending
Emil
over
to
spade
or
plant
or
carpenter
*NL*
for
Marie
.
She
was
glad
to
have
Emil
see
as
much
as
possible
of
an
*NL*
intelligent
,
city-bred
girl
like
their
neighbor
;
she
noticed
that
*NL*
it
improved
his
manners
.
She
knew
that
Emil
was
fond
of
Marie
,
but
*NL*
it
had
never
occurred
to
her
that
Emil
's
feeling
might
be
different
*NL*
from
her
own
.
She
wondered
at
herself
now
,
but
she
had
never
*NL*
thought
of
danger
in
that
direction
.
If
Marie
had
been
unmarried
,
--
oh
,
*NL*
yes
!
Then
she
would
have
kept
her
eyes
open
.
But
the
mere
fact
that
*NL*
she
was
Shabata
's
wife
,
for
Alexandra
,
settled
everything
.
That
she
was
*NL*
beautiful
,
impulsive
,
barely
two
years
older
than
Emil
,
these
facts
had
*NL*
had
no
weight
with
Alexandra
.
Emil
was
a
good
boy
,
and
only
bad
boys
*NL*
ran
after
married
women
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
Alexandra
could
in
a
measure
realize
that
Marie
was
,
after
*NL*
all
,
Marie
;
not
merely
a
``
married
woman
.
''
Sometimes
,
when
Alexandra
*NL*
thought
of
her
,
it
was
with
an
aching
tenderness
.
The
moment
she
*NL*
had
reached
them
in
the
orchard
that
morning
,
everything
was
clear
*NL*
to
her
.
There
was
something
about
those
two
lying
in
the
grass
,
*NL*
something
in
the
way
Marie
had
settled
her
cheek
on
Emil
's
shoulder
,
*NL*
that
told
her
everything
.
She
wondered
then
how
they
could
have
*NL*
helped
loving
each
other
;
how
she
could
have
helped
knowing
that
*NL*
they
must
.
Emil
's
cold
,
frowning
face
,
the
girl
's
content
--
Alexandra
*NL*
had
felt
awe
of
them
,
even
in
the
first
shock
of
her
grief
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
idleness
of
those
days
in
bed
,
the
relaxation
of
body
which
*NL*
attended
them
,
enabled
Alexandra
to
think
more
calmly
than
she
had
*NL*
done
since
Emil
's
death
.
She
and
Frank
,
she
told
herself
,
were
left
*NL*
out
of
that
group
of
friends
who
had
been
overwhelmed
by
disaster
.
*NL*
She
must
certainly
see
Frank
Shabata
.
Even
in
the
courtroom
her
*NL*
heart
had
grieved
for
him
.
He
was
in
a
strange
country
,
he
had
no
*NL*
kinsmen
or
friends
,
and
in
a
moment
he
had
ruined
his
life
.
Being
*NL*
what
he
was
,
she
felt
,
Frank
could
not
have
acted
otherwise
.
She
*NL*
could
understand
his
behavior
more
easily
than
she
could
understand
*NL*
Marie
's
.
Yes
,
she
must
go
to
Lincoln
to
see
Frank
Shabata
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
day
after
Emil
's
funeral
,
Alexandra
had
written
to
Carl
Linstrum
;
*NL*
a
single
page
of
notepaper
,
a
bare
statement
of
what
had
happened
.
*NL*
She
was
not
a
woman
who
could
write
much
about
such
a
thing
,
and
*NL*
about
her
own
feelings
she
could
never
write
very
freely
.
She
knew
*NL*
that
Carl
was
away
from
post-offices
,
prospecting
somewhere
in
the
*NL*
interior
.
Before
he
started
he
had
written
her
where
he
expected
*NL*
to
go
,
but
her
ideas
about
Alaska
were
vague
.
As
the
weeks
went
*NL*
by
and
she
heard
nothing
from
him
,
it
seemed
to
Alexandra
that
*NL*
her
heart
grew
hard
against
Carl
.
She
began
to
wonder
whether
she
*NL*
would
not
do
better
to
finish
her
life
alone
.
What
was
left
of
*NL*
life
seemed
unimportant
.

II
*NL*
*NL*
Late
in
the
afternoon
of
a
brilliant
October
day
,
Alexandra
Bergson
,
*NL*
dressed
in
a
black
suit
and
traveling-hat
,
alighted
at
the
Burlington
*NL*
depot
in
Lincoln
.
She
drove
to
the
Lindell
Hotel
,
where
she
had
*NL*
stayed
two
years
ago
when
she
came
up
for
Emil
's
Commencement
.
In
*NL*
spite
of
her
usual
air
of
sureness
and
self-possession
,
Alexandra
*NL*
felt
ill
at
ease
in
hotels
,
and
she
was
glad
,
when
she
went
to
the
*NL*
clerk
's
desk
to
register
,
that
there
were
not
many
people
in
the
*NL*
lobby
.
She
had
her
supper
early
,
wearing
her
hat
and
black
jacket
*NL*
down
to
the
dining-room
and
carrying
her
handbag
.
After
supper
*NL*
she
went
out
for
a
walk
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
growing
dark
when
she
reached
the
university
campus
.
She
*NL*
did
not
go
into
the
grounds
,
but
walked
slowly
up
and
down
the
*NL*
stone
walk
outside
the
long
iron
fence
,
looking
through
at
the
young
*NL*
men
who
were
running
from
one
building
to
another
,
at
the
lights
*NL*
shining
from
the
armory
and
the
library
.
A
squad
of
cadets
were
*NL*
going
through
their
drill
behind
the
armory
,
and
the
commands
of
*NL*
their
young
officer
rang
out
at
regular
intervals
,
so
sharp
and
*NL*
quick
that
Alexandra
could
not
understand
them
.
Two
stalwart
girls
*NL*
came
down
the
library
steps
and
out
through
one
of
the
iron
gates
.
*NL*
As
they
passed
her
,
Alexandra
was
pleased
to
hear
them
speaking
*NL*
Bohemian
to
each
other
.
Every
few
moments
a
boy
would
come
running
*NL*
down
the
flagged
walk
and
dash
out
into
the
street
as
if
he
were
*NL*
rushing
to
announce
some
wonder
to
the
world
.
Alexandra
felt
a
*NL*
great
tenderness
for
them
all
.
She
wished
one
of
them
would
stop
*NL*
and
speak
to
her
.
She
wished
she
could
ask
them
whether
they
had
*NL*
known
Emil
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
lingered
by
the
south
gate
she
actually
did
encounter
one
*NL*
of
the
boys
.
He
had
on
his
drill
cap
and
was
swinging
his
books
*NL*
at
the
end
of
a
long
strap
.
It
was
dark
by
this
time
;
he
did
not
*NL*
see
her
and
ran
against
her
.
He
snatched
off
his
cap
and
stood
*NL*
bareheaded
and
panting
.
``
I
'm
awfully
sorry
,
''
he
said
in
a
bright
,
*NL*
clear
voice
,
with
a
rising
inflection
,
as
if
he
expected
her
to
*NL*
say
something
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it
was
my
fault
!
''
said
Alexandra
eagerly
.
``
Are
you
an
old
*NL*
student
here
,
may
I
ask
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
ma'am
.
I
'm
a
Freshie
,
just
off
the
farm
.
Cherry
County
.
*NL*
Were
you
hunting
somebody
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
thank
you
.
That
is
--
''
Alexandra
wanted
to
detain
him
.
``
That
*NL*
is
,
I
would
like
to
find
some
of
my
brother
's
friends
.
He
graduated
*NL*
two
years
ago
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
'd
have
to
try
the
Seniors
,
would
n't
you
?
Let
's
see
;
I
*NL*
do
n't
know
any
of
them
yet
,
but
there
'll
be
sure
to
be
some
of
them
*NL*
around
the
library
.
That
red
building
,
right
there
,
''
he
pointed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
I
'll
try
there
,
''
said
Alexandra
lingeringly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
that
's
all
right
!
Good-night
.
''
The
lad
clapped
his
cap
on
*NL*
his
head
and
ran
straight
down
Eleventh
Street
.
Alexandra
looked
*NL*
after
him
wistfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
walked
back
to
her
hotel
unreasonably
comforted
.
``
What
a
nice
*NL*
voice
that
boy
had
,
and
how
polite
he
was
.
I
know
Emil
was
always
*NL*
like
that
to
women
.
''
And
again
,
after
she
had
undressed
and
was
*NL*
standing
in
her
nightgown
,
brushing
her
long
,
heavy
hair
by
the
*NL*
electric
light
,
she
remembered
him
and
said
to
herself
,
``
I
do
n't
*NL*
think
I
ever
heard
a
nicer
voice
than
that
boy
had
.
I
hope
he
*NL*
will
get
on
well
here
.
Cherry
County
;
that
's
where
the
hay
is
so
*NL*
fine
,
and
the
coyotes
can
scratch
down
to
water
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
nine
o'clock
the
next
morning
Alexandra
presented
herself
*NL*
at
the
warden
's
office
in
the
State
Penitentiary
.
The
warden
was
*NL*
a
German
,
a
ruddy
,
cheerful-looking
man
who
had
formerly
been
a
*NL*
harness-maker
.
Alexandra
had
a
letter
to
him
from
the
German
banker
*NL*
in
Hanover
.
As
he
glanced
at
the
letter
,
Mr.
Schwartz
put
away
*NL*
his
pipe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
big
Bohemian
,
is
it
?
Sure
,
he
's
gettin
'
along
fine
,
''
said
*NL*
Mr.
Schwartz
cheerfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
glad
to
hear
that
.
I
was
afraid
he
might
be
quarrelsome
and
*NL*
get
himself
into
more
trouble
.
Mr.
Schwartz
,
if
you
have
time
,
I
*NL*
would
like
to
tell
you
a
little
about
Frank
Shabata
,
and
why
I
am
*NL*
interested
in
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
warden
listened
genially
while
she
told
him
briefly
something
*NL*
of
Frank
's
history
and
character
,
but
he
did
not
seem
to
find
*NL*
anything
unusual
in
her
account
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sure
,
I
'll
keep
an
eye
on
him
.
We
'll
take
care
of
him
all
right
,
''
*NL*
he
said
,
rising
.
``
You
can
talk
to
him
here
,
while
I
go
to
see
to
*NL*
things
in
the
kitchen
.
I
'll
have
him
sent
in
.
He
ought
to
be
done
*NL*
washing
out
his
cell
by
this
time
.
We
have
to
keep
'em
clean
,
you
*NL*
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
warden
paused
at
the
door
,
speaking
back
over
his
shoulder
to
*NL*
a
pale
young
man
in
convicts
'
clothes
who
was
seated
at
a
desk
in
*NL*
the
corner
,
writing
in
a
big
ledger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bertie
,
when
1037
is
brought
in
,
you
just
step
out
and
give
this
*NL*
lady
a
chance
to
talk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
bowed
his
head
and
bent
over
his
ledger
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Mr.
Schwartz
disappeared
,
Alexandra
thrust
her
black-edged
*NL*
handkerchief
nervously
into
her
handbag
.
Coming
out
on
the
streetcar
*NL*
she
had
not
had
the
least
dread
of
meeting
Frank
.
But
since
she
*NL*
had
been
here
the
sounds
and
smells
in
the
corridor
,
the
look
of
the
*NL*
men
in
convicts
'
clothes
who
passed
the
glass
door
of
the
warden
's
*NL*
office
,
affected
her
unpleasantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
warden
's
clock
ticked
,
the
young
convict
's
pen
scratched
*NL*
busily
in
the
big
book
,
and
his
sharp
shoulders
were
shaken
every
*NL*
few
seconds
by
a
loose
cough
which
he
tried
to
smother
.
It
was
easy
*NL*
to
see
that
he
was
a
sick
man
.
Alexandra
looked
at
him
timidly
,
*NL*
but
he
did
not
once
raise
his
eyes
.
He
wore
a
white
shirt
under
*NL*
his
striped
jacket
,
a
high
collar
,
and
a
necktie
,
very
carefully
*NL*
tied
.
His
hands
were
thin
and
white
and
well
cared
for
,
and
he
had
*NL*
a
seal
ring
on
his
little
finger
.
When
he
heard
steps
approaching
*NL*
in
the
corridor
,
he
rose
,
blotted
his
book
,
put
his
pen
in
the
rack
,
*NL*
and
left
the
room
without
raising
his
eyes
.
Through
the
door
he
*NL*
opened
a
guard
came
in
,
bringing
Frank
Shabata
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
the
lady
that
wanted
to
talk
to
1037
?
Here
he
is
.
Be
on
your
*NL*
good
behavior
,
now
.
He
can
set
down
,
lady
,
''
seeing
that
Alexandra
*NL*
remained
standing
.
``
Push
that
white
button
when
you
're
through
*NL*
with
him
,
and
I
'll
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
guard
went
out
and
Alexandra
and
Frank
were
left
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alexandra
tried
not
to
see
his
hideous
clothes
.
She
tried
to
look
*NL*
straight
into
his
face
,
which
she
could
scarcely
believe
was
his
.
*NL*
It
was
already
bleached
to
a
chalky
gray
.
His
lips
were
colorless
,
*NL*
his
fine
teeth
looked
yellowish
.
He
glanced
at
Alexandra
sullenly
,
*NL*
blinked
as
if
he
had
come
from
a
dark
place
,
and
one
eyebrow
twitched
*NL*
continually
.
She
felt
at
once
that
this
interview
was
a
terrible
*NL*
ordeal
to
him
.
His
shaved
head
,
showing
the
conformation
of
his
*NL*
skull
,
gave
him
a
criminal
look
which
he
had
not
had
during
the
*NL*
trial
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alexandra
held
out
her
hand
.
``
Frank
,
''
she
said
,
her
eyes
filling
*NL*
suddenly
,
``
I
hope
you
'll
let
me
be
friendly
with
you
.
I
understand
*NL*
how
you
did
it
.
I
do
n't
feel
hard
toward
you
.
They
were
more
to
*NL*
blame
than
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Frank
jerked
a
dirty
blue
handkerchief
from
his
trousers
pocket
.
*NL*
He
had
begun
to
cry
.
He
turned
away
from
Alexandra
.
``
I
never
*NL*
did
mean
to
do
not
`
ing
to
dat
woman
,
''
he
muttered
.
``
I
never
mean
*NL*
to
do
not
`
ing
to
dat
boy
.
I
ai
n't
had
not

ing
ag
`
in
'
dat
boy
.
I
*NL*
always
like
dat
boy
fine
.
An
'
then
I
find
him
--
''
He
stopped
.
The
*NL*
feeling
went
out
of
his
face
and
eyes
.
He
dropped
into
a
chair
*NL*
and
sat
looking
stolidly
at
the
floor
,
his
hands
hanging
loosely
*NL*
between
his
knees
,
the
handkerchief
lying
across
his
striped
leg
.
*NL*
He
seemed
to
have
stirred
up
in
his
mind
a
disgust
that
had
paralyzed
*NL*
his
faculties
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
n't
come
up
here
to
blame
you
,
Frank
.
I
think
they
were
*NL*
more
to
blame
than
you
.
''
Alexandra
,
too
,
felt
benumbed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Frank
looked
up
suddenly
and
stared
out
of
the
office
window
.
``
I
*NL*
guess
dat
place
all
go
to
hell
what
I
work
so
hard
on
,
''
he
said
*NL*
with
a
slow
,
bitter
smile
.
``
I
not
care
a
damn
.
''
He
stopped
and
*NL*
rubbed
the
palm
of
his
hand
over
the
light
bristles
on
his
head
*NL*
with
annoyance
.
``
I
no
can
t
`
ink
without
my
hair
,
''
he
complained
.
*NL*
``
I
forget
English
.
We
not
talk
here
,
except
swear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alexandra
was
bewildered
.
Frank
seemed
to
have
undergone
a
change
*NL*
of
personality
.
There
was
scarcely
anything
by
which
she
could
*NL*
recognize
her
handsome
Bohemian
neighbor
.
He
seemed
,
somehow
,
not
*NL*
altogether
human
.
She
did
not
know
what
to
say
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
not
feel
hard
to
me
,
Frank
?
''
she
asked
at
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
Frank
clenched
his
fist
and
broke
out
in
excitement
.
``
I
not
feel
*NL*
hard
at
no
woman
.
I
tell
you
I
not

me
something
awful

''
*NL*
He
struck
his
fist
down
on
the
warden
's
desk
so
hard
that
he
*NL*
afterward
stroked
it
absently
.
A
pale
pink
crept
over
his
neck
and
*NL*
face
.
``
Two

know

But

a

''
*NL*
*NL*
Frank
rubbed
his
head
and
stopped
suddenly
,
as
he
had
stopped
*NL*
before
.
Alexandra
felt
that
there
was
something
strange
in
the
way
*NL*
he
chilled
off
,
as
if
something
came
up
in
him
that
extinguished
*NL*
his
power
of
feeling
or
thinking
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Frank
,
''
she
said
kindly
.
``
I
know
you
never
meant
to
hurt
*NL*
Marie
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Frank
smiled
at
her
queerly
.
His
eyes
filled
slowly
with
tears
.
*NL*
``
You
know
,
I
most
forgit

She

Alexandra

''
*NL*
*NL*
Alexandra
remembered
the
little
yellow
cane
she
had
found
in
Frank
's
*NL*
clothes-closet
.
She
thought
of
how
he
had
come
to
this
country
a
*NL*
gay
young
fellow
,
so
attractive
that
the
prettiest
Bohemian
girl
*NL*
in
Omaha
had
run
away
with
him
.
It
seemed
unreasonable
that
life
*NL*
should
have
landed
him
in
such
a
place
as
this
.
She
blamed
Marie
*NL*
bitterly
.
And
why
,
with
her
happy
,
affectionate
nature
,
should
*NL*
she
have
brought
destruction
and
sorrow
to
all
who
had
loved
her
,
*NL*
even
to
poor
old
Joe
Tovesky
,
the
uncle
who
used
to
carry
her
about
*NL*
so
proudly
when
she
was
a
little
girl
?
That
was
the
strangest
thing
*NL*
of
all
.
Was
there
,
then
,
something
wrong
in
being
warm-hearted
*NL*
and
impulsive
like
that
?
Alexandra
hated
to
think
so
.
But
there
*NL*
was
Emil
,
in
the
Norwegian
graveyard
at
home
,
and
here
was
Frank
*NL*
Shabata
.
Alexandra
rose
and
took
him
by
the
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Frank
Shabata
,
I
am
never
going
to
stop
trying
until
I
get
you
*NL*
pardoned
.
I
'll
never
give
the
Governor
any
peace
.
I
know
I
can
*NL*
get
you
out
of
this
place
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Frank
looked
at
her
distrustfully
,
but
he
gathered
confidence
from
*NL*
her
face
.
``
Alexandra
,
''
he
said
earnestly
,
``
if
I
git
out-a
here
,
*NL*
I
not
trouble
dis
country
no
more
.
I
go
back
where
I
come
from
;
*NL*
see
my
mother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alexandra
tried
to
withdraw
her
hand
,
but
Frank
held
on
to
it
*NL*
nervously
.
He
put
out
his
finger
and
absently
touched
a
button
*NL*
on
her
black
jacket
.
``
Alexandra
,
''
he
said
in
a
low
tone
,
looking
*NL*
steadily
at
the
button
,
``
you
ain
'
t
`
ink
I
use
dat
girl
awful
bad
*NL*
before
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Frank
.
We
wo
n't
talk
about
that
,
''
Alexandra
said
,
pressing
*NL*
his
hand
.
``
I
ca
n't
help
Emil
now
,
so
I
'm
going
to
do
what
I
can
*NL*
for
you
.
You
know
I
do
n't
go
away
from
home
often
,
and
I
came
up
*NL*
here
on
purpose
to
tell
you
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
warden
at
the
glass
door
looked
in
inquiringly
.
Alexandra
*NL*
nodded
,
and
he
came
in
and
touched
the
white
button
on
his
desk
.
*NL*
The
guard
appeared
,
and
with
a
sinking
heart
Alexandra
saw
Frank
*NL*
led
away
down
the
corridor
.
After
a
few
words
with
Mr.
Schwartz
,
*NL*
she
left
the
prison
and
made
her
way
to
the
street-car
.
She
had
*NL*
refused
with
horror
the
warden
's
cordial
invitation
to
``
go
through
*NL*
the
institution
.
''
As
the
car
lurched
over
its
uneven
roadbed
,
back
*NL*
toward
Lincoln
,
Alexandra
thought
of
how
she
and
Frank
had
been
*NL*
wrecked
by
the
same
storm
and
of
how
,
although
she
could
come
out
*NL*
into
the
sunlight
,
she
had
not
much
more
left
in
her
life
than
*NL*
he
.
She
remembered
some
lines
from
a
poem
she
had
liked
in
her
*NL*
schooldays
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
Henceforth
the
world
will
only
be
*NL*
A
wider
prison-house
to
me
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
and
sighed
.
A
disgust
of
life
weighed
upon
her
heart
;
some
such
*NL*
feeling
as
had
twice
frozen
Frank
Shabata
's
features
while
they
*NL*
talked
together
.
She
wished
she
were
back
on
the
Divide
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Alexandra
entered
her
hotel
,
the
clerk
held
up
one
finger
*NL*
and
beckoned
to
her
.
As
she
approached
his
desk
,
he
handed
her
a
*NL*
telegram
.
Alexandra
took
the
yellow
envelope
and
looked
at
it
in
*NL*
perplexity
,
then
stepped
into
the
elevator
without
opening
it
.
As
*NL*
she
walked
down
the
corridor
toward
her
room
,
she
reflected
that
*NL*
she
was
,
in
a
manner
,
immune
from
evil
tidings
.
On
reaching
her
*NL*
room
she
locked
the
door
,
and
sitting
down
on
a
chair
by
the
dresser
,
*NL*
opened
the
telegram
.
It
was
from
Hanover
,
and
it
read
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
Arrived
Hanover
last
night
.
Shall
wait
here
until
you
come
.
*NL*
Please
hurry
.
CARL
LINSTRUM
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alexandra
put
her
head
down
on
the
dresser
and
burst
into
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
III
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
afternoon
Carl
and
Alexandra
were
walking
across
the
fields
*NL*
from
Mrs.
Hiller
's
.
Alexandra
had
left
Lincoln
after
midnight
,
*NL*
and
Carl
had
met
her
at
the
Hanover
station
early
in
the
morning
.
*NL*
After
they
reached
home
,
Alexandra
had
gone
over
to
Mrs.
Hiller
's
*NL*
to
leave
a
little
present
she
had
bought
for
her
in
the
city
.
They
*NL*
stayed
at
the
old
lady
's
door
but
a
moment
,
and
then
came
out
to
*NL*
spend
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
in
the
sunny
fields
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alexandra
had
taken
off
her
black
traveling
suit
and
put
on
*NL*
a
white
dress
;
partly
because
she
saw
that
her
black
clothes
made
*NL*
Carl
uncomfortable
and
partly
because
she
felt
oppressed
by
them
*NL*
herself
.
They
seemed
a
little
like
the
prison
where
she
had
worn
*NL*
them
yesterday
,
and
to
be
out
of
place
in
the
open
fields
.
Carl
*NL*
had
changed
very
little
.
His
cheeks
were
browner
and
fuller
.
He
*NL*
looked
less
like
a
tired
scholar
than
when
he
went
away
a
year
ago
,
*NL*
but
no
one
,
even
now
,
would
have
taken
him
for
a
man
of
business
.
*NL*
His
soft
,
lustrous
black
eyes
,
his
whimsical
smile
,
would
be
less
*NL*
against
him
in
the
Klondike
than
on
the
Divide
.
There
are
always
*NL*
dreamers
on
the
frontier
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carl
and
Alexandra
had
been
talking
since
morning
.
Her
letter
had
*NL*
never
reached
him
.
He
had
first
learned
of
her
misfortune
from
*NL*
a
San
Francisco
paper
,
four
weeks
old
,
which
he
had
picked
up
in
*NL*
a
saloon
,
and
which
contained
a
brief
account
of
Frank
Shabata
's
*NL*
trial
.
When
he
put
down
the
paper
,
he
had
already
made
up
his
*NL*
mind
that
he
could
reach
Alexandra
as
quickly
as
a
letter
could
;
*NL*
and
ever
since
he
had
been
on
the
way
;
day
and
night
,
by
the
fastest
*NL*
boats
and
trains
he
could
catch
.
His
steamer
had
been
held
back
*NL*
two
days
by
rough
weather
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
came
out
of
Mrs.
Hiller
's
garden
they
took
up
their
talk
*NL*
again
where
they
had
left
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
could
you
come
away
like
that
,
Carl
,
without
arranging
things
?
*NL*
Could
you
just
walk
off
and
leave
your
business
?
''
Alexandra
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carl
laughed
.
``
Prudent
Alexandra
!
You
see
,
my
dear
,
I
happen
to
*NL*
have
an
honest
partner
.
I
trust
him
with
everything
.
In
fact
,
*NL*
it
's
been
his
enterprise
from
the
beginning
,
you
know
.
I
'm
in
it
*NL*
only
because
he
took
me
in
.
I
'll
have
to
go
back
in
the
spring
.
*NL*
Perhaps
you
will
want
to
go
with
me
then
.
We
have
n't
turned
up
*NL*
millions
yet
,
but
we
've
got
a
start
that
's
worth
following
.
But
*NL*
this
winter
I
'd
like
to
spend
with
you
.
You
wo
n't
feel
that
we
*NL*
ought
to
wait
longer
,
on
Emil
's
account
,
will
you
,
Alexandra
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alexandra
shook
her
head
.
``
No
,
Carl
;
I
do
n't
feel
that
way
about
*NL*
it
.
And
surely
you
need
n't
mind
anything
Lou
and
Oscar
say
now
.
*NL*
They
are
much
angrier
with
me
about
Emil
,
now
,
than
about
you
.
*NL*
They
say
it
was
all
my
fault
.
That
I
ruined
him
by
sending
him
to
*NL*
college
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
do
n't
care
a
button
for
Lou
or
Oscar
.
The
moment
I
knew
*NL*
you
were
in
trouble
,
the
moment
I
thought
you
might
need
me
,
it
all
*NL*
looked
different
.
You
've
always
been
a
triumphant
kind
of
person
.
''
*NL*
Carl
hesitated
,
looking
sidewise
at
her
strong
,
full
figure
.
``
But
*NL*
you
do
need
me
now
,
Alexandra
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
put
her
hand
on
his
arm
.
``
I
needed
you
terribly
when
it
*NL*
happened
,
Carl
.
I
cried
for
you
at
night
.
Then
everything
seemed
*NL*
to
get
hard
inside
of
me
,
and
I
thought
perhaps
I
should
never
care
*NL*
for
you
again
.
But
when
I
got
your
telegram
yesterday
,
then
--
then
*NL*
it
was
just
as
it
used
to
be
.
You
are
all
I
have
in
the
world
,
*NL*
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carl
pressed
her
hand
in
silence
.
They
were
passing
the
Shabatas
'
*NL*
empty
house
now
,
but
they
avoided
the
orchard
path
and
took
one
*NL*
that
led
over
by
the
pasture
pond
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
you
understand
it
,
Carl
?
''
Alexandra
murmured
.
``
I
have
had
*NL*
nobody
but
Ivar
and
Signa
to
talk
to
.
Do
talk
to
me
.
Can
you
*NL*
understand
it
?
Could
you
have
believed
that
of
Marie
Tovesky
?
I
*NL*
would
have
been
cut
to
pieces
,
little
by
little
,
before
I
would
*NL*
have
betrayed
her
trust
in
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carl
looked
at
the
shining
spot
of
water
before
them
.
``
Maybe
she
*NL*
was
cut
to
pieces
,
too
,
Alexandra
.
I
am
sure
she
tried
hard
;
they
*NL*
both
did
.
That
was
why
Emil
went
to
Mexico
,
of
course
.
And
he
was
*NL*
going
away
again
,
you
tell
me
,
though
he
had
only
been
home
three
*NL*
weeks
.
You
remember
that
Sunday
when
I
went
with
Emil
up
to
*NL*
the
French
Church
fair
?
I
thought
that
day
there
was
some
kind
*NL*
of
feeling
,
something
unusual
,
between
them
.
I
meant
to
talk
to
*NL*
you
about
it
.
But
on
my
way
back
I
met
Lou
and
Oscar
and
got
so
*NL*
angry
that
I
forgot
everything
else
.
You
must
n't
be
hard
on
them
,
*NL*
Alexandra
.
Sit
down
here
by
the
pond
a
minute
.
I
want
to
tell
*NL*
you
something
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
sat
down
on
the
grass-tufted
bank
and
Carl
told
her
how
he
had
*NL*
seen
Emil
and
Marie
out
by
the
pond
that
morning
,
more
than
a
year
*NL*
ago
,
and
how
young
and
charming
and
full
of
grace
they
had
seemed
*NL*
to
him
.
``
It
happens
like
that
in
the
world
sometimes
,
Alexandra
,
''
*NL*
he
added
earnestly
.
``
I
've
seen
it
before
.
There
are
women
who
*NL*
spread
ruin
around
them
through
no
fault
of
theirs
,
just
by
being
*NL*
too
beautiful
,
too
full
of
life
and
love
.
They
ca
n't
help
it
.
*NL*
People
come
to
them
as
people
go
to
a
warm
fire
in
winter
.
I
used
*NL*
to
feel
that
in
her
when
she
was
a
little
girl
.
Do
you
remember
*NL*
how
all
the
Bohemians
crowded
round
her
in
the
store
that
day
,
when
*NL*
she
gave
Emil
her
candy
?
You
remember
those
yellow
sparks
in
her
*NL*
eyes
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alexandra
sighed
.
``
Yes
.
People
could
n't
help
loving
her
.
Poor
*NL*
Frank
does
,
even
now
,
I
think
;
though
he
's
got
himself
in
such
*NL*
a
tangle
that
for
a
long
time
his
love
has
been
bitterer
than
his
*NL*
hate
.
But
if
you
saw
there
was
anything
wrong
,
you
ought
to
have
*NL*
told
me
,
Carl
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carl
took
her
hand
and
smiled
patiently
.
``
My
dear
,
it
was
something
*NL*
one
felt
in
the
air
,
as
you
feel
the
spring
coming
,
or
a
storm
in
*NL*
summer
.
I
did
n't
SEE
anything
.
Simply
,
when
I
was
with
those
two
*NL*
young
things
,
I
felt
my
blood
go
quicker
,
I
felt
--
how
shall
I
say
*NL*
it
?
--
an
acceleration
of
life
.
After
I
got
away
,
it
was
all
too
*NL*
delicate
,
too
intangible
,
to
write
about
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alexandra
looked
at
him
mournfully
.
``
I
try
to
be
more
liberal
*NL*
about
such
things
than
I
used
to
be
.
I
try
to
realize
that
we
are
*NL*
not
all
made
alike
.
Only
,
why
could
n't
it
have
been
Raoul
Marcel
,
*NL*
or
Jan
Smirka
?
Why
did
it
have
to
be
my
boy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
he
was
the
best
there
was
,
I
suppose
.
They
were
both
the
*NL*
best
you
had
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
sun
was
dropping
low
in
the
west
when
the
two
friends
rose
and
*NL*
took
the
path
again
.
The
straw-stacks
were
throwing
long
shadows
,
*NL*
the
owls
were
flying
home
to
the
prairie-dog
town
.
When
they
came
*NL*
to
the
corner
where
the
pastures
joined
,
Alexandra
's
twelve
young
*NL*
colts
were
galloping
in
a
drove
over
the
brow
of
the
hill
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Carl
,
''
said
Alexandra
,
``
I
should
like
to
go
up
there
with
you
in
*NL*
the
spring
.
I
have
n't
been
on
the
water
since
we
crossed
the
ocean
,
*NL*
when
I
was
a
little
girl
.
After
we
first
came
out
here
I
used
*NL*
to
dream
sometimes
about
the
shipyard
where
father
worked
,
and
a
*NL*
little
sort
of
inlet
,
full
of
masts
.
''
Alexandra
paused
.
After
a
*NL*
moment
's
thought
she
said
,
``
But
you
would
never
ask
me
to
go
away
*NL*
for
good
,
would
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
not
,
my
dearest
.
I
think
I
know
how
you
feel
about
this
*NL*
country
as
well
as
you
do
yourself
.
''
Carl
took
her
hand
in
both
*NL*
his
own
and
pressed
it
tenderly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
still
feel
that
way
,
though
Emil
is
gone
.
When
I
was
on
*NL*
the
train
this
morning
,
and
we
got
near
Hanover
,
I
felt
something
*NL*
like
I
did
when
I
drove
back
with
Emil
from
the
river
that
time
,
*NL*
in
the
dry
year
.
I
was
glad
to
come
back
to
it
.
I
've
lived
here
*NL*
a
long
time
.
There
is
great
peace
here
,
Carl
,
and
freedom
...
*NL*
I
thought
when
I
came
out
of
that
prison
,
where
poor
Frank
is
,
*NL*
that
I
should
never
feel
free
again
.
But
I
do
,
here
.
''
Alexandra
*NL*
took
a
deep
breath
and
looked
off
into
the
red
west
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
belong
to
the
land
,
''
Carl
murmured
,
``
as
you
have
always
said
.
*NL*
Now
more
than
ever
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
now
more
than
ever
.
You
remember
what
you
once
said
about
*NL*
the
graveyard
,
and
the
old
story
writing
itself
over
?
Only
it
is
*NL*
we
who
write
it
,
with
the
best
we
have
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
paused
on
the
last
ridge
of
the
pasture
,
overlooking
the
*NL*
house
and
the
windmill
and
the
stables
that
marked
the
site
of
John
*NL*
Bergson
's
homestead
.
On
every
side
the
brown
waves
of
the
earth
*NL*
rolled
away
to
meet
the
sky
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lou
and
Oscar
ca
n't
see
those
things
,
''
said
Alexandra
suddenly
.
*NL*
``
Suppose
I
do
will
my
land
to
their
children
,
what
difference
will
*NL*
that
make
?
The
land
belongs
to
the
future
,
Carl
;
that
's
the
way
*NL*
it
seems
to
me
.
How
many
of
the
names
on
the
county
clerk
's
plat
*NL*
will
be
there
in
fifty
years
?
I
might
as
well
try
to
will
the
*NL*
sunset
over
there
to
my
brother
's
children
.
We
come
and
go
,
but
*NL*
the
land
is
always
here
.
And
the
people
who
love
it
and
understand
*NL*
it
are
the
people
who
own
it
--
for
a
little
while
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carl
looked
at
her
wonderingly
.
She
was
still
gazing
into
the
west
,
*NL*
and
in
her
face
there
was
that
exalted
serenity
that
sometimes
came
*NL*
to
her
at
moments
of
deep
feeling
.
The
level
rays
of
the
sinking
*NL*
sun
shone
in
her
clear
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
are
you
thinking
of
such
things
now
,
Alexandra
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
a
dream
before
I
went
to
Lincoln
--
But
I
will
tell
you
about
*NL*
that
afterward
,
after
we
are
married
.
It
will
never
come
true
,
*NL*
now
,
in
the
way
I
thought
it
might
.
''
She
took
Carl
's
arm
and
they
*NL*
walked
toward
the
gate
.
``
How
many
times
we
have
walked
this
path
*NL*
together
,
Carl
.
How
many
times
we
will
walk
it
again
!
Does
it
seem
*NL*
to
you
like
coming
back
to
your
own
place
?
Do
you
feel
at
peace
*NL*
with
the
world
here
?
I
think
we
shall
be
very
happy
.
I
have
n't
*NL*
any
fears
.
I
think
when
friends
marry
,
they
are
safe
.
We
do
n't
*NL*
suffer
like
--
those
young
ones
.
''
Alexandra
ended
with
a
sigh
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
reached
the
gate
.
Before
Carl
opened
it
,
he
drew
Alexandra
*NL*
to
him
and
kissed
her
softly
,
on
her
lips
and
on
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
leaned
heavily
on
his
shoulder
.
``
I
am
tired
,
''
she
murmured
.
*NL*
``
I
have
been
very
lonely
,
Carl
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
went
into
the
house
together
,
leaving
the
Divide
behind
them
,
*NL*
under
the
evening
star
.
Fortunate
country
,
that
is
one
day
to
*NL*
receive
hearts
like
Alexandra
's
into
its
bosom
,
to
give
them
out
*NL*
again
in
the
yellow
wheat
,
in
the
rustling
corn
,
in
the
shining
*NL*
eyes
of
youth
!
