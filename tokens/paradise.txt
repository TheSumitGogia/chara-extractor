CHAPTER
1
.
Amory
,
Son
of
Beatrice
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
Blaine
inherited
from
his
mother
every
trait
,
except
the
*NL*
stray
inexpressible
few
,
that
made
him
worth
while
.
His
father
,
an
*NL*
ineffectual
,
inarticulate
man
with
a
taste
for
Byron
and
a
habit
of
*NL*
drowsing
over
the
Encyclopedia
Britannica
,
grew
wealthy
at
thirty
*NL*
through
the
death
of
two
elder
brothers
,
successful
Chicago
brokers
,
and
*NL*
in
the
first
flush
of
feeling
that
the
world
was
his
,
went
to
Bar
Harbor
*NL*
and
met
Beatrice
O'Hara
.
In
consequence
,
Stephen
Blaine
handed
down
to
*NL*
posterity
his
height
of
just
under
six
feet
and
his
tendency
to
waver
at
*NL*
crucial
moments
,
these
two
abstractions
appearing
in
his
son
Amory
.
*NL*
For
many
years
he
hovered
in
the
background
of
his
family
's
life
,
an
*NL*
unassertive
figure
with
a
face
half-obliterated
by
lifeless
,
silky
hair
,
*NL*
continually
occupied
in
``
taking
care
''
of
his
wife
,
continually
harassed
*NL*
by
the
idea
that
he
did
n't
and
could
n't
understand
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Beatrice
Blaine
!
There
was
a
woman
!
Early
pictures
taken
on
her
*NL*
father
's
estate
at
Lake
Geneva
,
Wisconsin
,
or
in
Rome
at
the
Sacred
*NL*
Heart
Convent
--
an
educational
extravagance
that
in
her
youth
was
only
*NL*
for
the
daughters
of
the
exceptionally
wealthy
--
showed
the
exquisite
*NL*
delicacy
of
her
features
,
the
consummate
art
and
simplicity
of
her
*NL*
clothes
.
A
brilliant
education
she
had
--
her
youth
passed
in
renaissance
*NL*
glory
,
she
was
versed
in
the
latest
gossip
of
the
Older
Roman
Families
;
*NL*
known
by
name
as
a
fabulously
wealthy
American
girl
to
Cardinal
Vitori
*NL*
and
Queen
Margherita
and
more
subtle
celebrities
that
one
must
have
had
*NL*
some
culture
even
to
have
heard
of
.
She
learned
in
England
to
prefer
*NL*
whiskey
and
soda
to
wine
,
and
her
small
talk
was
broadened
in
two
senses
*NL*
during
a
winter
in
Vienna
.
All
in
all
Beatrice
O'Hara
absorbed
the
*NL*
sort
of
education
that
will
be
quite
impossible
ever
again
;
a
tutelage
*NL*
measured
by
the
number
of
things
and
people
one
could
be
contemptuous
of
*NL*
and
charming
about
;
a
culture
rich
in
all
arts
and
traditions
,
barren
of
*NL*
all
ideas
,
in
the
last
of
those
days
when
the
great
gardener
clipped
the
*NL*
inferior
roses
to
produce
one
perfect
bud
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
her
less
important
moments
she
returned
to
America
,
met
Stephen
*NL*
Blaine
and
married
him
--
this
almost
entirely
because
she
was
a
little
*NL*
bit
weary
,
a
little
bit
sad
.
Her
only
child
was
carried
through
*NL*
a
tiresome
season
and
brought
into
the
world
on
a
spring
day
in
*NL*
ninety-six
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Amory
was
five
he
was
already
a
delightful
companion
for
her
.
He
*NL*
was
an
auburn-haired
boy
,
with
great
,
handsome
eyes
which
he
would
grow
*NL*
up
to
in
time
,
a
facile
imaginative
mind
and
a
taste
for
fancy
dress
.
*NL*
From
his
fourth
to
his
tenth
year
he
did
the
country
with
his
mother
*NL*
in
her
father
's
private
car
,
from
Coronado
,
where
his
mother
became
so
*NL*
bored
that
she
had
a
nervous
breakdown
in
a
fashionable
hotel
,
down
to
*NL*
Mexico
City
,
where
she
took
a
mild
,
almost
epidemic
consumption
.
This
*NL*
trouble
pleased
her
,
and
later
she
made
use
of
it
as
an
intrinsic
part
*NL*
of
her
atmosphere
--
especially
after
several
astounding
bracers
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
,
while
more
or
less
fortunate
little
rich
boys
were
defying
*NL*
governesses
on
the
beach
at
Newport
,
or
being
spanked
or
tutored
or
read
*NL*
to
from
``
Do
and
Dare
,
''
or
``
Frank
on
the
Mississippi
,
''
Amory
was
biting
*NL*
acquiescent
bell-boys
in
the
Waldorf
,
outgrowing
a
natural
repugnance
*NL*
to
chamber
music
and
symphonies
,
and
deriving
a
highly
specialized
*NL*
education
from
his
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Amory
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Beatrice
.
''
-LRB-
Such
a
quaint
name
for
his
mother
;
she
encouraged
it
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
,
do
n't
_
think
_
of
getting
out
of
bed
yet
.
I
've
always
suspected
*NL*
that
early
rising
in
early
life
makes
one
nervous
.
Clothilde
is
having
*NL*
your
breakfast
brought
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
feeling
very
old
to-day
,
Amory
,
''
she
would
sigh
,
her
face
a
rare
*NL*
cameo
of
pathos
,
her
voice
exquisitely
modulated
,
her
hands
as
facile
*NL*
as
Bernhardt
's
.
``
My
nerves
are
on
edge
--
on
edge
.
We
must
leave
this
*NL*
terrifying
place
to-morrow
and
go
searching
for
sunshine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
's
penetrating
green
eyes
would
look
out
through
tangled
hair
at
*NL*
his
mother
.
Even
at
this
age
he
had
no
illusions
about
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Amory
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
_
yes
_
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
you
to
take
a
red-hot
bath
as
hot
as
you
can
bear
it
,
and
just
*NL*
relax
your
nerves
.
You
can
read
in
the
tub
if
you
wish
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
fed
him
sections
of
the
``
Fetes
Galantes
''
before
he
was
ten
;
at
*NL*
eleven
he
could
talk
glibly
,
if
rather
reminiscently
,
of
Brahms
and
*NL*
Mozart
and
Beethoven
.
One
afternoon
,
when
left
alone
in
the
hotel
at
*NL*
Hot
Springs
,
he
sampled
his
mother
's
apricot
cordial
,
and
as
the
taste
*NL*
pleased
him
,
he
became
quite
tipsy
.
This
was
fun
for
a
while
,
but
*NL*
he
essayed
a
cigarette
in
his
exaltation
,
and
succumbed
to
a
vulgar
,
*NL*
plebeian
reaction
.
Though
this
incident
horrified
Beatrice
,
it
also
*NL*
secretly
amused
her
and
became
part
of
what
in
a
later
generation
would
*NL*
have
been
termed
her
``
line
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
son
of
mine
,
''
he
heard
her
tell
a
room
full
of
awestruck
,
admiring
*NL*
women
one
day
,
``
is
entirely
sophisticated
and
quite
charming
--
but
*NL*
delicate
--
we
're
all
delicate
;
_
here
_
,
you
know
.
''
Her
hand
was
radiantly
*NL*
outlined
against
her
beautiful
bosom
;
then
sinking
her
voice
to
a
*NL*
whisper
,
she
told
them
of
the
apricot
cordial
.
They
rejoiced
,
for
she
*NL*
was
a
brave
raconteuse
,
but
many
were
the
keys
turned
in
sideboard
locks
*NL*
that
night
against
the
possible
defection
of
little
Bobby
or
Barbara
...
*NL*
*NL*
These
domestic
pilgrimages
were
invariably
in
state
;
two
maids
,
the
*NL*
private
car
,
or
Mr.
Blaine
when
available
,
and
very
often
a
physician
.
*NL*
When
Amory
had
the
whooping-cough
four
disgusted
specialists
glared
at
*NL*
each
other
hunched
around
his
bed
;
when
he
took
scarlet
fever
the
number
*NL*
of
attendants
,
including
physicians
and
nurses
,
totalled
fourteen
.
*NL*
However
,
blood
being
thicker
than
broth
,
he
was
pulled
through
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Blaines
were
attached
to
no
city
.
They
were
the
Blaines
of
Lake
*NL*
Geneva
;
they
had
quite
enough
relatives
to
serve
in
place
of
friends
,
*NL*
and
an
enviable
standing
from
Pasadena
to
Cape
Cod
.
But
Beatrice
grew
*NL*
more
and
more
prone
to
like
only
new
acquaintances
,
as
there
were
*NL*
certain
stories
,
such
as
the
history
of
her
constitution
and
its
many
*NL*
amendments
,
memories
of
her
years
abroad
,
that
it
was
necessary
for
*NL*
her
to
repeat
at
regular
intervals
.
Like
Freudian
dreams
,
they
must
be
*NL*
thrown
off
,
else
they
would
sweep
in
and
lay
siege
to
her
nerves
.
But
*NL*
Beatrice
was
critical
about
American
women
,
especially
the
floating
*NL*
population
of
ex-Westerners
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
have
accents
,
my
dear
,
''
she
told
Amory
,
``
not
Southern
accents
*NL*
or
Boston
accents
,
not
an
accent
attached
to
any
locality
,
just
an
*NL*
accent
''
--
she
became
dreamy
.
``
They
pick
up
old
,
moth-eaten
London
accents
*NL*
that
are
down
on
their
luck
and
have
to
be
used
by
some
one
.
They
talk
*NL*
as
an
English
butler
might
after
several
years
in
a
Chicago
grand-opera
*NL*
company
.
''
She
became
almost
incoherent
--
``
Suppose
--
time
in
every
Western
*NL*
woman
's
life
--
she
feels
her
husband
is
prosperous
enough
for
her
to
*NL*
have
--
accent
--
they
try
to
impress
_
me
_
,
my
dear
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Though
she
thought
of
her
body
as
a
mass
of
frailties
,
she
considered
*NL*
her
soul
quite
as
ill
,
and
therefore
important
in
her
life
.
She
had
*NL*
once
been
a
Catholic
,
but
discovering
that
priests
were
infinitely
more
*NL*
attentive
when
she
was
in
process
of
losing
or
regaining
faith
in
Mother
*NL*
Church
,
she
maintained
an
enchantingly
wavering
attitude
.
Often
she
*NL*
deplored
the
bourgeois
quality
of
the
American
Catholic
clergy
,
and
was
*NL*
quite
sure
that
had
she
lived
in
the
shadow
of
the
great
Continental
*NL*
cathedrals
her
soul
would
still
be
a
thin
flame
on
the
mighty
altar
of
*NL*
Rome
.
Still
,
next
to
doctors
,
priests
were
her
favorite
sport
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
Bishop
Wiston
,
''
she
would
declare
,
``
I
do
not
want
to
talk
of
*NL*
myself
.
I
can
imagine
the
stream
of
hysterical
women
fluttering
at
your
*NL*
doors
,
beseeching
you
to
be
simpatico
''
--
then
after
an
interlude
filled
*NL*
by
the
clergyman
--
``
but
my
mood
--
is
--
oddly
dissimilar
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Only
to
bishops
and
above
did
she
divulge
her
clerical
romance
.
When
she
*NL*
had
first
returned
to
her
country
there
had
been
a
pagan
,
Swinburnian
*NL*
young
man
in
Asheville
,
for
whose
passionate
kisses
and
unsentimental
*NL*
conversations
she
had
taken
a
decided
penchant
--
they
had
discussed
*NL*
the
matter
pro
and
con
with
an
intellectual
romancing
quite
devoid
of
*NL*
sappiness
.
Eventually
she
had
decided
to
marry
for
background
,
and
the
*NL*
young
pagan
from
Asheville
had
gone
through
a
spiritual
crisis
,
joined
*NL*
the
Catholic
Church
,
and
was
now
--
Monsignor
Darcy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
Mrs.
Blaine
,
he
is
still
delightful
company
--
quite
the
*NL*
cardinal
's
right-hand
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Amory
will
go
to
him
one
day
,
I
know
,
''
breathed
the
beautiful
lady
,
*NL*
``
and
Monsignor
Darcy
will
understand
him
as
he
understood
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
became
thirteen
,
rather
tall
and
slender
,
and
more
than
ever
on
to
*NL*
his
Celtic
mother
.
He
had
tutored
occasionally
--
the
idea
being
that
he
*NL*
was
to
``
keep
up
,
''
at
each
place
``
taking
up
the
work
where
he
left
off
,
''
*NL*
yet
as
no
tutor
ever
found
the
place
he
left
off
,
his
mind
was
still
in
*NL*
very
good
shape
.
What
a
few
more
years
of
this
life
would
have
made
of
*NL*
him
is
problematical
.
However
,
four
hours
out
from
land
,
Italy
bound
,
*NL*
with
Beatrice
,
his
appendix
burst
,
probably
from
too
many
meals
in
bed
,
*NL*
and
after
a
series
of
frantic
telegrams
to
Europe
and
America
,
to
the
*NL*
amazement
of
the
passengers
the
great
ship
slowly
wheeled
around
and
*NL*
returned
to
New
York
to
deposit
Amory
at
the
pier
.
You
will
admit
that
*NL*
if
it
was
not
life
it
was
magnificent
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
operation
Beatrice
had
a
nervous
breakdown
that
bore
a
*NL*
suspicious
resemblance
to
delirium
tremens
,
and
Amory
was
left
in
*NL*
Minneapolis
,
destined
to
spend
the
ensuing
two
years
with
his
aunt
and
*NL*
uncle
.
There
the
crude
,
vulgar
air
of
Western
civilization
first
catches
*NL*
him
--
in
his
underwear
,
so
to
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
*****
*NL*
*NL*
A
KISS
FOR
AMORY
*NL*
*NL*
His
lip
curled
when
he
read
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
going
to
have
a
bobbing
party
,
''
it
said
,
``
on
Thursday
,
*NL*
December
the
seventeenth
,
at
five
o'clock
,
and
I
would
like
it
*NL*
very
much
if
you
could
come
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yours
truly

*NL*
R.S.V.P.
Myra

*NL*
*NL*
He
had
been
two
months
in
Minneapolis
,
and
his
chief
struggle
had
been
*NL*
the
concealing
from
``
the
other
guys
at
school
''
how
particularly
superior
*NL*
he
felt
himself
to
be
,
yet
this
conviction
was
built
upon
shifting
*NL*
sands
.
He
had
shown
off
one
day
in
French
class
-LRB-
he
was
in
senior
French
*NL*
class
-RRB-
to
the
utter
confusion
of
Mr.
Reardon
,
whose
accent
Amory
damned
*NL*
contemptuously
,
and
to
the
delight
of
the
class
.
Mr.
Reardon
,
who
had
*NL*
spent
several
weeks
in
Paris
ten
years
before
,
took
his
revenge
on
the
*NL*
verbs
,
whenever
he
had
his
book
open
.
But
another
time
Amory
showed
off
*NL*
in
history
class
,
with
quite
disastrous
results
,
for
the
boys
there
*NL*
were
his
own
age
,
and
they
shrilled
innuendoes
at
each
other
all
the
*NL*
following
week
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aw
--
I
b
`
lieve
,
doncherknow
,
the
Umuricun
revolution
was
_
lawgely
_
an
*NL*
affair
of
the
middul
_
clawses
_
,
''
or
*NL*
*NL*
``
Washington
came
of
very
good
blood
--
aw
,
quite
good
--
I
b
`
lieve
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
ingeniously
tried
to
retrieve
himself
by
blundering
on
purpose
.
*NL*
Two
years
before
he
had
commenced
a
history
of
the
United
States
which
,
*NL*
though
it
only
got
as
far
as
the
Colonial
Wars
,
had
been
pronounced
by
*NL*
his
mother
completely
enchanting
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
chief
disadvantage
lay
in
athletics
,
but
as
soon
as
he
discovered
*NL*
that
it
was
the
touchstone
of
power
and
popularity
at
school
,
he
began
*NL*
to
make
furious
,
persistent
efforts
to
excel
in
the
winter
sports
,
and
*NL*
with
his
ankles
aching
and
bending
in
spite
of
his
efforts
,
he
skated
*NL*
valiantly
around
the
Lorelie
rink
every
afternoon
,
wondering
how
soon
*NL*
he
would
be
able
to
carry
a
hockey-stick
without
getting
it
inexplicably
*NL*
tangled
in
his
skates
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
invitation
to
Miss
Myra
St.
Claire
's
bobbing
party
spent
the
morning
*NL*
in
his
coat
pocket
,
where
it
had
an
intense
physical
affair
with
a
dusty
*NL*
piece
of
peanut
brittle
.
During
the
afternoon
he
brought
it
to
light
*NL*
with
a
sigh
,
and
after
some
consideration
and
a
preliminary
draft
in
the
*NL*
back
of
Collar
and
Daniel
's
``
First-Year
Latin
,
''
composed
an
answer
:
*NL*
*NL*
My
dear
Miss
St.
Claire
:
*NL*
Your
truly
charming
envitation
for
the
evening
of
next
Thursday
*NL*
evening
was
truly
delightful
to
receive
this
morning
.
I
will
be
*NL*
charm
and
inchanted
indeed
to
present
my
compliments
on
next
*NL*
Thursday
evening
.
*NL*
Faithfully
,
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
Blaine
.
*NL*
*NL*
*****
*NL*
*NL*
On
Thursday
,
therefore
,
he
walked
pensively
along
the
slippery
,
*NL*
shovel-scraped
sidewalks
,
and
came
in
sight
of
Myra
's
house
,
on
the
*NL*
half-hour
after
five
,
a
lateness
which
he
fancied
his
mother
would
*NL*
have
favored
.
He
waited
on
the
door-step
with
his
eyes
nonchalantly
*NL*
half-closed
,
and
planned
his
entrance
with
precision
.
He
would
cross
*NL*
the
floor
,
not
too
hastily
,
to
Mrs.
St.
Claire
,
and
say
with
exactly
the
*NL*
correct
modulation
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
_
dear
_
Mrs.
St.
Claire
,
I
'm
_
frightfully
_
sorry
to
be
late
,
but
my
*NL*
maid
''
--
he
paused
there
and
realized
he
would
be
quoting
--
``
but
my
uncle
*NL*
and
I
had
to
see
a
fella
--
Yes
,
I
've
met
your
enchanting
daughter
at
*NL*
dancing-school
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
would
shake
hands
,
using
that
slight
,
half-foreign
bow
,
with
all
*NL*
the
starchy
little
females
,
and
nod
to
the
fellas
who
would
be
standing
*NL*
`
round
,
paralyzed
into
rigid
groups
for
mutual
protection
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
butler
-LRB-
one
of
the
three
in
Minneapolis
-RRB-
swung
open
the
door
.
Amory
*NL*
stepped
inside
and
divested
himself
of
cap
and
coat
.
He
was
mildly
*NL*
surprised
not
to
hear
the
shrill
squawk
of
conversation
from
the
next
*NL*
room
,
and
he
decided
it
must
be
quite
formal
.
He
approved
of
that
--
as
he
*NL*
approved
of
the
butler
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Myra
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
his
surprise
the
butler
grinned
horribly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yeah
,
''
he
declared
,
``
she
's
here
.
''
He
was
unaware
that
his
failure
*NL*
to
be
cockney
was
ruining
his
standing
.
Amory
considered
him
coldly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
''
continued
the
butler
,
his
voice
rising
unnecessarily
,
``
she
's
the
*NL*
only
one
what
_
is
_
here
.
The
party
's
gone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
gasped
in
sudden
horror
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
been
waitin
'
for
Amory
Blaine
.
That
's
you
,
ai
n't
it
?
Her
mother
*NL*
says
that
if
you
showed
up
by
five-thirty
you
two
was
to
go
after
'em
in
*NL*
the
Packard
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
's
despair
was
crystallized
by
the
appearance
of
Myra
herself
,
*NL*
bundled
to
the
ears
in
a
polo
coat
,
her
face
plainly
sulky
,
her
voice
*NL*
pleasant
only
with
difficulty
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Lo
,
Amory
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Lo
,
Myra
.
''
He
had
described
the
state
of
his
vitality
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
you
_
got
_
here
,
_
any_ways
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
I
'll
tell
you
.
I
guess
you
do
n't
know
about
the
auto
accident
,
''
*NL*
he
romanced
.
*NL*
*NL*
Myra
's
eyes
opened
wide
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
was
it
to
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
he
continued
desperately
,
``
uncle
'n
aunt
'n
I.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
any
one
_
killed
?
_
''
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
paused
and
then
nodded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
uncle
?
''
--
alarm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
just
a
horse
--
a
sorta
gray
horse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
point
the
Erse
butler
snickered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Probably
killed
the
engine
,
''
he
suggested
.
Amory
would
have
put
him
on
*NL*
the
rack
without
a
scruple
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
'll
go
now
,
''
said
Myra
coolly
.
``
You
see
,
Amory
,
the
bobs
were
ordered
*NL*
for
five
and
everybody
was
here
,
so
we
could
n't
wait
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
could
n't
help
it
,
could
I
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
mama
said
for
me
to
wait
till
ha
`
past
five
.
We
'll
catch
the
bobs
*NL*
before
it
gets
to
the
Minnehaha
Club
,
Amory
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
's
shredded
poise
dropped
from
him
.
He
pictured
the
happy
party
*NL*
jingling
along
snowy
streets
,
the
appearance
of
the
limousine
,
the
*NL*
horrible
public
descent
of
him
and
Myra
before
sixty
reproachful
eyes
,
*NL*
his
apology
--
a
real
one
this
time
.
He
sighed
aloud
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
inquired
Myra
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
.
I
was
just
yawning
.
Are
we
going
to
_
surely
_
catch
up
with
'em
*NL*
before
they
get
there
?
''
He
was
encouraging
a
faint
hope
that
they
might
*NL*
slip
into
the
Minnehaha
Club
and
meet
the
others
there
,
be
found
in
*NL*
blase
seclusion
before
the
fire
and
quite
regain
his
lost
attitude
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
sure
Mike
,
we
'll
catch
'em
all
right
--
let
's
hurry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
became
conscious
of
his
stomach
.
As
they
stepped
into
the
machine
he
*NL*
hurriedly
slapped
the
paint
of
diplomacy
over
a
rather
box-like
plan
*NL*
he
had
conceived
.
It
was
based
upon
some
``
trade-lasts
''
gleaned
at
*NL*
dancing-school
,
to
the
effect
that
he
was
``
awful
good-looking
and
*NL*
_
English
_
,
sort
of
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Myra
,
''
he
said
,
lowering
his
voice
and
choosing
his
words
carefully
,
*NL*
``
I
beg
a
thousand
pardons
.
Can
you
ever
forgive
me
?
''
She
regarded
*NL*
him
gravely
,
his
intent
green
eyes
,
his
mouth
,
that
to
her
*NL*
thirteen-year-old
,
arrow-collar
taste
was
the
quintessence
of
romance
.
*NL*
Yes
,
Myra
could
forgive
him
very
easily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
--
yes
--
sure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
at
her
again
,
and
then
dropped
his
eyes
.
He
had
lashes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
awful
,
''
he
said
sadly
.
``
I
'm
diff
`
runt
.
I
do
n't
know
why
I
make
faux
*NL*
pas
.
'Cause
I
do
n't
care
,
I
s
`
pose
.
''
Then
,
recklessly
:
``
I
been
smoking
*NL*
too
much
.
I
've
got
t
`
bacca
heart
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Myra
pictured
an
all-night
tobacco
debauch
,
with
Amory
pale
and
reeling
*NL*
from
the
effect
of
nicotined
lungs
.
She
gave
a
little
gasp
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
_
Amory
_
,
do
n't
smoke
.
You
'll
stunt
your
_
growth
!
_
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
care
,
''
he
persisted
gloomily
.
``
I
got
ta
.
I
got
the
habit
.
I
've
*NL*
done
a
lot
of
things
that
if
my
fambly
knew
''
--
he
hesitated
,
giving
her
*NL*
imagination
time
to
picture
dark
horrors
--
``
I
went
to
the
burlesque
show
*NL*
last
week
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Myra
was
quite
overcome
.
He
turned
the
green
eyes
on
her
again
.
``
You
're
*NL*
the
only
girl
in
town
I
like
much
,
''
he
exclaimed
in
a
rush
of
sentiment
.
*NL*
``
You
're
simpatico
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Myra
was
not
sure
that
she
was
,
but
it
sounded
stylish
though
vaguely
*NL*
improper
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thick
dusk
had
descended
outside
,
and
as
the
limousine
made
a
sudden
*NL*
turn
she
was
jolted
against
him
;
their
hands
touched
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
should
n't
smoke
,
Amory
,
''
she
whispered
.
``
Do
n't
you
know
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
shook
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nobody
cares
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Myra
hesitated
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
I
_
care
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Something
stirred
within
Amory
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
you
do
!
You
got
a
crush
on
Froggy
Parker
.
I
guess
everybody
*NL*
knows
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
have
n't
,
''
very
slowly
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
silence
,
while
Amory
thrilled
.
There
was
something
fascinating
about
*NL*
Myra
,
shut
away
here
cosily
from
the
dim
,
chill
air
.
Myra
,
a
little
*NL*
bundle
of
clothes
,
with
strands
of
yellow
hair
curling
out
from
under
*NL*
her
skating
cap
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
I
've
got
a
crush
,
too
--
''
He
paused
,
for
he
heard
in
the
*NL*
distance
the
sound
of
young
laughter
,
and
,
peering
through
the
frosted
*NL*
glass
along
the
lamp-lit
street
,
he
made
out
the
dark
outline
of
the
*NL*
bobbing
party
.
He
must
act
quickly
.
He
reached
over
with
a
violent
,
*NL*
jerky
effort
,
and
clutched
Myra
's
hand
--
her
thumb
,
to
be
exact
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
him
to
go
to
the
Minnehaha
straight
,
''
he
whispered
.
``
I
wanta
talk
*NL*
to
you
--
I
_
got
_
to
talk
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Myra
made
out
the
party
ahead
,
had
an
instant
vision
of
her
mother
,
and
*NL*
then
--
alas
for
convention
--
glanced
into
the
eyes
beside
.
``
Turn
down
this
*NL*
side
street
,
Richard
,
and
drive
straight
to
the
Minnehaha
Club
!
''
she
*NL*
cried
through
the
speaking
tube
.
Amory
sank
back
against
the
cushions
*NL*
with
a
sigh
of
relief
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
kiss
her
,
''
he
thought
.
``
I
'll
bet
I
can
.
I
'll
_
bet
_
I
can
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Overhead
the
sky
was
half
crystalline
,
half
misty
,
and
the
night
around
*NL*
was
chill
and
vibrant
with
rich
tension
.
From
the
Country
Club
steps
the
*NL*
roads
stretched
away
,
dark
creases
on
the
white
blanket
;
huge
heaps
of
*NL*
snow
lining
the
sides
like
the
tracks
of
giant
moles
.
They
lingered
for
*NL*
a
moment
on
the
steps
,
and
watched
the
white
holiday
moon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pale
moons
like
that
one
''
--
Amory
made
a
vague
gesture
--
``
make
people
*NL*
mysterieuse
.
You
look
like
a
young
witch
with
her
cap
off
and
her
hair
*NL*
sorta
mussed
''
--
her
hands
clutched
at
her
hair
--
``
Oh
,
leave
it
,
it
looks
*NL*
_
good
_
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
drifted
up
the
stairs
and
Myra
led
the
way
into
the
little
den
of
*NL*
his
dreams
,
where
a
cosy
fire
was
burning
before
a
big
sink-down
couch
.
*NL*
A
few
years
later
this
was
to
be
a
great
stage
for
Amory
,
a
cradle
for
*NL*
many
an
emotional
crisis
.
Now
they
talked
for
a
moment
about
bobbing
*NL*
parties
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
always
a
bunch
of
shy
fellas
,
''
he
commented
,
``
sitting
at
the
*NL*
tail
of
the
bob
,
sorta
lurkin
'
an
'
whisperin
'
an
'
pushin
'
each
other
*NL*
off
.
Then
there
's
always
some
crazy
cross-eyed
girl
''
--
he
gave
a
*NL*
terrifying
imitation
--
``
she
's
always
talkin
'
_
hard
_
,
sorta
,
to
the
*NL*
chaperon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
such
a
funny
boy
,
''
puzzled
Myra
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
d'
y
'
mean
?
''
Amory
gave
immediate
attention
,
on
his
own
ground
at
*NL*
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
--
always
talking
about
crazy
things
.
Why
do
n't
you
come
ski-ing
with
*NL*
Marylyn
and
I
to-morrow
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
like
girls
in
the
daytime
,
''
he
said
shortly
,
and
then
,
thinking
*NL*
this
a
bit
abrupt
,
he
added
:
``
But
I
like
you
.
''
He
cleared
his
throat
.
``
I
*NL*
like
you
first
and
second
and
third
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Myra
's
eyes
became
dreamy
.
What
a
story
this
would
make
to
tell
*NL*
Marylyn
!
Here
on
the
couch
with
this
_
wonderful
_
-
looking
boy
--
the
little
*NL*
fire
--
the
sense
that
they
were
alone
in
the
great
building
--
*NL*

Myra
capitulated
.
The
atmosphere
was
too
appropriate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
like
you
the
first
twenty-five
,
''
she
confessed
,
her
voice
trembling
,
*NL*
``
and
Froggy
Parker
twenty-sixth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Froggy
had
fallen
twenty-five
places
in
one
hour
.
As
yet
he
had
not
even
*NL*
noticed
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Amory
,
being
on
the
spot
,
leaned
over
quickly
and
kissed
Myra
's
*NL*
cheek
.
He
had
never
kissed
a
girl
before
,
and
he
tasted
his
lips
*NL*
curiously
,
as
if
he
had
munched
some
new
fruit
.
Then
their
lips
brushed
*NL*
like
young
wild
flowers
in
the
wind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
're
awful
,
''
rejoiced
Myra
gently
.
She
slipped
her
hand
into
his
,
*NL*
her
head
drooped
against
his
shoulder
.
Sudden
revulsion
seized
Amory
,
*NL*
disgust
,
loathing
for
the
whole
incident
.
He
desired
frantically
to
*NL*
be
away
,
never
to
see
Myra
again
,
never
to
kiss
any
one
;
he
became
*NL*
conscious
of
his
face
and
hers
,
of
their
clinging
hands
,
and
he
wanted
*NL*
to
creep
out
of
his
body
and
hide
somewhere
safe
out
of
sight
,
up
in
the
*NL*
corner
of
his
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Kiss
me
again
.
''
Her
voice
came
out
of
a
great
void
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
want
to
,
''
he
heard
himself
saying
.
There
was
another
pause
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
want
to
!
''
he
repeated
passionately
.
*NL*
*NL*
Myra
sprang
up
,
her
cheeks
pink
with
bruised
vanity
,
the
great
bow
on
*NL*
the
back
of
her
head
trembling
sympathetically
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hate
you
!
''
she
cried
.
``
Do
n't
you
ever
dare
to
speak
to
me
again
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
stammered
Amory
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
tell
mama
you
kissed
me
!
I
will
too
!
I
will
too
!
I
'll
tell
mama
,
*NL*
and
she
wo
n't
let
me
play
with
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
rose
and
stared
at
her
helplessly
,
as
though
she
were
a
new
animal
*NL*
of
whose
presence
on
the
earth
he
had
not
heretofore
been
aware
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
door
opened
suddenly
,
and
Myra
's
mother
appeared
on
the
threshold
,
*NL*
fumbling
with
her
lorgnette
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
she
began
,
adjusting
it
benignantly
,
``
the
man
at
the
desk
told
*NL*
me
you
two
children
were
up
here
--
How
do
you
do
,
Amory
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
watched
Myra
and
waited
for
the
crash
--
but
none
came
.
The
pout
*NL*
faded
,
the
high
pink
subsided
,
and
Myra
's
voice
was
placid
as
a
summer
*NL*
lake
when
she
answered
her
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
we
started
so
late
,
mama
,
that
I
thought
we
might
as
well

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
heard
from
below
the
shrieks
of
laughter
,
and
smelled
the
vapid
*NL*
odor
of
hot
chocolate
and
tea-cakes
as
he
silently
followed
mother
and
*NL*
daughter
down-stairs
.
The
sound
of
the
graphophone
mingled
with
the
*NL*
voices
of
many
girls
humming
the
air
,
and
a
faint
glow
was
born
and
*NL*
spread
over
him
:
*NL*
*NL*
``

SNAPSHOTS
OF
THE
YOUNG
EGOTIST
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
spent
nearly
two
years
in
Minneapolis
.
The
first
winter
he
wore
*NL*
moccasins
that
were
born
yellow
,
but
after
many
applications
of
oil
and
*NL*
dirt
assumed
their
mature
color
,
a
dirty
,
greenish
brown
;
he
wore
a
gray
*NL*
plaid
mackinaw
coat
,
and
a
red
toboggan
cap
.
His
dog
,
Count
Del
Monte
,
*NL*
ate
the
red
cap
,
so
his
uncle
gave
him
a
gray
one
that
pulled
down
over
*NL*
his
face
.
The
trouble
with
this
one
was
that
you
breathed
into
it
and
*NL*
your
breath
froze
;
one
day
the
darn
thing
froze
his
cheek
.
He
rubbed
*NL*
snow
on
his
cheek
,
but
it
turned
bluish-black
just
the
same
.
*NL*
*NL*
*****
*NL*
*NL*
The
Count
Del
Monte
ate
a
box
of
bluing
once
,
but
it
did
n't
hurt
him
.
*NL*
Later
,
however
,
he
lost
his
mind
and
ran
madly
up
the
street
,
bumping
*NL*
into
fences
,
rolling
in
gutters
,
and
pursuing
his
eccentric
course
out
*NL*
of
Amory
's
life
.
Amory
cried
on
his
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
little
Count
,
''
he
cried
.
``
Oh
,
_
poor
_
little
_
Count
!
_
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
several
months
he
suspected
Count
of
a
fine
piece
of
emotional
*NL*
acting
.
*NL*
*NL*
*****
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
and
Frog
Parker
considered
that
the
greatest
line
in
literature
*NL*
occurred
in
Act
III
of
``
Arsene
Lupin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
sat
in
the
first
row
at
the
Wednesday
and
Saturday
matinees
.
The
*NL*
line
was
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
one
ca
n't
be
a
great
artist
or
a
great
soldier
,
the
next
best
thing
*NL*
is
to
be
a
great
criminal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*****
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
fell
in
love
again
,
and
wrote
a
poem
.
This
was
it
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Marylyn
and
Sallee
,
*NL*
Those
are
the
girls
for
me
.
*NL*
Marylyn
stands
above
*NL*
Sallee
in
that
sweet
,
deep
love
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
interested
in
whether
McGovern
of
Minnesota
would
make
the
*NL*
first
or
second
All-American
,
how
to
do
the
card-pass
,
how
to
do
*NL*
the
coin-pass
,
chameleon
ties
,
how
babies
were
born
,
and
whether
*NL*
Three-fingered
Brown
was
really
a
better
pitcher
than
Christie
*NL*
Mathewson
.
*NL*
*NL*
Among
other
things
he
read
:
``
For
the
Honor
of
the
School

''
``

and
Jim-Jam
Jems
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
all
the
Henty
biasses
in
history
,
and
was
particularly
fond
of
*NL*
the
cheerful
murder
stories
of
Mary
Roberts
Rinehart
.
*NL*
*NL*
*****
*NL*
*NL*
School
ruined
his
French
and
gave
him
a
distaste
for
standard
authors
.
*NL*
His
masters
considered
him
idle
,
unreliable
and
superficially
clever
.
*NL*
*NL*
*****
*NL*
*NL*
He
collected
locks
of
hair
from
many
girls
.
He
wore
the
rings
of
*NL*
several
.
Finally
he
could
borrow
no
more
rings
,
owing
to
his
nervous
*NL*
habit
of
chewing
them
out
of
shape
.
This
,
it
seemed
,
usually
aroused
the
*NL*
jealous
suspicions
of
the
next
borrower
.
*NL*
*NL*
*****
*NL*
*NL*
All
through
the
summer
months
Amory
and
Frog
Parker
went
each
week
to
*NL*
the
Stock
Company
.
Afterward
they
would
stroll
home
in
the
balmy
air
of
*NL*
August
night
,
dreaming
along
Hennepin
and
Nicollet
Avenues
,
through
the
*NL*
gay
crowd
.
Amory
wondered
how
people
could
fail
to
notice
that
he
was
a
*NL*
boy
marked
for
glory
,
and
when
faces
of
the
throng
turned
toward
him
*NL*
and
ambiguous
eyes
stared
into
his
,
he
assumed
the
most
romantic
of
*NL*
expressions
and
walked
on
the
air
cushions
that
lie
on
the
asphalts
of
*NL*
fourteen
.
*NL*
*NL*
Always
,
after
he
was
in
bed
,
there
were
voices
--
indefinite
,
fading
,
*NL*
enchanting
--
just
outside
his
window
,
and
before
he
fell
asleep
he
would
*NL*
dream
one
of
his
favorite
waking
dreams
,
the
one
about
becoming
a
great
*NL*
half-back
,
or
the
one
about
the
Japanese
invasion
,
when
he
was
rewarded
*NL*
by
being
made
the
youngest
general
in
the
world
.
It
was
always
*NL*
the
becoming
he
dreamed
of
,
never
the
being
.
This
,
too
,
was
quite
*NL*
characteristic
of
Amory
.

*NL*
*NL*
CODE
OF
THE
YOUNG
EGOTIST
*NL*
*NL*
Before
he
was
summoned
back
to
Lake
Geneva
,
he
had
appeared
,
shy
but
*NL*
inwardly
glowing
,
in
his
first
long
trousers
,
set
off
by
a
purple
*NL*
accordion
tie
and
a
``
Belmont
''
collar
with
the
edges
unassailably
*NL*
meeting
,
purple
socks
,
and
handkerchief
with
a
purple
border
peeping
*NL*
from
his
breast
pocket
.
But
more
than
that
,
he
had
formulated
his
first
*NL*
philosophy
,
a
code
to
live
by
,
which
,
as
near
as
it
can
be
named
,
was
a
*NL*
sort
of
aristocratic
egotism
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
realized
that
his
best
interests
were
bound
up
with
those
of
a
*NL*
certain
variant
,
changing
person
,
whose
label
,
in
order
that
his
past
*NL*
might
always
be
identified
with
him
,
was
Amory
Blaine
.
Amory
marked
*NL*
himself
a
fortunate
youth
,
capable
of
infinite
expansion
for
good
or
*NL*
evil
.
He
did
not
consider
himself
a
``
strong
char
`
c
`
ter
,
''
but
relied
on
*NL*
his
facility
-LRB-
learn
things
sorta
quick
-RRB-
and
his
superior
mentality
-LRB-
read
*NL*
a
lotta
deep
books
-RRB-
.
He
was
proud
of
the
fact
that
he
could
never
*NL*
become
a
mechanical
or
scientific
genius
.
From
no
other
heights
was
he
*NL*
debarred
.
*NL*
*NL*
Physically
.
--
Amory
thought
that
he
was
exceedingly
handsome
.
He
was
.
He
*NL*
fancied
himself
an
athlete
of
possibilities
and
a
supple
dancer
.
*NL*
*NL*
Socially
.
--
Here
his
condition
was
,
perhaps
,
most
dangerous
.
He
granted
*NL*
himself
personality
,
charm
,
magnetism
,
poise
,
the
power
of
dominating
*NL*
all
contemporary
males
,
the
gift
of
fascinating
all
women
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mentally
.
--
Complete
,
unquestioned
superiority
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
a
confession
will
have
to
be
made
.
Amory
had
rather
a
Puritan
*NL*
conscience
.
Not
that
he
yielded
to
it
--
later
in
life
he
almost
*NL*
completely
slew
it
--
but
at
fifteen
it
made
him
consider
himself
a
*NL*
great
deal
worse
than
other
boys
...
unscrupulousness
...
the
desire
*NL*
to
influence
people
in
almost
every
way
,
even
for
evil
...
a
certain
*NL*
coldness
and
lack
of
affection
,
amounting
sometimes
to
cruelty
...
a
*NL*
shifting
sense
of
honor
...
an
unholy
selfishness
...
a
puzzled
,
furtive
*NL*
interest
in
everything
concerning
sex
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
,
also
,
a
curious
strain
of
weakness
running
crosswise
through
*NL*
his
make-up
...
a
harsh
phrase
from
the
lips
of
an
older
boy
-LRB-
older
boys
*NL*
usually
detested
him
-RRB-
was
liable
to
sweep
him
off
his
poise
into
surly
*NL*
sensitiveness
,
or
timid
stupidity
...
he
was
a
slave
to
his
own
moods
*NL*
and
he
felt
that
though
he
was
capable
of
recklessness
and
audacity
,
he
*NL*
possessed
neither
courage
,
perseverance
,
nor
self-respect
.
*NL*
*NL*
Vanity
,
tempered
with
self-suspicion
if
not
self-knowledge
,
a
sense
of
*NL*
people
as
automatons
to
his
will
,
a
desire
to
``
pass
''
as
many
boys
as
*NL*
possible
and
get
to
a
vague
top
of
the
world
...
with
this
background
did
*NL*
Amory
drift
into
adolescence
.

*NL*
*****
*NL*
*NL*
PREPARATORY
TO
THE
GREAT
ADVENTURE
*NL*
*NL*
The
train
slowed
up
with
midsummer
languor
at
Lake
Geneva
,
and
Amory
*NL*
caught
sight
of
his
mother
waiting
in
her
electric
on
the
gravelled
*NL*
station
drive
.
It
was
an
ancient
electric
,
one
of
the
early
types
,
and
*NL*
painted
gray
.
The
sight
of
her
sitting
there
,
slenderly
erect
,
and
*NL*
of
her
face
,
where
beauty
and
dignity
combined
,
melting
to
a
dreamy
*NL*
recollected
smile
,
filled
him
with
a
sudden
great
pride
of
her
.
As
they
*NL*
kissed
coolly
and
he
stepped
into
the
electric
,
he
felt
a
quick
fear
*NL*
lest
he
had
lost
the
requisite
charm
to
measure
up
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
boy
--
you
're
_
so
_
tall
...
look
behind
and
see
if
there
's
anything
*NL*
coming
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
left
and
right
,
she
slipped
cautiously
into
a
speed
of
two
*NL*
miles
an
hour
,
beseeching
Amory
to
act
as
sentinel
;
and
at
one
busy
*NL*
crossing
she
made
him
get
out
and
run
ahead
to
signal
her
forward
like
a
*NL*
traffic
policeman
.
Beatrice
was
what
might
be
termed
a
careful
driver
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
_
are
_
tall
--
but
you
're
still
very
handsome
--
you
've
skipped
the
*NL*
awkward
age
,
or
is
that
sixteen
;
perhaps
it
's
fourteen
or
fifteen
;
I
can
*NL*
never
remember
;
but
you
've
skipped
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
embarrass
me
,
''
murmured
Amory
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
my
dear
boy
,
what
odd
clothes
!
They
look
as
if
they
were
a
*NL*
_
set
_
--
do
n't
they
?
Is
your
underwear
purple
,
too
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
grunted
impolitely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
go
to
Brooks
'
and
get
some
really
nice
suits
.
Oh
,
we
'll
have
a
*NL*
talk
to-night
or
perhaps
to-morrow
night
.
I
want
to
tell
you
about
*NL*
your
heart
--
you
've
probably
been
neglecting
your
heart
--
and
you
do
n't
*NL*
_
know
_
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
thought
how
superficial
was
the
recent
overlay
of
his
own
*NL*
generation
.
Aside
from
a
minute
shyness
,
he
felt
that
the
old
cynical
*NL*
kinship
with
his
mother
had
not
been
one
bit
broken
.
Yet
for
the
first
*NL*
few
days
he
wandered
about
the
gardens
and
along
the
shore
in
a
state
*NL*
of
superloneliness
,
finding
a
lethargic
content
in
smoking
``
Bull
''
at
the
*NL*
garage
with
one
of
the
chauffeurs
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sixty
acres
of
the
estate
were
dotted
with
old
and
new
summer
houses
*NL*
and
many
fountains
and
white
benches
that
came
suddenly
into
sight
from
*NL*
foliage-hung
hiding-places
;
there
was
a
great
and
constantly
increasing
*NL*
family
of
white
cats
that
prowled
the
many
flower-beds
and
were
*NL*
silhouetted
suddenly
at
night
against
the
darkening
trees
.
It
was
on
*NL*
one
of
the
shadowy
paths
that
Beatrice
at
last
captured
Amory
,
after
Mr.
*NL*
Blaine
had
,
as
usual
,
retired
for
the
evening
to
his
private
library
.
*NL*
After
reproving
him
for
avoiding
her
,
she
took
him
for
a
long
*NL*
tete-a-tete
in
the
moonlight
.
He
could
not
reconcile
himself
to
her
*NL*
beauty
,
that
was
mother
to
his
own
,
the
exquisite
neck
and
shoulders
,
*NL*
the
grace
of
a
fortunate
woman
of
thirty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Amory
,
dear
,
''
she
crooned
softly
,
``
I
had
such
a
strange
,
weird
time
*NL*
after
I
left
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
,
Beatrice
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
I
had
my
last
breakdown
''
--
she
spoke
of
it
as
a
sturdy
,
gallant
*NL*
feat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
doctors
told
me
''
--
her
voice
sang
on
a
confidential
note
--
``
that
if
*NL*
any
man
alive
had
done
the
consistent
drinking
that
I
have
,
he
would
*NL*
have
been
physically
_
shattered
_
,
my
dear
,
and
in
his
_
grave
_
--
long
in
*NL*
his
grave
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
winced
,
and
wondered
how
this
would
have
sounded
to
Froggy
Parker
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
continued
Beatrice
tragically
,
``
I
had
dreams
--
wonderful
visions
.
''
*NL*
She
pressed
the
palms
of
her
hands
into
her
eyes
.
``
I
saw
bronze
rivers
*NL*
lapping
marble
shores
,
and
great
birds
that
soared
through
the
air
,
*NL*
parti-colored
birds
with
iridescent
plumage
.
I
heard
strange
music
and
*NL*
the
flare
of
barbaric
trumpets
--
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
had
snickered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
Amory
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
said
go
on
,
Beatrice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
was
all
--
it
merely
recurred
and
recurred
--
gardens
that
flaunted
*NL*
coloring
against
which
this
would
be
quite
dull
,
moons
that
whirled
and
*NL*
swayed
,
paler
than
winter
moons
,
more
golden
than
harvest
moons
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
quite
well
now
,
Beatrice
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
well
--
as
well
as
I
will
ever
be
.
I
am
not
understood
,
Amory
.
I
*NL*
know
that
ca
n't
express
it
to
you
,
Amory
,
but
--
I
am
not
understood
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
was
quite
moved
.
He
put
his
arm
around
his
mother
,
rubbing
his
*NL*
head
gently
against
her
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
Beatrice
--
poor
Beatrice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
about
_
you
_
,
Amory
.
Did
you
have
two
_
horrible
_
years
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
considered
lying
,
and
then
decided
against
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Beatrice
.
I
enjoyed
them
.
I
adapted
myself
to
the
bourgeoisie
.
*NL*
I
became
conventional
.
''
He
surprised
himself
by
saying
that
,
and
he
*NL*
pictured
how
Froggy
would
have
gaped
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Beatrice
,
''
he
said
suddenly
,
``
I
want
to
go
away
to
school
.
Everybody
in
*NL*
Minneapolis
is
going
to
go
away
to
school
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Beatrice
showed
some
alarm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
're
only
fifteen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
everybody
goes
away
to
school
at
fifteen
,
and
I
_
want
_
to
,
*NL*
Beatrice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
Beatrice
's
suggestion
the
subject
was
dropped
for
the
rest
of
the
*NL*
walk
,
but
a
week
later
she
delighted
him
by
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Amory
,
I
have
decided
to
let
you
have
your
way
.
If
you
still
want
to
,
*NL*
you
can
go
to
school
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
St.
Regis
's
in
Connecticut
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
felt
a
quick
excitement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
being
arranged
,
''
continued
Beatrice
.
``
It
's
better
that
you
should
*NL*
go
away
.
I
'd
have
preferred
you
to
have
gone
to
Eton
,
and
then
to
Christ
*NL*
Church
,
Oxford
,
but
it
seems
impracticable
now
--
and
for
the
present
*NL*
we
'll
let
the
university
question
take
care
of
itself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
going
to
do
,
Beatrice
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Heaven
knows
.
It
seems
my
fate
to
fret
away
my
years
in
this
country
.
*NL*
Not
for
a
second
do
I
regret
being
American
--
indeed
,
I
think
that
a
*NL*
regret
typical
of
very
vulgar
people
,
and
I
feel
sure
we
are
the
great
*NL*
coming
nation
--
yet
''
--
and
she
sighed
--
``
I
feel
my
life
should
have
drowsed
*NL*
away
close
to
an
older
,
mellower
civilization
,
a
land
of
greens
and
*NL*
autumnal
browns
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
did
not
answer
,
so
his
mother
continued
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
regret
is
that
you
have
n't
been
abroad
,
but
still
,
as
you
are
a
man
,
*NL*
it
's
better
that
you
should
grow
up
here
under
the
snarling
eagle
--
is
*NL*
that
the
right
term
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
agreed
that
it
was
.
She
would
not
have
appreciated
the
Japanese
*NL*
invasion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
do
I
go
to
school
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Next
month
.
You
'll
have
to
start
East
a
little
early
to
take
your
*NL*
examinations
.
After
that
you
'll
have
a
free
week
,
so
I
want
you
to
go
up
*NL*
the
Hudson
and
pay
a
visit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
who
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
Monsignor
Darcy
,
Amory
.
He
wants
to
see
you
.
He
went
to
Harrow
and
*NL*
then
to
Yale
--
became
a
Catholic
.
I
want
him
to
talk
to
you
--
I
feel
he
*NL*
can
be
such
a
help

She
stroked
his
auburn
hair
gently
.
``
Dear
Amory

*NL*
dear
Amory

*NL*
*NL*
``

*****
*NL*
*NL*
So
early
in
September
Amory
,
provided
with
``
six
suits

*NL*
six
suits

one
sweater

overcoat
,
winter
,
etc.
,
''
set
out
for
New
England
,
the
land
of
schools
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
Andover
and
Exeter
with
their
memories
of
New
England
*NL*
dead
--
large
,
college-like
democracies
;
St.
Mark
's
,
Groton
,
St.
*NL*
Regis
'
--
recruited
from
Boston
and
the
Knickerbocker
families
of
New
*NL*
York
;
St.
Paul
's
,
with
its
great
rinks
;
Pomfret
and
St.
George
's
,
*NL*
prosperous
and
well-dressed
;
Taft
and
Hotchkiss
,
which
prepared
*NL*
the
wealth
of
the
Middle
West
for
social
success
at
Yale
;
Pawling
,
*NL*
Westminster
,
Choate
,
Kent
,
and
a
hundred
others
;
all
milling
out
their
*NL*
well-set-up
,
conventional
,
impressive
type
,
year
after
year
;
their
*NL*
mental
stimulus
the
college
entrance
exams
;
their
vague
purpose
set
*NL*
forth
in
a
hundred
circulars
as
``
To
impart
a
Thorough
Mental
,
Moral
,
and
*NL*
Physical
Training
as
a
Christian
Gentleman
,
to
fit
the
boy
for
meeting
*NL*
the
problems
of
his
day
and
generation
,
and
to
give
a
solid
foundation
*NL*
in
the
Arts
and
Sciences
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
St.
Regis
'
Amory
stayed
three
days
and
took
his
exams
with
a
scoffing
*NL*
confidence
,
then
doubling
back
to
New
York
to
pay
his
tutelary
visit
.
*NL*
The
metropolis
,
barely
glimpsed
,
made
little
impression
on
him
,
except
*NL*
for
the
sense
of
cleanliness
he
drew
from
the
tall
white
buildings
seen
*NL*
from
a
Hudson
River
steamboat
in
the
early
morning
.
Indeed
,
his
mind
was
*NL*
so
crowded
with
dreams
of
athletic
prowess
at
school
that
he
considered
*NL*
this
visit
only
as
a
rather
tiresome
prelude
to
the
great
adventure
.
*NL*
This
,
however
,
it
did
not
prove
to
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
Monsignor
Darcy
's
house
was
an
ancient
,
rambling
structure
set
on
a
hill
*NL*
overlooking
the
river
,
and
there
lived
its
owner
,
between
his
trips
to
*NL*
all
parts
of
the
Roman-Catholic
world
,
rather
like
an
exiled
Stuart
king
*NL*
waiting
to
be
called
to
the
rule
of
his
land
.
Monsignor
was
forty-four
*NL*
then
,
and
bustling
--
a
trifle
too
stout
for
symmetry
,
with
hair
the
color
*NL*
of
spun
gold
,
and
a
brilliant
,
enveloping
personality
.
When
he
came
into
*NL*
a
room
clad
in
his
full
purple
regalia
from
thatch
to
toe
,
he
resembled
*NL*
a
Turner
sunset
,
and
attracted
both
admiration
and
attention
.
He
had
*NL*
written
two
novels
:
one
of
them
violently
anti-Catholic
,
just
before
his
*NL*
conversion
,
and
five
years
later
another
,
in
which
he
had
attempted
*NL*
to
turn
all
his
clever
jibes
against
Catholics
into
even
cleverer
*NL*
innuendoes
against
Episcopalians
.
He
was
intensely
ritualistic
,
*NL*
startlingly
dramatic
,
loved
the
idea
of
God
enough
to
be
a
celibate
,
and
*NL*
rather
liked
his
neighbor
.
*NL*
*NL*
Children
adored
him
because
he
was
like
a
child
;
youth
revelled
in
his
*NL*
company
because
he
was
still
a
youth
,
and
could
n't
be
shocked
.
In
the
*NL*
proper
land
and
century
he
might
have
been
a
Richelieu
--
at
present
he
*NL*
was
a
very
moral
,
very
religious
-LRB-
if
not
particularly
pious
-RRB-
clergyman
,
*NL*
making
a
great
mystery
about
pulling
rusty
wires
,
and
appreciating
life
*NL*
to
the
fullest
,
if
not
entirely
enjoying
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
and
Amory
took
to
each
other
at
first
sight
--
the
jovial
,
impressive
*NL*
prelate
who
could
dazzle
an
embassy
ball
,
and
the
green-eyed
,
intent
*NL*
youth
,
in
his
first
long
trousers
,
accepted
in
their
own
minds
a
*NL*
relation
of
father
and
son
within
a
half-hour
's
conversation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
boy
,
I
've
been
waiting
to
see
you
for
years
.
Take
a
big
chair
*NL*
and
we
'll
have
a
chat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
just
come
from
school
--
St.
Regis
's
,
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
your
mother
says
--
a
remarkable
woman
;
have
a
cigarette
--
I
'm
sure
*NL*
you
smoke
.
Well
,
if
you
're
like
me
,
you
loathe
all
science
and
*NL*
mathematics
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
nodded
vehemently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hate
'em
all
.
Like
English
and
history
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
.
You
'll
hate
school
for
a
while
,
too
,
but
I
'm
glad
you
're
*NL*
going
to
St.
Regis
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
it
's
a
gentleman
's
school
,
and
democracy
wo
n't
hit
you
so
*NL*
early
.
You
'll
find
plenty
of
that
in
college
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
to
go
to
Princeton
,
''
said
Amory
.
``
I
do
n't
know
why
,
but
I
think
*NL*
of
all
Harvard
men
as
sissies
,
like
I
used
to
be
,
and
all
Yale
men
as
*NL*
wearing
big
blue
sweaters
and
smoking
pipes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Monsignor
chuckled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
one
,
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
're
different
--
I
think
of
Princeton
as
being
lazy
and
*NL*
good-looking
and
aristocratic
--
you
know
,
like
a
spring
day
.
Harvard
*NL*
seems
sort
of
indoors
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
Yale
is
November
,
crisp
and
energetic
,
''
finished
Monsignor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
slipped
briskly
into
an
intimacy
from
which
they
never
recovered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
for
Bonnie
Prince
Charlie
,
''
announced
Amory
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
you
were
--
and
for
Hannibal
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
and
for
the
Southern
Confederacy
.
''
He
was
rather
sceptical
about
*NL*
being
an
Irish
patriot
--
he
suspected
that
being
Irish
was
being
somewhat
*NL*
common
--
but
Monsignor
assured
him
that
Ireland
was
a
romantic
lost
cause
*NL*
and
Irish
people
quite
charming
,
and
that
it
should
,
by
all
means
,
be
*NL*
one
of
his
principal
biasses
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
crowded
hour
which
included
several
more
cigarettes
,
and
during
*NL*
which
Monsignor
learned
,
to
his
surprise
but
not
to
his
horror
,
that
*NL*
Amory
had
not
been
brought
up
a
Catholic
,
he
announced
that
he
had
*NL*
another
guest
.
This
turned
out
to
be
the
Honorable
Thornton
Hancock
,
of
*NL*
Boston
,
ex-minister
to
The
Hague
,
author
of
an
erudite
history
of
the
*NL*
Middle
Ages
and
the
last
of
a
distinguished
,
patriotic
,
and
brilliant
*NL*
family
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
comes
here
for
a
rest
,
''
said
Monsignor
confidentially
,
treating
*NL*
Amory
as
a
contemporary
.
``
I
act
as
an
escape
from
the
weariness
of
*NL*
agnosticism
,
and
I
think
I
'm
the
only
man
who
knows
how
his
staid
old
*NL*
mind
is
really
at
sea
and
longs
for
a
sturdy
spar
like
the
Church
to
*NL*
cling
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Their
first
luncheon
was
one
of
the
memorable
events
of
Amory
's
early
*NL*
life
.
He
was
quite
radiant
and
gave
off
a
peculiar
brightness
and
*NL*
charm
.
Monsignor
called
out
the
best
that
he
had
thought
by
question
and
*NL*
suggestion
,
and
Amory
talked
with
an
ingenious
brilliance
of
a
thousand
*NL*
impulses
and
desires
and
repulsions
and
faiths
and
fears
.
He
and
*NL*
Monsignor
held
the
floor
,
and
the
older
man
,
with
his
less
receptive
,
*NL*
less
accepting
,
yet
certainly
not
colder
mentality
,
seemed
content
to
*NL*
listen
and
bask
in
the
mellow
sunshine
that
played
between
these
two
.
*NL*
Monsignor
gave
the
effect
of
sunlight
to
many
people
;
Amory
gave
it
in
*NL*
his
youth
and
,
to
some
extent
,
when
he
was
very
much
older
,
but
never
*NL*
again
was
it
quite
so
mutually
spontaneous
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
a
radiant
boy
,
''
thought
Thornton
Hancock
,
who
had
seen
the
*NL*
splendor
of
two
continents
and
talked
with
Parnell
and
Gladstone
and
*NL*
Bismarck
--
and
afterward
he
added
to
Monsignor
:
``
But
his
education
ought
*NL*
not
to
be
intrusted
to
a
school
or
college
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
for
the
next
four
years
the
best
of
Amory
's
intellect
was
*NL*
concentrated
on
matters
of
popularity
,
the
intricacies
of
a
university
*NL*
social
system
and
American
Society
as
represented
by
Biltmore
Teas
and
*NL*
Hot
Springs
golf-links
.
*NL*
*NL*
...
In
all
,
a
wonderful
week
,
that
saw
Amory
's
mind
turned
inside
out
,
a
*NL*
hundred
of
his
theories
confirmed
,
and
his
joy
of
life
crystallized
to
*NL*
a
thousand
ambitions
.
Not
that
the
conversation
was
scholastic
--
heaven
*NL*
forbid
!
Amory
had
only
the
vaguest
idea
as
to
what
Bernard
Shaw
was
--
but
*NL*
Monsignor
made
quite
as
much
out
of
``
The
Beloved
Vagabond
''
and
``
Sir
*NL*
Nigel
,
''
taking
good
care
that
Amory
never
once
felt
out
of
his
depth
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
trumpets
were
sounding
for
Amory
's
preliminary
skirmish
with
his
*NL*
own
generation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
not
sorry
to
go
,
of
course
.
With
people
like
us
our
home
is
*NL*
where
we
are
not

said
Monsignor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
``
No

THE
EGOTIST
DOWN
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
's
two
years
at
St.
Regis
'
,
though
in
turn
painful
and
triumphant
,
*NL*
had
as
little
real
significance
in
his
own
life
as
the
American
``
prep
''
*NL*
school
,
crushed
as
it
is
under
the
heel
of
the
universities
,
has
*NL*
to
American
life
in
general
.
We
have
no
Eton
to
create
the
*NL*
self-consciousness
of
a
governing
class
;
we
have
,
instead
,
clean
,
*NL*
flaccid
and
innocuous
preparatory
schools
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
all
wrong
at
the
start
,
was
generally
considered
both
conceited
*NL*
and
arrogant
,
and
universally
detested
.
He
played
football
intensely
,
*NL*
alternating
a
reckless
brilliancy
with
a
tendency
to
keep
himself
as
*NL*
safe
from
hazard
as
decency
would
permit
.
In
a
wild
panic
he
backed
out
*NL*
of
a
fight
with
a
boy
his
own
size
,
to
a
chorus
of
scorn
,
and
a
week
*NL*
later
,
in
desperation
,
picked
a
battle
with
another
boy
very
much
*NL*
bigger
,
from
which
he
emerged
badly
beaten
,
but
rather
proud
of
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
resentful
against
all
those
in
authority
over
him
,
and
this
,
*NL*
combined
with
a
lazy
indifference
toward
his
work
,
exasperated
every
*NL*
master
in
school
.
He
grew
discouraged
and
imagined
himself
a
pariah
;
*NL*
took
to
sulking
in
corners
and
reading
after
lights
.
With
a
dread
of
*NL*
being
alone
he
attached
a
few
friends
,
but
since
they
were
not
among
*NL*
the
elite
of
the
school
,
he
used
them
simply
as
mirrors
of
himself
,
*NL*
audiences
before
which
he
might
do
that
posing
absolutely
essential
to
*NL*
him
.
He
was
unbearably
lonely
,
desperately
unhappy
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
some
few
grains
of
comfort
.
Whenever
Amory
was
submerged
,
*NL*
his
vanity
was
the
last
part
to
go
below
the
surface
,
so
he
could
still
*NL*
enjoy
a
comfortable
glow
when
``
Wookey-wookey
,
''
the
deaf
old
housekeeper
,
*NL*
told
him
that
he
was
the
best-looking
boy
she
had
ever
seen
.
It
had
*NL*
pleased
him
to
be
the
lightest
and
youngest
man
on
the
first
football
*NL*
squad
;
it
pleased
him
when
Doctor
Dougall
told
him
at
the
end
of
a
*NL*
heated
conference
that
he
could
,
if
he
wished
,
get
the
best
marks
in
*NL*
school
.
But
Doctor
Dougall
was
wrong
.
It
was
temperamentally
impossible
*NL*
for
Amory
to
get
the
best
marks
in
school
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miserable
,
confined
to
bounds
,
unpopular
with
both
faculty
and
*NL*
students
--
that
was
Amory
's
first
term
.
But
at
Christmas
he
had
returned
*NL*
to
Minneapolis
,
tight-lipped
and
strangely
jubilant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
was
sort
of
fresh
at
first
,
''
he
told
Frog
Parker
patronizingly
,
*NL*
``
but
I
got
along
fine
--
lightest
man
on
the
squad
.
You
ought
to
go
away
*NL*
to
school
,
Froggy

It
's
great
stuff

INCIDENT
OF
THE
WELL-MEANING
PROFESSOR
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
last
night
of
his
first
term
,
Mr.
Margotson
,
the
senior
master
,
*NL*
sent
word
to
study
hall
that
Amory
was
to
come
to
his
room
at
nine
.
*NL*
Amory
suspected
that
advice
was
forthcoming
,
but
he
determined
to
be
*NL*
courteous
,
because
this
Mr.
Margotson
had
been
kindly
disposed
toward
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
summoner
received
him
gravely
,
and
motioned
him
to
a
chair
.
He
*NL*
hemmed
several
times
and
looked
consciously
kind
,
as
a
man
will
when
he
*NL*
knows
he
's
on
delicate
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Amory

''
he
began
.
``
I

you
on

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

the
makings
of

a
very
good
man

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

sir
,
''
Amory
managed
to
articulate
.
He
hated
having
people
talk
as
*NL*
if
he
were
an
admitted
failure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
've
noticed

continued
the
older
man
blindly
,
``
that
you
're
not
*NL*
very
popular
with
the
boys
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

''
Amory
licked
his
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

I
thought
you
might
not
understand
exactly
what
it
*NL*
was

I
'm
going
to
tell
you
,
because
I
*NL*
believe

that
when
a
boy
knows
his
difficulties
he
's
better
able
to
*NL*
cope
with
them
--
to
conform
to
what
others
expect
of
him
.
''
He
a-hemmed
*NL*
again
with
delicate
reticence
,
and
continued
:
``
They
seem
to
think
that
*NL*
you
're
--
ah
--
rather
too
fresh
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
could
stand
no
more
.
He
rose
from
his
chair
,
scarcely
controlling
*NL*
his
voice
when
he
spoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know

oh

rose

He
paused

I

go
back

He
left
the
room
hurriedly
.
In
the
cool
air
outside
,
as
he
walked
to
his
*NL*
house
,
he
exulted
in
his
refusal
to
be
helped
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That

''
he
cried
wildly
.
``
As
if
I
did
n't

*NL*
*NL*
He
decided
,
however
,
that
this
was
a
good
excuse
not
to
go
back
to
study
*NL*
hall
that
night
,
so
,
comfortably
couched
up
in

he
munched

INCIDENT
OF
THE
WONDERFUL
GIRL
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
bright
star
in
February
.
New
York
burst
upon
him
on
*NL*
Washington
's
Birthday
with
the
brilliance
of
a
long-anticipated
event
.
*NL*
His
glimpse
of
it
as
a
vivid
whiteness
against
a
deep-blue
sky
had
left
*NL*
a
picture
of
splendor
that
rivalled
the
dream
cities
in
the
Arabian
*NL*
Nights
;
but
this
time
he
saw
it
by
electric
light
,
and
romance
gleamed
*NL*
from
the
chariot-race
sign
on
Broadway
and
from
the
women
's
eyes
at
the
*NL*
Astor
,
where
he
and
young
Paskert
from
St.
Regis
'
had
dinner
.
When
they
*NL*
walked
down
the
aisle
of
the
theatre
,
greeted
by
the
nervous
twanging
*NL*
and
discord
of
untuned
violins
and
the
sensuous
,
heavy
fragrance
of
*NL*
paint
and
powder
,
he
moved
in
a
sphere
of
epicurean
delight
.
Everything
*NL*
enchanted
him
.
The
play
was
``
The
Little
Millionaire
,
''
with
George
M.
*NL*
Cohan
,
and
there
was
one
stunning
young
brunette
who
made
him
sit
with
*NL*
brimming
eyes
in
the
ecstasy
of
watching
her
dance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
--
you
--
wonderful
girl
,
*NL*
What
a
wonderful
girl
you
are
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
sang
the
tenor
,
and
Amory
agreed
silently
,
but
passionately
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
--
your
--
wonderful
words
*NL*
Thrill
me
through
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
violins
swelled
and
quavered
on
the
last
notes
,
the
girl
sank
to
a
*NL*
crumpled
butterfly
on
the
stage
,
a
great
burst
of
clapping
filled
the
*NL*
house
.
Oh
,
to
fall
in
love
like
that
,
to
the
languorous
magic
melody
of
*NL*
such
a
tune
!
*NL*
*NL*
The
last
scene
was
laid
on
a
roof-garden
,
and
the
`
cellos
sighed
to
the
*NL*
musical
moon
,
while
light
adventure
and
facile
froth-like
comedy
flitted
*NL*
back
and
forth
in
the
calcium
.
Amory
was
on
fire
to
be
an
habitui
of
*NL*
roof-gardens
,
to
meet
a
girl
who
should
look
like
that
--
better
,
that
*NL*
very
girl
;
whose
hair
would
be
drenched
with
golden
moonlight
,
while
at
*NL*
his
elbow
sparkling
wine
was
poured
by
an
unintelligible
waiter
.
When
*NL*
the
curtain
fell
for
the
last
time
he
gave
such
a
long
sigh
that
the
*NL*
people
in
front
of
him
twisted
around
and
stared
and
said
loud
enough
*NL*
for
him
to
hear
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
_
remarkable
_
-
looking
boy
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
took
his
mind
off
the
play
,
and
he
wondered
if
he
really
did
seem
*NL*
handsome
to
the
population
of
New
York
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paskert
and
he
walked
in
silence
toward
their
hotel
.
The
former
was
*NL*
the
first
to
speak
.
His
uncertain
fifteen-year-old
voice
broke
in
in
a
*NL*
melancholy
strain
on
Amory
's
musings
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'd
marry
that
girl
to-night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
need
to
ask
what
girl
he
referred
to
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'd
be
proud
to
take
her
home
and
introduce
her
to
my
people
,
''
*NL*
continued
Paskert
.
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
was
distinctly
impressed
.
He
wished
he
had
said
it
instead
of
*NL*
Paskert
.
It
sounded
so
mature
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wonder
about
actresses
;
are
they
all
pretty
bad
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
_
sir
_
,
not
by
a
darn
sight
,
''
said
the
worldly
youth
with
emphasis
,
*NL*
``
and
I
know
that
girl
's
as
good
as
gold
.
I
can
tell
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
wandered
on
,
mixing
in
the
Broadway
crowd
,
dreaming
on
the
music
*NL*
that
eddied
out
of
the
cafes
.
New
faces
flashed
on
and
off
like
*NL*
myriad
lights
,
pale
or
rouged
faces
,
tired
,
yet
sustained
by
a
weary
*NL*
excitement
.
Amory
watched
them
in
fascination
.
He
was
planning
his
life
.
*NL*
He
was
going
to
live
in
New
York
,
and
be
known
at
every
restaurant
and
*NL*
cafe
,
wearing
a
dress-suit
from
early
evening
to
early
morning
,
sleeping
*NL*
away
the
dull
hours
of
the
forenoon
.
*NL*

``
Yes

HEROIC
IN
GENERAL
TONE
*NL*
*NL*
October
of
his
second
and
last
year
at
St.
Regis
'
was
a
high
point
in
*NL*
Amory
's
memory
.
The
game
with
Groton
was
played
from
three
of
a
snappy
,
*NL*
exhilarating
afternoon
far
into
the
crisp
autumnal
twilight
,
and
Amory
*NL*
at
quarter-back
,
exhorting
in
wild
despair
,
making
impossible
tackles
,
*NL*
calling
signals
in
a
voice
that
had
diminished
to
a
hoarse
,
furious
*NL*
whisper
,
yet
found
time
to
revel
in
the
blood-stained
bandage
around
his
*NL*
head
,
and
the
straining
,
glorious
heroism
of
plunging
,
crashing
bodies
*NL*
and
aching
limbs
.
For
those
minutes
courage
flowed
like
wine
out
of
the
*NL*
November
dusk
,
and
he
was
the
eternal
hero
,
one
with
the
sea-rover
on
*NL*
the
prow
of
a
Norse
galley
,
one
with
Roland
and
Horatius
,
Sir
Nigel
and
*NL*
Ted
Coy
,
scraped
and
stripped
into
trim
and
then
flung
by
his
own
will
*NL*
into
the
breach
,
beating
back
the
tide
,
hearing
from
afar
the
thunder
of
*NL*
cheers
...
finally
bruised
and
weary
,
but
still
elusive
,
circling
an
end
,
*NL*
twisting
,
changing
pace
,
straight-arming
...
falling
behind
the
Groton
*NL*
goal
with
two
men
on
his
legs
,
in
the
only
touchdown
of
the
game

THE
PHILOSOPHY
OF
THE
SLICKER
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
scoffing
superiority
of
sixth-form
year
and
success
Amory
*NL*
looked
back
with
cynical
wonder
on
his
status
of
the
year
before
.
He
was
*NL*
changed
as
completely
as
Amory
Blaine
could
ever
be
changed
.
Amory
plus
*NL*
Beatrice
plus
two
years
in
Minneapolis
--
these
had
been
his
ingredients
*NL*
when
he
entered
St.
Regis
'
.
But
the
Minneapolis
years
were
not
a
thick
*NL*
enough
overlay
to
conceal
the
``
Amory
plus
Beatrice
''
from
the
ferreting
*NL*
eyes
of
a
boarding-school
,
so
St.
Regis
'
had
very
painfully
drilled
*NL*
Beatrice
out
of
him
,
and
begun
to
lay
down
new
and
more
conventional
*NL*
planking
on
the
fundamental
Amory
.
But
both
St.
Regis
'
and
Amory
were
*NL*
unconscious
of
the
fact
that
this
fundamental
Amory
had
not
in
himself
*NL*
changed
.
Those
qualities
for
which
he
had
suffered
,
his
moodiness
,
his
*NL*
tendency
to
pose
,
his
laziness
,
and
his
love
of
playing
the
fool
,
were
*NL*
now
taken
as
a
matter
of
course
,
recognized
eccentricities
in
a
star
*NL*
quarter-back
,
a
clever
actor
,
and
the
editor
of
the
St.
Regis
Tattler
:
*NL*
it
puzzled
him
to
see
impressionable
small
boys
imitating
the
very
*NL*
vanities
that
had
not
long
ago
been
contemptible
weaknesses
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
football
season
he
slumped
into
dreamy
content
.
The
night
*NL*
of
the
pre-holiday
dance
he
slipped
away
and
went
early
to
bed
for
the
*NL*
pleasure
of
hearing
the
violin
music
cross
the
grass
and
come
surging
in
*NL*
at
his
window
.
Many
nights
he
lay
there
dreaming
awake
of
secret
cafes
*NL*
in
Mont
Martre
,
where
ivory
women
delved
in
romantic
mysteries
with
*NL*
diplomats
and
soldiers
of
fortune
,
while
orchestras
played
Hungarian
*NL*
waltzes
and
the
air
was
thick
and
exotic
with
intrigue
and
moonlight
*NL*
and
adventure
.
In
the
spring
he
read
``
L'Allegro
,
''
by
request
,
and
was
*NL*
inspired
to
lyrical
outpourings
on
the
subject
of
Arcady
and
the
pipes
*NL*
of
Pan
.
He
moved
his
bed
so
that
the
sun
would
wake
him
at
dawn
that
he
*NL*
might
dress
and
go
out
to
the
archaic
swing
that
hung
from
an
apple-tree
*NL*
near
the
sixth-form
house
.
Seating
himself
in
this
he
would
pump
higher
*NL*
and
higher
until
he
got
the
effect
of
swinging
into
the
wide
air
,
into
*NL*
a
fairyland
of
piping
satyrs
and
nymphs
with
the
faces
of
fair-haired
*NL*
girls
he
passed
in
the
streets
of
Eastchester
.
As
the
swing
reached
its
*NL*
highest
point
,
Arcady
really
lay
just
over
the
brow
of
a
certain
hill
,
*NL*
where
the
brown
road
dwindled
out
of
sight
in
a
golden
dot
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
read
voluminously
all
spring
,
the
beginning
of
his
eighteenth
year
:
*NL*
``
The
Gentleman
from
Indiana
,
''
``
The
New
Arabian
Nights
,
''
``
The
Morals
*NL*
of
Marcus
Ordeyne
,
''
``
The
Man
Who
Was
Thursday
,
''
which
he
liked
without
*NL*
understanding
;
``
Stover
at
Yale
,
''
that
became
somewhat
of
a
text-book
;
*NL*
``
Dombey
and
Son
,
''
because
he
thought
he
really
should
read
better
*NL*
stuff
;
Robert
Chambers
,
David
Graham
Phillips
,
and
E.
Phillips
Oppenheim
*NL*
complete
,
and
a
scattering
of
Tennyson
and
Kipling
.
Of
all
his
class
*NL*
work
only
``
L'Allegro
''
and
some
quality
of
rigid
clarity
in
solid
*NL*
geometry
stirred
his
languid
interest
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
June
drew
near
,
he
felt
the
need
of
conversation
to
formulate
his
*NL*
own
ideas
,
and
,
to
his
surprise
,
found
a
co-philosopher
in
Rahill
,
the
*NL*
president
of
the
sixth
form
.
In
many
a
talk
,
on
the
highroad
or
lying
*NL*
belly-down
along
the
edge
of
the
baseball
diamond
,
or
late
at
night
with
*NL*
their
cigarettes
glowing
in
the
dark
,
they
threshed
out
the
questions
of
*NL*
school
,
and
there
was
developed
the
term
``
slicker
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Got
tobacco
?
''
whispered
Rahill
one
night
,
putting
his
head
inside
the
*NL*
door
five
minutes
after
lights
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
coming
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
a
couple
of
pillows
and
lie
in
the
window-seat
,
why
do
n't
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
sat
up
in
bed
and
lit
a
cigarette
while
Rahill
settled
for
a
*NL*
conversation
.
Rahill
's
favorite
subject
was
the
respective
futures
of
*NL*
the
sixth
form
,
and
Amory
never
tired
of
outlining
them
for
his
benefit
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ted
Converse

At

easy

He
'll
fail
his

tutor

at

,
get
into
Sheff
with
about
four
conditions
,
and
flunk
out
in
*NL*
the
middle
of
the
freshman
year
.
Then
he
'll
go
back
West
and
raise
hell

for
a
year
or
so
;
finally
his
father
will
make
him
go
into

paint
*NL*

He
'll
marry
and
have
four
sons

He

always
*NL*
think

him
,
so
he
'll
send
his

school
in

Portland

He
'll
die
of
locomotor
ataxia
when
he

*NL*
his

whatever
you
call
it

``

But
Amory
knew
that

nothing
in

no

generality
,
ever
moved
Rahill
*NL*
until
he
stubbed
his
toe
upon
the
concrete
minutiae
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

insisted
Rahill
.
``

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
Amory
suddenly
.

*NL*
``

*NL*
``

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
one
?
What
makes
you

''
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
considered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
--
why
,
I
suppose
that
the
_
sign
_
of
it
is
when
a
fellow
slicks
his
*NL*
hair
back
with
water
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Like
Carstairs
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
sure
.
He
's
a
slicker
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
spent
two
evenings
getting
an
exact
definition
.
The
slicker
was
*NL*
good-looking
or
clean-looking
;
he
had
brains
,
social
brains
,
that
is
,
*NL*
and
he
used
all
means
on
the
broad
path
of
honesty
to
get
ahead
,
*NL*
be
popular
,
admired
,
and
never
in
trouble
.
He
dressed
well
,
was
*NL*
particularly
neat
in
appearance
,
and
derived
his
name
from
the
fact
that
*NL*
his
hair
was
inevitably
worn
short
,
soaked
in
water
or
tonic
,
parted
*NL*
in
the
middle
,
and
slicked
back
as
the
current
of
fashion
dictated
.
The
*NL*
slickers
of
that
year
had
adopted
tortoise-shell
spectacles
as
badges
*NL*
of
their
slickerhood
,
and
this
made
them
so
easy
to
recognize
that
Amory
*NL*
and
Rahill
never
missed
one
.
The
slicker
seemed
distributed
through
*NL*
school
,
always
a
little
wiser
and
shrewder
than
his
contemporaries
,
*NL*
managing
some
team
or
other
,
and
keeping
his
cleverness
carefully
*NL*
concealed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
found
the
slicker
a
most
valuable
classification
until
his
junior
*NL*
year
in
college
,
when
the
outline
became
so
blurred
and
indeterminate
*NL*
that
it
had
to
be
subdivided
many
times
,
and
became
only
a
quality
.
*NL*
Amory
's
secret
ideal
had
all
the
slicker
qualifications
,
but
,
in
*NL*
addition
,
courage
and
tremendous
brains
and
talents
--
also
Amory
conceded
*NL*
him
a
bizarre
streak
that
was
quite
irreconcilable
to
the
slicker
*NL*
proper
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
a
first
real
break
from
the
hypocrisy
of
school
tradition
.
The
*NL*
slicker
was
a
definite
element
of
success
,
differing
intrinsically
from
*NL*
the
prep
school
``

Amory
had

definitely
on
Princeton
,
even
though
he
would
be
the

only
boy
entering
that

from
St.

Yale
had
a
romance

glamour
from
the
tales
of
Minneapolis

and
St.

'
men
who
had
been
*NL*
``
tapped

Bones

but
Princeton
drew
him
most
,
with
*NL*
its
atmosphere
of
bright
colors
and
its
alluring
reputation
as
the
*NL*
pleasantest
country
club
in
America
.
Dwarfed
by
the
menacing
college
*NL*
exams
,
Amory
's
school
days
drifted
into
the
past
.
Years
afterward
,
when
*NL*
he
went
back
to
St.
Regis
'
,
he
seemed
to
have
forgotten
the
successes
*NL*
of
sixth-form
year
,
and
to
be
able
to
picture
himself
only
as
the
*NL*
unadjustable
boy
who
had
hurried
down
corridors

jeered
at
by
his
rabid

CHAPTER

.
Spires
and
Gargoyles
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
At
first
Amory
noticed
only
the
wealth
of
sunshine
creeping
across
the
*NL*
long
,
green
swards
,
dancing
on
the
leaded
window-panes
,
and
swimming
*NL*
around
the
tops
of
spires
and
towers
and
battlemented
walls
.
*NL*
Gradually
he
realized
that
he
was
really
walking
up
University
Place
,
*NL*
self-conscious
about
his
suitcase
,
developing
a
new
tendency
to
glare
*NL*
straight
ahead
when
he
passed
any
one
.
Several
times
he
could
have
sworn
*NL*
that
men
turned
to
look
at
him
critically
.
He
wondered
vaguely
if
there
*NL*
was
something
the
matter
with
his
clothes
,
and
wished
he
had
shaved
*NL*
that
morning
on
the
train
.
He
felt
unnecessarily
stiff
and
awkward
*NL*
among
these
white-flannelled
,
bareheaded
youths
,
who
must
be
juniors
and
*NL*
seniors
,
judging
from
the
savoir
faire
with
which
they
strolled
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
found
that
12
University
Place
was
a
large
,
dilapidated
mansion
,
at
*NL*
present
apparently
uninhabited
,
though
he
knew
it
housed
usually
a
dozen
*NL*
freshmen
.
After
a
hurried
skirmish
with
his
landlady
he
sallied
out
on
*NL*
a
tour
of
exploration
,
but
he
had
gone
scarcely
a
block
when
he
became
*NL*
horribly
conscious
that
he
must
be
the
only
man
in
town
who
was
wearing
*NL*
a
hat
.
He
returned
hurriedly
to
12
University
,
left
his
derby
,
*NL*
and
,
emerging
bareheaded
,
loitered
down
Nassau
Street
,
stopping
to
*NL*
investigate
a
display
of
athletic
photographs
in
a
store
window
,
*NL*
including
a
large
one
of
Allenby
,
the
football
captain
,
and
next
*NL*
attracted
by
the
sign
``
Jigger
Shop
''
over
a
confectionary
window
.
This
*NL*
sounded
familiar
,
so
he
sauntered
in
and
took
a
seat
on
a
high
stool
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Chocolate
sundae
,
''
he
told
a
colored
person
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Double
chocolate
jiggah
?
Anything
else
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
--
yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bacon
bun
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
--
yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
munched
four
of
these
,
finding
them
of
pleasing
savor
,
and
then
*NL*
consumed
another
double-chocolate
jigger
before
ease
descended
upon
him
.
*NL*
After
a
cursory
inspection
of
the
pillow-cases
,
leather
pennants
,
and
*NL*
Gibson
Girls
that
lined
the
walls
,
he
left
,
and
continued
along
Nassau
*NL*
Street
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
.
Gradually
he
was
learning
to
*NL*
distinguish
between
upper
classmen
and
entering
men
,
even
though
the
*NL*
freshman
cap
would
not
appear
until
the
following
Monday
.
Those
who
were
*NL*
too
obviously
,
too
nervously
at
home
were
freshmen
,
for
as
each
train
*NL*
brought
a
new
contingent
it
was
immediately
absorbed
into
the
hatless
,
*NL*
white-shod
,
book-laden
throng
,
whose
function
seemed
to
be
to
drift
*NL*
endlessly
up
and
down
the
street
,
emitting
great
clouds
of
smoke
*NL*
from
brand-new
pipes
.
By
afternoon
Amory
realized
that
now
the
*NL*
newest
arrivals
were
taking
him
for
an
upper
classman
,
and
he
tried
*NL*
conscientiously
to
look
both
pleasantly
blase
and
casually
critical
,
*NL*
which
was
as
near
as
he
could
analyze
the
prevalent
facial
expression
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
five
o'clock
he
felt
the
need
of
hearing
his
own
voice
,
so
he
*NL*
retreated
to
his
house
to
see
if
any
one
else
had
arrived
.
Having
*NL*
climbed
the
rickety
stairs
he
scrutinized
his
room
resignedly
,
*NL*
concluding
that
it
was
hopeless
to
attempt
any
more
inspired
decoration
*NL*
than
class
banners
and
tiger
pictures
.
There
was
a
tap
at
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
in
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
slim
face
with
gray
eyes
and
a
humorous
smile
appeared
in
the
doorway
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Got
a
hammer
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
sorry
.
Maybe
Mrs.
Twelve
,
or
whatever
she
goes
by
,
has
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
stranger
advanced
into
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
an
inmate
of
this
asylum
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
nodded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Awful
barn
for
the
rent
we
pay
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
had
to
agree
that
it
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
of
the
campus
,
''
he
said
,
``
but
they
say
there
's
so
few
*NL*
freshmen
that
they
're
lost
.
Have
to
sit
around
and
study
for
something
*NL*
to
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
gray-eyed
man
decided
to
introduce
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
name
's
Holiday
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Blaine
's
my
name
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
shook
hands
with
the
fashionable
low
swoop
.
Amory
grinned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
'd
you
prep
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Andover
--
where
did
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
St.
Regis
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
did
you
?
I
had
a
cousin
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
discussed
the
cousin
thoroughly
,
and
then
Holiday
announced
that
he
*NL*
was
to
meet
his
brother
for
dinner
at
six
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
along
and
have
a
bite
with
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
Kenilworth
Amory
met
Burne
Holiday
--
he
of
the
gray
eyes
was
*NL*
Kerry
--
and
during
a
limpid
meal
of
thin
soup
and
anaemic
vegetables
they
*NL*
stared
at
the
other
freshmen
,
who
sat
either
in
small
groups
looking
*NL*
very
ill
at
ease
,
or
in
large
groups
seeming
very
much
at
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hear
Commons
is
pretty
bad
,
''
said
Amory
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
the
rumor
.
But
you
've
got
to
eat
there
--
or
pay
anyways

*NL*
*NL*
``
Crime
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Imposition
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
at
Princeton
you
've
got
to
swallow
everything
the
first
year
.
It
's
*NL*
like
a
damned
prep
school
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
agreed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lot
of
pep
,
though
,
''
he
insisted
.
``
I
would
n't
have
gone
to
Yale
for
a
*NL*
million
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Me
either
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
going
out
for
anything
?
''
inquired
Amory
of
the
elder
brother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
me

Burne
here
is
going
out
for
the

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
know

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
going
out
for
anything
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
--
yes
.
I
'm
going
to
take
a
whack
at
freshman
football
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Play
at
St.
Regis
's
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Some
,
''
admitted
Amory
depreciatingly
,
``
but
I
'm
getting
so
damned
thin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
not
thin

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
used
to
be
stocky
last
fall
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
supper
they
attended
the
movies
,
where
Amory
was
fascinated
by
the
*NL*
glib
comments
of
a
man
in
front
of
him
,
as
well
as
by
the
wild
yelling
*NL*
and
shouting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yoho
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
honey-baby
--
you
're
so
big
and
strong
,
but
oh
,
so
gentle
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
Clinch
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Clinch
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Kiss
her
,
kiss

at
lady
,
quick
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh-h-h
--
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
group
began
whistling
``
By
the
Sea
,
''
and
the
audience
took
it
up
*NL*
noisily
.
This
was
followed
by
an
indistinguishable
song
that
included
*NL*
much
stamping
and
then
by
an
endless
,
incoherent
dirge
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh-h-h-h-h
*NL*
She
works
in
a
Jam
Factoree
*NL*
And

But

WELL
*NL*
That
she

N'T

*NL*
Oh-h-h-h

''
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
pushed
out
,
giving
and
receiving
curious
impersonal
glances
,
*NL*
Amory
decided
that
he
liked
the
movies
,
wanted
to
enjoy
them
as
the
row
*NL*
of
upper
classmen
in
front
had
enjoyed
them
,
with
their
arms
along
the
*NL*
backs
of
the
seats
,
their
comments
Gaelic
and
caustic
,
their
attitude
a
*NL*
mixture
of
critical
wit
and
tolerant
amusement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Want
a
sundae
--
I
mean
a
jigger
?
''
asked
Kerry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
suppered
heavily
and
then
,
still
sauntering
,
eased
back
to
12
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wonderful
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
whiz
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
men
going
to
unpack
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Guess
so
.
Come
on
,
Burne
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
decided
to
sit
for
a
while
on
the
front
steps
,
so
he
bade
them
*NL*
good
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
great
tapestries
of
trees
had
darkened
to
ghosts
back
at
the
last
*NL*
edge
of
twilight
.
The
early
moon
had
drenched
the
arches
with
pale
blue
,
*NL*
and
,
weaving
over
the
night
,
in
and
out
of
the
gossamer
rifts
of
moon
,
*NL*
swept
a
song
,
a
song
with
more
than
a
hint
of
sadness
,
infinitely
*NL*
transient
,
infinitely
regretful
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
remembered
that
an
alumnus
of
the
nineties
had
told
him
of
one
of
*NL*
Booth
Tarkington
's
amusements
:
standing
in
mid-campus
in
the
small
hours
*NL*
and
singing
tenor
songs
to
the
stars
,
arousing
mingled
emotions
in
the
*NL*
couched
undergraduates
according
to
the
sentiment
of
their
moods
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
far
down
the
shadowy
line
of
University
Place
a
white-clad
phalanx
*NL*
broke
the
gloom
,
and
marching
figures
,
white-shirted
,
white-trousered
,
*NL*
swung
rhythmically
up
the
street
,
with
linked
arms
and
heads
thrown
*NL*
back
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Going
back
--
going
back
,
*NL*
Going

''
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
closed
his
eyes
as
the
ghostly
procession
drew
near
.
The
song
*NL*
soared
so
high
that
all
dropped
out
except
the
tenors
,
who
bore
the
*NL*
melody
triumphantly
past
the
danger-point
and
relinquished
it
to
the
*NL*
fantastic
chorus
.
Then
Amory
opened
his
eyes
,
half
afraid
that
sight
*NL*
would
spoil
the
rich
illusion
of
harmony
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
sighed
eagerly
.
There
at
the
head
of
the
white
platoon
marched
*NL*
Allenby
,
the
football
captain
,
slim
and
defiant
,
as
if
aware
that
this
*NL*
year
the
hopes
of
the
college
rested
on
him
,
that
his
hundred-and-sixty
*NL*
pounds
were
expected
to
dodge
to
victory
through
the
heavy
blue
and
*NL*
crimson
lines
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fascinated
,
Amory
watched
each
rank
of
linked
arms
as
it
came
abreast
,
*NL*
the
faces
indistinct
above
the
polo
shirts
,
the
voices
blent
in
a
paean
*NL*
of
triumph
--
and
then
the
procession
passed
through
shadowy
Campbell
*NL*
Arch
,
and
the
voices
grew
fainter
as
it
wound
eastward
over
the
campus
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
minutes
passed
and
Amory
sat
there
very
quietly
.
He
regretted
the
*NL*
rule
that
would
forbid
freshmen
to
be
outdoors
after
curfew
,
for
he
*NL*
wanted
to
ramble
through
the
shadowy
scented
lanes
,
where
Witherspoon
*NL*
brooded
like
a
dark
mother
over
Whig
and
Clio
,
her
Attic
children
,
where
*NL*
the
black
Gothic
snake
of
Little
curled
down
to
Cuyler
and
Patton
,
these
*NL*
in
turn
flinging
the
mystery
out
over
the
placid
slope
rolling
to
the
*NL*
lake
.
*NL*
*NL*
*****
*NL*
*NL*
Princeton
of
the
daytime
filtered
slowly
into
his
consciousness
--
West
*NL*
and
Reunion
,
redolent
of
the
sixties
,
Seventy-nine
Hall
,
brick-red
and
*NL*
arrogant
,
Upper
and
Lower
Pyne
,
aristocratic
Elizabethan
ladies
not
*NL*
quite
content
to
live
among
shopkeepers
,
and
,
topping
all
,
climbing
with
*NL*
clear
blue
aspiration
,
the
great
dreaming
spires
of
Holder
and
Cleveland
*NL*
towers
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
first
he
loved
Princeton
--
its
lazy
beauty
,
its
half-grasped
*NL*
significance
,
the
wild
moonlight
revel
of
the
rushes
,
the
handsome
,
*NL*
prosperous
big-game
crowds
,
and
under
it
all
the
air
of
struggle
that
*NL*
pervaded
his
class
.
From
the
day
when
,
wild-eyed
and
exhausted
,
the
*NL*
jerseyed
freshmen
sat
in
the
gymnasium
and
elected
some
one
from
Hill
*NL*
School
class
president
,
a
Lawrenceville
celebrity
vice-president
,
a
*NL*
hockey
star
from
St.
Paul
's
secretary
,
up
until
the
end
of
sophomore
*NL*
year
it
never
ceased
,
that
breathless
social
system
,
that
worship
,
*NL*
seldom
named
,
never
really
admitted
,
of
the
bogey
``
Big
Man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
First
it
was
schools
,
and
Amory
,
alone
from
St.
Regis
'
,
watched
the
*NL*
crowds
form
and
widen
and
form
again
;
St.
Paul
's
,
Hill
,
Pomfret
,
eating
*NL*
at
certain
tacitly
reserved
tables
in
Commons
,
dressing
in
their
own
*NL*
corners
of
the
gymnasium
,
and
drawing
unconsciously
about
them
a
barrier
*NL*
of
the
slightly
less
important
but
socially
ambitious
to
protect
them
*NL*
from
the
friendly
,
rather
puzzled
high-school
element
.
From
the
*NL*
moment
he
realized
this
Amory
resented
social
barriers
as
artificial
*NL*
distinctions
made
by
the
strong
to
bolster
up
their
weak
retainers
and
*NL*
keep
out
the
almost
strong
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
decided
to
be
one
of
the
gods
of
the
class
,
he
reported
*NL*
for
freshman
football
practice
,
but
in
the
second
week
,
playing
*NL*
quarter-back
,
already
paragraphed
in
corners
of
the
Princetonian
,
he
*NL*
wrenched
his
knee
seriously
enough
to
put
him
out
for
the
rest
of
the
*NL*
season
.
This
forced
him
to
retire
and
consider
the
situation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
12
Univee
''
housed
a
dozen
miscellaneous
question-marks
.
There
were
*NL*
three
or
four
inconspicuous
and
quite
startled
boys
from
Lawrenceville
,
*NL*
two
amateur
wild
men
from
a
New
York
private
school
-LRB-
Kerry
Holiday
*NL*
christened
them
the
``
plebeian
drunks
''
-RRB-
,
a
Jewish
youth
,
also
from
New
*NL*
York
,
and
,
as
compensation
for
Amory
,
the
two
Holidays
,
to
whom
he
took
*NL*
an
instant
fancy
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Holidays
were
rumored
twins
,
but
really
the
dark-haired
one
,
Kerry
,
*NL*
was
a
year
older
than
his
blond
brother
,
Burne
.
Kerry
was
tall
,
with
*NL*
humorous
gray
eyes
,
and
a
sudden
,
attractive
smile
;
he
became
at
once
*NL*
the
mentor
of
the
house
,
reaper
of
ears
that
grew
too
high
,
censor
of
*NL*
conceit
,
vendor
of
rare
,
satirical
humor
.
Amory
spread
the
table
of
*NL*
their
future
friendship
with
all
his
ideas
of
what
college
should
and
*NL*
did
mean
.
Kerry
,
not
inclined
as
yet
to
take
things
seriously
,
chided
*NL*
him
gently
for
being
curious
at
this
inopportune
time
about
the
*NL*
intricacies
of
the
social
system
,
but
liked
him
and
was
both
interested
*NL*
and
amused
.
*NL*
*NL*
Burne
,
fair-haired
,
silent
,
and
intent
,
appeared
in
the
house
only
as
a
*NL*
busy
apparition
,
gliding
in
quietly
at
night
and
off
again
in
the
*NL*
early
morning
to
get
up
his
work
in
the
library
--
he
was
out
for
the
*NL*
Princetonian
,
competing
furiously
against
forty
others
for
the
coveted
*NL*
first
place
.
In
December
he
came
down
with
diphtheria
,
and
some
one
*NL*
else
won
the
competition
,
but
,
returning
to
college
in
February
,
*NL*
he
dauntlessly
went
after
the
prize
again
.
Necessarily
,
Amory
's
*NL*
acquaintance
with
him
was
in
the
way
of
three-minute
chats
,
walking
*NL*
to
and
from
lectures
,
so
he
failed
to
penetrate
Burne
's
one
absorbing
*NL*
interest
and
find
what
lay
beneath
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
was
far
from
contented
.
He
missed
the
place
he
had
won
at
St.
*NL*
Regis
'
,
the
being
known
and
admired
,
yet
Princeton
stimulated
him
,
and
*NL*
there
were
many
things
ahead
calculated
to
arouse
the
Machiavelli
latent
*NL*
in
him
,
could
he
but
insert
a
wedge
.
The
upper-class
clubs
,
concerning
*NL*
which
he
had
pumped
a
reluctant
graduate
during
the
previous
summer
,
*NL*
excited
his
curiosity
:
Ivy
,
detached
and
breathlessly
aristocratic
;
*NL*
Cottage
,
an
impressive
melange
of
brilliant
adventurers
and
well-dressed
*NL*
philanderers
;
Tiger
Inn
,
broad-shouldered
and
athletic
,
vitalized
by
*NL*
an
honest
elaboration
of
prep-school
standards
;
Cap
and
Gown
,
*NL*
anti-alcoholic
,
faintly
religious
and
politically
powerful
;
flamboyant
*NL*
Colonial
;
literary
Quadrangle
;
and
the
dozen
others
,
varying
in
age
and
*NL*
position
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anything
which
brought
an
under
classman
into
too
glaring
a
light
was
*NL*
labelled
with
the
damning
brand
of
``
running
it
out
.
''
The
movies
thrived
*NL*
on
caustic
comments
,
but
the
men
who
made
them
were
generally
running
*NL*
it
out
;
talking
of
clubs
was
running
it
out
;
standing
for
anything
*NL*
very
strongly
,
as
,
for
instance
,
drinking
parties
or
teetotalling
,
*NL*
was
running
it
out
;
in
short
,
being
personally
conspicuous
was
not
*NL*
tolerated
,
and
the
influential
man
was
the
non-committal
man
,
until
at
*NL*
club
elections
in
sophomore
year
every
one
should
be
sewed
up
in
some
*NL*
bag
for
the
rest
of
his
college
career
.
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
found
that
writing
for
the
Nassau
Literary
Magazine
would
get
him
*NL*
nothing
,
but
that
being
on
the
board
of
the
Daily
Princetonian
would
*NL*
get
any
one
a
good
deal
.
His
vague
desire
to
do
immortal
acting
with
*NL*
the
English
Dramatic
Association
faded
out
when
he
found
that
the
most
*NL*
ingenious
brains
and
talents
were
concentrated
upon
the
Triangle
Club
,
a
*NL*
musical
comedy
organization
that
every
year
took
a
great
Christmas
trip
.
*NL*
In
the
meanwhile
,
feeling
strangely
alone
and
restless
in
Commons
,
with
*NL*
new
desires
and
ambitions
stirring
in
his
mind
,
he
let
the
first
term
go
*NL*
by
between
an
envy
of
the
embryo
successes
and
a
puzzled
fretting
with
*NL*
Kerry
as
to
why
they
were
not
accepted
immediately
among
the
elite
of
*NL*
the
class
.
*NL*
*NL*
Many
afternoons
they
lounged
in
the
windows
of
12
Univee
and
watched
*NL*
the
class
pass
to
and
from
Commons
,
noting
satellites
already
attaching
*NL*
themselves
to
the
more
prominent
,
watching
the
lonely
grind
with
his
*NL*
hurried
step
and
downcast
eye
,
envying
the
happy
security
of
the
big
*NL*
school
groups
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
're
the
damned
middle
class
,
that
's
what
!
''
he
complained
to
Kerry
one
*NL*
day
as
he
lay
stretched
out
on
the
sofa
,
consuming
a
family
of
Fatimas
*NL*
with
contemplative
precision
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
why
not
?
We
came
to
Princeton
so
we
could
feel
that
way
toward
*NL*
the
small
colleges
--
have
it
on
'em
,
more
self-confidence
,
dress
better
,
*NL*
cut
a
swathe
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it
is
n't
that
I
mind
the
glittering
caste
system

''
admitted
Amory
.
*NL*
``
I
like
having
a
bunch
of
hot
cats
on
top

I
've
got

be
one
of
them

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
just
now

Amory
,
you
're
only

*NL*
*NL*
Amory
lay
for
a
moment
without
speaking
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wo
n't
be

long

he
said
finally
.
``
But
I
hate

get
anywhere

*NL*
*NL*
``
Honorable

Kerry
craned
his
neck
suddenly
at
the
street
.
*NL*
``
There
's
Langueduc

you
want
to
see
what
he
looks

*NL*
*NL*
Amory
rose
dynamically
and
sought
the
windows
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
he
said
,
scrutinizing
these
worthies
,
``
Humbird
looks
like
a
*NL*
knock-out
,
but
this
Langueduc

he
's
the
rugged
type

is
n't
he
?
I
*NL*
distrust
that
sort
.
All
diamonds
look
big
in
the
rough

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Kerry
,
as
the
excitement
subsided
,
``
you
're
a
literary
*NL*
genius

It
's
up
to
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wonder

Amory
paused
--
``
if
I
could

honestly
think
so
sometimes

Amory
reached
lazily
at

Amory
glanced
through
the

*NL*
``

said
in

up

*NL*
*****
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
gradually
accepted
this
point
of
view
,
decided
that
next
fall
*NL*
would
inaugurate
his
career
,
and
relinquished
himself
to
watching
Kerry
*NL*
extract
joy
from
12
Univee
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
filled
the
Jewish
youth
's
bed
with
lemon
pie
;
they
put
out
the
gas
*NL*
all
over
the
house
every
night
by
blowing
into
the
jet
in
Amory
's
room
,
*NL*
to
the
bewilderment
of
Mrs.
Twelve
and
the
local
plumber
;
they
set
up
*NL*
the
effects
of
the
plebeian
drunks
--
pictures
,
books
,
and
furniture
--
in
*NL*
the
bathroom
,
to
the
confusion
of
the
pair
,
who
hazily
discovered
*NL*
the
transposition
on
their
return
from
a
Trenton
spree
;
they
were
*NL*
disappointed
beyond
measure
when
the
plebeian
drunks
decided
to
take
it
*NL*
as
a
joke
;
they
played
red-dog
and
twenty-one
and
jackpot
from
dinner
*NL*
to
dawn
,
and
on
the
occasion
of
one
man
's
birthday
persuaded
him
to
buy
*NL*
sufficient
champagne
for
a
hilarious
celebration
.
The
donor
of
the
party
*NL*
having
remained
sober
,
Kerry
and
Amory
accidentally
dropped
him
down
two
*NL*
flights
of
stairs
and
called
,
shame-faced
and
penitent
,
at
the
infirmary
*NL*
all
the
following
week
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
,
who
are
all
these
women
?
''
demanded
Kerry
one
day
,
protesting
*NL*
at
the
size
of
Amory
's
mail
.
``
I
've
been
looking
at
the
postmarks
*NL*
lately

Farmington

Dobbs

what
's
the
*NL*
idea
?

*NL*
*NL*
Amory
grinned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
from
the
Twin
Cities

''
He
named
them
off
.
``
There
's
Marylyn
De

she

pretty

a
car
of

convenient

there

Sally
Weatherby

she
's
getting
too
fat
;
there
's
Myra
St.

she
's
an
old
flame

easy

you
like
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
What

do
you
throw

demanded
Kerry

``

*NL*
``

Amory

*NL*

Mother
always
feels

girl
is
safe

,
it
's
annoying

If
I
start
to
hold
somebody

they
laugh
*NL*
at
me
,
and
let
me
,
just
as
if
it
was
n't
part
of
them
.
As
soon
as
I
get
*NL*
hold
of
a
hand
they
sort
of
disconnect
it
from
the
rest
of
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sulk

suggested
Amory
.
``
Tell
'em

're
wild

have
'em
reform

an

*NL*
*NL*
Kerry
shook
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

wrote
a
St.
Timothy
girl
a
really
loving
letter
last
year

In
one
place
I
got
rattled
and
said
:

My
God

how
I
love

She
took
*NL*
a
nail
scissors
,
clipped
out
the
`
My
God
'
and
showed
the
rest
of
the
*NL*
letter
all
over
school
.
Does
n't
work
at
all

I
'm
just
`
good
old
Kerry

*NL*
and
all
that
rot

''
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
smiled
and
tried
to
picture
himself
as
``
good
old
Amory
.
''
He
failed
*NL*
completely
.
*NL*
*NL*
February
dripped
snow
and
rain
,
the
cyclonic
freshman
mid-years
passed
,
*NL*
and
life
in
12
Univee
continued
interesting
if
not
purposeful
.
Once
a
*NL*
day
Amory
indulged
in
a
club
sandwich
,
cornflakes
,
and
Julienne
potatoes
*NL*
at
``
Joe
's
,
''
accompanied
usually
by
Kerry
or
Alec
Connage
.
The
latter
was
*NL*
a
quiet
,
rather
aloof
slicker
from
Hotchkiss
,
who
lived
next
door
and
*NL*
shared
the
same
enforced
singleness
as
Amory
,
due
to
the
fact
that
*NL*
his
entire
class
had
gone
to
Yale
.
``
Joe
's
''
was
unaesthetic
and
faintly
*NL*
unsanitary
,
but
a
limitless
charge
account
could
be
opened
there
,
a
*NL*
convenience
that
Amory
appreciated
.
His
father
had
been
experimenting
*NL*
with
mining
stocks
and
,
in
consequence
,
his
allowance
,
while
liberal
,
*NL*
was
not
at
all
what
he
had
expected
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Joe
's
''
had
the
additional
advantage
of
seclusion
from
curious
*NL*
upper-class
eyes
,
so
at
four
each
afternoon
Amory
,
accompanied
by
friend
*NL*
or
book
,
went
up
to
experiment
with
his
digestion
.
One
day
in
March
,
*NL*
finding
that
all
the
tables
were
occupied
,
he
slipped
into
a
chair
*NL*
opposite
a
freshman
who
bent
intently
over
a
book
at
the
last
table
.
*NL*
They
nodded
briefly
.
For
twenty
minutes
Amory
sat
consuming
bacon
buns
*NL*
and
reading
``
Mrs.
Warren
's
Profession
''
-LRB-
he
had
discovered
Shaw
quite
*NL*
by
accident
while
browsing
in
the
library
during
mid-years
-RRB-
;
the
other
*NL*
freshman
,
also
intent
on
his
volume
,
meanwhile
did
away
with
a
trio
of
*NL*
chocolate
malted
milks
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
and
by
Amory
's
eyes
wandered
curiously
to
his
fellow-luncher
's
book
.
*NL*
He
spelled
out
the
name
and
title
upside
down
--
``
Marpessa
,
''
by
Stephen
*NL*
Phillips
.
This
meant
nothing
to
him
,
his
metrical
education
having
been
*NL*
confined
to
such
Sunday
classics
as
``
Come
into
the
Garden
,
Maude
,
''
and
*NL*
what
morsels
of
Shakespeare
and
Milton
had
been
recently
forced
upon
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Moved
to
address
his
vis-a-vis
,
he
simulated
interest
in
his
book
for
a
*NL*
moment
,
and
then
exclaimed
aloud
as
if
involuntarily
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ha
!
Great
stuff
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
other
freshman
looked
up
and
Amory
registered
artificial
*NL*
embarrassment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
referring
to
your
bacon
buns
?
''
His
cracked
,
kindly
voice
*NL*
went
well
with
the
large
spectacles
and
the
impression
of
a
voluminous
*NL*
keenness
that
he
gave
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
Amory
answered
.
``
I
was
referring
to
Bernard
Shaw
.
''
He
turned
the
*NL*
book
around
in
explanation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
never
read
any
Shaw
.
I
've
always
meant
to
.
''
The
boy
paused
and
*NL*
then
continued
:
``
Did
you
ever
read
Stephen
Phillips
,
or
do
you
like
*NL*
poetry
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
indeed
,
''
Amory
affirmed
eagerly
.
``
I
've
never
read
much
of
*NL*
Phillips
,
though
.
''
-LRB-
He
had
never
heard
of
any
Phillips
except
the
late
*NL*
David
Graham
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
pretty
fair
,
I
think
.
Of
course
he
's
a
Victorian
.
''
They
sallied
*NL*
into
a
discussion
of
poetry
,
in
the
course
of
which
they
introduced
*NL*
themselves
,
and
Amory
's
companion
proved
to
be
none
other
than
``
that
*NL*
awful
highbrow
,
Thomas
Parke
D'Invilliers
,
''
who
signed
the
passionate
*NL*
love-poems
in
the
Lit
.
He
was
,
perhaps
,
nineteen
,
with
stooped
*NL*
shoulders
,
pale
blue
eyes
,
and
,
as
Amory
could
tell
from
his
general
*NL*
appearance
,
without
much
conception
of
social
competition
and
such
*NL*
phenomena
of
absorbing
interest
.
Still
,
he
liked
books
,
and
it
seemed
*NL*
forever
since
Amory
had
met
any
one
who
did
;
if
only
that
St.
Paul
's
*NL*
crowd
at
the
next
table
would
not
mistake
_
him
_
for
a
bird
,
too
,
he
*NL*
would
enjoy
the
encounter
tremendously
.
They
did
n't
seem
to
be
noticing
,
*NL*
so
he
let
himself
go
,
discussed
books
by
the
dozens
--
books
he
had
read
,
*NL*
read
about
,
books
he
had
never
heard
of
,
rattling
off
lists
of
titles
*NL*
with
the
facility
of
a
Brentano
's
clerk
.
D'Invilliers
was
partially
*NL*
taken
in
and
wholly
delighted
.
In
a
good-natured
way
he
had
almost
*NL*
decided
that
Princeton
was
one
part
deadly
Philistines
and
one
part
*NL*
deadly
grinds
,
and
to
find
a
person
who
could
mention
Keats
without
*NL*
stammering
,
yet
evidently
washed
his
hands
,
was
rather
a
treat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ever
read
any
Oscar
Wilde
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
Who
wrote
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
man
--
do
n't
you
know
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
surely
.
''
A
faint
chord
was
struck
in
Amory
's
memory
.
``
Was
n't
the
*NL*
comic
opera
,
`
Patience
,
'
written
about
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
that
's
the
fella
.
I
've
just
finished
a
book
of
his
,
`
The
Picture
*NL*
of
Dorian
Gray
,
'
and
I
certainly
wish
you
'd
read
it
.
You
'd
like
it
.
You
*NL*
can
borrow
it
if
you
want
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
I
'd
like
it
a
lot
--
thanks
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
want
to
come
up
to
the
room
?
I
've
got
a
few
other
books
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
hesitated
,
glanced
at
the
St.
Paul
's
group
--
one
of
them
was
the
*NL*
magnificent
,
exquisite
Humbird
--
and
he
considered
how
determinate
the
*NL*
addition
of
this
friend
would
be
.
He
never
got
to
the
stage
of
making
*NL*
them
and
getting
rid
of
them
--
he
was
not
hard
enough
for
that
--
so
he
*NL*
measured
Thomas
Parke
D'Invilliers
'
undoubted
attractions
and
value
*NL*
against
the
menace
of
cold
eyes
behind
tortoise-rimmed
spectacles
that
*NL*
he
fancied
glared
from
the
next
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
'll
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
he
found
``
Dorian
Gray
''
and
the
``
Mystic
and
Somber
Dolores
''
and
the
*NL*
``
Belle
Dame
sans
Merci
''
;
for
a
month
was
keen
on
naught
else
.
The
world
*NL*
became
pale
and
interesting
,
and
he
tried
hard
to
look
at
Princeton
*NL*
through
the
satiated
eyes
of
Oscar
Wilde
and
Swinburne
--
or
``
Fingal
*NL*
O'Flaherty
''
and
``
Algernon
Charles
,
''
as
he
called
them
in
precieuse
jest
.
*NL*
He
read
enormously
every
night
--
Shaw
,
Chesterton
,
Barrie
,
Pinero
,
Yeats
,
*NL*
Synge
,
Ernest
Dowson
,
Arthur
Symons
,
Keats
,
Sudermann
,
Robert
Hugh
*NL*
Benson
,
the
Savoy
Operas
--
just
a
heterogeneous
mixture
,
for
he
suddenly
*NL*
discovered
that
he
had
read
nothing
for
years
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
D'Invilliers
became
at
first
an
occasion
rather
than
a
friend
.
Amory
*NL*
saw
him
about
once
a
week
,
and
together
they
gilded
the
ceiling
of
*NL*
Tom
's
room
and
decorated
the
walls
with
imitation
tapestry
,
bought
at
*NL*
an
auction
,
tall
candlesticks
and
figured
curtains
.
Amory
liked
him
for
*NL*
being
clever
and
literary
without
effeminacy
or
affectation
.
In
fact
,
*NL*
Amory
did
most
of
the
strutting
and
tried
painfully
to
make
every
remark
*NL*
an
epigram
,
than
which
,
if
one
is
content
with
ostensible
epigrams
,
*NL*
there
are
many
feats
harder
.
12
Univee
was
amused
.
Kerry
read
``
Dorian
*NL*
Gray
''
and
simulated
Lord
Henry
,
following
Amory
about
,
addressing
him
*NL*
as
``
Dorian
''
and
pretending
to
encourage
in
him
wicked
fancies
and
*NL*
attenuated
tendencies
to
ennui
.
When
he
carried
it
into
Commons
,
to
the
*NL*
amazement
of
the
others
at
table
,
Amory
became
furiously
embarrassed
,
*NL*
and
after
that
made
epigrams
only
before
D'Invilliers
or
a
convenient
*NL*
mirror
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
Tom
and
Amory
tried
reciting
their
own
and
Lord
Dunsany
's
poems
*NL*
to
the
music
of
Kerry
's
graphophone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Chant
!
''
cried
Tom
.
``
Do
n't
recite
!
Chant
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
,
who
was
performing
,
looked
annoyed
,
and
claimed
that
he
needed
*NL*
a
record
with
less
piano
in
it
.
Kerry
thereupon
rolled
on
the
floor
in
*NL*
stifled
laughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Put
on
`
Hearts
and
Flowers
'
!
''
he
howled
.
``
Oh
,
my
Lord
,
I
'm
going
to
*NL*
cast
a
kitten
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shut
off
the
damn
graphophone
,
''
Amory
cried
,
rather
red
in
the
face
.
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
giving
an
exhibition
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meanwhile
Amory
delicately
kept
trying
to
awaken
a
sense
of
the
*NL*
social
system
in
D'Invilliers
,
for
he
knew
that
this
poet
was
really
*NL*
more
conventional
than
he
,
and
needed
merely
watered
hair
,
a
smaller
*NL*
range
of
conversation
,
and
a
darker
brown
hat
to
become
quite
regular
.
*NL*
But
the
liturgy
of
Livingstone
collars
and
dark
ties
fell
on
heedless
*NL*
ears
;
in
fact
D'Invilliers
faintly
resented
his
efforts
;
so
Amory
*NL*
confined
himself
to
calls
once
a
week
,
and
brought
him
occasionally
to
*NL*
12
Univee
.
This
caused
mild
titters
among
the
other
freshmen
,
who
called
*NL*
them
``
Doctor
Johnson
and
Boswell
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alec
Connage
,
another
frequent
visitor
,
liked
him
in
a
vague
way
,
but
*NL*
was
afraid
of
him
as
a
highbrow
.
Kerry
,
who
saw
through
his
poetic
*NL*
patter
to
the
solid
,
almost
respectable
depths
within
,
was
immensely
*NL*
amused
and
would
have
him
recite
poetry
by
the
hour
,
while
he
lay
with
*NL*
closed
eyes
on
Amory
's
sofa
and
listened
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Asleep
or
waking
is
it
?
for
her
neck
*NL*
Kissed
over
close
,
wears
yet
a
purple
speck
*NL*
Wherein
the
pained
blood
falters
and
goes
out
;
*NL*
Soft
and
stung
softly
--
fairer
for
a
fleck
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
good
,
''
Kerry
would
say
softly
.
``
It
pleases
the
elder
Holiday
.
*NL*
That
's
a
great
poet
,
I
guess
.
''
Tom
,
delighted
at
an
audience
,
would
*NL*
ramble
through
the
``
Poems
and
Ballades
''
until
Kerry
and
Amory
knew
them
*NL*
almost
as
well
as
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
took
to
writing
poetry
on
spring
afternoons
,
in
the
gardens
of
the
*NL*
big
estates
near
Princeton
,
while
swans
made
effective
atmosphere
in
the
*NL*
artificial
pools
,
and
slow
clouds
sailed
harmoniously
above
the
willows
.
*NL*
May
came
too
soon
,
and
suddenly
unable
to
bear
walls
,
he
wandered
the
*NL*
campus
at
all
hours
through
starlight
and
rain
.

*NL*
A
DAMP
SYMBOLIC
INTERLUDE
*NL*
*NL*
The
night
mist
fell
.
From
the
moon
it
rolled
,
clustered
about
the
spires
*NL*
and
towers
,
and
then
settled
below
them
,
so
that
the
dreaming
peaks
were
*NL*
still
in
lofty
aspiration
toward
the
sky
.
Figures
that
dotted
the
*NL*
day
like
ants
now
brushed
along
as
shadowy
ghosts
,
in
and
out
of
*NL*
the
foreground
.
The
Gothic
halls
and
cloisters
were
infinitely
more
*NL*
mysterious
as
they
loomed
suddenly
out
of
the
darkness
,
outlined
each
by
*NL*
myriad
faint
squares
of
yellow
light
.
Indefinitely
from
somewhere
a
bell
*NL*
boomed
the
quarter-hour
,
and
Amory
,
pausing
by
the
sun-dial
,
stretched
*NL*
himself
out
full
length
on
the
damp
grass
.
The
cool
bathed
his
eyes
and
*NL*
slowed
the
flight
of
time
--
time
that
had
crept
so
insidiously
through
*NL*
the
lazy
April
afternoons
,
seemed
so
intangible
in
the
long
spring
*NL*
twilights
.
Evening
after
evening
the
senior
singing
had
drifted
over
the
*NL*
campus
in
melancholy
beauty
,
and
through
the
shell
of
his
undergraduate
*NL*
consciousness
had
broken
a
deep
and
reverent
devotion
to
the
gray
walls
*NL*
and
Gothic
peaks
and
all
they
symbolized
as
warehouses
of
dead
ages
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
tower
that
in
view
of
his
window
sprang
upward
,
grew
into
a
spire
,
*NL*
yearning
higher
until
its
uppermost
tip
was
half
invisible
against
*NL*
the
morning
skies
,
gave
him
the
first
sense
of
the
transiency
and
*NL*
unimportance
of
the
campus
figures
except
as
holders
of
the
apostolic
*NL*
succession
.
He
liked
knowing
that
Gothic
architecture
,
with
its
upward
*NL*
trend
,
was
peculiarly
appropriate
to
universities
,
and
the
idea
became
*NL*
personal
to
him
.
The
silent
stretches
of
green
,
the
quiet
halls
with
*NL*
an
occasional
late-burning
scholastic
light
held
his
imagination
in
*NL*
a
strong
grasp
,
and
the
chastity
of
the
spire
became
a
symbol
of
this
*NL*
perception
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Damn
it
all
,
''
he
whispered
aloud
,
wetting
his
hands
in
the
damp
and
*NL*
running
them
through
his
hair
.
``
Next
year
I
work
!
''
Yet
he
knew
that
*NL*
where
now
the
spirit
of
spires
and
towers
made
him
dreamily
acquiescent
,
*NL*
it
would
then
overawe
him
.
Where
now
he
realized
only
his
own
*NL*
inconsequence
,
effort
would
make
him
aware
of
his
own
impotency
and
*NL*
insufficiency
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
college
dreamed
on
--
awake
.
He
felt
a
nervous
excitement
that
might
*NL*
have
been
the
very
throb
of
its
slow
heart
.
It
was
a
stream
where
he
was
*NL*
to
throw
a
stone
whose
faint
ripple
would
be
vanishing
almost
as
it
left
*NL*
his
hand
.
As
yet
he
had
given
nothing
,
he
had
taken
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
belated
freshman
,
his
oilskin
slicker
rasping
loudly
,
slushed
along
*NL*
the
soft
path
.
A
voice
from
somewhere
called
the
inevitable
formula
,
*NL*
``
Stick
out
your
head
!
''
below
an
unseen
window
.
A
hundred
little
sounds
*NL*
of
the
current
drifting
on
under
the
fog
pressed
in
finally
on
his
*NL*
consciousness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
God
!
''
he
cried
suddenly
,
and
started
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
*NL*
in
the
stillness
.
The
rain
dripped
on
.
A
minute
longer
he
lay
without
*NL*
moving
,
his
hands
clinched
.
Then
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
gave
his
*NL*
clothes
a
tentative
pat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
very
damn
wet
!
''
he
said
aloud
to
the
sun-dial
.

HISTORICAL

The

began

summer
following

freshman
year
.
Beyond
a
*NL*
sporting
interest
in
the
German
dash
for
Paris
the
whole
affair
failed
*NL*
either
to
thrill
or
interest
him
.
With
the
attitude
he
might
have
held
*NL*
toward
an
amusing
melodrama
he
hoped
it
would
be
long
and
bloody
.
If
it

he
would
have
felt
like
an
irate
ticket-holder
at
a

A

seething
ant-hill
was
the

It
gave

comedy
every

travelling
with
cast

chorus

orchestra

and

*NL*
all
through

The
play

were
the
work

of
undergraduates

the
club
itself
was
the
most
influential
of

over
three

Every

those
damn
milkmaid
costumes
''
;
the
old
graduate
,
president
in
*NL*
ninety-eight
,
perches
on
a
box
and
thinks
how
much
simpler
it
was
in
his
*NL*
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
a
Triangle
show
ever
got
off
was
a
mystery
,
but
it
was
a
riotous
*NL*
mystery
,
anyway
,
whether
or
not
one
did
enough
service
to
wear
a
little
*NL*
gold
Triangle
on
his
watch-chain
.
``
Ha-Ha
Hortense
!
''
was
written
over
*NL*
six
times
and
had
the
names
of
nine
collaborators
on
the
programme
.
All
*NL*
Triangle
shows
started
by
being
``
something
different
--
not
just
a
regular
*NL*
musical
comedy
,
''
but
when
the
several
authors
,
the
president
,
the
coach
*NL*
and
the
faculty
committee
finished
with
it
,
there
remained
just
the
old
*NL*
reliable
Triangle
show
with
the
old
reliable
jokes
and
the
star
comedian
*NL*
who
got
expelled
or
sick
or
something
just
before
the
trip
,
and
the
*NL*
dark-whiskered
man
in
the
pony-ballet
,
who
``
absolutely
wo
n't
shave
twice
*NL*
a
day
,
doggone
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
one
brilliant
place
in
``
Ha-Ha
Hortense
!
''
It
is
a
Princeton
*NL*
tradition
that
whenever
a
Yale
man
who
is
a
member
of
the
widely
*NL*
advertised
``
Skull
and
Bones
''
hears
the
sacred
name
mentioned
,
he
must
*NL*
leave
the
room
.
It
is
also
a
tradition
that
the
members
are
invariably
*NL*
successful
in
later
life
,
amassing
fortunes
or
votes
or
coupons
or
*NL*
whatever
they
choose
to
amass
.
Therefore
,
at
each
performance
of
``
Ha-Ha
*NL*
Hortense
!
''
half-a-dozen
seats
were
kept
from
sale
and
occupied
by
six
*NL*
of
the
worst-looking
vagabonds
that
could
be
hired
from
the
streets
,
*NL*
further
touched
up
by
the
Triangle
make-up
man
.
At
the
moment
in
the
*NL*
show
where
Firebrand
,
the
Pirate
Chief
,
pointed
at
his
black
flag
and
*NL*
said
,
``
I
am
a
Yale
graduate
--
note
my
Skull
and
Bones
!
''
--
at
this
very
*NL*
moment
the
six
vagabonds
were
instructed
to
rise
_
conspicuously
_
and
*NL*
leave
the
theatre
with
looks
of
deep
melancholy
and
an
injured
dignity
.
*NL*
It
was
claimed
though
never
proved
that
on
one
occasion
the
hired
Elis
*NL*
were
swelled
by
one
of
the
real
thing
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
played
through
vacation
to
the
fashionable
of
eight
cities
.
Amory
*NL*
liked
Louisville
and
Memphis
best
:
these
knew
how
to
meet
strangers
,
*NL*
furnished
extraordinary
punch
,
and
flaunted
an
astonishing
array
*NL*
of
feminine
beauty
.
Chicago
he
approved
for
a
certain
verve
that
*NL*
transcended
its
loud
accent
--
however
,
it
was
a
Yale
town
,
and
as
the
*NL*
Yale
Glee
Club
was
expected
in
a
week
the
Triangle
received
only
divided
*NL*
homage
.
In
Baltimore
,
Princeton
was
at
home
,
and
every
one
fell
in
love
.
*NL*
There
was
a
proper
consumption
of
strong
waters
all
along
the
line
;
one
*NL*
man
invariably
went
on
the
stage
highly
stimulated
,
claiming
that
his
*NL*
particular
interpretation
of
the
part
required
it
.
There
were
three
*NL*
private
cars
;
however
,
no
one
slept
except
in
the
third
car
,
which
*NL*
was
called
the
``
animal
car
,
''
and
where
were
herded
the
spectacled
*NL*
wind-jammers
of
the
orchestra
.
Everything
was
so
hurried
that
there
*NL*
was
no
time
to
be
bored
,
but
when
they
arrived
in
Philadelphia
,
with
*NL*
vacation
nearly
over
,
there
was
rest
in
getting
out
of
the
heavy
*NL*
atmosphere
of
flowers
and
grease-paint
,
and
the
ponies
took
off
their
*NL*
corsets
with
abdominal
pains
and
sighs
of
relief
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
disbanding
came
,
Amory
set
out
post
haste
for
Minneapolis
,
for
*NL*
Sally
Weatherby
's
cousin
,
Isabelle
Borge
,
was
coming
to
spend
the
winter
*NL*
in
Minneapolis
while
her
parents
went
abroad
.
He
remembered
Isabelle
*NL*
only
as
a
little
girl
with
whom
he
had
played
sometimes
when
he
first
*NL*
went
to
Minneapolis
.
She
had
gone
to
Baltimore
to
live
--
but
since
then
*NL*
she
had
developed
a
past
.
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
was
in
full
stride
,
confident
,
nervous
,
and
jubilant
.
Scurrying
*NL*
back
to
Minneapolis
to
see
a
girl
he
had
known
as
a
child
seemed
the
*NL*
interesting
and
romantic
thing
to
do
,
so
without
compunction
he
wired
*NL*
his
mother
not
to
expect
him
...
sat
in
the
train
,
and
thought
about
*NL*
himself
for
thirty-six
hours
.

``
PETTING
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
Triangle
trip
Amory
had
come
into
constant
contact
with
that
*NL*
great
current
American
phenomenon
,
the
``
petting
party
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
None
of
the
Victorian
mothers
--
and
most
of
the
mothers
were
*NL*
Victorian
--
had
any
idea
how
casually
their
daughters
were
accustomed
to
*NL*
be
kissed
.
``
Servant-girls
are
that
way
,
''
says
Mrs.
Huston-Carmelite
to
*NL*
her
popular
daughter
.
``
They
are
kissed
first
and
proposed
to
afterward
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
Popular
Daughter
becomes
engaged
every
six
months
between
*NL*
sixteen
and
twenty-two
,
when
she
arranges
a
match
with
young
Hambell
,
of
*NL*
Cambell
&
Hambell
,
who
fatuously
considers
himself
her
first
love
,
and
*NL*
between
engagements
the
P.
D.
-LRB-
she
is
selected
by
the
cut-in
system
at
*NL*
dances
,
which
favors
the
survival
of
the
fittest
-RRB-
has
other
sentimental
*NL*
last
kisses
in
the
moonlight
,
or
the
firelight
,
or
the
outer
darkness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
saw
girls
doing
things
that
even
in
his
memory
would
have
been
*NL*
impossible
:
eating
three-o'clock
,
after-dance
suppers
in
impossible
*NL*
cafes
,
talking
of
every
side
of
life
with
an
air
half
of
earnestness
,
*NL*
half
of
mockery
,
yet
with
a
furtive
excitement
that
Amory
considered
*NL*
stood
for
a
real
moral
let-down
.
But
he
never
realized
how
wide-spread
*NL*
it
was
until
he
saw
the
cities
between
New
York
and
Chicago
as
one
vast
*NL*
juvenile
intrigue
.
*NL*
*NL*
Afternoon
at
the
Plaza
,
with
winter
twilight
hovering
outside
and
faint
*NL*
drums
down-stairs
...
they
strut
and
fret
in
the
lobby
,
taking
another
*NL*
cocktail
,
scrupulously
attired
and
waiting
.
Then
the
swinging
doors
*NL*
revolve
and
three
bundles
of
fur
mince
in
.
The
theatre
comes
afterward
;
*NL*
then
a
table
at
the
Midnight
Frolic
--
of
course
,
mother
will
be
along
*NL*
there
,
but
she
will
serve
only
to
make
things
more
secretive
and
*NL*
brilliant
as
she
sits
in
solitary
state
at
the
deserted
table
and
thinks
*NL*
such
entertainments
as
this
are
not
half
so
bad
as
they
are
painted
,
*NL*
only
rather
wearying
.
But
the
P.
D.
is
in
love
again
...
it
was
odd
,
*NL*
was
n't
it
?
--
that
though
there
was
so
much
room
left
in
the
taxi
the
P.
*NL*
D.
and
the
boy
from
Williams
were
somehow
crowded
out
and
had
to
go
in
a
*NL*
separate
car
.
Odd
!
Did
n't
you
notice
how
flushed
the
P.
D.
was
when
she
*NL*
arrived
just
seven
minutes
late
?
But
the
P.
D.
``
gets
away
with
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
``
belle
''
had
become
the
``
flirt
,
''
the
``
flirt
''
had
become
the
``
baby
*NL*
vamp
.
''
The
``
belle
''
had
five
or
six
callers
every
afternoon
.
If
the
P.
*NL*
D.
,
by
some
strange
accident
,
has
two
,
it
is
made
pretty
uncomfortable
*NL*
for
the
one
who
has
n't
a
date
with
her
.
The
``
belle
''
was
surrounded
by
*NL*
a
dozen
men
in
the
intermissions
between
dances
.
Try
to
find
the
P.
D.
*NL*
between
dances
,
just
_
try
_
to
find
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
same
girl
...
deep
in
an
atmosphere
of
jungle
music
and
the
*NL*
questioning
of
moral
codes
.
Amory
found
it
rather
fascinating
to
feel
*NL*
that
any
popular
girl
he
met
before
eight
he
might
quite
possibly
kiss
*NL*
before
twelve
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
on
earth
are
we
here
?
''
he
asked
the
girl
with
the
green
combs
one
*NL*
night
as
they
sat
in
some
one
's
limousine
,
outside
the
Country
Club
in
*NL*
Louisville
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
.
I
'm
just
full
of
the
devil
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
's
be
frank
--
we
'll
never
see
each
other
again
.
I
wanted
to
come
out
*NL*
here
with
you
because
I
thought
you
were
the
best-looking
girl
in
sight
.
*NL*
You
really
do
n't
care
whether
you
ever
see
me
again
,
do
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
but
is
this
your
line
for
every
girl
?
What
have
I
done
to
deserve
*NL*
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
did
n't
feel
tired
dancing
or
want
a
cigarette
or
any
of
the
*NL*
things
you
said
?
You
just
wanted
to
be
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
let
's
go
in
,
''
she
interrupted
,
``
if
you
want
to
_
analyze
_
.
Let
's
not
*NL*
_
talk
_
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
hand-knit
,
sleeveless
jerseys
were
stylish
,
Amory
,
in
a
burst
*NL*
of
inspiration
,
named
them
``
petting
shirts
.
''
The
name
travelled
from
*NL*
coast
to
coast
on
the
lips
of
parlor-snakes
and
P.
D.
's
.

DESCRIPTIVE
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
was
now
eighteen
years
old
,
just
under
six
feet
tall
and
*NL*
exceptionally
,
but
not
conventionally
,
handsome
.
He
had
rather
a
young
*NL*
face
,
the
ingenuousness
of
which
was
marred
by
the
penetrating
green
*NL*
eyes
,
fringed
with
long
dark
eyelashes
.
He
lacked
somehow
that
intense
*NL*
animal
magnetism
that
so
often
accompanies
beauty
in
men
or
women
;
his
*NL*
personality
seemed
rather
a
mental
thing
,
and
it
was
not
in
his
power
*NL*
to
turn
it
on
and
off
like
a
water-faucet
.
But
people
never
forgot
his
*NL*
face
.

*NL*
ISABELLE
*NL*
*NL*
She
paused
at
the
top
of
the
staircase
.
The
sensations
attributed
to
*NL*
divers
on
spring-boards
,
leading
ladies
on
opening
nights
,
and
lumpy
,
*NL*
husky
young
men
on
the
day
of
the
Big
Game
,
crowded
through
her
.
She
*NL*
should
have
descended
to
a
burst
of
drums
or
a
discordant
blend
of
*NL*
themes
from
``
Thais
''
and
``
Carmen
.
''
She
had
never
been
so
curious
about
*NL*
her
appearance
,
she
had
never
been
so
satisfied
with
it
.
She
had
been
*NL*
sixteen
years
old
for
six
months
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Isabelle
!
''
called
her
cousin
Sally
from
the
doorway
of
the
*NL*
dressing-room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
ready
.
''
She
caught
a
slight
lump
of
nervousness
in
her
throat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
to
send
back
to
the
house
for
another
pair
of
slippers
.
It
'll
be
*NL*
just
a
minute
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabelle
started
toward
the
dressing-room
for
a
last
peek
in
the
mirror
,
*NL*
but
something
decided
her
to
stand
there
and
gaze
down
the
broad
stairs
*NL*
of
the
Minnehaha
Club
.
They
curved
tantalizingly
,
and
she
could
catch
*NL*
just
a
glimpse
of
two
pairs
of
masculine
feet
in
the
hall
below
.
*NL*
Pump-shod
in
uniform
black
,
they
gave
no
hint
of
identity
,
but
she
*NL*
wondered
eagerly
if
one
pair
were
attached
to
Amory
Blaine
.
This
young
*NL*
man
,
not
as
yet
encountered
,
had
nevertheless
taken
up
a
considerable
*NL*
part
of
her
day
--
the
first
day
of
her
arrival
.
Coming
up
in
the
machine
*NL*
from
the
station
,
Sally
had
volunteered
,
amid
a
rain
of
question
,
*NL*
comment
,
revelation
,
and
exaggeration
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
remember
Amory
Blaine
,
of
_
course
_
.
Well
,
he
's
simply
mad
to
*NL*
see
you
again
.
He
's
stayed
over
a
day
from
college
,
and
he
's
coming
*NL*
to-night
.
He
's
heard
so
much
about
you
--
says
he
remembers
your
eyes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
had
pleased
Isabelle
.
It
put
them
on
equal
terms
,
although
she
*NL*
was
quite
capable
of
staging
her
own
romances
,
with
or
without
advance
*NL*
advertising
.
But
following
her
happy
tremble
of
anticipation
,
came
a
*NL*
sinking
sensation
that
made
her
ask
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
mean
he
's
heard
about
me
?
What
sort
of
things
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sally
smiled
.
She
felt
rather
in
the
capacity
of
a
showman
with
her
more
*NL*
exotic
cousin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
knows
you
're
--
you
're
considered
beautiful
and
all
that
''
--
she
*NL*
paused
--
``
and
I
guess
he
knows
you
've
been
kissed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
Isabelle
's
little
fist
had
clinched
suddenly
under
the
fur
robe
.
*NL*
She
was
accustomed
to
be
thus
followed
by
her
desperate
past
,
and
it
*NL*
never
failed
to
rouse
in
her
the
same
feeling
of
resentment
;
yet
--
in
a
*NL*
strange
town
it
was
an
advantageous
reputation
.
She
was
a
``
Speed
,
''
was
*NL*
she
?
Well
--
let
them
find
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
Out
of
the
window
Isabelle
watched
the
snow
glide
by
in
the
frosty
*NL*
morning
.
It
was
ever
so
much
colder
here
than
in
Baltimore
;
she
had
*NL*
not
remembered
;
the
glass
of
the
side
door
was
iced
,
the
windows
*NL*
were
shirred
with
snow
in
the
corners
.
Her
mind
played
still
with
one
*NL*
subject
.
Did
_
he
_
dress
like
that
boy
there
,
who
walked
calmly
down
a
*NL*
bustling
business
street
,
in
moccasins
and
winter-carnival
costume
?
How
*NL*
very
_
Western
!
_
Of
course
he
was
n't
that
way
:
he
went
to
Princeton
,
was
*NL*
a
sophomore
or
something
.
Really
she
had
no
distinct
idea
of
him
.
An
*NL*
ancient
snap-shot
she
had
preserved
in
an
old
kodak
book
had
impressed
*NL*
her
by
the
big
eyes
-LRB-
which
he
had
probably
grown
up
to
by
now
-RRB-
.
However
,
*NL*
in
the
last
month
,
when
her
winter
visit
to
Sally
had
been
decided
on
,
*NL*
he
had
assumed
the
proportions
of
a
worthy
adversary
.
Children
,
most
*NL*
astute
of
match-makers
,
plot
their
campaigns
quickly
,
and
Sally
*NL*
had
played
a
clever
correspondence
sonata
to
Isabelle
's
excitable
*NL*
temperament
.
Isabelle
had
been
for
some
time
capable
of
very
strong
,
if
*NL*
very
transient
emotions
...
*NL*
*NL*
They
drew
up
at
a
spreading
,
white-stone
building
,
set
back
from
the
*NL*
snowy
street
.
Mrs.
Weatherby
greeted
her
warmly
and
her
various
younger
*NL*
cousins
were
produced
from
the
corners
where
they
skulked
politely
.
*NL*
Isabelle
met
them
tactfully
.
At
her
best
she
allied
all
with
whom
she
*NL*
came
in
contact
--
except
older
girls
and
some
women
.
All
the
impressions
*NL*
she
made
were
conscious
.
The
half-dozen
girls
she
renewed
acquaintance
*NL*
with
that
morning
were
all
rather
impressed
and
as
much
by
her
direct
*NL*
personality
as
by
her
reputation
.
Amory
Blaine
was
an
open
subject
.
*NL*
Evidently
a
bit
light
of
love
,
neither
popular
nor
unpopular
--
every
girl
*NL*
there
seemed
to
have
had
an
affair
with
him
at
some
time
or
other
,
but
*NL*
no
one
volunteered
any
really
useful
information
.
He
was
going
to
fall
*NL*
for
her
...
Sally
had
published
that
information
to
her
young
set
*NL*
and
they
were
retailing
it
back
to
Sally
as
fast
as
they
set
eyes
on
*NL*
Isabelle
.
Isabelle
resolved
secretly
that
she
would
,
if
necessary
,
*NL*
_
force
_
herself
to
like
him
--
she
owed
it
to
Sally
.
Suppose
she
were
*NL*
terribly
disappointed
.
Sally
had
painted
him
in
such
glowing
colors
--
he
*NL*
was
good-looking
,
``
sort
of
distinguished
,
when
he
wants
to
be
,
''
had
a
*NL*
line
,
and
was
properly
inconstant
.
In
fact
,
he
summed
up
all
the
romance
*NL*
that
her
age
and
environment
led
her
to
desire
.
She
wondered
if
those
*NL*
were
his
dancing-shoes
that
fox-trotted
tentatively
around
the
soft
rug
*NL*
below
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
impressions
and
,
in
fact
,
all
ideas
were
extremely
kaleidoscopic
to
*NL*
Isabelle
.
She
had
that
curious
mixture
of
the
social
and
the
artistic
*NL*
temperaments
found
often
in
two
classes
,
society
women
and
actresses
.
*NL*
Her
education
or
,
rather
,
her
sophistication
,
had
been
absorbed
from
*NL*
the
boys
who
had
dangled
on
her
favor
;
her
tact
was
instinctive
,
and
*NL*
her
capacity
for
love-affairs
was
limited
only
by
the
number
of
the
*NL*
susceptible
within
telephone
distance
.
Flirt
smiled
from
her
large
*NL*
black-brown
eyes
and
shone
through
her
intense
physical
magnetism
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
she
waited
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
that
evening
while
slippers
*NL*
were
fetched
.
Just
as
she
was
growing
impatient
,
Sally
came
out
of
the
*NL*
dressing-room
,
beaming
with
her
accustomed
good
nature
and
high
spirits
,
*NL*
and
together
they
descended
to
the
floor
below
,
while
the
shifting
*NL*
search-light
of
Isabelle
's
mind
flashed
on
two
ideas
:
she
was
glad
she
*NL*
had
high
color
to-night
,
and
she
wondered
if
he
danced
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
Down-stairs
,
in
the
club
's
great
room
,
she
was
surrounded
for
a
moment
*NL*
by
the
girls
she
had
met
in
the
afternoon
,
then
she
heard
Sally
's
voice
*NL*
repeating
a
cycle
of
names
,
and
found
herself
bowing
to
a
sextet
of
*NL*
black
and
white
,
terribly
stiff
,
vaguely
familiar
figures
.
The
name
*NL*
Blaine
figured
somewhere
,
but
at
first
she
could
not
place
him
.
A
*NL*
very
confused
,
very
juvenile
moment
of
awkward
backings
and
bumpings
*NL*
followed
,
and
every
one
found
himself
talking
to
the
person
he
least
*NL*
desired
to
.
Isabelle
manoeuvred
herself
and
Froggy
Parker
,
freshman
*NL*
at
Harvard
,
with
whom
she
had
once
played
hop-scotch
,
to
a
seat
on
the
*NL*
stairs
.
A
humorous
reference
to
the
past
was
all
she
needed
.
The
things
*NL*
Isabelle
could
do
socially
with
one
idea
were
remarkable
.
First
,
she
*NL*
repeated
it
rapturously
in
an
enthusiastic
contralto
with
a
soupcon
*NL*
of
Southern
accent
;
then
she
held
it
off
at
a
distance
and
smiled
at
*NL*
it
--
her
wonderful
smile
;
then
she
delivered
it
in
variations
and
*NL*
played
a
sort
of
mental
catch
with
it
,
all
this
in
the
nominal
form
*NL*
of
dialogue
.
Froggy
was
fascinated
and
quite
unconscious
that
this
was
*NL*
being
done
,
not
for
him
,
but
for
the
green
eyes
that
glistened
under
the
*NL*
shining
carefully
watered
hair
,
a
little
to
her
left
,
for
Isabelle
had
*NL*
discovered
Amory
.
As
an
actress
even
in
the
fullest
flush
of
her
own
*NL*
conscious
magnetism
gets
a
deep
impression
of
most
of
the
people
in
the
*NL*
front
row
,
so
Isabelle
sized
up
her
antagonist
.
First
,
he
had
auburn
*NL*
hair
,
and
from
her
feeling
of
disappointment
she
knew
that
she
had
*NL*
expected
him
to
be
dark
and
of
garter-advertisement
slenderness
...
For
*NL*
the
rest
,
a
faint
flush
and
a
straight
,
romantic
profile
;
the
effect
set
*NL*
off
by
a
close-fitting
dress
suit
and
a
silk
ruffled
shirt
of
the
kind
*NL*
that
women
still
delight
to
see
men
wear
,
but
men
were
just
beginning
to
*NL*
get
tired
of
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
this
inspection
Amory
was
quietly
watching
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
_
you
_
think
so
?
''
she
said
suddenly
,
turning
to
him
,
*NL*
innocent-eyed
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
stir
,
and
Sally
led
the
way
over
to
their
table
.
Amory
*NL*
struggled
to
Isabelle
's
side
,
and
whispered
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
my
dinner
partner
,
you
know
.
We
're
all
coached
for
each
other
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabelle
gasped
--
this
was
rather
right
in
line
.
But
really
she
felt
*NL*
as
if
a
good
speech
had
been
taken
from
the
star
and
given
to
a
minor
*NL*
character
...
She
must
n't
lose
the
leadership
a
bit
.
The
dinner-table
*NL*
glittered
with
laughter
at
the
confusion
of
getting
places
and
then
*NL*
curious
eyes
were
turned
on
her
,
sitting
near
the
head
.
She
was
enjoying
*NL*
this
immensely
,
and
Froggy
Parker
was
so
engrossed
with
the
added
*NL*
sparkle
of
her
rising
color
that
he
forgot
to
pull
out
Sally
's
chair
,
*NL*
and
fell
into
a
dim
confusion
.
Amory
was
on
the
other
side
,
full
of
*NL*
confidence
and
vanity
,
gazing
at
her
in
open
admiration
.
He
began
*NL*
directly
,
and
so
did
Froggy
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
heard
a
lot
about
you
since
you
wore
braids
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
n't
it
funny
this
afternoon
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Both
stopped
.
Isabelle
turned
to
Amory
shyly
.
Her
face
was
always
enough
*NL*
answer
for
any
one
,
but
she
decided
to
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
--
from
whom
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
everybody
--
for
all
the
years
since
you
've
been
away
.
''
She
blushed
*NL*
appropriately
.
On
her
right
Froggy
was
_
hors
de
combat
_
already
,
*NL*
although
he
had
n't
quite
realized
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
tell
you
what
I
remembered
about
you
all
these
years
,
''
Amory
*NL*
continued
.
She
leaned
slightly
toward
him
and
looked
modestly
at
the
*NL*
celery
before
her
.
Froggy
sighed
--
he
knew
Amory
,
and
the
situations
that
*NL*
Amory
seemed
born
to
handle
.
He
turned
to
Sally
and
asked
her
if
she
was
*NL*
going
away
to
school
next
year
.
Amory
opened
with
grape-shot
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
got
an
adjective
that
just
fits
you
.
''
This
was
one
of
his
favorite
*NL*
starts
--
he
seldom
had
a
word
in
mind
,
but
it
was
a
curiosity
provoker
,
*NL*
and
he
could
always
produce
something
complimentary
if
he
got
in
a
tight
*NL*
corner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
--
what
?
''
Isabelle
's
face
was
a
study
in
enraptured
curiosity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
shook
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
you
very
well
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
tell
me
--
afterward
?
''
she
half
whispered
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
nodded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
'll
sit
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabelle
nodded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
any
one
ever
tell
you
,
you
have
keen
eyes
?
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
attempted
to
make
them
look
even
keener
.
He
fancied
,
but
he
was
*NL*
not
sure
,
that
her
foot
had
just
touched
his
under
the
table
.
But
it
*NL*
might
possibly
have
been
only
the
table
leg
.
It
was
so
hard
to
tell
.
*NL*
Still
it
thrilled
him
.
He
wondered
quickly
if
there
would
be
any
*NL*
difficulty
in
securing
the
little
den
up-stairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
*****
*NL*
*NL*
BABES
IN
THE
WOODS
*NL*
*NL*
Isabelle
and
Amory
were
distinctly
not
innocent
,
nor
were
they
*NL*
particularly
brazen
.
Moreover
,
amateur
standing
had
very
little
value
*NL*
in
the
game
they
were
playing
,
a
game
that
would
presumably
be
her
*NL*
principal
study
for
years
to
come
.
She
had
begun
as
he
had
,
with
good
*NL*
looks
and
an
excitable
temperament
,
and
the
rest
was
the
result
of
*NL*
accessible
popular
novels
and
dressing-room
conversation
culled
from
a
*NL*
slightly
older
set
.
Isabelle
had
walked
with
an
artificial
gait
at
nine
*NL*
and
a
half
,
and
when
her
eyes
,
wide
and
starry
,
proclaimed
the
ingenue
*NL*
most
.
Amory
was
proportionately
less
deceived
.
He
waited
for
the
mask
to
*NL*
drop
off
,
but
at
the
same
time
he
did
not
question
her
right
to
wear
*NL*
it
.
She
,
on
her
part
,
was
not
impressed
by
his
studied
air
of
blase
*NL*
sophistication
.
She
had
lived
in
a
larger
city
and
had
slightly
an
*NL*
advantage
in
range
.
But
she
accepted
his
pose
--
it
was
one
of
the
dozen
*NL*
little
conventions
of
this
kind
of
affair
.
He
was
aware
that
he
was
*NL*
getting
this
particular
favor
now
because
she
had
been
coached
;
he
knew
*NL*
that
he
stood
for
merely
the
best
game
in
sight
,
and
that
he
would
*NL*
have
to
improve
his
opportunity
before
he
lost
his
advantage
.
So
they
*NL*
proceeded
with
an
infinite
guile
that
would
have
horrified
her
parents
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
dinner
the
dance
began
...
smoothly
.
Smoothly
?
--
boys
cut
in
*NL*
on
Isabelle
every
few
feet
and
then
squabbled
in
the
corners
with
:
``
You
*NL*
might
let
me
get
more
than
an
inch
!
''
and
``
She
did
n't
like
it
either
--
she
*NL*
told
me
so
next
time
I
cut
in
.
''
It
was
true
--
she
told
every
one
so
,
and
*NL*
gave
every
hand
a
parting
pressure
that
said
:
``
You
know
that
your
dances
*NL*
are
_
making
_
my
evening
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
time
passed
,
two
hours
of
it
,
and
the
less
subtle
beaux
had
better
*NL*
learned
to
focus
their
pseudo-passionate
glances
elsewhere
,
for
eleven
*NL*
o'clock
found
Isabelle
and
Amory
sitting
on
the
couch
in
the
little
*NL*
den
off
the
reading-room
up-stairs
.
She
was
conscious
that
they
were
*NL*
a
handsome
pair
,
and
seemed
to
belong
distinctively
in
this
seclusion
,
*NL*
while
lesser
lights
fluttered
and
chattered
down-stairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Boys
who
passed
the
door
looked
in
enviously
--
girls
who
passed
only
*NL*
laughed
and
frowned
and
grew
wise
within
themselves
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
now
reached
a
very
definite
stage
.
They
had
traded
accounts
of
*NL*
their
progress
since
they
had
met
last
,
and
she
had
listened
to
much
*NL*
she
had
heard
before
.
He
was
a
sophomore
,
was
on
the
Princetonian
board
,
*NL*
hoped
to
be
chairman
in
senior
year
.
He
learned
that
some
of
the
boys
*NL*
she
went
with
in
Baltimore
were
``
terrible
speeds
''
and
came
to
dances
in
*NL*
states
of
artificial
stimulation
;
most
of
them
were
twenty
or
so
,
and
*NL*
drove
alluring
red
Stutzes
.
A
good
half
seemed
to
have
already
flunked
*NL*
out
of
various
schools
and
colleges
,
but
some
of
them
bore
athletic
*NL*
names
that
made
him
look
at
her
admiringly
.
As
a
matter
of
fact
,
*NL*
Isabelle
's
closer
acquaintance
with
the
universities
was
just
*NL*
commencing
.
She
had
bowing
acquaintance
with
a
lot
of
young
men
who
*NL*
thought
she
was
a
``
pretty
kid
--
worth
keeping
an
eye
on
.
''
But
Isabelle
*NL*
strung
the
names
into
a
fabrication
of
gayety
that
would
have
dazzled
*NL*
a
Viennese
nobleman
.
Such
is
the
power
of
young
contralto
voices
on
*NL*
sink-down
sofas
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
asked
her
if
she
thought
he
was
conceited
.
She
said
there
was
*NL*
a
difference
between
conceit
and
self-confidence
.
She
adored
*NL*
self-confidence
in
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
Froggy
a
good
friend
of
yours
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rather
--
why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
a
bum
dancer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
dances
as
if
the
girl
were
on
his
back
instead
of
in
his
arms
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
appreciated
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
awfully
good
at
sizing
people
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
denied
this
painfully
.
However
,
he
sized
up
several
people
for
*NL*
her
.
Then
they
talked
about
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
got
awfully
nice
hands
,
''
she
said
.
``
They
look
as
if
you
played
*NL*
the
piano
.
Do
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
said
they
had
reached
a
very
definite
stage
--
nay
,
more
,
a
very
*NL*
critical
stage
.
Amory
had
stayed
over
a
day
to
see
her
,
and
his
train
*NL*
left
at
twelve-eighteen
that
night
.
His
trunk
and
suitcase
awaited
him
*NL*
at
the
station
;
his
watch
was
beginning
to
hang
heavy
in
his
pocket
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Isabelle
,
''
he
said
suddenly
,
``
I
want
to
tell
you
something
.
''
They
had
*NL*
been
talking
lightly
about
``
that
funny
look
in
her
eyes
,
''
and
Isabelle
*NL*
knew
from
the
change
in
his
manner
what
was
coming
--
indeed
,
she
had
been
*NL*
wondering
how
soon
it
would
come
.
Amory
reached
above
their
heads
and
*NL*
turned
out
the
electric
light
,
so
that
they
were
in
the
dark
,
except
*NL*
for
the
red
glow
that
fell
through
the
door
from
the
reading-room
lamps
.
*NL*
Then
he
began
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
whether
or
not
you
know
what
you
--
what
I
'm
going
to
say
.
*NL*
Lordy
,
Isabelle
--
this
_
sounds
_
like
a
line
,
but
it
is
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
,
''
said
Isabelle
softly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Maybe
we
'll
never
meet
again
like
this
--
I
have
darned
hard
luck
*NL*
sometimes
.
''
He
was
leaning
away
from
her
on
the
other
arm
of
the
lounge
,
*NL*
but
she
could
see
his
eyes
plainly
in
the
dark
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
meet
me
again
--
silly
.
''
There
was
just
the
slightest
emphasis
*NL*
on
the
last
word
--
so
that
it
became
almost
a
term
of
endearment
.
He
*NL*
continued
a
bit
huskily
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
fallen
for
a
lot
of
people
--
girls
--
and
I
guess
you
have
,
*NL*
too
--
boys
,
I
mean
,
but
,
honestly
,
you
--
''
he
broke
off
suddenly
and
*NL*
leaned
forward
,
chin
on
his
hands
:
``
Oh
,
what
's
the
use
--
you
'll
go
your
*NL*
way
and
I
suppose
I
'll
go
mine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Silence
for
a
moment
.
Isabelle
was
quite
stirred
;
she
wound
her
*NL*
handkerchief
into
a
tight
ball
,
and
by
the
faint
light
that
streamed
*NL*
over
her
,
dropped
it
deliberately
on
the
floor
.
Their
hands
touched
for
*NL*
an
instant
,
but
neither
spoke
.
Silences
were
becoming
more
frequent
*NL*
and
more
delicious
.
Outside
another
stray
couple
had
come
up
and
were
*NL*
experimenting
on
the
piano
in
the
next
room
.
After
the
usual
preliminary
*NL*
of
``
chopsticks
,
''
one
of
them
started
``
Babes
in
the
Woods
''
and
a
light
*NL*
tenor
carried
the
words
into
the
den
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
me
your
hand
*NL*
I
'll
understand
*NL*
We
're
off
to
slumberland
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Isabelle
hummed
it
softly
and
trembled
as
she
felt
Amory
's
hand
close
*NL*
over
hers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Isabelle
,
''
he
whispered
.
``
You
know
I
'm
mad
about
you
.
You
_
do
_
give
a
*NL*
darn
about
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
much
do
you
care
--
do
you
like
any
one
better
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
He
could
scarcely
hear
her
,
although
he
bent
so
near
that
he
felt
*NL*
her
breath
against
his
cheek
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Isabelle
,
I
'm
going
back
to
college
for
six
long
months
,
and
why
*NL*
should
n't
we
--
if
I
could
only
just
have
one
thing
to
remember
you
by
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Close
the
door
...
''
Her
voice
had
just
stirred
so
that
he
half
wondered
*NL*
whether
she
had
spoken
at
all
.
As
he
swung
the
door
softly
shut
,
the
*NL*
music
seemed
quivering
just
outside
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Moonlight
is
bright
,
*NL*
Kiss
me
good
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
What
a
wonderful
song
,
she
thought
--
everything
was
wonderful
to-night
,
*NL*
most
of
all
this
romantic
scene
in
the
den
,
with
their
hands
clinging
*NL*
and
the
inevitable
looming
charmingly
close
.
The
future
vista
of
her
*NL*
life
seemed
an
unending
succession
of
scenes
like
this
:
under
moonlight
*NL*
and
pale
starlight
,
and
in
the
backs
of
warm
limousines
and
in
low
,
cosy
*NL*
roadsters
stopped
under
sheltering
trees
--
only
the
boy
might
change
,
and
*NL*
this
one
was
so
nice
.
He
took
her
hand
softly
.
With
a
sudden
movement
he
*NL*
turned
it
and
,
holding
it
to
his
lips
,
kissed
the
palm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Isabelle
!
''
His
whisper
blended
in
the
music
,
and
they
seemed
to
*NL*
float
nearer
together
.
Her
breath
came
faster
.
``
Ca
n't
I
kiss
you
,
*NL*
Isabelle
--
Isabelle
?
''
Lips
half
parted
,
she
turned
her
head
to
him
in
the
*NL*
dark
.
Suddenly
the
ring
of
voices
,
the
sound
of
running
footsteps
surged
*NL*
toward
them
.
Quick
as
a
flash
Amory
reached
up
and
turned
on
the
light
,
*NL*
and
when
the
door
opened
and
three
boys
,
the
wrathy
and
dance-craving
*NL*
Froggy
among
them
,
rushed
in
,
he
was
turning
over
the
magazines
on
the
*NL*
table
,
while
she
sat
without
moving
,
serene
and
unembarrassed
,
and
even
*NL*
greeted
them
with
a
welcoming
smile
.
But
her
heart
was
beating
wildly
,
*NL*
and
she
felt
somehow
as
if
she
had
been
deprived
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
evidently
over
.
There
was
a
clamor
for
a
dance
,
there
was
a
*NL*
glance
that
passed
between
them
--
on
his
side
despair
,
on
hers
regret
,
*NL*
and
then
the
evening
went
on
,
with
the
reassured
beaux
and
the
eternal
*NL*
cutting
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
quarter
to
twelve
Amory
shook
hands
with
her
gravely
,
in
the
midst
of
*NL*
a
small
crowd
assembled
to
wish
him
good-speed
.
For
an
instant
he
lost
*NL*
his
poise
,
and
she
felt
a
bit
rattled
when
a
satirical
voice
from
a
*NL*
concealed
wit
cried
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
her
outside
,
Amory
!
''
As
he
took
her
hand
he
pressed
it
a
little
,
*NL*
and
she
returned
the
pressure
as
she
had
done
to
twenty
hands
that
*NL*
evening
--
that
was
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
two
o'clock
back
at
the
Weatherbys
'
Sally
asked
her
if
she
and
Amory
*NL*
had
had
a
``
time
''
in
the
den
.
Isabelle
turned
to
her
quietly
.
In
her
*NL*
eyes
was
the
light
of
the
idealist
,
the
inviolate
dreamer
of
Joan-like
*NL*
dreams
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
she
answered
.
``
I
do
n't
do
that
sort
of
thing
any
more
;
he
asked
me
*NL*
to
,
but
I
said
no
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
crept
in
bed
she
wondered
what
he
'd
say
in
his
special
delivery
*NL*
to-morrow
.
He
had
such
a
good-looking
mouth
--
would
she
ever
--
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fourteen
angels
were
watching
o'er
them
,
''
sang
Sally
sleepily
from
the
*NL*
next
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Damn
!
''
muttered
Isabelle
,
punching
the
pillow
into
a
luxurious
lump
and
*NL*
exploring
the
cold
sheets
cautiously
.
``
Damn
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
*****
*NL*
*NL*
CARNIVAL
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
,
by
way
of
the
Princetonian
,
had
arrived
.
The
minor
snobs
,
finely
*NL*
balanced
thermometers
of
success
,
warmed
to
him
as
the
club
elections
*NL*
grew
nigh
,
and
he
and
Tom
were
visited
by
groups
of
upper
classmen
who
*NL*
arrived
awkwardly
,
balanced
on
the
edge
of
the
furniture
and
talked
of
*NL*
all
subjects
except
the
one
of
absorbing
interest
.
Amory
was
amused
at
*NL*
the
intent
eyes
upon
him
,
and
,
in
case
the
visitors
represented
some
*NL*
club
in
which
he
was
not
interested
,
took
great
pleasure
in
shocking
*NL*
them
with
unorthodox
remarks
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
let
me
see
--
''
he
said
one
night
to
a
flabbergasted
delegation
,
*NL*
``
what
club
do
you
represent
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
visitors
from
Ivy
and
Cottage
and
Tiger
Inn
he
played
the
``
nice
,
*NL*
unspoilt
,
ingenuous
boy
''
very
much
at
ease
and
quite
unaware
of
the
*NL*
object
of
the
call
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
fatal
morning
arrived
,
early
in
March
,
and
the
campus
became
*NL*
a
document
in
hysteria
,
he
slid
smoothly
into
Cottage
with
Alec
Connage
*NL*
and
watched
his
suddenly
neurotic
class
with
much
wonder
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
fickle
groups
that
jumped
from
club
to
club
;
there
were
*NL*
friends
of
two
or
three
days
who
announced
tearfully
and
wildly
that
*NL*
they
must
join
the
same
club
,
nothing
should
separate
them
;
there
were
*NL*
snarling
disclosures
of
long-hidden
grudges
as
the
Suddenly
Prominent
*NL*
remembered
snubs
of
freshman
year
.
Unknown
men
were
elevated
into
*NL*
importance
when
they
received
certain
coveted
bids
;
others
who
were
*NL*
considered
``
all
set
''
found
that
they
had
made
unexpected
enemies
,
felt
*NL*
themselves
stranded
and
deserted
,
talked
wildly
of
leaving
college
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
his
own
crowd
Amory
saw
men
kept
out
for
wearing
green
hats
,
for
*NL*
being
``
a
damn
tailor
's
dummy
,
''
for
having
``
too
much
pull
in
heaven
,
''
*NL*
for
getting
drunk
one
night
``
not
like
a
gentleman
,
by
God
,
''
or
for
*NL*
unfathomable
secret
reasons
known
to
no
one
but
the
wielders
of
the
*NL*
black
balls
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
orgy
of
sociability
culminated
in
a
gigantic
party
at
the
Nassau
*NL*
Inn
,
where
punch
was
dispensed
from
immense
bowls
,
and
the
whole
*NL*
down-stairs
became
a
delirious
,
circulating
,
shouting
pattern
of
faces
*NL*
and
voices
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hi
,
Dibby
--
`
gratulations
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Goo
'
boy
,
Tom
,
you
got
a
good
bunch
in
Cap
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
,
Kerry
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Kerry
--
I
hear
you
went
Tiger
with
all
the
weight-lifters
!
''
``
Well
,
I
*NL*
did
n't
go
Cottage
--
the
parlor-snakes
'
delight
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
say
Overton
fainted
when
he
got
his
Ivy
bid
--
Did
he
sign
up
the
*NL*
first
day
?
--
oh
,
_
no
_
.
Tore
over
to
Murray-Dodge
on
a
bicycle
--
afraid
it
*NL*
was
a
mistake
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
'd
you
get
into
Cap
--
you
old
roue
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Gratulations

''
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Gratulations
yourself
.
Hear
you
got
a
good
crowd
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
bar
closed
,
the
party
broke
up
into
groups
and
streamed
,
*NL*
singing
,
over
the
snow-clad
campus
,
in
a
weird
delusion
that
*NL*
snobbishness
and
strain
were
over
at
last
,
and
that
they
could
do
what
*NL*
they
pleased
for
the
next
two
years
.
*NL*
*NL*
Long
afterward
Amory
thought
of
sophomore
spring
as
the
happiest
time
of
*NL*
his
life
.
His
ideas
were
in
tune
with
life
as
he
found
it
;
he
wanted
*NL*
no
more
than
to
drift
and
dream
and
enjoy
a
dozen
new-found
friendships
*NL*
through
the
April
afternoons
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alec
Connage
came
into
his
room
one
morning
and
woke
him
up
into
the
*NL*
sunshine
and
peculiar
glory
of
Campbell
Hall
shining
in
the
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wake
up
,
Original
Sin
,
and
scrape
yourself
together
.
Be
in
front
of
*NL*
Renwick
's
in
half
an
hour
.
Somebody
's
got
a
car
.
''
He
took
the
bureau
*NL*
cover
and
carefully
deposited
it
,
with
its
load
of
small
articles
,
upon
*NL*
the
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
'd
you
get
the
car
?
''
demanded
Amory
cynically
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sacred
trust
,
but
do
n't
be
a
critical
goopher
or
you
ca
n't
go
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
'll
sleep
,
''
Amory
said
calmly
,
resettling
himself
and
reaching
*NL*
beside
the
bed
for
a
cigarette
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sleep
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
not

I
've

*NL*
*NL*
``

Of

you
do

coast

''
*NL*
*NL*
With
a
bound
Amory
was
out
of
bed
,
scattering
the
bureau
cover
's
burden
*NL*
on
the
floor
.
The
coast
...
he
had
n't
seen
it
for
years
,
since
he
and
his
*NL*
mother
were
on
their
pilgrimage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
's
going

''
he
demanded
as
he
wriggled
into
his
B.
V.
D.

.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

Dick
Humbird

up

*NL*
*NL*
In
ten
minutes
Amory
was
devouring
cornflakes
in
Renwick
's
,
and
at
*NL*
nine-thirty
they
bowled
happily
out
of
town
,
headed
for
the
sands
of
*NL*
Deal
Beach
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You

said
Kerry
,
``

In

suggested
Ferrenby

turning
around
from

There

an

Amory

''
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
subsided
resignedly
and
drooped
into
a
contemplation
of
the
*NL*
scenery
.
Swinburne
seemed
to
fit
in
somehow
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
winter
's
rains
and
ruins
are
over
,
*NL*
And
all
the
seasons
of
snows
and
sins
;
*NL*
The
days
dividing
lover
and
lover
,
*NL*
The
light
that
loses
,
the
night
that
wins
;
*NL*
And
time
remembered
is
grief
forgotten
,
*NL*
And
frosts
are
slain
and
flowers
begotten
,
*NL*
And
in
green
underwood
and
cover
,
*NL*
Blossom
by
blossom
the
spring
begins
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
full
streams
feed
on
flower

''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
matter
,
Amory
?
Amory
's
thinking
about
poetry
,
about
the
*NL*
pretty
birds
and
flowers
.
I
can
see
it
in
his
eye
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
'm
not
,
''
he
lied
.
``
I
'm
thinking
about
the
Princetonian
.
I
ought
to
*NL*
make
up
to-night
;
but
I
can
telephone
back
,
I
suppose
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
said
Kerry
respectfully
,
``
these
important
men
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
flushed
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
Ferrenby
,
a
defeated
competitor
,
*NL*
winced
a
little
.
Of
course
,
Kerry
was
only
kidding
,
but
he
really
*NL*
must
n't
mention
the
Princetonian
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
halcyon
day
,
and
as
they
neared
the
shore
and
the
salt
breezes
*NL*
scurried
by
,
he
began
to
picture
the
ocean
and
long
,
level
stretches
of
*NL*
sand
and
red
roofs
over
blue
sea
.
Then
they
hurried
through
the
little
*NL*
town
and
it
all
flashed
upon
his
consciousness
to
a
mighty
paean
of
*NL*
emotion
...
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
good
Lord
!
_
Look
_
at
it
!
''
he
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
out
,
quick
--
I
have
n't
seen
it
for
eight
years
!
Oh
,
gentlefolk
,
*NL*
stop
the
car
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
an
odd
child
!
''
remarked
Alec
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
believe
he
's
a
bit
eccentric
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
car
was
obligingly
drawn
up
at
a
curb
,
and
Amory
ran
for
the
*NL*
boardwalk
.
First
,
he
realized
that
the
sea
was
blue
and
that
there
was
*NL*
an
enormous
quantity
of
it
,
and
that
it
roared
and
roared
--
really
all
*NL*
the
banalities
about
the
ocean
that
one
could
realize
,
but
if
any
one
*NL*
had
told
him
then
that
these
things
were
banalities
,
he
would
have
gaped
*NL*
in
wonder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
we
'll
get
lunch
,
''
ordered
Kerry
,
wandering
up
with
the
crowd
.
``
Come
*NL*
on
,
Amory
,
tear
yourself
away
and
get
practical
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
'll
try
the
best
hotel
first
,
''
he
went
on
,
``
and
thence
and
so
forth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
strolled
along
the
boardwalk
to
the
most
imposing
hostelry
in
*NL*
sight
,
and
,
entering
the
dining-room
,
scattered
about
a
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eight
Bronxes
,
''
commanded
Alec
,
``
and
a
club
sandwich
and
Juliennes
.
The
*NL*
food
for
one
.
Hand
the
rest
around
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
ate
little
,
having
seized
a
chair
where
he
could
watch
the
sea
and
*NL*
feel
the
rock
of
it
.
When
luncheon
was
over
they
sat
and
smoked
quietly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
bill
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Some
one
scanned
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eight
twenty-five
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rotten
overcharge
.
We
'll
give
them
two
dollars
and
one
for
the
waiter

*NL*
Kerry
,
collect
the
small
change
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
waiter
approached
,
and
Kerry
gravely
handed
him
a
dollar
,
tossed
two
*NL*
dollars
on
the
check
,
and
turned
away
.
They
sauntered
leisurely
toward
*NL*
the
door
,
pursued
in
a
moment
by
the
suspicious
Ganymede
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Some
mistake
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Kerry
took
the
bill
and
examined
it
critically
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
mistake
!
''
he
said
,
shaking
his
head
gravely
,
and
,
tearing
it
into
*NL*
four
pieces
,
he
handed
the
scraps
to
the
waiter
,
who
was
so
dumfounded
*NL*
that
he
stood
motionless
and
expressionless
while
they
walked
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wo
n't
he
send
after
us
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Kerry
;
``
for
a
minute
he
'll
think
we
're
the
proprietor
's
sons
*NL*
or
something
;
then
he
'll
look
at
the
check
again
and
call
the
manager
,
*NL*
and
in
the
meantime
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
left
the
car
at
Asbury
and
street-car
'd
to
Allenhurst
,
where
*NL*
they
investigated
the
crowded
pavilions
for
beauty
.
At
four
there
were
*NL*
refreshments
in
a
lunch-room
,
and
this
time
they
paid
an
even
smaller
*NL*
per
cent
on
the
total
cost
;
something
about
the
appearance
and
*NL*
savoir-faire
of
the
crowd
made
the
thing
go
,
and
they
were
not
pursued
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
Amory
,
we
're
Marxian
Socialists
,
''
explained
Kerry
.
``
We
do
n't
*NL*
believe
in
property
and
we
're
putting
it
to
the
great
test
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Night
will
descend
,
''
Amory
suggested
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Watch
,
and
put
your
trust
in
Holiday
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
became
jovial
about
five-thirty
and
,
linking
arms
,
strolled
up
and
*NL*
down
the
boardwalk
in
a
row
,
chanting
a
monotonous
ditty
about
the
sad
*NL*
sea
waves
.
Then
Kerry
saw
a
face
in
the
crowd
that
attracted
him
and
,
*NL*
rushing
off
,
reappeared
in
a
moment
with
one
of
the
homeliest
girls
*NL*
Amory
had
ever
set
eyes
on
.
Her
pale
mouth
extended
from
ear
to
ear
,
her
*NL*
teeth
projected
in
a
solid
wedge
,
and
she
had
little
,
squinty
eyes
that
*NL*
peeped
ingratiatingly
over
the
side
sweep
of
her
nose
.
Kerry
presented
*NL*
them
formally
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Name
of
Kaluka
,
Hawaiian
queen
!
Let
me
present
Messrs.
Connage
,
Sloane
,
*NL*
Humbird
,
Ferrenby
,
and
Blaine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
girl
bobbed
courtesies
all
around
.
Poor
creature
;
Amory
supposed
she
*NL*
had
never
before
been
noticed
in
her
life
--
possibly
she
was
half-witted
.
*NL*
While
she
accompanied
them
-LRB-
Kerry
had
invited
her
to
supper
-RRB-
she
said
*NL*
nothing
which
could
discountenance
such
a
belief
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
prefers
her
native
dishes
,
''
said
Alec
gravely
to
the
waiter
,
``
but
*NL*
any
coarse
food
will
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
through
supper
he
addressed
her
in
the
most
respectful
language
,
*NL*
while
Kerry
made
idiotic
love
to
her
on
the
other
side
,
and
she
giggled
*NL*
and
grinned
.
Amory
was
content
to
sit
and
watch
the
by-play
,
thinking
*NL*
what
a
light
touch
Kerry
had
,
and
how
he
could
transform
the
barest
*NL*
incident
into
a
thing
of
curve
and
contour
.
They
all
seemed
to
have
*NL*
the
spirit
of
it
more
or
less
,
and
it
was
a
relaxation
to
be
with
them
.
*NL*
Amory
usually
liked
men
individually
,
yet
feared
them
in
crowds
unless
*NL*
the
crowd
was
around
him
.
He
wondered
how
much
each
one
contributed
to
*NL*
the
party
,
for
there
was
somewhat
of
a
spiritual
tax
levied
.
Alec
and
*NL*
Kerry
were
the
life
of
it
,
but
not
quite
the
centre
.
Somehow
the
quiet
*NL*
Humbird
,
and
Sloane
,
with
his
impatient
superciliousness
,
were
the
*NL*
centre
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dick
Humbird
had
,
ever
since
freshman
year
,
seemed
to
Amory
a
perfect
*NL*
type
of
aristocrat
.
He
was
slender
but
well-built
--
black
curly
hair
,
*NL*
straight
features
,
and
rather
a
dark
skin
.
Everything
he
said
sounded
*NL*
intangibly
appropriate
.
He
possessed
infinite
courage
,
an
averagely
good
*NL*
mind
,
and
a
sense
of
honor
with
a
clear
charm
and
_
noblesse
oblige
_
*NL*
that
varied
it
from
righteousness
.
He
could
dissipate
without
going
to
*NL*
pieces
,
and
even
his
most
bohemian
adventures
never
seemed
``
running
it
*NL*
out
.
''
People
dressed
like
him
,
tried
to
talk
as
he
did
...
Amory
decided
*NL*
that
he
probably
held
the
world
back
,
but
he
would
n't
have
changed
him
.
*NL*
...
*NL*
*NL*
He
differed
from
the
healthy
type
that
was
essentially
middle
class
--
he
*NL*
never
seemed
to
perspire
.
Some
people
could
n't
be
familiar
with
a
*NL*
chauffeur
without
having
it
returned
;
Humbird
could
have
lunched
at
*NL*
Sherry
's
with
a
colored
man
,
yet
people
would
have
somehow
known
that
*NL*
it
was
all
right
.
He
was
not
a
snob
,
though
he
knew
only
half
his
class
.
*NL*
His
friends
ranged
from
the
highest
to
the
lowest
,
but
it
was
impossible
*NL*
to
``
cultivate
''
him
.
Servants
worshipped
him
,
and
treated
him
like
a
god
.
*NL*
He
seemed
the
eternal
example
of
what
the
upper
class
tries
to
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
like
those
pictures
in
the
Illustrated
London
News
of
the
English
*NL*
officers
who
have
been
killed
,
''
Amory
had
said
to
Alec
.
``
Well
,
''
Alec
*NL*
had
answered
,
``
if
you
want
to
know
the
shocking
truth
,
his
father
was
a
*NL*
grocery
clerk
who
made
a
fortune
in
Tacoma
real
estate
and
came
to
New
*NL*
York
ten
years
ago
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
had
felt
a
curious
sinking
sensation
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
present
type
of
party
was
made
possible
by
the
surging
together
of
*NL*
the
class
after
club
elections
--
as
if
to
make
a
last
desperate
attempt
*NL*
to
know
itself
,
to
keep
together
,
to
fight
off
the
tightening
spirit
of
*NL*
the
clubs
.
It
was
a
let-down
from
the
conventional
heights
they
had
all
*NL*
walked
so
rigidly
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
supper
they
saw
Kaluka
to
the
boardwalk
,
and
then
strolled
back
*NL*
along
the
beach
to
Asbury
.
The
evening
sea
was
a
new
sensation
,
for
all
*NL*
its
color
and
mellow
age
was
gone
,
and
it
seemed
the
bleak
waste
that
*NL*
made
the
Norse
sagas
sad
;
Amory
thought
of
Kipling
's
*NL*
*NL*
``
Beaches
of
Lukanon
before
the
sealers
came
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
still
a
music
,
though
,
infinitely
sorrowful
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ten
o'clock
found
them
penniless
.
They
had
suppered
greatly
on
their
*NL*
last
eleven
cents
and
,
singing
,
strolled
up
through
the
casinos
and
*NL*
lighted
arches
on
the
boardwalk
,
stopping
to
listen
approvingly
to
all
*NL*
band
concerts
.
In
one
place
Kerry
took
up
a
collection
for
the
French
*NL*
War
Orphans
which
netted
a
dollar
and
twenty
cents
,
and
with
this
they
*NL*
bought
some
brandy
in
case
they
caught
cold
in
the
night
.
They
finished
*NL*
the
day
in
a
moving-picture
show
and
went
into
solemn
systematic
roars
*NL*
of
laughter
at
an
ancient
comedy
,
to
the
startled
annoyance
of
the
rest
*NL*
of
the
audience
.
Their
entrance
was
distinctly
strategic
,
for
each
man
*NL*
as
he
entered
pointed
reproachfully
at
the
one
just
behind
him
.
Sloane
,
*NL*
bringing
up
the
rear
,
disclaimed
all
knowledge
and
responsibility
as
*NL*
soon
as
the
others
were
scattered
inside
;
then
as
the
irate
ticket-taker
*NL*
rushed
in
he
followed
nonchalantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
reassembled
later
by
the
Casino
and
made
arrangements
for
the
*NL*
night
.
Kerry
wormed
permission
from
the
watchman
to
sleep
on
the
*NL*
platform
and
,
having
collected
a
huge
pile
of
rugs
from
the
booths
to
*NL*
serve
as
mattresses
and
blankets
,
they
talked
until
midnight
,
and
then
*NL*
fell
into
a
dreamless
sleep
,
though
Amory
tried
hard
to
stay
awake
and
*NL*
watch
that
marvellous
moon
settle
on
the
sea
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
they
progressed
for
two
happy
days
,
up
and
down
the
shore
by
*NL*
street-car
or
machine
,
or
by
shoe-leather
on
the
crowded
boardwalk
;
*NL*
sometimes
eating
with
the
wealthy
,
more
frequently
dining
frugally
*NL*
at
the
expense
of
an
unsuspecting
restaurateur
.
They
had
their
photos
*NL*
taken
,
eight
poses
,
in
a
quick-development
store
.
Kerry
insisted
on
*NL*
grouping
them
as
a
``
varsity
''
football
team
,
and
then
as
a
tough
gang
*NL*
from
the
East
Side
,
with
their
coats
inside
out
,
and
himself
sitting
*NL*
in
the
middle
on
a
cardboard
moon
.
The
photographer
probably
has
them
*NL*
yet
--
at
least
,
they
never
called
for
them
.
The
weather
was
perfect
,
and
*NL*
again
they
slept
outside
,
and
again
Amory
fell
unwillingly
asleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sunday
broke
stolid
and
respectable
,
and
even
the
sea
seemed
to
mumble
*NL*
and
complain
,
so
they
returned
to
Princeton
via
the
Fords
of
transient
*NL*
farmers
,
and
broke
up
with
colds
in
their
heads
,
but
otherwise
none
the
*NL*
worse
for
wandering
.
*NL*
*NL*
Even
more
than
in
the
year
before
,
Amory
neglected
his
work
,
not
*NL*
deliberately
but
lazily
and
through
a
multitude
of
other
interests
.
*NL*
Co-ordinate
geometry
and
the
melancholy
hexameters
of
Corneille
and
*NL*
Racine
held
forth
small
allurements
,
and
even
psychology
,
which
he
had
*NL*
eagerly
awaited
,
proved
to
be
a
dull
subject
full
of
muscular
reactions
*NL*
and
biological
phrases
rather
than
the
study
of
personality
and
*NL*
influence
.
That
was
a
noon
class
,
and
it
always
sent
him
dozing
.
*NL*
Having
found
that
``
subjective
and
objective
,
sir
,
''
answered
most
of
the
*NL*
questions
,
he
used
the
phrase
on
all
occasions
,
and
it
became
the
class
*NL*
joke
when
,
on
a
query
being
levelled
at
him
,
he
was
nudged
awake
by
*NL*
Ferrenby
or
Sloane
to
gasp
it
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mostly
there
were
parties
--
to
Orange
or
the
Shore
,
more
rarely
to
*NL*
New
York
and
Philadelphia
,
though
one
night
they
marshalled
fourteen
*NL*
waitresses
out
of
Childs
'
and
took
them
to
ride
down
Fifth
Avenue
on
top
*NL*
of
an
auto
bus
.
They
all
cut
more
classes
than
were
allowed
,
which
meant
*NL*
an
additional
course
the
following
year
,
but
spring
was
too
rare
to
*NL*
let
anything
interfere
with
their
colorful
ramblings
.
In
May
Amory
was
*NL*
elected
to
the
Sophomore
Prom
Committee
,
and
when
after
a
long
*NL*
evening
's
discussion
with
Alec
they
made
out
a
tentative
list
of
class
*NL*
probabilities
for
the
senior
council
,
they
placed
themselves
among
the
*NL*
surest
.
The
senior
council
was
composed
presumably
of
the
eighteen
most
*NL*
representative
seniors
,
and
in
view
of
Alec
's
football
managership
and
*NL*
Amory
's
chance
of
nosing
out
Burne
Holiday
as
Princetonian
chairman
,
*NL*
they
seemed
fairly
justified
in
this
presumption
.
Oddly
enough
,
they
*NL*
both
placed
D'Invilliers
as
among
the
possibilities
,
a
guess
that
a
year
*NL*
before
the
class
would
have
gaped
at
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
through
the
spring
Amory
had
kept
up
an
intermittent
correspondence
*NL*
with
Isabelle
Borge
,
punctuated
by
violent
squabbles
and
chiefly
*NL*
enlivened
by
his
attempts
to
find
new
words
for
love
.
He
discovered
*NL*
Isabelle
to
be
discreetly
and
aggravatingly
unsentimental
in
letters
,
*NL*
but
he
hoped
against
hope
that
she
would
prove
not
too
exotic
a
bloom
*NL*
to
fit
the
large
spaces
of
spring
as
she
had
fitted
the
den
in
the
*NL*
Minnehaha
Club
.
During
May
he
wrote
thirty-page
documents
almost
*NL*
nightly
,
and
sent
them
to
her
in
bulky
envelopes
exteriorly
labelled
*NL*
``
Part
I
''
and
``
Part
II
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Alec
,
I
believe
I
'm
tired
of
college
,
''
he
said
sadly
,
as
they
*NL*
walked
the
dusk
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
am
,
too
,
in
a
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
I
'd
like
would
be
a
little
home
in
the
country
,
some
warm
country
,
*NL*
and
a
wife
,
and
just
enough
to
do
to
keep
from
rotting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Me
,
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'd
like
to
quit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
does
your
girl
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
Amory
gasped
in
horror
.
``
She
would
n't
_
think
_
of
marrying
...
that
*NL*
is
,
not
now
.
I
mean
the
future
,
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
girl
would
.
I
'm
engaged
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
really
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
Do
n't
say
a
word
to
anybody
,
please
,
but
I
am
.
I
may
not
come
back
*NL*
next
year
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
're
only
twenty
!
Give
up
college
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
Amory
,
you
were
saying
a
minute
ago
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
Amory
interrupted
,
``
but
I
was
just
wishing
.
I
would
n't
think
of
*NL*
leaving
college
.
It
's
just
that
I
feel
so
sad
these
wonderful
nights
.
I
*NL*
sort
of
feel
they
're
never
coming
again
,
and
I
'm
not
really
getting
all
*NL*
I
could
out
of
them
.
I
wish
my
girl
lived
here
.
But
marry
--
not
a
chance
.
*NL*
Especially
as
father
says
the
money
is
n't
forthcoming
as
it
used
to
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
waste
these
nights
are
!
''
agreed
Alec
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Amory
sighed
and
made
use
of
the
nights
.
He
had
a
snap-shot
of
*NL*
Isabelle
,
enshrined
in
an
old
watch
,
and
at
eight
almost
every
night
he
*NL*
would
turn
off
all
the
lights
except
the
desk
lamp
and
,
sitting
by
the
*NL*
open
windows
with
the
picture
before
him
,
write
her
rapturous
letters
.
*NL*
*NL*
...
Oh
it
's
so
hard
to
write
you
what
I
really
_
feel
_
when
I
*NL*
think
about
you
so
much
;
you
've
gotten
to
mean
to
me
a
_
dream
_
that
*NL*
I
ca
n't
put
on
paper
any
more
.
Your
last
letter
came
and
it
was
*NL*
wonderful
!
I
read
it
over
about
six
times
,
especially
the
last
*NL*
part
,
but
I
do
wish
,
sometimes
,
you
'd
be
more
_
frank
_
and
tell
me
*NL*
what
you
really
do
think
of
me
,
yet
your
last
letter
was
too
good
*NL*
to
be
true
,
and
I
can
hardly
wait
until
June
!
Be
sure
and
be
able
*NL*
to
come
to
the
prom
.
It
'll
be
fine
,
I
think
,
and
I
want
to
bring
*NL*
_
you
_
just
at
the
end
of
a
wonderful
year
.
I
often
think
over
what
*NL*
you
said
on
that
night
and
wonder
how
much
you
meant
.
If
it
were
*NL*
anyone
but
you
--
but
you
see
I
_
thought
_
you
were
fickle
the
first
*NL*
time
I
saw
you
and
you
are
so
popular
and
everthing
that
I
ca
n't
*NL*
imagine
you
really
liking
me
_
best
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oh
,
Isabelle
,
dear
--
it
's
a
wonderful
night
.
Somebody
is
playing
*NL*
``
Love
Moon
''
on
a
mandolin
far
across
the
campus
,
and
the
music
*NL*
seems
to
bring
you
into
the
window
.
Now
he
's
playing
``
Good-by
,
*NL*
Boys
,
I
'm
Through
,
''
and
how
well
it
suits
me
.
For
I
am
through
*NL*
with
everything
.
I
have
decided
never
to
take
a
cocktail
again
,
*NL*
and
I
know
I
'll
never
again
fall
in
love
--
I
could
n't
--
you
've
been
*NL*
too
much
a
part
of
my
days
and
nights
to
ever
let
me
think
of
*NL*
another
girl
.
I
meet
them
all
the
time
and
they
do
n't
interest
me
.
*NL*
I
'm
not
pretending
to
be
blase
,
because
it
's
not
that
.
It
's
just
*NL*
that
I
'm
in
love
.
Oh
,
_
dearest
_
Isabelle
-LRB-
somehow
I
ca
n't
call
you
*NL*
just
Isabelle
,
and
I
'm
afraid
I
'll
come
out
with
the
``
dearest
''
*NL*
before
your
family
this
June
-RRB-
,
you
've
got
to
come
to
the
prom
,
*NL*
and
then
I
'll
come
up
to
your
house
for
a
day
and
everything
'll
be
*NL*
perfect
...
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
on
in
an
eternal
monotone
that
seemed
to
both
of
them
infinitely
*NL*
charming
,
infinitely
new
.
*NL*
*NL*
*****
*NL*
*NL*
June
came
and
the
days
grew
so
hot
and
lazy
that
they
could
not
worry
*NL*
even
about
exams
,
but
spent
dreamy
evenings
on
the
court
of
Cottage
,
*NL*
talking
of
long
subjects
until
the
sweep
of
country
toward
Stony
Brook
*NL*
became
a
blue
haze
and
the
lilacs
were
white
around
tennis-courts
,
and
*NL*
words
gave
way
to
silent
cigarettes
...
Then
down
deserted
Prospect
and
*NL*
along
McCosh
with
song
everywhere
around
them
,
up
to
the
hot
joviality
*NL*
of
Nassau
Street
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
D'Invilliers
and
Amory
walked
late
in
those
days
.
A
gambling
fever
*NL*
swept
through
the
sophomore
class
and
they
bent
over
the
bones
till
*NL*
three
o'clock
many
a
sultry
night
.
After
one
session
they
came
out
of
*NL*
Sloane
's
room
to
find
the
dew
fallen
and
the
stars
old
in
the
sky
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
's
borrow
bicycles
and
take
a
ride
,
''
Amory
suggested
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
.
I
'm
not
a
bit
tired
and
this
is
almost
the
last
night
of
the
*NL*
year
,
really
,
because
the
prom
stuff
starts
Monday
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
found
two
unlocked
bicycles
in
Holder
Court
and
rode
out
about
*NL*
half-past
three
along
the
Lawrenceville
Road
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
going
to
do
this
summer
,
Amory
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
ask
me
--
same
old
things
,
I
suppose
.
A
month
or
two
in
Lake
*NL*
Geneva
--
I
'm
counting
on
you
to
be
there
in
July
,
you
know
--
then
there
'll
*NL*
be
Minneapolis
,
and
that
means
hundreds
of
summer
hops
,
parlor-snaking
,
*NL*
getting
bored
--
But
oh
,
Tom
,
''
he
added
suddenly
,
``
has
n't
this
year
been
*NL*
slick
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
declared
Tom
emphatically
,
a
new
Tom
,
clothed
by
Brooks
,
shod
*NL*
by
Franks
,
``
I
've
won
this
game
,
but
I
feel
as
if
I
never
want
to
play
*NL*
another
.
You
're
all
right
--
you
're
a
rubber
ball
,
and
somehow
it
suits
*NL*
you
,
but
I
'm
sick
of
adapting
myself
to
the
local
snobbishness
of
this
*NL*
corner
of
the
world
.
I
want
to
go
where
people
are
n't
barred
because
of
*NL*
the
color
of
their
neckties
and
the
roll
of
their
coats
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ca
n't
,
Tom
,
''
argued
Amory
,
as
they
rolled
along
through
the
*NL*
scattering
night
;
``
wherever
you
go
now
you
'll
always
unconsciously
apply
*NL*
these
standards
of
`
having
it
'
or
`
lacking
it
.
'
For
better
or
worse
*NL*
we
've
stamped
you
;
you
're
a
Princeton
type
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
''
complained
Tom
,
his
cracked
voice
rising
plaintively
,
``
why
*NL*
do
I
have
to
come
back
at
all
?
I
've
learned
all
that
Princeton
has
to
*NL*
offer
.
Two
years
more
of
mere
pedantry
and
lying
around
a
club
are
n't
*NL*
going
to
help
.
They
're
just
going
to
disorganize
me
,
conventionalize
me
*NL*
completely
.
Even
now
I
'm
so
spineless
that
I
wonder
how
I
get
away
with
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
but
you
're
missing
the
real
point
,
Tom
,
''
Amory
interrupted
.
``
You
've
*NL*
just
had
your
eyes
opened
to
the
snobbishness
of
the
world
in
a
rather
*NL*
abrupt
manner
.
Princeton
invariably
gives
the
thoughtful
man
a
social
*NL*
sense
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
consider
you
taught
me
that
,
do
n't
you
?
''
he
asked
quizzically
,
*NL*
eying
Amory
in
the
half
dark
.
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
laughed
quietly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
n't
I
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sometimes
,
''
he
said
slowly
,
``
I
think
you
're
my
bad
angel
.
I
might
have
*NL*
been
a
pretty
fair
poet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
on
,
that
's
rather
hard
.
You
chose
to
come
to
an
Eastern
college
.
*NL*
Either
your
eyes
were
opened
to
the
mean
scrambling
quality
of
people
,
*NL*
or
you
'd
have
gone
through
blind
,
and
you
'd
hate
to
have
done
that
--
been
*NL*
like
Marty
Kaye
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
he
agreed
,
``
you
're
right
.
I
would
n't
have
liked
it
.
Still
,
it
's
*NL*
hard
to
be
made
a
cynic
at
twenty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
born
one
,
''
Amory
murmured
.
``
I
'm
a
cynical
idealist
.
''
He
paused
*NL*
and
wondered
if
that
meant
anything
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
reached
the
sleeping
school
of
Lawrenceville
,
and
turned
to
ride
*NL*
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
good
,
this
ride
,
is
n't
it
?
''
Tom
said
presently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
it
's
a
good
finish
,
it
's
knock-out
;
everything
's
good
to-night
.
*NL*
Oh
,
for
a
hot
,
languorous
summer
and
Isabelle
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
and
your
Isabelle
!
I
'll
bet
she
's
a
simple
one
...
let
's
say
*NL*
some
poetry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
Amory
declaimed
``
The
Ode
to
a
Nightingale
''
to
the
bushes
they
passed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
never
be
a
poet
,
''
said
Amory
as
he
finished
.
``
I
'm
not
enough
of
a
*NL*
sensualist
really
;
there
are
only
a
few
obvious
things
that
I
notice
as
*NL*
primarily
beautiful
:
women
,
spring
evenings
,
music
at
night
,
the
sea
;
*NL*
I
do
n't
catch
the
subtle
things
like
`
silver-snarling
trumpets
.
'
I
may
*NL*
turn
out
an
intellectual
,
but
I
'll
never
write
anything
but
mediocre
*NL*
poetry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
rode
into
Princeton
as
the
sun
was
making
colored
maps
of
the
sky
*NL*
behind
the
graduate
school
,
and
hurried
to
the
refreshment
of
a
shower
*NL*
that
would
have
to
serve
in
place
of
sleep
.
By
noon
the
bright-costumed
*NL*
alumni
crowded
the
streets
with
their
bands
and
choruses
,
and
in
the
*NL*
tents
there
was
great
reunion
under
the
orange-and-black
banners
that
*NL*
curled
and
strained
in
the
wind
.
Amory
looked
long
at
one
house
which
*NL*
bore
the
legend
``
Sixty-nine
.
''
There
a
few
gray-haired
men
sat
and
talked
*NL*
quietly
while
the
classes
swept
by
in
panorama
of
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
*****
*NL*
*NL*
UNDER
THE
ARC-LIGHT
*NL*
*NL*
Then
tragedy
's
emerald
eyes
glared
suddenly
at
Amory
over
the
edge
of
*NL*
June
.
On
the
night
after
his
ride
to
Lawrenceville
a
crowd
sallied
to
*NL*
New
York
in
quest
of
adventure
,
and
started
back
to
Princeton
about
*NL*
twelve
o'clock
in
two
machines
.
It
had
been
a
gay
party
and
different
*NL*
stages
of
sobriety
were
represented
.
Amory
was
in
the
car
behind
;
they
*NL*
had
taken
the
wrong
road
and
lost
the
way
,
and
so
were
hurrying
to
catch
*NL*
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
clear
night
and
the
exhilaration
of
the
road
went
to
Amory
's
*NL*
head
.
He
had
the
ghost
of
two
stanzas
of
a
poem
forming
in
his
mind
.
...
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
So
the
gray
car
crept
nightward
in
the
dark
and
there
was
no
life
*NL*
stirred
as
it
went
by
...
As
the
still
ocean
paths
before
the
*NL*
shark
in
starred
and
glittering
waterways
,
beauty-high
,
the
*NL*
moon-swathed
trees
divided
,
pair
on
pair
,
while
flapping
*NL*
nightbirds
cried
across
the
air
...
*NL*
*NL*
A
moment
by
an
inn
of
lamps
and
shades
,
a
yellow
inn
under
a
*NL*
yellow
moon
--
then
silence
,
where
crescendo
laughter
fades
...
the
*NL*
car
swung
out
again
to
the
winds
of
June
,
mellowed
the
shadows
*NL*
where
the
distance
grew
,
then
crushed
the
yellow
shadows
into
*NL*
blue
...
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
They
jolted
to
a
stop
,
and
Amory
peered
up
,
startled
.
A
woman
was
*NL*
standing
beside
the
road
,
talking
to
Alec
at
the
wheel
.
Afterward
*NL*
he
remembered
the
harpy
effect
that
her
old
kimono
gave
her
,
and
the
*NL*
cracked
hollowness
of
her
voice
as
she
spoke
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
Princeton
boys
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
there
's
one
of
you
killed
here
,
and
two
others
about
dead
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
My
God
!
_
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
!
''
She
pointed
and
they
gazed
in
horror
.
Under
the
full
light
of
*NL*
a
roadside
arc-light
lay
a
form
,
face
downward
in
a
widening
circle
of
*NL*
blood
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
sprang
from
the
car
.
Amory
thought
of
the
back
of
that
head
--
that
*NL*
hair
--
that
hair
...
and
then
they
turned
the
form
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
Dick
--
Dick
Humbird
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Christ
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Feel
his
heart
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
the
insistent
voice
of
the
old
crone
in
a
sort
of
croaking
triumph
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
quite
dead
,
all
right
.
The
car
turned
over
.
Two
of
the
men
that
*NL*
were
n't
hurt
just
carried
the
others
in
,
but
this
one
's
no
use
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
rushed
into
the
house
and
the
rest
followed
with
a
limp
mass
that
*NL*
they
laid
on
the
sofa
in
the
shoddy
little
front
parlor
.
Sloane
,
with
*NL*
his
shoulder
punctured
,
was
on
another
lounge
.
He
was
half
delirious
,
*NL*
and
kept
calling
something
about
a
chemistry
lecture
at
8:10
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
what
happened
,
''
said
Ferrenby
in
a
strained
voice
.
``
Dick
*NL*
was
driving
and
he
would
n't
give
up
the
wheel
;
we
told
him
he
'd
been
*NL*
drinking
too
much
--
then
there
was
this
damn
curve
--
oh
,
my
_
God
!
_
...
''
He
*NL*
threw
himself
face
downward
on
the
floor
and
broke
into
dry
sobs
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
doctor
had
arrived
,
and
Amory
went
over
to
the
couch
,
where
some
*NL*
one
handed
him
a
sheet
to
put
over
the
body
.
With
a
sudden
hardness
,
he
*NL*
raised
one
of
the
hands
and
let
it
fall
back
inertly
.
The
brow
was
cold
*NL*
but
the
face
not
expressionless
.
He
looked
at
the
shoe-laces
--
Dick
had
*NL*
tied
them
that
morning
.
_
He
_
had
tied
them
--
and
now
he
was
this
heavy
*NL*
white
mass
.
All
that
remained
of
the
charm
and
personality
of
the
Dick
*NL*
Humbird
he
had
known
--
oh
,
it
was
all
so
horrible
and
unaristocratic
and
*NL*
close
to
the
earth
.
All
tragedy
has
that
strain
of
the
grotesque
*NL*
and
squalid
--
so
useless
,
futile
...
the
way
animals
die
...
Amory
was
*NL*
reminded
of
a
cat
that
had
lain
horribly
mangled
in
some
alley
of
his
*NL*
childhood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Some
one
go
to
Princeton
with
Ferrenby
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
stepped
outside
the
door
and
shivered
slightly
at
the
late
night
*NL*
wind
--
a
wind
that
stirred
a
broken
fender
on
the
mass
of
bent
metal
to
a
*NL*
plaintive
,
tinny
sound
.
*NL*
*NL*
*****
*NL*
*NL*
CRESCENDO
!
*NL*
*NL*
Next
day
,
by
a
merciful
chance
,
passed
in
a
whirl
.
When
Amory
was
by
*NL*
himself
his
thoughts
zigzagged
inevitably
to
the
picture
of
that
red
*NL*
mouth
yawning
incongruously
in
the
white
face
,
but
with
a
determined
*NL*
effort
he
piled
present
excitement
upon
the
memory
of
it
and
shut
it
*NL*
coldly
away
from
his
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
Isabelle
and
her
mother
drove
into
town
at
four
,
and
they
rode
up
*NL*
smiling
Prospect
Avenue
,
through
the
gay
crowd
,
to
have
tea
at
Cottage
.
*NL*
The
clubs
had
their
annual
dinners
that
night
,
so
at
seven
he
loaned
her
*NL*
to
a
freshman
and
arranged
to
meet
her
in
the
gymnasium
at
eleven
,
when
*NL*
the
upper
classmen
were
admitted
to
the
freshman
dance
.
She
was
all
he
*NL*
had
expected
,
and
he
was
happy
and
eager
to
make
that
night
the
centre
*NL*
of
every
dream
.
At
nine
the
upper
classes
stood
in
front
of
the
clubs
*NL*
as
the
freshman
torchlight
parade
rioted
past
,
and
Amory
wondered
if
the
*NL*
dress-suited
groups
against
the
dark
,
stately
backgrounds
and
under
*NL*
the
flare
of
the
torches
made
the
night
as
brilliant
to
the
staring
,
*NL*
cheering
freshmen
as
it
had
been
to
him
the
year
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
was
another
whirl
.
They
lunched
in
a
gay
party
of
six
in
a
*NL*
private
dining-room
at
the
club
,
while
Isabelle
and
Amory
looked
at
each
*NL*
other
tenderly
over
the
fried
chicken
and
knew
that
their
love
was
to
be
*NL*
eternal
.
They
danced
away
the
prom
until
five
,
and
the
stags
cut
in
on
*NL*
Isabelle
with
joyous
abandon
,
which
grew
more
and
more
enthusiastic
as
*NL*
the
hour
grew
late
,
and
their
wines
,
stored
in
overcoat
pockets
in
the
*NL*
coat
room
,
made
old
weariness
wait
until
another
day
.
The
stag
line
is
*NL*
a
most
homogeneous
mass
of
men
.
It
fairly
sways
with
a
single
soul
.
A
*NL*
dark-haired
beauty
dances
by
and
there
is
a
half-gasping
sound
as
the
*NL*
ripple
surges
forward
and
some
one
sleeker
than
the
rest
darts
out
and
*NL*
cuts
in
.
Then
when
the
six-foot
girl
-LRB-
brought
by
Kaye
in
your
class
,
and
*NL*
to
whom
he
has
been
trying
to
introduce
you
all
evening
-RRB-
gallops
by
,
*NL*
the
line
surges
back
and
the
groups
face
about
and
become
intent
on
far
*NL*
corners
of
the
hall
,
for
Kaye
,
anxious
and
perspiring
,
appears
elbowing
*NL*
through
the
crowd
in
search
of
familiar
faces
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
,
old
man
,
I
've
got
an
awfully
nice
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sorry
,
Kaye
,
but
I
'm
set
for
this
one
.
I
've
got
to
cut
in
on
a
fella
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
the
next
one
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
--
ah
--
er
--
I
swear
I
've
got
to
go
cut
in
--
look
me
up
when
she
's
got
*NL*
a
dance
free
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
delighted
Amory
when
Isabelle
suggested
that
they
leave
for
a
while
*NL*
and
drive
around
in
her
car
.
For
a
delicious
hour
that
passed
too
soon
*NL*
they
glided
the
silent
roads
about
Princeton
and
talked
from
the
surface
*NL*
of
their
hearts
in
shy
excitement
.
Amory
felt
strangely
ingenuous
and
*NL*
made
no
attempt
to
kiss
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Next
day
they
rode
up
through
the
Jersey
country
,
had
luncheon
in
New
*NL*
York
,
and
in
the
afternoon
went
to
see
a
problem
play
at
which
Isabelle
*NL*
wept
all
through
the
second
act
,
rather
to
Amory
's
embarrassment
--
though
*NL*
it
filled
him
with
tenderness
to
watch
her
.
He
was
tempted
to
lean
over
*NL*
and
kiss
away
her
tears
,
and
she
slipped
her
hand
into
his
under
cover
*NL*
of
darkness
to
be
pressed
softly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
at
six
they
arrived
at
the
Borges
'
summer
place
on
Long
Island
,
and
*NL*
Amory
rushed
up-stairs
to
change
into
a
dinner
coat
.
As
he
put
in
his
*NL*
studs
he
realized
that
he
was
enjoying
life
as
he
would
probably
never
*NL*
enjoy
it
again
.
Everything
was
hallowed
by
the
haze
of
his
own
youth
.
He
*NL*
had
arrived
,
abreast
of
the
best
in
his
generation
at
Princeton
.
He
was
*NL*
in
love
and
his
love
was
returned
.
Turning
on
all
the
lights
,
he
looked
*NL*
at
himself
in
the
mirror
,
trying
to
find
in
his
own
face
the
qualities
*NL*
that
made
him
see
clearer
than
the
great
crowd
of
people
,
that
made
him
*NL*
decide
firmly
,
and
able
to
influence
and
follow
his
own
will
.
There
was
*NL*
little
in
his
life
now
that
he
would
have
changed
.
...
Oxford
might
have
*NL*
been
a
bigger
field
.
*NL*
*NL*
Silently
he
admired
himself
.
How
conveniently
well
he
looked
,
and
how
*NL*
well
a
dinner
coat
became
him
.
He
stepped
into
the
hall
and
then
*NL*
waited
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
,
for
he
heard
footsteps
coming
.
It
was
*NL*
Isabelle
,
and
from
the
top
of
her
shining
hair
to
her
little
golden
*NL*
slippers
she
had
never
seemed
so
beautiful
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Isabelle
!
''
he
cried
,
half
involuntarily
,
and
held
out
his
arms
.
As
in
*NL*
the
story-books
,
she
ran
into
them
,
and
on
that
half-minute
,
as
their
*NL*
lips
first
touched
,
rested
the
high
point
of
vanity
,
the
crest
of
his
*NL*
young
egotism
.
*NL*

*NL*
CHAPTER
3
.
The
Egotist
Considers
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ouch
!
Let
me
go
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
dropped
his
arms
to
his
sides
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
matter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
shirt
stud
--
it
hurt
me
--
look
!
''
She
was
looking
down
at
her
neck
,
*NL*
where
a
little
blue
spot
about
the
size
of
a
pea
marred
its
pallor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Isabelle
,
''
he
reproached
himself
,
``
I
'm
a
goopher
.
Really
,
I
'm
*NL*
sorry
--
I
should
n't
have
held
you
so
close
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
up
impatiently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Amory
,
of
course
you
could
n't
help
it
,
and
it
did
n't
hurt
much
;
but
*NL*
what
_
are
_
we
going
to
do
about
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Do
_
about
it
?
''
he
asked
.
``
Oh
--
that
spot
;
it
'll
disappear
in
a
second
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
n't
,
''
she
said
,
after
a
moment
of
concentrated
gazing
,
``
it
's
still
*NL*
there
--
and
it
looks
like
Old
Nick
--
oh
,
Amory
,
what
'll
we
do
!
It
's
_
just
_
*NL*
the
height
of
your
shoulder
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Massage
it
,
''
he
suggested
,
repressing
the
faintest
inclination
to
*NL*
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
rubbed
it
delicately
with
the
tips
of
her
fingers
,
and
then
a
tear
*NL*
gathered
in
the
corner
of
her
eye
,
and
slid
down
her
cheek
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Amory
,
''
she
said
despairingly
,
lifting
up
a
most
pathetic
face
,
*NL*
``
I
'll
just
make
my
whole
neck
_
flame
_
if
I
rub
it
.
What
'll
I
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
quotation
sailed
into
his
head
and
he
could
n't
resist
repeating
it
*NL*
aloud
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
the
perfumes
of
Arabia
will
not
whiten
this
little
hand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
up
and
the
sparkle
of
the
tear
in
her
eye
was
like
ice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
not
very
sympathetic
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
mistook
her
meaning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Isabelle
,
darling
,
I
think
it
'll
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
touch
me
!
''
she
cried
.
``
Have
n't
I
enough
on
my
mind
and
you
stand
*NL*
there
and
_
laugh
!
_
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
slipped
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
it
_
is
_
funny
,
Isabelle
,
and
we
were
talking
the
other
day
about
*NL*
a
sense
of
humor
being
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
looking
at
him
with
something
that
was
not
a
smile
,
rather
the
*NL*
faint
,
mirthless
echo
of
a
smile
,
in
the
corners
of
her
mouth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
shut
up
!
''
she
cried
suddenly
,
and
fled
down
the
hallway
toward
her
*NL*
room
.
Amory
stood
there
,
covered
with
remorseful
confusion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Damn
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
Isabelle
reappeared
she
had
thrown
a
light
wrap
about
her
*NL*
shoulders
,
and
they
descended
the
stairs
in
a
silence
that
endured
*NL*
through
dinner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Isabelle
,
''
he
began
rather
testily
,
as
they
arranged
themselves
in
the
*NL*
car
,
bound
for
a
dance
at
the
Greenwich
Country
Club
,
``
you
're
angry
,
and
*NL*
I
'll
be
,
too
,
in
a
minute
.
Let
's
kiss
and
make
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabelle
considered
glumly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hate
to
be
laughed
at
,
''
she
said
finally
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wo
n't
laugh
any
more
.
I
'm
not
laughing
now
,
am
I
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
did
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
do
n't
be
so
darned
feminine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
lips
curled
slightly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
be
anything
I
want
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
kept
his
temper
with
difficulty
.
He
became
aware
that
he
had
not
*NL*
an
ounce
of
real
affection
for
Isabelle
,
but
her
coldness
piqued
him
.
He
*NL*
wanted
to
kiss
her
,
kiss
her
a
lot
,
because
then
he
knew
he
could
leave
*NL*
in
the
morning
and
not
care
.
On
the
contrary
,
if
he
did
n't
kiss
her
,
it
*NL*
would
worry
him
...
It
would
interfere
vaguely
with
his
idea
of
himself
*NL*
as
a
conqueror
.
It
was
n't
dignified
to
come
off
second
best
,
_
pleading
_
,
*NL*
with
a
doughty
warrior
like
Isabelle
.
*NL*
*NL*
Perhaps
she
suspected
this
.
At
any
rate
,
Amory
watched
the
night
that
*NL*
should
have
been
the
consummation
of
romance
glide
by
with
great
moths
*NL*
overhead
and
the
heavy
fragrance
of
roadside
gardens
,
but
without
those
*NL*
broken
words
,
those
little
sighs
...
*NL*
*NL*
Afterward
they
suppered
on
ginger
ale
and
devil
's
food
in
the
pantry
,
*NL*

Amory
announced
a
decision
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
leaving
early
in
the
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
not
?
''
he
countered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
no

*NL*
*NL*
``
However

I
'm
going

``
Well

insist
on
being
ridiculous

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
do
n't
put
it
that
way

he
objected
.
*NL*
*NL*

just
because
I
wo
n't
let
you
kiss
me

Do
you
think

*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Isabelle
,
''
he
interrupted
,
``
you
know
it
's
not
that
--
even
*NL*
suppose
it
is
.
We
've
reached
the
stage
where
we
either
ought
to
*NL*
kiss
--
or
--
or
--
nothing

It
is
n't
as
if
you
were
refusing
on
moral
*NL*
grounds

*NL*
*NL*
She
hesitated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
really
do
n't
know
what
to
think
about
you

she
began
,
in
a
feeble
,
*NL*
perverse
attempt
at
conciliation
.
``
You
're
so
funny

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
thought
you
had
a
lot
of
self-confidence
and
all
that
;
remember
*NL*
you
told
me
the
other
day
that
you
could
do
anything
you
wanted
,
or
get
*NL*
anything
you
wanted
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
flushed
.
He
_
had
_
told
her
a
lot
of
things
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
did
n't
seem
to
feel
so
self-confident
to-night
.
Maybe
you
're
*NL*
just
plain
conceited
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

I
'm
not

''
he
hesitated
.
``
At
Princeton

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you

Princeton

You
'd
think
that

talk

Perhaps
you
_
can
_
write
better
than
anybody
else
on
your
old
*NL*
Princetonian

maybe
the
freshmen

do

important

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
understand

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
do

''
she
interrupted
.
``
I
_
do

,
because
you
're
always
talking
*NL*
about
yourself

I
used
to
like
it

now
I
do
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
I
to-night
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
just
the
point
,
''
insisted
Isabelle
.
``
You
got
all
upset
to-night

*NL*
You
just
sat
and
watched
my
eyes

Besides
,
I
have
to
think
all
the
time
*NL*
I
'm
talking
to
you
--
you
're
so
critical
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
make
you
think
,
do
I
?
''
Amory
repeated
with
a
touch
of
vanity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
a
nervous
strain
''
--
this
emphatically
--
``
and
when
you
analyze
*NL*
every
little
emotion
and
instinct
I
just
do
n't
have
'em
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
.
''
Amory
admitted
her
point
and
shook
his
head
helplessly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
's
go
.
''
She
stood
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
rose
abstractedly
and
they
walked
to
the
foot
of
the
stairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
train
can
I
get
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
one
about
9:11
if
you
really
must
go

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
've
got
to
go
,
really
.
Good
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
,
and
as
Amory
turned
into
his
room
*NL*
he
thought
he
caught
just
the
faintest
cloud
of
discontent
in
her
face
.
*NL*
He
lay
awake
in
the
darkness
and
wondered
how
much
he
cared
--
how
much
*NL*
of
his
sudden
unhappiness
was
hurt
vanity
--
whether
he
was
,
after
all
,
*NL*
temperamentally
unfitted
for
romance
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
awoke
,
it
was
with
a
glad
flood
of
consciousness
.
The
early
wind
*NL*
stirred
the
chintz
curtains
at
the
windows
and
he
was
idly
puzzled
not
*NL*
to
be
in
his
room
at
Princeton
with
his
school
football
picture
over
*NL*
the
bureau
and
the
Triangle
Club
on
the
wall
opposite
.
Then
the
*NL*
grandfather
's
clock
in
the
hall
outside
struck
eight
,
and
the
memory
*NL*
of
the
night
before
came
to
him
.
He
was
out
of
bed
,
dressing
,
like
the
*NL*
wind
;
he
must
get
out
of
the
house
before
he
saw
Isabelle
.
What
had
*NL*
seemed
a
melancholy
happening
,
now
seemed
a
tiresome
anticlimax
.
He
was
*NL*
dressed
at
half
past
,
so
he
sat
down
by
the
window
;
felt
that
the
sinews
*NL*
of
his
heart
were
twisted
somewhat
more
than
he
had
thought
.
What
an
*NL*
ironic
mockery
the
morning
seemed
!
--
bright
and
sunny
,
and
full
of
the
*NL*
smell
of
the
garden
;
hearing
Mrs.
Borge
's
voice
in
the
sun-parlor
below
,
*NL*
he
wondered
where
was
Isabelle
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
knock
at
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
car
will
be
around
at
ten
minutes
of
nine
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
returned
to
his
contemplation
of
the
outdoors
,
and
began
repeating
*NL*
over
and
over
,
mechanically
,
a
verse
from
Browning
,
which
he
had
once
*NL*
quoted
to
Isabelle
in
a
letter
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Each
life
unfulfilled
,
you
see
,
*NL*
It
hangs
still
,
patchy
and
scrappy
;
*NL*
We
have
not
sighed
deep
,
laughed
free
,
*NL*
Starved
,
feasted
,
despaired
--
been
happy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
But
his
life
would
not
be
unfulfilled
.
He
took
a
sombre
satisfaction
in
*NL*
thinking
that
perhaps
all
along
she
had
been
nothing
except
what
he
had
*NL*
read
into
her
;
that
this
was
her
high
point
,
that
no
one
else
would
ever
*NL*
make
her
think
.
Yet
that
was
what
she
had
objected
to
in
him
;
and
Amory
*NL*
was
suddenly
tired
of
thinking
,
thinking
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Damn
her
!
''
he
said
bitterly
,
``
she
's
spoiled
my
year
!

THE
SUPERMAN
GROWS
CARELESS
*NL*
*NL*
On
a
dusty
day
in
September
Amory
arrived
in
Princeton
and
joined
the
*NL*
sweltering
crowd
of
conditioned
men
who
thronged
the
streets
.
It
seemed
*NL*
a
stupid
way
to
commence
his
upper-class
years
,
to
spend
four
hours
a
*NL*
morning
in
the
stuffy
room
of
a
tutoring
school
,
imbibing
the
infinite
*NL*
boredom
of
conic
sections
.
Mr.
Rooney
,
pander
to
the
dull
,
conducted
the
*NL*
class
and
smoked
innumerable
Pall
Malls
as
he
drew
diagrams
and
worked
*NL*
equations
from
six
in
the
morning
until
midnight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Langueduc
,
if
I
used
that
formula
,
where
would
my
A
point
be
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Langueduc
lazily
shifts
his
six-foot-three
of
football
material
and
*NL*
tries
to
concentrate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
--
ah
--
I
'm
damned
if
I
know
,
Mr.
Rooney
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
why
of
course
,
of
course
you
ca
n't
_
use
_
that
formula
.
_
That
's
_
*NL*
what
I
wanted
you
to
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
sure
,
of
course
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
see
why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
bet
--
I
suppose
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
do
n't
see
,
tell
me
.
I
'm
here
to
show
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Mr.
Rooney
,
if
you
do
n't
mind
,
I
wish
you
'd
go
over
that
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gladly
.
Now
here
's
`
A
'
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
room
was
a
study
in
stupidity
--
two
huge
stands
for
paper
,
Mr.
Rooney
*NL*
in
his
shirt-sleeves
in
front
of
them
,
and
slouched
around
on
chairs
,
*NL*
a
dozen
men
:
Fred
Sloane
,
the
pitcher
,
who
absolutely
_
had
_
to
get
*NL*
eligible
;
``
Slim
''
Langueduc
,
who
would
beat
Yale
this
fall
,
if
only
he
*NL*
could
master
a
poor
fifty
per
cent
;
McDowell
,
gay
young
sophomore
,
who
*NL*
thought
it
was
quite
a
sporting
thing
to
be
tutoring
here
with
all
these
*NL*
prominent
athletes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Those
poor
birds
who
have
n't
a
cent
to
tutor
,
and
have
to
study
during
*NL*
the
term
are
the
ones
I
pity
,
''
he
announced
to
Amory
one
day
,
with
a
*NL*
flaccid
camaraderie
in
the
droop
of
the
cigarette
from
his
pale
lips
.
``
I
*NL*
should
think
it
would
be
such
a
bore
,
there
's
so
much
else
to
do
in
New
*NL*
York
during
the
term
.
I
suppose
they
do
n't
know
what
they
miss
,
anyhow
.
''
*NL*
There
was
such
an
air
of
``
you
and
I
''
about
Mr.
McDowell
that
Amory
very
*NL*
nearly
pushed
him
out
of
the
open
window
when
he
said
this
.
...
Next
*NL*
February
his
mother
would
wonder
why
he
did
n't
make
a
club
and
increase
*NL*
his
allowance
...
simple
little
nut
...
*NL*
*NL*
Through
the
smoke
and
the
air
of
solemn
,
dense
earnestness
that
filled
*NL*
the
room
would
come
the
inevitable
helpless
cry
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
get
it
!
Repeat
that
,
Mr.
Rooney
!
''
Most
of
them
were
so
stupid
*NL*
or
careless
that
they
would
n't
admit
when
they
did
n't
understand
,
and
*NL*
Amory
was
of
the
latter
.
He
found
it
impossible
to
study
conic
sections
;
*NL*
something
in
their
calm
and
tantalizing
respectability
breathing
*NL*
defiantly
through
Mr.
Rooney
's
fetid
parlors
distorted
their
equations
*NL*
into
insoluble
anagrams
.
He
made
a
last
night
's
effort
with
the
*NL*
proverbial
wet
towel
,
and
then
blissfully
took
the
exam
,
wondering
*NL*
unhappily
why
all
the
color
and
ambition
of
the
spring
before
had
faded
*NL*
out
.
Somehow
,
with
the
defection
of
Isabelle
the
idea
of
undergraduate
*NL*
success
had
loosed
its
grasp
on
his
imagination
,
and
he
contemplated
a
*NL*
possible
failure
to
pass
off
his
condition
with
equanimity
,
even
though
*NL*
it
would
arbitrarily
mean
his
removal
from
the
Princetonian
board
and
*NL*
the
slaughter
of
his
chances
for
the
Senior
Council
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
always
his
luck
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
yawned
,
scribbled
his
honor
pledge
on
the
cover
,
and
sauntered
from
*NL*
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
do
n't
pass
it
,
''
said
the
newly
arrived
Alec
as
they
sat
on
the
*NL*
window-seat
of
Amory
's
room
and
mused
upon
a
scheme
of
wall
decoration
,
*NL*
``
you
're
the
world
's
worst
goopher
.
Your
stock
will
go
down
like
an
*NL*
elevator
at
the
club
and
on
the
campus
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
hell
,
I
know
it
.
Why
rub
it
in
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
'Cause
you
deserve
it
.
Anybody
that
'd
risk
what
you
were
in
line
for
*NL*
_
ought
_
to
be
ineligible
for
Princetonian
chairman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
drop
the
subject
,
''
Amory
protested
.
``
Watch
and
wait
and
shut
up
.
*NL*
I
do
n't
want
every
one
at
the
club
asking
me
about
it
,
as
if
I
were
a
*NL*
prize
potato
being
fattened
for
a
vegetable
show
.
''
One
evening
a
week
*NL*
later
Amory
stopped
below
his
own
window
on
the
way
to
Renwick
's
,
and
,
*NL*
seeing
a
light
,
called
up
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Tom
,
any
mail
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alec
's
head
appeared
against
the
yellow
square
of
light
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
your
result
's
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
heart
clamored
violently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
,
blue
or
pink
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
know
.
Better
come
up

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
walked
into
the
room
and
straight
over
to
the
table
,
and
then
*NL*
suddenly
noticed
that
there
were
other
people
in
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Lo
,
Kerry
.
''
He
was
most
polite
.
``
Ah
,
men
of
Princeton
.
''
They
seemed
*NL*
to
be
mostly
friends
,
so
he
picked
up
the
envelope
marked
``
Registrar
's
*NL*
Office
,
''
and
weighed
it
nervously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
here
quite
a
slip
of
paper
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Open
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
to
be
dramatic

I
'll
let
you
know
that
if
it

my
name

withdrawn
from
the
editorial
board
of
the
Prince
,
and
my
short
career
is
*NL*
over

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
paused
,
and
then
saw
for
the
first
time
Ferrenby
's
eyes
,
wearing
a
*NL*
hungry
look
and
watching
him
eagerly
.
Amory
returned
the
gaze
pointedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Watch
my
face
,
gentlemen
,
for
the
primitive
emotions

*NL*
*NL*
He
tore
it
open
and
held
the
slip
up
to
the
light
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
There
was
a
pause
...
a
small
crowd
of
seconds
swept
by
...
then
he
looked
*NL*
again
and
another
crowd
went
on
into
time
.

AFTERMATH
*NL*
*NL*
What
Amory
did
that
year
from
early
September
to
late
in
the
spring
was
*NL*
so
purposeless
and
inconsecutive
that
it
seems
scarcely
worth
recording
.
*NL*
He
was
,
of
course
,
immediately
sorry
for
what
he
had
lost
.
His
*NL*
philosophy
of
success
had
tumbled
down
upon
him
,
and
he
looked
for
the
*NL*
reasons
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
own
laziness

said
Alec

*NL*
*NL*
Amory
's
point
of
view
,
though
dangerous
,
was
not
far
from
the
true
one
.
*NL*
If
his
reactions
to
his
environment
could
be
tabulated
,
the
chart
would
*NL*
have
appeared
like
this
,
beginning
with
his

had
been
his

The

rebellious
,
had
been
nearly
snowed
*NL*
under

He
had
conformed
,
he
had
succeeded
,
but
as
his
imagination
was
*NL*
neither
satisfied
nor
grasped
by
his
own

he
had
listlessly
,
*NL*
half-accidentally
chucked
the
whole

and
become

*NL*
His
father
died
quietly
and
inconspicuously
at
Thanksgiving
.
The
*NL*
incongruity
of
death
with
either
the
beauties
of
Lake
Geneva
or
with
his
*NL*
mother
's
dignified
,
reticent
attitude
diverted
him
,
and
he
looked
at
the
*NL*
funeral
with
an
amused
tolerance
.
He
decided
that
burial
was
after
all
*NL*
preferable
to
cremation
,
and
he
smiled
at
his
old
boyhood
choice
,
*NL*
slow
oxidation
in
the
top
of
a
tree
.
The
day
after
the
ceremony
he
*NL*
was
amusing
himself
in
the
great
library
by
sinking
back
on
a
couch
in
*NL*
graceful
mortuary
attitudes
,
trying
to
determine
whether
he
would
,
when
*NL*
his
day
came
,
be
found
with
his
arms
crossed
piously
over
his
chest
*NL*
-LRB-
Monsignor
Darcy
had
once
advocated
this
posture
as
being
the
most
*NL*
distinguished
-RRB-
,
or
with
his
hands
clasped
behind
his
head
,
a
more
pagan
*NL*
and
Byronic
attitude
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
interested
him
much
more
than
the
final
departure
of
his
father
*NL*
from
things
mundane
was
a
tri-cornered
conversation
between
Beatrice
,
*NL*
Mr.
Barton
,
of
Barton
and
Krogman
,
their
lawyers
,
and
himself
,
that
took
*NL*
place
several
days
after
the
funeral
.
For
the
first
time
he
came
into
*NL*
actual
cognizance
of
the
family
finances
,
and
realized
what
a
tidy
*NL*
fortune
had
once
been
under
his
father
's
management
.
He
took
a
*NL*
ledger
labelled
``
1906
''
and
ran
through
it
rather
carefully
.
The
total
*NL*
expenditure
that
year
had
come
to
something
over
one
hundred
and
ten
*NL*
thousand
dollars
.
Forty
thousand
of
this
had
been
Beatrice
's
own
income
,
*NL*
and
there
had
been
no
attempt
to
account
for
it
:
it
was
all
under
the
*NL*
heading
,
``
Drafts
,
checks
,
and
letters
of
credit
forwarded
to
Beatrice
*NL*
Blaine
.
''
The
dispersal
of
the
rest
was
rather
minutely
itemized
:
the
*NL*
taxes
and
improvements
on
the
Lake
Geneva
estate
had
come
to
almost
nine
*NL*
thousand
dollars
;
the
general
up-keep
,
including
Beatrice
's
electric
and
*NL*
a
French
car
,
bought
that
year
,
was
over
thirty-five
thousand
dollars
.
*NL*
The
rest
was
fully
taken
care
of
,
and
there
were
invariably
items
which
*NL*
failed
to
balance
on
the
right
side
of
the
ledger
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
volume
for
1912
Amory
was
shocked
to
discover
the
decrease
in
the
*NL*
number
of
bond
holdings
and
the
great
drop
in
the
income
.
In
the
case
of
*NL*
Beatrice
's
money
this
was
not
so
pronounced
,
but
it
was
obvious
that
his
*NL*
father
had
devoted
the
previous
year
to
several
unfortunate
gambles
in
*NL*
oil
.
Very
little
of
the
oil
had
been
burned
,
but
Stephen
Blaine
had
*NL*
been
rather
badly
singed
.
The
next
year
and
the
next
and
the
next
showed
*NL*
similar
decreases
,
and
Beatrice
had
for
the
first
time
begun
using
her
*NL*
own
money
for
keeping
up
the
house
.
Yet
her
doctor
's
bill
for
1913
had
*NL*
been
over
nine
thousand
dollars
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
the
exact
state
of
things
Mr.
Barton
was
quite
vague
and
confused
.
*NL*
There
had
been
recent
investments
,
the
outcome
of
which
was
for
*NL*
the
present
problematical
,
and
he
had
an
idea
there
were
further
*NL*
speculations
and
exchanges
concerning
which
he
had
not
been
consulted
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
for
several
months
that
Beatrice
wrote
Amory
the
full
*NL*
situation
.
The
entire
residue
of
the
Blaine
and
O'Hara
fortunes
*NL*
consisted
of
the
place
at
Lake
Geneva
and
approximately
a
half
million
*NL*
dollars
,
invested
now
in
fairly
conservative
six-per-cent
holdings
.
In
*NL*
fact
,
Beatrice
wrote
that
she
was
putting
the
money
into
railroad
and
*NL*
street-car
bonds
as
fast
as
she
could
conveniently
transfer
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
quite
sure
,
''
she
wrote
to
Amory
,
``
that
if
there
is
one
*NL*
thing
we
can
be
positive
of
,
it
is
that
people
will
not
stay
in
*NL*
one
place
.
This
Ford
person
has
certainly
made
the
most
of
that
*NL*
idea
.
So
I
am
instructing
Mr.
Barton
to
specialize
on
such
things
*NL*
as
Northern
Pacific
and
these
Rapid
Transit
Companies
,
as
they
*NL*
call
the
street-cars
.
I
shall
never
forgive
myself
for
not
buying
*NL*
Bethlehem
Steel
.
I
've
heard
the
most
fascinating
stories
.
You
*NL*
must
go
into
finance
,
Amory
.
I
'm
sure
you
would
revel
in
it
.
*NL*
You
start
as
a
messenger
or
a
teller
,
I
believe
,
and
from
that
you
*NL*
go
up
--
almost
indefinitely
.
I
'm
sure
if
I
were
a
man
I
'd
love
the
*NL*
handling
of
money
;
it
has
become
quite
a
senile
passion
with
me
.
*NL*
Before
I
get
any
farther
I
want
to
discuss
something
.
A
Mrs.
Bispam
,
*NL*
an
overcordial
little
lady
whom
I
met
at
a
tea
the
other
day
,
*NL*
told
me
that
her
son
,
he
is
at
Yale
,
wrote
her
that
all
the
*NL*
boys
there
wore
their
summer
underwear
all
during
the
winter
,
*NL*
and
also
went
about
with
their
heads
wet
and
in
low
shoes
on
the
*NL*
coldest
days
.
Now
,
Amory
,
I
do
n't
know
whether
that
is
a
fad
at
*NL*
Princeton
too
,
but
I
do
n't
want
you
to
be
so
foolish
.
It
not
only
*NL*
inclines
a
young
man
to
pneumonia
and
infantile
paralysis
,
but
to
*NL*
all
forms
of
lung
trouble
,
to
which
you
are
particularly
*NL*
inclined
.
You
can
not
experiment
with
your
health
.
I
have
found
*NL*
that
out
.
I
will
not
make
myself
ridiculous
as
some
mothers
no
*NL*
doubt
do
,
by
insisting
that
you
wear
overshoes
,
though
I
remember
*NL*
one
Christmas
you
wore
them
around
constantly
without
a
single
*NL*
buckle
latched
,
making
such
a
curious
swishing
sound
,
and
you
*NL*
refused
to
buckle
them
because
it
was
not
the
thing
to
do
.
The
*NL*
very
next
Christmas
you
would
not
wear
even
rubbers
,
though
I
*NL*
begged
you
.
You
are
nearly
twenty
years
old
now
,
dear
,
and
I
*NL*
ca
n't
be
with
you
constantly
to
find
whether
you
are
doing
the
*NL*
sensible
thing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
has
been
a
very
_
practical
_
letter
.
I
warned
you
in
my
last
*NL*
that
the
lack
of
money
to
do
the
things
one
wants
to
makes
one
*NL*
quite
prosy
and
domestic
,
but
there
is
still
plenty
for
*NL*
everything
if
we
are
not
too
extravagant
.
Take
care
of
yourself
,
*NL*
my
dear
boy
,
and
do
try
to
write
at
least
_
once
_
a
week
,
because
I
*NL*
imagine
all
sorts
of
horrible
things
if
I
do
n't
hear
from
you
.

FIRST

TERM
``
PERSONAGE
''
*NL*
*NL*
Monsignor
Darcy
invited
Amory
up
to
the
Stuart
palace
on
the
Hudson
for
*NL*
a
week
at
Christmas
,
and
they
had
enormous
conversations
around
the
open
*NL*
fire
.
Monsignor
was
growing
a
trifle
stouter
and
his
personality
had
*NL*
expanded
even
with
that
,
and
Amory
felt
both
rest
and
security
in
*NL*
sinking
into
a
squat
,
cushioned
chair
and
joining
him
in
the
middle-aged
*NL*
sanity
of
a
cigar
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
felt
like
leaving
college

Monsignor
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

*NL*
*NL*
``
All
my
career
's
gone

all
that

*NL*
but
--

*NL*
*NL*
``
Not

it

Everything
you
've
been
doing

I
saw
you
last

*NL*
*NL*
Amory
talked
;
he
went
thoroughly
into
the
destruction
of
his
egotistic
*NL*
highways
,
and
in
a
half-hour
the
listless
quality
had
left
his
voice

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
would
you
do
if
you
left

asked
Monsignor
.

``
Do
n't
know

I
'd
like

travel

this
tiresome

Amory
reluctantly

Now
a
personage
,
on
the
other
hand
,
gathers
.
He
is
never
thought
*NL*
of
apart
from
what
he
's
done
.
He
's
a
bar
on
which
a
thousand
things
have
*NL*
been
hung
--
glittering
things
sometimes
,
as
ours
are
;
but
he
uses
those
*NL*
things
with
a
cold
mentality
back
of
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
several
of
my
most
glittering
possessions
had
fallen
off
when
I
*NL*
needed
them
.
''
Amory
continued
the
simile
eagerly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
that
's
it
;
when
you
feel
that
your
garnered
prestige
and
talents
*NL*
and
all
that
are
hung
out
,
you
need
never
bother
about
anybody
;
you
can
*NL*
cope
with
them
without
difficulty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
on
the
other
hand
,
if
I
have
n't
my
possessions
,
I
'm
helpless
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Absolutely
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
certainly
an
idea
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
you
've
a
clean
start
--
a
start
Kerry
or
Sloane
can
constitutionally
*NL*
never
have
.
You
brushed
three
or
four
ornaments
down
,
and
,
in
a
fit
of
*NL*
pique
,
knocked
off
the
rest
of
them
.
The
thing
now
is
to
collect
some
*NL*
new
ones
,
and
the
farther
you
look
ahead
in
the
collecting
the
better
.
*NL*
But
remember
,
do
the
next
thing
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
clear
you
can
make
things
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
they
talked
,
often
about
themselves
,
sometimes
of
philosophy
and
*NL*
religion
,
and
life
as
respectively
a
game
or
a
mystery
.
The
priest
*NL*
seemed
to
guess
Amory
's
thoughts
before
they
were
clear
in
his
own
head
,
*NL*
so
closely
related
were
their
minds
in
form
and
groove
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
I
make
lists
?
''
Amory
asked
him
one
night
.
``
Lists
of
all
sorts
of
*NL*
things
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
you
're
a
mediaevalist
,
''
Monsignor
answered
.
``
We
both
are
.
It
's
*NL*
the
passion
for
classifying
and
finding
a
type
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
desire
to
get
something
definite
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
the
nucleus
of
scholastic
philosophy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
beginning
to
think
I
was
growing
eccentric
till
I
came
up
here
.
*NL*
It
was
a
pose
,
I
guess
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
worry
about
that
;
for
you
not
posing
may
be
the
biggest
pose
of
*NL*
all

Pose
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
do
the
next
thing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
Amory
returned
to
college
he
received
several
letters
from
*NL*
Monsignor
which
gave
him
more
egotistic
food
for
consumption
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
am
afraid
that
I
gave
you
too
much
assurance
of
your
inevitable
*NL*
safety
,
and
you
must
remember
that
I
did
that
through
faith
in
*NL*
your
springs
of
effort
;
not
in
the
silly
conviction
that
you
will
*NL*
arrive
without
struggle
.
Some
nuances
of
character
you
will
have
*NL*
to
take
for
granted
in
yourself
,
though
you
must
be
careful
in
*NL*
confessing
them
to
others
.
You
are
unsentimental
,
almost
incapable
*NL*
of
affection
,
astute
without
being
cunning
and
vain
without
being
*NL*
proud
.
*NL*
*NL*
Do
n't
let
yourself
feel
worthless
;
often
through
life
you
will
*NL*
really
be
at
your
worst
when
you
seem
to
think
best
of
yourself
;
*NL*
and
do
n't
worry
about
losing
your
``
personality
,
''
as
you
persist
*NL*
in
calling
it
;
at
fifteen
you
had
the
radiance
of
early
morning
,
*NL*
at
twenty
you
will
begin
to
have
the
melancholy
brilliance
of
*NL*
the
moon
,
and
when
you
are
my
age
you
will
give
out
,
as
I
do
,
*NL*
the
genial
golden
warmth
of
4
P.M.
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
you
write
me
letters
,
please
let
them
be
natural
ones
.
Your
*NL*
last
,
that
dissertation
on
architecture
,
was
perfectly
awful
--
*NL*
so
``
highbrow
''
that
I
picture
you
living
in
an
intellectual
and
*NL*
emotional
vacuum
;
and
beware
of
trying
to
classify
people
too
*NL*
definitely
into
types
;
you
will
find
that
all
through
their
youth
*NL*
they
will
persist
annoyingly
in
jumping
from
class
to
class
,
and
*NL*
by
pasting
a
supercilious
label
on
every
one
you
meet
you
are
*NL*
merely
packing
a
Jack-in-the-box
that
will
spring
up
and
leer
at
*NL*
you
when
you
begin
to
come
into
really
antagonistic
contact
with
*NL*
the
world
.
An
idealization
of
some
such
a
man
as
Leonardo
da
*NL*
Vinci
would
be
a
more
valuable
beacon
to
you
at
present
.
*NL*
*NL*
You
are
bound
to
go
up
and
down
,
just
as
I
did
in
my
youth
,
but
*NL*
do
keep
your
clarity
of
mind
,
and
if
fools
or
sages
dare
to
*NL*
criticise
do
n't
blame
yourself
too
much
.
*NL*
*NL*
You
say
that
convention
is
all
that
really
keeps
you
straight
in
*NL*
this
``
woman
proposition
''
;
but
it
's
more
than
that
,
Amory
;
it
's
*NL*
the
fear
that
what
you
begin
you
ca
n't
stop
;
you
would
run
amuck
,
*NL*
and
I
know
whereof
I
speak
;
it
's
that
half-miraculous
sixth
sense
*NL*
by
which
you
detect
evil
,
it
's
the
half-realized
fear
of
God
in
*NL*
your
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whatever
your
metier
proves
to
be
--
religion
,
architecture
,
*NL*
literature
--
I
'm
sure
you
would
be
much
safer
anchored
to
the
*NL*
Church
,
but
I
wo
n't
risk
my
influence
by
arguing
with
you
even
*NL*
though
I
am
secretly
sure
that
the
``
black
chasm
of
Romanism
''
*NL*
yawns
beneath
you
.
Do
write
me
soon

With
affectionate

THAYER
DARCY
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Even
Amory
's
reading
paled
during
this
period
;
he
delved
further
into
*NL*
the
misty
side
streets
of
literature
:
Huysmans
,
Walter
Pater
,
Theophile
*NL*
Gautier
,
and
the
racier
sections
of
Rabelais
,
Boccaccio
,
Petronius
,
and
*NL*
Suetonius
.
One
week
,
through
general
curiosity
,
he
inspected
the
private
*NL*
libraries
of
his
classmates
and
found
Sloane
's
as
typical
as
any
:
sets
*NL*
of
Kipling
,
O.
Henry
,
John
Fox
,
Jr.
,
and
Richard
Harding
Davis
;
``
What
*NL*
Every
Middle-Aged
Woman
Ought
to
Know
,
''
``
The
Spell
of
the
Yukon
''
;
*NL*
a
``
gift
''
copy
of
James
Whitcomb
Riley
,
an
assortment
of
battered
,
*NL*
annotated
schoolbooks
,
and
,
finally
,
to
his
surprise
,
one
of
his
own
*NL*
late
discoveries
,
the
collected
poems
of
Rupert
Brooke
.
*NL*
*NL*
Together
with
Tom
D'Invilliers
,
he
sought
among
the
lights
of
Princeton
*NL*
for
some
one
who
might
found
the
Great
American
Poetic
Tradition
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
undergraduate
body
itself
was
rather
more
interesting
that
year
than
*NL*
had
been
the
entirely
Philistine
Princeton
of
two
years
before
.
Things
*NL*
had
livened
surprisingly
,
though
at
the
sacrifice
of
much
of
the
*NL*
spontaneous
charm
of
freshman
year
.
In
the
old
Princeton
they
would
*NL*
never
have
discovered
Tanaduke
Wylie
.
Tanaduke
was
a
sophomore
,
with
*NL*
tremendous
ears
and
a
way
of
saying
,
``
The
earth
swirls
down
through
*NL*
the
ominous
moons
of
preconsidered
generations
!
''
that
made
them
vaguely
*NL*
wonder
why
it
did
not
sound
quite
clear
,
but
never
question
that
it
was
*NL*
the
utterance
of
a
supersoul
.
At
least
so
Tom
and
Amory
took
him
.
They
*NL*
told
him
in
all
earnestness
that
he
had
a
mind
like
Shelley
's
,
and
*NL*
featured
his
ultrafree
free
verse
and
prose
poetry
in
the
Nassau
*NL*
Literary
Magazine
.
But
Tanaduke
's
genius
absorbed
the
many
colors
of
the
*NL*
age
,
and
he
took
to
the
Bohemian
life
,
to
their
great
disappointment
.
He
*NL*
talked
of
Greenwich
Village
now
instead
of
``
noon-swirled
moons
,
''
and
*NL*
met
winter
muses
,
unacademic
,
and
cloistered
by
Forty-second
Street
*NL*
and
Broadway
,
instead
of
the
Shelleyan
dream-children
with
whom
he
had
*NL*
regaled
their
expectant
appreciation
.
So
they
surrendered
Tanaduke
to
*NL*
the
futurists
,
deciding
that
he
and
his
flaming
ties
would
do
better
*NL*
there
.
Tom
gave
him
the
final
advice
that
he
should
stop
writing
for
two
*NL*
years
and
read
the
complete
works
of
Alexander
Pope
four
times
,
but
on
*NL*
Amory
's
suggestion
that
Pope
for
Tanaduke
was
like
foot-ease
for
stomach
*NL*
trouble
,
they
withdrew
in
laughter
,
and
called
it
a
coin
's
toss
whether
*NL*
this
genius
was
too
big
or
too
petty
for
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
rather
scornfully
avoided
the
popular
professors
who
dispensed
*NL*
easy
epigrams
and
thimblefuls
of
Chartreuse
to
groups
of
admirers
every
*NL*
night
.
He
was
disappointed
,
too
,
at
the
air
of
general
uncertainty
on
*NL*
every
subject
that
seemed
linked
with
the
pedantic
temperament
;
his
*NL*
opinions
took
shape
in
a
miniature
satire
called
``
In
a
Lecture-Room
,
''
*NL*
which
he
persuaded
Tom
to
print
in
the
Nassau
Lit
.

In

Kerry
Holiday
left
college

sailed
for
France
to
enroll
in
*NL*
the
Lafayette
Esquadrille
.
Amory
's
envy
and
admiration
of
this
step
*NL*
was
drowned
in
an
experience
of
his
own
to
which
he
never
succeeded
in
*NL*
giving
an
appropriate
value
,
but
which
,
nevertheless
,
haunted

from

Fred

Amory

The

was

felt
ridiculous
with

energy

burst
into
the

like

jostled
behind

a

to

at

``

*NL*
*NL*
``

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
crowd
whirled
and
changed
and
shifted
.
They
were
mostly
from
the
*NL*
colleges
,
with
a
scattering
of
the
male
refuse
of
Broadway
,
and
women
of
*NL*
two
types
,
the
higher
of
which
was
the
chorus
girl
.
On
the
whole
it
was
*NL*
a
typical
crowd
,
and
their
party
as
typical
as
any
.
About
three-fourths
*NL*
of
the
whole
business
was
for
effect
and
therefore
harmless
,
ended
at
*NL*
the
door
of
the
cafe
,
soon
enough
for
the
five-o'clock
train
back
to
*NL*
Yale
or
Princeton
;
about
one-fourth
continued
on
into
the
dimmer
hours
*NL*
and
gathered
strange
dust
from
strange
places
.
Their
party
was
scheduled
*NL*
to
be
one
of
the
harmless
kind
.
Fred
Sloane
and
Phoebe
Column
were
old
*NL*
friends
;
Axia
and
Amory
new
ones
.
But
strange
things
are
prepared
even
*NL*
in
the
dead
of
night
,
and
the
unusual
,
which
lurks
least
in
the
cafe
,
*NL*
home
of
the
prosaic
and
inevitable
,
was
preparing
to
spoil
for
him
*NL*
the
waning
romance
of
Broadway
.
The
way
it
took
was
so
inexpressibly
*NL*
terrible
,
so
unbelievable
,
that
afterward
he
never
thought
of
it
as
*NL*
experience
;
but
it
was
a
scene
from
a
misty
tragedy
,
played
far
behind
*NL*
the
veil
,
and
that
it
meant
something
definite
he
knew
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
one
o'clock
they
moved
to
Maxim
's
,
and
two
found
them
in
*NL*
Deviniere
's
.
Sloane
had
been
drinking
consecutively
and
was
in
a
state
*NL*
of
unsteady
exhilaration
,
but
Amory
was
quite
tiresomely
sober
;
they
*NL*
had
run
across
none
of
those
ancient
,
corrupt
buyers
of
champagne
who
*NL*
usually
assisted
their
New
York
parties
.
They
were
just
through
dancing
*NL*
and
were
making
their
way
back
to
their
chairs
when
Amory
became
aware
*NL*
that
some
one
at
a
near-by
table
was
looking
at
him
.
He
turned
and
*NL*
glanced
casually
...
a
middle-aged
man
dressed
in
a
brown
sack
suit
,
it
*NL*
was
,
sitting
a
little
apart
at
a
table
by
himself
and
watching
their
*NL*
party
intently
.
At
Amory
's
glance
he
smiled
faintly
.
Amory
turned
to
*NL*
Fred
,
who
was
just
sitting
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
's
that
pale
fool
watching
us
?
''
he
complained
indignantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
?
''
cried
Sloane
.
``
We
'll
have
him
thrown
out
!
''
He
rose
to
his
feet
*NL*
and
swayed
back
and
forth
,
clinging
to
his
chair
.
``
Where
is
he
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Axia
and
Phoebe
suddenly
leaned
and
whispered
to
each
other
across
the
*NL*
table
,
and
before
Amory
realized
it
they
found
themselves
on
their
way
*NL*
to
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Up
to
the
flat
,
''
suggested
Phoebe
.
``
We
've
got
brandy
and
fizz
--
and
*NL*
everything
's
slow
down
here
to-night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
considered
quickly
.
He
had
n't
been
drinking
,
and
decided
that
if
*NL*
he
took
no
more
,
it
would
be
reasonably
discreet
for
him
to
trot
along
*NL*
in
the
party
.
In
fact
,
it
would
be
,
perhaps
,
the
thing
to
do
in
order
to
*NL*
keep
an
eye
on
Sloane
,
who
was
not
in
a
state
to
do
his
own
thinking
.
So
*NL*
he
took
Axia
's
arm
and
,
piling
intimately
into
a
taxicab
,
they
drove
out
*NL*
over
the
hundreds
and
drew
up
at
a
tall
,
white-stone
apartment-house
.
*NL*
...
Never
would
he
forget
that
street
...
It
was
a
broad
street
,
lined
*NL*
on
both
sides
with
just
such
tall
,
white-stone
buildings
,
dotted
with
*NL*
dark
windows
;
they
stretched
along
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
,
flooded
*NL*
with
a
bright
moonlight
that
gave
them
a
calcium
pallor
.
He
imagined
*NL*
each
one
to
have
an
elevator
and
a
colored
hall-boy
and
a
key-rack
;
each
*NL*
one
to
be
eight
stories
high
and
full
of
three
and
four
room
suites
.
He
*NL*
was
rather
glad
to
walk
into
the
cheeriness
of
Phoebe
's
living-room
and
*NL*
sink
onto
a
sofa
,
while
the
girls
went
rummaging
for
food
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Phoebe
's
great
stuff
,
''
confided
Sloane
,
sotto
voce
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
only
going
to
stay
half
an
hour
,
''
Amory
said
sternly
.
He
wondered
*NL*
if
it
sounded
priggish
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hell
y
'
say
,
''
protested
Sloane
.
``
We
're
here
now
--
do
n't
le
's
rush
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
like
this
place
,
''
Amory
said
sulkily
,
``
and
I
do
n't
want
any
*NL*
food
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Phoebe
reappeared
with
sandwiches
,
brandy
bottle
,
siphon
,
and
four
*NL*
glasses
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Amory
,
pour
'em
out
,
''
she
said
,
``
and
we
'll
drink
to
Fred
Sloane
,
who
*NL*
has
a
rare
,
distinguished
edge
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Axia
,
coming
in
,
``
and
Amory
.
I
like
Amory
.
''
She
sat
down
*NL*
beside
him
and
laid
her
yellow
head
on
his
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
pour
,
''
said
Sloane
;
``
you
use
siphon
,
Phoebe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
filled
the
tray
with
glasses
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ready
,
here
she
goes
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
hesitated
,
glass
in
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
minute
while
temptation
crept
over
him
like
a
warm
wind
,
*NL*
and
his
imagination
turned
to
fire
,
and
he
took
the
glass
from
Phoebe
's
*NL*
hand
.
That
was
all
;
for
at
the
second
that
his
decision
came
,
he
looked
*NL*
up
and
saw
,
ten
yards
from
him
,
the
man
who
had
been
in
the
cafe
,
and
*NL*
with
his
jump
of
astonishment
the
glass
fell
from
his
uplifted
hand
.
*NL*
There
the
man
half
sat
,
half
leaned
against
a
pile
of
pillows
on
the
*NL*
corner
divan
.
His
face
was
cast
in
the
same
yellow
wax
as
in
the
cafe
,
*NL*
neither
the
dull
,
pasty
color
of
a
dead
man
--
rather
a
sort
of
virile
*NL*
pallor
--
nor
unhealthy
,
you
'd
have
called
it
;
but
like
a
strong
man
who
'd
*NL*
worked
in
a
mine
or
done
night
shifts
in
a
damp
climate
.
Amory
looked
*NL*
him
over
carefully
and
later
he
could
have
drawn
him
after
a
fashion
,
*NL*
down
to
the
merest
details
.
His
mouth
was
the
kind
that
is
called
frank
,
*NL*
and
he
had
steady
gray
eyes
that
moved
slowly
from
one
to
the
other
*NL*
of
their
group
,
with
just
the
shade
of
a
questioning
expression
.
Amory
*NL*
noticed
his
hands
;
they
were
n't
fine
at
all
,
but
they
had
versatility
*NL*
and
a
tenuous
strength
...
they
were
nervous
hands
that
sat
lightly
*NL*
along
the
cushions
and
moved
constantly
with
little
jerky
openings
and
*NL*
closings
.
Then
,
suddenly
,
Amory
perceived
the
feet
,
and
with
a
rush
of
*NL*
blood
to
the
head
he
realized
he
was
afraid
.
The
feet
were
all
wrong
...
*NL*
with
a
sort
of
wrongness
that
he
felt
rather
than
knew
...
It
was
like
*NL*
weakness
in
a
good
woman
,
or
blood
on
satin
;
one
of
those
terrible
*NL*
incongruities
that
shake
little
things
in
the
back
of
the
brain
.
He
wore
*NL*
no
shoes
,
but
,
instead
,
a
sort
of
half
moccasin
,
pointed
,
though
,
like
*NL*
the
shoes
they
wore
in
the
fourteenth
century
,
and
with
the
little
ends
*NL*
curling
up
.
They
were
a
darkish
brown
and
his
toes
seemed
to
fill
them
*NL*
to
the
end
...
They
were
unutterably
terrible
...
*NL*
*NL*
He
must
have
said
something
,
or
looked
something
,
for
Axia
's
voice
came
*NL*
out
of
the
void
with
a
strange
goodness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
look
at
Amory
!
Poor
old
Amory
's
sick
--
old
head
going
`
round
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
at
that
man
!
''
cried
Amory
,
pointing
toward
the
corner
divan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
mean
that
purple
zebra
!
''
shrieked
Axia
facetiously
.
``
Ooo-ee
!
*NL*
Amory
's
got
a
purple
zebra
watching
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sloane
laughed
vacantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ole
zebra
gotcha
,
Amory
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
silence
...
The
man
regarded
Amory
quizzically
...
Then
the
*NL*
human
voices
fell
faintly
on
his
ear
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thought
you
were
n't
drinking
,
''
remarked
Axia
sardonically
,
but
her
*NL*
voice
was
good
to
hear
;
the
whole
divan
that
held
the
man
was
alive
;
*NL*
alive
like
heat
waves
over
asphalt
,
like
wriggling
worms
...
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
back
!
Come
back
!
''
Axia
's
arm
fell
on
his
.
``
Amory
,
dear
,
you
are
n't
*NL*
going
,
Amory
!
''
He
was
half-way
to
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
on
,
Amory
,
stick
`
th
us
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sick
,
are
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sit
down
a
second
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
some
water
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
a
little
brandy
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
elevator
was
close
,
and
the
colored
boy
was
half
asleep
,
paled
to
*NL*
a
livid
bronze
...
Axia
's
beseeching
voice
floated
down
the
shaft
.
Those
*NL*
feet
...
those
feet
...
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
settled
to
the
lower
floor
the
feet
came
into
view
in
the
sickly
*NL*
electric
light
of
the
paved
hall
.
*NL*
*NL*
*****
*NL*
*NL*
IN
THE
ALLEY
*NL*
*NL*
Down
the
long
street
came
the
moon
,
and
Amory
turned
his
back
on
it
and
*NL*
walked
.
Ten
,
fifteen
steps
away
sounded
the
footsteps
.
They
were
like
a
*NL*
slow
dripping
,
with
just
the
slightest
insistence
in
their
fall
.
*NL*
Amory
's
shadow
lay
,
perhaps
,
ten
feet
ahead
of
him
,
and
soft
shoes
was
*NL*
presumably
that
far
behind
.
With
the
instinct
of
a
child
Amory
edged
in
*NL*
under
the
blue
darkness
of
the
white
buildings
,
cleaving
the
moonlight
*NL*
for
haggard
seconds
,
once
bursting
into
a
slow
run
with
clumsy
*NL*
stumblings
.
After
that
he
stopped
suddenly
;
he
must
keep
hold
,
he
*NL*
thought
.
His
lips
were
dry
and
he
licked
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
he
met
any
one
good
--
were
there
any
good
people
left
in
the
world
or
*NL*
did
they
all
live
in
white
apartment-houses
now
?
Was
every
one
followed
*NL*
in
the
moonlight
?
But
if
he
met
some
one
good
who
'd
know
what
he
meant
*NL*
and
hear
this
damned
scuffle
...
then
the
scuffling
grew
suddenly
nearer
,
*NL*
and
a
black
cloud
settled
over
the
moon
.
When
again
the
pale
sheen
*NL*
skimmed
the
cornices
,
it
was
almost
beside
him
,
and
Amory
thought
he
*NL*
heard
a
quiet
breathing
.
Suddenly
he
realized
that
the
footsteps
were
*NL*
not
behind
,
had
never
been
behind
,
they
were
ahead
and
he
was
not
*NL*
eluding
but
following
...
following
.
He
began
to
run
,
blindly
,
his
heart
*NL*
knocking
heavily
,
his
hands
clinched
.
Far
ahead
a
black
dot
showed
*NL*
itself
,
resolved
slowly
into
a
human
shape
.
But
Amory
was
beyond
that
*NL*
now
;
he
turned
off
the
street
and
darted
into
an
alley
,
narrow
and
*NL*
dark
and
smelling
of
old
rottenness
.
He
twisted
down
a
long
,
sinuous
*NL*
blackness
,
where
the
moonlight
was
shut
away
except
for
tiny
glints
*NL*
and
patches
...
then
suddenly
sank
panting
into
a
corner
by
a
fence
,
*NL*
exhausted
.
The
steps
ahead
stopped
,
and
he
could
hear
them
shift
*NL*
slightly
with
a
continuous
motion
,
like
waves
around
a
dock
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
put
his
face
in
his
hands
and
covered
eyes
and
ears
as
well
as
*NL*
he
could
.
During
all
this
time
it
never
occurred
to
him
that
he
was
*NL*
delirious
or
drunk
.
He
had
a
sense
of
reality
such
as
material
things
*NL*
could
never
give
him
.
His
intellectual
content
seemed
to
submit
*NL*
passively
to
it
,
and
it
fitted
like
a
glove
everything
that
had
ever
*NL*
preceded
it
in
his
life
.
It
did
not
muddle
him
.
It
was
like
a
problem
*NL*
whose
answer
he
knew
on
paper
,
yet
whose
solution
he
was
unable
to
*NL*
grasp
.
He
was
far
beyond
horror
.
He
had
sunk
through
the
thin
surface
of
*NL*
that
,
now
moved
in
a
region
where
the
feet
and
the
fear
of
white
walls
*NL*
were
real
,
living
things
,
things
he
must
accept
.
Only
far
inside
his
*NL*
soul
a
little
fire
leaped
and
cried
that
something
was
pulling
him
down
,
*NL*
trying
to
get
him
inside
a
door
and
slam
it
behind
him
.
After
that
door
*NL*
was
slammed
there
would
be
only
footfalls
and
white
buildings
in
the
*NL*
moonlight
,
and
perhaps
he
would
be
one
of
the
footfalls
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
five
or
ten
minutes
he
waited
in
the
shadow
of
the
fence
,
*NL*
there
was
somehow
this
fire
...
that
was
as
near
as
he
could
name
it
*NL*
afterward
.
He
remembered
calling
aloud
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
some
one
stupid
.
Oh
,
send
some
one
stupid
!
''
This
to
the
*NL*
black
fence
opposite
him
,
in
whose
shadows
the
footsteps
shuffled
*NL*
...
shuffled
.
He
supposed
``
stupid
''
and
``
good
''
had
become
somehow
*NL*
intermingled
through
previous
association
.
When
he
called
thus
it
was
*NL*
not
an
act
of
will
at
all
--
will
had
turned
him
away
from
the
moving
*NL*
figure
in
the
street
;
it
was
almost
instinct
that
called
,
just
the
pile
*NL*
on
pile
of
inherent
tradition
or
some
wild
prayer
from
way
over
the
*NL*
night
.
Then
something
clanged
like
a
low
gong
struck
at
a
distance
,
*NL*
and
before
his
eyes
a
face
flashed
over
the
two
feet
,
a
face
pale
and
*NL*
distorted
with
a
sort
of
infinite
evil
that
twisted
it
like
flame
in
*NL*
the
wind
;
_
but
he
knew
,
for
the
half
instant
that
the
gong
tanged
and
*NL*
hummed
,
that
it
was
the
face
of
Dick
Humbird
.
_
*NL*
*NL*
Minutes
later
he
sprang
to
his
feet
,
realizing
dimly
that
there
was
no
*NL*
more
sound
,
and
that
he
was
alone
in
the
graying
alley
.
It
was
cold
,
and
*NL*
he
started
on
a
steady
run
for
the
light
that
showed
the
street
at
the
*NL*
other
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
*****
*NL*
*NL*
AT
THE
WINDOW
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
late
morning
when
he
woke
and
found
the
telephone
beside
his
bed
*NL*
in
the
hotel
tolling
frantically
,
and
remembered
that
he
had
left
word
*NL*
to
be
called
at
eleven
.
Sloane
was
snoring
heavily
,
his
clothes
in
a
*NL*
pile
by
his
bed
.
They
dressed
and
ate
breakfast
in
silence
,
and
then
*NL*
sauntered
out
to
get
some
air
.
Amory
's
mind
was
working
slowly
,
trying
*NL*
to
assimilate
what
had
happened
and
separate
from
the
chaotic
imagery
*NL*
that
stacked
his
memory
the
bare
shreds
of
truth
.
If
the
morning
had
*NL*
been
cold
and
gray
he
could
have
grasped
the
reins
of
the
past
in
an
*NL*
instant
,
but
it
was
one
of
those
days
that
New
York
gets
sometimes
in
*NL*
May
,
when
the
air
on
Fifth
Avenue
is
a
soft
,
light
wine
.
How
much
or
how
*NL*
little
Sloane
remembered
Amory
did
not
care
to
know
;
he
apparently
had
*NL*
none
of
the
nervous
tension
that
was
gripping
Amory
and
forcing
his
mind
*NL*
back
and
forth
like
a
shrieking
saw
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Broadway
broke
upon
them
,
and
with
the
babel
of
noise
and
the
*NL*
painted
faces
a
sudden
sickness
rushed
over
Amory
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
God
's
sake
,
let
's
go
back
!
Let
's
get
off
of
this
--
this
place
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sloane
looked
at
him
in
amazement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
street
,
it
's
ghastly
!
Come
on
!
let
's
get
back
to
the
Avenue
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
mean
to
say
,
''
said
Sloane
stolidly
,
``
that
'cause
you
had
some
*NL*
sort
of
indigestion
that
made
you
act
like
a
maniac
last
night
,
you
're
*NL*
never
coming
on
Broadway
again
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Simultaneously
Amory
classed
him
with
the
crowd
,
and
he
seemed
no
longer
*NL*
Sloane
of
the
debonair
humor
and
the
happy
personality
,
but
only
one
of
*NL*
the
evil
faces
that
whirled
along
the
turbid
stream
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Man
!
''
he
shouted
so
loud
that
the
people
on
the
corner
turned
and
*NL*
followed
them
with
their
eyes
,
``
it
's
filthy
,
and
if
you
ca
n't
see
it
,
*NL*
you
're
filthy
,
too
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
help
it
,
''
said
Sloane
doggedly
.
``
What
's
the
matter
with
you
?
*NL*
Old
remorse
getting
you
?
You
'd
be
in
a
fine
state
if
you
'd
gone
through
*NL*
with
our
little
party
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
going
,
Fred
,
''
said
Amory
slowly
.
His
knees
were
shaking
under
him
,
*NL*
and
he
knew
that
if
he
stayed
another
minute
on
this
street
he
would
*NL*
keel
over
where
he
stood
.
``
I
'll
be
at
the
Vanderbilt
for
lunch
.
''
And
he
*NL*
strode
rapidly
off
and
turned
over
to
Fifth
Avenue
.
Back
at
the
hotel
he
*NL*
felt
better
,
but
as
he
walked
into
the
barber-shop
,
intending
to
get
a
*NL*
head
massage
,
the
smell
of
the
powders
and
tonics
brought
back
Axia
's
*NL*
sidelong
,
suggestive
smile
,
and
he
left
hurriedly
.
In
the
doorway
of
his
*NL*
room
a
sudden
blackness
flowed
around
him
like
a
divided
river
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
came
to
himself
he
knew
that
several
hours
had
passed
.
He
*NL*
pitched
onto
the
bed
and
rolled
over
on
his
face
with
a
deadly
fear
that
*NL*
he
was
going
mad
.
He
wanted
people
,
people
,
some
one
sane
and
stupid
and
*NL*
good
.
He
lay
for
he
knew
not
how
long
without
moving
.
He
could
feel
*NL*
the
little
hot
veins
on
his
forehead
standing
out
,
and
his
terror
had
*NL*
hardened
on
him
like
plaster
.
He
felt
he
was
passing
up
again
through
*NL*
the
thin
crust
of
horror
,
and
now
only
could
he
distinguish
the
shadowy
*NL*
twilight
he
was
leaving
.
He
must
have
fallen
asleep
again
,
for
when
he
*NL*
next
recollected
himself
he
had
paid
the
hotel
bill
and
was
stepping
*NL*
into
a
taxi
at
the
door
.
It
was
raining
torrents
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
train
for
Princeton
he
saw
no
one
he
knew
,
only
a
crowd
of
*NL*
fagged-looking
Philadelphians
.
The
presence
of
a
painted
woman
across
*NL*
the
aisle
filled
him
with
a
fresh
burst
of
sickness
and
he
changed
to
*NL*
another
car
,
tried
to
concentrate
on
an
article
in
a
popular
magazine
.
*NL*
He
found
himself
reading
the
same
paragraphs
over
and
over
,
so
he
*NL*
abandoned
this
attempt
and
leaning
over
wearily
pressed
his
hot
forehead
*NL*
against
the
damp
window-pane
.
The
car
,
a
smoker
,
was
hot
and
stuffy
with
*NL*
most
of
the
smells
of
the
state
's
alien
population
;
he
opened
a
window
*NL*
and
shivered
against
the
cloud
of
fog
that
drifted
in
over
him
.
The
two
*NL*
hours
'
ride
were
like
days
,
and
he
nearly
cried
aloud
with
joy
when
the
*NL*
towers
of
Princeton
loomed
up
beside
him
and
the
yellow
squares
of
light
*NL*
filtered
through
the
blue
rain
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
was
standing
in
the
centre
of
the
room
,
pensively
relighting
a
*NL*
cigar-stub
.
Amory
fancied
he
looked
rather
relieved
on
seeing
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Had
a
hell
of
a
dream
about
you
last
night
,
''
came
in
the
cracked
voice
*NL*
through
the
cigar
smoke
.
``
I
had
an
idea
you
were
in
some
trouble
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
tell
me
about
it
!
''
Amory
almost
shrieked
.
``
Do
n't
say
a
word
;
I
'm
*NL*
tired
and
pepped
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
looked
at
him
queerly
and
then
sank
into
a
chair
and
opened
his
*NL*
Italian
note-book
.
Amory
threw
his
coat
and
hat
on
the
floor
,
loosened
*NL*
his
collar
,
and
took
a
Wells
novel
at
random
from
the
shelf
.
``
Wells
is
*NL*
sane
,
''
he
thought
,
``
and
if
he
wo
n't
do
I
'll
read
Rupert
Brooke
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Half
an
hour
passed
.
Outside
the
wind
came
up
,
and
Amory
started
as
*NL*
the
wet
branches
moved
and
clawed
with
their
finger-nails
at
the
*NL*
window-pane
.
Tom
was
deep
in
his
work
,
and
inside
the
room
only
the
*NL*
occasional
scratch
of
a
match
or
the
rustle
of
leather
as
they
shifted
*NL*
in
their
chairs
broke
the
stillness
.
Then
like
a
zigzag
of
lightning
*NL*
came
the
change
.
Amory
sat
bolt
upright
,
frozen
cold
in
his
chair
.
Tom
*NL*
was
looking
at
him
with
his
mouth
drooping
,
eyes
fixed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
help
us
!
''
Amory
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
heavens
!
''
shouted
Tom
,
``
look
behind
!
''
Quick
as
a
flash
Amory
*NL*
whirled
around
.
He
saw
nothing
but
the
dark
window-pane
.
``
It
's
gone
*NL*
now
,
''
came
Tom
's
voice
after
a
second
in
a
still
terror
.
``
Something
was
*NL*
looking
at
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Trembling
violently
,
Amory
dropped
into
his
chair
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
got
to
tell
you
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
've
had
one
hell
of
an
experience
.
*NL*
I
think
I
've
--
I
've
seen
the
devil
or
--
something
like
him
.
What
face
did
*NL*
you
just
see
?
--
or
no
,
''
he
added
quickly
,
``
do
n't
tell
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
gave
Tom
the
story
.
It
was
midnight
when
he
finished
,
and
after
*NL*
that
,
with
all
lights
burning
,
two
sleepy
,
shivering
boys
read
to
each
*NL*
other
from
``
The
New
Machiavelli
,
''
until
dawn
came
up
out
of
Witherspoon
*NL*
Hall
,
and
the
Princetonian
fell
against
the
door
,
and
the
May
birds
*NL*
hailed
the
sun
on
last
night
's
rain

CHAPTER
4
.
Narcissus
Off
Duty
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
During
Princeton
's
transition
period
,
that
is
,
during
Amory
's
last
*NL*
two
years
there
,
while
he
saw
it
change
and
broaden
and
live
up
to
its
*NL*
Gothic
beauty
by
better
means
than
night
parades
,
certain
individuals
*NL*
arrived
who
stirred
it
to
its
plethoric
depths
.
Some
of
them
had
been
*NL*
freshmen
,
and
wild
freshmen
,
with
Amory
;
some
were
in
the
class
below
;
*NL*
and
it
was
in
the
beginning
of
his
last
year
and
around
small
tables
at
*NL*
the
Nassau
Inn
that
they
began
questioning
aloud
the
institutions
that
*NL*
Amory
and
countless
others
before
him
had
questioned
so
long
in
secret
.
*NL*
First
,
and
partly
by
accident
,
they
struck
on
certain
books
,
a
definite
*NL*
type
of
biographical
novel
that
Amory
christened
``
quest
''
books
.
In
the
*NL*
``
quest
''
book
the
hero
set
off
in
life
armed
with
the
best
weapons
and
*NL*
avowedly
intending
to
use
them
as
such
weapons
are
usually
used
,
to
push
*NL*
their
possessors
ahead
as
selfishly
and
blindly
as
possible
,
but
the
*NL*
heroes
of
the
``
quest
''
books
discovered
that
there
might
be
a
more
*NL*
magnificent
use
for
them
.
``
None
Other
Gods
,
''
``
Sinister
Street
,
''
and
``
The
*NL*
Research
Magnificent
''
were
examples
of
such
books
;
it
was
the
latter
*NL*
of
these
three
that
gripped
Burne
Holiday
and
made
him
wonder
in
the
*NL*
beginning
of
senior
year
how
much
it
was
worth
while
being
a
diplomatic
*NL*
autocrat
around
his
club
on
Prospect
Avenue
and
basking
in
the
high
*NL*
lights
of
class
office
.
It
was
distinctly
through
the
channels
of
*NL*
aristocracy
that
Burne
found
his
way
.
Amory
,
through
Kerry
,
had
had
a
*NL*
vague
drifting
acquaintance
with
him
,
but
not
until
January
of
senior
*NL*
year
did
their
friendship
commence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Heard
the
latest
?
''
said
Tom
,
coming
in
late
one
drizzly
evening
with
*NL*
that
triumphant
air
he
always
wore
after
a
successful
conversational
*NL*
bout
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
Somebody
flunked
out
?
Or
another
ship
sunk
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Worse
than
that
.
About
one-third
of
the
junior
class
are
going
to
*NL*
resign
from
their
clubs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``

``
Why

``

that

Burne
Holiday
is
behind
it

The
club

presidents
are
holding
a
meeting
to-night
to
see
if
they
can
find
a
*NL*
joint
means
of
combating
it

''
*NL*
*NL*
``

``
Well
,
''
began
Tom
,
``
it
seems
that
the
idea
developed
simultaneously
in
*NL*
several
heads

I
was
talking
to
Burne
awhile
ago
,
and
he
claims
that
*NL*
it
's
a
logical
result
if
an
intelligent
person
thinks
long
enough
*NL*
about
the
social
system
.
They
had
a
`
discussion
crowd

and
the
point
of
*NL*
abolishing
the
clubs
was
brought
up
by
some
one
--
everybody
there
leaped
*NL*
at
it
--
it
had
been
in
each
one
's
mind

more
or
less

it
just
needed
*NL*
a
spark
to
bring
it
out
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Fine
!
I
swear
I
think
it
'll
be
most
entertaining

How
do
they
feel
up

at

Gown
?

*NL*
*NL*
``

of

Every
one

getting
mad

getting
sentimental

getting
brutal

It
's
the

at

all
the

I
've
been
the
rounds

They
get
one

*NL*
*NL*
``

stand
up

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

well

's
a
damn
good
talker
,
and
so
obviously
*NL*
sincere
that
you
ca
n't
get
anywhere
with
him

It
's
so
evident
that
*NL*
resigning
from
his
club
means
so
much
more
to
him
than
preventing
it
*NL*
does
to
us
that
I
felt
futile
when
I
argued
;
finally
took
a
position
*NL*
that
was
brilliantly
neutral

I

Burne
thought
for

came
in

you

stay

*NL*

I

''
Amory
sat
down
again
,
and
as
Burne
perched
on
a
table
*NL*
and
launched
into
argument
with
Tom
,
he
looked
at
this
revolutionary
*NL*
more
carefully
than
he
ever
had
before
.
Broad-browed
and
strong-chinned
,
*NL*
with
a
fineness
in
the
honest
gray
eyes
that
were
like
Kerry
's
,
*NL*
Burne
was
a
man
who
gave
an
immediate
impression
of
bigness
and
*NL*
security
--
stubborn
,
that
was
evident
,
but
his
stubbornness
wore
no
*NL*
stolidity
,
and
when
he
had
talked
for
five
minutes
Amory
knew
that
this
*NL*
keen
enthusiasm
had
in
it
no
quality
of
dilettantism
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
intense
power
Amory
felt
later
in
Burne
Holiday
differed
from
the
*NL*
admiration
he
had
had
for
Humbird
.
This
time
it
began
as
purely
a
*NL*
mental
interest
.
With
other
men
of
whom
he
had
thought
as
primarily
*NL*
first-class
,
he
had
been
attracted
first
by
their
personalities
,
and
*NL*
in
Burne
he
missed
that
immediate
magnetism
to
which
he
usually
*NL*
swore
allegiance
.
But
that
night
Amory
was
struck
by
Burne
's
intense
*NL*
earnestness
,
a
quality
he
was
accustomed
to
associate
only
with
the
*NL*
dread
stupidity
,
and
by
the
great
enthusiasm
that
struck
dead
chords
in
*NL*
his
heart
.
Burne
stood
vaguely
for
a
land
Amory
hoped
he
was
drifting
*NL*
toward
--
and
it
was
almost
time
that
land
was
in
sight
.
Tom
and
Amory
and
*NL*
Alec
had
reached
an
impasse
;
never
did
they
seem
to
have
new
experiences
*NL*
in
common
,
for
Tom
and
Alec
had
been
as
blindly
busy
with
their
*NL*
committees
and
boards
as
Amory
had
been
blindly
idling
,
and
the
things
*NL*
they
had
for
dissection
--
college
,
contemporary
personality
and
the
*NL*
like
--
they
had
hashed
and
rehashed
for
many
a
frugal
conversational
*NL*
meal
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
night
they
discussed
the
clubs
until
twelve
,
and
,
in
the
main
,
they
*NL*
agreed
with
Burne
.
To
the
roommates
it
did
not
seem
such
a
vital
subject
*NL*
as
it
had
in
the
two
years
before
,
but
the
logic
of
Burne
's
objections
*NL*
to
the
social
system
dovetailed
so
completely
with
everything
they
had
*NL*
thought
,
that
they
questioned
rather
than
argued
,
and
envied
the
sanity
*NL*
that
enabled
this
man
to
stand
out
so
against
all
traditions
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Amory
branched
off
and
found
that
Burne
was
deep
in
other
things
*NL*
as
well
.
Economics
had
interested
him
and
he
was
turning
socialist
.
*NL*
Pacifism
played
in
the
back
of
his
mind
,
and
he
read
The
Masses
and
*NL*
Lyoff
Tolstoi
faithfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
about
religion
?
''
Amory
asked
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
know
.
I
'm
in
a
muddle
about
a
lot
of
things
--
I
've
just
discovered
*NL*
that
I
've
a
mind
,
and
I
'm
starting
to
read

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Read
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Everything
.
I
have
to
pick
and
choose
,
of
course
,
but
mostly
things
to
*NL*
make
me
think

I
'm
reading
the
four
gospels
now
,
and
the
`
Varieties
of
*NL*
Religious
Experience
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
chiefly
started
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wells
,
I
guess
,
and
Tolstoi
,
and
a
man
named
Edward
Carpenter
.
I
've
*NL*
been
reading
for
over
a
year
now
--
on
a
few
lines
,
on
what
I
consider
the
*NL*
essential
lines

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poetry

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
frankly
,
not
what
you
call
poetry
,
or
for
your
reasons
--
you
two
*NL*
write

course
,
and
look
at
things
differently
.
Whitman
is
the
man
*NL*
that
attracts
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whitman
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
he
's
a
definite
ethical
force
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
'm
ashamed
to
say
that
I
'm
a
blank
on
the
subject
of
Whitman
.
*NL*
How
about
you
,
Tom
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
nodded
sheepishly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
continued
Burne
,
``
you
may
strike
a
few
poems
that
are
tiresome
,
*NL*
but
I
mean
the
mass
of
his
work
.
He
's
tremendous
--
like
Tolstoi
.
They
*NL*
both
look
things
in
the
face
,
and
,
somehow
,
different
as
they
are
,
stand
*NL*
for
somewhat
the
same
things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
me
stumped
,
Burne
,
''
Amory
admitted
.
``
I
've
read
`
Anna
Karenina
'
*NL*
and
the
`
Kreutzer
Sonata
'
of
course
,
but
Tolstoi
is
mostly
in
the
*NL*
original
Russian
as
far
as
I
'm
concerned
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
the
greatest
man
in
hundreds
of
years
,
''
cried
Burne
*NL*
enthusiastically
.
``
Did
you
ever
see
a
picture
of
that
shaggy
old
head
of
*NL*
his
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
talked
until
three
,
from
biology
to
organized
religion
,
and
when
*NL*
Amory
crept
shivering
into
bed
it
was
with
his
mind
aglow
with
ideas
*NL*
and
a
sense
of
shock
that
some
one
else
had
discovered
the
path
he
might
*NL*
have
followed
.
Burne
Holiday
was
so
evidently
developing
--
and
Amory
*NL*
had
considered
that
he
was
doing
the
same
.
He
had
fallen
into
a
deep
*NL*
cynicism
over
what
had
crossed
his
path
,
plotted
the
imperfectability
of
*NL*
man
and
read
Shaw
and
Chesterton
enough
to
keep
his
mind
from
the
edges
*NL*
of
decadence
--
now
suddenly
all
his
mental
processes
of
the
last
year
and
*NL*
a
half
seemed
stale
and
futile
--
a
petty
consummation
of
himself
...
and
*NL*
like
a
sombre
background
lay
that
incident
of
the
spring
before
,
that
*NL*
filled
half
his
nights
with
a
dreary
terror
and
made
him
unable
to
pray
.
*NL*
He
was
not
even
a
Catholic
,
yet
that
was
the
only
ghost
of
a
code
that
*NL*
he
had
,
the
gaudy
,
ritualistic
,
paradoxical
Catholicism
whose
prophet
*NL*
was
Chesterton
,
whose
claqueurs
were
such
reformed
rakes
of
literature
*NL*
as
Huysmans
and
Bourget
,
whose
American
sponsor
was
Ralph
Adams
Cram
,
*NL*
with
his
adulation
of
thirteenth-century
cathedrals
--
a
Catholicism
which
*NL*
Amory
found
convenient
and
ready-made
,
without
priest
or
sacraments
or
*NL*
sacrifice
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
not
sleep
,
so
he
turned
on
his
reading-lamp
and
,
taking
down
*NL*
the
``
Kreutzer
Sonata
,
''
searched
it
carefully
for
the
germs
of
Burne
's
*NL*
enthusiasm
.
Being
Burne
was
suddenly
so
much
realler
than
being
clever
.
*NL*
Yet
he
sighed
...
here
were
other
possible
clay
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
thought
back
through
two
years
,
of
Burne
as
a
hurried
,
nervous
*NL*
freshman
,
quite
submerged
in
his
brother
's
personality
.
Then
he
*NL*
remembered
an
incident
of
sophomore
year
,
in
which
Burne
had
been
*NL*
suspected
of
the
leading
role
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dean
Hollister
had
been
heard
by
a
large
group
arguing
with
a
*NL*
taxi-driver
,
who
had
driven
him
from
the
junction
.
In
the
course
of
the
*NL*
altercation
the
dean
remarked
that
he
``
might
as
well
buy
the
taxicab
.
''
*NL*
He
paid
and
walked
off
,
but
next
morning
he
entered
his
private
office
*NL*
to
find
the
taxicab
itself
in
the
space
usually
occupied
by
his
desk
,
*NL*
bearing
a
sign
which
read
``
Property
of
Dean
Hollister
.
Bought
and
Paid
*NL*
for
.
''
...
It
took
two
expert
mechanics
half
a
day
to
dissemble
it
into
*NL*
its
minutest
parts
and
remove
it
,
which
only
goes
to
prove
the
rare
*NL*
energy
of
sophomore
humor
under
efficient
leadership
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
again
,
that
very
fall
,
Burne
had
caused
a
sensation
.
A
certain
*NL*
Phyllis
Styles
,
an
intercollegiate
prom-trotter
,
had
failed
to
get
her
*NL*
yearly
invitation
to
the
Harvard-Princeton
game
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jesse
Ferrenby
had
brought
her
to
a
smaller
game
a
few
weeks
before
,
*NL*
and
had
pressed
Burne
into
service
--
to
the
ruination
of
the
latter
's
*NL*
misogyny
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
coming
to
the
Harvard
game
?
''
Burne
had
asked
indiscreetly
,
*NL*
merely
to
make
conversation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
ask
me
,
''
cried
Phyllis
quickly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
I
do
,
''
said
Burne
feebly
.
He
was
unversed
in
the
arts
of
*NL*
Phyllis
,
and
was
sure
that
this
was
merely
a
vapid
form
of
kidding
.
*NL*
Before
an
hour
had
passed
he
knew
that
he
was
indeed
involved
.
Phyllis
*NL*
had
pinned
him
down
and
served
him
up
,
informed
him
the
train
she
was
*NL*
arriving
by
,
and
depressed
him
thoroughly
.
Aside
from
loathing
Phyllis
,
*NL*
he
had
particularly
wanted
to
stag
that
game
and
entertain
some
Harvard
*NL*
friends
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
'll
see
,
''
he
informed
a
delegation
who
arrived
in
his
room
to
josh
*NL*
him
.
``
This
will
be
the
last
game
she
ever
persuades
any
young
innocent
*NL*
to
take
her
to
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
Burne
--
why
did
you
_
invite
_
her
if
you
did
n't
want
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Burne
,
you
_
know
_
you
're
secretly
mad
about
her
--
that
's
the
_
real
_
*NL*
trouble
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
can
_
you
_
do
,
Burne
?
What
can
_
you
_
do
against
Phyllis
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Burne
only
shook
his
head
and
muttered
threats
which
consisted
*NL*
largely
of
the
phrase
:
``
She
'll
see
,
she
'll
see
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
blithesome
Phyllis
bore
her
twenty-five
summers
gayly
from
the
*NL*
train
,
but
on
the
platform
a
ghastly
sight
met
her
eyes
.
There
were
*NL*
Burne
and
Fred
Sloane
arrayed
to
the
last
dot
like
the
lurid
figures
*NL*
on
college
posters
.
They
had
bought
flaring
suits
with
huge
peg-top
*NL*
trousers
and
gigantic
padded
shoulders
.
On
their
heads
were
rakish
*NL*
college
hats
,
pinned
up
in
front
and
sporting
bright
orange-and-black
*NL*
bands
,
while
from
their
celluloid
collars
blossomed
flaming
orange
ties
.
*NL*
They
wore
black
arm-bands
with
orange
``
P
's
,
''
and
carried
canes
*NL*
flying
Princeton
pennants
,
the
effect
completed
by
socks
and
peeping
*NL*
handkerchiefs
in
the
same
color
motifs
.
On
a
clanking
chain
they
led
a
*NL*
large
,
angry
tom-cat
,
painted
to
represent
a
tiger
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
good
half
of
the
station
crowd
was
already
staring
at
them
,
torn
*NL*
between
horrified
pity
and
riotous
mirth
,
and
as
Phyllis
,
with
her
*NL*
svelte
jaw
dropping
,
approached
,
the
pair
bent
over
and
emitted
a
*NL*
college
cheer
in
loud
,
far-carrying
voices
,
thoughtfully
adding
the
*NL*
name
``
Phyllis
''
to
the
end
.
She
was
vociferously
greeted
and
escorted
*NL*
enthusiastically
across
the
campus
,
followed
by
half
a
hundred
village
*NL*
urchins
--
to
the
stifled
laughter
of
hundreds
of
alumni
and
visitors
,
*NL*
half
of
whom
had
no
idea
that
this
was
a
practical
joke
,
but
thought
*NL*
that
Burne
and
Fred
were
two
varsity
sports
showing
their
girl
a
*NL*
collegiate
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
Phyllis
's
feelings
as
she
was
paraded
by
the
Harvard
and
Princeton
*NL*
stands
,
where
sat
dozens
of
her
former
devotees
,
can
be
imagined
.
She
*NL*
tried
to
walk
a
little
ahead
,
she
tried
to
walk
a
little
behind
--
but
*NL*
they
stayed
close
,
that
there
should
be
no
doubt
whom
she
was
with
,
*NL*
talking
in
loud
voices
of
their
friends
on
the
football
team
,
until
she
*NL*
could
almost
hear
her
acquaintances
whispering
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Phyllis
Styles
must
be
_
awfully
hard
up
_
to
have
to
come
with
_
those
*NL*
two
_
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
had
been
Burne
,
dynamically
humorous
,
fundamentally
serious
.
From
*NL*
that
root
had
blossomed
the
energy
that
he
was
now
trying
to
orient
with
*NL*
progress
...
*NL*
*NL*
So
the
weeks
passed
and
March
came
and
the
clay
feet
that
Amory
looked
*NL*
for
failed
to
appear
.
About
a
hundred
juniors
and
seniors
resigned
*NL*
from
their
clubs
in
a
final
fury
of
righteousness
,
and
the
clubs
in
*NL*
helplessness
turned
upon
Burne
their
finest
weapon
:
ridicule
.
Every
one
*NL*
who
knew
him
liked
him
--
but
what
he
stood
for
-LRB-
and
he
began
to
stand
for
*NL*
more
all
the
time
-RRB-
came
under
the
lash
of
many
tongues
,
until
a
frailer
*NL*
man
than
he
would
have
been
snowed
under
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
mind
losing
prestige
?
''
asked
Amory
one
night
.
They
had
taken
*NL*
to
exchanging
calls
several
times
a
week
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
I
do
n't
.
What
's
prestige
,
at
best
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Some
people
say
that
you
're
just
a
rather
original
politician
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
roared
with
laughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
what
Fred
Sloane
told
me
to-day
.
I
suppose
I
have
it
coming
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
One
afternoon
they
dipped
into
a
subject
that
had
interested
Amory
for
*NL*
a
long
time
--
the
matter
of
the
bearing
of
physical
attributes
on
a
man
's
*NL*
make-up
.
Burne
had
gone
into
the
biology
of
this
,
and
then
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
health
counts
--
a
healthy
man
has
twice
the
chance
of
being
*NL*
good
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
agree
with
you
--
I
do
n't
believe
in
`
muscular
Christianity
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
--
I
believe
Christ
had
great
physical
vigor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
''
Amory
protested
.
``
He
worked
too
hard
for
that
.
I
imagine
that
*NL*
when
he
died
he
was
a
broken-down
man
--
and
the
great
saints
have
n't
been
*NL*
strong
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Half
of
them
have
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
even
granting
that
,
I
do
n't
think
health
has
anything
to
do
with

goodness
;
of
course
,
it
's
valuable
to
a
great
saint
to
be
able
to
stand
*NL*
enormous
strains
,
but
this
fad
of
popular
preachers
rising
on
their
*NL*
toes
in
simulated
virility
,
bellowing
that
calisthenics
will
save
the
*NL*
world

no

Burne
,
I
ca
n't
go
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
let
's
waive
it
--
we
wo
n't
get
anywhere
,
and
besides
I
have
n't
*NL*
quite
made
up
my
mind
about
it
myself
.
Now
,
here
's
something
I
_
do

*NL*
know
--
personal
appearance
has
a
lot
to
do
with
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Coloring
?
''
Amory
asked
eagerly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
what
Tom
and
I
figured
,
''
Amory
agreed
.
``
We
took
the
year-books
*NL*
for
the
last
ten
years
and
looked
at
the
pictures
of
the
senior
council
.
*NL*
I
know
you
do
n't
think
much
of
that
august
body
,
but
it
does
represent
*NL*
success
here
in
a
general
way
.
Well
,
I
suppose
only
about
thirty-five
*NL*
per
cent
of
every
class
here
are
blonds
,
are
really
light
--
yet
*NL*
_
two-thirds
_
of
every
senior
council
are
light
.
We
looked
at
pictures
*NL*
of
ten
years
of
them
,
mind
you
;
that
means
that
out
of
every
_
fifteen
_
*NL*
light-haired
men
in
the
senior
class
_
one
_
is
on
the
senior
council
,
and
*NL*
of
the
dark-haired
men
it
's
only
one
in
_
fifty
_
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
true
,
''
Burne
agreed
.
``
The
light-haired
man
_
is
_
a
higher
type
,
*NL*
generally
speaking
.
I
worked
the
thing
out
with
the
Presidents
of
*NL*
the
United
States
once
,
and
found
that
way
over
half
of
them
were
*NL*
light-haired
--
yet
think
of
the
preponderant
number
of
brunettes
in
the
*NL*
race
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
People
unconsciously
admit
it
,
''
said
Amory
.
``
You
'll
notice
a
blond
*NL*
person
is
_
expected
_
to
talk
.
If
a
blond
girl
does
n't
talk
we
call
her
a
*NL*
`
doll
'
;
if
a
light-haired
man
is
silent
he
's
considered
stupid
.
Yet
*NL*
the
world
is
full
of
`
dark
silent
men
'
and
`
languorous
brunettes
'
who
*NL*
have
n't
a
brain
in
their
heads
,
but
somehow
are
never
accused
of
the
*NL*
dearth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
the
large
mouth
and
broad
chin
and
rather
big
nose
undoubtedly
make
*NL*
the
superior
face
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
so
sure
.
''
Amory
was
all
for
classical
features
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
--
I
'll
show
you
,
''
and
Burne
pulled
out
of
his
desk
a
*NL*
photographic
collection
of
heavily
bearded
,
shaggy
celebrities
--
Tolstoi
,
*NL*
Whitman
,
Carpenter
,
and
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
n't
they
wonderful
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
tried
politely
to
appreciate
them
,
and
gave
up
laughingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Burne
,
I
think
they
're
the
ugliest-looking
crowd
I
ever
came
across
.
*NL*
They
look
like
an
old
man
's
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Amory
,
look
at
that
forehead
on
Emerson
;
look
at
Tolstoi
's
eyes
.
''
*NL*
His
tone
was
reproachful
.
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
shook
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
!
Call
them
remarkable-looking
or
anything
you
want
--
but
ugly
they
*NL*
certainly
are
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Unabashed
,
Burne
ran
his
hand
lovingly
across
the
spacious
foreheads
,
*NL*
and
piling
up
the
pictures
put
them
back
in
his
desk
.
*NL*
*NL*
Walking
at
night
was
one
of
his
favorite
pursuits
,
and
one
night
he
*NL*
persuaded
Amory
to
accompany
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hate
the
dark
,
''
Amory
objected
.
``
I
did
n't
use
to
--
except
when
I
was
*NL*
particularly
imaginative
,
but
now
,
I
really
do
--
I
'm
a
regular
fool
about
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
useless
,
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
possibly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
'll
go
east
,
''
Burne
suggested
,
``
and
down
that
string
of
roads
through
*NL*
the
woods
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
n't
sound
very
appealing
to
me
,
''
admitted
Amory
reluctantly
,
``
but
*NL*
let
's
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
set
off
at
a
good
gait
,
and
for
an
hour
swung
along
in
a
brisk
*NL*
argument
until
the
lights
of
Princeton
were
luminous
white
blots
behind
*NL*
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Any
person
with
any
imagination
is
bound
to
be
afraid
,
''
said
Burne
*NL*
earnestly
.
``
And
this
very
walking
at
night
is
one
of
the
things
I
was
*NL*
afraid
about
.
I
'm
going
to
tell
you
why
I
can
walk
anywhere
now
and
not
*NL*
be
afraid
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
on
,
''
Amory
urged
eagerly
.
They
were
striding
toward
the
woods
,
*NL*
Burne
's
nervous
,
enthusiastic
voice
warming
to
his
subject
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
used
to
come
out
here
alone
at
night
,
oh
,
three
months
ago
,
and
I
*NL*
always
stopped
at
that
cross-road
we
just
passed
.
There
were
the
woods
*NL*
looming
up
ahead
,
just
as
they
do
now
,
there
were
dogs
howling
and
*NL*
the
shadows
and
no
human
sound
.
Of
course
,
I
peopled
the
woods
with
*NL*
everything
ghastly
,
just
like
you
do
;
do
n't
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
,
''
Amory
admitted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
began
analyzing
it
--
my
imagination
persisted
in
sticking
*NL*
horrors
into
the
dark
--
so
I
stuck
my
imagination
into
the
dark
instead
,
*NL*
and
let
it
look
out
at
me
--
I
let
it
play
stray
dog
or
escaped
convict
*NL*
or
ghost
,
and
then
saw
myself
coming
along
the
road
.
That
made
it
all
*NL*
right
--
as
it
always
makes
everything
all
right
to
project
yourself
*NL*
completely
into
another
's
place
.
I
knew
that
if
I
were
the
dog
or
the
*NL*
convict
or
the
ghost
I
would
n't
be
a
menace
to
Burne
Holiday
any
more
*NL*
than
he
was
a
menace
to
me
.
Then
I
thought
of
my
watch
.
I
'd
better
go
*NL*
back
and
leave
it
and
then
essay
the
woods
.
No
;
I
decided
,
it
's
*NL*
better
on
the
whole
that
I
should
lose
a
watch
than
that
I
should
turn
*NL*
back
--
and
I
did
go
into
them
--
not
only
followed
the
road
through
them
,
*NL*
but
walked
into
them
until
I
was
n't
frightened
any
more
--
did
it
until
*NL*
one
night
I
sat
down
and
dozed
off
in
there
;
then
I
knew
I
was
through
*NL*
being
afraid
of
the
dark
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lordy
,
''
Amory
breathed
.
``
I
could
n't
have
done
that
.
I
'd
have
come
out
*NL*
half-way
,
and
the
first
time
an
automobile
passed
and
made
the
dark
*NL*
thicker
when
its
lamps
disappeared
,
I
'd
have
come
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
Burne
said
suddenly
,
after
a
few
moments
'
silence
,
``
we
're
*NL*
half-way
through
,
let
's
turn
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
return
he
launched
into
a
discussion
of
will
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
the
whole
thing
,
''
he
asserted
.
``
It
's
the
one
dividing
line
between
*NL*
good
and
evil
.
I
've
never
met
a
man
who
led
a
rotten
life
and
did
n't
*NL*
have
a
weak
will
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
about
great
criminals
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
're
usually
insane
.
If
not
,
they
're
weak
.
There
is
no
such
thing
as
*NL*
a
strong
,
sane
criminal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Burne
,
I
disagree
with
you
altogether
;
how
about
the
superman
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
evil
,
I
think
,
yet
he
's
strong
and
sane
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
never
met
him
.
I
'll
bet
,
though
,
that
he
's
stupid
or
insane
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
met
him
over
and
over
and
he
's
neither
.
That
's
why
I
think
you
're
*NL*
wrong
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sure
I
'm
not
--
and
so
I
do
n't
believe
in
imprisonment
except
for
the
*NL*
insane
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
this
point
Amory
could
not
agree
.
It
seemed
to
him
that
life
*NL*
and
history
were
rife
with
the
strong
criminal
,
keen
,
but
often
*NL*
self-deluding
;
in
politics
and
business
one
found
him
and
among
the
*NL*
old
statesmen
and
kings
and
generals
;
but
Burne
never
agreed
and
their
*NL*
courses
began
to
split
on
that
point
.
*NL*
*NL*
Burne
was
drawing
farther
and
farther
away
from
the
world
about
him
.
He
*NL*
resigned
the
vice-presidency
of
the
senior
class
and
took
to
reading
and
*NL*
walking
as
almost
his
only
pursuits
.
He
voluntarily
attended
graduate
*NL*
lectures
in
philosophy
and
biology
,
and
sat
in
all
of
them
with
a
rather
*NL*
pathetically
intent
look
in
his
eyes
,
as
if
waiting
for
something
the
*NL*
lecturer
would
never
quite
come
to
.
Sometimes
Amory
would
see
him
squirm
*NL*
in
his
seat
;
and
his
face
would
light
up
;
he
was
on
fire
to
debate
a
*NL*
point
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
grew
more
abstracted
on
the
street
and
was
even
accused
of
becoming
*NL*
a
snob
,
but
Amory
knew
it
was
nothing
of
the
sort
,
and
once
when
Burne
*NL*
passed
him
four
feet
off
,
absolutely
unseeingly
,
his
mind
a
thousand
*NL*
miles
away
,
Amory
almost
choked
with
the
romantic
joy
of
watching
him
.
*NL*
Burne
seemed
to
be
climbing
heights
where
others
would
be
forever
unable
*NL*
to
get
a
foothold
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
tell
you
,
''
Amory
declared
to
Tom
,
``
he
's
the
first
contemporary
I
've
*NL*
ever
met
whom
I
'll
admit
is
my
superior
in
mental
capacity
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
bad
time
to
admit
it
--
people
are
beginning
to
think
he
's
odd
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
way
over
their
heads
--
you
know
you
think
so
yourself
when
you
*NL*
talk
to
him
--
Good
Lord
,
Tom
,
you
_
used
_
to
stand
out
against
`
people
.
'
*NL*
Success
has
completely
conventionalized
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
grew
rather
annoyed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
he
trying
to
do
--
be
excessively
holy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
!
not
like
anybody
you
've
ever
seen
.
Never
enters
the
Philadelphian
*NL*
Society
.
He
has
no
faith
in
that
rot
.
He
does
n't
believe
that
public
*NL*
swimming-pools
and
a
kind
word
in
time
will
right
the
wrongs
of
the
*NL*
world
;
moreover
,
he
takes
a
drink
whenever
he
feels
like
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
certainly
is
getting
in
wrong
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
talked
to
him
lately
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
have
n't
any
conception
of
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
argument
ended
nowhere
,
but
Amory
noticed
more
than
ever
how
the
*NL*
sentiment
toward
Burne
had
changed
on
the
campus
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
odd
,
''
Amory
said
to
Tom
one
night
when
they
had
grown
more
*NL*
amicable
on
the
subject
,
``
that
the
people
who
violently
disapprove
of
*NL*
Burne
's
radicalism
are
distinctly
the
Pharisee
class
--
I
mean
they
're
the
*NL*
best-educated
men
in
college
--
the
editors
of
the
papers
,
like
yourself
*NL*
and
Ferrenby
,
the
younger
professors
...
The
illiterate
athletes
like
*NL*
Langueduc
think
he
's
getting
eccentric
,
but
they
just
say
,
`
Good
old
*NL*
Burne
has
got
some
queer
ideas
in
his
head
,
'
and
pass
on
--
the
Pharisee
*NL*
class
--
Gee
!
they
ridicule
him
unmercifully
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
morning
he
met
Burne
hurrying
along
McCosh
walk
after
a
*NL*
recitation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whither
bound
,
Tsar
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Over
to
the
Prince
office
to
see
Ferrenby
,
''
he
waved
a
copy
of
the
*NL*
morning
's
Princetonian
at
Amory
.
``
He
wrote
this
editorial
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Going
to
flay
him
alive
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

but
he
's
got
me
all
balled
up

Either
I
've
misjudged
him

he
's
*NL*
suddenly
become
the
world
's
worst
radical

''
*NL*
*NL*
Burne
hurried
on
,
and
it
was
several
days
before
Amory
heard
an
account
*NL*
of
the
ensuing
conversation
.
Burne
had
come
into
the
editor
's
sanctum
*NL*
displaying
the
paper
cheerfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

AMORY
WRITES
A
POEM
*NL*
*NL*
The
weeks
tore
by
.
Amory
wandered
occasionally
to
New
York
on
the
chance
*NL*
of
finding
a
new
shining
green
auto-bus
,
that
its
stick-of-candy
*NL*
glamour
might
penetrate
his
disposition
.
One
day
he
ventured
into
a
*NL*
stock-company
revival
of
a
play
whose
name
was
faintly
familiar
.
The
*NL*
curtain
rose
--
he
watched
casually
as
a
girl
entered
.
A
few
phrases
rang
*NL*
in
his
ear
and
touched
a
faint
chord
of
memory
.
Where
--
?
When
--
?
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
seemed
to
hear
a
voice
whispering
beside
him
,
a
very
soft
,
*NL*
vibrant
voice
:
``
Oh
,
I
'm
such
a
poor
little
fool
;
_
do
_
tell
me
when
I
do
*NL*
wrong
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
solution
came
in
a
flash
and
he
had
a
quick
,
glad
memory
of
*NL*
Isabelle
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
found
a
blank
space
on
his
programme
,
and
began
to
scribble
rapidly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
in
the
figured
dark
I
watch
once
more
,
*NL*
There
,
with
the
curtain
,
roll
the
years
away
;
*NL*
Two
years
of
years
--
there
was
an
idle
day
*NL*
Of
ours
,
when
happy
endings
did
n't
bore
*NL*
Our
unfermented
souls
;
I
could
adore
*NL*
Your
eager
face
beside
me
,
wide-eyed
,
gay
,
*NL*
Smiling
a
repertoire
while
the
poor
play
*NL*
Reached
me
as
a
faint
ripple
reaches
shore
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yawning
and
wondering
an
evening
through
,
*NL*
I
watch
alone
...
and
chatterings
,
of
course
,
*NL*
Spoil
the
one
scene
which
,
somehow
,
_
did
_
have
charms
;
*NL*
You
wept
a
bit
,
and
I
grew
sad
for
you

Right

``
Ghosts

Alec

they
're

always
outguess
a
ghost

''
*NL*
*NL*
``

''
asked
Tom
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

it

demanded
Amory
,
*NL*
interested
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
a
stick

answered
Alec
,
with
ponderous
reverence
,
``
one
about
the
*NL*
length
of
a
broom-handle

Now
,
the
first
thing
to
do
is
to
get
the
room
*NL*
_
cleared
_
--
to
do
this
you
rush
with
your
eyes
closed
into
your
study

and
turn
on
the
lights

next
,
approaching
the
closet
,
carefully
run
the
*NL*
stick
in
the
door
three

four
times

Then
,
if
nothing
happens

you
can
*NL*
look
in

Always

always

run
the
stick
in
viciously
first
--
_
never
_
look
*NL*
first
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
,
that
's
the
ancient
Celtic
school
,
''
said
Tom
gravely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
but
they
usually
pray
first
.
Anyway
,
you
use
this
method
to
clear
*NL*
the
closets

also
for
behind
all
doors

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
the

Amory
suggested
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

Amory

no

cried
Alec
in
horror
.
``
That
is
n't
the
way

the
bed
*NL*
requires
different
tactics

let
the
bed
alone

as
you
value
your
*NL*
reason

if
there
is
a
ghost
in
the
room
and
that
's
only
about
a
third
of

the
time

it
is
_
almost
always

under
the

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

Amory
began
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alec
waved
him
into
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of

you
never

in

before

what

going

do
make
a
sudden
leap
for
the

bed

never
walk
near

to
a

your
ankle
is
your
most

vulnerable
part

once
in

lie
around

*NL*
Amory
was
enjoying
college
immensely
again
.
The
sense
of
going
forward
*NL*
in
a
direct
,
determined
line
had
come
back
;
youth
was
stirring
and
*NL*
shaking
out
a
few
new
feathers
.
He
had
even
stored
enough
surplus
energy
*NL*
to
sally
into
a
new
pose
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
idea
of
all
this
`
distracted
'
stuff
,
Amory
?
''
asked
Alec
one
*NL*
day
,
and
then
as
Amory
pretended
to
be
cramped
over
his
book
in
a
daze
:
*NL*
``
Oh
,
do
n't
try
to
act
Burne
,
the
mystic
,
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
looked
up
innocently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
mimicked
Alec
.
``
Are
you
trying
to
read
yourself
into
a
rhapsody
*NL*
with
--
let
's
see
the
book

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
snatched
it
;
regarded
it
derisively
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
said
Amory
a
little
stiffly
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
The

read
Alec
aloud
.
``
Oh

*NL*
*NL*
``
Say

Alec

''
*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
Does

*NL*
*NL*
``

``

``
Why

no

n't
_
bother

me

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
do
n't
spoil
it
.
If
I
enjoy
going
around
telling
people
*NL*
guilelessly
that
I
think
I
'm
a
genius
,
let
me
do
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
getting
a
reputation
for
being
eccentric

said
Alec
,
laughing
,
*NL*
``
if
that
's
what
you
mean
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
finally
prevailed
,
and
Alec
agreed
to
accept
his
face
value
in
the
*NL*
presence
of
others
if
he
was
allowed
rest
periods
when
they
were
alone
;
*NL*
so
Amory
``
ran
it
out
''
at
a
great
rate
,
bringing
the
most
eccentric
*NL*
characters
to
dinner
,
wild-eyed
grad
students
,
preceptors
with
strange
*NL*
theories
of
God
and
government
,
to
the
cynical
amazement
of
the
*NL*
supercilious
Cottage
Club
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
February
became
slashed
by
sun
and
moved
cheerfully
into
March
,
*NL*
Amory
went
several
times
to
spend
week-ends
with
Monsignor
;
once
he
*NL*
took
Burne
,
with
great
success
,
for
he
took
equal
pride
and
delight
in
*NL*
displaying
them
to
each
other
.
Monsignor
took
him
several
times
to
see
*NL*
Thornton
Hancock
,
and
once
or
twice
to
the
house
of
a
Mrs.
Lawrence
,
a
*NL*
type
of
Rome-haunting
American
whom
Amory
liked
immediately
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
one
day
came
a
letter
from
Monsignor
,
which
appended
an
interesting
*NL*
P.
S.
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
,
''
it
ran
,
``
that
your
third
cousin
,
Clara
Page
,
*NL*
widowed
six
months
and
very
poor
,
is
living
in
Philadelphia
?
*NL*
I
do
n't
think
you
've
ever
met
her
,
but
I
wish
,
as
a
favor
to
me
,
*NL*
you
'd
go
to
see
her
.
To
my
mind
,
she
's
rather
a
remarkable
woman
,
*NL*
and
just
about
your
age
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
sighed
and
decided
to
go
,
as
a
favor
...
*NL*
*NL*
*****
*NL*
*NL*
CLARA
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
immemorial
...
Amory
was
n't
good
enough
for
Clara
,
Clara
of
*NL*
ripply
golden
hair
,
but
then
no
man
was
.
Her
goodness
was
above
the
*NL*
prosy
morals
of
the
husband-seeker
,
apart
from
the
dull
literature
of
*NL*
female
virtue
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sorrow
lay
lightly
around
her
,
and
when
Amory
found
her
in
Philadelphia
*NL*
he
thought
her
steely
blue
eyes
held
only
happiness
;
a
latent
strength
,
*NL*
a
realism
,
was
brought
to
its
fullest
development
by
the
facts
that
*NL*
she
was
compelled
to
face
.
She
was
alone
in
the
world
,
with
two
small
*NL*
children
,
little
money
,
and
,
worst
of
all
,
a
host
of
friends
.
He
saw
*NL*
her
that
winter
in
Philadelphia
entertaining
a
houseful
of
men
for
an
*NL*
evening
,
when
he
knew
she
had
not
a
servant
in
the
house
except
the
*NL*
little
colored
girl
guarding
the
babies
overhead
.
He
saw
one
of
the
*NL*
greatest
libertines
in
that
city
,
a
man
who
was
habitually
drunk
and
*NL*
notorious
at
home
and
abroad
,
sitting
opposite
her
for
an
evening
,
*NL*
discussing
_
girls
'
boarding-schools
_
with
a
sort
of
innocent
excitement
.
*NL*
What
a
twist
Clara
had
to
her
mind
!
She
could
make
fascinating
and
*NL*
almost
brilliant
conversation
out
of
the
thinnest
air
that
ever
floated
*NL*
through
a
drawing-room
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
idea
that
the
girl
was
poverty-stricken
had
appealed
to
Amory
's
*NL*
sense
of
situation
.
He
arrived
in
Philadelphia
expecting
to
be
told
*NL*
that
921
Ark
Street
was
in
a
miserable
lane
of
hovels
.
He
was
even
*NL*
disappointed
when
it
proved
to
be
nothing
of
the
sort
.
It
was
an
old
*NL*
house
that
had
been
in
her
husband
's
family
for
years
.
An
elderly
aunt
,
*NL*
who
objected
to
having
it
sold
,
had
put
ten
years
'
taxes
with
a
*NL*
lawyer
and
pranced
off
to
Honolulu
,
leaving
Clara
to
struggle
with
the
*NL*
heating-problem
as
best
she
could
.
So
no
wild-haired
woman
with
a
hungry
*NL*
baby
at
her
breast
and
a
sad
Amelia-like
look
greeted
him
.
Instead
,
*NL*
Amory
would
have
thought
from
his
reception
that
she
had
not
a
care
in
*NL*
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
calm
virility
and
a
dreamy
humor
,
marked
contrasts
to
her
*NL*
level-headedness
--
into
these
moods
she
slipped
sometimes
as
a
refuge
.
*NL*
She
could
do
the
most
prosy
things
-LRB-
though
she
was
wise
enough
never
*NL*
to
stultify
herself
with
such
``
household
arts
''
as
_
knitting
_
and
*NL*
_
embroidery
_
-RRB-
,
yet
immediately
afterward
pick
up
a
book
and
let
her
*NL*
imagination
rove
as
a
formless
cloud
with
the
wind
.
Deepest
of
all
in
*NL*
her
personality
was
the
golden
radiance
that
she
diffused
around
her
.
*NL*
As
an
open
fire
in
a
dark
room
throws
romance
and
pathos
into
the
quiet
*NL*
faces
at
its
edge
,
so
she
cast
her
lights
and
shadows
around
the
rooms
*NL*
that
held
her
,
until
she
made
of
her
prosy
old
uncle
a
man
of
quaint
and
*NL*
meditative
charm
,
metamorphosed
the
stray
telegraph
boy
into
a
Puck-like
*NL*
creature
of
delightful
originality
.
At
first
this
quality
of
hers
*NL*
somehow
irritated
Amory
.
He
considered
his
own
uniqueness
sufficient
,
*NL*
and
it
rather
embarrassed
him
when
she
tried
to
read
new
interests
into
*NL*
him
for
the
benefit
of
what
other
adorers
were
present
.
He
felt
as
if
*NL*
a
polite
but
insistent
stage-manager
were
attempting
to
make
him
give
a
*NL*
new
interpretation
of
a
part
he
had
conned
for
years
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Clara
talking
,
Clara
telling
a
slender
tale
of
a
hatpin
and
an
*NL*
inebriated
man
and
herself
...
People
tried
afterward
to
repeat
her
*NL*
anecdotes
but
for
the
life
of
them
they
could
make
them
sound
like
*NL*
nothing
whatever
.
They
gave
her
a
sort
of
innocent
attention
and
the
*NL*
best
smiles
many
of
them
had
smiled
for
long
;
there
were
few
tears
in
*NL*
Clara
,
but
people
smiled
misty-eyed
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Very
occasionally
Amory
stayed
for
little
half-hours
after
the
rest
of
*NL*
the
court
had
gone
,
and
they
would
have
bread
and
jam
and
tea
late
in
*NL*
the
afternoon
or
``
maple-sugar
lunches
,
''
as
she
called
them
,
at
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
_
are
_
remarkable
,
are
n't
you
!
''
Amory
was
becoming
trite
from
where
*NL*
he
perched
in
the
centre
of
the
dining-room
table
one
six
o'clock
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
a
bit
,
''
she
answered
.
She
was
searching
out
napkins
in
the
*NL*
sideboard
.
``
I
'm
really
most
humdrum
and
commonplace
.
One
of
those
people
*NL*
who
have
no
interest
in
anything
but
their
children
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
that
to
somebody
else
,
''
scoffed
Amory
.
``
You
know
you
're
perfectly
*NL*
effulgent
.
''
He
asked
her
the
one
thing
that
he
knew
might
embarrass
her
.
*NL*
It
was
the
remark
that
the
first
bore
made
to
Adam
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
about
yourself
.
''
And
she
gave
the
answer
that
Adam
must
have
*NL*
given
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
nothing
to
tell
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
eventually
Adam
probably
told
the
bore
all
the
things
he
thought
*NL*
about
at
night
when
the
locusts
sang
in
the
sandy
grass
,
and
he
must
*NL*
have
remarked
patronizingly
how
_
different
_
he
was
from
Eve
,
forgetting
*NL*
how
different
she
was
from
him
...
at
any
rate
,
Clara
told
Amory
much
*NL*
about
herself
that
evening
.
She
had
had
a
harried
life
from
sixteen
on
,
*NL*
and
her
education
had
stopped
sharply
with
her
leisure
.
Browsing
in
her
*NL*
library
,
Amory
found
a
tattered
gray
book
out
of
which
fell
a
yellow
*NL*
sheet
that
he
impudently
opened
.
It
was
a
poem
that
she
had
written
*NL*
at
school
about
a
gray
convent
wall
on
a
gray
day
,
and
a
girl
with
*NL*
her
cloak
blown
by
the
wind
sitting
atop
of
it
and
thinking
about
the
*NL*
many-colored
world
.
As
a
rule
such
sentiment
bored
him
,
but
this
was
*NL*
done
with
so
much
simplicity
and
atmosphere
,
that
it
brought
a
picture
*NL*
of
Clara
to
his
mind
,
of
Clara
on
such
a
cool
,
gray
day
with
her
keen
*NL*
blue
eyes
staring
out
,
trying
to
see
her
tragedies
come
marching
over
*NL*
the
gardens
outside
.
He
envied
that
poem
.
How
he
would
have
loved
to
*NL*
have
come
along
and
seen
her
on
the
wall
and
talked
nonsense
or
romance
*NL*
to
her
,
perched
above
him
in
the
air
.
He
began
to
be
frightfully
jealous
*NL*
of
everything
about
Clara
:
of
her
past
,
of
her
babies
,
of
the
men
and
*NL*
women
who
flocked
to
drink
deep
of
her
cool
kindness
and
rest
their
*NL*
tired
minds
as
at
an
absorbing
play
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Nobody
_
seems
to
bore
you
,
''
he
objected
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
About
half
the
world
do
,
''
she
admitted
,
``
but
I
think
that
's
a
pretty
*NL*
good
average
,
do
n't
you
?
''
and
she
turned
to
find
something
in
Browning
*NL*
that
bore
on
the
subject
.
She
was
the
only
person
he
ever
met
who
*NL*
could
look
up
passages
and
quotations
to
show
him
in
the
middle
of
*NL*
the
conversation
,
and
yet
not
be
irritating
to
distraction
.
She
did
it
*NL*
constantly
,
with
such
a
serious
enthusiasm
that
he
grew
fond
of
watching
*NL*
her
golden
hair
bent
over
a
book
,
brow
wrinkled
ever
so
little
at
*NL*
hunting
her
sentence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Through
early
March
he
took
to
going
to
Philadelphia
for
week-ends
.
*NL*
Almost
always
there
was
some
one
else
there
and
she
seemed
not
anxious
*NL*
to
see
him
alone
,
for
many
occasions
presented
themselves
when
a
word
*NL*
from
her
would
have
given
him
another
delicious
half-hour
of
adoration
.
*NL*
But
he
fell
gradually
in
love
and
began
to
speculate
wildly
on
marriage
.
*NL*
Though
this
design
flowed
through
his
brain
even
to
his
lips
,
still
*NL*
he
knew
afterward
that
the
desire
had
not
been
deeply
rooted
.
Once
he
*NL*
dreamt
that
it
had
come
true
and
woke
up
in
a
cold
panic
,
for
in
his
*NL*
dream
she
had
been
a
silly
,
flaxen
Clara
,
with
the
gold
gone
out
of
her
*NL*
hair
and
platitudes
falling
insipidly
from
her
changeling
tongue
.
But
*NL*
she
was
the
first
fine
woman
he
ever
knew
and
one
of
the
few
good
people
*NL*
who
ever
interested
him
.
She
made
her
goodness
such
an
asset
.
Amory
*NL*
had
decided
that
most
good
people
either
dragged
theirs
after
them
as
a
*NL*
liability
,
or
else
distorted
it
to
artificial
geniality
,
and
of
course
*NL*
there
were
the
ever-present
prig
and
Pharisee
--
-LRB-
but
Amory
never
included
*NL*
_
them
_
as
being
among
the
saved

*NL*
*NL*
Clara
did
n't
gloat
.
She
changed
the
subject
immediately
.
But
she
had
*NL*
started
him
thinking
and
he
believed
she
was
partly
right
.
He
felt
like
*NL*
a
factory-owner
who
after
accusing
a
clerk
of
dishonesty
finds
that
his
*NL*
own
son
,
in
the
office
,
is
changing
the
books
once
a
week
.
His
poor
,
*NL*
mistreated
will
that
he
had
been
holding
up
to
the
scorn
of
himself
and
*NL*
his
friends
,
stood
before
him
innocent
,
and
his
judgment
walked
off
to
*NL*
prison
with
the
unconfinable
imp
,
imagination
,
dancing
in
mocking
glee
*NL*
beside
him
.
Clara
's
was
the
only
advice
he
ever
asked
without
dictating
*NL*
the
answer
himself
--
except
,
perhaps
,
in
his
talks
with
Monsignor
Darcy
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
he
loved
to
do
any
sort
of
thing
with
Clara
!
Shopping
with
her
was
a
*NL*
rare
,
epicurean
dream
.
In
every
store
where
she
had
ever
traded
she
was
*NL*
whispered
about
as
the
beautiful
Mrs.

*NL*
*NL*
``

Enter

And

beamed
on
all
alike

Amory
believed
that
tradespeople
gave
her
*NL*
discounts
,
sometimes
to
her
knowledge
and
sometimes
without
it
.
He
knew
*NL*
she
dressed
very
well

had
always
the
best
of
everything
in
the
house
,
*NL*
and
was
inevitably
waited
upon
by
the
head
floor-walker
at
the
very
*NL*
least
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
they
would
go
to
church
together
on
Sunday
and
he
would
walk
*NL*
beside
her
and
revel
in
her
cheeks
moist
from
the
soft
water
in
the
new
*NL*
air
.
She
was
very
devout
,
always
had
been
,
and
God
knows
what
heights
*NL*
she
attained
and
what
strength
she
drew
down
to
herself
when
she
knelt
*NL*
and
bent
her
golden
hair
into
the
stained-glass
light
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

he
cried
aloud
one
day
,
quite
involuntarily

and
the
*NL*
people
turned
and
peered
,
and
the
priest
paused
in
his
sermon
and
Clara
*NL*
and
Amory
turned
to
fiery
red
.

*NL*
That
was

last
Sunday

for
he
spoiled
it
all
that
night

He
*NL*
could
n't
help
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
walking
through
the
March
twilight
where
it
was
as
warm
as
*NL*
June
,
and
the
joy
of
youth
filled
his
soul
so
that
he
felt
he
must
*NL*
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

he
said
and
his
voice
trembled
,
``
that

I
lost
faith
in
you

I
'd
lose
faith
in
God

''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
at
him
with
such
a
startled
face
that
he
asked
her
the
*NL*
matter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
,
''
she
said
slowly
,
``
only
this
:
five
men
have
said
that
to
me
*NL*
before
,
and
it
frightens
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Clara
,
is
that
your

''
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose

to
you
is

''
he
began
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
turned
like
a
flash
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
never
been

*NL*
*NL*
They
walked
along
,
and
he
realized
slowly
how
much
she
had
told
him
...
*NL*
never
in
love
...
She
seemed
suddenly
a
daughter
of
light
alone
.
His
*NL*
entity
dropped
out
of
her
plane
and
he
longed
only
to
touch
her
dress
*NL*
with
almost
the
realization
that
Joseph
must
have
had
of
Mary
's
eternal
*NL*
significance
.
But
quite
mechanically
he
heard
himself
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
love
you

any
latent
greatness
that

She
shook
her
head

said

She
broke
off
suddenly

he
said
wonderingly
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
There
you
go

running
through

He
smiled
unwillingly
.

*NL*
``

she
said
intently

taking

his
arm
and
opening
wide
her
eyes

he
could
see
their
kindliness
in
the
*NL*
fading
dusk

*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's

*NL*
*NL*
She
dropped
his
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
all
fine
now

I

Give
me

you

Well

I
do

about
once
a
month

*NL*
*NL*
And
then
that
wonderful
girl
and
Amory
raced
to
the
corner
like
two
mad
*NL*
children
gone
wild
with
pale-blue
twilight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
going
to
the
country
for
to-morrow
,
''
she
announced
,
as
she
stood
*NL*
panting
,
safe
beyond
the
flare
of
the
corner
lamp-post
.
``
These
days
are
*NL*
too
magnificent
to
miss
,
though
perhaps
I
feel
them
more
in
the
city
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Clara
!
''
Amory
said
;
``
what
a
devil
you
could
have
been
if
the
Lord
*NL*
had
just
bent
your
soul
a
little
the
other
way
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Maybe
,
''
she
answered
;
``
but
I
think
not
.
I
'm
never
really
wild
and
never
*NL*
have
been

That
little
outburst
was
pure
spring
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
are

too

said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
walking
along
now

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

you
're
wrong
again
,
how
can
a
person
of
your
own
self-reputed
*NL*
brains
be
so
constantly
wrong
about
me
?
I
'm
the
opposite
of
everything
*NL*
spring
ever
stood
for
.
It
's
unfortunate
,
if
I
happen
to
look
like
what
*NL*
pleased
some
soppy
old
Greek
sculptor
,
but
I
assure
you
that
if
it
*NL*
were
n't
for
my
face
I
'd
be
a
quiet
nun
in
the
convent
without
''
--
then
*NL*
she
broke
into
a
run
and
her
raised
voice
floated
back
to
him
as
he
*NL*
followed
--
``
my
precious
babies
,
which
I
must
go
back
and
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
the
only
girl
he
ever
knew
with
whom
he
could
understand
how
*NL*
another
man
might
be
preferred
.
Often
Amory
met
wives
whom
he
had
known
*NL*
as
debutantes
,
and
looking
intently
at
them
imagined
that
he
found
*NL*
something
in
their
faces
which
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
if
I
could
only
have
gotten
_
you
!
_
''
Oh
,
the
enormous
conceit
of
the
*NL*
man
!
*NL*
*NL*
But
that
night
seemed
a
night
of
stars
and
singing
and
Clara
's
bright
*NL*
soul
still
gleamed
on
the
ways
they
had
trod
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Golden
,
golden
is
the
air

''
he
chanted
to
the
little
pools
of
water
.
*NL*
...
``
Golden
is
the

golden

golden
mandolins

oh

wearily
fair

Skeins
from
braided
*NL*
basket
,
mortals
may
not

oh

what
young
extravagant

*NL*
AMORY
IS
RESENTFUL
*NL*
*NL*
Slowly
and
inevitably
,
yet
with
a
sudden
surge
at
the
last
,
while
Amory
*NL*
talked
and
dreamed
,
war
rolled
swiftly
up
the
beach
and
washed
the
sands
*NL*
where
Princeton
played
.
Every
night
the
gymnasium
echoed
as
platoon
*NL*
after
platoon
swept
over
the
floor
and
shuffled
out
the
basket-ball
*NL*
markings
.
When
Amory
went
to
Washington
the
next
week-end
he
caught
some
*NL*
of
the
spirit
of
crisis
which
changed
to
repulsion
in
the
Pullman
car
*NL*
coming
back
,
for
the
berths
across
from
him
were
occupied
by
stinking
*NL*
aliens
--
Greeks
,
he
guessed
,
or
Russians
.
He
thought
how
much
easier
*NL*
patriotism
had
been
to
a
homogeneous
race
,
how
much
easier
it
would
have
*NL*
been
to
fight
as
the
Colonies
fought
,
or
as
the
Confederacy
fought
.
And
*NL*
he
did
no
sleeping
that
night
,
but
listened
to
the
aliens
guffaw
and
*NL*
snore
while
they
filled
the
car
with
the
heavy
scent
of
latest
America
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
Princeton
every
one
bantered
in
public
and
told
themselves
privately
*NL*
that
their
deaths
at
least
would
be
heroic
.
The
literary
students
read
*NL*
Rupert
Brooke
passionately
;
the
lounge-lizards
worried
over
whether
the
*NL*
government
would
permit
the
English-cut
uniform
for
officers
;
a
few
of
*NL*
the
hopelessly
lazy
wrote
to
the
obscure
branches
of
the
War
Department
,
*NL*
seeking
an
easy
commission
and
a
soft
berth
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
after
a
week
,
Amory
saw
Burne
and
knew
at
once
that
argument
would
*NL*
be
futile
--
Burne
had
come
out
as
a
pacifist
.
The
socialist
magazines
,
*NL*
a
great
smattering
of
Tolstoi
,
and
his
own
intense
longing
for
a
cause
*NL*
that
would
bring
out
whatever
strength
lay
in
him
,
had
finally
decided
*NL*
him
to
preach
peace
as
a
subjective
ideal
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
the
German
army
entered
Belgium
,
''
he
began
,
``
if
the
inhabitants
*NL*
had
gone
peaceably
about
their
business
,
the
German
army
would
have
been
*NL*
disorganized
in
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
,
''
Amory
interrupted
,
``
I
've
heard
it
all

But
I
'm
not
going
to
*NL*
talk

with
you

There
's
a
chance
that
you
're
right
--
but
even
*NL*
so
we
're
hundreds
of
years
before
the
time
when
non-resistance
can
touch
*NL*
us
as
a
reality
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
Amory
,
listen

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Burne

we
'd
just

*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
one
thing

I
do

know

do
you
know
that
the
magazines

*NL*

said
slowly
.

'm
taking
this

naturally
I
think
that
it
's
my
most
innermost
conviction

it
seems
a
*NL*
path
spread
before
me
just
now

''
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
's
heart
sank
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
think
of
the
cheapness
of
it

no
one
's
really
going
to
martyr

for

pacifist

it
's
just
going
to
throw
you
in
with
the
worst

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

he
interrupted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

it
all
smells
of
Bohemian
New

*NL*

*NL*
``

always
felt

was
the
thing
that
occurred
to
Paul
on

stands
the
*NL*
huge
spectre
of

as

be

this
spectre
stands

right

Amory
broke
off
suddenly

*NL*
As
he
walked
away
it
seemed
to
Amory
that
the
look
in
his
face
bore
*NL*
a
great
resemblance
to
that
in
Kerry
's
when
he
had
said
good-by
under
*NL*
Blair
Arch
two
years
before
.
Amory
wondered
unhappily
why
he
could
never
*NL*
go
into
anything
with
the
primal
honesty
of
those
two
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Burne
's
a
fanatic
,
''
he
said
to
Tom
,
``

he
's
dead
wrong

'm
*NL*
inclined
to
think
,
just
an
unconscious
pawn
in
the
hands
of
anarchistic
*NL*
publishers
and
German-paid
rag
wavers
--
but
he
haunts
me
--
just
leaving
*NL*
everything
worth
while
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Burne
left
in
a
quietly
dramatic
manner
a
week
later
.
He
sold
all
his
*NL*
possessions
and
came
down
to
the
room
to
say
good-by
,
with
a
battered
*NL*
old
bicycle
,
on
which
he
intended
to
ride
to
his
home
in
Pennsylvania
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Peter
the
Hermit
bidding
farewell
to
Cardinal
Richelieu
,
''
suggested
*NL*
Alec
,
who
was
lounging
in
the
window-seat
as
Burne
and
Amory
shook
*NL*
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Amory
was
not
in
a
mood
for
that
,
and
as
he
saw
Burne
's
long
legs
*NL*
propel
his
ridiculous
bicycle
out
of
sight
beyond
Alexander
Hall
,
*NL*
he
knew
he
was
going
to
have
a
bad
week
.
Not
that
he
doubted
the
*NL*
war
--
Germany
stood
for
everything
repugnant
to
him
;
for
materialism
and
*NL*
the
direction
of
tremendous
licentious
force
;
it
was
just
that
Burne
's
*NL*
face
stayed
in
his
memory
and
he
was
sick
of
the
hysteria
he
was
*NL*
beginning
to
hear
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
on
earth
is
the
use
of
suddenly
running
down
Goethe
,
''
he
declared
*NL*
to
Alec
and
Tom
.
``
Why
write
books
to
prove
he
started
the
war
--
or
that
*NL*
that
stupid
,
overestimated
Schiller
is
a
demon
in
disguise
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
ever
read
anything

asked
Tom
shrewdly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

Amory
admitted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Neither

''
he
said
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
People
will
shout
,
''
said
Alec
quietly
,
``
but
Goethe
's
on
his
same
old
*NL*
shelf
in
the
library
--
to
bore
any
one
that
wants
to
read
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
subsided
,
and
the
subject
dropped
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
going
to
do
,
Amory
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Infantry
or
aviation
,
I
ca
n't
make
up
my
mind
--
I
hate
mechanics
,
but
*NL*
then
of
course
aviation
's
the
thing
for
me
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
feel
as
Amory
does
,
''
said
Tom
.
``
Infantry
or
aviation
--
aviation
sounds
*NL*
like
the
romantic
side
of
the
war
,
of
course
--
like
cavalry
used
to
be
,
*NL*
you
know
;
but
like
Amory
I
do
n't
know
a
horse-power
from
a
piston-rod
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Somehow
Amory
's
dissatisfaction
with
his
lack
of
enthusiasm
culminated
*NL*
in
an
attempt
to
put
the
blame
for
the
whole
war
on
the
ancestors
of
his
*NL*
generation
...
all
the
people
who
cheered
for
Germany
in
1870
...
All
*NL*
the
materialists
rampant
,
all
the
idolizers
of
German
science
and
*NL*
efficiency
.
So
he
sat
one
day
in
an
English
lecture
and
heard
``
Locksley
*NL*
Hall
''
quoted
and
fell
into
a
brown
study
with
contempt
for
Tennyson
and
*NL*
all
he
stood
for
--
for
he
took
him
as
a
representative
of
the
Victorians
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Victorians
,
Victorians
,
who
never
learned
to
weep
*NL*
Who
sowed
the
bitter
harvest
that
your
children
go
to
reap
--
*NL*
*NL*
scribbled
Amory
in
his
note-book
.
The
lecturer
was
saying
something
*NL*
about
Tennyson
's
solidity
and
fifty
heads
were
bent
to
take
notes
.
Amory
*NL*
turned
over
to
a
fresh
page
and
began
scrawling
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
shuddered
when
they
found
what
Mr.
Darwin
was
about
,
*NL*
They
shuddered
when
the
waltz
came
in
and
Newman
hurried
out
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
waltz
came
in
much
earlier
;
he
crossed
that
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
entitled
A
Song
in
the
Time
of
Order
,
''
came
the
professor
's
voice
,
*NL*
droning
far
away
.
``
Time
of
Order
''
--
Good
Lord
!
Everything
crammed
in
*NL*
the
box
and
the
Victorians
sitting
on
the
lid
smiling
serenely
...
With
*NL*
Browning
in
his
Italian
villa
crying
bravely
:
``
All
's
for
the
best
.
''
*NL*
Amory
scribbled
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
knelt
up
in
the
temple

he
bent
to
hear
you
pray

glorious
gains

reproached
him
for

`
Cathay
.

''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Why
could
he
never
get
more
than
a
couplet
at
a
time
?
Now
he
needed
*NL*
something
to
rhyme
with
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
would
keep
Him
straight
with
science

had
gone
wrong

*NL*
Well

anyway

*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
At
last
Amory
had
it
.
He
turned
over
another
page
and
scrawled
*NL*
vigorously
for
the
twenty
minutes
that
was
left
of
the
hour
.
Then
he
*NL*
walked
up
to
the
desk
and
deposited
a
page
torn
out
of
his
note-book
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here

he
said
coldly

The

picked
it
up
curiously

backed
rapidly
through

door

Here
is

THE
END
OF
MANY
THINGS
*NL*
*NL*
Early
April
slipped
by
in
a
haze
--
a
haze
of
long
evenings
on
the
club
*NL*
veranda
with
the
graphophone
playing
``
Poor
Butterfly
''
inside
...
for
*NL*
``
Poor
Butterfly
''
had
been
the
song
of
that
last
year
.
The
war
seemed
*NL*
scarcely
to
touch
them
and
it
might
have
been
one
of
the
senior
springs
*NL*
of
the
past
,
except
for
the
drilling
every
other
afternoon
,
yet
Amory
*NL*
realized
poignantly
that
this
was
the
last
spring
under
the
old
regime
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
the
great
protest
against
the
superman
,
''
said
Amory
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
so
,
''
Alec
agreed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
absolutely
irreconcilable
with
any
Utopia
.
As
long
as
he
occurs
,
*NL*
there
's
trouble
and
all
the
latent
evil
that
makes
a
crowd
list
and
sway
*NL*
when
he
talks
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
of
course
all
that
he
is
is
a
gifted
man
without
a
moral
sense
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
all
.
I
think
the
worst
thing
to
contemplate
is
this
--
it
's
*NL*
all
happened
before
,
how
soon
will
it
happen
again
?
Fifty
years
after
*NL*
Waterloo
Napoleon
was
as
much
a
hero
to
English
school
children
*NL*
as
Wellington
.
How
do
we
know
our
grandchildren
wo
n't
idolize
Von
*NL*
Hindenburg
the
same
way
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
brings
it
about
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Time
,
damn
it
,
and
the
historian
.
If
we
could
only
learn
to
look
*NL*
on
evil
as
evil
,
whether
it
's
clothed
in
filth
or
monotony
or
*NL*
magnificence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
!
Have
n't
we
raked
the
universe
over
the
coals
for
four
years
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
the
night
came
that
was
to
be
the
last
.
Tom
and
Amory
,
bound
in
the
*NL*
morning
for
different
training-camps
,
paced
the
shadowy
walks
as
usual
*NL*
and
seemed
still
to
see
around
them
the
faces
of
the
men
they
knew
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
grass
is
full
of
ghosts
to-night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
whole
campus
is
alive
with
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
paused
by
Little
and
watched
the
moon
rise
,
to
make
silver
of
the
*NL*
slate
roof
of
Dodd
and
blue
the
rustling
trees
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know

''
whispered
Tom
,
``
what
we
feel
now
is
the
sense

all

*NL*
gorgeous
youth

hundred
years

''
*NL*
*NL*
A
last
burst
of
singing
flooded
up
from
Blair
Arch
--
broken
voices
for
*NL*
some
long
parting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
we
leave
here
is
more
than
this

it

the
whole

We
're
just
one
generation
--
we
're
breaking
all
the
links
that
*NL*
seemed
to
bind
us
here
to
top-booted
and
high-stocked
generations

We
've
*NL*
walked
arm

with
Burr
and
Light-Horse
Harry
Lee
through
half
*NL*
these
deep-blue
nights

*NL*
*NL*
``

what

Tom
tangented
off

called
toward

*NL*
His
voice
echoed
in
the
stillness

*NL*
*NL*
``
The

whispered
Tom
.
``
Ah

Messalina

''
*NL*
*NL*
For
an
instant
the
voices
of
freshman
year
surged
around
them
and
then
*NL*
they
looked
at
each
other
with
faint
tears
in
their
eyes

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*

The
last
light
fades
and
drifts
across
the
land
--
the
low
,
long
land
,
the
*NL*
sunny
land
of
spires
;
the
ghosts
of
evening
tune
again
their
lyres
and
*NL*
wander
singing
in
a
plaintive
band
down
the
long
corridors
of
trees
;
*NL*
pale
fires
echo
the
night
from
tower
top
to
tower
:
Oh

sleep
that
*NL*
dreams

and
dream
that
never
tires

press
from
the
petals
of
the
lotus
*NL*
flower
something
of
this
to
keep

the
essence

an
hour

*NL*
No
more
to
wait
the
twilight
of
the
moon
in
this
sequestered
vale
of
*NL*
star
and
spire
,
for
one
eternal
morning
of
desire
passes
to
time
and
*NL*
earthy
afternoon

did
you
find
in

hurled
down

this
midnight
*NL*
my

A
letter
dated

written

Monsignor
Darcy
to
Amory

who
*NL*
is
a
second
lieutenant
in

Port

Camp
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
MY
DEAR
BOY
:
*NL*
*NL*
All
you
need
tell
me
of
yourself
is
that
you
still
are
;
for
the
rest
I
*NL*
merely
search
back
in
a
restive
memory
,
a
thermometer
that
records
only
*NL*
fevers
,
and
match
you
with
what
I
was
at
your
age
.
But
men
will
chatter
*NL*
and
you
and
I
will
still
shout
our
futilities
to
each
other
across
*NL*
the
stage
until
the
last
silly
curtain
falls
_
plump
!
_
upon
our
bobbing
*NL*
heads
.
But
you
are
starting
the
spluttering
magic-lantern
show
of
life
*NL*
with
much
the
same
array
of
slides
as
I
had
,
so
I
need
to
write
you
if
*NL*
only
to
shriek
the
colossal
stupidity
of
people
...
*NL*
*NL*
This
is
the
end
of
one
thing
:
for
better
or
worse
you
will
never
again
*NL*
be
quite
the
Amory
Blaine
that
I
knew
,
never
again
will
we
meet
as
we
*NL*
have
met
,
because
your
generation
is
growing
hard
,
much
harder
than
mine
*NL*
ever
grew
,
nourished
as
they
were
on
the
stuff
of
the
nineties
.
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
,
lately
I
reread
Aeschylus
and
there
in
the
divine
irony
of
the
*NL*
``
Agamemnon
''
I
find
the
only
answer
to
this
bitter
age
--
all
the
world
*NL*
tumbled
about
our
ears
,
and
the
closest
parallel
ages
back
in
that
*NL*
hopeless
resignation
.
There
are
times
when
I
think
of
the
men
out
there
*NL*
as
Roman
legionaries
,
miles
from
their
corrupt
city
,
stemming
back
the
*NL*
hordes
...
hordes
a
little
more
menacing
,
after
all
,
than
the
corrupt
*NL*
city
...
another
blind
blow
at
the
race
,
furies
that
we
passed
with
*NL*
ovations
years
ago
,
over
whose
corpses
we
bleated
triumphantly
all
*NL*
through
the
Victorian
era
...
*NL*
*NL*
And
afterward
an
out-and-out
materialistic
world
--
and
the
Catholic
*NL*
Church
.
I
wonder
where
you
'll
fit
in
.
Of
one
thing
I
'm
sure
--
Celtic
*NL*
you
'll
live
and
Celtic
you
'll
die
;
so
if
you
do
n't
use
heaven
as
a
*NL*
continual
referendum
for
your
ideas
you
'll
find
earth
a
continual
recall
*NL*
to
your
ambitions
.
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
,
I
've
discovered
suddenly
that
I
'm
an
old
man
.
Like
all
old
*NL*
men
,
I
've
had
dreams
sometimes
and
I
'm
going
to
tell
you
of
them
.
I
've
*NL*
enjoyed
imagining
that
you
were
my
son
,
that
perhaps
when
I
was
young
*NL*
I
went
into
a
state
of
coma
and
begat
you
,
and
when
I
came
to
,
had
no
*NL*
recollection
of
it
...
it
's
the
paternal
instinct
,
Amory
--
celibacy
goes
*NL*
deeper
than
the
flesh
...
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
I
think
that
the
explanation
of
our
deep
resemblance
is
some
*NL*
common
ancestor
,
and
I
find
that
the
only
blood
that
the
Darcys
and
*NL*
the
O'Haras
have
in
common
is
that
of
the
O'Donahues
...
Stephen
was
his
*NL*
name
,
I
think
...
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
lightning
strikes
one
of
us
it
strikes
both
:
you
had
hardly
*NL*
arrived
at
the
port
of
embarkation
when
I
got
my
papers
to
start
for
*NL*
Rome
,
and
I
am
waiting
every
moment
to
be
told
where
to
take
ship
.
Even
*NL*
before
you
get
this
letter
I
shall
be
on
the
ocean
;
then
will
come
your
*NL*
turn
.
You
went
to
war
as
a
gentleman
should
,
just
as
you
went
to
school
*NL*
and
college
,
because
it
was
the
thing
to
do
.
It
's
better
to
leave
the
*NL*
blustering
and
tremulo-heroism
to
the
middle
classes
;
they
do
it
so
much
*NL*
better
.
*NL*
*NL*
Do
you
remember
that
week-end
last
March
when
you
brought
Burne
Holiday
*NL*
from
Princeton
to
see
me
?
What
a
magnificent
boy
he
is
!
It
gave
me
a
*NL*
frightful
shock
afterward
when
you
wrote
that
he
thought
me
splendid
;
*NL*
how
could
he
be
so
deceived
?
Splendid
is
the
one
thing
that
neither
you
*NL*
nor
I
are
.
We
are
many
other
things
--
we
're
extraordinary
,
we
're
clever
,
*NL*
we
could
be
said
,
I
suppose
,
to
be
brilliant
.
We
can
attract
people
,
*NL*
we
can
make
atmosphere
,
we
can
almost
lose
our
Celtic
souls
in
Celtic
*NL*
subtleties
,
we
can
almost
always
have
our
own
way
;
but
splendid
--
rather
*NL*
not
!
*NL*
*NL*
I
am
going
to
Rome
with
a
wonderful
dossier
and
letters
of
introduction
*NL*
that
cover
every
capital
in
Europe
,
and
there
will
be
``
no
small
stir
''
*NL*
when
I
get
there
.
How
I
wish
you
were
with
me
!
This
sounds
like
a
rather
*NL*
cynical
paragraph
,
not
at
all
the
sort
of
thing
that
a
middle-aged
*NL*
clergyman
should
write
to
a
youth
about
to
depart
for
the
war
;
the
only
*NL*
excuse
is
that
the
middle-aged
clergyman
is
talking
to
himself
.
There
*NL*
are
deep
things
in
us
and
you
know
what
they
are
as
well
as
I
do
.
We
*NL*
have
great
faith
,
though
yours
at
present
is
uncrystallized
;
we
have
a
*NL*
terrible
honesty
that
all
our
sophistry
can
not
destroy
and
,
above
all
,
a
*NL*
childlike
simplicity
that
keeps
us
from
ever
being
really
malicious
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
written
a
keen
for
you
which
follows
.
I
am
sorry
your
cheeks
are
*NL*
not
up
to
the
description
I
have
written
of
them
,
but
you
_
will
_
smoke
*NL*
and
read
all
night

*NL*
At
any
rate
here
it
is

EMBARKING
AT

*NL*
*NL*
Amory
moved
forward
on
the
deck
until
he
found
a
stool
under
an
electric
*NL*
light
.
He
searched
in
his
pocket
for
note-book
and
pencil
and
then
began
*NL*
to
write
,
slowly
,
laboriously
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
leave
to-night

*NL*
Silent
,
we
filled
the
still

deserted
street

*NL*
A
column

dim
gray
,
*NL*
And
ghosts
rose
startled
at
the
muffled
beat
*NL*
Along
the
moonless
way

The
shadowy
shipyards
echoed
to
the
feet

That
turned
from
night

day

so
we
linger
on

See
on

poor

Oh

shall

deplore

See
how

white

The

have
broken

burn

To
hollow

paved

gravelled

DEAR
BAUDELAIRE
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
We
meet
in
Manhattan
on
the
30th
of
this
very
mo.
;
we
then
proceed
to
*NL*
take
a
very
sporty
apartment
,
you
and
I
and
Alec
,
who
is
at
me
elbow
as
*NL*
I
write
.
I
do
n't
know
what
I
'm
going
to
do
but
I
have
a
vague
dream
of
*NL*
going
into
politics
.
Why
is
it
that
the
pick
of
the
young
Englishmen
*NL*
from
Oxford
and
Cambridge
go
into
politics
and
in
the
U.
S.
A.
we
leave
*NL*
it
to
the
muckers
?
--
raised
in
the
ward
,
educated
in
the
assembly
and
*NL*
sent
to
Congress
,
fat-paunched
bundles
of
corruption
,
devoid
of
``
both
*NL*
ideas
and
ideals
''
as
the
debaters
used
to
say
.
Even
forty
years
ago
we
*NL*
had
good
men
in
politics
,
but
we
,
we
are
brought
up
to
pile
up
a
million
*NL*
and
``
show
what
we
are
made
of
.
''
Sometimes
I
wish
I
'd
been
an
Englishman
;
*NL*
American
life
is
so
damned
dumb
and
stupid
and
healthy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Since
poor
Beatrice
died
I
'll
probably
have
a
little
money
,
but
very
*NL*
darn
little
.
I
can
forgive
mother
almost
everything
except
the
fact
that
*NL*
in
a
sudden
burst
of
religiosity
toward
the
end
,
she
left
half
of
what
*NL*
remained
to
be
spent
in
stained-glass
windows
and
seminary
endowments
.
*NL*
Mr.
Barton
,
my
lawyer
,
writes
me
that
my
thousands
are
mostly
in
street
*NL*
railways
and
that
the
said
Street
R.R.
s
are
losing
money
because
of
the
*NL*
five-cent
fares
.
Imagine
a
salary
list
that
gives
$
350
a
month
to
a
man
*NL*
that
ca
n't
read
and
write
!
--
yet
I
believe
in
it
,
even
though
I
've
*NL*
seen
what
was
once
a
sizable
fortune
melt
away
between
speculation
,
*NL*
extravagance
,
the
democratic
administration
,
and
the
income
tax
--
modern
,
*NL*
that
's
me
all
over
,
Mabel
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
any
rate
we
'll
have
really
knock-out
rooms
--
you
can
get
a
job
on
some
*NL*
fashion
magazine
,
and
Alec
can
go
into
the
Zinc
Company
or
whatever
it
*NL*
is
that
his
people
own
--
he
's
looking
over
my
shoulder
and
he
says
it
's
*NL*
a
brass
company
,
but
I
do
n't
think
it
matters
much
,
do
you
?
There
's
*NL*
probably
as
much
corruption
in
zinc-made
money
as
brass-made
money
.
As
*NL*
for
the
well-known
Amory
,
he
would
write
immortal
literature
if
he
were
*NL*
sure
enough
about
anything
to
risk
telling
any
one
else
about
it
.
*NL*
There
is
no
more
dangerous
gift
to
posterity
than
a
few
cleverly
turned
*NL*
platitudes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
,
why
do
n't
you
become
a
Catholic
?
Of
course
to
be
a
good
one
you
'd
*NL*
have
to
give
up
those
violent
intrigues
you
used
to
tell
me
about
,
*NL*
but
you
'd
write
better
poetry
if
you
were
linked
up
to
tall
golden
*NL*
candlesticks
and
long
,
even
chants
,
and
even
if
the
American
priests
are
*NL*
rather
burgeois
,
as
Beatrice
used
to
say
,
still
you
need
only
go
to
the
*NL*
sporty
churches
,
and
I
'll
introduce
you
to
Monsignor
Darcy
who
really
is
*NL*
a
wonder
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kerry
's
death
was
a
blow
,
so
was
Jesse
's
to
a
certain
extent
.
And
I
have
*NL*
a
great
curiosity
to
know
what
queer
corner
of
the
world
has
swallowed
*NL*
Burne
.
Do
you
suppose
he
's
in
prison
under
some
false
name
?
I
confess
*NL*
that
the
war
instead
of
making
me
orthodox
,
which
is
the
correct
*NL*
reaction
,
has
made
me
a
passionate
agnostic
.
The
Catholic
Church
has
had
*NL*
its
wings
clipped
so
often
lately
that
its
part
was
timidly
negligible
,
*NL*
and
they
have
n't
any
good
writers
any
more
.
I
'm
sick
of
Chesterton
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
've
only
discovered
one
soldier
who
passed
through
the
much-advertised
*NL*
spiritual
crisis
,
like
this
fellow
,
Donald
Hankey
,
and
the
one
I
knew
*NL*
was
already
studying
for
the
ministry
,
so
he
was
ripe
for
it
.
I
honestly
*NL*
think
that
's
all
pretty
much
rot
,
though
it
seemed
to
give
sentimental
*NL*
comfort
to
those
at
home
;
and
may
make
fathers
and
mothers
appreciate
*NL*
their
children
.
This
crisis-inspired
religion
is
rather
valueless
and
*NL*
fleeting
at
best
.
I
think
four
men
have
discovered
Paris
to
one
that
*NL*
discovered
God
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
us
--
you
and
me
and
Alec
--
oh
,
we
'll
get
a
Jap
butler
and
dress
for
*NL*
dinner
and
have
wine
on
the
table
and
lead
a
contemplative
,
emotionless
*NL*
life
until
we
decide
to
use
machine-guns
with
the
property
owners
--
or
*NL*
throw
bombs
with
the
Bolshevik
God
!
Tom
,
I
hope
something
happens
.
I
'm
*NL*
restless
as
the
devil
and
have
a
horror
of
getting
fat
or
falling
in
*NL*
love
and
growing
domestic
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
place
at
Lake
Geneva

now
for
rent
but

I
'm

Barton

details

The
Debutante
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
time
is
February
.
The
place
is
a
large
,
dainty
bedroom
in
the
*NL*
Connage
house
on
Sixty-eighth
Street
,
New
York
.
A
girl
's
room
:
pink
*NL*
walls
and
curtains
and
a
pink
bedspread
on
a
cream-colored
bed
.
Pink
and
*NL*
cream
are
the
motifs
of
the
room
,
but
the
only
article
of
furniture
*NL*
in
full
view
is
a
luxurious
dressing-table
with
a
glass
top
and
a
*NL*
three-sided
mirror
.
On
the
walls
there
is
an
expensive
print
of
``
Cherry
*NL*
Ripe
,
''
a
few
polite
dogs
by
Landseer
,
and
the
``
King
of
the
Black
Isles
,
''
*NL*
by
Maxfield
Parrish
.
*NL*
*NL*
Great
disorder
consisting
of
the
following
items
:
-LRB-
1
-RRB-
seven
or
eight
*NL*
empty
cardboard
boxes
,
with
tissue-paper
tongues
hanging
panting
from
*NL*
their
mouths
;
-LRB-
2
-RRB-
an
assortment
of
street
dresses
mingled
with
their
*NL*
sisters
of
the
evening
,
all
upon
the
table
,
all
evidently
new
;
-LRB-
3
-RRB-
a
*NL*
roll
of
tulle
,
which
has
lost
its
dignity
and
wound
itself
tortuously
*NL*
around
everything
in
sight
,
and
-LRB-
4
-RRB-
upon
the
two
small
chairs
,
a
*NL*
collection
of
lingerie
that
beggars
description
.
One
would
enjoy
seeing
*NL*
the
bill
called
forth
by
the
finery
displayed
and
one
is
possessed
by
*NL*
a
desire
to
see
the
princess
for
whose
benefit
--
Look
!
There
's
some
one
!
*NL*
Disappointment
!
This
is
only
a
maid
hunting
for
something
--
she
lifts
*NL*
a
heap
from
a
chair
--
Not
there
;
another
heap
,
the
dressing-table
,
the
*NL*
chiffonier
drawers
.
She
brings
to
light
several
beautiful
chemises
and
*NL*
an
amazing
pajama
but
this
does
not
satisfy
her
--
she
goes
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
indistinguishable
mumble
from
the
next
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
we
are
getting
warm
.
This
is
Alec
's
mother
,
Mrs.
Connage
,
ample
,
*NL*
dignified
,
rouged
to
the
dowager
point
and
quite
worn
out
.
Her
lips
move
*NL*
significantly
as
she
looks
for
IT
.
Her
search
is
less
thorough
than
the
*NL*
maid
's
but
there
is
a
touch
of
fury
in
it
,
that
quite
makes
up
for
its
*NL*
sketchiness
.
She
stumbles
on
the
tulle
and
her
``
damn
''
is
quite
audible
.
*NL*
She
retires
,
empty-handed
.
*NL*
*NL*
More
chatter
outside
and
a
girl
's
voice
,
a
very
spoiled
voice
,
says
:
``
Of
*NL*
all
the
stupid
people
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
pause
a
third
seeker
enters
,
not
she
of
the
spoiled
voice
,
but
*NL*
a
younger
edition
.
This
is
Cecelia
Connage
,
sixteen
,
pretty
,
shrewd
,
and
*NL*
constitutionally
good-humored
.
She
is
dressed
for
the
evening
in
a
gown
*NL*
the
obvious
simplicity
of
which
probably
bores
her
.
She
goes
to
the
*NL*
nearest
pile
,
selects
a
small
pink
garment
and
holds
it
up
appraisingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
CECELIA
:
Pink
?
*NL*
*NL*
ROSALIND
:
-LRB-

ROSALIND
:

CECELIA
:

-LRB-
She
sees
herself
in
the
mirror
of
the
dressing-table
and
commences
to
*NL*
shimmy
enthusiastically
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
ROSALIND
:
-LRB-
Outside
-RRB-
What
are

it
on

CECELIA
ceases
and
goes
out
carrying
the
garment
at
the
right
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
other
door
,
enters
ALEC
CONNAGE
.
He
looks
around
quickly
and
in
*NL*
a
huge
voice
shouts
:
Mama
!
There
is
a
chorus
of
protest
from
next
door
*NL*
and
encouraged
he
starts
toward
it
,
but
is
repelled
by
another
chorus
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
ALEC
:
So
_
that
's
_
where
you
all
are
!
Amory
Blaine
is

*NL*
*NL*
CECELIA
:
-LRB-
Quickly
-RRB-
Take
him
down-stairs

*NL*
*NL*
ALEC
:
Oh

_
is
_
down-stairs

*NL*
*NL*
MRS.
CONNAGE
:
Well

you
can
show
him
where
his
room
is

Tell
him
I
'm
*NL*
sorry
that
I
ca
n't
meet
him
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
ALEC
:
He
's
heard
a
lot
about
you
all
.
I
wish
you
'd
hurry
.
Father
's
*NL*
telling
him
all
about
the
war
and
he
's
restless
.
He
's
sort
of
*NL*
temperamental
.
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
This
last
suffices
to
draw
CECELIA
into
the
room

-RRB-

*NL*
CECELIA
:
-LRB-
Seating
herself
high
upon
lingerie
-RRB-
How
do
you
*NL*
mean

temperamental

You
used
to
say
that
about

letters

writes
stuff

CECELIA

Speculatively

Drink
?
*NL*
*NL*
ALEC
:
Yes

nothing
queer
about
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
CECELIA
:
Money
?
*NL*
*NL*
ALEC
:
Good
Lord
--
ask
him

he
used
to
have
a
lot
,
and
he
's
got
some
*NL*
income
now

-LRB-
MRS.

*NL*
MRS.
CONNAGE

,
of

we
're
glad
to
have
any

yours

*NL*
*NL*
ALEC
:
You
certainly
ought
to
meet
Amory
.
*NL*
*NL*
MRS.
CONNAGE
:
Of
course
,
I
want
to
.
But
I
think
it
's
so
childish
of
you
*NL*
to
leave
a
perfectly
good
home
to
go
and
live
with
two
other
boys
in
*NL*
some
impossible
apartment
.
I
hope
it
is
n't
in
order
that
you
can
all
*NL*
drink
as
much
as
you
want
.
-LRB-
She
pauses

-RRB-
He
'll
be
a
little
neglected
*NL*
to-night

This

still
to
meet
the
man
she
ca
n't
outdistance
.
*NL*
Honestly
,
Alec
,
she
treats
men
terribly
.
She
abuses
them
and
cuts
them
*NL*
and
breaks
dates
with
them
and
yawns
in
their
faces
--
and
they
come
back
*NL*
for
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
ALEC
:
They
love
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
CECELIA
:
They
hate
it
.
She
's
a
--
she
's
a
sort
of
vampire
,
I
think
--
and
*NL*
she
can
make
girls
do
what
she
wants
usually
--
only
she
hates
girls
.
*NL*
*NL*
ALEC
:
Personality
runs
in
our
family
.
*NL*
*NL*
CECELIA
:
-LRB-
Resignedly
-RRB-
I
guess
it
ran
out
before
it
got
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
ALEC
:
Does
Rosalind
behave
herself
?
*NL*
*NL*
CECELIA
:
Not
particularly
well
.
Oh
,
she
's
average
--
smokes
sometimes
,
*NL*
drinks
punch
,
frequently
kissed
--
Oh
,
yes
--
common
knowledge
--
one
of
the
*NL*
effects
of
the
war
,
you
know
.
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
Emerges
MRS.
CONNAGE
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
MRS.
CONNAGE
:
Rosalind
's
almost
finished
so
I
can
go
down
and
meet
your
*NL*
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
ALEC
and
his
mother
go
out
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
ROSALIND
:
-LRB-
Outside
-RRB-
Oh
,
mother
--
*NL*
*NL*
CECELIA
:
Mother
's
gone
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
And
now
ROSALIND
enters
.
ROSALIND
is
--
utterly
ROSALIND
.
She
is
one
of
*NL*
those
girls
who
need
never
make
the
slightest
effort
to
have
men
fall
in
*NL*
love
with
them
.
Two
types
of
men
seldom
do
:
dull
men
are
usually
afraid
*NL*
of
her
cleverness
and
intellectual
men
are
usually
afraid
of
her
beauty
.
*NL*
All
others
are
hers
by
natural
prerogative
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
ROSALIND
could
be
spoiled
the
process
would
have
been
complete
by
*NL*
this
time
,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
,
her
disposition
is
not
all
it
should
*NL*
be
;
she
wants
what
she
wants
when
she
wants
it
and
she
is
prone
to
make
*NL*
every
one
around
her
pretty
miserable
when
she
does
n't
get
it
--
but
in
*NL*
the
true
sense
she
is
not
spoiled
.
Her
fresh
enthusiasm
,
her
will
to
*NL*
grow
and
learn
,
her
endless
faith
in
the
inexhaustibility
of
romance
,
*NL*
her
courage
and
fundamental
honesty
--
these
things
are
not
spoiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
are
long
periods
when
she
cordially
loathes
her
whole
family
.
*NL*
She
is
quite
unprincipled
;
her
philosophy
is
carpe
diem
for
herself
*NL*
and
laissez
faire
for
others
.
She
loves
shocking
stories
:
she
has
that
*NL*
coarse
streak
that
usually
goes
with
natures
that
are
both
fine
and
big
.
*NL*
She
wants
people
to
like
her
,
but
if
they
do
not
it
never
worries
her
or
*NL*
changes
her
.
She
is
by
no
means
a
model
character
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
education
of
all
beautiful
women
is
the
knowledge
of
men
.
ROSALIND
*NL*
had
been
disappointed
in
man
after
man
as
individuals
,
but
she
had
great
*NL*
faith
in
man
as
a
sex
.
Women
she
detested
.
They
represented
qualities
*NL*
that
she
felt
and
despised
in
herself
--
incipient
meanness
,
conceit
,
*NL*
cowardice
,
and
petty
dishonesty
.
She
once
told
a
roomful
of
her
*NL*
mother
's
friends
that
the
only
excuse
for
women
was
the
necessity
for
*NL*
a
disturbing
element
among
men
.
She
danced
exceptionally
well
,
drew
*NL*
cleverly
but
hastily
,
and
had
a
startling
facility
with
words
,
which
she
*NL*
used
only
in
love-letters
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
all
criticism
of
ROSALIND
ends
in
her
beauty
.
There
was
that
shade
*NL*
of
glorious
yellow
hair
,
the
desire
to
imitate
which
supports
the
dye
*NL*
industry
.
There
was
the
eternal
kissable
mouth
,
small
,
slightly
sensual
,
*NL*
and
utterly
disturbing
.
There
were
gray
eyes
and
an
unimpeachable
skin
*NL*
with
two
spots
of
vanishing
color
.
She
was
slender
and
athletic
,
without
*NL*
underdevelopment
,
and
it
was
a
delight
to
watch
her
move
about
a
room
,
*NL*
walk
along
a
street
,
swing
a
golf
club
,
or
turn
a
``
cartwheel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
last
qualification
--
her
vivid
,
instant
personality
escaped
that
*NL*
conscious
,
theatrical
quality
that
AMORY
had
found
in
ISABELLE
.
*NL*
MONSIGNOR
DARCY
would
have
been
quite
up
a
tree
whether
to
call
her
*NL*
a
personality
or
a
personage
.
She
was
perhaps
the
delicious
,
*NL*
inexpressible
,
once-in-a-century
blend
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
night
of
her
debut
she
is
,
for
all
her
strange
,
stray
wisdom
,
*NL*
quite
like
a
happy
little
girl
.
Her
mother
's
maid
has
just
done
her
*NL*
hair
,
but
she
has
decided
impatiently
that
she
can
do
a
better
job
*NL*
herself
.
She
is
too
nervous
just
now
to
stay
in
one
place
.
To
that
*NL*
we
owe
her
presence
in
this
littered
room
.
She
is
going
to
speak
.
*NL*
ISABELLE
'S
alto
tones
had
been
like
a
violin
,
but
if
you
could
hear
*NL*
ROSALIND
,
you
would
say
her
voice
was
musical
as
a
waterfall
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
ROSALIND
:
Honestly
,
there
are
only
two
costumes
in
the
world
that
I
*NL*
really
enjoy
being
in
--
-LRB-
Combing
her
hair
at
the
dressing-table
.
-RRB-
One
's
*NL*
a
hoop
skirt
with
pantaloons
;
the
other
's
a
one-piece
bathing-suit
.
I
'm
*NL*
quite
charming
in
both
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
CECELIA
:
Glad
you
're
coming
out
?
*NL*
*NL*
ROSALIND
:
Yes
;
are
n't
you
?
*NL*
*NL*
CECELIA
:
-LRB-
Cynically
-RRB-
You
're
glad
so
you
can
get
married
and
live
on
Long
*NL*
Island
with
the
_
fast
younger
married
set
_
.
You
want
life
to
be
a
chain
*NL*
of
flirtation
with
a
man
for
every
link
.
*NL*
*NL*
ROSALIND
:
_
Want
_
it
to
be
one
!
You
mean
I
've
_
found
_
it
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
CECELIA
:
Ha
!
*NL*
*NL*
ROSALIND
:
Cecelia
,
darling
,
you
do
n't
know
what
a
trial
it
is
to
*NL*
be
--
like
me
.
I
've
got
to
keep
my
face
like
steel
in
the
street
to
keep
*NL*
men
from
winking
at
me
.
If
I
laugh
hard
from
a
front
row
in
the
theatre
,
*NL*
the
comedian
plays
to
me
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
.
If
I
drop
my
*NL*
voice
,
my
eyes
,
my
handkerchief
at
a
dance
,
my
partner
calls
me
up
on
*NL*
the
`
phone
every
day
for
a
week
.
*NL*
*NL*
CECELIA
:
It
must
be
an
awful
strain
.
*NL*
*NL*
ROSALIND
:
The
unfortunate
part
is
that
the
only
men
who
interest
me
at
*NL*
all
are
the
totally
ineligible
ones
.
Now
--
if
I
were
poor
I
'd
go
on
the
*NL*
stage
.
*NL*
*NL*
CECELIA
:
Yes
,
you
might
as
well
get
paid
for
the
amount
of
acting
you
*NL*
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
ROSALIND
:
Sometimes
when
I
've
felt
particularly
radiant
I
've
thought
,
*NL*
why
should
this
be
wasted
on
one
man
?
*NL*
*NL*
CECELIA
:
Often
when
you
're
particularly
sulky
,
I
've
wondered
why
it
*NL*
should
all
be
wasted
on
just
one
family
.
-LRB-
Getting
up
.
-RRB-
I
think
I
'll
go
*NL*
down
and
meet
Mr.
Amory
Blaine
.
I
like
temperamental
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
ROSALIND
:
There
are
n't
any
.
Men
do
n't
know
how
to
be
really
angry
or
*NL*
really
happy
--
and
the
ones
that
do
,
go
to
pieces
.
*NL*
*NL*
CECELIA
:
Well
,
I
'm
glad
I
do
n't
have
all
your
worries
.
I
'm
engaged
.
*NL*
*NL*
ROSALIND
:
-LRB-
With
a
scornful
smile
-RRB-
Engaged
?
Why
,
you
little
lunatic
!
*NL*
If
mother
heard
you
talking
like
that
she
'd
send
you
off
to
*NL*
boarding-school
,
where
you
belong
.
*NL*
*NL*
CECELIA
:
You
wo
n't
tell
her
,
though
,
because
I
know
things
I
could
*NL*
tell
--
and
you
're
too
selfish
!
*NL*
*NL*
ROSALIND
:
-LRB-
A
little
annoyed
-RRB-
Run
along
,
little
girl
!
Who
are
you
engaged
*NL*
to
,
the
iceman
?
the
man
that
keeps
the
candy-store
?
*NL*
*NL*
CECELIA
:
Cheap
wit
--
good-by
,
darling
,
I
'll
see
you
later
.
*NL*
*NL*
ROSALIND
:
Oh
,
be
_
sure
_
and
do
that
--
you
're
such
a
help
.
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
Exit
CECELIA
.
ROSALIND
finished
her
hair
and
rises
,
humming
.
She
goes
*NL*
up
to
the
mirror
and
starts
to
dance
in
front
of
it
on
the
soft
carpet
.
*NL*
She
watches
not
her
feet
,
but
her
eyes
--
never
casually
but
always
*NL*
intently
,
even
when
she
smiles
.
The
door
suddenly
opens
and
then
slams
*NL*
behind
AMORY
,
very
cool
and
handsome
as
usual
.
He
melts
into
instant
*NL*
confusion
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
HE
:
Oh
,
I
'm
sorry
.
I
thought
--
*NL*
*NL*
SHE
:
-LRB-
Smiling
radiantly
-RRB-
Oh
,
you
're
Amory
Blaine
,
are
n't
you
?
*NL*
*NL*
HE
:
-LRB-
Regarding
her
closely
-RRB-
And
you
're
Rosalind
?
*NL*
*NL*
SHE
:
I
'm
going
to
call
you
Amory
--
oh
,
come
in
--
it
's
all
right
--
mother
'll
*NL*
be
right
in
--
-LRB-
under
her
breath
-RRB-
unfortunately
.
*NL*
*NL*
HE
:
-LRB-
Gazing
around
-RRB-
This
is
sort
of
a
new
wrinkle
for
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
SHE
:
This
is
No
Man
's
Land
.
*NL*
*NL*
HE
:
This
is
where
you
--
you
--
-LRB-
pause
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
SHE
:
Yes
--
all
those
things
.
-LRB-
She
crosses
to
the
bureau
.
-RRB-
See
,
here
's
my
*NL*
rouge
--
eye
pencils
.
*NL*
*NL*
HE
:
I
did
n't
know
you
were
that
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
SHE
:
What
did
you
expect
?
*NL*
*NL*
HE
:
I
thought
you
'd
be
sort
of
--
sort
of
--
sexless
,
you
know
,
swim
and
*NL*
play
golf
.
*NL*
*NL*
SHE
:
Oh
,
I
do
--
but
not
in
business
hours
.
*NL*
*NL*
HE
:
Business
?
*NL*
*NL*
SHE
:
Six
to
two
--
strictly
.
*NL*
*NL*
HE
:
I
'd
like
to
have
some
stock
in
the
corporation
.
*NL*
*NL*
SHE
:
Oh
,
it
's
not
a
corporation
--
it
's
just
``
Rosalind
,
Unlimited
.
''
*NL*
Fifty-one
shares
,
name
,
good-will
,
and
everything
goes
at
$
25,000
a
*NL*
year
.
*NL*
*NL*
HE
:
-LRB-
Disapprovingly
-RRB-
Sort
of
a
chilly
proposition
.
*NL*
*NL*
SHE
:
Well
,
Amory
,
you
do
n't
mind
--
do
you
?
When
I
meet
a
man
that
does
n't
*NL*
bore
me
to
death
after
two
weeks
,
perhaps
it
'll
be
different
.
*NL*
*NL*
HE
:
Odd
,
you
have
the
same
point
of
view
on
men
that
I
have
on
women
.
*NL*
*NL*
SHE
:
I
'm
not
really
feminine
,
you
know
--
in
my
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
HE
:
-LRB-
Interested
-RRB-
Go
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
SHE
:
No
,
you
--
you
go
on
--
you
've
made
me
talk
about
myself
.
That
's
*NL*
against
the
rules
.
*NL*
*NL*
HE
:
Rules
?
*NL*
*NL*
SHE
:
My
own
rules
--
but
you
--
Oh
,
Amory
,
I
hear
you
're
brilliant
.
The
*NL*
family
expects
_
so
_
much
of
you
.
*NL*
*NL*
HE
:
How
encouraging
!
*NL*
*NL*
SHE
:
Alec
said
you
'd
taught
him
to
think
.
Did
you
?
I
did
n't
believe
any
*NL*
one
could
.
*NL*
*NL*
HE
:
No
.
I
'm
really
quite
dull
.
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
He
evidently
does
n't
intend
this
to
be
taken
seriously
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
SHE
:
Liar
.
*NL*
*NL*
HE
:
I

I
'm
religious

I
'm
literary
.
I

I
've
even
written
poems

*NL*
SHE

-LRB-
She
declaims

-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
The

The

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
HE
:
-LRB-
Laughing
-RRB-
No
,
not
that
kind
.
*NL*
*NL*
SHE
:
-LRB-
Suddenly
-RRB-
I
like
you
.
*NL*
*NL*
HE
:
Do
n't
.
*NL*
*NL*
SHE
:
Modest
too
--
*NL*
*NL*
HE
:
I
'm
afraid
of
you
.
I
'm
always
afraid
of
a
girl
--
until
I
've
kissed
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
SHE
:
-LRB-
Emphatically
-RRB-
My
dear
boy
,
the
war
is
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
HE
:
So
I
'll
always
be
afraid
of
you
.
*NL*
*NL*
SHE
:
-LRB-
Rather
sadly
-RRB-
I
suppose
you
will
.
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
A
slight
hesitation
on
both
their
parts
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
HE
:
-LRB-
After
due
consideration
-RRB-
Listen
.
This
is
a
frightful
thing
to
ask
.
*NL*
*NL*
SHE
:
-LRB-
Knowing
what
's
coming
-RRB-
After
five
minutes
.
*NL*
*NL*
HE
:
But
will
you
--
kiss
me
?
Or
are
you
afraid
?
*NL*
*NL*
SHE
:
I
'm
never
afraid
--
but
your
reasons
are
so
poor
.
*NL*
*NL*
HE
:
Rosalind
,
I
really
_
want
_
to
kiss
you
.
*NL*
*NL*
SHE
:
So
do
I.
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
They
kiss
--
definitely
and
thoroughly

-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
HE
:
-LRB-
After
a
breathless
second
-RRB-
Well
,
is
your
curiosity
satisfied
?
*NL*
*NL*
SHE
:
Is
yours

*NL*
*NL*
HE
:
No
,
it
's
only
aroused
.
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
He
looks
it
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
SHE
:
-LRB-
Dreamily
-RRB-
I
've
kissed
dozens
of
men
.
I
suppose
I
'll
kiss
dozens
*NL*
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
HE
:
-LRB-
Abstractedly
-RRB-
Yes
,
I
suppose
you
could
--
like
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
SHE
:
Most
people
like
the
way
I
kiss
.
*NL*
*NL*
HE
:
-LRB-
Remembering
himself
-RRB-
Good
Lord
,
yes
.
Kiss
me
once
more
,
Rosalind
.
*NL*
*NL*
SHE
:
No
--
my
curiosity
is
generally
satisfied
at
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
HE
:
-LRB-
Discouraged
-RRB-
Is
that
a
rule
?
*NL*
*NL*
SHE
:
I
make
rules
to
fit
the
cases
.
*NL*
*NL*
HE
:
You
and
I
are
somewhat
alike
--
except
that
I
'm
years
older
in
*NL*
experience
.
*NL*
*NL*
SHE
:
How
old
are
you
?
*NL*
*NL*
HE
:
Almost
twenty-three
.
You
?
*NL*
*NL*
SHE
:
Nineteen
--
just
.
*NL*
*NL*
HE
:
I
suppose
you
're
the
product
of
a
fashionable
school
.
*NL*
*NL*
SHE
:
No
--
I
'm
fairly
raw
material
.
I
was
expelled
from
Spence
--
I
've
*NL*
forgotten
why
.
*NL*
*NL*
HE
:
What
's
your
general
trend
?
*NL*
*NL*
SHE
:
Oh
,
I
'm
bright
,
quite
selfish
,
emotional
when
aroused
,
fond
of
*NL*
admiration
--
*NL*
*NL*
HE
:
-LRB-
Suddenly
-RRB-
I
do
n't
want
to
fall
in
love
with
you
--
*NL*
*NL*
SHE
:
-LRB-
Raising
her
eyebrows
-RRB-
Nobody
asked
you
to
.
*NL*
*NL*
HE
:
-LRB-
Continuing
coldly
-RRB-
But
I
probably
will
.
I
love
your
mouth
.
*NL*
*NL*
SHE
:
Hush
!
Please
do
n't
fall
in
love
with
my
mouth
--
hair
,
eyes
,
*NL*
shoulders
,
slippers
--
but
_
not
_
my
mouth
.
Everybody
falls
in
love
with
my
*NL*
mouth
.
*NL*
*NL*
HE
:
It
's
quite
beautiful
.
*NL*
*NL*
SHE
:
It
's
too
small
.
*NL*
*NL*
HE
:
No
it
is
n't
--
let
's
see
.
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
He
kisses
her
again
with
the
same
thoroughness
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
SHE
:
-LRB-
Rather
moved
-RRB-
Say
something
sweet
.
*NL*
*NL*
HE
:
-LRB-
Frightened
-RRB-
Lord
help
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
SHE
:
-LRB-
Drawing
away
-RRB-
Well
,
do
n't
--
if
it
's
so
hard
.
*NL*
*NL*
HE
:
Shall
we
pretend
?
So
soon
?
*NL*
*NL*
SHE
:
We
have
n't
the
same
standards
of
time
as
other
people
.
*NL*
*NL*
HE
:
Already
it
's
--
other
people
.
*NL*
*NL*
SHE
:
Let
's
pretend
.
*NL*
*NL*
HE
:
No
--
I
ca
n't
--
it
's
sentiment
.
*NL*
*NL*
SHE
:
You
're
not
sentimental
?
*NL*
*NL*
HE
:
No
,
I
'm
romantic
--
a
sentimental
person
thinks
things
will
last
--
a
*NL*
romantic
person
hopes
against
hope
that
they
wo
n't
.
Sentiment
is
*NL*
emotional
.
*NL*
*NL*
SHE
:
And
you
're
not
?
-LRB-
With
her
eyes
half-closed
.
-RRB-
You
probably
flatter
*NL*
yourself
that
that
's
a
superior
attitude
.
*NL*
*NL*
HE
:
Well
--
Rosalind
,
Rosalind
,
do
n't
argue
--
kiss
me
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
SHE
:
-LRB-
Quite
chilly
now
-RRB-
No
--
I
have
no
desire
to
kiss
you
.
*NL*
*NL*
HE
:
-LRB-
Openly
taken
aback
-RRB-
You
wanted
to
kiss
me
a
minute
ago
.
*NL*
*NL*
SHE
:
This
is
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
HE
:
I
'd
better
go
.
*NL*
*NL*
SHE
:
I
suppose
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
He
goes
toward
the
door
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
SHE
:
Oh
!
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
He
turns
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
SHE
:
-LRB-
Laughing
-RRB-
Score
--
Home
Team
:
One
hundred
--
Opponents
:
Zero
.
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
He
starts
back
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
SHE
:
-LRB-
Quickly
-RRB-
Rain
--
no
game
.
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
He
goes
out
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
She
goes
quietly
to
the
chiffonier
,
takes
out
a
cigarette-case
and
*NL*
hides
it
in
the
side
drawer
of
a
desk
.
Her
mother
enters
,
note-book
in
*NL*
hand
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
MRS.
CONNAGE
:
Good
--
I
've
been
wanting
to
speak
to
you
alone
before
we
go
*NL*
down-stairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
ROSALIND
:
Heavens
!
you
frighten
me
!
*NL*
*NL*
MRS.
CONNAGE
:
Rosalind
,
you
've
been
a
very
expensive
proposition
.
*NL*
*NL*
ROSALIND
:
-LRB-
Resignedly
-RRB-
Yes
.
*NL*
*NL*
MRS.
CONNAGE
:
And
you
know
your
father
has
n't
what
he
once
had
.
*NL*
*NL*
ROSALIND
:
-LRB-
Making
a
wry
face
-RRB-
Oh
,
please
do
n't
talk
about
money
.
*NL*
*NL*
MRS.
CONNAGE
:
You
ca
n't
do
anything
without
it
.
This
is
our
last
year
in
*NL*
this
house
--
and
unless
things
change
Cecelia
wo
n't
have
the
advantages
*NL*
you
've
had
.
*NL*
*NL*
ROSALIND
:
-LRB-
Impatiently
-RRB-
Well
--
what
is
it
?
*NL*
*NL*
MRS.
CONNAGE
:
So
I
ask
you
to
please
mind
me
in
several
things
I
've
put
*NL*
down
in
my
note-book
.
The
first
one
is
:
do
n't
disappear
with
young
men
.
*NL*
There
may
be
a
time
when
it
's
valuable
,
but
at
present
I
want
you
on
the
*NL*
dance-floor
where
I
can
find
you
.
There
are
certain
men
I
want
to
have
*NL*
you
meet
and
I
do
n't
like
finding
you
in
some
corner
of
the
conservatory
*NL*
exchanging
silliness
with
any
one
--
or
listening
to
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
ROSALIND
:
-LRB-
Sarcastically
-RRB-
Yes
,
listening
to
it
_
is
_
better
.
*NL*
*NL*
MRS.
CONNAGE
:
And
do
n't
waste
a
lot
of
time
with
the
college
set
--
little
*NL*
boys
nineteen
and
twenty
years
old
.
I
do
n't
mind
a
prom
or
a
football
*NL*
game
,
but
staying
away
from
advantageous
parties
to
eat
in
little
cafes
*NL*
down-town
with
Tom
,
Dick
,
and
Harry
--
*NL*
*NL*
ROSALIND
:
-LRB-
Offering
her
code
,
which
is
,
in
its
way
,
quite
as
high
as
her
*NL*
mother
's
-RRB-
Mother
,
it
's
done
--
you
ca
n't
run
everything
now
the
way
you
*NL*
did
in
the
early
nineties
.
*NL*
*NL*
MRS.
CONNAGE
:
-LRB-
Paying
no
attention
-RRB-
There
are
several
bachelor
friends
*NL*
of
your
father
's
that
I
want
you
to
meet
to-night
--
youngish
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
ROSALIND
:
-LRB-
Nodding
wisely
-RRB-
About
forty-five
?
*NL*
*NL*
MRS.
CONNAGE
:
-LRB-
Sharply
-RRB-
Why
not
?
*NL*
*NL*
ROSALIND
:
Oh
,
_
quite
_
all
right
--
they
know
life
and
are
so
adorably
*NL*
tired
looking
-LRB-
shakes
her
head
-RRB-
--
but
they
_
will
_
dance
.
*NL*
*NL*
MRS.
CONNAGE
:
I
have
n't
met
Mr.
Blaine
--
but
I
do
n't
think
you
'll
care
*NL*
for
him
.
He
does
n't
sound
like
a
money-maker
.
*NL*
*NL*
ROSALIND
:
Mother
,
I
never
_
think
_
about
money
.
*NL*
*NL*
MRS.
CONNAGE
:
You
never
keep
it
long
enough
to
think
about
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
ROSALIND
:
-LRB-
Sighs
-RRB-
Yes
,
I
suppose
some
day
I
'll
marry
a
ton
of
it
--
out
of
*NL*
sheer
boredom
.
*NL*
*NL*
MRS.
CONNAGE
:
-LRB-
Referring
to
note-book
-RRB-
I
had
a
wire
from
Hartford
.
*NL*
Dawson
Ryder
is
coming
up
.
Now
there
's
a
young
man
I
like
,
and
he
's
*NL*
floating
in
money
.
It
seems
to
me
that
since
you
seem
tired
of
Howard
*NL*
Gillespie
you
might
give
Mr.
Ryder
some
encouragement
.
This
is
the
third
*NL*
time
he
's
been
up
in
a
month
.
*NL*
*NL*
ROSALIND
:
How
did
you
know
I
was
tired
of
Howard
Gillespie
?
*NL*
*NL*
MRS.
CONNAGE
:
The
poor
boy
looks
so
miserable
every
time
he
comes
.
*NL*
*NL*
ROSALIND
:
That
was
one
of
those
romantic
,
pre-battle
affairs
.
They
're
*NL*
all
wrong
.
*NL*
*NL*
MRS.
CONNAGE
:
-LRB-
Her
say
said
-RRB-
At
any
rate
,
make
us
proud
of
you
to-night
.
*NL*
*NL*
ROSALIND
:
Do
n't
you
think
I
'm
beautiful
?
*NL*
*NL*
MRS.
CONNAGE
:
You
know
you
are
.
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
From
down-stairs
is
heard
the
moan
of
a
violin
being
tuned
,
the
roll
of
*NL*
a
drum
.
MRS.
CONNAGE
turns
quickly
to
her
daughter
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
MRS.
CONNAGE
:
Come
!
*NL*
*NL*
ROSALIND
:
One
minute
!
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
Her
mother
leaves
.
ROSALIND
goes
to
the
glass
where
she
gazes
at
*NL*
herself
with
great
satisfaction
.
She
kisses
her
hand
and
touches
her
*NL*
mirrored
mouth
with
it
.
Then
she
turns
out
the
lights
and
leaves
the
*NL*
room
.
Silence
for
a
moment
.
A
few
chords
from
the
piano
,
the
discreet
*NL*
patter
of
faint
drums
,
the
rustle
of
new
silk
,
all
blend
on
the
*NL*
staircase
outside
and
drift
in
through
the
partly
opened
door
.
Bundled
*NL*
figures
pass
in
the
lighted
hall
.
The
laughter
heard
below
becomes
*NL*
doubled
and
multiplied
.
Then
some
one
comes
in
,
closes
the
door
,
and
*NL*
switches
on
the
lights
.
It
is
CECELIA
.
She
goes
to
the
chiffonier
,
*NL*
looks
in
the
drawers
,
hesitates
--
then
to
the
desk
whence
she
takes
the
*NL*
cigarette-case
and
extracts
one
.
She
lights
it
and
then
,
puffing
and
*NL*
blowing
,
walks
toward
the
mirror
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
CECELIA
:
-LRB-
In
tremendously
sophisticated
accents
-RRB-
Oh
,
yes
,
coming
out
*NL*
is
_
such
_
a
farce
nowadays
,
you
know
.
One
really
plays
around
so
much
*NL*
before
one
is
seventeen
,
that
it
's
positively
anticlimax
.
-LRB-
Shaking
hands
*NL*
with
a
visionary
middle-aged
nobleman
.
-RRB-
Yes
,
your
grace
--
I
b
`
lieve
*NL*
I
've
heard
my
sister
speak
of
you
.
Have
a
puff
--
they
're
very
good
.
*NL*
They
're
--
they
're
Coronas
.
You
do
n't
smoke
?
What
a
pity
!
The
king
does
n't
*NL*
allow
it
,
I
suppose
.
Yes
,
I
'll
dance
.
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
So
she
dances
around
the
room
to
a
tune
from
down-stairs
,
her
arms
*NL*
outstretched
to
an
imaginary
partner
,
the
cigarette
waving
in
her
hand
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
*****
*NL*
*NL*
SEVERAL
HOURS
LATER
*NL*
*NL*
The
corner
of
a
den
down-stairs
,
filled
by
a
very
comfortable
leather
*NL*
lounge
.
A
small
light
is
on
each
side
above
,
and
in
the
middle
,
over
the
*NL*
couch
hangs
a
painting
of
a
very
old
,
very
dignified
gentleman
,
period
*NL*
1860
.
Outside
the
music
is
heard
in
a
fox-trot
.
*NL*
*NL*
ROSALIND
is
seated
on
the
lounge
and
on
her
left
is
HOWARD
GILLESPIE
,
a
*NL*
vapid
youth
of
about
twenty-four
.
He
is
obviously
very
unhappy
,
and
she
*NL*
is
quite
bored
.
*NL*
*NL*
GILLESPIE
:
-LRB-
Feebly
-RRB-
What
do
you
mean
I
've
changed
.
I
feel
the
same
*NL*
toward
you
.
*NL*
*NL*
ROSALIND
:
But
you
do
n't
look
the
same
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
GILLESPIE
:
Three
weeks
ago
you
used
to
say
that
you
liked
me
because
I
*NL*
was
so
blase
,
so
indifferent
--
I
still
am
.
*NL*
*NL*
ROSALIND
:
But
not
about
me
.
I
used
to
like
you
because
you
had
brown
*NL*
eyes
and
thin
legs
.
*NL*
*NL*
GILLESPIE
:
-LRB-
Helplessly
-RRB-
They
're
still
thin
and
brown
.
You
're
a
vampire
,
*NL*
that
's
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
ROSALIND
:
The
only
thing
I
know
about
vamping
is
what
's
on
the
piano
*NL*
score
.
What
confuses
men
is
that
I
'm
perfectly
natural
.
I
used
to
think
*NL*
you
were
never
jealous
.
Now
you
follow
me
with
your
eyes
wherever
I
go
.
*NL*
*NL*
GILLESPIE
:
I
love
you
.
*NL*
*NL*
ROSALIND
:
-LRB-
Coldly
-RRB-
I
know
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
GILLESPIE
:
And
you
have
n't
kissed
me
for
two
weeks
.
I
had
an
idea
that
*NL*
after
a
girl
was
kissed
she
was
--
was
--
won
.
*NL*
*NL*
ROSALIND
:
Those
days
are
over
.
I
have
to
be
won
all
over
again
every
*NL*
time
you
see
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
GILLESPIE
:
Are
you
serious
?
*NL*
*NL*
ROSALIND
:
About
as
usual
.
There
used
to
be
two
kinds
of
kisses
:
First
*NL*
when
girls
were
kissed
and
deserted
;
second
,
when
they
were
engaged
.
Now
*NL*
there
's
a
third
kind
,
where
the
man
is
kissed
and
deserted
.
If
Mr.
*NL*
Jones
of
the
nineties
bragged
he
'd
kissed
a
girl
,
every
one
knew
he
was
*NL*
through
with
her
.
If
Mr.
Jones
of
1919
brags
the
same
every
one
knows
*NL*
it
's
because
he
ca
n't
kiss
her
any
more
.
Given
a
decent
start
any
girl
*NL*
can
beat
a
man
nowadays
.
*NL*
*NL*
GILLESPIE
:
Then
why
do
you
play
with
men
?
*NL*
*NL*
ROSALIND
:
-LRB-
Leaning
forward
confidentially
-RRB-
For
that
first
moment
,
when
*NL*
he
's
interested
.
There
is
a
moment
--
Oh
,
just
before
the
first
kiss
,
a
*NL*
whispered
word
--
something
that
makes
it
worth
while
.
*NL*
*NL*
GILLESPIE
:
And
then
?
*NL*
*NL*
ROSALIND

Then
after
that
you
make
him
talk
about
himself

Pretty
soon
*NL*
he
thinks
of
nothing
but
being
alone
with
you

he
sulks

does

RYDER

twenty-six

handsome

steady
and
sure
of
success

my

*NL*
ROSALIND

Well

Dawson

so
you
recognize
me

Now
I
know

Your

ROSALIND

Is
it

I
have
n't
seen
it
lately

I
'm
weary

Do
you
mind
*NL*
sitting
out
a
minute
?
*NL*
*NL*
RYDER
:
Mind
--
I
'm
delighted
.
You
know
I
loathe
this
``
rushing

idea

See
a

to-morrow

ROSALIND

Startled

What

Oh

you
know
you
're
remarkable
!
*NL*
*NL*
ROSALIND
:
Because
you
know
I
'm
an
awful
proposition
.
Any
one
who
marries
*NL*
me
will
have
his
hands
full
.
I
'm
mean

mighty
mean

RYDER

Oh

I

Oh

Come

I

There

no

ALEC

Thoughtfully

want
Amory

*NL*
*NL*
CECELIA
:
Why

I
had
an
idea
that
that
was
just
what
you
did
want
.
*NL*
*NL*
ALEC
:
I
did
,
but
since
seeing
these
girls

I
do
n't
know

I
'm
awfully
*NL*
attached
to
Amory

He
's
sensitive
and
I
do
n't
want
him
to
break
his
*NL*
heart
over
somebody
who
does
n't
care
about
him

*NL*
CECELIA

He
's
very
good
looking

*NL*
*NL*
ALEC

-LRB-
Still
thoughtfully
-RRB-
She
wo
n't
marry
him
,
but
a

does
n't
have
*NL*
to
marry
a
man
to
break
his
heart

*NL*
*NL*
CECELIA

What
does
it
?
I
wish
I
knew
the
secret

*NL*
*NL*
ALEC
:
Why

you
cold-blooded

It

Of

you

She

naturally
be

*NL*
MRS.
CONNAGE
:
Her
father
has
marshalled
eight
bachelor
millionaires
to

meet
her

ALEC
:
You
might
form
a

march
through

*NL*
*NL*
MRS.
CONNAGE

I
'm
perfectly
serious

I

she

Cocoanut

some

Oh

It
's

the

n't
it

*NL*
*NL*
AMORY
:
-LRB-
Spicily
-RRB-
Approximately
.
But
I
always
felt
that
I
'd
rather
be
*NL*
provincial
hot-tamale
than
soup
without
seasoning

*NL*

GILLESPIE

What

AMORY

Oh

no

*NL*
AMORY

I
was
in

*NL*
ROSALIND

So
?
*NL*
*NL*
AMORY
:
Oh
,
yes

her
name
was
Isabelle

nothing
at
all
to
her
except
what
*NL*
I
read
into
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
ROSALIND
:
What
happened
?
*NL*
*NL*
AMORY
:
Finally
I
convinced
her
that
she
was
smarter
than
I
was
--
then
she
*NL*
threw
me
over
.
Said
I
was
critical
and
impractical
,
you
know
.
*NL*
*NL*
ROSALIND
:
What
do
you
mean
impractical

*NL*
*NL*
AMORY

Oh

a

ca
n't
change
a

*NL*
ROSALIND

What
are

AMORY

Ca

run
for
President

*NL*
*NL*
ROSALIND

Greenwich
Village

*NL*
*NL*
AMORY

Good

no

I
said
write

not

*NL*
*NL*
ROSALIND

I
like
business

Clever

ROSALIND

Oh

are
you
going
to
commence
the
``

*NL*
*NL*
AMORY
:
No

I
was
going

make
it
French

I
was
Louis

you
were

one

suggested
pretending

*NL*
*NL*
AMORY

If
we
did
it
would
be
very
big
.
*NL*
*NL*
ROSALIND
:
Why

*NL*
*NL*
AMORY
:
Because
selfish
people
are
in
a

terribly
capable
of
great

loves

Not

ROSALIND

Sadly

Oh

only
I
want

real

and
I
never

I
never
find

I
loathe

It

gratify

Some

opened

She
pauses

in

odd
burst
of
prophecy

adds

KISMET
*NL*
*NL*
Within
two
weeks
Amory
and
Rosalind
were
deeply
and
passionately
in
*NL*
love
.
The
critical
qualities
which
had
spoiled
for
each
of
them
a
dozen
*NL*
romances
were
dulled
by
the
great
wave
of
emotion
that
washed
over
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
may
be
an
insane
love-affair
,
''
she
told
her
anxious
mother
,
``
but
*NL*
it
's
not
inane
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
wave
swept
Amory
into
an
advertising
agency
early
in
March
,
where
*NL*
he
alternated
between
astonishing
bursts
of
rather
exceptional
work
and
*NL*
wild
dreams
of
becoming
suddenly
rich
and
touring
Italy
with
Rosalind
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
together
constantly
,
for
lunch
,
for
dinner
,
and
nearly
every
*NL*
evening
--
always
in
a
sort
of
breathless
hush
,
as
if
they
feared
that
any
*NL*
minute
the
spell
would
break
and
drop
them
out
of
this
paradise
of
rose
*NL*
and
flame
.
But
the
spell
became
a
trance
,
seemed
to
increase
from
day
*NL*
to
day
;
they
began
to
talk
of
marrying
in
July
--
in
June
.
All
life
was
*NL*
transmitted
into
terms
of
their
love
,
all
experience
,
all
desires
,
all
*NL*
ambitions
,
were
nullified
--
their
senses
of
humor
crawled
into
corners
to
*NL*
sleep
;
their
former
love-affairs
seemed
faintly
laughable
and
scarcely
*NL*
regretted
juvenalia
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
the
second
time
in
his
life
Amory
had
had
a
complete
bouleversement
*NL*
and
was
hurrying
into
line
with
his
generation
.
*NL*
*NL*
*****
*NL*
*NL*
A
LITTLE
INTERLUDE
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
wandered
slowly
up
the
avenue
and
thought
of
the
night
as
*NL*
inevitably
his
--
the
pageantry
and
carnival
of
rich
dusk
and
dim
streets
*NL*
...
it
seemed
that
he
had
closed
the
book
of
fading
harmonies
at
last
*NL*
and
stepped
into
the
sensuous
vibrant
walks
of
life
.
Everywhere
these
*NL*
countless
lights
,
this
promise
of
a
night
of
streets
and
singing
--
he
*NL*
moved
in
a
half-dream
through
the
crowd
as
if
expecting
to
meet
Rosalind
*NL*
hurrying
toward
him
with
eager
feet
from
every
corner
...
How
the
*NL*
unforgettable
faces
of
dusk
would
blend
to
her
,
the
myriad
footsteps
,
*NL*
a
thousand
overtures
,
would
blend
to
her
footsteps
;
and
there
would
be
*NL*
more
drunkenness
than
wine
in
the
softness
of
her
eyes
on
his
.
Even
*NL*
his
dreams
now
were
faint
violins
drifting
like
summer
sounds
upon
the
*NL*
summer
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
room
was
in
darkness
except
for
the
faint
glow
of
Tom
's
cigarette
*NL*
where
he
lounged
by
the
open
window
.
As
the
door
shut
behind
him
,
Amory
*NL*
stood
a
moment
with
his
back
against
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hello
,
Benvenuto
Blaine
.
How
went
the
advertising
business
to-day
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
sprawled
on
a
couch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
loathed
it
as
usual
!
''
The
momentary
vision
of
the
bustling
agency
was
*NL*
displaced
quickly
by
another
picture
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
God
!
She
's
wonderful
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
sighed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
tell
you
,
''
repeated
Amory
,
``
just
how
wonderful
she
is
.
I
do
n't
*NL*
want
you
to
know
.
I
do
n't
want
any
one
to
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Another
sigh
came
from
the
window
--
quite
a
resigned
sigh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
life
and
hope
and
happiness
,
my
whole
world
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
felt
the
quiver
of
a
tear
on
his
eyelid
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
_
Golly
_
,
Tom
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
*****
*NL*
*NL*
BITTER
SWEET
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sit
like
we
do
,
''
she
whispered
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
sat
in
the
big
chair
and
held
out
his
arms
so
that
she
could
nestle
*NL*
inside
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
knew
you

she
said
softly
,
``
like
summer

just
when
I
*NL*
needed
you
most

darling

darling

*NL*
*NL*
His
lips
moved
lazily
over
her
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
_
taste
_
so
good
,
''
he
sighed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
mean
,
lover
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

just
sweet

just
sweet

he
held
her
closer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Amory

she
whispered
,
``
when
you
're
ready
for
me
I
'll
marry
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
We
wo
n't
have
much
at
first

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
!
''
she
cried
.
``
It
hurts
when
you
reproach
yourself
for
what
you
*NL*
ca
n't
give
me
.
I
've
got
your
precious
self

and
that
's
enough
for
me

*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell

*NL*
*NL*

You

Oh

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

I

I

Always

you

*NL*
*NL*
``
All

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
to
belong
to
you

I
want
your

to
be
my

I
want

have
your

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
have

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do

Just

*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

you

so
much
a

so

all

*NL*
*NL*
He
closed
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
so
happy
that
I
'm
frightened

Would
n't
it
be
awful
if
this
was

was
*NL*
the
high
point
?

*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
at
him
dreamily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Beauty
and
love
pass
,
I
know
...
Oh
,
there
's
sadness
,
too
.
I
suppose
*NL*
all
great
happiness
is
a
little
sad
.
Beauty
means
the
scent
of
roses
and
*NL*
then
the
death
of
roses
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Beauty
means
the
agony
of
sacrifice
and
the
end
of
agony

*NL*
*NL*
``
And

Amory

we

I

sure
God
loves
us

He
loves
you

You
're

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
his

I
'm
yours

Amory

I
belong

you

For
the
first
time
I
*NL*
regret
all
the
other
kisses
;
now
I
know
how
much
a
kiss
can
mean
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
they
would
smoke
and
he
would
tell
her
about
his
day
at
the
*NL*
office
--
and
where
they
might
live
.
Sometimes
,
when
he
was
particularly
*NL*
loquacious
,
she
went
to
sleep
in
his
arms
,
but
he
loved
that
*NL*
Rosalind
--
all
Rosalinds
--
as
he
had
never
in
the
world
loved
any
one
*NL*
else
.
Intangibly
fleeting
,
unrememberable
hours

*NL*
*NL*
AQUATIC
INCIDENT
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
Amory
and
Howard
Gillespie
meeting
by
accident
down-town
took
*NL*
lunch
together
,
and
Amory
heard
a
story
that
delighted
him
.
Gillespie
*NL*
after
several
cocktails
was
in
a
talkative
mood
;
he
began
by
telling
*NL*
Amory
that
he
was
sure
Rosalind
was
slightly
eccentric
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
gone
with
her
on
a
swimming
party
up
in
Westchester
County
,
and
*NL*
some
one
mentioned
that
Annette
Kellerman
had
been
there
one
day
on
a
*NL*
visit
and
had
dived
from
the
top
of
a
rickety
,
thirty-foot
summer-house
.
*NL*
Immediately
Rosalind
insisted
that
Howard
should
climb
up
with
her
to
*NL*
see
what
it
looked
like
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
minute
later
,
as
he
sat
and
dangled
his
feet
on
the
edge
,
a
form
shot
*NL*
by
him
;
Rosalind
,
her
arms
spread
in
a
beautiful
swan
dive
,
had
sailed
*NL*
through
the
air
into
the
clear
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
_
I
_
had
to
go
,
after
that
--
and
I
nearly
killed
myself
.
I
*NL*
thought
I
was
pretty
good
to
even
try
it
.
Nobody
else
in
the
party
tried
*NL*
it
.
Well
,
afterward
Rosalind
had
the
nerve
to
ask
me
why
I
stooped
over
*NL*
when
I
dove
.
`
It
did
n't
make
it
any
easier
,
'
she
said
,
`
it
just
took
all
*NL*
the
courage
out
of
it
.
'
I
ask
you
,
what
can
a
man
do
with
a
girl
like
*NL*
that
?
Unnecessary
,
I
call
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gillespie
failed
to
understand
why
Amory
was
smiling
delightedly
all
*NL*
through
lunch
.
He
thought
perhaps
he
was
one
of
these
hollow
optimists
.

FIVE
WEEKS
LATER
*NL*
*NL*
Again
the
library
of
the
Connage
house
.
ROSALIND
is
alone
,
sitting
*NL*
on
the
lounge
staring
very
moodily
and
unhappily
at
nothing
.
She
has
*NL*
changed
perceptibly
--
she
is
a
trifle
thinner
for
one
thing
;
the
light
in
*NL*
her
eyes
is
not
so
bright
;
she
looks
easily
a
year
older
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
mother
comes
in
,
muffled
in
an
opera-cloak
.
She
takes
in
ROSALIND
*NL*
with
a
nervous
glance
.
*NL*
*NL*
MRS.
CONNAGE
:
Who
is
coming
to-night
?
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
ROSALIND
fails
to
hear
her
,
at
least
takes
no
notice
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
MRS.
CONNAGE
:
Alec
is
coming
up
to
take
me
to
this
Barrie
play
,
``
Et
tu
,
*NL*
Brutus
.
''
-LRB-
She
perceives
that
she
is
talking
to
herself
.
-RRB-
Rosalind
!
I
*NL*
asked
you
who
is
coming
to-night
?
*NL*
*NL*
ROSALIND
:
-LRB-
Starting
-RRB-
Oh
--
what
--
oh
--
Amory
--
*NL*
*NL*
MRS.
CONNAGE
:
-LRB-
Sarcastically
-RRB-
You
have
so
_
many
_
admirers
lately
that
I
*NL*
could
n't
imagine
_
which
_
one
.
-LRB-
ROSALIND
does
n't
answer
.
-RRB-
Dawson
Ryder
*NL*
is
more
patient
than
I
thought
he
'd
be
.
You
have
n't
given
him
an
evening
*NL*
this
week
.
*NL*
*NL*
ROSALIND
:
-LRB-
With
a
very
weary
expression
that
is
quite
new
to
her
face
.
-RRB-
*NL*
Mother
--
please
--
*NL*
*NL*
MRS.
CONNAGE
:
Oh
,
_
I
_
wo
n't
interfere
.
You
've
already
wasted
over
two
*NL*
months
on
a
theoretical
genius
who
has
n't
a
penny
to
his
name
,
but
_
go
_
*NL*
ahead
,
waste
your
life
on
him
.
_
I
_
wo
n't
interfere
.
*NL*
*NL*
ROSALIND
:
-LRB-
As
if
repeating
a
tiresome
lesson
-RRB-
You
know
he
has
a
*NL*
little
income
--
and
you
know
he
's
earning
thirty-five
dollars
a
week
in
*NL*
advertising
--
*NL*
*NL*
MRS.
CONNAGE
:
And
it
would
n't
buy
your
clothes
.
-LRB-
She
pauses
but
ROSALIND
*NL*
makes
no
reply
.
-RRB-
I
have
your
best
interests
at
heart
when
I
tell
you
not
*NL*
to
take
a
step
you
'll
spend
your
days
regretting
.
It
's
not
as
if
your
*NL*
father
could
help
you
.
Things
have
been
hard
for
him
lately
and
he
's
an
*NL*
old
man
.
You
'd
be
dependent
absolutely
on
a
dreamer
,
a
nice
,
well-born
*NL*
boy
,
but
a
dreamer
--
merely
_
clever
_
.
-LRB-
She
implies
that
this
quality
in
*NL*
itself
is
rather
vicious
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
ROSALIND
:
For
heaven
's
sake
,
mother
--
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
A
maid
appears
,
announces
Mr.
Blaine
who
follows
immediately
.
AMORY
'S
*NL*
friends
have
been
telling
him
for
ten
days
that
he
``
looks
like
the
wrath
*NL*
of
God
,
''
and
he
does
.
As
a
matter
of
fact
he
has
not
been
able
to
eat
a
*NL*
mouthful
in
the
last
thirty-six
hours
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
AMORY
:
Good
evening
,
Mrs.
Connage
.
*NL*
*NL*
MRS.
CONNAGE
:
-LRB-
Not
unkindly
-RRB-
Good
evening
,
Amory
.
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
AMORY
and
ROSALIND
exchange
glances
--
and
ALEC
comes
in
.
ALEC
'S
attitude
*NL*
throughout
has
been
neutral
.
He
believes
in
his
heart
that
the
marriage
*NL*
would
make
AMORY
mediocre
and
ROSALIND
miserable
,
but
he
feels
a
great
*NL*
sympathy
for
both
of
them
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
ALEC
:
Hi
,
Amory
!
*NL*
*NL*
AMORY
:
Hi
,
Alec
!
Tom
said
he
'd
meet
you
at
the
theatre
.
*NL*
*NL*
ALEC
:
Yeah
,
just
saw
him
.
How
's
the
advertising
to-day
?
Write
some
*NL*
brilliant
copy
?
*NL*
*NL*
AMORY
:
Oh
,
it
's
about
the
same
.
I
got
a
raise
--
-LRB-
Every
one
looks
at
him
*NL*
rather
eagerly
-RRB-
--
of
two
dollars
a
week
.
-LRB-
General
collapse
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
MRS.
CONNAGE
:
Come
,
Alec
,
I
hear
the
car
.
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
A
good
night
,
rather
chilly
in
sections
.
After
MRS.
CONNAGE
and
ALEC
*NL*
go
out
there
is
a
pause
.
ROSALIND
still
stares
moodily
at
the
fireplace
.
*NL*
AMORY
goes
to
her
and
puts
his
arm
around
her
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
AMORY
:
Darling
girl
.
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
They
kiss
.
Another
pause
and
then
she
seizes
his
hand
,
covers
it
with
*NL*
kisses
and
holds
it
to
her
breast
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
ROSALIND
:
-LRB-
Sadly
-RRB-
I
love
your
hands
,
more
than
anything
.
I
see
them
*NL*
often
when
you
're
away
from
me
--
so
tired
;
I
know
every
line
of
them
.
*NL*
Dear
hands
!
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
Their
eyes
meet
for
a
second
and
then
she
begins
to
cry
--
a
tearless
*NL*
sobbing
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
AMORY
:
Rosalind
!
*NL*
*NL*
ROSALIND
:
Oh
,
we
're
so
darned
pitiful
!
*NL*
*NL*
AMORY
:
Rosalind
!
*NL*
*NL*
ROSALIND
:
Oh
,
I
want
to
die
!
*NL*
*NL*
AMORY
:
Rosalind
,
another
night
of
this
and
I
'll
go
to
pieces
.
You
've
*NL*
been
this
way
four
days
now
.
You
've
got
to
be
more
encouraging
or
I
*NL*
ca
n't
work
or
eat
or
sleep
.
-LRB-
He
looks
around
helplessly
as
if
searching
*NL*
for
new
words
to
clothe
an
old
,
shopworn
phrase
.
-RRB-
We
'll
have
to
make
a
*NL*
start
.
I
like
having
to
make
a
start
together
.
-LRB-
His
forced
hopefulness
*NL*
fades
as
he
sees
her
unresponsive
.
-RRB-
What
's
the
matter
?
-LRB-
He
gets
up
*NL*
suddenly
and
starts
to
pace
the
floor
.
-RRB-
It
's
Dawson
Ryder
,
that
's
what
*NL*
it
is
.
He
's
been
working
on
your
nerves
.
You
've
been
with
him
every
*NL*
afternoon
for
a
week
.
People
come
and
tell
me
they
've
seen
you
together
,
*NL*
and
I
have
to
smile
and
nod
and
pretend
it
has
n't
the
slightest
*NL*
significance
for
me
.
And
you
wo
n't
tell
me
anything
as
it
develops
.
*NL*
*NL*
ROSALIND
:
Amory
,
if
you
do
n't
sit
down
I
'll
scream
.
*NL*
*NL*
AMORY
:
-LRB-
Sitting
down
suddenly
beside
her
-RRB-
Oh

Lord

*NL*
*NL*
ROSALIND
:
-LRB-
Taking
his
hand
gently
-RRB-
You
know
I
love
you
,
do
n't
you
?
*NL*
*NL*
AMORY
:
Yes
.
*NL*
*NL*
ROSALIND
:
You
know
I
'll
always
love
you
--
*NL*
*NL*
AMORY
:
Do
n't
talk
that
way
;
you
frighten
me
.
It
sounds
as
if
we
were
n't
*NL*
going
to
have
each
other
.
-LRB-
She
cries
a
little
and
rising
from
the
couch
*NL*
goes
to
the
armchair
.
-RRB-
I
've
felt
all
afternoon
that
things
were
worse
.
*NL*
I
nearly
went
wild
down
at
the
office
--
could
n't
write
a
line
.
Tell
me
*NL*
everything
.
*NL*
*NL*
ROSALIND
:
There
's
nothing
to
tell
,
I
say

I
'm
just
nervous

*NL*
*NL*
AMORY
:
Rosalind

you
're
playing
with
the
idea
of
marrying
Dawson
Ryder

*NL*
*NL*
ROSALIND

-LRB-
After
a
pause
-RRB-
He
's
been
asking
me
to
all

*NL*
*NL*
AMORY
:
Well

's
got
his
nerve

*NL*
*NL*
ROSALIND

-LRB-
After
another
pause
-RRB-
I
like
him

*NL*
*NL*
AMORY
:
Do
n't
say
that

It
hurts
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
ROSALIND
:
Do
n't
be
a
silly
idiot

You
know
you
're

've
ever
*NL*
loved

ever
will
love

AMORY

get
married

next

ROSALIND

*NL*
AMORY
:
Why
not

*NL*
*NL*
ROSALIND
:
Oh

ca

I

be
your
squaw
--
in
some
horrible
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
AMORY

We
'll
have
two
hundred
and
seventy-five
dollars
a
month
all
told

*NL*
*NL*
ROSALIND

Darling

I

even

usually

*NL*
*NL*
AMORY

it
for

*NL*
ROSALIND

sob
-RRB-
Thanks

*NL*
*NL*
AMORY
:
Rosalind
,
you
_
ca
n't

be
thinking
of
marrying
some
one
else

Tell
*NL*
me

You
leave
me
in
the
dark

I
can
help
you
fight
it
out
if
you
'll
only
*NL*
tell
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
ROSALIND
:
It
's
just
--
us
.
We
're
pitiful
,
that
's
all
.
The
very
qualities
I
*NL*
love
you
for
are
the
ones
that
will
always
make
you
a
failure
.
*NL*
*NL*
AMORY
:
-LRB-
Grimly
-RRB-
Go
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
ROSALIND
:
Oh
--
it
_
is
_
Dawson
Ryder
.
He
's
so
reliable
,
I
almost
feel
that
*NL*
he
'd
be
a
--
a
background
.
*NL*
*NL*
AMORY
:
You
do
n't
love
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
ROSALIND
:
I
know
,
but
I
respect
him
,
and
he
's
a
good
man
and
a
strong
*NL*
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
AMORY
:
-LRB-
Grudgingly
-RRB-
Yes
--
he
's
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
ROSALIND
:
Well
--
here
's
one
little
thing
.
There
was
a
little
poor
boy
we
*NL*
met
in
Rye
Tuesday
afternoon
--
and
,
oh
,
Dawson
took
him
on
his
lap
*NL*
and
talked
to
him
and
promised
him
an
Indian
suit
--
and
next
day
he
*NL*
remembered
and
bought
it
--
and
,
oh
,
it
was
so
sweet
and
I
could
n't
help
*NL*
thinking
he
'd
be
so
nice
to
--
to
our
children
--
take
care
of
them
--
and
I
*NL*
would
n't
have
to
worry
.
*NL*
*NL*
AMORY
:
-LRB-
In
despair
-RRB-
Rosalind
!
Rosalind
!
*NL*
*NL*
ROSALIND
:
-LRB-
With
a
faint
roguishness
-RRB-
Do
n't
look
so
consciously
*NL*
suffering
.
*NL*
*NL*
AMORY
:
What
power
we
have
of
hurting
each
other
!
*NL*
*NL*
ROSALIND
:
-LRB-
Commencing
to
sob
again
-RRB-
It
's
been
so
perfect
--
you
and
I
.
So
*NL*
like
a
dream
that
I
'd
longed
for
and
never
thought
I
'd
find
.
The
first
*NL*
real
unselfishness
I
've
ever
felt
in
my
life
.
And
I
ca
n't
see
it
fade
*NL*
out
in
a
colorless
atmosphere
!
*NL*
*NL*
AMORY
:
It
wo
n't
--
it
wo
n't
!
*NL*
*NL*
ROSALIND
:
I
'd
rather
keep
it
as
a
beautiful
memory
--
tucked
away
in
my
*NL*
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
AMORY
:
Yes
,
women
can
do
that
--
but
not
men
.
I
'd
remember
always
,
not
*NL*
the
beauty
of
it
while
it
lasted
,
but
just
the
bitterness
,
the
long
*NL*
bitterness
.
*NL*
*NL*
ROSALIND
:
Do
n't
!
*NL*
*NL*
AMORY
:
All
the
years
never
to
see
you
,
never
to
kiss
you
,
just
a
gate
*NL*
shut
and
barred
--
you
do
n't
dare
be
my
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
ROSALIND
:
No
--
no
--
I
'm
taking
the
hardest
course
,
the
strongest
course
.
*NL*
Marrying
you
would
be
a
failure
and
I
never
fail
--
if
you
do
n't
stop
*NL*
walking
up
and
down
I
'll
scream
!
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
Again
he
sinks
despairingly
onto
the
lounge
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
AMORY
:
Come
over
here
and
kiss
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
ROSALIND
:
No
.
*NL*
*NL*
AMORY
:
Do
n't
you
_
want
_
to
kiss
me
?
*NL*
*NL*
ROSALIND
:
To-night
I
want
you
to
love
me
calmly
and
coolly
.
*NL*
*NL*
AMORY
:
The
beginning
of
the
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
ROSALIND
:
-LRB-
With
a
burst
of
insight
-RRB-
Amory
,
you
're
young
.
I
'm
young
.
*NL*
People
excuse
us
now
for
our
poses
and
vanities
,
for
treating
people
*NL*
like
Sancho
and
yet
getting
away
with
it
.
They
excuse
us
now
.
But
you
've
*NL*
got
a
lot
of
knocks
coming
to
you
--
*NL*
*NL*
AMORY
:
And
you
're
afraid
to
take
them
with
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
ROSALIND
:
No
,
not
that
.
There
was
a
poem
I
read
somewhere
--
you
'll
say
*NL*
Ella
Wheeler
Wilcox
and
laugh
--
but
listen
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
this

wisdom

to

*NL*
To

*NL*
To
ask
no
question
,
to
make
no
prayer

*NL*
To
kiss
the

and
caress
the

*NL*
Speed

*NL*
*NL*
AMORY

*NL*
*NL*
ROSALIND

Amory

I

yours

you

There
have
been
times
in
the
*NL*
last

I

been
completely
yours

But
I

AMORY

We

*NL*
ROSALIND

*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
AMORY
with
his
head
sunk
in
his

does
not
move
.
The
life
seems
*NL*
suddenly
gone
out
of
him
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
ROSALIND
:
Lover

Lover

I

I

*NL*
*NL*
AMORY
:
Rosalind
,
we
're
on
each

nerves

It
's
just
that
we
're
both
*NL*
high-strung
,
and
this
week
--
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
His
voice
is
curiously
old
.
She
crosses
to
him
and
taking
his
face
in
*NL*
her
hands
,
kisses
him
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
ROSALIND
:
I

Amory

I

be
shut
away
from
the
trees
and
*NL*
flowers
,
cooped
up
in
a
little
flat
,
waiting
for
you

You
'd
hate
me
in
a
*NL*
narrow
atmosphere

I

make
you
hate

*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
Again
she
is
blinded
by
sudden
uncontrolled
tears

-RRB-

*NL*
AMORY

Rosalind

*NL*
*NL*
ROSALIND

Oh

Do

it
harder

I
ca

stand
it

*NL*
*NL*
AMORY
:
-LRB-
His
face
drawn
,
his
voice
strained
-RRB-
Do
you
know
what
you
're
*NL*
saying
?
Do
you
mean
forever

*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
There
is
a
difference
somehow
in
the
quality
of
their
suffering

-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
ROSALIND
:
Ca

*NL*
*NL*
AMORY

I

You

two

years

knocks
with

ROSALIND

I

AMORY

A
little
hysterically
-RRB-

*NL*
I

*NL*
*NL*
ROSALIND
:
-LRB-
A
hard
note
in
her
voice
-RRB-
You
're
being
a
baby
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
AMORY
:
-LRB-
Wildly
-RRB-
I
do
n't
care
!
You
're
spoiling
our
lives

*NL*
*NL*
ROSALIND
:
I
'm
doing
the
wise
thing
,
the
only
thing
.
*NL*
*NL*
AMORY
:
Are
you
going
to
marry
Dawson
Ryder
?
*NL*
*NL*
ROSALIND
:
Oh
,
do
n't
ask
me
.
You
know
I
'm
old
in
some
ways
--
in
*NL*
others
--
well
,
I
'm
just
a
little
girl
.
I
like
sunshine
and
pretty
things
*NL*
and
cheerfulness
--
and
I
dread
responsibility
.
I
do
n't
want
to
think
*NL*
about
pots
and
kitchens
and
brooms
.
I
want
to
worry
whether
my
legs
will
*NL*
get
slick
and
brown
when
I
swim
in
the
summer
.
*NL*
*NL*
AMORY
:
And
you
love
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
ROSALIND
:
That
's
just
why
it
has
to
end
.
Drifting
hurts
too
much
.
We
*NL*
ca
n't
have
any
more
scenes
like
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
She
draws
his
ring
from
her
finger
and
hands
it
to
him
.
Their
eyes
*NL*
blind
again
with
tears
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
AMORY
:
-LRB-
His
lips
against
her
wet
cheek
-RRB-
Do
n't
!
Keep
it
,
please
--
oh
,
*NL*
do
n't
break
my
heart
!
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
She
presses
the
ring
softly
into
his
hand
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
ROSALIND
:
-LRB-
Brokenly
-RRB-
You
'd
better
go
.
*NL*
*NL*
AMORY
:
Good-by
--
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
She
looks
at
him
once
more
,
with
infinite
longing
,
infinite
sadness
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
ROSALIND
:
Do
n't
ever
forget
me
,
Amory
--
*NL*
*NL*
AMORY
:
Good-by
--
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
He
goes
to
the
door
,
fumbles
for
the
knob
,
finds
it
--
she
sees
him
throw
*NL*
back
his
head
--
and
he
is
gone
.
Gone
--
she
half
starts
from
the
lounge
and
*NL*
then
sinks
forward
on
her
face
into
the
pillows
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
ROSALIND
:
Oh
,
God
,
I
want
to
die
!
-LRB-
After
a
moment
she
rises
and
with
*NL*
her
eyes
closed
feels
her
way
to
the
door
.
Then
she
turns
and
looks
once
*NL*
more
at
the
room
.
Here
they
had
sat
and
dreamed
:
that
tray
she
had
so
*NL*
often
filled
with
matches
for
him
;
that
shade
that
they
had
discreetly
*NL*
lowered
one
long
Sunday
afternoon
.
Misty-eyed
she
stands
and
remembers
;
*NL*
she
speaks
aloud
.
-RRB-
Oh
,
Amory
,
what
have
I
done
to
you
?
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
And
deep
under
the
aching
sadness
that
will
pass
in
time
,
Rosalind
*NL*
feels
that
she
has
lost
something
,
she
knows
not
what
,
she
knows
not
*NL*
why
.

CHAPTER
2
.
Experiments
in
Convalescence
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
Knickerbocker
Bar
,
beamed
upon
by
Maxfield
Parrish
's
jovial
,
*NL*
colorful
``
Old
King
Cole
,
''
was
well
crowded
.
Amory
stopped
in
the
*NL*
entrance
and
looked
at
his
wrist-watch
;
he
wanted
particularly
to
know
*NL*
the
time
,
for
something
in
his
mind
that
catalogued
and
classified
liked
*NL*
to
chip
things
off
cleanly
.
Later
it
would
satisfy
him
in
a
vague
way
to
*NL*
be
able
to
think
``
that
thing
ended
at
exactly
twenty
minutes
after
eight
*NL*
on
Thursday
,
June
10
,
1919
.
''
This
was
allowing
for
the
walk
from
*NL*
her
house
--
a
walk
concerning
which
he
had
afterward
not
the
faintest
*NL*
recollection
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
in
rather
grotesque
condition
:
two
days
of
worry
and
nervousness
,
*NL*
of
sleepless
nights
,
of
untouched
meals
,
culminating
in
the
emotional
*NL*
crisis
and
Rosalind
's
abrupt
decision
--
the
strain
of
it
had
drugged
the
*NL*
foreground
of
his
mind
into
a
merciful
coma
.
As
he
fumbled
clumsily
with
*NL*
the
olives
at
the
free-lunch
table
,
a
man
approached
and
spoke
to
him
,
*NL*
and
the
olives
dropped
from
his
nervous
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Amory
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
some
one
he
had
known
at
Princeton
;
he
had
no
idea
of
the
name
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hello
,
old
boy
--
''
he
heard
himself
saying
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Name
's
Jim
Wilson
--
you
've
forgotten
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sure
,
you
bet
,
Jim
.
I
remember
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Going
to
reunion
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
!
''
Simultaneously
he
realized
that
he
was
not
going
to
reunion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Get
overseas
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
nodded
,
his
eyes
staring
oddly
.
Stepping
back
to
let
some
one
*NL*
pass
,
he
knocked
the
dish
of
olives
to
a
crash
on
the
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Too
bad
,
''
he
muttered
.
``
Have
a
drink
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Wilson
,
ponderously
diplomatic
,
reached
over
and
slapped
him
on
the
*NL*
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
had
plenty
,
old
boy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
eyed
him
dumbly
until
Wilson
grew
embarrassed
under
the
scrutiny
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Plenty
,
hell
!
''
said
Amory
finally
.
``
I
have
n't
had
a
drink
to-day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Wilson
looked
incredulous
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
a
drink
or
not
?
''
cried
Amory
rudely
.
*NL*
*NL*
Together
they
sought
the
bar
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rye
high
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
just
take
a
Bronx
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Wilson
had
another
;
Amory
had
several
more
.
They
decided
to
sit
down
.
*NL*
At
ten
o'clock
Wilson
was
displaced
by
Carling
,
class
of
'
15
.
Amory
,
his
*NL*
head
spinning
gorgeously
,
layer
upon
layer
of
soft
satisfaction
setting
*NL*
over
the
bruised
spots
of
his
spirit
,
was
discoursing
volubly
on
the
*NL*
war
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
'S
a
mental
was
`
e
,
''
he
insisted
with
owl-like
wisdom
.
``
Two
years

*NL*
life

inalleshual
vacuity
.
Los

idealism

*NL*
he
shook
his
fist
expressively
at
Old
King
Cole
,
``

Now
*NL*

''
He
expressed
his
lack
of
principle
by
sweeping
a
seltzer
*NL*
bottle
with
a
broad
gesture
to
noisy
extinction
on
the
floor
,
but
this
*NL*
did
not
interrupt
his
speech
.
``
Seek

`
At

phy

*NL*
*NL*
Carling
yawned
,
but
Amory
,
waxing
brilliant
,
continued
:
*NL*
*NL*
``

Now

''
He
became
so
emphatic
*NL*
in
impressing
on
Carling
the
fact
that
he
did
n't
wonder
that
he
lost
the
*NL*
thread
of
his
discourse
and
concluded
by
announcing
to
the
bar
at

*NL*
that
he
was

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
celebrating
,
Amory
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
leaned
forward
confidentially
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cel

brating

Great
moment
blow
my
life
.
Ca
n't

you

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
heard
Carling
addressing
a
remark
to
the
bartender
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
him
a
bromo-seltzer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
shook
his
head
indignantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
None
that
stuff
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
listen
,
Amory
,
you
're
making
yourself
sick
.
You
're
white
as
a
*NL*
ghost
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
considered
the
question
.
He
tried
to
look
at
himself
in
the
mirror
*NL*
but
even
by
squinting
up
one
eye
could
only
see
as
far
as
the
row
of
*NL*
bottles
behind
the
bar
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Like
som
'n
solid
.
We
go
get
some
--
some
salad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
settled
his
coat
with
an
attempt
at
nonchalance
,
but
letting
go
of
*NL*
the
bar
was
too
much
for
him
,
and
he
slumped
against
a
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
'll
go
over
to
Shanley
's
,
''
suggested
Carling
,
offering
an
elbow
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
this
assistance
Amory
managed
to
get
his
legs
in
motion
enough
to
*NL*
propel
him
across
Forty-second
Street
.
*NL*
*NL*
Shanley
's
was
very
dim
.
He
was
conscious
that
he
was
talking
in
a
loud
*NL*
voice
,
very
succinctly
and
convincingly
,
he
thought
,
about
a
desire
*NL*
to
crush
people
under
his
heel
.
He
consumed
three
club
sandwiches
,
*NL*
devouring
each
as
though
it
were
no
larger
than
a
chocolate-drop
.
*NL*
Then
Rosalind
began
popping
into
his
mind
again
,
and
he
found
his
lips
*NL*
forming
her
name
over
and
over
.
Next
he
was
sleepy
,
and
he
had
a
hazy
,
*NL*
listless
sense
of
people
in
dress
suits
,
probably
waiters
,
gathering
*NL*
around
the
table
...
*NL*
*NL*
...
He
was
in
a
room
and
Carling
was
saying
something
about
a
knot
in
*NL*
his
shoe-lace
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nemmine
,
''
he
managed
to
articulate
drowsily
.
``
Sleep
in
'em
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
*****
*NL*
*NL*
STILL
ALCOHOLIC
*NL*
*NL*
He
awoke
laughing
and
his
eyes
lazily
roamed
his
surroundings
,
evidently
*NL*
a
bedroom
and
bath
in
a
good
hotel
.
His
head
was
whirring
and
picture
*NL*
after
picture
was
forming
and
blurring
and
melting
before
his
eyes
,
but
*NL*
beyond
the
desire
to
laugh
he
had
no
entirely
conscious
reaction
.
He
*NL*
reached
for
the
`
phone
beside
his
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hello
--
what
hotel
is
this
--
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
Knickerbocker
?
All
right
,
send
up
two
rye
high-balls
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
lay
for
a
moment
and
wondered
idly
whether
they
'd
send
up
a
bottle
*NL*
or
just
two
of
those
little
glass
containers
.
Then
,
with
an
effort
,
he
*NL*
struggled
out
of
bed
and
ambled
into
the
bathroom
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
emerged
,
rubbing
himself
lazily
with
a
towel
,
he
found
the
bar
*NL*
boy
with
the
drinks
and
had
a
sudden
desire
to
kid
him
.
On
reflection
he
*NL*
decided
that
this
would
be
undignified
,
so
he
waved
him
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
new
alcohol
tumbled
into
his
stomach
and
warmed
him
,
the
isolated
*NL*
pictures
began
slowly
to
form
a
cinema
reel
of
the
day
before
.
Again
he
*NL*
saw
Rosalind
curled
weeping
among
the
pillows
,
again
he
felt
her
tears
*NL*
against
his
cheek
.
Her
words
began
ringing
in
his
ears
:
``
Do
n't
ever
*NL*
forget
me
,
Amory
--
do
n't
ever
forget
me
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hell
!
''
he
faltered
aloud
,
and
then
he
choked
and
collapsed
on
the
*NL*
bed
in
a
shaken
spasm
of
grief
.
After
a
minute
he
opened
his
eyes
and
*NL*
regarded
the
ceiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Damned
fool
!
''
he
exclaimed
in
disgust
,
and
with
a
voluminous
sigh
rose
*NL*
and
approached
the
bottle
.
After
another
glass
he
gave
way
loosely
*NL*
to
the
luxury
of
tears
.
Purposely
he
called
up
into
his
mind
little
*NL*
incidents
of
the
vanished
spring
,
phrased
to
himself
emotions
that
would
*NL*
make
him
react
even
more
strongly
to
sorrow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
were
so
happy
,
''
he
intoned
dramatically
,
``
so
very
happy
.
''
Then
he
*NL*
gave
way
again
and
knelt
beside
the
bed
,
his
head
half-buried
in
the
*NL*
pillow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
own
girl
--
my
own
--
Oh
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
clinched
his
teeth
so
that
the
tears
streamed
in
a
flood
from
his
*NL*
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
...
my
baby
girl
,
all
I
had
,
all
I
wanted
!
...
Oh
,
my
girl
,
come
back
,
*NL*
come
back
!
I
need
you
...
need
you
...
we
're
so
pitiful
...
just
misery
we
*NL*
brought
each
other
...
She
'll
be
shut
away
from
me
...
I
ca
n't
see
her
;
*NL*
I
ca
n't
be
her
friend
.
It
's
got
to
be
that
way
--
it
's
got
to
be
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
again
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
've
been
so
happy
,
so
very
happy
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
rose
to
his
feet
and
threw
himself
on
the
bed
in
an
ecstasy
of
*NL*
sentiment
,
and
then
lay
exhausted
while
he
realized
slowly
that
he
had
*NL*
been
very
drunk
the
night
before
,
and
that
his
head
was
spinning
again
*NL*
wildly
.
He
laughed
,
rose
,
and
crossed
again
to
Lethe
...
*NL*
*NL*
At
noon
he
ran
into
a
crowd
in
the
Biltmore
bar
,
and
the
riot
began
*NL*
again
.
He
had
a
vague
recollection
afterward
of
discussing
French
poetry
*NL*
with
a
British
officer
who
was
introduced
to
him
as
``
Captain
Corn
,
of
*NL*
his
Majesty
's
Foot
,
''
and
he
remembered
attempting
to
recite
``
Clair
de
*NL*
Lune
''
at
luncheon
;
then
he
slept
in
a
big
,
soft
chair
until
almost
*NL*
five
o'clock
when
another
crowd
found
and
woke
him
;
there
followed
an
*NL*
alcoholic
dressing
of
several
temperaments
for
the
ordeal
of
dinner
.
*NL*
They
selected
theatre
tickets
at
Tyson
's
for
a
play
that
had
a
*NL*
four-drink
programme
--
a
play
with
two
monotonous
voices
,
with
turbid
,
*NL*
gloomy
scenes
,
and
lighting
effects
that
were
hard
to
follow
when
his
*NL*
eyes
behaved
so
amazingly
.
He
imagined
afterward
that
it
must
have
been
*NL*
``
The
Jest
.
''
...
*NL*
*NL*
...
Then
the
Cocoanut
Grove
,
where
Amory
slept
again
on
a
little
balcony
*NL*
outside
.
Out
in
Shanley
's
,
Yonkers
,
he
became
almost
logical
,
and
by
a
*NL*
careful
control
of
the
number
of
high-balls
he
drank
,
grew
quite
lucid
*NL*
and
garrulous
.
He
found
that
the
party
consisted
of
five
men
,
two
of
*NL*
whom
he
knew
slightly
;
he
became
righteous
about
paying
his
share
of
the
*NL*
expense
and
insisted
in
a
loud
voice
on
arranging
everything
then
and
*NL*
there
to
the
amusement
of
the
tables
around
him
...
*NL*
*NL*
Some
one
mentioned
that
a
famous
cabaret
star
was
at
the
next
table
,
*NL*
so
Amory
rose
and
,
approaching
gallantly
,
introduced
himself
...
this
*NL*
involved
him
in
an
argument
,
first
with
her
escort
and
then
with
the
*NL*
headwaiter
--
Amory
's
attitude
being
a
lofty
and
exaggerated
courtesy
...
*NL*
he
consented
,
after
being
confronted
with
irrefutable
logic
,
to
being
*NL*
led
back
to
his
own
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Decided
to
commit
suicide
,
''
he
announced
suddenly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
?
Next
year
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
.
To-morrow
morning
.
Going
to
take
a
room
at
the
Commodore
,
get
into
*NL*
a
hot
bath
and
open
a
vein
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
getting
morbid
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
need
another
rye
,
old
boy
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
'll
all
talk
it
over
to-morrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Amory
was
not
to
be
dissuaded
,
from
argument
at
least
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
ever
get
that
way
?
''
he
demanded
confidentially
fortaccio
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sure
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Often
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
chronic
state
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
provoked
discussion
.
One
man
said
that
he
got
so
depressed
*NL*
sometimes
that
he
seriously
considered
it
.
Another
agreed
that
there
was
*NL*
nothing
to
live
for
.
``
Captain
Corn
,
''
who
had
somehow
rejoined
the
party
,
*NL*
said
that
in
his
opinion
it
was
when
one
's
health
was
bad
that
one
felt
*NL*
that
way
most
.
Amory
's
suggestion
was
that
they
should
each
order
a
*NL*
Bronx
,
mix
broken
glass
in
it
,
and
drink
it
off
.
To
his
relief
no
one
*NL*
applauded
the
idea
,
so
having
finished
his
high-ball
,
he
balanced
his
*NL*
chin
in
his
hand
and
his
elbow
on
the
table
--
a
most
delicate
,
scarcely
*NL*
noticeable
sleeping
position
,
he
assured
himself
--
and
went
into
a
deep
*NL*
stupor
...
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
awakened
by
a
woman
clinging
to
him
,
a
pretty
woman
,
with
brown
,
*NL*
disarranged
hair
and
dark
blue
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
me
home
!
''
she
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hello
!
''
said
Amory
,
blinking
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
like
you
,
''
she
announced
tenderly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
like
you
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
noticed
that
there
was
a
noisy
man
in
the
background
and
that
one
of
*NL*
his
party
was
arguing
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fella
I
was
with
's
a
damn
fool
,
''
confided
the
blue-eyed
woman
.
``
I
hate
*NL*
him
.
I
want
to
go
home
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
drunk
?
''
queried
Amory
with
intense
wisdom
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
nodded
coyly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
home
with
him
,
''
he
advised
gravely
.
``
He
brought
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
point
the
noisy
man
in
the
background
broke
away
from
his
*NL*
detainers
and
approached
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
!
''
he
said
fiercely
.
``
I
brought
this
girl
out
here
and
you
're
*NL*
butting
in
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
regarded
him
coldly
,
while
the
girl
clung
to
him
closer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
let
go
that
girl
!
''
cried
the
noisy
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
tried
to
make
his
eyes
threatening
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
go
to
hell
!
''
he
directed
finally
,
and
turned
his
attention
to
the
*NL*
girl
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Love
first
sight
,
''
he
suggested
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
love
you
,
''
she
breathed
and
nestled
close
to
him
.
She
_
did
_
have
*NL*
beautiful
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
one
leaned
over
and
spoke
in
Amory
's
ear
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
just
Margaret
Diamond
.
She
's
drunk
and
this
fellow
here
brought
*NL*
her
.
Better
let
her
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
him
take
care
of
her
,
then
!
''
shouted
Amory
furiously
.
``
I
'm
no

*NL*
*NL*
``
Let

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
_
her
_
hanging
on
,
damn
it
!
Let
her
hang
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
crowd
around
the
table
thickened
.
For
an
instant
a
brawl
threatened
,
*NL*
but
a
sleek
waiter
bent
back
Margaret
Diamond
's
fingers
until
she
*NL*
released
her
hold
on
Amory
,
whereupon
she
slapped
the
waiter
furiously
*NL*
in
the
face
and
flung
her
arms
about
her
raging
original
escort
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Lord
!
''
cried
Amory
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
's
go
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
on

the
taxis
are
getting
scarce

*NL*
*NL*
``
Check

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
C'mon
,
Amory

Your
romance
is
over

''
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You

n't
know
how
true

spoke

No

At

AMORY
ON
THE
LABOR
QUESTION
*NL*
*NL*
Two
mornings
later
he
knocked
at
the
president
's
door
at
Bascome
and
*NL*
Barlow
's
advertising
agency
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
in
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
entered
unsteadily
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Morning
,
Mr.
Barlow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Barlow
brought
his
glasses
to
the
inspection
and
set
his
mouth
*NL*
slightly
ajar
that
he
might
better
listen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Mr.
Blaine
.
We
have
n't
seen
you
for
several
days
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

''
said
Amory
.
``
I
'm
quitting

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

well

this
is

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do

like
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sorry

I
thought
our
relations
had
been
quite

ah

pleasant

You

seemed
to
be
a
hard
worker

a
little
inclined
perhaps
to
write
fancy
*NL*
copy

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
just
got
tired
of
it

interrupted
Amory
rudely
.
``
It
did

damn

any
better

else

*NL*
In
fact

I
never
ate
any

So
I
got
tired

telling

know
I

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Barlow
's
face
steeled
by
several
ingots
of
expression
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
asked
for

*NL*
*NL*
Amory
waved
him
to
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
think
I
was
rottenly
underpaid

Thirty-five

Mr.

coolly

*NL*
*NL*
They
stood
for
a

looking
at
each
other
impassively

then
Amory

turned
and
left
the

A
LITTLE
LULL
*NL*
*NL*
Four
days
after
that
he
returned
at
last
to
the
apartment
.
Tom
was
*NL*
engaged
on
a
book
review
for
The
New
Democracy
on
the
staff
of
which
he
*NL*
was
employed
.
They
regarded
each
other
for
a
moment
in
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
Lord
,
Amory
,
where
'd
you
get
the
black
eye
--
and
the
jaw
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
a
mere
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
peeled
off
his
coat
and
bared
his
shoulders
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
here
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
emitted
a
low
whistle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
hit
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
laughed
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
a
lot
of
people
.
I
got
beaten
up
.
Fact
.
''
He
slowly
replaced
his
*NL*
shirt
.
``
It
was
bound
to
come
sooner
or
later
and
I
would
n't
have
missed
*NL*
it
for
anything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
was
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
there
were
some
waiters
and
a
couple
of
sailors
and
a
few
stray
*NL*
pedestrians
,
I
guess
.
It
's
the
strangest
feeling
.
You
ought
to
get
*NL*
beaten
up
just
for
the
experience
of
it
.
You
fall
down
after
a
while
and
*NL*
everybody
sort
of
slashes
in
at
you
before
you
hit
the
ground
--
then
they
*NL*
kick
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
lighted
a
cigarette
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
spent
a
day
chasing
you
all
over
town
,
Amory
.
But
you
always
kept
a
*NL*
little
ahead
of
me
.
I
'd
say
you
've
been
on
some
party
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
tumbled
into
a
chair
and
asked
for
a
cigarette
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
sober
now
?
''
asked
Tom
quizzically
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pretty
sober

Why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

Alec
has
left

His
family
had
been
after
him
to
go
home
and
live
,
*NL*
so

--
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
spasm
of
pain
shook
Amory
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Too
bad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
is
too
bad

We
'll
have
to
get
some
one
else
if
we
're
going

stay
here

The
rent
's
going
up

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sure
.
Get
anybody
.
I
'll
leave
it
to
you
,
Tom
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
walked
into
his
bedroom
.
The
first
thing
that
met
his
glance
was
*NL*
a
photograph
of
Rosalind
that
he
had
intended
to
have
framed
,
propped
*NL*
up
against
a
mirror
on
his
dresser
.
He
looked
at
it
unmoved
.
After
*NL*
the
vivid
mental
pictures
of
her
that
were
his
portion
at
present
,
the
*NL*
portrait
was
curiously
unreal
.
He
went
back
into
the
study
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Got
a
cardboard
box
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
answered
Tom
,
puzzled
.
``
Why
should
I
have
?
Oh
,
yes
--
there
may
be
*NL*
one
in
Alec
's
room
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Eventually
Amory
found
what
he
was
looking
for
and
,
returning
to
his
*NL*
dresser
,
opened
a
drawer
full
of
letters
,
notes
,
part
of
a
chain
,
*NL*
two
little
handkerchiefs
,
and
some
snap-shots
.
As
he
transferred
them
*NL*
carefully
to
the
box
his
mind
wandered
to
some
place
in
a
book
where
*NL*
the
hero
,
after
preserving
for
a
year
a
cake
of
his
lost
love
's
soap
,
*NL*
finally
washed
his
hands
with
it
.
He
laughed
and
began
to
hum
``
After
*NL*
you
've
gone
''
...
ceased
abruptly
...
*NL*
*NL*
The
string
broke
twice
,
and
then
he
managed
to
secure
it
,
dropped
*NL*
the
package
into
the
bottom
of
his
trunk
,
and
having
slammed
the
lid
*NL*
returned
to
the
study
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Going
out
?
''
Tom
's
voice
held
an
undertone
of
anxiety
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Uh-huh

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Could

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
Sorry

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
Amory
crossed
the
street
and
had
a
high-ball
;
then
he
walked
to
*NL*
Washington
Square
and
found
a
top
seat
on
a
bus
.
He
disembarked
at
*NL*
Forty-third
Street
and
strolled
to
the
Biltmore
bar
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hi
,

*NL*
*NL*
``

TEMPERATURE
NORMAL
*NL*
*NL*
The
advent
of
prohibition
with
the
``
thirsty-first
''
put
a
sudden
stop
to
*NL*
the
submerging
of
Amory
's
sorrows
,
and
when
he
awoke
one
morning
to
find
*NL*
that
the
old
bar-to-bar
days
were
over
,
he
had
neither
remorse
for
the
*NL*
past
three
weeks
nor
regret
that
their
repetition
was
impossible
.
He
had
*NL*
taken
the
most
violent
,
if
the
weakest
,
method
to
shield
himself
*NL*
from
the
stabs
of
memory
,
and
while
it
was
not
a
course
he
would
*NL*
have
prescribed
for
others
,
he
found
in
the
end
that
it
had
done
its
*NL*
business
:
he
was
over
the
first
flush
of
pain
.
*NL*
*NL*
Do
n't
misunderstand
!
Amory
had
loved
Rosalind
as
he
would
never
love
*NL*
another
living
person
.
She
had
taken
the
first
flush
of
his
youth
and
*NL*
brought
from
his
unplumbed
depths
tenderness
that
had
surprised
*NL*
him
,
gentleness
and
unselfishness
that
he
had
never
given
to
another
*NL*
creature
.
He
had
later
love-affairs
,
but
of
a
different
sort
:
in
those
*NL*
he
went
back
to
that
,
perhaps
,
more
typical
frame
of
mind
,
in
which
the
*NL*
girl
became
the
mirror
of
a
mood
in
him
.
Rosalind
had
drawn
out
what
was
*NL*
more
than
passionate
admiration
;
he
had
a
deep
,
undying
affection
for
*NL*
Rosalind
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
there
had
been
,
near
the
end
,
so
much
dramatic
tragedy
,
culminating
*NL*
in
the
arabesque
nightmare
of
his
three
weeks
'
spree
,
that
he
was
*NL*
emotionally
worn
out
.
The
people
and
surroundings
that
he
remembered
as
*NL*
being
cool
or
delicately
artificial
,
seemed
to
promise
him
a
refuge
.
He
*NL*
wrote
a
cynical
story
which
featured
his
father
's
funeral
and
despatched
*NL*
it
to
a
magazine
,
receiving
in
return
a
check
for
sixty
dollars
and
a
*NL*
request
for
more
of
the
same
tone
.
This
tickled
his
vanity
,
but
inspired
*NL*
him
to
no
further
effort
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
read
enormously
.
He
was
puzzled
and
depressed
by
``
A
Portrait
of
the
*NL*
Artist
as
a
Young
Man
''
;
intensely
interested
by
``
Joan
and
Peter
''
and
*NL*
``
The
Undying
Fire
,
''
and
rather
surprised
by
his
discovery
through
a
*NL*
critic
named
Mencken
of
several
excellent
American
novels
:
``
Vandover
*NL*
and
the
Brute
,
''
``
The
Damnation
of
Theron
Ware
,
''
and
``
Jennie
Gerhardt
.
''
*NL*
Mackenzie
,
Chesterton
,
Galsworthy
,
Bennett
,
had
sunk
in
his
*NL*
appreciation
from
sagacious
,
life-saturated
geniuses
to
merely
diverting
*NL*
contemporaries
.
Shaw
's
aloof
clarity
and
brilliant
consistency
and
the
*NL*
gloriously
intoxicated
efforts
of
H.
G.
Wells
to
fit
the
key
of
romantic
*NL*
symmetry
into
the
elusive
lock
of
truth
,
alone
won
his
rapt
attention
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
wanted
to
see
Monsignor
Darcy
,
to
whom
he
had
written
when
he
landed
,
*NL*
but
he
had
not
heard
from
him
;
besides
he
knew
that
a
visit
to
Monsignor
*NL*
would
entail
the
story
of
Rosalind
,
and
the
thought
of
repeating
it
*NL*
turned
him
cold
with
horror
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
his
search
for
cool
people
he
remembered
Mrs.
Lawrence
,
a
very
*NL*
intelligent
,
very
dignified
lady
,
a
convert
to
the
church
,
and
a
great
*NL*
devotee
of
Monsignor
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
called
her
on
the
`
phone
one
day
.
Yes
,
she
remembered
him
perfectly
;
*NL*
no
,
Monsignor
was
n't
in
town
,
was
in
Boston
she
thought
;
he
'd
promised
*NL*
to
come
to
dinner
when
he
returned
.
Could
n't
Amory
take
luncheon
with
*NL*
her
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
I
'd
better
catch
up
,
Mrs.
Lawrence
,
''
he
said
rather
*NL*
ambiguously
when
he
arrived
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsignor
was
here
just
last
week
,
''
said
Mrs.
Lawrence
regretfully
.
``
He
*NL*
was
very
anxious
to
see
you
,
but
he
'd
left
your
address
at
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
he
think
I
'd
plunged
into
Bolshevism
?
''
asked
Amory
,
interested
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
he
's
having
a
frightful
time
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
About

Republic

He
thinks
it
lacks
dignity

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
went
to
Boston
when
the
Irish
President
arrived
and
he
was
greatly
*NL*
distressed
because
the
receiving
committee
,
when
they
rode
in
an
*NL*
automobile
,
_
would
_
put
their
arms
around

President

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
blame
him

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

what
impressed
you
more
than
anything
while
you
were
in
the
army
?
*NL*

look
a
great
deal
older
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
from
another
,
more
disastrous
battle
,
''
he
answered
,
smiling
in
*NL*
spite
of
himself
.
``
But
the
army
--
let
me
see
--
well
,
I
discovered
that
*NL*
physical
courage
depends
to
a
great
extent
on
the
physical
shape
a
man
*NL*
is
in
.
I
found
that
I
was
as
brave
as
the
next
man
--
it
used
to
worry
me
*NL*
before
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
else
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
the
idea
that
men
can
stand
anything
if
they
get
used
to
it
,
and
*NL*
the
fact
that
I
got
a
high
mark
in
the
psychological
examination
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Lawrence
laughed
.
Amory
was
finding
it
a
great
relief
to
be
in
this
*NL*
cool
house
on
Riverside
Drive
,
away
from
more
condensed
New
York
and
*NL*
the
sense
of
people
expelling
great
quantities
of
breath
into
a
*NL*
little
space
.
Mrs.
Lawrence
reminded
him
vaguely
of
Beatrice
,
not
*NL*
in
temperament
,
but
in
her
perfect
grace
and
dignity
.
The
house
,
its
*NL*
furnishings
,
the
manner
in
which
dinner
was
served
,
were
in
immense
*NL*
contrast
to
what
he
had
met
in
the
great
places
on
Long
Island
,
where
*NL*
the
servants
were
so
obtrusive
that
they
had
positively
to
be
bumped
*NL*
out
of
the
way
,
or
even
in
the
houses
of
more
conservative
``
Union
Club
''
*NL*
families
.
He
wondered
if
this
air
of
symmetrical
restraint
,
this
grace
,
*NL*
which
he
felt
was
continental
,
was
distilled
through
Mrs.
Lawrence
's
New
*NL*
England
ancestry
or
acquired
in
long
residence
in
Italy
and
Spain
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
glasses
of
sauterne
at
luncheon
loosened
his
tongue
,
and
he
talked
,
*NL*
with
what
he
felt
was
something
of
his
old
charm
,
of
religion
and
*NL*
literature
and
the
menacing
phenomena
of
the
social
order
.
Mrs.
Lawrence
*NL*
was
ostensibly
pleased
with
him
,
and
her
interest
was
especially
in
his
*NL*
mind
;
he
wanted
people
to
like
his
mind
again
--
after
a
while
it
might
be
*NL*
such
a
nice
place
in
which
to
live
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsignor
Darcy
still
thinks
that
you
're
his
reincarnation
,
that
your
*NL*
faith
will
eventually
clarify
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
,
''
he
assented
.
``
I
'm
rather
pagan
at
present
.
It
's
just
that
*NL*
religion
does
n't
seem
to
have
the
slightest
bearing
on
life
at
my
age
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
left
her
house
he
walked
down
Riverside
Drive
with
a
feeling
*NL*
of
satisfaction
.
It
was
amusing
to
discuss
again
such
subjects
as
this
*NL*
young
poet
,
Stephen
Vincent
Benet
,
or
the
Irish
Republic
.
Between
*NL*
the
rancid
accusations
of
Edward
Carson
and
Justice
Cohalan
he
had
*NL*
completely
tired
of
the
Irish
question
;
yet
there
had
been
a
time
when
*NL*
his
own
Celtic
traits
were
pillars
of
his
personal
philosophy
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
seemed
suddenly
to
be
much
left
in
life
,
if
only
this
revival
*NL*
of
old
interests
did
not
mean
that
he
was
backing
away
from
it
*NL*
again
--
backing
away
from
life
itself
.

Amory
one

always

,
with
the
domesticity
of
an
elderly
cat
,
had
grown
fond
of
.
The
old
*NL*
English
hunting
prints
on
the
wall
were
Tom
's
,
and
the
large
tapestry
by
*NL*
courtesy
,
a
relic
of
decadent
days
in
college
,
and
the
great
profusion
*NL*
of
orphaned
candlesticks
and
the
carved
Louis
XV
chair
in
which
no
one
*NL*
could
sit
more
than
a
minute
without
acute
spinal
disorders
--
Tom
*NL*
claimed
that
this
was
because
one
was
sitting
in
the
lap
of
Montespan
's
*NL*
wraith
--
at
any
rate
,
it
was
Tom
's
furniture
that
decided
them
to
stay
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
went
out
very
little
:
to
an
occasional
play
,
or
to
dinner
at
the
*NL*
Ritz
or
the
Princeton
Club
.
With
prohibition
the
great
rendezvous
had
*NL*
received
their
death
wounds
;
no
longer
could
one
wander
to
the
Biltmore
*NL*
bar
at
twelve
or
five
and
find
congenial
spirits
,
and
both
Tom
and
Amory
*NL*
had
outgrown
the
passion
for
dancing
with
mid-Western
or
New
Jersey
*NL*
debbies
at
the
Club-de-Vingt
-LRB-
surnamed
the
``
Club
de
Gink
''
-RRB-
or
the
Plaza
*NL*
Rose
Room
--
besides
even
that
required
several
cocktails
``
to
come
down
to
*NL*
the
intellectual
level
of
the
women
present
,
''
as
Amory
had
once
put
it
*NL*
to
a
horrified
matron
.
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
had
lately
received
several
alarming
letters
from
Mr.
Barton
--
the
*NL*
Lake
Geneva
house
was
too
large
to
be
easily
rented
;
the
best
rent
*NL*
obtainable
at
present
would
serve
this
year
to
little
more
than
pay
for
*NL*
the
taxes
and
necessary
improvements
;
in
fact
,
the
lawyer
suggested
*NL*
that
the
whole
property
was
simply
a
white
elephant
on
Amory
's
hands
.
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
even
though
it
might
not
yield
a
cent
for
the
next
three
*NL*
years
,
Amory
decided
with
a
vague
sentimentality
that
for
the
present
,
*NL*
at
any
rate
,
he
would
not
sell
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
particular
day
on
which
he
announced
his
ennui
to
Tom
had
been
*NL*
quite
typical
.
He
had
risen
at
noon
,
lunched
with
Mrs.
Lawrence
,
and
*NL*
then
ridden
abstractedly
homeward
atop
one
of
his
beloved
buses
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
should
n't
you
be
bored
,
''
yawned
Tom
.
``
Is
n't
that
the
conventional
*NL*
frame
of
mind
for
the
young
man
of
your
age
and
condition
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Amory
speculatively
,
``
but
I
'm
more
than
bored
;
I
am
*NL*
restless

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Love
and
war
did
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
Amory
considered
,
``
I
'm
not
sure
that
the
war
itself
had
any
*NL*
great
effect
on
either
you
or
me
--
but
it
certainly
ruined
the
old
*NL*
backgrounds
,
sort
of
killed
individualism
out
of
our
generation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
looked
up
in
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
it
did
,
''
insisted
Amory
.
``
I
'm
not
sure
it
did
n't
kill
it
out
of
the
*NL*
whole

what
a
pleasure
it
used
to
be
to
dream
I
might
be
*NL*
a
really
great
dictator

writer
or
religious
or
political
leader
--
and
*NL*
now
even
a
Leonardo
da

or
Lorenzo
de

could
n't
be
a
real
*NL*
old-fashioned
bolt
in
the
world
.
Life
is
too
huge
and
complex
.
The
world
*NL*
is
so
overgrown
that
it
ca
n't
lift
its
own
fingers

I
was
planning
*NL*
to
be
such
an
important
finger

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
agree
with
you

Tom
interrupted
.
``
There
never
were
men
placed
*NL*
in
such
egotistic
positions
since
--
oh
,
since
the
French
Revolution

''
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
disagreed
violently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
mistaking
this
period
when
every
nut
is
an
individualist
for
*NL*

period
of
individualism

Wilson
has
only
been
powerful
when
he
has
*NL*
represented
;
he
's
had
to
compromise
over

over
again
.
Just
as
soon
*NL*
as
Trotsky
and
Lenin
take
a
definite
,
consistent
stand
they
'll
become
*NL*
merely
two-minute
figures
like
Kerensky
.
Even
Foch
has
n't
half
*NL*
the
significance
of
Stonewall
Jackson
.
War
used
to
be
the
most
*NL*
individualistic
pursuit
of
man
,
and
yet
the
popular
heroes
of
the
war
*NL*
had
neither
authority
nor
responsibility

Guynemer
and
Sergeant
York
.
*NL*
How
could
a
schoolboy
make
a
hero
of
Pershing
?
A
big

has
no
time
*NL*
really
to
do
anything

just
sit
and
be
big

*NL*
Amory
did
not

LOOKING
BACKWARD
*NL*
*NL*
July
sweltered
out
with
a
last
hot
week
,
and
Amory
in
another
surge
of
*NL*
unrest
realized
that
it
was
just
five
months
since
he
and
Rosalind
had
*NL*
met
.
Yet
it
was
already
hard
for
him
to
visualize
the
heart-whole
boy
*NL*
who
had
stepped
off
the
transport
,
passionately
desiring
the
adventure
*NL*
of
life
.
One
night
while
the
heat
,
overpowering
and
enervating
,
poured
*NL*
into
the
windows
of
his
room
he
struggled
for
several
hours
in
a
vague
*NL*
effort
to
immortalize
the
poignancy
of
that
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
February
streets
,
wind-washed
by
night
,
blow
full
of
strange
*NL*
half-intermittent
damps
,
bearing
on
wasted
walks
in
shining
sight
*NL*
wet
snow
plashed
into
gleams
under
the
lamps
,
like
golden
oil
*NL*
from
some
divine
machine
,
in
an
hour
of
thaw
and
stars
.
*NL*
*NL*
Strange
damps
--
full
of
the
eyes
of
many
men
,
crowded
with
life
*NL*
borne
in
upon
a
lull
...
Oh
,
I
was
young
,
for
I
could
turn
*NL*
again
to
you
,
most
finite
and
most
beautiful
,
and
taste
the
stuff
*NL*
of
half-remembered
dreams
,
sweet
and
new
on
your
mouth
.
*NL*
*NL*
...
There
was
a
tanging
in
the
midnight
air
--
silence
was
dead
and
*NL*
sound
not
yet
awoken
--
Life
cracked
like
ice
!
--
one
brilliant
note
*NL*
and
there
,
radiant
and
pale
,
you
stood
...
and
spring
had
broken

The
icicles
were
short
upon
the
roofs
and
the
changeling
city
*NL*
swooned
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
Our
thoughts
were
frosty
mist
along
the
eaves
;
our
two
ghosts
*NL*
kissed
,
high
on
the
long
,
mazed
wires
--
eerie
half-laughter
echoes
*NL*
here
and
leaves
only
a
fatuous
sigh
for
young
desires
;
regret
has
*NL*
followed
after
things
she
loved

leaving
the
great

ANOTHER
ENDING
*NL*
*NL*
In
mid-August
came
a
letter
from
Monsignor
Darcy
,
who
had
evidently
just
*NL*
stumbled
on
his
address
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
MY
DEAR
BOY
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
Your
last
letter
was
quite
enough
to
make
me
worry
about
you
.
It
was
*NL*
not
a
bit
like
yourself
.
Reading
between
the
lines
I
should
imagine
that
*NL*
your
engagement
to
this
girl
is
making
you
rather
unhappy
,
and
I
see
you
*NL*
have
lost
all
the
feeling
of
romance
that
you
had
before
the
war
.
You
*NL*
make
a
great
mistake
if
you
think
you
can
be
romantic
without
religion
.
*NL*
Sometimes
I
think
that
with
both
of
us
the
secret
of
success
,
when
we
*NL*
find
it
,
is
the
mystical
element
in
us
:
something
flows
into
us
that
*NL*
enlarges
our
personalities
,
and
when
it
ebbs
out
our
personalities
*NL*
shrink
;
I
should
call
your
last
two
letters
rather
shrivelled
.
Beware
of
*NL*
losing
yourself
in
the
personality
of
another
being
,
man
or
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
Eminence
Cardinal
O'Neill
and
the
Bishop
of
Boston
are
staying
with
*NL*
me
at
present
,
so
it
is
hard
for
me
to
get
a
moment
to
write
,
but
I
wish
*NL*
you
would
come
up
here
later
if
only
for
a
week-end
.
I
go
to
Washington
*NL*
this
week
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
I
shall
do
in
the
future
is
hanging
in
the
balance
.
Absolutely
*NL*
between
ourselves
I
should
not
be
surprised
to
see
the
red
hat
of
a
*NL*
cardinal
descend
upon
my
unworthy
head
within
the
next
eight
months
.
In
*NL*
any
event
,
I
should
like
to
have
a
house
in
New
York
or
Washington
where
*NL*
you
could
drop
in
for
week-ends
.
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
,
I
'm
very
glad
we
're
both
alive
;
this
war
could
easily
have
been
*NL*
the
end
of
a
brilliant
family
.
But
in
regard
to
matrimony
,
you
are
now
*NL*
at
the
most
dangerous
period
of
your
life
.
You
might
marry
in
haste
and
*NL*
repent
at
leisure
,
but
I
think
you
wo
n't
.
From
what
you
write
me
*NL*
about
the
present
calamitous
state
of
your
finances
,
what
you
want
is
*NL*
naturally
impossible
.
However
,
if
I
judge
you
by
the
means
I
usually
*NL*
choose
,
I
should
say
that
there
will
be
something
of
an
emotional
crisis
*NL*
within
the
next
year
.
*NL*
*NL*
Do
write
me
.
I
feel
annoyingly
out
of
date
on
you
.

greatest
affection

THAYER
DARCY
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Within
a
week
after
the
receipt
of
this
letter
their
little
household
*NL*
fell
precipitously
to
pieces
.
The
immediate
cause
was
the
serious
and
*NL*
probably
chronic
illness
of
Tom
's
mother
.
So
they
stored
the
furniture
,
*NL*
gave
instructions
to
sublet
and
shook
hands
gloomily
in
the
Pennsylvania
*NL*
Station
.
Amory
and
Tom
seemed
always
to
be
saying
good-by
.
*NL*
*NL*
Feeling
very
much
alone
,
Amory
yielded
to
an
impulse
and
set
off
*NL*
southward
,
intending
to
join
Monsignor
in
Washington
.
They
missed
*NL*
connections
by
two
hours
,
and
,
deciding
to
spend
a
few
days
with
an
*NL*
ancient
,
remembered
uncle
,
Amory
journeyed
up
through
the
luxuriant
*NL*
fields
of
Maryland
into
Ramilly
County
.
But
instead
of
two
days
his
stay
*NL*
lasted
from
mid-August
nearly
through
September
,
for
in
Maryland
he
met
*NL*
Eleanor
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
3
.
Young
Irony
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
For
years
afterward
when
Amory
thought
of
Eleanor
he
seemed
still
to
*NL*
hear
the
wind
sobbing
around
him
and
sending
little
chills
into
the
*NL*
places
beside
his
heart
.
The
night
when
they
rode
up
the
slope
and
*NL*
watched
the
cold
moon
float
through
the
clouds
,
he
lost
a
further
part
*NL*
of
him
that
nothing
could
restore
;
and
when
he
lost
it
he
lost
also
the
*NL*
power
of
regretting
it
.
Eleanor
was
,
say
,
the
last
time
that
evil
crept
*NL*
close
to
Amory
under
the
mask
of
beauty
,
the
last
weird
mystery
that
*NL*
held
him
with
wild
fascination
and
pounded
his
soul
to
flakes
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
her
his
imagination
ran
riot
and
that
is
why
they
rode
to
the
*NL*
highest
hill
and
watched
an
evil
moon
ride
high
,
for
they
knew
then
that
*NL*
they
could
see
the
devil
in
each
other
.
But
Eleanor
--
did
Amory
dream
*NL*
her
?
Afterward
their
ghosts
played
,
yet
both
of
them
hoped
from
their
*NL*
souls
never
to
meet
.
Was
it
the
infinite
sadness
of
her
eyes
that
drew
*NL*
him
or
the
mirror
of
himself
that
he
found
in
the
gorgeous
clarity
of
*NL*
her
mind
?
She
will
have
no
other
adventure
like
Amory
,
and
if
she
reads
*NL*
this
she
will
say
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
Amory
will
have
no
other
adventure
like
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nor
will
she
sigh
,
any
more
than
he
would
sigh
.
*NL*
*NL*
Eleanor
tried
to
put
it
on
paper
once
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
fading
things
we
only
know
*NL*
We
'll
have
forgotten
...
*NL*
Put
away
...
*NL*
Desires
that
melted
with
the
snow
,
*NL*
And
dreams
begotten
*NL*
This
to-day
:
*NL*
The
sudden
dawns
we
laughed
to
greet
,
*NL*
That
all
could
see
,
that
none
could
share
,
*NL*
Will
be
but
dawns
...
and
if
we
meet
*NL*
We
shall
not
care
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dear
...
not
one
tear
will
rise
for
this
...
*NL*
A
little
while
hence
*NL*
No
regret
*NL*
Will
stir
for
a
remembered
kiss
--
*NL*
Not
even
silence
,
*NL*
When
we
've
met
,
*NL*
Will
give
old
ghosts
a
waste
to
roam
,
*NL*
Or
stir
the
surface
of
the
sea
...
*NL*
If
gray
shapes
drift
beneath
the
foam
*NL*
We
shall
not
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
They
quarrelled
dangerously
because
Amory
maintained
that
_
sea
_
and
*NL*
_
see
_
could
n't
possibly
be
used
as
a
rhyme
.
And
then
Eleanor
had
part
of
*NL*
another
verse
that
she
could
n't
find
a
beginning
for
:
*NL*
*NL*
''
...
But
wisdom
passes
...
still
the
years
*NL*
Will
feed
us
wisdom
...
Age
will
go
*NL*
Back
to
the
old
--
*NL*
For
all
our
tears
*NL*
We
shall
not
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Eleanor
hated
Maryland
passionately
.
She
belonged
to
the
oldest
of
the
*NL*
old
families
of
Ramilly
County
and
lived
in
a
big
,
gloomy
house
with
her
*NL*
grandfather
.
She
had
been
born
and
brought
up
in
France
...
I
see
I
am
*NL*
starting
wrong
.
Let
me
begin
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
was
bored
,
as
he
usually
was
in
the
country
.
He
used
to
go
for
*NL*
far
walks
by
himself
--
and
wander
along
reciting
``
Ulalume
''
to
the
*NL*
corn-fields
,
and
congratulating
Poe
for
drinking
himself
to
death
in
*NL*
that
atmosphere
of
smiling
complacency
.
One
afternoon
he
had
strolled
*NL*
for
several
miles
along
a
road
that
was
new
to
him
,
and
then
through
a
*NL*
wood
on
bad
advice
from
a
colored
woman
...
losing
himself
entirely
.
A
*NL*
passing
storm
decided
to
break
out
,
and
to
his
great
impatience
the
*NL*
sky
grew
black
as
pitch
and
the
rain
began
to
splatter
down
through
the
*NL*
trees
,
become
suddenly
furtive
and
ghostly
.
Thunder
rolled
with
menacing
*NL*
crashes
up
the
valley
and
scattered
through
the
woods
in
intermittent
*NL*
batteries
.
He
stumbled
blindly
on
,
hunting
for
a
way
out
,
and
finally
,
*NL*
through
webs
of
twisted
branches
,
caught
sight
of
a
rift
in
the
trees
*NL*
where
the
unbroken
lightning
showed
open
country
.
He
rushed
to
the
edge
*NL*
of
the
woods
and
then
hesitated
whether
or
not
to
cross
the
fields
and
*NL*
try
to
reach
the
shelter
of
the
little
house
marked
by
a
light
far
down
*NL*
the
valley
.
It
was
only
half
past
five
,
but
he
could
see
scarcely
ten
*NL*
steps
before
him
,
except
when
the
lightning
made
everything
vivid
and
*NL*
grotesque
for
great
sweeps
around
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
a
strange
sound
fell
on
his
ears
.
It
was
a
song
,
in
a
low
,
*NL*
husky
voice
,
a
girl
's
voice
,
and
whoever
was
singing
was
very
close
*NL*
to
him
.
A
year
before
he
might
have
laughed
,
or
trembled
;
but
in
his
*NL*
restless
mood
he
only
stood
and
listened
while
the
words
sank
into
his
*NL*
consciousness
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Les
sanglots
longs
*NL*
Des
violons
*NL*
De
l'automne
*NL*
Blessent
mon
coeur
*NL*
D'une
langueur
*NL*
Monotone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
lightning
split
the
sky
,
but
the
song
went
on
without
a
quaver
.
The
*NL*
girl
was
evidently
in
the
field
and
the
voice
seemed
to
come
vaguely
*NL*
from
a
haystack
about
twenty
feet
in
front
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
it
ceased
:
ceased
and
began
again
in
a
weird
chant
that
soared
and
*NL*
hung
and
fell
and
blended
with
the
rain
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tout
suffocant
*NL*
Et
bleme
quand
*NL*
Sonne
l'heure
*NL*
Je
me
souviens
*NL*
Des

*NL*
Et
je
pleure
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
the
devil
is
there
in
Ramilly
County
,
''
muttered
Amory
aloud
,
``
who
*NL*
would
deliver
Verlaine
in
an
extemporaneous
tune
to
a
soaking
haystack
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Somebody
's
there
!
''
cried
the
voice
unalarmed
.
``
Who
are
you
?
--
Manfred
,
*NL*
St.
Christopher
,
or
Queen
Victoria
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
Don
Juan
!
''
Amory
shouted
on
impulse
,
raising
his
voice
above
the
*NL*
noise
of
the
rain
and
the
wind
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
delighted
shriek
came
from
the
haystack
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
who
you
are
--
you
're
the
blond
boy
that
likes

Ulalume

I
*NL*

your
voice

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
I
get
up
?
''
he
cried
from
the
foot
of
the
haystack
,
whither
he
*NL*
had
arrived
,
dripping
wet
.
A
head
appeared
over
the
edge
--
it
was
so
dark
*NL*
that
Amory
could
just
make
out
a
patch
of
damp
hair
and
two
eyes
that
*NL*
gleamed
like
a
cat
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Run
back
!
''
came
the
voice
,
``
and
jump
and
I
'll
catch
your
hand
--
no
,
not
*NL*
there
--
on
the
other
side
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
followed
directions
and
as
he
sprawled
up
the
side
,
knee-deep
in
hay
,
*NL*
a
small
,
white
hand
reached
out
,
gripped
his
,
and
helped
him
onto
the
*NL*
top
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
you
are
,
Juan
,
''
cried
she
of
the
damp
hair
.
``
Do
you
mind
if
I
drop
*NL*
the
Don
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
got
a
thumb
like
mine
!
''
he
exclaimed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
're
holding
my
hand
,
which
is
dangerous
without
seeing
my
face
.
''
*NL*
He
dropped
it
quickly
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
if
in
answer
to
his
prayers
came
a
flash
of
lightning
and
he
looked
*NL*
eagerly
at
her
who
stood
beside
him
on
the
soggy
haystack
,
ten
feet
*NL*
above
the
ground
.
But
she
had
covered
her
face
and
he
saw
nothing
but
a
*NL*
slender
figure
,
dark
,
damp
,
bobbed
hair
,
and
the
small
white
hands
with
*NL*
the
thumbs
that
bent
back
like
his
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sit
down
,
''
she
suggested
politely
,
as
the
dark
closed
in
on
them
.
``
If
*NL*
you
'll
sit
opposite
me
in
this
hollow
you
can
have
half
of
the
raincoat
,
*NL*
which
I
was
using
as
a
water-proof
tent
until
you
so
rudely
interrupted
*NL*
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
asked
,
''
Amory
said
joyfully
;
``
you
asked
me
--
you
know
you
did
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Don
Juan
always
manages
that
,
''
she
said
,
laughing
,
``
but
I
sha
n't
call
*NL*
you
that
any
more
,
because
you
've
got
reddish
hair
.
Instead
you
can
*NL*
recite
`
Ulalume
'
and
I
'll
be
Psyche
,
your
soul
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
flushed
,
happily
invisible
under
the
curtain
of
wind
and
rain
.
*NL*
They
were
sitting
opposite
each
other
in
a
slight
hollow
in
the
hay
with
*NL*
the
raincoat
spread
over
most
of
them
,
and
the
rain
doing
for
the
rest
.
*NL*
Amory
was
trying
desperately
to
see
Psyche
,
but
the
lightning
refused
to
*NL*
flash
again
,
and
he
waited
impatiently
.
Good
Lord
!
supposing
she
was
n't
*NL*
beautiful
--
supposing
she
was
forty
and
pedantic
--
heavens
!
Suppose
,
*NL*
only
suppose
,
she
was
mad
.
But
he
knew
the
last
was
unworthy
.
Here
had
*NL*
Providence
sent
a
girl
to
amuse
him
just
as
it
sent
Benvenuto
Cellini
*NL*
men
to
murder
,
and
he
was
wondering
if
she
was
mad
,
just
because
she
*NL*
exactly
filled
his
mood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
mad
.
I
did
n't
think
you
were
mad
when
I
first
saw
you
,
so
it
is
n't
*NL*
fair
that
you
should
think
so
of
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
on
earth
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
long
as
they
knew
each
other
Eleanor
and
Amory
could
be
``
on
a
*NL*
subject
''
and
stop
talking
with
the
definite
thought
of
it
in
their
*NL*
heads
,
yet
ten
minutes
later
speak
aloud
and
find
that
their
minds
had
*NL*
followed
the
same
channels
and
led
them
each
to
a
parallel
idea
,
an
idea
*NL*
that
others
would
have
found
absolutely
unconnected
with
the
first
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
,
''
he
demanded
,
leaning
forward
eagerly
,
``
how
do
you
know
about
*NL*
`
Ulalume
'
--
how
did
you
know
the
color
of
my
hair
?
What
's
your
name
?
What
*NL*
were
you
doing
here
?
Tell
me
all
at
once
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
the
lightning
flashed
in
with
a
leap
of
overreaching
light
and
*NL*
he
saw
Eleanor
,
and
looked
for
the
first
time
into
those
eyes
of
hers
.
*NL*
Oh
,
she
was
magnificent
--
pale
skin
,
the
color
of
marble
in
starlight
,
*NL*
slender
brows
,
and
eyes
that
glittered
green
as
emeralds
in
the
blinding
*NL*
glare
.
She
was
a
witch
,
of
perhaps
nineteen
,
he
judged
,
alert
and
dreamy
*NL*
and
with
the
tell-tale
white
line
over
her
upper
lip
that
was
a
weakness
*NL*
and
a
delight
.
He
sank
back
with
a
gasp
against
the
wall
of
hay
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
you
've
seen
me
,
''
she
said
calmly
,
``
and
I
suppose
you
're
about
to
*NL*
say
that
my
green
eyes
are
burning
into
your
brain

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
color
is
your
hair

''
he
asked
intently
.
``
It
's
bobbed
,
is
n't
it

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
's
bobbed
.
I
do
n't
know
what
color

is

''
she
answered
,
musing
,
*NL*
``
so
many
men
have
asked
me

It
's
medium

I
suppose

No

ever

at

*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
silence
as
they
listened
to
the
rain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
going
down
my

she
offered
finally

*NL*
*NL*
``

of

she
answered
haughtily
,
``
must
lug

self
into
conversation

Well
,
my
boy

I
was
behind
a
hedge
sunning
*NL*
myself
one
day
last
week
,
and
along
comes
a
man
saying
in
a
pleasant

*NL*
conceited
way
of
talking
:

And

was

was
born

*NL*
*NL*
``
So
I
poked
my
eyes
up
over
the
hedge
,
but
you
had
started
to
run
,
for
*NL*
some
unknown
reason
,
and
so
I
saw
but
the
back
of
your
beautiful
head

*NL*
`
Oh
!

says
I
,
`
there
's
a
man
for
whom
many
of
us
might
sigh

I

continued
in
my
best
Irish

*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right

''
Amory
interrupted
.
``
Now
go
back
to
yourself

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

I
will

I
'm
one
of
those
people

go

giving

other
people
thrills
,
but
getting
few
myself
except
those
I
read
into
*NL*
men
on
such
nights
as
these
.
I
have
the
social
courage
to
go
on
the
*NL*
stage
,
but
not
the
energy
;
I
have
n't
the
patience

write
books

and
I
*NL*
never
met
a
man

However

I

only
eighteen

*NL*
*NL*
The
storm
was
dying
down
softly
and
only
the
wind
kept
up
its
ghostly
*NL*
surge
and
made
the
stack
lean
and
gravely
settle
from
side
to
side
.
*NL*
Amory
was
in
a
trance
.
He
felt
that
every
moment
was
precious
.
He
had
*NL*
never
met
a
girl
like
this
before
--
she
would
never
seem
quite
the
same
*NL*
again
.
He
did
n't
at
all
feel
like
a
character
in
a
play
,
the
appropriate
*NL*
feeling
in
an
unconventional
situation
--
instead
,
he
had
a
sense
of
*NL*
coming
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
just
made
a
great
decision
,
''
said
Eleanor
after
another
pause
,
*NL*
``
and
that
is
why
I
'm
here
,
to
answer
another
of
your
questions

I
have
*NL*
just
decided
that
I
do
n't
believe
in
immortality

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
!
how
banal
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Frightfully
so
,
''
she
answered
,
``
but
depressing
with
a
stale
,
sickly
*NL*
depression
,
nevertheless
.
I
came
out
here
to
get
wet
--
like
a
wet
hen
;
*NL*
wet
hens
always
have
great
clarity
of
mind
,
''
she
concluded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
on
,
''
Amory
said
politely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
I
'm
not
afraid
of
the
dark
,
so
I
put
on
my
slicker
and
rubber
*NL*
boots
and
came
out
.
You
see
I
was
always
afraid
,
before
,
to
say
I
did
n't
*NL*
believe
in
God
--
because
the
lightning
might
strike
me
--
but
here
I
am
and
*NL*
it
has
n't
,
of
course
,
but
the
main
point
is
that
this
time
I
was
n't
any
*NL*
more
afraid
of
it
than
I
had
been
when
I
was
a
Christian
Scientist
,
like
*NL*
I
was
last
year
.
So
now
I
know
I
'm
a
materialist
and
I
was
fraternizing
*NL*
with
the
hay
when
you
came
out
and
stood
by
the
woods
,
scared
to
death
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
you
little
wretch
--
''
cried
Amory
indignantly
.
``
Scared
of
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Yourself
!
_
''
she
shouted
,
and
he
jumped
.
She
clapped
her
hands
and
*NL*
laughed
.
``
See
--
see
!
Conscience

kill
it
like

``
But

objected

I

and
I
*NL*
wo

*NL*
*NL*
She
leaned
toward
him
,
her
burning
eyes
never
leaving
his
own
and
*NL*
whispered
with
a
sort
of
romantic
finality
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
so
,
Juan
,
I
feared
so
--
you
're
sentimental

You
're
not

I
'm
a
romantic
little
materialist
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
sentimental
--
I
'm
as
romantic
as
you
are
.
The
idea
,
you
know
,
is
*NL*
that
the
sentimental
person
thinks
things
will
last
--
the
romantic
*NL*
person
has
a
desperate
confidence
that
they
wo
n't

-LRB-
This
was
an
ancient
*NL*
distinction
of
Amory
's
.
-RRB-

``
Epigrams

I
'm

home

she
said
sadly
.
``
Let
's
get
off
the
haystack
*NL*
and
walk
to
the
cross-roads
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
slowly
descended
from
their
perch
.
She
would
not
let
him
help
her
*NL*
down
and
motioning
him
away
arrived
in
a
graceful
lump
in
the
soft
mud
*NL*
where
she
sat
for
an
instant
,
laughing
at
herself
.
Then
she
jumped
to
*NL*
her
feet
and
slipped
her
hand
into
his
,
and
they
tiptoed
across
the
*NL*
fields
,
jumping
and
swinging
from
dry
spot
to
dry
spot
.
A
transcendent
*NL*
delight
seemed
to
sparkle
in
every
pool
of
water
,
for
the
moon
had
risen
*NL*
and
the
storm
had
scurried
away
into
western
Maryland
.
When
Eleanor
's
*NL*
arm
touched
his
he
felt
his
hands
grow
cold
with
deadly
fear
lest
he
*NL*
should
lose
the
shadow
brush
with
which
his
imagination
was
painting
*NL*
wonders
of
her
.
He
watched
her
from
the
corners
of
his
eyes
as
ever
he
*NL*
did
when
he
walked
with
her
--
she
was
a
feast
and
a
folly
and
he
wished
*NL*
it
had
been
his
destiny
to
sit
forever
on
a
haystack
and
see
life
*NL*
through
her
green
eyes
.
His
paganism
soared
that
night
and
when
she
*NL*
faded
out
like
a
gray
ghost
down
the
road
,
a
deep
singing
came
out
*NL*
of
the
fields
and
filled
his
way
homeward
.
All
night
the
summer
moths
*NL*
flitted
in
and
out
of
Amory
's
window
;
all
night
large
looming
sounds
*NL*
swayed
in
mystic
revery
through
the
silver
grain
--
and
he
lay
awake
in
*NL*
the
clear
darkness

Amory
selected
a
blade
of
grass

nibbled
at
it
scientifically

*NL*
``

he

n't
possibly
have
a
summer
love
.
So
*NL*
many
people
have
tried
that
the
name
's
become
proverbial
.
Summer
is
*NL*
only
the
unfulfilled
promise
of
spring
,
a
charlatan
in
place
of
the
*NL*
warm
balmy
nights
I
dream
of
in
April
.
It
's
a
sad
season
of
life
without
*NL*
growth
...
It
has
no
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fourth
of
July
,
''
Amory
suggested
facetiously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
be
funny
!
''
she
said
,
raking
him
with
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
could
fulfil
the
promise
of
spring
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
thought
a
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
suppose
heaven
would
,
if
there
was
one
,
''
she
said
finally
,
``
a
*NL*
sort
of
pagan
heaven
--
you
ought
to
be
a
materialist
,
''
she
continued
*NL*
irrelevantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
you
look
a
good
deal
like
the
pictures
of
Rupert
Brooke
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
some
extent
Amory
tried
to
play
Rupert
Brooke
as
long
as
he
knew
*NL*
Eleanor
.
What
he
said
,
his
attitude
toward
life
,
toward
her
,
toward
*NL*
himself
,
were
all
reflexes
of
the
dead
Englishman
's
literary
moods
.
*NL*
Often
she
sat
in
the
grass
,
a
lazy
wind
playing
with
her
short
hair
,
*NL*
her
voice
husky
as
she
ran
up
and
down
the
scale
from
Grantchester
to
*NL*
Waikiki
.
There
was
something
most
passionate
in
Eleanor
's
reading
aloud
.
*NL*
They
seemed
nearer
,
not
only
mentally
,
but
physically
,
when
they
read
,
*NL*
than
when
she
was
in
his
arms
,
and
this
was
often
,
for
they
fell
half
*NL*
into
love
almost
from
the
first
.
Yet
was
Amory
capable
of
love
now
?
*NL*
He
could
,
as
always
,
run
through
the
emotions
in
a
half
hour
,
but
even
*NL*
while
they
revelled
in
their
imaginations
,
he
knew
that
neither
of
them
*NL*
could
care
as
he
had
cared
once
before
--
I
suppose
that
was
why
they
*NL*
turned
to
Brooke
,
and
Swinburne
,
and
Shelley
.
Their
chance
was
to
make
*NL*
everything
fine
and
finished
and
rich
and
imaginative
;
they
must
bend
*NL*
tiny
golden
tentacles
from
his
imagination
to
hers
,
that
would
take
the
*NL*
place
of
the
great
,
deep
love
that
was
never
so
near
,
yet
never
so
much
*NL*
of
a
dream
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
poem
they
read
over
and
over
;
Swinburne
's
``
Triumph
of
Time
,
''
and
*NL*
four
lines
of
it
rang
in
his
memory
afterward
on
warm
nights
when
he
saw
*NL*
the
fireflies
among
dusky
tree
trunks
and
heard
the
low
drone
of
many
*NL*
frogs
.
Then
Eleanor
seemed
to
come
out
of
the
night
and
stand
by
him
,
*NL*
and
he
heard
her
throaty
voice
,
with
its
tone
of
a
fleecy-headed
drum
,
*NL*
repeating
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
worth
a
tear
,
is
it
worth
an
hour
,
*NL*
To
think
of
things
that
are
well
outworn
;
*NL*
Of
fruitless
husk
and
fugitive
flower
,
*NL*
The
dream
foregone
and
the
deed
foreborne
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
formally
introduced
two
days
later
,
and
his
aunt
told
him
her
*NL*
history
.
The
Ramillys
were
two
:
old
Mr.
Ramilly
and
his
granddaughter
,
*NL*
Eleanor
.
She
had
lived
in
France
with
a
restless
mother
whom
Amory
*NL*
imagined
to
have
been
very
like
his
own
,
on
whose
death
she
had
come
to
*NL*
America
,
to
live
in
Maryland
.
She
had
gone
to
Baltimore
first
to
stay
*NL*
with
a
bachelor
uncle
,
and
there
she
insisted
on
being
a
debutante
at
*NL*
the
age
of
seventeen
.
She
had
a
wild
winter
and
arrived
in
the
*NL*
country
in
March
,
having
quarrelled
frantically
with
all
her
Baltimore
*NL*
relatives
,
and
shocked
them
into
fiery
protest
.
A
rather
fast
crowd
*NL*
had
come
out
,
who
drank
cocktails
in
limousines
and
were
promiscuously
*NL*
condescending
and
patronizing
toward
older
people
,
and
Eleanor
with
an
*NL*
esprit
that
hinted
strongly
of
the
boulevards
,
led
many
innocents
*NL*
still
redolent
of
St.
Timothy
's
and
Farmington
,
into
paths
of
Bohemian
*NL*
naughtiness
.
When
the
story
came
to
her
uncle
,
a
forgetful
cavalier
of
*NL*
a
more
hypocritical
era
,
there
was
a
scene
,
from
which
Eleanor
emerged
,
*NL*
subdued
but
rebellious
and
indignant
,
to
seek
haven
with
her
grandfather
*NL*
who
hovered
in
the
country
on
the
near
side
of
senility
.
That
's
as
far
*NL*
as
her
story
went
;
she
told
him
the
rest
herself
,
but
that
was
later
.
*NL*
*NL*
Often
they
swam
and
as
Amory
floated
lazily
in
the
water
he
shut
his
*NL*
mind
to
all
thoughts
except
those
of
hazy
soap-bubble
lands
where
the
*NL*
sun
splattered
through
wind-drunk
trees
.
How
could
any
one
possibly
*NL*
think
or
worry
,
or
do
anything
except
splash
and
dive
and
loll
there
*NL*
on
the
edge
of
time
while
the
flower
months
failed
.
Let
the
days
move
*NL*
over
--
sadness
and
memory
and
pain
recurred
outside
,
and
here
,
once
more
,
*NL*
before
he
went
on
to
meet
them
he
wanted
to
drift
and
be
young
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
days
when
Amory
resented
that
life
had
changed
from
an
even
*NL*
progress
along
a
road
stretching
ever
in
sight
,
with
the
scenery
merging
*NL*
and
blending
,
into
a
succession
of
quick
,
unrelated
scenes
--
two
years
of
*NL*
sweat
and
blood
,
that
sudden
absurd
instinct
for
paternity
that
Rosalind
*NL*
had
stirred
;
the
half-sensual
,
half-neurotic
quality
of
this
autumn
with
*NL*
Eleanor
.
He
felt
that
it
would
take
all
time
,
more
than
he
could
ever
*NL*
spare
,
to
glue
these
strange
cumbersome
pictures
into
the
scrap-book
of
*NL*
his
life
.
It
was
all
like
a
banquet
where
he
sat
for
this
half-hour
of
*NL*
his
youth
and
tried
to
enjoy
brilliant
epicurean
courses
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dimly
he
promised
himself
a
time
where
all
should
be
welded
together
.
*NL*
For
months
it
seemed
that
he
had
alternated
between
being
borne
along
a
*NL*
stream
of
love
or
fascination
,
or
left
in
an
eddy
,
and
in
the
eddies
*NL*
he
had
not
desired
to
think
,
rather
to
be
picked
up
on
a
wave
's
top
and
*NL*
swept
along
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
despairing
,
dying
autumn
and
our
love
--
how
well
they
harmonize
!
''
*NL*
said
Eleanor
sadly
one
day
as
they
lay
dripping
by
the
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Indian
summer
of
our
hearts
--
''
he
ceased
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
,
''
she
said
finally
,
``
was
she
light
or
dark
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Light
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
she
more
beautiful
than
I
am
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
said
Amory
shortly
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
night
they
walked
while
the
moon
rose
and
poured
a
great
burden
of
*NL*
glory
over
the
garden
until
it
seemed
fairyland
with
Amory
and
Eleanor
,
*NL*
dim
phantasmal
shapes
,
expressing
eternal
beauty
in
curious
elfin
love
*NL*
moods
.
Then
they
turned
out
of
the
moonlight
into
the
trellised
darkness
*NL*
of
a
vine-hung
pagoda
,
where
there
were
scents
so
plaintive
as
to
be
*NL*
nearly
musical
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Light
a
match
,
''
she
whispered
.
``
I
want
to
see
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Scratch
!
Flare
!
*NL*
*NL*
The
night
and
the
scarred
trees
were
like
scenery
in
a
play
,
and
to
be
*NL*
there
with
Eleanor
,
shadowy
and
unreal
,
seemed
somehow
oddly
familiar
.
*NL*
Amory
thought
how
it
was
only
the
past
that
ever
seemed
strange
and
*NL*
unbelievable
.
The
match
went
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
black
as
pitch
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
're
just
voices
now
,
''
murmured
Eleanor
,
``
little
lonesome
voices
.
*NL*
Light
another
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
was
my
last
match
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
he
caught
her
in
his
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
_
are
_
mine
--
you
know
you
're
mine
!
''
he
cried
wildly
...
the
moonlight
*NL*
twisted
in
through
the
vines
and
listened
...
the
fireflies
hung
upon
*NL*
their
whispers
as
if
to
win
his
glance
from
the
glory
of
their
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
*****
*NL*
*NL*
THE
END
OF
SUMMER
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
wind
is
stirring
in
the
grass
;
not
one
wind
stirs
...
the
water
*NL*
in
the
hidden
pools
,
as
glass
,
fronts
the
full
moon
and
so
inters
*NL*
the
golden
token
in
its
icy
mass
,
''
chanted
Eleanor
to
the
trees
that
*NL*
skeletoned
the
body
of
the
night
.
``
Is
n't
it
ghostly
here
?
If
you
can
*NL*
hold
your
horse
's
feet
up
,
let
's
cut
through
the
woods
and
find
the
*NL*
hidden
pools
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
after
one
,
and
you
'll
get
the
devil
,
''
he
objected
,
``
and
I
do
n't
*NL*
know
enough
about
horses
to
put
one
away
in
the
pitch
dark
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shut
up
,
you
old
fool
,
''
she
whispered
irrelevantly
,
and
,
leaning
over
,
*NL*
she
patted
him
lazily
with
her
riding-crop
.
``
You
can
leave
your
old
plug
*NL*
in
our
stable
and
I
'll
send
him
over
to-morrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
my
uncle
has
got
to
drive
me
to
the
station
with
this
old
plug
at
*NL*
seven
o'clock
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
be
a
spoil-sport
--
remember
,
you
have
a
tendency
toward
wavering
*NL*
that
prevents
you
from
being
the
entire
light
of
my
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
drew
his
horse
up
close
beside
,
and
,
leaning
toward
her
,
grasped
*NL*
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
I
am
--
_
quick
_
,
or
I
'll
pull
you
over
and
make
you
ride
behind
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
up
and
smiled
and
shook
her
head
excitedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
do
!
--
or
rather
,
do
n't
!
Why
are
all
the
exciting
things
so
*NL*
uncomfortable
,
like
fighting
and
exploring
and
ski-ing
in
Canada
?
By
*NL*
the
way
,
we
're
going
to
ride
up
Harper
's
Hill
.
I
think
that
comes
in
our
*NL*
programme
about
five
o'clock
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
little
devil
,
''
Amory
growled
.
``
You
're
going
to
make
me
stay
up
all
*NL*
night
and
sleep
in
the
train
like
an
immigrant
all
day
to-morrow
,
going
*NL*
back
to
New
York
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hush
!
some
one
's
coming
along
the
road
--
let
's
go
!
Whoo-ee-oop
!
''
And
*NL*
with
a
shout
that
probably
gave
the
belated
traveller
a
series
of
*NL*
shivers
,
she
turned
her
horse
into
the
woods
and
Amory
followed
slowly
,
*NL*
as
he
had
followed
her
all
day
for
three
weeks
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
summer
was
over
,
but
he
had
spent
the
days
in
watching
Eleanor
,
a
*NL*
graceful
,
facile
Manfred
,
build
herself
intellectual
and
imaginative
*NL*
pyramids
while
she
revelled
in
the
artificialities
of
the
temperamental
*NL*
teens
and
they
wrote
poetry
at
the
dinner-table
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
Vanity
kissed
Vanity
,
a
hundred
happy
Junes
ago
,
he
*NL*
pondered
o'er
her
breathlessly
,
and
,
that
all
men
might
ever
*NL*
know
,
he
rhymed
her
eyes
with
life
and
death
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thru
Time
I
'll
save
my
love
!
''
he
said
...
yet
Beauty
*NL*
vanished
with
his
breath
,
and
,
with
her
lovers
,
she
was
dead
...
*NL*
*NL*
--
Ever
his
wit
and
not
her
eyes
,
ever
his
art
and
not
her
hair
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
'd
learn
a
trick
in
rhyme
,
be
wise
and
pause
before
his
*NL*
sonnet
there
''
...
So
all
my
words
,
however
true
,
might
sing
*NL*
you
to
a
thousandth
June
,
and
no
one
ever
_
know
_
that
you
were
*NL*
Beauty
for
an
afternoon
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
So
he
wrote
one
day
,
when
he
pondered
how
coldly
we
thought
of
the
``
Dark
*NL*
Lady
of
the
Sonnets
,
''
and
how
little
we
remembered
her
as
the
great
man
*NL*
wanted
her
remembered
.
For
what
Shakespeare
_
must
_
have
desired
,
to
have
*NL*
been
able
to
write
with
such
divine
despair
,
was
that
the
lady
should
*NL*
live
...
and
now
we
have
no
real
interest
in
her
...
The
irony
of
it
is
*NL*
that
if
he
had
cared
_
more
_
for
the
poem
than
for
the
lady
the
sonnet
*NL*
would
be
only
obvious
,
imitative
rhetoric
and
no
one
would
ever
have
*NL*
read
it
after
twenty
years
...
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
last
night
Amory
ever
saw
Eleanor
.
He
was
leaving
in
the
*NL*
morning
and
they
had
agreed
to
take
a
long
farewell
trot
by
the
cold
*NL*
moonlight
.
She
wanted
to
talk
,
she
said
--
perhaps
the
last
time
in
her
*NL*
life
that
she
could
be
rational
-LRB-
she
meant
pose
with
comfort
-RRB-
.
So
they
*NL*
had
turned
into
the
woods
and
rode
for
half
an
hour
with
scarcely
*NL*
a
word
,
except
when
she
whispered
``
Damn
!
''
at
a
bothersome
*NL*
branch
--
whispered
it
as
no
other
girl
was
ever
able
to
whisper
it
.
Then
*NL*
they
started
up
Harper
's
Hill
,
walking
their
tired
horses
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
Lord
!
It
's
quiet
here
!
''
whispered
Eleanor
;
``
much
more
lonesome
*NL*
than
the
woods
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hate
woods
,
''
Amory
said
,
shuddering
.
``
Any
kind
of
foliage
or
*NL*
underbrush
at
night
.
Out
here
it
's
so
broad
and
easy
on
the
spirit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
long
slope
of
a
long
hill
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
the
cold
moon
rolling
moonlight
down
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
thee
and
me
,
last
and
most
important
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
quiet
that
night
--
the
straight
road
they
followed
up
to
the
edge
*NL*
of
the
cliff
knew
few
footsteps
at
any
time
.
Only
an
occasional
negro
*NL*
cabin
,
silver-gray
in
the
rock-ribbed
moonlight
,
broke
the
long
line
of
*NL*
bare
ground
;
behind
lay
the
black
edge
of
the
woods
like
a
dark
frosting
*NL*
on
white
cake
,
and
ahead
the
sharp
,
high
horizon
.
It
was
much
colder
--
so
*NL*
cold
that
it
settled
on
them
and
drove
all
the
warm
nights
from
their
*NL*
minds
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
end
of
summer
,
''
said
Eleanor
softly
.
``
Listen
to
the
beat
of
our
*NL*
horses
'
hoofs
--
`
tump-tump-tump-a-tump
.
'
Have
you
ever
been
feverish
*NL*
and
had
all
noises
divide
into
`
tump-tump-tump
'
until
you
could
swear
*NL*
eternity
was
divisible
into
so
many
tumps
?
That
's
the
way
I
feel
--
old
*NL*
horses
go
tump-tump
...
I
guess
that
's
the
only
thing
that
separates
*NL*
horses
and
clocks
from
us
.
Human
beings
ca
n't
go
`
tump-tump-tump
'
*NL*
without
going
crazy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
breeze
freshened
and
Eleanor
pulled
her
cape
around
her
and
*NL*
shivered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
very
cold
?
''
asked
Amory
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
'm
thinking
about
myself
--
my
black
old
inside
self
,
the
real
one
,
*NL*
with
the
fundamental
honesty
that
keeps
me
from
being
absolutely
wicked
*NL*
by
making
me
realize
my
own
sins
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
riding
up
close
by
the
cliff
and
Amory
gazed
over
.
Where
the
*NL*
fall
met
the
ground
a
hundred
feet
below
,
a
black
stream
made
a
sharp
*NL*
line
,
broken
by
tiny
glints
in
the
swift
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rotten
,
rotten
old
world
,
''
broke
out
Eleanor
suddenly
,
``
and
the
*NL*
wretchedest
thing
of
all
is
me
--
oh
,
_
why
_
am
I
a
girl
?
Why
am
I
not
a
*NL*
stupid
--
?
Look
at
you
;
you
're
stupider
than
I
am
,
not
much
,
but
some
,
*NL*
and
you
can
lope
about
and
get
bored
and
then
lope
somewhere
else
,
*NL*
and
you
can
play
around
with
girls
without
being
involved
in
meshes
of
*NL*
sentiment
,
and
you
can
do
anything
and
be
justified
--
and
here
am
I
with
*NL*
the
brains
to
do
everything
,
yet
tied
to
the
sinking
ship
of
future
*NL*
matrimony
.
If
I
were
born
a
hundred
years
from
now
,
well
and
good
,
but
*NL*
now
what
's
in
store
for
me
--
I
have
to
marry
,
that
goes
without
saying
.
*NL*
Who
?
I
'm
too
bright
for
most
men
,
and
yet
I
have
to
descend
to
their
*NL*
level
and
let
them
patronize
my
intellect
in
order
to
get
their
*NL*
attention
.
Every
year
that
I
do
n't
marry
I
've
got
less
chance
for
a
*NL*
first-class
man
.
At
the
best
I
can
have
my
choice
from
one
or
two
cities
*NL*
and
,
of
course
,
I
have
to
marry
into
a
dinner-coat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
,
''
she
leaned
close
again
,
``
I
like
clever
men
and
good-looking
*NL*
men
,
and
,
of
course
,
no
one
cares
more
for
personality
than
I
do
.
Oh
,
*NL*
just
one
person
in
fifty
has
any
glimmer
of
what
sex
is
.
I
'm
hipped
on
*NL*
Freud
and
all
that
,
but
it
's
rotten
that
every
bit
of
_
real
_
love
in
*NL*
the
world
is
ninety-nine
per
cent
passion
and
one
little
soupcon
of
*NL*
jealousy
.
''
She
finished
as
suddenly
as
she
began
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
,
you
're
right
,
''
Amory
agreed
.
``
It
's
a
rather
unpleasant
*NL*
overpowering
force
that
's
part
of
the
machinery
under
everything
.
It
's
*NL*
like
an
actor
that
lets
you
see
his
mechanics
!
Wait
a
minute
till
I
*NL*
think
this
out
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
paused
and
tried
to
get
a
metaphor
.
They
had
turned
the
cliff
and
*NL*
were
riding
along
the
road
about
fifty
feet
to
the
left
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
every
one
's
got
to
have
some
cloak
to
throw
around
it
.
The
*NL*
mediocre
intellects
,
Plato
's
second
class
,
use
the
remnants
of
romantic
*NL*
chivalry
diluted
with
Victorian
sentiment
--
and
we
who
consider
ourselves
*NL*
the
intellectuals
cover
it
up
by
pretending
that
it
's
another
side
of
*NL*
us
,
has
nothing
to
do
with
our
shining
brains
;
we
pretend
that
the
fact
*NL*
that
we
realize
it
is
really
absolving
us
from
being
a
prey
to
it
.
But
*NL*
the
truth
is
that
sex
is
right
in
the
middle
of
our
purest
abstractions
,
*NL*
so
close
that
it
obscures
vision
...
I
can
kiss
you
now
and
will
.
...
''
*NL*
He
leaned
toward
her
in
his
saddle
,
but
she
drew
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
--
I
ca
n't
kiss
you
now
--
I
'm
more
sensitive
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
more
stupid
then
,
''
he
declared
rather
impatiently
.
``
Intellect
is
*NL*
no
protection
from
sex
any
more
than
convention
is
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
?
''
she
fired
up
.
``
The
Catholic
Church
or
the
maxims
of
*NL*
Confucius
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
looked
up
,
rather
taken
aback
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
your
panacea
,
is
n't
it
?
''
she
cried
.
``
Oh
,
you
're
just
an
old
*NL*
hypocrite
,
too
.
Thousands
of
scowling
priests
keeping
the
degenerate
*NL*
Italians
and
illiterate
Irish
repentant
with
gabble-gabble
about
the
*NL*
sixth
and
ninth
commandments
.
It
's
just
all
cloaks
,
sentiment
and
*NL*
spiritual
rouge
and
panaceas
.
I
'll
tell
you
there
is
no
God
,
not
even
*NL*
a
definite
abstract
goodness
;
so
it
's
all
got
to
be
worked
out
for
the
*NL*
individual
by
the
individual
here
in
high
white
foreheads
like
mine
,
and
*NL*
you
're
too
much
the
prig
to
admit
it
.
''
She
let
go
her
reins
and
shook
*NL*
her
little
fists
at
the
stars
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
there
's
a
God
let
him
strike
me
--
strike
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Talking
about
God
again
after
the
manner
of
atheists
,
''
Amory
said
*NL*
sharply
.
His
materialism
,
always
a
thin
cloak
,
was
torn
to
shreds
by
*NL*
Eleanor
's
blasphemy
...
She
knew
it
and
it
angered
him
that
she
knew
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
like
most
intellectuals
who
do
n't
find
faith
convenient
,
''
he
*NL*
continued
coldly
,
``
like
Napoleon
and
Oscar
Wilde
and
the
rest
of
your
*NL*
type
,
you
'll
yell
loudly
for
a
priest
on
your
death-bed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Eleanor
drew
her
horse
up
sharply
and
he
reined
in
beside
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
I
?
''
she
said
in
a
queer
voice
that
scared
him
.
``
Will
I
?
Watch
!
*NL*
_
I
'm
going
over
the
cliff
!
_
''
And
before
he
could
interfere
she
had
*NL*
turned
and
was
riding
breakneck
for
the
end
of
the
plateau
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
wheeled
and
started
after
her
,
his
body
like
ice
,
his
nerves
in
a
*NL*
vast
clangor
.
There
was
no
chance
of
stopping
her
.
The
moon
was
under
a
*NL*
cloud
and
her
horse
would
step
blindly
over
.
Then
some
ten
feet
from
*NL*
the
edge
of
the
cliff
she
gave
a
sudden
shriek
and
flung
herself
*NL*
sideways
--
plunged
from
her
horse
and
,
rolling
over
twice
,
landed
in
*NL*
a
pile
of
brush
five
feet
from
the
edge
.
The
horse
went
over
with
a
*NL*
frantic
whinny
.
In
a
minute
he
was
by
Eleanor
's
side
and
saw
that
her
*NL*
eyes
were
open
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eleanor
!
''
he
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
answer
,
but
her
lips
moved
and
her
eyes
filled
with
sudden
*NL*
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eleanor
,
are
you
hurt
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
I
do
n't
think
so
,
''
she
said
faintly
,
and
then
began
weeping
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
horse
dead
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
God
--
Yes
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
she
wailed
.
``
I
thought
I
was
going
over
.
I
did
n't
know
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
helped
her
gently
to
her
feet
and
boosted
her
onto
his
saddle
.
So
*NL*
they
started
homeward
;
Amory
walking
and
she
bent
forward
on
the
pommel
,
*NL*
sobbing
bitterly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
got
a
crazy
streak
,
''
she
faltered
,
``
twice
before
I
've
done
things
*NL*
like
that
.
When
I
was
eleven
mother
went
--
went
mad
--
stark
raving
crazy
.
*NL*
We
were
in
Vienna
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
way
back
she
talked
haltingly
about
herself
,
and
Amory
's
love
*NL*
waned
slowly
with
the
moon
.
At
her
door
they
started
from
habit
to
kiss
*NL*
good
night
,
but
she
could
not
run
into
his
arms
,
nor
were
they
stretched
*NL*
to
meet
her
as
in
the
week
before
.
For
a
minute
they
stood
there
,
hating
*NL*
each
other
with
a
bitter
sadness
.
But
as
Amory
had
loved
himself
in
*NL*
Eleanor
,
so
now
what
he
hated
was
only
a
mirror
.
Their
poses
were
strewn
*NL*
about
the
pale
dawn
like
broken
glass
.
The
stars
were
long
gone
and
*NL*
there
were
left
only
the
little
sighing
gusts
of
wind
and
the
silences
*NL*
between
...
but
naked
souls
are
poor
things
ever
,
and
soon
he
turned
*NL*
homeward
and
let
new
lights
come
in
with
the
sun
.

CHAPTER
4
.
The
Supercilious
Sacrifice
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Atlantic
City
.
Amory
paced
the
board
walk
at
day
's
end
,
lulled
by
the
*NL*
everlasting
surge
of
changing
waves
,
smelling
the
half-mournful
odor
of
*NL*
the
salt
breeze
.
The
sea
,
he
thought
,
had
treasured
its
memories
deeper
*NL*
than
the
faithless
land
.
It
seemed
still
to
whisper
of
Norse
galleys
*NL*
ploughing
the
water
world
under
raven-figured
flags
,
of
the
British
*NL*
dreadnoughts
,
gray
bulwarks
of
civilization
steaming
up
through
the
fog
*NL*
of
one
dark
July
into
the
North
Sea
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
Amory
Blaine
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
looked
down
into
the
street
below
.
A
low
racing
car
had
drawn
to
a
*NL*
stop
and
a
familiar
cheerful
face
protruded
from
the
driver
's
seat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
on
down
,
goopher
!
''
cried
Alec
.
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
called
a
greeting
and
descending
a
flight
of
wooden
steps
*NL*
approached
the
car
.
He
and
Alec
had
been
meeting
intermittently
,
but
the
*NL*
barrier
of
Rosalind
lay
always
between
them
.
He
was
sorry
for
this
;
he
*NL*
hated
to
lose
Alec
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Blaine
,
this
is
Miss
Waterson
,
Miss
Wayne
,
and
Mr.
Tully
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
d'
y
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Amory
,
''
said
Alec
exuberantly
,
``
if
you
'll
jump
in
we
'll
take
you
to
*NL*
some
secluded
nook
and
give
you
a
wee
jolt
of
Bourbon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
considered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
an
idea
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Step
in
--
move
over
,
Jill
,
and
Amory
will
smile
very
handsomely
at
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
squeezed
into
the
back
seat
beside
a
gaudy
,
vermilion-lipped
*NL*
blonde
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hello
,
Doug
Fairbanks
,
''
she
said
flippantly
.
``
Walking
for
exercise
or
*NL*
hunting
for
company
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
counting
the
waves
,
''
replied
Amory
gravely
.
``
I
'm
going
in
for
*NL*
statistics
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
kid
me
,
Doug
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
reached
an
unfrequented
side
street
Alec
stopped
the
car
among
*NL*
deep
shadows
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
you
doing
down
here
these
cold
days
,
Amory
?
''
he
demanded
,
as
he
*NL*
produced
a
quart
of
Bourbon
from
under
the
fur
rug
.
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
avoided
the
question
.
Indeed
,
he
had
had
no
definite
reason
for
*NL*
coming
to
the
coast
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
remember
that
party
of
ours
,
sophomore
year
?
''
he
asked
instead
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
I
?
When
we
slept
in
the
pavilions
up
in
Asbury
Park
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lord
,
Alec
!
It
's
hard
to
think
that
Jesse
and
Dick
and
Kerry
are
all
*NL*
three
dead
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alec
shivered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
talk
about
it
.
These
dreary
fall
days
depress
me
enough
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jill
seemed
to
agree
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Doug
here
is
sorta
gloomy
anyways
,
''
she
commented
.
``
Tell
him
to
drink
*NL*
deep
--
it
's
good
and
scarce
these
days
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
I
really
want
to
ask
you
,
Amory
,
is
where
you
are
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
New
York
,
I
suppose
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
mean
to-night
,
because
if
you
have
n't
got
a
room
yet
you
'd
better
*NL*
help
me
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Glad
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
Tully
and
I
have
two
rooms
with
bath
between
at
the
Ranier
,
*NL*
and
he
's
got
to
go
back
to
New
York
.
I
do
n't
want
to
have
to
move
.
*NL*
Question
is
,
will
you
occupy
one
of
the
rooms
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
was
willing
,
if
he
could
get
in
right
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
find
the
key
in
the
office
;
the
rooms
are
in
my
name
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Declining
further
locomotion
or
further
stimulation
,
Amory
left
the
car
*NL*
and
sauntered
back
along
the
board
walk
to
the
hotel
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
in
an
eddy
again
,
a
deep
,
lethargic
gulf
,
without
desire
to
work
*NL*
or
write
,
love
or
dissipate
.
For
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
rather
*NL*
longed
for
death
to
roll
over
his
generation
,
obliterating
their
petty
*NL*
fevers
and
struggles
and
exultations
.
His
youth
seemed
never
so
vanished
*NL*
as
now
in
the
contrast
between
the
utter
loneliness
of
this
visit
and
*NL*
that
riotous
,
joyful
party
of
four
years
before
.
Things
that
had
been
*NL*
the
merest
commonplaces
of
his
life
then
,
deep
sleep
,
the
sense
of
*NL*
beauty
around
him
,
all
desire
,
had
flown
away
and
the
gaps
they
left
*NL*
were
filled
only
with
the
great
listlessness
of
his
disillusion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
hold
a
man
a
woman
has
to
appeal
to
the
worst
in
him
.
''
This
sentence
*NL*
was
the
thesis
of
most
of
his
bad
nights
,
of
which
he
felt
this
was
to
*NL*
be
one
.
His
mind
had
already
started
to
play
variations
on
the
subject
.
*NL*
Tireless
passion
,
fierce
jealousy
,
longing
to
possess
and
crush
--
these
*NL*
alone
were
left
of
all
his
love
for
Rosalind
;
these
remained
to
him
as
*NL*
payment
for
the
loss
of
his
youth
--
bitter
calomel
under
the
thin
sugar
*NL*
of
love
's
exaltation
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
his
room
he
undressed
and
wrapping
himself
in
blankets
to
keep
out
*NL*
the
chill
October
air
drowsed
in
an
armchair
by
the
open
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
remembered
a
poem
he
had
read
months
before
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
staunch
old
heart
who
toiled
so
long
for
me
,
*NL*
I
waste
my
years
sailing
along
the
sea
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
he
had
no
sense
of
waste
,
no
sense
of
the
present
hope
that
waste
*NL*
implied
.
He
felt
that
life
had
rejected
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rosalind
!
Rosalind
!
''
He
poured
the
words
softly
into
the
half-darkness
*NL*
until
she
seemed
to
permeate
the
room
;
the
wet
salt
breeze
filled
*NL*
his
hair
with
moisture
,
the
rim
of
a
moon
seared
the
sky
and
made
the
*NL*
curtains
dim
and
ghostly
.
He
fell
asleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
awoke
it
was
very
late
and
quiet
.
The
blanket
had
slipped
partly
*NL*
off
his
shoulders
and
he
touched
his
skin
to
find
it
damp
and
cold
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
became
aware
of
a
tense
whispering
not
ten
feet
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
became
rigid
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
make
a
sound
!
''
It
was
Alec
's
voice
.
``
Jill
--
do
you
hear
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
''
breathed
very
low
,
very
frightened
.
They
were
in
the
bathroom
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
his
ears
caught
a
louder
sound
from
somewhere
along
the
corridor
*NL*
outside
.
It
was
a
mumbling
of
men
's
voices
and
a
repeated
muffled
*NL*
rapping
.
Amory
threw
off
the
blankets
and
moved
close
to
the
bathroom
*NL*
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
God
!
''
came
the
girl
's
voice
again
.
``
You
'll
have
to
let
them
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sh
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
a
steady
,
insistent
knocking
began
at
Amory
's
hall
door
*NL*
and
simultaneously
out
of
the
bathroom
came
Alec
,
followed
by
the
*NL*
vermilion-lipped
girl
.
They
were
both
clad
in
pajamas
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Amory
!
''
an
anxious
whisper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
trouble
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
house
detectives
.
My
God
,
Amory
--
they
're
just
looking
for
a
*NL*
test-case
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
better
let
them
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
understand
.
They
can
get
me
under
the
Mann
Act
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
girl
followed
him
slowly
,
a
rather
miserable
,
pathetic
figure
in
the
*NL*
darkness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
tried
to
plan
quickly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
make
a
racket
and
let
them
in
your
room
,
''
he
suggested
anxiously
,
*NL*
``
and
I
'll
get
her
out
by
this
door
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
're
here
too
,
though
.
They
'll
watch
this
door
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ca
n't
you
give
a
wrong
name
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
chance
.
I
registered
under
my
own
name
;
besides
,
they
'd
trail
the
*NL*
auto
license
number
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
you
're
married
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jill
says
one
of
the
house
detectives
knows
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
girl
had
stolen
to
the
bed
and
tumbled
upon
it
;
lay
there
listening
*NL*
wretchedly
to
the
knocking
which
had
grown
gradually
to
a
pounding
.
Then
*NL*
came
a
man
's
voice
,
angry
and
imperative
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Open
up
or
we
'll
break
the
door
in
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
silence
when
this
voice
ceased
Amory
realized
that
there
were
*NL*
other
things
in
the
room
besides
people
...
over
and
around
the
figure
*NL*
crouched
on
the
bed
there
hung
an
aura
,
gossamer
as
a
moonbeam
,
tainted
*NL*
as
stale
,
weak
wine
,
yet
a
horror
,
diffusively
brooding
already
over
*NL*
the
three
of
them
...
and
over
by
the
window
among
the
stirring
curtains
*NL*
stood
something
else
,
featureless
and
indistinguishable
,
yet
strangely
*NL*
familiar
...
Simultaneously
two
great
cases
presented
themselves
side
by
*NL*
side
to
Amory
;
all
that
took
place
in
his
mind
,
then
,
occupied
in
actual
*NL*
time
less
than
ten
seconds
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
fact
that
flashed
radiantly
on
his
comprehension
was
the
great
*NL*
impersonality
of
sacrifice
--
he
perceived
that
what
we
call
love
and
*NL*
hate
,
reward
and
punishment
,
had
no
more
to
do
with
it
than
the
date
*NL*
of
the
month
.
He
quickly
recapitulated
the
story
of
a
sacrifice
he
had
*NL*
heard
of
in
college
:
a
man
had
cheated
in
an
examination
;
his
roommate
*NL*
in
a
gust
of
sentiment
had
taken
the
entire
blame
--
due
to
the
shame
*NL*
of
it
the
innocent
one
's
entire
future
seemed
shrouded
in
regret
and
*NL*
failure
,
capped
by
the
ingratitude
of
the
real
culprit
.
He
had
finally
*NL*
taken
his
own
life
--
years
afterward
the
facts
had
come
out
.
At
the
time
*NL*
the
story
had
both
puzzled
and
worried
Amory
.
Now
he
realized
the
truth
;
*NL*
that
sacrifice
was
no
purchase
of
freedom
.
It
was
like
a
great
elective
*NL*
office
,
it
was
like
an
inheritance
of
power
--
to
certain
people
at
*NL*
certain
times
an
essential
luxury
,
carrying
with
it
not
a
guarantee
but
*NL*
a
responsibility
,
not
a
security
but
an
infinite
risk
.
Its
very
momentum
*NL*
might
drag
him
down
to
ruin
--
the
passing
of
the
emotional
wave
that
made
*NL*
it
possible
might
leave
the
one
who
made
it
high
and
dry
forever
on
an
*NL*
island
of
despair
.
*NL*
*NL*
...
Amory
knew
that
afterward
Alec
would
secretly
hate
him
for
having
*NL*
done
so
much
for
him
...
*NL*
*NL*
...
All
this
was
flung
before
Amory
like
an
opened
scroll
,
while
*NL*
ulterior
to
him
and
speculating
upon
him
were
those
two
breathless
,
*NL*
listening
forces
:
the
gossamer
aura
that
hung
over
and
about
the
girl
*NL*
and
that
familiar
thing
by
the
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sacrifice
by
its
very
nature
was
arrogant
and
impersonal
;
sacrifice
*NL*
should
be
eternally
supercilious
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
Weep
not
for
me
but
for
thy
children
.
_
*NL*
*NL*
That
--
thought
Amory
--
would
be
somehow
the
way
God
would
talk
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
felt
a
sudden
surge
of
joy
and
then
like
a
face
in
a
*NL*
motion-picture
the
aura
over
the
bed
faded
out
;
the
dynamic
shadow
*NL*
by
the
window
,
that
was
as
near
as
he
could
name
it
,
remained
for
the
*NL*
fraction
of
a
moment
and
then
the
breeze
seemed
to
lift
it
swiftly
out
*NL*
of
the
room
.
He
clinched
his
hands
in
quick
ecstatic
excitement
...
the
*NL*
ten
seconds
were
up
...
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
what
I
say
,
Alec
--
do
what
I
say
.
Do
you
understand
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alec
looked
at
him
dumbly
--
his
face
a
tableau
of
anguish
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
a
family
,
''
continued
Amory
slowly
.
``
You
have
a
family
and
it
's
*NL*
important
that
you
should
get
out
of
this
.
Do
you
hear
me
?
''
He
repeated
*NL*
clearly
what
he
had
said
.
``
Do
you
hear
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hear
you
.
''
The
voice
was
curiously
strained
,
the
eyes
never
for
a
*NL*
second
left
Amory
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alec
,
you
're
going
to
lie
down
here
.
If
any
one
comes
in
you
act
drunk
.
*NL*
You
do
what
I
say
--
if
you
do
n't
I
'll
probably
kill
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
another
moment
while
they
stared
at
each
other
.
Then
Amory
*NL*
went
briskly
to
the
bureau
and
,
taking
his
pocket-book
,
beckoned
*NL*
peremptorily
to
the
girl
.
He
heard
one
word
from
Alec
that
sounded
like
*NL*
``
penitentiary
,
''
then
he
and
Jill
were
in
the
bathroom
with
the
door
*NL*
bolted
behind
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
here
with
me
,
''
he
said
sternly
.
``
You
've
been
with
me
all
*NL*
evening
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
nodded
,
gave
a
little
half
cry
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
second
he
had
the
door
of
the
other
room
open
and
three
men
*NL*
entered
.
There
was
an
immediate
flood
of
electric
light
and
he
stood
*NL*
there
blinking
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
been
playing
a
little
too
dangerous
a
game
,
young
man
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
leader
of
the
trio
nodded
authoritatively
at
a
burly
man
in
a
check
*NL*
suit
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
Olson
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
got
you
,
Mr.
O'May
,
''
said
Olson
,
nodding
.
The
other
two
took
a
*NL*
curious
glance
at
their
quarry
and
then
withdrew
,
closing
the
door
*NL*
angrily
behind
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
burly
man
regarded
Amory
contemptuously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
n't
you
ever
hear
of
the
Mann
Act
?
Coming
down
here
with
her
,
''
he
*NL*
indicated
the
girl
with
his
thumb
,
``
with
a
New
York
license
on
your
*NL*
car
--
to
a
hotel
like
_
this
_
.
''
He
shook
his
head
implying
that
he
had
*NL*
struggled
over
Amory
but
now
gave
him
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Amory
rather
impatiently
,
``
what
do
you
want
us
to
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Get
dressed
,
quick
--
and
tell
your
friend
not
to
make
such
a
racket
.
''
*NL*
Jill
was
sobbing
noisily
on
the
bed
,
but
at
these
words
she
subsided
*NL*
sulkily
and
,
gathering
up
her
clothes
,
retired
to
the
bathroom
.
As
Amory
*NL*
slipped
into
Alec
's
B.
V.
D.
's
he
found
that
his
attitude
toward
the
*NL*
situation
was
agreeably
humorous
.
The
aggrieved
virtue
of
the
burly
man
*NL*
made
him
want
to
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anybody
else
here
?
''
demanded
Olson
,
trying
to
look
keen
and
*NL*
ferret-like
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fellow
who
had
the
rooms
,
''
said
Amory
carelessly
.
``
He
's
drunk
as
an
*NL*
owl
,
though
.
Been
in
there
asleep
since
six
o'clock
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
take
a
look
at
him
presently
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
did
you
find
out
?
''
asked
Amory
curiously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Night
clerk
saw
you
go
up-stairs
with
this
woman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
nodded
;
Jill
reappeared
from
the
bathroom
,
completely
if
rather
*NL*
untidily
arrayed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
then
,
''
began
Olson
,
producing
a
note-book
,
``
I
want
your
real
*NL*
names
--
no
damn
John
Smith
or
Mary
Brown
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait
a
minute
,
''
said
Amory
quietly
.
``
Just
drop
that
big-bully
stuff
.
We
*NL*
merely
got
caught
,
that
's
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Olson
glared
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Name
?
''
he
snapped
.
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
gave
his
name
and
New
York
address
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
the
lady
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Jill
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
,
''
cried
Olson
indignantly
,
``
just
ease
up
on
the
nursery
rhymes
.
*NL*
What
's
your

?
Sarah
Murphy
?

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
God

''
cried
the
girl
cupping
her
tear-stained
face
in
her
hands
.
*NL*
``
I
do

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
Shut
up

cried
Amory
at
Olson
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
instant
's
pause
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stella
Robbins
,
''
she
faltered
finally
.
``
General
Delivery
,
Rugway
,
New
*NL*

''
*NL*
*NL*
Olson
snapped
his
note-book
shut
and
looked
at
them
very
ponderously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
rights
the
hotel
could
turn
the
evidence
over
to
the
police
and
*NL*
you
'd
go
to
penitentiary
,
you
would
,
for
bringin
'
a
girl
from
one
State
*NL*
to
`
nother
f
'
r
immoral
purp
`
ses
--
''
He
paused
to
let
the
majesty
of
his
*NL*
words
sink
in
.
``
But
--
the
hotel
is
going
to
let
you
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
does
n't
want
to
get
in
the
papers
,
''
cried
Jill
fiercely
.
``
Let
us
*NL*
off
!
Huh
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
great
lightness
surrounded
Amory
.
He
realized
that
he
was
safe
and
*NL*
only
then
did
he
appreciate
the
full
enormity
of
what
he
might
have
*NL*
incurred
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
However
,
''
continued
Olson
,
``
there
's
a
protective
association
among
the
*NL*
hotels
.
There
's
been
too
much
of
this
stuff
,
and
we
got
a
`
rangement
*NL*
with
the
newspapers
so
that
you
get
a
little
free
publicity
.
Not
the
*NL*
name
of
the
hotel
,
but
just
a
line
sayin

that
you
had
a
little
trouble
*NL*
in

City

See
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see

off

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
on
,
''
said
Amory
briskly
.
``
Let
's
get
out
of
here
.
We
do
n't
need
a
*NL*
valedictory
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Olson
walked
through
the
bathroom
and
took
a
cursory
glance
at
Alec
's
*NL*
still
form
.
Then
he
extinguished
the
lights
and
motioned
them
to
follow
*NL*
him
.
As
they
walked
into
the
elevator
Amory
considered
a
piece
of
*NL*
bravado
--
yielded
finally
.
He
reached
out
and
tapped
Olson
on
the
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
you
mind
taking
off
your
hat
?
There
's
a
lady
in
the
elevator
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Olson
's
hat
came
off
slowly
.
There
was
a
rather
embarrassing
two
minutes
*NL*
under
the
lights
of
the
lobby
while
the
night
clerk
and
a
few
belated
*NL*
guests
stared
at
them
curiously
;
the
loudly
dressed
girl
with
bent
head
,
*NL*
the
handsome
young
man
with
his
chin
several
points
aloft
;
the
inference
*NL*
was
quite
obvious
.
Then
the
chill
outdoors
--
where
the
salt
air
was
*NL*
fresher
and
keener
still
with
the
first
hints
of
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
get
one
of
those
taxis
and
beat
it
,
''
said
Olson
,
pointing
to
*NL*
the
blurred
outline
of
two
machines
whose
drivers
were
presumably
asleep
*NL*
inside
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-by
,
''
said
Olson
.
He
reached
in
his
pocket
suggestively
,
but
Amory
*NL*
snorted
,
and
,
taking
the
girl
's
arm
,
turned
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
did
you
tell
the
driver
to
go
?
''
she
asked
as
they
whirled
along
*NL*
the
dim
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
station
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
that
guy
writes
my
mother

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
wo
n't
.
Nobody
'll
ever
know
about
this
--
except
our
friends
and
*NL*
enemies

''
*NL*
*NL*
Dawn
was
breaking
over
the
sea
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
getting
blue
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
does
very
well
,
''
agreed
Amory
critically
,
and
then
as
an
*NL*
after-thought
:
``
It
's
almost
breakfast-time
--
do
you
want
something
to
*NL*
eat
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Food
--
''
she
said
with
a
cheerful
laugh
.
``
Food
is
what
queered
the
*NL*
party
.
We
ordered
a
big
supper
to
be
sent
up
to
the
room
about
two
*NL*
o'clock
.
Alec
did
n't
give
the
waiter
a
tip
,
so
I
guess
the
little
*NL*
bastard
snitched
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jill
's
low
spirits
seemed
to
have
gone
faster
than
the
scattering
night
.
*NL*
``
Let
me
tell
you
,
''
she
said
emphatically
,
``
when
you
want
to
stage
that
*NL*
sorta
party
stay
away
from
liquor
,
and
when
you
want
to
get
tight
stay
*NL*
away
from
bedrooms
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
remember
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
tapped
suddenly
at
the
glass
and
they
drew
up
at
the
door
of
an
*NL*
all-night
restaurant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
Alec
a
great
friend
of
yours
?
''
asked
Jill
as
they
perched
themselves
*NL*
on
high
stools
inside
,
and
set
their
elbows
on
the
dingy
counter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
used
to
be
.
He
probably
wo
n't
want
to
be
any
more

and
never
*NL*
understand
why
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
sorta
crazy
you
takin

all
that
blame
.
Is
he
pretty
important
?
*NL*
Kinda
more
important
than
you
are
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
remains
to
be
seen
,

he
answered
.
``
That
's
the
question

THE
COLLAPSE
OF
SEVERAL
PILLARS
*NL*
*NL*
Two
days
later
back
in
New
York
Amory
found
in
a
newspaper
what
he
*NL*
had
been
searching
for
--
a
dozen
lines
which
announced
to
whom
it
might
*NL*
concern
that
Mr.
Amory
Blaine
,
who
``
gave
his
address
''
as
,
etc.
,
had
been
*NL*
requested
to
leave
his
hotel
in
Atlantic
City
because
of
entertaining
in
*NL*
his
room
a
lady
_
not
_
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
started
,
and
his
fingers
trembled
,
for
directly
above
was
a
*NL*
longer
paragraph
of
which
the
first
words
were
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Leland
R.
Connage
are
announcing
the
engagement
of
their
*NL*
daughter
,
Rosalind
,
to
Mr.
J.
Dawson
Ryder
,
of
Hartford
,
Connecticut
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
dropped
the
paper
and
lay
down
on
his
bed
with
a
frightened
,
sinking
*NL*
sensation
in
the
pit
of
his
stomach
.
She
was
gone
,
definitely
,
finally
*NL*
gone
.
Until
now
he
had
half
unconsciously
cherished
the
hope
deep
in
his
*NL*
heart
that
some
day
she
would
need
him
and
send
for
him
,
cry
that
it
had
*NL*
been
a
mistake
,
that
her
heart
ached
only
for
the
pain
she
had
caused
*NL*
him
.
Never
again
could
he
find
even
the
sombre
luxury
of
wanting
*NL*
her
--
not
this
Rosalind
,
harder
,
older
--
nor
any
beaten
,
broken
woman
that
*NL*
his
imagination
brought
to
the
door
of
his
forties
--
Amory
had
wanted
her
*NL*
youth
,
the
fresh
radiance
of
her
mind
and
body
,
the
stuff
that
she
was
*NL*
selling
now
once
and
for
all
.
So
far
as
he
was
concerned
,
young
Rosalind
*NL*
was
dead
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
day
later
came
a
crisp
,
terse
letter
from
Mr.
Barton
in
Chicago
,
which
*NL*
informed
him
that
as
three
more
street-car
companies
had
gone
into
*NL*
the
hands
of
receivers
he
could
expect
for
the
present
no
further
*NL*
remittances
.
Last
of
all
,
on
a
dazed
Sunday
night
,
a
telegram
told
him
*NL*
of
Monsignor
Darcy
's
sudden
death
in
Philadelphia
five
days
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
knew
then
what
it
was
that
he
had
perceived
among
the
curtains
of
the
*NL*
room
in
Atlantic
City

The

in

With

restrained

To

As

flies

And
so
in

Oh

Might
I
*NL*
Throw
off
the
heat
of
that
old
wine

See
the
new
morning
mass
the
sky

With
fairy
towers

line
on

Find

A
symbol

not

But
old
monotony

Endless
avenues
of
rain

''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Under
the
glass
portcullis
of
a
theatre
Amory
stood
,
watching
the
first
*NL*
great
drops
of
rain
splatter
down
and
flatten
to
dark
stains
on
the
*NL*
sidewalk
.
The
air
became
gray
and
opalescent
;
a
solitary
light
suddenly
*NL*
outlined
a
window
over
the
way
;
then
another
light
;
then
a
hundred
more
*NL*
danced
and
glimmered
into
vision
.
Under
his
feet
a
thick
,
iron-studded
*NL*
skylight
turned
yellow
;
in
the
street
the
lamps
of
the
taxi-cabs
sent
*NL*
out
glistening
sheens
along
the
already
black
pavement
.
The
unwelcome
*NL*
November
rain
had
perversely
stolen
the
day
's
last
hour
and
pawned
it
*NL*
with
that
ancient
fence
,
the
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
silence
of
the
theatre
behind
him
ended
with
a
curious
snapping
*NL*
sound
,
followed
by
the
heavy
roaring
of
a
rising
crowd
and
the
*NL*
interlaced
clatter
of
many
voices
.
The
matinee
was
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
stood
aside
,
edged
a
little
into
the
rain
to
let
the
throng
pass
.
A
*NL*
small
boy
rushed
out
,
sniffed
in
the
damp
,
fresh
air
and
turned
up
the
*NL*
collar
of
his
coat
;
came
three
or
four
couples
in
a
great
hurry
;
came
*NL*
a
further
scattering
of
people
whose
eyes
as
they
emerged
glanced
*NL*
invariably
,
first
at
the
wet
street
,
then
at
the
rain-filled
air
,
*NL*
finally
at
the
dismal
sky
;
last
a
dense
,
strolling
mass
that
depressed
*NL*
him
with
its
heavy
odor
compounded
of
the
tobacco
smell
of
the
men
and
*NL*
the
fetid
sensuousness
of
stale
powder
on
women
.
After
the
thick
crowd
*NL*
came
another
scattering
;
a
stray
half-dozen
;
a
man
on
crutches
;
finally
*NL*
the
rattling
bang
of
folding
seats
inside
announced
that
the
ushers
were
*NL*
at
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
New
York
seemed
not
so
much
awakening
as
turning
over
in
its
bed
.
Pallid
*NL*
men
rushed
by
,
pinching
together
their
coat-collars
;
a
great
swarm
of
*NL*
tired
,
magpie
girls
from
a
department-store
crowded
along
with
shrieks
*NL*
of
strident
laughter
,
three
to
an
umbrella
;
a
squad
of
marching
*NL*
policemen
passed
,
already
miraculously
protected
by
oilskin
capes
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
rain
gave
Amory
a
feeling
of
detachment
,
and
the
numerous
unpleasant
*NL*
aspects
of
city
life
without
money
occurred
to
him
in
threatening
*NL*
procession
.
There
was
the
ghastly
,
stinking
crush
of
the
subway
--
the
car
*NL*
cards
thrusting
themselves
at
one
,
leering
out
like
dull
bores
who
grab
*NL*
your
arm
with
another
story
;
the
querulous
worry
as
to
whether
some
one
*NL*
is
n't
leaning
on
you
;
a
man
deciding
not
to
give
his
seat
to
a
woman
,
*NL*
hating
her
for
it
;
the
woman
hating
him
for
not
doing
it
;
at
worst
a
*NL*
squalid
phantasmagoria
of
breath
,
and
old
cloth
on
human
bodies
and
the
*NL*
smells
of
the
food
men
ate
--
at
best
just
people
--
too
hot
or
too
cold
,
*NL*
tired
,
worried
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
pictured
the
rooms
where
these
people
lived
--
where
the
patterns
of
*NL*
the
blistered
wall-papers
were
heavy
reiterated
sunflowers
on
green
and
*NL*
yellow
backgrounds
,
where
there
were
tin
bathtubs
and
gloomy
hallways
*NL*
and
verdureless
,
unnamable
spaces
in
back
of
the
buildings
;
where
even
*NL*
love
dressed
as
seduction
--
a
sordid
murder
around
the
corner
,
illicit
*NL*
motherhood
in
the
flat
above
.
And
always
there
was
the
economical
*NL*
stuffiness
of
indoor
winter
,
and
the
long
summers
,
nightmares
of
*NL*
perspiration
between
sticky
enveloping
walls
...
dirty
restaurants
where
*NL*
careless
,
tired
people
helped
themselves
to
sugar
with
their
own
used
*NL*
coffee-spoons
,
leaving
hard
brown
deposits
in
the
bowl
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
so
bad
where
there
were
only
men
or
else
only
women
;
it
was
*NL*
when
they
were
vilely
herded
that
it
all
seemed
so
rotten
.
It
was
some
*NL*
shame
that
women
gave
off
at
having
men
see
them
tired
and
poor
--
it
*NL*
was
some
disgust
that
men
had
for
women
who
were
tired
and
poor
.
It
was
*NL*
dirtier
than
any
battle-field
he
had
seen
,
harder
to
contemplate
than
*NL*
any
actual
hardship
moulded
of
mire
and
sweat
and
danger
,
it
was
an
*NL*
atmosphere
wherein
birth
and
marriage
and
death
were
loathsome
,
secret
*NL*
things
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
remembered
one
day
in
the
subway
when
a
delivery
boy
had
brought
in
a
*NL*
great
funeral
wreath
of
fresh
flowers
,
how
the
smell
of
it
had
suddenly
*NL*
cleared
the
air
and
given
every
one
in
the
car
a
momentary
glow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
detest
poor
people
,
''
thought
Amory
suddenly
.
``
I
hate
them
for
being
*NL*
poor
.
Poverty
may
have
been
beautiful
once
,
but
it
's
rotten
now
.
It
's
*NL*
the
ugliest
thing
in
the
world
.
It
's
essentially
cleaner
to
be
corrupt
*NL*
and
rich
than
it
is
to
be
innocent
and
poor
.
''
He
seemed
to
see
again
a
*NL*
figure
whose
significance
had
once
impressed
him
--
a
well-dressed
young
*NL*
man
gazing
from
a
club
window
on
Fifth
Avenue
and
saying
something
to
*NL*
his
companion
with
a
look
of
utter
disgust
.
Probably
,
thought
Amory
,
*NL*
what
he
said
was
:
``
My
God
!
Are
n't
people
horrible
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Never
before
in
his
life
had
Amory
considered
poor
people
.
He
thought
*NL*
cynically
how
completely
he
was
lacking
in
all
human
sympathy
.
O.
Henry
*NL*
had
found
in
these
people
romance
,
pathos
,
love
,
hate
--
Amory
saw
only
*NL*
coarseness
,
physical
filth
,
and
stupidity
.
He
made
no
self-accusations
:
*NL*
never
any
more
did
he
reproach
himself
for
feelings
that
were
*NL*
natural
and
sincere
.
He
accepted
all
his
reactions
as
a
part
of
him
,
*NL*
unchangeable
,
unmoral
.
This
problem
of
poverty
transformed
,
magnified
,
*NL*
attached
to
some
grander
,
more
dignified
attitude
might
some
day
even
be
*NL*
his
problem
;
at
present
it
roused
only
his
profound
distaste
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
walked
over
to
Fifth
Avenue
,
dodging
the
blind
,
black
menace
of
*NL*
umbrellas
,
and
standing
in
front
of
Delmonico
's
hailed
an
auto-bus
.
*NL*
Buttoning
his
coat
closely
around
him
he
climbed
to
the
roof
,
where
he
*NL*
rode
in
solitary
state
through
the
thin
,
persistent
rain
,
stung
*NL*
into
alertness
by
the
cool
moisture
perpetually
reborn
on
his
cheek
.
*NL*
Somewhere
in
his
mind
a
conversation
began
,
rather
resumed
its
place
*NL*
in
his
attention
.
It
was
composed
not
of
two
voices
,
but
of
one
,
which
*NL*
acted
alike
as
questioner
and
answerer
:
*NL*
*NL*
Question
.
--
Well
--
what
's
the
situation
?
*NL*
*NL*
Answer
.
--
That
I
have
about
twenty-four
dollars
to
my
name
.
*NL*
*NL*
Q.
--
You
have
the
Lake
Geneva
estate
.
*NL*
*NL*
A.
--
But
I
intend
to
keep
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Q.
--
Can
you
live
?
*NL*
*NL*
A.
--
I
ca
n't
imagine
not
being
able
to
.
People
make
money
in
books
and
*NL*
I
've
found
that
I
can
always
do
the
things
that
people
do
in
books
.
*NL*
Really
they
are
the
only
things
I
can
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
Q.
--
Be
definite
.
*NL*
*NL*
A.
--
I
do
n't
know
what
I
'll
do
--
nor
have
I
much
curiosity
.
To-morrow
I
'm
*NL*
going
to
leave
New
York
for
good
.
It
's
a
bad
town
unless
you
're
on
top
*NL*
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Q.
--
Do
you
want
a
lot
of
money
?
*NL*
*NL*
A.
--
No
.
I
am
merely
afraid
of
being
poor
.
*NL*
*NL*
Q.
--
Very
afraid
?
*NL*
*NL*
A.
--
Just
passively
afraid
.
*NL*
*NL*
Q.
--
Where
are
you
drifting
?
*NL*
*NL*
A.
--
Do
n't
ask
_
me
!
_
*NL*
*NL*
Q.
--
Do
n't
you
care
?
*NL*
*NL*
A.
--
Rather
.
I
do
n't
want
to
commit
moral
suicide
.
*NL*
*NL*
Q.
--
Have
you
no
interests
left
?
*NL*
*NL*
A.
--
None
.
I
've
no
more
virtue
to
lose
.
Just
as
a
cooling
pot
gives
*NL*
off
heat
,
so
all
through
youth
and
adolescence
we
give
off
calories
of
*NL*
virtue
.
That
's
what
's
called
ingenuousness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Q.
--
An
interesting
idea
.
*NL*
*NL*
A.
--
That
's
why
a
``
good
man
going
wrong
''
attracts
people
.
They
stand
*NL*
around
and
literally
_
warm
themselves
_
at
the
calories
of
virtue
he
*NL*
gives
off
.
Sarah
makes
an
unsophisticated
remark
and
the
faces
simper
in
*NL*
delight
--
``
How
_
innocent
_
the
poor
child
is
!
''
They
're
warming
themselves
*NL*
at
her
virtue
.
But
Sarah
sees
the
simper
and
never
makes
that
remark
*NL*
again
.
Only
she
feels
a
little
colder
after
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
Q.
--
All
your
calories
gone
?
*NL*
*NL*
A.
--
All
of
them
.
I
'm
beginning
to
warm
myself
at
other
people
's
virtue
.
*NL*
*NL*
Q.
--
Are
you
corrupt
?
*NL*
*NL*
A.
--
I
think
so
.
I
'm
not
sure
.
I
'm
not
sure
about
good
and
evil
at
all
*NL*
any
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
Q.
--
Is
that
a
bad
sign
in
itself
?
*NL*
*NL*
A.
--
Not
necessarily
.
*NL*
*NL*
Q.
--
What
would
be
the
test
of
corruption
?
*NL*
*NL*
A.
--
Becoming
really
insincere
--
calling
myself
``
not
such
a
bad
fellow
,
''
*NL*
thinking
I
regretted
my
lost
youth
when
I
only
envy
the
delights
of
*NL*
losing
it
.
Youth
is
like
having
a
big
plate
of
candy
.
Sentimentalists
*NL*
think
they
want
to
be
in
the
pure
,
simple
state
they
were
in
before
they
*NL*
ate
the
candy
.
They
do
n't
.
They
just
want
the
fun
of
eating
it
all
over
*NL*
again
.
The
matron
does
n't
want
to
repeat
her
girlhood
--
she
wants
to
*NL*
repeat
her
honeymoon
.
I
do
n't
want
to
repeat
my
innocence
.
I
want
the
*NL*
pleasure
of
losing
it
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Q.
--
Where
are
you
drifting
?
*NL*
*NL*
This
dialogue
merged
grotesquely
into
his
mind
's
most
familiar
state
--
a
*NL*
grotesque
blending
of
desires
,
worries
,
exterior
impressions
and
*NL*
physical
reactions
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
Hundred
and
Twenty-seventh
Street
--
or
One
Hundred
and
Thirty-seventh
*NL*
Street
...
Two
and
three
look
alike
--
no
,
not
much
.
Seat
damp
...
are
*NL*
clothes
absorbing
wetness
from
seat
,
or
seat
absorbing
dryness
from
*NL*
clothes
?
...
Sitting
on
wet
substance
gave
appendicitis
,
so
Froggy
*NL*
Parker
's
mother
said
.
Well
,
he
'd
had
it
--
I
'll
sue
the
steamboat
company
,
*NL*
Beatrice
said
,
and
my
uncle
has
a
quarter
interest
--
did
Beatrice
go
to
*NL*
heaven
?
...
probably
not
--
He
represented
Beatrice
's
immortality
,
also
*NL*
love-affairs
of
numerous
dead
men
who
surely
had
never
thought
of
*NL*
him
...
if
it
was
n't
appendicitis
,
influenza
maybe
.
What
?
One
Hundred
*NL*
and
Twentieth
Street
?
That
must
have
been
One
Hundred
and
Twelfth
back
*NL*
there
.
One
O
Two
instead
of
One
Two
Seven
.
Rosalind
not
like
Beatrice
,
*NL*
Eleanor
like
Beatrice
,
only
wilder
and
brainier
.
Apartments
along
here
*NL*
expensive
--
probably
hundred
and
fifty
a
month
--
maybe
two
hundred
.
Uncle
*NL*
had
only
paid
hundred
a
month
for
whole
great
big
house
in
Minneapolis
.
*NL*
Question
--
were
the
stairs
on
the
left
or
right
as
you
came
in
?
Anyway
,
*NL*
in
12
Univee
they
were
straight
back
and
to
the
left
.
What
a
dirty
*NL*
river
--
want
to
go
down
there
and
see
if
it
's
dirty
--
French
rivers
all
*NL*
brown
or
black
,
so
were
Southern
rivers
.
Twenty-four
dollars
meant
four
*NL*
hundred
and
eighty
doughnuts
.
He
could
live
on
it
three
months
and
sleep
*NL*
in
the
park
.
Wonder
where
Jill
was
--
Jill
Bayne
,
Fayne
,
Sayne
--
what
the
*NL*
devil
--
neck
hurts
,
darned
uncomfortable
seat
.
No
desire
to
sleep
with
*NL*
Jill
,
what
could
Alec
see
in
her
?
Alec
had
a
coarse
taste
in
women
.
Own
*NL*
taste
the
best
;
Isabelle
,
Clara
,
Rosalind
,
Eleanor
,
were
all-American
.
*NL*
Eleanor
would
pitch
,
probably
southpaw
.
Rosalind
was
outfield
,
wonderful
*NL*
hitter
,
Clara
first
base
,
maybe
.
Wonder
what
Humbird
's
body
looked
like
*NL*
now
.
If
he
himself
had
n't
been
bayonet
instructor
he
'd
have
gone
up
*NL*
to
line
three
months
sooner
,
probably
been
killed
.
Where
's
the
darned
*NL*
bell
--
*NL*
*NL*
The
street
numbers
of
Riverside
Drive
were
obscured
by
the
mist
and
*NL*
dripping
trees
from
anything
but
the
swiftest
scrutiny
,
but
Amory
had
*NL*
finally
caught
sight
of
one
--
One
Hundred
and
Twenty-seventh
Street
.
He
*NL*
got
off
and
with
no
distinct
destination
followed
a
winding
,
descending
*NL*
sidewalk
and
came
out
facing
the
river
,
in
particular
a
long
pier
and
*NL*
a
partitioned
litter
of
shipyards
for
miniature
craft
:
small
launches
,
*NL*
canoes
,
rowboats
,
and
catboats
.
He
turned
northward
and
followed
the
*NL*
shore
,
jumped
a
small
wire
fence
and
found
himself
in
a
great
disorderly
*NL*
yard
adjoining
a
dock
.
The
hulls
of
many
boats
in
various
stages
of
*NL*
repair
were
around
him
;
he
smelled
sawdust
and
paint
and
the
scarcely
*NL*
distinguishable
fiat
odor
of
the
Hudson
.
A
man
approached
through
the
*NL*
heavy
gloom
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hello
,
''
said
Amory
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Got
a
pass
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
Is
this
private
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
the
Hudson
River
Sporting
and
Yacht
Club
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
I
did
n't
know
.
I
'm
just
resting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
''
began
the
man
dubiously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
go
if
you
want
me
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
made
non-committal
noises
in
his
throat
and
passed
on
.
Amory
*NL*
seated
himself
on
an
overturned
boat
and
leaned
forward
thoughtfully
*NL*
until
his
chin
rested
in
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Misfortune
is
liable
to
make
me
a
damn
bad
man
,
''
he
said
slowly
.
*NL*
*NL*
*****
*NL*
*NL*
IN
THE
DROOPING
HOURS
*NL*
*NL*
While
the
rain
drizzled
on
Amory
looked
futilely
back
at
the
stream
of
*NL*
his
life
,
all
its
glitterings
and
dirty
shallows
.
To
begin
with
,
he
was
*NL*
still
afraid
--
not
physically
afraid
any
more
,
but
afraid
of
people
and
*NL*
prejudice
and
misery
and
monotony
.
Yet
,
deep
in
his
bitter
heart
,
he
*NL*
wondered
if
he
was
after
all
worse
than
this
man
or
the
next
.
He
knew
*NL*
that
he
could
sophisticate
himself
finally
into
saying
that
his
own
*NL*
weakness
was
just
the
result
of
circumstances
and
environment
;
that
*NL*
often
when
he
raged
at
himself
as
an
egotist
something
would
whisper
*NL*
ingratiatingly
:
``
No
.
Genius
!
''
That
was
one
manifestation
of
fear
,
that
*NL*
voice
which
whispered
that
he
could
not
be
both
great
and
good
,
that
*NL*
genius
was
the
exact
combination
of
those
inexplicable
grooves
and
*NL*
twists
in
his
mind
,
that
any
discipline
would
curb
it
to
mediocrity
.
*NL*
Probably
more
than
any
concrete
vice
or
failing
Amory
despised
his
own
*NL*
personality
--
he
loathed
knowing
that
to-morrow
and
the
thousand
days
*NL*
after
he
would
swell
pompously
at
a
compliment
and
sulk
at
an
ill
word
*NL*
like
a
third-rate
musician
or
a
first-class
actor
.
He
was
ashamed
of
the
*NL*
fact
that
very
simple
and
honest
people
usually
distrusted
him
;
that
*NL*
he
had
been
cruel
,
often
,
to
those
who
had
sunk
their
personalities
in
*NL*
him
--
several
girls
,
and
a
man
here
and
there
through
college
,
that
he
*NL*
had
been
an
evil
influence
on
;
people
who
had
followed
him
here
and
*NL*
there
into
mental
adventures
from
which
he
alone
rebounded
unscathed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Usually
,
on
nights
like
this
,
for
there
had
been
many
lately
,
he
could
*NL*
escape
from
this
consuming
introspection
by
thinking
of
children
and
the
*NL*
infinite
possibilities
of
children
--
he
leaned
and
listened
and
he
heard
*NL*
a
startled
baby
awake
in
a
house
across
the
street
and
lend
a
tiny
*NL*
whimper
to
the
still
night
.
Quick
as
a
flash
he
turned
away
,
wondering
*NL*
with
a
touch
of
panic
whether
something
in
the
brooding
despair
of
his
*NL*
mood
had
made
a
darkness
in
its
tiny
soul
.
He
shivered
.
What
if
some
*NL*
day
the
balance
was
overturned
,
and
he
became
a
thing
that
frightened
*NL*
children
and
crept
into
rooms
in
the
dark
,
approached
dim
communion
with
*NL*
those
phantoms
who
whispered
shadowy
secrets
to
the
mad
of
that
dark
*NL*
continent
upon
the
moon
...
*NL*
*NL*
*****
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
smiled
a
bit
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
too
much
wrapped
up
in
yourself
,
''
he
heard
some
one
say
.
And
*NL*
again
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Get
out
and
do
some
real
work
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stop
worrying
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
fancied
a
possible
future
comment
of
his
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
I
was
perhaps
an
egotist
in
youth
,
but
I
soon
found
it
made
me
*NL*
morbid
to
think
too
much
about
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*****
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
he
felt
an
overwhelming
desire
to
let
himself
go
to
the
*NL*
devil
--
not
to
go
violently
as
a
gentleman
should
,
but
to
sink
safely
*NL*
and
sensuously
out
of
sight
.
He
pictured
himself
in
an
adobe
house
in
*NL*
Mexico
,
half-reclining
on
a
rug-covered
couch
,
his
slender
,
artistic
*NL*
fingers
closed
on
a
cigarette
while
he
listened
to
guitars
strumming
*NL*
melancholy
undertones
to
an
age-old
dirge
of
Castile
and
an
*NL*
olive-skinned
,
carmine-lipped
girl
caressed
his
hair
.
Here
he
might
live
*NL*
a
strange
litany
,
delivered
from
right
and
wrong
and
from
the
hound
of
*NL*
heaven
and
from
every
God
-LRB-
except
the
exotic
Mexican
one
who
was
pretty
*NL*
slack
himself
and
rather
addicted
to
Oriental
scents
-RRB-
--
delivered
from
*NL*
success
and
hope
and
poverty
into
that
long
chute
of
indulgence
which
*NL*
led
,
after
all
,
only
to
the
artificial
lake
of
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
so
many
places
where
one
might
deteriorate
pleasantly
:
Port
*NL*
Said
,
Shanghai
,
parts
of
Turkestan
,
Constantinople
,
the
South
Seas
--
all
*NL*
lands
of
sad
,
haunting
music
and
many
odors
,
where
lust
could
be
a
mode
*NL*
and
expression
of
life
,
where
the
shades
of
night
skies
and
sunsets
*NL*
would
seem
to
reflect
only
moods
of
passion
:
the
colors
of
lips
and
*NL*
poppies
.
*NL*
*NL*
*****
*NL*
*NL*
STILL
WEEDING
*NL*
*NL*
Once
he
had
been
miraculously
able
to
scent
evil
as
a
horse
detects
a
*NL*
broken
bridge
at
night
,
but
the
man
with
the
queer
feet
in
Phoebe
's
*NL*
room
had
diminished
to
the
aura
over
Jill
.
His
instinct
perceived
the
*NL*
fetidness
of
poverty
,
but
no
longer
ferreted
out
the
deeper
evils
in
*NL*
pride
and
sensuality
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
no
more
wise
men
;
there
were
no
more
heroes
;
Burne
Holiday
*NL*
was
sunk
from
sight
as
though
he
had
never
lived
;
Monsignor
was
dead
.
*NL*
Amory
had
grown
up
to
a
thousand
books
,
a
thousand
lies
;
he
had
listened
*NL*
eagerly
to
people
who
pretended
to
know
,
who
knew
nothing
.
The
mystical
*NL*
reveries
of
saints
that
had
once
filled
him
with
awe
in
the
still
hours
*NL*
of
night
,
now
vaguely
repelled
him
.
The
Byrons
and
Brookes
who
had
*NL*
defied
life
from
mountain
tops
were
in
the
end
but
flaneurs
and
poseurs
,
*NL*
at
best
mistaking
the
shadow
of
courage
for
the
substance
of
wisdom
.
*NL*
The
pageantry
of
his
disillusion
took
shape
in
a
world-old
procession
*NL*
of
Prophets
,
Athenians
,
Martyrs
,
Saints
,
Scientists
,
Don
Juans
,
Jesuits
,
*NL*
Puritans
,
Fausts
,
Poets
,
Pacifists
;
like
costumed
alumni
at
a
college
*NL*
reunion
they
streamed
before
him
as
their
dreams
,
personalities
,
and
*NL*
creeds
had
in
turn
thrown
colored
lights
on
his
soul
;
each
had
tried
to
*NL*
express
the
glory
of
life
and
the
tremendous
significance
of
man
;
each
*NL*
had
boasted
of
synchronizing
what
had
gone
before
into
his
own
rickety
*NL*
generalities
;
each
had
depended
after
all
on
the
set
stage
and
the
*NL*
convention
of
the
theatre
,
which
is
that
man
in
his
hunger
for
faith
*NL*
will
feed
his
mind
with
the
nearest
and
most
convenient
food
.
*NL*
*NL*
Women
--
of
whom
he
had
expected
so
much
;
whose
beauty
he
had
hoped
to
*NL*
transmute
into
modes
of
art
;
whose
unfathomable
instincts
,
marvellously
*NL*
incoherent
and
inarticulate
,
he
had
thought
to
perpetuate
in
terms
of
*NL*
experience
--
had
become
merely
consecrations
to
their
own
posterity
.
*NL*
Isabelle
,
Clara
,
Rosalind
,
Eleanor
,
were
all
removed
by
their
*NL*
very
beauty
,
around
which
men
had
swarmed
,
from
the
possibility
of
*NL*
contributing
anything
but
a
sick
heart
and
a
page
of
puzzled
words
to
*NL*
write
.
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
based
his
loss
of
faith
in
help
from
others
on
several
sweeping
*NL*
syllogisms
.
Granted
that
his
generation
,
however
bruised
and
decimated
*NL*
from
this
Victorian
war
,
were
the
heirs
of
progress
.
Waving
aside
petty
*NL*
differences
of
conclusions
which
,
although
they
might
occasionally
*NL*
cause
the
deaths
of
several
millions
of
young
men
,
might
be
explained
*NL*
away
--
supposing
that
after
all
Bernard
Shaw
and
Bernhardi
,
Bonar
Law
*NL*
and
Bethmann-Hollweg
were
mutual
heirs
of
progress
if
only
in
agreeing
*NL*
against
the
ducking
of
witches
--
waiving
the
antitheses
and
approaching
*NL*
individually
these
men
who
seemed
to
be
the
leaders
,
he
was
repelled
by
*NL*
the
discrepancies
and
contradictions
in
the
men
themselves
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
,
for
example
,
Thornton
Hancock
,
respected
by
half
the
*NL*
intellectual
world
as
an
authority
on
life
,
a
man
who
had
verified
and
*NL*
believed
the
code
he
lived
by
,
an
educator
of
educators
,
an
adviser
to
*NL*
Presidents
--
yet
Amory
knew
that
this
man
had
,
in
his
heart
,
leaned
on
*NL*
the
priest
of
another
religion
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
Monsignor
,
upon
whom
a
cardinal
rested
,
had
moments
of
strange
and
*NL*
horrible
insecurity
--
inexplicable
in
a
religion
that
explained
even
*NL*
disbelief
in
terms
of
its
own
faith
:
if
you
doubted
the
devil
it
was
the
*NL*
devil
that
made
you
doubt
him
.
Amory
had
seen
Monsignor
go
to
the
houses
*NL*
of
stolid
philistines
,
read
popular
novels
furiously
,
saturate
himself
*NL*
in
routine
,
to
escape
from
that
horror
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
this
priest
,
a
little
wiser
,
somewhat
purer
,
had
been
,
Amory
knew
,
*NL*
not
essentially
older
than
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
was
alone
--
he
had
escaped
from
a
small
enclosure
into
a
great
*NL*
labyrinth
.
He
was
where
Goethe
was
when
he
began
``
Faust
''
;
he
was
where
*NL*
Conrad
was
when
he
wrote
``
Almayer
's
Folly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
said
to
himself
that
there
were
essentially
two
sorts
of
people
*NL*
who
through
natural
clarity
or
disillusion
left
the
enclosure
and
*NL*
sought
the
labyrinth
.
There
were
men
like
Wells
and
Plato
,
who
had
,
*NL*
half
unconsciously
,
a
strange
,
hidden
orthodoxy
,
who
would
accept
*NL*
for
themselves
only
what
could
be
accepted
for
all
men
--
incurable
*NL*
romanticists
who
never
,
for
all
their
efforts
,
could
enter
the
labyrinth
*NL*
as
stark
souls
;
there
were
on
the
other
hand
sword-like
pioneering
*NL*
personalities
,
Samuel
Butler
,
Renan
,
Voltaire
,
who
progressed
much
*NL*
slower
,
yet
eventually
much
further
,
not
in
the
direct
pessimistic
line
*NL*
of
speculative
philosophy
but
concerned
in
the
eternal
attempt
to
attach
*NL*
a
positive
value
to
life
...
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
stopped
.
He
began
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
to
have
a
strong
*NL*
distrust
of
all
generalities
and
epigrams
.
They
were
too
easy
,
too
*NL*
dangerous
to
the
public
mind
.
Yet
all
thought
usually
reached
the
*NL*
public
after
thirty
years
in
some
such
form
:
Benson
and
Chesterton
had
*NL*
popularized
Huysmans
and
Newman
;
Shaw
had
sugar-coated
Nietzsche
and
*NL*
Ibsen
and
Schopenhauer
.
The
man
in
the
street
heard
the
conclusions
*NL*
of
dead
genius
through
some
one
else
's
clever
paradoxes
and
didactic
*NL*
epigrams
.
*NL*
*NL*
Life
was
a
damned
muddle
...
a
football
game
with
every
one
off-side
and
*NL*
the
referee
gotten
rid
of
--
every
one
claiming
the
referee
would
have
*NL*
been
on
his
side
...
*NL*
*NL*
Progress
was
a
labyrinth
...
people
plunging
blindly
in
and
then
rushing
*NL*
wildly
back
,
shouting
that
they
had
found
it
...
the
invisible
king
--
the
*NL*
elan
vital
--
the
principle
of
evolution
...
writing
a
book
,
starting
a
*NL*
war
,
founding
a
school
...
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
,
even
had
he
not
been
a
selfish
man
,
would
have
started
all
*NL*
inquiries
with
himself
.
He
was
his
own
best
example
--
sitting
in
the
*NL*
rain
,
a
human
creature
of
sex
and
pride
,
foiled
by
chance
and
his
own
*NL*
temperament
of
the
balm
of
love
and
children
,
preserved
to
help
in
*NL*
building
up
the
living
consciousness
of
the
race
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
self-reproach
and
loneliness
and
disillusion
he
came
to
the
entrance
*NL*
of
the
labyrinth
.
*NL*
*NL*
*****
*NL*
*NL*
Another
dawn
flung
itself
across
the
river
,
a
belated
taxi
hurried
along
*NL*
the
street
,
its
lamps
still
shining
like
burning
eyes
in
a
face
white
*NL*
from
a
night
's
carouse
.
A
melancholy
siren
sounded
far
down
the
river
.
*NL*
*NL*
*****
*NL*
*NL*
MONSIGNOR
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
kept
thinking
how
Monsignor
would
have
enjoyed
his
own
funeral
.
*NL*
It
was
magnificently
Catholic
and
liturgical
.
Bishop
O'Neill
sang
solemn
*NL*
high
mass
and
the
cardinal
gave
the
final
absolutions
.
Thornton
Hancock
,
*NL*
Mrs.
Lawrence
,
the
British
and
Italian
ambassadors
,
the
papal
delegate
,
*NL*
and
a
host
of
friends
and
priests
were
there
--
yet
the
inexorable
shears
*NL*
had
cut
through
all
these
threads
that
Monsignor
had
gathered
into
his
*NL*
hands
.
To
Amory
it
was
a
haunting
grief
to
see
him
lying
in
his
coffin
,
*NL*
with
closed
hands
upon
his
purple
vestments
.
His
face
had
not
changed
,
*NL*
and
,
as
he
never
knew
he
was
dying
,
it
showed
no
pain
or
fear
.
It
was
*NL*
Amory
's
dear
old
friend
,
his
and
the
others
'
--
for
the
church
was
full
*NL*
of
people
with
daft
,
staring
faces
,
the
most
exalted
seeming
the
most
*NL*
stricken
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cardinal
,
like
an
archangel
in
cope
and
mitre
,
sprinkled
the
holy
*NL*
water
;
the
organ
broke
into
sound
;
the
choir
began
to
sing
the
Requiem
*NL*
Eternam
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
these
people
grieved
because
they
had
to
some
extent
depended
upon
*NL*
Monsignor
.
Their
grief
was
more
than
sentiment
for
the
``
crack
in
his
*NL*
voice
or
a
certain
break
in
his
walk
,
''
as
Wells
put
it
.
These
people
*NL*
had
leaned
on
Monsignor
's
faith
,
his
way
of
finding
cheer
,
of
making
*NL*
religion
a
thing
of
lights
and
shadows
,
making
all
light
and
shadow
*NL*
merely
aspects
of
God
.
People
felt
safe
when
he
was
near
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
Amory
's
attempted
sacrifice
had
been
born
merely
the
full
realization
*NL*
of
his
disillusion
,
but
of
Monsignor
's
funeral
was
born
the
romantic
*NL*
elf
who
was
to
enter
the
labyrinth
with
him
.
He
found
something
that
he
*NL*
wanted
,
had
always
wanted
and
always
would
want
--
not
to
be
admired
,
as
*NL*
he
had
feared
;
not
to
be
loved
,
as
he
had
made
himself
believe
;
but
to
*NL*
be
necessary
to
people
,
to
be
indispensable
;
he
remembered
the
sense
of
*NL*
security
he
had
found
in
Burne
.
*NL*
*NL*
Life
opened
up
in
one
of
its
amazing
bursts
of
radiance
and
Amory
*NL*
suddenly
and
permanently
rejected
an
old
epigram
that
had
been
playing
*NL*
listlessly
in
his
mind
:
``
Very
few
things
matter
and
nothing
matters
very
*NL*
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
contrary
,
Amory
felt
an
immense
desire
to
give
people
a
sense
of
*NL*
security
.

THE
BIG
MAN
WITH
GOGGLES
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
day
that
Amory
started
on
his
walk
to
Princeton
the
sky
was
a
*NL*
colorless
vault
,
cool
,
high
and
barren
of
the
threat
of
rain
.
It
was
a
*NL*
gray
day
,
that
least
fleshly
of
all
weathers
;
a
day
of
dreams
and
far
*NL*
hopes
and
clear
visions
.
It
was
a
day
easily
associated
with
those
*NL*
abstract
truths
and
purities
that
dissolve
in
the
sunshine
or
fade
out
*NL*
in
mocking
laughter
by
the
light
of
the
moon
.
The
trees
and
clouds
*NL*
were
carved
in
classical
severity
;
the
sounds
of
the
countryside
had
*NL*
harmonized
to
a
monotone
,
metallic
as
a
trumpet
,
breathless
as
the
*NL*
Grecian
urn
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
day
had
put
Amory
in
such
a
contemplative
mood
that
he
caused
much
*NL*
annoyance
to
several
motorists
who
were
forced
to
slow
up
considerably
*NL*
or
else
run
him
down
.
So
engrossed
in
his
thoughts
was
he
that
he
was
*NL*
scarcely
surprised
at
that
strange
phenomenon
--
cordiality
manifested
*NL*
within
fifty
miles
of
Manhattan
--
when
a
passing
car
slowed
down
*NL*
beside
him
and
a
voice
hailed
him
.
He
looked
up
and
saw
a
magnificent
*NL*
Locomobile
in
which
sat
two
middle-aged
men
,
one
of
them
small
and
*NL*
anxious
looking
,
apparently
an
artificial
growth
on
the
other
who
was
*NL*
large
and
begoggled
and
imposing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
want
a
lift
?
''
asked
the
apparently
artificial
growth
,
glancing
*NL*
from
the
corner
of
his
eye
at
the
imposing
man
as
if
for
some
habitual
,
*NL*
silent
corroboration
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
bet
I
do
.
Thanks
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
chauffeur
swung
open
the
door
,
and
,
climbing
in
,
Amory
settled
*NL*
himself
in
the
middle
of
the
back
seat
.
He
took
in
his
companions
*NL*
curiously
.
The
chief
characteristic
of
the
big
man
seemed
to
be
a
*NL*
great
confidence
in
himself
set
off
against
a
tremendous
boredom
with
*NL*
everything
around
him
.
That
part
of
his
face
which
protruded
under
the
*NL*
goggles
was
what
is
generally
termed
``
strong
''
;
rolls
of
not
undignified
*NL*
fat
had
collected
near
his
chin
;
somewhere
above
was
a
wide
thin
*NL*
mouth
and
the
rough
model
for
a
Roman
nose
,
and
,
below
,
his
shoulders
*NL*
collapsed
without
a
struggle
into
the
powerful
bulk
of
his
chest
and
*NL*
belly
.
He
was
excellently
and
quietly
dressed
.
Amory
noticed
that
he
*NL*
was
inclined
to
stare
straight
at
the
back
of
the
chauffeur
's
head
as
if
*NL*
speculating
steadily
but
hopelessly
some
baffling
hirsute
problem
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
smaller
man
was
remarkable
only
for
his
complete
submersion
in
the
*NL*
personality
of
the
other
.
He
was
of
that
lower
secretarial
type
who
*NL*
at
forty
have
engraved
upon
their
business
cards
:
``
Assistant
to
the
*NL*
President
,
''
and
without
a
sigh
consecrate
the
rest
of
their
lives
to
*NL*
second-hand
mannerisms
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Going
far
?
''
asked
the
smaller
man
in
a
pleasant
disinterested
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
a
stretch
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hiking
for
exercise
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
responded
Amory
succinctly
,
``
I
'm
walking
because
I
ca
n't
afford
to
*NL*
ride
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
again
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
looking
for
work
?
Because
there
's
lots
of
work
,
''
he
continued
*NL*
rather
testily
.
``
All
this
talk
of
lack
of
work
.
The
West
is
especially
*NL*
short
of
labor
.
''
He
expressed
the
West
with
a
sweeping
,
lateral
gesture
.
*NL*
Amory
nodded
politely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
a
trade
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
No
--
Amory
had
no
trade
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Clerk
,
eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
No
--
Amory
was
not
a
clerk
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whatever
your
line
is
,
''
said
the
little
man
,
seeming
to
agree
wisely
*NL*
with
something
Amory
had
said
,
``
now
is
the
time
of
opportunity
and
*NL*
business
openings
.
''
He
glanced
again
toward
the
big
man
,
as
a
lawyer
*NL*
grilling
a
witness
glances
involuntarily
at
the
jury
.
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
decided
that
he
must
say
something
and
for
the
life
of
him
could
*NL*
think
of
only
one
thing
to
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
I
want
a
great
lot
of
money
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
little
man
laughed
mirthlessly
but
conscientiously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
what
every
one
wants
nowadays
,
but
they
do
n't

it

*NL*
*NL*
``
A
very
natural

healthy

rich

the
financiers
in

plays
,
who
*NL*
want
to
`

their
way
through

Do
n't
you

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
not

''
said
the
secretary
indignantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
''
continued
Amory
disregarding
him
,
``
being
very
poor
at
present
I
*NL*
am
contemplating
socialism
as
possibly
my
forte

''
*NL*
*NL*
Both
men
glanced
at
him
curiously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
These
bomb
throwers

The
little
man
ceased
as
words
lurched
*NL*
ponderously
from
the
big
man
's
chest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
thought
you

thrower
I
'd
run
you

*NL*
*NL*
Amory
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What

asked
the
big
man
,
``

Bolsheviks

I
must
say
I
fail

*NL*
The
idealists
loaf
around

write
the
stuff
that
stirs
up
the
poor
*NL*
immigrants
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

''
said
Amory
,
``

an
idealist
is
both
safe
and
lucrative

I
*NL*

``

Amory
smiled
discreetly

I

The
little
man
laughed
his
conscientious
laugh
,
and
stopped
rather
*NL*
suddenly
as
Amory
's
burning
eyes
turned
on
him

twitched
nervously

Amory

decided

He
turned
to
the

*NL*
indicated
the

*NL*
``

``

Amory
*NL*
slowly

The
car
slowed
up
at
the
entrance
to
a
great
estate
,
ringed
around
by
a
*NL*
huge
hedge
and
a
tall
iron
fence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wo
n't
you
come
in
for
lunch
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
shook
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
Mr.
Ferrenby
,
but
I
've
got
to
get
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
big
man
held
out
his
hand
.
Amory
saw
that
the
fact
that
he
had
known
*NL*
Jesse
more
than
outweighed
any
disfavor
he
had
created
by
his
opinions
.
*NL*
What
ghosts
were
people
with
which
to
work
!
Even
the
little
man
insisted
*NL*
on
shaking
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-by
!
''
shouted
Mr.
Ferrenby
,
as
the
car
turned
the
corner
and
*NL*
started
up
the
drive
.
``
Good
luck
to
you
and
bad
luck
to
your
theories
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Same
to
you
,

cried
Amory
,
smiling
and
waving
his
hand

``
OUT
OF
THE
FIRE
,
OUT
OF
THE
LITTLE
ROOM
''
*NL*
*NL*
Eight
hours
from
Princeton
Amory
sat
down
by
the
Jersey
roadside
and
*NL*
looked
at
the
frost-bitten
country
.
Nature
as
a
rather
coarse
phenomenon
*NL*
composed
largely
of
flowers
that
,
when
closely
inspected
,
appeared
*NL*
moth-eaten
,
and
of
ants
that
endlessly
traversed
blades
of
grass
,
was
*NL*
always
disillusioning
;
nature
represented
by
skies
and
waters
and
far
*NL*
horizons
was
more
likable
.
Frost
and
the
promise
of
winter
thrilled
him
*NL*
now
,
made
him
think
of
a
wild
battle
between
St.
Regis
and
Groton
,
*NL*
ages
ago
,
seven
years
ago
--
and
of
an
autumn
day
in
France
twelve
months
*NL*
before
when
he
had
lain
in
tall
grass
,
his
platoon
flattened
down
close
*NL*
around
him
,
waiting
to
tap
the
shoulders
of
a
Lewis
gunner
.
He
saw
the
*NL*
two
pictures
together
with
somewhat
the
same
primitive
exaltation
--
two
*NL*
games
he
had
played
,
differing
in
quality
of
acerbity
,
linked
in
a
way
*NL*
that
differed
them
from
Rosalind
or
the
subject
of
labyrinths
which
*NL*
were
,
after
all
,
the
business
of
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
selfish
,
''
he
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
not
a
quality
that
will
change
when
I
`
see
human
suffering
'
or
*NL*
`
lose
my
parents
'
or
`
help
others
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
selfishness
is
not
only
part
of
me
.
It
is
the
most
living
part
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
by
somehow
transcending
rather
than
by
avoiding
that
selfishness
*NL*
that
I
can
bring
poise
and
balance
into
my
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
no
virtue
of
unselfishness
that
I
can
not
use
.
I
can
make
*NL*
sacrifices
,
be
charitable
,
give
to
a
friend
,
endure
for
a
friend
,
lay
*NL*
down
my
life
for
a
friend
--
all
because
these
things
may
be
the
best
*NL*
possible
expression
of
myself
;
yet
I
have
not
one
drop
of
the
milk
of
*NL*
human
kindness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
problem
of
evil
had
solidified
for
Amory
into
the
problem
of
sex
.
He
*NL*
was
beginning
to
identify
evil
with
the
strong
phallic
worship
in
Brooke
*NL*
and
the
early
Wells
.
Inseparably
linked
with
evil
was
beauty
--
beauty
,
*NL*
still
a
constant
rising
tumult
;
soft
in
Eleanor
's
voice
,
in
an
old
song
*NL*
at
night
,
rioting
deliriously
through
life
like
superimposed
waterfalls
,
*NL*
half
rhythm
,
half
darkness
.
Amory
knew
that
every
time
he
had
reached
*NL*
toward
it
longingly
it
had
leered
out
at
him
with
the
grotesque
face
of
*NL*
evil
.
Beauty
of
great
art
,
beauty
of
all
joy
,
most
of
all
the
beauty
of
*NL*
women
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
all
,
it
had
too
many
associations
with
license
and
indulgence
.
*NL*
Weak
things
were
often
beautiful
,
weak
things
were
never
good
.
And
in
*NL*
this
new
loneness
of
his
that
had
been
selected
for
what
greatness
he
*NL*
might
achieve
,
beauty
must
be
relative
or
,
itself
a
harmony
,
it
would
*NL*
make
only
a
discord
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
sense
this
gradual
renunciation
of
beauty
was
the
second
step
after
*NL*
his
disillusion
had
been
made
complete
.
He
felt
that
he
was
leaving
*NL*
behind
him
his
chance
of
being
a
certain
type
of
artist
.
It
seemed
so
*NL*
much
more
important
to
be
a
certain
sort
of
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
mind
turned
a
corner
suddenly
and
he
found
himself
thinking
of
the
*NL*
Catholic
Church
.
The
idea
was
strong
in
him
that
there
was
a
certain
*NL*
intrinsic
lack
in
those
to
whom
orthodox
religion
was
necessary
,
and
*NL*
religion
to
Amory
meant
the
Church
of
Rome
.
Quite
conceivably
it
was
an
*NL*
empty
ritual
but
it
was
seemingly
the
only
assimilative
,
traditionary
*NL*
bulwark
against
the
decay
of
morals
.
Until
the
great
mobs
could
be
*NL*
educated
into
a
moral
sense
some
one
must
cry
:
``
Thou
shalt
not
!
''
Yet
*NL*
any
acceptance
was
,
for
the
present
,
impossible
.
He
wanted
time
and
*NL*
the
absence
of
ulterior
pressure
.
He
wanted
to
keep
the
tree
without
*NL*
ornaments
,
realize
fully
the
direction
and
momentum
of
this
new
start
.
*NL*
*NL*
*****
*NL*
*NL*
The
afternoon
waned
from
the
purging
good
of
three
o'clock
to
the
golden
*NL*
beauty
of
four
.
Afterward
he
walked
through
the
dull
ache
of
a
setting
*NL*
sun
when
even
the
clouds
seemed
bleeding
and
at
twilight
he
came
to
a
*NL*
graveyard
.
There
was
a
dusky
,
dreamy
smell
of
flowers
and
the
ghost
of
a
*NL*
new
moon
in
the
sky
and
shadows
everywhere
.
On
an
impulse
he
considered
*NL*
trying
to
open
the
door
of
a
rusty
iron
vault
built
into
the
side
of
*NL*
a
hill
;
a
vault
washed
clean
and
covered
with
late-blooming
,
weepy
*NL*
watery-blue
flowers
that
might
have
grown
from
dead
eyes
,
sticky
to
the
*NL*
touch
with
a
sickening
odor
.
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
wanted
to
feel
``
William
Dayfield
,
1864
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
wondered
that
graves
ever
made
people
consider
life
in
vain
.
Somehow
*NL*
he
could
find
nothing
hopeless
in
having
lived
.
All
the
broken
columns
*NL*
and
clasped
hands
and
doves
and
angels
meant
romances
.
He
fancied
that
*NL*
in
a
hundred
years
he
would
like
having
young
people
speculate
as
to
*NL*
whether
his
eyes
were
brown
or
blue
,
and
he
hoped
quite
passionately
*NL*
that
his
grave
would
have
about
it
an
air
of
many
,
many
years
ago
.
It
*NL*
seemed
strange
that
out
of
a
row
of
Union
soldiers
two
or
three
made
*NL*
him
think
of
dead
loves
and
dead
lovers
,
when
they
were
exactly
like
the
*NL*
rest
,
even
to
the
yellowish
moss
.
*NL*
*NL*
*****
*NL*
*NL*
Long
after
midnight
the
towers
and
spires
of
Princeton
were
visible
,
*NL*
with
here
and
there
a
late-burning
light
--
and
suddenly
out
of
the
clear
*NL*
darkness
the
sound
of
bells
.
As
an
endless
dream
it
went
on
;
the
spirit
*NL*
of
the
past
brooding
over
a
new
generation
,
the
chosen
youth
from
the
*NL*
muddled
,
unchastened
world
,
still
fed
romantically
on
the
mistakes
*NL*
and
half-forgotten
dreams
of
dead
statesmen
and
poets
.
Here
was
a
new
*NL*
generation
,
shouting
the
old
cries
,
learning
the
old
creeds
,
through
*NL*
a
revery
of
long
days
and
nights
;
destined
finally
to
go
out
into
that
*NL*
dirty
gray
turmoil
to
follow
love
and
pride
;
a
new
generation
dedicated
*NL*
more
than
the
last
to
the
fear
of
poverty
and
the
worship
of
success
;
*NL*
grown
up
to
find
all
Gods
dead
,
all
wars
fought
,
all
faiths
in
man
*NL*
shaken
...
*NL*
*NL*
Amory
,
sorry
for
them
,
was
still
not
sorry
for
himself
--
art
,
politics
,
*NL*
religion
,
whatever
his
medium
should
be
,
he
knew
he
was
safe
now
,
free
*NL*
from
all
hysteria
--
he
could
accept
what
was
acceptable
,
roam
,
grow
,
*NL*
rebel
,
sleep
deep
through
many
nights
...
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
God
in
his
heart
,
he
knew
;
his
ideas
were
still
in
riot
;
*NL*
there
was
ever
the
pain
of
memory
;
the
regret
for
his
lost
youth
--
yet
*NL*
the
waters
of
disillusion
had
left
a
deposit
on
his
soul
,
responsibility
*NL*
and
a
love
of
life
,
the
faint
stirring
of
old
ambitions
and
unrealized
*NL*
dreams
.
But
--
oh
,
Rosalind
!
Rosalind
!
...
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
all
a
poor
substitute
at
best
,
''
he
said
sadly
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
could
not
tell
why
the
struggle
was
worth
while
,
why
he
had
*NL*
determined
to
use
to
the
utmost
himself
and
his
heritage
from
the
*NL*
personalities
he
had
passed
...
*NL*
*NL*
He
stretched
out
his
arms
to
the
crystalline
,
radiant
sky
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
myself
,
''
he
cried
,
``
but
that
is
all

edition

The
primary
feature
of
edition
11
is
restoration
of
em-dashes
which
*NL*
are
missing
from
edition
10
.
-LRB-
My
favorite
instance
is
``
I
wo
n't
belong
''
*NL*
rather
than
``
I
wo
n't
be
--
long
''
.

*NL*
*NL*
Characters
which
are
8-bit
in
the
printed
text
were
misrepresented
in
*NL*
edition
10
.
Edition
10
had
some
end-of-paragraph
problems
.
A
handful
of
*NL*
other
minor
errors
are
corrected
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
volumes
served
as
reference
for
edition
11
:
a
1960
reprint
,
and
*NL*
an
undated
reprint
produced
sometime
after
1948
.
There
are
a
number
of
*NL*
differences
between
the
volumes
.
Evidence
suggests
that
the
1960
reprint
*NL*
has
been
somewhat
``
modernized
''
,
and
that
the
undated
reprint
is
a
*NL*
better
match
for
the
original
1920
printing
.
Therefore
,
when
the
volumes
*NL*
differ
,
edition
11
more
closely
follows
the
undated
reprint
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
edition
11
,
underscores
are
used
to
denote
words
and
phrases
*NL*
italicized

There
is
a
section
of
text
in
book
2
,
chapter
3
,
beginning
with
``
When
*NL*
Vanity
kissed
Vanity
,
''
which
is
referred
to
as
``
poetry
''
but
is
formatted
*NL*
as

I
considered
,
but
decided
against
introducing
an
8-bit
version
of
*NL*
edition
11
,
in
large
part
because
the
bulk
of
the
8-bit
usage
-LRB-
as
found
*NL*
in
the
1960
reprint
-RRB-
consists
of
words
commonly

:
